CHURCH BELL TOLLS

01:52.480 --> 01:53.680
Leah?

02:17.520 --> 02:19.360
Two minutes past six.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.880
I'm impressed. One word - why?

02:26.120 --> 02:29.440
Yeah, she's hot.
My mate reckons she's a selkie.

02:29.440 --> 02:33.520
A what? A selkie. A seal who
takes a beautiful human form.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.680
A seal? Yeah.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.400
They come on shore when there's
a problem they need to sort out.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.760
They're mostly found
off the coast of Scotland.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.320
Did you learn that in biology?

02:41.320 --> 02:44.760
No. I didn't say that
I think she's a selkie.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.000
Well, it's definitely a mystery.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.280
This is the PM report
of a female corpse

02:49.280 --> 02:52.240
that floated into Brixham
seven months ago.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.600
She was formally identified
as Leah Walker.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.080
How? DNA match.

02:56.080 --> 02:58.240
I didn't think two people
could have the same DNA.

02:58.240 --> 03:01.120
No, they can't - well, unless
they're identical twins -

03:01.120 --> 03:03.080
but Leah was an only child.

03:03.080 --> 03:07.280
Right. So...? So, we've got
a big question to answer.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.960
Is the person who walked out
of the sea really Leah Walker?

03:12.120 --> 03:13.360
Try again.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.280
Who was buried in Leah's place?

03:16.280 --> 03:17.640
There we go. Right.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.120
Good morning.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.800
OK, can you bring her
over to the mortuary?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.640
Oh, my days.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.400
No way...

03:41.400 --> 03:42.720
I know it's you!

03:42.720 --> 03:44.080
Beth!

03:46.880 --> 03:49.400
So, this is what
you look like at 6am.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.400
Hilarious(!)

03:51.400 --> 03:53.320
Hi, Clint. Beth.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.680
So, is there a body
in Leah's grave, then?

03:55.680 --> 03:58.720
As if we're going to tell you...
Yeah. Clint! Sorry.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.240
So, a seal really has
stolen Leah's skin?

04:03.600 --> 04:06.920
Your face! Did you honestly
think I'd believe that rubbish?

04:06.920 --> 04:09.240
Was there anything else,
before you go home?

04:09.240 --> 04:12.920
Yeah. Have you ever declared someone
dead while they're still alive?

04:12.920 --> 04:15.120
No. It should never happen.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.800
You were all on your boat,
moored off Bolt Head.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.240
Your parents were asleep
and you went for a swim.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.960
Yes. At 1am?

04:27.960 --> 04:29.720
I love swimming at night.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.000
We always made her
well aware of the risks.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.800
I remember lying on my back,

04:34.800 --> 04:36.720
my head in the water,

04:36.720 --> 04:39.400
looking up at this amazing,
clear sky.

04:40.720 --> 04:44.520
Then suddenly,
the water started shaking.

04:45.760 --> 04:49.880
I lifted my head and
there was a boat right there,

04:49.880 --> 04:52.440
headed straight for me.

04:52.440 --> 04:53.720
And then...

04:55.080 --> 04:57.480
..the stars, everything...

04:57.480 --> 04:58.880
It just went black.

05:00.520 --> 05:03.400
All right. And what's
the next thing you remember?

05:05.640 --> 05:07.320
This.

05:07.320 --> 05:10.800
Her memory seems to be resetting
itself every few hours.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.440
OK, let me get this straight.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.360
You remember everything up until
being hit on the head a year ago,

05:18.360 --> 05:19.640
but nothing since?

05:20.920 --> 05:23.720
When we first saw her, she said
she'd been close to the sea.

05:23.720 --> 05:27.240
Did I? You said it had been dark
and you could hear waves.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.360
Waves?

05:29.360 --> 05:30.800
Right.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.920
And you have absolutely
no recollection

05:32.920 --> 05:36.080
as to how you washed up on
Lighthaven beach two days ago?

05:37.520 --> 05:39.000
Sorry.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.680
Show him your arms, Leah.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.440
Any idea how you got those?

05:50.440 --> 05:52.160
No.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.040
They don't hurt.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.080
OK. Thanks.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.200
We need to know
what happened to her.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.760
I understand.
We'll do our best, Mrs Walker.

06:10.360 --> 06:13.800
So, we can expect a formal apology
in due course, can we?

06:13.800 --> 06:17.040
Well, I'm sure the coroner will be
in touch... I mean, from you!

06:17.040 --> 06:18.440
I'm sorry?

06:18.440 --> 06:21.560
For the harassment and insinuation
you subjected us to last summer.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.880
Peter... See, we were
going through hell...

06:23.880 --> 06:26.240
Mr Walker... ..but that
didn't stop you lot, did it?

06:26.240 --> 06:29.320
Muckraking your way through
every facet of our lives.

06:29.320 --> 06:32.120
I bet you wish you'd spent a bit
longer trying to find Leah now.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.360
With all due respect, sir,

06:33.360 --> 06:35.480
you and your wife were
the last people to see Leah.

06:35.480 --> 06:38.280
We needed to understand the nature
of your relationship with her.

06:38.280 --> 06:43.200
Now, I can understand... Hang on,
our relationship with our daughter
has always been first class!

06:43.200 --> 06:45.280
You'd better find out who did this.

06:53.960 --> 06:57.160
I'm in total shock, Jane.
I've got to be honest.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.640
Yeah? So are Leah's parents.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.760
Seven months ago,
you told my predecessor

07:00.760 --> 07:02.400
it was their daughter on the slab.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.720
I had a DNA match.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.920
The lab must have
mixed up the samples.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.040
Come on. We both know
how unlikely that is.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.360
Well, I can't think
what else it could be.

07:15.360 --> 07:18.040
Look, I was stressed, OK?
Fiona and I...

07:20.000 --> 07:22.360
..our IVF had just failed.
The fourth cycle.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.640
Unless you've been through it...

07:24.640 --> 07:27.080
It's not an excuse,

07:27.080 --> 07:29.520
but my mind was scrambled.

07:29.520 --> 07:32.040
What I'm saying is,
it could have been my mistake.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.360
I might have mixed up
the samples myself.

07:37.760 --> 07:40.760
How are you feeling now?
A lot better.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.000
Fiona and I gave it
one more go and...

07:44.600 --> 07:47.240
Well, success.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.400
When's the baby due? Four weeks.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.800
Congratulations.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.520
I'm guessing you're going
to have to file a report?

07:56.520 --> 07:58.480
Yes.

07:58.480 --> 08:03.000
Look, I know I don't deserve it,
but go easy on me?

08:03.000 --> 08:06.240
Fiona and I are going to need
the money more than ever now.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.160
Dark place, somewhere near the sea.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.560
You got any ideas?

08:27.720 --> 08:29.480
Lighthaven Swingers Club?

08:29.480 --> 08:31.880
Oh, you're a member too, then?

08:31.880 --> 08:35.120
Needle in a haystack job, is it?
It's worse than that, actually.

08:35.120 --> 08:38.679
It's like I'm looking for a haystack
that a needle used to be in.

08:38.679 --> 08:41.240
Right, what can I do for you?
No, don't tell me.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.280
You want to use my
missing persons database.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.000
You've forgotten your password
and you locked yourself out.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.720
What can I tell you?
I'm a detective genius.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.560
Clint called you. He did.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.360
You got anything to go on yet,
with your corpse?

08:55.360 --> 08:58.040
Angela? No, nothing yet.
You've given her a name?

08:58.040 --> 09:01.520
Yeah. Is that Leah's medical report?
Yeah.

09:05.280 --> 09:08.200
"Early diagnosis,
anterograde amnesia".

09:08.200 --> 09:11.080
Yeah, or in layman's terms,
chronic short-term memory loss.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.200
It's like she remembers
everything up until

09:13.200 --> 09:15.480
the point of being hit on
her head, but nothing since.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.320
Her memory keeps resetting.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.080
Like Dory in Finding Nemo?

09:19.080 --> 09:21.920
Yeah - or me, after three pints
of Mick's scrumpy.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.880
It's a bit...convenient, isn't it?

09:26.880 --> 09:29.720
I thought that.
Then I looked at the results.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.480
Fractured skull.

09:33.480 --> 09:34.880
Now, it has healed over,

09:34.880 --> 09:37.400
but it wasn't there before
she went off the boat.

09:37.400 --> 09:41.960
And she's got a whole chemist's
worth of diazepam in her system.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.640
Good for depression.
Not great for short-term memory.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.640
Yeah. Well, if the diazepam
is responsible

09:46.640 --> 09:48.200
for her short-term memory loss,

09:48.200 --> 09:50.800
then, hopefully, the effects
will be wearing off by now.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.120
It's a sedative, isn't it?

09:52.120 --> 09:54.520
Kind of fits,
because, wherever Leah's been,

09:54.520 --> 09:56.680
I don't think
she was there by choice.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.440
You think she was
held against her will?

09:59.440 --> 10:01.920
Look, there it is.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.960
"Indentations on
the subject's wrists

10:05.960 --> 10:09.840
"suggest prolonged restraint
by metallic instrument."

10:09.840 --> 10:11.880
I'd love to come up
with another theory.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.640
How was she, when she disappeared?

10:13.640 --> 10:15.240
Messed up her life.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.920
Split up with her boyfriend,
failed her A-levels.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.160
Sounds like most of the girls
I knew at 18.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.240
The boyfriend,
you obviously chased up...

10:22.240 --> 10:24.320
In America, yeah. The parents?

10:24.320 --> 10:26.720
She was an only child.
They're academics.

10:26.720 --> 10:30.120
Prefer stones to people,
you know the type.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.600
Funny, though -

10:31.600 --> 10:34.520
cos I could have sworn they were
holding something back last summer.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.200
Really? Hmm.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.440
Not that it matters now, though.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.920
I'm dusting off the
"known psychopath" file

10:40.920 --> 10:42.240
for this one, aren't I?

10:43.360 --> 10:46.640
WAVE RECORDING PLAYS

10:48.600 --> 10:51.120
Nothing. Sorry.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.800
I don't want to do this any more.
OK.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.040
Peter?

11:03.640 --> 11:05.280
RECORDING STOPS

11:05.280 --> 11:07.800
Leah, if you do think of anything...
I know.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.680
Mum... Why have you got a stick?

11:18.600 --> 11:20.120
You've told me already.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.520
Sorry.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.800
I've got cancer, darling.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.120
Is it serious?

11:30.480 --> 11:31.640
Yeah.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.320
Did you get it because
of worrying about me?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.560
I was just unlucky.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.840
But the important thing is
that, having you back,

11:39.840 --> 11:41.080
I feel so much better.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.040
DOORBELL RINGS

11:50.200 --> 11:52.320
I thought you'd taken your own life.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.880
We both did.

11:56.160 --> 11:59.680
Because of what was
happening to you and...

11:59.680 --> 12:01.040
what we said.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.400
DOOR SHUTS
Come on through. She's in here.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.560
Leah?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.000
Someone to see you.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.680
My lord...

12:17.120 --> 12:18.960
You remember your godfather, Tim?

12:18.960 --> 12:20.200
Of course.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.800
I hope she does!
I never missed a birthday.

12:24.480 --> 12:25.840
Come here, you.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.240
And it's lovely to see you both.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.040
Mmm?

12:39.040 --> 12:42.360
There's a do for Leah Walker later,
up at the Sailing Club.

12:42.360 --> 12:45.160
I've got to work, love.
But I want to go.

12:45.160 --> 12:49.280
Here. Scotch Wendy reckons
there's male selkies, as well.

12:50.360 --> 12:54.320
These male selkies come onshore and
seek out sexually unsatisfied women.

12:54.320 --> 12:57.120
They're completely irresistible
and totally insatiable.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.640
Isn't that right, Mick?

12:58.640 --> 13:01.320
What can I say? I've been rumbled.

13:15.200 --> 13:18.640
So, Angela, you were Caucasian,

13:18.640 --> 13:20.960
somewhere between 17 and 19.

13:20.960 --> 13:23.520
Most likely cause of death,
drowning.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.880
Signs of a slight curvature
in the spine.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.120
Not yet managed to get
a DNA sample from you,

13:32.120 --> 13:33.720
but that's normally a problem

13:33.720 --> 13:35.960
when you've been in
damp soil for a while.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.760
So, here's what's confusing -
you're five foot three.

13:42.760 --> 13:45.440
That's three inches shorter
than Leah Walker.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.520
So, of all the people that
George Flemington examined,

13:49.520 --> 13:51.640
why did he get you so wrong?

13:51.640 --> 13:55.160
Mum, hurry up! Oh! No! Not over that!

13:55.160 --> 13:58.280
Thanks for that! What?
How is that my fault?

13:58.280 --> 14:00.480
The party started
half an hour ago, by the way.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.800
Yes, all right!

14:25.040 --> 14:27.120
All right? Hey.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.440
What are you doing here?
I thought you were working.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.600
Beth insisted. Beth?

14:31.600 --> 14:34.280
She and Mum are a bit obsessed
with the miracle girl.

14:34.280 --> 14:38.520
Right. And you have absolutely
no interest whatsoever, right?

14:38.520 --> 14:41.040
She's alive, isn't she?
Why would I be?

14:41.040 --> 14:43.680
That's right, I forgot. Of course.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.080
Where's Annette?

14:45.080 --> 14:48.640
Oh, you know - EastEnders
is on tonight, isn't it?

14:48.640 --> 14:51.320
Ah. DS Higgins?

14:51.320 --> 14:52.680
Yeah, that's right.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.000
Tim Morris. We met last summer.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.440
Yeah, Leah.

14:57.440 --> 14:58.720
Right.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.880
So, what do you think?
Where's she been?

15:04.400 --> 15:07.760
We're investigating
a couple of avenues, you know?

15:09.880 --> 15:13.760
Well, I'm very glad that you and
your beautiful wife could make it.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.560
I'm...not his wife.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.480
Aren't you?

15:23.120 --> 15:25.160
Well, then...have fun.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.400
He's such an idiot.

15:32.840 --> 15:35.040
So, are you getting anywhere?

15:35.040 --> 15:38.000
We've identified a couple
of males in the area.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Both out of prison
in the last two years,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.600
both with previous that suggests
they're capable of kidnap.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.680
So, I'll give them a visit tomorrow.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.960
I just got a flashback, then.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.480
Ian Twitchett's 18th birthday party.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.200
We were standing right here.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.600
You don't remember?

15:57.600 --> 15:58.840
No.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.640
Course I do!

16:03.720 --> 16:05.720
We were going through
everyone at the party,

16:05.720 --> 16:08.320
predicting where they'd be
in 20 years' time.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.160
I'll go and get a drink.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.360
Yeah, I could use one myself.

16:21.320 --> 16:24.040
Hello, Leah. Hi.

16:24.040 --> 16:27.600
Sorry, have we...? I'm Beth.
I moved here not long ago.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.440
Oh. Right.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.640
Look, if you ever want to chat,
you know,

16:31.640 --> 16:35.440
to someone who's not the police,
or someone in a white coat... Thanks.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.320
There is something about her,
isn't there?

16:42.320 --> 16:43.520
Yeah.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.400
Hey, I wonder if she used to surf.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.720
What's he doing here?

16:50.720 --> 16:54.360
His wife's about to drop.
It's his last night out this decade.

16:54.360 --> 16:55.800
All right, George?

16:57.120 --> 17:00.360
Blimey. That's not his
first drink of the evening.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.240
He's got a nerve.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.680
Maybe he's come to say sorry.
"Sorry"?

17:04.680 --> 17:07.640
George is a good man.
He's in my Black Dog darts team.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.480
He screwed up, big time.

17:09.480 --> 17:11.000
Don't hang the bloke.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.560
You never messed things up
and regretted it straightaway?

17:13.560 --> 17:14.920
I know I have.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.560
Please don't tell me what to think.

17:26.280 --> 17:29.040
I used to do a lot of boarding,
actually - at my school.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.920
Cool. Where did you go?

17:30.920 --> 17:32.400
St Tristan's.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.120
St Tristan's does surfing?

17:35.120 --> 17:38.800
I thought you were all
just a bunch of swots there.

17:38.800 --> 17:42.360
Oh! BOARDING school. Right!

17:43.440 --> 17:46.840
Wait... St Tristan's is, like,
ten miles from here.

17:46.840 --> 17:50.040
Why were you boarding there,
if you live here?

17:50.040 --> 17:53.960
My parents are into two things -
their jobs and each other.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.600
I just got in the way.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.640
Hi, Clint. Want to grab a drink?

17:57.640 --> 17:59.720
I'm fine, thanks.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.200
That's my boss.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.480
Hello. I'm Jane. Welcome back.
Jane's a coroner.

18:04.480 --> 18:07.840
She's trying to work out
who was buried in your grave.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.200
Right.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.160
Well, it was nice to meet you,
Clint. Bye.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.080
Too much information?

18:18.080 --> 18:19.440
Don't worry about it.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.880
In an hour, she'll forget
she ever met you.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.000
Leah. Leah!
They're going to laugh at you.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.280
Do you want them to laugh at you?

18:51.280 --> 18:53.880
Leah, please!

18:53.880 --> 18:56.920
Stop being such a child! I am sorry.

18:56.920 --> 18:58.400
Get off me!

19:00.400 --> 19:02.040
Can we just talk about it?

19:03.320 --> 19:04.640
Leah!

19:07.480 --> 19:10.200
MUSIC PLAYS

19:37.600 --> 19:39.920
That was a great party, Gina.
Thank you.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.640
Hey. You all right?

19:41.640 --> 19:43.400
Yeah. Why shouldn't I be?

19:43.400 --> 19:45.080
Just asking.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.960
Thought you went ages ago, George!

19:46.960 --> 19:50.000
I forgot something.
Mind scrambled again?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.880
Bit harsh, isn't it? Fair.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.120
You need to hear this.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.720
What's that, Mr Walker?
Leah's remembered something.

19:57.720 --> 19:58.920
Leah?

20:00.080 --> 20:01.600
It's the painting.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.440
Leah? I've seen this recently.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.600
You mean, since your accident?

20:11.800 --> 20:13.640
This exact picture? Yes.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.600
Did you see it here?

20:16.600 --> 20:17.760
No.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.000
It was in a room.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.680
MAN BREATHES HEAVILY

20:22.680 --> 20:24.600
There were no windows.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.720
There was an orange lamp.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.800
GIRL'S SOBBING ECHOES

20:33.960 --> 20:37.000
MUSIC: I'm Not The Only One
by Sam Smith

20:42.640 --> 20:44.240
KNOCKS AT DOOR

20:44.240 --> 20:45.600
Morning.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.000
Morning.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.200
Mind if I turn this down? Well...

20:50.280 --> 20:55.680
Right, so last night, I went to see
that artist that did the painting.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.320
Turns out he lives in Westchurch.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.120
Do you know it's 7.30?

20:59.120 --> 21:02.320
Yeah. Anyway... Helpful bloke.

21:03.680 --> 21:07.240
Gave me a list of people that
he knows that bought the prints.

21:08.280 --> 21:11.120
Tim Morris has one? Yup.

21:11.120 --> 21:13.160
Bit of a coincidence, isn't it?

21:13.160 --> 21:15.360
You don't think he kidnapped
Leah, though, do you?

21:15.360 --> 21:17.000
Well, it might be worth checking out,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
especially since
you heard them rowing.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.800
Gina Morris would have noticed.
Not necessarily.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.600
Right, have a look at this.

21:25.720 --> 21:27.840
Tim Morris's holiday homes.

21:27.840 --> 21:30.240
All in the South Hams.
I got it off the internet.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.440
You have been a busy boy.

21:32.440 --> 21:33.840
Have a look at this one.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.360
According to the
lettings agent's website,

21:37.360 --> 21:40.920
it was taken off the market
last summer. It's being "upgraded".

21:40.920 --> 21:43.880
Now, I can't get a search
warrant with what I've got.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.640
And the lettings agent guy,
he knows me.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.360
You want me to get the keys?

21:48.360 --> 21:51.440
Well, you've got a lower profile
than I have around here, no offence.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.680
And a nicer pair of pins.

21:53.680 --> 21:57.600
Come on, what do you say?
You can come with me, if you like?

21:57.600 --> 21:59.680
All right, I'll get dressed.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.720
Nice one, Davey.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.040
Jane!

22:58.520 --> 23:01.120
Not exactly a dungeon, is it?

23:02.120 --> 23:04.320
More like a love nest.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.000
Davey.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.520
They can't find Tim Morris?

23:22.520 --> 23:25.520
No. I was the last one to see him
head out of the Sailing Club.

23:25.520 --> 23:28.280
So, what's this lead on Angela?
Ah, French girl.

23:28.280 --> 23:30.280
Isabelle Freres. 19.

23:30.280 --> 23:33.760
Got on a ferry at Roscoff in June
last year, no record of her since.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.960
And check out the height.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.760
Ah, five foot three.
Look at you, Sherlock.

23:38.760 --> 23:42.040
OK, let's get her records
sent through from France. OK.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.360
Leah, is this where you were?

24:01.320 --> 24:03.280
I'll kill him.

24:03.280 --> 24:04.760
Come on.

24:07.640 --> 24:12.040
She wasn't faking it, so I've doubled
up the team out looking for Morris.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.040
I'm getting that face.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.760
What face?

24:15.760 --> 24:17.760
I don't make that face!

24:19.280 --> 24:22.040
So what you're saying is,
Morris kidnapped Leah

24:22.040 --> 24:24.280
after he hit her with the boat?
Yeah.

24:24.280 --> 24:26.760
Did he hit her deliberately?
Possibly.

24:26.760 --> 24:30.040
So she'd lose her memory?
No. He got lucky there.

24:30.040 --> 24:33.040
My point is, he would have
kidnapped her whatever.

24:33.040 --> 24:35.520
I didn't hear waves
from that basement?

24:35.520 --> 24:39.040
All I know is, something really bad
happened to Leah down there.

24:39.040 --> 24:42.520
Her memory comes back and Morris does
a runner. How does that look to you?

24:42.520 --> 24:44.040
Not good for Morris.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.040
Do I really make that face?

24:47.040 --> 24:49.760
Any joy identifying your skeleton?
Fingers crossed.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.040
There's a French girl.
She's the right age.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.280
MOBILE PHONE
Hello, Sylvie?

24:54.280 --> 24:56.840
Yeah, I know. You're all right.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.000
You're kidding.

25:14.960 --> 25:18.520
Forensics reckon he's been dead
between eight and 14 hours.

25:18.520 --> 25:22.720
They think he was pushed,
hit his head on that. Ouch.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.960
Maybe they didn't want him
to finish this.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.760
"Dear Peter and Molly,
this is the hardest note..."

25:28.760 --> 25:31.280
I didn't think people wrote
letters any more.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.520
I guess they do if it's important.
Any sign of forced entry?

25:34.520 --> 25:37.040
No. I think he knew the killer
pretty well.

25:38.040 --> 25:40.280
He must have dropped this
in the struggle.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.280
Do you know who it belongs to?

25:43.280 --> 25:44.960
I do.

26:14.760 --> 26:17.040
I left that phone...

26:17.040 --> 26:19.720
in my jacket pocket.

26:22.760 --> 26:26.360
When I took my jacket from the
cloakroom at the end of the evening,

26:26.360 --> 26:28.680
it wasn't there. It was gone.

26:28.680 --> 26:31.320
There were no-one else's
fingerprints on it.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.040
You're loving this, aren't you?

26:39.040 --> 26:41.000
You've dreamed of having me here.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.080
No, not really.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.760
So where did you go after the party?
Home.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.600
With Molly and Leah.

26:50.600 --> 26:53.160
Molly went to bed.

26:53.160 --> 26:56.200
Leah and I talked. All night?

26:56.200 --> 26:58.520
There was a lot to talk about.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.680
Now, Mr Walker...

27:01.680 --> 27:03.760
..I don't have kids.

27:04.760 --> 27:07.400
But I do understand
how angry you must feel.

27:07.400 --> 27:10.520
And so will a judge,
so I think, if you confess now,

27:10.520 --> 27:13.640
you'll probably have the whole
of Devon on your side.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.280
Why would I have killed Tim?

27:19.040 --> 27:22.040
Last night,
he was still my best friend.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.400
Yes!

27:28.400 --> 27:31.040
Someone else die? No. No!

27:31.040 --> 27:35.040
Some clever scientist has managed
to get usable DNA from a corpse.

27:35.040 --> 27:38.440
How perfectly charming.
I don't want people to die, Mick.

27:38.440 --> 27:41.200
No, but it keeps you in a job,
don't it? Well, yes.

27:45.360 --> 27:48.520
So if Tim Morris was
killed on his boat,

27:48.520 --> 27:51.680
how come that house of his
is a crime scene?

27:51.680 --> 27:54.080
Which house? Skylight.

27:55.280 --> 27:58.280
Even if I knew, I wouldn't be able
to tell you, would I, Mick?

27:58.280 --> 28:01.280
That's all right. I reckon
I could guess. Go on, then.

28:01.280 --> 28:05.080
That was Morris' love palace.
What do you mean?

28:05.080 --> 28:07.760
You know, where he took
all his "other women".

28:07.760 --> 28:11.760
Morris was a player, Jane.
You must have worked that one out.

28:12.760 --> 28:15.040
Where's all this come from?
John "the Join".

28:15.040 --> 28:18.520
Does odd carpentry jobs for Morris.
Did, I should say.

28:18.520 --> 28:21.040
On his holiday lets and the like.

28:21.040 --> 28:24.280
Apparently, Morris stopped renting
out Skylight last summer.

28:24.280 --> 28:28.280
Every time John's been in since,
he reckons he can smell perfume.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.040
Really? Mm.

28:30.040 --> 28:32.960
Not only that,
but different perfume every time.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.760
Jane Kennedy from the Coroner's
Office. I need to speak to Leah.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.040
She's gone.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.280
Where?

28:48.280 --> 28:49.760
I don't know.

28:50.760 --> 28:53.280
Well, do you know
when she'll be back?

28:53.280 --> 28:55.040
She left a note.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.760
What did she take with her?
Just her bike.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.760
That girl has absolutely nothing
to be sorry about.

29:14.040 --> 29:17.040
I've been the worst mother
I could be.

29:18.040 --> 29:21.760
Molly, did anything happen
between you and Leah last summer?

29:21.760 --> 29:25.680
Any problem you and your husband
didn't tell the police about?

29:27.160 --> 29:29.440
Please. It could help us find her.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.040
She came to us,

29:33.040 --> 29:34.760
me and Peter...

29:34.760 --> 29:37.000
a week before she disappeared.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.440
She was pregnant.

29:41.440 --> 29:44.240
A one-night thing, you know, but...

29:44.240 --> 29:47.560
Leah had made up her mind
to keep the baby.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.520
And what did you say?

29:54.800 --> 29:56.760
I wasn't sympathetic...

29:57.760 --> 29:59.400
..at all.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.320
Neither of us were.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.840
She'd just messed up her A-levels.

30:06.840 --> 30:09.040
We'd spent a lot of money on her.

30:10.040 --> 30:13.040
We said some terrible,
terrible things.

30:14.040 --> 30:16.040
Just when she needed us most.

30:26.520 --> 30:29.040
What is it?
Leah wasn't held in Skylight.

30:29.040 --> 30:33.040
I've just spoken to a carpenter
who swears he's been in and out
of there all year.

30:33.040 --> 30:37.520
That doesn't change anything.
Peter Walker probably killed Tim
Morris. I need to speak to Leah.

30:37.520 --> 30:40.040
She's his alibi.
Davey, she's run away. What?

30:40.040 --> 30:44.240
You were right. Her parents were
holding something back last summer.

30:52.240 --> 30:54.040
All right, Sarge?

30:55.280 --> 30:57.320
No sign of anyone. Right.

30:58.320 --> 31:00.400
Is that it?

31:08.560 --> 31:10.600
TRAIN TOOTS

31:20.240 --> 31:21.680
Leah?

32:03.520 --> 32:05.560
MOBILE PHONE

32:07.760 --> 32:09.720
Hi, Beth. You OK?

32:11.520 --> 32:13.280
Are you sure it's her?

32:13.280 --> 32:15.440
OK, Beth, do not let her
out of your sight.

32:15.440 --> 32:17.760
It's really important.
Do you understand?

32:17.760 --> 32:20.280
We'll be there as soon as we can.
OK, love. Bye.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.760
Davey!

32:23.760 --> 32:25.640
She's in Kingsport.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.480
MOBILE PHONE

33:18.040 --> 33:20.080
CAR SCREECHES TO A HALT

33:25.240 --> 33:27.360
I can't see you, Beth.
Where are you?

33:27.360 --> 33:29.080
Hurry up.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.280
Hurry up! I see you.

33:50.040 --> 33:51.840
Nice one, Beth.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.920
What do we do now?

34:13.040 --> 34:15.760
Water taxi!
Water taxi, I need your boat.

34:15.760 --> 34:17.280
Stay here.

34:36.040 --> 34:40.040
Doesn't this thing go any faster?
Six knots only on the river.

34:42.520 --> 34:45.520
Look, they're heading for
that gin palace over there.

34:53.239 --> 34:55.280
Where am I going to find the girl,
mate?

34:55.280 --> 34:57.760
You're going to find her in two.
Room two? Room two.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.160
Fine. Thanks.

35:00.160 --> 35:02.040
She's in room two, apparently.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.760
Either that or he's telling me
to get me off his boat.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.520
It's down there.

35:06.520 --> 35:09.040
Look, do you want to go and get her?
Why?

35:10.040 --> 35:13.040
I don't know. You're a mother.
You've got a daughter.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.520
OK.

35:26.280 --> 35:28.040
Hello again.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.280
Mind if I sit down?

35:37.040 --> 35:40.200
Bit compact,
but I guess you get used to it.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.840
I see they kept your things for you.

35:47.360 --> 35:50.720
There was never anything wrong
with your memory, was there?

35:51.920 --> 35:54.920
Did Tim always take you to Skylight
to do it?

35:56.760 --> 35:59.040
He got you pregnant, didn't he?

36:06.640 --> 36:09.040
Come on, Leah,
you can't keep running.

36:16.040 --> 36:19.040
Tim said, if I had the baby,
his life would be over.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.760
He was threatening me.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.520
So I finally decided
to tell my parents.

36:24.520 --> 36:26.760
That was a big deal, right?

36:26.760 --> 36:28.520
We weren't close.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.360
All right, then what?

36:30.360 --> 36:32.040
They lost it too.

36:33.040 --> 36:35.040
I didn't even mention Tim.

36:35.040 --> 36:37.040
Mum just went off on this rant

36:37.040 --> 36:40.040
about how having me young
was her "biggest mistake".

36:40.040 --> 36:42.520
That I'd cost her
a "stellar" career.

36:43.520 --> 36:46.040
But at least she had an education.

36:46.040 --> 36:48.040
I've already messed mine up.

36:49.760 --> 36:51.520
And Dad...

36:51.520 --> 36:53.360
just...

36:53.360 --> 36:55.120
sat there.

36:55.120 --> 36:59.040
I never felt like
they particularly needed me.

37:00.040 --> 37:02.040
But in that moment...

37:02.040 --> 37:04.760
I felt like I barely existed.

37:06.280 --> 37:09.520
All I could think was that,
maybe when I was dead,

37:09.520 --> 37:11.760
they would finally appreciate me.

37:12.760 --> 37:15.720
But you didn't kill yourself.
I couldn't.

37:16.720 --> 37:19.280
Not with a baby inside me.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.800
So you got yourself
a job on this boat.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.760
And you called yourself...

37:23.760 --> 37:25.760
Sally Jefferies.

37:25.760 --> 37:28.000
Where do you go on this thing?

37:28.000 --> 37:29.520
Everywhere.

37:31.040 --> 37:34.040
Someone at school
videoed my funeral.

37:34.040 --> 37:36.040
Put it on YouTube.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.520
I watched it.

37:39.440 --> 37:41.560
It was horrible.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.120
My parents...

37:44.120 --> 37:46.040
seeing them like that.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.040
I hardly recognised them.

37:50.280 --> 37:52.400
I think that's why I miscarried.

37:54.760 --> 37:57.040
Didn't you want to go back then
and there?

37:57.040 --> 37:58.360
Yes.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.280
But I was scared.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.520
And embarrassed.

38:03.520 --> 38:05.440
So you hid on the boat?

38:07.520 --> 38:10.280
My dad has a Facebook page.

38:10.280 --> 38:12.280
Mostly for his students.

38:13.520 --> 38:15.520
One day he put this message on

38:15.520 --> 38:18.760
saying that Mum had got some
bad news from the doctors.

38:18.760 --> 38:21.280
I knew he meant she was dying.

38:22.280 --> 38:24.760
So I decided to come back.

38:26.520 --> 38:30.520
Oleg, the boat owner, said we'd be
back in Devon in two months.

38:31.520 --> 38:34.040
But I needed some kind of a story,

38:34.040 --> 38:37.040
so I bought some handcuffs
and slept in them every night.

38:37.040 --> 38:40.520
And I started taking pills.
What about the fractured skull?

38:40.520 --> 38:43.960
A few weeks after I came on board,
I was jumping off the boat

38:43.960 --> 38:45.760
and I hit the side.

38:45.760 --> 38:48.360
I really did have to be
fished out the water.

38:48.360 --> 38:51.040
Tim treated you badly over the baby.
I get that.

38:51.040 --> 38:53.440
But...framing him for kidnap?

38:55.440 --> 38:58.760
Tim and I only actually
had sex once.

39:01.080 --> 39:03.000
And it was...

39:03.000 --> 39:04.240
What?

39:06.040 --> 39:07.760
I liked him.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.640
But I wasn't ready.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.280
I told him, but he...

39:15.800 --> 39:17.400
..insisted.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.520
It was my first time.

39:21.520 --> 39:24.040
I thought that's what it was like.

39:27.520 --> 39:29.520
And this was in that basement?

39:30.520 --> 39:33.280
I grew up a lot on this boat.

39:35.760 --> 39:38.280
When I confronted Tim at the party,

39:38.280 --> 39:41.040
I expected some remorse or...

39:41.040 --> 39:43.640
guilt or something.

39:43.640 --> 39:46.040
You know what you did, Tim.

39:46.040 --> 39:48.280
Darling,
you came to that house alone.

39:48.280 --> 39:51.760
What did you expect? What did you
think was going to happen? Not that!

39:51.760 --> 39:53.760
I'm going to the police. Leah.

39:53.760 --> 39:56.880
Leah! They'll laugh at you.
Do you want them to laugh at you?

39:56.880 --> 39:58.120
Leah!

39:58.120 --> 40:00.760
That was when I decided
he had to pay.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.840
And he did.

40:06.440 --> 40:08.280
Has my dad confessed?

40:19.520 --> 40:22.040
Not the greatest day
of Peter Walker's life.

40:22.040 --> 40:25.040
Yes. I've just been handed these,
actually.

40:26.040 --> 40:29.480
I think his fortunes might be
about to turn a corner.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.400
Davey?

40:35.760 --> 40:38.520
You always said it was
taking its toll, George.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.040
The IVF.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.040
Wasn't the stress, though, was it?

40:45.040 --> 40:48.040
It was the cash.
Sorry, mate, you've lost me.

40:48.040 --> 40:50.560
Your bank statements...mate.

40:51.560 --> 40:53.040
You're skint.

40:54.040 --> 40:56.280
Erm...what's this about?

40:56.280 --> 40:58.760
Tim Morris knew, though, didn't he?

40:58.760 --> 41:00.760
Sailing Club grapevine.

41:00.760 --> 41:04.280
And he was pretty sure he was the
reason Leah had committed suicide.

41:04.280 --> 41:07.760
Seeing Peter and Molly suffering
every day, that made it worse,

41:07.760 --> 41:09.520
so he made you an offer.

41:09.520 --> 41:12.280
A body for the Walkers to grieve over
in exchange for

41:12.280 --> 41:15.320
as many IVF treatments as you needed.
You couldn't resist.

41:15.320 --> 41:18.280
Sorry...what exactly are you...?

41:18.280 --> 41:22.400
The money trail, George. It's all
here. Tim, you, the IVF clinic.

41:24.520 --> 41:28.280
Everything would have been great
until Leah came back to life.

41:28.280 --> 41:32.120
At the party, Tim was convinced
she was going to accuse him of rape.

41:32.120 --> 41:33.360
You panicked.

41:33.360 --> 41:36.040
He told you he was going to
admit his affair with Leah

41:36.040 --> 41:38.760
to Peter and Molly,
try and legitimise the situation,

41:38.760 --> 41:41.760
so he went back to his boat
to write a letter, but you knew

41:41.760 --> 41:44.760
the police heat on Morris
would expose your collaboration

41:44.760 --> 41:47.560
and you weren't going to miss
the birth of your first child.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.360
I'm going to go to prison.

41:50.360 --> 41:53.520
George, right now, you are the
last thing I'm bothered about.

41:53.520 --> 41:55.400
Tim...

41:55.400 --> 41:57.280
please!

42:02.280 --> 42:03.520
George!

42:10.760 --> 42:13.040
Must have been terrifying, George.

42:13.040 --> 42:16.280
But somehow you were calm enough
to go back to the cloakroom

42:16.280 --> 42:19.520
at the Sailing Club, and you took
Peter Walker's mobile phone

42:19.520 --> 42:21.280
from his coat pocket.

42:21.280 --> 42:25.040
A man about to find out his best
friend had seduced his daughter.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.760
And you framed him.

42:35.520 --> 42:39.080
George Flemington, I'm arresting
you for the murder of Tim Morris.

42:54.280 --> 42:57.040
I am so sorry.

43:03.040 --> 43:05.520
I think your mum and I have...

43:07.520 --> 43:11.920
..I don't know, done a very bad job
of showing how much we care.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.280
Damn!

43:26.760 --> 43:30.280
There's a place in my darts team
if you fancy it? Tempting!

43:32.040 --> 43:33.520
What's up?

43:33.520 --> 43:36.760
I've just heard back from Interpol.
Angela's DNA didn't match.

43:36.760 --> 43:40.280
What, with that French girl?
No. With anyone in the world.
