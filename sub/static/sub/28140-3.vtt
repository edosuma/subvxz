00:25.640 --> 00:27.313
Just don't... talk too much

00:27.400 --> 00:29.416
or try to pretend you know anything
about the company.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.750
OK.
- And don't be funny or clever or...

00:31.960 --> 00:33.456
Just don't be the centre of attention.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.856
These people are very important to me

00:34.880 --> 00:36.155
so just don't...
- OK.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.714
...don't be yourself.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.190
I won't.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.276
Fuck's sake.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.638
I know people in this building.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.680
Anyone could come...

00:53.640 --> 00:54.640
Hi, Claire.

00:54.760 --> 00:55.760
Hello, Leslie.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.794
Ooh, that's lovely.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.235
What is that?

01:09.640 --> 01:11.279
We have a load of vegetarians

01:11.320 --> 01:13.216
so make sure it's clear
which ones have meat in them.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.496
Loves a crisis.
- We have a couple

01:14.520 --> 01:15.576
of waitresses for the drinks

01:15.600 --> 01:17.056
so if you could hand round the food.
- Mm-hmm.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.376
Put her in a quiet room
with a nice breeze

01:18.400 --> 01:20.176
she'll have a panic attack.
- Where is everyone?

01:20.200 --> 01:21.200
She's so happy.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.874
God, this is stressful.

01:23.920 --> 01:25.560
Don't be weird
about how big my office is.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.834
What the fuck?

01:28.080 --> 01:29.355
- I know.
- Are you a...

01:29.480 --> 01:31.756
It's over the top. I know. OK.

01:31.880 --> 01:33.553
Put them on the table.
Not that table.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.275
Oh. You OK?
- Of course. It's just

01:36.360 --> 01:37.510
it's just, it's a big night

01:37.600 --> 01:39.760
and the Finnish partners are here,
so it's all a bit...

01:40.480 --> 01:42.551
- Oh, check the award.
- Why?

01:42.760 --> 01:45.216
Just to make sure it's not pink
or anything horrifically female.

01:45.240 --> 01:46.240
She'll loathe that.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.078
Be careful with it.
It's worth thousands.

01:48.280 --> 01:49.760
It's not pink.
- Good.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.480
It's perfect.
It looks like a sperm.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.000
Your hair looks nice.
- Shut up.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.393
OK, don't sit on that.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.034
OK, put those on the posh plates.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.640
Put the award
behind the microphone.

01:59.760 --> 02:00.910
Oh, and, um...

02:06.880 --> 02:07.880
Thank you.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.316
You've really, uh...

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Thank you.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.513
Don't play with that.

02:20.480 --> 02:21.675
Oh, that's heavy. Argh!

02:25.840 --> 02:28.355
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

02:28.680 --> 02:29.830
My God.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.113
Where have you been?
- Oh, sorry.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.696
I just had to get the vegetarian bites.
But it's all fine.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.916
You're gonna love them.
- You're sweating so much.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.559
Sorry.
- It's attention-grabbing.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.757
It's only on one side.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.515
Um, sorry, this is, uh, Sylvia.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.256
She's going to be
presenting the award

03:22.280 --> 03:24.715
so when you hear me
introduce her, get her onstage.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.678
Hi.
- Has this got shellfish in it?

03:26.880 --> 03:28.439
No.
- Fine.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.520
Four CEOs have been fired.
Two are being taken to court.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.755
I mean, it's just sad.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.195
We felt like a family.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.576
Yeah. Especially sad
when you have to tell your family

03:36.600 --> 03:38.592
not to touch each other up
by the photocopier.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.353
Stop making jokes.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.880
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
- You can.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.711
Oh, Belinda's coming.
Don't speak to Belinda.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.920
Hello, Claire.
- Hello, Belinda.

03:50.280 --> 03:51.839
God, you're tasteful.
- Mm.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.310
Ooh, are these meaty?

03:58.880 --> 04:00.109
Say something.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.336
Um, no,
I think they have courgette in them.

04:01.360 --> 04:02.874
Oh, I love courgette.

04:03.480 --> 04:06.279
You can treat them appallingly
and they still grow.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.598
She seems lovely.
- Yeah, she's great.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.760
So who are you so nervous about?

04:14.880 --> 04:17.156
I'm not nervous.
I'm being completely...

04:17.200 --> 04:18.793
Claire!
- Oh!

04:19.160 --> 04:20.435
Hi. Oh!
- Oh, wow.

04:20.519 --> 04:23.080
Oh, sorry. I-I'm-I'm so glad
you could come.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.879
- Of course. It's my job.
- Ah.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.718
This is my catering.
She's the sister.

04:26.760 --> 04:27.955
Hi.
- Ah.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.396
I ate a sausage over there,
thinking it was a prune.

04:30.440 --> 04:31.440
Oh.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.278
Fifteen years of vegetarianism, gone.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.356
Like bang, bang.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.470
Oh.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.896
We do actually call them "bangers."

04:36.920 --> 04:38.673
Ah! That's funny!

04:38.800 --> 04:39.950
Yes, it was.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.920
So, how do you two know each other?

04:43.120 --> 04:44.873
Uh, we're partners.
- Uh, we are partners.

04:45.240 --> 04:47.096
Um, business partners in, um...
- Yes. She's been working with me

04:47.120 --> 04:48.600
- in Finland, and, uh...
- Yes.

04:48.720 --> 04:49.720
We don't get to see each other

04:49.721 --> 04:51.120
that much, but I'm...
- No, exactly.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.480
I'm a huge...
- I'm a big fan.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.552
Thank you. Admirer.

04:57.520 --> 04:59.716
I'm going to get a drink.
Do you want anything?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.678
Oh. Uh, champagne, please.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.296
Oh, off the wagon?

05:03.320 --> 05:04.515
Oh, just when I'm with you.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.273
Let's go fucking crazy tonight, then.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.914
Hmm?

05:10.720 --> 05:11.720
What did you say?

05:12.040 --> 05:13.793
No, no. I, um, I was...

05:13.880 --> 05:15.439
No, what did you say?
- Oh, just, uh

05:15.760 --> 05:16.760
uh...

05:16.960 --> 05:18.872
I just said,
"Let's go fuck like crazy tonight."

05:20.400 --> 05:21.400
Oh, God. Uh...

05:21.640 --> 05:23.996
OK!

05:32.800 --> 05:33.800
Shut up.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.240
Oh, my God.

05:35.320 --> 05:38.119
He is a very good businessman.
He's just socially sort of...

05:38.280 --> 05:39.714
And what's, um...
- Shut up.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.077
Claire.
- Please don't. Please don't.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.039
I can't cope. OK?

05:43.040 --> 05:44.076
OK.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.120
What's his name?

05:48.360 --> 05:49.360
What's his name?

05:50.960 --> 05:51.960
Klare.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.320
What?

05:56.400 --> 05:57.675
His name is Klare.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.314
Don't.
- Mm.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.552
Oh, God, I have to announce.
OK, mingle.

06:03.720 --> 06:04.995
But don't talk to anyone.
- OK.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.355
I'm not in love with him.

06:06.680 --> 06:07.680
OK.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.553
Hi, everyone.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.155
I am very proud
to announce the nominees

06:18.240 --> 06:20.152
for the Women in Business Awards

06:20.680 --> 06:22.160
sponsored by us here at Hurbots.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.393
Amongst our exceptional women

06:24.520 --> 06:26.751
we have Georgina Franks.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.235
Belinda Friers.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.596
And another extraordinary woman

06:36.200 --> 06:37.475
Klare Korhonen.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.309
Oh, uh, sorry. I-I think
there's been a mistake here.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.472
I... and, uh, Elizabeth Sawkin.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.030
Congratulations to you all.
Have a wonderful evening.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.271
We will be presenting the award
very soon.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.030
I'm gonna introduce Sylvia

06:55.120 --> 06:56.176
who's gonna introduce Belinda.
- Uh-huh.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.056
When you hear me introducing
Sylvia, get her onstage.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.799
It has to go like "cockwork."
- Like what?

07:00.640 --> 07:01.640
"Cockwork."

07:01.840 --> 07:03.056
Claire, your brain
is somewhere else right now.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.639
Just... Sylvia. Go.

07:05.880 --> 07:06.950
Sylvia.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.155
Crap.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.599
A huge thanks to Matthew,
Mark Luke and John

07:17.680 --> 07:18.955
for coming up with this award

07:19.040 --> 07:22.431
and to Linkedln for connecting
us all this evening and beyond.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.118
I am so excited
to introduce Sylvia Hamber

07:26.240 --> 07:28.311
this year's winner
of Women Who Work...

07:28.480 --> 07:30.520
...who will announce this year's

07:30.600 --> 07:32.671
Best Woman in Business. Sylvia.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.800
What an entrance!

07:44.720 --> 07:45.720
I'll do it.

07:47.480 --> 07:48.516
I can do it.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.476
Um, I'm sorry.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.671
It appears that Sylvia is busy

07:53.760 --> 07:56.434
which shouldn't come
as a surprise, really.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.280
Uh...

07:58.360 --> 08:01.080
It's-it's been a big year
for business.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.799
Particularly women in business.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.874
Men have been pretty hands-on
the past few decades.

08:09.680 --> 08:12.639
I'd like to thank
all the brilliant men and women

08:12.800 --> 08:14.553
for supporting each other
here at Hurbots.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.472
We're a... a family, really.

08:16.640 --> 08:18.696
And if we've learned anything
during the past 12 months

08:18.720 --> 08:20.951
it's that family really
shouldn't touch each other up

08:21.040 --> 08:22.040
next to the photocopier.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.076
Funny!

08:27.160 --> 08:29.550
I am honoured to present this award

08:29.800 --> 08:32.871
to this year's
Best Woman in Business...

08:34.480 --> 08:35.674
Belinda Friers.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.520
Fuck's sake!

09:00.840 --> 09:02.832
Thank you, thank... thank you.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.320
Well, um...

09:07.720 --> 09:09.496
Well, I was going to say this is a bit
on the nose

09:09.520 --> 09:11.751
but she doesn't seem to have one.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.759
What were you thinking?
- It'll be fine.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.952
It's not fine. I awarded her
with a pair of tits.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.120
Chase her down.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.955
Chase her down?
- It's a stolen piece of art.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.416
I will deal with the photographer.

09:23.440 --> 09:24.760
- Claire!
- Oh!

09:24.800 --> 09:26.792
Oh, my God, you were brilliant.

09:26.840 --> 09:29.036
Thank you, Klare.
- I loved the joke.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.511
Ah.
- Oh, well, I didn't think it was that funny.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.280
Can you go, my love?

09:33.400 --> 09:34.993
Oh, I'm just gonna...
- Take the stairs.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.794
OK.

09:56.640 --> 09:57.994
I'm trained in martial arts.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.720
It's just the basics, but it is enough.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.240
I work at Harbots.

10:01.520 --> 10:02.520
Hurbots.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.832
Yes, I ate a courgette off your tray.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.550
Yeah.
- It was delicious.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.239
Thank you.
- What do you want?

10:10.600 --> 10:11.600
That.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.196
I-I need to take your award back.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.832
Why?
- It's a stolen piece of art.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.240
It's not really an award.
It's all my fault. I can explain.

10:20.600 --> 10:21.750
Is it a long story?

10:22.720 --> 10:23.720
Sort of.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.520
And she still doesn't
know you have it?

10:27.600 --> 10:29.910
That's glorious.

10:30.240 --> 10:31.840
I think you did exactly the right thing.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.992
I think you're the only person
who thinks that.

10:34.520 --> 10:37.831
God. Women's awards.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Congratulations.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.231
Oh, it's infantilising bollocks.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.993
Well, don't you think it's good that...

10:44.080 --> 10:45.912
No. No. It's ghettoising.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.872
It's a subsection of success.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.470
Ah, it's the fucking
children's table of awards.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.836
Why did you go?

10:54.480 --> 10:56.153
Because I'd be an arsehole not to.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.320
Ms Friers.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.600
Thank you, darling.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.240
Gosh, she's hot.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.600
Yeah.

11:03.320 --> 11:04.320
Are you a lesbian?

11:04.560 --> 11:06.199
Not strictly. You?
- Mm.

11:06.440 --> 11:09.160
Mm. Do you like old films?
- Some.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.153
And what's your favourite period film?

11:12.840 --> 11:13.840
Carrie.

11:16.800 --> 11:17.995
God.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.513
God, you are a tonic.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.238
What do you do?
Are you a "woman in business"?

11:23.360 --> 11:24.760
I run a cafÃ©.
- Oh.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.400
Oh, good for you.

11:27.680 --> 11:28.955
Did you make the canapÃ©s?

11:29.480 --> 11:31.790
Uh, no, actually, I stole them.

11:34.440 --> 11:35.440
How old are you?

11:35.480 --> 11:37.233
Fifty-eight, and you?
- Thirty-three.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.875
Oh. Well, don't worry.
It does get better.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.471
You promise?
- I promise.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.352
Listen, I was in an aeroplane
the other day

11:46.480 --> 11:49.075
and I realised... well, I-I mean

11:49.160 --> 11:51.072
I've been longing to say this
out loud, so...

11:52.560 --> 11:56.474
Women are born with pain built in.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.920
It's our physical destiny.

11:59.160 --> 12:03.120
Uh, period pains, sore boobs,
childbirth, you know.

12:04.440 --> 12:07.672
We carry it within ourselves
throughout our lives.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.160
Men don't.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.715
They have to seek it out.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.911
They invent all these gods
and demons and things

12:13.000 --> 12:14.719
all so they can feel guilty
about things

12:14.800 --> 12:17.520
which is something we do
very well on our own.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.917
And then they create wars
so they can

12:20.280 --> 12:21.999
feel things and touch each other

12:22.120 --> 12:24.096
and when there aren't any wars,
they can play rugby.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.830
And we have it all going on
in here, inside.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.750
We have pain on a cycle
for years and years and years.

12:31.840 --> 12:36.551
And then, just when you feel you
are making peace with it all, what happens?

12:37.480 --> 12:38.480
The menopause comes.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.638
The fucking menopause comes,
and it is...

12:43.880 --> 12:45.553
...the most

12:46.960 --> 12:49.759
wonderful fucking thing in the world.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.958
And yes, your entire pelvic floor crumbles

12:53.160 --> 12:55.470
and you get fucking hot,
and n-no one cares

12:55.800 --> 12:56.800
but then...

12:57.640 --> 12:58.640
you're free.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.400
No longer a slave

13:01.520 --> 13:04.319
no longer a-a machine with parts.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.958
You're just a person, in business.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.200
Oh.

13:11.560 --> 13:12.755
I was told it was horrendous.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.673
It is horrendous,
but then it's magnificent.

13:15.680 --> 13:16.840
Something to look forward to.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.720
You better get back
to that party.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.998
Your party.
- Mm. It is not a party

13:27.520 --> 13:28.795
until someone flirts with you.

13:28.880 --> 13:31.600
And that's the only really
shit thing about getting older

13:31.680 --> 13:34.036
is that people don't flirt
with you anymore.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.352
Not really. Not with danger.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.035
I miss walking into a room
and not knowing

13:39.240 --> 13:42.392
and there's a sort of energy,
a dare.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.871
And do not take that for granted.

13:46.800 --> 13:50.191
There is nothing more exciting
than a room full of people.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.400
Yeah, except most people are...

13:53.120 --> 13:54.120
What?

13:56.240 --> 13:57.240
Shit.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.520
Oh.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.280
Look at me.

14:01.280 --> 14:02.350
Listen.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.234
People are all we've got.

14:06.800 --> 14:10.237
People are all we've got,
so grab the night by its nipples

14:10.320 --> 14:12.039
and go and flirt with someone.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.155
Mm. No, that's not what I meant.

14:19.840 --> 14:20.990
Mm...

14:21.080 --> 14:23.959
Oh. I wish you were my type.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.910
You take this tart back to my party

14:28.000 --> 14:29.856
and go and find someone
to actually do that with.

14:29.880 --> 14:31.439
I want to do it with you.
- No.

14:31.920 --> 14:32.920
Why not?

14:32.960 --> 14:34.076
Honestly?
- Yeah.

14:34.760 --> 14:35.910
I can't be arsed, darling.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.510
I'm gonna go back to my room
and have one more martini

14:40.560 --> 14:41.880
and if you need anything

14:42.480 --> 14:43.439
call me.

14:43.440 --> 14:44.440
Anything.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.715
You can have whoever you want
at your age.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.200
Except the Best Woman in Business.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.313
Well, that's just cos she's... exhausted.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.709
33 isn't exactly...

14:55.800 --> 14:57.871
And what had Jesus done by 33?

14:58.240 --> 14:59.119
Died?

14:59.120 --> 15:01.271
Exactly. So get out there and flirt.

15:11.760 --> 15:12.760
Here you are.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.031
Oh, hi.
- Thought you might be snogging Finland.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.639
Ha. No, I, uh...

15:16.720 --> 15:18.154
Just, uh, sorting a few things.

15:18.440 --> 15:19.840
I got her.
- Oh.

15:20.160 --> 15:23.039
And Belinda gave me her card.
- Oh, that's great.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.675
What?
- Nothing.

15:26.560 --> 15:27.560
She's furious.

15:28.120 --> 15:29.520
Really?
- Yes.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.790
It was a great night.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.639
Everything went smoothly
in the end

15:32.720 --> 15:34.677
and everyone loved the canapÃ©s.

15:34.840 --> 15:35.956
Really?
I'm a dead woman.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.639
Really?
- Yes.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.200
Really?

15:39.320 --> 15:40.879
Yes. It was a great night.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.880
She's gonna blow.
I just have a feeling...

15:42.960 --> 15:44.758
I would have come up
with my own joke

15:44.880 --> 15:46.473
if you hadn't put that one
in my head.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.712
I have my own jokes.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.156
I am funny, I am interesting.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.392
I knew I shouldn't have
brought you here.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.136
What do you mean "interesting"?
- You just think you can do

15:55.160 --> 15:57.391
whatever you like,
say whatever you like

15:57.760 --> 15:59.831
steal whatever you like,
kiss whoever you like.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.877
He kissed me!
- Oh, I know!

16:02.920 --> 16:03.956
You know?

16:04.440 --> 16:06.336
Then why have we been spending the entire...
- Because you're fine.

16:06.360 --> 16:09.000
You'll always be fine,
you'll always be interesting

16:09.080 --> 16:11.800
with your quirky cafÃ©
and your dead best friend.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.998
You just make me feel
like I've failed.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.359
Claire...

16:18.360 --> 16:21.239
If you mention the size
of my office, I will scream.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.756
It's huge.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.234
I just thought
we were hanging out.

16:31.800 --> 16:32.836
Just as friends.

16:34.440 --> 16:35.476
We're not friends.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.235
We are sisters.

16:39.840 --> 16:40.956
Get your own friends.

17:01.440 --> 17:03.193
Oh, hi.
- Oh, sorry.

17:03.720 --> 17:04.935
I didn't have your number,
and you just said

17:04.960 --> 17:06.280
come round anytime with G&Ts.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.398
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
I just, uh...

17:09.040 --> 17:10.935
This is a bit embarrassing,
but recently I've been

17:10.960 --> 17:13.474
really enjoying
going to bed at 9:30.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.200
Oh, shit.
- No, it's fine.

17:15.560 --> 17:16.789
I can see G&T...
Are you OK?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.640
Yeah, yeah, I just-just fancied
a drink and a priest

17:19.720 --> 17:20.836
and a chat, maybe.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.349
Oh, that's my whole job.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.136
We'll have to be quiet though

17:24.160 --> 17:25.160
because Pam's a bit of a

17:25.240 --> 17:27.471
sound tyrant in the evenings.

17:27.599 --> 17:28.600
Pam lives here?

17:28.720 --> 17:30.074
Yeah, Pam lives here.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.031
- So, I read your book.
- OK, great.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.680
Well, it's got some great twists.
- True.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.439
Uh, but I just, I couldn't help

17:39.520 --> 17:40.576
but notice...
- Come on, just spit it out.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.637
...just one or two
little inconsistencies.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.880
OK, sure.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.878
So, the world was made
in seven days

17:46.400 --> 17:48.073
and on the first day,
light came

17:48.160 --> 17:50.720
and then, a few days later,
the sun came.

17:52.600 --> 17:53.636
Yeah, that's ridiculous.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.439
But you believe that.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.593
But it's not fact.
It's poetry, it's moral code.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.479
It's for interpretation
to help us work out

18:00.600 --> 18:01.875
God's plan for us.

18:02.800 --> 18:03.916
What's God's plan for you?

18:04.440 --> 18:07.160
I believe God meant for me
to love people

18:07.840 --> 18:09.433
in a... different way.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.910
I believe I'm supposed
to love people as a father.

18:12.960 --> 18:13.960
We can arrange that.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.078
A father of many.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.080
I'll go up to three.
- It's not gonna happen.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.634
Two, then.
- OK, two.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.474
Oh, shit, Pam.
She's not happy.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.074
We should go outside.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.256
Do you think I should become a Catholic?

18:32.280 --> 18:33.350
No, don't do that.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.870
I like that you believe
in a meaningless existence.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.237
And you're good for me, you make me

18:38.600 --> 18:39.670
question my faith.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.312
And?
- I've never felt closer to God.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.279
Fuck you.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.800
What was that?

18:46.240 --> 18:47.736
It wasn't a fox, was it?
- I don't know.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.877
Was it a fox?
Shine something. Boo! Baa!

18:50.080 --> 18:52.000
- Oh, God, I bet it's a fox.
- Oh, God.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.549
No, I'm not being funny,
foxes have been after me for years.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.240
It's like they have a pact or something.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.596
I'm not kidding. I was on a toilet

18:58.680 --> 19:00.672
a toilet of a train,
and when the train stopped

19:00.760 --> 19:02.256
a fucking fox tried
to get through the window.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.556
Of a train!
Its face was in the window.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.911
And once,
when I was at a monastery

19:07.280 --> 19:08.536
I woke up just feeling a bit weird

19:08.560 --> 19:10.870
like there might be a fox about,
and a fox was sitting

19:10.960 --> 19:13.429
underneath my window,
looking at me like this.

19:13.960 --> 19:16.600
Pointing at me like,
"You... we're watching you.

19:16.800 --> 19:17.800
We're having you."

19:20.680 --> 19:21.830
Lucky God got there first.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.157
Well, yeah.
- You could be a fox boy by now.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.280
And we all know what happened to them.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.875
You OK?
- I'm OK.

19:33.320 --> 19:34.356
Do you think I'm mad?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.760
Because of the fox thing
or cos of the God thing?

19:37.040 --> 19:38.713
You're obsessed.

19:40.800 --> 19:41.800
Do you ever have doubts?

19:42.880 --> 19:45.554
Yes, of course. Every day.
It's part of the deal.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.160
I just don't think
I could do it.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.480
Especially as a...

19:53.720 --> 19:54.720
What?

19:55.240 --> 19:56.469
Celibacy and...

19:56.560 --> 19:57.560
Oh, it's a fucking fox!

19:57.640 --> 19:58.790
Chill out about the fox.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.759
Oh, sorry. I just don't know
what they want from me.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.116
Sorry.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.280
Celibacy.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.640
Go.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.040
I just...

20:12.520 --> 20:14.273
I couldn't give up sex forever.

20:15.800 --> 20:16.836
It's just too...

20:18.320 --> 20:19.320
too...

20:20.880 --> 20:21.880
Celibacy...

20:22.760 --> 20:25.116
is a lot less complicated than...

20:26.040 --> 20:27.360
romantic relationships.

20:28.280 --> 20:29.714
What if you meet
someone you like?

20:31.120 --> 20:34.033
I talk and drink and laugh
and give them Bibles

20:34.120 --> 20:35.793
and hope they eventually
leave me alone.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.480
What if you meet
someone you love?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.350
We're not gonna have sex.

20:47.760 --> 20:51.720
I know that's what you think
you want from me, but it's not.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.031
It won't bring any good.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.193
- Well, it might.
- It won't.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.760
I've been there many times...

21:00.680 --> 21:01.796
before I found this.

21:01.920 --> 21:02.990
Many, many times.

21:03.720 --> 21:04.790
How many times?

21:09.640 --> 21:10.676
Many.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.598
I'd really like to be your friend, though.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.000
I'd like to be your friend, too.

21:28.680 --> 21:29.680
We'll last a week.

21:31.600 --> 21:32.600
What was that?

21:34.840 --> 21:35.876
What?

21:36.600 --> 21:38.159
Where'd you...
where'd you just go?

21:39.320 --> 21:40.320
What?

21:41.120 --> 21:43.191
You just... went somewhere.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.120
There. There.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.440
Where'd you just go?

21:51.640 --> 21:52.640
Nowhere.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.310
OK.
