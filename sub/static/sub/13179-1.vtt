NURSE 1: Here it is.

15:06.646 --> 15:08.477
NURSE 2: And who is that? Is
that Baker's file or Larson?

15:08.548 --> 15:09.776
NURSE 1: That's Baker.

15:09.849 --> 15:11.714

15:11.784 --> 15:13.183

every piece of paper you have on
the case of Mrs. Christine Collins,

15:16.456 --> 15:18.447
and I want to see it right
now, do you understand me?

15:18.524 --> 15:21.152
Every piece. When
will she be coming out?

15:46.486 --> 15:48.579
Mrs. Collins,
I'm so sorry.

15:49.622 --> 15:51.817
(CRYING)

15:53.025 --> 15:55.289
Captain, your handling of
the Christine Collins case

15:55.361 --> 15:58.421
has exposed this department
to public ridicule.

15:59.031 --> 16:02.831
There is even the possibility
of civil and criminal liability.

16:03.302 --> 16:06.169
Sir, nobody could've known what
was happening up at that ranch.

16:06.239 --> 16:09.299
Not us, the sheriff's department,
or the marshal's office.

16:09.375 --> 16:11.468
And as for the
Collins woman,

16:11.544 --> 16:14.308
I'm still not convinced that her boy
is among the victims up in Wineville.

16:14.447 --> 16:15.539
No?

16:15.615 --> 16:16.582
No.

16:16.649 --> 16:20.141
There were four other photos of
missing boys that looked a lot like him.

16:20.219 --> 16:22.153
The Clark kid
could've been mistaken.

16:22.221 --> 16:23.552
Maybe he was.

16:23.623 --> 16:26.854
Which begs the obvious
question. Who cares?

16:28.261 --> 16:29.353
Sir?

16:29.595 --> 16:31.790
The mayor wants
this to go away.

16:31.864 --> 16:33.957
I want this to go away.

16:34.033 --> 16:37.525
The way you do that is to stop
insisting that Walter Collins

16:37.603 --> 16:40.128
is not among those boys killed
up at that goddamn ranch.

16:40.206 --> 16:42.766
Because if the boy you brought
back is not Walter Collins,

16:42.842 --> 16:45.834
and he's not dead up at that
ranch, then where the hell is he?

16:45.912 --> 16:47.607
People are gonna want to
know why we haven't found him.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.944
Why we're not
doing our job.

16:50.650 --> 16:52.743
But if, on the other hand,

16:52.819 --> 16:57.085
he is, or could be, among those
poor boys killed up in Wineville,

16:57.557 --> 16:59.889
then the inquiries stop.

17:01.627 --> 17:03.185
It's a momentary
embarrassment

17:03.262 --> 17:05.388
you're just gonna
have to live with.

17:05.464 --> 17:06.931
Better a short
inconvenience

17:06.999 --> 17:10.162
than a lingering problem,
wouldn't you say, Captain?

17:10.236 --> 17:11.396
Yes, sir.

17:11.470 --> 17:13.335
The boy's been gone
nearly a year.

17:13.406 --> 17:16.569
If he was going to be found,
it would've happened by now.

17:16.642 --> 17:18.007
Whether he was up
at that ranch or not,

17:18.077 --> 17:20.271
the truth is he probably
is dead somewhere.

17:20.346 --> 17:24.406
Better his mother accept that
now than later, don't you think?

17:24.483 --> 17:26.473
Yes, sir.
- Good.

17:26.551 --> 17:28.179
That'll be all, Captain.

17:29.889 --> 17:33.552
That's how you want it,
then I guess we're done here.

17:33.759 --> 17:35.420
Tell county jail we're
remanding him for trial.

17:35.494 --> 17:39.362
Wait. I didn't do anything. I
wasn't even here when it happened.

17:40.566 --> 17:41.897
By pretending to
be Walter Collins,

17:41.968 --> 17:45.460
you're interfering in a police
investigation of a kidnapping and murder.

17:45.538 --> 17:48.530
We can try you as accomplice
to that murder after the fact.

17:48.608 --> 17:50.041
That's too bad.

17:50.109 --> 17:53.840
County jail is a lot worse than
a juvenile hall or a foster home.

17:53.913 --> 17:55.312
It's a lot worse.

17:57.316 --> 17:59.807
You can't do that.
I'm just a kid.

18:02.321 --> 18:04.346
Sanford Clark's a kid, too.

18:04.423 --> 18:06.891
Fifteen.
He's going to jail.

18:06.959 --> 18:11.157
All murderers and their accomplices
go to jail. Everybody knows that.

18:13.332 --> 18:16.062
Get him out of here.
It's out of my hands now.

18:16.135 --> 18:18.660
Wait. I don't
want to go to jail.

18:26.412 --> 18:27.504
(EXHALES)

18:28.915 --> 18:30.177
Prove it.

18:31.851 --> 18:33.148
I...

18:33.286 --> 18:36.813
I knew Los Angeles is where
they make the Tom Mix movies.

18:37.490 --> 18:39.390
I figured
if I could meet Tom Mix

18:39.458 --> 18:42.154
maybe he would let me
ride on his horse.

18:43.696 --> 18:46.256
His horse is named Tony.
Did you know that?

18:50.569 --> 18:51.968
How are you feeling?

18:52.038 --> 18:53.403
CHRISTINE: All right.

18:54.140 --> 18:55.869
The police still
have a car outside.

18:55.942 --> 18:59.810
I guess they're waiting to see
what your next move is going to be.

19:00.947 --> 19:02.972
I'm going home.
- And then?

19:03.449 --> 19:05.383
Then, I've been giving it
a lot of thought.

19:05.451 --> 19:09.945
And what they did to those women,
and what they did about Walter.

19:10.823 --> 19:14.486
I used to always tell him, "You never
start a fight, but you always finish it."

19:14.560 --> 19:17.961
And I didn't start this
fight, but I'm gonna finish it.

19:18.564 --> 19:22.762
Mrs. Collins, right now you're a
sufficiently high profile that I think

19:22.835 --> 19:26.669
even the police would hesitate
to go after you out in the open,

19:27.139 --> 19:29.539
but I have to warn you that
could change very quickly

19:29.608 --> 19:32.304
if they feel their
position threatened.

19:32.378 --> 19:34.175
Very quickly indeed.

19:35.548 --> 19:37.880
What are they gonna
do to me now?

19:39.785 --> 19:41.412
They got nothing.

19:44.423 --> 19:45.947

Yeah, I got in
a couple of days ago,

20:18.624 --> 20:21.491
figured I'd surprise you.
Is that... Is that okay?

20:21.560 --> 20:24.586
Yes. Yes, of course.
Of course, come on in.

could stay on a couple days.

Staying?

20:40.212 --> 20:41.338
Yeah.

Listen, can I use
your bathroom?

20:43.749 --> 20:45.740

I could really use a shower.

to meet my friend, Mr. Hahn.

Mrs. Collins, my deepest
condolences on your loss.

21:34.934 --> 21:36.492
May we come in?

21:40.606 --> 21:42.506
I appreciate the sentiment,

21:42.575 --> 21:44.805
but they've yet to find...

21:44.877 --> 21:47.402
To identify the
remains as my son.

I'm afraid it never
gets any easier.

to polio five years ago.

when I don't think,

21:57.156 --> 21:59.681
"I should mention
this to Claudine."

21:59.758 --> 22:02.124
Then I remember
she's not here.

22:04.997 --> 22:06.294
Please, sit.

22:11.237 --> 22:13.171
I've been on the phone
all morning

22:13.239 --> 22:16.436
with the appointment secretary
of the police commission.

22:16.509 --> 22:18.477
They said that they
won't let me testify

22:18.544 --> 22:21.809
at the hearing or call witnesses.
That it won't be necessary.

22:21.881 --> 22:24.475
I know. My sources say
the police commission

22:24.550 --> 22:28.646
is going to say that Jones and the
LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong,

22:28.754 --> 22:31.814
and that the real blame lies
with the kid and with you

22:31.891 --> 22:36.828
for being difficult and forcing them
to put you away for your own safety.

22:40.166 --> 22:44.330
Then I guess I would have to
hire a lawyer, file a civil suit.

22:45.137 --> 22:47.071

city four times and won.

22:50.042 --> 22:53.011
Unfortunately, we can't
afford to really hire him.

I'm doing this pro bono.

the boy was not her son.

with the boy we found in DeKalb

31:09.708 --> 31:11.767

was something the matter with her?

chance to look through the files

to my son, Walter Collins.

43:45.229 --> 43:46.821

In fact, that's why
I wanted to see you.

We had a...

44:01.679 --> 44:04.443

a very strange telegram.

From who?

44:06.684 --> 44:08.652
Gordon Northcott.

44:08.719 --> 44:10.619
He's asked to see you.

44:11.155 --> 44:12.213
Why?

44:13.291 --> 44:15.225
He said he knows you're
still looking for your son,

44:15.293 --> 44:17.193
and before he dies...

44:20.665 --> 44:24.066
He says he lied when he testified
that he didn't kill Walter.

44:24.135 --> 44:27.730
Christine, he's willing to
finally admit that he did it.

44:28.573 --> 44:31.041
He says if you come up
to see him in person,

44:31.108 --> 44:33.633
then he'll tell you
the truth, to your face

44:33.711 --> 44:36.236
so that you can get
on with your life

Mr. Northcott, you
asked me to come here.

45:41.045 --> 45:42.740
You said that
if I did,

45:42.813 --> 45:45.509
you would tell me
the truth about my son.

45:46.817 --> 45:48.216

45:56.060 --> 45:59.496
I didn't really think
that you would come.

can't talk to you right now,

be doing to me tomorrow.

want to hear, Mrs. Collins.

and he did, so far as I know.

really good ever since.

<i>PRESENTER ON RADIO:</i>
...The Thin Man, Cleopatra...

54:52.663 --> 54:54.290
Overrated.

54:54.364 --> 54:56.423
<i>... and</i> It Happened One Night.

54:56.500 --> 54:58.434
Clark Gable,
Claudette Colbert.

54:58.502 --> 54:59.901
I rest my case.

54:59.970 --> 55:02.404
<i>May I have the</i>
<i>envelope, please?</i>

55:04.041 --> 55:07.772
<i>And the winner is</i>
It Happened One Night.

55:07.845 --> 55:09.574
(CHUCKLING)

55:09.646 --> 55:11.841
I knew it! I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it!

55:11.915 --> 55:13.849
(PHONE RINGING)

55:13.917 --> 55:15.544
Dinner is on me.

55:15.619 --> 55:17.484
<i>MRS. CLAY: Is this</i>
<i>Christine Collins?</i>

55:17.554 --> 55:19.715
(CLEARS THROAT)
Yes, it is.

55:19.790 --> 55:22.384
<i>This is Mrs. Clay.</i>
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

55:23.026 --> 55:25.324
(STAMMERING) Mrs. Clay,
of course I remember you.

55:25.395 --> 55:27.454
<i>I just had to</i>
<i>call you right off.</i>

55:27.531 --> 55:29.795
What is it?
<i>- The police just called.</i>

55:29.867 --> 55:32.062
<i>They found a boy,</i>
<i>Christine.</i>

55:33.871 --> 55:35.998
Where?
<i>- Lincoln Heights Precinct.</i>

55:36.073 --> 55:37.540
<i>We're leaving right now.</i>

55:37.608 --> 55:39.098
I'll be right down.

56:01.798 --> 56:03.095
Oh, here.

56:03.767 --> 56:05.132
I wanted to go
to him right off,

56:05.202 --> 56:08.330
but they said it was important
to talk to him alone first.

56:08.405 --> 56:10.532
Are they sure?
- They're sure.

56:10.607 --> 56:13.770
But, more important,
I'm sure.

56:13.844 --> 56:14.936
It's my boy, all right.

56:15.012 --> 56:16.843
(EXCLAIMS)
It's David.

56:16.914 --> 56:19.041
He's alive, Christine.

56:19.116 --> 56:20.515
They found him
up in Hesperia.

56:20.584 --> 56:23.576
(SHUSHING) <i>OFFICER: You were
walking home from school,</i>

56:23.654 --> 56:25.849
<i>and they told you they
needed help finding a dog.</i>

56:25.923 --> 56:27.185
<i>DAVID: Yeah.</i>

56:27.257 --> 56:30.317
<i>So, after you got in the
truck, what happened next?</i>

56:30.394 --> 56:32.692
<i>They drove me around</i>
<i>for a long time,</i>

56:32.763 --> 56:34.321
then we ended up
at this ranch.

56:34.464 --> 56:37.865
(DAVID GRUNTS) GORDON:
Come on. Come on, Davy.

56:37.935 --> 56:39.300
Davy! Come on.
DAVID: Get off me.

56:39.369 --> 56:40.563
Don't fight
this much. Hey!

56:40.637 --> 56:42.730
Were there other
boys there?

56:43.440 --> 56:45.908
<i>Yeah. Five, I think.</i>

56:47.477 --> 56:49.411
It was a long
time ago, though.

56:49.479 --> 56:51.777
Hello, boys.
This is Davy.

56:51.848 --> 56:53.213
I know you'll make
him feel... Hey!

56:53.283 --> 56:54.307
(BOYS SHOUTING)

56:54.384 --> 56:57.717
(SHOUTING) No. No! Hey! Shut up!

56:57.788 --> 56:59.688
Did you speak to them?

57:00.457 --> 57:03.051
Yeah? You remember
any of their names?

57:03.927 --> 57:05.895
Yeah.

57:05.963 --> 57:07.396
Two of them
were brothers.

57:07.464 --> 57:10.297
I think their last
name was Winslow.

57:11.602 --> 57:13.695
<i>The oldest one</i>
<i>was Jeffrey.</i>

57:17.674 --> 57:19.164
And Walter.

57:21.578 --> 57:23.102
<i>Walter?</i>

57:23.880 --> 57:26.781
Yeah.
- Do you remember Walter's last name?

57:32.222 --> 57:33.484
Collins.

57:35.158 --> 57:36.716
<i>Walter Collins.</i>

57:37.761 --> 57:40.992
Tell me something if you only
remember some of the boys' names,

57:41.064 --> 57:43.726
how come you remember
his full name?

57:44.468 --> 57:46.595
Because of
what happened.

57:46.670 --> 57:48.695
<i>Walter and Jeffrey</i>
<i>were talking.</i>

57:48.772 --> 57:50.706
JEFFREY: Pull it.
<i>DAVID: They kept checking around</i>

57:50.774 --> 57:53.368
and they found a part of the coop
where the wire was all messed up.

57:53.443 --> 57:55.035
WALTER: (WHISPERING)
Be careful!

57:55.112 --> 57:56.807
Hurry!

57:56.880 --> 57:59.246
Maybe make enough room to
get out of there and run.

57:59.316 --> 58:01.011
JEFFREY: When we get
out, we split up,

58:01.084 --> 58:02.847
go in different
directions. Okay?

58:02.919 --> 58:05.012
They can't catch all of us.

58:05.088 --> 58:07.056
It'd make an awful
lot of noise.

58:07.124 --> 58:09.854
JEFFREY: (WHISPERING)
Be quiet. You got it?

58:09.926 --> 58:12.827
And if it wasn't wide
enough, then we'd be stuck.

58:16.199 --> 58:19.396
DAVID: (GRUNTS) Wait.
Help! Help! Come on, hurry!

58:20.304 --> 58:23.603
My foot's stuck! Hurry,
help! Help me, please!

58:26.176 --> 58:29.043
He's coming!
He's...

58:29.112 --> 58:30.773
My foot!

58:31.715 --> 58:33.239
(WALTER GASPS)
DAVID: He's coming.

58:33.317 --> 58:35.080
Hurry, run, run, run!

58:40.190 --> 58:42.681
GORDON: Hey! What
the hell are you boys...

58:44.561 --> 58:49.191
Oh! Mary, Mother of
God! Hey! Hey! Hey!

58:49.933 --> 58:52.993
You get back here!
Hey! Hold it! Hey!

58:54.338 --> 58:55.396
(GUN COCKING)

58:55.472 --> 58:56.564
Hey!

58:56.640 --> 58:57.664
(GUN FIRING)

58:57.741 --> 58:58.799
(BOYS GRUNTING)
GORDON: Hey!

58:58.875 --> 58:59.933
(DAVID YELLS)

59:00.010 --> 59:01.637
(GUN FIRING)
SANFORD: Stop!

59:02.879 --> 59:03.903
(YELLS)

59:03.980 --> 59:05.345
Check on the others!

59:05.415 --> 59:06.814
Stop! Damn it!

59:06.883 --> 59:09.147
Boys,
I'm coming after you!

59:09.219 --> 59:12.313
Damn it! Damn it!

59:12.622 --> 59:15.557
Boys, I'll find you no
matter where you are!

59:15.625 --> 59:17.991
SANFORD: They're not in there!
- Come on! Get in the car!

59:18.061 --> 59:22.191
I'm gonna find you! Damn
it! Damn it! Come on.

59:22.265 --> 59:24.665
Shit! Get in
the car, Sanford!

59:27.304 --> 59:28.635
(PANTING)

59:32.142 --> 59:34.770
That was the last
I saw of any of them.

59:35.345 --> 59:38.371
So, you don't know if either
of the other two were captured?

59:38.448 --> 59:39.540
No.

59:40.817 --> 59:42.717
All I know is,

59:42.786 --> 59:45.653
if Walter hadn't
come back for me

59:46.523 --> 59:49.253
<i>I don't think I ever would've
gotten out of there.</i>

59:50.160 --> 59:51.525
Okay.

59:52.796 --> 59:54.957
So, what happened
after that?

59:55.031 --> 59:56.726
I kept off
the main roads,

59:56.800 --> 01:00:01.760
until I saw a train stopped
at a crossing and I jumped in.

01:00:02.172 --> 01:00:05.232
Why didn't you tell
anyone what had happened?

01:00:05.308 --> 01:00:06.775
I was afraid.

01:00:07.277 --> 01:00:10.246
I thought they'd come
after me, or my folks.

01:00:12.048 --> 01:00:14.482
<i>So, I just didn't</i>
<i>tell anybody.</i>

01:00:16.353 --> 01:00:20.551
I was on my own until I got a free
meal from this lady, Miss Lansing.

01:00:20.624 --> 01:00:23.115
Told her I was an
orphan, on my own.

01:00:25.095 --> 01:00:27.086
She said I could stay on.

01:00:28.532 --> 01:00:29.863
And I did.

01:00:31.101 --> 01:00:32.466
<i>Every night,</i>

01:00:32.536 --> 01:00:35.972
I'd wake up thinking they
were right outside my window.

01:00:36.506 --> 01:00:38.974
And then I heard the
police talking on the radio

01:00:39.042 --> 01:00:41.806
about what happened
at the ranch.

01:00:41.912 --> 01:00:44.278
And I thought, "For sure
I can't go back now."

01:00:44.347 --> 01:00:45.814
(SOFTLY) Why?

01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:47.407
Why not?

01:00:47.484 --> 01:00:50.282
Since I didn't tell
anybody what happened.

01:00:51.655 --> 01:00:54.419
I was afraid they'd blame
me for those kids being dead.

01:00:54.491 --> 01:00:55.788
(SNIFFLES)

01:00:56.326 --> 01:00:58.191
So I just stayed away.

01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:02.922
What made you come forward
now, after all this time?

01:01:02.999 --> 01:01:05.559
Hmm? Why come
forward now?

01:01:09.139 --> 01:01:10.902
I really miss my mom.

01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:15.210
I really miss my dad.

01:01:18.248 --> 01:01:20.216
I just wanna go home.

01:01:20.517 --> 01:01:21.916
<i>(DAVID SOBBING)</i>

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.417
<i>I just wanna go home.</i>

01:01:26.323 --> 01:01:27.347
(DOOR OPENING)

01:01:27.424 --> 01:01:30.291
(MRS. CLAY SOBBING)

01:01:31.428 --> 01:01:33.191
(CRYING) Are you all right?

01:01:33.864 --> 01:01:36.059
I love you.

01:02:08.565 --> 01:02:10.328
I still can't believe it.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.302
Five years, case closed, everyone
thinks he's dead, and there he is.

01:02:15.805 --> 01:02:18.569
Wouldn't be, if it
wasn't for Walter.

01:02:20.243 --> 01:02:22.803
Your son did a brave
thing, Mrs. Collins.

01:02:22.879 --> 01:02:25.074
You should be
very proud of him.

01:02:25.148 --> 01:02:26.479
I am.

01:02:28.818 --> 01:02:30.376
You still think
he's out there?

01:02:30.453 --> 01:02:31.681
Why not?

01:02:32.923 --> 01:02:34.891
Three boys made a run for
it that night, Detective.

01:02:34.958 --> 01:02:36.482
And if one got out,

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.654
then maybe either or both
of the others did, too.

01:02:39.729 --> 01:02:43.290
Maybe Walter's out there, having
the same fears that he did.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.265
Afraid to come home
and identify himself,

01:02:45.335 --> 01:02:47.735
or afraid he'll get
into trouble.

01:02:49.172 --> 01:02:51.265
But either way,

01:02:51.341 --> 01:02:54.469
it gives me something I
didn't have before tonight.

01:02:54.578 --> 01:02:55.977
What's that?

01:02:56.947 --> 01:02:58.141
Hope.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.998
