WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.461
ADAMA: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:04.088 --> 00:06.756
What about the FTL question?
It's possible.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.383
It's labor-intensive,
a lot of grunt work,

00:08.467 --> 00:10.760
but we should be able to
upgrade all the Jump drives

00:10.844 --> 00:13.221
in the entire Fleet
with Cylon technology.

00:13.889 --> 00:15.515
It's not gonna be easy to
sell the Quorum on this one.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.642
The question has been called.
All in favor?

00:17.726 --> 00:18.893
All opposed?

00:18.977 --> 00:20.603
The vote is eleven-to-one.
Motion carries.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.647
No Cylon will board
a ship in this Fleet

00:22.731 --> 00:24.649
without permission
of its people.

00:25.609 --> 00:28.611
Ten of our ships refuse a
direct order from the flagship.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.072
Another 12 won't even
respond to our hails.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.490
They're not doing
anything illegal.

00:32.574 --> 00:35.201
Jump drive upgrades is
a military decision.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.578
And you alone get to
make that determination?

00:37.663 --> 00:38.913
Yes, Mr. Gaeta.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.623
You have a problem with that?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.750
Sir, the tylium ship's
pulling out of formation

00:42.835 --> 00:44.544
and spinning up
their FTL drives.

00:45.337 --> 00:46.587
Hitei Kan has
jumped away, sir.

00:46.672 --> 00:48.506
TIGH: Taking all
our fuel with them.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.719
You think I know
where the tylium ship is.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.387
I know that you do.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.015
ATHENA: Hitei Kan,
this is Athena.

00:58.142 --> 00:59.976
Stand by to be boarded.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.520
The world is frakked.
It's upside down

01:02.604 --> 01:04.105
and somebody's gotta turn it
right side up.

01:04.189 --> 01:05.523
Are you that man?

01:05.649 --> 01:08.484
I'm one of them.
I need a partner.

01:09.111 --> 01:10.528
You've got one.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.657
ZAREK: Every revolution
begins with one small act.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.409
Somebody close that hatch.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.660
Let's talk.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.512
It's fresh. You want a cup?

01:36.597 --> 01:40.308
Ever since they started grinding it
out of algae, I've lost the taste.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.978
We've got three more civilian
captains pitching fits,

01:44.062 --> 01:47.315
refusing to allow the
Cylon engineers on board.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.609
I thought we settled that
a couple of days ago.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.319
Tylium ship didn't
get the message.

01:51.403 --> 01:54.113
They're screaming bloody
murder to anyone who'll listen,

01:54.198 --> 01:58.993
claiming that they're being
illegally seized by our marines.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.870
I'm tired of this.

02:01.705 --> 02:02.914
Go to Lee.

02:02.998 --> 02:05.625
Tell the Quorum that if they
don't get their ships in line,

02:05.709 --> 02:08.127
they can all share
a blanket in Zarek's cell.

02:08.212 --> 02:09.879
I'll make the call, but...

02:10.047 --> 02:11.714
Mmm. Smells good.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.634
Hello, Colonel.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.594
ADAMA: Good morning.
Madam President.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.262
ROSLIN: How's it going?

02:21.391 --> 02:23.351
You were saying, Saul?

02:24.853 --> 02:27.897
(STAMMERING) It's just...

02:28.982 --> 02:33.110
Given the Fleet's mood
toward Cylons,

02:35.113 --> 02:38.783
you might not want me
taking point on this.

02:39.743 --> 02:40.910
I'll be up there in a minute.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.286
Yeah.

02:54.216 --> 02:56.092
Mr. Vice President.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.516
Rumors are already starting to spread.
Good luck keeping a lid on them.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.811
Believe me, the Fleet's
the least of our worries.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.032
You're clear, sir.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.702
And Connor called in. We're good
to go at the small arms locker.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.203
C deck?
Narcho and Private Paley.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.080
They're all over it.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.457
(GRUNTS)

03:30.294 --> 03:32.044
Move out, Corporal.

03:34.298 --> 03:36.382
Our biggest problem's
still the Quorum.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.259
Isolate them
for a few hours, but...

03:38.343 --> 03:39.886
They'll huff and puff,

03:39.970 --> 03:43.890
but reality will trump their sense of
duty soon enough. With one exception.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.099
We've been through this.

03:45.183 --> 03:48.227
He's a wild card. We're
talking about the Admiral's son.

03:49.313 --> 03:52.315
Push his buttons.
I hear you're good at that.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.444
The Colonel's right,
you know.

03:57.195 --> 04:01.866
The Fleet has never been comfortable
with this "blanket Cylon amnesty" thing.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.827
This coffee is terrible.

04:05.203 --> 04:08.456
Siccing Lee on the Quorum is only going
to be seen as a shot across the bow.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.708
He can hedge it all he wants,
but the delegates will see that

04:10.792 --> 04:12.251
it comes straight from you.

04:12.336 --> 04:13.502
He can handle it.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.838
Yes, he can. And so can you.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.674
And I'm not getting involved.

04:19.176 --> 04:23.137
Lee can take care of himself and
you can take care of yourself.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.973
And I am not getting
pulled back in.

04:30.687 --> 04:31.687
Yeah.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.191
The legendary Adama silence.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.567
I can see right through it.

04:36.652 --> 04:41.948
This passive-aggressive pretense that
you're okay if I don't get involved.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.700
I don't do passive-aggressive.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.995
Yes, you do. You just don't
know that's what it is.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.413
(LAUGHS)

04:50.958 --> 04:55.211
Well, get some rest.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.629
Rest.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.339
I'll try to make it home
for supper.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.216
I'll have it ready.

05:00.968 --> 05:01.968
(CHUCKLES)

05:03.971 --> 05:07.431
Cantrell's the key. Tell Lee
if he can get to Cantrell...

05:10.352 --> 05:11.602
I'm not.

05:28.704 --> 05:29.704
(TOOL CLANKS)

05:29.788 --> 05:32.540
Son of a bitch!
I got a fuel leak over here!

05:32.624 --> 05:34.291
Frakking spark could
blow the whole place.

05:34.376 --> 05:37.753
Hey, you guys, I need all of
you to clear the deck, now!

05:39.256 --> 05:40.548
Now!

05:48.348 --> 05:49.598
Sitrep, Lieutenant.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.685
Raptor's transponder's down for the
count, and LSO's good to go, sir.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.521
What the hell? What are
you... What are you doing?

05:55.605 --> 05:57.857
This ship's on hold for an
emergency medical transport,

05:57.941 --> 06:00.234
not some bogus VIP shuttle.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.194
Sorry, Chief, I assumed
the LSO called it in.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.904
This bird's been
cleared for launch ASAP.

06:03.989 --> 06:05.364
No, I didn't get the order.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.033
GAETA: Our new mission
takes priority.

06:07.117 --> 06:11.328
The Admiral believes that Zarek may have
an attempt on his life here on Galactica.

06:11.413 --> 06:14.081
Given the Vice President's
controversial status,

06:14.166 --> 06:16.250
he's being transferred
to Colonial One.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.543
All right.

06:17.627 --> 06:20.129
As soon as I confirm it
with CIC.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.964
Uh... You have confirmation.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.507
Laird.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.802
The Admiral doesn't
want this leaking out.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.638
Well, I'm sorry,
I can't take your word for it.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.816
MAN: Good riddance.
Frakker's been up Adama's ass

06:40.901 --> 06:43.527
since he transferred him
from Pegasus.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.119
(GRUNTS)

06:52.704 --> 06:54.163
He won't be the last.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.790
Get on that ship.
Not yet.

06:55.874 --> 06:56.957
Damn it, I need you...

06:57.042 --> 06:58.250
I know what you need.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.753
I also know a little
about revolution, Mr. Gaeta.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.256
Success doesn't hinge on some grand,
operatic idea or the "will of the people. "

07:04.341 --> 07:06.926
It hangs in the cumulative moments,
each one building on the next.

07:07.010 --> 07:10.137
And it can be lost
with the slightest hesitation.

07:10.222 --> 07:12.973
I started this and
I'll see it through.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.434
Now get on that
frakking ship.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.369
(THEME MUSIC)

08:20.876 --> 08:22.668
Colonel Tigh, sitrep.

08:22.961 --> 08:26.964
CAP is out and dradis
shows no enemy contacts.

08:27.090 --> 08:31.093
Fleet's still jacked up
on Zarek's anti-Cylon bull.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.179
Lee's giving the Quorum
a shove,

08:33.263 --> 08:37.975
but it'd take a cavity search to
find the backbone in that sorry bunch.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.643
(BEEPING)

08:41.897 --> 08:45.357
Felix. I'm showing a launch, but we don't
have anything listed in the flight log.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.277
Laird probably rescheduled it and
it didn't make it into the system.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.196
See if you can
find the update.

08:55.702 --> 08:59.288
I've got Nowart rounding up every
marine that can still pull a trigger.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.041
So, if you get fed up playing
chicken with these bastards,

09:02.125 --> 09:03.626
say the word.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.502
Hitei Kan was a special case.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.963
If we have to shoot up
every ship we go into,

09:08.089 --> 09:10.466
you can kiss this
alliance goodbye.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.012
Nothing. I better call down
to the deck, just to make sure.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.722
Hold up. Hold up.
Is that your launch?

09:16.848 --> 09:18.515
Because I'm not
seeing a squawk code.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.184
Is there a problem?

09:20.268 --> 09:22.436
We've got an unidentified
contact off the flight deck.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.064
No transponder ID,
I'm thinking dradis ghost.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.523
Last thing I need.

09:26.608 --> 09:30.694
Four years without a pit stop,
equipment's sketchy as hell.

09:30.820 --> 09:34.573
Mr. Gaeta. Order a full
diagnostic on dradis.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.033
Yes, sir. Right away.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.660
(ALL CLAMORING)

(GAVEL POUNDING)

09:39.746 --> 09:41.580
Order! Order!

09:44.167 --> 09:47.544
I remind you once again that
Mr. Zarek was taken into custody

09:47.629 --> 09:51.257
because he was agitating
against a lawful order.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.927
Now these Cylon FTL
drives are essential

09:55.011 --> 09:57.513
if the Fleet is
going to move on.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.063
Mr. Vice President.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.232
Don't look so surprised, Lee.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.777
Even your father knows when
he's holding a losing hand.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.362
I'll take it.

10:27.836 --> 10:28.961
(CHUCKLES)

10:30.088 --> 10:32.298
Yeah, I used to be
pretty good at this game.

10:32.382 --> 10:33.632
Oh, yeah?

10:35.468 --> 10:39.221
Making the shot,
winning the big game.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.557
Can't believe that used to
matter to me.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.603
Yeah, that life
back in the Colonies.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.273
It's like a dream to me now.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.152
And the further
away we get...

10:55.113 --> 10:56.155

10:56.239 --> 10:59.867
Gods, I remember
you and me back at Joe's Bar,

10:59.951 --> 11:02.745
slamming drinks,
shooting pyramid.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.497
(CHUCKLES) Those were
good times.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.085
They were, weren't they?
Mmm-hmm.

11:11.921 --> 11:15.257
I really thought there was
something between us, you know?

11:15.342 --> 11:18.510
When that didn't happen,
I wondered, was it me?

11:19.137 --> 11:20.846
No, Diana, I was...

11:20.972 --> 11:22.681
But now, I'm thinking no.

11:23.308 --> 11:28.896
Maybe it was something else, some
Cylon thing, your programming.

11:29.647 --> 11:32.274

but I just can't let it go.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.271
Admiral, I'm getting
a fire warning on Deck C,

12:11.356 --> 12:12.898
near the main antenna array.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.567
Order the damage control team
to C deck,

12:15.652 --> 12:18.153
have them report back to me
with their assessment ASAP.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.530
Yes, sir.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.908
Admiral, if the wireless array
goes down,

12:22.992 --> 12:25.494
we could lose communications
across the Fleet.

12:25.578 --> 12:29.832
Given our current situation, I'm thinking
this fire might not be an accident.

12:29.999 --> 12:33.836
Zarek's true believers would
have a field day if we went dark.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.339
Very well.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.968
Have the marine fire unit
accompany the DC party

12:41.052 --> 12:44.096
and prepare an evacuation
of all personnel from C deck.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.472

There had to have been other conquests
for the great Brendan Constanza.

in charge of damage control?

and get up to the hangar deck.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.296
You, take those
four people on D deck.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.883
Anybody asks any questions, you tell
them it's routine, Admiral's orders.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.024
GAETA OVER PHONE: Gaeta, CIC.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.817
This is Starbuck.
Give me the Admiral, now.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.152
He's busy, Captain.

14:22.237 --> 14:25.656
Gods damn it, we've got civilians
arming themselves down here.

14:27.784 --> 14:28.951
Gaeta!

14:42.215 --> 14:43.507
GAETA: Gaeta, CIC.

14:43.591 --> 14:44.716
This is Lee Adama.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.051
Get my father on the line.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.554
I'm sorry, Lee, we're having a
bit of an emergency right now.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.180
APOLLO: Is it serious?

14:50.598 --> 14:53.976
Nothing damage control can't
handle, but you know the Admiral.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.227
Yeah, well, I thought I did.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.395
Well, maybe you can help.

14:56.479 --> 14:59.064
Do you have any idea
why Tom Zarek was released?

14:59.148 --> 15:01.066
Released? When?

15:01.150 --> 15:02.526
Oh, that's just perfect.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.278
First he tells me to threaten
the delegates with jail,

15:04.362 --> 15:06.613
then blindsides me by
giving Zarek a pass.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.407
Doesn't make
sense to me, either.

15:08.491 --> 15:12.286
As soon as your father gets back,
I'll be sure that he knows you called.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.251
Problems on the home front?

15:20.670 --> 15:24.506
Have to say, Lee, you don't seem
particularly happy to see me.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.676
I'm glad you're out.

15:28.845 --> 15:32.014
My father overreached
when he had you arrested.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.850
But I hope you've changed
your mind about the Cylon FTLs.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.852
We need those drives.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.729
At least the Admiral
thinks we do.

15:38.813 --> 15:41.940
The problem with you, Lee, is that
you're trying to have it both ways.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.359
Honor thy father,
be true to your oath

15:44.444 --> 15:47.112
as the Caprican
Representative.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.865
At some point,
the two don't mix.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.492
Do you know why
he released me?

15:53.786 --> 15:57.748
Because I'm only a threat if he
recognizes civilian authority.

15:57.832 --> 16:01.168
I'm afraid our experiment
in democracy is about to end.

16:01.252 --> 16:04.379
Adama entertained it
until now because of Roslin,

16:04.464 --> 16:06.298
but since she abdicated
the throne...

16:06.382 --> 16:08.717
No. He wouldn't do that.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.262
Really?
Because he did it before.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.806
Tell me, what excuse
did he give this time

16:14.891 --> 16:17.059
when he refused
to take your call?

16:21.898 --> 16:23.315
You're leaving.
For Galactica.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.025
To prove you wrong.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.572
Sir, we just lost
communications, shipwide.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.907
Switch to secondaries.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.742
GAETA: They're a no-go.
Backups are down as well.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.035
And the fire seems
to be escalating,

16:35.119 --> 16:37.704
I'm seeing cascading system
failures across the board.

16:37.789 --> 16:41.333
Main antenna and backup,
both down at the same time?

16:41.417 --> 16:43.126
GAETA: With comms down,
the damage control team

16:43.211 --> 16:45.295
has no way of relaying
the status of the fire.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.886
MAN: Galactica, come in.
Galactica, come in.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.680
Galactica, do you read?

16:57.183 --> 16:59.893
Sir, are you trying to tell me that
all communications are still out?

16:59.977 --> 17:01.103
RACETRACK: Yeah.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.438

17:09.278 --> 17:11.780
Whatever this is about,
you're making a big mistake.

17:11.864 --> 17:16.618
Oh, sure. We're confused. Maybe we
should have a trial and sort it all out.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.038
After four years of fighting
with those Cylon things,

17:20.123 --> 17:23.250
did you really think you
could make a deal with them?

17:29.632 --> 17:31.675
So where are your
precious Cylons now?

who died once, it's no fun.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.149
Racetrack? Connor?

17:49.819 --> 17:51.153
Let him go.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.868
Kara, we need to get
the hell out of here.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.745
Kara, now.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.749

You're gonna be all right.
Frak!

18:12.133 --> 18:13.925
I know, it tastes
kind of yucky.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.595

I'm in the galley, okay?

Okay, easy, easy, easy.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.532

Remember me, big man?
From Pegasus?

18:44.040 --> 18:47.542
You and that toaster Tyrol
wasted my friend Thorne.

18:48.711 --> 18:49.836
Yeah.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.379
We didn't want
that to happen.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.633
You had a choice, but you backed
the skin job over your own kind.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.301
And to prove how
messed up it was,

18:56.385 --> 18:57.636
instead of showing you
the airlock,

18:57.720 --> 19:00.931
your Cylon-loving admiral
promoted you to CAG.

Frak you.

The way Connor was talking, they got
people ready to move on every deck.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.627
The hangar deck's
just a beachhead.

Right now, all we can
count on is you and me.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.370
Okay, CIC's protected.

He won't give up without
a fight. The President?

If the fire's compromised our sensors,
it's possible all our readings are suspect.

no way of verifying anything.

the thought that the Cylon race

can survive through natural

from a Cylon?

23:53.808 --> 23:57.560

under any circumstances.

26:24.667 --> 26:27.085
I have an idea about
the wireless. Let's go.

26:27.169 --> 26:29.254
Sir, intercom's up.

26:29.338 --> 26:32.590
I'm getting multiple reports
of gunfire near the engine room.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.509
Order Redwing to move
in with his marines.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.719
I want that area secured.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.721
(GUNSHOTS FIRING)

26:39.890 --> 26:41.516
Specialist Gage!

26:43.018 --> 26:44.519
Stay with us.

26:46.397 --> 26:47.981
Stack a heavy
pile right here.

26:48.065 --> 26:50.275
Stop them
coming in that door.

26:50.359 --> 26:51.693
Come on, people.
Faster's better.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.903
They could show up
at any time. Let's go.

26:55.197 --> 26:59.033
You understand, I have
no desire to leave you.

27:03.706 --> 27:05.039
No desire at all.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.625
But I have to go.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.627
If they're coming for anyone,
they're coming for me.

27:09.712 --> 27:10.795
And you'll all be safer.

27:10.879 --> 27:13.131
No, it's our fault, Gaius,
because we can't protect you.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.174
And I'm so sorry for that.

27:15.259 --> 27:17.135
Your transport
will be here soon.

27:17.219 --> 27:18.886
I want you to take this.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.264
And I want you to know
that we will pray for you,

27:21.348 --> 27:23.599
for your safe return. Okay?

27:26.186 --> 27:31.691
I'm deeply...
Right. Okay, okay.

27:32.234 --> 27:33.693
(EXHALES)

27:35.237 --> 27:37.989
Mr. Tyrol. Mr. Tyrol.

27:38.449 --> 27:42.160
You are absolutely certain
that it's imperative I leave?

27:42.244 --> 27:45.246
Look, I only know
what Jeanne saw.

27:45.331 --> 27:48.958
The hangar deck's gone, CIC weapons
are next and then nobody's safe.

27:49.043 --> 27:50.293
Hang on.
Right.

27:50.377 --> 27:52.211
So we should be getting
out of here soon... Go.

27:52.296 --> 27:55.923
...and getting hold of some
weapons maybe, because...

27:56.592 --> 28:00.011
Jeanne, I don't want the
statue, you can keep the statue.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.929
You keep the statue.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.477
Clear.

28:17.613 --> 28:18.571
APOLLO: Madam President, wait.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.281
No, it's all right.
They know who I am.

28:22.451 --> 28:24.410
I need to speak
to Dr. Baltar.

28:24.495 --> 28:25.995
No, you're not
welcome in here.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.955
Hey, I got this.
Go ahead.

28:28.957 --> 28:29.999
Go on.

28:30.084 --> 28:31.125
I need to see Baltar.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.211
There's something
you need to know.

28:33.295 --> 28:35.880
I got people all over the
ship giving me information.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.800
The Admiral was just
led away from the CIC.

28:39.301 --> 28:40.593
Where to?
No idea.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.178
My guess would be the brig.

28:42.262 --> 28:44.013
Don't trust the
ship's comm systems.

28:44.098 --> 28:45.390
We're using these.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.225
The hangar deck's
lost to us.

28:47.309 --> 28:49.936
If you can get your father to the
secondary storage bay within the hour,

28:50.020 --> 28:51.604
I'll get him off the ship.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.482
I'll handle
the Fleet. Go.

28:55.359 --> 28:58.820
Galen, why are
you doing this?

28:58.904 --> 29:02.156
The old man deserves a better
fate than what he'll get from them.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.826
Go find your father, Lee.

29:09.206 --> 29:10.665
ADAMA:
It's Nowart, isn't it?

29:11.500 --> 29:12.500
That's right, sir.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.044
I thought I remembered you. Marine.

29:15.671 --> 29:18.631
You put it on the line
when we took New Caprica.

29:18.715 --> 29:19.715
Got pretty hairy
down there, sir.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.801
Hey, screw the
war stories.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.178
I remember you,
too, Maldonaldo.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.889
Big mouth,
not much of a soldier.

29:26.974 --> 29:31.894
It doesn't matter, 'cause when this
is over, there's gonna be a reckoning.

29:31.979 --> 29:36.566
And live or die, it's how you
act today that's gonna matter.

29:37.025 --> 29:39.152
So what's it
gonna be, Nowart?

29:39.862 --> 29:40.820
Admiral,
don't do this.

29:40.904 --> 29:44.949
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let a
guy like you run me off my own ship.

29:45.742 --> 29:47.493
You want to shoot? Go on.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.245
Let's see if you got
a pair. I don't want...

29:49.329 --> 29:50.329
(GRUNTS)

29:53.667 --> 29:54.750
(SCREAMS)

29:55.502 --> 29:57.879
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29:58.172 --> 30:01.257
Put your hands behind your
back. You all right, Saul?

30:01.341 --> 30:02.592
I'll live.

30:02.676 --> 30:03.801
What about him?

30:03.886 --> 30:07.555
I think we'll
take him with us. Go.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.147
You going somewhere?

30:16.231 --> 30:17.732
Yes,
as a matter of fact I am.

30:19.610 --> 30:23.571
They consider it to be a
precautionary measure, sensible,

30:24.406 --> 30:26.115
given the delicate
nature of the Fleet.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.658
Very sensible,
considering the Fleet's

30:27.743 --> 30:30.286
tearing itself to
pieces right now.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.370
Have you come to pray?

30:31.455 --> 30:33.080
No, I have something
more tangible in mind.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.666
There is a chance that we
can avoid more bloodshed

30:35.751 --> 30:37.793
if I address the Fleet

30:37.878 --> 30:40.838
and reassure them
the Cylons mean no harm.

30:42.174 --> 30:46.010
While your faith in your
oratorical skills is impressive,

30:46.094 --> 30:47.803
and I'd love to help,
but, unfortunately,

30:47.888 --> 30:50.431
communication down here
is just as dodgy as...

30:50.516 --> 30:51.724
I know
you have a wireless.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.143
You've been using it
to communicate with your flock

30:54.228 --> 30:55.645
all these months.

30:55.729 --> 30:57.647
It's a trick, Gaius.

30:57.731 --> 30:59.273
I wish it were.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.650
She's afraid of
your teachings.

31:00.734 --> 31:02.443
She will take the wireless,
and she will silence you...

31:02.528 --> 31:04.487
All right,
okay, hold on.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.240
Thank you.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.331
She's got a point,
hasn't she?

31:15.415 --> 31:18.042
I mean, if you can
convince the Fleet,

31:18.919 --> 31:21.128
why can't you convince her?

31:21.213 --> 31:24.382
The thing is that I never really
believed in your conversion,

31:24.466 --> 31:28.469
so I was counting on your well-honed
sense of self-preservation.

31:30.264 --> 31:32.640
I'm so sick of
your insinuations.

31:33.934 --> 31:36.477
I recall your sudden allegiance
to the priestess Elosha

31:36.562 --> 31:38.229
and the scrolls of
Pythia the last time

31:38.313 --> 31:41.065
your political fortunes
were in doubt.

31:41.149 --> 31:45.486
Tell me, how is that
working out for you now?

31:46.238 --> 31:50.032
If it makes you happy,
maybe we're both frauds

31:50.117 --> 31:53.369
and this is our last
chance to atone that.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.999
Civilians are trying to
barricade the aft supply hold.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.083
I'm on it.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.586
Gaeta wants us to back up
Redwing in the engine room.

32:01.670 --> 32:04.046
They got four civvies down,
but there's still some holdouts,

32:04.131 --> 32:06.924
so we're gonna need
some more firepower.

32:10.721 --> 32:12.638
Where were you
taking us?

32:13.765 --> 32:15.016
The brig.

32:15.684 --> 32:17.810
Gaeta wants all essential
personnel and Cylons held...

32:17.894 --> 32:20.479
Might see some
friendly faces there.

32:20.564 --> 32:21.814
Get up.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.196
Sir, ships' captains are calling.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.406
They want to
know why Galactica's

32:30.490 --> 32:32.700
not responding
to their hails.

32:37.331 --> 32:39.790
Put them up on speaker.
All of it.

32:39.875 --> 32:42.209
And then get me a
scrambled line to Tom Zarek.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.586
MAN 1: We're unable
to reach Galactica.

32:43.670 --> 32:44.795
WOMAN 1: Admiral Adama, do you read?

32:44.880 --> 32:46.589
Are they going to
jump away like last time?

32:46.673 --> 32:47.798
MAN 2: Who's in charge of Galactica?

32:47.883 --> 32:49.008
MAN 1: Can't trust
Admiral Adama.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.469
MAN 2: Is any vessel in
communication with Colonial One?

32:51.553 --> 32:53.012
I have Colonial One.

32:54.139 --> 32:57.183
Mr. Zarek, I've taken
command of Galactica.

32:57.267 --> 32:59.310
The Admiral and his senior
staff are in custody.

32:59.394 --> 33:00.770
Adama's still alive?

33:00.854 --> 33:02.146
You sound disappointed.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.816
It's a loose end. I'm
sure you have your reasons.

33:05.901 --> 33:08.027
Still, congratulations
are in order.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.320
With the future of
the Fleet at stake,

33:09.404 --> 33:10.988
you've done a very
courageous thing.

33:11.073 --> 33:13.324
We can fine-tune our
rationalizations later.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.826
I'm still bringing
communications back online.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.119
And the Fleet's
in an uproar.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.371
Don't worry.
They'll fall in line.

33:18.455 --> 33:19.538
Especially after
I shower them...

33:19.623 --> 33:22.708
ROSLIN OVER PA: Women and men of
the Fleet, this is your President.

33:22.793 --> 33:23.834
What the frak?

33:23.919 --> 33:26.671
We have come to a crossroads
in our long and painful journey.

33:26.755 --> 33:27.755

33:28.965 --> 33:30.758
ROSLIN:
Of all the decisions...

33:30.842 --> 33:32.134
Where's this coming from?
I don't know.

33:32.219 --> 33:33.636
...since assuming
the Presidency,

33:33.720 --> 33:36.972
none was more frightening
or more difficult

33:37.057 --> 33:40.059
than agreeing to this
alliance with the Cylons.

33:42.688 --> 33:45.690
But we have come
to a crossroads

33:45.774 --> 33:48.567
in our long and
painful journey.

33:50.404 --> 33:53.197
Cylons and humans have
been at war for generations.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.032
We know nothing else.

33:55.117 --> 33:57.368
And we have been
locked in a struggle

33:57.452 --> 34:01.789
that has seen both sides
suffer unspeakable loss.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.457
But with our
supplies running low

34:03.542 --> 34:06.919
and our options limited,
our former enemies

34:07.003 --> 34:10.589
may represent our last,
perhaps our only hope.

and on Galactica...

34:13.218 --> 34:14.385

...who would reject this
alliance, I am asking you...

34:17.764 --> 34:18.973
Isolate the signal!

34:19.057 --> 34:20.141

34:21.810 --> 34:23.894

you to reconsider

34:23.979 --> 34:26.063
and place your trust
back in those

34:26.148 --> 34:29.567
who have brought you this far,
and to reject those traitors

34:29.651 --> 34:32.820
who would use
your fear of the Cylons

to destroy

Who would've thought?

36:03.495 --> 36:07.331
You probably knew him better
than anyone back on New Caprica.

36:07.916 --> 36:11.585
Well, obviously his loyalties
were divided even back then.

36:14.256 --> 36:15.923
Seems we both made
rather bad choices

a way off the ship?

I don't know, you tell me.

Now you want to know why Tom Zarek's
got so much clout in this fleet?

36:47.247 --> 36:49.164
Because when you get past
the arrogance, he's right.

36:49.249 --> 36:50.875

put it behind us,

36:50.959 --> 36:53.127

37:55.190 --> 37:57.399
Or whatever they're gonna call
it when this thing is through.

37:57.484 --> 37:59.485
I know you, Felix.

38:00.445 --> 38:03.822
I know you're a good man.
You're an honorable man.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.076
You want to do
the right thing.

38:07.160 --> 38:09.787
Even your failings
have been understandable.

38:09.871 --> 38:12.289
What, like serving in your
corrupt administration?

38:12.374 --> 38:14.208
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.960
Our little secret.

38:17.087 --> 38:19.463
Sealed with
a very special pen.

38:20.382 --> 38:23.676
But I forgive you for that,
Felix. I'm telling you,

38:24.386 --> 38:26.971
if you are hungry for
redemption, this is not the way.

38:27.055 --> 38:30.099
Goodbye, Gaius. Felix,
please, listen to me...

38:42.570 --> 38:44.279
What's Raptor
six-one-niner's mission?

38:44.364 --> 38:47.491
Transporting human crew
from the Cylon base ship.

38:47.575 --> 38:50.285
They should have
called the LSO by now.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.164
They're not headed
for the hangar deck.

39:11.891 --> 39:13.267
We're ready.

39:25.113 --> 39:27.489
ADAMA: It's good to
see you, Mr. Tyrol.

39:27.574 --> 39:30.159
Forgot this place
was down here.

39:30.243 --> 39:31.827
Yeah, everybody did.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.537
Got trashed during
the raid on New Caprica,

39:33.621 --> 39:35.456
but I brought it
back online for this.

40:03.818 --> 40:08.989
I came here because I don't
want you to worry about me.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.325
And I know what
you have to do.

40:15.371 --> 40:17.581
MAN: This is Sector 12, copy.

40:17.665 --> 40:18.665
Go.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.375
Marine fire team
just went past.

40:20.460 --> 40:22.044
Looks like they're
coming your way.

40:22.128 --> 40:23.212
You got about two minutes.

40:23.296 --> 40:26.507
Mr. Tyrol, take them back the way
we came. You go with them, Colonel.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.759
Come too far to walk
out on you now, Bill.

40:28.843 --> 40:29.927
What are you doing, sir?

40:30.011 --> 40:31.220
The Colonel and I
are gonna make sure

40:31.304 --> 40:34.223
that the President's Raptor
gets out of here safely.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.738
WOMAN:
Initiating launch sequence.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.368
Open it.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.872
BALTAR: Admiral,
Madam President, please.

41:01.543 --> 41:03.669
Let's move it.
Get it open.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.550
Prepare to launch.

41:36.119 --> 41:38.203
Raptor just took off
from an aft airlock.

41:38.288 --> 41:39.580
They're not
responding to my hails.

41:41.958 --> 41:43.167
Gage, who's on CAP?

41:43.251 --> 41:44.585
I got Hotdog, Narcho...

41:44.669 --> 41:46.003
Get me Narcho on a wireless.

41:46.087 --> 41:47.379
Scramble frequency.

41:47.463 --> 41:49.256
What are your orders?

41:59.767 --> 42:02.978
Arm all weapons. Engage
the target and destroy.

42:09.068 --> 42:11.945
You could have gone
over with her, Bill.

42:14.157 --> 42:16.408
I couldn't have
lived with it.

42:27.128 --> 42:28.879
Come on! Let's go!

42:33.843 --> 42:35.302
MARINE: Look out!

42:43.394 --> 42:46.813
It's been an honor to have
served with you, my friend.

42:51.027 --> 42:52.903
MARINE 1: All right, soldier.
MARINE 2: Move, move.

42:52.987 --> 42:54.404
Cover up.

42:56.616 --> 42:58.492
Fire in the hole!

43:10.171 --> 43:11.255
