01:32.634 --> 01:33.802
Mr. Hamilton.

01:33.843 --> 01:34.594
Yes.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.763
You have water in the door.

01:37.806 --> 01:38.556
Great.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.986
Straight to
the convention center?

01:52.404 --> 01:53.279
Absolutely.

02:09.888 --> 02:11.188
You're American.

02:11.190 --> 02:12.222
Mm-hm.

02:12.224 --> 02:13.557
Arkansas.

02:13.559 --> 02:15.192
Ah, Southern girl.

02:15.194 --> 02:16.893
Yes sir, I am.

02:16.895 --> 02:18.195
Call me Peter.

02:18.197 --> 02:20.264
Sir makes me feel like
I'm retiring to Florida.

02:20.266 --> 02:23.900
Oh, I'm so sorry about that.

02:23.902 --> 02:25.402
What's your name?

02:25.404 --> 02:27.804
I'm Brandy.

02:29.074 --> 02:31.708
I've had one of those
fuckers of a morning, Brandy.

02:31.710 --> 02:33.644
Mm, I'm so sorry to hear that.

02:33.646 --> 02:37.447
I had this meeting, and this
passive-aggressive motherfucker

02:37.449 --> 02:40.083
insinuates all
this shit about me.

02:40.085 --> 02:43.086
Why was I so blind to this
fucking prick who was suggesting

02:43.088 --> 02:44.421
I wasn't very good at my job?

02:44.423 --> 02:46.089
Which I am, by the way.

02:46.091 --> 02:47.891
God love him.

02:47.893 --> 02:50.127
You know, Croesus once said,
"Count no man happy

02:50.129 --> 02:51.662
until the end is known."

02:57.469 --> 03:00.570
Ah. Look at you.

03:00.572 --> 03:01.972
Let's make a deal.

03:01.974 --> 03:05.509
I don't know you,
and you don't know me,

03:05.511 --> 03:06.977
and since we don't
know each other,

03:06.979 --> 03:08.345
we've got nothing to lose.

03:08.347 --> 03:09.746
We can just be real.

03:09.748 --> 03:11.248
Okay?

03:11.250 --> 03:12.683
No masks.

03:12.685 --> 03:16.086
Just the experience
of Brandy and Peter.

03:16.088 --> 03:16.953
What do you say?

03:16.955 --> 03:18.155
Does this usually work?

03:23.028 --> 03:24.361
Okay.

03:27.766 --> 03:29.166
No masks, no bullshit.

03:33.205 --> 03:36.773
I'm up here thinking that I'd
love to pull the car over,

03:36.775 --> 03:42.279
get in the back, have a
drink with you, and then...

03:42.281 --> 03:44.014
see what else happens.

04:10.976 --> 04:12.743
Oh, I wish I could.

04:12.745 --> 04:14.077
I thought...

04:14.079 --> 04:16.346
I said I'd
love to have a drink.

04:16.348 --> 04:18.248
I have one sip of that,
and someone's going to jail,

04:18.250 --> 04:20.884
someone's going to the ER.

04:22.488 --> 04:26.723
I didn't come back here
for a drink, Peter.

04:26.725 --> 04:30.394
I wanted to see what you
looked like from this angle.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.496
You like what you see?

04:33.999 --> 04:36.967
Your pictures do
not do you justice.

04:41.039 --> 04:42.539
Come here.

04:42.541 --> 04:44.341
Hold on a second, Peter.

04:44.343 --> 04:46.877
I just want to ask
you a question first.

04:47.946 --> 04:49.246
Yes, ma'am.

04:49.248 --> 04:51.882
You're the boss now.

04:51.884 --> 04:52.582
What'd you do?

04:55.254 --> 04:57.187
What did I do?

04:57.189 --> 05:00.791
Well, I don't know
when you did it, but...

05:00.793 --> 05:04.027
I know you did something, Peter.

05:04.630 --> 05:06.930
What are you talking about?

05:06.932 --> 05:08.932
Why would someone not want
you to be alive anymore?

05:14.773 --> 05:17.641
You know, if you modernize it,
what Croesus actually said is,

05:17.643 --> 05:21.478
Count no man happy until
he's had a good death.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.313
I genuinely try to give my
subjects a good death

05:23.315 --> 05:25.248
when I can.

05:25.250 --> 05:28.385
But I can't do that unless
I know what you did.

05:30.088 --> 05:33.490
This isn't funny.

05:33.492 --> 05:35.926
Who put you up to this?

05:35.928 --> 05:37.093
Was it Ronny?

05:37.095 --> 05:38.628
Aw, that bastard.

05:38.630 --> 05:39.796
I knew it was.

05:40.732 --> 05:41.498
Let's give him a call.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.966
Put the phone down, please.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.636
Ah, fuck!

05:48.807 --> 05:49.639
Oh, please!

05:49.641 --> 05:50.740
Please don't, please!

05:50.742 --> 05:52.108
Don't beg.

05:52.110 --> 05:53.944
Just think of it as though
it's already happened,

05:53.946 --> 05:55.145
because it has.

05:55.147 --> 05:57.581
Now answer my question.

05:57.583 --> 05:59.950
Nothing!

05:59.952 --> 06:00.951
I'm a nothing!

06:00.953 --> 06:02.018
I'm a nobody!

06:02.020 --> 06:03.887
I just move money
around for companies!

06:05.357 --> 06:07.924
So you don't have
an answer for me?

06:08.994 --> 06:10.594
No! No, no, wait, wait.

06:10.596 --> 06:12.195
Okay, okay.

06:12.197 --> 06:15.499
I know why.
I know why.

06:22.274 --> 06:25.075
No, you don't.

06:25.377 --> 06:27.377
Subjects rarely do.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.779
Okay, okay, please.

06:29.781 --> 06:31.715
I'll pay you.

06:31.717 --> 06:33.116
I'm sure you hear
this all the time,

06:33.118 --> 06:36.553
but I'll give you every cent
that I've got. I'm in finance!

07:26.038 --> 07:29.673
Executive code 74598CG.

07:29.675 --> 07:32.842
Management Code 840227.

07:32.844 --> 07:34.878
Confirmed.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.413
Subject's closed.

07:36.415 --> 07:37.681
You sound a little off, kiddo.

07:40.519 --> 07:42.919
Anything to share?

07:44.122 --> 07:46.222
Nope.

07:46.224 --> 07:48.558
Nothing to report?

07:48.560 --> 07:50.226
Gotta get a new set of wigs.

07:50.228 --> 07:52.596
I don't know if they've
shrunk, or my head's grown.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.398
Any hiccups?

07:55.400 --> 07:57.133
You can stop worrying
about me now.

07:57.135 --> 07:58.068
I'll stop worrying

07:58.070 --> 08:00.070
when I stop worrying.

08:00.072 --> 08:01.204
How's the mind?

08:01.206 --> 08:02.138
Clear.

08:02.140 --> 08:03.239
Fine.

08:04.543 --> 08:05.308
You don't sound clear.

08:05.310 --> 08:06.610
Shut up.

08:06.612 --> 08:07.577
Or fine.

08:07.579 --> 08:08.878
Just please shut up.

08:08.880 --> 08:12.716
I'm just still in it,
that's all.

08:12.718 --> 08:14.284
Did you close this subject

08:14.286 --> 08:15.418
with dignity?

08:15.420 --> 08:16.920
Yep.

08:16.922 --> 08:17.721
Was management compromised?

08:17.723 --> 08:19.055
Nope.

08:19.057 --> 08:22.425
Then move the fuck on.

08:22.427 --> 08:24.561
I think I might go back
to Boston for a bit.

08:24.563 --> 08:26.396
Is that a good idea?

08:26.398 --> 08:28.064
It's personal, Duke.

08:28.066 --> 08:29.933
You want to talkprep for Riyadh?

08:29.935 --> 08:31.001
Later?

08:31.003 --> 08:32.168
Okay.

08:32.170 --> 08:34.471
Well, let's go over
it like it's your S-A-Ts,

08:34.473 --> 08:37.340
'cause management asked
for you specifically.

08:37.342 --> 08:39.009
They'll be watching.

08:39.011 --> 08:41.511
We cover every exit on this one.

08:41.513 --> 08:42.679
Duke.

08:42.681 --> 08:43.647
I'll call you

08:43.649 --> 08:45.148
if you don't call me.

08:45.150 --> 08:48.151
Keep your head down and
your powder dry, kiddo.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.452
Head down, powder dry.

08:49.454 --> 08:51.755
Got it.

09:06.605 --> 09:08.338
Just doing the final
boarding check.

09:09.474 --> 09:11.007
Flying time to Boston
will be approximately

09:11.009 --> 09:13.610
six hours and 40 minutes,

09:14.713 --> 09:16.212
bringing us in just
ahead of schedule.

11:37.956 --> 11:39.189
Checking in.

11:39.191 --> 11:41.090
Campbell.

12:10.388 --> 12:11.654
Hello?

12:11.656 --> 12:12.856
Management code 980456.

12:12.858 --> 12:16.025
Executive Order 98602FT

12:17.028 --> 12:17.794
We have a situation.

12:18.864 --> 12:20.363
She's one of our own,
so do nothing

12:20.365 --> 12:22.165
until you get the green light.

12:22.167 --> 12:23.933
Just keep her in your sights.

12:58.670 --> 13:00.703
Financial
advisor Peter Hawthorne

13:00.705 --> 13:04.407
has been discovered outside
Paris inside a burned car.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.009
French police are describing it

13:06.011 --> 13:08.611
as an assassination
style killing.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.013
Hawthorne, a key advisor

13:10.015 --> 13:12.015
to the International
Monetary Fund,

13:12.017 --> 13:14.450
had recently been accused
of money laundering

13:14.452 --> 13:16.519
and election tampering

13:16.521 --> 13:20.189
after several high level
officials of the...

Hey, Jude.

15:23.481 --> 15:24.647
Can I walk you home?

15:29.721 --> 15:31.888
Well, the funeral was a joy.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.489
Yeah, sorry about that.

15:33.491 --> 15:34.590
Yeah.

15:34.592 --> 15:35.925
I know you had to do
it all by yourself.

15:35.927 --> 15:39.562
I managed.
I managed big time.

15:39.564 --> 15:43.032
- How's Mom?
- Irritable.

15:43.034 --> 15:45.868
Oh. So she's fine, then.

15:47.172 --> 15:49.072
Here.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.740
Michael hates it.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.979
So that's still happening, huh?

16:01.086 --> 16:02.752
I'm sorry, okay?

16:03.288 --> 16:04.454
You're my fuckin' sister.

16:04.456 --> 16:07.023
Yeah, and you fuckin' left.

16:07.025 --> 16:10.026
It happened.

16:10.028 --> 16:11.727
I haven't seen you
for eight years.

16:11.729 --> 16:13.396
I called you.

16:13.398 --> 16:14.430
Yeah, every six months, for you
to deflect all our questions

16:14.432 --> 16:17.366
about where the fuck you are.

16:17.769 --> 16:18.901
You just quit
drinking, disappeared,

16:18.903 --> 16:22.905
and left me holding
all these bags of shit.

16:22.907 --> 16:24.607
I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

16:28.713 --> 16:30.446
Nice.

16:33.151 --> 16:35.284
I'd invite you in...

16:36.221 --> 16:38.454
but Michael lives
here with me now.

16:47.465 --> 16:50.333
I'll be at the hospital at nine
if you want to meet me there.

16:50.335 --> 16:52.735
Hospital?

16:52.737 --> 16:55.738
Are you fucking kidding me?
I emailed you last week.

16:55.740 --> 16:57.406
What?

16:57.408 --> 16:59.775
I figured that's
why you're here.

16:59.777 --> 17:03.679
Ava, Mom had a heart attack.

17:03.681 --> 17:05.481
It wasn't a heart attack.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.483
You're such a drama queen.

17:07.485 --> 17:09.085
It was angina.

17:09.087 --> 17:10.820
It's nothing.

17:10.822 --> 17:11.587
Heart attack.

17:15.627 --> 17:18.027
Baby, will you get me that
other blanket, please?

17:18.029 --> 17:20.062
The one on the chair?

17:24.335 --> 17:25.500
Thank you.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.668
You don't have to
stand in the doorway.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.971
Now that you're finally here,
you might as well join us...

17:28.973 --> 17:32.175
in the actual room.

17:33.444 --> 17:35.611
Here.

17:35.613 --> 17:37.480
Oh. No vase.

17:37.482 --> 17:39.382
Hey, which nurse is on tonight?

17:39.384 --> 17:42.285
Is it Gloria,
the-the tall redhead?

17:42.287 --> 17:43.719
It's Sophie, Ma.

17:43.721 --> 17:45.221
Oh, she's nice too.

17:45.223 --> 17:46.822
Maybe she can get us a vase.

17:46.824 --> 17:47.857
Mm.

17:47.859 --> 17:48.891
They're very sweet to me.

17:48.893 --> 17:50.526
They give me extra desserts.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.895
Not that my waistline
could use it.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.830
Well, I think you
look great, Ma.

17:54.832 --> 17:57.533
Hm, I would have thought
maybe you'd be shocked

17:57.535 --> 18:00.136
to see me this old,

18:00.138 --> 18:01.637
considering you
haven't laid eyes on me

18:01.639 --> 18:02.905
in such a long time.

18:03.808 --> 18:05.875
You look exactly the same age.

18:05.877 --> 18:07.009
It's really great work.

18:07.011 --> 18:10.012
Come on, Ava.

18:10.014 --> 18:11.347
Thank you, Ava.

18:11.349 --> 18:13.883
But really,
it's just my moisturizer.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.051
It's on the shelf
in the bathroom

18:15.053 --> 18:17.153
if you want to grab
some for yourself.

18:17.155 --> 18:18.570
It's funny,
I never would have thought

18:18.572 --> 18:19.988
that the Netherlands
would be that hot,

18:19.991 --> 18:23.426
but it seems like you're
getting a little sun damage.

18:23.428 --> 18:25.494
Sun is a great idea.

18:25.496 --> 18:27.330
Let's get you in the chair, Ma.

18:27.332 --> 18:28.497
I'm not in the mood.

18:34.038 --> 18:36.172
Dad only thought
about himself.

18:36.174 --> 18:38.874
Nonsense.

18:38.876 --> 18:41.577
Your dad was always pushing.

18:41.579 --> 18:46.682
Always indestructible, always
thinking he was invincible.

18:46.684 --> 18:47.550
And charm?

18:47.552 --> 18:48.517
Pfft.

18:48.519 --> 18:50.086
To burn.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.854
He just charmed them all.

18:51.856 --> 18:55.424
He had that manipulative
thing, like Ava.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.428
Your hair looks terrible.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.763
Thank you.

19:00.765 --> 19:04.467
Well it just... it just
sits there, like, meh.

19:04.469 --> 19:06.535
You could wear it
with some style.

19:06.537 --> 19:07.970
You're not in the army anymore.

19:07.972 --> 19:09.739
Well, I don't have
anyone to impress.

19:09.741 --> 19:12.308
I could cut it for you while
you're here, if you want.

19:12.310 --> 19:13.609
Well, I don't want
to put you out.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.311
I cut Judy's hair all the time.

19:15.313 --> 19:17.446
It is how I earned my living

19:17.448 --> 19:20.149
before I gave up
everything for you two.

19:20.151 --> 19:21.717
I do know what I'm doing.

19:21.719 --> 19:23.286
I'm sure you do, Ma.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.054
Forget that I mentioned it,
I wish I never brought it up.

19:25.056 --> 19:27.290
Fuck, if you want to cut my
hair, you can cut my hair, okay?

19:27.292 --> 19:30.326
Honey, how's Michael?

19:30.328 --> 19:32.161
- Uh...
- Have you seen him yet, Ava?

19:35.466 --> 19:36.966
No, not yet.

19:36.968 --> 19:40.236
When you do, just remember,

19:40.238 --> 19:44.907
try not to make it all about you
and your feelings, huh?

19:48.579 --> 19:50.613
So...

19:50.615 --> 19:52.682
Come on, let's hear it.

19:52.684 --> 19:54.216
Tell us all about the fancy job.

19:56.754 --> 19:58.854
Nothin' much to tell.

19:58.856 --> 20:00.923
So this one could be tricky.

20:00.925 --> 20:04.093
The approach should
be flirty but classy.

20:04.095 --> 20:07.096
Anything aggressive is going
to scare the General off.

20:07.098 --> 20:07.963
Is he married?

20:07.965 --> 20:08.698
Separated.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.099
What's the front door key?

20:10.101 --> 20:11.801
Larry Sullivan,
a good friend of your father's

20:11.803 --> 20:13.035
and the General.

20:13.037 --> 20:16.305
Sunday lunches at your
childhood home in London

20:16.307 --> 20:18.341
is a primary memory.

20:18.343 --> 20:21.143
Sullivan used to tell you and
your little brother war stories

20:21.145 --> 20:22.511
after the meal.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.213
Got it, that's good stuff.

20:24.215 --> 20:26.148
Stick to the script this time?

20:26.150 --> 20:28.551
The General's a big
weapons mover and shaker

20:28.553 --> 20:31.654
internationally, and management
stressed that it has to appear

20:31.656 --> 20:35.157
like natural causes.

20:35.159 --> 20:38.027
The necessary materials along
with your personal effects,

20:38.029 --> 20:40.062
will meet you in Riyadh.

20:40.064 --> 20:43.032
Go gentle on this one.
all eyes are on us.

20:43.034 --> 20:44.400
Message received.

20:44.402 --> 20:46.001
You be great, kiddo.

20:46.003 --> 20:46.802
Head down.

20:46.804 --> 20:47.670
Powder dry.

20:47.672 --> 20:49.872
I know, I know.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.502
You think that is funny?

20:52.919 --> 20:53.837
I'm sorry.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.840
You really have
a charming laugh.

20:56.881 --> 21:00.260
It's your third best quality.

21:02.220 --> 21:06.641
So what are my first and
second best qualities, then?

21:06.933 --> 21:09.686
Of course, well, we could
discuss this upstairs...

21:10.895 --> 21:13.940
I think at this time it's best
if we both leave you alone.

21:14.732 --> 21:16.732
Miss Porter.

21:21.072 --> 21:22.872
I'm so glad Larry sent you.

21:22.874 --> 21:24.173
Mm.

21:24.175 --> 21:26.075
Mr. Sullivan's a good
friend of my father's.

21:26.077 --> 21:29.979
Practically grew up with him
at our house every weekend.

21:32.283 --> 21:35.684
Well, so leave us now,
gentlemen.

21:38.055 --> 21:40.790
So, the ambassador is a
very good friend of mine

21:40.792 --> 21:45.194
and lets me use his office to
escape these horrible parties.

21:46.531 --> 21:48.864
May I see it?

21:49.734 --> 21:52.601
Yes. Please.

21:52.603 --> 21:55.771
So how are you enjoying
this trip in Saudi Arabia?

21:57.275 --> 21:58.541
I must warn you...

22:00.153 --> 22:02.280
I'm a little slut.

22:10.455 --> 22:12.555
Oh, my God.

22:15.760 --> 22:20.563
I... I really like you.

22:35.947 --> 22:37.746
It's completely painless.

22:39.684 --> 22:41.584
It'll take about 15 minutes.

22:46.023 --> 22:48.691
Everyone will think you died of
a stress-related heart attack.

22:58.636 --> 23:01.370
You did something bad.

23:01.372 --> 23:03.239
Right?

23:06.143 --> 23:10.179
They wouldn't have
sent me if you hadn't.

23:14.018 --> 23:16.719
I wish I knew what it was.

23:30.067 --> 23:31.800
It was the name, right?

23:31.802 --> 23:33.002
Sullivan.

23:33.004 --> 23:34.803
Faulty fuckin' intel, right?

23:34.805 --> 23:36.572
I said the name wrong.

23:36.574 --> 23:37.239
Fuck you.

24:38.812 --> 24:40.105
Help!

24:43.233 --> 24:44.275
Help! Help!

24:44.317 --> 24:45.527
Get her downstairs, it
looks like she's been hit.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.946
Help the General!

24:49.814 --> 24:51.146
Oh, my God!

24:51.148 --> 24:53.649
Let's get you down to safety.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.052
It'll be all right.
Calm down.

25:06.230 --> 25:07.830
Almost there.

25:13.170 --> 25:15.004
Keep moving, please.

25:15.439 --> 25:17.740
I'm going to throw up if I
don't sit down for a second.

25:17.742 --> 25:20.342
Don't move.

26:24.975 --> 26:27.042
Fuck.

27:07.885 --> 27:09.885
Sullivan, O'Sullivan.

27:09.887 --> 27:10.953
It's a typo.

27:10.955 --> 27:12.688
I disagree.

27:12.690 --> 27:15.090
Who was responsible?

27:15.092 --> 27:17.760
Well, let's say for the
purposes of this conversation,

27:17.762 --> 27:18.861
it's my fault.

27:18.863 --> 27:20.229
I'm supposed to get
you in and out safely.

27:20.231 --> 27:21.029
I failed.

27:21.031 --> 27:23.132
I'm sorry, darling.

27:23.134 --> 27:25.634
It was meant to look
like natural causes.

27:25.636 --> 27:26.902
I can do natural causes.

27:26.904 --> 27:29.037
I know you can.

27:29.039 --> 27:31.240
I can do an accident.

27:31.242 --> 27:32.241
I can do gentle.

27:32.243 --> 27:33.308
I know.

27:36.147 --> 27:38.380
Duke, if you're gonna
close me, just do it now.

27:38.382 --> 27:40.516
Management knows
it's not your fault.

27:45.556 --> 27:47.089
Okay.

27:47.091 --> 27:48.724
They arranged for one of the
more obscure Middle Eastern

27:48.726 --> 27:51.593
terror factions to
claim responsibility.

27:51.595 --> 27:54.897
So some anti-Western group's
gonna get 20 rocket launchers.

27:54.899 --> 27:56.265
It's an error.

27:56.267 --> 27:59.301
Let's move the fuck on.

28:06.443 --> 28:09.945
How did the General fall
into our parameters?

28:09.947 --> 28:12.848
Ava, don't tell me you've been
asking the subjects

28:12.850 --> 28:15.751
what they did wrong again.

28:15.753 --> 28:19.822
We're not going to survive
another episode of that.

28:19.824 --> 28:21.623
Have you been using again?

28:21.625 --> 28:23.625
No.

28:23.627 --> 28:25.460
You're an addict.

28:25.462 --> 28:28.197
Do you remember what that
behavior led to last time?

28:28.199 --> 28:29.631
Yeah.

28:29.633 --> 28:31.767
The hospitalization of three
wait staff 'cause they...

28:31.769 --> 28:33.101
It's not like that this time.

28:33.103 --> 28:34.870
It's just,
sometimes I just want to know

28:34.872 --> 28:36.338
why I'm closing somebody.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.006
Who gives a shit?

28:38.008 --> 28:40.175
You're client-facing.

28:40.177 --> 28:43.846
You're not a member of the
parole board or a prison shrink.

28:43.848 --> 28:47.449
You're there to get the
SignEasy on the toe tag.

28:47.451 --> 28:51.453
Yours is not to reason why,
yours is to do or die.

28:54.992 --> 28:56.658
You know, I'm not going to
be able to protect you

28:56.660 --> 28:57.826
a second time.

28:57.828 --> 28:59.161
Duke.

28:59.163 --> 29:00.796
I'm good.

29:00.798 --> 29:01.630
All right?

29:01.632 --> 29:03.131
I promise you.

29:05.002 --> 29:07.836
Well, management is going
to be extra cautious.

29:07.838 --> 29:09.404
Okay.

29:09.406 --> 29:12.241
They want you off the
grid for a beat or two.

29:15.212 --> 29:17.045
My father died.

29:19.183 --> 29:21.216
I know.

29:21.218 --> 29:23.151
You didn't kill him, did you?

29:23.153 --> 29:24.486
Okay.

29:28.926 --> 29:31.026
I need to go back
to Boston anyway.

29:31.028 --> 29:32.895
Tie up some loose ends.

29:32.897 --> 29:35.197
Finish some stuff.

29:35.199 --> 29:36.999
That's a lot of pain points.

29:37.001 --> 29:41.370
I know that.

29:41.372 --> 29:43.672
You want me to tell management
you'd like time off?

29:43.674 --> 29:44.840
Yeah.

29:44.842 --> 29:45.807
I already did.

29:50.114 --> 29:51.713
You asshole.

29:51.715 --> 29:53.949
You're such an asshole.

30:53.978 --> 30:55.410
And there you are.

30:55.412 --> 30:57.813
Michael?

30:57.815 --> 30:58.814
You look good.

30:58.816 --> 31:00.782
I don't. I don't.

31:00.784 --> 31:02.084
But thanks for saying it.

31:02.086 --> 31:03.852
You do, actually.

31:06.790 --> 31:08.757
Judy's inside with your mother.

31:08.759 --> 31:10.792
Oh. Some things never
change, do they?

31:10.794 --> 31:13.762
Some things do.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.899
I'm happy for you guys.

31:21.005 --> 31:22.838
I really am.

31:26.310 --> 31:27.976
I probably should have told
you my sister's in town.

31:27.978 --> 31:29.211
Yeah.

31:29.213 --> 31:30.879
You gonna start showing
up without calling first?

31:30.881 --> 31:32.280
To visit my mother?

31:32.282 --> 31:34.349
I can hear you out there,
you know.

31:34.351 --> 31:37.919
Come help me with
this fucking TV!

31:43.394 --> 31:45.060
Can you believe
Michael remembered?

31:45.062 --> 31:46.695
Thank you, Michael.

31:46.697 --> 31:50.465
Ava, can you believe Michael
remembered I love irises?

31:50.467 --> 31:52.000
Uh, yeah, I can believe
that he'd remember

31:52.002 --> 31:54.102
something like that.

31:54.571 --> 31:55.804
Want me to take a look at it?

31:55.806 --> 31:57.205
Nope.

31:57.207 --> 31:59.241
Leave it, you're going to
break the whole damn thing.

31:59.243 --> 32:00.675
Uhh, it's fine, it's
just the antenna.

32:00.677 --> 32:03.578
I've almost got it.

32:05.149 --> 32:07.315
The three of you should go
out and have a nice dinner

32:07.317 --> 32:09.251
tomorrow night.

32:10.020 --> 32:11.853
- Uh. Ma, I...
- No, no.

32:11.855 --> 32:13.388
Ava, take them somewhere nice.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.824
- Uh, I don't...
- No, go on. Go on. Go on.

32:15.826 --> 32:17.859
I need to know the
three of you get along.

32:17.861 --> 32:20.262
In case anything,
you know, happens to me.

32:20.264 --> 32:21.229
Touch wood.

32:21.231 --> 32:23.432
Ma, stop it.

32:27.371 --> 32:29.104
Wow, you fixed it.

32:29.106 --> 32:30.839
Good work.

32:30.841 --> 32:32.274
Hm.

32:32.276 --> 32:34.109
I guess there was
nothing wrong with it.

32:37.014 --> 32:40.682
About 10 years ago,
at my most fucked up,

32:40.684 --> 32:42.484
I caught my dad
having an affair.

32:45.189 --> 32:47.856
And I told him that
if he didn't tell Mom,

32:47.858 --> 32:49.624
that I was going
to do it myself.

32:50.360 --> 32:54.296
So... he cried.

32:54.298 --> 32:59.167
And he promised me that he
would tell her about it.

33:00.404 --> 33:02.771
But what he did instead was...

33:04.808 --> 33:09.611
tell her that he caught me
stealing money from his wallet.

33:09.613 --> 33:13.081
He said that I tried to
blackmail him into giving me

33:13.083 --> 33:19.321
$1,000, and that if
he wouldn't do it,

33:19.323 --> 33:24.860
that I would make up a story
about him having an affair.

33:26.830 --> 33:30.265
I was a total alcoholic-addict
piece of shit at the time who

33:30.267 --> 33:34.536
had been caught stealing
money for drugs, so...

33:36.273 --> 33:38.673
naturally, she believed him.

33:41.145 --> 33:43.245
I don't blame her.

33:45.749 --> 33:47.482
But him...

33:51.488 --> 33:55.023
The look on his face when she
was confronting me about it.

33:57.995 --> 34:01.763
It was like he was amused...

34:01.765 --> 34:04.499
for using me to save his ass.

34:07.838 --> 34:10.605
I couldn't get through
that day without using.

34:12.676 --> 34:14.609
Made me want to kill him.

34:19.283 --> 34:21.016
Oh, I fuckin'
fantasized about it.

34:26.290 --> 34:30.525
And I knew that if I didn't
leave immediately, that I would.

34:33.297 --> 34:35.463
So...

34:36.466 --> 34:38.567
I left and I joined the army.

34:42.873 --> 34:46.141
When I heard he was dead,
I knew it was safe to come back.

34:49.680 --> 34:51.413
That's all I got.

34:52.549 --> 34:54.816
Thank you for sharing.

34:56.320 --> 34:58.553
Hey, I'm Tony and
I'm an alcoholic.

34:58.555 --> 35:01.289
Hi, Tony.

35:32.422 --> 35:34.189
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:38.128 --> 35:40.095
So when are our Syrian friends
going to claim responsibility,

35:40.097 --> 35:41.129
has that been arranged?

35:41.131 --> 35:42.631
Being arranged, as we speak.

35:42.633 --> 35:44.165
Okay.

35:50.807 --> 35:52.607
Goodness gracious me.

35:53.543 --> 35:55.343
That was a hiccup.

35:55.779 --> 35:57.545
That was more than a hiccup.

35:57.547 --> 36:00.448
The Saudi branch has
completed refurbishment.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.485
They say they're ready to
chase returns and get filled.

36:03.487 --> 36:06.621
They say there's no way
it can lead back to us.

36:07.291 --> 36:08.590
There's one way.

36:08.592 --> 36:09.924
No, not her.

36:09.926 --> 36:12.327
I recruited her, I trained her.

36:12.329 --> 36:13.762
You recruited me,
you trained me.

36:13.764 --> 36:14.863
I say she's a liability.

36:16.566 --> 36:17.732
Simon.

36:17.734 --> 36:19.301
She's best of breed.

36:19.303 --> 36:21.603
There's no way she can be ID'd.

36:21.605 --> 36:22.337
There's a risk factor.

36:24.274 --> 36:25.273
Have you forgotten?

36:25.275 --> 36:26.775
That was two years ago.

36:26.777 --> 36:29.177
And she had valid doubts
about the ethical merits

36:29.179 --> 36:31.446
of a couple of closures.

36:31.448 --> 36:34.316
Valid doubts...

36:34.318 --> 36:36.951
the pursuit of which led her
to have a fuckin' meltdown.

36:36.953 --> 36:38.320
And she got back on track.

36:38.322 --> 36:41.456
She's talking
to the fuckin' targets!

36:41.458 --> 36:43.491
Again!

36:43.794 --> 36:45.093
You told me...

36:45.095 --> 36:48.530
when soldiers disobey the
chain of command, people die.

36:48.532 --> 36:50.632
H-How do we know this?

36:50.634 --> 36:53.101
I heard her.

36:53.103 --> 36:54.836
I was in France.

37:02.479 --> 37:06.448
Saudi Arabia wasn't her fault,
that's all I'm saying.

37:07.384 --> 37:09.150
So whose fault was it?

37:09.152 --> 37:14.522
My executive, my care and
feeding, my responsibility.

37:14.524 --> 37:16.124
Well, thank you.

37:16.126 --> 37:17.092
Thank you for saying it.

37:19.963 --> 37:22.330
All right, then.

37:22.332 --> 37:25.233
She is the most gifted
we have, you know that.

37:25.235 --> 37:26.968
Okay.

37:26.970 --> 37:28.670
She'll take a rest.

37:28.672 --> 37:31.139
Let the dust settle.

37:31.141 --> 37:32.841
I'll re-engage her
when the time is right.

37:32.843 --> 37:34.676
That's the best decision.

37:34.678 --> 37:37.011
It's your decision, Duke.

37:37.013 --> 37:39.314
Just lettin' you make it.

37:39.316 --> 37:40.749
Yeah.

37:40.751 --> 37:41.750
Now get the fuck out of
here and let me enjoy

37:41.752 --> 37:43.585
me son's christening.

37:43.587 --> 37:45.186
Yeah.

37:45.188 --> 37:47.422
Congrats.

38:07.544 --> 38:08.777
So?

38:11.114 --> 38:12.514
She's always been
Duke's favorite,

38:12.516 --> 38:15.383
but she's a loose cannon and
a danger to the organization.

38:15.385 --> 38:18.286
I wanted her killed in Riyadh
so he wouldn't know it was us.

38:18.288 --> 38:20.522
But now...

38:20.524 --> 38:22.690
Call Alain.

38:22.692 --> 38:26.361
Tell him tooth or finger,
I don't care which.

38:26.363 --> 38:27.896
I want to see a piece of her.

38:27.898 --> 38:29.564
Hm.

38:29.566 --> 38:31.132
What about Duke?

38:31.134 --> 38:32.700
Don't you worry about Duke.

38:32.702 --> 38:34.702
- But Dad...
- Listen.

38:34.704 --> 38:37.605
Five days,
that man was tortured,

38:37.607 --> 38:40.141
and he didn't give me up.

38:40.143 --> 38:43.278
Five days.

38:43.713 --> 38:45.046
But won't he know it was us?

38:45.048 --> 38:46.714
Doesn't matter,
go outside to the party.

38:46.716 --> 38:48.483
Spend some time with your
little brother, will you?

38:48.485 --> 38:50.785
Go on.

38:50.787 --> 38:51.886
Half-brother.

38:51.888 --> 38:53.555
I'm good.

42:02.078 --> 42:04.512
- I know you're angry...
- Stop talking.

42:04.514 --> 42:05.980
I just...

42:05.982 --> 42:06.981
You know how I always say
stop talking and you don't,

42:06.983 --> 42:08.650
and it's part of our
hilarious banter?

42:08.652 --> 42:12.987
This time I'm actually
telling you stop talking.

42:16.259 --> 42:18.326
You're showing me a gun?

42:18.328 --> 42:20.862
You know what happened to the
last person who showed me a gun?

42:20.864 --> 42:22.964
And the person before that?

42:22.966 --> 42:26.200
And the person before that, and
so on, if you follow my drift?

42:28.471 --> 42:31.172
Saudi Arabia was their fuckup.

42:31.174 --> 42:32.707
It was your fuckup, Duke.

42:32.709 --> 42:34.642
You're trying to close me?

42:34.644 --> 42:39.947
I know it may look like that,
but honestly, and no offense,

42:39.949 --> 42:41.949
the company is not
trying to close you.

42:41.951 --> 42:45.053
If they wanted you closed,
you'd be closed.

42:45.055 --> 42:46.220
Uh-huh.

42:46.222 --> 42:47.655
And you're sure of that
because...?

42:47.657 --> 42:51.225
Because it was discussed.

42:51.227 --> 42:52.360
Right.

42:52.362 --> 42:53.895
Of course it was
fuckin' discussed.

42:53.897 --> 42:56.798
You keep breaking protocol.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.566
I warned you.

43:01.137 --> 43:03.638
Anyway, I told Simon
you're not to be touched,

43:03.640 --> 43:06.674
and if he wanted to do
something like that,

43:06.676 --> 43:08.876
he would have to involve me.

43:08.878 --> 43:11.879
And kill me.

43:13.516 --> 43:16.751
Say that again.

43:16.753 --> 43:18.820
The company had
nothing to do with it.

43:22.192 --> 43:26.327
I got an ID on the guy from
my sources at Boston PD.

43:26.329 --> 43:30.331
He's ex-French Special Forces,
dishonorably discharged,

43:30.333 --> 43:32.200
and MIA for years.

43:32.202 --> 43:34.235
He had a drug problem.

43:34.237 --> 43:38.506
So it would seem that an
exceptionally unlucky junkie

43:38.508 --> 43:39.841
tried to mug you...

43:39.843 --> 43:42.210
You don't believe that, Duke.

43:42.212 --> 43:46.214
Uh, because operatives with
black arts combat training

43:46.216 --> 43:48.683
can't be addicts?

43:48.685 --> 43:50.718
I know you don't trust anybody.

43:50.720 --> 43:53.354
But I'm not anybody.

43:53.356 --> 43:57.391
So, I'm gonna take my
hands out of my pockets,

43:57.393 --> 44:01.696
I'm gonna put them up like this,
I'm going to step toward you...

44:01.698 --> 44:05.600
place them on your shoulders
in a comforting,

44:05.602 --> 44:07.335
but firm, fatherly manner...

44:10.140 --> 44:12.073
and I'm going to ask you.

44:12.075 --> 44:13.274
Are you sure you
don't want me to

44:13.276 --> 44:16.711
hang around for a few days,
keep an eye on you?

44:24.053 --> 44:26.020
I came here to get a
break from you, remember?

44:28.258 --> 44:29.891
Here's his gun.

44:31.494 --> 44:32.727
Can you run it for me?

44:32.729 --> 44:34.028
Will do.

45:12.969 --> 45:14.502
- He's a punk.
- No.

45:14.504 --> 45:16.103
He's a punk.

45:16.105 --> 45:19.340
- Teddy's a great bass player.
- He's a fine bass player.

45:19.342 --> 45:21.275
And 'fine' not as
in, Oh, he's fine.

45:21.277 --> 45:22.510
'Fine' as in average.

45:22.512 --> 45:24.111
You can do better.

45:24.113 --> 45:26.113
He hates Teddy coz he hit on
me at the first gig we played.

45:26.115 --> 45:28.950
What? That's not true.
I don't even remember that.

45:28.952 --> 45:30.384
Oh, you don't?

45:30.386 --> 45:31.819
- No?
- No.

45:31.821 --> 45:33.621
Oh, she can't drink that.

45:38.394 --> 45:40.795
But first,
bullshit you'd forgotten?

45:40.797 --> 45:42.330
Mm-hm.

45:42.332 --> 45:45.166
And second, he just didn't
know that I had a boyfriend.

45:45.168 --> 45:47.168
Hm. Yeah, okay.

45:47.170 --> 45:49.237
Judy's in this incredible band,
you gotta hear 'em.

45:49.239 --> 45:50.204
She heard actually.

45:50.206 --> 45:51.038
Thank you, by the way.

45:51.040 --> 45:53.140
She heard us play
the other night.

45:53.142 --> 45:54.475
They're great.

45:54.477 --> 45:56.510
You should come hear them
play at Wally's on Friday.

45:56.512 --> 45:58.512
You're playing Wally's Cafe?

45:58.514 --> 46:00.915
You're gonna blow up, Jude.

46:00.917 --> 46:01.983
Well, you're biased.

46:01.985 --> 46:03.918
Wow, you always wanted
to play at Wally's.

46:03.920 --> 46:06.254
Come on, with all
the fake modesty.

46:06.256 --> 46:07.922
You know you rant and
rave every night about

46:07.924 --> 46:10.725
how underappreciated
you guys are.

46:10.727 --> 46:12.693
Don't fucking say that.

46:12.695 --> 46:14.595
What?

46:14.597 --> 46:17.231
Could you not say that kind of
fuckin' stuff in front of her?

46:17.233 --> 46:18.199
What kind of stuff?

46:18.201 --> 46:19.033
What did I say?

46:19.035 --> 46:19.700
You didn't say anything.

46:23.539 --> 46:24.605
Why are you fuckin' asking her?

46:25.909 --> 46:27.341
Don't laugh at me.

46:27.343 --> 46:28.709
Judy, he's not laughing at you.

46:28.711 --> 46:30.544
Okay, just don't do that.

46:30.546 --> 46:32.680
Listen, what I say at home,
I say it at home.

46:32.682 --> 46:34.682
And I... I've just been
complimenting you for the past

46:34.684 --> 46:36.384
10 minutes, I was talkin'
about how brilliant you are.

46:36.386 --> 46:37.618
Was that hard for you?

46:37.620 --> 46:39.152
No. Look, you know, what?
I'm not gonna do this.

46:39.154 --> 46:40.687
- Was it a chore for you?
- You're drunk. Okay?

46:41.891 --> 46:43.858
That's what it is, you're drunk.

46:43.860 --> 46:45.459
So.

46:45.461 --> 46:47.361
So, what's... what's
your job like?

46:47.363 --> 46:48.930
How's it work?

46:48.932 --> 46:51.232
Oh, uh, it's not
that interesting.

46:51.234 --> 46:54.769
Events and functions and endless
cocktail parties where the

46:54.771 --> 46:57.038
food's terrible and I can't
drink the free booze.

46:57.040 --> 46:59.040
What's the point?

46:59.042 --> 47:00.574
So...

47:00.576 --> 47:02.810
running around Beijing trying
to find almond milk for the

47:02.812 --> 47:06.480
delegate from France
who's lactose intolerant.

47:06.482 --> 47:08.516
Sounds like a glorified
flight attendant.

47:14.557 --> 47:18.326
Oh, it's so weird being here.

47:18.328 --> 47:20.494
There's so many memories here.

47:20.496 --> 47:23.564
What memories?

47:23.566 --> 47:24.732
- Babe.
- What?

47:24.734 --> 47:25.967
She said it.

47:25.969 --> 47:27.401
Let her explain it.

47:27.403 --> 47:29.303
I didn't mean what
you're thinking, Jude.

47:29.305 --> 47:30.571
No? You did.

47:32.942 --> 47:35.042
You guys have fun.

47:39.449 --> 47:40.948
Je-sus.

47:40.950 --> 47:42.650
Well...

47:42.652 --> 47:44.251
she was happy for a while there.

47:44.253 --> 47:45.686
Mm-hm, and then?

47:45.688 --> 47:47.154
And then your father died.

47:47.156 --> 47:50.124
And she was the only one here
to take care of everything.

47:50.126 --> 47:51.158
Then that, Ava.

47:53.429 --> 47:54.462
Okay.

47:54.464 --> 47:56.464
No, it's not, actually.

47:56.466 --> 47:58.499
What does that mean?

48:02.171 --> 48:03.170
Fine, I'll go talk to her.

48:03.172 --> 48:05.139
No.

48:05.141 --> 48:08.642
You don't get to come in here
and try to fix everything.

48:08.644 --> 48:10.277
Okay?

48:10.279 --> 48:13.914
You don't get to be that person.

48:18.154 --> 48:20.254
Sorry.

48:23.693 --> 48:27.361
I'm the one who
should apologize.

48:28.564 --> 48:31.232
I left without saying goodbye.

48:34.971 --> 48:36.370
You did.

49:07.537 --> 49:08.536
Yeah?

49:08.538 --> 49:11.238
Ava?

49:15.845 --> 49:16.877
Sorry it's so late,
I don't know what to do.

49:16.879 --> 49:18.913
What do you mean you
don't know what to do?

49:18.915 --> 49:21.182
Uh, Michael hasn't come home.

49:24.053 --> 49:26.053
He went out and he
hasn't come home.

49:26.055 --> 49:31.692
Well, I'm sure he's just cooling
off like he always does, right?

49:31.694 --> 49:34.095
You must be fucking loving this.

49:34.097 --> 49:36.831
Why would I love you waking
me up at 5 am, yelling at me?

49:39.302 --> 49:40.701
Fine, you know what?

49:40.703 --> 49:41.869
I'm gonna go.

49:41.871 --> 49:43.237
Jude.

49:43.239 --> 49:44.972
I know you don't trust me.

49:44.974 --> 49:46.440
I know I let you
down and disappeared.

49:46.442 --> 49:47.808
But I'm here now.

49:47.810 --> 49:50.044
Please...

49:50.046 --> 49:52.213
just talk to me.

49:56.419 --> 49:58.586
It's happened before.

49:58.588 --> 50:01.822
Sometimes he doesn't
come home from...

50:03.459 --> 50:04.358
Come home from where?

50:10.967 --> 50:12.366
When did he start
gambling again?

50:16.939 --> 50:19.473
He never stopped.

50:23.412 --> 50:24.245
Right.

50:24.247 --> 50:25.479
He's good at it.

50:25.481 --> 50:27.181
You know that.

50:27.183 --> 50:28.916
And we could really make a
start with what he could

50:28.918 --> 50:30.251
pull down at the tracks.

50:30.253 --> 50:31.752
But I told him...

50:31.754 --> 50:32.686
no cards.

50:32.688 --> 50:34.622
I told him no fucking cards.

50:34.624 --> 50:37.291
Those people are...

50:37.293 --> 50:38.592
they're so crazy.

50:38.594 --> 50:40.828
You're sure he's playing cards?

50:43.666 --> 50:44.465
It's okay.

50:44.467 --> 50:46.267
I fucking... I hate it.

50:46.269 --> 50:49.136
'Cause part of me is hoping
you know where he is,

50:49.138 --> 50:53.240
and the other part is
gonna be pissed if...

50:55.611 --> 50:57.144
So do you?

50:57.146 --> 50:59.213
No.

50:59.215 --> 51:01.849
Sorry.

51:17.700 --> 51:19.200
Haven't seen you in a while.

51:19.202 --> 51:20.134
Huh.

51:20.136 --> 51:21.001
Is she expecting you?

51:21.003 --> 51:21.969
Isn't she always?

52:17.360 --> 52:19.360
Fuck no.

52:19.362 --> 52:20.694
Hey, Toni.

52:20.696 --> 52:22.596
My little lost lamb...

52:22.598 --> 52:25.065
who threw up on my floor.

52:25.067 --> 52:28.369
That was eight years ago.

52:28.371 --> 52:31.438
I'm out.

52:31.440 --> 52:35.643
I found this pretty thing
outside my door half-dead

52:35.645 --> 52:37.611
with a needle stuck
between her toes.

52:38.281 --> 52:40.914
A lot has changed.

52:40.916 --> 52:42.750
I can see that.

52:42.752 --> 52:44.952
She's not a thankful person.

52:44.954 --> 52:48.622
I cleaned her up,
let her live on my sofa.

52:48.624 --> 52:52.326
And then she took
my rabbit's foot.

52:52.328 --> 52:54.695
Now she thinks she
can take him again.

52:56.599 --> 52:57.731
Cash him out.

52:57.733 --> 52:59.400
He's got someplace
he's gotta be.

52:59.402 --> 53:02.970
That someplace isn't
with you anymore, is it?

53:02.972 --> 53:04.972
Looking good.

53:04.974 --> 53:06.674
How long you been clean?

53:08.978 --> 53:10.744
Long enough.

53:11.814 --> 53:13.447
Tick-tock.

53:15.251 --> 53:18.519
That's enough, Toni.

53:18.521 --> 53:19.486
Let's go.

53:19.488 --> 53:21.088
I always liked you...

53:21.090 --> 53:22.456
in my way.

53:22.458 --> 53:25.292
Don't push my patience.

53:25.294 --> 53:26.927
You need to go.

53:26.929 --> 53:29.163
I'm going to be here
maybe a hour or so.

53:29.165 --> 53:30.497
How much are you into her for?

53:30.499 --> 53:32.032
He's not leaving this game.

53:32.034 --> 53:33.634
Listen... You heard her.

53:33.636 --> 53:34.935
Time to go.

53:34.937 --> 53:35.836
Get your fuckin' hands off me.

53:57.293 --> 53:58.625
Come on, Michael.

53:58.627 --> 54:00.260
Lead the way.

54:05.368 --> 54:06.533
Let's see how many holes
I can put in her face

54:06.535 --> 54:07.968
before you shoot me.

54:07.970 --> 54:09.036
Put it away.

54:09.038 --> 54:11.472
Put it down.

54:20.683 --> 54:24.051
Who taught you those
slick moves back there?

54:24.053 --> 54:27.421
You always were a quick
study though, weren't you?

54:27.423 --> 54:30.557
You had everyone's
number, right?

54:31.527 --> 54:32.826
I'm going to leave you here.

54:33.863 --> 54:35.396
You can get out now.

54:35.398 --> 54:38.866
It's tomorrow... and the next
day and the day after

54:38.868 --> 54:40.901
that you need to worry about.

54:47.676 --> 54:49.176
How much?

54:49.178 --> 54:50.444
I don't care about the money.

54:50.446 --> 54:51.879
Let's pretend for a
second that you do.

54:51.881 --> 54:53.247
How much does he owe you?

54:53.249 --> 54:56.183
Seventy five, give or take.

54:56.185 --> 54:57.918
Give me 36 hours.

54:57.920 --> 54:59.787
You don't fuck with him.

54:59.789 --> 55:01.955
That'd be mighty
magnanimous of me.

55:01.957 --> 55:04.425
You got a lot of fucking nerve.

55:04.427 --> 55:06.360
I guess we both do.

55:06.362 --> 55:08.195
Yeah.

55:18.908 --> 55:21.041
What the fuck was that?

55:21.043 --> 55:23.043
Judy came to my hotel,
she was worried about you.

55:23.045 --> 55:25.379
That's not what
I'm talking about.

55:25.381 --> 55:26.980
All the stuff
you was doing.

55:26.982 --> 55:28.382
Who the fuck is in
front of me right now?

55:28.384 --> 55:30.717
Wonder Woman?

55:30.719 --> 55:32.386
I started studying martial
arts when I was in rehab.

55:32.388 --> 55:33.487
Nah.

55:33.489 --> 55:34.721
No.

55:34.723 --> 55:36.623
Don't give me the story
you give everybody else.

55:36.625 --> 55:38.091
You tell me the truth.

55:38.093 --> 55:40.194
Or get the fuck outta my face.

55:44.433 --> 55:45.732
Oh, it's like that now?

55:45.734 --> 55:46.834
You want to talk
about my honesty?

55:46.836 --> 55:48.635
Look, I'm just trying
to get out of debt.

55:48.637 --> 55:50.671
You do realize the number's
meant to get smaller, right?

55:50.673 --> 55:52.005
No shit.

55:52.007 --> 55:54.575
Toni's no joke, Michael.

55:54.577 --> 55:56.443
Well, she's the only
one who would stake me.

55:56.445 --> 55:57.945
That's helped you.

55:57.947 --> 55:58.946
Oh, yeah?

55:58.948 --> 56:00.814
Just what have you
been up to, Cakes?

56:00.816 --> 56:02.583
Don't call me that,
I'm not that person anymore.

56:02.585 --> 56:03.951
Oh, yes you are.

56:03.953 --> 56:08.121
You'll always be Cakes to me.

56:08.123 --> 56:11.425
I asked you to marry me,
and you said yes.

56:11.427 --> 56:13.894
And then you just disappear
for eight fuckin' years!

56:19.468 --> 56:21.768
I made a mistake with my family
and I had to get away from it.

56:21.770 --> 56:24.771
You couldn't talk
to me about it?

56:28.477 --> 56:29.710
So I got you a few days.

56:29.712 --> 56:31.111
How much can you rustle up?

56:31.113 --> 56:32.546
Not enough.

56:32.548 --> 56:34.281
Well, do you need cash?

56:34.283 --> 56:36.717
Not from you.

56:36.719 --> 56:39.286
What is your alternative,
Michael?

56:39.288 --> 56:42.122
This is my alternative...
right here.

56:42.124 --> 56:43.023
What the fuck are you
going to do with that?

56:43.025 --> 56:44.491
You gonna kill her?

56:44.493 --> 56:45.993
I owe her 80 grand.

56:45.995 --> 56:51.732
Crush or no crush, lucky charm...
she's gonna come for it.

56:51.734 --> 56:55.235
And I gotta think
about Judy and...

56:55.237 --> 56:56.837
Hey.

56:56.839 --> 56:57.905
Don't do that.

56:57.907 --> 56:59.172
What are you doing?

56:59.174 --> 57:01.975
I'm not yours anymore.

57:11.353 --> 57:14.421
So you're happy.

57:14.423 --> 57:18.492
I asked her to marry me.

57:18.494 --> 57:20.294
And she said yes.

57:21.397 --> 57:22.796
Ava.

57:24.033 --> 57:24.898
Ava!

58:05.274 --> 58:07.808
What'll it be?

58:07.810 --> 58:10.143
Scotch, double.

58:10.145 --> 58:11.979
You got it.

58:20.222 --> 58:21.488
Shit.

58:21.490 --> 58:23.323
You want it on the rocks?

58:23.325 --> 58:24.558
Sure.

58:24.560 --> 58:25.926
Good.

58:25.928 --> 58:27.995
'Cause you got it on the rocks.

58:30.265 --> 58:31.965
You a guest here at the hotel?

58:34.236 --> 58:38.572
Room number please?

58:42.344 --> 58:43.677
Ma'am?

58:43.679 --> 58:44.945
You want me to charge
this to your room?

58:44.947 --> 58:46.013
Sure.

58:53.622 --> 58:54.588
Hey, man.

58:54.590 --> 58:55.989
Hey.

58:55.991 --> 58:57.457
I finally got me
73-year-old mother

58:57.459 --> 58:59.459
to agree to come over here.

58:59.461 --> 59:01.662
She's never been on a plane,
she's never left Ireland.

59:01.664 --> 59:03.764
She's gonna be here
within the hour,

59:03.766 --> 59:05.832
so at the expense of
sounding like a pushy prick,

59:05.834 --> 59:07.768
what's on your mind?

59:08.337 --> 59:12.606
So, Saudi Arabia wasn't
an error, was it?

59:12.608 --> 59:17.210
You set her up, you wanted
her to get killed, right?

59:18.447 --> 59:20.147
I underestimated her.

59:20.149 --> 59:22.015
That was an error.

59:22.017 --> 59:23.784
I can see that now.

59:23.786 --> 59:26.553
And the executive you sent
to Boston to close her?

59:26.555 --> 59:30.290
You haven't heard from
him in 24 hours or so?

59:30.292 --> 59:34.795
That may count as
an error as well.

59:34.797 --> 59:36.196
Go ahead and activate
cleanup protocol

59:36.198 --> 59:38.065
on all of Alain's aliases.

59:38.067 --> 59:41.101
- But...
- He's dead. Go on.

59:51.246 --> 59:52.546
I really didn't want to put
you in the position

59:52.548 --> 59:54.181
of having to sanction the kill.

59:54.183 --> 59:55.515
Which you would have
had to have done.

59:55.517 --> 59:56.750
The buck stops with me now.

59:56.752 --> 59:58.518
I gotta make the hard calls.

59:58.520 --> 1:00:00.654
You taught me this.

1:00:00.656 --> 1:00:03.356
You're not my superior
officer anymore.

1:00:03.358 --> 1:00:05.425
Now, if that causes you any
discomfort, Jesus, I'm sorry,

1:00:05.427 --> 1:00:06.526
but get the fuck over it.

1:00:06.528 --> 1:00:07.894
This isn't like the war.

1:00:07.896 --> 1:00:10.564
There are no sides.

1:00:10.566 --> 1:00:15.168
This is business,
and it's brutal.

1:00:15.170 --> 1:00:16.937
And I know you like Ava.

1:00:16.939 --> 1:00:19.339
Wanted to spare your feelings.

1:00:19.341 --> 1:00:22.309
Rely on your understanding
afterwards, you know?

1:00:29.585 --> 1:00:31.618
What does she think happened?

1:00:31.620 --> 1:00:33.920
Let's hope she thinks
what I told her to think,

1:00:33.922 --> 1:00:36.690
that she was
attacked by a junkie.

1:00:36.692 --> 1:00:38.625
I lied to her.

1:00:38.627 --> 1:00:39.960
Good.

1:00:43.132 --> 1:00:45.799
You need to rescind
the kill order.

1:00:45.801 --> 1:00:47.768
You know I can't do that.

1:00:47.770 --> 1:00:49.836
Sure you can.

1:00:58.914 --> 1:01:00.147
Hey, what the fuck, man?

1:01:00.149 --> 1:01:01.081
Duke! Duke! I knew it was you!

1:01:01.083 --> 1:01:03.216
You did? Oh, boy.

1:01:03.218 --> 1:01:04.751
You knew it was me?

1:01:04.753 --> 1:01:06.753
Really?

1:01:06.755 --> 1:01:10.791
Hey, is it true that you are
the prettiest in your family?

1:01:10.793 --> 1:01:12.425
Yes.

1:01:12.427 --> 1:01:16.329
Is it true that you're the
smartest in your family?

1:01:16.331 --> 1:01:17.264
Yes.

1:01:17.266 --> 1:01:18.498
Your whole family?

1:01:18.500 --> 1:01:19.466
Come to Daddy, Monster.

1:01:19.468 --> 1:01:20.600
Come here.

1:01:20.602 --> 1:01:22.402
Oh my God, where's your mother?

1:01:22.404 --> 1:01:23.403
Shower.

1:01:23.405 --> 1:01:24.771
Yeah, did you sneak
out on your own?

1:01:24.773 --> 1:01:26.506
Crafty.

1:01:26.508 --> 1:01:29.910
Well, Uncle Duke's gonna have a
job for you with those skills.

1:01:29.912 --> 1:01:32.012
Oh, no, he won't.

1:01:32.014 --> 1:01:34.247
One daughter's enough?

1:01:34.249 --> 1:01:36.850
The field is no
place for a lady.

1:01:36.852 --> 1:01:40.320
I think we've established that.

1:01:43.826 --> 1:01:45.292
Say goodbye to
Uncle Duke, Monster.

1:01:45.294 --> 1:01:46.960
Bye, Uncle Duke.

1:01:46.962 --> 1:01:48.962
Bye, beautiful.

1:01:48.964 --> 1:01:50.664
All right you, get in there.

1:01:50.666 --> 1:01:52.365
Bring her out to her mother, and
don't let her back out again.

1:01:52.367 --> 1:01:54.234
Yes, sir.

1:02:44.519 --> 1:02:47.320
No! Stop! It's not
your fight, darlin'.

1:02:47.322 --> 1:02:48.822
Go on, get out of
here, leave us alone.

1:02:48.824 --> 1:02:50.490
Leave us alone!

1:04:12.674 --> 1:04:14.341
Come in.

1:04:21.483 --> 1:04:23.650
You should have stayed
at the hospital.

1:04:23.652 --> 1:04:25.785
You sure you don't want to
give it a few more days?

1:04:25.787 --> 1:04:28.421
I certainly did not want
to give it a few more days.

1:04:28.423 --> 1:04:30.023
I mean, just in case
you're not completely...

1:04:30.025 --> 1:04:31.624
Ohhh!

1:04:31.626 --> 1:04:34.094
I hate that kind of talk.

1:04:34.096 --> 1:04:37.530
You can go to hell with
your just in case garbage.

1:04:37.532 --> 1:04:40.800
Touch wood.

1:04:40.802 --> 1:04:43.036
Go on, touch wood.

1:04:44.539 --> 1:04:47.273
Both hands.

1:05:33.021 --> 1:05:34.988
Hearts.

1:05:44.900 --> 1:05:47.600
Anyone ever talk to you about
going on some OCD medication?

1:05:47.602 --> 1:05:48.701
Ha.

1:05:48.703 --> 1:05:50.937
That's what you
would like, isn't it?

1:05:50.939 --> 1:05:56.676
Drug me up and then throw
me away in the loony bin.

1:05:57.179 --> 1:05:58.912
Here we go.

1:06:00.849 --> 1:06:02.916
Ma.

1:06:05.387 --> 1:06:07.687
I have to talk to
you about something.

1:06:10.725 --> 1:06:14.461
You should choose carefully
what you tell me, Ava.

1:06:15.063 --> 1:06:16.796
'Cause you can't...

1:06:16.798 --> 1:06:20.934
un-say it, and I
can't un-hear it.

1:06:22.804 --> 1:06:27.707
And I would love to believe that
you work at the United Nations,

1:06:27.709 --> 1:06:30.110
honey, I really would.

1:06:30.112 --> 1:06:33.813
I'm sorry.

1:06:50.799 --> 1:06:55.802
I... I knew who your father
was when I married him.

1:06:56.838 --> 1:07:00.840
I didn't want to look at
that part of him, so...

1:07:00.842 --> 1:07:06.346
I focused on the half of him
that made me happy and I, uh,

1:07:06.348 --> 1:07:10.183
ignored the half of him
that broke my heart.

1:07:15.657 --> 1:07:19.926
If I'd have called him out
then for screwing around,

1:07:19.928 --> 1:07:21.694
it'd be not only
for his betrayal,

1:07:23.965 --> 1:07:26.833
it'd be because he lied
about his daughter

1:07:26.835 --> 1:07:30.170
to save his own ass, and...

1:07:30.172 --> 1:07:36.309
well, any decent mother would
have to leave the man then,

1:07:36.311 --> 1:07:39.479
right?

1:07:39.481 --> 1:07:44.450
I was scared to be alone.

1:07:47.122 --> 1:07:49.422
I chose him over you.

1:07:51.626 --> 1:07:55.361
That's why I didn't
want to talk to you.

1:07:55.997 --> 1:07:58.097
I dreaded you calling every
six months, because...

1:08:01.236 --> 1:08:03.937
you knew what I'd done.

1:08:09.844 --> 1:08:16.816
Whatever it is, whatever it
is that you've been hiding...

1:08:17.686 --> 1:08:20.119
I don't care.

1:08:20.722 --> 1:08:22.155
Because I can see
in your eyes

1:08:22.157 --> 1:08:26.726
that it's given you
a strength...

1:08:26.728 --> 1:08:30.897
You would never do
to your child...

1:08:30.899 --> 1:08:32.465
what I did to mine.

1:08:35.503 --> 1:08:39.239
I can see, you are not scared.

1:08:44.246 --> 1:08:47.146
And that...
makes me very proud.

1:08:53.888 --> 1:08:55.855
Mom.

1:08:58.193 --> 1:09:02.395
Ava, it's your turn...

1:09:02.397 --> 1:09:05.465
and I have to win so
I can get some rest.

1:09:05.467 --> 1:09:07.700
Okay? So...

1:09:38.466 --> 1:09:42.168
Day like this
reminds me of home.

1:09:42.170 --> 1:09:43.436
Does it?

1:09:43.438 --> 1:09:45.738
Yeah.

1:09:47.075 --> 1:09:49.742
And I'm going to go to Boston.

1:09:49.744 --> 1:09:51.311
Take care of Ava meself.

1:09:51.313 --> 1:09:52.679
Mm.

1:09:52.681 --> 1:09:56.249
Good luck.

1:09:56.251 --> 1:09:56.983
Is there anything you'd
like me to say to her

1:09:56.985 --> 1:09:59.152
before I put her in the earth?

1:10:01.156 --> 1:10:05.124
Well, tell her I'm sorry I
couldn't be there to watch her

1:10:05.126 --> 1:10:07.927
cut your heart out.

1:10:09.097 --> 1:10:11.097
Will do.

1:11:23.605 --> 1:11:24.704
Yep?

1:11:24.706 --> 1:11:26.873
Management Code 980456.

1:11:26.875 --> 1:11:28.408
Executive Code, please?

1:11:28.410 --> 1:11:32.879
Executive Code 74598CG.

1:11:32.881 --> 1:11:34.414
Confirmed.

1:11:34.416 --> 1:11:36.382
Who's this?

1:11:36.384 --> 1:11:38.785
Hello Ava, I'm Simon.

1:11:38.787 --> 1:11:40.620
Did Duke ever tell you about me?

1:11:45.627 --> 1:11:46.526
No?

1:11:46.528 --> 1:11:47.693
Well, I'm not surprised.

1:11:47.695 --> 1:11:48.861
I was his first protégé.

1:11:48.863 --> 1:11:52.432
Broke him in for you,
so to speak.

1:11:52.434 --> 1:11:54.367
I always said about Duke,
if he didn't teach me everything

1:11:54.369 --> 1:11:56.736
I know, he certainly taught
me all the useful shit.

1:11:56.738 --> 1:12:00.640
Well, I never fuckin' heard of
you, man, so what do you want?

1:12:00.642 --> 1:12:02.408
I just killed him...

1:12:02.410 --> 1:12:04.277
because of you.

1:12:08.216 --> 1:12:10.616
If that's true, Simon...

1:12:10.618 --> 1:12:12.652
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

1:12:14.289 --> 1:12:17.657
I imagined you'd say that.

1:12:17.659 --> 1:12:21.227
Duke asked me to tell you he's
sorry he won't be there to watch

1:12:21.229 --> 1:12:22.829
you cut out my heart.

1:13:25.627 --> 1:13:27.293
Is Judy here?

1:13:27.295 --> 1:13:29.028
No, Judy's at a gig right now.

1:13:29.030 --> 1:13:33.299
She, uh, she'll be back
at around 1:00, 1:30.

1:13:39.340 --> 1:13:40.172
Come away with me.

1:13:40.174 --> 1:13:40.873
What?

1:13:40.875 --> 1:13:42.241
Come with me.

1:13:42.243 --> 1:13:43.376
Come with you where?

1:13:43.378 --> 1:13:45.411
Uh, I don't know.

1:13:45.413 --> 1:13:48.214
Just... go away together.

1:13:48.216 --> 1:13:51.450
Go someplace nobody can find us.

1:14:00.528 --> 1:14:02.562
Judy's pregnant.

1:14:04.866 --> 1:14:07.533
We weren't even tryin'.

1:14:07.535 --> 1:14:09.235
We just found out.

1:14:45.306 --> 1:14:48.207
She's here.
Stay back.

1:17:07.014 --> 1:17:09.381
I asked Michael to
run away with me.

1:17:11.252 --> 1:17:12.918
Do you believe that, Toni?

1:17:12.920 --> 1:17:15.955
My own sister's fiancé.

1:17:17.592 --> 1:17:21.393
I didn't even think about
the consequences for Jude.

1:17:21.395 --> 1:17:24.730
I've never told anyone this...

1:17:24.732 --> 1:17:27.700
but I've been paid
to kill 41 people.

1:17:32.240 --> 1:17:36.208
And even after all that...

1:17:36.210 --> 1:17:41.046
it wasn't until I did
that to my sister...

1:17:41.048 --> 1:17:44.617
that I really knew
what I was capable of.

1:17:52.660 --> 1:17:54.426
I know my secret's
safe with you.

1:18:01.736 --> 1:18:04.003
Aaah!

1:18:29.797 --> 1:18:31.864
Now we're square.

1:18:31.866 --> 1:18:33.499
It's paid.

1:18:33.501 --> 1:18:37.636
Never, ever bother
my family again.

1:18:37.638 --> 1:18:41.173
We're done now.

1:22:17.591 --> 1:22:20.159
Simon.

1:22:20.161 --> 1:22:22.561
It's a lovely
morning for it, Ava.

1:22:22.563 --> 1:22:25.164
I see you took a
trip to the minibar.

1:22:25.166 --> 1:22:26.899
What would Duke say?

1:22:29.036 --> 1:22:31.036
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Shocking.

1:23:50.117 --> 1:23:51.283
I'm a little bit rusty.

1:24:03.597 --> 1:24:04.997
Hey, come here!

1:24:24.818 --> 1:24:25.717
You know what, Simon?

1:24:29.023 --> 1:24:30.355
Shut up, babe.

1:24:31.792 --> 1:24:33.158
Oh, that's right.

1:24:33.160 --> 1:24:36.228
You don't like it when I
talk to my subjects, do you?

1:24:38.332 --> 1:24:40.232
This time...

1:24:40.234 --> 1:24:41.733
I know what you did.

1:24:54.648 --> 1:24:56.782
Fuckin' hell.

1:25:06.060 --> 1:25:08.727
Count no man happy...

1:25:08.729 --> 1:25:10.195
Until the end is known.

1:25:10.197 --> 1:25:11.530
Yeah.

1:25:13.701 --> 1:25:16.168
Yeah, Duke made me read
all that Greek shit too.

1:25:20.741 --> 1:25:25.677
I see why he liked
you so much, Ava.

1:25:25.679 --> 1:25:27.246
You've got moxie.

1:25:42.229 --> 1:25:43.895
If I see you again, I
will fucking kill you.

1:26:27.241 --> 1:26:28.807
Go that way.

1:26:28.809 --> 1:26:30.776
Attention, hotel guests,

1:26:30.778 --> 1:26:32.811
please evacuate the building.

1:26:32.813 --> 1:26:34.980
Do not attempt to
use the elevators.

1:26:34.982 --> 1:26:37.149
Please use the stairwell.

1:26:37.151 --> 1:26:39.017
This is not a drill.

1:26:39.019 --> 1:26:41.086
Evacuate the hotel immediately.

1:27:54.661 --> 1:27:57.929
Management Code 98045FT.

1:27:57.931 --> 1:27:59.898
Put security around my
family on high alert.

1:27:59.900 --> 1:28:00.999
Double the guard detail.

1:28:02.536 --> 1:28:04.669
The object is still open.

1:29:03.664 --> 1:29:05.330
Agh!

1:29:25.319 --> 1:29:26.785
My family.

1:29:26.787 --> 1:29:29.921
I have no interest in them.

1:29:31.658 --> 1:29:36.761
I do understand that if you...

1:29:36.763 --> 1:29:40.332
...if you wanted to take
your time with this.

1:29:46.473 --> 1:29:49.774
Count of five?

1:29:50.611 --> 1:29:51.409
Why not?

1:29:56.016 --> 1:29:56.648
One.

1:30:16.737 --> 1:30:19.738
I'm here for my sister.

1:30:20.340 --> 1:30:22.040
Holy... Oh my God, get
in here, get inside.

1:30:22.676 --> 1:30:24.409
I need to talk to you alone.

1:30:25.879 --> 1:30:27.145
We're fine.

1:30:28.181 --> 1:30:29.548
We're fine.

1:30:30.717 --> 1:30:31.816
What happened?

1:30:33.086 --> 1:30:34.686
I need you to listen to me.

1:30:34.688 --> 1:30:37.188
Go get Mom and get out
of the country tonight.

1:30:37.190 --> 1:30:39.090
Just for a month or two
until I can contact you.

1:30:39.092 --> 1:30:40.025
What?

1:30:40.027 --> 1:30:41.760
Don't go to Europe or the UK.

1:30:42.095 --> 1:30:44.229
You sound crazy right now.

1:30:44.231 --> 1:30:45.730
Here's an account
number and a code for

1:30:45.732 --> 1:30:48.033
an offshore account in my name.

1:30:48.035 --> 1:30:50.068
Memorize this and
then burn it, Jude.

1:30:50.070 --> 1:30:52.337
There's $500,000 in there.

1:30:52.339 --> 1:30:54.372
Use whatever you need.

1:30:54.374 --> 1:30:56.207
Here's $20,000.

1:30:56.209 --> 1:30:58.677
This will be enough to get you
all out of the country and safe.

1:30:58.679 --> 1:31:00.045
What the fuck?

1:31:00.047 --> 1:31:01.446
Jude, come on, listen.

1:31:01.448 --> 1:31:02.914
Are you fucking listening to me?

1:31:02.916 --> 1:31:06.751
I need to you to do exactly
what I'm telling you to do.

1:31:06.753 --> 1:31:07.619
What? What is going on?

1:31:07.621 --> 1:31:09.421
Why would I do that?

1:31:09.423 --> 1:31:10.622
Because I need you to
take care of the family

1:31:10.624 --> 1:31:13.191
the way I was never able to.

1:31:13.193 --> 1:31:17.429
All right?

1:31:17.431 --> 1:31:19.197
You're a momma now.

1:31:20.233 --> 1:31:21.766
Okay?

1:31:24.938 --> 1:31:27.839
You need to take care
of your baby.

1:31:31.244 --> 1:31:34.512
I could never make him as
happy as you obviously do.

1:31:35.949 --> 1:31:38.383
This came for you.

1:31:41.888 --> 1:31:44.122
Thank you.

1:31:45.892 --> 1:31:48.193
Ava.

1:31:52.132 --> 1:31:55.166
Who are you?

1:31:55.168 --> 1:31:58.003
Nobody that you want
your child to know.

1:32:08.281 --> 1:32:12.584
Count no man as happy
until his end is known.

1:32:12.586 --> 1:32:16.688
What Simon would call
all that Greek shit.

1:32:16.690 --> 1:32:18.957
It's not until you
know how someone dies

1:32:18.959 --> 1:32:22.460
that you know what
really mattered to them.

1:32:22.462 --> 1:32:25.530
What they cared about,
what they'd sacrifice for.

1:32:25.532 --> 1:32:27.132
What they would die for.

1:32:27.134 --> 1:32:32.037
Who they loved and who
loved them in return.

1:32:32.039 --> 1:32:35.774
We don't have much
control over our lives.

1:32:35.776 --> 1:32:38.309
But our end?

1:32:38.311 --> 1:32:41.212
Sometimes we write that story.

1:32:41.214 --> 1:32:44.983
If you're getting this,
you know my end.

1:32:44.985 --> 1:32:49.621
I've never been happier.
