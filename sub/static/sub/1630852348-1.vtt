02:34.028 --> 02:38.324
Your task today is to build Ant-Man
fighting off Yellowjacket

before they get to Micro-Girl.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.499

-Technical ability.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.126
I want to see the tiny details

02:48.209 --> 02:51.671
on your build, that make Ant-Man
such a cool superhero.

02:51.754 --> 02:54.257
-Yes!
-AMIRAH: Also, storytelling, though.

02:54.382 --> 02:56.843
Where you put Ant-Man,
and how you have him

02:56.926 --> 03:01.431
interacting with his environment
can show me how creative you can truly be.

-Yep, in a picnic.
-Beautiful.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.410
-JOHN: We need an anthill definitely.
-TAI: Absolutely, anthill.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.162
-Maybe, like, an apple core?
-JOHN: We...

04:06.246 --> 04:07.830
-Apple core? Genius. Love it.
-Apple.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.298
-Okay.
-Ant-thony?

04:17.382 --> 04:18.633
Yeah! Absolutely.
We have to have Ant-thony.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.051
-Definitely Ant-thony.
-That's his boy.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.845
-Of course.
-So, Yellowjacket has stolen the journals.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.597
-LIZ: Mm-hmm.
-We wanna have those journals on a desk...

04:24.681 --> 04:25.556
-Right.
-...so you can see it.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.600
LIZ: So, this is his, like, office, right?

04:27.725 --> 04:28.851
This is Yellowjacket's office. Yeah.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.062
-His desk specifically, yeah.
-Yeah.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.480
-LIZ: Okay.
-Baker and the Beasts!

04:32.563 --> 04:34.399

04:34.524 --> 04:36.359
-I know how you two know each other.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

-Yeah.

And he's been trying to get all three
of us together for a while.

04:46.744 --> 04:48.288
-MIKE: Finally got it.
-There, you got it.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.916
Being here with my brother by my side
is really important.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.296
Yeah, how cool to be lovers of Disney
and what Disney represents,

04:56.504 --> 04:59.507
and to actually be able
to do a competition together.

04:59.674 --> 05:00.717
BENNY: So, what do you guys do?

05:00.800 --> 05:04.512
Well, I started out as a pumpkin sculptor.
And I've been doing that for, like,

05:04.595 --> 05:06.097
<i>-seven years.</i>
-LIZ:<i> Oh, you...</i>

05:06.264 --> 05:08.182
He's way more than just
a pumpkin sculptor.

05:08.266 --> 05:11.394
He has the Guinness World Record
for largest carved pumpkin.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.062
-BENNY: <i>That is amazing!</i>
-What?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.230
-MIKE: Yeah.
-LIZ: How heavy was it?

05:14.314 --> 05:18.776
-I think it was like 2,077 pounds.
-And I have a cake decorating school.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.445
-I teach people how to...
-AMIRAH: <i>Wow.</i>

05:20.528 --> 05:23.531
...make stuff like this, but on, like,
on a smaller scale. Yeah.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.074
How about the challenge? What's your plan?

05:25.199 --> 05:27.618
LIZ: <i>So this is Ant-Man battling</i>
<i>Yellowjacket here.</i>

05:27.702 --> 05:31.247
<i>The only way to portray Ant-Man</i>
<i>as Ant-Man is to make everything</i>

05:31.331 --> 05:33.374
-around him really big.
-Correct.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.960
So, Mike, in his previous life,
is an architect.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.462
So, he has really helped us

05:37.587 --> 05:41.341
kinda figure out how to build something
that is normally this big,

05:41.507 --> 05:44.385
and make it look, like,
proportionately huge.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.430
Right. I wanna see some specialty carving
going on.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.849
-Oh, boy.
-Literally, do not shy away

05:49.932 --> 05:51.476
-from what your skill is.
-Yeah.

05:51.559 --> 05:52.810
-BOTH: Yes.
-Good luck.

<i>Gelatin sheets, Jess.</i>

06:38.564 --> 06:39.982

-Grab those.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.567

06:41.651 --> 06:42.860
-JOHN: Yes.
-JESSICA: Ooh.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.362
JESSICA:<i> You know, really gets</i>
<i>you thinking,</i>

06:44.445 --> 06:46.489
like, what can we really transform
out of this?

06:46.989 --> 06:48.491
Oh, my gosh. I love that.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.493
Okay. So, I think that we should change
a couple of things.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.870
So instead of doing chocolate for the Wasp

06:52.954 --> 06:55.373
I think we should try and incorporate
some sort of other food.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.208
Because she was, like,
making a big deal

06:57.291 --> 06:58.793
-about you being a carver.
-Yeah.

06:58.876 --> 07:00.002
-So...
-MIKE: We could look at doing

07:00.086 --> 07:01.212
some stuff for the bees.

07:01.337 --> 07:05.341
So, to address what Amirah said to us,
we're trying to figure out,

07:05.425 --> 07:06.551
you know, the insects.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.719
-What about these eggplants?
-There's sweet potatoes up here.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.513
MIKE: I don't know.
I think those are too big.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.723
We need something that's solid.
That we can actually carve.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.268
-Squash?
-MIKE: Yeah, the squash would be good.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.937
KEKE: The sun is showing us, guys,
that it's still mid-morning,

07:18.104 --> 07:19.939
and there's so much work to do.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.443
Now, when it comes to Ant-Man,
scale is the whole thing.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.194
I mean, you could either go really,
really big,

07:25.278 --> 07:26.946
-or you can go really, really small.
-BENNY: Yeah,

07:27.029 --> 07:28.823
nothing matters more than proportions.

07:28.906 --> 07:32.410
When you build something
in an oversized scale,

07:32.493 --> 07:33.828
you have to measure.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.622
-So it's kind of like a math problem.
-Yeah, listen. When you create these type

07:36.706 --> 07:40.001
of designs, you have to be an engineer,
you have to be a little bit of everything.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.587

the pink.

-Dyeing the pink for the blanket.

The story and concept behind our build
is Yellowjacket and Ant-Man

kind of fall out of a helicopter
into someone's picnic.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.946

mixed up, you know,

08:09.030 --> 08:11.532

-What are you working on first, Tyler?

TAI: I'm doing... starting
on my Yellowjacket.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.578
-Oh, nice.
-I'm using a black modeling chocolate

08:15.661 --> 08:17.038
-for this guy.
-Oh, sweet.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.373
TAI: <i>But first, I built the head</i>
<i>around the LED lights,</i>

we have a squash.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.515

with modeling chocolate,

08:40.895 --> 08:44.398
because I'm gonna be
casting a huge apple core.

08:44.607 --> 08:48.402
So, I need to try and carve that out,
which means I need it to set up.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.613
Yeah, Jess.
This will be really easy to get rid

08:50.696 --> 08:52.323
of the hot glue, once it's done.

08:52.698 --> 08:53.950
-JESSICA: Thanks for doing that.
-Of course.

08:58.329 --> 09:02.166
<i>I probably won't un-mold it for at least,</i>
<i>like, four to six hours.</i>

09:02.416 --> 09:06.212
So, kind of risky,
but I feel like I can handle it.

09:07.838 --> 09:10.424
-Jess, how's it looking?
-It's looking great.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.593
-You giving him some chestuses.
-You like the body?

09:12.677 --> 09:15.221
-(CHUCKLES)
-Chest and abs and shoulders.

09:15.721 --> 09:16.973
-What a hero should have, right?
-The works.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.058
Is this Ant-Man or is this Jonathan?

09:19.684 --> 09:22.228
-(BOTH LAUGH)
-I wish it was me.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.938
AMILYE: So, I'm gonna start
with some ganache.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.731
Okay. I'm making these sprinkles,
you guys.

09:25.898 --> 09:29.986
-Elan, what are you doing?
-I am trying to get this gelatin

09:30.361 --> 09:33.322
to soak up this water,
so I can put it into the microwave.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.993
<i>Ant-Man and Ghost are gonna have, like,</i>
<i>this fight scene inside of the fridge.</i>

09:37.076 --> 09:38.578
<i>So, one thing we thought</i>
<i>would be a really good idea,</i>

09:38.661 --> 09:40.121
would be, like, to have a cracked egg

09:40.204 --> 09:43.082
on the bottom of the fridge,
like, on the flooring.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.834
AMILYE: I'm excited about this egg thing,
actually.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.544
-ELAN: I really hope it sets up, man.
-(AMILYE LAUGHING)

09:46.627 --> 09:48.045
-Like that is... I'm...
-It's going to. Wait.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.172
-...a little worried.
-Wait. (CHUCKLING)

09:50.339 --> 09:52.633
ELAN: All right, I definitely need
to make some more.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.844
LIZ: Make sure you bend that,
so that they look like real legs

09:54.969 --> 09:57.555
-'cause we want realism.
-MIKE: I mean, this is looking kinda...

09:57.680 --> 10:00.308
-kinda creepy, guys.
-LIZ: It only has six legs.

10:01.517 --> 10:02.518
Like an ant.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.229
-Right?
-So, is an ant not an insect?

10:05.313 --> 10:06.689
-MIKE: Isn't it? I don't know.
-I thought you had

10:06.814 --> 10:09.567
to have eight legs to be an insect,
or is that just to be a spider?

10:09.650 --> 10:12.069
-(CHUCKLING) I'm an architect, Liz.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

10:12.403 --> 10:13.904
Yo, Amilye, do you see who that is?

10:14.030 --> 10:17.158
-AMILYE: I've been trying not to notice.
-That's Liz Marek.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.035
-So nervous.
-ELAN: Sugar Geek.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.454
AMILYE: Are you guys talking
about the fact that Liz is over there?

10:21.537 --> 10:22.997
ELAN: Yes, like, right next to us,

10:23.205 --> 10:25.082
-we're competing against Liz.
-AMILYE: Liz Marek? Like, Liz Marek?

10:25.207 --> 10:26.459
-I'm so nervous.
-AMILYE: That's fine.

10:26.626 --> 10:30.463
Seeing Liz from across the way,
it is intimidating to say the least.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.716
If I suggest another project
with ten things made out of chocolate,

10:33.799 --> 10:36.135
just be like, no. (CHUCKLING)

10:36.218 --> 10:37.720
ELAN: <i>She's a seasoned veteran.</i>

10:37.803 --> 10:39.305
<i>We've watched her grow over the years</i>

10:39.388 --> 10:43.309
into this amazing juggernaut
of a cake artist.

10:43.559 --> 10:47.438
And us starting our own bakery
is something very new.

10:47.521 --> 10:50.983
And us jumping into this big competition
is something even newer.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.193
Like, we're the underdogs.

10:52.276 --> 10:56.030
We're new and we're doing this right next
to her, like, that's a big deal.

10:56.113 --> 10:57.782
But we still have a chance, fam,
we can do this.

10:57.948 --> 10:58.949
I think we can kill it.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.410
But knowing that that's gonna
be our competition,

11:01.786 --> 11:03.204
we have our hands full.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.665
You know what, team? As much as I'm used
to competing against you guys,

11:05.748 --> 11:07.458
I much prefer being a team, you know.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.543
TAI: This is way better.
Definitely preferred.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.672
Plus, you guys are tough competition,
I'd rather you be with me than against me.

11:12.755 --> 11:13.964
-TAI: One hundred.
-(CHUCKLES)

11:14.090 --> 11:18.636
-Our powers combined, we are The Avengers.
-JESSICA: <i>We met on a food competition.</i>

11:18.719 --> 11:21.597
We're, actually,
all going against each other.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.265
And through this competition,

11:23.349 --> 11:26.185
we actually ended up
enjoying each other's companies.

11:26.268 --> 11:28.979
<i>And also respecting</i>
<i>each other’s skill sets.</i>

11:29.063 --> 11:31.524
TAI: This is pretty early,
so everything's pretty chill.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.734
But I know that once dawn starts
to come, we're gonna be like,

11:33.818 --> 11:35.861
-"Oh, my God," and freak out. Yeah.
-JOHN: Freak out or go home.

11:36.028 --> 11:39.532
-What's up, Project Alchemy?
-What's up, Keke, how you doin' girl?

11:39.615 --> 11:42.284
So, I wanna ask you guys,
why did you pick this name?

11:42.368 --> 11:44.704
'Cause alchemists used
to take kind of, like, regular objects

11:44.787 --> 11:47.164
and try to turn them into gold.
So that's what we're trying to do

11:47.248 --> 11:48.833
with this amazing Disney build
we're doing right now.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.168
Now, what you building over here?
It looks like a little voodoo doll.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.586
TAI: No, so, this
is actually Yellowjacket

11:52.712 --> 11:53.921
-'cause you know... Yes.
-KEKE: Ooh!

11:54.004 --> 11:57.091
And then the cool thing
about this guy is that,

11:57.550 --> 11:59.969
-when you hit the switch...
-(KEKE GASPS)

12:00.052 --> 12:01.429
We're trying to go
for the whole experience, boo.

12:01.512 --> 12:05.266
<i>I paint with food. I've only been doing</i>
<i>food art for... It'll be five years now.</i>

12:05.349 --> 12:07.768
<i>I love working with sugars,</i>
<i>love working with chocolate.</i>

12:07.852 --> 12:11.230
I really just love utilizing food
as much as possible.

12:11.355 --> 12:12.773
KEKE: Make sure you keep an eye
on that sun,

12:12.857 --> 12:14.358
because you've got a lot to do.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.318
-Thank you.
-Thank you. See you later.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.821
LIZ: What is the question that people
ask you the most

12:18.988 --> 12:20.489
-when you're carving a pumpkin?
-MIKE: Really, it's...

12:20.614 --> 12:22.366
-"How long did that take?"
-Yeah, "How long did it take?"

12:22.450 --> 12:23.868
-Or "How long will it last?"
-Hmm.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.495
So, like for this, as soon
as you take that skin off,

12:26.579 --> 12:29.457
it will start rotting fast,
so we're gonna have to...

12:30.416 --> 12:31.500
keep that from happening.

12:31.584 --> 12:35.546
<i>Time is a huge factor in this competition,</i>
<i>and subtractive carving,</i>

12:35.629 --> 12:39.216
carving that you do with pumpkins
and fruits and vegetables,

12:39.300 --> 12:42.386
it takes more time
than additive sculpting.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.889
Yeah, especially large-scale,
or going into detail.

12:44.972 --> 12:48.809
MIKE: <i>Yeah. So, to address what Benny</i>
<i>and Amirah said to us</i>

12:48.893 --> 12:51.103
<i>about me being a pumpkin carver,</i>

12:51.228 --> 12:55.274
<i>the Wasp head is pretty simple.</i>
<i>So, the head, the pincers,</i>

12:55.357 --> 12:58.402
<i>is something that can be created</i>
<i>with a butternut squash.</i>

12:58.527 --> 13:00.154
-Liz...
-LIZ: Oh, you did it!

13:00.237 --> 13:02.490
-Did it. What do you think?
-LIZ: How did you do that?

13:02.948 --> 13:04.909
-Magic.
-BOTH: Twin magic.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.035
(LIZ LAUGHING)

13:06.243 --> 13:10.039
MIKE: <i>Our whole team approach</i>
<i>is to create characters</i>

13:10.122 --> 13:13.250
<i>that are realistic. And as an architect,</i>
<i>that's what I do.</i>

13:13.375 --> 13:15.336
<i>I mean, I'm creating</i>
<i>three-dimensional spaces</i>

13:15.419 --> 13:16.796
<i>for people to interact with.</i>

13:17.379 --> 13:19.048
AMILYE: How's the cupcake going?

13:19.590 --> 13:23.302
ELAN: I mean, it's coming along.
Once I get to the middle,

13:23.385 --> 13:26.013
I think it should be pretty easy,
pretty quick.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.058
AMILYE: <i>We decided to incorporate</i>
<i>more baked goods</i>

13:29.141 --> 13:30.684
-into the fridge 'cause like...
-We're a bakery.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.062
-...that's what we are. Yeah.
-Definitely representing who we are.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.772
-Yes.
-Yeah, but when you think

13:34.897 --> 13:38.692
<i>about little details,</i>
<i>sometimes it's easier on a smaller scale.</i>

13:38.818 --> 13:40.861
But when it's literally the size
of yourself

13:40.986 --> 13:43.155
I don't even know what to say about it.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.406
-FEMALE VOICE: Ready?
-Yeah.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.451
-FEMALE VOICE: One, two, three.
-ELAN: <i>It is very intimidating.</i>

13:47.535 --> 13:48.994
-FEMALE VOICE: I'm tilting it.
-ELAN: Okay. Okay.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.456
Ooh! I really need
to start working out. This is crazy.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.750
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

13:55.501 --> 13:59.797
ELAN: This is a very rough sculpt.
Just wanna let you know.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.383
Just don't even look at this cake then.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.719
ELAN: <i>One of my specialties</i>
<i>has always been sculpting,</i>

14:05.803 --> 14:08.055
<i>and in terms of scale of,</i>
<i>like, our cupcake,</i>

14:08.180 --> 14:09.640
<i>we're not getting that right.</i>

14:09.765 --> 14:12.935
-It's a little weird.
-Yeah, it's a little wonky.

14:13.102 --> 14:17.439
AMILYE: I think we just need to go.
Like, we haven't even started on Ant-Man.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.733
(EXHALES HEAVILY)

14:20.609 --> 14:22.611
-(MILD-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING)
-KEKE: I am so excited.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.780
So, you guys went around,
been talking to some of the teams, yeah?

14:24.905 --> 14:26.323
-AMIRAH: Oh, you should be excited.
-BENNY: Yeah.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.700
-Oh, my gosh.
-(AMIRAH CHUCKLING)

14:27.783 --> 14:30.494
Let's start with Baker and the Beasts.
What are your first thoughts?

14:30.619 --> 14:31.829
AMIRAH: They have just such a unique team.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.623
I mean, they have
a professional pumpkin carver.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.959
BENNY: But I haven't seen the skill, like,

14:37.084 --> 14:39.420
if you have an awesome sculptor like
this guy,

14:39.587 --> 14:40.921
I will expect to see more details.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.007
AMIRAH: I'm hoping
that maybe they're going large-scale,

14:43.090 --> 14:45.092
and then he's gonna come in
with the details.

14:45.175 --> 14:48.095
Yeah, yeah. Now, I'm so excited
to talk about Crumb Coat,

14:48.178 --> 14:49.763
because we've got a whole lady gang.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.432
-Oh, yeah.
-That's really, really cool.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.351
AMIRAH: Yeah. And you know,
they're inside of a refrigerator.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.145
That's such a unique perspective.

14:56.228 --> 15:00.065
I can't wait to see what colors
they're using for a cake slice,

15:00.149 --> 15:01.483
for a cupcake, macaroons, cookies.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.902
ELAN: How you doing on the back
of that cake?

15:02.985 --> 15:04.403
AMIRAH: Two of them have started
their own bakery.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.531
And I love that they've really pulled
their experience, their lives.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.074
-KEKE: Yes.
-And I can relate to this.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.911
I mean, if someone came in
and attacked my bakery before it opened,

15:12.077 --> 15:13.329
-it's actually crazy.
-(ALL LAUGH)

15:13.495 --> 15:15.372
-JOHN: How's it going, team?
-BOTH: Good.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.167
AMIRAH: Project Alchemy continues
on this apple core.

15:18.250 --> 15:23.297
I'm having a very difficult time
visualizing their entire concept.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.049
JOHN: I feel like this arm
is a little long.

15:25.382 --> 15:28.302
They're planning to sculpt
such a big chocolate piece.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.095
They basically melt the chocolate,

15:30.262 --> 15:33.599
and then just put it
into this container. It's not set.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.517
-KEKE: Yeah.
-I'm worried about how long

15:35.601 --> 15:38.479
that's gonna take.
Maybe at some point,

15:38.562 --> 15:40.648
they're just gonna start putting
all the pieces together and surprise us.

15:40.814 --> 15:42.399
-Yeah, I'm very excited for...
-But, you know, but...

15:42.524 --> 15:44.944
-...that puzzle to come together.
-Yeah, so am I.

(GRUNTS)

15:56.038 --> 15:59.166
(CHUCKLES) See? We got this,
I think we're good.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.876
NARRATOR: <i>You know Ant-Man</i>
<i>would find something better</i>

16:01.085 --> 16:02.294
<i>than a pencil to defend himself.</i>

16:02.378 --> 16:05.714
Okay, you know what? I think it's cool
that you and Ant-Man are, like, BFFs

16:05.798 --> 16:07.716
and everything, but you gotta chill
with all the name-dropping.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.303
NARRATOR: <i>I never said Ant-Man is my BFF.</i>
<i>But he did just send me a follow request.</i>

16:11.470 --> 16:12.721
<i>-So...</i>
-I know. And did you see

16:12.805 --> 16:15.140
that Sonny Burch liked that picture of us
from last weekend?

16:15.224 --> 16:16.600
-NARRATOR:<i> Mm-hmm.</i>
-He cannot take a hint...

16:16.684 --> 16:19.019
NARRATOR: <i>Yeah, let's back-burner that</i>
<i>for the time being,</i>

16:19.103 --> 16:20.521
<i>and instead make a call for some backup.</i>

16:20.604 --> 16:22.815
Oh, go ahead. Name drop,
you know you wanna.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.608
NARRATOR: <i>Thanks.</i>
<i>I'm gonna get the Wasp here.</i>

16:24.692 --> 16:26.860
Oh, I love her. Yes!

16:27.611 --> 16:28.946
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

16:34.493 --> 16:38.163
All right, artists.
Listen up, the plot has thickened.

16:38.497 --> 16:42.251
-It's time to add to your build.
-Oh, gosh.

16:42.501 --> 16:46.422
It's time for the Wasp
to make her grand entrance.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.383
I hope this added element
doesn't make your problems

16:49.466 --> 16:50.592
too big to handle.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.636
-Good luck.
-Oh, my God.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.013
ELAN:<i> I can't handle this.</i>

16:54.221 --> 16:57.891
We now have to add the Wasp,
which is actually a little stressful

16:58.058 --> 17:00.519
<i>because we are really struggling</i>
<i>on time anyways.</i>

17:00.686 --> 17:01.729
Run!

17:03.564 --> 17:05.190
I thought, "Oh, my gosh, I love the Wasp."

17:05.315 --> 17:07.484
And then I went,
"Oh, no. I gotta make the Wasp."

17:07.693 --> 17:10.029
I'm thinking about, you know,
making her small, obviously.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.321
MIKE: Really small.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.241
Can you use, like, skin from an orange
or something?

17:14.450 --> 17:16.243
-ELAN: What about something like this?
-AMILYE: For her what?

17:16.869 --> 17:18.037
-For her body.
-Body.

-All the rest of our figurines are so big.
-Yeah.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.004
LIZ: This is almost like
what her front looks like, right?

17:27.296 --> 17:29.339
Oh, lots of different cereal, by the way,
too.

17:29.506 --> 17:31.008
MATT: Right?
We're gonna use all the cereals.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.469
LIZ: I mean, we have such a solid story,
I don't want it to be like,

17:33.552 --> 17:36.555
-"Why is she here?" You know?
-Okay. Game plan?

17:37.973 --> 17:39.016
What are you thinking?

17:39.391 --> 17:43.270
MIKE: We already have Yellowjacket
shooting lasers at Ant-Man.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.982
<i>We could position her in a way</i>
<i>where he's maybe shot...</i>

17:47.066 --> 17:48.734
-LIZ: <i>Okay, okay.</i>
<i>-...towards her and then missed her.</i>

17:49.026 --> 17:50.903
TAI: I don't think we have enough time
to do a full body, John.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.362
-JOHN: That's a lot of work.
-TAI: Yeah.

17:52.529 --> 17:54.406
So we're gonna have to do
like half a body or like a head and...

17:54.490 --> 17:56.241
JOHN: I mean, look how long it took me
and Tai to do our guys.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.868
-JESSICA: <i>Of course.</i>
-TAI:<i> And we still have to finish him up.</i>

17:57.993 --> 18:01.538
What if, like, she somehow got,
like, stuck?

18:01.789 --> 18:04.750
JOHN: <i>Yeah, what about if we do</i>
<i>the cheese and she's in it,</i>

18:04.833 --> 18:06.710
<i>and she's trying to get out.</i>
<i>So half her body...</i>

18:06.835 --> 18:08.837
-TAI: Out of one of the little...
-JESSICA: Yeah. Like, she's, like...

18:08.962 --> 18:10.339
-Yeah.
-...in motion.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.382
I'm kind of looking at our platform,

18:12.466 --> 18:14.802
and we still need to put the blades
of grass up,

18:14.927 --> 18:16.095
<i>we still need to add all the dirt.</i>

18:16.178 --> 18:18.931
And of course, like, we have all
of our projects everywhere. (CHUCKLES)

18:19.014 --> 18:21.683
And then looking around,
and everybody's structures

18:21.767 --> 18:24.103
<i>are all built up, and we're the only ones</i>
<i>with nothing.</i>

18:24.520 --> 18:25.771
We've got a lot of work to do. (LAUGHS)

18:25.854 --> 18:26.939
-Absolutely.
-A ton of work.

18:27.064 --> 18:32.236
The day is getting shorter. Don't forget,
you only have until sunset to finish up.

18:32.402 --> 18:33.570
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

18:34.863 --> 18:37.491
Why don't we put her...
She's coming out of something?

18:37.908 --> 18:39.701
-ELAN: Okay.
-Then we don't have to do the whole body.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.870
-Yeah. She's kind of like...
-FEMALE VOICE: Perfect.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.539
Do you wanna bottom shelf or top shelf?

18:44.039 --> 18:46.583
I feel like maybe we should do top shelf,
just because Ant-Man is up there,

18:46.667 --> 18:47.793
she's gonna be helping Ant-Man.

18:47.876 --> 18:50.671
<i>-So, maybe inside of the s'more square.</i>
-FEMALE VOICE:<i> Yeah.</i>

18:50.796 --> 18:52.422
<i>-We gotta make it... Yeah, yeah.</i>
-AMILYE:<i> We can shove her</i>

18:52.506 --> 18:54.341
<i>in the marshmallow fluff.</i>

18:54.716 --> 18:58.637
There's so many components
to doing a large-scale build like this.

18:58.887 --> 19:01.014
<i>So, I'm gonna start the Wasp later.</i>

19:01.140 --> 19:04.643
Let's just focus on this body.
That's number one, we have to finish that.

19:08.814 --> 19:12.776
LIZ: <i>I decided to make the Wasp's body</i>
<i>based off of a little pepper,</i>

19:12.860 --> 19:16.029
<i>so that's gonna be her gold armor.</i>
<i>And then I'm gonna put modeling chocolate</i>

19:16.280 --> 19:17.406
<i>all around the rest of her armor.</i>

19:17.489 --> 19:18.949
KEKE: How's it going,
Baker and the Beasts?

19:19.032 --> 19:20.367
Hey! How's it going?

19:20.659 --> 19:24.079
You guys have to now add the Wasp.
How are you feeling about that?

19:24.163 --> 19:27.249
-How's that working into your plans?
-Well, first, we were like, you know,

19:27.332 --> 19:30.919
"Oh, my gosh." (CHUCKLES) But then,
after talking about working her in,

19:31.003 --> 19:32.880
we actually think it's gonna make
our story better.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.715
-So, I mean...
-Ooh, I like that.

19:34.798 --> 19:37.593
...we went from like, "Oh, no" to like,
"Okay, all right."

19:37.676 --> 19:38.844
So we're back up here again.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.262
-Well, good luck, good luck.
-Thanks, guys.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.139
Go ahead, get back at work.
Wishing you the best.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.143
I'm gonna go get some wire real quick
to make some wings real fast.

19:48.812 --> 19:52.816
LIZ: <i>So, I'm going to make gelatin wings</i>
<i>for all of the wasps.</i>

19:53.233 --> 19:54.484
So, it's just gelatin?

19:54.693 --> 19:58.071
It's gelatin and glycerin,
so that it doesn't get too brittle.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.490
-'Cause gelatin is just like plastic...
-Okay. Yeah.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.160
...basically. We want it
to be a little bit more flexible.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.162
MIKE: So, have you done this before?
Like, this technique?

20:05.370 --> 20:07.831
-Not like this big.
-You think... it's gonna work?

20:08.081 --> 20:09.958
-(MIKE CHUCKLING)
-LIZ: You know me, I like to innovate.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.210
Now's the time to do it, right?

20:12.961 --> 20:15.881
-What are guys making over there?
-LIZ: Oh, you know, my worst nightmare.

20:15.964 --> 20:17.424
-(ALL LAUGH)
-That's your worst nightmare?

20:17.549 --> 20:19.218
LIZ: No, it's gonna be a giant donut.

20:19.343 --> 20:23.096
MIKE: <i>The donut is two layers.</i>
<i>It's gonna be made of rice cereal treats,</i>

20:23.555 --> 20:26.433
<i>and then the top layer</i>
<i>is gonna be made of cake.</i>

20:26.600 --> 20:29.478
-You have a template?
-MATT: No, I'm just winging it.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.188
MIKE: We'll stack it out further.

20:32.272 --> 20:33.857
-MATT: Like this?
-No. I think it will be a lot faster

20:34.024 --> 20:35.567
to go the other way.
Why don't you just trim the...

20:35.651 --> 20:37.110
Is it supposed to be off-center?

20:37.444 --> 20:38.737
-MIKE: Yeah.
-Okay.

20:39.363 --> 20:41.615
LIZ: This is gonna be really thin
once we carve it down.

20:41.823 --> 20:44.284
We're stacking cake on the top.
So the cake's really heavy,

20:44.368 --> 20:47.079
and we have to have good support,
but we don't have enough room

20:47.162 --> 20:48.664
around the bottom for our rice cereal.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.582
-Rice cereal is not super stable.
-Yeah.

20:50.707 --> 20:53.710
So as soon as we start getting thin,
it's just gonna wanna, like, collapse.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.755
-So, you wanna use a full sheet?
-LIZ: It should be at least half.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.216
MIKE: This is half, longways.
So you're saying half short ways?

20:59.299 --> 21:03.553
I mean, filling half of the donut,
so it has more stability.

21:04.346 --> 21:07.516
Yeah, but for speed, we're gonna need
to just... Probably use a full sheet.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.143
<i>This is gonna take forever</i>

21:11.270 --> 21:13.689
LIZ:<i> Competition is really</i>
<i>about competing with yourself.</i>

21:13.772 --> 21:16.608
<i>When we have changes</i>
<i>that hit our team, we immediately go</i>

21:17.067 --> 21:18.527
<i>into problem solving mode.</i>

21:18.610 --> 21:21.947
We don't waste any energy on,
"Well, I wanted to do this,"

21:22.030 --> 21:23.865
or "This isn't fair."
And it's just like...

21:23.949 --> 21:27.077
No, let's figure out the solution.
Let's make it even better.

21:27.160 --> 21:30.664
<i>-Just that good attitude helps a lot.</i>
-Oh, my gosh, it's a donut.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.125
-LIZ: You okay? Sorry, it's stressful.
-MIKE: Yeah.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.002
-I just wanna make sure it works.
-Mm-hmm.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.672
We have our Baker and the Beasts,

21:38.755 --> 21:41.008
who are working on a donut
that seems to be,

21:41.133 --> 21:44.803
like it's gonna be about three
to four thousand pounds of cake.

21:44.886 --> 21:47.055
I mean, that thing is one heavy donut.

21:47.180 --> 21:50.892
I just hope they're using a very set
and dense cake

21:51.268 --> 21:55.439
that is able to support the amount
of layers they're stacking together.

21:55.522 --> 21:58.317
I'm hoping that structure
is strong enough to hold

21:58.483 --> 21:59.526
-that donut.
-BENNY: It seems...

22:01.194 --> 22:03.363
LIZ: Matt, what color pink did you get?

22:04.239 --> 22:05.574
I have soft pink.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.534
-LIZ: Do electric pink, please.
-MATT: Electric pink.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.161
-I'll change it.
-LIZ: Soft pink gets kinda orange.

22:11.079 --> 22:13.415
It reminds me of, like, being a kid

22:13.498 --> 22:16.335
and you lay in the inner tubes,
and go down the river.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.086
Gonna hit me with a jawbreaker, Liz?

22:18.587 --> 22:20.172
-LIZ: Work faster.
-(MIKE LAUGHING)

22:22.632 --> 22:24.885
KEKE: What's going on, Project Alchemy?

22:24.968 --> 22:28.472
Now I see you've been making these leaves
for hours. Is that what they are? Leaves?

22:28.597 --> 22:30.640
-Grass! Blades of grass.
-They're grass.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.351
-Yes.
-And so you can create the picnic

22:32.434 --> 22:34.519
out of the grass. And what are you
about to do, Jonathan?

22:34.603 --> 22:38.106
I'm making a Cola can. It's gonna have
cola spilling out into a puddle,

22:38.190 --> 22:40.192
and she's making these cool
raindrop cakes.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.986
It needs to be 30 inches high to be true

22:43.236 --> 22:45.822
to 15 times the size of a can of cola.
So...

22:45.906 --> 22:49.076
Oh, my gosh. Now, this is so cool.
Enjoy, guys. Good luck.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.285
-Thank you.
-TAI: Thank you, Keke.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.662
JESSICA: All right... (GRUNTS)
...it's time to get messy.

22:54.706 --> 22:59.044
JESSICA: <i>So, to make the anthill,</i>
<i>there's this whole internet phenomenon,</i>

22:59.252 --> 23:02.297
<i>fixing things with ramen,</i>
<i>and I've been obsessed with it.</i>

23:02.464 --> 23:04.841
And so, I'm actually gonna be using
this for my anthill

23:04.925 --> 23:06.843
because it has, like, great texture to it.

23:07.427 --> 23:10.263
<i>Just like with bricks and cement,</i>
<i>I'm gonna shellac</i>

23:10.347 --> 23:13.767
<i>some of my edible glue</i>
<i>with the ramen and press it on,</i>

23:13.850 --> 23:17.187
and then we'll be dousing it
in a bunch of chocolate.

23:17.479 --> 23:18.855
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

23:31.159 --> 23:32.160
The moment of truth.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.663
Project Alchemy is starting
to take the chocolate out.

23:35.622 --> 23:39.000
-There you go.
-(IN SPANISH)

23:42.379 --> 23:44.047
-Yes. Hulk out!
<i>-Hallelujah!</i>

23:44.214 --> 23:45.632
Got you. Here, I'll hold it open.

23:46.633 --> 23:47.717
Good.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.761
-Got you.
-(IN SPANISH)

23:51.263 --> 23:52.722
-(JOHN GRUNTING)
-(CHUCKLES)

23:53.348 --> 23:57.936
I'm working on a huge apple core.
I need to create this silhouette shape.

23:58.019 --> 24:00.063
<i>Because, you know,</i>
<i>when you're eating an apple,</i>

24:00.230 --> 24:03.984
you have, like, the top intact,
and then you're attacking the insides.

24:04.151 --> 24:07.821
<i>So, I'm kind of just chipping away.</i>
<i>I would rather take my time</i>

24:08.363 --> 24:12.909
than to accidentally crack it and break
all of the work that I had already done.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.077
(GRUNTS) Mm.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.876
Please don't fall off.
For the love of God, I'm praying.

24:21.293 --> 24:24.254
ELAN: <i>We don't have that much time left.</i>
<i>We gotta get all these details on.</i>

24:24.671 --> 24:27.466
We still have this entire
Wasp figurine to do.

24:27.632 --> 24:31.511
You're still working on the guy up there,
like, these are the two, like, main pieces

24:31.595 --> 24:34.556
that really have to, like,
look as realistic as humanly possible.

24:34.681 --> 24:35.974
FEMALE VOICE: That's right.

24:36.057 --> 24:37.058
I'm freaking out.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.686
AMIRAH: Looking up at that sun,
and it's already telling us

24:39.853 --> 24:42.022
that it's gonna get dark very soon.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.441
AMIRAH: We have the Crumb Coat girls
over here.

24:44.524 --> 24:45.984
They're working on their characters,

24:46.067 --> 24:48.945
which you know is so important
to keep it realistic

24:49.029 --> 24:50.030
-to the movie.
-Correct.

24:50.197 --> 24:53.033
Okay, Amilye, after I finish these gloves,
I'm gonna hop over

24:53.116 --> 24:55.118
and do the Wasp real quick.

24:55.202 --> 24:58.705
We have so much to do,
and we have no time to do it in.

24:58.788 --> 25:00.123
Look at the Baker and the Beasts.

25:00.749 --> 25:01.958
-LIZ: Can you do me a favor?
-MIKE: Yeah.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.920
Just hold underneath his head,
so I can push down

25:05.003 --> 25:07.339
without making him wobble so much?
I'm afraid it'll snap.

25:07.464 --> 25:08.798
AMIRAH: It's all about balance here.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.384
Correct.
They have to be completely careful,

25:11.468 --> 25:13.595
because you're working
with two different pieces

25:13.762 --> 25:15.555
within one structure support.

25:15.805 --> 25:17.766
LIZ: I just didn't cover his head
in modeling chocolate

25:17.849 --> 25:19.768
because his head's getting really heavy.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.478
-BENNY: That particular piece...
-AMIRAH: Stunning.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.396
...looks perfectly sculpted.

25:23.855 --> 25:27.025
If they drop that, I mean,
it's the main character.

25:27.234 --> 25:28.777
AMIRAH: I just hope it stays up.

25:29.819 --> 25:32.489
But speaking of heavy,
we have Project Alchemy,

25:32.822 --> 25:37.244
who is making really, really heavy pieces
of grass out of pastillage,

25:37.327 --> 25:39.204
and they're attached to a rod.

25:39.412 --> 25:42.666
And I don't know, but screwing in a rod
into a wood structure

25:42.749 --> 25:44.167
with such a fragile sugar...

25:44.501 --> 25:47.212
I'm just really hoping
that they don't start to chip away

25:47.337 --> 25:48.838
too much at their grass.

25:49.172 --> 25:51.091
(IN SPANISH)

25:53.468 --> 25:54.469
KEKE: Food artists...

25:55.387 --> 25:57.347
look up in the sky.

25:57.973 --> 26:01.518
It's almost sunset. I know you're all
working with small designs,

26:01.601 --> 26:05.522
but if you're not done in an hour
you're going to be cut down to size.

26:05.897 --> 26:07.566
-What else do we have to do?
-TAI: A lot.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.193
-We're gonna have to hurry really quick.
-(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

26:13.989 --> 26:17.826
All right, guys. Wasp is almost done.
I just gotta put these wings on her.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.619
-JESSICA: Perfect.
-And she'll be ready

26:19.703 --> 26:20.787
to go into the cheese.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.080
-JESSICA: All right.
-JOHN: Okay.

26:22.163 --> 26:24.040
I think the diversity of mediums
is extremely important.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.835
<i>We have a lot of really cool things.</i>
<i>For, like, our soil,</i>

26:26.918 --> 26:29.796
<i>quinoa and like puff rice,</i>
<i>chocolate, like, pebbles</i>

26:29.879 --> 26:31.756
<i>and stones and stuff since we're outside.</i>

26:31.840 --> 26:35.427
Okay, guys. I know that the time
is coming close.

26:35.510 --> 26:38.096
I'm finally getting around to working
on Wasp.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.598
-FEMALE VOICE: Nice.
-ELAN: Yes.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.933
Since all of the other figurines
are so large,

26:42.017 --> 26:44.978
I'm doing her teeny tiny.
And making her out of a hot pepper.

26:45.061 --> 26:48.356
The sun is starting to set.
We have so much to do.

26:48.481 --> 26:51.067
Can we put a cracked egg just right there?

26:51.610 --> 26:52.652
FEMALE VOICE: Yep.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.864
But at the end of the day, we're artists.
And we came here with, like,

26:55.947 --> 26:57.032
a mission and a goal.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.784
ELAN: <i>Make it messy.</i>
<i>Make it so she actually looks like</i>

26:59.868 --> 27:02.078
<i>she's slamming into a slice of cake.</i>

27:02.495 --> 27:05.707
We have to complete this build
and we have to accomplish our goal.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.209
And that's finishing,
and just being able to stand

27:08.418 --> 27:10.962
next to our competitors.
And I think that we can do that.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.756
ELAN: This is actually very therapeutic.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.636
Yeah, move over. Start painting fast.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.846
-LIZ: We gotta put her on there.
-MIKE: Go fast.

27:19.929 --> 27:22.265
-MATT: Mike, I'm trying, man.
-It's all right, it's all right.

27:22.349 --> 27:25.435
I do get a little bossy
when I'm under stress.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.395
Don't freak out now.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.273
Don't panic now? Wait, you've been
panicking the whole time.

27:30.398 --> 27:31.399
I always panic.

27:31.524 --> 27:32.817
We all understand each other,
so it's fine.

27:32.901 --> 27:33.985
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.945
LIZ: How about one person paints,
and the other person

27:36.029 --> 27:37.572
starts putting stuff on the thing?

27:38.865 --> 27:40.867
I feel like this is that part
in the action movie

27:40.950 --> 27:42.494
where you're just waiting.
Are they gonna make it?

27:42.577 --> 27:44.079
Is the superhero moment gonna happen?

27:44.287 --> 27:46.164
-Is Thanos gonna come and kill us?
-Yes!

27:46.456 --> 27:49.793
ELAN: Girl, I'm two seconds away from,
like, breaking. (CHUCKLING)

27:54.631 --> 27:56.174
MATT: Hey, guys, I'm starting to work
on the eraser.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.093
-LIZ: Oh!
-With the ham.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.011
-Pretty good color, right?
-(CHUCKLES)

28:00.136 --> 28:01.721
-MIKE: Looks like an eraser.
-JESSICA: Is it cracking?

28:01.846 --> 28:03.306
JOHN: I already fixed the crack.
There was a crack.

28:03.431 --> 28:04.683
Okay, just wrap it over it

28:04.766 --> 28:06.267
-and just squish it.
-Wrap it? All right.

28:11.690 --> 28:15.276
This is the point where they just have
to rush and put those last minute details.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.533
Forgot his...

28:24.953 --> 28:26.037
JOHN: Grass, grass, grass.

28:28.581 --> 28:30.667
-KEKE: Three.
-Just put it down.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.585
-Two.
-Plug.. plug that up.

28:32.669 --> 28:36.881
-One! And that's it. Sun down, time is up!
-(CHEERS)

28:38.258 --> 28:40.677
-Great job. Great, great job.
-TAI: Good job, guys.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.929
KEKE: It's time to show us
what you've got.

28:44.764 --> 28:47.434
-What's up, Baker and the Beasts?
-Hi!

28:47.600 --> 28:49.853
So, Mike and Matt, please tell me,
how was it?

28:50.019 --> 28:52.355
We've worked together on so many projects,

28:52.689 --> 28:55.900
and this was just something that I knew
we would do well with.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.569
And it was lot of fun.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.738
-No fights between brothers?
-MIKE: No.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.657
-They got a little tense, but...
-BENNY: See.

29:02.782 --> 29:03.867
(ALL LAUGH)

29:03.992 --> 29:06.035
Well, walk us
through this beautiful build.

29:06.202 --> 29:07.412
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

29:10.081 --> 29:15.170
LIZ: <i>So, the story of our piece</i>
<i>is Darren Cross has stolen the technology</i>

29:15.253 --> 29:18.798
<i>from Dr. Pym. He's using it</i>
<i>to control wasps.</i>

29:18.965 --> 29:23.178
<i>Ant-Man's like, "I'm gonna stop you</i>
<i>before you can get to Micro-Girl."</i>

29:24.012 --> 29:27.265
<i>The wings, it's a mixture</i>
<i>of gelatin and glycerin.</i>

29:27.348 --> 29:29.476
<i>So it's strong, but still flexible.</i>

29:29.684 --> 29:32.228
MIKE: <i>The heads for the wasps</i>
<i>were vegetables,</i>

29:32.604 --> 29:34.647
<i>some butternut squash, some avocados.</i>

29:35.732 --> 29:37.609
MATT: <i>The ants, they're made of chocolate.</i>

29:38.526 --> 29:41.696
MIKE: <i>The donut is rice cereal treats</i>
<i>and cake.</i>

29:43.323 --> 29:46.034
This really looks like action in motion.

29:46.201 --> 29:49.537
And even the Wasp. These wings, I mean,
who's not cheering for her?

29:51.623 --> 29:56.211
You do bring a very colorful desk.
You chose to use a vibrant pink.

29:56.294 --> 29:59.088
<i>You chose to incorporate</i>
<i>the eraser and the pencil to sort</i>

29:59.172 --> 30:02.675
of create that pop of color.
I personally would have probably put

30:03.009 --> 30:05.553
the blue book or a green book on top.

30:05.929 --> 30:08.807
<i>Because Yellowjacket and his wasps,</i>

30:09.015 --> 30:11.351
<i>they're getting a little bit lost</i>
<i>on the orange.</i>

30:11.643 --> 30:12.936
<i>They would have really popped</i>

30:13.144 --> 30:14.979
<i>if they were on that blue</i>
<i>or on that green.</i>

30:15.146 --> 30:19.901
But overall, I think that you did
an amazing job in incorporating vibrancy,

30:20.109 --> 30:21.528
<i>and not only that, but shading.</i>

30:21.820 --> 30:23.947
Now, there are a lot
of different things going on here.

30:24.030 --> 30:26.032
What do you feel about the skill
that's been displayed?

30:27.200 --> 30:29.911
BENNY: <i>I love the piece, guys.</i>
<i>It just tells the story.</i>

30:29.994 --> 30:33.998
Specifically for me, this space here,
it screams Marvel.

30:35.834 --> 30:39.337
Ant-Man is on point.
The colors, the textures,

30:39.629 --> 30:42.799

<i>you can even see the wrinkles</i>

<i>of his costume well placed.</i>

30:45.969 --> 30:49.931
<i>I am really, really impressed</i>
<i>in the way that you guys were able</i>

30:50.014 --> 30:51.724
<i>to balance the paperclip.</i>

30:53.101 --> 30:55.395
And I know we have an amazing carver here.

30:56.396 --> 30:59.566
Yes. Can you take me again
through the carving work that you did

30:59.691 --> 31:02.402
-through the piece?
-We have a ham eraser...

31:02.485 --> 31:04.028

<i>Working on the chocolate as well</i>
<i>on the ants and sculpting the ants.</i>

31:08.825 --> 31:12.537
But primarily, it was squash heads
for the wasps.

31:13.246 --> 31:17.417
I would have loved to see a little bit
more of your skills on the piece.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.962
-Because I know you're great in that.
-Specifically on a pencil.

31:21.337 --> 31:24.007
<i>Because a pencil has such</i>
<i>a specific shape.</i>

31:25.049 --> 31:27.760
In terms of skill,
I think they took the time

31:27.844 --> 31:31.389
to make sure that the scales
on each element was right.

31:31.472 --> 31:33.516
You're smiling, Mike.
Is that 100 percent true?

31:33.683 --> 31:35.977
-Architect. So, you know... (LAUGHS)
-He's an architect.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.145
He literally was like,

31:37.228 --> 31:39.689
"So the ants are
exactly one and a half feet long."

31:39.772 --> 31:41.566
-(LAUGHS)
-You're like, "Okay." (CHUCKLES)

31:41.649 --> 31:43.276
Well, I wanna thank you so much,
Baker and the Beasts.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.737
It was so much fun hanging with you guys.
Happy about your build.

31:45.820 --> 31:46.905
-I hope you are, too.
-Yeah, we are.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.239
-Oh, yeah.
-And wishing you the best of luck,

31:48.323 --> 31:49.991
-all right?
-AMIRAH: Thank you so much, you guys.

-KEKE: Hi, hello!

31:52.285 --> 31:57.582
-Okay. This is absolutely beautiful.
-ALL: Thank you.

31:57.665 --> 32:00.752
But before we get into the build,
I wanna ask you guys, how do you feel?

32:00.960 --> 32:02.045
-Relieved.
-Yes!

32:02.170 --> 32:05.757
We were down to the last minute.
But we figured it out.

32:05.965 --> 32:09.344
KEKE: Well, now the fun part. Walk us
through the story of your foodscape.

32:09.552 --> 32:11.095
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

ELAN: <i>Basically, they're supposed</i>
<i>to be inside a fridge.</i>

32:16.935 --> 32:19.729
<i>Because Ghost is looking</i>
<i>for her healing particles,</i>

32:19.979 --> 32:22.398
which are actually found
in the mobile lab.

32:22.732 --> 32:27.111
So they're frantically fighting to find
this lab in all of these baked goods

32:27.195 --> 32:30.657
<i>all over the place. Little do they know,</i>
<i>it's actually in the cupcake.</i>

32:32.867 --> 32:37.038
<i>For this cookie, it was actually sculpted</i>
<i>underneath with ramen</i>

32:37.121 --> 32:38.456
<i>topped with peanut butter.</i>

32:39.248 --> 32:41.417
The cake itself, the actual layers,
they're fondant

32:41.918 --> 32:43.962
<i>texturized with crumpled up foil.</i>

32:44.128 --> 32:48.925
<i>And then Ant-Man and Ghost are made out</i>
<i>of cake, Rice Krispies, fondant.</i>

32:50.551 --> 32:54.722
This is amazing. I mean, I love the eggs.
Can you tell me how you make that egg?

32:54.806 --> 32:59.227
Yeah, that was actually a jelly egg.
I had actually gotten the idea from Liz.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.688
-(ELAN CHUCKLING)
-BENNY: Oh, stolen idea.

33:01.854 --> 33:03.314
-I had taken...
-AMIRAH: Inspired. Inspired.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.608
Inspired. Exactly. (CHUCKLES)

33:05.775 --> 33:07.402
KEKE: Amirah, what are your thoughts
on the story?

33:07.652 --> 33:10.863
When I walk up to this, at a glance,
there is just no question.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.782
I'm looking into a bakery fridge.

33:14.075 --> 33:17.704
<i>I love that you guys took something</i>
<i>so personal to the three of you.</i>

33:17.912 --> 33:19.247
But working it in with

33:19.330 --> 33:21.916
the actual storylines
of Ant-Man and Ghost.

33:22.333 --> 33:27.964
My only thing that I would do different
is that, it's very hard to find Wasp.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.383
<i>I wish I could see the action more.</i>

33:30.466 --> 33:32.635
It seems a little bit
like an afterthought of,

33:32.719 --> 33:35.930
"Just put her front and center cause we
don't have a lot of time and she's small."

33:36.180 --> 33:40.226
So I wanna ask you, Benny,
about the technical aspects of the build.

33:40.435 --> 33:43.646
BENNY: Technically, I see that you guys
were able to reach the characters.

33:43.896 --> 33:46.315
<i>I mean, holding that position,</i>
<i>it's really hard.</i>

33:46.441 --> 33:51.070
<i>The faces of the characters looks great.</i>
<i>I would have spent a little bit more time,</i>

33:51.279 --> 33:52.822
<i>especially on Ant-Man.</i>

33:53.740 --> 33:58.369
For the slice of cake, I would have use
a cleaning brush. You just press.

33:58.828 --> 34:00.705
Pressing the cleaning brush
into the medium

34:00.788 --> 34:04.625
and it creates those little pockets
that gives a natural look of the cake.

34:04.834 --> 34:09.547
Now, I'm having a little issue with some
of the items in terms of scale.

34:10.048 --> 34:13.760
The characters looks great.
But then, when I put the cupcake

34:13.843 --> 34:16.721
<i>next to the slice of cake,</i>
<i>it's not the right proportion</i>

34:16.804 --> 34:17.889
<i>for the cupcake.</i>

34:18.306 --> 34:20.892
<i>Also the cookie could have been</i>
<i>a little bit bigger, too.</i>

34:21.142 --> 34:23.519
But apart from that,
the overall appearance

34:23.603 --> 34:25.104
of the piece is great.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.733
It's a beautiful, beautiful build,
and I'm very excited

34:28.900 --> 34:31.027
for you guys to have come here
and held it down.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.987
So I'm gonna have
to come check out y'alls bakery

34:33.071 --> 34:35.281
-when I leave this place.
-Thank you, guys.

-What's up, guys?
-What's up?

34:40.244 --> 34:44.207
Before I get into this incredible build,
I want you guys to tell me

this build?

-Oh, definitely working with these guys.
-Yeah. Working together.

34:52.173 --> 34:54.217
-Hundred percent.
-So you guys think you're gonna make it

34:54.300 --> 34:55.802
a kind of a consistent thing?

34:55.885 --> 34:57.095
-Hopefully.
-I think so.

34:57.178 --> 35:00.348
Hopefully, not too often because, girl,
I'm tired, but yes, definitely.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.100
Well, here comes the fun part.

Please walk me through your story
and build.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

35:08.481 --> 35:11.567
TAI: <i>So, this is like</i>
<i>a typical </i>Ant-Man<i> movie scene.</i>

35:11.734 --> 35:14.028
<i>You know, Marvel's really good at kind</i>
<i>of putting Ant-Man</i>

35:14.112 --> 35:17.907
<i>into lots of precarious situations</i>
<i>in really ordinary places.</i>

35:18.366 --> 35:22.537
<i>So, this moment in time is a picnic</i>

<i>kinda coming out</i>

<i>in order to distract him,</i>
<i>because all Yellowjackets love,</i>

35:34.048 --> 35:35.508
<i>you know, like sugary things like that.</i>

35:35.591 --> 35:37.176
You know, so it's kind
of like a diversionary tactic.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.220
-So Ant-Man's really, really smart.

36:10.334 --> 36:12.336
<i>when we go into the greenery,</i>

36:12.753 --> 36:15.339
<i>I actually like</i>
<i>that there's so many different shades.</i>

<i>of "the plot thickens."</i>

36:42.158 --> 36:45.203
Can you walk me through how
you incorporated her into the story?

36:45.328 --> 36:48.080
So, Yellowjacket actually
was fighting Wasp

36:48.164 --> 36:51.167
<i>before Ant-Man showed up.</i>
<i>He actually shot her inside of the cheese.</i>

36:51.250 --> 36:52.793
<i>So that's why she's in there right now.</i>

36:52.877 --> 36:54.629
<i>So, you know, Ant-Man is just trying</i>
<i>to save his boo.</i>

36:54.879 --> 36:57.882
You guys did a really good job
overall with the story.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.218
-Thank you.
-We asked you for a food art piece

37:00.384 --> 37:02.386
and you gave us a lot of food there.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.472
<i>The grass in the back, I mean,</i>

37:04.555 --> 37:06.682
<i>you guys used pastillage,</i>
<i>which is a very delicate</i>

37:06.766 --> 37:08.392
<i>and heavy medium to use.</i>

37:08.476 --> 37:10.895
<i>You guys should be proud</i>
<i>of it because it looks amazing.</i>

37:11.229 --> 37:13.648
<i>The apple, that was the big column</i>

37:13.814 --> 37:15.233
-with the white chocolate?
-Yes.

37:15.316 --> 37:18.653
BENNY: I was worried because I don't know
if it was gonna get dry.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.613
<i>But hey, I love the effect.</i>

37:20.780 --> 37:23.074
-AMIRAH: It looks fabulous.
-The characters, they're really cool,

37:23.491 --> 37:25.117
<i>but there's some issues</i>
<i>with the proportion,</i>

37:25.201 --> 37:27.954
<i>especially in the torso,</i>
<i>I see that it's really long.</i>

37:28.955 --> 37:31.123
<i>To help build the right proportions,</i>

37:31.207 --> 37:33.751
you can create a template
with the actual dimension

37:33.834 --> 37:35.878
that you're gonna use
and always go back and forward

37:36.003 --> 37:37.880
between the template and the piece
when you're working,

37:37.964 --> 37:40.633
so that all the proportions stay correct.

37:41.717 --> 37:45.680
To me, personally, I feel like
the ants are a little bit too big

37:45.763 --> 37:48.933
<i>in proportions to the can.</i>
<i>So I would probably have built</i>

37:49.016 --> 37:50.643
<i>the ants in a smaller scale.</i>

37:51.769 --> 37:53.813
And I'm not a judge,
but the one thing I will say

37:53.938 --> 37:56.649
is that the "Keke" on the can
could have been bigger.

37:56.816 --> 37:57.900
(ALL LAUGH)

37:57.984 --> 38:00.236
From your craftsmanship
to your great attitudes,

38:00.403 --> 38:03.239
<i>it definitely captured</i>
<i>the storytelling of Marvel.</i>

38:03.322 --> 38:05.866
I couldn't be any more proud of you,
and I just met you today.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.036
So, I mean, this is hard for you guys.

38:09.203 --> 38:10.454
-Very hard. (CHUCKLES)
-Yes.

38:10.538 --> 38:11.914
They all did an excellent job.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.167
<i>Baker and the Beasts,</i>
<i>the details are spot on.</i>

38:15.876 --> 38:19.880
AMIRAH: <i>We have Project Alchemy, who...</i>
<i>They are using so many different things.</i>

38:19.964 --> 38:21.340
<i>They have pastillage,</i>
<i>they have white chocolate,</i>

38:21.424 --> 38:22.591
<i>they have ramen.</i>

38:23.342 --> 38:26.762
BENNY: <i>The Crumb Coat team, I mean,</i>
<i>the characters are... I like that.</i>

38:27.346 --> 38:28.347
-You guys know?
-Yeah.

38:28.431 --> 38:29.473
-Good. All right.
-Awesome.

38:29.557 --> 38:30.850
KEKE: Let's go.

38:32.184 --> 38:35.187
-FEMALE VOICE: Oh, wow.
-That is a really cool backdrop.

38:37.398 --> 38:38.524
It looks so magical.

38:39.150 --> 38:43.446
KEKE: As you can all tell, we love, love,
love your creations.

38:43.571 --> 38:46.490
And we think Ant-Man would be honored
to be in any one of them.

38:47.658 --> 38:48.784
But only one can win.

-(EXCLAIMS)

38:57.335 --> 38:58.919
-Disney magic.
-Wow.

38:59.545 --> 39:05.593
The team that created the most foodtastic
Ant-Man action sequence is...

39:07.470 --> 39:09.347
Oh, my God. There's a bubble. (CHUCKLES)

39:23.778 --> 39:25.654

-Party with you. (CHUCKLES)

39:34.580 --> 39:37.875
-Thank you all so very much. Thank you.
-Thank you so much. Thank you.

39:37.958 --> 39:39.585
MATT: <i>I think it's something that,</i>

39:39.794 --> 39:43.297
you know, we'll always have
and it'll be cherished forever.

39:43.464 --> 39:46.384
-Congratulations!
-Amazing!

NARRATOR: <i>And Micro-Girl</i>
<i>still has a lot to show, as well.</i>

39:53.641 --> 39:57.937
Let it be known across all realms,
normal or particle size,

39:58.062 --> 40:02.024
that wherever trouble calls,
Micro-Girl will answer that call.

40:02.441 --> 40:06.237

NARRATOR: <i>You realize it was just</i>
<i>a dream, right?</i>

40:25.881 --> 40:29.009
Oh, hey, you call it a dream,
but I call it an aspiration.
