00:00.671 --> 00:02.203
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.203 --> 00:06.207
BREE'S NEW ROMANCE GOT OFF
TO A LIVELY START...

00:06.207 --> 00:10.211
SO YOU'RE COURTING ME.
 I'M TRYING TO. WHEN WILL YOU
STOP PLAYING HARD TO GET?

00:10.211 --> 00:12.613
MAYBE WHEN YOU STOP PLAYING
HARD TO WANT.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.746
WHILE LYNETTE'S MARRIAGE
HIT THE ROCKS.

00:15.746 --> 00:18.249
I THINK WE'RE THE ONES
WHO NEED A VACATION--

00:18.249 --> 00:22.022
JUST A WEEKEND, GET A CHANCE
TO WORK THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.294
SUSAN'S WARNING...

00:23.294 --> 00:25.796
(amplified voice)
ABOUT THOSE COOKIES I MADE--

00:25.796 --> 00:28.329
DON'T EAT THEM.
THEY'RE POISONED.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.161
THAT'S HER, OFFICERS.

00:30.161 --> 00:32.762
BECAME AN ADMISSION OF GUILT.

00:32.762 --> 00:36.807
AND GABY WAS UNAWARE...

00:36.807 --> 00:39.110
THAT A DARK PRESENCE

00:39.110 --> 00:42.643
HAD ARRIVED ON THE LANE.

00:48.048 --> 00:52.183
(Mary Alice) SUSAN DELFINO
HAD ALWAYS PLAYED BY THE RULES.

00:52.183 --> 00:57.228
SHE OBEYED EVERY LABEL...

00:57.228 --> 01:00.761
SHE PERFORMED HER CIVIC DUTY...

01:01.832 --> 01:07.598
SHE RESPECTED
ALL LEGAL BOUNDARIES...

01:07.598 --> 01:10.141
SO WHEN SHE WAS QUESTIONED

01:10.141 --> 01:12.543
ABOUT THE POISONING
OF PAUL YOUNG...

01:12.543 --> 01:14.805
PLEASE STATE
YOUR NAME AND AGE.

01:14.805 --> 01:17.608
SUSAN WAS MORE
THAN A LITTLE UPSET.

01:17.608 --> 01:20.851
MY AGE? WHAT DOES MY AGE
HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

01:20.851 --> 01:23.083
MRS. DELFINO... (sighs)

01:23.083 --> 01:25.486
I'M 38.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.558
AM I UNDER OATH?

01:27.558 --> 01:30.761
NO.
 38.

01:30.761 --> 01:32.763
I DON'T THINK YOU APPRECIATE

01:32.763 --> 01:34.765
THE SERIOUSNESS
OF THE POSITION YOU'RE IN.

01:34.765 --> 01:37.868
YOU COULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE
AT THAT SCHOOL.

01:37.868 --> 01:39.770
BUT I DIDN'T
POISON THE COOKIES.

01:39.770 --> 01:42.233
YET YOU KNEW
THEY WERE POISONED.

01:42.233 --> 01:45.176
YES, BY FELICIA TILLMAN.
I MEAN... (sighs)

01:45.176 --> 01:49.109
OKAY, I BAKED THEM,
BUT SHE ADDED THE POISON.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.281
THAT WAS YOUR ARRANGEMENT?

01:50.281 --> 01:52.783
NO! NO, WE DIDN'T
HAVE AN ARRANGEMENT.

01:52.783 --> 01:56.317
SHE WAS TRYING
TO MURDER PAUL YOUNG.

01:56.317 --> 01:59.119
SO ALL YOU DID WAS DELIVER
THE POISONED FOOD?

01:59.119 --> 02:02.223
EXACTLY.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.524
NO, WAIT, UH...

02:03.524 --> 02:07.198
NO, I HAD NO IDEA THAT
ANYTHING WAS POISONED, EVER.

02:07.198 --> 02:09.330
EXCEPT THE COOKIES.

02:11.402 --> 02:13.234
EXCEPT THE COOKIES.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.836
(sighs)

02:15.836 --> 02:19.210
LOOK, TALK TO FELICIA.
SHE HATED PAUL.

02:19.210 --> 02:22.273
YES, BUT YOU HAD YOUR REASONS
FOR HATING MR. YOUNG, TOO.

02:22.273 --> 02:25.846
NO, I LIKE PAUL.
HIS WIFE GAVE ME HER KIDNEY.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.878
AFTER YOU LOST YOUR KIDNEY

02:27.878 --> 02:30.381
IN A RIOT WHICH MR. YOUNG
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR.

02:30.381 --> 02:32.683
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

02:32.683 --> 02:34.185
MR. YOUNG.

02:34.185 --> 02:37.728
HE ALSO SAID HE BLEW THE WHISTLE
ON YOUR INTERNET PORN CAREER,

02:37.728 --> 02:40.631
CAUSING YOU TO LOSE YOUR JOB
AT THE OAKRIDGE SCHOOL,

02:40.631 --> 02:44.795
THE SAME SCHOOL YOU BROUGHT
THOSE POISONED COOKIES TO.

02:47.238 --> 02:49.740
NOW HOW ABOUT YOU START
TELLING ME THE TRUTH?

02:53.344 --> 02:55.175
I'M NOT 38.

02:57.248 --> 03:00.551
(cell phone rings)

03:00.551 --> 03:02.253
(beep)

03:02.253 --> 03:03.484
FIND ANYTHING?

03:05.556 --> 03:06.657
UH-HUH.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.860
OKAY, THANKS.

03:09.860 --> 03:11.191
(cell phone shuts, thud)

03:11.191 --> 03:13.694
WE FOUND A GLASS VIAL
AND SOME SYRINGES

03:13.694 --> 03:15.696
IN THE DUMPSTER
BEHIND YOUR APARTMENT.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.229
THEY ALL HAD TRACES
OF ANTIFREEZE.

03:18.229 --> 03:19.900
OH, GOD.

03:19.900 --> 03:25.776
YES, SUSAN DELFINO HAD ALWAYS
PLAYED BY THE RULES...

03:25.776 --> 03:28.909
BUT SHE WAS ABOUT
TO FIND OUT...

03:28.909 --> 03:30.811
(clank)

03:30.811 --> 03:34.245
THIS WASN'T A GAME.

03:34.245 --> 03:45.926
♪♪♪

03:45.926 --> 03:47.428
SOMETIMES

03:47.428 --> 03:50.931
IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS
THAT MAKE US FEEL SECURE,

03:50.931 --> 03:55.266
LIKE AN OLD FRIEND
AT BEDTIME...

03:55.266 --> 03:59.970
MONEY SAVED FOR A RAINY DAY...

03:59.970 --> 04:04.475
OR MATCHING COFFEE MUGS.

04:04.475 --> 04:07.378
BUT THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN THESE SMALL COMFORTS

04:07.378 --> 04:09.380
ARE UP AGAINST BIG CHALLENGES.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.382
I'M GLAD WE'RE DOING THIS.

04:11.382 --> 04:13.384
ME, TOO.

04:13.384 --> 04:15.886
SHOULD HAVE DONE IT
A LONG TIME AGO.

04:15.886 --> 04:17.387
HA. COMPLETELY AGREE.

04:17.387 --> 04:21.031
WE JUST NEEDED TO GET AWAY FROM
EVERYTHING, JUST THE TWO OF US--

04:21.031 --> 04:23.994
NO KIDS, NO WORK, NO TV...

04:23.994 --> 04:27.037
WHAT? NO TV?

04:27.037 --> 04:30.671
AW, COME ON. IT'S A B&B--
BED-AND-BASEBALL.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.674
(sighs) YOU GONNA
TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY?

04:33.674 --> 04:35.676
YES.

04:37.678 --> 04:41.412
I'M TAKING THIS
VERY SERIOUSLY.

04:41.412 --> 04:44.515
OKAY.

04:47.918 --> 04:51.562
SO WHAT DO YOU FEEL LIKE DOING?
YOU WANT TO GO TO BED, OR...

04:51.562 --> 04:54.995
BED SOUNDS GOOD.
I'M EXHAUSTED. OOH...

04:54.995 --> 04:56.497
U-U-UNLESS YOU WANT TO--

04:56.497 --> 04:57.998
NO. NO.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.300
I'M TIRED, TOO.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.302
LET'S GET
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.905
WE HAVE THE WHOLE WEEKEND
AHEAD OF US.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.044
HEY.

05:14.044 --> 05:15.746
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

05:15.746 --> 05:18.318
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.850
(both chuckle)

05:24.024 --> 05:26.857
THANKS FOR DINNER.
THAT WAS AMAZING.

05:26.857 --> 05:28.859
I'M GLAD YOU ENJOYED IT.

05:28.859 --> 05:30.861
YOU KIDDING? I GOT TO CHASE

05:30.861 --> 05:33.864
TWICE AS MANY BAD GUYS
TOMORROW TO BURN IT OFF.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.438

OH, UM... (chuckles)

05:44.645 --> 05:45.746
(chuckles)

05:46.947 --> 05:49.920
WOW. THAT IS THE ONE PART OF
DATING THAT I HAVEN'T MISSED.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.952
I KNOW, THE WHOLE
QUESTION OF INTIMACY.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.385
WILL HE KISS ME?
WILL HE NOT?

05:54.385 --> 05:57.388
WILL SHE BE MAD IF I TRY?
WILL SHE BE MAD IF I DON'T?

05:57.388 --> 06:01.091
THEN WHY DON'T WE SKIP ALL THAT
AND LAY OUR CARDS ON THE TABLE?

06:01.091 --> 06:04.134
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT
TWO REASONABLE ADULTS MIGHT DO.

06:04.134 --> 06:09.840
I FIND YOU
VERY... ATTRACTIVE.

06:09.840 --> 06:12.703
AND I THINK
YOU'RE A KNOCKOUT.

06:12.703 --> 06:14.004
HMM. REALLY?

06:14.004 --> 06:17.047
YEAH, THAT'S WHY...

06:17.047 --> 06:19.550
IT'S SO HARD...

06:19.550 --> 06:22.012
WOW, WE REALLY ARE PUTTING
OUR CARDS ON THE TABLE.

06:22.012 --> 06:24.014
TO WAIT.

06:24.014 --> 06:25.716
WAIT?

06:25.716 --> 06:30.621
UM, JUST TILL MY DIVORCE
GOES THROUGH, 'CAUSE TILL THEN,

06:30.621 --> 06:36.026
I'M TECHNICALLY MARRIED,
SO ANYTHING WE DO IS ADULTERY.

06:36.026 --> 06:39.770
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK THAT'S VERY ADMIRABLE.

06:39.770 --> 06:41.131
YEAH?

06:41.131 --> 06:43.003
DEFINITELY.
IT'S REFRESHING TO FIND

06:43.003 --> 06:45.706
A MAN WHOSE MORALITY ISN'T
COMPROMISED BY HIS LIBIDO.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.979
BESIDES, SOMETIMES WAITING
CAN BE HALF THE FUN.

06:48.979 --> 06:51.942
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS
YOU'RE WAITING FOR...

07:01.021 --> 07:04.955
NOW THAT'S THE PART
OF DATING I HAVE MISSED.

07:04.955 --> 07:06.497
(chuckles)

07:13.103 --> 07:14.535

07:28.679 --> 07:31.752
(car door closes, engine starts)

07:31.752 --> 07:34.454
HOW CAN THEY ARREST ME?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.927
THEY FOUND SYRINGES
AND ANTIFREEZE AT YOUR HOUSE.

07:36.927 --> 07:38.929
UNLESS YOU'RE
A SUICIDAL DIABETIC,

07:38.929 --> 07:40.561
THAT'S PRETTY SUSPICIOUS.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.564
BUT FELICIA WAS AT MY HOUSE
WHEN I WAS MAKING PAUL'S FOOD.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.567
CLEARLY,
SHE'S TRYING TO FRAME ME.
 ANY WAY TO PROVE IT?

07:46.567 --> 07:49.970
THE WOMAN HACKED OFF TWO OF HER
FINGERS TO FRAME SOMEONE ELSE.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.802
SHE'S A FRAMER.

07:51.802 --> 07:53.974
TO IMPLICATE FELICIA,
WE'D NEED SOME EVIDENCE

07:53.974 --> 07:56.476
THAT SHE WAS ACTIVELY
TRYING TO KILL PAUL.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.478
(sighs)

07:58.478 --> 08:02.152
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP YOU WITH THAT.

08:04.114 --> 08:06.857
A FEW MONTHS AGO,
FELICIA CALLED ME FROM PRISON,

08:06.857 --> 08:09.159
SAID SHE NEEDED TO SEE ME.

08:09.159 --> 08:11.522
YOU NEVER TOLD ME THIS.

08:11.522 --> 08:13.994
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT
WAS ABOUT, SO I WENT.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.597
SHE OFFERED ME $10,000
TO KILL PAUL.

08:16.597 --> 08:17.868
WHAT?

08:17.868 --> 08:21.932
THIS WAS IN THE VISITOR'S ROOM?
ON THE PHONE?

08:21.932 --> 08:23.934
I'LL SEE IF THEY HAVE
ANY RECORDINGS.

08:23.934 --> 08:27.137
MIGHT TAKE A DAY OR TWO.
THIS IS GOOD.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.043
(door closes)
 HOW COULD YOU
KEEP THAT FROM ME?

08:33.043 --> 08:36.817
I DON'T KNOW.
I... GUESS I WAS ASHAMED.

08:36.817 --> 08:39.149
WHY? Y-YOU SAID NO.

08:39.149 --> 08:41.722
YEAH, AFTER I THOUGHT
ABOUT IT FOR A WEEK.

SO THERE'S A PLACE IN TOWN WHERE
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN CANDLES.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.113
CANDLE MAKING?

11:53.113 --> 11:54.114
MM.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.415
(chuckles) HOPEFULLY,

11:55.415 --> 11:58.718
IT'S NEXT TO A PLACE WHERE
WE CAN MAKE OUR OWN BULLETS.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.791
(chuckles)
 YEAH.
DOES SOUND PRETTY LAME.

12:00.791 --> 12:03.794
BESIDES, WE DIDN'T COME HERE
TO DO ARTS AND CRAFTS.

12:03.794 --> 12:07.798
RIGHT. WE CAME HERE
TO WORK ON STUFF...

12:07.798 --> 12:09.099
TALK.

12:09.099 --> 12:10.400
HMM.

12:10.400 --> 12:14.404
SO... MAYBE WE SHOULD
GO BACK TO OUR ROOM AND...

12:14.404 --> 12:16.266
TALK.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.210
(man) HEY THERE. GOOD MORNING.

12:20.210 --> 12:21.071
MORNING.

12:21.071 --> 12:23.113
GOOD MORNING.
 HEY.

12:23.113 --> 12:24.414
HI. I'M LISA.
 OH...

12:24.414 --> 12:26.216
THIS IS MY HUSBAND ANDY.

12:26.216 --> 12:28.879
OH, HI. I'M LYNETTE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
 YOU, TOO.

12:28.879 --> 12:30.881
TOM.
 NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:30.881 --> 12:34.084
SO IS THIS
YOUR FIRST TIME HERE?
 OH. THANK YOU, SWEETIE.

12:34.084 --> 12:36.226
YEP, FIRST TIME.

12:36.226 --> 12:38.228
OHH. IT'S OUR THIRD TIME.
WE LOVE IT HERE.

12:38.228 --> 12:41.161
AND IT'S SO QUIET AND INTIMATE.
WHAT COULD BE BETTER, RIGHT?

12:41.161 --> 12:42.863
RIGHT.
 YOU SAID IT.

12:42.863 --> 12:46.436
SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
UP TO TODAY?
 I DON'T KNOW.

12:46.436 --> 12:49.499
WE'LL PROBABLY JUST HANG OUT.
WHAT ABOUT YOU GUYS?

12:49.499 --> 12:51.441
WE ARE GOING
CANDLE DIPPING.

12:51.441 --> 12:53.143
(all laugh)

12:53.143 --> 12:55.175
ANY CHANCE YOU WANT
TO COME WITH?

12:55.175 --> 12:58.849
OH, ANDY, I'M SURE THEY
CAME UP HERE TO BE ALONE.

12:58.849 --> 13:00.851
I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW...

13:00.851 --> 13:03.213
SOUNDS LIKE
IT... COULD BE FUN.

13:03.213 --> 13:05.315
(chuckles)
 YEAH. WE CAN BE ALONE LATER.

13:05.315 --> 13:08.318
LET'S GO
DIP SOME CANDLES.

13:14.124 --> 13:16.426
YOU KNOW
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU.

13:16.426 --> 13:18.428
THINK ABOUT IT.
OF ALL THE PEOPLE

13:18.428 --> 13:21.371
THAT WANT YOU DEAD, YOU THINK
SUSAN'S THE ONE TO DO IT?

13:21.371 --> 13:24.374
SHE'S THE ONLY PERSON IN THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD WHO'S STUCK BY YOU.

13:24.374 --> 13:26.076
YOU HEARD THE EVIDENCE.

13:26.076 --> 13:28.108
ALL THE FOOD
CAME FROM YOUR KITCHEN.

13:28.108 --> 13:31.181
AND YOU KNOW WHO WAS HELPING
SUSAN COOK IT? FELICIA TILLMAN.

13:31.181 --> 13:32.542
WHAT?

13:32.542 --> 13:36.947
THE SAME WOMAN WHO OFFERED ME
$10,000 TO KILL YOU.

13:36.947 --> 13:40.250
SHE OFFERED YOU
$10,000 TO KILL ME?

13:40.250 --> 13:42.192
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

13:42.192 --> 13:44.094
YOU'RE STILL STANDING HERE.

13:54.204 --> 13:57.207
(door creaking)

14:02.012 --> 14:03.313
(sighs)

14:03.313 --> 14:06.146
BELIEVE ME NOW?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.350
SO TELL ME,

14:10.350 --> 14:13.353
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT GUY
I SAW LEAVING HERE LAST NIGHT?

14:13.353 --> 14:15.355
HIS NAME IS CHUCK,
HE'S A DETECTIVE,

14:15.355 --> 14:18.328
AND HE AND I HAVE BEEN
SEEING EACH OTHER.

14:18.328 --> 14:22.132
SEEING? AS IN DATING?

14:22.132 --> 14:23.863
YOU SOUND SURPRISED.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.865
WELL, I DON'T LIKE
SPREADING VICIOUS GOSSIP...

14:25.865 --> 14:30.300
OH, WHO AM I KIDDING? I LOVE IT.
BREE, THAT GUY IS GAY.

14:30.300 --> 14:33.373
YOU SAY THAT ABOUT EVERYONE.
YOU SAID THAT ABOUT TOM SCAVO.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.376
I DIDN'T SAY HE WAS GAY.
I SAID IF I HAD MAGIC POWERS,

14:36.376 --> 14:39.379
I WOULD MAKE HIM GAY. BUT AS FAR
AS DETECTIVE HOTTIE GOES,

14:39.379 --> 14:42.112
I'VE SEEN HIM
AT MY FAVORITE GAY BAR.

14:42.112 --> 14:44.054
NO. I AM SURE IT WASN'T HIM.

14:44.054 --> 14:46.356
I'M SURE IT WAS.
I NEVER FORGET A GAY FACE.

14:46.356 --> 14:49.459
I HAVE WHAT SCIENTISTS CALL
A HOMO-GRAPHIC MEMORY.

14:49.459 --> 14:52.462
CHUCK WAS MARRIED
FOR 18 YEARS.

14:52.462 --> 14:53.994
"WAS"? INTERESTING.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.996
FAILED MARRIAGE.
LET'S CONNECT THOSE DOTS.

14:55.996 --> 14:59.129
OKAY, THEN EXPLAIN
WHY HE'S THE ONE CHASING ME.

14:59.129 --> 15:01.501
HE'S A COP.
IT'S A VERY MASCULINE CULTURE,

15:01.501 --> 15:04.204
AND NOW THAT HE CAN'T HIDE
BEHIND HIS WIFE ANYMORE,

15:04.204 --> 15:07.107
HE NEEDS A GIRLFRIEND
SO HE'S STILL "ONE OF THE GUYS."

15:07.107 --> 15:09.209
LET'S DROP IT.
 OKAY, TELL ME I'M WRONG.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.442
TELL ME YOU'VE HAD
THE BEST SEX YOU'VE EVER HAD.

15:15.145 --> 15:17.417
YOU HAVE HAD SEX?

15:17.417 --> 15:20.120
HE SAID HE WANTED TO WAIT.

15:20.120 --> 15:24.294
OKAY, I'M CALLING IT.
TIME OF GAY--11:21.

15:24.294 --> 15:25.595
(dish clatters)

15:25.595 --> 15:27.297
(sighs)

15:27.297 --> 15:29.299
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT ITALIAN FOOD...

15:29.299 --> 15:30.630
(Lisa) YEAH.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.633
BUT I CANNOT BELIEVE
HOW MUCH I ATE. IT WAS SO GOOD.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.066
IT WAS AWESOME,
AND THANK YOU BOTH.

15:36.066 --> 15:39.269
YEAH, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
PAY FOR DINNER...
 OR LUNCH...

15:39.269 --> 15:42.612
OR OUR CANDLE MAKING LESSONS.
 IT WAS MY PLEASURE.
WHAT'S THE POINT

15:42.612 --> 15:45.675
OF MAKING THE BIG BUCKS
IF YOU CAN'T SPREAD IT AROUND?

15:45.675 --> 15:48.348
PLEASE,
STOP SAYING "BIG BUCKS."

15:48.348 --> 15:51.151
I HAVEN'T SAID IT THAT MUCH.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.254
IF I HAD A NICKEL FOR EVERY TIME
YOU'VE SAID "BIG BUCKS,"

15:54.254 --> 15:56.286
I'D HAVE BIG BUCKS. (chuckles)
 (clink)

15:58.288 --> 16:01.261
IT'S GETTING LATE.
 YEAH, WE SHOULD REALLY
LET YOU GUYS GO.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.633
LATE? IT'S ONLY 10:00.

16:03.633 --> 16:06.666
HEY, WHO'S UP
FOR A GAME OF SPADES?

16:06.666 --> 16:08.668
COME ON, LISA.
BOYS AGAINST GIRLS.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.700
LET'S KICK SOME BUTT.

16:14.144 --> 16:15.145
OKAY.

16:15.145 --> 16:16.606
GREAT. OKAY. YEAH.

16:16.606 --> 16:19.609
SO IT IS 3:00 A.M.
I AM CREEPING DOWN THE STAIRS

16:19.609 --> 16:23.513
IN MY UNDERWEAR, HOLDING
THE GOLF CLUB LIKE A MACHETE.

16:23.513 --> 16:26.656
I HEAR THE NOISE AGAIN,
COMING FROM THE KITCHEN--

16:26.656 --> 16:28.588
TURNS OUT,
IT'S OUR DAUGHTER PENNY,

16:28.588 --> 16:31.221
WHO'S WAITING TO GET
THE EASTER BUNNY'S AUTOGRAPH.

16:31.221 --> 16:32.292
(chuckles)
 THAT'S CUTE.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.523
WHAT?

16:33.523 --> 16:37.197
YOU ALWAYS DO THAT.
I'M--I'M--I'M TELLING A STORY,

16:37.197 --> 16:40.200
AND YOU JUMP IN
AND STEAL THE PUNCH LINE.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.502
'CAUSE YOU GO ON FOREVER.
YOU HEARD A NOISE,

16:42.502 --> 16:45.505
YOU CHECKED IT OUT, TURNS OUT
IT'S PENNY. LAUGH, LAUGH, LAUGH.

16:45.505 --> 16:49.639
EVERYBODY'S THE SAME AGE AS WHEN
THE STORY STARTED. (laughs)
 WELL, MY APOLOGIES, EVERYBODY.

16:49.639 --> 16:53.713
I AM SORRY I AM NOT
A GIFTED RACONTEUR LIKE MY WIFE.

16:53.713 --> 16:57.087
WHAT CAN I SAY, TOM? I ACTUALLY
DO KNOW HOW TO TELL A STORY.

16:57.087 --> 17:00.090
YEAH, LIKE THAT SPELLBINDER YOU
TOLD THE GUY AT THE CANDLE SHOP

17:00.090 --> 17:02.452
TODAY ABOUT GROWING
WINTER SQUASH? ONE MORE SECOND,

17:02.452 --> 17:05.454
HE WAS READY TO POUR MOLTEN WAX
DIRECTLY INTO HIS EARS.

17:05.454 --> 17:07.457
OH, YOU HEARD THAT STORY?

17:07.457 --> 17:11.361
I FIGURED YOU WERE BUSY
COUNTING YOUR BIG BUCKS.

17:11.361 --> 17:13.803
(inhales sharply)
SHEESH, IT'S MIDNIGHT ALREADY.

17:13.803 --> 17:16.806
YEAH, WE BETTER GET SOME SLEEP.
WE GOT A BIG DAY TOMORROW.

17:16.806 --> 17:19.439
OH, YEAH?
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

17:19.439 --> 17:20.440
(exhales deeply)

17:20.440 --> 17:22.571
NOTHING.

17:22.571 --> 17:24.574
GOOD NIGHT, YOU GUYS.
 GOOD NIGHT.

17:24.574 --> 17:26.276
GOOD NIGHT.
 GOOD NIGHT.

17:26.276 --> 17:27.577
(footsteps recede)

17:29.749 --> 17:32.782
WELL, I THINK
I'M GONNA TURN IN, TOO.

17:32.782 --> 17:35.785
(sets down cards)

17:35.785 --> 17:38.428
YOU COMING?

17:38.428 --> 17:43.333
(TV turns on)
 NAH, I'M GONNA CHECK OUT
SOME SCORES ON THE TV.

17:46.196 --> 17:48.638
OKAY.

18:03.283 --> 18:06.286
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing)
 THANK YOU.

18:06.286 --> 18:10.390
HELLO. ARE YOU READY
FOR OUR LUNCH DATE?

18:10.390 --> 18:14.324
I TRIED TO CALL YOU. I GOT TO
INTERVIEW A ROBBERY WITNESS.

18:14.324 --> 18:16.596
I'M REALLY SORRY.
 IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,

18:16.596 --> 18:19.799
AND AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,
I'M FREE FOR DINNER, TOO.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.332
GREAT. HEY.
HEY, GUYS, SAY HI TO BREE.

18:22.332 --> 18:24.174
(man) HI.
 (man) HEY, BREE.

18:24.174 --> 18:27.477
SEE? I WASN'T MAKING HER UP.
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

18:27.477 --> 18:29.479
(kisses)

18:29.479 --> 18:32.582
(telephone ringing)
 (man) HE'S PROCESSING NOW.

18:32.582 --> 18:36.646
HE'S IN THE HOLDING CELL.
BE UP IN ABOUT 40, 45 MINUTES.

18:36.646 --> 18:40.390
GREAT PICTURE OF CHUCK, HUH?
 YEAH. YEAH.
WHO'S, UH, THAT WITH HIM?

18:40.390 --> 18:42.452
WELL, THAT WAS HIS PARTNER,
PETE CROWLEY.
 (pen clicks)

18:42.452 --> 18:45.195
OH. ARE CHUCK AND PETE
STILL PARTNERS?

18:45.195 --> 18:49.329
NO. PETE'S NOT HERE ANYMORE.

18:49.329 --> 18:52.462
I HOPE IT WASN'T,
UH, SOMETHING TRAGIC.

18:52.462 --> 18:55.465
NO, NOT TRAGIC. JUST...

18:55.465 --> 18:58.468
WEIRD.

18:58.468 --> 19:00.410
EXCUSE ME.

19:04.774 --> 19:08.378
THEY WERE BEST FRIENDS
AND PARTNERS FOR NINE YEARS,

19:08.378 --> 19:11.381
AND THEN LAST YEAR THEY WENT
ON A CAMPING TRIP TOGETHER.

19:11.381 --> 19:13.753
WHEN THEY GOT BACK,
THEY WEREN'T SPEAKING,

19:13.753 --> 19:15.755
PETE PUT IN FOR A TRANSFER,

19:15.755 --> 19:18.758
AND NO ONE ON THE FORCE
KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED.
 IT'S BEYOND OBVIOUS.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.531
CHUCK MUST HAVE HAD
A HUGE CRUSH ON THIS GUY.

19:21.531 --> 19:23.793
YOU THINK HE WAS IN LOVE
WITH HIS PARTNER?

19:23.793 --> 19:27.367
PLEASE. I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM,
AND I'VE ONLY SEEN HIS PICTURE.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.869
HE PICKS A TOTAL HOTTIE
FOR A PARTNER,

19:29.869 --> 19:33.273
THEN SITS ON HIS FEELINGS
FOR NINE YEARS, UNTIL...

19:33.273 --> 19:36.476
THE CAMPING TRIP.

19:36.476 --> 19:40.810
THEY'RE IN THE WOODS,
IN A TENT, ALONE.

19:40.810 --> 19:43.253
COUPLE OF BEERS,
THEN BAM, CHUCK POUNCES,

19:43.253 --> 19:45.585
AND HIS PARTNER'S ALL LIKE,
"STOP.

19:45.585 --> 19:50.320
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GET OFF ME."

19:50.320 --> 19:51.621
OH, GOD.

19:51.621 --> 19:54.564
IT'S ME AND TODD MANKIEWICZ
ALL OVER AGAIN.

19:54.564 --> 19:57.427
THIS IS RIDICULOUS. CHUCK IS NOT
GAY, AND I AM GONNA PROVE IT.

19:57.427 --> 19:59.929
HOW?
 HE'S TAKING ME
TO DINNER TONIGHT,

19:59.929 --> 20:03.403
AND I MAY JUST HAVE TO
OFFER MYSELF UP AS DESSERT.

20:03.403 --> 20:06.536
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
JUST FORWARD ME THIS PICTURE.

20:06.536 --> 20:10.340
I'VE GOT SOME PHOTOSHOPPING
TO DO. (inhales and exhales)

20:10.340 --> 20:14.414
OUR POLICY HERE
IS ASK QUESTIONS FIRST,

20:14.414 --> 20:15.915
SHOOT LATER.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.788
YOU WILL KNOW EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT A FIREARM

20:18.788 --> 20:20.420
BEFORE EVER ACTUALLY
HOLDING ONE.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.422
WHAT'S THERE TO KNOW?
YOU POINT, YOU SHOOT,

20:22.422 --> 20:24.924
SOMEBODY BAD FALLS DOWN.
(giggles)

20:24.924 --> 20:29.259
MS. SOLIS, MIND IF I ASK WHY
IT IS YOU'RE TAKING THIS CLASS?

20:29.259 --> 20:31.261
TO PROTECT MYSELF.

20:31.261 --> 20:34.504
PROTECTION. WHY A GUN?
WHY NOT JUST GET A DOG?

20:34.504 --> 20:37.337
WELL, FOR ONE, IF YOU
LEAVE A GUN IN THE HOUSE,

20:37.337 --> 20:39.339
IT DOESN'T RIP APART
YOUR THROW PILLOWS

20:39.339 --> 20:41.741
THEN LEAVE A GIFT
ON YOUR HALL CARPET. (chuckles)

20:41.741 --> 20:43.743
AHEM.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.275
COULD YOU SHOOT ME?

20:45.275 --> 20:46.976
WHAT?

20:46.976 --> 20:50.350
I'M AN INTRUDER
THAT JUST BROKE INTO YOUR HOME.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.582
COULD YOU SHOOT ME?

20:52.582 --> 20:55.355
UH, SURE. WHY NOT?

20:55.355 --> 20:57.827
REALLY? WHERE?
THE HEAD? CHEST?

20:57.827 --> 21:00.630
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY ARE YOU GETTING SO CLOSE?
 I'M AN INTRUDER.
I'M HERE TO HURT YOU.

21:00.630 --> 21:03.333
COULD YOU POINT THE GUN,
FIRE IT, AND KILL ME--

21:03.333 --> 21:06.996
AND THEN LIVE WITH THAT
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

21:10.340 --> 21:11.871
NO.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.644
IF ANY OF YOU FEEL
THE SAME WAY, LEAVE NOW.

21:14.644 --> 21:17.447
A GUN IN THE HANDS OF SOMEONE
WHO IS AFRAID TO USE IT

21:17.447 --> 21:20.380
IS THE MOST DANGEROUS WEAPON
IN THE WORLD--

21:20.380 --> 21:23.413
NOT FOR YOUR INTENDED VICTIM...

21:23.413 --> 21:25.455
FOR YOU.

21:31.421 --> 21:33.423
(doorbell rings)

21:35.895 --> 21:37.897
SUSAN.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.899
I WANTED TO THANK YOU.

21:39.899 --> 21:43.002
I HEARD THAT YOU SPOKE TO
THE POLICE AND HELPED CLEAR ME.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.004
I'M SORRY I DOUBTED YOU.

21:45.004 --> 21:49.308
I GUESS I'M NOT USED TO PEOPLE
BEING KIND TO ME.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.810
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

21:50.810 --> 21:53.643
I CAN'T STAY HERE.

21:53.643 --> 21:55.945
BUT FELICIA'S GONE.
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

21:55.945 --> 21:58.317
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH FELICIA.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.390
IT'S JUST TIME
FOR ME TO GO.

22:00.390 --> 22:03.553
PAUL, Y-YOU CAN'T LEAVE
THE LANE.

22:03.553 --> 22:05.054
YOU BELONG HERE.

22:05.054 --> 22:08.498
NO, I DON'T.
I NEVER HAVE.

22:08.498 --> 22:11.501
WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WHEN I FIRST MOVED HERE,

22:11.501 --> 22:13.963
YOU AND MARY ALICE
WERE SO NICE TO ME.

22:13.963 --> 22:16.335
YOU WERE THE REASON
I WANTED TO LIVE HERE.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.638
WE HAD TO BE NICE.
WE CAME HERE RUNNING AWAY

22:18.638 --> 22:20.640
FROM SOMETHING TERRIBLE
WE'D DONE.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.111
WE SPENT EVERY DAY WAITING

22:22.111 --> 22:24.113
FOR THE PAST
TO CATCH UP WITH US.

22:24.113 --> 22:26.476
AND IT DID.

22:26.476 --> 22:29.679
SOONER OR LATER,
THE PAST ALWAYS CATCHES UP.

22:29.679 --> 22:31.681
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

22:31.681 --> 22:34.484
YOU HAVE A CHANCE
TO START OVER NOW.

22:34.484 --> 22:37.527
AND YOU... WERE THE ONLY ONE
AROUND HERE

22:37.527 --> 22:40.029
WHO EVER THOUGHT
I COULD START OVER.

22:40.029 --> 22:41.591
I STILL DO.

22:41.591 --> 22:44.964
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON, PAUL.
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.466
I KNOW...

22:46.466 --> 22:49.669
AND I'D JUST AS SOON LEAVE
WHILE YOU STILL DO.

22:49.669 --> 22:53.102
(jangles)
 HERE, TAKE THESE.

22:54.103 --> 22:56.506
MOVE BACK IN
WITH YOUR FAMILY.

22:56.506 --> 22:58.848
AS FAR AS THE REST
OF THE RENT...

22:58.848 --> 23:00.850
IT'S MY GIFT TO YOU.

23:00.850 --> 23:03.453
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU.

23:03.453 --> 23:04.884
JUST BE HAPPY HERE.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.417
(sighs deeply)

23:07.417 --> 23:08.558
WE WILL.

23:08.558 --> 23:09.789
(laughs)

23:20.169 --> 23:23.473
(horn honks,
siren wailing in distance)

23:23.473 --> 23:26.135
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT EVEN 10:00 YET.

23:26.135 --> 23:28.137
ARE YOU UP
FOR A NIGHTCAP?

23:28.137 --> 23:31.541
SURE. I KNOW
THIS FABULOUS LITTLE SPOT.

23:31.541 --> 23:35.485
(whispers) FABULOUS.

23:35.485 --> 23:37.487
(normal voice)
ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING

23:37.487 --> 23:40.019
WE COULD GO BACK
TO YOUR PLACE.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.151
UM... (chuckles)
 (giggles)

23:42.151 --> 23:45.194
UM, I DON'T--I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

23:45.194 --> 23:46.956
REALLY?

23:46.956 --> 23:49.158
(whispers)
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

23:49.158 --> 23:51.701
I'M NOT SURE
I COULD TRUST MYSELF.

23:51.701 --> 23:53.202
REMEMBER OUR AGREEMENT?

23:53.202 --> 23:55.535
OH, ARE WE REALLY
STICKING TO THAT?

23:55.535 --> 23:57.166
UM...

23:57.166 --> 23:58.808
LOOK, I...

23:58.808 --> 24:01.140
I-I HAVE TO.

24:03.112 --> 24:05.044
OKAY.

24:05.044 --> 24:07.446
BUT I STILL
WANT THAT NIGHTCAP.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.649
WHERE TO?

24:09.649 --> 24:12.582
I KNOW JUST THE PLACE.

24:12.582 --> 24:14.584
(dance music playing)

24:14.584 --> 24:17.587
BREE, ARE YOU--ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO COME IN HERE?

24:17.587 --> 24:20.089
'CAUSE I THINK
THIS IS A GAY BAR.
 REALLY? AND HOW
WOULD YOU KNOW THAT?

24:20.089 --> 24:21.891
OKAY, UM...

24:21.891 --> 24:23.493
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

24:23.493 --> 24:26.496
HEY, GIRLFRIEND!
WHERE YOU BEEN HIDING YOURSELF?

24:26.496 --> 24:27.597
HEY, TERRENCE.

24:27.597 --> 24:28.968
WAIT UNTIL
YOU HEAR THE DISH...

24:28.968 --> 24:31.641
STEVE AND FAT STEVE
BROKE UP.

24:31.641 --> 24:33.573
AND FAT STEVE
IS NOW PISSED STEVE.

24:33.573 --> 24:36.676
I'M--I'M--I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.
 MM-HMM.

24:36.676 --> 24:40.179
OKAY, SO THIS IS WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.981
CHUCK...

24:41.981 --> 24:44.253
I ALREADY KNOW.

24:44.253 --> 24:46.516
MY NEIGHBOR SAW YOU HERE.

24:46.516 --> 24:47.957
OH, GOD.

24:47.957 --> 24:50.890
IT'S OKAY. MY SON IS GAY.
I HAVE LOTS OF GAY FRIENDS.

24:50.890 --> 24:54.023
I LOVE THE GAYS!
I JUST DON'T DATE THEM.

24:54.023 --> 24:55.965
BREE, I'M NOT GAY.

24:55.965 --> 24:57.496
HEY, STUDLY.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.498
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN A WHILE.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.931
WELL, HERE'S YOUR USUAL.

25:01.931 --> 25:03.573
I'M SORRY.
I'M OUT OF UMBRELLAS.

25:03.573 --> 25:08.778
THEY KNOW ME BECAUSE
I WORKED HERE UNDERCOVER.

25:08.778 --> 25:10.009
REALLY?

25:10.009 --> 25:12.041
YES. SOME GUYS HERE
WERE DEALING DRUGS,

25:12.041 --> 25:14.544
SO TO BLEND IN,
I PRETENDED TO BE GAY.

25:14.544 --> 25:16.015
OW!
 (slap)

25:16.015 --> 25:18.517
AND I WAS GOOD AT IT.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.149
CHUCK,
YOU DON'T NEED TO LIE.

25:20.149 --> 25:23.222
I CAN IMAGINE HOW HARD
IT MUST BE TO BE A GAY COP...

25:23.222 --> 25:28.197
ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOUR PARTNER.

25:28.197 --> 25:31.530
MY--MY PARTNER?
YOU MEAN PETER?

25:31.530 --> 25:33.733
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

25:33.733 --> 25:35.735
WELL,
I KNOW YOU TWO SPLIT UP

25:35.735 --> 25:38.537
AFTER YOU WENT
ON VACATION TOGETHER.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.010
WERE YOU IN LOVE
WITH HIM?

25:41.010 --> 25:45.244
I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT THIS HERE.

25:45.244 --> 25:47.146
COME ON.

25:51.050 --> 25:54.153
I DID LOVE PETE CROWLEY
LIKE A BROTHER.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.586
AND I LOVED MY WIFE, TOO.

25:56.586 --> 25:58.858
AT LEAST I DID...

25:58.858 --> 26:01.190
UNTIL THE CAMPING TRIP
WHEN PETE TOLD ME

26:01.190 --> 26:04.133
THEY'D BEEN SLEEPING TOGETHER
SIX MONTHS.

26:04.133 --> 26:07.967
YOUR PARTNER AND YOUR WIFE?
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

26:07.967 --> 26:11.040
I'M A DETECTIVE.
I'M SUPPOSED TO NOTICE THINGS.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.042
BUT IF YOUR WIFE
IS THE ONE WHO CHEATED,

26:13.042 --> 26:16.275
WHY IS SHE
HOLDING UP THE DIVORCE?
 PART OF ME THINKS
SHE'S DRAGGING IT OUT

26:16.275 --> 26:18.247
SO I'LL SCREW AROUND
BEFORE IT'S OVER--

26:18.247 --> 26:20.850
SO SHE CAN SAY
I'M NO BETTER THAN HER.

26:20.850 --> 26:23.252
BUT I AM BETTER THAN HER.

26:23.252 --> 26:27.857
AND THAT'S WHY I WANNA
GET THINGS RIGHT THIS TIME.

26:27.857 --> 26:32.121
SO YOU'RE REALLY NOT GAY?

26:34.093 --> 26:35.594
HMM.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.899
HMM.

26:44.774 --> 26:46.776
(exhales deeply)

26:46.776 --> 26:48.307
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

26:48.307 --> 26:51.741
FABULOUS.

26:51.741 --> 26:54.243
(man over P.A.) BRANDON
TO THE SERVICE DELI, PLEASE.

26:54.243 --> 26:56.245
BRANDON TO THE SERVICE DELI.

27:24.974 --> 27:26.275
(clatter)
 OH, MY GOD!

27:27.847 --> 27:30.419
THIS IS WHY KIDS
SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH CANS.

27:30.419 --> 27:32.251
(sighs)

27:32.251 --> 27:34.223
CHECKSTAND 1 IS NOW OPEN.

27:34.223 --> 27:37.426
CHECKSTAND 1 IS NOW OPEN,
TAKING ALL CUSTOMERS.

27:44.093 --> 27:46.335
HEY!

27:46.335 --> 27:49.298
HEY!

27:57.406 --> 27:59.408
EXCUSE ME.

27:59.408 --> 28:01.680
DO YOU HAVE
A SECURITY CAMERA?

28:04.714 --> 28:07.216
I'M CONFUSED--YOU SAY
SOMEONE TOOK YOUR POCKETBOOK,

28:07.216 --> 28:09.218
BUT ISN'T THAT
YOUR POCKETBOOK?

28:09.218 --> 28:11.120
THIS IS MY PURSE.

28:11.120 --> 28:13.222
(scoffs) MEN.
 SORRY.

28:13.222 --> 28:15.224
I DO THE SAME THING
TO MY WIFE.

28:15.224 --> 28:17.226
I SAY "NICE SHIRT."
SHE SAYS "IT'S A BLOUSE."

28:17.226 --> 28:20.229
I SAY "I LIKE YOUR TROUSERS."
SHE SAYS--
 STOP!

28:20.229 --> 28:22.301
CAN YOU GO CLOSER?

28:22.301 --> 28:25.034
OKAY. BUT HE'S NOT
HOLDING A POCKETBOOK.

28:25.034 --> 28:26.776
(key taps, beep)

28:28.307 --> 28:29.809
OH, MY GOD.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.941
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

28:31.941 --> 28:34.183
THAT'S MY STEPFATHER.

28:34.183 --> 28:36.345
YOU SOUND SURPRISED
TO SEE HIM.

28:38.347 --> 28:41.991
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD.

28:41.991 --> 28:43.352
(gunfire)

28:45.324 --> 28:46.255
(shell casings clatter)

28:46.255 --> 28:47.957
PRETTY DAMN GOOD.

28:47.957 --> 28:50.960
GOT TO ADMIT, I'M SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU BACK HERE.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.362
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU COULDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

28:53.362 --> 28:55.064
GOT OVER IT.

29:05.915 --> 29:07.476
NO, TOM,

29:07.476 --> 29:10.950
TEXTING THE OFFICE IS
THE SAME AS CALLING THE OFFICE.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.222
COME ON. YOU KNOW THAT.

29:13.222 --> 29:15.785
OH, GOD, IT'S THEM.

29:15.785 --> 29:17.857
BUT MY COFFEE--HONEY--
 LEAVE IT.

29:17.857 --> 29:21.230
HEY THERE!
TOP OF THE MORNING!
 OH! HI. YEAH, GOOD MORNING.

29:21.230 --> 29:23.232
HOW'S IT GOING?
 HI. GOOD MORNING.

29:23.232 --> 29:25.264
MWAH.
I HOPE YOU GUYS LIKE APPLES,

29:25.264 --> 29:28.197
BECAUSE WE FOUND
A PICK-YOUR-OWN APPLE ORCHARD.

29:28.197 --> 29:29.498
OH, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,

29:29.498 --> 29:31.901
WE'RE HEADING INTO TOWN
TO DO SOME ANTIQUING.

29:31.901 --> 29:34.043
OOH! SOUNDS GREAT.
WE LOVE ANTIQUING.

29:34.043 --> 29:37.546
YEAH... I THINK WE'RE GONNA GO
BY OURSELVES.

29:37.546 --> 29:39.278
OH.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.980
OUCH.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.982
ARE YOU GUYS BLOWING US OFF?

29:42.982 --> 29:44.053
NO.

29:44.053 --> 29:46.315
NO, IT'S JUST THAT
WE WANTED TO, UM,

29:46.315 --> 29:48.517
BUY ONE OF THOSE
OLD FOLDING SCREENS,

29:48.517 --> 29:50.820
AND OUR BACKSEAT
IS SO SMALL, AND YOU--

29:50.820 --> 29:52.521
LISA.

29:52.521 --> 29:55.194
YEAH, WE'RE BLOWING YOU OFF.

29:55.194 --> 29:59.268
WHY?
 LOOK, WE GET IT. YOU GUYS
CAN'T STAND TO BE ALONE.

29:59.268 --> 30:02.271
BUT THAT'S THE WHOLE REASON
WE CAME HERE, SO...

30:02.271 --> 30:06.135
NICE HANGING OUT WITH YOU,
BUT... SEE YA.

30:08.337 --> 30:10.039
AND GOOD LUCK.

30:10.039 --> 30:12.912
WH-WH-WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"GOOD LUCK"?

30:12.912 --> 30:15.214
YOU KNOW, WITH...

30:15.214 --> 30:17.947
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE WORKIN' THROUGH.

30:25.054 --> 30:28.057
(garage door whirring)

30:41.911 --> 30:43.842
(thud)
 OHH!

30:48.217 --> 30:51.220
(rainfall, thunder rumbling)

30:51.220 --> 30:55.955
MAN, THIS RAIN IS JUST
NOT GONNA STOP, HUH?

30:55.955 --> 31:02.431
THEY SAID IT MIGHT GO
INTO TONIGHT.

31:02.431 --> 31:03.592
OH, YEAH?

31:03.592 --> 31:04.863
YEAH.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.566
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID
ON THE RADIO.

31:13.202 --> 31:17.977
SO TOTAL STRANGERS
THINK WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

31:17.977 --> 31:21.210
DO YOU THINK
WE'RE IN TROUBLE?

31:21.210 --> 31:24.213
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

31:24.213 --> 31:27.216
ALL I KNOW IS, 20 YEARS AGO,
IF YOU'D PUT US

31:27.216 --> 31:30.920
IN A BEAUTIFUL ROOM
WITH A FIREPLACE AND A BIG BED

31:30.920 --> 31:33.492
AND IT RAINED ALL DAY...

31:33.492 --> 31:35.324
(rainfall continues)

31:35.324 --> 31:38.197
WE WOULDN'T BE TALKING
ABOUT THE WEATHER.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.313
I GO--I GOTTA GET
OUT OF THIS ROOM.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.345
I'M JUST--I'M STARTING
TO LOSE MY MIND.

31:56.345 --> 31:58.117
YOU WANNA TAKE A WALK?
 WHAT?

31:58.117 --> 32:01.390
DO YOU WANNA TAKE A WALK?
 IT'S A MESS OUT THERE.
IT'S POURING.

32:01.390 --> 32:04.393
WELL, DON'T SNAP AT ME, TOM.
SNAP AT THE RAIN.

32:04.393 --> 32:07.356
GOD. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE NOT
EVEN TRYING.

32:07.356 --> 32:10.299
ME? I'M NOT TRYING?

32:10.299 --> 32:14.403
FROM WHERE I SIT,
YOU'RE NOT.

32:14.403 --> 32:17.166
WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS?

32:17.166 --> 32:18.937
WHAT IS THIS?

32:18.937 --> 32:21.170
IT'S YOUR ENGAGEMENT RING--

32:21.170 --> 32:24.243
THE CRAPPY ONE I GAVE YOU
A MILLION YEARS AGO.

32:29.418 --> 32:32.281
YOU CHANGED THE DIAMOND.

32:32.281 --> 32:35.624
I TOLD YOU I'D GIVE YOU
A DECENT RING SOMEDAY.

32:37.426 --> 32:40.359
THERE IT IS.

32:42.691 --> 32:45.134
MM.

32:45.134 --> 32:47.636
(box snaps shut)

32:47.636 --> 32:50.469
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

32:50.469 --> 32:53.502
I APPRECIATE THIS.
I REALLY DO.

32:53.502 --> 32:55.374
BUT...

32:55.374 --> 32:58.007
I LOVED THE RING
THE WAY IT WAS.

32:58.007 --> 32:59.578
REALLY?

32:59.578 --> 33:02.411
'CAUSE I SEEM TO REMEMBER
YOU MAKING A JOKE ABOUT IT

33:02.411 --> 33:05.654
EVERY SINGLE TIME
YOU SHOWED IT TO SOMEBODY.

33:05.654 --> 33:08.117
I DID?

33:09.558 --> 33:13.722
I-I DID.

33:15.394 --> 33:18.727
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I DIDN'T LOVE IT.

33:18.727 --> 33:22.000
LYNETTE, I DID THIS
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.002
BUT I'M RUNNING
OUT OF IDEAS!

33:27.406 --> 33:29.338
(sighs)

33:29.338 --> 33:32.010
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

33:39.188 --> 33:45.454
WE HAVE SURVIVED FIVE KIDS,
A FAILED BUSINESS, CANCER.

33:47.396 --> 33:50.499
WHY CAN'T
WE PULL OUT OF THIS ONE?

33:50.499 --> 33:54.263
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

33:57.236 --> 34:00.269
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT.

34:05.314 --> 34:07.546
I JUST KNOW IT ISN'T THIS.

34:19.388 --> 34:21.159
(click)

34:23.262 --> 34:25.094
THERE YOU GO.

34:25.094 --> 34:27.496
WAKEY-WAKEY.

34:27.496 --> 34:30.299
NOW I'M GONNA TAKE THIS OFF,

34:30.299 --> 34:32.301
BUT IF YOU START
SCREAMING FOR HELP,

34:32.301 --> 34:36.574
I WILL HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO PLUNGE THIS

34:36.574 --> 34:38.577
DIRECTLY INTO YOUR HEART,

34:38.577 --> 34:42.150
KILLING YOU INSTANTLY.

34:42.150 --> 34:46.755
OH, THAT'LL KILL YOU, TOO,
BUT A LOT MORE SLOWLY,

34:46.755 --> 34:49.658
GIVING THE THREE OF US
A CHANCE TO CHAT.

34:49.658 --> 34:50.859
(rip)

34:53.592 --> 34:56.295
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"THE THREE OF US"?

34:56.295 --> 34:57.426
WHO'S HERE?

34:57.426 --> 35:00.799
WHY, BETH, OF COURSE.

35:00.799 --> 35:05.103
I KNEW SHE WOULDN'T
WANT TO MISS THIS.

35:05.103 --> 35:09.178
FINE. KILL ME.
YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH IT.

35:09.178 --> 35:11.180
THE POLICE KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN POISONING ME.

35:11.180 --> 35:15.484
BUT THANKS TO YOU,
THEY THINK I'M MILES AWAY.

35:15.484 --> 35:18.187
BUT I'M NOT.

35:18.187 --> 35:21.350
I'M RIGHT HERE.

35:31.700 --> 35:34.433
YOU KNOW, I'M KINDA
GONNA MISS THIS PLACE.

35:34.433 --> 35:37.206
YEAH. THE SOUND OF
GERMAN TECHNO MUSIC FROM 3B.

35:37.206 --> 35:39.838
SMELL OF CORNED BEEF AND CABBAGE
FROM 2C.

35:39.838 --> 35:42.511
THE FAT GUY--
OR IS IT A WOMAN?--IN 5D.

35:42.511 --> 35:44.673
(laughs) ACTUALLY, I'M NOT
GONNA MISS THIS PLACE.

35:44.673 --> 35:47.376
HEY, WHERE'S THIS GO?
 OH, M.J.'s TOYS ARE HERE.

35:47.376 --> 35:49.378
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE
A GREAT IDEA?

35:49.378 --> 35:52.181
IF WHEN HE WALKS IN
TO HIS OLD ROOM TOMORROW,

35:52.181 --> 35:54.483
ALL OF HIS FAVORITE THINGS
ARE ALREADY THERE?

35:54.483 --> 35:57.486
YEAH, HE'D LOVE THAT.
I'LL RUN 'EM OVER RIGHT NOW.

35:57.486 --> 36:00.429
NO, NO, NO. YOU KEEP PACKING.
I'LL GO.

36:00.429 --> 36:01.830
(liquid dripping)

36:01.830 --> 36:03.462
(breathing deeply)

36:03.462 --> 36:05.734
YOU DISAPPOINT ME, PAUL.

36:05.734 --> 36:08.567
IS THIS REALLY HOW YOU WANNA
SPEND YOUR LAST MOMENTS?

36:08.567 --> 36:10.569
SITTING HERE
SHOOTING ME DIRTY LOOKS

36:10.569 --> 36:14.343
AS IF I DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW
YOU DISLIKE ME.

36:14.343 --> 36:16.445
WHAT WOULD YOU PREFER?

36:16.445 --> 36:19.808
SOME REMORSE.
A LITTLE REPENTANCE.

36:19.808 --> 36:22.551
EMOTIONS APPROPRIATE TO A MAN
WHO KILLED AN INNOCENT WOMAN.

36:22.551 --> 36:25.884
INNOCENT? YOUR SISTER
BLACKMAILED MY WIFE--

36:25.884 --> 36:28.657
DROVE HER TO SUICIDE.
(coughs)

36:28.657 --> 36:31.720
IT ISN'T MARTHA'S FAULT
THAT MARY ALICE SHOT HERSELF,

36:31.720 --> 36:34.192
LIKE ALL YOUR WIVES SEEM TO.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.365
IF YOU'RE GONNA
KEEP TALKING, FELICIA,

36:36.365 --> 36:39.268
WOULD YOU MIND
UPPING MY DOSE?

36:39.268 --> 36:43.602
JUST TELL ME YOU'RE SORRY!
IS IT REALLY SO HARD TO SAY?

36:43.602 --> 36:45.504
I'M NOT SORRY.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.906
I WASN'T THEN,
AND I'M NOT NOW.

36:47.906 --> 36:51.740
WHEN I SAW THE LIFE DRAIN OUT
OF MARTHA'S MEAN LITTLE EYES,

36:51.740 --> 36:55.213
I KNEW SHE WAS GETTING
EXACTLY WHAT SHE DESERVED.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.687
SO THERE IT IS.

37:02.721 --> 37:06.395
(beeps)

37:06.395 --> 37:08.627
WHEN I WATCHED THE LIFE DRAIN

37:08.627 --> 37:11.330
OUT OF MARTHA'S
MEAN LITTLE EYES,

37:11.330 --> 37:14.903
I KNEW SHE WAS GETTING
EXACTLY WHAT SHE DESERVED.

37:16.405 --> 37:17.406
(beep)

37:17.406 --> 37:19.408
SO YOU HAVE A CONFESSION.

37:19.408 --> 37:22.511
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO,
ARREST MY CORPSE?

37:22.511 --> 37:24.773
NO.

37:24.773 --> 37:27.476
BUT WHEN THE POLICE
FIND YOUR BODY,

37:27.476 --> 37:30.279
THEY'LL FIND THIS.

37:30.279 --> 37:33.522
AND THE WORLD WILL STOP THINKING
I WAS CRAZY ALL THESE YEARS.

37:33.522 --> 37:36.455
FELICIA...

37:36.455 --> 37:39.488
THERE'S ONE THING
I'LL GO TO MY GRAVE SURE OF--

37:39.488 --> 37:42.631
THE WORLD WILL NEVER STOP
THINKING YOU'RE CRAZY.

37:46.435 --> 37:49.768
(crickets chirping)

37:51.600 --> 37:54.473
(keys jangle)

37:56.345 --> 37:58.407
AHH.

37:58.407 --> 38:00.509
(Paul coughs weakly)

38:00.509 --> 38:04.513
(Felicia speaking indistinctly)

38:04.513 --> 38:07.285
(keys jangle)

38:11.490 --> 38:13.722
(click)

38:15.364 --> 38:17.626
GETTING SCARED, PAUL?

38:17.626 --> 38:19.428
THIS POISON--

38:19.428 --> 38:21.430
HOW MUCH LONGER
BEFORE IT KILLS ME?

38:21.430 --> 38:22.771
NOT LONG.

38:22.771 --> 38:24.903
30 MINUTES OR SO.

38:31.980 --> 38:35.984
(cell phone opens,
keypad beeping)

38:35.984 --> 38:37.986
(woman) 9-1-1.
State your emergency.

38:37.986 --> 38:40.549
(whispering) THERE'S A KILLER
LOOSE IN MY HOUSE.

38:40.549 --> 38:42.951
4353 WISTERIA LANE.
SEND POLICE...

38:42.951 --> 38:46.495
AND AN AMBULANCE. HURRY!
(sighs)

38:46.495 --> 38:47.796
(cell phone shuts)

38:55.564 --> 38:59.668
(singsongy)
OOH. GETTING WEAKER.

38:59.668 --> 39:02.441
(normal voice)
TELL MARTHA...

39:02.441 --> 39:03.872
I SAID HELLO.

39:03.872 --> 39:06.875
(siren wailing)

39:13.852 --> 39:16.655
SUSAN! SUSAN!

39:16.655 --> 39:18.857
OHH. OH.

39:23.592 --> 39:25.464
HURRY. HURRY!

39:38.046 --> 39:41.049
(siren wailing)

39:52.020 --> 39:55.594
(panting)
COME ON, COME ON.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.496
UHH!
 OHH!

39:59.528 --> 40:01.600
OH, SUSAN...

40:01.600 --> 40:03.572
IF YOUR CASSEROLES
HAD BEEN ANY BETTER,

40:03.572 --> 40:05.073
HE WOULD HAVE HAD SECONDS.

40:05.073 --> 40:07.736
AND NONE OF THIS
WOULD BE HAPPENING!

40:07.736 --> 40:08.937
UHH!
 AAH!

40:08.937 --> 40:10.178
NO!

40:10.178 --> 40:11.880
UHH!
 (rip)

40:11.880 --> 40:14.613
AAH!

40:14.613 --> 40:16.445
(rip)
 (panting)

40:16.445 --> 40:18.787
AAH! AAH!

40:18.787 --> 40:20.589
UHH!

40:20.589 --> 40:22.190
(gasps)

40:22.190 --> 40:24.523
THIS HAS GONE ON
LONG ENOUGH!

40:24.523 --> 40:26.555
(choking)

40:26.555 --> 40:27.556
PAUL!

40:27.556 --> 40:29.798
PAUL, STOP.

40:29.798 --> 40:33.502
DON'T DO THIS.
PAUL, LET HER GO!

40:33.502 --> 40:36.835
YOU ARE NOT LIKE HER.
YOU ARE NOT A KILLER!

40:36.835 --> 40:39.468
(continues choking)

40:39.468 --> 40:41.570
(gasping)

40:41.570 --> 40:43.942
(exhales)

40:47.546 --> 40:49.618
(door opens)

40:49.618 --> 40:51.049
(door closes)

40:51.049 --> 40:54.022
THANK YOU.

40:54.022 --> 40:55.684
(siren wailing in distance)

40:55.684 --> 40:59.658
THANK YOU, SUSAN.

40:59.658 --> 41:03.562
(siren continues wailing,
tires screech)

41:03.562 --> 41:05.534
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T HURT HER.
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.

41:05.534 --> 41:07.766
STOP SAYING THAT.

41:10.238 --> 41:11.700
FELICIA'S RIGHT.

41:13.842 --> 41:15.944
I KILLED MARTHA.

41:18.877 --> 41:22.110
THE MAN YOU THINK I AM...

41:22.110 --> 41:25.584
I HAVEN'T BEEN HIM
FOR A LONG TIME.

41:25.584 --> 41:28.186
BUT I WANT TO BE
THAT MAN AGAIN.

41:28.186 --> 41:31.620
(police radio chatter)

41:31.620 --> 41:36.525
OFFICERS, CAN YOU TAKE
MY STATEMENT?

41:41.129 --> 41:43.902
I HAVE A CONFESSION
TO MAKE.

41:49.838 --> 41:52.541
A SENSE OF SECURITY--

41:52.541 --> 41:55.884
IT'S SOMETHING
WE ALL SEARCH FOR...

41:58.016 --> 42:01.720
WHETHER IT'S KNOWING
WE'RE DESIRED...

42:01.720 --> 42:05.724
TAKING CONTROL OF OUR FEARS...

42:08.557 --> 42:13.662
OR FINDING THE STRENGTH
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

42:17.736 --> 42:21.610
BUT THE DANGER
OF A SENSE OF SECURITY

42:21.610 --> 42:23.712
IS THAT IT MAY PROVE...

42:23.712 --> 42:26.014
TO BE FALSE.

42:27.616 --> 42:29.017
(clank)

42:29.017 --> 42:30.719
OH!

42:30.719 --> 42:32.881
(tires screeching)

42:32.881 --> 42:35.654
(coughing)

42:35.654 --> 42:37.555
(tires screech)

42:37.555 --> 42:40.088
(truck horn blows)

42:40.088 --> 42:41.229
(tires screech)

42:41.229 --> 42:42.691
(crash)
