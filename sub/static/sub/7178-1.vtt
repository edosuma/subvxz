ALL RIGHT, MEAN.

02:29.375 --> 02:30.917
TELL ME I'M GOING TO
COACH GIRLS' TRACK

02:30.917 --> 02:32.875
FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE.

02:32.875 --> 02:35.417
THIS GAG PHOTO
WAS YOUR IDEA.

02:38.708 --> 02:40.542
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

02:40.542 --> 02:41.875
YOU'RE USING
MY UNIFORM!

02:41.875 --> 02:43.583
OH, MOLL.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.250
DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS YOU.

02:45.250 --> 02:47.583
NO PROBLEM. ANYTIME YOU
WANNA GET INTO MY PANTS,

02:47.583 --> 02:49.667
JUST ASK.

02:49.667 --> 02:51.250
NEVER HAD SISTERS BEFORE.

02:52.583 --> 02:53.917
WHAT A GUY.

02:53.917 --> 02:56.583
KEEP YOUR STRIDE
NICE AND EASY.

02:56.583 --> 02:58.708
GET YOUR ARMS DOWN!

02:58.708 --> 03:01.583
MOLL, OUR FEARLESS LEADER
HAS RETURNED.

03:01.583 --> 03:02.917
WHO?
WALKER.

03:04.417 --> 03:06.458
ASK HIM NOW
BEFORE SOMEBODY ELSE DOES.

03:06.458 --> 03:08.458
GO GET HIM, TIGER!

03:09.542 --> 03:10.750
DR. WALKER.

03:12.667 --> 03:15.667
MISS McGRATH!

03:15.667 --> 03:16.959
FOR A SECOND,
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE BUBBA SMITH.

03:16.959 --> 03:18.208
OH!

03:19.708 --> 03:21.917
YOU LOOK FINE, GIRLS.

03:21.917 --> 03:23.625
GET THOSE ARMS UP.

03:24.917 --> 03:26.625
WELL, HOW WAS THE
PRINCIPALS CONFERENCE?

03:26.625 --> 03:28.125
OH, I...

03:29.625 --> 03:30.917
VERY STIMULATING.

03:30.917 --> 03:33.458
GOOD. GOOD.

03:33.458 --> 03:37.917
DR. WALKER,
WHEN YOU WERE AWAY,

03:37.917 --> 03:39.458
NICK MARTINELLI WENT IN
FOR A DOUBLE HERNIA.

03:41.542 --> 03:44.750
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO COACH
JV FOOTBALL THIS YEAR,

03:44.750 --> 03:47.959
AND I'D, WELL,
I'D LIKE THE JOB.

03:50.125 --> 03:51.125
I TELL YOU WHAT.

03:52.208 --> 03:54.625
RUN IT BY DAN DARWELL.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.125
IF HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY OBJECTIONS,

03:57.542 --> 03:59.083
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

03:59.083 --> 04:01.500
KEEP THOSE KNEES PUMPING!

04:02.750 --> 04:04.083
KNEES AND ARMS, GIRLS.

04:05.792 --> 04:07.375
I GOT TO ASK DAN.

04:07.375 --> 04:09.125
OH, WELL,
THE WORST HE COULD
DO IS SAY NO.

04:09.125 --> 04:10.792
HE COULD SAY
"NO, BABES.

04:11.959 --> 04:14.542
YOU KNOW THE BEST WAY
TO DO THIS?

04:14.542 --> 04:17.875
DON'T TALK TO HIM
ABOUT IT NOW.

04:17.875 --> 04:21.333
TELL HIM YOU WANT TO
MEET HIM LATER,
SORT OF A DATE.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.000
I'M NOT GOING
ON A DATE WITH HIM.

04:26.291 --> 04:28.458
PLAY A GAME
OF RACQUETBALL.

04:28.458 --> 04:29.875
THE GUY IS DISGUSTING.

04:31.542 --> 04:33.625
DO YOU WANT TO
COACH FOOTBALL?

04:33.625 --> 04:36.000
I HAVE TO
PICK THE KIDS UP.
I'LL PICK THE KIDS UP.

04:42.375 --> 04:43.667
I'M WARMED UP.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.500
O.K. READY?

04:47.834 --> 04:49.166
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU, DAN.

04:49.166 --> 04:50.166
SURE, BABES.
HOW ABOUT OVER DINNER?

04:51.166 --> 04:52.542
HOW ABOUT
OVER RACQUETBALL?

04:54.083 --> 04:57.542
A QUICK SET,
THEN DINNER.

04:57.542 --> 04:59.000
WE'LL PLAY TO 5.
LADIES FIRST.
YOU SERVE.

05:04.375 --> 05:06.000
I WANT TO COACH
THE JV, DAN.

05:09.750 --> 05:11.708
MOLLY, A GIRL CAN'T
COACH BOYS' FOOTBALL.

05:11.708 --> 05:13.041
YOU KNOW THAT.

05:13.041 --> 05:14.375
NO, I DON'T.

05:15.875 --> 05:17.500
DAN, I CAN HANDLE THIS.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.917
HEADS UP!

05:20.500 --> 05:21.708
1-ZIP.

05:21.708 --> 05:24.542
HIT THE BALL,
NOT THE WALL.

05:24.542 --> 05:26.917
I WAS RAISED ON FOOTBALL.
I KNOW MORE ABOUT IT

05:26.917 --> 05:29.208
THAN ANYBODY
YOU COULD GET.

05:29.208 --> 05:30.667
I MEAN,
COACHING TO ME--

05:30.667 --> 05:31.834
HEADS UP!

05:33.333 --> 05:34.417
OH!

05:36.542 --> 05:39.083
YOU KNOW
I'M QUALIFIED, DAN.

05:39.083 --> 05:42.250
I'VE KNOWN YOU
AND DR. WALKER
A LONG TIME NOW.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.583
YOU WOULDN'T DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST A WOMAN.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.750
YOU KNOW ME, BABES,
I'M A MODERN GUY,

05:48.750 --> 05:51.000
BUT, WALKER,
I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S SEE WHAT HE SAYS.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.917
WE'LL MEET WITH HIM
MONDAY.
THANKS, DAN.

06:03.083 --> 06:04.083
SHIT!

06:06.625 --> 06:08.083
WHAT'S THE SCORE?

06:08.083 --> 06:09.208
2-1, MINE.

06:11.917 --> 06:13.125
IT'S 3-1, YOURS.

06:13.417 --> 06:15.125
OH!

06:26.792 --> 06:29.250
OH, DAN, I'M SORRY.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.291
I'M REALLY SORRY.
ARE YOU O.K.?

06:31.291 --> 06:33.917
I'M FINE.

06:33.917 --> 06:35.166
WE'LL PLAY AGAIN
WHEN I DON'T HAVE
A HEADACHE.

06:37.291 --> 06:39.458
YOU'RE NOT SORE?
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

06:39.458 --> 06:41.208
WE'RE STILL GOING TO
MEET WITH WALKER?

06:41.208 --> 06:43.625
YEAH, FIRST THING
MONDAY MORNING.

06:44.458 --> 06:47.792
O.K. YOU'RE NOT UPSET?

06:47.792 --> 06:49.500
I'M FINE.
GET OUT OF HERE,
YOU KNUCKLEHEAD.

06:49.959 --> 06:51.125
O.K.

07:00.834 --> 07:02.166
OW!

07:03.125 --> 07:04.959
YEAH. GO TEAM.

07:04.959 --> 07:06.875
THROW THE BALL!

07:06.875 --> 07:09.708
MOM, I LOST
MY SNEAKER.

07:09.708 --> 07:13.000
VERNA, I FOUND
DAD'S PLAYBOOKS.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.500
ALICE, HELP YOUR SISTER
FIND HER SHOE.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.500
SHE'S 6. YOU'RE 13.
AS YOU GET OLDER,
LIFE GETS TOUGHER.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.166
LOOK AT THE WAY
DAD BLOCKED
THE SWEEP SERIES.

07:24.166 --> 07:26.333
HE WAS WAY AHEAD
OF HIS TIME.

07:26.333 --> 07:27.708
I LOVE THIS PLAY.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.834
MOM, I FOUND
MARIAN'S SHOE.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.834
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY HAD IT.

07:34.834 --> 07:37.083
LITTLE SON OF A BITCH ALSO
ATE MY DURAN DURAN ALBUM.

07:37.083 --> 07:38.542
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

07:38.542 --> 07:41.000
VERNA SAID IT'S OK
TO CALL A DOG
A SON OF A BITCH,

07:41.000 --> 07:42.166
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT HE IS.

07:42.166 --> 07:43.542
VERNA.

07:43.542 --> 07:45.166
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I SAID THAT,

07:45.166 --> 07:46.750
BUT IT IS LINGUISTICALLY
CORRECT.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.208
[DOORBELL RINGS]
I GOT IT.

07:53.542 --> 07:55.000
HEY, FRANK.
HEY, VERNA.

07:56.708 --> 07:57.959
HOW YOU DOING?

07:57.959 --> 07:59.417
MY LIPS ARE ABOVE
THE WATER LINE.

08:00.750 --> 08:01.875
HEY, MOLL.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.875
HI.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.792
HEY, WHAT'S
WITH ALL THAT?

08:05.792 --> 08:07.708
FINALLY
THROWING THAT OUT?

08:07.708 --> 08:10.208
YEAH, I'M JUST
THROWING THAT OUT.
DADDY!

08:12.542 --> 08:14.500
HI, SWEETIE.
HEY, MUFFINHEAD.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.583
WHOA!

08:16.917 --> 08:18.083
KIDS!

08:18.083 --> 08:19.708
WE'RE GOING
SHOPPING.

08:19.708 --> 08:22.917
GUYS, CALL ME
EVERY NIGHT, O.K.?

08:22.917 --> 08:24.291
IT'S JUST THE WEEKEND.

08:24.291 --> 08:26.375
WELL, HUMOR ME.
BYE, BABY.

08:28.417 --> 08:30.875
BYE, MOM.
SEE YOU SUNDAY.

08:30.875 --> 08:33.417
BYE, HONEY.
I LOVE YOU. BYE.

08:35.792 --> 08:38.041
STEPHANIE'S PARENTS
ARE HAVING A COCKTAIL PARTY,

08:38.041 --> 08:40.875
SO I'LL DROP THE KIDS OFF
EARLIER THAN USUAL.

08:40.875 --> 08:42.750
O.K.? THANKS.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.542
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HIM
ABOUT THE COACHING?

08:47.542 --> 08:50.875
I KNOW HIM. HE'D TRY
TO TALK ME OUT OF IT.

08:50.875 --> 08:53.792
I DECIDED TO GET TOUGH,
STAND UP TO HIM...

08:53.792 --> 08:55.250
AND DENY IT.

08:56.959 --> 09:00.166
I'LL TELL HIM MONDAY
AFTER I GET THE JOB.

09:00.166 --> 09:03.792
I'M SORRY. IF THE POSITION
HAS BEEN FILLED,

09:03.792 --> 09:05.959
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO.

09:05.959 --> 09:08.166
COACH DARWELL IS PERFECTLY
WITHIN HIS RIGHTS

09:08.166 --> 09:10.333
TO SELECT MR. REMO
AS HIS JV COACH.

09:10.333 --> 09:11.834
BUT HE'S THE HOME EC
TEACHER.

09:11.834 --> 09:14.083
AND A DARN GOOD ONE!

09:14.083 --> 09:16.917
MR. REMO, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT A NICKEL DEFENSE IS,

09:16.917 --> 09:18.959
AN OPEN SET FORMATION,

09:18.959 --> 09:20.250
OR WHEN TO USE
A SAFETY BLITZ?

09:20.917 --> 09:22.125
I CAN'T SAY I DO.

09:23.542 --> 09:25.166
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO GET
GOOD PENETRATION?

09:27.625 --> 09:29.625
MISS McGRATH, PLEASE.

09:29.625 --> 09:30.667
WE'RE DRIFTING OFF
THE SUBJECT NOW.

09:32.291 --> 09:34.458
SORRY I'M LATE.
WHAT DID I MISS?

09:34.458 --> 09:36.000
DR. WALKER
WAS EXPLAINING

09:36.000 --> 09:38.917
WHY YOU
PICKED SOMEONE

09:38.917 --> 09:41.000
WHO DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT FOOTBALL.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.083
YOU REALLY WANT
TO COACH FOOTBALL?

09:43.834 --> 09:45.667
FINE, YOU GOT IT.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.166
YOU SAID
I COULD COACH JV.

09:47.166 --> 09:48.333
SHE'S GOING TO
COACH VARSITY,

09:50.000 --> 09:51.875
THE BIG "V."
WHAT?

09:51.875 --> 09:53.792
JESUS. DON'T--
AT CENTRAL HIGH.

09:55.875 --> 09:56.875
OH, MY GOD!

10:01.166 --> 10:04.208
IF MISS McGRATH IS WILLING
TO TAKE NO BONUS,
THEY'D LOVE TO HAVE HER.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.166
HERE'S THE PRINCIPAL'S
NUMBER. BEN EDWARDS.

10:10.625 --> 10:12.667
I DON'T THINK CENTRAL
IS THE RIGHT PLACE
FOR A WOMAN.

10:13.834 --> 10:14.834
SHE CAN HANDLE IT.

10:16.875 --> 10:19.417
MAYBE A WOMAN'S TOUCH
IS WHAT THEY NEED.

10:19.417 --> 10:21.041
AFTER SHE
TEACHES THEM TO SIT,

10:21.041 --> 10:22.625
SHE CAN TAKE THE THORNS
OUT OF THEIR PAWS.

10:28.542 --> 10:30.458
YOU THINK THAT'S REAL FUNNY.

10:30.458 --> 10:31.375
YES.

10:32.291 --> 10:34.417
O.K.

10:34.417 --> 10:36.166
O.K., LAUGHING BOY.

10:37.875 --> 10:39.500
WELL, HA HA HA!

10:41.375 --> 10:43.875
I'M GOING TO
TAKE THAT JOB.

10:43.875 --> 10:45.542
YOU THINK A WOMAN
CAN'T BE TOUGH ENOUGH?

10:47.291 --> 10:50.333
WELL, I'LL SHOW YOU TOUGH.

FOR 10 BUCKS.

01:22:05.333 --> 01:22:06.667
KEEP YOUR FAT ASS
OUT OF THIS!

01:22:08.166 --> 01:22:09.291
FRANK!

01:22:11.792 --> 01:22:12.959
NO CHARGE.

01:22:26.166 --> 01:22:30.708
MOMMY, I CAN FEEL
THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH.

01:22:32.041 --> 01:22:34.125
YOU'RE PLASTERED,
ALICE.

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:43.625
JUST GET THIS
OVER WITH.

01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:50.208
WALT, SHOULDN'T WE
BE WHISPERING, TOO?

01:22:52.959 --> 01:22:55.458
WE'RE ON OUR OWN
10-YARD LINE.

01:22:55.458 --> 01:22:57.375
WE MAY HAVE TO
PUNT, MOLLY.

01:22:57.375 --> 01:22:59.667
OH, DON'T USE
FOOTBALL ANALOGIES NOW.

01:22:59.667 --> 01:23:00.750
TALK LIKE
A LAWYER, O.K.?

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:03.250
THE MOST SERIOUS
ALLEGATIONS

01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:05.041
ARE THAT YOUR
OLDER DAUGHTER ALICE

01:23:05.041 --> 01:23:06.542
WAS INJURED IN A FIGHT,

01:23:06.542 --> 01:23:09.166
WHICH OCCURRED DURING
A PARTY HELD AT YOUR HOME

01:23:09.166 --> 01:23:10.917
ON THE NIGHT
OF SEPTEMBER 30th,

01:23:10.917 --> 01:23:13.625
AND THAT MINORS WERE
SEEN THERE DRINKING BEER,

01:23:13.625 --> 01:23:16.083
AND THAT YOUR OLDER DAUGHTER
BECAME INTOXICATED

01:23:16.083 --> 01:23:18.250
AT ANOTHER PARTY
ATTENDED BY YOU,

01:23:18.250 --> 01:23:20.083
AND WAS THEN DRIVEN HOME
BY A COUPLE

01:23:20.083 --> 01:23:23.208
WHOM YOUR EX-HUSBAND SAW
HAVING INTERCOURSE

01:23:23.208 --> 01:23:24.166
IN YOUR LIVING ROOM.

01:23:25.708 --> 01:23:27.542
THE WAY THEY
MAKE IT SOUND,

01:23:27.542 --> 01:23:29.125
I'D
RULE
AGAINST ME.

01:23:29.125 --> 01:23:31.750
THE OPERA ISN'T OVER
UNTIL THE FAT LADY SINGS.

01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:33.083
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

01:23:33.083 --> 01:23:35.250
WOULD MISS McGRATH
CARE TO MAKE A STATEMENT

01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:37.583
BEFORE I RULE
ON THIS PETITION?

01:23:37.583 --> 01:23:38.750
SHE WOULD, YOUR HONOR.

01:23:39.959 --> 01:23:41.792
JUST DRIVE STRAIGHT UP
THE MIDDLE.

01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:47.750
YOUR HONOR,
ALICE AND MARIAN

01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:49.708
ARE MORE VALUABLE
TO ME THAN ANYTHING.

01:23:51.792 --> 01:23:53.625
I LOVE THEM
VERY MUCH.

01:23:53.625 --> 01:23:55.792
YOUR LOVE
FOR YOUR CHILDREN
IS NOT AT ISSUE HERE.

01:24:01.083 --> 01:24:04.125
HE SAYS I'M NOT GOOD
FOR MY OWN CHILDREN!

01:24:04.125 --> 01:24:05.625
MR. NEEDHAM
MERELY CLAIMS

01:24:05.625 --> 01:24:07.834
THAT MISS McGRATH'S
COACHING JOB

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.083
JEOPARDIZES THE WELL-BEING
OF HIS DAUGHTERS.

01:24:12.083 --> 01:24:13.291
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

01:24:16.458 --> 01:24:18.291
HE ARRANGED FOR A JOB
FOR MISS McGRATH

01:24:18.291 --> 01:24:19.959
AT A VERY FINE SCHOOL.

01:24:21.959 --> 01:24:23.917
SHE REJECTED IT
WITH A PROFANITY.

01:24:25.834 --> 01:24:27.959
NOW, WAIT JUST A SECOND.

01:24:27.959 --> 01:24:29.417
HE TRIED TO TRICK ME
INTO QUITTING

01:24:29.417 --> 01:24:31.792
THE ONE THING THAT I
TOOK PRIDE IN DOING,

01:24:31.792 --> 01:24:33.208
IN ORDER TO TEACH
JAZZERCISE

01:24:33.208 --> 01:24:35.750
TO A BUNCH OF
OVERPRIVILEGED GIRLS,

01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:36.917
SO I CALLED HIM
A MOTHERFUCKER.

01:24:40.458 --> 01:24:42.959
WHICH IS
LINGUISTICALLY CORRECT

01:24:44.166 --> 01:24:45.750
BECAUSE I...
I'M A MOTHER...

01:24:48.291 --> 01:24:50.500
AND HE USED TO...

01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:55.000
YOUR HONOR, I'D LIKE
TO BREAK TESTIMONY NOW

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.625
AND INTRODUCE
INTO THE RECORD

01:24:56.625 --> 01:24:58.500
SOME CHARACTER WITNESS
TESTIMONY.

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:01.000
IF IT'S RELEVANT,
I WILL HEAR THE WITNESS.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:01.959
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:25:11.667 --> 01:25:13.208
IT'S THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:15.125
ARE YOU ALL
CHARACTER WITNESSES?

01:25:15.125 --> 01:25:16.667
WE PROMISE TO TELL
THE WHOLE TRUTH,

01:25:16.667 --> 01:25:18.875
AND THAT'S NO LIE,
YOUR HONOR.

01:25:19.542 --> 01:25:21.041
SEE, YOUR HONOR,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.875
IT'S WRONG TO TAKE THE KIDS
AWAY FROM COACH.

01:25:27.875 --> 01:25:29.959
I WISH I HAD A MOTHER
LIKE HER.

01:25:29.959 --> 01:25:32.333
YOU WISH
YOU  H AD
A MOTHER.

01:25:32.333 --> 01:25:34.166
THIS IS SERIOUS.
CHILL, MAN.

01:25:35.542 --> 01:25:36.542
MAY I APPROACH
THE BENCH?

01:25:36.542 --> 01:25:37.667
YES.

01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:41.542
THE POINT IS,

01:25:44.083 --> 01:25:46.250
EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN
PLAYIN' FOOTBALL
FOR HER,

01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:48.208
I'VE BEEN
TOTALLY STRAIGHT.

01:25:48.208 --> 01:25:51.417
IF WE FUC--
IF WE FOULED UP,

01:25:51.417 --> 01:25:52.708
WE WERE OFF
THE TEAM.

01:25:54.417 --> 01:25:56.291
ANY WOOL GOOD-LOOKIN'
AS YOURSELF

01:25:56.291 --> 01:25:57.542
SHOULDN'T BE
WASTIN' HER TIME.

01:26:01.583 --> 01:26:03.000
WE CAN WORK THIS OUT.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.125
DON'T YOU GOT
A CHAMBER AROUND HERE

01:26:05.125 --> 01:26:07.208
WHERE WE CAN GO AND--

01:26:07.208 --> 01:26:10.917
I DON'T SEE WHERE THIS
TESTIMONY IS RELEVANT.

01:26:10.917 --> 01:26:12.750
IT'S RELEVANT
RIGHT FUCKING HERE.

01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:17.583
ORDER! ORDER!

01:26:18.917 --> 01:26:21.250
YOU SUCKERS
THINK YOU'RE BAD?

01:26:21.250 --> 01:26:24.417
KEEP IT UP, AND I'LL
HOLD YOU IN CONTEMPT!

01:26:24.417 --> 01:26:26.542
NOW, SIT DOWN, TURKEYS!

01:26:26.542 --> 01:26:27.750
SEE WHAT
YOU DID, MAN?

01:26:32.708 --> 01:26:34.834
IF MISS McGRATH PERSISTS

01:26:34.834 --> 01:26:38.083
IN ASSOCIATING
WITH THIS TEAM,

01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:39.542
THEN PETITIONER
MUST REQUEST

01:26:39.542 --> 01:26:41.417
NOT ONLY
IMMEDIATE CUSTODY,

01:26:43.166 --> 01:26:45.792
BUT THAT SHE FORFEIT
VISITATION PRIVILEGES

01:26:45.792 --> 01:26:46.959
DURING
THE FOOTBALL SEASON

01:26:46.959 --> 01:26:48.458
AND THAT
THE CHILDREN BE ENJOINED

01:26:48.458 --> 01:26:51.250
FROM ATTENDING GAMES
AT ANY TIME.

01:26:53.583 --> 01:26:54.959
WAIT, WAIT, STOP.

01:26:57.667 --> 01:26:58.792
ALL RIGHT, FRANK,
YOU WIN.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.792
NEXT SEMESTER,
I QUIT COACHING,

01:27:01.792 --> 01:27:02.959
AND I TEACH
AT CHATHAM.

01:27:05.625 --> 01:27:07.333
NOW CALL
THIS THING OFF, OK?

01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:11.625
TAKE IT QUICK.

01:27:14.041 --> 01:27:14.959
YOU JUMPED
OUT OF BOUNDS.

01:27:14.959 --> 01:27:16.583
SHUT UP.

01:27:16.583 --> 01:27:18.000
I CAN'T RISK
LOSING MY GIRLS.

01:27:20.125 --> 01:27:22.291
THE PLAINTIFF ACCEPTS
RESPONDENT'S OFFER.

01:27:22.291 --> 01:27:24.250
MS. McGRATH, ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT?

01:27:29.208 --> 01:27:30.083
YES.

01:27:32.667 --> 01:27:34.166
MAY I LEAVE NOW?

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:36.333
THIS HEARING
IS CLOSED.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.500
NOT TOO SHABBY, HUH?

01:27:40.583 --> 01:27:41.708
YEAH.

01:27:44.667 --> 01:27:46.000
CONGRATULATIONS.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.333
YOU DID
A WONDERFUL JOB.

01:27:48.834 --> 01:27:50.041
MOLLY?

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.959
I'LL BRING THE GIRLS
TO THE GAME.

01:27:54.208 --> 01:27:55.125
O.K.?

01:27:56.834 --> 01:27:58.834
MS. McGRATH?

01:27:58.834 --> 01:28:00.041
GOOD LUCK TOMORROW.

01:28:01.542 --> 01:28:02.834
THANKS.

01:28:09.667 --> 01:28:11.166
[WHISTLE BLOWS]

01:28:17.834 --> 01:28:19.333
I LOOKED ALL OVER
FOR YOU GUYS.

01:28:20.917 --> 01:28:22.542

01:28:54.667 --> 01:28:56.417
HA HA HA HA!

01:28:56.417 --> 01:28:57.375
I'M A FUNNY GUY.

AW, COME ON!

01:30:09.458 --> 01:30:10.583
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
GET UP.

01:30:11.625 --> 01:30:13.000
PEANUT?

01:30:15.125 --> 01:30:16.792
THE KIDS GET HURT
'CAUSE THEY'RE TRAINED
FOR GIRLS' TRACK,

01:30:16.792 --> 01:30:18.834
NOT FOOTBALL.

01:30:18.834 --> 01:30:20.500
EAT SHIT AND DIE!

01:30:21.417 --> 01:30:22.625
HA HA HA!

01:30:22.625 --> 01:30:24.041
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

01:30:24.041 --> 01:30:25.875
IF I DON'T HAVE TO MOVE.

01:31:12.917 --> 01:31:14.625
WE'RE TWO TDs BEHIND.

01:31:14.625 --> 01:31:15.834
WE CAN GET THEM BACK.

01:31:17.041 --> 01:31:20.375
BIRD, TRUMAINE WAS OPEN.

01:31:20.375 --> 01:31:22.667
I COULDN'T SEE HIM
FROM UNDER THE PILE.

01:31:22.667 --> 01:31:25.000
YOU SAYIN' SOMETHING
ABOUT MY BLOCKING?

01:31:26.041 --> 01:31:27.208
THAT WHAT YOU CALL IT?

01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:30.792
AW, SHUT UP.

01:31:30.792 --> 01:31:32.375
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

01:31:32.375 --> 01:31:34.375
THEY'RE CHAMPIONS,
AND WE'RE DILDOS.

01:31:37.917 --> 01:31:39.041
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO? QUIT?

01:31:39.041 --> 01:31:40.375
WHY NOT?

01:31:40.875 --> 01:31:42.208
IT WORKED
FOR YOU.

01:31:43.375 --> 01:31:45.417
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:47.750
YOU DIDN'T
EXECUTE MY PLAYS.

01:31:52.333 --> 01:31:54.375
OH, I SEE.
THIS IS ABOUT YESTERDAY.

01:31:57.417 --> 01:31:58.208
GREAT.

01:32:00.959 --> 01:32:02.375
I SUPPOSE YOU THINK
I WAS CHICKENSHIT

01:32:02.375 --> 01:32:03.750
FOR WHAT I DID
IN COURT, HUH?

01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:10.583
YOU THINK I GOT BEAT

01:32:10.583 --> 01:32:11.917
BECAUSE I WAS
AFRAID TO FIGHT.

01:32:18.583 --> 01:32:19.917
YEAH, YOU DO.

01:32:21.875 --> 01:32:23.583
YOU FIGURE IF YOUR COACH
IS SUCH A LOSER,

01:32:23.583 --> 01:32:25.750
THEN YOU CAN BE, TOO.

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:26.750
DOESN'T IT?

01:32:43.208 --> 01:32:45.083
HEY, COACH.

01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:46.291
COACH, WHERE YOU GOIN'?

01:33:10.333 --> 01:33:12.000
FRANK!

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.333
THE DEAL'S OFF.

01:33:15.041 --> 01:33:17.583
YOU'RE NOT SENDING OUR GIRLS
TO SOME STUPID SCHOOL,

01:33:17.583 --> 01:33:19.125
AND YOU'RE NOT
TAKING THEM AWAY FROM ME!

01:33:19.125 --> 01:33:20.208
YEAH!

01:33:22.792 --> 01:33:24.208
AND I'M NOT QUITTING
MY JOB HERE, EITHER.

01:33:29.291 --> 01:33:31.959
IF THAT'S NOT O.K.
WITH YOU, SUE ME,

01:33:31.959 --> 01:33:34.250
AND I'LL FIGHT YOU ALL THE WAY
TO THE SUPREME COURT.

01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:35.834
DON'T MAKE HER GIVE UP
THE KIDS, FRANK.

01:33:36.583 --> 01:33:38.291
YEAH, YOU WORM!

01:33:39.125 --> 01:33:40.417
STAY OUT OF THIS!

01:33:40.417 --> 01:33:44.500
FRANK, I DON'T WANT TO BE
A QUITTER ANYMORE.

01:33:45.708 --> 01:33:47.333
I DON'T WANT OUR GIRLS
TO SEE A QUITTER.

01:33:53.834 --> 01:33:55.041
FOR THEM...

01:33:56.208 --> 01:33:57.417
NOT FOR ME.

01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:03.583
O.K.

01:34:04.708 --> 01:34:06.375
WE'LL WORK IT OUT.

01:34:06.375 --> 01:34:07.375
WE'LL WORK IT OUT?

01:34:08.667 --> 01:34:09.750
WE'LL WORK IT OUT!

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.166
ONE MORE CONDITION.

01:34:17.166 --> 01:34:18.542
SECOND HALF,
YOU GOT TO CHEER.

01:34:18.542 --> 01:34:20.708
OH, GOD.
SUPREME COURT!

01:34:20.708 --> 01:34:24.208
O.K. YOU TAKE THEM

01:34:25.083 --> 01:34:26.542
COME ON, BENCH WARMERS!

01:34:26.542 --> 01:34:27.834

01:34:31.333 --> 01:34:32.333
HEY, LADY,

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:34.083
YEAH.

01:34:34.083 --> 01:34:35.625
TELL US
WHAT TO DO.

01:34:35.625 --> 01:34:36.708
WIN, YOU TURKEYS!

01:34:38.083 --> 01:34:39.208
HUT!

01:34:46.583 --> 01:34:47.583
ALL RIGHT!

01:34:54.834 --> 01:34:55.708
ALL RIGHT!
