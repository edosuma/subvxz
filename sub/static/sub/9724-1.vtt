WEBVTT

04:40.322 --> 04:43.314
- We're about ready to go here.
- Good.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.699
I'm looking for James.
Has anybody seen James Ballard?

04:46.745 --> 04:51.785
- You know-the producer of this epic.
- I think I saw him in the camera room.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.201
James?

04:57.422 --> 04:59.253
Are you in there?

05:00.801 --> 05:05.295
Could we please get your approval
on our steadicam shot?

05:09.476 --> 05:11.467
Of course.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.848
Be there in a minute.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.154
Where were you?

05:31.414 --> 05:33.871
In a private aircraft hangar.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.995
Anyone could have walked in.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.338
Did you come?

05:43.844 --> 05:45.675
No.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.557
What about your camera girl?

05:52.602 --> 05:55.093
Did she come?

06:09.619 --> 06:12.031
We were interrupted.

06:17.168 --> 06:20.285
I had to get back to the set.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.665
Poor darling.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.630
Maybe the next one.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.675
Maybe the next one.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.052
Shit.

08:49.738 --> 08:53.651
Not a lot of action here.

08:53.700 --> 08:57.443
They consider this
to be the airport hospital.

08:59.289 --> 09:03.248
This ward is reserved
for air crash victims.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.330
The beds are kept waiting.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.792
Well, if I ground up during
my flying lesson Saturday...

09:09.841 --> 09:12.298
You might find me next to you.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.636
You're getting out of bed soon.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.636
They want you to walk.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.267
The other man-the dead man-

09:30.320 --> 09:33.107
his wife's a doctor.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.397
Dr Helen Remington.

09:35.408 --> 09:40.573
She's here somewhere,
as a patient, of course.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.414
Maybe you'll find her in the hallway
during one of your walks.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.829
What was her husband?

09:50.840 --> 09:53.547
A chemical engineer for a food company.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.508
Where's the car?

10:01.309 --> 10:03.595
Outside, in the visitors car park.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.094
What?

10:07.565 --> 10:11.683
- They brought the car here?
- My car, not yours.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.559
Oh.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.355
Yours is a complete wreck.

10:17.408 --> 10:20.491
The police had to drag it to the pound.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.653
It's behind the station.

10:24.415 --> 10:28.624
After being bombarded endlessly
by road safety propaganda...

10:30.672 --> 10:34.039
I'm almost relieved to have...

10:34.092 --> 10:37.835
Found myself in an actual accident.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.951
Dr Remington.

11:32.775 --> 11:36.484
- James Ballard?
- Yes.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.384
- Crash victim?
- Yes.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.821
We'll deal with these later.

12:51.729 --> 12:55.438
Both of the front wheels of their car
and the engine...

12:55.525 --> 12:58.437
Were driven back
into the driver's section.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.351
Oh, and the floor.

13:02.407 --> 13:06.491
Blood still marked the hood
like little streamers of black lace...

13:06.577 --> 13:10.786
Running toward
the windshield wiper cutters.

13:10.790 --> 13:15.750
Tiny flecks were spattered
across the seat and steering wheel...

13:18.840 --> 13:21.582
And the instrument panel was...

13:22.885 --> 13:24.671
Buckled inwards...

13:24.721 --> 13:28.805
Cracking the clock and speedometer dials.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.176
The cabin was deformed.

13:34.188 --> 13:37.772
There was dust, glass...

13:37.817 --> 13:41.435
Plastic flakes everywhere inside.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.604
The carpeting...

13:44.657 --> 13:47.023
Was damp.

13:47.076 --> 13:51.035
It stank of blood and other body
and machine fluids.

14:16.439 --> 14:19.181
I should've gone to the funeral.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.775
I wish I had.

14:24.155 --> 14:27.818
They bury the dead so quickly.

14:27.909 --> 14:31.117
They should leave them
lying around for months.

14:33.456 --> 14:37.290
What about his wife, the woman doctor?
Have you been to visit her yet?

14:42.507 --> 14:44.589
I couldn't.

14:47.970 --> 14:51.053
I feel too close to her.

15:22.839 --> 15:26.673
I don't like the idea
of you getting into a car so soon.

15:26.717 --> 15:32.178
I can't sit on this balcony forever.
I feel like a potted plant.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.840
How can you drive, James?

15:37.103 --> 15:39.264
You can barely walk.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.641
Is traffic heavier now?

15:46.362 --> 15:50.981
There seem to be three times as many
cars as there were before the accident.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.197
I have to leave for work.

18:34.780 --> 18:40.195
After this sort of thing how can people
even look at a car, let alone drive one?

18:48.210 --> 18:50.701
I'm trying to find Charles' car.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.331
It's not here.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.716
Maybe the police are still holding it.

18:57.762 --> 19:00.845
They said it was here this morning.

19:11.776 --> 19:14.017
This is your car?

19:30.503 --> 19:32.835
You might tear your glove.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.587
I never should have come here.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.599
I'm surprised the police
don't make it more difficult.

19:46.602 --> 19:50.766
Were you badly hurt?
We saw each other at the hospital.

19:50.773 --> 19:53.480
I don't want the car.

19:53.567 --> 19:57.776
In fact, I was appalled to find
I have to pay to have it scrapped.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.406
Can I give you a lift?

20:03.744 --> 20:06.827
I somehow find myself driving again.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.797
You haven't told me where we're going.

20:17.842 --> 20:20.128
I haven't?

20:20.177 --> 20:22.839
- To the airport, if you don't mind.
- The airport?

20:22.888 --> 20:26.722
- Why? Are you leaving?
- Not yet.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.644
Though not soon enough for some people.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.768
A death in the doctor's family
makes the patients uneasy.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.145
I take it you're not wearing white
to reassure them.

20:37.194 --> 20:41.278
I'll wear a fucking kimono if I want to.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.910
So, why the airport?

20:52.001 --> 20:56.586
I work in the immigration department.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.706
- Do you want a cigarette?
- No.

21:02.678 --> 21:06.011
I started to smoke at the hospital.

21:06.056 --> 21:09.389
Kind of stupid.

21:17.860 --> 21:20.442
All this traffic-

21:24.074 --> 21:27.908
- I'm not sure I can deal with it.
- It's much worse now. Have you noticed?

21:27.953 --> 21:29.818
Yes.

21:37.004 --> 21:40.622
The day I left the hospital...

21:40.674 --> 21:44.542
I had the extraordinary feeling
that all these cars...

21:44.553 --> 21:48.341
Were gathering for some special reason
I didn't understand.

21:50.476 --> 21:54.765
There seemed to be
ten times as much traffic.

21:59.902 --> 22:01.733
Are we imagining it?

22:07.868 --> 22:12.077
You've bought yourself
exactly the same car again.

22:12.122 --> 22:16.206
It's the same shape and colour.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.976
We're close to the airport garage.

22:42.987 --> 22:46.070
It won't be busy this time of day.

25:22.396 --> 25:25.479
"Don't worry.
That guy's gotta see us."

25:28.986 --> 25:32.069
"Don't worry.
That guy's gotta see us."

25:36.201 --> 25:40.695
These were the confident last words of
the brilliant, young Hollywood star...

25:40.706 --> 25:43.493
James Dean...

25:43.542 --> 25:47.831
As he piloted his Porsche
550 spyder race car...

25:47.880 --> 25:50.667
Toward a date with death...

25:50.716 --> 25:55.710
Along a lonely stretch
of a California two-Lane blacktop-

25:55.763 --> 25:58.846
route 466.

26:01.810 --> 26:05.928
"Don't worry. That guy's gotta see us."

26:12.196 --> 26:15.814
The year: 1955.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.783
The day: September 30.

26:21.622 --> 26:26.332
The time: Now.

26:29.963 --> 26:32.921
The first star of our show...

26:32.925 --> 26:35.291
Is little bastard...

26:35.302 --> 26:38.715
James Dean's racing Porsche.

26:38.806 --> 26:43.049
He named it after himself
and had his racing number 130...

26:43.060 --> 26:45.267
Painted on it.

26:46.563 --> 26:49.680
Who is that, the announcer?
Do I know him?

26:54.029 --> 26:56.361
That's Vaughan.

26:56.406 --> 27:00.024
He spoke to you at the hospital.

27:01.787 --> 27:05.450
I thought he was
a medical photographer...

27:06.834 --> 27:09.325
Doing some sort
of accident research.

27:09.378 --> 27:13.041
He wanted every conceivable detail
about our crash.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.879
When I first met Vaughan
he was a specialist...

27:20.931 --> 27:24.014
In international
computerized traffic systems.

27:27.604 --> 27:30.471
I don't know what he is now.

27:30.524 --> 27:33.641
Which brings us to the second star.

27:33.694 --> 27:37.312
The stuntman and former
race driver Colin Seagrave.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.901
Colin Seagrave!

27:39.950 --> 27:43.693
He will drive our replica
of James Dean's car.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.748
You up for this?

27:51.044 --> 27:53.160
You bet.

27:53.172 --> 27:58.633
I myself shall play the role of James
Dean's racing mechanic Rolf witherich...

27:58.677 --> 28:02.215
Sent over from the Porsche factory
in Germany.

28:02.264 --> 28:06.633
This mechanic was himself fated to die
in a car crash in Germany...

28:06.643 --> 28:10.056
26 years later.

28:10.105 --> 28:13.268
The third, and in some ways...

28:13.317 --> 28:16.775
Most important player-

28:16.820 --> 28:20.984
the college student, Donald turnupseed...

28:20.991 --> 28:23.824
Played by movie stuntman Brett trask.

28:33.712 --> 28:38.706
Turnupseed was on his way back home
to Fresno for the weekend.

28:38.759 --> 28:42.297
James Dean was on his way
to an automobile race in salinas.

28:43.764 --> 28:48.258
Salinas was just a dusty town
in northern California.

28:48.310 --> 28:52.349
The two would meet for one moment...

28:52.397 --> 28:56.857
But it was a moment...

28:56.902 --> 28:59.314
That would create a Hollywood legend.

29:01.448 --> 29:06.158
You'll notice that we're not wearing
helmets or safety padding of any kind.

29:06.203 --> 29:09.866
Our cars are not equipped
with roll cages or seat belts.

29:09.957 --> 29:14.621
We rely solely on the skill
of our drivers for our safety...

29:14.711 --> 29:19.125
So that we can bring you
the ultimate in authenticity.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.376
All right.

29:23.470 --> 29:27.088
Here we go.
The fatal crash of James Dean.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.645
Okay, let's wind it up.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.742
Go.

30:53.935 --> 30:56.472
Is this part of the act,
or are they really hurt?

30:56.521 --> 31:00.184
I don't know.
You can never be sure with Vaughan.

31:01.651 --> 31:04.017
This is his show.

31:07.115 --> 31:09.857
Rolf wiitherich...

31:09.910 --> 31:12.401
Was thrown from the Porsche...

31:13.872 --> 31:16.158
And spent a year...

31:17.376 --> 31:19.867
In the hospital...

31:22.464 --> 31:24.876
Recovering from his injuries.

31:34.351 --> 31:38.640
Donald turnupseed was found
wandering around in a daze...

31:38.688 --> 31:41.930
But basically unhurt.

31:41.983 --> 31:46.943
James Dean died of a broken neck
and became immortal.

31:54.329 --> 31:57.196
What's the matter?

31:57.249 --> 32:00.867
Help me up. I'm dizzy. I can't stand.

32:00.961 --> 32:03.577
I know that man Seagrave.

32:03.630 --> 32:06.713
I think he's genuinely hurt.

32:22.816 --> 32:26.434
You're all liable
for fines and possible arrest.

32:26.528 --> 32:29.941
Disperse at once.
Disperse at once.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.949
- How you doin'?
- I'm all right.

32:37.998 --> 32:41.536
- What's the matter with Seagrave?
- He hit his head, I think.

32:41.626 --> 32:44.083
His balance is off.

32:47.299 --> 32:50.507
Why are the police
taking this so seriously?

32:50.510 --> 32:55.300
It's not the police,
it's the department of transport.

32:55.307 --> 33:00.176
It's a big joke.
They have no idea who we really are.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.149
Was I glib?

33:17.496 --> 33:21.159
"James Dean died of a broken neck
and became immortal."

33:26.755 --> 33:29.167
I couldn't resist.

34:09.214 --> 34:11.125
Oh, god.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.039
What happened?

34:13.092 --> 34:16.335
Here. Lie down.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.962
They did the James Dean crash.

34:19.056 --> 34:24.222
It seemed to go perfectly, but then
he was feeling nauseous on the way back.

34:24.271 --> 34:26.226
I'm sure it's concussion.

34:26.273 --> 34:29.686
We're familiar enough with that,
aren't we?

35:15.780 --> 35:18.613
Seagrave.

35:22.662 --> 35:26.200
Seagrave, I really would like...

35:26.207 --> 35:29.074
To work out the details...

35:29.127 --> 35:32.745
Of the jayne Mansfield crash with you.

35:44.225 --> 35:47.843
We could do the decapitation.

35:49.314 --> 35:52.397
The head embedded
in the windshield.

35:55.862 --> 35:58.444
And the dead dog thing,
you know.

36:03.078 --> 36:06.195
You know, the chihuahua
in the back seat.

36:06.247 --> 36:08.659
I got it all worked out.

36:12.796 --> 36:15.082
I'll be ready, Vaughan.

36:16.049 --> 36:18.540
I want really big tits.

36:20.136 --> 36:22.172
Out to here.

36:23.890 --> 36:28.475
So the audience can see 'em get
all cut up and crushed on the dashboard.

36:32.982 --> 36:35.064
Yeah, we'll do that.

36:35.151 --> 36:39.190
Ballard, I need your help.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.463
Do you live here with Seagrave?

37:06.516 --> 37:10.179
No, I live in my car.
This is my workshop.

37:29.539 --> 37:31.951
This is my new project.

37:53.646 --> 37:56.729
You recognize her?

37:56.775 --> 37:59.187
That's Gabrielle.

38:00.653 --> 38:03.565
She's right outside the door there.

38:50.870 --> 38:53.612
I thought
you might be missing these.

39:04.676 --> 39:07.759
Here you are,
at the nerve centre.

39:12.559 --> 39:16.268
Vaughan makes everything
look like a crime, doesn't he?

39:35.874 --> 39:39.116
What exactly is your project, Vaughan?

39:40.128 --> 39:43.495
A book of car crashes?

39:46.092 --> 39:48.174
A medical study?

39:48.970 --> 39:51.461
A sensational documentary?

39:54.517 --> 39:56.428
Global traffic?

39:57.937 --> 40:00.428
It's something...

40:00.523 --> 40:04.732
We are all intimately involved in.

40:06.946 --> 40:11.315
The reshaping of the human body
by modern technology.

43:33.236 --> 43:38.230
He must have fucked a lot of women
in that huge car of his.

43:38.241 --> 43:40.823
It's like a bed on wheels.

43:42.662 --> 43:45.404
It must smell of semen.

43:47.959 --> 43:50.245
It does.

43:54.340 --> 43:57.082
Do you find him attractive?

43:57.135 --> 43:59.626
He's very pale.

44:01.556 --> 44:03.922
Covered with scars.

44:03.975 --> 44:08.309
Would you like to fuck him,
though, in that car?

44:10.064 --> 44:12.555
No.

44:15.570 --> 44:18.812
But when he's in that car, he-

44:21.242 --> 44:23.699
have you seen his penis?

44:28.124 --> 44:30.615
Looks like it's badly scarred...

44:33.880 --> 44:36.292
From a motorcycle accident.

44:40.511 --> 44:42.923
Is he circumcised?

44:44.348 --> 44:47.431
Can you imagine
what his anus looks like?

44:47.476 --> 44:49.888
Describe it to me.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.937
Would you like to sodomize him?

45:00.239 --> 45:03.402
Would you like to put your penis
right into his anus?

45:03.492 --> 45:06.234
Just thrust it up his anus?

45:06.287 --> 45:11.372
Tell me. Describe it to me.

45:11.417 --> 45:14.033
Tell me what you would do.

45:14.086 --> 45:18.420
How could you just kiss him
in that car?

45:20.134 --> 45:23.342
Describe how you'd reach over...

45:24.555 --> 45:27.171
And unzip his greasy jeans...

45:27.225 --> 45:29.637
Take out his penis.

45:32.688 --> 45:36.397
Would you kiss it or suck it right away?

45:39.278 --> 45:42.111
Which hand would you hold it in?

45:46.369 --> 45:48.826
Have you ever sucked a penis?

45:51.290 --> 45:54.578
Do you known what semen tastes like?

45:55.795 --> 45:58.286
Have you ever tasted semen?

45:59.799 --> 46:03.041
Some semen is saltier than others.

46:14.021 --> 46:18.390
Vaughan's semen must be very salty.

46:57.189 --> 46:59.601
Have you come?

47:02.194 --> 47:04.651
I'm all right.

47:25.009 --> 47:27.421
Finish your story.

47:29.722 --> 47:35.012
The junior pathologist
at ashford hospital.

47:35.102 --> 47:38.845
Then the husband of a colleague of mine.

47:40.816 --> 47:43.023
Then...

47:44.779 --> 47:47.646
A trainee radiologist.

47:47.698 --> 47:51.441
Then the service manager at my garage.

47:54.121 --> 47:57.409
You had sex with all those men in cars?

47:57.458 --> 48:00.370
Only in cars?

48:00.378 --> 48:02.869
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.

48:07.134 --> 48:12.379
Did you fantasize that Vaughan
was photographing all these sex acts...

48:12.431 --> 48:15.138
As though they were
traffic accidents?

48:15.184 --> 48:17.015
Yes.

48:19.313 --> 48:23.723
They felt like traffic accidents.

49:19.957 --> 49:24.200
We must accumulate
all the paper we can, Ballard.

49:24.253 --> 49:27.290
Some of the stuff
that Helen brought back is terrific.

49:27.381 --> 49:30.919
Tolerances of the human face
in crash impacts.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.549
Mechanisms of-

49:36.891 --> 49:39.507
where is the-

49:39.560 --> 49:45.897
I'm sure we see this again
in slow motion-closer, I mean.

49:45.941 --> 49:48.603
In detail.

49:48.652 --> 49:51.735
We can watch another tape.

49:51.780 --> 49:54.772
No. I know this tape.

49:54.825 --> 49:57.111
That tape player's fucked.

49:57.119 --> 50:00.486
That's what it is.
It always does that.

50:00.539 --> 50:02.621
It always does that.

50:25.898 --> 50:27.934
You're upset.

50:29.652 --> 50:32.735
I'm all right.

50:32.780 --> 50:35.522
I'm all right now.

50:54.134 --> 50:57.968
I've always wanted to drive a crash car.

50:59.682 --> 51:02.719
You could get your wish at any moment.

51:02.810 --> 51:05.893
I mean a crash car with a history.

51:05.938 --> 51:08.429
Camus' vega...

51:08.440 --> 51:11.022
Nathaniel west's station wagon...

51:11.068 --> 51:14.026
Grace Kelly's rover 3500.

51:14.113 --> 51:17.526
Just fix it enough to get it rolling.

51:17.575 --> 51:21.238
Don't clean it.
Don't touch anything else.

51:26.625 --> 51:29.617
Is that why you drive this car?

51:31.547 --> 51:36.211
Do you see Kennedy's assassination
as a special kind of car crash?

51:36.218 --> 51:38.504
The case could be made.

51:50.107 --> 51:53.144
Here. Take a look at this.

51:53.152 --> 51:56.940
Tell me what you think of these.

52:01.035 --> 52:04.573
Yeah, you recognize this one.
This is James Dean.

52:08.834 --> 52:13.453
This is the next one Seagrave and
I are gonna do-jayne Mansfield.

52:18.761 --> 52:21.127
It's all very satisfying.

52:21.138 --> 52:24.346
I'm not sure I understand why.

52:27.144 --> 52:29.385
That's the future, Ballard...

52:29.438 --> 52:33.022
And you're already apart of it.

52:33.067 --> 52:37.231
You're beginning to see that
for the first time...

52:37.279 --> 52:41.238
There's benevolent psychopathology
that beckons towards us.

52:42.743 --> 52:46.361
For example, the car crash
is a fertilizing...

52:46.455 --> 52:49.913
Rather than a destructive event...

52:50.000 --> 52:53.538
A liberation of sexual energy...

52:53.712 --> 52:57.830
Mediating the sexuality
of those who have died...

52:57.883 --> 53:01.967
With an intensity that's impossible
in any other form.

53:02.012 --> 53:06.597
To experience that,
to live that, that is-

53:08.060 --> 53:10.301
that's my project.

53:10.354 --> 53:14.814
What about the reshaping
of the human body by modern technology?

53:14.858 --> 53:17.645
I thought that was your project.

53:18.570 --> 53:21.437
That's just
a crude Sci-Fi concept.

53:21.490 --> 53:25.699
It kind of floats on the surface
and doesn't threaten anybody.

53:25.828 --> 53:30.993
I use it to test the resilience of my
potential partners in psychopathology.

53:55.858 --> 53:58.099
- What's going on, baby?
- What's going on with you?

53:58.110 --> 54:00.977
- You wanna go for a ride?
- You and your friend?

54:01.029 --> 54:03.941
- Just me and my friend here.
- All right, that's cool.

54:03.991 --> 54:06.607
- Don't go away.
- I'm not. What you got under there?

54:06.618 --> 54:09.075
- I'm clean.
- You got a place?

54:09.121 --> 54:11.703
Just right back there,
in the back seat of my car.

54:11.749 --> 54:14.240
- In your car?
- We'll drive. It'll be nice.

54:14.293 --> 54:17.205
- You're a good driver?
- Absolutely. Sixty dollars.

54:17.296 --> 54:20.754
- Sixty dollars?
- You'll get a nice, scenic ride.

54:20.799 --> 54:24.166
- One-fifty for the two.
- No, it's just me.

54:24.219 --> 54:26.835
- Just you?
- If he does get involved, 150.

54:26.889 --> 54:28.925
- Maybe.
- What do you mean?

54:28.974 --> 54:31.340
I'm saying, is he all right?

54:34.605 --> 54:37.096
Come here, sweetie.

54:37.149 --> 54:39.390
- Open your mouth.
- Yes, daddy.

54:40.736 --> 54:44.194
There you go. Don't want you
blowing it up my urethra.

54:46.408 --> 54:48.990
James, you drive.

56:52.159 --> 56:55.697
James, we're leaving now.
You want a lift?

56:56.914 --> 56:58.905
No, thank you.

56:59.917 --> 57:02.875
Catherine's coming to pick me up.

57:13.805 --> 57:16.091
What's going on?

57:16.099 --> 57:19.557
They've been questioning Vaughan
about an accident at the airport.

57:19.645 --> 57:21.977
A pedestrian was killed.

57:23.774 --> 57:26.891
They think he was run over intentionally.

57:26.985 --> 57:29.897
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.

57:32.449 --> 57:34.656
Don't you think he looks a bit shaky?

57:39.164 --> 57:41.780
- Maybe I should drive him.
- Where's your car?

57:41.833 --> 57:44.540
At home.
I couldn't face the traffic.

57:59.142 --> 58:01.178
Why don't I drive?

58:37.222 --> 58:39.178
You coming?

58:54.531 --> 58:56.647
That's it. Yeah.

59:00.787 --> 59:02.869
Yes.

59:02.914 --> 59:04.905
Let's record this.

59:15.218 --> 59:17.334
This is a work of art.

59:17.387 --> 59:19.628
Absolutely a work of art.

59:26.563 --> 59:29.020
Oh, yes, yes.

59:29.066 --> 59:31.102
Slow down. Not so fast.

59:41.411 --> 59:43.447
Slow down. Stop.

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:14.871
You couldn't wait for me?

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:18.124
You did the jayne Mansfield crash
without me?

01:03:18.169 --> 01:03:21.161
Oh, the dog.
The dog is brilliant.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:39.137
I must have driven through something.

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:44.017
There's some blood on the car.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:47.437
Here on the handle,
and on the wheel.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.823
Also on the wheel well.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:52.783
See?

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:56.950
If the police stop you again,
they may impound the car.

01:03:56.958 --> 01:04:00.075
You're right, Ballard.
You're right.

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:05.793
There's an all-night car wash
by the airport service area.

01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:09.380
Watch yourself.

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:26.297
Is there something here
that interests you?

01:12:28.886 --> 01:12:30.842
This interests me.

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:38.100
I'd like to see if I can fit into a car
designed for a normal body.

01:12:38.145 --> 01:12:40.227
Could you help me into it, please?

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:45.270
Yeah, sure.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.613
Are these safe cars?

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:57.236
Yes, of course.
They're very safe.

01:13:23.316 --> 01:13:25.272
I'm caught.

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:01.884
Oh, shit.

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:07.981
Fuck! This is bad.
This is really bad.

01:16:40.679 --> 01:16:43.762
James, somebody named Vaughan.
You want it?

01:16:47.228 --> 01:16:49.059
Hello. Ballard.

01:16:49.814 --> 01:16:53.898
I need to see you.
I need to talk about the project.

01:16:57.404 --> 01:16:59.144
Where are you?

01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:15.748
I think you're making it too clean.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:18.380
Medical tattoos are supposed to be clean.

01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:22.593
This is not a medical tattoo.
This is a prophetic tattoo.

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:25.971
And prophesies are ragged and dirty.

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:30.973
So, make it ragged and dirty.

01:17:31.021 --> 01:17:36.106
Prophetic? Is this personal prophecy
or global prophecy?

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:39.519
There's no difference.

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:43.489
Let me see here. Where is it?

01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:46.950
There it is.

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:51.660
I want you to let her give you this one.

01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:02.337
Where do you think that one should go?

01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:28.993
I thought that was you up there.

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:35.291
My last lesson's next week.

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:55.519
James, my car is-

01:24:00.577 --> 01:24:02.192
What?

01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:07.497
Could it have been deliberate?

01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:10.785
One of your suitors.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.897
It was Vaughan.

01:24:49.209 --> 01:24:51.746
The traffic.

01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:54.707
Where is everyone?

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.747
They've all gone away.

01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:04.012
I'd like to go back.

01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:54.628
I'd like to register a claim
for the 1963 black Lincoln.

01:29:54.681 --> 01:29:58.265
Is there a form I should fill out?

01:29:58.310 --> 01:30:01.518
I can give you the forms now,
but you'll have to come back...

01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:05.727
Between 7:30 and 4:30 to register a claim.

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:08.146
What's your attachment to that thing?

01:30:09.905 --> 01:30:11.987
A close friend owned it.

01:30:12.032 --> 01:30:17.072
It's gotta be a total write-off. I don't
see what you could possibly do with it.

01:33:49.207 --> 01:33:51.243
Are you all right?

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:04.552
I don't know.

01:34:06.015 --> 01:34:08.006
Are you hurt?

01:34:11.688 --> 01:34:13.724
I think I'm all right.

01:34:22.699 --> 01:34:24.690
I think I'm all right.

01:34:44.304 --> 01:34:46.545
Maybe the next one, darling.

01:34:57.775 --> 01:34:59.982
Maybe the next one.
