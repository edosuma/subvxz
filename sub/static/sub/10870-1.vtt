WEBVTT

01:31.683 --> 01:33.392
It's Milton Bradley.

01:33.517 --> 01:35.017
Okay, thanks.

01:46.850 --> 01:48.166
This stuff sucks.

01:48.266 --> 01:50.225
All right, kid,

01:50.350 --> 01:52.891
you want to see top-shelf quality?

01:53.016 --> 01:55.583
I'm gonna show you
my own personal line, okay?

01:55.683 --> 01:58.183
This is between you and me.
I'm still in the copyrighting stage.

01:58.308 --> 02:01.725
What I'm about to show you
is for your eyes only.

02:03.766 --> 02:06.558
Doghouse series. This is Doghouse Reilly.

02:06.683 --> 02:09.916
Age, unknown. Eye color, cobalt.

02:10.015 --> 02:14.183
Hair, forest gold.
Build, smoker's athletic.

02:14.308 --> 02:18.083
Occupation, trillionaire detective.

02:18.183 --> 02:19.183
Sounds lame.

02:19.308 --> 02:21.558
You're lame, kid.

02:21.683 --> 02:24.625
Doghouse would punch out
your whole family for that remark.

02:24.725 --> 02:26.891
Is that cat for sale?

02:31.183 --> 02:32.791
Is that a real question?

02:32.891 --> 02:34.916
He's on the table.

02:35.016 --> 02:37.891
So is your hand. Are you for sale?

02:38.016 --> 02:42.308
No, you're not, so please remove it
and yourself from my lawn.

02:42.683 --> 02:44.183
- Loser.
- Doll-kisser.

02:46.100 --> 02:49.391
Clinton, what did you say to that boy?

02:50.391 --> 02:52.016
Just a business disagreement.

02:52.141 --> 02:55.125
Ma... Ma, we're gonna be late.

02:55.225 --> 02:57.666
You're seeing this, right?

02:57.766 --> 03:00.083
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

03:00.183 --> 03:02.225
This is not normal.
He's not himself anymore.

03:02.350 --> 03:05.058
He's sleeping all the time.
He's eating less.

03:05.183 --> 03:07.250
He just stares blankly off into space.

03:07.350 --> 03:10.725
He's been disappearing for days at a time.

03:10.850 --> 03:13.558
And look at his hair.
Something's wrong with his hair.

03:13.683 --> 03:14.891
It looks like it's falling out.

03:15.016 --> 03:18.516
I think for a 17-year-old cat,
he appears quite healthy.

03:18.641 --> 03:20.458
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

03:20.558 --> 03:21.975
Just...

03:24.141 --> 03:27.291
The truth is, doc,
things haven't been so good lately.

03:27.391 --> 03:30.000
Nothing makes him happy anymore.

03:30.100 --> 03:32.891
It's like his will and spirit are gone.

03:33.016 --> 03:35.000
- You know I'm a veterinarian?
- Right.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.600
I think you should consult a psychiatrist.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.850
They have those for cats now?

03:41.975 --> 03:44.583
Okay, Ma, we've got to make an appointment

03:44.683 --> 03:47.141
with Dr. Sloane in Petaluma.

03:48.183 --> 03:50.666
This is why you've got
to get your license, hon.

03:50.766 --> 03:53.058
I'm talking about Mouser's well-being,

03:53.183 --> 03:56.083
and you're bugging me
about a driver's license.

03:56.183 --> 03:58.625
It's unbelievable, Ma.

03:58.725 --> 04:01.125
- What are you doing?
- I need a few things.

04:01.225 --> 04:03.750
We're just gonna stop
at Ford's Megastore for a minute.

04:03.850 --> 04:06.583
You know very well
it's against everything I stand for.

04:06.683 --> 04:09.583
Not this time. I really don't care.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.625
He killed my business, Ma.

04:11.725 --> 04:13.750
Now I'm stuck running a yard sale
like a common clown.

04:13.850 --> 04:16.333
You had a corner comics store
that lasted, what, six months?

04:16.433 --> 04:18.683
You didn't even make a cent.

04:18.808 --> 04:21.683
What does Ford's Megastore
have to do with anything?

04:21.808 --> 04:24.933
This coming from my number-one investor.

04:27.516 --> 04:29.891
You've changed, Ma.

04:31.808 --> 04:35.975
I said that you were... okay.

04:41.933 --> 04:45.791
Hey, honey, I'm off.

04:45.891 --> 04:49.083
Uh, mac and cheese is in the fridge.

04:49.183 --> 04:50.891
Okay, thanks, Mom.

04:53.058 --> 04:54.791
Do you smell gasoline?

04:54.891 --> 04:57.000
That's perfume, Clinton.

04:57.100 --> 05:01.350
What's that? Lipstick?
You're not going on a date, are you?

05:01.475 --> 05:02.916
What, I can't dress up?

05:03.016 --> 05:05.166
Not that it's any of your business.

05:05.266 --> 05:08.725
I'm just trying to protect you from
the douchebags you seem to attract.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.625
- "The douchebags"?
- Scumbags, dirtbags...

05:11.725 --> 05:13.000
all the bags.

05:13.100 --> 05:15.516
As you know,
I haven't had a date in years.

05:17.641 --> 05:18.958
That's hilarious.

05:19.058 --> 05:20.183
What...

05:21.183 --> 05:23.683
What? No, not you, Mom, the show.

05:23.808 --> 05:26.766
I was laughing at the show. Tony Danza.

05:29.516 --> 05:30.958
Hi, everybody. I'm Al Ford.

05:31.058 --> 05:33.558
Come on down to the Megastore,
where you steal from us!

05:33.683 --> 05:36.016
Home barbecues... we're on fire.

05:36.141 --> 05:39.083
Sporting goods... you betcha.

05:39.183 --> 05:42.749
Toys for kids? Dude!

05:42.849 --> 05:44.724
So come on down
to Ford's Megastore, where...

05:44.849 --> 05:47.058
You steal from us!

05:53.141 --> 05:54.266
Hey, buddy.

05:55.266 --> 05:57.141
Can you believe that asshole?

05:58.683 --> 06:01.499
What are you doing? Hey, buddy.

06:01.599 --> 06:04.833
What are you doing?

06:04.933 --> 06:06.891
What are you always doing up here, huh?

06:07.683 --> 06:09.599
Come here.

06:12.599 --> 06:14.166
Come on.

06:14.266 --> 06:16.833
What's going on with you, huh?

06:16.933 --> 06:19.666
I'm worried about you.

06:19.766 --> 06:22.516
Mundhra says you need a shrink.

06:28.599 --> 06:30.058
Hey, buddy.

07:04.183 --> 07:05.766
Mouser?

07:30.016 --> 07:31.641
What the hell?

07:37.308 --> 07:39.349
Oh, are you kidding me?

07:41.474 --> 07:45.224
Come on. Ah. Ma?

07:45.349 --> 07:47.791
Ma, what happened?

07:47.891 --> 07:49.891
I'm so sorry, honey.

07:52.266 --> 07:53.724
Ma...

07:58.141 --> 08:00.766
What's going on? Hey, hey, hey.

08:02.016 --> 08:04.016
Mouser?

08:04.141 --> 08:06.099
Mouser! What... what happened?

08:11.099 --> 08:13.058
What happened? What happened?

08:14.016 --> 08:16.016
Did anyone see what happened?

08:17.349 --> 08:19.791
Wait, no... no one saw anything?

08:19.891 --> 08:21.791
Just step back! Step back!

08:21.891 --> 08:23.849
Give him room to breathe.

08:25.183 --> 08:27.833
Oh, no, Mom!

08:27.933 --> 08:30.891
Ma... Mom, what...

08:32.015 --> 08:33.140
Mouser.

08:34.683 --> 08:36.183
Mouser, boy.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.666
...been here all night. I can't tell...

08:53.766 --> 08:55.749
I can't believe none of these people
called you guys sooner,

08:55.849 --> 08:58.349
not to mention,
you could've arrived here sooner,

08:58.474 --> 09:00.624
but you should probably question
some of these neighbors.

09:00.724 --> 09:03.182
I think when Molly
at dispatch got the call,

09:03.307 --> 09:06.891
there was at first an assumption
that it was a crank call.

09:07.016 --> 09:09.349
Sir, why don't we step over here?

09:12.724 --> 09:14.791
Can you tell me about last night?

09:14.891 --> 09:17.666
What did you do, what did you see?

09:17.766 --> 09:20.666
Uh, yeah, yeah. Um, I...

09:20.766 --> 09:23.791
I watched four episodes
of "Who's the Boss?"

09:23.891 --> 09:26.182
No, five, ac... five.

09:26.307 --> 09:29.624
Uh, I ate dinner,
macaroni and cheese, Kraft.

09:29.724 --> 09:31.391
Um...

09:31.516 --> 09:34.724
Did you see or hear anything?

09:36.641 --> 09:38.332
No, no.

09:38.432 --> 09:41.557
Any enemies that you know of
or recent threats of any kind?

09:41.682 --> 09:44.682
No, no. Mouser was very well-liked.

09:46.974 --> 09:48.182
I meant you.

09:49.474 --> 09:52.182
Oh. Um, no. None whatsoever.

09:53.724 --> 09:54.766
Okay.

09:56.224 --> 09:57.999
Thank you.

09:58.099 --> 10:00.057
W... what... what, that's it?

10:00.182 --> 10:03.682
Well, I'll file a report,
and we'll hope for the best.

10:03.807 --> 10:05.182
"Hope for the best"?

10:05.307 --> 10:08.916
There's an arrow sticking out of my cat!

10:09.016 --> 10:09.999
I'm sorry, sir.

10:10.099 --> 10:12.849
Aren't you going to take
some crime-scene photos?

10:12.974 --> 10:16.516
Take some DNA samples?
Where... where's are the lab guys?

10:16.641 --> 10:18.332
All right, let's just take it easy, bud.

10:18.432 --> 10:20.182
My cat was clearly murdered,

10:20.307 --> 10:23.766
So, no, I will not "take it easy, bud"!

10:27.766 --> 10:30.349
You... Mom, wha...

10:32.057 --> 10:33.682
- What the... hey, get the...
- Excuse me, sir.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.957
Can we have a few words with you?

10:36.057 --> 10:39.016
We're with the local news.
Is there something you'd like to say?

10:40.682 --> 10:42.624
Um...

10:42.724 --> 10:44.516
yes, yes, yes, yes.

10:44.641 --> 10:47.291
My best friend was murdered today,

10:47.391 --> 10:50.224
and I demand justice!

10:51.432 --> 10:52.682
End quote.

11:37.849 --> 11:39.724
Clinton?

11:43.474 --> 11:45.141
Clinton?

11:50.766 --> 11:52.224
Clinton?

11:55.682 --> 11:57.182
Not again.

11:59.224 --> 12:01.849
Clinton, will you please
come down from there?

12:01.974 --> 12:03.457
I'm having a vigil.

12:03.557 --> 12:06.916
- A vigil.
- Yes. A candlelight vigil.

12:07.016 --> 12:08.916
Couldn't you have it inside?

12:09.016 --> 12:12.016
Or maybe just at a safer height?

12:14.182 --> 12:16.432
Side socket by the window, please.

12:24.974 --> 12:27.265
Okay, will you come down now?

12:27.974 --> 12:29.432
Clinton!

12:50.307 --> 12:52.099
Shut that shit off!

13:08.349 --> 13:11.265
Oh, did you sleep on the roof again?

13:19.349 --> 13:22.057
- What is that?
- Oh, it's nothing.

13:22.182 --> 13:24.665
Well, why are you hiding it?

13:24.765 --> 13:27.557
I'm not. It's nothing.
I just haven't finished reading it yet.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.515
Let me see it. Ma?

13:29.640 --> 13:31.749
- Honey!
- Let me have it! I saw my face!

13:31.849 --> 13:34.140
Oh, for heaven's sake.

13:37.515 --> 13:41.182
They called me "a harmless oddball"?

13:41.307 --> 13:43.582
Honey, I think that it was
meant to be endearing.

13:43.682 --> 13:47.749
They say Mouser was last seen
when I was "staging a garage sale"?

13:47.849 --> 13:49.749
I wasn't staging anything.

13:49.849 --> 13:51.957
It was an actual goddamn garage sale!

13:52.057 --> 13:54.624
And he wasn't "found dead,"
he was murdered!

13:54.724 --> 13:57.582
This is bullshit! Nobody cares!

13:57.682 --> 13:59.182
Well, Frank cares.

14:00.265 --> 14:01.915
Who the hell is Frank?

14:02.015 --> 14:03.015
Sheriff Hoyle.

14:13.682 --> 14:14.890
Oh, come on.

14:20.182 --> 14:22.057
Store's closed indefinitely, kid.

14:22.182 --> 14:24.057
I got other business to attend to.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.124
What do you want, kid?

14:27.224 --> 14:30.015
Your cat? I saw him.

14:36.599 --> 14:37.849
What do you know?

14:37.974 --> 14:40.015
20.

14:40.140 --> 14:43.332
20? 20... 20 what? What... what... 20?

14:43.432 --> 14:45.557
- What is this 20?
- Bucks.

14:45.682 --> 14:48.849
Oh, come... I'm not giving you
20 bucks, you little weasel.

14:49.849 --> 14:52.057
Hey! Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Okay.

14:54.224 --> 14:56.790
I got... $10.36.

14:56.890 --> 14:58.890
Okay, now you want it.

14:59.015 --> 15:00.349
Follow me.

15:07.099 --> 15:08.682
Hey.

15:11.432 --> 15:13.349
Trevor, God damn it!

15:25.099 --> 15:26.290
Here.

15:26.390 --> 15:27.957
Here.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.999
"Here" what?

15:30.099 --> 15:32.332
I saw him.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.015
Dragging himself with the arrow
sticking out of him and all.

15:45.890 --> 15:48.015
Why didn't you help him?

15:48.140 --> 15:50.082
I didn't know what to do.

15:50.182 --> 15:52.182
You don't see that every day...

15:52.307 --> 15:54.848
a cat with an arrow out of it.

15:57.848 --> 15:59.998
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

16:00.098 --> 16:02.223
I've got to go to
the pool with my brother.

16:02.348 --> 16:05.723
Yeah, you... you go synchronize swim

16:05.848 --> 16:07.598
while I solve a murder!

17:04.473 --> 17:06.082
What the... Mouser.

17:06.182 --> 17:07.432
Mouser.

17:09.307 --> 17:13.223
"I answer to Horatio"? What the...

17:13.348 --> 17:15.498
"172 Hope's Crest."

17:15.598 --> 17:17.223
Hope's Crest? Hope's Crest?

17:46.890 --> 17:48.057
Hello?

17:50.140 --> 17:51.890
Hello?

17:52.015 --> 17:53.848
Hello?

17:55.307 --> 17:56.890
Hello?

18:40.432 --> 18:41.890
Mouser.

19:32.181 --> 19:33.973
Horatio?

19:37.890 --> 19:39.181
Hor... Horatio?

19:44.598 --> 19:46.623
Holy hell! Oh, my God!

19:46.723 --> 19:48.890
What the hell were you
doing in my closet, you pervert?

19:49.015 --> 19:50.390
Were you jerking off in there?

19:50.515 --> 19:52.665
No, no! Good God, no!

19:52.765 --> 19:54.556
- I'm calling the police.
- Wait.

19:54.681 --> 19:57.223
Don't move.
I will whack your balls with my flute.

19:57.348 --> 20:00.956
Jeez, no! I didn't break in, okay?
The door was open.

20:01.056 --> 20:03.331
So you just pranced right in, you freak?

20:03.431 --> 20:04.831
- I am not some kind...
- Hey, hey!

20:04.931 --> 20:06.956
Aah! Aah!

20:07.056 --> 20:09.331
What is that?
Is that my... is that my flyer?

20:09.431 --> 20:11.081
Yes! Yes!

20:11.181 --> 20:13.456
And I want to know why
there's a picture of my cat on it,

20:13.556 --> 20:16.723
not to mention all over your walls!

20:16.848 --> 20:20.456
- What?
- You sick... no, just skip it.

20:20.556 --> 20:22.665
Skip it. I know what you did.

20:22.765 --> 20:25.848
Why don't you put some clothes on,
'cause I'm calling the police?

20:25.973 --> 20:28.890
- I'm calling the police! Don't move!
- Give me the phone!

20:29.015 --> 20:30.456
- You stay back.
- Give me your phone!

20:30.556 --> 20:34.181
Yeah, there's an intruder
in my home, a sexual predator.

20:34.306 --> 20:36.056
No, there's a murderer here!

20:36.181 --> 20:38.456
You're gonna pay for this, you pet-hunter!

20:38.556 --> 20:40.456
He was jerking off
in there while I... hey!

20:40.556 --> 20:43.248
What the... Jesus!

20:43.348 --> 20:45.348
Yeah, get out of here!

20:45.473 --> 20:47.415
Okay, just get here as soon as you can.

20:47.515 --> 20:50.223
Yeah, I'm armed.

20:50.348 --> 20:52.931
Hey, Morgan, come on!
You kids know better than that.

20:56.348 --> 20:59.498
Hello? Hello! Out of the way!

20:59.598 --> 21:00.681
Hey, Clinton, will you...

21:00.806 --> 21:02.498
Whoa, whoa! Stop the car! Police business!

21:02.598 --> 21:04.348
Get out of the street!

21:05.848 --> 21:08.015
I found the killer.

21:16.390 --> 21:18.390
You're absolutely sure about this?

21:18.515 --> 21:19.723
Yes, I'm sure.

21:19.848 --> 21:21.848
She struck me with a lead pipe. Look.

21:23.890 --> 21:26.165
Was there a mark there, or...

21:26.265 --> 21:27.848
I don't see anything.

21:27.973 --> 21:30.015
Just let me do the talking, okay?

21:33.681 --> 21:35.348
Calm down.

21:38.056 --> 21:39.890
Okay, don't let her get in your head.

21:40.015 --> 21:42.890
- Finally you show up.
- Excuse me?

21:43.015 --> 21:44.556
Wait, that's the guy!

21:44.681 --> 21:46.723
Cuff her, Hoyle. She's got a weapon.

21:46.848 --> 21:49.390
All right, what is going on here
with you two?

21:49.515 --> 21:52.998
This perv broke into my house,
watched me change,

21:53.098 --> 21:55.290
and then masturbated on my clothes.

21:55.390 --> 21:57.581
What the... no! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:57.681 --> 21:59.848
I was looking for evidence.
There was no masturbation.

21:59.973 --> 22:01.665
Why do you keep s... you pervert!

22:01.765 --> 22:04.665
- You broke in to her apartment?
- No, the door was unlocked.

22:04.765 --> 22:06.581
That's not important. She's a murderer.

22:06.681 --> 22:07.723
She killed Mouser.

22:07.848 --> 22:11.223
What the hell are you talking about?
I didn't kill any mice.

22:11.348 --> 22:14.790
The proof is on the walls!
Look. Look, right there!

22:14.890 --> 22:16.665
She lured Mouser in with her cheap bribes

22:16.765 --> 22:19.665
and her fancy cat food
and then pulled the trigger.

22:19.765 --> 22:22.415
Or the bow. His picture's right there!

22:22.515 --> 22:25.223
That's Horatio, my cat.

22:25.348 --> 22:27.915
Ma'am, is your cat here right now?

22:28.015 --> 22:31.348
Yeah! Yeah, smart. Where is Horatio?

22:33.056 --> 22:34.915
Uh, no. Uh...

22:35.015 --> 22:38.723
he's been missing for, like, a week,
but he disappears from time to time, so...

22:38.848 --> 22:40.665
Oh, bullshit!

22:40.765 --> 22:42.848
- Whoa, whoa!
- You...

22:42.973 --> 22:45.331
I think I know what's going on here, okay?

22:45.431 --> 22:49.264
You two owned the same cat.
He was moonlighting.

22:51.098 --> 22:53.389
What... what do you mean, "owned"?

22:53.514 --> 22:54.556
But that's impossible.

22:54.681 --> 22:56.331
Past tense?

22:56.431 --> 22:59.123
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, ma'am,

22:59.223 --> 23:03.414
but, uh, Horatio/Mouser

23:03.514 --> 23:06.014
was found dead yesterday.

23:06.139 --> 23:09.723
Ma'am, I know this is
a difficult moment, but, uh,

23:09.848 --> 23:12.306
would you mind if I take a quick look
around the apartment?

23:16.764 --> 23:19.223
- No.
- Thank you.

23:19.348 --> 23:21.414
Clinton, wait in the car.

23:21.514 --> 23:23.931
- I'm here if you need me.
- Wait in the car.

23:28.056 --> 23:30.889
So let me get this straight...
you're not gonna do one thing, then?

23:31.014 --> 23:32.889
I mean, not a damn thing?

23:33.014 --> 23:35.681
How did you even get that badge, man?
You're a quitter.

23:35.806 --> 23:38.914
Okay, first of all,
there is not a shred of actual evidence

23:39.014 --> 23:41.389
that that girl had anything
to do with this crime, Clinton.

23:41.514 --> 23:45.681
Second of all,
this is a police matter, okay?

23:45.806 --> 23:48.348
For police personnel.

23:51.098 --> 23:52.889
What are you trying to tell me?

23:57.306 --> 24:01.831
Look, I'm... I'm gonna turn a blind eye
to the whole breaking-and-entering fiasco,

24:01.931 --> 24:03.681
but you've got to stop.

24:03.806 --> 24:05.914
No more detective games, okay?

24:06.014 --> 24:08.014
I mean, we're talking about a cat, right?

24:08.139 --> 24:10.556
It's not the Lindbergh baby.

24:11.806 --> 24:13.973
That cat was my best friend.

24:36.514 --> 24:38.514
Hey, asshole.

24:38.639 --> 24:40.681
What are you doing here?
How'd you find my house?

24:40.806 --> 24:42.998
I looked up "dick hole"
in the white pages.

24:43.098 --> 24:45.914
Whoa, hey, don't you try anything.
My mom is inside.

24:46.014 --> 24:48.956
God, you're a real pussy when you
don't have a cop to hide behind.

24:49.056 --> 24:50.056
Why'd you do it?

24:51.514 --> 24:53.181
Will you stop with that?

24:54.681 --> 24:55.848
Show me my cat.

24:55.973 --> 24:57.389
No, no, no, no. Not a chance.

25:18.014 --> 25:19.889
Whoa, whoa.

25:21.514 --> 25:23.348
What are you doing? Just...

25:32.014 --> 25:33.848
Ow! Ow!

25:33.973 --> 25:36.056
Hey! What the hell's wrong with you?

25:50.764 --> 25:52.598
Horatio...

26:00.014 --> 26:01.973
"Mouser," right?

26:04.098 --> 26:05.723
Yep.

26:08.764 --> 26:10.681
This is nice...

26:12.223 --> 26:14.056
this burial here.

26:15.181 --> 26:16.889
Thank you.

26:18.681 --> 26:21.847
This... this was his favorite tree.

26:28.347 --> 26:30.681
Is this supposed to be Horatio?

26:30.806 --> 26:32.164
Oh...

26:32.264 --> 26:33.247
Smoking a cigarette?

26:33.347 --> 26:35.889
That is a work in progress.

26:36.014 --> 26:38.847
No one's supposed to see this, okay?

26:38.972 --> 26:41.056
The cigarette can come out, by the way.

26:41.181 --> 26:44.164
It just depends on which version
you buy, adult or children.

26:44.264 --> 26:45.639
I have a toy line.

26:46.681 --> 26:48.222
You have a toy line?

26:48.347 --> 26:50.122
Well, technically "lines"

26:50.222 --> 26:52.889
delineated by different worlds
and characters.

26:53.014 --> 26:55.347
Can we just stay on task?

26:55.472 --> 26:58.997
This is the murder weapon.
Be very careful.

26:59.097 --> 27:00.639
You should be wearing gloves.

27:05.681 --> 27:09.056
Mm. There's bite marks.

27:09.181 --> 27:11.056
He was trying to pull it out.

27:13.181 --> 27:16.222
Who would do something like this?

27:16.347 --> 27:18.556
I don't know, but I'm starting to think

27:18.681 --> 27:22.056
it was some kind of crazed Apache.

27:25.972 --> 27:28.014
They sell these at Ford's.

27:28.139 --> 27:30.247
Ford's Megastore?

27:30.347 --> 27:32.081
Yeah.

27:32.181 --> 27:34.847
I used to be an assistant manager there.

27:34.972 --> 27:37.056
They have a whole archery section.

27:37.181 --> 27:39.097
Please. I can't hear any more.

27:42.014 --> 27:44.014
I never thought I'd have
to set foot in that store.

27:47.056 --> 27:48.681
Let's roll.

27:50.222 --> 27:52.956
Oh, do you have a car
or just a way to get there?

27:53.056 --> 27:54.847
Otherwise, I should ask my mom.

28:00.389 --> 28:02.139
Oh! Whoa!

28:03.139 --> 28:05.122
Is this thing road-safe?

28:05.222 --> 28:07.847
So you live with your mom?

28:09.389 --> 28:10.956
God, that's brutal.

28:11.056 --> 28:13.831
It's actually a business decision,
if you must know.

28:13.931 --> 28:16.581
I run a small enterprise out of my home.

28:16.681 --> 28:18.639
My mother is an investor and the C.F.O.

28:20.764 --> 28:21.847
It's a live-work space.

28:21.972 --> 28:25.247
My bedroom is also an office
and an efficient repair shop.

28:25.347 --> 28:27.247
- Jesus.
- By the way, you're one to talk.

28:27.347 --> 28:29.014
You live with a bunch of geriatrics.

28:29.139 --> 28:32.747
I get a really good deal on rent
in exchange for cutting everyone's hair.

28:32.847 --> 28:35.247
And anyway, I like old people.
They're nice.

28:35.347 --> 28:36.389
They're peaceful.

28:55.347 --> 28:57.289
What's wrong with you?

28:57.389 --> 28:59.222
Nothing.

28:59.347 --> 29:01.306
I just haven't been here since I quit.

29:02.931 --> 29:04.389
Come on.

29:08.389 --> 29:10.831
Greta Chuplinski.

29:10.931 --> 29:14.014
Back from retirement.
Am I that irresistible?

29:14.139 --> 29:16.431
Eat my balls, Yi.

29:19.431 --> 29:22.014
You know where this came from?

29:22.139 --> 29:24.347
Can't you see I'm on break?

29:28.347 --> 29:30.681
Oh, howdy. How can I help you two?

29:30.806 --> 29:32.722
You know where this arrow came from?

29:32.847 --> 29:34.831
Well, that's not an arrow, that is a bolt.

29:34.931 --> 29:36.081
A bolt?

29:36.181 --> 29:38.847
Yes, a bolt, for a crossbow.

29:38.972 --> 29:41.347
It looks like an arrow,
but it's significantly heavier,

29:41.472 --> 29:44.222
has vastly different
flight characteristics.

29:44.347 --> 29:46.389
This one in particular

29:46.514 --> 29:49.055
belongs to the Sure Shot 5000 series.

29:49.180 --> 29:51.555
Show it to me.

29:52.805 --> 29:55.497
It's a quality crossbow.
Manufactured in China.

29:55.597 --> 29:57.955
Guangzhou, I believe.

29:58.055 --> 30:00.014
Is this a popular model?

30:00.139 --> 30:02.055
Actually, Sure Shot's a fledgling company.

30:02.180 --> 30:04.164
We're the only ones
in the country who carry it.

30:04.264 --> 30:06.180
But she's a real beaut, though.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.847
I mean, it's a fine bow.

30:07.972 --> 30:10.497
Look at the craftsmanship on this baby.

30:10.597 --> 30:12.514
Titanium barrel, nickel inlay.

30:12.639 --> 30:14.555
She's a true shot. Packs a real wallop.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.014
You could take down a rabbit
at full stride from 100 feet.

30:17.139 --> 30:19.955
Pow! I mean, not "pow,"
'cause it's a crossbow, but "pfft!"

30:20.055 --> 30:22.389
My cat was murdered with that thing.

30:24.430 --> 30:26.997
- My cat, too.
- Two cats?

30:27.097 --> 30:29.664
No, one cat, two owners.

30:29.764 --> 30:32.247
One cat, two cat, three cat, blue cat!

30:32.347 --> 30:33.680
Does it matter?

30:33.805 --> 30:37.080
He's dead, and the blood is on your hands!

30:37.180 --> 30:38.164
Please, sir!

30:38.264 --> 30:40.180
- Who'd you sell it to?
- Excuse me?

30:40.305 --> 30:43.080
Who'd you sell the murder
weapon to, death master?

30:43.180 --> 30:44.289
Clinton, what are you...

30:44.389 --> 30:47.622
Hi, everybody, what's, uh...
what's going on over here?

30:47.722 --> 30:49.972
Steve? Huh?

30:51.889 --> 30:53.389
Greta?

30:55.597 --> 30:57.789
- You're...
- The commercial.

30:57.889 --> 31:01.414
Al Ford. How are you?
What's the problem here, Steve?

31:01.514 --> 31:03.164
He called me "death master."

31:03.264 --> 31:06.180
"Death master"?
What is this "death master"?

31:06.305 --> 31:09.014
Your crossbow killed my best friend.

31:09.139 --> 31:10.514
Oh, my God.

31:10.639 --> 31:12.080
He means his cat.

31:12.180 --> 31:13.914
Oh. Right, right.

31:14.014 --> 31:16.122
I think I read that in the "Beacon."

31:16.222 --> 31:18.889
Very, very sorry to hear
about that, son, honestly.

31:19.014 --> 31:22.122
That somebody might
use a product of mine from this store

31:22.222 --> 31:25.164
in that sort of way just... it kills me.

31:25.264 --> 31:27.597
If there's anything I can do,
anything at all, you let me know.

31:28.847 --> 31:31.497
Um, okay. Thank you, yes.

31:31.597 --> 31:34.414
I'd appreciate the names and information

31:34.514 --> 31:36.289
of every single person
who bought this thing.

31:36.389 --> 31:37.389
That I cannot do.

31:37.514 --> 31:39.555
You shit-faced phony!

31:39.680 --> 31:42.580
- God damn it, Clinton, come on.
- Excuse me?

31:42.680 --> 31:45.180
We have privacy policies
here at this store, sir.

31:45.305 --> 31:48.180
Listen, we just want to take a quick look

31:48.305 --> 31:50.580
at the sales inventory to see
the people who bought this thing,

31:50.680 --> 31:52.014
and then we'll get out of here.

31:53.305 --> 31:57.180
Miss Chuplinski, as you well know,

31:57.305 --> 31:59.847
what you're asking for
is strictly against store policy.

31:59.972 --> 32:02.180
Now, I might have been able to bend
the rules a little bit here,

32:02.305 --> 32:04.680
but just quitting without any notice?

32:04.805 --> 32:07.722
Leaving us all stranded here?

32:07.847 --> 32:11.055
Particularly in Home Patios
during barbecue season.

32:11.180 --> 32:13.497
Failure to return your vest, Greta?

32:13.597 --> 32:17.889
All of this demonstrates blatant
disregard for this establishment.

32:19.097 --> 32:21.847
Now, that said,
my office is always open to you.

32:24.014 --> 32:25.664
I'm out of here.

32:25.764 --> 32:28.680
Wait. What, you're going?

32:28.805 --> 32:32.247
Just show me the goddamn inventory, Ford.

32:32.347 --> 32:33.622
Can't do that.

32:33.722 --> 32:36.139
You really are a sham.

32:40.764 --> 32:43.222
Can you leave my store, please?

32:43.347 --> 32:45.264
All right, all right.

32:47.764 --> 32:49.847
You want to play hardball?

32:51.805 --> 32:54.305
You've got yourself a hardball game.

33:13.388 --> 33:16.622
What is this all about?
What are you protesting?

33:16.722 --> 33:20.555
Wh... what am I...
isn't it obvious? Ford's.

33:20.680 --> 33:23.580
This store puts innocent lives at risk.

33:23.680 --> 33:28.055
Oh, my God! He's... he's just a boy!

33:28.180 --> 33:29.622
Exactly.

33:29.722 --> 33:32.222
And a very noble one.
He's fasting in protest.

33:32.347 --> 33:34.013
Or he will.

33:34.138 --> 33:36.180
I'm bored. Let me down.

33:36.305 --> 33:39.055
You want your 30 bucks or not?
Just keep drumming.

33:43.430 --> 33:47.013
"Boo!" yeah, again! Boo!

33:51.638 --> 33:53.430
Let me call you back.

33:54.513 --> 33:56.055
Hi, Frank.

33:56.180 --> 33:58.122
- Al.
- Sorry about this.

33:58.222 --> 34:00.913
Yeah. Is that the Johnson boy up there?

34:01.013 --> 34:02.997
Yeah. Can they get him down or...

34:03.097 --> 34:05.080
yeah, they're... They'll get on it.

34:05.180 --> 34:06.788
What about Clinton? Do you need any...

34:06.888 --> 34:08.679
No, no, no.

34:08.804 --> 34:13.013
You hear that? They're booing you, Ford.

34:13.138 --> 34:14.246
You're finished.

34:14.347 --> 34:15.888
They're booing you, you idiot.

34:16.013 --> 34:19.888
Now, look, I told the sheriff not to
intervene here, but you need to stop this.

34:20.013 --> 34:22.513
Hi, everybody.

34:22.638 --> 34:24.847
You are completely out of line here, son.

34:24.972 --> 34:29.222
What's out of line is your store, your
products, and everything you stand for.

34:32.472 --> 34:36.330
Kid, I'm a business owner. Okay?

34:36.429 --> 34:39.888
Amongst other things,
I sell, uh, sporting goods here,

34:42.597 --> 34:46.388
some of which is used
for what we call shooting sports.

34:46.513 --> 34:47.830
Now, I'm no maverick.

34:47.929 --> 34:50.080
Similar stores to mine
all across the country.

34:50.179 --> 34:51.996
I'm sorry about your cat.

34:52.097 --> 34:54.013
I am. I like cats.

34:54.138 --> 34:56.955
But frankly, it's not my problem.

34:57.054 --> 34:59.330
You choke on a McNugget,
do blame McDonald's?

34:59.430 --> 35:01.055
Yeah.

35:01.180 --> 35:03.347
I bet you do, you little pinhead.

35:03.472 --> 35:05.055
Listen, this whole charade is pointless.

35:05.180 --> 35:06.888
All right. We'll see about that.

35:07.013 --> 35:08.663
No, we won't see, God damn it.

35:08.763 --> 35:10.580
The Sure Shot 5000 is a bust.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.663
Okay, you want the inventory information?

35:12.763 --> 35:15.888
I'll give it to you.
Zero models have been sold.

35:16.013 --> 35:17.788
Zero. Do you get me?

35:17.888 --> 35:20.680
- It didn't come from my store.
- That's impossible.

35:20.805 --> 35:22.747
It's a fact.

35:22.847 --> 35:24.788
Now, quit making a fool out of yourself

35:24.888 --> 35:26.888
before I change my mind
about pressing charges.

35:35.013 --> 35:38.497
Greta, we need to talk.

35:38.597 --> 35:40.497
Wow. Hi, Clinton.

35:40.597 --> 35:42.680
Yeah, come on in.
Just make yourself at home.

35:42.805 --> 35:46.597
It's about the crossbows.
We've hit a wall.

35:49.013 --> 35:52.663
I'm sorry, Irv.
Can you excuse us for a second?

35:52.763 --> 35:54.680
Yeah.

35:57.347 --> 35:59.913
Remember, she's my girl.

36:00.013 --> 36:02.222
All right, okay.

36:03.847 --> 36:06.497
Were you cutting Mouser's hair?

36:06.597 --> 36:08.497
Yeah.

36:08.597 --> 36:11.955
I needed the practice,
and his hair was a mess.

36:12.055 --> 36:13.013
What?

36:13.138 --> 36:15.555
It was... it was untamed and beautiful.

36:15.680 --> 36:17.888
I thought it was my best work.
Why are you all sweaty?

36:18.013 --> 36:19.888
I broke Ford.

36:20.013 --> 36:23.388
He claims no crossbows were sold,
but it doesn't add up.

36:23.513 --> 36:26.247
Really? None?

36:26.347 --> 36:27.747
I don't know what to say.

36:27.847 --> 36:29.722
I mean, maybe they came
from "zang-zing" or whatever.

36:29.847 --> 36:31.955
Or maybe Ford is lying.

36:32.055 --> 36:34.330
The crossbow had to come from his store.

36:34.430 --> 36:36.955
But this is a publicity nightmare for him.

36:37.055 --> 36:40.513
Mr. Family Values
is trying to protect his image.

36:40.638 --> 36:44.496
Something is definitely off,
and I'm gonna find out what.

36:44.596 --> 36:45.721
Are you with me?

36:47.221 --> 36:48.955
I don't know, Clinton.

36:49.055 --> 36:51.163
What the hell is going on with you?

36:51.263 --> 36:54.455
You ditch me at Ford's, and now you're
just giving up? I need your help.

36:54.555 --> 36:55.680
I'm not giving up.

36:55.805 --> 36:59.580
It's just the police and Ford's?
I mean, it's too much.

36:59.680 --> 37:00.721
It's not worth it.

37:00.846 --> 37:02.888
"Too much"? Are you not hearing me?

37:03.013 --> 37:04.721
Ford is full of shit.

37:04.846 --> 37:06.721
Their crossbow killed Mouser,

37:06.846 --> 37:09.621
Horatio, our cat.

37:09.721 --> 37:13.221
These are the same scumbags
who drove my business out of town.

37:13.346 --> 37:15.246
They think they can just
push around the little guy.

37:15.346 --> 37:17.955
Well, this time the little guy
is gonna push back.

37:18.055 --> 37:19.971
Are you with me?

37:24.763 --> 37:27.138
Are we done? I have a customer coming.

37:31.055 --> 37:33.621
Okay. Yeah.

37:33.721 --> 37:35.596
We're done.

38:38.096 --> 38:39.263
Reilly.

38:40.513 --> 38:41.846
Doghouse Reilly.

38:44.180 --> 38:46.513
Ma? Can I get a ride to Ford's?

39:08.346 --> 39:09.721
Hey.

39:11.513 --> 39:13.263
What the hell do you think you're doin'?

39:15.763 --> 39:17.221
Who are you?

39:17.346 --> 39:18.763
Uh, I'm the new guy.

39:19.805 --> 39:21.013
Greta.

39:25.763 --> 39:26.846
Okay.

39:56.221 --> 39:58.121
I know it, brother.

39:58.221 --> 40:01.121
Another day, another dollar.

40:01.221 --> 40:04.121
We got to keep our nose to the grindstone,

40:04.221 --> 40:06.096
so to speak.

40:13.179 --> 40:15.346
Ugh! Something was wrong with mine.

40:16.846 --> 40:19.221
So where are we keeping
those Sure Shot 5000s

40:19.346 --> 40:22.013
everyone's talking about?

40:22.138 --> 40:24.013
"Everyone's talking about"?

40:24.138 --> 40:25.913
I don't know.

40:26.013 --> 40:27.846
Check sports, row G-12.

40:30.096 --> 40:31.679
Thanks for the smoke, brother.

40:51.638 --> 40:52.763
Damn it.

40:55.554 --> 40:57.554
Yi, get over here!

41:05.513 --> 41:08.829
What have I told you about smoking
in the warehouse? Huh?

41:08.929 --> 41:11.388
Put it out. Now.

41:17.638 --> 41:19.454
What are you doing?

41:19.554 --> 41:21.221
No smoking.

41:24.054 --> 41:25.888
Oh. What's that over there?

41:27.179 --> 41:29.913
Oh, and is there something you
want to give me

41:30.013 --> 41:31.346
from your pocket?

41:31.471 --> 41:33.138
Hello.

41:36.513 --> 41:37.679
Get back to work.

41:40.221 --> 41:41.221
Mute.

41:41.346 --> 41:46.179
We need to get these boxes to our man
by 4:00 sharp, so no ice-cream breaks.

41:46.304 --> 41:49.888
And, Dave,
if you get a flat tire this time,

41:51.179 --> 41:53.054
do not call the police.

41:54.513 --> 41:55.888
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

41:57.263 --> 41:58.971
Chin up, tenderfoot.

41:59.096 --> 42:00.846
I still have faith in you.

42:18.513 --> 42:19.513
Bingo.

43:52.429 --> 43:54.471
What are you doin', man?
What are you doin'?

44:10.679 --> 44:11.804
Greta.

44:21.096 --> 44:22.887
Excuse me.

44:34.804 --> 44:37.121
'Cause, you know, I prefer the sativa.

44:37.221 --> 44:40.496
That hemp star you gave me
was just too soporific.

44:40.596 --> 44:44.121
Ideally, I'd love the high to be strong
during office hours

44:44.221 --> 44:46.554
but peak during lecture.

44:46.679 --> 44:48.554
Try this, Howie. I think you'll like it.

44:50.221 --> 44:51.496
Bravo.

44:51.596 --> 44:53.871
Greta, we need to talk.

44:53.971 --> 44:56.621
Oh, Clinton. Holy shit.

44:56.721 --> 44:58.704
Okay. Hold on.

44:58.804 --> 45:01.579
This is for you, and we're good here?

45:01.679 --> 45:03.596
I've never seen you. Thank you.

45:05.387 --> 45:07.512
Listen, I was chased

45:07.637 --> 45:10.912
all the way here by a giant machine.

45:11.012 --> 45:12.912
He was a running machine.

45:13.012 --> 45:14.912
I am lucky to be alive.

45:15.012 --> 45:17.121
He was so fast, so big...

45:17.221 --> 45:19.246
Okay, okay. Calm down.

45:19.346 --> 45:21.221
Just take a second.

45:23.179 --> 45:25.179
Clinton, what the hell happened to you?

45:25.304 --> 45:27.137
I broke into Ford's warehouse.

45:27.262 --> 45:29.412
- You what?
- Yes. Shh. Okay?

45:29.512 --> 45:32.579
It was very dangerous,
but this is what I do, Greta.

45:32.679 --> 45:35.621
I'm like a clever mongoose, okay?

45:35.721 --> 45:38.137
Now, listen, it's deeper
than we thought, okay?

45:38.262 --> 45:40.579
The Sure Shots, Ford's...
it's all connected.

45:40.679 --> 45:44.554
That's obvious, but, I mean,
there's something bigger going on,

45:44.679 --> 45:46.496
like a theft ring or something.

45:46.596 --> 45:47.679
That guy, Kim Chi?

45:47.804 --> 45:49.679
Kim Ch... Yi Kim?

45:49.804 --> 45:52.679
Right. There's something off about him.

45:52.804 --> 45:54.679
Yeah, to say the least.

45:54.804 --> 45:56.679
Oh, what's that mean?

45:56.804 --> 45:58.621
I mean, he's weird.

45:58.721 --> 46:00.704
Like, maybe the weirdest person I know.

46:00.804 --> 46:03.137
Well, I'm... I'm weird.

46:03.262 --> 46:05.621
I mean, I'm a friggin' weirdo.

46:05.721 --> 46:07.579
You're minor-league weird.

46:07.679 --> 46:09.679
I'm talking hall-of-fame weird.

46:09.804 --> 46:13.512
Like, if Prince and Pee-Wee Herman had
a baby, it wouldn't play with Yi Kim.

46:14.887 --> 46:17.179
Whatever. It's not a competition, Greta.

46:17.304 --> 46:20.846
Listen, the point is that Liu Kang
and his man-child

46:20.971 --> 46:23.079
are stealing from the store, all right?

46:23.179 --> 46:26.912
They're using the unsold crossbow boxes
as a cover somehow.

46:27.012 --> 46:30.579
They're boosters, dropping off
the stolen goods to a fence.

46:30.679 --> 46:32.704
- A fence?
- A middleman.

46:32.804 --> 46:35.787
He unloads the hot items.
You never read "The Hardy Boys"?

46:35.887 --> 46:37.329
"Three Investigators"?

46:37.429 --> 46:40.662
All I know is that carnival masker
and his silent giant

46:40.762 --> 46:43.971
are the only two
to have access to the crossbows.

46:45.721 --> 46:46.746
W... what?

46:46.846 --> 46:48.704
What is it? What?

46:48.804 --> 46:50.704
Nothing.

46:50.804 --> 46:52.496
Nothing?

46:52.596 --> 46:56.637
You're acting all tense and weird,
and you tore your coaster to shreds.

47:02.221 --> 47:03.662
You knew about this.

47:03.762 --> 47:06.954
Clinton, that's crazy.
What are you talking about?

47:07.054 --> 47:09.679
Two Glenlivets, neat.

47:09.804 --> 47:13.679
Oh, hey, we're having
a private discussion here.

47:13.804 --> 47:16.554
- If we wanted to include you...
- Simmer down, darlin'.

47:16.679 --> 47:18.804
It's courtesy of the gentleman over there.

47:37.762 --> 47:39.304
Shit.

47:44.887 --> 47:46.179
I remember.

47:50.804 --> 47:53.720
I don't think we've officially met.
Yi Kim.

47:55.137 --> 47:56.679
That's Dave Calvetti.

47:58.012 --> 47:59.595
I didn't catch your name.

48:02.095 --> 48:03.245
Clint...

48:03.345 --> 48:05.704
- Excuse?
- It's Clinton.

48:05.804 --> 48:07.245
Clint.

48:07.345 --> 48:08.970
Clinton.

48:09.095 --> 48:10.179
Ton.

48:13.262 --> 48:15.054
Your shot's collecting dust.

48:17.137 --> 48:18.620
I don't...... I don't really

48:18.720 --> 48:22.137
Drink... it.

48:30.054 --> 48:31.304
Whoo!

48:31.429 --> 48:32.970
Oh!

48:34.179 --> 48:37.037
Let's go for a little walk, hmm?

48:37.137 --> 48:40.287
The varnish in this place, it...

48:40.387 --> 48:43.387
smells like sadness.

48:47.387 --> 48:49.079
Yi, where the hell are we going?

48:49.179 --> 48:51.179
We're going on a little trip, Greta bear.

48:54.220 --> 48:57.345
So, Clinton, you like Greta, huh?

49:00.762 --> 49:03.512
Oh. You don't say much, do you?

49:03.637 --> 49:05.912
You must be complicated.

49:06.012 --> 49:08.345
We all know how Greta loves a challenge.

49:08.470 --> 49:10.037
All right, what is this, huh?

49:10.137 --> 49:11.829
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

49:11.929 --> 49:13.912
Take it easy.

49:14.012 --> 49:15.679
You'll see.

49:25.429 --> 49:28.287
All right, this is getting old, Yi.

49:28.387 --> 49:31.120
Come on, Clinton, let's go.

49:31.220 --> 49:32.304
Hey!

49:32.429 --> 49:35.304
All right, look, Kano,
or whatever your name is,

49:35.429 --> 49:37.704
I don't know what you're trying to pull,
but I know what's going on.

49:37.804 --> 49:39.829
Ah! Oh, Christ!

49:39.929 --> 49:41.179
Hey!

49:41.304 --> 49:43.204
Hey, we're all friends here.

49:43.304 --> 49:47.137
We all trust each other, don't we?

49:51.845 --> 49:54.304
Let go of her!

49:54.429 --> 49:58.079
Whoo! Oh, I am feeling it!

49:58.179 --> 50:00.662
You feeling it, Dave? Huh?

50:00.762 --> 50:02.370
Whoo! Love it!

50:02.470 --> 50:04.662
You feeling it, Clintonio?

50:04.762 --> 50:06.787
I... uh...

50:06.887 --> 50:09.179
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

50:10.137 --> 50:12.120
Give me your hand.

50:12.220 --> 50:15.137
Now, do we trust each other? Huh?

50:15.262 --> 50:17.412
- Please! Stop!
- We're in this together now.

50:17.512 --> 50:18.637
Please!

50:20.512 --> 50:22.454
Please, Yi, don't do this!

50:22.554 --> 50:27.204
You've been a nosy little kitty cat.

50:27.304 --> 50:28.554
But I trust you now.

50:32.470 --> 50:35.012
No. There's no one else.

50:35.137 --> 50:37.412
I don't have to
justify anything to you, okay?

50:37.512 --> 50:39.470
Just stay out of my life.

50:55.387 --> 50:57.787
How... how did I get here?

50:57.887 --> 51:00.845
Uh, we walked.

51:00.970 --> 51:03.137
Well, I sort of carried you.

51:03.262 --> 51:05.578
I don't remember any of that.

51:05.678 --> 51:08.512
Oh, my God. Do I have a memory loss?

51:08.637 --> 51:10.553
Was I hit by the train?

51:10.678 --> 51:12.845
Yeah, if that's what you consider
Dave Calvetti.

51:12.970 --> 51:15.595
You're fine. You're just
a little bruised, that's all.

51:19.095 --> 51:21.553
- I gotta go. I gotta...
- No, wait. No, wait.

51:21.678 --> 51:23.595
Stay here. Stay here.

51:25.637 --> 51:27.870
My God.

51:27.970 --> 51:29.678
Ew.

51:29.803 --> 51:31.512
Ow. Ah...

51:31.637 --> 51:33.578
Here. Try this.

51:33.678 --> 51:35.137
It's my special recipe.

51:39.053 --> 51:40.787
Oh, my God. What is this?

51:40.887 --> 51:42.912
Just boiled whiskey?

51:43.012 --> 51:45.345
Yeah, pretty much.

51:50.970 --> 51:53.662
Hey. Who's this guy?

51:53.762 --> 51:56.720
- Come on.
- Did you make him, too?

51:58.928 --> 52:00.095
Yeah.

52:05.803 --> 52:09.262
Kind of look like they go together.
Are they partners?

52:11.762 --> 52:13.178
Yeah.

52:14.803 --> 52:16.953
That's pretty good.

52:17.053 --> 52:18.637
How long have you been doing this?

52:20.053 --> 52:22.703
Oh, I don't know.
Since I was a kid, I guess.

52:22.803 --> 52:25.053
So you had your own little workshop?

52:26.095 --> 52:28.912
I used to run around in tighty-whities
and a trench coat

52:29.012 --> 52:30.928
and interrogate strangers.

52:32.845 --> 52:34.137
Pretty cute.

52:34.262 --> 52:36.345
I was 15.

52:39.470 --> 52:40.578
Okay.

52:40.678 --> 52:42.720
I was imaginative.

52:44.512 --> 52:47.828
Yeah. Sounds like you were a handful.

52:47.928 --> 52:50.828
What'd your parents think?

52:50.928 --> 52:53.412
Well, my dad hated it.

52:53.512 --> 52:55.537
"Puss-bag"...
that's what he used to call me.

52:55.637 --> 52:59.137
"Puss-bag"? What does that even mean?

52:59.262 --> 53:01.178
I don't know.

53:01.303 --> 53:04.845
"Puss," like "pussy," and, like, "bag,"

53:04.970 --> 53:07.470
like a bag of it, like a...

53:07.595 --> 53:09.470
like a bag of... of pussies.

53:09.595 --> 53:11.512
Like a bag full of pussies, I guess.

53:11.637 --> 53:14.178
I don't know. It doesn't make any sense.

53:16.220 --> 53:17.970
He sounds like an asshole.

53:18.970 --> 53:20.845
You still live with him?

53:20.970 --> 53:22.845
Oh, hell, no.

53:22.970 --> 53:25.912
He moved on to greener pastures,

53:26.012 --> 53:30.012
and he's got some new family in Texas

53:30.137 --> 53:33.845
and owns some puss-bag store.

53:33.970 --> 53:36.220
I don't know.

53:40.720 --> 53:42.262
What?

53:46.012 --> 53:47.053
What?

53:48.262 --> 53:49.828
Get up.

53:49.928 --> 53:52.953
I want to do something for you. Come on.

53:53.053 --> 53:55.303
- What...
- Don't argue with me.

53:57.595 --> 54:00.053
Whoa. No, no, no, no.
I don't know about this.

54:29.845 --> 54:31.636
What do you think?

54:33.303 --> 54:36.053
It's... I don't know.

54:37.053 --> 54:38.470
Okay.

54:39.803 --> 54:40.828
You look older.

54:40.928 --> 54:42.178
Oh, great, thanks.

54:42.303 --> 54:44.178
That was a compliment.

54:44.303 --> 54:46.578
I was saying you look handsome.

54:46.678 --> 54:48.411
You know, like a man.

54:48.511 --> 54:51.761
Yeah, I don't know
if I want to look like a man.

54:54.011 --> 54:55.178
I like it.

55:24.303 --> 55:26.720
Are you sure you want this?

55:28.886 --> 55:30.303
What do you mean?

55:30.428 --> 55:33.203
I need someone to be with me.

55:33.303 --> 55:36.803
With you, like... to find Mouser's killer?

55:39.095 --> 55:40.786
Is that all you can think about?

55:40.886 --> 55:43.286
I'm not sure what we're talking about.

55:43.386 --> 55:46.620
Our cat is dead, Clinton,

55:46.720 --> 55:48.970
but he brought us together.

55:49.095 --> 55:51.886
To find his killer.

55:54.928 --> 55:58.803
My life has enough problems.

55:58.928 --> 56:00.911
You can't just run around in a trench coat

56:01.011 --> 56:02.536
and tighty-whities forever.

56:02.636 --> 56:05.286
Okay. I see how it is.

56:05.386 --> 56:08.411
No, you don't.
That's what I'm trying to say...

56:08.511 --> 56:10.178
I know what you're trying to say.

56:12.970 --> 56:14.720
You're just like everybody else.

56:16.470 --> 56:18.845
Hey.

56:18.970 --> 56:21.845
I knew about the scam, okay?

56:23.303 --> 56:25.011
Why do you think I left the store?

56:26.261 --> 56:29.036
Don't you get it? Yi's dangerous.

56:29.136 --> 56:31.036
It's not worth it.

56:31.136 --> 56:33.595
Let it go, Clinton.

56:37.595 --> 56:39.553
Thanks for the tip.

57:04.636 --> 57:05.845
Who is that?

57:51.844 --> 57:54.703
Clinton! You're up.

57:54.803 --> 57:56.411
Good morning.

57:56.511 --> 58:01.036
Clinton, honey,
you remember Frank, don't you?

58:01.136 --> 58:03.803
No, actually. I don't know any Frank.

58:03.928 --> 58:07.203
I know a Sheriff Hoyle, but no...

58:07.303 --> 58:08.969
is he wearing my robe?

58:09.094 --> 58:12.203
Honey, I didn't know if you were...

58:12.303 --> 58:15.036
coming home last night, and...

58:15.136 --> 58:18.203
- Don't worry, Clinton, I'll wash it.
- No, don't bother.

58:18.303 --> 58:20.636
It's just one of the few creature comforts

58:20.761 --> 58:23.286
to which I've ever
really been attached, but burn it,

58:23.386 --> 58:27.286
because I am never wearing
that thing again as long as I live.

58:27.386 --> 58:30.469
Hey, you got a haircut.
It looks very distinguished.

58:30.594 --> 58:31.678
It does.

58:31.803 --> 58:33.286
Would you stop talking about my hair?

58:33.386 --> 58:35.953
Honey, why don't you just
sit down for a second, huh?

58:36.053 --> 58:37.844
And eat something. Look what I made.

58:37.969 --> 58:41.636
Chocolate pancake... oops.
Sorry. I'll eat that one.

58:41.761 --> 58:43.636
You take that one. And bacon.

58:43.761 --> 58:47.428
Yeah, only because there's
people starving in the world.

58:51.844 --> 58:55.453
Where have you been, Clinton?
I've been worried about you.

58:55.553 --> 58:58.036
Really? You were worried?

58:58.136 --> 59:02.369
You had time to worry during your
sex-capades with this doughnut-husker?

59:02.469 --> 59:04.869
- Hey, come on, now. Watch your mouth.
- You watch your mouth.

59:04.969 --> 59:07.119
This is my house,
and I can act however I want.

59:07.219 --> 59:08.844
Actually, you know, it's my house,

59:08.969 --> 59:11.678
and is it too much to ask
for you to just be nice for once?

59:12.719 --> 59:14.178
Nice?

59:17.261 --> 59:19.219
Okay. I'll be nice.

59:22.886 --> 59:25.703
I got a nice little tip for you.

59:25.803 --> 59:28.203
She's got the gout.

59:28.303 --> 59:31.303
Real bad.
That's why she always wears socks.

59:43.178 --> 59:45.928
I have... chilly feet.

59:50.844 --> 59:53.844
Clinton, look,
I know this is a little bit awkward,

59:54.844 --> 59:57.136
but I'd like for us to try and be friends.

01:00:01.053 --> 01:00:02.869
All right.

01:00:02.969 --> 01:00:04.703
Let's be friends.

01:00:04.803 --> 01:00:07.744
I found out who killed Mouser,
and I want to go there today.

01:00:07.844 --> 01:00:08.869
Come on. What is this?

01:00:08.969 --> 01:00:11.844
Yi Kim, he's the one who killed Mouser,

01:00:11.969 --> 01:00:14.244
and I want to nail him, Hoyle, today, now.

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:17.911
You mean Rogin Kim's son,
of Kim's Tuxedos?

01:00:18.011 --> 01:00:20.703
I don't want to assume,
but probably, right?

01:00:20.803 --> 01:00:23.953
Speaking of which, you might want to case
that joint, see if the money's clean.

01:00:24.053 --> 01:00:25.703
As for Yi, he is filthy.

01:00:25.803 --> 01:00:30.286
He's running this huge scam involving
crossbows and computers out of Ford's.

01:00:30.386 --> 01:00:32.844
He killed Mouser
to put the scare into Greta.

01:00:32.969 --> 01:00:34.869
She's the one who stole Mouser.

01:00:34.969 --> 01:00:37.469
She quit Ford's
after she learned of the scam.

01:00:37.594 --> 01:00:39.803
Frankly, this all sounds
pretty ridiculous.

01:00:39.928 --> 01:00:42.761
You're doing it,
or I'm driving you out of here.

01:00:44.886 --> 01:00:47.053
All right.
I got a little time before my shift.

01:00:50.303 --> 01:00:52.303
Mmm!

01:01:01.178 --> 01:01:02.344
Hey.

01:01:06.886 --> 01:01:08.053
You left this.

01:01:14.052 --> 01:01:15.844
I was hoping maybe we could talk.

01:01:20.261 --> 01:01:21.802
I'm sorry things got...

01:01:23.052 --> 01:01:24.136
weird last night.

01:01:26.011 --> 01:01:29.119
Excuse me, Clinton, I think we'd better
get going if we're gonna do this.

01:01:29.219 --> 01:01:32.302
Yeah. Yeah, just warm 'er up, Hoyle.

01:01:32.427 --> 01:01:35.244
I'll meet you in the squad car
in T-minus one minute.

01:01:35.344 --> 01:01:36.511
What are you doing?

01:01:37.969 --> 01:01:41.036
I'm taking care of a little thing
called justice.

01:01:41.136 --> 01:01:44.427
It's not a good day to be Yi Kim,
if you know what I mean.

01:01:46.344 --> 01:01:48.452
Clinton, please don't do this.

01:01:48.552 --> 01:01:50.969
I'm telling you, it'll come back to us.

01:01:52.552 --> 01:01:53.552
Right.

01:01:54.969 --> 01:01:55.969
Excuse me.

01:01:57.427 --> 01:01:58.786
Clinton!

01:01:58.886 --> 01:02:01.094
This ends today.

01:02:07.844 --> 01:02:10.077
Rich, spoiled bastard.

01:02:10.177 --> 01:02:12.119
Makes you sick, right?

01:02:12.219 --> 01:02:16.344
Look, Clinton, what we're doing here
is not exactly department protocol, okay?

01:02:16.469 --> 01:02:19.244
So you can't go poking around in there,

01:02:19.344 --> 01:02:20.786
making accusations.

01:02:20.886 --> 01:02:22.786
We don't have a warrant.

01:02:22.886 --> 01:02:25.469
Just... let me do the talking, okay?

01:02:25.594 --> 01:02:28.869
I got it. I got it. Silent muscle.

01:02:28.969 --> 01:02:30.077
And don't worry.

01:02:30.177 --> 01:02:32.952
This place is gonna be stacked
to the ceiling with stolen product.

01:02:33.052 --> 01:02:35.677
I'm pretty much
handing you an easy collar.

01:02:40.594 --> 01:02:42.052
Let's nail this perp.

01:02:54.469 --> 01:02:55.969
Oh. All right.

01:03:04.636 --> 01:03:06.702
Who the hell are you? Where's Yi Kim?

01:03:06.802 --> 01:03:08.452
Whoa.

01:03:08.552 --> 01:03:09.869
Hi, sweetie. Is your father home?

01:03:09.969 --> 01:03:12.677
Dad!

01:03:12.802 --> 01:03:14.802
I bet he heard that.

01:03:14.927 --> 01:03:16.577
May we come inside?

01:03:16.677 --> 01:03:19.536
The police need to speak
to your brother. He's in trouble.

01:03:19.636 --> 01:03:21.594
We'll wait for your daddy.

01:03:24.802 --> 01:03:25.802
Yi.

01:03:27.636 --> 01:03:29.802
What's going on, Dad?

01:03:29.927 --> 01:03:31.844
Some people here to talk to you.

01:03:31.969 --> 01:03:34.036
Yi, I'm sheriff Hoyle. I'd...

01:03:34.136 --> 01:03:37.744
Wow. That is... that's your sister, right?

01:03:37.844 --> 01:03:40.202
- That is outstanding.
- Oh, thank you.

01:03:40.302 --> 01:03:42.511
I'm still struggling with it, you know?

01:03:42.636 --> 01:03:44.702
Oak is such a tricky medium.

01:03:44.802 --> 01:03:46.677
Still trying to work
on the eyelashes, but...

01:03:46.802 --> 01:03:48.036
Beautiful.

01:03:48.136 --> 01:03:49.952
Thank you, Officer.

01:03:50.052 --> 01:03:52.202
Anyway, what's, uh... what's going on?

01:03:52.302 --> 01:03:54.136
Don't act like you don't know.

01:03:54.261 --> 01:03:56.577
You know exactly why we're here, Yi.

01:03:56.677 --> 01:03:58.202
It's Clinton, right?

01:03:58.302 --> 01:04:00.511
You got it, Yi.

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:02.511
- Hi.
- It's over.

01:04:02.636 --> 01:04:04.511
I've already told him everything...

01:04:04.636 --> 01:04:07.119
the store, the threat, my cat.

01:04:07.219 --> 01:04:10.577
Just come clean now,
and we might be able to cut you a deal.

01:04:10.677 --> 01:04:12.202
We can do that, right, Hoyle?

01:04:12.302 --> 01:04:13.786
Shut up, Clinton.

01:04:13.886 --> 01:04:16.761
Yi, can you tell me about what happened
yesterday at the Megastore?

01:04:18.927 --> 01:04:20.619
Well...

01:04:20.719 --> 01:04:23.136
I wanted to be forgiving
about this whole thing.

01:04:23.261 --> 01:04:25.869
I didn't want to report it, but...

01:04:25.969 --> 01:04:27.969
I guess I just don't have a choice.

01:04:29.636 --> 01:04:32.244
Clinton broke into the warehouse
at Ford's Megastore yesterday.

01:04:32.344 --> 01:04:35.536
Call me a softy, but he was apologetic,

01:04:35.636 --> 01:04:37.536
and I accepted that.

01:04:37.636 --> 01:04:39.619
I didn't think we had to get
the authorities involved.

01:04:39.719 --> 01:04:41.010
You broke into the Megastore?

01:04:41.135 --> 01:04:42.785
No! Come on...

01:04:42.885 --> 01:04:46.285
well, technically yes,
but it was for the purpose of good.

01:04:46.385 --> 01:04:48.844
I was undercover. I was deep cover.

01:04:48.969 --> 01:04:50.744
Wait. This is your partner?

01:04:50.844 --> 01:04:53.035
- Absolutely not, no.
- Basically, yes.

01:04:53.135 --> 01:04:56.135
Look, okay, he is stealing
from Ford's, all right?

01:04:56.260 --> 01:05:00.035
He is running a scam where
he puts crossbows in computer boxes.

01:05:00.135 --> 01:05:03.635
I mean, computers in crossbow boxes.

01:05:04.635 --> 01:05:06.452
It's very elaborate.

01:05:06.552 --> 01:05:09.744
Clinton, this is what I get for taking
pity on you at the warehouse yesterday?

01:05:09.844 --> 01:05:12.035
God damn it, he's lying through his teeth!

01:05:12.135 --> 01:05:14.035
Can't you see? I want to see his room.

01:05:14.135 --> 01:05:15.510
May I go to his room?

01:05:16.677 --> 01:05:19.969
Well, Mr. Kim, if you wouldn't mind,
could we take a look at your room?

01:05:20.094 --> 01:05:21.035
Of course.

01:05:21.135 --> 01:05:23.702
I guarantee it's just loaded
with stolen merchandise...

01:05:23.802 --> 01:05:26.410
burner phones... I don't know!

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:28.285
I'm not a criminal. Let's go find out.

01:05:28.385 --> 01:05:30.285
Okay, let's take a quick look,
if you don't mind.

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:31.844
- Yeah. Of course.
- Great.

01:05:40.385 --> 01:05:42.802
Well, I think we've bothered
these two enough for one day.

01:05:42.927 --> 01:05:44.677
Hold on.

01:05:46.969 --> 01:05:48.535
Clinton, no.

01:05:48.635 --> 01:05:50.344
It's okay. I don't mind.

01:05:59.302 --> 01:06:00.677
Don't mind if I do.

01:06:06.885 --> 01:06:08.119
Oh, what's this?

01:06:08.219 --> 01:06:11.785
These the numbers
you're running for your operation?

01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:14.135
These your... your crooked books, huh?

01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:15.869
What am I looking at?

01:06:15.969 --> 01:06:18.785
Um, no, those are the plans
for the tree house

01:06:18.885 --> 01:06:20.052
my father and I are building.

01:06:21.385 --> 01:06:22.702
"Tree house"?

01:06:22.802 --> 01:06:24.802
Yes, for my sister and all her friends.

01:06:25.802 --> 01:06:27.452
Okay. Time to go, Clinton.

01:06:27.552 --> 01:06:29.344
Gentlemen, I apologize for the intrusion.

01:06:29.469 --> 01:06:32.077
- We will be on our way now.
- No problem at all.

01:06:32.177 --> 01:06:35.535
Oh, look there. You're a Lincoln admirer?

01:06:35.635 --> 01:06:37.535
I'm a Lincoln man myself.

01:06:37.635 --> 01:06:41.952
"Leave nothing for tomorrow
which can be done today."

01:06:42.052 --> 01:06:44.410
"The demon of intemperance
ever seems to have delighted

01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:47.135
in sucking the blood of genius
and of generosity."

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:50.719
Springfield, Illinois.
February 22nd, 1842.

01:06:51.719 --> 01:06:54.844
Wow. That is very impressive.

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:57.744
- You must be very proud, Mr. Kim.
- I am.

01:06:57.844 --> 01:06:59.677
- Quite a young man.
- Thank you.

01:06:59.802 --> 01:07:01.410
- That was my high-school project.
- Yeah?

01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:03.035
Yeah, by pencil.

01:07:03.135 --> 01:07:04.844
- Oh, my... you did that?
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:04.969 --> 01:07:06.510
Wow, that is...

01:07:06.635 --> 01:07:08.135
I thought that was
one of the old photographs.

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:09.844
That's unbelievable. Unbelievable.

01:07:09.969 --> 01:07:11.260
Come on, Clinton.

01:07:21.135 --> 01:07:23.119
Clinton, I really like your mom.

01:07:23.219 --> 01:07:26.285
She's a beautiful, wonderful woman,

01:07:26.385 --> 01:07:30.344
so I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear
a couple things I heard back there.

01:07:30.469 --> 01:07:33.869
This is the second person that's
accused you of breaking and entering.

01:07:33.969 --> 01:07:36.119
We're talking multiple felonies here.

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:38.135
If it happens again, I'm hauling you in.

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.177
Got it? You're done with this.

01:07:40.302 --> 01:07:42.510
Leave it to the authorities.
And I'm not asking.

01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:49.010
You're right, Frank,
and I appreciate that.

01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:53.969
Now that we know each other better

01:07:54.094 --> 01:07:56.219
and that you're involved
with my mom and all,

01:07:58.802 --> 01:08:00.760
there's something
I think I should tell you.

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:29.843
Come on, come on.

01:08:31.135 --> 01:08:33.010
Gotcha.

01:08:35.885 --> 01:08:37.635
Bingo.

01:09:04.593 --> 01:09:06.301
- Can I help you?
- Mrs. Ford.

01:09:06.426 --> 01:09:08.743
Are you... I need to speak with Ford.

01:09:08.843 --> 01:09:11.285
Mrs. Ford is not here right now,

01:09:11.385 --> 01:09:13.843
and Mr. Ford is not well.

01:09:13.968 --> 01:09:15.868
Full disclosure... I'm a detective.

01:09:15.968 --> 01:09:17.635
I don't want to alarm you,
but you're in danger...

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.535
I'm sorry. Mr. Ford said no visitors.

01:09:20.635 --> 01:09:23.077
He's sick, not feeling well?
I'll come back.

01:09:23.176 --> 01:09:24.702
I'm sorry to bother you. I'll come...

01:09:24.801 --> 01:09:26.202
Oh, no, no, seÃ±or!

01:09:26.301 --> 01:09:29.635
- Ford?
- No! SeÃ±or, no, you...

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.801
- Ford, where are you?
- You can't go up there, seÃ±or!

01:09:33.593 --> 01:09:35.176
Ford.

01:09:35.301 --> 01:09:37.176
I have some urgent information...

01:09:37.301 --> 01:09:39.676
Oh, Mr. Ford, I'm sorry.

01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:42.135
He wouldn't listen. He just come in.

01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:44.702
Do you want me to take him out?

01:09:44.801 --> 01:09:46.243
Huh? No, no, that's fine.

01:09:46.343 --> 01:09:48.702
Can I bring you anything?

01:09:48.801 --> 01:09:51.077
- Huh? Ice cream.
- We're out of ice cream, sir.

01:09:51.176 --> 01:09:54.593
Okay, bourbon in a pint glass.
Fill it up to the brim.

01:09:55.843 --> 01:09:57.677
Uh, wh...

01:09:57.802 --> 01:09:59.968
what the hell happened to you, Ford?

01:10:00.093 --> 01:10:03.802
Jesus, you look like
some kind of transient.

01:10:03.927 --> 01:10:06.077
You ever seen "Angel and the Badman"?

01:10:06.177 --> 01:10:08.010
Uh, no, I don't think so.

01:10:08.135 --> 01:10:09.843
I've watched it four times.

01:10:11.302 --> 01:10:12.510
Today.

01:10:12.635 --> 01:10:15.952
And its meaning is becoming
more clear to me, watch this.

01:10:16.052 --> 01:10:17.910
Look. Yeah.

01:10:18.010 --> 01:10:20.743
Ford, I am here to talk to you
about your store.

01:10:20.843 --> 01:10:24.285
There is a major
theft operation going on. Now...

01:10:24.385 --> 01:10:26.618
Shh, shh, shh! Just watch this. Watch.

01:10:26.718 --> 01:10:28.868
Look. They cut to him.

01:10:28.968 --> 01:10:32.177
He does this thing
with his face... like that.

01:10:34.302 --> 01:10:35.635
Oh... wow.

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.302
Okay, look.

01:10:37.427 --> 01:10:39.118
Yi Kim is stealing from you.

01:10:39.218 --> 01:10:41.802
He's running a huge scam
right under your nose.

01:10:41.927 --> 01:10:43.718
He's the one who murdered my cat.

01:10:47.718 --> 01:10:48.843
What are... what are you...

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:52.952
You're the kid from the store.

01:10:53.052 --> 01:10:55.427
Yeah. Who'd you think I was?

01:11:01.218 --> 01:11:02.343
What's this?

01:11:02.468 --> 01:11:04.177
A fax, seÃ±or, from Mrs. Ford.

01:11:09.093 --> 01:11:11.635
And now she's afraid
to come in person, huh?

01:11:18.468 --> 01:11:21.952
Damn it! Everything?
I'm not signing this, okay?

01:11:22.052 --> 01:11:25.343
You can tell the Levinson,
Levinson, and Rothberg firm

01:11:25.468 --> 01:11:27.868
that I'll see her in hell
before I sign that!

01:11:27.968 --> 01:11:30.077
She's not taking everything from me!

01:11:30.177 --> 01:11:31.785
And where's my bourbon?

01:11:31.885 --> 01:11:34.802
Um, I... you threw it against the wall.

01:11:35.802 --> 01:11:37.802
- Is that right? Is that what I did?
- I...

01:11:37.927 --> 01:11:39.576
Huh? You got all the answers now?

01:11:39.676 --> 01:11:42.910
Huh? You think that Yi Kim
is stealing from Al Ford, is that it?

01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:46.343
Al Ford doesn't get scammed
by weirdo stock boys!

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:50.035
Product photos for resale, you see?

01:11:50.135 --> 01:11:52.368
He's stealing them
in surplus crossbow boxes

01:11:52.468 --> 01:11:55.285
and handing them off,
thousands of dollars' worth.

01:11:55.385 --> 01:11:57.176
I just don't know who the fence is.

01:11:58.926 --> 01:12:00.885
Son of a bitch.

01:12:04.385 --> 01:12:05.535
- Greta.
- What? Wait.

01:12:05.635 --> 01:12:08.118
Well, she knew, but... but she... she...

01:12:08.218 --> 01:12:10.801
actually, I don't think she knew. She's...

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:14.135
is everybody in the world
trying to fuck me?

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:16.010
Wait. Ford!

01:12:17.551 --> 01:12:20.718
Ford, what the hell are you doing?

01:12:22.176 --> 01:12:23.801
Where are you going?

01:12:23.926 --> 01:12:25.301
What are you doing?

01:12:25.426 --> 01:12:26.868
This is my battle, too.

01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:28.468
I don't give a shit.

01:12:41.593 --> 01:12:44.843
Hey. We just passed Yi's.

01:12:46.135 --> 01:12:47.868
Uh...

01:12:47.968 --> 01:12:49.843
Ford, where are we going?

01:12:58.385 --> 01:13:00.201
What the hell are we doing here?

01:13:00.301 --> 01:13:02.243
Greta! Greta!

01:13:02.343 --> 01:13:04.951
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?

01:13:05.051 --> 01:13:08.135
I know exactly what's going on!

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:12.176
Jeez... hey! What... are you deaf?

01:13:12.301 --> 01:13:14.451
Hey! You want to hurt me? Huh?

01:13:14.551 --> 01:13:17.743
Ford, I'm telling you, it's Yi!

01:13:17.843 --> 01:13:19.676
She's got nothing to do with this.

01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:23.968
Greta, I don't know!

01:13:24.093 --> 01:13:26.785
Oh! What the hell?

01:13:26.885 --> 01:13:29.076
Huh? How about that?

01:13:29.176 --> 01:13:31.510
Ford! She... aah! Stop it!

01:13:31.635 --> 01:13:34.135
I know exactly what's going on,
you crazy bitch!

01:13:35.343 --> 01:13:36.676
Ford! Oh, my...

01:13:39.218 --> 01:13:40.451
How about that?

01:13:40.551 --> 01:13:42.551
You want to hurt me? I'll hurt you!

01:13:44.968 --> 01:13:47.368
Are you insane?

01:13:47.468 --> 01:13:49.968
I got nothing to do with this.

01:13:51.635 --> 01:13:55.093
Ford, I told you, she is innocent!

01:13:56.926 --> 01:13:59.118
You idiot.

01:13:59.218 --> 01:14:01.718
She's the fence.

01:14:14.635 --> 01:14:15.843
How could you?

01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:18.968
You're the fence?

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.035
Just get out of here, Clinton.

01:14:24.135 --> 01:14:26.343
I don't ever want to see you again.

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.843
Go!

01:14:57.635 --> 01:14:59.468
Ma, not now.

01:14:59.593 --> 01:15:02.010
Okay. I just want to ask you a question.

01:15:02.135 --> 01:15:04.035
Yeah, and I would like the truth.

01:15:04.135 --> 01:15:05.951
Um, okay.

01:15:06.051 --> 01:15:09.634
Did you tell Frank that I have AIDS?

01:15:12.634 --> 01:15:14.868
Ah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:14.968 --> 01:15:16.218
Well...

01:15:17.968 --> 01:15:19.884
it was in a certain context.

01:15:20.884 --> 01:15:23.909
Mom, what... what are you doing?

01:15:24.009 --> 01:15:28.301
Hey! Hey!
Stop it! Stop... It was a joke, Ma!

01:15:28.426 --> 01:15:31.034
Hoyle obviously
has no sense of humor. Stop!

01:15:31.134 --> 01:15:33.076
Frank was right. I have spoiled you.

01:15:33.176 --> 01:15:35.243
This is for your own good!

01:15:35.343 --> 01:15:37.034
Hoyle said that?

01:15:37.134 --> 01:15:39.843
You're gonna take his side
over your own child?

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:40.968
Have you noticed that you're a grown man?

01:15:41.093 --> 01:15:42.076
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:15:42.176 --> 01:15:44.701
- You're a grown man!
- Ma, you know how much this is worth?

01:15:44.801 --> 01:15:46.743
They're worth nothing! Look at this!

01:15:46.843 --> 01:15:49.534
- Stop it!
- You've humiliated me!

01:15:49.634 --> 01:15:53.034
Ma, this is an original! Ma!

01:15:53.134 --> 01:15:55.259
Go sleep at the bus stop!

01:16:00.884 --> 01:16:02.468
Ma, I'll die out here!

01:17:20.259 --> 01:17:22.301
Ford.

01:17:22.426 --> 01:17:24.801
Ford's the fence.

01:17:27.801 --> 01:17:29.426
He's stealing from himself.

01:17:50.426 --> 01:17:53.284
Ford, I know everything.

01:17:53.384 --> 01:17:55.384
No, turn the flashlight off.

01:17:57.009 --> 01:17:58.301
Yi?

01:17:58.426 --> 01:18:00.909
Clintonio.

01:18:01.009 --> 01:18:04.701
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Yi.

01:18:04.801 --> 01:18:06.868
Did Ford do this to you?

01:18:06.968 --> 01:18:09.118
Clintonio...

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:11.509
your pocket.

01:18:14.134 --> 01:18:17.076
What the... what the hell is that?

01:18:17.176 --> 01:18:19.201
I... I don't under... I don't understa...

01:18:19.301 --> 01:18:20.301
Shh.

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:28.743
How... all right. I'm... I'm...

01:18:28.843 --> 01:18:31.134
Yi, I'm calling the police.

01:18:31.259 --> 01:18:33.343
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:18:33.468 --> 01:18:35.743
I... wait. Okay.

01:18:35.843 --> 01:18:39.201
Guys... guys, what's going on?

01:18:39.301 --> 01:18:41.451
Greta bear...

01:18:41.551 --> 01:18:44.409
Greta? Where is she?

01:18:44.509 --> 01:18:47.467
- She needs you.
- Where is she?

01:18:49.134 --> 01:18:50.784
Avignon.

01:18:50.884 --> 01:18:53.201
Avignon. The bar.

01:18:53.301 --> 01:18:56.034
The bar. She's at the bar. Okay.

01:18:56.134 --> 01:18:58.884
All right, he's gonna be okay.
Just call the police.

01:19:06.467 --> 01:19:08.801
Ford?

01:19:16.634 --> 01:19:18.509
Yeah, come on out.

01:19:21.342 --> 01:19:23.759
You had to have everything, huh?

01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:26.509
You put up your Megastore
in our little town

01:19:26.634 --> 01:19:30.967
and run out all the small businesses,
including mine.

01:19:31.092 --> 01:19:33.951
And you turned a massive profit.

01:19:34.051 --> 01:19:36.801
But that wasn't enough for you.

01:19:38.217 --> 01:19:40.842
The palace, the fast cars.

01:19:42.217 --> 01:19:45.592
No, you needed another chandelier
for your chandelier.

01:19:46.842 --> 01:19:48.701
So what did you do?

01:19:48.801 --> 01:19:51.034
You ran a scam from the inside.

01:19:51.134 --> 01:19:54.784
And you were sitting pretty
until your assistant manager

01:19:54.884 --> 01:19:57.867
caught wind of it and quit on you.

01:19:57.967 --> 01:20:00.592
And then what'd you do?
You had to shut her up, right?

01:20:01.842 --> 01:20:06.467
You killed her beloved cat
with an untraceable crossbow.

01:20:06.592 --> 01:20:10.134
You sick bastard.

01:20:11.717 --> 01:20:14.634
But you didn't count on that cat
having another owner, did you?

01:20:15.967 --> 01:20:17.217
A pinhead.

01:20:18.301 --> 01:20:19.951
A loser.

01:20:20.051 --> 01:20:22.301
A guy out for the truth.

01:20:22.426 --> 01:20:24.909
Well, you want the truth now, Ford?

01:20:25.009 --> 01:20:27.134
You're the loser.

01:20:27.259 --> 01:20:30.634
"America's family store"? Pathetic.

01:20:32.509 --> 01:20:35.242
I may be a loser,

01:20:35.342 --> 01:20:36.759
but at least I'm not a phony.

01:20:40.467 --> 01:20:42.451
It's all over, Ford.

01:20:42.551 --> 01:20:44.759
I got all the evidence right here.

01:20:49.634 --> 01:20:51.134
Are you...

01:20:51.259 --> 01:20:53.784
are you crying?

01:20:53.884 --> 01:20:55.634
I'm broke.

01:20:58.467 --> 01:20:59.634
I got nothing.

01:21:01.009 --> 01:21:04.842
The store has been in the red for months.

01:21:07.134 --> 01:21:09.301
Ford's Megastore?

01:21:09.426 --> 01:21:12.342
My wife, she took everything.

01:21:13.967 --> 01:21:15.967
I am a phony, kid.

01:21:17.676 --> 01:21:19.576
You're right about that.

01:21:19.676 --> 01:21:22.342
My whole life's been an act.

01:21:25.676 --> 01:21:28.967
I played Biff in the Ohio State production

01:21:29.092 --> 01:21:31.634
of "Death of a Salesman."

01:21:34.384 --> 01:21:37.801
The "Lantern" said it
was an inspired performance.

01:21:41.634 --> 01:21:42.759
Theater...

01:21:45.592 --> 01:21:47.051
that was my dream.

01:21:50.509 --> 01:21:53.201
I... one year, I had...

01:21:53.301 --> 01:21:55.284
I had head shots made up. Look at this.

01:21:55.384 --> 01:21:56.926
Right here.

01:22:02.509 --> 01:22:04.701
I brought them home.

01:22:04.801 --> 01:22:08.034
My dad looked at them, and he just...

01:22:08.134 --> 01:22:10.967
he just started laughing.

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:13.509
He thought I was joking.

01:22:16.925 --> 01:22:21.300
And I was so embarrassed
that I didn't know what to do.

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.634
So I just...

01:22:24.759 --> 01:22:26.967
I just laughed along with him, you know?

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:35.550
The irony is, I got stuck
with one role for a lifetime...

01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:37.925
of...

01:22:40.967 --> 01:22:42.675
Al Ford.

01:22:44.217 --> 01:22:46.950
And I finally had this...

01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:49.800
one last chance at happiness.

01:22:49.925 --> 01:22:51.925
And...

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.175
she's in love with somebody else.

01:23:07.675 --> 01:23:09.634
Who are you talking about?

01:23:17.675 --> 01:23:20.634
- Greta.
- Greta?

01:23:22.925 --> 01:23:24.884
What?

01:23:29.884 --> 01:23:32.925
You... and the...

01:23:33.425 --> 01:23:34.634
Oh...

01:23:39.967 --> 01:23:41.467
Greta?

01:23:42.967 --> 01:23:43.967
Hey!

01:24:32.259 --> 01:24:34.550
Greta? Hey!

01:25:35.509 --> 01:25:37.009
Clinton?

01:25:37.134 --> 01:25:39.008
Greta.

01:25:39.133 --> 01:25:41.033
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

01:25:41.133 --> 01:25:44.842
I think so.

01:25:44.967 --> 01:25:47.133
- Oh, God. Greta.
- Oh, God.

01:25:51.633 --> 01:25:53.467
Don't move.

01:25:53.592 --> 01:25:55.508
- Hey!
- Don't do it, Al.

01:25:55.633 --> 01:25:57.092
Shut up.

01:25:58.717 --> 01:26:00.008
It was you.

01:26:00.133 --> 01:26:03.133
You loved that cat more than you loved me.

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:10.133
Come on, Greta.

01:26:10.258 --> 01:26:12.633
This... this is crazy.

01:26:12.758 --> 01:26:15.842
Look, let's forget about all this.

01:26:15.967 --> 01:26:18.075
Let's get out of here, to Brussels.

01:26:18.175 --> 01:26:20.283
We can go, like we talked about.

01:26:20.383 --> 01:26:22.617
Walks in the Sonian Forest?

01:26:22.717 --> 01:26:25.633
You want me to run away with you?

01:26:25.758 --> 01:26:27.533
You need help, Al.

01:26:27.633 --> 01:26:29.117
I need you!

01:26:29.217 --> 01:26:31.342
You killed my cat!

01:26:31.467 --> 01:26:34.408
Ah, God, the cat. The cat!

01:26:34.508 --> 01:26:36.700
The goddamn cat was a mistake. Move!

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.883
Just put it down, Al.

01:26:41.425 --> 01:26:43.467
Please get out of the way.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.033
You've hurt her enough.

01:26:47.133 --> 01:26:50.033
I'm not gonna let you do it.

01:26:50.133 --> 01:26:52.300
I'm not moving.

01:26:52.425 --> 01:26:54.867
If you want to shoot somebody,

01:26:54.967 --> 01:26:57.592
you got to shoot me, God damn it.

01:26:59.467 --> 01:27:00.617
Agh!

01:27:00.717 --> 01:27:02.133
Oh, my God!

01:27:02.258 --> 01:27:04.758
He actually sh... shot me.

01:27:11.425 --> 01:27:13.300
I got you.

01:27:13.425 --> 01:27:16.633
Oh, my God, it's...
yeah, it's starting to hurt.

01:27:18.467 --> 01:27:19.508
Agh!

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:24.117
Stop! Enough! Please!

01:27:24.217 --> 01:27:26.258
I don't think I can handle another one.

01:27:35.342 --> 01:27:37.133
Greta...

01:27:41.383 --> 01:27:42.508
Oh, Greta!

01:27:45.175 --> 01:27:47.967
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:27:50.967 --> 01:27:52.842
It's okay. It's okay.

01:28:11.383 --> 01:28:12.883
Al!

01:28:15.217 --> 01:28:16.967
Al!

01:28:17.092 --> 01:28:20.117
Al! Wait!

01:28:20.217 --> 01:28:21.967
Don't do it.

01:28:24.342 --> 01:28:26.867
No. No, no, don't, don't!

01:28:26.967 --> 01:28:30.342
It's not worth it! Don't do it!

01:28:30.467 --> 01:28:34.008
Plus, I don't even think
it'll actually work.

01:28:37.717 --> 01:28:40.592
You'll probably just end up deformed.

01:28:45.758 --> 01:28:46.967
I got nothing.

01:28:52.967 --> 01:28:55.425
Al Ford doesn't.

01:28:58.133 --> 01:29:00.050
But maybe you do.

01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:48.008
Greta...

01:29:49.133 --> 01:29:50.425
Greta...

01:29:52.133 --> 01:29:53.341
we did it.

01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:00.550
- We did it.
- Okay.

01:30:01.925 --> 01:30:03.800
We did it.

01:30:19.425 --> 01:30:21.175
God?

01:30:22.633 --> 01:30:24.841
God?

01:30:26.466 --> 01:30:27.758
Sucks.

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:33.741
Do me a favor, kid.

01:30:33.841 --> 01:30:36.116
Take care of my ma.

01:30:36.216 --> 01:30:37.783
I'm not gonna make it.

01:30:37.883 --> 01:30:39.800
It's just a flesh wound, Clinton.

01:30:39.925 --> 01:30:42.341
Well, two flesh wounds.
You're gonna be fine, bud.

01:30:43.925 --> 01:30:46.216
I found this.

01:30:48.341 --> 01:30:51.216
Ah. Keep it.

01:30:52.341 --> 01:30:54.008
It's yours now.

01:30:59.258 --> 01:31:01.133
Hoyle?

01:31:01.258 --> 01:31:03.300
I'll give this collar to you.

01:31:03.425 --> 01:31:05.116
Shut up, Clinton.

01:31:05.216 --> 01:31:07.341
Let's get this guy to the hospital.
Come on.

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:32.925
Hey.

01:31:34.050 --> 01:31:35.800
I know you.

01:31:35.925 --> 01:31:38.241
You're Al Ford,
the guy in that commercial.

01:31:38.341 --> 01:31:39.966
Nah.

01:31:46.883 --> 01:31:48.008
Not anymore.

01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:57.866
Hey, let me get that for you.

01:31:57.966 --> 01:31:59.633
Thank you.

01:31:59.758 --> 01:32:01.950
Sure.

01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:05.116
You know, I've kind of
always wanted a limp.

01:32:05.216 --> 01:32:07.908
Well, take it easy, there, Duke.

01:32:08.008 --> 01:32:10.466
You're just jealous
because I'm a better detective.

01:32:11.466 --> 01:32:14.883
You kids ready? Come on, shake a leg.

01:32:23.341 --> 01:32:27.008
And we're off
in a cloud of nuts and bolts.

01:32:38.174 --> 01:32:39.466
Can we make a quick stop?

01:32:59.924 --> 01:33:01.883
Hi. Hi.

01:33:02.883 --> 01:33:04.883
Huh?

01:33:06.174 --> 01:33:09.633
Hey, little guy. What's your name?

01:33:13.216 --> 01:33:15.174
I'm Bartleby.

01:33:17.133 --> 01:33:19.199
Bartleby.

01:33:19.299 --> 01:33:23.133
So, how's it going, Bartleby?

01:33:23.258 --> 01:33:27.033
Well, you know, same old, same old.

01:33:27.133 --> 01:33:29.783
Life behind bars is rough, but...

01:33:29.883 --> 01:33:32.341
I should be up for parole soon.

01:33:34.341 --> 01:33:36.508
That's great news, Bart.

01:33:38.133 --> 01:33:40.799
So, uh...

01:33:40.924 --> 01:33:42.966
I know I just met you, but...

01:33:44.091 --> 01:33:46.341
I kind of miss you, Bart.

01:33:49.591 --> 01:33:50.674
Ditto.

01:33:53.341 --> 01:33:55.466
Was that you or Bartleby talking?

01:34:05.008 --> 01:34:06.508
So what are you doing here?

01:34:06.633 --> 01:34:09.741
New job. I'm the head groomer.

01:34:09.841 --> 01:34:11.533
Oh, really?

01:34:11.633 --> 01:34:16.258
Yeah, cutting human hair
just felt too easy, you know?

01:34:17.258 --> 01:34:19.924
Cutting fur, that's an art, right?

01:34:21.674 --> 01:34:23.841
Is that your mom with Hoyle?

01:34:23.966 --> 01:34:26.841
Yeah. Yeah. Can you believe that?

01:34:28.341 --> 01:34:32.116
They're, uh, actually helping me
move into my new place.

01:34:32.216 --> 01:34:34.966
That's so great.
You're moving up in the world.

01:34:40.008 --> 01:34:41.966
I got a new ride.

01:34:45.383 --> 01:34:46.841
Cool.

01:34:49.049 --> 01:34:50.508
Um...

01:34:54.008 --> 01:34:55.674
Well...

01:34:57.758 --> 01:34:59.674
it was nice seeing you again.

01:35:03.966 --> 01:35:05.799
Hey, do you want to take a ride?

01:35:07.133 --> 01:35:09.049
Don't you have to, um...

01:35:11.008 --> 01:35:13.199
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

01:35:13.299 --> 01:35:16.383
And you're moving, so...

01:35:23.466 --> 01:35:25.466
Which I think he needs.

01:35:26.466 --> 01:35:28.033
Clinton?

01:35:28.133 --> 01:35:29.841
Son of a bitch.

01:35:31.466 --> 01:35:32.924
Attaboy.
