WEBVTT

00:01.099 --> 00:03.670
<i>Previously on Hell's Kitchen.</i>

00:03.671 --> 00:05.005
I have you and
I have nobody else.

00:05.006 --> 00:07.407
Dana and Christina
solidified their alliance

00:07.408 --> 00:09.543
against Kimmie, Robyn,
and Tiffany.

00:09.544 --> 00:11.111
They're not gonna break us.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.479
On the blue team...

00:12.480 --> 00:13.780
I don't feel
that you're leading.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.782
Royce blamed Patrick...

00:15.783 --> 00:18.418
This team has gotten better
and stronger because of me.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.387
For the team's poor performance.

00:20.388 --> 00:23.323
He's an old man,
he needs to go home.

00:23.324 --> 00:26.226
At the first ever
fashion show dinner,

00:26.227 --> 00:27.427
the blue kitchen...

00:27.428 --> 00:29.029
Stop! What
are you doing?

00:29.030 --> 00:30.430
Damn it.
Damn it.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.064
Got no style points.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.467
I've got to start
the next show.

00:33.468 --> 00:34.468
<i>Clemenza!</i>

00:34.469 --> 00:35.469
Salt!

00:35.470 --> 00:37.003
I'm running out of time.

00:37.004 --> 00:38.105
In the red kitchen...

00:38.106 --> 00:39.506
What do you guys need
over here?

00:39.507 --> 00:41.007
Even though
Christina and Robyn...

00:41.008 --> 00:42.175
I'm looking at her like,

00:42.176 --> 00:43.410
"seriously, I don't
need your help right now."

00:43.411 --> 00:44.811
Didn't see eye to eye.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.513
I've got to...
set it down, I got it.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.315
She has, like,
this big ego thing,

00:48.316 --> 00:49.750
where she doesn't want
any help.

00:49.751 --> 00:51.351
Please, just
back the up.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.419
But that
didn't slow them down.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.687
<i>Service, please.</i>

00:53.688 --> 00:55.255
We are under control.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.823
The red team had
a successful dinner service.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.525
Clear down!

00:58.526 --> 01:00.060
It was a different
story in the blue kitchen.

01:00.061 --> 01:01.094
Everything's cold.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.708
As the men...
Put your hand on there.

01:02.709 --> 01:04.209
Limped to the finish line.

01:04.211 --> 01:05.275
We're making
rookie mistakes.

01:05.275 --> 01:06.610
Could I have the beef hot?

01:07.401 --> 01:09.136
Congratulations, red team.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.971
Yay!

01:10.972 --> 01:12.405
The blue team nominated...

01:12.406 --> 01:13.440
Clemenza.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.542
And...
Guy.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.611
And although chef
Ramsay asked for everyone's input,

01:17.612 --> 01:18.545
Who should be
going home tonight?

01:18.546 --> 01:19.112
Clemenza, chef.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.348
Clemenza.

01:21.349 --> 01:22.783
Everybody's trying
to get rid of me,

01:22.784 --> 01:24.484
but you know what?

01:24.485 --> 01:25.786
I still put out better food
than everybody standing there.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.122
He decided to send home...

01:29.123 --> 01:30.757
Guy, give me your jacket.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.592
Thus ending Guy's dream

01:32.593 --> 01:34.461
of becoming head chef
at Gordon Ramsay Steak

01:34.462 --> 01:36.196
at Paris, Las Vegas.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.360
Piss off.

02:42.864 --> 02:44.865
I guess I don't have any friends
on the blue team,

02:44.866 --> 02:45.932
and you know what?

02:45.933 --> 02:47.467
It's all good,

02:47.468 --> 02:48.668
'cause I'm not here
to make friends.

02:48.669 --> 02:49.803
I'm here to win.

02:50.805 --> 02:52.405
Hey, you know what?
I want to...

02:52.406 --> 02:54.941
I want you to hear something.
I'm gonna be honest with you,

02:54.942 --> 02:56.309
I have never doubted here,
I've told you that.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.911
I'm trying to play it safe
for now,

02:57.912 --> 02:59.980
but I got no use for him,

02:59.981 --> 03:02.349
and I'm gonna get rid of
Clemenza as soon as I can.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.417
I'm glad you're here, dude.
There is no doubt...

03:04.418 --> 03:06.620
I said it today, you
cook, dude, all right?

03:06.621 --> 03:08.822
Patrick, I know,
is just a kiss

03:08.823 --> 03:10.590
And I knew
he was gonna vote me,

03:10.591 --> 03:12.058
'cause he's voted me
twice now in a row.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.426
And you know what?
I didn't come here

03:13.427 --> 03:14.728
for you to pat me on the back,

03:14.729 --> 03:16.496
or for all the hum-a-na,
hum-a-na.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.298
But I'll love him all day long
until I win.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.834
Slimy crap.

03:20.835 --> 03:24.170
After a tense evening,
everyone crashes for the night,

03:25.439 --> 03:29.910
But Clemenza is wide awake.

03:29.911 --> 03:31.044
And come morning time...

03:31.045 --> 03:32.679
Let's go.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.648
He's anxious
to prove to chef Ramsay

03:34.649 --> 03:37.284
that it was a wise decision
to keep him around.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.585
Okay, good morning.

03:38.586 --> 03:39.853
Good morning, chef.

03:39.854 --> 03:41.521
Clemenza, ready to fight back?

03:41.522 --> 03:43.056
<i>I'm ready to go, chef.
Good.</i>

03:43.057 --> 03:45.592
<i>For today's challenge,
you are gonna be tested</i>

03:45.593 --> 03:47.260
on your ability to adapt.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.995
<i>On the counters
in front of you,</i>

03:48.996 --> 03:51.431
<i>clearly, there are four domes.</i>

03:51.432 --> 03:52.899
When the challenge begins,

03:52.900 --> 03:55.602
<i>the first dome
will be revealed.</i>

03:55.603 --> 03:58.004
The first dome
will have six proteins.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.639
Each of you
will grab a protein.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.708
From then on, every few minutes

04:01.709 --> 04:03.410
you will hear me ring a bell,

04:03.411 --> 04:06.680
<i>and the next dome
will be revealed.</i>

04:06.681 --> 04:09.449
<i>Select the ingredient that
goes best with your protein.</i>

04:09.450 --> 04:10.550
Everybody understand?

04:10.551 --> 04:11.885
Yes, chef.

04:11.886 --> 04:13.486
This is not gonna be good.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.821
There's no telling
what is under this dome.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.456
<i>Your 30 minutes starts...</i>

04:16.457 --> 04:17.524
Now.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.059
Off you go.

04:19.060 --> 04:20.493
For today's
adaptability challenge...

04:20.494 --> 04:21.226
What is there?

04:21.228 --> 04:22.295
We got veal, pork, Turkey.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.297
I'll take monkfish.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.633
The chefs must incorporate
the four rounds of ingredients

04:26.634 --> 04:28.668
that are revealed
in five-minute intervals.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.070
<i>You got the chicken?
Turkey breast.</i>

04:30.071 --> 04:31.404
Veal chop.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.872
<i>Did you get what you want, Kim?
No.</i>

04:32.873 --> 04:34.207
Turkey breast?

04:34.208 --> 04:35.375
I don't even know
what to do with that.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.979
This Guinea hen
is gonna be amazing.

04:38.980 --> 04:40.547
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

04:40.548 --> 04:41.715
Justin, happy
with the monkfish?

04:41.716 --> 04:42.582
Yes, chef.

04:42.583 --> 04:43.750
Good.

04:43.751 --> 04:44.985
I want to see you
think on your feet.

04:45.987 --> 04:47.420
Let's go.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.322
As the second
dome is revealed...

04:49.323 --> 04:50.957
<i>Now you've got your starch.</i>

04:50.958 --> 04:52.792
The chefs must
collaborate on the ingredients,

04:52.793 --> 04:55.662
so that everyone is capable
of producing a great dish.

04:55.663 --> 04:56.896
I'll take the lasagna.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.064
The celeriac, please?

04:58.065 --> 04:59.632
I'm taking it.
I'm taking it.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.634
First come, first served,
bitches!

05:01.635 --> 05:03.636
When it's a challenge
like this,

05:03.637 --> 05:05.338
it's important
to focus on yourself.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.474
I want chef Ramsay
to see me shine.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.409
I need potatoes, man.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.244
<i>Guys, we probably should
be talking a little bit more.</i>

05:11.245 --> 05:12.345
About what?

05:12.346 --> 05:13.613
About who's taking what.

05:16.217 --> 05:17.884
That's adventurous, Justin.
I hope it works.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.352
Me too, chef.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.388
I started making a ravioli
with lasagna sheets,

05:21.389 --> 05:23.556
using monkfish mousse
inside the ravioli.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.025
It's a ballsy move,
but sometimes

05:25.026 --> 05:26.826
you gotta just go for it.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.062
While Justin
is confident in his pasta,

05:29.063 --> 05:30.597
over in the red kitchen...

05:30.598 --> 05:32.165
This is not good.

05:32.166 --> 05:32.966
Kimmie is anything but.

05:33.968 --> 05:35.402
Lasagna?

05:35.403 --> 05:37.137
Like, what the
am I gonna do with this ?

05:37.138 --> 05:39.439
Turkey and lasagna?
Like,

05:39.440 --> 05:42.108
There's no way,
I'm not Italian.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.210
I'm trying to fight
for my ingredients,

05:44.211 --> 05:46.212
but nobody wants to
talk about what I want.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.680
you, then.
I'm gonna get my .

05:49.116 --> 05:50.984
Move the out of the way.
Don't push.

05:50.985 --> 05:52.352
With the third dome revealed,

05:52.353 --> 05:54.854
the chefs race to claim
a vegetable for their dishes.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.956
Eggplant.
Ow, all right.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.925
Bok choy, we got
beets, we got carrots

05:58.926 --> 06:00.126
Who's got the beets?

06:00.127 --> 06:01.728
<i>I do, chef.</i>

06:01.729 --> 06:03.863
Make sure every ingredient
you've slated, you use.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.598
I don't like beets.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.100
They're too earthy for me.

06:07.101 --> 06:08.635
They taste like dirt
in my mouth.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.136
But you know what?
That's my challenge,

06:10.137 --> 06:11.771
trying to figure out
the best way

06:11.772 --> 06:13.339
to incorporate
all those ingredients.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.374
Let's go, guys.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.809
One more dome to go.

06:17.711 --> 06:18.711
Go get it.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.481
Everybody runs up
to the fourth dome

06:21.482 --> 06:23.116
and there's a wild card dome.

06:23.117 --> 06:24.984
Marscapone.
I got nuts.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.653
The blue team's happy
with getting the ingredients

06:26.654 --> 06:27.587
that they're getting.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.388
I got parm.
I'll do marscapone.

06:28.389 --> 06:29.556
I got parm.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.424
And I look over and I see
the red team

06:31.425 --> 06:32.926
and it's pretty much
every woman for themselves.

06:32.927 --> 06:34.260
What's wrong with them?

06:34.261 --> 06:35.762
Shrimp and quail eggs.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.197
I'm gonna take quail eggs.

06:37.198 --> 06:38.731
Tiffany, did you want them?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.266
Uh, not really, but I can make
it work, chef.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.634
Love the attitude.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.236
I guess I'll have to
make shrimp work, too.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.338
Last two minutes, guys.

06:45.339 --> 06:46.673
Coming down, coming down,

06:46.674 --> 06:47.841
Stop waiting.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.075
Behind you!
Coming in, coming in.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.377
I just took a bite
of that lobster,

06:51.378 --> 06:53.313
and it was delicious.

06:53.314 --> 06:55.849
You know, I feel great.
I'm confident in my dish.

06:55.850 --> 06:58.551
Three, two, one..

06:58.552 --> 07:00.453
And serve.

07:00.454 --> 07:04.257
Okay, I've got some
uniquely talented judges,

07:04.258 --> 07:06.392
and they've all
earned Michelin Stars.

07:06.393 --> 07:07.627
Wow.
Wow.

07:09.130 --> 07:10.830
Please welcome our first judge.

07:10.831 --> 07:13.133
From New York,
executive chef of Annisa,

07:13.134 --> 07:14.634
<i>Anita Lo.</i>

07:15.903 --> 07:17.570
Anita Lo comes out!

07:17.571 --> 07:21.574
Oh, my goodness, she's one of
my female chef idols.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.209
Please welcome executive chef

07:23.210 --> 07:25.145
of San Francisco's
Cyrus Restaurant,

07:25.146 --> 07:26.146
Douglas Keane.

07:28.349 --> 07:30.150
Douglas, thank you
so much for coming.

07:30.151 --> 07:30.717
Great to be here.
Absolute pleasure.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.085
Thanks.

07:32.086 --> 07:33.887
Our next chef is

07:39.026 --> 07:41.394
I'm not a type of person
that gets really star-struck

07:41.395 --> 07:44.330
but to be standing in the honor
of Michelin-starred chefs

07:44.331 --> 07:46.266
is an amazing thing.

07:46.267 --> 07:48.001
Here's how
our judging's gonna work:

07:48.002 --> 07:49.936
Each of our three
Michelin Star chefs

07:49.937 --> 07:52.205
will award each dish,

07:52.206 --> 07:54.774
minimum one,
maximum three stars.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.043
Clearly, the team with
the most number of stars

07:57.044 --> 07:58.711
will win this challenge.

07:58.712 --> 08:02.115
First up, let's go with
the monkfish, please.

08:02.116 --> 08:03.783
I'm feeling confident
in my dish.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.451
It's classical,
it's traditional,

08:05.452 --> 08:07.420
and I'm thinking, "you know,

08:07.421 --> 08:09.322
maybe these judges
will like it."

08:09.323 --> 08:12.325
I have a tarragon couscous
with brown butter sauce,

08:12.326 --> 08:13.893
seasoned monkfish.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.429
Then I got quail eggs,
but just kind of made it work.

08:16.430 --> 08:17.430
It was delicious.

08:17.431 --> 08:18.665
Well-seasoned.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.200
And you cooked
the fish perfectly.

08:20.201 --> 08:21.401
<i>The quail egg,
while it might have</i>

08:21.402 --> 08:22.702
seemed like a
curve ball at first,

08:22.703 --> 08:23.870
you definitely incorporated
it into the dish

08:23.871 --> 08:24.871
and it's really quite good.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.439
Judges.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.774
<i>Way to start off, tiff.</i>

08:27.775 --> 08:28.808
<i>Great start.</i>

08:28.809 --> 08:29.809
<i>Six stars.</i>

08:29.810 --> 08:31.311
Yeah, boy!

08:31.312 --> 08:33.580
I am creative, so yay.

08:33.581 --> 08:34.746
Justin, please.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.216
Chef, I have
a five-spice

08:36.217 --> 08:37.683
roasted monkfish
and chive ravioli,

08:37.684 --> 08:41.554
a poached quail egg,
and some heirloom tomato salad.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.756
So ravioli, dangerous.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.625
Yeah, it's very dangerous, chef,
but you said, "adapt,"

08:45.626 --> 08:46.859
<i>so I went with the ravioli.</i>

08:46.860 --> 08:48.628
Michael, how was that for you?

08:48.629 --> 08:50.330
The ravioli is actually, uh,
is pretty good.

08:50.331 --> 08:51.864
Thank you very much, chef.

08:51.865 --> 08:52.966
Yeah, I'm very
impressed with it.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.067
It looked beautiful.

08:54.068 --> 08:55.568
I'm surprised, but
it actually worked.

08:55.569 --> 08:56.603
Stars, please.

08:56.604 --> 08:57.570
I'll give a two again.

08:57.571 --> 08:58.838
Two.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.306
<i>Wow, well, it's good stars.</i>

09:00.307 --> 09:01.441
Thank you very much.

09:01.442 --> 09:03.176
<i>Red team six, blue team six.</i>

09:03.177 --> 09:04.477
Next up, the battle
of the hen, please.

09:04.478 --> 09:05.912
Let's go Clemenza.
Come on, buddy.

09:05.913 --> 09:08.281
Barbie!

09:08.282 --> 09:10.149
Barbie, why don't you explain
your dish first, please.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.352
I did
a pan-roasted hen

09:12.353 --> 09:15.521
and I wound up with shrimp,
so I decided to make a hash

09:15.522 --> 09:17.056
<i>out of the potatoes
and the shrimp.</i>

09:17.057 --> 09:17.991
Does it float your boat?

09:20.928 --> 09:22.695
It's tasty.
Everything's seasoned well.

09:24.198 --> 09:26.733
Anita Lo said my dish was tasty!

09:26.734 --> 09:28.034
It's a good dish.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.302
Marks, please.

09:29.303 --> 09:30.503
<i>Wow.</i>

09:30.504 --> 09:31.671
Brilliant.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.673
It's tough.
I'm gonna give it one.

09:33.674 --> 09:34.874
<i>Five.</i>

09:34.875 --> 09:36.209
<i>Okay, great.
Uh,</i>

09:36.210 --> 09:37.543
Clemenza, please.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.145
We got a herb-roasted
guinea hen,

09:39.146 --> 09:41.047
<i>marinated grilled zucchini
with some balsamic,</i>

09:41.048 --> 09:43.549
and then I did some saffron
and herb-roasted potatoes.

09:43.550 --> 09:44.550
I love this guy.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.387
The last thing I expected was

09:47.388 --> 09:49.355
<i>to see something that elegant
and well-presented.</i>

09:49.356 --> 09:50.990
Big man with dainty fingers.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.992
These hands
can do some wonders, man.

09:54.528 --> 09:56.462
I don't know
if I want to hear that.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.731
Um, does it taste
as good as it looks?

09:58.732 --> 10:00.233
It looks great.

10:00.234 --> 10:02.468
I found some of the spice
a little overpowering.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.170
A little more restraint
with the heat,

10:04.171 --> 10:05.571
I think it would have
been right on.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.006
Michael, same thoughts, or...?

10:07.007 --> 10:08.808
Yeah, it was executed well,

10:08.809 --> 10:09.742
<i>but a little heavy-handed
with the spice.</i>

10:09.743 --> 10:10.476
Please, Anita,

10:10.477 --> 10:11.711
<i>what would you give that?</i>

10:11.712 --> 10:12.779
<i>Two, two, brilliant.</i>

10:12.780 --> 10:14.747
Sorry, Clemenza.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.215
Dang, I get the one star.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.084
I'm shocked, chef Michael,

10:18.085 --> 10:20.320
but, uh, day goes on, man.
You know, the day goes on.

10:20.321 --> 10:22.955
Next up, turkey breast.
Let's go.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.957
With the score tied at 11,

10:24.958 --> 10:27.060
Roshni looks to take the lead
from the blue team

10:27.061 --> 10:28.728
with her turkey dish.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.630
In front of you, chefs,
you have herb-stuffed roulade,

10:30.631 --> 10:32.799
on the bottom, you have
a celeriac and carrot slaw.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.067
However,

10:34.068 --> 10:35.968
The turkey's a little dry.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.970
She comes up a little short...

10:37.971 --> 10:40.206
Three stars.
What a shame.

10:40.207 --> 10:43.609
Leaving an opening for
Kimmie's cajun turkey breast pasta.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.645
Just a little
under-seasoned.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.847
You should have taken
some of his spice.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.350
Neither chef is
able to impress the judges.

10:50.351 --> 10:51.417
<i>Three stars.</i>

10:51.418 --> 10:53.319
Kimmie, ouch.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.422
And the score remains
tied heading into round four.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.324
Veal chop.
Let's go.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.194
Now Dana hopes to
help the red team pull ahead

11:01.195 --> 11:03.296
with her lemon/herb veal chop.

11:03.297 --> 11:05.064
It was great... everything
on the dish works.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.599
Yeah, I think this
was very successful.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.967
<i>Yes.
Wow.</i>

11:07.968 --> 11:09.469
With the women up by six,

11:09.470 --> 11:11.738
the pressure
now shifts to Brian,

11:11.739 --> 11:14.674
who seems confident
in his ethnic fusion veal chop.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.743
<i>Buongiorno, buenos dias, hello.</i>

11:17.945 --> 11:19.512
Wow, multilingual.

11:19.513 --> 11:20.580
Oh, God.

11:20.581 --> 11:21.948
Oh, .

11:21.949 --> 11:23.983
Brian just doesn't think
before he speaks.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.451
It's embarrassing.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.953
Just shut up.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.992
The veal chop's cooked nice.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.093
<i>Cooked perfect.</i>

11:34.094 --> 11:35.361
That's a good dish.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.929
Anita, how was that for you?

11:36.930 --> 11:38.731
<i>Excellent.</i>

11:38.732 --> 11:41.601
With two strong dishes,
the score is tied once again...

11:41.602 --> 11:44.437
Still yet to see
a three-star dish.

11:44.438 --> 11:46.439
Pork tenderloin, let's go

11:46.440 --> 11:48.841
And Patrick and
Robyn are ready to do battle.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.443
<i>Come on, Robyn.</i>

11:50.444 --> 11:51.844
Were there any ingredients
that you didn't want?

11:51.845 --> 11:52.578
I hate cooking beets.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.813
<i>Sorry?
I hate beets.</i>

11:53.814 --> 11:55.815
I see those words,

11:55.816 --> 11:58.184
"I hate beets"
leaving her mouth.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.787
And I just want to pick 'em up
and shove 'em down her throat

12:00.788 --> 12:01.788
for her.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.089
You hate beets.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.891
<i>I certainly wouldn't
present myself</i>

12:04.892 --> 12:06.292
<i>in front of three
esteemed judges</i>

12:06.293 --> 12:07.527
and tell them I hate something
and I had to cook with it.

12:07.528 --> 12:09.128
I'm sorry about that, judges.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.464
I could have more love
to the beets.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.468
I can see the looks
on the judges' faces,

12:15.469 --> 12:17.703
she's completely
turned them off.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.505
I can see that you
don't like beets.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.274
It just didn't work for me,
I'm sorry.

12:21.275 --> 12:22.408
The whole thing's
just kind of nondescript.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.376
Not surprising.

12:23.377 --> 12:25.044
Three stars.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.213
Robyn's failure
to adapt has given Patrick

12:27.214 --> 12:29.515
an opportunity
to give his team the lead

12:29.516 --> 12:31.584
with his spiced rubbed
pork tenderloin.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.019
Did you want those ingredients?

12:33.020 --> 12:34.420
I love those ingredients,

12:34.421 --> 12:36.556
<i>and I was extremely happy
to get 'em all.</i>

12:36.557 --> 12:38.024
Actually,
I would eat more of it.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.125
I really like the sauce.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.060
Bravo on cooking the pork.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.095
Patrick's strong
performance has given the blue team

12:43.096 --> 12:45.932
a three-point lead
heading into the final round.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.835
Battle of the lobster, please.
Let's go.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.170
And now Royce
has a great opportunity

12:51.171 --> 12:53.539
to clinch the victory
for his team.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.608
I feel great,
I'm confident in myself,

12:55.609 --> 12:57.777
and I know the judges
are gonna like my dish.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.646
I did a whole poached lobster
in saffron and thyme.

13:02.316 --> 13:03.316
<i>What is that?</i>

13:03.317 --> 13:04.517
Hair.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.152
Ohh.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.288
It's a long one.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.490
Oh.
Oh, my God.

13:10.491 --> 13:12.024
Oh, God.

13:20.151 --> 13:22.586
It's the final
round of the challenge

13:22.587 --> 13:24.221
where the chefs were forced
to think fast on their feet.

13:24.222 --> 13:27.991
The blue team is ahead
by three stars and has a chance

13:27.992 --> 13:29.693
to clinch the victory
with Royce's lobster,

13:29.694 --> 13:31.695
but one judge has found

13:31.696 --> 13:35.098
an undesirable
extra ingredient in his dish.

13:35.099 --> 13:36.833
Hair.

13:36.834 --> 13:37.934
It's a long one.

13:37.935 --> 13:39.302
Oh.
Oh, my God,

13:39.303 --> 13:40.504
oh, God.

13:41.673 --> 13:43.774
God, you've gotta be
kidding me, man.

13:43.775 --> 13:46.076
You give a chef who give a chef
who has two Michelin Stars

13:46.077 --> 13:47.644
a plate with
a piece of hair on it.

13:47.645 --> 13:49.112
That's gross.
It's not curly,

13:49.113 --> 13:51.181
so I'm pretty happy about that.

13:51.182 --> 13:52.749
Was a hair
doing in there?

13:52.750 --> 13:54.451
I don't know.

13:54.452 --> 13:56.620
Look at the length
of that thing.

13:56.621 --> 13:58.355
It's bigger than Roshni.

13:58.356 --> 14:00.157
I don't know
how there ended up being

14:00.158 --> 14:02.259
a 12-inch piece of hair
on my dish.

14:02.260 --> 14:03.560
That sucks.

14:03.561 --> 14:05.028
You know, there's
a part of a lobster too,

14:05.029 --> 14:06.997
that you should always remove.

14:06.998 --> 14:08.699
The sack.

14:08.700 --> 14:11.702
That's a bad dish, a hair
followed by a sack.

14:13.271 --> 14:14.705
As predicted, three.

14:16.274 --> 14:18.442
Royce just served hair

14:18.443 --> 14:22.145
and a sack
to Michelin Star chefs?

14:22.146 --> 14:24.581
Like, what the
are you thinking, dude?

14:24.582 --> 14:27.751
The luck is totally changing.
We still have a chance.

14:27.752 --> 14:30.287
Okay, last up.
Christina, please.

14:30.288 --> 14:34.191
Even with Royce's dish
receiving the minimum score possible,

14:34.192 --> 14:37.627
Christina's dish must earn
at least six stars to tie.

14:37.628 --> 14:39.563
I have a steamed lobster tail,

14:39.564 --> 14:41.331
beautiful heirloom tomatoes,

14:41.332 --> 14:43.066
and I made a beurre blanc
with all the ingredients.

14:43.067 --> 14:44.101
Okay, great.

14:44.102 --> 14:45.535
<i>Anita, how was that?</i>

14:47.238 --> 14:49.740
I love the fact that you
seasoned the garnish.

14:49.741 --> 14:51.041
That was delicious.

14:51.042 --> 14:52.476
You cooked the lobster
beautifully.

14:52.477 --> 14:53.810
<i>All in all, bravo.</i>

14:53.811 --> 14:55.378
Two star. Great job.
Great start.

14:55.379 --> 14:56.747
Doug?

14:56.748 --> 14:58.949
Two star.

14:58.950 --> 15:00.784
Go, bitch, go!

15:00.785 --> 15:01.852
Anita, please?

15:01.853 --> 15:02.853
Hmm.

15:02.854 --> 15:06.690
It's hard.

15:06.691 --> 15:07.858
Yay!

15:07.859 --> 15:09.726
<i>Thanks, chef.</i>

15:09.727 --> 15:10.994
<i>Our first three star.</i>

15:10.995 --> 15:12.329
Chris, you did a great job.
Thank you, chef.

15:12.330 --> 15:13.964
Yeah! Yeah.

15:13.965 --> 15:15.832
I definitely
didn't expect that.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.502
I'm ecstatic right now,
absolutely elated.

15:18.503 --> 15:20.537
Judges, absolute honor
having you here.

15:20.538 --> 15:22.005
<i>Thank you so much.
Thank you, guys.</i>

15:22.006 --> 15:24.808
Thank you.

15:24.809 --> 15:26.243
Congratulations, red team, uh,

15:26.244 --> 15:28.245
Christina,

15:28.246 --> 15:30.781
next service,
that dish is going on.

15:30.782 --> 15:32.215
<i>Oh, wow.
Well done.</i>

15:32.216 --> 15:33.950
Oh, thank you, chef.

15:33.951 --> 15:36.119
It's pretty sick
to be sharing menu space

15:36.120 --> 15:37.521
with chef Ramsay.

15:37.522 --> 15:39.456
I couldn't be happier
or more proud.

15:39.457 --> 15:42.759
Ladies, you're in for
a very relaxing afternoon.

15:42.760 --> 15:46.096
I'm sending you all off to
the most amazing, luxurious spa.

15:46.097 --> 15:47.430
Yes!

15:49.167 --> 15:51.535
I'm not the girly-girl type,
so I never go to the spa.

15:51.536 --> 15:53.336
So this is exactly
what we needed.

15:53.337 --> 15:55.438
We needed to win
this challenge today.

15:55.439 --> 15:56.673
Thank the lord we did.

15:56.674 --> 15:58.508
Unfortunately, blue team,

15:58.509 --> 16:01.077
whilst the ladies are relaxing
and getting pampered,

16:01.078 --> 16:03.747
your day is gonna be
incredibly stressful.

16:03.748 --> 16:07.584
You're prepping both kitchens
ahead of tonight's service.

16:07.585 --> 16:09.386
Before you start prepping,

16:09.387 --> 16:12.389
I need you to start cleaning
everything in the dorm,

16:12.390 --> 16:14.224
the bedrooms,

16:14.225 --> 16:16.193
<i>the bathrooms.
The bathroom</i>

16:16.194 --> 16:18.195
needs to be scrubbed.
The bathroom smells like urine.

16:18.196 --> 16:20.163
<i>It is disgusting.
The pubic hair...</i>

16:20.164 --> 16:21.031
<i>Really, Barbie? Really?
Yeah, we got it.</i>

16:21.032 --> 16:22.265
The back of the toilet...

16:22.266 --> 16:23.500
We know.
Yeah, we got it.

16:23.501 --> 16:25.202
We know what we need
to clean, okay?

16:25.203 --> 16:27.604
"Oh, you got to clean
the bathroom, b-b-b-b-b-uh.

16:27.605 --> 16:29.172
Shut up,
I don't want to hear it.

16:29.173 --> 16:30.674
A lot of work ahead of you.

16:30.675 --> 16:32.576
<i>Oh, red team, one more thing,</i>

16:32.577 --> 16:35.979
in addition to the spa,
there's a wonderful surprise

16:35.980 --> 16:37.214
waiting for you upstairs.

16:37.215 --> 16:38.181
off you go.

16:40.184 --> 16:41.952
Hurry up, ladies,
you're gonna love this one.

16:41.953 --> 16:43.286
Yeah, come on!

16:43.287 --> 16:45.021
Where do we go?
Pots and pans!

16:45.022 --> 16:47.257
"Congrats.
Here's amazing set of cookware.

16:47.258 --> 16:49.392
Each of you is going to be
receiving your own set."

16:51.462 --> 16:54.865
The Meyer Cookware!
First-class all the way.

16:54.866 --> 16:56.299
Cannot wait to get
this stuff home.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.434
I'm pumped.

16:57.435 --> 16:58.568
Yeah!

16:58.569 --> 17:00.770
Royce, what the
were you doing

17:00.771 --> 17:02.305
with a hair that long
on the plate?

17:02.306 --> 17:03.673
I have no idea, chef.

17:03.674 --> 17:04.907
<i>Not good enough.</i>

17:04.909 --> 17:06.309
Get cleaning, guys.

17:06.310 --> 17:07.644
<i>Let's go.
Hurry up.</i>

17:07.645 --> 17:08.612
<i>Yes, chef.
Let's go.</i>

17:08.613 --> 17:10.396
While the blue team
heads upstairs

17:10.396 --> 17:11.915
for a day of punishment,

17:11.915 --> 17:12.749
Open those doors!

17:14.518 --> 17:17.075
The women head
out for a day of pampering.

17:19.223 --> 17:20.323
<i>Oh, so pretty.</i>

17:22.260 --> 17:25.362
We walk into the spa,
and it's just gorgeous.

17:25.363 --> 17:28.932
Like, everything is just white.
It's so relaxing.

17:28.933 --> 17:31.401
It's like
a breath of fresh air.

17:31.402 --> 17:33.770
<i>Guys, let's make a toast
to the red team.</i>

17:33.771 --> 17:35.272
To the red team.

17:35.273 --> 17:38.108
And to the dorm being clean
when we get back.

17:38.109 --> 17:41.378
Yay.

17:41.379 --> 17:43.246
Is it me or does
this smell like ass?

17:43.247 --> 17:45.582
Quite honestly,
the place is filthy and messy.

17:45.583 --> 17:47.250
You know, we're sweeping,
scrubbing out toilet bowls...

17:47.251 --> 17:48.852
Come on.

17:48.853 --> 17:50.587
I feel like
Suzy Homemaker over here.

17:50.588 --> 17:52.155
Definitely dirtier
than I thought.

17:52.156 --> 17:53.590
<i>Sucks.</i>

17:53.591 --> 17:55.358
Sucks, I'm sitting here
all day.

17:55.359 --> 17:56.526
Listen, I would take
the mani pedi

17:56.527 --> 17:58.595
and a massage any day.

18:00.698 --> 18:02.565
<i>That looks nice.</i>

18:02.566 --> 18:05.201
Leave it to you, dude.

18:08.472 --> 18:09.940
Well, Barbie doesn't
want to get in the tub

18:09.941 --> 18:12.375
because of our bodily fluids.

18:12.376 --> 18:14.077
Uh, we're not dirty, thank you.

18:14.078 --> 18:15.845
So I didn't pee
in the bathtub, okay?

18:15.846 --> 18:18.348
Hey, stop.
Just stop.

18:18.349 --> 18:19.883
Just try...
just try to relax.

18:19.884 --> 18:20.850
So I kind
of took offense to that,

18:20.851 --> 18:22.619
but she's just ignorant,

18:22.620 --> 18:24.421
so I expect that kind of comment
to come out of her mouth.

18:24.422 --> 18:25.155
No, I don't want to lay
next to her anyway.

18:25.156 --> 18:26.089
Yeah, you do.

18:26.090 --> 18:28.158
There's negative energy
on that sheet.

18:28.159 --> 18:29.326
While the red
team continues to find things

18:29.327 --> 18:30.660
to argue about at the spa,

18:30.661 --> 18:32.162
back in Hell's Kitchen,

18:32.163 --> 18:34.631
the blue team
has already begun prep

18:34.632 --> 18:36.166
for tonight's dinner service.

18:36.167 --> 18:37.167
I'm ready to rock
and roll, baby.

18:37.168 --> 18:38.735
I'm ready to kick some ass.

18:38.736 --> 18:40.270
I'm tired of getting
my beat down,

18:40.271 --> 18:41.604
but right now,
the important thing to me

18:41.605 --> 18:42.605
is dinner service.

18:42.606 --> 18:44.074
We got to win this.

18:44.075 --> 18:46.509
Let's beat
the red team tonight.

18:46.510 --> 18:48.278
I'm ready to go.

18:48.279 --> 18:50.547
Two hours
before dinner service,

18:50.548 --> 18:53.650
the women have returned from
their relaxing day at the spa,

18:53.651 --> 18:55.418
and quickly start their prep.

18:55.419 --> 18:57.821
We're missing a frisee salad.

18:57.822 --> 18:59.556
Hello?
I'm sorry?

18:59.557 --> 19:02.158
We're missing a frisee, right?
I'm asking you a question.

19:02.159 --> 19:03.560
But some of the chefs...

19:03.561 --> 19:04.861
Are you working that station?

19:04.862 --> 19:06.162
I've never worked
this station before.

19:06.163 --> 19:07.897
That's why I'm
asking you, Barbie.

19:07.898 --> 19:09.165
Still have
some tension to work out.

19:09.166 --> 19:10.600
I do not need this.

19:10.601 --> 19:12.802
You're working
that station, aren't you?

19:12.803 --> 19:15.171
Sink or swim,
I see how we go now.

19:15.172 --> 19:17.907
I'm gonna sink your ass deep.

19:25.639 --> 19:27.540
In spite of
all the ups and downs

19:27.541 --> 19:29.441
during
previous dinner services,

19:29.442 --> 19:31.844
chef Ramsay is expecting
tonight's service

19:31.845 --> 19:33.178
to be a lot smoother.

19:33.179 --> 19:34.146
Let's go, guys.
Line up, please.

19:34.147 --> 19:35.681
<i>Blue team, quick.</i>

19:35.682 --> 19:37.683
So he has a little
surprise for the chefs.

19:37.684 --> 19:39.118
Okay.

19:39.119 --> 19:42.187
<i>Tonight, I've invited
some very special people</i>

19:42.188 --> 19:45.057
to sit at our chef table
inside the kitchen

19:45.058 --> 19:47.526
during service.

19:47.527 --> 19:49.228
<i>Blue team, you will have</i>

19:49.229 --> 19:54.466
former UFC Light Heavyweight
of the World...

19:54.467 --> 19:56.201
Tito Ortiz.

19:56.202 --> 19:57.870
Oh, .

19:57.871 --> 19:59.805
Wow.

19:59.806 --> 20:01.473
<i>In the red kitchen,</i>

20:01.474 --> 20:05.077
you will have six-time
world champion

20:05.078 --> 20:06.478
and boxing legend...

20:07.514 --> 20:08.614
Sugar Ray Leonard.

20:11.551 --> 20:13.319
Nice.

20:13.320 --> 20:16.021
Robyn, I want you to take care
of Sugar Ray Leonard.

20:16.022 --> 20:17.356
Yes, chef.

20:17.357 --> 20:18.924
I am so stoked
that I have Sugar Ray Leonard

20:18.925 --> 20:20.092
in the kitchen.

20:21.661 --> 20:22.861
I'm going to start doing
some boxing moves.

20:22.862 --> 20:24.296
Bob and weave, I'm stoked.

20:24.297 --> 20:26.065
Justin,
host the chef's table for Tito.

20:26.066 --> 20:27.266
Yes, chef.

20:27.267 --> 20:28.968
Don't mess it up, guys.

20:28.969 --> 20:30.302
Serving Tito Ortiz
is a little nerve-racking,

20:30.303 --> 20:32.071
and I'm crossing my fingers

20:32.072 --> 20:33.639
that we don't make ourselves
look like idiots.

20:33.640 --> 20:36.742
Tonight, I want
each and every one of you

20:36.743 --> 20:37.743
<i>to fight back.</i>

20:37.744 --> 20:38.777
What do I want?

20:38.778 --> 20:39.979
Fight back.

20:39.980 --> 20:41.347
Let's go.
Yes, chef.

20:41.348 --> 20:42.881
Okay, James.
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.

20:42.882 --> 20:44.216
<i>Let's go.
Yes, chef. Thank you.</i>

20:44.217 --> 20:45.451
<i>Let's go.</i>

20:47.000 --> 20:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:54.027 --> 20:55.828
For tonight's dinner service,

20:55.829 --> 20:57.262
in addition
to his classic menu...

20:57.263 --> 20:58.697
Can we start with the risotto?

20:58.698 --> 21:00.299
I'll do the New York strip.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.134
Chef Ramsay has added

21:02.135 --> 21:03.702
Christina's challenge-winning
lobster dish

21:03.703 --> 21:05.337
as a special entree.

21:05.338 --> 21:06.672
<i>Here, chef.
Thank you.</i>

21:06.673 --> 21:07.706
Here we go.

21:07.707 --> 21:09.375
Blue team...
On order 4 couples, table 20.

21:09.376 --> 21:10.368
Two lobsters, spaghetti,
two risotto.

21:10.369 --> 21:11.910
Yes, chef.
Let's go.

21:11.911 --> 21:13.712
Two spaghetti.
Let's go, let's go.

21:13.713 --> 21:15.581
My team is looking
for an excuse to put me up,

21:15.582 --> 21:17.650
but you know what,
I'm ready to go.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.051
I'm ready to cook
what I know how to cook, man.

21:19.052 --> 21:20.586
Right now, spaghetti's up.

21:20.587 --> 21:22.988
Coming through.

21:22.989 --> 21:25.658
Hot pan, chef.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.393
me.

21:27.394 --> 21:28.961
<i>Clemenza!</i>

21:28.962 --> 21:30.596
Pasta was chewy!

21:30.597 --> 21:31.864
Yes, chef.

21:31.865 --> 21:33.465
It's not
rocket science.

21:33.466 --> 21:34.533
Come on, bro, come on, come on.

21:34.534 --> 21:35.167
Everything Clemenza
does something,

21:35.168 --> 21:36.335
he up.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.003
I've never seen anything
like it in my life.

21:38.004 --> 21:38.937
He just can't
cook anything right.

21:38.938 --> 21:41.106
Which was it?
Come on.

21:41.107 --> 21:44.176
Clemenza's inability to
cook pasta has put the blue team

21:44.177 --> 21:45.678
a little behind.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.746
Meanwhile,
in the red kitchen...

21:47.747 --> 21:49.248
30 seconds,
walking to the window

21:49.249 --> 21:50.649
with the first two risottos.

21:50.650 --> 21:52.117
Christina is
hoping her first risotto...

21:52.118 --> 21:54.253
Behind you, hot.
Chef.

21:54.254 --> 21:56.989
Will be in line with
chef Ramsay's exacting standards.

21:56.990 --> 21:59.758
Christina!

21:59.759 --> 22:00.893
It tastes delicious.

22:00.894 --> 22:02.795
Thank you, chef.
Service.

22:02.796 --> 22:05.230
Christina gets the
red team moving on appetizers.

22:05.231 --> 22:07.132
<i>Good job, Christina.</i>

22:07.133 --> 22:08.200
Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

22:08.201 --> 22:10.002
Risotto right here.

22:10.003 --> 22:12.604
Chef Ramsay is still
waiting on Clemenza for...

22:12.605 --> 22:14.306
Two lost spaghettis.
How long?

22:14.307 --> 22:15.974
Walking with spaghetti.

22:15.975 --> 22:17.676
Spaghetti's up, chef.

22:17.677 --> 22:20.379
Clemenza's an Italian,
so he's cooked pasta

22:20.380 --> 22:22.648
probably 17 billion times.

22:22.649 --> 22:28.520
You would think that he knows
what he's doing.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.389
There you go. Finally.

22:30.390 --> 22:31.390
Yes, chef.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.192
Service.

22:33.193 --> 22:35.427
Just as the blue team
starts pushing out appetizers...

22:35.428 --> 22:37.229
Really good.

22:37.230 --> 22:40.466
Chef Ramsay's
VIP guests arrive.

22:40.467 --> 22:42.367
Show some grace
will you please, yeah?

22:42.368 --> 22:43.702
We're going to spoil them, yes?

22:43.703 --> 22:44.770
<i>Oui, chef.</i>

22:44.771 --> 22:45.838
Thank you.
Thank you.

22:45.839 --> 22:47.206
Evening.
Hi.

22:47.207 --> 22:49.007
<i>Welcome to Hell's Kitchen.</i>

22:49.008 --> 22:50.809
I hope you're going
to enjoy this show.

22:50.810 --> 22:51.977
You have the best seat
in the house.

22:51.978 --> 22:53.479
<i>Good to see you.
Welcome.</i>

22:53.480 --> 22:56.215
How you doing?
Nice to see you, my darling.

22:56.216 --> 22:57.616
Good evening.

22:57.617 --> 22:59.151
What's up, man?
How are you doing?

22:59.152 --> 23:00.552
How are you doing tonight?
Good, man, really good.

23:00.553 --> 23:01.353
Hi, my name's Justin.
Nice to meet you guys.

23:01.354 --> 23:02.521
A pleasure.

23:02.522 --> 23:04.623
I'm going to start you guys
with a couple of drinks.

23:04.624 --> 23:05.657
I'll get a Arnold Palmer, please.
Arnold Palmer?

23:05.658 --> 23:06.992
Yeah, please.
Very nice choice.

23:06.993 --> 23:08.427
I've never served in my life,
so serving Tito Ortiz

23:08.428 --> 23:09.595
is a little nerve-racking.

23:09.596 --> 23:10.763
It's a lot of pressure.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.564
Aww, man.

23:12.565 --> 23:15.033
On order.
Chef's table.

23:15.034 --> 23:16.435
One risotto,
one lobster, spaghetti.

23:16.436 --> 23:17.402
Yes, chef.

23:17.403 --> 23:19.138
<i>Let's go, guys.</i>

23:19.139 --> 23:21.240
This is the first time we've had
somebody at the chef's table.

23:21.241 --> 23:24.042
They are so close to my station
that if I up their food,

23:24.043 --> 23:25.244
like, I'm dead.

23:25.245 --> 23:26.712
It's Sugar Ray Leonard.

23:26.713 --> 23:29.014
I'm sure his wife
can throw a punch too.

23:29.015 --> 23:30.215
Walking to the window.

23:30.216 --> 23:32.251
I'm with you.
I'm with you.

23:32.252 --> 23:36.054
Risotto's down.
Thank you.

23:37.056 --> 23:38.390
All of you.

23:38.391 --> 23:41.860
Taste that risotto.
All of you.

23:41.861 --> 23:43.495
<i>What's wrong with that?
It's undercooked.</i>

23:43.496 --> 23:45.097
<i>It's very undercooked.</i>

23:45.098 --> 23:46.765
It's
completely underdone.

23:46.766 --> 23:48.534
I'm talking, like, horrible.

23:48.535 --> 23:49.802
And I'm just, like,
"are you kidding me?"

23:49.803 --> 23:50.702
Sorry, guys.

23:50.703 --> 23:52.204
Christina.

23:52.205 --> 23:54.239
You hit perfection at the
beginning of the service.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.041
Then all of a sudden,
undercooked rice.

23:56.042 --> 23:57.843
My bad, guys.

23:57.844 --> 24:00.245
While Christina missed
the mark with her risotto...

24:00.246 --> 24:01.413
Start again.

24:02.682 --> 24:04.183
In the blue kitchen...

24:04.184 --> 24:05.751
On order, chef's table.

24:05.752 --> 24:07.753
One risotto, one scallops.
Quickly, let's go.

24:07.754 --> 24:09.354
Yes, chef.

24:09.355 --> 24:11.523
Brian is ready
to rumble with his risotto.

24:13.593 --> 24:15.260
This is something
I have trained for.

24:15.261 --> 24:16.762
I am ready.

24:16.763 --> 24:17.763
Risotto?

24:17.764 --> 24:18.864
How long, Brian?

24:18.865 --> 24:20.332
Coming right now.

24:20.333 --> 24:24.970
You got your glazed carrots?

24:24.971 --> 24:26.038
soupy.

24:26.039 --> 24:27.272
Soupy?

24:27.273 --> 24:28.674
Yeah, you... I can fix
it right now, chef.

24:28.675 --> 24:29.608
But you know it is.

24:29.609 --> 24:31.009
off, Brian.
Yes, chef.

24:31.010 --> 24:32.411
Oh, no.

24:32.412 --> 24:35.280
No, no, no, no, no.
Not... not already.

24:35.281 --> 24:37.316
I have three VIP guests
out on the chef's table,

24:37.317 --> 24:38.584
<i>and you serve them
risotto.</i>

24:38.585 --> 24:39.952
Stupidity, chef.

24:39.953 --> 24:41.553
<i>You know it's
wrong when you send it.</i>

24:41.554 --> 24:42.788
lazy.

24:42.789 --> 24:44.056
Yes, chef.

24:44.057 --> 24:46.191
This isn't happening
right now, is it?

24:46.192 --> 24:49.127
Really, Brian?
You .

24:49.128 --> 24:50.629
Un believable.

24:50.630 --> 24:51.897
While Brian beats himself up,

24:51.898 --> 24:53.398
back in the red kitchen...

24:53.399 --> 24:55.234
Walking with the risotto.

24:55.235 --> 24:57.302
Christina is hoping
her second attempt

24:57.303 --> 25:01.874
at the VIP table's risotto
will get her off the ropes.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.609
Christina...
It's seasoned perfectly.

25:03.610 --> 25:04.610
Thank you, chef.

25:04.611 --> 25:06.511
Yeah, yeah.

25:06.512 --> 25:08.881
With Christina's
head back in the game,

25:08.882 --> 25:11.083
the red team starts
knocking out their tickets...

25:11.084 --> 25:12.517
I'm going with scallops, okay?

25:12.518 --> 25:13.318
You're going with scallops?

25:13.319 --> 25:14.353
<i>Yes, thank you.</i>

25:14.354 --> 25:15.654
Scallops, right here.

25:15.655 --> 25:16.722
<i>Service, please.</i>

25:16.723 --> 25:18.223
Gently, gently, gently.

25:18.224 --> 25:19.892
Delivering
over half of their appetizers

25:19.893 --> 25:20.959
to the dining room.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.594
That is really good.

25:22.595 --> 25:24.162
It's tasty.

25:24.163 --> 25:26.098
Meanwhile,
over in the blue kitchen,

25:26.099 --> 25:27.299
Brian, how long, please?

25:27.300 --> 25:29.067
Risotto coming right now.

25:29.068 --> 25:31.303
Brian is
hoping his second attempt

25:31.304 --> 25:33.305
at the VIP table's risotto
will be good enough

25:33.306 --> 25:35.173
for one tough customer.

25:35.174 --> 25:38.710
Please, please.

25:38.711 --> 25:39.711
Brian.

25:39.712 --> 25:40.712
Yes, chef?

25:40.713 --> 25:41.713
Perfect.

25:41.714 --> 25:42.714
Thank you, chef.

25:44.751 --> 25:45.817
How is everything, guys?

25:45.818 --> 25:46.852
Amazing.

25:46.853 --> 25:48.186
I'm a sometimes.

25:48.187 --> 25:49.254
We all make mistakes, right?

25:49.255 --> 25:50.222
I apologize.

25:53.226 --> 25:55.527
Enjoy.
Enjoy, guys.

25:55.528 --> 25:57.529
<i>Thank you.
Yeah.</i>

25:57.530 --> 25:59.498
With the chef's table served...

25:59.499 --> 26:00.732
Come on, guys.
Keep fighting, keep fighting.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.434
The blue team picks up the pace.

26:02.435 --> 26:04.036
Meanwhile, in the red kitchen...

26:04.037 --> 26:05.570
On order.
Two lobsters, two Wellingtons.

26:05.571 --> 26:06.571
Yes, chef.

26:06.572 --> 26:08.040
Let's go.

26:08.041 --> 26:09.441
The women
have moved on to entrees.

26:09.442 --> 26:14.079
How long?

26:14.080 --> 26:17.449
Tiffany,
what the are you doing?

26:17.450 --> 26:18.817
You put the knife
on the bottom of your lip?

26:18.818 --> 26:19.618
Yes, chef.

26:19.619 --> 26:20.919
And then put the knife back in?

26:20.920 --> 26:23.088
Yes, chef.

26:23.089 --> 26:25.724
Tiffany is basically making out
with the Wellington.

26:26.759 --> 26:28.460
It is disgusting.

26:28.461 --> 26:30.028
It hits her lip,
and then it goes back

26:30.029 --> 26:30.963
into the Wellington.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.030
Un... unsanitary,
I know, chef.

26:32.031 --> 26:33.131
It's not funny.

26:33.132 --> 26:34.232
<i>Start again.</i>

26:34.233 --> 26:35.067
Do something Barbie.

26:35.068 --> 26:36.535
Yes, chef.

26:36.536 --> 26:38.437
As the red team
tries to regroup...

26:38.438 --> 26:40.305
Let's focus, ladies.
Come on.

26:40.306 --> 26:42.074
Over in the blue kitchen...

26:42.075 --> 26:43.508
Away now, two lobsters,
two Wellingtons,

26:43.509 --> 26:45.477
two New York strips.
Yes, chef.

26:45.478 --> 26:49.014
Patrick on
fish and Roshni on meats,

26:49.015 --> 26:50.782
are attempting to get out
the first table of entrees.

26:50.783 --> 26:51.817
How long?

26:51.818 --> 26:53.251
Four minutes, chef.

26:53.252 --> 26:54.386
So my lobster's four minutes
out?

26:54.387 --> 26:55.520
Yes.

26:55.521 --> 26:57.356
I'm feeling confident
about this.

26:57.357 --> 26:59.624
My Wellington and strips perfect
slightly pink.

26:59.625 --> 27:01.193
Two Wellingtons, walking.

27:01.194 --> 27:02.694
Lobster pass.

27:02.695 --> 27:04.162
I'm dying for
the New York strip.

27:04.163 --> 27:05.063
One minute, chef.

27:05.064 --> 27:06.231
Let's go.

27:06.232 --> 27:07.599
Yes, chef, right now, chef.

27:07.600 --> 27:08.667
Come on, let's go.

27:08.668 --> 27:11.503
I'm sorry, chef.

27:11.504 --> 27:13.438
That's still raw.

27:13.439 --> 27:15.207
Not doing so hot over here,
either.

27:15.208 --> 27:17.509
It's over cooked.
It's white.

27:17.510 --> 27:19.444
Blue team.
All of you, come here.

27:19.445 --> 27:21.980
What temperature are these,
chef?

27:21.981 --> 27:23.081
Medium well, chef.

27:23.082 --> 27:24.182
<i>Medium well.</i>

27:24.183 --> 27:27.152
Roshni, come on.

27:27.153 --> 27:31.089
And then this.
Raw.

27:31.090 --> 27:33.525
Our first table.

27:33.526 --> 27:34.626
I'm about to kick you out.

27:34.627 --> 27:35.527
Is that your best?

27:35.528 --> 27:36.828
No, chef.

27:36.829 --> 27:37.929
Is this it now?
The beginning of the end?

27:37.930 --> 27:38.630
No, chef.

27:38.631 --> 27:40.432
What's going on?

27:40.433 --> 27:41.533
Oh, .

27:41.534 --> 27:42.601
I'm screwed.

27:42.602 --> 27:44.002
idiots.

27:44.003 --> 27:45.003
Pull it together.

27:45.004 --> 27:46.004
Come on.

27:52.651 --> 27:54.552
It's nearly an hour
and a half into dinner service,

27:54.553 --> 27:55.486
and the blue team...

27:55.487 --> 27:57.688
Our first table.

27:57.689 --> 28:00.458
Still has not served
their first table of entrees.

28:00.459 --> 28:01.826
Is that your best?
Honestly?

28:01.827 --> 28:03.194
No, chef.

28:03.195 --> 28:04.962
<i>What's going on?</i>

28:04.963 --> 28:07.098
<i>Wake up.</i>

28:07.099 --> 28:09.267
Two lobster, two Wellington,
two New York strip.

28:09.268 --> 28:10.868
<i>Start again.</i>

28:10.869 --> 28:12.103
Work the two New York.
Work the two New York.

28:12.104 --> 28:13.404
Okay.

28:13.405 --> 28:15.306
Come on, man, it's just
a piece of steak.

28:15.307 --> 28:16.207
Yeah, just make sure
they're cooked.

28:16.208 --> 28:17.742
I better do something
to fix this

28:17.743 --> 28:18.643
because she's bringing
the team down.

28:18.644 --> 28:19.844
We're under a minute.

28:19.845 --> 28:21.712
I got you.
I'll work the oven.

28:21.713 --> 28:23.080
While Roshni
and Clemenza start over

28:23.081 --> 28:24.315
on another round of meat...

28:24.316 --> 28:25.082
Let's go.

28:25.083 --> 28:26.083
Pick it up.

28:26.084 --> 28:27.285
Yes, chef.

28:27.286 --> 28:28.853
In the red kitchen...

28:28.854 --> 28:31.055
I'm originally
from New York City.

28:31.056 --> 28:33.658
Robyn is serving up more
than food to the special guests.

28:33.659 --> 28:37.094
Before I was a chef,
I was in cosmetology school.

28:37.095 --> 28:38.963
My whole life,
I wanted to be a nurse.

28:38.964 --> 28:40.865
And I was waiting tables,
my mom was, like,

28:40.866 --> 28:42.433
"you can't be a server
your whole life."

28:42.434 --> 28:43.701
And I'm not that feminine.

28:43.702 --> 28:45.636
So after that, I was
in the hospitality industry...

28:45.637 --> 28:47.238
I'm great with my hands.

28:47.239 --> 28:48.606
I just couldn't figure out
what my talent is.

28:48.607 --> 28:49.607
And I...

28:49.608 --> 28:50.608
Hey, Robyn.

28:50.609 --> 28:52.076
Nobody cares.

28:52.077 --> 28:55.379
So if you could just...
stop talking,

28:55.380 --> 28:57.081
we'd probably do a little
better.

28:57.082 --> 28:58.783
My thing is that
sometimes people think

28:58.784 --> 29:00.985
I'm a little bit too aggressive,
but that's just my mannerisms,

29:00.986 --> 29:03.087
from where I'm from.

29:03.088 --> 29:04.455
I'm on cloud nine,

29:04.456 --> 29:06.023
we're "conversating"
back and forth...

29:06.024 --> 29:09.527
Sugar Ray and his wife...
they love me.

29:09.528 --> 29:13.564
Love me.

29:13.565 --> 29:15.232
Entrees, how long?

29:15.233 --> 29:16.334
Almost ready on two wellies.

29:16.335 --> 29:17.501
Let's go.

29:17.502 --> 29:18.869
Here. Where' s your sauce?

29:18.870 --> 29:20.538
I have it.
You have it?

29:20.539 --> 29:21.906
<i>Yes, Barbie.
Okay.</i>

29:21.907 --> 29:23.040
Hey, Barbie.

29:23.041 --> 29:25.009
Just, like, move of my station

29:25.010 --> 29:26.610
because I don't need help.

29:26.611 --> 29:28.713
Walking with two Wellingtons,
two garnish.

29:33.218 --> 29:34.785
Hey.
Robyn.

29:34.786 --> 29:37.688
Come here.
All of you, come here.

29:37.689 --> 29:39.156
Robyn.
Urgently.

29:39.157 --> 29:41.192
Sir, I'm sorry.
Go, go, go.

29:41.193 --> 29:42.226
Yeah, I'm not going to do it
in front of a legend.

29:42.227 --> 29:43.094
I know, I know, I know.

29:43.095 --> 29:44.729
I am not going
to go anywhere near it.

29:44.730 --> 29:48.466
I mean, are you ...
I mean, honestly?

29:48.467 --> 29:50.568
Honestly?
Please?

29:50.569 --> 29:52.203
I told you so, Tiffany.

29:52.204 --> 29:53.604
Coming down, hot.
Coming down, hot.

29:53.605 --> 29:54.772
Where are you going?

29:54.773 --> 29:56.374
Into the convection oven...

29:56.375 --> 29:58.309
She's always all over my .
What?

29:58.310 --> 29:59.710
She's ...

29:59.711 --> 30:01.312
But can you please organize it,
Tiffany?

30:01.313 --> 30:02.413
Yeah, I got it organized.

30:02.414 --> 30:03.981
She's picking up
that's already cooked.

30:03.982 --> 30:04.882
<i>I don't know
what she's doing.</i>

30:04.883 --> 30:06.117
Well, tell her that.

30:06.118 --> 30:08.119
Well, I've been
trying to tell her that.

30:08.120 --> 30:08.786
While the
red team struggles

30:08.787 --> 30:10.087
with their communication.

30:10.088 --> 30:11.555
Well, I just that one.

30:11.556 --> 30:13.457
In the blue kitchen...

30:13.458 --> 30:15.559
Two lobster, two Wellington,
two New York strip.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.795
Six minutes, chef.
Six minutes, chef.

30:17.796 --> 30:19.730
Roshni and Patrick
are looking to make a comeback

30:19.731 --> 30:21.165
on the first table of entrees.

30:21.166 --> 30:22.800
These ones are just seared off.

30:22.801 --> 30:24.935
I'm in the weeds,
but every time these fighters

30:24.936 --> 30:26.937
were hit, knocked down,
they fought back

30:26.938 --> 30:28.906
to become champions,
so I am going to fight back.

30:28.907 --> 30:30.674
<i>That has another minute.</i>

30:30.675 --> 30:32.743
By the time I carve that,
that will be ready to go.

30:32.744 --> 30:34.145
I need it urgently.

30:34.146 --> 30:36.146
Yes, chef.
Walking with sauces, chef.

30:37.149 --> 30:38.849
<i>Walk with it, Clemenza.
Please.</i>

30:38.850 --> 30:40.484
Come on there.
Where's the garnish, please?

30:40.485 --> 30:45.022
<i>Lobster to pass.
Little warm.</i>

30:45.023 --> 30:47.324
me.

30:47.325 --> 30:48.325
Stone cold.

30:48.326 --> 30:50.361
Hey.

30:50.362 --> 30:53.063
Patrick,
lobster's stone-cold.

30:53.064 --> 30:55.032
Stone cold.

30:55.033 --> 30:56.734
I'll get two more going, chef.

30:56.735 --> 30:59.069
Patrick,
what the are you doing?

30:59.070 --> 31:00.738
It's like you've never cooked
before.

31:00.739 --> 31:02.473
Come on.
Urgently.

31:02.474 --> 31:04.942
Chef, I got two new ones
in the... in the water, chef.

31:04.943 --> 31:07.311
While the blue team
starts over on their entrees,

31:07.312 --> 31:08.546
get a grip and pick it up.

31:08.547 --> 31:10.047
Yes, chef.

31:10.048 --> 31:11.482
In the red kitchen...

31:11.483 --> 31:12.516
How long?

31:12.517 --> 31:14.518
Give me about
1 1/2 minute please?

31:14.519 --> 31:16.921
Tiffany is hoping her
second attempt at beef Wellingtons

31:16.922 --> 31:18.055
is a hit with chef Ramsay.

31:18.056 --> 31:19.123
I'm ready.

31:19.124 --> 31:24.128
Walking with two Wellingtons.

31:27.365 --> 31:31.001
<i>Tiffany?
Yes, chef?</i>

31:31.002 --> 31:33.304
Now they're perfect.
Thank you, chef.

31:33.305 --> 31:34.705
What is it?
One , one good...

31:34.706 --> 31:35.773
yeah, I'm not laughing.

31:35.774 --> 31:37.074
I'm not laughing, chef.

31:37.075 --> 31:38.209
I'm not laughing.
That's perfect.

31:38.210 --> 31:38.909
Thank you, chef.
What's next?

31:38.910 --> 31:43.547
Uh...

31:43.548 --> 31:45.950
A perfect Wellington, chef?

31:45.951 --> 31:48.786
So, Dana, whenever you're ready,
a minute on the wellies.

31:48.787 --> 31:51.889
Whew, thank God I didn't get
yelled at for that one.

31:51.890 --> 31:53.257
Sea bass walking.

31:53.258 --> 31:55.459
Two chickens, two wellies.
Service.

31:55.460 --> 31:58.329
Entrees are now
steadily leaving the red kitchen.

31:58.330 --> 31:59.497
Cooked just right.

31:59.498 --> 32:00.531
Delicious.

32:00.532 --> 32:03.267
Meanwhile...

32:03.268 --> 32:05.369
Let's go.
You counting down?

32:05.370 --> 32:07.505
A frustrated chef
Ramsay is hoping the blue team

32:07.506 --> 32:09.473
will finally
get their act together.

32:09.474 --> 32:10.574
How long?

32:10.575 --> 32:12.042
Roshni, how long do you need?

32:12.043 --> 32:13.844
<i>45 seconds.
45 seconds, okay.</i>

32:13.845 --> 32:16.480
I made a mistake there,
but I don't let that rattle me,

32:16.481 --> 32:18.148
so I just got to keep
bringing it harder and harder

32:18.149 --> 32:19.116
and harder.

32:19.117 --> 32:20.651
I'm ready whenever you are.

32:20.652 --> 32:21.986
I'm ready, let me know.

32:21.987 --> 32:23.320
Go to the pass.
Go, hurry.

32:23.321 --> 32:24.655
Two Wellingtons, walking.

32:24.656 --> 32:25.890
Garnish, Royce.

32:25.891 --> 32:28.826
Yes, chef.

32:28.827 --> 32:32.062
Up to the pass,
and the pan is hot.

32:32.063 --> 32:35.633
Oh, my God.
me.

32:35.634 --> 32:36.634
Hey, come here, you.

32:36.635 --> 32:38.369
All of you!

32:38.370 --> 32:40.671
Not one of you know what
the is going on.

32:40.672 --> 32:42.006
And you're embarrassing me
in front of him.

32:42.007 --> 32:43.307
Come here.

32:43.308 --> 32:46.544
Cold lobster
for the second time tonight.

32:46.545 --> 32:48.679
I swear to God.

32:48.680 --> 32:49.847
Look at me.

32:49.848 --> 32:51.081
I got one big message for you.

32:51.082 --> 32:54.852
Hey, you.
Get out.

32:54.853 --> 32:56.020
off.
I'll do it on my own.

32:56.021 --> 32:57.321
Get out.

32:57.322 --> 32:59.123
Get out.
I don't want to get out, chef.

32:59.124 --> 33:01.125
You want to argue
in front of me?

33:01.126 --> 33:02.793
Get out.
You, get out.

33:02.794 --> 33:06.230
off.
Totally useless.

33:06.231 --> 33:10.401
Get out.
Get out!

33:15.827 --> 33:17.928
Two hours into dinner service,

33:17.929 --> 33:20.631
the blue team has failed
to send out a single entree.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.834
Cold lobster
for the second time tonight.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.303
And chef Ramsay has decided...

33:25.304 --> 33:26.804
Get out.

33:26.805 --> 33:29.140
That he is
left with only one option.

33:29.141 --> 33:30.574
I'll do it on my own.
Get out.

33:30.575 --> 33:31.842
off.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.611
The blue team
crumbled again.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.346
I was just aggravated,
man.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.117
Back in the red kitchen...

33:40.118 --> 33:41.786
Two bass, one Wellington.
Working, yes?

33:41.787 --> 33:43.421
Two minutes, chef.

33:43.422 --> 33:45.189
The women are
in the home stretch.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.657
Last table, please.
Let's go.

33:46.658 --> 33:47.758
Coming right now, chef.

33:47.759 --> 33:48.926
I'm walking with garnish.

33:48.927 --> 33:50.594
Walking with garnish, Kimmie.

33:50.595 --> 33:52.063
Garnish on the pass.

33:52.064 --> 33:53.197
Behind.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.101
Walking, chef.

33:57.402 --> 34:00.438
Service.
Go, please.

34:00.439 --> 34:02.340
<i>Cooked perfectly.
Oh, that's good.</i>

34:02.341 --> 34:04.308
Guys, thank you
so much for your help.

34:04.309 --> 34:06.544
The red team
nailed it tonight.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.713
Whoo!
I'm so stoked!

34:08.714 --> 34:09.714
Ladies...

34:09.715 --> 34:11.114
Yes, chef?

34:11.116 --> 34:12.116
Come into the blue team,
let's go.

34:12.117 --> 34:13.317
I got this, chef.

34:13.318 --> 34:15.252
With diners on the red side fed,

34:15.253 --> 34:17.588
the red team hurries to complete
orders for the blue kitchen.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.023
All hands on deck, let's go.

34:19.024 --> 34:20.491
Come on, guys.
Come on, guys.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.493
Red team definitely killing it.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.428
Now we're picking up other
people's slack.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.929
As you can see,
your kitchen's changed color.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.164
The women took over.

34:27.165 --> 34:28.466
<i>Walking on bass.
Thank you.</i>

34:28.467 --> 34:29.467
Garnish for sea bass.

34:29.467 --> 34:31.302
Service, please.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.237
With the women somehow
coming together as a team...

34:33.237 --> 34:34.505
Walking down with the wellies.

34:34.505 --> 34:35.806
Walking with lobster sauce.

34:35.806 --> 34:38.007
Go please, service, let's go.

34:38.009 --> 34:39.543
They push our entrees
in a very efficient manner.

34:39.543 --> 34:40.543
Thank you.

34:40.545 --> 34:41.712
Good job, guys.

34:41.713 --> 34:42.980
Oh, wait till you taste that.

34:42.981 --> 34:45.815
<i>Now that's good.</i>

34:45.817 --> 34:47.551
With dinner service complete...

34:47.552 --> 34:48.552
<i>He's really mad.</i>

34:48.553 --> 34:50.987
Yeah, as he should be.
No, really mad.

34:50.989 --> 34:53.123
Chef Scott makes
a rare visit to the dorm.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.159
Let's go, everybody.
Downstairs right now.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.527
Yes, chef.

34:56.527 --> 34:57.762
Chef wants to talk
to all of you.

34:57.763 --> 35:01.499
Absolutely, chef.
Right now.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.833
<i>Stay there, all of you.</i>

35:02.834 --> 35:04.368
Just stay there.

35:04.369 --> 35:07.271
There's no way on earth
you're going back in there.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.240
<i>I'm done.</i>

35:09.241 --> 35:11.242
Red team finished for you.
Brilliantly.

35:11.243 --> 35:12.543
Brilliantly.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.612
How can they be
so much better than you?

35:14.613 --> 35:15.780
They're not, chef.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.181
They're not?
No.

35:17.182 --> 35:19.216
You served me
soupy risotto.

35:19.217 --> 35:20.618
<i>Wellingtons undercooked.</i>

35:20.619 --> 35:22.019
<i>Cold lobster twice.</i>

35:22.020 --> 35:24.088
It's an absolute joke.

35:24.089 --> 35:26.857
He had every right to be mad.
It was embarrassing.

35:26.858 --> 35:29.593
It's our seventh dinner service.
It's embarrassing.

35:29.594 --> 35:32.062
All of you,
go upstairs and decide

35:32.063 --> 35:33.464
on two individuals leaving.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.799
Don't take long.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.337
<i>off.</i>

35:43.508 --> 35:46.043
At this point, it's, like,
who's not going to help us?

35:46.044 --> 35:48.779
Who's the weaker link?

35:48.780 --> 35:50.714
Right now,
I can't deny my mistakes,

35:50.715 --> 35:52.683
but I need to keep the focus
away from myself,

35:52.684 --> 35:54.585
and do my best to sway them.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.320
I'm going to have to nominate

35:56.321 --> 35:59.056
Clemenza and Brian
for the appetizers.

35:59.057 --> 36:00.658
Whoaa...
Wait a minute.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.460
Who the
does this guy think he is?

36:02.461 --> 36:04.361
That's just insanity.

36:04.362 --> 36:06.864
It seemed like a long time for
those first apps to go out.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.867
I did not hold up that kitchen.
I didn't.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.969
Are you serious,
you idiot?

36:11.970 --> 36:15.439
There's no way me and Clemenza
deserve to be up there tonight.

36:15.440 --> 36:18.209
These people are overlooking
their own mistakes.

36:18.210 --> 36:20.211
I-I got to put up Patrick,
number one.

36:20.212 --> 36:22.513
Rosh, number two.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.647
Yeah.

36:23.648 --> 36:26.550
Rosh bombed tonight
in a major way.

36:26.551 --> 36:28.385
That meat station sank.

36:28.386 --> 36:30.654
I mean, you were
searing in cold pans,

36:30.655 --> 36:33.457
I watched you cut
a few things raw.

36:33.458 --> 36:37.461
One table got sent back.
That was it.

36:37.462 --> 36:39.296
Guys, we got to make
this decision.

36:55.547 --> 36:56.680
Ladies, good job.

36:56.681 --> 36:58.115
Thank you, chef.

36:58.116 --> 36:59.483
Blue team,
have you reached a decision?

36:59.484 --> 37:00.818
Yes, chef.
Good.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.988
Brian, first nominee and why.

37:03.989 --> 37:08.359
Uh, our first nominee
tonight is myself, chef.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.861
What?

37:10.862 --> 37:12.696
Yes, I was nominated, chef.

37:12.697 --> 37:15.099
Why were you nominated?

37:15.100 --> 37:18.269
It was pretty much put on me
that the first ticket

37:18.270 --> 37:22.239
was what slowed us down,
and that's it.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.475
That doesn't make any sense.

37:24.476 --> 37:26.210
Who's the second nominee
and why?

37:26.211 --> 37:28.879
The second nominee
was Clemenza, chef.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.615
What?

37:31.616 --> 37:34.552
I don't understand that.
I mean, I just...

37:34.553 --> 37:37.555
The stumbling block
wasn't the appetizers.

37:37.556 --> 37:39.056
Why did Clemenza get nominated?

37:39.057 --> 37:41.659
I-I don't know.

37:41.660 --> 37:45.129
Do you guys
take this seriously?

37:45.130 --> 37:47.665
Brian and Clemenza
do not deserve to be up there,

37:47.666 --> 37:50.734
let me tell you that.

37:50.735 --> 37:52.269
There's two nominees
that deserve to be

37:52.270 --> 37:54.772
in the middle right there.

37:54.773 --> 37:57.541
The two worst tonight are...

38:03.131 --> 38:05.232
After failing
to deliver a single entree

38:05.233 --> 38:06.967
at dinner service,
the blue team

38:06.968 --> 38:08.735
has surprisingly
nominated the two men

38:08.736 --> 38:12.539
on the appetizer station...
Brian and Clemenza.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.107
Brian and Clemenza do not
deserve to be up there,

38:14.108 --> 38:15.942
let me tell you that.

38:15.943 --> 38:20.147
But chef Ramsay has
his eyes on two other chefs.

38:20.148 --> 38:22.215
There's two nominees
that deserve to be in the middle

38:22.216 --> 38:23.800
right there...

38:27.777 --> 38:30.423
Roshni, Patrick...
get up here.

38:30.424 --> 38:34.694
Fish and meat.

38:34.695 --> 38:37.597
<i>Patrick, why do you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen?</i>

38:37.598 --> 38:39.399
I get these guys going,
I keep them on focus,

38:39.400 --> 38:40.901
I keep them on point.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.435
I have made mistakes,
there's no doubt,

38:42.436 --> 38:43.937
but I am nowhere near done.

38:43.938 --> 38:45.605
<i>I have so much more to offer.</i>

38:45.606 --> 38:48.875
It's not about what you say,
it's how you perform.

38:48.876 --> 38:51.211
Yes, chef.

38:51.212 --> 38:53.380
<i>Roshni, why do you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen?</i>

38:53.381 --> 38:54.514
Since I've come
on the blue team, chef,

38:54.515 --> 38:55.682
I have improved.

38:55.683 --> 38:57.450
<i>The first night of service,</i>

38:57.451 --> 38:58.919
myself and Brian finished
service on our own.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.620
And I'm a team player.

39:00.621 --> 39:02.622
I am honest, loyal,
and dedicated.

39:02.623 --> 39:07.761
Today, yes, I screwed up,
but I am here to stay, chef.

39:08.763 --> 39:11.865
Tough one tonight.

39:11.866 --> 39:12.866
Justin.

39:12.867 --> 39:17.537
<i>Who shall I send home?</i>

39:19.807 --> 39:22.075
Roshni, chef.

39:22.076 --> 39:24.144
Brian, who shall I send home?

39:24.145 --> 39:26.346
Roshni, chef.

39:26.347 --> 39:27.380
Royce.

39:27.381 --> 39:30.317
Patrick, chef.

39:30.318 --> 39:36.156
Clemenza.
Who shall I send home?

39:36.157 --> 39:40.193
I-I'd have to say...

39:40.194 --> 39:42.562
Roshni, on what I've seen
in two days on our team.

39:42.563 --> 39:44.564
Two days?
I finished the service

39:44.565 --> 39:46.833
<i>when you guys got kicked out.</i>

39:46.834 --> 39:48.835
You're going to tell me
I deserve to go home?

39:48.836 --> 39:50.637
You guys all got kicked
out of that kitchen.

39:50.638 --> 39:56.643
Myself and Brian finished
that service.

39:57.645 --> 39:59.813
Okay.

39:59.814 --> 40:03.589
<i>The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen is...</i>

40:07.326 --> 40:08.388
Roshni.

40:08.389 --> 40:10.190
Give me your jacket, please.

40:10.191 --> 40:14.294
<i>Your time is done
in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

40:14.295 --> 40:16.162
I know you have a lot of heart.

40:16.163 --> 40:18.665
Don't you stop that, okay?
I won't, chef.

40:18.666 --> 40:19.666
Head up, high.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.201
Always.
Thank you.

40:21.202 --> 40:23.670
Love you, Rosh. Thank you.
Bye, Rosh.

40:30.411 --> 40:31.911
I'm extremely disappointed.

40:31.912 --> 40:34.180
<i>I'm not
in Hell's Kitchen anymore.</i>

40:34.181 --> 40:36.783
It's a competition, and
I'm definitely not the weakest.

40:36.784 --> 40:38.818
I never got involved
in the drama.

40:38.819 --> 40:40.654
I never got involved
in all the .

40:40.655 --> 40:42.355
I was here for a purpose.

40:42.356 --> 40:45.358
I just don't think
I got enough time to prove it.

40:45.359 --> 40:47.635
Patrick, back in line.

40:49.363 --> 40:52.232
Blue team, don't me.

40:52.233 --> 40:53.333
Got it?

40:53.334 --> 40:54.367
Yes, chef.

40:54.368 --> 40:56.770
off.

40:56.771 --> 40:58.638
Obviously,
Royce has got it out for me,

40:58.639 --> 41:00.173
so I really only got
three other teammates.

41:00.174 --> 41:02.042
A guy like that is a liability.

41:02.043 --> 41:04.177
It's just a matter of time
before I get him out of here.

41:04.178 --> 41:06.780
I did not deserve
to be up there.

41:06.781 --> 41:08.081
Not even close.

41:08.082 --> 41:10.850
Maybe they're thinking
I'm a threat.

41:10.851 --> 41:12.952
If that's the case, good,

41:12.953 --> 41:15.955
because I am a threat.
I'm a very big threat.

41:15.956 --> 41:18.825
We are definitely
crushing the guys.

41:18.826 --> 41:20.894
I mean, look at them.
They are so sad.

41:20.895 --> 41:26.333
It definitely feels good
to stay on top.

41:26.334 --> 41:28.835
Roshni is a small
lady with a big heart.

41:28.836 --> 41:33.002
Unfortunately, her performance
tonight matched her stature.
