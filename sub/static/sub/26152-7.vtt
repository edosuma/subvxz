00:19.130 --> 00:21.200
-I think there's a bit of a conflict of interest there.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.140
-I'm done waiting for you!

00:23.140 --> 00:25.170
I don't know that I wanna be with you anymore.

00:27.230 --> 00:30.100
-Fanta:  The share   is 50 million euros.

00:30.100 --> 00:32.220
It will be paid in diamonds.

00:32.220 --> 00:34.190
-For the first time since we landed here

00:34.190 --> 00:36.180

it looks like we raised just about enough capital

01:25.030 --> 01:26.180

our basic needs and few odds and ends,

01:45.080 --> 01:47.030
it's a miracle we found a bar with any potential.

01:48.050 --> 01:49.180
The Hills are going into business.

01:49.180 --> 01:52.020

02:09.110 --> 02:10.140

02:10.140 --> 02:12.000
-Oh, I know we talked about this.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.070
-Yeah, only a hundred times.

02:13.070 --> 02:14.180
-I just wanna be sure you're sure, Albert.

02:14.180 --> 02:16.180
-Hey, Mum's sure. Everybody's sure.

02:16.180 --> 02:18.000
You're the only one that's not sure.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.200
-To be fair, I mean, what do we know

02:19.200 --> 02:21.040
about the bar business, son?

02:21.040 --> 02:22.090
-This isn't about a bar.

-Oh. It's not?

02:23.120 --> 02:24.210
-No.

08:14.190 --> 08:17.010
Yeah. Well, listen, the fact that we didn't get black-bagged right here and now

08:17.010 --> 08:18.140
means they don't know it's us yet, all right?

08:19.080 --> 08:21.220
-Yeah. Seemed pretty confident to me, Al.

08:24.020 --> 08:25.020

08:49.190 --> 08:51.020

08:52.050 --> 08:53.140
You know, it's just these last few weeks

It's all set up for this afternoon.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.010
-Ah. So I've been thinking.

09:19.180 --> 09:22.100
I suppose the key thing in any good heist on a heist

09:22.100 --> 09:24.160
is knowing where the thief is going before he gets there.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.160
Right? -Yeah.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.100
-Hazard a guess Ortega's not feeling too confident

09:27.100 --> 09:29.000
about this fish market hideaway at the moment.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.170
-You know, he'll have to take 'em somewhere else,

09:30.170 --> 09:32.020
somewhere that we don't know about.

09:32.020 --> 09:33.070
-So it's simple then.

09:33.230 --> 09:35.060
We hit them in transit.

09:35.060 --> 09:36.170
-That sounds about right.

09:37.190 --> 09:39.150
-So, were you right, Lotti?

09:39.150 --> 09:41.000
Was I worried for nothing?

09:41.140 --> 09:43.130
-Uh, maybe not nothing.

09:44.010 --> 09:47.030
The mayor might have reason to be a little mistrustful.

09:47.030 --> 09:48.090
-Oh, no.

09:48.090 --> 09:50.060
My mother will be so embarrassed.

09:50.060 --> 09:53.010
-May I suggest you don't tell your mother?

09:53.010 --> 09:54.130
-I tell her everything.

09:54.130 --> 09:56.220
And in the proud history of my family,

09:56.220 --> 10:00.100
going back for generations, never have any Ramirez

10:00.100 --> 10:03.090
received so much as a parking violation.

10:03.090 --> 10:04.170
And look at me now.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.230
Ramiro Ramirez, an outlaw.

10:07.230 --> 10:08.200

-Hate 'Em All Henry, meet Ramiro Ramirez.

10:19.100 --> 10:20.210
He's... He's one of us.

10:22.030 --> 10:23.170
-Nice to meet you, Senor Henry.

10:23.170 --> 10:25.070
-How's he one of us?

10:25.070 --> 10:27.100
-Ramiro helped us get the fish market blueprint,

10:27.100 --> 10:29.060
and now the mayor's got a hard-on for him.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.110

Now, Lily, just hear me out now, please.

11:39.190 --> 11:42.040
I know I've been a bit distracted of late, but...

12:04.160 --> 12:07.070
-And Rico doesn't know what Snake Eyes wants him to do?

12:07.070 --> 12:09.000
-Well, if he does, he's not saying.

12:09.190 --> 12:11.040
-He must be scared.

12:11.160 --> 12:14.010
-I just keep thinking, if it wasn't for me,

12:14.010 --> 12:16.080
his old man would be here to look out for him right now.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.180
-But, Billy-- -No, uh...

12:17.180 --> 12:19.190
I'm not trying to feel sorry for myself.

12:19.190 --> 12:20.230
Now, it's my fault or not,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.210
kid's gotta face this on his own, right?

12:24.210 --> 12:26.170
-Well, maybe he shouldn't face it alone.

12:26.170 --> 12:30.000
You said it yourself, Rico needs someone right now.

12:30.170 --> 12:34.020
And I think you know why you walked into that  mercado  in the first place.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.040
And it wasn't to restock shelves.

12:37.170 --> 12:40.190
You went because you needed to find some way to help Billy.

13:59.030 --> 14:01.220
The Catalan and The Mute.

14:01.220 --> 14:04.100
What happened? You don't visit.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.230
You don't call. I thought we were supposed to be friends.

14:06.230 --> 14:08.180
-Well, we've been rather busy.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.140
Yeah, a bit of a, a bit of a tete-a-tete with the locals.

14:11.140 --> 14:13.180
-Okay, let's talk over a meal.

14:13.180 --> 14:17.020
Adela, my daughter, is making a stew that you cannot forget.

14:18.100 --> 14:22.190
Two days and two nights she prepares the stock, Raul.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.130
You like stew, The Mute?

14:29.160 --> 14:31.220
-Mm. (Albert grunts, clears throat)

14:36.200 --> 14:37.210
-So...

14:39.030 --> 14:41.120
it's not my pleasant company that brings you here today?

14:41.120 --> 14:44.070
-Ah, if wishing made it so. (chuckles)

14:44.070 --> 14:46.030
But, uh, no.

14:46.030 --> 14:49.040
No, we've got rather pressing business to attend to.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.020
-Talk to Volkov. He will listen.

14:53.110 --> 14:56.080
-Well, we-we know you're the man when it comes to guns,

14:57.030 --> 14:59.210
but can you move other merchandise, General?

15:00.130 --> 15:02.110
-I can move anything... but people.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.230
-(spits)

15:03.230 --> 15:06.130
That is dog's work.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.120
-What about diamonds?

15:13.120 --> 15:15.070
-Of course, diamonds.

15:15.070 --> 15:19.050
-Even at scale? Significant scale?

15:24.120 --> 15:26.170
-Are we talking molehill or mountain?

15:26.170 --> 15:29.130
-Mountain. About 50 million euros high.

15:29.130 --> 15:32.030
Give or take, according to market fluctuation.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.230
-That's a very niche market, Raul.

15:41.210 --> 15:45.190
I didn't lived this long without learning how to smell danger.

15:45.190 --> 15:49.150
No doubt whoever possesses these diamonds is powerful,

15:49.150 --> 15:53.030
and power means danger... to me.

15:54.080 --> 15:57.090
For a deal like this, I'm no middle man. I want a cut.

15:57.090 --> 16:00.210
-I'm sure we can come to some sort of arrangement, yeah.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.230
And in the meantime,

16:02.230 --> 16:04.190
there's another matter I'd like to discuss with you.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.180

16:18.200 --> 16:21.100

We negotiate over stew, I insist.

No pepper. It doesn't need pepper.

Ortega's probably got a carload of contract killers

18:07.070 --> 18:09.090
sitting outside your plot right now,

18:09.090 --> 18:10.170
waiting to do some target practice

18:12.070 --> 18:13.220

18:33.050 --> 18:35.160

18:37.140 --> 18:39.100
-You don't know the half of it.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.220
-You wanna tell me?

18:42.220 --> 18:43.220
-Hmm...

18:48.000 --> 18:52.020
It's my marriage. It's not at all... well.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.090
-Hmm.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.200
I was married once.

19:01.030 --> 19:04.110
Made the mistake of not digging in when it went too bad.

20:11.150 --> 20:13.070
I'm not after you. -A cop?

20:14.180 --> 20:17.150
-I was undercover in Ortega's organization

20:17.150 --> 20:18.200
before you ever showed up.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.150
I've been after him for months.

20:20.150 --> 20:22.100
-Well, was that claim about him killing your father,

20:22.100 --> 20:23.120
was that a lie as well?

20:23.120 --> 20:24.100
-No.

20:25.090 --> 20:27.190
I'm trying to give you a chance, Albert.

20:27.190 --> 20:29.170
Stop whatever you are doing

20:29.170 --> 20:33.100
because I'm not going to let anything stand in my way.

20:35.010 --> 20:36.030
-Is that a threat?

20:37.010 --> 20:38.010
-No.

20:39.010 --> 20:39.230
It's a warning.

20:55.170 --> 20:57.170
-Shoulders back and chin up.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.170
Half of dealing with these pricks

20:59.170 --> 21:01.050
is how you carry yourself.

21:03.120 --> 21:06.010
Now hold his look. I'll do the rest.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.120
-(speaking Spanish)

21:13.200 --> 21:15.130
-So you come to break bread?

21:18.170 --> 21:21.100
-Whatever debt this kid has with you is cancelled.

21:23.130 --> 21:26.100
He's not gonna roll with you, and he doesn't owe you shit.

21:26.100 --> 21:29.130
-Ain't that right? You don't owe me shit.

21:30.010 --> 21:31.040
-(speaking Spanish)

21:31.040 --> 21:33.110
-Oi. You got nothing to say to him.

21:33.110 --> 21:34.230
You have threats to make,

21:35.130 --> 21:36.130
you bring 'em to me.

21:38.220 --> 21:40.120
Don't make me come back to this shithole,

21:41.120 --> 21:42.210
'cause I'll cause chaos.

21:50.150 --> 21:51.160
-(spits)

21:53.080 --> 21:54.210
-That was badass.

21:55.180 --> 21:57.080
-Yes, it was, son. Yes, it was.

22:08.210 --> 22:10.010
-(exhales sharply)

22:10.170 --> 22:12.040
-Jeez. Who died?

22:12.040 --> 22:13.080
-Nobody died.

22:17.150 --> 22:20.030
-Al, come on, what's the matter? What happened?

22:25.180 --> 22:26.210
-You know what? Nothing.

22:26.210 --> 22:28.140
It's just a lot going on right now.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.230
I'll be all right.

22:32.190 --> 22:33.160
-Well...

22:35.020 --> 22:36.120
you know where I am if you...

22:37.160 --> 22:39.040
ever need to tell me anything.

22:41.230 --> 22:43.160
-Yeah, I do know where you are, Charlie, yeah.

22:47.150 --> 22:49.000
You know what? I'm gonna go for a walk.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.010
Right.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.040
-Albert.

23:18.110 --> 23:19.220
Mayor Ortega wants to see you.

23:19.220 --> 23:20.220
-Right now?

23:20.220 --> 23:21.220
-Now.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.060
Get in the car.

23:37.130 --> 23:38.160
-Senor Henry?

23:42.030 --> 23:43.160
-You're liable to get yourself ironed out

23:43.160 --> 23:45.180
creeping up on me like that in a suit, son.

23:46.140 --> 23:49.030
-So sorry, Senor Henry, but...

23:50.040 --> 23:52.090
I can't help noticing it looks like

23:52.090 --> 23:53.230
maybe you are going out soon.

23:55.110 --> 23:57.050
-Well, maybe I am.

23:57.050 --> 24:00.030
However, you, being the notorious wanted criminal

24:00.030 --> 24:02.160
that you are, son, are to stay put.

24:04.020 --> 24:06.090
-But you see...

24:07.170 --> 24:09.090
I really need my Pepper.

24:09.090 --> 24:11.160
-I'll get you pepper seven ways till Sunday.

24:11.160 --> 24:14.110
Please, don't worry about it. Look.

24:16.180 --> 24:17.200
-You don't understand.

24:17.200 --> 24:21.200
My Pepper is very important. I could not live without her.

24:22.090 --> 24:23.070
-Her?

24:23.220 --> 24:25.220
I thought you was talking about spices.

24:25.220 --> 24:28.190
Mate, listen, I'm not going to get your dog.

24:28.190 --> 24:32.100
-She's not a dog. She's a parrot.

24:33.160 --> 24:34.140
-Come again?

24:36.190 --> 24:39.080
Pepper is a parrot?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.220
-An African gray parrot.

24:43.050 --> 24:44.180
-An African gray.

24:47.070 --> 24:49.050
Why didn't you say that in the first place?

24:49.050 --> 24:51.060
Come on. Let's go and get her.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.210
-What are you doing?

24:59.210 --> 25:01.140
-What does it look like I'm doing?

25:01.140 --> 25:04.090
I'm leaving you and your friend, Clarence, to your own devices.

25:04.090 --> 25:05.200
-What are you talking about?

25:05.200 --> 25:08.070
-Oh, I think we both know what I'm talking about.

25:08.070 --> 25:10.070
Your little afternoon tryst.

25:12.070 --> 25:14.160
-You mean, you followed me like some bloody mark?

25:15.080 --> 25:17.120
-Yeah, and my suspicions were confirmed.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.210
-(door slams)

25:35.170 --> 25:38.080
-Another beautiful day, don't you think, Albert?

25:39.160 --> 25:42.100
-The sun always shines in San Toledo, Mr. Mayor.

25:42.100 --> 25:43.150
-Indeed it does.

25:46.210 --> 25:50.000
Yet, I find myself perturbed.

25:53.010 --> 25:53.230
-How can I help?

25:57.180 --> 25:59.170
-Do not play games with me.

26:03.050 --> 26:04.150
-I don't follow.

26:05.220 --> 26:07.160
-Listen to me carefully, Albert.

26:08.130 --> 26:10.110
I assure you your life depends on it.

26:12.060 --> 26:14.130
I know your father tried to hit my vault.

26:14.130 --> 26:19.050
We found explosive materials and we dusted for his prints.

26:19.230 --> 26:22.160
I gave him a chance and he spat on it.

26:22.160 --> 26:24.140
Now he must be dealt with.

26:26.030 --> 26:31.100
Out of respect, I will allow you to handle it.

26:33.130 --> 26:35.050
Or I will.

26:37.080 --> 26:38.190
But if I do,

26:38.190 --> 26:42.220
all of your family and friends will be buried with him.

26:43.230 --> 26:46.140
Do you understand what I'm telling you now?

26:46.140 --> 26:49.000
-Okay, let me talk to him.

26:50.090 --> 26:53.020
I will talk to him. Right?

26:54.110 --> 26:57.100
I'll send him away. -The time for talk is over!

26:59.030 --> 27:01.130
I hope you see the chance I'm giving you, Albert.

27:03.160 --> 27:05.180
You've met me at an important time.

27:05.180 --> 27:08.220
The future is bright, and if you prove your worth,

27:08.220 --> 27:11.100
you can earn a piece of it and sit at my table.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.120
Don't waste it over a ghost.

27:17.120 --> 27:19.070
Even if that ghost is your father.

27:23.070 --> 27:24.210
-I understand.

27:26.210 --> 27:27.230
I understand.

27:32.060 --> 27:33.140
What did you have in mind for me?

27:41.090 --> 27:43.190
-All will be revealed tomorrow...

27:47.190 --> 27:49.140
but for today...

27:51.030 --> 27:52.140
your answer, Albert.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.060
Can I count on you for what I ask?

27:59.130 --> 28:01.130
-(line ringing)

28:02.040 --> 28:04.070
-Charlie (on phone):  Al?  -Charlie, we're in trouble.

28:04.070 --> 28:06.200
The mayor knows it was Vic   that tried to blow his vault.

28:06.200 --> 28:09.160
Yeah, and he wants his head, and he wants me to take it.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.220
-That's a bit strong, isn't it?

28:10.220 --> 28:12.150
-He's hinted at putting me on a big job tomorrow.

28:12.150 --> 28:14.070
It's the Garcia heist, okay? I know it is.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.150
-What do you wanna do, Al?

28:16.150 --> 28:18.080
-I don't know, okay?

28:18.080 --> 28:20.180
But he was crystal clear, Charlie, crystal.

28:20.180 --> 28:23.030
It's either Vic or all of us.

28:49.050 --> 28:51.130
-Something's going on, I can tell.

28:59.230 --> 29:01.140
How bad is it?

29:03.140 --> 29:05.070
-It's not good.

29:07.020 --> 29:08.150
-Is it Vic?

29:10.100 --> 29:11.190
-I'm trying to protect him, Mum,

29:11.190 --> 29:13.150
but he's not giving me much choice.

29:16.050 --> 29:17.160
-What are you gonna do?

29:20.190 --> 29:22.110
-I'm gonna do what needs to be done.

29:45.100 --> 29:46.180
-Billy.

29:46.180 --> 29:48.220
-Rico, look at me.

29:50.100 --> 29:52.130
You're gonna be fine, okay?

29:52.130 --> 29:54.040
-Snake Eyes: You sure about that, Billy, huh?

29:54.040 --> 29:55.210
You just made more problems for the kid.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.140
-Why are they doing this, Billy?

29:58.140 --> 30:00.160
-Billy: Relax, Gloria.

30:01.230 --> 30:02.210
No problema.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.150
We'll be, uh, we'll be back playing dominoes in no time.

30:11.170 --> 30:14.000
-There's got to be another way, Albert.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.110
This is your father we're talking about.

30:22.220 --> 30:24.140
-Hmm.

30:24.140 --> 30:27.200
H4 to Z1.

30:28.210 --> 30:31.180
Check mate. Boom.

30:31.180 --> 30:34.080

30:34.080 --> 30:36.150

30:50.230 --> 30:52.040
Yes, Albert?

30:52.040 --> 30:53.050
-Dad, we need to talk.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.020
-It's your mother you need to talk to, not me.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.210
-This has got nothing to do with Mum. Where are ya?

30:58.170 --> 30:59.160
-(sighs)

31:00.110 --> 31:01.080
(groans)

31:02.210 --> 31:04.090
-We've got a problem.

31:07.030 --> 31:09.040
It needs immediate attention and you are front and center.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.090
-(sighs) Not now.

31:11.090 --> 31:13.000
I've got bigger things going on.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
-This is about more than just you, Dad.

31:15.170 --> 31:17.070
For once, just pull your head out of your ass

31:17.070 --> 31:19.040
and try and see there's a bigger picture going on here.

31:19.040 --> 31:20.120
-Oh, well, look who woke up

31:20.120 --> 31:22.080
and put their big boy pants on today.

31:22.080 --> 31:24.010
-Are you quite finished?

31:24.010 --> 31:26.080
-I'm not worried about your mate Ortega.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.100
-Good 'cause it's not him you need to be worried about.

31:33.030 --> 31:34.120
It's me.

31:44.220 --> 31:47.150
-Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown, Albert.

31:48.120 --> 31:50.070
-It's the only way to keep everyone safe.

31:52.030 --> 31:53.080
-You know, it's funny.

31:55.150 --> 31:58.020
Looking at you right now, tonight of all nights,

31:59.220 --> 32:02.110
I don't think you've ever looked more like your father.

32:14.060 --> 32:15.180
-Did you tell Rico, hmm?

32:16.110 --> 32:19.100
And his sweet  abuela  who you really are, hmm?

32:20.090 --> 32:22.050
The great English hope.

32:22.050 --> 32:24.000
-Listen, you don't wanna do that.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.050
-Hey, Rico...

32:26.120 --> 32:28.060
you know who this  hombre  really is, huh?

32:28.060 --> 32:30.160
Your big, tough hero, hmm?

32:31.160 --> 32:33.020
-What is he talking about, Billy?

32:34.020 --> 32:35.110
-Listen, Rico...

32:36.090 --> 32:38.050
I was gonna tell you. -Tell me what?

32:38.050 --> 32:39.070
-Snake Eyes (laughs): Oh, man.

32:39.070 --> 32:41.010
This is tragic, huh?

32:41.010 --> 32:43.130
You think this bitch is looking out for you, Rico, huh?

32:43.130 --> 32:45.140
This is Billy Ayres,

32:45.140 --> 32:47.120
the fighter that put your  papi  in a coma.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.110
-Billy.

32:57.030 --> 32:58.030
-I'm sorry.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.120
-Come see me tomorrow, yeah?

33:08.090 --> 33:10.080
Or I'm gonna light this place with a match.

33:11.110 --> 33:12.210
(laughs)

33:14.070 --> 33:15.060
Let's go.

33:26.140 --> 33:29.210
-Billy, please... leave.

33:45.210 --> 33:48.130
-So you've had a chance to consider my proposition?

33:49.120 --> 33:52.020
-For the sake of my mother and my friends,

33:52.020 --> 33:53.100
I will stand with you.

33:54.120 --> 33:56.130
-And you understand the condition I've set?

33:57.020 --> 33:59.080
-I will handle my father.

34:00.020 --> 34:01.180
But first I need to know what I'm getting into

34:01.180 --> 34:03.010
and what I'm getting out of it.

34:09.120 --> 34:11.010
I will be a lot more effective to you

34:11.010 --> 34:12.210
if you tell me what I'm supposed to be doing.

34:12.210 --> 34:15.050
-You'll know all you need to know tomorrow.

34:15.050 --> 34:17.200
Today you have other business to worry about.
