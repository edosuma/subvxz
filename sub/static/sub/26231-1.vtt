00:20.411 --> 00:22.433
Ben, were there
any packages for me?

00:22.457 --> 00:25.740
No. Sir... the woman

00:25.764 --> 00:28.550
over there claims she's your...
Jake!

00:35.426 --> 00:37.622
Mom, what the hell
are you doing here?

00:37.646 --> 00:39.996
I need to talk to you. You're
not taking any of my calls.

00:44.435 --> 00:46.785
I didn't get any.
Why don't you come up?

00:49.527 --> 00:52.158
I told you to never come here!
Please...

00:52.182 --> 00:54.117
Don't be mad. I had to!

00:54.141 --> 00:56.119
Your father is very sick.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.773
He's been in pain for weeks,
and unless we can come up with

00:58.797 --> 01:01.689
the money for his treatment...
"Pain"? Good.

01:01.713 --> 01:04.126
I guess my prayers
have finally been answered.

01:04.150 --> 01:06.303
Jake!
I hope it's unbearable.

01:06.327 --> 01:08.740
Please! You don't mean that.

01:08.764 --> 01:10.916
I know that in the past,

01:10.940 --> 01:13.136
you and your father haven't
been able to see eye-to-eye...

01:13.160 --> 01:16.052
You're really something,
aren't you?

01:16.076 --> 01:19.316
You're right. We didn't see
eye-to-eye. How could we when I

01:19.340 --> 01:21.274
was getting the shit kicked out
of me at 5 years old?!

01:21.298 --> 01:23.581
He admits that he's
made mistakes.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.583
Making a 10-year-old
sit in scalding hot water

01:25.607 --> 01:27.889
FOR SPILLING JUICE ON THE FLOOR
IS NOT A MISTAKE!

01:27.913 --> 01:29.978
That is evil.

01:30.002 --> 01:31.893
And you sat right there

01:31.917 --> 01:33.634
and you watched him do it.

01:43.015 --> 01:44.819
You do not sit on my furniture.

01:44.843 --> 01:47.735
You sit on the floor.

01:47.759 --> 01:50.284
Sit on the floor!

01:58.205 --> 02:01.208
What's he have?

02:03.035 --> 02:04.970
He's got cancer.

02:04.994 --> 02:08.495
Oh, I can see him
rolling around in agony.

02:08.519 --> 02:10.584
I... I promise you

02:10.608 --> 02:12.543
that if you could
just loan us the money,

02:12.567 --> 02:14.588
then... then...
then we'll pay it back!

02:14.612 --> 02:17.287
Oh, so it would be a loan?

02:17.311 --> 02:19.463
Yeah, we'll pay...
we'll pay it back.

02:19.487 --> 02:21.465
You know, you didn't try
very hard to give me a loan

02:21.489 --> 02:23.293
when I wanted to go to college.
Come on! That was different!

02:23.317 --> 02:25.643
You didn't try at all.
It was different! You didn't

02:25.667 --> 02:28.211
need college. Look at you.
Look at this place!

02:28.235 --> 02:30.082
You designed an app and you

02:30.106 --> 02:33.520
sold it and you're this...
this millionaire at 18.

02:33.544 --> 02:36.306
You're right. I made
$1 million off of that app,

02:36.330 --> 02:39.265
and I've made
about 6 million since.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.702
And I would rather

02:41.726 --> 02:44.966
throw $100000

02:44.990 --> 02:46.707
into that fireplace
and watch it burn

02:46.731 --> 02:50.082
before I gave you
and Dad a penny of it.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.758
I hope that Dad

02:53.782 --> 02:55.934
dies a long... slow...

02:55.958 --> 02:59.198
painful death.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.902
Now, get the hell out
of my apartment.

03:07.926 --> 03:10.078
And if you ever,

03:10.102 --> 03:13.517
ever show up here
out of the blue like that again,

03:13.541 --> 03:15.345
I cannot tell you

03:15.369 --> 03:17.216
how much you're
gonna regret that decision.

That was so fun, right?

04:42.847 --> 04:45.261
How many guys do you
think live in Philadelphia?

04:45.285 --> 04:47.437
I don't know.
Like, a million. Why?

04:47.461 --> 04:49.308
A million guys to choose
from and you feel the need

04:49.332 --> 04:52.355
to screw my ex?
What are you talking about?

04:52.379 --> 04:54.922
Go to hell.

04:54.946 --> 04:57.098
Maddie!

04:57.122 --> 04:58.796
Seriously, I don't even know
why he's texting me!

04:58.820 --> 05:02.040
What's going on?

05:06.784 --> 05:09.285
Maddie!

05:09.309 --> 05:12.766
Maddie, I'm talking to you!
Don't touch me!

05:12.790 --> 05:15.029
I don't wanna hear anything
you have to say.

05:15.053 --> 05:17.336
Stop accusing me of something
that I didn't even do!

05:17.360 --> 05:19.686
Don't walk away from me,
you stupid bitch!

05:19.710 --> 05:22.907
I'm talking to you!
You're a psycho! You're the psycho!

05:22.931 --> 05:24.822
You're the one that's jumping to
idiotic conclusions that aren't

05:24.846 --> 05:27.433
even true, and why are you
looking at my phone anyway?

05:27.457 --> 05:30.262
Take a pill, Brooke. I've had
enough of this. I'm leaving.

05:30.286 --> 05:33.768
What going on over there?
I got it. It's okay. I got it.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.165
Hey, are you okay?

05:43.386 --> 05:45.364
No.
Just take a deep breath.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.192
You're fine.

05:47.216 --> 05:50.108
How about I get you a drink?

05:50.132 --> 05:51.936
I'm not 21 yet.

05:51.960 --> 05:55.093
Well, neither am I.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.819
All right. So, Brooke,
tell me about yourself.

06:05.843 --> 06:09.823
Um... Not much to tell.
Come on.

06:09.847 --> 06:13.261
Um... I'm a senior
at Bellamy High.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.699
I'm a cheerleader.

06:15.723 --> 06:18.876
I live with my mom.
She has a boyfriend named Alex.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.487
Hmm. Okay.
Hey!

06:21.511 --> 06:23.315
Hey!

06:23.339 --> 06:25.883
This is Jake.
I literally just met him.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.885
This is Keisha,
my friend from school.

06:27.909 --> 06:29.887
Pleasure. Jake.

06:29.911 --> 06:32.890
Um... Everybody's
calling it a night.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.959
Are you gonna stay?

06:37.092 --> 06:40.811
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
hang around for a bit longer.

06:40.835 --> 06:42.987
Are you sure?

06:43.011 --> 06:44.989
Yes. I'll see you at school.

06:45.013 --> 06:47.078
Okay.

06:47.102 --> 06:49.776
Text me.

06:49.800 --> 06:53.040
I think she's worried about you.

06:53.064 --> 06:55.129
Should she be?

06:55.153 --> 06:57.218
I don't think so.
I'm a pretty decent guy.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.612
I consider myself a gentleman.

06:59.636 --> 07:02.006
You know, most guys
from Kansas probably do.

07:02.030 --> 07:05.401
Kansas? That is so random.
Yeah.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.533
What brought you
out to Pennsylvania?

07:07.557 --> 07:10.473
Ah, it's a long story.
I've got time.

07:12.954 --> 07:15.019
Okay. Well...

07:15.043 --> 07:18.196
I bailed out of my parents'
house when I was 17

07:18.220 --> 07:19.980
and moved up here, I don't know,

07:20.004 --> 07:22.026
a couple of years ago.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.724
And then I created an app.
Sold it.

07:24.748 --> 07:27.597
Made enough money to live on
the rest of my life.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.947
Wow!

07:29.971 --> 07:32.166
Why did you leave
your parents' house?

07:32.190 --> 07:34.821
Uh...
Go.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.780
Got a bottle

07:36.804 --> 07:39.086
of our best champagne
and two glasses.

07:39.110 --> 07:41.199
My man. Do you know what?
Just throw it on my tab.

07:42.984 --> 07:45.571
You know what? Cheers.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.660
<i>♪ He turns away</i>

07:47.684 --> 07:49.706

07:49.730 --> 07:52.360
<i>♪ Baby, can you read my mind? ♪</i>

07:52.384 --> 07:54.406
Okay, so you gotta tell me

07:54.430 --> 07:57.017
what happened between you and
your friend, because honestly,

07:57.041 --> 07:59.193
I thought you were about to
break out the boxing gloves.

07:59.217 --> 08:01.631
I mean, what could she have
done, sleep with your boyfriend?

08:01.655 --> 08:04.092
No.
Wrecked your car?

08:06.050 --> 08:08.551
Her ex texted me
and now, she thinks

08:08.575 --> 08:11.641
that I'm trying to get with him,
but I would never do that.

08:11.665 --> 08:13.643
Oh, okay. So, you just
really don't like

08:13.667 --> 08:15.538
being accused of things
that you didn't do?

08:18.889 --> 08:20.867
No.

08:20.891 --> 08:23.217
I have this...

08:23.241 --> 08:25.568
condition...

08:25.592 --> 08:27.961
that I have to take pills for,

08:27.985 --> 08:31.399
and the doctors haven't quite
got the dosage right yet.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.270
Well, does this...

08:33.294 --> 08:36.037
condition have a name?

08:39.126 --> 08:41.018
It's called...

08:41.042 --> 08:43.716
intermittent explosive
disorder, IED.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.718
I go into these...

08:45.742 --> 08:47.614
rages, and it can
get pretty crazy.

08:51.618 --> 08:54.597
Is this your car?
Yeah.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.686
All right. Hop in.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.601
Let's go.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.516
And on the way,
you can tell me the rest

09:00.540 --> 09:02.585
of that story.

09:04.631 --> 09:08.175
Wow. That's crazy. So it
happened during cheerleading?

09:08.199 --> 09:11.289
Yeah. I hit my head
pretty hard.

09:13.204 --> 09:15.293
Brooke!

09:18.079 --> 09:21.319
Brooke? Call 911!

09:21.343 --> 09:23.800
They said that when I hit
my head, it started slowing down

09:23.824 --> 09:26.672
the production
of serotonin. It's a...

09:26.696 --> 09:28.848
I know what it does.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.937
It regulates
your impulse control.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.897
How did you know that?

09:33.921 --> 09:36.445
I'm smarter than I look.

09:38.403 --> 09:40.991
So, do you take
any medication for it?

09:41.015 --> 09:44.168
Yup... which I am not
supposed to be drinking on.

09:44.192 --> 09:46.170
Which neither one of us
should be drinking,

09:46.194 --> 09:48.128
since, you know, we're not 21.

09:48.152 --> 09:50.043
True.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.698
Look, I'm pretty much
the same way. I fly off

09:52.722 --> 09:54.657
the handle sometimes,

09:54.681 --> 09:56.615
and I say some
pretty nasty things.

09:56.639 --> 09:58.486
Mm-hmm...

09:58.510 --> 10:00.445
You do realize we sound

10:00.469 --> 10:03.709
like a couple
of jerks right now?

10:03.733 --> 10:06.233
Yeah, to the people
that don't know us, but...

10:06.257 --> 10:09.826
I get the sense you can
be really sweet too.

10:11.654 --> 10:14.198
Maybe.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.679
I think this is the part

10:16.703 --> 10:18.724
where I'm supposed
to ask you on a real date.

10:18.748 --> 10:21.901
Really?! After what I
just told you?

10:21.925 --> 10:23.816
Come on, that doesn't scare me.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.669
Okay. Give me your phone.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.161
But wait! Wait.

10:49.039 --> 10:51.148
A gentleman!

10:51.172 --> 10:53.087
Always.

10:57.265 --> 10:59.876
So... I'll call you tomorrow.

11:02.096 --> 11:04.098
Goodnight.

11:13.716 --> 11:16.739
Brooke Emerson.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.393
Wow.

11:19.417 --> 11:23.073
Who was that guy?

11:25.249 --> 11:27.750
Were you spying on me?

11:27.774 --> 11:29.534
No, I heard his car.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.449
And besides, it's half an hour
past your curfew.

11:31.473 --> 11:34.321
Why didn't Maddie
bring you home?

11:34.345 --> 11:37.542
Maddie decided to leave early.

11:37.566 --> 11:40.893
Did you meet that guy tonight?

11:40.917 --> 11:43.243
He's Keisha's friend.
What's the big deal?

11:43.267 --> 11:46.725
Well, how old is he?
I don't know! Like 18.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.727
18?! What kind of 18-year-old

11:48.751 --> 11:50.686
drives around
in a $100000 sports car?

11:50.710 --> 11:53.297
Rich ones! Oh, my God! Enough!

11:53.321 --> 11:55.995
Like, stop!

11:56.019 --> 11:58.519
Look, I'm telling you, man,

11:58.543 --> 12:01.261
it's like this girl,
she is something special.

12:01.285 --> 12:03.786
Yeah. She is so...
just... different

12:03.810 --> 12:06.049
from anybody that I've ever met.
Oh, yeah?

12:06.073 --> 12:08.051
How so?
It's just...

12:08.075 --> 12:10.270
It's like, I get her.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.533
She gets me. It's like
I've filled in that piece

12:12.557 --> 12:14.579
that's... that's
always been missing.

12:14.603 --> 12:16.624
It's like...

12:16.648 --> 12:18.452
I feel like I belong,
and it's just,

12:18.476 --> 12:20.324
I've got the right person

12:20.348 --> 12:22.543
at the right time. It's just...

12:22.567 --> 12:24.807
Wow.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.678
"Sufferers experience hostility,

12:26.702 --> 12:29.183
aggressive outbursts
and sudden episodes of anger."

12:31.315 --> 12:33.250
They don't understand you,
Brooke.

12:33.274 --> 12:35.382
No one does.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.602
But I do.

12:40.281 --> 12:42.326
I know exactly how you feel.

13:05.219 --> 13:07.545
Hey, girl.
Hey.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.939
You know that black dress you
wore to the club that one night?

13:09.963 --> 13:11.854
Could I borrow it?
Where is he taking you?

13:11.878 --> 13:13.856
Wally's on Main.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.945
Holy crap!
I know, right?!

13:15.969 --> 13:18.686
Okay, yes. I will bring you
that dress tomorrow night.

13:18.710 --> 13:21.365
Thank you.
Bye.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.928
What's up, Alex?
What are you guys doing?

13:42.952 --> 13:44.974
Oh, desperately trying
to make sense

13:44.998 --> 13:47.324
of these instructions.
It's a new chair

13:47.348 --> 13:50.501
for your room.
Oh! Well, that's nice.

13:50.525 --> 13:53.896
Good luck with your project.
What time will you

13:53.920 --> 13:55.898
be back tonight?
Uh...

13:55.922 --> 13:59.075
We'll probably hang out after,
so... like midnight?

13:59.099 --> 14:00.946
Not a minute after.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.972
Please.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.825

14:09.849 --> 14:11.957

14:21.164 --> 14:24.100

<i>♪ Na, Na, Na, Na, Na ♪</i>

14:47.451 --> 14:50.778
Okay, what do you think

14:50.802 --> 14:52.892
of this one?

14:54.937 --> 14:57.287
I think we should fly to Paris
this weekend and buy it.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.460
Wow.

15:20.484 --> 15:23.835
You look... incredible.

15:38.459 --> 15:41.786
You were right. It's bigger
than the one she broke.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.701
Hmm.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.877
I don't think it's helping.

15:45.901 --> 15:48.053
It takes time to figure out.

15:48.077 --> 15:50.490
Didn't her therapist
say different things

15:50.514 --> 15:52.318
work for different people?

15:52.342 --> 15:54.755
Yeah, but it's not fair.

15:54.779 --> 15:57.043
Why'd this have
to happen to her?

15:59.045 --> 16:00.631
There are days that she
doesn't even seem like

16:00.655 --> 16:02.589
the same daughter
that I used to have.

16:02.613 --> 16:05.592
Hey... it's not just the IED.

16:05.616 --> 16:08.030
She's a teenager.
If you could've seen

16:08.054 --> 16:10.534
how difficult
Joey was at times...

16:13.015 --> 16:14.819
Hey.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.952
She's a good kid,

16:16.976 --> 16:19.215
and you're a great mom.
Hmm.

16:19.239 --> 16:21.023
She'll get past this.

16:25.593 --> 16:27.595
Thank you.

16:30.946 --> 16:32.924
So...

16:32.948 --> 16:35.448
What type of girls
do you usually see?

16:35.472 --> 16:38.103
The kind that I only date once.

16:38.127 --> 16:41.411
It's been really tough to find
people that I connect with.

16:41.435 --> 16:44.525
Hmm. I can feel that.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.592
I think I get you, though.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.334
Oh, you definitely do.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.577
I knew that the second
I started talking to you.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.081
Well, on that note, I'm gonna

16:59.105 --> 17:01.020
excuse myself to the bathroom.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.441
Yeah, but... you and Brooke
have been best friends

17:11.464 --> 17:13.747
since like, junior high.
So what?

17:13.771 --> 17:15.967
I'm sick of her craziness.

17:15.991 --> 17:18.079
It's not like Brooke
asked for that head injury.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.843
He's always liked her, you know?

17:22.867 --> 17:25.585
Who? Tryg?
I used to catch him

17:25.608 --> 17:27.805
checking her out all the time.
We fought about it a few times.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.850
Look, that sounds
like it's on Tryg,

17:29.874 --> 17:32.636
not Brooke. She'd never stab you
in the back like that.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.813
Maybe she wouldn't,
maybe she would.

17:35.837 --> 17:38.120
Maddie, come on!

17:38.144 --> 17:39.947
What?

17:39.971 --> 17:42.037
Thanks for helping me
with this homework, by the way.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.169
Yeah.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.456
No problem.

17:49.764 --> 17:52.221
Hey, Brooke.

17:52.245 --> 17:55.137
Hey... Tryg.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.313
I hit you up the other night.
Did you get my text?

17:57.337 --> 17:59.576
Yeah, I did.
Did you need something?

17:59.600 --> 18:01.752
I just wanted to see
what you were up to

18:01.776 --> 18:04.146
and I thought maybe we could,
I don't know, hang out?

18:04.170 --> 18:06.235
Is everything all right here?

18:06.259 --> 18:09.368
Yeah. It's cool, man.
We go to school together.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.370
Hmm. Well...

18:11.394 --> 18:14.112
we're on this thing
called a date, so maybe save

18:14.136 --> 18:16.201
the chitchat
for between classes.

18:16.225 --> 18:19.248
Seriously, dude.
We're trying to have dinner.

18:19.272 --> 18:21.989
Yeah. My bad.

18:22.013 --> 18:24.079
I'll just talk
to you tomorrow, Brooke.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.081
Yeah.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.779
Who was that guy?

18:28.803 --> 18:30.824
That was Tryg, Maddie's ex.
I didn't know he worked here.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.739
The girl that you fought with?

18:32.763 --> 18:35.438
Yeah, it was over him!
He texted me saying,

18:35.462 --> 18:37.527
"Hey, gorgeous." And she saw it.
I don't even know

18:37.551 --> 18:39.659
why he did that.
We don't even talk.

18:39.683 --> 18:42.358
Let's forget about him,

18:42.382 --> 18:44.514
and let's get some dessert.
All right?

18:49.345 --> 18:51.280
Thanks for accepting

18:51.304 --> 18:53.804
my invitation tonight.
This is probably the best date

18:53.828 --> 18:55.849
I've ever been on.

19:29.603 --> 19:32.147
Jake... Jake... Jake.

19:34.564 --> 19:37.587
Wow.

20:09.860 --> 20:13.492
Will access the vehicle's computer

20:13.516 --> 20:19.522
"and bypass the door locks.
Will cost 58.99."

20:22.177 --> 20:24.199
One, two, three!

20:24.223 --> 20:26.113
Let's go Sharks!

20:26.137 --> 20:28.333
Nice job today, guys.
Woo!

20:28.357 --> 20:30.359
Same time tomorrow.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.260
What the hell?!

20:59.214 --> 21:01.105
Please, don't tell me
to go away.

21:01.129 --> 21:04.369
I'm sorry for blowing up at you

21:04.393 --> 21:07.677
at karaoke, but there's nothing
going on with me and Tryg.

21:07.701 --> 21:09.635
I promise, I would never
do that to you.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.594
I guess you didn't hear.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.900
Tryg was assaulted

21:13.924 --> 21:16.033
and robbed last night
as he was leaving his job.

21:16.057 --> 21:18.973
What?!

21:20.801 --> 21:23.432
That's horrible. If there's
anything I can do...

21:23.456 --> 21:25.825
Maybe you need
to up your medication.

21:25.849 --> 21:28.896
Seriously.

21:36.469 --> 21:39.709
Brooke.
Jake...

21:39.733 --> 21:43.278
What are you doing here?

21:43.302 --> 21:46.019
You didn't respond
to any of my calls.

21:46.043 --> 21:48.631
Yeah, I've been
at practice since 7:30.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.633
How did you get on campus?

21:50.657 --> 21:53.050
I must look like a student
'cause I just walked right in.

21:55.009 --> 21:57.466
Look, I'm not trying to bug you
or anything, I just...

21:57.490 --> 21:59.424
when I didn't hear back
from you, I wanted

21:59.448 --> 22:01.383
to make sure everything was okay.

22:01.407 --> 22:03.863
Yeah, everything's fine.
I just can't answer you back

22:03.887 --> 22:06.126
when I'm at school.
Yeah, but I mean, come on.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.390
A quick text?
How long does that take?

22:08.414 --> 22:11.001
I would've answered
you eventually.

22:11.025 --> 22:13.699
When?

22:13.723 --> 22:16.267
When I have time.

22:16.291 --> 22:18.400
So this is a game
to you? You wanna

22:18.424 --> 22:21.185
keep me by the phone waiting,
wondering if you're pissed off or not,

22:21.209 --> 22:23.535
trying to be the one in control?
No! Not at all. This is

22:23.559 --> 22:26.103
me having a life.
I should've seen this coming.

22:26.127 --> 22:28.932
You are like every other girl!
You want me there to pay

22:28.956 --> 22:31.282
for a nice night out,
but then you wanna just respond

22:31.306 --> 22:33.676
when you have time?
What are you talking about?!

22:33.700 --> 22:36.026
You're the one who called me
four times in an hour!

22:36.050 --> 22:38.289
That's obsessive.
That's a relationship, Brooke!

22:38.313 --> 22:40.117
And if you don't know
how those work, then stay out

22:40.141 --> 22:42.424
of them until you grow up!
Brooke?

22:42.448 --> 22:45.165
Is everything okay here?

22:45.189 --> 22:48.279
It's whatever you want.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.239
"I'm sorry for upsetting you.

23:15.263 --> 23:17.284
"I really did come by
because I was worried about you.

23:17.308 --> 23:19.156
Please call me. Love, Jake."

23:37.285 --> 23:39.481
Hey.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.352
Hi.

23:41.376 --> 23:44.790
You got my card?
Yup. I did.

23:44.814 --> 23:46.705
I'm really sorry.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.751
I was just worried is all.

23:48.775 --> 23:50.579
Jake, you said some really
mean things to me today:

23:50.603 --> 23:52.494
That I was playing games
with you, and that I'm only

23:52.518 --> 23:54.844
with you for your money.
I know.

23:54.868 --> 23:57.107
I know, and I'm...
I'm really sorry

23:57.131 --> 23:59.849
about that too. I really didn't
mean any of it. I was just...

23:59.873 --> 24:03.026
I was just upset is all.

24:03.050 --> 24:04.331
Look, if that's
what you think of me...

24:04.355 --> 24:06.159
I don't. Brooke, please.

24:06.183 --> 24:08.771
I say things that I don't mean
when I'm angry.

24:08.795 --> 24:11.600
I mean, you of all people
should understand.

24:11.624 --> 24:14.864
Just please give me

24:14.888 --> 24:16.996
a second chance. I really don't
think that anything's happened

24:17.020 --> 24:19.153
that we can't work through.

24:22.156 --> 24:24.351
Okay.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.615
I need to think about it.

24:26.639 --> 24:29.444
I'll call you later.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.122
Okay.

25:44.630 --> 25:47.347
Can I help you?
You're Brooke's mom?

25:47.371 --> 25:49.349
I am, and you are...

25:49.373 --> 25:52.265
I'm Jake.
Oh. Jake. Hi.

25:52.289 --> 25:55.617
Nice to meet you. Come on in.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.444
Thank you.

25:57.468 --> 26:00.578
You're Keisha's friend, right?
Jake?

26:00.602 --> 26:03.581
What are you doing here?

26:03.605 --> 26:06.216
I just wanted
to bring these by for you.

26:09.176 --> 26:12.503
Thanks.
Well, I think

26:12.527 --> 26:14.244
my dinner's going to burn, so I

26:14.268 --> 26:16.159
better get back to the kitchen.
Of course.

26:16.183 --> 26:18.901
Whatever you're having
smells really good.

26:18.925 --> 26:21.207
Oh, it's just pasta.

26:21.231 --> 26:23.166
It was nice
to meet you, Ms. Emerson.

26:23.190 --> 26:25.148
You too.

26:27.150 --> 26:29.868
Are you pissed that I
brought you flowers?

26:29.892 --> 26:32.218
No, I'm pissed
that you showed up here

26:32.242 --> 26:34.220
without calling me first.

26:34.244 --> 26:36.222
I just can't seem
to do anything right today.

26:36.246 --> 26:38.834
I figured it would
be a really nice surprise

26:38.858 --> 26:41.338
since I screwed up
so royally this morning.

26:43.906 --> 26:45.275
Should I just take the flowers,
and let's pretend

26:45.299 --> 26:47.364
this never happened?
No.

26:47.388 --> 26:49.975
No, I like the flowers.
I'm gonna keep them.

26:49.999 --> 26:51.977
All right. Well...

26:52.001 --> 26:54.110
I'll go so you guys can eat.

26:54.134 --> 26:55.938
Goodnight.

26:55.962 --> 26:58.810
Wait.

26:58.834 --> 27:01.987
Have you eaten yet?

27:02.011 --> 27:04.033
It's been so long since I've
had a home-cooked meal.

27:04.057 --> 27:06.078
Did your mother work a lot?

27:06.102 --> 27:08.080
She did when I was growing up,

27:08.104 --> 27:10.082
but when I sold the app,
I gave most of my money

27:10.106 --> 27:11.910
to my parents,
so they could retire early.

27:11.934 --> 27:14.347
Well, that's sweet.
Well, they worked hard

27:14.371 --> 27:16.219
to raise me, so it was
the least that I could do.

27:16.243 --> 27:18.680
Hmm.

27:21.944 --> 27:24.468
Well, I think your mom
really likes me.

27:26.383 --> 27:29.101
Why'd you say that stuff about
your parents? It's not true.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.190
Well, I figured it'd

27:31.214 --> 27:33.192
be a lot better than stories
about how they locked me

27:33.216 --> 27:35.455
in the closet, don't you think?
It'd kind of

27:35.479 --> 27:38.633
put a damper on dinner.
The reason why I

27:38.657 --> 27:40.591
brought you the flowers
is I just,

27:40.615 --> 27:43.289
I wanted to see you. I wanted
to talk you out of dumping me.

27:43.313 --> 27:45.727
I'm not dumping you.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.554
Phew! Good,

27:47.578 --> 27:49.363
because I was working on an app
to keep you from doing that.

27:51.234 --> 27:53.256
Go home.
Could I see you on Saturday?

27:53.280 --> 27:56.085
I'm going to a party that night.

27:56.109 --> 27:58.000
Oh.

27:58.024 --> 27:59.828
I like parties.

27:59.852 --> 28:01.656
Is it with people
from your school?

28:01.680 --> 28:04.310
No. It'll be like,
a bunch of different people.

28:04.334 --> 28:07.792
It's at that guy Riley's house,
the one who intervened at school.

28:07.816 --> 28:11.274
Well, I kind of owe him
an apology anyways.

28:11.298 --> 28:14.277
So if I promise

28:14.301 --> 28:16.956
to behave, can I come?

28:19.262 --> 28:21.264
Yeah, I guess.

28:29.882 --> 28:32.295
All right.
Goodnight, gorgeous.

28:32.319 --> 28:34.210
I promise

28:34.234 --> 28:36.212
I'm not gonna let you down.

28:40.806 --> 28:43.480
So...

28:43.504 --> 28:46.744
He's nice. I like him.

28:46.768 --> 28:49.486
You do?
Yeah, he's...

28:49.510 --> 28:52.097
Well, he's smart. He's polite,

28:52.121 --> 28:54.883
successful, cute.

28:54.907 --> 28:57.126
Gosh, what is there not to like?

29:01.478 --> 29:03.524
Unless there's something more
about him I should know...

29:06.266 --> 29:08.287
No.

29:08.311 --> 29:10.923
I think he's a good guy.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.366
All right, it's ready.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.740
Are we ready to eat?

33:03.764 --> 33:05.829
You hungry?

33:05.853 --> 33:07.768
We're starving!

33:14.514 --> 33:16.448
Good morning.

33:16.472 --> 33:18.953
Oh. Thank you, Brooke.

33:20.911 --> 33:22.802
Can I spend the night
at Keisha's tonight?

33:22.826 --> 33:24.587
Hmm.

33:24.611 --> 33:26.893
You're not really spending
the night with Jake, are you?

33:26.917 --> 33:29.070
No! I swear on my life!

33:29.094 --> 33:31.942
I think he's more into me
than I'm into him.

33:31.966 --> 33:34.684
Really? He seems so nice.

33:34.708 --> 33:37.643
Did something happen
between the two of you?

33:37.667 --> 33:39.887
No, nothing specific.

33:42.150 --> 33:44.955
So? About that sleepover?

33:44.979 --> 33:48.306
Okay. Fine.

34:19.534 --> 34:21.600
Hey man, look.

34:21.623 --> 34:24.255
Honestly, I just, I know it must
have looked weird the other day

34:24.279 --> 34:26.431
when I showed up at the school,
so I just wanted to apologize.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.911
You don't have
to apologize to me, man.

34:28.936 --> 34:31.654
As long as Brooke's okay, so am I.

34:31.678 --> 34:33.612
She is.

34:33.636 --> 34:35.614
Maddie's here with Tryg.

34:35.638 --> 34:39.139
She seems okay, but I can't
believe she went back to him.

34:39.164 --> 34:41.533
Do you think it's a pity thing?

34:41.556 --> 34:44.536
No. Good for them.

34:44.560 --> 34:47.061
Okay...
Shot?

34:47.085 --> 34:48.888
Thanks.

34:48.911 --> 34:51.500
Goodbye.

34:56.659 --> 34:59.160
Okay... does anyone
want any more drinks?

34:59.184 --> 35:01.553
Um, no. I think
I've had enough.

35:01.577 --> 35:03.512
I think maybe you should

35:03.536 --> 35:06.254
slow down too. I thought...

35:06.278 --> 35:08.125
I thought you weren't
even supposed

35:08.149 --> 35:09.953
to drink while you're
on those pills.

35:09.977 --> 35:12.521
No! I am so fine.
I just want water,

35:12.545 --> 35:14.566
and I didn't take the pills.
Let me just go get it for you.

35:14.590 --> 35:18.048
No! You stay. Stay. I'm going.

35:18.072 --> 35:21.031
Goodbye. I'm out.

35:31.955 --> 35:34.393
Hey.

35:36.743 --> 35:39.243
Hey. That's really messed up,

35:39.267 --> 35:41.245
what happened to you.
Are you okay?

35:41.269 --> 35:43.769
Yeah, I'll be fine
in a month or two.

35:43.793 --> 35:46.903
Can I talk to you about Maddie?

35:46.927 --> 35:50.602
Honestly, whatever's going on between
the two of you, just keep it your business.

35:50.626 --> 35:52.387
Like, she's not even
talking to me right now.

35:52.411 --> 35:54.389
All I'm saying is if...

35:54.413 --> 35:56.217
you told me today that you
wanted to give it a shot

35:56.241 --> 35:58.436
with me, I would dump her
in a second.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.351
What?

36:00.375 --> 36:03.137
That is so weird and shitty!
Why are you even with her?

36:03.161 --> 36:04.877
Because you're with that douche.

36:04.901 --> 36:07.663
I'd never do that!
I knew it! You're such a liar.

36:07.687 --> 36:09.882
What?
I can't believe I was gonna

36:09.906 --> 36:11.841
give you another chance. And
you! All that crap about how you

36:11.865 --> 36:14.322
wanted me back and how sorry
you were? What was that about?

36:14.346 --> 36:16.933
You should be mad at him!
It takes two, Brooke!

36:16.957 --> 36:18.804
Can you not do this? Remember
what happened last time?

36:18.828 --> 36:21.198
You know what? If you
want him, you can have him.

36:21.222 --> 36:23.983
He's a loser anyways!
Stop accusing me of shit!

36:24.007 --> 36:27.596
You've always wanted to sleep with him!
Fine! You two deserve each other!

36:27.620 --> 36:30.816
You know what? Screw you! No!
I hate her! I hate this bitch!

36:30.840 --> 36:33.341
I need another drink.

36:33.365 --> 36:35.952
Ugh!

36:35.976 --> 36:38.021
Brooke!

36:40.023 --> 36:42.001
Brooke. Brooke, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

36:42.025 --> 36:43.960
Come here. Look.

36:43.984 --> 36:46.005
Let's ditch all of these losers
and let's get out of here.

36:46.029 --> 36:48.225
They're not losers.
They're my friends.

36:48.249 --> 36:50.793
Yeah, great friends.
All she's done is fight

36:50.817 --> 36:52.838
with you, and everyone is just
crowding around her like she's

36:52.862 --> 36:56.102
some little damsel in distress.
Let's just go back to my place.

36:56.126 --> 36:58.279
No. You go. I'm staying.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.063
Brooke. Listen to me.
You are wasted right now.

37:00.087 --> 37:02.152
You have no clue
what you're saying.

37:02.176 --> 37:04.328
I know how to take care
of my drunk girlfriend.

37:04.352 --> 37:07.113
Jake, I am not your girlfriend.

37:07.137 --> 37:09.812
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not! Stop trying to run my life!

37:09.836 --> 37:12.336
Brooke, I am trying to do
what's best for you right now.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.382
Oh! You, my mom, everyone
knows what's best for me.

37:14.406 --> 37:17.515
Well, you know what? I know
what's best for me! I know!

37:17.539 --> 37:19.865
And I don't need you.
Okay? I'm done!

37:19.889 --> 37:21.867
Brooke, please just stop being
an idiot for two seconds.

37:21.891 --> 37:24.957
Just listen to me!
Now you're calling me names? No!

37:24.981 --> 37:27.046
Seriously Jake, get the hell out
of here! Okay? I don't need you!

37:27.070 --> 37:29.682
Just leave me alone!

37:31.423 --> 37:33.923
Everything okay?

37:33.947 --> 37:36.795
Yeah. I think she just
needs to sleep it off.

37:36.819 --> 37:39.102
That's fine.
She can stay here.

37:39.126 --> 37:41.476
Okay. Cool.

38:02.584 --> 38:04.717
DAMN IT!

38:09.330 --> 38:11.308
Okay. I've gotta keep her.

38:11.332 --> 38:13.508
I've gotta keep her.

38:21.081 --> 38:23.320
<i>♪ Who's it gonna be, love? ♪</i>

38:23.344 --> 38:26.584
<i>♪ Who's it gonna be, love?
Who's gonna be ♪</i>

38:26.608 --> 38:29.239
<i>♪ The last one standing?
Who's it gonna be, love? ♪</i>

38:29.263 --> 38:31.633
<i>♪ Who's it gonna be, love? ♪</i>

38:31.657 --> 38:34.462
<i>♪ Who's gonna be the
last one standing? ♪</i>

38:34.486 --> 38:36.705
Some best friend you are.

38:38.751 --> 38:41.207
He was my boyfriend.

38:41.231 --> 38:43.321
Not yours.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.412
Why can't he
just like me better?

38:52.939 --> 38:55.245
I just love him so much.

39:18.138 --> 39:20.159
See?
No, I'm not!

39:50.170 --> 39:53.173
We were perfect for each other.

39:57.525 --> 39:59.658
Why can't you see that?

41:03.678 --> 41:05.874
Brooke?

41:05.898 --> 41:07.987
Brooke!

41:24.394 --> 41:26.440
I'm sorry, Brooke.

42:23.410 --> 42:25.301
Oh, my God! Maddie!

42:28.241 --> 42:30.436
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

42:38.643 --> 42:41.491
I've gotta call 911!

42:44.605 --> 42:47.105
Maddie?

42:47.129 --> 42:50.568
No! I couldn't have done this!

45:30.205 --> 45:32.270
Mom... What are you doing up?

45:32.294 --> 45:35.384
I thought I heard something.
What are you doing home already?

45:37.430 --> 45:39.451
I think I'm getting sick.
I think I have the flu

45:39.475 --> 45:41.410
or something.
Oh.

45:41.434 --> 45:43.412
Well, you don't have a fever.

45:43.436 --> 45:46.067
Whose hoodie is that?

45:46.091 --> 45:48.983
It's... it's Riley's.

45:49.007 --> 45:51.202
I was cold,

45:51.226 --> 45:52.900
so I... I put it on.

45:52.924 --> 45:54.815
I'm just gonna go

45:54.839 --> 45:57.121
take a shower and get some rest.

45:57.145 --> 45:59.080
Sweetheart, are you okay?

45:59.104 --> 46:01.125
I'm fine! I have cheer camp
in the morning,

46:01.149 --> 46:03.171
and I'm exhausted, and I wish
you wouldn't interrogate me

46:03.195 --> 46:05.347
when I walk through the door!
Brooke...

46:05.371 --> 46:07.503
Mom! Just leave me alone!

46:43.191 --> 46:46.020
Damn it.

46:49.981 --> 46:52.133
Keisha?

46:52.157 --> 46:54.309
Yeah. No, I'm coming.

46:54.333 --> 46:56.833
I'm on my way.

47:21.142 --> 47:23.101
Hello?

47:26.844 --> 47:29.716
Riley?

48:14.804 --> 48:16.782
Mr. Pratt?

48:16.806 --> 48:19.481
Who are you?

48:19.505 --> 48:21.613
Oh, shoot.

48:21.637 --> 48:24.660
Sorry. I must've passed out
here last night.

48:24.684 --> 48:26.575
I had way too much to drink.

48:48.012 --> 48:50.904
Call the police.

48:50.928 --> 48:53.732
CALL THE POLICE!

49:07.509 --> 49:09.270
Brooke?

49:09.294 --> 49:11.383
What's going on in here?
Are you okay?

49:13.689 --> 49:16.083
Yeah, I'm all right.
I just need a minute.

49:18.477 --> 49:20.672
Where's Maddie today?

49:20.696 --> 49:23.134
I don't know.

49:25.223 --> 49:27.244
See you out there.

49:34.232 --> 49:36.732
I'm telling you
I didn't kill her!

49:36.756 --> 49:38.821
Look, after the big fight
with Brooke, I did a few shots.

49:38.845 --> 49:41.606
I went looking for Maddie
and I found her in a bathroom.

49:41.630 --> 49:43.869
What was the fight
with Brooke about?

49:43.893 --> 49:46.176
Maddie thought

49:46.200 --> 49:48.091
I was trying to get with Brooke
behind Maddie's back.

49:48.115 --> 49:50.137
Were you?
No! Look, of...

49:50.161 --> 49:52.617
of course not!
I... I loved Maddie.

49:52.641 --> 49:54.924
All right? She and Brooke
just had this weird

49:54.948 --> 49:58.014
jealousy thing between them.
Have they fought before?

49:58.038 --> 49:59.711
A lot. Brooke told me
they got into a fight recently

49:59.735 --> 50:02.105
at a karaoke bar. I wasn't
there, but I heard it got bad.

50:02.129 --> 50:05.021
What happened after Maddie
told you to leave her alone?

50:05.045 --> 50:07.676
I went outside.

50:07.700 --> 50:09.678
I had a beer with Riley.
I don't know where Maddie went.

50:09.702 --> 50:13.160
I was too drunk to drive home,
so I went upstairs.

50:13.184 --> 50:15.553
I found an empty bed,
and I went to sleep.

50:15.577 --> 50:19.383
You never saw her
at all after that?

50:19.407 --> 50:21.907
No.

50:21.931 --> 50:24.998
You know this doesn't
look good for you, right?

50:25.022 --> 50:27.870
Your ex-girlfriend gets murdered

50:27.894 --> 50:29.939
after you and she have
a big public fight.

50:32.290 --> 50:34.790
Unless there's someone else
we need to look at,

50:34.814 --> 50:37.532
I'm looking directly at you.

50:37.556 --> 50:40.274
Who do you think
murdered Maddie?

50:40.298 --> 50:42.754
I don't know.

50:42.778 --> 50:45.583
The only person
I can think of...

50:45.607 --> 50:48.499
but they were best friends.

50:48.523 --> 50:50.371
Who?

50:50.395 --> 50:52.503
Brooke Emerson.

51:16.116 --> 51:18.901
You're mine forever, Brooke.

51:22.731 --> 51:26.189
Wow. You look like death.

51:26.213 --> 51:28.800
What does that mean?
Brooke, you were

51:28.824 --> 51:30.976
so wasted last night, you could
barely walk by yourself.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.891
What time did you leave?

51:32.915 --> 51:36.199
I don't know.
After 2. I don't remember.

51:36.223 --> 51:38.071
Do you remember
fighting with Maddie?

51:38.095 --> 51:41.248
A little. Why?
What did we fight about?

51:41.272 --> 51:42.336
Tryg.

51:42.360 --> 51:44.816
And then you
passed out upstairs.

51:44.840 --> 51:47.602
All right, guys. Let's show 'em
in the high V again, huh?

51:47.626 --> 51:49.604
Great.

51:49.628 --> 51:51.543
Nice and high. Awesome.

51:58.898 --> 52:00.832
Detective Myers.

52:00.856 --> 52:03.183
We found one of your
students dead this morning:

52:03.207 --> 52:05.252
Maddie Finley.

52:13.521 --> 52:15.717
I have a few questions
to ask you.

52:15.741 --> 52:19.155
We're investigating

52:19.179 --> 52:21.679
a situation that happened
earlier this morning.

52:21.703 --> 52:24.726
What kind of situation?

52:24.750 --> 52:27.859
How do you know Maddie Finley?

52:27.883 --> 52:30.035
Um...

52:30.059 --> 52:32.081
We're friends.

52:32.105 --> 52:34.823
I understand you were at a
party where she was last night,

52:34.847 --> 52:37.042
at the home of...

52:37.066 --> 52:39.262
Riley Pratt.

52:39.286 --> 52:42.396
Did you get into a fight
with Maddie there?

52:42.420 --> 52:45.703
Um...

52:45.727 --> 52:47.705
I don't remember.

52:47.729 --> 52:51.187
You don't? Why not?

52:51.211 --> 52:53.102
I take this medication and...

52:53.126 --> 52:55.084
sometimes I don't
remember things.

53:01.439 --> 53:03.721
Does that happen to you a lot?

53:03.745 --> 53:07.290
No, not really.

53:07.314 --> 53:09.597
Did Maddie ever talk to you

53:09.621 --> 53:12.667
about Tryg Bailey, her ex?

53:16.280 --> 53:18.214
Yeah, of course.

53:18.238 --> 53:20.260
Were they on good terms?

53:20.284 --> 53:23.698
Yeah, for the most part,

53:23.722 --> 53:26.222
but...

53:26.246 --> 53:29.704
Maddie always thought that I was
going after Tryg or something,

53:29.728 --> 53:31.967
but I would never
do that to her.

53:31.991 --> 53:34.167
What time did you
leave the party to go home?

53:36.996 --> 53:38.887
2?

53:38.911 --> 53:40.758
I woke up

53:40.782 --> 53:43.500
in a guest bedroom and um...

53:43.524 --> 53:45.918
I left right after that.

53:49.008 --> 53:50.812
Did you see Maddie
as you were leaving?

53:50.836 --> 53:54.729
Yeah. I saw her
in the kitchen.

53:54.753 --> 53:57.166
I didn't talk to her, though.

53:57.190 --> 54:00.324
So you remember
that part of the evening?

54:02.369 --> 54:05.261
Well, yeah.
It was before that.

54:05.285 --> 54:08.046
That's when it gets a bit fuzzy.

54:08.070 --> 54:10.527
Brooke...

54:10.551 --> 54:13.424
Maddie was found dead this
morning at the Pratt residence.

54:22.389 --> 54:24.367
How?

54:24.391 --> 54:27.264
I can't give details
at the moment...

54:29.701 --> 54:31.722
...but it appears
to have been a homicide.

54:45.064 --> 54:47.066
This is crazy...

54:52.854 --> 54:54.856
She was fine...

54:56.815 --> 54:59.383
Oh, my God!

55:23.581 --> 55:26.279
Hey. How was cheer camp?

55:30.892 --> 55:33.784
What's wrong?

55:33.808 --> 55:35.810
Did something happen?

55:39.553 --> 55:42.663
Maddie was...
murdered last night.

55:42.687 --> 55:45.274
What?!
The police, they ca...

55:45.298 --> 55:49.234
they came to my camp, and they
were asking all these...

55:49.258 --> 55:51.846
questions, and...
it happened at this party

55:51.870 --> 55:53.804
we were all at yesterday,
and I was there,

55:53.828 --> 55:56.329
and we were all there.
Oh, my God.

55:56.353 --> 55:58.418
I guess their housekeeper

55:58.442 --> 56:00.420
found her this morning.
And all this

56:00.444 --> 56:03.118
happened at a...
at a party last night?

56:03.142 --> 56:06.904
I'm sorry I lied to you.
What went on there?

56:06.928 --> 56:10.299
I don't remember.

56:10.323 --> 56:13.650
I got so drunk,
and we got into this huge fight.

56:13.674 --> 56:16.174
About what?

56:16.198 --> 56:18.742
Tryg, I guess.

56:18.766 --> 56:21.049
I went upstairs,
and I passed out.

56:21.073 --> 56:23.791
Brooke...

56:23.815 --> 56:26.750
Mom... I think the police
might suspect me

56:26.774 --> 56:29.144
because me and Maddie got into
that fight. They were asking me

56:29.168 --> 56:31.364
all these questions.

56:31.388 --> 56:33.714
Did you tell them the truth?

56:33.738 --> 56:36.238
Yeah.

56:36.262 --> 56:38.283
Well then, there's...

56:38.307 --> 56:40.242
there's nothing to worry about.

56:40.266 --> 56:43.419
I... I bet the police

56:43.443 --> 56:45.856
were asking everybody
at the party a lot of questions.

56:45.880 --> 56:47.815
This is so horrible!

56:47.839 --> 56:50.034
I...

56:50.058 --> 56:52.210
Who are you calling?

56:52.234 --> 56:54.561
I'm calling Maddie's mom!

56:54.585 --> 56:57.302
We need to give her
our condolences.

56:57.326 --> 56:59.870
I... No. You know what?

56:59.894 --> 57:01.785
We just, um...

57:01.809 --> 57:03.811
We need to go
over there in person.

57:08.120 --> 57:10.272
What do you
think of the girl, Brooke?

57:10.296 --> 57:12.709
They had a fight. It doesn't
mean she killed her.

57:12.733 --> 57:14.711
True, but...
when I interviewed her,

57:14.735 --> 57:16.713
it seemed like
she was holding back.

57:16.737 --> 57:19.890
You got that same feeling
about Tryg.

57:19.914 --> 57:22.197
Riley...

57:22.221 --> 57:23.938
the kid who lives in the house?

57:23.962 --> 57:25.940
He said that Tryg
had just got back together

57:25.964 --> 57:28.595
with the dead girl, but was
carrying a torch for Brooke.

57:28.619 --> 57:32.468
According to Tryg, he was
head-over-heels for Maddie.

57:32.492 --> 57:34.601
Interesting little
love triangle.

57:34.625 --> 57:37.038
With all that going on,
it's kind of hard to believe

57:37.062 --> 57:39.083
it was someone
completely unrelated.

57:39.107 --> 57:41.477
Yeah, look. I hear you,
but there were 50 people

57:41.501 --> 57:43.827
there last night, going in
and out of that house.

57:43.851 --> 57:45.655
The doors were unlocked.

57:45.679 --> 57:48.528
I mean, people who didn't even
attend knew about the party.

57:48.552 --> 57:50.747
Look, let's just
keep an open mind.

57:50.771 --> 57:53.533
Okay? And who else was there
that we need to talk to?

57:53.557 --> 57:57.517
We haven't reached out to any
of the neighbours. Let's do it.

58:28.592 --> 58:30.681
I couldn't have done this.

58:51.049 --> 58:53.312
Jake?

58:56.402 --> 58:58.598
Hey.

58:58.622 --> 59:00.600
What are you doing here?

59:00.624 --> 59:02.950
I just wanted to talk to you.
I'm really sorry

59:02.974 --> 59:04.778
about your friend.
How do you even know?!

59:04.802 --> 59:07.737
It's on the news.
They gave out her address?

59:07.761 --> 59:09.565
No, I just...
I followed you and your mom

59:09.589 --> 59:12.829
from your house.
What?! I have to go.

59:12.853 --> 59:16.354
Jake, I appreciate your
concern...

59:16.378 --> 59:19.488
but I just really need
to be left alone right now.

59:19.512 --> 59:21.185
This is a really hard time
for me and my mom

59:21.209 --> 59:24.493
and... I can't deal with this!
What do you mean,

59:24.517 --> 59:26.582
"you can't deal with this"?
I just wanted to support you.

59:26.606 --> 59:29.324
I get it, but your presence
makes things complicated.

59:29.348 --> 59:31.152
I don't want to be
in a relationship with you.

59:31.176 --> 59:33.415
Don't go, Brooke. I love you!
But you don't even know me!

59:33.439 --> 59:35.243
Yes, I do! We get each other
on a whole other level!

59:35.267 --> 59:38.768
Jake, leave me alone.
I don't like you that way.

59:38.792 --> 59:41.466
Hello, Jake.
Hey.

59:41.490 --> 59:43.971
Brooke, honey, why did you
leave like that?

59:46.147 --> 59:48.169
I needed to talk to him.

59:48.193 --> 59:50.388
He heard what happened
on the news.

59:50.412 --> 59:53.914
Yeah, I think that we're
all... still in shock.

59:53.938 --> 59:55.611
I am. It's...

59:55.635 --> 59:57.570
It's unbelievable.

59:57.594 --> 59:59.789
Yeah. I really hope
that they catch that monster

59:59.813 --> 01:00:01.878
and put him behind bars
for a very,

01:00:01.902 --> 01:00:04.751
very long time.

01:00:04.775 --> 01:00:07.231
Yeah, so do I.

01:00:07.255 --> 01:00:09.973
Mom? Are you ready to go?

01:00:09.997 --> 01:00:11.932
Sure, but don't you wanna

01:00:11.956 --> 01:00:13.934
go inside and say goodbye
to Maddie's mom?

01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:16.221
Okay.

01:00:29.887 --> 01:00:31.802
No! I hate her!
I hate this bitch!

01:00:50.124 --> 01:00:53.321
You've reached the office

01:00:53.345 --> 01:00:55.584
of Dr. Fenson.
Please leave a message,

01:00:55.608 --> 01:00:58.065
and someone will return
your call during office hours.

01:00:58.089 --> 01:01:00.458
Hi, Dr. Fenson.

01:01:00.482 --> 01:01:02.504
It's Brooke Emerson calling.

01:01:02.528 --> 01:01:05.159
I really need to speak to you.

01:01:05.183 --> 01:01:08.379
I was hoping if you could
find time tomorrow for me,

01:01:08.403 --> 01:01:10.730
that'd be great.

01:01:10.754 --> 01:01:12.601
Let me know.

01:01:12.625 --> 01:01:14.671
Thanks. Bye.

01:01:23.767 --> 01:01:25.856
Just answer me, Brooke.

01:01:28.423 --> 01:01:30.619
Just answer me, Brooke!

01:01:30.643 --> 01:01:32.819
It's a simple question!
JUST ANSWER ME!

01:01:34.952 --> 01:01:36.712
GOD!

01:01:36.736 --> 01:01:38.496
Why are you doing this to me?

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.978
Just stop ignoring me!

01:01:42.002 --> 01:01:43.763
Tell me what's
going on with you.

01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:46.156
Did you hear about
that Maddie Finley girl...

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.768
in the news? The one that got
murdered at that party?

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.552
Yes.

01:01:50.576 --> 01:01:52.380
Well, that was
my friend, Maddie,

01:01:52.404 --> 01:01:54.730
and I was there
when it happened.

01:01:54.754 --> 01:01:57.646
Oh, Brooke. That's terrible.
We got

01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:59.517
into this... huge fight,

01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:02.042
and I can't remember
anything that I said.

01:02:02.066 --> 01:02:04.261
Were you drinking?
Yeah.

01:02:04.285 --> 01:02:07.221
But I didn't take a pill
that day intentionally,

01:02:07.245 --> 01:02:08.875
and I don't know why I can't
remember anything!

01:02:08.899 --> 01:02:11.704
Well, skipping one pill isn't
gonna make a difference.

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.662
It can take up to a week

01:02:13.686 --> 01:02:17.168
for medication
to leave your body.

01:02:19.953 --> 01:02:22.042
What do you really
wanna tell me, Brooke?

01:02:24.523 --> 01:02:26.457
I wanna help the police.

01:02:26.481 --> 01:02:29.112
I do, but I can't
remember anything.

01:02:29.136 --> 01:02:31.530
And I'm trying
so hard, but I can't.

01:02:33.924 --> 01:02:36.554
I need to know what happened.
I need to know who did this!

01:02:36.578 --> 01:02:39.209
Let's, uh...

01:02:39.233 --> 01:02:41.714
talk about what you
remember when you woke up.

01:02:45.936 --> 01:02:47.827
I can't.

01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:50.984
I can't. I have to go. I can't.

01:03:01.299 --> 01:03:03.668
Hey.

01:03:03.692 --> 01:03:06.565
Are you okay?

01:03:08.567 --> 01:03:11.328
How did you get in here?

01:03:14.573 --> 01:03:17.358
I'm everywhere.

01:03:27.064 --> 01:03:29.849
Why are you making this so hard?

01:03:31.677 --> 01:03:35.178
What do you want from me?
I just wanna see you.

01:03:35.202 --> 01:03:37.398
I wanna spend time with you.
I wanna love you,

01:03:37.422 --> 01:03:39.443
just like we were before.

01:03:39.467 --> 01:03:41.271
Are you not listening to me?!

01:03:41.295 --> 01:03:43.056
You're acting completely crazy!

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.841
I am not crazy.

01:03:45.865 --> 01:03:47.843
Don't you ever
say that to me again.

01:03:47.867 --> 01:03:50.237
Breaking into someone's house
is not normal.

01:03:50.261 --> 01:03:53.414
All I want is to have
somebody that I connect with.

01:03:53.438 --> 01:03:56.025
Someone that I can do anything
for and that will do anything

01:03:56.049 --> 01:03:58.071
for me, and that person
is you, Brooke!

01:03:58.095 --> 01:04:00.682
You don't know
what true love is,

01:04:00.706 --> 01:04:03.206
and that's why you don't
understand any of this.

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:06.407
I don't love you, Jake.

01:04:11.282 --> 01:04:13.284
Brooke...

01:04:15.547 --> 01:04:19.832
I can make things
very complicated for you...

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.988
or I can make them easy.

01:04:23.816 --> 01:04:25.576
What does that mean?

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.709
We both know that you
killed Maddie, don't we?

01:04:27.733 --> 01:04:31.017
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:33.715
Yes, you do.
That's why you hid the knife

01:04:33.739 --> 01:04:36.631
and your shirt in the pillowcase
and put it in the dumpster.

01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:40.156
Guess what?

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.028
They're not
in the dumpster anymore!

01:04:42.052 --> 01:04:45.205
Where are they?

01:04:45.229 --> 01:04:47.076
They're safe.

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:50.732
And as long as you're with me,
they'll stay safe.

01:04:50.756 --> 01:04:52.603
So you're blackmailing me
to be with you?

01:04:52.627 --> 01:04:54.562
No! No, I just want you

01:04:54.586 --> 01:04:56.520
to realize that I'm
important in your life.

01:04:56.544 --> 01:05:00.742
You and I are connected
for the rest of our lives.

01:05:00.766 --> 01:05:03.638
And I will keep
your secret forever.

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:08.663
I did not kill her.

01:05:08.687 --> 01:05:12.232
Brooke. Come on.

01:05:12.256 --> 01:05:14.451
You wouldn't have
ditched the murder weapon

01:05:14.475 --> 01:05:17.411
if you were innocent. You even
sent me pictures of her body.

01:05:17.435 --> 01:05:19.804
No, I didn't!
I would never do that!

01:05:19.828 --> 01:05:22.242
It's okay. I have
an app that encrypts

01:05:22.266 --> 01:05:24.679
all the texts that are
sent and received, so...

01:05:24.703 --> 01:05:26.835
you're fine.

01:05:33.016 --> 01:05:35.192
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:43.200
Hey.

01:05:46.203 --> 01:05:48.485
That was the homeowner

01:05:48.509 --> 01:05:50.487
that lives down the street
from the Pratt house.

01:05:50.511 --> 01:05:53.142
He said when he pulled
into his driveway at 3 AM,

01:05:53.166 --> 01:05:54.927
there was a high-end sports car

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:57.930
parked across from his house. He
said he'd never seen it before.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.193
Make? Model? Colour?
He's not sure

01:06:00.217 --> 01:06:03.022
about the colour. It was dark,
but he thinks it might have been

01:06:03.046 --> 01:06:05.459
a Mercedes or a BMW. Expensive.

01:06:05.483 --> 01:06:07.809
Uh-huh.

01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:10.053
This is insane.

01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:14.163
I wish I could just wake up and
have this all be a nightmare.

01:06:14.187 --> 01:06:16.644
Brooke... this is real.

01:06:16.668 --> 01:06:19.473
I'm the only one
that knows what you did,

01:06:19.497 --> 01:06:22.369
and as long as we're together,
no one's ever gonna know.

01:06:24.415 --> 01:06:26.959
I got you something.

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:29.309
You don't have
to say yes right now,

01:06:29.333 --> 01:06:31.093
but...

01:06:31.117 --> 01:06:33.052
I couldn't help it
when I saw it.

01:06:33.076 --> 01:06:35.576
I had to get it. And I didn't
have the ring sizes either,

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:38.883
so I just had to guess, but we
can... we can get it resized.

01:06:38.907 --> 01:06:41.538
No, Jake! Please, stop!
STOP PLAYING GAMES

01:06:41.562 --> 01:06:43.671
WITH ME, BROOKE! JUST BE HAPPY!
Do you not see

01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:45.803
that I will do anything
to make you happy?

01:06:45.827 --> 01:06:48.850
DO YOU NOT GET THAT?!

01:07:13.899 --> 01:07:15.877
Mom...

01:07:15.901 --> 01:07:18.445
Brooke. What are you
doing here?

01:07:18.469 --> 01:07:21.448
Instead of going to school,

01:07:21.472 --> 01:07:23.189
I went to go see Dr. Fenson.

01:07:23.213 --> 01:07:25.539
Oh, honey.

01:07:25.563 --> 01:07:27.323
I know this is a difficult time

01:07:27.347 --> 01:07:29.325
for you.

01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:31.221
What'd she say?

01:07:39.272 --> 01:07:41.903
I wanted to tell her, I just...

01:07:41.927 --> 01:07:44.384
couldn't bring myself to do it.

01:07:44.408 --> 01:07:46.429
Tell her what?

01:07:46.453 --> 01:07:48.605
Oh, God.
Where do I even start?

01:07:48.629 --> 01:07:52.696
Hey, Brooke.
Am I interrupting?

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.525
Could you just give us
a couple minutes?

01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:57.223
No, it's okay.

01:07:57.247 --> 01:07:59.510
Alex can stay.

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.498
I don't even know
how to say this.

01:08:11.522 --> 01:08:13.543
Oh, honey, just...
just tell us.

01:08:13.567 --> 01:08:17.069
Whatever it is,
we're here for you.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:20.246
I think I killed Maddie.

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.203
Wha...
What?!

01:08:22.228 --> 01:08:24.118
Why would you
think such a thing?

01:08:24.143 --> 01:08:26.861
I drank a lot that night.

01:08:26.885 --> 01:08:29.951
I got so drunk.
Maddie and I got

01:08:29.975 --> 01:08:32.432
into this fight and...
according to Riley,

01:08:32.456 --> 01:08:34.608
I... I passed out
in the guest room, and...

01:08:34.631 --> 01:08:37.089
then the next thing

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:39.787
I remember was waking up...

01:08:39.810 --> 01:08:42.029
What?

01:08:45.991 --> 01:08:48.578
I...

01:08:48.602 --> 01:08:51.755
I woke up to her dead body
laying there beside me.

01:08:51.779 --> 01:08:54.062
There was all this blood, and...

01:08:54.086 --> 01:08:56.978
there was the knife, and...

01:08:57.002 --> 01:08:59.720
there's even pictures
of her body on my phone.

01:08:59.743 --> 01:09:02.505
Oh, my God.
I freaked out.

01:09:02.529 --> 01:09:05.465
I took all the evidence,
and I put in a trash bag,

01:09:05.488 --> 01:09:07.380
and then I went to the dumpster,
and I dumped it out.

01:09:07.404 --> 01:09:09.207
Where?

01:09:09.232 --> 01:09:11.210
It's not there anymore.

01:09:11.234 --> 01:09:13.192
You looked?
No.

01:09:14.975 --> 01:09:18.216
Jake followed me
there after, and...

01:09:18.241 --> 01:09:20.131
he took it. He said...

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:22.090
if I don't stay with him,
he's gonna

01:09:22.113 --> 01:09:24.179
bring it to the police.
Okay.

01:09:24.203 --> 01:09:25.920
Hold on.

01:09:25.944 --> 01:09:27.835
What does Jake have
to do with any of this?

01:09:27.859 --> 01:09:29.837
He came to the party with me,

01:09:29.861 --> 01:09:33.100
but Riley said he saw him
leave after I passed out.

01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:35.103
He's been stalking me ever since

01:09:35.127 --> 01:09:37.236
our first date.

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:39.151
What... what do you mean?

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:41.153
He shows up at school
randomly, and he came

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.962
to Maddie's house
that one time we were there.

01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:50.423
He gave me this,

01:09:50.447 --> 01:09:53.033
and... and said I had

01:09:53.058 --> 01:09:55.123
to stay with him,
so that he would...

01:09:55.147 --> 01:09:57.081
he would keep the secret
about what I did.

01:09:57.105 --> 01:09:59.736
You've got to be kidding me!

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.000
I don't know
what to do, but I can't

01:10:03.024 --> 01:10:05.220
live like this! I...
I can't sleep. All I keep

01:10:05.244 --> 01:10:07.266
thinking about is
what I did to Maddie.

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:10.443
Brooke. You didn't do
anything to Maddie.

01:10:10.467 --> 01:10:13.272
You are not a killer.
How do you know that?

01:10:13.296 --> 01:10:16.275
How do you know? I could've
gotten so mad that I could've

01:10:16.299 --> 01:10:19.191
done it! I just wish I could
remember what happened.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.802
It sounds to me
like maybe Jake is involved.

01:10:21.826 --> 01:10:25.284
He was in the house.
No. Riley saw him leave.

01:10:25.308 --> 01:10:27.286
He could've come back.

01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:29.418
But... if...

01:10:29.442 --> 01:10:31.377
he's so in love with me,
then why would he do that?

01:10:31.401 --> 01:10:33.422
To have something
to lord over you.

01:10:33.446 --> 01:10:36.860
Mom, I don't know what to do.

01:10:36.884 --> 01:10:38.819
Okay.

01:10:38.843 --> 01:10:40.908
We need to go to the police,

01:10:40.932 --> 01:10:43.867
and we're going
to tell them all of this.

01:10:43.891 --> 01:10:46.043
No. I can't. They're gonna
think I did it.

01:10:46.067 --> 01:10:48.002
I... I lied to them about
where I was. I lied to them

01:10:48.026 --> 01:10:50.613
about what time I left. I lied
to them about seeing Maddie.

01:10:50.637 --> 01:10:52.920
It doesn't matter. Okay?
We have to get a lawyer.

01:10:52.944 --> 01:10:56.924
They want to solve this case,
and if somehow he is the killer,

01:10:56.948 --> 01:10:59.472
they'll wanna know this.

01:11:01.561 --> 01:11:03.650
He's right.

01:11:05.957 --> 01:11:08.588
So he has evidence,

01:11:08.612 --> 01:11:12.418
including the murder weapon,
in his possession right now?

01:11:12.442 --> 01:11:15.943
I guess he still has it, or...

01:11:15.967 --> 01:11:18.467
he got rid of it somehow.
I don't know.

01:11:18.491 --> 01:11:20.513
Why did you lie to us when we
questioned you the first time?

01:11:20.537 --> 01:11:24.125
She's 17, Detective,
and very traumatized.

01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:26.649
Now, what's important
is that she's coming

01:11:26.673 --> 01:11:30.610
to you now with the truth.
And we do appreciate that.

01:11:30.634 --> 01:11:34.725
That doesn't mean
we've cleared her as a suspect.

01:11:36.727 --> 01:11:39.140
Are you going to question Jake?

01:11:39.164 --> 01:11:41.514
Tell us everything
you know about him.

01:11:48.695 --> 01:11:51.718
How'd it go?
Uh...

01:11:51.742 --> 01:11:55.243
Good. They seemed
open to the possibility

01:11:55.267 --> 01:11:57.289
that Jake was involved.

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:59.421
I saw the new alarm system.

01:11:59.445 --> 01:12:02.206
Yeah. Your new key is on the
kitchen counter. Code is set.

01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:04.905
He's driven by twice.

01:12:04.929 --> 01:12:07.037
Jake?
Yeah.

01:12:07.061 --> 01:12:10.456
Unreal.

01:13:31.755 --> 01:13:34.516
Brooke?

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:37.021
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

01:13:39.676 --> 01:13:41.417
I thought I heard something.

01:13:43.593 --> 01:13:45.527
Well, the alarm system's on.
Everything is secure.

01:13:45.551 --> 01:13:49.313
Don't worry.
He's not gonna get in.

01:13:49.337 --> 01:13:51.533
Are you sure?

01:13:51.557 --> 01:13:53.753
Positive.

01:13:53.777 --> 01:13:56.170
Come on.
Try and get some sleep.

01:14:11.403 --> 01:14:13.710
Why can't you love me?

01:14:23.502 --> 01:14:25.678
Hey.
Hey, girl.

01:14:32.032 --> 01:14:34.034
Come in.

01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:41.061
It's like Fort Knox here now.

01:14:41.085 --> 01:14:43.696
Yeah, we just got
that installed yesterday.

01:14:45.698 --> 01:14:47.937
Are you worried
that whoever killed Maddie's

01:14:47.961 --> 01:14:49.765
gonna come after you?

01:14:49.789 --> 01:14:51.680
You can never
be too careful, right?

01:14:51.704 --> 01:14:53.900
Shouldn't you be in chem?

01:14:53.924 --> 01:14:56.076
I was worried when I didn't
see you at school today.

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.165
Yeah. I'm fine. I just,

01:14:58.189 --> 01:15:00.384
I'm not ready to go back yet.
Maybe next week.

01:15:00.408 --> 01:15:02.561
Brooke...

01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:04.693
I think you should come back
sooner than later.

01:15:04.717 --> 01:15:06.565
Why?

01:15:06.589 --> 01:15:08.392
People are talking.

01:15:08.416 --> 01:15:10.917
Tryg said that he saw you at the
police station with your lawyer,

01:15:10.941 --> 01:15:13.310
and that you're about to get
arrested for Maddie's murder.

01:15:13.334 --> 01:15:16.488
Is that true?
No.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:18.968
I mean...

01:15:18.992 --> 01:15:20.840
Yeah, I was at
the police station, but I was

01:15:20.864 --> 01:15:22.885
just giving information.
About what?

01:15:22.909 --> 01:15:24.887
I can't say...

01:15:24.911 --> 01:15:27.890
but I can tell you that they're
looking at new suspects.

01:15:27.914 --> 01:15:31.372
Well, you need
to defend yourself.

01:15:31.396 --> 01:15:33.592
People are doing crazy stuff.

01:15:33.616 --> 01:15:35.724
Like what?

01:15:35.748 --> 01:15:37.596
Someone wrote

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:39.491
"murderer" on your locker.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.086
Yeah?
Mr. Campali?

01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:53.070
There's a Detective Lynn Grinly
here to see you.

01:15:54.985 --> 01:15:56.769
Sure. Send her up.

01:16:00.207 --> 01:16:03.535
And when you left the party,
was Brooke still there?

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.449
That's right.

01:16:05.473 --> 01:16:07.451
Where did you go after you left?

01:16:07.475 --> 01:16:09.758
Home.

01:16:09.782 --> 01:16:12.611
And when was the next time
you spoke to Brooke?

01:16:14.439 --> 01:16:16.243
Uh... The next day.

01:16:16.267 --> 01:16:18.462
I just texted her
to make sure she was all right.

01:16:18.486 --> 01:16:21.335
Did Brooke say anything to you

01:16:21.359 --> 01:16:23.903
about what happened after she
woke up the next morning?

01:16:23.927 --> 01:16:26.538
No.

01:16:28.888 --> 01:16:31.432
Did she ever talk to you
about bloody clothing

01:16:31.456 --> 01:16:33.303
or... give you a trash bag

01:16:33.327 --> 01:16:35.610
and ask you to hide it for her?

01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:37.612
Uh...

01:16:37.636 --> 01:16:39.658
No. Never.

01:16:39.682 --> 01:16:41.747
So you know nothing about
what happened to the clothes

01:16:41.771 --> 01:16:43.923
she was wearing at the party?

01:16:43.947 --> 01:16:46.969
No. I don't.

01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:19.105
Brooke. Hey.

01:18:19.129 --> 01:18:21.629
I can't do this anymore.
Do what?

01:18:21.653 --> 01:18:25.111
Calm down. Talk to me.
What I did to Maddie.

01:18:25.135 --> 01:18:27.964
It's all I think about.

01:18:29.922 --> 01:18:32.292
I can't sleep,
and when I do sleep,

01:18:32.316 --> 01:18:34.729
it's all I dream about.
Don't do that to yourself.

01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:37.166
It was your IED
that caused it. Not you.

01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:40.692
No! I'm responsible for her death.
I'm the reason she's gone.

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:43.738
Even people at school
think I did it too.

01:18:43.762 --> 01:18:45.740
Who cares what those idiots
think? Look, I know that you're

01:18:45.764 --> 01:18:48.134
a good person, Brooke,
and that's what matters.

01:18:48.158 --> 01:18:50.179
No, I'm not.

01:18:50.203 --> 01:18:52.399
I'm horrible.

01:18:52.423 --> 01:18:55.837
And the police think
I did it too.

01:18:55.861 --> 01:18:58.231
Well, the police don't have
any evidence to convict you,

01:18:58.255 --> 01:19:00.102
so don't let them
put the pressure on you.

01:19:00.126 --> 01:19:02.148
Jake...

01:19:02.172 --> 01:19:05.064
I'm done.

01:19:05.088 --> 01:19:07.046
What does that mean?

01:19:09.092 --> 01:19:11.050
I just wanted to say goodbye.

01:19:13.183 --> 01:19:15.335
There's a note in my room
explaining everything.

01:19:15.359 --> 01:19:17.424
No! No! No, no, no, no!
Brooke, listen to me.

01:19:17.448 --> 01:19:19.992
Where are you? There's things
that you don't know.

01:19:20.016 --> 01:19:22.821
I'm responsible for her death!

01:19:22.845 --> 01:19:26.152
Let's please meet!
Just let's talk in person.

01:19:28.111 --> 01:19:30.002
Goodbye, Jake.

01:19:30.026 --> 01:19:32.613
I hope you can forgive me.

01:19:32.637 --> 01:19:35.572
And I hope you find the love
you're looking for.

01:19:35.596 --> 01:19:40.012
You didn't kill Maddie!
What?

01:19:40.036 --> 01:19:42.710
You didn't kill her. Where are
you? I will tell you everything.

01:19:42.734 --> 01:19:45.191
There's nothing left
to talk about.

01:19:45.215 --> 01:19:47.933
Yes, there is! There really
is, Brooke. Where are you?

01:19:47.957 --> 01:19:50.762
I'm at a truck stop...

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:54.374
on Lawson and 145th Street.

01:19:54.398 --> 01:19:56.811
Okay. Stay there. I'll be there
in 10 minutes. Don't move.

01:19:56.835 --> 01:19:58.987
Brooke!

01:20:23.209 --> 01:20:26.212
Brooke... are you okay?

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:31.672
Brooke, you scared
the shit out of me!

01:20:35.787 --> 01:20:38.592
You're lying to me.

01:20:38.616 --> 01:20:40.681
You're trying to tell me

01:20:40.705 --> 01:20:42.901
I didn't kill Maddie
so I won't kill myself.

01:20:42.925 --> 01:20:44.903
No. No, no, no. You...

01:20:44.927 --> 01:20:47.059
You are completely innocent, okay?

01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:52.824
I killed Maddie.
What? Why?

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:55.827
Just listen, okay?
Maddie was not your friend.

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:59.308
All she did was keep
accusing you and causing you

01:20:59.332 --> 01:21:01.354
all of this emotional turmoil
that you're feeling.

01:21:01.378 --> 01:21:03.269
So you killed her
because of that?

01:21:03.293 --> 01:21:05.053
No! But I...

01:21:05.077 --> 01:21:08.448
That night at the party,
I saw you

01:21:08.472 --> 01:21:10.667
talking to that moron, Tryg,

01:21:10.691 --> 01:21:14.410
and I got so jealous,

01:21:14.434 --> 01:21:16.673
'cause before we even
got to the party,

01:21:16.697 --> 01:21:19.154
I could feel you
pulling away from me.

01:21:19.178 --> 01:21:21.069
And the first few times, God,

01:21:21.093 --> 01:21:23.791
it was... it was so perfect.

01:21:26.403 --> 01:21:28.642
Then it started to change.

01:21:28.666 --> 01:21:32.167
I don't even get
what you're saying right now.

01:21:32.191 --> 01:21:34.343
I needed to find a way
to prove to you that you could

01:21:34.367 --> 01:21:36.693
trust me, Brooke.
We are perfect for each other.

01:21:36.717 --> 01:21:38.695
So you were trying
to blackmail me?

01:21:38.719 --> 01:21:41.394
No! I needed you
to know that you can trust me!

01:21:41.418 --> 01:21:44.440
And that I can keep your secret.

01:21:44.464 --> 01:21:46.553
Okay?

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:50.882
So, what?

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:53.580
You left and came back, or...
No. I sat

01:21:53.604 --> 01:21:56.235
in my car, and I was thinking.

01:21:56.259 --> 01:21:58.759
And then when I came
back inside to check on you,

01:21:58.783 --> 01:22:00.741
to make sure
that you were all right...

01:22:06.443 --> 01:22:09.465
...I saw Maddie passed out
next to you, and then...

01:22:09.489 --> 01:22:12.144
I realized what I needed to do.

01:22:14.451 --> 01:22:16.603
So you knew you were gonna
kill her that night.

01:22:16.627 --> 01:22:18.735
You took the knife, and you knew
you were gonna do it.

01:22:18.759 --> 01:22:20.737
No! I got the knife
from the kitchen.

01:22:20.761 --> 01:22:23.262
It wasn't pre-planned at all.

01:22:23.286 --> 01:22:26.395
I can't believe
you killed my best friend!

01:22:26.419 --> 01:22:28.267
Brooke, I am

01:22:28.291 --> 01:22:30.269
your best friend!

01:22:30.293 --> 01:22:32.184
I am!

01:22:32.208 --> 01:22:34.621
What do you not get about that?
You tried to frame me

01:22:34.645 --> 01:22:36.753
for murder!
No! I would have never

01:22:36.777 --> 01:22:40.496
let you go to prison for that!
Yeah, as long as I stayed with you!

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.324
Yes! Exactly!

01:22:42.348 --> 01:22:45.240
I knew I was gonna have
to tell you about this night

01:22:45.264 --> 01:22:47.547
at some point, and I had
to tell you tonight

01:22:47.571 --> 01:22:49.636
so that you won't hurt yourself.

01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:51.855
Jake...

01:22:51.879 --> 01:22:54.293
You have to tell the police.

01:22:54.317 --> 01:22:56.295
You have to tell them the truth.
They're going to arrest me!

01:22:56.319 --> 01:22:59.037
They're not! No.

01:22:59.061 --> 01:23:01.343
They don't have
any evidence to convict you.

01:23:01.367 --> 01:23:03.345
You're fine.

01:23:03.369 --> 01:23:05.260
I'm fine.

01:23:05.284 --> 01:23:07.567
Maddie's murder is
gonna go unsolved,

01:23:07.591 --> 01:23:09.569
and then you...

01:23:09.593 --> 01:23:11.788
you and I

01:23:11.812 --> 01:23:14.095
are gonna live
happily ever after,

01:23:14.119 --> 01:23:17.490
anywhere that you want.

01:23:17.514 --> 01:23:19.995
Look at me.

01:23:27.611 --> 01:23:29.850
Jake Campali! Come out
of the car with your hands

01:23:29.874 --> 01:23:32.331
over your head!
You set me up?

01:23:32.355 --> 01:23:34.333
Put the weapon down!
Get out of that car!

01:23:34.357 --> 01:23:36.596
Exit the vehicle
with your hands up!

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:38.990
You really didn't think we'd
give a killer a loaded gun,

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:41.688
did you?
Drop the gun, Jake.

01:23:41.712 --> 01:23:44.758
It's over.

01:23:47.892 --> 01:23:51.524
Drop the gun and get out
of the car slowly!

01:23:51.548 --> 01:23:53.985
Come on, Jake.
Just give it up.

01:24:12.221 --> 01:24:14.982
You okay?

01:24:15.006 --> 01:24:18.551
Yeah.
Brooke!

01:24:18.575 --> 01:24:22.642
You remember
that I did this for you.

01:24:22.666 --> 01:24:25.277
Yeah, and I did this for Maddie!

01:24:27.671 --> 01:24:30.780
Brooke!
Mom!

01:24:30.804 --> 01:24:34.678
Oh, honey... you did it.

01:24:38.116 --> 01:24:40.336
I was so scared.

01:25:12.759 --> 01:25:14.718
I miss you.

01:25:28.775 --> 01:25:31.450
We can get a lot for this.

01:25:31.474 --> 01:25:33.930
Serves the ungrateful punk right

01:25:33.954 --> 01:25:35.976
for not helping me
when I had cancer.

01:25:37.958 --> 01:25:40.111
What kind did you say I had?
Stomach...

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:42.417
I think. Maybe colon.
I can't remember.

01:25:42.441 --> 01:25:44.289
Sorry, I can't

01:25:44.313 --> 01:25:46.334
take your call at the moment.
Please leave me a message.

01:25:46.358 --> 01:25:48.989
Mom, please.

01:25:49.013 --> 01:25:50.904
I really...

01:25:50.928 --> 01:25:53.104
I really need you.

01:25:55.106 --> 01:25:57.171
I'm scared.
