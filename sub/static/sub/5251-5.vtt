WEBVTT

00:04.072 --> 00:05.239
>> CAITLYN: I've come out to all

00:05.239 --> 00:06.240
the girls.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.308
I think it's just harder for my

00:07.308 --> 00:08.309
guy friends.

00:08.309 --> 00:09.310
What do you think?

00:09.310 --> 00:10.511
>> PAM: They're gonna meet

00:10.511 --> 00:11.512
Caitlyn and say, "Same

00:11.512 --> 00:12.513
personality."

00:12.513 --> 00:13.514
>> CAITLYN: I don't know if guys

00:13.514 --> 00:14.515
get that.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.516
>> KYLIE: Hey, pretty.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.517
>> CAITLYN: Hey, baby.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.518
>> KIM: You look beautiful.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.352
>> CAITLYN: Oh, thank you very

00:18.352 --> 00:19.353
much.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.021
They keep saying to me openly

00:21.021 --> 00:22.290
that, "Everybody's great, it's

00:22.290 --> 00:23.191
great, we want you to live

00:23.191 --> 00:23.891
your life."

00:23.891 --> 00:24.692
You never know when they get

00:24.692 --> 00:25.926
away from here and they go home,

00:25.926 --> 00:27.328
they go, "Oh, my God, I don't

00:27.328 --> 00:28.229
know if I really agree

00:28.229 --> 00:29.497
with this."

00:29.497 --> 00:30.964
What we're trying to do is

00:30.964 --> 00:32.600
normalize this as much as we

00:32.600 --> 00:33.734
possibly can.

00:33.734 --> 00:34.735
>> KATE: Part of the reason you

00:34.735 --> 00:36.637
want to is 'cause you don't want

00:36.637 --> 00:39.440
to be a freak.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.441
>> PRODUCER: Scott's here.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.442
>> CAITLYN: Oh, God.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.077
Okay.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.412
I really want to see the

00:44.412 --> 00:46.580
reaction to my, "male

00:46.580 --> 00:48.949
straight friends."

00:48.949 --> 00:50.918
(knocking)

00:53.287 --> 00:54.288
>> CANDIS: I think you should

00:54.288 --> 00:55.923
come to New York.

00:55.923 --> 00:56.924
I'm performing there for Gay

00:56.924 --> 00:57.925
Pride.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.160
What a better way to have

00:59.160 --> 01:02.663
Caitlyn come out to Gay Pride?

01:06.200 --> 01:07.835
>> CHANDI: We don't want Cait to

01:07.835 --> 01:09.437
feel that pressure of feeling

01:09.437 --> 01:10.471
like she's carrying the load for

01:10.471 --> 01:11.472
the community. Yeah.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.207
>> CANDIS: Right. No, for sure.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.208
And our community is desperate

01:14.208 --> 01:15.209
for help.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.578
>> CHANDI: Yes.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.213
>> CAITLYN: I have always

01:19.213 --> 01:21.149
worried about what that first

01:21.149 --> 01:23.251
experience would be like, how

01:23.251 --> 01:25.719
people would react to me.

01:25.719 --> 01:28.356
And here I am going to a very

01:28.356 --> 01:30.558
public outing.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.872
(lively crowd chatter)

01:52.045 --> 01:53.181
>> WOMAN: I think it's an

01:53.181 --> 01:54.382
amazing opportunity that Caitlyn

01:54.382 --> 01:55.683
has to really raise the

01:55.683 --> 01:56.684
narrative and raise the profile

01:56.684 --> 01:57.685
of the trans community as a

01:57.685 --> 01:58.686
whole.

01:58.686 --> 01:59.687
>> MAN: Seeing someone like

01:59.687 --> 02:01.322
Caitlyn Jenner, who is in a

02:01.322 --> 02:03.056
position of acknowledged

02:03.056 --> 02:04.758
privilege, go through this is

02:04.758 --> 02:06.260
very different than the

02:06.260 --> 02:07.761
experience, day-to-day reality

02:07.761 --> 02:09.697
of most of...

02:09.697 --> 02:12.833
The vast 99.9% of trans people

02:12.833 --> 02:13.867
are not having the same

02:13.867 --> 02:15.002
experience as her.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.036
>> WOMAN: I would like to thank

02:16.036 --> 02:18.506
Caitlyn Jenner for raising the

02:18.506 --> 02:21.509
bar and making it that much

02:21.509 --> 02:23.444
harder for an old hag like me.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.845
The bitch is two years older

02:24.845 --> 02:26.046
than I am, and she's absolutely

02:26.046 --> 02:27.315
gorgeous.

02:27.315 --> 02:28.382
Here's somebody that is

02:28.382 --> 02:30.851
familiar, somebody you know,

02:30.851 --> 02:32.453
somebody who was a hero, and

02:32.453 --> 02:33.954
they're going through this.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.088
This person is a human, and not

02:35.088 --> 02:36.690
a monster, and that's what it's

02:36.690 --> 02:38.592
about.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.562
(lively crowd chatter)

02:43.397 --> 02:44.398
>> ZACKARY: Are you having fun

02:44.398 --> 02:45.399
today?

02:45.399 --> 02:46.400
>> CANDIS: I am.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.401
>> ZACKARY: You look like a

02:47.401 --> 02:48.402
vision.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.237
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.238
>> ZACKARY: It's very sandy,

02:50.238 --> 02:51.239
desert, wind and camel zones.

02:51.239 --> 02:52.240
>> WOMAN: It is, isn't it?

02:52.240 --> 02:53.241
>> ZACKARY: Peachy.

02:53.241 --> 02:55.309
>> CANDIS: Oh.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.679
>> CANDIS: Hey.

02:59.913 --> 03:00.981
(phone ringing)

03:00.981 --> 03:01.982
>> JEN: Hey!

03:01.982 --> 03:02.983
>> CAITLYN: Hey!

03:02.983 --> 03:03.984
>> CANDIS: Hey.

03:03.984 --> 03:04.985
>> JEN: Hi!

03:04.985 --> 03:05.986
You look like you're golfing.

03:05.986 --> 03:06.987
>> CAITLYN: I'm in my stealth

03:06.987 --> 03:07.988
mode.

03:07.988 --> 03:08.989
>> CANDIS: Wow.

03:08.989 --> 03:09.990
>> JEN: I didn't recognize you.

03:09.990 --> 03:10.991
>> CANDIS: I know.

03:10.991 --> 03:11.992
>> CAITLYN: Don't worry.

03:11.992 --> 03:12.993
I haven't totally lost it.

03:12.993 --> 03:13.994
>> CANDIS (laughing): Yes.

03:13.994 --> 03:14.995
>> CAITLYN: So, what's

03:14.995 --> 03:15.996
happening?

03:15.996 --> 03:16.997
>> JEN: Well, here, I'll show

03:16.997 --> 03:17.998
you.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.032
I'm gonna flip the camera around

03:19.032 --> 03:20.668
so you can see.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.270
So, this is Trans Pride.

03:22.270 --> 03:22.970
>> CAITLYN: There's a lot

03:22.970 --> 03:23.671
of people there.

03:23.671 --> 03:24.672
>> CANDIS: There are.

03:24.672 --> 03:25.906
>> JEN: They think there's like

03:25.906 --> 03:26.940
800 or 900 today.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.509
>> CAITLYN: Really?

03:28.509 --> 03:29.510
>> JEN: Yeah, it's huge.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.844
It's their biggest one ever.

03:30.844 --> 03:31.879
>> CANDIS: We're missing you.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.180
>> CAITLYN: Any Team Caitlyn

03:33.180 --> 03:35.115
T-shirts?

03:35.115 --> 03:36.484
>> JEN: I don't think I've

03:36.484 --> 03:37.485
noticed.

03:37.485 --> 03:38.486
>> CANDIS: I haven't seen any

03:38.486 --> 03:39.487
yet.

03:39.487 --> 03:40.488
>> JEN: Your 15 minutes is over.

03:40.488 --> 03:41.489
(Candis laughs)

03:41.489 --> 03:43.624
>> CANDIS: I think that's less

03:43.624 --> 03:45.293
of a trans thing and more of

03:45.293 --> 03:47.861
like a-a community, like a gay

03:47.861 --> 03:49.463
community kind of thing.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.564
Wish you could be here today,

03:50.564 --> 03:51.565
though.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.600
>> CAITLYN: It's kind of scary,

03:52.600 --> 03:53.601
because, you know, you're really

03:53.601 --> 03:54.602
exposing yourself.

03:54.602 --> 03:55.603
>> CANDIS: We'll tell everybody

03:55.603 --> 03:56.604
you said hi.

03:56.604 --> 03:57.605
>> CAITLYN: Please do.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.606
Love you.

03:58.606 --> 03:59.607
>> JEN: Love you.

03:59.607 --> 04:00.674
>> CANDIS: All right, love you.

04:00.674 --> 04:01.675
>> JEN: Bye.

04:01.675 --> 04:02.676
>> CANDIS: Bye.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.012
Now especially because of who

04:05.012 --> 04:07.448
Cait is, she has to attend some,

04:07.448 --> 04:10.318
you know, events like this.

04:10.318 --> 04:13.554
Once she gets past this initial

04:13.554 --> 04:16.424
shock of being afraid to go

04:16.424 --> 04:18.392
out in public, it'll be good for

04:18.392 --> 04:19.427
her to make appearances in the

04:19.427 --> 04:23.196
community.

04:23.196 --> 04:25.333
(birds singing)

04:25.333 --> 04:26.334
(knocking)

04:26.334 --> 04:27.167
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God,

04:27.167 --> 04:28.536
just come in.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.203
What are you knocking for?

04:30.203 --> 04:31.204
>> CANDIS: I know. I'm sorry.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.205
>> CAITLYN: Oh, God.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.206
>> CANDIS: You need an escalator

04:33.206 --> 04:34.207
for the front of your house.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.208
>> CAITLYN: You know what?

04:35.208 --> 04:36.209
Honestly, I've already talked to

04:36.209 --> 04:37.210
a guy about putting steps in

04:37.210 --> 04:38.211
there.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.212
It's like almost impossible.

04:39.212 --> 04:40.213
>> CANDIS: It's impossible,

04:40.213 --> 04:41.214
yeah.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.215
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.216
Have a seat.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.217
>> CANDIS: How has it been?

04:44.217 --> 04:45.218
It seems super mellow here.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.219
Like...

04:46.219 --> 04:49.790
>> CAITLYN: Um... it's not easy.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.791
(laughing): A few little

04:50.791 --> 04:51.792
incidents.

04:51.792 --> 04:52.793
>> CANDIS: What do you mean?

04:52.793 --> 04:53.794
>> CAITLYN: You know, a couple

04:53.794 --> 04:55.363
of the kids thought the, like...

04:55.363 --> 04:56.364
the Vanity Fa was a little too

04:56.364 --> 04:57.365
sexy.

04:57.365 --> 04:58.366
Just the guys.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.367
I don't think they get kind of

04:59.367 --> 05:00.434
the girl thing.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.435
You know, like...

05:01.435 --> 05:02.370
>> CANDIS: Yeah, but Cait, like,

05:02.370 --> 05:03.371
you have been...

05:03.371 --> 05:04.372
You have been repressing your

05:04.372 --> 05:05.373
inner woman for so many years.

05:05.373 --> 05:06.374
>> CAITLYN: So many years.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.375
I know.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.476
>> CANDIS: And I understand.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.477
I understand the pushback

05:09.477 --> 05:10.478
because you... you...

05:10.478 --> 05:11.479
>> CAITLYN: I want to respect my

05:11.479 --> 05:12.480
kids.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.481
>> CANDIS: Of course you do.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.482
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

05:14.482 --> 05:15.483
>> CANDIS: And you want them to

05:15.483 --> 05:16.517
respect you, too.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.518
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.519
>> CANDIS: Which is super

05:18.519 --> 05:19.520
important.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.521
>> CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.555
>> CANDIS: But, um, you've been

05:21.555 --> 05:22.556
living the past 40 years taking

05:22.556 --> 05:23.557
care of them and not taking care

05:23.557 --> 05:24.558
of yourself.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.559
>> CAITLYN: I know.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.394
Taking care of them and not

05:26.394 --> 05:27.227
taking care of myself.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.061
Now I'm trying to take care of

05:28.061 --> 05:29.062
myself.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.063
>> CANDIS: Right.

05:30.063 --> 05:30.898
>> CAITLYN: I was thinking...

05:30.898 --> 05:31.732
You know what I ought to do?

05:31.732 --> 05:32.733
I'm gonna do it...

05:32.733 --> 05:33.567
>> CANDIS: I think you should

05:33.567 --> 05:34.568
come to New York.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.403
I'm performing there for Gay

05:35.403 --> 05:36.404
Pride.

05:36.404 --> 05:37.237
What a better way to have

05:37.237 --> 05:40.908
Caitlyn come out to Gay Pride?

05:40.908 --> 05:41.909
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

05:41.909 --> 05:42.910
I-I...

05:42.910 --> 05:45.045
What I wouldn't want is... and,

05:45.045 --> 05:46.046
um...

05:46.046 --> 05:47.915
'Cause my sons, Burt and

05:47.915 --> 05:50.050
Brandon, go, "Oh, going to Gay

05:50.050 --> 05:51.051
Pride?"

05:51.051 --> 05:52.052
This last weekend.

05:52.052 --> 05:55.789
I said, uh, "No, I'm not."

05:55.789 --> 05:57.691
And the reason was not because I

05:57.691 --> 05:58.959
certainly don't support what

05:58.959 --> 06:01.028
they're doing down there, but,

06:01.028 --> 06:02.229
uh, I didn't want it to be a

06:02.229 --> 06:05.433
circus.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.434
Okay?

06:06.434 --> 06:07.468
>> CANDIS: Well, and you

06:07.468 --> 06:09.069
probably don't feel a part of

06:09.069 --> 06:12.039
the community yet.

06:14.908 --> 06:18.546
(birds singing, waves crashing)

06:21.449 --> 06:22.450
>> PRODUCER: Scott's here.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.684
>> CAITLYN: Oh, God.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.052
Okay.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.587
I really invited Scott over for

06:26.587 --> 06:27.588
a couple of reasons.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.022
I want to stay close with my

06:29.022 --> 06:30.591
family members, and Scott still

06:30.591 --> 06:31.959
is part of the family and

06:31.959 --> 06:34.094
will always be because he's the

06:34.094 --> 06:36.163
father of three of my grandkids.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.565
The second reason is, I really

06:37.565 --> 06:39.967
want to see the reaction to my,

06:39.967 --> 06:42.736
"male straight friends,"

06:42.736 --> 06:44.638
and how they're gonna deal with

06:44.638 --> 06:45.939
this situation.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.140
I never really came out with

06:47.140 --> 06:49.209
the guys, you know, been honest

06:49.209 --> 06:51.344
with them, so, kind of going to

06:51.344 --> 06:53.213
take the temperature.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.248
(knocking)

06:55.248 --> 06:58.018
Scott Disick!

07:01.154 --> 07:05.025
(knocking)

07:05.025 --> 07:06.026
>> CAITLYN: Oh.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.696
Here we go.

07:08.696 --> 07:09.897
Scotty's here.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.600
>> SCOTT: Hello... sexy lady.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.601
>> CAITLYN: We're rocking it,

07:13.601 --> 07:14.602
baby.

07:14.602 --> 07:15.603
How we doing?

07:15.603 --> 07:16.604
>> SCOTT: How's it going?

07:16.604 --> 07:17.605
Good to see you...

07:17.605 --> 07:18.606
>> CAITLYN: Good to see you.

07:18.606 --> 07:19.607
I can't believe...

07:19.607 --> 07:20.608
>> SCOTT: ...as you.

07:20.608 --> 07:21.975
>> CAITLYN: I know.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.877
Um... yeah.

07:23.877 --> 07:24.878
Uh, have a seat.

07:24.878 --> 07:25.879
>> SCOTT: The house looks really

07:25.879 --> 07:27.214
great.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.215
I love it.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.216
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.584
>> SCOTT: So how have you been

07:30.584 --> 07:31.585
feeling?

07:31.585 --> 07:32.620
>> CAITLYN: Me?

07:32.620 --> 07:34.154
Like a million pounds are

07:34.154 --> 07:35.689
weight... off your chest... off

07:35.689 --> 07:36.690
your shoulders.

07:36.690 --> 07:37.691
>> SCOTT: Well, it looks like

07:37.691 --> 07:38.692
you got some more weight put on

07:38.692 --> 07:39.693
your chest.

07:39.693 --> 07:40.694
(both laugh)

07:40.694 --> 07:41.862
>> CAITLYN: That's right.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.164
No, it's not easy to be able to,

07:44.164 --> 07:46.967
in the public eye, kind of live

07:46.967 --> 07:48.335
your true self and be who you

07:48.335 --> 07:49.436
are.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.004
What do you think?

07:51.004 --> 07:54.675
Like, what was worrying you?

07:54.675 --> 07:55.743
What were you thinking about

07:55.743 --> 07:59.580
coming over here?

07:59.580 --> 08:01.214
>> SCOTT: Well, it's gonna take

08:01.214 --> 08:02.215
some getting used to, I think,

08:02.215 --> 08:03.216
for everybody.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.217
>> CAITLYN: But I'm still the

08:04.217 --> 08:06.554
same person.

08:06.554 --> 08:07.788
>> SCOTT: But obviously, it's

08:07.788 --> 08:09.823
interesting to look at you,

08:09.823 --> 08:11.158
because, you know, I've never

08:11.158 --> 08:12.259
seen you look like this.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.460
I mean, it's still you, so I'm

08:13.460 --> 08:14.461
not, like, "Who is this person?"

08:14.461 --> 08:15.462
>> CAITLYN: Right.

08:15.462 --> 08:16.463
>> SCOTT: It's still the...

08:16.463 --> 08:17.464
>> CAITLYN: It's just like the

08:17.464 --> 08:18.465
same person with just a little

08:18.465 --> 08:19.466
icing on the cake.

08:19.466 --> 08:20.467
>> SCOTT: Yeah.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.102
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Yeah.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.303
>> SCOTT: A little icing.

08:23.303 --> 08:26.473
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Yeah.

08:26.473 --> 08:27.474
>> SCOTT: I mean, I...

08:27.474 --> 08:29.276
Obviously, I'm just excited for

08:29.276 --> 08:30.277
you to finally have all the

08:30.277 --> 08:31.278
weight lifted off of you.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.279
And, I mean, you look great, you

08:32.279 --> 08:33.280
seem happy.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.281
That's all that matters.

08:34.281 --> 08:35.282
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Yeah.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.284
Um...

08:37.284 --> 08:38.418
You're one of the first guys to

08:38.418 --> 08:39.419
come over.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.487
Mostly all of them have been

08:40.487 --> 08:41.488
women.

08:41.488 --> 08:42.823
Like my buddy Jeff Dunham-- he

08:42.823 --> 08:44.825
has been very supportive, but

08:44.825 --> 08:46.126
hasn't come out and actually met

08:46.126 --> 08:47.127
Caitlyn.

08:47.127 --> 08:50.030
My buddy Dean-- he had no idea.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.364
What do you think from a guy's

08:51.364 --> 08:53.801
perspective?

08:53.801 --> 08:54.802
Because everybody seems to be

08:54.802 --> 08:55.903
very supportive and this and

08:55.903 --> 08:57.270
that.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.271
I don't know. It's just...

08:58.271 --> 08:59.272
a guy thing.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.273
I've just struggled with it, you

09:00.273 --> 09:01.942
know?

09:01.942 --> 09:03.510
>> SCOTT: Well, I mean, I

09:03.510 --> 09:04.812
definitely think it's a lot

09:04.812 --> 09:08.481
different for me...

09:08.481 --> 09:11.018
than a buddy, you know...

09:11.018 --> 09:11.952
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

09:11.952 --> 09:12.920
>> SCOTT: ...because the sense

09:12.920 --> 09:14.121
that, you know, you've been in

09:14.121 --> 09:14.888
my life a long time.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.889
You're a part of my kids' lives.

09:15.889 --> 09:16.890
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

09:16.890 --> 09:17.891
>> SCOTT: So, I mean, to be

09:17.891 --> 09:18.959
completely honest, I don't

09:18.959 --> 09:22.262
know... if every man in the

09:22.262 --> 09:23.997
world is gonna be as comfortable

09:23.997 --> 09:25.165
as I am.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.166
>> CAITLYN: Kind of like the

09:26.166 --> 09:26.767
Kris Humphries...

09:26.767 --> 09:28.368
Did you hear what he said after

09:28.368 --> 09:30.003
the Diane Sawyer piece?

09:30.003 --> 09:31.004
>> SCOTT: No.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.139
>> CAITLYN: Kris "Idiot"

09:32.139 --> 09:34.775
Humphries tweets, "Thank God I

09:34.775 --> 09:36.509
got out of that family in time."

09:36.509 --> 09:37.510
>> SCOTT: Oh.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.779
>> CAITLYN: And just got

09:38.779 --> 09:40.113
absolutely ripped.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.148
>> SCOTT: Oh, my God. I'm sure.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.449
>> CAITLYN: Oh, just ripped.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.851
To where, four hours later, he

09:43.851 --> 09:45.518
had to do an apology.

09:45.518 --> 09:46.553
>> SCOTT: But I only think

09:46.553 --> 09:47.988
that's a short period of time.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.489
You get used to things.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.191
Anybody who's worth being in

09:51.191 --> 09:53.260
your life will understand and

09:53.260 --> 09:56.063
will work at the relationship.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.230
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. I got too many

09:57.230 --> 09:58.231
friends, too many things to do.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.332
>> SCOTT: Right. And too many

09:59.332 --> 10:00.167
people love you.

10:00.167 --> 10:00.868
>> CAITLYN: I don't need haters

10:00.868 --> 10:01.468
in my life.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.402
>> SCOTT: Right. Any negativity.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.103
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Yeah.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.571
>> SCOTT: You've been through

10:04.571 --> 10:06.206
enough, and now's your time to

10:06.206 --> 10:06.907
live it up.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.042
>> CAITLYN: I brought this up to

10:09.042 --> 10:10.110
Brody the other day.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.845
He was on his way to Vegas.

10:11.845 --> 10:12.846
You go up there a lot.

10:12.846 --> 10:13.847
>> SCOTT: Please tell me you

10:13.847 --> 10:14.848
want to host a party.

10:14.848 --> 10:15.849
>> CAITLYN: Yes. And the theme

10:15.849 --> 10:16.850
of the party is Come as Who You

10:16.850 --> 10:17.851
Really Are.

10:17.851 --> 10:18.852
>> SCOTT: Yeah. Perfect!

10:18.852 --> 10:19.853
>> CAITLYN: Can you imagine all

10:19.853 --> 10:20.854
the...

10:20.854 --> 10:21.855
>> SCOTT: I'll close that right

10:21.855 --> 10:22.856
now.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.191
Anybody who's had a struggle not

10:24.191 --> 10:25.959
being themselves...

10:25.959 --> 10:26.994
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

10:26.994 --> 10:27.761
>> SCOTT: ...come on down.

10:27.761 --> 10:28.461
>> CAITLYN: Come on. down.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.663
>> SCOTT: I'll be there.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.331
I can understand why she's so

10:31.331 --> 10:32.866
worried about coming out to her

10:32.866 --> 10:34.401
guy friends, because she

10:34.401 --> 10:36.069
probably feels like other men

10:36.069 --> 10:37.070
could never in a million years

10:37.070 --> 10:38.438
relate to this.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.007
But of course she was fine with

10:40.007 --> 10:42.810
me coming over...

10:42.810 --> 10:46.013
so that makes me... question

10:46.013 --> 10:47.047
myself.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.048
Well, it was good to see you.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.049
Give me a good old hand hug.

10:49.049 --> 10:49.883
And then we'll go in for the

10:49.883 --> 10:50.617
real thing.

10:50.617 --> 10:51.384
Good to see you.

10:51.384 --> 10:52.052
>> CAITLYN: You got it.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.053
Good seeing you.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.054
Thanks for coming out.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.055
>> SCOTT: Okay, call me soon.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.056
I'm around.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.057
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.058
>> SCOTT: I love the house.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.059
See you.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.194
>> CAITLYN: See you.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.964
Kind of a crazy day.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.933
(gulls squawking)

11:08.201 --> 11:11.104
(line ringing)

11:11.104 --> 11:12.139
>> SERGIO: Hello.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.440
>> CAITLYN: Sergio, did you

11:13.440 --> 11:14.775
change my name in your, uh,

11:14.775 --> 11:16.143
Rolodex?

11:16.143 --> 11:18.078
>> SERGIO: Of course I did.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.847
>> CAITLYN: Of course you did.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.850
You're... That's great.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.084
>> SERGIO: My phone just said,

11:24.084 --> 11:25.853
"Caitlyn Jenner called you."

11:25.853 --> 11:27.320
>> CAITLYN: I like that.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.455
It really did?

11:28.455 --> 11:29.456
>> SERGIO: My wife is jealous

11:29.456 --> 11:30.457
now.

11:30.457 --> 11:31.458
I told her I have a hot friend.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.492
She's like... (indistinct)

11:32.492 --> 11:35.095
(laughing)

11:35.095 --> 11:36.363
>> CAITLYN: That's great.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.530
That's great. That's good.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.266
Well, here's my dilemma.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.533
I'm looking at my poor little

11:40.533 --> 11:42.402
helicopters, and, my 600, one of

11:42.402 --> 11:43.971
the servos went while I was

11:43.971 --> 11:45.773
flying and it kind of went in.

11:45.773 --> 11:46.774
Uh, what are you doing over the

11:46.774 --> 11:47.775
next couple of days?

11:47.775 --> 11:49.076
Could you sneak out here?

11:49.076 --> 11:50.510
'Cause I kind of have a hard

11:50.510 --> 11:51.845
time getting in there.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.280
>> SERGIO: Yeah, I can.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.281
>> CAITLYN: Oh, very good.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.615
I'm gonna look at my schedule.

11:55.615 --> 11:56.616
>> SERGIO: Yeah. Let me know so

11:56.616 --> 11:57.617
we can arrange it.

11:57.617 --> 11:58.618
>> CAITLYN: Okay. Yeah, and

11:58.618 --> 11:59.787
I'll-I'll give you directions on

11:59.787 --> 12:00.821
how to get here.

12:00.821 --> 12:01.822
>> SERGIO: Okay.

12:01.822 --> 12:02.890
>> CAITLYN: Till then.

12:02.890 --> 12:03.891
>> SERGIO: Take care.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.092
>> CAITLYN: Okay, bye.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.594
He even changed his phone to

12:07.594 --> 12:10.798
"Caitlyn."

12:10.798 --> 12:12.465
Sergio's a very good friend.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.867
Never met Caitlyn, obviously.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.869
I think he had kind of figured

12:15.869 --> 12:17.004
it out, but nobody would ever

12:17.004 --> 12:18.271
talk about it.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.639
And the guys at the heli-field

12:19.639 --> 12:20.974
have all said, "Well, is she

12:20.974 --> 12:21.975
coming out?"

12:21.975 --> 12:23.310
You know? "Is she gonna come fly

12:23.310 --> 12:24.411
helicopters with us?"

12:24.411 --> 12:26.146
Um, you know, I could be the

12:26.146 --> 12:27.848
best female helicopter pilot out

12:27.848 --> 12:28.849
there.

12:28.849 --> 12:29.850
This-this... I could, you know,

12:29.850 --> 12:30.851
go to the top here.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.085
So, anyway, Sergio's gonna come

12:32.085 --> 12:33.353
out.

12:33.353 --> 12:37.024
Great guy, a lot of fun.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.992
(birds chirping)

12:44.364 --> 12:45.933
The doors have opened.

12:45.933 --> 12:46.934
(Candis chuckles)

12:46.934 --> 12:47.935
Hello. How are you?

12:47.935 --> 12:49.336
>> SARAH: Hi. Sarah Kate Ellis.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.603
>> CAITLYN: Nice to meet you.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.205
Yes, we hug around here.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.240
>> SARAH: I know. (chuckles)

12:53.240 --> 12:54.407
So nice to meet you.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.608
And you know Nick Adams.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.609
>> NICK: Yes.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.677
>> SARAH: At GLAAD, we

12:57.677 --> 12:58.879
accelerate acceptance for the

12:58.879 --> 13:01.081
LGBT community through media,

13:01.081 --> 13:02.482
through positive portrayals.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.217
And the more people know trans

13:04.217 --> 13:05.919
people and the issues that they

13:05.919 --> 13:07.554
face, the more accepting they

13:07.554 --> 13:09.356
become, and it creates a safer

13:09.356 --> 13:11.258
environment for everyone.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.292
>> CAITLYN: It seems like every

13:12.292 --> 13:13.326
time I saw anything, you guys

13:13.326 --> 13:14.394
had my back, and I certainly

13:14.394 --> 13:15.728
appreciated that.

13:15.728 --> 13:16.997
>> SARAH: We tried. And Nick

13:16.997 --> 13:18.966
worked endlessly, tirelessly,

13:18.966 --> 13:20.200
especially with the... uh, the

13:20.200 --> 13:21.701
tabloid press.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.270
>> CAITLYN: Oh, God. Yes.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.271
>> NICK: Well, we put out a

13:24.271 --> 13:25.272
style guide, like, how, for

13:25.272 --> 13:26.273
journalists, to report

13:26.273 --> 13:27.374
respectfully about Caitlyn

13:27.374 --> 13:28.441
Jenner, and it was viewed

13:28.441 --> 13:30.310
200,000 times in 24 hours.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.644
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I-I know.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.679
>> NICK: So we got a lot of

13:32.679 --> 13:33.513
traffic saying, like, "How do

13:33.513 --> 13:34.281
we write about this?"

13:34.281 --> 13:35.215
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. No, it-it

13:35.215 --> 13:36.749
was... it was amazing to me.

13:36.749 --> 13:37.985
Yeah.

13:37.985 --> 13:38.986
>> SARAH: I think something that

13:38.986 --> 13:40.587
people don't realize is that, in

13:40.587 --> 13:42.555
the media, it's taboo to out

13:42.555 --> 13:44.457
people if they're gay.

13:44.457 --> 13:47.027
And if you're trans, however,

13:47.027 --> 13:48.661
it's fair game.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.964
And we kept trying to remind the

13:50.964 --> 13:53.133
media that this is actually

13:53.133 --> 13:55.035
creating a really dangerous

13:55.035 --> 13:56.236
environment out there.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.171
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I agree.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.907
>> NICK: I transitioned in 1997

13:59.907 --> 14:01.808
and I still find myself learning

14:01.808 --> 14:02.910
new things about the trans

14:02.910 --> 14:04.111
community every time I meet

14:04.111 --> 14:05.445
someone new, because we're an

14:05.445 --> 14:07.147
incredibly diverse community.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.215
>> CAITLYN: Incredibly.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.249
>> NICK: Depending on when we

14:09.249 --> 14:10.918
transitioned, at what age, which

14:10.918 --> 14:13.020
way we're going, where we grew

14:13.020 --> 14:14.487
up, you know, whether we're...

14:14.487 --> 14:16.023
what our sexual orientation is.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.257
I mean, there's... whether

14:17.257 --> 14:18.658
people of color and everybody's

14:18.658 --> 14:19.927
experience is so incredibly

14:19.927 --> 14:20.928
different.

14:20.928 --> 14:21.661
>> CAITLYN: And you know what I

14:21.661 --> 14:24.064
found out, like, uh, first is

14:24.064 --> 14:27.700
they're all just so damn normal.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.036
(Nick chuckles)

14:29.036 --> 14:30.403
No, they really are.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.171
>> SARAH: No, they're nothing

14:31.171 --> 14:31.838
scary.

14:31.838 --> 14:32.672
>> CAITLYN: They've been through

14:32.672 --> 14:33.773
incredible things to get where

14:33.773 --> 14:34.942
they are.

14:34.942 --> 14:35.708
>> SARAH: Well, they're

14:35.708 --> 14:36.376
incredible, yeah.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.044
>> CAITLYN: I mean, you hear

14:37.044 --> 14:37.777
these stories and you can't

14:37.777 --> 14:39.046
believe that all these girls

14:39.046 --> 14:41.214
were just, like, now, so normal.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.050
And so much fun and want to

14:43.050 --> 14:44.451
enjoy life and...

14:44.451 --> 14:45.818
I'm trying to make sure we

14:45.818 --> 14:47.287
project them that way, like

14:47.287 --> 14:48.355
they're not freaks, they're not

14:48.355 --> 14:49.756
freaks of nature and this and

14:49.756 --> 14:51.491
that.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.027
>> CANDIS: We're... we're not.

14:54.027 --> 14:57.830
It's hard to hear her say "them"

14:57.830 --> 14:59.066
and "they" when she talks about

14:59.066 --> 15:00.433
the trans community.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.202
She still can't grasp the

15:02.202 --> 15:04.437
concept that she's a part of our

15:04.437 --> 15:05.505
community.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.340
Maybe it's because she's been

15:07.340 --> 15:09.642
outside looking in for so many

15:09.642 --> 15:13.013
years that she refers to us as

15:13.013 --> 15:14.047
"they."

15:14.047 --> 15:15.115
But then, at the same time,

15:15.115 --> 15:16.149
people are going to look at that

15:16.149 --> 15:18.818
in, in a snobby kind of way,

15:18.818 --> 15:21.054
because it isolates her from her

15:21.054 --> 15:23.991
own community.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.892
(birds singing)

15:28.795 --> 15:31.298
Wow, what a view, Caitlyn.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.432
>> CAITLYN: Do you like this?

15:32.432 --> 15:33.166
This is kind of different.

15:33.166 --> 15:33.866
>> CANDIS: I love it.

15:33.866 --> 15:34.601
>> CAITLYN: Kind of Malibu chic.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.268
>> CANDIS: Yes.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.003
>> CAITLYN: I bought it

15:36.003 --> 15:36.603
yesterday.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.171
I-I actually went shopping.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.006
With Courtney.

15:39.006 --> 15:39.739
>> CANDIS: I love that.

15:39.739 --> 15:40.773
Oh, wait, which Courtney?

15:40.773 --> 15:42.275
Your daughter Kourtney?

15:42.275 --> 15:43.010
>> CAITLYN: No.

15:43.010 --> 15:43.710
>> CANDIS: Oh.

15:43.710 --> 15:44.377
>> CAITLYN: I talked to her,

15:44.377 --> 15:45.045
too.

15:45.045 --> 15:45.712
>> CANDIS: You did?

15:45.712 --> 15:46.513
>> CAITLYN: But... yes.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.214
>> CANDIS: Is she doing okay?

15:47.214 --> 15:48.015
>> CAITLYN: Is she doing okay?

15:48.015 --> 15:49.416
She's doing as well as she can

15:49.416 --> 15:51.251
do under the circumstances.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.019
It's obviously very tough on

15:52.019 --> 15:53.020
her.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.021
>> CANDIS: No, of course.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.788
>> CAITLYN: So, um, obviously

15:55.788 --> 15:57.324
Scott has a lot of issues and

15:57.324 --> 15:58.325
she's trying to deal with them

15:58.325 --> 15:59.326
the best she can.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.127
And she's got three kids with

16:00.127 --> 16:01.328
him and...

16:01.328 --> 16:02.462
She'll be okay.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.463
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.597
>> CAITLYN: Relationships aren't

16:04.597 --> 16:06.333
easy.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.534
>> CANDIS: They're not easy.

16:07.534 --> 16:08.835
At all.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.170
>> CAITLYN: At all.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.838
>> CHANDI: How's my girls?

16:11.838 --> 16:12.639
>> CANDIS: Hi.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.373
>> CHANDI: Wow!

16:13.373 --> 16:14.041
>> CANDIS: Wow.

16:14.041 --> 16:14.741
>> CAITLYN: Doing great, baby.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.709
How are you doing, babe?

16:16.709 --> 16:17.710
>> CANDIS: Oh...

16:17.710 --> 16:18.445
>> CAITLYN: How you doing, babe?

16:18.445 --> 16:19.112
>> CANDIS: We ordered you a

16:19.112 --> 16:19.612
margarita.

16:19.612 --> 16:20.413
>> CHANDI: Oh, well, you did the

16:20.413 --> 16:21.214
right thing.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.115
>> CAITLYN: Good, yeah, I know,

16:22.115 --> 16:23.050
we were thinking about that,

16:23.050 --> 16:23.850
yeah.

16:23.850 --> 16:24.751
I haven't seen you in a while,

16:24.751 --> 16:25.485
babe, how have you been?

16:25.485 --> 16:26.153
>> CHANDI: I know. Good.

16:26.153 --> 16:26.819
How are you?

16:26.819 --> 16:27.920
>> CAITLYN: I'm doing great.

16:27.920 --> 16:28.688
What did you think of the GLAAD

16:28.688 --> 16:29.889
meeting today?

16:29.889 --> 16:30.757
>> CANDIS: It was good.

16:30.757 --> 16:31.624
>> CAITLYN: I thought it was

16:31.624 --> 16:32.492
really... I liked them.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.293
>> CANDIS: I thought they're...

16:33.293 --> 16:34.494
they're on their (bleep), excuse

16:34.494 --> 16:35.495
my French.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.163
>> CAITLYN: Oh, they, they,

16:36.163 --> 16:36.829
yeah, they got their stuff.

16:36.829 --> 16:37.697
They've got their act together.

16:37.697 --> 16:38.598
They know what they're doing.

16:38.598 --> 16:39.532
>> CANDIS: It's amazing.

16:39.532 --> 16:40.567
>> CHANDI: So are you starting

16:40.567 --> 16:43.070
to feel as if you are a part of

16:43.070 --> 16:46.806
this community?

16:46.806 --> 16:48.308
>> CAITLYN: Yes.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.543
Um, I have learned-- because of

16:50.543 --> 16:51.544
you guys...

16:51.544 --> 16:52.545
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.780
>> CAITLYN: ...so much.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.115
>> CANDIS: But sometimes, when

16:55.115 --> 16:56.616
you do say "them" and "they,"

16:56.616 --> 16:59.486
it's like you're not including

16:59.486 --> 17:01.088
yourself in that group of

17:01.088 --> 17:02.089
people.

17:02.089 --> 17:02.689
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.556
>> CANDIS: But you're... you're

17:03.556 --> 17:04.857
one of us.

17:04.857 --> 17:05.858
>> CHANDI: The world needs to

17:05.858 --> 17:08.195
feel as if you are inclusive of

17:08.195 --> 17:09.729
our community.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.898
So it's totally... one of those

17:11.898 --> 17:15.735
things where you have to start

17:15.735 --> 17:18.471
embracing the word "we."

17:18.471 --> 17:20.440
We can start there.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.113
*

17:26.113 --> 17:27.280
>> CHANDI: The world needs to

17:27.280 --> 17:30.217
feel as if you are inclusive of

17:30.217 --> 17:31.784
our community.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.887
So it's totally... one of those

17:34.887 --> 17:37.324
things where you have to start

17:37.324 --> 17:39.859
embracing the word "we."

17:39.859 --> 17:41.828
We can start there.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.765
Because when you say "they" or

17:45.765 --> 17:49.436
"them" to girls who have been on

17:49.436 --> 17:51.138
the streets, they don't feel

17:51.138 --> 17:53.140
included.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.774
As you continue, I need you to

17:54.774 --> 17:57.444
say "we" and not "they" and not

17:57.444 --> 17:58.778
"them," because they want to

17:58.778 --> 18:00.147
feel like you're a part of their

18:00.147 --> 18:01.181
struggle.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.515
>> CAITLYN: A part of that.

18:02.515 --> 18:03.850
>> CHANDI: Regardless of whether

18:03.850 --> 18:05.518
or not you know what that looks

18:05.518 --> 18:07.520
like, because have you ever

18:07.520 --> 18:09.189
thought about if-if there was no

18:09.189 --> 18:12.192
one around, no security, no

18:12.192 --> 18:14.194
nothing, and you just walked

18:14.194 --> 18:16.863
outside alone, by yourself, how

18:16.863 --> 18:18.531
would that be for you?

18:18.531 --> 18:19.866
>> CAITLYN: Tough.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.868
Tough.

18:21.868 --> 18:26.539
Um, I have had a hard time even

18:26.539 --> 18:27.540
with myself...

18:27.540 --> 18:28.875
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.210
>> CAITLYN: ...identifying

18:30.210 --> 18:31.878
myself as me and who I am.

18:31.878 --> 18:32.879
>> CHANDI: Right.

18:32.879 --> 18:33.880
>> CANDIS: Right.

18:33.880 --> 18:34.881
>> CAITLYN: Okay? It's tough.

18:34.881 --> 18:35.548
>> CANDIS: It is tough.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.549
>> CHANDI: It's-it's not easy.

18:36.549 --> 18:37.550
>> CAITLYN: Because I have for

18:37.550 --> 18:38.218
all these years...

18:38.218 --> 18:39.219
>> CANDIS: Because in your eyes,

18:39.219 --> 18:40.220
they were "them" and "they."

18:40.220 --> 18:41.221
>> CAITLYN: ...she's been, they

18:41.221 --> 18:41.888
were the... they were the

18:41.888 --> 18:42.889
outside, not the inside.

18:42.889 --> 18:43.556
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.557
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

18:44.557 --> 18:45.558
>> CAITLYN: I find myself all

18:45.558 --> 18:47.227
the time, uh, kind of falling

18:47.227 --> 18:48.561
back into that rut.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.562
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.563
>> CANDIS: Yeah, we want the

18:50.563 --> 18:51.564
outside world...

18:51.564 --> 18:52.565
>> CAITLYN: Right.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.566
>> CANDIS: ...to embrace every

18:53.566 --> 18:54.567
aspect of you, uh...

18:54.567 --> 18:55.568
>> CHANDI: The way we do.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.569
>> CANDIS: ...the way we do.

18:56.569 --> 18:57.570
>> CAITLYN: Here's to "we."

18:57.570 --> 18:58.571
>> CHANDI: Yes, to "we."

18:58.571 --> 18:59.572
>> CANDIS: Here's to "we" and

18:59.572 --> 19:00.240
"us."

19:00.240 --> 19:01.308
>> CAITLYN: Here's to "we."

19:01.308 --> 19:01.974
I'm here.

19:01.974 --> 19:02.975
>> CANDIS: And not "them" and

19:02.975 --> 19:03.643
"they."

19:03.643 --> 19:04.644
>> CHANDI: And-and we're going

19:04.644 --> 19:05.645
to figure out how we're going to

19:05.645 --> 19:06.979
begin to work that into our

19:06.979 --> 19:07.980
repertoire.

19:07.980 --> 19:08.981
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.950
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

19:15.922 --> 19:16.923
>> CAITLYN: We got plenty of

19:16.923 --> 19:17.924
battery there.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.592
Battery charged there.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.261
>> PRODUCER: Should we call

19:21.261 --> 19:22.595
Sergio and make sure he didn't

19:22.595 --> 19:23.930
get lost?

19:23.930 --> 19:24.931
>> CAITLYN: I'm sure he'll be

19:24.931 --> 19:26.933
fine.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.601
The guy friends.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.603
I've text...

19:30.603 --> 19:32.272
Uh, I've talked to 'em on the

19:32.272 --> 19:33.606
phone, pretty much sound the

19:33.606 --> 19:34.941
same thing, sounds like old, you

19:34.941 --> 19:36.276
know, good old whatever his name

19:36.276 --> 19:37.277
was.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.612
But meeting you is a whole

19:39.612 --> 19:41.581
different story.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.287
This one has a boo-boo.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.256
We'll give that one to Sergio.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.926
He's the doctor.

19:56.963 --> 19:57.964
(humming)

19:57.964 --> 19:59.932
Where is he?

20:06.306 --> 20:07.974
This is the last text he had,

20:07.974 --> 20:09.309
but I didn't hear anything after

20:09.309 --> 20:10.643
that.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.612
Can you make it?

20:17.317 --> 20:18.651
It looks like this is the first

20:18.651 --> 20:20.653
time I've been stood up.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.622
He would have been here by now.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.361
(crowd cheering)

20:28.361 --> 20:29.362
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA: This morning

20:29.362 --> 20:30.363
the Supreme Court recognized

20:30.363 --> 20:32.365
that the Constitution guarantees

20:32.365 --> 20:34.367
marriage equality, regardless of

20:34.367 --> 20:36.703
who they are or who they love.

20:36.703 --> 20:37.704
>> REPORTER: For the first time,

20:37.704 --> 20:39.038
the Supreme Court has said there

20:39.038 --> 20:41.374
is a constitutional right for

20:41.374 --> 20:42.709
same-sex marriage.

20:42.709 --> 20:43.710
You can hear the cheer in the

20:43.710 --> 20:45.378
crowd, a very dramatic moment

20:45.378 --> 20:47.046
here, a 5-4 decision.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.381
>> CAITLYN: What a day.

20:48.381 --> 20:51.050
This is a monumental week for

20:51.050 --> 20:53.052
the LGBT community.

20:53.052 --> 20:57.056
Just found out the Supreme Court

20:57.056 --> 20:59.726
just passed same-sex marriage.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.060
Good for all the people out

21:01.060 --> 21:02.128
there.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.796
It just shows you how far the

21:03.796 --> 21:05.798
gay issue has come in so many

21:05.798 --> 21:07.133
ways.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.802
The trans issue, the "T," um, we

21:09.802 --> 21:11.804
still have a long ways to go.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.139
The trans issue's probably 20

21:13.139 --> 21:14.474
years behind.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.142
Um, we've got a lot of decisions

21:16.142 --> 21:17.810
and a lot of things that we have

21:17.810 --> 21:19.479
to get passed, too.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.813
So, uh, good step in the right

21:20.813 --> 21:21.814
direction.

21:21.814 --> 21:22.815
I'm actually... I am off to New

21:22.815 --> 21:26.152
York, and, uh, for Gay Pride

21:26.152 --> 21:27.487
Week.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.489
Uh, it's going to be, after this

21:29.489 --> 21:33.159
decision, quite a party.

21:33.159 --> 21:34.494
Might be a little overwhelming,

21:34.494 --> 21:35.828
but it's gonna be quite a party.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.497
It'd be fun to see Candis, too.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.832
She's performing in New York, so

21:39.832 --> 21:42.168
I'll have to look into that.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.503
>> CANDIS: Just your mere

21:43.503 --> 21:45.838
presence of coming to the event

21:45.838 --> 21:47.840
will be a huge thing for the

21:47.840 --> 21:48.841
community.

21:48.841 --> 21:49.842
>> CAITLYN: I mean, I've never

21:49.842 --> 21:52.512
been that out and that exposed

21:52.512 --> 21:54.180
in my life.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.181
It's kind of scary.

21:55.181 --> 21:56.182
>> CANDIS: No, it is.

21:56.182 --> 21:57.183
I get that.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.184
>> CAITLYN: Big time scary.

21:58.184 --> 21:59.185
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.520
>> CAITLYN: Eventually, it'll be

22:00.520 --> 22:02.589
part of everyday life, but I,

22:02.589 --> 22:04.256
you know, I need to get out

22:04.256 --> 22:05.257
there.

22:05.257 --> 22:06.258
How are we doing on a plane?

22:06.258 --> 22:07.927
>> RONDA: Uh, oh, the plane.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.929
It's all taken care of.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.598
Wheels Up.

22:11.598 --> 22:12.599
>> CAITLYN: Wheels up?

22:12.599 --> 22:13.600
(chuckles)

22:13.600 --> 22:14.601
>> RONDA: Kenny D.

22:14.601 --> 22:15.602
>> CAITLYN: Oh, yeah, Kenny

22:15.602 --> 22:16.603
Dichter from Wheels Up.

22:16.603 --> 22:17.604
Actually, I met him at the golf

22:17.604 --> 22:18.605
course.

22:18.605 --> 22:19.606
>> RONDA: They were very, very

22:19.606 --> 22:20.272
accommodating, so...

22:20.272 --> 22:21.273
>> CAITLYN: Oh. Good.

22:21.273 --> 22:22.274
>> RONDA: I did not know that

22:22.274 --> 22:22.942
you knew them.

22:22.942 --> 22:23.943
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Yeah.

22:23.943 --> 22:24.944
>> RONDA: So that's good, you

22:24.944 --> 22:25.612
know?

22:25.612 --> 22:26.613
>> CAITLYN: Well, that's good.

22:26.613 --> 22:27.279
I'm glad we're using them.

22:27.279 --> 22:28.280
Well, I'm very excited about

22:28.280 --> 22:28.948
your show.

22:28.948 --> 22:29.949
>> CANDIS: I think it'll be fun.

22:29.949 --> 22:30.950
>> RONDA: Well, so, guys, I...

22:30.950 --> 22:31.951
>> CAITLYN: I've never...

22:31.951 --> 22:32.885
Everybody is funny, because

22:32.885 --> 22:33.886
everybody knows you for your

22:33.886 --> 22:34.887
show...

22:34.887 --> 22:35.888
>> CANDIS: Right.

22:35.888 --> 22:36.889
>> CAITLYN: ...and I've never

22:36.889 --> 22:37.890
seen your show.

22:37.890 --> 22:38.891
Can you still kick it as high as

22:38.891 --> 22:39.892
you used to?

22:39.892 --> 22:40.560
(Ronda and Candis chuckle)

22:40.560 --> 22:41.561
>> CANDIS: Not-not as high.

22:41.561 --> 22:42.562
>> RONDA: Come on, let's...

22:42.562 --> 22:43.563
I saw you the other day, come

22:43.563 --> 22:44.230
on.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.231
>> CANDIS: No, I mean, and I'm

22:45.231 --> 22:45.898
not warmed up.

22:45.898 --> 22:46.899
>> CAITLYN: But that's true.

22:46.899 --> 22:47.567
>> RONDA: Oh, all right, all

22:47.567 --> 22:48.568
right, let's just-just see how

22:48.568 --> 22:49.569
you do it without warming up.

22:49.569 --> 22:50.570
>> CAITLYN: Don't hurt yourself,

22:50.570 --> 22:51.237
damn it.

22:51.237 --> 22:52.238
>> CANDIS: I know, uh, I just...

22:52.238 --> 22:52.905
>> RONDA: In heels?!

22:52.905 --> 22:53.906
>> CAITLYN: Wait a second, not

22:53.906 --> 22:54.574
in those shoes.

22:54.574 --> 22:55.575
Do you want to take those shoes

22:55.575 --> 22:56.242
off?

22:56.242 --> 22:57.243
>> CANDIS: No, I don't want to

22:57.243 --> 22:57.910
take my shoes off.

22:57.910 --> 22:58.911
>> RONDA: What the heck?!

22:58.911 --> 22:59.579
Do it again.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.580
>> CANDIS: ...a little bit of...

23:00.580 --> 23:01.648
>> RONDA: ...the sexiest ever.

23:01.648 --> 23:02.314
>> CAITLYN: Wow. Wow.

23:02.314 --> 23:03.315
Do it one more time for camera.

23:03.315 --> 23:04.316
>> RONDA: Please one more time.

23:04.316 --> 23:05.317
>> CAITLYN: There you go, that's

23:05.317 --> 23:06.318
good.

23:06.318 --> 23:08.287
(Candis laughs)

23:10.322 --> 23:11.323
(phone line rings)

23:11.323 --> 23:12.324
Let's see if he's even gonna

23:12.324 --> 23:14.661
answer.

23:14.661 --> 23:15.995
He didn't answer his other

23:15.995 --> 23:17.997
phone.

23:17.997 --> 23:18.998
>> SERGIO: Hello?

23:18.998 --> 23:19.999
>> CAITLYN: Sergio.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.000
>> SERGIO: Yes?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.334
>> CAITLYN: It's Caitlyn.

23:22.334 --> 23:23.335
>> SERGIO: Hey!

23:23.335 --> 23:24.671
>> CAITLYN: What's happening?

23:24.671 --> 23:26.005
>> SERGIO: Not much.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.007
>> CAITLYN: Here's the deal.

23:28.007 --> 23:31.678
My little 600 got a boo-boo.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.345
It needs a little massaging.

23:33.345 --> 23:35.347
I was thinking about coming in.

23:35.347 --> 23:36.348
>> SERGIO: Okay.

23:36.348 --> 23:37.349
>> CAITLYN: I really like

23:37.349 --> 23:38.350
Sergio.

23:38.350 --> 23:39.351
I understand that he might be a

23:39.351 --> 23:40.687
little apprehensive in meeting

23:40.687 --> 23:41.688
me now.

23:41.688 --> 23:42.689
I mean, we were good friends for

23:42.689 --> 23:43.690
many years.

23:43.690 --> 23:44.691
You know, I'm not gonna call him

23:44.691 --> 23:45.692
out for not showing up.

23:45.692 --> 23:47.026
>> SERGIO: What-what do you

23:47.026 --> 23:48.027
think?

23:48.027 --> 23:49.028
>> CAITLYN: I don't know, I look

23:49.028 --> 23:50.029
pretty good.

23:50.029 --> 23:51.030
I think you can handle it.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.031
>> SERGIO: There you go.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.365
>> CAITLYN: There you go.

23:53.365 --> 23:56.368
I have to admit, when it comes

23:56.368 --> 24:01.040
to my male friends, um, and

24:01.040 --> 24:03.776
meeting them... been kind of

24:03.776 --> 24:05.778
dragging my feet, but friendship

24:05.778 --> 24:08.114
is a two-way street, so I just

24:08.114 --> 24:09.516
decided I'm going over to the

24:09.516 --> 24:11.117
hobby shop for the first time in

24:11.117 --> 24:12.785
six months.

24:12.785 --> 24:16.122
(engine revs)

24:16.122 --> 24:17.524
I would just like to get life

24:17.524 --> 24:19.425
back to normal, that's all.

24:32.839 --> 24:33.840
>> PRODUCER: How do you feel

24:33.840 --> 24:34.841
about meeting Cait?

24:34.841 --> 24:37.844
Do you have any nerves about it?

24:37.844 --> 24:40.179
>> SERGIO: I don't know, I'm...

24:40.179 --> 24:41.548
Uh, kind of.

24:41.548 --> 24:42.549
>> PRODUCER: Yeah.

24:42.549 --> 24:44.183
>> SERGIO: Like, you know, it's

24:44.183 --> 24:46.185
the first time I kind of,

24:46.185 --> 24:47.186
like... I-I'm confused.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.187
>> PRODUCER: Right.

24:48.187 --> 24:49.188
>> SERGIO: We were shocked like

24:49.188 --> 24:50.189
everybody else.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.558
But I guess we will get used to

24:51.558 --> 24:53.560
it.

24:55.862 --> 24:56.863
She's here?

24:56.863 --> 24:58.865
>> PRODUCER: Yeah, she's here.

24:58.865 --> 24:59.866
>> CAITLYN: As of right now,

24:59.866 --> 25:01.200
I've just met with a lot of very

25:01.200 --> 25:03.269
positive people, and I certainly

25:03.269 --> 25:04.937
hope that continues.

25:04.937 --> 25:07.273
But you always wonder.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.275
What will their reaction be?

25:09.275 --> 25:11.277
Are they going to be accepting?

25:11.277 --> 25:12.945
'Cause I hope at some point that

25:12.945 --> 25:14.614
somebody doesn't turn on me.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.616
I'm scared, I'm skeptical and,

25:16.616 --> 25:19.251
you know, gonna do my best.

25:21.954 --> 25:24.624
How bad did you miss me?

25:24.624 --> 25:26.593
Well, things haven't changed.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.930
>> SERGIO: Sure.

25:40.907 --> 25:41.908
>> CAITLYN: How bad did you miss

25:41.908 --> 25:43.610
me?

25:43.610 --> 25:45.612
Well, things haven't changed.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.882
>> SERGIO: Sure.

25:55.922 --> 25:56.923
>> CAITLYN: So what have I

25:56.923 --> 25:57.924
missed?

25:57.924 --> 25:59.626
What's new?

25:59.626 --> 26:00.627
>> SERGIO: Not much.

26:00.627 --> 26:01.661
>> CAITLYN: No?

26:01.661 --> 26:02.662
>> SERGIO: Everything's the

26:02.662 --> 26:03.663
same.

26:03.663 --> 26:04.664
>> CAITLYN: Same old, same old?

26:04.664 --> 26:05.665
>> SERGIO: Same old, same old.

26:05.665 --> 26:06.666
>> CAITLYN: Well, me, too.

26:06.666 --> 26:07.667
I haven't... Nothing's going on

26:07.667 --> 26:08.668
with me.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.002
(Sergio chuckles)

26:10.002 --> 26:11.671
Uh, but anyway, I think all the

26:11.671 --> 26:13.005
servos are good on this.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.340
'Cause it came down hard, it

26:14.340 --> 26:15.341
went all... hell started

26:15.341 --> 26:16.342
breaking loose.

26:16.342 --> 26:17.343
I got it down, landed it.

26:17.343 --> 26:18.344
I got tall grass, landed in the

26:18.344 --> 26:19.345
tall grass.

26:19.345 --> 26:20.346
But it was flying good till it

26:20.346 --> 26:21.347
crashed.

26:21.347 --> 26:22.815
So have you heard from Dunham?

26:22.815 --> 26:23.950
>> SERGIO: I was talking to him

26:23.950 --> 26:24.751
earlier today.

26:24.751 --> 26:25.685
>> CAITLYN: Oh, God.

26:25.685 --> 26:26.418
>> SERGIO: I-I would...

26:26.418 --> 26:27.253
>> CAITLYN: He's, like, my next

26:27.253 --> 26:28.020
one.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.088
He keeps talking about coming

26:29.088 --> 26:30.890
out to the house, but he never

26:30.890 --> 26:33.860
seems to quite get it done.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.928
It is what it is.

26:35.928 --> 26:36.863
Sergio...

26:36.863 --> 26:37.864
>> SERGIO: What-what matters is

26:37.864 --> 26:38.665
your happiness.

26:38.665 --> 26:39.331
You're happy?

26:39.331 --> 26:40.032
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I'm happy.

26:40.032 --> 26:40.767
>> SERGIO: That's it. Yeah.

26:40.767 --> 26:41.668
>> CAITLYN: That's all, that's

26:41.668 --> 26:42.669
all that matters.

26:42.669 --> 26:43.736
I'm moving on.

26:43.736 --> 26:44.871
>> SERGIO: Okay, Caitlyn.

26:44.871 --> 26:45.872
>> CAITLYN: Till then, buddy.

26:45.872 --> 26:49.275
Good seeing you.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.509
>> PRODUCER: Have you ever met a

26:50.509 --> 26:52.111
transgender woman or man before?

26:52.111 --> 26:53.145
>> SERGIO: No. No.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.014
>> PRODUCER: So how did it go?

26:55.014 --> 26:56.949
>> SERGIO: It's kind of awkward

26:56.949 --> 27:00.252
but we got, we got used to it.

27:00.252 --> 27:02.554
Whatever makes him happy.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.190
Or her, now.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.191
>> CAITLYN: You know,

27:05.191 --> 27:06.092
everybody's a little nervous.

27:06.092 --> 27:06.893
They meet you and they find out

27:06.893 --> 27:07.894
you're the same person, just you

27:07.894 --> 27:08.895
look different.

27:08.895 --> 27:09.896
He had to get that first one

27:09.896 --> 27:11.330
over with, and I got it over

27:11.330 --> 27:12.331
with.

27:12.331 --> 27:13.499
One more down.

27:13.499 --> 27:17.036
All my buddies.

27:17.036 --> 27:21.507
It's all good.

27:21.507 --> 27:24.977
(birds singing)

27:24.977 --> 27:26.578
Hello.

27:26.578 --> 27:28.447
How you doing?

27:28.447 --> 27:29.448
Caitlyn. Nice to meet you.

27:29.448 --> 27:30.449
>> MILES: Wonderful.

27:30.449 --> 27:31.150
>> CAITLYN: Candis. Chandi.

27:31.150 --> 27:31.984
>> CHANDI: Hi. Nice to meet you.

27:31.984 --> 27:32.719
>> MILES: Hi, how are you?

27:32.719 --> 27:33.853
I'm Miles from Wheels Up.

27:33.853 --> 27:34.821
Have a wonderful trip.

27:34.821 --> 27:35.621
>> CHANDI: Thank you.

27:35.621 --> 27:37.023
>> CAITLYN: We need a picture.

27:37.023 --> 27:37.990
>> MILES: Perfect.

27:37.990 --> 27:38.758
>> CAITLYN: Got it.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.226
Off to New York!

27:40.226 --> 27:43.395
*

27:43.395 --> 27:44.396
>> CHANDI: I've never been on a

27:44.396 --> 27:45.297
private jet.

27:45.297 --> 27:46.098
>> CAITLYN: Okay, hey, now we'll

27:46.098 --> 27:47.033
see how you do here.

27:47.033 --> 27:47.800
>> CHANDI: Okay.

27:47.800 --> 27:48.500
>> CANDIS: Have a good flight,

27:48.500 --> 27:49.368
ladies and gentlemen.

27:49.368 --> 27:50.036
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

27:50.036 --> 27:50.737
Look out the window.

27:50.737 --> 27:51.738
We are climbing up and we are

27:51.738 --> 27:53.039
out of L.A.

27:53.039 --> 27:55.842
*

27:55.842 --> 27:56.843
>> CANDIS: You guys.

27:56.843 --> 27:57.844
How cool is that?

27:57.844 --> 27:58.577
>> CHANDI: Way to go.

27:58.577 --> 27:59.578
It's amazing.

27:59.578 --> 28:00.479
>> CANDIS: When I saw that, I

28:00.479 --> 28:01.547
was like, what a gorgeous

28:01.547 --> 28:02.648
picture.

28:02.648 --> 28:04.050
>> CHANDI: So exciting.

28:04.050 --> 28:04.784
>> CANDIS: That's so good!

28:04.784 --> 28:05.651
>> CHANDI: You're ready, you're

28:05.651 --> 28:06.318
ready, you're ready.

28:06.318 --> 28:07.286
>> CANDIS: You have to know

28:07.286 --> 28:08.888
that, because you're new to this

28:08.888 --> 28:11.257
and this is a whole new chapter,

28:11.257 --> 28:12.558
we're here for you.

28:12.558 --> 28:13.325
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I know.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.126
I know that.

28:14.126 --> 28:14.827
No, I know that very well.

28:14.827 --> 28:15.594
>> CANDIS: Because we've been

28:15.594 --> 28:16.295
experienced this for a

28:16.295 --> 28:16.829
long time.

28:16.829 --> 28:17.663
>> CAITLYN: See, I've always

28:17.663 --> 28:18.430
had a tendency to be a little

28:18.430 --> 28:19.365
bit of a loner.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.266
>> CANDIS: Which makes sense.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.000
>> CAITLYN: You deal with this

28:21.000 --> 28:21.934
issue, can't tell anybody...

28:21.934 --> 28:22.769
>> CHANDI: Right.

28:22.769 --> 28:23.435
>> CAITLYN: ...you become a

28:23.435 --> 28:24.136
loner.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.037
I mean, I would play golf...

28:25.037 --> 28:26.873
95% of the time, play by myself.

28:26.873 --> 28:28.574
Just, I never felt like one of

28:28.574 --> 28:30.309
the guys and I never felt like

28:30.309 --> 28:31.510
one of the girls.

28:31.510 --> 28:32.444
But I've always kind of been

28:32.444 --> 28:33.445
that way.

28:33.445 --> 28:35.581
And I always have survived on my

28:35.581 --> 28:37.383
own just fine.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.785
But it's much better to go

28:38.785 --> 28:39.986
through life with friends.

28:39.986 --> 28:41.120
>> CHANDI: Right.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.089
*

28:48.394 --> 28:49.328
>> CAITLYN: All right, just

28:49.328 --> 28:50.329
remember, girls.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.798
When it comes to these things,

28:51.798 --> 28:52.799
I'm a virgin.

28:52.799 --> 28:53.465
>> CANDIS: I know.

28:53.465 --> 28:53.966
>> CHANDI: Oh!

28:53.966 --> 28:54.801
>> CAITLYN: Yes, I'm a virgin.

28:54.801 --> 28:55.501
You're gonna have to take it

28:55.501 --> 28:56.002
slow.

28:56.002 --> 28:56.668
>> CHANDI: Take it slow.

28:56.668 --> 28:57.469
>> CAITLYN: You're gonna have to

28:57.469 --> 28:58.670
do a lot of explaining.

28:58.670 --> 28:59.671
>> CHANDI: But I'm a virgin to

28:59.671 --> 29:00.907
the NYC Pride.

29:00.907 --> 29:01.607
>> CANDIS: Yes.

29:01.607 --> 29:02.474
>> CAITLYN: We're both virgins?

29:02.474 --> 29:03.309
>> CHANDI: We're both virgins.

29:03.309 --> 29:04.176
>> CANDIS: It's been many years

29:04.176 --> 29:06.145
since I was...

29:06.145 --> 29:07.446
>> CAITLYN: Okay, guys.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.048
This is it. The disco.

29:09.048 --> 29:11.150
>> CHANDI: All right!

29:11.150 --> 29:11.984
>> CANDIS: This is the party

29:11.984 --> 29:12.885
room.

29:12.885 --> 29:13.685
>> CAITLYN: Oh!

29:13.685 --> 29:14.420
Even better yet, we've got

29:14.420 --> 29:15.321
cookies.

29:15.321 --> 29:16.222
(Candis laughs)

29:16.222 --> 29:17.089
>> CANDIS: I'll skip the

29:17.089 --> 29:18.390
cookies, I'll go to the bar.

29:18.390 --> 29:19.225
(laughs)

29:19.225 --> 29:20.526
>> CHANDI: I'll join you.

29:20.526 --> 29:21.427
>> CAITLYN: I'm going with the

29:21.427 --> 29:22.361
cookies.

29:22.361 --> 29:23.729
>> CHANDI: Cait, I'm being nosy.

29:23.729 --> 29:24.864
Ooh, wow.

29:24.864 --> 29:25.531
>> CANDIS: Back here?

29:25.531 --> 29:26.999
Chandi? Chandi, girl.

29:26.999 --> 29:28.267
Look at this.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.268
>> CHANDI: Ooh.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.937
>> CANDIS: This is gorgeous.

29:30.937 --> 29:31.971
>> CHANDI: It's gorgeous.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.239
>> CAITLYN: Look at this

29:33.239 --> 29:34.240
bathroom.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.174
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God, that

29:35.174 --> 29:36.208
shower.

29:36.208 --> 29:40.046
(Caitlyn laughs)

29:40.046 --> 29:41.848
(Chandi laughs)

29:41.848 --> 29:42.614
>> CAITLYN: Perfect!

29:42.614 --> 29:43.482
>> CHANDI: Perfect!

29:43.482 --> 29:44.516
>> CAITLYN: Yay!

29:44.516 --> 29:45.952
>> CHANDI: Brava.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.286
>> CAITLYN: To New York.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.855
>> CANDIS: To an amazing trip.

29:48.855 --> 29:50.189
>> CAITLYN: And here we are.

29:50.189 --> 29:51.223
>> CHANDI: It's marriage

29:51.223 --> 29:51.891
equality.

29:51.891 --> 29:52.591
>> CAITLYN: I love it.

29:52.591 --> 29:53.425
>> CHANDI: Cait, you're here.

29:53.425 --> 29:54.126
>> CAITLYN: First time.

29:54.126 --> 29:54.927
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God, Cait is

29:54.927 --> 29:56.062
coming to my show.

29:56.062 --> 29:56.963
>> CHANDI: Let's toast to that.

29:56.963 --> 29:57.763
>> CAITLYN: I'll drink to that.

29:57.763 --> 29:58.564
>> CANDIS: Yes.

29:58.564 --> 29:59.398
>> CAITLYN: I'll drink to that.

29:59.398 --> 30:00.232
You know what's next on the

30:00.232 --> 30:00.900
schedule?

30:00.900 --> 30:01.567
>> CANDIS: What?

30:01.567 --> 30:02.368
>> CAITLYN: Sleep.

30:02.368 --> 30:03.435
Not that I'm kicking you out.

30:03.435 --> 30:04.436
You can stay here; there's

30:04.436 --> 30:05.271
another bottle in there you can

30:05.271 --> 30:06.038
finish off.

30:06.038 --> 30:06.705
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

30:06.705 --> 30:07.439
>> CANDIS: Oh, no, we'll be

30:07.439 --> 30:08.140
bringing...

30:08.140 --> 30:08.908
>> CAITLYN: It's been a long

30:08.908 --> 30:09.708
day; I'm getting some sleep.

30:09.708 --> 30:10.542
It'll be a long day tomorrow.

30:10.542 --> 30:11.343
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.111
Good night.

30:12.111 --> 30:12.778
>> CAITLYN: See you in the

30:12.778 --> 30:14.746
morning.

30:19.886 --> 30:21.187
>> CANDIS: As much as I was a

30:21.187 --> 30:22.922
part of the community and I was,

30:22.922 --> 30:25.491
you know, praised for my work

30:25.491 --> 30:27.126
and I have a lot of, like, gay

30:27.126 --> 30:29.195
friends and, you know, people in

30:29.195 --> 30:30.296
the community that look up to

30:30.296 --> 30:32.031
me, there's always been

30:32.031 --> 30:33.565
something missing.

30:33.565 --> 30:34.566
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

30:34.566 --> 30:35.767
>> CANDIS: On a larger scale.

30:35.767 --> 30:36.668
>> CHANDI: Right.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.336
>> CANDIS: You know, our

30:37.336 --> 30:38.237
community's always kind of

30:38.237 --> 30:40.206
been... at the bottom of the

30:40.206 --> 30:41.240
totem pole.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.374
>> CHANDI: And it's not like

30:42.374 --> 30:43.709
we've ever looked for the gay

30:43.709 --> 30:46.012
men to-to give us our rah-rahs,

30:46.012 --> 30:47.179
because we have to give them to

30:47.179 --> 30:48.014
ourselves.

30:48.014 --> 30:48.680
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.448
>> CHANDI: We've always had to

30:49.448 --> 30:50.249
do that.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.351
But hopefully, the "T" will be

30:52.351 --> 30:54.653
able to be embraced in the way

30:54.653 --> 30:56.088
that we always should have been.

30:56.088 --> 30:56.923
>> CANDIS: Right.

30:56.923 --> 30:58.390
No, that's true.

30:58.390 --> 30:59.458
>> CHANDI: I don't think Cait

30:59.458 --> 31:02.761
has a clue that there is so much

31:02.761 --> 31:06.132
separation within our LGBT

31:06.132 --> 31:07.934
community.

31:07.934 --> 31:10.069
The history with gay boys is

31:10.069 --> 31:12.271
they've never been able to see

31:12.271 --> 31:14.941
trans women as someone who is a

31:14.941 --> 31:16.708
human being.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.211
Being able to respect us for the

31:19.211 --> 31:21.647
walk that we live each day has

31:21.647 --> 31:22.648
been a problem.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.250
There's segregation right within

31:24.250 --> 31:25.317
our own community.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.019
It's crazy, because we don't

31:27.019 --> 31:28.955
want Cait to feel that pressure,

31:28.955 --> 31:30.689
of feeling like she's carrying

31:30.689 --> 31:31.958
the load for the community.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.325
>> CANDIS: Right. No, for sure.

31:33.325 --> 31:35.327
And-and our community is

31:35.327 --> 31:36.996
desperate for help.

31:36.996 --> 31:39.798
>> CHANDI: Yes.

31:39.798 --> 31:40.499
>> CANDIS: This is the haven.

31:40.499 --> 31:41.167
For all us girls.

31:41.167 --> 31:41.867
>> PATRICIA: This is the

31:41.867 --> 31:42.768
breeding ground.

31:42.768 --> 31:43.835
(laughter)

31:43.835 --> 31:45.737
>> CHANDI: Right, right, right,

31:45.737 --> 31:46.805
right.

31:46.805 --> 31:48.040
(Candis laughs)

31:48.040 --> 31:48.774
>> CAITLYN: Get ready for

31:48.774 --> 31:49.441
Kendall's runway.

31:49.441 --> 31:50.109
>> CHANDI: Right.

31:50.109 --> 31:50.876
>> CAITLYN: You know, just...

31:50.876 --> 31:51.643
cool me down.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.112
>> CHANDI: Cool you down.

31:53.112 --> 31:54.880
(crowd cheering)

31:54.880 --> 31:56.448
>> FAN: Caitlyn! Caitlyn!

31:56.448 --> 31:57.883
>> CAITLYN: I have always

31:57.883 --> 31:59.685
worried about what that first

31:59.685 --> 32:02.588
experience would be like.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.991
How people would react to me.

32:04.991 --> 32:06.658
And here I am, going to a very

32:06.658 --> 32:08.627
public outing.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.000
>> CANDIS: So I just wanted to

32:14.000 --> 32:16.002
take you to Patricia Field's,

32:16.002 --> 32:18.637
because she is a designer and

32:18.637 --> 32:20.672
from the '80s, she had stores

32:20.672 --> 32:22.208
in-in the city and it was kind

32:22.208 --> 32:23.709
of the only place that anybody

32:23.709 --> 32:25.444
who was different could go and

32:25.444 --> 32:27.446
get clothing, bigger shoes,

32:27.446 --> 32:28.580
bras, corsets...

32:28.580 --> 32:29.248
>> CAITLYN: Really?

32:29.248 --> 32:30.082
>> CANDIS: ...and it was all

32:30.082 --> 32:30.882
the, all the people from the

32:30.882 --> 32:32.184
clubs, all the cross-dressers,

32:32.184 --> 32:33.785
all the trans people.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.154
They would go to Patricia Field,

32:35.154 --> 32:36.022
'cause that was the only place

32:36.022 --> 32:37.023
you could go.

32:37.023 --> 32:38.657
And she would open her arms and,

32:38.657 --> 32:40.026
you know... we would all work at

32:40.026 --> 32:41.327
her store.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.028
>> CAITLYN: And you worked

32:42.028 --> 32:42.661
there?

32:42.661 --> 32:43.495
>> CANDIS: I worked there, yeah.

32:43.495 --> 32:44.396
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God.

32:44.396 --> 32:45.097
>> CHANDI: She also did the

32:45.097 --> 32:45.931
styling for Sex and the City,

32:45.931 --> 32:46.698
right?

32:46.698 --> 32:47.499
>> CANDIS: Styled Sex and the

32:47.499 --> 32:48.234
City.

32:48.234 --> 32:49.035
>> CAITLYN: Oh, no way!

32:49.035 --> 32:49.735
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

32:49.735 --> 32:50.502
>> CAITLYN: Oh, that's big.

32:50.502 --> 32:51.437
>> CANDIS: Yeah, she was the...

32:51.437 --> 32:52.304
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, 'cause that

32:52.304 --> 32:53.072
show was just known for...

32:53.072 --> 32:54.040
>> CANDIS: For its fashion.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.041
>> CHANDI: For fashion.

32:55.041 --> 32:55.707
>> CAITLYN: For style and stuff.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.043
Wow. How exciting.

32:57.043 --> 32:58.110
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.545
>> CAITLYN: May be a little over

32:59.545 --> 33:00.379
the top for me.

33:00.379 --> 33:01.213
(Chandi laughs)

33:01.213 --> 33:03.249
I don't know.

33:06.052 --> 33:06.952
>> REPORTER: Caitlyn!

33:06.952 --> 33:07.853
Just look here!

33:07.853 --> 33:09.055
(reporters clamoring)

33:09.055 --> 33:09.721
>> MAN: Keep doing your thing,

33:09.721 --> 33:10.689
Caitlyn!

33:10.689 --> 33:11.490
>> PATRICIA: Hi, gals.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.224
>> CANDIS: Chandi, Caitlyn, this

33:12.224 --> 33:13.225
is Patricia Field.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.060
>> PATRICIA: How do you do?

33:14.060 --> 33:15.194
How do you do? Welcome.

33:15.194 --> 33:16.062
>> CAITLYN: Nice to meet you.

33:16.062 --> 33:16.795
Thank you.

33:16.795 --> 33:17.496
>> PATRICIA: You got somebody

33:17.496 --> 33:18.164
great here.

33:18.164 --> 33:18.864
>> CAITLYN: Oh... Can you

33:18.864 --> 33:20.166
believe that Candis worked here

33:20.166 --> 33:20.932
many years ago?

33:20.932 --> 33:22.068
>> PATRICIA: Of course.

33:22.068 --> 33:23.135
>> CAITLYN: She's... yeah.

33:23.135 --> 33:23.835
>> CANDIS: This is the haven.

33:23.835 --> 33:24.636
For all of us girls.

33:24.636 --> 33:25.304
>> PATRICIA: This is the

33:25.304 --> 33:25.971
breeding ground.

33:25.971 --> 33:27.073
(laughter)

33:27.073 --> 33:28.274
>> CHANDI: I love it.

33:28.274 --> 33:28.974
>> CANDIS: It is the breeding

33:28.974 --> 33:29.675
ground...

33:29.675 --> 33:30.342
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.077
>> CANDIS: ...for all the girls

33:31.077 --> 33:31.743
to just be themselves.

33:31.743 --> 33:32.544
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. How great.

33:32.544 --> 33:33.612
Well, let's check it out.

33:33.612 --> 33:34.380
>> PATRICIA: Good.

33:34.380 --> 33:38.317
(laughs)

33:38.317 --> 33:39.318
>> CAITLYN: Look at that.

33:39.318 --> 33:42.288
I actually love that.

33:42.288 --> 33:43.889
>> CANDIS: This is cute, right?

33:43.889 --> 33:45.657
>> CHANDI: Right, right, right,

33:45.657 --> 33:46.725
right.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.427
(laughter)

33:48.427 --> 33:49.795
>> CANDIS: I love it.

33:49.795 --> 33:50.729
>> CHANDI: I'm thinkin' that's

33:50.729 --> 33:51.530
kind of hot.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.798
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

33:52.798 --> 33:55.734
>> CHANDI: Oh, wow.

33:55.734 --> 33:56.735
Ooh!

33:56.735 --> 33:57.803
>> CANDIS: Oh, yeah!

33:57.803 --> 33:58.837
>> PATRICIA: Ta-da!

33:58.837 --> 34:01.273
>> CHANDI: Ooh. Right.

34:01.273 --> 34:02.508
>> CANDIS: I love that.

34:02.508 --> 34:03.309
>> PATRICIA: Love that.

34:03.309 --> 34:04.310
I think it's so important

34:04.310 --> 34:06.878
to, you know, catch...

34:06.878 --> 34:09.615
her essence and then develop it

34:09.615 --> 34:10.882
in our way.

34:10.882 --> 34:11.683
>> CAITLYN: You know, we just

34:11.683 --> 34:12.584
kind of work it, Chandi.

34:12.584 --> 34:13.885
>> CHANDI: Oh.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.154
>> PATRICIA: I try to get to

34:15.154 --> 34:17.456
understand her taste, her soul,

34:17.456 --> 34:19.291
her heart... so she has to feel

34:19.291 --> 34:20.392
comfortable.

34:20.392 --> 34:21.760
Otherwise, the clothes are

34:21.760 --> 34:23.129
wearing her, and we don't want

34:23.129 --> 34:25.131
that.

34:25.131 --> 34:26.198
Yeah.

34:26.198 --> 34:27.133
>> CAITLYN: Get ready

34:27.133 --> 34:28.167
for Kendall's runway.

34:28.167 --> 34:28.834
>> CHANDI: Right.

34:28.834 --> 34:29.601
>> CAITLYN: You know?

34:29.601 --> 34:30.469
Just... cool me down.

34:30.469 --> 34:31.470
>> CHANDI: Cool you down.

34:31.470 --> 34:32.404
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, just cool me

34:32.404 --> 34:33.139
down.

34:33.139 --> 34:33.839
>> PATRICIA: I can tell she's

34:33.839 --> 34:34.540
feeling it.

34:34.540 --> 34:35.407
(laughter)

34:35.407 --> 34:36.175
Oh...

34:36.175 --> 34:36.842
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

34:36.842 --> 34:37.343
Thank you.

34:37.343 --> 34:38.009
>> PATRICIA: Oh, it was great.

34:38.009 --> 34:38.744
>> CAITLYN: ...for being so nice

34:38.744 --> 34:39.411
and having fun with this.

34:39.411 --> 34:40.179
>> PATRICIA: It was great.

34:40.179 --> 34:41.447
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

34:41.447 --> 34:42.748
What an amazing experience, to

34:42.748 --> 34:43.849
meet and spend some time with

34:43.849 --> 34:44.916
Patricia.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.985
I mean, over the years, she has

34:46.985 --> 34:48.654
been very supportive and

34:48.654 --> 34:50.822
committed to making a difference

34:50.822 --> 34:53.024
for the transgender community.

34:53.024 --> 34:55.327
That, to me, is like... amazing.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.296
*

34:59.565 --> 35:00.232
>> CANDIS: Do you want some

35:00.232 --> 35:00.899
coffee or anything?

35:00.899 --> 35:01.567
>> CHANDI: I would love some

35:01.567 --> 35:02.634
coffee.

35:02.634 --> 35:03.735
Great.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.171
>> CANDIS: One of, like, the

35:05.171 --> 35:07.173
trans pioneers is really sick

35:07.173 --> 35:08.207
right now.

35:08.207 --> 35:09.641
In the hospital, in Cedars.

35:09.641 --> 35:10.942
Her name's Holly Woodlawn.

35:10.942 --> 35:11.843
Do you know Holly?

35:11.843 --> 35:12.678
>> CAITLYN: No.

35:12.678 --> 35:13.679
>> CANDIS: She was one of the

35:13.679 --> 35:14.780
original, like, Andy Warhol

35:14.780 --> 35:16.014
girls.

35:16.014 --> 35:17.349
She's not doing very well right

35:17.349 --> 35:19.351
now.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.019
She was kind of trans before you

35:21.019 --> 35:22.020
could...

35:22.020 --> 35:23.021
>> CAITLYN: Right.

35:23.021 --> 35:24.022
>> CANDIS: ...you know, be

35:24.022 --> 35:25.691
trans and, you know, get killed

35:25.691 --> 35:27.025
in the home life.

35:27.025 --> 35:28.026
>> CAITLYN: So this is in what

35:28.026 --> 35:29.027
years?

35:29.027 --> 35:30.028
'60s, '70s?

35:30.028 --> 35:31.029
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

35:31.029 --> 35:32.030
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

35:32.030 --> 35:33.031
>> CANDIS: I think about the

35:33.031 --> 35:34.032
'60s.

35:34.032 --> 35:35.033
>> CAITLYN: You know, Holly's

35:35.033 --> 35:36.368
story really touched me.

35:36.368 --> 35:37.703
I'm sitting there getting tears

35:37.703 --> 35:41.373
into my eyes, thinking how

35:41.373 --> 35:43.709
difficult life has been for her.

35:43.709 --> 35:46.044
And it just reminds me of just

35:46.044 --> 35:48.046
how much of a short time we all

35:48.046 --> 35:50.048
have to really make a

35:50.048 --> 35:51.049
difference.

35:51.049 --> 35:52.050
>> CANDIS: I just want to send

35:52.050 --> 35:53.051
a little prayer out to Holly.

35:53.051 --> 35:54.052
And-and, you know...

35:54.052 --> 35:55.053
>> CHANDI: We definitely need to

35:55.053 --> 35:56.054
say a little prayer for Holly.

35:56.054 --> 35:57.055
Send up some prayers.

35:57.055 --> 35:59.024
>> CANDIS: Send up some prayers.

36:07.266 --> 36:08.099
>> CAITLYN: They're ready for

36:08.099 --> 36:08.700
us?

36:08.700 --> 36:09.601
>> CHANDI: They're ready for us.

36:09.601 --> 36:11.937
>> CAITLYN: I say we go do it.

36:11.937 --> 36:13.605
I thought all my life about

36:13.605 --> 36:16.275
going public.

36:16.275 --> 36:17.609
You know, I've snuck around when

36:17.609 --> 36:19.611
nobody's known who I was or

36:19.611 --> 36:20.946
anything.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.948
I have always worried about what

36:22.948 --> 36:24.950
that first experience would be

36:24.950 --> 36:27.619
like, how people would react to

36:27.619 --> 36:28.620
me.

36:28.620 --> 36:31.290
And here I am... going to a very

36:31.290 --> 36:33.259
public outing.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.566
That acceptance in the public

36:40.566 --> 36:42.268
where I really don't know what's

36:42.268 --> 36:44.270
going to happen there.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.545
I'm hoping for the best, but you

36:53.545 --> 36:55.514
just don't know.

37:05.691 --> 37:08.660
(crowd cheers, whoops)

37:11.463 --> 37:12.831
>> CROWD (chanting): Caitlyn,

37:12.831 --> 37:14.966
Caitlyn, Caitlyn, Caitlyn,

37:14.966 --> 37:17.135
Caitlyn, Caitlyn...!

37:17.135 --> 37:19.104
(crowd cheering)

37:24.810 --> 37:26.478
>> CHANDI: Doesn't that feel

37:26.478 --> 37:27.479
good?

37:27.479 --> 37:29.481
Feels good, doesn't it, girl?

37:29.481 --> 37:30.482
Yes!

37:30.482 --> 37:32.150
>> CAITLYN: I am so blessed to

37:32.150 --> 37:34.152
be able to get the reaction that

37:34.152 --> 37:35.153
I have gotten.

37:35.153 --> 37:38.824
It has been overwhelmingly good.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.826
You have no idea how freeing it

37:40.826 --> 37:41.827
is.

37:41.827 --> 37:43.161
>> EMCEE: Ladies and gentlemen,

37:43.161 --> 37:44.830
welcome to the stage Candis

37:44.830 --> 37:46.164
Cayne!

37:46.164 --> 37:48.133
(crowd applauds, whoops)

37:51.236 --> 37:54.205
(up-tempo jazz music plays)

38:04.350 --> 38:05.651
>> CAITLYN: One thing I really

38:05.651 --> 38:07.353
do admire about Candis is she

38:07.353 --> 38:08.987
has really embraced her

38:08.987 --> 38:10.989
femininity.

38:10.989 --> 38:13.959
(crowd whoops, whistles)

38:18.664 --> 38:20.666
And her show is, like, over the

38:20.666 --> 38:23.369
top, a lot of fun, and it's, for

38:23.369 --> 38:25.003
me, in a lot of ways, you know,

38:25.003 --> 38:28.006
it inspires me, that I can have

38:28.006 --> 38:30.008
that inner beauty come out in

38:30.008 --> 38:32.077
me.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.078
(crowd whoops)

38:33.078 --> 38:34.546
>> MAN: New York loves you,

38:34.546 --> 38:35.414
Candis!

38:35.414 --> 38:36.748
(Candis sighs)

38:36.748 --> 38:38.750
(crowd whoops)

38:38.750 --> 38:40.752
>> CANDIS: Thank you.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.754
It's so good to be home.

38:42.754 --> 38:45.090
What a good, amazing Gay Pride

38:45.090 --> 38:46.425
to be at, I mean...

38:46.425 --> 38:49.428
(crowd whoops)

38:49.428 --> 38:50.762
And let me just give a shout-out

38:50.762 --> 38:52.097
to my mom and dad who are here

38:52.097 --> 38:53.432
today.

38:53.432 --> 38:56.435
(applause, whoops)

38:56.435 --> 38:57.436
I love you guys.

38:57.436 --> 38:58.770
Thank you so much.

38:58.770 --> 39:00.439
I've had the most amazing few

39:00.439 --> 39:01.440
days.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.174
And, you know, a lot of that has

39:03.174 --> 39:05.176
to do with somebody that I met

39:05.176 --> 39:07.846
recently and that I've got to

39:07.846 --> 39:10.849
know and really got to love.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.518
And I'm so honored and happy

39:12.518 --> 39:14.185
that she's here today.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.854
Caitlyn Jenner, we love you.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.823
(crowd cheering, whooping)

39:23.194 --> 39:24.062
Honey...

39:24.062 --> 39:24.996
>> CROWD (chanting): Caitlyn,

39:24.996 --> 39:27.599
Caitlyn, Caitlyn, Caitlyn,

39:27.599 --> 39:31.202
Caitlyn, Caitlyn, Caitlyn...!

39:31.202 --> 39:32.538
>> CAITLYN: So much fun.

39:32.538 --> 39:34.540
>> CANDIS: Thank you for coming.

39:34.540 --> 39:37.208
I think that Cait was probably a

39:37.208 --> 39:39.210
little nervous about going to

39:39.210 --> 39:40.879
New York City and be a part of

39:40.879 --> 39:42.548
Gay Pride, which she doesn't

39:42.548 --> 39:44.215
really... she hasn't really felt

39:44.215 --> 39:46.217
a part of ever in her life.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.220
But the response from the

39:49.220 --> 39:52.891
community was so immense, and I

39:52.891 --> 39:54.893
think that was proof to her that

39:54.893 --> 39:57.228
she had a family in our

39:57.228 --> 39:59.565
community, which was really

39:59.565 --> 40:00.899
important.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.568
>> CHANDI: I am so impressed...

40:02.568 --> 40:03.902
>> CAITLYN: Impressed?

40:03.902 --> 40:05.571
>> CHANDI: ...with the LGB...

40:05.571 --> 40:06.572
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I know.

40:06.572 --> 40:07.906
>> CHANDI: ...embracing your T,

40:07.906 --> 40:08.907
like mine.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.241
(everyone laughs, groans)

40:10.241 --> 40:11.910
That just meant the world to me.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.244
It almost brought tears to my

40:13.244 --> 40:14.580
eyes to hear them chanting

40:14.580 --> 40:15.581
"Caitlyn."

40:15.581 --> 40:16.582
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I know, it was

40:16.582 --> 40:17.583
cute. Very cute.

40:17.583 --> 40:18.584
>> CHANDI: Oh, my goodness.

40:18.584 --> 40:19.585
See what I mean?

40:19.585 --> 40:20.586
This is the type of impact...

40:20.586 --> 40:21.587
>> COURTNEY: Not... not "cute,"

40:21.587 --> 40:22.588
that was a moment.

40:22.588 --> 40:23.589
>> CHANDI: ...that you are

40:23.589 --> 40:24.590
making on the community.

40:24.590 --> 40:25.591
And it's not about you even

40:25.591 --> 40:27.593
doing or saying a thing.

40:27.593 --> 40:28.594
You haven't said a word.

40:28.594 --> 40:29.595
>> COURTNEY: No, you were just

40:29.595 --> 40:30.261
there.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.262
>> CHANDI: But look how they

40:31.262 --> 40:32.263
love you.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.264
That's what we need.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.266
Just to be in that room just

40:35.266 --> 40:36.602
felt so electric.

40:36.602 --> 40:38.604
Just to feel all the love that

40:38.604 --> 40:40.606
was going on was amazing.

40:40.606 --> 40:41.607
I wouldn't trade it for the

40:41.607 --> 40:42.608
world.

40:42.608 --> 40:43.609
>> KATE: That hasn't happened.

40:43.609 --> 40:44.610
>> CAITLYN: No way.

40:44.610 --> 40:45.611
>> KATE: That's a big deal.

40:45.611 --> 40:47.278
You're opening doors for a lot

40:47.278 --> 40:48.614
of us.

40:48.614 --> 40:49.615
Thank you.

40:49.615 --> 40:50.616
>> CAITLYN: That's good.

40:50.616 --> 40:51.617
>> BARBARA: Yeah, you are.

40:51.617 --> 40:52.618
>> CAITLYN: You've been doing

40:52.618 --> 40:53.619
this a long time.

40:53.619 --> 40:54.953
It's been a long struggle, you

40:54.953 --> 40:55.954
know?

40:55.954 --> 40:56.955
And I'm glad we're moving

40:56.955 --> 40:57.956
forward.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.958
I'm glad I can be a part of it.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.292
>> KATE: Less of a struggle,

41:01.292 --> 41:03.028
more of a giggle.

41:03.028 --> 41:04.295
>> BARBARA: Yes. Yes. Yes.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.631
>> CAITLYN: I'm in! (chuckles)

41:05.631 --> 41:07.933
I am so into that. Yes.

41:15.006 --> 41:16.007
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God, that was

41:16.007 --> 41:17.008
so good.

41:17.008 --> 41:18.677
I can't wait to go backstage.

41:18.677 --> 41:20.679
I'm on Broadway!

41:20.679 --> 41:23.348
I'm finally on Broadway!

41:23.348 --> 41:24.683
Goddamn it!

41:24.683 --> 41:27.352
>> JR JR: * I can't be...

41:27.352 --> 41:31.356
Everything you want me to be

41:31.356 --> 41:35.360
I can't be... everything... *

41:35.360 --> 41:36.361
>> CAITLYN: Over the last couple

41:36.361 --> 41:38.363
of years, I've really isolated

41:38.363 --> 41:40.365
myself from the world, uh,

41:40.365 --> 41:42.701
especially the last five months

41:42.701 --> 41:44.703
leading up to the Vanity Fair

41:44.703 --> 41:46.037
article.

41:46.037 --> 41:49.040
Uh, the vibe in New York is so

41:49.040 --> 41:51.042
different than what I'm used to.

41:51.042 --> 41:53.378
Everybody seems to be so

41:53.378 --> 41:56.715
excited, one, that I'm there,

41:56.715 --> 42:01.386
and so enthusiastic that it's

42:01.386 --> 42:04.455
kind of overwhelming.

42:04.455 --> 42:06.124
I'm not used to that.

42:06.124 --> 42:08.126
Even in the old days.

42:08.126 --> 42:10.128
This is a bigger response.

42:10.128 --> 42:11.129
>> CANDIS: I'll buffer it for

42:11.129 --> 42:12.130
you.

42:12.130 --> 42:13.131
>> CAITLYN: Go.

42:13.131 --> 42:14.800
>> JR JR: * Over and over...

42:14.800 --> 42:15.801
>> CAITLYN: Let's do it.

42:15.801 --> 42:18.469
>> JR JR: * I can't be...

42:18.469 --> 42:19.437
>> CAITLYN: All right, here

42:19.437 --> 42:20.138
we go.

42:20.138 --> 42:20.806
>> JR JR: * Everything you want

42:20.806 --> 42:23.141
me to be

42:23.141 --> 42:26.144
* I can't be...

42:26.144 --> 42:30.481
Everything you want me to be

42:30.481 --> 42:34.152
* Finally...

42:34.152 --> 42:35.821
I can see the light

42:35.821 --> 42:38.489
Through the leaves... *

42:38.489 --> 42:39.825
>> CAITLYN: It has been an

42:39.825 --> 42:42.160
amazing journey for me.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.162
And I'm seeing all of it come

42:44.162 --> 42:45.831
true.

42:45.831 --> 42:47.833
>> JR JR: * But it's all gone.

42:47.833 --> 42:49.801
>> CANDIS: Wow, what a crowd.

43:00.345 --> 43:01.346
(playful shouting)

43:01.346 --> 43:02.347
>> CHILD: We want to welcome

43:02.347 --> 43:03.749
everyone to camp.

43:03.749 --> 43:04.750
>> CHILD 2: Being around friends

43:04.750 --> 43:07.418
is really nice when you haven't

43:07.418 --> 43:09.087
been around friends for most of

43:09.087 --> 43:10.088
your life.

43:10.088 --> 43:11.089
>> CAITLYN: We're all beautiful!

43:11.089 --> 43:12.758
Hey!

43:12.758 --> 43:13.759
>> CANDIS: We could have, like,

43:13.759 --> 43:16.094
a girls' night.

43:16.094 --> 43:17.095
>> JENNY: What I'm afraid of is

43:17.095 --> 43:18.096
that you're afraid to come out

43:18.096 --> 43:19.931
and say, "I love women, and I'm

43:19.931 --> 43:20.932
a lesbian."

43:20.932 --> 43:21.933
>> CAITLYN: Just kind of so

43:21.933 --> 43:22.934
obsessed with educating people.

43:22.934 --> 43:23.935
>> JENNY: But you're not

43:23.935 --> 43:24.936
answering my question.

43:24.936 --> 43:25.671
>> CAITLYN: W-Wait, wait, wait.

43:25.671 --> 43:26.672
>> JENNY: Caitlyn Jenner, you're

43:26.672 --> 43:27.272
running away from it.
