trying to get on with his life.

10:16.591 --> 10:19.794
Well, I just compared photos
from the first and second crime scenes.

10:19.862 --> 10:21.795
The cars used to drag
were different.

10:21.863 --> 10:23.130
Maybe the killer
switched cars?

10:23.197 --> 10:24.831
Or we're looking
at two unsubs.

10:24.899 --> 10:26.199
What did you
and Morgan find?

10:26.267 --> 10:27.768
Well, at both crime scenes,

10:27.835 --> 10:30.871
the nearby stores were either closed
or being remodeled,

10:30.938 --> 10:33.106
so the killer would have
had to scope the area,

10:33.174 --> 10:35.041
lure and drag the victim
without being caught.

10:35.109 --> 10:37.377
This guy has a lot to do.
So the question remains,

10:37.444 --> 10:39.379
how can you do that
twice in one night

10:39.446 --> 10:41.281
in cities over
100 miles apart?

10:41.348 --> 10:43.716
Two unsubs would explain
the evolution in M.O.

10:43.784 --> 10:45.985
What did Rossi and Blake say?

10:46.019 --> 10:47.453
The first victim Brenda
was dragged postmortem.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.755
The second victim
was alive.

10:48.822 --> 10:51.557
So we're most likely looking
at one unsub who's hesitant

10:51.625 --> 10:55.260
and another one
who actually enjoys it.

10:56.329 --> 10:57.962
What do you mean,
you killed her first?

10:58.030 --> 11:00.499
I just couldn't do it
while she was still alive.

11:00.566 --> 11:02.033
But that's the whole point.

11:02.101 --> 11:03.735
Come on,
you know what she did.

11:03.803 --> 11:05.671
I know. But she was
begging for her life

11:05.738 --> 11:07.339
and I just couldn't hear it
anymore.

11:07.407 --> 11:09.240
Oh, you should have
called me.

11:09.309 --> 11:11.475
You had your own thing
to do.

11:11.543 --> 11:15.513
Ok, we've been planning this thing
for 6 months.

11:15.580 --> 11:16.781
If you thought you were
gonna chicken out,

11:16.848 --> 11:19.417
you should have told me
at last week's meeting.

11:19.451 --> 11:22.186
Ok, we're done now,
so let's just go home

11:22.253 --> 11:24.322
and pretend
this never happened.

11:24.389 --> 11:27.490
No. We're not going
anywhere.

11:27.558 --> 11:30.026
When I killed Mark,

11:30.093 --> 11:33.229
he told me there were
two other guys that helped.

11:33.297 --> 11:34.964
What?

11:36.734 --> 11:40.470
He didn't do this alone?

11:43.440 --> 11:45.073
So what are we
gonna do now?

11:45.141 --> 11:46.975
We're gonna kill them.
That is what we're gonna do.

11:47.043 --> 11:48.744
I can't do this again!

11:48.812 --> 11:52.147
Yes. Yes.
Yes, Darlene, you can.

11:52.215 --> 11:54.182
I don't know...

11:54.250 --> 11:59.186
Darlene, if we don't do this,
who else will?

12:02.825 --> 12:05.460
We know most teams work
together, two unsubs versus one victim.

12:05.527 --> 12:08.162
Here we have a team
that's 120 miles apart

12:08.230 --> 12:10.631
using similar M.O.s
on radically different victims.

12:10.699 --> 12:12.967
JJ: Ok, so how
do we think they met?

12:13.034 --> 12:15.369
Blake: Something in the
victimology should tell us.

12:15.436 --> 12:17.203
Morgan: Well, we know that victim
number two, Mark Coleman,

12:17.271 --> 12:19.639
has a sketchy background.
What if victim number one

12:19.707 --> 12:20.940
was hiding something
as well?

12:21.008 --> 12:22.609
Let's start digging.

12:53.472 --> 12:56.073
Who the hell are you?

12:56.141 --> 12:57.909
You thought you could
rape and kill an 8-year-old

12:57.976 --> 12:59.143
and get away with it?

12:59.211 --> 13:00.678
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:00.746 --> 13:03.013
Yeah. That's not
what Mark said!

13:03.080 --> 13:06.016
Ok. Ok. I was there,
but I didn't do anything.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.350
Shut up!

13:07.419 --> 13:08.985
I thought if I tried
to stop them, they'd hurt me.

13:09.053 --> 13:10.821
Imagine how Kelly felt.

13:10.889 --> 13:11.755
What are you doing?

13:11.823 --> 13:13.089
Let's just kill him now.

13:13.157 --> 13:15.358
No, that's too easy.
Now get in the car.

13:15.427 --> 13:17.193
You don't need to do this!

13:17.962 --> 13:20.396
Karma's a bitch, isn't it?

13:20.464 --> 13:22.565
I didn't do anything.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.067
I didn't do anything.

13:25.135 --> 13:26.702
I didn't do anything!

13:26.770 --> 13:28.704
No!

13:28.772 --> 13:29.939
Help!

13:30.006 --> 13:30.873
Come on!

13:30.941 --> 13:33.609
No, no, I didn't do anything!

13:33.677 --> 13:36.344
Help! Please help!

13:36.378 --> 13:39.080
I didn't do anything! Help!

13:47.799 --> 13:48.932
What did you find?

13:49.001 --> 13:51.768
Paul Montgomery was alive
when he was dragged.

13:51.836 --> 13:54.437
And it turns out Paul worked
the late shift nearby.

13:54.505 --> 13:56.473
My officers found blood
around his vehicle.

13:56.540 --> 13:58.608
He was probably blitz
attacked when he left work.

13:58.675 --> 13:59.709
Did we find his cell?

13:59.776 --> 14:00.877
Yeah, it was on the ground.

14:00.944 --> 14:03.179
But he had no text messages
or prior calls.

14:03.247 --> 14:04.414
That's a change in M.O.

14:04.482 --> 14:05.982
Usually they lure
their victims out.

14:06.050 --> 14:08.518
[Cell phone rings] What happened
to their organization?

14:08.585 --> 14:09.719
[Ring]

14:09.786 --> 14:11.686
Garcia, what did you find
out about Paul Montgomery?

14:11.754 --> 14:13.788
So guess who were BFFs
in college.

14:13.856 --> 14:15.457
Hmm. Mark Coleman
and Paul?

14:15.525 --> 14:17.092
10 points to Blakendore.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.827
Turns out Paul
was a character witness

14:18.895 --> 14:20.996
in Mark Coleman's
rape trial.

14:21.064 --> 14:22.898
He waxed poet about his boy.
The jury didn't care.

14:22.965 --> 14:26.034
So we have two scumbags
and an innocent mom as victims.

14:26.101 --> 14:27.735
Anything
in Brenda Wipley's past?

14:27.802 --> 14:30.338
No, not that I've found yet.
She went to college at UCLA,

14:30.406 --> 14:31.439
she went to high school
in Orange County.

14:31.507 --> 14:33.174
Does she have a sealed
juvie record?

14:33.242 --> 14:34.675
Why didn't I think of that?

14:34.743 --> 14:36.010
See, this is why
you're the boss man

14:36.078 --> 14:38.746
and I'm the minion
who types things.

14:38.813 --> 14:41.649
Uh, it turns out Brenda
was not as coifed as her bob.

14:41.716 --> 14:43.683
When she was 17,
she was involved in a DUI

14:43.751 --> 14:46.420
that resulted in the death
of a 2-year-old boy, Sam Dolan.

14:46.487 --> 14:47.687
Did she serve time?

14:47.755 --> 14:50.690
Yeah, she was sentenced
to a year in juvie.

14:50.758 --> 14:52.345
It was reduced to two months

14:52.370 --> 14:54.327
after her father gave
hefty chunks of change

14:54.328 --> 14:55.728
to some political
organizations.

14:55.796 --> 14:57.931
So, we're definitely
looking at a vigilante team

14:57.998 --> 15:00.032
avenging the death
of these two kids.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.000
We should talk to the parents
of the original victims.

15:02.069 --> 15:05.704
I'll bet they're the connection
to these unsubs. Thanks, Garcia.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.910
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Dolan.

15:18.284 --> 15:21.018
That was taken
at his second birthday.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.555
His mom sent one
to everyone.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.223
I know this is hard,

15:25.291 --> 15:27.692
but I need to ask you
some questions

15:27.759 --> 15:30.961
about the death of the woman
who killed your son.

15:31.028 --> 15:32.729
Like I told the cops,

15:32.797 --> 15:34.565
I was returning home
from London

15:34.632 --> 15:36.066
the night Brenda
was murdered.

15:36.134 --> 15:37.801
I have my boarding pass.

15:37.868 --> 15:40.670
Ok. Now, what about your wife?
Where was she?

15:42.307 --> 15:45.209
She killed herself
a few years ago.

15:45.276 --> 15:47.143
Uh...

15:47.211 --> 15:50.246
I am so sorry
to hear that.

15:50.314 --> 15:52.515
She said she was
getting better, and--

15:52.583 --> 15:54.417
but ever since
Sam's death,

15:54.485 --> 15:56.986
she was a mess.

15:57.053 --> 15:58.988
Do you think
the lenient sentence

15:59.055 --> 16:01.190
was a contributing factor
in her death?

16:01.258 --> 16:02.491
Absolutely.

16:02.558 --> 16:05.760
She thought the system
failed us.

16:07.830 --> 16:10.499
She wouldn't leave
the house after that.

16:10.566 --> 16:12.200
She even did therapy
over the phone.

16:12.268 --> 16:13.568
Did she have friends over?

16:13.636 --> 16:14.869
No.

16:14.937 --> 16:16.704
She spent all her time
on the Internet.

16:16.772 --> 16:18.506
Really?

16:18.573 --> 16:21.275
Did she join any online
support groups?

16:21.343 --> 16:23.677
How'd you know?

16:27.149 --> 16:30.117
She said it was
making her better.

16:30.185 --> 16:32.553
But I--I thought
it was making her worse.

16:32.621 --> 16:33.621
Why?

16:33.688 --> 16:36.822
Because it allowed her
to obsess about it.

16:38.992 --> 16:41.861
And look where that got her.

16:48.369 --> 16:50.069
Oh, no.
[Vomiting]

16:50.137 --> 16:51.336
Not again.

16:51.404 --> 16:53.004
I can't do this.

16:53.072 --> 16:56.041
I thought it was gonna help,
but it isn't.

16:56.108 --> 16:58.577
That's because
you're not letting it.

16:58.611 --> 17:00.078
But it's wrong.

17:00.146 --> 17:02.714
An eye for an eye?
It's biblical.

17:02.782 --> 17:05.784
When I wake up
in the morning,

17:05.851 --> 17:08.618
I see Kelly's face.

17:08.688 --> 17:12.423
When I close my eyes,
she's still there.

17:12.491 --> 17:15.425
I don't know how much longer
I can go on like this.

17:15.493 --> 17:17.095
Don't. Don't you say that.

17:17.163 --> 17:18.997
But that's how I feel.

17:19.065 --> 17:21.432
You should feel
rejuvenated.

17:21.500 --> 17:25.468
Come here. Come on.
Come on.

17:27.939 --> 17:29.606
Look.

17:29.674 --> 17:31.208
Look at you.

17:31.275 --> 17:32.710
They did this.

17:32.777 --> 17:34.044
They did this to you.

17:34.112 --> 17:38.182
So don't tell me they don't deserve
what's coming to them.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.351
Order's up.

17:41.419 --> 17:43.386
Thanks.

17:43.454 --> 17:45.154
Just finished my interview.

17:45.223 --> 17:46.889
Sam Dolan's father
checks out.

17:46.957 --> 17:48.692
His mother committed
suicide a few years ago.

17:48.759 --> 17:50.126
What about Kelly's parents?

17:50.194 --> 17:51.994
We've left them
messages, but...

17:52.062 --> 17:53.463
You might send an officer
to their house

17:53.531 --> 17:54.698
and places of employment.

17:54.765 --> 17:56.798
We should also check
at the support group

17:56.866 --> 17:58.467
Sam's mother belonged to.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.269
Morgan:
Well, we got something.

18:00.337 --> 18:02.671
The calls the unsub made to the victims--
twice a day at night.

18:02.739 --> 18:04.273
That shows incredible
persistence.

18:04.341 --> 18:06.375
The first victim, Brenda,
was a happily married teacher,

18:06.443 --> 18:08.777
so why would she take calls
from a random man late at night?

18:08.828 --> 18:09.468
If she was cheating,

18:09.469 --> 18:10.846
she wouldn't meet someone
at a restaurant near her house.

18:10.847 --> 18:12.880
I think she was meeting a woman.

18:12.948 --> 18:14.982
The roommate said the second victim,
Mark, in a sober living house

18:15.050 --> 18:17.017
said that he was talking
to someone online a lot lately.

18:17.085 --> 18:18.341
The night he got killed,

18:18.366 --> 18:20.288
he got dressed up like
he was going out on a date.

18:20.289 --> 18:22.624
And he's straight, which further
confirms it was a female.

18:22.691 --> 18:24.859
That would explain
the blitz attacks.

18:24.926 --> 18:28.061
They weren't because our
unsubs were insecure men,

18:28.129 --> 18:29.529
they were because our unsubs
are women,

18:29.597 --> 18:32.699
who needed to subdue
their victims first.

18:34.034 --> 18:35.769
We need to give the profile.

18:37.405 --> 18:39.172
We believe that these unsubs
are two women

18:39.240 --> 18:41.508
who are killing people
convicted of heinous crimes.

18:41.576 --> 18:44.943
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

18:45.011 --> 18:46.612
He'll be out
in 10 years.

18:46.680 --> 18:49.282
Unlike solo vigilantes,
they're working in concert

18:49.349 --> 18:52.217
and they're planning
and executing coordinated attacks.

18:52.286 --> 18:53.886
Their mentality
is like a lynch mob.

18:53.953 --> 18:56.088
They believe the justice system
has gone wrong

18:56.122 --> 18:57.556
and it's up to them
to set it right.

18:57.624 --> 18:59.691
Due to the pre-planning
and level of commitment,

18:59.725 --> 19:01.926
we believe our unsubs
are over 30.

19:01.994 --> 19:03.630
And they probably learned

19:03.655 --> 19:05.929
about the crimes they're
avenging through the media.

19:05.931 --> 19:07.732
It's possible
they were involved

19:07.800 --> 19:09.334
in these losses
personally

19:09.402 --> 19:12.170
and now feel
they need to act.

19:12.237 --> 19:14.839
No! I don't accept it!

19:14.907 --> 19:18.676
My baby's life was worth
more than 10 years!

19:18.743 --> 19:23.113
This latest attack felt
more improvised and personal.

19:23.181 --> 19:24.848
They didn't lure
their victim.

19:24.916 --> 19:28.752
Rather, they blitz
attacked him outside of his job.

19:28.820 --> 19:31.054
Now, during a spree,
the threat is that an unsub

19:31.122 --> 19:33.323
will either strike again
or disappear.

19:33.390 --> 19:36.592
Now, if they've completed their vendetta,
then the latter is more likely.

19:36.660 --> 19:39.061
Our unsubs may not have
prior criminal histories,

19:39.129 --> 19:41.731
as they see themselves
as do-gooders.

19:41.765 --> 19:45.034
Based on the fact that
one victim was dragged postmortem

19:45.101 --> 19:47.069
and the other
were dragged alive,

19:47.137 --> 19:51.272
we believe that one woman
is not as confident in the mission

19:51.341 --> 19:53.274
while the other
is more domineering.

19:53.343 --> 19:58.279
We're looking for mothers,
relatives, friends who have lost children.

19:58.348 --> 20:00.582
We also need to look
at the collateral damage

20:00.650 --> 20:02.417
of the crimes our current
victims committed years ago.

20:02.485 --> 20:04.885
Since this is the only thing
our unsubs have in common,

20:04.953 --> 20:06.887
it tell us
that as time goes on,

20:06.955 --> 20:10.090
their friendship will become strained
and ultimately fall apart.

20:11.092 --> 20:13.494
Hotch: So how do these
unsubs meet?

20:13.562 --> 20:15.095
Maybe they're involved
in the trials.

20:15.163 --> 20:16.731
In two different cities?

20:17.323 --> 20:18.431
I don't know.

20:18.456 --> 20:20.467
If Sam Dolan's mom was in
an online support group,

20:20.468 --> 20:21.901
maybe after
she killed herself,

20:21.969 --> 20:23.503
someone else became
obsessed with her grief.

20:23.571 --> 20:26.105
Yeah, but who'd have
that same level of interest?

20:26.173 --> 20:28.775
Let me call Garcia.

20:28.843 --> 20:29.776
[Ring, beep]

20:29.844 --> 20:31.745
- Hey, Garcia.
- At your service.

20:31.812 --> 20:33.413
Were you able to find out
anything

20:33.481 --> 20:35.481
about that online support
group Mrs. Dolan was in?

20:35.548 --> 20:38.149
Uh, let me see.
Uh, uh, uh, it had 200 members.

20:38.251 --> 20:39.351
It was an anonymous group.

20:39.419 --> 20:41.152
Did any of them start
talking about Sam Dolan

20:41.220 --> 20:43.989
about two months ago,
after his mother's suicide?

20:45.057 --> 20:47.993
Ok, uh, I've got
a screen name, Ellen R.

20:48.060 --> 20:51.263
From San Diego. She talked about
Sam in a private chat room.

20:51.330 --> 20:54.432
Did Sam Dolan's mom have any friends
or relatives with that name?

20:54.500 --> 20:57.368
Yeah, she's got a sister
Ellen Russel.

20:57.436 --> 20:58.736
She works in a boat shop.

20:58.804 --> 21:01.672
And that'd give her access
to hitching equipment.

21:01.740 --> 21:03.541
Who was she interacting
with in the support group?

21:03.609 --> 21:05.142
She talked
to a lot of people.

21:05.210 --> 21:07.844
In the last year,
she was mainly

21:07.912 --> 21:09.546
talking to a Darlene B.

21:09.614 --> 21:11.981
Kelly Taylor's mom's
name is Darlene.

21:12.049 --> 21:13.316
What's her maiden name?

21:13.384 --> 21:15.218
Beckett. In the last
6 months,

21:15.286 --> 21:17.220
most of their discussions
have been around the pending release

21:17.288 --> 21:18.855
of Mark Coleman from prison.

21:18.923 --> 21:20.424
And they probably
hatched a plan.

21:20.458 --> 21:23.126
We need to get search warrants
for Ellen's and Darlene's houses.

21:23.193 --> 21:25.260
Oh, my gosh! This just in.
So when Mark was released a month ago,

21:25.328 --> 21:27.596
her and Ellen started calling him,
posing as a friend.

21:27.631 --> 21:29.031
That would explain
the disposable cell phones.

21:29.098 --> 21:31.467
That's the trigger.
Mark's release set them off.

21:31.535 --> 21:33.302
Yeah, right, great.
So Ellen was still mad

21:33.369 --> 21:36.338
because there was no justice
served for her nephew's death,

21:36.406 --> 21:39.808
and...her and Darlene must
have agreed to swap revenge killings.

21:39.875 --> 21:41.409
And they'd avoid
getting caught.

21:41.477 --> 21:42.977
It's like
"Strangers on a Train."

21:43.078 --> 21:44.746
Yeah, but this ain't
Hitchcock, folks.

21:44.814 --> 21:47.849
Why kill Paul? He was just
a character witness for Mark.

21:47.917 --> 21:49.751
A character witness who
traveled 300 miles once a week

21:49.819 --> 21:51.185
to see his friend
in prison.

21:51.253 --> 21:53.254
Friends usually
distance themselves

21:53.322 --> 21:54.589
from rapists and murderers.

21:54.657 --> 21:55.856
Unless you're involved.

21:55.924 --> 21:58.258
Garcia, you and JJ look
into Kelly's disappearance.

21:58.326 --> 21:59.827
We need to find out
how these unsubs got to Paul

21:59.894 --> 22:02.629
and anybody else who might
have been involved in the case.

22:10.104 --> 22:12.705
All right, I'll let him know.

22:12.773 --> 22:14.373
Ok. Got it.

22:14.441 --> 22:18.177
My officers just interviewed
Darlene's ex-husband.

22:18.244 --> 22:20.879
He says she hasn't been the same
since Kelly disappeared.

22:20.947 --> 22:23.582
She's been suffering
from chronic depression.

22:23.649 --> 22:27.652
The loss of a child either brings
you together or breaks you apart.

23:20.503 --> 23:22.537
The day she disappeared,
Kelly left school early

23:22.604 --> 23:24.171
because she and her mother
were going on vacation,

23:24.239 --> 23:25.773
but she never made it home.

23:25.841 --> 23:27.742
They found her underwear
in Mark's car,

23:27.809 --> 23:29.010
which led to his confession.

23:29.044 --> 23:31.111
I got the lab results
back from Kelly's rape.

23:31.179 --> 23:33.981
It turns out there was a second
DNA sample on her underwear,

23:34.049 --> 23:35.583
but it's too degraded
to make a match.

23:35.651 --> 23:37.885
Maybe the women suspected
it was Paul's.

23:37.953 --> 23:40.042
San Diego PD just searched
Ellen's house.

23:40.043 --> 23:42.562
She's not there, but they put an officer
out front just in case she comes back.

23:42.623 --> 23:44.858
So we need to figure out
who Paul was to Mark in college.

23:44.926 --> 23:47.794
They ran cross-country, sometimes
participating in a relay together.

23:47.862 --> 23:49.128
It means
they were close.

23:49.196 --> 23:51.230
Don't 4 people do relays?

23:53.133 --> 23:55.034
[Beep]
Hey, baby girl.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.902
Hey.
Listen, we need to figure out

23:56.970 --> 23:59.805
who ran in the cross-country relay
with Paul Montgomery and Mark Coleman.

23:59.873 --> 24:02.374
Bryce Phillips
and Jason Nelson.

24:02.442 --> 24:03.976
They look inseparable.

24:04.044 --> 24:04.977
And where are they now?

24:05.045 --> 24:06.311
Bryce lives in Amsterdam,

24:06.379 --> 24:09.014
Jason in the Los Feliz area
of Los Angeles.

24:09.082 --> 24:11.576
And what was Jason's
relationship with Mark like

24:11.601 --> 24:12.617
when he went to jail?

24:12.618 --> 24:15.687
Jason was at the hearing and he
visited Mark once a week in prison,

24:15.754 --> 24:16.821
so, close?

24:16.889 --> 24:18.389
He probably participated
in the crime.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.191
And our killing duo
found out about it.

24:20.258 --> 24:21.659
That would explain
the change in M.O.

24:21.727 --> 24:24.528
Maybe Mark gave a dying declaration
and gave up his boys.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.197
Maybe our ladies
are improvising,

24:26.264 --> 24:28.331
which explains killing
Paul outside his job.

24:28.399 --> 24:30.567
We need to get to Jason's
house before they do.

24:33.270 --> 24:34.537

24:34.606 --> 24:37.040
[Glass breaking]

24:37.108 --> 24:38.441
[Turns TV off]

25:09.672 --> 25:12.040
Today's your lucky day, Jason.

25:12.108 --> 25:13.875
Who are you?
Kelly's mom.

25:13.943 --> 25:15.943
You remember Kelly,
don't you?

25:16.011 --> 25:18.012
Oh--I can explain.
I can explain.

25:18.079 --> 25:19.213
Too late.

25:19.281 --> 25:22.150
I'll do anything
you want. Ok?

25:22.217 --> 25:23.684
I could take you
to her body.

25:25.521 --> 25:27.555
Her body?

25:28.690 --> 25:30.291
You know where
my baby is?

25:30.325 --> 25:31.591
Yeah, yeah.
I can take you there.

25:31.659 --> 25:33.860
If I do that,
you'll let me go, right?

25:47.034 --> 25:48.768
[Sirens]

26:00.571 --> 26:01.537
Clear.

26:01.605 --> 26:03.340
Guys, there's broken glass
over here.

26:04.342 --> 26:06.409
And blood on the floor.

26:06.477 --> 26:08.077
Morgan! JJ!
Search the bedrooms.

26:08.144 --> 26:11.613
Blake, check outside,
see if Jason was dragged.

26:14.484 --> 26:16.518
I am serious. I am not--

26:16.586 --> 26:19.021
I'm not the same guy
that I used to be.

26:19.089 --> 26:20.256
Shut up!

26:20.323 --> 26:23.292
I think about
what I did to her every day.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.292
Which way?

26:24.360 --> 26:25.293
I--right.

26:25.361 --> 26:27.762
I--I--I have
a girlfriend now,

26:27.829 --> 26:29.063
and I have a good job.

26:29.131 --> 26:30.164
I've changed.

26:30.199 --> 26:31.399
Change is crap.

26:31.466 --> 26:33.334
Ok? People just become
more of who they are.

26:33.402 --> 26:34.535
You don't know me.

26:34.603 --> 26:36.704
Tell me what you did
to my daughter that day.

26:36.772 --> 26:37.738
Darlene...

26:37.773 --> 26:38.973
Where did you take her?

26:39.041 --> 26:40.040
Don't answer that.

26:40.108 --> 26:42.276
I have the right to know.

26:43.311 --> 26:45.145
It's complicated.

26:45.213 --> 26:46.914
She was 8 years old.

You tell me what
you did to her!

Uh...it was, uh...

27:23.917 --> 27:26.652
It was hot that day.

27:26.686 --> 27:30.054
We were all just sitting around
getting high,

27:30.121 --> 27:32.256
and then out of the blue,

27:32.324 --> 27:34.959
Mark asked if, uh,

27:35.026 --> 27:37.762
if any one of us
had ever been with a...

27:37.830 --> 27:39.597
with a little girl.

27:41.366 --> 27:43.868
I mean, of course
we said--we said no,

27:43.936 --> 27:46.970
but then someone said...

27:47.037 --> 27:49.038
that we should
go and get one.

27:50.407 --> 27:55.445
And the next thing we know,
we were out on the corner.

27:55.513 --> 27:57.547
We're waiting and...

27:57.615 --> 28:00.049
I--I--

28:00.117 --> 28:02.751
we were just about to leave...

28:03.920 --> 28:06.689
When your daughter walked by.

28:06.756 --> 28:10.192
And so you thought, we'll just
snatch this little black girl.

28:10.259 --> 28:13.261
Hey. It had nothing
to do with race.

28:13.329 --> 28:14.763
My best friend is black.

28:16.199 --> 28:17.365
It's just...

28:17.432 --> 28:19.166
Oh...

28:19.234 --> 28:23.705
Oh, Kelly, she was
just--she was so pretty. Oh--

28:23.772 --> 28:24.873
That's enough!

28:24.940 --> 28:28.275
Oh, we just lit up. Oh....

28:29.879 --> 28:32.846
Mommy should have been
on time.

28:34.983 --> 28:36.583
Son of a bitch!

28:49.963 --> 28:52.231
Aah!

Come on.
What are you doing?

28:55.602 --> 28:56.602
Oh, you think this is funny?

28:56.670 --> 28:57.837
Ohh!

28:59.105 --> 29:02.742
I have been dying to tell
that story for so long.

29:02.809 --> 29:03.743
Aah!

29:03.810 --> 29:05.944
Stop it! Stop it!

29:06.012 --> 29:07.812
- Are you serious?
- I need to find her.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.313
I need to bring her
back home.

29:09.381 --> 29:10.314
She is dead!

29:10.382 --> 29:12.918
And we are killing
this guy.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.820
No, I can't! I have got to
bring her back home.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.556
[Groans] Ellen,

29:17.623 --> 29:21.291
closure is important
to a mom.

29:21.359 --> 29:23.894
And, uh...

29:23.962 --> 29:25.829
[Coughs, groans]

29:25.897 --> 29:28.298
Whoo! Ahh.

29:28.332 --> 29:30.801
Besides, to protect myself,
I told a neighbor

29:30.869 --> 29:32.269
to write down
the license plate

29:32.336 --> 29:34.038
of any strange car
that came by.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.873
So...

29:35.941 --> 29:37.607
you were expecting us?

29:37.675 --> 29:41.611
Well, I knew you found
the first two.

29:41.679 --> 29:43.679
I assumed I'd be next.

29:48.517 --> 29:51.319
Ucch. Why are men so messy?

29:51.387 --> 29:53.822
I don't get down like this.
I'm a clean freak.

29:53.890 --> 29:57.893
Why does that
not surprise me?

29:57.961 --> 30:01.829
Something's just...
off about this guy.

30:01.897 --> 30:03.397

30:03.465 --> 30:05.700
Deep gut.

30:10.138 --> 30:14.609
Jennifer Jareau, your gut
knows what it's talking about.

30:17.377 --> 30:19.779
So nothing about Jason Nelson
seems out of the ordinary?

30:19.847 --> 30:22.148
He seems as all-American
as apple pie.

30:22.216 --> 30:24.283
No reports of any bodies found.

30:24.351 --> 30:25.619
Maybe they haven't
killed him yet.

30:25.686 --> 30:27.386
We'll keep you posted.

a run for their money.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.328
Kelly wasn't the only girl.

30:35.395 --> 30:38.397
This is all a facade.
Jason's a psychopath.

A psychopath versus
two vigilantes.

is not going to end well.

you put Kelly?

No.

30:59.852 --> 31:01.052
What do you mean?

31:01.120 --> 31:02.820

this was where she is.

31:02.888 --> 31:04.355
Well, I will take you there

31:04.422 --> 31:05.889
if you do something for me.

31:05.957 --> 31:08.492
No! This is not
a negotiation.

No. It's a bribe.

where it is.

from here.

a dime on you, remember?

31:55.003 --> 31:56.770
Yeah, we do!

31:58.307 --> 32:00.541
Darlene, just do it.

32:00.609 --> 32:02.910
I can't!

32:02.977 --> 32:05.546
Damn it!

32:17.024 --> 32:19.025
Ohh!

32:20.294 --> 32:22.329
Pow! Boom!

32:23.997 --> 32:26.164
Noo!

32:28.535 --> 32:30.736
Awesome!

32:30.803 --> 32:33.439
Oh, no, no, no!

32:33.506 --> 32:34.840
Now you take us
to her daughter.

32:37.110 --> 32:38.510
Or you're next.

32:38.511 --> 32:41.122
Ohh.

32:55.615 --> 32:58.197
The victim says he was shot
by a white woman.

32:58.198 --> 33:00.599
She was with a black woman
and a white guy.

33:00.667 --> 33:03.302
These women have been
so specific about their victims

33:03.370 --> 33:05.438
up until this point,
why shoot a random person?

33:05.505 --> 33:09.107
Jason's a psychopath.
Maybe he made them do it.

33:09.175 --> 33:10.575
He could be
holding them hostage.

33:10.642 --> 33:13.378
Or he's got something
that's keeping him alive.

33:13.446 --> 33:15.280
A bargaining chip?

33:15.348 --> 33:17.782
Maybe he knows
where Kelly's body's buried.

33:17.850 --> 33:20.385
But Ellen did the shooting,
not Darlene.

33:20.453 --> 33:22.053
Ellen tortured
the second victim.

33:22.088 --> 33:24.089
And she's helping Darlene
kill the rest of Kelly's assailants,

33:24.156 --> 33:25.722
when she could have
just walked away.

33:25.756 --> 33:27.591
So this woman
is a psychopath, too.

33:27.658 --> 33:30.394
Then Jason's made
a love connection.

33:30.462 --> 33:31.792
And he'll probably try
to manipulate Ellen

33:31.817 --> 33:33.372
to do something worse.

33:33.999 --> 33:36.600
We lost these women
a long time ago.

33:36.667 --> 33:39.970
Blake, turn Jason's place
upside down.

33:40.038 --> 33:44.407
We need to find where
they may have put Kelly's body.

33:44.475 --> 33:46.209
Ellen, why?!

33:46.276 --> 33:47.910
Now, why did you
go and do that?!

33:47.978 --> 33:49.612
We have come too far.

33:49.679 --> 33:51.381
Bull. She liked it.

33:51.448 --> 33:52.648
No, she didn't.

33:52.716 --> 33:54.550
Tell him
you didn't like that.

33:54.618 --> 33:56.352
Oh, oh, you know,

33:56.420 --> 33:57.852
if we were smart, Ellen,

33:57.920 --> 33:59.454
we'd partner up.

33:59.522 --> 34:00.455
Shut up!

34:00.523 --> 34:01.723
We could drive
across the country

34:01.790 --> 34:03.558
just killing people.

34:03.626 --> 34:05.793
I'd get my little girls,

34:05.861 --> 34:09.031
and you can get,
you know, whoever you wanted.

34:09.098 --> 34:10.065
That's enough!

34:10.132 --> 34:11.866
Wouldn't it be great...

34:11.934 --> 34:15.036
To live in a world
where no one judged you?

34:15.070 --> 34:17.771
I wouldn't judge you, baby.
I would have your back.

34:17.839 --> 34:19.540
Come on.

34:19.607 --> 34:21.775
Come on,
what do you say?

34:21.842 --> 34:25.446
If we are not at that body
in the next 20 minutes,

34:25.514 --> 34:27.848
I'm gonna take that gun and
shove it so far down your throat,

34:27.916 --> 34:30.417
you're gonna wish
you were dead.

34:30.484 --> 34:32.685
Yeah, yeah...

34:32.753 --> 34:34.987
just make a left.

34:35.056 --> 34:36.789
This is getting exciting.

34:41.695 --> 34:42.562
Hmm...

34:42.629 --> 34:44.697
Hmm hmm hmm,
let's see.

34:44.764 --> 34:48.766
I think it was over here
to the right.

34:48.833 --> 34:50.436
You think or you know?

34:50.503 --> 34:53.072
I know. I just moved it.

34:53.139 --> 34:54.206
Why would you do that?

34:54.274 --> 34:56.375
When Mark died,
I needed to cover my tracks.

34:56.443 --> 34:59.545
Uh...oh. Oh. Oh.

34:59.612 --> 35:02.012
It's right here.
I remember.

35:02.081 --> 35:04.014
Right...here.

35:04.083 --> 35:06.584
Start digging.

35:10.456 --> 35:14.525
The landlord says this is
Jason's storage closet.

35:21.132 --> 35:22.799
It looks like
my storage unit.

35:22.866 --> 35:26.002
My husband has so much crap,
it's not funny.

35:26.070 --> 35:28.338
Is it hard being in a relationship
with someone overseas?

35:28.406 --> 35:29.739
We make it work.

35:29.807 --> 35:32.242
Working for Doctors Without Borders
is a very noble cause.

35:32.310 --> 35:35.211
I would imagine you guys have
an epistolary novel by now, though.

35:35.278 --> 35:38.147
We stick to Skype.
It's modern.

35:38.215 --> 35:40.182
When we're together,
it's like we're dating,

35:40.250 --> 35:43.819
and when we're not,
I get stuff done.

35:43.886 --> 35:46.822
Look at this.

35:50.759 --> 35:52.660
Fresh loam soil.

35:52.728 --> 35:54.195
Usually found near
plains and streams.

35:54.263 --> 35:55.430
Either he was
just camping...

35:55.498 --> 35:57.165
Or used it
to move the body.

35:57.233 --> 35:59.601
Jason finds out
his friends are killed,

35:59.668 --> 36:02.437
he might take precautions.

36:04.306 --> 36:06.306
What is taking so long?

36:06.374 --> 36:08.509
I'm almost there.

36:08.576 --> 36:09.510
Hurry up!

36:09.577 --> 36:11.578
[Thud]
Oh...

36:11.646 --> 36:12.579
[Thud]

36:12.647 --> 36:16.483
Oh. Oh...

36:32.131 --> 36:34.065
There it is.

36:34.800 --> 36:38.336
That's just a skull.

36:38.404 --> 36:40.438
Where's the rest
of my daughter?

36:40.506 --> 36:43.941
We have a few more
holes to dig.

36:45.644 --> 36:47.845
You cut up my baby?

36:50.415 --> 36:52.116
That was my idea, too.

36:52.184 --> 36:54.218
Oh, my God!

36:54.286 --> 36:55.920
Oh, my God.
[Laughing]

36:55.988 --> 36:57.722
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

36:57.790 --> 37:00.991
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

37:01.059 --> 37:05.195
[Screaming]

37:12.236 --> 37:15.772
There's loam soil surrounding
some Southern California beaches

37:15.840 --> 37:18.808
and also loam soil around
some parks in the area.

37:18.875 --> 37:20.609
What areas are near
running trails?

37:20.677 --> 37:23.345
Uh, there is a trail
in the Hollywood Hills area

37:23.413 --> 37:24.825
that is lousy with loam soil.

37:24.850 --> 37:27.334
And I'm sending Morgan
and Rossi to the location now.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.901
Over here.

37:54.576 --> 37:56.510
They got him.

37:56.578 --> 37:59.680
We've got officers at Ellen
and Darlene's homes

37:59.748 --> 38:01.449
just in case
they come back.

38:01.516 --> 38:04.218
And have them check the airports,
bus stations, train stations, everything.

38:04.286 --> 38:06.553
I'll also put an APB out
along the coast.

38:06.621 --> 38:08.988
Garcia cross-checked
the trophies we found at Jason's,

38:09.056 --> 38:10.990
and they match articles
from 3 different missing children.

38:11.058 --> 38:12.392
And have officers
excavate the area

38:12.460 --> 38:13.960
around where
Jason's body was found.

38:14.027 --> 38:15.228
There may be
more bodies there.

38:15.296 --> 38:16.963
I'm on it.

38:17.030 --> 38:18.898
Blake:
At least we got Jason.

38:18.966 --> 38:21.134
He could have kept
killing forever.

38:21.201 --> 38:23.235
And the women
just get away.

38:23.303 --> 38:25.371
Hmm. For now.

38:26.539 --> 38:28.807
You ok?

38:28.875 --> 38:30.242
Yeah.

38:33.079 --> 38:35.281
Yeah.

38:37.583 --> 38:41.919
[Chatter, laughter]

38:46.292 --> 38:48.359
So now what?

38:48.427 --> 38:49.360
Well,

38:49.428 --> 38:52.497
um, we're gonna split up.

38:52.564 --> 38:54.798
I might keep heading south.

38:54.865 --> 38:56.933
You'd do good here.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.435
Yeah. You're right.

38:58.503 --> 39:02.306
I think it's better
if we don't stay together.

39:04.575 --> 39:07.411
You know what I don't get?

39:07.445 --> 39:10.780
How this was so easy for you.

39:10.847 --> 39:12.080
How so?

39:12.148 --> 39:14.082
We had to kill 5 people.

39:14.150 --> 39:15.518
Our deal was just for two.

39:15.585 --> 39:17.386
That's not what
I'm talking about.

39:17.454 --> 39:20.489
Does it bother you that none
of this took the hurt away?

39:20.557 --> 39:23.359
I never thought it would.

39:23.427 --> 39:24.860
Then why did we do it?

39:24.928 --> 39:29.130
Because somebody
has to pay, ok?

39:29.198 --> 39:31.265
I don't care
what anybody says.

39:31.334 --> 39:33.802
Actions have consequences.

39:33.869 --> 39:36.137
Maybe not at trial.

39:36.205 --> 39:38.206
Maybe not in jail.

39:38.273 --> 39:40.274
Come on.
Admit it, Darlene,

39:40.343 --> 39:42.209
this gave you
a reason to live.

39:42.276 --> 39:44.778
That's what I was hoping.

39:44.846 --> 39:48.949
But it just made me
feel more...

39:50.885 --> 39:53.053
more nothing.

39:53.120 --> 39:55.489
Then you're a wuss.

39:58.325 --> 40:00.893
I'm gonna go get us
something cold to drink.

40:00.961 --> 40:05.798
Wait. I diss you and you care
if I'm thirsty?

40:05.866 --> 40:09.301
Huh. You gotta start
thinking about yourself, honey.

40:09.370 --> 40:11.170
That's the game.

40:21.046 --> 40:22.647
Dollars ok?

40:22.715 --> 40:24.483
Gracias.

40:51.442 --> 40:52.975
Ellen Russel?

40:56.046 --> 40:57.781
How'd you find me?

40:57.815 --> 41:02.317
Darlene never unpacked
her daughter's bags from this trip.

41:02.385 --> 41:05.921
And I took a wild guess.

41:05.988 --> 41:09.691
So what happens now?

41:11.060 --> 41:14.095
What happens now
is you go back to the U.S.

41:14.163 --> 41:18.800
I take 6 days off
that I don't even want.

41:18.867 --> 41:22.102
Where's Darlene?

41:22.170 --> 41:24.204
She's long gone.

41:24.239 --> 41:28.609
Personally, I have
mixed feelings about that one.

41:29.845 --> 41:32.814
But we'll get her, too.

41:34.582 --> 41:36.416
Levantese.

42:11.116 --> 42:16.253
[Speaking spanish]

42:16.321 --> 42:18.456
...a Los estados unidos.

42:18.524 --> 42:20.157
Rossi: Thanks for your help.

42:39.409 --> 42:41.644
Rossi: Paul Brown once said,

42:41.712 --> 42:44.346
"If you win, say nothing.

42:44.414 --> 42:47.583
If you lose, say less."
