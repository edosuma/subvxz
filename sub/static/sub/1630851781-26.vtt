00:01.069 --> 00:02.636
- * Hey, here comes Sunny
keeping it fun *

00:02.736 --> 00:04.238
* Never says never,
never gives up *

00:04.338 --> 00:06.540
* It's Sunny,
yeah, she's Sunny *

00:06.640 --> 00:08.109
* Hey

00:08.209 --> 00:09.943
* Gear up and go
in the Glam Van *

00:10.044 --> 00:11.745
* Hair styling
with her best friends *

00:11.845 --> 00:14.215
* It's Sunny,
yeah, she's Sunny *

00:14.315 --> 00:17.118
* Oh, it's a Sunny Day

00:17.218 --> 00:19.553
* She'll put a smile
on your face *

00:19.653 --> 00:21.189
- Whoo-hoo!

00:21.289 --> 00:25.993
- * Sunny is shining
all the way *

00:26.094 --> 00:28.996
* Yeah, she's Sunny,
yeah, she's Sunny *

00:29.097 --> 00:31.499
* Having a sunny, sunny day

00:31.599 --> 00:32.833
- Hoo-hoo!

00:43.911 --> 00:45.913
- Check out
this move, Rox!

00:46.013 --> 00:48.316
- You'll never
get past me!

00:48.416 --> 00:50.050
- Watch me!

00:50.151 --> 00:51.985
- Ah!

00:52.086 --> 00:54.288
- Look out below!

00:54.388 --> 00:56.457
- Got it!
- Whoa! Nice catch!

00:56.557 --> 00:57.558
- Oops!

00:57.658 --> 00:58.992
- Here you go!

00:59.093 --> 01:00.361
- Thanks, Sunny!

01:00.461 --> 01:02.096
- Sorry about that,
Johnny-Ray!

01:02.196 --> 01:04.598
Now,
where was I?

01:04.698 --> 01:07.535
One more snip here.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.470
And you're
all done!

01:09.570 --> 01:12.273
- Thanks, Sunny!
Good as new!

01:12.373 --> 01:13.474
[phone trilling]

01:13.574 --> 01:14.775
Oh! I'm late!

01:14.875 --> 01:16.444
Got to pick up
Suzette!

01:16.544 --> 01:17.845
See you later!

01:17.945 --> 01:20.181
And watch out for flying
soccer balls!

01:20.281 --> 01:21.482
- [giggles]

01:21.582 --> 01:24.885
[cheerful music]

01:24.985 --> 01:26.720
- Thanks for
coming, Johnny-Rae!

01:26.820 --> 01:28.522
Have a
sunny day!

01:28.622 --> 01:31.192
[gasps]
Who-oa!

01:31.292 --> 01:33.161
- [gasps]

01:33.261 --> 01:34.562
- Got it!

01:36.630 --> 01:38.299
- And here
comes Junior!

01:38.399 --> 01:40.501
Driving the ball
toward the goal!

01:40.601 --> 01:41.769
He winds
up to kick--

01:41.869 --> 01:44.205
And-- Whoa!
Way off the mark!

01:44.305 --> 01:45.673
- Whoa!

01:46.674 --> 01:49.243
But a brilliant
deflection by Rox!

01:49.343 --> 01:50.678
All: Look out!

01:50.778 --> 01:52.846
And what a save
by Blair!

01:52.946 --> 01:56.049
Now that was
a cage-rattler!

01:56.150 --> 01:57.751
[triumphant music]

01:57.851 --> 02:00.288
- Sorry, Blair!
Didn't mean to hit you!

02:00.388 --> 02:01.955
But great
defense!

02:02.055 --> 02:03.557
- Really?
[nervous laugh]

02:03.657 --> 02:05.626
I'm not even
sure what I did!

02:05.726 --> 02:07.895
- Whatever it was,
keep doing it!

02:07.995 --> 02:09.830
- Junior,
you need to

02:09.930 --> 02:11.899
work on your
aim a little.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.667
- I just need
more room,

02:13.767 --> 02:15.669
and a lot
more practice!

02:15.769 --> 02:17.605
Can we go
to the park?

02:19.507 --> 02:21.008
- No more
customers today.

02:21.108 --> 02:23.377
- And it is
too nice a day

02:23.477 --> 02:24.678
to be indoors.
- [gasps]

02:24.778 --> 02:27.448
- Good idea, Junior!
Let's all go!

02:27.548 --> 02:29.817
- Yeah, we'll get
a real game going.

02:29.917 --> 02:33.754
- First, I think we'd
better change our clothes.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.623
And, we're going to
need to do something

02:35.723 --> 02:37.591
about our hair.

02:37.691 --> 02:42.296
I have an idea for some
sweet soccer styles.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.598
Let's get to work!

02:44.698 --> 02:49.169
Blair, I'm giving you
cute soccer twists.

02:49.270 --> 02:52.240
Gather up
this piece,

02:52.340 --> 02:54.775
and then
that piece,

02:54.875 --> 02:56.744
Twist,
Twist,

02:56.844 --> 02:59.580
bring them
together.

03:02.416 --> 03:05.219
Some hair bands.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.622
And for the
finishing touch:

03:08.722 --> 03:11.225
Some black
hair chalk.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.028
Rox, you're
up next.

03:15.729 --> 03:18.266
You're going to love
this style, Rox.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.936
Let's pull
this back.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.005
First I'll
make a bun.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.743
Now to turn this...

03:32.780 --> 03:34.482
Into this!

03:34.582 --> 03:37.351
Your very
own soccer ball!

03:37.451 --> 03:38.586
- [gasps]
I love it!

03:38.686 --> 03:40.621
- My turn!

03:43.424 --> 03:46.860
We're going to have
so much fun today!

03:48.596 --> 03:51.198
Twist,
twist.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.369
Almost done!

04:01.642 --> 04:03.043
A little
hairspray.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.479
- You girls
are styling!

04:05.579 --> 04:09.049
- [giggles]
Thanks!

04:09.149 --> 04:09.850
- [gasps]

04:09.950 --> 04:12.386
- Look out!
- Smile!

04:12.486 --> 04:16.056
That's definitely one
for the Style Files!

04:16.156 --> 04:19.393
Now it's time to get
changed into uniforms.

04:20.928 --> 04:24.231
- Cool!
Uniforms!

04:24.332 --> 04:25.466
- Glad you
like 'em!

04:25.566 --> 04:28.101
'Cause we have one
for you too!

04:28.201 --> 04:31.271
- Awesome!
- Let's go put these on!

04:31.372 --> 04:32.673
- Sorry, Doodle.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.708
Couldn't find
one your size.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.844
- I don't
need a uniform!

04:36.944 --> 04:38.612
I've got these!

04:38.712 --> 04:40.714
I'm going to be
the cheerleader!

04:40.814 --> 04:42.583
Grab a net
and soccer balls,

04:42.683 --> 04:44.652
let's play a game
in Friendly Falls!

04:44.752 --> 04:46.420
Go-o-o
team!

04:46.520 --> 04:47.921
- [giggles]

04:49.623 --> 04:53.761
- We look amazing!
- Go-o-o team!

04:53.861 --> 04:56.229
- Okay,
everybody.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.765
Ready, set--

04:57.865 --> 05:00.300
All: Gear up
and go!

05:00.401 --> 05:03.404
[upbeat banjo music]

05:03.504 --> 05:10.744
*

05:16.283 --> 05:18.085
- Two, four,
six, eight,

05:18.185 --> 05:20.488
Got to practice
to be great!

05:21.789 --> 05:23.624
Eight, six,
four, two,

05:23.724 --> 05:25.793
Kick the ball and--

05:25.893 --> 05:27.795
Lose a shoe?

05:27.895 --> 05:30.130
- Guess I
must have slipped.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.535
- Here, Junior,
try this.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.105
Keep your ankle
locked when you kick.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.943
- Ankle locked,
okay.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.012
[drum roll]

05:45.112 --> 05:46.614
- [gasps]
Whoa!

05:46.714 --> 05:48.882
- Oops.
Sorry, Sunny!

05:48.982 --> 05:50.651
- [muffled]
No problem!

05:50.751 --> 05:52.019
[spits]

05:52.119 --> 05:54.221
Straighten that out,
and you've got it!

05:54.321 --> 05:56.123
- [panting]
I chased it down!

05:56.223 --> 05:57.558
Is there
a position that

05:57.658 --> 05:59.226
doesn't require
so much running?

05:59.326 --> 06:01.729
- Maybe you'd like to
play goalie, Blair!

06:01.829 --> 06:03.964
You were great
back at the salon.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.633
- I think it
was just luck.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.768
But sure! I'll
be the goalie.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.503
Bring it on!

06:15.543 --> 06:17.811
- Goalies
usually face...

06:17.911 --> 06:20.147
this way.
- Oh! Right!

06:20.247 --> 06:22.082
I'll get it,
thanks!

06:22.182 --> 06:24.117
Sunny, Rox,
Junior, Blair!

06:24.217 --> 06:26.119
They're a team
beyond compare!

06:26.219 --> 06:28.088
Kick that ball,
style that hair,

06:28.188 --> 06:31.158
Sunny, Rox,
Junior, Blair!

06:34.227 --> 06:36.797
- [squeals]
[grunts]

06:36.897 --> 06:38.766
This is harder
than I thought!

06:38.866 --> 06:40.501
- Just keep
trying, Blair.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.836
You'll get it!

06:45.005 --> 06:47.007
- Ankle locked.
[grunts]

06:47.975 --> 06:49.810
[dejected sigh]

06:50.944 --> 06:52.880
- I did it!

06:52.980 --> 06:54.815
- That's okay,
Junior.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.684
If at first,
you miss the play,

06:56.784 --> 06:58.318
Just keep trying,
that's the--

06:58.418 --> 06:59.487
- Hey!

06:59.587 --> 07:01.121
Yeah! I'm
talking to you!

07:01.221 --> 07:02.790
Get off
our field!

07:02.890 --> 07:04.191
- Your field?

07:04.291 --> 07:06.894
- This is where I
always fly my kite.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.261
Right, KC?

07:08.361 --> 07:09.997
- Always.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.298
And this is where
I'm going to

07:11.398 --> 07:12.299
fly my kite today.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.901
So I'll say it
one more time.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.836
Get. Off.
Our. Field.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.071
- Lacey, this isn't
just your field.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.473
It's for
everybody.

07:19.573 --> 07:22.342
- [angry growl]
- She's right, Lacey.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.678
There's lots of
room on the other side

07:24.778 --> 07:26.246
of the park.
Why don't we just

07:26.346 --> 07:27.981
fly our kite
over there?

07:28.081 --> 07:29.783
- Yeah!
Go fly your kite

07:29.883 --> 07:30.918
somewhere else!

07:31.018 --> 07:32.653
- [angry growl]

07:32.753 --> 07:34.121
- [nervous laughter]

07:34.221 --> 07:35.723
- [scoffs] You don't
even need a real field.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.124
'Cause you're not
a real soccer team.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.026
- We have uniforms,
don't we?

07:39.126 --> 07:41.261
- Awesome uniforms!

07:41.361 --> 07:42.563
- Hmm.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.098
Uniforms are supposed
to say who you are.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.900
Your team doesn't
even have a name.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.002
- We do too!
We're the--

07:49.102 --> 07:50.904
Uh--
- The name of our team

07:51.004 --> 07:52.506
is 'Sunny's Squad!'

07:52.606 --> 07:54.274
And I'm
the cheerleader.

07:54.374 --> 07:56.176
- Yeah!
- Good name, Doodle!

07:56.276 --> 07:57.778
- That's us!
- [giggles]

07:57.878 --> 08:00.648
- And we can beat
any team, any time!

08:00.748 --> 08:02.750
- Okay, then.
Prove it.

08:02.850 --> 08:05.218
Beat my team.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.756
- Your team?

08:08.856 --> 08:10.691
- 'Lacey's Lineup!'

08:10.791 --> 08:13.226
So, you want to
play? Or what?

08:14.695 --> 08:16.597
- You're on!

08:18.699 --> 08:20.734
- Sunny's Squad
versus Lacey's Lineup.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.269
- This is
gonna be great!

08:22.369 --> 08:24.271
[Sunny's Squad cheering]

08:24.371 --> 08:25.639
- Um--
heh-heh.

08:25.739 --> 08:28.341
Is it all right
if I don't play?

08:28.441 --> 08:30.744
'Cause I can't
really kick a ball.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.746
Chase a ball,
I'm your dog.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.448
But kick,
not so much.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.985
- Okay, KC. You can
sit this one out.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.420
- [humming]
- Um, we might have

08:40.520 --> 08:42.089
one other problem.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.727
- Hi, Peter! Did you
lose something?

08:46.827 --> 08:49.229
- Hi, Sunny!
Hi, everybody!

08:49.329 --> 08:51.732
No, I didn't
lose anything.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.001
I just can't find
what I'm looking for.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.169
- Did that make
sense to you?

08:56.269 --> 08:57.605
- Mm-mm.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.607
- I've been searching
for this rare plant.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.942
The Friendly Falls
Live-Forever.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.611
I heard it
grows in the park,

09:03.711 --> 09:05.545
and I wanted
to see one for myself!

09:05.646 --> 09:06.914
- Well you
can't look here.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.849
We're about
to start a game!

09:08.949 --> 09:10.884
- Maybe he'd like
to play with us.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.786
How about it,
Peter?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.187
- No, I
really should keep-

09:14.287 --> 09:16.289
- That's right,
we need another player.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.858
- You'll do.

09:17.958 --> 09:18.859
- Oof!

09:18.959 --> 09:20.060
- Welcome
to the team!

09:20.160 --> 09:23.463
- Okay, guess
I can look later.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.766
- Great! Glad
to have you, Peter!

09:25.866 --> 09:27.367
- That still
only gives us

09:27.467 --> 09:29.770
three players, and
you have four.

09:29.870 --> 09:30.738
No fair!

09:30.838 --> 09:32.539
- I'll sit
out first.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.307
That'll make
the teams even.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.043
- All right.
So.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.779
What exactly are we
playing for, anyway?

09:38.879 --> 09:41.148
- Uh--
To see who can win?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.050
- And even that
doesn't matter.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.918
It's just for
the fun of playing!

09:45.018 --> 09:46.519
- Fun? What's
the point if

09:46.620 --> 09:47.921
you can't
win something?

09:48.021 --> 09:49.890
Like,
a gold star.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.359
Or a year's supply
of bubble gum.

09:52.459 --> 09:53.927
- [neighing]
- Look out!

09:54.027 --> 09:55.528
Pony on
the loose!

09:55.629 --> 09:57.698
- [neighing]
- [panting]

09:57.798 --> 09:59.667
- Oh, ow!
Oh!

09:59.767 --> 10:01.769
Slow down!

10:03.303 --> 10:06.273
- [neighing]
- Ah!

10:06.373 --> 10:07.841
- [scared moans]
- Aw!

10:07.941 --> 10:10.410
- [gasps]
Hold on, Johnny-Rae!

10:10.510 --> 10:12.980
I've got
just the thing.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.648
Some ribbon,

10:14.748 --> 10:16.616
a knot,
nice and tight.

10:16.717 --> 10:19.352
Ah!
- [surprised neigh]

10:21.989 --> 10:23.223
- Gotcha!

10:23.323 --> 10:25.092
- Nice twirling
there, Sunny!

10:25.192 --> 10:26.393
And sorry,
Peter.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.962
Don't know what
got into Suzette.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.365
- What is
all this stuff?

10:32.465 --> 10:34.234
- Prizes for
the arcade booth.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.903
We were just
delivering them

10:36.003 --> 10:38.706
to the Boardwalk.
Oh!

10:38.806 --> 10:41.408
- Whoa!
Nice trophy!

10:41.508 --> 10:44.211
Now that's what
I'm talkin' about!

10:44.311 --> 10:47.214
Winner gets this
sparkly baby!

10:47.314 --> 10:49.482
- That's a
great idea, Lacey!

10:49.582 --> 10:51.819
As long as it's
okay with Johnny-Rae?

10:51.919 --> 10:53.854
- Sure,
it's okay!

10:53.954 --> 10:55.522
What are we
talking about?

10:55.622 --> 10:57.257
- We want to
play soccer, but--

10:57.357 --> 11:00.260
- Lacey won't play unless
she can win something.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.196
- So if you don't
mind donating a trophy?

11:03.296 --> 11:05.632
- Always happy
to help out!

11:05.733 --> 11:06.934
- In that case,

11:07.034 --> 11:09.069
would you mind being
our referee, too?

11:09.169 --> 11:12.706
- Why not? I've already
got a whistle.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.042
- I've got tails!

11:15.142 --> 11:17.377
So, you get
heads, Sunny.

11:17.477 --> 11:20.247
- Heads! That means
Sunny's team kicks off.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.882
- [angry growl]
- Yes!

11:21.982 --> 11:23.350
[Sunny's Squad cheering]

11:23.450 --> 11:26.119
- And a hush falls
over the crowd as the game

11:26.219 --> 11:28.188
is about to begin.
- [neighing]

11:28.288 --> 11:31.491
- I said, a hush
falls over the crowd!

11:31.591 --> 11:33.493
- [nickers]

11:33.593 --> 11:35.162
- Junior winds up!

11:35.262 --> 11:37.630
- Kicks!
- Yah! [gasps]

11:37.731 --> 11:38.932
[sad groan]

11:39.032 --> 11:42.069
- And, just slightly
off the mark!

11:42.169 --> 11:45.205
- And Sunny's Squad
gets off to a shaky start!

11:45.305 --> 11:47.908
They're no match
for Lacey's Lineup!

11:48.008 --> 11:50.143
- Hey! That's
my microphone!

11:50.243 --> 11:52.445
- Heh heh, sorry.

11:55.148 --> 11:58.651
[drum roll]

11:58.752 --> 12:00.053
- Huh!

12:00.153 --> 12:02.055
- [grunts]

12:03.891 --> 12:05.592
- [rhythmic panting]

12:07.060 --> 12:08.295
- Whoa!

12:08.395 --> 12:10.697
- Wow!
Lacey's really good!

12:10.798 --> 12:12.199
- [neighs]

12:12.966 --> 12:15.435
- Yikes!
[wails]

12:15.535 --> 12:16.770
- Yes!
[whistle blows]

12:16.870 --> 12:18.038
- Oh!

12:18.138 --> 12:20.273
- Go-o-oal!

12:20.373 --> 12:22.776
[both laughing]
Both: Yeah!

12:22.876 --> 12:24.077
- Yes!

12:24.177 --> 12:26.546
- You'll get it
next time, Blair.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.417
Junior,
I'm open!

12:30.517 --> 12:32.319
- Hey, Junior,
look over there!

12:32.419 --> 12:34.788
- Huh?
What?

12:34.888 --> 12:36.924
- Ha-ha!
- Hey, no fair!

12:37.024 --> 12:38.258
- You're right,
Junior.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.494
But it's not against
the rules. Sorry.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.296
- Aww...

12:44.998 --> 12:46.566
- Come on, 'Cin!

12:46.666 --> 12:48.168
- [cries out]

12:49.336 --> 12:50.838
- Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
- Yeah!

12:50.938 --> 12:52.840
- And that makes
3 to nothing,

12:52.940 --> 12:54.174
for Lacey's Lineup!

12:54.274 --> 12:56.476
- [neighs angrily]

12:56.576 --> 13:00.013
- Oh, alright.
Two to nothing.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.818
- Uh!

13:05.752 --> 13:08.388
- Whoa!
[Lacey and Cindy gasp]

13:09.222 --> 13:11.324
- [Repeating] Please don't kick
it to me,

13:11.424 --> 13:12.659
please do--
Oh!

13:12.759 --> 13:14.361
- They're kicking it to me!
[yells]

13:14.461 --> 13:16.263
Oof! Aww...
[whistle blowing]

13:16.363 --> 13:18.498
- Yeah!
Way to go!

13:18.598 --> 13:20.533
And now it's
2 to 1!

13:20.633 --> 13:22.535
- All right!
- Woo-hoo!

13:22.635 --> 13:25.138
- Ugh...
We need to stop them.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.340
Hmm...
Oh, Sunny!

13:27.440 --> 13:30.077
Do you have
a hairpin I could borrow?

13:30.177 --> 13:31.511
- Sure, Lacey!
You know,

13:31.611 --> 13:33.046
if your hair's
slowing you down,

13:33.146 --> 13:35.215
I could put it up
in a braid like ours.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.251
- No thanks.
This'll do fine.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.289
- [devious giggle]
[hissing]

13:43.623 --> 13:45.859
- [gasps]
Ball sprung a leak!

13:45.959 --> 13:47.227
Can't play
anymore.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.428
Game over,
we win.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.230
- Hmm,
let's see.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.564
You might be right.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.566
Unless we can find
a way to put

13:53.666 --> 13:54.701
more air in it.

13:54.801 --> 13:57.537
- [gasps] We can make
our own air pump!

13:59.139 --> 14:02.042
Let's see.
A curler,

14:02.142 --> 14:03.810
a hair dryer.

14:03.911 --> 14:07.414
This ought to
do it!

14:07.514 --> 14:09.049
There! Good
as new!

14:09.149 --> 14:10.283
- [gasps]
- Okay!

14:10.383 --> 14:12.052
Game's
still on!

14:12.152 --> 14:14.687
- Play ball!
Woo-hoo!

14:14.787 --> 14:15.488
- Really?

14:15.588 --> 14:18.191
- Oh, heh.
Right.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.395
- Oof!

14:23.596 --> 14:24.497
- Ha ha!

14:24.597 --> 14:26.833
- Great save!
- Lucky break.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.040
- Ah! Oh!

14:33.140 --> 14:34.241
- Yeah!

14:34.341 --> 14:36.709
- Lucky break.
- Great save!

14:37.877 --> 14:38.912
- Yah!

14:39.446 --> 14:41.148
- Just keep
trying, Junior!

14:41.248 --> 14:42.215
You'll get it!

14:42.315 --> 14:43.750
- [sad sigh]

14:44.717 --> 14:46.019
- [grunts]

14:46.553 --> 14:49.256
- Haha!
Oh, hey!

14:50.157 --> 14:51.391
- I've got this.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.826
- [panicked stammering]

14:53.927 --> 14:55.128
- Hah!

14:55.228 --> 14:56.696
- [grunts]
Ha-ha-ha!

14:56.796 --> 14:58.565
Both: Who's the
greatest, who's the best?

14:58.665 --> 15:00.500
Who's the team
that beats the rest!

15:00.600 --> 15:03.536
- Sunny's Squad!
- Lacey's Lineup!

15:04.337 --> 15:06.206
- [neighs]
- [giggling]

15:06.306 --> 15:07.674
- [grunts]

15:09.776 --> 15:10.577
- I can do it.

15:10.677 --> 15:14.747
- I can do it!
[gasps]

15:14.847 --> 15:16.783
- Blair!
Look out!

15:16.883 --> 15:19.119
- [wails]
Oh...

15:19.219 --> 15:20.687
[whistle blows]
- [gasps]

15:20.787 --> 15:22.755
- That's right, folks!
Junior has just

15:22.855 --> 15:24.491
scored a goal
for the other team!

15:24.591 --> 15:26.426
That makes it
3 to 1 in favor

15:26.526 --> 15:28.761
of Lacey's Lineup!

15:28.861 --> 15:30.830
- [sad sigh]

15:33.433 --> 15:35.902
- Yeah!
Thanks, Junior!

15:36.003 --> 15:38.371
- Ha-ha-ha,
ye-e-es!

15:38.471 --> 15:41.374
- Don't feel bad.
You kicked it really well.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.942
- But in the
wrong direction.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.745
I can't believe I scored
for the other team.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.847
- It's my fault
too, Junior.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.582
I should have
stopped it.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.618
- KC, go back
to the house and

15:51.718 --> 15:53.353
clear a space
on the shelf.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.523
'Cause I'm bringing
home that trophy!

15:56.623 --> 15:57.657
- Remember,
Junior,

15:57.757 --> 15:59.126
it's all
just for fun.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.527
- Some fun.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.796
I can't seem to do
anything right today.

16:03.896 --> 16:07.467
[sighs] I'll sit
out for a while.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.402
- Oh, you don't
have to do that.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.338
It's Rox's turn
to play.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.673
It'll be better
for the team.

16:15.308 --> 16:19.012
- [nickers]
- [sad sigh]

16:19.112 --> 16:20.880
- Let's go!

16:23.116 --> 16:26.919
- You may be good,
but I'm better.

16:31.524 --> 16:32.559
- [worried yelling]

16:32.659 --> 16:34.261
- [grunts]
- Hah!

16:34.361 --> 16:35.795
- Oh,
oh!

16:35.895 --> 16:37.064
Aww.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.332
- Woo-hoo!
- Go, Rox!

16:39.432 --> 16:41.601
- [disgusted scoff]
- [worried whine]

16:41.701 --> 16:43.403
- And it's
3 to 2!

16:43.503 --> 16:45.872
- Too close
for comfort!

16:49.642 --> 16:51.744
- [devious laughter]

16:53.146 --> 16:55.415
Cindy!
Over here!

16:55.515 --> 16:58.051
- Woo!
- [gasps]

16:58.151 --> 16:59.052
- [grunts]
- [gasps]

16:59.152 --> 17:00.053
- [dejected sigh]

17:00.153 --> 17:02.122
- Goal!
Woo-hoo!

17:02.222 --> 17:04.857
- What a play!
What a play!

17:04.957 --> 17:05.958
[whistle blowing]

17:06.059 --> 17:07.194
- No goal!

17:07.294 --> 17:09.129
- Ugh!
What do you mean?

17:09.229 --> 17:10.497
It went in!

17:10.597 --> 17:12.765
- Lacey, we all
saw you kick the ball

17:12.865 --> 17:16.069
through that hole. It didn't
cross the goal line.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.570
So, it
doesn't count.

17:17.670 --> 17:21.040
- But--
Well, I-I--

17:21.141 --> 17:22.309
- [furious growl]

17:22.409 --> 17:24.811
- Lacey, even if
you break the rules,

17:24.911 --> 17:28.581
I'll fix 'em!
I've got hair ribbon!

17:31.818 --> 17:33.453
- Hmm...

17:35.422 --> 17:36.723
[satisfied grunt]

17:37.290 --> 17:39.459
Hmm...
There! Done!

17:39.559 --> 17:40.993
- [frustrated growl]

17:42.895 --> 17:44.397
- Uh!
- [both gasp]

17:44.497 --> 17:45.765
- Oof!
Ugh...

17:45.865 --> 17:49.769
[both cheering]
- Yay, Lacey's Lineup!

17:49.869 --> 17:53.273
- This is a lot harder
than managing a salon.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.042
[furious cry]

17:56.143 --> 17:57.910
[all gasp]
- Whoa!

17:59.045 --> 17:59.946
- Huh?
- [gasps]

18:00.046 --> 18:01.080
- Look out!

18:01.181 --> 18:03.483
- [grunts]
[all gasp]

18:03.583 --> 18:06.753
- [gasps] An
unbelievable save!

18:06.853 --> 18:09.456
- Junior! That
was amazing!

18:09.556 --> 18:12.892
- I'll say! You should
be our goalie!

18:12.992 --> 18:15.362
- I was just lucky.
Doodle and KC

18:15.462 --> 18:16.629
were going to get hit.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.965
But I could never
do that again.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.500
- Never say never!

18:20.600 --> 18:21.968
I know you can!

18:22.068 --> 18:23.770
- And why didn't
you tell us

18:23.870 --> 18:25.738
you could kick
like that, Blair?

18:25.838 --> 18:27.407
- I didn't
know I could!

18:27.507 --> 18:29.376
I never
tried it before.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.044
- You're both
great players,

18:32.145 --> 18:34.847
We just had you
at the wrong positions!

18:34.947 --> 18:36.483
- Junior,
get in goal!

18:36.583 --> 18:38.551
- Blair, you take
forward with Rox!

18:38.651 --> 18:40.520
I'll sit
out for now.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.789
- But--
- Junior, we need you!

18:42.889 --> 18:44.524
And you, too,
Blair!

18:44.624 --> 18:47.994
- Me? The goalie?
I don't know...

18:48.761 --> 18:50.129
All: Don't give up!

18:50.230 --> 18:51.664
* Sometimes you'll
have a day *

18:51.764 --> 18:53.065
* When nothing goes
your way *

18:53.166 --> 18:54.767
* You want to sing but
all your *

18:54.867 --> 18:56.636
* Lyrics come out wrong;
don't give up! *

18:56.736 --> 18:58.705
* Never give up!
If you try to dance *

18:58.805 --> 19:00.373
* But you trip and fall
If you're playing catch *

19:00.473 --> 19:03.410
* And you drop the ball,
then maybe you should *

19:03.510 --> 19:06.078
* Listen to this song

19:06.179 --> 19:07.747
* Don't give up,
don't give up *

19:07.847 --> 19:09.449
* Never give,
never give up *

19:09.549 --> 19:11.718
* Woo! Never
say never and *

* Oh, look, if at
first you don't succeed *

19:16.956 --> 19:18.891

and try again *

19:18.991 --> 19:22.128

I just gotta find a way *

19:22.229 --> 19:23.796

never give up *

19:23.896 --> 19:26.098
* It might be right
before your eyes *

19:26.199 --> 19:28.000
* Sometimes it just
takes hair supplies *

19:28.100 --> 19:31.638
* And I can make my
own sunny day *

19:31.738 --> 19:33.940

don't give up *

19:49.456 --> 19:50.757
- Woo!

19:50.857 --> 19:53.560

we might be in trouble.

19:53.660 --> 19:57.129

Sunny's Squad: 4!

19:57.230 --> 20:00.733

a tie game!

20:00.833 --> 20:03.069

I need a break.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.572

- Phew!

20:05.672 --> 20:07.507

plays her best.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.509
She does not
like to lose.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.278

[mean laughter]

20:11.378 --> 20:13.413

One minute!

Junior!

20:24.624 --> 20:26.859

Eight, seven,

perfect aim!

20:48.147 --> 20:50.850
Sunny's Squad has
won the game!

20:50.950 --> 20:52.184

20:55.488 --> 20:56.789

20:56.889 --> 20:59.258
- Good game, guys!
[all congratulating]

20:59.359 --> 21:00.660
- Ugh.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.930
Good game.
I guess.

21:05.898 --> 21:08.134

Don't even
think about it.

21:31.324 --> 21:32.492
[ball being kicked]

21:32.592 --> 21:34.427

21:34.527 --> 21:37.296
