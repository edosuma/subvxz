[ Panting ]

>> Gumball: Well, i hope they
like lasagna in China.
>> Darwin: I'll do the groceries

14:36.910 --> 14:41.312
with anais, thank you very much.
What right did he have to crush
the dreams of a poor young

14:41.314 --> 14:44.649
t-Rex?
She could have made a song that
only had four notes, but no!

14:44.651 --> 14:48.887
He makes a big deal like I'm the
one who let him down, when he's
the one who let me down.

14:48.889 --> 14:52.590
You know what i mean?
>> Anais: No, Darwin.
I've absolutely no grasp of the

14:52.592 --> 14:57.462
incredibly simple concept you've
explained eight times already!
>> Darwin: Okay, well, let me

14:57.464 --> 15:00.331
start from the beginning.
>> Anais: [ Muffled ] Aaaaaaaah!
>> Darwin: All he had to do was

15:00.333 --> 15:02.734
move a plate to help me.
Is that really equal to me
having to fight...

15:02.736 --> 15:06.204
>> Gumball: A t-Rex standing
over me like this!
But instead, he's so concerned

15:06.206 --> 15:09.674
with the ins and outs and the
rights and wrongs...
>> Dad: My hands don't match.

15:09.676 --> 15:13.411
>> Gumball: ...Instead of
acknowledging the cast-iron
truth that a 4-fingered dinosaur

15:13.413 --> 15:16.047
cannot play the piano!
Does this look like music to
you?!

15:16.049 --> 15:18.283
>> Dad: [ Whimpers ]
>> Gumball: Anyway, what I'm
trying to say is that...

15:18.285 --> 15:21.819
>> Darwin: He let<i> me</i> down!
And it's not the first time it's
happened.

15:21.821 --> 15:25.056
>> Anais: Shh!
[ Whispering ] Can you hear
that?

15:25.058 --> 15:28.893
>> Darwin: What?
>> Anais: How good it sounds
when you're not whining?!

15:28.895 --> 15:32.931
[ Sighs ]
Now, I'm gonna say it once.
If you have a problem with

15:32.933 --> 15:37.435

I'm gonna speak to him right
now.

This is gonna take a while.

15:53.887 --> 15:57.355
>> Gumball: [ Grunting ]
>> Darwin: [ Grunts ]
Look.

15:57.357 --> 16:00.325
I just want to say that I'm
sorry.
I should've been there for you,

16:00.327 --> 16:04.495
and i -- i hope you can forgive
me.
>> Gumball: Okay. I forgive you.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.732
>> Darwin: don't you think you
should apologize as well?
>> Gumball: Dude, you

16:07.734 --> 16:10.168
apologized.
End of story.
I'm not gonna say sorry just

16:10.170 --> 16:13.271
'cause it'll make you feel less
guilty.
<i>You're</i> the one who let<i> me</i> down.

16:13.273 --> 16:16.274
>> Darwin: Oh, that wasn't
letting you down.
This is.

16:16.276 --> 16:20.745
>> Gumball: [ Straining ]
>> Darwin: Apologize.
>> Gumball: Never!

16:20.747 --> 16:24.349

>> Darwin: Apologize!
>> Gumball: Dad, help!

Oh, very good.
Well, let's see if you can

16:33.426 --> 16:36.961
imitate this!
>> Darwin: Apologize.
>> Gumball: Is that all you've

16:36.963 --> 16:40.765
got left in stock?
>> Darwin: Apologize.
>> Gumball: [ Straining ] Never.

16:40.767 --> 16:44.969

17:14.467 --> 17:19.370
have a little talk.
Now, we need to rebuild the
trust that you lost.

17:19.372 --> 17:23.674
On the plate to your right are
the cupcakes.
On the plate to your left is the

17:23.676 --> 17:27.478
bad food, like liver and stuff.
[ Tink! ]
What you need to do is trust the

good food.

I expected a mouthful of rat

trust you, buddy!

was...

flaking out on me at the
supermarket.
>> Gumball: What?!

17:53.173 --> 17:56.607
What'd you do?
>> Anais: The cupcakes you just
ingested were laced with

17:56.609 --> 18:01.479
parasitic eggs.
All they needed to hatch was a
moist, warm environment -- your

18:01.481 --> 18:04.048
stomach.
>> Gumball: [ Yelps ]
What's gonna happen to us?!

18:04.050 --> 18:06.784
>> Anais: First, they'll eat
their way into your stomach
lining.

18:06.786 --> 18:10.054
>> Gumball: What?!
>> Anais: Then, they will crawl
up your head and lay eggs in

18:10.056 --> 18:12.323
your eyeballs.
>> Darwin: [ Screams ]
Get them out!!

18:12.325 --> 18:16.861

to lure them out.

have to do this for?

way out.

I would've thought the

19:05.645 --> 19:08.146

better driver.
