And one,

00:29.680 --> 00:30.680
and two,

00:31.040 --> 00:32.109
and three...

00:32.280 --> 00:34.430
<i>The female
body is a complex thing.</i>

00:34.800 --> 00:36.392
<i>At once fragile,</i>

00:36.640 --> 00:37.640
<i>and formidable,</i>

00:38.040 --> 00:39.871
<i>vulnerable, and brave.</i>

00:40.920 --> 00:43.070
<i>It carries the seed of our hopes,</i>

00:43.800 --> 00:45.233
<i>the bloom of our youth,</i>

00:45.840 --> 00:47.592
<i>the weight of our fears.</i>

00:48.200 --> 00:50.236
<i>It can nurture, and tremble,</i>

00:50.560 --> 00:53.233
<i>inspire and terrify.</i>

00:54.200 --> 00:56.395
<i>It oppresses and protects us,</i>

00:56.840 --> 00:58.876
<i>holding within it all that we are,</i>

00:59.120 --> 01:01.270
<i>projecting less than we wish to be.</i>

01:01.640 --> 01:02.993
<i>It is our enemy,</i>

01:03.240 --> 01:04.239
<i>our friend,</i>

01:04.599 --> 01:06.830
<i>the very vessel of our being.</i>

01:09.080 --> 01:10.638
<i>What the body takes,</i>

01:11.040 --> 01:12.040
<i>it gives.</i>

01:12.480 --> 01:13.754
<i>And what it costs,</i>

01:14.920 --> 01:16.399
<i>we never question.</i>

01:19.360 --> 01:22.591
One of the newest,
and yet most diligent,

01:22.680 --> 01:24.352
recruits to the Keep Fit Movement,

01:25.080 --> 01:27.469
has accomplished
something rather wonderful.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.235
Despite only starting
classes last November,

01:30.320 --> 01:32.595
and having a full-time profession,

01:33.080 --> 01:36.231
she has qualified as an
instructor in record time.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.638
Beatrix, would you like to come
forward and receive your certificate?

01:43.680 --> 01:45.238
Oh, thank you.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.920
Is there anything
you'd like to say to the class?

01:49.640 --> 01:50.709
Yes, there is.

01:51.680 --> 01:55.275
I started coming to Keep Fit at an
absolutely ghastly time in my life.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.674
It meant that for
an hour or two each week,

01:59.040 --> 02:02.396
I didn't have to think about all
the horrible and wretched things

02:02.480 --> 02:04.152
that made me so frightfully unhappy.

02:05.560 --> 02:06.560
But after a while,

02:07.560 --> 02:09.550
Keep Fit didn't just distract me,

02:10.120 --> 02:11.553
it started to make me stronger.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.394
And what's more, I've lost two
inches from around my waist,

02:15.480 --> 02:17.550
and gone up a whole cup size
in the bra department.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.310
This really is the very best thing
I have ever done.

02:21.400 --> 02:27.400
<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

02:29.240 --> 02:30.912
Oh! Good afternoon.

02:31.600 --> 02:32.720
Are you on your way to Mars?

02:32.840 --> 02:33.909
Nah. The Moon.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.080
There's no air on Mars.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.151
Oh, of course there isn't.
Silly me.

02:37.560 --> 02:39.198
Me mum wants milk of magnesia.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.793
Her name's Mrs Mullucks.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.235
Oh, yes.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.040
Hello, Perry.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.880
Your mum really needs
to come in and see Doctor,

02:46.960 --> 02:48.678
so we can give her a free prescription.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.040
But let's see what we can do.

02:58.760 --> 03:01.035
Oh! Hello, love!

03:16.800 --> 03:18.233
Oi, Perry!

03:20.880 --> 03:22.199
Mum, I got your medicine.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.153
Oh, you're a smasher.

03:25.440 --> 03:26.555
Bless you.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.278
Smile! Smile!

03:35.360 --> 03:36.509
Yay!

03:43.240 --> 03:44.309
Do hurry up.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.034
You're late for the delivery.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.951
Oh, spoilsport.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.478
Let's hope it includes
what it says it includes.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.632
I'm not sanctioning this fandangle

03:57.720 --> 04:00.837
until every button, bow
and apron string's correct.

04:01.640 --> 04:02.640
Nurse Crane,

04:03.440 --> 04:06.034
the suppliers assured
me that all is in order.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.680
The new uniform is going to
be everything we hoped for.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.680
Professional, practical,
and really rather pretty.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.516
If I might make an
observation, Sister Julienne,

04:13.760 --> 04:16.228
we are midwives, not glamour pusses.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.679
Oh, go on, I'll race you!

04:38.600 --> 04:41.717
No new look for us, Sister.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.158
Still, better 600 years
out of date than six.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.798
Yes.

04:50.480 --> 04:51.480
Goodness.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.096
These do seem to be
rather more nipped-in

04:53.120 --> 04:54.200
- than the last ones.
- Mmm.

04:54.720 --> 04:55.835
I've no complaints.

04:56.360 --> 05:00.273
It's horribly dispiriting, slaving away
to maintain a waist when no one sees it.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.480
Midwives in Scandinavia
have started wearing slacks.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.951
I read it in Nurse Crane's
<i>Journal of Nursing.</i>

05:06.040 --> 05:07.360
Imagine what bliss that would be,

05:07.400 --> 05:09.360
cycling down the dock road
at 3:00 in the morning.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.640
I don't like slacks.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.191
The tops of my thighs
are a really funny shape.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.436
Then you absolutely
must come to Keep Fit!

05:16.000 --> 05:17.880
Regular leg overs would
make all the difference.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.270
Trixie, do stop
trying to inveigle everyone

05:20.360 --> 05:21.880
to signing up for your wretched class!

05:22.400 --> 05:24.136
You'll be standing on
the Commercial Road soon,

05:24.160 --> 05:26.196
throwing shark nets over
every girl who passes by.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.397
I just think that both you
and Barbara stand to benefit.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.198
Besides, I'm terrified no one will come.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.349
Hello, Phyllis.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.792
Ooh, do you want to join
Trixie's new Keep Fit class?

05:38.880 --> 05:39.880
I do not.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.989
I am content with performing my Canadian
Air Force routine every other morning,

05:44.080 --> 05:45.433
as well you know.

05:45.800 --> 05:48.917
And I cannot make head nor tail
of these new fastenings.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.109
Come on in.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.936
You'll have to turn a blind eye
to all of us in our scanties.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.633
Oh, well, we're all
girls together, aren't we?

06:02.120 --> 06:04.509
Mum, can I do me
homework in the parlour?

06:06.160 --> 06:07.480
I just cleaned in there, Belinda.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.200
Sit at the table.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.350
Perry, move your rocket!

06:12.160 --> 06:14.799
The washing's gonna drip on my maths,
and all the sums will run.

06:15.320 --> 06:16.594
Homework in the holidays?

06:17.040 --> 06:18.040
I like homework.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.280
Still...

06:22.800 --> 06:23.800
More homework now,

06:24.600 --> 06:25.600
less housework later.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.040
Be able to get yourself
a nice job in an office.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.195
Or a bank!

06:29.840 --> 06:31.193
Mum,

06:32.040 --> 06:33.040
sit down.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.952
I've got too much to do.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.117
You all look every bit
as smart as I imagined.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.830
What I want to know is,
are those waspy belts practical?

06:51.640 --> 06:53.416
If there's one thing
midwifery's always involved

06:53.440 --> 06:55.396
it's a good deal of
bending at the midriff.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.433
One protracted birth on
a low-slung mattress,

06:58.640 --> 07:00.392
and you'll end up cut in half.

07:01.840 --> 07:05.037
Bless us, oh, Lord, and these thy gifts,
which we receive by thy bounty.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.680
- Amen.
- Amen.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.833
I was at Lisbon Buildings with
Mrs Gallagher and young Jeffrey.

07:10.280 --> 07:11.952
Is he the baby born with missing thumbs?

07:12.120 --> 07:13.792
And his mother's
no nearer getting over it

07:13.880 --> 07:15.279
than she was six weeks ago.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.954
The trouble is,
Mrs Gallagher's quite a nervy type.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.256
She was demanding sleeping pills the
moment she knew she was pregnant.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.714
I'd demand sleeping pills
if I lived at Lisbon Buildings.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.438
Surely she's on the
list to be re-housed?

07:25.720 --> 07:28.314
Everyone at Lisbon Buildings
is on the list to be re-housed.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.796
But the new flats
aren't being built fast enough.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.879
I'll talk to Dr Turner.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.996
Perhaps he can help with a medical note.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.156
Bad housing has a lot to answer for.

07:37.320 --> 07:40.039
I think you'll find family
planning has a lot to answer for.

07:40.440 --> 07:42.954
These young wives
get themselves a diaphragm,

07:43.040 --> 07:45.429
and once they can pick
and choose their family size,

07:45.520 --> 07:47.636
the picking and the choosing
never stops.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.956
They want everything just so.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.236
And if it isn't,
they don't know where to turn.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.795
I hope they know they
can turn to us, Nurse Crane.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.112
Kind words won't give
Jeffrey Gallagher his thumbs,

07:58.720 --> 08:00.551
but it may help his mother to cope.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.839
Kind words are
a universal panacea, Sister.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.993
And like you, and can dispense them
quite liberally when occasion demands.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.519
And like you, I temper
them with common sense.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.271
Would you like some bread and butter,
Nurse Crane?

08:14.600 --> 08:15.600
Thank you.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.119
I would also like the honey.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.037
As I see there is still no cake.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.994
One wonders why you
comment on its absence,

08:23.080 --> 08:25.753
given that it is our
common sacrifice for Lent.

08:26.240 --> 08:30.119
Meanwhile, Islamists
have festivals of fasting

08:30.520 --> 08:33.273
in which the frail and elderly
are not deprived.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.109
I have no objection
to our Asian neighbours,

08:36.440 --> 08:38.794
but when it comes to Lent,
we do things our way,

08:38.880 --> 08:40.029
thank you very much.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.394
- Honey, Sister?
- No.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.480
Bread and butter for me.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.320
Shh, shh.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.549
You know I don't like tulips,
I like daffs.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.976
That's all right,
I didn't bring you any, anyway.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.037
Well, they don't sell flowers
down the Hand and Shears, do they?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.956
- Huh.
- Don't come near me!

09:00.200 --> 09:01.315
Unless you want de-fleaing.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.391
What's gotten into you? Huh?

09:03.520 --> 09:05.511
You'll find out soon enough.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.440
I'm in labour.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.600
What, now?

09:10.440 --> 09:11.960
What do you think of the name Jonquil?

09:12.320 --> 09:13.320
For a boy?

09:13.440 --> 09:14.440
For a girl!

09:14.920 --> 09:16.069
It's a flower name...

09:16.160 --> 09:17.160
Like, Daffodil,

09:17.480 --> 09:18.595
only French.

09:18.680 --> 09:19.960
Well, names are your department.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.560
Yeah...

09:22.000 --> 09:23.797
And carrying bags is yours,
Bernie Mullucks.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.711
Come on, it's time to go.

09:27.320 --> 09:28.878
I can smell spring in the air.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.474
My other two are winter babies.
I haven't had a spring one.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.998
Not till this little afterthought.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.360
Little accident, more like.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.229
- Ah, we'll manage.
- Mmm.

09:39.640 --> 09:40.640
Always have.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.496
It's like we used to say
when we had to get married,

09:42.520 --> 09:43.839
and live with your mum and dad.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.400
Let's look at what we've got.

09:46.880 --> 09:47.995
Not what we've not got.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.480
Give us a kiss, Rhoda.

09:52.920 --> 09:53.920
And that's your lot.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.596
Should've said that to you
nine months ago!

10:01.280 --> 10:04.158
The neck of your womb is
what we call nicely effaced,

10:04.240 --> 10:05.389
Mrs Mullucks,

10:05.720 --> 10:08.075
so it is thinning out,
ready for the main event.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.036
However, you're only one finger dilated.

10:11.160 --> 10:13.993
The pains are terrible.
You heard me yelling just now.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.590
Seems to me, Mrs Mullucks,
that the best thing for you

10:17.680 --> 10:19.432
would be to settle down with a magazine

10:19.640 --> 10:20.640
and a nice hot drink.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.069
Have a good night's rest,

10:22.280 --> 10:23.679
then breakfast in bed on a tray.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.552
You know I'm putting
it on a bit, don't you?

10:27.280 --> 10:28.395
Two children myself.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.354
I know what it is to crave
a bit of peace and quiet.

10:32.760 --> 10:35.672
Now, <i>Woman's Realm,</i>
or are you more of a <i>Titbits</i> lady?

10:35.960 --> 10:36.960
<i>Woman's Realm.</i>

10:38.520 --> 10:41.114
They have Princess Margaret most weeks
and I love her.

10:42.280 --> 10:43.952
Especially in Norman Hartnell clothes.

10:46.720 --> 10:47.720
Can I have a cigarette?

10:48.200 --> 10:49.872
We don't encourage it on the ward.

10:51.280 --> 10:54.238
Now, I'll go and find the orderly
and get you that hot drink.

11:03.760 --> 11:04.760
Morning, Reverend.

11:04.960 --> 11:05.960
Morning, Fred.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.200
You look busy.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.391
The Jersey Royals
are coming on a treat.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.075
Half a crown deposit
secures the first crop.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.400
I'm a curate, Fred.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.317
I'm so poor,
church mice feel sorry for me.

11:27.560 --> 11:28.560
Morning, Barbara.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.435
What's all this?

11:31.080 --> 11:32.752
Oh, these are our new uniforms.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.200
New hats, too?

11:35.680 --> 11:36.680
Yes?

11:37.080 --> 11:38.832
New hats are the reason why I'm calling.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.756
Well, Easter hats,
or more precisely, bonnets.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.558
Which don't necessarily have to be new,

11:44.640 --> 11:46.517
but they do actually have to exist,

11:47.960 --> 11:49.560
or we can't have
an Easter bonnet parade.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.280
And I need help.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.677
I've left it all to
the last minute, Barbara.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.160
Please be a sport.

11:55.880 --> 11:59.270
Sister Mary Cynthia and I will
take the district list today...

11:59.360 --> 12:00.360
Sorry, mad dash.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.953
Mrs Akintola's waters just broken,

12:02.040 --> 12:03.296
she's contracting every three minutes.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.560
Um, would you see to the board?

12:04.880 --> 12:07.394
<i>- Naturellement.</i>
- And you can take the post-natal checks

12:07.480 --> 12:08.913
this morning, Nurse Franklin.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.116
And make sure you call
in on Mrs Riley...

12:11.200 --> 12:12.200
In Egerton Buildings.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.670
I think an episiotomy suture's
been left in situ, and she's very sore.

12:16.520 --> 12:17.953
Nonnatus House, midwife speaking.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.551
Ah, and Nurse Gilbert has joined us!

12:20.640 --> 12:22.232
How very kind of you to spare the time.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.920
You can accompany Nurse Franklin.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.076
Maternity home for me.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.511
Mrs Mullucks' labour
appears to be revving up.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.469
Trixie, please wait.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.718
Oh, really, Barbara.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.992
My cape keeps pulling at my neck,

12:39.080 --> 12:41.280
and I've already laddered
one of my brand-new stockings.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.512
An elegant woman wears
her clothes, they don't wear her.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.856
When you get off, you'll just have
to walk with your knees close together.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.472
Perhaps I could,

12:49.600 --> 12:50.840
colour in my leg with some ink,

12:51.160 --> 12:52.160
or a wet pencil...

12:52.240 --> 12:53.275
Excuse me, Miss.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.394
- Yes?
- Do you mind if I take your picture?

12:56.480 --> 13:00.189
Oh, that's rather a bold request
on a first acquaintance.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.755
I do have a business card.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.680
All this says is that
your name is Denny Wrey,

13:06.720 --> 13:08.278
and you're a freelance photographer.

13:08.560 --> 13:12.314
I'm trying to compile a record
of life in the old East End,

13:12.560 --> 13:13.595
before it vanishes.

13:13.680 --> 13:16.717
Well, life in the new East End
has a lot to recommend it.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.191
Little things, like vaccinations

13:19.280 --> 13:20.952
and indoor bathrooms.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.200
But you wouldn't know that,
seeing as you live in...

13:23.800 --> 13:24.800
Holland Park.

13:25.840 --> 13:26.840
Is she your boss?

13:26.960 --> 13:27.960
No.

13:28.960 --> 13:29.960
Fortunately.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.073
Miss, if I can't get
behind closed doors,

13:33.160 --> 13:35.958
I'm gonna get nothing on film,
but kids kicking footballs,

13:36.040 --> 13:37.040
and meths drinkers.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.360
And that's what
the rest of the world will see.

13:40.600 --> 13:41.600
He's right, Trixie.

13:43.360 --> 13:44.360
Do you have a bike?

13:44.600 --> 13:45.600
I have a scooter.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.040
Very well.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.436
As long as you don't
inconvenience our patients,

13:50.800 --> 13:52.870
I see no reason
why you can't tag along.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.039
Do you know any gangsters?

13:55.280 --> 13:58.397
That's for us to know,
and for you to find out.

14:15.560 --> 14:16.560
Swap around.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.718
They're sending men into space,

14:25.800 --> 14:28.075
you'd think they'd find
a way round this by now.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.520
We'll have another try with the gas
with your next pain.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.959
I feel a right chump,
with my bum stuck in the air.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.711
Believe me, Rhoda,
I've seen it all before.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.155
I was hoping for a nun,
not one of you young 'uns.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.230
Bet you've all got lovely bleeding bums.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
There we go.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.640
All right?

15:00.720 --> 15:01.835
Good girl, Rhoda.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.119
Rhoda...

15:16.760 --> 15:18.400
Baby's got himself
into a bit of a pickle,

15:18.640 --> 15:20.200
so we're going to have to help him out.

15:20.680 --> 15:21.954
How do you mean, a pickle?

15:22.520 --> 15:24.715
His head seems to be a bit off-centre,

15:24.920 --> 15:26.990
it's nothing we can't sort
out between ourselves,

15:27.080 --> 15:29.071
but you are going to
have to change position.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.316
I can't.

15:32.240 --> 15:33.240
I'm too tired.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.671
Doctor's still on his rounds,
but he called

15:36.760 --> 15:38.352
and asked me to check on Mrs Mullucks.

15:38.440 --> 15:39.634
Perfect timing, Mrs Turner.

15:39.920 --> 15:42.070
Rhoda and I
need a hand with our gymnastics.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.953
Keep it coming.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.393
Keep it coming.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.558
Glorious work, glorious.

15:48.800 --> 15:49.800
We're crowning!

15:49.880 --> 15:50.880
There you are,

15:50.960 --> 15:52.359
Rhoda, well done.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.509
Oh, we have a head!

15:55.840 --> 15:57.637
And that, Rhoda Mullucks,

15:57.800 --> 15:59.360
is why women ought to run this country.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.119
Can I lie down now?

16:02.200 --> 16:03.235
In a minute or two.

16:03.440 --> 16:04.680
Just catch your breath for now.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.189
What is it?

16:17.280 --> 16:18.508
A boy or a girl?

16:19.360 --> 16:21.430
I don't mind,
I've got one of each.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.189
It's a daughter.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.435
Mrs Turner, will you give Baby a rub?

16:47.720 --> 16:49.680
We've a bit of a Speedy Gonzales
of an afterbirth.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.999
There you go.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.479
I'll just fit that over,
if it's all in order, then we're done.

17:05.359 --> 17:06.679
Come on, little one.

17:07.319 --> 17:08.833
Mummy's waiting to meet you.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.990
Bring her over, I want to look at her.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.753
Baby's a bit chilly, Rhoda.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.712
I'm going to pop
to the nursery with her,

17:39.120 --> 17:41.475
and just put her under the heat lamp
for a minute or two.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.240
Oh, Patrick.

17:49.440 --> 17:50.759
Has Rhoda Mullucks delivered?

17:51.360 --> 17:52.360
A little girl.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.474
She can't live.

18:04.440 --> 18:05.440
She can't.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.833
A malformation like this
can't only be external.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.360
What about the mother?

18:13.600 --> 18:14.828
Did she see the baby?

18:15.080 --> 18:16.080
No.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.597
I should've just let her slip away.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.720
Shelagh.

18:22.440 --> 18:23.839
She's limbless, Patrick.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.549
You said yourself, she's probably
just as damaged on the inside.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.273
Who knows how much she'll suffer.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.271
Even if she only lives an hour.

18:48.520 --> 18:49.520
Come in.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
I made you some tea.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.830
Sister Monica Joan
wanted to bring it up,

18:57.920 --> 18:59.416
but there's a Gypsy Cream in the saucer

18:59.440 --> 19:01.271
and I was afraid it
might not stay the course.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.400
You heard about the Mullucks' baby,
then?

19:09.240 --> 19:10.240
Is it very bad?

19:11.200 --> 19:12.235
It was ghastly.

19:15.400 --> 19:18.198
Trixie wondered if you
were still going to Keep Fit.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.240
Oh, Lord.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.391
Should I tell her
you're not feeling up to it?

19:23.120 --> 19:24.120
No.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.161
I think this is one of those
occasions where one has to...

19:27.240 --> 19:28.912
Buck up and knuckle down.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.510
If we can retrieve even half a dozen

19:33.600 --> 19:34.919
potential bonnets from this lot,

19:35.160 --> 19:38.040
then we can throw ourselves at the mercy
of the crepe paper for the rest.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.760
Oh!

19:41.600 --> 19:42.600
Perfect.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.056
You really are a wonderful person
to have on your side

19:45.080 --> 19:46.080
when the chips are down.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.195
And the very best thing of all
is you've not once said,

19:50.280 --> 19:52.440
"Why can't the children make
their own Easter bonnets?"

19:52.520 --> 19:53.600
Well, they can't, can they?

19:54.080 --> 19:55.308
Or, at least, some could.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.560
But some would be left out,
because money is tight,

19:57.800 --> 19:59.472
or things aren't right at home.

19:59.640 --> 20:00.640
Oh, hello, you two.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.399
Trixie. Patsy.

20:03.480 --> 20:06.096
Have you come to do a bit of knees
bent, arms stretched, rah, rah, rah?

20:06.120 --> 20:07.155
What?

20:07.240 --> 20:09.196
It's my inaugural
Keep Fit class tonight.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.317
Barbara, I brought you
a leotard and tights.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.557
Oh, I was just going to wear
my gym skirt.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.672
Oh, Barbara, please don't start
that nonsense about your thighs!

20:16.760 --> 20:18.398
Denny's here to take photographs.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.536
And we'll look much more stylish
if we're wearing matching outfits,

20:21.560 --> 20:24.074
so say goodbye to Tom
and go and get changed.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.672
You look as fresh as a daisy.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.833
It's amazing what a sponge down
and a nice nap can do.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.990
Can I have my little girl with me
for visiting time?

20:32.080 --> 20:33.433
I want to show her to her dad.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.400
Baby's to stay in the nursery
for tonight.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.674
She had a rather rough ride of it,
just like you.

20:46.480 --> 20:49.711
And we will begin the class
with some gentle exercises,

20:49.800 --> 20:51.711
designed to loosen our muscles.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.274
So, stand up straight,

20:54.240 --> 20:57.596
knees slightly flexed,
and a hand's width apart...

20:57.680 --> 20:59.955
Oh! I'm doing smashing so far!

21:00.040 --> 21:02.395
And now we're going to turn our head,

21:02.480 --> 21:04.232
from left to right.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.639
Like so.

21:10.160 --> 21:13.470
If you feel inspired,
you can do it in time to the music.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.276
But it is a bossa nova beat,

21:17.640 --> 21:20.074
so don't panic if you can't keep up.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.238
Oh, I'm not so sure
about this one!

21:29.680 --> 21:33.195
I spoke to a registrar
at the Children's Hospital.

21:33.560 --> 21:37.758
He says it sounds like a very,
very rare condition called phocomelia.

21:38.480 --> 21:39.879
It means "seal limbed".

21:40.800 --> 21:43.075
But, what could cause it?
Why would it happen?

21:43.520 --> 21:46.432
He said usually the best way
to explain it to the parents

21:46.640 --> 21:48.835
is to say that Mother Nature
made a mistake.

21:49.440 --> 21:53.672
I once said that to a mum whose baby
had a huge port wine mark on her face.

21:54.360 --> 21:57.113
She said, "In which case,
Mother Nature must be a right old..."

21:58.320 --> 22:01.437
I'm not going to repeat the word,
but it was uncomplimentary,

22:02.880 --> 22:04.438
and possibly accurate.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.354
The registrar said that
if she survived the night,

22:07.440 --> 22:09.032
they could find a bed for her,

22:10.560 --> 22:12.357
but that survival wasn't likely.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.552
She's breathing steadily enough,

22:16.280 --> 22:18.191
but I can't interest her in feeding.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.557
The registrar said not to force her.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.590
There might be pathologies of the gut.

22:24.280 --> 22:26.032
He said to keep her comfortable,

22:26.120 --> 22:29.510
and watch for a gradual tapering off
of vital signs.

22:30.520 --> 22:33.398
- She mustn't suffer. She mustn't.
- Shelagh.

22:34.760 --> 22:37.228
Go home. To our own children.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.718
Don't get involved with this.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.799
Shh.

24:02.320 --> 24:05.198
There's no mistaking what you want,
is there, young lady?

24:06.440 --> 24:07.998
"Over the past decade,"

24:09.080 --> 24:11.310
"hyperparathyroidism"

24:11.640 --> 24:15.633
"has been recognised
as a fairly common disease,"

24:16.800 --> 24:20.839
"especially amongst patients
with renal calculi."

24:22.520 --> 24:25.114
Who's getting involved now, Patrick?

24:26.520 --> 24:27.589
She is.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.713
She wants to live.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.160
Oh, I hardly slept a wink last night.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.793
I don't know how you manage,

24:42.920 --> 24:45.480
going to bed with a head
full of ironmongery night after night.

24:46.040 --> 24:47.837
One must suffer to be beautiful.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.511
Do you have any special plans
for your day off?

24:51.640 --> 24:52.993
No, I'm just meeting a friend.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.550
My husband never
came in last night.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.599
I fell asleep.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.438
When I woke up, gone 11:00!

25:11.800 --> 25:14.633
- Too late.
- He does know Baby's been born.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.111
Mrs Turner telephoned him
at the warehouse.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.436
Oh, that's nice of her.

25:21.200 --> 25:24.351
Expect he's already down at the Hand
and Shears, wetting the baby's head.

25:24.560 --> 25:28.235
Yes, and you needed to rest, Rhoda.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.793
Why are you calling me Rhoda?

25:31.240 --> 25:33.959
I thought it was formal terms
on a ward, just like the clinic.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.709
Sorry,
I didn't mean to sound disrespectful.

25:36.840 --> 25:39.912
You don't. You sound kind,
like there's something wrong.

25:40.920 --> 25:42.797
They said I could hold her this morning.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.152
Baby had a very good night.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.918
- I'm sure you'll see her soon.
- Oh, ta.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.080
Mmm.

25:56.520 --> 25:57.748
I spoke to the Children's,

25:58.360 --> 26:00.794
they said to send her in for assessment.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.471
The ambulance is booked for 2:00.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.190
Patrick, her mother
has to see her first.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.028
I know she does.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.717
There. You have a nice little sleep.

26:31.480 --> 26:32.674
I'll be back soon.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.594
Oh, Mr Mullucks!

26:42.000 --> 26:44.230
Is there any chance of me seeing
my missus and my kid?

26:44.640 --> 26:46.870
It's just, I got a bit
tied up last night, so...

26:47.520 --> 26:48.919
Why don't you take a seat?

26:49.040 --> 26:51.713
I'll pop through and see
if your wife's ready for visitors.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.433
Would you like a cigarette, Rhoda?

27:13.160 --> 27:14.160
What, in here?

27:15.960 --> 27:17.837
I will if you will.

27:35.440 --> 27:36.509
Excuse me.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.832
As you know, Rhoda,

27:49.040 --> 27:51.998
your baby needed a bit of extra care
when she first arrived.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.715
But the little nun
says she's doing all right now.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.632
She is doing all right now.

27:58.920 --> 28:02.515
It seems she had some problems
when she was still in the womb.

28:20.160 --> 28:23.436
She has the most beautiful,
beautiful face.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.074
Has she?

28:26.560 --> 28:28.312
It's just that she...

28:29.600 --> 28:32.478
Seems not to have grown
quite as she should.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.160
Hello.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.159
Are you saying she's a dwarf?

28:56.760 --> 28:57.954
No.

29:10.160 --> 29:12.151
Shh, shh, shh...

29:14.640 --> 29:15.675
Hello.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.835
- Mr Mullucks.
- How could you even let that live?

29:37.720 --> 29:40.473
I need to see her.
I need to see her!

29:40.920 --> 29:42.592
You will, Rhoda.

29:42.720 --> 29:47.032
I'm going to fetch her myself, bring her
to you and put her in your arms.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.636
Everything else,
we can talk about later.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.756
There ain't nothing to talk about,
do you hear me?

29:51.840 --> 29:53.876
Nothing. 'Cause I've seen it.

29:54.520 --> 29:57.796
And there ain't no way that thing
is coming back to our house.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.638
It's all right, Rhoda.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.230
We're with you every step of the way.

30:37.560 --> 30:38.993
Come on in, Rhoda.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.556
Sit down and I'll hand Baby to you.

30:52.360 --> 30:54.696
I'll pop out and get you a cushion
if that chair's too hard.

30:54.720 --> 30:55.789
It isn't.

31:03.840 --> 31:07.150
She smells like my others.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.516
Can I just be by myself with her?

31:11.760 --> 31:13.478
We'll be right outside the door.

31:45.240 --> 31:46.639
Oh, love.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.673
Oh, what a mess.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.071
What a mess, eh?

32:04.200 --> 32:06.077
We'll sort something out.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.272
I promise.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.393
'Cause you're mine.

32:13.480 --> 32:14.595
Mine.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.910
And I'm not bailing out on you.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.075
Pats?

32:35.120 --> 32:36.633
Were you looking at your watch?

32:36.840 --> 32:38.319
- No.
- Fibber.

32:40.320 --> 32:41.840
I was given a spotless bill of health,

32:42.520 --> 32:43.953
and went straight to see Matron.

32:44.400 --> 32:48.188
I walked into that hospital a patient,
and walked back out an employee.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.073
Mr Mullucks!

32:58.240 --> 32:59.434
Mr Mullucks!

33:00.240 --> 33:03.232
Your daughter
is going to be admitted to hospital.

33:04.680 --> 33:07.513
Mr Mullucks!

33:27.800 --> 33:28.915
Rhoda?

33:30.280 --> 33:32.919
Mrs Turner's just gone to see
to some paperwork.

33:33.520 --> 33:36.318
She wondered if you'd like
to give baby a name?

33:38.720 --> 33:41.001
She can fill out the forms without one,
it doesn't matter.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.349
No, it does matter.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.111
I gave my other kids fancy names.

33:45.840 --> 33:46.989
Belinda Louise.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.360
Perry Keith.

33:49.080 --> 33:52.834
I had a fancy name.
Made me stand out, it was great.

33:55.240 --> 33:56.593
I'm gonna call her Susan.

33:58.360 --> 34:01.557
She'll never have to spell it
or explain it.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.079
There'll be nothing said by anyone.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.838
She might be glad of that.

34:09.120 --> 34:12.192
The only fly in the ointment
is having to wait until June.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.320
But unless Staff Nurse Winters
gets knocked up

34:15.400 --> 34:18.358
and brings her wedding forward,
we'll just have to bide our time.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.237
It still seems
too good to be true.

34:21.440 --> 34:22.440
There you are!

34:23.880 --> 34:27.429
That's a right wild goose chase you sent
me on to that foundation garment shop!

34:28.800 --> 34:32.076
They don't stock
Miss Mary of Switzerland girdles at all!

34:32.560 --> 34:34.072
Hello, Mum.

34:34.320 --> 34:36.197
You remember Patsy, don't you?

34:36.280 --> 34:38.714
Of course I do.
Nice to see you again, dear.

34:42.159 --> 34:43.275
There's scum on that tea.

34:43.960 --> 34:45.360
Wouldn't see that in Pembrokeshire.

34:46.239 --> 34:48.389
I was just telling Patsy my news, Mum.

34:48.840 --> 34:50.159
It's wonderful, isn't it?

34:50.280 --> 34:52.199
Well, I'm glad she's recovered
from her accident.

34:53.239 --> 34:55.629
But I don't want her
coming back to London, or to work.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.071
- Mum?
- Don't you "Mum" me, I'm your mother.

34:58.560 --> 35:01.120
Every time I walk through
those hospital doors, I feel ill.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.656
I go right back to you lying there,
with your head cracked open

35:03.680 --> 35:06.274
- and your mind half gone.
- That was six months ago!

35:06.720 --> 35:09.188
- Delia's made a complete recovery!
- I haven't.

35:09.600 --> 35:10.600
Neither has her dad.

35:11.880 --> 35:14.155
We don't want her
leaving home again, ever.

35:15.440 --> 35:18.016
Besides, they've even knocked
the nurses' home down at the London,

35:18.040 --> 35:19.120
she'd have nowhere to live.

35:19.440 --> 35:22.034
- Lots of nurses live in rented digs.
- Digs?

35:22.640 --> 35:25.473
Digs? She can't be fending for herself
like that, she gets tired!

35:25.560 --> 35:27.835
I'm sorry, <i>cariad,</i>
I'm putting my foot down.

35:36.520 --> 35:37.919
<i>You're not taking her!</i>

35:38.080 --> 35:40.355
Not to hospital,
not to anywhere out of my sight!

35:40.440 --> 35:41.720
What are they gonna do with her?

35:42.000 --> 35:44.753
Dump her in a corner, shut her
in some side room like you have?

35:45.120 --> 35:47.759
Rhoda, Baby's received
the very best of care here.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.194
Her name is Susan.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.915
And if that's true, why can't she stay?

35:52.400 --> 35:53.469
Why can't she stay?

35:53.560 --> 35:55.630
They may be able
to do tests on her in hospital.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.278
What sort of tests?

35:57.640 --> 35:59.312
Tests to make her arms grow?

35:59.400 --> 36:01.595
Tests that magic her legs
out of nowhere?

36:02.280 --> 36:03.280
No.

36:04.320 --> 36:07.039
Come on. Doctor prescribed this for you.

36:07.160 --> 36:08.559
Oh.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.596
What is it?

36:12.920 --> 36:14.638
Just something to help you settle down.

36:23.320 --> 36:25.436
Will there be a test
that can tell us why?

36:26.320 --> 36:28.117
I'm afraid that's not likely, Rhoda.

36:28.200 --> 36:29.519
Then she ain't going!

36:30.120 --> 36:31.951
And I ain't signing any forms!

36:35.280 --> 36:37.077
When Nurse Crane gets back tonight,

36:37.160 --> 36:40.072
I'm asking her to look at the roster
for Easter weekend.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.959
We need extra time for our devotions,

36:44.680 --> 36:46.477
and there are several babies due.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.719
I'm afraid the younger generation
will need to step up to the plate.

36:50.040 --> 36:51.314
That's all right, Sister.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.673
I'll arrange for an extra-special lunch
for Easter Monday.

36:55.360 --> 36:56.679
Before the Bonnet Parade.

36:57.760 --> 36:59.113
Shall I invite Mr Hereward?

37:00.760 --> 37:01.760
Why not?

37:09.720 --> 37:10.994
Morning, Sister.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.680
- Smashing article in the paper.
- What's that, then?

37:19.440 --> 37:22.159
- Right, Nurse Franklin!
- Present and correct.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.912
There's nothing whatever correct
about this, Nurse Franklin.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.591
- Oh.
- What is it?

37:29.680 --> 37:31.830
I would rather you didn't look,
Sister Julienne,

37:31.920 --> 37:34.115
but I'm happy to spell out
the headlines for you.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.077
"Keeping Fit", exclamation mark.

37:37.440 --> 37:40.637
"Poplar Midwives Take Care
of All Aspects of Health."

37:40.920 --> 37:44.833
Two photographs of Nurse Gilbert
and Nurse Mount in their new uniforms,

37:44.920 --> 37:47.309
and then two photographs of all of them

37:47.480 --> 37:50.199
cavorting in their combinations!

37:50.920 --> 37:54.117
Those aren't combinations, Sister,
they're called leotards.

37:54.760 --> 37:55.760
Oh, Trixie!

37:56.200 --> 37:58.156
We aren't in the paper in our leotards!

37:58.240 --> 38:00.071
I'm afraid you are, Nurse Gilbert.

38:00.560 --> 38:03.552
Showing every outline that God gave you!

38:04.640 --> 38:06.278
If God gave us those outlines, Sister,

38:06.720 --> 38:09.154
then I'm sure he won't object to them
being on display.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.951
But, Nurse Franklin,
I'm very much afraid we do.

38:17.680 --> 38:20.069
The problem is,
the nappies are just too big.

38:20.520 --> 38:23.830
On a normal baby, the towelling
comes halfway down the thighs,

38:23.920 --> 38:26.229
but Susan's feet keep getting caught.

38:26.680 --> 38:30.559
Could we try, uh, cutting one up
and hemming it? See if that works.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.680
I'd like to put her
in little nighties, too.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.751
Not just vests all the time.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.869
Could someone bring in some baby clothes
from home for you?

38:39.120 --> 38:41.350
We could experiment and see what works.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.032
My husband won't come in and, um,

38:43.880 --> 38:45.916
the rest of the family's
in Canvey Island, and...

38:46.240 --> 38:48.390
God knows what he's told them.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.200
I suppose we're out of sight,
out of mind?

38:50.360 --> 38:53.193
Rhoda, in a few days,
when you go home...

38:53.280 --> 38:54.918
We can't go home!

38:55.920 --> 38:57.717
He won't have her in the house, and...

38:58.880 --> 39:00.438
I'm not putting her in a home.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.314
She's mine.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.676
I won't bow down to them, I won't!

39:09.760 --> 39:13.275
I'd mind less if we weren't spending all
weekend on duty so that they could pray.

39:13.360 --> 39:16.352
Hurry up, Babs. We're breaking rank
and getting our own tea tonight.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.879
I suppose we ought to stoke up

39:17.960 --> 39:20.235
if we're going to go out
"cavorting in our combinations".

39:22.160 --> 39:24.310
Do you want to join us,
Sister Monica Joan?

39:25.240 --> 39:27.879
I am engaged in watching television.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.630
I await the news, so I might decide
which cataclysm to pray for.

39:35.920 --> 39:38.514
- Éclairs?
- Four. It was two for half a crown.

39:39.560 --> 39:40.560
- Gosh.
- Oh!

39:41.800 --> 39:45.554
You break your Lenten fast!
Yet it is only Maundy Thursday,

39:45.640 --> 39:48.791
and too soon to cease the deprivations
of the flesh.

39:49.800 --> 39:52.553
Jesus didn't deprive his flesh
on Maundy Thursday.

39:52.960 --> 39:56.509
He sat with his disciples
and broke bread at the Last Supper.

39:56.640 --> 39:59.200
And I believe,
in Eastern Orthodox tradition,

39:59.440 --> 40:01.158
Lent actually ends today.

40:03.640 --> 40:04.993
When I was a child,

40:05.400 --> 40:08.676
my nurse would never let me eat
every morsel put before me.

40:09.280 --> 40:11.794
Something must always
remain for Mr Manners.

40:12.640 --> 40:15.234
I know now that Mr Manners is a myth,

40:15.640 --> 40:19.269
and it is madness to appease him
with delights of any kind.

40:28.440 --> 40:31.238
And now we take our right arm
and raise it upright.

40:31.880 --> 40:34.599
Moving it backwards,
we perform a circle.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.875
Repeating the move four times.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.477
And then we switch to the left side
and do the same again.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.470
Gives the Windmill Girls
a whole new meaning.

40:50.200 --> 40:52.839
It's certainly very stimulating
to the humours.

40:53.320 --> 40:56.118
And remember, feet 12 inches apart.

40:56.480 --> 41:00.632
Now we reverse the action,
moving the right arm forwards.

41:03.120 --> 41:05.315
Good job I swirled
under me arms this morning!

41:08.480 --> 41:11.790
But if Rhoda's husband
won't let her take Susan home,

41:11.880 --> 41:14.917
and she won't put her in an institution,
where will they go?

41:16.400 --> 41:19.198
There has been talk of finding
her a room in a hostel,

41:19.280 --> 41:22.431
where she could take the baby, but
she has two other children to consider.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.032
It's not going to be easy.

41:25.280 --> 41:26.280
No.

41:27.320 --> 41:29.038
But things might resolve.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.150
The situation doesn't
have to be impossible.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.676
Seems fairly impossible to me.

41:38.640 --> 41:41.393
I had a little brother
born with water on the brain.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.272
Oh, I had no idea.

41:44.320 --> 41:46.595
We aren't encouraged
to talk about personal things.

41:49.560 --> 41:51.391
My mother wouldn't put him in a home.

41:53.040 --> 41:54.917
When we took him out she'd say,

41:55.200 --> 41:57.236
"If people stare, stare back."

41:58.640 --> 42:00.596
And I never could, because...

42:00.960 --> 42:04.270
After they'd stared, they'd turn
away and shake their heads.

42:05.720 --> 42:08.712
And when they did that,
I could see him through their eyes.

42:09.680 --> 42:11.318
But we knew we loved him.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.514
He died.

42:16.280 --> 42:17.713
A long time ago.

42:19.800 --> 42:22.712
And that was when we realised
how much he'd really mattered.

42:23.400 --> 42:25.960
God bless you, Sister.

42:26.160 --> 42:27.160
And him.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.480
Thank you.

42:34.640 --> 42:38.428
I just wonder if it's not
something in the atmosphere.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.440
The father of the baby
with the missing thumbs

42:41.880 --> 42:44.235
is a chemical mixer at the matchworks.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.870
There are atom bombs
going off in the Sahara

42:47.080 --> 42:49.096
and a polluted river running
right past our front door.

42:49.120 --> 42:51.998
I'm not sure any good
can come of asking why, Sister.

42:52.320 --> 42:56.154
We have to accept
things are as they are and...

42:57.280 --> 42:59.794
Reach out with all the love we can find.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.597
I suppose that's what we're doing now,

43:03.400 --> 43:04.594
with Susan's clothes.

43:05.840 --> 43:08.434
The trouble is,
these aren't Susan's clothes.

43:08.520 --> 43:10.511
They're what we could find
in the charity box,

43:10.720 --> 43:15.077
things people threw away,
and that just isn't good enough.

43:27.920 --> 43:31.310
I do know it must be hard for you
to manage without Rhoda, Mr Mullucks.

43:32.480 --> 43:34.596
She's such a wonderful wife and mother.

43:34.920 --> 43:36.400
She's not bringing that monster home.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.072
I know Susan's deformities
are shocking at first glance.

43:41.200 --> 43:42.200
At first glance?

43:42.760 --> 43:44.352
Are you saying I didn't see what I saw?

43:46.680 --> 43:47.680
No.

43:50.680 --> 43:52.238
First glances are for strangers,

43:53.760 --> 43:57.799
and shock is just for passers-by,
for people who don't know Susan,

43:58.360 --> 43:59.634
or love her.

44:00.480 --> 44:01.595
But if you bring her home,

44:01.840 --> 44:03.480
and bring her up
with your other children,

44:03.520 --> 44:05.590
she'll become as familiar

44:06.440 --> 44:08.715
and as beautiful to you as they are.

44:09.160 --> 44:10.559
And what makes you such an expert?

44:11.680 --> 44:12.954
I'm not.

44:14.280 --> 44:16.396
This sort of situation, nobody ever is.

44:18.040 --> 44:20.793
But Rhoda loves Susan and I believe,

44:21.080 --> 44:23.514
I know, that you love Rhoda.

44:26.400 --> 44:28.000
These are the things that Mum got ready.

44:28.360 --> 44:29.634
Well done, Belinda.

44:29.840 --> 44:31.956
I left some things upstairs
because they are blue.

44:32.400 --> 44:33.440
Mum got all colours ready.

44:33.560 --> 44:35.376
She said, "You never know
what you're going to get."

44:35.400 --> 44:36.400
Ain't that the truth?

44:38.480 --> 44:39.879
I wish we could see her.

44:44.160 --> 44:46.833
It'll be a challenge, Mr Mullucks,
whatever you choose to do.

44:47.560 --> 44:50.518
But it'll all be so much harder
if the family's pulled apart.

44:58.080 --> 44:59.752
Now we've finished our tea and biscuits,

44:59.880 --> 45:02.633
we're going to move on to
a more challenging exercise,

45:02.920 --> 45:05.593
where we work our arms
and legs together,

45:06.120 --> 45:08.998
trimming our flanks
and tightening our upper bust.

45:09.760 --> 45:12.200
It's a case of "good luck with that",
as far as I'm concerned!

45:13.160 --> 45:14.229
Sister Monica Joan,

45:14.480 --> 45:16.311
you can do these moves
in a seated position.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.669
She's such a slave driver.

45:19.760 --> 45:20.875
No talking, please!

45:20.960 --> 45:23.315
We need to save our breath
for our exercises.

45:23.600 --> 45:24.600
Just follow me!

45:25.280 --> 45:27.714
Hands to the cleavage
then out horizontally.

45:28.120 --> 45:31.271
Hands to the cleavage
then out horizontally.

45:31.560 --> 45:33.039
Then we add a marching step.

45:39.080 --> 45:40.080
Knees high!

45:42.640 --> 45:43.640
Oh!

45:51.680 --> 45:53.033
Carry on, ladies.

45:57.520 --> 45:59.238
Olive, is everything all right?

45:59.880 --> 46:02.599
If you've injured yourself,
I'll need to put it in my report book.

46:02.920 --> 46:03.920
No, don't.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.399
Please, please don't.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.119
I've had an accident.

46:11.760 --> 46:13.120
Oh, it's not the end of the world.

46:13.400 --> 46:14.799
It was that exercise.

46:15.880 --> 46:17.154
My clothes are soaked.

46:18.080 --> 46:22.232
Would you, erm, fetch me mac for me,
so's I can go out through the hall?

46:22.640 --> 46:23.959
Of course.

46:25.520 --> 46:27.317
Has this happened to you before?

46:28.080 --> 46:31.152
Well, it does, doesn't it, to women?

46:31.560 --> 46:32.675
Not necessarily.

46:33.520 --> 46:35.112
Not unless there's something wrong.

46:35.480 --> 46:36.879
I reckon there is something wrong.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.551
It's like there's something
slipping away, down below.

46:42.840 --> 46:45.229
Oh, Olive, you must see the doctor!

46:45.480 --> 46:48.711
He'll just say I've had seven kids,
it's par for the course.

46:49.200 --> 46:51.794
Besides, I manage.

46:51.880 --> 46:53.199
There's things you can do.

46:53.640 --> 46:55.756
And they obviously
aren't working, are they?

47:03.800 --> 47:05.995
Good evening, ladies,
and Sister Monica Joan.

47:06.400 --> 47:08.072
You're just in time for Compline.

47:08.280 --> 47:11.158
You were all greatly missed at high tea.

47:11.600 --> 47:15.070
We had to eat early so that we could
make it on time for my Keep Fit class.

47:15.960 --> 47:16.960
All of you?

47:17.280 --> 47:18.713
Yes, Sister, all of us.

47:19.200 --> 47:20.235
I can assure you,

47:20.520 --> 47:23.751
I have not in any way
contravened our Lenten vow.

47:24.320 --> 47:26.709
I have consumed only potato chips

47:27.000 --> 47:28.911
and they are savoury, not sweet.

47:30.560 --> 47:34.439
Nurse Franklin, will you please come
to my office at 9:00 tomorrow morning?

47:35.000 --> 47:37.878
I shall be otherwise engaged at 9:00.
I shall come at 9:30.

47:52.280 --> 47:54.874
I wanted to make something
special for Belinda Mullucks.

47:55.160 --> 47:57.879
I thought she needed to know
that someone was looking out for her.

47:58.400 --> 48:00.595
What about young fellow-me-lad, the son?

48:00.840 --> 48:01.840
Perry.

48:02.760 --> 48:04.990
Tom's making him an aerial
for his space helmet.

48:05.840 --> 48:07.360
He's actually quite good at metalwork.

48:07.760 --> 48:10.274
I'll get it.

48:10.360 --> 48:11.998
Do not remove them.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.840
The entire creation
is hanging in the balance.

48:18.760 --> 48:19.909
<i>I'm sorry, Pats.</i>

48:21.600 --> 48:22.600
I'm so sorry.

48:23.360 --> 48:24.713
Delia, you're 24.

48:25.640 --> 48:27.096
When I said that to my mother,
she said,

48:27.120 --> 48:29.839
"And it's only by
the grace of God you'll see 25."

48:31.320 --> 48:33.880
If I come back to live in London
it will break her.

48:35.200 --> 48:38.590
<i>I owe her so much
and she's fighting so hard.</i>

48:40.680 --> 48:42.193
Well, can I see you before you go?

48:45.040 --> 48:46.996
We're getting the bus
back home on Monday night.

48:50.080 --> 48:51.798
Can I meet you for lunch?

48:52.840 --> 48:56.071
You could come here, I know everyone
would be so pleased to see you.

48:57.280 --> 48:58.280
All right.

49:00.120 --> 49:01.951
But I can't leave Mum.

49:09.920 --> 49:10.920
Morning, Rhoda.

49:11.680 --> 49:13.671
We had quite a sewing bee last night.

49:14.520 --> 49:17.671
I've brought some nappies
and dresses to try on Susan.

49:18.400 --> 49:19.833
Oh...

49:30.280 --> 49:34.717
Well, look at all this,
Susan Mullucks. Eh?

49:37.320 --> 49:39.629
Norman Hartnell better watch his back.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.440
She's going to be
a right little head-turner.

49:45.160 --> 49:46.160
Yes.

49:50.880 --> 49:52.711
It's just as well he's not a young man,

49:52.880 --> 49:54.757
I wouldn't know where to put me face.

49:54.960 --> 49:57.520
Doctor's not embarrassed, Olive,
nor should you be.

49:58.400 --> 50:00.152
I'm glad you came in, Mrs Nattrass.

50:00.960 --> 50:03.679
You have what we call
a prolapse of the womb.

50:04.400 --> 50:06.470
It's advanced enough
to mean that your womb

50:06.560 --> 50:09.358
is periodically slipping
down through your vagina.

50:10.200 --> 50:12.031
Is that the medical word for it?

50:12.160 --> 50:13.160
Vagina.

50:15.240 --> 50:16.753
I never heard that said before.

50:17.320 --> 50:19.856
Even when I was having me nippers,
we just used to call everything

50:19.880 --> 50:21.472
our "down-belows".

50:21.920 --> 50:23.876
The nuns never used
to call it anything at all.

50:24.640 --> 50:26.392
Have you ever tried
to remedy this yourself?

50:27.920 --> 50:29.273
Well, I, I tried...

50:30.360 --> 50:32.351
I tried shoving things up there.

50:33.920 --> 50:38.072
Er, me mum, she used to say she'd
tie a knot in a bit of old flannel.

50:38.560 --> 50:40.039
I've had a go at that.

50:41.120 --> 50:44.430
I've heard of people using
a bit of rolled-up cardboard.

50:45.720 --> 50:48.393
Even apples, some of them, or a spud.

50:49.320 --> 50:50.320
So have I.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.896
But you have to draw
the line somewhere, don't you?

50:52.920 --> 50:54.319
Yes, you do.

50:54.600 --> 50:57.160
And I am drawing a line
under this right now

50:57.240 --> 50:59.356
and referring you for surgical repair.

51:00.440 --> 51:01.998
Will that be on the National Health?

51:02.080 --> 51:03.832
Everything's on
the National Health now.

51:04.320 --> 51:05.719
Has been for quite a long time.

51:06.600 --> 51:08.272
All you had to do was ask, Olive.

51:09.080 --> 51:10.308
Never had the words, did I?

51:11.480 --> 51:12.480
No.

51:17.880 --> 51:21.156
Daffs, tulips, iris. Fresh for Easter!

51:21.240 --> 51:24.118
You should get some flowers, Dad.
She likes daffodils.

51:28.160 --> 51:32.472
We have a particular way of doing things
at Nonnatus House, Nurse Franklin,

51:33.320 --> 51:34.833
and we've found over the years

51:35.120 --> 51:38.908
that everything's much more harmonious
if those who live with us respect that.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.392
But, Sister Julienne,

51:41.680 --> 51:45.389
there's a difference between respect
and living by your rules.

51:45.880 --> 51:47.598
We're nurses, not nuns.

51:48.040 --> 51:52.158
We're nurses too, so in that respect
our vocations overlap.

51:53.160 --> 51:55.116
But if you make social arrangements

51:55.200 --> 51:59.193
that take half our team off the roster
at the same time every week,

52:00.040 --> 52:01.951
then our patients may suffer.

52:02.400 --> 52:07.076
And we have yet to address the business
of those disappointing photographs.

52:08.440 --> 52:10.158
I'm not giving up Keep Fit.

52:11.440 --> 52:15.877
You already take one evening off
each week to attend your other class.

52:16.280 --> 52:17.508
Sister,

52:17.600 --> 52:21.229
Alcoholics Anonymous,
and I'm not afraid to say the name,

52:21.720 --> 52:24.632
isn't my "other class",
it's the thing that saved me.

52:26.160 --> 52:28.355
And Keep Fit is the thing
that makes me whole.

52:30.160 --> 52:33.516
I do see how well you look,
and how happy.

52:35.880 --> 52:38.235
And I'm not just doing
Keep Fit for myself.

52:39.160 --> 52:42.914
There are women in my group who can't
even name parts of their own anatomy.

52:43.600 --> 52:46.160
They expect to be in discomfort,
even pain,

52:46.560 --> 52:50.553
because they haven't been taught that
owning a female body ought to be a joy.

52:51.160 --> 52:53.196
But it so often isn't, Nurse Franklin.

52:53.960 --> 52:56.918
- That's what our work's about.
- And it shouldn't have to be!

52:58.120 --> 53:00.236
This morning I spent time
with a patient who,

53:00.400 --> 53:03.790
with all due respect
is nearer your generation than mine.

53:04.200 --> 53:07.237
And her experience isn't one
that we need to see repeated.

53:11.240 --> 53:12.240
I'm sorry, Sister.

53:13.240 --> 53:14.275
No, Nurse Franklin.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.360
I am.

53:20.960 --> 53:22.518
She looks a bit like you, Perry.

53:23.120 --> 53:24.120
Same little nose.

53:25.720 --> 53:27.153
Not so much like Belinda.

53:27.880 --> 53:29.632
She always had a clever-looking face.

53:31.960 --> 53:34.679
Did Dad tell you
she didn't come out quite right?

53:34.760 --> 53:36.079
Yeah.

53:36.240 --> 53:37.600
But it's not the end of the world.

53:38.680 --> 53:41.638
When she's wrapped up,
she looks just like a normal baby.

53:42.840 --> 53:44.592
And later on, if people call her names,

53:44.680 --> 53:47.672
you'll just have to fight them,
won't you, Perry? Yeah!

53:47.800 --> 53:49.028
'Cause she's ours.

53:54.600 --> 53:55.600
She's so soft.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.436
She's going to have skin
like a Camay advert.

53:59.080 --> 54:00.656
The first thing
the nurse said to me was,

54:00.680 --> 54:03.592
"She's got a beautiful, beautiful face",
and she has.

54:05.400 --> 54:08.039
You see, sometimes in life,

54:08.680 --> 54:11.399
you've got to be grateful
for what you have got.

54:14.920 --> 54:16.558
Not what you've not got.

54:19.480 --> 54:20.480
Can I hold her?

54:21.240 --> 54:22.240
- Yeah.
- No.

54:25.160 --> 54:28.072
He'll be too rough.
He might hurt her.

54:30.800 --> 54:31.800
Give her here.

54:44.160 --> 54:45.160
We'll manage.

54:47.840 --> 54:49.353
We always have.

54:52.600 --> 54:53.919
Bring her home.

55:08.280 --> 55:10.919
What a beautiful table you keep,
Sister Julienne.

55:11.360 --> 55:14.796
Family meals are very important
at Nonnatus House, Mrs Busby.

55:14.960 --> 55:17.918
It was never like this
at that nurses' home, was it, <i>cariad.</i>

55:18.480 --> 55:20.040
I still wish they hadn't demolished it.

55:20.440 --> 55:22.616
Where are you going to stay
when you take up your job again?

55:22.640 --> 55:25.200
I'm not.
I'm going home to Wales.

55:25.680 --> 55:26.680
Really?

55:26.920 --> 55:28.911
There's nowhere suitable
for her to live, Sister.

55:29.200 --> 55:30.428
She's been so poorly.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.116
Your daughter is welcome
to lodge here with us.

55:35.800 --> 55:37.995
I think that's
a most-suitable suggestion.

55:41.360 --> 55:42.360
So do I.

55:46.840 --> 55:47.840
I don't know.

55:49.400 --> 55:50.400
I do.

55:52.040 --> 55:54.554
We cherish our young women, Mrs Busby,

55:55.240 --> 55:56.673
and they keep us on our toes.

55:57.200 --> 56:00.272
I fear, without them,
we would flounder.

56:04.680 --> 56:05.999
Thank you so much...

56:06.080 --> 56:08.913
<i>And so the Easter
festivities ended</i>

56:09.160 --> 56:11.469
<i>and several new chapters began.</i>

56:14.080 --> 56:18.073
<i>In the spring of 1961, the sun shone.</i>

56:18.880 --> 56:22.190
<i>The moon was suddenly
within the reach of man.</i>

56:23.600 --> 56:25.875
<i>Science was all-powerful.</i>

56:26.120 --> 56:27.951
<i>All medicine was good.</i>

56:28.560 --> 56:29.675
Belinda!

56:35.080 --> 56:37.548
<i>The day would come, too soon,</i>

56:37.800 --> 56:40.155
<i>when Susan could no longer
be wrapped up</i>

56:40.360 --> 56:42.920
<i>or protected from the gaze of strangers.</i>

56:43.840 --> 56:47.992
<i>Her parents' questions would
be matched by those of other people.</i>

56:49.280 --> 56:52.716
<i>And in time, their bewildered "whys",</i>

56:53.040 --> 56:55.508
<i>would meet with a one-word answer.</i>

56:56.000 --> 56:57.592
<i>No-one foresaw this,</i>

56:57.720 --> 57:02.919
<i>or that a scandal would be sparked
that would rock the world for years.</i>

57:04.280 --> 57:05.918
<i>And there was love,</i>

57:06.120 --> 57:09.237
<i>because love grows
when nothing else is certain,</i>

57:09.560 --> 57:13.394
<i>changing its shape,
to fill the space required.</i>

57:15.200 --> 57:17.350
The docks are brutal
and I need men that's fit for it.

57:17.600 --> 57:20.433
Men give you their lives,
at least respect them.

57:20.720 --> 57:21.720
We need an ambulance.

57:21.920 --> 57:24.354
These are wonderful days, girls.

57:24.720 --> 57:27.188
<i>Go out there and take hold of them!</i>

57:27.440 --> 57:28.920
You're quite the warrior, aren't you?

57:30.040 --> 57:33.396
Baby has the best
and it's free, the breast.

57:33.640 --> 57:35.200
Can't I try him on a bottle of formula?

57:35.320 --> 57:36.880
I thought you had more sense than that.

57:37.120 --> 57:38.520
Connie, what are you talking about?

57:38.880 --> 57:41.155
If I can't give him nothing,
what good am I?
