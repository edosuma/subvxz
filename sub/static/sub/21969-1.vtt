03:28.709 --> 03:31.462
Where were you during Lauds?
Why did you miss Lauds?

03:31.754 --> 03:33.356
She got out last night,
and I had to find her.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.380
Took me all morning.

03:34.465 --> 03:36.342
- She got out again?
- Yeah.

03:36.634 --> 03:38.385
Do you think she's getting
through the gate?

03:38.677 --> 03:39.345
You think she could
get through the gate?

03:39.637 --> 03:40.763
I should check the gates.

03:41.055 --> 03:42.375
Or maybe she got through
the wall.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.242
How would she get
through the wall, though?

03:44.266 --> 03:46.386
I don't know.
Why do you care about
the donkey so much?

03:46.518 --> 03:47.937
Just doesn't make any sense.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.564
Why are you wearing
your black habit? It's spring.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.096
Because it was dark
when I left,

03:52.316 --> 03:54.002
and it was the closest thing
to me, so I grabbed it.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.026
I'm gonna change.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.987
Why are you asking me
so many questions?

03:58.822 --> 04:00.157
Beautiful morning, Sisters.

04:00.449 --> 04:02.093
- Hey, don't fucking
talk to us!
- Fucking creep.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.429
- I told you to never talk
to us, you piece of shit!
- How dare you, fuckers!

04:04.453 --> 04:05.773
Get the fuck
out of here!

04:13.420 --> 04:16.882
Blessed art thou, O Lord.
Teach me to know thy will.

04:17.173 --> 04:21.512
By these lips, let the awards
thou makest ever be recorded.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.390
Blithely, as one that has
found great possessions,

04:24.682 --> 04:26.767
I follow thy decrees.

04:27.059 --> 04:29.687
Bethinking me still
of the charge thou givest,

04:29.979 --> 04:31.981
I will mark thy footsteps.

04:32.273 --> 04:33.899
Be thy covenant
ever my delight,

04:35.192 --> 04:37.194
thy words kept in memory.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.949
Christ the Lord was tempted
and suffered for us.

04:42.241 --> 04:44.243
Come, let us adore him.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.175
So, why weren't you at Lauds
this morning?

04:46.370 --> 04:48.850
Because the donkey
escaped in the woods,
and I had to catch her.

04:49.123 --> 04:50.374
The donkey escaped again?

04:50.666 --> 04:52.459
Yeah. I think she got through
the gate.

04:52.751 --> 04:53.751
She got through the gate.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.776
- All right. Well...
- But I'll make sure
it doesn't happen again.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.280
Okay, good.
I'll tell Father Tommasso.

05:35.044 --> 05:36.521
What's going on
with Sister Alessandra?

05:36.545 --> 05:38.464
She's been so out of it.

05:38.756 --> 05:40.859
I don't know.
Her dad's probably visiting
or something.

05:40.883 --> 05:41.967
Again?

05:42.259 --> 05:43.719
Yeah.
She's fucking delusional.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.554
Yeah. She's so delusional.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.724
She's pathetic.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.060
Just because your dad
gives money to the convent,

05:51.352 --> 05:52.871
doesn't mean you're gonna
get everything you want.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.146
Yeah.

05:54.438 --> 05:55.582
I walked in on her
the other day,

05:55.606 --> 05:57.292
and she was literally
just staring out the window

05:57.316 --> 05:58.636
for, like, 10 minutes,
not moving.

05:58.901 --> 06:00.152
Really?

06:00.444 --> 06:03.155
She's probably, like,
daydreaming about some guy

06:03.447 --> 06:05.592
that's gonna magically come
and take her away from here.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.201
It's like, "Good luck."

06:08.243 --> 06:09.286
I know.

06:19.004 --> 06:22.299
So, what was Mother Marea
saying to you earlier?

06:22.591 --> 06:24.885
Nothing. Mind your own
fucking business.

06:40.859 --> 06:41.859
Okay.

06:42.111 --> 06:43.351
But I'll do that,
yeah.

06:43.445 --> 06:44.725
I can sweep it
if you want me to.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.591
For some reason,
it keeps getting unorganized,

06:46.615 --> 06:48.009
and I'm not really sure
who's doing that.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.844
Okay, yes, maybe
you could sweep the cellar,

06:49.868 --> 06:51.578
because that's very dusty,
you know.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.431
That's the cellar
and the altar.

06:53.455 --> 06:54.706
I can organize
all the incense,

06:54.998 --> 06:56.768
because, for some reason,
it keeps getting
all messed up,

06:56.792 --> 06:58.392
and I'm not really sure
who's doing that.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.313
But also, Mother,
there's something else
you should know.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.463
Yes?

07:01.755 --> 07:02.756
Last night at dinner...

07:03.424 --> 07:05.968
- Mmm-hmm.
- I saw Sister Latizia
take two portions.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.612
I don't know.
Maybe you're not counting,

07:07.636 --> 07:08.846
so maybe it doesn't matter.

07:09.138 --> 07:11.223
Just in case you are,
it was Sister Latizia.

07:13.434 --> 07:14.828
I don't think you should
be concerning yourself

07:14.852 --> 07:16.854
with the amount
somebody is eating.

07:17.146 --> 07:20.149
We all require
different amounts of food.

07:20.441 --> 07:23.819
I know that some days I need
more food, some days less...

07:24.111 --> 07:25.404
So, watching me eat
so carefully,

07:25.696 --> 07:27.656
that would make
me uncomfortable.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.784
So I don't think you should be
bothering yourself with that.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.076
Yes, Mother.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.371
Hi, Dad.

07:34.663 --> 07:35.664
Hi, sweetheart.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.396
How are you, my angel?

07:37.624 --> 07:38.792
I'm good. How are you?

07:39.084 --> 07:41.044
I'm well. You look beautiful.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.421
Thank you.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.506
What I can make out.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.842
You look terrific.
Are they feeding you?

07:47.134 --> 07:49.136
Eh...

07:49.428 --> 07:51.908
They should be feeding you,
for all the money
we send them here.

07:52.097 --> 07:53.140
But you look beautiful.

07:53.432 --> 07:54.808
Thank you. Thank you.
How's Mom?

07:55.100 --> 07:57.603
Mom is good. Mom is...
Everybody's well.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.063
Good. The merchant Ricardo,
how's he?

08:00.355 --> 08:03.567
Merchant Ricardo, uh, yes.
Glad you brought it up.
He's good.

08:03.859 --> 08:04.859
Has he asked about me?

08:04.985 --> 08:05.985
Sure. You bet he has.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.236
Hmm.

08:07.488 --> 08:08.888
You know, last time
you and I spoke,

08:10.491 --> 08:12.343
I was hoping that we'd have
the whole dowry situation
locked up,

08:12.367 --> 08:14.786
and, um,
we're not there just yet.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.497
They're asking
for a lot of money,

08:16.788 --> 08:19.875
and, you know, with the money
we're sending here,

08:20.167 --> 08:22.711
and then to your sisters
and their children, it's a...

08:23.003 --> 08:26.840
There's a lot of money
going out and not
that much coming in, so...

08:27.132 --> 08:30.636
But maybe if we sent less
money here to the convent,

08:30.928 --> 08:32.221
we could save it up,

08:32.513 --> 08:34.633
and I could even come and live
with you and Mom and...

08:34.806 --> 08:36.743
I don't think sending less
money here is a good idea,

08:36.767 --> 08:39.977
because, uh, that would
reflect badly on the family.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.482
But I know how eager you are
to be married, my baby.

08:43.774 --> 08:47.528
I know, but maybe it's...
Maybe that's not your calling.

08:49.947 --> 08:52.574
How's your embroidery going?
You still doing that?

08:52.866 --> 08:53.866
Mmm-hmm.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.154
Good, 'cause you're so good,

08:56.119 --> 08:57.679
and maybe that's your calling,
you know.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.934
Some people,
it's marriage and family
and the warmth of a home,

09:00.958 --> 09:03.293
and maybe for you it's...
It's the detailed embroidery.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.672
You know, keep... Please.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.423
Keep your chin up.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.035
Give me...
Give me a little sugar.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.928
Hey, hey, sweetie.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.013
All right. Daddy loves you.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.515
I love you.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.768
Okay. All right,
you take care, and...

09:20.060 --> 09:21.700
You don't... Don't...
Don't you lose hope.

09:35.617 --> 09:36.970
The body of Christ.

09:36.994 --> 09:37.994
Amen.

09:40.622 --> 09:41.999
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.211
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

09:50.716 --> 09:52.384
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.265
Are you all right?

10:01.310 --> 10:02.394
The body of Christ.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.905
So, Sister Alessandra,
how was your father's visit?

10:15.866 --> 10:16.866
Good.

10:17.993 --> 10:18.993
Good?

10:19.870 --> 10:21.330
Yes, it was good.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.419
Any potential suitors?

10:29.379 --> 10:31.214
That's not even what his visit
was about.

10:31.506 --> 10:32.692
We didn't even talk
about that.

10:32.716 --> 10:33.860
Then what was his visit about?

10:33.884 --> 10:34.968
Oh, my God!

10:36.470 --> 10:38.031
Hey, I told you not to fucking
look at us, you creep.

10:38.055 --> 10:39.055
I'm sorry. I am...

10:39.264 --> 10:40.784
Why are you making eye contact
with us?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.684
Look at the ground,
you fucking pervert!

10:42.976 --> 10:44.120
- I'm sorry.
- What is this shit?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.144
This is a turnip.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.372
That's not a turnip!
It's shit!

10:46.396 --> 10:47.439
Ouch.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.168
You expect us to eat shit?
You're a piece of shit!

10:50.192 --> 10:52.462
- Yeah, you are a piece
of shit. You're disgusting!
- I'm sorry.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.086
Yeah, you are
a disgusting piece of shit!

10:54.196 --> 10:55.716
Think we can just eat
any of this food?

10:56.156 --> 10:58.196
We're fucking starving!
You can't do anything right!

10:58.408 --> 11:00.248
Look at this wall!
Look at the stuff you build!

11:00.827 --> 11:02.227
It's horrible,
you fucking imbecile!

11:02.371 --> 11:03.580
What do you even do here?

11:03.872 --> 11:04.539
- Please, please.
- Think you can talk to us?

11:04.831 --> 11:05.975
You think you can look at us?

11:05.999 --> 11:07.125
You know who my father is?

11:07.417 --> 11:08.460
Yes! He deserves this!

11:08.877 --> 11:10.938
He pays you good money
to do nothing, you little rat!

11:10.962 --> 11:12.602
You're a little fucking rat!

11:12.839 --> 11:14.108
What is this, maggot food?

11:14.132 --> 11:15.372
- We hate you!
- Please, please.

11:16.468 --> 11:17.945
Just hoarding all the food,
huh, like a fucking Jew?

11:17.969 --> 11:19.009
Is that what you're doing?

11:19.137 --> 11:20.681
We're all starving!

11:20.972 --> 11:21.972
You know what you did!

11:22.224 --> 11:23.392
We hate you!

11:23.684 --> 11:24.684
You deserve to die!

11:29.398 --> 11:31.274
All right. Almost ready?

11:31.566 --> 11:32.566
Tommasso, yes.

11:33.652 --> 11:35.445
- Almost ready.
- Oh, look at this!

11:35.737 --> 11:36.737
Isn't it beautiful?

11:36.905 --> 11:38.105
That's gorgeous. Who did that?

11:38.281 --> 11:39.366
Sister Alessandra.

11:39.658 --> 11:40.367
We have to make more of that.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.369
That'll go big in town.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.413
Tell Lurco to keep
that garden gate closed,

11:44.705 --> 11:46.145
because the deer
are getting into it.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.331
All right.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.204
All right,
my friend.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.758
Are you ready for a journey?
Are you ready?

11:57.050 --> 11:58.736
"Know when the leaf
parts from the ash

11:58.760 --> 12:01.263
"and the branches wizen
in the treetop

12:01.555 --> 12:05.183
"for through the bark,
the sweet humor of the sap
doesn't mount to them

12:07.060 --> 12:09.688
"and the birds have fallen
silent from their warbling

12:09.980 --> 12:11.815
"because of the cold
that grips them.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.568
"But in spite of this all,
I'm unshaken

12:14.860 --> 12:16.153
"for I am rejuvenated
and prosper

12:16.445 --> 12:18.029
"when all the other happiness
is wasted.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.824
"And if all my merriment
is saddened

12:21.116 --> 12:22.676
"to the point
of not boasting openly..."

12:23.952 --> 12:25.287
"It hasn't however kept
my praise

12:25.579 --> 12:26.705
"from gaining me..."

12:26.997 --> 12:28.391
- They're not good people.
- No, Lurco...

12:28.415 --> 12:31.084
No, I'm leaving.
The nuns, no. They spit on me.

12:31.376 --> 12:32.729
- Who spit on you?
- They spit on me.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.546
Lurco, I have to leave.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.758
I'm about to leave
to go to the market
to sell the fabrics, please!

12:38.049 --> 12:39.944
Father, I'm very sorry,
I'm very sorry.
They spit on me.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.261
They called me a Jew.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.364
- They called me a Jew,
Father Tommasso.
- Lurco, please.

12:43.388 --> 12:44.668
- They called me a Jew.
- Please.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.684
Please, just wait two days!

12:53.398 --> 12:55.251
I want to think
we've had a nice life.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.653
I think I surround you
in a lifestyle

12:58.945 --> 13:00.822
that is pleasant
and luxurious.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.366
Enjoy this pheasant.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.788
Soon as Florence gets here,

13:08.079 --> 13:11.208
we'll be eating chicken like
a bunch of fucking Croatians.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.669
I sent another messenger
to Florence.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.087
Messenger came back.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.256
He's dealing
with the Guelph soldiers.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.759
He's got Florence.
He's got Arezzo.

13:21.051 --> 13:23.345
He doesn't have Pisa yet,
but he will,

13:24.513 --> 13:25.722
and then he's coming for us.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.724
So, I sent a messenger
to Arezzo.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.185
He's not in Arezzo.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.477
He's in Pisa.

13:33.355 --> 13:34.995
He's going...
He's making a play for Pisa!

13:36.233 --> 13:38.777
He doesn't have Pisa yet,
but he will.

13:39.069 --> 13:41.279
They're weak,
like the Guelphs.

13:41.571 --> 13:44.866
You know what comes
after Pisa? Lucca.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.785
He's coming
for our silk trade.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.745
So, my dear,

13:49.037 --> 13:51.581
enjoy this lavish lifestyle,
your two dresses,

13:53.208 --> 13:56.336
your pheasant, your lentils.
Live it up.

13:56.628 --> 13:57.628
It's coming to an end.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.924
This... This Florentine
conspiracy thing

14:01.216 --> 14:02.360
is getting to the point
of, like,

14:02.384 --> 14:04.111
he talks about it so much,
it's like a mental illness.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.571
- I'll be fake sleeping...
- Mmm-hmm.

14:05.595 --> 14:06.995
...and he's still going on
about it.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.449
- "We're gonna
lose everything."
- Mmm-hmm.

14:08.473 --> 14:09.867
And that's what... I'm like...
At this point, I'm like,

14:09.891 --> 14:12.011
"You know what? I hope we do,
just so you'll shut up."

14:12.060 --> 14:13.520
- Just shut up.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:13.979 --> 14:17.816
He thinks that everything
that happens
is because of them.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.308
Yeah, he says a lot of things.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.779
He's just...
Just, it's not...
Even his tone is awful.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.715
Yeah? You act like I don't
suffer through it, too.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.575
I'm right there with you.

14:28.410 --> 14:29.744
That sounded like him.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.236
- Hmm?
- That sounded like him.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.873
No, no, that's not him.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.708
He's always asleep.
Just relax.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.627
You're so cute.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.759
- I felt like...
I felt I heard the...
- No, no.

14:39.963 --> 14:42.424
All right,
we're gonna fuck again.
That'll help you relax.

14:42.716 --> 14:43.925
No! That is him.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.638
No! That's... That is him.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.015
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

14:54.269 --> 14:55.478
What have you done?

14:55.770 --> 14:57.147
Oh, what have I done?

14:57.439 --> 15:00.150
Oh, what's out there?
Is it the Guelphs?

15:00.442 --> 15:02.694
Is it Florence?
Are they coming? Go get 'em!

15:02.986 --> 15:04.321
I shall deal with you shortly.

15:05.614 --> 15:06.865
I'm petrified.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.980
Now I'll know who you are
in the morning.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.315
We'll settle this in private.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.272
I'll tell you
what happened, 100%.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.834
A demon came in here
while we were sleeping
and cut our hair.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.569
There's no way
to prove it's not
a demon, so...

17:07.861 --> 17:09.046
Which means
that it was a demon.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.190
What else was it? A warlock?

17:16.368 --> 17:17.494
Good morning.

17:18.496 --> 17:19.496
My liege.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.682
You common-born dogs.

17:40.018 --> 17:43.605
One of you sluts thinks
he's quite the jester.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.068
What the fuck
are you looking at?

17:52.322 --> 17:54.240
I'll fuck you
where you breathe.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.580
What was that all about, huh?

18:03.291 --> 18:06.127
I saw Guelph men
rush into town...

18:06.419 --> 18:09.672
Savage beasts,
tearing men from limb to limb.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.717
I saw a little boy's head
crushed between a...

18:13.009 --> 18:16.137
A man's boot and...
And a stone.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.265
His eyeballs
came skittering across.

18:19.557 --> 18:24.604
I saw my beautiful
eight-year-old sister,
Benicia,

18:24.896 --> 18:28.900
cleaved in half
with one swipe of a sword
by the Guelphs.

18:29.192 --> 18:33.113
She was more beautifully
developed as a woman
than you are today.

18:33.404 --> 18:36.407
You see this copper
in my hair?

18:36.699 --> 18:39.786
She had the most beautiful
hair of this color
all over her body.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.413
Shut up.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.308
Stop talking about this,
not at the table, okay?

18:44.332 --> 18:46.060
No more eyeballs or squishing
and all that kind of stuff.

18:46.084 --> 18:47.812
I don't want to hear about
any more violence
at the table,

18:47.836 --> 18:49.396
'cause I'm eating,
and I'm digesting, so stop it.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.420
Silence!

18:51.422 --> 18:52.966
How dare you?

18:53.675 --> 18:55.844
You are weak.

18:56.136 --> 19:00.390
I've begun to suspect
you have Guelph blood
coursing through your veins.

19:00.682 --> 19:03.935
Oh, no. How did you find out?

19:04.227 --> 19:07.480
I will bring the Devil's goad
to your bedchamber
this evening,

19:08.731 --> 19:10.400
and it will be
freshly polished.

19:10.692 --> 19:11.985
No.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.437
We're not doing that anymore.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.964
You're not putting anything
in there.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.048
Nothing's coming out, nothing.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.323
We'll see about that.

19:17.615 --> 19:18.695
I'm not doing that anymore.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.419
- I need a refill.
- Don't.

19:31.212 --> 19:32.714
- Oh.
- Please don't do this.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.692
I just need
a quick little refill.
Come here.

19:34.716 --> 19:35.925
- Come here.
- You're insane.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.363
- You've been so sweet to me.
- Stop, stop. Somebody's
gonna catch us!

19:39.387 --> 19:41.282
- Look, look, you're gonna
get me fuckin' killed!
- Uh-huh.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.307
If someone catches me...

19:42.724 --> 19:44.724
I don't want to hurt you!
I don't want to hurt you!

19:44.851 --> 19:46.203
- Take your pants off, then.
- No, get off!

19:46.227 --> 19:48.067
It's like, why are there
so many folds in here?

19:51.441 --> 19:53.109
Shit. Oh, shit.

19:55.403 --> 19:56.821
Bring me his goddamn balls.

19:58.281 --> 19:59.741
Shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.953
God dang it!
Your twigs are
all over the place.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.877
Keeping up?
You keeping up?

20:11.169 --> 20:12.438
- Just go without me!
- Go without you?

20:12.462 --> 20:13.462
I'll get there.

20:15.298 --> 20:16.966
Masseto, let's talk
about this!

20:17.258 --> 20:18.718
Just stop! Stop!

20:22.055 --> 20:24.098
Masseto, come on!

20:24.390 --> 20:25.558
Masseto, come on!

20:25.850 --> 20:26.850
No running!

20:27.268 --> 20:28.311
Masseto!

20:30.813 --> 20:31.940
Masseto!

21:10.103 --> 21:11.437
Oh, no!

21:21.155 --> 21:22.615
Oh, no!

21:23.825 --> 21:24.825
No.

21:31.916 --> 21:32.959
Father?

21:33.251 --> 21:35.336
You stay away! These are mine!

21:35.628 --> 21:36.689
No, it just looks like you...

21:36.713 --> 21:37.833
You stay away! They're mine!

21:37.964 --> 21:38.964
Hey, stop! Stop!

21:39.215 --> 21:40.508
I'm just trying to help you!

21:40.800 --> 21:42.302
If you're a bandit,
I will strike you!

21:42.593 --> 21:44.073
You can either lose all
of your stuff,

21:44.220 --> 21:45.972
or you can trust me
and let me help you!

21:46.264 --> 21:48.599
I was entrusted to take care
of these things,

21:48.891 --> 21:50.310
and I've ruined this!

21:50.601 --> 21:52.687
The sisters made
all these things,

21:52.979 --> 21:55.231
- and I've lost them
in the water.
- It's all right.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.763
- And now I've fallen...
- It's all right.
I'm gonna help.

22:00.403 --> 22:01.487
Are you all right?

22:01.779 --> 22:03.197
I'm drunk!

22:03.489 --> 22:05.575
And I have fallen
with my cart,

22:05.867 --> 22:08.036
and this animal went
the wrong way.

22:08.328 --> 22:09.972
All right, all right,
all right, all right,
just stay down.

22:09.996 --> 22:10.996
Stay down, please.

22:20.757 --> 22:22.717
There. That's it. All right.

22:26.054 --> 22:28.848
I wish there was something
I could give you in repayment.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.744
- I have no money. Or wine...
- No, Father, I don't need
any money, or wine.

22:31.768 --> 22:34.228
That's... That's totally fine.
Yeah.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.315
Are you sure there's nothing
I can do to repay you?

22:37.607 --> 22:40.276
I don't know.
If you maybe had a place
for me to stay tonight,

22:40.568 --> 22:41.235
I would really appreciate it.

22:41.527 --> 22:42.527
You have nowhere to stay?

22:42.695 --> 22:43.695
No.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.365
Oh, you're coming with me.

22:47.283 --> 22:49.577
It was a total disaster.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.669
I never should have stopped
to speak to Lurco.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.289
That's what's held me up.

22:53.581 --> 22:56.000
And then I was out at night.

22:56.292 --> 22:59.420
I had to drink the wine,
because I had no water.

22:59.712 --> 23:02.256
And then I just didn't realize
how drunk I was getting,

23:02.548 --> 23:03.591
and I've lost everything!

23:03.883 --> 23:05.093
I'm sorry, Father.

23:05.385 --> 23:06.695
I wish there was more
I could have done.

23:06.719 --> 23:07.804
How am I gonna explain?

23:08.096 --> 23:09.180
No, no, it's all right.

23:09.472 --> 23:11.099
You've done...
You've done a lot.

23:16.687 --> 23:19.399
Right, here you are.
Fresh bread for you.

23:20.483 --> 23:23.361
Oh, careful. Go...
Take it easy.

23:23.653 --> 23:25.653
It's really, really good.

23:26.531 --> 23:30.618
Good, good. I'm...
I'm sorry I was so...

23:32.412 --> 23:35.206
Excited and upset before. I...

23:35.498 --> 23:36.582
That's all right. That's...

23:38.501 --> 23:39.877
Would you like some wine?

23:40.753 --> 23:42.046
Bottom up. Up.

23:42.672 --> 23:44.298
Up! Uh-uh...

23:47.885 --> 23:49.095
I didn't touch it.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.643
This has been wonderful.

23:55.935 --> 23:56.935
Too wonderful.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.103
What a blessing!

23:59.689 --> 24:01.875
- The best blessing
I have ever experienced.
- You saved me!

24:01.899 --> 24:03.734
You saved me! Are you kidding?

24:04.026 --> 24:05.611
I'm not kidding.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.196
I didn't save you.

24:07.488 --> 24:09.907
I couldn't put it...
The wheel of the donkey cart
back on.

24:11.993 --> 24:14.245
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

24:14.537 --> 24:18.166
It has been years,

24:18.458 --> 24:20.376
many years
since my last confession.

24:20.668 --> 24:22.378
- Hmm.
- Here are my sins.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.589
I have slept
with another man's wife.

24:24.881 --> 24:28.426
He's a nobleman,
and he is my master.

24:28.718 --> 24:29.760
Well, that's adultery.

24:30.887 --> 24:32.096
I know.

24:32.388 --> 24:33.389
It's a very serious sin.

24:33.681 --> 24:34.682
Sometimes...

24:35.933 --> 24:40.605
She would place her mouth
around my sex.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.608
Well, that's sodomy.

24:44.859 --> 24:46.402
It's also a serious sin.

24:46.694 --> 24:49.447
Is it also considered
sodomy if...

24:49.739 --> 24:54.744
If I placed my mouth
on her sex while...

24:55.036 --> 24:58.372
She simultaneously had...
Had her mouth around mine?

25:00.583 --> 25:01.626
Why would you do that?

25:03.169 --> 25:05.087
Because she... She liked it.

25:05.379 --> 25:06.379
Oh.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.762
Well, yes, that's also sodomy.

25:13.054 --> 25:15.932
I thought sodomy was...
Was just when I would...

25:16.224 --> 25:20.019
When someone would penetrate
the rear... The rear end.

25:21.479 --> 25:24.440
Yes, that's...
That's also sodomy.

25:24.732 --> 25:28.986
- That's the traditional
form of sodomy.
- Right.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.446
Did you do that?

25:30.738 --> 25:33.866
I... I did. Yes, I...
That also occurred.

25:34.158 --> 25:35.998
But you didn't spill your seed
in the rear end?

25:36.202 --> 25:37.245
No, no, I did not.

25:37.537 --> 25:38.579
Good, good.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.290
I would spill my seed
on her... Um...

25:41.582 --> 25:44.794
On her back or on her bosom.

25:45.086 --> 25:48.256
But most of the time,
she would request

25:48.548 --> 25:50.675
that I spill my seed
all over her face.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.222
Well...

25:57.848 --> 25:59.642
These are serious sins.

25:59.934 --> 26:03.145
And do you regret doing
these things?

26:03.437 --> 26:05.523
I've learned my lesson,
I really have.

26:05.815 --> 26:07.895
And I just... I don't want
to be that person anymore.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.361
If I go back out on the road,
they will catch me,

26:10.653 --> 26:11.737
and they will kill me.

26:12.029 --> 26:15.741
Well, I'll give you
your penance.

26:16.033 --> 26:18.703
- I want you to say
- Yeah.

26:18.995 --> 26:19.995
...and 15 Our Fathers.

26:20.121 --> 26:21.497
Yes.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.457
Now, as to the other situation

26:24.667 --> 26:26.627
about you being pursued,

26:28.754 --> 26:31.465
I think I may have a solution

26:31.757 --> 26:33.634
that can be a blessing
to both of us.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.303
Yes, thank you, Father.
Thank you.

26:39.974 --> 26:42.310
- Good morning, Marea.
- Good morning.

26:42.602 --> 26:43.978
- Is it a good time?
- Yes.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.350
I'd like to introduce you
to someone.
This is Masseto.

26:47.481 --> 26:49.525
- He's a deaf-mute.
- Oh.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.861
I met him on my trip
and spoke to his family,

26:52.153 --> 26:55.153
and they explained to me
that he's very good with
gardening, light carpentry.

26:55.239 --> 26:57.283
I think he could help us
repair the cloister

26:57.575 --> 26:59.375
and do all of the things
that Lurco was doing.

26:59.577 --> 27:01.495
And I thought the fact
that he's a deaf-mute,

27:01.787 --> 27:04.040
there would be a lot less
conflicts with the sisters.

27:04.332 --> 27:06.459
I can't believe you met
a deaf-mute on your trip.

27:06.751 --> 27:08.711
How was your trip?
Did you sell any fabrics?

27:09.003 --> 27:10.588
We should talk about it
in private.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.120
But you said
he was a deaf-mute.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.634
Right. Um...

27:16.469 --> 27:18.095
I was robbed.

27:18.387 --> 27:19.388
Were you hurt?

27:19.680 --> 27:20.680
No, no, no. I'm fine.

27:21.932 --> 27:23.772
I wasn't hurt, but the bandits
took everything.

27:25.227 --> 27:26.913
They took all the embroidery,
all of the silk,

27:26.937 --> 27:28.022
so I made no sale.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.274
- I've come back empty-handed.
I'm sorry.

27:32.276 --> 27:33.996
What can I say?
I'm very embarrassed, but...

27:34.945 --> 27:36.530
It's gonna be fine.

27:36.822 --> 27:39.051
All right.
Don't worry too much about it.
I'll get him started.

27:39.075 --> 27:40.159
We go. We go.

28:27.498 --> 28:28.498
Hi.

28:33.337 --> 28:34.505
Who are you?

28:37.049 --> 28:38.217
I'm Sister Ginevra.

28:40.511 --> 28:41.511
What are you doing?

28:45.641 --> 28:46.726
You're digging a ditch?

28:49.145 --> 28:50.145
You're digging a ditch.

28:58.988 --> 28:59.988
All right.

29:04.869 --> 29:06.746
Since God
is perfect,

29:07.037 --> 29:11.584
it's our job to live in unison
with His essence.

29:11.876 --> 29:16.338
But sometimes it's difficult
to find that happiness

29:16.630 --> 29:18.841
and things don't go our way.

29:19.133 --> 29:22.678
And we feel like
we're being punished,
and it's not...

29:24.972 --> 29:26.932
Thank you, Sister Fernanda.
Thank you.

29:27.224 --> 29:28.224
Of course.

29:30.853 --> 29:31.853
Um...

29:32.980 --> 29:35.858
But God...
God is... Is perfect.

29:37.860 --> 29:39.779
Fernanda! That's enough!

29:40.821 --> 29:42.656
- What?
- This is...

29:42.948 --> 29:44.548
Viola, go inside
and finish your reading.

29:46.035 --> 29:48.287
Stop it! Stop that!

29:48.579 --> 29:50.122
What are you doing?

29:50.414 --> 29:52.750
I said stop that!
That is enough!

29:53.042 --> 29:54.251
What's gotten into you today?

29:54.543 --> 29:55.753
Nothing. I'm so sorry.

29:57.588 --> 29:59.483
You know what?
I'll just go scoop some dung
or scrub the cellars...

29:59.507 --> 30:00.776
I don't know where
this is coming from!

30:00.800 --> 30:02.440
...and not bother you
while you walk in...

30:16.607 --> 30:17.942
Did he just smile at you?

30:18.234 --> 30:19.234
I don't know.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.800
Why is he smiling?
Who is that? Wait!

30:21.320 --> 30:22.320
Who the fuck are you?

30:22.488 --> 30:23.823
Who are you?

30:24.114 --> 30:25.115
Who are you?

30:25.407 --> 30:26.534
Fernanda, stop!

30:26.909 --> 30:28.678
He's an intruder.
I don't know
who the fuck he is!

30:28.702 --> 30:29.702
Let me get Mother Marea!

30:29.995 --> 30:31.205
Fine! Go!

30:31.539 --> 30:32.539
Tell me who you are.

30:33.499 --> 30:36.001
What? Say something!

30:36.293 --> 30:38.337
Where did you come from?
What is that?

30:38.629 --> 30:39.989
What are you doing
with your hands?

30:40.214 --> 30:42.591
What? What, are you hungry?

30:42.883 --> 30:44.802
What is that, a bird?
You're praying?

30:45.094 --> 30:46.595
What the fuck are you
saying to me?

30:46.887 --> 30:48.180
Fucking tell me who you are!

30:48.472 --> 30:49.974
Don't chop his head off!

30:50.266 --> 30:52.226
He's Masseto!
He's a deaf-mute!
He works for us!

30:52.518 --> 30:54.270
Father Tommasso hired him.

30:54.562 --> 30:56.188
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about it.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.640
You're always complaining
about how Lurco talks to you,

30:58.858 --> 31:00.234
and Masseto doesn't talk.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.446
So, I would really like you
to give him a chance.

31:03.988 --> 31:04.988
Please!

31:06.532 --> 31:07.658
All right.

31:07.950 --> 31:08.950
All right.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.580
And, Sister, I need
to speak to you.

31:17.251 --> 31:19.003
You can get up now!

31:19.545 --> 31:20.545
He can't hear you.

31:21.714 --> 31:22.798
Why are you defending him?

31:24.341 --> 31:26.468
Now!

31:28.345 --> 31:30.639
Father Tommasso was attacked
by a group of bandits, and...

31:31.765 --> 31:32.765
- No.
- He...

31:33.851 --> 31:35.895
Well, all the embroidery
was stolen.

31:40.816 --> 31:45.112
So everything I've done,
everything I've worked on,
is gone?

31:45.404 --> 31:48.574
Yes, I'm afraid
that's what happened.

31:54.455 --> 31:55.956
Are you all right?

31:57.374 --> 31:58.374
Yeah.

31:58.459 --> 31:59.459
It's...

32:00.669 --> 32:02.379
I know this is a lot to...

32:03.130 --> 32:04.256
To swallow.

32:06.425 --> 32:09.094
I'd be more than happy
to get you

32:09.386 --> 32:13.015
extra help for the work,
which will be doubled

32:13.307 --> 32:16.018
to make up for everything
that was lost.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.187
Hello?

33:48.444 --> 33:49.444
Hi.

33:50.738 --> 33:52.740
Um, I broke this.

33:53.741 --> 33:55.534
Can you...

33:55.826 --> 33:57.161
Fix this, yes?

33:58.746 --> 34:01.081
You've... Really kind eyes.

34:02.624 --> 34:05.002
Sorry to just spring this
on you.

34:05.294 --> 34:06.896
It's only 'cause they just
sprang it on me.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.005
You know, they just asked me
to double production

34:09.297 --> 34:10.924
of my embroidery
out of nowhere.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.676
And I'm basically
doing it alone.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.362
They told me that they would
give me help,

34:14.386 --> 34:15.822
and then they just stuck me
with this...

34:15.846 --> 34:19.725
This, like, shriveled up, old,
comatose woman.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.143
And, you know, I look at her,
and I just...

34:22.436 --> 34:23.436
I see me.

34:23.645 --> 34:25.188
That's what I'm gonna become.

34:25.481 --> 34:26.982
I'm just gonna
waste away here.

34:31.277 --> 34:33.197
This is not what I imagined
for myself, you know.

34:35.866 --> 34:37.242
What are you doing?

34:37.534 --> 34:39.620
Why are you hiding in
the weeds like an animal?

34:39.911 --> 34:41.871
I just saw Sister Alessandra
go into the toolshed.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.751
But I know he is not saving up
money for merchant Ricardo.

34:46.043 --> 34:47.753
This is like...
It's not even his fault.

34:48.045 --> 34:50.089
There's just no hope anywhere
in the world.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.757
It's so sad and depressing.

34:53.050 --> 34:54.592
There's no hope for any of us.

34:54.885 --> 34:56.678
Yes, look at you.

34:56.969 --> 35:00.265
Look at you. You can't speak.
You can't hear. It's not fair!

35:00.557 --> 35:02.392
You're just stuck here
with all these bitches,

35:02.684 --> 35:03.684
and so am I!

35:04.895 --> 35:07.314
I just don't even
know what to do!

35:07.606 --> 35:09.024
It's so unfair.

35:16.573 --> 35:18.373
What the fuck
is she doing in there?

35:18.408 --> 35:19.408
I have no idea.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.125
Let us pray.

35:26.416 --> 35:28.961
Lord, give our bodies
restful sleep

35:29.253 --> 35:30.522
and let our work
we have done today

35:30.546 --> 35:33.006
be sown for an eternal harvest

35:33.298 --> 35:35.050
through Christ, our Lord.

35:35.342 --> 35:36.552
Amen.

35:36.844 --> 35:40.264
Lord, grant us a quiet night
and a perfect end. Amen.

35:45.394 --> 35:46.854
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

35:47.146 --> 35:49.106
It has been three days
since my last confession.

35:51.608 --> 35:53.608
And what is it
you would like to confess?

35:54.903 --> 35:56.363
Yesterday, I walked
by the garden,

35:56.655 --> 35:58.133
and I picked a turnip
and I ate the whole thing,

35:58.157 --> 35:59.637
and I didn't share it
with my sisters.

36:01.952 --> 36:03.453
Hmm,
and you regret this?

36:04.454 --> 36:06.290
Yes, Father.

36:06.582 --> 36:08.262
Because it
was greedy, wasn't it?

36:08.542 --> 36:09.585
- It was, Father.
- Hmm.

36:12.337 --> 36:13.337
Anything else?

36:14.631 --> 36:15.631
Yes, Father.

36:18.302 --> 36:20.470
I've been having
impure thoughts.

36:21.346 --> 36:23.307
Hmm.

36:23.599 --> 36:25.039
And have you acted
on these thoughts?

36:25.517 --> 36:26.517
No, Father.

36:29.271 --> 36:31.523
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

36:31.815 --> 36:34.276
It's been two days
since my last confession.

36:34.568 --> 36:36.208
And what do you wish
to confess?

36:36.403 --> 36:39.114
The other day, I found
a turnip in the garden

36:39.406 --> 36:40.949
and I ate it all by myself,

36:41.241 --> 36:42.743
and I didn't share it
with my sisters.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.915
- And it was so delicious...
- Sister.

36:46.121 --> 36:49.124
Ginevra just told me
the same story.

36:49.416 --> 36:50.656
Did you overhear
her confession?

36:53.754 --> 36:54.754
No.

36:57.049 --> 36:59.593
Fine.

36:59.885 --> 37:01.386
Do you have anything else
to confess?

37:02.346 --> 37:03.931
No. I have nothing else
to confess.

37:04.223 --> 37:06.326
Well,
you missed Lauds, Sister.
That's something.

37:06.350 --> 37:09.070
Well, that's because
the donkey escaped
in the woods, and I saved her.

37:09.144 --> 37:10.604
You should be
thanking me, Father.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.273
Look,
I'm just gonna...

37:15.776 --> 37:17.653
I don't know what
to do here.

37:17.945 --> 37:19.905
If you don't confess,
God can't forgive you, so...

37:19.947 --> 37:21.198
I have nothing to confess.

37:21.615 --> 37:23.718
All right.
Well, just go and think about
what you've done.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.542
- Let's try it again next week.
- Yes, Father.

37:33.293 --> 37:34.293
First day.

37:35.128 --> 37:36.463
First day. Thank you.

37:37.381 --> 37:38.465
You survived.

37:38.757 --> 37:39.757
Mmm-hmm.

37:41.218 --> 37:42.594
How's it going?

37:42.886 --> 37:45.086
Yeah, no...
All the work itself,
it went really smoothly.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.105
And I did a lot of great work
in the cloister,

37:47.224 --> 37:49.351
and that was good.

37:49.643 --> 37:54.147
And I met a few of the...
The sisters, and they were...

37:54.439 --> 37:57.067
They were... They were,
you know, very interesting.

37:57.359 --> 37:59.199
And just grateful...
Grateful to be here, so...

38:00.988 --> 38:03.657
These girls can be tough.
I'm not gonna lie.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.534
- They can be very tough.
- Really?

38:05.826 --> 38:06.826
And violent.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.578
Violence? I...

38:08.870 --> 38:11.248
Wow, I just...
I find that so hard
to believe.

38:11.540 --> 38:12.684
They were...
They were so lovely.

38:12.708 --> 38:16.086
They physically
have attacked people.

38:16.378 --> 38:18.755
So, if anything happens,
just tell me.

38:19.047 --> 38:20.215
Yeah. I...

38:20.549 --> 38:23.552
Whatever it is, I can fix it,
but you have to tell me.

38:23.844 --> 38:26.930
I mean, this deaf-mute thing
is there to protect you...

38:27.222 --> 38:28.265
Exactly.

38:28.557 --> 38:30.642
...and to keep the sisters
away from you.

38:30.934 --> 38:32.644
'Cause they can have
a pack mentality.

38:32.936 --> 38:35.397
Ultimately, this is gonna be
a very positive influence.

38:35.689 --> 38:38.442
Living ethically every day,
serving God.

38:38.734 --> 38:40.652
It's really gonna fortify
your soul.

38:40.944 --> 38:44.072
Yeah, you're right.
I think I can learn a lot

38:44.364 --> 38:46.084
by watching the sisters
and everyone around,

38:46.116 --> 38:47.868
who seem very ethical
and, yeah.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.160
Cheers.

38:57.127 --> 38:59.171
Actually, I was gonna ask you,
is it...

38:59.463 --> 39:01.783
Is it all right that we keep
drinking the sacramental wine?

39:03.091 --> 39:06.261
Well, I blessed it, so...

39:08.096 --> 39:10.015
- You blessed it, so it's...
- I mean,

39:10.307 --> 39:12.559
don't mention it
to anyone else, but...

39:12.851 --> 39:15.103
How could I?
I'm deaf and mute, remember?

39:44.925 --> 39:46.134
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:49.012 --> 39:50.292
You're not going to bed,
are you?

39:51.598 --> 39:52.598
No.

39:53.392 --> 39:54.592
Do you have anything to drink?

40:06.905 --> 40:08.782
What do you want?

40:09.074 --> 40:11.118
Father Tommasso
left the ambry unlocked.

40:22.712 --> 40:23.712
Hi. I'm Marta.

40:24.881 --> 40:27.092
She's my childhood friend.

40:27.384 --> 40:29.864
- Yeah, yeah, childhood friend.
- We grew up together.

40:31.304 --> 40:32.931
Are you drunk?

40:33.223 --> 40:35.225
No. And...

40:35.517 --> 40:36.557
Then you should have more.

40:38.228 --> 40:39.479
Your room's gorgeous.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.481
Yeah.
My dad got it for me.

40:41.773 --> 40:44.317
Why is it so big?
It's a lot bigger
than your room.

40:44.609 --> 40:46.528
Is it?

40:46.820 --> 40:47.980
I've never been in your room.

40:49.406 --> 40:50.615
Yes, you have.

40:51.158 --> 40:52.325
No.

40:56.705 --> 40:57.998
Don't laugh.

41:03.003 --> 41:04.171
What are you doing?

41:04.463 --> 41:05.464
Nothing. Go back to bed.

41:07.132 --> 41:08.234
- I can't sleep!
You're too loud!
- Get outta here!

41:08.258 --> 41:09.843
Get the fuck in here!

41:10.135 --> 41:11.553
What are you doing here?

41:11.845 --> 41:13.513
- Shut the fuck up.
- What are you doing?

41:13.805 --> 41:15.140
Who... Who are you?

41:15.432 --> 41:16.516
- Hi.
- That's Marta.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.351
I'm Marta.

41:18.643 --> 41:20.288
You have an accent.
Where are you from?
The south?

41:20.312 --> 41:21.855
- Oh, my God.
- Are you from Umbria?

41:22.147 --> 41:24.274
No. What's she talking about?

41:24.566 --> 41:25.960
- I sound just like you.
- No. She's from here.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.211
- You're not from Gartagnana.
- Yes, she is.

41:27.235 --> 41:28.796
You do not sound like you're
from Gartagnana.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.300
Are you drinking
the sacramental wine?

41:30.447 --> 41:31.948
- Yes.
- No.

41:32.449 --> 41:34.635
- Father Tommasso
drinks it all the time.
- I'm gonna tell Mother Marea.

41:34.659 --> 41:35.243
I'm gonna tell Mother Marea.

41:35.535 --> 41:36.554
Why are you always
telling on people?

41:36.578 --> 41:37.578
Why are you choking me?

41:37.996 --> 41:39.098
Yeah, shut up.
Just drink a little bit of it.

41:39.122 --> 41:40.562
Sister Alessandra wants you
to drink.

41:40.999 --> 41:41.999
Ginevra, it's fine.

41:42.042 --> 41:44.794
Nothing matters in life.
We're all gonna die.

41:45.086 --> 41:46.731
Terrible things are happening
all the time.

41:46.755 --> 41:48.107
You're not allowed
to have visitors here.

41:48.131 --> 41:49.192
- You're not allowed...
- Just enjoy this moment...

41:49.216 --> 41:50.467
We're all gonna die.

41:50.759 --> 41:51.968
And just drink a little wine.

41:52.260 --> 41:53.946
- But we're not gonna get
in trouble?
- Do it.

41:53.970 --> 41:54.970
Do it.

41:55.305 --> 41:56.431
Whoo!

41:58.850 --> 42:02.103
Oh, that tastes bad.
That's bad.

42:03.146 --> 42:04.306
I think there was sand in it.

42:40.684 --> 42:43.228
Is it true
that you've never...

42:43.520 --> 42:45.564
Been touched by a man,
or touched a man?

42:46.106 --> 42:47.106
No.

42:48.108 --> 42:49.234
Never?

42:49.526 --> 42:50.694
No, never.

42:51.152 --> 42:53.321
I feel sad for you.
Do you ever wonder
what it's like?

42:53.613 --> 42:55.824
Why? Is it really so great?

42:56.116 --> 42:58.159
It's the greatest pleasure
on Earth.

42:58.451 --> 42:59.536
- Really?
- Mmm.

43:00.579 --> 43:01.579
Mmm.

43:02.455 --> 43:05.667
Oh, my God, you have no idea.

43:05.959 --> 43:08.837
In fact, it's so good
that I've heard of women

43:09.129 --> 43:11.923
who make this potion
out of this plant belladonna

43:12.215 --> 43:13.215
just to seduce men.

43:16.636 --> 43:19.806
We can't do it,
'cause we would
get locked up.

43:20.098 --> 43:22.767
Yeah, it's a mortal sin.
We wouldn't get into Heaven.

43:23.059 --> 43:24.352
It's a mortal sin.

43:24.644 --> 43:25.913
Yeah, then you probably
shouldn't do it.

43:25.937 --> 43:27.606
Probably shouldn't do it.

43:27.897 --> 43:30.457
Doesn't really matter, anyway,
'cause we're never
gonna know that.

43:32.027 --> 43:33.320
Nothing matters.

43:37.240 --> 43:38.533
Are you really
from Gartagnana?

43:38.825 --> 43:39.909
Yeah. I am.

43:40.201 --> 43:41.453
Mmm-hmm.

44:04.434 --> 44:05.685
Hi, little one.

44:08.480 --> 44:09.480
I don't feel well.

44:11.316 --> 44:12.835
- I don't feel well.
- Yeah, it's 'cause
this is too tight.

44:12.859 --> 44:13.859
No...

44:14.402 --> 44:15.528
Yeah, let's just...

44:15.820 --> 44:17.238
I should go. I should go.

44:17.530 --> 44:19.074
Okay. No, I'm sorry.

44:21.534 --> 44:23.453
I'm sorry! But what is...

44:25.121 --> 44:27.165
Oh, no, it's my room.

44:28.291 --> 44:29.334
This is my room.

44:29.626 --> 44:30.877
Yeah, it's your room.

44:34.756 --> 44:36.049
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

44:36.341 --> 44:37.341
I'm sorry. I don't...

44:53.525 --> 44:55.485
Hi. Um...

44:59.197 --> 45:00.197
Hi.

45:01.032 --> 45:02.032
Hi.

45:03.785 --> 45:05.078
I made this for you.

45:06.246 --> 45:08.832
For you, yes. Let me show you.

45:09.124 --> 45:10.124
You can, um, sort of...

45:17.716 --> 45:20.260
It says thank you, just for...

45:20.552 --> 45:22.192
Just letting me talk
to you the other day.

45:22.387 --> 45:24.180
I talk so crazy, I know.

45:24.472 --> 45:27.851
I mean, you know, you can't,
you know, hear me.

45:28.143 --> 45:31.062
Do you need help?
Do you need help?

45:31.354 --> 45:32.354
I just...

45:35.191 --> 45:37.068
Okay. Is that help for you?

45:39.112 --> 45:41.740
Yeah.
Is that how you do it?

45:42.031 --> 45:43.950
Okay. Okay.

45:44.701 --> 45:46.161
Oh, I'm so dirty.

45:47.620 --> 45:48.913
It's so warm.

45:51.374 --> 45:52.374
It's so hot out here.

45:53.293 --> 45:54.461
Just have to...

45:55.795 --> 45:56.795
Oh...

45:58.590 --> 45:59.799
That's better.

46:14.314 --> 46:15.314
Sorry.

46:20.403 --> 46:21.404
Sorry.

46:46.095 --> 46:47.847
You're right. You're right.

46:48.640 --> 46:49.849
That's too fast.

46:50.892 --> 46:52.852
That's too fast.
We should stop.

46:54.854 --> 46:55.980
Sorry.

46:58.483 --> 46:59.776
Sorry. I'm sorry.

47:01.152 --> 47:02.152
Okay.

47:02.612 --> 47:03.612
Bye.

47:09.744 --> 47:11.621
Glory to God in the highest,

47:11.913 --> 47:13.706
and on Earth,
peace to people of good will.

47:15.542 --> 47:17.919
We praise you. We bless you.

47:18.211 --> 47:21.047
We adore you. We glorify you.

47:21.339 --> 47:24.342
We give you thanks
for your great glory,
Lord God.

47:24.634 --> 47:26.719
Heavenly King, O God,
Almighty Father...

47:39.315 --> 47:40.316
Last night was nice.

47:46.322 --> 47:47.322
Are you tired?

47:47.407 --> 47:48.407
Yeah.

47:49.576 --> 47:50.577
Yeah, me too.

47:52.036 --> 47:53.162
You feel okay?

47:53.454 --> 47:54.454
No, I don't feel good.

47:55.540 --> 47:56.833
I had fun.

47:57.125 --> 47:59.245
I said I don't feel good.
Can you please stop talking?

48:00.545 --> 48:01.671
Well, okay.

48:05.174 --> 48:06.174
Hi, ladies.

48:07.010 --> 48:08.210
What are you doing here?

48:10.471 --> 48:12.724
Um, I was just
in the neighborhood.

48:14.100 --> 48:15.143
What?

48:15.435 --> 48:17.061
I'm kidding.

48:17.353 --> 48:19.939
No, my veil just got
a little dirty,

48:20.231 --> 48:22.609
and I knew you girls
were here,

48:22.901 --> 48:24.694
and I thought I'd come visit

48:24.986 --> 48:26.195
and wash it with you guys.

48:26.487 --> 48:27.727
You're gonna wash
your own veil?

48:30.783 --> 48:32.869
Yeah. Why not?

48:33.161 --> 48:34.162
You never wash anything.

48:36.664 --> 48:38.499
Wasn't last night so fun?

48:38.791 --> 48:39.951
How'd your veil get so dirty?

48:41.836 --> 48:43.671
Um...

48:45.423 --> 48:47.050
Well, earlier I was
in the garden,

48:47.342 --> 48:49.594
and the new handyman was there
digging a ditch,

48:49.886 --> 48:51.596
and I just thought
I'd help him out.

48:51.888 --> 48:52.888
You dug a ditch?

48:53.973 --> 48:55.600
It was actually...
It was really fun.

48:55.892 --> 48:57.018
So, what do I do?

48:57.310 --> 48:59.562
Do I just dip it in the...
In the water?

48:59.854 --> 49:00.854
It's so... Ooh, it's...

49:01.731 --> 49:02.941
It's really dirty over here.

49:04.233 --> 49:06.611
First you put it in the water,

49:06.903 --> 49:09.322
and then you bring it over
to the bowl that has the ash.

49:09.614 --> 49:11.675
And you put it in the bowl,
and you put the ash
on top of it,

49:11.699 --> 49:13.019
and then you let it
sit for a day.

49:13.284 --> 49:14.744
So then tomorrow,
you would come back

49:15.036 --> 49:16.329
and take it out of the bowl,

49:16.621 --> 49:17.681
and then you rinse
it really well in the water...

49:17.705 --> 49:18.745
And then you wring it out,

49:18.957 --> 49:20.416
and then you hang it up
on the line.

49:20.708 --> 49:23.628
Sounds like you are
really good at this...

49:23.920 --> 49:25.964
So, maybe I'll just...

49:26.255 --> 49:27.507
I'll leave it here with you.

49:27.799 --> 49:29.634
This was great.

49:29.926 --> 49:31.469
Thank you. Bye, you guys.

49:31.761 --> 49:32.762
Bye.

49:34.347 --> 49:36.387
Guess I would have ended up
washing this eventually.

49:41.479 --> 49:42.689
Here. Finish this.

49:42.981 --> 49:44.273
I have to go
tidy up the cellar.

49:58.621 --> 49:59.621
Here it is.

50:05.753 --> 50:07.353
Yeah, there should be
enough here.

50:14.554 --> 50:15.972
Sister Fernanda?

50:24.230 --> 50:26.941
Just have to remember not to
get this in your mouth, okay?

50:27.233 --> 50:28.234
I know.

50:34.949 --> 50:37.118
Take off the nun thing.

50:37.410 --> 50:38.690
You'll get it all over it.

50:40.246 --> 50:41.766
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

50:45.793 --> 50:47.128
All right.

51:02.727 --> 51:04.062
Go for it.

51:22.622 --> 51:24.874
Just going to...

51:25.166 --> 51:27.919
Make you look a little more...

51:28.211 --> 51:29.212
Presentable.

51:32.632 --> 51:34.300
Do exactly
what I tell you to do.

51:52.068 --> 51:53.486
Make sure he sees your eyes.

51:56.197 --> 51:57.281
Okay, kiss him.

51:58.658 --> 51:59.951
Kiss him.

52:01.744 --> 52:02.954
Come on.

52:25.059 --> 52:27.061
Okay, get closer.

52:27.353 --> 52:28.553
Careful with the knife.

52:30.356 --> 52:31.691
Take it all in.

52:39.198 --> 52:40.198
Okay.

52:46.581 --> 52:47.874
Get on top of him.

52:49.167 --> 52:50.751
Push your sex
into his stomach.

53:30.541 --> 53:31.626
All right.

53:35.004 --> 53:36.004
He'll do.

53:45.139 --> 53:46.241
What were you doing in there?

53:46.265 --> 53:47.265
Hi.

53:48.517 --> 53:49.517
Where'd you come from?

53:50.478 --> 53:51.854
I was just picking
root vegetables.

53:54.190 --> 53:55.900
Are you really
from Gartagnana?

53:56.192 --> 53:58.527
Yes, I'm really
from Gartagnana.

53:58.819 --> 53:59.904
Why do you keep asking me?

54:00.196 --> 54:01.316
You've asked me, like, 25...

54:01.489 --> 54:02.529
You are the most annoying!

54:06.535 --> 54:07.745
Are you ignoring me?

54:08.913 --> 54:10.498
No.

54:10.790 --> 54:12.470
- I feel like
you're ignoring me.
- I'm not.

54:15.753 --> 54:17.129
Can I ask you a question?

54:18.047 --> 54:19.047
Yes.

54:20.716 --> 54:22.301
Did last night
mean anything to you?

54:24.470 --> 54:25.763
No.

54:26.055 --> 54:27.974
We were just drunk
and having fun.

54:28.808 --> 54:30.476
Forget about it.

54:41.445 --> 54:42.571
All right.

54:42.863 --> 54:44.740
Masseto, Masseto, Masseto.

54:45.032 --> 54:46.409
I'm actually...

54:46.701 --> 54:47.827
I'm all right right now.

54:48.119 --> 54:49.161
Oh, all right.

54:49.453 --> 54:50.454
Yeah.

54:50.746 --> 54:51.747
How's it going?

54:52.039 --> 54:53.207
It was a good day.

54:53.499 --> 54:55.084
Yeah, I um...

54:55.376 --> 54:57.044
I don't know. I can kind of...

54:57.336 --> 54:59.714
I can kind of picture myself
maybe being here a while.

55:00.006 --> 55:01.924
Really? You think
you could stay on?

55:02.216 --> 55:04.093
If you'd have me, yeah.

55:04.385 --> 55:05.678
Are you kidding?

55:05.970 --> 55:08.097
That would solve
a lot of problems.

55:08.389 --> 55:10.641
And how's it going
with the sisters?
That's all right?

55:10.933 --> 55:12.727
I think they're
kind of warming up to me.

55:13.019 --> 55:15.062
Good. Good, good.
Not too much?

55:15.354 --> 55:16.897
No. Definitely...

55:17.189 --> 55:18.190
Definitely not too much.

55:18.482 --> 55:20.359
It's the right amount,
feels like.

55:20.651 --> 55:22.611
Anyway, let's have a toast,

55:22.903 --> 55:25.072
just a quick toast...

55:25.364 --> 55:26.884
And then maybe
head over to confession.

55:27.074 --> 55:28.634
- Yeah.
- You know, like we do.

55:28.868 --> 55:31.748
I think I'm good tonight,
just 'cause I'm gonna...
Feeling a little tired.

55:31.787 --> 55:33.098
- It's been a long day.
- All right, yeah.

55:33.122 --> 55:35.058
It's bad luck to put it
back in the pitcher, though...

55:35.082 --> 55:36.682
So, let's just
have this one, and then...

55:47.178 --> 55:48.387
Hello?

55:49.847 --> 55:51.390
Are you alone?

55:51.682 --> 55:53.201
- Of course.
- I thought I heard someone.

55:53.225 --> 55:55.227
No, no, no.
I was talking to myself.

55:55.519 --> 55:57.271
Let's take a little walk.

56:09.367 --> 56:11.327
Bishop Bartolomeo, hello.

56:11.619 --> 56:13.496
Father Tommasso.

56:13.788 --> 56:14.788
Ah, it's good to see you.

56:15.039 --> 56:16.457
Thank you.

56:16.749 --> 56:18.189
- Come in. Come in. Come in.
- Hello.

56:18.334 --> 56:20.134
Here. Let me take this.
You must be exhausted.

56:20.378 --> 56:21.458
Very tired, very long trip.

56:21.629 --> 56:22.629
So good to see you.

56:22.797 --> 56:24.048
So good to see you, too.

56:24.340 --> 56:25.340
Somewhat unexpected.

56:25.758 --> 56:26.801
Looks great.

56:28.386 --> 56:29.678
We'll get it together for you.

56:29.970 --> 56:31.514
Oh, yes,
I'm sure you will.

57:32.032 --> 57:33.200
Oh, shit!

58:01.645 --> 58:04.482
Knock-knock.
Are they not here?

58:04.773 --> 58:06.001
- They disappeared.
- Oh.

58:06.025 --> 58:08.402
And you know Alessandra,
Ilario's daughter?

58:08.694 --> 58:09.854
Ilario's daughter, of course.

58:09.904 --> 58:11.447
Hi.

58:11.947 --> 58:14.259
- His business is not doing
very well at the moment.
- Oh, that's terrible.

58:14.283 --> 58:15.283
Sorry to say, yeah.

58:15.534 --> 58:16.534
Yeah.

58:16.744 --> 58:17.744
I want one of those.

58:17.995 --> 58:19.038
We can get you one.

58:19.330 --> 58:20.450
Yes, it's yours, it's yours!

58:20.664 --> 58:22.684
- Thank you, Sister Alessandra.
- Thank you.

58:22.708 --> 58:24.060
- Nice to see you.
- We appreciate your time.

58:24.084 --> 58:25.770
And we all
went out to the field

58:25.794 --> 58:27.129
and worked on a single plot.

58:55.366 --> 58:56.492
I see your point,

58:56.784 --> 58:58.369
but I'd like you
to focus here.

58:58.661 --> 59:00.621
No, but I'm fine with March.

59:00.913 --> 59:03.624
In February, how did you
sell textiles before
they were sold?

59:03.916 --> 59:06.085
I like what you're saying,
and if you...

59:06.377 --> 59:08.671
No. But this is March.
I'm fine with March.

59:08.963 --> 59:11.799
Mother Marea, I need to talk
to you about Sister Fernanda.

59:12.091 --> 59:13.902
- Is she all right?
- Well, she's acting
very suspicious.

59:13.926 --> 59:15.445
And I've learned some things
I think you'd want to know.

59:15.469 --> 59:17.280
You know how she's been saying
that the donkey escaped?

59:17.304 --> 59:20.099
- It's not escaping.
- Okay, this is
not the right time.

59:20.391 --> 59:21.991
She's been lying about it
the whole time.

59:22.726 --> 59:25.020
She's lying about it.
You'll want to know about it.

59:25.312 --> 59:28.440
- I'm so sorry about that.
- Have you seen these numbers?
Who...

59:28.732 --> 59:30.943
I supervise in general...

59:31.235 --> 59:32.653
The numbers, but...

59:32.945 --> 59:34.545
There's something
going on with Fernanda.

59:34.572 --> 59:36.591
She said that she was going...

59:36.615 --> 59:39.335
- Sister, I'm asking,
please keep your voice down.
- She wasn't there!

59:39.743 --> 59:41.555
She was clearly lying.
She had a friend over,

59:41.579 --> 59:42.955
and she drank alcohol.

59:43.414 --> 59:46.054
- She's staying up!
I hear her up all night.
- Don't talk so much...

59:49.044 --> 59:50.814
She's clearly lying about
the donkey escaping.

59:50.838 --> 59:52.190
Why would she lie
about the donkey?

59:52.214 --> 59:54.025
I don't know why she's lying,
but I checked the walls,

59:54.049 --> 59:55.249
and I checked
all of the gates.

59:55.384 --> 59:56.695
There's no way
that donkey's escaping.

59:56.719 --> 59:58.947
I think that donkey
needs someone else
to take care of her.

59:58.971 --> 59:59.971
I can take care of her.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.683
I will consider it.

01:00:02.975 --> 01:00:04.855
- Thank you, Mother.
- We'll discuss this later.

01:00:06.812 --> 01:00:08.897
Isn't that amazing, Sisters?

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:10.566
That Rose had the ability

01:00:10.858 --> 01:00:15.613
to predict the exact day
of the death of Frederick II.

01:00:15.904 --> 01:00:20.284
I think we all have this
ability to connect
deeply with God.

01:00:20.576 --> 01:00:23.037
I share the story, because we
don't always listen to God.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.170
Hey!

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:16.131
What's going on?

01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:17.716
You can speak?

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:21.428
No, no. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.555
I heard you. I heard you!

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.182
Tell me what's going on
right now,

01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:28.018
or I'm gonna tell everyone
here that you've
been tricking us!

01:01:28.519 --> 01:01:30.599
All right, all right,
all right. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:01:30.979 --> 01:01:32.219
I'm not supposed to
talk to you.

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:33.592
You're not supposed to
talk to me?

01:01:33.649 --> 01:01:35.192
What does that even mean?

01:01:35.484 --> 01:01:37.695
Hello? Hello?

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:39.756
- Get down. Get down.
- Can you hear me?

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.699
Can you
hear me? Hello?

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:43.867
No,
you can't hear me.

01:01:44.159 --> 01:01:45.160
Can you hear my thoughts?

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:47.079
'Cause I can
hear your thoughts.

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:48.539
I can hear your thoughts.

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:51.332
Hi.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.490
This feels different.

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:25.492
I think I like sex with girls.

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:26.910
I never told anyone.

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:29.788
I have lots
of secrets. I'm Jewish.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.640
Nobody knows,
but now you know.

01:02:31.707 --> 01:02:33.667
But you don't know,
'cause you can't...

01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:34.959
There's the angels.

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:37.504
Do you see the angels?

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:40.632
- I see the...
Oh, I hear 'em. I hear 'em.

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:43.218
Oh, they know.
They know I'm here.
They know I'm here.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:44.720
Oh, God. Okay.

01:02:48.599 --> 01:02:49.975
What are you doing here?

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.102
I'm just looking
through the hay. Shh!

01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:40.835
- Fernanda!
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:42.444
Why is there blood
all over your face?

01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:43.736
Get out of my way!

01:03:44.655 --> 01:03:46.365
Fernanda? Fernanda?

01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:52.204
Over there. Come on.
They have the donkey.

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:57.875
Oh, jeez. Are you okay?

01:03:58.293 --> 01:03:59.378
Are you okay?

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:01.380
I'm gonna throw up.

01:04:01.672 --> 01:04:03.423
Okay, okay, okay. Let it out.

01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:05.300
I'm not gonna throw up.

01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:06.677
Okay, okay.

01:04:06.969 --> 01:04:09.012
Let's keep moving.
We're gonna keep going.

01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:11.056
- Keep going.
- I'm so hot. Why am I so hot?

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:13.148
- I don't know.
- Oh, I'm so thirsty.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:14.510
Gotta keep going.

01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:31.410
What is the lights?
Look at the lights.

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:39.042
What is it...

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:42.087
- I took the belladonna.
I took the belladonna.
- What?

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:45.173
She had it. She had
the sex, and so I was
gonna have the sex.

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:47.968
- So I did belladonna
so I could have the sex...

01:05:10.699 --> 01:05:11.992
Witches.

01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:13.869
They're witches!

01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:16.705
He's making a lot of noise.

01:05:16.997 --> 01:05:18.117
It's okay. He's a deaf-mute.

01:05:18.373 --> 01:05:19.642
Yeah, well, maybe
we should gag him.

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:21.306
There's no point.
He can't talk.

01:05:22.294 --> 01:05:23.712
Shut up.

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:33.680
Ginevra, no.

01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:35.849
Ginevra, come back here.

01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:37.809
Ginevra, get back here!

01:05:40.729 --> 01:05:41.813
Stop!

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:10.467
For so it was placed
when the goddess embraced.

01:06:10.759 --> 01:06:13.178
The horned lord, our god
who taught her the word.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.389
Which quickened the womb
and conquered the tomb.

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:29.569
Lance to grail,
spirit to flesh,

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:31.154
sun to moon.

01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:32.646
Forever your flame
is the male.

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:35.158
Don't fucking kill me.
No, don't, please.

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:36.844
Don't fucking kill me!
I'll do anything, please!

01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:39.079
- We cured him.
There's absolutely
no way.

01:06:39.371 --> 01:06:40.556
I'm telling you,
he was a deaf-mute.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.100
You know nothing.
This is a fertility ritual.

01:06:42.124 --> 01:06:43.476
You know,
I told you to gag him.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.353
- It'll be great
if you just listen next time.

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:47.921
Okay.

01:06:59.558 --> 01:07:01.226
What are you all looking at?

01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:04.688
Why are you
looking at me?

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.231
What is she doing here?

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:08.442
What?

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:22.247
Ginevra!

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:25.083
Calm down.
Put the totem down!

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:26.960
You do not belong here!

01:07:27.252 --> 01:07:28.252
Give it to me.

01:07:28.462 --> 01:07:29.462
You don't belong here!

01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:34.259
- No, No.
- You don't belong!

01:07:37.012 --> 01:07:39.723
Spirit to flesh,
sun to moon.

01:07:40.015 --> 01:07:41.015
Quiet.

01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:43.685
Fernanda! Stop this!

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:45.137
God, what are you doing here?

01:07:45.187 --> 01:07:46.229
I won't let you kill him!

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:48.483
Stop it, Alessandra!
I need to have sex with him!

01:07:49.191 --> 01:07:50.734
Why are you...

01:07:51.026 --> 01:07:52.694
Why are you even here?

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:54.714
- You don't know
the powers of...

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:07.167
You're a witch? This is crazy!

01:08:07.459 --> 01:08:09.059
And you were lying to us
this whole time?

01:08:09.336 --> 01:08:10.712
Yes, explain yourself!

01:08:11.004 --> 01:08:12.106
All right,
all right, all right.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:13.882
These people,
they want to kill me,

01:08:14.174 --> 01:08:15.174
and I went on the run...

01:08:15.217 --> 01:08:16.216
This is my donkey!

01:08:16.384 --> 01:08:17.594
She's trying to
take my donkey.

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:19.738
- We have to get her.
- She's out of control.

01:08:19.763 --> 01:08:21.843
- All right, let's...
- Enough with
the knife already.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.457
That fucking bitch.

01:08:53.255 --> 01:08:55.966
You need to know
what's going on!

01:08:56.258 --> 01:08:58.218
You need to know!

01:09:06.935 --> 01:09:08.478
Wake up!

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:10.689
Wake up! Wake up!

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.277
You need to know
what's going on!

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:17.209
Just a minute.
I'll be right there.

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:20.591
- What are you doing?
It's the middle of the night!
- They're witches!

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:22.242
They're witches!

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:23.594
You need to know
about the witches!

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:24.818
They're out there
in the woods!

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:27.098
- Put your clothes on.
- Fernanda's a witch,
her friend's a witch!

01:09:27.122 --> 01:09:28.765
- Calm down!
- They're all out there!
Father Bartolomeo,

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:30.270
you need to know.
There are witches...

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:32.127
She's a witch! She is a witch!

01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:33.939
- I am not a witch!
- Stop!

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:35.651
- You're just jealous.
- No, I am not!

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:37.191
Why are you wearing
your winter habit?

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:38.984
- I saw him first.
- Why is the handyman here?

01:09:39.009 --> 01:09:40.819
What do you mean,
you saw him first?
You don't even like men!

01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:42.203
You're sexually
attracted to women.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:43.805
I am sexually
attracted to men.

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:45.473
- What?
- I had sex with him!

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:47.410
- You are a bride of Christ!
- You did not
have sex with him.

01:09:47.434 --> 01:09:48.536
You were just writhing
around on him.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.960
- You had sex with him, too.
- Stop.

01:09:50.312 --> 01:09:52.952
- How dare you?
Bishop, I did not have sex.
- I'm telling the truth.

01:09:53.064 --> 01:09:54.125
Why are you
a tattletale, huh?

01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:55.751
I know what you're doing
and she's my donkey now!

01:09:55.775 --> 01:09:56.855
Don't talk about my donkey.

01:09:56.985 --> 01:09:57.985
I am on donkey duty now!

01:09:58.153 --> 01:09:59.153
What is wrong with her?

01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:00.447
She is on drugs!

01:10:00.739 --> 01:10:02.949
She told me
she took belladonna tonight,

01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:05.869
and she's been dancing
around naked in the
woods with witches.

01:10:06.161 --> 01:10:07.412
And she's a Jew!

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.877
I am not a Jew!

01:10:14.169 --> 01:10:15.629
Sister Marea!

01:10:15.921 --> 01:10:17.231
Stop talking.

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:18.256
I am not a Jew!

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:19.548
Yes! Stop. Stop.

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:21.968
Sister Marea!
Sister Marea! Wake up!

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.179
I'm not a Jew. I'm not a Jew.

01:10:24.471 --> 01:10:25.591
Come out here. Look at this.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:26.722
I was sleeping!

01:10:26.932 --> 01:10:28.391
- Complete chaos!
- I'm sorry.

01:10:28.683 --> 01:10:30.323
- Everyone's awake.
- What's on your face?

01:10:30.435 --> 01:10:32.716
It's the middle of the night.
There's a donkey downstairs.

01:10:32.771 --> 01:10:34.081
Why do you have
pants on your head?

01:10:34.105 --> 01:10:35.732
Okay, just please stop!

01:10:36.024 --> 01:10:38.276
I can explain everything,
all right? It's all my fault.

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:39.629
I thought you couldn't speak!

01:10:39.653 --> 01:10:40.820
He can speak.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:44.485
- Yeah, he can talk.
- I thought you were
a deaf-mute!

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:46.493
It's a miracle.

01:10:52.624 --> 01:10:54.834
We're going to
begin the tribunal.

01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:14.771
Sister Ginevra,
these are your sins.

01:11:15.063 --> 01:11:16.106
Ingestion of drugs,

01:11:16.398 --> 01:11:17.983
lying with a woman,

01:11:18.275 --> 01:11:19.276
not being baptized.

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:21.820
Not being baptized?

01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:24.447
That's what
makes you what you are.

01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:27.139
You can't... You shouldn't
even be coming
through those doors!

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:31.871
Being a busybody,
filthy conversation...

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:34.833
Vain jangling, drinking...

01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:36.418
Eating blood.

01:11:41.381 --> 01:11:43.662
Do you think I've ever written
down "Eating blood" before?

01:11:44.384 --> 01:11:46.219
Where am I?

01:11:46.511 --> 01:11:49.931
Envy, fornication,
homosexuality...

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:51.703
That's the same
as lying with a woman,

01:11:51.766 --> 01:11:52.767
but we separate those.

01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:55.353
Lustfulness, reveling,

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:57.188
mischief in your heart.

01:11:59.566 --> 01:12:01.192
That's the longest list
I've ever had...

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:02.484
For sins.

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:05.113
Please have mercy on me.

01:12:05.405 --> 01:12:06.632
For your punishment,

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.216
I'm going to have you
fast for one year.

01:12:08.783 --> 01:12:10.035
Okay.

01:12:10.327 --> 01:12:12.787
- I didn't explain it yet,
so it's not okay.
- Okay.

01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:15.415
Because a human being
can't live on not eating.

01:12:15.707 --> 01:12:17.810
- No.
- I don't mean you're not gonna
eat for a whole year.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:20.295
You just pick a meal
in the day

01:12:20.587 --> 01:12:22.756
- and skip it.
- Okay.

01:12:23.048 --> 01:12:25.592
So, say, it's lunch.
Every day, you've got to
skip lunch.

01:12:25.884 --> 01:12:27.344
- Yes.
- And what meal is that?

01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:29.637
Uh...

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:32.474
Based on your suggestion,
I'll skip lunch.

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:36.853
It's not my suggestion.

01:12:37.145 --> 01:12:38.145
You have to feel the sin.

01:12:38.355 --> 01:12:39.356
I can feel lunch.

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:41.191
Sister Alessandra.

01:12:42.192 --> 01:12:43.693
You know...

01:12:43.985 --> 01:12:45.487
I'm friends with your father,

01:12:45.779 --> 01:12:47.405
and now his daughter
is doing this?

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:49.824
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:52.577
It's embarrassing.

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:56.039
For me, I'm embarrassed.
How do you think he's gonna
feel when he knows this?

01:12:56.331 --> 01:12:57.499
Please don't tell my father.

01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:00.102
- There's no need
to tell my father.
- He's a patron of the church,

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:01.126
one of the biggest.

01:13:03.088 --> 01:13:05.590
And this place is
completely in disrepair.
It's falling apart.

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:07.884
It looks like a barn
in Filicaia.

01:13:09.594 --> 01:13:11.346
Have you been there?

01:13:11.638 --> 01:13:13.078
- It's disgusting.
- It's disgusting!

01:13:13.264 --> 01:13:14.933
Please, please don't say that.

01:13:15.225 --> 01:13:17.185
I think I want to call
this place Little Filicaia.

01:13:17.227 --> 01:13:18.496
- No, please.
- I might.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.688
Sister Fernanda,
these are your sins.

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:22.816
Apostasy,

01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:24.609
heresy,

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:27.021
- abusive language...
- It's just the tone
of my voice.

01:13:27.237 --> 01:13:28.488
Homosexuality...

01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:32.117
Revelings, witchcraft.

01:13:33.827 --> 01:13:34.827
Did you roll your eyes?

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:35.911
No.

01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:38.998
You were rolling your eyes.

01:13:40.792 --> 01:13:43.086
Sister Marea,
I don't know what to say.

01:13:43.378 --> 01:13:45.046
I am shocked.

01:13:45.338 --> 01:13:47.590
Fornication?
Living in pleasure?

01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:50.343
You, Sister Marea, you.

01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:52.303
Loving the world?

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:53.847
Why don't you just stay here?

01:13:54.139 --> 01:13:56.391
Why don't you stay in this
world that you love so much?

01:13:56.683 --> 01:13:57.851
Isn't it fun?

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:01.187
Do you have
anything to say?

01:14:01.479 --> 01:14:03.231
I'm so sorry, Your Holiness.

01:14:03.857 --> 01:14:05.358
Do you care?

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:09.487
It's just complete lack of...

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.139
Are you guys
smiling at each other?

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:14.325
Can you have a moment
to not look at each other?

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:15.702
You're both out of control.

01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:19.789
Father Tommasso...

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:21.361
I don't even know
where to begin.

01:14:23.293 --> 01:14:24.502
I ask your forgiveness...

01:14:26.421 --> 01:14:28.715
And I ask God's forgiveness

01:14:29.007 --> 01:14:31.468
for failing as the
shepherd of this flock.

01:14:31.759 --> 01:14:35.722
I only ask that you please not
punish the sisters of this
convent for my failings.

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:43.020
Marea.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:46.940
I'm so sorry.

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:50.528
He's taken away my priesthood.

01:14:52.363 --> 01:14:55.742
I have to go to San Biagio
and become a monk.

01:14:56.034 --> 01:14:57.660
I'm so sorry
for dragging you into this.

01:14:57.952 --> 01:14:59.832
You're a good woman.
You're a good woman, Marea.

01:15:01.247 --> 01:15:02.967
- I should...
- What the hell are you doing?

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:05.919
Get outta here!

01:15:06.211 --> 01:15:07.670
You were just crying in there?

01:15:09.172 --> 01:15:11.382
What's wrong with you?

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.510
Was lying
with Francesca worth it?

01:15:13.801 --> 01:15:15.241
I really don't
want to talk about it.

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:17.597
What about that bosom?
Very ample.

01:15:17.889 --> 01:15:20.350
Super ample,
plus it's Bruno's wife,

01:15:20.642 --> 01:15:22.310
so it had to be so intense.

01:15:22.602 --> 01:15:23.937
Can you guys
please stop talking?

01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:25.709
You heard
what happened to her, right?

01:15:25.897 --> 01:15:27.297
No.
How could I have heard?

01:15:34.572 --> 01:15:36.616
"At the end
of the cold season,

01:15:36.908 --> 01:15:38.701
"when along the branch

01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:42.747
"surges the sap that revives
the broom and heather.

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:46.543
"When the peach trees
blossom and the frog
sings in the pool

01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:48.920
"and the willow
and elder grow,

01:15:49.212 --> 01:15:51.756
"as I see the dry months come,

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:54.008
"I concern myself
with a large orchard

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.636
"where there are beautiful
saplings in many places.

01:15:58.346 --> 01:16:01.182
"The grafts are large,
and the fruit fleshy

01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:04.018
"on those that should
be the worst.

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:06.145
"And the blossoms
look like those of apples."

01:16:07.772 --> 01:16:09.816
"But when the fruit comes,

01:16:10.108 --> 01:16:11.859
"it is nothing but
willow and elder.

01:16:14.571 --> 01:16:17.448
"And since the head is empty,
the members at the ends
are in pain."

01:16:34.007 --> 01:16:35.883
Did you finish
cleaning the cellar?

01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:37.175
Yeah, all done.

01:16:38.886 --> 01:16:40.305
Isn't it so annoying?

01:16:40.597 --> 01:16:41.931
- So annoying.
- I told you.

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:44.850
I know.

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:53.775
Sorry I told on you.

01:16:55.612 --> 01:16:58.948
Sorry that I told Mother Marea
every time I thought

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.409
something wasn't right
or weird.

01:17:03.578 --> 01:17:05.246
Sorry I ruined your ritual.

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.834
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
I was a witch.

01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:14.172
But honestly,

01:17:14.464 --> 01:17:17.258
I thought eventually I could
turn you all into witches,

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:20.595
and you'd join my coven,
but I know that sounds stupid.

01:17:20.887 --> 01:17:22.388
You really think
I could be a witch?

01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:26.434
Yeah.

01:17:34.359 --> 01:17:35.759
Do you think
they're gonna kill him?

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:44.577
I don't know what's going on
with Giovanni lately.

01:17:44.869 --> 01:17:47.598
Have you noticed
the carrots they're serving
the soldiers are mushier?

01:17:47.622 --> 01:17:49.502
I was saying
the same thing yesterday.

01:17:49.624 --> 01:17:51.984
I would even be okay
if they were mushy
on the outside

01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:54.396
and crispy on the inside.
I don't need,
like, a full crisp, but...

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:56.273
It could be
a little mushy. I'm fine
with a little mush.

01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:57.566
'Cause this is
basically carrot pudding.

01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:58.633
Where is he?

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:10.436
Welcome back.

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:18.319
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
I've been in Sarzana

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:20.446
meeting with the family
of my new bride.

01:18:21.948 --> 01:18:23.449
Beautiful young lady

01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:25.910
who seems like
she might be up to fidelity.

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:27.286
Imagine that.

01:18:28.121 --> 01:18:31.165
Once she hits puberty.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:35.128
I have to thank you for doing
me an incredible favor.

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:38.965
My wife, who had hidden
her Guelph ancestry,

01:18:39.257 --> 01:18:40.925
turned out to be

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:43.094
quite the barren twat.

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:44.762
And you've given me
every reason

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:47.223
to seal her up in a wall
with a boar and a dog.

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:51.436
I've got some good news

01:18:51.728 --> 01:18:52.937
and some bad news.

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:54.564
Which would you
like first?

01:18:54.856 --> 01:18:56.315
I don't care.

01:18:58.192 --> 01:19:00.752
The good news is
I'm going to keep you alive
for as long as I can.

01:19:01.529 --> 01:19:03.865
It sounds cheery.
The bad news is

01:19:04.157 --> 01:19:06.492
it's only so that
I can inflict as much pain

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:09.996
and degradation
as I torture your flesh.

01:19:10.288 --> 01:19:12.582
I'm having
a hard time determining

01:19:12.874 --> 01:19:14.417
which of my favorite
torture methods

01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:16.210
to start with upon you.

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:19.464
Got the thumbscrew.
I have a Catherine wheel.

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:21.340
I have a rack out back.

01:19:21.632 --> 01:19:23.301
It was taking up
too much space in here,

01:19:23.593 --> 01:19:25.595
but still fully functional.

01:19:25.887 --> 01:19:27.513
There's a new one
called the rat box

01:19:27.805 --> 01:19:29.766
just in from Sicily.

01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:31.684
The rat box,
not to be confused with

01:19:31.976 --> 01:19:33.644
what I call
my wife's private area

01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:34.976
after you'd been to visit.

01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:38.274
It's a box of rats
with one open side

01:19:38.566 --> 01:19:39.984
placed against your abdomen.

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:43.070
I light a fire on
the other side of the box,

01:19:43.362 --> 01:19:45.239
so that the rats,
in their attempts to escape,

01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:48.159
burrow through your guts.

01:19:48.451 --> 01:19:50.703
Anyway, we'll have
a lot of fun together

01:19:50.995 --> 01:19:53.706
in the coming days
and maybe weeks,

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:55.500
depending on
how tough you are.

01:19:58.169 --> 01:19:59.670
Don't go anywhere.

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:05.467
Shit.

01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:13.935
There was no good news
in that at all.

01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:18.064
Hey, um... I'd actually...

01:20:18.356 --> 01:20:20.000
I'd really appreciate it
if you guys let me out now.

01:20:20.024 --> 01:20:21.024
Oh.

01:20:21.234 --> 01:20:22.234
Can't do that to us.

01:20:22.401 --> 01:20:23.986
- Please.
- It's a tough position.

01:20:24.278 --> 01:20:25.738
Hey, hey,
we're friends, all right?

01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:27.310
You don't want
to be here either.

01:20:27.365 --> 01:20:29.033
Just let me out.
We'll make a run for it.

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:31.369
- I...
- We can't.

01:20:31.661 --> 01:20:33.037
He can't make a run
for anything.

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:35.540
If I die,
that's on your conscience.

01:20:35.832 --> 01:20:37.112
You don't want to live
with that.

01:20:37.375 --> 01:20:38.375
Please.

01:20:38.626 --> 01:20:39.669
What... Is...

01:20:39.961 --> 01:20:42.547
Okay. You're gonna have
to move quick,

01:20:42.839 --> 01:20:44.173
especially around the moat.

01:20:44.465 --> 01:20:46.151
The guards out there
have a real thirst for blood.

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:48.553
Yes, of course.
Thank you so much.

01:20:48.845 --> 01:20:49.887
- Okay, here I go.
- Okay.

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:52.014
I'm unlocking you.

01:20:54.141 --> 01:20:55.726
What are you...

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:57.830
There's a turtle
with a candle on it!

01:20:57.854 --> 01:20:59.021
Really?

01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:00.749
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't leave me!

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:02.334
Hey, where are you going?
Don't leave me!

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:06.362
Come on! Just please.
Stop, you shits!

01:21:06.654 --> 01:21:08.294
- Let's see what he does.
- Shit.

01:21:25.256 --> 01:21:26.424
What are you doing here?

01:21:26.716 --> 01:21:28.384
We're getting you out. Hi.

01:21:33.598 --> 01:21:34.598
Come on!

01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:38.728
Come on. Come on.

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:40.938
Whoa, whoa. Come on!

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:42.857
No, no, it's okay.
I'm giving it to you.

01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:44.901
You can trust us.

01:21:45.192 --> 01:21:46.736
We're rescuing you!

01:21:47.028 --> 01:21:49.363
I embroidered this doll
to put in your place.

01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:51.775
We brought you a lunar habit
to hide you in the night.

01:21:51.908 --> 01:21:53.508
We want to bring you back
to the convent.

01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:58.664
All right.

01:21:58.956 --> 01:21:59.956
All right, let's go.

01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:01.124
I'm gonna need that back.

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:02.450
Put on the habit.
Key. Oh, key!

01:22:09.634 --> 01:22:11.135
Okay. All right.

01:22:12.678 --> 01:22:14.305
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

01:22:20.561 --> 01:22:22.881
You think this has something
to do with our hair being cut?

01:22:25.524 --> 01:22:27.526
You think we should tell Bruno
about that?

01:22:27.818 --> 01:22:31.739
He's got his hands full
with the wife in the wall
and everything.

01:22:32.031 --> 01:22:35.201
We just saw the wildest thing.
You would not believe it.

01:22:36.827 --> 01:22:38.204
Well, it was a turtle...

01:22:44.752 --> 01:22:45.752
Come on.

01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:21.247
Hello.

01:23:21.539 --> 01:23:23.207
Tommasso.

01:23:24.125 --> 01:23:25.325
How are things at the convent?

01:23:27.795 --> 01:23:29.088
It's lonely.

01:23:31.382 --> 01:23:34.427
That monastery is so boring.

01:23:37.263 --> 01:23:38.889
All we do is pray.

01:23:40.307 --> 01:23:41.767
I mean, it's important, but...

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:45.146
It's all men.

01:23:46.397 --> 01:23:48.065
It's so good to see your face.

01:23:57.158 --> 01:23:59.318
Someone's coming.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:07.752
Come on!

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:11.630
Come on.

01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:23.934
They're gone.

01:24:37.114 --> 01:24:38.274
All right, come on.
