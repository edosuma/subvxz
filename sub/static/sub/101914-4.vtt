committed by the Inners
against innocent Belters.

41:14.681 --> 41:18.059
No longer will Belters
be persecuted

41:18.059 --> 41:21.062
and subjected to the savagery
and inhumanity

41:21.062 --> 41:23.190
that the Inners
have been poisoning

41:23.190 --> 41:25.775
our species with.

41:25.775 --> 41:28.153
Any further attacks

41:28.153 --> 41:29.779
on Earth and Mars

41:29.779 --> 41:32.282
will be precipitated
by the inner planets' failure

41:32.282 --> 41:36.369
to recognize
this new human reality.

41:36.369 --> 41:39.789
The Free Navy now possesses
the last remaining sample

41:39.789 --> 41:41.499
of the protomolecule.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.376
Any transgressions
by the Inners,

41:43.376 --> 41:45.503
and the Free Navy
will not hesitate

41:45.503 --> 41:48.089
to unleash the protomolecule
on either planet.

41:48.089 --> 41:52.719
We recognize the right
of Earth and Mars to exist,

41:52.719 --> 41:54.387
but their sovereignty ends

41:54.387 --> 41:56.848
at their respective
atmospheres.

41:56.848 --> 41:59.893
The vacuum, the Ring Gates,
and the Ring Worlds

41:59.893 --> 42:03.063
belong to the Belt,
to Belters.

42:03.063 --> 42:07.901
With the opening
of the alien gates,

42:07.901 --> 42:11.404
we are at a crossroads
in human history.

42:11.404 --> 42:15.283
Already, we are seeing
how easy it would be

42:15.283 --> 42:18.036
to carry on legacies
of exploitation,

42:18.036 --> 42:21.122
injustice, prejudice,
and oppression

42:21.122 --> 42:23.041
into the new worlds,

42:23.041 --> 42:24.876
but there is a better path.

42:24.876 --> 42:28.380
Under the protection
of the Free Navy,

42:28.380 --> 42:30.840
the society and culture
of the Belt

42:30.840 --> 42:35.053
will begin again
and remake humanity

42:35.053 --> 42:38.181
without the corruption,
greed, and hatred

42:38.181 --> 42:41.393
that the inner planets
could not transcend.

42:41.393 --> 42:43.687
We will take
what is ours by right, yes,

42:43.687 --> 42:46.731
but more than that,
we will lead the Belt

42:46.731 --> 42:50.026
to a new, better form,

42:50.026 --> 42:52.821
a more human form.

42:52.821 --> 42:55.907
Citizens of the Belt,

42:55.907 --> 43:01.079
baratnas, rise up now

43:01.079 --> 43:04.624
in joy and glorious resolve.

43:04.624 --> 43:08.044
This day is ours.

43:08.044 --> 43:10.755
Tomorrow is ours.

43:10.755 --> 43:14.884
The future of humanity
is ours.

43:14.884 --> 43:19.639
Today and forevermore...

43:19.639 --> 43:21.683
we are free.
