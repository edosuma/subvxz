WEBVTT

00:07.841 --> 00:10.544
ANNOUNCER: The Weekly.
All new, Sundays at 10:00
on FX.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.614
(dance music)

00:13.714 --> 00:16.084
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Pose.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.821
(cheering, applause)

00:20.854 --> 00:23.657
PRAY TELL: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.160
Pay attention!

00:26.194 --> 00:28.829
Okay. Okay, goddamn it.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.832
Fashionable Femme Queens, honey.

00:31.865 --> 00:35.503
This is the category
of the hour.

00:35.536 --> 00:39.006
These fanciful fashionistas
are showing you

00:39.039 --> 00:41.709
exactly what they are worth.

00:41.742 --> 00:45.279
Maybe you might be moved
to step your look

00:45.313 --> 00:47.515
all the way up.

00:47.548 --> 00:51.219
Oh! Oh, shoot!

00:51.252 --> 00:55.689
Oh, come on, Miss Lulu Ferocity.

00:55.723 --> 00:59.127
What you got yourself
cooking up on tonight?

00:59.160 --> 01:01.729
I can tell something's going on.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.232
She said "Oh, oh,"
she said, "hold on a minute."

01:04.265 --> 01:07.067
She said "Hold on a minute,
I got a thing to do."

01:07.101 --> 01:09.637
What are you doing?
What are you serving us?

01:09.670 --> 01:12.540
Oh! Oh!

01:12.573 --> 01:14.742
-Oh!
-(cheering)

01:14.775 --> 01:17.378
Yes, mama!

01:17.411 --> 01:21.282
Yes! Just a vision in lavender.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.750
Realness.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.752
Uh-huh.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.154
Come on, now. Oh.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.456
Spin-da, Spin-da, Spin-da-rella.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.491
Spinning that into butter.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.161
You know what? She don't need
no scores tonight.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.329
Just give that bitch her trophy,

01:35.363 --> 01:37.931
and go on and collect that skirt
for my closet.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.767
That's my sister!

01:39.800 --> 01:41.502
-Ow!
-Look at Miss Candy.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.505
She all happy.
Good for you, girl.

01:44.538 --> 01:48.008
Ferocity got themselves
a trophy.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.644
That's a good thing.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.781
Now, this is the level
I'm-a need y'all to bring

01:53.814 --> 01:56.917
to the inaugural Eros Ball.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.653
Eros is the god of love.

01:59.687 --> 02:03.691
So house mothers and fathers,
I need you to tell your spawns

02:03.724 --> 02:06.527
to spread L-O-V-E

02:06.560 --> 02:08.629
in the form
of some sickening looks.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.264
Y'all like that, right?

02:10.298 --> 02:12.700
And Miss Elektra, bravo.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.203
You certainly know
how to upgrade a house.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.471
-Ha, ha.
-Uh, quit it, bitch.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.807
You only been here a few weeks.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.943
A praise for one
is a praise for all.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.845
Even that wardrobe? You know,

02:24.878 --> 02:27.648
that fur collection has expanded
since our Abundance days.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.016
CANDY:
Where the coin coming from?

02:29.049 --> 02:30.318
Indochine don't pay that much

02:30.351 --> 02:31.652
for you to walk your ass
to a table.

02:31.685 --> 02:32.853
Speaking of work,

02:32.886 --> 02:34.788
I'm covering the late shift.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.657
Girl, it's midnight.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.626
Doesn't Indochine close
at 11:00?

02:38.659 --> 02:40.461
How would you know?

02:40.494 --> 02:41.862
We'd never let
the likes of you in.

02:41.895 --> 02:42.963
Love you, too, bitch.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.998
*

02:46.367 --> 02:48.502
-Congratulations, girl.
-Save your well wishes

02:48.536 --> 02:51.505
for someone in need
of validation, hag.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.508
*

03:01.849 --> 03:03.851
(indistinct chatter)

03:09.357 --> 03:11.359
*

03:18.198 --> 03:21.235
* Shiny, shiny *

03:21.269 --> 03:24.838
* Shiny boots of leather *

03:24.872 --> 03:29.277
* Whiplash girl-child
in the dark *

03:29.310 --> 03:32.212
(whips cracking, grunting)

03:32.246 --> 03:34.114
* Comes in bells *

03:34.147 --> 03:38.452
* Your servant,
don't forsake him *

03:38.486 --> 03:40.354
* Strike, dear mistress *

03:40.388 --> 03:43.056
* And cure his heart *

03:43.090 --> 03:45.058
PAUL:
Mistress Elektra, is that you?

03:45.092 --> 03:46.694
Who the fuck do you
think it is, Paul?

03:46.727 --> 03:47.928
Of course it's me.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.765
Ow! Ah!

03:51.799 --> 03:53.434
I'm sorry, Mistress.
I'm an idiot.

03:53.467 --> 03:56.937
I'm a-- I'm a worthless piece
of shit. (pants)

03:56.970 --> 03:59.139
Yes, you are.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.409
And you appear to have helped
yourself to my wardrobe.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.277
Uh, the panties are mine.

04:03.311 --> 04:04.778
I just couldn't resist
trying on your heels.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.615
(groans)

04:07.648 --> 04:09.116
You like giving your power
to women,

04:09.149 --> 04:10.284
-don't you?
-Uh-huh.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.152
You disgust me!

04:12.185 --> 04:13.721
I disgust myself, Mistress.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.457
(moaning)

04:16.490 --> 04:19.627
I bet you wouldn't last a day
in my pumps.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.762
The adversities I've faced
would cripple you.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.832
-Get up!
-(grunts)

04:27.635 --> 04:30.270
You can't even stand,
you pathetic creature.

04:30.304 --> 04:33.841
Stay right there.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.318
What is that?

04:44.352 --> 04:46.420
Amyl nitrate.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.288
You wanna try?

04:48.322 --> 04:51.592
I do not do drugs,
nor do I approve of them.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.294
No, no, no, this-this and
a little coke... (sniffs)

04:54.328 --> 04:56.930
it'll keep me going all night.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.166
You charge by the hour,
don't you?

05:00.834 --> 05:03.070
Fine.

05:07.741 --> 05:08.809
Holy shit!

05:08.842 --> 05:10.210
I can't believe I finally found

05:10.243 --> 05:11.979
a career that truly fits me.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.647
Four days a week
and I'm already making more

05:13.681 --> 05:15.215
than I've made
in my entire life.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.984
So does that mean
you're finally gonna ditch

05:17.017 --> 05:18.386
that job at Indochine?

05:18.419 --> 05:20.187
I don't see why I can't do both.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.822
Working here brings in
the money,

05:21.855 --> 05:23.657
and working there keeps my name
on the lips

05:23.691 --> 05:24.992
of the rich and famous.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.894
Business is booming since AIDS.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.161
ZEDLEY:
She's right.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.663
Hand jobs replaced blow jobs.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.999
No one could pay their bills.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.802
Sometimes I feel bad
for these guys.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.137
Too scared to feel pleasure,
so they turn to pain.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.006
I never feel bad for a man.

05:39.039 --> 05:42.142
All I know is for the first time
in a long time,

05:42.175 --> 05:43.877
I feel great.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.379
Keep that attitude.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.047
-It'll make you rich.
-(Elektra laughs)

05:47.080 --> 05:48.549
Amen.
(imitates whip cracking)

05:50.751 --> 05:52.720
(door opens)

05:52.753 --> 05:54.855
(footfalls approach)

05:54.888 --> 05:57.324
PRAY TELL:
The category is...

05:57.357 --> 06:00.728
Live...

06:00.761 --> 06:03.030
Work...

06:03.063 --> 06:06.767
Pose!

06:08.402 --> 06:10.404
*

06:30.824 --> 06:32.593
(chuckles)

06:32.626 --> 06:34.528
What?

06:34.562 --> 06:37.064
Angel, don't try me.
This is my primo look.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.432
Exactly.

06:38.466 --> 06:40.934
-Come sit over here.
-(scoffs)

06:43.937 --> 06:46.373
You tryna get into
the beauty industry.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.708
-And?
-Uh-huh.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.376
Ain't no way you getting anybody

06:49.409 --> 06:50.911
to give you a storefront
if they clock you.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.646
You know that.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.048
You're selling a fantasy
right now.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.550
Well, not everyone
is lucky enough to be born

06:56.584 --> 06:58.218
with perfect bone structure,
honey.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.454
I appreciate my privileges,
but that don't mean

07:00.488 --> 07:02.089
you gotta make things harder
for yourself, ma.

07:02.122 --> 07:05.058
-Look at this, girl. Come on.
-What?

07:05.092 --> 07:09.062
Not to be rude,
but you got shit style.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.931
It's easy for you to judge.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.667
How many ladies' dressing rooms
you been kicked out of?

07:13.701 --> 07:16.003
I grab what I can off the rack
and get out of Dodge

07:16.036 --> 07:17.671
before someone calls security.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.007
I don't know if anything
fits right or looks good

07:20.040 --> 07:22.476
until I get home,
and by then it's too late.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.645
-I never thought about that.
-Yeah, well,

07:24.678 --> 07:27.447
I gave up being fashionable
a long time ago because of it.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.449
A woman don't need
to walk in a room

07:29.483 --> 07:32.285
and tell everybody that she
a woman. Less is more.

07:32.319 --> 07:35.155
I'm gonna show you how
to do your makeup.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.657
We are throwing...

07:36.690 --> 07:38.458
-these rags...
-What?

07:38.492 --> 07:40.293
-away.
-This is my good shirt.

07:40.327 --> 07:41.662
And we are getting you...

07:41.695 --> 07:44.464
proper high fashion.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.099
(chuckles)

07:46.133 --> 07:48.802
And you're gonna get yourself
that storefront.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.104
Mama's gotta pay the rent, girl.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.306
You are gonna make
an excellent mother.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.342
Oh, I know.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.994
Clark, keep the car running;
this won't take long.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.496
Hi, Ms. Norman?
I'm Blanca Rodriguez.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.666
I'm...
I'm the prospective tenant.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.301
-Are you a PR? Puerto Rican?
-No, I'm American.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.804
I'm sure, but where is your
family from? Your lineage?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.305
I'm Dominican.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.007
Good.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.809
Let's go in.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.378
I don't normally rent to anyone
darker than my Aunt Lilly

08:31.411 --> 08:33.480
after a week's vacation
in Palm Beach,

08:33.513 --> 08:35.482
but I've had good luck
with Dominicans.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.885
Hard workers for the most part.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.588
Well, that's me in a nutshell,
Mrs. Norman.

08:40.621 --> 08:44.124
I plan on making this into
my own nail salon. I-- Oh.

08:46.760 --> 08:51.264
I already got a-a-a loyal
customer base from my last job.

08:51.298 --> 08:54.835
May I say whoever does your
nails does an excellent job.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.369
It's Ms. Norman.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.371
I'm recently divorced.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.407
He was half a fag.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.677
I walked in on him bent over
a Vitra Grand chair

09:03.711 --> 09:05.679
getting plowed by our doorman.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.180
It must have been very painful.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.849
Life is pain for women.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.751
That's why we're tougher,
and better

09:10.784 --> 09:14.888
at being mean when the time
comes, and I was mean.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.290
Whatever that doorman did to him
was nothing compared

09:17.324 --> 09:19.960
to the reaming I gave old
Randy Norman in divorce court.

09:19.993 --> 09:24.464
This building is one of many
that ended up in my pocket.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.967
It's very special.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.936
I got plans to maybe even
put a tanning bed

09:28.969 --> 09:30.804
in back once I save up enough.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.806
It's not special,
it's a shithole.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.442
But I see the future:
gentrification.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.077
Do you know what that means?

09:37.110 --> 09:38.779
I'm up on most of the newest
beauty techniques,

09:38.812 --> 09:40.580
but I'm not sure
I've ever heard of that one.

09:40.614 --> 09:43.751
-New York is changing, Brenda.
-Blanca.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.920
By the year 2000, there won't be
a neighborhood in this city

09:46.954 --> 09:49.957
where a normal person feels
uncomfortable walking.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.759
When you make a neighborhood
safe and desirable,

09:51.792 --> 09:54.394
good people move in
and make it too expensive

09:54.427 --> 09:56.730
for the troublemakers
so they move out.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.231
Property values go up.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.466
Everybody wins.

09:59.499 --> 10:00.801
Well, I like winning.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.007
(Blanca clears throat)

10:08.676 --> 10:10.143
First and last month's rent

10:10.177 --> 10:12.012
-plus a security deposit.
-Okay.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.115
(clears throat)
Do you take cash?

10:15.148 --> 10:17.250
Preferred, actually.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.119
For tax purposes.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.988
Where did you come into
that much cash?

10:21.021 --> 10:22.823
You're not into crack, are you?

10:22.856 --> 10:25.425
No. I told you,
I have a loyal customer base.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.661
I've been saving for this for
over a year. It's my dream.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.864
Wait, I...

10:30.898 --> 10:32.465
Don't we need a contract
or something?

10:32.499 --> 10:34.434
Best if we just do it
all over a handshake.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.805
You will save plenty in taxes
and insurance, trust me.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.807
I'll come by at the end
of the month for my envelope.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.974
I prefer larger bills.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.142
Wait, so you mean this is mine?

10:42.175 --> 10:43.276
No. It's mine.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.945
Never forget that.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.479
No, I'm sorry. I mean,

10:46.513 --> 10:48.448
is the storefront mine
to use as my salon?

10:48.481 --> 10:49.950
Yes. Are you dumb?

10:49.983 --> 10:51.618
You didn't strike me as dumb.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.121
No. No, I'm not dumb.
I just--

10:54.154 --> 10:55.622
This was a dream of mine
that I didn't dare

10:55.655 --> 10:57.224
speak out loud
and now I'm too scared

10:57.257 --> 10:59.159
-to believe that it's even real.
-It's real.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.194
-Don't blow it.
-Oh.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.365
(exclaims, laughs)

11:22.182 --> 11:24.184
(chuckles)

11:28.722 --> 11:30.390
What the hell? Damon?

11:30.423 --> 11:32.425
DAMON:
Over here.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.865
(laughs)

11:41.368 --> 11:43.336
Mm.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.872
What's with all the hearts?

11:44.905 --> 11:47.007
Valentine's Day
was two months ago.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.878
I'm testing out these
decorations for the Eros Ball.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.846
What? Hmm?

11:52.880 --> 11:54.948
I need an excuse
to make love to you?

11:54.982 --> 11:57.317
No. Mm-mm.

11:58.651 --> 12:01.221
And what's with the,
the curtains?

12:01.254 --> 12:05.092
'Cause I knew we needed...
privacy.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.228
I'll be quick then.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.630
(chuckles)

12:10.663 --> 12:12.866
No, I mean, you know...

12:12.900 --> 12:15.035
Oh, I am so sorry, boys.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.236
Hey, Ricky, welcome back.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.871
-(chuckles) Hi.
-Can you knock?

12:17.905 --> 12:19.239
BLANCA:
Can y'all go put on
some clothes?

12:19.272 --> 12:21.041
I need ya to come into
the living room.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.375
It's a family meeting. Now.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.877
DAMON:
Can it wait?

12:23.911 --> 12:27.280
No. Derek died.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.651
(exhales)

12:31.684 --> 12:33.686
*

12:55.708 --> 12:57.310
Oh, my.

12:57.344 --> 13:00.147
Are you trying to wake
the dead from their slumber?

13:00.180 --> 13:01.748
Angel has been helping me
with my new look.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.983
-Stop it.
-(chuckles softly)

13:03.016 --> 13:04.417
What you think?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.753
If I liked it any more,
I'd be straight.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.088
-Ooh.
-(laughter)

13:08.121 --> 13:09.356
Then the dead would awaken.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.790
(gasps)

13:10.824 --> 13:12.659
NURSE JUDY:
You haven't come in

13:12.692 --> 13:13.861
for your follow-up visit.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.795
Are you doing okay
on those meds?

13:15.829 --> 13:17.664
Blanca?

13:17.697 --> 13:19.766
Why aren't you taking
those meds?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.634
I'm afraid of the side effects.

13:21.668 --> 13:24.104
I told you-- we're gonna
monitor you very closely.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.438
I don't know what it is, okay?

13:25.472 --> 13:26.974
I've been studying
that bottle every day.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.275
I've been looking
at the pills in my hands,

13:28.308 --> 13:29.843
-and I...
-(sighs)

13:29.877 --> 13:32.112
But I just can't take them.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.680
Is part of the reason
you're not taking them

13:33.713 --> 13:35.782
'cause you feel
like you don't deserve them?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.517
No.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.787
Part of me feels like maybe I
deserve this disease, you know?

13:40.820 --> 13:43.323
I sound crazy, right?

13:43.356 --> 13:45.859
No. When you're surrounded
by all this death,

13:45.893 --> 13:48.528
of course you might feel guilty
about surviving.

13:48.561 --> 13:49.796
But you can't give in.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.132
All right, can you two stop
keeping secrets?

13:52.165 --> 13:54.734
Now, Angel told me
that you went uptown

13:54.767 --> 13:56.803
to meet
that real estate man-eater.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.471
How did it go?

13:58.505 --> 14:00.473
Bitch is in the Post every day.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.575
Does she really have fangs
like everybody says?

14:02.609 --> 14:04.577
-(chuckling)
-No, but she got
a set of claws on her.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.346
That woman is scary as all hell.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.847
But...

14:07.881 --> 14:09.682
she gave me the space anyway.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.684
-Oh, my God.
-We'll be open for business

14:11.718 --> 14:13.420
-by the end of the month.
-(Lil Papi chuckles)

14:13.453 --> 14:16.156
Listen, I don't know
if it's because I passed,

14:16.189 --> 14:17.824
but I didn't dare question it.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.693
I just accepted terms
on a handshake.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.563
You shook on it?

14:23.596 --> 14:25.432
What?

14:25.465 --> 14:27.267
-Now what'd I do wrong?
-Nothing.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.002
Congratulations, sweetheart.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.170
I'm proud of you.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.771
Thank you, Pray.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.107
Now,

14:34.141 --> 14:36.309
where the hell are my boys?

14:40.447 --> 14:42.215
ANGEL:
Not worth it, Mother.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.888
-(door opens)
-RICKY: "Oh, my God!

14:48.922 --> 14:50.623
You guys are so cute!"

14:50.657 --> 14:52.792
-"Oh, my God.
Like, how do you move
-(laughing)

14:52.825 --> 14:55.929
your hands so fast?
You got to teach me."

14:55.963 --> 14:58.698
(laughing)

14:58.731 --> 15:01.734
How fucking dare y'all
not show up to Derek's funeral.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.141
Y'all are mad disrespectful.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.944
And where were y'all?!

15:10.978 --> 15:12.879
You know what, don't tell me,

15:12.912 --> 15:15.748
'cause I can smell the liquor
from your breaths over here.

15:15.782 --> 15:18.952
We were downtown socializing
like you wanted us to?

15:18.986 --> 15:20.887
So we can get discovered.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.056
Bullshit. Y'all just didn't want
to deal with the reality

15:23.090 --> 15:25.425
of seeing one of y'all peers
lying in a coffin.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.427
I mean, you told us to take
advantage of this moment,

15:27.460 --> 15:28.962
and that's what we did.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.964
Yeah, we went down
to the Palladium for Sunday tea.

15:30.998 --> 15:33.800
And, like usual,
nobody paid us any mind.

15:33.833 --> 15:36.303
But then I started Voguing.

15:36.336 --> 15:39.139
You know, nothing special.
Just how I do at any ball.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.974
RICKY:
And then, like,
this crowd formed around us.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.810
And the rest of us joined in,
improvising. And, suddenly,

15:43.843 --> 15:46.113
it was like we were celebrities
or something.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.315
The whole club went nuts.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.816
CUBBY:
Mother, you were right.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.484
Times are changing.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.653
LEMAR:
Miss Thing, those blanquitos

15:53.686 --> 15:54.821
were living.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.589
We drank for free all night.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.758
Yo, they recognized
what we were doing,

15:58.791 --> 16:01.094
and it was like they saw us
for the first time.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.296
-We ain't invisible
-(grunting)

16:03.330 --> 16:06.033
to white folks no more.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.135
-Uh!
-(laughing)

16:08.168 --> 16:12.205
Ballroom is about to be more
popular than Studio 54 ever was.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.806
Ballroom is not a trend,

16:13.840 --> 16:15.808
nor is it
about some flashy dance moves.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.877
Ballroom is about family,

16:17.910 --> 16:20.347
something y'all
didn't show up for today.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.715
You know what?

16:22.749 --> 16:25.652
I'm tired of looking
at y'all faces.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.220
Go to y'all room.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.189
And drink some water.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.224
(indistinct chatter)

16:36.029 --> 16:38.031
(sighs)

16:46.839 --> 16:49.642
-* Talk to me, baby *
-CANDY: You and Florida
can dance.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.645
Elektra and Aphrodite
serve realness.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.315
Veronica... Uh,

16:55.348 --> 16:57.350
Veronica...

16:57.384 --> 16:58.651
She's a seamstress, girl.

16:58.685 --> 16:59.652
That takes skills.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.221
You know what, you right.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.855
I can't be measuring
everybody's worth based

17:02.889 --> 17:04.824
off what they can do
under the ballroom spotlight.

17:04.857 --> 17:08.161
A behind-the-scenes bitch
is necessary to every house.

17:08.195 --> 17:11.864
And, um, what exactly
are your strengths?

17:11.898 --> 17:13.400
Fuck is that supposed to mean?

17:13.433 --> 17:14.901
* 'Cause you know you're... *

17:14.934 --> 17:17.170
Enough with all that stomping.

17:17.204 --> 17:21.241
I'm sure you girls
have worked up an appetite.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.610
-(music stops)
-What do we have here?

17:23.643 --> 17:26.045
This is a menu fit
for the runway.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.880
This absolutely will not do.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.450
There better be
some Chinese takeout on the way.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.119
We don't do MSG.
We're dieting.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.953
Then why is she serving
milkshakes?

17:33.986 --> 17:35.388
LULU:
It's SlimFast.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.889
You've seen the commercials.

17:36.923 --> 17:39.058
"Give us a week
and we'll take off the weight."

17:39.092 --> 17:40.427
CANDY:
Our house,

17:40.460 --> 17:42.895
our menu, our rules.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.534
It truly is a lovely house.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.569
Thank you, bitch.

17:49.602 --> 17:53.273
Our cuisine should be as equally
impressive, don't you think?

17:53.306 --> 17:55.875
The rent broke
my little piggy bank's back.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.711
I spent what was left
on some Orville Redenbacher,

17:58.745 --> 18:01.047
some SlimFast, and a manicure.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.550
My nails were ravaged
after all these errands.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.617
Any of you hos got
any complaints?

18:04.651 --> 18:06.286
They do look good, Mama.

18:06.319 --> 18:10.123
Look, it's not about what's
on the plate.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.559
Hmm? It's about communion,

18:12.592 --> 18:15.228
conversation,

18:15.262 --> 18:17.096
and the sisterhood.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.205
Here.

18:27.006 --> 18:28.475
It's good for your metabolism.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.510
(exhales)

18:31.678 --> 18:33.680
(clicks tongue)

18:34.847 --> 18:37.784
ELEKTRA:
Well, sisters,

18:37.817 --> 18:38.818
I must bring up the fact

18:38.851 --> 18:40.487
that I'm in need
of more closet space.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.821
That broom closet you gave me

18:41.854 --> 18:43.656
can only store
my hatboxes and gloves.

18:43.690 --> 18:47.093
Where am I supposed to put my
clothes, my coats, my jewelry?

18:47.126 --> 18:48.261
There's only one other closet.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.630
It's in my room,
and I share that with Lulu.

18:50.663 --> 18:53.633
You gonna share
your fine luxuries with us?

18:53.666 --> 18:56.336
Huh. Use the space
under your bed for storage.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.105
That is no way to store luxury.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.140
-Candy, wait, I think...
-Uh-uh. This is

19:01.174 --> 19:02.609
my house.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.777
It's my closet,
and it's allocated.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.480
You are a guest.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.316
You ain't talking to Blanca,
bitch.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.650
Remember that.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.285
You're right.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.487
This is your house.

19:14.521 --> 19:17.857
Glad you recognize that.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.726
You've made me realize
something.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.961
I've gone about this all wrong.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.531
I keep making space for you,
Candy,

19:24.564 --> 19:27.166
for Lulu, for Blanca.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.837
Something in me keeps bringing
me back to those girls I raised.

19:30.870 --> 19:31.904
But why?

19:31.938 --> 19:33.673
Why do I keep lowering myself
by associating

19:33.706 --> 19:35.842
with you tired,
old, raggedy reminders

19:35.875 --> 19:37.244
of my failure as a mother?!

19:37.277 --> 19:40.247
You ain't got no business
calling anybody old.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.249
You ain't nothing
but a over-the-hill,

19:42.282 --> 19:44.651
homeless sex change.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.886
-(gasping)
-ELEKTRA: That's it.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.721
That's where it all started.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.057
I got my operation

19:51.090 --> 19:53.560
and Mr. Ford left me
and I got soft.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.995
I became weak, insecure.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.664
But no more.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.899
What I now realize

19:59.932 --> 20:04.170
is I am the one and only

20:04.203 --> 20:07.073
Elektra.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.343
-(gasping)
-What the fuck?!

20:10.377 --> 20:11.778
Bitch, what is this?!

20:11.811 --> 20:12.779
("Bad Girls"
by Donna Summer playing)

20:12.812 --> 20:15.548
It's called
my new signature move.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.217
I'll send for my things.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.695
ELEKTRA:
Hello, my dear.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.730
Sorry. We're closed, hon.

20:30.763 --> 20:31.798
I'm starting a new house,

20:31.831 --> 20:33.700
and I need a girl like you.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.302
Ain't no white girls
in ballroom.

20:35.335 --> 20:38.204
Consider this
affirmative action.

20:38.237 --> 20:42.775
I am building the fiercest
house ballroom has ever seen.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.478
I dominate runway.

20:45.512 --> 20:48.748
But dance is the future.

20:48.781 --> 20:49.816
* Beep beep *

20:49.849 --> 20:51.618
And if I want
to snatch trophies,

20:51.651 --> 20:54.987
I need children
who will Vogue the house down.

20:55.021 --> 20:58.758
The legendary and iconic
Madonna has seen to that.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.561
Her song's number ten this week
with a bullet.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.896
You're better than this,
Jazmine.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.232
Only a fool would count out
a beauty,

21:06.265 --> 21:08.668
a talent like you.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.770
Stand by my side,
and I promise

21:10.803 --> 21:13.406
I will unleash
your fullest potential.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.476
-* If the price is right *
-* Beep beep. *

21:16.509 --> 21:18.978
-(cheering)
-It's story time, children.

21:19.011 --> 21:22.148
Mother Goose
is about to tuck...

21:22.181 --> 21:24.584
you... in

21:24.617 --> 21:27.153
-with fairy tales dripped
in romance
-(whooping)

21:27.186 --> 21:28.788
and drama.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.323
All right, up first,

21:30.357 --> 21:32.692
Evangelista.

21:32.725 --> 21:33.860
("Fly Robin Fly"
by Silver Convention playing)

21:33.893 --> 21:36.295
Romeo, Romeo,

21:36.329 --> 21:38.331
where art thou, Romeo?

21:39.566 --> 21:40.867
(whooping)

21:40.900 --> 21:42.134
My Juliet!

21:46.005 --> 21:47.206
-CANDY: Drink!
-(shouting)

21:47.239 --> 21:49.709
Drink! Drink!

21:49.742 --> 21:52.178
(exclaiming)

21:59.919 --> 22:03.322
* Fly, robin, fly *

22:03.356 --> 22:07.326
(high-pitched crying)

22:07.360 --> 22:08.628
Romeo!

22:08.661 --> 22:11.330
* Fly, robin, fly *

22:11.364 --> 22:13.299
(exaggerated crying)

22:13.332 --> 22:17.737
* Up, up to the sky *

22:17.770 --> 22:19.806
MAN:
You better die, bitch!

22:19.839 --> 22:21.508
(gasping)

22:21.541 --> 22:23.510
(exaggerated choking)

22:23.543 --> 22:26.178
(cheering and applause)

22:31.718 --> 22:33.820
All right.
Well, Lil Papi

22:33.853 --> 22:37.056
is certainly putting that GED
to good use, y'all.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.726
Y'all gonna learn
y'all Shakespeare on tonight!

22:39.759 --> 22:41.160
Give them a hand

22:41.193 --> 22:44.163
for that fabulous,
fabulous interpretation.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.331
Y'all take a bow!

22:45.364 --> 22:47.534
Now, what story
is Ferocity telling?

22:47.567 --> 22:49.669
-(cheering)
-Oh, I think I know

22:49.702 --> 22:52.505
what this one is...

22:52.539 --> 22:54.507
From rags to bitches, y'all.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.709
I think somebody wants
to go to the ball.

22:56.743 --> 22:59.145
(whooping)

23:02.381 --> 23:05.284
FLORIDA:
And who are you?

23:05.317 --> 23:07.954
It's me, your fairy godmother,

23:07.987 --> 23:10.790
here to get you ready
for the ball, Cinderella.

23:10.823 --> 23:13.125
(cheering)

23:13.159 --> 23:14.894
PRAY TELL:
Oh!

23:14.927 --> 23:19.398
Oh...!

23:19.432 --> 23:23.903
Who brought Shabbat shalom?!

23:23.936 --> 23:26.573
She's going to the goddamn ball!

23:26.606 --> 23:31.978
All right,
bibbidi-bibbidi-boo, bitch!

23:32.011 --> 23:33.412
Yes! Oh!

23:33.446 --> 23:36.916
House of Ferocity is not playing
with these Disney classics.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.284
-I s-- Oh!
-(gasping)

23:38.317 --> 23:40.487
-What on earth is going on?
-(indistinct chatter)

23:40.520 --> 23:44.023
Who did not pay the light bill?!

23:46.759 --> 23:49.161
(murmuring, whooping)

23:56.368 --> 23:59.238
Elektra, we're in the middle
of a category.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.973
We're not here to walk.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.742
(whooping)

24:02.775 --> 24:05.978
Then why are you pulling stunts,
bitch?

24:06.012 --> 24:07.413
-(gasping, murmuring)
-We're making an entrance.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.348
May we introduce ourselves?

24:09.381 --> 24:11.651
BLANCA:
Pray Tell, they can't be
storming balls like this,

24:11.684 --> 24:14.253
interrupting festivities,
just to make a statement.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.455
They not welcome
with Snow White in tow.

24:16.489 --> 24:18.124
-(gasping)
-Shush, mongrel.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.792
-(gasping)
-Enough of your lip, Elektra.

24:19.826 --> 24:21.293
(shouting)

24:21.327 --> 24:22.795
It's hammer time, bitch.

24:22.829 --> 24:26.265
(shrieking, shouting)

24:26.298 --> 24:28.801
You about to get
that fourth face-lift, bitch.

24:28.835 --> 24:32.138
I've come prepared to gut you
like the fish you'll never be!

24:32.171 --> 24:33.806
(gasping)

24:33.840 --> 24:35.441
Security, come out here
and break this shit up.

24:35.474 --> 24:36.943
-Break it up!
-(shouting)

24:36.976 --> 24:38.477
Break it up!

24:38.511 --> 24:42.148
This is a ball, not a brawl!

24:42.181 --> 24:44.316
All I wanted to do
was introduce my house.

24:44.350 --> 24:45.852
Aren't I worthy of that,

24:45.885 --> 24:48.721
considering all the glory
I brought to ballroom?

24:52.158 --> 24:54.460
The council has spoken.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.195
No, bitch.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.497
-(cheering)
-Bye, Elektra.

24:58.531 --> 25:01.968
Get your paws off me, beasts.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.603
(booing, hissing)

25:06.338 --> 25:09.008
We are the House of Wintour,

25:09.041 --> 25:12.244
named after the legendary
editor in chief

25:12.278 --> 25:14.814
of the sacred text
that is Vogue.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.248
(light cheering)

25:16.282 --> 25:18.651
Quake in fear, children.

25:18.685 --> 25:21.153
Wintour is coming.

25:21.187 --> 25:24.356
(whooping, gasping)

25:25.758 --> 25:27.059
-LEMAR: Mother.
-Mother?

25:27.093 --> 25:28.427
Mother.

25:29.461 --> 25:32.064
That house is banjee.

25:33.065 --> 25:35.467
-Take us back.
-BLANCA: What?

25:38.571 --> 25:40.372
(indistinct chatter)

25:40.406 --> 25:41.941
PRAY TELL:
Those two house-hopping bitches.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.743
This shit is above my pay grade.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.245
-I need a break.
-(microphone feedback)

25:46.278 --> 25:49.115
-* You better watch your man *
-* You better watch your man *

25:49.148 --> 25:51.183
* 'Cause, girl, he's doing *

25:51.217 --> 25:53.519
You look like you could use
a drink.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.454
No, I'm good.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.456
And I'm Chris.

25:57.489 --> 25:59.458
Have a drink with me.

25:59.491 --> 26:01.628
I'm looking for true love.

26:01.661 --> 26:02.962
(chuckles softly)
Sorry, I'm not available.

26:02.995 --> 26:04.897
Mm. They never are.

26:04.931 --> 26:07.099
(chuckles)
At the start.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.802
You're cuter than I imagined.

26:09.836 --> 26:12.204
Don't tell me--
you've seen me in your dreams.

26:12.238 --> 26:15.041
No. In photos.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.810
I was Ricky's bunkmate on tour.

26:19.846 --> 26:21.814
-Chris, you said?
-Mm.

26:21.848 --> 26:23.616
He never mentioned you.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.451
(chuckles) Course not.

26:25.484 --> 26:28.921
Can't be guilty of a crime
no one knows you committed.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.923
You know what? You're a liar.

26:30.957 --> 26:33.592
I trust Ricky.
I don't have no reason not to.

26:33.626 --> 26:36.095
I am your reason.

26:36.128 --> 26:38.898
I fucked your man,
and everybody knows it.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.466
You know what?
You got a lot to say,

26:40.499 --> 26:42.468
and you need to just squash it,
okay?

26:42.501 --> 26:44.804
-I don't really understand...
-She claims she didn't suspect,

26:44.837 --> 26:46.739
but, uh, that gut
tells a different story.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.975
-What?
-Is it true?
Did you sleep with him

26:49.008 --> 26:51.644
-while you were on tour?
-What? Babe, no.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.946
I... Sleep with Chris?
I would never do that to you.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.648
That's not what you were saying
all summer.

26:57.183 --> 26:59.318
-Will you back the fuck up?
-Oh!

26:59.351 --> 27:01.087
Don't be mad at me.
Don't be mad at me.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.488
You're the one in denial.

27:02.521 --> 27:04.323
What'd you think he was doing
every time you called

27:04.356 --> 27:05.825
and couldn't reach him? Hmm?

27:05.858 --> 27:07.126
Playing cards?

27:07.159 --> 27:08.527
Know what, can you shut
your fucking mouth?

27:08.560 --> 27:10.529
Why don't you drop ten pounds?
Hmm?

27:10.562 --> 27:12.198
Move out the fucking way.
Keep talking!

27:12.231 --> 27:13.666
(indistinct shouting)

27:16.736 --> 27:20.139
Is this really
fucking happening again?

27:20.172 --> 27:23.710
Another fight?
I'm shutting this ball down

27:23.743 --> 27:25.712
until you bitches learn
how to act.

27:25.745 --> 27:28.314
Get out of here
and get some common sense.

27:28.347 --> 27:31.483
Get out! Get out!

27:31.517 --> 27:33.185
We got other shit
to worry about right now.

27:33.219 --> 27:35.154
Y'all fighting each other.

27:35.187 --> 27:37.690
Fuck!

27:37.724 --> 27:40.326
BLANCA:
Y'all have been going
back and forth about this

27:40.359 --> 27:42.061
for hours.
Why don't y'all just go to bed

27:42.094 --> 27:43.529
-and talk about it tomorrow?
-No, we're not gonna do that!

27:43.562 --> 27:45.164
No, we're gonna talk
about it right now!

27:45.197 --> 27:47.333
Now swear to me.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.468
Swear it's a lie.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.871
Tell all the Evangelistas
that you're not a cheater.

27:51.904 --> 27:54.540
-Go ahead!
-It's not true.

27:54.573 --> 27:57.009
-I would never do that to you.
-Why wouldn't you tell me

27:57.043 --> 27:58.811
that there was another gay guy
dancing with you?

27:58.845 --> 28:00.813
I mean, it's a concert tour.
Aren't all the dancers gay?

28:00.847 --> 28:03.682
Can you please give them
some privacy?

28:03.716 --> 28:06.152
-Why you staying?
-So they don't murder
each other.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.553
And then to think you told me

28:07.586 --> 28:09.688
that all the guys you were
dancing with were straight!

28:10.890 --> 28:12.491
So you lied to me now?!

28:12.524 --> 28:14.526
I didn't tell you about Chris
because if I did,

28:14.560 --> 28:15.828
you would just jump
to conclusions.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.329
You always so jealous.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.931
Oh, so now I'm always jealous.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.366
-When have I ever been jealous?!
-RICKY: You right.

28:20.399 --> 28:21.500
DAMON:
What the fuck you laughing at?

28:21.533 --> 28:23.002
-Huh?!
-You right.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.103
You ain't never jealous.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.371
(chuckles): You don't ever jump
to conclusions.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.339
-I'm the crazy one.
-You know what?

28:27.373 --> 28:28.908
I don't even trust
your ass anymore.

28:28.941 --> 28:31.577
And to think I let you talk me
into not wearing a condom!

28:31.610 --> 28:33.079
-Again!
-Excuse me?

28:33.112 --> 28:34.413
I thought we had a conversation
about safety.

28:34.446 --> 28:36.648
No, well, I thought
we were being monogamous.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.418
(exhales)

28:42.789 --> 28:44.757
(door closes)

28:51.330 --> 28:52.731
(dog barks)

28:54.233 --> 28:56.202
ELIZABETH:
What are the dogs' names?

28:56.235 --> 28:57.904
This one is Cash,

28:57.937 --> 28:59.571
and the one on my left
is Credit.

28:59.605 --> 29:01.974
Make sure that makes it
in the story.

29:02.008 --> 29:03.209
I'll do my best.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.210
(growling)

29:04.243 --> 29:05.444
I told your editor

29:05.477 --> 29:06.913
the only way
I'm agreeing to this

29:06.946 --> 29:08.881
is if I have
some editorial control.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.249
I'm not letting you write

29:10.282 --> 29:12.484
-some torpedo piece.
-My angle

29:12.518 --> 29:14.887
was going to be that
powerful women can have it all

29:14.921 --> 29:18.157
-even after a tough divorce.
-Oh.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.159
-Well, I like that.
-(door opens, closes)

29:20.192 --> 29:21.828
Jonas, where have you been?

29:21.861 --> 29:23.762
And why can't you wear a suit?

29:23.796 --> 29:25.798
-You're an executive now.
-(barks)

29:25.832 --> 29:28.000
My portfolio is the largest

29:28.034 --> 29:30.636
of any female real estate owner
in the city,

29:30.669 --> 29:32.271
probably the world.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.974
But I like to keep
the organization streamlined.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.675
Efficiency.

29:36.708 --> 29:39.145
Jonas is
the executive vice president.

29:39.178 --> 29:42.514
-I was out making collections.
-(dog barks)

29:45.351 --> 29:48.654
He personally oversees
the collection of rents.

29:48.687 --> 29:51.858
It gives him a chance
to check in on every property.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.260
A personal touch
that can only happen

29:54.293 --> 29:56.795
in a family business.

29:56.829 --> 29:59.966
This is Umbro.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.468
It's more expensive
than a Ralph Lauren suit.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.836
(dogs growling)

30:03.870 --> 30:05.337
Let's take a break, Elizabeth.

30:05.371 --> 30:06.839
Would you excuse us a moment?

30:13.846 --> 30:17.149
Don't ever flash cash
in front of a reporter again.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.351
Do you want the IRS
on our asses?

30:19.385 --> 30:21.320
And stop using
the word "collections."

30:21.353 --> 30:23.322
You sound like a mafioso.

30:24.891 --> 30:28.527
You know that storefront
you rented out yesterday?

30:28.560 --> 30:30.329
I went to check
with the electrician,

30:30.362 --> 30:32.664
and I ran into the new tenant.

30:32.698 --> 30:34.666
You know it's a guy, right?

30:34.700 --> 30:35.968
The Dominican?

30:36.002 --> 30:37.569
(laughs):
You're out of your mind.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.738
You're too busy
being superior to people

30:39.771 --> 30:41.407
to actually look at them.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.975
I'm telling you,

30:43.009 --> 30:44.676
that's a man.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.678
(growls)

30:46.712 --> 30:49.048
If that's true, he has to go.

30:51.117 --> 30:52.584
JONAS:
Excuse me,
what's your name again?

30:52.618 --> 30:55.254
-Uh, Blanca.
-Blanca, yeah. How you doing?

30:55.287 --> 30:56.923
Listen, I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

30:56.956 --> 30:58.757
but this ain't gonna work out.
You got to go.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.592
-What are you talking about?
-This is your money.
Thank you very much,

31:00.626 --> 31:02.161
-but my mother
wants you out of here.
-Are you kidding me?

31:02.194 --> 31:03.595
-Your mother?
-I don't want to hear it.
You're out.

31:03.629 --> 31:04.763
You know, I'm gonna have...

31:04.796 --> 31:06.032
JONAS:
You have to the end of the day.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.766
End of the day.

31:07.799 --> 31:10.502
BLANCA:
Got a landlord
and her ogre spawn.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.338
He said he wasn't renting
to me no more.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.340
-I got clocked.
-That's a damn shame.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.608
You ain't even polished a
fingernail up in that dump yet.

31:16.642 --> 31:19.545
Girl, I'm sorry.
I'm just saying.

31:19.578 --> 31:20.947
I'm just saying

31:20.980 --> 31:23.249
they can't be evicting you
like that. It's illegal.

31:23.282 --> 31:26.452
Since when a poor, brown
transsexual got any rights?

31:26.485 --> 31:28.520
Plus, there ain't no paper trail
to even prove

31:28.554 --> 31:30.589
I was even there.
I paid her cash.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.191
She didn't make me sign nothing.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.560
-(sighs)
-How could I be so stupid?

31:34.593 --> 31:36.628
And you don't even want to know

31:36.662 --> 31:38.597
Damon's drama.
Not only is he accusing Ricky

31:38.630 --> 31:40.699
of sticking his penis
in anything that walks,

31:40.732 --> 31:43.302
but he just admitted to me
that they doing it raw.

31:43.335 --> 31:45.071
-Oh, girl.
-What the hell

31:45.104 --> 31:46.905
do I have to do
to get through to him?

31:46.939 --> 31:49.641
To make him see
that he is way too valuable

31:49.675 --> 31:51.643
-to be taking risks like that?
-You know,

31:51.677 --> 31:54.746
gay black boys
ain't never been trained

31:54.780 --> 31:57.950
to have a dollop of self-belief.
You know that.

31:57.984 --> 32:01.887
And even if he did value himself
enough to use protection,

32:01.920 --> 32:03.789
he ain't thinking about tomorrow

32:03.822 --> 32:05.992
when he's laid up there
with Ricky.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.760
-Well...
-You and I have both been
where they are.

32:09.795 --> 32:11.830
How you think we got here?

32:13.832 --> 32:15.601
Wait, that's it.

32:15.634 --> 32:16.902
They need to know that I've been

32:16.935 --> 32:18.904
where they are, that
I understand their struggle.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.772
Shit, if I would've known
my worth at their age,

32:20.806 --> 32:22.975
-maybe I would've made
some smarter choices.
-Yes.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.110
Listen.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.646
You are their mother.

32:27.679 --> 32:29.915
Set an example.

32:29.948 --> 32:33.652
They need to see you out there
righting them wrongs now, too.

32:33.685 --> 32:35.954
If you're not willing

32:35.988 --> 32:38.624
to go defend yourself
against that landlady,

32:38.657 --> 32:42.528
how do you expect your children
to ever fight for themselves?

32:57.976 --> 33:00.179
BLANCA (whispers):
Oh, God.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.815
You are trespassing.

33:03.849 --> 33:05.551
I paid you first and last.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.219
This is my place
for at least two months.

33:07.253 --> 33:08.620
You deceived me.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.222
I can work with thieves
and murderers,

33:10.256 --> 33:12.158
but I cannot do business with...

33:13.159 --> 33:14.226
...a liar.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.827
Norman Properties

33:15.861 --> 33:17.563
reserves the right
to evict tenants

33:17.596 --> 33:19.331
-at any time.
-Wait, I'm sorry.

33:19.365 --> 33:20.999
Was that written
in my rental contract?

33:21.033 --> 33:22.968
The one you told me
we didn't need?

33:23.001 --> 33:25.003
You know,
I talked to those nice people

33:25.037 --> 33:27.506
at New York City Commission
of Human Rights.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.141
They're in charge of making sure
people like you

33:29.175 --> 33:30.976
don't discriminate
against people of color

33:31.009 --> 33:32.678
when renting to us,
and they set me up

33:32.711 --> 33:35.181
with a nice lawyer pro bono.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.815
And she said without a contract,

33:36.848 --> 33:39.351
I've got squatter's rights,
and I should stay put

33:39.385 --> 33:41.320
-until I have my day in court.
-Sweetheart,

33:41.353 --> 33:43.655
I've got an entire law firm
on retainer.

33:43.689 --> 33:46.158
I've got the best Jews
from Harvard and Yale

33:46.192 --> 33:47.993
-ready to squash you like a bug.
-You know,

33:48.026 --> 33:49.328
for the first time in my life,

33:49.361 --> 33:50.696
I'm fighting back
to the bitter end.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.232
I'm not here
to gentrify neighborhoods

33:53.265 --> 33:55.000
so white ladies like you
can feel comfortable

33:55.033 --> 33:56.768
walking down the street.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.338
I'm here for me.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.740
It's not just Jews I have
in my Rolodex.

34:01.773 --> 34:04.376
I've got Italians, Russians.

34:04.410 --> 34:07.346
Ones that can be
very persuasive.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.948
-Are you threatening me?
-Only your kneecaps.

34:09.981 --> 34:12.118
You think I'm scared
of a beating?

34:12.151 --> 34:14.620
I've had more beatings
than you've had breakfast.

34:14.653 --> 34:15.954
Now shoo.

34:15.987 --> 34:19.258
I have a grand opening
in two days.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.059
-You'll hear from my lawyers.
-(gasps)

34:21.093 --> 34:23.662
Good. It's on.

34:26.332 --> 34:28.467
DAMON:
It feels so good

34:28.500 --> 34:30.035
to have Cubby and Lemar

34:30.068 --> 34:31.237
and Elektra out of this house.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.738
It was getting too crowded
in here.

34:32.771 --> 34:33.905
You're not gonna be saying that

34:33.939 --> 34:35.307
when they dancing
for another house

34:35.341 --> 34:37.976
at the next ball
and we on the bottom again.

34:38.009 --> 34:40.979
I've seen plenty of bottoms flip
and become tops.

34:41.012 --> 34:43.149
-It's not that hard,
so work it out.
-(all laugh)

34:43.182 --> 34:44.416
All right, all right,
enough playing.

34:44.450 --> 34:46.418
Enough playing around.

34:46.452 --> 34:48.287
I got to talk to y'all
about something serious.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.289
Ricky, Damon,

34:50.322 --> 34:53.058
I was stunned to hear
that y'all two are still having

34:53.091 --> 34:54.826
unprotected sex.
I thought all those funerals

34:54.860 --> 34:57.929
we've been going to would scare
you into being responsible,

34:57.963 --> 35:01.333
but apparently...

35:01.367 --> 35:05.003
I need to take
some more direct action, so...

35:05.036 --> 35:06.938
-This is not happening
right now.
-Uh-uh. No.

35:06.972 --> 35:09.107
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-A cucumber?

35:09.141 --> 35:10.742
-No. No.
-We are going to take

35:10.776 --> 35:13.111
-some proper condom
application, so...
-That's so embarrassing.

35:13.145 --> 35:15.647
-All right.
-Now, I recommend pre-lube

35:15.681 --> 35:17.283
when putting it on
so it doesn't break

35:17.316 --> 35:18.650
and during penetration.

35:18.684 --> 35:20.319
During penetration.

35:20.352 --> 35:21.520
LIL PAPI:
Hey, remind me to skip the salad

35:21.553 --> 35:23.522
for dinner tomorrow,
you know what I'm saying?

35:23.555 --> 35:25.524
-(hits table)
-Shut your mouths!

35:26.658 --> 35:27.959
You think you're so special,

35:27.993 --> 35:29.628
this thing is just gonna
skip on over you,

35:29.661 --> 35:30.862
but you're not.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.169
Tell them.

35:39.205 --> 35:42.040
All right,
I'm-a tell y'all the hard truth.

35:44.843 --> 35:49.281
You boys are young, black,
gay, and poor.

35:49.315 --> 35:50.982
This world despises you.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.985
You get this disease, you die,
they feel relieved

35:54.019 --> 35:55.621
that you're getting
what you deserve.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.022
And living in a world like that

35:57.055 --> 35:59.291
can make you feel desperate
for love.

35:59.325 --> 36:02.027
Now, if you want to be healthy
and do it the healthy way,

36:02.060 --> 36:04.162
you can do it like
how our community does

36:04.196 --> 36:05.631
by forming houses.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.466
But it is much faster

36:07.499 --> 36:09.968
if you do it
in an unhealthy way.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.638
And that's what I did back then
when I started in this world

36:12.671 --> 36:15.841
in '83 or so, when none of us
understood this plague.

36:15.874 --> 36:17.676
(sighs)

36:19.378 --> 36:23.048
I thought the only way
to find love was with my body.

36:23.081 --> 36:27.085
So I would go out to a club,
get a little drunk,

36:27.118 --> 36:30.822
find me a man
that would love me for a while.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.891
And even in those moments

36:32.924 --> 36:34.860
when his arms were around me,
I believed he loved me.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.862
We didn't know

36:36.895 --> 36:38.230
each other's names.

36:38.264 --> 36:40.332
I just would convince myself

36:40.366 --> 36:42.368
that it would feel like that
forever.

36:45.203 --> 36:48.039
But it didn't.

36:48.073 --> 36:52.210
So I would find another
and then another.

36:52.244 --> 36:54.145
None of them ever even gave me
their name.

36:55.146 --> 36:56.682
I would completely debase
myself

36:56.715 --> 36:58.116
for these men.

36:58.149 --> 36:59.918
I just wanted love.
I just wanted

36:59.951 --> 37:01.420
to be somebody's precious thing.

37:01.453 --> 37:02.921
What girl doesn't want that?

37:02.954 --> 37:04.189
You know? Anyways,

37:04.222 --> 37:05.557
that happened
a couple of years back,

37:05.591 --> 37:08.026
and I stopped drinking
and doing that,

37:08.059 --> 37:09.861
but by then it was too late.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.197
I had let those guys
inside of me.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.733
Inside my heart, inside my body.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.368
I wanted to please them.

37:16.402 --> 37:18.737
I wanted
to make them feel so good,

37:18.770 --> 37:21.440
so I didn't use any condoms.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.976
And now...

37:29.147 --> 37:31.650
And now I got AIDS.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.289
(exhales)

37:37.323 --> 37:40.125
Listen, I'm sorry.

37:40.158 --> 37:41.960
I-I didn't mean
to hide it from y'all.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.562
I just wanted to protect y'all,

37:43.595 --> 37:47.132
and me telling the truth
is the only way I could do that.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.808
Look at me. I am fine.

37:56.842 --> 37:59.478
Y'all hear me?

38:06.952 --> 38:09.988
You are one brave woman,
you know that?

38:11.490 --> 38:13.859
You looked after me

38:13.892 --> 38:16.294
when no one else would,

38:16.328 --> 38:20.366
and I promise
I'm gonna look after you.

38:20.399 --> 38:21.967
All of us.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.635
Hmm?

38:23.669 --> 38:26.805
We're not gonna let a single
bad thing happen to you.

38:26.838 --> 38:29.541
(crying):
You get one little sniffle,

38:29.575 --> 38:31.843
and you come straight to me.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.480
I'll do whatever it takes

38:34.513 --> 38:37.148
to keep you healthy, huh?

38:37.182 --> 38:40.151
-I'll steal cold medicine
for you.
-(chuckles)

38:40.185 --> 38:41.553
I love you, Ma.

38:41.587 --> 38:43.689
BLANCA:
I love you, too. Listen,

38:43.722 --> 38:46.324
I don't want none of y'all
to not love y'all selves.

38:46.358 --> 38:47.893
That was my problem,

38:47.926 --> 38:49.327
my mistake,

38:49.361 --> 38:50.829
and sometimes it still is.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.498
But no more.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.500
No more. Which is why

38:54.533 --> 38:56.835
I'm-a fight this disease,

38:56.868 --> 38:59.705
and in doing so,
I'm-a fight Frederica Norman

38:59.738 --> 39:01.373
and get my salon back.

39:01.407 --> 39:03.341
(Blanca and Lil Papi chuckle)

39:08.514 --> 39:11.817
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

39:11.850 --> 39:13.852
Number 27.

39:30.301 --> 39:32.804
-(singsongy): Negative.
-Number 29?

39:35.907 --> 39:37.709
I thought you'd be happy.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.713
(sighs):
Ricky...

39:43.482 --> 39:45.383
Ricky, I love you.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.886
And maybe that's the reason
why I'm willing to turn

39:47.919 --> 39:50.589
or look the other way,
but I-I just need honesty.

39:50.622 --> 39:53.425
I told you,
nothing happened with Chris.

39:53.459 --> 39:56.628
Wait, where is this coming from?

39:57.663 --> 39:59.397
You know, you...

39:59.431 --> 40:02.367
just, you-you're touring
the world, you're in videos,

40:02.400 --> 40:04.970
you got all this attention--
what am I doing?

40:05.003 --> 40:07.806
School. The balls.

40:07.839 --> 40:10.208
That's something.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.578
All right?

40:12.611 --> 40:14.546
I'm lost. I...

40:14.580 --> 40:16.582
(sighs)

40:16.615 --> 40:20.519
I just really don't have a good
feeling about myself right now.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.692
You're my good feeling.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.795
I, uh...

40:29.828 --> 40:31.597
I... I have to go.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.064
I'm sorry.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.266
Um, I'm gonna be late
for a rehearsal.

40:35.300 --> 40:36.768
But I promise

40:36.802 --> 40:40.005
we're gonna finish this
later, okay?

40:41.607 --> 40:43.274
Hey.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.878
(chuckles)

40:47.946 --> 40:50.015
Go to rehearsal.

41:12.704 --> 41:15.106
All right, all right, y'all,
welcome to the Eros Ball.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.342
Welcome to the Eros Ball.

41:17.375 --> 41:19.611
-(cheering)
-Yes! Yes!

41:19.645 --> 41:21.312
Tonight we're
celebrating passion...

41:21.346 --> 41:24.683
and reveling in love...

41:24.716 --> 41:25.984
and sex.

41:26.017 --> 41:28.119
And I'm talking about lust.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.188
You know, that sweet smell

41:30.221 --> 41:31.823
of new passion.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.491
And I'm talking about...

41:33.525 --> 41:35.460
desire.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.363
-(cheering, whistling)
-And however that comes to you,

41:38.396 --> 41:41.332
I need you all to understand
that you must treat yourselves

41:41.366 --> 41:43.569
with dignity,
because everyone in this room

41:43.602 --> 41:45.170
is deserving of love.

41:45.203 --> 41:46.638
Y'all understand me?

41:46.672 --> 41:48.640
-(cheering)
-Everyone in this room

41:48.674 --> 41:50.842
is deserving of love.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.745
All right?

41:53.779 --> 41:56.314
And love should
feel good. Right?

41:56.347 --> 41:58.083
And love should also be safe.

41:58.116 --> 42:01.419
Y'all see what
I'm passing out here tonight?

42:01.452 --> 42:02.988
Take a few of 'em with you.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.090
With y'all bein' nasty.

42:05.123 --> 42:07.025
(Pray Tell chuckles)

42:07.058 --> 42:08.426
Now...

42:08.459 --> 42:10.996
let's get this ball started.

42:11.029 --> 42:14.833
-(cheering)
-The category is...

42:14.866 --> 42:16.835
High Fashion...

42:16.868 --> 42:18.704
in Feathers.

42:18.737 --> 42:21.172
And I want to see

42:21.206 --> 42:25.376
all my ladies stomp this bitch
to the ground.

42:25.410 --> 42:26.377
First up,

42:26.411 --> 42:28.680
House of Evangelista.

42:28.714 --> 42:30.448
-Come on up!
-(cheering)

42:30.481 --> 42:32.183
Oh! All right!

42:32.217 --> 42:35.286
Carrying the Mother
of the Year, darlings.

42:35.320 --> 42:37.388
All right, that chair's
a bit precarious.

42:37.422 --> 42:38.924
Please don't drop her.

42:38.957 --> 42:41.727
That would be
a devastating fall from grace.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.729
Come on, come on,
come on with it.

42:43.762 --> 42:45.563
I ain't mad at you.

42:45.597 --> 42:47.032
I ain't mad at you.
Are you hot?

42:47.065 --> 42:49.267
Do you need to be fanned, baby?

42:49.300 --> 42:50.636
Chocolate-y smooth!

42:50.669 --> 42:52.638
Give me your fuckin' wings!

42:52.671 --> 42:56.574
Come on, give Miss Blanca
Evangelista her scores.

42:56.608 --> 42:59.044
Eight, eight, seven,

42:59.077 --> 43:01.546
-eight, eight.
-(crowd groans)

43:01.579 --> 43:03.114
All right.
You're gonna have to do

43:03.148 --> 43:04.950
a little better than that,
I think.

43:04.983 --> 43:06.417
-But you look good today, girl.
-CANDY: Excuse me.

43:06.451 --> 43:09.254
-PRAY TELL: Huh?
-You got your scores. Move.

43:09.287 --> 43:12.457
Really, Miss Candy?
Did I not... just say

43:12.490 --> 43:15.593
the category is High Fashion

43:15.627 --> 43:16.962
in Feathers?

43:16.995 --> 43:18.630
Are you blind?
These are fucking feathers.

43:18.664 --> 43:20.732
Honey.
Could somebody please

43:20.766 --> 43:24.069
take this bitch back to
kindergarten, so she can learn

43:24.102 --> 43:27.973
the difference
between feathers and foam?

43:28.006 --> 43:30.575
Talking big talk now 'cause
I ain't got my other purse.

43:30.608 --> 43:31.977
(groans)

43:32.010 --> 43:34.312
Ferocity is chopped!

43:34.345 --> 43:35.947
(jeering, shouting)

43:38.616 --> 43:40.485
Girl, bye.
Thank you very much.

43:40.518 --> 43:41.586
Who's next?

43:41.619 --> 43:45.791
All right, House of Wintour
has entered the floor.

43:45.824 --> 43:48.459
(Pray Tell vocalizing)

43:51.897 --> 43:53.131
Oh, I'm living!

43:53.164 --> 43:54.766
All right, y'all bring it in.

43:54.800 --> 43:55.967
Y'all bring it in.

43:56.001 --> 43:56.968
Ah, ah,

43:57.002 --> 43:57.969
y'all bring it in.

43:58.003 --> 44:00.105
To the floor, to the floor.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.140
Y'all bring it in to the floor.

44:02.173 --> 44:03.875
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

44:03.909 --> 44:05.476
Love you.

44:05.510 --> 44:09.447
Oh...

44:09.480 --> 44:11.216
The House of Wintour

44:11.249 --> 44:14.986
is serving us down boots,
babies.

44:15.020 --> 44:18.356
I live... I live
for the production values.

44:18.389 --> 44:22.160
We got clams on a half shell
up in this bitch tonight.

44:22.193 --> 44:23.995
Well, actually,
it looks like a full shell!

44:24.029 --> 44:25.697
Crack that bitch open.

44:25.731 --> 44:27.165
Release the kraken!

44:27.198 --> 44:28.566
The Wintours are out for blood.

44:28.599 --> 44:32.503
-(cheering)
-Oh, sookie-sookie now!

44:32.537 --> 44:35.807
Deep out of the sea...

44:35.841 --> 44:38.977
it's black Aphrodite.

44:39.010 --> 44:41.146
The icon Elektra...

44:41.179 --> 44:44.215
dropped from the heavens, honey.

44:44.249 --> 44:46.051
Sometimes she's a mother,

44:46.084 --> 44:48.854
and other times
she's just a mother...

44:48.887 --> 44:50.188
-(cheering)
-Shut yo' mouth!

44:50.221 --> 44:52.057
The House of Wintour

44:52.090 --> 44:54.325
didn't come to play
with you hos tonight.

44:54.359 --> 44:56.661
They came to slay
you hos tonight.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.064
Good work. Your scores.

44:59.097 --> 45:00.498
Ten, ten,

45:00.531 --> 45:02.667
ten, ten, ten.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.702
Across the board!

45:04.736 --> 45:07.739
-*
-(cheering)

45:07.773 --> 45:09.207
Those aren't fuckin' feathers.

45:09.240 --> 45:12.277
I know, baby, but they better
than yours would ever be.

45:12.310 --> 45:13.879
I know that's hard to take.

45:13.912 --> 45:15.213
(cheering, whistling)

45:15.246 --> 45:18.083
And Miss Elektra takes
another trophy.

45:18.116 --> 45:21.052
I don't know
where you put 'em all.

45:21.086 --> 45:23.021
All right, all right!

45:23.054 --> 45:26.257
Yes, yes, yes, Mother Blanca,
listen here, listen here.

45:26.291 --> 45:30.428
Looks like Mother of the Year
is gonna be a bit more elusive

45:30.461 --> 45:33.765
this evening, but I want
to let y'all know something.

45:33.799 --> 45:38.136
There is an award that I know
that you can snatch with ease...

45:38.169 --> 45:41.773
and that's
Businesswoman of the Year!

45:41.807 --> 45:43.775
See, you bitches
don't know nothin' about that!

45:43.809 --> 45:45.643
Our Mother Blanca

45:45.676 --> 45:47.412
is an entrepreneur.

45:47.445 --> 45:48.947
Okay?

45:48.980 --> 45:51.883
You see, and she's
been discriminated against.

45:51.917 --> 45:53.919
But she's been standing up

45:53.952 --> 45:55.453
for her rights.

45:55.486 --> 45:57.622
And not just for herself

45:57.655 --> 46:00.491
but for everybody in this room!

46:00.525 --> 46:01.993
We got to fight for our rights.

46:02.027 --> 46:04.329
We got to fight for each other.

46:06.331 --> 46:09.000
So you may not have taken
the trophy home this evening,

46:09.034 --> 46:12.838
but, Mother Blanca, you are
a shining example of excellence,

46:12.871 --> 46:15.573
and you are always a champion...

46:15.606 --> 46:17.242
to me.

46:17.275 --> 46:18.776
Stand tall, stand proud.

46:18.810 --> 46:21.346
Ah, cha-kah-kah-kah.

46:22.547 --> 46:24.682
Hey, can I talk to you?

46:26.351 --> 46:29.821
* Baby love. *

46:29.855 --> 46:31.990
What's going on?

46:32.023 --> 46:34.125
You okay?

46:34.159 --> 46:36.995
Yeah. I've, um, been doing

46:37.028 --> 46:39.597
-some thinking about us and...
-Mm-hmm.

46:39.630 --> 46:41.466
what I said to you
when we got tested.

46:41.499 --> 46:43.768
Mm-hmm?

46:43.801 --> 46:45.636
I love you, Ricky.

46:45.670 --> 46:46.972
I do.

46:47.005 --> 46:48.606
Um, but...

46:48.639 --> 46:52.010
somewhere along the way
I've stopped loving myself,

46:52.043 --> 46:56.314
and I need to... try to figure
out how to love him again.

46:56.347 --> 46:58.349
What are you saying?

46:59.350 --> 47:01.319
We need to take a break.

47:01.352 --> 47:02.820
A break?

47:02.854 --> 47:04.990
Nah.

47:05.023 --> 47:06.624
I'm way too young to...

47:06.657 --> 47:08.659
have somebody
already be my everything.

47:08.693 --> 47:10.328
I...

47:12.730 --> 47:16.134
So... you're
breaking up with me?

47:16.167 --> 47:18.469
(chuckles)

47:18.503 --> 47:20.371
You can't be surprised.

47:22.173 --> 47:25.810
I mean, you can deny it, but I
know that you slept with Chris.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.979
-(exhales)
-And-and-and that is okay.

47:28.013 --> 47:30.015
I want you to be able
to pursue that.

47:30.048 --> 47:31.716
Don't-don't do this.

47:31.749 --> 47:32.951
Babe.

47:34.285 --> 47:36.521
Fight for us!

47:38.056 --> 47:39.590
Damon.

47:41.759 --> 47:43.929
Please.

47:45.630 --> 47:47.298
Please.

47:50.568 --> 47:54.205
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you.

47:56.908 --> 47:59.911
-I-If you...
-Oh, wow.

47:59.945 --> 48:02.713
want advice,
than you can go to Blanca.

48:04.715 --> 48:06.584
(sighs):
I...

48:06.617 --> 48:08.819
I-I can't help you.

48:12.057 --> 48:13.891
I'm sorry.

48:24.769 --> 48:27.005
(sniffles)

48:28.606 --> 48:30.475
I'm so happy you came to see me.

48:30.508 --> 48:32.577
Ha. For free booze?

48:32.610 --> 48:34.812
-Anytime, honey.
-Mm-hmm.

48:34.845 --> 48:37.448
I know why you invited me here.

48:37.482 --> 48:39.417
And why is that?

48:39.450 --> 48:43.621
For you to tell me to stop
pushing my medicinal agenda.

48:43.654 --> 48:46.057
You don't want Western medicine.

48:46.091 --> 48:47.892
You want to fight it your way.

48:47.925 --> 48:49.394
I get it.

48:49.427 --> 48:50.595
I'm not a pusher.

48:50.628 --> 48:51.929
I'm just an advocate.

48:52.998 --> 48:54.765
But we can still be friends.

48:54.799 --> 48:57.135
-(laughs)
-Can we? You want some wine?

48:57.168 --> 48:58.903
No, I'm good.
I'm just gonna have some water.

48:58.936 --> 48:59.904
Oh.

48:59.937 --> 49:02.240
We're on a health kick now?

49:02.273 --> 49:03.808
Yes.

49:06.611 --> 49:08.579
Hmm.

49:08.613 --> 49:10.648
I think I'm gonna start
taking them.

49:11.682 --> 49:14.252
It's about time, Blanca.

49:14.285 --> 49:16.354
They're gonna save your life.

49:21.692 --> 49:23.694
I'm scared.

49:24.996 --> 49:26.364
To die?

49:26.397 --> 49:28.366
Or to live?

49:41.046 --> 49:44.482
* Ooh, ah, ooh *

49:44.515 --> 49:46.517
-* Ooh *
-(Blanca sighs)

49:48.353 --> 49:51.022
* Ah, ah, ah, ooh *

49:55.726 --> 49:58.329
* Ain't there something
I can give? *

49:58.363 --> 49:59.830
Oh, my God,
you're my first customer.

49:59.864 --> 50:01.332
Welcome to Vogue Nails.

50:01.366 --> 50:02.733
Y'all got acrylics?

50:02.767 --> 50:04.469
Uh, yeah. How long you want 'em?

50:04.502 --> 50:06.537
-Long.
-Oh. Okay, well, come on.

50:06.571 --> 50:08.339
I'm gonna take good care of you.

50:09.374 --> 50:11.476
She said, "Long."

50:11.509 --> 50:14.145
What kind of nails do you want?
You want 'em like mine?

50:14.179 --> 50:17.382
* The scales are
sometimes unbalanced *

50:17.415 --> 50:18.849
This...

50:18.883 --> 50:22.220
-is called the Naomi.
-Oh!

50:22.253 --> 50:24.989
-It's all about the bawdy.
-(laughs)

50:25.022 --> 50:26.724
You gotta...

50:26.757 --> 50:28.726
Them legs
gon' get you far, girl.

50:28.759 --> 50:30.661
...hit, strike and work.

50:30.695 --> 50:32.063
Ooh.

50:32.097 --> 50:34.365
Oh! Hold on now.
You hittin' me with the hips?

50:34.399 --> 50:36.334
Gotta hit you with a pose.

50:36.367 --> 50:37.502
(laughs)

50:37.535 --> 50:40.037
* And so unselfishly *

50:41.606 --> 50:43.541
* And I tell you now *

50:43.574 --> 50:45.210
* That I made a vow *

50:45.243 --> 50:48.446
* I'm giving you
the best that I got *

50:48.479 --> 50:50.715
* Baby *

50:50.748 --> 50:52.783
* Yes, I tell you now *

50:52.817 --> 50:54.385
* That I made a vow *

50:54.419 --> 50:57.688
* I'm giving you
the best that I got *

50:57.722 --> 51:00.125
* Honey *

51:00.158 --> 51:03.461
* Everybody's got opinions *

51:03.494 --> 51:06.997
* About the way they think
our story's gonna end *

51:08.566 --> 51:10.968
I'm Damon Evangelista...

51:11.001 --> 51:12.970
and this is Vogue...

51:13.003 --> 51:14.572
one...

51:14.605 --> 51:15.973
oh...

51:16.006 --> 51:17.175
one.

51:18.576 --> 51:21.979
* We love so strong *

51:22.012 --> 51:26.083
* And so unselfishly *

51:27.985 --> 51:30.988
I said, in alphabetical order.

51:31.021 --> 51:32.890
Chanel, Dior, Fendi.

51:32.923 --> 51:34.225
Get it right.

51:34.259 --> 51:35.460
* Baby *

51:35.493 --> 51:37.395
-Oh, no, thanks. I'm not hungry.
-Mm!

51:37.428 --> 51:39.297
And I need to be
in fighting shape, anyway.

51:39.330 --> 51:41.932
Every day they have more
and more auditions for Voguers.

51:41.966 --> 51:43.568
You're focused.
I like that.

51:43.601 --> 51:45.102
* Listen, baby *

51:45.136 --> 51:46.671
I'm-a just say it.

51:46.704 --> 51:48.673
It don't feel right
that Ricky's not here.

51:48.706 --> 51:50.275
I respect that
you chose yourself,

51:50.308 --> 51:51.676
but we loved him, too.

51:51.709 --> 51:53.411
Let's see how much
y'all love him

51:53.444 --> 51:55.180
when y'all hear
he a Wintour now.

51:55.213 --> 51:57.014
What? Who told you that?

51:57.047 --> 51:59.350
You know what?
I'm not even worried.

51:59.384 --> 52:00.651
You should be.

52:00.685 --> 52:02.453
Elektra don't play fair.

52:02.487 --> 52:04.422
Well, guess what,
life ain't fair.

52:04.455 --> 52:06.123
Evangelistas have been
the underdogs before,

52:06.157 --> 52:08.593
and that ain't stopped us
from getting what's ours.

52:08.626 --> 52:09.860
We won against Elektra.

52:09.894 --> 52:11.529
I went toe-to-toe with Frederica

52:11.562 --> 52:13.130
and got my own salon open.

52:13.164 --> 52:15.032
And, shit,
I'm fighting against AIDS.

52:15.065 --> 52:17.034
-Yas, Motha.
-Thank you.

52:17.067 --> 52:20.805
So we can do anything
as long as we got each other.

52:20.838 --> 52:24.175
Well, that deserves
a goddamn toast.

52:24.209 --> 52:25.610
-Yeah!
-To family!

52:25.643 --> 52:27.111
-To family!
-To family!

WOMAN: A couple of months ago,

54:45.316 --> 54:48.319
you and your friends used a car
and a butcher's knife

54:48.353 --> 54:51.055
to kill four people
who had come here as tourists.

54:51.155 --> 54:53.491
Two of those people
were American citizens.

54:53.524 --> 54:55.960
Can you explain to me
why you killed them?

54:58.496 --> 55:00.130
So, why do you think
nothing happened?

55:00.164 --> 55:02.567
Is it hard to talk about
or think about?

55:03.834 --> 55:06.303
Did that not raise
a red flag for you?

55:06.337 --> 55:08.973
Why didn't we,
the United States,
see this coming?

55:10.641 --> 55:13.110

their minds.

-Ticktock, little birdie.

55:25.723 --> 55:28.559
