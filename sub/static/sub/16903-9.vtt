00:06.037 --> 00:08.105
Hey, Jack.

00:08.173 --> 00:09.273
- Did you dye your hair?
- No.

00:09.340 --> 00:10.941
No.

00:11.008 --> 00:13.153
So how was your New Year's?

00:13.220 --> 00:15.113
Wonderful. My dear friend,

00:15.181 --> 00:16.885
the deep-sea explorer Bob Ballard,

00:16.953 --> 00:19.553
Brought over a 2,000-year-old
amphora of wine

00:19.621 --> 00:22.022
From a sunken Phoenician trading vessel.

00:24.664 --> 00:29.208
The wine turned out to be quite toxic.

00:32.246 --> 00:33.982
My guests and I spent the stroke of midnight

00:34.050 --> 00:37.320
in my garden... vomiting.

00:37.388 --> 00:39.321
- Oh, my god, sorry.
- Don't be.

00:39.389 --> 00:41.221
The whole night... the purging, the new year,

00:41.289 --> 00:42.923
The vivid hallucinations of Astarte...

00:42.990 --> 00:45.489
The Phoenician goddess of sex and war...

00:45.557 --> 00:47.360
It all wiped the slate clean.

00:47.427 --> 00:49.326
So... Nancy Donovan...

00:49.393 --> 00:51.030
What happened before
Christmas was a mistake.

00:51.098 --> 00:54.766
She hasn't contacted me since,
so clearly she agrees it's over.

00:54.834 --> 00:56.767
Well, that's healthy. A clean break.

00:56.835 --> 00:58.169
Exactly. A clean break.

00:58.237 --> 00:59.405
So what about you, Lemon?

00:59.472 --> 01:01.774
Is your 2010 off to a good start?

01:01.842 --> 01:03.642
Well, I spent New Year's eve with my family,

01:03.710 --> 01:05.376
Which was actually very special.

01:05.444 --> 01:06.577
My cousin Randy,

01:06.645 --> 01:08.845
This kid from this rural coal mining town,

01:08.913 --> 01:10.246
Came out to us.

01:10.314 --> 01:12.181
And I think old Liz Lemon
had a little something

01:12.249 --> 01:13.382
To do with that.

01:13.449 --> 01:17.520
Randy's gay, everybody! He's gay.

01:17.588 --> 01:19.789
I think everyone knew.

01:21.593 --> 01:22.727
Finally!

01:22.794 --> 01:24.295
Over the break, I forgot
what floor I worked on.

01:24.362 --> 01:25.562
Six, Tracy.

01:25.630 --> 01:27.998
Six! I knew it was a
character from Blossom,

01:28.066 --> 01:29.868
But I couldn't find the Joey Russo button.

01:29.936 --> 01:31.903
Hold the door!

01:31.971 --> 01:34.671
You guys, I had the most amazing New Year's.

01:34.739 --> 01:38.607
I met James Franco's manager.
It was like a fairy tale.

01:38.675 --> 01:41.242
My client, James Franco,
he's actively looking

01:41.310 --> 01:42.677
For a relationship with a human woman

01:42.745 --> 01:44.646
To dispel certain unsavory rumors.

01:44.714 --> 01:47.115
Are you available for a fake
romance with a movie star?

01:47.183 --> 01:49.417
Does chewing on a sponge trick
your brain's hunger center?

01:49.485 --> 01:52.820
Yes! Yes! A million times yes!

01:52.888 --> 01:55.923
So this is some arranged
Hollywood relationship?

01:55.991 --> 01:57.458
With James Franco.

01:57.525 --> 01:58.726
Can you believe they went to me

01:58.794 --> 02:00.995
Before Ayilla from The Real World:
Cancun?

02:01.062 --> 02:02.263
I think it's great.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.831
The exposure will do wonders
for you and TGS.

02:03.899 --> 02:05.833
Lemon, I want you and
Jenna to have a meeting

02:05.901 --> 02:08.134
With James Franco and make sure
his manager doesn't screw her.

02:08.203 --> 02:09.336
Too late!

02:09.404 --> 02:10.571
Wait, which way did you mean that?

02:10.639 --> 02:13.274
I had a pretty amazing New Year's too.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.109
My wife and I are trying for a daughter,

02:15.177 --> 02:18.145
And on New Year's eve I
think I got Angie pregnant.

02:18.213 --> 02:19.413
No, no, no, no.

02:19.481 --> 02:22.182
Okay, but I was gonna describe it real good.

How was your New Year's, sir?

02:46.936 --> 02:48.770
Perfect.

02:48.838 --> 02:51.105
Oh, my god!

02:51.173 --> 02:52.707
As you know, on New Year's,

02:52.775 --> 02:54.742
I finally met my birth parents.

02:54.809 --> 02:59.711
So... thank you for asking about that!

02:59.778 --> 03:01.679
- I called her, Lemon.
- What?

03:01.747 --> 03:04.982
I called Nancy on New
Year's eve at 3:42 a.m.

03:05.049 --> 03:06.650
Damn that Phoenician wine!

03:06.717 --> 03:08.218
And you don't remember doing it?

03:08.285 --> 03:09.852
The last thing I remember
is going into a closet

03:09.920 --> 03:11.987
And switching clothes with Bob Ballard.

03:12.055 --> 03:13.155
Look, I don't think you
actually spoke to her.

03:13.223 --> 03:14.590
You hit pound after the number.

03:14.657 --> 03:16.024
I think you left a message.

03:16.092 --> 03:17.025
Cerie, get on her YouFace page.

03:17.092 --> 03:18.893
- Lemon, do you mind?
- No.

03:18.961 --> 03:21.362
One second. Okay.

03:22.897 --> 03:25.699
Okay, her YouFace page
says they're on vacation.

03:25.766 --> 03:27.500
They're borrowing a
friend's condo in Florida.

03:27.568 --> 03:28.868
Oh, what have I done?

03:28.936 --> 03:31.571
The woman is on vacation
with her husband as we speak,

03:31.639 --> 03:33.906
Probably having beach sex,
which is the third best sex

03:33.974 --> 03:35.908
After elevator and White House.

03:35.975 --> 03:38.676
Is there any chance that
she hasn't heard it yet?

03:38.744 --> 03:40.745
As a frequent leaver of drunken messages,

03:40.812 --> 03:42.914
I can tell you no good can come of this.

03:42.981 --> 03:44.915
As a frequent receiver of drunk messages,

03:44.983 --> 03:47.151
They are not cute,
even when they're from Liz.

03:47.218 --> 03:48.151
Da da da...

03:48.219 --> 03:49.319
Good lord,

03:49.387 --> 03:50.887
I've Lemoned the situation with Nancy!

03:50.955 --> 03:52.556
I've got to erase that message.

03:52.623 --> 03:53.923
"Lemoned"? That's not a thing

03:53.991 --> 03:55.658
People are saying now, is it?

03:55.726 --> 03:57.260
Cerie?

03:57.328 --> 03:59.529
Lemoned.

03:59.597 --> 04:01.164
Doing it awesome.

04:01.232 --> 04:03.000
Here's the general idea, Jenna.

04:03.067 --> 04:06.203
You and I pretend that we
met while filming a movie

04:06.271 --> 04:07.804
Called Space Attack.

04:07.872 --> 04:08.906
My title.

04:08.973 --> 04:10.274
This movie will never be released

04:10.341 --> 04:12.442
Because my performance will be deemed

04:12.510 --> 04:14.943
"too provocative for America."

04:15.011 --> 04:16.677
Oh, I wish I lived in France.

04:16.745 --> 04:18.712
But out of this experience,

04:18.779 --> 04:22.012
We found each other, et cetera, et cetera.

04:22.081 --> 04:24.416
Five dates a week, one fight a month.

04:24.483 --> 04:26.851
And because of a product
placement deal with Jamba Juice,

04:26.919 --> 04:29.220
The fight will be in a Jamba Juice.

04:29.287 --> 04:30.621
I love Jamba Juice!

04:30.689 --> 04:33.357
And this is the non-disclosure agreement

04:33.425 --> 04:35.492
Regarding anything you two
may learn about each other

04:35.560 --> 04:37.461
During the course of the relationship.

04:37.529 --> 04:40.931
Yeah, what exactly is Mr.
Franco covering up here?

04:40.999 --> 04:44.868
i>- Liz, are you familiar with
Japanese moe relationships,

04:44.936 --> 04:47.939
Where socially dysfunctional men develop

04:48.007 --> 04:50.674
Deep emotional attachments to body pillows

04:50.742 --> 04:52.643
With women painted on them?

04:52.711 --> 04:54.211
I am not, James.

04:54.279 --> 04:55.679
Neither am I, Liz!

04:55.747 --> 04:57.814
Which is why it's so weird

04:57.882 --> 04:59.283
The tabloids are running all these stories

04:59.350 --> 05:02.218
Saying I'm in love with a body pillow.

05:02.286 --> 05:03.987
I mean, it's crazy!

05:06.858 --> 05:08.592
Then why is that here?

05:11.363 --> 05:13.030
Why?

05:13.098 --> 05:15.633
I mean, why is this table here?

05:15.700 --> 05:17.935
I mean, why is that lamp here?

05:18.002 --> 05:19.835
Kimiko is--

05:19.903 --> 05:22.804
It is here like any other object.

05:22.872 --> 05:26.908
Objects are made by men and
used for many purposes.

05:26.976 --> 05:30.645
But we never love objects.

05:30.712 --> 05:34.282
Where do I sign?

05:36.652 --> 05:37.952
Hello?

05:38.020 --> 05:40.289
Liz? It's Randy, Randy Lemon.

05:40.356 --> 05:42.591
Oh, hey, Randy. What's up?

05:42.658 --> 05:45.326
Well, my parents and I are
kind of fighting right now.

05:45.394 --> 05:47.785
Because you spilled
orange soda on the couch?

05:47.853 --> 05:49.820
No, because of the gay thing.

05:49.888 --> 05:53.418
- So now I'm here in New York.
- Wait, you're in New York?

05:53.486 --> 05:55.854
Yeah, I figured I'd come
stay with my cool cousin Liz.

05:55.862 --> 05:57.989
Besides, what better place for me to be

05:57.997 --> 05:58.991
Now that I'm a homo?

05:59.159 --> 06:00.786
Is that the one we call ourselves?

06:00.854 --> 06:02.821
Nope. Get a cab, okay? Go to my apartment.

06:02.889 --> 06:04.690
168 Riverside Drive.

06:04.758 --> 06:06.825
Okay. Uh, actually there's a guy here

06:06.893 --> 06:09.328
Who offered to drive me if
I helped him move a couch

06:09.396 --> 06:10.529
Into a van.

06:10.597 --> 06:11.830
Nope. That's a serial killer.

06:11.898 --> 06:13.465
Just get a cab. I'll pay for it.

06:13.533 --> 06:14.800
You have Amish here?

06:14.868 --> 06:16.835
Just get in the house, Randy.

06:16.903 --> 06:20.839
Kenneth, Jonathan,
I need one of you to help me

06:20.907 --> 06:22.408
With a very special assignment.

06:23.677 --> 06:25.477
I hope it's me.

06:25.545 --> 06:27.379
But I'm honored just to
be standing here with you.

06:27.447 --> 06:29.748
I'm going to drive up to Waltham,
Massachusetts,

06:29.816 --> 06:31.150
Break into a woman's home,

06:31.217 --> 06:33.318
And erase a potentially
embarrassing and destructive

06:33.386 --> 06:34.853
Answering machine message.

06:34.921 --> 06:37.556
The home in questions has a doggy door.

06:37.624 --> 06:39.992
That will be our way in...

06:40.060 --> 06:41.520
Using these hangers.

06:41.588 --> 06:44.990
Prove that you are lithe enough
to accompany me to Waltham.

06:54.534 --> 06:57.036
It's Kenneth!

06:59.773 --> 07:02.207
You sicken me.

07:14.165 --> 07:14.898
I did it!

07:14.916 --> 07:16.417
Angie just called. She's pregnant.

07:16.484 --> 07:17.785
- That's awesome.
- Congratulations.

07:17.852 --> 07:20.421
Yes. And it gets better.
I just had a burrito!

07:20.488 --> 07:22.990
Well, now you just have
to hope that it's a girl.

07:23.058 --> 07:24.692
I know it's a girl, Liz Lemon,

07:24.759 --> 07:26.360
Because I yelled "Susan B. Anthony"

07:26.428 --> 07:28.629
- At the moment of conception.
- Well, that'll do it.

07:28.697 --> 07:29.630
We're gonna name her after the place

07:29.698 --> 07:31.332
That she was conceived.

07:31.399 --> 07:32.499
It was a pretty wild night.

07:32.567 --> 07:35.235
So we gonna name her either Virginia,

07:35.303 --> 07:40.474
Netjet, or bathroom at Teterboro airport.

07:40.542 --> 07:44.545
Oh, Liz, I'm in love.

07:44.612 --> 07:46.313
You're really not.

07:46.381 --> 07:48.215
James and I just had
lunch at The Spotted Pig.

07:48.283 --> 07:50.317
The paparazzi were everywhere.

07:50.385 --> 07:52.886
The gossip blogs are calling us "James."

07:52.954 --> 07:54.888
It's a combination of Jenna and James.

07:54.956 --> 07:57.024
Jenna, look, I'm glad
that you're having fun,

07:57.092 --> 07:58.659
But is this really all that you want?

07:58.727 --> 08:01.862
I mean, you and I are
not getting any younger.

08:01.930 --> 08:03.797
You don't know that thing
I sleep in isn't working.

08:03.865 --> 08:05.966
Don't you want more than
some fake boyfriend?

08:06.034 --> 08:07.167
Don't you want to be happy?

08:07.235 --> 08:09.036
Liz, I am happy.

08:09.104 --> 08:11.305
All this attention,
getting my picture taken,

08:11.373 --> 08:14.074
Having ice-cold diarrhea from
drinking too much Jamba Juice...

08:14.142 --> 08:16.176
It's everything I ever wanted.

08:32.466 --> 08:33.698
Sorry, sir.

08:33.767 --> 08:36.235
That happens sometimes
when I unhinge my pelvis.

08:44.778 --> 08:46.746
Oh, I was afraid of this.

08:46.813 --> 08:48.915
It's not an answering machine,
it's a voice mail.

08:48.982 --> 08:50.883
Okay, well, we just need to look for clues

08:50.951 --> 08:52.084
To her password.

08:52.152 --> 08:53.920
It'll be like the Da Vinci Code.

08:53.987 --> 08:55.888
Ehh... albino monk!

08:55.956 --> 08:57.156
That's a mirror, Kenneth.

08:57.224 --> 08:59.225
She must have written it down somewhere.

08:59.293 --> 09:01.260
Try on the computer.

09:01.328 --> 09:03.462
Okay.

09:03.530 --> 09:04.931
Search...

09:04.998 --> 09:07.099
Oops!

09:07.167 --> 09:08.267
I just took my picture with
that little camera thing.

09:08.335 --> 09:09.802
- Kenneth!
- All right.

09:09.870 --> 09:13.506
I just need to erase that picture.

09:13.574 --> 09:15.741
Whoops, I just made it the desktop image.

09:15.809 --> 09:16.742
How did I do that?

09:16.810 --> 09:20.012
Wait a minute.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.682
Wait a minute!

09:22.749 --> 09:25.084
Ah!

09:25.152 --> 09:27.920
Nancy's husband has been
sleeping on the couch.

09:27.988 --> 09:29.655
"emailing image to address book"?

09:29.723 --> 09:32.825
What is wrong with me?

09:32.893 --> 09:35.695
- Hey, Liz.
- Oh, thank god.

09:35.762 --> 09:37.296
Randall Lemon, where were you?

09:37.364 --> 09:38.397
I'm sorry, I met these two guys

09:38.465 --> 09:39.599
And they just dropped me off.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.534
Well, I'm glad they brought you home, but...

09:41.602 --> 09:42.802
That's where I'm meeting them later...

09:42.869 --> 09:44.337
A bar called "Home Butt."
- No, you're not.

09:44.404 --> 09:46.128
You came to New York to
see your cool cousin,

09:46.196 --> 09:47.897
Not run around with strange gentlemen.

09:47.964 --> 09:49.865
You don't have to be so protective of me.

09:49.933 --> 09:51.901
This is New York City, Randy.

09:51.968 --> 09:53.302
Liz, you know how hard it was growing up gay

09:53.370 --> 09:55.037
In Methenburg, Pennsylvania?

09:55.105 --> 09:58.040
The local TV station edited
Will & Grace down so much

09:58.108 --> 09:59.675
that it was just called Karen.

09:59.743 --> 10:01.210
Being in New York, this is the first time

10:01.278 --> 10:02.678
I've ever felt like myself.

10:02.746 --> 10:06.182
And I want to go out and enjoy it, have fun.

10:06.249 --> 10:07.483
Oh, we're gonna have fun.

10:07.551 --> 10:09.919
We're gonna stay here and make nachos

10:09.986 --> 10:13.255
And see who can fall asleep the earliest.

10:13.323 --> 10:14.757
Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun!

10:14.824 --> 10:17.193
This is nice.

10:17.260 --> 10:20.729
Your hand feels like a pillow
that's been in the microwave.

10:20.797 --> 10:22.598
Thanks.

10:22.666 --> 10:27.269
Okay, well... I'll see you tomorrow.

10:27.337 --> 10:29.505
Wait.

10:35.312 --> 10:37.546
Oh, it's okay. You can stop.

10:37.614 --> 10:38.747
- I was wrong.
- What?

10:38.815 --> 10:40.749
I thought it was a paparazzo,

10:40.817 --> 10:43.953
But it's just some loser
taking a picture of his kid.

10:44.020 --> 10:46.355
Oh...Right. Of course.

10:46.423 --> 10:48.757
That was fake.

10:48.825 --> 10:51.660
Did you know "paparazzo"
is singular to "paparazzi"?

10:51.728 --> 10:54.430
Kimiko taught me that.

10:54.497 --> 10:56.232
I'll see you at dawn so you can get caught

10:56.299 --> 10:57.266
coming out of my apartment.

10:57.334 --> 10:58.434
I'll loan you a shirt.

10:58.501 --> 11:00.002
Try to look like you just got drilled.

11:00.070 --> 11:01.437
You know the deal.

11:21.997 --> 11:24.832
Sir, this computer is not
helping with our search.

11:24.900 --> 11:27.502
If you type "Nancy's secrets"
into the internet,

11:27.569 --> 11:29.704
Do you have any idea what comes up?

11:29.772 --> 11:32.373
A store that sells wig extensions.

11:32.441 --> 11:33.975
I've seen all this before, Kenneth.

11:34.043 --> 11:36.010
The separate beds, the empty closets,

11:36.078 --> 11:37.545
The brave public face.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.581
This is just another Irish Catholic couple

11:40.649 --> 11:42.717
Who won't admit to the world
that their marriage is over.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.786
Sir, you don't know that.

11:44.853 --> 11:46.954
They're on vacation together right now.

11:47.022 --> 11:49.791
Are they?

11:49.858 --> 11:53.995
Nancy Donovan, still so organized.

11:54.063 --> 11:56.264
In German class, Mr. Kruger always chose her

11:56.331 --> 11:58.032
To sort the students.

11:58.100 --> 12:01.169
He was eventually arrested
by Israeli commandos.

12:01.236 --> 12:02.703
Hmm.

12:02.771 --> 12:04.138
Look.

12:04.206 --> 12:07.608
On the 30th she took flight 1470 to RSW.

12:07.676 --> 12:09.977
He left the next day for CVG.

12:10.045 --> 12:11.679
They have to be different cities.

12:11.747 --> 12:14.248
Uh, Fort Myers and Cincinnati.

12:14.316 --> 12:15.917
Did you not learn your
nation's airport codes

12:15.984 --> 12:17.051
in high school?

12:17.119 --> 12:19.520
She's at the beach house alone!

12:19.588 --> 12:21.422
That's the most divorced
sentence I've ever heard.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.514
Mr. Donaghy, this snooping has to stop.

12:23.582 --> 12:25.549
We came here to erase... oh!

12:25.617 --> 12:28.185
I just took a picture of both of us.

12:30.956 --> 12:33.324
Good morning. Is that glitter?

12:33.392 --> 12:35.760
Oh, my god, did you go out last night

12:35.827 --> 12:37.661
After I won the sleeping contest?

12:37.729 --> 12:39.663
I forgot to wash my face, didn't I?

12:39.731 --> 12:41.198
I meant to do it at the club,

12:41.266 --> 12:42.533
But when I got into the bathroom,

12:42.601 --> 12:43.901
Everything started up again.

12:43.969 --> 12:45.369
Okay, that's it, I am taking you

12:45.437 --> 12:47.371
To the Port Authority.

12:47.439 --> 12:49.206
To get on a bus home, not to meet people!

12:49.274 --> 12:51.709
God!

12:51.777 --> 12:54.245
Look, you've had your fun.
You've seen New York.

12:54.312 --> 12:57.181
You've made some really neat friends.

12:57.249 --> 13:01.419
Maybe that's enough for a first step. Okay?

13:01.486 --> 13:03.954
Yeah. Okay, you're right.

13:04.022 --> 13:05.956
But I'm not going home

13:06.024 --> 13:11.195
Until I give my cool cousin a makeover!

13:11.263 --> 13:12.897
i>- Is it gonna be fierce?

13:12.964 --> 13:14.532
It would be if it was 2006.

13:16.101 --> 13:18.269
Well, I do have this one cardigan

13:18.336 --> 13:20.237
That I've been kind of afraid to wear.

13:20.305 --> 13:21.472
Well, let's see it, girl.

13:24.543 --> 13:26.410
I'm not going back to Methenburg!

13:26.478 --> 13:29.013
Randy Lemon, you open this door right now!

13:30.182 --> 13:32.016
Okay, I do appreciate the irony

13:32.084 --> 13:34.218
That I'm the one stuck in the closet now.

13:34.286 --> 13:36.587
- Is that irony?
- Not really.

13:38.457 --> 13:39.782
The sun is up and we are
still in these people's home.

13:43.850 --> 13:45.183
God can see us now.

13:45.251 --> 13:47.285
We have to find that voice mail code.

13:47.353 --> 13:50.288
It's on the dry-erase board
above the phone.

13:50.356 --> 13:51.423
What?

13:51.491 --> 13:53.358
I saw it there a few hours ago.

13:53.426 --> 13:56.428
But I wasn't done looking around.

13:56.496 --> 13:59.331
I'm ready to hear the message now.

13:59.399 --> 14:01.066
Sir, I don't mean to swear,

14:01.134 --> 14:04.136
But I am irritated right now.

14:06.272 --> 14:09.107
5-5-2-8-7.

14:09.175 --> 14:11.243
Thursday, December 30...

14:11.310 --> 14:12.811
Thursday.

14:12.879 --> 14:14.113
Friday, January 1st.

14:14.181 --> 14:16.215
3:42 a.m.

14:16.283 --> 14:17.784
Meine liebe, Gretta,

14:17.851 --> 14:19.719
It's Klaus.

14:19.787 --> 14:22.221
Remember Mr. Kruger's German class?

14:22.289 --> 14:24.424
I took it to be with you.

14:24.491 --> 14:27.427
Sat behind you so I could talk to you

14:27.494 --> 14:29.662
And try to see the top of your underwear.

14:29.730 --> 14:33.733
You were Gretta and I was Klaus--

14:33.801 --> 14:35.034
Jack, are you coming in?

14:35.102 --> 14:37.403
I'm on the phone! Get back in the hot tub.

14:37.471 --> 14:40.673
Ballard, don't let them
put their tops back on.

14:40.741 --> 14:43.009
I'm going to say good night

14:43.077 --> 14:45.311
With help from the poet Rilke.

14:45.379 --> 14:47.413
Because only German can capture

14:47.481 --> 14:50.817
What seeing you again has made me feel.

14:50.884 --> 14:52.785
Aus unendlichen sehnsuchten

14:52.853 --> 14:57.457
Steigen endliche taten wie
schwache fontanen.

14:57.524 --> 14:58.758
Auf wiedersehen, Gretta.

15:00.826 --> 15:03.952
To erase, press seven. To save, press nine.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.422
For more options, press four.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.807
Sir, what are you doing? Erase it.

15:08.875 --> 15:09.942
I don't know.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.644
I thought I wanted a clean break,

15:11.711 --> 15:13.512
But if that message is how I really feel,

15:13.580 --> 15:15.080
Maybe she was supposed to hear it.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.715
Her marriage is falling apart.

15:16.783 --> 15:17.950
We meet again after all these years.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.685
Message deleted.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.854
Next message.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.889
Mr. Donaghy, whatever's happening here,

15:23.957 --> 15:27.026
It is not your place to interfere.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.061
If Mrs. Dougherty wanted you in her life,

15:29.129 --> 15:30.896
She would have called, given you some sign.

15:30.964 --> 15:34.466
But she hasn't. Let it go, sir.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.734
You're right, Kenneth.

15:35.802 --> 15:39.538
But you are leaving through the doggy door.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.473
Yes, sir.

15:49.554 --> 15:51.289
Hey, Liz, we're playing the
Today Show drinking game.

15:51.857 --> 15:54.892
You do a shot every time
they give a dumb travel tip.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.628
I like to take the shampoo

15:57.696 --> 15:59.864
And put it in the little
travel-size bottles.

15:59.932 --> 16:01.532
Then I take the original bottle

16:01.600 --> 16:02.834
And put it back in the shower...

16:02.901 --> 16:05.636
For later.
All: Yeah.

16:05.704 --> 16:07.305
Great.

16:07.373 --> 16:09.641
Liz, relationship emergency.

16:09.709 --> 16:12.143
Why are you wearing a
man's shirt and no pants?

16:12.211 --> 16:13.912
Last night, James kissed me.

16:13.980 --> 16:16.170
And for a second, I forgot it was fake.

16:17.238 --> 16:18.105
And it was incredible.

16:18.173 --> 16:20.974
Now having lunch with James and
the actress who plays my mom

16:21.042 --> 16:22.643
Somehow seems hollow.

16:22.710 --> 16:24.478
What's wrong with me?

16:24.546 --> 16:25.646
Jenna, what you're feeling is good.

16:25.713 --> 16:27.481
This thing with James is fun and exciting,

16:27.549 --> 16:28.482
But it isn't real.

16:28.550 --> 16:29.616
Deep down I think you want to be

16:29.684 --> 16:31.418
With someone you really love,

16:31.486 --> 16:33.454
And who can love you back.

16:33.521 --> 16:35.322
More friends on the plaza this morning.

16:35.390 --> 16:37.758
- Hi, guys. You celebrating?
- We're in love!

16:37.826 --> 16:39.626
Trent's quitting the navy,
and we're going to get married

16:39.694 --> 16:40.828
In Massachusetts.

16:40.895 --> 16:42.763
Wow. Congratulations.

16:42.831 --> 16:44.031
Oh, boy.

16:44.099 --> 16:45.966
If you want to save money on the trip,

16:46.034 --> 16:48.635
Consider taking a sandwich.

16:48.703 --> 16:49.937
Give 'em a hand.
All: Yeah.

16:52.740 --> 16:54.675
Hey, baby, you new here?

16:54.742 --> 16:56.677
- Yeah, this is my first show.
- Uh-huh.

16:56.744 --> 16:59.146
And before you worked here,
were you an ass scientist?

16:59.214 --> 17:00.214
Because your ass...

17:00.281 --> 17:01.815
Blah, blah, blah. You get the point.

17:01.883 --> 17:04.151
- So what's your name?
- Virginia.

17:04.219 --> 17:06.019
Virginia?

17:06.087 --> 17:07.621
But that's gonna be my daughter's name.

17:07.689 --> 17:11.023
- Are you also someone's daughter?
- Uh, yeah.

17:11.092 --> 17:12.992
Is every woman someone's daughter?

17:13.060 --> 17:15.229
- Of course.
- Uh-oh!

17:23.771 --> 17:26.906
No... way.

17:28.910 --> 17:31.578
I was wrong, sir. There is a sign.

17:31.646 --> 17:33.313
She's been thinking about you for years!

17:33.381 --> 17:35.038
Why can't you be more like Kenneth? Go on.

17:37.106 --> 17:39.109
Her code... 5-5-2-8-7.

17:39.276 --> 17:40.343
Do you know what it means?

17:40.411 --> 17:41.378
Well, it's not a date.

17:41.445 --> 17:42.679
The first numbers are too high.

17:42.747 --> 17:43.980
It's not the numbers, sir.

17:44.048 --> 17:46.583
It's the letters. They spell "Klaus."

17:46.650 --> 17:49.552
Your name in German class.

17:49.620 --> 17:53.990
The class you were in with Nancy...
In high school.

17:54.058 --> 17:56.326
- Back in Massachu... 
- I get it, Kenneth!

17:56.394 --> 17:57.527
I'm just trying to figure out my next move.

17:57.595 --> 17:58.595
I have to play it cool.

17:58.662 --> 17:59.929
You should buy a leather jacket!

17:59.997 --> 18:02.198
Get Cerie in here. Not you.

18:03.467 --> 18:06.236
Pack your stuff.

18:06.303 --> 18:09.606
You know, I don't think this
is about you protecting me.

18:09.673 --> 18:12.175
I think you have a problem with
people enjoying themselves.

18:12.243 --> 18:13.843
Why did you even leave White Haven, Liz?

18:13.911 --> 18:15.445
When was the last time
you watched the sun rise?

18:15.513 --> 18:17.180
Sometimes at work...

18:17.248 --> 18:19.115
- Or kissed a boy you just met?
- Gross.

18:19.183 --> 18:21.284
Or went dancing? I'm not going home

18:21.352 --> 18:23.353
Until I make you appreciate living here.

18:23.421 --> 18:26.289
Tonight we are gonna do
that makeover for real.

18:26.357 --> 18:28.057
And then I'm taking you out.

18:28.125 --> 18:30.960
Yeah, okay. Fine.

18:31.028 --> 18:32.262
I mean, who am I to tell Jenna

18:32.329 --> 18:34.230
That she doesn't know how to be happy

18:34.298 --> 18:36.466
- When I can't even figure out,,, 
- Stop. So bored.

18:36.534 --> 18:38.568
Did I do that right?

18:38.636 --> 18:43.206
Yeah. That was super bitchy.

18:43.274 --> 18:44.741
You can't just break up with me.

18:44.809 --> 18:46.676
I'll sue you for breach of contract!

18:46.744 --> 18:49.579
Oh, you're being such a
non-pillow right now!

18:49.647 --> 18:51.314
But don't you understand?

18:51.382 --> 18:53.906
I just want something
real in my life for once.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.241
I want what you have with Kimiko.

18:56.309 --> 18:59.912
Oh, Kimiko-tan...

18:59.979 --> 19:01.680
What am I doing, Jenna?

19:01.748 --> 19:04.416
Pretending to be something I'm not.

19:04.484 --> 19:06.585
Making myself miserable
when I've got happiness

19:06.653 --> 19:08.787
Waiting for me at home.

19:08.855 --> 19:10.456
Unless Kimiko's jealous of the ottoman.

19:10.523 --> 19:12.858
There's nothing going on there.
That's a business relationship.

19:12.926 --> 19:16.095
Don't Lemon your life, James.

19:16.162 --> 19:17.362
Be happy.

19:17.430 --> 19:20.299
I'm the actor James Franco, damn it!

19:20.366 --> 19:22.534
And I'm in love with and common-law married

19:22.602 --> 19:25.838
to a Japanese body pillow!

19:27.207 --> 19:29.608
And I hope you had a good New Year's.

19:29.676 --> 19:31.276
Let me know the next time you
and Mark are in New York,

19:31.344 --> 19:33.078
And we'll all grab dinner.

19:33.146 --> 19:35.681
Auf wiedersehen.

19:45.358 --> 19:46.291
Liz.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.626
- James.
- Wow.

19:47.694 --> 19:49.027
You look great.

19:49.095 --> 19:50.329
Is Jenna here?

19:50.396 --> 19:52.397
No, Jenna and I broke up, actually.

19:52.465 --> 19:54.133
We both decided it was time to be happy.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.802
Me too. I'm saying yes to life!

19:56.870 --> 20:00.305
Okay.

20:06.479 --> 20:10.516
Let's do this.

20:11.106 --> 20:13.674
Hey, you got home late.

20:13.742 --> 20:17.478
Yeah, I, um...

20:17.546 --> 20:19.513
Randy, this is James Franco

20:19.581 --> 20:22.750
And our friend Kimiko-Tan.

20:22.818 --> 20:25.553
Hey, Randy.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.021
I'm gonna go to the bus station.

20:27.089 --> 20:30.057
I think that's for the best.

20:32.188 --> 20:34.589
I blame you three for my unhealthy attitude

20:34.657 --> 20:35.590
towards women!

20:35.658 --> 20:37.392
You have created an atmosphere

20:37.459 --> 20:39.260
of hostility and intolerance

20:39.328 --> 20:41.307
that everyone talks about all the time.

20:41.308 --> 20:44.307
Griz, when is the last time you told
your fiance you loved her

20:45.004 --> 20:48.751
since the phone call I interrupted
to make this announcement?

20:49.018 --> 20:52.420
Kenneth, your haircut is
disrespectful to lesbians!

20:53.288 --> 20:56.090
Dotcom, do you ever read
books by women?

20:56.158 --> 20:58.059
But George Eliot was a woman.

20:58.127 --> 21:00.685
Enough! I've made a decision.

21:00.753 --> 21:02.854
And starting next week, I'm adding a woman

21:02.921 --> 21:04.188
To the entourage.

21:06.358 --> 21:07.458
Really?

21:08.305 --> 21:14.757
