DAMON: Previously on
The Vampire Diaries...

00:03.760 --> 00:06.684
Yes. Mrs. Sergeant Donovan.

00:08.920 --> 00:09.921
Penny!

00:10.760 --> 00:13.206
MATT; No. Oh, God! I killed her.

00:13.480 --> 00:16.689
- You can't blame yourself, Matt.
- I don't. I blame you.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.843
Look, if you wanna talk about Stefan,
it's okay, all right?

00:19.120 --> 00:20.690
CAROLINE: I didn't have anything to say
to him then,

00:20.840 --> 00:22.490
and I don't have anything
to say about him now.

00:22.680 --> 00:23.761
But there hasn't been any closure.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.002
- I don't need closure--
- No,ldo.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.601
ENZO: I need to know if the effects
of those pills can be reversed.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.609
The effects of my blood can't be reversed.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.611
That would mean you just gave the girl
you love a death sentence.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.042
You're on your last mortal life.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.283
We'd like to take that life,
and transfer it to Bonnie.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.722
Let another take up her burden.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.202
- DAMON: Wait, what?
- When she wakes, she'll be just like me.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.051

for you and your kind. (GASPS)

00:54.240 --> 00:55.401

00:55.960 --> 00:57.962
Right. Nice and slow.

H9)'-

01:02.160 --> 01:03.889
Nice and slow.

01:05.560 --> 01:06.561
Hey-

01:07.040 --> 01:08.405
How you feeling?

01:10.320 --> 01:12.766
I don't know. I just feel different.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.249
Considering you were on death's door,
that's probably a good thing.

01:17.560 --> 01:21.167
Okay, here's how I'm feeling,
I'm thirsty and starving.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.003
- I'm on it.
- I'll get you a glass of water.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.201
Okay.

01:27.840 --> 01:28.887
Hey-

01:30.880 --> 01:34.168
Actually, I think I want a bourbon, neat.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.405
Now that's the girl I love.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.041
Right.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.200
What shall we drink to, then?

01:50.040 --> 01:51.530

02:21.320 --> 02:22.970
Nothing's happening, mate.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.331
That's the problem.
Bonnie won't wake up.

02:37.560 --> 02:39.324
Rayna screwed us.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.002
She failed to mention that
by giving Bonnie her life,

02:42.160 --> 02:44.003
she was actually giving Bonnie
her lifestyle.

02:44.280 --> 02:47.329
So now, when Bonnie wakes up,
she's gonna be Rayna 2.0.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.688
And does that gift
begin with a very long nap?

02:49.920 --> 02:52.287
I didn't get a chance to ask
as she burst into flames.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.489
And before you ask,
no, I did not get a chance

02:54.680 --> 02:57.684
to interrogate her little shaman friend,
because he vanished at the same time.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.605
- Damon, did the spell work or not?
- I don't know, Enzo.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.603
I have no idea why she's not waking up.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.161
(SIGHS)

03:05.320 --> 03:07.687
And the least she could do
to thank us for saving her life

03:07.840 --> 03:10.684
is just open her eyes, let us know
whether or not she wants to murder us.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.602
- What if she doesn't?
- What?

03:15.040 --> 03:16.610
You know her as well as I do.

03:17.960 --> 03:20.850
Waking up means she'll have to kill us.

03:21.440 --> 03:25.047
So, what if the reason Bonnie isn't
waking up is because she's Bonnie.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.326
CAROLINE: She's better off in here,
don't you think?

03:30.800 --> 03:34.725
Here, it's quieter, and more peaceful.
Did you grab those scented candles?

03:36.720 --> 03:38.848
- Not exactly.
- No.

03:39.640 --> 03:42.644
- No, we are not going to do this.
- You heard what Damon said.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.041
- If she wakes up, you're gonna get--
- When she wakes up.

03:45.320 --> 03:47.687
We do not know what she's going to be
or how she's going to feel,

03:47.840 --> 03:49.649
and if we chain her up,
we've made that decision for her.

03:49.840 --> 03:53.640
Okay, fine, no chains.
But then, I'm not leaving.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.921
Ric...

03:56.400 --> 03:58.641
Your flight's in an hour.
It's the last flight out tonight.

And Lizzie and Josie have been
stuck with a sitter for two days now.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.528
I know. But if this goes the wrong way,

04:03.760 --> 04:06.411
I'm the one person Bonnie's not
gonna wanna kill on sight, okay?

04:06.680 --> 04:08.330
I should be here, with you.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.762
While our 3-year-old children
are in a different time zone?

04:11.040 --> 04:13.042
Okay, then you get on the plane.
Let me stay here and help.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.884
That's the safest,
most logical plan, anyway.

04:15.200 --> 04:18.726
I am the single best person
for Bonnie to see when she wakes up.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.842
And you are the single best person for
our girls to see when they wake up.

04:24.200 --> 04:28.285
Take the flight.
I'll be home as soon as I can, I promise.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.044
I'm gonna hold you to that promise.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.125

you didn't want to be disturbed,

05:04.080 --> 05:05.650
but is there a break in Penny's case?

05:07.480 --> 05:09.642
Yeah, it turns out it was an accident.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.085
- You need something, Deputy?
- Yeah.

05:15.320 --> 05:18.290
You wanted to be notified if there was
any activity over at the Salvatore House.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.130
Seem to be some squatters tonight.
Do you want me to go over there and--

05:22.320 --> 05:23.401
No, I'll take care of it.

05:30.280 --> 05:32.681
- What do you want, Damon?
- Do you never check your voicemail?

05:32.920 --> 05:35.526
- I've left you about nine messages.
- Yeah, sorry, I've been a little busy

05:35.680 --> 05:37.762
telling Matt Donovan he's the reason
his fiancée is dead.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.970
- Ooh. Do I even wanna know how that went?
- Probably not.

05:41.240 --> 05:44.369
You also probably don't wanna know
how screwed you are with Bonnie, either.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.001
I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number,
because I dialed "H" for Hero.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.282
Clock's ticking, brother.
You need to get your head in the game.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.284
My head is in the game, Damon.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.490
My life was blown apart when I was marked
by Rayna's sword, you remember that?

05:54.680 --> 05:56.523
I had to leave everything I loved behind
and run for years.

05:56.760 --> 05:59.047
So, as much as I want Bonnie to wake up,

05:59.200 --> 06:01.885
I'm not exactly looking forward
to doing that again.

06:02.040 --> 06:05.123
All right, all right, I get it.
You don't have any ideas. I don't either.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.962
This conversation just got
really depressing.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.204
Well, I never said I didn't have an idea.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.170
Rayna used to say that she had to kill me,
but she didn't want to.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.041
She could sense my humanity
through some sort of psychic link.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.727
So, if Bonnie's fighting the same war
in her head,

06:22.000 --> 06:23.411
we need to give her some ammunition.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.120
What? So, one of us needs to
delve into her subconscious,

06:26.320 --> 06:28.129
and do what, exactly?

06:28.360 --> 06:29.805
Convince her hunter-brain

06:30.000 --> 06:32.571
that not all vampires are selfish,
vicious monsters,

06:33.640 --> 06:36.086
which is exactly why I'm the worst person
for the job.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.247
She's my girl. I'll do it.

06:40.320 --> 06:41.731
No. It should be me.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.688
I was her best friend
before I was a vampire.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.002
I can show her the difference
between the two.

06:49.320 --> 06:50.765
She's right.

06:56.680 --> 06:57.681

I just wanted to see
if you needed anything.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.366
You wanna be helpful?
Then do your thing and run away,

07:08.680 --> 07:10.250
so I can focus on my friend.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.601
Okay. I can take a hint.

you were not paying attention.

is hanging on by a thread.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.528
And I'm about to use my vampire powers

13:01.680 --> 13:03.284
to try to find a loophole
in her subconscious,

13:03.440 --> 13:04.965
knowing full well that if I fail,

13:05.120 --> 13:06.884
I'll be forever marked for death
at her hands.

She wouldn't be in this situation
if it weren't for you and Damon.

13:10.360 --> 13:11.964
It's an endless cycle. Penny knew that.

- Yeah?

25:23.800 --> 25:27.805
Look, when I went
to go find you in Dallas,

25:28.480 --> 25:29.641
here's what I saw,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.321
I saw you and Ric and the kids.

25:32.840 --> 25:35.446
And you were happy.
And you know what I didn't see?

25:35.720 --> 25:36.721
Me.

25:37.440 --> 25:40.046
So I convinced myself
that I was doing right by you,

25:40.520 --> 25:43.444
even though I had no idea
of what I was doing.

25:45.720 --> 25:46.846
I'm sorry.

25:47.800 --> 25:51.361
And you have every right to hate me
for what I did to you three years ago.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.689
And three hours ago.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.802
Just don't pretend
that you would act any differently.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.369
You're doing the same thing
with Bonnie right now.

26:00.680 --> 26:03.047
You can't accept a world
where Bonnie dies.

26:03.720 --> 26:06.246
Even though that's a choice
that she's trying to make for herself.

26:06.800 --> 26:09.644
And you know why?
Because you love her too much.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.365
And there's nothing wrong with that.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.646
And I love you.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.730
And the thought of you getting hurt,

26:21.080 --> 26:22.730
it's not an option
that I'm willing to entertain.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.047
You hurt me.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.202
More than anyone else has ever hurt me.

26:33.360 --> 26:36.443
-and you left me.
- I know.

26:37.280 --> 26:41.205
All I can do is say that I'm sorry,
and I hope that you'll forgive me one day.

You know everything I said was just a ploy
to make you wake up, right?

27:50.480 --> 27:53.006
Really? Is that why you're running
through the woods scared?

- Not only can I see you,

27:59.200 --> 28:00.884
but I can sense what you're feeling.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.849
Which is how I know deep down,
there's a part of you

28:03.080 --> 28:05.048
that meant what you said to me
on Elena's porch.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.442
Hey, I said what I said to save your life.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.682
It's not the first time
I've saved your bacon, by the way.

28:10.880 --> 28:12.689
Don't actions speak louder than words?

28:13.000 --> 28:14.809
The only reason you saved me,
time and time again,

28:15.040 --> 28:18.601
is because you believe that if you didn't,
Elena would never forgive you.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.843
A conundrum that you're now familiar with,

28:21.040 --> 28:23.930
because if you kill me,
Elena will never forgive you.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.241
That's the thing, Damon.

-(RAIN FALLING)
- From there?

38:08.040 --> 38:09.451
I have no idea.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.168
But, I will figure it out when I have to.

38:13.560 --> 38:16.484
You can't keep
putting these decisions off.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.801
Fine. Uh, from Maine,

38:23.040 --> 38:25.407
we will take the ferry to Nova Scotia.

38:25.760 --> 38:28.411
Happy? If not, feel free to swim.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.250
I wasn't talking about that decision.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.205
Do you love him?

38:48.280 --> 38:49.566
I don't know.

38:50.720 --> 38:53.451
Can you love someone
and leave them behind,

38:53.640 --> 38:55.369
right when you need each other the most?

39:01.960 --> 39:03.450
Just don't.

39:03.920 --> 39:07.766
Ask me whatever you want about directions,
and travel plans,

39:07.960 --> 39:10.167
and anything related to Bonnie.

39:11.440 --> 39:12.965
Those decisions I can make.

39:14.360 --> 39:15.600
Ric and me?

39:17.800 --> 39:20.246
Just please don't ask me
to make that choice right now.

39:35.800 --> 39:36.961
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

39:43.920 --> 39:44.921
(GRUNTS)

39:45.200 --> 39:46.440
(TIRES SCREECHING)

39:48.760 --> 39:50.125
(BOTH GRUNTING)

39:50.960 --> 39:53.281
(STRAINING) Bonnie, I'm here to help you.

39:54.680 --> 39:56.284
(STRUGGLING)

40:09.240 --> 40:10.241
(DOOR OPENS)

40:11.160 --> 40:12.810
(GOTH ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

40:13.160 --> 40:15.322
ENZO: Mind if I join you?
DAMON: Help yourself.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.009
But this isn't a celebration.

40:18.520 --> 40:21.000
Bonnie's alive.
That's all that matters to me.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.170
I couldn't get through to her.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.522
I would've been
just another notch on her belt

40:27.680 --> 40:29.205
if Matt Donovan hadn't stepped in.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.448
ENZO: Well, as much as
it pains me to say it,

40:31.680 --> 40:33.250
Matt was the man of the match tonight.

40:33.760 --> 40:36.366
He found a lead on the shaman
who helped Rayna turn Bonnie.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.801
It turns out
that shaman was quite willing to talk

40:39.160 --> 40:41.527
once he had a good look
at his own entrails.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.480
- Tell me you have a way to help her.
- Maybe.

40:46.080 --> 40:47.491
Maybe not.

40:58.040 --> 41:01.408
Bonnie's life is linked to that
of the final Everlasting.

41:04.040 --> 41:07.249
If we sever the link,
it might also sever the curse.

41:09.240 --> 41:12.722
Unfortunately, for us,
the Everlasting resides in the Armory.

41:14.080 --> 41:18.130
Yeah, in a coffin. In a forever nap.
Piece of cake.

41:20.080 --> 41:23.482
Uh... You're forgetting why Bonnie,
the good witch,

41:23.680 --> 41:25.011
sealed the whole building shut.

41:25.600 --> 41:28.285
The evil in the basement
escaped from its vault,

41:28.480 --> 41:30.403
and now it could be anywhere
in that bloody maze.

41:33.480 --> 41:34.925
Well, evil be damned.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.050
We're gonna open the place back up.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.601
GUARD: Please. Make it stop.

42:25.720 --> 42:26.767
