WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:03.101
Oh, good, you're here.

00:03.168 --> 00:04.869
I know things have been
a little slow lately,

00:04.937 --> 00:06.171
but I have made a decision

00:06.238 --> 00:08.006
that is going to change
our business

00:08.074 --> 00:09.307
in a profound way.

00:09.375 --> 00:10.575
You're getting
out of clocks

00:10.642 --> 00:12.610
and into something
that makes sense.

00:12.678 --> 00:13.578
SALEM:
I got it.

00:13.646 --> 00:15.313
Designer cat food.

00:15.381 --> 00:17.381
No, and fat chance, Tubby.

00:17.449 --> 00:18.983
I have something
in the store room

00:19.051 --> 00:20.652
that is going to have
a line of customers

00:20.720 --> 00:22.120
snaking around the block.

00:22.187 --> 00:24.288
Ta-da!

00:24.356 --> 00:26.590
Well, I'm sure I
speak for everyone

00:26.658 --> 00:28.993
when I say
"creepy."

00:29.061 --> 00:34.933
Well, there'll certainly be
a nice deduction come tax time.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.634
All right, I'll give you
one more chance.

00:36.702 --> 00:38.903
Salem, what do you think?

00:38.971 --> 00:40.405
Let me be delicate.

00:40.473 --> 00:42.373
Those clocks are awful.

00:42.441 --> 00:43.841
Is that so?

00:43.909 --> 00:46.010
I-I mean awful good.

00:46.979 --> 00:48.747
Look over there.

00:48.815 --> 00:50.915
No, over there!
No, over there!

00:50.983 --> 00:54.519
(whimpering):
Oh, change me back
or take me to Wimbledon.

01:28.521 --> 01:30.388
So, are you buying a new dress
for the Snowflake Ball?

01:30.455 --> 01:31.856
No, I've already got
plenty that are fine

01:31.924 --> 01:33.591
for loitering awkwardly
around the punch bowl

01:33.659 --> 01:35.226
and that's all Harvey and I
ever do at those things.

01:35.294 --> 01:36.827
P.A. ANNOUNCER:
Your attention, please.

01:36.895 --> 01:40.765
The finalists for the King and
Queen of the Snowflake Ball are:

01:40.833 --> 01:43.234
Gracie Charters and Dan Kael,

01:43.302 --> 01:45.904
Jean Huang and Hans Tercek,

01:45.971 --> 01:49.440
and Sabrina Spellman
and Harvey Kinkle.

01:49.508 --> 01:51.510
You know, I've won
lots of academic prizes,

01:51.577 --> 01:53.011
but never anything
as meaningless

01:53.079 --> 01:54.879
as a popularity contest.

01:54.947 --> 01:56.981
Do you think Harvey and I
have a shot?

01:57.049 --> 01:58.516
Well, they say
the cutest couple always wins.

01:58.583 --> 02:00.985
But those girls are really cute.

02:01.053 --> 02:02.420
You and Harvey are cute, too.

02:02.487 --> 02:03.788
Right. We'll just be ourselves

02:03.855 --> 02:05.556
and let the chips fall
where they may,

02:05.624 --> 02:06.991
and I'll just take
the high road.

02:07.059 --> 02:08.226
But while I'm taking it,

02:08.293 --> 02:10.228
I may as well do it
in a killer new dress.

02:10.294 --> 02:12.596
Zelda, I've got bad news.

02:12.664 --> 02:16.568
Uh-oh, is Salem running
five minutes fast again?

02:16.635 --> 02:17.969
No, I just found out

02:18.037 --> 02:20.572
that one of those gigantic
Everything Emporium stores

02:20.639 --> 02:22.406
is going to open
outside of town.

02:22.474 --> 02:24.509
Oh, one of those great
discount places?

02:24.576 --> 02:26.911
They have a huge selection
of clothing

02:26.979 --> 02:27.845
and appliances and...

02:27.913 --> 02:29.581
(gasps):
clocks.

02:29.648 --> 02:31.682
And I really love
this place.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.418
I was hoping to struggle
for a few years

02:33.486 --> 02:35.553
and then file for Chapter 11.

02:35.621 --> 02:36.921
Oh, Hilda, don't overreact.

02:36.988 --> 02:38.556
It's probably just a rumor.

02:41.260 --> 02:44.095
Do you want to start
boarding up the windows

02:44.162 --> 02:45.430
or should I?

02:45.498 --> 02:47.398
Hey, Josh, do you think
I'd look good in this dress?

02:47.466 --> 02:49.734
I mean, you can't see the
outline of <i>my</i> liver, though.

02:49.801 --> 02:52.870
Why do women do
this to themselves?

02:52.938 --> 02:54.572
Sabrina, you're smart,
you're beautiful.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.907
Tell me, what does this girl
have that you don't?

02:56.975 --> 02:58.509
You mean
besides millions of dollars

02:58.577 --> 03:00.011
and an abusive
rock-star boyfriend?

03:00.079 --> 03:01.446
That's what's wrong
with our society.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.748
See, we emphasize beauty
to such a degree,

03:03.816 --> 03:06.318
it's downright unhealthy.

03:06.385 --> 03:08.686
Hey, look,
a pill to stop hair loss.

03:09.588 --> 03:10.755
Hey, Salem.

03:10.823 --> 03:12.691
Want to see the dress
that's going to get me elected

03:12.758 --> 03:14.058
Queen of the Snowflake Ball?

03:14.126 --> 03:15.326
Put it on.

03:15.393 --> 03:17.995
But I should warn you,
I can be catty.

03:21.533 --> 03:24.035
It's the only one they had;
isn't it perfect?

03:24.103 --> 03:25.870
Except for the fact
that it's one size too small.

03:25.938 --> 03:27.171
I see.

03:27.239 --> 03:30.341
In your world "perfect"
means "doesn't fit."

03:30.409 --> 03:32.377
And since it's an
Other Realm original,

03:32.445 --> 03:33.544
it can't be altered.

03:33.612 --> 03:35.513
Really? Now I know why
the Other Realm

03:35.581 --> 03:37.882
trails behind Paris
as the fashion capital.

03:37.949 --> 03:40.151
Okay, well,
if I can't alter the dress,

03:40.219 --> 03:41.352
I'll alter myself.

03:41.420 --> 03:42.621
I'll diet.

03:42.688 --> 03:44.656
I've never done it before,
but how hard can it be?

03:44.723 --> 03:46.924
Yeah, the fact that
weight-loss products

03:46.992 --> 03:48.593
comprise
a billion-dollar industry

03:48.694 --> 03:50.495
is probably
just a funny coincidence.

03:51.730 --> 03:52.497
Good morning,
Sabrina.

03:52.564 --> 03:53.898
How would you
like your eggs?

03:53.966 --> 03:55.566
Oh, as far away
from me as possible.

03:55.668 --> 03:57.569
I'm on a diet
so I can fit in my new dress

03:57.637 --> 03:59.771
and be elected
Queen of the Snowflake Ball.

03:59.838 --> 04:01.472
Hmm, and if you go down
two dress sizes,

04:01.540 --> 04:03.608
you can get into an
Ivy League school.

04:03.676 --> 04:05.510
You're fine just
the way you are.

04:05.578 --> 04:06.677
Fine?

04:06.745 --> 04:07.711
Harvey and I are competing

04:07.779 --> 04:09.280
with two other
really cute couples.

04:09.348 --> 04:10.815
Fine is going to come in third.

04:10.883 --> 04:11.916
Well, at least let me give you

04:11.984 --> 04:13.350
one of these
whole-grain muffins.

04:13.418 --> 04:14.452
Oh, come on.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.120
Think of chewing as
an aerobic exercise.

04:21.260 --> 04:24.662
Ugh... just holding this muffin
is making me feel bloated.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.064
Huh?

04:26.131 --> 04:27.331
(munching)

04:27.399 --> 04:30.234
One man's trash, baby.

04:31.770 --> 04:34.004
One, two, three, <i>four,</i>

04:34.072 --> 04:37.341
their prices are low,
but their morals are lower!

04:37.409 --> 04:39.076
Well, once again,
you're overreacting.

04:39.144 --> 04:41.812
Overreacting gets results!

04:41.881 --> 04:45.249
I am simply exercising
my right to free speech.

04:45.317 --> 04:47.051
Uh-huh, and the
rotten fruit?

04:47.119 --> 04:48.519
Visual aids.

04:48.587 --> 04:50.555
Hilda, I've made
an appointment for you

04:50.623 --> 04:52.323
with the president
of the Everything Emporium

04:52.390 --> 04:54.124
to sit down
and discuss the matter,

04:54.192 --> 04:56.927
if you'd like to try
the mature approach.

04:56.995 --> 05:00.765
Fine. I just hope I can
return that cow manure.

05:00.832 --> 05:02.166
What are the odds
that the cafeteria

05:02.233 --> 05:03.368
would have the bacon
cheeseburgers

05:03.435 --> 05:04.869
and chocolate sundaes
on the same day?

05:04.937 --> 05:08.439
I know, it's like winning
the lottery.

05:08.507 --> 05:10.408
Did you misplace
your entree?

05:10.476 --> 05:12.343
No. I'm trying
to lose weight,

05:12.411 --> 05:14.512
so I can fit
in my new dress.

05:14.580 --> 05:15.679
The dress that's going
to make us a lock

05:15.747 --> 05:16.915
for King and Queen.

05:16.982 --> 05:18.716
Good. So we're both
doing our part.

05:18.784 --> 05:20.251
What's yours, eating
like Henry VIII?

05:20.319 --> 05:24.088
Don't pretend like you
haven't noticed my mustache.

05:24.156 --> 05:26.157
Oh, I see it.

05:27.626 --> 05:28.926
No, that's just a shadow.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.163
(low gurgling)

05:32.230 --> 05:35.400
Does anyone else hear that
strange buzzing sound?

05:35.467 --> 05:36.667
Yes.

05:36.735 --> 05:39.670
Like the low hum
of an incoming B-52.

05:39.738 --> 05:41.172
Are we at war?

05:41.239 --> 05:42.473
(low gurgling)

05:42.541 --> 05:44.475
Uh, you know I think
it's that darn sophomore

05:44.543 --> 05:45.643
with the deviated septum.

05:45.710 --> 05:47.345
He must have closed
his mouth again.

05:47.412 --> 05:49.079
Sabrina,
could you come up here?

05:50.382 --> 05:53.284
I think I might have
an antacid.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.119
What flavor?
Can I have two?

05:55.187 --> 05:56.854
I always carry
the essentials.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.825
Let's see.

06:00.893 --> 06:04.529
No, that one's for leprosy.

06:06.765 --> 06:08.399
So, thanks for taking time out
of your busy schedule

06:08.466 --> 06:09.667
to meet with me.

06:09.735 --> 06:11.836
Hand me that towel,
will you?

06:11.904 --> 06:14.238
(phone rings)
What?

06:14.306 --> 06:15.439
Fire him.

06:15.507 --> 06:17.775
Your son?
He's not a closer.

06:17.842 --> 06:21.446
Anyway, I hoped
if I could tell you

06:21.514 --> 06:23.014
what a wonderful place
my clock shop is,

06:23.081 --> 06:26.350
you would find it in your heart
to spare it.

06:26.418 --> 06:28.486
(chuckling):
That's a good one.

06:28.553 --> 06:29.620
Spare it!

06:29.688 --> 06:32.590
Oh, who sent you in here,
huh? Artie?

06:34.159 --> 06:35.359
You're serious, aren't you?

06:35.427 --> 06:37.928
You really think there's
anything you could tell me

06:37.996 --> 06:40.264
to keep me from squashing you
like a bug?

06:40.332 --> 06:43.634
We put a lot of effort into
our selection of timepieces.

06:43.702 --> 06:44.735
Oh, well, in that case,

06:44.803 --> 06:46.203
I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

06:46.271 --> 06:47.805
I'm going to count
all the way to three

06:47.873 --> 06:49.340
before I call security.

06:49.407 --> 06:52.710
Before I go, could I just make
one little point?

06:57.982 --> 07:00.551
Oh, look who's been downsized.

07:00.618 --> 07:01.619
This stinks.

07:01.686 --> 07:03.287
I've been dieting
for a whole half a day

07:03.355 --> 07:04.722
and I haven't even
lost a pound.

07:04.789 --> 07:06.857
Sabrina, I found that
the key to losing weight

07:06.925 --> 07:08.660
is eating the right foods.

07:08.727 --> 07:09.760
Who are you channeling?

07:09.829 --> 07:11.529
The other day I saw you
put sugar on bacon.

07:11.596 --> 07:13.230
<i>Lean</i> bacon.

07:13.298 --> 07:14.598
There's got to be
something in here

07:14.666 --> 07:16.200
that will help me
fit in my dress.

07:16.268 --> 07:17.202
Hey, look at this ad.

07:17.269 --> 07:18.403
"Thanks to Blubber-Be-Gone,

07:18.470 --> 07:19.903
I lost 50 pounds
in three days."

07:19.971 --> 07:20.905
That's ridiculous.

07:20.973 --> 07:22.206
What'd he do, lop off a leg?

07:22.273 --> 07:23.341
Here goes.

07:23.409 --> 07:24.675
"Thin my thighs,
lose my roll,

07:24.743 --> 07:26.610
make me skinnier
than Manute Bol."

07:27.679 --> 07:30.315
Ooh!

07:30.382 --> 07:31.615
I see you called me
in the nick of time.

07:31.683 --> 07:32.817
I did?

07:32.885 --> 07:35.419
Losing weight the Blubber-
Be-Gone way is easy.

07:35.487 --> 07:36.821
Whenever you're hungry,

07:36.888 --> 07:38.456
instead of eating food,

07:38.524 --> 07:40.591
just mix yourself a shake.

07:43.261 --> 07:45.363
Taste?

07:47.533 --> 07:49.968
Not bad;
although I still prefer ipecac.

07:50.035 --> 07:52.770
SALEM:
Excuse me,
but I think we've met before.

07:52.838 --> 07:54.105
Weren't you selling

07:54.172 --> 07:56.607
that turn-your-eye-gunk-
into-gold kit a few years ago?

07:56.674 --> 07:59.376
No, that must have been
my brother.

07:59.444 --> 08:00.778
Happy dieting.

08:01.947 --> 08:03.647
This is great.

08:03.715 --> 08:05.015
I'm going to lose weight,

08:05.083 --> 08:07.217
I'm going to look fantastic
in my new special dress,

08:07.285 --> 08:08.853
and I'll be elected
queen of the ball.

08:08.921 --> 08:09.954
Right.

08:10.021 --> 08:11.189
And one of these days,

08:11.256 --> 08:13.457
my pink eye
is going to pay off big.

08:13.525 --> 08:14.425
Oh, no.

08:14.493 --> 08:16.827
Woman's pump at 10:00.

08:17.863 --> 08:19.964
Oh, so how does it feel
being the, uh...

08:20.032 --> 08:20.965
little guy?

08:21.032 --> 08:22.467
What's that?

08:22.534 --> 08:22.934
Earthquake?

08:23.001 --> 08:24.802
Mm. Mm. Mm.

08:27.172 --> 08:28.406
Blech!

08:28.474 --> 08:31.242
And now,
for the moment of truth.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.376
It fits!

08:33.445 --> 08:34.645
The shakes worked.

08:35.614 --> 08:37.347
Hi, there.

08:37.416 --> 08:39.717
I thought you might like
to try our new flavors.

08:39.784 --> 08:45.056
Gaunt grape
and lean, mean nectarine.

08:45.123 --> 08:46.857
Thanks, but I lost
all the weight I had to.

08:46.925 --> 08:48.726
I don't need any more shakes.

08:48.794 --> 08:50.194
You really think so?

08:50.262 --> 08:52.697
You guys must work
on commission.

08:52.764 --> 08:54.565
As you can plainly see,

08:54.633 --> 08:56.000
I... (gasps)

08:56.068 --> 08:56.834
look awful.

08:56.902 --> 08:58.102
I'll take two cases.

08:58.169 --> 09:00.104
Quick, before the firemen
have to come

09:00.171 --> 09:01.806
and cut me out of my bedroom.

09:01.873 --> 09:03.607
Hey, by the way,
how did your meeting go

09:03.675 --> 09:05.443
with the president
of Everything Emporium?

09:05.510 --> 09:06.744
Not bad.

09:06.811 --> 09:08.146
At first, it wasn't going well,

09:08.213 --> 09:12.050
but then he had, uh...
metamorphoses.

09:12.117 --> 09:13.951
Either you're up to something,
or...

09:14.019 --> 09:15.152
No, that's it.

09:15.220 --> 09:17.287
You're up to something.

09:21.226 --> 09:23.661
Mmm, Sabrina, you've got
to try these croissants.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.529
They're just like
Grandma used to make.

09:25.597 --> 09:26.864
Well, not my grandma,

09:26.931 --> 09:29.333
but someone's grandma
who knew how to bake.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.401
No, thanks.

09:30.469 --> 09:32.336
I had a raisin earlier
and, boy, am I stuffed.

09:32.404 --> 09:34.105
Sabrina, you're looking
awfully skinny.

09:34.172 --> 09:35.940
You're not still on
that diet, are you?

09:36.007 --> 09:37.141
Me? No, I'm fine.

09:37.242 --> 09:40.044
Hey, do I see
a little scalp up there?

09:40.112 --> 09:41.345
(gasps)

09:43.982 --> 09:45.549
(gasps)

09:45.617 --> 09:48.152
Don't tell me.

09:48.219 --> 09:49.854
I've inherited the Spellman gene

09:49.922 --> 09:51.956
for a keister
the size of Manhattan.

09:53.525 --> 09:55.626
Oh, I knew it.

09:55.693 --> 09:58.062
It was just some sort of spell.

09:58.130 --> 10:01.899
And yet the insecurity
about my butt won't go away.

10:05.003 --> 10:07.171
I think it's time
to bring back suspenders.

10:07.239 --> 10:09.240
Sabrina, we have to talk.

10:09.308 --> 10:10.441
Oh, well,
I only have a little while

10:10.509 --> 10:11.909
before Harvey picks me up
for the dance

10:11.977 --> 10:14.178
and your stern lectures
tend to eat up the clock.

10:14.246 --> 10:15.913
Not only are these
things a scam,

10:15.981 --> 10:18.415
but they can cause
serious side effects.

10:18.483 --> 10:19.517
But I have to lose weight.

10:19.584 --> 10:22.019
Like making you think
you have to lose weight.

10:22.087 --> 10:23.587
Come here, look
in the mirror.

10:23.655 --> 10:24.655
No, not the mirror!

10:24.723 --> 10:26.357
It's so cruel
and unforgiving!

10:26.425 --> 10:27.458
Not anymore.

10:27.526 --> 10:29.327
That creepy salesman
put a spell on it,

10:29.394 --> 10:30.761
but I deactivated it. See?

10:30.829 --> 10:32.329
What are you talking about?

10:32.397 --> 10:34.866
It's like looking at a picture
of William Howard Taft.

10:34.933 --> 10:36.200
Oh, no.

10:36.267 --> 10:38.302
All this dieting has affected
you psychologically.

10:38.369 --> 10:39.704
You can't see that
you're so thin,

10:39.771 --> 10:41.105
you're practically sick.

10:41.172 --> 10:43.040
Oh, well, what good
is my health if I'm not Queen?

10:43.107 --> 10:44.876
No more shakes.

10:44.943 --> 10:48.012
Fine! Force me to live
with this obscene obesity.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.781
You know,
Aunt Zelda is so unfair.

10:50.849 --> 10:53.083
I know
it seems unfair now,

10:53.151 --> 10:55.053
but someday
when you're older and wiser,

10:55.120 --> 10:56.987
you'll be able to look back
on all this

10:57.089 --> 10:59.523
and get revenge.

11:03.061 --> 11:06.096
Hey... one more shake
wouldn't hurt

11:06.164 --> 11:09.500
and it would be wrong to waste
perfectly good guar gum.

11:09.567 --> 11:12.602
Hilda, here's
an interesting news item.

11:12.670 --> 11:15.973
"Everything Emporium
president missing."

11:16.041 --> 11:17.407
Oh, look, Larry King

11:17.475 --> 11:19.343
likes the new
Ludlum novel.

11:19.410 --> 11:21.679
Did you have anything
to do with this?

11:21.746 --> 11:24.949
No. Robert Ludlum
has his own publicist.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.484
Oh, you mean the Everything
Emporium president?

11:27.552 --> 11:31.755
Yes. He was bugging me,
so I turned him into one.

11:31.823 --> 11:33.090
Ginger beer?

11:33.158 --> 11:34.157
A bug?

11:34.225 --> 11:36.426
Hilda, you've got
to change him back.

11:36.494 --> 11:39.096
He is in a perfectly humane
situation...

11:42.100 --> 11:44.501
...now that I gave him
air holes.

11:44.569 --> 11:47.271
SABRINA:
I wonder if that last milk shake
made any difference.

11:47.339 --> 11:49.206
I certainly feel lighter.

11:49.274 --> 11:51.708
Salem, help!
I've disappeared!

11:51.777 --> 11:53.177
(gasps):
I'm so sorry.

11:53.244 --> 11:57.147
Hey, twirl me around
so it looks like I'm flying.

12:00.986 --> 12:02.286
SABRINA:
What's happened?!
Where am I?!

12:02.354 --> 12:04.654
You've dieted until
you've disappeared.

12:04.722 --> 12:07.324
Now I'm starting to wonder
if you can be too rich.

12:10.495 --> 12:12.629
There has to be a potion
in here somewhere.

12:12.697 --> 12:15.132
You need
an Other Realm camera.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.701
Everyone knows those cameras
add a hundred pounds.

12:17.769 --> 12:18.936
(doorbell rings)

12:19.003 --> 12:20.003
That's Harvey!

12:20.071 --> 12:21.872
Order me a camera, now!

12:21.940 --> 12:23.173
Come on, Sabrina.

12:23.241 --> 12:25.375
We're not going to be able

12:25.443 --> 12:28.445
to vote for ourselves
if we're late.

12:33.952 --> 12:36.319
Self-opening door?

12:36.387 --> 12:37.688
Cool.

12:37.756 --> 12:40.190
Not very safe, but cool.

12:40.258 --> 12:42.026
(running footfalls)

12:47.232 --> 12:48.799
Has the camera
arrived yet?

12:48.867 --> 12:51.135
Yes!

12:51.202 --> 12:53.738
Finally. Hurry up
and take my picture.

12:53.805 --> 12:56.807
Could we take
another one?

12:56.875 --> 12:59.477
I think your eyes were closed.

12:59.544 --> 13:03.347
Sabrina, I'm down here
when you're ready!

13:03.415 --> 13:05.916
And sorry to anyone I woke up.

13:05.984 --> 13:07.518
SABRINA:
I'll be right there.

13:07.586 --> 13:10.754
Okay, everything's going
to be fine.

13:10.822 --> 13:12.155
Uh-oh.

13:12.223 --> 13:15.258
You think that happened because
we didn't use name-brand film?

13:15.326 --> 13:17.495
Oh, look, it says the camera
only brings you back

13:17.562 --> 13:19.062
for a few minutes.

13:19.130 --> 13:21.565
So much for "Take a picture,
it'll last longer."

13:21.633 --> 13:22.767
And you'll start to flicker

13:22.834 --> 13:24.534
whenever you're
about to disappear.

13:26.204 --> 13:27.471
Like that.

13:27.539 --> 13:29.039
Quick, take
another picture.

13:29.107 --> 13:30.040
Okay.

13:30.108 --> 13:32.210
This time I want to get
a little more creative.

13:32.277 --> 13:33.977
You got a wind machine handy?

13:34.045 --> 13:34.978
Just shoot me.

13:35.046 --> 13:36.047
Okay.

13:36.281 --> 13:37.514
Great.

13:37.582 --> 13:39.483
I'm going to have to take
the camera to the dance with me

13:39.551 --> 13:40.818
and keep having
my picture taken.

13:40.885 --> 13:42.486
Don't let anyone else
in the picture.

13:42.553 --> 13:45.555
If people aren't flickering out,
they'll gain a hundred pounds.

13:45.623 --> 13:49.359
And to think I used to complain
when I got a run in my stocking.

13:49.427 --> 13:53.464
I keep him in a
little glass jar,

13:53.531 --> 13:56.767
which I refer
to as "Oz."

13:56.835 --> 13:58.169
Uh-oh. Jailbreak.

13:58.236 --> 13:59.636
You lost him?
Oh, perfect.

13:59.705 --> 14:03.573
Thanks to your overreacting,
I get to spend my Friday night

14:03.641 --> 14:06.276
looking for a cockroach
with my sister.

14:06.344 --> 14:07.177
Oh, come on.

14:07.245 --> 14:08.445
This is stuff
that keeps us young.

14:08.513 --> 14:11.382
Ooh! I think I
see a dropping.

14:11.449 --> 14:13.617
You look terrific.
Do you think so?

14:13.685 --> 14:15.820
Because this is more
of a standing-up dress
than a sitting-down dress.

14:15.887 --> 14:17.121
I thought we'd be
standing up more.

14:17.188 --> 14:18.388
It's too bad your car
doesn't have a sunroof.

14:18.456 --> 14:20.857
You look terrific.

14:20.926 --> 14:23.127
So, what's up with the camera?

14:23.194 --> 14:24.294
Oh, you know, I wanted

14:24.363 --> 14:26.864
to preserve the memories
of our big night.

14:29.434 --> 14:31.002
Uh, did you drop
your left cuff link?

14:33.571 --> 14:34.538
What was that?

14:34.606 --> 14:37.074
Northern lights?

14:39.410 --> 14:41.579
(upbeat music playing)

14:47.319 --> 14:49.553
Sabrina, that dress
is fantastic.

14:49.621 --> 14:51.622
Really? You don't think it
makes me look too hippy?

14:51.689 --> 14:53.423
¶ ¶

14:56.995 --> 14:59.096
My eyes are acting weird.

14:59.163 --> 15:00.965
Oh, I saw something
about that on <i>20/20.</i>

15:01.032 --> 15:03.000
The best thing to do
is keep them closed.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.335
Hey, could you take my picture?

15:05.403 --> 15:07.104
Sure.

15:08.373 --> 15:10.141
Smile.
Oh, no! Harvey!

15:11.776 --> 15:14.111
Sorry, your eyes
always come out red.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.685
Oh! Got him.

15:21.753 --> 15:23.854
No, that's a real roach.

15:23.921 --> 15:27.625
(shrieks)

15:27.692 --> 15:28.592
Wait a minute.

15:28.660 --> 15:30.594
I know exactly
what we need.

15:32.430 --> 15:33.430
HILDA:
A roach motel?

15:33.498 --> 15:35.332
Zelda, this guy is
a captain of industry.

15:35.399 --> 15:37.167
There's no way
he'd stay at a motel.

15:37.235 --> 15:39.270
Okay, fine.

15:42.273 --> 15:43.640
The roach Carlton.

15:43.708 --> 15:46.276
Nice. Except for the faint
smell of boric acid,

15:46.344 --> 15:48.078
I'd give it four stars.

15:48.145 --> 15:50.314
Never seen a camera
like this before.

15:50.381 --> 15:52.083
Just push the
button, Avedon.

15:52.150 --> 15:53.116
Picture?!

15:53.184 --> 15:54.451
Mrs. Quick, no!

15:54.519 --> 15:56.553
Mrs. Quick, we've got
to get you out of here.

15:56.621 --> 15:58.255
Now don't get too upset, okay?

15:58.323 --> 16:00.523
There's got to be a
simple explanation.

16:00.591 --> 16:02.693
It's a bee sting,
isn't it?

16:02.761 --> 16:03.727
Okay.

16:03.795 --> 16:05.929
I thought I heard
buzzing earlier,

16:05.997 --> 16:08.331
but I attributed it
to my tinnitus.

16:08.399 --> 16:12.035
P.A. ANNOUNCER:
The next dance is
for our King and Queen nominees,

16:12.103 --> 16:14.805
and then it's time
for everyone to vote.

16:14.873 --> 16:15.939
Mrs. Quick,
don't panic, okay?

16:16.007 --> 16:17.174
We're going to rush
you to the hospital.

16:17.241 --> 16:18.441
The doctors are going
to take care of you.

16:18.509 --> 16:19.610
Everything will be fine.

16:19.678 --> 16:21.045
I just need one minute.

16:23.047 --> 16:24.415
Got him.

16:24.482 --> 16:25.582
I knew he couldn't resist

16:25.650 --> 16:27.517
that thumbnail-
sized Toblerone.

16:27.519 --> 16:28.519
Thank goodness.

16:28.587 --> 16:30.287
Zap him back
so we can go home.

16:30.355 --> 16:31.454
Right.

16:31.522 --> 16:33.456
But first a little
good-natured torture.

16:33.524 --> 16:34.458
Hilda.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.762
Where am I?

16:38.829 --> 16:42.266
Um... we found you

16:42.333 --> 16:43.734
wandering out
in the street.

16:43.802 --> 16:45.869
I-I think you may have
hit your head.

16:45.937 --> 16:47.271
Do you feel all right?

16:47.339 --> 16:48.672
Do you perhaps feel like

16:48.740 --> 16:51.041
you now understand what it's
like to be the little guy

16:51.109 --> 16:53.777
in constant fear of
unfeeling giants?

16:53.844 --> 16:55.111
No.

16:55.179 --> 16:58.282
I feel strong.

16:58.349 --> 17:00.017
In fact,

17:00.085 --> 17:02.486
I feel like I could withstand
a nuclear holocaust.

17:04.321 --> 17:05.356
I suppose this means

17:05.356 --> 17:07.156
you're going to go
ahead and build

17:07.224 --> 17:08.758
your Everything
Emporium now.

17:08.826 --> 17:09.859
What?

17:09.928 --> 17:11.795
I'm going to climb
Mount Everest.

17:11.863 --> 17:13.797
Bike across Death Valley.

17:13.865 --> 17:17.000
I'm going to eat
my weight in garbage.

17:17.068 --> 17:20.037
Why would I want to waste my
indestructableness on business?

17:20.105 --> 17:23.506
See? I told you
overreacting would work.

17:23.574 --> 17:24.741
Harvey, stop fidgeting.

17:24.843 --> 17:27.044
Try and look like we're
having a good time.

17:27.111 --> 17:29.646
I feel like all we're being
judged on is how we look.

17:29.714 --> 17:30.781
How do I look?

17:30.849 --> 17:32.116
Gorgeous.

17:32.183 --> 17:33.583
Now will you stop
asking me that?

17:33.651 --> 17:34.685
Stop yelling at me.

17:34.753 --> 17:35.986
Nobody's going
to vote for us

17:36.053 --> 17:37.721
if it looks
like we're fighting.

17:37.788 --> 17:39.657
But do I really
look okay?

17:39.691 --> 17:41.725
Okay, I'm sorry.
Let's just dance.

17:42.827 --> 17:45.095
Got to go.

17:47.865 --> 17:50.334
Dreama, have you
seen my camera?

17:50.401 --> 17:52.469
No, but you can use mine.

17:52.537 --> 17:54.038
Look for it, please.

17:54.105 --> 17:57.540
Something tells me this is
about more than a camera.

17:57.608 --> 18:00.110
Thank you for helping
me back here.

18:00.178 --> 18:01.245
My pleasure.

18:01.312 --> 18:03.981
I was feeling
a little disoriented.

18:04.082 --> 18:08.018
Ooh, I wonder if I could
scurry up those curtains.

18:08.086 --> 18:10.054
Come on, Hilda, let's go.

18:10.121 --> 18:13.323
Call the elevator.
I'll be right there.

18:21.299 --> 18:23.400
(chuckling)

18:23.468 --> 18:27.103
I'm beginning to think
you have a problem.

18:27.171 --> 18:30.107
And now, the moment
everyone's been waiting for.

18:30.174 --> 18:34.811
The King and Queen of this
year's Snowflake Ball are...

18:34.879 --> 18:37.348
Harvey Kinkle
and Sabrina Spellman!

18:37.415 --> 18:38.682
(cheering)

18:38.750 --> 18:39.816
Sabrina?

18:39.884 --> 18:42.519
I thought dancing alone
was embarrassing.

18:42.587 --> 18:44.855
I can't believe
she's missing this.

18:47.625 --> 18:50.294
Hello, um, I'm really grateful
for the honor and all,

18:50.362 --> 18:52.229
but since Sabrina's disappeared,

18:52.297 --> 18:54.864
maybe you guys should pick
somebody else.

18:54.932 --> 18:57.567
SABRINA:
No!

18:57.635 --> 18:58.902
Sabrina?

18:58.969 --> 19:00.537
Ow, my foot!
Sorry.

19:00.605 --> 19:02.206
Dreama, do me a favor.

19:02.273 --> 19:03.607
Go onstage and
stall them

19:03.674 --> 19:05.409
until I can find the
camera, would you?

19:05.476 --> 19:06.710
Okay, but only because

19:06.778 --> 19:09.279
people are starting to think
I'm talking to myself.

19:09.347 --> 19:12.049
SABRINA:
<i>Here I am in my moment of glory</i>
<i>and no one can see me.</i>

19:12.116 --> 19:13.984
<i>Too bad I'm not a bigger fan</i>
<i>of irony.</i>

19:14.052 --> 19:16.519
She's really levelheaded
and pretty down to earth.

19:16.587 --> 19:18.455
<i>Is that girl talking about me?</i>

19:18.523 --> 19:20.056
Yeah, I voted for Sabrina, too.

19:20.124 --> 19:21.358
I mean, she's nice

19:21.426 --> 19:23.493
and she definitely doesn't
follow the pack.

19:23.561 --> 19:25.695
<i>Oh, great, I dieted</i>
<i>until I became invisible</i>

19:25.763 --> 19:27.530
<i>and spent a load of money</i>
<i>on a dress</i>

19:27.598 --> 19:30.467
<i>and they voted for me because</i>
<i>I don't normally do that.</i>

19:30.534 --> 19:32.803
I'm back.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.939
All I needed to restore myself
was a little self-esteem.

19:36.007 --> 19:37.941
And I definitely
don't need to diet.

19:38.009 --> 19:39.610
In fact,
if I don't eat something,

19:39.678 --> 19:40.944
I'm going to keel over.

19:41.012 --> 19:42.212
Mrs. Quick!

19:42.280 --> 19:43.547
Sorry about your dress.

19:43.615 --> 19:44.782
Oh, that's okay.

19:44.849 --> 19:47.117
If you don't mind, I
think I'll keep this

19:47.118 --> 19:49.119
for the next
time I swell up.

19:49.186 --> 19:50.687
It happens fairly often.

19:50.755 --> 19:52.156
Well, the good news is,
we didn't have to go

19:52.223 --> 19:53.624
to the emergency room.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.058
Yeah, I suppose
you're right.

19:55.126 --> 19:56.827
Although part of me
was looking forward

19:56.895 --> 19:58.228
to all of the excitement.

19:58.296 --> 20:01.131
And now my personal favorite,
Mr. Bunny Rabbit.

20:03.000 --> 20:03.566
(crowd groans)

20:03.634 --> 20:04.935
Hey, where have you been?

20:05.003 --> 20:06.903
Awash in social
pressure, but I'm back,

20:06.972 --> 20:08.939
and I've got something
I'm going to say.

20:09.007 --> 20:10.307
Well, don't tell the story

20:10.375 --> 20:12.376
about the two priests
on the golf course,

20:12.443 --> 20:14.010
'cause Dreama
already did that.

20:14.078 --> 20:15.078
It got a laugh.

20:16.948 --> 20:18.248
I just want to say

20:18.315 --> 20:20.150
that I've learned
an important lesson tonight.

20:20.217 --> 20:22.152
I realized that what a person
looks like on the outside

20:22.220 --> 20:23.287
doesn't matter half as much

20:23.354 --> 20:24.621
as what she's like
on the inside.

20:24.689 --> 20:27.491
I think this belongs to Sabrina.

20:27.558 --> 20:28.892
Or Allan Carr.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.160
Don't get me wrong.

20:30.228 --> 20:32.129
I'm all for hygiene
and grooming, but thanks to you,

20:32.197 --> 20:33.864
I'll be keeping it
all in perspective.

20:33.932 --> 20:37.234
QUICK:
This is a moment
she'll never want to forget.

20:37.301 --> 20:39.135
Say cheese.

20:39.203 --> 20:40.637
Mrs. Quick, no!

20:44.042 --> 20:45.775
So there we were
receiving our crowns

20:45.877 --> 20:47.577
when suddenly
Sabrina ballooned out.

20:47.645 --> 20:48.612
She was huge.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.314
At this time,
we think a rogue bee

20:51.382 --> 20:54.485
may have been
the culprit.
Wow.

20:54.552 --> 20:57.587
I hope she wasn't
planning to wear
it to the prom.

20:57.655 --> 20:59.823
Well, I'm sure Sabrina
will be fine.

20:59.924 --> 21:01.291
Thanks for bringing her home.

21:01.358 --> 21:02.726
(crickets chirping)

21:02.793 --> 21:04.494
SABRINA:
Is the coast clear?

21:04.562 --> 21:06.163
Oh, I've learned
my lesson.

21:06.231 --> 21:08.531
I'm never starving myself again.

21:08.599 --> 21:10.167
Honey, just remember.

21:10.235 --> 21:12.569
It you just eat right
and get regular exercise,

21:12.637 --> 21:14.337
you'll never have a problem.

21:14.405 --> 21:17.240
SALEM:
Mm. It's always worked for me.

21:17.308 --> 21:19.443
Are there any more
apple delights?
