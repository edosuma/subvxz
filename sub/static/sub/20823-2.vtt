WEBVTT

00:05.190 --> 00:08.191
How can you not love The Beach?

00:08.193 --> 00:10.193
It's the best neighbourhood in the city.

00:10.195 --> 00:12.596
- Just ask anyone who lives here.
- I can't believe

00:12.598 --> 00:14.598
the irony of that is lost on you.

00:14.600 --> 00:17.467
I mean, look around. It's
like living in a small town.

00:17.469 --> 00:21.104
Beautiful scenery,
great schools, quaint cafés...

00:21.106 --> 00:23.240
Stroller convoys, yoga dress codes,

00:23.242 --> 00:25.709
tiny dogs and their nosy owners...

00:25.711 --> 00:27.878
Hey! Nosy's good. Nosy's safe.

00:27.880 --> 00:30.080
You know what else is safe? Locks.

00:30.082 --> 00:33.083
That we use in the rest of the
city to keep out nosy people.

00:33.085 --> 00:35.185
Speaking of nosy, what
was in that envelope

00:35.187 --> 00:37.254
your father left you?

00:38.449 --> 00:40.924
A key? That's it? No message?

00:40.926 --> 00:43.927
Nope. I figured out it's
for a safety deposit box.

00:43.929 --> 00:46.363
Why did your father
keep a safety deposit box

00:46.365 --> 00:48.932
- out here in The Beach?
- He didn't.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.337
We're here for a client.

00:52.471 --> 00:55.138
Woah, hold on, time out.
Your dad left you the key

00:55.140 --> 00:57.307
to a mystery safety deposit box,

00:57.309 --> 00:59.810
and you didn't hotfoot it
down to the mystery bank?

00:59.812 --> 01:02.345
- You chose work?
- Yeah, it's called

01:02.347 --> 01:05.015
selfcontrol. You develop
it when you reach adulthood.

01:05.016 --> 01:07.551
It's called avoidance, and
you develop it when you're

01:07.553 --> 01:09.553
- afraid of something.
- Thanks, Dr. Freud,

01:09.555 --> 01:12.222
- but case first, bank later.
- What do you think is in it?

01:12.224 --> 01:15.025
- Your guess is as good as mine.
- Uncut diamonds... Wait...

01:15.027 --> 01:17.494
Fake passports. No! A rare Pokémon.

01:17.496 --> 01:20.564
I was wrong; Your guess
is not as good as mine.

01:23.335 --> 01:27.014
This is it. Zoe Chow, apartment 44.

01:27.134 --> 01:29.406
And why does she need
private investigators?

01:30.808 --> 01:32.380
Don't you see...?

01:34.011 --> 01:35.344
"It"?

01:38.482 --> 01:41.017
The room has moved.

01:41.019 --> 01:43.620
W... not the entire
room, just the couch.

01:43.622 --> 01:46.389
It used to be... over here.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.160
Is this a... Feng Shui thing?

01:50.162 --> 01:52.705
Because I'm Chinese? No.

01:52.825 --> 01:55.632
Here, I have a perfect
view of the beach.

01:55.634 --> 01:57.467
A foot over this way,

01:57.469 --> 01:59.649
and I don't have a
perfect view of the beach.

02:01.339 --> 02:03.817
So you think someone broke
into your apartment and...

02:05.341 --> 02:08.044
- moved your couch.
- It's not just my couch.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.507
Someone touched my Inuit
soapstone carving,

02:10.627 --> 02:13.802
and Popo Chow's bunny
salt and pepper shakers

02:13.922 --> 02:15.979
more than once.

02:16.099 --> 02:17.455
And...

02:17.575 --> 02:19.956
When does it happen, this... touching?

02:19.958 --> 02:22.025
- Always while I'm at work.
- Does anyone else

02:22.027 --> 02:24.694
have access to your
apartment? Ex, relative,

02:24.696 --> 02:27.264
- former tenant...
- My ex moved to Dubai.

02:27.266 --> 02:30.300
I was hoping for further.
I've lived here with my popo

02:30.302 --> 02:33.370
until she died. And she was
living here 25 years before that

02:33.372 --> 02:36.106
and never gave out her key.

02:36.108 --> 02:39.910
- Also, I hear noises.
- What kind of noises?

02:39.912 --> 02:42.312
Squeaking. But only at night.

02:42.314 --> 02:45.215
- Have you tried the police?
- They won't take me seriously.

02:45.217 --> 02:48.318
- Imagine that!
- There was also the rat thing.

02:48.320 --> 02:51.178
I woke up one night and they were
crawling all over my living room.

02:51.298 --> 02:54.090
I ran out to call our building
manager, Tony Szyatowska...

02:54.092 --> 02:56.293
when I came back... they were all gone.

02:57.042 --> 02:59.129
Do you have any evidence?

02:59.131 --> 03:02.666
Found a dead one. He's in
the fridge. You wanna see it?

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:13.177 --> 03:17.981
I usually take my
rats on multigrain, but...

03:17.983 --> 03:20.250
That's not mine. I don't eat gluten.

03:20.252 --> 03:22.085
Someone must have switched it...

03:22.087 --> 03:24.254
I know how this looks.

03:24.256 --> 03:27.027
I'm telling the truth, I swear.

03:27.523 --> 03:29.228
You have to help me.

03:34.502 --> 03:35.799
Please.

03:35.801 --> 03:38.535
What was your building manager's name?

03:42.975 --> 03:45.775
- What the hell was that about?
- Not every case has to be

03:45.777 --> 03:47.510
- big and sexy.
- I'm good with small,

03:47.512 --> 03:49.646
I like small. I just don't like crazy.

03:49.648 --> 03:52.649
- Maybe she's not crazy.
- Are you kidding?

03:52.651 --> 03:55.652
That girl's got a oneway ticket
on the Wackytown Express.

03:55.654 --> 03:57.988
- Her ticket is punched.
- My dad and I used to get

03:57.990 --> 04:00.190
a case like this every once
in a while. Common sense

04:00.192 --> 04:02.192
says to walk away. But
your gut tells you

04:02.194 --> 04:04.761
- this person needs help.
- She needs help, alright.

04:04.763 --> 04:06.930
If there's nothing to
her story, we'll drop it.

04:06.932 --> 04:09.432
Until then, we can build
up the "Throw Matt Shade"

04:09.434 --> 04:11.699
"through the Window" fund.

04:15.339 --> 04:17.640
Bruce Everett, box 336.

04:17.642 --> 04:20.142
I'll leave you to it.

04:20.144 --> 04:23.313
Boy. I've been totally
avoiding this moment.

04:23.315 --> 04:25.849
Whatever it is, Everett,
I got your back.

04:29.687 --> 04:31.370
Whoa...

04:32.024 --> 04:34.357
That is so much better than a Pokémon.

05:11.786 --> 05:13.863
How the hell did your dad save up

05:13.865 --> 05:16.032
eighty grand on a P. I. Salary?

05:16.034 --> 05:17.967
He was always hiding
money so my mom wouldn't

05:17.969 --> 05:20.770
gamble it all away. Called
it his "bowling fund".

05:21.200 --> 05:23.293
Now I get why he was so bad at bowling.

05:23.413 --> 05:25.131
Still your dad must have loved

05:25.251 --> 05:27.544
you a lot to work that
hard. But eighty grand,

05:27.546 --> 05:30.013
that's a game changer for us.
We could redo the office,

05:30.015 --> 05:32.348
hire staff, maybe do a TV spot...

05:32.350 --> 05:34.717
Whoa there, Shark Tank.
This is a rainy day fund,

05:34.719 --> 05:37.587
not your personal slush account.
And why are you in such a hurry

05:37.589 --> 05:39.556
- to change everything?
- You have to spend money

05:39.558 --> 05:41.752
to make money. Tony?

05:42.961 --> 05:45.728
- You are...?
- Friends of Zoe Chow.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.730
Young...

05:47.732 --> 05:49.732
- black hair, a titch OCD?
- Yeah, that's her.

05:49.734 --> 05:51.801
She thinks someone's been
going into her apartment

05:51.803 --> 05:54.003
- while she's at work.
- Zoe thinks a lot of things.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.474
I'll look into it.

05:55.594 --> 05:57.760
Same way you looked
"into" her rat problem?

05:58.643 --> 06:00.610
- I run a clean building.
- Look,

06:00.612 --> 06:02.345
we're just trying to
help a friend. Is there

06:02.347 --> 06:04.114
anything you can tell us
that might ease her mind?

06:04.116 --> 06:06.652
My phone has been ringing
off the hook with her stories

06:06.772 --> 06:09.319
about crazy furniture and
stuff inside the walls.

06:09.321 --> 06:11.488
I'd be a little more sympathetic
if she paid her rent.

06:12.071 --> 06:14.818
- What do you mean?
- She didn't tell you? Figures.

06:14.938 --> 06:16.814
Her last cheque bounced. I called her

06:16.934 --> 06:19.095
about it and she said she got
dropped by her temp agency.

06:19.097 --> 06:21.965
I guess they got tired of her lies too.

06:28.652 --> 06:31.858
We talked to Tony, he said
your temp agency let you go.

06:31.978 --> 06:34.711
Yeah, technically I got laid
off. But it's temporary,

06:34.713 --> 06:37.313
and sleeprelated. Like I can't get any.

06:37.315 --> 06:39.315
What about our cheque?
Is it gonna bounce too?

06:39.317 --> 06:41.651
I forgot to move money
from my savings account.

06:41.653 --> 06:44.320
- I've been distracted.
- Because of the voices.

06:44.322 --> 06:46.381
Noises. Squeaking.

06:47.559 --> 06:49.692
You think I'm crazy, seeing things.

06:49.694 --> 06:53.180
I think there are people out
there better trained to help you.

06:54.238 --> 06:55.412
Check this out.

06:55.532 --> 06:58.557
That's Shona Clement behind
the counter, the owner.

07:00.347 --> 07:01.751
And...

07:01.871 --> 07:04.140
Here comes Nick.

07:04.142 --> 07:06.509
He owns the fruit stand next door.

07:06.629 --> 07:09.345
She's gonna offer him a
piece of coconut cream pie,

07:09.347 --> 07:12.388
he's gonna refuse
at first, then take it.

07:19.356 --> 07:23.059
That guy, Hector, who just
walked in? He's in apartment 51.

07:23.061 --> 07:25.250
Single dad, two daughters.

07:25.553 --> 07:27.263
His wife died a year ago,

07:27.265 --> 07:29.332
but he orders lunches
as if she's still alive.

07:32.270 --> 07:34.288
And over there?

07:34.408 --> 07:36.573
Mitzi. She steals creamers for her cat.

07:39.971 --> 07:42.961
- How do you do that?
- I'm compulsively observant.

07:43.081 --> 07:45.194
Most people don't even
notice the little things,

07:45.314 --> 07:46.973
but I file them away. Like

07:47.093 --> 07:48.853
when your favourite
couch moves eight inches.

07:48.930 --> 07:51.421
I didn't make that up. I'm
not makin' up the rats either.

07:51.423 --> 07:53.423
Did you say rats?

07:53.425 --> 07:55.959
I had that damn exterminator in

07:55.961 --> 07:57.719
a week ago, but they're back.

07:57.839 --> 08:00.563
- Do you have rats too?
- Cockroaches. But not

08:00.565 --> 08:02.154
the usual kind, these suckers are big.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.186
Hey, you guys talking
about the building?

08:04.306 --> 08:07.537
- Yeah! Rats or roaches?
- Neither. My pipes

08:07.539 --> 08:09.872
keep bursting, five times now. Thanks.

08:09.874 --> 08:12.242
These guys are private
investigators. They're gonna get

08:12.244 --> 08:14.444
- to the bottom of what's goin on.
- If you can fix my electrical

08:14.446 --> 08:16.779
issues, I'll shake a few bucks
out of the old piggy bank.

08:16.781 --> 08:18.948
- Me too.
- I'm in.

08:18.950 --> 08:21.618
Unless you'd prefer some
other form of payment.

08:27.291 --> 08:29.325
All right, I'll grant you,

08:29.327 --> 08:31.361
what's going on in that
building is a little strange,

08:31.363 --> 08:33.563
but Zoe did lie to us about her job.

08:33.565 --> 08:35.331
Would we have taken
the case if she hadn't?

08:35.332 --> 08:37.299
You tell me. You're the one who hates it

08:37.302 --> 08:39.068
when clients lie.
What's different this time?

08:43.774 --> 08:45.842
"This is so you can take the cases"

08:45.844 --> 08:47.844
"you want, not the cases you need."

08:48.258 --> 08:49.979
That's what the money's for?

08:50.099 --> 08:52.382
I guess my dad was
worried about how I'd keep

08:52.384 --> 08:55.400
the agency afloat once he was gone.

08:55.520 --> 08:56.652
I...

08:56.772 --> 08:58.901
I think this was his way
of taking care of me.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.992
- That's nice.
- I don't know

09:02.994 --> 09:05.228
if anything's happening to Zoe
or not, but it's clear she can't

09:05.230 --> 09:07.764
handle it alone. None of them can. So...

09:07.766 --> 09:09.774
This is one of the cases I want.

09:09.894 --> 09:11.215
OK.

09:11.335 --> 09:14.190
I'm with you, partner.
So what's the next step?

09:14.468 --> 09:16.139
Take a right up here.

09:16.141 --> 09:18.441
Let's go get some eyes
and ears in that place.

09:29.127 --> 09:31.154
Where's that seven?

09:31.679 --> 09:33.240
Where's that seven?

09:33.675 --> 09:34.825
No.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.794
Yeah...!

09:40.864 --> 09:43.399
Is there a carnival in town? Or...

09:43.401 --> 09:45.968
- Is this another career change?
- I'm trying to improve

09:45.970 --> 09:47.804
my memory, Dad. It's for a case.

09:50.198 --> 09:52.969
I guess the shortterm memory
gene skipped a generation.

09:53.089 --> 09:55.411
Now you're just showin' off.

09:55.413 --> 09:57.808
Well, it's nice to know
I'm still good for something.

09:57.928 --> 10:00.883
- What's that supposed to mean?
- My company.

10:00.885 --> 10:04.045
- They made me a retirement offer.
- That's great news!

10:04.165 --> 10:06.656
- What's great about it?
- Well, now you can finally

10:06.658 --> 10:08.658
kick back! Relax!

10:08.660 --> 10:10.660
A guy your age, you
shouldn't have to work so hard.

10:10.662 --> 10:13.096
- A guy my age?
- Dad, all I'm saying is

10:13.098 --> 10:15.164
maybe it's time to hang up
your blades, let someone else

10:15.166 --> 10:17.333
- carry the load.
- So now I'm obsolete.

10:17.335 --> 10:19.702
I didn't say that. You're lucky.

10:19.704 --> 10:21.738
Now you get to find your second act.

10:21.740 --> 10:24.073
Thanks for the pep talk, son.

10:24.075 --> 10:26.109
You know, it's amazing you
didn't go into coaching

10:26.111 --> 10:28.371
after your hockey career ended.

10:38.948 --> 10:42.358
You called your dad obsolete?
That's son of the year material.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.293
All I said was he
should consider the offer.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.692
- He might enjoy the change.
- Maybe he's happy with things

10:46.812 --> 10:49.692
- the way they are.
- You got anything yet?

10:49.812 --> 10:51.894
Nah. I'm only a few hours in.

10:52.461 --> 10:55.471
You really think this spy cam
idea is gonna yield anything?

10:55.473 --> 10:58.374
At least if someone's screwing
with her apartment, we'll have proof.

10:58.376 --> 11:00.643
What if it's the ghost of Grandma Chow?

11:00.645 --> 11:02.189
Wait, what's that?

11:02.818 --> 11:04.658
- I don't see anything.
- Not see, hear.

11:06.684 --> 11:09.485
Squeaking.

11:20.063 --> 11:22.765
That was the last one. We
checked all the apartments

11:22.767 --> 11:25.201
that share a wall with
yours, Zoe. No squeaking.

11:25.203 --> 11:27.470
You said you heard it.

11:27.472 --> 11:30.540
- Maybe it was just old pipes.
- Or ductwork.

11:30.542 --> 11:32.475
- Is there a basement in this place?
- No.

11:32.477 --> 11:35.778
No. No way. You don't do
heights. I don't do basements.

11:35.780 --> 11:38.147
Says the tough guy who
played pro hockey for a living.

11:38.149 --> 11:41.517
In giant stadiums, with
hundredfoot high ceilings!

11:41.519 --> 11:44.454
We're in "The Beach". How
creepy could it possibly be?

11:46.434 --> 11:48.291
OK, it's pretty creepy down here.

11:48.293 --> 11:51.237
- Redrum...
- Stop that.

11:51.357 --> 11:54.997
Do you hear that?

11:54.999 --> 11:57.433
Sounds like it's coming from back there.

12:11.083 --> 12:13.067
What is that smell?

12:13.187 --> 12:14.617
Stay here.

12:29.621 --> 12:31.701
My God.

12:38.016 --> 12:40.333
Still think I'm making it up?

12:45.062 --> 12:47.848
Ooh! Are they on me? I
feel like they're still on me.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.716
- They were in cages.
- OK.

12:49.718 --> 12:51.969
Every one of your neighbours
has a different issue.

12:52.089 --> 12:54.191
Water, heat, electricity, incests...

12:54.192 --> 12:55.752
- And rats.
- Someone is running a creepy

12:55.753 --> 12:57.555
campaign against
everyone in the building.

12:57.567 --> 12:59.726
My money's on Tony. Lots
of complaints, no action.

12:59.728 --> 13:01.628
But what's his angle?

13:01.630 --> 13:04.064
Maybe he's blockbusting.
You know, trying to force

13:04.066 --> 13:06.066
the tenants out so he
can jack up the rent.

13:06.068 --> 13:07.968
- Why move my furniture?
- You're single, you live alone.

13:07.970 --> 13:11.037
He's... he's trying to freak
you out. First, the rats...

13:11.039 --> 13:12.639
And then with your fixation on detail.

13:12.641 --> 13:14.808
I like to think of it as a gift, but OK.

13:14.810 --> 13:16.710
It makes sense. The building
is rentcontrolled, he can't

13:16.712 --> 13:18.579
just evict tenants without just cause.

13:18.699 --> 13:21.071
- Let's go.
- This I like.

13:22.115 --> 13:23.555
If Tony's responsible,

13:23.675 --> 13:26.096
revenge is a dish
best served right now!

13:30.550 --> 13:33.043
OK, thank you, we'll get right on it.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.428
That was the city.

13:35.430 --> 13:38.198
We're sixty days past
due on our water bill.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.433
- How did that happen?
- I have no idea,

13:40.435 --> 13:42.769
I put the invoices on your desk...

13:42.771 --> 13:45.038
- Why, I didn't see them.
- That's not surprising.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.407
Hey, I have a very
specific filing system.

13:47.409 --> 13:49.409
What system is that? Gravity?

13:49.411 --> 13:51.678
Ha! At least I don't throw
out important documents.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.114
- That was one time!
- It was a year's worth

13:54.116 --> 13:55.633
of tax receipts.

13:56.485 --> 13:59.286
- You two disagree a lot.
- No, we don't.

13:59.288 --> 14:01.188
What's the best part about your job?

14:01.190 --> 14:03.256
- The stakeouts.
- The chase.

14:03.258 --> 14:05.759
When you talk to a guy like
Tony, who's the bad cop?

14:05.761 --> 14:07.794
- He is.
- She is.

14:07.796 --> 14:10.163
See what I mean? You're yin,

14:10.165 --> 14:12.766
he's yang. What you need is a buffer.

14:13.216 --> 14:16.156
- Got anyone in mind?
- We're not hiring.

14:20.608 --> 14:23.330
I'm so not the bad cop.

14:26.381 --> 14:28.293
OK, you're staying here.

14:28.413 --> 14:30.312
We don't know how Tony's
gonna react, so just text

14:30.336 --> 14:32.284
if you see anything suspicious.

14:32.695 --> 14:35.188
I told you she was the bad cop.

14:42.213 --> 14:43.863
I don't know what to tell you;

14:43.865 --> 14:46.032
I'm just a facilities manager.

14:46.034 --> 14:48.902
With a creepy hobby
involving rats and cockroaches.

14:48.904 --> 14:51.152
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

14:51.272 --> 14:53.440
Really? Because...

14:53.946 --> 14:55.518
We took photos.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.479
I hope your lawyer's on speed dial.

14:59.599 --> 15:00.713
It's...

15:00.833 --> 15:02.649
Not even my building. I don't own it.

15:02.651 --> 15:05.018
Then tell us who's trying
to get rid of the tenants.

15:05.020 --> 15:06.970
You help us, we'll help you.

15:08.434 --> 15:10.190
I may have something...

15:10.192 --> 15:12.325
Stay here, I'll be right back.

15:18.703 --> 15:21.167
- Well played.
- Is that the good cop talking?

15:21.169 --> 15:23.903
It's the only cop I do.
You know, this reminds me

15:23.905 --> 15:26.239
of the night the lights
went out in the Forum.

15:27.026 --> 15:29.242
- Game seven...
- It's a text from Zoe.

15:29.244 --> 15:30.874
"Tony has left the building".

15:30.994 --> 15:33.803
How did he know you were gonna
tell one of your hockey stories?

15:36.463 --> 15:38.604
I'll get the car, you go after him.

15:41.756 --> 15:44.090
Hey! Stop!

15:51.196 --> 15:53.433
- Left. Nononono, my left!
- We're going

15:53.435 --> 15:55.902
the same direction. How can your
left be different than mine?

15:55.904 --> 15:58.333
Confession. I'm not really
good under pressure.

15:59.164 --> 16:00.480
There he is!

16:17.925 --> 16:21.343
OK, go, go!

16:21.956 --> 16:24.030
Don't worry 'bout me!

16:26.134 --> 16:29.436
Aah... I got it.

16:35.946 --> 16:38.011
- Sonova...
- Should I tell him to move?

16:38.013 --> 16:39.720
No. Hold tight.

16:49.124 --> 16:52.258
- The keys are inside.
- I did say I wasn't good

16:52.260 --> 16:56.363
under pressure.

16:56.365 --> 16:58.164
OK.

16:58.166 --> 17:00.365
Run the plates by me again. You first.

17:02.457 --> 17:04.755
- That's all I got.
- You?

17:05.674 --> 17:07.339
The sun was in my eyes?

17:07.342 --> 17:09.209
Well, thank you for
wasting my valuable time.

17:09.211 --> 17:11.310
- What about the tenants?
- Not my problem.

17:11.313 --> 17:13.279
And Zoe? Our client needs help.

17:13.281 --> 17:16.116
The crazy girl from The Beach?
You know I have real cases here,

17:16.117 --> 17:19.352
right? They give me a real badge
and my gun shoots bullets?

17:22.530 --> 17:24.057
Hello. Who are you?

17:24.059 --> 17:26.960
Zoe Chow. Crazy girl from The Beach.

17:27.609 --> 17:29.796
I didn't mean...

17:29.798 --> 17:32.065
"Crazy" as a term is...

17:32.067 --> 17:34.570
is an antiquated pejorative
whose time has come...

17:34.690 --> 17:37.303
- You gonna run it?
- Yeah, the plates? Yeah,

17:37.305 --> 17:39.572
Absolutely, yeah. Just... you know,

17:39.574 --> 17:41.574
it's gonna take me
a bit of time, here...

17:41.576 --> 17:44.889
My job is pretty complicated;
Protecting and serving...

17:45.009 --> 17:46.655
But I tell you what, once I'm done,

17:46.775 --> 17:48.175
I can give you a call, if you leave

17:48.228 --> 17:49.983
me your number, or better yet, we could

17:50.103 --> 17:52.021
- meet up in person maybe?
- At the agency.

17:52.916 --> 17:54.988
- Detective, I have issues...
- I'm...

17:54.990 --> 17:57.724
- good with issues.
- I'm being stalked.

17:58.130 --> 18:00.994
- By who?
- I think he's a cop.

18:07.665 --> 18:09.286
- Smooth.
- Why didn't you tell me

18:09.406 --> 18:11.757
- she was within earshot?
- Thought you were professional.

18:11.877 --> 18:13.377
Did I not come across as professional?

18:13.401 --> 18:14.841
I thought I came across pretty good.

18:14.890 --> 18:17.177
Since when did running a
plate become "complicated"?

18:17.179 --> 18:19.679
OK, you know what? This
is not a drivethru service.

18:19.681 --> 18:22.197
You think you got a real
case, take it to city hall.

18:26.853 --> 18:28.946
We came to you because
of your reputation,

18:29.066 --> 18:30.486
- Ms. DiMuzio.
- As head of the planning

18:30.510 --> 18:32.768
commission, we thought you'd
be interested in hearing about

18:32.792 --> 18:34.511
- a case of blockbusting.
- I'm listening.

18:34.631 --> 18:36.231
We believe our client and her neighbours

18:36.319 --> 18:37.880
are being terrorized
out of their building.

18:37.904 --> 18:39.127
So, take it up with the
landlordtenant board.

18:39.134 --> 18:41.034
The tenants have tried that,
but as you know, the wheels

18:41.036 --> 18:43.277
of government can move
slower than a herd of turtles.

18:43.397 --> 18:44.938
- No offense.
- There aren't enough

18:44.940 --> 18:46.706
city inspectors to handle
all the complaints.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.108
Yes, the ones we do have
are working 100 files apiece.

18:49.110 --> 18:52.545
No inspectors, no citations
and no fines means no change.

18:52.547 --> 18:55.131
- Where is this building?
- It's in The Beach.

18:55.251 --> 18:57.171
One of the last underdeveloped
parts of the city.

18:57.285 --> 18:59.321
The building was sold a few months ago,

18:59.327 --> 19:00.720
but its current owner
is a numbered company

19:00.722 --> 19:02.589
in the Cayman Islands.
No other information.

19:02.591 --> 19:04.624
Well, if you can get the
tenants to swear out affidavits

19:04.626 --> 19:06.793
on the harassment, I can call
for a special investigations

19:06.795 --> 19:09.028
- unit and see who's behind it.
- That'll be easy

19:09.030 --> 19:11.164
- like Sunday morning.
- Well, you will need 80%

19:11.166 --> 19:13.399
of the building to sign
on. You get me that

19:13.401 --> 19:15.455
and I will set the wheels in motion, OK?

19:19.229 --> 19:20.960
We can save time by recording

19:21.080 --> 19:23.440
- the affidavits in person.
- We'll start with a no brainer.

19:25.679 --> 19:29.558
Mitzi. We need to talk about
your cockroach problem.

19:29.678 --> 19:32.051
I can't. I'm sorry.

19:32.053 --> 19:34.130
Wait, what's going on, Mitzi...?

19:34.250 --> 19:36.923
Boots and I are moving
back to Yellowknife.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.773
Another time, handsome.

19:48.836 --> 19:51.337
No, no, wait, sir! We...

19:54.475 --> 19:56.075
Please Hector, we just need a statement.

19:56.137 --> 19:58.344
I'm sorry, I can't. I
gotta think of my family.

19:58.346 --> 20:01.279
Did someone threaten you?
We can get the police involved.

20:01.835 --> 20:05.017
No puedo hablar
contigo. No hablo Ingles.

20:08.288 --> 20:09.895
What the hell just happened?

20:09.901 --> 20:12.597
That was so not easy
like Sunday morning.

20:20.188 --> 20:22.322
I don't get it. Those are my peeps!

20:22.324 --> 20:24.791
- Not a single affidavit.
- They were all too scared

20:24.793 --> 20:26.421
to say anything. Someone got to 'em.

20:26.541 --> 20:29.129
Sorry folks, power's
out again. Everything

20:29.131 --> 20:31.398
from the dishwasher to the
rice cooker is on the fritz.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.567
You said you've been
having electrical problems

20:33.569 --> 20:35.769
- for a couple of months...
- Yeah, the power's

20:35.771 --> 20:37.437
- more off than on.
- Would you swear out

20:37.439 --> 20:39.406
- an affidavit about that?
- In a heartbeat.

20:39.408 --> 20:42.042
Has anyone threatened you or
offered to buy out your lease?

20:42.044 --> 20:44.378
Yeah, honey. Tony tried
to close out the lease,

20:44.380 --> 20:46.947
but he didn't get past the front door.

20:46.949 --> 20:49.249
I may know someone

20:49.251 --> 20:51.551
who can uncross your
wires. My father, Don.

20:51.553 --> 20:54.354
- Can I pay him in stew?
- Won't have it any other way.

20:54.356 --> 20:57.057
- Alright!
- Even with affidavits from Zoe

20:57.059 --> 20:59.593
and Shona, two does not
eighty percent make.

21:02.125 --> 21:04.000
Hey Maz, what have you got?

21:04.399 --> 21:06.572
No, she's not with us.

21:07.347 --> 21:09.937
OK, so the plates match
up to a firm called.

21:09.939 --> 21:12.464
Rampart Security. I sent you the link.

21:17.883 --> 21:20.614
That's the lady from the SUV.

21:20.616 --> 21:23.328
What does a Random Security
company have to do with...

21:23.448 --> 21:25.251
Tony something or other?

21:26.897 --> 21:29.723
Hey, do have any buddies
who moonlight with Rampart?

21:29.725 --> 21:31.748
Maybe.

21:35.864 --> 21:37.225
Give me an hour.

21:40.835 --> 21:43.452
Oil execs, hedge fund managers,

21:43.572 --> 21:45.439
- investment bankers...
- Now why would any

21:45.441 --> 21:47.207
of these people need private security?

21:47.209 --> 21:49.009
Wait, here we go: Jack Sugar,

21:49.011 --> 21:51.011
millionaire property developer.

21:51.013 --> 21:53.747
This guy's too good to be
true: Humanitarian of the year

21:53.749 --> 21:56.006
and filthy rich captain of industry?

21:56.126 --> 21:58.518
Those must be the only
things he does well.

21:58.520 --> 22:01.154
- He does a tux pretty well.
- Yeah, but is he our guy?

22:01.156 --> 22:03.223
If it was him, why not just pay
off the tenants? Why start

22:03.225 --> 22:05.826
with rats and cockroaches,
and end with threats?

22:05.828 --> 22:07.908
I'm guessing he didn't get
rich by paying people off.

22:08.016 --> 22:10.485
Sugar's annual charity
gala is tonight. It's a...

22:10.605 --> 22:13.100
Fundraiser for the Historical Society...

22:13.102 --> 22:15.435
In the ballroom just below his office.

22:15.437 --> 22:17.337
How did you get into my computer?

22:17.339 --> 22:19.339
Your password's "password".

22:21.042 --> 22:22.825
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

22:22.945 --> 22:25.212
It's time to find Mr.
Sugar's sweet spot.

22:25.214 --> 22:27.080
It's not exactly what I was thinking.

22:27.082 --> 22:28.680
This is perfect.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.751
I can confront him about what
he's doing to my building and...

22:34.022 --> 22:36.445
No. No! You're not benching me!

22:36.565 --> 22:38.959
We need to fly under the radar
on this, and you said yourself

22:38.961 --> 22:41.795
you're not exactly
graceful under pressure.

22:41.797 --> 22:44.831
But... you can stay here if you want.

22:56.911 --> 22:59.980
Hey, Dad. Can you help
me with this? I'm all thumbs.

23:00.533 --> 23:02.816
- Sure.
- Thanks.

23:03.690 --> 23:07.054
I haven't done this for
you since your senior prom.

23:07.056 --> 23:09.156
Jules was always the expert.

23:09.158 --> 23:11.892
Yeah. I miss her too.

23:14.353 --> 23:16.663
Listen, Dad, about what I said...

23:16.665 --> 23:18.986
- Don't worry about it.
- No, Dad, if you want to keep

23:19.106 --> 23:21.030
working, that's exactly
what you should do.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.550
Speaking of which, you still
have your electrician's license?

23:23.587 --> 23:24.727
Sure.

23:24.847 --> 23:27.219
Remember The Red Bird Diner, on Queen.

23:27.339 --> 23:29.551
Yeah, I know it. Great chicken roti.

23:29.671 --> 23:32.112
She's been having some wiring
issues and I happened to mention

23:32.114 --> 23:34.281
that I knew the best
electrician in The Beaches

23:34.283 --> 23:36.283
who'd probably be happy
to work for his supper.

23:36.285 --> 23:37.572
Well.

23:37.959 --> 23:39.653
Let me think about it, son.

23:39.773 --> 23:40.874
Alright.

23:41.503 --> 23:42.556
There.

23:44.860 --> 23:47.360
Not bad!

23:47.362 --> 23:50.530
Aren't you gonna ask me where I'm going?

23:50.532 --> 23:52.833
Well, I know it's not
the Hall of Fame dinner.

23:52.835 --> 23:54.344
Wow!

23:54.464 --> 23:56.122
I'd say you're getting all gussied

23:56.242 --> 23:58.178
up for your P. I. Partner. Am I right?

23:59.208 --> 24:02.509
- It's for a case.
- Yeah. Of course it is.

24:21.696 --> 24:23.697
You clean up nicely, Mr. Shade.

24:23.699 --> 24:26.032
Well, right back at you, Ms. Everett.

24:26.034 --> 24:28.435
I see you put some of your
father's money to good use.

24:28.437 --> 24:31.238
A necessary business
expense. Did you get us in?

24:31.240 --> 24:33.607
- Not yet.
- Are you kidding?

24:33.609 --> 24:35.943
I left you in charge of one thing.

24:36.063 --> 24:38.400
How are we supposed to find
anything if we can't even get

24:38.520 --> 24:40.714
- in the door?
- Sorry for the delay,

24:40.716 --> 24:44.050
Mr. Shade. Come with me.
They're guests of Mr. Sugar.

24:44.052 --> 24:47.087
- He says to find him inside.
- Thank you.

24:47.089 --> 24:49.589
- You were saying?
- Well played.

24:49.591 --> 24:52.234
So this is how the one per
cent of the one per cent live.

24:52.354 --> 24:54.694
- So, what's the plan?
- We need to get into Sugar's office.

24:54.696 --> 24:57.497
Find evidence linking him to what's
happening in Zoe's building.

24:57.499 --> 24:59.793
Assuming you know where that
is, race you to the elevator.

24:59.913 --> 25:02.269
The building uses a double
redundant tap card system.

25:02.271 --> 25:04.174
Likely on all floors.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.854
Executive offices, definitely.

25:05.974 --> 25:08.842
So we're screwed. Well,
at least there's free pâté.

25:08.844 --> 25:10.844
Sugar's employees need
their cards on them

25:10.846 --> 25:13.780
in order to get around. I'm
betting he has his on him.

25:13.782 --> 25:16.082
You think you can get
close enough to steal it?

25:16.084 --> 25:18.285
I didn't pour myself into
this thing because it's comfy.

25:18.287 --> 25:20.382
Thought you did to impress me!

25:20.502 --> 25:23.490
Here. So we can communicate.

25:23.492 --> 25:26.693
- Another business expense?
- Top of the line.

25:26.695 --> 25:29.162
- Heads up.
- Matt Shade?

25:29.164 --> 25:32.098
Jack Sugar. I was thrilled
to hear you were coming out

25:32.100 --> 25:34.634
- tonight. I'm a huge fan.
- Glad to hear it.

25:34.636 --> 25:36.570
- So, who's your beautiful date?
- Allow me

25:36.572 --> 25:38.471
to introduce Darlene Pepler,

25:38.473 --> 25:41.241
heiress to the Pepler
pharmaceutical empire.

25:41.243 --> 25:43.543
Lovely to meet you... My goodness!

25:43.545 --> 25:46.246
I'm so sorry! These heels!
I don't get out much.

25:46.248 --> 25:49.549
I know how you feel. But all
work and no play makes...

25:49.551 --> 25:52.319
Jack a dull boy, which
I doubt very much he is.

25:52.321 --> 25:54.221
Matt, be a darling,

25:54.223 --> 25:55.989
and, fetch me some champagne?

25:55.991 --> 25:58.658
That would be my pleasure,
Darlene. Excuse me.

25:58.660 --> 26:00.560
Take care.

26:00.562 --> 26:03.029
- So, Darlene...
- Hi!

26:03.031 --> 26:05.565
That was amazing.

26:05.567 --> 26:08.001
Remind me to check for my wallet later.

26:18.542 --> 26:20.125
I wish I had more time, Ms. Pepler.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.549
I understand. You have
to thank your donors.

26:22.551 --> 26:24.044
Well, actually no, I just gotta go

26:24.164 --> 26:25.847
upstairs and make a ton of phone calls.

26:25.967 --> 26:27.889
No rest for the wicked.

26:28.009 --> 26:29.889
Wait! Um...

26:29.891 --> 26:32.359
Do me the courtesy of a dance?

26:34.762 --> 26:37.885
Well, I did overpay for
those dance lessons.

26:38.005 --> 26:39.613
You're on.

26:40.035 --> 26:42.269
I just bought you a few minutes, Shade.

26:44.339 --> 26:46.239
Is that a tango I hear, Everett?

27:01.694 --> 27:04.424
- You're a bit of a puzzle.
- What makes you say that?

27:04.426 --> 27:06.459
A fundraiser for the Historical Society

27:06.461 --> 27:08.828
thrown by the city's
largest condo developer.

27:08.830 --> 27:10.869
Which office was Sugar's again?

27:11.800 --> 27:13.800
Can you hear me?

27:16.488 --> 27:18.000
Angie, which way?

27:18.120 --> 27:20.189
I'm all for progress as
long as it doesn't come

27:20.309 --> 27:22.391
- at the expense of the city's history.
- Right.

27:22.511 --> 27:24.044
Right.

28:03.185 --> 28:05.552
That was invigorating. One more time?

28:05.554 --> 28:07.290
I'm done.

28:10.024 --> 28:12.926
Excuse me, Sir, someone was
seen getting into the elevator.

28:12.928 --> 28:15.105
I have to attend to something upstairs.

28:15.225 --> 28:17.567
- Of course.
- Thank you, Ms Pepler, enjoy the party.

28:17.687 --> 28:19.566
Shade. You gotta get out of there.

28:21.503 --> 28:23.591
Angie, you gotta give
me a couple of minutes.

28:29.029 --> 28:30.210
Ooh!

28:30.212 --> 28:31.751
Sorry.

28:31.871 --> 28:33.813
- Hey, Darlene!
- Hey! I'm just looking

28:33.815 --> 28:36.215
for the ladies room. It's on three,
right? Twelve? Seventeen?

28:36.312 --> 28:38.185
- Twentythree...
- Actually, just down the hall.

28:38.209 --> 28:40.387
Of course. My bad. And you're going

28:40.389 --> 28:42.701
- to thirtyeight? Thirtynine?
- Fortynine.

28:42.821 --> 28:44.758
Fortynine? Ooh,

28:44.760 --> 28:47.193
looks like you're taking
the scenic route.

28:49.865 --> 28:52.866
I'm God's gift to the people,
where would I hide...

28:52.868 --> 28:54.590
evidence of payoffs...

28:55.670 --> 28:59.339
Written complaints and
general "douchebaggery"?

29:28.136 --> 29:29.678
Bingo!

29:45.787 --> 29:47.787
I could have sworn I had my key card.

29:49.924 --> 29:51.925
Thank you.

30:04.705 --> 30:06.906
I don't remember leaving this here.

30:15.781 --> 30:17.559
What are you doing?

30:17.679 --> 30:19.919
Don't get mad. I was bored, so I...

30:19.921 --> 30:22.689
- Organized the office a little.
- You looked at our files?

30:22.691 --> 30:25.358
I didn't look, I just sorted. See?

30:25.360 --> 30:28.127
Alphabetical, grouped by year,
colourcoded by month,

30:28.129 --> 30:30.129
and tabbed for secondary followup.

30:30.131 --> 30:33.366
And here are the water
bills you were arguing about.

30:34.089 --> 30:35.917
We weren't arguing.

30:36.037 --> 30:38.009
They were tucked under the radiator.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.238
No judgment!

30:41.358 --> 30:42.809
Thank you, Zoe.

30:43.384 --> 30:44.878
I don't know what to say...

30:44.880 --> 30:47.981
- Tell me you found something.
- Yeah.

30:47.983 --> 30:50.383
Here...

30:52.869 --> 30:55.264
It's a demolition permit.

30:55.384 --> 30:57.790
- Sugar's gonna blow up my building?
- Yeah, looks that way

30:57.792 --> 30:59.792
except, here's the
thing: There's no date.

30:59.794 --> 31:02.462
Demolition permits are public
record once they're processed.

31:02.464 --> 31:04.631
But until there's a date on it...

31:04.633 --> 31:07.353
No one knows about it.
No one can protest it.

31:07.473 --> 31:09.702
You and Shona are the
only thing between Sugar

31:09.704 --> 31:12.246
and one of the last pieces of
prime real estate in The Beach.

31:12.366 --> 31:15.392
And once you're gone, he's
free and clear to build this...

31:15.512 --> 31:17.121
Sugar Tower.

31:17.241 --> 31:19.512
Twenty stories, beachfront view.

31:19.514 --> 31:22.649
Deep breath. It's still just a drawing.

31:22.651 --> 31:25.852
- He can't do this. Can he?
- Not if we can help it.

31:34.623 --> 31:36.590
- How did you get these?
- Let's just say it took

31:36.592 --> 31:39.260
some... fancy footwork.

31:39.687 --> 31:41.795
Is it enough to shut Jack Sugar down?

31:41.797 --> 31:44.932
Well, he does have a lot
of sway at City Hall...

31:45.397 --> 31:47.340
but these are pretty incriminating.

31:47.921 --> 31:51.071
I will make some calls.
I think between this

31:51.073 --> 31:53.340
and the two affidavits that you gave me,

31:53.342 --> 31:55.518
we should be able to get a stop order.

32:01.763 --> 32:04.485
You know, I never made it
down here with my dad.

32:05.126 --> 32:08.155
It would have been nice. He...
deserved some quiet moments.

32:08.157 --> 32:10.624
Well, look who's coming
around to life in The Beach.

32:11.334 --> 32:13.594
It has its charms.

32:13.596 --> 32:16.167
Actually, do you mind if I
walk the rest of the way?

32:16.287 --> 32:17.933
I wanna enjoy the village we saved.

32:18.053 --> 32:20.521
Yeah, sure. I'll meet you at the diner.

32:25.593 --> 32:28.401
You know, there's a quaint lil'
café filled with yoga moms

32:28.521 --> 32:30.344
right over there if you get thirsty.

32:30.346 --> 32:32.846
I'll stick to the boardwalk.

32:49.610 --> 32:52.212
- Here you go!
- Wow! Thank you!

32:52.332 --> 32:54.668
- I feel overpaid!
- I don't mind.

32:55.415 --> 32:58.100
Alright! You have done this before.

32:58.220 --> 33:00.407
Thirtyseven years on the job.

33:00.409 --> 33:02.698
- Mostly phone and cable.
- OK honey, you must be good

33:02.818 --> 33:04.670
'cause no one keeps a
job that long anymore.

33:04.790 --> 33:06.322
Yeah. Well my company

33:06.442 --> 33:08.741
just figured that out
and made me an offer.

33:09.061 --> 33:11.051
My son thinks I should take the package.

33:11.053 --> 33:13.364
- And what do you think?
- The truth is, I don't have

33:13.484 --> 33:16.000
a choice. They're putting
me out to pasture.

33:16.774 --> 33:18.692
But I lied to him.

33:19.423 --> 33:20.861
Pride, I guess.

33:20.863 --> 33:23.463
- I'd have done the same thing!
- Really?

33:23.465 --> 33:26.400
Yeah. I'll fight for this
place as long as it'll have me.

33:26.402 --> 33:27.857
Old ain't dead, honey.

33:28.474 --> 33:31.546
- Old. Ain't. Dead.
- Damn straight.

33:31.982 --> 33:33.761
I'm just getting my second wind.

33:33.881 --> 33:35.876
Yeah, I can see that.

33:39.898 --> 33:42.249
- Hey!
- Hey!

33:42.251 --> 33:44.291
You look like the cat
that ate the canary.

33:44.411 --> 33:46.587
The city on our side.
The wheels of justice

33:46.589 --> 33:48.722
- are starting to turn.
- That's great.

33:48.724 --> 33:50.691
Thank heavens for that.

33:51.077 --> 33:53.823
And for this young man fixing my wires.

33:58.900 --> 34:01.301
You made quite the impression, Dad.

34:01.789 --> 34:03.458
Old ain't dead, son.

34:04.486 --> 34:06.673
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.643
I have been on time for 3 years.

34:09.645 --> 34:11.824
And Popo Chow for 25 before that.

34:11.944 --> 34:13.947
I'm late one month, and they do this?

34:13.949 --> 34:16.538
Woah, slow down. What
are you talking about?

34:17.152 --> 34:19.485
- A Writ of Possession?
- Gives them the legal right

34:19.487 --> 34:22.255
- to kick me out of my apartment.
- Who gave you this?

34:23.591 --> 34:25.005
Dumb and dumber.

34:25.902 --> 34:27.875
- You're served.

34:30.098 --> 34:32.032
So, it's not just you.

34:32.034 --> 34:34.601
They're vacating the entire building.

34:46.355 --> 34:47.781
Ms. Pepler.

34:47.783 --> 34:49.850
Or should I say, Ms. Everett.

34:49.851 --> 34:53.320
Nothing like having a private
security company on retainer.

34:53.322 --> 34:55.554
Comes in handy.

34:55.556 --> 34:58.325
I understand what you're trying
to do. And I respect you for it.

34:58.327 --> 35:00.460
You're trying to work for
the little guy, right?

35:00.462 --> 35:02.362
But we're in your way.

35:02.364 --> 35:05.399
- You're in the way of progress.
- How is it progress

35:05.401 --> 35:07.868
to destroy someone's community?
Shona's diner has operated

35:07.870 --> 35:09.960
out of that building for 12 years.

35:10.080 --> 35:13.541
Zoe's grandmother was there for
28. Hector's kids play in the park

35:13.661 --> 35:15.742
- down the street.
- They were given choices.

35:15.744 --> 35:18.578
Terrorizing people into
leaving their homes doesn't seem

35:18.580 --> 35:20.580
like much of a choice to me.

35:20.582 --> 35:22.455
The Beach is changing, Miss Everett.

35:22.575 --> 35:24.404
It's growing to reflect the city.

35:24.524 --> 35:27.541
If I don't finish this job, someone
else will, you know that.

35:27.661 --> 35:28.738
Besides,

35:28.858 --> 35:31.558
- I'm not doing anything illegal.
- Then you won't mind that we've

35:31.560 --> 35:33.953
turned our evidence over to
the head of the Urban Planning.

35:34.073 --> 35:37.350
Commission? As the saying
goes: "You can't fight city hall."

35:37.470 --> 35:39.853
You don't have to if
they're on your side.

35:41.202 --> 35:43.658
You bribed her. DiMuzio.

35:44.130 --> 35:45.839
- It's just business.
- Word of what

35:45.841 --> 35:47.807
you're planning will get
out, and when it does...

35:47.927 --> 35:50.400
It'll be too late. Because
bulldozers are ready

35:50.406 --> 35:52.112
to go, the second this
building is vacant.

35:52.114 --> 35:54.448
The wheels move pretty
quickly when they're greased.

35:54.450 --> 35:57.284
That'll be your partner.

36:01.865 --> 36:04.047
It's good to meet you, Ms. Everett.

36:04.167 --> 36:06.693
I did enjoy our dance.

36:16.304 --> 36:18.305
Please. This couch can't be moved.

36:18.307 --> 36:20.540
It has to go back inside.

36:20.542 --> 36:22.606
- Come on!
- You got no right to do this.

36:22.726 --> 36:24.811
You can't just break into
people's apartments and take

36:24.813 --> 36:27.314
- their stuff out and put it on...
- Woah, easy, easy.

36:27.316 --> 36:29.983
- What's going on?
- Courtesy of Jack Sugar.

36:31.016 --> 36:33.553
- A Writ of Possession.
- We lost, Ang.

36:46.415 --> 36:48.922
I should have known Sugar
would have a city official

36:48.924 --> 36:50.824
- on the payroll.
- There's got to be something

36:50.944 --> 36:52.827
we can do. We can't just let him win.

36:52.947 --> 36:55.500
- We're not going to.
- Please tell me you're about

36:55.620 --> 36:57.164
to say, "This just got personal."

36:57.166 --> 36:59.433
Goliath picked on the wrong David.

36:59.435 --> 37:01.501
Yeah, that works, too.

37:01.503 --> 37:05.339
We got all of Shona's
stuff into storage.

37:05.341 --> 37:07.274
- Thanks, Dad.
- She's pretty upset.

37:07.276 --> 37:09.643
The irony is, her place is
better than ever. I just

37:09.645 --> 37:11.531
finished rewiring it.

37:11.651 --> 37:14.615
Apparently knob and tube didn't
go out with the Lindy Hop.

37:14.617 --> 37:17.184
- Knob and tube?
- Yeah, it's an old form

37:17.186 --> 37:19.253
of electrical wiring. The
porcelain tubes carry...

37:19.255 --> 37:21.521
Yeah, yeah, Dad, I know what it is.

37:21.523 --> 37:23.690
How old would you say Zoe's building is?

37:24.052 --> 37:25.903
Well, hard to say, but...

37:26.023 --> 37:29.196
the fixtures I found,
it's... circa 1900.

37:30.427 --> 37:32.432
We need to track down Jack Sugar.

37:36.938 --> 37:39.840
It's my pleasure to give
this year's Wolfson Gold Medal

37:39.842 --> 37:42.209
in acknowledgement of his
contribution to the preservation

37:42.211 --> 37:43.976
of our city's heritage...

37:44.096 --> 37:45.634
To Jack Sugar.

37:45.754 --> 37:48.815
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

37:49.444 --> 37:50.951
I'd like to take this opportunity

37:50.953 --> 37:54.321
to thank the Historical
Society for this great honour.

37:54.323 --> 37:56.746
An honour that would not have
been possible without the help

37:56.866 --> 37:59.693
- and support of Maxine DiMuzio...
- So true.

37:59.695 --> 38:02.129
How's that stop order coming, Maxine?

38:02.131 --> 38:04.998
Whatever this is, let's
just take it up tomorrow.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.826
Tomorrow's bad for me.

38:06.946 --> 38:09.236
That's the day your wrecking
ball is slated to demolish

38:09.238 --> 38:12.306
- a piece of our city's history.
- Is this true, Jack?

38:12.426 --> 38:13.563
"City's history"...

38:13.683 --> 38:15.709
Come on, it's just a cockroachinfested

38:15.711 --> 38:17.711
- eyesore in The Beach.
- That eyesore is home

38:17.713 --> 38:20.347
to some good people who got
kicked to the curb last night.

38:20.349 --> 38:22.950
- Legally.
- True! Sort of.

38:22.952 --> 38:25.719
The building Mr. Sugar plans
to tear down is actually

38:25.721 --> 38:28.488
- a heritage site.
- It turns out the designer

38:28.490 --> 38:30.791
of the famous Scarborough
Beach amusement park

38:30.793 --> 38:32.793
used to live above...

38:32.795 --> 38:34.761
The Red Bird Diner.

38:34.763 --> 38:37.030
You can't see it from the outside,

38:37.032 --> 38:40.200
but the wiring behind those walls?
Over a hundred years old.

38:40.789 --> 38:42.569
Jack...?

38:42.571 --> 38:45.713
I didn't know that it was a
piece of our city's heritage.

38:45.833 --> 38:48.075
Then why would you
have to bribe Ms. DiMuzio

38:48.077 --> 38:51.011
- to cover it up for you?
- Hey! That's not true!

38:51.013 --> 38:53.413
Perfect timing.

38:53.415 --> 38:55.885
Just so you didn't think Jack
Sugar was the only one getting

38:56.005 --> 38:58.771
- the royal treatment today.
- I bet if we went through your bag

38:58.891 --> 39:01.539
right now, we'd find a couple of
stacks of cash, right in between

39:01.659 --> 39:04.458
the pepper spray and the antigas
tablets, wouldn't we, Maxine?

39:04.460 --> 39:07.127
- Ahem! Ahem!
- I'm gonna take that throat

39:07.129 --> 39:09.396
clearing as a yes. Gentlemen,
if you wouldn't mind.

39:09.398 --> 39:11.665
This is ridiculous. These
charges will never stick.

39:11.667 --> 39:13.934
You're right. Bribery is hard to prove.

39:13.936 --> 39:16.470
- Extortion, on the other hand...
- So, we went back

39:16.472 --> 39:18.872
to the other tenants in Zoe's building

39:18.874 --> 39:21.942
and wouldn't you know,
they all came around.

39:21.944 --> 39:24.611
Turns out there's strength
in numbers after all.

39:24.613 --> 39:28.115
That has got to leave a bitter
taste in your mouth, Sugar?

39:28.117 --> 39:30.484
That's original.

39:30.486 --> 39:33.453
Let's go for a ride.

39:34.731 --> 39:36.590
Thanks, copper.

39:36.592 --> 39:38.458
It's no problem.

39:38.460 --> 39:41.189
Hey, you know, if you wanna get
a drink after I get off work, or...

39:41.309 --> 39:43.306
- Yeah, don't push it.
- OK.

39:57.167 --> 39:59.646
Hey, Matt! How'd it go?

39:59.648 --> 40:02.142
Well, Sugar and DiMuzio
have been arrested,

40:02.262 --> 40:04.785
and the building's residents
all get to stay in their homes.

40:04.787 --> 40:07.287
- That's great!
- I'd say it went pretty great.

40:07.289 --> 40:08.759
And it was all thanks to you.

40:08.879 --> 40:11.061
And here I thought you
were ready to hang it up.

40:11.181 --> 40:13.408
Yeah, about that...

40:14.251 --> 40:16.006
The offer my company made...

40:16.126 --> 40:17.700
You already told me about it, Dad..

40:17.820 --> 40:19.666
Yeah, I didn't tell you the whole story.

40:19.668 --> 40:21.159
It was more like...

40:21.679 --> 40:22.973
An ultimatum.

40:23.917 --> 40:25.138
Wow.

40:25.704 --> 40:27.140
You gonna fight it?

40:27.142 --> 40:30.110
Well actually, it might
not be that bad a thing.

40:30.112 --> 40:33.113
Your advice might have been a
bit harsh, but it was accurate.

40:33.784 --> 40:37.246
It made me realize that I
can choose my second act.

40:39.054 --> 40:41.188
Any idea what that might be?

40:41.790 --> 40:44.357
I'll get back to you.

41:05.203 --> 41:08.005
Feels good to save a village, Everett.

41:08.007 --> 41:10.540
It's a village worth saving.

41:14.441 --> 41:15.978
Have a seat, Zoe.

41:17.562 --> 41:19.970
If anything's moved at
the agency, it wasn't me.

41:20.550 --> 41:22.026
Some things were moved,

41:22.146 --> 41:24.064
but with... Angie's blessing.

41:24.460 --> 41:26.021
Like a desk...

41:26.141 --> 41:28.912
- And a chair with your name on it.
- I didn't touch...

41:30.098 --> 41:31.320
Wait,

41:31.440 --> 41:33.001
you mean a job? Like...

41:33.449 --> 41:35.166
Actual employment?

41:35.286 --> 41:37.268
Welcome to Everett
Investigations, Zoe Chow.

41:37.270 --> 41:40.204
You are officially the
buffer to our yin and yang.

41:40.206 --> 41:42.206
Turns out we need some
help around the office,

41:42.208 --> 41:44.388
so that we can take the
cases that we want,

41:44.508 --> 41:46.227
and not just the ones that we need.

41:46.347 --> 41:48.279
Can I have your attention please?

41:48.281 --> 41:50.848
I just want to say, thanks
to Everett Investigations,

41:50.850 --> 41:53.551
our lovely old building
has a new lease on life.

42:22.298 --> 42:24.649
You know, we used to
bring Jules here when

42:24.651 --> 42:26.951
- she was a toddler.
- You really love it down here,

42:26.953 --> 42:29.153
- don't you?
- No place I'd rather live.

42:31.690 --> 42:33.991
You know, I have to admit,
I'm beginning to see why.

42:33.993 --> 42:37.195
Wow. City girl changing her tune?

42:39.098 --> 42:41.899
I was going to read you
the rest of my dad's note,

42:41.901 --> 42:44.268
- but now...
- Eheheh...

42:45.645 --> 42:47.271
"I know you'll resist it,"

42:47.273 --> 42:50.007
"but one day you'll find
the perfect partner."

42:50.665 --> 42:52.359
"And every day will seem"

42:52.479 --> 42:54.078
"like a new and exciting adventure."

42:56.682 --> 42:58.950
You know he wasn't
talking about you, Shade.

42:58.952 --> 43:01.823
Everett face it, your dad

43:01.943 --> 43:04.489
was the smartest man I never knew.
