18:55.591 --> 18:56.757
It was fun.

18:56.759 --> 18:58.759
- Wow.
- Yep.

18:58.761 --> 19:00.260
Good job.

19:00.262 --> 19:02.596
Thanks for, uh, keeping an eye on her.

19:02.598 --> 19:05.599
It was easy. She's a great kid.

19:05.601 --> 19:07.601
Yeah, she is.

19:07.603 --> 19:09.269
[Gunshots]

19:09.271 --> 19:10.437
[Groans]

19:10.439 --> 19:13.156
Jonah taught me how to use a maxi pad.

19:13.158 --> 19:16.193
[Groans]

19:17.830 --> 19:20.831
Thank you all for gathering to help me.

19:20.833 --> 19:23.867
Honor and remember...

19:24.953 --> 19:26.953
Charles Maynard Rand.

19:26.955 --> 19:29.706
Why do we have to destroy the couch?

19:29.708 --> 19:32.292
Well, for one thing,
it's a wonderful way.

19:32.294 --> 19:34.344
To memorialize a man.

19:34.346 --> 19:36.129
Plus, I looked up the store policy.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.348
If a death occurs on
any display furniture,

19:38.350 --> 19:39.466
it has to be destroyed.

19:39.468 --> 19:41.134
- Who knew?
- I knew.

19:41.136 --> 19:44.137
Same thing happened at the
Kirkwood store a few months ago.

19:45.474 --> 19:47.691
- Jonah?
- Right.

19:54.483 --> 19:57.984
We didn't know Charles,
but he chose to spend.

19:57.986 --> 20:02.155
The last few moments of his life with us.

20:02.157 --> 20:06.743
Charles, may your soul...

20:06.745 --> 20:10.497
Or non-denominational life force, I guess,

20:10.499 --> 20:14.835
be lifted by the non-gender-specific.

20:14.837 --> 20:20.841
Arms of a loving entity or non-entity...

20:20.843 --> 20:23.677
Hey. Just once?

20:23.679 --> 20:25.345
Knock yourself out.

20:25.347 --> 20:27.013
Jesus Christ!

20:27.015 --> 20:32.352
The hands of Jesus Christ,
who saves us from our sins.

20:32.354 --> 20:35.071
With his precious blood, and
welcomes us as little lambs...

20:35.073 --> 20:38.575
Hey. Thanks for helping me out today.

20:38.577 --> 20:41.545
Yeah, I got your back.

20:43.498 --> 20:45.215
I know you brought your
daughter into work.

20:45.217 --> 20:47.000
I got to write you up. You get it.

20:47.002 --> 20:50.253
We give you the love,
and we take away the evil!

20:50.255 --> 20:52.756
Amen!

20:52.758 --> 20:55.675
[Exhales] What a day!

20:55.677 --> 20:57.594
How much gas you put on that thing?

20:57.596 --> 21:02.182
None, and that fabric is
supposed to be fire-retardant.

21:02.184 --> 21:03.850
- Okay, uh...
- Wow.

21:03.852 --> 21:06.603
God bless us all,
and let's get out of here.
