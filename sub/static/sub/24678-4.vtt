00:11.845 --> 00:14.485
- Assassin!
- Get away from me, you freak!

00:14.515 --> 00:17.621
- That's enough now.
- He was stealing money from the box.

00:17.651 --> 00:20.257
He's a thief. He steals their
blood, the blood of Christ!

00:20.287 --> 00:21.891
Take away the sins of the world!

00:21.922 --> 00:23.401
A thief! Shut up!

00:23.423 --> 00:25.596
- Stop it, both of you!
- Assassin! Assassin!

00:25.626 --> 00:27.833
Hey, what is going on here?

00:27.861 --> 00:30.273
This nutcase was trying to take
the money from the candle box.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.742
Kevin did it.

00:31.765 --> 00:35.178
- What'd I tell you about drinking
in the church?
- Morris, please.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.149
Who does this belong to?

00:44.845 --> 00:47.223
I want you both out of here, right now.

00:48.448 --> 00:51.520
- I'm not done cleaning up.
- You can finish later.

00:55.322 --> 00:57.233
It's that kid.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.502
Do you really not give a damn, Father?

01:02.996 --> 01:05.909
We can talk about this later, Morris.

01:05.933 --> 01:09.847
18, 19, 20, 21, 22.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.009
We need 30. The guy said 30.

01:13.006 --> 01:14.849
Come on.

01:18.345 --> 01:21.383
- We want the cash.
- Get outta here. You ain't got no gun.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.592
Please! Oh!

01:28.622 --> 01:31.000
Here.

01:31.024 --> 01:33.129
Grab the money!

01:33.160 --> 01:34.833
Here.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.366
Yo, Kevin, man. Come on, bro'.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:52.045 --> 01:54.047
- Man.
- Hey, man, what's up?

02:02.823 --> 02:05.064
Police! Don't move! Get down there!

02:05.092 --> 02:07.971
- Be cool, Chiggy. Don't say nothin'.
- You shut your mouth.

02:07.995 --> 02:10.475
- Put your hands behind your back.
- Stay down there.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.807
I ain't got that kind of cash.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.143
My pops find out, he's gonna kill me.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.478
How are we gonna get that kind of cash?

02:17.504 --> 02:19.484
Just chill, man.

02:19.506 --> 02:21.452
I told you, I got the bail covered.

02:22.342 --> 02:24.015
Yo, Mr. CO!

02:25.512 --> 02:28.755
Yo, man, you said I could get
that call like a half hour ago.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.989
What's up, Cinderella?
You late for the ball?

02:31.018 --> 02:33.328
Come on, man. Please?

02:40.627 --> 02:43.506
My man Chiggy ain't no Tombs virgin no more.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.032
Yo, man, I gots to eat.

02:45.065 --> 02:47.170
I told you I was gonna
take care of my boy, man.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.841
- Let's go to Mario's for a slice of something.
- I gotta take care of something.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.509
- What?
- Nothing. A thing.

02:52.539 --> 02:56.146
- You go to Mario's.
I'll check you later, all right?
- All right.

03:06.086 --> 03:08.498
Howard, is that you?

03:09.823 --> 03:12.599
What are you doin' here?

03:12.626 --> 03:15.129
Taking care of business.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.233
I know all about your business.

03:17.264 --> 03:18.971
Now you get on out of here.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.639
I don't like when you
talk to me like that, Morris.

03:21.668 --> 03:23.705
I don't care what you like or don't like.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.978
You're a good-for-nothing junkie.

03:26.006 --> 03:29.146
- I'm just one of God's children.
- You're a sickness.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.122
If you think this is gonna go on forever,

03:31.144 --> 03:32.817
you better think--

03:32.846 --> 03:36.555
No! Oh my God! Oh my God! Ahh!

04:26.333 --> 04:27.971
Good. Now...

04:28.001 --> 04:30.140
Back to the body. I just...

04:30.170 --> 04:34.209
Need a shot from directly above.
Like this.

04:34.241 --> 04:38.314
The doors are always locked
by 11:00 at the latest.

04:38.345 --> 04:41.656
- That was Mr. Abernathy's job?
- He was the sexton.

04:41.681 --> 04:44.161
Every night he emptied
the collection boxes,

04:44.184 --> 04:46.164
turned off the lights.

04:46.186 --> 04:47.893
He worked here 14 years.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.834
He emptied the collection boxes into what...

04:50.857 --> 04:53.838
- a bag?
- Gray velvet bag.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.568
It wasn't more than $100 a day.

04:56.596 --> 05:00.510
Father Capanna, St. Justin's has a
reputation as a haven for the homeless.

05:00.534 --> 05:03.105
Any problems with any of them?

05:03.136 --> 05:06.447
Morris had a run-in with one
of our regulars yesterday morning.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.645
What happened?

05:07.674 --> 05:11.417
This man Howard was caught
breaking into a collection box

05:11.444 --> 05:13.185
by one of the kids who work here.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.453
Howard's a little off,

05:14.481 --> 05:16.722
but I don't think he's capable of murder.

05:16.750 --> 05:20.926
- He does drink.
- I'll need Howard's full name
and a description.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.035
We've got a prior incident
between the victim and a juicehead.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.975
A juicehead fits. Gullet's missing.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.978
Probably the murder weapon.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.673
Over here...

05:35.702 --> 05:37.579
Something was removed.

05:37.604 --> 05:40.608
Abernathy had a bag of money
from the collection boxes.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.984
- These circles in the blood.
- Missing coins.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.319
What can you say about a
perp who takes the time

05:45.345 --> 05:47.723
to pick nickels and dimes
from a pool of blood?

05:49.583 --> 05:51.620
Yeah, Howard sleeps out here. So what?

05:51.651 --> 05:53.688
But that don't make him no killer.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.495
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

05:55.522 --> 05:58.002
They got the best butts
on 82nd Street, long ones.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.937
- Only one or two puffs off of them.
- Subway entrances.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.066
Especially the one at Columbus Circle.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.804
Mmm. You want?

06:07.667 --> 06:10.113
Nah, I didn't hear nothing.

06:10.136 --> 06:11.615
I got a box, you know.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.845
When I'm in there, I sleep like a baby.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.787
- Where's Howard's box?
- Doesn't have one.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.450
That's probably how come he's sick.

06:19.479 --> 06:21.959
Sometimes he has a cart, but no box.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.758
- Howard got sick?
- He's got a real had hack.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.855
But he's getting medicine for it.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.696
Saw him last night when I was bunking down.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.464
- I figured he wouldn't be around
here for a while.
- Why's that?

06:31.491 --> 06:33.437
When Howard gets into
one of his talky moods,

06:33.460 --> 06:35.770
sometimes he don't come
around here for a while.

06:35.795 --> 06:37.968
- Talky moods?
- Yes, he gets all talky.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.534
Yap-Yap-Yap-Yap.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.012
He won't shut up and he won't hold still.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.015
What's he say when he's in
one of these moods?

06:44.037 --> 06:46.950
I'll tell you the truth, sometimes
he don't make a lot of sense.

06:46.973 --> 06:49.510
All right, thanks for your help.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.681
Howard's being treated for TB.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.816
There's a clinic a few blocks from here.

06:57.217 --> 07:00.630
- I've been waiting all night.
Where the hell you been?
- I was with Lulu.

07:00.654 --> 07:03.828
- Damn, what the hell happened to you, man?!
- Shut up and get inside.

07:04.824 --> 07:07.634
You can't crash here.
My pops'll be back anytime.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.163
I don't need a place to crash.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.936
- Just get me some clothes.
- Man!

07:10.964 --> 07:13.774
It's nothing, man! I ran into some trouble.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.609
Get me some clothes!

07:21.975 --> 07:23.784
That's him in the blue coat.

07:27.047 --> 07:30.119
- It's a beginning...
- Hey, Howard.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.653
- We're the police.
- You wear the gold, you're the king.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.859
- I'm the king.
- We'd like to talk to you.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.561
Thief, that's mine!

07:36.589 --> 07:38.796
- Out of Palestine!
- Just admiring it.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.998
- Where'd you get it?
- Found it on the floor in Ecuador.

07:41.027 --> 07:43.303
And you sent the money to Italy.

07:43.330 --> 07:46.004
How about you come to our place?

07:46.032 --> 07:47.978
We'll get some coffee and donuts.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.140
Donuts? I like donuts a lot.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.939
So, man, give the dog a bone.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.317
They got a screwdriver to open up the box.

07:55.342 --> 07:56.980
- So the bag?
- Bag's mine, it's mine.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.819
- It's mine. Mine, mine.
- That's right!

07:58.845 --> 08:01.086
- How'd the blood get on it?
- What's going on?!

08:01.114 --> 08:03.253
Stop it, both of you. Howard, Howard, Howard.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.263
Morris the cat, he got all bloody.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.287
You had an argument with Morris!

08:07.320 --> 08:09.766
No, no. Kevin. It's Kevin. He steals.

08:09.789 --> 08:11.632
Who's Kevin?

08:12.625 --> 08:15.765
<i>♫ Beautiful dreamer ♫</i>

08:15.795 --> 08:17.900
<i>♫ Wake unto me ♫</i>

08:17.931 --> 08:21.242
<i>♫ Starlight and moonbeams ♫</i>

08:21.267 --> 08:23.042
<i>♫ Are waiting for thee. ♫</i>

08:23.069 --> 08:24.548
Bravo! Bravo!

08:24.571 --> 08:26.778
Great, the Goren Show's back in town.

08:26.806 --> 08:29.218
- Anybody Mirandize this guy?
- He waived.

08:30.477 --> 08:31.922
Oh, that'll hold up.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.582
Is, uh--

08:35.280 --> 08:37.591
- Is Kevin at the church?
- Oh, baby, baby.

08:37.616 --> 08:39.722
He takes everything. He turns it into powder.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.494
Kevin's a bloodsucking bat in the belfry.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.398
What about Kevin and Morris?

08:43.423 --> 08:46.097
Out of the east, they're sitting on a shed.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.231
The best of friends, they are.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.070
Sit down here.

08:56.002 --> 08:57.640
That’s it.

08:57.670 --> 09:01.140
That's all. Okay. I'll be right back.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.051
Help yourself to some donuts.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.422
- He's not our guy.
- Thought you found blood on him.

09:11.451 --> 09:14.125
Just his shoes. The killer
would've been drenched in it.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.259
So he changed his clothes.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.927
He's manic. He's too disorganized

09:17.957 --> 09:19.959
to have gotten rid of his
clothes or the weapon.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.997
He probably found Abernathy dead and
helped himself to the money.

09:23.029 --> 09:25.202
You don't mind, we'll hang onto him for now.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.608
We'll go find this Kevin.

09:26.633 --> 09:29.614
Besides the fact the Deputy Mayor
had his first communion there,

09:29.636 --> 09:31.775
I like what St. Justin's does
for the homeless.

09:31.805 --> 09:35.184
So let's do the fathers a solid
and clear this one quick.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.882
You were good talking with Howard.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.084
Mmm, lots of practice.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.621
You must mean Kevin Donovan.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.824
Works here part time like
a lot of the foster kids

09:46.853 --> 09:48.799
from the Little Shepherd Home do.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.302
Any beefs between him and Abernathy?

09:51.324 --> 09:53.463
Yeah, Morris was his supervisor.

09:53.493 --> 09:56.303
Kevin's a troubled kid
with a history of substance abuse.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.309
He's got a beef with just about everybody.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.368
- Coffee?
- No.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.937
He was the one who accused
Howard of stealing?

10:02.969 --> 10:06.246
- Yeah.
- Mr. Abernathy broke
up an argument between them.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.616
Yeah.

10:08.641 --> 10:11.247
We'll need the address of the foster home.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.655
He doesn't live there anymore.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.490
- He's too old for that.
- So where's he living now?

10:16.516 --> 10:17.995
Nowhere really.

10:18.017 --> 10:19.997
He doesn't have any family to speak of.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.999
Just kind of moves from friend to friend.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.659
When's he supposed to work again?

10:23.690 --> 10:27.763
He was supposed to be here this
morning. He didn't show up.

10:27.794 --> 10:31.173
Donovan's pedigree-- Possession,
possession, fare beat, possession,

10:31.197 --> 10:33.108
drunk in public, and most recently--

10:33.133 --> 10:35.010
you guessed it, possession... of meth.

10:35.034 --> 10:37.173
- Speed freak. That fit the MO?
- In spades.

10:37.203 --> 10:40.673
He and one Hector Rivera were arrested
for possession the day of the murder.

10:40.707 --> 10:43.347
- Made bail around midnight.
- Time enough to do the killing.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.185
He gave St. Justin's as his home address.

10:45.211 --> 10:47.691
And I ran the CO. Hector Rivera's an alias.

10:47.714 --> 10:49.352
The address he gave is bogus.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.123
There's a mug shot, but that's all.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.528
Bail was two grand.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.088
A lot of cake for a speed freak.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.929
Liaison this with the narco squad.

10:55.955 --> 10:57.400
See if they've heard of him.

10:57.423 --> 11:00.893
Check the last place Donovan was in
foster care. Maybe they know where he is.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.964
No, I'm sorry.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.466
But if he's 20, he aged out of
care a couple of years ago.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.479
I was working in the Bronx then.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.139
What about the other residents?

11:10.170 --> 11:12.480
Any of them live here
long enough to remember?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.143
Hector!

11:14.174 --> 11:16.313
Hector's one of our old-timers.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.652
He's been with us for three years.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.818
Hector, these detectives need your help.

11:21.848 --> 11:25.318
Do you remember a Kevin Donovan?

11:25.351 --> 11:27.490
Nope.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.659
Your name Hector? Hector Rivera?

11:29.689 --> 11:32.795
- So what?
- You know this guy?

11:36.863 --> 11:39.343
They don't have all day, Hector.

11:39.365 --> 11:42.676
That's Chiggy Rios. We were in
the same group home one time.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.911
- Where's he living now?
- He ain't in foster care no more.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.680
After his pops got off on parole,

11:47.707 --> 11:49.709
the judge let Chiggy go live with him.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.025
Take him off my hands. I'll be grateful.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.187
- What'd the bastard do now?
- Followed the family tradition.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.630
Hey, hey, come on, get up. Let's go.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.132
Come on, cops are here for you.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.658
- Come on, let's go. Get up.
- Oh, man.

12:04.691 --> 12:07.137
Let's make this short and sweet.
Where's Kevin Donovan?

12:07.160 --> 12:08.969
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.976
- I ain't gotta say jack to you.
- That's right, you don't, Hector.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.875
You're under arrest.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.317
Virtual Fantasy.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.085
You spend a lot of time at the arcade?

12:26.112 --> 12:29.719
You little jerk. Him and his punk
buddies be there all the time.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.367
Kevin Donovan?

12:48.368 --> 12:50.006
Just relax, kid!

12:50.036 --> 12:52.676
- I didn't do nothing, I was
just playing a game!
- We know.

12:52.705 --> 12:56.812
This is the part where you come down to
the station and talk to us. Let's go.

13:00.813 --> 13:04.124
You shouldn't have taken
a swing at my partner.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.130
I didn't know she was a cop.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.893
You're way too hot to be a cop.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.697
You're way too smart to think I'm going to
fall for that. Talk to us about Abernathy.

13:11.724 --> 13:15.467
I told you, I don't know anything
about who offed old Morris.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.806
Anyway, I was in lock-up that night.
Check your cop records.

13:18.831 --> 13:21.573
We did. You got out just after
midnight. Where'd you go?

13:21.601 --> 13:23.808
I was hanging out with my boy Chiggy.

13:23.836 --> 13:25.509
Mellowing out, eating a slice.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.041
Abernathy caught you stealing
from the candle box that morning.

13:28.074 --> 13:30.350
Not me. It was that freak Howard.

13:30.376 --> 13:33.823
He threatened to kill old Morris
right there, but I stopped him.

13:33.846 --> 13:35.689
I'll testify to that.

13:38.017 --> 13:39.496
Now can I be free?

13:39.519 --> 13:41.590
One last question. What
happened to your clothes?

13:41.621 --> 13:43.430
These are my clothes.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.163
They look a little small.

13:45.191 --> 13:47.068
I can't stop growing, okay?

13:51.864 --> 13:55.539
Hey, you can't just leave me in here.

13:55.568 --> 13:58.674
Dollars to donuts, his clothes
are ashes in an incinerator.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.082
What'd his buddy have to say?

14:00.106 --> 14:01.949
Same mellowing out, eating a slice story.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.817
We're holding him
for giving a phony ID.

14:03.843 --> 14:07.222
- You're not going to be able
to hold this thief.
- Robbery's not the motive.

14:07.246 --> 14:10.625
Anybody that can cough up 2,000 for bail
doesn't need to kill for pocket change.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.130
Something else was going on
between him and Abernathy.

14:13.152 --> 14:14.426
Could you find out, please?

14:14.454 --> 14:17.833
While you're cutting people loose, why
don't you spring that homeless guy?

14:20.493 --> 14:22.473
Do you know who killed my father?

14:22.495 --> 14:24.133
Not yet.

14:24.163 --> 14:26.200
That's why we need to search the apartment.

14:26.232 --> 14:29.304
Maybe if you tell me what you’re looking for

14:29.335 --> 14:32.805
Did your father ever mention
a Kevin Donovan,

14:32.839 --> 14:35.820
one of the young men
who worked at the church?

14:35.842 --> 14:37.844
No. Why?

14:39.579 --> 14:42.856
We think your father had a
relationship with this person.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.330
A relationship outside of work.

14:53.025 --> 14:56.370
I can't believe you're suggesting he was...

15:00.032 --> 15:03.104
Did this Kevin Donovan kill my father?

15:03.136 --> 15:06.379
We don't know. I'm sorry.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.880
- I know this is painful.
- Eames.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.634
Looks like Abernathy brought
his work home with him.

15:23.656 --> 15:27.001
These are photocopies
of St. Justin's account books.

15:29.295 --> 15:31.036
I keep finding places we missed.

15:31.063 --> 15:33.065
There's so much blood.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.511
Looks clean to me. So what do you want?

15:38.504 --> 15:40.177
What?

15:43.342 --> 15:45.344
Cops think I killed Abernathy.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.853
Is that what you think, too?

15:48.881 --> 15:50.986
I don't know what to think.

15:51.017 --> 15:53.657
Look at you. You're out of control.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.324
That scare you?

15:55.354 --> 15:57.493
You need to go into a drug rehab.

15:57.523 --> 15:59.366
There's a bed out at Apex in Brooklyn.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.736
- You come out there with me--
- Forget it, old man!

16:01.761 --> 16:03.240
You ain't stashing me no place!

16:03.262 --> 16:06.072
I'm trying to help you, Kevin.
You're sick, don't you get it?

16:06.098 --> 16:08.408
There's only one thing I want.

16:08.434 --> 16:11.472
And I got more than one place to get it.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.460
These look like they're
from the collections at the masses.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.960
- Abernathy kept the books?
- No, the fathers do.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.371
Mr. Abernathy did the collections.

16:36.395 --> 16:38.238
He passed the plate around?

16:38.264 --> 16:40.801
- Yes.
- How much cash?

16:40.833 --> 16:43.643
Well, it was about $5,000

16:43.669 --> 16:45.239
from the masses during the week,

16:45.271 --> 16:47.410
and $10,000 on Sundays.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.681
Who else has access to this money?

16:49.709 --> 16:52.315
The money is safely locked up in there

16:52.345 --> 16:54.484
until it's deposited every week.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.961
Only Mr. Abernathy and the
fathers have the combination.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.294
Can you think of any reason why Mr. Abernathy

17:00.319 --> 17:02.595
would have these photocopies in his home?

17:02.622 --> 17:05.125
No. He must've had a good reason.

17:05.156 --> 17:07.603
Suppose he was skimming
from the collection plate?

17:07.627 --> 17:10.233
Suppose Donovan found out
and was blackmailing Abernathy--

17:10.262 --> 17:12.742
explains why the kid had cash,
preferential treatment.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.972
Suppose the kid got greedy,
they had an argument,

17:15.001 --> 17:16.810
Abernathy got the dirt end of the stick.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.612
Suppose you had some evidence?
These don't prove anything.

17:19.638 --> 17:22.619
Suppose Abernathy was studying
bookkeeping in his spare time.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.953
Phone records from the Tombs. The night
Donovan and his buddy were arrested,

17:25.978 --> 17:28.515
somebody made a call from Central
Booking to St. Justin's.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.256
Two hours later, Donovan
and his buddy got bailed out.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.321
To whom at St. Justin's? Abernathy?

17:33.352 --> 17:35.195
The call was to the main switchboard.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.464
No record of who posted bail,
but Donovan's buddy probably knows.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.131
Step into him.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.798
I don't know who paid the bail,

17:42.828 --> 17:44.671
I don't know about no church thing,

17:44.697 --> 17:46.608
and I don't know about no murder.

17:46.632 --> 17:48.873
Kevin was chilling with me the whole night.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.812
Look, Chiggy, Kevin killed the old man.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.474
We know it and you know it.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.951
Maybe all you did was give him
clothes and an alibi,

17:54.974 --> 17:56.351
but we don't care.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.753
You're going down for it,
with or without Kevin.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.916
I don't see how that's going to happen.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.757
It's going to happen, all right.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.922
Even if we have to lie to make it happen.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.932
And you know us. We’re the NYPD.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.833
We lie all the time, and we're good at it.

18:10.856 --> 18:12.597
Before you can say "yo,"

18:12.625 --> 18:15.572
we'll have 10 witnesses swear on a stack

18:15.595 --> 18:18.007
that you killed Abernathy.

18:18.030 --> 18:20.408
We'll find blood on your clothes, DNA,

18:20.433 --> 18:21.969
fingerprints, footprints.

18:22.001 --> 18:25.210
You'll be the most thoroughly
convicted guy in Sing Sing.

18:27.807 --> 18:31.016
Of course, if you write
down what really happened,

18:31.043 --> 18:33.216
we won't have to lie.

18:44.490 --> 18:48.199
Kevin didn't say who put up
the bail, he just made a call.

18:49.495 --> 18:53.307
After, Kevin said he had to go to St.
Justin's to take care of a thing.

18:53.332 --> 18:55.642
He didn't say what.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.978
I went to eat at Mario's on 1st.

18:58.004 --> 19:01.110
I swear, I didn't know
he was going to kill nobody.

19:02.341 --> 19:04.787
Next day, he dropped on me
to borrow some clothes.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.053
His was all covered in blood.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.583
What did you do with the clothes?

19:11.784 --> 19:13.889
I shoved them down the incinerator.

19:16.255 --> 19:18.462
He didn't tell me he wasted nobody.

19:19.625 --> 19:22.071
Did Kevin tell you where he gets his money?

19:23.129 --> 19:25.666
No. He says God takes care of him.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.609
Gives him his jack, his apartment.

19:27.633 --> 19:30.978
- What apartment?
- Out in Queens.

19:31.971 --> 19:35.475
When he wants to impress the
chickies, he takes them out there.

19:38.644 --> 19:40.487
Open up. Police.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.635
Clean

20:11.177 --> 20:13.487
He's got a nice gash on his forehead.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.651
Took a header into the floor,

20:15.681 --> 20:17.854
then strangled from behind.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.688
You can see the thumb marks
on the back of his neck.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.634
He was rolled over postmortem.

20:24.657 --> 20:27.331
- That's interesting.
- I find this interesting.

20:27.359 --> 20:29.339
Left on the kitchen counter.

20:29.361 --> 20:32.342
Crisp new hundreds, fresh out of the can.

20:32.364 --> 20:36.005
Plus, meth, also left out in the open.

20:36.035 --> 20:39.175
No robbery, no break-in.
Donovan knew his killer.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.014
Strangulation.

20:46.045 --> 20:48.389
I got his wallet out of his back pocket.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.793
4-E's a sublet.

20:51.817 --> 20:53.592
Kevin's the grandson of the old lady

20:53.619 --> 20:55.360
who used to live there.

20:55.387 --> 20:57.526
Esther Covington.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.695
Gee, is there anything I should be doing?

20:59.725 --> 21:02.137
Yeah, once we're done,
we'll seal the place up.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.799
You just make sure nobody goes in.

21:03.829 --> 21:06.810
- Where's Mrs. Covington now?
- Sacred Heart Cemetery.

21:06.832 --> 21:09.369
- She kicked about a year ago.
- Kevin just moved in?

21:09.401 --> 21:11.540
His uncle called to make the arrangements,

21:11.570 --> 21:13.607
put down 3 months’ rent right up front.

21:13.639 --> 21:16.017
- The uncle's name?
- Don't know.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.611
He just said he was Esther's son.

21:17.643 --> 21:20.487
Did he write a check for the deposit?

21:20.513 --> 21:22.515
He gave the cash to Kevin, who gave it to me.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.755
Kevin always paid the rent in cash.

21:26.752 --> 21:29.323
I got to go to take care of this.

21:29.355 --> 21:33.326
After 18 years in foster care,
Kevin turns up an uncle.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.032
It's touching, isn't it?

21:37.363 --> 21:40.901
The cemetery told us St. Justin's
made the funeral arrangements.

21:40.933 --> 21:45.348
Mrs. Covington lived in this parish for
30 years before she moved to Queens.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.510
She wanted her funeral mass said here.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.180
Did you know Kevin Donovan
was living in her apartment?

21:50.209 --> 21:52.280
No. How did he come to live--

21:52.311 --> 21:54.791
Somebody from St. Justin's arranged it.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.988
Who? Morris Abernathy?

21:58.017 --> 22:00.190
Maybe.

22:00.219 --> 22:02.699
We suspect it was being paid for
with church funds.

22:04.056 --> 22:07.629
We'd like to have our accountants
examine your collection records.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.164
Our secretary said
you found copies of those records

22:11.197 --> 22:13.006
in Abernathy's apartment.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.943
A few pages.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.708
We need to see all of them.

22:18.504 --> 22:21.815
I greatly appreciate your bringing
this matter to my attention.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.718
We'll look into it.

22:23.742 --> 22:27.019
- We'll get back to you.
- We can get a subpoena, Father.

22:27.046 --> 22:30.584
That, my dear, is something you'll
have to take up with the Archdiocese.

22:30.616 --> 22:33.790
It's something we'll take up
with the District Attorney.

22:39.258 --> 22:43.035
And the internal audit
revealed several irregularities.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.507
There's embezzlement on a
significant scale going on here.

22:47.533 --> 22:49.911
Given Mr. Abernathy's
access to church monies,

22:49.935 --> 22:52.142
the implication is clear.

22:52.171 --> 22:56.176
- The sexton was stealing and
doctoring the books?
- That's what I'm saying.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.052
St. Justin's has dedicated
itself to helping the homeless.

22:59.078 --> 23:02.457
We cannot let a scandal derail that mission.

23:02.481 --> 23:07.328
- The Archdiocese is—
- The Archdiocese trusts us to set our
own house in order.

23:08.320 --> 23:12.291
Over time, through our own sacrifices,
restitution will be made.

23:14.493 --> 23:17.030
Now that Morris Abernathy is dead...

23:18.464 --> 23:20.637
The embezzlement will stop.

23:22.668 --> 23:25.148
In the last 18 months, Morris Abernathy

23:25.170 --> 23:29.312
has embezzled just over
$100,000 from St. Justin's.

23:29.341 --> 23:32.015
All of it came from collections at mass.

23:32.044 --> 23:34.923
Morris worked for St. Justin's
for over a decade.

23:34.947 --> 23:37.393
He was respected in the parish.

23:39.018 --> 23:42.761
- In deference to his family, I'd like to
keep this out—
- Sweep it under the rug?

23:42.788 --> 23:46.998
I understand your concerns, Father,
but we have an open murder case here.

23:47.026 --> 23:49.836
Captain, there's the embezzlement,
then there's the murder.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.809
Murders. Abernathy and Donovan.

23:52.831 --> 23:54.333
We believe they were both killed

23:54.366 --> 23:56.073
by an accomplice in the embezzlement.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.808
What accomplice?

23:57.836 --> 24:00.942
The embezzlement was Abernathy acting alone.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.816
Kevin Donovan was a speed freak.

24:02.841 --> 24:06.288
He killed Abernathy in a drug-induced rage.

24:06.312 --> 24:09.020
And everybody in this room
knows that his own death

24:09.048 --> 24:11.392
was probably drug related.

24:11.417 --> 24:14.091
Or do you just enjoy beating up
on the Catholic Church?

24:14.119 --> 24:17.100
Mr. Beckworth, there's the Catholic Church,

24:17.122 --> 24:19.329
and then there's St. Justin's.

24:19.358 --> 24:23.170
We have the utmost respect for the
Catholic Church and all its works.

24:23.195 --> 24:25.436
Thank you for your report.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.502
- We'll read it very carefully and
we'll be in touch.
- Thank you.

24:28.534 --> 24:30.138
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you.

24:34.340 --> 24:36.820
Well, that was pleasant.

24:36.842 --> 24:39.550
Tell me Kevin Donovan was not a dope kill.

24:39.578 --> 24:41.524
He was strangled. Not the
MO for a drug murder.

24:41.547 --> 24:44.027
The drugs and cash in his
apartment were left untouched.

24:44.049 --> 24:46.359
Any leads on his Dutch uncle?

24:46.385 --> 24:48.228
Whether it was Abernathy or somebody else,

24:48.253 --> 24:50.199
the trail ends at St. Justin's.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.567
What about you?

24:52.591 --> 24:55.231
Any dazzling insights you'd like to share?

24:56.462 --> 24:58.203
No.

25:00.966 --> 25:02.775
Well?

25:02.801 --> 25:05.281
I'm thinking about Kevin
Donovan lying on his back,

25:05.304 --> 25:07.306
staring up at the heavens.

25:08.807 --> 25:11.447
I sent you the autopsy report on Donovan.

25:11.477 --> 25:14.549
Now I need a chemical analysis
of the skin on his face and hands.

25:14.580 --> 25:17.060
Do I need to know why?

25:17.082 --> 25:19.187
I'd rather you keep an open mind.

25:23.822 --> 25:25.631
Thanks.

25:25.657 --> 25:27.967
"Liturgy of the Catholic Church."

25:27.993 --> 25:30.132
You thinking of converting?

25:30.162 --> 25:33.473
Because I think Father Capanna
would love to baptize you.

25:33.499 --> 25:36.480
Too late. You're speaking
to a lapsed altar boy.

25:36.502 --> 25:38.311
I should've known.

25:38.337 --> 25:40.578
The disregard for authority,

25:40.606 --> 25:43.485
the fascination with had behavior.

25:59.191 --> 26:01.000
Eames...

26:03.195 --> 26:05.937
I'm already working on a subpoena
for the financial records.

26:05.964 --> 26:07.534
Why do you need a search warrant?

26:07.566 --> 26:11.013
- For the priests' living quarters.
- What specifically?

26:11.036 --> 26:13.915
Letters and notes to and from Kevin Donovan.

26:13.939 --> 26:15.782
Anything with his name on it.

26:15.808 --> 26:18.448
And the probable cause for this warrant?

26:18.477 --> 26:22.619
Donovan had oleic and linoleic
acids on his forehead.

26:22.648 --> 26:25.128
- Olive oil.
- Scented with balsam.

26:25.150 --> 26:28.495
It's used in the Last Rites
of the Catholic Church.

26:29.655 --> 26:32.499
Kevin Donovan was given the Last Rites?

26:35.394 --> 26:38.000
By the priest who killed him.

26:42.534 --> 26:44.309
This is outrageous.

26:44.336 --> 26:47.146
This warrant is unconstitutionally broad.

26:47.172 --> 26:48.981
This is pure harassment.

26:49.007 --> 26:51.487
You have no idea how many
times a day we hear that.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.717
Now you're going to hear it
from the Archdiocese.

26:53.745 --> 26:54.951
Good. In the meantime,

26:54.980 --> 26:58.894
we have a very specific subpoena for
your collections records.

27:02.087 --> 27:03.828
Next to the Immaculate Conception,

27:03.856 --> 27:07.429
how the Church handles its money is one
of the great mysteries of the faith.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.938
You see these chits?

27:08.961 --> 27:11.373
The Sexton fills them out
after passing the plate around.

27:11.396 --> 27:13.603
It's the number of $10 bills, fives, so on.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.704
The chit and the money go into the
church safe until Sunday evening.

27:16.735 --> 27:19.909
Then one of the fathers recounts the
money, enters the total in the ledgers.

27:19.938 --> 27:23.249
After the sexton fills out the chits,
your embezzler fiddled with the tallies.

27:23.275 --> 27:24.879
Any suggestions who?

27:25.944 --> 27:28.618
It's not the Sexton's handwriting.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.888
And it'd be somebody
who had access to the safe.

27:30.916 --> 27:33.453
All the priests at St. Justin's
have the combination.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.294
How much money are we talking about?

27:35.320 --> 27:37.129
Around 10% of the collections.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.534
- That's $1,500 a week.
- Lot of small bills.

27:39.558 --> 27:43.563
Which turned into the new C-notes
in Kevin Donovan's coffee can.

27:43.595 --> 27:45.472
New bills.

27:48.033 --> 27:51.139
I've got a few customers that come
in every week to change money.

27:51.170 --> 27:54.640
Mostly waitresses. I can't imagine
any of them doing something wrong.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.677
- Are you sure?
- The serial numbers on the bills trace
back to this bank,

27:57.709 --> 28:01.418
to your window. This person was
changing about $1,500 a week?

28:01.446 --> 28:04.188
Sure, I know who you're talking about.

28:04.216 --> 28:07.527
- He's in here every Monday.
- Does he have an account?

28:07.553 --> 28:10.932
No. He says he owns a newsstand
over on Columbus.

28:10.956 --> 28:14.062
An older man. I haven't seen him
for a few weeks now.

28:14.092 --> 28:16.595
Could you identify him from a photo?

28:16.628 --> 28:18.699
Sure.

28:24.636 --> 28:26.946
Detective Bob. You got any smokes?

28:26.972 --> 28:29.111
I'm all out, Jimmy. Maybe next time.

28:29.141 --> 28:31.121
- Excuse us, fellas.
- Father...

28:31.143 --> 28:33.145
Would you mind stepping over here, please?

28:36.315 --> 28:38.295
We're putting you under arrest.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.990
Just relax your arms.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.494
- What are you arresting me for?
- The murder of Kevin Donovan.

28:44.523 --> 28:47.333
Hey, you cops, get your hands off him.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.469
Could you give us some room, please?

28:50.495 --> 28:52.975
- Come on, he's a good man.
- Everything's okay.

28:52.998 --> 28:54.477
Don't worry about me, people.

28:54.499 --> 28:56.501
I'll be back later.

28:58.704 --> 29:00.945
You're invoking your right to remain silent,

29:00.973 --> 29:04.079
and that's that, okay?

29:04.109 --> 29:06.783
I want to plead guilty and be done with it.

29:07.846 --> 29:10.087
All right, Father...

29:10.115 --> 29:12.220
Look, it's normal to feel that way,

29:12.251 --> 29:14.629
but it's just the stress talking.

29:15.687 --> 29:18.566
You're not pleading guilty.
You didn't do anything.

29:19.891 --> 29:21.564
I did.

29:21.593 --> 29:25.837
I killed Kevin, and I stole from the Church.

29:26.832 --> 29:28.470
I want it to be over with.

29:29.468 --> 29:31.175
You're serious.

29:32.471 --> 29:37.079
I gave Kevin money because he was my lover.

29:37.109 --> 29:40.113
I thought I could control him.

29:40.145 --> 29:43.615
After he killed Morris, I was afraid.

29:45.817 --> 29:48.229
- Afraid he'd kill you?
- Yeah.

29:50.489 --> 29:53.868
He was full of rage and taking drugs.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.703
I didn't know what else to do.

29:56.728 --> 30:00.198
- Had he ever hit you before?
- Yes.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.803
- Had he injured you?
- Yes.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.814
Why are you asking?

30:06.638 --> 30:08.982
My client has no statement to make to you.

30:09.007 --> 30:11.544
He wants to be returned
to his cell immediately.

30:15.380 --> 30:18.384
Top count's on the table.
Murder two, 25 to life.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.954
You can always dream, Mr. Carver.

30:23.188 --> 30:26.328
Notice of our intent
to present an affirmative defense

30:26.358 --> 30:28.099
based on a battered spouse theory.

30:28.126 --> 30:30.072
Battered spouse theory?

30:30.095 --> 30:34.168
My client was in the emergency room
eight times in the last two years.

30:34.199 --> 30:37.942
Hematomas, broken ribs, concussions.

30:37.969 --> 30:41.439
Serious escalating violence
at the hands of Kevin Donovan.

30:41.473 --> 30:44.511
I have statements from Donovan's neighbors.
They heard the beatings.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.853
My client feared for his life,

30:46.878 --> 30:49.381
and killing Donovan was the only way out.

30:49.414 --> 30:52.054
So you want to apply

30:52.084 --> 30:55.327
a battered wife syndrome to a gay couple?

30:55.354 --> 30:56.992
Well, on the facts,

30:57.022 --> 30:59.161
I'm entitled to an instruction to the jury.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.467
People v. Gautier. It's in Appendix C.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.473
I highlighted the good parts.

31:03.495 --> 31:06.635
Man two with recommendation
of 10 years’ probation,

31:06.665 --> 31:09.976
No jail. You let me know.

31:10.001 --> 31:11.503
You can know right now.

31:11.536 --> 31:14.983
It's still murder two, 25 to life.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.819
Winsley will be able to exclude Catholics

31:23.849 --> 31:25.590
and people who don't like gays.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.358
That'll leave me with a jury full of--

31:27.386 --> 31:29.889
Secular urbanites,
who will see a middle-aged man

31:29.921 --> 31:32.401
abused by his young,
murdering meth-head boyfriend.

31:32.424 --> 31:35.769
They'll see a man trying to pass himself
off as a battered wife. it's a joke.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.137
What's good for the goose...

31:37.162 --> 31:39.972
A battered wife is financially
dependent upon her husband,

31:39.998 --> 31:43.138
she's worried about her kids, she
doesn't have options. But a priest?

31:43.168 --> 31:46.581
Priests are sheltered. They don't have
experience in sexual relationships.

31:46.605 --> 31:49.085
- They're the perfect prey.
- Sounds like a hung jury.

31:49.107 --> 31:51.644
And McShale might be able
to get away with it...

31:51.676 --> 31:54.350
Unless I can add another murder
count to the indictment.

31:54.379 --> 31:55.653
Morris Abernathy.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.684
Give me enough to charge McShale
as an accomplice,

31:58.717 --> 32:01.163
and I'll make sure he goes to prison.

32:05.824 --> 32:09.931
I saw Mike talking
to Abernathy that afternoon.

32:09.961 --> 32:12.305
They didn't seem to be upset or angry.

32:12.330 --> 32:14.640
How about that night?
Did you see them together?

32:14.666 --> 32:17.806
No, Mike went out after dinner, about 8:00.

32:17.836 --> 32:19.975
I find all this very hard to believe.

32:20.005 --> 32:22.315
I've known Mike McShale for 10 years.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.980
Did you ever get the
impression he might be gay?

32:25.010 --> 32:28.321
No. But you never know, do you?

32:28.346 --> 32:30.826
How about unhappy with the priesthood?

32:30.849 --> 32:34.319
Well, he confided to a crisis
of faith 20 years ago.

32:34.352 --> 32:37.333
- Over what?
- He didn't tell me the details.

32:37.355 --> 32:40.666
It came up at a time I was
grappling with my demons.

32:40.692 --> 32:43.696
When Father McShale went out,
did he say where he was going?

32:43.728 --> 32:45.435
To visit a sick parishioner.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.205
Is that something he did often?

32:47.232 --> 32:49.508
He was on the road two, three hours a night.

32:49.534 --> 32:52.174
He-- he couldn't sit still.

32:52.204 --> 32:55.151
- If there is nothing else?
- Thank you, Father.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.522
Sick parishioners.

32:59.544 --> 33:03.253
Maybe Donovan wasn't the only
name on McShale's dance card.

33:03.281 --> 33:06.956
Visits to hospitals,
work at the soup kitchen,

33:06.985 --> 33:08.794
visits to nursing homes.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.595
I thought my social life needed help.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.602
Looking for guidance?

33:15.160 --> 33:18.437
McShale was. Here, in the margin
next to Matthew 27.

33:19.564 --> 33:20.941
"Who forgives God?"

33:20.966 --> 33:23.378
I'm already getting a headache
thinking about it.

33:23.401 --> 33:27.042
Gas station receipts. The guy gets around.

33:27.072 --> 33:31.111
Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Queens,

33:31.142 --> 33:32.951
Hoboken...

33:33.979 --> 33:35.515
Delawanna, New Jersey?

33:40.519 --> 33:42.499
That's all we've got for Kevin Donovan.

33:42.521 --> 33:45.024
- Sign it out here.
- I know it should be in here.

33:51.530 --> 33:54.033
Melanie Grasso, Delawanna, New Jersey.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.308
Connie, sweetie,

33:58.336 --> 34:02.182
go into the other room and play with
your sisters, okay, so Mommy can talk?

34:03.808 --> 34:06.118
I don't know why you want
to come all the way out here.

34:06.144 --> 34:08.784
I'm not a parishioner at St. Justin's.

34:08.813 --> 34:11.453
We go to Our Lady of Lourdes
here at Delawanna.

34:17.155 --> 34:19.465
You're active in your church?

34:19.491 --> 34:22.597
Yes. I'm head of the Rosary Society.

34:22.627 --> 34:24.469
How long have you lived here?

34:24.496 --> 34:27.033
16 years.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.545
My husband grew up in this parish.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.481
We got married in the church here.

34:32.504 --> 34:35.643
Before that, you were a
parishioner at St. Justin's.

34:35.674 --> 34:38.951
- That's what the records show.
- Yes.

34:38.976 --> 34:41.480
Father McShale was a priest there.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.356
You knew him.

34:45.850 --> 34:48.524
Yes, but I don't know what--

34:49.521 --> 34:52.797
I read what happened
in the papers, but I don't know.

34:52.824 --> 34:55.703
Father McShale admitted
to killing Kevin Donovan,

34:55.726 --> 34:58.173
the young man who worked at the church.

34:58.196 --> 35:01.302
He said that Kevin was his lover.

35:05.136 --> 35:08.276
Do you know any reason
why we shouldn't believe him?

35:21.820 --> 35:24.630
You were very young when you met him.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.499
Oh, God.

35:27.993 --> 35:30.166
He took advantage of you, of your faith?

35:30.195 --> 35:33.301
No. No, no, no. Michael was--

35:33.331 --> 35:35.311
we loved each other.

35:39.170 --> 35:40.911
And you got pregnant?

35:46.845 --> 35:49.121
Kevin Donovan was your son?

35:54.486 --> 35:57.262
- Does anyone know?
- No.

35:59.524 --> 36:01.970
Michael said that he would make sure.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.599
If anyone found out--

36:04.629 --> 36:07.166
if my own children-- what it would do them.

36:10.301 --> 36:12.474
Did you have any contact with Kevin?

36:15.140 --> 36:17.142
I was afraid.

36:20.478 --> 36:23.152
Michael said he was well cared for.

36:24.315 --> 36:29.196
And later, when Michael told me
about Kevin's problems,

36:29.220 --> 36:32.929
what he was like, his anger,

36:32.957 --> 36:37.372
he was worried what Kevin might do
if he found out about me.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.807
Mrs. Grasso, we found you

36:40.832 --> 36:43.836
because Kevin had your name
and address in his wallet.

36:45.503 --> 36:47.505
Oh my God.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.648
Oh, Michael.

36:57.348 --> 36:59.692
So much for the battered spouse defense.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.096
McShale killed Donovan
to keep him away from her.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.100
Now we're about to do
what Donovan couldn't--

37:04.122 --> 37:06.329
we're going to throw
a hand grenade into her life.

37:06.357 --> 37:08.428
No choice. Carver has
to put her on the stand.

37:08.460 --> 37:11.441
It doesn't bother you what's going
to happen to her and her family?

37:11.463 --> 37:13.602
Kevin Donovan happens
to be part of her family.

37:13.631 --> 37:16.737
She owns half of what he became.
She's no innocent bystander.

37:16.768 --> 37:20.181
So it's worth it to you wrecking this
life just to see McShale go to prison?

37:20.205 --> 37:22.776
Listen to you. What did you think
you were doing here?

37:22.807 --> 37:24.912
Some sort of catch-and-release program?

37:24.943 --> 37:27.924
Two people are dead because of McShale.
He's going away.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.358
You're not gonna make me
feel guilty about this.

37:32.150 --> 37:35.962
Two days, as a favor.

37:35.987 --> 37:39.764
We hold off telling Carver
about Melanie Grasso.

37:54.839 --> 37:58.252
I told your office I wanted
to speak to him alone.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.687
You know better than that.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.959
I want to talk about Melanie Grasso.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.968
It's okay. You can leave us alone.

38:19.464 --> 38:22.673
Whatever he tells you is off the record.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.629
What do you know about Melanie?

38:39.651 --> 38:41.130
Enough.

38:41.152 --> 38:44.133
We found her name in Kevin's wallet.

38:46.157 --> 38:49.468
Paid her a visit.

38:49.494 --> 38:52.202
She has a nice family, a nice life.

38:52.230 --> 38:53.800
One worth protecting.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.648
When did he find out?

38:59.671 --> 39:02.277
This is just between us, Father.

39:05.944 --> 39:07.924
Several weeks ago.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.927
Did he threaten to extort her?

39:10.949 --> 39:13.088
Yeah.

39:13.117 --> 39:15.063
You couldn't let that happen.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.091
No.

39:18.122 --> 39:20.932
You knew what he was capable of.

39:20.959 --> 39:24.998
You couldn't go to the police
without the whole story coming out.

39:26.631 --> 39:28.633
What are you going to do?

39:38.643 --> 39:40.953
If there's a trial

39:40.979 --> 39:44.085
on this abused spouse defense...

39:46.150 --> 39:49.324
The DA will call
Melanie Grasso as a witness...

39:51.990 --> 39:54.994
To provide an alternate motive
for your crime.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.674
The thing is...

40:03.167 --> 40:05.875
That might work out for you, too.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.842
The jurors might feel sympathetic.

40:12.343 --> 40:15.324
A hung jury might force the DA

40:15.346 --> 40:18.122
to shave a few years off a plea bargain.

40:21.352 --> 40:23.354
Can't know that till the trial.

40:28.293 --> 40:30.534
If there's a trial.

40:38.703 --> 40:42.378
The DA offered you 25 years to life.
You take that offer,

40:42.407 --> 40:46.048
and Mrs. Grasso can stay
in Delawanna and no one's the wiser.

40:49.213 --> 40:53.355
You've done the noble thing all these years.

40:53.384 --> 40:55.887
Now is not the time to stop.

41:06.831 --> 41:08.674
You’re afraid of prison.

41:11.836 --> 41:14.009
25 years is a long time.

41:18.509 --> 41:24.425
I know you've asked yourself
a lot of questions about your faith,

41:24.449 --> 41:26.827
your shame...

41:28.086 --> 41:29.997
Your guilt.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.181
Maybe now and then you...

41:45.203 --> 41:47.205
Come across an answer.

42:05.323 --> 42:07.428
He took the plea.

42:07.458 --> 42:11.634
His lawyer called first thing
this morning. 25 to life.

42:11.662 --> 42:13.801
Why would McShale do that, Detective?

42:13.831 --> 42:15.572
I don't know.

42:15.600 --> 42:18.547
You should know. I found out you
spoke with him yesterday.

42:18.569 --> 42:20.981
Spoke with him without his lawyer.

42:21.005 --> 42:22.507
Did you threaten him?

42:22.540 --> 42:24.645
No, sir.

42:24.675 --> 42:26.382
What did you tell him?

42:27.745 --> 42:30.123
How a trial would cause pain
and embarrassment

42:30.148 --> 42:32.128
to an innocent third party.

42:32.150 --> 42:35.563
What third party? Let me take that back.

42:37.622 --> 42:39.659
Unless I want to violate my oath,

42:39.690 --> 42:42.830
I have to know that everything
McShale admits to in court

42:42.860 --> 42:44.305
will be the truth.

42:46.697 --> 42:48.870
Is motive something he has to admit to?

42:51.035 --> 42:53.845
- No.
- Then no problem.

42:58.876 --> 43:00.651
Detective...

43:12.156 --> 43:15.433
If you try and run one by me
like that again...

43:16.494 --> 43:18.667
I'll have your badge.
