WEBVTT

00:12.054 --> 00:15.421
Male:
If you wish to blink,
now would be the time.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.383
Crichton:
Just do it if you're
going to do it.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.229
Are you all right, John?

00:32.325 --> 00:34.407
Yeah, sure. No problem.
Happens all the time.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.029
Needle in the eye. No sweat.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.280
All finished.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.111
Which of you is next?

00:39.207 --> 00:41.198
You go next.

00:41.292 --> 00:43.123
I told you, I'm not
participating.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.747
But, uh...

00:44.837 --> 00:47.499
Park it in the chair and
get this over with so
we can get out of here.

00:47.590 --> 00:50.377
Man:
You're not comfortable
here, my dear?

00:50.468 --> 00:52.424
Is it my reputation?

00:52.511 --> 00:55.253
It's your reputation, NamTar,
that led us here.

00:55.348 --> 01:00.092
Rygel:
Yes, it certainly is an honor
to meet such a learned scientist as yourself

01:00.186 --> 01:03.144
and to take part in his grand
experiments.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.932
You sure that this is worth
a stick in the eye?

01:08.027 --> 01:09.892
You do want to go home,
don't you, John?

01:09.987 --> 01:12.273
NamTar may have data that
Moya is lacking.

01:12.365 --> 01:14.321
Data that we're desperately
in need of.

01:17.036 --> 01:18.992
Crichton:
You're looking for a
DNA sample, right?

01:19.080 --> 01:20.661
Can't you just take a
skin scraping?

01:20.748 --> 01:25.117
NamTar:
If I were working merely at the
double helix level, yes.

01:25.211 --> 01:27.953
But to provide you with the
information you desire...

01:28.047 --> 01:29.457
Is this going to take long?

01:29.548 --> 01:32.381
Moments, mere moments.

01:38.057 --> 01:41.049
Kornata, your assistance.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.322
I will do each of you in turn.

02:01.414 --> 02:05.999
But beautiful Zhaan, l have
chosen to do yours first.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.618
Go ahead, Zhaan.

02:43.706 --> 02:46.038
Enjoy.

02:46.125 --> 02:50.994
My genetic database holds
information on nearly
eleven million species.

02:51.088 --> 02:55.206
It is simple for me to take
a genetic sampling of a
particular being

02:55.301 --> 02:58.338
and pinpoint the location
of its origin.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.282
That's my home.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.203
Rygel:
You're going to do this
for me too, right?

03:30.294 --> 03:33.912
Provide you with a genetic map
to your home world?

03:34.006 --> 03:36.383
A map that will allow you
to make the journey

03:36.467 --> 03:40.710
and avoid any Peacekeeper
jurisdictions along the way?

03:40.805 --> 03:45.139
That is what you came here
for isn't it?

03:48.979 --> 03:51.015
(disappointed sigh )

03:51.107 --> 03:56.227
NamTar:
I am delighted l have the
very thing you each desire so strongly.

03:56.821 --> 03:59.312
And now, my price.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.193
Rygel:
Ah, yes.

04:01.283 --> 04:04.320
I believe I told you when
| first contacted you
that our resources

04:04.412 --> 04:05.868
are somewhat well... limited.

04:05.955 --> 04:09.539
You arrived here aboard a
Leviathan ship did you not?

04:09.625 --> 04:11.581
You want our ship?

04:11.669 --> 04:15.708
My interest isn't in your ship,
but in your ship's Pilot.

04:15.798 --> 04:17.163
What do you want with him?

04:17.258 --> 04:19.840
My research will be
greatly enhanced

04:19.927 --> 04:24.591
by genetic material from such
an extraordinary species.

04:24.682 --> 04:27.344
You mean, a sample like
you took from us?

04:27.435 --> 04:30.347
A sample, yes.

04:30.438 --> 04:34.272
But I'm afraid I'm going to need
a bit more than I asked of you.

04:34.358 --> 04:36.394
How much more?

04:36.485 --> 04:38.567
I will require...

04:40.030 --> 04:42.362
one of your Pilot's arms.

04:57.381 --> 04:59.246
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

04:59.341 --> 05:02.925
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

05:03.012 --> 05:05.503
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

05:05.598 --> 05:08.965
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms...

05:09.059 --> 05:09.923
Help me...

05:10.019 --> 05:11.384
Listen, please.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.470
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

05:13.564 --> 05:17.682
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

05:17.776 --> 05:20.153
...doing everything I can...

05:20.237 --> 05:22.819
I'm just looking for
a way home.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.444
Don't you want to analyse
it before...

06:05.324 --> 06:07.906
You're usually so careful
about these things.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.370
Neurotically careful.

06:11.497 --> 06:12.907
What's wrong?

06:14.083 --> 06:16.199
l have to get back to you
on that one.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.460
You know, you're no worse off
than you were a couple
of arns ago.

06:20.548 --> 06:23.711
So NamTar didn't have Earth
on his data stores.

06:25.928 --> 06:29.921
Eleven million species.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.178
Eleven million, and he couldn't
at least narrow it down for me?

06:33.269 --> 06:35.134
I mean sure, he can't pinpoint
the exact location

06:35.229 --> 06:37.766
but am I even in the
neighborhood here?

06:37.856 --> 06:40.438
He sure as hell pinpointed
the others, no problem.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.530
What's your problem?

06:45.614 --> 06:48.276
Hey, you know, you didn't even
let him poke you in the eye.

06:48.367 --> 06:53.157
You don't even know if he's
got your home world in his
big ball of wonders.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.987
Have you forgotten?

06:55.082 --> 06:59.075
You and the others are trying
to get home avoiding
Peacekeeper territories.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.251
My home is Peacekeeper
territories.

07:01.338 --> 07:04.250
It's just that I can't ever
go back there.

07:05.426 --> 07:06.541
Even

07:14.852 --> 07:17.093
Have you forgotten?

07:17.605 --> 07:19.470
NamTar's demand.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.726
I mean, unless Pilot volunteers
one of his arms,

07:21.817 --> 07:25.355
we're all going to be blasting
out of here together in about
one hour.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.144
One arn.

07:27.239 --> 07:29.195
You saw the looks on
the other's faces.

07:29.283 --> 07:33.196
What makes you think they're
going to wait for Pilot to
volunteer anything?

07:33.287 --> 07:34.652
Pilot:
What do you think you're doing?

07:34.747 --> 07:35.907
Pilot, please.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.613
l'm implore you, just listen.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.699
Listen to what? How dare you!

07:39.793 --> 07:43.035
NamTar has offered us something
we cannot obtain anywhere else.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.337
Think about somebody else
for a change.

07:45.424 --> 07:48.336
I will help ease your pain.

07:51.347 --> 07:52.757
Now, D'argo.

07:56.602 --> 07:57.466
No!

07:57.561 --> 07:59.643
( screaming )

08:11.450 --> 08:14.658
D'argo:
We have upheld our end of
the bargain, NamTar.

08:14.745 --> 08:17.532
Yes, you have. Splendidly.

08:17.623 --> 08:19.579
And I will uphold mine.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.204
It will take me a short while
to load the cartographs

08:22.294 --> 08:25.707
to all three of your home worlds
into the crystal.

08:25.798 --> 08:27.538
How much of a while?

08:27.633 --> 08:31.171
I sense you don't
completely trust me.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.126
But you needn't worry.

08:33.222 --> 08:36.305
The crystal will be delivered
to your ship shortly.

08:36.392 --> 08:38.348
We will await your messenger.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.351
Kornata.

09:00.416 --> 09:05.786
Let us hope the Pilot DNA
shows better results.

09:06.296 --> 09:14.419
( screeching )

09:25.232 --> 09:28.099
Thank you, you are finished.

09:30.446 --> 09:33.188
I said you are finished.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.274
Don't concern yourself,
Crichton.

09:37.369 --> 09:39.075
I will be fine.

09:39.163 --> 09:42.997
My species has superior
regenerative capabilities.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.324
So you, um...

09:45.419 --> 09:47.205
you let them cut off
one of your arms.

09:47.296 --> 09:50.584
I didn't exactly let them.

09:50.674 --> 09:53.416
They have the opportunity
to go home.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.217
The drive is very strong.

09:56.305 --> 10:00.344
I will never understand
you people.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.720
How can you not be angry?

10:03.395 --> 10:04.976
Insanely angry?

10:05.063 --> 10:08.772
When one of my species is
bonded to a Leviathan,

10:08.859 --> 10:11.726
we give our lives to the
service of others.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.778
Ship first, then those who
travel aboard her.

10:14.865 --> 10:18.357
No matter what those
aboard do to you?

10:18.452 --> 10:22.161
My species is incapable of
spaceflight on our own.

10:22.247 --> 10:27.332
If we wish to journey beyond our
home planet, this is the
tradeoff we make,

10:27.419 --> 10:30.252
for the chance to see
the galaxy.

10:30.339 --> 10:35.003
I consider it a perfectly
equitable arrangement.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.020
Do you have something
to say to us?

10:50.317 --> 10:53.024
The decision was a
hard one, Aeryn.

10:53.111 --> 10:56.069
Our actions even harder.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.236
But it is done.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.689
How could you?

10:59.451 --> 11:01.316
Pilot is defenseless.

11:01.411 --> 11:04.574
Compassion? From a Peacekeeper?

11:04.665 --> 11:06.246
For a comrade.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.666
You attacked one of your own.

11:09.753 --> 11:12.210
Would you do the same
to the rest of us?

11:14.299 --> 11:16.130
Of course.

11:17.261 --> 11:18.717
Well, you have your maps now.

11:18.804 --> 11:21.341
What makes you think you
can just take this ship
wherever you want to go?

11:21.431 --> 11:25.424
These maps are precisely what
we've been longing for.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.267
Our way home.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.686
Pilot will not help you after
what you have done to him.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.014
Pilot is a servicer.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.770
He'll get over it.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.602
I'll see to it.

11:40.242 --> 11:43.109
I know what is troubling
you, my dear.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.285
You'll never find your way home.

11:45.372 --> 11:50.332
But please, do not deny us all
our chance to find our own.

12:04.850 --> 12:08.183
Aeryn:
They're getting their maps.

12:08.270 --> 12:11.137
(drunkenly):
Pilot says he's going
to be okay.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.894
It's only one of his arms.
Hell, he's got four.

12:14.985 --> 12:18.318
I guess that makes you and
me the odd men out.

12:21.533 --> 12:24.195
That means they're going home,
and we're not.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.489
Hey. You know, even
with the maps,

12:30.584 --> 12:33.667
it's still going to take them
some time to make the trips.

12:38.508 --> 12:41.545
And then it's just you and me.

12:41.637 --> 12:45.300
Look, you know, I'm not entirely
useless here, you know.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.551
I happen to be learning.

12:57.569 --> 12:58.979
Aeryn?

12:59.821 --> 13:01.402
What's the matter?

13:06.203 --> 13:08.569
They are going home.

13:08.664 --> 13:12.998
And someday, you will, too.

13:13.085 --> 13:14.120
Yeah. Sure.

13:14.211 --> 13:17.703
I mean, if I ever find
a way home, yeah.

13:17.798 --> 13:21.165
l was born a Peacekeeper
soldier.

13:21.259 --> 13:23.295
I've always been one among many.

13:24.763 --> 13:29.473
A member of a division,
a platoon, a unit, a team.

13:32.938 --> 13:35.475
I've never been on my own, John.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.523
Never been alone.

13:39.403 --> 13:40.734
Even

13:40.821 --> 13:44.234
When I find a way home, if...

13:44.324 --> 13:47.691
if I find a way home, l'll,
I'll take you with me.

13:49.079 --> 13:52.287
Me on a planet full of
billions of you?

13:56.670 --> 13:58.080
Rygel:
Get out!

13:59.089 --> 14:00.329
Out!

14:01.341 --> 14:04.208
( muttering )

14:08.473 --> 14:10.213
Ah. So sorry.

14:10.308 --> 14:13.345
I came to inform you that the
data crystal is on its way.

14:13.437 --> 14:14.768
What is all this?

14:14.855 --> 14:19.269
Mmm, just items that I've
procured since our escape.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.190
To aid us in our bartering.

14:21.278 --> 14:25.647
Of course, when | return home
and reclaim my birthright,

14:25.741 --> 14:30.110
Offal such as this will
no longer be allowed to
offend my sight.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.577
A box of food cubes?

14:35.667 --> 14:37.123
My emergency supply.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.201
In case something came up.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.708
How long have you had these for?

14:42.799 --> 14:47.338
Were they in your possession
when we were without food
for nearly two weekens?

14:47.429 --> 14:50.136
You see? Something did come up.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.465
If you like them, they're yours.

14:53.560 --> 14:58.145
You have not reclaimed your
birthright yet, little man.

15:00.317 --> 15:04.356
I did not expect Aeryn to share
our excitement, but Crichton's
attitude surprises me.

15:04.446 --> 15:08.780
lf NamTar's knowledge had
extended to Crichton's
pathetic home world,

15:08.867 --> 15:11.233
you can wager that he would have
offered up his own mevonks,

15:11.328 --> 15:12.738
useless as they are.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.115
Would you, if that had been
the price demanded?

15:15.207 --> 15:16.322
Fortunately, it was not.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.203
Only a female would make
light of such a thought.

15:19.294 --> 15:20.795
l was not making light.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.870
And you.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.455
What would you have given?

15:25.550 --> 15:28.166
I would risk my pneuma for
the chance to go home.

15:28.261 --> 15:33.005
NamTar has no use for
that out here.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.763
I'm surprised that he has stayed
out here in the Uncharted
Territories.

15:36.853 --> 15:40.186
His knowledge could bring him
great fame and power.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.683
Even great wealth.

15:41.775 --> 15:44.687
It could change the entire basis
of astronavigation.

15:44.778 --> 15:48.270
It would change the basis for
war.

15:48.365 --> 15:54.201
One single prisoner and you
would have the ability to
strike at their very heart.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.367
Their homeland.

15:55.455 --> 15:59.915
You would pervert NamTar's
genius to a weapon?

16:00.001 --> 16:01.616
Why not?

16:01.711 --> 16:04.202
Somebody will.
Why shouldn't it be me?

16:04.297 --> 16:06.128
You still feel pain
from the needle?

16:06.216 --> 16:07.296
It's nothing.

16:07.384 --> 16:10.672
And soon forgotten, once we're
on our voyage home.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.756
On Delvia the filgran will be
just coming into bloom.

16:15.851 --> 16:19.935
My parents will be preparing for
the festival of Pedrark.

16:20.021 --> 16:25.641
There is no need for them to
keep my seat vacant at this
cycle's festival.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.444
If you reach there this cycle.

16:29.531 --> 16:32.568
The crystal will be arriving
from NamTar within an arn.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.990
I don't doubt.

16:34.077 --> 16:37.069
But there are decisions to be
made, about our course.

16:39.124 --> 16:44.994
Without my Qualta blade, you
would not have been able to
give NamTar what he wanted.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.295
I will make the decisions.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.418
To suit yourself.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.886
But it is not as easy
as you wish.

16:51.970 --> 16:56.339
This is a time for
logic and reason.

16:56.433 --> 17:02.770
Unless of course you wish to
find yourself at odds with
everyone on the ship,

17:02.856 --> 17:06.189
notjust Aeryn Sun and Crichton.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.483
And what do you suggest?

17:09.279 --> 17:11.190
A fair compromise.

17:23.168 --> 17:26.160
This is still not right!

17:26.254 --> 17:27.630
( Kornata screams )

17:27.714 --> 17:28.920
What?!

17:29.007 --> 17:31.840
NamTar, your anger!

17:31.927 --> 17:33.758
Release me.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.426
Please.

17:38.225 --> 17:41.843
There is someone to see you.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.850
l was here earlier.

17:51.196 --> 17:54.279
Yes. Of course.

17:54.366 --> 17:57.233
You are looking for my help?

17:57.327 --> 17:59.943
I wish to participate
in your research.

18:00.038 --> 18:03.030
Excellent.

18:03.124 --> 18:06.366
What made you change your
mind, my dear?

18:11.383 --> 18:17.504
I know that there are other
Sebacean colonies beyond the
known territories.

18:17.597 --> 18:22.216
I want you to find me one
where l... I can...

18:22.310 --> 18:23.891
Fit in?

18:25.272 --> 18:28.685
Then we will look for
it together.

18:31.695 --> 18:34.687
You understand what I'm
about to do?

18:34.781 --> 18:36.396
You will take some fluid
from my eye.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.482
Exactly.

18:38.576 --> 18:42.694
Remain absolutely still.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.837
It's burning.

18:56.928 --> 18:59.465
Only for a moment.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.468
(gasping)

19:10.442 --> 19:11.306
Is that it?

19:11.401 --> 19:13.107
It is done.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.105
When will I know the results?

19:16.031 --> 19:18.397
It won't be long at all.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.501
l, of course, will return
home first.

19:39.596 --> 19:41.177
You? Hmm...

19:41.264 --> 19:43.220
Rygel:
l bartered for the coordinates
to this asteroid.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.765
I made the first contact
with NamTar.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.467
I struck the deal.

19:47.562 --> 19:49.018
| go home first.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.561
D'argo and l have spoken.

19:50.648 --> 19:54.482
Whoever's home is closest,
that is where we will
travel to first.

19:54.569 --> 19:56.230
You two have spoken?

19:56.321 --> 19:58.437
Hmph, without consulting me?

19:58.531 --> 20:00.442
What am I? Chopped mellet?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.239
Of course not.

20:02.327 --> 20:04.488
I can stomach chopped mellet.

20:04.579 --> 20:06.285
Blue-assed bitch.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.237
What did you call me?

20:07.332 --> 20:09.288
A blue-assed bitch!

20:10.668 --> 20:11.999
You guys getting all this?

20:12.087 --> 20:15.170
We don't have to get
all this. Moya is.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.542
Pilot:
Moya isn't.

20:17.634 --> 20:18.874
Zhaan:
Pilot, how are you?

20:18.968 --> 20:20.378
Rygel:
The yotz with pleasantries.

20:20.470 --> 20:23.303
What do you mean, Moya isn't
assimilating the data?

20:23.390 --> 20:25.722
Is that her doing or yours?

20:25.809 --> 20:28.391
l have nothing to do with it.

20:29.312 --> 20:30.643
Pilot is right.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.346
The data is being processed
directly by Moya.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.977
But there is too much.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.480
There is a great deal of data
but Moya will have to...

20:37.570 --> 20:40.152
Moya can do nothing about it.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.107
It appears your crystal
is useless.

20:43.201 --> 20:48.161
Lucky for you, you didn't
trade anything of real
value to get it.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.499
only if we destroy
the other two.

20:53.586 --> 20:57.875
Well, we'll just go to NamTar
and ask him for three
individual crystals.

20:57.966 --> 20:59.547
Ask NamTar for further help?

20:59.634 --> 21:01.135
What will he demand of us then?

21:01.219 --> 21:02.834
If he should ask for it,

21:02.929 --> 21:07.468
what body part are you willing
to offer, your eminence?

21:13.231 --> 21:14.220
Rygel!

21:15.400 --> 21:18.312
What the hezmana do you
think you are doing?

21:23.783 --> 21:27.651
(amplified beeping)

21:47.348 --> 21:48.929
Crichton:
Aeryn!

21:49.017 --> 21:50.302
Where the hell have you been?

21:50.393 --> 21:52.304
Look, there's some major crap
going down here.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.886
Shh! Not so loud.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.767
Yeah. Fine. Look,

21:56.858 --> 21:58.268
we may have a real problem.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.270
The map thing.
NamTar's magic crystal?

22:00.361 --> 22:03.569
Well, Larry, Curly and Moe just
found out they can only use
one of the maps.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.157
( voice becomes fuzzy )
Two of them ain't going nowhere.

22:05.241 --> 22:08.108
I tell you, it's like a regular
family feud up there.

22:09.287 --> 22:11.118
You sweating?

22:11.206 --> 22:13.447
This isn't a Sebacean heat
thing, is it?

22:13.541 --> 22:15.657
This is not a Sebacean thing.

22:15.752 --> 22:18.118
( echoing )
Well, you've got to give me
a clue here, Aeryn.

22:18.213 --> 22:22.331
Is this something new or is this
just your usual PMS, Peacekeeper
Military Sh...

22:22.425 --> 22:24.381
Frell you!

22:39.400 --> 22:41.436
( laughter)

22:41.528 --> 22:43.439
Rygel:
It's no use, Luxan!

22:43.530 --> 22:45.612
The crystal is well hidden.

22:45.698 --> 22:49.316
And will remain so until you and
Zhaan are ready to listen to
reason.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.696
"Reason" being that we return
you to Hyneria.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.904
That's the very definition
of "reason."

22:53.998 --> 22:56.330
I'll find the damn crystal
myself.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.544
No, I assure you you won't.

22:58.628 --> 23:05.249
l have places in this cell that
even the Peacekeepers scent
hounds couldn't detect.

23:05.343 --> 23:09.757
If you return to Hyneria you
will want to wrest your throne
from your cousin.

23:09.847 --> 23:11.348
And I will.

23:11.432 --> 23:14.048
But your cousin is in control
of your armies.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.270
He himself is probably
heavily guarded.

23:16.354 --> 23:19.141
My palace sentries are
inferior to none.

23:19.232 --> 23:23.771
His palace sentries.

23:23.861 --> 23:28.400
However, if you side with me
against Zhaan to return to
my home world first,

23:28.491 --> 23:33.827
imagine returning to your palace
with a whole contingent of Luxan
warriors at your command.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.699
But you're a fugitive.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.371
Your own people imprisoned you.

23:37.458 --> 23:42.293
My leaders imprisoned me,
not my people.

23:42.380 --> 23:47.124
If you return me to my people
I promise you that you...

23:47.218 --> 23:50.176
You'll be very forgetful of your
debt to me the instant

23:50.263 --> 23:53.005
you were safely amongst
your own.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.306
That's also a Luxan trait.

23:55.393 --> 23:57.258
And that.

23:57.353 --> 24:00.265
When you're ready to engage in
that "reason" discussion we
talked of before,

24:00.356 --> 24:03.814
you know where to find me
and the crystal.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.608
Stay in there with your crystal
as long as you wish.

24:09.699 --> 24:11.235
Until you starve.

24:11.326 --> 24:13.738
You think I'm not prepared for
such eventualities?

24:13.828 --> 24:20.370
You forget, your rectal
eminence, you've been doing
some housekeeping.

25:06.964 --> 25:07.999
(moaning)

25:08.091 --> 25:09.331
What have you done to me?

25:09.425 --> 25:13.384
You are hurting me, my dear.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.217
(moaning stops)

25:17.308 --> 25:22.598
l have temporarily turned my
nerve receptors from pain to
pleasure.

25:22.689 --> 25:25.101
This is not like what you
did to the others.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.352
Oops.

25:27.443 --> 25:28.694
Aeryn:
What have you done to me?

25:28.778 --> 25:31.941
Please... push harder.

25:34.826 --> 25:38.318
(panting)

25:39.664 --> 25:43.327
You're in the latter part of
phase one, I suspect.

25:43.418 --> 25:44.783
Phase one of what?

25:44.877 --> 25:49.871
Please.
I don't want to ruin the
surprise of phase two for you.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.300
Hynerians are extremely
devious beings.

25:54.387 --> 25:58.505
I don't doubt for an instant
that Rygel has that crystal
so well hidden

25:58.599 --> 26:00.464
we will never find it
on our own.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.427
If only I could lay my
hands on him.

26:03.521 --> 26:05.386
You would do what?

26:05.481 --> 26:08.564
Whatever it takes to secure
that crystal.

26:08.651 --> 26:11.063
We are forced to face the truth.

26:11.154 --> 26:14.362
Rygel has been a very useful
ally in the past.

26:14.449 --> 26:16.360
But now he is enemy.

26:16.451 --> 26:17.907
Agreed.

26:17.994 --> 26:20.235
You and I must remain strong
no matter what it takes.

26:20.329 --> 26:22.160
And unified.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.749
Unequivocally.

26:25.001 --> 26:26.582
Yes, Officer Sun?

26:26.669 --> 26:28.125
Aeryn:
You in pain, Pilot?

26:28.212 --> 26:30.954
Nominal. I will be fine.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.961
There is clearly
something wrong.

26:34.051 --> 26:35.336
May | ask what?

26:35.428 --> 26:36.634
It's the DRDS.

26:36.721 --> 26:38.257
DRDs? Where?

26:38.347 --> 26:40.338
Everywhere. Over this
entire ship.

26:40.433 --> 26:41.798
But it's just not the DRDs.

26:41.893 --> 26:44.805
It's the ship's power generator,
the hydraulic fluids...

26:44.896 --> 26:46.432
You hear all that?

26:46.522 --> 26:50.231
Not so much hear it as sense it.

26:50.318 --> 26:51.478
But how?

27:01.204 --> 27:05.914
It's not so much the noises
as my own thoughts.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.116
It's like they're all happening
at the same time.

27:08.211 --> 27:11.169
Aeryn!
Come on. I want to take you
back down to the planet.

27:11.255 --> 27:12.506
Hey, Pilot.

27:12.590 --> 27:14.330
I want to see if maybe we can
find somebody down there

27:14.425 --> 27:16.256
who can figure out what's
wrong with you.
Maybe this NamTar guy...

27:16.344 --> 27:17.254
No!

27:17.345 --> 27:19.336
Damn it, Aeryn, I'm
trying to hel...

27:34.862 --> 27:36.147
It's NamTar.

27:36.239 --> 27:39.857
He took some of Pilot's
DNA and he...

27:39.951 --> 27:41.157
and how did, um...?

27:41.244 --> 27:43.326
I went back there.

27:44.956 --> 27:46.696
I wanted him to find me a place
where I could belong.

27:46.791 --> 27:49.373
ldidn't want to get
left behind.

27:51.504 --> 27:53.495
I'm so scared.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.176
(grunting)

28:02.139 --> 28:04.346
(munching sounds)

28:04.433 --> 28:06.298
Ah, Rygel, what a surprise.

28:06.394 --> 28:08.305
| see you're having
something to eat.

28:08.396 --> 28:10.512
Is that your third helping
or your fourth?

28:10.606 --> 28:14.440
Well, I'm always ravenous when
I'm about to take a
long journey.

28:14.527 --> 28:18.065
In this case, to my home world.

28:20.449 --> 28:22.235
You know, Rygel,

28:22.326 --> 28:27.821
there's no reason why you and
I should be at odds with
each other.

28:27.915 --> 28:33.035
You know, D'argo will leave
you here to starve.

28:33.129 --> 28:35.165
Only D'argo?

28:35.673 --> 28:37.163
(gasps )

28:37.258 --> 28:43.049
You know Delvian Pa'us such as
myself are open to...

28:43.139 --> 28:45.721
all manner of experience.

28:47.351 --> 28:50.263
Are you saying what I
think you're saying?

28:51.147 --> 28:54.184
I'm not saying anything.

28:54.275 --> 28:58.359
I believe talk is very overrated

28:58.446 --> 29:02.906
as a means of connection between
two consenting beings.

29:05.328 --> 29:07.114
Uh... you know,

29:07.204 --> 29:09.820
I'm not really a body breeder.

29:09.916 --> 29:13.158
I mean, well, I'm not
made that way.

29:13.252 --> 29:16.085
But you do understand pleasure.

29:16.172 --> 29:18.458
( shivering )

29:19.967 --> 29:25.337
I know the Hynerian earbrow
is very sensitive.

29:26.140 --> 29:28.381
I can be very gentle.

29:28.476 --> 29:33.846
This can be a very remarkable
journey for you.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.305
Journey?

29:35.399 --> 29:37.890
Hmm... to Delvia.

29:37.985 --> 29:42.024
Delvia... of course.

29:43.366 --> 29:44.902
Rygel...

29:45.534 --> 29:46.910
the crystal.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.609
Oh... ha-ha...

29:48.704 --> 29:51.366
ls safely hidden, where
it will remain.

29:51.457 --> 29:55.120
You honestly believe that I
could find you appealing?

29:55.211 --> 29:56.496
I mean, you're so...

29:56.587 --> 29:58.123
so... blue.

29:58.214 --> 30:02.332
lf D'argo and I don't get that
crystal you will starve.

30:02.426 --> 30:03.290
Starve?

30:03.386 --> 30:06.048
Not for a while yet,
I'm pleased to say.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.093
(grunts)

30:07.181 --> 30:08.887
(crowd talking )

30:08.975 --> 30:10.431
Come on.

30:10.518 --> 30:12.304
We're going to get some answers.

30:13.854 --> 30:15.355
Oh, no, no, no, no.

30:15.439 --> 30:17.771
Remember what Pilot said about
the noise, about your thoughts.

30:17.858 --> 30:19.018
String them.

30:19.110 --> 30:21.522
Separate them in your mind.

30:23.114 --> 30:26.322
Easy for him to say.
He's been doing it all his life.

30:26.409 --> 30:29.822
(gasping)

30:32.081 --> 30:34.288
I'm losing it, John.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.957
I'm completely losing it.

30:39.588 --> 30:41.965
Answers coming up. Come on.

30:44.677 --> 30:46.918
You got a minute?
Kornata, isn't it?

30:47.013 --> 30:48.128
You must let me past...

30:48.222 --> 30:50.087
( screams )

30:50.182 --> 30:53.219
What? What's wrong with you?
With all of you?

30:59.066 --> 31:02.604
So glad to see you again.

31:02.695 --> 31:06.608
Crichton:
Whatever you've done to her,
NamTar, it wasn't part of our deal.

31:06.699 --> 31:10.317
Deal? You felt we had a deal?

31:10.411 --> 31:13.244
A deal connotes reaching
some point of equality.

31:13.330 --> 31:17.448
I'm afraid there's never been
anything equal about us.

31:18.294 --> 31:20.330
How are you progressing?

31:20.421 --> 31:24.334
You should be nearing the end
of phase two by now.

31:27.094 --> 31:28.800
(grunting)

31:46.489 --> 31:48.195
Hmm...

31:49.241 --> 31:52.449
You're coming along wonderfully.

31:55.289 --> 31:59.908
All of these physical
affectations are superfluous.

32:00.002 --> 32:02.414
I assume, though, that you
are also developing

32:02.505 --> 32:06.123
the heightened perception and
multi-tasking capability?

32:06.217 --> 32:07.753
Please stop this.

32:07.843 --> 32:11.210
Stop it? You don't know
what you're asking.

32:11.305 --> 32:14.513
You, my dear, are making a
phenomenal contribution

32:14.600 --> 32:17.967
to the approach of sentient life
toward perfection,

32:18.062 --> 32:20.269
and you want me to stop it?

32:23.150 --> 32:24.139
Aeryn, no!

32:24.235 --> 32:26.521
He may be the only one
who can help you.

32:38.124 --> 32:42.208
That's quite an impressive
weapon you've got there.

33:26.422 --> 33:27.662
Rygel...

33:27.756 --> 33:29.542
D'argo and l have spoken.

33:29.633 --> 33:33.125
We realize all this infighting
is serving us nothing,

33:33.220 --> 33:36.383
except to keep us frozen in
orbit around this asteroid.

33:36.473 --> 33:40.341
We, uh, we acknowledge that
you're in control of the crystal

33:40.436 --> 33:43.269
and without it, we can do
nothing, so, uh...

33:43.355 --> 33:47.223
So we agree to take you
home to Hyneria.

33:47.318 --> 33:50.025
We'll find our own way
home from there.

33:50.112 --> 33:52.603
You have our oath on it, Rygel.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.154
Rygel?

34:01.624 --> 34:03.580
D'argo:
He did not hear our offer...

34:03.667 --> 34:05.919
and I hereby rescind it.

34:07.129 --> 34:08.994
Rygel:
Mmm...

34:09.089 --> 34:12.422
( Rygel chuckling )

34:12.509 --> 34:14.374
I didn't hear all you were
offering, I'm afraid.

34:14.470 --> 34:18.008
But then, I guess it's a
moot point anyway isn't it?

34:18.098 --> 34:19.929
How did you get out?

34:20.017 --> 34:23.555
You really think that I could
spend all those cycles locked
in one of these cells

34:27.358 --> 34:29.815
Now, if you'll excuse me,

34:29.902 --> 34:32.188
l have a little trip
planning to do.

34:32.279 --> 34:34.019
Rygel, wait!

34:37.576 --> 34:38.861
(gasps )

34:38.953 --> 34:41.069
You're wound is shallow.
You'll be fine.

34:41.163 --> 34:44.246
Leave this place now,
while you still can.

34:47.002 --> 34:49.414
Wait! I'm going to help her.

34:49.505 --> 34:50.836
You've got to help me help her.

34:50.923 --> 34:53.255
NamTar needs your friend
too badly.

34:53.342 --> 34:56.129
He wants to isolate your Pilot's
multi-tasking capability
through Aeryn.

34:56.220 --> 34:57.505
He'll do anything to get it.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.837
Why? Why does he need it
so damn bad?

34:59.932 --> 35:03.470
Because it's an ability he
doesn't possess yet.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.175
Wait a minute.

35:05.271 --> 35:09.605
You're saying he grafts the
genetic traits of other species
onto himself?

35:11.151 --> 35:12.527
That's what he set up
this lab to do?

35:12.611 --> 35:15.068
He didn't set up this lab. I...

35:16.198 --> 35:18.314
You did?

35:18.409 --> 35:21.276
l was the project leader.

35:21.370 --> 35:23.952
These were my research team,

35:24.039 --> 35:27.327
facility employees.

35:27.418 --> 35:31.127
We were working on theories of
quantum genetics, isolating,

35:31.213 --> 35:36.253
identifying the origins of
intellect, the essentials
of thought itself.

35:37.511 --> 35:43.632
NamTar started to use your
discoveries on himself?

35:43.726 --> 35:45.591
I increased his intellect.

35:45.686 --> 35:48.052
At least at first.

35:48.147 --> 35:51.810
Then when he became smart enough
he began doing it on his own.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.731
He was a test subject.

35:53.819 --> 35:57.858
(chuckling):
He was one of my laboratory
creatures.

35:57.948 --> 36:02.112
He drew genetic material from
all the species I had
catalogued.

36:02.202 --> 36:03.942
He increased his physical size.

36:04.038 --> 36:08.247
He gave himself the best traits
of life-forms from a thousand
different worlds.

36:08.334 --> 36:11.292
Now he's using Aeryn as
his own lab rat.

36:11.378 --> 36:13.460
He used us all.

36:13.547 --> 36:15.253
Is there anything we can
do to help her?

36:15.341 --> 36:17.172
He controls my lab,
all my equipment.

36:17.259 --> 36:20.092
If I'm away for more than an am
he comes looking for me.

36:20.179 --> 36:21.589
He knows that I am the only...

36:21.680 --> 36:23.341
Is there?

36:26.685 --> 36:30.644
Aeryn:
Is it necessary to reduce me
fully to the final stage?

36:30.731 --> 36:33.473
You are in no way being
diminished.

36:33.567 --> 36:36.434
You are being given a gift.

36:36.528 --> 36:43.991
You are experiencing a level of
intellectual processing few
beings ever approach.

36:44.078 --> 36:47.286
I feel what you describe, but...

36:47.373 --> 36:49.204
lam slipping away.

36:49.291 --> 36:51.156
| feel that, too.

36:51.251 --> 36:54.584
You must be willing to push off
from the riskless shore

36:54.671 --> 36:57.504
in order to reach heady
new lands.

36:57.591 --> 37:00.173
But as soon my body reaches
the saturation point

37:00.260 --> 37:04.173
you will take the DNA features
you desire and discard the rest.

37:04.264 --> 37:11.136
I look forward to experiencing
the insights you obviously
already possess.

37:23.117 --> 37:25.199
(humming)

37:25.285 --> 37:28.618
(tones warbling )

37:32.251 --> 37:34.287
D'argo, look, just stop.

37:34.378 --> 37:36.209
Don't force it. Just let me try.

37:36.296 --> 37:38.423
You've been trying.

37:39.299 --> 37:40.459
A decoy.

37:40.551 --> 37:43.634
How did such a great warrior
fall for such an obvious trick?

37:43.720 --> 37:45.176
You blame me?

37:45.264 --> 37:48.677
lfl hadn't listen to your
frodank of an idea
about a deal...

37:48.767 --> 37:51.008
You had no better idea.

37:51.103 --> 37:55.312
I wanted to kill him, and I
swear that when | get out
of here I will enjoy watching him die.

37:55.399 --> 37:58.061
When you get out of here?

37:58.152 --> 38:01.360
Well, to this point your
assistance has been worse
than useless.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.529
You gave your word we
work together.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.571
And you gave yours.

38:05.659 --> 38:08.241
I saw you leaving this
corridor earlier.

38:08.328 --> 38:11.786
l was merely asking Rygel
to see reason.

38:11.874 --> 38:14.490
A deal that you didn't bother
to mention to me.

38:14.585 --> 38:17.497
Had I succeeded, of course
I would have discussed
it with you.

38:17.588 --> 38:21.672
Had you succeeded, you would
be on your way to Delvia.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.498
Crichton!

38:23.594 --> 38:24.549
Aeryn!

38:24.636 --> 38:26.297
You're wasting your time.

38:26.388 --> 38:30.472
I do not wish to grow old here
watching you scratch
at that lock

38:30.559 --> 38:33.801
like some scabrous scent hound.

38:34.980 --> 38:38.017
Crichton:
Pilot, this is Kornata.

38:38.108 --> 38:40.224
She's here to help Aeryn.

38:40.736 --> 38:44.149
You're magnificent.

38:44.239 --> 38:46.491
Crichton:
Pilot, we don't have
a lot of time.

38:46.575 --> 38:48.406
In fact, we have no time.

38:48.494 --> 38:49.779
We need your assistance.

38:49.870 --> 38:53.237
Without hesitation.

38:53.332 --> 38:55.789
Kornata:
I need a titus scan of each of
the last three inert mixtures.

38:55.876 --> 38:59.209
Also, the expanded graph matches
the latest spectral analysis

38:59.296 --> 39:01.503
and all final recounts of
the cyyto-batch data.

39:01.590 --> 39:03.046
Working on them all.

39:03.133 --> 39:05.340
Look, if there's anything
I can do...

39:05.427 --> 39:06.462
Shh...

39:06.553 --> 39:08.589
Crichton, I think you
should know.

39:08.680 --> 39:12.673
Rygel has nearly finished
reconfiguring the data on
the cartographic crystal.

39:12.768 --> 39:14.349
The crystal that NamTar
gave you?

39:14.436 --> 39:16.301
Yeah. Why?

39:16.396 --> 39:18.933
NamTar wanted to make certain
you couldn't leave even if
you wanted to.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.640
If you try to import the maps
into the ship's data store

39:21.735 --> 39:23.191
it'll erase everything
that's in there.

39:23.278 --> 39:24.142
(gasps )

39:24.238 --> 39:26.024
Erase Moya's memory?

39:26.114 --> 39:27.320
Rygel?

39:27.991 --> 39:29.401
Rygel!

39:29.868 --> 39:30.653
Damn!

39:30.744 --> 39:32.655
( scraping )

39:32.746 --> 39:34.611
( frustrated grunt )

39:34.706 --> 39:37.288
(metal joints whining)

39:41.922 --> 39:43.082
No!

39:43.173 --> 39:44.128
Crichton, this is...

39:44.216 --> 39:46.252
( snarling )

39:46.343 --> 39:47.708
( snarls )

39:49.596 --> 39:51.461
( snarling )

39:51.557 --> 39:53.422
(distorted yelling )

40:04.861 --> 40:08.399
(hissing)

40:29.219 --> 40:30.800
What have you done?

40:30.887 --> 40:33.799
lt would've destroyed all
of Moya's data.

40:35.517 --> 40:37.758
It was never meant to work.

40:39.563 --> 40:40.313
Pilot:
Crichton?

40:40.397 --> 40:42.262
Pilot here.

40:42.357 --> 40:44.097
Yes, Pilot?

40:44.651 --> 40:45.982
It's ready.

40:56.788 --> 41:00.121
Where have you been?

41:00.208 --> 41:04.247
The final stage serum is nearly
complete and I need your help.

41:10.260 --> 41:13.172
If you've come to attack me
yet again,

41:13.263 --> 41:16.847
I warn you, I don't have
time for you now.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.548
I will need to simply kill you.

41:18.644 --> 41:21.101
Crichton:
I'm not here to attack you.

41:21.188 --> 41:24.396
I know there's nothing that
I can do to you.

41:26.109 --> 41:27.394
I'm here to see Aeryn.

41:27.486 --> 41:31.320
I'm afraid your friend Aeryn
is no longer here,

41:31.406 --> 41:36.116
but there is someone else you
may be interested in meeting.

41:41.375 --> 41:43.240
Rise.

41:43.335 --> 41:45.576
Step forward.

41:45.671 --> 41:47.502
Don't be modest.

41:57.599 --> 41:59.430
John.

42:01.353 --> 42:02.843
How can you do this to her?

42:02.938 --> 42:07.523
Is that how you speak to someone
who is fast approaching
perfection?

42:07.609 --> 42:10.476
You're a long way from
perfection, NamTar.

42:10.570 --> 42:16.156
But nearer, possibly, than any
other corporeal being
has ever come.

42:16.243 --> 42:19.326
Give credit where credit is due.

42:19.413 --> 42:24.703
You expect credit for using
innocent life-forms as specimens
in your research?

42:24.793 --> 42:27.535
You, of all people, should
understand the horror in that.

42:27.629 --> 42:31.588
You know of my origins?

42:31.675 --> 42:34.337
Yeah.

42:34.428 --> 42:39.422
What I didn't understand then is
all species are seeking
perfection.

42:39.516 --> 42:46.263
That's what evolution is,
the road towards perfection.

42:46.356 --> 42:50.099
How many generations of your
species have lived and died
to lead to you?

42:50.193 --> 42:53.310
How many will die after you?

42:53.405 --> 42:58.195
All in the name of achieving
a state of perfection.

43:00.120 --> 43:03.408
You don't think I understand
you, do you?

43:03.498 --> 43:06.240
Oh, I understand.

43:06.334 --> 43:09.576
No, believe it or not we've had
men like you on my planet.

43:10.297 --> 43:13.130
Educated men.

43:13.216 --> 43:16.549
Men of science and medicine.

43:16.636 --> 43:20.504
Men who were searching for some
self-described ideal

43:20.599 --> 43:25.184
and willing to maim and murder
untold thousands to find it.

43:25.270 --> 43:26.771
There was one.

43:26.855 --> 43:30.723
His name was Mengele.

43:30.817 --> 43:33.650
To him, anyone was fair game as
a subject of his experiments.

43:33.737 --> 43:40.654
The weak, the handicapped,
men, women, children.

43:40.744 --> 43:44.862
The quest for perfection demands
our unwavering devotion.

43:44.956 --> 43:48.244
This Mengele sounds
like a visionary.

43:49.711 --> 43:51.212
He was a monster.

43:52.255 --> 43:55.122
( screaming )

43:55.217 --> 43:57.173
(yells)

43:57.260 --> 43:59.216
(groaning)

44:00.222 --> 44:04.306
For this betrayal, you will die.

44:04.392 --> 44:06.303
(painful yelling)

44:07.354 --> 44:08.890
(hissing)

44:08.980 --> 44:10.231
(roaring)

44:10.315 --> 44:12.601
( screaming )

44:19.241 --> 44:22.233
( NamTar crying )

44:33.129 --> 44:36.872
( crying )

44:56.236 --> 44:57.942
John...

44:58.029 --> 44:59.189
Help me!

45:01.408 --> 45:03.490
(grunting painfully)

45:03.577 --> 45:05.909
(panting)

45:07.205 --> 45:08.581
Kornata.

45:11.668 --> 45:13.374
(panting painfully)

45:14.337 --> 45:15.838
No!

45:17.465 --> 45:19.205
For her,

45:20.635 --> 45:22.296
it must be the eye.

45:22.387 --> 45:24.127
(groans nervously)

45:27.183 --> 45:28.514
(grunting approval)

45:37.027 --> 45:39.268
( groans )

45:39.362 --> 45:41.569
(grunting and panting)

45:42.490 --> 45:44.321
Oh, no, what have I done?

45:45.702 --> 45:46.782
( choking )

45:46.870 --> 45:47.950
What have I done?

45:48.038 --> 45:49.994
What have you done?

45:50.081 --> 45:52.117
You've saved her life.

45:54.377 --> 45:56.959
(grunting)

46:06.097 --> 46:09.214
(whooshing )

46:23.323 --> 46:25.279
It's a happy face.

46:25.367 --> 46:26.573
They're food cubes.

46:26.660 --> 46:29.276
No, see the pattern,
it forms a...

46:31.456 --> 46:33.287
Never mind.

46:39.965 --> 46:42.126
Food still tastes funny?

46:47.847 --> 46:49.803
What was the worst part?

46:53.395 --> 46:54.805
Aeryn...

46:57.273 --> 47:01.186
I've always thought of myself
in terms of survival.

47:01.277 --> 47:03.268
Life and death.

47:03.363 --> 47:05.354
Keeping the body alive.

47:06.074 --> 47:08.690
But what NamTar did to me,

47:11.287 --> 47:13.414
it we...

47:17.210 --> 47:19.917
it was me.

47:20.422 --> 47:22.788
Inside.

47:23.341 --> 47:25.582
The real me.

47:28.221 --> 47:30.883
You would've fit in on Earth...

47:31.474 --> 47:33.339
just fine.

47:54.080 --> 47:56.196
Your arm.

47:56.291 --> 47:57.155
Is it healing?

47:57.250 --> 47:59.161
Of course.

48:00.253 --> 48:02.209
You understand why I did
what I did?

48:02.297 --> 48:05.039
Your motivations were
perfectly clear.

48:05.133 --> 48:08.125
And you understand that if I was
faced with the same choice again

48:08.219 --> 48:10.426
I would do exactly the same.

48:10.513 --> 48:12.595
l have no doubt whatsoever.

48:12.682 --> 48:16.766
I also know that Luxans are
not given to apologies.

48:23.735 --> 48:27.319
It's the device you've been
working on so diligently.

48:27.405 --> 48:29.145
What do you call it?

48:29.240 --> 48:32.949
It is a Shilquen, and it
is finally finished.

48:33.036 --> 48:34.321
And...

48:34.412 --> 48:36.573
what manner of weapon is it?

48:38.458 --> 48:40.949
It is not a weapon.

48:42.128 --> 48:49.375
(soft electronic tones playing)
