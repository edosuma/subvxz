00:01.151 --> 00:03.119
Previously on Fringe:

00:03.286 --> 00:06.744
They're calling these the
Pattern, as if someone's experimenting...

00:06.923 --> 00:08.720
...only the whole world is their lab.

00:09.659 --> 00:12.594
- Anybody you need, you can have.
- His name's Walter Bishop.

00:12.762 --> 00:14.889
- My father.
- He worked out of Harvard.

00:15.065 --> 00:18.523
He was part of a classified
U.S. Army experimental program...

00:18.702 --> 00:21.603
...in an area called fringe science.

00:21.771 --> 00:24.331
You're saying
I can talk to John in a coma?

00:24.507 --> 00:26.532
You could access his memories.

00:39.422 --> 00:41.549
Joseph.

00:42.659 --> 00:44.684
Joe.

00:45.762 --> 00:47.787
You're gonna be late.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.655
Oh, look at yourself. Tuck in your shirt.

01:23.833 --> 01:27.030
Put a comb through your hair,
for God's sake.

01:27.203 --> 01:31.799
Dara's son, he always
takes care of his appearance.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.563
- Meager.
- It's "Meegar."

02:00.737 --> 02:02.568
Late again and making personal calls?

02:02.739 --> 02:04.707
- No, no, I'm...
- Who's this?

02:05.341 --> 02:06.774
- Nobody.
- She your girlfriend?

02:06.943 --> 02:09.377
- She came with the phone.
- You stalking this girl?

02:09.545 --> 02:10.945
No.

02:15.084 --> 02:18.645
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, come on.

02:19.055 --> 02:22.218
Unbelievable. Two in one week.
Your sweep's leaving, Meager.

02:23.159 --> 02:25.923
Get on it, or get another gig.

03:06.703 --> 03:08.170
Hi. How are you today?

03:08.338 --> 03:12.069
And we're still on for the regional
managers' meeting tomorrow at 4?

03:12.342 --> 03:13.832
Great.

03:14.711 --> 03:15.735
Yeah. Thank you.

03:16.980 --> 03:18.845
Okay, great.

03:19.215 --> 03:20.239
No problem.

03:21.484 --> 03:22.917
Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.

03:24.087 --> 03:26.282
Oh, I'm so sor...
I did not mean to interrupt.

03:26.656 --> 03:30.854
No problem. Don't you usually
have a little tablet thingy with you?

03:31.995 --> 03:34.520
Yeah. I usually do.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.961
Is there something else, or?

03:43.840 --> 03:46.832
- I used to be a Webelo.
- I don't...

03:47.010 --> 03:51.276
The Webelos, Cub Scouts?
Your Brownie patch.

03:51.447 --> 03:53.881
Oh, yeah.

03:54.050 --> 03:57.110
No, I actually found that online.

03:57.787 --> 04:01.120
It's kitschy, right? I was gonna
put it on one of my jackets.

04:01.291 --> 04:03.555
Oh, that's...

04:03.760 --> 04:06.058
Oh, that's... Yeah, that's cool.

04:06.262 --> 04:08.457
Hey, Bethany.
We still on for drinks tonight?

04:08.631 --> 04:11.532
Of course. But you better not
keep me out too late this time.

04:12.201 --> 04:13.668
We'll see.

04:16.572 --> 04:18.540
No, no, no.

04:18.708 --> 04:20.539
Please, don't do this to me.

04:20.709 --> 04:23.270
Come on. No. What happened?

04:23.446 --> 04:25.744
Damn it. Oh, my God.
Do not crash on me.

04:25.915 --> 04:27.678
This is not happening.

04:33.923 --> 04:37.222
Hold it. Hold it. Please, hold the elevator.

04:38.061 --> 04:40.222
I gotta find an IT guy. This is a disaster.

04:41.164 --> 04:42.995
Oh, you dropped your...

05:00.917 --> 05:02.817
- Are you okay?
- Get away from me.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.660
Oh, no.

05:53.002 --> 05:54.128
Bethany?

05:55.405 --> 05:57.134
Bethany?

06:18.461 --> 06:19.928
Stop it.

06:20.096 --> 06:23.031
Stop it. Stop doing that!

06:50.626 --> 06:52.287
Because you knew about John...

06:52.462 --> 06:55.829
...and you didn't say anything,
I trust you.

06:55.998 --> 06:59.161
At least, enough for me to not think
you're gonna think I'm crazy.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.303
No, of course not.

07:03.272 --> 07:05.502
I saw him last night.

07:06.309 --> 07:07.708
You saw John?

07:08.711 --> 07:10.679
In my kitchen.

07:13.382 --> 07:14.849
Hello, Liv.

07:16.152 --> 07:17.983
I grabbed my gun...

07:18.421 --> 07:20.355
...but he was gone.

07:23.693 --> 07:27.185
I know he wasn't there, obviously.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.722
I just...

07:29.899 --> 07:32.993
Let me see.
You fall in love with your partner...

07:33.169 --> 07:36.161
...who betrays you and your country.

07:36.339 --> 07:38.603
He dies in your arms,
shows up in your kitchen.

07:38.808 --> 07:41.208
And you wonder if that's
grounds to recuse yourself?

07:41.377 --> 07:44.744
- Okay, we can start with that.
- I say no.

07:44.914 --> 07:48.577
You exposed him. Bare minimum,
that makes you indispensable.

07:48.951 --> 07:50.612
You want my advice?

07:51.020 --> 07:54.217
Next time John shows up
for a nightcap...

07:55.324 --> 07:57.053
...give him one.
- I'm being serious.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.251
So am I. You think
that a few weeks pass...

07:59.428 --> 08:02.192
...and everything you went through
just goes away?

08:02.832 --> 08:04.766
Don't fight it.

08:05.134 --> 08:06.567
Don't beat yourself up.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.699
You know, you're good at that.

08:11.874 --> 08:13.933
That's a character flaw.

08:16.646 --> 08:18.614
It'll get easier.

08:33.395 --> 08:35.296
- She say what it was about?
- Olivia?

08:35.464 --> 08:38.058
- No, she'll tell us when she gets here.
- How are you?

08:38.234 --> 08:41.601
- Never been better.
- You look quite the opposite.

08:42.004 --> 08:44.632
Maybe that's because
I had trouble sleeping last night.

08:44.807 --> 08:46.741
Oh, I had trouble sleeping myself.

08:47.143 --> 08:51.375
I was thinking about that man.
The one who tortured you.

08:51.881 --> 08:55.476
Something about him. So familiar.

08:59.121 --> 09:02.784
Peter, when I was in St. Claire's...

09:02.959 --> 09:04.984
We don't have to talk. It's not important.

09:05.161 --> 09:06.651
But it is important.

09:07.163 --> 09:11.998
You cannot imagine
what it's like for a man like me...

09:12.168 --> 09:15.331
...to not have access to parts of his mind.

09:23.012 --> 09:25.446
You're doing fine, Walter.

09:30.052 --> 09:32.543
- Dr. Bishop. Peter.
- Ahem.

09:32.955 --> 09:35.480
Visiting hours.
Put on your best straitjacket.

09:36.058 --> 09:39.118
At approximately 10:17 this morning,
a massive power surge...

09:39.295 --> 09:42.230
...struck a downtown high-rise
in Worcester, Massachusetts.

09:42.431 --> 09:47.061
As a result, an elevator on the 26th floor
plummeted straight to the basement.

09:47.236 --> 09:50.000
- Eight passengers died.
- Did the cable snap?

09:50.172 --> 09:51.230
That's what's strange.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.568
The elevator didn't fall.
It drove itself into the ground.

09:54.744 --> 09:57.076
- That's not possible.
- Nine months ago...

09:57.246 --> 10:00.579
...a maglev train in Tokyo
plowed through a crowded station.

10:00.750 --> 10:04.811
Publicly, reported as human error.
In reality...

10:04.987 --> 10:07.217
...caused by a power surge
of unknown origin.

10:07.657 --> 10:10.524
Intelligence chatter speculated
it might be a demonstration...

10:10.693 --> 10:12.251
...of a new weapon technology.

10:12.461 --> 10:15.521
It's possible this morning's event
was another demonstration.

10:15.698 --> 10:19.600
To override the elevator's circuitry
would require a discharge...

10:19.769 --> 10:22.101
...of immense power and precision.

10:22.271 --> 10:24.865
I've made arrangements
for you at the building.

10:25.174 --> 10:28.974
We need to know what happened,
how it happened, and who's behind it.

10:36.519 --> 10:38.350
Peter Simmons, the building's engineer.

10:38.521 --> 10:42.116
Olivia Dunham, FBI. This is my team.
Peter Bishop and Dr. Walter Bishop.

10:42.291 --> 10:44.350
So you've been briefed
on what's happened?

10:44.527 --> 10:47.724
Elevator powered itself into the floor.
Never saw anything like it.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.229
- Shouldn't the brakes have come on?
- They did.

10:50.399 --> 10:54.267
The safeties clamped into the rails,
but for some reason, the motor kept going.

10:54.437 --> 10:56.803
Nearly melted the shoes,
which is technically...

10:56.972 --> 10:59.463
Impossible? Yeah, we've seen
a lot of that lately.

10:59.642 --> 11:02.270
- You know your elevators.
- MIT dropout.

11:02.511 --> 11:06.072
- Is there any security-camera footage?
- Nope, all the cameras fritzed.

11:06.248 --> 11:09.706
Hey, can you people move out of there?
FBI coming through.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.255
So how could an elevator drive itself?

11:16.425 --> 11:19.917
It's almost like another generator
came online, jacked into the system...

11:20.096 --> 11:23.429
...and overloaded it
with double or triple the voltage.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.909
Exit-wound burns.

11:41.050 --> 11:44.816
Subconjunctival hemorrhages.

11:46.088 --> 11:49.319
This woman displays
all the symptoms of a classic...

11:49.492 --> 11:52.086
- Thermoelectric trauma.
- What are you two saying?

11:52.328 --> 11:54.694
He's saying
all these people were electrocuted.

11:54.864 --> 11:56.491
Electrocuted?

11:56.866 --> 11:58.561
May I?

12:04.373 --> 12:07.467
It's lovely. Twenty-four-karat gold.

12:08.310 --> 12:12.770
Traces of nickel, possibly cobalt.

12:24.393 --> 12:27.226
- How are you doing that?
- This entire space is charged...

12:27.396 --> 12:31.457
...with electromagnetic energy,
far beyond that which occurs in nature.

12:31.634 --> 12:33.829
And there's still
residual magnetic energy...

12:34.003 --> 12:37.461
...from whatever
electrocuted these people.

12:38.607 --> 12:41.804
I need to examine
the victims' belongings...

12:41.977 --> 12:43.706
...and one of the bodies as well.

12:43.879 --> 12:47.542
- You may know how this happened?
- No, not yet.

12:47.716 --> 12:52.415
But I can tell you, every one
of the passengers in this elevator...

12:52.621 --> 12:54.714
...dead by the time they hit the ground.

12:58.828 --> 13:02.320
I have worked on a project
where I've seen this before.

13:02.498 --> 13:04.830
The government had asked me
if it was possible...

13:05.000 --> 13:08.868
...to make the human being
trackable by pigeons.

13:09.538 --> 13:14.566
Like homing pigeons?
What possible use could that serve?

13:14.743 --> 13:17.371
Well, I'm sure it had something to do
with the commies.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.411
It always did back then.

13:19.582 --> 13:22.415
Regardless, our theory
was that human beings...

13:22.585 --> 13:27.386
...are merely
highly complex electrical systems.

13:27.857 --> 13:29.347
Battery, please, Olivia.

13:29.525 --> 13:33.461
And the heart, the brain
driven by electrical impulses.

13:33.662 --> 13:37.291
Because everyone has
a unique electromagnetic signature...

13:37.466 --> 13:39.229
...which is like a fingerprint...

13:39.401 --> 13:42.234
...we theorized
that properly altered pigeons...

13:42.404 --> 13:44.964
...should be able to hone in
to that signature.

13:45.174 --> 13:48.268
- Like they know to fly south for winter?
- Precisely.

13:48.444 --> 13:50.708
But the human field was too weak...

13:50.880 --> 13:54.611
...so we tried to augment it, make it
strong enough for the birds to detect.

13:54.783 --> 13:57.308
- Did it work?
- Oh, yes.

13:57.486 --> 14:00.250
But the side effects negated our plans.

14:00.422 --> 14:04.051
There was one test subject, every time
she hiccupped, the lights would dim.

14:04.226 --> 14:07.559
So you're saying these people
could control electronic devices?

14:08.097 --> 14:09.962
No, not deliberately.

14:10.132 --> 14:13.568
But I did surmise that
it could be possible.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.838
- Oh.
- Did you just make that come back to life?

14:18.007 --> 14:22.307
No. Not in this particular instance.

14:22.478 --> 14:25.936
- But it does confirm my theory.
- What theory?

14:26.115 --> 14:28.413
- Didn't I say?
- No.

14:28.584 --> 14:31.280
Someone has pursued this idea.

14:31.453 --> 14:35.787
They have amplified
a person's electromagnetic field.

14:35.958 --> 14:39.621
In fact, it is the residual energy
from that person...

14:39.795 --> 14:41.854
...that is making this heart pump.

14:42.498 --> 14:44.864
And further, it is that person...

14:45.034 --> 14:47.969
...who is responsible for
the deaths in the elevator.

14:48.137 --> 14:51.300
So you don't think it was a weapon
that electrocuted those people?

14:51.640 --> 14:55.371
No. It was a human being.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.978
Accident occurred just after
10 a.m. here at the Herndon Building...

15:00.149 --> 15:03.448
...in downtown Worcester.
- Hey, Ron wanted to see you.

15:03.619 --> 15:07.055
- Names haven't yet been released,
dropped 26 stories to their deaths...

15:07.256 --> 15:10.384
...when the building's elevator system
failed catastrophically.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.689
What's wrong with you?

15:14.463 --> 15:15.760
You look sick.

15:27.209 --> 15:28.642
Excuse me, Mr. Boynton.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.212
- Where have you been?
- Excuse me?

15:37.219 --> 15:38.982
Do you remember last week?

15:39.154 --> 15:43.420
What I said to you? The words I used?
How sympathetic I was? What did I say?

15:43.592 --> 15:45.492
That you were watching my performance.

15:45.661 --> 15:50.030
I said to stay on the damn grid and stick
to the schedule, because the system...

15:50.199 --> 15:53.532
...depends on people like you being,
at the very least, reliable.

15:53.902 --> 15:55.529
I've...

15:55.704 --> 15:57.103
...had a really hard day.

15:57.306 --> 15:58.534
Guess what?

15:58.707 --> 16:00.538
Your day's fantastic compared to mine.

16:01.176 --> 16:02.939
No, it's not.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.369
- What's on your uniform?
- What?

16:05.547 --> 16:09.176
- What is that?
- I don't know. I'm not sure.

16:09.351 --> 16:13.515
I'll tell you what, I'll make it easy.
It's not your uniform anymore.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.356
- Go to the locker room.
- Wait.

16:15.524 --> 16:18.516
- Take it off and leave it there.
- No, please.

16:18.694 --> 16:21.424
- I take care of my mother.
- And I take care of my family.

16:21.697 --> 16:25.133
One of the ways I do that
is to employ smart, reliable, capable people.

16:25.334 --> 16:27.131
- You are none of those things.
- Please.

16:27.336 --> 16:29.770
You're fired. Go.

16:30.639 --> 16:32.072
- Mr. Boynton...
- Get out.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.436
I don't wanna see you
in this building anymore.

16:35.377 --> 16:37.538
Get the hell out of here!

16:45.721 --> 16:47.279
Oh, no.

16:47.723 --> 16:49.486
Get him out of there.

17:22.590 --> 17:24.115
Here.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.590
Thanks.

17:30.065 --> 17:33.865
- I thought you left hours ago.
- I could say the same about you.

17:34.069 --> 17:38.005
What are you reading?
New Distortion in Human Subjects.

17:38.173 --> 17:40.300
And what's all this for?

17:41.009 --> 17:44.342
I was trying to wrap my head
around an idea Walter had.

17:44.513 --> 17:47.778
He believes that it may be a person...

17:47.950 --> 17:50.646
...who is responsible
for the Herndon incident.

17:50.819 --> 17:54.016
Not a person
wielding some kind of device.

17:54.189 --> 17:56.817
A person who has developed
the ability to affect...

17:56.992 --> 18:00.155
...or maybe even control
electrical devices.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.162
I suppose the good doctor has a theory
how that's possible?

18:03.332 --> 18:06.358
He thinks this person
was altered in some way.

18:06.535 --> 18:09.129
Extensive procedures, chemical therapy.

18:12.374 --> 18:13.864
What?

18:18.680 --> 18:21.171
In the course of investigating
other Pattern cases...

18:21.350 --> 18:24.717
...we've come across a handful
of clinics. Off-the-grid operations...

18:24.887 --> 18:26.252
...that solicited clients...

18:26.421 --> 18:30.619
...by making the same kind of claims
you see advertised on TV at 3 a.m.

18:30.993 --> 18:34.827
Only they weren't actually providing
weight loss or hair growth.

18:35.831 --> 18:37.162
What were they really doing?

18:38.400 --> 18:40.732
Have you ever heard of a man
named Jacob Fischer?

18:41.770 --> 18:45.206
- No.
- A doctor of biotechnology...

18:45.374 --> 18:47.501
...wanted in four states
and three countries...

18:47.676 --> 18:50.076
...for illegal human experimentation.

18:50.245 --> 18:53.043
Surgical alterations,
radical hormone therapy...

18:53.215 --> 18:56.116
...using average citizens
as unwitting guinea pigs.

18:56.285 --> 19:00.085
One subject was pumped full of
stimulants. Kept awake for a solid year.

19:00.255 --> 19:03.156
Fed on a steady visual diet
of horrific images.

19:04.726 --> 19:08.218
I only bring it up
because if Dr. Bishop is right...

19:08.397 --> 19:11.525
...and there is a person
with these extraordinary capabilities...

19:11.700 --> 19:14.965
...it might very well be
that someone made him this way.

19:15.170 --> 19:17.695
I'd like to read the files on Dr. Fischer.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.069
I'll have them transferred
to your terminal.

19:23.779 --> 19:26.213
But it's not easy stuff to look at.

20:38.453 --> 20:39.977
Hello?

21:18.160 --> 21:19.821
Hey, Liv.

21:21.863 --> 21:24.229
It's okay. It's okay.

21:24.399 --> 21:26.162
It's just me.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.697
I know
this doesn't make any sense to you.

21:29.871 --> 21:34.069
Even if it did, you don't have any reason
to trust me, but I'm asking you to.

21:34.242 --> 21:36.403
We don't have much time.

21:36.912 --> 21:39.073
- I'm here to help.
- You tried to kill me.

21:39.247 --> 21:41.613
No. Liv...

21:43.385 --> 21:45.319
...I loved you.

21:46.421 --> 21:48.218
You know that.

21:48.757 --> 21:50.884
You know I loved you.

21:51.526 --> 21:53.926
I did. Always.

21:57.132 --> 21:59.123
I can prove it to you.

22:02.237 --> 22:06.936
But not here.
It's just not the way it works.

22:07.109 --> 22:09.942
You're on the right track.
I'm here to tell you that.

22:10.112 --> 22:13.343
You're looking for a person,
but Jacob Fischer is after him also.

22:13.515 --> 22:16.382
You need to get to him first,
before Fischer can use him.

22:24.059 --> 22:26.152
Use him for what?

22:28.630 --> 22:30.564
Use him for what?

22:32.100 --> 22:33.931
How do you know that?

22:35.670 --> 22:37.763
I will prove it, Liv...

22:37.939 --> 22:39.600
...that I love you.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.504
Always.

22:41.877 --> 22:46.007
But not just yet.
You're just gonna have to wait.

23:25.921 --> 23:28.219
There were weight sensors
in the elevator.

23:28.423 --> 23:30.823
So just before impact...

23:30.992 --> 23:34.951
...the car weighed 1440 pounds.

23:35.130 --> 23:38.964
1275 pounds.

23:39.134 --> 23:41.932
Leaving a discrepancy
of a hundred and 65 pounds.

23:42.104 --> 23:45.073
Meaning someone walked out
of there alive.

23:46.708 --> 23:49.472
Okay. So somebody got lucky.
So what?

23:50.679 --> 23:54.308
Walter's theoretical test subject,
I think, is real.

23:54.483 --> 23:57.247
- And this could be him.
- The problem with that scenario...

23:57.452 --> 24:00.979
...is that it doesn't make sense.
If he was in the elevator car...

24:01.156 --> 24:03.647
...he should've been electrocuted
like everyone else.

24:03.825 --> 24:07.158
- That's if the impact didn't kill him first.
- Not necessarily.

24:07.329 --> 24:09.991
If this person
is both the source and the conductor...

24:10.165 --> 24:13.692
...of a large amount of electrical current,
then it could induce a form...

24:13.869 --> 24:16.360
...of electrodynamic levitation.

24:17.405 --> 24:19.873
That's the technology
behind maglev trains.

24:20.041 --> 24:23.340
They essentially float
on an electromagnetic cushion.

24:23.612 --> 24:25.102
So he floated?

24:25.614 --> 24:28.276
Like my necklace in the elevator?

24:28.783 --> 24:30.842
No, but...

24:31.086 --> 24:32.986
...it is possible that he could have...

24:33.155 --> 24:36.921
...levitated long enough to escape
the brunt of the impact.

24:37.259 --> 24:38.783
That still doesn't make sense.

24:38.994 --> 24:43.431
If you can sabotage machines,
you wouldn't sabotage one you're in.

24:44.266 --> 24:46.461
Unless it was unintentional.

24:46.635 --> 24:48.364
An accident.

24:48.770 --> 24:51.898
Maybe whoever we're looking for
isn't in control of their abilities.

24:52.073 --> 24:54.098
They don't even know
what they're doing.

24:54.643 --> 24:57.806
We shouldn't look for big events.
We should look for small ones.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.508
Unintentional ones.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.383
Oh, come on. Damn it.

25:04.819 --> 25:06.946
Just a small discharge...

25:07.122 --> 25:10.717
...negligible compared to the voltage
coursing through that elevator.

25:10.892 --> 25:13.759
I say, we need to find
this person, and soon...

25:13.929 --> 25:16.955
...before he finds out
exactly what he's capable of.

25:19.401 --> 25:20.663
Wool socks.

25:20.835 --> 25:22.598
Charlie, thanks for waking up the team.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.602
Look, we got reports of anomalies...

25:24.773 --> 25:27.833
...clustered around parts
of Worcester and the Herndon building.

25:28.043 --> 25:31.274
Parking-garage gates, automatic doors,
a few CCTVs.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.607
We need more.
Enough to discern a pattern.

25:34.349 --> 25:38.080
You know, saying somebody is doing
all this, you do know that's crazy, right?

25:38.253 --> 25:41.188
If it weren't,
we wouldn't be looking for him.

25:48.630 --> 25:49.756
- Joseph.
- Mom.

25:49.931 --> 25:52.024
What time is it?

25:52.200 --> 25:55.101
- Where the hell have you been?
- Mom...

25:55.270 --> 25:58.296
...I think I made a big mistake.
- You? Surprise.

25:58.473 --> 26:00.668
Please, just listen to me.

26:00.842 --> 26:04.676
Please. A few months ago, I was reading
this magazine, and there was this ad...

26:04.846 --> 26:07.644
...in the back about tapping
into your hidden potential...

26:07.816 --> 26:10.944
...and I figured it couldn't hurt,
so I went down to this office.

26:11.119 --> 26:13.349
- They did some tests.
- Did you give them money?

26:13.521 --> 26:17.321
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- They put me under some hypnosis...

26:17.492 --> 26:19.824
...I don't know,
and they said they were gonna...

26:19.995 --> 26:23.021
...realign the electrical impulses
of my brain.

26:23.198 --> 26:25.598
- Make it mimic a more confident person.
- Oh!

26:25.800 --> 26:30.066
No, but they did something to me.
They changed me. I can't remember.

26:30.238 --> 26:32.229
Now all these things
have been happening.

26:32.407 --> 26:34.739
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

26:34.909 --> 26:38.037
- What if I'm dying?
- Stop it! Get ahold of your...

26:38.213 --> 26:39.544
Damn it, Mom!

26:40.915 --> 26:44.146
For once, please, please, help me.

26:47.389 --> 26:50.358
- Pills.
- Oh, my God. No, no, no. Please.

26:52.060 --> 26:53.652
Pills.

26:55.430 --> 26:58.558
Hello? Hello? Hello?

26:58.733 --> 27:00.223
Hello?

27:16.785 --> 27:18.548
Joseph Meegar?

27:20.722 --> 27:24.123
You don't have to be scared, Joseph.
We want to help you.

27:24.292 --> 27:29.195
- We're here to adjust your medication.
- You did this to me. What did you... Ahh!

27:45.714 --> 27:48.342
Looking for anything unusual.
Systems going off-line...

27:48.516 --> 27:51.349
...random power surges.
- Hey, I've got another incident.

27:51.519 --> 27:54.010
- Hold on.
- Bicoastal Parcel. Guy lost his hand...

27:54.189 --> 27:57.420
...in a conveyor malfunction.
- Bicoastal Parcel?

27:57.592 --> 27:59.025
Yeah.

27:59.728 --> 28:01.696
I gotta call you back.

28:03.231 --> 28:04.698
What?

28:07.001 --> 28:09.265
Herndon Building security sign-in sheet.

28:09.437 --> 28:11.371
"Bicoastal Parcel."

28:11.940 --> 28:14.033
"Joseph Meegar."

28:42.036 --> 28:45.631
She was found dead.
Pacemaker malfunction.

28:45.907 --> 28:47.898
Olivia thinks
they may have found our guy.

28:48.076 --> 28:51.910
Now we just have to find him.
Time of death was around 1:15 a.m.

28:52.080 --> 28:54.844
So God knows where he could be
by now.

28:55.049 --> 28:58.280
Ask her what's visible
in the event perimeter...

28:58.453 --> 29:00.182
...electronic, specifically.

29:00.355 --> 29:03.415
Walter wants to know what's
in the apartment. What kind of gadgets?

29:03.591 --> 29:05.991
- Specifically, electronics.
- Um...

29:06.294 --> 29:09.695
- Okay, there's a answering machine.
- An answering machine.

29:09.864 --> 29:12.128
- Telephone. Boom box.
- Telephone. Boom box.

29:12.300 --> 29:13.324
- Fan.
- Fan.

29:13.501 --> 29:17.460
Boom box. That's a device
for playing music, cassette tapes, yes?

29:17.639 --> 29:20.335
Yes, but now's not really the time...

29:20.508 --> 29:21.975
- Anything else?
- Television.

29:22.143 --> 29:23.974
- A television.
- Lamps.

29:24.145 --> 29:26.636
A lamp. Walter. Walter.

29:26.815 --> 29:28.806
Pay attention. We're doing this for you.

29:28.983 --> 29:31.315
Tell Olivia to come home.

29:31.686 --> 29:33.347
I know how to find him.

29:40.628 --> 29:41.925
So, what is this?

29:43.298 --> 29:45.459
This is the sort of work I was born for.

29:45.633 --> 29:47.692
You were hoping for something
more specific?

29:47.869 --> 29:52.135
Everyone has
a unique magnetic fingerprint.

29:52.307 --> 29:53.831
I said that, yes?

29:54.008 --> 29:57.000
But it's limited, barely traceable...

29:57.178 --> 29:58.645
...except in people like Mr...

29:58.813 --> 30:00.906
- What was his name?
- Meegar.

30:01.115 --> 30:04.983
Meegar. But since Mr. Meegar
has been enhanced...

30:05.153 --> 30:08.611
...he'll give off a stronger signal
than your average Joe.

30:08.790 --> 30:10.917
What's that got to do
with the cassette tape?

30:11.125 --> 30:14.652
Cassette tape is as simple as it gets.
Once exposed to a magnetic field...

30:14.829 --> 30:16.854
...it remains permanently magnetized.

30:17.699 --> 30:23.365
Given the strength of Mr. Meegar's
electromagnetic signature...

30:23.538 --> 30:25.836
...plus his proximity to the tape...

30:26.007 --> 30:28.066
...I have little doubt that
that cassette...

30:28.243 --> 30:32.509
...has been imprinted
with Meegar's electrical signature.

30:32.680 --> 30:36.377
It's kind of like when a film camera
double exposes a picture.

30:36.885 --> 30:41.219
Let me just take out the music
and see what we have left.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.429
Look, look, look. There it is.

30:52.233 --> 30:55.100
That's him. That's Mr...

30:55.270 --> 30:56.965
Meegar.

30:57.171 --> 31:00.902
Yes. Now to find Meegar.

31:01.209 --> 31:03.074
- How?
- Birds.

31:03.444 --> 31:05.605
- Wait, you mean that pigeon thing?
- Mm-hm.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.044
You believe we can find him
using pigeons?

31:08.216 --> 31:10.081
I think it's possible.

31:10.251 --> 31:13.414
As I've said, I can program
carrier pigeons...

31:13.588 --> 31:16.113
...to track
a strong electromagnetic field.

31:16.424 --> 31:17.755
We have his signature.

31:19.427 --> 31:22.692
- Now all we need are birds.
- I wish you told me earlier...

31:22.864 --> 31:25.128
...because then I could have been
working on it.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.632
- So how many?
- Not many. Two dozen.

31:28.403 --> 31:30.894
Two dozen? Great.

31:46.955 --> 31:51.119
- Wait, where am I?
- Tell Fischer he woke up.

31:53.861 --> 31:56.523
What is this place?

31:58.800 --> 32:00.097
What are you doing?

32:00.268 --> 32:02.031
What are you...? No, no, no.

32:02.236 --> 32:05.433
Wait, wait. No, no.
Please, please, please.

32:07.609 --> 32:11.045
- You ready?
- Yes, ideal.

32:11.245 --> 32:13.839
You're not gonna accidentally fry
one of those pigeons?

32:14.015 --> 32:15.607
Stranger things have happened.

32:15.984 --> 32:18.111
- It's his motto.
- As I said...

32:18.286 --> 32:21.619
...pigeons contain traces of magnetite
in their beaks...

32:21.789 --> 32:25.987
...like hundreds of tiny compass needles.

32:26.394 --> 32:30.956
The tesla coils will create
an artificial electromagnetic field...

32:31.132 --> 32:36.468
...which I have already matched
with Mr. Whatever's unique signature...

32:36.638 --> 32:39.505
...and we'll now imprint onto the pigeon.

32:39.674 --> 32:43.075
So we set all of these birds free,
and they...?

32:43.277 --> 32:45.336
Fly to Joseph Meegar.

32:46.347 --> 32:48.212
Me too. I'll believe it when I see it.

32:48.383 --> 32:51.648
Step back. Work to be done.

33:03.297 --> 33:05.162
- GPS chips ready?
- Yep.

33:05.333 --> 33:07.597
So we're putting GPS chips
on carrier pigeons...

33:07.802 --> 33:10.862
...to find a man
who can control electricity?

33:11.205 --> 33:13.230
I have you to thank for that, don't I?

33:13.408 --> 33:15.740
Yeah. That's me.

33:23.818 --> 33:25.308
Liv.

33:35.196 --> 33:36.857
No.

33:44.839 --> 33:47.535
- You listened.
- You're not real.

33:47.709 --> 33:51.645
- The last time we spoke, you listened.
- You stay the hell away from me.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.908
Liv.

34:15.002 --> 34:20.406
I didn't betray you.
You know that. In your heart.

34:21.775 --> 34:23.902
You know I wasn't the one.

34:27.782 --> 34:31.878
Hey. I think this bird thing
might actually work.

34:34.889 --> 34:36.014
You okay?

34:37.525 --> 34:39.083
Yeah.

34:49.536 --> 34:51.197
Hey, Charlie.

34:51.739 --> 34:53.672
Oh, thanks.

34:55.176 --> 34:58.168
- Did I miss anything?
- I think the show's about to start.

34:58.346 --> 35:01.179
I know we've only been together
for a short time...

35:01.349 --> 35:03.180
...but I think I'm going to miss them.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.376
Such majestic creatures.

35:05.553 --> 35:08.954
They're rats with wings.
You'll get over it.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.687
All right. GPS is active.

35:14.028 --> 35:16.929
Excellent. Then we're ready.

35:18.666 --> 35:20.930
Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.

35:23.871 --> 35:24.929
Start it up, Adam.

35:34.582 --> 35:36.174
Come on, come on.

35:51.098 --> 35:52.622
Are you sure this is gonna work?

35:53.067 --> 35:54.500
Of course not.

36:02.844 --> 36:04.311
Seriously, if this works...

36:04.478 --> 36:07.208
You're gonna have
some more faith in your father?

36:07.448 --> 36:08.813
No.

36:11.219 --> 36:14.655
- So, what do we do now?
- We gotta tie the GPS to the mainframe.

36:15.857 --> 36:17.586
Ingenious.

36:20.728 --> 36:22.923
And we're in.

36:23.464 --> 36:25.762
And there are the birds.

36:30.171 --> 36:32.298
- I don't see them.
- Yeah, we lost the birds.

36:32.473 --> 36:35.271
They're going northwest
towards Mill Street.

36:35.443 --> 36:38.173
- We're approaching Mill now.
- Make a left.

36:38.346 --> 36:40.007
Take a left.

36:44.752 --> 36:45.980
I see them.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.220
All right, we got them. I see them.

36:48.389 --> 36:50.789
Aren't you glad you got the car washed?

36:54.762 --> 36:57.731
- What is that?
- It is unfair.

36:57.899 --> 36:59.958
And I appreciate that.

37:00.134 --> 37:05.162
The position you find yourself in now
must be so surreal for you.

37:05.339 --> 37:07.500
Oh, my God, what did you do to me?
My head...

37:07.675 --> 37:08.835
...hurts so much.

37:09.010 --> 37:11.535
Those had to be subdermal.
They can be removed later.

37:13.514 --> 37:15.709
What am I doing here?

37:15.883 --> 37:17.475
No, no, no.

37:18.686 --> 37:22.850
You don't realize what you are.

37:23.024 --> 37:24.218
I'm scared.

37:25.426 --> 37:28.224
- Okay?
- You wanted to be confident.

37:28.396 --> 37:29.727
That's why you came to us.

37:29.897 --> 37:33.060
No, I don't want to be confident.
I don't need to be confident.

37:33.234 --> 37:35.930
- But you are now.
- I just want my life back!

37:36.103 --> 37:38.571
I just want to go back
to how it was, please.

37:38.739 --> 37:42.106
Look what science
has made you, Joseph.

37:42.310 --> 37:46.610
- You are special.
- No.

37:49.417 --> 37:52.545
- Make a right on Tempest.
- Take your next right.

38:00.261 --> 38:01.922
All right, I think they've stopped.

38:02.096 --> 38:05.725
- There.
- All right, I got them. I see them.

38:05.900 --> 38:08.266
Okay, we're heading there now.

38:08.769 --> 38:11.602
Then our work is done. Good luck.

38:24.952 --> 38:27.887
Hey. You stay here.

38:28.055 --> 38:30.148
Whatever you say, boss.

38:31.625 --> 38:34.560
- I'm not gonna ask.
- Good.

38:36.464 --> 38:39.262
- What is it?
- Visitors, front entrance.

38:40.935 --> 38:44.268
Take him out through the back.
Wait at the depot. You'll be contacted.

38:44.438 --> 38:46.668
- What about you?
- He's the priority.

38:58.085 --> 38:59.109
No movement.

38:59.987 --> 39:01.750
Stand back.

39:13.334 --> 39:14.858
Where are you taking me?

39:15.036 --> 39:17.470
Get in. Get in the car.

39:37.024 --> 39:38.855
Get those hands up.

39:41.195 --> 39:44.426
I said get your hands in the air.

39:45.299 --> 39:46.561
Joseph Meegar.

39:49.637 --> 39:51.366
Where is he?

39:51.672 --> 39:53.230
I'm sorry, who?

39:53.741 --> 39:56.141
Take upstairs. We'll go around.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.552
Freeze!

40:10.991 --> 40:12.686
Stop!

40:14.161 --> 40:15.890
Joseph!

40:49.096 --> 40:50.791
Stop!

41:10.151 --> 41:12.517
They're gonna keep him
heavily sedated a while.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.484
Don't want him pulling
his whole electro-man thing.

41:18.759 --> 41:20.351
Mr. Meegar?

41:20.528 --> 41:22.655
Miss, no one will tell me where I'm going.

41:23.297 --> 41:26.425
To the hospital.
They're going to perform some exams.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.864
Check to see that your head's okay.

41:29.036 --> 41:31.527
Then I'm gonna have
some questions for you.

41:31.739 --> 41:35.004
I wanna go home.
I didn't wanna hurt anybody.

41:35.176 --> 41:38.168
- We're going to help you.
- That's what they said.

41:38.779 --> 41:41.304
Please. I wanna go home.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.944
I'm afraid we can't let you do that.

41:58.365 --> 42:01.266
That one can go out the back,
thank you, my dear.

42:01.969 --> 42:03.061
What's my name?

42:06.907 --> 42:08.397
Starts with A, yes?

42:09.210 --> 42:11.303
- Astrid.
- Yeah.

42:11.478 --> 42:13.275
I knew it.

42:14.415 --> 42:16.315
Ah, Olivia.

42:17.151 --> 42:20.052
Peter told me to tell you,
if I saw you...

42:20.221 --> 42:23.190
...that he was returning the pigeons.
- Walter.

42:23.357 --> 42:24.688
What's?

42:25.559 --> 42:27.789
It's milk. From Gene.

42:27.962 --> 42:29.725
- Do you want some?
- I'll pass.

42:29.897 --> 42:31.558
- Are you certain?
- Mm-hm.

42:33.033 --> 42:36.491
The color in your face,
you're looking a little pallid.

42:37.204 --> 42:38.933
Are you feeling well?

42:39.106 --> 42:40.698
Fine.

42:41.508 --> 42:43.203
I'm a little tired, that's all.

42:43.544 --> 42:46.536
Well, I don't yet know you well enough...

42:46.714 --> 42:49.706
...to ask this...

42:51.385 --> 42:54.183
...but you haven't
seemed yourself lately.

42:56.590 --> 42:58.581
I haven't been sleeping very well.

43:03.063 --> 43:04.724
I've been...

43:08.902 --> 43:10.460
Nothing.

43:13.407 --> 43:14.431
I'll see you tomorrow.

43:15.609 --> 43:17.907
Have you been seeing him?

43:18.245 --> 43:20.839
Your friend, John Scott.

43:24.918 --> 43:26.909
I'm not surprised.

43:27.087 --> 43:29.078
There is a reason.

43:30.457 --> 43:32.789
I've been having hallucinations.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.884
No.

43:35.396 --> 43:38.092
Not hallucinations.

43:44.438 --> 43:46.065
Walter?

43:48.609 --> 43:52.306
- What's happening?
- I can't be sure.

43:52.780 --> 43:55.146
The brain is a mystery.

43:56.283 --> 44:00.379
But I believe
when you were in the tank...

44:01.455 --> 44:03.446
...John Scott...

44:05.759 --> 44:10.253
Part of his consciousness
crossed over into yours.

44:10.431 --> 44:12.626
And it's still there.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.961
His memories...

44:15.536 --> 44:18.130
...experiences, thoughts.

44:18.639 --> 44:20.300
You understand me, yes?

44:22.910 --> 44:25.174
These aren't memories.

44:26.613 --> 44:28.547
He appears.

44:28.716 --> 44:30.809
Right in front of me. He talks to me.

44:31.285 --> 44:33.515
Yes, he would.

44:33.687 --> 44:36.212
Like a waking dream.

44:36.824 --> 44:39.622
Because he doesn't belong there.

44:40.361 --> 44:44.491
There's only room for one voice
in your head, not two.

44:44.832 --> 44:47.426
This is your brain's way of working it out.

44:47.601 --> 44:50.570
Your mind is expelling him.

44:50.738 --> 44:53.036
Exorcising his thoughts.

44:54.241 --> 44:56.835
He'll go away.
Is that what you're saying?

45:00.214 --> 45:02.045
I don't know.

45:03.016 --> 45:05.143
Do you really want him to?

46:42.816 --> 46:46.013
Our team is still cataloging
all the files you found in the cellar.

46:46.186 --> 46:49.155
Apparently, John Scott
was conducting his own investigations.

46:49.323 --> 46:52.759
Do the files give any indication
of who he might have been working for?

46:52.926 --> 46:54.917
Not that we can see.

46:55.195 --> 46:57.857
But it appears many of the cases
were Pattern-related.

46:58.198 --> 46:59.563
He knew about the Pattern?

47:00.601 --> 47:03.297
He also knew about
our friend Dr. Fischer.

47:03.470 --> 47:06.098
In fact, he knew quite a bit more
than we did.

47:06.273 --> 47:08.264
Including seven other potential Josephs...

47:08.442 --> 47:10.672
...that Fischer was subjecting
to treatments.

47:10.844 --> 47:13.506
Fortunately, none of them
had activated yet.

47:13.680 --> 47:16.171
We were able to locate all seven.

47:16.350 --> 47:18.511
Medical services is examining them now.

47:18.685 --> 47:21.381
But they appear to be fine, thanks to you.

47:21.955 --> 47:25.152
Fischer's still refusing to cooperate,
but six weeks in solitary...

47:25.325 --> 47:28.294
...might change his mind.
- I hope you're right about that.

47:28.462 --> 47:30.862
And there was also something else.

47:34.334 --> 47:36.393
John Scott's personal effects.

47:39.106 --> 47:42.007
It would seem some of them
were intended for you.

48:32.259 --> 48:34.284
I will prove it, Liv.

48:34.461 --> 48:36.190
That I love you.

48:36.863 --> 48:38.592
Always.
