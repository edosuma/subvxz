02:21.981 --> 02:23.748
Put some heat on that one.

02:23.750 --> 02:26.184
Yeah, I guess
I missed my chance to go pro.

02:28.020 --> 02:30.287
Oh!

02:30.289 --> 02:31.923
Tell you what.

02:31.925 --> 02:33.625
Right now, you could walk away

02:33.627 --> 02:36.026
with a prize
from the second level,

02:36.028 --> 02:39.297
or you could keep going for
a prize from the third level.

02:39.299 --> 02:41.166
Okay.
What do you think, Addy?

02:41.168 --> 02:43.969
Should we stop or keep going?

02:46.006 --> 02:49.006
Don't look at me.
It's your birthday.

02:49.008 --> 02:51.008
I want number 11.

02:51.010 --> 02:52.977
- Yeah?
- That one?

02:52.979 --> 02:54.679
- Yeah.
- All right.

02:54.681 --> 02:56.317
Uh, yeah, uh, that one.

02:58.384 --> 03:00.186
- Thanks, man.
- Of course.

03:04.091 --> 03:05.756
Yeah.

03:05.758 --> 03:08.760
That shirt better not
give her nightmares.

03:08.762 --> 03:11.996
In trouble for winning
my daughter a T-shirt.

03:11.998 --> 03:13.931
That's a new one.

03:13.933 --> 03:16.701
She was terrified
when it came on TV.

03:16.703 --> 03:18.370
You'd know that
if you were around, right?

03:18.372 --> 03:20.704
Who let her watch it?

03:23.943 --> 03:25.744
You know...

03:25.746 --> 03:27.745
you know, they're filming
something by the carousel.

03:27.747 --> 03:29.780
You should see if
they're looking for extras.

03:29.782 --> 03:31.382
Uh... I need another beer.

03:38.025 --> 03:40.225
I can't have a beer now?

03:40.227 --> 03:43.794
Hey. How about the Big Dipper?

03:43.796 --> 03:45.964
Addy, you want to try it?

03:45.966 --> 03:48.198
Russel, you know she's
not big enough to do that.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.300
And I sure as hell
am not doing it, so...

03:54.341 --> 03:56.407
Whac-A-Mole!

03:56.409 --> 03:58.410
Yeah, Whac-A-Mole, guy.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.911
- That's what I'm talking about.
- How many tickets?

04:00.913 --> 04:03.982
- Two tickets.
- Two tickets!

04:03.984 --> 04:05.449
Two tickets!

04:05.451 --> 04:07.452
Hey, Addy,
come to the bathroom.

04:07.454 --> 04:09.953
I don't have to go.

04:14.093 --> 04:16.360
Russel?

04:16.362 --> 04:19.430
Russel! Can you watch
your daughter, please?

04:19.432 --> 04:21.168
I'm watching.

04:23.103 --> 04:25.704
Baby, stay close, okay?

04:37.216 --> 04:38.916
- Glen.
- What?

04:38.918 --> 04:41.051
- Stop it.
- I'm not doing anything.

04:41.053 --> 04:42.420
You keep doing scissors.

04:42.422 --> 04:44.022
Ah, I'm just cruising.

04:44.024 --> 04:46.791
Come on.

04:46.793 --> 04:48.358
Um, what?

04:48.360 --> 04:50.161
- This is ridiculous.
- It's too rad.

04:50.163 --> 04:51.829
Two knots. Come on, now.

04:51.831 --> 04:53.163
What?

04:53.165 --> 04:56.134
- This is... this is impossible.
- Oh, my God.

05:54.961 --> 05:57.230
Don't do it. Don't do it.

06:08.908 --> 06:12.142
<i>These, the earth and water,</i>

06:12.144 --> 06:15.980
<i>he divided into places
from which life could spring.</i>

06:15.982 --> 06:18.149
<i>The mountains and the valleys</i>

06:18.151 --> 06:22.252
<i>and the waters
were all where they should be.</i>

06:24.124 --> 06:27.457
<i>Then Sotuknang went to Taiowa
and said,</i>

06:27.459 --> 06:30.161
<i>"I want you to see
what I have done.</i>

06:30.163 --> 06:32.029
<i>And I have done well."</i>

06:32.031 --> 06:34.598
<i>And Taiowa looked and said,</i>

06:34.600 --> 06:36.500
<i>"It is very good.</i>

06:36.502 --> 06:39.269
<i>"But you are not done with it.</i>

06:39.271 --> 06:42.373
<i>"Now you must create life
of all kinds</i>

06:42.375 --> 06:45.512
<i>and set it in motion
according to my plan."</i>

06:51.218 --> 06:52.983
<i>...and went
into the endless space</i>

06:52.985 --> 06:55.385
<i>and gathered substance
to create his helper,</i>

06:55.387 --> 06:57.454
<i>the Spider Woman.</i>

06:57.456 --> 07:01.091
<i>"Look all about you,
Spider Woman," said Sotuknang.</i>

07:01.093 --> 07:03.360
<i>"Here now is endless space,</i>

07:03.362 --> 07:06.264
<i>"but in the world,
there is no joyful movement.</i>

07:06.266 --> 07:07.598
<i>The world needs..."</i>

12:13.673 --> 12:15.339
We made it!

12:15.341 --> 12:17.307
- Why?! Why?!
- No, Dad!

12:17.309 --> 12:19.810
- 'Cause y'all sleep too much.
- All right.

12:19.812 --> 12:22.280
Come on. Let's go.

12:22.282 --> 12:24.549
Careful. Hey, hey, hey!

12:24.551 --> 12:26.349
- Ah, whatever.
- Bags in the house first.

12:26.351 --> 12:27.919
Look, look, look, look, look.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.786
- Ew.
- Come on.

12:29.788 --> 12:31.388
You're too old.

12:31.390 --> 12:33.623
- You know the drill.
- Don't judge me.

12:33.625 --> 12:35.759
Don't judge me.

12:35.761 --> 12:37.695
- Little dude.
- The Wi-Fi's not working.

12:37.697 --> 12:40.464
You don't need the Internet.
You got the Outernet.

12:40.466 --> 12:41.732
Good one.

12:41.734 --> 12:43.434
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

12:43.436 --> 12:44.801
Knock-knock.

12:44.803 --> 12:46.637
- Who's there?
- You.

12:46.639 --> 12:47.772
You who?

12:47.774 --> 12:49.272
Yoo-hoo.

12:49.274 --> 12:50.541
Open up the door.

12:51.910 --> 12:53.611
My God, what's wrong with you?

12:53.613 --> 12:55.646
- Can we get a dog?
- No, we can't.

12:55.648 --> 12:57.214
You should run
while you're here.

12:57.216 --> 12:58.348
Jason, eat something.

12:58.350 --> 12:59.816
- Something.
- What?

12:59.818 --> 13:01.551
- What's with all the attitude?
- For me.

13:01.553 --> 13:02.652
I'm sorry.

13:02.654 --> 13:04.488
Yay, track and field.

13:04.490 --> 13:06.824
Whoa. You don't want
to run anymore?

13:06.826 --> 13:08.526
You love track and field.

13:08.528 --> 13:11.395
- Well, what's the point?
- The Olympics.

13:11.397 --> 13:12.997
I'm not gonna make it
to the Olympics, guys.

13:12.999 --> 13:15.432
You could do anything
you set your mind to.

13:15.434 --> 13:16.700
Can I drive
while we're up here?

13:16.702 --> 13:18.236
- No.
- No.

13:18.238 --> 13:19.570
Well, that's what
I set my mind to.

13:19.572 --> 13:21.339
- You know...
- Where you going, Jason?

13:21.341 --> 13:22.672
- Jason?
- Well, Cara and Haley...

13:22.674 --> 13:23.907
Yeah, I'm gonna get something.

13:23.909 --> 13:25.443
You need to come
and finish your food.

13:25.445 --> 13:26.844
Cara and Haley drove
with parent supervision.

13:26.846 --> 13:28.579
Yeah, well,
you don't need to know

13:28.581 --> 13:30.781
how to drive when you're
an Olympic-caliber athlete.

13:30.783 --> 13:32.416
- Oh, my God.
- You run.

13:32.418 --> 13:34.785
- You run on the sand.
- Why?

13:34.787 --> 13:37.287
Because it's harder, okay?

13:37.289 --> 13:38.789
- No traction.
- Mm.

13:38.791 --> 13:40.858
Practice on the beach,
you get on dry land,

13:40.860 --> 13:41.925
you take off.

13:41.927 --> 13:43.526
We're going to the beach?

13:43.528 --> 13:45.463
Yeah. Well, later.

13:45.465 --> 13:47.265
Once we get settled.

13:47.267 --> 13:50.001
- What beach?
- Santa Cruz.

13:50.003 --> 13:52.335
Josh, Kitty and the girls
are gonna be there.

13:58.677 --> 14:00.310
What are you doing?

14:00.312 --> 14:01.579
It's a magic trick.

14:01.581 --> 14:03.546
I left it here last year.

14:03.548 --> 14:04.684
Okay. Let's see it.

14:11.057 --> 14:12.989
This thing's kind of bullshit.

14:12.991 --> 14:16.594
Hey. What, are we cursing
at the table now?

14:16.596 --> 14:18.329
When you point a finger
at someone else,

14:18.331 --> 14:19.700
you have three pointing
back at you.

14:22.835 --> 14:25.835
What is that supposed to mean?

14:25.837 --> 14:28.506
It's four fingers
pointing back at you.

14:28.508 --> 14:29.839
What are you talking...?

14:29.841 --> 14:31.574
Look. See?

14:31.576 --> 14:33.743
One's a thumb,
and it's not pointing at you.

14:33.745 --> 14:35.546
<i>So, what is it?</i>

14:36.783 --> 14:39.316
I think she has
post-traumatic stress disorder.

14:39.318 --> 14:41.685
She wasn't in 'Nam.

14:41.687 --> 14:44.789
Okay? She got lost.
For 15 minutes. That's...

14:44.791 --> 14:46.656
That can be very scary.

14:46.658 --> 14:48.492
No, you don't know
what happened to her.

14:48.494 --> 14:49.926
Anything could've
happened to her.

14:49.928 --> 14:53.730
Okay, so... so how-how do we
get her to talk?

14:53.732 --> 14:55.999
Look, I think
we need to encourage her

14:56.001 --> 14:58.868
to draw, to write, to dance.

14:58.870 --> 15:01.939
Anything to help her
tell us her story.

15:04.043 --> 15:06.312
I just want
my little girl back.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.850
It's gonna be okay.

15:21.760 --> 15:24.462
- Um...
- I'm sorry.

15:24.464 --> 15:27.765
- Is...
- I'm... I'm gonna...

15:27.767 --> 15:29.836
I need to have a smoke.

16:04.604 --> 16:07.637
I don't get
why we have a summer home

16:07.639 --> 16:09.507
by the beach

16:09.509 --> 16:10.807
and don't go to the beach.

16:10.809 --> 16:12.075
What about the beach
right here?

16:12.077 --> 16:13.978
- What beach?
- There's a beach right there.

16:13.980 --> 16:15.546
That is not a beach.

16:15.548 --> 16:17.147
That is a bay.
That is a shore.

16:17.149 --> 16:19.083
I'm talking about a real beach,

16:19.085 --> 16:21.518
with people and sand,
amusement park.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.720
There's, like...
It's crowded there.

16:23.722 --> 16:25.723
- Oh, come...
- And, like, there's weirdos

16:25.725 --> 16:29.026
at that beach and...
I-I'm not going to that beach.

16:29.028 --> 16:31.462
- We're not going.
- Okay.

16:31.464 --> 16:33.464
I guess I'll just cancel, then.

16:33.466 --> 16:35.098
Okay.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.700
It just sucks, is all.

16:37.702 --> 16:39.804
I mean...

16:39.806 --> 16:42.506
I know Jason really was
looking forward to it.

16:42.508 --> 16:44.041
This is the first summer

16:44.043 --> 16:46.009
we've been back here
since Grandma died.

16:46.011 --> 16:48.945
I know it's been
pretty hard on him.

16:53.152 --> 16:55.084
We leave before dark.

16:55.086 --> 16:56.554
Yeah.

16:56.556 --> 16:57.854
Yes. Yes.

16:57.856 --> 16:59.656
It's gonna be great.

16:59.658 --> 17:01.658
- And you're gonna enjoy it.
- Mm-hmm.

17:01.660 --> 17:02.892
Mm-hmm.

17:02.894 --> 17:04.127
Mm-hmm.

17:04.128 --> 17:05.996
Are you really not
gonna kiss me?

17:05.998 --> 17:07.030
Mm-mm.

17:07.031 --> 17:10.200
You're not gonna kiss me?

17:10.202 --> 17:13.470
Hmm? Mm...

17:18.009 --> 17:20.076
Where's your brother?

17:20.078 --> 17:21.878
Your brother... where is he?

17:21.881 --> 17:23.881
I don't know.

17:23.883 --> 17:25.519
Really?

17:28.086 --> 17:29.756
Jason?

17:40.700 --> 17:42.866
Jason?

19:01.247 --> 19:04.748
Baby, that's why
you can't play in here.

19:04.750 --> 19:07.884
- Didn't this happen last year?
- Zora, please.

19:18.163 --> 19:21.364
Yeah!

19:21.366 --> 19:24.334
That's right.
What do you think?!

19:24.336 --> 19:27.770
Daddy is home, baby!

19:29.342 --> 19:31.342
Craw Daddy!

19:33.378 --> 19:36.145
- He's kidding, right?
- He is not kidding.

19:36.147 --> 19:38.649
Got a cassette player
and everything.

19:38.651 --> 19:40.617
Leather seats!

19:40.619 --> 19:42.353
Glove compartment!

19:42.355 --> 19:45.889
- Wow.
- That's right.

19:45.891 --> 19:48.792
It's even got
one of these, baby!

19:51.830 --> 19:55.301
Oh, I got it, I got it.
Guy taught me how to do this.

19:59.805 --> 20:02.909
It veers a little to the left,
so you got to hold on to it.

20:06.679 --> 20:09.013
Least I got it really cheap.

20:09.015 --> 20:11.347
- Will we all fit, though?
- You know what?

20:11.349 --> 20:13.350
Y'all are spoiled.

20:19.424 --> 20:21.961
Spoiled.

20:32.070 --> 20:34.337
Did you know that there's
fluoride in the water

20:34.339 --> 20:36.643
that the government uses
to control our minds?

20:41.413 --> 20:44.217
I forgot. Nobody cares about
the end of the world.

20:49.387 --> 20:51.822
Maybe you could just tell us
what's supposed to happen,

20:51.824 --> 20:53.757
and then we can picture it.

20:53.759 --> 20:56.026
Maybe you can
kiss my anus, Zora.

20:56.028 --> 20:58.828
- Ew!
- Whoa, whoa! - What?

20:58.830 --> 20:59.962
"Anus" isn't a cuss word.

20:59.964 --> 21:01.398
Why are we even talking
about anuses?

21:01.400 --> 21:03.433
- Why would you say that?
- I would have

21:03.435 --> 21:06.870
actually preferred you use
a curse word in this case.

21:06.872 --> 21:09.038
Mom, I can see you laughing.

21:09.040 --> 21:11.842
- I am not laughing.
- Where'd you even learn that?

21:11.844 --> 21:14.077
Okay, we don't always
have to be talking.

21:22.788 --> 21:24.388

21:40.940 --> 21:43.273

- It's not about drugs.

21:43.275 --> 21:45.109
It's a dope song.
Don't do drugs.

21:47.179 --> 21:49.278
- Jason, come on.
- Hmm?

21:49.280 --> 21:51.981
Get in rhythm.

21:54.053 --> 21:55.853
There you go. There you go.

22:10.001 --> 22:12.268
Oh, yeah.

22:12.270 --> 22:16.073
Welcome to Santa Cruz.

22:17.910 --> 22:20.110
Huh?

22:28.119 --> 22:30.187
Santa Cruz!

22:30.189 --> 22:32.122
Santa Cruz!

22:32.124 --> 22:34.958
- Santa Cruz!
- Okay, we get it!

22:34.960 --> 22:38.428
Santa Cruz! Santa Cruz!

22:38.430 --> 22:40.296
Santa Cruz!

22:40.298 --> 22:41.931
- She did...
- Five minutes.

22:41.933 --> 22:43.299
- You can't even talk.
- Look, I don't want to

22:43.301 --> 22:45.067
- talk about who can't talk.
- Russ...

22:45.069 --> 22:46.503
- What's gonna happen?
- If something happened to her...

22:46.505 --> 22:48.538
What's gonna happen,
okay? She left!

22:53.345 --> 22:55.478
Oh, my God.

22:55.480 --> 22:58.215
- Don't look. Don't look.
- Is he dead?

22:58.217 --> 23:00.083
You got to be kidding me.

23:48.334 --> 23:51.133
- Hey.
- Hey! What's up? - Hey.

23:51.135 --> 23:53.437
Thought you guys said 2:30.
Where's the efficiency, man?

23:53.439 --> 23:56.073
- Us Wilsons, you know, we take our time.
- Hey.

23:56.075 --> 23:58.174
- Hey. Look at you.
- Oh, my God, look at you.

23:58.176 --> 23:59.642
- Yes.
- Welcome to paradise.

23:59.644 --> 24:01.478
- Of course, man. - Hey.
- You look so pretty!

24:01.480 --> 24:02.513
- Hi. How are you?
- Thank you.

24:02.515 --> 24:03.613
Oh, the girls are gonna be
so happy to see you.

24:03.615 --> 24:05.915
Uh, what do you want?
I can get some beer for you.

24:05.917 --> 24:07.084
- Becca! Lindsey! Look who's here!
- No.

24:07.086 --> 24:08.317
- No?
- The answer is no.

24:08.319 --> 24:09.620
- Please.
- He's old enough.

24:09.622 --> 24:11.153
- In a couple more years.
- Don't hawk her.

24:11.155 --> 24:13.523
- All right, all right.
- Hi.

24:13.525 --> 24:15.292
- No shit. You got the boat?
- Yep, I got the boat.

24:15.294 --> 24:16.459
- Good for you, dude.
- Boom.

24:16.461 --> 24:18.061
That's fucking awesome.
What'd you get?

24:18.063 --> 24:20.029
- A dinghy? You get, like...
- Oh, shut up.

24:20.031 --> 24:21.965
You got to make sure
you have the essentials.

24:21.967 --> 24:23.600
- You got the life preservers?
- Got that.

24:23.602 --> 24:25.334
- You got a fire extinguisher?
- Got that.

24:25.336 --> 24:28.205
Do you have a flare gun?

24:28.207 --> 24:31.208
I knew you'd fucking forget the flare gun.

24:31.210 --> 24:33.309
We got to get out there
and do a double excursion.

24:33.311 --> 24:35.679
We're right across the bay
from you guys, for fuck's sake.

24:35.681 --> 24:37.381
Sure you don't want
anything to drink?

24:37.383 --> 24:39.949
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- This rosé is delicious.

24:39.951 --> 24:43.056
Mm-hmm. I'm sure, yeah.

24:44.589 --> 24:46.623
Did you guys have
a good summer so far?

24:46.625 --> 24:48.458
Yeah, it's been great.

24:48.460 --> 24:51.228
No, a little bit small,
but a classic design, you know?

24:51.230 --> 24:52.395
You good?

24:52.397 --> 24:54.463
Yeah.

24:54.465 --> 24:55.901
What?

24:57.001 --> 24:59.268
I have a hard time just...

24:59.270 --> 25:01.337
you know, talking.

25:01.339 --> 25:03.105
Oh, I get that.

25:03.107 --> 25:05.441
Yeah, no, I totally get that.

25:05.443 --> 25:07.544
You guys, uh, want something?

25:07.546 --> 25:09.278
Got a full bar here.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.547
No. All good. Water.

25:11.549 --> 25:13.150
You want thirds, huh?

25:13.152 --> 25:15.651
- Thank you.
- Okay.

25:15.653 --> 25:18.020
I'm gonna get my wife
her medicine.

25:18.022 --> 25:19.488
That's beautiful, isn't it?

25:19.490 --> 25:20.724
Here you go.

25:20.726 --> 25:22.159
- Just... - Mm, yeah.
- Ah, ah.

25:22.161 --> 25:24.260
What do we say?

25:24.262 --> 25:25.461
I hate you?

25:25.463 --> 25:26.697
- That works.
- Yeah?

25:26.699 --> 25:29.333
- Yeah.
- Good.

25:29.335 --> 25:31.468
Never stops.

25:31.470 --> 25:33.703
I think about
murdering him sometimes.

25:33.705 --> 25:36.305
- So nothing's changed, huh?
- Nope.

25:36.307 --> 25:40.379
Oh, actually,
a little something has changed.

25:42.114 --> 25:44.347
Oh, my God.

25:44.349 --> 25:46.182
Did you get something done?

25:46.184 --> 25:48.084
Just, like, an itsy-bitsy,
little... a little thing.

25:48.086 --> 25:50.386
- Oh, fuck off.
- Yeah.

25:50.388 --> 25:52.189
Well, you look just like
you did last year.

25:52.191 --> 25:53.457
Aw, thank you.

25:53.459 --> 25:55.092
I mean, that's the idea,
you know.

25:55.094 --> 25:57.526
- Just, like, a little bit can go a long way.
- Mm.

25:57.528 --> 26:00.630
Not that you need
anything, whore.

26:11.509 --> 26:13.509
- Oh, man.
- Oops.

26:13.511 --> 26:15.411
What was it?

26:15.413 --> 26:18.547
Just a stupid tunnel.
That's all.

26:18.549 --> 26:21.287
Ugh.
Beach toys are such baby shit.

26:29.028 --> 26:31.394
Your brother's so weird.

26:31.396 --> 26:33.532
He just has
a hard time focusing.

26:35.467 --> 26:38.035
Are you going in the water?

26:38.037 --> 26:40.202
- No.
- Why not?

26:40.204 --> 26:41.604
Yeah, why not?

26:41.606 --> 26:43.774
- Hey, where are you going?
- To the bathroom.

26:43.776 --> 26:46.142
Why don't you pee in the ocean?

26:46.144 --> 26:48.045
Jinx. Double jinx.

26:48.047 --> 26:49.712
Triple jinx. Blackout.

26:49.714 --> 26:52.282
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

26:52.284 --> 26:54.354
Do you ever wish
you kept dancing?

26:56.154 --> 26:58.154
Sometimes, yeah.

26:58.156 --> 27:00.657
'Cause you were, like,
you were really good, right?

27:00.659 --> 27:02.459
Yeah, well...

27:02.461 --> 27:04.193
I peaked at 14.

27:04.195 --> 27:05.728
Oh, I mean, didn't we all?

27:17.643 --> 27:19.609
I think I could have been
a movie star

27:19.611 --> 27:23.313
if the girls hadn't been born
at exactly the wrong time.

27:23.315 --> 27:25.782
I went to Stella Adler,

27:25.784 --> 27:29.286
and I booked two commercials
before I met Josh.

27:29.288 --> 27:30.487
It's just, I stopped auditioning

27:30.489 --> 27:31.555
when I got pregnant.

27:31.557 --> 27:32.623
Then the move to San Francisco

27:32.625 --> 27:35.292
was a career killer, and...

27:35.294 --> 27:37.360
I was supposed to keep flying
back to L.A.

27:39.832 --> 27:41.198
It's just...

27:41.200 --> 27:42.434
Jesus. Watch it.

27:44.336 --> 27:47.470
Ugh. That's crazy.

27:47.472 --> 27:51.243
Been having so many
crazy coincidences lately.

28:10.729 --> 28:12.664
Yeah, that's what he said.

28:35.520 --> 28:37.554
- Anyways, we should go back to our place.
- Sure.

28:37.556 --> 28:39.421
- I think it's vodka o'clock.
- Oh, yeah. Definitely.

28:39.423 --> 28:41.190
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay, good. Let's pack up.

28:41.192 --> 28:42.659
Okay.

28:45.364 --> 28:46.662
Where's Jason?

28:46.664 --> 28:47.831
Mm...

28:47.833 --> 28:50.566
Jason. Where's Jason?

28:50.568 --> 28:52.369
Gabe.

28:52.371 --> 28:54.403
Where's Jason?

28:54.405 --> 28:56.273
Jason?

28:57.875 --> 28:59.345
Jason?

29:00.846 --> 29:03.348
- Jason?
- Jason!

29:04.449 --> 29:06.586
- Jason?
- Jason!

29:10.556 --> 29:12.455
- Where were you?
- I was in the bath...

29:12.457 --> 29:14.324
No! You don't do that.

29:14.326 --> 29:15.926
You don't run off
without telling me.

29:15.928 --> 29:17.693
- Ow.
- I'm sorry.

29:17.695 --> 29:19.461
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, we're good.

29:19.463 --> 29:22.268
- We're good. All right.
- You don't do that to me.

29:24.236 --> 29:26.268
- Understand?
- Sorry.

29:26.270 --> 29:27.671
I'm gonna get ready to go.

29:27.673 --> 29:29.305
- Okay?
- I think we're gonna head out.

29:29.307 --> 29:30.673
- Yeah.
- Okay?

29:30.675 --> 29:32.741
- No worries.
- Yeah, we're...

29:32.743 --> 29:35.644
<i>The Houston
Astros were essentially short</i>

29:35.646 --> 29:38.381
<i>one everyday player
heading into the season.</i>

29:38.383 --> 29:39.716
<i>No incumbent...</i>

29:39.718 --> 29:41.785
You saw their new car, right?

29:41.787 --> 29:43.519
He had to do it.

29:43.521 --> 29:46.256
He just had to get that thing
to fuck with me, too.

29:46.258 --> 29:47.724
I guess mission accomplished.

29:47.726 --> 29:50.259
Don't run inside.

29:56.335 --> 29:58.969
Way to freak Mom out.

29:58.971 --> 30:00.536
<i>And here's something you don't</i>

30:00.538 --> 30:02.538
<i>see every day:
extra innings in Minnesota.</i>

30:02.540 --> 30:03.806
I'm gonna go say good night.

30:03.808 --> 30:06.742
<i>11-11,
tied in the seventh inning.</i>

30:06.744 --> 30:09.645
<i>Yeah, you see, Hollister, known
for his late-inning fastball,</i>

30:09.647 --> 30:11.314
<i>comes in at a cool...</i>

30:11.316 --> 30:13.315
You good?

30:13.317 --> 30:17.353
I'm just gonna watch
the Giants highlights, okay?

30:17.355 --> 30:21.391
I'll see you later
in the magic room.

30:21.393 --> 30:22.992
Night-night.

30:22.994 --> 30:25.894
- Good night.
- Phone off.

30:46.451 --> 30:47.920
Mask off.

30:51.589 --> 30:54.024
You thought I was dead?

30:54.026 --> 30:57.326
Um, no. Uh, I just...

30:57.328 --> 31:01.030
I just didn't know
if you were lost or...

31:01.032 --> 31:03.533
taken or...

31:03.535 --> 31:05.834
By terrorists and perverts?

31:09.775 --> 31:14.313
Stick with me,
and I'll keep you safe, okay?

31:24.623 --> 31:26.292
Look.

31:30.561 --> 31:32.365
11:11.

31:36.401 --> 31:37.836
Bedtime.

32:05.130 --> 32:07.533
Who's this?

32:12.671 --> 32:14.671
<i>You know, I was thinking about</i>

32:14.673 --> 32:17.606
getting some fishing gear
tomorrow.

32:17.608 --> 32:20.776
Four rods, we can all
go fish off the dock.

32:20.778 --> 32:23.546
You know?

32:23.548 --> 32:25.750
Of course,
there's the boat, too.

32:29.755 --> 32:33.155
I'm just saying, if we could
get out there in open water...

32:33.157 --> 32:36.494
I'm not trying to force anyone.

32:57.648 --> 32:59.451
Hey.

33:01.420 --> 33:03.420
Gabe, I want to go.

33:03.422 --> 33:05.555
Where you trying to go?

33:05.557 --> 33:07.657
I can't be here. I...

33:07.659 --> 33:10.826
It's too much.

33:10.828 --> 33:12.528
You serious?

33:12.530 --> 33:14.930
Being here, it, um...

33:14.932 --> 33:17.467
Hmm.

33:17.469 --> 33:19.803
It feels like...

33:19.805 --> 33:21.440
there's this, um...

33:23.508 --> 33:27.610
...black cloud
just hanging over me,

33:27.612 --> 33:30.212
and, uh...

33:30.214 --> 33:33.682
I don't feel like myself.

33:33.684 --> 33:36.054
I think you look like yourself.

33:43.228 --> 33:45.431
Okay. Yeah.

34:01.011 --> 34:03.813
When I was a kid,

34:03.815 --> 34:06.852
I went to that boardwalk
with my parents.

34:08.619 --> 34:10.585
<i>I wandered off.</i>

34:10.588 --> 34:13.088
<i>I don't know why. I just did.</i>

34:13.090 --> 34:15.661
<i>I ended up
in that hall of mirrors.</i>

34:17.628 --> 34:20.132
<i>There was another girl
in there.</i>

34:22.934 --> 34:25.735
<i>She looked like me.</i>

34:25.737 --> 34:28.905
<i>Exactly like me.</i>

34:28.907 --> 34:30.806
But you were in
the hall of mirrors...

34:30.809 --> 34:33.007
She wasn't a reflection.

34:33.010 --> 34:35.079
She was real.

34:37.547 --> 34:40.148
She was real.

34:40.150 --> 34:41.684
She...

34:48.193 --> 34:51.996
I ran as fast as I could.

34:56.902 --> 34:59.070
My whole life, I've...

35:02.706 --> 35:07.045
I've felt like
she's still coming for me.

35:08.146 --> 35:09.945
Okay, well, whatever happened,

35:09.947 --> 35:12.817
happened a-a long time ago,
right?

35:14.952 --> 35:18.054
You know how sometimes
things line up?

35:18.056 --> 35:20.822
- Yeah.
- You know, like coincidences.

35:20.824 --> 35:22.758
Since we've been here,

35:22.760 --> 35:25.864
they've been happening
more and more.

35:27.798 --> 35:31.700
I think...
I feel like it means,

35:31.702 --> 35:33.938
like, she's getting closer.

35:35.340 --> 35:38.043
Who? The mirror girl?

35:40.679 --> 35:42.644
You don't believe me.

35:42.646 --> 35:44.012
I-I... I-I do.

35:44.014 --> 35:45.615
I do.

35:45.617 --> 35:48.784
I'm-I'm processing. Okay?

35:48.786 --> 35:52.021
I just...

35:52.023 --> 35:57.025
can't believe you kept
all this inside for so long.

35:57.027 --> 35:58.595
Come on.

35:58.597 --> 36:00.662
You know I'm here, right?

36:00.664 --> 36:02.599
I'm pretty sure
I could kick your ass,

36:02.601 --> 36:05.767
so if she looks like you,
then...

36:09.039 --> 36:11.007
Okay. Bad joke.

36:11.009 --> 36:12.641
All right.

36:12.643 --> 36:14.744
I'm sorry. My bad.

36:14.746 --> 36:16.746
I'm just trying
to lighten the mood.

36:18.016 --> 36:20.016
Oh, shit.

36:20.018 --> 36:22.651
We lost power.
Perfect timing.

36:22.653 --> 36:25.287
See, this is why Josh has
a backup generator.

36:26.690 --> 36:28.191
God! Hell!

36:28.193 --> 36:29.992
Jesus!

36:29.994 --> 36:32.028
Okay, we lost power.
Go back to bed.

36:32.030 --> 36:34.697
There's a family
in our driveway.

36:34.699 --> 36:38.967
What? There is not a family
in our driveway.

36:42.039 --> 36:45.407
Huh. Who is that?

36:45.409 --> 36:47.075
Uh-uh.

36:47.077 --> 36:49.012
Oh, it is a family.

36:49.014 --> 36:50.749
What, y'all scared of a family?

36:51.849 --> 36:53.715
A bogeyman's family.

36:53.717 --> 36:55.985
Okay, all right.
Enough... enough of that.

36:55.987 --> 36:57.220
No. Uh-uh.

36:57.222 --> 36:59.889
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Uh-uh.

36:59.891 --> 37:01.257
What?

37:01.259 --> 37:02.724
Zora, give me your phone.

37:02.726 --> 37:03.925
- I'm not on it.
- Zora!

37:03.927 --> 37:05.662
Sorry.

37:05.664 --> 37:07.063
Is there someone outside?

37:07.065 --> 37:10.066
It's just a family
standing outside.

37:10.068 --> 37:13.135
It's probably the neighbors.

37:13.137 --> 37:13.970
You're kidding me, right?

37:13.972 --> 37:15.204
- Hello.
- I'm scared.

37:15.206 --> 37:16.738
My name is Adelaide Wilson.

37:16.740 --> 37:18.106
Are you seriously
calling 911 right now?

37:18.108 --> 37:19.441
We're at 2311 Seagull Way. Shh!

37:19.443 --> 37:21.077
Everything's good.
We lost power.

37:21.079 --> 37:22.711
There are four trespassers
on our property.

37:22.713 --> 37:23.979
- All right, sure, okay.
- Yes.

37:23.981 --> 37:25.380
- You know what?
- What?

37:25.382 --> 37:27.717
- I'm gonna fix this.
- No, we don't.

37:27.719 --> 37:29.385
- I'm gonna find out who they are...
- What?

37:29.387 --> 37:31.253
No, they haven't,
but I know they will.

37:31.255 --> 37:33.088
...find out what they want,
and everything's gonna be fine.

37:33.090 --> 37:34.856
- Gabe.
- Calm down, okay?

37:34.858 --> 37:36.391
15 minutes?
No, no, no, that's too long.

37:36.393 --> 37:37.927
Oh, boy.

37:37.929 --> 37:39.729
No, you don't,
you don't understand. We...

37:39.731 --> 37:42.097
How about we all just try
to keep calm...

37:42.099 --> 37:43.965
- Gabe. - Dad.
- ...keep our heads,

37:43.967 --> 37:45.400
and everything's gonna
be all right.

37:45.402 --> 37:47.135
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:47.137 --> 37:49.137
Just one sec... Gabe.

37:56.347 --> 37:58.380
Trying to have a vacation,

37:58.382 --> 38:01.450
and my whole family lost
they goddamn minds.

38:04.054 --> 38:05.954
Hi.

38:05.956 --> 38:07.960
Can I help you?

38:13.965 --> 38:16.331
Okay.

38:16.333 --> 38:19.501
If y'all are out here
trying to scare people,

38:19.503 --> 38:22.340
I think you picked
the wrong house for that.

38:26.244 --> 38:28.244
Zora...

38:28.246 --> 38:30.182
put your shoes on.

38:33.784 --> 38:36.952
I... I asked you nice.

38:36.954 --> 38:40.224
Now I need y'all
to get off my property.

38:51.001 --> 38:52.471
Okay.

39:09.353 --> 39:11.887
Okay, let's call the cops.

39:11.889 --> 39:14.356
I did.
They're 14 minutes away.

39:14.358 --> 39:16.892
What? 14 minutes?

39:16.894 --> 39:20.162
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

39:20.164 --> 39:21.963
Okay, okay.

39:21.965 --> 39:24.499
- Jason, give me the bat.
- What bat?

39:24.501 --> 39:26.202
The baseball bat. The bat.

39:26.204 --> 39:27.936
- There's one in the cl...
- Here, here.

39:27.938 --> 39:29.005
- Thank you.
- Gabe?

39:29.007 --> 39:30.305
All right, hold on.

39:30.307 --> 39:31.941
I got this.
Let's try this again.

39:31.943 --> 39:35.177
- Gabe?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

39:35.179 --> 39:37.112
All right.

39:37.114 --> 39:39.884
- Gabe!
- I got this. I got this.

39:43.954 --> 39:46.222
Now, I thought
I already done told y'all

39:46.224 --> 39:48.291
to get off my property.

39:48.293 --> 39:53.295
Okay? So, if y'all want to
get crazy, we can get crazy.

39:53.297 --> 39:57.769
Now, the cops are
already on they way.

40:01.905 --> 40:05.273
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

40:05.275 --> 40:06.511
Hey!

40:13.451 --> 40:14.983
Oh!

40:14.985 --> 40:16.420
Sh...

40:20.190 --> 40:22.023
They're going around.

40:22.025 --> 40:23.492
Is the back door locked?

40:23.494 --> 40:25.862
- My window's open.
- Gabe... Zora, no!

40:25.864 --> 40:27.597
Gabe, Jason!

40:41.112 --> 40:43.979
Yo, I'm serious, man!

40:43.981 --> 40:46.081
I will break your head!

40:46.083 --> 40:47.985
If I were you...

40:54.525 --> 40:56.525
Gabe.

41:31.362 --> 41:33.262
- The key.
- What key?

41:33.264 --> 41:35.067
- The damn hide-a-key.
- Hide-a-key?

41:36.166 --> 41:38.469
What kind of white shit...?

41:45.610 --> 41:48.110
Oh, shit.

42:27.985 --> 42:31.186
- Mom?
- Just stay close.

42:31.188 --> 42:33.289
What's going on?

44:22.500 --> 44:24.099
What?

44:24.101 --> 44:26.434
It's us.

44:36.414 --> 44:38.380
We don't have anything here.

44:38.382 --> 44:40.316
This is our summer home.

44:40.318 --> 44:42.617
- Gabe.
- We just got in today, so...

44:42.619 --> 44:44.753
Once...

44:44.755 --> 44:46.391
upon...

44:49.226 --> 44:51.730
...a t-ime...

44:54.599 --> 44:57.833
...there was a girl.

44:57.835 --> 45:01.903
And the girl had...

45:01.905 --> 45:03.842
a sh-adow.

45:07.545 --> 45:12.313
The two were connected,

45:12.315 --> 45:14.682
tethered together.

45:14.684 --> 45:17.786
When the girl ate,

45:17.788 --> 45:20.789
her food was given to her

45:20.791 --> 45:23.791
warm and tasty.

45:23.793 --> 45:27.463
But when the shadow was hungry,

45:27.465 --> 45:29.465
she had to eat rabbit,

45:29.467 --> 45:33.235
raw and bloody.

45:33.237 --> 45:35.804
On Christmas,

45:35.806 --> 45:39.675
the girl received
wonderful toys,

45:39.677 --> 45:42.878
soft and cushy.

45:42.880 --> 45:47.182
But the shadow's toys
were so sharp and cold,

45:47.184 --> 45:49.284
they'd slice
through her fingers

45:49.286 --> 45:51.854
when she tried
to play with them.

45:51.856 --> 45:56.624
The girl met a handsome prince

45:56.626 --> 45:58.626
and fell in love,

45:58.628 --> 46:03.599
but the shadow,
at that same time,

46:03.601 --> 46:05.800
met Abraham.

46:05.802 --> 46:10.773
It didn't matter
if she loved him or not.

46:10.775 --> 46:14.876
He was tethered to
the girl's prince, after all.

46:14.878 --> 46:20.249
Then the girl had
her first child,

46:20.251 --> 46:22.550
a beautiful baby girl.

46:22.552 --> 46:24.920
But the shadow,

46:24.922 --> 46:28.757
she gave birth
to a little monster.

46:28.759 --> 46:32.760
Umbrae was born laughing.

46:32.762 --> 46:36.999
The girl had a second child,
a boy this time.

46:37.001 --> 46:42.338
They had to cut her open
and take him from her belly.

46:42.340 --> 46:46.541
The shadow had to do it all...

46:46.543 --> 46:49.411
herself.

46:49.413 --> 46:50.878
She named him Pluto.

46:50.880 --> 46:54.682
He was born to love fire.

46:54.684 --> 46:59.554
So, you see,
the shadow hated the girl

46:59.556 --> 47:03.025
so much for so long,

47:03.027 --> 47:07.996
until one day
the shadow realized

47:07.998 --> 47:13.204
she was being tested by God.

47:18.775 --> 47:20.411
Excuse me.

47:21.978 --> 47:23.747
Excuse me.

47:25.815 --> 47:27.749
What do you want?

47:27.751 --> 47:29.851
You could have my wallet.

47:29.853 --> 47:31.686
You-you could have the car.

47:31.688 --> 47:33.421
Gabe.

47:33.423 --> 47:35.360
Yeah.

47:37.894 --> 47:40.461
You can have the boat,
for all I care.

47:40.463 --> 47:43.699
Nobody wants the boat, Dad.

47:43.701 --> 47:45.467
How about this?

47:45.469 --> 47:47.469
You take me to the ATM...

47:57.081 --> 47:59.317
What are you people?

48:04.487 --> 48:07.291
We're Americans.

48:18.436 --> 48:21.503
Tether yourself to the table.

48:24.442 --> 48:25.507
Addy, don't do it.

48:25.509 --> 48:27.342
Maybe I should cut...

48:27.344 --> 48:29.380
something off of you.

48:31.581 --> 48:34.318
It's... it's okay.

48:55.106 --> 48:57.042
Just...

48:59.110 --> 49:01.713
Don't hurt my children.

49:24.668 --> 49:26.401
Yo.

49:43.521 --> 49:44.952
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Get your hands off me.

49:44.954 --> 49:46.421
- No. Gabe, no.
- No, wait, no. Dad!

49:46.423 --> 49:47.923
Wait. Wait.

49:47.925 --> 49:49.490
Get off me, man.

49:49.492 --> 49:51.159
Look, Gabe...

49:51.161 --> 49:53.695
Wait. Gabe.

49:53.697 --> 49:55.831
Oh, please,
please, please stop!

49:55.833 --> 49:57.465
- Stop, please!
- Gabe.

49:58.702 --> 50:00.869
Stop, stop. Wait. Wait.

50:00.871 --> 50:03.838
Wai... Please!

50:05.175 --> 50:07.175
Okay. Okay.

50:14.150 --> 50:16.855
- Mom.
- Little girl.

50:18.088 --> 50:19.958
Run!

50:21.192 --> 50:23.827
Go.

50:54.090 --> 50:55.657
You want me, right?

51:02.632 --> 51:03.932
No.

51:03.934 --> 51:06.168
- He's not going.
- Careful.

51:06.170 --> 51:09.771
He has a t-emper.

51:37.867 --> 51:41.036
No, no, no, no, no, no,

51:41.038 --> 51:43.740
no, no, no, not that shit.

51:46.110 --> 51:48.142
No. No.

51:48.144 --> 51:50.081
Okay.

51:51.681 --> 51:53.180
- I'm scared.
- Look...

51:53.182 --> 51:54.916
Look at me.

51:54.918 --> 51:57.221
You're gonna be okay.

52:01.190 --> 52:04.726
Show him one of your tricks.

52:04.728 --> 52:06.595
Okay.

52:08.932 --> 52:10.632
Go play, boys.

52:14.237 --> 52:19.007
Don't burn our house down.

52:43.032 --> 52:44.365
Stop, man.

52:44.367 --> 52:46.133
Please stop.

52:46.135 --> 52:48.306
No, no, stop, stop, stop.

52:50.139 --> 52:51.840
Please.

52:51.842 --> 52:53.708
Come on, man, stop.

52:53.710 --> 52:55.376
Stop it.

52:56.947 --> 52:59.280
I got a family, man.
Please don't. No.

55:16.385 --> 55:18.322
What the fuck?

55:20.891 --> 55:23.327
Get off my car!

55:26.163 --> 55:29.164
Are you...?
Come here. Come...

55:29.166 --> 55:31.436
Goddamn it,
get your ass over here.

55:36.773 --> 55:39.240
I said, "Come here."

55:39.242 --> 55:40.941
Kid, I'm talking to you.

55:48.918 --> 55:51.054
What do you want?

55:59.429 --> 56:01.231
What?

56:08.070 --> 56:09.740
What do we want?

56:11.809 --> 56:13.974
We want...

56:13.976 --> 56:16.413
to take our t-ime.

56:18.081 --> 56:21.449
We've been waiting for this day

56:21.451 --> 56:24.088
for so long.

56:26.356 --> 56:28.389
I call it...

56:28.391 --> 56:32.163
"The Untethering."

58:54.304 --> 58:56.104
That's yours.

01:00:30.333 --> 01:00:32.467
It hangs to the left.

01:00:32.469 --> 01:00:34.672
It hangs to the goddamn left.

01:02:06.795 --> 01:02:08.498
Jason.

01:02:28.251 --> 01:02:30.617
Jason.

01:02:33.255 --> 01:02:34.688
Baby.

01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:36.324
Come on. Come on.

01:02:38.961 --> 01:02:40.662
Let's go.

01:02:45.869 --> 01:02:47.601
Keys.

01:02:51.708 --> 01:02:54.541
- Mom! Mom!
- Zora!

01:02:58.215 --> 01:02:59.880
This way. Come on!

01:02:59.882 --> 01:03:01.451
Come on, come on!
Go, go, go!

01:03:03.353 --> 01:03:04.952
Hey!

01:03:14.264 --> 01:03:16.530
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on,

01:03:16.532 --> 01:03:19.300
come on, come on, come on.

01:03:21.003 --> 01:03:24.572
Oh. Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:04:09.385 --> 01:04:12.586
- Josh? What was that?
- What?

01:04:12.588 --> 01:04:14.488
I heard something outside.

01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:17.358
Okay.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.594
A rustling.
Walking, like a person.

01:04:19.596 --> 01:04:21.862
There's a person walking around
outside our fucking house.

01:04:21.864 --> 01:04:23.865
It's probably a squirrel.
I don't know.

01:04:23.867 --> 01:04:25.603
Would you please get up
and look?

01:04:26.936 --> 01:04:29.704
I'm busy.
I'm... I'm busy.

01:04:29.706 --> 01:04:31.275
So...

01:04:33.543 --> 01:04:36.677
Maybe it's a-a pizza guy.
Maybe the girls ordered pizza.

01:04:36.679 --> 01:04:39.079
Get up and take a look.
I'm scared.

01:04:39.081 --> 01:04:40.914
Oh, I don't want to.
I want to stay down here.

01:04:40.916 --> 01:04:42.617
I want to just stay
in my cozy spot.

01:04:42.619 --> 01:04:44.351
- Get up and look.
- Jesus Christ.

01:04:44.353 --> 01:04:46.320
Hey, uh, Ophelia, lights up.

01:04:46.322 --> 01:04:48.523
Turning lights up.

01:04:48.525 --> 01:04:50.958
I feel like I heard the
backup generator go on, too.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.860
What do you know
about the backup generator?

01:04:52.862 --> 01:04:54.896
Can you stop being
an asshole for two seconds?

01:04:54.898 --> 01:04:56.998
- Just look.
- All right. I'm looking.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.800
I'll get my binoculars.

01:04:58.802 --> 01:05:01.702
I see nothing.
I see beautiful stars.

01:05:01.704 --> 01:05:03.371
Are you really looking?

01:05:03.373 --> 01:05:05.505
Yeah, I'm looking.

01:05:05.507 --> 01:05:07.575
Oh, shit.
No, yeah, I...

01:05:07.577 --> 01:05:09.510
- There's something out there.
- Don't fuck with me, Josh.

01:05:09.512 --> 01:05:10.978
I'm not fucking with you.
I'm serious.

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.347
There's something out there.
Look.

01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:13.981
Look behind the car.

01:05:13.983 --> 01:05:15.983
- Where? I don't see it.
- It's by the car.

01:05:15.985 --> 01:05:17.517
- Look.
- I can't...

01:05:17.519 --> 01:05:19.019
- Oh, shit.
- What?

01:05:19.021 --> 01:05:21.722
Oh, my God, it's O.J.

01:05:21.724 --> 01:05:24.958
It's O.J. Simpson.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.662
What is wrong with you?
Seriously.

01:05:28.998 --> 01:05:30.430
Ophelia,
give me some Beach Boys.

01:05:30.432 --> 01:05:31.599
Playing "Good Vibrations"

01:05:31.601 --> 01:05:32.766
- by the Beach Boys.
- Really? - Why not?

01:05:32.768 --> 01:05:34.668
It's our last night here.

01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:36.503
- Let's have a little party.
- Ophelia, turn it down.

01:05:36.505 --> 01:05:38.139
Turning down "Good
Vibrations" by the Beach Boys.

01:05:38.141 --> 01:05:40.041
Would you chill out, all right?
There's nobody out there.

01:05:40.043 --> 01:05:42.043
Just go back upstairs.
I'll be up in a few minutes.

01:05:42.045 --> 01:05:43.644
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:05:43.646 --> 01:05:45.612
What's going on?

01:05:45.614 --> 01:05:47.148
Uh, nothing.

01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:48.548
- Nothing, guys.
- Jesus.

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:49.883
The backup generator went on.

01:05:49.885 --> 01:05:51.619
We're just trying
to figure it out.

01:05:51.621 --> 01:05:53.621
- Go back to sleep.
- Just because we're in our rooms

01:05:53.623 --> 01:05:55.055
doesn't mean we're sleeping.

01:05:55.057 --> 01:05:56.891
Fine. I don't know.
Go back to your rooms.

01:05:56.893 --> 01:05:58.492
Guys, we have to be out of here

01:05:58.494 --> 01:05:59.894
at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow,
sharp, so...

01:06:01.697 --> 01:06:03.697
- Hello?
- Oh, my God.

01:06:06.001 --> 01:06:07.802
Josh!

01:07:23.545 --> 01:07:25.713
Please stop.

01:07:25.715 --> 01:07:29.550
Stopping "Good
Vibrations" by the Beach Boys.

01:07:32.621 --> 01:07:34.557
Ophelia...

01:07:36.893 --> 01:07:39.025
Ophelia, call the police.

01:07:39.027 --> 01:07:40.494
Sure.

01:07:40.496 --> 01:07:43.097
Playing "Fuck tha Police"
by N.W.A.

01:07:57.179 --> 01:08:00.680
Josh, we need your help.

01:08:07.556 --> 01:08:09.891
Addy!

01:08:12.661 --> 01:08:15.128
Addy!

01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:17.264
No!

01:08:17.265 --> 01:08:19.834
No! No! No! No!

01:08:21.738 --> 01:08:24.006
Go, go, go, go, go, go. Run.

01:08:36.953 --> 01:08:38.919
Come here!

01:08:38.921 --> 01:08:41.791
Huh? Follow me!

01:08:42.926 --> 01:08:44.658
Yeah.

01:08:46.328 --> 01:08:48.696
Let's go, Bad Josh!

01:08:48.698 --> 01:08:51.131
Let's go!

01:08:53.002 --> 01:08:55.135
Hey!

01:09:31.207 --> 01:09:34.040
No! No! No!

01:12:47.904 --> 01:12:50.103
Come on!

01:12:50.105 --> 01:12:52.442
Goddamn it.

01:15:12.581 --> 01:15:15.281
No, no, no, no. Please.

01:15:15.283 --> 01:15:17.518
No, no. No.
No, no. No.

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.352
No! No, no.

01:15:19.354 --> 01:15:21.187
No, Zora. No!

01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:23.389
Please, please.

01:15:23.391 --> 01:15:26.125
No! No!

01:15:26.127 --> 01:15:28.062
No, please, no!

01:15:28.064 --> 01:15:31.365
No, no, no.

01:15:56.591 --> 01:15:58.659
It was unlocked.

01:15:58.661 --> 01:16:02.428
Boats are done.

01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:04.430
I am done with boats.

01:16:16.145 --> 01:16:18.711
I can't believe they're dead.

01:16:20.682 --> 01:16:22.683
Why are they doing this?

01:16:22.685 --> 01:16:24.718
I'm sorry,
but all of our operators

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.452
are busy at the moment.

01:16:26.454 --> 01:16:28.187
Please hold, and the next
available operator will...

01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:29.790
It's all just craziness.

01:16:29.792 --> 01:16:32.291
I'm sorry,
but all of our operators

01:16:32.293 --> 01:16:33.729
are busy at the moment.
Please...

01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:38.499
How does 911 keep you on hold
all night long?

01:16:38.501 --> 01:16:40.567
I just don't get it.

01:16:40.569 --> 01:16:43.070
It's too many twins, man.

01:16:50.046 --> 01:16:52.345
How many of everybody
is there gonna be?

01:17:04.159 --> 01:17:05.259
<i>The boardwalk
was getting ready to close,</i>

01:17:05.261 --> 01:17:06.660
<i>and a bunch of us
had just gotten out,</i>

01:17:06.662 --> 01:17:09.329
<i>and we were going to our cars
when the attack happened.</i>

01:17:09.331 --> 01:17:10.496
- Oh, shit.
- <i>People were shouting, and...</i>

01:17:10.498 --> 01:17:11.732
- Don't curse.
- <i>...I-I just thought it was</i>

01:17:11.734 --> 01:17:14.201
<i>somebody acting out,
and then we just saw red.</i>

01:17:14.203 --> 01:17:16.335
- <i>Uh, you saw red?</i>
- <i>Yes, they were wearing red.</i>

01:17:16.337 --> 01:17:18.071
<i>They didn't look right.
They had scissors,</i>

01:17:18.073 --> 01:17:20.307
<i>and they were just walking up
to people in the crowd</i>

01:17:20.309 --> 01:17:21.808
<i>and stabbing them.</i>

01:17:21.810 --> 01:17:23.843
<i>You said
they were stabbing people?</i>

01:17:23.845 --> 01:17:25.379
<i>Yeah, it was chaos,</i>

01:17:25.381 --> 01:17:27.080
<i>and then we-we just
started running.</i>

01:17:27.082 --> 01:17:28.315
<i>Where-where did they come from?</i>

01:17:28.317 --> 01:17:29.849
<i>What? I-I-I don't know.</i>

01:17:29.851 --> 01:17:32.218
<i>Someone said that they were
coming from the sewers.</i>

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.187
<i>The sewers?
Okay, how many are...</i>

01:17:34.189 --> 01:17:36.123
<i>I'm sorry.
I think they're coming.</i>

01:17:36.125 --> 01:17:38.625
<i>Uh, uh, ma'am?</i>

01:17:38.627 --> 01:17:41.327
<i>Ma'am?</i>

01:17:41.329 --> 01:17:45.365
<i>Um, okay, uh, so we certainly
hope everything is okay there.</i>

01:17:45.367 --> 01:17:48.335
<i>It's too early to say
what exactly is unfolding,</i>

01:17:48.337 --> 01:17:50.470
<i>but it does appear
we are in the midst</i>

01:17:50.472 --> 01:17:52.473
<i>of a brutal
and terrifying attack</i>

01:17:52.475 --> 01:17:55.241
<i>by people who are being
described as wearing red,</i>

01:17:55.243 --> 01:17:56.876
<i>carrying scissors or shears,
and doing</i>

01:17:56.878 --> 01:17:59.513
<i>what can only be described
as wreaking havoc on folks</i>

01:17:59.515 --> 01:18:02.348
- <i>just out for a Friday night.</i>
- And they look like us.

01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:04.351
They don't even know that yet.

01:18:04.353 --> 01:18:06.120
<i>Okay, Chris,
I'm gonna cut you off.</i>

01:18:06.122 --> 01:18:08.625
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>We have new images coming in here.</i>

01:18:11.226 --> 01:18:13.759
<i>Here, we see a man</i>

01:18:13.761 --> 01:18:16.562
<i>wearing red who...</i>

01:18:16.564 --> 01:18:18.264
<i>Okay, this...</i>

01:18:18.266 --> 01:18:21.268
<i>this seems to be
a group of individuals</i>

01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:25.606
<i>engaged in some sort
of demonstration or protest.</i>

01:18:25.608 --> 01:18:28.608
<i>It-it's not clear at this time
if or how</i>

01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:29.777
<i>these people are connected
to the attacks.</i>

01:18:29.779 --> 01:18:31.644
- What is that?
- <i>They are forming what looks</i>

01:18:31.646 --> 01:18:33.312
- <i>like a human chain.</i>
- That's them.

01:18:33.314 --> 01:18:35.148
What are they doing?

01:18:35.150 --> 01:18:36.583
I don't know,
but that would take

01:18:36.585 --> 01:18:38.755
a shitload of coordination.

01:18:40.655 --> 01:18:42.589
<i>So, obviously,
if you have children present</i>

01:18:42.591 --> 01:18:45.259
<i>watching us right now,
you should turn them away.</i>

01:18:45.261 --> 01:18:47.628
<i>We aren't sure
what is about to happen.</i>

01:18:49.864 --> 01:18:53.232
- We have to go.
- What? You're joking, right?

01:18:53.234 --> 01:18:55.501
Zora, Jason, help your father.

01:18:55.503 --> 01:18:57.905
Wait, she's trippin'.
Where would we go?

01:18:57.907 --> 01:18:59.572
- The police, right?
- No.

01:18:59.574 --> 01:19:01.808
We need to move
and keep moving.

01:19:01.810 --> 01:19:03.277
We take the coast.

01:19:03.279 --> 01:19:05.411
- We go to Mexico.
- Mexico?

01:19:05.413 --> 01:19:07.380
Okay. Whoa.

01:19:07.382 --> 01:19:09.183
Whoa. Whoa!

01:19:09.185 --> 01:19:11.718
We got everything we need here.

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:13.519
Food, water, backup generator.

01:19:13.521 --> 01:19:15.888
We're as safe here
as we're gonna be anywhere.

01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:17.759
Tell that to Josh and Kitty.
They're right here.

01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:23.629
- You're scaring the kids.
- Too late.

01:19:23.631 --> 01:19:26.567
They think like us.
They know where we are.

01:19:26.569 --> 01:19:30.336
They won't stop until
they kill us or we kill them.

01:19:30.338 --> 01:19:32.606
Then let's make
some traps or something.

01:19:32.608 --> 01:19:34.607
Like, some <i>Home Alone</i>
type stuff.

01:19:34.609 --> 01:19:35.742
That way, if she comes...

01:19:35.744 --> 01:19:37.811
Tell me you did not
just reference <i>Home Alone.</i>

01:19:37.813 --> 01:19:39.845
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Gabe.

01:19:39.847 --> 01:19:41.682
They've been planning this.

01:19:41.684 --> 01:19:43.517
They have the upper hand.

01:19:43.519 --> 01:19:45.518
This is the time to run,

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.824
not to be sprinkling
Micro Machines on the floor.

01:19:49.925 --> 01:19:51.424
What are Micro Machines?

01:19:51.426 --> 01:19:52.960
What's <i>Home Alone?</i>

01:19:52.962 --> 01:19:55.629
We're not going anywhere,
and that's final.

01:19:55.631 --> 01:19:58.868
You don't get to make
the decisions anymore!

01:20:04.939 --> 01:20:07.473
So...

01:20:07.475 --> 01:20:10.380
does this mean
we get their car?

01:20:13.349 --> 01:20:15.949
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

01:20:15.951 --> 01:20:17.718
Who's got the keys?

01:21:45.974 --> 01:21:47.710
Come on.

01:21:50.945 --> 01:21:52.713
- Let's go.
- Get in the car.

01:21:52.715 --> 01:21:54.380
Get in the car.

01:21:55.751 --> 01:21:57.451
- I'm driving.
- No way.

01:21:57.453 --> 01:21:59.018
I told her no.

01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:00.887
Dad's leg is messed up.
You're handcuffed.

01:22:00.889 --> 01:22:02.555
It's not safe.
I'm driving.

01:22:02.557 --> 01:22:03.956
Zora, no.

01:22:03.958 --> 01:22:05.858
I have the highest kill count
in the family.

01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:07.660
You don't have
the highest kill count.

01:22:07.662 --> 01:22:08.928
I killed both twins.

01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:10.796
Wrong.
I just killed the second one.

01:22:10.798 --> 01:22:12.499
I killed Kitty.

01:22:12.501 --> 01:22:15.568
So that's one, one,
one and two. I killed two.

01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:17.603
I killed myself and Josh, so...

01:22:17.605 --> 01:22:18.804
Zo... It doesn't matter.

01:22:18.806 --> 01:22:20.473
Zora, get in the back.

01:22:20.475 --> 01:22:22.075
- Look! - No.
- Oh, shit, put the windows up.

01:22:22.077 --> 01:22:23.646
Put the windows up.
Put the windows up.

01:22:38.627 --> 01:22:40.026
Okay.

01:22:40.028 --> 01:22:42.129
You're gonna want to...

01:22:42.131 --> 01:22:44.033
back up.

01:22:45.868 --> 01:22:47.737
- Buckle up.
- Huh?

01:22:50.805 --> 01:22:52.805
- Zora!
- Whoa...

01:22:52.807 --> 01:22:55.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:22:55.877 --> 01:22:57.811
Where is she? Did I get her?

01:23:09.056 --> 01:23:11.057
She's there, she's there!

01:23:11.059 --> 01:23:12.425
Jesus!

01:23:20.034 --> 01:23:21.503
Okay.

01:23:37.085 --> 01:23:40.019
Zora.

01:23:40.021 --> 01:23:42.455
Be careful.

01:23:43.625 --> 01:23:45.858
Okay, you're going too fast!

01:23:51.632 --> 01:23:53.168
She's dead now, right?

01:23:58.673 --> 01:24:00.540
- What are you doing?
- Mom.

01:24:00.542 --> 01:24:02.241
Where's she going?
Wait... And she left.

01:24:02.243 --> 01:24:04.710
Your mom left the car.

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:47.653
Shh, shh.

01:24:57.733 --> 01:24:59.098
Shh.

01:26:37.332 --> 01:26:39.933
Whoa.

01:26:39.935 --> 01:26:42.134
Is that our car?

01:26:42.136 --> 01:26:44.303
It's the one
that looks like me.

01:26:46.675 --> 01:26:47.941
Shit.

01:26:47.943 --> 01:26:49.579
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What, what?

01:27:07.929 --> 01:27:10.833
Stay in the car.
Lock the doors.

01:27:41.262 --> 01:27:43.295
What is she doing?

01:28:05.787 --> 01:28:07.356
It's a trap.

01:28:09.291 --> 01:28:11.159
Get out.

01:28:31.512 --> 01:28:33.215
Please.

01:28:46.895 --> 01:28:48.364
No.

01:29:02.978 --> 01:29:05.247
No.

01:29:29.837 --> 01:29:32.340
Jason. Jason!

01:29:33.841 --> 01:29:35.508
Jason?

01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:37.246
Jason!

01:29:39.314 --> 01:29:41.113
Jason!

01:29:41.115 --> 01:29:43.415
No! No!

01:29:43.417 --> 01:29:45.285
- Addy!
- Mom!

01:34:47.889 --> 01:34:49.488
Here.

01:34:49.490 --> 01:34:50.889
- We can hide here.
- Okay.

01:34:50.891 --> 01:34:53.392
- They probably got bandages and stuff.
- Okay.

01:34:55.697 --> 01:34:57.463
Mom knows what to do.

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.210
Look.

01:35:11.613 --> 01:35:13.315
It's the line.

01:35:16.917 --> 01:35:20.322
Looks like some kind
of fucked-up performance art.

01:35:48.248 --> 01:35:50.816
Where is he?

01:35:54.521 --> 01:35:58.527
How it must have been
to grow up with the sky.

01:35:59.827 --> 01:36:04.196
To feel the sun,
the wind, the trees.

01:36:04.198 --> 01:36:07.633
But your people
took it for granted.

01:36:07.635 --> 01:36:10.503
We're human, too, you know.

01:36:10.505 --> 01:36:13.539
Eyes, teeth,

01:36:13.541 --> 01:36:16.378
hands, blood.

01:36:17.478 --> 01:36:20.245
Exactly like you.

01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:24.349
And yet...

01:36:24.351 --> 01:36:27.753
it was humans

01:36:27.755 --> 01:36:29.955
that built this place.

01:36:29.957 --> 01:36:34.893
I believe they figured out
how to make a copy of the body

01:36:34.895 --> 01:36:36.896
but not the soul.

01:36:36.898 --> 01:36:40.799
The soul remains one,
shared by two.

01:36:40.801 --> 01:36:43.835
They created the T-ethered

01:36:43.837 --> 01:36:48.708
so they could use them
to control the ones above.

01:36:48.710 --> 01:36:50.279
Like puppets.

01:36:51.779 --> 01:36:56.715
But they failed, and they
ab-andoned the Tethered.

01:36:56.717 --> 01:37:00.785
For generations, the Tethered
continued without direction.

01:37:02.489 --> 01:37:04.893
They all went mad down here.

01:37:08.829 --> 01:37:12.865
And then... there was us.

01:37:15.302 --> 01:37:16.902
Put some heat on that one.

01:37:16.904 --> 01:37:19.405
Yeah, I guess
I missed my chance to go pro.

01:37:19.407 --> 01:37:20.909
<i>You remember?</i>

01:37:26.814 --> 01:37:30.683
We were born special.

01:37:30.685 --> 01:37:33.952
- I want number 11.
- Yeah?

01:38:19.033 --> 01:38:20.933
Addy, you want to try it?

01:38:44.992 --> 01:38:49.928
God brought us tog-ether
that night.

01:39:36.543 --> 01:39:40.414
I never st-op thinking
about you.

01:39:42.182 --> 01:39:45.151
<i>How things could have been.</i>

01:39:45.153 --> 01:39:48.787
<i>How you could have
taken me with you.</i>

01:39:52.126 --> 01:39:54.160
Years after we met...

01:39:56.497 --> 01:39:58.533
<i>...the miracle happened.</i>

01:40:01.435 --> 01:40:03.902
<i>That's when I saw God,</i>

01:40:03.904 --> 01:40:07.839
<i>and he showed me my path.</i>

01:40:07.841 --> 01:40:09.942
<i>You felt it, too.</i>

01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:15.447
<i>The end of our dance,</i>

01:40:15.449 --> 01:40:19.218
<i>the Tethered saw
that I was different.</i>

01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:23.022
<i>That I would deliver them
from this misery.</i>

01:40:23.024 --> 01:40:26.125
I found my faith,

01:40:26.127 --> 01:40:28.964
and I began to prepare.

01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:33.732
<i>It took years to plan.</i>

01:40:39.707 --> 01:40:42.110
<i>Everything had to be perfect.</i>

01:40:45.846 --> 01:40:48.613
<i>I didn't just need to kill you.</i>

01:40:48.615 --> 01:40:51.784
<i>I needed to m-ake a statement</i>

01:40:51.786 --> 01:40:54.722
<i>that the whole world would see.</i>

01:40:58.158 --> 01:41:00.593
It's our time now.

01:41:00.595 --> 01:41:03.597
Our t-ime up there.

01:41:15.810 --> 01:41:18.043
And to think,

01:41:18.045 --> 01:41:20.181
if it weren't for you...

01:41:22.850 --> 01:41:26.087
...I never would have
danced at all.

01:46:39.065 --> 01:46:41.567
My baby. My baby.

01:46:41.569 --> 01:46:43.869
I found you.

01:46:43.871 --> 01:46:45.172
Oh!

01:46:47.574 --> 01:46:49.107
Look.

01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:50.545
Look, look, look.

01:46:59.587 --> 01:47:02.888
They're all gone now.

01:47:02.890 --> 01:47:04.423
Okay?

01:47:04.425 --> 01:47:06.360
They can't hurt you.

01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:10.298
You understand?

01:47:11.465 --> 01:47:13.397
Uh-uh.

01:47:15.402 --> 01:47:17.302
No.

01:47:17.304 --> 01:47:20.007
Everything's gonna be
like it was before.

01:47:25.578 --> 01:47:27.514
Yeah.

01:48:36.382 --> 01:48:38.650
She wasn't in 'Nam.

01:48:38.652 --> 01:48:40.986
<i>Okay? She got lost.
For 15 minutes. That's...</i>

01:48:40.988 --> 01:48:42.521
<i>That can be very scary.</i>

01:48:42.523 --> 01:48:44.423
<i>No, you don't know
what happened to her.</i>

01:48:44.425 --> 01:48:46.991
- Anything could've happened to her.
- Okay, okay.

01:48:46.993 --> 01:48:49.961
So how-how...
how do we get her to talk?

01:48:49.963 --> 01:48:52.597
<i>Encourage her to draw,</i>

01:48:52.599 --> 01:48:54.598
<i>to write, to dance.</i>

01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:57.235
<i>Anything to help her
tell us her story.</i>

01:48:58.972 --> 01:49:02.076
I just want
my little girl back.

01:50:11.177 --> 01:50:13.178
<i>Okay? She left.</i>

01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:15.580
- She...
- I told you to look after her.

01:50:15.582 --> 01:50:17.682
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Look at you.

01:50:17.684 --> 01:50:19.584
- It's not my fault she left.
- Look at you.

01:50:19.586 --> 01:50:21.553
It's not my fault
she... Yeah, well, look at me.

01:50:21.555 --> 01:50:22.757
Look at you. Look at you!
