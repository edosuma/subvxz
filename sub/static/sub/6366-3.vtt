Anastasia?

01:29.626 --> 01:31.093
Stop.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.435
Cuff yourself to the bedpost.

01:46.778 --> 01:49.346
Don't bother.

02:09.068 --> 02:14.107
You look good. Healthy.

02:14.175 --> 02:19.013
Pale, though. I think maybe
you live on the East Coast.

02:19.047 --> 02:24.351
For years I've been thinking...
"Where is she?

02:24.386 --> 02:28.522
Is she close or half the world away?

02:28.556 --> 02:32.660
Is she still nervous when it thunders?

02:32.694 --> 02:36.697
Does she remember
our walks in Coney Island?

02:36.731 --> 02:40.168
Getting borscht from Alexa's?"

02:48.678 --> 02:51.847
They're all there, every last one.

03:01.459 --> 03:04.127
And what do you want
in exchange for this?

03:05.196 --> 03:06.997
Just let me go.

03:08.867 --> 03:13.471
He found you faster than I thought.

03:13.505 --> 03:19.877
<i>He did in one week
what I failed to do in 15 years.</i>

03:19.912 --> 03:23.248
True love, huh?

03:23.282 --> 03:25.917
Just take the diamonds
and consider me dead.

03:25.952 --> 03:27.819
<i>Or what?</i>

03:27.854 --> 03:31.056
You've only given me
half of what I want.

03:33.292 --> 03:38.396
- I want him.
- I can't do that.

03:38.431 --> 03:41.533
If you could, you would be free.

03:49.176 --> 03:50.977
Your word?

03:52.113 --> 03:54.214
My word.

03:56.884 --> 04:01.788
Now...
how are you going to get away?

04:01.822 --> 04:04.157
There's something else
in the bag for you.

04:09.897 --> 04:13.867
<i>Clever Girl.</i>

04:35.323 --> 04:37.825

<i>- Banshee, PA! What's up, baby?
- Mr. Sanchez,</i>

06:16.222 --> 06:18.056
what can you tell us
about this upcoming fight?

06:18.091 --> 06:20.425
What can I tell you about...
I can tell you'd better...

06:20.460 --> 06:22.661
Benjamin, this fight will
cement your credibility

06:22.696 --> 06:24.096
with the Gaming Commission.

06:24.131 --> 06:26.332
Give me another week,
and I'll have us cleared

06:26.366 --> 06:29.302
to break ground on the hotel.

06:29.336 --> 06:35.776
I must admit I had my doubts, Kai,
but you pulled it off.

06:35.843 --> 06:37.844
It's our casino.
We're putting up the purse.

06:37.878 --> 06:40.514
<i>- He was just the middleman.
- Alex, enough.</i>

06:40.548 --> 06:42.549
<i>The champ is in the
building, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

06:42.583 --> 06:44.417
<i>The champ is in the building.</i>

06:44.452 --> 06:46.553
Mr. Sanchez, Kai Proctor.

06:46.587 --> 06:48.454
- Welcome to Banshee.
- Glad to be here.

06:48.489 --> 06:51.224
This is Benjamin Longshadow.
His tribe runs the Kinaho Moon.

06:51.258 --> 06:53.526
- Chief.
- It's an honor to have you here.

06:53.594 --> 06:56.395
- Alex Longshadow.
- Oh, 'kay.

06:56.430 --> 06:58.531
Mr. Sanchez, if you
would do us the honor...

06:58.565 --> 07:00.767
a few shots with the
casino in the background.

07:00.801 --> 07:04.403
- Man, of... come on, man, of course.
- Right this way.

07:04.438 --> 07:07.340
Mr. Proctor,
Douglas Dern, Damien's manager.

07:07.375 --> 07:09.575
- We spoke on the phone.
- We did. Pleasure to meet you.

07:09.610 --> 07:12.779
You said the place was old.
You didn't say ancient.

07:12.813 --> 07:16.316
The Kinaho feel a powerful
connection to their past.

07:16.350 --> 07:20.020
<i>In the case of the Kinaho Moon,
a little too powerful, in my opinion.</i>

07:20.054 --> 07:21.888
I would have preferred to
have the new casino built

07:21.922 --> 07:27.160
before we hosted Mr. Sanchez,
but rest assured the money is real.

07:27.195 --> 07:30.264
Yeah, it had better be.

07:30.299 --> 07:33.001
<i>He's gonna look worse soon, I promise.</i>

07:34.603 --> 07:38.572
<i>Nice casino. Not bad.</i>

07:40.408 --> 07:42.843
<i>Not bad at all.</i>

07:49.751 --> 07:51.185
There it is, baby.

07:51.219 --> 07:54.388
<i>- That's where I do my thing.
- This way, Mr. Sanchez.</i>

07:58.226 --> 08:00.495
You don't approve.

08:03.332 --> 08:06.735
The hotel... the revenue it will
earn should be for our people.

08:06.769 --> 08:08.270
We shouldn't be including
a man like Proctor.

08:08.304 --> 08:13.108
A man like that
gets things done quickly.

08:13.142 --> 08:17.979
We're building something that will
sustain our tribe for years to come.

08:20.082 --> 08:25.186
When I go to the spirits,
I want to have seen the start of it all.

09:17.107 --> 09:19.809
Are you sure you wouldn't prefer
a hotel? It's just a quick call.

09:19.844 --> 09:21.770
I can have you in
the presidential suite.

09:21.771 --> 09:24.481
No, no, no.
My trailer goes wherever I go.

09:24.515 --> 09:26.650
I don't like to be too
pampered before a fight.

09:26.684 --> 09:28.718
Besides, there'll be
plenty of time for that

09:28.753 --> 09:30.620
after I put Hollister's noose up there.

09:30.655 --> 09:33.023
As agreed.

09:34.759 --> 09:36.660
Thank you.

09:39.430 --> 09:40.831
I think I like this town.

09:40.866 --> 09:43.301
We also made some
improvements on your bedroom.

11:07.320 --> 11:12.091
Gordon.
Hi, Deva.

11:12.125 --> 11:15.027
It's a pretty tough day for everyone.

11:15.062 --> 11:17.062
Yep.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.369
Say, why don't you join
us for dinner tonight?

11:23.403 --> 11:26.238
Nothing fancy; I'm just gonna grill
out some burgers in the back yard.

11:26.272 --> 11:31.744
- Oh, honey, you know...
- That sounds great. Thanks, Gordon.

11:32.746 --> 11:34.180
Why don't we say about 6:00?

11:34.214 --> 11:36.916
- Sure. See you there.
- Good.

11:44.257 --> 11:46.325
So, how do you like
your burger, Sheriff?

11:46.360 --> 11:48.494
Medium rare, thanks.

11:50.897 --> 11:52.931
- Can I see your gun?
- Yeah, sure.

11:52.966 --> 11:56.401
No. Thank you.
You don't need to see his gun.

11:56.435 --> 11:59.337
Hey, hon', why don't you
grab the Sheriff another beer?

11:59.371 --> 12:01.639
I'll get it, Mom.

12:01.674 --> 12:04.242
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

12:09.748 --> 12:10.915
Here you go.

12:10.949 --> 12:13.484
- Thank you.
- Yep.

12:16.388 --> 12:18.890
So, Deva, how are you doing?

12:20.793 --> 12:25.797
I don't know.
I still can't believe it.

12:25.832 --> 12:28.300
Yeah. It takes some time.

12:30.436 --> 12:34.640
- Deva, honey, would you go get...
- Yeah. Hold on, Maxie.

12:38.812 --> 12:41.113
Nice and deep, bubba.

12:42.949 --> 12:44.650
You okay?

12:44.684 --> 12:46.919
That's the way.

12:48.054 --> 12:49.888
<i> You good?</i>

12:54.995 --> 12:56.095
What's wrong with him?

12:56.129 --> 12:58.531
It's been happening
since he was a toddler.

13:00.133 --> 13:04.870
- Is he... is he okay?
- He has good days and bad days.

13:11.245 --> 13:13.996
Hey, Max,
why don't you go ahead

13:13.997 --> 13:17.783
and touch the gun
just for a second?

13:22.322 --> 13:23.458
Yeah.

13:29.162 --> 13:31.731
<i> You know, Sheriff,
we never got a chance</i>

13:31.732 --> 13:34.300
<i>to thank you for pulling Deva
out of that mess the other night.</i>

13:34.335 --> 13:38.338
Aw. So how
did the arraignments go?

13:38.372 --> 13:41.441
Well, all the men you arrested
identified this guy Hanson,

13:41.475 --> 13:42.943
<i>but apparently he's long gone.</i>

13:42.977 --> 13:45.745
<i>And either they don't
know or won't talk about</i>

13:45.780 --> 13:49.616
<i>where the skulls came from.
It's not that I can't guess.</i>

13:49.650 --> 13:52.553
Whores, gambling, drugs.

13:52.587 --> 13:54.721
All crooked roads in
Banshee lead to one man,

13:54.756 --> 13:56.857
and that's Kai Proctor.

14:01.262 --> 14:06.299
- I'll get us some more drinks, eh?
- Great.

14:13.808 --> 14:16.943
- Alone at last.
- Shut up.

14:20.147 --> 14:22.248
What happened?

14:25.552 --> 14:27.120
Heavy bag workout.

14:28.655 --> 14:33.660
Mm, not unless it was a bag of bones.

14:40.368 --> 14:43.238
Ana...

14:43.272 --> 14:48.844
- it's me.
- Mm, no, you're different.

14:48.879 --> 14:50.279
How?

14:52.583 --> 14:54.951
You used to be kind.

15:00.625 --> 15:03.360
You know...

15:03.394 --> 15:07.297
you get locked up,
forgotten about for 15 years,

15:07.331 --> 15:08.598
see how kind you feel after that.

15:08.633 --> 15:12.135
- Now, I know you're angry, but...
- Angry?

15:12.169 --> 15:14.404
You have no fuckin' idea.

15:23.614 --> 15:25.282
<i> Hey, where are you going?</i>

15:25.316 --> 15:28.285
Uh, I got a call.
Thanks for the food.

15:58.682 --> 16:02.185
Look, um,

18:11.214 --> 18:12.982
Don't you think you're
getting a little too old

18:13.016 --> 18:15.618
for this rebel streak of yours?

18:19.391 --> 18:21.859
That's rich coming from you.

18:25.831 --> 18:30.735
Whatever you may think,
my choices have cost me dearly.

18:30.769 --> 18:34.572
Yeah. You're really hurting.

18:35.875 --> 18:38.876
My mother lives just
10 miles away from me.

18:38.911 --> 18:42.046
I haven't seen or spoken
to her in over 20 years.

18:42.113 --> 18:46.150
My father, when I run into him,
won't even fucking look at me.

18:46.184 --> 18:49.954
My sister, your mother,
denies I even exist.

18:49.988 --> 18:53.157
Yeah, well, that's why
they call it being shunned.

18:53.192 --> 18:55.359
<i>Show some respect!</i>

18:58.831 --> 19:01.199
<i>I'm sorry, Uncle.</i>

19:02.701 --> 19:05.970
You can't begin to
understand how alone I am.

19:06.005 --> 19:08.439
I've lost count of the people I hurt,

19:08.474 --> 19:12.076
and still I hurt people every day.

19:14.113 --> 19:17.448
You have no idea what
that does to you inside.

19:20.052 --> 19:25.123
It's like a blade in your belly
that has gradually scraped you raw.

19:26.292 --> 19:28.827
I'm not buying it, Uncle.

19:28.861 --> 19:35.335
You have everything you've
ever wanted. You're free.

19:38.206 --> 19:41.475
Why don't you just admit
that you like being bad?

19:48.251 --> 19:54.056
Do you realize
no one else can talk to me like that?

19:54.091 --> 19:59.329
You're the only person who
isn't scared of me. The only one.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.349

21:29.453 --> 21:31.554
You just came in to see him train?

21:31.588 --> 21:34.223
No. Actually, I came to see you.

21:35.726 --> 21:38.894
You heard about the
Schumacher boy OD'ing, right?

21:40.030 --> 21:43.833
Yeah, I did. It's terrible.

21:46.337 --> 21:51.074
Proctor, you told me you had a talent
for resolving problems here in Banshee.

21:53.311 --> 21:56.012
I was kind of hoping you
could help me with this one.

21:57.448 --> 22:00.285
I found these
in the dead boy's pocket.

22:01.387 --> 22:06.157
The kids call them "skulls."
You ever seen pills like that before?

22:06.191 --> 22:08.626
Are you asking me or accusing me?

22:08.660 --> 22:11.262
Why, I'm asking you, Kai.

22:12.464 --> 22:14.098
Just don't play games with me, Sheriff.

22:14.132 --> 22:15.966
I'm well aware of
Mayor Kendall's agenda.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.734
Oh, this has nothing to do with Kendall.

22:17.769 --> 22:20.270
The boy means well, but he's an idiot.

22:20.305 --> 22:25.041
On that at least I'm sure we can agree.
So if you'll excuse me...

22:26.844 --> 22:29.278
I'm busy trying to bring
good things to Banshee.

22:31.014 --> 22:32.847
Thanks for your time.

22:47.496 --> 22:50.197
- Asshole.
- What?

22:50.232 --> 22:52.700
You gotta watch me.
If you blink, it's over.

22:52.734 --> 22:56.003
He didn't have to hit him that
hard. They're just sparring.

22:59.274 --> 23:01.409
<i> Damn, I'm out of partners.</i>

23:01.443 --> 23:03.544
<i> Right here!
Sarge will take you on!</i>

23:05.948 --> 23:07.748
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

23:07.783 --> 23:11.819
Ahem. 5-0.
Yeah, Sheriff.

23:13.021 --> 23:14.755
You want a shot at the title?

23:18.293 --> 23:19.894
Huh?
You can't throw a few punches?

23:27.036 --> 23:30.104
Go easy on him.
I'd be scared of me, too.

23:30.138 --> 23:32.239
<i> You're the champ!</i>

23:32.274 --> 23:33.507
<i> The Sheriff too smart.</i>

23:33.542 --> 23:36.844
He don't wanna step in the ring.
He don't want none of this.

23:42.183 --> 23:44.218
Excuse me, excuse me.

23:44.252 --> 23:45.886
<i>Hey. Can you come here?</i>

23:45.920 --> 23:47.488
Hey, hey. Hey, doll.

23:47.522 --> 23:50.023
- How you doing? What's your name?
- Chloe.

23:50.058 --> 23:52.526
Hey, um, Chloe, can you bring
me a bottle of champagne?

23:52.560 --> 23:56.229
- Sure. I'll be right back.
- No, doll.

23:56.264 --> 23:59.432
Can you bring it to my trailer?
Say, tonight around 11:00?

24:05.105 --> 24:08.207
- All right, Mr. Sanchez.
- All right, Chloe.

24:08.242 --> 24:09.776
<i>All right.</i>

24:14.982 --> 24:18.418
Come on in.

24:20.688 --> 24:24.092
Hmm.
Must be 11:00.

25:06.167 --> 25:08.502
<i>They're all there.</i>

25:13.108 --> 25:17.846
Just take them and go.
You can start a new life somewhere.

25:19.316 --> 25:22.518
You deserve that after
everything you've been through.

25:37.902 --> 25:43.073
You think you can buy me off? Huh?

25:43.108 --> 25:48.780
You listen to me.
I'm not going anywhere.

25:48.814 --> 25:52.450
So take your fuckin'
diamonds and get out.

26:21.813 --> 26:26.751
- You want a bump?
- I never have.

26:31.157 --> 26:32.791
I'll try.

26:34.261 --> 26:36.229
Yeah, fuck me harder.

26:37.698 --> 26:39.166
No, no, no, no.

26:39.200 --> 26:42.836
No, doll, no. Not like that.

26:42.871 --> 26:45.005
Like this.

26:50.546 --> 26:52.481
You like it like that?

26:59.588 --> 27:02.057
Fuck me harder!

27:19.708 --> 27:21.609
Ah, you're hurting me.

27:25.247 --> 27:28.249
No! Get off me!

27:28.283 --> 27:32.353
- Don't!
- Shut the fuck up!

27:39.862 --> 27:42.764
- Fucking bitch!
- Ah!

27:51.040 --> 27:52.541
Oh, my head!

28:01.285 --> 28:05.621
We have combed the entire building,
reviewed all security footage.

28:05.655 --> 28:11.593
- She left absolutely nothing behind.
- But she came.

28:11.627 --> 28:15.796
She walked right into the lion's den.

28:16.965 --> 28:20.000
He has become a threat to her.

28:21.236 --> 28:27.674
He has been locked up for 15 years.
He's sick with love.

28:27.709 --> 28:33.014
He is reckless.
And rusty.

28:34.082 --> 28:36.183
He'll make a mistake.

28:37.085 --> 28:42.090
He already did.
He scared her.

28:48.798 --> 28:51.032
I thought this was your day off.

28:52.468 --> 28:55.236
I don't have much of a social life.

28:58.841 --> 29:04.613
Do you miss being home?
You don't really talk about it.

29:08.852 --> 29:11.487
It must be hard coming to
a new town not knowing anyone.

29:12.824 --> 29:15.892
I'm used to being alone.

29:20.398 --> 29:23.166
I'll never get used to it.

29:42.717 --> 29:44.551
- Sheriff.
- Yeah.

29:44.585 --> 29:46.219
You need to get over to the hospital.

29:48.856 --> 29:53.827
<i>Chloe, I'm so sorry
I have to ask these questions.</i>

29:55.861 --> 29:58.365
<i>I'm almost done, okay?</i>

29:58.399 --> 29:59.900
So you and Mr. Sanchez...

29:59.967 --> 30:03.304
<i>being in bed together was consensual?</i>

30:04.673 --> 30:07.041
Until it got rough.

30:08.878 --> 30:10.813
I did something wrong
and he just...

30:10.847 --> 30:14.082
Chloe, look at me.

30:14.117 --> 30:17.319
You did nothing wrong, okay?

30:19.756 --> 30:22.925
He kicked me
and then he punched me.

30:22.959 --> 30:25.394
I was crawling.
I was trying to get away,

30:25.429 --> 30:28.030
<i>but he...
he wouldn't let...</i>

30:28.064 --> 30:32.668
then he...
took the champagne bottle...

30:35.772 --> 30:37.473
<i> Okay.</i>

30:38.642 --> 30:41.210
I'm gonna go talk to your nurse, okay?

31:06.903 --> 31:09.305
Hey, hey, hey.
We've got nothing.

31:09.339 --> 31:11.341
Even the overflow lot is filled.

31:11.375 --> 31:14.477
You're gonna wanna
try down the way... hey!

31:18.516 --> 31:20.450
Found a spot.

31:35.934 --> 31:38.203
Oh, crap.

31:40.739 --> 31:42.673
Sheriff Hood.

31:44.677 --> 31:47.945
I've heard about the girl.
How is she?

31:47.980 --> 31:50.448
Well, she looks like
she was hit by a train.

31:50.482 --> 31:52.450
I know this is a delicate situation,

31:52.484 --> 31:54.886
but I'm going to ask you
to arrest Sanchez

31:54.920 --> 31:56.354
after the fight tomorrow night.

31:56.388 --> 31:58.590
- What?
- Yeah, I know how it sounds,

31:58.624 --> 32:01.560
but Banshee
needs this fight to happen.

32:01.594 --> 32:04.018
Too many people and businesses
stand to lose if it doesn't.

32:04.019 --> 32:05.773
Are you out of your mind?!
That girl...

32:05.774 --> 32:07.299
Hey, hey, Deputy, give us a minute.

32:07.334 --> 32:09.034
- You're actually gonna discuss this...
- Hey, hey, hey.

32:09.069 --> 32:11.036
- You saw what he did to that girl.
- Calm down right now.

32:11.071 --> 32:14.507
Are you just another one of
Proctor's yes-men now? Is that it?

32:14.541 --> 32:17.377
"Meet the new boss,
same as the old boss."

32:21.149 --> 32:26.053
Sheriff, I just wanted to thank you
for your discretion.

32:26.087 --> 32:27.954
These things can always be handled.

32:27.988 --> 32:31.591
"These things"?
So this has happened before?

32:31.625 --> 32:34.760
You know the deal...
tomorrow I'll go visit the girl.

32:34.795 --> 32:37.062
She'll put on a show, but ultimately,

32:37.097 --> 32:39.231
it always comes down to the
number they had in their mind

32:39.265 --> 32:40.866
from the moment they
decided to fuck him.

32:40.900 --> 32:43.001
- Yeah? Dern, right?
- Yeah.

32:43.036 --> 32:46.338
Yeah, you need to go somewhere
I can't see you and stay there.

32:46.372 --> 32:49.006
Hey, I mean, come on...

32:49.041 --> 32:52.443
- Hood.
- Hey, hey.

33:02.389 --> 33:03.756
5-0, that was not cool.

33:03.790 --> 33:05.858
Benny was just doing his
job, man. What the fuck?

33:05.892 --> 33:09.361
You're under arrest
for rape and aggravated assault.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.801
I'm under arrest?

33:18.238 --> 33:22.942
Okay. Yeah, I'm under arrest.
All right, yeah.

33:22.976 --> 33:24.810
Come and get me.

33:29.750 --> 33:32.018
Sheriff.

33:37.192 --> 33:38.759
Sheriff.

33:44.600 --> 33:47.735
Gotta watch me.

33:47.770 --> 33:51.372
That is cute. I like that.

33:52.607 --> 33:54.708
Looks like you're not
too smart after all.

33:55.710 --> 33:59.346
This what you wanna do?

33:59.381 --> 34:02.216
Ladies and gentlemen, amateur hour.

34:02.284 --> 34:04.853
Let's go.

34:34.884 --> 34:37.119
<i> Come on, Sheriff, let's go.</i>

34:51.502 --> 34:53.603
Get up, bitch!

35:02.346 --> 35:05.315
Get out of my way. Move! Move.

35:05.383 --> 35:07.184
Hood.

35:31.607 --> 35:33.775
Get the fuck off of me.

35:35.877 --> 35:38.078
Come on, Champ.

36:20.153 --> 36:22.221
Fuck.

36:23.490 --> 36:27.628
You like hitting little girls?
Huh?

36:41.177 --> 36:43.678
You motherfucker!

36:54.424 --> 36:56.725
Oh. my God!

37:17.279 --> 37:19.613
<i> Hood, enough!</i>

38:16.704 --> 38:19.106
Meet the new boss.

38:24.379 --> 38:26.413
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

38:26.448 --> 38:29.316
<i>Anything you say or do can and
will be held against you in...</i>

38:31.552 --> 38:36.757
<i>Sugar here. Come on.
I got you.</i>

38:36.791 --> 38:42.329
<i>All right.
Let's walk, hmm? All right.</i>

38:42.363 --> 38:43.863
So you're just the kind of guy

38:43.898 --> 38:46.266
who makes friends wherever he goes, huh?

38:46.300 --> 38:48.634
Yeah, it's all right.

38:55.110 --> 38:58.245
- Shit.
- Just open the door.

39:11.325 --> 39:15.696
Whoa. I always wanted
to drive one of these.

39:19.467 --> 39:22.403
You cost me a referee
gig tonight, brother.

39:22.438 --> 39:25.373
And I could have used the scratch.

39:36.921 --> 39:41.759
Ha. All righty.
Here we go.

40:56.737 --> 40:59.439

- He in there?

40:59.473 --> 41:03.710
<i>Yeah, but he's not fit for a visit.</i>

41:03.744 --> 41:05.312
<i> So now you're his gatekeeper?</i>

41:05.379 --> 41:08.315
It's okay, Sugar.

41:14.756 --> 41:16.892
It's all right.

41:16.926 --> 41:19.428
You cost a lot of people
a lot of money tonight.

41:19.463 --> 41:21.631
You cost me a lot of money tonight.

41:22.967 --> 41:25.134
Why don't you take it up with Sanchez?

41:30.841 --> 41:34.344
Can I help you with
something, Mr. Proctor?

41:36.914 --> 41:40.484
I always had very good
relations with your predecessors.

41:40.518 --> 41:43.020
Yeah, you bought them.

41:44.789 --> 41:48.625
Sometimes laws need to be bent
or broken for the greater good.

41:48.659 --> 41:50.627
I know you agree with that.

41:50.661 --> 41:53.530
No. No,
you know nothing about me.

41:53.564 --> 41:57.200
Well, clearly not as much as I should.

41:57.235 --> 41:59.269
There's a lot you don't know as well.

41:59.303 --> 42:03.307
My family's been here for 160 years.

42:03.341 --> 42:08.112
I've lived here my entire life.
I am this town.

42:08.146 --> 42:11.448
I helped build it and I bled for it.

42:12.717 --> 42:14.918
Have you ever loved anything like that?

42:16.721 --> 42:19.189
I have.

42:24.595 --> 42:27.864
You see, people here
don't always approve

42:27.898 --> 42:29.565
of the way I go about things.

42:29.600 --> 42:32.635
But from what I've
seen since you got here,

42:32.669 --> 42:34.804
you're not very different
from me in that regard.

42:34.838 --> 42:39.140
So what puzzles me is why you
seem to hold me in such contempt.

42:41.477 --> 42:45.447
I have no contempt for you.

42:45.481 --> 42:50.786
I'm just not afraid of you.
I think maybe you're not used to that.

42:51.854 --> 42:54.990
See, you call yourself a businessman

42:55.025 --> 42:57.359
and you dress well, you speak well,

42:57.394 --> 43:00.429
but you're still
nothing but a petty thug.

43:00.464 --> 43:03.600
You've been doing it so long,
you actually think it makes sense

43:03.634 --> 43:05.601
to show up here in
the middle of the night

43:05.636 --> 43:09.139
and ask me why you can't own
me like you own everyone else.

43:10.174 --> 43:17.147
That makes you delusional,
which makes you dangerous.

43:17.181 --> 43:20.550
Why would I want to get
in bed with someone like that?

43:23.087 --> 43:28.158
Sheriff, do you know
why they're afraid of me?

43:28.192 --> 43:30.961
Why is that?

43:32.196 --> 43:34.931
Because they should be.

43:39.905 --> 43:42.274
And maybe you should be, too.

43:42.308 --> 43:47.312
Why don't you show me why right now?

43:51.117 --> 43:56.521
Nah.
I haven't given up on you just yet.

44:00.993 --> 44:03.528
You have a good night.

44:07.733 --> 44:10.568
<i>You're not
understanding me. He's done.</i>

44:10.603 --> 44:14.005
He's done permanently!

44:14.039 --> 44:17.241
The Sheriff fucked him up really bad.

44:17.276 --> 44:20.578
I wouldn't have believed it
if I hadn't seen it myself.

44:21.814 --> 44:24.449
No, look, look.
They already arrested him.

44:24.484 --> 44:26.051
I'm cutting my fuckin' losses.

44:26.085 --> 44:28.754
I never should've come
to this jerkwater town.

44:28.788 --> 44:30.155
I gotta call you back.

44:30.190 --> 44:32.858
- Mr. Dern.
- I'm a little busy here.

44:32.926 --> 44:34.927
I imagine so.
I won't waste your time.

44:34.961 --> 44:39.198
- I'm here to pick up the satchel.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

44:40.467 --> 44:42.000
You were paid an
agreed-upon sum of cash

44:42.035 --> 44:43.935
to deliver the fight to the Kinaho Moon.

44:43.970 --> 44:47.505
Clearly, the fight is off.
And while Mr. Proctor does not hold

44:47.540 --> 44:51.709
Mr. Sanchez's reckless
behavior against you personally,

44:51.743 --> 44:54.712
he does expect his money
to be returned.

44:59.484 --> 45:02.752
Well, listen to me, little man.

45:02.787 --> 45:05.254
Proctor assured me that
he'd buy us enough time

45:05.289 --> 45:08.625
to pay off that little skank, so
he's the one that didn't come through.

45:08.659 --> 45:12.495
And as far as the money, tell him
it's the cost of doing business.

45:12.529 --> 45:16.799
And if he knows what's good
for him, he'll leave it at that.

45:16.834 --> 45:18.401
Now I'm gonna go finish packing...

45:18.435 --> 45:21.871
so I can get the fuck out
of this shithole!

45:45.796 --> 45:47.597
<i>Hey, what are
you doing here, asshole?</i>

45:47.631 --> 45:51.000
<i>I told you...
what the fuck is that?</i>

45:51.034 --> 45:53.669
<i>Hey, wait. Now, now, don't.
Come on. Just back off.</i>

45:53.703 --> 45:56.639
<i>Hey...</i>

45:56.673 --> 46:00.976
<i>Don't!</i>
