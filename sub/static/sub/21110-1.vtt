00:11.279 --> 00:11.645
Hey mom.

00:11.679 --> 00:12.713
Hi, sweetie.

00:12.746 --> 00:13.781
You excited?

00:13.814 --> 00:15.783
Yes, I am.

00:15.816 --> 00:16.717
A little nervous.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.653
I never thought we'd be staging
our house.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.622
Yeah, I know, right?

00:23.624 --> 00:25.259
You ok?

00:25.293 --> 00:26.260
Yeah.

00:26.294 --> 00:30.164
It's just... are you sure
about all of this?

00:30.198 --> 00:32.366
You know I think Mick
is amazing,

00:32.400 --> 00:35.236
but these are huge changes
you're talking about.

00:35.269 --> 00:39.273
Plus, you're a type A, and
I'm pretty sure he's a type B.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.374
Or C.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.477
Aren't you the one
who told me to jump in?

00:43.511 --> 00:45.513
I meant put a toe in.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.747
Test the waters.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.817
Not put your house up for sale
and give away your business.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.286
Honey, this house is way
too big for me now

00:52.320 --> 00:55.523
and I'm giving my business
to you, ok?

00:55.556 --> 00:57.391
I'm ready for a new chapter.

00:57.425 --> 00:58.292
Is he?

00:58.326 --> 00:59.427
I'll see when I get there.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.563
So you haven't
told him everything.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.298
I will though, in person.

01:04.331 --> 01:05.166
Mom.

01:05.199 --> 01:08.769
Honey, everything is gonna
be great.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.271
I promise.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.672
I know.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.742
I'm just really gonna miss you.

01:14.775 --> 01:18.346
Awe, I'm gonna miss you, too.

01:19.247 --> 01:19.880
Hey.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.782
Let's get this thing staged.

01:21.815 --> 01:22.616
Ok.

01:23.717 --> 01:28.189
I think we should move the couch
to face the window.

01:28.222 --> 01:30.724
Oh. I was- I was thinking
opposite.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.527
We reverse it,
put the couch there,

01:33.561 --> 01:34.495
love seat there,

01:34.528 --> 01:36.330
coffee table here.

01:36.364 --> 01:37.265
Mom?

01:37.298 --> 01:37.898
Hmm?

01:37.931 --> 01:40.368
You're taking over again.

01:40.401 --> 01:41.135
You're right.

01:41.169 --> 01:43.337
Couch facing
the window it is.

01:43.371 --> 01:43.904
Trust me.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.473
I know what I'm doing.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.711
You guys about ready
to warm up?

01:50.744 --> 01:51.412
Yeah.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.246
Yeah.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.181
Alright.

01:53.214 --> 01:53.781
You and me, huh?

01:53.814 --> 01:54.615
Chorus.

01:54.648 --> 01:55.416
Two.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.317
Three.

01:56.350 --> 01:56.884

Feelin' good.

02:13.767 --> 02:14.602
Yes.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.605
Last show on the Dive Bar
Tour, pal.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.272
It's been great.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.373
It's been like the old days.

02:19.407 --> 02:20.274
Yeah.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.843
So, what's the plan?

02:22.876 --> 02:24.378
Well, I'm gonna head back
to the Inn,

02:24.412 --> 02:27.781
fluff up some pillows and
hang up the "open" sign.

02:27.815 --> 02:28.949
Yeah, I kinda meant
with Olivia.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.218
Oh, she's in New York.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.319
She's just tying up
some loose ends.

02:31.352 --> 02:34.922
You know, we talk, FaceTime,
text almost every day.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.290
She's coming to the Inn
this weekend.

02:36.324 --> 02:36.690
Oh yeah?

02:36.724 --> 02:37.458
Yeah.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.158
For how long?

02:38.192 --> 02:38.992
I don't know. It's open-ended.

02:39.026 --> 02:40.728
We're sorta just playing it
by ear,

02:40.761 --> 02:42.396
pick up where we left off.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.731
Right.

02:43.764 --> 02:44.765
Why? What?

02:44.798 --> 02:46.767
Well, it's jus the last time
she was at the Inn

02:46.800 --> 02:48.536
you did break up a wedding.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.438
Uh, yeah, I remember.

02:52.039 --> 02:55.409
Look, Mick, I think you guys
are great together,

02:55.443 --> 02:56.210
I really do.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.745
And I love Olivia,
you know that.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.281
But have you really
thought this thing through?

03:00.314 --> 03:00.881
What's there to think through?

03:00.914 --> 03:01.882
It's Olivia.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.116
We've known each other forever.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.586
I'm just saying you've been
on your own a long time, pal.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.256
But you know what?

03:08.289 --> 03:09.122
It's gonna be great.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.524
This is our last show,
let's kill it.

03:10.558 --> 03:10.924
Come on.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.226
Ok.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.503
♪ I'm gonna drive
with Miss Daisy, ♪

03:23.404 --> 03:26.440
♪ I'm gonna ride
with Miss Daisy, ♪

03:27.908 --> 03:31.345
♪ I'm gonna fly
with Miss Daisy, ♪

03:32.413 --> 03:36.484
♪ I'm gonna cry
with Miss Daisy, ♪

03:36.517 --> 03:39.587
♪ I'm gonna ride
with Miss Daisy, ♪

04:56.797 --> 04:58.599
It's the newest thing.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.669
It's called The Matrimony
Resort.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.070
They have everything we need
for the wedding

05:03.103 --> 05:05.473
so you don't have to worry
about a thing.

05:05.506 --> 05:08.842
Somehow I think you might
still worry a little.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.511
Maybe.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.612
A little.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.881
But it takes so much
off our plate,

05:13.914 --> 05:16.417
and I know you want to keep
things simple.

05:17.418 --> 05:20.621
Oh, look at them.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.922
They're perfect.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.826
Is there anything better
than a wedding?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.695
Uh, the basketball playoffs?

05:27.728 --> 05:29.630
At least you didn't
say "root canal".

05:29.663 --> 05:30.564
I was thinking it.

05:30.598 --> 05:31.765
Ha ha.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.300
You know what, though?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.735
You know what's even better
than a wedding?

05:35.869 --> 05:36.937
A marriage.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.606
Awe.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.377
You're right.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.513
It's just a day.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.382
The most important day
of our lives.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.452
Come on, let's go in.

05:51.485 --> 05:54.555
You're going to love this place,
I promise.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.889
Ok.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.498
They have several weddings
here a day,

06:04.532 --> 06:06.700
so we're gonna have to book
in as soon as we can

06:06.734 --> 06:09.670
if you like it, which
I know you will...

06:12.039 --> 06:13.707
Wow.

06:13.741 --> 06:16.510
Helene and Wes got married
here last month.

06:16.544 --> 06:17.745
What, your cousin Helene?

06:17.778 --> 06:19.012
Mmmhmm.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.515
Didn't that get annulled?

06:21.549 --> 06:26.620
Yes, but the wedding
was amazing.

06:26.654 --> 06:27.688
Cucumber water?

06:27.721 --> 06:28.956
Thank you.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.091
I love cucumber water.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.059
I'm ok, thank you.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.894
I had some cucumber
in my salad last night.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.496
Ok.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.098
I know it's big.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.167
It's bigger than
we talked about

06:40.200 --> 06:42.803
but it gives us more options.

06:42.836 --> 06:46.173
And just wait until you see
the wedding pavilion.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.808
And the ballroom.

06:47.841 --> 06:48.876
And the ballroom.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.945
Hey, everybody.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.814
It's almost summer.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.215
We're open for business.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.686
Got any friends
getting married?

07:00.087 --> 07:03.156
Ok, stale breadcrumbs
on the way.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.658
Talking to the ducks again?

07:04.692 --> 07:05.926
Julie!

07:05.959 --> 07:07.695
Hey!

07:07.728 --> 07:09.863
I thought I was picking you up
at the train.

07:09.897 --> 07:10.764
I caught a ride.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.501
My final ended early
and yes I aced it.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.768
I'm so proud of you, honey.

07:14.802 --> 07:15.669
Thanks, dad.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.070
Likewise, how was
the end of the tour?

07:17.104 --> 07:19.106
Oh, it was uh...
it was good, good.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.941
I uh, got you a t-shirt.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.076
I'm not wearing a t-shirt
with my dad's picture.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.679
Yeah, I guess that would be
kind of embarrassing, huh?

07:25.713 --> 07:26.213
Kinda.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.515
I'll get your bags.

07:27.548 --> 07:30.217
Someone's bringing them,
actually.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.785
The word is "boyfriend".

07:31.819 --> 07:32.953
Mr. Turner.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.822
I've heard so much
about you.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.090
Dad, this is Wyatt.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.559
He's a hospitality major
at State.

07:38.592 --> 07:39.693
Isn't that great?

07:39.727 --> 07:40.628
Yeah.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.096
I'm still stuck on
the word "boyfriend".

07:43.130 --> 07:45.098
This place is fantastic.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.701
Seeing as the season's
starting up

07:47.735 --> 07:50.638
I was hoping you could give
Wyatt a summer job at the Inn.

07:50.671 --> 07:51.805
I'm happy to start
at the bottom.

07:51.839 --> 07:52.806
I'll do anything.

07:52.840 --> 07:53.874
Or nothing.

07:53.907 --> 07:54.742
Or everything?

07:54.775 --> 07:55.976
Well, that's very nice
of you but uh,

07:56.009 --> 07:58.746
unfortunately we're in a bit
of a hiring freeze right now.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.781
You may wanna try the place
down the road.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.949
The place we passed
on the way in?

08:01.982 --> 08:02.783
Yeah.

08:02.816 --> 08:03.717
Otherwise known
as "the Inn killer".

08:03.751 --> 08:05.853
If you don't mind me asking,
Mr. Turner,

08:05.886 --> 08:07.888
are you open all year?

08:07.921 --> 08:09.523
No. Just the summer.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.224
Memorial Day through
Labour Day.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.359
It never changes.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.294
You know, statistically
establishments that stay open

08:14.327 --> 08:16.730
through the off season
show a better OPR.

08:16.764 --> 08:17.364
OPR?

08:17.397 --> 08:19.032
Occupancy to profit ratio.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.969
Isn't he amazing?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.203
Amazing.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.038
I'll let my board of
directors know.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.576
I'll get the stuff
from the car.

08:29.777 --> 08:30.210
What is this?

08:30.243 --> 08:31.812
Dad, dad.

08:31.845 --> 08:32.780
Please.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.315
Listen, there's...

08:35.347 --> 08:36.316
there's something I gotta
talk to you about.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.619
I didn't wanna bother you
with it at school,

08:38.652 --> 08:40.888
but uh, we're in a little slump
around here.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.222
I know summer bookings are down
but it'll pick up.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.758
We're almost in June.

08:44.792 --> 08:47.227
That other place is syphoning
all the business.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.028
It's just one place.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.197
How many weddings can they
put on?

08:50.230 --> 08:52.633
How about all of them?

08:52.666 --> 08:55.302
So I, uh, I've been talking
to a broker.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.536
You're selling the Inn?

08:56.570 --> 09:00.040
No, I'm looking for an investor
and someone's made an offer.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.108
An investor?

09:01.141 --> 09:03.310
Yeah. It would be more like
a partner, I guess.

09:03.343 --> 09:04.578
A silent partner.

09:04.612 --> 09:05.613
How silent?

09:05.646 --> 09:06.647
Well, they would put up
the money

09:06.680 --> 09:08.849
and I'd still run the place
like I always do.

09:08.882 --> 09:09.883
Well, who is it?

09:09.917 --> 09:10.751
I don't know yet.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.353
We're gonna meet
and see if it's a fit.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.988
That's great.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.123
I guess.

09:16.156 --> 09:19.660
It's just... you've been
running this place a long time

09:19.693 --> 09:22.229
and you do kind of like
to have things your way.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.163
Yes, I do.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.297
And I still will.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.933
And Wyatt, let me show you

09:25.966 --> 09:29.002
one of my statistically
unoccupied rooms.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.270
Thanks, Mr. Turner.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.905
Where are you gonna put him,
dad?

09:31.939 --> 09:33.807
As far away from your room
as possible.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.809
It's not in the lake, is it?

09:35.843 --> 09:36.977
Not yet.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.287
Hey.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.056
I was just gonna call you.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.124
Oh, good timing.

09:51.158 --> 09:51.959
Yeah.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.360
How was the last show?

09:53.393 --> 09:55.128
Uh, good, good.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.096
Good crowd.

09:56.129 --> 09:56.897
Good.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.765
Good to hear.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.667
How's everything going
with you um...

09:59.700 --> 10:02.235
uh, getting packed with
the house and everything?

10:02.269 --> 10:05.338
Yeah, I- I'm all packed up.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.707
Good.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.108
Well, I can't wait
to see you.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.377
Yeah, me too.

10:10.410 --> 10:14.882
Um, hey, there's just something
I wanna mention.

10:14.915 --> 10:15.883
Ok.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.290
Uh... how's the weather?

10:23.323 --> 10:25.025
Nice.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.226
It's... good.

10:26.259 --> 10:29.062
Ok then, I'll see you tomorrow.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.630
Okey dokey.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.035
How's the weather?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.638
Okey dokey?

10:46.179 --> 10:47.180
Hey, dad.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.281
Where is he?

10:48.315 --> 10:50.250
That's the first thing
you have to say?

10:50.283 --> 10:50.984
Hi, honey.

10:51.018 --> 10:51.685
Where is he?

10:51.719 --> 10:54.021
He's outside fixing the bikes.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.422
What is this?

10:55.455 --> 10:57.424
Are you planning
some romantic dinner?

10:57.457 --> 10:59.927
Yes, for you and Olivia.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.228
Oh, honey, you don't have to-

11:01.261 --> 11:02.062
We need to go all out.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.764
You haven't seen her
in two months.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.465
Actually it's five weeks
and three days.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.300
She came to the Rooster Shack
show in Newark.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.301
Ok.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.302
That's dedication.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.070
You think?

11:10.103 --> 11:10.503
Yeah.

11:10.537 --> 11:11.404
And I'm cooking.

11:11.438 --> 11:12.305
What's her favourite dish?

11:12.339 --> 11:14.274
Uh... pizza.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.076
And that was, what,
in college?

11:16.109 --> 11:18.178
I don't know,
call it Italian food.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.248
She could have gone
gluten free or be a vegetarian

11:21.281 --> 11:22.182
for all I know.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.450
I know she's allergic to roses.

11:23.483 --> 11:24.918
You're nervous.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.186
That is so cute.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.687
I'm not nervous.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.290
I am nervous, aren't I?

11:30.323 --> 11:31.191
I'm completely nervous.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.192
Look at me. I'm a mess.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.493
Change is good, right?

11:33.526 --> 11:34.895
That's what you always
tell me.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.229
I have no idea what I tell you.

11:36.263 --> 11:37.464
Leave it to me.

11:37.497 --> 11:40.100
Romantic reunions
are my speciality.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.402
Ok. Ok.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.337
You have choir practise
in the garage.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.939
Your students are waiting
for you.

11:45.973 --> 11:47.274
Oh, right.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.141
Thanks.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.109
Yeah.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.182
Which way is the garage?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.918
Just... keep walking.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.754
Hey, hey!

12:00.788 --> 12:01.822
Missed you guys!

12:01.855 --> 12:02.255
Hey!

12:02.289 --> 12:03.423
Hi!

12:03.456 --> 12:04.925
Hey, how're we doing?

12:04.958 --> 12:05.893
Group hug.

12:05.926 --> 12:09.196
I got something for ya
from the road, guys.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.831
Tour t-shirts.

12:10.864 --> 12:11.865
Wow.

12:11.899 --> 12:12.632
Right?

12:12.665 --> 12:14.134
My aunt saw you play
last week.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.205
Oh, that's right- she got up
on stage and danced.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.239
She was really good, too.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.110
You tell her she gets a
backstage pass next time, ok?

12:23.143 --> 12:25.478
You guys been, uh,
practising while I've been gone?

12:25.512 --> 12:26.814
Yes!

12:26.847 --> 12:27.815
Does singing in
the shower count?

12:27.848 --> 12:28.548
Absolutely, it counts.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.251
You got the new
sheet music?

12:31.284 --> 12:32.052
A love song?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.420
Well, I hope somebody
loves it.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.088
Looks like a love song
to me.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.156
For Olivia?

12:36.189 --> 12:38.525
I think we're getting a
little sidetracked, here.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.759
He's changing the subject.

12:39.793 --> 12:43.296
Is this a therapy session for me
or is this choir rehearsal?

12:43.330 --> 12:45.132
Both.

12:45.165 --> 12:45.999
Sit down.

12:46.033 --> 12:46.433
Here we go.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.868
Let's warm up.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.172
Two, three, and...

12:57.177 --> 12:58.045
Nice.

13:26.073 --> 13:29.877
♪ Oh, I'm gonna drive
Miss Daisy, ♪

13:29.910 --> 13:31.511

13:31.544 --> 13:34.314

13:36.083 --> 13:37.985

13:38.018 --> 13:40.053
Hi. I guess the tour
isn't over.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.221
Olivia!

13:42.923 --> 13:44.191
You're early.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.059
I- I could come back
for the late show.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.195
How long have you been
standing there?

13:48.228 --> 13:50.330
Air guitar and spin.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.433
No, no, no.
Wait a minute.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.202
It's uh... it's wet.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.040
Thank you.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.576
Wow. So chivalrous.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.016
Hi.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.250
Hi.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.054
You're here.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.255
Yeah.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.125
I'm here.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.160
How was the drive?

14:20.193 --> 14:20.727
It was good.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.095
Yeah, it was good. Easy.

14:22.129 --> 14:22.996
Yeah.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.231
You look really good.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.532
Oh, thanks.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.100
Better than on FaceTime?

14:27.134 --> 14:29.002
Yeah. Much.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.138
You too.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.006
And here I thought this was
gonna feel awkward.

14:33.040 --> 14:37.044
Yeah, well, it still might be.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.379
There's something
that I haven't told you.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.413
Oh.

14:40.447 --> 14:41.481
Something other than you're
selling your house

14:41.514 --> 14:43.283
and you're giving your business
to your daughter?

14:43.316 --> 14:44.918
Something other than that?

14:44.952 --> 14:46.319
Yeah, yeah.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.355
Maybe. Just a little.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.190
Oh, ok.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.591
Well, maybe we should go down
by the lake

14:51.624 --> 14:53.160
in case I need to jump in.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.827
Good idea.

14:54.861 --> 15:00.133
The thing is my being here
is a really big step, you know,

15:00.167 --> 15:01.001
for both of us.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.435
Yeah, of course it is.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.370
And I'm good with it.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.138
Good.

15:05.172 --> 15:07.040
'Cause... I wanna help you
turn this place

15:07.074 --> 15:10.043
into the best wedding resort
in Vermont.

15:10.077 --> 15:13.380
Oh. Well, that's nice.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.982
What does that mean,
exactly?

15:15.015 --> 15:18.618
It means I wanna help you
run this place.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.419
Oh.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.654
So you don't wanna
just live here,

15:21.688 --> 15:23.356
you wanna work together?

15:23.390 --> 15:24.424
Yeah.

15:24.457 --> 15:28.128
Well, to quote a popular
phrase around here, I do.

15:28.161 --> 15:31.031
It might be a little
complicated, you see.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.433
I'm about ready to take on
a partner.

15:33.466 --> 15:34.567
I know.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.535
What?

15:35.568 --> 15:37.170
I was looking for places
to rent around here

15:37.204 --> 15:39.572
and your broker told me
that you were, um,

15:39.606 --> 15:41.408
in a bit of a situation.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.543
Ok, this has just gotten
incredibly awkward.

15:43.576 --> 15:47.480
Mick, when you were on the road
I had a lot of time to think

15:47.514 --> 15:50.617
and I realized that it would be
crazy for me to jump head first

15:50.650 --> 15:52.385
into a new relationship.

15:52.419 --> 15:56.356
I mean, I was just engaged
and you've been single

15:56.389 --> 15:57.157
for a long time.

15:57.190 --> 16:00.593
So you wanna be
business partners?

16:00.627 --> 16:01.528
Besides, it'll give us a chance

16:01.561 --> 16:03.997
to really get to know
each other again.

16:04.031 --> 16:07.067
Just take it slow, right?

16:08.235 --> 16:09.069
Yeah.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.437
Yeah, slow is great.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.538
Good.

16:11.571 --> 16:12.639
I was thinking I could move
into the carriage house.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.308
I know it needs a lot of work
but fixing things up

16:15.342 --> 16:17.177
is what I'm good at.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.745
You really have thought
this through.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.713
Yeah, and it's gonna be amazing.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.082
I know it.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.152
We're shaking hands now?

16:30.823 --> 16:33.526
If it's ok I'd like to go check
out the carriage house.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.994
Mmm.

16:44.271 --> 16:45.405
Was that Olivia?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.543
You ok?

16:50.577 --> 16:55.115
Yeah, it's just not the romantic
reunion I had planned.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.516
She's not staying?

16:56.549 --> 16:59.186
Oh yeah, she's staying.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.165
I liked the candles.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.636
Well, that's for the romance
package, partner.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.704
Ok.

17:18.738 --> 17:22.809
Well, I do get to eat, don't I?

17:22.842 --> 17:24.544
Just this once.

17:27.114 --> 17:31.384
Ok, chicken cacciatore
for two à la Julie.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.485
Wow, looks amazing.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.787
You might just have to replace
Duke in the kitchen.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.523
No one can grill cheese
like Duke.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.690
Oh, that's true.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.193
Remember when he poisoned
the entire dorm room floor?

17:40.227 --> 17:42.362
Spoiled cheddar incident?

17:42.395 --> 17:43.763
Well, you'll be eating a lot
of my cooking

17:43.796 --> 17:45.698
because we're here
for the whole summer.

17:45.732 --> 17:46.599
We?

17:46.633 --> 17:47.834
Wyatt and I.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.702
That's still not decided on.

17:49.736 --> 17:50.703
Dad.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.272
Hello.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.107
Hi.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.775
Olivia, this is my boyfriend,
Wyatt.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.110
Ugh.

17:57.777 --> 17:58.678
Hi, Olivia.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.547
Uh, Mick's business partner.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.381
Nice to meet you.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.014
You, too.

18:02.048 --> 18:02.749
Would you like some wine?

18:02.782 --> 18:04.217
Oh, yes please.

18:09.389 --> 18:09.756
Thank you.

18:09.789 --> 18:10.590
Enjoy.

18:10.623 --> 18:11.591
Ok.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.162
Seems like a nice kid.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.396
I'm still vetting him.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.365
Vetting him?

18:18.398 --> 18:19.366
He's overly polite
and helpful.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.634
And he was holding my daughter's
hand earlier.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.736
Oh, call homeland security.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.405
It's not easy having a daughter.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.072
I know.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.774
Who names their kid "Wyatt"?

18:27.807 --> 18:29.142
There's Wyatt Earp.

18:29.176 --> 18:30.210
Yeah, a gunslinger.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.179
I'm pretty sure he was
a marshall.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.747
Potato tomato.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.783
So how are reservations?

18:36.816 --> 18:39.152
Do we have any
weddings booked?

18:39.186 --> 18:41.488
We have a few reservations
here and there and...

18:41.521 --> 18:42.889
the weddings we had booked
have been cancelled

18:42.922 --> 18:44.824
'cause the new place opened.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.227
When was the last time
this place was fixed up?

18:47.260 --> 18:48.728
Well, it's been a while.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.297
Since your almost wedding.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.299
So I'm not saying that we need
all new furniture.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.901
Just slip covers, maybe some
throw pillows,

18:54.934 --> 18:56.169
a couple coats of paint here.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.270
Like, get rid of the wallpaper-

18:57.304 --> 18:59.306
I was actually looking for more
of a silent partner.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.708
Re-do all of the drapery,
for sure.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.310
I think I'm gonna go get
that bottle of wine.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.512
I kinda like the floors, though,
I have to admit that.

19:06.946 --> 19:09.249
Those flowers are bugging me.

19:23.696 --> 19:24.664
You're doing really great.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.399
Olivia is super nice.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.735
Olivia really likes you,
it'll be great.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.169
Excuse me.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.512
I don't think he likes me much.

19:39.546 --> 19:40.347
It's not you.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.180
He thinks I'm still
his little girl.

19:41.214 --> 19:43.750
And he probably will
until I'm 60.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.419
Plus, you're the first guy
I've brought home

19:46.453 --> 19:50.590
and I didn't tell him
I was bringing you.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.292
Talk about stacking the cards
against me.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.125
You'll win him over.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.395
Besides, he won't be
focusing on you.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.430
He's too busy hiding
his feelings from Olivia.

19:57.464 --> 19:58.698
I thought you said
they were a thing.

19:58.731 --> 19:59.766
They are.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.802
Promise me we'll never get
weird like that.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.571
I promise.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.307
Your dad's not coming back in,
is he?

20:07.340 --> 20:08.708
Better make it quick.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.431
I just need to move
that credenza.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.343
Oh, room service?

20:43.376 --> 20:45.612
For our valued guests.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.380
Well, thank you.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.287
Thank you.

20:54.321 --> 20:55.888
How are you this morning?

20:55.922 --> 20:57.724
I couldn't sleep last night.

20:57.757 --> 20:58.891
Neither could I.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.827
I'm just so excited.

21:00.860 --> 21:01.594
Yeah.

21:01.628 --> 21:02.128
Me too.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.396
Hey, I was thinking

21:03.430 --> 21:06.065
that we could go check out that
new place down the road today.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.000
I see it every day when
I have to drive by it.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.303
Well, I haven't seen it yet.

21:17.710 --> 21:18.745
Wow.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.784
Six weddings in one day?

21:24.817 --> 21:26.986
Who gets married on a Thursday?

21:27.019 --> 21:28.521
It's Saturday.

21:28.555 --> 21:30.056
Who gets married
on a Saturday?

21:30.089 --> 21:32.425
The Masons and LaMars,
Wilsons and Walkers-

21:32.459 --> 21:33.726
Why don't they just have
an assembly line

21:33.760 --> 21:34.961
of brides and grooms

21:34.994 --> 21:38.465
or just one big group wedding
and get it all done at once?

21:42.435 --> 21:43.803
I'm just going to take...

21:43.836 --> 21:45.405
Thank you.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.710
They have a spa.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.413
We have a fire pit.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.948
And an infinity pool.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.083
We have a lake.

21:57.116 --> 21:58.451
With ducks.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.552
Hello.

21:59.586 --> 22:00.687
Hi.

22:00.720 --> 22:01.754
Can I help you?

22:01.788 --> 22:05.425
Yes, we are interested in
your wedding packages.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.627
Congratulations.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.561
Thank you.

22:08.595 --> 22:11.063
Hey, you're...
you're Mick Turner, right?

22:11.097 --> 22:13.700
You own the Willow Lake Inn.

22:13.733 --> 22:14.934
Right.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.536
And you guys wanna
get married here?

22:16.569 --> 22:17.470
We do.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.372
It's- it's a ways down
the road, though.

22:19.406 --> 22:20.973
A long and winding road.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.876
Well, it's never too early
to start planning ahead.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.945
We're actually booking
into the fall right now.

22:25.978 --> 22:26.746
Wow.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.415
For what year?

22:28.448 --> 22:31.918
Why don't you take a look
at our nuptial options.

22:31.951 --> 22:34.421
I'm with some clients right now
so have a look around.

22:34.454 --> 22:35.855
Ok, thank you.

22:35.888 --> 22:36.689
You're welcome.

22:36.723 --> 22:37.790
Nuptial options?

22:37.824 --> 22:38.725
Nup-ops?

22:38.758 --> 22:39.792
Stop it.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.494
Let's go sit down.

22:42.662 --> 22:43.396
Hey, Mick.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.131
Oh, hey, Brent.

22:45.164 --> 22:48.468
Uh, I think you can lose
the hat and glasses now.

22:51.504 --> 22:54.741
So... have we come
to a final decision?

22:54.774 --> 22:56.809
I think we have.

22:56.843 --> 22:59.011
We're going with
the platinum package.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.448
Honey, what do you think?

23:01.481 --> 23:04.083
We can't do any better
than that.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.485
What's the difference

23:05.518 --> 23:08.488
between the platinum
and the silver package?

23:08.521 --> 23:11.758
The platinum is our ultimate
experience.

23:11.791 --> 23:14.594
Silver doesn't have the personal
ice sculptures

23:14.627 --> 23:17.430
or the filet mignon
Chilean sea bass option.

23:17.464 --> 23:20.633
Or the Tiffany wedding favours.

23:20.667 --> 23:23.636
The gold package is a very
nice compromise.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.037
There's a spa day
for wedding guests

23:25.071 --> 23:26.506
and a complimentary
round of golf.

23:26.539 --> 23:29.075
What about the basic package?

23:29.108 --> 23:30.510
Basic?

23:30.543 --> 23:32.078
I'm pretty sure it means normal.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.513
Do you really wanna look back

23:33.546 --> 23:35.648
and think that our wedding
was basic?

23:35.682 --> 23:37.550
Why can't we just
look forward?

23:37.584 --> 23:41.621
Because it's the most
special day of our lives.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.025
Is something wrong?

23:46.058 --> 23:49.061
I am so sorry but
there is a problem

23:49.095 --> 23:52.532
with your reservation date.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.501
Uh, what kind of problem?

23:54.534 --> 23:57.770
It would appear that
we are double booked

23:57.804 --> 24:01.508
and unfortunately our computer
gave your date

24:01.541 --> 24:03.576
to another couple.

24:08.815 --> 24:14.654
A computer gave away
our wedding date?

24:14.687 --> 24:16.723
I can put you on the wait list.

24:16.756 --> 24:19.992
Uh... maybe something will come
up before the September date-

24:20.026 --> 24:21.761
A wait list?

24:21.794 --> 24:24.030
We were supposed to have
a June wedding.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.798
Everyone's already RSVP'd.

24:25.832 --> 24:30.136
I am so very, very sorry,
and we will of course give you

24:30.169 --> 24:32.939
a full refund on your deposit.

24:32.972 --> 24:37.143
I'll leave you two alone
and you can decide what to do.

24:37.777 --> 24:42.281
Honey, uh...
maybe this is fate?

24:43.282 --> 24:44.851
So you don't
wanna marry me?!

24:44.884 --> 24:45.284
No, no, no, no.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.886
Of course I do.

24:46.919 --> 24:50.523
Just... not here.

24:50.557 --> 24:51.724
You know what?

24:51.758 --> 24:54.260
Let's... let's forget all this
and we'll uh, we'll elope.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.568
Thank you.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.770
I couldn't help but overhear.

25:03.803 --> 25:04.937
I'm so sorry.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.072
I can't believe this.

25:06.105 --> 25:08.174
I... what am I gonna
tell everyone?

25:08.207 --> 25:09.776
I just...

25:09.809 --> 25:11.277
I just wanted
everything to be perfect

25:11.310 --> 25:14.246
just for this one day.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.815
Oh, I understand.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.684
And it should.

25:17.717 --> 25:20.019
Have you ever heard of
Willow Lake Inn?

25:22.755 --> 25:23.890
No.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.761
It's beautiful.

25:28.795 --> 25:29.662
Yeah.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.197
That's... that's gorgeous.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.799
Well, I think so, too.

25:32.832 --> 25:33.800
We think so.

25:33.833 --> 25:34.901
Oh!

25:34.934 --> 25:35.935
Oh my gosh!

25:35.968 --> 25:37.604
It's Mick Turner!

25:37.637 --> 25:39.639
Chris, it's Mick Turner!

25:41.240 --> 25:43.610
I loved your music
when I was a kid.

25:43.643 --> 25:44.844
Yeah, same here.

25:44.877 --> 25:45.578
Thank you.

25:45.612 --> 25:47.279
My mom played it
all the time.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.648
Oh yeah.

25:48.681 --> 25:51.150
I'm big with the moms.

25:51.183 --> 25:55.855
Well... maybe we should...
go see it?

25:55.888 --> 25:56.989
Yeah.

25:57.023 --> 25:59.058
It's up Route One a couple
miles, you can't miss it.

25:59.091 --> 26:00.159
Ok.

26:00.192 --> 26:02.929
Well, we'll see you.

26:05.164 --> 26:07.700
So you're a wedding
poacher now?

26:07.734 --> 26:11.971
I think I'm going to need
my name on the business cards.

26:25.718 --> 26:28.655
It's so rustic and charming.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.957
Rustic and charm
are our speciality.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.091
Right.

26:32.124 --> 26:35.828
You know, we started off
picturing something like this,

26:35.862 --> 26:37.864
but I got a little swept up.

26:37.897 --> 26:38.798
A little?

26:39.999 --> 26:41.133
Corrine's been
planning her wedding

26:41.167 --> 26:42.234
since she was eight.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.235
No way!

26:43.269 --> 26:44.336
Seven.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.172
I put a sheet on my head
and pretended it was a veil.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.008
That's really cute.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.242
How did you guys meet?

26:50.276 --> 26:52.178
Chris is a landscape artist.

26:52.211 --> 26:53.045
A landscaper.

26:53.079 --> 26:56.115
She likes to add that
"artiste" part.

26:56.148 --> 26:57.083
She's an editor.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.118
I work with a publishing house
in the city.

26:59.151 --> 27:02.855
I left work early one day,
which is something I never do,

27:02.889 --> 27:05.391
and I took a walk
in the park.

27:05.424 --> 27:07.126
And he was there,

27:07.159 --> 27:11.130
planting trees in jeans
and a dirt covered shirt.

27:11.163 --> 27:13.666
He was totally different
from the suit and tie guys

27:13.700 --> 27:15.401
I had been dating.

27:15.434 --> 27:17.336
And that was it.

27:17.369 --> 27:18.938
And when I looked at her
I said

27:18.971 --> 27:20.840
"that's the girl
I'm gonna marry".

27:20.873 --> 27:21.273
Awe.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.308
I'm so lucky.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.944
No, I'm the lucky one.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.915
You guys are so cute.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.016
Aren't they?

27:30.049 --> 27:31.718
Cute.

27:31.751 --> 27:32.719
Are you two married?

27:32.752 --> 27:34.053
No.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.956
But you're a couple, right?

27:38.958 --> 27:42.361
Workplace romances are frowned
upon around here.

27:42.394 --> 27:45.164
Sort of like the ebb and flow
of the ocean.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.933
Right now we're ebbing.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.769
Would you guys like to see
the gazebo?

27:49.802 --> 27:50.402
Oh!

27:50.436 --> 27:51.804
This way.

27:54.273 --> 27:55.474
It's perfect.

27:55.507 --> 27:59.211
A small, intimate wedding
by the lake.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.247
I can absolutely see us here.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.315
Me too.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.717
Then it's settled.

28:04.751 --> 28:06.719
We'd love to have
our wedding here.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.020
That's wonderful!

28:08.054 --> 28:10.022
Do you have anything available
in June?

28:10.056 --> 28:11.023
We sure do.

28:11.057 --> 28:13.325
Any day between June 1st
and June 30th right now.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.061
We'd like to keep our date.

28:15.094 --> 28:15.995
June 3rd?

28:16.028 --> 28:17.263
June 3rd it is.

28:17.296 --> 28:18.397
That's in, like, two weeks.

28:18.430 --> 28:19.498
I know it's soon,

28:19.531 --> 28:20.733
but everything's already
been planned.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.802
All we have to do is change
the address and a few details.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.071
You don't have the platinum
package here, right?

28:25.104 --> 28:26.138
Never heard of it.

28:26.172 --> 28:28.474
Oh, this is so exciting!

28:28.507 --> 28:31.944
And we've made a decision.

28:31.978 --> 28:34.881
We want you to be
our wedding singer.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.182
Oh, that's nice, but I-

28:36.215 --> 28:37.249
If you'll do us the honour.

28:37.283 --> 28:38.084
I don't really-

28:38.117 --> 28:41.220
Of course he will.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.923
You're right. This is fate.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.192
Aww.

28:49.361 --> 28:50.229
I'm so happy for you.

28:50.262 --> 28:51.764
I'm so excited!

28:55.067 --> 28:56.769
Ok.

28:58.437 --> 28:59.939
Here's my look book.

28:59.972 --> 29:00.940
Wow.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.141
I'm still on the fence
about one or two things

29:02.174 --> 29:04.143
but it's all in there.

29:05.912 --> 29:07.847
This is going
to be great!

29:09.415 --> 29:10.182
I'll text you.

29:10.216 --> 29:10.850
Great.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.251
We'll see you on the second.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.752
Can't wait!

29:16.255 --> 29:18.257
Awe, they are so cute.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.458
Mmm.

29:19.491 --> 29:20.259
Look book?

29:23.863 --> 29:24.530
Look at this thing.

29:24.563 --> 29:25.564
It's like an encyclopedia.

29:25.597 --> 29:26.765
No, it's not.

29:26.799 --> 29:30.436
You do know that one wedding
isn't gonna save this place.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.571
One leads to the next.

29:32.604 --> 29:36.075
Especially if it's
the best wedding ever.

29:37.877 --> 29:40.479
So... this is this how
it's gonna be, huh?

29:40.512 --> 29:41.981
Pretty much.

29:45.918 --> 29:48.888
♪ Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, ♪

29:48.921 --> 29:50.957
♪ Oh, woah yeah, ♪

29:50.990 --> 29:54.026

30:04.603 --> 30:10.409
♪ Woah, woah, woah, ♪

30:10.442 --> 30:12.611
♪ Sha-na-na-na-na ♪

30:12.644 --> 30:15.214
Alright,
let's take a quick break.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.416
Oh, hi.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.585
Countdown to "I do",
six days.

30:19.618 --> 30:21.988
Ok. How are we doing
on the flowers?

30:22.021 --> 30:26.625
Got the flowers, cake,
place settings, gift baskets...

30:26.658 --> 30:28.494
I can't believe we did
all this in a week.

30:28.527 --> 30:29.461
It's only been a week?

30:29.495 --> 30:31.063
We've done a lot of weddings
over the years

30:31.097 --> 30:34.200
but it's always been
a little disorganized.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.201
You know my dad,

30:35.234 --> 30:37.904
he's more of a musician
than a wedding planner.

30:37.937 --> 30:39.605
I'm just really glad
you're here.

30:39.638 --> 30:40.306
Awe, thank you.

30:40.339 --> 30:41.240
So am I.

30:41.273 --> 30:42.441
And so is he.

30:42.474 --> 30:47.213
He's just sometimes better
with lyrics than actual words.

30:48.247 --> 30:49.248
I- I get it.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.182
I get it.

30:50.216 --> 30:52.118
Me too, I- I guess.

30:52.151 --> 30:53.152
I'm just saying,

30:53.185 --> 30:57.957
if you need anyone to talk
to about anything...

30:57.990 --> 31:00.359
Oh, well thank you, but I
think we should probably focus

31:00.392 --> 31:02.328
on the ETA of the bouquet.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.495
Bouquet.

31:03.529 --> 31:04.730
Ok.

31:04.763 --> 31:08.000
And Corrine's texted a few times
about the rehearsal dinner.

31:08.034 --> 31:08.968
A few?

31:09.001 --> 31:10.369
I think I've gotten,
like, twenty already.

31:10.402 --> 31:11.337
That's all?

31:12.471 --> 31:14.440
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, ♪

31:14.473 --> 31:17.109
♪ Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, ♪

31:17.143 --> 31:19.478
♪ Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da-da, ♪

31:19.511 --> 31:20.947
♪ Woah, ♪

31:20.980 --> 31:22.648
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, ♪

31:22.681 --> 31:25.217
♪ Sha-na-na-na-na ♪

31:25.251 --> 31:26.252
Woo-woo!

31:26.285 --> 31:27.219
Nice.

31:28.054 --> 31:30.156
You guys are
sounding good today.

31:30.189 --> 31:33.559
Well, I got a little bit of news
for you before I let you go.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.261
I have a gig.

31:35.294 --> 31:38.364
And the better news is you guys
are singing with me.

31:38.397 --> 31:39.565
We're going on tour?

31:39.598 --> 31:41.367
No, we're not going on tour,
we're going to the backyard

31:41.400 --> 31:42.334
to the gazebo.

31:43.435 --> 31:44.503
We got a wedding this weekend
to sing in Sunday

31:44.536 --> 31:46.472
and I've already cleared it
with all your parents.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.942
The best part is there's gonna
be free food.

31:49.976 --> 31:50.876
What kind of food?

31:50.909 --> 31:53.980
Uh, chicken, fish, pasta,
I don't know.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.581
The bride can't make
her mind up about anything,

31:55.614 --> 31:57.249
but there's for sure gonna
be cake.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.286
So I want you guys to continue
to work on the song

32:00.319 --> 32:02.254
"Someone is You", that's what
we're gonna be singing.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.456
Ally I want you to take
those ad-lib solos.

32:04.490 --> 32:06.125
The rest of us, we're gonna
sing the chorus in unis-

32:06.158 --> 32:07.059
Mick?

32:07.093 --> 32:07.693
Yeah.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.428
Can you pick someone else?

32:09.461 --> 32:10.629
Why?

32:10.662 --> 32:12.331
I just don't want to.

32:13.832 --> 32:15.968
Ok, well listen, that's a wrap
for today, guys, ok?

32:16.002 --> 32:17.236
Great work.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.170
See you Sunday.

32:18.204 --> 32:19.105
Thanks.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.107
Ally, can you stick around
for a second?

32:28.214 --> 32:29.448
Hey.

32:32.018 --> 32:33.719
You know I um...

32:33.752 --> 32:35.321
I asked you to do those solos

32:35.354 --> 32:37.756
'cause I think you have
such a great voice.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.591
Thank you.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.593
But I just can't.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.529
I'll freeze.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.364
Oh, I got ya.

32:45.397 --> 32:48.334
The first time I had to sing
alone I almost fainted.

32:48.367 --> 32:49.735
But then I went on stage
anyway and you know,

32:49.768 --> 32:52.271
when I started to sing,

32:52.304 --> 32:54.640
all that fear just disappeared
in the music.

32:54.673 --> 32:55.607
When was that?

32:55.641 --> 32:57.276
My seventh grade assembly.

32:59.145 --> 33:03.349
You know, the truth is...
I still get nervous.

33:03.382 --> 33:05.217
Before all these shows
I just had,

33:05.251 --> 33:07.119
I was nervous before
every one of them.

33:07.153 --> 33:07.519
Really?

33:07.553 --> 33:08.387
Yeah.

33:08.420 --> 33:09.355
And you know what?

33:09.388 --> 33:10.556
It's ok.

33:10.589 --> 33:14.260
And you got a few days, so
just think about it, alright?

33:16.662 --> 33:18.130
Alright.

33:41.220 --> 33:43.422
What did she do to my office?

33:54.300 --> 33:56.702
What happened to my office?

33:56.735 --> 33:58.837
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.606
It's disgusting in there, Mick.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.276
Oh. Well, maybe
I let things slide

34:04.310 --> 34:06.478
after Julie moved away
to college.

34:06.512 --> 34:07.246
Hmm.

34:09.514 --> 34:11.250
So, what do you think?

34:12.684 --> 34:14.585
It's different.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.121
And?

34:16.155 --> 34:18.690
I thought you gave up
the whole staging thing.

34:18.724 --> 34:19.658
I can move it back.

34:19.690 --> 34:20.726
No, no, no. It's nice.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.828
Maybe I'm just used to seeing
it the other way.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.830
Yeah, probably.

34:24.862 --> 34:26.797
I heard your choir today.

34:26.831 --> 34:27.666
Oh, you did?

34:27.699 --> 34:28.600
Yeah, they sounded great.

34:28.634 --> 34:29.400
Thanks.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.337
One of the girls
has stage fright.

34:31.370 --> 34:32.304
Awe.

34:32.338 --> 34:34.139
Well, maybe you can tell her
how you overcame

34:34.172 --> 34:35.507
your fear of staging.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.676
I'm not sure that I had
but thanks for the tip.

34:37.708 --> 34:38.710
You're welcome.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.545
Look how much better
that looks.

34:40.579 --> 34:41.580
I don't see it.

34:43.849 --> 34:44.850
Oh, it's Corrine.

34:44.882 --> 34:46.652
They are on their way.

34:46.685 --> 34:47.585
What?

34:47.619 --> 34:49.155
They were supposed to come
up this weekend

34:49.188 --> 34:50.088
with everyone else.

34:50.121 --> 34:51.790
No, they decided to come
a few days early.

34:51.822 --> 34:54.126
Oh, no, no, no, this is
a big red flag.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.161
You know, she's an editor.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.763
Editors change their minds
over and over again.

34:57.796 --> 34:58.830
They're never satisfied.

34:58.864 --> 35:00.466
And you know this how?

35:00.499 --> 35:02.134
Well, we did the wedding
for the editor

35:02.168 --> 35:03.669
of the Vermont Maple Newsletter.

35:03.702 --> 35:04.803
Oh. Never heard of 'em.

35:04.836 --> 35:07.373
Well, people around here have
and she was very picky.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.675
Well, Corrine edits
children's books.

35:09.708 --> 35:10.809
That's even worse.

35:10.842 --> 35:13.712
She'll be all about fairy tales
and happy endings now.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.247
This could be a nightmare.

35:15.281 --> 35:15.947
Oh, wow.

35:15.981 --> 35:17.516
The chairs look great like that.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.450
Thank you.

35:18.484 --> 35:19.618
You're the future
of the hotel industry.

35:19.651 --> 35:20.886
What do you think?

35:20.919 --> 35:22.654
I think that if the quality
of service

35:22.688 --> 35:23.589
is as good as this place is

35:23.622 --> 35:25.491
than your guests could sit
on wood stumps.

35:26.592 --> 35:27.493
I like that.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.228
'Cause I got a lot of wood
stumps out back.

35:29.261 --> 35:31.430
You don't have to side
with my dad.

35:31.463 --> 35:31.863
I don't?

35:31.897 --> 35:32.664
No.

35:32.698 --> 35:33.532
Oh.

35:33.565 --> 35:35.701
Well in that case I like
it where it is.

35:35.734 --> 35:36.635
What do you know?

35:36.668 --> 35:37.603
You live in a dorm.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.738
Actually he lives in
an off-campus apartment.

35:39.771 --> 35:41.240
Not helping.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.582
He is really warming up
to me.

35:50.616 --> 35:51.550
I told you he would.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.952
By the end of the summer
you'll be best buds.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.521
I'm just hoping
I'm still alive.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.723
Oh you'll be alive, just
living in the next town.

35:57.756 --> 35:59.258
Great.

36:09.268 --> 36:09.901
We're here!

36:09.935 --> 36:10.736
You made it.

36:10.769 --> 36:13.439
I can't tell you how excited
we are.

36:13.472 --> 36:14.373
Oh.

36:14.406 --> 36:14.806
And thanks for letting us
come up early.

36:14.840 --> 36:15.941
Oh, of course.

36:15.974 --> 36:16.908
No problem.

36:16.942 --> 36:18.310
Did you get my text
about the extra names?

36:18.344 --> 36:18.944
I did.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.011
Wait, what extra names?

36:20.045 --> 36:24.416
My dad wanted to add a few
extra business clients.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.452
I thought we said only
close friends and family.

36:26.485 --> 36:29.488
It's just a couple more, you
won't even notice, I promise.

36:29.521 --> 36:33.859
I've just had so many
last minute ideas.

36:33.892 --> 36:34.660
Oh, wow.

36:34.693 --> 36:35.961
Here, let me help you
with that.

36:35.994 --> 36:38.930
I think that's everything.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.300
And I know we've already
agreed on the cake

36:41.333 --> 36:43.869
but I'm hoping you haven't
ordered it yet, have you?

36:43.902 --> 36:45.237
Well actually, I have-

36:45.271 --> 36:47.406
Because I'm re-thinking
the colour palate

36:47.439 --> 36:50.876
and we need to talk
about designing the logo.

36:50.909 --> 36:51.910
Logo?

36:51.943 --> 36:52.844
Don't you love it?

36:52.878 --> 36:53.579
Yes.

36:53.612 --> 36:54.713
It came to me
on the drive up.

36:54.746 --> 36:56.014
A couple's logo.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.949
Napkins and place settings.

36:57.983 --> 36:59.251
I love it.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.420
What colours are you thinking?

37:03.489 --> 37:04.990
You ok?

37:05.023 --> 37:05.891
Yeah. Yeah.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.026
She just gets swept up.

37:08.059 --> 37:08.894
It's weddings.

37:08.927 --> 37:09.995
I see it a lot.

37:10.028 --> 37:12.631
Me too, at the last two venues.

37:12.664 --> 37:13.499
What?

37:13.532 --> 37:15.467
Oh, her family's really
into weddings.

37:15.501 --> 37:18.304
Her sister had this
giant production.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.306
Her parents vow renewals
were just as big.

37:20.339 --> 37:21.607
You know, between you and me
I can't believe

37:21.640 --> 37:23.475
we finally have a place
and a date.

37:23.509 --> 37:25.344
Well, as long as the place
is here

37:25.377 --> 37:26.978
and the date is this Sunday.

37:27.012 --> 37:28.280
Yeah.

37:28.314 --> 37:29.448
She loves the Inn.

37:29.481 --> 37:30.048
She just-

37:30.081 --> 37:31.817
She's a bride.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.752
You might wanna add the word
"zilla" to that one.

37:39.691 --> 37:42.294
Well, it looks like you poached
the wrong egg, partner.

37:42.328 --> 37:43.795
Oh, calm down.

37:43.829 --> 37:44.996
It's just wedding jitters.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.899
A wedding she's apparently
been planning her entire life.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.736
I mean, she's changed the menu,
she's changed the flowers...

37:50.769 --> 37:51.670
a couple's logo?

37:51.703 --> 37:52.471
Who has a couple's logo?

37:52.504 --> 37:54.005
The Inn doesn't even have
a logo.

37:54.039 --> 37:56.041
I was thinking we should
have a logo.

37:56.074 --> 37:58.710
Well, you can put that
on my to-do list.

37:58.744 --> 37:59.945
I don't know how the bakery
is gonna feel

37:59.978 --> 38:01.780
about re-designing this cake,
either.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.549
Hey, we can handle one bride.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.617
It'll be a walk in the park.

38:05.651 --> 38:06.652
Yeah.

38:07.519 --> 38:08.687
Jurassic Park.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.289
Grumpy.

38:22.868 --> 38:25.036
Oh, wow!

38:25.070 --> 38:26.805
Are those all the new cakes?

38:26.838 --> 38:27.539
Yes.

38:27.573 --> 38:28.807
Yeah.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.410
We've got vanilla bundt cake,
angel food with raspberry cream,

38:31.443 --> 38:33.479
and last but not least,
red velvet.

38:33.512 --> 38:34.045
Mmm.

38:34.079 --> 38:34.846
They all look so good.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.082
I don't know which
to try first.

38:37.115 --> 38:39.551
And, by the way, I love all
your ideas.

38:39.585 --> 38:41.520
Your signature cocktail
is brilliant.

38:41.553 --> 38:42.554
Oh, good!

38:42.588 --> 38:43.722
Hey, where- where's Chris?

38:43.755 --> 38:45.857
Oh, he's opting out
of cake tasting.

38:45.891 --> 38:48.093
If it were up to him we'd have
a bag of doughnuts.

38:49.395 --> 38:50.496
I like doughnuts.

38:50.529 --> 38:52.898
Me too, but not for a wedding.

38:52.931 --> 38:53.699
Sit, you two.

38:53.732 --> 38:54.265
Dig in.

38:54.299 --> 38:54.866
You can help me decide.

38:54.900 --> 38:55.767
Ok.

38:55.801 --> 38:56.735
If you insist.

38:59.037 --> 39:02.408
I can't believe this is finally
happening.

39:02.441 --> 39:03.442
I shouldn't admit this,

39:03.475 --> 39:06.845
but I've had a subscription
to Bride magazine

39:06.878 --> 39:08.013
since I was seventeen.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.082
So no pressure then.

39:11.116 --> 39:12.117
No pressure.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.386
As long as it's the best day
of my entire life.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.022
Ok.

39:17.055 --> 39:19.791
I'm the last in my family
to get married.

39:19.825 --> 39:21.560
My sister's wedding?

39:21.593 --> 39:22.428
Amazing.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.696
It was on the cover of
Weddings Now.

39:24.730 --> 39:28.800
There was a pool with lily pads
that lit up when she walked by.

39:28.834 --> 39:29.735
Wow.

39:29.768 --> 39:30.301
Mmmhmm.

39:30.335 --> 39:31.336
I could look into that.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.038
I could look into floating
lights on the lake.

39:33.071 --> 39:33.805
Really?

39:33.839 --> 39:34.305
Yeah.

39:34.339 --> 39:35.674
That'd be amazing.

39:35.707 --> 39:36.642
Thank you.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.379
Mmm.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.450
I love all of these.

39:45.717 --> 39:50.889
But... I really want something
unforgettable.

39:50.922 --> 39:52.624
Ok, unforgettable.

39:52.658 --> 39:53.158
Hmm.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.527
What about...

39:55.561 --> 39:58.764
I don't know, just a big
giant cupcake tree?

39:58.797 --> 40:01.967
Good idea but one of my
bridesmaids already did that

40:02.000 --> 40:03.502
at her engagement party.

40:03.535 --> 40:05.036
Oh.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.505
Ok.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.476
I got it.

40:10.509 --> 40:13.479
What do you think
about personalized cakes

40:13.512 --> 40:16.181
so each guest gets
their own small cake?

40:16.214 --> 40:17.716
Personalized cakes?

40:17.749 --> 40:18.750
Yeah.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.452
Oh, I love it!

40:22.821 --> 40:24.856
Ok, so 26 small cakes.

40:24.890 --> 40:25.423
26-

40:25.457 --> 40:26.525
Actually, it's 32 now.

40:26.558 --> 40:31.096
And, ugh, possibly 33 if
Uncle Ted brings a plus one.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.197
We're gonna need to call
the bakery.

40:32.230 --> 40:32.931
You know what?

40:32.964 --> 40:33.865
Better make it 34.

40:33.899 --> 40:34.299
Yep.

40:34.332 --> 40:35.501
Just to be safe.

40:35.534 --> 40:38.904
And we should probably lock down
the ring bearer situation.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.673
My sister's ring bearer
was her French bulldog.

40:41.707 --> 40:45.143
It was definitely a highlight
and unforgettable.

40:45.176 --> 40:48.680
Do you have any super cute
nieces or nephews?

40:48.714 --> 40:53.184
One niece, but she's 16
and just dyed her hair green.

40:53.218 --> 40:55.521
That could be unforgettable.

40:55.554 --> 40:57.656
Don't worry, we'll figure
something out.

40:57.689 --> 40:58.690
Thank you.

40:58.724 --> 40:59.625
Yeah.

41:03.995 --> 41:04.796
Hey.

41:04.830 --> 41:05.831
Hey.

41:05.864 --> 41:07.098
Thanks for jumping in here
at the last minute.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.034
Yeah, I'm happy to help.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.136
Dare I ask the latest
head count?

41:11.169 --> 41:13.238
Well, there's at least
two as of now.

41:13.271 --> 41:14.205
Bride and groom?

41:14.239 --> 41:16.141
No, you and me.

41:16.174 --> 41:18.109
Leak down here?

41:18.143 --> 41:19.077
That's it.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.513
Are you sure you don't wanna
call a plumber?

41:21.547 --> 41:23.048
You remember what happened
at the Melman wedding?

41:23.081 --> 41:24.983
I think I can handle one leak.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.217
Alright.

41:26.251 --> 41:29.821
Well maybe when you're done
with that you can handle this.

41:29.855 --> 41:31.189
It's from Olivia.

41:31.222 --> 41:32.724
Is that another to-do list?

41:32.758 --> 41:33.792
Yeah.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.662
Read it.

41:36.695 --> 41:40.632
Uh, tivoli lights, votive
candles, candles, aroma candles,

41:40.666 --> 41:41.533
citronella candles...

41:41.567 --> 41:43.735
What, are we opening
a wax museum here?

41:43.769 --> 41:46.237
I know this isn't really how you
imagined things going with her

41:46.271 --> 41:48.740
but maybe this really is
all for the best.

41:48.774 --> 41:50.676
I mean, you guys are getting
to know each other again.

41:50.709 --> 41:52.578
No, this wasn't the plan.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.880
Me running errands and
working 24/7 together.

41:54.913 --> 41:56.882
Well, at least you have
a plan now.

41:56.915 --> 41:58.984
Or a list, anyway.

41:59.017 --> 42:00.018
I can still fire you.

42:00.051 --> 42:01.953
Alright. You're the boss.

42:01.987 --> 42:04.022
Technically Olivia's actually
the boss now...

42:04.055 --> 42:05.056
I heard that!

42:32.283 --> 42:33.952
I think you should do it.

42:33.985 --> 42:34.352
Really?

42:34.385 --> 42:35.053
Mmmhmm.

42:35.086 --> 42:36.054
Oh, there's our happy couple.

42:36.087 --> 42:36.955
Oh!

42:36.988 --> 42:39.057
I'm so glad you're here.

42:39.090 --> 42:40.191
We need a second opinion.

42:40.225 --> 42:41.927
Cummerbund or no cummerbund?

42:41.960 --> 42:43.895
Oh, I've never been a fan
of the 'bund.

42:43.929 --> 42:45.897
Ditto that.

42:45.931 --> 42:47.198
Ok.

42:47.232 --> 42:48.700
No cummerbund.

42:50.101 --> 42:51.903
But you look so handsome.

42:51.937 --> 42:54.205
And when am I ever gonna get
to see you in a a tux again?

42:54.239 --> 42:57.042
And don't say Halloween.

42:57.075 --> 42:57.843
What do you think?

42:57.876 --> 42:59.110
Tux or suit?

42:59.144 --> 42:59.945
Me?

42:59.978 --> 43:01.146
Mmmhmm.

43:01.179 --> 43:02.781
Oh, I'm probably not the right
person to ask about this.

43:02.814 --> 43:04.816
I... I suggest be yourself.

43:04.850 --> 43:06.384
That way when you look back
on these wedding pictures

43:06.417 --> 43:08.954
years from now you won't see
two strangers.

43:08.987 --> 43:10.121
Thank you.

43:10.155 --> 43:12.190
Sorry, looks like the tux
is out.

43:15.794 --> 43:16.594
Ooh.

43:16.628 --> 43:17.696
Olivia's locked down
the new flowers.

43:17.729 --> 43:21.166
And wait until you see the cakes
she's come up with.

43:21.199 --> 43:22.000
Cakes?

43:22.033 --> 43:22.533
Mmmhmm.

43:22.567 --> 43:23.835
As in more than one?

43:23.869 --> 43:25.003
A lot more.

43:25.036 --> 43:27.205
Every idea I have, she turns
it into something better.

43:27.238 --> 43:28.239
She's amazing.

43:28.273 --> 43:30.141
Of course, you already
know that.

43:30.175 --> 43:32.844
So we're done here, right?

43:32.878 --> 43:33.845
Almost.

43:33.879 --> 43:35.681
I just want to check out
a couple more bowties.

43:35.714 --> 43:37.082
It'll be just a sec.

43:40.886 --> 43:42.053
Hey, Mick.

43:42.087 --> 43:43.722
You're a musician.

43:43.755 --> 43:45.256
Been married a lot, right?

43:45.290 --> 43:46.024
No, no.

43:46.057 --> 43:47.125
Just once.

43:47.158 --> 43:48.393
Oh.

43:48.426 --> 43:51.062
You know, I always thought we'd
go with a justice of the peace.

43:51.096 --> 43:53.198
Tie a couple tin cans
to the back of the old car

43:53.231 --> 43:54.733
and head off into the sunset.

43:54.766 --> 43:58.770
Well, we have great sunsets
and we have tin cans.

43:58.804 --> 44:01.272
I'm just not sure where
Olivia moved the recycling bins.

44:01.306 --> 44:02.173
I'm guessing you're
going through

44:02.207 --> 44:04.242
a little something yourself?

44:04.275 --> 44:05.944
I guess you could say that.

44:05.977 --> 44:07.846
Guess we've all got
our issues, huh?

44:07.879 --> 44:10.215
But yours are gonna end Sunday.

44:10.248 --> 44:11.282
One can only hope.

44:12.718 --> 44:14.019
Look at these.

44:16.387 --> 44:17.856
What do you think?

44:19.457 --> 44:22.894
Uh... they're, uh... colourful.

44:22.928 --> 44:27.098
I'm leaning to this one
or this one.

44:27.132 --> 44:28.700
Yeah, um...

44:34.973 --> 44:38.209
Ok, I'm gonna go turn
the power back on.

44:38.243 --> 44:39.177
Be careful.

44:39.210 --> 44:40.946
Don't worry, I will.

44:41.813 --> 44:42.914
Hey!

44:42.948 --> 44:44.315
Looking good.

44:44.349 --> 44:45.216
Yeah.

44:49.888 --> 44:51.790
Olivia, do you think you could
talk to my dad

44:51.823 --> 44:53.358
about cutting Wyatt some slack?

44:53.391 --> 44:56.327
He's so overprotective.

44:56.361 --> 44:58.797
Especially since I went off
to school.

44:58.830 --> 45:01.366
Honey, it's just a parent thing.

45:01.399 --> 45:02.333
Trust me.

45:02.367 --> 45:05.503
So... you'll talk to him?

45:05.536 --> 45:08.807
Of course, but I doubt
he'll listen to me.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.809
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

45:13.845 --> 45:17.248
Can I... tell you something?

45:17.282 --> 45:21.787
Well, yeah honey, anything.

45:21.820 --> 45:25.190
I really like Wyatt.

45:25.223 --> 45:30.095
I think I might even love him.

45:30.128 --> 45:32.497
Oh.

45:32.530 --> 45:34.465
Is it your first love?

45:34.499 --> 45:36.501
Yeah.

45:36.534 --> 45:38.103
Don't tell my dad.

45:38.136 --> 45:40.105
I won't.

45:40.138 --> 45:41.940
Ok.

45:41.973 --> 45:44.109
Do you remember
your first love?

45:44.142 --> 45:48.379
Yeah, well, sometimes
I wish I didn't.

45:48.413 --> 45:49.948
My dad?

45:49.981 --> 45:51.016
Yeah.

45:51.049 --> 45:54.085
I always heard you never
get over your first love.

45:54.119 --> 45:55.320
Is that true?

45:58.990 --> 46:00.258
I'll take that as a yes.

46:00.291 --> 46:00.926
Julie!

46:00.959 --> 46:02.794
I'm gonna go check on Wyatt.

46:33.624 --> 46:35.894
They're playing our song.

46:38.063 --> 46:41.199
I thought our song was
"The Long and Winding Road".

46:43.334 --> 46:45.303
Care to check out
the dance floor?

46:45.336 --> 46:48.006
It's job-related.

46:52.944 --> 46:54.279
Wow.

46:54.312 --> 46:57.148
You're pretty good.

46:57.182 --> 47:00.118
Do you remember the first time
we danced slow?

47:00.151 --> 47:05.056
Yeah, it was in the laundry
room, with the doors.

47:05.090 --> 47:07.192
Do you remember how
the flaurescent lights

47:07.225 --> 47:09.560
reflected in your hair?

47:09.594 --> 47:11.196
Yeah, you?

47:11.229 --> 47:14.199
You were out of detergent
and asked to borrow a quarter.

47:14.232 --> 47:15.200
Did not.

47:15.233 --> 47:17.002
Yes, you did.

47:21.306 --> 47:23.909
Everything ok?

47:23.942 --> 47:27.245
I forgot to confirm the
personalized ice sculptures.

47:27.278 --> 47:29.214
Personal ice sculptures?

47:29.247 --> 47:30.248
It's summer.

47:30.281 --> 47:34.519
Yeah, they melt in the cup
and you drink them.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.889
Why is it starting to feel
like the platinum package

47:37.923 --> 47:39.090
around here?

47:39.124 --> 47:42.961
Uh... would that be so bad?

47:42.994 --> 47:45.363
This was supposed to be
a small, intimate wedding.

47:45.396 --> 47:48.366
Yeah, well now it's gonna be
large and less intimate.

47:51.436 --> 47:52.237
What the...?

47:53.471 --> 47:55.040
Sorry! Sorry.

47:59.077 --> 48:00.511
Did you do that on purpose?

48:00.545 --> 48:01.446
No.

48:01.479 --> 48:03.448
I was momentarily blinded
by all of this.

48:03.481 --> 48:05.050
This is what the bride wants.

48:05.083 --> 48:06.584
Well, until one of you changes
your mind.

48:06.617 --> 48:07.986
What do you mean
"one of us"?

48:08.019 --> 48:10.288
It just feels like
you're overly involved.

48:10.321 --> 48:11.689
No, I'm not.

48:11.722 --> 48:13.391
I'm just doing what
the bride wants.

48:13.424 --> 48:15.060
Well, what if she doesn't know
what she wants?

48:15.093 --> 48:16.127
What is the groom
supposed to do?

48:16.161 --> 48:17.628
Stand around and change
his tie?

48:17.662 --> 48:19.597
What are you saying,
exactly?

48:19.630 --> 48:21.366
It just- there comes a point,
Olivia,

48:21.399 --> 48:24.135
where you have to decide
how you want things.

48:24.169 --> 48:26.972
Well, I guess we haven't reached
that point yet, have we?

48:27.005 --> 48:28.940
Well, apparently we haven't.

48:28.974 --> 48:30.008
You know what?

48:30.041 --> 48:31.376
I'm gonna say goodnight.

48:31.409 --> 48:33.111
It feels late.

48:34.812 --> 48:35.346
Well, you know what they say,
never go to bed mad,

48:35.380 --> 48:35.880
just stay up and fight.

48:35.913 --> 48:38.216
That's for couples!

49:21.159 --> 49:23.228
How can I help you?

49:23.261 --> 49:25.363
What is a personal
ice sculpture?

49:27.265 --> 49:30.301
I don't
understand the question.

49:30.335 --> 49:32.137
You and me both.

49:49.054 --> 49:50.588
Wyatt Earp.

49:53.258 --> 49:56.561
Wyatt Earp is famous for
the gunfight at the OK corral.

49:56.594 --> 50:02.300
Wyatt Earp is also known as
a lawman, a saloon keeper,

50:02.333 --> 50:03.368
a gambler.

50:03.401 --> 50:04.569
What're you doing?

50:04.602 --> 50:05.603
Oh, hey.

50:05.636 --> 50:07.505
Just uh, Googling.

50:07.538 --> 50:09.107
Wyatt Earp?

50:09.140 --> 50:11.476
Yeah, I was thinking of writing
a country song.

50:11.509 --> 50:12.743
Or um, buying a horse.

50:12.777 --> 50:16.514
Dad, I really wish you'd stop
worrying about my relationship

50:16.547 --> 50:18.249
and focus on your own.

50:18.283 --> 50:20.118
Unless you wanna be alone
with the ducks again.

50:20.151 --> 50:20.985
I like the ducks.

50:21.018 --> 50:23.388
Because they fly south
for the winter?

50:23.421 --> 50:25.256
Hey, it's not like
I'm not trying, here.

50:25.290 --> 50:26.791
She's completely
taken over.

50:26.824 --> 50:28.293
Even my desk.

50:28.326 --> 50:30.195
It's now a partner's desk,
and she's moving things

50:30.228 --> 50:31.262
and she's staging things-

50:31.296 --> 50:33.264
This place needed
change, dad.

50:33.298 --> 50:35.466
It's silly to get upset
about a desk.

50:35.500 --> 50:37.368
And do you know how long
I've been trying to get you

50:37.402 --> 50:39.737
to cover those hideous chairs
in the lobby?

50:39.770 --> 50:40.805
It's like your music.

50:40.838 --> 50:42.740
You can't just keep singing
the same old songs,

50:42.773 --> 50:44.409
you need to write new ones.

50:44.442 --> 50:45.042
Don't do that.

50:45.076 --> 50:46.677
Don't use a music analogy.

50:46.711 --> 50:48.746
I learned from the master.

50:48.779 --> 50:52.550
Look, I know you're used to
running this place by yourself

50:52.583 --> 50:53.718
but you wanted a partner.

50:53.751 --> 50:56.687
Yes, a silent partner and it
wasn't supposed to be her.

50:56.721 --> 50:58.456
Ok, so it's complicated
but it's new

50:58.489 --> 51:01.326
and you'll get used to things
and, dad,

51:01.359 --> 51:04.862
I really think you two
make a good team.

51:04.895 --> 51:08.766
And there's no "i" in "team",
right?

51:08.799 --> 51:11.636
A music analogy
and a sports analogy?

51:11.669 --> 51:13.171
Really?

51:15.173 --> 51:18.409
Ok. I will try to be
more hospitable.

51:18.443 --> 51:20.511
You are in the hospitality
business.

51:20.545 --> 51:21.546
Mmmhmm.

51:21.579 --> 51:24.182
Welcome to the partnership
at Willow Lake Inn.

51:25.783 --> 51:27.652
Here.

51:27.685 --> 51:29.354
Take Wyatt Earp out to dinner.

51:32.657 --> 51:34.359
Thanks, dad.

51:50.608 --> 51:51.776
Got a delivery, Mick.

51:51.809 --> 51:53.911
Thanks, Jerry.

51:53.944 --> 51:56.714
It's not for you,
it's for Olivia Parsons?

51:56.747 --> 51:58.649
Oh, yeah, I'll take it.

51:58.683 --> 52:00.785
Wow, you've really made some
changes around here.

52:00.818 --> 52:02.553
The place has never looked
this good.

52:02.587 --> 52:04.355
Yeah, a lot of changes.

52:04.389 --> 52:06.291
Well, let me know
if you're hiring.

52:06.324 --> 52:08.193
I could always use
a second job.

52:08.226 --> 52:10.228
I'll let management know.

52:12.230 --> 52:15.933
Could you also get management
to approve the new menu?

52:15.966 --> 52:19.770
I'll try but management's
very busy.

52:19.804 --> 52:21.672
Hmm-mmm.

52:21.706 --> 52:24.542
You know, this place really
has never looked so good.

52:32.683 --> 52:33.551
Hey, mom.

52:33.584 --> 52:34.785
Hi, honey.

52:34.819 --> 52:37.922
Don't worry, the Gordon house
is staged and it looks fab.

52:37.955 --> 52:40.791
Oh, actually I just called
to tell you I miss you.

52:40.825 --> 52:42.427
I miss you, too.

52:42.460 --> 52:43.561
How's it going?

52:43.594 --> 52:44.795
The wedding?

52:44.829 --> 52:46.564
No, you and Mick.

52:46.597 --> 52:48.199
And the new chapter.

52:48.233 --> 52:50.801
Actually, I wouldn't mind
skipping this chapter.

52:50.835 --> 52:51.969
I knew it.

52:52.002 --> 52:53.804
You're taking over the Inn,
aren't you?

52:53.838 --> 52:55.806
Or the entire state of Vermont?

52:55.840 --> 52:59.644
No, I- I'm not.

52:59.677 --> 53:01.812
Well, maybe a little.

53:01.846 --> 53:04.582
But I- I'm trying not to.

53:04.615 --> 53:06.717
Mom, take a step back.

53:06.751 --> 53:08.453
Or maybe two.

53:08.486 --> 53:09.354
You're right.

53:09.387 --> 53:09.954
Ok.

53:09.987 --> 53:12.523
I'm... I'm stepping.

53:13.991 --> 53:15.693
Oh, hey honey,
I gotta go.

53:15.726 --> 53:17.328
Tell him I say hi!

53:17.362 --> 53:17.728
I will.

53:17.762 --> 53:18.729
I love you.

53:18.763 --> 53:19.430
Love you.

53:19.464 --> 53:20.498
Mwah.

53:25.503 --> 53:26.571
Delivery.

53:26.937 --> 53:28.373
Oh.

53:28.906 --> 53:29.740
Thank you.

53:29.774 --> 53:31.976
Personalized sculptures?

53:32.009 --> 53:33.678
You don't even wanna ask.

53:40.685 --> 53:42.253
I want to apologize.

53:43.888 --> 53:45.089
Me too.

53:45.122 --> 53:47.992
I think I kinda dropped you
on purpose on the dance floor.

53:48.025 --> 53:50.461
I think I kinda have been
over-involved.

53:50.495 --> 53:53.431
The truth is I think you're
doing a really good job.

53:53.464 --> 53:53.764
Really?

53:53.798 --> 53:55.032
Yeah.

53:55.065 --> 53:57.568
I'm just having a little trouble
getting used to working for you-

53:57.602 --> 53:58.503
I mean with you.

53:59.537 --> 54:02.039
Well, if you ever wanna
jump in on the nup-ops

54:02.072 --> 54:03.541
feel free to say "I do".

54:03.941 --> 54:04.609
That's ok.

54:04.642 --> 54:05.042
Are you sure?

54:05.075 --> 54:06.344
I'm sure.

54:10.681 --> 54:11.816
Come on.

54:13.684 --> 54:15.252
Where are we going?

54:19.089 --> 54:20.825
Are you sure we should
be doing this?

54:20.858 --> 54:23.828
I think we're allowed to take
an hour to ourselves.

54:23.861 --> 54:25.363
What if they need us?

54:25.396 --> 54:26.631
I'm sure they can fend
for themselves.

54:26.664 --> 54:29.534
And if Corrine needs us
she'll find us.

54:29.567 --> 54:32.337
Yeah, well I just hope she
makes it through this wedding.

54:32.370 --> 54:34.572
I hope we make it
through this wedding.

55:00.765 --> 55:04.602
Have I told you lately how smart
and mature Julie is?

55:04.635 --> 55:05.536
Thanks.

55:05.570 --> 55:08.906
Yeah, she is a great judge
of character.

55:08.939 --> 55:11.008
Ok, did she put you up
to this?

55:11.041 --> 55:13.077
No.

55:13.110 --> 55:14.545
They're too young to be
so serious.

55:14.579 --> 55:17.348
Awe, they're the same age
we were when we met.

55:17.382 --> 55:19.116
And look how we turned out.

55:19.149 --> 55:21.852
We're here together now,
aren't we?

55:21.886 --> 55:22.920
That we are.

55:26.023 --> 55:28.559
So I got an offer on my house.

55:28.593 --> 55:29.560
Already?

55:29.594 --> 55:30.761
Yeah.

55:30.795 --> 55:32.697
Congratulations.

55:32.730 --> 55:34.098
Are you gonna take it?

55:34.131 --> 55:35.866
I'm not sure.

55:35.900 --> 55:37.334
Hmm.

55:42.473 --> 55:46.777
Do you think I made a mistake
by coming here?

55:46.811 --> 55:48.913
Let's just say it hasn't gone
as I'd planned

55:48.946 --> 55:52.450
but whatever does go as planned?

55:52.483 --> 55:54.685
Yeah, well, I guess
we can decide

55:54.719 --> 55:56.654
after the rice is thrown
on Sunday.

55:56.687 --> 55:59.657
Unless, of course, the bride
changes the rice to kale chips.

56:02.026 --> 56:03.561
Woo. Four skips.

56:06.831 --> 56:08.433
Oooh, five.

56:08.466 --> 56:09.033
No, it wasn't.

56:09.066 --> 56:09.934
That was five.

56:09.967 --> 56:10.735
That was not five.

56:10.768 --> 56:11.602
Then you can't count.

56:11.636 --> 56:13.003
Alright, I'll make you
a little bet.

56:13.037 --> 56:13.771
Name it.

56:13.804 --> 56:14.905
Ok.

56:14.939 --> 56:17.007
If I win you move those chairs
back to where they were

56:17.041 --> 56:17.942
in front of the fireplace.

56:17.975 --> 56:19.544
Oh, ok.

56:19.577 --> 56:23.514
And if I win you have
to ease up on Wyatt.

56:23.548 --> 56:24.014
Really?

56:24.048 --> 56:26.150
Yes.

56:26.183 --> 56:27.051
Alright, you're on.

56:27.084 --> 56:27.985
You go first.

56:28.018 --> 56:28.986
Ok.

56:33.624 --> 56:34.892
Oh, nice.

56:34.925 --> 56:35.926
Beat that.

56:45.836 --> 56:46.437
This is nice.

56:46.471 --> 56:48.473
Just doing nothing.

56:53.678 --> 56:56.180
I'm gonna put this here just
in case any wedding stuff.

56:56.213 --> 56:57.047
I'm watching you.

56:58.783 --> 57:02.620
I know I've gotten
a little out of hand.

57:02.653 --> 57:03.187
Uh huh.

57:03.220 --> 57:04.254
It's just that this is

57:04.288 --> 57:07.958
the most important
day of our lives.

57:11.028 --> 57:13.230
Oh. It's my sister.

57:13.263 --> 57:17.001
She wants to know if she
should bring her confetti gun

57:17.034 --> 57:18.168
for the post-nuptials.

57:18.202 --> 57:19.970
Mmm, tell her "no".

57:20.004 --> 57:22.707
But thanks for thinking of us.

57:22.740 --> 57:23.741
You're right.

57:23.774 --> 57:25.442
Unnecessary.

57:28.078 --> 57:29.113
Oh, look!

57:29.146 --> 57:31.048
Someone's getting their
wedding photographs taken.

57:31.081 --> 57:32.016
Let's go see.

57:32.049 --> 57:33.117
Corrine.

57:33.150 --> 57:35.152
But this isn't our wedding,
it's somebody else's.

57:35.185 --> 57:37.955
Isn't anyone single
in this town?

57:37.988 --> 57:41.726
Honey, please, can we just sit
and finish our coffee?

57:46.597 --> 57:48.499
Awe, look at her veil.

57:48.533 --> 57:49.767
I love that.

57:49.800 --> 57:52.236
They're like two people
on top of a cake.

57:52.269 --> 57:55.506
You mean the two
plastic figurines?

57:55.540 --> 57:56.841
You know what I mean.

57:56.874 --> 57:58.242
I'm afraid I do.

57:58.275 --> 58:01.045
Tell me that cummerbund
doesn't look great.

58:01.078 --> 58:02.012
Uh huh.

58:02.046 --> 58:02.747
Yeah.

58:02.780 --> 58:03.180
Mmmhmm.

58:03.213 --> 58:03.681
It's perfect.

58:03.714 --> 58:04.048
You love it.

58:04.081 --> 58:04.949
I love it.

58:11.622 --> 58:12.823
You're a genius.

58:12.857 --> 58:13.958
No, you are.

58:13.991 --> 58:15.125
Let's just say we both are.

58:15.159 --> 58:16.761
What's going on?

58:17.895 --> 58:18.996
...guys?

58:19.029 --> 58:20.230
What's going on, guys?

58:20.264 --> 58:21.165
For Chris and Corrine.

58:21.198 --> 58:22.633
It's their couple's logo.

58:23.934 --> 58:24.869
You did this?

58:24.902 --> 58:25.903
It was mostly Wyatt.

58:27.171 --> 58:28.005
It's good.

58:28.038 --> 58:29.139
Thanks, Mr. Turner.

58:29.173 --> 58:31.308
We're gonna print it on
the napkins and centrepieces.

58:31.341 --> 58:33.578
You may wanna run that
by the bride and groom.

58:33.611 --> 58:34.311
Check that, the bride.

58:34.344 --> 58:35.580
Oh, I already did.

58:35.613 --> 58:36.747
She loves it.

58:36.781 --> 58:37.081
Really?

58:37.114 --> 58:38.115
Mmmhmm.

58:38.148 --> 58:39.550
I've also been working on
a logo for the Inn.

58:39.584 --> 58:41.251
I assume management
ok'd this?

58:41.285 --> 58:42.219
Yep.

58:42.252 --> 58:43.688
It's just a rough sketch, but...

58:47.191 --> 58:48.125
What's this?

58:48.158 --> 58:51.128
Uh... Ju- Julie and Wyatt.

58:51.161 --> 58:52.597
It's our couple's logo.

58:52.630 --> 58:53.831
Yeah, I'm gonna put
a stop to that.

58:53.864 --> 58:54.364
Dad.

58:54.398 --> 58:55.099
No go with the logo.

58:55.132 --> 58:55.900
You guys just met.

58:55.933 --> 58:57.668
We met, like, half
a semester ago.

58:57.702 --> 58:58.869
What is that, like three weeks?

58:58.903 --> 58:59.303
Eight weeks.

58:59.336 --> 59:00.638
And four days.

59:00.671 --> 59:01.572
Maybe your dad's right.

59:01.606 --> 59:03.608
We really haven't been dating
that long.

59:05.275 --> 59:06.777
Thank you, Wyatt.

59:06.811 --> 59:09.313
Ok, we'll save it for later.

59:09.346 --> 59:11.181
Like our six month anniversary.

59:11.215 --> 59:12.650
Don't push it, kid.

59:12.683 --> 59:13.450
And I want a re-match.

59:13.483 --> 59:15.753
And next time I pick
the stones.

59:19.924 --> 59:21.158
Hard to explain.

59:26.964 --> 59:28.599
Wow, nice.

59:30.400 --> 59:31.969
Look at the lake.

59:32.002 --> 59:33.070
Oh my goodness.

59:33.103 --> 59:33.971
See you inside. Bye.

59:34.705 --> 59:35.139
Hi!

59:40.711 --> 59:41.345
Hi!

59:41.378 --> 59:43.914
You look so beautiful.

59:43.948 --> 59:44.414
Thanks.

59:44.448 --> 59:46.116
There's our bride.

59:46.150 --> 59:47.217
Hi, dad!

59:47.251 --> 59:49.019
Hello.

59:49.053 --> 59:49.654
Hi.

59:49.687 --> 59:51.255
This is just so exciting.

59:51.288 --> 59:53.758
I know, isn't this exciting?

59:53.791 --> 59:55.092
And isn't this place great?

59:55.125 --> 59:55.893
Oh, it's lovely.

59:55.926 --> 59:56.393
Stunning.

59:56.426 --> 59:57.494
How was the drive?

59:57.527 --> 01:00:00.030
Oh, your mother talked about
weddings the entire way.

01:00:00.064 --> 01:00:00.698
Well, why wouldn't I?

01:00:00.731 --> 01:00:02.633
Our girl is getting married.

01:00:02.667 --> 01:00:04.134
That's 98.

01:00:04.168 --> 01:00:05.102
What?

01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:05.970
I'm counting how many times
she says that.

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:11.075
Well, I promised this would
be an unforgettable wedding

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:11.742
and it will be.

01:00:11.776 --> 01:00:14.278
I have every minute planned.

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:15.980
Schedules.

01:00:16.013 --> 01:00:19.884
Cocktail reception at 4:00,
rehearsal at 6:00,

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:24.121
dinner at 7:00 followed by
the Chinese lantern lighting.

01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:26.256
And that's just
the pre-wedding.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.092
I think you may have
outdone me.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:29.126
That's impossible.

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:29.894
Also true.

01:00:31.028 --> 01:00:32.730
I can't imagine what you have
planned for Sunday.

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:34.665
My lips are sealed.

01:00:34.699 --> 01:00:36.033
So where's Chris?

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:37.401
Getting ready, I think.

01:00:37.434 --> 01:00:39.036
Wait until you see him.

01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:40.237
We went shopping.

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:42.973
He looks completely
transformed.

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:43.373
Come on!

01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:48.445
There he is.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:49.880
Hey, guys.

01:00:49.914 --> 01:00:51.015
Chris.

01:00:52.783 --> 01:00:54.018
Oh.

01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:56.186
Oh yeah, he's totally
transformed... with dirt.

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:13.037
Ok, what do you think?

01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:16.907
Veil or no veil?

01:01:16.941 --> 01:01:18.308
Veil.

01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:19.309
It's not too much?

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:20.277
No, it's your wedding.

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:22.446
It's never too much.

01:01:22.479 --> 01:01:24.448
Are you sure?

01:01:24.481 --> 01:01:26.283
That's a little...
that's a little...

01:01:27.117 --> 01:01:28.953
That's a little much.

01:01:30.821 --> 01:01:33.323
Remember when we were kids
and we used to plan

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:36.326
our seating charts and make
our menus?

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.728
Chicken or fish?

01:01:37.762 --> 01:01:40.230
Tented yard or
indoor ballroom...

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:41.999
Invitations engraved
or embossed?

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:43.200
And we checked the weather
in countries

01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:44.434
where exotic flowers
were from.

01:01:47.104 --> 01:01:47.637
Oh, wait.

01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:49.473
What about sugar cubes?

01:01:49.506 --> 01:01:51.108
Oh, they had to match
the centrepieces.

01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:51.842
Right?

01:01:51.876 --> 01:01:53.010
Mmmhmm.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.515
I was always your maid
of honour.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.951
And now I get to be yours.

01:02:00.985 --> 01:02:06.156
All I want is for you to have
the most beautiful wedding ever.

01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:09.159
You mean the second most
beautiful wedding ever.

01:02:09.193 --> 01:02:09.994
That's true.

01:02:10.027 --> 01:02:11.361
It's a little bit hard
to top mine.

01:02:11.395 --> 01:02:12.329
We'll see.

01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:13.831
Corrine?

01:02:13.864 --> 01:02:15.265
Oh, I'm trying on my dress.

01:02:15.299 --> 01:02:16.533
Again?

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:17.434
Don't come in!

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:18.535
It's bad luck.

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.270
Haven't I seen that
dress already?

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:21.371
I returned that one.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:22.406
This is a new dress.

01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:24.041
I'll be down in a sec.

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:30.981
Wait until you see
my rehearsal dress.

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:43.393
This is the biggest
rehearsal dinner

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:45.262
in the history of
rehearsal dinners.

01:03:00.577 --> 01:03:02.212
There he is.

01:03:02.246 --> 01:03:05.449
Oh, Lisa, you look fabulous.

01:03:05.482 --> 01:03:07.818
Thank you. Almost.

01:03:07.852 --> 01:03:09.319
You look so good.

01:03:09.353 --> 01:03:10.855
You too.

01:03:10.888 --> 01:03:12.156
Dad, you're looking good.

01:03:12.189 --> 01:03:12.789
You look dapper.

01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:14.358
Thank you, sir, thank you.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.866
Squeeze by here.

01:03:29.874 --> 01:03:31.475
Signature cocktail?

01:03:31.508 --> 01:03:33.010
Is it strong?

01:03:33.043 --> 01:03:33.978
Very.

01:03:35.379 --> 01:03:37.114
Cheers.

01:03:38.515 --> 01:03:41.051
Woah, it's got a kick to it.

01:03:41.085 --> 01:03:41.751
What is it?

01:03:41.785 --> 01:03:43.921
It's called the Corrine Fizz.

01:03:43.954 --> 01:03:45.522
Mmm. Of course it is.

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:49.293
Wait until you
see the appetizers.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:52.562
You know anything
about the appetizers?

01:03:52.596 --> 01:03:55.132
Let's just hope your suit's
fire retardant.

01:03:56.633 --> 01:03:58.368
I might need you to top me
off there.

01:03:59.436 --> 01:04:01.171
This thing is strangling me.

01:04:01.205 --> 01:04:03.140
Just hang in there,
it won't be long now.

01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:06.410
There's the bride.

01:04:09.379 --> 01:04:10.214
There she is.

01:04:25.996 --> 01:04:26.630
Wow.

01:04:26.663 --> 01:04:28.198
What do you think?

01:04:28.232 --> 01:04:32.236
You look beautiful.

01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:38.342
And you look very handsome
and uncomfortable in that suit.

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:42.179
Look what my mom brought.

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:44.081
Oh. What is that?

01:04:44.114 --> 01:04:47.417
It's something old, and
my dress is something new.

01:04:47.451 --> 01:04:50.220
Now all I need is something
borrowed and something blue.

01:04:50.254 --> 01:04:52.556
Well, we did borrow the money
to put on this wedding-

01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:53.657
Chris...

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:55.993
And I'm pretty sure I'm turning
blue from this tie.

01:05:01.431 --> 01:05:02.399
Better?

01:05:02.432 --> 01:05:03.333
A little.

01:05:03.367 --> 01:05:04.068
Hmm.

01:05:04.101 --> 01:05:06.170
Should have gone
for the bow tie.

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:10.374
Oh, you!

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:13.677
You could not have chosen
a more perfect place.

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:16.113
And you know the saying
a June wedding.

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:17.547
When you're
married in June

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:20.150
you're a bride
all your life.

01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:23.487
I have to show you something.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.723
My girls are really into
their weddings, aren't they?

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:27.691
I barely noticed.

01:05:27.724 --> 01:05:28.425
Yeah.

01:05:29.459 --> 01:05:31.428
Yeah, and you look just
like me at my wedding.

01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:32.696
Like a deer in headlights.

01:05:32.729 --> 01:05:33.563
That obvious?

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:34.431
Yeah.

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:35.665
But you know, marrying
Corrine's mother

01:05:35.699 --> 01:05:37.401
was the best thing I ever did.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:39.003
And you did it twice.

01:05:39.036 --> 01:05:41.071
Yeah, well that- that vow
renewal thing,

01:05:41.105 --> 01:05:42.572
that wasn't my idea.

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:45.275
Gotta go with the flow, right?

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.112
Appetizers, everyone.

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:55.585
Hey, Mick.

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:56.686
Hey.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.088
First wedding here
in a while, huh?

01:05:58.122 --> 01:05:59.556
Yeah, hopefully not the last.

01:05:59.589 --> 01:06:00.724
You know, they are keeping me
so busy

01:06:00.757 --> 01:06:02.459
at that new place down the road.

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:03.593
Don't remind me.

01:06:03.627 --> 01:06:05.562
Then I won't remind you
that I've gotta be back there

01:06:05.595 --> 01:06:07.731
in about an hour
for another rehearsal.

01:06:07.764 --> 01:06:09.133
I'll have you out of here
in 30 minutes.

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:11.601
Right before the Chinese
lantern ceremony.

01:06:11.635 --> 01:06:15.205
Oh, you know, I saw one of those
at the new place last week.

01:06:15.239 --> 01:06:16.373
Really nice.

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:21.745
Wow, this is a lot of people
for a rehearsal.

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:22.612
How are you?

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:24.414
Oh, good, how are you?

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:25.715
Why don't you go ahead
and sit down there?

01:06:25.749 --> 01:06:27.284
Ladies, you can sit down here.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:28.285
Ok. Thanks.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:31.655
Hi guys, the rehearsal
is about to get started.

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:33.623
Ok, here we go.

01:06:49.806 --> 01:06:52.342
Everyone please be seated.

01:06:52.376 --> 01:06:55.011
Chris, not you.

01:06:57.114 --> 01:06:59.283
Corrine and Chris, tomorrow
it will be my honour

01:06:59.316 --> 01:07:02.252
to unite you as man and wife.

01:07:02.286 --> 01:07:04.388
I'll save my blessings
until then,

01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:07.391
following which the choir
will sing a beautiful song,

01:07:07.424 --> 01:07:09.559
the bride's sister
will read a poem.

01:07:09.593 --> 01:07:12.762
We'll reserve the release
of the doves until tomorrow.

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:13.630
Doves?

01:07:13.663 --> 01:07:15.099
They're romantic.

01:07:15.132 --> 01:07:16.200
And good luck.

01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:20.670
And I believe we have a rather
unique ring bearer.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:33.350
Is that... our rings
on a drone?

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:37.321
Unforgettable, right?

01:07:49.233 --> 01:07:50.200
Oh no.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.437
Ok, oh my goodness.

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:54.738
Don't worry, everyone.

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:55.705
Everything is gonna be ok.

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:57.107
We'll find them.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.589
Hey, are you alright?

01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:14.258
Maybe this is fate.

01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:16.193
Actually I think it's more
of a mechanical difficulty.

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:17.294
What if it's not, Mick?

01:08:17.327 --> 01:08:20.197
What if this is my future now?

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:23.200
Doves and lanterns and drones,
are you kidding me?!

01:08:23.233 --> 01:08:25.469
Let's not lose sight
of something.

01:08:25.502 --> 01:08:26.470
You love her, you know.

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:27.737
She's the one.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:28.904
These things are gonna happen,
you know.

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:32.341
You want things, she wants
things, and you compromise.

01:08:32.376 --> 01:08:33.910
I'm guessing you
walked away.

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:36.645
Actually I drove away
on a tour bus, so it's...

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.747
But you left because you knew
Olivia wasn't right for you.

01:08:38.782 --> 01:08:41.385
No, actually she was right
for me, I just-

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:42.919
So why aren't you together now?

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.888
Well, it's complicated.

01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:46.390
You like being single.

01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:48.292
You can do whatever you want.

01:08:48.325 --> 01:08:48.925
You can go on the road-

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:49.926
No. No, no.

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.361
That's not what
I'm saying here-

01:08:51.395 --> 01:08:52.229
You're free.

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:53.529
Hey, Mick, thank you.

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:54.930
I really needed this talk.

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:56.700
Hey, Chris!

01:08:56.733 --> 01:08:57.634
I found them!

01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:58.868
I found them!

01:09:16.786 --> 01:09:17.720
Hey.

01:09:22.459 --> 01:09:24.261
What is it?

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:26.430
What's wrong?

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:30.634
Corrine, I have been trying
to go along with all these plans

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:35.872
and packages but this wedding
has become more important

01:09:35.904 --> 01:09:37.974
to you than our marriage.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:40.910
This isn't us.

01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:43.546
At least...

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.448
it's not me.

01:09:45.482 --> 01:09:47.716
And I don't know how I can
go through with our marriage

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:50.819
when I'm pretty sure you want
somebody else

01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:52.822
to be your groom.

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:54.258
What?

01:09:57.561 --> 01:09:58.362
I'm sorry.

01:09:58.395 --> 01:10:01.498
I uh... I can't do this.

01:10:39.769 --> 01:10:43.006
I ruined everything
and now he's gone.

01:10:43.039 --> 01:10:44.741
I'm so sorry, honey.

01:10:44.774 --> 01:10:46.276
Me too.

01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:48.778
It's like we all got swept up
in this fantasy.

01:10:48.812 --> 01:10:49.946
I stopped listening to him.

01:10:49.979 --> 01:10:54.651
I lost sight of who we are.

01:10:54.684 --> 01:10:57.887
Who we were.

01:10:57.921 --> 01:11:00.424
You know, I never told you
this before

01:11:00.457 --> 01:11:04.728
but Aaron almost broke up
with me over our wedding.

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:05.629
He did?

01:11:05.662 --> 01:11:06.630
Yeah.

01:11:06.663 --> 01:11:07.997
I never told you because
I wanted you to think

01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:09.032
everything was perfect.

01:11:09.065 --> 01:11:12.436
It was far from perfect.

01:11:12.469 --> 01:11:15.805
The only thing perfect about it
was that we ended up together.

01:11:15.839 --> 01:11:19.976
And I practically forced your
father into that vow renewal.

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:22.779
At least dad didn't walk out
on you.

01:11:22.812 --> 01:11:25.382
Well, he might have if
we weren't already married.

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:27.651
The point is, is that there's
no such thing

01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:29.653
as a perfect wedding.

01:11:29.686 --> 01:11:32.389
And there's no such thing
as a perfect couple.

01:11:32.422 --> 01:11:35.325
But as long as you love him
then who cares, right?

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.362
You do love him, don't you?

01:11:41.565 --> 01:11:42.832
I really do.

01:11:45.969 --> 01:11:47.337
What did you say to him?

01:11:47.371 --> 01:11:48.505
Nothing, really.

01:11:48.538 --> 01:11:50.607
Well, he left after
you guys talked.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.608
He asked about us

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:53.042
and I gave him a little
background information.

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:53.843
Oh, great.

01:11:53.877 --> 01:11:55.078
It was meant as
a cautionary tale.

01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:56.546
Well, you drove him off.

01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:57.747
Well, I might have misspoken,
Olivia,

01:11:57.781 --> 01:11:59.949
but it was heading in this
direction one way or the other.

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:01.150
What does that mean?

01:12:01.184 --> 01:12:04.053
It means that the platinum
package is what drove him off

01:12:04.087 --> 01:12:05.822
and you are an enabler.

01:12:05.855 --> 01:12:06.990
Oh, what?

01:12:07.023 --> 01:12:09.426
You helped turn this wedding
into a three-ring circus.

01:12:09.459 --> 01:12:10.860
It's what the bride wanted.

01:12:10.894 --> 01:12:11.961
What about what
the groom wants?

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:13.563
The groom could have
spoken up!

01:12:13.597 --> 01:12:15.098
Well, how do you stop
a runaway train, Olivia?

01:12:15.131 --> 01:12:16.966
You jump on the tracks
and just let it hit you?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.135
Just because I moved a few
things around in this place

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:21.004
doesn't make me
a runaway train.

01:12:21.037 --> 01:12:21.905
A few things?

01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:23.540
How about everything?

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:25.542
I thought you wanted me here.

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:26.610
Yes! I do.

01:12:26.643 --> 01:12:28.645
As- as my girlfriend,
not as a business partner.

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:30.714
You are so involved in this
wedding I have no idea

01:12:30.747 --> 01:12:31.981
if there's an "us" anymore.

01:12:32.015 --> 01:12:32.982
It's not about us.

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:34.718
Yeah, well maybe it is.

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.488
Did you hear all that?

01:12:38.522 --> 01:12:39.288
Yeah.

01:12:39.322 --> 01:12:41.024
I think everyone heard
all that.

01:12:41.057 --> 01:12:43.059
They got more on their minds
than us.

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:46.663
What do we do with 36
personal ice sculptures?

01:12:48.432 --> 01:12:49.433
Let them melt, I guess.

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:01.745
There goes the bride.

01:13:03.647 --> 01:13:05.915
Folks, could I have your
attention please?

01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:12.922
Um... I wish we could say we've
never had this happen before

01:13:12.956 --> 01:13:17.761
but... it has.

01:13:17.794 --> 01:13:22.966
Um... the thing is,
love is messy, right?

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:26.670
And sometimes the person
you're with can seem annoying

01:13:26.703 --> 01:13:31.508
and infuriating and maybe
a little crazy.

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:40.650
But sometimes it all works out
in the end.

01:13:40.684 --> 01:13:42.986
Eventually.

01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:46.756
Uh, in the meantime we have
chicken, fish, and pasta

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:49.859
followed by personalized cakes
for everyone.

01:14:01.805 --> 01:14:02.906
Chris!

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:05.074
What're you doing?

01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:06.810
Just wait.

01:14:06.843 --> 01:14:08.011
Please.

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:19.689
The first time I saw you,

01:14:19.723 --> 01:14:24.761
you were planting trees in jeans
and a dirty t-shirt

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:29.699
and I thought to myself "that's
the guy I'm gonna marry".

01:14:29.733 --> 01:14:32.101
I'm sorry I got so caught up.

01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:35.705
I don't know why I tried to turn
you into someone else

01:14:35.739 --> 01:14:37.240
because I don't want
someone else

01:14:37.273 --> 01:14:39.943
I want that guy from the park.

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:42.211
I want you and me back.

01:14:42.245 --> 01:14:44.113
Are you sure about that?

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:46.082
I'm so sure.

01:14:46.115 --> 01:14:50.119
I don't care about the cake
or the colour palate

01:14:50.153 --> 01:14:51.921
or the ice sculptures,

01:14:51.955 --> 01:14:56.693
I just care about spending
my life with you.

01:14:56.726 --> 01:14:58.795
If you'll still have me.

01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:02.966
Does that mean
no more cummerbund?

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:04.067
No cummerbund.

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:08.271
No signature cocktails,
no drones, no couple's logo-

01:15:08.304 --> 01:15:11.074
Actually, I kinda liked
that logo.

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:36.833
Excuse me, everybody.

01:15:39.002 --> 01:15:44.908
We've decided together,
after serious consideration,

01:15:44.941 --> 01:15:46.042
that we're eloping.

01:15:57.086 --> 01:15:58.354
I'm sorry if I made this worse.

01:15:58.387 --> 01:15:59.589
Or if I did.

01:15:59.623 --> 01:16:01.057
You didn't.

01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:04.961
Actually this is turning out
just the way it should have.

01:16:04.994 --> 01:16:07.263
So what now, Vegas?

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:09.132
That's up to Corrine.

01:16:09.165 --> 01:16:11.735
No, it's up to you.

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:13.670
I know a justice of the peace
in Atlantic City,

01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:15.705
he doubles as an
Elvis impersonator.

01:16:15.739 --> 01:16:17.707
Now that's an idea I like.

01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:19.375
Kidding.

01:16:20.877 --> 01:16:25.782
Or you could go back
to the original plan

01:16:25.815 --> 01:16:29.385
and have a nice intimate
ceremony in the gazebo tomorrow.

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:31.988
We could provide the ducks.

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:37.126
We're in.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.229
Yay!

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:41.364
I'm so happy.

01:17:05.421 --> 01:17:07.023
Anybody heard from Ally?

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:08.124
No.

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:10.193
Am I too late?

01:17:10.226 --> 01:17:11.795
Right on time.

01:17:11.828 --> 01:17:13.396
I thought about
what you said.

01:17:13.429 --> 01:17:16.332
If I faint you'll catch me,
right?

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:18.067
We all will, right?

01:17:18.101 --> 01:17:19.168
Ok, here we go.

01:17:19.202 --> 01:17:20.636

Please be seated.

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:32.008
Corrine and Chris, is there
something you would like to say

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:33.810
to each other?

01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:39.015
If, at the end of the day,

01:18:39.048 --> 01:18:42.819
you're married to the one
that you love,

01:18:42.852 --> 01:18:45.054
then everything
went perfectly

01:18:45.088 --> 01:18:50.794
and I'm so lucky to be marrying
the man that I love.

01:18:55.264 --> 01:19:01.805
Corrine, I love you so much
and I've never been happier

01:19:01.838 --> 01:19:05.842
than I am right now
because I get to spend

01:19:05.875 --> 01:19:10.847
the rest of my life with you,
starting with this.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.149
Uh, not just yet.

01:19:15.051 --> 01:19:17.887
I now pronounce you
man and wife

01:19:17.921 --> 01:19:20.289
and now you may kiss the bride.

01:19:35.905 --> 01:19:37.506
Ok, nothing like planning
a wedding

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:39.909
to make you never wanna
get married.

01:19:39.943 --> 01:19:40.743
Ever.

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:43.412
Or for at least ten,
twenty years.

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:45.081
Make it thirty.

01:19:47.483 --> 01:19:49.318
That wasn't so bad,
was it?

01:19:52.989 --> 01:19:55.591
And instead of wedding cake

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:58.027
we've got something
special for you.

01:19:58.061 --> 01:19:59.162
Oh no.

01:19:59.195 --> 01:20:00.163
Oh yes.

01:20:00.196 --> 01:20:02.031
Your favourite.

01:20:02.065 --> 01:20:02.899
Doughnuts!

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:06.970
Yay!

01:20:31.594 --> 01:20:32.261
Nice!

01:20:32.295 --> 01:20:33.262
Nice catch.

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:46.876
I'm so happy for you.

01:20:48.411 --> 01:20:51.480
Well, this truly
was unforgettable.

01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:52.581
Yeah.

01:20:52.615 --> 01:20:54.317
We couldn't have picked
a better place

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:55.418
to start our
lives together.

01:20:55.451 --> 01:20:56.352
Yeah.

01:20:56.385 --> 01:20:57.220
And who knows?

01:20:57.253 --> 01:20:59.322
Maybe we'll do our
vow renewal here.

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:00.189
Ha ha.

01:21:01.657 --> 01:21:03.226
Well, shall we?

01:21:03.259 --> 01:21:04.327
Just one sec.

01:21:06.529 --> 01:21:07.496
See you guys. Thank you.

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:08.664
Bye. Good luck.

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:13.236
I know I'm clearly not one
to give relationship advice

01:21:13.269 --> 01:21:15.538
seeing as I was almost left
at the altar,

01:21:15.571 --> 01:21:17.540
but it's pretty obvious

01:21:17.573 --> 01:21:19.976
that there's more going
on between you two

01:21:20.009 --> 01:21:22.678
than just the ebb
of the tide.

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:27.683
As someone who almost lost
everything over nothing,

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:30.353
don't let it slip away.

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:35.458
I guess it's never too late
for happily ever after.

01:21:37.293 --> 01:21:38.894
Excuse me.

01:21:40.263 --> 01:21:44.267
Wyatt, I uh, wanted to thank you
for helping out so much.

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:46.669
Thank you for letting me
help out, Mr. Turner.

01:21:46.702 --> 01:21:48.972
You can call me Mick.

01:21:49.005 --> 01:21:51.274
Maybe he'll call you
"dad" one day.

01:21:51.307 --> 01:21:52.141
Kidding.

01:21:52.175 --> 01:21:54.210
Uh, we're gonna go start
the clean up.

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:56.012
Thanks, you guys.

01:21:56.045 --> 01:21:57.246
Hey!

01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:00.316
This was the most
beautiful wedding.

01:22:00.349 --> 01:22:01.384
Thank you.

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:03.319
You know, my fiancé and I
were looking for a venue

01:22:03.352 --> 01:22:07.256
for our wedding in November
and I think this is it.

01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:08.157
Great.

01:22:08.191 --> 01:22:09.458
But we're only open
during the summer.

01:22:09.492 --> 01:22:10.626
Not anymore.

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:12.128
Fantastic.

01:22:12.161 --> 01:22:12.461
November?

01:22:12.495 --> 01:22:13.529
Yep.

01:22:13.562 --> 01:22:16.132
And, by the way, you guys
are the cutest couple.

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:21.104
Should we tell her
we're not a couple?

01:22:21.137 --> 01:22:24.040
No, we wouldn't want
to disappoint the bride.

01:22:27.010 --> 01:22:30.379
Well, we did it, partner.

01:22:30.413 --> 01:22:32.581
Yeah, we did.

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:34.350
Partner.

01:22:43.359 --> 01:22:46.495
I thought we frowned upon
workplace romances.

01:22:46.529 --> 01:22:48.497
That's right, we do.

01:22:55.671 --> 01:22:57.473
Yeah, I'm glad we cleared
that up.

01:23:05.648 --> 01:23:07.550
Okey dokey.
