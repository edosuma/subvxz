23:39.587 --> 23:43.791
You know? It's for
celebrities and spoiled kids.

23:44.058 --> 23:45.759
Tell that to the coroners
in Miami.

23:46.060 --> 23:48.329
That's not gonna happen.

23:48.362 --> 23:50.531
Not here, not if
I'm controlling who's buying

23:50.564 --> 23:52.566
and who's selling,
you know?

23:52.600 --> 23:54.535
This could turn
the entire tide of the war.

23:54.568 --> 23:58.372
Okay, as a colleague, I can
kind of grasp that rationale.

23:58.406 --> 24:00.374
But it's a little unnerving
that you won't at least

24:00.408 --> 24:03.211
acknowledge how...
crazy this is.

24:03.244 --> 24:05.279
Look, I get the faintest
whiff that something's off,

24:05.313 --> 24:06.880
and I shut it down,
walk away.

24:07.115 --> 24:09.383
This -- it -- it's not even
gonna come back to the agency.

24:09.417 --> 24:11.519
It's not just the agency
I'm worried about.

24:11.552 --> 24:14.388
Okay, it's not gonna
come back to me either.

24:14.422 --> 24:17.591
It's not just you
I'm worried about.

24:21.795 --> 24:23.764
Okay, let's just say
for a moment

24:23.797 --> 24:27.101
this is even possible.

24:27.135 --> 24:29.237
Have you considered what
running something this dangerous

24:29.270 --> 24:30.471
will do to you?

24:30.504 --> 24:32.740
Mentally.

24:35.409 --> 24:37.545
Come on, that --

24:37.578 --> 24:38.712
I'm fine.

24:38.746 --> 24:40.314
I'm in a much better place now.

24:40.348 --> 24:41.582
Yeah, because
you've been laying low.

24:41.615 --> 24:43.251
But what happens when
this thing ramps up?

24:43.284 --> 24:46.620
Which it will.
You don't remember Tehran?

24:46.654 --> 24:48.556
Why do you have to put
yourself in this position?

24:48.589 --> 24:50.124
Because it's important.

24:50.158 --> 24:52.726
'Cause the country's
asking me to do it.

24:52.760 --> 24:56.764
I...I mean, I thought that's
what we were doing here.

24:58.666 --> 25:01.602
Yeah, I guess it is.

25:04.805 --> 25:10.244
(train whistle blowing)

25:10.278 --> 25:15.816
(indistinct conversations)

25:15.849 --> 25:18.619
Go. Go make your call.

25:18.652 --> 25:20.854
It's fine, really. Go.

25:20.888 --> 25:22.523
Uh...

25:22.556 --> 25:25.859
-It'll just take a second.
-Mm-hmm.

25:25.893 --> 25:27.595
He really is
getting so big.

25:27.628 --> 25:29.697
(line ringing)

25:29.730 --> 25:32.533
ALEJANDRO: Hello.
Hey, how's it going?

25:32.566 --> 25:34.768
It's gonna take me days if
I have to do all these myself.

25:34.802 --> 25:36.637
Where the hell are you?

25:36.670 --> 25:39.873
Listen, I just need
a little more time.

25:39.907 --> 25:41.642
How much?

25:41.675 --> 25:45.679
I'm not sure, but, uh,
I'm gonna try to get back soon.

25:49.717 --> 25:51.552
Anything else?

25:51.585 --> 25:52.886
Uh, no.

25:53.187 --> 25:54.322
Great.

25:54.355 --> 25:55.656
(receiver clatters)

25:55.689 --> 25:57.725
(dial tone)

25:59.260 --> 26:01.362
(receiver clatters,
coin drops)

26:01.395 --> 26:03.564
JULIA:
You're doing so good.

26:03.597 --> 26:05.233
Hmm?

26:05.266 --> 26:06.634
(children shouting playfully)

26:06.667 --> 26:09.770
Y'all been here
all day, man.

26:11.004 --> 26:13.841
Hey.
You ain't find nothin'?

26:15.709 --> 26:18.579
I promise you
it's not up there, homie.

26:20.714 --> 26:22.950
Man, I told you.

26:23.251 --> 26:24.718
He wasn't gonna
give up on nothin'.

26:24.752 --> 26:27.755
Wake up, homie.

26:27.788 --> 26:30.190
Franklin.

26:30.224 --> 26:33.727
(dog barking in distance)

26:33.761 --> 26:36.564
(sighs)

26:36.597 --> 26:38.866
My money's
got to be here.

26:38.899 --> 26:40.668
(knock on door)
RAY-RAY: Lenny.

26:40.701 --> 26:41.902
(mumbling)
Shh, shh.

26:41.935 --> 26:43.971
Come on,
let's get it, bruh.

26:44.238 --> 26:46.707
(gun clicks) We're going to Fox Hills
Mall and pick up some Staceys.

26:48.742 --> 26:50.578
Come on, bruh,
they gon' sell out.

26:50.611 --> 26:53.714
You in there? Let's go!

26:53.747 --> 26:56.384
(pounding on door)

26:56.417 --> 26:57.785
Lenny!

27:00.621 --> 27:03.090
This a bitch.

27:03.324 --> 27:05.426
I'm out.

27:07.461 --> 27:09.697
(dog barking in distance)

27:09.730 --> 27:10.998
(gun clicks)

27:14.568 --> 27:15.769
No time for this shit, man.
Move.

27:15.803 --> 27:17.805
Hey, you don't like
my humming, huh?

27:17.838 --> 27:18.972
(screams)

27:19.006 --> 27:22.075
-Hold up.
-Get out my face, bruh!

27:22.310 --> 27:25.613
(screaming) Fuck you
like my humming now?

27:25.646 --> 27:26.980
(whack)

27:27.014 --> 27:28.416
(bat clatters)
Breathe, nigga.

27:28.449 --> 27:30.851
(gasps, coughs)

27:33.521 --> 27:35.723
(coughing)

27:35.756 --> 27:37.425
(gasping)

27:37.458 --> 27:39.760
(coughing)

27:39.793 --> 27:41.395
-Stand up, nigga.
-Ohh!

27:41.429 --> 27:44.832
-Where my money at, homie?!
-(groans)

27:44.865 --> 27:46.634
(screams)

27:46.667 --> 27:49.603
-Where the fuck is my money?
-Fuck you!

27:49.637 --> 27:50.838
(screaming)

27:50.871 --> 27:52.906
-Oh, God!
-Shit!

27:52.940 --> 27:54.575
-The fuck you doing?
-Shut the fuck up.

27:54.608 --> 27:58.646
Fuck off of me! (screams)

27:58.679 --> 28:00.848
Shut your ass up!

28:00.881 --> 28:03.517
-Get the fuck off of me!
-Fuck up, nigga.

28:03.551 --> 28:06.487
Nigga, get off! Aah!
(door slams)

28:06.520 --> 28:07.921
You don't know where
the money at, huh?

28:07.955 --> 28:09.523
This is fucked.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.725
(screams)

28:17.030 --> 28:18.366
You're kidding me.

28:18.399 --> 28:19.667
He's a pinche maricón?

28:19.700 --> 28:21.001
So, is it done?

28:23.070 --> 28:26.006
-No.
-Why not?

28:26.039 --> 28:28.809
-Didn't want to.
-You couldn't take them?

28:28.842 --> 28:33.681
You could have waited till he was alone.
Dije no families.

28:33.714 --> 28:34.982
He's a pinche maricón.

28:35.015 --> 28:36.350
You should have just
taken both of them.

28:36.384 --> 28:39.052
It wasn't right,
carajo.

28:41.088 --> 28:43.056
Or maybe I should
just go to my father.

28:43.090 --> 28:45.693
Tell him you killed Max.

28:45.726 --> 28:47.661
Okay.

28:47.695 --> 28:49.663
You want me dead?

28:52.533 --> 28:54.535
-(scoffs)
-Do it right now.

28:54.568 --> 28:56.036
Yeah, you don't think I'll do it?
ándele.

28:56.069 --> 28:58.406
-You don't think I'll do it?
-Stop it!

29:00.741 --> 29:02.710
Should be Enrique.

29:02.743 --> 29:04.177
No, I told you
Enrique's a killer.

29:04.211 --> 29:05.713
I'll do it, Lucia.

29:08.916 --> 29:11.485
Pero you're both
going to be there.

29:11.519 --> 29:13.954
Watch it happen.

29:15.523 --> 29:17.925
Cuando estás listo.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.502
-Get off me!
-Fuck your shit!

29:28.536 --> 29:30.170
-Shut your ass up.
-Get the fuck off me.

29:30.203 --> 29:31.705
KARVEL:
Shut your ass up, nigga.

29:31.739 --> 29:34.508
-Yeah, talk shit now.
-The fuck you doing?

29:34.542 --> 29:36.076
-Shut your ass up.
-The fuck, man?

29:36.109 --> 29:37.878
-Uh-huh.
-What are you doing?

29:37.911 --> 29:39.713
-Get your ass down, yeah.
-What now?

29:39.747 --> 29:41.515
What now?
Where the money at, homie?

29:41.549 --> 29:43.050
Where that money at?
He's killing him, man.

29:43.083 --> 29:45.185
Talk shit now.
Say something.

29:45.218 --> 29:50.023
-Get off me, man.
-Fuck me, huh?

29:50.057 --> 29:53.060
(indistinct shouting)

29:55.429 --> 29:56.764
-(screams)
-Say something now.

29:56.797 --> 29:59.132
Shit.

29:59.166 --> 30:02.436
What?

30:02.470 --> 30:03.871
-(screams)
-(grunting)

30:03.904 --> 30:05.806
(metal creaking)

30:05.839 --> 30:08.442
He ain't killing him.

30:08.476 --> 30:10.578
(thumping)

30:10.611 --> 30:12.079
He -- He giving it to him.

30:12.112 --> 30:14.515
(grunting)

30:15.749 --> 30:17.150
Say something.

30:17.184 --> 30:20.888
(metal creaking)

30:20.921 --> 30:23.190
(screaming and grunting)

30:40.207 --> 30:43.010
(busy signal)

30:44.545 --> 30:45.846
(receiver dings and clatters)

30:48.015 --> 30:51.018
Not what
you were hoping for?

30:53.453 --> 30:55.823
Is he out?

30:55.856 --> 30:57.858
No.

30:57.891 --> 30:59.026
I don't know.

30:59.059 --> 31:01.962
It's been
a huge day for him.

31:01.995 --> 31:04.498
He'll be okay.

31:13.006 --> 31:15.676
You should go, Teddy.

31:15.709 --> 31:19.212
No, that's okay.
Uh, hey, you hungry?

31:19.246 --> 31:21.114
There's this
great Mexican place.

31:21.148 --> 31:24.017
No.

31:24.051 --> 31:25.686
I'm telling you
you should go.

31:25.719 --> 31:29.623
Go do what it is
that you need to do.

31:29.657 --> 31:31.625
Um, let us
stay the night here,

31:31.659 --> 31:35.162
and then we'll be gone
in the morning.

31:35.195 --> 31:37.064
Wait, what?

31:37.097 --> 31:38.666
Uh, what?

31:41.902 --> 31:43.704
You don't
have to do this.

31:43.737 --> 31:46.139
-Do what?
-This.

31:46.173 --> 31:49.042
This thing that we do,
where you tell me

31:49.076 --> 31:51.979
what you think I want to hear
instead of telling me the truth.

31:52.012 --> 31:54.548
Okay.

31:54.582 --> 31:57.551
Uh, what's the truth?

31:57.585 --> 32:00.888
That we were stationed
together, and it was...

32:00.921 --> 32:02.255
(sighs)

32:02.289 --> 32:04.091
It was fucking great.

32:04.124 --> 32:07.828
It was romantic and exotic,
and I got pregnant.

32:07.861 --> 32:09.863
And instead of telling me
you weren't ready,

32:09.897 --> 32:11.198
you told me you loved me.

32:11.231 --> 32:14.201
Bec-- I do.

32:14.234 --> 32:17.738
I love you.
I love both of you.

32:17.771 --> 32:19.707
I know.

32:19.740 --> 32:22.175
And I know that being sent
to L.A. wasn't your choice.

32:22.209 --> 32:25.012
Yeah, that's right.
It wasn't my...choice.

32:25.045 --> 32:27.881
But now you're making
a choice to dig in here

32:27.915 --> 32:31.251
and be a part of something
that I can't support.

32:31.284 --> 32:33.053
Okay, look.
I think that you're making

32:33.086 --> 32:35.889
way more of this than it --
it's gonna be.

32:35.923 --> 32:40.628
Teddy, I think you are
making way too little of it.

32:45.999 --> 32:47.935
Look.

32:50.570 --> 32:52.740
I have money.

32:52.773 --> 32:54.808
I have
plenty of support.

32:54.842 --> 32:56.944
We'll be fine.
We are fine.

32:56.977 --> 32:58.979
We're fine.

32:59.012 --> 33:02.883
If this is what you need to do,
if this is what

33:02.916 --> 33:07.788
you think the country needs
you to do, Teddy, then do it.

33:07.821 --> 33:09.923
Please, come on, let's...
(sighs)

33:09.957 --> 33:12.960
...talk about this
when I get back to D.C.

33:15.362 --> 33:17.965
You want to come back
to D.C.?

33:20.768 --> 33:22.102
Come on.

33:28.942 --> 33:30.878
You know where we are.

33:45.726 --> 33:47.360
It's not
a bad thing, Teddy.

33:58.238 --> 34:01.709
(sighs)

34:01.742 --> 34:03.744
Hey, buddy.

34:15.388 --> 34:17.725
I love you.

34:27.768 --> 34:29.402
(whispers) Now go to sleep.

34:32.706 --> 34:34.374
Yeah.

34:34.407 --> 34:36.744
Okay.

34:41.048 --> 34:43.751
(whispering)
Can I keep this?

34:48.922 --> 34:50.791
Go to sleep.

34:57.430 --> 34:58.966
(door opens)

35:36.069 --> 35:39.072
(floor creaking)

35:49.416 --> 35:52.252
Couple grand, huh?

35:56.957 --> 36:00.994
Karvel, hold up.
That's my money.

36:05.933 --> 36:09.269
(chuckling)

36:29.489 --> 36:31.024
(dog barking in distance)

36:31.058 --> 36:32.359
(engine shuts off)

36:51.511 --> 36:53.513
(door creaks)

37:19.206 --> 37:21.909
(snoring)

37:36.556 --> 37:39.292
(speaking Spanish)

37:41.228 --> 37:43.430
órale.

37:43.463 --> 37:46.466
(snoring continues)

37:58.411 --> 37:59.746
(lighter clicks)

38:03.951 --> 38:06.219
(exhales deeply)
Know what? Maybe you can

38:06.253 --> 38:10.590
stay in the stash house,
watch over everything.

38:10.623 --> 38:13.593
Long as you don't
mind the ants.

38:18.731 --> 38:20.300
Why wrestling?

38:20.333 --> 38:23.236
Can't be the money.

38:23.270 --> 38:25.105
I just like it.

38:25.138 --> 38:26.539
(speaks Spanish)

38:26.573 --> 38:30.743
Those luchadores
were my heroes growing up.

38:30.978 --> 38:32.545
What did you think
it was going to be?

38:32.579 --> 38:34.114
Fame?

38:34.147 --> 38:35.382
(chuckles)
Ladies.

38:35.415 --> 38:38.051
I thought...

38:38.085 --> 38:43.423
it would make me feel...

38:43.456 --> 38:44.992
good.

38:47.260 --> 38:48.628
And it doesn't?

38:52.332 --> 38:53.733
(tires squealing in distance)

38:53.766 --> 38:56.003
Un carro.

39:11.384 --> 39:12.585
-(lowered voice) Pedro.
-What the fuck?

39:12.619 --> 39:15.022
Shh. Look.

39:22.062 --> 39:25.298
-He's big, that vato.
-Told you he's security.

39:28.168 --> 39:31.371
Okay, look.
I'll go to the door.

39:31.404 --> 39:34.541
He'll let me in. I'll make sure
the door's unlocked.

39:34.574 --> 39:36.443
You two go in behind me.

39:36.476 --> 39:38.411
órale.

39:44.517 --> 39:46.053
(sighs)

39:48.055 --> 39:50.157
Dale.

39:51.591 --> 39:53.026
Dale.

40:02.035 --> 40:03.336
(sighs)

40:03.370 --> 40:05.405
Just wait
till I'm inside.

40:07.174 --> 40:09.576
(opens car door)

40:21.554 --> 40:24.224
Mnh-mnh.

40:24.257 --> 40:26.359
(liquor pours)

40:26.393 --> 40:29.028
So, run it down.

40:29.062 --> 40:30.663
What happened?

40:30.697 --> 40:32.665
(dog barking in distance)

40:32.699 --> 40:34.701
Nothin' that
can't be handled.

40:34.734 --> 40:37.204
Y'all gonna save me some?
(beads rattle)

40:41.608 --> 40:43.676
Claudia?

40:43.710 --> 40:47.547
Nah. Somethin' else.

40:49.749 --> 40:52.085
What you need?

41:00.593 --> 41:02.629
I need a gun.

41:20.147 --> 41:21.814
Stop.

41:28.488 --> 41:30.757
You sure about that?

41:39.199 --> 41:41.468
I ain't your
fucking mama, man.

41:45.338 --> 41:46.739
You take that gun
out of this house,

41:46.773 --> 41:49.509
you better
be ready to use it.

41:49.542 --> 41:54.514
You pull it, you hesitate,
that's your funeral.

41:57.550 --> 42:01.788
And if you
make that mistake

42:01.821 --> 42:04.524
and your mama show up here,

42:04.557 --> 42:07.360
wilin' out of her mind...

42:10.897 --> 42:13.900
You can be sure...

42:14.201 --> 42:17.237
she'll know that I wasn't the
one that gave you that piece.

42:25.178 --> 42:27.314
(sighs)

42:32.151 --> 42:34.587
(beads rattle)

42:47.534 --> 42:49.869
(laughter on TV)

42:49.902 --> 42:52.205
(Cissy laughs)

42:52.239 --> 42:54.741
(door creaks open)

42:54.774 --> 42:57.777
(TV continues playing
indistinctly)

43:09.389 --> 43:11.758
(Cissy laughs)

43:30.877 --> 43:33.580
(Cissy laughs)

43:50.463 --> 43:52.832
(Cissy laughs)

43:56.235 --> 43:57.804
CISSY: Ah!

44:13.920 --> 44:16.656
(Cissy laughs)

44:21.928 --> 44:25.965
(TV continues indistinctly,
laughter)

44:25.998 --> 44:27.667
(laughs)

44:27.700 --> 44:29.969
You see, son...

44:30.002 --> 44:34.674
Hey. Where have
you been all day?

44:34.707 --> 44:36.443
Cho's.

44:38.378 --> 44:40.680
Hmm?
Oh, it's fine.

44:40.713 --> 44:42.449
Some shelves fell on me.

44:42.482 --> 44:45.585
Oh, my God. Let me see.

44:45.618 --> 44:48.788
It's fine.
Just kind of sore.

44:48.821 --> 44:50.923
Well, then you should think
about getting a different job.

44:50.957 --> 44:52.359
Yeah.

44:52.392 --> 44:54.694
Thinking about that.

44:54.727 --> 44:58.030
You sure you're okay?

44:58.064 --> 45:01.834
Just tired.

45:01.868 --> 45:04.437
WOMAN:
It just might work.

45:04.471 --> 45:07.474
(Arnold speaking indistinctly
on TV)

45:09.041 --> 45:11.110
This is the good part.

45:11.143 --> 45:13.045
PHILLIP:
Jumped off the balcony.

45:13.079 --> 45:15.014
ARNOLD:
What'chu talkin' about, Dad?

45:15.047 --> 45:20.186
(laughing)

45:21.721 --> 45:23.723
I love this.
