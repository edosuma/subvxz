00:18.200 --> 00:18.700
Are we clear?

00:18.700 --> 00:20.100
Yeah. Let's go.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.900
BOGOTA, COLUMBIA 2005

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Let's move.

00:31.700 --> 00:32.500
Hey!

00:41.500 --> 00:42.800
Here, take the case.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.400
Mr. Anderson.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.900
???　No need to shoot, okay?

01:00.700 --> 01:01.700
You got it, sweetheart?

01:02.800 --> 01:03.700
Yeah.

01:04.599 --> 01:05.600
Yeah, I got it.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.800
Well... give it to him.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.200
Nice shot, Mrs. Anderson.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.000
Why, thank you,
Mr. Anderson.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.500
Chuck.

01:44.000 --> 01:44.900
Hi.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.800
- Um...
- Hello, Chuck.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.500
Miss me?

02:05.200 --> 02:08.400
Hey. That was a fast date.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.800
Is everything okay
with you and Sarah?

02:09.800 --> 02:11.600
Everything,
except her ex is in town.

02:12.000 --> 02:12.300
This dude has

02:12.300 --> 02:15.600
a really nasty habit
of popping into my life

02:15.600 --> 02:17.200
at the most
inopportune of times.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.300
Stalker ex. Not awesome.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.200
Does he know
that you and Sarah are dating?

02:21.500 --> 02:23.000
Yeah. I just think he's taking
the whole

02:23.000 --> 02:24.400
"we can still be friend"
thing to heart.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.800
Don't sweat it, Chuck.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.900
This guy can't hold
a candle to you.

02:28.100 --> 02:29.800
And what does he have
that's so great?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.900
Uh, that would be good looks,

02:31.900 --> 02:33.500
sophistication,
an exciting career,

02:33.500 --> 02:35.000
and much more history
with Sarah.

02:35.000 --> 02:35.600
You know what?

02:35.600 --> 02:37.400
I'm sure that Sarah
will take care of it.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.300
This guy will be
out of your life in no time.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.200
Something tells me,
it won't be quite that simple.

02:42.900 --> 02:43.900
Do you want to talk?

02:44.500 --> 02:45.600
Watch something else?

02:46.300 --> 02:47.600
No. No, I'm good.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.000
I'm just gonna,
I'm just gonna hang.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.300
I'm fine. I'm gonna be fine.

02:50.300 --> 02:53.000
So, I'm just gonna sit here
alone,

02:53.200 --> 02:55.900
not technically, but,
you know, emotionally.

03:12.700 --> 03:13.400
Okay, look at this.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.100
This is what
I'm talking about.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.300
I'm worried about Lester
as the new assistant manager.

03:16.700 --> 03:17.700
Why, is
he making you work?

03:17.700 --> 03:20.400
Please, Chuck, I have
mad-work avoidance skills.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.100
True... true.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.000
No, he's drunk
with power, man.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.900
I once read that Mussolini
started in retail.

03:25.900 --> 03:28.100
- Really? Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

03:28.200 --> 03:28.900
It could be worse.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.000
It could be Casey.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.300
Lunch break:
Orange Orange.

03:31.300 --> 03:33.400
Yogurt again? Can't
we have a meatball sub?

03:33.400 --> 03:35.100
We're not eating, idiot.
We got a new mission.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.700
Does it have anything
to do with Bryce-

03:36.700 --> 03:38.200
- why he's in town?
- I don't know.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.200
If I know Larkin,
he's probably here

03:39.200 --> 03:40.900
for a roll in the hay
with Walker.

03:41.900 --> 03:42.600
Get down!

03:42.600 --> 03:44.200
Kick it, baby!

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Look at them.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.000
Visiting from
their Mighty Jocks

03:51.000 --> 03:53.600
sporting goods store
with their cola and tacos.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
They can't treat my store
like a frat house.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.500
Grimes... Grimes.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.900
Come here.
Come here.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.600
Get in there
and kick those ruffians out.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.800
That's Mitt and his merry band
of maniacs.

04:04.900 --> 04:07.100
Not only are the giants,
they are psychopaths.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.000
Look, I'm sorry, Morgan.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.800
Management means
making tough decisions.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.600
Now go in there
and kick them out!

04:14.200 --> 04:16.100
I got it! I got him!

04:16.100 --> 04:17.300
He's got him.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.700
You guys having a good time?

04:18.700 --> 04:21.600
Good, good. Sorry...
Can I get a second, please?

04:21.600 --> 04:23.100
One second, man.
I'm in the middle of a play.

04:25.200 --> 04:25.900
Right. Well, um...

04:25.900 --> 04:27.600
Okay. Well, obviously,
you haven't heard.

04:27.700 --> 04:28.500
Heard what?

04:29.300 --> 04:31.500
We have some new rules here
at the Buy More.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.800
Basically, uh,
we just, uh-uh...

04:33.800 --> 04:36.000
are requiring customers
to clean up after themselves

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
and allowing others to enjoy

04:38.000 --> 04:40.100
the various video game
consoles-

04:40.700 --> 04:42.900
specifically,
the Madden football, you know.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.400
And-and if it's possible,

04:44.500 --> 04:46.400
if we could all just, kind of,
as group here-

04:46.700 --> 04:48.300
myself included, okay?-

04:48.600 --> 04:50.000
use our indoor voices,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
- as my mother used to saY. 
- We're so sorry.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.900
We didn't mean to offend
anybody.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.600
We didn't know
you had new rules.

04:56.700 --> 04:57.900
I'm going to clean
up my lunch.

04:57.900 --> 05:01.200
Thank you so much, man.
I was nervous about asking you.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.600
Oh, you're just gonna...?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.200
There you go, buddy.
We're all cleaned up.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.500
And, dude...
if you ever interrupt

05:08.500 --> 05:10.000
another one of my games,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.300
gonna be your face
that gets smushed.

05:12.300 --> 05:13.300
You understand that?

05:13.300 --> 05:14.400
Per-perfect.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.800
All right, buddy. Thanks.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.500
Any idea what Bryce is
doing in town?

05:32.500 --> 05:34.000
He's not staying
with you, is he?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.500
Not now, Chuck.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.800
Is there something
you would like to share

05:36.800 --> 05:38.900
with the rest of the class,
Mr. Bartowski?

05:38.900 --> 05:40.500
No, sorry, General.

05:40.900 --> 05:41.600
Zipping it up.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.500
The Fulcrum threat is far worse
than it originally appeared.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.200
We've learned
one of their agents stole

05:46.200 --> 05:47.300
an encrypted microchip

05:47.300 --> 05:50.200
containing top secret
information out of the DNI.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.100
The information on the chip
contained

05:52.100 --> 05:56.000
highly classified intelligence-
a refresh for the new Intersect.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.900
Is there anything on that chip
that could compromise our cover?

05:59.100 --> 06:00.700
Unfortunately, yes.

06:00.700 --> 06:04.500
Agent Larkin has learned
that Fulcrum hired Von Hayes,

06:04.600 --> 06:07.300
a wealthy software magnet,
to decrypt the chip

06:07.300 --> 06:09.600
and deliver the encoded
information back to them.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.900
Mr. Hayes is throwing
a lavish party

06:11.900 --> 06:13.900
at his Bel Air estate
this evening.

06:13.900 --> 06:16.900
The finest dining,
music and food.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.100
Your job will be to pose
as a married couple

06:20.200 --> 06:21.800
and steal back the chip.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.600
See? This is what I'm talking
about, General.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.800
Finally a mission I can
sink my teeth into.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.400
Dust off the tux,
polish up the dancing shoes...

06:28.400 --> 06:29.900
No, Chuck.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.900
This mission is going to require
a real spy.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.100
Sorry I'm late.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.000
L.A. traffic's still the worst.

06:46.700 --> 06:49.100
Bryce will be posing
as Sarah's husband.

06:49.300 --> 06:51.200
Chuck, you'll be posing
as a waiter.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.400
Try and flash on and identify
the Fulcrum agent.

06:58.900 --> 07:00.100
Well, Mrs. Anderson.

07:00.100 --> 07:05.600

07:45.700 --> 07:47.800
<i>Hey, Casey.
Um, so what's the deal</i>

07:47.800 --> 07:49.500
with the... with
the mission tonight?

07:49.500 --> 07:51.200
Sarah said you were
working on the plan?

07:51.300 --> 07:52.800
Yeah, yeah, we're
making it airtight

07:52.800 --> 07:54.200
so even you can't
screw it up.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.800
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.800
So what's the scoop
with the...

07:58.800 --> 08:00.200
you know,
the Andersons?

08:00.300 --> 08:02.100
Why, you worried Bryce
is going to steal your girl?

08:02.100 --> 08:03.100
Okay, you know what?
First of all,

08:03.100 --> 08:04.500
Sarah and I are purely
professional,

08:04.500 --> 08:07.400
so I resent any accusation
otherwise.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.700
And second of all,
I can't take an interest

08:09.700 --> 08:10.700
in my coworker's mission?

08:10.700 --> 08:11.900
I mean, I figure
if I'm going to be stuck

08:11.900 --> 08:15.500
being a spy for a while now,
I think, you know,

08:15.500 --> 08:17.500
I want to learn
a little lesson from...

08:18.100 --> 08:19.200
the master.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.500
Hmm.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.600
All right, the microchip is
stored inside a vault

08:23.600 --> 08:24.800
in Von Hayes' mansion.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.000
All Bryce and Sarah
need to do,

08:26.000 --> 08:27.600
is slip out of the main ballroom
and grab it.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.100
Well, aren't people going
to be asking questions

08:29.100 --> 08:30.900
if they see them snooping
around the house?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.100
Bryce and Sarah will be
very affectionate.

08:33.100 --> 08:34.500
That way, no one will ask
them any questions

08:34.500 --> 08:35.799
when they're looking
for the vault.

08:35.900 --> 08:37.600
That's the beauty of PDA.

08:39.200 --> 08:39.799
The company really knows

08:39.799 --> 08:41.500
how to put you
into a cute outfit.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.400
We're not undercover yet, Bryce.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.300
Well, you can't be
too careful.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.600
You never know who's watching,
Mrs. Anderson.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.800
Yeah, uh... about the Andersons,

08:50.800 --> 08:52.700
I really think
that we should

08:52.800 --> 08:55.200
keep it strictly
a cover this time.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.800
Okay.
Everything all right?

08:57.800 --> 09:00.200
Yeah, it's just with Fulcrum
getting closer and closer,

09:00.200 --> 09:02.800
we should be... focused.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.700
You know,
no distractions.

09:04.700 --> 09:07.500
You're right.
Yeah... no distractions.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.100
I have to admit, though,

09:15.500 --> 09:17.500
it sure was fun while it lasted.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.400
I've always found that lunch
travels better in a bag,

09:27.400 --> 09:28.700
but maybe that's just me.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.700
Yeah. Well... Lester
made me kick the Mighty Jocks

09:31.700 --> 09:34.000
out of the home theater
so Mitt burritoed me.

09:34.100 --> 09:36.000
Buddy, what have I told you
about direct confrontation

09:36.000 --> 09:38.200
with the Mighty Jocks-
Mitt specifically?

09:38.200 --> 09:40.900
Run with my tail between my legs
and go get John Casey.

09:41.100 --> 09:41.800
I know.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.700
Man, you ever have someone
show up in your life

09:43.700 --> 09:46.300
and just make you feel
so damn small?

09:48.700 --> 09:49.800
Yeah, that...

09:50.500 --> 09:52.200
Buddy, there's always going
to be someone that's cooler

09:52.200 --> 09:53.800
or better-looking
or more athletic than us.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.900
But there's one thing
we have that they don't.

09:56.000 --> 09:56.700
I got a beard.

09:56.700 --> 09:59.900
Brains. Brains! And if
we use our brains,

09:59.900 --> 10:01.000
then we're going to be okay.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.300
You're right, dude, I know.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.400
All right, good talk.

10:03.800 --> 10:04.600
Uh...

10:05.300 --> 10:06.100
There you go.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.200
Shmutz.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.300
- Hey. 
- Hey. Hey, I was just on my way home.

10:09.300 --> 10:10.300
I got this thing to do
with Sarah.

10:10.300 --> 10:11.500
What's, what's going on?

10:11.600 --> 10:14.400
Uh, well, I went
by the Orange Orange

10:14.400 --> 10:16.000
to ask Sarah to be
a bridesmaid...

10:16.000 --> 10:17.500
That is so sweet, Ellie.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.300
Yeah. Um... Chuck,

10:20.200 --> 10:22.900
when I got there,
I saw her holding hands

10:22.900 --> 10:23.700
with another guy.

10:23.700 --> 10:25.200
I think it might be her ex.

10:27.900 --> 10:30.200
Really? Uh, did you, did you get
a good look at him?

10:30.200 --> 10:31.600
Well, I couldn't, 'cause
he was faced the other way,

10:31.600 --> 10:34.800
but, uh, dark hair, sort
of classically handsome...

10:34.800 --> 10:35.600
I don't know if I'd...

10:36.000 --> 10:37.500
I'd call him
classically handsome.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.100
Maybe from like
a weird angle

10:39.100 --> 10:41.000
or from really far away,
maybe that...

10:41.500 --> 10:42.800
They were holding hands, huh?

10:43.200 --> 10:45.500
Yeah. I'm really
sorry, Chuck.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.100
Don't be...

10:47.500 --> 10:49.200
Don't be, Elle, why?
Why be sorry?

10:49.200 --> 10:50.000
No, it's all good.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.500
She was probably just
letting him down easy.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.900
Trust me, things have never
been better between us.

10:55.700 --> 10:56.900
Kick his butt!

10:58.000 --> 10:59.500
Grimes, I thought
I told you

10:59.500 --> 11:01.600
- to toss those meatheads.
- I tried, dude.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.800
What do you want me to do?
Maybe they'll respond

11:02.800 --> 11:04.500
to somebody who's
in a position of authority.

11:04.700 --> 11:05.200
Don't you think

11:05.200 --> 11:07.100
you should lead
by example, Lester?

11:09.300 --> 11:10.800
Slovenly buffoons!

11:10.900 --> 11:12.200
Okay, all right,
listen to me.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.100
What about a plan
that doesn't require...

11:14.900 --> 11:16.400
direct confrontation?

11:19.300 --> 11:20.300
Talk to me.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.100
Pippin, he's Pippin.
Last play

11:36.100 --> 11:37.700
of the game!
This is the last play!

11:37.700 --> 11:39.000
Come on, you better
do this.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.600
Oh, oh,
what a pass!

11:40.600 --> 11:41.700
I'm takin' it to the house!

11:41.700 --> 11:43.100
Ten seconds.
Nine...

11:43.300 --> 11:44.400
- Yes!
- eight...

11:44.400 --> 11:45.300
seven...

11:46.000 --> 11:46.900
six...

11:47.700 --> 11:48.700
five...

11:49.400 --> 11:50.300
four...

11:50.800 --> 11:51.700
three...

11:52.500 --> 11:53.600
two...

12:05.200 --> 12:06.500
What the hell?

12:07.500 --> 12:09.600
That was a
game-winning drive!

12:09.600 --> 12:12.500
A game-winning
drive!

12:13.100 --> 12:14.900
And now what
does it look like?

12:15.000 --> 12:15.900
You know, kind of
hard to tell

12:15.900 --> 12:17.000
a little bit by
the glare.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.600
Super Bowl-winning drive!
Franchise mode!

12:19.600 --> 12:21.100
All-Madden!

12:21.600 --> 12:22.600
I can tell
you're upset.

12:25.100 --> 12:26.900
You could have asked us
to leave nicely.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.700
I didn't even want
to kick you guys out.

12:28.700 --> 12:29.900
I'm just an employee.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.300
My boss made me do it.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.300
Who's your boss?

12:32.300 --> 12:33.500
- Oh, come on...
- Who?

12:33.500 --> 12:35.000
The guy over there, real skinny.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.300
After work...

12:42.700 --> 12:44.100
gonna kick both your asses.

12:44.800 --> 12:45.600
Thank you.

12:45.700 --> 12:47.100
Have a nice night.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.200
You, too.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.200
What, no rose for me this time,
lover boy?

12:56.700 --> 12:57.500
Cute.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.100
We're just protecting our cover.

13:01.300 --> 13:02.400
Sales up at the
Buy More?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.100
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

13:04.100 --> 13:05.700
Buy More, Buy More is good.
We just got

13:05.700 --> 13:07.800
a new MacBook SMC
firmware update.

13:07.800 --> 13:08.600
So, you know,

13:08.600 --> 13:10.200
things are a little nutty.
Mmm.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.100
I can imagine.

13:14.800 --> 13:15.700
That's...

13:17.700 --> 13:19.800
So, uh, staying with Sarah, huh?

13:20.400 --> 13:21.400
Protecting our cover.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.600
How are things between you guys?

13:23.700 --> 13:24.400
They're good.

13:24.600 --> 13:25.900
Good, good, good. Solid.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.500
- Why? did she say something?
- No.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.500
It's just she's a beautiful girl

13:29.800 --> 13:31.300
pretending to be
your girlfriend.

13:31.300 --> 13:32.700
I was afraid you'd let
the lines get blurred

13:32.700 --> 13:33.800
and fall for her.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.300
What?
Me, fall for Sarah?

13:36.300 --> 13:37.200
Please.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.200
Hey, guys.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.600
Hey.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.500
So, how do I look?

13:45.700 --> 13:46.600
Good!

13:47.500 --> 13:48.700
Yeah, yeah,
real good.

13:48.700 --> 13:50.500
Red's not really
my color, so...

13:52.500 --> 13:53.400
I forgot...

13:54.700 --> 13:55.500
Or salmon or whatever

13:55.500 --> 13:56.500
that is.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.900
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome!

14:14.100 --> 14:17.200
As you all know, today is
yours truly's birthday.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.300
Thank you.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.500
No, no, no, no.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.100
Um, I have a lot
to be thankful for.

14:23.100 --> 14:24.900
I'm rich, handsome,

14:24.900 --> 14:26.400
an extraordinarily
gifted lover-

14:26.500 --> 14:28.500
but, most importantly,
I know how to throw one hell

14:28.500 --> 14:31.000
of party;
so let's get it on, people!

14:31.000 --> 14:32.100
Cheers!

14:40.700 --> 14:42.200
Hey, Bartowski,

14:42.400 --> 14:44.000
Von Hayes is at table eight.
Grab a bottle

14:44.000 --> 14:45.600
of wine,
see if you flash on him.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.600
Pardon me, excuse me.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.100
Any security
behind you?

15:04.200 --> 15:05.000
No.

15:05.500 --> 15:06.900
You're still a
great dancer.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.200
You're a little rusty.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.800
Yes, sir, of course.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.000
Fantastic.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.200
Will you just let me lead?

15:16.900 --> 15:17.900
No.

15:20.000 --> 15:20.600
Hey,

15:20.600 --> 15:22.100
quit screwing around, Bartowski.

15:22.100 --> 15:23.500
And get close to Von Hayes.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.000
- Oh! - Whoa, hey!

15:37.000 --> 15:38.600
- What the hell are you doing? 
- Oh!

15:38.600 --> 15:39.600
I'm so- I'm sorry.

15:39.600 --> 15:40.600
I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.200
No, no, stop! Stop!

15:42.200 --> 15:43.500
- Stop!
- Okay, you know,

15:43.500 --> 15:44.300
I'll go-
I'll get fresh

15:44.300 --> 15:46.500
bottle.
 I'm so sorry, sir. You do that.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.700
Good help is so hard
to find these days.

15:49.900 --> 15:51.400
Casey, I didn't flash
on anything.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.000
Keep looking,
get your head in the game.

15:57.600 --> 15:58.700
The camera's on the east
and west walls, cross

15:58.700 --> 16:00.300
for about two seconds.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.300
Lambada!

16:03.900 --> 16:05.400
The forbidden dance.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.700
That's
the blind spot.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.700
Get a room.

16:10.100 --> 16:10.900
Right?

16:23.700 --> 16:25.200
Oh! Oh!

16:26.600 --> 16:28.400
- Are you on drugs? That was 
- No!

16:28.400 --> 16:30.100
a thousand dollar bottle
of Lafite Rothschild.

16:30.100 --> 16:32.100
- I'm so very sorry, sir.
- You're very sorry, sir?

16:32.100 --> 16:34.100
Were you dropped as a child
from very great height?

16:34.100 --> 16:36.300
I- I actually, I couldn't
confirm or deny that.

16:36.300 --> 16:37.200
Sir, is everything
all right?

16:37.200 --> 16:38.500
Congratulations.

16:38.600 --> 16:39.900
You have succeeded
in hiring

16:39.900 --> 16:43.000
possiblY the worst
waiter in history!

16:43.700 --> 16:45.100
You heard the man, Jorge.

16:45.100 --> 16:45.800
You're fired.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.300
I'll call security
to take you out.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.300
No, no, no, no, no!

16:48.300 --> 16:49.700
No, I need this job!
Please don't fire me.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.200
- Have some compassion, some mercy! 
- Hello,

16:51.200 --> 16:53.800
Mr. Hayes, do you have
my microchip?

16:55.000 --> 16:55.900
Hello.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.300
Well, my...

16:57.300 --> 16:59.000
bosses don't like to wait.

16:59.700 --> 17:00.900
Perhaps...

17:01.100 --> 17:02.900
we could talk in private.

17:10.099 --> 17:11.000
Let's go!

17:11.300 --> 17:12.599
Hey, ho, wait, no, no.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.000
Well, just let me finish
my shift.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.000
Bartowski!

17:18.099 --> 17:19.300
Shift's over.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.599
Time to meet your maker.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.300
I'm too young,
upwardly mobile,

17:23.300 --> 17:24.599
and handsome to die.

17:25.700 --> 17:26.900
Don't worry, Morgan,

17:26.900 --> 17:28.800
I'll take care of Anna
when you're gone.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.800
I'd rather be drawn
and quartered.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.900
Let's go, Morgan.

17:32.100 --> 17:32.900
We can't go.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.700
Mitt is going
to kill us, dude!

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Hey, unhand me, now.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.600
- All right, let's get it together here. 
- What?

17:38.700 --> 17:40.100
All right,
I'm not scared of Mitt.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.400
You are crazy, man.
I am not going anywhere.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.100
That's why I get the girl.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.000
Dead...

17:47.000 --> 17:49.200
man walkin'.

17:53.800 --> 17:54.700
Oh, you know what?

17:54.700 --> 17:56.400
Holy smokes,
I just remembered!

17:56.400 --> 17:58.500
Big Mike wanted me

17:58.500 --> 18:00.100
to finish this inventory
by tomorrow morning.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.900
Morgan, you can't let a bully
like Mitt push you around.

18:02.900 --> 18:04.200
This isn't high school.

18:04.800 --> 18:05.900
No, it's worse.

18:06.900 --> 18:07.900
This is Buy More.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.800
It's all right.
It's all right.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.300
Moron.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.500
Bryce and Sarah are at the vault; 
come back to the van.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.200
No. I flashed on a FULCRUM agent
but I didn't see her face.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.800
Wait, wait, wait-
we need to know she looks like.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.400
Go back inside
and get me a real I.D.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.600
I'm locked out.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.200
Yeah, well, since I'm not
a complete idiot,

18:38.200 --> 18:40.300
like a certain someone,
by which I mean you,

18:40.300 --> 18:42.000
I tapped into the security
system.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.100
Try it now.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.300
Pretty impressive, Casey.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.900
just get in there and find
the FULCRUM agent.

18:45.900 --> 18:46.700
You got five minutes.

18:46.700 --> 18:47.500
Go!

18:51.500 --> 18:52.900
Is that Jorge?

18:57.100 --> 18:58.500
You promised us
the decrypted chip

18:58.500 --> 19:00.200
two weeks ago and instead
you're throwing

19:00.200 --> 19:01.800
- a party. 
- Well, what's the point

19:01.800 --> 19:04.100
of being rich
if you can't have a little fun?

19:04.100 --> 19:05.900
You have decrypted
the information

19:05.900 --> 19:06.600
on the chip?

19:06.600 --> 19:08.200
Yes, yes, it's all finished.

19:08.600 --> 19:09.400
The, um,

19:09.500 --> 19:10.800
question is

19:11.500 --> 19:12.400
where's my fee?

19:12.500 --> 19:14.800
Forget the 15 million.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.400
Oh, my God!

19:20.700 --> 19:22.400
I think I'll just take my chip.

19:22.700 --> 19:23.800
It's in my vault.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.900
Um... I'll take you r...

19:37.200 --> 19:38.200
I'll take you right there.

19:43.900 --> 19:45.400
Oh, Casey, Casey.

19:45.500 --> 19:46.700
The microchip is not
in the vault.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.300
It is on Von Hayes' keychain.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.700
And I also got
a really good look

19:49.700 --> 19:51.100
- at the FULCRUM agent.
- What'd she look like?

19:51.100 --> 19:52.800
Oh, my gosh, dude, so awful.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.300
I mean incredibly creepy.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.800
Think... Think psycho
elfin queen.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.900
Did you say FULCRUM?

20:00.100 --> 20:01.300
- Sarah!
- Talk to me, Casey.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.000
What's going on?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.100
Von Hayes is on the move.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.300
- Where? 
- He's headed for the front.

20:04.600 --> 20:05.500
He's got the chip.

20:06.200 --> 20:07.600
Freeze!
Federal agents.

20:07.700 --> 20:08.300
Hey,

20:08.300 --> 20:09.600
FULCRUM agent has Chuck.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.900
She's leaving out
the back door.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.800
- Sarah, what are you doing? 
- Chuck's in danger.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.400
That FULCRUM agent will kill
him if we don't get...

20:15.400 --> 20:16.800
No- our covers are
on that microchip.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.700
If we don't get it,
all of us get killed.

20:22.800 --> 20:23.600
Sarah!

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Bartowski and the CIA-
how could it not go wrong?

20:36.000 --> 20:36.900
You gotta believe me!
You gotta believe me!

20:36.900 --> 20:38.400
The whole creepy elfin thing

20:38.400 --> 20:39.500
was a compliment, I swear!

20:39.500 --> 20:40.800
Ever since my 6th grade

20:40.800 --> 20:42.800
<i>librarian introduced
me to TheHobbit,</i>

20:42.800 --> 20:44.600
I been hooked on 'em.
I don't know if it's the eyes

20:44.600 --> 20:45.900
- or the ears...
- Shut up, Jorge!

20:45.900 --> 20:47.500
Chuck, duck and cover!

20:50.900 --> 20:51.800
Go!

20:59.100 --> 20:59.900
Go!

21:01.800 --> 21:02.700
Chuck!

21:02.700 --> 21:03.700
You okay?

21:03.700 --> 21:04.900
- Chuck. Hey.
- I'm, uh...

21:04.900 --> 21:06.900
I... yeah, yeah.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.700
Yeah. Yeah.

21:09.700 --> 21:10.700
Run!

21:22.300 --> 21:24.400
Oh, my...

21:35.200 --> 21:36.100
Hi.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.000
Hey.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.400
I, uh, brought you
some gardenias.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.100
They're my favorite.
How did you know?

21:42.100 --> 21:45.000
Well, I'm not an entirely
incompetent spy, you know?

21:45.300 --> 21:46.000
Thank you.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.200
And you can put them over there.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.000
Bryce Larkin, huh?

21:54.100 --> 21:55.000
I guess, no matter
what it is,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
I'll always come
in second to that guy.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.100
Not always.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.900
Ellie said you
had a concussion?

22:06.000 --> 22:08.800
Oh, it's just a minor
concussion, I'm fine.

22:09.300 --> 22:11.600
It's my ego that's hurt
more than anything.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.200
I don't believe it.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.400
What's up, babe?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.800
That is
Sarah's ex.

22:19.700 --> 22:21.300
That guy just
won't back off.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.300
You know what, Chuck
might be too nice

22:22.300 --> 22:23.900
to say anything,
but I am not.

22:23.900 --> 22:25.400
Whoa, whoa, hold on, babe.

22:25.900 --> 22:27.100
Let me handle this.

22:27.400 --> 22:28.800
I'm sorry- it's my fault.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.900
If I didn't get fired,
this never would've happened.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.600
Hey, don't apologize, okay?

22:32.600 --> 22:34.800
It is not your job
to protect me.

22:35.000 --> 22:35.800
Well...

22:36.200 --> 22:38.500
all things being considered,
that's probably a good thing.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.300
Yeah, you have a lot
of good qualities,

22:41.300 --> 22:44.900
but, uh, I'm not sure
"bodyguard" is one of them.

22:45.700 --> 22:46.500
Hey, bro!

22:47.200 --> 22:48.900
- Hey.
- Whoa!

22:48.900 --> 22:50.500
That cut
looks infected.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.200
Yeah, I better take a look
at that- come on.

22:54.300 --> 22:55.200
Sorry, bro,
but you got

22:55.200 --> 22:56.400
a lot of dirt in there.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.100
Ow.

22:59.000 --> 22:59.700
So...

22:59.700 --> 23:00.800
how do you know Sarah?

23:01.200 --> 23:02.400
She's my ex.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.200
Based on all the
flowers you sent,

23:05.200 --> 23:07.100
I'd say you still had
feelings for her.

23:08.100 --> 23:09.100
It's complicated.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.300
I know.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.900
She's dating my soon-to-be
brother-in-law, Chuck.

23:14.700 --> 23:15.600
I didn't know.

23:15.900 --> 23:17.200
Sarah said she wanted
to tell me something,

23:17.200 --> 23:18.400
but then she got hurt.

23:19.400 --> 23:20.500
Ouch.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.900
Cut's pretty
deep there.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.500
So, um, Chuck and Sarah...

23:25.400 --> 23:26.300
is it serious?

23:27.900 --> 23:30.400
I'm specializing in
cardiothoracic medicine.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.400
That means there's one thing
in the world I know best:

23:33.900 --> 23:34.900
the human heart.

23:35.600 --> 23:36.400
I've spent enough
time with them

23:36.400 --> 23:37.800
to see how they
are together,

23:38.000 --> 23:39.200
see how she
looks at him.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.600
My professional opinion?

23:41.900 --> 23:43.300
She's in love with Chuck, dude.

23:49.700 --> 23:51.600
You look terrible.

23:52.100 --> 23:54.400
Did you guys actually sleep
at the Buy More last night,

23:54.400 --> 23:56.200
- so you could avoid Mitt?
- What? No.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.400
- Of course not. 
- Please, I'm not afraid of that miscreant.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.500
And if he were here,
we'd tell him.

24:04.800 --> 24:05.600
Jeff, put
that away.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.300
<i>No way! This is
like Faces of Death</i>

24:07.300 --> 24:09.500
all over again-
I'm gonna make a fortune.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.400
No, no.
You want to do this?

24:12.600 --> 24:13.300
Let's do this.

24:13.300 --> 24:15.500
- Let's do this.
- Yes.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.300
You guys didn't
show up last night.

24:26.200 --> 24:28.500
I felt like a girl that
got stood up on prom night.

24:29.100 --> 24:30.600
What's wrong?
Don't you want to dance

24:30.600 --> 24:32.400
with me, bearded little man?

24:32.400 --> 24:33.100
Um...

24:34.600 --> 24:35.300
Hey, do you think that maybe

24:35.300 --> 24:36.300
we could work this
out together?

24:36.300 --> 24:37.800
You know, man to man
kind of thing?

24:40.600 --> 24:42.700
???

24:43.500 --> 24:44.100
We?

24:44.100 --> 24:45.200
We.

24:46.300 --> 24:48.700
All right, uh, you know, I...
yes, I'll just have

24:48.700 --> 24:51.500
to take two weeks'
advance pay, but yeah, fine.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.100
Okay, you got a deal.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.000
That's right!

24:57.400 --> 24:58.800
And don't ever
come back!

24:59.200 --> 25:01.000
Wow, how'd
you do that?

25:01.600 --> 25:03.600
You just gotta learn
to speak their language.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.800
You bully a bully.

25:05.900 --> 25:06.800
Yeah.

25:11.500 --> 25:12.300
Chuck.

25:12.300 --> 25:13.200
You... wow.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.200
You really ought
to think

25:14.200 --> 25:16.200
about toning down
the entrances a notch.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.900
Sorry, comes
with the job.

25:19.300 --> 25:21.000
Uh, look, I've...
I've already

25:21.000 --> 25:23.800
had a pretty long day,
and I gotta get to work,

25:23.800 --> 25:25.700
so if you have
any life-changing bombs

25:25.700 --> 25:26.700
that you'd like
to drop on me,

25:26.700 --> 25:28.200
could you please
save them for later?

25:28.500 --> 25:30.000
I'm worried
about Sarah.

25:30.100 --> 25:31.100
There's nothing
to be worried about.

25:31.100 --> 25:32.100
She got a
minor concussion

25:32.100 --> 25:33.500
and a few bruises-
she'll be fine.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.000
No, that's not what
I'm worried about.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.600
She went off mission.

25:36.600 --> 25:37.600
And not only
did we lose

25:37.600 --> 25:38.900
the microchip and
the FULCRUM agent,

25:38.900 --> 25:40.200
the two of you
almost got killed.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.900
Okay, she went off mission
to protect me,

25:41.900 --> 25:45.000
which by the way, is her job
and wins her points in my book.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.100
<i>Sarah has feelings
for you, Chuck.</i>

25:49.000 --> 25:50.600
Feelings that will
get her killed.

25:51.700 --> 25:52.700
People we deal with

25:52.700 --> 25:53.800
are cold-blooded assassins.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.100
They have no emotions,

25:55.100 --> 25:56.200
no feelings.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.100
The only chance we have
against FULCRUM

25:58.100 --> 25:59.400
is to think and act
like they do.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.100
Anything less gets us killed.

26:02.100 --> 26:03.800
Sarah knows
what she's doing, Bryce.

26:16.700 --> 26:17.500
Sarah Walker's room.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.800
Oh, room 808.

26:31.000 --> 26:31.900
Chuck.

26:33.100 --> 26:34.700
Just the guy I
was looking for.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
These are for you.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.600
Wow, Devon.

26:38.100 --> 26:40.000
Thanks, I've never
received flowers

26:40.000 --> 26:42.200
from another man
before, but I suppose

26:42.200 --> 26:43.500
there's a first time
for everything.

26:43.500 --> 26:44.500
They're not from me, Chuck.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.400
That's a relief.

26:45.700 --> 26:47.300
They're from Sarah's ex.

26:47.900 --> 26:48.900
I intercepted them

26:48.900 --> 26:50.000
before they got to her room.

26:50.300 --> 26:51.900
This guy won't take no
for an answer

26:51.900 --> 26:52.800
Indeed.

26:53.900 --> 26:54.800
Thanks for looking out.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.200
Hey, that's what bros are for.

26:57.100 --> 26:58.200
Right.

27:04.800 --> 27:05.700
Bryce.

27:08.800 --> 27:09.600
Hello?

27:09.600 --> 27:10.400
Yeah, you know what, Bryce,

27:10.400 --> 27:12.200
I almost bought
your little speech, but...

27:12.200 --> 27:13.400
Who's Bryce?

27:14.400 --> 27:16.900
Von Hayes... Von Hayes,
we've been looking for you.

27:16.900 --> 27:18.000
Who is this?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.400
Chor... Jorge.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.500
Jorge Carmichael.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.200
Uh, who?

27:21.200 --> 27:22.900
The waiter, the
waiter who, uh,

27:22.900 --> 27:24.600
who dropped that bottle
of Lafite Rothschild.

27:24.600 --> 27:25.900
How did you get my number?

27:26.000 --> 27:28.700
I- I sent the flowers
to that female agent.

27:28.700 --> 27:31.100
Yeah, yeah, well, uh, you know,

27:31.100 --> 27:32.300
I'm her supervisor,

27:32.300 --> 27:34.400
and your little case has made
its way up the food chain,

27:34.400 --> 27:36.000
so you're gonna be
dealing with me now.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.800
If you want to stay alive,

27:36.800 --> 27:39.100
you need to tell me
where that microchip is.

27:39.100 --> 27:39.900
Don't worry.

27:39.900 --> 27:41.700
I have it, it's safe, just...

27:41.700 --> 27:44.200
Just don't let those people
catch me, okay?

27:44.200 --> 27:46.000
Just get me the hell
out of here, Jorge.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
I'm-I'm-I'm living
in a Lamborghini.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.600
You-you can't imagine
how little legroom there is.

27:55.100 --> 27:56.200
All right, I know
you're pissed off

27:56.200 --> 27:57.400
that I screwed up
your perfect plans,

27:57.400 --> 27:59.200
but I have some good news.

27:59.700 --> 28:00.800
I found the microchip.

28:00.900 --> 28:02.200
How?
Doesn't matter how.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.800
The point is I did it.

28:04.300 --> 28:06.300
What exactly did you do,
Bartowski?

28:06.300 --> 28:09.400
I negotiated the return
of said microchip.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.700
Of course, I did have to agree
to certain terms.

28:12.000 --> 28:12.800
What terms?

28:12.800 --> 28:15.000
Well, one,he'll only make the exchange
with me.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.200
Uh, two, he wants full immunity

28:17.200 --> 28:19.000
from any government prosecution.

28:19.600 --> 28:20.400
I can live with that.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.100
There's one...
there... well, just...

28:22.400 --> 28:23.800
Sorry, there is
kind of just

28:23.800 --> 28:25.800
one more little
bitty thing.

28:26.300 --> 28:27.500
What? We're gonna need roughly

28:27.500 --> 28:29.600
$4.5 million in unmarked bills,

28:29.600 --> 28:31.200
preferably small denominations.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.200
Oh, how am I doing?

28:40.200 --> 28:41.100
Great.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.400
Looks like we'll release
you in a few hours.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.700
Oh, great.

28:47.800 --> 28:48.900
Don't worry.

28:50.100 --> 28:51.100
This won't
hurt a bit.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.400
Well, unfortunately,

28:54.400 --> 28:56.500
I can't promise the same.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.300
What?

29:04.200 --> 29:05.200
I don't like FULCRUM,

29:05.200 --> 29:07.200
so I'm only gonna ask once.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.500
Where's your boss?

29:27.400 --> 29:28.400
Okay, here he is, Chuck.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.200
You're on.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Have you got the cash?

29:53.400 --> 29:54.300
Yeah, I have...

29:54.300 --> 29:56.300
I have... it's in...
it's right here in the bag.

29:57.300 --> 29:58.500
Do you have the microchip?

30:00.800 --> 30:02.500
All right, give me the cash. You first.

30:02.500 --> 30:05.200
No, you first. I'm pretty
positive you go first.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.900
Just make the exchange, moron.

30:06.900 --> 30:08.200
I've never done a
handoff before.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.100
I'm really not used
to this spy stuff.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.200
It's a little stressful,
isn't it?

30:11.200 --> 30:12.200
Yeah.
Yeah.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.800
Okay, I got an idea. Oh, yeah?

30:13.800 --> 30:14.800
????

30:14.800 --> 30:16.500
I'm gonna count to three.
You're gonna count to three?

30:16.500 --> 30:18.300
Or if you want... to count to three?
No, no, it's too much pressure.

30:18.300 --> 30:20.100
You count to three, I'll...
So, I'm gonna count to three.

30:20.100 --> 30:22.100
On three or after
three? What do you want?

30:22.100 --> 30:23.000
We'll do after three,

30:23.000 --> 30:24.200
so it's like one,
two, three, change.

30:24.200 --> 30:25.400
Okay, here we go: one...

30:26.900 --> 30:27.900
two...

30:29.400 --> 30:31.100
Trouble, Chuck.
Make the exchange.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.700
You told me I
could trust you.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.100
No. No, no, no, wait!

30:38.300 --> 30:39.200
Wait! No!

30:39.700 --> 30:41.300
I can never get a break.

30:42.400 --> 30:43.700
You stay here this time.

30:43.700 --> 30:44.300
Hey...

30:45.400 --> 30:46.700
Don't you need this?

30:56.500 --> 30:58.000
Give us the chip, Mr. Hayes.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.800
Don't move! Drop your weapons!

31:06.400 --> 31:07.800
Sorry, fellas.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.500
Someone's paid us
a lot of money

31:09.500 --> 31:10.900
to take that chip.

31:14.700 --> 31:16.300
Hold on. Wait!
Don't do anything.

31:16.300 --> 31:17.400
No shooting.

31:20.300 --> 31:21.400
Excuse me, gentlemen.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.600
May I have your attention,
please?

31:27.300 --> 31:28.100
Um...

31:29.100 --> 31:30.000
In my hands...

31:30.500 --> 31:33.900
...I'm holding $4.5 million
in unmarked bills.

31:33.900 --> 31:35.900
Now, I'm not sure
what the current

31:36.400 --> 31:39.100
going rate
for thug-for-hire work is,

31:39.400 --> 31:41.200
but I'm feeling
pretty confident

31:41.800 --> 31:43.500
that it's a lot less
than this.

31:45.300 --> 31:47.200
Now, all I ask is
that you let

31:47.300 --> 31:49.700
Von Hayes
and my two friends here go,

31:50.000 --> 31:51.500
and the money's
all yours.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.500
Or you can

31:53.500 --> 31:56.100
die horrible deaths
in a hail of gunfire.

31:56.700 --> 31:58.000
The choice is yours, really.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.700
That was amazing!

32:18.700 --> 32:20.400
Thank you, Jorge.
No, don't mention it.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.200
All right.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.300
No, no, no-
don't encourage him.

32:23.300 --> 32:24.800
You know, a little appreciation
wouldn't kill you.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.200
I mean, I did get the microchip back.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.400
You also gave away $4.5 million

32:28.400 --> 32:30.800
in taxpayer money.
Nobody's perfect.

32:31.400 --> 32:32.400
Where are you going?

32:32.400 --> 32:33.800
To get it back, idiot.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.400
You know, I don't need Casey
to tell me I'm a good spy.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.600
I think I'm doing fine.
The fact of the matter is

32:40.600 --> 32:42.700
I mean, it's really not as hard
as it's cracked up to be anyway.

32:42.700 --> 32:44.800
Okay, let's
try this one more time.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.200
The microchip.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.400
The microchip, now.
Release the kid first.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.700
"Kid"? Honestly, we're born
in the same year.

32:55.700 --> 32:57.600
Give me the chip
and I'll let him go.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.800
Promise.

33:10.500 --> 33:11.600
Chip?

33:18.700 --> 33:21.100
There. Now release him.

33:23.900 --> 33:24.700
Sorry.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.100
Got it?

33:38.100 --> 33:39.500
Yeah, I got it.

33:42.800 --> 33:43.600
Take it.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.200
Take the shot, Sarah!

33:47.800 --> 33:49.700
Sarah, take the shot!

33:50.300 --> 33:51.200
Take it!

33:56.600 --> 33:57.500
Oh!

33:59.600 --> 34:01.000
Well, you want
something done right...

34:01.700 --> 34:03.000
you do it yourself.

34:22.300 --> 34:24.300
Morgan, you said you
got rid of them.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.000
End him, Morgan.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.600
My friend, please.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.900
Please fix this.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.699
Man, get off!
Come on! Get him! Get him!

34:32.699 --> 34:34.199
You're gonna buy me...

34:35.800 --> 34:36.900
Uh, Mr. Mitt, sir.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.100
Hey, uh, we had
an understanding before.

34:39.100 --> 34:40.900
We did, before.

34:41.400 --> 34:43.300
Now we need a PlayStation 3.

34:43.300 --> 34:44.300
I'm broke, man.

34:44.300 --> 34:45.699
Well, if that's the case,

34:46.000 --> 34:47.300
scram, you little loser.

34:47.300 --> 34:49.000
You can't talk to him like that.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.500
Piss off, Yoko.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.199
You can't talk to me like that.

34:52.199 --> 34:53.300
Right, Morgan?

34:54.600 --> 34:55.800
I don't hear anything.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.600
You guys hear anything?

35:04.500 --> 35:07.000
Oh, did you hear that?

35:22.200 --> 35:23.400
Sweep the leg, Morgan.

35:23.400 --> 35:24.600
Sweep the leg.

35:25.100 --> 35:26.200
Just so you know,

35:26.800 --> 35:30.500
I think my fist is bigger
than your entire head.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.700
Lay off him, meatheads.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.800
Anna, what are you doing?

35:35.800 --> 35:37.000
Saving you, babe.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.700
Um... I don't really
think that that's...

35:40.700 --> 35:42.400
Hey, I don't fight girls.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.500
Neither do I.

35:53.300 --> 35:54.100
Oh!

35:57.700 --> 36:00.100
Can I get a background clearance
on a one Anna Wu?

36:06.000 --> 36:07.400
Nice shot, Miss Wu.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.400
I have a candidate
for possible field work.

36:11.900 --> 36:12.700
No.

36:21.500 --> 36:22.200
Chuck.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.800
What did I say
about the entrances?

36:24.800 --> 36:26.500
We need to talk
about Sarah.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.200
She had a chance
to take the shot

36:28.200 --> 36:29.700
back there
and she didn't.

36:30.100 --> 36:32.000
She hesitated
and almost cost us

36:32.000 --> 36:33.800
the microchip and your life.

36:35.900 --> 36:36.700
I know.

36:38.300 --> 36:39.500
What are you
going to do about it?

36:44.500 --> 36:45.300
I don't know, Bryce.

36:45.300 --> 36:47.200
You tell me.
What am I supposed to do?

36:47.200 --> 36:48.500
You'll do the right thing.

36:49.300 --> 36:50.300
You always do.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.100
That why I sent you
the Intersect in the first place.

36:57.500 --> 36:58.700
Hey, uh, Bryce...

37:00.400 --> 37:01.500
Forgot your glasses.

37:02.100 --> 37:03.000
You keep 'em.

37:03.600 --> 37:04.600
If you're going to be
a real spy,

37:04.600 --> 37:05.700
you're gonna need them.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.600
I don't...
I don't want to be a real spy.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.500
From what I've seen, it's a little too late
for that, Chuck.

37:17.100 --> 37:19.200
I'm sure you
hate me right now.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.600
But someday you're gonna realize
I was looking out for you.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.300
I had been all along.

37:42.500 --> 37:43.800
I know I hesitated.

37:44.300 --> 37:47.100
I let my guard down momentarily
and it was a mistake.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.200
But I can protect Chuck.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.100
Hand me that chammy, will you?

38:18.300 --> 38:19.300
Hey.
Hey.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.300
Everything okay?

38:20.800 --> 38:22.400
Yeah, yeah.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.600
Just, there's, um...

38:24.500 --> 38:25.500
I just had a
couple of things

38:25.500 --> 38:27.300
I wanted to tell you
before dinner. Yeah.

38:27.300 --> 38:29.400
Me, too. Look...
Look...

38:29.500 --> 38:30.700
I'm sorry.

38:32.200 --> 38:32.900
Look, we
both know

38:32.900 --> 38:35.400
how I feel about you,
so I'm just gonna shoot

38:35.400 --> 38:36.400
straight.

38:37.900 --> 38:39.900
Sarah, you're the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

38:41.300 --> 38:42.700
You're beautiful,
you're smart,

38:42.700 --> 38:44.200
you laugh at all
of my stupid jokes,

38:44.200 --> 38:47.300
and you have this horrible habit
of constantly saving my life.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.500
The truth is, you're everything

38:50.500 --> 38:52.400
that I thought
I ever wanted and more.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.300
The last few days,
all I can think about

38:55.300 --> 38:56.700
is our future together,

38:56.700 --> 38:58.000
about what it's gonna be like

38:58.000 --> 38:59.700
once I finally get the Intersect
out of my head,

38:59.700 --> 39:01.800
how we'll finally
be together for real-

39:01.800 --> 39:04.800
no fake relationships...

39:04.800 --> 39:06.400
no covers, no lies.

39:10.500 --> 39:12.600
But the more I think about it,
the more I realize

39:13.400 --> 39:15.600
that you and I can never
have a future together.

39:18.500 --> 39:21.300
I fooled myself into thinking
that we could, but the truth is

39:21.700 --> 39:22.900
we can't.

39:24.300 --> 39:25.900
Because even if we had
a real relationship,

39:25.900 --> 39:27.400
it would never really be real.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.800
I'd still never know
anything about you-

39:31.600 --> 39:33.000
your real name,
your hometown,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
your first love,
anything.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.400
And I want more than that.

39:38.800 --> 39:41.000
I want to be able to call you
at the end of a bad day

39:41.000 --> 39:43.100
and tell you about some
funny thing that Morgan did

39:43.100 --> 39:45.300
and not find out that I can't
because you're off...

39:45.800 --> 39:47.000
somewhere in Paraguay,

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
quelling a revolution
with a fork.

39:51.300 --> 39:52.600
I'm a normal guy...

39:54.100 --> 39:55.800
who wants a normal life.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.500
And as amazing as you
are, Sarah Walker,

39:58.500 --> 39:59.700
we both know that...

40:01.700 --> 40:03.000
you will never be normal.

40:08.800 --> 40:12.400
You know, someday, when the
Intersect is out of your head

40:12.400 --> 40:15.100
and you have the life
that you always wanted,

40:15.100 --> 40:16.800
you'll forget all about me.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.200
I seriously doubt that.

40:25.700 --> 40:26.800
Come on, we better get inside.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.100
They're waiting for us.

40:55.700 --> 40:56.800
Hey.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.300
It's our favorite bridesmaid.

40:58.300 --> 40:59.400
I'm so excited!

40:59.500 --> 41:01.300
Wait till you see
the dresses that I picked out.

41:02.200 --> 41:03.000
Hey, buddy.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Glad to see you guys
worked things out.

41:05.300 --> 41:07.300
Who knows,
maybe you're next, huh?

41:52.800 --> 41:54.000
Not bad.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.100
Carmichael.

41:57.900 --> 41:59.900
Charles Carmichael.

42:29.200 --> 42:31.200
I hate Bryce Larkin.
