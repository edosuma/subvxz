<i>Previousy on Switched at Birth...</i>

00:01.890 --> 00:03.022
Our girls are home!

00:03.058 --> 00:05.825
I'm gonna take a couple
of pre-med classes

00:05.861 --> 00:08.892
My plan is to find a place to live.

00:08.895 --> 00:10.690
What about the apartment
above the Cracked Mug,

00:10.725 --> 00:11.791
isn't that empty?

00:11.826 --> 00:14.640
- You're mad.
- _

00:14.648 --> 00:16.930
Nothing is gonna change between us.

00:16.964 --> 00:19.633
You're... breaking up with me.

00:19.667 --> 00:21.635
- My daughters are back
- I knew it.

00:21.669 --> 00:23.270
Please don't make this
harder than it has to be.

00:23.304 --> 00:25.972
I'm just making a buck
off girls' stupidity.

00:26.007 --> 00:28.742
You are an arrogant,
sexist, bottom-feeding thief.

00:28.776 --> 00:32.086
- Rumor has it that you are the new RA.
- It's true.

00:32.180 --> 00:33.414
Oh, hey, we're having a party tonight.

00:33.448 --> 00:35.249
Come dressed as your favorite singer.

00:35.283 --> 00:36.717
Young money, baby!

00:36.751 --> 00:38.285
Oh, my God!

00:38.319 --> 00:40.587
That's totally insulting,
you know that, right?

00:40.622 --> 00:41.689
You don't like Lil Wayne?

00:41.723 --> 00:43.190
Whatever. I'll see you later.

00:58.968 --> 01:00.034
Good morning.

01:02.304 --> 01:05.473
I had no idea that being "just friends"

01:05.507 --> 01:07.976
was gonna be so uncomfortable.

01:08.010 --> 01:10.378
Hey, I offered to take the floor,

01:10.412 --> 01:13.281
but you insisted that
Lil Wayne was a gentleman.

01:13.315 --> 01:16.317
Truer words have never been spoken.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.558
(cell phone beeps)

01:26.235 --> 01:27.435
What?

01:28.971 --> 01:30.038
What's wrong?

01:31.574 --> 01:33.475
A picture of us from
the party last night.

01:33.509 --> 01:35.543
Someone posted it on Chat Bandit.

01:35.578 --> 01:36.911
Seriously? Why?

01:36.946 --> 01:40.148
To tell me what a racist ass I am,

01:40.182 --> 01:41.816
- apparently.
- What?

01:44.020 --> 01:45.787
Mine's blowing up, too.

01:48.164 --> 01:50.999
This is the photo I posted on Instagram.

01:51.034 --> 01:54.570
I dressed up as Lil Wayne. You'd
think I went as a KKK member.

01:54.604 --> 01:57.139
"Just another brainless white girl,

01:57.173 --> 01:59.007
coasting on her white privilege."

01:59.042 --> 02:00.676
What?

02:00.710 --> 02:02.077
Oh my God...

02:03.746 --> 02:05.781
Ouch.

02:12.222 --> 02:14.423
People hate us.

John: My pitcher's
injured, I need someone

02:23.467 --> 02:24.967
to replace him immediately.

02:25.002 --> 02:26.969
What about Travis?
You have him back now.

02:27.004 --> 02:28.571
Yeah, but he needs some
serious conditioning.

02:28.605 --> 02:30.339
He wasn't playing in
China. He was coaching.

02:30.374 --> 02:32.041
Well, what's your Plan "B" then, John?

02:32.075 --> 02:35.011
I found this kid pitching for Michigan.

02:35.045 --> 02:37.613
He apparently has some family issues,

02:37.648 --> 02:39.415
needs to transfer closer to home.

02:39.449 --> 02:41.350
And home is Kansas City?

02:41.385 --> 02:43.252
- Yes.
- That's great.

02:43.286 --> 02:44.687
I'll get right on it. What's his name?

02:44.721 --> 02:45.721
Chris Walker.

02:45.756 --> 02:48.391
90-mile-an-hour fastball, killer slider,

02:48.425 --> 02:49.759
and check this out...

02:49.793 --> 02:51.661
he's batting .325.

02:51.695 --> 02:54.130
I love it. We will travel him down here.

02:54.164 --> 02:55.531
No need to. He's already here.

02:55.565 --> 02:57.066
- Really?
- Talking to other schools.

02:57.100 --> 02:58.501
We'll have him over for dinner.

02:58.535 --> 03:00.036
Once he gets a peek
at your Royals stuff,

03:00.070 --> 03:01.837
it'll knock his socks off.

03:03.073 --> 03:05.307
- Hey.
- Well, hello.

03:05.342 --> 03:07.510
I thought you and Daphne had moved out.

03:07.544 --> 03:08.711
Yes, we did,

03:08.745 --> 03:10.780
but there's a significant
lack of groceries at our pad.

03:10.814 --> 03:12.615
You do know where to obtain groceries

03:12.649 --> 03:14.316
out there in the real world?

03:14.351 --> 03:16.552
Hmm, yeah, but I wanted to see you guys!

03:16.586 --> 03:18.254
Ohhh, there's some
lasagna in the fridge.

03:18.288 --> 03:19.689
Thank you!

03:19.723 --> 03:21.357
I... will grab it for Daphne.

03:21.396 --> 03:22.762
I'm having dinner with Travis tonight.

03:22.764 --> 03:24.731
Dinners out, apartments...

03:24.766 --> 03:25.765
sounds like all you're missing is...

03:25.817 --> 03:28.401
A job? I will have one, very soon.

03:28.436 --> 03:29.769
As a tattoo artist.

03:29.771 --> 03:32.355
There is this studio in town,

03:32.407 --> 03:35.692
it's run by this amazing
woman named Noelle.

03:35.744 --> 03:37.694
She is truly an original artist.

03:37.746 --> 03:40.697
She did a full triptych
on Tove Lo's back,

03:40.749 --> 03:42.749
and it landed her the
cover of Rolling Stone.

03:42.784 --> 03:45.368
People come from all
over just for her designs.

03:45.420 --> 03:46.786
So you have an interview with her.

03:46.788 --> 03:50.373
Not exactly, but, I did
this for months in Beijing.

03:50.425 --> 03:51.708
I've got a killer portfolio,

03:51.760 --> 03:52.709
and what I know is,

03:52.761 --> 03:54.427
in order to be doing cutting edge work,

03:54.462 --> 03:55.762
you've gotta be at a great studio.

03:55.877 --> 03:56.876
So no worries.

03:56.878 --> 03:57.877
I got this job in the bag.

03:57.929 --> 03:59.879
- Sounds good.
- Thanks, 'rents!

04:05.437 --> 04:06.719
Hey there, Bender.

04:06.771 --> 04:07.770
Huh?

04:07.806 --> 04:10.723
Bender. Judd Nelson?

04:10.775 --> 04:11.774
Breakfast Club.

04:12.894 --> 04:14.394
God, you're young.

04:16.781 --> 04:19.732
I knew the age thing was
the reason you ended this.

04:19.784 --> 04:21.784
I told you, my daughters are home,

04:21.820 --> 04:23.403
I need to focus on family, that's all.

04:24.873 --> 04:26.739
Okay...

04:26.741 --> 04:28.408
so if age isn't the hangup,

04:28.410 --> 04:29.826
let's talk numbers.

04:29.878 --> 04:31.411
You don't have to say it out loud,

04:31.413 --> 04:32.412
I'll just start counting,

04:32.464 --> 04:33.746
and you could blink

04:33.748 --> 04:34.831
when I get to the right number.

04:34.883 --> 04:35.882
35.

04:35.917 --> 04:37.750
36.

04:37.752 --> 04:38.801
37.

04:38.837 --> 04:40.803
38.

04:40.839 --> 04:41.804
39?

04:43.842 --> 04:45.758
40.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.760
Oh, good for me.

04:47.812 --> 04:49.429
You Regina and Luca?

04:49.481 --> 04:50.480
Yeah.

04:50.515 --> 04:52.432
Great. The mom and the jarhead.

04:52.484 --> 04:53.900
- Excuse me?
- What did you say?

04:53.935 --> 04:56.819
Professor Evers put us together
for the group challenge.

04:56.855 --> 04:58.771
I assumed you guys already saw the list.

04:58.773 --> 04:59.856
Of course.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.824
I was just telling Luca,

05:01.860 --> 05:04.410
that I own a cafe in East Riverside,

05:04.446 --> 05:07.363
and we can use that for the project.

05:07.415 --> 05:09.699
Fine. I'll go let Evers know.

05:11.753 --> 05:13.386
(whispers) How did that happen?

05:13.438 --> 05:15.738
(whispers) Maybe the professor
thinks we're a good fit.

05:18.870 --> 05:20.787
I just... I don't get
it, when did dressing up

05:20.839 --> 05:22.755
like a hip hop artist
become a racist thing?

05:22.791 --> 05:24.807
Right? And who made up that rule?

05:24.859 --> 05:27.660
You can only dress like
a celebrity you love

05:27.712 --> 05:29.595
if they're the same ethnicity?

05:29.597 --> 05:31.564
And I love Lil Wayne!

05:31.599 --> 05:32.749
I wasn't trying to make fun of him.

05:32.784 --> 05:35.651
I have a Chinese lotus tattoo

05:35.687 --> 05:36.719
on my neck, but I'm not Chinese.

05:36.755 --> 05:39.655
Is that appropriating Asian culture?

05:41.576 --> 05:43.626
You know what? It's Chat Bandit.

05:43.678 --> 05:45.611
By lunch, everyone's gonna be

05:45.647 --> 05:47.613
talking about some football player

05:47.649 --> 05:49.549
who's taking steroids.

05:49.584 --> 05:50.967
We just have to wait it out.

05:52.987 --> 05:55.538
I just don't get how it blew up so fast.

05:55.590 --> 05:56.873
There were a bunch of kids at the party,

05:56.925 --> 05:58.891
including a lot of black kids,

05:58.943 --> 06:00.793
and no one seemed to care last night.

06:01.830 --> 06:03.796
Actually, Iris was pretty upset.

06:04.899 --> 06:05.865
Right.

06:05.867 --> 06:07.767
Do you think we should talk with her?

06:07.802 --> 06:08.835
I'll do it.

06:08.837 --> 06:11.654
This will all blow over.

06:11.689 --> 06:12.789
It'll be fine.

Beijing for the last year.

06:47.976 --> 06:49.892
I brought my book if
you want to see my stuff.

06:52.714 --> 06:53.846
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hm.

Sorry. Not hiring.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.611
Hi. Excuse me. What time do
you think we'll be out of here?

07:08.646 --> 07:11.547
It takes how long it takes. You
made an appointment for two people,

07:11.583 --> 07:13.499
not half your sorority house.

07:13.551 --> 07:15.902
Sorry. When word got out,
our ranks kind of swelled.

07:15.904 --> 07:18.487
We just have a function
later we have to get to.

07:18.523 --> 07:20.423
So, make another appointment.

07:20.458 --> 07:21.490
This isn't a drive-through.

07:21.526 --> 07:23.426
We're taking our sorority
photo this evening,

07:23.461 --> 07:24.877
and we all really want
them in time for that.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.863
Is there any way you can do us all?

07:26.898 --> 07:28.865
- We'll pay extra.
- Let me help you out.

- It'll take you half the time.
- I don't even know you.

07:33.738 --> 07:35.738
Oh, trust me, I can
ink a wicked fire dragon

07:35.790 --> 07:37.073
with a seven-color fade.

07:37.108 --> 07:40.710
I promise you, I can lay up a
stencil of three Greek letters.

07:40.745 --> 07:42.595
Look, it's just a stencil.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.647
If you don't like my work,
you can always wash it off.

07:46.568 --> 07:48.501
- Stencil paper is in the third drawer down.
- (softly) Yes!

08:07.922 --> 08:09.889
Um, can I ask you a question?

08:09.891 --> 08:13.676
Did you post that photo of
me and Mingo on Chat Bandit?

08:13.796 --> 08:16.981
No, but I'm not surprised someone
did. It was really offensive.

08:17.016 --> 08:19.834
Iris, it was a costume party.

08:19.869 --> 08:20.885
Everyone was dressed up.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.887
Mingo was mocking black culture.

08:22.939 --> 08:25.706
He was dressed like Lil Wayne.

08:25.742 --> 08:26.874
That's not exactly black culture.

08:26.909 --> 08:29.760
So, you're the expert on black culture?

08:29.762 --> 08:30.895
Of course not.

08:30.947 --> 08:33.664
I just don't get why you're
acting like he wore blackface?

08:33.666 --> 08:34.765
He may as well have.

08:34.801 --> 08:37.668
He was running around
with a grill, Daphne.

08:37.703 --> 08:39.703
Because Lil Wayne wears a grill.

08:39.756 --> 08:42.606
Yeah, and it's a complete
racial stereotype,

08:42.642 --> 08:45.676
one that Mingo reinforced
for the entire dorm

08:45.712 --> 08:48.529
when he put on baggy pants and
threw up westside gang symbols.

08:48.564 --> 08:50.014
Is this even about last night?

08:50.016 --> 08:51.582
You've never liked Mingo.

08:51.617 --> 08:52.917
I'm clearly not the only one upset

08:52.969 --> 08:55.886
that he turned "ghetto
black person" into a costume

08:55.938 --> 08:57.872
for the dorm's entertainment.

08:57.907 --> 08:58.823
(sighs)

08:59.992 --> 09:01.892
I hate that we're fighting.

09:01.944 --> 09:02.893
I know.

09:02.945 --> 09:04.912
We need to catch up.

09:04.947 --> 09:06.881
Are you free for lunch?

09:06.916 --> 09:10.735
No, I'm meeting my friend
Adina, and a few other people.

09:10.737 --> 09:12.837
Nice. Is she part of your sorority?

09:13.890 --> 09:15.773
Black student union.

09:15.825 --> 09:17.691
Oh. I didn't know you
hung out with them.

09:17.744 --> 09:20.628
Well, a lot's happened
in the last 10 months.

09:20.663 --> 09:21.695
Like what?

09:23.616 --> 09:24.615
I gotta run.

09:24.667 --> 09:26.600
I'll see you later, okay?

09:34.932 --> 09:36.932
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:39.236 --> 09:40.318

09:41.955 --> 09:44.339
You know, let me kick you
down something for the effort.

09:44.341 --> 09:47.108
Uh, I appreciate that,

09:47.160 --> 09:49.294
but honestly, what I'm
really looking for is a job.

09:49.346 --> 09:51.096
I told you, I'm not hiring.

09:51.148 --> 09:53.148
But you could use the help.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.116
I mean, think how much
your business would grow.

09:55.168 --> 09:57.152
I like my studio the way it is.

09:57.187 --> 10:00.155
But clearly you have some experience.

10:00.207 --> 10:01.289
There are other studios in town.

10:01.291 --> 10:05.160
Yeah, places where I'll
spend all day inking Popeyes

10:05.195 --> 10:06.995
or zodiac tramp stamps.

10:07.030 --> 10:08.930
But your designs are incredible.

10:08.932 --> 10:10.365
And I want to be working with the best.

10:12.002 --> 10:13.051
Maybe I could use some help.

10:13.086 --> 10:16.338
Thank you! Oh, I will
kill it for you, I promise.

10:16.373 --> 10:17.372
No, no, no, that's not what I mean.

10:17.407 --> 10:19.324
What I'm offering you
is an apprentice job...

10:19.359 --> 10:21.359
phones, cleaning, helping
with supplies. That's it.

10:23.330 --> 10:26.231
Or there's always the
zodiac tramp stamps.

10:26.266 --> 10:28.316
♪ I can't get enough ♪

10:28.352 --> 10:31.169
♪ I can't get enough of it ♪

10:43.183 --> 10:46.067
Hey! I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

10:46.069 --> 10:49.004
but I have a good reason for being late.

10:50.057 --> 10:51.940
I got a job!

10:54.141 --> 10:55.690
_

10:58.348 --> 10:59.914
Come on, we can rally.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.916
Uh, YJ's is open late, let's go?

11:01.952 --> 11:04.936
It'll be just like our midnight
noodle runs back in Beijing.

11:04.937 --> 11:07.300
_

11:08.258 --> 11:09.891
Uh, well...

11:09.926 --> 11:11.242
I'll wait. We can go later.

11:11.243 --> 11:15.246
_

11:15.247 --> 11:18.100
_

11:18.101 --> 11:21.321
_

11:21.338 --> 11:23.088
I'll talk to him.

11:23.089 --> 11:24.410
_

11:25.911 --> 11:27.990
_

11:30.063 --> 11:32.047
Look, I'll make it up to you.

11:32.082 --> 11:33.048
Okay? I promise.

11:33.649 --> 11:35.300
_

11:37.301 --> 11:39.700
_

11:39.990 --> 11:40.889
Thanks.

11:42.025 --> 11:45.910
It's not exactly a tattoo artist job.

11:45.962 --> 11:48.930
It's more like a tattoo apprentice.

11:49.431 --> 11:51.731
_

11:51.952 --> 11:55.186
It's a little harder
than I was expecting

11:55.238 --> 11:56.354
to get a chair out here.

11:56.406 --> 12:00.091
Apparently people want
references in English.

12:00.092 --> 12:05.120
_

12:05.121 --> 12:07.300
_

12:15.859 --> 12:17.609
Daphne.

12:17.661 --> 12:18.710
Hey, Sharee!

12:18.762 --> 12:20.796
How are you? How is everything?

12:20.848 --> 12:23.732
Bomb. I got a job in
the athletic department,

12:23.734 --> 12:25.700
and it looks like I'll make
the Dean's list this quarter.

12:25.752 --> 12:26.718
Awesome.

12:26.753 --> 12:28.603
But how about you, world traveler?

12:28.639 --> 12:30.038
How's being back from China?

12:31.625 --> 12:32.591
It's okay.

12:35.432 --> 12:38.917
I went to a party with my
ex-boyfriend last night.

12:38.952 --> 12:40.285
Oh, that. Yeah, I saw.

12:40.337 --> 12:41.336
You saw the picture?

12:41.388 --> 12:43.354
I think everyone on campus did.

12:43.390 --> 12:45.240
Were you offended?

12:45.292 --> 12:46.341
Not really.

12:46.376 --> 12:48.176
I get why people are upset,

12:48.211 --> 12:49.310
but I don't let stuff
like that get to me.

12:49.312 --> 12:52.080
I wish everyone felt that way.

12:52.115 --> 12:54.165
Some kid acting like a
fool is not worth my time.

12:54.201 --> 12:56.151
I gotta do something.

12:56.186 --> 12:58.119
I can't just sit around and watch people

12:58.171 --> 13:01.022
say these awful things
about me and Mingo

13:01.057 --> 13:02.056
as if they know us.

13:02.108 --> 13:06.010
Look, I'm not sweating
it, but some people are.

13:06.062 --> 13:08.363
Being a black kid at UMKC

13:08.365 --> 13:11.349
can be... complicated.

13:11.384 --> 13:14.402
As a friend, I'm telling you...

13:14.404 --> 13:17.338
the best thing you can do
is try to stay out of it.

13:25.215 --> 13:27.198
Bottom of the ninth, one out.

13:27.234 --> 13:29.250
Saberhagen throws a cutter,

13:29.252 --> 13:31.269
and the ball gets hit
into the hole at third.

13:31.321 --> 13:33.154
Routine ground ball, no problem.

13:33.156 --> 13:36.191
But the ball takes a bad hop
over the shortstop's glove.

13:36.226 --> 13:38.026
- No!
- And in that moment,

13:38.078 --> 13:42.013
I am thinking what every single
person in that stadium is thinking,

13:42.048 --> 13:43.114
"There goes our no-hitter."

13:43.149 --> 13:44.199
So what happened?

13:44.251 --> 13:47.018
So I dive to my left,
stab the ball in the hop,

13:47.053 --> 13:49.020
sitting on my ass in the dirt,

13:49.055 --> 13:51.923
turn the double play, game over, we win.

13:52.008 --> 13:53.341
- Wow.
- True story, I was there.

13:53.343 --> 13:55.076
(laughing)

13:55.111 --> 13:57.295
I don't think I bought myself a beer
for the entire rest of the season.

13:57.330 --> 13:58.930
That's unbelievable.

13:58.965 --> 14:02.217
You know what? I do believe I
have that game ball in my office.

14:02.252 --> 14:05.136
Signed by the entire '85 Royals team.

14:05.188 --> 14:07.155
Let me see if I can find it.

14:10.143 --> 14:12.227
Chris, thanks for sitting down with us.

14:12.262 --> 14:14.195
I can tell that John's
becoming a big fan.

14:14.247 --> 14:16.164
He seems really cool.

14:16.216 --> 14:18.588
I just... I just want to
make the right decision

14:18.589 --> 14:19.689
 with this move, you know?

14:20.203 --> 14:23.054
I'm really sorry to hear that
your aunt is not doing well.

14:24.991 --> 14:27.041
John tells me that she raised you?

14:27.043 --> 14:29.010
Yeah. Yeah, she did,

14:29.062 --> 14:30.912
me and my little brother both.

14:30.947 --> 14:33.932
Well, I want you to know

14:33.967 --> 14:36.367
that you have my promise that
I will do everything in my power

14:36.419 --> 14:38.920
to make sure you can be there for her.

14:38.955 --> 14:40.238
Whatever you need.

14:40.273 --> 14:43.207
I'm really glad to hear that.

14:43.260 --> 14:45.310
Because if I'm gonna
make this move to UMKC,

14:45.345 --> 14:47.278
you know, I'm gonna need some things.

14:47.330 --> 14:49.130
The main thing being a car.

14:51.268 --> 14:54.002
Uh, okay.

14:54.054 --> 14:55.053
That's understandable,

14:55.088 --> 14:58.039
but you do know that it
is not possible for us

14:58.091 --> 14:59.924
to buy you a car?

14:59.960 --> 15:02.860
It is in clear violation of NCAA rules.

15:03.947 --> 15:05.046
Really?

15:05.098 --> 15:07.982
You know, because the
school I visited yesterday

15:08.034 --> 15:09.300
is offering up a Mustang.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.320
I just gotta be able
to get back and forth,

15:12.355 --> 15:14.238
you know, on account of my auntie.

15:14.291 --> 15:18.242
Well, we will absolutely take
care of your transportation needs.

15:18.278 --> 15:22.180
I will make sure that you
have access to shuttles

15:22.215 --> 15:25.116
or volunteer drivers...
whatever you need.

15:25.151 --> 15:28.052
Yeah, I don't think
you get what I'm saying.

15:30.140 --> 15:31.072
I want a car.

15:39.182 --> 15:42.083
I put together some numbers
for you guys to look at.

15:42.118 --> 15:45.061
We have to raise the
Cracked Mug's daily revenue

15:45.062 --> 15:46.940
by 10% to pass the project.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.257
- This place does solid business.
- Mm-hmm.

15:49.309 --> 15:52.260
Did you lose your vision in Afghanistan?

15:52.262 --> 15:54.379
It's only 8:00 and this
place is like a graveyard.

15:54.414 --> 15:57.365
So we'll recruit fresh customers.

15:57.400 --> 16:01.252
We could do a UMKC night, hand
out door prizes, do reward cards.

16:01.304 --> 16:03.271
We have to up profits by 10%.

16:03.306 --> 16:06.290
Hosting a study session isn't gonna
bring in that kind of cash flow.

16:06.326 --> 16:08.176
I wish we were near a military base.

16:08.228 --> 16:11.079
I downed five espressos a
night when I was in active duty.

16:11.114 --> 16:13.147
So do gamers.

16:13.183 --> 16:15.149
That could work.

16:15.201 --> 16:17.185
We could do a video game night.

16:17.220 --> 16:20.905
Get some machines in here, charge
a small fee for a tournament.

16:20.940 --> 16:23.041
- I love that idea.
- I can get some people in the door,

16:23.076 --> 16:25.059
make sure we're drawing
in the right kind of crowd.

16:25.095 --> 16:26.994
Then I'll handle the
special event permit.

16:28.298 --> 16:29.981
Great. Let's do it.

16:32.969 --> 16:35.920
And these kids, they're
on... what is it?

16:35.955 --> 16:37.305
- Chat Bandit.
- Yes!

16:37.357 --> 16:40.324
Okay, they're exactly what's
wrong with this whole PC culture.

16:40.377 --> 16:41.409
Let me tell you something.

16:41.411 --> 16:44.228
The real world our there
is a lot more offensive

16:44.264 --> 16:47.331
than some kid dressed up
like... whoever that is.

16:47.367 --> 16:50.084
Excuse me, you go here?

16:50.136 --> 16:52.019
Sign our petition?

16:52.072 --> 16:54.122
- _
- Greg Shimingo is an RA in Hanes Dorm.

16:54.124 --> 16:56.007
Apparently, he's got a
long history of bigotry.

16:56.042 --> 16:57.008
What?

16:57.043 --> 16:58.092
That's not true.

16:58.094 --> 17:00.027
I lived there. I know him.

17:00.029 --> 17:02.029
Did you see what he
wore the other night?

17:02.031 --> 17:04.048
Yeah, and I don't see
what the problem is.

17:04.099 --> 17:05.883
It was a costume party.

17:05.919 --> 17:10.003
Well, with or without your help,
we're getting rid of this guy.

17:15.863 --> 17:17.863
"I spent the last eight months in Asia

17:17.864 --> 17:20.448
and I can tell you
from personal experience

17:20.450 --> 17:22.733
that the right to individual expression

17:22.769 --> 17:27.372
remains the most fundamental
part of who we are as Americans."

17:27.406 --> 17:30.642
Wow. It's bold.

17:31.862 --> 17:33.828
Last year during the whole Tank thing,

17:33.864 --> 17:36.765
I was the angry mass'

17:36.767 --> 17:39.534
favorite topic of
conversation on Chat Bandit.

17:39.586 --> 17:40.752
All I wanted to do

17:40.787 --> 17:45.573
was get facial reconstructive
surgery and change my name.

17:45.609 --> 17:48.593
Are you sure that you wanna
step into the spotlight?

17:48.629 --> 17:51.413
Yeah, I have to.

17:51.448 --> 17:53.865
I don't think that people
understand what they're asking for.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.551
If Mingo loses his RA job,

17:56.603 --> 17:59.487
we're basically giving
permission to administration

17:59.539 --> 18:00.755
to tell us how to dress.

18:00.807 --> 18:03.458
We're volunteering to lose
our right to free speech.

18:03.493 --> 18:05.377
Daphne Vasquez,

18:05.412 --> 18:07.779
future doctor, current journalist.

18:07.814 --> 18:09.481
I like it.

18:09.533 --> 18:13.668
I'm just glad the UMKC Sentinel
agreed to let me write an op-ed.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.804
The editor hinted that
if it was good enough,

18:15.856 --> 18:17.622
he would lead with it.

18:17.658 --> 18:19.708
Look at us! Beijing sisters,

18:19.760 --> 18:22.727
we are back, and we are
ready to take KC by storm.

18:25.502 --> 18:27.552
Kathryn, I cannot lose this kid.

18:27.604 --> 18:30.538
He is a sure-fire solution
to my pitching problems.

18:30.574 --> 18:32.591
Buying him a car? I mean, really, John?

18:32.643 --> 18:34.409
That was out of line.

18:34.444 --> 18:35.577
Oh, welcome to the modern world.

18:35.612 --> 18:37.462
Please. Honestly, I do not understand

18:37.497 --> 18:39.481
why these kids aren't
paid in the first place.

18:39.516 --> 18:42.751
They play for four years, they
make us millions of dollars,

18:42.803 --> 18:45.195
and most of them never
ever get to the pros.

18:45.322 --> 18:46.371
They get nothing.

18:46.423 --> 18:48.307
They get an education, John.

18:48.359 --> 18:50.242
Kathryn, please, I've
heard that a million times.

18:50.277 --> 18:52.928
Okay, I don't like it any more than
you do, but those are the rules.

18:52.930 --> 18:54.229
And unless you have a way around

18:54.281 --> 18:57.299
the National Collegiate Athletic
Association, we are stuck here.

18:57.334 --> 19:00.302
Do you remember... Richie Sutter?

19:00.304 --> 19:02.154
Pitcher for the Cards, yeah.

19:02.206 --> 19:04.172
Richie's got a couple
of car dealerships.

19:04.208 --> 19:06.024
- I thought I'd give him a call.
- John!

19:06.060 --> 19:09.127
He's a big UMKC fan.
He just wants to help.

19:09.163 --> 19:12.981
Richie is willing to
give Chris a loaner car.

19:12.983 --> 19:15.133
No money changes hands,
there is no paper trail.

19:15.169 --> 19:18.070
When Chris is done with school,
he gives the loaner car back.

19:18.105 --> 19:21.089
Chris gets to see his sick aunt,
we get our new star pitcher,

19:21.125 --> 19:23.942
and no one is the wiser.

19:23.994 --> 19:25.994
- That's really clever.
- Yeah.

19:25.996 --> 19:27.880
But it's still cheating. We can't do it.

19:27.932 --> 19:30.575
You heard that that kid said. We
wouldn't be the only ones doing this.

19:30.586 --> 19:34.538
Are you seriously gonna roll
out that argument with me?

19:34.540 --> 19:37.507
That's what you said when
we got into our tax trouble,

19:37.509 --> 19:38.692
and look where that got us.

19:38.727 --> 19:42.546
Kathryn, I am on the verge
here, okay? I can feel it.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.514
We're not gonna lie and
cheat like those other people.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.437
Tuesday, ah, yes.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.322
Noelle can see you then.

19:52.374 --> 19:54.257
All right, cool. Bye.

19:56.011 --> 19:56.994
Is Noelle around?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.946
Uh, she'll be back later this afternoon.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.080
Can I help you with anything?

20:00.115 --> 20:02.099
Yeah, I was looking
for a specific image,

20:02.134 --> 20:04.117
but I don't see anything
like it in this book.

20:04.153 --> 20:06.920
She can always draw
something up for you.

20:06.922 --> 20:08.906
- What were you thinking of?
- An owl.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.023
Aww, I love that.

20:10.075 --> 20:12.926
Well, you can always go traditional

20:12.928 --> 20:14.394
or maybe more cartoony.

20:14.430 --> 20:17.230
It totally just depends on
the vibe you're going for.

20:17.266 --> 20:19.182
Here, check this out.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.401
Now, it's not an owl,

20:21.403 --> 20:26.340
but it is a high-contrast
black and gray technique.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.292
An owl would look great done like this.

20:28.327 --> 20:30.294
Wait, is this your book?

20:30.329 --> 20:32.145
Uh, yeah.

20:32.181 --> 20:33.230
I want you to do my tattoo.

20:36.085 --> 20:40.120
You should really come back and
discuss all of this with Noelle, really.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.973
I've seen her work. I like yours better.

20:43.008 --> 20:44.358
Don't you want to do it?

20:44.410 --> 20:46.076
Well, yeah, but...

20:46.111 --> 20:47.044
Then?

20:49.098 --> 20:50.948
Let's do this.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.366
Okay, take a seat.

20:54.069 --> 20:57.304
Straight back. Thank you so much.

20:58.407 --> 20:59.373
What is that?

20:59.408 --> 21:01.341
Is there a problem?

21:01.377 --> 21:03.360
Yeah. It's not 1982.

21:03.395 --> 21:06.213
I think when we said video games,

21:06.265 --> 21:08.298
Aidan was probably thinking
Xbox or PlayStation.

21:08.425 --> 21:10.358
Oh, of course.

21:10.394 --> 21:13.211
I knew I'd get screwed when Evers
paired me with the old person.

21:13.247 --> 21:14.262
Watch it.

21:14.298 --> 21:17.199
You know what? Aidan's right.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.267
I messed up. Let me call the vendor.

21:19.303 --> 21:21.053
Maybe he can swap the machines out.

21:21.105 --> 21:23.238
No! No, keep the games.

21:23.273 --> 21:24.950
We'll bring in some '80s music.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.180
Do a throwback arcade
night. It'll be cool.

21:27.277 --> 21:30.112
Are you willing to bet your
grade on it? 'Cause I'm not.

21:30.114 --> 21:32.130
Fine. Let's do both.

21:32.182 --> 21:34.066
It'll be sort of an
old-school-meets-new-school vibe.

21:34.101 --> 21:37.369
Whatever. I'll call around
for some game consoles

21:37.421 --> 21:38.403
and try to save our asses.

21:40.524 --> 21:43.408
Don't listen to him. It's gonna be fine.

21:43.460 --> 21:44.476
Okay.

21:47.331 --> 21:50.298
That's absurd. The university has
no right to tell us what to wear.

21:50.334 --> 21:52.615
I mean, if we start by
censoring students' wardrobe,

21:52.616 --> 21:53.966
what's next? Burning books?

21:54.204 --> 21:55.237
We may as well live in Soviet Russia.

21:55.289 --> 21:57.339
So we're just supposed
to let some racist idiot

21:57.391 --> 22:00.108
keep his job in the dorm
with students of color

22:00.160 --> 22:02.144
because, what, he's got
the right to free speech?

22:02.179 --> 22:03.403
This is America.

22:03.404 --> 22:05.750
We can't infringe upon
someone's first amendment rights

22:06.150 --> 22:07.282
- whenever our feelings are hurt.
- Exactly.

22:07.334 --> 22:10.085
There are plenty of legal
limits to free speech in the US.

22:10.137 --> 22:11.153
You wanna know what's a crime?

22:11.188 --> 22:13.054
Shouting "fire" in a crowded theater,

22:13.090 --> 22:14.406
making rude suggestions to women,

22:14.458 --> 22:16.458
and threatening someone
using racial slurs.

22:16.460 --> 22:20.028
No, I wasn't talking about
sexual harassment or threats.

22:20.080 --> 22:24.449
Wait, you're Daphne Vasquez?

22:24.485 --> 22:26.368
Are you even Latina?

22:26.370 --> 22:28.470
I'm Puerto Rican. I grew
up in East Riverside.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.322
I know who you are now.

22:30.357 --> 22:33.375
Your dad's that Royals player.
That white Royals player.

22:33.377 --> 22:36.311
Uh, her skin color is
totally irrelevant, okay?

22:36.313 --> 22:38.330
We're talking about
free speech, not racism.

22:38.382 --> 22:41.183
- See, that's so easy for you to say.
- Don't be naive. This is so

22:41.218 --> 22:43.235
- clearly a racism issue.
- You think I don't understand discrimination?

22:43.270 --> 22:45.187
- I don't know?
- Are you kidding me?

22:45.222 --> 22:47.055
- Wait, wait, stop.
- You will never understand...

22:47.107 --> 22:49.107
And who gave you permission
to own the struggle anyway?

22:49.159 --> 22:51.209
- That's right!
- You sound so racist. How can you even say that?

22:51.261 --> 22:53.195
(all arguing)

22:53.230 --> 22:55.997
Okay, okay, enough!

22:56.049 --> 22:58.049
Everybody settle down.

22:58.101 --> 23:00.986
As fascinating as all this is,

23:01.021 --> 23:03.371
we've still got Kant
to wrestle with today.

23:19.156 --> 23:20.939
Hey.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.875
What are you doing here?

23:23.928 --> 23:26.044
Oh, I believe the phrase
is "hiding like a coward."

23:26.130 --> 23:27.896
Mingo.

23:27.948 --> 23:29.281
Everywhere I went today,

23:29.333 --> 23:32.851
people were just looking at me like
I was some kind of serial killer.

23:32.886 --> 23:34.937
They can't stay mad forever.

23:34.972 --> 23:36.788
It gets worse.

23:36.840 --> 23:40.192
I have to meet with the RA board
in an hour to fight for my job.

23:40.244 --> 23:41.910
This whole thing is just a nightmare.

23:41.946 --> 23:43.829
They can't fire you over this.

23:43.831 --> 23:44.880
Sure they can.

23:44.932 --> 23:47.232
According to Chat Bandit,
I'm the worst RA alive.

23:47.234 --> 23:49.768
If they fire you over a costume,

23:49.803 --> 23:53.205
the university is essentially
declaring that they can censor us.

23:53.240 --> 23:56.024
We have the right to offend people.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.026
That's what makes us Americans.

23:58.062 --> 24:00.112
If we let them tell us how to dress,

24:00.147 --> 24:02.080
what's next? What books we can read?

24:02.132 --> 24:04.049
What websites we can visit?

24:04.051 --> 24:06.985
Hey. Hey.

24:08.922 --> 24:10.856
You can do this.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.824
I know you can.

24:12.876 --> 24:13.959
Just talk to them.

24:15.929 --> 24:17.863
Yeah. You're right.

24:19.783 --> 24:21.717
I got this.

24:25.239 --> 24:27.205
But just in case, though,

24:27.241 --> 24:27.980
do you think you could...

24:27.981 --> 24:30.200
you could text me some of
that stuff you just said?

24:45.059 --> 24:46.925
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

24:46.927 --> 24:48.026
What's all this?

24:48.062 --> 24:50.045
Apparently it's what the
kids do for fun these days.

24:52.132 --> 24:53.965
You okay?

24:53.967 --> 24:55.967
That seemed pretty intense over there.

24:56.003 --> 24:58.854
- Did you read my article?
- Of course.

24:58.889 --> 25:02.708
(clears throat) And I heard a
lot of kids talk about it today.

25:02.760 --> 25:03.875
You made quite an impact.

25:03.927 --> 25:06.111
Yeah.

25:07.798 --> 25:09.848
Mexican hot chocolate coming right up.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.700
Talk to me.

25:11.735 --> 25:14.803
I thought I could use the
article to show everyone

25:14.838 --> 25:16.755
how crazy this whole thing is,

25:16.807 --> 25:19.741
but I feel like I
just made things worse.

25:21.161 --> 25:24.179
Well, Mingo made a
pretty clueless decision

25:24.231 --> 25:25.997
to dress up like that.

25:26.033 --> 25:27.082
You defended him.

25:27.134 --> 25:29.101
You think his outfit was racist?

25:29.136 --> 25:31.019
Of course.

25:31.071 --> 25:34.873
How would you feel if someone showed
up at a party wearing a sombrero

25:34.875 --> 25:36.058
and pushing a lawnmower
and said they were Latino?

25:36.110 --> 25:37.943
I'd be offended.

25:37.995 --> 25:40.929
- See?
- But I'd still defend his right

25:40.964 --> 25:42.864
to wear whatever he wanted.

25:42.900 --> 25:44.933
Just like I have the
freedom to call him an ass.

25:47.838 --> 25:50.822
Do you think that writing
the op-ed was a mistake?

25:50.858 --> 25:53.825
I may not agree with your point of view,

25:53.877 --> 25:56.144
but I raised you to fight
for what you believe in.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.779
And you're doing that.

25:57.815 --> 25:59.698
Thanks.

26:09.059 --> 26:11.176
Hi. I got you your latte...

26:11.178 --> 26:12.994
What the hell is this?

26:14.214 --> 26:15.964
An owl?

26:17.017 --> 26:19.101
I was just trying to
make the customer happy.

26:19.153 --> 26:21.119
She was looking for
a very specific piece,

26:21.121 --> 26:24.022
and I happened to have
something like it in my book,

26:24.057 --> 26:25.957
and I made the sale!

26:25.993 --> 26:27.826
You can check the money in the register.

26:27.861 --> 26:30.796
You showed a customer your book?

26:30.831 --> 26:32.864
Um...

26:32.900 --> 26:34.783
Because I had what she wanted.

26:34.818 --> 26:37.936
I'm so sorry. I promise
it won't happen again.

26:37.938 --> 26:39.871
I know it won't,

26:39.907 --> 26:41.756
because you're fired.

26:46.763 --> 26:48.713
Chris: I think I really
like it here at UMKC.

26:48.765 --> 26:51.066
That's great. Well, we
really want to make this work.

26:51.101 --> 26:53.151
Good. So, let's get down to business.

26:53.203 --> 26:55.170
Actually, there's not
gonna be any business,

26:55.222 --> 26:56.822
or car, or anything like that.

26:56.857 --> 27:00.959
I mean, I really don't know what
other schools are offering you,

27:00.994 --> 27:04.896
but what I have beats
the hell out of a car

27:04.948 --> 27:06.915
or a little bit of flash money.

27:06.967 --> 27:10.852
You see, John Kennish
is an incredible coach,

27:10.904 --> 27:14.039
and he cares about
every one of his players.

27:14.041 --> 27:15.857
And make no mistake about it,

27:15.893 --> 27:18.860
he is going to take this
team to the regionals,

27:18.912 --> 27:21.847
and then to the College World Series.

27:21.899 --> 27:25.767
Chris, if you decide to come here,

27:25.802 --> 27:27.295
Coach Kennish is going to make sure

27:27.296 --> 27:29.586
that you get a long look from the pros.

27:29.773 --> 27:32.073
And he can do that, because
he was in the majors.

27:32.125 --> 27:34.176
And one more thing. I will make sure

27:34.228 --> 27:37.145
that you get a first-class education

27:37.197 --> 27:38.730
and graduate with a degree.

27:40.234 --> 27:43.134
So think long and hard about this,

27:43.187 --> 27:48.056
because what I have to
offer you is a future.

27:48.091 --> 27:51.960
And compared to that,
a car is chump change.

27:54.047 --> 27:56.898
No offense, but that's
easy for you to say

27:56.934 --> 27:59.784
sitting in that big
house in Mission Hills.

27:59.836 --> 28:00.969
But me?

28:03.824 --> 28:05.824
I gotta get paid.

28:10.831 --> 28:11.746
(sighs)

28:13.547 --> 28:14.805
_

28:15.536 --> 28:17.102
I got fired.

28:17.103 --> 28:19.903
_

28:21.058 --> 28:22.474
Can we just get out of here?

28:23.075 --> 28:27.190
_

28:27.515 --> 28:28.430
Why?

28:28.431 --> 28:31.450
_

28:31.451 --> 28:34.945
_

28:35.306 --> 28:38.240
I cannot believe this.
This city is a jinx.

28:38.276 --> 28:40.409
It's like there's a full-on
conspiracy to keep us apart.

28:40.410 --> 28:45.230
_

28:45.316 --> 28:47.399
No. No, you're right.

28:47.401 --> 28:50.152
You can't do that.

28:51.355 --> 28:55.157
Sometimes I wish we
never came back home.

28:55.209 --> 28:58.177
Back there it was just
me and you and Daphne,

28:58.179 --> 29:00.145
and there were no parents,

29:00.181 --> 29:05.084
no old boyfriends, no
bosses to get in the way.

29:05.136 --> 29:07.036
(sighs)

29:15.096 --> 29:16.095
♪ Hey! ♪

29:16.097 --> 29:18.163
('80s music playing)

29:18.199 --> 29:20.032
Come on.

29:20.084 --> 29:21.417
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:21.469 --> 29:24.103
You don't have to play
this dinosaur on my account.

29:24.105 --> 29:26.105
Oh, I'm not. I love these games.

29:26.107 --> 29:28.424
Plus, I spent three
years in Afghanistan.

29:28.459 --> 29:31.343
Make-believe violence
doesn't really interest me.

29:31.395 --> 29:34.330
And I won't give that
douche the satisfaction.

29:35.416 --> 29:37.249
- Hey, Regina?
- Yes?

29:37.301 --> 29:38.317
Hook me up with a latte?

29:38.352 --> 29:39.351
What the hell?

29:39.403 --> 29:40.352
- Oh, no!
- What is going on?

29:40.404 --> 29:42.371
- Is there a problem?
- Your wi-fi crapped out.

29:42.423 --> 29:44.206
I was about to hit Onyx.

29:44.242 --> 29:45.341
Okay, I'll go check the router,

29:45.393 --> 29:47.192
it'll be back up in two seconds.

29:47.194 --> 29:49.194
Doesn't matter. I'll have
to start the whole game over.

29:49.247 --> 29:51.263
This blows. I'm out of here.

29:51.299 --> 29:53.182
If they leave now, we're screwed.

29:53.217 --> 29:54.650
We still have the other games.

29:54.685 --> 29:55.922
Okay, hey, wait, wait, wait!

29:55.923 --> 29:58.673
If you guys stay and
play the arcade games,

29:58.678 --> 30:00.256
first round on the house.

30:00.308 --> 30:02.274
Ms. Pac-Man? No thanks.

30:02.276 --> 30:05.077
Why not? Are you afraid you can't beat

30:05.079 --> 30:08.063
the 1985 Kansas City
Ms. Pac-Man champion?

30:08.099 --> 30:10.532
Winner takes home tonight's tips.

30:12.136 --> 30:13.085
You're on.

30:13.137 --> 30:14.520
This way, my friend.

30:18.509 --> 30:20.092
Red! Sorry, guys.

30:20.127 --> 30:21.427
Hey. What happened?

30:21.429 --> 30:23.312
The RA board voted to keep me.

30:23.364 --> 30:26.332
What?

30:26.384 --> 30:28.364
Ugh. I used all that free speech stuff

30:28.365 --> 30:29.365
that you wrote for me in my meeting.

30:29.437 --> 30:30.486
I knew they'd get it.

30:30.538 --> 30:32.371
I couldn't have done it without you.

30:32.373 --> 30:35.391
Hey, I ordered an extra-large
vegetarian pizza for us to celebrate.

30:35.443 --> 30:37.309
All I want to do is
just pig out, watch TV,

30:37.361 --> 30:39.244
and forget this ever even happened.

30:39.246 --> 30:41.246
- It sounds perfect.
- Great.

30:41.248 --> 30:44.149
Um, actually, I'll meet
you in your room, okay?

30:44.151 --> 30:46.151
Okay, fair warning, you take too long,

30:46.203 --> 30:48.170
you're gonna be eating
vegetarian crusts for dinner.

30:48.222 --> 30:49.221
I'll hurry.

30:53.327 --> 30:54.543
(knocking)

30:59.700 --> 31:01.500
_

31:01.501 --> 31:03.400
_

31:04.001 --> 31:05.930
_

31:06.231 --> 31:09.300
_

31:15.683 --> 31:18.517
Luca: 10,000 more points and
you will beat his high score.

31:18.569 --> 31:20.319
You got this, Vasquez.

31:20.371 --> 31:21.487
Shh! You're distracting me.

31:21.539 --> 31:24.340
A true Ms. Pac-Man champion
plays with all her senses.

31:24.392 --> 31:28.177
(machine beeping)

31:28.212 --> 31:29.211
- Oh, yes!
- She won!

31:29.263 --> 31:32.164
- She won!
- (cheering)

31:32.199 --> 31:34.199
That was sick. You got some skills.

31:34.235 --> 31:35.150
Thanks, kid.

31:37.171 --> 31:38.303
Looks like you saved the night.

31:40.307 --> 31:43.125
Aidan: Mmm. You beat Ms. Pac-Man,

31:43.160 --> 31:45.127
we're still 200 bucks short of the goal.

31:45.162 --> 31:46.395
Evers is gonna fail us.

31:46.430 --> 31:49.114
We'd have been fine if your
ghetto Internet hadn't gone out.

31:49.150 --> 31:50.783
- Excuse me?
- Hey, you're wrong.

31:50.818 --> 31:52.118
Did you see how many
people stayed to watch

31:52.119 --> 31:53.700
Regina kick some nerd boy ass?

31:54.221 --> 31:56.105
People love the old arcade games.

31:56.140 --> 31:57.156
The games!

31:59.460 --> 32:00.559
Ah!

32:00.594 --> 32:04.396
Yes! If the other machines
have half this many quarters,

32:04.398 --> 32:06.365
we'll easily have 200 bucks.

32:08.419 --> 32:09.518
That one'll take about four hours.

32:12.406 --> 32:14.373
Excuse me. What do you want?

32:14.425 --> 32:17.443
Uh, I left my portfolio.

32:19.280 --> 32:21.263
I'm with a customer. You can wait.

32:22.383 --> 32:26.335
(conversing in Chinese)

32:36.230 --> 32:38.163
Hey, I need to talk to you.

32:38.165 --> 32:39.498
I'll get your book. Hold on.

32:39.550 --> 32:41.467
(Chinese conversation continues)

32:41.469 --> 32:43.152
Look, I really need to
talk to you, like, now!

32:43.187 --> 32:45.120
Seriously?

32:45.172 --> 32:49.441
(shouting in Chinese)

32:52.580 --> 32:54.379
Wha... what the hell was that?

32:54.381 --> 32:56.348
Those guys were talking
about robbing you!

32:59.203 --> 33:01.535
What, you want a thank you?

33:01.841 --> 33:03.658
I can handle myself.

33:03.710 --> 33:04.792
So can I.

33:06.679 --> 33:07.812
There's a lot of things
you don't know about me.

33:07.847 --> 33:10.631
I speak Mandarin, I know ASL,

33:10.667 --> 33:12.717
and I'm a great tattoo artist,

33:12.719 --> 33:15.603
which you would know if you
bothered to look at my work.

33:17.607 --> 33:19.524
Can I please just
have my portfolio back?

33:24.964 --> 33:25.930
Thank you.

33:29.869 --> 33:31.452
Look, um...

33:33.523 --> 33:34.805
I know what I did was wrong.

33:36.543 --> 33:37.925
I was just trying to impress you,

33:37.961 --> 33:40.895
and I guess I went about
it in a really stupid way.

33:40.947 --> 33:41.913
Hold up.

33:44.751 --> 33:47.818
You think I fired you because I'm
some kind of a hard-ass, don't you?

33:49.839 --> 33:52.640
What you don't get is that
when you did that tattoo,

33:52.675 --> 33:54.692
you put my whole business at risk.

33:54.694 --> 33:57.545
You don't have a health
permit. You're not licensed.

33:57.580 --> 33:59.630
You could have gotten me shut
down. I could have lost everything.

34:00.733 --> 34:01.649
I get that.

34:03.620 --> 34:04.552
I'm sorry.

34:08.608 --> 34:10.591
Hey.

34:10.627 --> 34:12.510
Let me see that portfolio.

34:19.502 --> 34:20.501
That's rad.

34:20.570 --> 34:22.485
Your design or the client's?

34:22.522 --> 34:23.521
Mine.

34:23.523 --> 34:24.789
Nice.

34:27.927 --> 34:29.893
I like the sword.

34:38.771 --> 34:41.706
So, what were you doing in China?

34:41.708 --> 34:43.774
It's a long story.

34:43.810 --> 34:44.842
Yeah. I bet it is.

34:44.844 --> 34:47.612
(calculator beeping)

34:47.664 --> 34:50.598
$584.

34:50.632 --> 34:52.717
Not bad.

34:52.719 --> 34:54.735
It's a good thing you
didn't return the games.

34:54.786 --> 34:56.536
We'd have been sunk.

34:57.657 --> 35:00.524
You know, it's funny.

35:00.560 --> 35:01.836
When I checked the office earlier,

35:01.837 --> 35:03.805
I saw that someone had
unplugged the router.

35:04.297 --> 35:06.464
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

35:08.484 --> 35:11.569
Luca! I can't believe you did that!

35:11.621 --> 35:14.505
- What if everybody had left?
- They weren't going to.

35:14.507 --> 35:16.807
Your arcade idea was good.

35:16.859 --> 35:18.909
That weasel was just
too pompous to admit it.

35:18.945 --> 35:22.430
But still! You took a big chance.

35:22.465 --> 35:23.898
Because I believed in you.

35:24.951 --> 35:26.784
Thank you.

35:31.774 --> 35:34.792
The 1985 Ms. Pac-Man champ, huh?

35:34.844 --> 35:35.843
Heh.

35:35.878 --> 35:38.646
That must make you at least...

35:38.698 --> 35:39.613
Stop it.

35:46.789 --> 35:49.623
You're not getting it, Vasquez.

35:49.659 --> 35:52.510
I don't care.

35:52.512 --> 35:54.612
Your age has never mattered to me.

35:56.749 --> 35:58.499
I like you.

35:59.669 --> 36:01.452
(whispers) And you like me.

36:04.457 --> 36:05.539
I do.

36:18.838 --> 36:21.839
There must be some other prospects.

36:21.841 --> 36:23.908
I made a thousand calls.

36:23.943 --> 36:26.827
It's just hard mid-season, you know?

36:26.879 --> 36:30.614
The situation with
Chris was really unique.

36:31.784 --> 36:34.618
I'm really sorry.

36:34.670 --> 36:37.688
With that kid's attitude,
what are you gonna do?

36:37.740 --> 36:39.707
But you know what?

36:39.742 --> 36:41.509
You've been great.

36:44.564 --> 36:45.646
I'll figure something out.

36:45.698 --> 36:47.465
(doorbell rings)

36:55.541 --> 36:57.541
I hope it's okay that I came by so late.

36:59.846 --> 37:00.861
Just wanted to give you this.

37:05.551 --> 37:07.518
Your signed letter of intent.

37:07.553 --> 37:09.403
We are thrilled.

37:09.455 --> 37:10.821
You made the right decision, son.

37:10.873 --> 37:14.725
Turns out it was my only decision.

37:14.777 --> 37:18.746
The NCAA found out the other
school was offering me a car,

37:18.781 --> 37:20.815
and well, they rescinded
their offer this afternoon.

37:22.685 --> 37:23.684
Oh, no.

37:23.736 --> 37:25.703
Well, I can't say I'm
sorry to hear that.

37:25.755 --> 37:28.639
I got big plans for you, Chris.

37:28.674 --> 37:31.609
You're gonna be happy
here. I'll see to it.

37:31.611 --> 37:32.660
Absolutely.

37:32.712 --> 37:34.795
I hope so.

37:34.831 --> 37:36.664
'Cause I need this.

37:46.726 --> 37:48.526
I can't believe it.

37:48.528 --> 37:50.661
Do you know how lucky we are?

37:50.696 --> 37:52.930
Luck had nothing to do with it.

37:52.965 --> 37:54.548
You made that phone call?

37:57.603 --> 37:59.537
Oh.

38:02.425 --> 38:05.810
I am really enjoying your fierce
sense of morality right now.

38:05.812 --> 38:08.412
(soft rock music playing)

38:25.748 --> 38:28.666
♪ We've got each other ♪

38:28.718 --> 38:32.686
♪ We circle back here after we... ♪

38:32.738 --> 38:33.737
What is all of this?

38:33.738 --> 38:40.500
_

38:49.755 --> 38:53.474
♪ It's the time of our life ♪

39:00.650 --> 39:03.584
♪ So hold on tight ♪

39:03.619 --> 39:06.554
Iris, are you okay?
I've been texting you.

39:06.589 --> 39:08.389
I know.

39:08.441 --> 39:09.473
Hang on, are you mad at me?

39:09.475 --> 39:11.492
- Are you kidding?
- Hold on.

39:11.527 --> 39:12.526
Talk to me.

39:14.864 --> 39:17.882
I don't want to talk to
you. I read your article.

39:17.884 --> 39:20.851
Then why are you acting
like this? I defended you.

39:20.903 --> 39:23.821
You basically said Mingo's
right to free speech

39:23.823 --> 39:25.823
trumps my need to have
a safe space on campus.

39:25.875 --> 39:28.759
Come on, college isn't
supposed to be a safe space.

39:28.811 --> 39:31.445
The whole reason we're here is
to be challenged intellectually.

39:31.480 --> 39:34.732
I'm not talking about
intellectual safety, Daphne.

39:34.784 --> 39:37.868
For you this is all just
some fun academic debate,

39:37.870 --> 39:41.438
but I'm talking about
my emotional safety.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.823
What do you mean?

39:45.745 --> 39:49.763
Everywhere I go on campus,
I have to be on guard.

39:49.799 --> 39:53.701
I have to put on
this... like, this armor

39:53.736 --> 39:55.653
to protect me from stuff you don't see.

39:55.655 --> 39:56.670
Like what?

39:57.757 --> 39:59.623
Like when I woke up

39:59.625 --> 40:03.727
to find a little tiny drawing of
the confederate flag on my door.

40:03.763 --> 40:06.780
Like when a frat guy told us

40:06.816 --> 40:09.733
their party was for "hot girls only,"

40:09.785 --> 40:12.720
but they really meant white girls.

40:12.755 --> 40:17.691
Like when my Geology professor
made a joke about "savages"

40:17.727 --> 40:19.743
- and looked right at me.
- Oh my god.

40:19.779 --> 40:22.579
Or, like the other
night, when I got home

40:22.615 --> 40:25.499
and my RA was making
fun of black people.

40:25.551 --> 40:26.717
- Iris...
- The dorm is my home.

40:26.752 --> 40:28.669
It's where I sleep. It's
the place I'm supposed

40:28.721 --> 40:30.638
to be able to take off that armor.

40:30.673 --> 40:34.558
But you're moving out because one
guy wore something that upset you?

40:35.728 --> 40:37.494
No.

40:37.546 --> 40:40.497
I'm moving out because
that guy was my RA,

40:40.549 --> 40:42.633
the person who's supposed to protect me,

40:42.668 --> 40:44.969
and there's nothing I can do about it.

40:46.589 --> 40:50.507
I'm tired of not having a voice.

40:52.011 --> 40:53.552
And I can't live in a
place that doesn't even ask

40:53.553 --> 40:56.680
black kids how they feel when
there's a race issue on the table.

40:59.602 --> 41:00.684
I had no idea.

41:02.521 --> 41:03.604
Well, now you do.
