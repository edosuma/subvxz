My husband has died and it seems
as though my head has been cut off.

00:03.260 --> 00:06.018
At dawn, you will find
yourself on the street.

00:06.020 --> 00:08.561
I've more pressing matters
than a widow's comfort.

00:08.563 --> 00:09.778
(THUNDER)

00:09.780 --> 00:12.738
Since that baby's been born,
Verity has such a need in her.

00:12.740 --> 00:15.018
I dare not look her in
the eye for fear of it.

00:15.020 --> 00:16.858
If you buy me from Master Massinger...

00:16.860 --> 00:19.498
Your master does not
wish to sell you, Pedro.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.538
Each man shall have his rightful share.

00:21.540 --> 00:24.818
- You can read that?
- I was returning them to Recorder Castell.

00:24.820 --> 00:27.658
- He was teaching me.
- You promised you would help.

00:27.660 --> 00:30.058
- I'll come and speak with ya.
- Who were you talking to?

00:30.060 --> 00:31.938
We heard your husband singing.

00:31.940 --> 00:35.378
An informer has been placed
amongst us. A Catholic spy.

00:35.380 --> 00:38.058
Why might the Governor
concern himself with spies?

00:38.060 --> 00:39.778
I want my home returned to me

00:39.780 --> 00:41.580
and then I will tell you who the Judas is.

02:02.380 --> 02:05.818
You cleared the tavern

02:05.820 --> 02:09.657
so that you might show your...
rising affections to your wife.

Hm.

02:12.260 --> 02:14.538
Did I?

02:14.540 --> 02:16.500
Is it any wonder I'm childless?

02:17.260 --> 02:20.418
I've been better pricked by

No, Pepper, I'm well enough.

Master Massinger.

03:54.980 --> 03:57.298
You should sell me to Governor Yeardley

03:57.300 --> 03:59.778
before he takes me from you. Hm.

03:59.780 --> 04:02.538
Your... insolence, Pedro,

04:02.540 --> 04:05.978
will see you chained
here for another day. Huh?

04:05.980 --> 04:07.540

04:10.900 --> 04:13.098
Damn it, Pedro.

Have you had enough of chains?

04:24.820 --> 04:26.538
James...

04:26.540 --> 04:28.658
will you speak to Mistress Castell?

04:28.660 --> 04:30.658
Tell her that her husband promised

04:30.660 --> 04:33.178
he would arrange for
the Governor to buy me.

04:33.180 --> 04:35.300
You think I can make her keep that pledge?

04:36.260 --> 04:38.138
But you will speak with her,

because you want Pedro's respect.

04:54.180 --> 04:57.898
Every piece of cargo on every ship

04:57.900 --> 04:59.938
belongs to the Company.

04:59.940 --> 05:01.738
They make it the law,

05:01.740 --> 05:05.818
so that they can sell it
at blood-sucking prices

05:05.820 --> 05:08.298
to line the pockets of Company men.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.538
- It's robbery.
- Yeah.

05:10.540 --> 05:13.858
The purpose of trade, madam, is profit.

05:13.860 --> 05:16.418
The Company exists to breed profit.

05:16.420 --> 05:19.538
Since the Company are the only
ones that supply the colony,

05:19.540 --> 05:23.138
they will decide what profit
they will make. (CHUCKLES)

05:23.140 --> 05:26.418
There's a certain economical
logic to it that's charming.

05:26.420 --> 05:29.538
Secretary Farlow, did ever
such truth ooze from a man?

05:29.540 --> 05:32.538
We know our place here and we
welcome it, don't we, Verity?

05:32.540 --> 05:35.098
- We do.
- Well...

05:35.100 --> 05:38.178

You'll... soon see the

06:08.940 --> 06:12.058
Dr Priestly was most eager
that I should alert you

06:12.060 --> 06:14.818
to the discovery of the
totems in Samuel's cabinet.

06:14.820 --> 06:16.498
As though he might find relief

06:16.500 --> 06:18.978
if Samuel were named
the papist of Jamestown

06:18.980 --> 06:21.138
If the King of Spain has a hireling here,

06:21.140 --> 06:23.178
our whole endeavour is made frail.

06:23.180 --> 06:24.818
Then why not arrest him now?

06:24.820 --> 06:27.018

06:27.020 --> 06:29.258
The last traitor caught here,

06:29.260 --> 06:31.258
a hole was bored in his tongue,

06:31.260 --> 06:32.658
both his arms were broken

06:32.660 --> 06:35.618
and he ran a phalanx of
militiamen armed with clubs.

06:35.620 --> 06:38.258
And we threw the Judas into the wilderness.

06:38.260 --> 06:41.778
In truth, Governor, I am
indifferent to a man's faith.

06:41.780 --> 06:44.938
Encourage the doctor to woo you, Jocelyn,

06:44.940 --> 06:47.218

that he can entrust you

06:47.220 --> 06:49.378
in whatever secrets he holds.

06:49.380 --> 06:52.018
- Doctor Priestley.
- Good morning, Governor.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.458
A fine day for it.

06:53.460 --> 06:56.258
Sir, there are those who wonder

06:56.260 --> 06:59.938
why the widow has such a
scented sway over our governor.

06:59.940 --> 07:03.898
They see not her guile
only your gullibility.

07:03.900 --> 07:08.098
I appreciate your concern, gentlemen,
but my whip hand is firm enough.

07:08.100 --> 07:11.300

09:25.060 --> 09:29.858
I witnessed the very words
of betrayal as he spoke them.

09:29.860 --> 09:33.018
Today, he's gone from our
fields to meet with Pamunkey.

09:55.140 --> 09:57.578

10:13.660 --> 10:15.898
I have shown you my thanks.

10:15.900 --> 10:18.858
Words are not enough, Silas.

10:18.860 --> 10:21.738

Now, show me a way that
I can pay my respects,

Sharrow is not possessed by greed.

his god will speak to him.

they not make us feeble?

12:27.980 --> 12:31.498
there are two pretty young men

extravagant debts in my name.

12:35.020 --> 12:38.858

will reach these shores

12:38.860 --> 12:41.978

13:06.620 --> 13:09.098
What have you done, Rutter?

13:09.100 --> 13:11.938
The Company...

13:11.940 --> 13:14.098
may own the cargo,

13:14.100 --> 13:17.138
but whose hands does it stand in? Huh?

13:17.140 --> 13:19.178
Mariners.

13:19.180 --> 13:21.658
And what does a sailor
like best in the world?

13:21.660 --> 13:22.778
Coin.

13:22.780 --> 13:26.778
OK. Are you proposing
that we rob the Company.

13:26.780 --> 13:29.778
The bettermost folk might
have their trade, lambkin,

13:29.780 --> 13:31.818
but we have ours.

13:31.820 --> 13:35.658
A backstairs operation,
where we'll sell what we buy.

13:35.660 --> 13:38.098
We'll be washed in pretty profits.

13:38.100 --> 13:40.458
Two fine gentlemen will
provide me with cargo

13:40.460 --> 13:43.858
- tomorrow at dawn at Dancing Point.
- Don't you so much as think

13:43.860 --> 13:46.858
of giving them one lone pin
of what I have tucked away.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.778
You will call me a man amongst men

13:48.780 --> 13:50.552
and you will pepper me
with thank-you kisses.

13:50.554 --> 13:51.698
Rutter...

13:51.700 --> 13:53.660
how much did you give them?

13:55.140 --> 13:57.698
It was necessary. The cargo
will make us plentiful.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.898
How much did you give them?

29:26.185 --> 29:28.585
he would never have let
them out of his hands.

29:29.905 --> 29:32.103
Did you have these in your possession?

29:32.105 --> 29:34.423
I did not steal them, masha.

29:34.425 --> 29:38.117
Widow Castell's maid
witnessed you with the folio.

29:38.119 --> 29:39.772
I was attempting to return it, sir.

29:39.774 --> 29:42.103
Yet you had it still when the
blacksmith took it from ya.

29:42.105 --> 29:45.063
I gave it to James Read, masha.

29:45.065 --> 29:48.823
Poetry... stolen.

29:48.825 --> 29:51.503
It's as though his grave has been defiled.

29:51.505 --> 29:53.783
Who am I to believe?

29:53.785 --> 29:55.943
A fine-born English woman

29:55.945 --> 29:58.583
or a dirt working blackamoor?

29:58.585 --> 30:00.183
Who is it that can testify

30:00.185 --> 30:02.943
the Recorder gave you these written words?

30:02.945 --> 30:04.983
No-one, sir.

30:04.985 --> 30:07.865
His kindness to me was between us two.

30:09.225 --> 30:12.343
Then, you are guilty.
This man belongs to me.

30:12.345 --> 30:14.343
I will punish him for any harm.

30:14.345 --> 30:17.183
Crime is the law's
employment, Master Massinger.

30:17.185 --> 30:20.263
I beg the court for true reparation.

30:20.265 --> 30:22.543
Let this man ought to
have his tongue bored,

30:22.545 --> 30:24.583
his both arms broken,

30:24.585 --> 30:28.103
let him walk between 40
militiamen with clubs,

30:28.105 --> 30:30.743
and then have him cast
out into the wilderness.

30:30.745 --> 30:33.783
That, gentlemen, seems to
me to be reasonable justice

30:33.785 --> 30:36.103

Widow Castell, is there nothing

30:43.265 --> 30:45.623
that can placate your claim for justice?

30:45.625 --> 30:48.865
The Angolans are so very
valuable to us, you see.

30:50.665 --> 30:52.743
If the negro belonged to you, sir,

30:52.745 --> 30:56.503
I believe I may forgo
the acquittance I am due,

30:56.505 --> 30:59.343
- since you are our governor.
- Madam, the law is not so weak

30:59.345 --> 31:01.503
- as to bend to your every whim.
- Enough!

31:01.505 --> 31:05.105
You, you and you...

31:06.865 --> 31:09.545
...we will talk and seal this matter.

31:13.905 --> 31:18.223
The marshal has accused the man
of a crime, he will be executed.

31:18.225 --> 31:20.225
You have one last chance, Massinger.

31:22.265 --> 31:25.543
I will trade you those two men there

31:25.545 --> 31:27.505
for Pedro.

31:30.825 --> 31:32.865
Then I am forced to deal.

31:34.865 --> 31:37.063
Mark this, Governor,

31:37.065 --> 31:42.025
this varlet won you the negro...

31:44.065 --> 31:47.463
...but with it comes a rack of hate

31:47.465 --> 31:51.785
that will stretch to the
very end of your living days.

32:07.705 --> 32:09.785
Pedro, the charge is dropped.

32:10.705 --> 32:12.783
From this day forth,

32:12.785 --> 32:14.745
you belong to our governor.

32:24.025 --> 32:26.103
Do you see now, Maria,

32:26.105 --> 32:28.103
the Governor loves me.

32:28.105 --> 32:30.143
He will not let me die.

32:30.145 --> 32:32.303
You know that Master Massinger keep me,

32:32.305 --> 32:34.183
he owns me now.

32:34.185 --> 32:36.703
I will make him happy and it'll begin.

32:36.705 --> 32:39.305
In time, we will be free.

32:40.465 --> 32:42.543
- A gift.
- Yes.

32:42.545 --> 32:46.223
I expect there is a reason you
covet this negro so well, Governor.

32:46.225 --> 32:48.263
The others look up to Pedro.

32:48.265 --> 32:50.225
I see every advantage in such a man.

32:51.825 --> 32:53.825
England craves tobacco.

32:54.705 --> 32:57.023
That means our yield will need to grow.

32:57.025 --> 33:00.183
That means we'll need
labour. Obedient labour.

full of men such as Pedro.
