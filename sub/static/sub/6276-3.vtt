00:11.458 --> 00:12.917
Previously on Ray Donovan:

00:13.000 --> 00:14.959
RAY:
I went to Mexico
and brought him back.

00:15.041 --> 00:16.250
It's out of my hands.

00:16.333 --> 00:17.291
You think I want him here?

00:17.375 --> 00:19.875
I'm so fucking tired
of you lying to me.

00:19.959 --> 00:20.792
Seany-boy, are you in there?

00:20.875 --> 00:23.792
Help me.
I can't, kid.

00:23.875 --> 00:24.625
(gunshot)
I'd like to ask you

00:24.709 --> 00:26.542
a few questions
about Sean Walker.

00:26.625 --> 00:27.917
You know his movie
Black Mass?

00:28.000 --> 00:29.291
I was a consultant on it.

00:29.375 --> 00:30.500
I need you to say

00:30.583 --> 00:31.583
that you were
with me last night.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.750
EZRA:
Ray said you'd
stolen a lot of money

00:33.834 --> 00:35.834
from Sully.
I did it for this chick,

00:35.917 --> 00:37.834
Claudette, my one true love.

00:37.917 --> 00:39.083
RAY: You like this place,
don't you?
BRIDGET: I do, Daddy.

00:39.166 --> 00:41.000
If I applied,
do you think I'd get in?

00:41.083 --> 00:44.792
I'm gonna make sure
that she is banned from

00:44.875 --> 00:46.250
Marlborough,
Harvard-Westlake...

00:46.333 --> 00:47.709
all of them.

00:47.792 --> 00:49.792
'Cause your husband
fucked my girlfriend.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.125
Aah!
Mrs. Sullivan,

00:51.208 --> 00:53.208
I'm Kate McPherson
from the Boston Globe.

00:53.291 --> 00:54.041
I'm writing a book
about your son.

00:54.125 --> 00:56.041
I don't think
he would have left you

00:56.125 --> 00:57.959
unless there was
some compelling reason.

00:58.041 --> 00:59.458
Do you think
Catherine was with him?

00:59.542 --> 01:01.125
He fucking murdered her.
The girlfriend?

01:01.208 --> 01:02.792
The FBI is lying.
I'm not sending

01:02.875 --> 01:05.583
you to L.A.
I'm going, Bob.

01:05.667 --> 01:06.792
RAY:
Lena, I need you and Avi

01:06.875 --> 01:08.208
to get me everything
you can on Ed Cochran.

01:08.291 --> 01:09.417
He's on the short list
to be the head of the FBI.

01:09.500 --> 01:12.291
RAY:
You put him on parole,
you won't be able

01:12.375 --> 01:13.583
to control him.
COCHRAN:
Well, I'm not gonna

01:13.667 --> 01:14.875
control him, Ray, you are.
If he fucks up,

01:14.959 --> 01:16.250
you're going
to Leavenworth with him.

01:16.333 --> 01:18.000
RAY:
$15,000...

01:18.083 --> 01:19.500
It's a lot
for a parole officer.

01:19.583 --> 01:20.458
Oh, yeah.

01:20.542 --> 01:22.625
You come with me,
or I'll violate

01:22.709 --> 01:25.667
your ass so fucking quick, you
won't know what fucking hit you.

01:25.750 --> 01:28.417
Price range gonna work?
Maybe Ray has more
than he lets on?

01:28.500 --> 01:30.834
RAY:
I want you to meet me
someplace. You like it?

01:30.917 --> 01:33.625
Really, Ray?
I'm gonna make it happen, Abs.

01:44.750 --> 01:46.667
(Spanish music playing)

02:02.709 --> 02:04.792
♪ ♪

02:24.542 --> 02:26.709
You can put me on
death fucking row

02:26.792 --> 02:28.375
before I peel another
carrot, motherfucker.

02:28.458 --> 02:31.834
No comprende,
asshole. Hmm?

02:31.917 --> 02:33.834
Do the job
you're paid for.

02:48.959 --> 02:51.500
The test for private schools
has five categories,

02:51.583 --> 02:53.125
across math, science

02:53.208 --> 02:55.583
and English. The
top score in each

02:55.667 --> 02:58.250
is a nine.

03:06.959 --> 03:11.083
Three nines and two eights.

03:11.166 --> 03:13.667
Wow.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.083
(soft chuckle)
So proud of you, Bridg.

03:15.166 --> 03:17.625
Wait, I didn't know
you still wanted

03:17.709 --> 03:19.500
to switch schools.

03:19.583 --> 03:20.917
I think I do, Daddy.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.417
RAY:
Why didn't you
say something?

03:22.500 --> 03:24.583
I wanted to take the test
to know if I had a chance.

03:24.667 --> 03:27.500
Uh, look,

03:27.583 --> 03:30.291
this is a good school.
But with the budget cuts,

03:30.375 --> 03:32.709
we don't have the facilities to
challenge students like Bridget.

03:32.792 --> 03:35.375
She belongs at a school
like Bel Air Academy.

03:38.917 --> 03:40.375
That door may be closed.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.041
(phone buzzes)

03:44.125 --> 03:44.417
We have to talk
about this.

03:47.709 --> 03:48.834
Hey.

03:48.917 --> 03:51.291
Put that away.

03:55.208 --> 03:56.750
So Sullivan comes to the marina,

03:56.834 --> 03:59.917
thinking he's getting on a boat
to Mexico with false passports.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.625
Now, he's a cagey bastard,
you know that.

04:03.709 --> 04:05.166
But we were ready for him.

04:05.250 --> 04:06.792
So when he drew his gun,

04:06.875 --> 04:07.959
Special Agent Barnes
drew his.

04:08.041 --> 04:10.417
When it was all over,

04:10.500 --> 04:13.000
my guy was still alive.

04:13.083 --> 04:14.792
I told him to his face,
I said, "Frank,

04:14.875 --> 04:16.500
you're a hero."

04:16.583 --> 04:19.083
He said, "Boss,
I'm just doing my job."

04:19.166 --> 04:21.250
When can I talk to him?

04:21.333 --> 04:23.500
I wish I could make him
available to you, I just can't.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.500
You're really not
gonna let me interview

04:25.583 --> 04:26.792
the agent that shot
Sully Sullivan?

04:26.875 --> 04:29.166
He's on another case,
Ms. McPherson.

04:29.250 --> 04:30.709
Anything else
I can help you with?

04:30.792 --> 04:31.917
Yeah.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.250
Mickey Donovan.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.166
He was part of Sully's
gang and he's paroled

04:36.250 --> 04:38.709
here in Los Angeles.

04:38.792 --> 04:40.333
Any connection?

04:40.417 --> 04:42.625
Donovan?

04:42.709 --> 04:43.333
Donovan...

04:43.417 --> 04:46.959
Uh, no, that name hasn't come up

04:47.041 --> 04:48.709
during this investigation.

04:48.792 --> 04:52.041
Huh.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.959
I'll talk to him.
What?

04:54.041 --> 04:56.709
I'll talk to Stu Feldman.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.375
What are you gonna talk about?

04:58.458 --> 05:01.041
He banned her from
Bel Air Academy, Ray, forever.

05:01.125 --> 05:03.041
(sighs)
I'll find a way, Abs, all right?

05:03.125 --> 05:03.709
What are you gonna
do, break his legs?

05:03.792 --> 05:06.083
Will you stop?

05:08.041 --> 05:09.625
Is he still with that girl?

05:15.125 --> 05:16.458
I don't know.

05:16.542 --> 05:18.458
Even if he is,
it doesn't matter.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.417
Look, Abs,

05:21.500 --> 05:24.417
this is my side
of the street, all right?

05:24.500 --> 05:26.875
You let me take care of it?

05:30.417 --> 05:33.583
Stop worrying so much.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.041
House in Trousdale,
kid in Bel Air--

05:35.125 --> 05:36.583
what are you so worried about?

05:38.834 --> 05:39.917
I'll see you later.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.041
I'm meeting Deb.
All right.

05:42.125 --> 05:44.041
See you, Bridg.

05:56.375 --> 05:57.583
Are you mad at me?

05:57.667 --> 05:58.917
Mad at you?

05:59.000 --> 06:01.417
Of course not.

06:01.500 --> 06:02.375
Proud of you.

06:02.458 --> 06:04.500
You know what you want,
you went after it.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.000
How'd you get so smart?

06:09.083 --> 06:11.291
I got it from you, Daddy.

06:11.375 --> 06:14.250
Nah. Your mom's the smart one.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.291
Sometimes she says
"irregardless"

06:16.375 --> 06:18.125
when the word
is "regardless."

06:18.208 --> 06:20.542
(short chuckle)
(laughs)

06:20.625 --> 06:22.542
Yeah, well, irregardless
of that, she's your mother

06:22.625 --> 06:24.667
and she loves you.

06:27.208 --> 06:29.959
So you want to go
to Bel Air, huh?

06:30.041 --> 06:32.166
I do, Daddy.

06:35.125 --> 06:37.667
What if they find out
that I was busted for pot?

06:37.750 --> 06:39.291
You weren't busted.
They let you go.

06:39.375 --> 06:42.000
One stupid cop made a mistake.
End of story.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.125
Then why can't we tell Mom?

06:44.208 --> 06:46.125
'Cause it'd freak her out.

06:46.208 --> 06:49.291
Why worry her over nothing?

06:49.375 --> 06:51.792
Daddy, it really seemed
like it wasn't random.

06:51.875 --> 06:53.750
Like it was about me.

06:54.542 --> 06:57.834
It wasn't about you, all right?

06:57.917 --> 06:59.875
Put that out of your head.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.500
See you later.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.417
Bye.

07:08.375 --> 07:09.834
Well, it's been
a pleasure talking to you.

07:09.917 --> 07:11.125
I hope you have a great stay
in Los Angeles.

07:11.208 --> 07:13.667
Sully had a girlfriend.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.125
Catherine Shaughnessy.

07:15.208 --> 07:17.000
She never left his
side for 20 years.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.250
You know where she is?

07:18.333 --> 07:19.125
Ms. McPherson...
Is she in hiding?

07:19.208 --> 07:22.083
Did she help you out?

07:23.417 --> 07:25.250
Off the record.

07:25.333 --> 07:27.166
Is Catherine Shaughnessy
in witness protection?

07:28.667 --> 07:30.583
I never go off the record.

07:34.750 --> 07:35.875
(phone rings)

07:35.959 --> 07:38.000
Yeah?

07:38.083 --> 07:40.083
Get the fuck in here
right the fuck now.

07:40.166 --> 07:41.834
I'm busy.

07:41.917 --> 07:43.375
Okay, Ray. Explain it

07:43.458 --> 07:46.000
to your wife and kids when the
SWAT team bangs down your door

07:46.083 --> 07:49.166
and drags you out of your
fucking house tonight.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.125
The fuck...

08:02.208 --> 08:04.375
All right, get out.

08:04.458 --> 08:05.333
Okay.

08:05.417 --> 08:07.083
Get out.

08:08.583 --> 08:11.625
Let's get this straight.
(door closes)

08:11.709 --> 08:14.458
You go near my family
or threaten them again,

08:14.542 --> 08:15.041
I'll fucking kill you.

08:15.125 --> 08:16.417
You understand?

08:16.500 --> 08:20.625
Who the fuck
is Catherine Shaughnessy?

08:23.083 --> 08:24.583
No one you need
to worry about.

08:24.667 --> 08:28.208
Then why is The Boston
Globe's Lois Lane

08:28.291 --> 08:30.208
asking me questions
about her?

08:36.500 --> 08:39.917
She was Sully's girlfriend.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.750
Where is she now?

08:41.834 --> 08:44.750
Aw, Jesus, here we go again.

08:44.834 --> 08:46.458
You don't want to know.

08:46.542 --> 08:48.291
Oh, but I really do.

08:48.375 --> 08:50.291
She's dead.

08:50.375 --> 08:53.291
Sully strangled her.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.417
My associate, Avi,
was driving 'em out here.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.125
He helped Sully
bury her in the desert.

08:58.208 --> 09:00.083
Jesus F. Christ.
I mean...

09:00.166 --> 09:03.291
Trust me, no one's
gonna find the body.

09:03.375 --> 09:05.041
Especially not a reporter
from Boston.

09:05.125 --> 09:09.291
She was also asking questions
about your father.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.959
What's her name?

09:14.041 --> 09:15.625
AVI:
Yeah, boss.

09:15.709 --> 09:17.667
There's a reporter from Boston
here, Kate McPherson.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.125
Get me everything
you can on her.

09:19.208 --> 09:20.291
Will do.

09:20.375 --> 09:22.250
And keep her away from Mick.

09:22.333 --> 09:24.250
(phone chimes off)

09:24.333 --> 09:25.667
(sighs)

09:41.250 --> 09:45.083
Ray, what do you think?

09:46.458 --> 09:48.917
It's a long way
from the Mouseketeers.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.250
You smell me?

09:56.333 --> 09:58.375
It's the deodorant

09:58.458 --> 10:01.792
I stole from your bathroom
the night you fucked me.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.500
(door opens)

10:03.583 --> 10:05.834
What are you doing here?

10:05.917 --> 10:07.583
Did I call you?

10:07.667 --> 10:07.959
Scott, did
he call me?

10:08.041 --> 10:09.875
No, Stu.

10:09.959 --> 10:11.000
Did he make an appointment?

10:11.083 --> 10:13.291
No, Stu.

10:15.709 --> 10:17.333
Hey, Ray,
buddy.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.542
What are you doing here?

10:25.291 --> 10:27.417
You ever take
testosterone?

10:27.500 --> 10:29.583
No.

10:30.291 --> 10:32.375
No, of course not.

10:32.458 --> 10:33.208
You know,
they probably

10:33.291 --> 10:35.333
milk it from you
like blood plasma.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.792
It's fucking
me up.

10:37.875 --> 10:38.583
I got pimples
all over my back

10:38.667 --> 10:41.208
and an abscess
on my ass so deep

10:41.291 --> 10:44.041
you could hide the profits
from five Tommy Wheeler movies.

10:44.125 --> 10:46.291
Your little
girlfriend?

10:46.375 --> 10:49.375
She's driving
me insane, man.

10:49.458 --> 10:52.333
I get her a record deal, right?

10:52.417 --> 10:54.166
The label sends her
to a stylist.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.000
$800 later,
they chop her hair off.

10:56.083 --> 10:58.583
Now she looks like my kid Jamie.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.875
I almost fucked him
the other night.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.458
All right, you came to me,

11:07.542 --> 11:10.041
so what do you want?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.917
My kid wants to go
to Bel Air Academy.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.208
The...

11:16.291 --> 11:18.542
Ray Donovan wants
a favor from me.

11:20.208 --> 11:21.625
Lexi Steele.

11:21.709 --> 11:22.667
You know her work?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.166
No.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.834
She's a porn star.

11:25.917 --> 11:27.375
She's been called
the Meryl Streep

11:27.458 --> 11:29.667
of the gang bang.

11:29.750 --> 11:31.417
And I have
tried 50 times

11:31.500 --> 11:33.792
to get this woman
to come

11:33.875 --> 11:35.959
and fuck me.

11:36.041 --> 11:38.333
But no matter what I offer,

11:38.417 --> 11:39.750
they pass.

11:39.834 --> 11:41.959
What would
you do, Ray?

11:42.041 --> 11:43.250
I'd leave that alone.
Yeah,

11:43.333 --> 11:45.917
well, I can't.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.792
You need to go

11:47.875 --> 11:50.166
and figure out why
she's turning me down

11:50.250 --> 11:52.458
and what I have to do
to get her to fuck me.

11:52.542 --> 11:54.291
I do this,

11:54.375 --> 11:56.083
Bridget goes to Bel Air?

12:09.583 --> 12:11.750
(Spanish music playing)

12:12.208 --> 12:14.709
(sighs)

12:14.792 --> 12:14.875
(exhales)

12:23.000 --> 12:23.041
Uh...

12:27.542 --> 12:29.625
I'm taking cinco.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.625
(overlapping chatter)

12:42.500 --> 12:44.583
Oh...

12:45.917 --> 12:48.250
What's up, carnal?
Gracias, amigo.

12:51.125 --> 12:52.834
I can't, fellas.

12:52.917 --> 12:55.333
They got me on parole.
They're testing my ass.

12:55.417 --> 12:57.375
I'm on parole,
too, ese.
Yeah.

12:57.458 --> 12:58.542
You gotta get one of these

12:58.625 --> 13:01.333
and then you can smoke.

13:01.417 --> 13:02.709
Get what?

13:02.792 --> 13:04.000
What is that, Pablo?

13:04.083 --> 13:05.542
It's my prescription, homes.

13:05.625 --> 13:06.500
They can't

13:06.583 --> 13:08.583
take away a man's
prescription medication.

13:08.667 --> 13:10.792
It's legal, man.

13:12.417 --> 13:13.750
Not for him.

13:13.834 --> 13:14.959
(men muttering)

13:22.834 --> 13:23.625
Why am I
so important to you?

13:23.709 --> 13:26.917
God sees every
sparrow that falls.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.333
Come on.

13:30.417 --> 13:32.333
I got something
for you.

13:43.375 --> 13:45.458
Sit down.

13:51.458 --> 13:53.125
You gotta do this here?

13:53.208 --> 13:55.750
Now, you charge it
half an hour

13:55.834 --> 13:58.000
for every 24 hours.

13:58.083 --> 13:58.959
And if you don't
make it home by 6:00,

13:59.041 --> 14:02.417
you'd better call me,
do you understand?

14:02.500 --> 14:04.375
Or do I have
to say that in Spanish?

14:04.458 --> 14:07.041
I got it.

14:07.125 --> 14:08.458
Sit down.

14:08.542 --> 14:10.458
You're here...

14:10.542 --> 14:12.542
during the day.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.792
You're home during the night.

14:16.166 --> 14:19.250
Do all your clients get
this personal attention?

14:19.333 --> 14:20.667
No.

14:20.750 --> 14:21.417
Only the ones I like.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.417
(phone ringing)

14:23.500 --> 14:24.959
Answer that.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.750
(sighs)

14:31.875 --> 14:33.875
Mick, it's Claudette.

14:33.959 --> 14:35.875
Claudette.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.166
(sighs)

14:37.250 --> 14:38.750
To hear your voice right now--

14:38.834 --> 14:40.917
you don't know
how it just saved my life.

14:41.000 --> 14:41.542
Where are you?

14:41.625 --> 14:43.750
I'm here in town.

14:43.834 --> 14:44.750
I have to see you.

14:44.834 --> 14:47.375
Is 6:00 too early for dinner?

14:47.458 --> 14:49.125
No.

14:49.208 --> 14:50.625
What's your favorite
place to go in town?

14:50.709 --> 14:51.667
Mick, that's not
why I'm calling.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.458
Ever been to
Musso and Franks?

14:53.542 --> 14:55.417
6:00 p.m. See you there.

14:57.041 --> 14:57.750
Is that your lady friend?

14:57.834 --> 15:00.625
She can meet you
at your place.

15:00.709 --> 15:02.834
That's the mother
of my youngest son.

15:02.917 --> 15:05.792
We have parenting issues
to discuss.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.375
Okay. How old is your son?

15:08.458 --> 15:10.667
30.

15:11.375 --> 15:14.583
Then she could be Mother Teresa.

15:14.667 --> 15:17.458
If that monitor shows up
on Hollywood Boulevard,

15:17.542 --> 15:19.667
your ass is going
back to prison.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.917
Now you get back to work.

15:26.875 --> 15:29.375
DEB:
This area was out of favor
for a while,

15:29.458 --> 15:31.250
but it's coming back.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.208
This is the time to buy.

15:33.291 --> 15:35.834
And it's much closer
to Bel Air Academy.

15:35.917 --> 15:37.834
Who's going
to Bel Air?

15:37.917 --> 15:40.083
Maybe Bridget is.

15:40.166 --> 15:42.083
She aced the test.

15:42.166 --> 15:43.667
Can you believe it?

15:43.750 --> 15:45.583
She is a fucking genius.

15:45.667 --> 15:46.709
Oh, honey, I am
so happy for you.

15:46.792 --> 15:50.125
I know.
(knocking)

15:50.208 --> 15:50.375
Hello?

15:50.458 --> 15:51.709
Yes?

15:51.792 --> 15:54.500
Judy Hoffman. Neighbor.

15:54.583 --> 15:56.000
Hi. I saw the door

15:56.083 --> 15:56.667
was open, and I was
hoping for a peek.

15:56.750 --> 15:59.333
I live across
the street.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.583
Come in. This is
Abby Donovan.

16:00.667 --> 16:03.375
I'm Deb Goldman.

16:03.458 --> 16:05.625
May be your new neighbor.

16:05.709 --> 16:07.625
Such a beautiful house.

16:07.709 --> 16:09.709
I love this architecture.

16:09.792 --> 16:11.375
Oh.

16:11.458 --> 16:12.542
You're from Boston.

16:12.625 --> 16:14.542
Calabasas.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.709
But originally.

16:16.792 --> 16:19.083
Do I know you?
No.

16:19.166 --> 16:20.458
As soon as you said
"nay-buh" and "ah-ki-tek-chuh,"

16:20.542 --> 16:22.959
you gave it away.

16:24.166 --> 16:25.166
I find it charming.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.750
Charming. Really?

16:27.500 --> 16:30.041
(laughs)

16:30.125 --> 16:32.542
Do you think your speech
sounds natural to me?

16:32.625 --> 16:35.291
Your flat, dead,
Valley girl, California,

16:35.375 --> 16:38.166
take-my-teens-
to-the-fucking-mall accent?

16:38.250 --> 16:39.041
DEB:
Abby?

16:39.125 --> 16:42.250
We have other
houses to see.
Hmm.

16:47.750 --> 16:50.709
(crowd chatter)

16:50.792 --> 16:52.750
(phone chimes)

16:55.208 --> 16:57.417
(sighs)

17:06.000 --> 17:07.250
Yeah.
Oh.

17:07.333 --> 17:08.333
(woman laughs)
Mmm.

17:08.417 --> 17:10.917
I think I know a few people
who know you, Ray.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.250
I've-I've heard your name.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.083
How can I help you?

17:14.166 --> 17:17.083
I got a client who's, uh,
willing to pay $20,000

17:17.166 --> 17:19.000
to have sex with one
of your actresses.

17:19.083 --> 17:20.417
My choice or his?

17:20.500 --> 17:21.959
Lexi Steele.

17:24.375 --> 17:26.125
Lexi Steele's my wife.

17:26.208 --> 17:29.291
How about I offer you 20
grand to fuck your wife?

17:29.375 --> 17:31.000
You gonna take that deal?

17:31.083 --> 17:34.000
No, I wouldn't.

17:34.083 --> 17:36.875
Does this look
like a brothel to you?

17:36.959 --> 17:38.959
My wife is a... is an actress.

17:39.041 --> 17:40.625
She's not a prostitute.

17:40.709 --> 17:43.500
She makes movies with other
professional porn actors

17:43.583 --> 17:47.417
who are tested regularly
by doctors, and we have a guild.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.917
We win awards,
we pay taxes.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.542
I get it. I get it.
You have standards.

17:51.625 --> 17:52.792
Fucking A right.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.125
I got standards.

17:54.208 --> 17:57.625
The last guy who treated my wife
like a whore-- I tied him up!

17:57.709 --> 18:00.625
And I put him in a closet
for three days.

18:00.709 --> 18:03.125
Really?

18:03.208 --> 18:04.834
Yeah.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.250
Good to know.

18:08.417 --> 18:09.667
Can I take one of those

18:09.750 --> 18:13.375
for my client?

18:13.458 --> 18:16.041
Well, I get $50 for those
at the porn conventions.

18:16.125 --> 18:17.417
People line up
for hours, so...

18:17.500 --> 18:20.333
Sure.

18:20.417 --> 18:22.291
(woman moaning on screen)

18:25.000 --> 18:27.917
(music playing on car radio)

18:32.792 --> 18:34.750
(turns radio off)

18:34.834 --> 18:35.625
Ray,

18:35.709 --> 18:38.000
Katherine McPherson,
38 years old.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.083
She's a reporter.
She writes books.

18:39.166 --> 18:42.041
And she only got
into L.A. last night.

18:42.125 --> 18:44.875
So she comes here the day after
Cochran's press conference.

18:44.959 --> 18:45.875
Where is she now?

18:45.959 --> 18:48.125
Just walked into Fite Club.

18:48.208 --> 18:50.583
Oh, fuck. Don't let her leave.

18:50.667 --> 18:53.291
I'm on my way.

19:09.792 --> 19:11.291
(music plays quietly,
indistinct chatter)

19:17.125 --> 19:19.709
Can I help you?

19:19.792 --> 19:21.375
You're Terry Donovan.

19:21.458 --> 19:22.709
Yeah.

19:22.792 --> 19:24.709
Chuy Gomez, the
Garden. 1995.

19:24.792 --> 19:27.709
A hell of a fight.

19:27.792 --> 19:28.709
You were there?

19:28.792 --> 19:31.959
My father was.

19:32.041 --> 19:34.000
Your father followed me?

19:34.083 --> 19:35.458
My father followed

19:35.542 --> 19:38.709
anyone who was white and made it
more than five rounds.

19:44.959 --> 19:47.917
I'm working on a book
about Sully Sullivan.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.250
So what's that got
to do with me?

19:51.333 --> 19:54.291
Well, I'm looking for people
who knew him in the old days.

19:54.375 --> 19:56.458
Your father's name came up.

19:56.542 --> 19:58.583
You know where
I can find him?

19:58.667 --> 20:00.917
He's not here.

20:01.625 --> 20:03.750
You know where he is?
No.

20:03.834 --> 20:07.375
Want to stick around,
it's 20 bucks to train.

20:13.041 --> 20:16.000
(indistinct chatter)

20:19.041 --> 20:20.208
I'll get us a table.

20:20.291 --> 20:23.792
Yeah, go on in ahead.
I'll be right in there.

20:23.875 --> 20:25.500
I'll just be a minute.
Yes, sir.

20:28.041 --> 20:30.125
I met with him.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.667
Oh, yes!

20:36.750 --> 20:38.917
Oh, you didn't.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.875
Oh, my God!

20:40.959 --> 20:44.917
When and where?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.709
Nowhere. It's not
gonna happen, Stu.

20:46.792 --> 20:48.959
What? Why?

20:49.041 --> 20:51.333
She's a professional.

20:51.417 --> 20:54.166
She only has sex with
other professionals.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.583
That's it?

20:55.667 --> 20:57.542
That's been the hang-up?

20:57.625 --> 21:00.917
Huh? She only fucks on camera?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
That's the game
they're playing?

21:03.083 --> 21:05.291
It's not a game, Stu.
It's their business.

21:05.375 --> 21:07.083
You know the difference
between you and me?
No.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.750
You take "no" for an answer.

21:11.917 --> 21:13.542
I can handle this myself.

21:13.625 --> 21:14.834
These are dangerous
people, Stu.

21:14.917 --> 21:17.542
Thank you, Ray.

21:17.625 --> 21:20.166
Fuck you. I don't
need you anymore.

21:24.542 --> 21:26.667
I'm sure that public school
is good enough

21:26.750 --> 21:28.625
for your little girl, Ray.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.875
Scott, I got
some very good news.

21:35.959 --> 21:38.542
Just listen.

21:38.625 --> 21:40.583
There's something
going on here, Bob.

21:41.959 --> 21:45.041
No. I'm staying with friends,
no hotel bill.

21:45.125 --> 21:47.542
No, I can't
leave yet.

21:47.625 --> 21:49.458
I'll call you.

21:53.291 --> 21:55.208
You all right?

21:55.291 --> 21:57.166
(scoffs)

21:57.250 --> 21:59.208
Some asshole
blocked me in.

21:59.291 --> 22:00.875
Happens all the time.

22:00.959 --> 22:03.250
It's my brother's place.

22:03.333 --> 22:05.333
You're a Donovan?

22:05.417 --> 22:07.083
Yeah.

22:07.166 --> 22:08.709
I'm Ray.

22:08.792 --> 22:10.792
Come on upstairs.
We'll sort it out.

22:13.125 --> 22:16.667
This whole Trousdale thing--
it's not really our world.

22:16.750 --> 22:20.208
Why? Because one nosey cunt
makes fun of your accent?

22:20.291 --> 22:21.542
It's a sign.

22:21.625 --> 22:22.125
No. "For Sale" is a sign.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.458
"In Escrow" is a sign.

22:24.542 --> 22:26.834
"Sold" is a sign.

22:26.917 --> 22:29.667
Do you think I was
welcomed with open arms

22:29.750 --> 22:31.917
when I first got
here? Come on.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.417
I was the mistress
for 20 years.

22:34.500 --> 22:35.959
I don't know.
Oh, fuck the bitch.

22:36.041 --> 22:38.083
You'll buy the house,

22:38.166 --> 22:39.583
add a second story,
and block her view.

22:39.667 --> 22:41.792
(both laugh)

22:41.875 --> 22:43.500
(cackling)

22:50.041 --> 22:52.083
(sighs)

22:52.166 --> 22:54.667
(indistinct shouting
in distance)

22:54.750 --> 22:56.667
MAN:
Federal or state?

22:59.542 --> 23:00.792
(sighs)

23:00.875 --> 23:01.959
Walpole, Mass.

23:02.041 --> 23:04.250
20 years. You?

23:04.333 --> 23:05.875
35 years.

23:05.959 --> 23:07.792
A variety of
institutions.

23:07.875 --> 23:10.959
Now I'm out on...
compassionate release.

23:11.041 --> 23:13.333
I guess that's good, huh?

23:13.417 --> 23:17.125
Uh... pancreatic cancer.

23:17.208 --> 23:18.500
Oh.

23:18.583 --> 23:19.959
They didn't
want to pay for

23:20.041 --> 23:21.166
the care. It's very expensive.

23:21.250 --> 23:22.625
Geez.

23:22.709 --> 23:24.709
That's a tough break.

23:24.792 --> 23:27.083
Mickey Donovan.

23:27.166 --> 23:30.917
Shorty. It's a long story.

23:31.000 --> 23:31.959
Long Story Shorty.

23:32.041 --> 23:34.625
(laughs)

23:34.709 --> 23:35.041
I like it.

23:35.125 --> 23:38.500
(both laugh)

23:38.583 --> 23:40.583
You... you want
some tools?

23:40.667 --> 23:41.166
I got some tools.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.083
You got a screwdriver?

23:43.166 --> 23:45.959
Let me see.

23:50.291 --> 23:53.125
(Mickey sighs)

23:53.208 --> 23:55.083
Let's see what you got.

23:55.166 --> 23:57.125
Yeah.

23:58.083 --> 23:59.333
(laughs)
Oh!

23:59.417 --> 24:02.875
Shit. It's a
fucking arsenal.

24:02.959 --> 24:06.917
Yeah.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Duct tape.

24:09.083 --> 24:11.083
Good for everything.

24:11.166 --> 24:13.250
(sighs)

24:14.125 --> 24:16.000
Got a date tonight.

24:16.083 --> 24:18.166
Musso and Franks.

24:18.250 --> 24:19.500
Mm.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.500
Class.

24:21.583 --> 24:22.667
(groaning)

24:25.625 --> 24:28.000
(groaning)

24:28.083 --> 24:29.917
(monitor buzzes,
Shorty laughs)

24:30.000 --> 24:33.959
(both laugh)

24:34.041 --> 24:37.834
Shorty...

24:37.917 --> 24:40.125
if I bring you back
something to eat,

24:40.208 --> 24:43.125
will you keep
this on your leg?

24:43.208 --> 24:45.000
Make it look like
I'm still here?

24:45.083 --> 24:50.208
Grilled white fish,
if they got it. No butter.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.542
Slice of lemon.
(laughs)

24:52.625 --> 24:53.417
Strap it on.
(laughs)
Strap it on.

24:53.500 --> 24:56.166
Then you can
hold this, see?

24:56.250 --> 24:57.250
There. I'd have
figured you

24:57.333 --> 24:58.709
for a steak kind of guy.

24:58.792 --> 25:02.709
Oh, you don't got the time
to know what I used to be.

25:02.792 --> 25:05.250
It's working.

25:05.333 --> 25:07.875
Here we go. Here
we go. Ready?

25:07.959 --> 25:09.875
Oh, yeah.

25:09.959 --> 25:11.875
(sighs)

25:11.959 --> 25:13.875
Done.

25:13.959 --> 25:16.041
(panting)

25:17.959 --> 25:20.041
(crying)

25:24.166 --> 25:26.125
(sniffling)

25:26.208 --> 25:27.375
I...

25:27.458 --> 25:31.083
Been a long since a... stranger

25:31.166 --> 25:33.125
give me a kindness.

25:33.208 --> 25:37.083
(laughs)
(coughs)

25:37.166 --> 25:38.291
(loud coughing)

25:38.375 --> 25:43.250
You're not
contagious, are you?

25:43.333 --> 25:45.500
(indistinct chatter)

25:49.000 --> 25:50.834
You talk to her?

25:50.917 --> 25:52.500
She's writing a book
about Sully

25:52.583 --> 25:54.875
and asking questions
about the old man.

25:54.959 --> 25:56.834
I didn't say nothing.

26:02.208 --> 26:05.041
(music plays)

26:08.250 --> 26:09.834
(sighs)

26:12.750 --> 26:15.792
Apparently,

26:15.875 --> 26:17.166
the guy's, uh,
in the shower.

26:17.250 --> 26:21.125
Should be out in a sec.

26:21.208 --> 26:23.208
I get you a Coke or something?

26:23.291 --> 26:25.291
Sure.

26:33.375 --> 26:35.458
My brother tells me
you're, uh,

26:35.542 --> 26:37.667
writing a book
about Sully Sullivan.

26:37.750 --> 26:39.583
That's right.

26:39.667 --> 26:41.542
Mm, and now that he's dead,

26:41.625 --> 26:43.500
guess you got
your ending, huh?

26:43.583 --> 26:47.166
I wouldn't be here
if I had my ending.

26:47.250 --> 26:49.667
Came to L.A. because
this is where he died.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.166
Trying to talk to
people who knew him,

26:51.250 --> 26:53.750
like your father.

26:53.834 --> 26:57.291
Pop never talks
about the old days, so...

26:57.375 --> 26:59.125
I don't think
he remembers 'em.

26:59.208 --> 27:02.166
I'd still like to talk to him.

27:02.709 --> 27:05.041
You always do this?

27:05.125 --> 27:07.125
What?

27:07.208 --> 27:09.458
Stand this close to people
when you're talking to 'em?

27:09.542 --> 27:12.208
It's a trick I picked up.

27:12.291 --> 27:13.375
Yeah? Where?

27:13.458 --> 27:15.041
Journalism school.

27:15.125 --> 27:17.959
Oh, right.

27:18.583 --> 27:21.291
I can't meet with him?

27:21.375 --> 27:23.166
Even just ask him
a few questions?

27:23.250 --> 27:24.417
He's old.

27:24.500 --> 27:25.583
You know? Fragile.

27:25.667 --> 27:28.333
Why drag him
through all that stuff?

27:30.667 --> 27:33.375
There's the asshole
that blocked you in.

27:33.458 --> 27:35.917
I'm really sorry.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.667
I'm moving the car now.

27:37.750 --> 27:40.625
(car horn honks in distance)

27:40.709 --> 27:41.834
(engine revs)

27:43.750 --> 27:45.041
Shorty?

27:45.125 --> 27:46.667
Yeah.

27:46.750 --> 27:50.458
You got any, uh,
aftershave or men's cologne?

27:50.542 --> 27:53.583
For a job interview or a woman?

27:53.667 --> 27:55.417
A woman.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.208
I got nothing.

27:57.291 --> 28:00.458
(laughs)

28:03.041 --> 28:05.083
Do you think I'm a moron?

28:05.166 --> 28:06.583
Good question. I'm not competent

28:06.667 --> 28:08.125
to give
a professional evaluation.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.875
Stand against the wall.
Spread your legs.

28:21.417 --> 28:24.917
So now you're gonna tell me
it just flew away, right?

28:25.000 --> 28:27.250
It just fell off,
just like that.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.417
Things ain't made
like they used to.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.291
Where is the monitor?
Right here.

28:32.375 --> 28:35.333
I've been trying to fix it.

28:35.417 --> 28:37.542
(chuckles, coughing)

28:42.333 --> 28:44.417
Sit down.

28:45.208 --> 28:47.291
Ain't you never
loved nobody?

28:47.375 --> 28:48.875
Shut the fuck up.

28:48.959 --> 28:51.709
I'm assuming you have
'cause you're human.

28:51.792 --> 28:53.834
Listen, uh, I-I got to...

28:53.917 --> 28:55.458
I got to see Claudette tonight.

28:55.542 --> 28:59.166
There's no law against visitors.

28:59.250 --> 29:01.875
She can't see me like this.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.792
Done.

29:12.875 --> 29:14.667
There's no next time, Mickey.

29:14.750 --> 29:15.875
Nice watch.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.583
How'd you get it?

29:21.667 --> 29:22.792
Bought it.

29:22.875 --> 29:24.917
Where?

29:25.000 --> 29:27.291
Gem and Loan, pawnshop
in Beverly Hills.

29:27.375 --> 29:28.625
How much you
pay for it?

29:28.709 --> 29:29.875
No more questions, Donovan.

29:33.166 --> 29:36.959
I bet you paid a lot more
than money for that watch,

29:37.041 --> 29:38.250
didn't you?

29:38.333 --> 29:40.834
Cost you a piece
of your soul, right?

29:40.917 --> 29:41.959
Right?

29:58.625 --> 30:01.208
(beeping)

30:05.458 --> 30:09.500
Claudette, it's me.

30:09.583 --> 30:12.166
Listen, um...

30:12.250 --> 30:13.792
there's been a change of plans.

30:13.875 --> 30:15.083
I can't make it.

30:15.166 --> 30:18.000
I need to see you, Mick.
It's important.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.875
(sighs)
Honey,

30:21.959 --> 30:23.834
I don't want you
to see me living like this.

30:23.917 --> 30:29.083
I don't care.
What's the address?

30:29.166 --> 30:32.083
Look, if Pop and Sully
had ever met,

30:32.166 --> 30:34.041
I'm sure I'd have known
about it.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.083
Sounds like you two
are close.

30:36.166 --> 30:39.000
Oh, yeah. He's my father.

30:39.083 --> 30:41.959
Well, if there's any way
I could talk to him,

30:42.041 --> 30:44.625
even if there's
one Sully story,

30:44.709 --> 30:45.875
I'd like to hear it.

30:45.959 --> 30:47.583
He's a tired old con.

30:47.667 --> 30:49.709
Sure, he made a lot
of stupid mistakes,

30:49.792 --> 30:51.667
but he paid for 'em.

30:51.750 --> 30:54.750
We all did.

30:54.834 --> 30:57.333
Do me a favor,
give him a break, all right?

31:04.917 --> 31:06.959
Thanks for your help, Ray.

31:09.667 --> 31:11.375
(engine starts)

31:25.458 --> 31:28.667
You signed a confidentiality
agreement. Remember that, Scott.

31:28.750 --> 31:30.792
(sighs)
Yes, Stu.

31:30.875 --> 31:34.458
What happens on Stage 6
stays on Stage 6.

31:34.542 --> 31:36.625
Yes, Stu.

31:51.709 --> 31:53.750
Hi. I'm Rod.

31:53.834 --> 31:56.959
Jesus, how did you score
this set?

31:57.041 --> 31:58.166
I have connections, man.

31:59.917 --> 32:03.291
They want it back
in an hour, so...

32:03.375 --> 32:05.041
Okay, Rod, do you have the money
and, uh, health certificate?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:17.959 --> 32:20.000
Where's your cameraman?

32:20.083 --> 32:21.834
I'm doing this P.O.V., you know,

32:21.917 --> 32:23.333
handheld.

32:23.417 --> 32:24.834
Smart.

32:24.917 --> 32:27.500
Okay. Let's get rolling, Lexi.

32:27.583 --> 32:30.458
(clears throat)

32:32.875 --> 32:36.291
Yeah. I've met a lot
of stars, but...

32:36.375 --> 32:37.583
What's the scene?

32:37.667 --> 32:41.083
We're the last two people
on Earth...

32:41.166 --> 32:45.959
and you're sucking my dick.

32:46.041 --> 32:47.083
Okay.

32:50.625 --> 32:52.250
LEXI:
Ooh.

32:52.333 --> 32:54.208
Oh, yeah.
(moaning)

32:56.291 --> 32:59.458
Ooh, yeah. Ooh, yeah.

32:59.542 --> 33:01.625
(moaning)

33:02.500 --> 33:06.333
Ooh, yeah.

33:06.417 --> 33:08.041
Ooh, yeah.

33:08.125 --> 33:10.834
(moaning)

33:19.542 --> 33:22.291
Ricky.

33:22.667 --> 33:26.208
Camera down!

33:27.834 --> 33:29.625
Hey!

33:29.709 --> 33:31.917
(grunts)
(shouts)

33:32.625 --> 33:34.000
Hey.

33:34.083 --> 33:34.959
(groans)

33:35.041 --> 33:36.750
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

33:36.834 --> 33:38.750
What the fuck are you doing?

33:38.834 --> 33:41.250
I dropped the camera.
No.

33:41.333 --> 33:43.792
You didn't drop the camera--
you put the camera down.

33:43.875 --> 33:45.750
This is my wife.

33:45.834 --> 33:47.709
You're not making a movie.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.417
Oh, I'm not making a movie?
No.

33:49.500 --> 33:52.875
I'm the biggest producer
on this lot.

33:52.959 --> 33:55.500
You are? Really?
Yes.

33:55.583 --> 33:57.625
This is my set.

33:58.709 --> 34:01.625
I'm fucking Stu Feldman!

34:01.709 --> 34:06.291
I own this fucking town!

34:06.667 --> 34:09.333
(grunts)

34:12.208 --> 34:16.458
He's buying me
the house of my dreams.

34:16.542 --> 34:19.291
And he's getting Bridget into
the best school in the city.

34:19.375 --> 34:21.625
Mmm.

34:21.709 --> 34:23.917
It's not easy
for him.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.667
You saw that
in one session--

34:26.750 --> 34:29.291
Ray's very proud.
Yes.

34:32.458 --> 34:36.250
There's this guy
that he has to deal with.

34:36.333 --> 34:38.208
He's a fucking prick.

34:39.333 --> 34:42.375
Ray has to go to him
and beg him

34:42.458 --> 34:45.375
for a favor.
(chuckles)

34:46.083 --> 34:49.291
He has to swallow his pride.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.208
He's doing that for Bridget.

34:59.583 --> 35:01.417
(sniffling)

35:03.750 --> 35:04.667
Why are you crying, Abby?

35:04.750 --> 35:07.125
Instead of...

35:07.208 --> 35:09.750
being grateful
for all the beautiful things

35:09.834 --> 35:11.792
he's doing for my family...

35:11.875 --> 35:15.667
I've been so selfish.

35:15.750 --> 35:16.917
Have you talked
about the abuse?

35:17.000 --> 35:18.917
He's giving me so much.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.542
Why can't you see that?

35:31.542 --> 35:33.750
What did you just write?

35:41.917 --> 35:43.417
(sighs)

35:52.166 --> 35:53.250
Baby.

35:58.250 --> 36:01.166
RAY:
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, they knocked me out

36:01.250 --> 36:03.208
and threw me in
the trunk of the car.

36:03.291 --> 36:05.166
Who did, Stu?

36:05.250 --> 36:06.542
Cut the shit, Ray.

36:06.625 --> 36:08.709
You knew this was gonna happen.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.792
Help me out and, uh, I will keep

36:16.875 --> 36:18.542
my promise.
Just get me out of this,

36:18.625 --> 36:19.917
and Bridget goes
to Bel Air.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.542
(whispers):
Money.
Ray, go to my safe

36:22.625 --> 36:24.709
and get 100...

36:27.125 --> 36:28.917
...$200,000

36:29.000 --> 36:30.166
and, uh, bring
it to, uh...

36:30.250 --> 36:33.291
What's the address
of this shithole?

36:33.375 --> 36:35.291
I know where you are.

36:38.417 --> 36:38.917
Amen, motherfucker.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.208
(gunfire)
(grunting)

36:46.041 --> 36:49.125
(dramatic music playing)

36:49.959 --> 36:53.041
God, I love
crap like this.

36:53.125 --> 36:55.333
I can't believe
he's dead.

36:55.417 --> 36:57.125
ANNOUNCER:
The Sean Walker marathon
will continue

36:57.208 --> 36:58.792
with Black Mass 2 up next.

36:58.875 --> 37:01.542
More wine?
Mm-hmm.

37:01.625 --> 37:03.291
But something different.
I feel like...

37:03.375 --> 37:06.291
like action sequels are best
with a pinot noir.

37:06.375 --> 37:09.375
I think sequels go
better with beer.

37:25.583 --> 37:29.500
Amy, what does a consultant do
on a movie?

37:50.000 --> 37:50.834
(grunts)

37:50.917 --> 37:52.667
Where is he?

37:52.750 --> 37:53.709
Why?

37:53.792 --> 37:56.500
Because you kidnapped my client.
He put the camera

37:56.583 --> 37:59.083
down!
STU:
Ray!

37:59.166 --> 38:02.083
He'd better be able
to walk out of here.

38:02.166 --> 38:04.583
Dude...

38:04.667 --> 38:06.500
Oh, God.

38:10.166 --> 38:13.417
Hey. You ever do porn?

38:13.500 --> 38:15.709
This indie look
is really in right now.

38:15.792 --> 38:18.083
It was...

38:18.166 --> 38:20.458
it was the testosterone.

38:20.542 --> 38:22.375
I mean, this is dangerous stuff.

38:22.458 --> 38:24.417
I mean, people need to know.

38:33.583 --> 38:37.291
Hi, this is Susanna Trane
from Peet's Coffee.

38:37.375 --> 38:40.417
We have a program
for hiring seniors,

38:40.500 --> 38:43.417
and one of your parolees,
Michael Donovan,

38:43.500 --> 38:45.166
applied for a job here,

38:45.250 --> 38:48.583
but we don't have
a current address for him.

38:52.875 --> 38:54.959
Uh-huh.

38:58.834 --> 39:00.917
(sighing)

39:01.834 --> 39:03.917
(grunts)

39:07.500 --> 39:09.750
(grunting)

39:09.834 --> 39:12.917
(panting)

39:13.000 --> 39:15.125
She's got a rich husband.

39:15.208 --> 39:17.041
Provides big-time.

39:17.125 --> 39:20.333
Palm Springs mansion.

39:20.417 --> 39:22.041
(sighs)
Goddamn it.

39:22.125 --> 39:25.583
How did I end up here?

39:25.667 --> 39:26.291
(sighs)

39:26.375 --> 39:28.625
Women don't
care about that.

39:28.709 --> 39:31.041
If they love you,
they love you.

39:31.125 --> 39:34.834
Take a breath, man.

39:34.917 --> 39:38.041
(sighs)

39:53.375 --> 39:54.667
What?

39:54.750 --> 39:56.792
You don't want
the money.

39:56.875 --> 39:58.291
You keep talking,

39:58.375 --> 40:01.375
and I have
to start counting again.

40:01.458 --> 40:03.667
Do you want to stay here
all night?

40:05.291 --> 40:08.625
You keep the money,
you're a kidnapper.
Big deal.

40:08.709 --> 40:11.542
You're a kidnapper,
and you make your wife a whore.

40:11.625 --> 40:14.166
(scoffs)

40:24.625 --> 40:26.834
You don't want the money.

40:26.917 --> 40:28.417
No?

40:28.500 --> 40:29.500
What do I want?

40:29.583 --> 40:33.667
You ever get hit in the head
while you were coming?

40:33.750 --> 40:37.041
Not unless I threw
the first punch.

40:40.959 --> 40:41.208
(groans)
You all right?

40:41.291 --> 40:42.959
Yeah.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.667
(sniffs)

40:44.750 --> 40:47.333
The bag looks heavy.

40:47.417 --> 40:48.417
Ray, is there
still money in there?

40:48.500 --> 40:49.792
Is that
my money?

40:49.875 --> 40:50.917
Take him back to the studio.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.125
All right.

40:52.208 --> 40:54.166
(starts engine)

40:54.250 --> 40:57.041
Why?
Why are we...

40:57.125 --> 40:59.291
Why are we going back to
the studio? I want to go home!

40:59.375 --> 41:03.375
Ray, I want to go home! I don't
want to go to the studio!

41:03.458 --> 41:05.375
$200,000.

41:05.458 --> 41:07.083
Are you serious?

41:07.166 --> 41:09.959
What?
I can't run that much cash
through the gym, Ray.

41:10.041 --> 41:13.208
You need another shell.
I keep telling you, diversify.

41:13.291 --> 41:16.458
We're moving to Trousdale, kids
are going to private school.

41:16.542 --> 41:18.834
Trousdale?

41:18.917 --> 41:20.750
What is this, 1966

41:20.834 --> 41:23.125
and you're Nancy
fucking Sinatra?

41:25.083 --> 41:26.709
Hey.

41:26.792 --> 41:29.625
George Hamilton called--
he wants his bag back.

41:29.709 --> 41:31.709
The office just got a call
from a woman at Peet's

41:31.792 --> 41:35.458
who said your father had applied
for a job there

41:35.542 --> 41:37.250
and they want his address.

41:37.333 --> 41:38.542
Did you give it to 'em?

41:38.625 --> 41:39.083
No, I didn't.

41:39.166 --> 41:41.333
Lupita did.

41:41.417 --> 41:43.417
What the fuck is going on?

41:43.500 --> 41:44.917
Get him out of there
as fast as you can.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.083
All right.

41:48.166 --> 41:50.291
(crickets chirping)

41:59.583 --> 42:01.834
(phone chimes, buzzes)

42:05.166 --> 42:07.875
(scoffs)

42:07.959 --> 42:09.834
(doorbell rings)

42:13.000 --> 42:14.834
(loud knocking)

42:16.125 --> 42:19.750
(doorbell ringing)

42:27.500 --> 42:29.542
Shawty.

42:29.625 --> 42:31.959
Who the hell
do you think you are?

42:32.041 --> 42:33.208
Hey, you don't know?

42:33.291 --> 42:36.417
I'm Marvin Gaye.

42:36.500 --> 42:37.625
Washington.

42:37.709 --> 42:39.000
Washington.

42:39.083 --> 42:41.458
Jesus, Marvin,
what are you doing here?

42:41.542 --> 42:43.291
My dad will kill you.

42:43.375 --> 42:45.667
That nigga is crazy.

42:46.834 --> 42:47.917
But so am I.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.834
For you.

42:50.917 --> 42:52.250
You're hanging out with...

42:52.333 --> 42:54.333
supermodels and rock stars.

42:54.417 --> 42:56.208
You don't... need me.

42:56.291 --> 42:58.458
They ain't real.

42:58.542 --> 43:00.834
You're so full of shit, Marvin.

43:05.291 --> 43:08.083
I miss you, Bridg.

43:11.625 --> 43:13.083
(chuckles)

43:24.417 --> 43:26.458
You're following me?

43:26.542 --> 43:29.667
(sighs)
My father's
not coming home tonight.

43:29.750 --> 43:31.333
He's on
house arrest.

43:31.417 --> 43:32.166
He has to come home sometime.

43:32.250 --> 43:34.875
Not tonight.

43:38.542 --> 43:40.500
What the fuck
are you so afraid of?

43:48.834 --> 43:50.792
You want to go get a drink?

43:54.959 --> 43:55.917
Come on.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.750
(reporter speaking
indistinctly on television)

44:08.542 --> 44:13.041
Thank God you picked me up.

44:13.125 --> 44:16.125
God had nothing
to do with it.

44:18.500 --> 44:20.542
(squeals)
That was great!

44:20.625 --> 44:22.375
DIRECTOR:
Fucking... Ho,
ho, ho! Cut! Cut!

44:22.458 --> 44:25.208
Who the fuck is this asshole?!

44:25.291 --> 44:27.709
He's with me.

44:27.792 --> 44:29.500
Oh, okay. Okay.

44:29.583 --> 44:31.250
All right, Stu. That's... Okay.

44:31.333 --> 44:33.500
Let's, uh... Yeah, let's just...
We'll spin it back.

44:33.583 --> 44:33.917
Let's do it again.

44:53.041 --> 44:54.250
All right.

44:54.333 --> 44:57.083
You stay at the table. You
don't go to the bathroom.

44:57.166 --> 44:58.625
You have your dinner,
you pay your bill

44:58.709 --> 45:00.959
and you come right back
to the car, you understand?

45:01.041 --> 45:02.667
Are those your conditions
or Ray's?

45:02.750 --> 45:04.041
I guess
you done

45:04.125 --> 45:06.250
moved on up
to the big house now.

45:06.333 --> 45:06.959
Man, shut your fucking mouth.

45:07.041 --> 45:09.625
I'm doing you a fucking favor.

45:14.208 --> 45:16.792
Claudette.

45:16.875 --> 45:18.417
There she is.

45:18.500 --> 45:20.041
That woman is the mother
of your child?

45:23.417 --> 45:26.083
She's the love of my life.

45:29.375 --> 45:30.291
Claudette!

45:30.375 --> 45:31.709
(car door shuts)

45:33.625 --> 45:37.583
I'll be damned.

45:37.667 --> 45:40.417
Mm, mm, mm.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.709
(sighs)

45:46.792 --> 45:48.750
(indistinct chatter)
(dance music playing)

45:51.166 --> 45:53.083
(phone ringing)

45:55.959 --> 45:57.458
Yeah?

45:57.542 --> 46:00.417
I told you to take care of her,
not take her on a date.

46:02.417 --> 46:05.834
When is she going
back to Boston, Ray?

46:05.917 --> 46:08.875
You'll know when I do.

46:11.875 --> 46:12.917
You ready?
Yeah.

46:15.125 --> 46:17.750
WOMAN:
Why was apprehending

46:17.834 --> 46:20.500
Sully Sullivan such
a priority for you?

46:20.583 --> 46:23.291
Sully Sullivan was responsible
for 20 people being dead.

46:23.375 --> 46:24.792
That's terrorism.

46:24.875 --> 46:26.375
Isn't that a bit of a leap?

46:26.458 --> 46:28.542
Calling Sully Sullivan
a terrorist?

46:28.625 --> 46:29.667
Fear is fear.

46:29.750 --> 46:31.291
Terrorism is terrorism.

46:31.375 --> 46:33.291
Sullivan was
a domestic terrorist.

46:33.375 --> 46:34.000
For me,

46:34.083 --> 46:36.041
my first thought in the morning,

46:36.125 --> 46:37.583
my last thought at night

46:37.667 --> 46:39.542
is how can I protect Americans
from fear.

46:39.625 --> 46:42.583
That's my job.

46:42.667 --> 46:44.041
ANNOUNCER (on television):
Coming up next,

46:44.125 --> 46:45.625
the Internet-- is it dangerous?

46:45.709 --> 46:48.000
Is it real?
Is it perpetuating a myth...?

46:48.083 --> 46:51.333
You didn't tell me your father
was a consultant on Black Mass.

46:51.417 --> 46:52.542
Consultant?

46:52.625 --> 46:54.417
The only thing my father
did on that movie

46:54.500 --> 46:55.667
was to keep half of
Southie from walking off

46:55.750 --> 46:56.917
with all the lights and cameras.

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
And those people were
Sully and his friends?

47:01.083 --> 47:03.375
Sully didn't have friends.

47:03.458 --> 47:04.834
You either worked
for him or you didn't.

47:04.917 --> 47:06.709
If you didn't,
you were an enemy.

47:06.792 --> 47:08.583
So you were an enemy.

47:11.750 --> 47:13.875
I knew enough
to keep my distance.

47:13.959 --> 47:16.208
Well, that's pretty smart
for a boy from Southie.

47:16.291 --> 47:16.875
What do you know
about Southie?

47:17.000 --> 47:18.166
I'm writing a book about it.

47:18.250 --> 47:21.333
No, you're not. You're writing
a book about Sully Sullivan.

47:21.417 --> 47:23.583
A book about Sully is
a book about Southie.

47:23.667 --> 47:26.250
Is it?
Mm.

47:26.333 --> 47:28.625
You don't think I know
what I'm doing.

47:28.709 --> 47:29.959
I'm not sure yet.

47:30.041 --> 47:32.959
When I first came here,
I didn't think I had shit.

47:33.041 --> 47:34.333
Just a hunch.

47:34.417 --> 47:35.083
What do you got now?

47:37.333 --> 47:38.291
(sighs)

47:38.375 --> 47:42.625
Well, Cochran won't let me talk
to Frank Barnes.

47:42.709 --> 47:45.417
You won't let me talk
to your father.

47:47.125 --> 47:48.542
There's a story here,

47:48.625 --> 47:51.250
or you guys wouldn't be trying
so hard to keep me from it.

47:51.333 --> 47:53.959
(laughs)

47:58.458 --> 48:00.542
You want another drink?

48:00.625 --> 48:02.542
Yeah. You want another drink.

48:04.875 --> 48:08.625
I'm sorry for all
the to and fro today.

48:08.709 --> 48:10.291
I had a bit of a situation.

48:10.375 --> 48:13.125
Me, too.

48:13.208 --> 48:16.083
I was at the Beverly Hills
Police Department.

48:16.166 --> 48:18.959
They called me in.

48:19.041 --> 48:19.750
What'd they want?

48:19.834 --> 48:21.709
I had to sign a sworn statement

48:21.792 --> 48:23.625
about where I was the night

48:23.709 --> 48:26.875
that Sean Walker died.

48:26.959 --> 48:29.125
I swore that I was with you.

48:29.208 --> 48:32.041
Good.
(chuckles)

48:32.125 --> 48:33.417
This is the second time.

48:33.500 --> 48:35.333
They are not giving up on this.

48:35.417 --> 48:36.959
Aw, geez.

48:37.041 --> 48:39.250
Claudette, I'm sorry

48:39.333 --> 48:41.834
I dragged you into this mess.

48:42.959 --> 48:45.625
Well, dragged me
into what exactly?

48:45.709 --> 48:46.667
What happened that evening?

48:46.750 --> 48:49.625
Were you involved?

48:53.875 --> 48:57.667
It wasn't me who killed him.

48:57.750 --> 48:59.000
It was Sully.

48:59.083 --> 49:00.208
So, why do you need me?

49:02.375 --> 49:04.667
After this long, do I have
to tell you why I need you?

49:04.750 --> 49:07.000
I've always needed you.

49:07.083 --> 49:08.208
I love you.

49:08.709 --> 49:12.291
I love you, too.

49:12.375 --> 49:14.333
But I'm worried.

49:14.417 --> 49:16.792
I did what you asked.

49:16.875 --> 49:19.375
Now, what else do I have
to be worried about?

49:21.000 --> 49:22.291
Nothing.

49:30.709 --> 49:34.333
♪ How do I, how do I ♪

49:34.417 --> 49:37.875
♪ How do I,

49:37.959 --> 49:41.083

49:41.166 --> 49:45.000

50:07.208 --> 50:08.333
What was Japan like?

50:11.291 --> 50:13.208
Mostly I saw the hotel.

50:13.291 --> 50:15.250
But, uh, the shows,

50:15.333 --> 50:17.875
they was wild.

50:17.959 --> 50:21.125
