WEBVTT

00:13.513 --> 00:18.059
Oh, my God, Sonya, did I tell you
what Blake did for Gwen this weekend?

00:18.143 --> 00:20.729
Let me guess, another loving gesture?

00:20.812 --> 00:23.231
He made her breakfast in bed!

00:23.314 --> 00:26.401
It was B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

00:26.484 --> 00:30.530
That's from one of her songs,
and he made her banana pancakes too!

00:30.613 --> 00:33.950
Hey, have they ever fucked
on those spinning chairs?

00:34.034 --> 00:35.285
Sonya!

00:35.368 --> 00:36.411
Of course.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.665
-God, I love being a lovebug!
-Yeah, it's a living.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.419
Walter, this one's for you.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.587
Thanks, Emmy.

00:45.670 --> 00:47.630
Ooh! You look chipper this morning.

00:47.714 --> 00:51.676
I met a gremlin on the train,
and we're getting Negronis later!

00:51.760 --> 00:55.388
-I can't. She was 45 minutes late today.
-Ooh, a new assignment!

00:55.472 --> 00:58.224
"Love is in the Air, Bridgeton Middle."

00:58.308 --> 01:02.771
Oh, young love, it is so pure.
It's so passionate, so--

01:02.854 --> 01:03.897
So detached.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.483
-Kids these days, always on their phones.
-Hmm.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.694
They'd rather tweet at their senators
than actually talk to each other.

01:09.778 --> 01:12.030
Oh, wait, you've got one too.

01:12.113 --> 01:13.281
"Nick Birch."

01:13.364 --> 01:15.450
And I have "Jessi Glazer."

01:15.533 --> 01:17.786
-Jew!
-Ooh, you love those!

01:17.869 --> 01:21.206
Hi, guys, look who's here
to sell Penis Scout cookies!

01:21.289 --> 01:22.290
So cute!

01:22.373 --> 01:24.042
Don't feel obligated to buy any.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.461
That being said,
the Thin Dicks are pretty good.

01:26.544 --> 01:29.005
Especially if you put them in the freezer!

01:29.089 --> 01:32.801
Aww, come on, right?
I pocket all the money.

02:06.709 --> 02:11.339
Okay, Jay and Charles, it's your turn
to hug each other on the floor.

02:11.422 --> 02:13.842
Heads up,
sometimes when I wrestle, I black out

02:13.925 --> 02:17.554
because my brothers tea-bagged me
my senior year of Kindergarten.

02:17.637 --> 02:22.600
Okay, I'm feeling very self-conscious
in this tight, little singlet, Maury.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.395
I mean, my messed up dingle
hasn't even healed yet!

02:25.478 --> 02:27.063
Yeah, but that ass!

02:27.147 --> 02:29.149
What? You talkin' about this ass?

02:29.232 --> 02:32.110
Take that little blimp on a trip
around the world for everybody!

02:32.193 --> 02:33.736
-Oh, like this?
-Yeah!

02:33.820 --> 02:35.113
Put on a show, baby!

02:35.196 --> 02:37.448
I could do this all day.

02:37.532 --> 02:40.910
Me too. I just have a haircut
at30 that I can't miss.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.829
Wow, Maury, you are right.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.832
This singlet really shapes my bulbous ass.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.375
Whoa-ho-ho!

02:47.458 --> 02:48.751
Well, that's new.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.879
-Now you see me,

02:50.962 --> 02:52.547
-now you don't!

02:52.630 --> 02:54.716
-That's the end.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.092
Hey, what was that move?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.969
You mean my full-body sleight of hand?

02:58.052 --> 02:59.888
Fucking magic, obviously.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.973
-"Magic"? Tight.
-Are you making fun of me?

03:02.056 --> 03:04.392
Because I will have
a tea-bagging flashback

03:04.475 --> 03:06.019
right here, right now!

03:06.102 --> 03:08.313
I'm not playing. Magic's cool.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.898
"Cool"? Really--

03:12.192 --> 03:13.359
Wow, you really prepared.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.653
Well, it is the first meeting
of my affinity group…

03:15.737 --> 03:20.033
I mean, everyone's affinity group
that I organized and I am the head of.

03:20.116 --> 03:21.701
Hey, Nick. What are you doing here?

03:21.784 --> 03:23.620
Where are the allies supposed to go?

03:23.703 --> 03:25.413
You are so smooth, man.

03:25.496 --> 03:28.917
You are like a dolphin
that works at the lotion factory.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.085
Oh, dear Lord, he's with Rick?

03:31.169 --> 03:32.503
I thought Rick retired.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.088
I thought Rick died.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.174
Okay, welcome, everybody.

03:36.257 --> 03:39.886
I would like us to think of this meeting
as a serious partay,

03:39.969 --> 03:41.554
but instead of cheese doodles,

03:41.638 --> 03:44.349
it's issues…
…we'll be munching on.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.600
You can't eat issues!

03:45.683 --> 03:47.101
As our first project,

03:47.185 --> 03:52.065
I'd like to propose we do something about
Bridgeton's highly problematic mascot,

03:52.148 --> 03:53.608
the Scheming Gypsy.

03:53.691 --> 03:57.028
There's a statue of the Scheming Gypsy
on the south lawn.

03:57.111 --> 04:00.990
-A hawk lives in her bosom.
-Holy shit! That's what the mascot is?

04:01.074 --> 04:03.618
I thought it was Steven Van Zandt
from the E Street Band.

04:03.701 --> 04:06.079
I know! Can you believe that shit?

04:06.162 --> 04:08.706
If you believe it, I do,
because I believe women.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.583
-Okay. You're cute for trying.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.670
Cute? I don't know if I'd use that word,
but you already did, so…

04:13.753 --> 04:18.800
Sonya, I think Nick might be
goo-goo gaga for Jessi!

04:18.883 --> 04:20.677
You never know until you glow!

04:20.760 --> 04:23.179
This mascot is fucked.
How do we get rid of it?

04:23.263 --> 04:27.058
Uh, if you refer to your handout,
I actually have a 20-point plan.

04:27.141 --> 04:28.935
Guys, there's a wrestling meet tomorrow.

04:29.018 --> 04:30.353
We should do a protest there.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.438
-I think Jessi's super right.
-Yeah!

04:32.522 --> 04:34.649
We need to surprise attack those fuckers!

04:34.732 --> 04:37.610
Guys, a surprise attack
was not part of my plan,

04:37.694 --> 04:40.530
and again, I direct you to the handout.

04:40.655 --> 04:41.823
Then let's revise the plan!

04:41.906 --> 04:44.909
It's hard to revise the plan
when you haven't even heard the plan, Ali!

04:44.993 --> 04:46.536
Missy, do you want change or not?

04:46.619 --> 04:49.706
It's30 p.m.
Maury is getting his haircut.

04:49.789 --> 04:53.376
-Of course I want change, but I just--
-All right, let's take a vote.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.586
-Who wants to protest tomorrow?
-Yes!

04:55.670 --> 04:57.922
I protest this abandonment of procedure!

04:58.006 --> 05:00.466
Great, it's settled. Let's fuck shit up!

05:00.550 --> 05:02.468
Yeah, let's get balls deep, Glazer!

05:02.552 --> 05:04.053
-So deep!
-Yes, please!

05:04.137 --> 05:07.348
-Does no one want to hear my plan?

05:07.432 --> 05:10.101
You are crestfallen, please confirm.

05:10.184 --> 05:11.269
Confirmed.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.313
Hey, that was awesome. What do we do next?

05:13.396 --> 05:15.690
Well, I'm going over to Ali's tonight
to make posters.

05:15.773 --> 05:16.774
-You should come.
-Really?

05:16.858 --> 05:17.984
-Yeah.
-Yeah, great.

05:18.067 --> 05:20.445
I have this insane collection of markers

05:20.528 --> 05:23.197
because I once told my grandma
that I like to draw,

05:23.281 --> 05:26.993
and now she sends me a pack
every few months because she has dementia.

05:27.076 --> 05:27.910
Ok-- okay.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.580
I-- I don't know why I feel comfortable
sharing this with you.

05:30.663 --> 05:34.375
Anyway, one thing, Jessi, you should know
about me is that I have a lot of markers.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.086
Oh, here we glow.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.840
It's pulsating through my butt hole
and tingling up my spine.

05:40.923 --> 05:43.009
I know what it feels like, Walter!

05:43.092 --> 05:44.260
But the audience doesn't.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.304
-I'm trying to paint a picture here.
-Okay, sorry.

05:46.387 --> 05:50.350
All right, Nick, I'll see you
and your many, many markers tonight.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.935
Okay. I already know
I'm gonna forget the markers.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.396
Isn't she remarkable?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.440
Oh, hi. Uh, who are you?

05:57.523 --> 05:59.400
I'm Walter, your lovebug,

05:59.484 --> 06:02.320
and I'm here because
you are in love with Jessi.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.404
What? No, I'm not.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.114
I just like her more than anyone

06:05.198 --> 06:06.866
I've ever liked before ever. Shut up!

06:06.949 --> 06:10.411
Ooh, baby boy, if you didn't love her,
I wouldn't be here.

06:10.495 --> 06:11.412
What do you mean?

06:28.971 --> 06:31.808
-I--I think so?

06:34.477 --> 06:37.021
-There is!

06:41.692 --> 06:44.237
-Yeah!

06:54.705 --> 06:57.291
-Well, of course.

07:06.551 --> 07:07.385
Wait, what?

07:43.671 --> 07:46.174
Holy shit. I'm in love with Jessi.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.300
Shut up!

07:47.383 --> 07:50.303
So I said, "Father Joseph,
I get that you're married to God,

07:50.386 --> 07:54.015
but a good husband would never
let his partner wear that outfit."

07:54.098 --> 07:56.017
That's hilarious.

07:56.100 --> 08:00.688
Hey, Matt. Remember when Jay
consensually showed us his rock-hard dick?

08:00.771 --> 08:01.689
Yes, I remember.

08:01.772 --> 08:04.275
-I found that very moving.
-Will you shut up?

08:04.358 --> 08:07.737
So, I know we said no gifts
for our nine-month anniversary,

08:07.820 --> 08:10.114
but we both love stuff,
so I got you a thing.

08:10.198 --> 08:13.242
Oh, my God! A digital picture frame!

08:13.326 --> 08:16.621
It's stupid, but it cost a lot of money,
so that's cool.

08:16.704 --> 08:19.081
You know what's stupid but costs no money?

08:19.165 --> 08:20.666
Jay's dick. So that's cool.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.628
I actually got you something too.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.546
-It's a vest?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.298
Yeah, he wants you to look like Jay.

08:27.381 --> 08:30.134
First, it's the vest,
then a reverse circumcision.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.261
-We take a piece of skin--
-Not what's happening here!

08:32.345 --> 08:34.722
I just thought you'd look cute in it.
Put it on!

08:34.805 --> 08:38.267
Okay. Wow, you were right,
I actually do look pretty good in this.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.852
Yeah, pretty good.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.897
Aiden reminds me of Snoopy
when he put sunglasses on.

08:42.980 --> 08:46.192
Yeah, he looks cool, but that doesn't mean
you want to suck his D.

08:46.275 --> 08:50.321
Okay, mine's gonna say,

08:50.404 --> 08:51.239
-Ooh!

08:51.322 --> 08:53.824
She's funny. You didn't tell me
how funny she was, Nick.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.284
-I didn't?
-No, you did not!

08:55.368 --> 08:57.119
Oh, no, she's funny.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.748
She's just naturally funny,
while still being her dazzling self.

09:00.831 --> 09:05.127
Ooh, and herself, well,
it's as charming as a pig with shoes on.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.712
I don't-- I don't know what that is.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.297
-Never seen a pig with shoes on?
-No.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.382
-It's cute.
-It's charming.

09:09.465 --> 09:10.633
Ooh, whee!

09:10.716 --> 09:13.970
Jessi, did you know
Ali's got one of those modern toilets?

09:14.053 --> 09:16.639
It's a true pleasure to shit in her house.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.433
Connie? Man, it's so good to see you.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.477
-Sonya!
-What have you been up to?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.771
Oh, you know, this and that,

09:23.854 --> 09:25.439
-fucking your mom.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.234
-I wouldn't be surprised.
-Hold up, you here for Jessi?

09:28.317 --> 09:29.694
You bet your clean ass I am.

09:29.777 --> 09:32.530
Hot ham in a pair of wedges!

09:32.613 --> 09:34.615
Jessi's gonna be in love? Who is it?

09:34.699 --> 09:36.284
Don't tell me. Oh! Is it Judd?

09:36.367 --> 09:38.744
Oh, I don't know. I haven't met Judd yet.

09:38.828 --> 09:42.790
Oh, well, you gotta meet Judd,
and you got to use Ali's bathroom.

09:42.873 --> 09:45.167
I took a nice, hot shit up in it.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.587
Okay, I think I'm gonna write,
"Not my mascot."

09:47.670 --> 09:50.548
Okay, I love that. You have surprisingly
good handwriting for a boy.

09:50.631 --> 09:53.718
And if you ever let your bangs grow out,
I'll kill myself.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.469
Then, I guess I'll keep trimming my bangs.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.471
I guess then I won't throw myself
off a building.

09:57.555 --> 10:00.349
-Well, I guess not.
-Oh, my God, you two, get a room.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.184
-What? Stop it!
-Oh, my God, please!

10:02.268 --> 10:03.978
What room? What room would we even get?

10:04.061 --> 10:07.732
Their attraction to each other's
being called out by a peer!

10:07.815 --> 10:09.317
Please don't get too excited, Walter.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.486
You can't get too excited
when it comes to Jessi Glazer.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.239
She's as cute
as a squirrel in an acorn hat.

10:15.323 --> 10:18.826
Zip, zap, that ain't no rat.
That's a little squirrel in an acorn hat!

10:18.909 --> 10:20.328
Ah!

10:20.411 --> 10:22.038
She's cast a spell over us.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.789
I love my job.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.542
If you're just joining us,
welcome to wrestling,

10:26.626 --> 10:28.628
the gayest sport on the planet.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.671
Sports cannot be gay or straight.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.340
Hilarious.

10:32.423 --> 10:33.466
And false.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.801
First matchup,
we have Andrew Glouberman, who…

10:35.885 --> 10:36.719
Oh! Ow.

10:36.802 --> 10:40.014
Yep, got pinned immediately,
perfectly fulfilling all expectations.

10:40.097 --> 10:42.433
Hey, Andrew! I came to watch!

10:42.516 --> 10:43.726
You're such a loser!

10:43.809 --> 10:46.562
Yeah, but you know who wins? The crowd.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.191
That singlet is tight
and just right, baby.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.485
-Here comes our beloved mascot,

10:52.568 --> 10:55.112
-the Scheming Gypsy!

10:55.196 --> 10:59.659
Uh-oh, I'm looking into my crystal ball
to, like, see the future!

10:59.742 --> 11:03.496
Holy fucking shit,
this is wildly offensive.

11:03.579 --> 11:06.040
Gypsy! Gypsy! What do you see?

11:06.123 --> 11:09.919
-I see Charles Lu with a victory!
-Victory!

11:10.002 --> 11:13.214
And I see Jay dying alone
from choking on his brothers' gonads!

11:13.297 --> 11:14.757
-Gonads!

11:14.840 --> 11:16.592
People don't know we're protesting.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.636
They think we're watching
the wrestling match!

11:18.719 --> 11:20.680
Okay, guys, we have to do something.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.181
Oh, shit!

11:22.264 --> 11:26.102
Check it out, Matthew, my nuts are
all grubbled up on top of my shaft.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.853
-Uh… Oh. Um…

11:27.937 --> 11:31.607
Zip, zap, grubbled up sack!
You want to take Jay from the back.

11:31.691 --> 11:35.528
From the back, to the sack.
Jack his stack, eat his cum for a snack.

11:35.611 --> 11:36.904
Navarro!

11:38.698 --> 11:41.701
I don't like this mat!

11:41.784 --> 11:43.661
I don't like the mat.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.996
-You used my move!

11:46.080 --> 11:48.749
-That was amazing.
-You know any more wrestling magic?

11:48.833 --> 11:50.876
Fuck yeah, I know more wrestling magic.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.547
Okay, Charles Lu, feel free
to join me at Panera after the meet

11:54.630 --> 11:57.049
and bring your sense
of fucking wonderment.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.426
Sick. I love bread.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.220
Pop it, lock it, pick that pocket.

12:01.303 --> 12:04.014
Okay, that is enough.
We are going down there.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.809
No! This is supposed to be
a peaceful protest!

12:06.892 --> 12:09.186
-Fuck peaceful!
-Those two words don't go together.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.272
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

12:11.355 --> 12:13.983
-This racist mascot's got to go!

12:14.066 --> 12:17.278
Yes! Look around! Everyone is
so annoyed and confused. It's working!

12:17.361 --> 12:20.823
Oh, my God, Nick, we're being
the change we want to see in the gym.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.993
Sweet mercy, she's touching your arm.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.578
Isn't it exhilarating?

12:25.661 --> 12:27.663
Yeah, I can barely breathe.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.207
Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Fuck all you guys!

12:30.291 --> 12:32.334
Wow, look at you, all fired up.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.420
I like this side of you, Nicholas Birch.

12:34.503 --> 12:37.047
Yeah, "Nicholas."
Like a fucking man, not a kid.

12:37.131 --> 12:40.092
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
We're not getting rid of our mascot.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.802
I feel represented by the Gypsy!

12:41.886 --> 12:43.554
What? You're not even Romani!

12:43.637 --> 12:45.431
But I'm a schemer!

12:45.514 --> 12:47.349
I come from a long line of schemers!

12:47.433 --> 12:51.520
We scheme and scheme
until we can't schemes no more!

12:51.604 --> 12:53.481
-I'm with the feral boy!

12:53.564 --> 12:54.607
Some things are wrong.

12:54.690 --> 12:58.360
But if they're wrong for long enough,
they become tradition!

12:58.444 --> 13:01.030
But it's a bad tradition
that needs to be changed.

13:01.113 --> 13:04.241
What's next? You're gonna change
the Braves or the Chiefs,

13:04.325 --> 13:05.785
or my mom wiping me?

13:05.868 --> 13:07.453
Yeah. All those things.

13:07.536 --> 13:11.248
-But we're on a winning streak.
-Yeah! Can it wait till after the season?

13:11.332 --> 13:14.877
That's what I've been saying, DeVon!
This is a lengthy process!

13:14.960 --> 13:16.670
Missy! Whose side are you on?

13:16.754 --> 13:19.089
Jessi, we tried it your way and it failed.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.133
It didn't fail. This is how it starts!

13:21.217 --> 13:23.969
Ladies, ladies, there's no need to fight.

13:24.053 --> 13:27.223
The solution you seek
is these tasty cheeks.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.849
-Those cheeks!
-That ass!

13:28.933 --> 13:31.310
Hormone monsters! We got sass!

13:32.728 --> 13:33.771
Turn off the camera.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.483
-That was fuckin' wild!
-Oh, yeah. Right?

13:37.566 --> 13:40.027
Uh-oh. Caught in the act!
Dehydrating pineapple.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.822
-Ugh. So sorry, let's go to my room.
-Wait, hold on.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.825
-I would like to meet her.
-Oh, my God.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.369
-Hey, Mr. Glazer. I'm Ali.
-We're just passing through.

13:48.452 --> 13:50.871
We're trying to do big things,
like overturn a mascot!

13:50.955 --> 13:52.581
Well, if you need some sustenance,

13:52.665 --> 13:54.792
here's a bag
of Daddy Greg's pineapple chews.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.794
Ew, they look like
dried-up little butt holes.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.838
I wish my butt tasted this sweet!

13:58.921 --> 14:01.048
Dad! Oh, he's so embarrassing.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.508
My dad's embarrassing, too.

14:02.591 --> 14:04.051
He wears True Religion jeans.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.261
He sounds cool.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.471
-Is he looking for male friends?
-Bye, Dad!

14:07.555 --> 14:10.850
Hey, Jessi! You have my info, right?
To pass along to Ali's dad?

14:10.933 --> 14:13.394
Hey, guys,
I need to make weight for wrestling,

14:13.477 --> 14:16.355
and I have a nine-pound parasite
living in my guts.

14:16.438 --> 14:17.523
But here's the thing!

14:17.606 --> 14:19.692
We've become very dear friends,

14:19.775 --> 14:23.779
so I want him out of my body
but not out of my life.

14:23.863 --> 14:24.738
Any suggestions?

14:24.822 --> 14:27.157
What in sweet fucking Joseph
is wrong with him?

14:27.241 --> 14:29.618
Nothing!
He just doesn't want to lose a friend.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.912
Jay is, to me, a very special person.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.664
Why do you like him so much?

14:33.747 --> 14:37.167
Because!
He's uninhibited, unwashed, uncut,

14:37.251 --> 14:39.712
and he's got that funk
to make your junk spunk.

14:39.795 --> 14:43.257
But Aiden…
He's smart, he's kind, he likes me.

14:43.340 --> 14:46.927
Well, of recent,
Aiden gives you mushy pee-pee.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.304
You need to ditch him.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.139
Oh, stop it.
I'm not breaking up with Aiden.

14:50.222 --> 14:54.476
You never take any of my advice,
and I have good ideas. I'm not dumb.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.854
-Oh, Maury--
-No! I don't want to talk right now.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.355
I'm going for a run.

14:59.064 --> 15:02.735
Charles Lu, prepare to have
your dick blown off your body

15:02.818 --> 15:05.654
by the Sorcerers of the Square Table.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.197
Smoke bomb!

15:08.282 --> 15:09.199
Hm-hmm!

15:16.665 --> 15:17.666
And gone!

15:18.584 --> 15:19.460
Ta-da!

15:19.543 --> 15:20.544
Whoa.

15:20.628 --> 15:21.587
Fire.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.464
Your friend is so cool, Jay.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.007
Yeah, no shit, Todd!

15:25.090 --> 15:29.803
He's only the number-one kid in our grade,
and he's hanging out with me!

15:29.887 --> 15:34.433
Listen, sweetie, I am carbo-loading
this juicy, wide roundy.

15:34.516 --> 15:37.478
So why don't you get me
one of everything on the menu?

15:37.561 --> 15:41.732
That's right, Andy,
feed your curves that they may expand.

15:41.815 --> 15:44.526
Sir, I'm not sure
that fat ass can get any fatter,

15:44.610 --> 15:46.654
but I'm willing
to go on the journey with you.

15:46.737 --> 15:49.865
-Well, then, away we go!

15:50.950 --> 15:53.452
So, you and Samira.
Didn't see that coming.

15:53.535 --> 15:56.622
I know. I know.
I'm loud, she's super quiet,

15:56.705 --> 15:58.415
but Samira's actually really deep.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.834
-Really?
-And she looks like an old colonial ghost.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.920
-And that makes me horny.
-I get that. I see that.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.839
-What about you? Who do you like?
-Oh, God, no, I can't.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.925
-I shared, you share!
-Ugh!

16:08.008 --> 16:10.511
Let's tell her about Judd,
how you stole his shirt

16:10.594 --> 16:12.888
and how you floss your vagine-gine
with it every night.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.306
-No, thank you!
-Come on!

16:14.390 --> 16:16.100
We're all girlfriends here, right?

16:16.183 --> 16:18.394
We like to pinch each other's nipples.
Come on, tell her!

16:18.477 --> 16:21.814
Okay. You know Nick's brother, Judd?
Well, I'm kind of into him…

16:21.897 --> 16:23.691
-I know!

16:23.774 --> 16:25.526
-He is so hot!
-Right?

16:25.609 --> 16:27.403
Well, in a weird, serial-killer kinda way.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.864
Okay, so the other day,
I stole this from his house.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.242
-You're a little psycho, Jessi!
-Am I?

16:33.325 --> 16:35.369
I bet you floss your snatch with it
every night.

16:35.452 --> 16:36.328
She knows!

16:36.412 --> 16:37.913
Okay, I only did it once!

16:37.997 --> 16:41.041
I mean, God, to be honest,
I actually thought you liked Nick.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.960
-Really?
-You guys have, like, chemistry.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.671
-We do?
-Química, as they say in español.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.715
I mean, we've always just been friends.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.883
In a couple years,
Nick might look just like Judd.

16:49.967 --> 16:50.801
What's that now?

16:50.884 --> 16:53.137
Wow, I never even thought
about that point of view.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.346
Buy short, sell tall.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.432
Sonya, is that why you're here?

16:56.515 --> 16:58.892
Jessi and Nick? Are they Ross and Rachel?

16:58.976 --> 17:01.270
You know, I didn't watch Friends.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.397
I guess I was too busy

17:03.480 --> 17:04.440
fucking your mom.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.526
Okay, you know what? My mom has passed.
So why don't you shut the fuck up?

17:07.609 --> 17:09.737
-Hey, Missy just texted us.

17:09.820 --> 17:13.282
"Good news. I got us a meeting
with the school board in six months"?

17:13.365 --> 17:15.743
Fuck that shit!
We have to do something right now!

17:15.826 --> 17:17.828
-Let's go knock down that racist statue!
-Yes!

17:17.911 --> 17:20.372
I'm all hopped up
on your dad's pineapple butt holes.

17:20.456 --> 17:21.582
-Oh, my God, Ali!
-Sorry!

17:21.665 --> 17:23.625
-Whatever. Let's go! We're going!
-Let's go!

17:24.209 --> 17:26.545
Guys, I really think
I have momentum with Jessi.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.422
All righty! The big mo!

17:28.505 --> 17:31.008
You should have heard
the way she said his name.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.509
"Nicholas Birch."

17:32.593 --> 17:35.054
Yeah, she likes the taste
of my name in her mouth.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.890
Bickolas Snirch. Yum, yum, yum.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.976
Nick, what you need now
is a grand gesture!

17:41.060 --> 17:43.896
When I liked a girl, I'd write her a song,

17:43.979 --> 17:47.608
or buy her a pair of gloves
that go all the way up to her armpits.

17:48.192 --> 17:51.528
And then smell the gloves while she slept.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.323
I don't know,
a grand gesture seems kind of risky.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.575
But think of all you have to gain.

17:56.658 --> 17:59.703
Okay, I've done some quick oil paintings
projecting your future.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.246
Jessi at Columbia.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.706
She worked hard, good for her.

18:02.790 --> 18:07.044
You at NYU, probably
on some kind of comedy scholarship.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.170
I learn differently.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.172
You'll meet halfway in Times Square,

18:10.255 --> 18:13.675
get married,
make a bunch of babies in Miami.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.720
Wow! That's exactly as I pictured it too.

18:16.804 --> 18:17.721
I'm in, Walter.

18:17.805 --> 18:21.391
Let's make a grand gesture
for the heart of Jessi Glazer.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.727
Well said, Bicholas Snirch.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.230
Hey, that's my line.
All right, I'm in the mix.

18:29.983 --> 18:32.361
-Jeez, this thing's really a statue, huh?

18:32.444 --> 18:34.988
Do you have chains
and a pickup truck, by any chance?

18:35.072 --> 18:36.615
-There's a Lime scooter over there.
-Ooh!

18:36.698 --> 18:39.201
What if we throw the scooter
as hard as we can at the statue?

18:39.284 --> 18:40.702
Oh, my God, great idea.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.455
-We're gonna kill this statue.
-I feel crazy right now, Jessi!

18:43.539 --> 18:45.499
-I do too!
-I think it's all the fucking pineapple.

18:45.582 --> 18:47.334
-It's so heavy.

18:47.417 --> 18:51.213
-Did you just fart?
-No! It--it was the statue.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.216
We better knock that bitch over
before she shits on the ground.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.300
Pfft! Okay.

18:56.426 --> 18:59.429
-We suck!
-Oh, we're so bad. Um…

18:59.513 --> 19:02.307
-The crystal ball looks loose.
-Should we fucking kick it?

19:02.391 --> 19:04.726
Let me hold your shoulder.
I'll fuckin' nail it with my heel.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.313
-I'm sorry! I think it's the pineapple.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.232
Okay, enough of this bullshit!

19:11.900 --> 19:14.236
You have freed me from my curse.

19:14.319 --> 19:17.823
-I'm a man again. Thank you.
-Wait, he's still a hawk, right?

19:17.906 --> 19:20.409
Yeah, but don't tell him,
he seems so happy.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.411
-Freeze there, fuckos!
-Oh, shit!

19:22.494 --> 19:24.830
You're under arrest
for destruction of property

19:24.913 --> 19:26.623
here, there, over there,
actually right here.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.876
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.337
Jesus Christ. That smells sweet.

19:32.421 --> 19:33.881
-On my aunt's grave

19:33.964 --> 19:35.465
who I loved like a mother,

19:35.549 --> 19:37.801
those girls' farts
smell like a piña colada.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.012
-It's the pineapple!

19:42.556 --> 19:44.641
Um, if you're just gonna be
on your phone all night,

19:44.725 --> 19:45.934
then we don't have to hang out.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.853
Whoa, I was just seeing what time it was.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.772
-Is something wrong?
-No! Why are you always asking me that?

19:50.856 --> 19:53.483
Um, I have literally
never asked you that before.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.945
I guess I just feel like you're always
up my ass about everything.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.906
Matt, I'm-- I'm confused.
What's your game here?

19:58.989 --> 20:02.910
And by the way, why would you put
that hideous photo of me in there?

20:02.993 --> 20:05.329
-Is that what you think I look like?
-What is your problem?

20:05.412 --> 20:07.206
-You're being kinda psycho.
-Are you…

20:07.289 --> 20:09.791
I'm sorry, are you breaking up with me?

20:09.875 --> 20:12.085
Oh, I see what you're doing.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.213
You're Inceptioning him to dump you.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.255
-Genius!

20:15.339 --> 20:17.549
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about, Matthew.

20:17.633 --> 20:21.053
Well, obviously you don't want to be
with me if you think I'm such a psycho!

20:21.136 --> 20:24.181
Wait a minute. Are you trying
to get me to break up with you?

20:24.264 --> 20:26.225
What? What does that even mean?

20:26.308 --> 20:28.352
Oh, my God, you are.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.062
You are such a fucking coward.

20:30.145 --> 20:33.982
If I'm a fucking coward,
maybe you should just continue dumping me.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.443
You're right in the middle of it,
you're almost done!

20:36.526 --> 20:38.612
No, no, no. No, no. You are dumping me.

20:38.695 --> 20:42.282
That's so funny,
because it feels like you're dumping me!

20:42.366 --> 20:44.534
You know what?
Screw this, I'm out of here.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.078
And for the record, you dumped me.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.080
You just weren't brave enough
to actually do it.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.123
-Uh-oh.
-Which, after all this time,

20:50.207 --> 20:51.833
is really fucked up.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.252
-Ugh.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.586
I'm such a dick.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.214
Sure, you're sad. I'm sad too!

20:57.297 --> 20:58.131
But not really.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.385
Not even at all,
because now you can go after Jay.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.844
Huh. I guess I can.

21:02.928 --> 21:06.223
Hey, hey! Jay's hole!
Lick his ass and stroke his pole.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.517
Ow, ow, ow, ow. Oh, ooh, it's tearing.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.727
That was dope. Those magic guys are cool.

21:10.811 --> 21:14.189
And what's really cool is
they're, like, always available.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.775
You can hit them up
on their beepers day and night.

21:16.858 --> 21:19.569
Tight.
Hey, you know any more wrestling magic?

21:19.653 --> 21:20.779
Hell, yeah, I do!

21:20.862 --> 21:22.656
Get in here, Charles Lu!

21:28.245 --> 21:29.871
Oh.

21:29.955 --> 21:30.831
Whoa!

21:30.914 --> 21:32.207
Later, dude.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.669
Oh, shit, my dick is levitating!

21:35.752 --> 21:38.255
Oh, Maury, I don't feel so good.

21:38.338 --> 21:42.718
Yeah, no shit. You just powered down,
like, six clam chowder bread bowls.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.762
I think I'm gonna shit
my goddamned singlet. Ah!

21:45.846 --> 21:48.932
Okay. Hi. What's the code
for the bathroom, good sir?

21:49.016 --> 21:52.811
-Six-seven-three-nine-oh-eight-eight…
-What? Now what? Six… One more time.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.604
-Eight…
-What the fuck? One more time!

21:54.688 --> 21:56.481
-Six, seven…
-Fuck you. Fuck your door.

21:56.565 --> 21:59.568
Oh, no, lady.
You're not gonna wanna be here for this.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.528
-My pocketbook!
-It's fine!

22:01.611 --> 22:03.655
I'm not sure I'm gonna make it, Maury.

22:03.739 --> 22:07.200
It's gonna be one of those where
you're shitting as you're sitting down.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.118
One of those?

22:08.201 --> 22:10.287
My God, my singlet, I can't get it off.

22:10.370 --> 22:12.289
Rip that thing from bow to stern!

22:12.372 --> 22:13.832
Okay, good, nude as a baby!

22:13.915 --> 22:15.125
-Oh…

22:15.208 --> 22:16.209
Buzzer beater!

22:16.293 --> 22:20.088
You're shitting as you're sitting down.
Yes, okay. Yeah, I've done that.

22:20.172 --> 22:24.634
All right, girls, after all the rigmarole,
we're letting ya off with a warning.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.846
But for all that's good and holy,
lay off the pineapple.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.848
We're gonna have to fumigate
our squad car.

22:29.931 --> 22:30.766
Yes, sir.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.934
I'm sorry we farted
and broke a crystal ball.

22:34.394 --> 22:36.063
Well, they don't seem sorry at all,
do they?

22:36.146 --> 22:39.524
It's all giggles and bullshit
till someone dies.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.693
Well, obviously you're grounded.

22:41.777 --> 22:44.112
I know. But it was totally worth it.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.741
Ali is a blast.
You guys should rob a bank together.

22:47.824 --> 22:50.911
It's just so nice to have a new friend
that makes me feel good

22:50.994 --> 22:53.288
and doesn't, like,
jack off in front of me.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.750
Speaking of, is that Andrew
wearin' a bread bowl on his butt?

22:56.833 --> 23:00.295
Hey, Jessi!
You're probably asking yourself,

23:00.379 --> 23:03.965
"Why is Andrew wearing
a rustic loaf over his sweet, fat can?"

23:04.049 --> 23:07.594
You see… Hey! No, no, no, no, wait!
Can I get a ride home?

23:07.677 --> 23:09.971
Oh, my underbreads!

23:12.057 --> 23:12.974
What the…

23:13.642 --> 23:14.476
-Hey!
-Hey!

23:14.559 --> 23:15.727
-Hi!
-Hey, Nick.

23:15.811 --> 23:18.021
-Um…
-What are you doing outside of my house?

23:18.105 --> 23:19.981
-I, uh…
-I'll give you five minutes, Jess,

23:20.065 --> 23:22.067
but only because
Nick has an acoustic guitar.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.236
You do have an acoustic guitar. How come?

23:24.319 --> 23:25.278
Oh, um…

23:25.362 --> 23:28.365
Uh, because there's something
I need to tell you.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.033
You got this, Nicholas.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.451
You got the look.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.078
Jessi…

23:59.813 --> 24:01.148
Connie, what do I do?

24:01.231 --> 24:04.484
Baby, I think you have to let him finish.
Maybe at the end, it's a joke.

24:10.323 --> 24:12.742
In case it wasn't clear,
what I'm saying is,

24:12.826 --> 24:13.869
I love you.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.246
I'm in love with you, Jessi Glazer.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.623
Oh, my God, I don't know what to say.

24:18.707 --> 24:21.293
Sonya, where's the glow, darling?

24:21.376 --> 24:22.878
Oh… Walter.

24:22.961 --> 24:25.505
Nick, you don't… You don't love me.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.967
What? Of course I do.
Like, it's so cheesy but, like,

24:29.050 --> 24:30.844
with all, like, my heart and soul.

24:30.927 --> 24:34.973
Like, I want to, like, make babies
with you on a balcony in Miami.

24:35.056 --> 24:36.933
-Like, not now, but one day.
-What?

24:37.017 --> 24:40.061
Oh, no, Nicky,
no, no, no, no, no, no, Nicky, no. Stop.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.397
Can you just…
Can you say something back now?

24:42.481 --> 24:45.358
I'm so sorry. I just don't think
I feel the same way about you.

24:46.693 --> 24:50.363
-Cool, uh, cool. I see. That's, uh…
-I'm so sorry.

24:50.447 --> 24:53.241
No, that's good, uh,
good information to have.

24:54.242 --> 24:55.494
Walter, what do I do?

24:55.577 --> 24:58.121
Uh… I-- I don't know. This always works.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.831
Tell her you love her!

24:59.915 --> 25:02.834
-Okay, I feel like I should go?
-Yeah, me too.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.754
So I think I'll just…
I'm gonna go for a run.

25:05.837 --> 25:06.796
-Ow!

25:06.880 --> 25:08.173
Oh! Dear Lord!

25:08.798 --> 25:10.800
Woof! That was rough.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.636
Why did Nick have to do that?

25:12.719 --> 25:13.929
And then he fell!

25:14.012 --> 25:15.514
Scraped his little hands.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.183
You know he's not gonna
clean the pebbles out of those hands.

25:18.266 --> 25:20.268
-Oh, God, he's back.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.603
Nick, I…

25:21.686 --> 25:22.646
-Ali!
-Hey!

25:22.729 --> 25:23.855
Aren't you grounded?

25:23.939 --> 25:26.358
Well, yeah, but I--
I just wanted to let you know

25:26.441 --> 25:29.027
that my dad is super into
hanging out with your dad.

25:29.110 --> 25:30.362
-Really?
-No!

25:30.445 --> 25:33.573
I snuck out to tell you that you're
a fucking bad-ass, Jessi Glazer!

25:33.657 --> 25:36.868
Me? You're the one
who smashed a crystal ball with a rock!

25:36.952 --> 25:38.370
You farted at cops!

25:38.453 --> 25:39.663
Well, we both did that.

25:39.746 --> 25:41.206
We really did, didn't we?

25:41.289 --> 25:42.207
Hell yeah.

25:42.290 --> 25:45.085
All right, well, I gotta get back
before my dad realizes

25:45.168 --> 25:47.754
the lump in my bed is
a pile of True Religion jeans.

25:47.837 --> 25:48.672
Love you!

25:48.755 --> 25:49.839
Love you!

25:49.923 --> 25:52.634
That girl is so cool, right?

25:52.717 --> 25:54.636
She's the fucking coolest.
