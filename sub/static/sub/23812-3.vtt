First, you need to know...

Brushing someone else's teeth

01:06.634 --> 01:08.567
is my second favorite
Armor Day tradition.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.503
I'll brush yours, Warwick.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.372

seem weird to you,

01:26.487 --> 01:28.921

01:29.023 --> 01:30.889
On Armor Day,
we celebrate the story

01:30.991 --> 01:33.759
of the creation
of the Armor of Astoria.

01:33.861 --> 01:37.796

02:01.322 --> 02:03.622
- ...the first king of Astoria
gathered his wizards

02:03.724 --> 02:05.491
because he knew evil forces

02:05.593 --> 02:07.292
would one day
descend upon Astoria.

02:07.394 --> 02:10.362
- Pause.
Are there scary parts?

02:10.464 --> 02:11.363
- Yes.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.133
- Okay, I just
need some warning.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.070
- The first king
commanded his wizards

02:18.172 --> 02:20.806
to make an enchanted suit
of armor.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.274
The wizards' powerful magic

02:22.376 --> 02:25.277
made whoever wore the armor
indestructible.

02:25.379 --> 02:28.113
Hogancross, the wisest wizard,
said the armor was...

02:28.215 --> 02:29.548
(imitates Hogancross)
...shinier than

- CIARRA: But as the king and
his wizards were celebrating,

the castle to steal the armor.

the hands of evil,

Hogancross cast a powerful
spell with his staff.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.149
- [poof]

03:04.251 --> 03:06.685
- CIARRA: The armor was
banished to an unknown place,

03:06.787 --> 03:08.820
where it remains to this day.

03:08.923 --> 03:10.789
Armor Day celebrates
the hope that one day,

03:10.891 --> 03:13.992
we'll find the armor and
use it to keep Astoria safe.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.961
- Aw, man, this is terrible.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.931
- What are you talking about?
Armor Day is the best day ever.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.166
- Yeah, but if I don't know
all the Armor Day customs,

I don't belong in knight school.

festivities are starting.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.653
The safest thing is for you

03:41.755 --> 03:43.855
to hide in here for the day
and lay low.

beautiful, like...

- Those are almost
impossible to find.

It'd mean a lot more

21:11.938 --> 21:13.771
if you could tell me that
as the princess.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.973
- Don't ruin this.

21:16.075 --> 21:18.109
- Well, students,
it's getting late

21:18.211 --> 21:21.178
for an 1,000-year-old man
to be up.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.119

21:28.221 --> 21:29.954
- [poof]

21:30.056 --> 21:31.122
- And he's back.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.659
I missed you.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.127
- Hold that.

21:37.263 --> 21:42.667
I so loved your show.
I must see it one more time.

21:42.769 --> 21:46.237
- Oh my goblin!
- Prudy, it's happening again!

21:48.508 --> 21:50.374
- Five, six, seven, eight!

21:50.476 --> 21:52.009
