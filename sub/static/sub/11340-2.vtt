WEBVTT

00:00.762 --> 00:02.029
Guess who I went
to second base with.

00:02.929 --> 00:04.512
- Who, Cy?
- Lyla Smith.

00:04.596 --> 00:05.513
Bull!

00:05.598 --> 00:06.848
Get back here!

00:06.933 --> 00:08.350
Why don't you
believe me?

00:08.434 --> 00:10.535
Because you lie!

00:12.021 --> 00:14.105
I grew up normal,

00:14.156 --> 00:16.056
in a normal house,

00:16.125 --> 00:18.276
the size of a castle.

00:19.595 --> 00:22.631
I played sports...

00:22.698 --> 00:24.749
sang in the choir,

00:24.817 --> 00:27.869
for the President
of the United States...

00:27.954 --> 00:32.674
And celebrated my birthdays
with 4-story cakes,

00:32.758 --> 00:36.711
flown straight from Paris.

00:36.796 --> 00:40.882
My brother and I
played kickball over there.

00:43.536 --> 00:47.055
And--and here is where we
would hide from the police

00:47.123 --> 00:51.192
after stealing magic
potions from the toy store.

00:52.662 --> 00:54.779
I don't know why
they wouldn't believe me

00:54.847 --> 00:59.367
when I told them we were gonna
make things with it.

00:59.435 --> 01:01.336
I still build things now.

01:01.404 --> 01:05.022
I--I took apart
a 1961 DeSoto

01:05.074 --> 01:08.526
and built a generator
from scratch.

01:08.577 --> 01:10.178
It's so powerful,

01:10.246 --> 01:13.698
it could light
a Springsteen concert.

01:13.749 --> 01:17.419
But for now,
it just lights my room.

01:25.227 --> 01:28.930
What are you--
what are you doing?

01:28.998 --> 01:30.982
I don't understand.

01:31.050 --> 01:33.935
I'll do anything.
Please, don't hurt me.

01:34.020 --> 01:36.888
Shh, shh...

01:36.939 --> 01:39.057
Why would I hurt you?

01:41.861 --> 01:43.778
No, no, no, no,
no, no!

01:45.898 --> 01:47.499
So you finished the course?

01:47.566 --> 01:49.400
Mm-hmm. And completed
my case rotation.

01:49.452 --> 01:51.720
Hotch says he's never
seen a rookie profiler

01:51.787 --> 01:53.905
analyze and write up
cases as well as you.

01:53.956 --> 01:55.239
He said that?

01:55.291 --> 01:56.741
Yeah. Well, after
all the cases you presented

01:56.792 --> 01:58.910
over the years,
I'm not surprised.

01:58.961 --> 02:01.513
Hey, where have you been?
I wanted to do brunch this weekend.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.348
I had to deal with some stuff
with my mom.

02:03.415 --> 02:04.516
Have you seen Garcia?

02:04.583 --> 02:07.552
Uh, she's with Rossi.

02:07.603 --> 02:10.020
He hates me.

02:10.089 --> 02:12.357
Mm, he was just busy.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.275
Let it go.

02:15.811 --> 02:17.812
Ok, you can be honest.
I can take it.

02:17.897 --> 02:19.531
Ok. I prefer my pasta
al dente,

02:19.598 --> 02:21.199
and the pancetta
was a little weird.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.817
Oh. That's 'cause
it's tofu.

02:22.902 --> 02:25.870
Tofu? I give you my recipe
and you do an improv?

02:25.938 --> 02:28.540
No, no, I followed it down to
the micron, aside from the pig.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.775
Look, master of
all things Italian,

02:30.826 --> 02:33.545
I am having a Fellini festival
at my house this weekend

02:33.612 --> 02:36.498
and I must serve
the beautiful food

02:36.582 --> 02:37.916
of his country.

02:37.967 --> 02:41.836
Maybe you should show a Disney
film and stick with burgers.

02:41.921 --> 02:43.922
You know, Rossi, you could always
give Penelope a cooking lesson.

02:43.973 --> 02:46.725
Oh, my gosh,
that would be amazing.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.059
That would be like--

02:48.127 --> 02:51.262
that would be like
the Iron Chef meets the BAU.

02:51.313 --> 02:52.731
And we could do it
at your house.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.065
I don't have a house,

02:54.133 --> 02:55.400
I have a mansion.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.685
All right,
let's get started.

02:57.770 --> 02:59.320
Oh.

03:01.690 --> 03:03.775
All right, mes amis.

03:03.826 --> 03:07.162
You are jetting
to Durant, Oklahoma,

03:07.246 --> 03:09.581
because in the last 3 days,

03:09.648 --> 03:11.616
two women
have been found dead

03:11.667 --> 03:13.368
after being sexually
tortured

03:13.452 --> 03:17.155
and then blinded with
a sulfuric acid solution.

03:17.206 --> 03:19.190
Abby Elcott
is our first victim.

03:19.258 --> 03:20.625
19-year-old art student.

03:20.676 --> 03:23.111
She was headed to campus
for an advanced drawing class.

03:23.179 --> 03:24.879
She'd been missing
for two days.

03:24.947 --> 03:29.134
Same goes for our second victim,
Beth Westerly, 17.

03:29.185 --> 03:31.052
She had just finished
her coffee shop shift

03:31.137 --> 03:33.855
and was on her way
to a bar method class.

03:33.939 --> 03:35.473
Both low-risk victims.

03:35.524 --> 03:37.108
And physically similar.

03:37.176 --> 03:39.110
How close are
the two abduction sites?

03:39.178 --> 03:41.112
5 miles apart
at bus stops.

03:41.180 --> 03:43.181
Abby's cell
was found near one,

03:43.232 --> 03:44.816
Beth's scarf
near the other.

03:44.867 --> 03:46.034
Where are the dump sites?

03:46.118 --> 03:47.852
One in an alley,
the other in a field.

03:47.903 --> 03:49.370
So he stapled
their eyes open,

03:49.455 --> 03:51.322
then he blinded them.

03:51.373 --> 03:53.223
It's about power and control.

03:53.248 --> 03:54.848
Maybe he didn't want them
to watch while he hurt them.

03:54.877 --> 03:56.544
Or it could be about shame.

03:56.629 --> 03:58.379
Perhaps the unsub
is disfigured himself.

03:58.464 --> 04:01.132
Blinding the victims leaves them
helpless, lost, totally dependent.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.469
It may be a manifestation of how
he sees himself in this world.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.871
It is a form of enucleation,
just without the scalpel.

04:06.922 --> 04:10.208
His face is the last they see
before darkness.

04:10.259 --> 04:11.893
Garcia, come up with
a list of jobs

04:11.977 --> 04:14.045
that would give the unsub
access to sulfuric acid.

04:14.096 --> 04:16.180
The rest of us,
wheels up in 30 minutes.

04:18.233 --> 04:22.537
And this is where
my brother lives now.

04:23.906 --> 04:26.274
There you are, Cy.

04:26.358 --> 04:28.159
I got you clothes.

04:28.227 --> 04:31.162
Bought you some
shampoo and toothpaste.

04:31.230 --> 04:34.666
See? We're the perfect
American story.

04:34.733 --> 04:37.168
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ok. Turn
that thing off, come on in.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.419
Come on.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.374
Every story has a beginning.

04:43.425 --> 04:45.877
But the part I like best

04:45.928 --> 04:47.679
is the end.

But if it is a fact,

05:32.443 --> 05:33.576
Mark Twain.

05:33.644 --> 05:35.028
Victimology
is very similar.

05:35.112 --> 05:37.280
Blond-haired,
blue-eyed teenage girls.

05:37.331 --> 05:39.032
We believe
they were each abducted

05:39.116 --> 05:40.667
near public
transportation stops.

05:40.751 --> 05:42.368
When was this photo
taken?

05:42.453 --> 05:44.454
Beth was caught on a bank
surveillance camera

05:44.505 --> 05:45.872
3 hours before she disappeared.

05:45.956 --> 05:47.256
That's a recent photo of Abby.

05:47.324 --> 05:49.676
So she wasn't found
in the same clothes

05:49.760 --> 05:51.210
she was abducted in.

05:51.295 --> 05:53.019
Maybe he changed them
because hers were burned

05:53.044 --> 05:54.543
by the sulfuric acid.

05:54.598 --> 05:57.767
It's possible. Sulfuric acid
can turn human flesh into soap.

05:57.834 --> 06:00.269
Garcia, any recent similar
cases in the surrounding area?

06:00.337 --> 06:02.005
Actually, yes.
Two months ago

06:02.072 --> 06:04.006
a prostitute and a runaway
were both found

06:04.058 --> 06:06.726
raped and killed and they
had stab wounds to their eyes.

06:06.794 --> 06:09.646
So maybe he practiced
on high-risk victims first.

06:09.697 --> 06:12.065
And then advanced
to chemical enucleation.

06:12.149 --> 06:13.683
Isn't that a rare
paraphilia?

06:13.734 --> 06:16.653
Well, the chemical part is.
It would exacerbate the pain.

06:16.704 --> 06:19.522
Like Ed Kemper, he's probably
practicing on surrogates

06:19.573 --> 06:22.825
before going after
the real object of his rage.

06:22.876 --> 06:24.327
Dave, you and I will
talk to the parents.

06:24.378 --> 06:26.245
Morgan and Prentiss,
go to the disposal sites.

06:26.330 --> 06:28.197
JJ, you and Reid
to the abduction sites.

06:34.304 --> 06:36.422
So Beth
got off the bus here

06:36.507 --> 06:38.341
and headed northwest
toward class.

06:38.392 --> 06:40.176
It's amazing no one
witnessed her abduction.

06:40.227 --> 06:42.545
Emily was buried 6 feet under
and wound up in Paris,

06:42.596 --> 06:44.380
so I guess anything's
possible, right?

06:44.431 --> 06:46.182
So that is what this is about.

06:46.233 --> 06:47.817
Maybe our unsub's
a little bit like Bundy.

06:47.884 --> 06:50.036
He feigns injury in order
to get her to help him.

06:50.104 --> 06:51.554
Look, Spence, if you want
to talk about this--

06:51.605 --> 06:53.556
maybe he tried other tactics, like,
"Wow, you're really pretty.

06:53.607 --> 06:55.108
"You should be a model.
I can take your photo.

06:55.192 --> 06:56.859
I'll take that as a no.

06:56.910 --> 06:58.561
Either one
would disarm her.

06:58.612 --> 07:00.446
Charm is quite the killer.

07:00.531 --> 07:02.165
So are tears.
Whatever his ruse was,

07:02.232 --> 07:04.450
the unsub mostly likely used it
to get her into his vehicle.

07:04.535 --> 07:08.571
Well, if Abby was last seen
at a bus stop a few miles away,

07:08.622 --> 07:10.523
then he definitely has
a means of transportation.

07:10.591 --> 07:12.809
Hopefully the disposal site
will tell us more.

07:15.078 --> 07:17.013
So what do you have,
Detective Bonner?

07:17.080 --> 07:20.750
Beth's body was found
over there.

07:20.801 --> 07:22.518
You smell the urine?

07:22.586 --> 07:25.354
I thought that
was air freshener.

07:25.422 --> 07:27.507
There's drugstore food
everywhere.

07:27.574 --> 07:28.808
It's a homeless
corridor.

07:28.892 --> 07:32.195
Abby was found
in a shantytown as well.

07:32.262 --> 07:35.198
So, our unsub
hunts and travels

07:35.265 --> 07:36.816
through the areas unnoticed,

07:36.900 --> 07:38.701
blending in
with his surroundings.

07:38.769 --> 07:40.987
This guy's either
homeless or appears to be.

07:41.071 --> 07:42.205
He most likely
has a car,

07:42.272 --> 07:44.157
to get them from
the abduction site to here.

07:44.241 --> 07:46.209
Just because you're homeless
doesn't mean you're carless.

07:46.276 --> 07:49.212
It could explain why he chose
high-risk victims at first.

07:49.279 --> 07:51.414
They were all around him.

07:54.284 --> 07:56.886
He had her for two days?

07:56.953 --> 07:59.889
I can't even imagine
what she went through.

07:59.956 --> 08:01.507
Why did he blind her?

08:01.592 --> 08:03.309
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

08:03.393 --> 08:05.311
I know this is difficult,

08:05.395 --> 08:08.314
but I need you to look at the
clothes that Abby was wearing

08:08.398 --> 08:10.433
when we found her.

08:11.985 --> 08:13.569
Do you recognize them?

08:13.637 --> 08:16.572
Do you find anything odd

08:16.640 --> 08:18.241
about Beth's clothing?

08:21.111 --> 08:23.196
They're not Abby's.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.031
You sure?

08:25.115 --> 08:26.949
I saw her that morning.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.202
She had on a brown
and pink sweater.

08:29.286 --> 08:31.537
Beth wouldn't wear
denim shorts.

08:31.622 --> 08:33.923
They aren't her style.

08:33.990 --> 08:36.826
You're sure?

08:36.876 --> 08:38.344
In addition to the blinding,

08:38.428 --> 08:40.679
taking their clothes further
robs them of their identity.

08:40.764 --> 08:42.597
He's either keeping
their garments as souvenirs

08:42.666 --> 08:45.785
or re-dressing the victims
as a forensic countermeasure.

08:45.853 --> 08:48.521
Dressing them in these outfits
could be part of the fantasy.

08:48.605 --> 08:51.023
Where do homeless people
get their clothes?

08:51.108 --> 08:55.061
Churches, thrift stores.
We need to rule everything out.

08:55.145 --> 08:57.480
Whooo!
I'm a plane! I'm a plane!

08:57.531 --> 09:01.517
You are now entering
Dallas International Airport.

09:01.568 --> 09:04.320
Please hold on to your
flotation device

09:04.371 --> 09:06.088
and fasten your seatbelts!

09:06.156 --> 09:07.690
Cy, your stuff is right there.

09:07.741 --> 09:10.025
Oh, minty fresh.
I like minty fresh.

09:10.077 --> 09:11.990
We keep buying you
toothbrushes, but you

09:12.015 --> 09:13.129
clearly aren't using them.

09:13.130 --> 09:15.248
Instead of crashing here
every now and again,

09:15.332 --> 09:16.482
why don't you just move in?

09:16.550 --> 09:18.784
I like to be free.

09:18.852 --> 09:22.171
Last night I had a date
with two hot twins.

09:22.222 --> 09:23.222
Is that so?

09:23.307 --> 09:25.174
Why don't you believe me?

09:25.225 --> 09:27.059
Remember when he said he dated
Cyndi Lauper in high school?

09:27.144 --> 09:28.427
I did, I did, I did!

09:28.512 --> 09:30.179
How many times
do I have to tell you?

09:30.230 --> 09:31.981
A million,
'cause you always lie.

09:32.048 --> 09:33.566
Hey, guys.

09:33.650 --> 09:35.351
Hi.
Hey, Uncle Cy.

09:35.402 --> 09:37.019
Tammy, how was practice?

09:37.070 --> 09:38.187
I hit two home runs.

09:38.238 --> 09:39.989
Oh! Whoo!

09:40.056 --> 09:41.908
Hey, Mom, what's
the deal with my dress?

09:41.992 --> 09:43.359
On your bed.

09:43.410 --> 09:44.410
Really?

09:44.494 --> 09:45.444
Mm-hmm.

09:45.529 --> 09:47.530
Ah!

09:47.581 --> 09:48.998
Where's she going?

09:49.065 --> 09:51.167
Homecoming's tomorrow night.

09:51.234 --> 09:53.169
I loved homecoming.

09:53.236 --> 09:55.254
Well, we'll be taking
pictures before she leaves.

09:55.339 --> 09:56.372
Why don't you stop by?

09:56.423 --> 09:58.124
Oh, and maybe
I could tape it.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.176
No, that's ok, Cy.
You don't have to.

10:00.243 --> 10:01.627
Why not? It'll be fun.

10:01.712 --> 10:03.179
No, no, no.
What would be fun

10:03.246 --> 10:04.547
would be if you and I
take a break.

10:07.184 --> 10:09.218
I can see
the Doctor's working.

10:09.269 --> 10:12.054
Counseling's worth every penny.

10:23.650 --> 10:26.035
Excuse me.

10:26.102 --> 10:29.071
Do you know where
Church Street is?

10:29.122 --> 10:31.908
Uh, you're on Church Street.

10:31.959 --> 10:33.826
Uh-huh.
I am?

10:37.080 --> 10:39.615
See...you're standing
right here.

10:39.666 --> 10:43.386
Just walk. Shh, shh.
Just walk. Come on.

10:43.453 --> 10:45.304
This way. Come on.

10:53.981 --> 10:56.513
Reid and JJ went to
the local thrift shop

10:56.538 --> 10:58.079
and found Abby's clothes.

10:58.151 --> 10:59.902
So he sold them.

10:59.970 --> 11:01.988
Or traded them
for the eighties clothing.

11:02.072 --> 11:04.143
The sales clerk said
the clothes in

11:04.168 --> 11:06.519
the crime scene photos
were of that time period,

11:06.520 --> 11:08.904
and he confirmed that they
were purchased from his store.

11:08.996 --> 11:10.529
So if he's getting rid
of his souvenirs.

11:10.614 --> 11:11.831
What's he using to
remember his victims?

11:11.915 --> 11:14.500
And why is he fixated
on this era?

11:14.584 --> 11:15.701
What do you got?

11:15.786 --> 11:18.204
The brutality the victims
experienced was immense.

11:18.288 --> 11:20.773
Multiple stab wounds
to the neck and chest,

11:20.841 --> 11:22.208
plus wounds to the genital.

11:22.292 --> 11:23.759
Frustration and overkill.

11:23.827 --> 11:26.762
The same chemical damage
on the skin

11:26.830 --> 11:28.681
is also around her nostrils.

11:28.765 --> 11:30.933
He poured the
sulfuric acid there as well.

11:31.001 --> 11:33.019
And that would destroy
their sense of smell, yes?

11:33.103 --> 11:34.136
Absolutely.

11:34.187 --> 11:35.771
He didn't do that
to the first victim.

11:35.839 --> 11:37.273
No, he's escalating.

11:37.340 --> 11:39.608
And blinding isn't
his only signature.

11:39.676 --> 11:43.312
No, he's trying
to take away their senses.

11:47.234 --> 11:49.735
I like when women scream.

11:49.820 --> 11:52.238
It reminds me
of the roller coaster.

11:53.490 --> 11:55.524
I like roller coasters.

11:55.575 --> 11:58.494
Especially in the summertime.

12:01.415 --> 12:04.199
Somebody please help me!

12:04.251 --> 12:05.751
Somebody!

12:05.836 --> 12:07.420
Aah!

12:07.504 --> 12:09.505
Aah!

12:13.427 --> 12:15.044
What? You don't like
the way I taste?!

12:15.095 --> 12:16.429
No!

12:16.513 --> 12:18.047
Well, I can help you
with that.

12:19.549 --> 12:23.352
Please, please...

12:23.403 --> 12:25.571
Somebody help me!

12:25.655 --> 12:29.325
Somebody please help me!

12:43.457 --> 12:46.575
No, no. No...

12:58.602 --> 13:01.442
Again he's disposing
in an area frequented by

13:01.443 --> 13:02.596
homeless people.

13:02.597 --> 13:06.099
It's equidistant
to the last two dump sites.

13:09.937 --> 13:13.323
He burned her tongue with
the chemical this time.

13:13.408 --> 13:15.042
So he removed
her ability to taste.

13:15.109 --> 13:16.510
Why would he do that?

13:16.578 --> 13:18.078
Historically this kind
of torture was used

13:18.129 --> 13:19.713
to prevent someone
from revealing a secret.

13:19.780 --> 13:22.583
- Maybe she offended him.
- I wonder what that's like.

13:22.634 --> 13:24.618
Her lips are extremely
chapped.

13:24.669 --> 13:27.004
She was probably forced
to repeatedly participate

13:27.088 --> 13:28.505
in some sort of
kissing fantasy.

13:28.590 --> 13:31.592
And when things go awry, he
takes the offending sense away.

13:31.643 --> 13:33.927
He tortured her in these clothes,
which means the eighties

13:33.978 --> 13:35.395
are essential
to his delusion.

13:35.463 --> 13:36.897
Maybe that's when
this rejection occurred

13:36.965 --> 13:38.849
and he held on
to the clothes all these years.

13:38.933 --> 13:41.635
And now he's attacking girls who
remind him of women from that time.

13:41.686 --> 13:43.270
He's fixated
on her type

13:43.321 --> 13:44.905
and remakes them
fit his fantasy.

13:44.972 --> 13:46.073
But why start now?

13:46.140 --> 13:47.941
Something probably
triggered it,

13:47.992 --> 13:51.161
and instead of dealing with it,
he's acting out.

13:56.584 --> 13:58.250
We believe the unsub
or unknown subject

13:58.275 --> 14:00.619
that we're looking for
is a white male in his 40s.

14:00.672 --> 14:02.789
This is someone who's reacting
to rejection by a woman

14:02.841 --> 14:05.008
when he was teenager
in the 1980s.

14:05.093 --> 14:07.511
He's punishing his victims
for their reactions to him

14:07.595 --> 14:10.597
by taking away their senses
with sulfuric acid.

14:10.665 --> 14:13.050
We believe our unsub
could possibly work part-time

14:13.134 --> 14:14.601
as a janitor or a mechanic,

14:14.669 --> 14:17.187
which would give him
access to this chemical.

14:17.272 --> 14:18.689
And after studying
the disposal sites,

14:18.773 --> 14:20.440
we think it's likely
that he is homeless.

14:20.508 --> 14:22.943
Now, how do we typically react
toward the homeless?

14:23.010 --> 14:24.811
We judge them by
their looks and smells.

14:24.863 --> 14:26.480
It's that same negative reaction
we believe that a woman

14:27.560 --> 14:29.697
had toward the unsub at some
point in the eighties.

14:29.984 --> 14:31.524
The unsub's fixation
on this woman

14:31.549 --> 14:33.148
is now all-consuming.

14:33.288 --> 14:36.206
It's caused him to develop
obsessive love disorder.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.242
He most likely
has tunnel vision

14:38.326 --> 14:41.545
and believes that she holds
the key to his happiness.

14:41.629 --> 14:44.665
He will stalk her in
an attempt to win her back.

14:44.716 --> 14:47.167
He will do whatever it takes
to be near his love interest.

14:47.218 --> 14:50.170
But her rejection will
spiral him into a depression.

14:50.221 --> 14:51.672
Which would lead
to rape and murder

14:51.723 --> 14:53.223
of the surrogates
who represent her.

14:53.308 --> 14:54.808
And it's only
a matter of time

14:54.875 --> 14:57.678
before this rage and anger
causes the unsub

14:57.729 --> 14:59.479
to go after her directly.

15:03.851 --> 15:07.688
Let's go, let's fight,
let's win tonight!

15:07.739 --> 15:11.358
Let's go, let's fight,
let's win tonight!

15:11.409 --> 15:12.544
Let's go, let's fight,
let's win tonight!

15:12.569 --> 15:13.769
Lyla?

15:24.238 --> 15:26.206
You've got to be kidding!

15:26.257 --> 15:28.908
Give me a break, Cy.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.344
Leave me alone, Matt!

15:34.432 --> 15:35.882
Tammy?

15:35.934 --> 15:37.768
Hello!

16:06.280 --> 16:09.333
Spence. Look, we gotta
talk about this.

16:09.417 --> 16:10.834
I don't want
to talk about it.

16:10.918 --> 16:12.836
I get it, ok?
You're disappointed

16:12.920 --> 16:14.171
with the way
we handled Emily.

16:14.255 --> 16:15.839
Listen, I have a lot
going on, all right?

16:15.923 --> 16:17.341
What?
You know what I think it is?

16:17.408 --> 16:20.010
You're mad that Hotch and I
controlled our micro-expressions

16:20.094 --> 16:22.562
at the hospital and you weren't able
to detect our deception.

16:22.630 --> 16:24.481
You think it's about
my profiling skills?

16:24.565 --> 16:26.183
Jennifer, listen,
the only reason

16:26.267 --> 16:28.435
you were able
to manage my perceptions

16:28.486 --> 16:30.988
is because I trusted you.
I came to your house

16:31.072 --> 16:33.240
for 10 weeks in a row
crying over losing a friend,

16:33.307 --> 16:35.993
and not once did you have the
decency to tell me the truth.

16:36.077 --> 16:36.994
I couldn't.

16:37.078 --> 16:38.328
You couldn't?
Or you wouldn't?

16:38.413 --> 16:39.579
No, I couldn't.

16:39.647 --> 16:41.198
What if I started
taking Dilaudid again?

16:41.282 --> 16:42.649
Would you have let me?

16:42.700 --> 16:44.618
You didn't.

16:44.669 --> 16:46.703
Yeah, but I
thought about it.

16:46.788 --> 16:47.804
Spence.

16:49.207 --> 16:51.258
I'm sorry.

16:51.325 --> 16:52.959
It's too late, all right?

16:53.011 --> 16:55.178
Reid.

17:01.386 --> 17:04.137
Oh, Cy, why don't you
just crash here?

17:04.188 --> 17:05.638
I may for a bit.

17:05.690 --> 17:07.808
You know, if mom and dad
were alive, they'd make you.

17:07.858 --> 17:09.443
You ought to try and have
a nice life.

17:09.510 --> 17:10.777
I have a nice life.

17:10.845 --> 17:14.448
When things get bad, I go out
on this ship made of clay.

17:14.515 --> 17:15.982
Of clay, Cy?

17:16.034 --> 17:18.402
Last night I took
another girl out on it.

17:18.486 --> 17:20.119
Yeah? When can we meet her?

17:20.186 --> 17:22.021
Never.

17:22.073 --> 17:23.490
She's dead to me.

17:24.876 --> 17:26.410
What do you think?

17:26.493 --> 17:28.829
I lightened my hair
in your honor Mom.

17:28.880 --> 17:33.200
Oh, my, you're beautiful!

17:35.386 --> 17:37.287
Where's the camera?

17:38.473 --> 17:40.173
You look just like
your mom did in high school.

17:40.224 --> 17:41.708
That's 'cause I'm wearing
the same dress.

17:41.759 --> 17:42.709
Mom cut it shorter.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.177
Ohh...

17:44.228 --> 17:45.545
So, can I stay out
till 2:00?

17:45.596 --> 17:47.681
Nice try.
You can go to the dance

17:47.732 --> 17:48.982
and then the party
at the motel,

17:49.049 --> 17:50.817
but Debbie's mom's
picking you up at midnight.

17:50.885 --> 17:52.652
- Ok.
- Ok.

17:52.720 --> 17:53.737
Have fun.

17:53.821 --> 17:56.022
Thank you.

18:00.912 --> 18:03.029
It would have had to have been
a woman very close to the unsub

18:03.081 --> 18:04.448
to make him react this way.

18:04.565 --> 18:06.032
Then why go after
surrogates?

18:06.084 --> 18:09.019
I don't think we're dealing
with a typical homeless person.

18:09.087 --> 18:10.420
He's good with chemicals,
owns a car.

18:10.505 --> 18:12.372
I think the only mistake in our
profile was assuming there was

18:12.423 --> 18:14.841
something wrong with
his physical composition,

18:14.909 --> 18:16.510
reducing him to some
sort of stereotype.

18:16.577 --> 18:18.512
You think it's only
his mental state?

18:18.579 --> 18:21.581
I think this guy might be smart
enough to use his disability

18:21.632 --> 18:24.634
to his advantage so he comes
across as harmless.

18:24.719 --> 18:26.386
Then when he's alone and the
victim rejects him, he goes off.

18:26.437 --> 18:28.249
What if he doesn't live
on the street?

18:28.274 --> 18:29.633
What if he's in a halfway house?

18:29.724 --> 18:30.974
Garcia, I need a list
of halfway houses

18:31.058 --> 18:33.143
and mental health centers
in the unsub's comfort zone.

18:33.227 --> 18:35.762
Ok. 5 are being sent
to your phones.

18:35.830 --> 18:37.981
Which of those were around
in the eighties, Garcia?

18:38.065 --> 18:39.950
There are two in your area.

18:40.017 --> 18:42.119
Morgan and Prentiss, take the first.
Dave and I will take the second.

18:42.203 --> 18:43.537
What about us?

18:43.604 --> 18:46.189
Stay here and check ViCAP
for similar M.O.s and signatures.

18:46.257 --> 18:48.125
Reid.

18:48.209 --> 18:50.544
If you want to be mad
at someone, be mad at me.

18:50.611 --> 18:55.215
I can't. I didn't come to your
house crying for 10 weeks.

18:57.251 --> 18:59.169
I've worked here
over 15 years.

18:59.253 --> 19:01.671
There are many people
who fit that description.

19:01.756 --> 19:04.341
This guy would be mobile,
probably early 40s.

19:04.425 --> 19:06.143
Well, if he's got a car,

19:06.227 --> 19:08.311
then he's transitioned out
in the last few years.

19:08.396 --> 19:09.813
State budget cuts.

19:09.897 --> 19:11.681
All right, we'll need
a list of those names.

19:11.766 --> 19:12.816
It ain't gonna be small.

19:16.804 --> 19:18.655
Hey, Morgan.

19:18.739 --> 19:19.656
Hmm?

19:19.740 --> 19:21.274
What do I do about Reid?

19:21.325 --> 19:25.162
Emily, there's a lot about you
being back that's unresolved.

19:25.246 --> 19:27.697
Are you pissed at me, too?

19:27.782 --> 19:29.199
Come on, now.

19:29.283 --> 19:31.535
How can I be?
You're here.

19:31.619 --> 19:33.453
Thank you.

19:33.504 --> 19:35.205
Because I know
what you went through.

19:35.289 --> 19:38.258
Grief counseling.
You carried my coffin.

19:38.325 --> 19:40.177
Yeah, I sure did.
What was in that thing, anyway?

19:40.261 --> 19:41.294
I don't know.

19:41.345 --> 19:42.512
Here you go.

19:42.597 --> 19:44.931
Thank you very much.

19:44.999 --> 19:46.349
Look,

19:46.434 --> 19:48.718
just give Reid some time.

19:48.803 --> 19:50.353
He'll be fine.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.057
Thanks.

19:54.141 --> 19:55.525
Yeah, Hotch, it's me,
Morgan. Listen,

19:55.610 --> 19:58.061
19 people entered
this house in the eighties

19:58.145 --> 19:59.863
who were let out
in the last 5 years.

19:59.947 --> 20:01.381
We got 11 from
the one we visited.

20:01.449 --> 20:03.316
Send your names to Garcia.
Have her cross-check them

20:03.367 --> 20:05.184
against jobs
that use sulfuric acid.

20:05.236 --> 20:07.237
All right. We'll start reaching
out to the extended families.

20:07.321 --> 20:08.238
Ok.

20:08.322 --> 20:09.706
How's Reid?

20:09.790 --> 20:11.791
He's angry
and frustrated.

20:11.859 --> 20:13.877
I'm surprised
everybody isn't.

20:13.961 --> 20:16.379
Some of us
had an inkling.

20:16.464 --> 20:19.365
What? I'm good
at what I do.

20:19.417 --> 20:21.625
So, are you gonna get
psychological counseling

20:21.650 --> 20:23.901
for the team
or handle it internally?

20:24.038 --> 20:26.061
No, I think that
if we all just got together,

20:26.062 --> 20:28.172
maybe a cooking lesson and at the
home of one of one of our founders--

20:28.175 --> 20:29.809
Oh, no, not you, too.

20:29.877 --> 20:31.011
It could boost morale.

20:31.062 --> 20:33.046
Is this an order?

20:33.097 --> 20:37.934
No, it's just a--
it's a very tempered suggestion.

20:38.019 --> 20:39.886
Tempered suggestion.

20:46.911 --> 20:48.361
Hey, you all right?

20:48.412 --> 20:51.197
Yeah. Thanks,
Debbie. I just--

20:51.249 --> 20:53.399
I just need a minute.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.924
Tammy?

21:20.394 --> 21:21.695
Uncle Cy?

21:21.762 --> 21:23.730
What are you doing here?

21:23.781 --> 21:27.600
I--I was just going
to buy some beer.

21:28.953 --> 21:29.936
You ok?

21:29.987 --> 21:31.988
No.

21:38.462 --> 21:40.747
Maybe I should
take you home.

21:40.798 --> 21:42.966
I don't want to get
in trouble with mom and dad.

21:44.785 --> 21:47.087
You won't.

21:47.138 --> 21:49.455
I'll take care of you.

22:03.587 --> 22:05.867
So we interviewed the 19 people
released from the group home.

22:05.868 --> 22:07.184
None of them
fit the profile.

22:07.236 --> 22:09.320
Dave's still trying
to locate the families.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.689
Tammy Bradstone's parents
just filed a report.

22:11.740 --> 22:14.075
Their daughter didn't return
from homecoming last night.

22:14.159 --> 22:16.461
Her face
is similar to our 3 vics.

22:16.528 --> 22:17.879
She's about
the same age.

22:17.963 --> 22:19.430
Well, the after party
where she was last seen

22:19.498 --> 22:20.465
was smack in the comfort zone.

22:20.532 --> 22:22.300
Where
are her parents now?

22:22.367 --> 22:24.502
They're at the house. We're bringing
her friends in for questioning.

22:24.553 --> 22:26.888
You head over there.
We'll start the interviews here.

22:29.341 --> 22:32.760
I see on the news
on the TV,

22:32.845 --> 22:35.313
people question,

22:35.380 --> 22:39.100
they question
why people do this.

22:39.184 --> 22:42.386
It's the same reason
people do anything.

22:42.437 --> 22:45.990
'Cause they feel like it.
They like the way it feels.

22:46.057 --> 22:50.695
When I was kid, my dog Poppy
running across the grass,

22:50.746 --> 22:54.398
when I hit her,
I liked that feeling.

22:54.449 --> 22:56.751
That has not changed.

22:56.835 --> 22:59.537
Somebody help me!

22:59.588 --> 23:00.538
Help!

23:08.847 --> 23:10.014
Uncle Cy?

23:11.133 --> 23:12.583
What's happening?

23:16.722 --> 23:18.556
What did you do to me?

23:24.930 --> 23:28.649
So kids spill out
of the motel toward the cars.

23:28.717 --> 23:30.484
If Tammy
walked this way,

23:30.569 --> 23:32.870
how could she disappear without
anyone seeing her?

23:32.938 --> 23:35.105
Someone would have
heard her scream.

23:35.157 --> 23:36.657
That's if she screamed.

23:36.742 --> 23:38.159
Unlike the last 3
abduction sites,

23:38.243 --> 23:41.245
this one is nowhere near
public transportation.

23:41.296 --> 23:43.381
Maybe she knew
the unsub.

23:43.448 --> 23:45.049
Or thought she did.

23:45.116 --> 23:47.885
What if--what if Tammy
was the target all along?

23:47.953 --> 23:49.720
That would explain
the change in the M.O.

23:49.788 --> 23:53.140
So whoever did this
knew she was coming here.

23:59.097 --> 24:00.398
Hi, hi, hi.

24:00.465 --> 24:02.567
Hey, baby girl, I need you to
work that magic for me.

24:02.634 --> 24:03.901
Anything, my sweetest.

24:03.969 --> 24:06.103
I just opened up
Tammy Bradstone's computer.

24:06.154 --> 24:07.572
I want you to check
her emails, web searches,

24:07.639 --> 24:09.073
and anyone
she may have Skyped.

24:09.140 --> 24:11.659
Ok, typing at
the speed of thought.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.778
Thanks, mama.

24:22.287 --> 24:25.172
Are you gonna find
my sister?

24:26.825 --> 24:29.427
We're gonna try,
little man.

24:29.494 --> 24:32.296
Listen, uh,
did your sister

24:32.347 --> 24:33.931
dye her hair recently?

24:33.999 --> 24:36.517
Yeah. To look nice
for the homecoming dance.

24:36.602 --> 24:39.470
She was even gonna wear
the same dress my mom did.

24:41.139 --> 24:43.583
Are you sure that Tammy
hasn't been behaving

24:43.608 --> 24:44.775
differently lately?

24:44.776 --> 24:47.361
She's 16, so she's
pretty closed off.

24:47.446 --> 24:49.363
Your daughter seems to cherish
hanging out in groups,

24:49.448 --> 24:52.366
so there's no way she would run off
with someone unless she knew them.

24:52.451 --> 24:54.118
What about her computer?

24:54.185 --> 24:55.686
Nothing out of the ordinary,
and Hotch cleared the boyfriend.

24:55.737 --> 25:01.075
Do you know anyone
who is transient or mentally ill?

25:01.159 --> 25:02.877
Uh, yeah, my brother.

25:02.961 --> 25:05.830
He didn't get enough oxygen
to his brain when he was born.

25:05.897 --> 25:06.864
What's his name?

25:06.915 --> 25:07.865
Cy Bradstone.

25:07.916 --> 25:09.166
On the halfway house list,

25:09.217 --> 25:11.535
all I got
was a Ben Bradstone.

25:11.586 --> 25:13.254
Oh, no, yeah,
that's his real name.

25:13.338 --> 25:14.538
Cy is the name he made up.

25:14.589 --> 25:16.057
Where does he live?

25:16.141 --> 25:19.343
He crashes here from time to time,
but he's basically homeless.

25:19.394 --> 25:22.212
His frontal lobe damage

25:22.264 --> 25:24.315
is one of the indicators
of serial killers.

25:24.382 --> 25:25.542
Cy isn't a serial killer.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.239
He wouldn't hurt anybody,
especially not my daughter.

25:27.552 --> 25:28.986
Come on.

25:29.054 --> 25:29.987
Come on!

25:33.158 --> 25:34.275
Shh, shh, shh.

25:34.359 --> 25:35.993
Shh...

25:37.062 --> 25:40.531
Shh, shh. Just
a little bit further.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.083
I want to tell you
a story.

25:43.401 --> 25:45.703
Has Cy ever acted
inappropriately toward Tammy?

25:45.754 --> 25:47.705
No. I wouldn't let him
in here if he had.

25:47.756 --> 25:50.041
Ok, so he sleeps here
sometimes,

25:50.092 --> 25:52.209
and his head
is on this side.

25:52.260 --> 25:54.295
That puts the TV
out of his sight.

25:54.379 --> 25:56.047
Since when
is that a crime?

25:56.098 --> 26:00.184
Well, it just gives him
a full view of the kitchen.

26:00.252 --> 26:01.385
Does Tammy cook for him?

26:01.436 --> 26:03.604
No. Lyla does.

26:06.274 --> 26:10.811
Ma'am, what's your
relationship with Cy?

26:10.896 --> 26:12.563
I've known him
since 10th grade.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.031
That was 1985.

26:14.099 --> 26:16.701
He makes you uncomfortable,
doesn't he?

26:18.704 --> 26:20.571
Did you have blond hair
in high school?

26:20.622 --> 26:22.707
Yes. What are you
getting at?

26:22.774 --> 26:24.825
Sir, your daughter
just dyed her hair blond.

26:24.910 --> 26:26.660
You allowed her
to wear your dress.

26:26.728 --> 26:30.948
I'm just thinking it may have
triggered something for Cy.

26:33.135 --> 26:35.786
What happened
with you and Cy

26:35.837 --> 26:37.955
that made him
so angry?

26:45.130 --> 26:47.314
Honey, what is it?

26:49.184 --> 26:51.802
When I was 16,

26:51.853 --> 26:55.305
my friends and I went to
a party after homecoming.

26:55.357 --> 26:58.025
Everyone had been drinking.

26:58.110 --> 27:00.911
Damn. I'm seeing stars.

27:00.979 --> 27:03.164
Let's play
spin the bottle.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.868
When it was your mom's turn,

27:07.953 --> 27:11.489
she spun it
and it landed on me.

27:11.556 --> 27:14.375
You should have seen her face.

27:14.459 --> 27:19.764
She lit up like--
like a lite brite.

27:19.831 --> 27:21.549
I didn't know what to do.

27:21.633 --> 27:23.100
My friends laughed,

27:23.168 --> 27:26.854
but I didn't want
to be mean, so I...

27:26.938 --> 27:29.390
Went in the closet
with him.

27:29.474 --> 27:31.892
And what happened next?

27:31.977 --> 27:34.311
I let him feel me up.

27:34.362 --> 27:37.314
How did he behave
after that?

27:37.365 --> 27:39.900
He started following me
around at school.

27:39.985 --> 27:43.654
Then one day
he overheard me tell a friend

27:43.705 --> 27:46.123
how gross I thought he was.

27:46.191 --> 27:48.659
How he talked,
how he smelled?

27:48.710 --> 27:50.911
Why didn't you
tell me this?

27:50.996 --> 27:54.031
I was 16.

27:54.082 --> 27:57.001
We had just started dating.

27:57.052 --> 28:00.087
Does Cy know about your
recent marital problems?

28:00.172 --> 28:02.473
I told him a couple
months ago.

28:02.540 --> 28:05.509
And then he probably started
making advances towards you,

28:05.577 --> 28:08.229
which you had to reject.

28:08.313 --> 28:11.348
That's what triggered
the killings.

28:11.399 --> 28:12.566
I did this?

28:12.651 --> 28:13.934
No. No, ma'am.

28:14.019 --> 28:15.486
The events did.

28:15.553 --> 28:17.554
Does Cy have
a part-time job?

28:17.606 --> 28:19.890
Yeah, he works at
a couple garages.

28:19.941 --> 28:21.826
One on Drake,
the other on Fourth.

28:21.893 --> 28:23.227
That explains
the sulfuric acid.

28:23.278 --> 28:25.112
We'll need
those addresses.

28:25.197 --> 28:27.698
Ok. Excuse me.

28:31.453 --> 28:33.332
Ok, so, as long as Tammy
doesn't do anything

28:33.333 --> 28:35.644
to antagonize him,
we may have a chance.

28:39.410 --> 28:41.078
Oh, my God.

28:41.129 --> 28:43.347
It's you!

28:43.414 --> 28:45.216
You're the one that
my mom told me about.

28:45.267 --> 28:47.134
Uh-huh. Yes.

28:47.219 --> 28:48.385
You took advantage
of her

28:48.436 --> 28:50.054
when she was drunk
at a party.

28:51.256 --> 28:54.024
No, that's--that's not true.

28:54.092 --> 28:55.693
Yes.

28:55.760 --> 28:59.530
That's probably why
she won't touch you now.

28:59.597 --> 29:01.365
That's why
she won't touch me?

29:01.432 --> 29:04.818
Yeah. Because you forced
yourself on her.

29:04.903 --> 29:06.987
Ohh!

29:10.742 --> 29:12.776
You shouldn't have
done that, Tammy.

29:12.827 --> 29:14.912
You should have kept
your mouth shut!

29:22.146 --> 29:25.014
You won't get away
with this, Uncle Cy.

29:25.778 --> 29:27.779
They'll find you.

29:27.846 --> 29:31.116
They can't find me, Tammy.

29:31.183 --> 29:34.652
They're not looking for me.

29:40.859 --> 29:43.128
When Cy comes to the house,

29:43.195 --> 29:45.713
he gets out of the car

29:45.798 --> 29:47.632
and he goes to the door.

29:47.699 --> 29:48.750
Yeah.

29:48.834 --> 29:50.752
How do you know
he's here?

29:50.836 --> 29:53.037
I can hear his truck.

29:53.088 --> 29:54.789
So then you head
to the front door.

29:54.857 --> 29:55.807
Yes.

29:55.874 --> 29:57.425
There you are, Cy.

29:57.510 --> 29:59.794
When you open it,
what do you smell?

29:59.862 --> 30:03.932
He smells musty,
like he needs to take a shower.

30:04.016 --> 30:05.716
Are you sure that's
all you smell?

30:05.768 --> 30:07.485
I smell chemicals.

30:07.553 --> 30:09.154
He smells like chemicals.

30:09.221 --> 30:12.273
What does he do next?

30:12.358 --> 30:17.695
He crushes a cup, and--
and he puts it in his bag.

30:17.746 --> 30:20.331
Where's it from?
Is there a name on the cup?

30:20.399 --> 30:24.335
It's a soda
from a coffee shop.

30:24.403 --> 30:26.371
The Way Station.

30:26.422 --> 30:27.839
It's down the street.

30:27.906 --> 30:31.009
Ok. He probably stops there
every time he comes here.

30:31.076 --> 30:32.743
What days would those be?

30:32.795 --> 30:36.214
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
Sometimes Saturday.

30:36.265 --> 30:37.849
Which means
he'd be coming today.

30:37.916 --> 30:42.503
I need you to leave
a message for him there.

30:42.571 --> 30:46.608
I'm going to go get
us something to eat.

30:46.692 --> 30:49.444
Don't worry, Tammy.

30:49.528 --> 30:53.147
There are other sports
to play.

31:08.380 --> 31:10.048
- Any luck?
- He hasn't been to either

31:10.115 --> 31:12.300
of the mechanics' shops
in the past two months.

31:12.384 --> 31:14.252
But the one on Fourth
said a bunch of car batteries

31:14.303 --> 31:15.253
had gone missing.

31:18.140 --> 31:19.507
Wait--

31:21.493 --> 31:23.478
Yeah?

31:23.562 --> 31:25.563
Morgan, it's from a pay phone
near a coffee shop.

31:25.631 --> 31:27.265
It's him.

31:27.316 --> 31:30.968
Ok, go ahead. Just
like we talked about.

31:35.241 --> 31:36.357
Hello?

31:36.442 --> 31:37.659
Hi, it's Cy.

31:37.743 --> 31:39.761
Paulie said you were
looking for me.

31:42.448 --> 31:45.199
Lyla, what's wrong, Lyla?

31:47.002 --> 31:49.420
Matt got arrested.

31:49.488 --> 31:53.124
What? Lyla, what
are you talking about?

31:53.175 --> 31:57.178
They think that
he hurt Tammy.

32:00.832 --> 32:02.884
Oh, God, Cy.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.638
I need you.

32:06.689 --> 32:09.107
Shh. Don't--don't cry.

32:09.174 --> 32:10.475
Lyla, don't--don't cry.

32:10.526 --> 32:12.894
Everything's gonna be
all right.

32:12.978 --> 32:19.817
I just--I--I need you
to, uh, come over here and--

32:19.868 --> 32:25.239
I need you to talk.
I need you to hold me.

32:25.324 --> 32:27.458
You--you do?

32:27.526 --> 32:29.193
Yes. I--

32:29.244 --> 32:32.297
Hurry. I have no one
else to turn to.

32:32.364 --> 32:35.750
I'll be there, Lyla.
I'll be there.

32:35.834 --> 32:38.503
He's coming.

32:38.554 --> 32:39.754
You and Prentiss
stay with them.

32:39.838 --> 32:41.339
Morgan and I will
get the front.

32:51.900 --> 32:54.218
Lyla!

32:55.938 --> 32:59.123
Lyla.

32:59.191 --> 33:00.358
Shh...

33:16.709 --> 33:18.343
It's gonna be ok.

33:18.410 --> 33:20.963
Shh. It's gonna be ok.

33:21.063 --> 33:23.150
Cy Bradstone! FBI!

33:23.175 --> 33:24.893
Put your hands
where I can see them!

33:25.300 --> 33:27.201
Let me see your hands!

33:27.269 --> 33:28.970
On your knees, now!

33:33.392 --> 33:34.809
How could you do this to me?

33:34.893 --> 33:35.810
Get up.

33:35.894 --> 33:37.928
How could you do this
to me?!

33:37.980 --> 33:40.615
Stop moving. Stop it!

33:46.655 --> 33:49.607
We need to know
where Tammy is, Cy.

33:49.658 --> 33:53.911
We've looked in your car.
There's no sign of her.

33:53.962 --> 33:55.913
We know this isn't
about Tammy.

33:55.964 --> 33:57.715
This is about
your love for Lyla.

33:57.783 --> 33:58.716
Lyla?

33:58.784 --> 34:01.386
Lie-la!

34:01.453 --> 34:05.590
You and Lyla had a pretty
good secret all these years.

34:05.657 --> 34:07.675
How'd she get you
to shut up about it?

34:11.096 --> 34:12.679
One time.

34:12.764 --> 34:14.799
That's all I needed.

34:14.850 --> 34:18.803
Is that where you, uh,
did it, Cy?

34:18.853 --> 34:20.938
Is that the same place
you took Tammy?

34:20.989 --> 34:22.522
We know when you saw her
in that dress,

34:22.547 --> 34:24.054
it made you
think of Lyla.

34:25.360 --> 34:28.978
Tammy's not the one
you want to hurt, Cy.

34:29.031 --> 34:31.581
Lyla's the one
that should be punished.

34:31.650 --> 34:33.501
She's the one who made you
feel like a freak.

34:33.585 --> 34:37.922
A reject, a weirdo.

34:37.989 --> 34:40.591
Tell us where Tammy is, Cy,
and we can be done.

34:40.659 --> 34:42.427
Done?

34:42.494 --> 34:44.011
Finished.

34:44.096 --> 34:45.679
Finished?

34:47.599 --> 34:49.516
Well, I can--I can do that.

34:50.835 --> 34:53.003
Under one condition.

35:01.012 --> 35:03.397
Now, where's Tammy, Cy?

35:04.683 --> 35:06.984
Hey!

35:07.035 --> 35:09.854
What did you do
with my daughter?

35:09.905 --> 35:12.790
Lyla was an angel.

35:12.858 --> 35:17.062
Like--like a prize
in the Crackerjack box.

35:17.122 --> 35:18.771
When she would
come into the room,

35:18.796 --> 35:21.235
my heart would race.

35:23.368 --> 35:26.804
When I saw Tammy
in that dress,

35:26.872 --> 35:28.890
it took me back there.

35:31.393 --> 35:35.680
Cy, just tell me
where she is.

35:35.731 --> 35:39.884
I took her.
We did things.

35:41.720 --> 35:47.608
Everything was going good
un-until she said those words.

35:47.693 --> 35:49.226
What did she say, Cy?

35:49.278 --> 35:51.395
She said...

35:55.534 --> 35:57.288
She said the reason
her mother always

35:57.313 --> 35:58.713
backed up when I came over

36:00.255 --> 36:03.925
was because she didn't want
to feel me touching her.

36:04.009 --> 36:05.927
So guess what I did, Matt.

36:06.011 --> 36:07.345
You guess!

36:09.381 --> 36:10.848
What did you do, Cy?

36:10.916 --> 36:14.018
I made it so she couldn't
feel either.

36:24.229 --> 36:25.613
Shh, shh, shh.

36:25.697 --> 36:27.815
Aah!

36:27.900 --> 36:30.818
She screamed so loud.

36:33.455 --> 36:35.740
But no one could hear her.

36:35.791 --> 36:37.491
Where do you have her?

36:37.576 --> 36:40.878
The same place I told him
about my love.

36:40.946 --> 36:43.247
Guess who I went
to second base with.

36:43.298 --> 36:44.248
Who, Cy?

36:44.299 --> 36:45.249
Lyla Smith.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.417
Bull!

36:46.468 --> 36:47.752
Get back here.

36:47.803 --> 36:49.420
Why don't you
believe me?

36:49.471 --> 36:51.305
Because you lie!

36:55.477 --> 36:56.761
You never told me that.

36:56.812 --> 36:58.963
Yes, I did, yes, I did,
yes, I did!

36:59.014 --> 37:02.299
But you thought I was lying
and then you married my girl!

37:02.351 --> 37:06.136
So this is what you do, Cy?
Why didn't you just hurt me?

37:06.188 --> 37:08.305
I take away
your senses, Matt.

37:09.825 --> 37:13.494
The last one is hearing.

37:13.579 --> 37:16.080
And if I take that,

37:16.147 --> 37:18.734
you wouldn't be able to listen
to what I did to her.

37:18.735 --> 37:20.032
You son of a bitch!
You taped--

37:20.057 --> 37:21.732
you taped my daughter?!

37:22.287 --> 37:23.921
- You son of a bitch!
- You son of a bitch!

37:23.989 --> 37:27.925
You son of a bitch!
Ha ha ha ha!

37:46.144 --> 37:47.645
Clear!

37:51.817 --> 37:54.351
She's got a pulse.
I need a medic in here!

38:02.878 --> 38:04.495
Oh, jeez.

38:11.870 --> 38:13.587
Scott Adams wrote,

38:13.672 --> 38:17.925
"Nothing inspires forgiveness
quite like revenge."

38:27.736 --> 38:31.422
So, the surgeon said
he believes he can restore

38:31.447 --> 38:33.120
feeling to Tammy's hands.

38:33.892 --> 38:36.243
Good. We got there in time.

38:41.900 --> 38:44.702
I heard Mr. Bradstone
wants to watch the tape.

38:44.753 --> 38:47.162
People have an innate
curiosity to see things

38:47.187 --> 38:48.655
in order to confirm them.

38:50.075 --> 38:54.428
Oh, that explains why I'm
going to Rossi's tomorrow night.

38:54.513 --> 38:57.264
I want to see
if he really can cook.

38:58.583 --> 38:59.884
You coming?

38:59.935 --> 39:02.920
I don't know.
I'm not so sure I can make it.

39:11.646 --> 39:15.983
Look, Reid, I know
you're mad at us

39:16.068 --> 39:18.435
because we didn't
tell you what really happened,

39:18.487 --> 39:20.454
and I understand that.

39:22.641 --> 39:26.777
But I promise you,
we had no choice.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.118
You mourned the loss
of a friend.

39:35.887 --> 39:39.090
I mourned the loss of 6.

39:43.345 --> 39:45.796
This whole thing
gave me an ulcer.

39:45.847 --> 39:48.182
Please don't give me
another one.

39:51.319 --> 39:54.739
Are you gonna go
to Rossi's tomorrow?

39:56.408 --> 39:57.942
We'll see.

40:32.277 --> 40:36.363
Now, Matt, you might not
want to watch this.

40:36.448 --> 40:40.618
But this is what I'm going
to do to your daughter.

40:40.685 --> 40:43.788
But what I did
with your wife,

40:43.855 --> 40:48.159
now, that's a tape
you should see.

40:52.197 --> 40:54.965
No! Stop!

40:55.033 --> 40:57.635
Shh, shh...

40:57.702 --> 41:01.055
Aah! Stop!

41:04.042 --> 41:07.228
Cooking is the most
sensual art form.

41:07.295 --> 41:09.630
And these are my paints.

41:09.698 --> 41:12.016
So your hands must
be brushes.

41:12.067 --> 41:13.818
Don't interrupt.

41:13.885 --> 41:16.353
In a pot of boiling water
we cook our spaghetti

41:16.404 --> 41:19.023
until it's al dente,
firm to the tooth.

41:19.090 --> 41:20.658
Here you go.
Everybody pass it around.

41:20.725 --> 41:23.527
See? Feel the texture.
There we go. Ok.

41:23.578 --> 41:25.196
Now...

41:25.247 --> 41:27.031
In a large pan,

41:27.082 --> 41:28.983
we fry up our pancetta.

41:29.050 --> 41:32.453
Keeping a sharp eye
that the edges are crisp.

41:32.537 --> 41:33.671
But careful not to
burn the onions.

41:33.738 --> 41:34.839
Bravo, Aaron!

41:34.906 --> 41:38.292
We saute until translucence.

41:39.678 --> 41:40.594
Uh--I got it.

41:40.679 --> 41:42.463
Grazie mille.

41:42.547 --> 41:43.797
Uh-uh-uh!

41:45.934 --> 41:47.468
Now, we mix in the eggs...

41:47.552 --> 41:49.937
the parmesan...

41:50.021 --> 41:51.856
the spaghett...

41:51.923 --> 41:53.140
and parsley.

41:53.225 --> 41:56.894
You see, it's all about
timing and rhythm.

41:56.945 --> 42:00.114
And if you don't feel
yourself doing it properly,

42:00.198 --> 42:02.950
please, order a pizza.

42:04.035 --> 42:05.569
Sorry I'm late.

42:05.620 --> 42:07.955
Yeah. And this is why
I cook alone.

42:11.209 --> 42:13.627
So, uh, when do we
get to drink the wine?

42:13.712 --> 42:14.879
Almost there.

42:14.946 --> 42:18.082
Ok. We start
at the beginning.

42:18.133 --> 42:19.750
You eat what you cook,

42:19.801 --> 42:21.302
I'll supervise,

42:21.369 --> 42:23.971
but we're gonna do this
all together,

42:24.055 --> 42:26.924
just like a family.

42:26.975 --> 42:28.175
Ok now?

42:28.260 --> 42:30.094
Now.
