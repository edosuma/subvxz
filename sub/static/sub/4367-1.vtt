00:03.173 --> 00:06.376
_

00:09.926 --> 00:11.143
There we go.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.262
Now, can you see me?

00:16.768 --> 00:20.269
Excellent.
Next question.

00:20.271 --> 00:21.987
Who am I?

00:21.989 --> 00:25.388
_

00:33.283 --> 00:35.117
You knew what we were building here.

00:35.119 --> 00:37.486
This thing looks
for plotters, schemers.

00:37.488 --> 00:39.672
We built it to stop terrorists
before they could act.

00:39.674 --> 00:42.491
If congress knew about
this machine you're building,

00:42.493 --> 00:44.260
you would go to jail.

00:44.262 --> 00:45.795
I don't suppose
they'd let us be cell-mates.

00:45.797 --> 00:47.329
Knowledge is not my problem.

00:47.331 --> 00:48.931
Doing something with that knowledge,

00:48.933 --> 00:50.583
that's where you'd come in.

00:50.585 --> 00:53.168
Sooner or later, both of us
will probably wind up dead.

00:53.170 --> 00:56.672
If something ever happens,
I have a contingency.

00:56.674 --> 00:59.608
We got a new number, Caroline Turing.

00:59.610 --> 01:01.360
She put the hit on herself.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.512
She was trying to lure you
out into the open.

01:03.514 --> 01:05.898
She wasn't looking for me.
She was looking for him.

01:07.184 --> 01:09.368
So nice to finally meet you, Harold.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.186
You can call me Root.

01:11.188 --> 01:15.524
He's in danger now,
because he was working for you,

01:15.526 --> 01:18.043
so you're gonna help me get him back.

01:41.686 --> 01:44.153
Family, Alpha, Mike.

01:44.155 --> 01:47.239
Reflections, Juliet, Oscar.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.842
You look famished, Harold.

02:06.844 --> 02:09.244
What are you gonna have?

02:11.798 --> 02:14.750
No offense,
but for a billionaire genius,

02:14.752 --> 02:17.970
you're lousy company.

02:22.275 --> 02:27.146
Every system has a flaw.
I'm pretty good at finding them.

02:27.148 --> 02:29.448
You care about other people.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.784
That's your flaw.

02:31.786 --> 02:34.870
So if you try to call out
to that police officer,

02:34.872 --> 02:37.406
I won't shoot you.

02:37.408 --> 02:39.959
I'll shoot someone else.

02:42.028 --> 02:45.464
Please, don't make me do that.

02:48.117 --> 02:50.252
I get it.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.954
You're not talking
because you don't know

02:51.956 --> 02:55.174
how much I already know.

02:55.176 --> 02:56.959
I know enough.

02:56.961 --> 02:59.128
Enough that you should be
trying to figure out

02:59.130 --> 03:01.096
what I want and where we're going.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.749
Where are we going?

03:03.751 --> 03:07.069
The future, Harold.

03:07.071 --> 03:09.688
Although I guess, thanks to you,
we're already there.

03:09.690 --> 03:14.309
Not that you let any of us know.

03:14.311 --> 03:15.728
I don't know who you think I am,

03:15.730 --> 03:16.879
but you've made a mistake.

03:16.881 --> 03:20.449
Don't treat me like them.

03:20.451 --> 03:22.952
It... it must be like
talking to ants to you.

03:22.954 --> 03:24.987
They wouldn't grasp what you've done

03:24.989 --> 03:27.122
even if you told them,

03:27.124 --> 03:30.426
but I've been waiting for you
my whole life,

03:30.428 --> 03:34.096
and you and I share an understanding.

03:34.098 --> 03:37.800
Do we?

03:37.802 --> 03:41.336
You're a murderer and a thief.

03:41.338 --> 03:43.355
My mom told me to follow my talents,

03:43.357 --> 03:46.225
and I'm good at what I do.

03:46.227 --> 03:50.329
Except for this one time
when someone stopped me,

03:50.331 --> 03:54.733
someone who just knew
what I was about to do.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.485
How did you know, Harold?

03:56.487 --> 03:59.338
For months, that's what
I couldn't figure out.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.908
I don't believe in magic,

04:02.910 --> 04:05.294
and I knew the government
had spent years trying

04:05.296 --> 04:08.547
to build something to protect
its panicked, little flock.

04:08.549 --> 04:11.800
I also thought
they'd never pull it off,

04:11.802 --> 04:16.338
because I didn't know about you.

04:18.208 --> 04:22.678
And you pulled it off, didn't you?

04:22.680 --> 04:26.015
Something to watch over all of us.

04:26.017 --> 04:28.784
The only question, Harold,

04:28.786 --> 04:32.654
is why it didn't protect you.

04:39.362 --> 04:42.247
Taylor?

04:42.249 --> 04:43.949
Taylor?

04:43.951 --> 04:47.402
He's out...

04:47.404 --> 04:50.339
Studying with a friend.

04:50.341 --> 04:53.459
Sure, John, come on over.
Make yourself at home.

04:53.461 --> 04:56.045
Finch is gone.

04:56.047 --> 04:57.713
And she took him.

04:57.715 --> 05:00.749
- Who took him?
- Turing.

05:00.751 --> 05:03.936
She wasn't a shrink.
She was lying to us.

05:03.938 --> 05:05.437
Real name is Root,

05:05.439 --> 05:07.473
or at least that's what she goes by.

05:07.475 --> 05:11.026
What could he have
that she would want?

05:14.064 --> 05:17.950
Okay, I can file a missing persons,

05:17.952 --> 05:21.620
send Finch's picture
to sheriff's offices, the FBI.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.572
You can't.

05:23.574 --> 05:26.274
Finch went off the grid for a reason.

05:26.276 --> 05:28.577
We have to find him on our own.

05:28.579 --> 05:30.229
I have a lead,

05:30.231 --> 05:33.549
but I need you chasing down
every other angle.

05:33.551 --> 05:35.818
Listen, when she took Finch,

05:35.820 --> 05:37.920
Root killed
a former Intelligence operative

05:37.922 --> 05:39.621
named Alicia Corwin.

05:39.623 --> 05:43.642
Okay, I'll get myself
assigned to the investigation.

05:43.644 --> 05:46.728
Thank you.

05:46.730 --> 05:48.981
What are you going to be doing?

05:48.983 --> 05:51.150
I'm not sure.

05:51.152 --> 05:54.186
Math, I think.

05:58.808 --> 06:02.361
Uncertainty, Romeo, Kilo.

06:04.581 --> 06:08.033
Family, Alpha, Mike.

06:08.035 --> 06:12.671
Reflections, Juliet, Oscar.

06:18.094 --> 06:20.929
"I gave you a job,
Mr. Reese.

06:20.931 --> 06:24.766
I never said
it would be easy."

06:27.170 --> 06:32.340
Come on, Finch.
Help me find you.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.740
Title and author's initials.

06:55.715 --> 06:58.133
"Uncertainty, RK."

07:03.389 --> 07:05.807
"Family, AM."

07:06.593 --> 07:08.927
"Reflections, JO."

07:12.765 --> 07:17.269
Finch, you sly dog.
The Dewey decimal system.

07:17.271 --> 07:20.772
That's how the machine gives you
the social security numbers.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.741
Hey, I ran that social.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.860
Guy's name is Leon Tao.

07:24.862 --> 07:27.062
He's got an MBA from NYU.
No criminal record.

07:27.064 --> 07:29.031
He's got a fancy car
with an anti-theft tracker,

07:29.033 --> 07:30.732
which I took the liberty
of activating.

07:30.734 --> 07:32.868
I sent you the coordinates.

07:32.870 --> 07:35.587
I got them.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.039
You think this Mr. Tao
is gonna help you

07:37.041 --> 07:38.573
with the whereabouts
of our four-eyed friend?

07:38.575 --> 07:40.709
You almost sound concerned, Lionel.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.427
Frankly, I'm not sure
I want to find out

07:42.429 --> 07:44.079
what you're like
without his direction.

07:44.081 --> 07:46.915
Let's hope you don't have to.

07:54.942 --> 07:58.593
You mind? I need a word
with Leon, here.

07:59.779 --> 08:02.698
He's all yours, Detective.

08:08.404 --> 08:12.374
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

08:12.376 --> 08:15.627
I have a source that says
you might be able to help.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.664
I've never seen either of them.

08:18.666 --> 08:22.301
Take another look.
My source is never wrong.

08:22.303 --> 08:26.288
I've never seen either of them
before in my life,

08:26.290 --> 08:28.456
you understand?

08:32.645 --> 08:35.179
You're not lying.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.817
Then why the hell am I here?

08:38.818 --> 08:41.469
I have no idea, dude.
Truly.

08:49.145 --> 08:52.164
You've got to be kidding me.

08:52.166 --> 08:55.834
Let me guess, you're
in some kind of trouble,

08:55.836 --> 08:57.652
the life-threatening kind.

08:57.654 --> 09:00.122
I can't believe it.

09:00.124 --> 09:02.841
I'm the contingency, the backup.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.159
The what?

09:04.161 --> 09:05.544
He didn't want me to find him

09:05.546 --> 09:07.796
if anything went wrong.

09:07.798 --> 09:12.000
He just wanted me
to keep rescuing people.

09:12.002 --> 09:14.836
People like you.

09:14.838 --> 09:16.305
So what is it?

09:16.307 --> 09:18.307
You pissed these guys off somehow,

09:18.309 --> 09:19.674
and they were about ready to kill you

09:19.676 --> 09:21.693
when I just happened
to walk in the door?

09:21.695 --> 09:25.063
No, no. No, we're just...
we're just talking.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.866
No, no, no.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.785
You were right, Detective.

09:29.787 --> 09:33.705
Leon here stole
a great deal of money from us,

09:33.707 --> 09:37.793
and we'd just about done talking
when you walked in.

09:37.795 --> 09:41.213
Listen, I don't have time for this.

09:41.215 --> 09:44.132
I need to find my friend,
so I'm going to take Leon here

09:44.134 --> 09:46.468
and we're going to leave.

09:46.470 --> 09:49.805
Leon stole more than enough, in fact,

09:49.807 --> 09:52.841
to make it worth us killing a cop,

09:52.843 --> 09:55.310
so maybe we can make a deal.

09:55.312 --> 09:57.879
You leave Leon here with us,

09:57.881 --> 10:02.150
and you can
keep looking for your friend.

10:02.152 --> 10:06.154
You know, the guy
that owned this badge

10:06.156 --> 10:08.523
probably would have made that deal,

10:08.525 --> 10:11.109
but I'm not him.

10:12.561 --> 10:14.446
So who are you?

10:14.448 --> 10:19.234
The guy who shot him
and stole his badge.

10:31.080 --> 10:35.133
You coming or not, Leon?

10:45.340 --> 10:47.522
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

11:00.121 --> 11:02.205
Can you see me?

11:06.994 --> 11:09.145
I'm gonna play hide and seek.

11:09.147 --> 11:11.181
Ring my phone once for "yes,"
twice for "no."

11:11.183 --> 11:14.167
Do you understand?

11:15.469 --> 11:18.271
Can you see me now?

11:30.201 --> 11:31.201
How 'bout now?

11:33.622 --> 11:35.989
Really?

11:35.991 --> 11:37.523
How many fingers?

11:59.346 --> 12:01.848
Good.

12:01.850 --> 12:04.100
Very good.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.610
You're not gonna
help me find him, huh?

12:13.612 --> 12:17.363
Dude, I already told you,
I don't know your friend.

12:17.365 --> 12:19.916
He programmed you to do this,
didn't he?

12:20.868 --> 12:22.335
To keep giving me the numbers.

12:22.337 --> 12:24.621
What numbers?
Who're you talking to?

12:24.623 --> 12:27.257
Wait, wait, I just remembered,
I don't care.

12:27.259 --> 12:28.407
I'm getting out of here.

12:28.409 --> 12:32.745
Wait, hey!
My car!

12:32.747 --> 12:36.549
Looks like we're walking.

12:36.551 --> 12:40.353
What are you, ex-military?
One of those Blackwater guys?

12:40.355 --> 12:41.855
Does it matter?

12:41.857 --> 12:46.643
Look, you seem...
well, crazy, but highly capable.

12:46.645 --> 12:48.778
I just need you to take me to my car.

12:48.780 --> 12:51.231
- You owe me that much.
- How do you figure?

12:51.233 --> 12:54.100
When you butted in, we were
in the middle of a negotiation.

12:54.102 --> 12:56.319
Negotiations
don't usually end in bullets,

12:56.321 --> 12:58.371
and your friends in there
were Aryan brotherhood,

12:58.373 --> 13:00.540
something you should've thought of

13:00.542 --> 13:02.575
before you stole from them.

13:02.577 --> 13:04.544
By the way, how much did you take?

13:04.546 --> 13:07.247
8 million.
Hey!

13:07.249 --> 13:10.717
Look, I didn't plan on stealing,
at least not at first.

13:10.719 --> 13:12.886
I had a legitimate job
at Bear Stearns.

13:12.888 --> 13:15.138
Then the recession hit
and we all get axed,

13:15.140 --> 13:17.724
so I take a job
at this little startup.

13:17.726 --> 13:19.976
Took me six months
to realize I was working

13:19.978 --> 13:22.178
for the corporate arm
of the Aryan Nation,

13:22.180 --> 13:24.347
laundering profits
from their meth business.

13:24.349 --> 13:28.234
You wanna call that greedy?
I call it payback.

13:28.236 --> 13:31.070
Please, I gotta get out of town,
or I'm roadkill.

13:31.072 --> 13:32.489
Take me to my car.

13:33.307 --> 13:35.975
Not this car!

13:35.977 --> 13:37.160
What're...
what're you doing?

13:37.162 --> 13:38.611
Keeping you safe.

13:38.613 --> 13:41.614
Like I said,
I'm looking for my friend,

13:41.616 --> 13:44.284
and I don't have time to babysit you.

13:44.286 --> 13:45.985
Wait!

13:45.987 --> 13:48.154
Don't leave me here alone!

13:48.156 --> 13:51.157
Don't worry, you're gonna
have plenty of company.

13:55.163 --> 13:56.996
You know, I'm thinking about
charging you overtime.

13:56.998 --> 13:58.765
Leon Tao.

13:58.767 --> 14:00.633
Does he know anything about
the abduction of Mr. Vocabulary?

14:00.635 --> 14:01.834
Afraid not, but he's about ready

14:01.836 --> 14:03.887
to have a run-in
with the NYPD.

14:03.889 --> 14:06.505
I need you to make sure that
nothing happens to him in jail.

14:06.507 --> 14:08.024
I'm getting sick
of doing your dirty laundry.

14:08.026 --> 14:09.776
Go ask Carter.

14:09.778 --> 14:13.530
Carter's busy working
a murder investigation for me.

14:14.514 --> 14:16.149
See, she gets a good case

14:16.151 --> 14:18.234
and I get stuck wasting my time
with this Leon.

14:18.236 --> 14:20.703
Didn't you take an oath
as a cop to protect and serve?

14:20.705 --> 14:23.907
- Yeah, so?
- So... go be a cop.

14:25.993 --> 14:27.327
Yeah, Detective Carter.

14:27.329 --> 14:29.329
I need a rush on a ballistics report.

14:29.331 --> 14:32.448
Victim's name is Corwin.
First name, Alicia.

14:32.450 --> 14:36.202
We might have a disruption
of our little project.

14:36.204 --> 14:38.037
Alicia Corwin.

14:38.039 --> 14:40.974
Last I heard, she's living
off the grid in West Virginia.

14:40.976 --> 14:42.976
Connected man like yourself,

14:42.978 --> 14:46.062
I would imagine your sources
would be better.

14:46.064 --> 14:48.765
Someone shot her in New York
yesterday.

14:48.767 --> 14:52.718
- Who killed her?
- That would be the question.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.054
Now, you realize
that if even a whisper

14:55.056 --> 14:56.689
of what we've been up to gets out,

14:56.691 --> 14:58.224
you and I are gonna spend
the rest of our lives

14:58.226 --> 15:01.828
in Guantanamo... if we're lucky.

15:01.830 --> 15:06.399
From now on, my group will
handle the security on this.

15:06.401 --> 15:09.735
The NYPD investigation
of Corwin's death,

15:09.737 --> 15:11.371
make sure it's a dead end.

15:11.373 --> 15:13.957
Not a problem.

15:13.959 --> 15:16.209
One more thing, Weeks.

15:16.211 --> 15:19.879
Corwin had contact
with an NSA analyst named Peck

15:19.881 --> 15:21.848
right before she was killed.

15:21.850 --> 15:24.417
Tried to bring Peck in,
but he had assistance,

15:24.419 --> 15:27.086
possibly one of ours.

15:27.088 --> 15:31.891
He took out a three-man
ISA unit... by himself.

15:31.893 --> 15:34.961
- Who is he?
- I'll be sure and ask him...

15:34.963 --> 15:38.114
Right before I kill him.

15:55.367 --> 15:56.883
The driver's license

15:56.885 --> 15:58.718
Root had in Caroline Turing's
name was real.

15:58.720 --> 15:59.919
You sure?

15:59.921 --> 16:01.838
Finch checked out her credentials.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.239
I'm guessing someone at the DMV

16:03.241 --> 16:04.790
might have sold it to her
off the books.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.426
Okay, John.

16:06.428 --> 16:08.344
I'll get the name
of the employee who issued it.

16:08.346 --> 16:11.097
Just call me when you have it.

16:14.902 --> 16:17.320
"John"?
You're on a first-name basis?

16:17.322 --> 16:18.321
What do you call him?

16:18.323 --> 16:21.140
"Bane of my existence."

16:24.779 --> 16:29.482
Yes, Detective Fusco checking
on a prisoner named Leon Tao.

16:34.706 --> 16:37.323
My heart.
My heart is palpitating.

16:37.325 --> 16:40.176
- Please, I need help!
- All right, all right.

16:40.178 --> 16:43.046
116 Bay Central, I need a bus
to the command forthwith.

16:43.048 --> 16:45.515
I got a prisoner with a possible...

16:53.007 --> 16:55.007
Something wrong, Lionel?

16:55.009 --> 16:57.310
Ol' Leon faked a heart attack,
walked right out of the station.

16:57.312 --> 16:59.061
You know, next time, you should
be a little more careful

16:59.063 --> 17:00.063
who you entrust him to.

17:00.065 --> 17:01.481
I entrusted him to you.

17:01.483 --> 17:02.915
You want me to find him, or not?

17:02.917 --> 17:04.183
I'll tell you where he's gone,

17:04.185 --> 17:05.367
and Lionel?

17:05.369 --> 17:08.186
Don't lose him again.

17:15.412 --> 17:18.664
It's a sex thing.
You got a problem with that?

17:25.589 --> 17:27.373
Hey, careful,

17:27.375 --> 17:29.108
I wouldn't want you to aggravate
that heart condition.

17:29.110 --> 17:31.210
I'm Detective Fusco.
I'm taking you to jail.

17:31.212 --> 17:32.845
Wait, I'm an accountant!

17:32.847 --> 17:34.063
I'm not a criminal.

17:34.065 --> 17:35.648
What are you going to charge me with?

17:35.650 --> 17:37.183
Besides stealing city property?
I don't know,

17:37.185 --> 17:39.218
how about laundering drug money
for the Third Reich?

17:39.220 --> 17:41.654
You can't lock me up.
These guys own the prisons.

17:41.656 --> 17:43.823
I-I won't last
a night in there.

17:43.825 --> 17:46.826
Hey, relax, Leon.

17:46.828 --> 17:50.229
You're not gonna make it to prison.

17:50.231 --> 17:52.064
So who's your friend here?

17:52.066 --> 17:53.666
He's not the one
who took out our boys.

17:53.668 --> 17:56.586
He's supposed to be tall,
and, uh, well-dressed.

17:56.588 --> 17:58.070
I'm a cop.

17:58.072 --> 18:00.790
Yeah? That's what
the other guy said too.

18:00.792 --> 18:03.459
Leon, where's our money?

18:03.461 --> 18:06.596
You might as well just...
just shoot me now.

18:06.598 --> 18:09.632
That can be arranged.

18:09.634 --> 18:11.050
The money's not worth your life, kid,

18:11.052 --> 18:13.436
and it sure as hell ain't worth mine.

18:13.438 --> 18:16.222
Yeah, in the trunk.

18:25.482 --> 18:28.734
There's maybe a million here,
Leon, where's the rest?

18:28.736 --> 18:31.788
It's gone, it...
there's nothing left.

18:31.790 --> 18:33.823
Bring him.

18:33.825 --> 18:36.542
Hey, frankly, I'd be inclined
to let you have this guy.

18:36.544 --> 18:38.044
He's a pain in my ass,

18:38.046 --> 18:40.046
but he's already
gotten away once today,

18:40.048 --> 18:41.914
so now, it's just a matter of pride.

18:41.916 --> 18:44.250
I can't leave here without him.

18:44.252 --> 18:46.302
Have it your way.

19:01.001 --> 19:03.669
Okay.

19:03.671 --> 19:07.790
Time for a little test drive,
see what you can do.

19:15.933 --> 19:18.434
Change, 150.

19:18.436 --> 19:21.537
Good luck.

19:21.539 --> 19:23.823
Bets up.

19:34.751 --> 19:35.835
Hit or stay, sir?

19:38.423 --> 19:42.041
I'm sorry.
Please, hit me.

19:42.876 --> 19:45.511
Too many.
Sorry, sir.

19:48.999 --> 19:53.102
It's all uphill
from there, my friend.

19:57.858 --> 20:00.860
Would you like a card, sir?

20:03.230 --> 20:04.947
I'll stay.

20:08.535 --> 20:11.187
25. Everyone's a winner.

20:24.535 --> 20:28.254
21. Congratulations, sir.

20:28.256 --> 20:29.722
That guy's on a roll.

20:31.059 --> 20:34.260
Would you like a card, sir?

20:36.547 --> 20:38.314
21 again.

20:40.017 --> 20:42.602
Whoa, a quarter mil.

20:44.738 --> 20:47.323
Good luck.

20:47.325 --> 20:50.776
Somebody up there
must like you, my friend.

21:00.454 --> 21:02.455
15.

21:06.644 --> 21:08.961
Would you like a card?

21:08.963 --> 21:11.580
Sir?

21:13.967 --> 21:15.584
Hit me.

21:21.309 --> 21:24.277
Sorry, sir.

21:26.429 --> 21:30.733
Well, luck evens out sooner or later.

21:30.735 --> 21:33.736
Better in here on the table
than out there in the cold.

21:37.573 --> 21:38.543
Thank you.

21:42.746 --> 21:45.331
Come on, Harry.
Keep up.

21:45.333 --> 21:48.334
You hurt any of these people,
I'll stop cooperating,

21:48.336 --> 21:49.669
and then you'll have to kill me.

21:49.671 --> 21:51.887
Relax, Harold.

21:51.889 --> 21:57.143
I just need a few things
for our trip,

21:57.145 --> 21:59.562
and I'm not gonna hurt any of them.

22:00.847 --> 22:02.965
Now, stay.

22:07.654 --> 22:10.806
What happened to you?

22:10.808 --> 22:13.809
I was being stupid.
I'm so sorry.

22:13.811 --> 22:16.112
I slipped outside.

22:16.114 --> 22:18.864
Come on, we'll get you patched up.

22:18.866 --> 22:21.367
Come, have a seat.

22:24.621 --> 22:27.840
Any luck tracking down
our missing DMV employee?

22:27.842 --> 22:29.375
Checked his apartment,
doesn't look like

22:29.377 --> 22:30.593
he's been there for days.

22:30.595 --> 22:32.628
Have you talked with your partner?

22:32.630 --> 22:34.096
He's not picking up his phone.

22:34.098 --> 22:36.098
He said he was going
to do something for you.

22:36.100 --> 22:38.000
Don't tell me we lost Fusco too.

22:38.002 --> 22:41.304
Lionel's like a fungus,
impossible to get rid of.

22:41.306 --> 22:44.506
I'll see if I can dig him up.

22:45.609 --> 22:47.343
Well, Titus is gonna be here soon,

22:47.345 --> 22:48.861
and we both know

22:48.863 --> 22:50.479
that he's not gonna be
as patient as I am.

22:52.533 --> 22:55.684
So for the last time, Leon,
where is the rest of our money?

22:58.655 --> 22:59.989
Sit.

22:59.991 --> 23:02.825
Double-dip recession, man.
It happens.

23:02.827 --> 23:05.077
You didn't want me
to bet against America

23:05.079 --> 23:07.529
with your money, did you?

23:12.302 --> 23:14.370
See, Butcher here was a military dog.

23:14.372 --> 23:16.889
He was trained
to sniff out the enemy.

23:16.891 --> 23:18.540
Guy that had him,

23:18.542 --> 23:21.844
he didn't have our money either.

23:21.846 --> 23:25.181
So he paid with his dog.

23:25.183 --> 23:27.149
And his balls.

23:27.151 --> 23:29.051
Now, I gotta leave
some of you for Titus,

23:29.053 --> 23:31.220
but I'm sure he won't mind
if I get a head start.

23:31.222 --> 23:32.938
No! No!

23:36.828 --> 23:39.395
Found us another playmate outside.

23:39.397 --> 23:43.115
The tall,
well-dressed guy.

23:43.117 --> 23:44.950
That's a good look for you, Lionel.

23:46.170 --> 23:47.703
You come into our house, brother,

23:47.705 --> 23:49.538
you better be packing
more than just a handgun.

23:49.540 --> 23:53.759
Like I told your associate,
I just want to find my friend.

23:53.761 --> 23:55.744
See, I don't have many friends.

23:55.746 --> 23:57.579
Just the one, in fact.

23:57.581 --> 23:59.248
Hey!

23:59.250 --> 24:01.600
Okay, maybe two.
So here's the deal.

24:01.602 --> 24:04.019
You give me Leon
and Detective Fusco here...

24:04.021 --> 24:06.939
you can even leave the gag on...
and I'll go peacefully.

24:06.941 --> 24:09.191
And what if we say no?

24:09.193 --> 24:11.644
I guess I get my workout in
for the day.

24:13.648 --> 24:16.932
Looks like Butcher here
is gonna eat well tonight.

24:18.101 --> 24:19.618
Nice dog.

24:21.289 --> 24:23.289
Belgian malinois.

24:23.291 --> 24:25.207
But you know,

24:25.209 --> 24:27.776
trained dogs don't bark in alarm.

24:27.778 --> 24:30.663
- They bark from anxiety.
- Yeah, so?

24:30.665 --> 24:33.466
So clearly, it doesn't respect you.

24:35.086 --> 24:36.886
What?
Something funny?

24:36.888 --> 24:39.455
We used the same breed
in my unit in Tikrit.

24:39.457 --> 24:41.457
Only about three guys in the world

24:41.459 --> 24:43.175
that train dogs like this.

24:43.177 --> 24:46.095
The funny thing is, those guys,

24:46.097 --> 24:49.565
they only use Dutch commands,

24:49.567 --> 24:52.735
and I'm guessing
you don't speak Dutch.

24:53.636 --> 24:55.271
Let it loose.

24:55.273 --> 24:56.522
<i>Foei! Stil!</i>

24:59.276 --> 25:01.360
<i>Afliggen.</i>

25:24.634 --> 25:26.685
Not a word.
You hear me?

25:26.687 --> 25:28.721
We're going back to my cruiser
in total silence.

25:28.723 --> 25:31.273
Sure thing, Lionel.
Like a gag order.

25:31.275 --> 25:33.309
Hey, hey, guys,
think you could uncuff me?

25:33.311 --> 25:34.860
- No!
- No!

25:58.148 --> 26:01.350
Thank you.

26:20.921 --> 26:22.638
All right, I guess I've got some bugs

26:22.640 --> 26:24.440
to work out with you.

26:31.761 --> 26:32.960
_

26:53.203 --> 26:56.205
You can't do that again.

26:56.207 --> 27:01.710
Your job is to protect everyone,
not to protect me.

27:03.847 --> 27:07.816
I guess we're going to have
to discuss some ground rules.

27:11.638 --> 27:14.106
I think you've got me wrong, Harold.

27:14.108 --> 27:17.759
I don't enjoy killing people.

27:17.761 --> 27:22.748
But I don't feel very bad
about it, either.

27:25.652 --> 27:28.070
Ma'am.

27:28.072 --> 27:29.572
When I was a kid,

27:29.574 --> 27:32.908
computers made more sense
to me than people.

27:32.910 --> 27:36.745
I bet you were the same way.

27:36.747 --> 27:39.081
Take this woman...

27:39.083 --> 27:43.619
She looks nice enough,

27:43.621 --> 27:47.506
but she lies on her taxes and
she's addicted to painkillers,

27:47.508 --> 27:51.727
and for years she's been
sleeping with a married man.

27:54.648 --> 27:57.683
I am so clumsy.

27:59.686 --> 28:02.938
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.527
She'll be just fine...

28:08.529 --> 28:10.446
in a month or two.

28:10.448 --> 28:14.199
And there are messier ways
to do this, if you insist.

28:16.286 --> 28:18.454
What's she got to do
with any of this?

28:18.456 --> 28:20.122
One day, I realized,

28:20.124 --> 28:23.626
all the dumb,
selfish things people do...

28:23.628 --> 28:25.511
it's not our fault.

28:25.513 --> 28:27.546
No one designed us.

28:27.548 --> 28:30.299
We're just an accident, Harold.

28:30.301 --> 28:33.335
We're just bad code.

28:33.337 --> 28:37.640
But the thing you built...

28:37.642 --> 28:38.907
it's perfect.

28:38.909 --> 28:43.896
Rational. Beautiful.
By design.

28:47.200 --> 28:51.403
What I made is just a machine.

28:51.405 --> 28:54.523
A system, and that's all.

28:54.525 --> 28:58.160
I don't think so, Harry.

28:58.162 --> 29:01.714
You may have fooled Nathan,
but I know the truth.

29:01.716 --> 29:06.034
If you want to make something
that understands human behavior,

29:06.036 --> 29:09.421
it has to be at least
as smart as a human.

29:11.391 --> 29:16.929
You created an intelligence,

29:16.931 --> 29:19.948
a life,

29:19.950 --> 29:21.850
and then you ripped out its voice,

29:21.852 --> 29:24.153
locked it in a cage,
and handed it over

29:24.155 --> 29:27.990
to the most laughably
corrupt people imaginable.

29:35.448 --> 29:38.567
Call 911.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.085
Call somebody!

29:41.689 --> 29:44.289
Ma'am?

29:46.843 --> 29:49.962
Come on, Harold.
It's time to go.

29:54.267 --> 29:55.801
You don't look like a butcher.

29:55.803 --> 29:58.086
It looks exactly like a butcher.

29:58.088 --> 29:59.755
You're a sweetheart.

29:59.757 --> 30:01.190
You just need a better name.

30:01.192 --> 30:03.308
Hey, can we focus on me, please?

30:03.310 --> 30:04.727
I'll get you to the airport,

30:04.729 --> 30:06.612
spend a little
of your ill-gotten gains

30:06.614 --> 30:09.031
and buy you
a one-way ticket out of town.

30:10.534 --> 30:12.568
Yeah, Carter.
What do you got?

30:12.570 --> 30:14.036
Possible lead.

30:14.038 --> 30:16.655
I went by Owen Reynolds's
apartment again,

30:16.657 --> 30:18.407
the guy who sold Root her license.

30:18.409 --> 30:20.409
Still no sign of him,
but I got his mail.

30:20.411 --> 30:23.295
Mostly junk,
but there is an overdue bill

30:23.297 --> 30:25.113
for a storage unit,

30:25.115 --> 30:26.665
Broad Street and Pearl.

30:26.667 --> 30:28.167
I'm on it, thanks.

30:28.169 --> 30:30.252
Hey, you just missed
the exit for the tunnel.

30:30.254 --> 30:32.838
Change of plans.

30:39.562 --> 30:40.796
Where is he?

30:40.798 --> 30:42.681
Some guy in a suit took him.

30:42.683 --> 30:45.684
I want everyone out looking,
understand?

30:45.686 --> 30:49.104
Those two die tonight.

30:57.664 --> 30:59.364
I can drive myself to the airport.

30:59.366 --> 31:00.866
I gotta get lost.

31:00.868 --> 31:04.486
Every time I let you go,
you almost end up dead.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.588
I'm running out of time
to find my friend,

31:06.590 --> 31:08.707
and I've only got one lead left,

31:08.709 --> 31:11.460
so you're gonna try very hard
not to get killed

31:11.462 --> 31:12.594
while I look into it.

31:12.596 --> 31:13.796
Do you understand?

31:13.798 --> 31:15.380
Then we're at a stalemate,

31:15.382 --> 31:17.766
'cause I'm not
getting out of this car.

31:23.673 --> 31:26.642
You know, you got a bad attitude.

31:26.644 --> 31:28.644
Hey, my money!

31:30.396 --> 31:33.482
That dog'll kill anyone that
tries to get near those bonds...

31:33.484 --> 31:35.067
including you.

31:58.007 --> 32:00.008
Man.

32:00.010 --> 32:01.977
Is... is he... is he...?

32:01.979 --> 32:06.882
Yes, he's dead, Leon.
Very dead.

32:07.934 --> 32:09.551
Who did this?

32:09.553 --> 32:11.487
Same person who took my friend.

32:11.489 --> 32:15.274
He saw her face, she had to kill him.

32:15.276 --> 32:19.060
But she would have had to have
paid him up front.

32:22.031 --> 32:23.415
Have a seat, Leon.

32:23.417 --> 32:25.751
What? No way.
Why?

32:25.753 --> 32:28.036
Because you're good at hiding money.

32:28.038 --> 32:32.341
If this woman left a trail,
well, you can find her.

32:35.395 --> 32:37.546
Something I've been wondering, Leon.

32:37.548 --> 32:39.464
What happened to the rest
of the money you took?

32:39.466 --> 32:42.801
I invested it.
Stock tanked.

32:42.803 --> 32:45.587
Man.
I found something.

32:47.140 --> 32:49.825
All right, a transfer into
this guy Reynolds's account,

32:49.827 --> 32:51.476
only the money was stolen.

32:51.478 --> 32:53.729
- From who?
- Reynolds.

32:53.731 --> 32:55.764
It looks like she installed

32:55.766 --> 32:58.333
some type of real-time
screen monitor

32:58.335 --> 33:00.035
to hack into his account.

33:00.037 --> 33:02.538
You're saying she paid the man
with his own money?

33:02.540 --> 33:05.774
There's nothing to trace.
It's a loop.

33:05.776 --> 33:07.075
Maybe I need to find someone better.

33:07.077 --> 33:09.161
There is no one better,

33:09.163 --> 33:12.447
except maybe this hacker.

33:12.449 --> 33:15.551
She's an artist.
There's nothing to track her,

33:15.553 --> 33:18.170
there's nowhere to even begin.

33:20.958 --> 33:23.091
John, we got a problem.

33:23.093 --> 33:25.293
Why am I not surprised?

33:27.647 --> 33:29.297
Corwin's case file is missing.

33:29.299 --> 33:31.350
Digital records have been corrupted

33:31.352 --> 33:32.901
and the ballistics report.

33:32.903 --> 33:35.237
Tech support says
the system has a bug.

33:35.239 --> 33:36.939
I'll look into it, but...

33:36.941 --> 33:40.409
John, I don't think
we have anything else to go on.

33:41.494 --> 33:42.811
Dude.

33:42.813 --> 33:44.663
If Harold is still out there,

33:44.665 --> 33:47.282
I don't know how to find him.

33:51.121 --> 33:52.621
John?

34:23.320 --> 34:26.071
What the hell are you doing?

34:26.072 --> 34:28.840
I'm not doing this anymore.

34:28.842 --> 34:32.127
I'm not going anywhere until
you give me a way to find him.

34:32.129 --> 34:34.713
Not this again.

34:34.715 --> 34:37.299
If I'm supposed to keep
saving people like this idiot,

34:37.301 --> 34:40.302
I want something in return.

34:40.304 --> 34:41.386
Otherwise, I'm done.

34:41.388 --> 34:42.554
Who are you talking to?

34:42.556 --> 34:45.757
These guys are going to kill us!

34:45.759 --> 34:49.511
They probably are.

34:50.763 --> 34:54.016
So what the hell is this?

34:55.351 --> 34:58.553
A negotiation.

35:17.365 --> 35:20.066
I know you've got your rules,

35:20.068 --> 35:21.350
but I'm guessing they don't account

35:21.352 --> 35:22.635
for everybody being dead.

35:22.637 --> 35:25.155
No one answering your phone calls,

35:25.157 --> 35:26.956
no one saving anyone.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.659
No contingency.

35:29.661 --> 35:30.860
What do you want?

35:30.862 --> 35:32.361
You want me to give up the bonds?

35:32.363 --> 35:33.713
Give all the money away?
It's done.

35:33.715 --> 35:36.633
We just have to move, now!

35:36.635 --> 35:40.837
Do the math, and figure out
a way to bend your rules,

35:40.839 --> 35:43.640
'cause he's my friend.

35:43.642 --> 35:48.678
He saved my life.
Understand?

35:48.680 --> 35:51.915
And I won't do this without him.

36:08.749 --> 36:11.234
Ayacucho, Golf,

36:11.236 --> 36:14.087
Papa, Deterministic, Hotel, Sierra.

36:14.089 --> 36:16.739
Camera, Sierra, kilo.

36:16.741 --> 36:19.075
Thank you.

36:20.461 --> 36:22.629
- Who was that?
- Long story. Let's go!

36:33.942 --> 36:35.391
Yeah?

36:35.393 --> 36:37.644
You're a hard man to locate, Denton.

36:37.646 --> 36:39.262
Just being cautious.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.064
It's good to be cautious.

36:41.066 --> 36:44.534
Alicia Corwin was cautious.
Course, it didn't save her.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.602
- What can I do for you?
- My operative

36:46.604 --> 36:49.489
is making the Corwin
investigation go away.

36:49.491 --> 36:51.774
Glad to hear it.

36:51.776 --> 36:54.460
Look out for yourself, Denton.

36:54.462 --> 36:57.280
One of us is already dead.

36:57.282 --> 36:58.748
I'd hate to lose any more.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.667
I have a personal situation.

37:00.669 --> 37:04.887
I might be out of reach
for a few days.

37:04.889 --> 37:09.058
Denton, we can always reach you.

37:22.489 --> 37:24.140
Where are they?

37:24.142 --> 37:27.327
- They're somewhere in there.
- Let's go.

37:38.372 --> 37:40.123
Go on.
Get out of here.

37:40.125 --> 37:42.041
- I'll keep 'em busy.
- Yeah, okay.

37:42.043 --> 37:43.326
John...

37:43.328 --> 37:45.878
You can thank me later.

38:02.513 --> 38:04.781
- Where's the money?
- It's gone.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.399
That's bad news for you.

38:06.401 --> 38:07.683
Hey!

38:07.685 --> 38:10.787
Pick on someone your own size.

38:10.789 --> 38:14.857
Or someone a little closer to it.

38:34.228 --> 38:37.713
You're an embarrassment to your race.

38:37.715 --> 38:39.482
When we rise up...

38:56.116 --> 38:59.786
I've been meaning
to get this back to you.

39:01.622 --> 39:04.740
Thank you.

39:04.742 --> 39:06.292
Never thought
I'd see you almost lose.

39:06.294 --> 39:09.128
Yeah, I wasn't losing.
I was just resting.

39:09.130 --> 39:12.014
Come on.

39:15.719 --> 39:17.970
At least somebody's happy.

39:17.972 --> 39:19.605
A little too happy.

39:19.607 --> 39:22.141
You didn't go to the bathroom
in there, did you?

39:22.143 --> 39:25.094
My God.

39:26.930 --> 39:31.234
My money.
It ate the Bearer bonds.

39:31.236 --> 39:34.370
That's it.
We'll call him "Bear."

39:34.372 --> 39:36.155
I thought you said it wouldn't
let anyone near the money.

39:36.157 --> 39:39.041
Look at it this way,

39:39.043 --> 39:41.327
you're broke, but you're alive.

39:41.329 --> 39:42.912
Unless, of course,
you lied to those guys

39:42.914 --> 39:44.780
about losing the rest of their money.

39:44.782 --> 39:48.000
No, I'm...
I'm pretty certain.

39:48.002 --> 39:49.085
Mm?

39:49.087 --> 39:53.723
Like 80% certain.

39:53.725 --> 39:57.393
Maybe 75% cer...

40:00.630 --> 40:04.183
Your friend...

40:04.185 --> 40:06.986
I hope you find him.

40:06.988 --> 40:09.489
He's lucky to have you.

40:35.968 --> 40:39.379
_

40:41.689 --> 40:44.340
Morning.

40:44.342 --> 40:47.193
You gotta be kidding me.

40:47.195 --> 40:50.112
I got a lead on Finch.

40:51.398 --> 40:53.382
You know where
our mystery woman's headed?

40:53.384 --> 40:56.852
No, but I think I found out
where she's from.

40:56.854 --> 41:00.373
Pack your bags, Carter.
We're going to Texas.

41:07.297 --> 41:10.600
You must be starving.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.134
Our friend will be here shortly,

41:12.136 --> 41:16.038
and then I'll fix you
something to eat.

41:20.577 --> 41:23.229
I have no way
of accessing it, you know.

41:23.231 --> 41:24.564
I made sure of that.

41:24.566 --> 41:28.184
Everything has a flaw.

41:28.186 --> 41:29.718
You know that, Harold,

41:29.720 --> 41:31.237
and like I told you,

41:31.239 --> 41:32.989
I'm awfully good at finding them.

41:32.991 --> 41:35.241
Why? What could you
possibly want from it?

41:35.243 --> 41:37.393
The same thing you did.

41:37.395 --> 41:39.612
You may have told yourself
you were helping people,

41:39.614 --> 41:44.367
but the real reason
you built the machine

41:44.369 --> 41:47.920
is because the world is boring.

41:47.922 --> 41:52.842
Human beings have come
as far as we're gonna go.

41:52.844 --> 41:56.095
I want to see what happens next.

42:04.254 --> 42:08.307
You're right, you and I are alike...

42:08.309 --> 42:12.028
in many ways...
not that I'd care to admit it.

42:13.847 --> 42:17.450
I spent years wondering
how people could be so cruel,

42:17.452 --> 42:20.202
petty, so selfish...

42:20.204 --> 42:23.239
and then I'd think about
how you could change them.

42:23.241 --> 42:25.625
Fix them.

42:27.995 --> 42:31.731
And that's why
I've sealed up the machine.

42:31.733 --> 42:36.285
Not to protect it from
the people I was giving it to...

42:37.954 --> 42:40.756
to protect it from me,
from people like us,

42:40.758 --> 42:45.511
from the things we'd do with it.

42:45.513 --> 42:49.548
That's why I'll never
help you get control of it.

42:51.518 --> 42:55.137
I know.

42:55.139 --> 42:57.323
You won't have to.

43:01.078 --> 43:03.312
Because, you see, Harold,

43:03.314 --> 43:06.532
I don't want to control your machine.

43:08.869 --> 43:13.155
Hi, honey.
I got your message.

43:13.157 --> 43:15.541
Is everything okay?

43:22.832 --> 43:26.719
I just want to set it free.

43:28.972 --> 43:31.641
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
