00:48.422 --> 00:53.177
Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.

00:53.427 --> 01:02.019
But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort,
which could only be broken by Love's first kiss.

01:02.270 --> 01:08.609
She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible
fire breathing dragon.

01:08.860 --> 01:15.992
Many brave knights had attempted to free her from
this dreadful prison, but none prevailed.

01:16.242 --> 01:23.040
She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest
room of the tallest tower for her true love

01:23.291 --> 01:27.253
and true love's first kiss.

01:27.503 --> 01:29.714
Like that's ever going to happen.

01:29.964 --> 01:34.552
What a loony.

01:51.485 --> 01:57.658
Shrek

02:45.081 --> 02:47.752
Beware

03:16.903 --> 03:18.157
Stay out

03:38.092 --> 03:39.552
I think he's in here.

03:39.802 --> 03:40.845
All right. Lets get it!

03:41.095 --> 03:43.848
Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

03:44.098 --> 03:48.394
Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains.

03:48.644 --> 03:51.981
Well actually that would be a giant.

03:52.231 --> 03:55.234
Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse.

03:55.484 --> 03:59.655
They'll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin.

03:59.906 --> 04:03.576
They'll chew your livers,
squeeze the jelly from your eyes.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.286
Actually, it's quite good on toast.

04:05.536 --> 04:07.788
Back, back beast, back!

04:08.039 --> 04:12.335
I warned you!

04:13.503 --> 04:17.798
Right.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.774
This is the part, where you run away.

04:35.024 --> 04:39.320
Yeah!

04:41.280 --> 04:45.868
And stay out.

04:46.744 --> 04:52.250
Wanted. Fairytale creatures.

04:55.586 --> 05:01.342
Right, this one is full. Take it away.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.137
Give me that.

05:05.388 --> 05:08.099
Your fine days are over.
-25 pieces of silver for the witch.

05:08.349 --> 05:13.396
Next.
-Come on.

05:13.646 --> 05:17.567
Sit down there! And be quiet!

05:17.817 --> 05:19.986
This cage is so small.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.488
You wouldn't turn me in.
I'll never be stubborn again. I can change.

05:22.738 --> 05:24.031
Please, give me another chance.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.033
Oh, shut up!

05:26.284 --> 05:27.076
Next.

05:27.326 --> 05:27.827
What do we got?

05:28.077 --> 05:29.620
This little wooden puppet.

05:29.871 --> 05:35.042
I'm not a puppet, I'm a real boy.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.420
Five shillings for the possessed toy.
Take it away.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.463
No! Please, don't let them do it!

05:39.714 --> 05:41.090
Next. What do you got?

05:41.340 --> 05:44.385
Well, I've got a talking donkey!

05:44.635 --> 05:45.469
Right.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.723
Well that's good for ten schillings,
if you can prove it.

05:48.973 --> 05:53.519
Oh, go ahead fella.

05:53.769 --> 05:54.896
Well?

05:55.146 --> 05:57.398
He's just a li..., just a little nervous.

05:57.648 --> 06:00.109
He's really quite a chatterbox.

06:00.359 --> 06:01.402
You boneheaded donkey!

06:01.652 --> 06:02.862
That's it. I have heard enough. Guards!

06:03.112 --> 06:05.907
No, no, he talks, he does!

06:06.157 --> 06:08.618
I can talk. I love to talk.

06:08.868 --> 06:12.413
I've talked to...

06:12.663 --> 06:18.544
Get her out of my sight!
-No, no, I swear!

06:22.173 --> 06:24.884
Hey, I can fly.
-He can fly! -He can fly!

06:25.134 --> 06:27.762
He can talk!
-That's right, fool!

06:28.012 --> 06:30.806
Now I'm a flying, talking donkey!

06:31.057 --> 06:32.850
You might have seen house fly,
maybe even a superfly.

06:33.100 --> 06:39.941
But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly!

06:42.860 --> 06:47.156
Seize him!

06:57.708 --> 07:03.589
Get him! This way! Hurry!

07:05.800 --> 07:09.804
You there. Ogre.
-I.

07:10.054 --> 07:11.597
By the order of lord Farquaad.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.183
I am authorized to place you
both under arrest.

07:14.433 --> 07:20.439
And transport you to designated
resettlement facility.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.149
Oh really?

07:22.400 --> 07:27.238
You and what army?

07:35.705 --> 07:37.248
Can I say something to you?

07:37.498 --> 07:40.751
Listen, you were really, really something,
back there. Incredible.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.963
Are you talking to...

07:44.213 --> 07:46.382
...me?

07:46.632 --> 07:47.842
Yes, I was talking to you.

07:48.092 --> 07:50.644
Can I just tell you that you were
really great back there with those guards.

07:50.795 --> 07:51.721
They thought that was all over there.

07:51.971 --> 07:55.683
And then you showed up and BAM. There was tripping
on over themselves like babes in the woods.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.468
That really made me feel good to see that.

07:57.518 --> 07:58.769
Oh, that's great. Really.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.062
Man, it's good to be free.

08:00.313 --> 08:06.135
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom
with your own friends?

08:06.485 --> 08:07.904
But I...

08:08.154 --> 08:09.488
I don't have any friends.

08:09.739 --> 08:12.116
And I'm not going out there by myself.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.618
Hey wait a minute. I have a great idea...

08:13.868 --> 08:15.077
I'll stick with you.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.454
You and me in green fighting machine.

08:16.704 --> 08:22.110
Together we'll scare the spin if anybody crosses us.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.088
Oh, a, that was really scary.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.709
Maybe you don't mine me saying. If that don't work,
your breath will certainly do the job done, 'cause...

08:29.759 --> 08:32.111
you definitively need some tic-tac or something,

08:32.260 --> 08:34.722
'cause your breath stinks!

08:34.972 --> 08:36.474
Man you've ???  my note!

08:36.724 --> 08:39.268
Just like the time...

08:39.519 --> 08:40.852
...and then I ate some rotten berries.

08:41.102 --> 08:43.188
Man I had some strong gases leaking
out of my but that day.

08:43.438 --> 08:47.026
Why are you following me?

08:47.276 --> 08:50.446
I'll tell you why.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.657
'Cause I'm all alone,

08:52.907 --> 08:56.786
there is no one here, beside me.

08:57.036 --> 09:04.001
My problems have all gone.
There's no one to derive me.

09:04.252 --> 09:09.006
But you got to have free ...
-Stop singing!

09:09.257 --> 09:11.801
Well, it's no wonder, you don't have any friends.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.628
Wow! Only a true friend would be that truly honest.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.222
Listen! Little donkey.

09:16.472 --> 09:20.434
Take a look at me! What am I?

09:20.685 --> 09:23.771
A...

09:24.021 --> 09:24.689
...really tall?

09:24.939 --> 09:30.278
No! I'm an Ogre.
You know, grab your torch and pitchforks.

09:30.528 --> 09:33.573
Doesn't that bother you?

09:33.823 --> 09:35.491
Nope.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.785
Really?
-Really really.

09:38.035 --> 09:38.828
Oh?

09:39.078 --> 09:41.080
Man, I like you. What's your name?

09:41.330 --> 09:44.500
A..., Shrek.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.169
Shrek?!

09:46.419 --> 09:47.378
But do you know, what I like about you, Shrek?

09:47.628 --> 09:50.381
You've got that kind of:
"I don't care what nobody thinks of me" thing.

09:50.631 --> 09:55.970
I like that, I respect that, Shrek. You're all right.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.847
Uh, look at that.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.141
Who would wanna live in
a place like that?

10:00.391 --> 10:02.602
That would be my home.

10:02.852 --> 10:07.607
Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful.
You know you're quite a decorator.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.276
It's amazing what you did with such a modest budget.

10:10.526 --> 10:16.741
I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.454
I guess, you don't entertain much, do you?

10:21.704 --> 10:23.539
I like my privacy.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.833
You know I do to.
That's another thing, we have in common.

10:26.083 --> 10:29.170
Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face.
You try to give them a hint and they won't leave.

10:29.420 --> 10:34.842
And then there's that big occurred silence,
you know?

10:35.801 --> 10:38.221
Can I stay with you?
-What?

10:38.471 --> 10:40.848
Can I stay with you, please.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.184
Of course!
-Really?

10:43.434 --> 10:45.770
No.
-Please! I don't want to go back there.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.147
You don't how is like to be concerned like a freak.

10:48.397 --> 10:50.942
Well..., maybe you do.
But that's why we have to stick together!

10:51.192 --> 10:53.277
You got to let me stay! Please! Please!

10:53.528 --> 10:55.613
OK, OK.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.199
-But one night only.
-Huh, thank you!

10:58.449 --> 10:59.617
A, what are you do... No!

10:59.867 --> 11:02.453
This is going to be fun.
We can stay up late, swap the manly stories.

11:02.703 --> 11:03.829
And in the morning...

11:04.080 --> 11:06.999
I'm making waffles.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.001
Where do I sleep?

11:09.252 --> 11:11.754
Outside!

11:12.004 --> 11:15.716
Oh, a, I guess that's cool. You know,
I don't know you and you don't know me...

11:15.967 --> 11:19.470
... so I guess, outside is best for me.

11:19.720 --> 11:24.016
Here I go.

11:24.267 --> 11:28.145
Good night.

11:28.396 --> 11:32.066
I do like that half door.
I'm a donkey all alone outside.

11:32.316 --> 11:37.280
Sit by myself outside, I guess.

11:37.363 --> 11:45.454
I'm all alone, there's no one here beside me.

12:46.974 --> 12:53.564
-I thought, I told you to stay outside.
-I am outside.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.489
Well James. This is far from the farm,
but what choice do we have?

13:01.739 --> 13:05.076
It's not...

13:05.326 --> 13:07.620
What a lovely bed.
-Got you!

13:07.870 --> 13:13.292
I found some cheese. Awful stuff.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.586
-Is that you Gordon?
-How did you know?

13:15.837 --> 13:21.876
Enough! What are you doing in my house?

13:22.260 --> 13:24.887
Oh, no, no, no... Death prods off the table!

13:25.137 --> 13:30.560
Where would we supposed to put her.
The bed's taken.

13:31.686 --> 13:32.478
What?

13:32.728 --> 13:37.900
I live in a swamp. I've put up signs.
I'm a terrifying Ogre!

13:38.150 --> 13:44.282
What do I have to do, to get a little privacy?

13:44.532 --> 13:51.747
Oh, no! No, no!

13:59.422 --> 14:05.678
What are you doing in my swamp?

14:10.766 --> 14:14.270
All right, get out of here. All of you.
Move it! Come on, let's go.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.023
And hurry up, hurry up.

14:17.273 --> 14:23.154
No, no, not there. Not there!

14:24.280 --> 14:26.824
Hey don't look at me. I didn't invite them.

14:27.074 --> 14:29.702
Oh gosh, no one invited us.
-What?

14:29.952 --> 14:32.330
We were forced to come here.
-By who?

14:32.580 --> 14:37.043
Lord Farquaad. He ???

14:39.504 --> 14:40.838
All right.

14:41.088 --> 14:46.302
Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?

14:46.552 --> 14:48.554
Oh I do. I know where he is.

14:48.804 --> 14:53.809
Does anyone else know where to find him?

14:54.060 --> 14:56.604
-Anyone at all? -Me. -Anyone?

14:56.854 --> 15:00.650
Oh pick me, I know! Me, me.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.236
Ok, fine.

15:03.486 --> 15:08.366
Attention all fairy tale things!

15:08.616 --> 15:12.411
Do not get comfortable.
Your welcome is officially warned up.

15:12.662 --> 15:23.256
In fact. I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now
and get all off my land and back where you came from.

15:29.095 --> 15:33.057
You. You're coming with me.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.475
All right. That's what I like to hear, man.

15:34.725 --> 15:40.565
Shrek and Donkey, two stubborn friends off on a
world and big city adventure. I love it.

15:40.815 --> 15:46.195
I'm on road again. Sing with me Shrek!
I'm on road again...

15:46.445 --> 15:48.573
What did I say about singing?

15:48.823 --> 15:49.699
-Can I whistle?
-No.

15:49.949 --> 15:55.037
-Well, can I hummer?
-All right.

16:22.523 --> 16:28.529
That's enough. He's ready to talk.

16:38.915 --> 16:42.418
Run, run, run as fast as you can,
you can't catch me.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.837
I'm the gingerbread man.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.297
You monster.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.132
I'm not a monster here. You are.

16:48.382 --> 16:52.887
You and the rest of that fairytale trash,
poisoning my perfect world.

16:53.137 --> 16:57.391
-Now tell me! Where are the others?
-Eat me.

16:57.642 --> 17:02.188
I've tried to be fair to you, creatures.
Now my patience has reached its end!

17:02.438 --> 17:05.148
-Tell me! Or I'll...
-No, no, not the buttons.

17:05.398 --> 17:07.108
Not gumdrop buttons.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.278
All right! Who's hiding them?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.781
Ok, I'll tell you.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.076
-Do you know the muffin-man?
-The muffin-man?

17:15.326 --> 17:18.746
-The muffin-man.
-Yes, I know the muffin-man.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.705
Who lives on Proully lane?

17:20.957 --> 17:24.417
-Well, she's married to the muffin-man.
-The muffin-man!

17:24.669 --> 17:28.840
-The muffin-man!
-She's married to the muffin-man.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.050
My lord! We found it.

17:31.300 --> 17:36.889
Well then, what are you waiting for?
Bring it in.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.319
Magic mirror.

17:50.570 --> 17:55.616
Don't tell him anything!

17:56.742 --> 17:58.578
Evening.

17:58.828 --> 18:04.083
Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all?

18:04.333 --> 18:07.378
Well, technically, you're not a king.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.089
A..., felonious.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.133
-You were saying.
-What I mean is a...

18:12.383 --> 18:13.593
...you're not a king, yet.

18:13.843 --> 18:18.598
But you can become one.
All you have to do, is marry a princess.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.766
Go on.

18:21.017 --> 18:23.978
So, just sit back and relax my lord,

18:24.228 --> 18:29.066
because it's time for you
to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.

18:29.317 --> 18:32.320
And here they are.

18:32.570 --> 18:36.949
Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused
shading from a kingdom far, far away.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.619
She likes sushi and hottubbing anytime.

18:39.869 --> 18:43.080
Her hobbies include cooking and
cleaning for two evil sisters.

18:43.331 --> 18:46.250
Please welcome... Cinderella.

18:46.501 --> 18:49.504
Bachelorette number two is a
 kemp wearing girl from a land of fantasy.

18:49.754 --> 18:52.590
Although she lives with seven other man,
she is not easy.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.302
Just kiss hers dead frozen lips
and find out what a live wife she is.

18:56.552 --> 19:00.389
Come on. Give it up for... Show-white.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.558
And last but certainly not least.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.477
Bachelorette number three is a
fire-breathing ????,

19:04.727 --> 19:08.940
dragon guarded castle, surrounded by a hot
boiling lava. But don't let that cool you off.

19:09.190 --> 19:12.860
She's a loaded pistol who likes
Pina Coladas and getting cut in the rain.

19:13.110 --> 19:17.198
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona.

19:17.448 --> 19:21.577
So will it be, bachelorette number one?
Bachelorette number two?

19:21.827 --> 19:23.955
Or bachelorette number three?

19:24.205 --> 19:27.625
-Two... -Three! -Two!

19:27.875 --> 19:29.544
One. No, no, no.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.879
Three. Pick number three my lord.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.966
Ok, ok. Number three.

19:35.216 --> 19:43.516
Lord Farquaad. You've chosen...
princess Fiona.

19:45.142 --> 19:49.564
She's nice. Fiona. She's perfect.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.858
All I have to do is just find someone...

19:52.108 --> 19:54.694
But I probably should mention little thing
that happens at night...

19:54.944 --> 19:56.445
-I'll do it!
-Yes, but after sunset...

19:56.696 --> 19:58.197
Silence!

19:58.447 --> 20:00.658
I will make this princess Fiona my queen.

20:00.908 --> 20:04.996
And Duloc will finally have the perfect king!

20:05.246 --> 20:07.456
Captain! Assemble your finest man.

20:07.707 --> 20:13.337
We're going to have a tournament!

20:14.463 --> 20:16.340
That's it, that's, right there, that's Duloc.

20:16.591 --> 20:18.009
I've told you I'll find it.

20:18.259 --> 20:22.930
So. That must be lord Farquaad's castle.

20:23.181 --> 20:25.099
Aha, that's the place.

20:25.349 --> 20:30.688
Do you think maybe he's compensating for something.

20:32.815 --> 20:37.528
Hey, hey wait up Shrek!

20:39.238 --> 20:41.532
-Hey, you!
-No, no!

20:41.782 --> 20:43.451
Wait a second.

20:43.701 --> 20:49.540
Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just...

21:20.279 --> 21:24.116
It's quiet.

21:24.367 --> 21:28.538
Too quiet.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.457
Where is everybody?

21:31.707 --> 21:36.212
Hey look at this.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.717
Wow!

22:22.967 --> 22:28.514
-Let's do that again.
-No. no.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.902
All right.
You're going the right way for smack bottom.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.404
Sorry about that.

22:43.654 --> 22:46.657
That champion should have the honor, no, no...

22:46.908 --> 22:56.167
...the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely
princess Fiona from the fireing keep of the dragon.

22:56.417 --> 23:03.674
If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful,
the first runner up will take his place.

23:03.925 --> 23:06.219
And so on, and so forth.

23:06.469 --> 23:15.061
Some of you may die,
but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.104
Applause.

23:17.355 --> 23:23.110
Let the tournament begin.

23:25.696 --> 23:28.324
What is that?

23:28.574 --> 23:29.992
Ugh, it's hideous.

23:30.243 --> 23:33.120
Oh, that's not very nice.

23:33.371 --> 23:35.581
It's just a donkey.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.124
Indeed.

23:37.375 --> 23:42.463
Knights! New plan. The one, who kills the Ogre,
will be named champion.

23:42.713 --> 23:44.632
How about him.

23:44.882 --> 23:50.012
Oh, hey. Now, come on.

23:50.388 --> 23:54.767
Can't we just settle this over a pint?

23:55.017 --> 23:56.352
No?

23:56.602 --> 23:59.438
All right then.

23:59.689 --> 24:03.985
Come on.

24:32.430 --> 24:37.894
Hey Shrek! Let me, let me!

24:46.736 --> 24:52.033
The chair! Give him the chair!

25:14.055 --> 25:16.057
Thank you. Thank you, very much.

25:16.307 --> 25:20.478
I'm here until Thursday. Try the wheel!

25:25.274 --> 25:26.984
Shall I give the order sir?

25:27.235 --> 25:30.780
No. I have a better idea.

25:31.030 --> 25:35.910
People of Duloc. I give you our champion!

25:36.160 --> 25:38.079
What?

25:38.329 --> 25:40.206
Congratulation, Ogre.

25:40.456 --> 25:44.085
You've won the honor of embarking
on a great and noble quest.

25:44.335 --> 25:46.963
Quest? I'm already on a quest.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.840
A quest to get my swamp back!

25:49.090 --> 25:51.968
-Your swamp?
-Yeah, my swamp!

25:52.218 --> 25:55.638
Where you dumped those fairytale creatures.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.014
Indeed.

25:57.265 --> 25:59.267
All right Ogre, I'll make you a deal.

25:59.517 --> 26:03.771
Go on this quest for me and
I'll give you your swamp back.

26:04.021 --> 26:06.315
Exactly the way it was?

26:06.566 --> 26:08.818
Down to the last slime covered toast tool.

26:09.068 --> 26:13.364
-And the squatters?
-As good as gone.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.954
What kind of quest?

26:20.204 --> 26:20.746
Ok, let me get this straight!

26:20.997 --> 26:25.293
We gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess
just so Farquaad will give you back the swamp,

26:25.293 --> 26:27.628
which you only don't have, 'cause he filled it
with full of freaks on the first place.

26:27.879 --> 26:29.422
-Is that about right?
-You know what?

26:29.672 --> 26:32.592
Maybe there is a good reason, donkeys shouldn't talk.

26:32.842 --> 26:35.720
I don't get it Shrek.
Why didn't you just pull some old Ogre stuff on them?

26:35.970 --> 26:41.066
You know, ??? . Grab his bones to make you brave.
You know the whole Ogre trick.

26:41.184 --> 26:47.179
Oh, you know what. Maybe I could have decapitated
entire village and put their heads on plate.

26:47.315 --> 26:51.652
Got a knife, cut open their spleens
and drink their fluids.

26:51.652 --> 26:54.572
Does that sound good to you?

26:54.822 --> 26:56.282
A, no, not really, no.

26:56.532 --> 26:59.994
For your information,
there is a lot more to Ogres than people think.

27:00.244 --> 27:02.622
-Example.
-Example?

27:02.872 --> 27:07.168
OK, A-a-m, Ogres are like onions.

27:08.544 --> 27:09.921
-They stink?
-Yes, no.

27:10.171 --> 27:11.339
-O, they make you cry.
-No.

27:11.589 --> 27:14.917
Oh, you leave them out on the sun and
they get all brown and start ??? little wild hairs?

27:14.967 --> 27:19.263
No! Layers! Onions have layers.

27:19.639 --> 27:22.517
Ogres have layers. Onions have layers.

27:22.767 --> 27:27.063
You get it? We both have layers.

27:27.647 --> 27:31.651
O, you both have layers.

27:31.901 --> 27:33.986
You know not everybody likes onions.

27:34.237 --> 27:37.031
Cake! Everybody loves cakes. Cakes have layers.

27:37.281 --> 27:40.868
I don't care what everyone likes.

27:41.118 --> 27:45.414
Ogres are not like cakes.

27:47.542 --> 27:48.918
You know what else everyone likes? Paffe.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.796
Have you ever met a person and you say:
"Hey, let's get some paffe" and

27:52.046 --> 27:54.131
they say I don't like paffe. Paffe is delicious.

27:54.382 --> 27:58.678
No! You tensed, irritating, miniature peace of barden.

27:58.719 --> 28:01.514
Ogres are like onions. End of story.

28:01.764 --> 28:06.060
Bye, bye. See you lather.

28:08.855 --> 28:12.441
Paffe is maybe the most delicious thing
on the whole damn planet.

28:12.692 --> 28:15.194
You know I think I've preferred your humming.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.780
Do you have a tissue or something,
 'cause I'm making a mess.

28:18.030 --> 28:22.326
Just the word paffe has made me start slimying

29:00.823 --> 29:02.783
Why, Shrek, did you do that?

29:03.034 --> 29:05.369
Man you got to warn somebody
before you just crack one off.

29:05.620 --> 29:06.662
My mouth was opened and everything.

29:06.913 --> 29:11.209
Believe me donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead.

29:11.709 --> 29:14.754
It's brimstone. We must be getting close.

29:15.004 --> 29:17.381
Yeah, right, brimstone.

29:17.632 --> 29:20.635
Don't be talking ??? brimstone.
I know what I smell and ??? no brimstone.

29:20.885 --> 29:25.181
And they don't come of stone neither.

29:40.821 --> 29:45.159
Sure it's big enough, but look at the location.

29:48.829 --> 29:53.125
Oh, Shrek, remember when you said
that Ogres have layers?

29:53.125 --> 29:55.503
Oh, yeah.

29:55.753 --> 29:58.923
Well, I have a confession to make.
Donkeys don't have layers.

29:59.173 --> 30:01.259
We wear ??? sleeves.

30:01.509 --> 30:03.636
Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.

30:03.886 --> 30:08.182
-You know what I mean.
-Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of highs.

30:08.558 --> 30:12.854
No, I'm just a little uncomfortable of being
on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava!

30:12.854 --> 30:16.607
Come on donkey, I'm right here beside you. Ok?

30:16.858 --> 30:19.402
For emotional support.

30:19.652 --> 30:23.948
We'll just hackle this thing together
one little baby step after time.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.033
-Really?
-Really really.

30:26.284 --> 30:28.302
Ok. That makes me feel so much better.

30:28.452 --> 30:31.414
Just keep moving and don't look down.

30:31.664 --> 30:35.960
Don't look down, don't look down.

30:40.006 --> 30:42.675
Shrek! I'm looking down!

30:42.925 --> 30:44.427
I can't do this. Just let me off right now, please.

30:44.677 --> 30:47.889
-But you're already half way.
-Yeah, but I know that half is safe.

30:48.139 --> 30:50.850
Ok, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.

30:51.100 --> 30:55.396
Shrek, no, wait.

30:56.314 --> 30:57.607
Don't do that!

30:57.857 --> 31:00.860
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

31:01.110 --> 31:04.864
-Oh. This?
-Yes, that!

31:05.114 --> 31:08.451
Yes, yes. Do it. OK.

31:08.701 --> 31:12.997
-No, Shrek!
-I'm doing it.

31:13.122 --> 31:17.418
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die.

31:19.837 --> 31:24.133
That will do Donkey, that will do.

31:27.512 --> 31:29.639
Cool.

31:29.889 --> 31:32.341
So where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway?

31:32.391 --> 31:36.145
Inside. Waiting for us to rescue her.

31:36.395 --> 31:40.691
I was talking about the dragon Shrek.

31:55.957 --> 32:00.253
-Are you afraid?
-No, but shhhhh.

32:00.878 --> 32:05.174
Oh, good. Me neither.

32:05.424 --> 32:09.720
Because there's nothing wrong with being afraid.
Here's a..., something responsible of the situation.

32:10.471 --> 32:14.767
Not to mention dangerous situation.
And there's dragon that breathes fire.

32:15.518 --> 32:18.846
I'm sure he's meaner than a cow or anything,
but they're scare. You know what I mean.

32:18.896 --> 32:23.192
I'm sure he's heavier than a cow...

32:23.442 --> 32:26.737
Donkey. Two things. Ok?

32:26.988 --> 32:29.323
Shut, up.

32:29.574 --> 32:31.909
Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.

32:32.159 --> 32:34.345
Stairs? I thought we were looking for the princess.

32:34.495 --> 32:38.791
The princess will be up the stairs in the
highest room in the tallest tower.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.169
What makes you think she'll be there?

32:41.419 --> 32:43.754
I read it in a book once.

32:44.005 --> 32:47.800
Cool. You handle the dragon, I'll handle the stairs.

32:48.050 --> 32:50.553
Oh, I'll find those stairs. I'll ???. That's right.

32:50.803 --> 32:55.099
Those stairs won't know which way they go.

32:57.810 --> 32:59.729
The drafting stairs, ???

32:59.979 --> 33:02.815
Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master.
I'm master of the stairs.

33:03.065 --> 33:07.361
I wish I had a stair right here right here now,
I'd step all over it.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.074
Well, at least we know where the princess is.

33:12.325 --> 33:16.621
-But where is the...
-Dragon!

33:31.010 --> 33:35.306
Donkey, look out!

33:45.274 --> 33:47.570
Got you.

34:25.648 --> 34:28.860
Oh, what large teeth you have.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.487
I mean, white sparkling teeth.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.656
You probably hear this all the time from your food, but

34:33.906 --> 34:37.368
you must bleach yourself,
because that is one dashing smile you got there.

34:37.618 --> 34:40.329
And do I detect the hint of minty freshness?

34:40.580 --> 34:43.248
And you know what else?

34:43.498 --> 34:48.795
You're a girl dragon. Oh, sure.
I mean 'course you're a girl dragon,

34:49.839 --> 34:54.135
'cause you're just ricking the feminine beauty out.

34:54.260 --> 34:58.556
What's the matter with you?
Do you have something in your eye?

34:59.140 --> 35:02.143
Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know
I'm a asthmatic and

35:02.393 --> 35:05.354
I don't know if we would worked out.
You'd be blowing smoke and stuff.

35:05.605 --> 35:09.609
Shrek!

35:09.859 --> 35:14.155
No, Shrek! Shrek!

35:46.562 --> 35:47.730
-Wake up!
-What?

35:47.980 --> 35:50.274
Are you princess Fiona?

35:50.525 --> 35:52.276
I am.

35:52.527 --> 35:55.071
Awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.

35:55.321 --> 35:57.323
Oh, that's nice. Now let's go.

35:57.573 --> 35:59.534
But wait, sir knight.

35:59.784 --> 36:01.702
This be our first meeting.

36:01.953 --> 36:05.414
Should not be wonderful, romantic moment?

36:05.665 --> 36:08.793
Yeah. Sorry lady there's no time.

36:09.043 --> 36:12.288
Hey, what are you doing?
You know, you should sweep me out of my feet.

36:12.338 --> 36:16.092
Out through the window and down
the rope by to your valued steed.

36:16.342 --> 36:18.302
You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?

36:18.553 --> 36:22.849
Uh-um.

36:22.932 --> 36:25.518
But we have to sing through this moment.

36:25.768 --> 36:28.354
You can residing of a poem to me.

36:28.604 --> 36:32.900
A ballad, a sonnet, a libretti. Or something.

36:33.401 --> 36:34.652
I don't think so.

36:34.902 --> 36:39.198
Well, can I at least know a name of my champion?

36:40.408 --> 36:41.868
Shrek.

36:42.118 --> 36:44.662
So, Shrek.

36:44.912 --> 36:49.208
I pray that you take this favor
as a token of my gratitude.

36:51.002 --> 36:55.298
Thanks.

36:56.591 --> 37:00.887
-You didn't slay the dragon?
-It's not my job to do this. Now, come on!

37:01.220 --> 37:05.516
But this isn't right. ???

37:06.893 --> 37:07.852
That's what all the other knights did.

37:08.102 --> 37:10.980
Yeah. Right before they burst in the flame.

37:11.230 --> 37:13.983
That's not the point.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.569
Wait. Where are you going? Exit is over there.

37:16.819 --> 37:19.363
Well, I have to save my ass.

37:19.614 --> 37:22.491
What kind of knight are you?

37:22.742 --> 37:27.038
One of a kind.

37:35.046 --> 37:37.882
...rush into a physical relationship.

37:38.132 --> 37:42.386
I'm not that emotionally ready
for commitment of a this  magnitude.

37:42.553 --> 37:45.014
That was the word I was looking for. Magnitude.

37:45.264 --> 37:47.642
Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.

37:47.892 --> 37:49.560
Hey, what are you doing?

37:49.810 --> 37:53.064
Ok, ok, let's just back up a little and
take this one step at the time.

37:53.314 --> 37:55.558
I mean, we really should get to know each other first,
you know what am I saying.

37:55.608 --> 37:59.904
As friends, maybe even as ???

38:04.492 --> 38:06.410
Hey don't do that. That's my tail.
That's ma personal tail.

38:06.661 --> 38:10.957
And you're going to tear it off....

38:14.043 --> 38:18.339
Oh, no. No!

38:44.907 --> 38:49.203
-It talks?!
-Yeah. It's getting to shut up, that's a trick.

39:25.531 --> 39:29.327
Ok, you two. Head for the exit.

39:29.577 --> 39:33.831
I'll take care of the dragon.

39:37.793 --> 39:42.089
Ruuuuun!

40:28.469 --> 40:30.680
You did it. You rescued me.

40:30.930 --> 40:35.226
Amizing, you're wonderful. You're a ...

40:36.310 --> 40:39.230
...a little unorthodox I admit, but

40:39.480 --> 40:45.776
by deed is great and by heart is pure.
I'm entirely in your debt.

40:47.738 --> 40:52.076
And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed.

40:52.118 --> 40:54.912
I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed.

40:55.162 --> 40:57.623
She thinks I'm a steed.

40:57.874 --> 41:02.170
The battle is won.
You may remove your helmet good sir knight.

41:02.545 --> 41:05.923
-Aah, no.
-Why not?

41:06.174 --> 41:07.466
I have helmet hair.

41:07.717 --> 41:10.603
Please. I wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer.

41:10.753 --> 41:13.306
Oh, no, you wouldn't, dust.

41:13.556 --> 41:15.850
But, how will you kiss me?

41:16.100 --> 41:20.396
What? That wasn't in a job description.

41:20.521 --> 41:24.025
-Maybe it's a perk?
-No. It's destiny.

41:24.275 --> 41:26.819
You must know how it goes.

41:27.069 --> 41:33.365
A princess locked in a tower and besieged
by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight.

41:33.618 --> 41:37.413
And then they share true love's first kiss.

41:37.663 --> 41:40.041
With Shrek? You think, wait...

41:40.291 --> 41:42.502
...you think Shrek is your true love?

41:42.752 --> 41:47.048
Well, yes.

41:48.799 --> 41:50.885
You think that Shrek is your true love.

41:51.135 --> 41:53.095
What is so funny?

41:53.346 --> 41:55.848
Let's just say, I'm not your type, ok?

41:56.098 --> 41:59.644
Of course you are. You're my rescuer.

41:59.894 --> 42:01.854
Now, now remove your helmet.

42:02.104 --> 42:04.390
Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.

42:04.440 --> 42:06.317
-Just take off the helmet.
-I'm not going to.

42:06.567 --> 42:07.527
-Take it off!
-No!

42:07.777 --> 42:11.531
-Now!
-Ok, easy.

42:11.781 --> 42:16.077
As you command your highness.

42:26.212 --> 42:29.048
You're an Ogre.

42:29.298 --> 42:31.926
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

42:32.176 --> 42:36.472
Well, yes, actually.

42:37.223 --> 42:41.819
Oh no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an Ogre.

42:43.104 --> 42:47.400
Princess, I was sent to rescue you by lord Farquaad, ok?

42:47.733 --> 42:49.443
He's the one, who wants to marry you.

42:49.694 --> 42:51.946
Well, then why didn't he come to rescue me?

42:52.196 --> 42:55.491
Good question.
You should ask him that, when we get there.

42:55.741 --> 42:58.744
But I have to be rescued by my true love.

42:58.995 --> 43:01.831
Not by some Ogre and his pet.

43:02.081 --> 43:03.749
Well so much for noble steed.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.535
Look princess. You're not making my job any easier.

43:06.586 --> 43:09.881
Well I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.

43:10.131 --> 43:15.327
You can tell lord Farquaad
that if he wants to rescue me properly,

43:15.569 --> 43:17.763
I'll be waiting for him right here.

43:18.014 --> 43:21.475
Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy, all right?

43:21.726 --> 43:26.022
-I'm a delivery boy.
-You wouldn't dare.

43:26.689 --> 43:27.815
-You coming donkey?
-Put me down!

43:28.065 --> 43:29.692
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

43:29.942 --> 43:32.945
Put me down or you will suffer the consequences.

43:33.196 --> 43:37.533
This is not dignified. Put me down.

43:40.119 --> 43:42.988
Ok, here's another question. Let's say that a woman
'digged' you, but you don't really like her,

43:43.039 --> 43:46.325
that way. Now, how you let her down real easy,
so her feelings aren't hurt?

43:46.375 --> 43:49.186
But you don't get burned to a crisp neither.
How do you do this?

43:49.337 --> 43:51.422
Just tell her, she's not your true love.

43:51.672 --> 43:54.842
Everyone knows it what happens when you find...

43:55.092 --> 43:59.588
Hey! The sooner we get to Duloc, the better.

43:59.972 --> 44:02.308
Oh, yeah. You gonna love it there princess.
It's beautiful.

44:02.558 --> 44:06.178
And what of my groom to be, lord Farquaad.
What's he like?

44:06.229 --> 44:09.106
Well, let me put it this way, princess.

44:09.357 --> 44:13.694
Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply.

44:14.487 --> 44:18.824
Oh no, Shrek. There are those who think little of him.

44:21.285 --> 44:23.788
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.

44:24.038 --> 44:28.534
You know, you're just jealous that you can never
measure up to a great ruler like lord Farquaad.

44:29.210 --> 44:35.606
Yeah. Well maybe you're right princess. But I'd like
you do that measuring when you see him tomorrow

44:35.983 --> 44:38.219
Tomorrow?

44:38.469 --> 44:40.179
It will take that long?

44:40.429 --> 44:44.725
-Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
-No. That would take longer.

44:44.809 --> 44:45.893
We can keep going.

44:46.143 --> 44:49.021
But there are robbers in the woods.

44:49.272 --> 44:52.266
Whoa, time out Shrek.
Camp is definitely something that sounds good.

44:52.316 --> 44:56.237
Hey. Come on.
I'm scarier than anything we're gonna see in this forest.

44:56.487 --> 45:00.783
I need to find somewhere to camp, now!

45:05.830 --> 45:07.832
Hey, over here.

45:08.082 --> 45:12.378
Shrek, we can do better than that.
Now, I don't think this is decent for princess.

45:12.628 --> 45:15.756
No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.

45:16.007 --> 45:20.303
Homey touches? Like what?

45:21.220 --> 45:22.388
A door.

45:22.638 --> 45:24.932
Well, gentleman I'll be d..., good night.

45:25.183 --> 45:27.301
Do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime story,
'cause I will...

45:27.351 --> 45:31.647
I said good night!

45:33.282 --> 45:35.860
Shrek! What are you doing?

45:36.110 --> 45:37.486
I just..., you know...

45:37.737 --> 45:42.033
Oh, come on, I was just kidding.

45:46.537 --> 45:49.498
And that one, that's Throwback.

45:49.749 --> 45:53.211
The only Ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.

45:53.461 --> 45:57.381
Right. Yeah.

45:57.532 --> 45:59.133
Hey, can you tell my future form these stars?

45:59.383 --> 46:01.385
Well, the stars don't tell the future, Donkey.

46:01.636 --> 46:04.222
They tell stories. Look.

46:04.372 --> 46:06.349
There's Blodna, the "Flatulent"

46:06.599 --> 46:08.809
You can guess what he is famous for.

46:09.060 --> 46:10.520
All right. Now I know you're making this up.

46:10.770 --> 46:15.066
No. Look. There he is and there's the group of hunters
running away from his stag.

46:15.859 --> 46:19.028
Man, there ain't nothing, but a bunch of little dots.

46:19.278 --> 46:23.574
You know donkey,
sometimes things are more than they appear.

46:25.409 --> 46:29.705
Forget it.

46:30.915 --> 46:34.168
Hey Shrek.
What are you gonna do when we get our swamp back, anyway?

46:34.418 --> 46:38.214
-Our swamp?
-You know. When we're through rescuing the princess
 and all that stuff.

46:38.464 --> 46:42.343
We? Donkey, there is no we. There's no our.

46:42.593 --> 46:44.679
There's just me and my swamp.

46:44.929 --> 46:49.225
And the first thing I'm gonna do,
is build a ten foot wall around my land.

46:50.726 --> 46:55.022
You cut me deep Shrek, you cut me real deep just now.

46:55.398 --> 46:59.894
You know, what I think? I think this whole wall thing
is just a way to keep somebody out.

47:00.862 --> 47:04.073
No, do you think?

47:04.323 --> 47:07.493
-Are you hiding something?
-Never mind Donkey.

47:07.743 --> 47:10.788
Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?

47:11.038 --> 47:14.250
No. This is one of those drop it and leave it alone things.

47:14.500 --> 47:18.045
-Why don't you want to talk about it?
-Why do you want to talk about it?

47:18.296 --> 47:20.590
-Oh, Why you block?
-I'm not blocking.
-Oh yes you are.

47:20.840 --> 47:24.135
-Donkey, I'm warning you.
-Who are you trying to keep out?
 Just tell me that Shrek. Who?

47:24.385 --> 47:26.888
Everyone, ok?

47:27.138 --> 47:31.434
-Oh, now we're getting somewhere.
-Oh, for 'the love of pit'.

47:32.643 --> 47:35.354
Hey, what's your problem Shrek?
What do you got against the whole world anyway?

47:35.605 --> 47:37.648
Look. I'm not the one with the problem, ok?

47:37.899 --> 47:40.610
It's the world that seems to have a problem with me.

47:40.860 --> 47:44.822
People take one look at me and go: AAA... Help! Run!

47:44.972 --> 47:49.368
A big stupid ugly Ogre.

47:49.702 --> 47:52.755
They judge me, before they even know me.

47:53.006 --> 47:57.302
That's why I'm better off alone.

48:04.075 --> 48:08.471
You know what? When we met,
I didn't think you're just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.

48:10.957 --> 48:14.268
Yeah, I know.

48:14.319 --> 48:17.480
So, a... Are there any donkeys up there?

48:17.730 --> 48:22.026
Well, there's a Cabby. The small and annoying.

48:23.236 --> 48:27.532
Ok, ok. I see him, now. Big shining one, right there.
That one, over there?

48:28.407 --> 48:32.745
That's the moon.

48:53.808 --> 48:58.104
Again. Show me again.

48:59.647 --> 49:03.943
Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess.

49:09.866 --> 49:14.161
Perfect.

50:17.217 --> 50:21.812
Yeah. You know I like like that. Oh come on baby...

50:21.854 --> 50:26.150
-Donkey. Wake up.
-What? -Wake up.

50:27.401 --> 50:31.405
Morning. How do you like your eggs?

50:31.656 --> 50:35.209
-Good morning princess.
-What's all this about?

50:35.260 --> 50:40.456
You know, we kind of got of to a bad start yesterday
and I wanted to make it up to you.

50:41.290 --> 50:45.586
I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

50:47.088 --> 50:49.173
Thanks.

50:49.423 --> 50:53.719
Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.

50:58.891 --> 51:01.394
-Shrek!
-What? It's a compliment.

51:01.644 --> 51:04.213
Better out than in I always say.

51:04.364 --> 51:07.984
But that's no way to behave in front of a princess.

51:08.234 --> 51:11.863
-Thanks.
-She's as nasty as you are.

51:12.113 --> 51:15.533
You know. You're not exactly what I've expected.

51:15.783 --> 51:20.079
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people
before you get to know them.

51:26.394 --> 51:29.163
Princess!

51:29.714 --> 51:31.048
What are you doing?

51:31.299 --> 51:39.595
???mon shery, for I am your saviour.
And I am rescuing you from this green...beast.

51:40.641 --> 51:43.853
Hey! That's my princess. Go find your own.

51:44.103 --> 51:48.399
Please, monster. Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

51:49.442 --> 51:52.862
Look, pal. I don't know who you think you are.

51:53.112 --> 51:54.822
Oh, of course. How rude that was.

51:55.072 --> 51:59.368
Please, let me introduce myself. Oh marry men!

52:46.958 --> 52:48.459
Man, that was annoying.

52:48.709 --> 52:53.005
Oh, you little...

53:19.365 --> 53:22.034
Shall we?

53:22.285 --> 53:26.080
???all the forin???

53:26.330 --> 53:29.333
Whoa, hold on, now. Where did that come from?

53:29.584 --> 53:33.171
-What?
-That. Back there. That was amazing.

53:33.421 --> 53:34.755
Where did you learn that?

53:35.006 --> 53:40.502
Well, when one lives alone one has to learn
these things in case there's a...

53:41.012 --> 53:42.346
There is an arrow in your butt.

53:42.597 --> 53:45.183
What? Oh, would you look at that.

53:45.433 --> 53:48.311
Oh, no... This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

53:48.561 --> 53:52.190
-What's wrong?
-Shrek's hurt.
-Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt!

53:52.440 --> 53:54.734
-Oh, no. Shrek's going to die.
-Donkey, I'm ok.

53:54.984 --> 53:57.403
You can't do this to me Shrek.
I'm too young for you to die.

53:57.653 --> 53:58.988
Keep your legs elevated. Turn your head ???.

53:59.238 --> 54:02.241
-Does anyone know how to handle...
-Donkey! Calm down.

54:02.491 --> 54:06.787
If you want to help Shrek, run into woods and
find me a blue flower with red thorns.

54:07.038 --> 54:11.334
Blue flower, red thorns. Ok, I'm on it.
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

54:11.501 --> 54:13.878
Don't die Shrek.
And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

54:14.128 --> 54:18.090
-Donkey!
-Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.
 Blue flower, red thorns.

54:18.341 --> 54:22.178
-What are the flowers for?
-For getting rid of the Donkey.

54:22.428 --> 54:24.722
Now, you hold still and I'll yank this thing out.

54:24.972 --> 54:28.809
-Hey! Easy with the yanking.
-I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

54:29.060 --> 54:32.438
No, no. It's tender.
What you're doing here is the opposite...

54:32.688 --> 54:38.984
-Don't move.
-Ok, look. Time out.
-Would you... Ok.

54:39.153 --> 54:41.197
What do you propose we do?

54:41.447 --> 54:43.533
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

54:43.783 --> 54:45.952
This would be so much easier if I wasn't colorblind.

54:46.202 --> 54:48.120
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

54:48.371 --> 54:51.667
Hold on, Shrek. I'm coming!

54:53.751 --> 54:55.086
Not good.

54:55.336 --> 54:59.632
Ok, ok, I can lose it. It's just about it.

55:04.470 --> 55:05.263
Nothing happened.

55:05.513 --> 55:07.181
We were just a...

55:07.431 --> 55:10.142
Look if you want to be alone,
all you had to do is ask, ok?

55:10.393 --> 55:13.771
Oh, come on. That's the last thing on my mind.

55:14.021 --> 55:18.317
The princess here was just... Au!

55:23.072 --> 55:27.368
Hey, what's that? Is that...

56:57.416 --> 56:59.585
There it is, princess.

56:59.836 --> 57:02.547
-Your future awaits you.
-That's Duloc?

57:02.797 --> 57:08.293
Yeah. I know. You'll shrink things lord Farquaad is
compensating for something, which I think needs, he has a

57:11.055 --> 57:12.765
I guess we better move on.

57:13.015 --> 57:17.311
Sure, but Shrek...

57:17.436 --> 57:18.980
-I'm worried about Donkey.
-What?

57:19.230 --> 57:22.692
I mean. Look at him. He doesn't look so good.

57:22.942 --> 57:25.444
-What are you talking about? I'm fine.
-Well, that's what they always say.

57:25.695 --> 57:29.574
And the next thing you know you're on your back.

57:29.824 --> 57:32.952
-Dead!
-You know she's right. You look awful.

57:33.202 --> 57:36.414
-Do you want to sit down?
-You know, I'll make you up some tea.

57:36.664 --> 57:37.874
Well, I won't say nothing, but

57:38.124 --> 57:41.419
I've got this twinge in my neck.
And if I turn my neck like this, look. Au, see?

57:41.669 --> 57:44.630
-He's hungry. I'll find us some dinner.
-I'll get the firewood.

57:44.881 --> 57:51.177
Hey, where are you going? Oh man, I can't feel my thumbs.
I don't have any thumbs!!!

57:52.263 --> 57:55.059
I think I need a hug.

58:01.772 --> 58:06.068
This is good. This is really good.

58:06.736 --> 58:09.655
-What is this?
-Wheat rat.

58:09.906 --> 58:14.202
-Rotisserie style.
-No kidding.

58:14.327 --> 58:17.788
-Oh, this is delicious.
-Well, they also great in stews.

58:18.039 --> 58:22.335
Now, I don't mean to brag,
but I make a mean wheat rat stew.

58:26.589 --> 58:30.885
I guess I'll be dining a little different
late tomorrow night.

58:31.636 --> 58:35.097
Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime.

58:35.348 --> 58:37.558
I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.

58:37.808 --> 58:42.104
Swamp toast, soup fish, eye tartar. You name it.

58:43.406 --> 58:45.902
I'd like that.

58:54.011 --> 59:01.207
-Ah... , princess?
-Yes, Shrek?

59:02.542 --> 59:06.170
I'm a.... I was wondering.

59:06.420 --> 59:10.716
Are you... a...

59:11.509 --> 59:15.805
Are you gonna eat that?

59:20.351 --> 59:23.437
Man, isn't this romantic. Just look at that sunset.

59:23.688 --> 59:27.984
Sunset?! Oh, no. It's late. It's very late.

59:28.651 --> 59:32.321
-What?
-Wait a minute. I see what's going on here.

59:32.572 --> 59:34.282
You're afraid of the dark. Aren't you?

59:34.532 --> 59:38.828
Yes, yes. That's it. That's, I'm terrified.
You know I'll better go inside.

59:39.078 --> 59:41.581
But don't feel bad, princess.
I used to be afraid of the dark too.

59:41.831 --> 59:46.127
Until... Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

59:47.128 --> 59:51.424
-Good night.
-Good night.

59:54.303 --> 59:57.597
Ahh. Now I really see what's going on here.

59:57.847 --> 59:59.599
Oh, what are you talking about.

59:59.749 --> 01:00:01.976
Hey I don't wanna even hear.
Look, I'm an animal and I got instincts.

01:00:02.226 --> 01:00:04.437
And I know that you two are digging on each other.
I can feel it.

01:00:04.687 --> 01:00:08.983
Oh, you're crazy.
I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

01:00:08.983 --> 01:00:11.402
Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the fairemones.

01:00:11.652 --> 01:00:14.197
Just go in there and tell her how you feel.

01:00:14.447 --> 01:00:18.784
There's nothing to tell.
Besides, even if I did tell her that... well you know.

01:00:20.203 --> 01:00:23.915
I'm not saying that I do, 'cause I don't.

01:00:24.165 --> 01:00:26.751
She's a princess and I'm...

01:00:27.001 --> 01:00:29.212
...an Ogre.

01:00:29.462 --> 01:00:32.173
Yeah, an Ogre.

01:00:32.423 --> 01:00:36.719
-Hey, where are you going?
-To get more firewood.

01:00:55.404 --> 01:00:59.700
Princess. Princess Fiona?

01:01:04.455 --> 01:01:08.751
Princess, where are you?

01:01:12.088 --> 01:01:16.384
Princess?

01:01:18.094 --> 01:01:22.390
It's very spooky in here and are we playing little games.

01:01:31.732 --> 01:01:34.443
-No, no.
-Help! Shrek! Shrek!

01:01:34.694 --> 01:01:36.362
-No. -Shrek!
-It's ok. It's ok.

01:01:36.612 --> 01:01:39.657
-What did you do with the princess?
-Donkey, shhh. I'm the princess.

01:01:39.907 --> 01:01:44.203
-It's me, in this body.
-Oh my god. You ate the princess.

01:01:44.662 --> 01:01:46.080
-Can you hear me?
-Donkey!

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:49.500
Listen, keep breathing. I'll get you out of there!

01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:52.461
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

01:01:52.712 --> 01:01:57.008
This is me.

01:01:59.343 --> 01:02:03.181
Princess? What happened to you?

01:02:03.431 --> 01:02:07.059
You're a... different.

01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:09.320
-I'm ugly, ok?
-Yeah.

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:12.607
Was it something that you ate?
'Cause I told Shrek those rats were a bad idea.

01:02:12.857 --> 01:02:18.153
-You are what you eat, I say.
-No. I've been this way as long as I can remember.

01:02:18.988 --> 01:02:21.407
What do you mean?
Look, I've never seen you like this before.

01:02:21.657 --> 01:02:25.953
It only happens when the sun goes down.

01:02:26.087 --> 01:02:34.083
By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm
until you find true love's first kiss.

01:02:35.379 --> 01:02:39.675
Then, take love's true form...

01:02:40.635 --> 01:02:44.931
-Oh, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.
-It's the spell.

01:02:46.432 --> 01:02:50.728
When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.

01:02:50.978 --> 01:02:55.274
Every night I become this. This horrible ugly beast.

01:03:00.029 --> 01:03:04.325
I was placed in a tower to await the day
when my true love would rescue me.

01:03:04.825 --> 01:03:12.121
That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow,
before the sun sets and he sees me, like this?

01:03:15.002 --> 01:03:19.298
All right, all right. Calm down.
Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly.

01:03:19.423 --> 01:03:23.719
Wait, wait, I'll not lie, you are ugly. But you only look like this at night.

01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:25.888
Shrek's ugly 24/7.

01:03:26.138 --> 01:03:31.434
But Donkey, I'm a princess.
And this is not how a princess is meant to look.

01:03:33.813 --> 01:03:36.816
Princess. How about if you don't marry Farquaad?

01:03:37.066 --> 01:03:41.362
I have to. Only my true love's kiss can brake the spell.

01:03:41.988 --> 01:03:45.449
But you know, you're kind of an Ogre.

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:48.911
And Shrek... Well you've got a lot in common.

01:03:49.161 --> 01:03:50.621
Shrek?

01:03:50.872 --> 01:03:57.168
Princess, I... How is it going first of all?
Good? Good for me to. I'm ok.

01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:02.842
I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty.

01:04:03.092 --> 01:04:08.388
And, well, I don't really like it, but I thought
you may like it, because you're pretty.

01:04:09.098 --> 01:04:13.394
But I like you anyway. A....

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:18.316
I'm in trouble. Ok, here we go.

01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:28.826
Who could ever love a piece so hideous and ugly?
Princess and ugly don't go together.

01:04:29.452 --> 01:04:35.748
That's why I can't stay here with Shrek, but only chance
to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.

01:04:38.503 --> 01:04:42.798
Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be.

01:04:44.342 --> 01:04:46.844
It's the only way to break the spell.

01:04:46.904 --> 01:04:48.846
Well, at least you've got tell Shrek the truth.

01:04:49.096 --> 01:04:51.891
No, no. You can't breathe the word.
No one must ever know.

01:04:52.141 --> 01:04:54.602
What's the point of being unable to talk?
You got to keep secrets.

01:04:54.852 --> 01:04:57.104
Promise you won't tell. Promise!

01:04:57.355 --> 01:05:01.651
All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should.

01:05:01.026 --> 01:05:03.861
You know, before this is over,
I'm going to need whole lot of serious therapies.

01:05:04.111 --> 01:05:08.407
Look at my eye twitching.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:34.976
I tell him, I tell him not.

01:05:35.184 --> 01:05:38.980
I tell him. I tell him not.

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:40.815
I tell him!

01:05:41.065 --> 01:05:45.361
Shrek! Shrek! There's something I want ...

01:06:07.049 --> 01:06:10.887
Shrek. Are you all right?

01:06:11.137 --> 01:06:13.806
Perfect. Never been better.

01:06:14.056 --> 01:06:17.310
I... There's something I have to tell you.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:21.355
You don't have to tell me anything, princess.
I heard enough last night.

01:06:21.606 --> 01:06:24.442
-You've heard what I said?
-Every word.

01:06:24.692 --> 01:06:25.735
I thought you'd understand?

01:06:25.985 --> 01:06:31.281
Oh, I understand!
Like you said, who could love a hideous, ugly beast!

01:06:33.201 --> 01:06:37.496
-I thought that wouldn't matter to you.
-Yeah, well, it does.

01:06:39.123 --> 01:06:44.219
Ah, right on time. Princess.
I brought you a little something.

01:06:50.259 --> 01:06:54.555
What I missed?  What I missed?

01:06:56.933 --> 01:07:01.229
-Princess Fiona.
-As promised. Now hand it over.

01:07:01.854 --> 01:07:07.150
Very well, Ogre. The deed to your swamp.
Cleared out as agreed. Take it and go.

01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:11.113
Before I change my mind.

01:07:11.364 --> 01:07:15.701
Forgive me princess for startling you,
but you startled me.

01:07:15.701 --> 01:07:19.455
For I've never seen such a radiant beauty before.

01:07:19.705 --> 01:07:24.001
-I am lord Farquaad.
-Lord Farquaad?

01:07:25.586 --> 01:07:34.582
Oh, no, no... forgive me my lord for
I was just saying short... farewell.

01:07:35.054 --> 01:07:39.350
Oh. That is so sweet.
You don't have to raise good manners on the Ogre.

01:07:40.351 --> 01:07:44.647
-It's not like it has feelings.
-No. You're right. It doesn't.

01:07:46.566 --> 01:07:50.319
Princess Fiona, beautiful fair flawless Fiona,

01:07:50.570 --> 01:07:56.866
I ask your hand in marriage.
Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:06.460
Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make...

01:08:06.711 --> 01:08:10.173
Excellent! I'll start the plans for tomorrow we wedd...

01:08:10.423 --> 01:08:14.302
No! I mean I... Why wait?

01:08:14.552 --> 01:08:18.471
Let's get married today. Before sunset.

01:08:18.723 --> 01:08:22.268
Oh, anxious are we? You're right. The sooner, the better.

01:08:22.518 --> 01:08:25.037
There's so much to do.

01:08:25.087 --> 01:08:29.984
There is the camera, the cake, the band, the guests...
Captain! Round up some guests.

01:08:31.109 --> 01:08:33.446
Farewell Ogre.

01:08:33.696 --> 01:08:35.781
Shrek, what are you doing?
You let her get away.

01:08:36.032 --> 01:08:39.911
-Yeah, so what.
-Shrek. There's something about her that you don't know.

01:08:40.161 --> 01:08:43.872
-I talked to her last night. She's...
-Yeah I know you talked to her last night.

01:08:44.122 --> 01:08:48.419
You're great pal, aren't you? Now, if you two are such
good friend, why didn't you follow her home?

01:08:49.295 --> 01:08:52.423
-Shrek. I want to go with you.
-I told you, didn't I?

01:08:52.673 --> 01:08:57.969
You're not coming home with me.
I live alone. My swamp, me and nobody else!

01:08:58.363 --> 01:09:05.059
Understand? Nobody!
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!

01:09:06.062 --> 01:09:10.358
-But. I thought...
-Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong.

01:09:12.902 --> 01:09:17.198
Shrek.

01:11:35.795 --> 01:11:38.089
Donkey?

01:11:38.339 --> 01:11:39.215
What are you doing?

01:11:39.465 --> 01:11:42.552
I was thinking of all the people,
you would recognize a wall when you see one.

01:11:42.802 --> 01:11:47.698
Well, yeah. But the wall supposed to go around my swamp.
Not through it.

01:11:47.807 --> 01:11:50.476
It is around your half.
See? That's your half and this is my half.

01:11:50.726 --> 01:11:53.354
Oh, your half?

01:11:53.604 --> 01:11:56.482
Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess.

01:11:56.732 --> 01:12:01.028
I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me
that big old rock, the one that looks like your head

01:12:02.071 --> 01:12:04.365
-Back off!
-No. You back off!

01:12:04.615 --> 01:12:06.284
-This is my swamp.
-Our swamp.

01:12:06.534 --> 01:12:08.119
-Let go, Donkey!
-You let go!

01:12:08.369 --> 01:12:10.204
-Stubborn jackass.
-Smelly Ogre.

01:12:10.454 --> 01:12:12.373
Fine!

01:12:12.623 --> 01:12:14.792
Hey, hey, come back here.
I'm not through with you, yet.

01:12:15.042 --> 01:12:19.338
-Well, I'm through with you!
-Well, you know. You were always me, me, me.

01:12:19.672 --> 01:12:21.841
Well, guess what? Now it's my turn!

01:12:22.091 --> 01:12:25.761
So you just shut up and pay attention!

01:12:25.912 --> 01:12:29.015
You are mean to me, you insult me,
you don't appreciate anything that I do!

01:12:29.265 --> 01:12:31.475
You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

01:12:31.726 --> 01:12:36.022
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?

01:12:36.147 --> 01:12:39.567
Because that's what friend do.
They forgive each other!

01:12:39.817 --> 01:12:45.571
Oh, yeah. You're right Donkey.
I forgive you for stabbing me in the back!

01:12:49.243 --> 01:12:52.580
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy.
You're afraid of your own feelings.

01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:56.042
-Go away.
-See? There you are, doing it again.
 Just like you did it to Fiona.

01:12:56.292 --> 01:12:58.544
And all she ever do, was like you.
Maybe even love you.

01:12:58.794 --> 01:13:03.090
Love me? She said I was ugly! A hideous creature.

01:13:03.216 --> 01:13:07.512
-I heard that you two were talking.
-She wasn't talking about you. She was talking about...

01:13:08.262 --> 01:13:11.724
...somebody else.

01:13:11.974 --> 01:13:16.270
She wasn't talking about me?
Well then, who was she talking about?

01:13:16.979 --> 01:13:20.441
No way, I'm not saying anything.
You won't listen to me, right? Right?

01:13:20.691 --> 01:13:22.985
-Donkey.
-No!

01:13:23.236 --> 01:13:27.532
Ok, look. I'm sorry, all right?

01:13:33.538 --> 01:13:35.164
I'm sorry.

01:13:35.414 --> 01:13:39.710
I guess I am just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.

01:13:40.586 --> 01:13:44.882
Can you forgive me?

01:13:44.974 --> 01:13:48.135
-Hey, that's the friends are for, right?
-Right.

01:13:48.386 --> 01:13:51.848
-Friends?
-Friends.

01:13:52.098 --> 01:13:56.394
So? What did Fiona said about me?

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:00.231
Why are you asking me for?
Why don't you just go ask her.

01:14:00.481 --> 01:14:03.985
The wedding! We'll never make it in time!

01:14:04.235 --> 01:14:06.237
Never fear! For where there is a will,
there is a way.

01:14:06.487 --> 01:14:10.783
And I have I way.

01:14:13.536 --> 01:14:15.746
Donkey?

01:14:15.997 --> 01:14:21.293
-I guess this is just my act of magnetism.
-Oh, come here, you.

01:14:21.502 --> 01:14:24.463
All right. All right.
Don't get all started. No one likes kissass.

01:14:24.714 --> 01:14:26.507
All right, hop on. Hold on tight.

01:14:26.757 --> 01:14:31.053
I hadn't have a chance to install seat belts, yet.

01:15:01.792 --> 01:15:12.088
People of Duloc. We gather here today
to bear witness to reunion of our new king...

01:15:12.261 --> 01:15:16.557
Excuse me. Could you just skip ahead to "I do's"?

01:15:17.225 --> 01:15:20.521
Go on.

01:15:22.774 --> 01:15:29.070
Go ahead and have some fun,
if we need you, I'll whistle. How about that?

01:15:30.404 --> 01:15:32.782
Shrek, wait, wait a minute.
You want to do this right, don't you?

01:15:33.032 --> 01:15:36.160
-What are you talking about?
-It's the line, it's the line you got to wait for.

01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:38.704
The priest is going to say:
"Speak now or forever hold your peace".

01:15:38.955 --> 01:15:41.249
And that's where you say: "I object".

01:15:41.499 --> 01:15:44.627
-I don't have time for this.
-Wait, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me!

01:15:44.877 --> 01:15:46.087
Look, you love this woman, don't you?

01:15:46.337 --> 01:15:47.296
-Yes.
-You want to hold her!

01:15:47.547 --> 01:15:49.674
-Yes.
-Please her!
-Yes!

01:15:49.924 --> 01:15:53.052
Then you got to, got to try a little tender love.

01:15:53.202 --> 01:15:57.598
-The chicks love that romantic crap.
-All right. Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?

01:15:58.516 --> 01:16:00.151
We got to check it out.

01:16:00.201 --> 01:16:03.271
And as so by the power of these two...

01:16:03.521 --> 01:16:05.231
What do you see?

01:16:05.481 --> 01:16:09.777
-I now pronounce you...
-There they go!

01:16:11.729 --> 01:16:15.783
-...he all ready said it.
-Oh, for 'the love of pit'.

01:16:16.033 --> 01:16:18.619
I object!

01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:20.413
Shrek?

01:16:20.663 --> 01:16:24.959
Oh, now what does he want?

01:16:26.002 --> 01:16:29.964
Hi, everyone. Having a good time, aren't you?

01:16:30.214 --> 01:16:31.883
I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.

01:16:32.133 --> 01:16:36.429
-What are you doing here?
-Really, it's rude enough being alive, when no one wants you.

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:38.848
But showing up uninvited to a wedding...

01:16:39.098 --> 01:16:43.394
-Fiona! I need to talk to you.
-Oh, now you wanna talk?

01:16:43.394 --> 01:16:46.147
Well it's a little late for that.
So if you'll excuse me.

01:16:46.397 --> 01:16:48.900
-But you can't marry him!
-And why not?

01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:53.446
Because, because he's just marrying you
so he can be king.

01:16:53.446 --> 01:16:56.866
-Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
-He's not your true love.

01:16:57.116 --> 01:17:02.712
-What do you know about true love?
-Well, I ...I'm in...

01:17:02.788 --> 01:17:06.083
Oh, this is precious.

01:17:06.334 --> 01:17:10.630
The Ogre has fallen in love with the princess.

01:17:11.172 --> 01:17:15.468
Laugh.

01:17:19.722 --> 01:17:23.559
Shrek. Is this true?

01:17:23.809 --> 01:17:31.105
Who cares. It's preposterious. Fiona, my love, we gonna kiss
away for our happily ever after. Now kiss me!

01:17:37.198 --> 01:17:41.494
By night one way, by day another.

01:17:42.503 --> 01:17:46.999
I wanted to show you before.

01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:12.525
Well. That explains a lot.

01:18:13.409 --> 01:18:18.905
Oh. It's disgusting. Guards, guards.
I order you to get them out of my sight.

01:18:19.699 --> 01:18:23.995
-Now! Get them! Get them, both!
-No!

01:18:25.121 --> 01:18:29.417
This marriage is minding,  and that makes me king. See? See?

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:30.835
-Shrek!
-No.

01:18:31.085 --> 01:18:35.381
-Don't just stand there, you dogs.
-Get out of my way.

01:18:43.472 --> 01:18:46.184
No! Shrek!

01:18:46.434 --> 01:18:48.728
-And as for you my wife.
-Fiona!

01:18:48.978 --> 01:18:53.274
I'll have you locked back in that tower
for the rest of your days!

01:18:54.192 --> 01:18:58.487
I will have order. I will have potential.
I will have...

01:19:03.951 --> 01:19:08.247
All right, nobody move!
I got a dragon here and I'm not afraid to use it.

01:19:08.623 --> 01:19:12.919
I'm a donkey on the edge!

01:19:14.295 --> 01:19:18.591
Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?

01:19:20.009 --> 01:19:23.346
Go ahead Shrek.

01:19:23.596 --> 01:19:27.892
-Fiona?
-Yes, Shrek?

01:19:28.226 --> 01:19:32.522
I love you.

01:19:32.813 --> 01:19:35.358
Really?

01:19:35.608 --> 01:19:39.028
Really, really.

01:19:39.278 --> 01:19:43.574
I love you too.

01:19:50.373 --> 01:19:54.669
A time for true love's first kiss...

01:20:29.328 --> 01:20:33.624
Fiona?

01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:38.504
Fiona? Are you all right?

01:20:40.381 --> 01:20:44.343
Yes. But I don't understand.

01:20:44.594 --> 01:20:48.890
I'm supposed to be beautiful.

01:20:49.599 --> 01:20:53.895
But you are beautiful.

01:20:53.936 --> 01:20:58.232
I was hoping this would be a happy ending.

01:21:44.054 --> 01:21:47.950
God bless us, everyone.

01:22:51.888 --> 01:22:56.184
The End.
