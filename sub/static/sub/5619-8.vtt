00:01.920 --> 00:04.255
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.339 --> 00:06.424
You made some mistakes
at your gameplay.

00:06.508 --> 00:08.259
You don't even know
the game I'm playing.

00:08.510 --> 00:10.428
- Remember this?
- Yeah, from the castle chamber.

00:10.512 --> 00:13.848
Okay, what if the group who carved
this symbol into the chamber door

00:13.932 --> 00:15.433
is the same group that sent
Will through the portal?

00:15.517 --> 00:18.228
<i>I've only killed
those who deserve it.</i>

00:18.311 --> 00:21.398
<i>Who the hell made you
judge, jury, and executioner?</i>

00:21.481 --> 00:23.775
<i>If we put Andrew
in stasis as a human,</i>

00:23.858 --> 00:27.278
<i>it'll slow his transformation,
giving us more time to find a cure.</i>

00:27.362 --> 00:29.906
I wanted to apologise for missing
our meeting at NORAD.

00:29.989 --> 00:31.408
<i>I will bring him to you soon enough.</i>

00:31.491 --> 00:32.741
Time is of the essence.

00:32.826 --> 00:34.577
I'll be in touch.

00:34.661 --> 00:35.787
How about some breakfast?

00:48.299 --> 00:52.554
The octopus is one of
the great symbols of HYDRA.

00:53.179 --> 00:56.182
Supremely intelligent, highly adaptable,

00:56.307 --> 00:59.269
and they are ruthless killers.

00:59.352 --> 01:02.856
A nearly perfect predator.
The same could be said of you.

01:03.565 --> 01:08.361
Well, it's a terrifying symbol,
but not my idea of dinner.

01:09.237 --> 01:11.698
Then again, I am adaptable.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.910
I hope you can be, too.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.163
Well, that depends on your request.

01:19.831 --> 01:21.750
You're one of the last heads
of HYDRA's old guard.

01:21.833 --> 01:23.835
Thanks in no small part to you.

01:24.169 --> 01:27.547
You should be thanking me.
I trimmed the fat from your ranks.

01:27.672 --> 01:31.009
You weren't just trimming the fat,
going after the Von Strucker boy.

01:31.092 --> 01:32.260
You were digging,

01:32.343 --> 01:34.554
and I know what
you were hoping to find.

01:35.180 --> 01:38.224
You're chasing rumours. Ghosts.

01:38.558 --> 01:42.187
The Von Strucker family vault
does not exist.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.647
Truthfully, I'd believe you,

01:44.731 --> 01:47.400
if you hadn't sacrificed
the only heir to it.

01:48.026 --> 01:50.612
You control the vault now. Right?

01:50.695 --> 01:53.740
The vault is said to have
HYDRA's greatest power.

01:55.033 --> 01:57.911
Why don't you and I put it to good use?

02:02.749 --> 02:05.919
HYDRA is a complicated organisation,

02:06.044 --> 02:09.547
and I don't have time
to give you a history lesson.

02:10.465 --> 02:14.052
I do have some longstanding plans

02:14.135 --> 02:17.597
that are finally coming together,
and your simple vendetta

02:17.972 --> 02:20.475
doesn't currently fit in with them.

02:24.229 --> 02:27.023
I will find that vault.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.775
You're a smart predator.

02:32.153 --> 02:34.906
But you don't live
on top of the food chain.

02:36.241 --> 02:38.076
Okay.

03:17.532 --> 03:19.450
Well fought.

03:21.119 --> 03:24.247
So,
Malick wanted me slaughtered.

03:24.330 --> 03:25.748
Which means I'm on the right track.

03:25.832 --> 03:27.959
See, I know where the vault is.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.127
Just don't know how to get in.

03:29.502 --> 03:31.546
Which creates
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

03:31.629 --> 03:34.299
for anyone who has
accompanied him there.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.633
We're not helping you.

03:36.718 --> 03:38.469
Well, then...

03:42.140 --> 03:45.643
Who's on the bottom
of the food chain now?

03:57.822 --> 04:00.867
That's the compound
we used to tranquilise Andrew.

04:00.992 --> 04:04.412
Those tanks should be enough
to keep him sedated if need be.

04:05.038 --> 04:06.372
Tell me we're doing the right thing.

04:06.497 --> 04:09.918
We are. He'll be put in stasis,
held in human form.

04:10.001 --> 04:12.170
Before that thing
can completely take him over.

04:12.837 --> 04:13.963
And the cure you're working on?

04:14.047 --> 04:16.048
We're throwing everything we can at it.

04:16.841 --> 04:19.385
He was one of the good ones. Is.

04:20.011 --> 04:22.764
I know he was a friend.
You're doing all you can.

04:22.847 --> 04:24.515
And we'll keep you up to speed
on everything we do.

04:26.017 --> 04:29.062
Maybe you should come
to the base in the next day or so,

04:29.187 --> 04:30.271
talk me through it.

04:30.355 --> 04:31.856
Anyone gonna talk to her?

04:42.450 --> 04:44.369
She'll talk when she's ready.

04:48.539 --> 04:51.084
Hey! Stop. Stop. Stop.

04:51.584 --> 04:55.004
Okay. Just go before you drop
another priceless manuscript.

04:55.088 --> 04:56.798
Why don't you go
deface a Picasso or something?

04:56.881 --> 04:58.591
- Fitz. What are you doing?
- They're all idiots.

04:58.716 --> 04:59.717
Be nice.

04:59.801 --> 05:02.053
Sorry. Well-meaning idiots.

05:02.804 --> 05:03.930
It's been a rough day.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.307
You brought in all these books.

05:06.432 --> 05:10.186
Every volume on symbolic
anthropology and iconography

05:10.269 --> 05:11.562
I could find.

05:12.063 --> 05:14.232
Hopefully it matches, um...

05:19.946 --> 05:21.572
This.

05:22.615 --> 05:24.117
It's the Ram's Head symbol.

05:24.242 --> 05:27.412
I think Will's Distant Star Pathfinder
programme hid it in their logo.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.831
About 200 years after
the group studying the Monolith

05:29.914 --> 05:31.749
chiselled it into the floor of the castle?

05:32.458 --> 05:34.460
Yeah. No coincidence there.

05:34.585 --> 05:35.670
If we get lucky,

05:35.753 --> 05:39.298
tracing its origin could give us
some sort of insight into how to save...

05:43.261 --> 05:48.099
Sorry. I just feel so bad for May.
I don't know how you get over that.

05:52.353 --> 05:55.023
She's been giving me
the hate stare since I got here.

05:55.106 --> 05:56.691
I had to sleep
with one eye open last night.

05:56.774 --> 05:57.817
But you slept?

05:57.942 --> 06:00.361
Yeah. For the first time in a long time.

06:00.445 --> 06:02.530
I've been running
long enough to appreciate

06:02.613 --> 06:05.158
a secret underground base
no one knows about.

06:05.283 --> 06:08.286
Even if you all live
on top of each other like Keebler Elves.

06:08.369 --> 06:11.289
It's one roof,
but it's big, lots of space.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.332
Not that you need to keep your space.

06:14.292 --> 06:18.546
I know. I'm sorry I moved in.
I hope it's not weird.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.465
- Weird?
- We kissed.

06:20.548 --> 06:23.134
That happened.
Do we need to talk about it?

06:23.217 --> 06:25.303
Nope. We do not need to.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.805
Why don't we just see what happens?

06:28.306 --> 06:29.891
Will that happen again?

06:29.974 --> 06:31.684
Planning takes the fun out of it.

06:31.809 --> 06:33.895
Plus, you know you'll have
tougher decisions to face, right?

06:33.978 --> 06:35.605
You can't just stay here.

06:35.688 --> 06:38.483
Coulson only lets people in the base
who have a role in his game plan.

06:50.369 --> 06:53.081
I feel like you're gonna tell me
I didn't make Little League all-stars.

06:53.164 --> 06:54.624
It's Rosalind, sir.

06:54.707 --> 06:56.084
I know you two have grown closer

06:56.167 --> 06:58.503
and I'm concerned
that maybe you might...

06:59.087 --> 07:01.047
Um... Maybe you two...

07:01.172 --> 07:02.215
You can say it.

07:02.340 --> 07:03.466
Are you sleeping together?

07:03.549 --> 07:04.634
That's none of your business.

07:04.717 --> 07:07.095
I'm sorry to press, sir,
but I need to know.

07:07.178 --> 07:10.014
Do you have feelings for her?
Or are you playing an angle?

07:10.098 --> 07:12.350
Again, not your business.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.018
But you really think I'm that guy?

07:14.102 --> 07:15.853
If not, then it is my business.

07:15.937 --> 07:18.147
Because now you're bringing her,
the head of the ATCU,

07:18.231 --> 07:19.482
into our hidden base.

07:19.565 --> 07:22.360
Easy, Mack. I like Roz.

07:23.361 --> 07:25.863
Whether she can be trusted,
yet to be determined.

07:25.947 --> 07:27.323
How is that not a deal-breaker?

07:27.406 --> 07:29.200
Because the only spies
without trust issues

07:29.283 --> 07:30.660
are either young or dead.

07:30.743 --> 07:33.538
I hope I can trust Roz. I want to.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.998
That's why I'm bringing her here,
face to face.

07:36.082 --> 07:38.042
So I can look her in the eye and find out.

07:39.877 --> 07:43.589
Meanwhile, the rest of you
will have to go behind her back.

07:52.265 --> 07:54.142
Today, we're launching
Operation Spotlight.

07:54.225 --> 07:58.396
The objective? To peer into
every shadowy corner of the ATCU.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.815
The last few days have been hard.

08:00.898 --> 08:03.276
What happened
with Dr Garner is tragic.

08:03.401 --> 08:06.445
But it has also created
a rare moment of opportunity for us.

08:06.571 --> 08:09.323
The ATCU brought
Dr Garner's containment module

08:09.407 --> 08:10.825
into their research facility.

08:10.908 --> 08:13.870
S.H.I.E.L.D. is going to use that
as a way to gain access.

08:13.953 --> 08:15.913
Going in on the ground
will be Bobbi and Hunter.

08:15.997 --> 08:18.916
Quarterbacking from Zephyr One
will be Daisy and Mack.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.585
Handling extraction, May and...

08:20.668 --> 08:22.086
Him.

08:23.087 --> 08:24.130
Okay...

08:24.463 --> 08:27.466
I guess the new guy will gain
a firsthand look of our operations

08:27.592 --> 08:28.759
with Agent May.

08:28.843 --> 08:30.344
Let me be clear.

08:30.428 --> 08:31.971
I want to know everything.

08:32.096 --> 08:33.181
What's inside the facility,

08:33.264 --> 08:35.308
how close they are
to this cure they've been working on,

08:35.433 --> 08:37.559
which Inhumans they're holding
and where they came from,

08:37.643 --> 08:40.563
and finally, what it is the ATCU
actually wants with them.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.106
- Questions?
- Yeah.

08:43.607 --> 08:44.609
Why now?

08:44.692 --> 08:47.236
Because I think the head
of the ATCU finally trusts me.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.779
I'd like that feeling to be mutual.

08:48.863 --> 08:49.989
Let's get to work.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.329
That answer your concerns?

08:58.122 --> 08:59.874
Just raises all new ones.

09:04.462 --> 09:05.713
You've kept quiet. I admire that.

09:13.054 --> 09:16.015
These babies burn
up to 2,600 degrees.

09:16.140 --> 09:18.476
I was a bit of a pyro when I was a kid.

09:18.976 --> 09:20.311
Got me into some real trouble,

09:21.687 --> 09:25.149
but damn if I don't love
the sound of that gas igniting.

09:37.370 --> 09:40.498
You have to incorporate
what you love into your work.

09:41.499 --> 09:43.668
You see, the trick is

09:43.751 --> 09:46.921
you want 'em to know it's gonna hurt.

09:47.004 --> 09:48.881
Build anticipation.

09:49.006 --> 09:52.385
But you have to let 'em
imagine a better world.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.388
You could walk into
Strucker's vault with me.

09:55.513 --> 09:57.348
You just have to show me how.

09:57.431 --> 10:00.351
We could go in there together.
Share what we find...

10:02.270 --> 10:04.272
You could torture us all you want,
there's nothing to tell.

10:04.355 --> 10:07.024
He uses different people
when he travels to Zepkow,

10:07.441 --> 10:09.694
and even they don't know
where the vault's buried.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.946
Zepkow? Germany.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.576
I lied.

10:18.536 --> 10:20.413
Strucker has many vaults.

10:20.538 --> 10:21.872
I know 'em all.

10:23.291 --> 10:24.959
Just didn't know Zepkow
was the one I needed.

10:28.879 --> 10:31.549
Be proud. You stayed quiet.

10:33.342 --> 10:36.178
You would have
fit in good with my men.

10:43.436 --> 10:45.229
Ms Price.

10:50.276 --> 10:52.445
Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D.

10:54.780 --> 10:58.242
Not exactly running things out of
your mom's basement, are we?

10:58.367 --> 11:00.077
Did you give it a slick code name?

11:00.202 --> 11:02.246
Classified, but to me, it's home.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.414
Oh, that's cute.

11:03.873 --> 11:07.460
Almost as cute as flying me
in circles for six hours on a plane.

11:07.585 --> 11:09.795
I don't know if
I'm in Albuquerque or Albania.

11:10.296 --> 11:11.964
Imagine the possibilities.

11:12.089 --> 11:15.384
And be flattered.
I waived our usual blindfold protocol.

11:15.468 --> 11:18.012
Oh, they'll say you're going soft,
Director.

11:18.095 --> 11:21.474
Then again, completely disabled
my phone for the entire flight.

11:21.599 --> 11:23.642
Couldn't even check
my fantasy football scores.

11:23.768 --> 11:25.227
Such cruelty.

11:25.311 --> 11:27.438
I can reactivate the phone,

11:27.563 --> 11:30.274
but we'll need to sweep
for wireless sniffers first.

11:30.399 --> 11:33.736
Two words I never want to hear again.

11:33.819 --> 11:36.280
Go for it, cowboy.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.451
You left your
intelligence-gathering phone

11:40.576 --> 11:42.036
at your apartment, didn't you?

11:42.119 --> 11:45.373
I almost didn't.
But I thought it might be rude.

11:45.456 --> 11:48.584
Please. We expect nothing less.

11:53.297 --> 11:55.591
Incoming data upload
from Rosalind's phone.

11:55.674 --> 12:00.429
Okay, let's wake up the ATCU IT ASAP.

12:12.358 --> 12:14.193
Oh, yeah, that's my favourite episode.

12:14.318 --> 12:16.529
I mean, Darlene was set up perfectly.
Every word she said...

12:16.654 --> 12:17.655
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.990
Did you see that? What was that?

12:22.201 --> 12:23.994
Did you just hack the ATCU?

12:24.120 --> 12:25.913
No. But the containment
module broadcasts

12:25.996 --> 12:28.249
some pretty intense
encrypted homing signals.

12:28.332 --> 12:29.834
You can put it inside a corporate office,

12:29.959 --> 12:33.003
and it'll wig the IT department out
real good.

12:37.508 --> 12:39.385
FBI Cyber Investigative Task Force.

12:39.510 --> 12:41.971
How may I help you, Mr, uh, Wilson?

12:42.054 --> 12:44.181
What exactly is going on over there?

12:44.306 --> 12:46.934
Well, multiple agencies' servers
have been attacked

12:47.017 --> 12:48.144
in the last few minutes,

12:48.227 --> 12:51.105
and the traffic traces back to your IPs.

12:51.188 --> 12:54.400
We've already dispatched
a Rapid Response Unit to your location.

12:54.525 --> 12:57.403
Please cooperate fully, should be fine.

12:57.528 --> 13:01.240
I can assure you,
they're our absolute best.

13:01.657 --> 13:04.452
Listen, Agent Phillips,
our systems check out perfectly.

13:04.535 --> 13:06.662
Okay, we're showing
no signs of a breach.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.415
I don't think you'll be necessary here.
I think that it was a glitch.

13:09.540 --> 13:12.334
A glitch, yeah.
Of course it looks like a glitch.

13:12.418 --> 13:13.586
That's the point.

13:13.711 --> 13:15.171
You congratulate yourself,

13:15.254 --> 13:16.797
crisis averted,
then go home, never noticing

13:16.881 --> 13:19.425
the polymorphic root kit
buried deep inside your system.

13:19.550 --> 13:21.010
Until hackers activate it to...

13:21.093 --> 13:23.846
...bypass that sweet stateless multi...

13:23.929 --> 13:25.347
...factor authentication...

13:25.431 --> 13:28.559
...code you are so bloody proud of.

13:29.727 --> 13:30.853
Red Sox fan?

13:30.936 --> 13:32.688
Redcoats, actually.

13:33.397 --> 13:35.608
- This guy does not look like FBI.
- He wasn't.

13:35.733 --> 13:38.903
Dane here crashed the Pentagon's
servers, Mossad's, Ashley Madison...

13:39.028 --> 13:40.446
He's the best consultant we have,

13:40.571 --> 13:43.741
otherwise he'd be in jail
or I'd have shot him by now.

13:44.575 --> 13:46.660
If he says that
you have a problem? Listen.

13:46.744 --> 13:48.662
Our system is air-tight.

13:48.746 --> 13:50.831
Yeah. If your system's so secure,

13:50.915 --> 13:52.625
how did your staff's
credentials leak out?

13:52.750 --> 13:54.460
What? No, no, no, no, no. There...

13:54.585 --> 13:56.629
There's no way
someone got past our software.

13:56.754 --> 13:59.673
Who said anything about software?
We think hardware was smuggled in.

13:59.757 --> 14:01.800
You called,
detecting some sort of broadcast?

14:01.926 --> 14:03.552
The ATCU security is way too strict...

14:03.636 --> 14:06.096
Was nothing brought into this facility
in the last 24 hours?

14:06.222 --> 14:08.766
No, our employees' keys
don't make it past security.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.060
We haven't brought in
anything except the, uh...

14:13.562 --> 14:14.980
Oh, no.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.399
I need to make a phone call.

14:19.652 --> 14:21.612
We've had some
major breakthroughs here.

14:21.737 --> 14:25.658
Advances in alien biology,
robotics, prosthetics.

14:25.783 --> 14:27.451
It cuts a hell of a silhouette.

14:27.993 --> 14:29.995
You know, they mostly got it right.

14:32.331 --> 14:34.458
So you did reactivate it.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.753
Hello, IT department that calls me
only when there's a problem.

14:37.836 --> 14:38.879
What's the problem?

14:38.963 --> 14:40.339
There's an FBI task force here.

14:40.464 --> 14:43.300
An energy pulse was detected
inside our facility right before, um,

14:43.801 --> 14:45.010
an apparent security leak.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.345
Have you found the cause?

14:46.470 --> 14:48.722
<i>Well, ma'am, I think it could be
the S.H.I.E.L.D. containment module</i>

14:48.806 --> 14:50.099
<i>we brought in.</i>

14:51.475 --> 14:52.560
Dearest,

14:52.643 --> 14:54.603
is it possible that
your containment module

14:54.687 --> 14:56.897
tried to access the ATCU's system?

14:56.981 --> 14:59.733
Absolutely.
It scans any local network it finds.

14:59.817 --> 15:01.193
All our hardware does.

15:01.318 --> 15:04.154
Well, we noticed, and we're gonna
have to go ahead and shut that down.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.115
Can't blame a guy for trying.

15:07.825 --> 15:08.867
Hey, Steve?

15:08.993 --> 15:11.662
You're supposed to protect the ATCU
from things like this.

15:11.787 --> 15:14.999
<i>So play nice with the FBI's task force,
and fix it.</i>

15:17.042 --> 15:18.544
You're lucky you're cute.

15:18.669 --> 15:21.046
We really have to figure out
other ways to flirt.

15:22.214 --> 15:23.674
Are you alphabetizing those?

15:23.799 --> 15:27.219
Don't be ridiculous. I'm organising
them by subject and date.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.887
No, you're procrastinating.

15:29.013 --> 15:31.599
Is there something so terrible about
a comprehensive system?

15:31.682 --> 15:32.933
Why don't you want to go look into...

15:33.017 --> 15:35.352
I've been looking.
I just don't like what I'm seeing.

15:37.146 --> 15:38.188
You found a lead?

15:41.567 --> 15:44.778
Will wasn't sent on a mission,
he was sacrificed.

15:44.862 --> 15:46.614
The symbol used
for his space programme?

15:46.697 --> 15:51.160
Tied to ritualistic blood sacrifice.
People working with NASA.

15:51.744 --> 15:53.662
Between this and Andrew...

15:53.746 --> 15:56.540
I have that sinking feeling again, Fitz.

15:58.334 --> 16:01.045
That we never really know
who's next to us.

16:08.177 --> 16:11.680
Thank you.
These should keep me warm.

16:11.764 --> 16:13.265
This gonna get you in trouble?

16:13.390 --> 16:15.351
Up here, I control everything.

16:16.393 --> 16:19.480
Always? You never find yourself
completely out of control?

16:19.563 --> 16:22.316
I'll be in Moscow soon enough
with a day off.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.776
Come see for yourself.

16:23.901 --> 16:27.946
I wish I could,
but I'm not going to Moscow.

16:28.072 --> 16:30.949
This was the only flight I could find
passing over Zepkow.

16:52.137 --> 16:53.889
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

16:53.972 --> 16:55.307
<i>please return to your seats</i>

16:55.432 --> 16:56.892
<i>and keep your seatbelts fastened.</i>

16:56.975 --> 16:58.769
<i>You may experience
some turbulence coming up.</i>

16:59.311 --> 17:03.273
<i>Don't be alarmed, that's just your pilot
diving to equalise cabin pressure</i>

17:03.399 --> 17:04.775
<i>before you freeze to death.</i>

17:05.401 --> 17:07.111
<i>Oh, and, uh...</i>

17:07.486 --> 17:11.615
<i>...from all of us here at HYDRA,
thanks for flying the friendly skies.</i>

17:18.747 --> 17:21.208
These symbols trace back
thousands of years.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.420
Groups obsessed with death
and ritualistic killings.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.673
It's intertwined with the origin
of pagan devil myths.

17:27.798 --> 17:30.801
And then suddenly, there they were,
secretly funding NASA missions.

17:30.926 --> 17:34.138
They knew something.
These texts go back a thousand years.

17:34.263 --> 17:36.640
Fitz, there's nothing in here
to help open the portal.

17:36.765 --> 17:37.808
Of course there is.

17:37.933 --> 17:39.768
No. It's just copious examples of
how this group was evil,

17:39.852 --> 17:41.353
and used Will as a blood offering.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.105
But if we can find out their goal,

17:43.188 --> 17:44.523
we can find out
how they tried to achieve it.

17:44.648 --> 17:47.025
Even if we have to stay up all night,
we'll find something.

17:47.151 --> 17:49.319
- Something to help us bring back Will.
- You have to stop.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.364
Excuse me?

17:52.489 --> 17:55.993
Stop. Just stop trying to do
all the right things! It's too much.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.171
Is this a silver tie clip camera?

18:07.296 --> 18:09.089
Platinum. 1963.

18:09.173 --> 18:11.133
Wow. You really are a S.H.I.E.L.D lifer.

18:11.967 --> 18:15.554
I bet there's a story behind each one
of these that I'd love to hear.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.682
I have a real soft spot
for that golden age.

18:19.183 --> 18:20.476
They recruit you out of college?

18:20.684 --> 18:21.685
Mmm-hmm.

18:21.977 --> 18:23.771
- Studying...
- History.

18:23.854 --> 18:26.815
I started to inadvertently uncover
how much of that history

18:26.899 --> 18:28.233
S.H.I.E.L.D. had helped to shape.

18:28.358 --> 18:30.194
So they snatched me up.

18:31.069 --> 18:33.781
So, you've really never
known anyone in S.H.I.E.L.D.?

18:33.864 --> 18:36.033
I find that hard to believe.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.451
Only in passing.

18:37.534 --> 18:40.245
Come on, you can tell me if you have.
I'm the Director.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.955
You're inside our secret base.

18:42.039 --> 18:45.000
You know, I hate to disappoint you, Phil,
but until recently,

18:45.083 --> 18:47.586
I was in the normal intelligence game,
not paranormal.

18:47.711 --> 18:48.921
You're my first.

18:52.674 --> 18:53.717
Hmm.

18:54.760 --> 18:58.847
You know, I gotta admit, I didn't
picture you keeping things so analogue.

18:58.931 --> 19:03.519
Yeah, files, books, vinyl,
there's a tactile benefit.

19:03.602 --> 19:06.230
The way they feel in your hands,
the wear and tear.

19:06.355 --> 19:09.441
Oh, the smell. I love the smell of books.

19:09.566 --> 19:10.609
Helps me think.

19:10.943 --> 19:13.779
Besides, we both know how vulnerable

19:13.904 --> 19:16.281
the digital world is to infiltration.

19:19.368 --> 19:21.954
So sorry, Steve-o,
nothing worse for an IT guy

19:22.079 --> 19:24.915
than someone
logging into your terminal.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.917
Makes you feel violated, doesn't it?

19:27.042 --> 19:29.378
How do we know he's not just looking
for exploits to get into our system

19:29.461 --> 19:30.504
when he goes back
to being a black hat?

19:30.587 --> 19:32.130
Oh, there's no going back for Dane.

19:32.256 --> 19:35.092
But I am here to find the exploits.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.594
And I'm gonna need a login
to determine if...

19:37.719 --> 19:41.431
...the Trojan horse hardware emitted
a signal pulse that allows access...

19:41.557 --> 19:44.476
...through your UDP
or TCP ports, mate.

19:44.601 --> 19:45.936
Have you checked that yet?

19:46.562 --> 19:48.689
You can use a command prompt
to enter a guest username.

19:48.772 --> 19:50.899
And unwittingly give us remote access.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.114
Okay, Hunter. Type this in.

19:57.239 --> 20:02.119
C, colon, forward-slash, "System,"
forward-slash, "Request user."

20:06.081 --> 20:08.458
Hunter? Oh, God.

20:08.584 --> 20:10.460
<i>Hunter, please tell me you know
which one is forward-slash.</i>

20:10.586 --> 20:12.129
Yes. Typing.

20:15.132 --> 20:18.594
I'm just helping
your sluggish code keep up.

20:19.636 --> 20:20.679
Hilarious.

20:20.804 --> 20:22.014
And the username.

20:22.139 --> 20:23.307
Username,

20:23.473 --> 20:28.145
"God Save the Queen."

20:28.270 --> 20:29.646
Yeah, I let him pick it.

20:33.150 --> 20:34.359
Bingo.

20:34.776 --> 20:36.778
May, you're up.

20:39.990 --> 20:42.326
Agent May said she wants you
with her on this, yeah?

20:42.826 --> 20:44.369
- Yeah.
- Well, then, I suggest

20:44.494 --> 20:45.621
you move your ass.

20:51.501 --> 20:52.878
There.

20:53.003 --> 20:55.923
Bobbi. Enhanced Specimen Control.

20:56.006 --> 20:58.300
North, stairs at the end of the hall,

20:58.383 --> 21:00.719
<i>three floors down
in the Science Division.</i>

21:00.844 --> 21:02.512
Ringing your phone now.

21:02.679 --> 21:03.847
Hmm.

21:04.348 --> 21:06.266
My superiors on Pennsylvania Avenue.

21:06.350 --> 21:08.435
I need to step away for a moment
to give them my full report.

21:08.518 --> 21:09.686
Okay.

21:13.398 --> 21:14.483
<i>Check that section.</i>

21:14.566 --> 21:16.443
<i>See how many Inhumans
they're keeping in there.</i>

21:16.526 --> 21:19.154
And grab any samples
of the potential cure.

21:19.237 --> 21:22.032
Now all Hunter has to do is
run his mouth and waste time.

21:22.157 --> 21:23.241
Oh, he excels at that.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.536
Daisy? Thank you.

21:35.212 --> 21:36.421
Here?

21:41.718 --> 21:43.887
So, you need me to do anything?

21:46.181 --> 21:49.267
Why bring me if you're not even
going to talk to me?

21:53.397 --> 21:54.731
Where do you get off?

21:56.233 --> 21:57.526
Are you seriously mad at me?

21:57.609 --> 22:00.779
I'm mad at myself
for roping you into this. It's not fair.

22:00.904 --> 22:03.323
I'm mad that you're so willing to help.

22:03.407 --> 22:06.243
As opposed to what?
What do you expect?

22:06.368 --> 22:07.869
I don't know. Get angry.

22:07.953 --> 22:10.914
I cannot fathom any way out of this
without hurting someone I care about.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.250
Do you think that I'm not angry?

22:13.375 --> 22:15.502
I'm sick to my stomach. I'm furious.

22:15.585 --> 22:18.547
But not at you. 'Cause we're cursed.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.674
The bloody cosmos
wants us to be apart.

22:20.757 --> 22:22.300
The cosmos doesn't want anything.

22:22.426 --> 22:24.136
Yeah, well, I beg to differ.

22:24.261 --> 22:27.681
'Cause we had years, side by side.
Never occurred to us.

22:27.764 --> 22:29.850
And then when it does, we don't have
the courage to talk about it.

22:29.933 --> 22:32.185
You only mentioned it at the bottom
of the sea, facing certain death.

22:32.269 --> 22:34.563
You wait till I'm bound for
a war on an aircraft carrier.

22:34.646 --> 22:38.567
And then you get swept off
to some far-flung planet.

22:38.650 --> 22:39.818
With him.

22:40.402 --> 22:43.238
Top marks, pilot-astronaut-hero-man.

22:43.321 --> 22:44.698
I would do anything...

22:44.781 --> 22:45.824
Do you love him?

22:49.119 --> 22:51.163
I don't know, I think...

22:52.789 --> 22:53.832
Yes.

22:56.334 --> 22:57.753
Yeah.

22:57.836 --> 22:59.629
Yeah, of course, you do.
Of course, you do.

22:59.755 --> 23:01.006
He's strong and smart

23:01.131 --> 23:02.424
and you gave each other hope
on the edge of nowhere.

23:02.507 --> 23:03.759
Don't do this, Fitz.

23:03.842 --> 23:07.929
You think I didn't look for dirt on him?
I did. And there's nothing.

23:08.472 --> 23:09.598
I can't hate him, he's great.

23:09.681 --> 23:11.641
Why else would you fall for him?
He did everything right.

23:11.767 --> 23:14.811
And you dove through a hole
in the universe for me!

23:38.502 --> 23:39.795
We're cursed.

23:49.012 --> 23:50.847
Fitz, is that what I think it is?

24:11.743 --> 24:15.539
Andrew was a PhD in Psychology,
now he's a specimen.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.209
Open sesame.

24:32.556 --> 24:35.600
Dr Garner.
I'm so sorry about everything.

24:35.725 --> 24:38.228
No one warned me
there would be a flight.

24:38.728 --> 24:39.771
Who are you?

24:39.896 --> 24:43.275
I'm Gideon Malick.
I advise the President's staff.

24:44.067 --> 24:46.486
And I want to assure you
that we're working with S.H.I.E.L.D.

24:46.570 --> 24:49.030
to do everything we can to help you.

24:49.114 --> 24:50.574
With what? A cure?

24:50.699 --> 24:52.951
I know how pharmaceuticals work.

24:53.076 --> 24:55.412
What are you,
a decade away from treatment?

24:57.205 --> 25:00.250
It strikes me that no one's asked
if you even want treatment.

25:00.917 --> 25:04.296
They haven't asked your opinion
on the situation at all, have they?

25:06.631 --> 25:07.716
No.

25:10.260 --> 25:11.887
But then, all they see

25:13.763 --> 25:15.223
is a killer.

25:15.307 --> 25:17.309
Well, surely,
you have taken a hard stance.

25:17.434 --> 25:20.187
But then,
this is an invading alien contagion,

25:20.270 --> 25:22.981
which S.H.I.E.L.D.
has known about for quite some time.

25:23.982 --> 25:25.817
They protected no one. Including you.

25:25.942 --> 25:28.236
There's more nuance
to S.H.I.E.L.D. than that.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.779
Why worry about them?

25:29.905 --> 25:32.407
S.H.I.E.L.D. has good intentions
but questionable methods.

25:32.490 --> 25:34.326
That much is true.

25:34.826 --> 25:36.620
They can't help themselves

25:36.745 --> 25:39.247
from jumping into the deep end
of dangerous waters.

25:39.331 --> 25:44.085
We agree on more than we don't.
I can help you, Dr Garner.

25:44.169 --> 25:48.173
But first, I need to know what else
S.H.I.E.L.D. has been hiding from us.

25:49.424 --> 25:51.218
<i>Andrew isn't here.</i>

25:51.301 --> 25:52.802
Guys.
Are you sure this is the right area?

25:53.470 --> 25:54.554
<i>That's the place.</i>

25:54.638 --> 25:58.391
Well, there are no Inhumans being
held here. Let Coulson know.

25:58.475 --> 26:00.227
And as far as a cure,

26:00.310 --> 26:04.439
it doesn't look like they're taking
tissue samples, studying cell response.

26:04.522 --> 26:05.649
<i>Not in here anyway.</i>

26:05.774 --> 26:08.902
If they're not working on a cure
in there, then what are they doing?

26:08.985 --> 26:13.573
Wait. Daisy, anything on medications
they've compiled for study?

26:13.657 --> 26:16.660
'Cause I'm not positive, but those look
an awful lot like fish oil pills.

26:16.785 --> 26:18.119
<i>I'll look.</i>

26:27.671 --> 26:30.340
There's no better time
to be a hacker, really.

26:30.465 --> 26:32.300
I mean, nowadays,
every human on the planet,

26:32.384 --> 26:35.136
kids, have computers
in their pockets, you know?

26:35.220 --> 26:37.514
Instead of stealing candy from a baby,

26:37.639 --> 26:39.683
you're stealing their parent's
credit card information.

26:39.808 --> 26:42.310
- Okay. I'm going to grab some coffee.
- Mmm-hmm.

26:43.478 --> 26:46.147
I'll have a cup of tea, please.

26:46.231 --> 26:47.732
Thanks.

26:49.192 --> 26:50.485
Oh, bollocks.

26:50.694 --> 26:54.698
Uh, people, time to download everything
we can and make our getaway.

26:54.823 --> 26:56.616
Our friend Mr Banks
has just showed up

26:56.700 --> 26:58.952
and I do not have a handkerchief
to cover my face.

26:59.035 --> 27:00.829
And that would be weird anyhow.

27:00.912 --> 27:02.289
Copy that.

27:02.372 --> 27:05.709
They're not studying medication, Bobbi.
They're administering them.

27:05.834 --> 27:09.337
Giving mandatory supplements
to all their employees.

27:09.421 --> 27:11.548
To "prevent infection."

27:12.882 --> 27:14.718
<i>Soldiers, office workers.</i>

27:15.051 --> 27:18.596
Hold on, it says,
"And any public witnesses."

27:20.056 --> 27:21.182
Oh, no.

27:21.599 --> 27:23.018
<i>They're playing the odds.</i>

27:23.101 --> 27:25.478
Giving Terrigen to as many people
as they can.

27:25.562 --> 27:27.272
<i>They're not trying to cure Inhumans...</i>

27:27.397 --> 27:28.565
They're turning them.

27:33.862 --> 27:34.946
Hmm.

27:44.414 --> 27:47.208
Do you expect me to stay
in this room overnight, Phil?

27:47.292 --> 27:49.753
'Cause I might need a little persuading.

27:49.878 --> 27:51.796
No, it's you who needs to convince me.

27:51.921 --> 27:54.257
- Convince you?
- That you're not HYDRA.

28:01.473 --> 28:03.767
Otherwise, you're never leaving
this room again.

28:06.394 --> 28:07.854
What the hell are you doing, Phil?

28:07.937 --> 28:09.522
Getting the truth out of you
once and for all.

28:09.606 --> 28:10.690
Is this a joke?

28:10.774 --> 28:11.941
I'm not laughing.

28:12.108 --> 28:13.943
What, you think
there's some hidden secret

28:14.069 --> 28:15.445
you can just scare out of me?

28:15.570 --> 28:17.530
I have my people
infiltrating your facility,

28:17.614 --> 28:19.240
I'm getting the truth regardless.

28:19.324 --> 28:20.867
So this is your final chance
to come clean.

28:20.950 --> 28:23.536
They won't find anything out
that I wouldn't happily tell them.

28:23.620 --> 28:25.955
What's wrong with you? Stop lying!

28:26.081 --> 28:27.707
Why don't you tell me
who you really are,

28:27.791 --> 28:29.459
who you work for
and what you're hiding.

28:29.584 --> 28:31.044
What the hell is wrong with you?
Look at you.

28:31.127 --> 28:33.671
- I'm done playing games.
- I wasn't playing games.

28:33.797 --> 28:37.384
I thought... I thought there was
something between us.

28:37.467 --> 28:41.262
Something real, that wasn't just based
on this spy-craft manipulation crap.

28:41.346 --> 28:43.390
You really think this emotional
appeal is gonna work right now?

28:43.473 --> 28:45.600
No, because you have no emotions.

28:47.352 --> 28:49.312
This was all a plan?

28:49.437 --> 28:52.774
To sleep with me,
gain trust and take advantage?

28:52.857 --> 28:54.234
Don't try to talk your way out of this.

28:54.317 --> 28:57.946
Or even sadder,
you didn't plan to sleep with me,

28:59.322 --> 29:00.573
but you just have such deep issues that

29:00.657 --> 29:02.409
you stopped trusting me
as soon as you did.

29:02.492 --> 29:03.618
You lied to me.

29:03.868 --> 29:06.663
Andrew isn't being kept
at your ATCU facility, is he?

29:08.498 --> 29:10.333
Of course not.

29:14.170 --> 29:16.548
Are you torturing me, is that the idea?

29:16.673 --> 29:19.217
Dragging me around,
waiting for the other shoe to drop.

29:19.342 --> 29:20.718
I know how dangerous you are.

29:22.679 --> 29:26.766
But if you blame me for bringing out
the monster in that man,

29:26.850 --> 29:28.893
I'm not apologising for that.

29:32.063 --> 29:34.774
I've been trying
to figure out what to say.

29:34.858 --> 29:38.194
Because I do want to apologise. To you.

29:39.529 --> 29:41.030
For Andrew.

29:41.573 --> 29:45.076
He killed your friends in cold blood.
Tried to kill you.

29:47.328 --> 29:48.580
I'm sorry.

29:50.165 --> 29:51.541
I should've known.

29:54.502 --> 29:55.712
I should be thanking you.

29:56.504 --> 29:59.215
For being willing to put those bullets
in him when you did.

30:00.258 --> 30:02.427
<i>May. Bobbi and Hunter may
need extraction</i>

30:02.552 --> 30:04.762
<i>sooner than we thought.</i>

30:09.601 --> 30:11.186
Can't charm my way out of this one.

30:11.769 --> 30:13.938
Hunter. I need you to get down here.

30:14.063 --> 30:16.608
<i>Bring me my briefcase.</i>

30:16.733 --> 30:18.693
<i>- Hunter?</i>
- Almost finished?

30:18.776 --> 30:21.613
Yeah, things have gotten really
complicated in here just now.

30:21.738 --> 30:24.491
Um, listen, Steve,
you seem like a really good guy,

30:24.574 --> 30:26.367
and you were spot on about
not being able to trust me,

30:26.451 --> 30:27.994
just wrong about why.

30:28.077 --> 30:29.412
See, I'm not very good at computers.

30:30.580 --> 30:31.915
Ahhh!

30:37.921 --> 30:39.589
Now, now, now!

30:51.935 --> 30:53.144
I'm gonna need that briefcase.

30:53.269 --> 30:55.271
Coming as fast as I can, love.

30:56.439 --> 30:58.983
Of course we don't keep Inhumans
at that facility.

30:59.108 --> 31:02.612
We can't risk some duplicitous nutcase
breaking in to look around.

31:02.737 --> 31:04.739
- Looks like we made the right move.
- You're always one step ahead.

31:04.822 --> 31:06.449
I feel like an idiot,
that I thought you were different.

31:06.574 --> 31:07.992
Stop with the mind games!

31:08.117 --> 31:11.579
I'll admit, you're good.
Pretending to fall for me,

31:11.663 --> 31:14.082
well enough that
I actually went along for the ride.

31:14.165 --> 31:17.794
But in the back of my mind, I always
had one finger on the eject button.

31:17.919 --> 31:20.171
That's because you're incapable
of anything else.

31:20.296 --> 31:23.216
No, because you slipped up.

31:23.299 --> 31:26.594
Tahiti. The first time we met,
you tried to get under my skin,

31:26.678 --> 31:28.263
talking about Tahiti.

31:28.346 --> 31:29.931
So I was hoping against all hope

31:30.014 --> 31:32.767
that today you'd confirm a high-level
source from within S.H.I.E.L.D.,

31:32.850 --> 31:33.893
but you claim you have none...

31:33.977 --> 31:35.353
That's because I've been honest.

31:35.478 --> 31:37.355
But the only other possible way
that you could know about that

31:37.480 --> 31:39.274
is if you got your intel from HYDRA.

31:39.357 --> 31:40.567
So why don't you share your source?

31:40.650 --> 31:43.111
I'm not sharing anything
with you any more.

31:43.194 --> 31:45.154
I didn't think so.

31:49.450 --> 31:51.703
Except for this. You know what?

31:51.828 --> 31:56.040
To be honest,
I did fall for you, Phil. I did.

31:56.165 --> 31:58.418
But it turns out, you're impenetrable.

31:58.501 --> 32:01.462
You like to joke about your robot hand,
and not being human...

32:01.546 --> 32:02.714
I'm not sure you're so off the mark.

32:02.839 --> 32:04.382
Yeah, that means a lot
coming from you.

32:04.507 --> 32:05.842
You were stabbed through the heart.

32:05.967 --> 32:08.469
You must derive sadistic pleasure
in doing the same to others.

32:08.553 --> 32:10.805
At least I didn't use the story of
my dead husband to sell the idea

32:10.888 --> 32:12.807
that the ATCU was working on a cure.

32:12.890 --> 32:15.018
- When we both know that's a lie.
- How dare you mention...

32:15.143 --> 32:16.477
Oh, cut the melodrama.

32:16.561 --> 32:19.355
My agent at the centre
of your compound confirmed

32:19.480 --> 32:21.024
that you're not trying to cure Inhumans,

32:21.107 --> 32:22.817
you're making as many as you can.

32:24.193 --> 32:25.862
What are you talking about?

32:25.945 --> 32:28.865
Enhanced Specimen Control.

32:28.948 --> 32:31.701
They're inside, Roz.
So you know what they found.

32:31.826 --> 32:35.788
No. No one's allowed on those floors.
For risk of infection.

32:35.872 --> 32:37.040
Intentional infection.

32:37.165 --> 32:39.792
I got to admit, handing out
the contaminant as the cure...

32:39.876 --> 32:41.377
- No, that's not what we...
- That's especially sinister.

32:41.502 --> 32:43.338
No, I get weekly reports from...

32:43.880 --> 32:45.965
- From Malick.
- Excuse me?

32:47.300 --> 32:48.968
- Gideon Malick.
- I know the name.

32:49.052 --> 32:51.471
Industrialist. He served
on the World Council.

32:51.554 --> 32:54.724
He's a friend. I've worked with him
more than a decade.

32:54.849 --> 32:58.728
He advises the President's staff,
helped design the ATCU.

32:58.811 --> 33:02.065
Oversees the Science Division.

33:06.861 --> 33:09.739
He gave me the Tahiti intel.

33:12.909 --> 33:14.577
Connection is down.

33:14.702 --> 33:16.579
Look. Last file we pulled.

33:16.663 --> 33:19.832
A catalogue of all the Inhumans
they turned and put into stasis. But...

33:19.916 --> 33:22.543
Let me guess.
They didn't put them all in stasis.

33:33.054 --> 33:35.431
Oh, once again, too little and too late.

33:35.515 --> 33:37.183
I'll remind you that
we're basically the same height,

33:37.266 --> 33:39.227
I just don't wear bloody heels.

33:55.576 --> 33:59.956
Aliens. I pine for the days where
we didn't have to fight bloody aliens.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.125
It's just not a fair fight.

34:03.251 --> 34:04.961
Let's see if we can
level the playing field.

34:05.712 --> 34:08.464
Really? Your batons?
That's your game changer?

34:19.976 --> 34:21.811
Well, all right then.

34:34.907 --> 34:35.908
Let me make a call to my people.

34:35.992 --> 34:38.161
Your people...
Yeah, I don't see that happening.

34:38.286 --> 34:41.914
If Malick went to these lengths,
your agents are in serious danger.

34:41.998 --> 34:43.166
- I can get them out.
- Or sell them out.

34:43.291 --> 34:45.001
Phil, look at me.

34:45.126 --> 34:47.587
Please believe
that I don't know what's going on.

34:47.670 --> 34:49.172
We need answers, both of us.

34:49.297 --> 34:52.425
And if you don't let me get on the phone
right now, we lose everything.

35:12.195 --> 35:13.279
Oh!

35:13.362 --> 35:15.031
That'll buy us very little time.

35:19.035 --> 35:20.870
Come with me. I'll get you out of here.

35:22.288 --> 35:25.958
If you're worried you can't trust me,
worry on the move.

35:29.796 --> 35:32.381
He'll lead them
to the northwest parking lot.

35:32.465 --> 35:33.716
You hear that?

35:33.800 --> 35:35.176
<i>May is en route.</i>

35:38.846 --> 35:41.015
I don't see them.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.233
Got them.

36:03.037 --> 36:04.664
I'm hardly ever impressed.

36:04.747 --> 36:06.666
I've shaken hands with presidents,

36:06.749 --> 36:09.585
held technology from other planets.

36:10.753 --> 36:13.506
Didn't really faze me.
But I got to tell you,

36:13.589 --> 36:15.216
I'm at a loss for words.

36:16.342 --> 36:17.844
You left me to die.

36:17.927 --> 36:20.763
I left those men there to kill you.

36:20.847 --> 36:22.849
But you,
you cut through them like cake.

36:22.932 --> 36:26.102
Then to locate this place,
much less get here...

36:26.227 --> 36:27.353
Phew!

36:28.855 --> 36:30.940
I only got here
a few minutes before you,

36:31.065 --> 36:32.775
and I have my own jet.

36:33.943 --> 36:35.611
This was all just a test?

36:35.695 --> 36:37.947
No, I wanted you dead.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.615
You pose a legitimate threat

36:40.616 --> 36:42.451
to everything that I've built.

36:43.870 --> 36:45.037
But now...

36:46.122 --> 36:48.124
Now, I'm beginning to think that maybe

36:48.249 --> 36:50.293
I was looking at it from the wrong angle.

36:52.420 --> 36:55.965
You just might be
HYDRA's second head

36:57.091 --> 36:59.886
that's grown right next to me.

36:59.969 --> 37:01.888
I should kill you.

37:03.764 --> 37:06.309
Then you'd miss that history
lesson we've been talking about.

37:09.312 --> 37:14.317
I know you're all about
rebooting HYDRA and all that,

37:14.442 --> 37:18.112
but do you know much
about our history? Our origin?

37:20.239 --> 37:21.240
Yeah.

37:21.324 --> 37:23.242
World War II. Red Skull.

37:23.326 --> 37:25.912
He used Nazi funding
to build this whole empire.

37:25.995 --> 37:27.079
Oh, no, no.

37:27.163 --> 37:30.958
Red Skull was following the principle
that HYDRA was built upon.

37:31.334 --> 37:35.004
That the ultimate power
is not of this world.

37:35.129 --> 37:36.172
But HYDRA...

37:38.007 --> 37:41.010
Well, we're much, much older than that.

37:47.808 --> 37:49.143
HYDRA's actually

37:49.810 --> 37:51.771
as ancient as this stone.

37:57.360 --> 38:00.112
This one here and the other
surviving stones like it

38:00.196 --> 38:03.282
have been passed down
for a hundred generations.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.368
Keep your eye on it, Mr Ward.

38:05.493 --> 38:08.204
You don't want to miss it
when it does its thing.

38:08.329 --> 38:11.040
This was cut from a much larger stone.

38:11.666 --> 38:16.003
A monolith
that possesses otherworldly properties.

38:17.046 --> 38:18.297
Literally.

38:19.382 --> 38:21.300
It's a portal to another world.

38:21.384 --> 38:22.385
<i>He recruited me in '01.</i>

38:23.469 --> 38:26.055
I met him when his company
was consulting on a programme at...

38:26.180 --> 38:27.556
At NASA?

38:27.640 --> 38:28.891
Yes. How did you...

38:41.404 --> 38:42.822
<i>Thousands of years ago,</i>

38:43.864 --> 38:47.827
an Inhuman was born on this planet
that was destined to rule it.

38:47.910 --> 38:50.329
So powerful, so fearsome,

38:50.413 --> 38:53.749
that others were consumed with dread,
and so they banished it from the Earth,

38:53.874 --> 38:57.545
sent it through the portal
to a distant planet.

39:03.384 --> 39:06.178
HYDRA was founded
with the sole purpose

39:06.262 --> 39:08.431
<i>of engineering its return.</i>

39:10.099 --> 39:14.353
<i>Over generations,
HYDRA has taken different shapes.</i>

39:15.938 --> 39:19.567
<i>The entity has been
given different names.</i>

39:27.074 --> 39:28.617
<i>But every generation</i>

39:28.743 --> 39:31.120
has sent men through the portal,

39:32.204 --> 39:34.790
hoping to save, or at least serve,

39:35.124 --> 39:37.376
our leader on the other side.

39:37.460 --> 39:42.298
Now, we're building an army for it
to command when it returns,

39:42.381 --> 39:45.259
and you and I will rule beside it.

39:47.636 --> 39:48.888
Okay.

39:49.388 --> 39:52.391
That's, uh, a lot to take in.

39:54.810 --> 39:57.396
Well, it's a tall tale, I know.

40:00.149 --> 40:02.068
And why exactly should
I believe a word of it?

40:02.943 --> 40:04.987
Because we're closer than ever
to the final chapter.

40:05.071 --> 40:06.489
We're gonna write it ourselves.

40:06.614 --> 40:08.491
But you don't have to believe me.

40:08.991 --> 40:10.326
I know you want revenge,

40:10.409 --> 40:12.411
to cut the head off
of S.H.I.E.L.D., watch it writhe.

40:12.495 --> 40:13.913
I'll help you do that.

40:13.996 --> 40:15.748
And in return?

40:15.831 --> 40:17.625
You'll help me learn

40:18.793 --> 40:22.088
how S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to achieve
something with the portal

40:22.171 --> 40:26.634
that HYDRA, in thousands of years,
has never been able to accomplish.

40:27.259 --> 40:29.095
And what is that?

40:29.637 --> 40:31.305
They brought someone back.

40:38.062 --> 40:39.230
Hey!

40:42.066 --> 40:45.152
Hey! Someone want to fill me in?

40:45.236 --> 40:48.197
How long you gonna keep me in here
without any idea of what's going on?

40:48.280 --> 40:51.117
No, no, no, no, no, no!
I don't need to be sedated any more.

40:51.200 --> 40:55.496
I just need to talk to someone
about what's going on.

40:56.664 --> 40:57.790
All right,

40:59.250 --> 41:00.960
let's talk.

41:02.253 --> 41:04.088
I could use a session with you, Doc.

41:04.171 --> 41:07.550
I seem to be carrying around
a lot of baggage these days.

41:07.633 --> 41:09.885
It's nice to finally meet you.

41:09.969 --> 41:12.054
- My name is Grant...
- I know who you are.

41:12.138 --> 41:13.264
What are you doing here?

41:13.347 --> 41:15.266
Learning.

41:15.349 --> 41:18.561
It's been a good few days,
educating myself.

41:18.644 --> 41:20.688
Now we get to learn about you.

41:20.771 --> 41:23.440
You feel powerful behind this glass?

41:23.524 --> 41:27.611
Well, you're going to die
with a hole in your chest.

41:27.695 --> 41:30.531
You can try to sedate me,
but I promise you...

41:30.614 --> 41:32.116
Oh, no, no, no, no.

41:32.199 --> 41:35.244
No, this isn't the sedation compound
from S.H.I.E.L.D.

41:35.327 --> 41:38.581
This is chloroethyl sulphide...

41:39.039 --> 41:42.334
Something. It's basically mustard gas.

41:42.418 --> 41:45.963
You see, S.H.I.E.L.D.
showed us how to turn the monster off.

41:46.714 --> 41:49.633
Now we want to know
how to turn that back on.

41:52.052 --> 41:54.221
Oh, uh, I also wanted to thank you.

41:54.305 --> 41:57.641
For helping me find closure.

41:57.725 --> 42:02.855
You see, I thought I knew all the best
ways to bring Melinda pain,

42:04.481 --> 42:06.817
but you...

42:10.279 --> 42:13.824
May thinks I'm a monster,
but you actually become one.

42:14.491 --> 42:15.743
Ahhh!

42:15.826 --> 42:18.037
I guess we know her type.
