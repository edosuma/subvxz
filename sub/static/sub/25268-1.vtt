00:58.392 --> 01:00.659
1941 was a momentous year

01:00.661 --> 01:05.063
in the history of the small
industrial city of Belfast.

01:05.066 --> 01:07.266
It's remembered
by many as the year

01:07.268 --> 01:08.834
war came to our shores,

01:08.836 --> 01:12.471
bringing horrific terror
and unimaginable destruction.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.442
But not for me,

01:17.278 --> 01:20.345
Tom Hall.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.848
And that's because the
contents of a wooden crate

01:22.850 --> 01:25.617
making its way across
the sea to our shores

01:25.619 --> 01:28.287
was about to make that year

01:28.289 --> 01:32.424
simply the most unforgettable
year of my life.

03:42.823 --> 03:46.592
The zoo is closed today,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.662
Yes, just while we settle
the elephant.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.397
Come back another day.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.966
No, no, you got no business
being here today.

03:53.968 --> 03:57.336
Off you go. Not today.
Not today, moppet.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.604
Moppet.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.306
Goodbye.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.842
Goodbye.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.783
Would you like to meet him?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.485
Come on.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.343
He's perfect.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.991
Is he okay?

06:03.797 --> 06:05.530
Just fine.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.802
Oh.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.071
You're the first person
he's done that to.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.806
Got a special touch, eh?

06:14.808 --> 06:16.575
Chip off the old block?

06:16.577 --> 06:18.744
Special touch indeed.

06:18.746 --> 06:22.047
This one's had a difficult
time where he's come from,

06:22.049 --> 06:24.049
and needs considerable
attention.

06:24.051 --> 06:27.052
And that's what we do best
here in Belfast Zoo.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.854
Sir, Tom has a name for him.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.457
Buster.

06:32.459 --> 06:34.726
Well, yes, I-I-I suppose
we needed someone to name him.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.895
Nobody better I'd say, eh, sir?

06:36.897 --> 06:39.131
Yes, quite, yes.

06:39.133 --> 06:41.400
Oh, well, very well, then.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.702
Carry on.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.209
I knew you'd choose Buster.

07:26.713 --> 07:29.448
Orders have been
issued this evening at 1600 hours

07:29.450 --> 07:31.016
as a precaution,

07:31.018 --> 07:33.018
calling up officers
and men of the Anti-Aircraft

07:33.020 --> 07:36.588
and coast defense units
of the Territorial Army.

07:36.590 --> 07:40.192
This is, as yet, not a measure
of general mobilization

07:40.194 --> 07:41.827
to include the Territorial Army.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.063
As a further precaution,

07:45.065 --> 07:47.499
officers and men on leave
from the Royal Air Force

07:47.501 --> 07:49.935
and the defense units
of the Auxiliary Air Force,

07:49.937 --> 07:51.670
and also the Observer Corps...

08:01.548 --> 08:03.515
There's no use crying.

08:04.985 --> 08:08.253
Every morning
we'll be doing this drill.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.156
I expect everyone
to be in attendance.

08:11.158 --> 08:15.260
Bombs or no bombs,
this school remains open.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.663
War does not halt education.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.699
Any questions?

08:22.202 --> 08:24.569
Uncle Hughie's going off
to win the war, sir.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.204
That's great, Peter.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.973
I'm sure there'll be
lots of men...

08:27.975 --> 08:30.175
Auntie Ethna says
she'll be glad at the peace.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.110
We all want peace.

08:32.111 --> 08:34.513
Oh, no, sir.
She means from Uncle Hughie.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.251
Right. No more silliness now,
Peter.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.097
Have you not heard?

08:53.667 --> 08:54.766
We've been called up.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.668
I go Friday.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.579
This happened to me
when I was your age.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.715
My Grandpa Bill went off to war.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.586
He sat me down, too.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.959
I'll be coming home in no time.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.897
Grandpa didn't.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.043
Look after him for me,
won't you?

10:11.244 --> 10:13.612
I'd say a couple of tons or so.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.680
He's just a small one.

10:15.682 --> 10:16.982
Still, you're in charge?

10:16.984 --> 10:18.984
Ow!
Ah!

10:22.255 --> 10:25.357
So this is new elephant I heard
you lying all about, Hall?

10:26.627 --> 10:28.059
Leave him alone.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.828
You need a girl
to save you, Hall?

10:29.830 --> 10:31.863
Just leave him.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.798
Or what?
You'll tell your DA?

10:36.069 --> 10:37.869
Piss-head the drunk.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.037
Classic.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.642
Well, Hall?

10:43.644 --> 10:46.111
I've been asked to look after
an animal too.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.983
What happened to it?

10:51.985 --> 10:53.718
We found it outside Wi...

10:54.421 --> 10:56.187
I killed it,

10:56.189 --> 10:57.722
what happened.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.091
Outside witch woman's house.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.760
She'll hardly miss

11:01.762 --> 11:03.928
one of her millions
of stinking animals.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.064
Let's leave this weirdo.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.410
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

11:45.439 --> 11:47.439
Oi, oi! Get
back here, you toe rag!

11:47.441 --> 11:49.107
Hi, Charlie!

11:54.047 --> 11:55.280
Hey, Adam. Hey, John.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.882
Hello, Tom!
Hello!

12:02.989 --> 12:04.289
Come here, Gilbert.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.124
Come on.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.826
That's it.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.861
Still got it, old boy.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.433
Hey. Hey.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.048
Like that, don't you?

12:31.184 --> 12:33.084
All right. Here we are.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.021
What are you doing in here?

12:37.924 --> 12:39.290
Oh, this is Jake.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.526
He's replacing your father.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.828
Apprentice vet, Lockleys.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.196
Nice to meet you.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.931
Here for Buster?

12:46.933 --> 12:48.833
Proper vet, Tom.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.135
Apprentice.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.772
What's that?

12:53.774 --> 12:55.306
It's medicine.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.041
You allow him in here, sir?

12:58.311 --> 13:00.378
Dad said he's fine.
Well...

13:00.380 --> 13:02.847
one a day keeps the doc away.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.384
Do you want me to...?

13:06.386 --> 13:09.387
This isn't some wee
pet rabbit, son.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.256
Now, give us our cloth.

13:18.532 --> 13:20.532
Dad usually does it by...

13:22.469 --> 13:24.969
This one isn't backward
at coming forward.

13:27.073 --> 13:30.141
Dad always warms it up first.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.589
Behind that door

13:44.591 --> 13:47.258
is a real-life witch.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.027
Listen.

13:53.433 --> 13:58.269
Her house is full of stinking
animals and birds.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.971
And you know what?

13:59.973 --> 14:01.940
She keeps them for one reason.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.175
For eating.

14:04.177 --> 14:09.347
She eats them birds,
rats, rabbits, the lot.

14:09.349 --> 14:13.585
Now you are going to throw that
against her door right now.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.458
Throw it.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.131
It's not safe out here,
little fella.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.945
Mrs. Austin?

15:13.947 --> 15:15.246
Hello?

15:16.182 --> 15:18.116
Hello, Mrs. Austin?

15:21.354 --> 15:22.620
Shoo, bunny.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.165
Hello?

16:12.072 --> 16:14.005
Lovely ones.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.642
What...? Who are you?

16:17.644 --> 16:20.745
I'm... I'm Tom.
Tom Hall.

16:20.747 --> 16:21.980
Get out.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.383
Trespasser, get out.

16:25.385 --> 16:28.353
But your door pushed open.
It can't have. Get out.

16:30.757 --> 16:33.024
I was just returning
your guinea pig.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.060
You evil...

16:36.062 --> 16:37.662
No, I didn't.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.064
I would never harm an animal.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.566
Mrs. Austin!

16:43.103 --> 16:45.169
I just thought
you'd like it back.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.335
Not you again.

17:51.337 --> 17:52.837
But I've got money.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.121
Hey.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.491
Go on. Enjoy them.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.869
Won't be here much longer.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.860
I was worried
about you last night.

18:48.862 --> 18:50.495
Were you frightened?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.402
We've a lot to organize today.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.605
Yes, I'm afraid so.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.375
Why aren't you at school?

19:04.377 --> 19:06.444
Are the animals
being moved or something?

19:06.446 --> 19:07.845
Charlie said...
Tom.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.547
Go now, please.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.349
Your father doesn't work
here anymore.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.283
What are you doing?

19:45.285 --> 19:46.851
Oh...

19:47.754 --> 19:49.687
tying grass or something.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.205
You really in charge
of that new elephant?

20:07.207 --> 20:08.539
Aye.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.908
My dad's away to war.

20:19.519 --> 20:20.518
What's your dad do?

20:21.854 --> 20:24.722
He...

20:24.724 --> 20:25.957
he's going to war, too.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.364
Want to see a picture?

20:36.369 --> 20:37.401
Picture of what?

20:38.705 --> 20:39.670
Picture.

20:40.974 --> 20:43.975
In the picture house.

20:43.977 --> 20:45.743
You've never seen a picture
on the big screen?

20:47.947 --> 20:49.747
You coming or what?

21:01.894 --> 21:03.961
Today was, beyond question,

21:03.963 --> 21:05.863
the most costly for
the German Air Force

21:05.865 --> 21:07.498
for nearly a month.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.468
Up to 10:00 this morning,
175 German aircraft

21:10.470 --> 21:13.804
have been destroyed
in raids over this country.

21:13.806 --> 21:17.408
Approximately 400 enemy aircraft
were launched

21:17.410 --> 21:19.043
in two devastating attacks

21:19.045 --> 21:21.579
against London
and southeast England.

21:21.581 --> 21:25.483
Officials estimate over half of
them were successfully shot down.

21:42.035 --> 21:44.368
Oh, I-I better...

21:44.370 --> 21:45.903
Yeah.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.484
Get in that house, ye!

22:25.978 --> 22:28.045
You keep your damn piehole shut.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.980
What?
You know what.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.682
Last night.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.618
You saw my brother, you turd.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.887
Nobody knows about him.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.889
I won't tell.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.957
The list from
the Ministry is as follows.

23:12.959 --> 23:16.093
The hyena, the wolves,

23:16.095 --> 23:18.429
the puma, the tiger,

23:18.431 --> 23:21.565
the black bear,
the Barbary lion,

23:21.567 --> 23:24.869
the polar bear,
the lynx and the giant rat.

23:24.871 --> 23:27.405
Over.

23:33.513 --> 23:35.913
What's happening?
Zoo's closed today, son.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.616
Charlie, what are they doing?

23:38.618 --> 23:40.117
Potentially dangerous animals

23:40.119 --> 23:41.819
must be destroyed.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.053
No.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.424
Please, you have to stop them.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.628
Back away, son!

23:51.631 --> 23:53.931
Charlie!

23:55.601 --> 23:56.734
Buster.
Hey!

23:56.736 --> 23:58.135
Hey, you can't go up there!

23:58.137 --> 23:59.770
What'd you say, Alpha?

23:59.772 --> 24:01.739
Say again.
Repeat, say again.

24:01.741 --> 24:03.007
Over.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.535
This is 23 Alpha,

24:31.537 --> 24:32.837
receiving you
loud and clear, over.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.238
All zookeepers

24:34.240 --> 24:35.973
have been fully briefed,

24:35.975 --> 24:39.043
and the veterinarian
will confirm all kills.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.778
Standby for further orders.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.546
No!

24:56.863 --> 24:58.529
Buster.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.743
No.

25:19.652 --> 25:20.985
Buster.

25:20.987 --> 25:23.087
Buster. Buster.

25:24.557 --> 25:26.090
Buster.

25:32.665 --> 25:35.533
It's okay, Buster.
It's okay. I'm here now.

25:37.136 --> 25:40.738
So, what do we do with Buster?

25:40.740 --> 25:43.741
He wasn't on the list,
but it doesn't look good.

25:44.810 --> 25:47.845
Shh, Buster.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.747
You have to be quiet now.

25:52.618 --> 25:54.051
Get out.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.986
You stay away.

25:55.988 --> 25:58.689
I saw you. You killer.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.592
It was a government directive.

26:01.594 --> 26:03.961
We had to do it in case the animals
escaped during the bombings.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.163
If they bomb again,
you'll bring the guns back?

26:06.165 --> 26:09.800
Will you?
Tom, I have to follow orders.

26:09.802 --> 26:12.236
Stay away from me and Buster.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.239
Why didn't you go to war?

26:16.175 --> 26:18.075
Too frightened?

26:18.077 --> 26:22.046
Only thing you can shoot
is poor, defenseless animals?

26:22.048 --> 26:23.981
You don't know shit, boy.

26:25.284 --> 26:26.784
Now, get the hell out of here.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.987
What are you going to do?

26:29.989 --> 26:32.723
Shoot me too? Go on.

26:32.725 --> 26:35.826
If anything happens to Buster,

26:35.828 --> 26:37.361
anything,

26:37.363 --> 26:39.730
I promise...

27:01.621 --> 27:04.221
Emily? I saw your Tom
at the entrance.

27:04.223 --> 27:05.656
Tom?

27:05.658 --> 27:07.224
He was there five minutes ago.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.326
Tom?

27:09.328 --> 27:10.995
What are you doing here, son?

27:10.997 --> 27:13.797
What happened?
You're bleeding.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.265
They shot the animals, Mum.

27:15.267 --> 27:16.900
What are you talking about,
love?

27:16.902 --> 27:20.137
In the zoo.
They shot loads.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.172
The gunmen will come back
if they bomb again.

27:22.174 --> 27:26.377
Nurse Hall.
You're required on Ward Five.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.179
Stay away from that zoo.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.748
Do you hear me?

27:56.842 --> 27:59.076
What are you doing here again?

27:59.078 --> 28:01.111
What are you doing here again?

28:06.686 --> 28:08.986
Tom. What's wrong?

28:10.156 --> 28:11.989
Did you not hear?

28:11.991 --> 28:15.225
They shot the animals
in the zoo.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.960
Lots of them.

28:16.962 --> 28:19.697
Because of the bombs.

28:19.699 --> 28:21.198
Did they...

28:22.368 --> 28:25.135
shoot Buster?

28:26.172 --> 28:27.971
Not yet.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.077
But if they come back...

28:33.079 --> 28:34.978
Buster will get...

28:37.083 --> 28:39.016
I have to get him out.

28:41.854 --> 28:43.287
Tom.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.390
Could I help?

29:06.912 --> 29:08.946
Sixty-two thousand Empire troops

29:08.948 --> 29:12.182
have now arrived in Greece,
including the British First...

29:30.936 --> 29:32.836
"They went from cage to cage

29:32.838 --> 29:34.905
shooting the big cats.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.107
Jake helped, too.

29:38.043 --> 29:39.810
He shot Gilbert.

29:39.812 --> 29:43.447
They even shot Hugo
the giant rat.

29:43.449 --> 29:47.317
Not the birds, monkeys,
reptiles and some others.

29:48.554 --> 29:51.088
You would've stopped them, Dad.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.123
But I couldn't."

30:10.409 --> 30:12.242
Shh.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.877
It's only me.

30:16.816 --> 30:19.082
I'm sorry about the animals.

30:19.084 --> 30:21.285
Send Dad my letter, Mum.

30:21.287 --> 30:23.153
He needs to know.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.589
I will.

30:27.059 --> 30:29.059
Go to sleep, son.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.381
It's not even budging.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.984
And how we going to get him
past the guard anyway?

30:53.986 --> 30:56.486
That's why we have
to get this gate open.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.155
Charlie doesn't even know
it's here,

30:58.157 --> 31:01.024
so it's the safest way
to get Buster out.

31:04.930 --> 31:07.064
We need to do it
before the weekend.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.899
Last raid was at the weekend,

31:08.901 --> 31:11.235
so I'm thinking Hitler
does weekends,

31:11.237 --> 31:12.636
when everyone's home.

31:12.638 --> 31:14.638
Okay.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.406
How long can we keep him there?

31:16.408 --> 31:18.642
Until my dad gets home.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.913
Until the war is over?
That could be a while, Tom.

31:24.216 --> 31:27.184
What if somebody
finds Buster there?

31:27.186 --> 31:28.919
They won't.

31:28.921 --> 31:30.487
Nobody will ever find my place.

31:30.489 --> 31:33.323
I've been going there for years.

31:33.325 --> 31:35.125
I found it.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.663
Yeah, but me and you are...

31:41.267 --> 31:43.233
a bit different.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.937
Tom, we aren't strong enough.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.405
I will get that gate open.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.907
Tom, we need help.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.277
We can't.

31:53.279 --> 31:54.978
Nobody can know.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.214
I'm not saying adult help.

31:57.216 --> 31:59.416
Patty-cake,
patty-cake, baker's man...

31:59.418 --> 32:01.652
No, no.
Who, Pete?

32:05.291 --> 32:07.291
No chance.
He's a nutcase.

32:07.293 --> 32:08.992
But he's strong, Tom.

32:18.237 --> 32:21.171
You two lovebirds
writing love letters?

32:22.341 --> 32:24.174
Right, come on.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.243
Out to the yard
with the rest of the children.

32:28.347 --> 32:31.114
We are not lovebirds, Tom.

32:35.220 --> 32:38.622
All I'm saying is, unless you've
got a better idea...

32:41.260 --> 32:43.126
I don't trust him.

32:44.396 --> 32:47.297
Buster won't care about
you trusting Pete...

32:47.299 --> 32:49.499
whenever the gunmen come back.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.512
They must be planning
for another raid.

33:02.514 --> 33:05.115
They're checking
everybody's gas masks work.

33:05.117 --> 33:08.285
Right, you two next.
And no messing, Peter.

33:08.287 --> 33:10.420
Yeah, yeah. I promise, I won't.

33:24.370 --> 33:26.670
You okay?

33:26.672 --> 33:28.739
Sweet Jesus,
are there snakes in here too?

33:28.741 --> 33:30.207
Surely this isn't
on the curriculum.

33:30.209 --> 33:31.475
What?
This!

33:31.477 --> 33:33.110
Gassing the pupils.

33:33.112 --> 33:35.312
I mean, gassed
by your own teachers?

33:39.518 --> 33:41.218
Pete, uh,

33:41.220 --> 33:43.587
do you want to help me
with something?

33:43.589 --> 33:46.456
Me and Jane,
we need someone strong.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.792
You and Jane?

33:50.229 --> 33:51.762
Come on, Jane.

33:57.036 --> 33:59.169
Did you ask him, Tom?

34:05.778 --> 34:08.078
Are you helping Tom
with something?

34:08.080 --> 34:10.246
Might be. Why?

34:11.216 --> 34:12.516
Tom's an animal-loving
weirdo!

34:14.253 --> 34:15.685
Do you want me to help, Jane?

34:15.687 --> 34:18.155
That'd be a delight.

34:19.491 --> 34:22.092
Hold on. Did you just say
that I'd be shite?

34:22.094 --> 34:23.659
I'd love you to help, Pete.

34:23.661 --> 34:25.495
Back to your seat, Vernon.

34:29.467 --> 34:30.667
Vernon?

34:35.239 --> 34:36.672
I'm in.

34:44.382 --> 34:46.583
We all have to do it.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.752
Right now.

35:18.383 --> 35:20.450
We have to be sure
we can trust you, Pete.

35:23.555 --> 35:26.256
I swear on my mother, my father,
my Uncle Sammy, my Aunt Lydia,

35:26.258 --> 35:28.325
my... my go-kart,
my Meccano, my...

35:28.327 --> 35:30.393
Hey, look, Pete,
there's an eagle.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.296
You...

35:55.921 --> 35:58.288
What about the streetlamps?

35:59.291 --> 36:00.824
Lamps won't be on.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.659
Curfew.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.795
Tom?
What?

36:05.797 --> 36:07.464
We should wear dark clothes.

36:09.334 --> 36:10.700
No, I don't even
have dark clothes.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.502
Great idea.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.871
Tom?
What, Pete?

36:14.873 --> 36:16.640
We should bring our gas masks.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.776
Tom?
What, Pete?

36:19.778 --> 36:22.779
Will Buster need a gas mask
or something?

36:24.550 --> 36:26.449
Well, he can breathe, can't he?

36:26.451 --> 36:28.752
What if he decides he doesn't
want to come with us?

36:28.754 --> 36:30.887
Have you ever walked
an elephant before?

36:30.889 --> 36:32.422
He will.

36:32.424 --> 36:33.790
I have a special touch.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.860
But I bet he's strong, though.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.195
We're going to need
an adult to help us.

36:38.197 --> 36:40.197
No.
No, Pete.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.765
That's why we have you.

36:43.202 --> 36:44.868
Okay, Tom.

36:50.976 --> 36:53.443
It's just, I thought the real
reason I was recruited was,

36:53.445 --> 36:54.778
well, you know...

36:54.780 --> 36:56.479
Definitely not.

36:57.683 --> 36:59.282
All right, you two.

37:00.385 --> 37:03.253
No chance.
No chance.

37:03.255 --> 37:06.423
<i>♪ He wakes each
morning Bright and early ♪</i>

37:06.425 --> 37:09.826
<i>♪ To wake up
All the neighborhood ♪</i>

37:09.828 --> 37:12.762
<i>♪ To bring to every boy
And girlie ♪</i>

37:12.764 --> 37:16.266
<i>♪ His happy serenade on wood ♪</i>

37:16.268 --> 37:17.968

37:17.970 --> 37:19.970
<i>♪ Peck, peck, pecking

37:19.972 --> 37:23.540
<i>♪ He's as happy as a bumblebee
All day long ♪</i>

37:23.542 --> 37:27.744
It's peck, peck, pecking,
not pick, pick, picking, Pete.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.247
It's the woodpecker song.

37:30.249 --> 37:32.249
I thought it was a wood picker.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.987
Wood... woodpecker.

37:36.989 --> 37:38.588
Woodpecker.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.894
Tonight.
Tonight.

37:50.302 --> 37:52.902
Tonight.

37:53.905 --> 37:55.739
For Buster.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.440
For Buster.
For Buster.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.369
I didn't even hear you, Jane.

38:26.371 --> 38:28.371
You're like a ghost.

38:33.712 --> 38:35.812
I'm sorry I'm late.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.514
I'm not great in the dark.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.784
Oh, yeah.
I had to bring my brother.

38:40.786 --> 38:43.920
He was making too much noise
when I was getting up.

38:43.922 --> 38:46.556
He would have woken my mother,
and she'd have killed me.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.058
It's fine.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.626
Hi.

38:52.397 --> 38:53.930
His name is...

38:55.033 --> 38:58.468
My name is Mickey.

38:58.470 --> 39:03.807
He thinks because I'm like this
that this doesn't work.

39:03.809 --> 39:05.875
Hi, Mickey.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.011
I didn't even know
that you had a...

39:08.013 --> 39:10.380
He didn't tell you?
You told me not to, Pete.

39:10.382 --> 39:11.915
And I keep my word.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.486
I don't really talk
about Mickey.

39:16.488 --> 39:19.522
People laugh at him
just because he's different.

39:19.524 --> 39:20.957
Tell me a kid
that isn't different.

39:20.959 --> 39:23.860
I'd say he's more
different than me.

39:23.862 --> 39:27.130
Don't worry. We'll be much
faster when he's on my back.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.732
He likes to wander off.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.400
Jane!
Come on, you two.

39:30.402 --> 39:32.469
Do what?
Stop.

39:35.974 --> 39:37.674
What are you two doing out here?

39:37.676 --> 39:39.976
What are you doing out here?

39:39.978 --> 39:41.778
Sorry, misters.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.913
He just got out of the house.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.548
He's not all there.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.884
Well, get him back in.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.486
Get back in.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.087
Now.
Now.

39:51.089 --> 39:53.156
And is that your dog barking?

39:53.158 --> 39:54.824
And why is your dog barking?

39:54.826 --> 39:56.393
Sorry.

39:56.395 --> 39:57.494
Well, shut it up, too.

39:57.496 --> 39:59.028
Shut it up.

40:01.099 --> 40:03.967
Rover, shut your piehole.

40:05.537 --> 40:07.137
Get out of my yard!

40:10.876 --> 40:12.509
Are you okay, Jane?

40:12.511 --> 40:14.144
Did he hit you?

40:14.146 --> 40:16.179
Didn't even feel it.

40:17.783 --> 40:18.982
Now, come on.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.583
We've got to help Buster.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.771
Pete.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.160
Shit a dog.

41:04.162 --> 41:06.129
That's a real elephant in there.

41:06.131 --> 41:07.630
That's Buster.

41:07.632 --> 41:09.199
He's so perfect.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.836
Much bigger than I expected.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.572
He's an elephant, Pete.

41:15.574 --> 41:18.074
An elephant.

41:20.245 --> 41:22.979
Jane, grab those keys
and run around

41:22.981 --> 41:24.714
and open the double doors.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.689
Tom, throw me your dad's keys.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.695
Shh, Buster.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.743
Wrap that around your wrist
and hold on tight,

41:53.745 --> 41:55.178
but don't yank it.

41:58.049 --> 41:59.282
You two coming or what?

41:59.284 --> 42:01.184
Lead the way, lady.

42:06.791 --> 42:08.758
I'm walking an elephant!

42:08.760 --> 42:10.593
Would you shut it, Pete?

42:51.636 --> 42:53.937
Oh, my God.

42:53.939 --> 42:55.605
Is that for us?

42:55.607 --> 42:57.840
That's for us?

42:57.842 --> 42:59.242
We are kill't.

42:59.244 --> 43:01.210
Run, run.

43:01.212 --> 43:02.845
Wait.

43:02.847 --> 43:04.280
Mickey. Where's Mickey?

43:04.282 --> 43:06.215
I need to pee.

43:07.185 --> 43:08.918
He won't budge until he goes.

43:12.324 --> 43:13.790
Hello?

43:13.792 --> 43:15.725
Hello?

43:15.727 --> 43:18.161
Yes, this is security
up at the zoo.

43:18.163 --> 43:19.829
Yeah.

43:19.831 --> 43:21.164
Well...

43:22.601 --> 43:24.767
whatever's happening, it's...

43:25.971 --> 43:28.104
well, it's happening.

43:36.281 --> 43:38.848
Come on, Mickey, please.

43:38.850 --> 43:41.384
Wait. Wait. Wait.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.087
That's me.

43:45.724 --> 43:47.757
Hurry, quick, come on.

43:56.167 --> 43:59.268
That's really sweet, Pete, the way
you care for your brother like that.

43:59.270 --> 44:01.237
Is it?

44:18.790 --> 44:21.190
Pete, the gate. Quietly.

44:29.200 --> 44:32.368
Stop. Pete...

44:32.370 --> 44:34.070
where are my dad's keys?

44:35.006 --> 44:36.105
I left them in the pen.

44:39.444 --> 44:40.943
I'll go get them.

44:40.945 --> 44:42.178
Yeah, good.

44:42.180 --> 44:43.446
I mean, no.

44:43.448 --> 44:44.981
Jane, you'll get caught.

44:44.983 --> 44:46.215
The zoo will be swarming.

44:46.217 --> 44:48.051
You boys steer him to the tree.

44:48.053 --> 44:49.852
I'll go get the keys.

44:49.854 --> 44:51.254
Jane...

44:51.256 --> 44:52.989
Tom, I want to do this.

44:52.991 --> 44:55.158
Stand very still.

44:56.261 --> 44:58.795
Well, well, well.

44:58.797 --> 45:00.163
Well, well.

45:02.300 --> 45:04.000
Yes.

45:04.002 --> 45:06.035
I see what's going on here.

45:10.075 --> 45:12.208
And you're going to need these.

45:20.251 --> 45:22.919
Off you go, Buster.

45:30.962 --> 45:32.829
Come on, quick.
We'd better go.

46:05.830 --> 46:08.865
Buster, this way.

46:14.472 --> 46:16.072
Amen.

46:43.334 --> 46:45.034
We did it.

46:45.036 --> 46:46.269
We did it.

46:46.271 --> 46:48.004
Pete!

46:48.006 --> 46:49.539
Where's Mickey?

46:49.541 --> 46:51.474
Mickey?
Mickey?

46:59.150 --> 47:00.983
Stay in your houses.

47:00.985 --> 47:02.485
Stay inside.

47:02.487 --> 47:04.887
Inside!

47:04.889 --> 47:08.191
Trying to make
yourselves a target here.

47:08.193 --> 47:10.359
Stay in your houses.

47:47.398 --> 47:49.632
Is there somebody in there?

47:51.202 --> 47:53.402
I'm going to be awhile, Mister.

47:58.443 --> 47:59.976
It's a two-flusher.

48:01.946 --> 48:03.512
Right, well...

48:03.514 --> 48:05.348
carry on, then.

48:07.151 --> 48:09.352
He was with us
at Floral Gardens.

48:09.354 --> 48:10.920
I better go find him.

48:10.922 --> 48:12.588
You want me to come with you?

48:12.590 --> 48:15.424
I need to get in before my dad.

48:15.426 --> 48:17.093
Are you okay with Buster?

48:17.095 --> 48:18.327
Yeah.

48:18.329 --> 48:19.929
See you at school.

48:21.332 --> 48:24.033
Jane. Thanks.

48:25.069 --> 48:26.369
No.

48:26.371 --> 48:28.104
Thank you, Tom.

48:29.007 --> 48:30.473
Hey, Tom?

48:30.475 --> 48:32.141
We all stole
an elephant tonight.

48:32.143 --> 48:33.342
Shh! "Saved."

48:33.344 --> 48:35.244
Saved.

48:40.184 --> 48:41.918
Mickey.

48:41.920 --> 48:44.186
Mickey.
Mickey!

48:44.188 --> 48:45.988
Shh, Pete.

48:45.990 --> 48:48.057
We're going to have to split up.

48:48.059 --> 48:50.459
You go that way.
I'm going to go this way.

48:51.396 --> 48:52.628
I'm not good with the dark.

48:52.630 --> 48:54.230
Pete!

48:57.068 --> 48:58.701
Mickey.

49:03.241 --> 49:05.141
Now then, young man.

49:05.143 --> 49:07.576
You're going to tell me what
you're doing out after curfew.

49:07.578 --> 49:09.145
Do you hear me?

49:09.147 --> 49:11.147
Where to begin, Mister?

49:12.450 --> 49:15.651
Well, it's been quite a night.

49:17.722 --> 49:20.389
Didn't we meet earlier tonight?

49:20.391 --> 49:23.292
That's neither here nor there.

49:26.297 --> 49:29.098
See you tomorrow, Buster.

49:31.469 --> 49:33.736
What was that?

49:33.738 --> 49:35.338
Did you hear that?

49:37.709 --> 49:40.276
Strange sound...
Shh!

49:40.278 --> 49:42.244
You're hearing things now?

49:43.314 --> 49:45.047
Why so damn tight, Pete?

49:45.049 --> 49:46.315
Oh, there it is again.

49:46.317 --> 49:48.017
Come on.

49:56.194 --> 49:57.727
Mrs. Austin.

49:57.729 --> 49:59.395
It's me, Tom.

49:59.397 --> 50:01.197
Tom Hall?

50:05.403 --> 50:08.738
Holy sweet Jesus
and the apostles.

50:09.774 --> 50:11.173
It's okay. He's really tame.

50:11.175 --> 50:13.142
That's a bloody elephant.

50:13.144 --> 50:14.510
I need help.

50:14.512 --> 50:16.178
You got your own home,
haven't you?

50:16.180 --> 50:18.014
I can't take him home.

50:18.016 --> 50:20.016
My dad works at the zoo.
He'd be sacked.

50:20.018 --> 50:23.185
Well, you can't keep him here.
You're not my responsibility.

50:23.187 --> 50:24.754
You like animals.

50:24.756 --> 50:27.056
I had nowhere else to go.

50:27.058 --> 50:30.760
Please, just, until my dad
gets back from war.

50:32.296 --> 50:35.164
Let me and Buster in
and I'll explain.

50:37.502 --> 50:39.135
Please.

50:47.311 --> 50:50.646
Will you stop that damn noise!

50:50.648 --> 50:53.382
It's the middle of the night,
for God's sake!

50:55.153 --> 50:56.786
She's as blind as a cat.

51:47.238 --> 51:48.537
Jane!

51:48.539 --> 51:50.739
You better get in this house!

51:53.544 --> 51:54.844
Jane!

51:54.846 --> 51:56.812
Where are you?

52:21.672 --> 52:24.707
How can you let a two-ton
elephant simply vanish, Charlie?

52:24.709 --> 52:28.210
Animals do not vanish
from my zoo.

52:28.212 --> 52:31.580
The public must be informed.

52:42.326 --> 52:44.293
Did you sleep well?

52:44.295 --> 52:46.195
You seem tired.

52:46.197 --> 52:48.597
Where were you last night, son?

52:48.599 --> 52:50.499
Just out.

52:50.501 --> 52:52.868
Did you get the dinner
I left out for you?

52:53.804 --> 52:54.803
Bye!

52:56.607 --> 52:58.274
Mum, did Dad...

53:02.580 --> 53:04.246
Reply yet?

53:06.217 --> 53:07.716
We never found Mickey.

53:07.718 --> 53:09.485
We looked everywhere.

53:12.323 --> 53:13.923
Where's Pete now?

53:13.925 --> 53:15.791
Don't know.

53:16.727 --> 53:18.394
Probably still looking.

53:20.631 --> 53:23.832
Jane, there was a slight
change of plan last night.

53:23.834 --> 53:26.402
Quick.

53:26.404 --> 53:27.603
We are so dead.

53:28.773 --> 53:31.207
We are so dead.

53:31.209 --> 53:32.675
What's he saying?

53:34.312 --> 53:35.844
He's telling them about Buster.

53:35.846 --> 53:37.580
Oh, we're so dead.

53:37.582 --> 53:39.582
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

53:47.325 --> 53:49.858
Peter, Mickey is not allowed
to play with the swans

53:49.860 --> 53:51.293
in the lagoon anymore.

53:51.295 --> 53:53.229
I'm sorry, Mother.
It was...

53:53.231 --> 53:55.431
Wait. Swans?

53:55.433 --> 53:57.233
Yeah, Pete.

53:57.235 --> 53:58.701
The swans.

54:09.280 --> 54:11.580
What's she doing?

54:20.491 --> 54:22.558
You don't actually trust her,
do you?

54:25.529 --> 54:26.996
Tom.

54:35.940 --> 54:38.307
Lock the door after me, Tom.

54:48.919 --> 54:50.519
It's a trap.

54:50.521 --> 54:53.756
I know it is.

54:59.563 --> 55:01.530
Now you know how to get in.

55:05.503 --> 55:07.036
We need her.

55:14.779 --> 55:16.645
Denise.

55:18.582 --> 55:20.983
Now we're all in this together.

55:24.355 --> 55:26.555
Oh!

55:32.430 --> 55:36.732
I seem to have...

55:38.369 --> 55:40.803
made some...

55:42.340 --> 55:45.474
little friends.

55:54.552 --> 55:58.787
And a large one.

56:10.034 --> 56:12.368
We'll need a lot more straw.

56:16.040 --> 56:18.941
Oh, just leave it in there.

56:21.679 --> 56:22.644
May I?

56:23.681 --> 56:24.646
Yes.

56:53.144 --> 56:55.844
Would you like me...

56:56.747 --> 56:58.514
to do your hair?

57:00.584 --> 57:02.651
It's all right if not.

57:06.824 --> 57:09.792
You have beautiful hair.

57:16.100 --> 57:19.468
Ever been to the zoo,
Mrs. Austin?

57:22.473 --> 57:25.441
It's okay.
I've only been once, with Tom.

57:27.745 --> 57:31.580
It's just, with these knees...

57:32.783 --> 57:34.683
and that hill.

57:39.924 --> 57:41.824
You look nice.
Thanks.

57:41.826 --> 57:44.493
You want me to do yours?
No, no, no.

57:44.495 --> 57:46.628
Thank you, love.

57:47.865 --> 57:50.098
If you ever need
your hair brushed again...

57:51.769 --> 57:54.736
or anything else...

57:54.738 --> 57:57.739
don't you hesitate
from coming down here.

58:00.778 --> 58:02.744
We girls.

58:10.020 --> 58:11.987
You okay, Buster?

58:13.891 --> 58:15.991
What is wrong?

58:15.993 --> 58:18.894
Are you feeling okay, Buster?

58:18.896 --> 58:22.197
It's all right. It's okay.
It's okay, Buster.

58:22.199 --> 58:23.265
It's okay.

58:23.267 --> 58:25.000
Good boy.

59:35.973 --> 59:37.606
I thought you were at work.

59:38.842 --> 59:40.275
From your dad.

59:40.277 --> 59:42.010
Yours is on the other side.

59:50.354 --> 59:51.920
Is this all he sent?

59:51.922 --> 59:54.089
I think he did well.

59:54.091 --> 59:55.624
He's not the writing type.

59:55.626 --> 59:57.326
He said nothing about the zoo.

59:58.762 --> 01:00:01.096
Well, maybe he hasn't
got your letter yet.

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:04.833
Anyway, you should be happy
to hear from your father.

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:06.602
No, Mum.

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:09.605
Maybe you only care
about people.

01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:12.274
But I care about animals, too.

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:14.643
Of course I care.

01:00:14.645 --> 01:00:16.178
I have to work.

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.713
I've no choice, son.

01:00:17.715 --> 01:00:19.781
People really need nurses
at the minute.

01:00:22.853 --> 01:00:24.386
I'm sorry.

01:00:26.256 --> 01:00:27.990
Don't be sorry.

01:00:29.026 --> 01:00:30.959
This isn't your fault.

01:00:32.096 --> 01:00:33.829
This is war, son.

01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:36.632
I'm sorry.

01:00:36.634 --> 01:00:39.301
I'm sorry for this whole mess.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.741
You are not responsible
for that zoo.

01:00:45.743 --> 01:00:48.176
Your father wouldn't want that.

01:01:26.216 --> 01:01:28.150
Buster, you need to eat.

01:01:29.687 --> 01:01:31.887
Eat, Buster, please.

01:01:31.889 --> 01:01:34.823
Buster, you're going to get sick
if you don't eat.

01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:05.487
See if he'll eat these.

01:02:20.037 --> 01:02:23.271
There have been multiple
calls to date from your neighbors,

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:25.073
all saying there's
strange noises

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:27.042
coming from your backyard.

01:02:27.044 --> 01:02:29.277
Strange noises
coming from your backyard.

01:02:29.279 --> 01:02:31.379
They're bloody animals.
They're going to make a noise.

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:34.249
We have orders, missus.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:36.818
We're looking for an elephant.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.086
May we come in?

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:40.155
No, you can't.

01:02:40.157 --> 01:02:43.258
This here is the
veterinarian from the zoo.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.995
I don't care where he comes
from, you're not coming in.

01:02:46.997 --> 01:02:49.197
Oh! Oh, how dare you?

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:52.234
How dare you force yourselves
into my property?

01:02:52.236 --> 01:02:53.401
This is disgraceful.

01:02:53.403 --> 01:02:54.870
I'm sorry, ma'am.

01:02:54.872 --> 01:02:56.438
I'm Jake McClune.

01:02:59.176 --> 01:03:01.510
This is a disgrace!

01:03:03.881 --> 01:03:06.214
Bertie, look at that.

01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:11.987
Hey.

01:03:18.195 --> 01:03:20.061
It's like a zoo in here.

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:21.997
Like a zoo.

01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:26.067
So sorry, Tom.

01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:52.594
Well, don't you
need a license for all these?

01:03:52.596 --> 01:03:56.064
She needs a license...
or something.

01:03:56.066 --> 01:03:59.100
No. They're all just
household pets.

01:04:10.881 --> 01:04:14.282
So, what'll happen
to this elephant,

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.318
if found?

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:22.224
If they find that elephant,
they'll destroy it.

01:04:32.302 --> 01:04:35.637
So much for your new
elephant keeper job, Hall.

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:38.306
A reward for its capture, too.

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:40.141
There's an elephant
out there, Hall.

01:04:40.143 --> 01:04:42.177
And we are going to find it.

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:47.616
A big fat reward.
We'll be rich.

01:04:50.153 --> 01:04:52.621
Pete won't help Vernon
to find him.

01:04:52.623 --> 01:04:55.090
It's not Vernon
I'm worried about.

01:04:55.092 --> 01:04:57.459
Everybody will be
looking for Buster.

01:05:00.998 --> 01:05:03.265
"Having been forced
to admit the disappearance

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:06.501
of the elephant,
a red-faced Mr. Shawcross,

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:10.505
zoo manager, has offered
a substantial reward

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:12.474
for any information

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:14.209
leading to the recovery
of the elephant."

01:05:15.145 --> 01:05:17.178
We're going to be so famous.

01:05:20.117 --> 01:05:24.152
"Of grave concern is the fact
that Buster suffers from

01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:26.254
elephant degenerative disease

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:29.357
due to maltreatment
in his previous location.

01:05:30.994 --> 01:05:33.595
If not treated,
the condition can be fatal.

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:35.597
The public are warned
not to approach the elephant,

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:38.033
but to immediately inform
the police."

01:05:40.037 --> 01:05:42.337
Poor thing.

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:49.411
One a day keeps the doc away.

01:05:50.414 --> 01:05:52.013
The medicine.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:56.351
Jake was giving it to
him from the cupboard.

01:05:56.353 --> 01:05:57.953
We have to go back in.

01:05:57.955 --> 01:05:59.387
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:05:59.389 --> 01:06:01.423
There's no way
we're going back in there.

01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:03.458
My nerves just couldn't
take that again.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.962
If I could take
your place, Pete, I would.

01:06:06.964 --> 01:06:08.463
We go in tonight.

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:10.165
Maybe I should go in alone.

01:06:11.168 --> 01:06:12.267
They'll be on high alert.

01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:14.703
Not a chance.

01:06:14.705 --> 01:06:17.138
Buster's ill, and we're a team.

01:06:34.758 --> 01:06:37.292
There's always
hard times, Buster.

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:40.095
But you'll get through it.

01:06:41.198 --> 01:06:44.632
No matter how hard things get,

01:06:44.634 --> 01:06:47.035
the birds always sing
in the morning.

01:06:48.138 --> 01:06:50.305
I always tell myself that.

01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:06.554
Not tonight.

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:39.120
Dad?

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:04.446
Are you all right?

01:08:13.824 --> 01:08:15.723
Jane. Run, Jane. Come on.

01:08:15.725 --> 01:08:17.859
We have to get
Buster's medicine.

01:08:17.861 --> 01:08:19.527
Not tonight.
It's too dangerous.

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:22.596
Tom, come on!
Run, love! Run!

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:14.749
There, there, Buster.
I'm here.

01:09:29.432 --> 01:09:32.233
Jane!

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:33.734
Sorry. Are you okay?

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:36.504
I knew you'd come, Tom.

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:39.407
They've changed the padlocks.

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:41.176
There's a window.

01:10:22.786 --> 01:10:24.919
Got it.

01:11:21.478 --> 01:11:22.877
Jane, let's get to the shelter.

01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:25.580
I need to check my dad's safe.

01:11:25.582 --> 01:11:28.316
But I'll see you at school, Tom.

01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:00.415
Ah!

01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:04.652
This way, Buster. Come on.

01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:54.469
Buster!

01:12:57.707 --> 01:12:58.806
My knees.

01:12:58.808 --> 01:13:00.875
Are you okay, Mrs. Austin?

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:04.379
We got the medicine.
What?

01:13:06.116 --> 01:13:07.615
When?

01:13:07.617 --> 01:13:09.650
Last night.
Me and Jane.

01:13:09.652 --> 01:13:11.085
We got the medicine.

01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:23.564
That's it.

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:25.133
Good boy.

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:52.827
Jane?

01:14:28.565 --> 01:14:30.064
Have you seen Jane?

01:14:30.066 --> 01:14:31.732
No.

01:14:31.734 --> 01:14:33.234
Did you see the bombing
last night?

01:14:33.236 --> 01:14:35.870
Pete, me and Jane,

01:14:35.872 --> 01:14:38.005
we got the medicine.

01:14:38.007 --> 01:14:39.974
What? Last night?

01:14:40.944 --> 01:14:43.578
Just... just you and Jane?

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:47.215
Tom... Tom, why didn't
you ask me?

01:14:47.217 --> 01:14:48.749
Tom?

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:50.685
Can you come here, please?

01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:53.221
Peter, take a seat, please.

01:15:21.584 --> 01:15:25.019
We pray for the men and women
who helped the injured.

01:15:26.055 --> 01:15:27.922
And we pray
for the brave firemen

01:15:27.924 --> 01:15:30.625
from all over Ireland
who came to help us.

01:15:45.675 --> 01:15:50.778
Our very brave
little friend Jane Berry

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:54.715
died last night in the bombings.

01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:58.152
She was only

01:15:58.154 --> 01:16:01.856
a few yards from home.

01:16:03.293 --> 01:16:07.161
Maybe now...

01:16:10.166 --> 01:16:13.301
the troubled little soul...

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:17.905
will have...

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:20.107
peace.

01:17:04.087 --> 01:17:05.853
She adored her dad.

01:17:11.661 --> 01:17:13.861
It's not your fault, son.

01:17:16.265 --> 01:17:19.367
Jane never had a real family...

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:22.870
like you have.

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:29.176
You gave her some fun
in her little life.

01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:31.078
That's what you did.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.814
You made her part of something,

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:35.916
something very special.

01:17:35.918 --> 01:17:38.319
You also made me a part
of something very special,

01:17:38.321 --> 01:17:40.755
something I'll never forget.

01:17:41.724 --> 01:17:42.890
Tom...

01:17:44.093 --> 01:17:46.260
it's not your fault.

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:33.274
Some malt and jam.

01:18:33.276 --> 01:18:35.042
Your favorite.

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:02.737
He's perking up.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:04.505
Pete.

01:19:05.975 --> 01:19:07.241
He blames me for Jane.

01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:09.810
Tom?

01:19:10.847 --> 01:19:13.214
You have a job to finish.

01:19:13.216 --> 01:19:16.784
A job you bravely started.

01:19:16.786 --> 01:19:19.353
She was the only brave one.

01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:21.055
Too many terrible things
have happened,

01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:23.457
and too many people
have been hurt.

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:26.861
You and us have to make sure
that not a single hair

01:19:26.863 --> 01:19:29.930
on Buster's back is harmed.

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:34.301
We have to finish this.

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:37.905
For Jane.
That's right.

01:19:44.847 --> 01:19:46.180
Who's that?

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.151
I'm sorry.

01:19:50.153 --> 01:19:51.418
I didn't mean to.

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:53.154
No.

01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:02.997
It's just a letter.

01:20:02.999 --> 01:20:04.799
A letter from my son.

01:20:05.434 --> 01:20:06.934
You've got a son?

01:20:06.936 --> 01:20:09.036
Had a son.
He was a brave soldier

01:20:09.038 --> 01:20:11.038
in the Great War.

01:20:12.375 --> 01:20:16.043
This is the last photograph
I have of him.

01:20:16.045 --> 01:20:18.345
And the last letter from him.

01:20:18.347 --> 01:20:21.916
He used to write me every week.

01:20:21.918 --> 01:20:25.019
He used to write on everything
he could lay his hands on.

01:20:26.022 --> 01:20:29.156
This one... this one here,

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:31.592
it's written on
a Gitanes packet.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:35.830
Did you write back to him?

01:20:35.832 --> 01:20:37.298
Of course.

01:20:40.469 --> 01:20:42.169
Still do.

01:20:44.907 --> 01:20:47.341
I post him a letter every week.

01:20:49.412 --> 01:20:51.278
How did your son...?

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.048
A bomb hit their camp
in Belgium.

01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:56.150
I'm sorry.

01:20:56.152 --> 01:20:57.518
There's not a day goes by

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.253
when I don't
have a think about him.

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:03.123
But I'm all right.

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:05.626
I've got my animals
to keep me company now.

01:21:07.930 --> 01:21:09.530
The strange thing...

01:21:10.867 --> 01:21:14.335
I always picture him
at your age.

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:18.038
Very like him in many ways, Tom.

01:21:22.445 --> 01:21:24.044
Oh!

01:21:28.918 --> 01:21:30.351
Hello, Pete.

01:21:31.988 --> 01:21:33.954
He's looking better.

01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:55.542
What?

01:21:55.544 --> 01:21:57.111
You tell me what.

01:21:57.113 --> 01:21:58.379
Where were you?

01:21:58.381 --> 01:21:59.947
I was just walking about,
you know.

01:21:59.949 --> 01:22:01.282
Looking for something bad to do.

01:22:01.284 --> 01:22:03.150
Yeah, well,
I was looking for you.

01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:06.520
Hey!

01:22:06.522 --> 01:22:08.322
I said I was looking for you.

01:22:08.324 --> 01:22:10.124
Yeah, well, you found me.

01:22:16.666 --> 01:22:18.699
There you go, Buster.

01:22:18.701 --> 01:22:21.335
Good boy. Good boy.

01:22:21.337 --> 01:22:23.570
He ate a whole cart full.

01:22:52.101 --> 01:22:53.500
Bingo.

01:23:21.297 --> 01:23:24.231
I went back to the tree
the other day with Mickey,

01:23:24.233 --> 01:23:28.168
and repainted our three initials
and added Mickey's.

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:30.004
I hope that's okay
with you, Tom.

01:23:31.307 --> 01:23:32.573
Of course it's okay, Pete.

01:23:32.575 --> 01:23:34.041
Did you repaint it
with your blood?

01:23:34.043 --> 01:23:35.409
Are you kidding?

01:23:35.411 --> 01:23:36.710
No.

01:23:36.712 --> 01:23:38.379
Painted it with my Meccano pen.

01:23:40.383 --> 01:23:41.682
Come on, you two.

01:23:41.684 --> 01:23:43.751
Tom?
Yeah, Pete?

01:23:43.753 --> 01:23:46.086
I never want those initials to fade.
Neither do I.

01:23:51.127 --> 01:23:53.360
How was that?
You all right?

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:55.362
I saw the elephant, Hall.

01:23:56.432 --> 01:23:58.532
That's right. I saw it.

01:23:58.534 --> 01:24:00.434
And you know what?

01:24:00.436 --> 01:24:03.103
Not only am I going to get
a fat reward and get famous,

01:24:03.105 --> 01:24:05.139
but you're dead
when the police find out

01:24:05.141 --> 01:24:06.807
you were involved, Hall.

01:24:06.809 --> 01:24:08.776
And your dad'll be sacked!

01:24:11.347 --> 01:24:13.247
Pete, why are you
speaking to him?

01:24:13.249 --> 01:24:16.650
What are you? Deaf and dumb
like your dopey brother?

01:24:17.586 --> 01:24:18.786
Pete...

01:24:18.788 --> 01:24:20.687
Petey? I didn't mean...

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:27.661
Never, ever speak
about my brother again.

01:24:27.663 --> 01:24:29.163
Come here, you.

01:24:33.769 --> 01:24:36.470
Pete! Pete! Pete! Pete! Pete!

01:24:41.544 --> 01:24:44.211
I found the elephant!

01:24:44.213 --> 01:24:45.479
Hello? Misters?

01:24:45.481 --> 01:24:47.681
I found the elephant!

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.366
You okay?

01:25:10.539 --> 01:25:12.506
Could you reach me that?

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:26.253
One a day keeps the doc away.

01:25:29.258 --> 01:25:31.758
I guess now you know
why I never made it to war.

01:25:45.774 --> 01:25:47.341
I...

01:25:48.711 --> 01:25:50.477
I need to talk.

01:26:09.365 --> 01:26:11.198
Hopefully...

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.500
hopefully these will
help him get...

01:26:14.603 --> 01:26:16.236
Hello again, ma'am.

01:26:16.238 --> 01:26:17.671
It's okay.

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:19.540
He's part of our team now.

01:26:19.542 --> 01:26:21.542
Let's finish what we started.

01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:29.283
Tom?

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:32.786
What?

01:26:32.788 --> 01:26:35.255
Look.

01:26:35.257 --> 01:26:37.658
Shortly after the last devastating raid,

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:40.928
the Allied forces took control
of the skies.

01:26:40.930 --> 01:26:44.364
It was then we knew
our job was done.

01:28:05.714 --> 01:28:07.347
Hello.

01:28:07.349 --> 01:28:09.049
"Awsofer," I need
to report something.

01:28:09.051 --> 01:28:10.517
Shh.

01:28:10.519 --> 01:28:11.918
Repeat that?

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:13.720
It's the zoo vet here.

01:28:13.722 --> 01:28:15.756
The elephant has returned.
The what has returned?

01:28:15.758 --> 01:28:17.691
Buster. The
missing elephant?

01:28:17.693 --> 01:28:19.493
How?
Don't know.

01:28:19.495 --> 01:28:20.694
What?

01:28:20.696 --> 01:28:21.928
It's a mystery.

01:28:21.930 --> 01:28:23.530
It just returned?

01:28:23.532 --> 01:28:24.631
Yes, officer.

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:25.999
Buster's here now.

01:28:26.001 --> 01:28:27.768
You can call off the search...

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:34.775
You will not believe
what has just reappeared.

01:28:34.777 --> 01:28:36.977
I need to talk to somebody

01:28:36.979 --> 01:28:39.079
about the missing elephant.

01:28:39.081 --> 01:28:41.048
That missing elephant is...

01:28:41.050 --> 01:28:43.383
no longer missing.

01:28:45.721 --> 01:28:47.421
Okay.

01:28:47.423 --> 01:28:48.488
It's in my dresser drawer.

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:51.858
The green leather one.

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:53.493
Shortly after we returned Buster,

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:55.929
I discovered my letters to Dad.

01:28:55.931 --> 01:28:57.931
Unsent.

01:28:59.568 --> 01:29:01.068
Did you find it, Tom?

01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:03.437
The little gray one.

01:29:05.407 --> 01:29:07.974
I decided my mum's secret

01:29:07.976 --> 01:29:11.945
should be kept a secret.

01:29:11.947 --> 01:29:15.449
And I grew to understand
why she never sent the letters.

01:29:26.595 --> 01:29:29.496
She's heavy.

01:29:29.498 --> 01:29:32.733
Whose idea was this anyway?

01:29:32.735 --> 01:29:34.134
I heard that.

01:29:34.136 --> 01:29:37.804
I'm sorry, boys,
but I like my Paris buns.

01:29:37.806 --> 01:29:39.539
Sometime later,

01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:42.542
Charlie was reinstated
to his rightful place.

01:29:46.648 --> 01:29:48.682
You're going to have
to pay, just like everyone else.

01:29:48.684 --> 01:29:51.752
And he quickly
returned to his old self.

01:29:51.754 --> 01:29:53.820
No problem, Charlie.

01:29:53.822 --> 01:29:54.888
It's Mister to you.

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:57.624
Oh, grow up, Mister.

01:30:08.771 --> 01:30:11.071
Have a wonderful afternoon.

01:30:13.509 --> 01:30:15.776
Oh, look, boys.

01:30:15.778 --> 01:30:17.911
Flamingos.

01:30:17.913 --> 01:30:19.613
I know.
I know.

01:30:23.152 --> 01:30:26.119
Oh, look, a giraffe!

01:30:26.121 --> 01:30:28.889
We know.

01:30:48.844 --> 01:30:50.911
Oh, Lord.

01:30:51.914 --> 01:30:54.147
There's my little boy.

01:30:55.984 --> 01:30:58.552
He has grown.

01:31:03.492 --> 01:31:06.626
There were two major
bombing raids on Belfast.

01:31:06.628 --> 01:31:10.096
Over a thousand souls
lost their lives.

01:31:13.135 --> 01:31:14.835
A while later,

01:31:14.837 --> 01:31:17.604
Dad returned safely
from the war.

01:31:24.713 --> 01:31:26.646
Pete, against all odds,

01:31:26.648 --> 01:31:28.982
went on to become
a doctor in London,

01:31:28.984 --> 01:31:31.952
specializing in children
with disabilities.

01:31:31.954 --> 01:31:33.687
We write to each other often.

01:31:33.689 --> 01:31:37.090
And he tells me Mickey
is as bossy as ever.

01:31:40.062 --> 01:31:45.265
Mrs. Austin died
peacefully in her sleep in 1962,

01:31:45.267 --> 01:31:49.035
finally and eternally
reunited with her beloved son.

01:31:56.278 --> 01:32:00.013
I visit Jane's grave
every year on her birthday

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:04.117
and retell her the story
of how we saved an elephant.

01:32:08.290 --> 01:32:10.090
Well done, son.

01:32:12.628 --> 01:32:14.194
I'm proud of you.

01:32:15.230 --> 01:32:17.230
Dad is going strong.

01:32:17.232 --> 01:32:20.133
Still working up at the zoo.

01:32:20.135 --> 01:32:23.003
And still my hero.

01:32:25.307 --> 01:32:27.007
Me?

01:32:27.009 --> 01:32:29.609
There was only one place
in the whole world

01:32:29.611 --> 01:32:31.244
I wanted to work.

01:32:32.305 --> 01:32:38.167
