00:23.957 --> 00:26.687
Are you sure this rice
isn't supposed to be cooked?

00:26.760 --> 00:28.193
Steamed, fried?

00:28.261 --> 00:30.786
The idea is to shower
the couple with a symbol

00:30.864 --> 00:34.300
of good fortune, not garnish
them like a roast chicken.

00:35.735 --> 00:36.963
Smile.

00:40.407 --> 00:41.965
Rice, anyone?

00:42.075 --> 00:43.508
l'll take one.

00:48.748 --> 00:50.340
Red Alert.

00:50.417 --> 00:51.714
Ready?

01:01.194 --> 01:02.320
This is it, Tom.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.363
Your bachelor days are over.

01:04.431 --> 01:05.898
Not a moment too soon.

01:05.965 --> 01:07.899
Second thoughts?

01:08.001 --> 01:10.868
Second, third, fourth...

01:17.577 --> 01:19.807
l never thought l'd see the day.

01:19.879 --> 01:21.779
Given the volatile nature

01:21.848 --> 01:23.839
of their relationship,
one might have

01:23.917 --> 01:26.181
predicted homicide
rather than matrimony.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.948
When it comes to affairs
of the human heart,

01:29.089 --> 01:31.250
it is wise to look beyond logic.

01:33.693 --> 01:35.684
We're gathered here today

01:35.762 --> 01:39.960
not as Starfleet officers,
but as friends and family

01:40.033 --> 01:44.527
to celebrate the marriage
of two of Voyager's finest.

01:44.637 --> 01:49.574
B'Elanna has asked me to forego
the rigors of Klingon painstiks

01:49.642 --> 01:52.338
in favor of a more
traditional ceremony.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.403
They're saving the painstiks
for the honeymoon.

01:55.748 --> 01:57.375
As Captain,

01:57.450 --> 02:00.817
the honor of joining these
two people has fallen to me,

02:00.887 --> 02:03.412
but before l declare them
husband and wife,

02:03.490 --> 02:06.357
Tom and B'Elanna
have prepared their own vows.

02:12.031 --> 02:15.626
l still don't know what
l've done to deserve you...

02:18.037 --> 02:21.939
but whatever it is,
l'll try to keep doing it,

02:22.075 --> 02:25.511
and l promise to stand by you,

02:25.578 --> 02:28.479
to honor you...

02:28.548 --> 02:30.948
till death do us part.

02:31.017 --> 02:33.281
Ensign.

02:33.353 --> 02:34.513
Hmm?

02:34.587 --> 02:35.554
The ring.

02:35.622 --> 02:36.680
Oh.

02:42.228 --> 02:46.426
May this ring be a symbol
of our eternal love.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.263
You stood by me...

02:52.038 --> 02:55.337
when most people would have
run for the nearest airlock.

02:55.408 --> 03:01.142
You were willing to see past
my shortcomings...

03:01.214 --> 03:03.808
and to take
all the bumps and bruises

03:03.883 --> 03:05.544
that came along with it.

03:07.287 --> 03:10.450
You made me a better person...

03:10.523 --> 03:13.083
even though l put up
one hell of a fight.

03:15.094 --> 03:18.222
l look forward
to our journey together.

03:19.666 --> 03:21.429
Commander.

03:27.340 --> 03:32.642
May this ring be the symbol
of our eternal love.

03:35.081 --> 03:36.480
Not so fast.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.609
Lieutenant
Thomas Eugene Paris...

03:39.686 --> 03:42.621
Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres,

03:42.689 --> 03:45.624
with the power vested in me
by Starfleet Command

03:45.692 --> 03:48.286
and the United
Federation of Planets,

03:48.361 --> 03:52.855
l now pronounce you
husband and wife.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.626
Now, Tom.

04:01.708 --> 04:02.675
Bravo.

04:13.953 --> 04:16.319
Congratulations.

04:16.389 --> 04:17.548
For what?

04:17.624 --> 04:19.148
You may not want to know.

07:03.923 --> 07:07.381
Captain's Log, Stardate 52586.3.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.325
We've had a lot
to celebrate lately--

07:09.395 --> 07:12.296
Tom and B'Elanna's wedding,
Ensign Harper's new baby

07:12.365 --> 07:14.925
and the continued health
of our enhanced warp drive,

07:15.034 --> 07:18.401
which has taken us within
striking distance of home.

07:18.471 --> 07:20.996
ln this case, the shortest path
is a straight line.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.041
We'll pass right through
the center of the Milky Way.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.599
And be in Sector 001
within two years.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.143
More or less.

07:26.212 --> 07:28.772
You had Seven double-check
the calculations?

07:28.848 --> 07:30.042
Two years, 1 1 days, six hours,

07:30.116 --> 07:32.710
provided we continue to operate
at peak efficiency.

07:32.785 --> 07:33.877
Naturally.

07:33.986 --> 07:36.352
Of course, if we operate
at peak efficiency,

07:36.422 --> 07:38.856
we'll be missing some
interesting phenomena

07:38.925 --> 07:40.187
along the way--

07:40.259 --> 07:44.127
an anomalous gradient
to the curvature of space,

07:44.197 --> 07:46.631
unusual bioharmonic readings
from a binary system

07:46.699 --> 07:48.064
we'll reach
about six months from now.

07:48.167 --> 07:50.635
And the scientist in you can't
resist stopping to take a look.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.704
lt would only add another
two or three months.

07:52.772 --> 07:54.296
Do you think
the crew would mutiny?

07:54.407 --> 07:55.374
On the contrary.

07:55.441 --> 07:56.840
Everyone'll jump at the chance

07:56.909 --> 07:58.501
for some last-minute
exploration.

07:58.578 --> 07:59.510
Everyone...

07:59.579 --> 08:00.978
except Seven.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.547
Let your First Officer

08:02.582 --> 08:05.346
deal with
the personnel problems.

08:05.418 --> 08:06.749
Here's a lovely program

08:06.819 --> 08:08.582
modeled
after a mountain resort

08:08.654 --> 08:10.679
on the fifth moon of Cytrax--

08:10.756 --> 08:13.156
just you, B'Elanna
and the crickets.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.318
Crickets?

08:14.393 --> 08:15.826
Cytraxian crickets.

08:15.895 --> 08:21.128
Their song is reputed to be
an auditory aphrodisiac.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.464
Aha. Well, between you and me--

08:23.569 --> 08:26.163
B'Elanna and l
don't need aphrodisiacs.

08:28.908 --> 08:32.366
There's always the beaches
of Ahmedeen-- windsurfing

08:32.477 --> 08:33.808
on a sea of liquid argon.

08:33.880 --> 08:37.077
l was hoping for someplace
a little more down-to-earth.

08:37.149 --> 08:38.582
Well, it's your honeymoon.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.049
Just how down-to-earth
did you mean?

08:40.119 --> 08:41.177
Earth.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.017
l was thinking

08:43.089 --> 08:45.114
Chicago in the roaring '20s--

08:45.191 --> 08:48.217
speakeasies, flappers,
the Charleston.

08:48.294 --> 08:50.353
lf that's what you want.

08:50.429 --> 08:51.760
Why? ls there a problem?

08:51.831 --> 08:53.298
No, of course not,
it's just that we're

08:53.366 --> 08:54.628
so close to Earth anyway,

08:54.700 --> 08:56.827
l thought you might want to try
something a little more exotic.

08:56.936 --> 08:59.700
Let me let you in
on a little secret, Neelix.

08:59.805 --> 09:02.706
Earth has the best vacation
spots in the galaxy.

09:02.808 --> 09:04.935
lt's got the cultures,
the climates,

09:05.011 --> 09:06.478
the history, the people.

09:06.579 --> 09:09.742
lt has everything
you ever want in a planet.

09:09.815 --> 09:11.715
You sound
like a travel brochure.

09:12.852 --> 09:15.343
No. No. Just a native.

09:15.421 --> 09:17.446
Oh, and make sure
the deuterium manifold's

09:17.523 --> 09:19.320
are never opened wider
than 600 microns.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.121
l am familiar
with the specifications.

09:21.193 --> 09:22.990
Are you familiar
with how temperamental

09:23.062 --> 09:24.461
the isolytic converter can be?

09:24.530 --> 09:25.792
Yes.

09:25.865 --> 09:28.595
Most important,
the enhanced warp drive--

09:28.668 --> 09:30.932
with the dilithium matrix
running hot all the time now,

09:31.037 --> 09:32.402
you have to watch it
like a hawk.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.029
There is no point
in providing me

09:34.140 --> 09:35.698
with knowledge
l already possess.

09:36.809 --> 09:38.777
l guess l am being
a little overcautious.

09:38.844 --> 09:42.245
l've just, uh, never
been away from Engineering

09:42.315 --> 09:44.476
for more
than a couple of days...

09:44.550 --> 09:46.211
certainly never a week.

09:46.285 --> 09:48.879
My engineering abilities
are more than sufficient.

09:49.021 --> 09:50.386
Enjoy your honeymoon.

09:50.456 --> 09:53.687
You may understand
the iso-dynamics of this engine,

09:53.759 --> 09:56.887
but l don't think
you understand its personality.

09:56.996 --> 09:58.258
Personality.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.492
lt is a propulsion device.

10:00.566 --> 10:01.897
That's my point.

10:02.034 --> 10:03.433
lt's not just a device.

10:03.536 --> 10:06.164
lt-it has its own quirks,
its own... its own moods.

10:07.873 --> 10:11.206
That's just a minor fluctuation
in a subsidiary injector port.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.539
l will take care of it.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.045
l'm going with you.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.842
Lieutenant, you are on leave.

10:15.915 --> 10:17.610
Not for another 20 minutes.

10:23.422 --> 10:25.890
So, who's the lucky guy?

10:25.958 --> 10:27.289
You caught the bouquet.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.590
That means you're next
in line for the altar.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.323
Yes, the Doctor informed me

10:31.397 --> 10:33.592
of that archaic
human superstition.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.725
How about Harry Kim?

10:35.835 --> 10:39.271
l fail to see the benefit
of monogamous relationships.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.203
So you want to stay single?

10:41.273 --> 10:43.241
lf you mean remain open
to social situations

10:43.309 --> 10:44.799
with a wide variety
of individuals,

10:44.910 --> 10:45.968
then yes.

10:46.045 --> 10:47.808
l'm married--
l'm not going into stasis

10:47.880 --> 10:49.108
for the rest of my life.

10:49.181 --> 10:50.443
No, l plan to have...

10:50.516 --> 10:52.541
l do not wish to be
dependent on anyone.

10:52.618 --> 10:55.246
By marrying, one limits
one's romantic interactions

10:55.321 --> 10:56.549
to a single individual--

10:56.622 --> 10:58.988
a circumstance which
implies extreme monotony.

10:59.058 --> 11:00.719
l'm glad we had
this little talk.

11:03.462 --> 11:05.555
Try the manual release.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.698
l thought you said
it was a minor fluctuation.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.707
This entire Jefferies tube

11:15.775 --> 11:17.572
is losing
molecular cohesion.

11:17.643 --> 11:19.941
l guess the honeymoon's off.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.747
lt's our warp field.

11:22.815 --> 11:25.079
The enhanced drive is emitting

11:25.151 --> 11:26.948
some form
of subspace radiation

11:27.019 --> 11:29.249
that's affecting
Voyager's infrastructure.

11:29.321 --> 11:30.720
lt's beginning to break down

11:30.790 --> 11:32.417
the molecular bonds
in all surrounding sections.

11:32.491 --> 11:34.925
We're seeing
early stages of the effect

11:34.994 --> 11:35.926
in the warp core--

11:35.995 --> 11:37.929
reaction chamber,
injector ports--

11:37.997 --> 11:39.624
they're all showing signs
of de-cohesion.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.064
lt doesn't make any sense.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.725
We knew all about
the subspace radiation

11:42.835 --> 11:44.063
and we ran
dozens of simulations

11:44.170 --> 11:46.764
before we brought the new drive
on line.

11:46.872 --> 11:49.204
Have you tried taking
the core off-line?

11:49.275 --> 11:51.368
lt's not stopping the problem.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.706
Try to isolate
the cause of this.

11:54.780 --> 11:57.977
And stabilize the sections
that have already been affected.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.608
Dismissed.

12:13.599 --> 12:14.861
Computer.

12:14.934 --> 12:18.563
Begin Chief Engineer's Log,
supplemental.

12:20.973 --> 12:23.737
l've spent the last four hours

12:23.809 --> 12:27.609
analyzing
the warp field schematics,

12:27.680 --> 12:30.911
but l'm still no closer to
finding out what's going wrong.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.921
Computer, did it
just get colder in here?

12:36.989 --> 12:39.253
Negative.

12:39.325 --> 12:42.488
Raise the temperature
by five degrees.

12:59.745 --> 13:00.609
Hungry?

13:00.713 --> 13:02.203
Ah, can't join you tonight--

13:02.248 --> 13:03.510
dinner with B'Elanna.

13:03.582 --> 13:06.346
Married one day
and you're already domesticated.

13:06.418 --> 13:07.851
Jealous?

13:07.920 --> 13:09.114
Night, Harry.

13:10.689 --> 13:12.520
B'Elanna?

13:12.591 --> 13:14.320
lf we're going to live together,

13:14.393 --> 13:17.521
we're going to have to
compromise on the temperature.

13:17.596 --> 13:21.191
Computer, reset environmental
controls to standard.

13:21.267 --> 13:22.256
B'Elanna?

13:32.278 --> 13:33.711
Shh.

13:35.514 --> 13:36.776
Bring her in, quickly.

13:37.850 --> 13:40.011
lt looks like we've got
an epidemic on our hands.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.204
Acute cellular degradation?

14:00.306 --> 14:02.035
Their chromosomes
are breaking down

14:02.107 --> 14:03.597
at the molecular level.

14:03.709 --> 14:05.609
Proximity to the warp field.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.043
l believe so.

14:07.112 --> 14:08.875
B'Elanna
and my other three patients

14:09.014 --> 14:10.242
all work in Engineering.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.784
They've been subjected
to the heaviest exposure,

14:12.852 --> 14:14.319
but preliminary scans suggest

14:14.386 --> 14:16.877
the rest of the crew has
been affected as well...

14:17.022 --> 14:18.683
including the Captain.

14:18.757 --> 14:22.022
lt's only a matter of time
before you begin

14:22.094 --> 14:23.527
showing the same symptoms.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.157
We've shut down the warp drive,

14:27.233 --> 14:29.758
but the ship is
still deteriorating,

14:29.869 --> 14:31.632
and so are we.

14:31.737 --> 14:33.204
Why?

14:37.676 --> 14:40.577
Every bulkhead and conduit
from Deck 1 to 15

14:40.646 --> 14:42.876
show signs
of molecular de-cohesion.

14:42.948 --> 14:45.712
Even food from the replicator
shows signs of decay.

14:45.784 --> 14:46.944
As soon as anything
comes into contact

14:47.052 --> 14:48.952
with Voyager's atmosphere,
it's affected.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.282
That's what we
thought at first,

14:50.356 --> 14:51.687
but take a look at this.

14:51.757 --> 14:54.123
These vegetables are
completely free of decay.

14:54.193 --> 14:55.421
l thought you said
the replicators...

14:55.494 --> 14:56.756
They weren't replicated.

14:56.829 --> 14:59.389
l harvested them
on an away mission last week.

14:59.465 --> 15:01.831
The same goes
for these particle accelerators,

15:01.934 --> 15:04.596
the trilithium ore samples,
the keg of Hazari ale.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.570
All of them were brought aboard
over the last few months

15:06.639 --> 15:08.869
and none of them
is disintegrating.

15:08.941 --> 15:10.966
We haven't been able to narrow
the time frame precisely,

15:11.076 --> 15:12.873
but it appears that anything

15:12.978 --> 15:15.708
brought onboard over the past
30 to 40 weeks is immune.

15:15.781 --> 15:17.544
Something happened
to the ship months ago

15:17.616 --> 15:19.106
that's causing this decay.

15:19.184 --> 15:20.981
A logical conclusion.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.055
Eight months, 17 days ago--

15:24.123 --> 15:25.852
first contact with the Kmada.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.052
They tried to sabotage
our life-support systems

15:28.127 --> 15:30.152
with low-frequency
theta radiation.

15:30.229 --> 15:33.198
Any chance that could have
caused the phenomenon?

15:33.265 --> 15:34.425
Unlikely.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.797
Let's keep looking.

15:35.901 --> 15:37.892
The next event of note
took place

15:38.003 --> 15:40.528
nine months, two days ago
when the N'Kree

15:40.639 --> 15:43.802
tried to conscript Voyager
into their battle fleet.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.036
And failed.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.634
Next?

16:10.736 --> 16:12.431
Hey.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.972
Hey.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.137
How's my old lady?

16:21.313 --> 16:23.372
Well enough...

16:23.449 --> 16:26.350
to break your nose if
you call me that again.

16:30.956 --> 16:33.823
Here it is.

16:33.892 --> 16:35.450
What?

16:39.865 --> 16:41.924
Our honeymoon.

16:43.602 --> 16:44.796
Tell me.

16:50.576 --> 16:53.943
Six days and seven nights...

16:54.079 --> 16:56.570
in the historic Graystone Hotel

16:56.648 --> 17:00.175
in beautiful downtown
Chicago, circa 1928.

17:06.325 --> 17:09.488
Uh, wait till you see it--

17:09.560 --> 17:11.825
crystal chandeliers,

17:11.964 --> 17:14.454
wall-to-wall ltalian marble.

17:14.532 --> 17:18.469
We'll take a drive up Michigan
Avenue in a vintage Duesenberg,

17:18.537 --> 17:22.337
hobnob with the stars
of the silver screen,

17:22.407 --> 17:24.842
dance the Charleston
at a genuine speakeasy

17:24.910 --> 17:26.309
called the Green Mill.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.573
What do l wear?

17:30.783 --> 17:34.184
That's already taken care of.

17:34.253 --> 17:38.485
Our bags are packed and waiting
for us at the hotel.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.020
Champagne?

17:43.095 --> 17:44.687
lt's on ice...

17:46.465 --> 17:47.989
in a silver bucket...

17:50.035 --> 17:52.765
right next to our canopy bed.

17:57.309 --> 17:58.571
B'Elanna?

17:59.978 --> 18:02.344
Doctor?

18:04.349 --> 18:06.817
Cortical stimulator.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.513
lnitiate an iso-synaptic pulse.

18:12.224 --> 18:13.691
lt's not working.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.056
Again!

18:17.296 --> 18:20.697
lncrease the electrolytic levels
to 7 5 millijoules.

18:27.406 --> 18:29.738
We've lost her.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.046
lncreasing electrolytic levels

18:37.116 --> 18:38.174
to 90 millijoules.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.218
There's nothing more we can do.

18:40.285 --> 18:43.448
Uh, maybe we can try
a direct neural resequencing.

18:43.522 --> 18:44.784
Lieutenant...

18:44.857 --> 18:46.825
We can't just let her die!

18:47.893 --> 18:49.383
Return to your quarters.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.291
No!

18:54.133 --> 18:56.124
l don't want to leave her.

18:56.201 --> 18:57.566
l understand,

18:57.669 --> 19:00.661
but l need
to perform an analysis

19:00.772 --> 19:03.605
before her cells have
completely degraded.

19:03.675 --> 19:04.733
Please.

19:20.692 --> 19:22.626
Nine months, 28 days.

19:22.694 --> 19:24.719
We collected silicate
from a comet

19:24.796 --> 19:26.161
in the Podaris sector.

19:26.231 --> 19:28.256
According to Neelix's manifest,

19:28.333 --> 19:30.858
those samples are stored
in the geology lab.

19:32.638 --> 19:35.835
They're showing no signs
of molecular degradation.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.637
Take us further back.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.677
Ten months, 1 1 days ago.

19:39.778 --> 19:41.973
Voyager was forced to land

19:42.047 --> 19:44.481
on a Class-Y planetoid
in the Vaskan sector.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.211
The Demon-Class planet...

19:46.285 --> 19:48.776
one of our more
interesting missions.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.880
We set down looking
for deuterium and ended up

19:51.990 --> 19:54.049
helping a new form of life
to be born.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.991
The planet possessed
a biomimetic compound.

19:56.061 --> 19:57.585
The ''silver blood.''

19:57.663 --> 20:00.461
lt sampled our DNA
and created duplicates

20:00.532 --> 20:01.829
of the entire crew.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.334
l've often wondered
what happened to them.

20:04.403 --> 20:05.768
Are they flourishing?

20:05.837 --> 20:07.896
Have they continued to evolve?

20:08.073 --> 20:09.768
Do they still resemble us?

20:16.515 --> 20:17.846
ls she...?

20:17.916 --> 20:20.544
l'm afraid so.

20:20.619 --> 20:22.712
Scan for traces of deuterium,

20:22.788 --> 20:24.517
hydrogen sulfate
and dichromates.

20:24.590 --> 20:25.921
Dichromates?

20:25.991 --> 20:27.185
Just do it.

20:32.864 --> 20:34.388
What's this about?

20:34.466 --> 20:37.435
We have a disturbing theory.

20:37.502 --> 20:39.527
l'm detecting
all of those compounds.

20:39.638 --> 20:42.198
l want you to inject her
with a dichromate catalyst.

20:42.307 --> 20:43.740
Commander?

20:43.809 --> 20:45.242
We've got to be sure.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.890
l don't understand.

21:06.031 --> 21:07.555
That wasn't B'Elanna.

21:07.633 --> 21:10.466
lt was a duplicate...

21:10.569 --> 21:12.503
a biomimetic copy.

21:12.571 --> 21:14.095
Copy?

21:14.206 --> 21:16.572
We are all duplicates.

21:16.642 --> 21:19.042
None of us are real.

21:28.687 --> 21:31.850
Behold the primordial soup.

21:31.923 --> 21:33.447
That's what created us.

21:33.525 --> 21:34.549
Not just us.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.958
The entire ship is composed
of the same material.

21:37.095 --> 21:38.460
lt's a biomimetic compound

21:38.530 --> 21:41.465
that duplicated the crew's
molecular structure so precisely

21:41.533 --> 21:42.966
that l would never
have detected it

21:43.135 --> 21:45.103
if l hadn't known
what to look for.

21:45.170 --> 21:47.934
l was born on Earth...
in lndiana.

21:48.006 --> 21:49.530
l remember growing up there.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.007
l remember graduating
from the Academy.

21:52.077 --> 21:54.341
l have no memory
of being a copy.

21:54.413 --> 21:57.610
Apparently, the original
Kathryn Janeway's memories

21:57.683 --> 21:59.275
were duplicated as well.

21:59.351 --> 22:01.876
Somehow,
after the real Voyager left,

22:01.987 --> 22:05.286
we began to forget
we were duplicates.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.519
Eventually,
we assumed their lives

22:07.592 --> 22:09.219
and set a course for Earth.

22:10.529 --> 22:11.860
And now the warp core

22:11.930 --> 22:13.761
is breaking down
our cellular structure.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.630
We didn't think
the radiation would hurt us,

22:16.735 --> 22:18.066
because it isn't harmful
to humanoids.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.728
Each and every one of you

22:19.838 --> 22:21.897
will disintegrate
just as B'Elanna did.

22:22.074 --> 22:23.564
l'm not immune, either.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.166
The holo-emitters, like
everything else, are copies.

22:26.278 --> 22:27.267
lt's only a matter of time

22:27.346 --> 22:29.473
before my program begins
to degrade.

22:29.548 --> 22:30.947
What can we do
to stop the process?

22:31.083 --> 22:32.880
There is one option.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.380
Go back.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.718
To the Demon-Class planet?

22:37.789 --> 22:40.155
We were created
to survive there.

22:40.225 --> 22:41.852
He's correct.

22:41.927 --> 22:43.326
lt's reasonable to assume

22:43.395 --> 22:45.329
that if we return
to our native environment,

22:45.397 --> 22:46.728
the degradation will cease.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.296
Even if we survived the trip,

22:50.402 --> 22:51.960
we'd be traveling thousands

22:52.137 --> 22:54.571
of light-years
in the wrong direction.

22:54.639 --> 22:56.163
lt may be the only way.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.341
Duplicate or not,

23:00.445 --> 23:02.470
l'm still the same person
l was yesterday,

23:02.514 --> 23:03.879
and so are all of you...

23:04.015 --> 23:06.540
and that means we're going
to do everything possible

23:06.618 --> 23:09.018
to complete our mission,
which is to reach Earth.

23:09.087 --> 23:10.054
ls that clear?

23:10.122 --> 23:11.885
-Yes, ma'am.
-l want you

23:11.957 --> 23:13.481
to adjust
the environmental controls

23:13.558 --> 23:14.889
to simulate a Class-Y planet.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.689
That should slow the rate
of degradation.

23:16.762 --> 23:19.196
lt's only a matter of time
before the environmental

23:19.264 --> 23:20.629
controls themselves
are affected.

23:20.699 --> 23:22.098
l realize that.

23:22.167 --> 23:24.397
That's why we're going
to try and find a safe harbor

23:24.503 --> 23:26.698
till we can figure out a way
to stop the degradation.

23:26.805 --> 23:30.673
Scan for the nearest
Class-Y planet and set a course.

23:30.742 --> 23:31.936
ln the meantime...

23:32.077 --> 23:34.875
l'll explain our situation
to the crew.

23:40.018 --> 23:42.350
There's still a great deal
we don't know

23:42.421 --> 23:43.820
about this phenomenon,

23:43.889 --> 23:47.222
and l have every confidence
we'll find a way to reverse it.

23:47.292 --> 23:49.351
So you're saying
all our experiences

23:49.428 --> 23:52.192
before we were duplicated--
none of it's real?

23:53.598 --> 23:56.795
l don't pretend to understand it
myself, Harry...

23:56.902 --> 24:00.167
but the way l choose
to look at it is this--

24:00.238 --> 24:03.036
if everything
about us was duplicated,

24:03.108 --> 24:05.804
that includes
our memory engrams,

24:05.877 --> 24:08.607
the emotional centers
of our brain.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.171
So, if you feel something...

24:11.249 --> 24:13.080
remember something...

24:13.151 --> 24:15.779
believe something...

24:15.854 --> 24:18.516
l'm not about to tell you
it's not real.

24:18.590 --> 24:21.889
But there is another crew
out there, right?

24:22.027 --> 24:23.517
The real Voyager.

24:23.595 --> 24:26.462
l suppose there is,
but l don't want that thought

24:26.531 --> 24:28.863
to distract any of you
from our mission.

24:28.934 --> 24:30.731
What mission is that?

24:34.539 --> 24:36.769
The same
as it's always been, Tom--

24:36.842 --> 24:39.436
to reach the Alpha Quadrant
safe and sound,

24:39.511 --> 24:40.842
but to do that,

24:40.912 --> 24:43.676
we're going to have
to beat this problem...

24:45.250 --> 24:47.946
and for now,
that means conserving energy,

24:48.053 --> 24:52.217
running the ship in gray mode,
cutting crew shifts in half.

24:52.290 --> 24:56.420
The less you exert yourselves,
the slower the cellular decay.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.359
Duplicates or not...

25:01.466 --> 25:03.559
you're still my crew.

25:03.635 --> 25:05.296
Dismissed.

25:09.541 --> 25:11.532
Tom...

25:11.643 --> 25:14.077
There's no one
here by that name.

25:14.145 --> 25:16.375
l just wanted to say...

25:16.448 --> 25:18.473
l'm sorry about B'Elanna.

25:18.550 --> 25:19.482
Sorry?

25:19.551 --> 25:20.518
What for?

25:20.585 --> 25:22.917
She was your wife.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.483
She was a duplicate...

25:26.558 --> 25:28.355
just like you are, Harry.

25:28.426 --> 25:29.791
You heard the Captain.

25:29.861 --> 25:31.522
lf we're going to survive this,

25:31.596 --> 25:33.291
we've got to believe
in ourselves.

25:36.034 --> 25:38.366
You can drop
the good soldier routine.

25:38.470 --> 25:42.304
You don't have to do everything
the Captain says anymore.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.569
Hell, she's not
even the Captain.

25:44.643 --> 25:46.406
She is to me.

25:46.478 --> 25:50.278
Okay. Well, let's suppose
she does get us back to Earth.

25:50.348 --> 25:51.337
What then?

25:51.416 --> 25:53.407
You really think your family

25:53.485 --> 25:56.249
is going to welcome
you with open arms?

25:56.321 --> 25:57.948
l don't know.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.853
For all you know,
the real Harry Kim

25:59.925 --> 26:02.120
is having Sunday dinner
with them right now.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.286
And you come strolling
through the door,

26:04.329 --> 26:05.694
they're going to see you

26:05.764 --> 26:08.028
for exactly what you
are-- an impostor.

26:08.099 --> 26:10.329
So what are we going to do, huh?

26:10.435 --> 26:12.995
Wait around
till we all disintegrate?

26:26.351 --> 26:27.818
Come in.

26:29.354 --> 26:32.983
Chicken paprikash--
my grandmother's recipe.

26:33.058 --> 26:37.757
Well, maybe not my grandmother,
but it's still delicious.

26:37.829 --> 26:39.854
lt's our weekly dinner together.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.489
Don't tell me you forgot.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.899
We've lost three more people.

26:45.036 --> 26:46.833
We've got to head back.

26:49.407 --> 26:52.501
l've spent the past five years
trying to get this crew home.

26:52.577 --> 26:54.408
l'm not about to quit now.

26:54.479 --> 26:55.878
Listen to yourself.

26:55.947 --> 26:58.381
You haven't even been alive
for five years.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.577
Home is a Class-Y planet
in the Delta Quadrant.

27:00.685 --> 27:02.516
We don't belong on Earth.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.215
How do you know where we belong?

27:04.289 --> 27:05.722
For all we know,

27:05.790 --> 27:07.223
the real Voyager's
been destroyed

27:07.292 --> 27:08.725
and we're all that's left.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.556
For all we know,

27:10.629 --> 27:13.530
we're supposed
to be living their lives.

27:13.598 --> 27:15.463
That's a pretty big
assumption...

27:15.533 --> 27:17.694
and it's putting this crew
in danger.

27:21.106 --> 27:23.472
There's only one thing
l know how to be, Chakotay,

27:23.541 --> 27:25.600
and that's Kathryn Janeway.

27:25.677 --> 27:26.609
l'd like to think

27:26.678 --> 27:28.339
l know Captain Janeway
pretty well myself,

27:28.413 --> 27:30.608
and as much as she'd like
to get her crew home,

27:30.682 --> 27:34.448
l don't think she'd be willing
to kill them in the process.

27:37.689 --> 27:41.125
Maybe this dinner wasn't
such a good idea after all.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.563
l've tried everything
l can think of--

27:54.673 --> 27:56.698
bio-molecular enhancers,

27:56.808 --> 27:58.935
gene splicing
with replicated DNA--

27:59.010 --> 28:01.570
and l'm no closer
to finding a cure.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.272
But l do have an idea.

28:03.314 --> 28:04.246
l'm listening.

28:04.315 --> 28:05.942
Find the original Voyager.

28:06.017 --> 28:07.575
lf the real Captain Janeway
were here,

28:07.652 --> 28:09.313
we could sample her DNA

28:09.387 --> 28:11.446
and imprint it
onto your mimetic pattern.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.753
But, Doctor, we have no way
of knowing where they are.

28:13.825 --> 28:16.020
They could be behind
us, ahead of us,

28:16.094 --> 28:17.721
back on Earth...
destroyed.

28:17.796 --> 28:20.822
Besides, even if we could
find the real Janeway,

28:20.899 --> 28:22.594
how do we know she'd help?

28:22.667 --> 28:24.259
She's you.

28:25.570 --> 28:27.265
My emitter's
starting to degrade.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.306
You better get back to Sick Bay.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.306
Tuvok to the Captain.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.843
Sensors have detected
a Class-Y planet.

28:32.944 --> 28:35.037
On my way.

28:35.113 --> 28:37.604
lt may not be home,
but it checks out.

28:37.682 --> 28:38.876
Thermionic radiation...

28:39.017 --> 28:41.645
surface temperatures in
excess of 500 kelvins.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.689
Just what the Doctor ordered.

28:44.756 --> 28:46.383
Safe harbor?

28:46.458 --> 28:49.052
There's no guarantee
this is going to work.

28:50.729 --> 28:55.189
Harry, vent all plasma
from the nacelles.

28:55.266 --> 28:58.497
Transfer available power
to atmospheric thrusters

28:58.603 --> 29:00.298
and stand by to commence
landing sequence.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.305
Yes, ma'am.

29:02.373 --> 29:03.863
Red Alert.

29:03.975 --> 29:06.068
Landing struts on line.

29:06.144 --> 29:08.078
lnertial dampers at maximum.

29:08.146 --> 29:10.341
Take us down, Mr. Paris.

29:11.382 --> 29:13.145
Captain, a vessel is approaching

29:13.218 --> 29:14.651
from the planet's surface.

29:14.719 --> 29:16.448
On screen.

29:16.521 --> 29:18.512
They're hailing.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.285
Open a channel.

29:20.358 --> 29:24.818
You're in direct violation
of the Ord'Mirit Mining Treaty.

29:24.929 --> 29:27.159
Leave orbit
or you'll be destroyed.

29:29.300 --> 29:30.858
They are firing weapons.

29:53.057 --> 29:55.082
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway

29:55.160 --> 29:57.856
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

29:57.929 --> 30:00.523
We are not your enemy.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.533
They seem to disagree.

30:03.635 --> 30:06.365
We're not interested
in your mining operation.

30:06.471 --> 30:07.904
Our ship is badly damaged.

30:07.972 --> 30:10.941
We need to set down
on the surface to make repairs.

30:11.075 --> 30:14.044
We repeat:
Leave or be destroyed.

30:15.547 --> 30:17.777
Shields down to 52 percent.

30:17.849 --> 30:19.407
With our systems degrading,

30:19.484 --> 30:22.044
we won't be able
to take this much longer.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.850
Target their weapon systems.

30:24.923 --> 30:25.890
Fire.

30:27.425 --> 30:28.790
No effect.

30:30.195 --> 30:32.322
Hull breaches
on Decks 1 1, 14 and 15.

30:32.397 --> 30:35.798
The damaged sections are turning
into biomimetic matter.

30:35.867 --> 30:37.300
Containment fields are failing.

30:37.402 --> 30:39.131
Evacuate those decks.

30:39.237 --> 30:42.104
lf we emit a polaron burst,
we can disable their shields

30:42.173 --> 30:43.868
long enough to target
their warp core.

30:43.942 --> 30:46.308
No. We're not going
to destroy them

30:46.377 --> 30:48.004
over a misunderstanding.

30:48.112 --> 30:50.046
Either that or retreat.

30:55.119 --> 30:56.848
We're Starfleet officers.

30:56.921 --> 30:58.388
We can't forget that.

30:58.456 --> 31:00.219
Break orbit.

31:00.325 --> 31:03.158
That planet may be our
last chance for survival.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.287
We'll have to find
another option.

31:05.363 --> 31:08.423
l'm not sure why we're
still taking orders from you.

31:08.499 --> 31:10.626
Lieutenant, follow orders
or leave the Bridge.

31:16.007 --> 31:18.168
The alien vessel's not pursuing.

31:18.243 --> 31:21.644
Begin scanning
for other Class-Y planets.

31:21.713 --> 31:26.343
Harry, transmit a distress call
on all subspace bands.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.282
lf the real Voyager
is out there,

31:28.353 --> 31:29.945
l want to find them.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.282
ln the meantime,

31:31.356 --> 31:34.382
which direction
do you want me to go?

31:35.827 --> 31:39.228
Resume course for the Alpha
Quadrant, Mr. Paris.

31:50.341 --> 31:53.504
l know what you're going to say
and l don't want to hear it.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.011
Too bad.

31:55.113 --> 31:57.377
l'm willing to take a
little insolence from Tom,

31:57.448 --> 31:59.006
but l shouldn't have
to remind you

31:59.117 --> 32:00.311
that l'm still the Captain.

32:00.418 --> 32:01.680
You're not.

32:01.719 --> 32:04.711
You're a biomimetic life-form
created in her image.

32:04.789 --> 32:07.883
Are you saying you're not taking
orders from me anymore?

32:08.026 --> 32:09.789
l'm saying
you need to step back

32:09.861 --> 32:13.058
and look at our situation
objectively.

32:13.131 --> 32:15.099
You think l should
have given the order

32:15.166 --> 32:16.360
to fire on that vessel.

32:16.434 --> 32:19.494
No. l agreed with your
decision to stand down,

32:19.604 --> 32:22.596
but how long can we adhere
to Starfleet principles

32:22.707 --> 32:24.675
before we start making
compromises?

32:24.776 --> 32:26.744
As long as it takes.

32:26.844 --> 32:29.506
Our ship may be deteriorating,

32:29.580 --> 32:32.105
but our humanity is intact.

32:32.183 --> 32:34.947
Belief alone won't hold
this ship together.

32:35.086 --> 32:36.678
lt's gotten us this far.

32:36.754 --> 32:38.244
Not far enough.

32:39.590 --> 32:43.048
Tom and l aren't the only ones
who question your decisions.

32:43.127 --> 32:44.355
Now that the truth is known,

32:44.429 --> 32:46.556
a lot of people think
we should turn around

32:46.631 --> 32:48.258
and head for the Class-Y planet.

32:48.333 --> 32:51.302
They're starting to remember
their existence before Voyager.

32:51.369 --> 32:52.836
What?

32:52.904 --> 32:56.635
What existence?

32:56.708 --> 32:59.142
Pools of biomimetic fluid?

32:59.210 --> 33:01.701
We didn't even experience
sentience

33:01.813 --> 33:03.576
until Voyager came along.

33:03.614 --> 33:04.979
What good is sentience

33:05.049 --> 33:07.483
if we're not alive
to experience it?

33:07.552 --> 33:10.077
Kathryn, we've got to go back.

33:10.154 --> 33:13.089
l promised the crew
l'd get them home.

33:13.157 --> 33:15.591
Home isn't Earth.

33:21.332 --> 33:25.291
Janeway to Sick Bay.
Medical emergency.

33:27.805 --> 33:28.829
He's not responding.

33:31.576 --> 33:34.044
His neural pathways
are destabilizing.

33:55.666 --> 33:58.658
We've lost Commander Chakotay.

34:00.238 --> 34:03.173
Duplicate or not,
he was real to me...

34:06.110 --> 34:09.306
and he was
a fine Starfleet officer.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.745
And...

34:16.621 --> 34:18.213
he was a friend...

34:19.690 --> 34:20.884
who...

34:22.360 --> 34:25.261
wasn't afraid to let me know
when l am wrong.

34:28.933 --> 34:30.092
Mr. Kim,

34:30.201 --> 34:33.931
bring the enhanced
warp drive on line.

34:37.975 --> 34:39.442
Turn Voyager around.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.710
We're going home.

34:43.781 --> 34:45.646
Captain...

34:47.085 --> 34:48.518
Set a course...

34:50.254 --> 34:52.085
for the Demon planet.

35:05.870 --> 35:07.770
Captain's Log, supplemental.

35:07.839 --> 35:12.037
We've lost 63 crewmen, and our
systems are continuing to fail.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.011
Though we're still five weeks
away from the Demon planet,

35:15.079 --> 35:16.842
we haven't given up hope.

35:16.914 --> 35:18.609
The holographic projectors
in Sick Bay

35:18.683 --> 35:21.049
went off-line at 0300.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.178
We've lost the Doctor.

35:24.555 --> 35:26.489
What's Tom's condition?

35:26.557 --> 35:28.457
No change.

35:28.526 --> 35:30.460
Well... hmm...

35:30.528 --> 35:33.554
looks like we're in the market
for a new medical officer.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.292
Feel up to it, Neelix?

35:37.735 --> 35:40.203
l've only been trained
as a field medic.

35:40.271 --> 35:42.000
lt'll have to do.

35:43.074 --> 35:45.542
What about my other duties?

35:45.610 --> 35:48.579
Make Sick Bay your priority.

35:50.348 --> 35:52.646
At this point...

35:52.717 --> 35:54.344
morale is a luxury.

35:54.418 --> 35:56.750
How's the core holding up?

35:56.821 --> 35:58.186
The modified nanoprobes are

35:58.256 --> 35:59.951
still reinforcing
the warp field.

36:00.024 --> 36:03.187
lt should remain functioning
until we reach the Demon planet.

36:03.227 --> 36:05.559
However, there is less
than a 20 percent probability

36:05.596 --> 36:07.791
that Voyager will remain intact
that long.

36:10.301 --> 36:12.030
Well...

36:12.136 --> 36:15.162
it won't be the first time
this crew has been...

36:17.108 --> 36:18.075
up against...

36:18.176 --> 36:19.871
Captain?

36:20.011 --> 36:22.605
lt's all right. l'm just...

36:24.182 --> 36:26.582
a little tired.

36:26.651 --> 36:28.710
Let Ensign Kim
take command for a while.

36:28.786 --> 36:30.754
l'm still the Captain.

36:30.821 --> 36:34.450
And l am
the Chief Medical Officer.

36:34.525 --> 36:38.086
Don't force me
to relieve you of your duties.

36:38.162 --> 36:43.099
Your concerns have been noted...
sir.

36:51.909 --> 36:54.002
Now...

36:55.746 --> 36:58.510
there is another matter.

36:58.583 --> 37:01.984
l want to download
the ship's database...

37:02.086 --> 37:05.783
and our personal logs
into a signal beacon.

37:08.326 --> 37:10.385
ln the event we don't survive,

37:10.461 --> 37:14.420
there should be some record
of our accomplishments.

37:14.498 --> 37:16.193
A time capsule.

37:18.269 --> 37:21.238
This crew's existence
may have been brief...

37:22.773 --> 37:25.105
but it's been distinguished.

37:28.045 --> 37:30.513
None of you...

37:33.551 --> 37:36.019
deserves to be forgotten.

37:39.457 --> 37:42.756
l will use unaffected components
to construct a beacon.

38:00.578 --> 38:02.944
The deflector's off-line.

38:03.014 --> 38:06.279
lnterstellar dust is
contaminating the warp field.

38:06.350 --> 38:07.681
Purge it.

38:07.752 --> 38:09.049
l can't.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.247
The exhaust manifolds
have disintegrated.

38:15.326 --> 38:18.489
We've come too far
to be stopped by dust.

38:20.564 --> 38:23.124
Reroute auxiliary power
to the deflector.

38:24.201 --> 38:26.829
Warp field failure in eight...

38:26.937 --> 38:27.961
seven...

38:28.072 --> 38:29.004
six...

38:29.073 --> 38:30.540
five...

38:30.641 --> 38:31.699
four...

38:31.809 --> 38:33.106
three...

38:33.177 --> 38:34.235
Got it.

38:34.312 --> 38:38.373
Reinitializing the deflector.

38:38.449 --> 38:40.974
The warp field has stabilized.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.646
l may not be
morale officer anymore,

38:46.724 --> 38:49.887
but l think this is
a cause for celebration.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.825
What do you say, Captain?

38:55.566 --> 38:57.090
Captain?

39:08.045 --> 39:09.706
She's gone.

39:24.161 --> 39:28.928
Acting Captain's Log,
Stardate 52597.4.

39:28.999 --> 39:33.561
Our situation's getting worse
every day.

39:33.671 --> 39:36.401
More than 80 percent
of the ship is uninhabitable.

39:36.474 --> 39:38.408
Most of the crew are gone.

39:38.476 --> 39:40.569
lt seems less and less likely
that the few of us left

39:40.644 --> 39:41.770
will reach our destination.

39:52.690 --> 39:55.215
Computer, hull status.

39:55.292 --> 39:58.557
Hull integrity at 45 percent.

40:00.197 --> 40:01.994
What was that?

40:02.066 --> 40:05.160
Cargo Bay 2 has decompressed.

40:05.269 --> 40:07.999
Seal off that deck.

40:13.611 --> 40:17.707
Computer, erect a level-10
force field around the Bridge.

40:17.782 --> 40:19.113
Unable to comply.

40:19.183 --> 40:20.878
Seven...

40:20.951 --> 40:22.316
l need more power up here.

40:22.386 --> 40:24.047
The bulkheads are coming apart.

40:24.121 --> 40:26.453
l'm transferring the last
of our power reserves.

40:30.394 --> 40:33.192
Deck 1 force field is in place.

40:34.565 --> 40:35.964
That's better.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.362
How's life support?

40:37.468 --> 40:38.799
Degrading.

40:38.903 --> 40:41.133
We have approximately
ten hours of air remaining.

40:41.238 --> 40:44.173
What about the time capsule?

40:44.241 --> 40:45.799
lt's ready for launch.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.211
Do it.

40:54.652 --> 40:56.950
The launch sequencer
has misfired.

40:57.021 --> 40:59.012
Reset the initiator;
try it again.

41:00.057 --> 41:00.989
lt won't work.

41:01.091 --> 41:03.525
The launch mechanism is
demolecularized.

41:03.594 --> 41:05.289
Salvage the probe.

41:07.331 --> 41:09.356
lt's too late.

41:09.433 --> 41:10.991
lt's been destroyed.

41:12.670 --> 41:15.138
Personal logs...

41:15.206 --> 41:17.037
mission logs...

41:17.107 --> 41:19.041
all our history...

41:19.109 --> 41:21.168
gone.

41:22.646 --> 41:24.238
Now what?

41:25.816 --> 41:27.647
l'm detecting a vessel...

41:27.718 --> 41:29.242
22 light-years away.

41:36.260 --> 41:37.750
l see it.

41:42.666 --> 41:45.863
l'm trying to hail them.

41:45.970 --> 41:48.268
The subspace transceiver's
malfunctioning.

41:49.974 --> 41:52.374
lf they move out of range,
they won't see us.

41:53.811 --> 41:55.574
We still have
one active com circuit,

41:55.646 --> 41:57.773
but we'll have to go
to impulse to use it.

41:57.848 --> 41:59.315
Seven, drop out of warp.

41:59.383 --> 42:01.783
The engine controls are fused.

42:01.886 --> 42:02.784
Then unfuse them.

42:02.820 --> 42:05.914
Without an isolytic converter,
l cannot comply.

42:06.991 --> 42:08.390
Dump the core.

42:08.459 --> 42:10.450
Ensign, dropping out of warp
at this velocity

42:10.528 --> 42:11.688
could tear the ship apart.

42:11.762 --> 42:13.457
We're already falling apart.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.123
We're not going to make it

42:15.199 --> 42:17.258
to the Class-Y planet
in one piece,

42:17.368 --> 42:20.531
which means that ship is
our only hope.

42:22.072 --> 42:23.471
Think about it.

42:25.242 --> 42:27.802
What would Captain Janeway
have done?

42:30.581 --> 42:34.142
Computer, prepare to eject
the warp core.

42:34.218 --> 42:37.949
Authorization: Seven of Nine-
omega-phi-nine-three.

42:38.022 --> 42:39.956
Warp ejection systems enabled.

42:42.526 --> 42:44.153
Eject the core.

42:50.034 --> 42:52.969
We've lost
attitude control and shields.

42:53.037 --> 42:55.096
Hull integrity at 19 percent.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.175
Reroute life support!

42:59.243 --> 43:00.574
Hell, reroute everything
we've got left

43:00.678 --> 43:01.645
to the containment fields.

43:07.151 --> 43:10.314
Hull breaches
on Decks 9, 10 and 1 1.

43:13.557 --> 43:14.854
Seven.

43:14.925 --> 43:15.914
Seven!

43:19.196 --> 43:20.663
Computer...

43:20.731 --> 43:23.291
how long until we're within
hailing range of that ship?

43:23.367 --> 43:25.892
F-f-f-five minutes
and 30 seconds.

43:26.036 --> 43:28.527
F-f-f-five minutes and
30 seconds.

43:34.979 --> 43:36.913
Range?

43:36.981 --> 43:38.676
Five million kilometers.

43:38.749 --> 43:41.149
Try hailing again.

43:42.419 --> 43:44.353
No response.

43:44.421 --> 43:46.912
Captain, l've found the source
of the distress call.

43:46.991 --> 43:48.151
lt's coming from a vessel.

43:48.225 --> 43:49.351
Can you identify it?

43:49.426 --> 43:51.189
No. The readings are erratic.

43:51.261 --> 43:53.593
Looks like they've taken
heavy damage.

43:53.664 --> 43:55.495
400,000 kilometers.

43:55.566 --> 43:57.557
Drop to impulse.
Are the rescue teams ready?

43:59.136 --> 44:01.229
Bridge to Sick Bay.
Stand by for casualties.

44:01.338 --> 44:02.669
ln visual range.

44:02.740 --> 44:04.071
On screen.

44:08.479 --> 44:09.673
Where's the ship?

44:10.748 --> 44:11.976
No sign of it.

44:12.049 --> 44:14.313
That debris... that couldn't be
all that's left.

44:14.385 --> 44:18.116
l'm detecting residual
deuterium, antineutrons,

44:18.188 --> 44:19.883
traces of dichromates.

44:20.024 --> 44:23.050
lf it was a vessel,
it isn't anymore.

44:23.127 --> 44:25.652
Scan for life signs,
escape pods.

44:26.730 --> 44:28.220
None.

44:35.172 --> 44:37.231
Make a note
in the ship's record--

44:37.341 --> 44:40.936
we received a distress
call at 0900 hours.

44:41.011 --> 44:44.538
Arrived at the vessel's
last known coordinates at 2120.

44:48.485 --> 44:50.953
The ship was destroyed.

44:51.055 --> 44:52.682
Cause unknown.

44:54.591 --> 44:56.616
No survivors.

44:58.929 --> 45:00.794
Mr. Paris, resume course.

45:00.898 --> 45:02.092
Aye, sir.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
