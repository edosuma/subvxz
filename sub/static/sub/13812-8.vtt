THE ANALYSIS.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.712
WAIT...
WHAT'S THAT?

08:35.816 --> 08:38.183
I THINK I'M GOING
TO BE SICK.

09:05.812 --> 09:08.713
PATRICK AND SPONGEBOB,
GET OUT OF MY BEDROOM

09:08.715 --> 09:10.916
AND GIVE ME BACK MY TENTACLES.

09:10.918 --> 09:11.516
IT'S AWAKE!

09:11.518 --> 09:13.718
LET'S CAPTURE
THE LITTLE PHONY.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.587
OH, GET AWAY FROM ME.

09:15.589 --> 09:18.156
(<i> yelling</i> )

09:20.127 --> 09:24.029
(<i> yelling and noise inside</i> )

09:26.600 --> 09:28.366
AHOY, THERE, LADS.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.469
UP A BIT LATE TO

09:35.008 --> 09:38.843
OKAY, OKAY, SHOOT ME,
BUT DON'T TAKE ME MONEY.

09:38.845 --> 09:42.447
WE DON'T WANT YOUR
MONEY, MOON MAN.
