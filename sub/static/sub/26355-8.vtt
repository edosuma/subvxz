Gentlemen,
due to a disastrous investment

19:55.542 --> 19:58.371
in a Mindy Project
amusement park,

19:58.414 --> 20:00.242
Miss Woolworth etcetera,
etcetera,

20:00.286 --> 20:03.245
died owing $18 million,

20:03.289 --> 20:05.639
for which you are now liable.

20:05.682 --> 20:07.336
We owe money?

20:07.380 --> 20:09.033
Look, Stewie,
it-it could be worse.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.600
We could be dead, like Margaret.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.515
You're right. Poor thing.

20:12.559 --> 20:15.910
I guess she just died
of natural causes.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.307
What a couple of rubes.

20:21.350 --> 20:24.397
I'm finally out
from under that crushing debt.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.443
I suppose
I don't need this anymore.

20:29.445 --> 20:32.318
Yes, that's right.
It was a Meg story.
