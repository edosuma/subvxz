04:25.800 --> 04:27.564
<i>Good morning, James.</i>

04:27.680 --> 04:28.841
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

04:29.080 --> 04:30.127
Wait. What?

04:30.520 --> 04:33.285
<i>It's perfectly normal to feel confused.</i>

04:33.360 --> 04:36.921
<i>You just spent 120 years
in suspended animation.</i>

04:37.520 --> 04:38.521
What?

04:38.880 --> 04:40.325
<i>It's okay, James.</i>

04:40.880 --> 04:42.882
- It's Jim.
<i>- Jim.</i>

04:43.720 --> 04:46.690
<i>Just breathe. Everything is okay.</i>

04:46.800 --> 04:48.086
Where am I?

04:48.160 --> 04:50.242
<i>You're a passenger on the</i> Starship Avalon,

04:50.320 --> 04:53.961
<i>the Homestead Company's
premier interstellar starliner.</i>

04:55.320 --> 04:58.688
<i>We've nearly completed the voyage
from Earth to your new home.</i>

04:59.080 --> 05:01.128
<i>The colony world of Homestead II.</i>

05:02.400 --> 05:04.971
<i>A new world. A fresh start.</i>

05:05.040 --> 05:06.565
<i>Room to grow.</i>

05:06.640 --> 05:08.324
Oh, yeah.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.448
<i>The</i> Avalon <i>is on final approach.</i>

05:10.520 --> 05:12.602
<i>For the next four months,
you'll enjoy space travel</i>

05:12.680 --> 05:14.569
<i>at its most luxurious.</i>

05:15.160 --> 05:17.561
<i>Food. Fun. Friends.</i>

05:17.640 --> 05:20.086
- My friends.
<i>- That's right, Jim.</i>

05:20.440 --> 05:23.523
<i>The ID band on your wrist is your key
to the wonders of the</i> Avalon.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.889
<i>You're in perfect health, Jim.</i>

05:27.960 --> 05:30.486
<i>Let's get you to your cabin,
where you can get some rest.</i>

05:38.480 --> 05:39.896
<i>You may be experiencing</i>

05:39.920 --> 05:41.365
<i>post-hibernation sickness.</i>

05:43.640 --> 05:45.961
<i>Your door will illuminate for you.</i>

05:49.200 --> 05:50.531
<i>Welcome to your cabin,</i>

05:50.600 --> 05:52.921
<i>your home until we make landfall.</i>

05:53.040 --> 05:54.121
<i>Over the next four months,</i>

05:54.200 --> 05:57.090
<i>you'll prepare for your new life
on Homestead II,</i>

05:57.520 --> 06:00.649
<i>meet your fellow passengers,
take skill-building classes,</i>

06:00.720 --> 06:02.609
<i>and learn about colonial living.</i>

06:03.200 --> 06:05.521
<i>You've been assigned to learning group 38</i>

06:05.600 --> 06:08.729
<i>for passengers with engineering
and technical trade skills.</i>

06:09.000 --> 06:11.526
<i>Please scan your ID
to confirm luggage delivery.</i>

06:13.120 --> 06:14.406
<i>Jim.</i>

06:14.480 --> 06:17.165
<i>Please scan your ID
to confirm luggage delivery.</i>

06:21.720 --> 06:26.328
<i>To help you recover from hibernation,
be sure to drink plenty of fluids.</i>

06:27.960 --> 06:30.566
<i>Enjoy the rest of your
voyage on the</i> Avalon,

06:30.640 --> 06:32.802
<i>a Homestead Company Starship.</i>

06:35.440 --> 06:36.885
<i>Good morning, one and all.</i>

06:37.000 --> 06:39.606
<i>It's a beautiful morning
here on the</i> Starship Avalon.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.411
<i>Whatever you do, don't get homesick,
get Homestead.</i>

06:42.480 --> 06:44.816
<i>Let's start things off
with one of my favorites back on Earth.</i>

06:44.840 --> 06:47.161
<i>Once upon a time
You dressed so fine</i>

06:47.240 --> 06:49.607
<i>Threw the bums a dime in your prime</i>

06:50.240 --> 06:51.571
<i>Didn't you?</i>

06:51.680 --> 06:53.091
No.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.530
That's stupid.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.569
Just own it. Own it, Jim.
You got a cool jacket.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.524
<i>Hello, passengers.</i>

07:21.240 --> 07:23.163
<i>Will you all please take a seat.</i>

07:24.480 --> 07:27.450
<i>Welcome, learning group 38.</i>

07:27.520 --> 07:30.205
<i>Your introduction to colonial life.</i>

07:30.720 --> 07:34.441
<i>Earth is a prosperous planet,
the cradle of civilization.</i>

07:34.880 --> 07:39.681
<i>But for many, it's also overpopulated,
overpriced, overrated.</i>

07:40.360 --> 07:42.442
I'm sorry, I think I may be in the wrong...

07:42.520 --> 07:44.329
<i>Hold all questions till the end, please.</i>

07:44.440 --> 07:45.441
Oh, sorry.

07:45.520 --> 07:48.410
<i>The colonies offer an alternative,
a better way of life.</i>

07:48.480 --> 07:49.641
Where are all the other...

07:49.720 --> 07:53.770
<i>And there's no colony
more beautiful than Homestead II,</i>

07:53.840 --> 07:55.763
<i>the jewel of the occupied world.</i>

07:55.840 --> 07:57.205
I'm sorry.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.486
Where is everybody?

07:58.960 --> 08:01.008
<i>We are all on the</i> Starship Avalon.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.445
But I'm the only one here.

08:02.520 --> 08:06.650
<i>There are 5,000 passengers
and 258 crew members.</i>

08:07.200 --> 08:08.406
So why am I alone?

08:08.920 --> 08:10.763
<i>We're all in this together.</i>

08:12.920 --> 08:13.921
<i>Hello?</i>

08:15.880 --> 08:17.211
Anybody here?

08:17.720 --> 08:19.051
Hello?

08:30.080 --> 08:33.049
<i>Please buckle up
and secure any loose items.</i>

08:33.120 --> 08:36.841
<i>This elevator will experience
a momentary lapse in gravity.</i>

08:59.880 --> 09:01.769
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

09:14.840 --> 09:15.841
<i>Hello.</i>

09:16.800 --> 09:19.007
<i>Welcome to the grand concourse
aboard the</i> Avalon.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.281
<i>Can I help you?</i>

09:21.160 --> 09:23.083
I need to talk to a person.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.810
A real live person, please?

09:24.880 --> 09:27.087
<i>What sort of person?
Personal trainer? Travel planner?</i>

09:27.200 --> 09:28.770
<i>- Therapist?</i>
- I... I don't know.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.245
Somebody in charge.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.129
<i>The ship's steward
handles passenger affairs.</i>

09:32.200 --> 09:34.328
<i>It's on level three of the grand concourse.</i>

09:34.400 --> 09:36.084
- Thank you.
<i>- Happy to help.</i>

09:41.800 --> 09:42.801
Not good.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.816
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Who's flying the ship?

09:44.840 --> 09:46.816
<i>The flight crew, the captain, the pilot,
the chief navigator...</i>

09:46.840 --> 09:48.922
Captain. I want to speak to the captain.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.843
<i>The captain rarely handles
passenger queries...</i>

09:50.920 --> 09:52.684
It's an emergency! Please.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.448
<i>The captain is usually found on
the bridge, in the command ring.</i>

10:06.840 --> 10:09.844
<i>Bridge access requires
special authorization.</i>

10:11.880 --> 10:14.690
<i>Bridge access requires
special authorization.</i>

10:17.720 --> 10:19.961
You got to be kidding me.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.602
<i>Welcome to the observatory.</i>

10:37.560 --> 10:40.040
<i>What can I show you?</i>

10:40.280 --> 10:42.248
We're supposed to land soon.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.890
I'm... I'm the only one awake.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.560
<i>I don't understand. What can I show you?</i>

10:52.240 --> 10:53.651
Show me Homestead II.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.769
<i>Homestead II is the fourth planet
in the Bhakti System.</i>

10:57.120 --> 10:59.327
Right. And where are we?

10:59.400 --> 11:02.404
<i>We're in transit from
Earth to Homestead II.</i>

11:02.560 --> 11:05.325
<i>We will arrive in approximately 90 years.</i>

11:05.400 --> 11:06.400
What?

11:06.440 --> 11:09.842
<i>We arrive at Homestead II
in 90 years, three weeks and one day.</i>

11:09.920 --> 11:11.081
No. Wait.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.764
How long ago did we leave Earth?

11:12.840 --> 11:15.320
<i>Approximately 30 years ago.</i>

11:19.320 --> 11:21.641
I woke up too soon.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.009
<i>Hello.</i>

11:25.120 --> 11:26.690
How do I send a message to Earth?

11:26.760 --> 11:29.161
<i>Interstellar messages are
sent by laser array.</i>

11:29.240 --> 11:30.685
<i>This is an expensive service.</i>

11:30.760 --> 11:32.444
- Bite me.
<i>- Happy to help.</i>

11:35.440 --> 11:36.640
<i>Planet and connection?</i>

11:36.880 --> 11:38.803
Earth. The Homestead Company.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.289
<i>There are 30,826 contacts
listed under Homestead Company.</i>

11:43.920 --> 11:46.924
I'm emigrating to Homestead II
and I have an emergency.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.206
<i>I have a customer help line.</i>

11:48.280 --> 11:49.281
Sounds about right.

11:49.680 --> 11:50.681
<i>Begin message.</i>

11:52.000 --> 11:54.731
Hi. Uh, I'm Jim Preston.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.045
I'm a passenger on the <i>Avalon.</i>

11:57.840 --> 11:59.205
I, uh...

12:02.280 --> 12:05.124
I think something went wrong
with my hibernation pod.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.565
<i>I woke up too soon.</i>

12:06.640 --> 12:10.326
<i>And I mean, way too soon.</i>

12:10.400 --> 12:13.051
<i>Nobody else is awake, and...</i>

12:13.600 --> 12:15.364
<i>I don't know how to get back to sleep.</i>

12:15.440 --> 12:18.569
And the thing is, there's 90 years to go.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.411
At this rate, I'm...

12:27.920 --> 12:30.366
I'm sorry, I'm trying to fix this.

12:30.560 --> 12:33.484
Maybe I missed something.
I could use a hand.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.525
That's all.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.367
Thank you.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.291
<i>Message sent.</i>

12:42.440 --> 12:43.487
Outstanding.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.847
<i>Message will arrive in 19 years.</i>

12:46.000 --> 12:47.047
Wait, what?

12:47.280 --> 12:49.282
<i>Earliest reply in 55 years.</i>

12:49.880 --> 12:51.848
Fifty-five years?

12:52.120 --> 12:54.202
<i>We apologize for the delay.</i>

12:54.360 --> 12:56.806
<i>That will be $6,012.</i>

13:05.440 --> 13:08.410
<i>Call me irresponsible</i>

13:10.960 --> 13:12.644
- Afternoon.
- Oh, man!

13:12.960 --> 13:14.803
Is it good to see another face!

13:15.240 --> 13:16.730
Thought I was the only one awake.

13:16.840 --> 13:19.923
Who wants to sleep
on a beautiful day like this?

13:20.080 --> 13:22.924
No, I mean we're in trouble.
We're not supposed to be here.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.049
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.768
- Huh?
- Our little secret.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.686
What can I get for you?

13:30.880 --> 13:31.881
What?

13:32.080 --> 13:33.445
You look like a whiskey man.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.520
Uh, okay.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.845
Oh, you're a robot.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.767
Android. Technically.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.361
Arthur's the name.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.841
- Jim.
- Pleased to meet you, Jim.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.604
How much do you know about this ship?

14:00.240 --> 14:01.571
I don't know.

14:01.640 --> 14:02.721
I know some things.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.241
What do I do
if my hibernation pod malfunctions?

14:05.320 --> 14:07.800
Oh, hibernation pods are fail-safe.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.211
They never malfunction.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.486
Well, I woke up early.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.001
Can't happen.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.523
How long until we get to Homestead II?

14:14.600 --> 14:16.443
About 90 years or so.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.536
And when are all the passengers
supposed to wake up?

14:18.560 --> 14:20.403
Not till the last four months.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.562
How is it that I'm sitting here with you

14:24.120 --> 14:25.849
with 90 years to go?

14:28.120 --> 14:29.804
Hmm?

14:30.280 --> 14:31.805
It's not possible for you to be here.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.205
Well, I am.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.571
<i>Good morning.
It's a beautiful day here on the</i> Avalon.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.929
<i>So wake up, sunshine.
It's time to relax and enjoy your stay.</i>

14:58.080 --> 14:59.889
<i>Please make a selection.</i>

15:01.720 --> 15:05.850
<i>Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for gold-class passengers.</i>

15:05.920 --> 15:08.491
<i>Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for...</i>

15:08.560 --> 15:10.000
I want the Mocha Cappuccino Extreme.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.087
Bill my room, please.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.730
<i>Food can be purchased in the ship's...</i>

15:12.800 --> 15:14.290
<i>Sorry. The French Roast...</i>

15:14.360 --> 15:15.725
<i>Sorry. The Pumpkin Spice...</i>

15:16.320 --> 15:17.401
<i>Sorry. Vanilla Chai...</i>

15:17.520 --> 15:18.760
<i>Sorry. Sorry.</i>

15:18.840 --> 15:20.888
<i>Sorry.</i>

15:20.960 --> 15:21.961
<i>Large coffee.</i>

15:22.040 --> 15:24.008
- Cream...
<i>- Please enjoy your coffee.</i>

15:24.520 --> 15:25.521
Oh, really?

16:46.840 --> 16:50.526
<i>Crew pod room access
requires special authorization.</i>

17:34.320 --> 17:35.606
<i>Grand...</i>

17:35.680 --> 17:36.681
<i>Going...</i>

17:37.040 --> 17:38.565
<i>Please make... Level...</i>

17:40.520 --> 17:42.204
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

17:42.280 --> 17:43.406
<i>I'm screwed, Arthur.</i>

17:44.240 --> 17:46.083
Completely and ridiculously screwed.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.491
Come on, now.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.608
Every cloud has a silver lining.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.650
Guess I am gonna die of
old age on this ship.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.205
Oh, we all die.

17:56.920 --> 17:59.320
Even androids end up on the scrap heap.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.321
I'm your only customer.
Why are you always polishing a glass?

18:03.440 --> 18:04.930
Trick of the trade.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.651
Makes people nervous
when a bartender just stands there.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.290
So lay some bartender wisdom on me.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.164
I'm lost in space here.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.966
You're not where you want to be.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.566
You feel like you're supposed
to be somewhere else.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.081
You said it.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.929
Well, say you could snap your fingers

18:26.040 --> 18:28.441
and be wherever you wanted to be.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.284
I bet you'd still feel this way.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.085
Not in the right place.

18:32.160 --> 18:35.960
Point is, you can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be

18:36.040 --> 18:38.281
that you forget how to make
the most of where you are.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.405
What are you telling me?

18:40.480 --> 18:43.529
Take a break from worrying
about what you can't control.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.367
Live a little.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.169
Live a little.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.811
<i>Welcome to the Vienna Suite.</i>

19:00.880 --> 19:01.881
Oh.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.570
Oh, yeah.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.564
Huh.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.845
What?

19:14.640 --> 19:15.971
Ah!

19:17.240 --> 19:19.402
<i>- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>
- Yeah!

19:19.480 --> 19:21.005
Make that a double jumbo shrimp.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.401
Triple.

19:24.760 --> 19:25.761
Dance-off.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.525
All right.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.840
I did exactly what you just did.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.803
<i>Large coffee.</i>

19:46.360 --> 19:47.930
<i>You have had many, señor.</i>

19:51.680 --> 19:52.681
<i>Sí, señor.</i>

19:53.280 --> 19:54.281
<i>Gracias.</i>

19:55.440 --> 19:56.646
<i>Come on, come on</i>

19:56.720 --> 19:59.291
<i>Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>

20:01.920 --> 20:04.651
<i>A little less conversation
A little more action, please</i>

20:06.680 --> 20:08.489
Get out of here!

20:10.120 --> 20:11.360
Come back. Hey.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.127
Come here.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.410
<i>Welcome, Jim.</i>

21:13.840 --> 21:15.171
<i>Please turn your attention</i>

21:15.240 --> 21:18.483
<i>to the screens displaying safety tips.</i>

21:18.560 --> 21:22.849
<i>These spacesuits are designed to withstand
the harsh environment of space.</i>

21:22.920 --> 21:25.127
<i>The carbon fiber and polyamide construction</i>

21:25.200 --> 21:28.568
<i>means your suit is both
flexible and durable.</i>

21:41.000 --> 21:43.731
<i>Remember,
your spacesuit is your lifeline.</i>

21:52.920 --> 21:56.720
<i>Slide the handle on the right
to release the air pressure.</i>

21:58.080 --> 22:00.367
<i>Your magnetic boots are now engaged.</i>

22:00.440 --> 22:02.800
<i>They can be deactivated
using the control panel on your arm.</i>

22:03.800 --> 22:06.326
<i>Press the red button
to open the airlock door.</i>

22:10.320 --> 22:12.084
<i>Have a wonderful time.</i>

22:19.600 --> 22:20.647
<i>Tether attached.</i>

23:49.160 --> 23:50.685
<i>Welcome back, Jim.</i>

23:54.320 --> 23:56.482
<i>We hope you decide to join us again soon</i>

23:56.560 --> 23:58.927
<i>for another thrilling experience.</i>

24:22.920 --> 24:24.843
<i>Have a wonderful time.</i>

25:45.480 --> 25:47.050
Aurora.

25:48.760 --> 25:50.842
<i>Searching passenger profiles.</i>

25:51.120 --> 25:52.884
<i>I'm Aurora Lane.</i>

25:52.960 --> 25:55.930
<i>Passenger 1456. I'm a writer.</i>

25:56.240 --> 25:57.730
<i>I think we tell each other stories</i>

25:57.800 --> 26:00.485
<i>to know we're not alone, to make contact.</i>

26:00.800 --> 26:04.088
<i>Your father was Oliver Lane,
a Pulitzer Prize-winning author.</i>

26:04.160 --> 26:05.446
<i>No pressure, right?</i>

26:05.520 --> 26:08.922
<i>My dad used to say,
"If you live an ordinary life,</i>

26:09.000 --> 26:11.287
<i>"all you'll have are ordinary stories.</i>

26:11.360 --> 26:13.522
<i>"You have to live a life of adventure."</i>

26:14.880 --> 26:16.564
<i>So...</i>

26:16.640 --> 26:17.721
<i>Here I am.</i>

26:24.760 --> 26:26.330
Good morning.

26:28.840 --> 26:31.810
<i>We're starting over in every way.</i>

26:32.480 --> 26:35.051
<i>I'll have to figure out
where to live, how to live,</i>

26:35.120 --> 26:36.645
<i>Who my friends will be.</i>

26:36.720 --> 26:38.056
<i>It's like the first day of school.</i>

26:38.080 --> 26:40.320
<i>If the school bus took 120
years to get there.</i>

26:43.440 --> 26:45.283
<i>We're creating a culture...</i>

26:45.440 --> 26:46.487
You are funny.

26:46.560 --> 26:49.291
Do you ever read something
and feel like it's written just for you?

26:50.040 --> 26:51.883
I don't do a lot of reading.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.724
She's good.

26:54.640 --> 26:55.971
Who's that?

26:56.040 --> 26:58.168
- Aurora.
- Ah...

26:58.960 --> 27:00.086
The sleeping girl.

27:05.160 --> 27:07.208
You know, I'm not saying
the universe is evil,

27:07.280 --> 27:09.089
but it sure has a nasty sense of humor.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.161
How is that?

27:10.240 --> 27:12.766
You get to fly to another planet,

27:12.840 --> 27:15.320
but you'll die along the way.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.880
And you find the perfect woman

27:20.240 --> 27:21.969
right in front of you...

27:23.160 --> 27:24.924
Yet she's completely out of reach.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.244
<i>Yeah, I'll miss New York City.</i>

27:30.800 --> 27:32.936
<i>Give me a cup of coffee
and a view of the Chrysler Building,</i>

27:32.960 --> 27:34.200
<i>and I can write all day.</i>

27:34.640 --> 27:36.776
<i>They do have coffee on Homestead II, right?</i>

27:36.800 --> 27:37.847
<i>They better have coffee.</i>

27:37.920 --> 27:40.287
<i>If they don't, I have to turn around
and come back to Earth.</i>

27:41.480 --> 27:43.528
<i>Is there anything
you regret leaving behind?</i>

27:45.040 --> 27:48.283
<i>Yeah, I'll miss the trees
in Central Park turning in the fall.</i>

27:49.600 --> 27:51.125
<i>I'll also miss crowds...</i>

28:00.840 --> 28:02.604
Say you were trapped on a desert island,

28:03.280 --> 28:05.931
and you had the power
to wish somebody there with you.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.809
You wouldn't be alone anymore.

28:08.760 --> 28:10.922
But you'd be stranding the person
on the island.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.441
How do... Would you make that wish?

28:13.520 --> 28:15.887
I don't know. I've never been on an island.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.610
Okay, well, yeah.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.610
Uh... Forget the island.

28:21.120 --> 28:25.125
Let's say you figured out
how to do something

28:25.800 --> 28:27.496
that would make your life
a million times better,

28:27.520 --> 28:30.126
but you knew it was wrong
and there's no taking it back.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.281
How do you do the math?

28:31.680 --> 28:33.728
Jim, these are not robot questions.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.725
I know how to wake Aurora up.

28:41.800 --> 28:44.531
Oh. Well, that seems like a fine idea.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.681
You could use some company.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.486
I'd be stranding her on this ship
for the rest of her life.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.767
Oh. Well, you can't do that.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.526
What am I gonna do?

28:53.640 --> 28:55.085
I'm here for you.

28:55.160 --> 28:56.969
Arthur, you're a machine.

29:01.320 --> 29:04.324
See? You can't feel that.
You don't have feelings.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.361
See?

29:08.440 --> 29:10.124
That doesn't hurt.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.202
And you don't even mind.

29:12.640 --> 29:15.325
'Cause you're not a person.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.441
Don't even think about it.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.931
No more Aurora talk.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.445
I'm over it.

29:26.960 --> 29:27.961
I'm moving on.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.129
Don't even think about it!

29:31.200 --> 29:33.136
What am I gonna do?
I'm just gonna sit and think about it?

29:33.160 --> 29:34.696
I'm not... I can't think about it,
so I'm not going to.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.563
That's the deal. I've made my decision.

29:36.640 --> 29:37.641
I know what I'm doing.

29:38.160 --> 29:39.520
I just cut it off.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.096
I'm not... No more.

29:43.120 --> 29:44.736
You won't hear me bring up her name again.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.320
I'll never even mention her name again.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.481
Done.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.204
You can't do it.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.805
Shaving off my beard.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.563
Please don't do it.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.445
<i>Good morning, Aurora.</i>

32:05.520 --> 32:07.682
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

32:07.760 --> 32:10.570
<i>It's perfectly normal to feel confused.</i>

32:10.680 --> 32:13.763
<i>You just spent 120 years
in suspended animation.</i>

33:02.160 --> 33:04.208
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

33:04.280 --> 33:05.725
Hello?

33:09.240 --> 33:10.480
Anybody?

33:19.360 --> 33:20.361
Hello.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.241
Hi.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.409
Are you passenger or crew?

33:32.600 --> 33:34.284
Passenger.

33:34.360 --> 33:35.521
Jim Preston.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.250
Aurora Lane.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.449
Do you know what's going on?

33:40.520 --> 33:42.443
Nobody else from my row woke up.

33:43.760 --> 33:44.841
Same for me.

33:44.960 --> 33:47.645
The crew's supposed to wake up
a month before we do,

33:47.720 --> 33:49.484
but I haven't seen anybody.

33:53.400 --> 33:54.890
The crew is still asleep.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.689
Are you saying nobody's awake?

33:59.400 --> 34:00.447
Just me.

34:00.880 --> 34:01.961
Just you?

34:02.120 --> 34:03.406
It's just us.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.767
But somebody's got to land the ship
in a few weeks.

34:07.600 --> 34:10.888
<i>We will arrive in approximately 89 years.</i>

34:11.120 --> 34:13.121
Eighty-nine years?

34:15.440 --> 34:18.284
The other passengers aren't late waking up.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.444
We were early.

34:26.040 --> 34:28.327
We... We need help.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.639
Where's the crew?

34:30.280 --> 34:32.965
The crew's in a secure
hibernation room.

34:33.040 --> 34:36.328
Everything important, the controls,
the reactors, the engines...

34:36.400 --> 34:38.004
It's all behind firewalls.

34:38.080 --> 34:39.764
There's no way through.

34:50.199 --> 34:52.487
How long have you been awake?

34:53.159 --> 34:54.889
A year and three weeks.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.371
No. No, no, no.

34:59.200 --> 35:00.645
No, this can't be happening.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.209
We have to go back to sleep.

35:03.880 --> 35:05.211
Aurora, we can't.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.368
We just have to get back to our pods
and start them up again.

35:12.640 --> 35:15.291
I can't find my pod.
I can't find my pod.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.601
I can't find my pod. I don't know which...

35:17.680 --> 35:19.170
It doesn't matter.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.810
- Aurora...
- I can't find it!

35:21.880 --> 35:23.696
- Stop. Aurora...
- I can't find which one is mine!

35:23.720 --> 35:25.370
- Stop.
- I don't know which one is mine!

35:25.440 --> 35:26.560
- I'll help you.
- I can't...

35:26.600 --> 35:29.126
Stop! It doesn't matter.

35:31.760 --> 35:35.082
Putting somebody into hibernation
requires special equipment.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.643
Remember the facility
where they put us under,

35:37.720 --> 35:40.087
all the procedures we went through?

35:40.240 --> 35:42.447
These pods are designed
to keep us in hibernation,

35:42.520 --> 35:44.045
to wake us up at the right time,

35:44.160 --> 35:45.764
but they can't put us back to sleep.

35:45.960 --> 35:48.725
You don't think there's a way
back into hibernation?

35:50.240 --> 35:51.605
No.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.250
But there has to be.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.525
There has to be.

36:04.400 --> 36:07.165
9:00. Nighttime.

36:12.080 --> 36:15.084
I know I should be
working the problem, but...

36:15.760 --> 36:17.524
I can't even keep my eyes open.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.483
You just came out of hibernation.

36:20.560 --> 36:23.006
It's going to be a couple of days
before you're 100%.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.525
You should get some rest.

36:25.720 --> 36:27.324
Think I'm gonna have to.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.011
I'll walk you to your cabin.

36:30.080 --> 36:32.606
No, it's okay. I'll be all right.

36:33.480 --> 36:34.481
Okay.

36:38.360 --> 36:39.407
Good night, Aurora.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.243
More than a year?

36:43.320 --> 36:45.129
I can't imagine.

36:45.920 --> 36:47.365
It must have been so hard for you.

36:48.560 --> 36:49.925
It was.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.445
Good night, Jim.

36:53.280 --> 36:56.329
<i>Please buckle up and secure
any loose items.</i>

36:59.720 --> 37:01.961
- Whiskey, neat.
- Sure thing.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.126
How's your day been?

37:10.960 --> 37:12.121
Aurora's awake.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.004
Congratulations.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.765
You don't look happy.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.610
Arthur, can you keep a secret?

37:23.720 --> 37:25.210
Jim...

37:25.280 --> 37:27.851
I'm not just a bartender, I'm a gentleman.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.801
Don't tell Aurora that I woke her up.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.600
She thinks it was an accident.
Let me tell her.

37:35.840 --> 37:37.251
Of course.

37:50.840 --> 37:53.176
How can there be no way
to put someone back into hibernation?

37:53.200 --> 37:54.611
What if a pod breaks down?

37:54.680 --> 37:56.444
<i>No hibernation pod has malfunctioned</i>

37:56.520 --> 37:58.807
<i>in thousands of interstellar flights.</i>

37:59.480 --> 38:02.051
Well, I'm awake.

38:02.120 --> 38:04.407
<i>Hibernation pods are fail-safe.</i>

38:05.040 --> 38:06.280
Good morning.

38:06.360 --> 38:09.284
- Have you eaten?
- No. I'm starving.

38:09.360 --> 38:11.681
And this is the dumbest machine.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.325
<i>Happy to help.</i>

38:25.440 --> 38:28.046
<i>Gold-class breakfast.</i>

38:38.600 --> 38:40.204
Well, you're a man of simple tastes.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.962
I'm not a gold-class passenger.

38:45.280 --> 38:47.408
French breakfast puffs above my pay grade.

38:47.480 --> 38:48.970
What? This whole time?

38:49.040 --> 38:50.804
- Yeah.
- What can I get you?

38:50.880 --> 38:52.848
- No. No, I'm fine.
- Stop it.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.729
Really. Okay.

38:56.440 --> 38:57.771
Here you go.

39:02.680 --> 39:03.681
Yeah.

39:04.320 --> 39:07.483
So, I was thinking,
maybe there's another way to go to sleep.

39:07.560 --> 39:08.766
What about the infirmary?

39:08.840 --> 39:11.241
I checked it out.
It's just scanners and an Autodoc.

39:11.320 --> 39:13.766
There could be another hibernation machine
in the cargo hold.

39:13.840 --> 39:14.966
I had that thought, too.

39:15.240 --> 39:16.376
And then I read the manifest.

39:16.400 --> 39:18.448
It's mostly farming stuff,
machines and trade goods.

39:18.960 --> 39:21.167
Replacement parts
for computers and engineering.

39:21.240 --> 39:23.607
We're not gonna find
a hibernation facility in a box.

39:23.680 --> 39:25.409
- We could build our own.
- We can't.

39:25.480 --> 39:26.600
Jim, you're not even trying.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.961
I have tried everything.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.044
For over a year, I...

39:32.280 --> 39:33.406
I tried everything.

39:33.480 --> 39:34.925
Well...

39:36.560 --> 39:38.085
Well, I'm not ready to give up.

39:47.480 --> 39:49.244
<i>Infirmary.</i>

39:57.040 --> 39:59.805
What about research articles?
Any kind of technical documents.

39:59.880 --> 40:02.486
<i>Hibernation technology is proprietary.</i>

40:02.560 --> 40:06.281
<i>The following articles deal with the
subject on a theoretical level.</i>

40:49.520 --> 40:51.887
New file. My voyage.

40:53.040 --> 40:56.726
I boarded the <i>Avalon</i> with an idea,
a destination.

40:57.520 --> 41:00.888
Both now out of reach.

41:03.320 --> 41:04.890
<i>I've been awake for seven days.</i>

41:05.840 --> 41:07.968
<i>Awake far too soon.</i>

41:08.280 --> 41:10.567
And I may well spend the
rest of my life here,

41:11.360 --> 41:15.160
<i>in a steel world 1,000 meters long.</i>

41:16.560 --> 41:20.929
<i>There's another passenger awake,
a mechanic named Jim Preston.</i>

41:23.080 --> 41:25.731
He seems to have accepted our fate.

41:26.560 --> 41:28.403
<i>But I'm scared.</i>

41:29.360 --> 41:31.010
<i>I'm fighting to stay calm.</i>

41:33.920 --> 41:36.241
<i>All the other passengers will sleep</i>

41:36.320 --> 41:38.322
<i>for another 90 years</i>

41:39.720 --> 41:42.166
<i>while I live out my life on this ship,</i>

41:42.920 --> 41:44.649
<i>traveling forever...</i>

41:45.640 --> 41:47.483
<i>Never arriving...</i>

41:48.440 --> 41:50.807
<i>My only companion a total stranger.</i>

41:59.960 --> 42:01.121
Why did you do it?

42:03.760 --> 42:04.841
Do what?

42:06.480 --> 42:08.960
Emigrate. Leave Earth.

42:09.960 --> 42:11.576
I'm interviewing you.

42:11.600 --> 42:12.601
You're what?

42:12.840 --> 42:16.287
You were the first hibernation failure
in the history of space travel.

42:16.360 --> 42:17.441
That makes you a story.

42:18.520 --> 42:19.851
Who you gonna tell?

42:19.920 --> 42:21.081
Posterity.

42:21.160 --> 42:23.970
So, why did you give up your life on Earth?

42:24.520 --> 42:28.366
120-year space hibernation means
you'll never see your family or friends again.

42:28.880 --> 42:32.771
You'll wake up in a new century
on a new planet.

42:32.840 --> 42:34.569
It's the ultimate geographical suicide.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.407
Well, I could ask you the same thing.

42:37.480 --> 42:39.323
But it's my interview.

42:39.680 --> 42:41.603
Were you running away from something?

42:41.760 --> 42:43.330
No.

42:43.400 --> 42:45.721
- Everything was okay.
- So?

42:45.800 --> 42:47.296
Well, I guess I just wanted a new world,

42:47.320 --> 42:48.481
I don't know, a fresh start.

42:48.640 --> 42:50.563
That's Homestead Company advertising.

42:50.640 --> 42:52.051
- Is it?
- Jim.

42:52.200 --> 42:54.009
I... I know. I guess. You're right.

42:59.520 --> 43:02.330
Back on Earth, when something breaks,
you don't fix it, you replace it.

43:03.200 --> 43:05.931
The colonies, they have problems to solve.

43:06.160 --> 43:07.844
They're my kind of problems.

43:09.560 --> 43:11.642
And a mechanic is somebody.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.927
This is a new world still being built.

43:16.080 --> 43:18.321
I could build a house and live in it.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.851
Open country. Room to grow.

43:26.160 --> 43:27.400
Now you're back to slogans.

43:27.800 --> 43:29.245
Can't slogans be true?

43:31.160 --> 43:32.536
<i>Do you know how much
Homestead Company</i>

43:32.560 --> 43:34.642
made off its first planet?

43:34.720 --> 43:36.802
Eight quadrillion dollars.

43:36.880 --> 43:39.611
That's eight million billions.

43:39.720 --> 43:42.087
Colony planets
are the biggest business going.

43:42.520 --> 43:44.204
Did you pay full price for your ticket?

43:44.360 --> 43:46.647
No. I'm in a desirable trade.

43:46.720 --> 43:51.282
So they fill your head with dreams,
discount your ticket,

43:51.360 --> 43:53.249
and you fly off to populate their planet

43:53.320 --> 43:55.448
and give Homestead
20% of everything that you make

43:55.520 --> 43:56.560
for the rest of your life.

43:56.600 --> 43:59.729
Not to mention the debt you run up
on this fancy starship.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.882
So all you see here is 5,000 suckers?

44:03.000 --> 44:06.402
I see zeros
on the Homestead Company's bottom line.

44:06.800 --> 44:09.770
I see 5,000 men and women
changing their lives.

44:10.680 --> 44:13.365
For 5,000 different reasons.
You don't know these people.

44:13.480 --> 44:16.131
I'm a journalist. I know people.

44:17.800 --> 44:18.801
Really?

44:19.560 --> 44:20.561
This one.

44:21.040 --> 44:23.520
Is he a banker, a teacher or a gardener?

44:25.160 --> 44:26.924
- Banker.
- He's a gardener.

44:28.600 --> 44:31.126
And her. Is she a...

44:31.400 --> 44:33.971
Madison, Donna or a Lola?

44:35.360 --> 44:37.362
Donna's too serious for that hair.

44:37.440 --> 44:38.441
Lola.

44:39.360 --> 44:41.328
- Madison.
- Shit!

44:43.680 --> 44:46.524
All right, chef, accountant or midwife?

44:46.760 --> 44:47.807
She has to be a midwife.

44:47.880 --> 44:49.496
There's no way you just made that one up.

44:49.520 --> 44:50.567
Yeah. She's a midwife.

44:52.280 --> 44:54.442
I didn't know they still had midwives.

44:56.560 --> 44:59.086
I like her. We'd be friends.

44:59.640 --> 45:01.404
You think you can see that?

45:01.480 --> 45:02.891
Don't you?

45:05.080 --> 45:06.241
I do.

45:06.440 --> 45:08.886
- A round-trip ticket?
- That's right.

45:09.040 --> 45:11.361
I was gonna fly to Homestead II,
live for a year,

45:11.440 --> 45:12.771
and then right back to Earth.

45:13.120 --> 45:16.488
I don't get it. I left Earth for a new life,
but you end up back where you started?

45:16.560 --> 45:18.210
I end up in the future.

45:18.280 --> 45:20.487
Two hundred and fifty years in the future,

45:20.560 --> 45:23.325
on Earth, which is still
the center of civilization,

45:23.400 --> 45:24.640
like it or not.

45:25.560 --> 45:28.962
And I'll be the only writer to ever travel
to a colony world and come back.

45:29.080 --> 45:30.969
I'll have a story no one else can tell.

45:31.080 --> 45:32.570
What story?

45:32.640 --> 45:34.961
Humanity's flight to the stars.

45:35.040 --> 45:37.008
The greatest migration in human history.

45:37.080 --> 45:38.730
It's the biggest story there is.

45:38.880 --> 45:41.056
But you won't know
any of the people who are reading it.

45:41.080 --> 45:42.570
But they'd be reading it.

45:44.800 --> 45:46.325
Or they would have been.

45:48.040 --> 45:49.326
I'll never write it now.

45:49.840 --> 45:51.490
I don't know if I'll ever write again.

45:54.160 --> 45:56.970
Jim, I can't think of anything else to try

45:57.880 --> 45:59.450
to save us.

46:01.440 --> 46:03.841
And I don't even want to
think about it anymore.

46:06.320 --> 46:07.685
What is there to do around here?

46:10.720 --> 46:12.927
- Are you serious?
- Dead serious.

46:13.040 --> 46:15.964
- Partner mode.
<i>- Let's get it on!</i>

46:16.040 --> 46:18.486
Come on, get in power mode.

46:25.160 --> 46:26.730
You just stand here.

46:26.800 --> 46:28.211
And then we repeat what they do.

46:36.240 --> 46:38.527
Uh, is there anything else we can do?

46:38.600 --> 46:39.806
- Just do the...
- Okay.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.256
- You don't have to.
- Okay. I can...

46:41.280 --> 46:43.123
<i>- Beat down!</i>
- Hey!

46:44.000 --> 46:45.445
Here we go. Let's see it. Oh!

46:45.960 --> 46:47.450
Whoa! Whoa! Oh.

46:47.520 --> 46:48.896
Oh!

46:48.920 --> 46:50.843
- Why you smiling?
<i>- Aurora! Aurora!</i>

46:50.920 --> 46:52.570
'Cause I'm up two points.

46:53.080 --> 46:54.320
Who's the lovely lady?

46:54.440 --> 46:55.646
This is Aurora.

46:55.880 --> 46:58.121
Aurora. A pleasure.

47:00.760 --> 47:02.364
- I can't!
- You did great!

47:02.720 --> 47:04.640
Okay, one more time.
One more time, let's see it.

47:10.360 --> 47:11.885
Oh!

47:16.720 --> 47:17.721
- Yes!
- Whoo!

47:21.080 --> 47:22.920
I swear, I didn't
wear pants for a month.

47:23.080 --> 47:25.606
Seven weeks and two days, to be exact.

47:25.680 --> 47:26.920
The man has no shame.

47:27.120 --> 47:29.480
Well, you're a little lacking
in that area yourself, Arthur.

47:32.960 --> 47:34.485
I laughed at the man with no pants

47:34.560 --> 47:36.688
until I realized I have no legs.

47:43.200 --> 47:45.601
For a minute,
I almost forgot my life is in ruins.

47:46.040 --> 47:47.246
I'm sorry.

47:47.960 --> 47:49.405
What for?

47:50.800 --> 47:52.290
I'm gonna go to bed.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.121
Good night.

47:54.200 --> 47:55.804
- All right.
- Good night, Aurora.

47:59.400 --> 48:00.925
She is wonderful.

48:02.600 --> 48:04.125
Excellent choice.

49:31.600 --> 49:32.601
Hello.

49:33.400 --> 49:34.401
<i>Hi.</i>

49:35.040 --> 49:36.041
Here you go.

49:42.440 --> 49:44.249
<i>Is he asking me on a date?</i>

49:45.600 --> 49:48.206
Do you need a pen?

50:00.840 --> 50:02.604
She didn't seem that impressed.

50:20.760 --> 50:22.888
"Love to." She wrote, "Love to."

50:30.960 --> 50:32.530
<i>You have a visitor.</i>

50:51.120 --> 50:52.406
Wow.

50:52.680 --> 50:54.603
You clean up pretty good yourself.

50:55.320 --> 50:56.367
You went shopping.

50:56.480 --> 50:58.801
I went shoplifting.

51:03.200 --> 51:04.247
Evening.

51:04.520 --> 51:05.806
What can I get for you?

51:05.880 --> 51:07.882
I'll have a Manhattan, please.

51:09.280 --> 51:11.169
- Whiskey, rocks.
- Coming up.

51:19.560 --> 51:21.050
You two look fine this evening.

51:21.400 --> 51:23.926
Thank you, Arthur. We're on a date.

51:24.480 --> 51:25.811
Very nice.

51:26.600 --> 51:28.364
Took you long enough to ask.

51:28.760 --> 51:30.171
I was giving you space.

51:31.920 --> 51:33.160
Space.

51:33.240 --> 51:35.561
The one thing I do not need more of.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.365
That was so good.

51:43.480 --> 51:44.960
It wasn't easy getting a reservation.

51:45.440 --> 51:47.761
They're probably gonna want us
to give up our table.

51:47.840 --> 51:49.176
- Mmm-hmm.
- I'm getting a lot of dirty looks.

51:49.200 --> 51:51.080
Very popular tonight.

51:52.800 --> 51:54.245
So how's your book coming?

51:54.480 --> 51:56.448
I don't really know what it is yet.

51:57.600 --> 51:59.602
My dad, he used to always
write about his life,

51:59.720 --> 52:01.290
but he had stories.

52:01.360 --> 52:04.204
He'd sailed around Antarctica.

52:05.200 --> 52:06.440
He was a war reporter.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.767
He had lovers.

52:09.280 --> 52:10.520
He wrote about his daughter.

52:11.320 --> 52:12.320
He wrote about you?

52:12.360 --> 52:14.966
Yeah. I grew up reading
about myself in his books.

52:15.040 --> 52:16.041
How was that?

52:17.560 --> 52:18.607
Not always easy.

52:18.920 --> 52:21.400
A little more than you wanted
to know about yourself.

52:21.920 --> 52:24.651
And then, when I was 17,

52:25.400 --> 52:26.970
he had a heart attack.

52:28.400 --> 52:29.925
Right at his keypad.

52:30.840 --> 52:32.330
End of story.

52:35.400 --> 52:37.846
That was so serious. I'm sorry.

52:38.600 --> 52:39.806
We need more wine.

52:39.880 --> 52:41.405
I like hearing about your life.

52:42.920 --> 52:44.410
Thanks.

52:46.760 --> 52:48.171
Why are we here?

52:48.240 --> 52:49.366
You'll see.

52:51.480 --> 52:53.050
Best show in town.

52:57.440 --> 52:58.930
So you've done this before?

52:59.040 --> 53:00.280
Oh, yeah.

53:00.520 --> 53:01.760
And it's safe?

53:02.040 --> 53:04.008
No.

53:04.560 --> 53:05.846
Reasonably safe.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.682
Hop in. You're next.

53:11.280 --> 53:12.281
What about my dress?

53:15.560 --> 53:16.561
Right.

53:19.640 --> 53:21.165
Turn around.

53:52.040 --> 53:53.451
<i>Tether attached.</i>

54:34.440 --> 54:36.044
<i>What are you doing?</i>

54:36.120 --> 54:37.201
<i>Do you trust me?</i>

55:24.720 --> 55:26.245
<i>Thank you.</i>

56:15.280 --> 56:17.487
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

56:21.120 --> 56:23.168
You kill me.

57:05.520 --> 57:07.522
You okay?

57:07.600 --> 57:09.011
Yeah.

57:10.720 --> 57:12.449
I'm fine.

57:12.520 --> 57:14.010
It's just...

57:21.560 --> 57:23.164
Yeah, I know.

57:38.880 --> 57:41.565
<i>So, I'm seeing someone.</i>

57:41.640 --> 57:43.290
<i>You'll never guess who.</i>

57:44.800 --> 57:47.963
<i>We're the last two people in the world
who would ever get together.</i>

57:48.720 --> 57:50.324
<i>But here we are.</i>

57:50.400 --> 57:51.811
<i>The last two people in the world.</i>

57:52.320 --> 57:53.321
What's that?

57:53.400 --> 57:54.845
I'm writing, Arthur. Hush.

57:56.200 --> 57:59.204
<i>Jim and I live
in accidental happiness.</i>

57:59.280 --> 58:02.250
<i>Like castaways,
making their home on strange shores.</i>

58:02.320 --> 58:04.482
"Strange shores." I love it.

58:04.560 --> 58:05.856
You do? You don't have to say that.

58:05.880 --> 58:08.008
- I know.
- You're not gonna eat this.

58:10.520 --> 58:11.851
Does that seem fishy to you?

58:13.920 --> 58:14.967
Keep reading.

58:15.800 --> 58:17.245
<i>It's funny.</i>

58:17.320 --> 58:18.924
<i>We all have dreams.</i>

58:20.040 --> 58:23.123
<i>We plan our futures
like we're the captains of our fates.</i>

58:24.000 --> 58:25.570
<i>But we're passengers.</i>

58:25.640 --> 58:27.608
<i>We go where fate takes us.</i>

58:27.720 --> 58:30.041
<i>I can't</i>

58:30.200 --> 58:31.200
<i>Help</i>

58:31.240 --> 58:32.241
Arthur!

58:32.360 --> 58:33.920
<i>This isn't the life we planned.</i>

58:34.440 --> 58:36.010
<i>But it's ours.</i>

58:36.080 --> 58:38.651
<i>And for the first time in my life,</i>

58:38.720 --> 58:40.404
<i>I don't feel alone.</i>

58:43.280 --> 58:45.362
<i>We weren't supposed to find each other.</i>

58:46.960 --> 58:48.405
<i>But we did.</i>

58:49.360 --> 58:52.170
<i>He makes me feel like my life isn't over.</i>

58:52.480 --> 58:54.448
<i>Like it's just beginning.</i>

58:55.280 --> 58:56.361
How was your day?

58:56.440 --> 58:58.442
Good. I wrote a few pages.

58:58.840 --> 59:00.763
Did you find anything that can help us?

59:04.600 --> 59:06.204
- I did.
- Are they real?

59:06.960 --> 59:08.610
I cut them myself.

59:08.680 --> 59:10.011
Oh, wow!

59:12.280 --> 59:13.600
You know, for two unlucky people,

59:13.640 --> 59:15.051
we sure got pretty lucky.

59:20.600 --> 59:22.045
<i>Attention.</i>

59:22.160 --> 59:25.801
<i>You may wish to proceed to a viewing area.</i>

59:25.880 --> 59:29.248
<i>The Avalon will slingshot
around the star Arcturus.</i>

59:29.320 --> 59:30.765
Look!

59:30.840 --> 59:32.683
Oh, my God!

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.844
That was amazing.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.364
A red giant.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.008
The universe's present to you.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.851
What?

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.969
Happy birthday.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:36.330
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:40.325
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.450
<i>Happy birthday, dear Aurora</i>

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:48.885
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.881
A birthday drink
for the birthday girl.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.216
Aren't you going to ask for my ID?

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.416
I might not be old enough to drink.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.920
Oh, I would never ask your age
in front of a gentleman.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.850
Jim's no gentleman.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.400
Anyway, there's no secrets
between me and Jim.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.325
- Is that so?
- You heard the lady.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.447
I will be right back.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.411
This is a perfect birthday drink.
Thank you.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.609
I remember this day a year ago.

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.728
Jim was so looking forward to meeting you.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.921
What?

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.649
How could he be looking forward to it?

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.405
Oh, he spent months deciding
whether to wake you up.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.806
He couldn't stop talking about you.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.690
Jim woke me up?

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.851
Oh, yes.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.484
He said it was the hardest
decision of his life.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.126
But I see it worked out just fine.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.771
What?

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.323
Did you wake me up?

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.121
Yes, I woke you up.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.126
How...

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.046
How could you do it?

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.685
I tried not to.

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.805
I'm gonna be sick.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.525
I can't see.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.686
Aurora, please...

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.240
Stay away from me!

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.444
I can't get off this ship.

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:00.000
I can't get off this ship. I can't get off.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.801
No!

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.287
Oh, God.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.490
Can I talk to you?

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.804
<i>Aurora,</i>

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.163
<i>I know nothing I can say
will make this okay.</i>

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.971
<i>But please listen.</i>

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.881
I was so alone

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.530
for so long.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.320
It felt like I was disappearing.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:05.124
The night I first saw you,
I was ready to...

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.721
You saved my life.

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:16.089
<i>And I know that's no excuse for what I did.</i>

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.044
I read everything you wrote,

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.883
<i>and I fell in love with your voice</i>

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.010
<i>and with the way your mind works.</i>

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.561
<i>I fell in love with you.</i>

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.728
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.890
it was like I... I wasn't trapped anymore.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.163
My pointless life suddenly had meaning.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.682
And I wish I could take it back.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.730
<i>But I can't.</i>

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.725
<i>Aurora, I don't want to lose you.</i>

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.928
I don't care!

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:54.208
I don't care what you want!

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:57.126
<i>I don't care why you woke me up!</i>

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.285
You took my life!

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.884
<i>Please stand by.</i>

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.930
<i>Your suite's control center is rebooting.</i>

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.044
I envy you, Arthur.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.761
How so?

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.004
You have a purpose.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:12.681
You're always happy.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.729
How's your book coming along?

01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:18.209
I've never written about myself before.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.776
I think it's some of the best work
I've ever done,

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.768
and I don't even know why I'm doing it.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.844
There's only one person who could read it,
and I can't stand him.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.568
They say time heals all wounds.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.006
Broken hearts aren't that simple, Arthur.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.251
You wouldn't understand.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.569
Arthur!

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.724
Tuesday's my day with Arthur.

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.206
It's Wednesday.

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:00.481
The bar's all yours.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.245
What'll you have? Whiskey?

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.404
Coffee.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:16.091
<i>Aurora! We love you!</i>

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.279
<i>What are we gonna do without you?
We'll miss you so...</i>

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.444
<i>You're the bravest woman I know.</i>

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.930
<i>Bye, Aurora!</i>

01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:28.001
<i>I promise that I will
think of you every day.</i>

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.207
<i>When you wake up, I'll be gone,</i>

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:33.807
<i>but just know that I will never forget you.</i>

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.529
<i>You're my best friend.</i>

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.444
<i>You were never happy here. I know.</i>

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.648
<i>Nothing was ever enough for you.</i>

01:09:43.319 --> 01:09:45.287
<i>You know, you don't have to go.</i>

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:48.569
<i>You could do
whatever it is you have to do right here.</i>

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:51.281
<i>But, uh...</i>

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.049
<i>Since you're going, here's my wish.</i>

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:01.609
<i>I hope you finally find someone
who fills your heart, and</i>

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:04.248
<i>I hope you let him in.</i>

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.685
<i>I hope you realize you don't have to do
something amazing to be happy.</i>

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.766
<i>You know, have fun,</i>

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.244
<i>take chances.</i>

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.923
<i>Um, okay.</i>

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.805
<i>I love you, Aurora.</i>

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.846
<i>Bye.</i>

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.603
Morning, Arthur!

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.603
- Coffee, please.
- Coming up.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.608
Are you soiling my barstool?

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.127
You want to make things,
you got to get your hands dirty.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.200
And what have you been making?

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.051
Improvements.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.042
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.486
<i>First floor.</i>

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.489
<i>Gold-class breakfast.</i>

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:52.644
<i>This is Deck Chief Gus Mancuso.</i>

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:56.284
<i>Who the hell planted a tree on my ship?</i>

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.643
- Who did that?
- I did.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.241
Who are you?

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.601
Jim Preston.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.241
Aurora Lane.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.366
Anybody else awake?

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.965
Just me and him.

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.130
How far along are we?

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.160
Eighty-eight years to go.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.763
Hibernation failure.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.689
They said that couldn't happen.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:50.003
Three people, three pod failures.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.965
You have no idea
how long I've been trying to get in there.

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.361
Now that you're in, don't touch anything.

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.970
This is where you work?

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.281
No, this is flight crew. I'm a deck chief.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.481
Hmm.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.728
Ops, Navigation, Comm.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.721
Hmm.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.929
<i>Unauthorized personnel.</i>

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:14.647
Sorry.

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.363
If I'm reading this right,
we're still on course.

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:23.171
So whatever's wrong with the ship,
NavCom is still on the job.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.736
There's something wrong with the ship?

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.206
Three pod failures?
Yeah, there's something wrong.

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.044
Question is what.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.250
That's strange.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.960
We should be getting diagnostics
from all over the ship right here,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.843
but there's no data.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.364
Got to check all the systems manually.

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.602
Can't we turn the ship around,
go back to Earth?

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.056
No, we're doing 50% of light speed.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.401
Turning back would
take just as much time as going on.

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.240
Well, there's got to be
something we can do.

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.687
Sorry. We're going where we're going.

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.241
You okay?

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.289
Hibernation hangover.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.010
Get it all the time.

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.169
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.446
Two years, huh?

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.443
Any more trees I need to know about?

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.521
Look out!

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.325
Never seen that before.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.289
These robots have been breaking down.

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.011
This guy makes fifteen?

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.727
Fifteen.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.245
The breakfast bar went crazy today.

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.641
- Yeah, and an elevator.
- Last week, my door broke.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.927
- I was trapped in my cabin for two days.
- You were?

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.846
Things like that don't happen.
Not on this ship.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.768
There are 16 of these tech stations
on every deck.

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.886
Dock your slate.

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.176
- Data syncs automatically. Got it?
- Hmm.

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.884
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.407
You take decks one and two.
You take decks three and four.

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.405
I'm going down to the hibernation bay,
check our pods.

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.565
Well, that should be interesting.

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:00.000
Ain't you supposed to be
making your rounds?

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.440
I'm finished.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.889
I checked your pod.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.491
Problem's very simple.
The clock chip's burnt out.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.325
It ain't supposed to happen,
but pretty simple.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:14.890
My pod's more complicated.

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.850
Bunch of system failures that
all happened at the same time.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.729
Whole damn thing went haywire.

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.929
Explains why I'm feeling so bad.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.606
But Aurora's pod...

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.404
You did this.

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:34.841
Yeah.

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.366
All this time, I'm thinking
you're one lucky son of a bitch

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.090
to get stuck with Aurora.

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.403
It wasn't luck, was it?

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:45.961
No.

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.121
She knows?

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:48.966
She knows.

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.400
How long were you alone?

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.325
A year.

01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.325
Still...

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:02.650
Damn.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.090
<i>Data received.</i>

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.280
<i>Data received.</i>

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:22.208
<i>- Data received.</i>
- Same as Jim's.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.486
<i>Interpolating data.</i>

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.608
System shutdowns...

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.967
Everywhere, but no apparent connection.

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.285
You saw the hibernation pods?

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.401
I saw them.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:35.647
<i>Data received.</i>

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.006
So you know

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.361
what Jim did.

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.691
Yeah.

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.481
And?

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.401
- It's not my...
- He woke me up.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.445
He took away my life.

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.602
I know, and I'm sorry,
but there's work I'd...

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.444
It's murder.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.930
You're right, Aurora.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.607
But the drowning man will always try
and drag somebody down with him.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:05.326
It ain't right, but the man's drowning.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.044
This one makes 16.

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:13.681
Yeah.

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.689
Hey. You okay?

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.920
- You should go rest.
- Yeah.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:28.083
But just a couple hours, and then back
at it first thing in the morning.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:16.856
I was in the pool when
the gravity gave out.

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.006
Are you okay?

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.730
We need to find Gus.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.962
<i>Gus! Gus!</i>

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:27.160
Gravity loss means that whatever's wrong
is starting to hit the big-ticket items.

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.440
Not good.

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:31.004
Every failure's a burnt out processor.

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.845
Everything on board's thinking too hard.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.600
Why?

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:39.085
Computer, display these failures over time.

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.288
<i>Processing timeline.</i>

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.085
Cascade failure.

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:47.606
It started two years ago. Power surge.

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.722
Seventeen failures in one day.

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.608
Including hibernation pod 1498.

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:54.767
That's me.

01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:56.885
Woke me up.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.091
- What happened that day?
- Something big.

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.328
A major system went down somewhere.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.087
Everything else on board
is trying to pick up the load,

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.889
but the load's too heavy.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.803
Whatever started this, we got to find it.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.007
And fix it.

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:12.411
How bad can this get?

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.007
Give me risk analysis based on this data.

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.127
<i>Extrapolating.</i>

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:20.326
<i>A mission-critical failure is imminent.</i>

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:23.370
<i>Failing systems.
Life Support, Fusion Reactor...</i>

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:24.606
So we're stranded.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.648
<i>Hibernation Bay, Ion Drive...</i>

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.210
On a sinking ship.

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.083
<i>Main Engineering.</i>

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.050
Not a lot of things big enough
to hit this ship that hard.

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:47.731
With Diagnostics out,
we'll have to find it ourselves.

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:50.323
Where do we start?

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:52.365
Gus!

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:58.485
<i>Scan complete. Analyzing data.</i>

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.520
What's it say is wrong with me?

01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.444
It's a few things.

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:08.124
<i>612 disorders found.</i>

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.526
Get me out of here.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.685
What's the prognosis?

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:30.082
<i>Critical diagnoses cannot be
discussed without a doctor in attendance.</i>

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.849

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.480
Lay it on me, doc.

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.369
<i>Pansystemic necrosis.</i>

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:41.171
<i>Progressive organ failure. Cause, unknown.</i>

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:43.722
My goofy hibernation pod. That's the cause.

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:47.244
- What's the treatment?
<i>- Various treatments are possible.</i>

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:49.561
<i>None will meaningfully extend
the patient's life.</i>

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.646
How long have I got?

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.291
<i>Your end-of-life transition

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:02.805
<i>These sedatives will alleviate your

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:21.925
Gus.

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:28.330
I need a minute.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:59.856
<i>We are experiencing

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.043

- Gus!

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.256
Where could he be?

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:07.170
<i>For your own safety,

<i>For your own safety,

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.524
Should've took the damn pills.

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:23.011
- I'll go get them.
- No. Stay here with me.

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:26.244
Sit down.

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.642
You two take care of each other.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.571
My ID.

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.880
Get you where you need to go.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.764
Fix the ship.

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.002
Find out what's wrong with her.

01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:58.526
How do I look?

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.529
You look magnificent.

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:04.651
Ladies love the dress blues.

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.281
What do we do now?

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.086
This can't be good.

01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:29.164
I'm going back to Engineering.

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.810
Can you fix this?

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:32.885
I need your help.

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:36.921
Let's go.

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:00.927
Arthur!

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.401
Let's go.

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.241
Yeah.

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.483
<i>Main Engineering.</i>

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:25.528
Can't we wake up some of the crew?

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.976
It'll take them too long to recover.
We don't have that kind of time.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.445
What are we even looking for?

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:33.244
Something broken. Something big.

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:35.526
Come on.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.281
Is it broken?

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.522
It seems okay. What's next?

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.967
Power plant. This way.

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:50.444
Come on.

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.456
The whole section's closed off.
Something's wrong.

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:54.050
We're looking for wrong.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.121
Try to open it.

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:11.883
A hole in the ship.

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.561
More than one.

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:22.124
How did that even happen?
The ship's supposed to be meteor-proof.

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:23.360
I guess one got through.

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.521
It's hot.

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:41.160
I think we found it.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:54.080
It's the reactor-control computer.

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:01.570
This is what hit us two years ago.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:03.005
Jim...

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:04.891
How can we fix this?

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.761
We're gonna die.

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:11.609
There's replacement pans for everything.

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.443
- Light.
- Sorry.

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.411
Soon as I pull this module,
the entire computer's gonna shut down.

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.323
Well, what happens then?

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:28.530
I'll get it back up as quickly as I can.

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:34.281
Hurry!

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.729
- Jim!
- Okay.

The outer door is jammed.

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:16.096
We've got to open that door
and cool the reactor down,

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:17.485
or the whole ship is gonna blow.

01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:20.327
- How?
- I got to go out there.

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.004
Open it from the outside.

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:24.530
I open the door, I get clear.

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:28.610
- You blow that fire into space.
- You get clear?

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:30.250
You can talk to me through this.

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.362
What happens to you when that door opens?

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.365
Heat shield. It might help.

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.250
You might need this.

01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:09.921
It's gonna be okay.

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.321
I better go.

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:29.086
Jim. Jim.

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.925
Come back to me.

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:27.206
<i>Go.</i>

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:36.001

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.361
<i>The door won't open.</i>

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:19.170

<i>Please hurry!</i>

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:30.160
<i>- Okay, I'm trying it again.
- Tell me when you're clear.</i>

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:36.364
<i>- No!</i>
- What?

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:38.207
What's going on?

01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.251
<i>Hold the door open.</i>

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:53.561
What?

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:54.721
No!

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.530
<i>No way! Get out of there!</i>

01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.125
<i>I can't.</i>

01:33:58.200 --> 01:33:59.565
<i>Jim.</i>

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:00.921
<i>We're out of time.</i>

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:05.246
<i>- Containment unstable.</i>
- Jim?

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:13.127
<i>Vent the reactor.</i>

01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:22.407
<i>No! You don't understand!</i>

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:25.891
<i>If I open the door right now,
it'll kill you!</i>

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.961
<i>I'm hoping not.</i>

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:28.923
Come back in.
We'll think of something else.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.411
<i>There is nothing else.</i>

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:32.887
<i>Jim!</i>

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:35.081
<i>- It's okay.
- No!</i>

01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:37.003
- It's not okay!
<i>- Aurora...</i>

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:38.889
<i>Warning.
Temperature level exceeded.</i>

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:40.969
This isn't what you said was gonna happen!

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:44.005
<i>Aurora, this ship is gonna go.</i>

01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:46.082
I don't care! You die, I die.

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:49.771
<i>There are 5,000 other people
on this ship, Aurora.</i>

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.401
<i>We have to do this.</i>

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.445
<i>Maximum pressure reached.</i>

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.128
<i>Do it. Now.</i>

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:04.882
<i>Maximum cabin pressure reached.</i>

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.885
<i>Temperature dropping.</i>

01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.481
Jim.

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:51.288
- Jim?
<i>- Vent successful.</i>

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.886
<i>Rebooting process initiated.</i>

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:55.320
Jim, please say something.

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.284
<i>Suit pressure dropping.</i>

01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:40.206
<i>Return to ship immediately.</i>

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.286
<i>Aurora?</i>

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:45.961
It worked!

01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:47.405
You did it! You can come in!

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:50.251
<i>Uh, yeah, about that.</i>

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.448
What's the matter? Are you hurt?

01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:54.249
<i>I got blown out of the tube.</i>

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:55.970
- What?
<i>- My tether broke.</i>

01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:58.242
<i>I can't get back to the ship.</i>

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:00.763
I'll come out. I'll come out.
I'll pull you in.

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:03.531
<i>Warning. Oxygen level critical.</i>

01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:05.848
<i>Return to ship immediately.</i>

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:17.046
<i>Aurora, I'm sorry.</i>

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.081
<i>For everything.</i>

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:22.447
Shut up. I'm coming.

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:26.605
<i>I wish we'd have met in 90 years.</i>

01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:34.964
<i>I'd... I'd have built you a house.</i>

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:41.762
<i>I'd have read your book.</i>

01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:45.566
<i>It's gonna be great.</i>

01:37:58.200 --> 01:37:59.201
<i>Tether attached.</i>

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:01.324
<i>Locate Jim Preston.</i>

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.480
<i>Jim Preston located.</i>

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:10.971
<i>I'm coming to get you.</i>

01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:37.485
<i>Jim!</i>

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:39.289
<i>I'm sorry. The patient is dead.</i>

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.529
Well, resuscitate him!

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.649
<i>Postmortem operations require
authorized medical supervision.</i>

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:46.529
No.

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.571
Jim.

01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:55.485
Override!

01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:57.005
Override on my authority!

01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:59.890
ID 1-7...

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:03.684
Two...

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.330
Two. Two.

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:06.606
2-3-1-7.

01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:09.560
2-3-1-7! ID 2-3-1-7!

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:14.601
Resuscitation.

01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.842
<i>Multiple procedures
are not recommended.</i>

01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:22.287
Override! Do it now!

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:24.001
<i>Executing.</i>

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:21.321
Hi!

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:24.281
Jim!

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:28.406
Hey, Jim.

01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:58.368
You brought me back.

01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:00.131
Yeah.

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:26.328
- Thank you.
- Be still.

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:27.926
Of course.

01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:15.164
There's something I have to show you.

01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:16.736
In command mode, it turns out

01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:21.004
the Autodoc has an option
called Stabilize and Suspend.

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:23.647
It stops all metabolic activity.

01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:26.521
What are you saying?

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:30.407
With Gus's ID, it can be like hibernation
inside the Autodoc.

01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:31.481
You can go back to sleep.

01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:38.483
But there's only one Autodoc.

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:44.325
Yeah.

01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:50.405
And you're gonna lay down in it
and fall asleep.

01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:53.761
And you'll wake up on Homestead II.

01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:55.649
And you'll write your book.

01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:58.401
You'd finish your journey.

01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:00.369
You'd do what you set out to do.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.684
You'd be alone.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.729
I've been alone before.

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:15.480
And I'll be fine.

01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:19.004
But I would never see you again.

01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:24.365
I'll come and visit you.

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:09.050
Tuesday is my day with Arthur.

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:12.725
Lovely as ever.

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:15.041
Thank you, Arthur.
You're looking very well yourself.

01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:16.565
Thanks to you.

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:18.561
What's that?

01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:23.602
Something I've wanted to give you
for a long time.

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:32.564
It's beautiful.

01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:47.762
Took you long enough to ask.

01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:52.285
Champagne.

01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:53.887
I'll wait.

01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:12.969
Hell of a life.

01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:16.965
Hell of a life.

01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:51.847
<i>Crew wake-up process initiated.</i>

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.329
<i>My fellow passengers,</i>

01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:55.845
<i>if you're reading this,</i>

01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:59.686
<i>then the Starship Avalon
has reached its destination.</i>

01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:02.047
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:03.963
<i>A lot happened while you slept.</i>

01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:13.529
<i>A friend once said,</i>

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.683
<i>"You can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be</i>

01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:19.843
<i>"that you forget to make
the most of where you are."</i>

01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:22.888
<i>We got lost along the way.</i>

01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:25.564
<i>But we found each other.</i>

01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:28.089
<i>And we made a life.</i>

01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:30.288
<i>A beautiful life.</i>

01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:32.364
<i>Together.</i>

01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:41.922
<i>There's so much on my mind
I don't know where to start</i>

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:47.404
<i>There's that light in your eye
Filling up the dark</i>

01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:53.882
<i>Just levitate, just levitate</i>

01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:59.724
<i>Just levitate, just levitate</i>

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:05.883
<i>I know that we're far
From where we need to be</i>

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:11.006
<i>But the world wasn't made in just one day</i>

01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:17.923
<i>Though our journey's long
I know our love is strong</i>

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.723
<i>You're my shooting star
We're flying higher, babe</i>

01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:29.844
<i>Just levitate, just levitate</i>

01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:35.604

<i>Just levitate, just levitate</i>

01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:54.049
<i>When I'm stuck in the
middle of hell and faith</i>

01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:59.001
<i>And I don't know where to turn</i>

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:04.806
<i>To bend my mind as the silver gate</i>

01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:10.840
<i>You lead me on my way</i>

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:17.810
<i>Just levitate, just levitate</i>

01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:23.042
