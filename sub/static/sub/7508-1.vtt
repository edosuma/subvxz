00:41.833 --> 00:45.565
<i>For more than a year, ominous rumors
had been privately circulating...</i>

00:45.638 --> 00:48.072
<i>among high-level Western leaders...</i>

00:48.140 --> 00:52.008
<i>that the Soviet Union had been at work
on what was darkly hinted to be...</i>

00:52.078 --> 00:55.776
<i>the ultimate weapon:
A doomsday device.</i>

00:55.849 --> 00:59.751
<i>Intelligence sources traced the site
of the top-secret Russian project...</i>

00:59.821 --> 01:02.517
<i>to the perpetually
fog-shrouded wasteland...</i>

01:02.590 --> 01:05.991
<i>below the Arctic peaks
of the Zhokhov Islands.</i>

01:06.060 --> 01:11.397
<i>What they were building or why it was
located in a remote, desolate place...</i>

01:11.467 --> 01:13.731
<i>no one could say.</i>

03:44.040 --> 03:45.508
General Ripper, sir.

03:45.576 --> 03:47.510
Group Captain Mandrake speaking.

03:47.578 --> 03:49.569
This is General Ripper speaking.

03:49.647 --> 03:51.843
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Do you recognize my voice?</i>

03:51.917 --> 03:54.317
I do, sir. Why do you ask?

03:54.386 --> 03:56.149
Why do you think?

03:56.221 --> 03:59.817
I don't know, sir. We spoke
just a few moments ago, didn't we?

03:59.892 --> 04:05.125
You don't think I'd ask unless it was
pretty damned important, do you?

04:05.198 --> 04:06.632
No, I don't.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.895
<i>Let's see if we can stay on the ball.</i>

04:09.836 --> 04:12.430
Has the Wing confirmed holding
at their fail-safe points?

04:12.506 --> 04:15.340
Yes, sir. The confirmations
have just come in.

04:15.410 --> 04:19.039
Very well.
Now, listen to me carefully.

04:19.113 --> 04:21.911
The base is being put on condition red.

04:21.983 --> 04:24.214
I want this flashed
to all sections immediately.

04:24.286 --> 04:27.619
Condition red. Jolly good.
Keeps the men on their toes.

04:27.691 --> 04:29.955
This is not an exercise.

04:31.027 --> 04:32.892
Not an exercise?

04:34.598 --> 04:39.229
I shouldn't tell you this, but you're
a good officer and have a right to know.

04:39.303 --> 04:41.237
It looks like we're in a shooting war.

04:42.241 --> 04:47.201
<i>- Oh, hell. Are the Russians involved?
- That's all I've been told.</i>

04:47.279 --> 04:52.047
It came in on the red phone. I'm gonna
follow orders and seal this base tight.

04:53.152 --> 04:56.680
Now, I want you to transmit Plan R...

04:56.757 --> 04:58.691
R for Robert, to the Wing.

04:58.759 --> 05:02.160
<i>- Plan R for Robert.
- Is it that bad, sir?</i>

05:02.229 --> 05:04.721
<i>- Looks like it's pretty hairy.
- Yes, sir.</i>

05:04.799 --> 05:06.824
Plan R for Robert.

05:06.901 --> 05:10.234
Last and possibly most important...

05:10.305 --> 05:14.538
I want all privately owned radios
to be immediately impounded.

05:14.610 --> 05:18.547
They might be used to issue
instructions to saboteurs.

05:18.615 --> 05:21.482
As I previously arranged, Air Police
will have lists of all owners.

05:21.551 --> 05:25.545
I want every one collected
without exception.

05:25.623 --> 05:27.921
After you've done that,
report back to me.

05:55.057 --> 05:57.719
<i>In order to guard against
surprise nuclear attack...</i>

05:57.793 --> 06:01.230
<i>America's Strategic Air Command
maintains...</i>

06:01.297 --> 06:05.427
<i>a large force of B-52 bombers
airborne 24 hours a day.</i>

06:05.501 --> 06:10.405
<i>Each B-52 can deliver
a nuclear bomb load of 50 megatons...</i>

06:10.474 --> 06:15.503
<i>equal to 16 times the total
explosive force of all the bombs...</i>

06:15.580 --> 06:20.142
<i>and shells used by all the armies
in World War II.</i>

06:20.218 --> 06:23.347
<i>Based in America,
the Airborne Alert Force...</i>

06:23.422 --> 06:26.220
<i>is deployed from the Persian Gulf
to the Arctic Ocean.</i>

06:26.292 --> 06:29.090
<i>But they have one geographical factor
in common.</i>

06:29.161 --> 06:33.121
<i>They are all two hours
from their targets inside Russia.</i>

07:53.157 --> 07:56.150
Major Kong, I know you'll think
this is crazy...

07:56.228 --> 07:59.891
but I just got a message from base
over the C.R.M. 114.

08:00.966 --> 08:04.926
It decodes as Wing attack Plan R.
R for Romeo.

08:08.041 --> 08:12.308
Goldie, did you say
Wing attack Plan R?

08:12.379 --> 08:13.903
Yes, sir, I have.

08:17.719 --> 08:22.418
Goldie, how many times have
I told you guys that I don't want...

08:22.491 --> 08:24.426
<i>horsin'around on the airplane?</i>

08:24.494 --> 08:26.758
I'm not horsing around.
That's how it decodes.

08:26.829 --> 08:29.491
I've been to one world fair,
a picnic...

08:29.565 --> 08:33.433
<i>and a rodeo, and that's the stupidest
thing I heard over earphones.</i>

08:33.504 --> 08:35.404
You sure you got today's code?

08:36.840 --> 08:37.932
Yes, sir.

08:38.008 --> 08:40.568
There's gotta be something wrong.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.010
Wait a second, I'm coming back.

09:17.487 --> 09:21.150
Maybe you'd better get
a confirmation from base.

09:21.224 --> 09:22.658
Yes, sir.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.378
Major Kong, is it possible
this is some kind of loyalty test?

09:46.453 --> 09:50.116
You know, give the go code and then
recall to see who would actually go?

09:50.190 --> 09:54.321
Ain't nobody ever got
the go code yet.

09:54.395 --> 09:56.795
Old Ripper wouldn't be giving us
Plan R...

09:56.864 --> 09:59.493
unless them Ruskies had already
clobbered Washington...

09:59.568 --> 10:01.866
and a lot of other towns
with a sneak attack.

10:01.937 --> 10:03.199
Yes, sir.

10:03.272 --> 10:05.764
Major Kong,
message from base confirmed.

10:10.614 --> 10:12.981
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.

10:14.051 --> 10:17.316
Nuclear combat toe-to-toe
with the Ruskies.

10:32.372 --> 10:37.242
Boys, I ain't much of a hand
at making speeches.

10:38.679 --> 10:41.979
But I got a fair idea
that something doggone important...

10:42.050 --> 10:44.041
is going on back there.

10:44.119 --> 10:47.988
I've got a fair idea of the kind
of personal emotions...

10:48.057 --> 10:51.515
<i>that some of you fellows
may be thinking.</i>

10:51.594 --> 10:54.324
<i>Heck, I reckon you wouldn't be
human beings...</i>

10:54.397 --> 10:58.994
<i>if you didn't have pretty strong
personal feelings about nuclear combat.</i>

10:59.069 --> 11:02.005
<i>I want you to remember one thing.</i>

11:02.073 --> 11:04.837
<i>The folks back home
are counting on you.</i>

11:04.909 --> 11:07.241
<i>And by golly,
we ain't about to let them down.</i>

11:08.579 --> 11:11.378
Tell you something else.

11:11.450 --> 11:16.445
If this thing turns out to be half
as important as I figure it might be...

11:16.523 --> 11:20.550
I'd say you're all in line
for some important promotions...

11:20.627 --> 11:24.428
and personal citations
when this thing's over with.

11:24.498 --> 11:27.262
That goes for every last one of you...

11:27.334 --> 11:31.169
regardless of your race,
color or your creed.

11:31.239 --> 11:34.800
Now let's get this thing on the hump.
We got some flying to do.

11:48.425 --> 11:50.655
Buck, should I get it?

11:50.728 --> 11:52.663
Yeah, you'll have to.

11:58.603 --> 12:00.367
Hello?

12:00.439 --> 12:05.035
Yes, General Turgidson is here,
but he can't come to the phone now.

12:05.111 --> 12:07.376
This is his secretary, Miss Scott.

12:08.515 --> 12:10.710
Freddie, how are you?

12:10.784 --> 12:13.048
Fine. And you?

12:13.120 --> 12:17.785
Oh, we were just catching up
on some of the general's paperwork.

12:17.859 --> 12:22.490
He's tied up.
I'm afraid he can't come to the phone.

12:23.565 --> 12:24.998
Just a minute.

12:25.067 --> 12:28.333
General Turgidson,
a Colonel Puntrich calling.

12:28.404 --> 12:30.338
Tell him to call back.

12:30.406 --> 12:35.105
Freddie, the general says
could you call back in a minute?

12:35.179 --> 12:37.113
He says it can't wait.

12:37.181 --> 12:40.514
For Pete's...
Find out what he wants.

12:40.584 --> 12:44.487
The general is in the powder room
right now.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.820
Could you tell me what it's about?

12:48.260 --> 12:52.357
Just a second. Apparently they monitored
a transmission eight minutes ago...

12:52.431 --> 12:54.922
from Burpelson Air Force Base.

12:56.770 --> 13:01.833
Right. It was directed to
the 843rd Bomb Wing on airborne alert.

13:03.610 --> 13:07.069
It decoded as Wing attack Plan R.

13:07.148 --> 13:12.815
Well, tell him to call what's-his-name,
Base Commander Ripper.

13:12.888 --> 13:14.549
Do I have to think of everything?

13:14.623 --> 13:19.220
The general suggests you call General
Ripper, the 843rd base commander.

13:19.296 --> 13:22.697
Oh. All communications are dead!

13:22.766 --> 13:26.168
Bull! Tell him to do it himself.

13:26.237 --> 13:31.174
The general asks if you could
possibly try again yourself.

13:31.242 --> 13:35.907
I see. He says he's tried personally
several times, but everything is dead.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.745
Even the normal phone lines
are shut down.

13:46.025 --> 13:48.859
Fred? Buck.
What's it look like?

13:50.464 --> 13:51.897
Yeah?

13:53.334 --> 13:56.327
Well, are you sure
it's Plan R?

13:57.572 --> 14:00.268
Huh. What's cooking
on the threat board?

14:00.342 --> 14:03.141
Nothing? Nothing at all?

14:05.314 --> 14:07.373
I don't like the look of this.

14:08.852 --> 14:11.480
Tell you what you better do,
old buddy.

14:11.555 --> 14:14.718
You better give Elmo and Charlie a blast
and bump everything up to condition red.

14:14.791 --> 14:17.352
Stand by the blower.
I'll get back to you.

14:17.428 --> 14:19.623
- What's up?
- Nothing.

14:21.199 --> 14:24.499
- Where's my shorts?
- On the floor. Where are you going?

14:24.570 --> 14:26.333
No place.

14:26.405 --> 14:31.139
I thought I might mosey over to the
War Room to see what's doing over there.

14:31.211 --> 14:33.008
It's 3:00 in the morning.

14:33.079 --> 14:35.013
The air force never sleeps.

14:35.081 --> 14:39.018
Buck, honey, I'm not sleepy either.

14:41.689 --> 14:44.488
I know how it is, baby.

14:44.559 --> 14:46.584
Tell you what you do.

14:47.629 --> 14:51.589
You start your countdown
and old Bucky will be back...

14:51.668 --> 14:55.229
before you can say "Blastoff!"

14:56.506 --> 15:00.603
<i>Your Commie has no regard
for human life, not even his own.</i>

15:01.779 --> 15:05.613
<i>For this reason, men, I want
to impress upon you the need...</i>

15:05.683 --> 15:07.777
<i>for extreme watchfullness.</i>

15:07.852 --> 15:11.879
<i>The enemy may come individually
or he may come in strength.</i>

15:11.957 --> 15:14.552
He may even come in the uniform
of our own troops.

15:15.528 --> 15:18.122
<i>But however he comes,
we must stop him.</i>

15:18.197 --> 15:20.962
<i>We must not allow him
to gain entrance to this base.</i>

15:22.502 --> 15:26.438
<i>Now, I am going to give you
three simple rules.</i>

15:26.506 --> 15:31.001
<i>First: Trust no one,
whatever his uniform or rank...</i>

15:31.079 --> 15:33.570
<i>unless he is known to you personally.</i>

15:33.648 --> 15:36.516
<i>Secondly: Anyone or anything...</i>

15:36.585 --> 15:41.488
that approaches within 200 yards
of the perimeter is to be fired upon.

15:41.557 --> 15:47.190
Third: If in doubt, shoot first
and ask questions afterwards.

15:47.263 --> 15:50.631
<i>I would sooner accept a few casualties
through accident...</i>

15:50.701 --> 15:54.831
<i>than lose the entire base
and its personnel through carelessness.</i>

15:54.905 --> 15:59.036
<i>Any variation on these rules
must come from me personally.</i>

16:00.112 --> 16:02.945
<i>Now, men, in conclusion...</i>

16:03.015 --> 16:07.077
<i>I would like to say
that in the two years...</i>

16:07.153 --> 16:10.954
<i>that it has been my privilege
to be your commanding officer...</i>

16:11.025 --> 16:13.960
<i>I have always expected
the best from you...</i>

16:14.028 --> 16:17.931
<i>and you have never given me
anything less than that.</i>

16:17.999 --> 16:21.366
<i>Today the nation is counting on us.</i>

16:22.437 --> 16:25.271
<i>We are not going to let them down.</i>

16:25.341 --> 16:27.275
<i>Good luck to you all.</i>

16:57.477 --> 17:00.002
Here's the attack profile, sir.

17:27.778 --> 17:30.441
This is your attack profile.

17:30.515 --> 17:33.609
"To ensure that the enemy cannot monitor
voice transmission...

17:33.685 --> 17:35.846
or plant false transmission...

17:35.920 --> 17:41.052
the C.R.M. 114 is to be switched
into all receiver circuits.

17:41.127 --> 17:44.586
The emergency base code prefix
is to be set...

17:44.664 --> 17:47.064
<i>on the dials of the C.R.M.</i>

17:47.134 --> 17:51.697
<i>This will block any transmission other
than those preceded by a code prefix. "</i>

17:53.274 --> 17:55.435
Stand by to set code prefix.

17:55.510 --> 17:57.979
Roger. Ready to set code prefix.

17:58.046 --> 17:59.911
"Set code prefix."

18:09.459 --> 18:10.892
Code prefix set.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.622
"Lock code prefix."

18:15.299 --> 18:16.732
Code prefix locked.

18:16.800 --> 18:20.293
"Switch all receiver circuits
to C.R.M. Discriminators."

18:21.506 --> 18:24.737
Switched to C.R.M. Discriminators.

18:24.809 --> 18:26.675
<i>"Check auto destruct circuits."</i>

18:29.982 --> 18:31.916
Auto destruct circuits checked.

18:37.324 --> 18:41.728
"Primary target:
The I.C.B.M. Complex at Laputa.

18:41.796 --> 18:46.028
Target reference:
Yankee, golf, tango...

18:46.100 --> 18:48.160
3-6-0.

18:48.237 --> 18:50.171
Thirty megaton nuclear device...

18:50.239 --> 18:54.335
<i>fused for air burst at 10,000 feet.</i>

18:54.410 --> 18:58.905
<i>Twenty megaton nuclear device

<i>Otherwise, proceed to secondary target:</i>

Fused air burst at 10..."
Check..."12,000 feet."

19:29.016 --> 19:32.919
Excuse me, sir. Something rather
interesting has just cropped up.

19:32.988 --> 19:35.821
Listen to that. Music.
Civilian broadcasting.

19:37.425 --> 19:41.692
I think the Pentagon has given us
an exercise to check our readiness.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.755
I think it's taking things too far.

19:43.833 --> 19:46.860
Our fellows will be inside Russian
radar cover in about 20 minutes.

19:46.937 --> 19:50.168
Listen. Chock full of stations
all churning it out.

19:51.942 --> 19:53.706
- Mandrake?
- Yes, sir?

19:53.778 --> 19:57.214
I issued instructions for all radios
to be impounded.

19:57.282 --> 20:01.583
You did, and I was in the process of
impounding this when I switched it on.

20:01.654 --> 20:05.146
I thought our fellows hitting Russian
radar, dropping all their stuff...

20:05.224 --> 20:09.685
I'd better tell you because if they do,
it'll cause a stink.

20:09.763 --> 20:13.824
Group Captain,
the officer exchange program...

20:13.900 --> 20:17.530
does not give you any special
prerogatives to question my orders.

20:17.605 --> 20:21.838
I realize that, sir, but I thought
you'd be pleased to hear the news.

20:21.910 --> 20:24.674
After all, let's face it.

20:24.746 --> 20:28.740
We don't want to start a nuclear war
unless we have to, do we?

20:29.719 --> 20:33.382
Please sit down.
And turn that thing off.

20:33.456 --> 20:34.582
Yes, sir.

20:34.657 --> 20:39.561
What about the planes? Surely we must
issue the recall code immediately.

20:39.630 --> 20:42.497
The planes are not going
to be recalled.

20:42.566 --> 20:45.434
My attack orders have been issued,
and the orders stand.

20:47.472 --> 20:51.637
If you'll excuse me for saying so,
that would be to my way of thinking...

20:51.711 --> 20:53.872
rather an odd way of looking at it

20:53.946 --> 20:56.346
If a Russian attack was in progress...

20:56.415 --> 21:00.352
we would certainly not be hearing
civilian broadcasting.

21:00.420 --> 21:03.287
- Are you certain?
- I'm absolutely positive.

21:03.357 --> 21:06.088
What if it is true?

21:06.160 --> 21:09.186
I'm afraid I'm still not with you, sir,
because I mean...

21:10.765 --> 21:13.132
if a Russian attack
was not in progress...

21:13.202 --> 21:17.571
then your use of Plan R... In fact,
your orders to the entire Wing...

21:25.048 --> 21:30.316
I would say, sir, that there was
something dreadfully wrong somewhere

21:31.389 --> 21:33.756
Why don't you take it easy,
Group Captain?

21:33.825 --> 21:36.487
Please make me a drink
of grain alcohol and rainwater...

21:36.561 --> 21:38.995
and help yourself
to whatever you'd like.

21:48.041 --> 21:52.137
General Ripper, sir, as an officer
in Her Majesty's Air Force...

21:52.212 --> 21:55.478
it is my clear duty
under the present circumstances...

21:55.550 --> 22:00.249
to issue the recall code upon my
own authority and bring back the Wing.

22:00.321 --> 22:02.313
If you'll excuse me, sir.

22:10.934 --> 22:15.837
Sir, I must ask you for the key and the
recall code. Have you got them handy?

22:15.907 --> 22:18.398
I told you to take it easy,
Group Captain.

22:18.476 --> 22:21.036
There's nothing anybody can do now.

22:21.112 --> 22:23.547
I'm the only person who knows
the three-letter code group.

22:23.615 --> 22:26.175
I must insist
that you give them to me!

22:35.261 --> 22:39.255
Do I take it, sir, you are threatening
a brother officer with a gun?

22:40.534 --> 22:45.666
Mandrake, I suppose
it never occurred to you...

22:45.740 --> 22:49.335
that while we're chatting here
so enjoyably...

22:49.411 --> 22:53.280
a decision is being made
by the president...

22:53.349 --> 22:56.512
and the joint chiefs in the War Room
at the Pentagon.

22:57.587 --> 23:03.185
When they realize there is
no possibility of recalling the Wing...

23:03.260 --> 23:07.561
there will be only one course
of action open.

23:07.632 --> 23:09.532
Total commitment.

23:11.803 --> 23:16.241
Mandrake, do you recall what
Clemenceau once said about war?

23:17.543 --> 23:20.239
No, I don't think I do, sir. No.

23:21.915 --> 23:24.941
He said war was too important
to be left to the generals.

23:26.019 --> 23:30.616
When he said that 50 years ago...

23:30.691 --> 23:32.659
he might have been right.

23:32.727 --> 23:35.094
But today...

23:35.163 --> 23:38.621
war is too important
to be left to politicians.

23:38.700 --> 23:43.161
They have neither the time,
the training...

23:43.239 --> 23:46.299
nor the inclination
for strategic thought.

23:49.947 --> 23:53.439
I can no longer sit back
and allow...

23:53.517 --> 23:58.683
Communist infiltration,
Communist indoctrination...

23:58.757 --> 24:00.384
Communist subversion...

24:01.860 --> 24:05.729
and the international
Communist conspiracy...

24:05.798 --> 24:08.665
to sap and impurify...

24:08.734 --> 24:12.068
all of our precious
bodily fluids.

24:18.246 --> 24:19.736
Staines, is everybody here?

24:19.814 --> 24:22.305
Mr. President, the secretary of state
is in Vietnam.

24:22.383 --> 24:26.343
The secretary of defense is in Laos, and
the vice president is in Mexico City.

24:26.422 --> 24:31.382
We can establish contact with them at
anytime. The undersecretaries are here.

24:31.460 --> 24:34.555
Right. General Turgidson,
what's going on?

24:36.099 --> 24:38.659
Mr. President...

24:38.735 --> 24:42.399
about 35 minutes ago...

24:42.473 --> 24:46.467
GeneralJack Ripper,
the commanding general...

24:46.545 --> 24:48.979
of Burpelson Air Force Base...

24:49.047 --> 24:52.312
issued an order to the 34 B-52s
of his Wing...

24:52.384 --> 24:54.512
which were airborne at the time...

24:54.587 --> 24:58.717
as part of a special exercise we were
holding called Operation Dropkick.

24:58.791 --> 25:03.491
It appears that the order
called for the planes...

25:03.564 --> 25:06.931
to attack their targets
inside Russia.

25:07.001 --> 25:11.234
The planes are fully armed
with nuclear weapons...

25:11.306 --> 25:14.833
with an average load
of 40 megatons each.

25:14.909 --> 25:19.370
The central display of Russia will
indicate the position of the planes.

25:20.850 --> 25:24.082
The triangles
are their primary targets.

25:24.154 --> 25:27.089
The squares
are their secondary targets.

25:28.158 --> 25:33.461
The aircraft will begin penetrating
Russian radar cover within 25 minutes.

25:35.667 --> 25:38.967
General Turgidson, I find this
very difficult to understand.

25:39.038 --> 25:44.306
I understood I was the only one
to order the use of nuclear weapons.

25:45.445 --> 25:49.541
That's right, sir. You are
the only person authorized to do so.

25:49.616 --> 25:53.917
And although I hate to judge
before all the facts are in...

25:53.988 --> 25:57.617
it's beginning to look like
General Ripper exceeded his authority.

25:57.692 --> 26:02.562
It certainly does, far beyond the point
I would have imagined possible.

26:02.631 --> 26:06.261
Perhaps you're forgetting
the provisions of Plan R, sir.

26:06.335 --> 26:08.166
Plan R?

26:09.572 --> 26:13.134
Plan R is an emergency war plan...

26:13.210 --> 26:15.735
in which a lower echelon commander
may order...

26:15.813 --> 26:18.941
nuclear retaliation
after a sneak attack...

26:19.016 --> 26:22.509
if the normal chain of command
has been disrupted.

26:22.587 --> 26:25.488
You approved it, sir.
You must remember.

26:27.026 --> 26:30.860
Surely you must recall, sir,
when Senator Beaufort made...

26:30.930 --> 26:33.899
that big hassle about our deterrent
lacking credibility.

26:33.967 --> 26:38.700
The idea was for Plan R to be
a sort of retaliatory safeguard.

26:38.772 --> 26:40.763
A safeguard?

26:40.841 --> 26:44.107
I admit the human element seems
to have failed us here.

26:44.178 --> 26:47.579
But the idea was to discourage
the Ruskies from any hope...

26:47.648 --> 26:52.245
they could knock out Washington, and
yourself, as part of a sneak attack...

26:52.321 --> 26:56.520
and escape retaliation because of lack
of proper command and control.

26:56.593 --> 26:59.289
I assume the planes will return
automatically...

26:59.362 --> 27:01.387
once they reach their fail-safe points.

27:02.499 --> 27:07.028
I'm afraid not. The planes were holding
at their fail-safe points...

27:07.104 --> 27:09.129
when the go code was issued.

27:09.206 --> 27:13.701
Once they fly beyond fail-safe, they do
not require a second order to proceed.

27:13.779 --> 27:15.713
They will continue
until they reach their target.

27:15.781 --> 27:18.842
Then why haven't you radioed the planes,
countermanding the go code?

27:20.520 --> 27:23.546
We're unable to communicate
with any of the aircraft.

27:23.623 --> 27:25.819
Why?

27:25.893 --> 27:28.293
As you may recall, sir...

27:28.362 --> 27:31.992
one of the provisions
of Plan R provides...

27:32.066 --> 27:36.662
that once the go code
is received...

27:36.738 --> 27:40.072
the normal S.S.B. Radios
in the aircraft...

27:40.142 --> 27:42.610
are switched into
a special coded device...

27:42.678 --> 27:45.739
which I believe is designated
as C.R.M. 114.

27:45.816 --> 27:50.253
In order to prevent the enemy
from issuing fake or confusing orders...

27:50.320 --> 27:54.257
C.R.M. 114 is designed
not to receive at all...

27:54.325 --> 27:59.854
unless the message is proceeded by the
correct three-letter code group prefix.

27:59.931 --> 28:05.302
You mean to tell me you will be unable
to recall the aircraft?

28:05.370 --> 28:08.306
That's the size of it.
However, we are plowing through...

28:08.374 --> 28:11.275
every possible three-letter combination
of the code.

28:11.344 --> 28:16.544
But since there are
17,000 permutations...

28:16.617 --> 28:20.212
it's going to take us about two
and a half days to transmit them all.

28:20.287 --> 28:23.052
How soon will the planes penetrate
Russian radar cover?

28:23.124 --> 28:26.616
- About 18 minutes from now.
- Are you in contact with General Ripper?

28:26.695 --> 28:31.599
No, sir. General Ripper sealed off
the base and cut off communications.

28:31.667 --> 28:33.294
Where did you get this information?

28:33.369 --> 28:36.965
General Ripper called
Strategic Air Command Headquarters...

28:37.040 --> 28:39.565
shortly after he issued the go code.

28:39.643 --> 28:43.273
I have a portion of the conversation
transcript if you'd like me to read it.

28:43.348 --> 28:45.111
Read it.

28:46.918 --> 28:49.682
The duty officer asked
General Ripper...

28:49.754 --> 28:53.020
to confirm the fact that he had
issued the go code and he said:

28:54.026 --> 28:58.327
"Yes, gentlemen, they are on their way
in and no one can bring them back.

28:58.398 --> 29:01.196
For the sake of our country
and our way of life...

29:01.268 --> 29:03.964
I suggest you get the rest of SAC
in after them.

29:04.037 --> 29:08.941
Otherwise, we will be totally destroyed
by Red retaliation.

29:09.010 --> 29:14.313
My boys will give you the best kind
of start: 1,400 megatons worth.

29:14.383 --> 29:17.944
And you sure as hell
won't stop them now.

29:18.020 --> 29:20.888
So let's get going.
There's no other choice.

29:20.957 --> 29:25.826
God willing, we will prevail
in peace and freedom from fear...

29:25.895 --> 29:29.297
and in true health
through the purity...

29:29.366 --> 29:33.235
and essence of our natural...

29:33.305 --> 29:34.738
fluids.

29:35.740 --> 29:37.731
God bless you all."

29:39.678 --> 29:42.307
Then he hung up.

29:42.381 --> 29:45.976
We're still trying to figure out
the meaning of that last phrase, sir.

29:46.052 --> 29:50.387
There's nothing to figure out.
This man is obviously a psychotic.

29:50.457 --> 29:55.555
I'd like to hold off judgment
until all the facts are in.

29:55.630 --> 30:00.226
General Turgidson, when you instituted
the human reliability tests...

30:00.301 --> 30:04.238
you assured me there was no possibility
of such a thing ever occurring.

30:06.208 --> 30:10.270
Well, I don't think it's fair
to condemn a whole program...

30:10.347 --> 30:13.009
because of a single slipup, sir.

30:13.083 --> 30:15.608
I want to speak to General Ripper
on the telephone.

30:15.685 --> 30:17.210
That's impossible.

30:17.288 --> 30:21.190
General Turgidson, I am becoming
less and less interested...

30:21.258 --> 30:24.820
in your estimates
of what is possible and impossible.

30:25.998 --> 30:27.431
General Faceman.

30:27.499 --> 30:28.659
Yes, sir?

30:28.734 --> 30:31.101
Are there any army units
stationed near Burpelson?

30:31.170 --> 30:33.229
I'll just check, sir.

30:38.078 --> 30:39.511
Hello?

30:41.081 --> 30:44.312
I told you never to call me here.
Don't you know where I am?

30:46.721 --> 30:49.383
Look, baby, I can't talk to you now.

30:49.457 --> 30:52.017
My president needs me.

30:52.094 --> 30:55.723
Of course Bucky would rather
be there with you.

30:56.799 --> 30:59.963
Of course it isn't only physical.

31:00.037 --> 31:02.505
I deeply respect you
as a human being.

31:02.572 --> 31:05.666
Someday I'm going to make you
Mrs. Buck Turgidson.

31:06.844 --> 31:09.779
Oh, listen, you go back to sleep.

31:09.847 --> 31:12.816
Bucky will be there as soon as he can.

31:12.884 --> 31:17.481
All right. Listen, don't forget
to say your prayers.

31:24.497 --> 31:28.434
Apparently,
the 23rd Airborne Division...

31:28.502 --> 31:31.335
is stationed seven miles away
at Alvarado.

31:31.405 --> 31:35.672
General Faceman, I want them to enter
the base, locate General Ripper...

31:35.744 --> 31:38.110
and put him in immediate
telephone contact with me.

31:38.180 --> 31:39.807
Yes, sir.

31:39.881 --> 31:41.542
Mr. President?

31:41.616 --> 31:43.209
If I may advise.

31:43.286 --> 31:47.552
Under a condition red, it is standard
procedure that the base be sealed off...

31:47.623 --> 31:50.388
and the base defended
by base security troops.

31:50.461 --> 31:54.898
Any force trying to enter would
certainly encounter heavy casualties.

31:54.965 --> 31:59.027
General Turgidson, with all due respect
for your defense team...

31:59.104 --> 32:01.834
my boys can brush them aside
without too much trouble.

32:02.774 --> 32:07.542
Mr. President, there are one or two
points I'd like to make, if I may?

32:08.581 --> 32:10.014
Go ahead, General.

32:11.518 --> 32:16.182
One: Our hopes for recalling
the 843rd Bomb Wing...

32:16.256 --> 32:20.557
are quickly being reduced
to a very low order of probability.

32:20.628 --> 32:23.654
Two: In less than 15 minutes
from now...

32:23.731 --> 32:26.724
the Ruskies will be making
radar contact with the planes.

32:26.802 --> 32:28.793
Three: When they do...

32:28.871 --> 32:32.501
they will go absolutely ape and
strike back with everything they've got.

32:32.575 --> 32:36.477
Four: If prior to this time...

32:36.546 --> 32:40.005
we have done nothing to suppress
their retaliatory capabilities...

32:40.084 --> 32:43.747
we will suffer virtual annihilation.

32:46.825 --> 32:51.489
Five: Lf, on the other hand...

32:53.365 --> 32:58.702
we immediately launched an attack
on their airfields and missile bases...

32:58.771 --> 33:01.969
we'd stand a damn good chance
of catching them with their pants down.

33:02.042 --> 33:04.408
Hell, we've got
a five-to-one missile superiority.

33:04.478 --> 33:07.242
We could easily assign three missiles
to every target...

33:07.314 --> 33:10.716
and still have a very effective reserve
force for any other contingency.

33:10.785 --> 33:16.156
Six: An unofficial study which
we undertook of this eventuality...

33:16.225 --> 33:21.162
indicated that we would destroy
90% of their nuclear capabilities.

33:21.230 --> 33:23.358
We would therefore prevail...

33:23.433 --> 33:26.630
and suffer only modest and acceptable
civilian casualties...

33:26.703 --> 33:31.141
from their remaining force which would
be badly damaged and uncoordinated.

33:31.209 --> 33:34.667
General, it is the avowed policy
of our country...

33:34.745 --> 33:36.906
never to strike first
with nuclear weapons.

33:36.982 --> 33:41.681
Well, Mr. President, General Ripper
has already invalidated that policy.

33:41.753 --> 33:46.191
That was not an act of national policy.
There are still alternatives open to us.

33:47.193 --> 33:52.029
Mr. President, we are rapidly
approaching a moment of truth...

33:52.099 --> 33:55.262
both for ourselves as human beings
and for the life of our nation.

33:55.336 --> 33:57.964
Truth is not always a pleasant thing.

33:58.038 --> 34:00.599
But it is necessary now
to make a choice:

34:00.675 --> 34:03.439
To choose between two admittedly
regrettable...

34:03.511 --> 34:06.970
but nevertheless distinguishable
postwar environments.

34:07.049 --> 34:11.850
One, where 20 million people are killed;
the other, 150 people killed.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.891
You're talking about mass murder,
General, not war.

34:14.958 --> 34:18.553
Mr. President, I'm not saying
we wouldn't get our hair mussed.

34:18.629 --> 34:23.260
But I do say no more than
10 to 20 million killed. Tops!

34:23.333 --> 34:25.324
Depending on the breaks.

34:25.402 --> 34:29.397
I will not go down in history as
the greatest mass murderer since Hitler!

34:29.475 --> 34:32.069
It might be better
if you were more concerned...

34:32.143 --> 34:35.478
with the American people than
with your image in the history books.

34:35.547 --> 34:38.574
General Turgidson,
I've heard quite sufficient from you.

34:38.652 --> 34:41.052
Thank you very much.

34:41.121 --> 34:43.681
Mr. President, they have
the ambassador waiting upstairs.

34:43.757 --> 34:47.387
- Good. Any difficulty?
- He's having a fit about the M.P.s.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.929
That can't be helped.
Have him brought here straightaway.

34:49.998 --> 34:51.556
Yes, sir.

34:51.632 --> 34:54.158
Is that the Russian ambassador?

34:54.235 --> 34:56.330
Yes, it is, General.

34:58.441 --> 35:01.410
Am I to understand
the Russian ambassador...

35:01.477 --> 35:03.844
is to be admitted entrance
to the War Room?

35:03.914 --> 35:06.781
That is correct.
He is here on my orders.

35:09.687 --> 35:11.883
I don't know exactly how
to put this, sir...

35:11.956 --> 35:15.392
but are you aware of what a breach
of security that would be?

35:15.460 --> 35:19.625
He'll see everything.
He'll see the big board.

35:20.566 --> 35:22.898
That is precisely the idea, General.

35:22.968 --> 35:25.199
That is precisely the idea.

35:26.740 --> 35:30.642
Staines, get Premier Kissoff
on the hot line.

35:37.785 --> 35:41.688
<i>"Survival kit contents check.</i>

35:41.757 --> 35:46.695
<i>In them you will find
one.45 caliber automatic...</i>

35:46.763 --> 35:49.254
<i>two boxes of ammunition...</i>

35:49.332 --> 35:52.597
<i>four days concentrated
emergency rations...</i>

35:52.669 --> 35:56.003
one drug issue
containing antibiotics...

35:56.073 --> 36:00.408
morphine, vitamin pills,
pep pills...

36:00.479 --> 36:04.279
<i>sleeping pills,
tranquilizer pills...</i>

36:04.349 --> 36:09.185
<i>one miniature combination
Russian phrase book and Bible...</i>

36:09.255 --> 36:12.281
<i>$ 100 in rubles...</i>

36:12.358 --> 36:14.485
<i>$ 100 in gold...</i>

36:14.560 --> 36:17.325
<i>nine packs of chewing gum...</i>

36:17.398 --> 36:19.332
one issue of prophylactics...

36:19.400 --> 36:23.428
three lipsticks,
three pair of nylon stockings."

36:23.505 --> 36:28.238
Shoot, a fellow could have a pretty
good weekend in Vegas with that stuff.

36:33.749 --> 36:36.617
- You don't have any fresh fish?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

36:36.686 --> 36:38.881
- Your eggs are fresh?
- Yes, sir.

36:38.955 --> 36:42.914
I will have poached eggs. And bring me
some cigars, please. Havana cigars.

36:42.993 --> 36:46.395
That will be all, sir?
I'll see to it right away.

36:46.464 --> 36:49.661
Try one of theseJamaican cigars,
Ambassador. They're good.

36:49.734 --> 36:53.193
Thank you, no. I do not support the work
of imperialist stooges.

36:53.272 --> 36:55.866
Oh, only Commie stooges, huh?

36:55.941 --> 36:57.499
Mr. President.

36:59.379 --> 37:02.678
You're gonna let that lousy Commie punk
vomit all over us like this?

37:02.749 --> 37:03.841
Mr. President?

37:03.917 --> 37:07.684
They haven't reached Premier Kissoff.
They don't know where he is...

37:07.755 --> 37:10.155
and he won't be back for two hours.

37:11.225 --> 37:13.717
Try B-8-6-5-4-3 Moscow.

37:13.795 --> 37:15.888
You would never have found him
through his office.

37:15.964 --> 37:19.992
Our premier is a man of the people,
but he is also a man, if you follow.

37:20.069 --> 37:22.765
- Degenerate atheistic Commie.
- What did you say?

37:22.839 --> 37:26.401
I said Premier Kissoff is
a degenerate atheistic Commie!

37:26.477 --> 37:29.412
- Have this ignorant fool...
- I'm sorry!

37:29.480 --> 37:33.416
Mr. President,
I think they're trying the number.

37:44.063 --> 37:47.191
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here.
This is the War Room!

37:47.266 --> 37:50.100
What is going on here?
I demand an explanation.

37:50.170 --> 37:54.436
This clumsy fool tried to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

37:54.508 --> 37:57.103
You bet your sweets, Mr. Commie!
Look at this, Mr. President.

37:57.178 --> 38:00.773
This lousy Commie rat was taking
pictures with this of the big board!

38:01.849 --> 38:03.715
Mr. Ambassador!

38:03.785 --> 38:08.051
This clumsy fool attempted to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

38:08.123 --> 38:10.991
That's a damn lie!
I saw him with my own eyes.

38:11.060 --> 38:15.258
This is outrageous. I have never heard
of such behavior in the War Room before.

38:15.331 --> 38:17.823
Mr. President, I think
they're getting him on the line.

38:45.833 --> 38:47.767
You got to hand it to those Commies.

38:47.835 --> 38:52.363
Yeah. Those trucks sure look like
the real thing, don't they?

38:52.441 --> 38:54.375
I wonder where they got them from.

38:54.443 --> 38:56.707
Probably bought them
from the army as war surplus.

39:00.417 --> 39:04.478
Okay, open up at 200 yards.

40:01.719 --> 40:05.383
Tell him where you are and that
you'll speak if I say anything untrue...

40:05.457 --> 40:07.755
but nothing more than that.

40:09.361 --> 40:12.763
Alexi? Alexi, please.
I beg you.

40:13.833 --> 40:16.427
But I don't have a phone.

40:16.503 --> 40:19.064
Give him the phone.

40:45.869 --> 40:50.239
I've done as you asked.
Be careful. I think he is drunk.

40:53.244 --> 40:57.705
Hello? Hello, Dimitri?

40:57.783 --> 41:00.183
Listen, I can't hear too well.

41:00.252 --> 41:03.518
Could you turn the music down
a little?

41:03.590 --> 41:05.524
That's much better.

41:05.592 --> 41:08.220
Yeah. Yeah.

41:09.497 --> 41:12.295
Fine. I can hear you now, Dimitri.

41:12.366 --> 41:15.859
Clear and plain
and coming through fine.

41:15.938 --> 41:20.341
I'm coming through fine, too, eh?
Good.

41:20.409 --> 41:24.369
Well, then, as you say,
we're both coming through fine. Good.

41:24.447 --> 41:26.381
It's good that you're fine...

41:26.449 --> 41:28.713
and I'm fine.

41:28.785 --> 41:32.017
I agree with you.
It's great to be fine.

41:32.923 --> 41:35.118
Now, Dimitri...

41:35.192 --> 41:40.893
you know how we've always talked
about the possibility...

41:40.966 --> 41:43.662
of something going wrong
with the bomb.

41:45.037 --> 41:47.005
The bomb, Dimitri.

41:48.207 --> 41:50.835
The hydrogen bomb.

41:50.910 --> 41:53.880
Well, now, what happened is...

41:53.947 --> 41:58.179
one of our base commanders,
he had a sort of...

41:58.252 --> 42:01.484
Well, he went a little funny
in the head.

42:01.556 --> 42:04.650
You know, just a little funny.

42:04.726 --> 42:08.356
And he went and did a silly thing.

42:09.431 --> 42:11.365
I'll tell you what he did.

42:11.433 --> 42:13.766
He ordered his planes...

42:15.438 --> 42:17.906
to attack your country.

42:17.974 --> 42:20.375
Let me finish, Dimitri.

42:21.379 --> 42:23.347
Let me finish, Dimitri.

42:23.414 --> 42:26.611
Listen, how do you think
I feel about it?

42:26.684 --> 42:29.552
Can you imagine how I feel
about it, Dimitri?

42:31.089 --> 42:33.250
Why do you think I'm calling you?

42:33.325 --> 42:35.351
Just to say hello?

42:36.429 --> 42:38.829
Of course I like to speak to you!

42:38.898 --> 42:41.423
Of course I like to say hello!

42:41.501 --> 42:43.697
Not now, but anytime, Dimitri.

42:43.771 --> 42:47.798
I'm just calling up to tell you
something terrible has happened.

42:47.875 --> 42:50.868
Of course, it's a friendly call.

42:50.946 --> 42:55.212
Listen, if it wasn't friendly,
you probably wouldn't have even got it.

42:57.520 --> 43:02.287
They will not reach their targets
for at least another hour.

43:02.358 --> 43:05.453
I am positive, Dimitri.

43:05.529 --> 43:07.963
I've been all over this
with your ambassador.

43:08.031 --> 43:10.523
It is not a trick.

43:10.602 --> 43:12.069
I'll tell you.

43:12.136 --> 43:15.970
We'd like to give your Air Staff
a complete rundown on the targets...

43:16.040 --> 43:19.306
the flight plans
and defensive systems of the planes.

43:19.378 --> 43:24.315
Yes, if we're unable
to recall the planes...

43:24.383 --> 43:27.046
I'd say, well...

43:28.455 --> 43:32.825
we're just gonna have to help you
destroy them, Dimitri.

43:32.894 --> 43:35.829
I know they're our boys.

43:35.897 --> 43:38.422
Listen. Now, who should we call?

43:40.269 --> 43:44.763
Who should we call?
Sorry, you faded away.

43:45.974 --> 43:49.843
The Peoples Central
Air Defense Headquarters.

43:49.913 --> 43:52.211
Where is that, Dimitri?

43:52.282 --> 43:54.410
In Omsk. Right.

43:55.486 --> 43:56.748
Yes.

43:56.820 --> 43:59.721
You'll call them first, will you?

44:01.226 --> 44:04.161
Do you happen to have the phone number
on you, Dimitri?

44:06.031 --> 44:09.024
What? I see.
Just ask for Omsk information.

44:11.103 --> 44:15.234
I'm sorry too, Dimitri.
I'm very sorry.

44:15.309 --> 44:19.143
All right, you're sorrier than I am.
But I am sorry as well.

44:21.448 --> 44:23.713
I am as sorry as you are, Dimitri.

44:23.785 --> 44:25.753
Don't say that you're more sorry
than I am...

44:25.820 --> 44:28.755
because I'm capable of being
just as sorry as you are.

44:28.823 --> 44:30.758
So we're both sorry, all right?

44:30.826 --> 44:32.259
All right.

44:33.495 --> 44:37.762
Yes, he's right here. Yes, he wants
to talk to you. Just a second.

44:50.314 --> 44:52.010
What?

45:10.704 --> 45:13.572
What? What is it? What?

45:13.641 --> 45:16.667
The fools. The mad fools.

45:18.079 --> 45:20.241
What's happened?

45:20.316 --> 45:22.648
The doomsday machine.

45:22.718 --> 45:25.278
The doomsday machine?
What is that?

45:25.354 --> 45:30.759
A device which will destroy
all human and animal life on Earth.

45:30.827 --> 45:33.091
All human and animal life?

45:47.946 --> 45:50.245
- Mandrake?
- Yes, Jack?

45:51.551 --> 45:55.146
Have you ever seen a Commie
drink a glass of water?

45:55.221 --> 45:59.784
Well, I can't say I have, Jack.

46:00.995 --> 46:05.865
Vodka. That's what they drink,
isn't it? Never water.

46:05.934 --> 46:10.338
I believe that's what they drink, yes.

46:10.406 --> 46:13.864
On no account will a Commie
ever drink water...

46:13.943 --> 46:16.275
and not without good reason.

46:17.347 --> 46:20.009
Oh, yes.

46:20.084 --> 46:25.148
I can't quite see
what you're getting at.

46:26.291 --> 46:29.488
Water. That's what I'm getting at.
Water.

46:31.029 --> 46:34.488
Mandrake, water is the source
of all life.

46:36.035 --> 46:39.631
Seven-tenths of this Earth's surface
is water.

46:39.706 --> 46:43.039
Why, do you realize that...

46:43.110 --> 46:46.171
70% of you is water?

46:46.247 --> 46:47.680
Good Lord.

46:47.748 --> 46:52.880
And as human beings,
you and I need fresh, pure water...

46:52.955 --> 46:56.550
to replenish
our precious bodily fluids.

46:56.625 --> 46:59.355
- You beginning to understand?
- Yes.

47:06.703 --> 47:11.971
Have you never wondered why I drink
only distilled water...

47:12.042 --> 47:16.446
or rainwater,
and only pure grain alcohol?

47:16.515 --> 47:19.814
It did occur to me, Jack, yes.

47:20.919 --> 47:24.879
Have you ever heard of fluoridation
of water?

47:25.958 --> 47:29.793
Yes, I have heard of that, Jack, yes.

47:29.863 --> 47:31.797
Do you know what it is?

47:31.865 --> 47:34.993
No, no, I don't know what it is.

47:35.068 --> 47:39.005
Do you realize that fluoridation...

47:39.073 --> 47:41.906
is the most monstrously conceived...

47:41.976 --> 47:44.775
and dangerous Communist plot
we have ever had to face?

47:51.188 --> 47:53.156
Two can play at that game, soldier.

47:58.262 --> 48:00.992
That's nice shooting, soldier!

48:25.459 --> 48:27.519
Mandrake, come here.

48:27.596 --> 48:29.621
You calling me, Jack?

48:29.698 --> 48:32.132
Come over here
and help me with this belt.

48:35.171 --> 48:38.163
I haven't had very much experience...

48:38.241 --> 48:41.040
with those sort of machines.

48:41.111 --> 48:44.911
I've only ever pressed a button
in my old Spitfire.

48:44.982 --> 48:48.612
In the name of Her Majesty and the
Continental Congress, feed me this belt.

48:48.686 --> 48:53.453
Jack, I'd love to come,
but what's happened, you see...

48:53.524 --> 48:56.323
the string in my leg is gone.

48:57.396 --> 49:01.196
- The what?
- The string. I never told you.

49:01.267 --> 49:05.170
I've got a gammy leg.
Oh, dear. Gone. Shot off.

49:07.307 --> 49:10.971
Mandrake, come over here.
The redcoats are coming.

49:12.079 --> 49:16.244
When it is detonated, it will produce
enough radioactive fallout...

49:16.318 --> 49:18.252
so that in ten months...

49:18.320 --> 49:21.414
the surface of the Earth
will be as dead as the moon!

49:21.490 --> 49:24.460
Come on, De Sadesky!
That's ridiculous!

49:24.527 --> 49:28.657
Our studies show even the worst fallout
is down to a safe level after two weeks.

49:28.731 --> 49:33.760
- You never heard of cobalt theoium G.
- What about it?

49:33.837 --> 49:37.934
Cobalt thorium G has
a radioactive half-life of 93 years.

49:38.009 --> 49:41.103
If you take 50 H bombs
in the 100 megaton range...

49:41.179 --> 49:43.579
and jacket them
with cobalt thorium G...

49:43.648 --> 49:48.279
when they are exploded,
they will produce a doomsday shroud...

49:48.354 --> 49:50.652
a lethal cloud of radioactivity...

49:50.723 --> 49:55.161
which will encircle the Earth
for 93 years!

49:55.228 --> 49:58.789
What a load of Commie bull.
I mean, after all.

49:59.867 --> 50:02.529
I'm afraid I don't understand
something, Alexi.

50:02.603 --> 50:06.232
Is the premier threatening to explode it
if our planes carry out their attack?

50:06.308 --> 50:08.868
No, sir. It is not a thing
a sane man would do.

50:08.944 --> 50:11.879
The doomsday machine is designed
to trigger itself automatically.

50:11.947 --> 50:14.212
Surely you can disarm it somehow.

50:14.284 --> 50:18.220
It is designed to explode if
any attempt is made to un-trigger it.

50:18.288 --> 50:19.550
Automatically?

50:19.622 --> 50:22.217
It's a Commie trick!
We're wasting valuable time!

50:22.293 --> 50:25.387
Look at the big board!
They're getting ready to clobber us!

50:25.463 --> 50:30.128
This is absolute madness.
Why should you build such a thing?

50:30.202 --> 50:32.170
There are those of us
who fought against it.

50:32.237 --> 50:34.296
But in the end, we could not keep up
with the expense involved...

50:34.373 --> 50:38.902
in the arms race, the space race
and the peace race.

50:38.978 --> 50:44.212
At the same time, our people grumbled
for more nylons and washing machines.

50:44.284 --> 50:46.844
Our doomsday scheme cost us
just a small fraction...

50:46.920 --> 50:50.152
of what we have been spending on defense
in a single year.

50:50.225 --> 50:54.662
The deciding factor was when we learned
your country was working similarly...

50:54.729 --> 50:56.664
and we were afraid of a doomsday gap!

50:56.732 --> 51:00.099
This is preposterous! I've never
approved of anything like that.

51:00.169 --> 51:03.002
<i>Our source was The New York Times.</i>

51:03.072 --> 51:06.975
Dr. Strangelove, do we have anything
like that in the works?

51:07.043 --> 51:09.511
A moment, please, Mr. President.

51:12.250 --> 51:15.686
Under the authority granted me...

51:15.753 --> 51:19.918
as director of weapons research
and development...

51:19.992 --> 51:24.190
I commissioned last year
a study of this project...

51:24.263 --> 51:26.494
by the Bland Corporation.

51:26.566 --> 51:29.729
Based on the findings of the report...

51:29.803 --> 51:35.299
my conclusion was that this idea
was not a practical deterrent...

51:35.376 --> 51:39.210
for reasons which at this moment
must be all too obvious.

51:39.280 --> 51:42.682
You mean it is possible for them
to have built such a thing?

51:46.856 --> 51:51.725
Mr. President, the technology required
is easily within the means...

51:51.794 --> 51:56.198
of even the smallest nuclear power.

51:56.266 --> 52:00.225
It requires only the will to do so.

52:01.239 --> 52:05.107
But how is it possible for this thing
to be triggered automatically...

52:05.176 --> 52:07.508
and at the same time
impossible to un-trigger?

52:07.579 --> 52:11.607
Mr. President,
it is not only possible...

52:11.684 --> 52:13.618
it is essential.

52:13.686 --> 52:18.124
That is the whole idea
of this machine, you know.

52:18.191 --> 52:23.391
Deterrence is the art of producing
in the mind of the enemy...

52:23.464 --> 52:26.058
the fear of attack.

52:26.133 --> 52:31.071
And so because of the automated and
irrevocable decision-making process...

52:31.139 --> 52:35.041
which rules out human meddling...

52:35.110 --> 52:39.070
the doomsday machine is terrifying...

52:39.148 --> 52:41.241
and simple to understand...

52:41.317 --> 52:45.015
and completely credible
and convincing.

52:45.089 --> 52:48.422
I wish we had one of them
doomsday machines.

52:48.492 --> 52:52.088
But this is fantastic, Strangelove.
How can it be triggered automatically?

52:52.163 --> 52:55.963
It's remarkably simple to do that.

52:56.034 --> 52:59.562
When you merely wish to bury bombs...

52:59.639 --> 53:01.971
there's no limit to the size.

53:02.041 --> 53:04.271
After that, they are connected...

53:04.343 --> 53:08.371
to a gigantic complex of computers.

53:08.448 --> 53:14.183
Now then, a specific and clearly
defined set of circumstances...

53:14.255 --> 53:17.713
under which the bombs
are to be exploded...

53:17.792 --> 53:21.820
is programmed into a tape memory bank.

53:21.897 --> 53:24.991
Hmm. Strangelove?

53:26.068 --> 53:29.129
What kind of a name is that?
That ain't no Kraut name, is it?

53:29.205 --> 53:31.503
He changed it when he became a citizen.

53:31.575 --> 53:34.568
It used to be Merkwurdichliebe.

53:34.645 --> 53:39.014
Well, a Kraut by any other name,
uh, Stainsey?

53:40.918 --> 53:45.288
The whole point of
the doomsday machine...

53:45.357 --> 53:48.919
is lost if you keep it a secret!

53:48.995 --> 53:51.156
Why didn't you tell the world?

53:51.230 --> 53:55.633
It was to be announced
at the Party Congress on Monday.

53:55.703 --> 53:59.036
As you know,
the premier loves surprises.

54:47.528 --> 54:49.758
Stay with me, Mandrake.

54:54.936 --> 54:57.632
All right, now feed me.
Feed me, boy.

55:27.506 --> 55:32.570
Don't you think we'd be better off
away from this flying glass?

55:32.646 --> 55:34.705
We're okay here.

55:36.350 --> 55:40.377
Mandrake, do you realize that
in addition to fluoridating the water...

55:40.455 --> 55:44.017
there are studies underway
to fluoridate salt, flour...

55:44.093 --> 55:49.121
fruit juices, soup, sugar,
milk, ice cream?

55:49.198 --> 55:50.461
Ice cream.

55:50.533 --> 55:52.967
- Children's ice cream.
- Good Lord.

55:53.036 --> 55:55.470
You know when fluoridation
first began?

55:56.506 --> 55:58.441
No, I don't, Jack.

55:58.509 --> 56:00.977
1946.

56:01.045 --> 56:03.809
1946, Mandrake.

56:03.881 --> 56:08.182
How does that coincide with
your postwar Commie conspiracy, huh?

56:08.253 --> 56:11.552
It's incredibly obvious, isn't it?

56:11.623 --> 56:17.153
A foreign substance is introduced
into our precious bodily fluids...

56:17.230 --> 56:20.496
without the knowledge
of the individual.

56:20.567 --> 56:22.501
Certainly without any choice.

56:24.304 --> 56:27.604
That's the way a hard-core Commie works.

56:29.043 --> 56:32.274
Jack. Tell me, Jack.

56:32.347 --> 56:35.010
When did you first become...

56:35.084 --> 56:37.848
Well, develop this theory?

56:38.954 --> 56:41.185
Well, l...

56:41.258 --> 56:44.819
I first became aware of it, Mandrake...

56:44.895 --> 56:46.886
during the physical act of love.

56:48.666 --> 56:52.932
Yes, a profound sense of fatigue...

56:53.004 --> 56:55.565
feeling of emptiness followed.

56:55.641 --> 56:59.407
Luckily I was able to interpret
these feelings correctly.

57:00.813 --> 57:02.441
Loss of essence.

57:04.083 --> 57:07.814
I can assure you it has not recurred,
Mandrake.

57:07.887 --> 57:10.823
Women sense my power...

57:12.059 --> 57:14.186
and they seek the life essence.

57:15.462 --> 57:18.796
I do not avoid women, Mandrake.

57:18.867 --> 57:21.768
But I do deny them my essence.

57:21.837 --> 57:24.705
Yes, yes, Jack.

57:37.354 --> 57:39.482
Cease fire!

58:00.781 --> 58:02.476
My boys must have surrendered.

58:02.550 --> 58:04.882
There it is.

58:04.952 --> 58:06.784
Jack, listen.

58:06.855 --> 58:10.188
While there's still time, I beg you,
let's recall the Wing and...

58:12.327 --> 58:15.161
Those boys were like my children.

58:16.733 --> 58:18.792
Now they let me down.

58:18.868 --> 58:20.563
No, not a bit.

58:20.637 --> 58:23.436
I'm sure they all gave it
their very best.

58:23.507 --> 58:25.998
I'm equally sure they all died
thinking of you...

58:26.076 --> 58:28.807
every man jack of them, Jack.

58:28.880 --> 58:31.542
Supposing a bit of water
has gone off, eh?

58:31.616 --> 58:33.914
Certainly one can never be too sure
about those things.

58:33.985 --> 58:36.955
But look at me.
Do I look all rancid and clotted?

58:37.023 --> 58:39.821
Look at me, Jack. Look.

58:39.892 --> 58:43.989
And I drink a lot of water.
I'm what you might call a water man.

58:44.064 --> 58:47.431
And I can swear to you, my boy,
swear to you...

58:47.501 --> 58:49.766
that there's nothing wrong
with my bodily fluids.

58:49.837 --> 58:52.328
Not a thing, Jackie.

58:52.407 --> 58:54.705
Mandrake, were you ever
a prisoner of war?

58:54.776 --> 58:58.440
Well, Jack, the time's running very...

58:58.514 --> 59:01.574
- What?
- Were you ever a prisoner of war?

59:01.650 --> 59:03.743
Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.

59:03.819 --> 59:06.914
Did they torture you?

59:06.990 --> 59:10.016
Yes, they did.
I was tortured by theJapanese.

59:10.093 --> 59:11.755
Not a pretty story.

59:11.829 --> 59:13.421
What happened?

59:13.497 --> 59:17.797
I don't know, Jack. It's difficult
to think under these conditions.

59:17.868 --> 59:20.099
Well, what happened was...

59:20.172 --> 59:23.573
they got me on the old
Rangoon-Inchinawa Railway.

59:23.642 --> 59:28.012
I was laying train lines
for the bloodyJapanese puff-puffs.

59:28.081 --> 59:31.312
No, I mean, when they tortured you,
did you talk?

59:33.053 --> 59:35.044
No, l...

59:35.122 --> 59:39.388
Well, I don't think they wanted me
to talk, really, or say anything.

59:39.460 --> 59:42.555
It was their way of having
a bit of fun, the swine.

59:42.630 --> 59:45.963
The strange thing is,
they make such bloody good cameras.

59:47.703 --> 59:53.335
Those clowns outside will give me
a good going-over soon for the code.

59:56.346 --> 59:59.713
Yes, you may have quite a point
there, Jack.

01:00:00.817 --> 01:00:03.810
I don't know how well
I could stand up under torture.

01:00:03.888 --> 01:00:07.153
The answer to that is,
no one ever does.

01:00:07.225 --> 01:00:11.356
And my advise to you
is to give me the code now.

01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:14.331
If those devils come back
and try any rough stuff...

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:17.666
we'll fight them together
like we did just now on the floor.

01:00:17.737 --> 01:00:21.264
You with your gun and me
with a belt of ammo, feeding you.

01:00:21.341 --> 01:00:24.140
"Feed me," you said,
and I was feeding you, Jack.

01:00:24.211 --> 01:00:26.873
You know, Mandrake...

01:00:26.947 --> 01:00:30.179
I happen to believe in
a life after this one...

01:00:31.686 --> 01:00:35.122
and I know I'll have to answer
for what I've done.

01:00:36.958 --> 01:00:38.426
And I think I can.

01:00:38.494 --> 01:00:41.725
Yes, of course you can.
Of course you can. You can.

01:00:41.798 --> 01:00:44.232
I'm a religious man myself,
you know.

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:48.169
I believe in all that sort of thing
and I'm hoping, you know, Jack...

01:00:48.238 --> 01:00:51.105
You've dropped your gun, Jack.

01:00:51.175 --> 01:00:54.771
No, Jack, let me take that for you.

01:00:54.846 --> 01:00:58.338
You know what I'm hoping? I'm hoping
you're going to give me the code, boy.

01:01:00.119 --> 01:01:02.747
You're going to wash and brush up?
What a good idea.

01:01:02.822 --> 01:01:05.416
Always did wonders for a man,
a wash and brush up.

01:01:05.491 --> 01:01:08.256
Water on the back of the neck
makes you feel marvelous.

01:01:08.328 --> 01:01:11.092
That's what we need: Water on
the back of the neck and the code.

01:01:11.164 --> 01:01:14.760
Supposing I play a little guessing game
with you, Jack boy?

01:01:14.836 --> 01:01:17.828
I'll try and guess
what the code is...

01:01:34.324 --> 01:01:38.819
Copilot to navigator.
I'm ready with the fuel figures now.

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:41.866
We have 109,000 total...

01:01:41.933 --> 01:01:44.766
<i>79,000 in the mains...</i>

01:01:44.836 --> 01:01:47.634
<i>and 30,000 in the auxiliaries.</i>

01:01:47.706 --> 01:01:49.641
<i>And that works out
to roughly...</i>

01:01:49.709 --> 01:01:53.167
<i>seven hours, 15 minutes
endurance from this time.</i>

01:01:54.313 --> 01:01:55.746
D.S.O. To Captain.

01:01:55.815 --> 01:01:58.910
I have an unidentified
radar blip.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.914
Distance: 60 miles.

01:02:04.092 --> 01:02:07.255
Approximate speed:
Mach three.

01:02:07.328 --> 01:02:09.262
Looks like
a missile tracking us.

01:02:12.201 --> 01:02:14.260
Confirmed:
Definite missile track.

01:02:14.336 --> 01:02:16.395
<i>Commence evasive action right.</i>

01:02:22.646 --> 01:02:26.310
<i>Missile still closing range.</i>

01:02:26.384 --> 01:02:30.377
Distance: 50 miles.
Continue evasive action.

01:02:30.454 --> 01:02:33.185
Lock E.C.M. To target intercept mode.

01:02:33.258 --> 01:02:36.887
E.C.M. Locked to
target intercept mode.

01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:39.397
Missile still tracking
and closing distance.

01:02:39.465 --> 01:02:43.458
Range: 40 miles.
Continue evasive action.

01:02:46.373 --> 01:02:50.639
<i>Electronic Guidance Scrambler
to blue grid.</i>

01:02:50.711 --> 01:02:54.204
<i>Missile still tracking steady
and closing distance.</i>

01:02:54.282 --> 01:02:56.216
Range: 30 miles.

01:02:58.486 --> 01:03:02.719
<i>Missile still closing true and steady.
Continue evasive action.</i>

01:03:10.267 --> 01:03:12.258
Range: 20 miles.

01:03:12.336 --> 01:03:16.205
<i>Missile still closing distance
and tracking steady.</i>

01:03:16.274 --> 01:03:18.708
Attack range gate
on maximum scan.

01:03:18.776 --> 01:03:21.210
Range gate on maximum scan.

01:03:21.279 --> 01:03:24.147
Range: 10 miles.

01:03:24.216 --> 01:03:28.175
Missile track deflecting.
Continue evasive action.

01:03:28.254 --> 01:03:31.520
Deflection increasing.
Range: Eight miles.

01:03:31.591 --> 01:03:35.527
Deflection still increasing.
Range: Six miles.

01:03:35.595 --> 01:03:38.292
Missile still deflecting.
Range: Four miles.

01:03:44.106 --> 01:03:47.303
Range: Two miles.
Missile still deflecting.

01:03:47.376 --> 01:03:49.640
Range: One mile.
Missile detonated!

01:03:56.319 --> 01:03:58.413
- Start lever to cut off!
- Cut off!

01:04:01.825 --> 01:04:03.258
We're losin' power!

01:04:11.703 --> 01:04:14.036
Re-select essential power!

01:04:14.106 --> 01:04:16.131
Essential power re-selected.

01:04:22.749 --> 01:04:24.683
The hatch is stuck!

01:04:28.256 --> 01:04:29.689
Hit emergency power!

01:04:32.193 --> 01:04:35.027
- Extinguishers!
- Roger!

01:04:41.771 --> 01:04:45.036
- Transfer switches!
- Transferred!

01:04:45.108 --> 01:04:47.372
- Boost pumps off!
- Cut off!

01:04:59.124 --> 01:05:01.115
Fuel valves three, four and six!

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.073
Give me full power!

01:05:27.957 --> 01:05:30.551
Peace on Earth.

01:05:35.198 --> 01:05:37.894
P.O.E.

01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:40.836
Purity of Essence.

01:05:40.905 --> 01:05:44.432
O.P.O.E.

01:05:55.588 --> 01:05:57.920
Put your hands over your head.

01:05:57.991 --> 01:06:00.620
What do you think you're doing?
Who are you?

01:06:00.694 --> 01:06:02.559
Put your hands over your head.

01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:06.225
What kind of suit
do you call that, fella?

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:08.292
What do you mean, suit?

01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:10.804
This happens to be
an R.A.F. Uniform...

01:06:10.872 --> 01:06:15.207
and I am Group Captain Lionel Mandrake,
General Ripper's executive officer.

01:06:15.278 --> 01:06:16.802
Where's General Ripper?

01:06:16.879 --> 01:06:19.712
He's dead, in the bathroom.

01:06:19.782 --> 01:06:21.944
Where's the bathroom?

01:06:22.019 --> 01:06:23.452
Next to you.

01:06:32.931 --> 01:06:35.662
I don't know what stupid game
this is you're playing...

01:06:35.734 --> 01:06:37.861
but I've got a good idea
what the recall code is...

01:06:37.937 --> 01:06:40.462
and I have to get in touch
with SAC headquarters immediately!

01:06:40.539 --> 01:06:44.237
Put your hands over your head
and keep 'em there! Go on.

01:06:44.311 --> 01:06:46.006
Got any witnesses?

01:06:46.079 --> 01:06:48.013
What are you talking about?
He shot himself!

01:06:48.081 --> 01:06:50.107
While he was shavin'?

01:06:50.184 --> 01:06:53.347
Now look, Colonel Bat Guano...

01:06:53.421 --> 01:06:55.889
if that really is your name...

01:06:55.957 --> 01:06:59.826
may I tell you that I have
a very good idea...

01:06:59.895 --> 01:07:02.921
I think, hope, pray...
what the recall code is.

01:07:02.998 --> 01:07:05.729
It's some theme he kept repeating.
A variation on...

01:07:05.802 --> 01:07:09.033
"Peace on Earth" or "Purity of Essence,"
one of those.

01:07:09.105 --> 01:07:12.940
Put your hands on top of your head.
Start walkin'.

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:16.241
Don't you know that General Ripper
went mad...

01:07:16.313 --> 01:07:19.715
and sent the whole Wing
to attack the Soviets?

01:07:19.784 --> 01:07:23.311
- What are you talkin' about?
- I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

01:07:23.388 --> 01:07:27.485
I'm going to pick up this red telephone,
which is connected to SAC...

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.993
and I hope...

01:07:30.530 --> 01:07:32.691
Blast. Blast.

01:07:32.765 --> 01:07:36.759
Shot away, I expect, by one of your men
during this ridiculous fighting!

01:07:38.205 --> 01:07:40.231
Right.

01:07:40.308 --> 01:07:43.709
All right, Charlie, I've been
wastin' too much time on you.

01:07:43.778 --> 01:07:47.579
I got a lot of wounded men outside.
Start walkin'.

01:08:09.875 --> 01:08:13.709
All the radio gear is out,
including the C.R.M. 114.

01:08:13.779 --> 01:08:16.943
I think the auto-destruct mechanism
got hit and blew itself up.

01:08:21.453 --> 01:08:24.685
The fire is out.
The emergency power is on.

01:08:24.758 --> 01:08:28.250
Everything checks out all right.
Will advise.

01:08:28.328 --> 01:08:30.058
Roger. Navigator?

01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:35.591
I've worked out our rate of fuel loss
at approximately 1-6-2 per minute.

01:08:35.670 --> 01:08:38.469
<i>This gives us a radius of action
sufficient to take out...</i>

01:08:38.541 --> 01:08:41.908
<i>primary and secondary targets,
but we will not...</i>

01:08:41.978 --> 01:08:46.143
repeat, not be able to make it back
to any base or neutral country.

01:08:47.084 --> 01:08:49.644
<i>However, we would have
enough fuel to ditch...</i>

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:52.451
<i>at weather ship Tango Delta...</i>

01:08:52.523 --> 01:08:55.787
<i>grid coordinates 0-0-3-6-9-1.</i>

01:09:00.566 --> 01:09:03.000
Well, boys,
we got three engines out.

01:09:03.068 --> 01:09:06.868
We got more holes in us
than a horse trader's mule.

01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:08.965
The radio is gone,
and we're leakin' fuel.

01:09:09.042 --> 01:09:12.478
And if we was flyin' any lower,
we'd need sleigh bells on this thing.

01:09:12.545 --> 01:09:15.537
But we got one little budge
on them Ruskies.

01:09:15.616 --> 01:09:17.550
At this height
they might harpoon us...

01:09:17.618 --> 01:09:20.712
but they sure ain't gonna spot us
on no radar screen.

01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:33.835
The other way.

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:36.304
- Where are you taking me?
- To the main gate.

01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:41.832
Colonel, I must know what you think
has been going on here.

01:09:41.912 --> 01:09:43.846
- You wanna know what I think?
- Yes.

01:09:43.915 --> 01:09:46.611
I think you're some kind
of deviated "prevert."

01:09:46.685 --> 01:09:49.416
I think General Ripper found out
about your "preversion"...

01:09:49.488 --> 01:09:51.786
and that you were organizing
some kind of mutiny of"preverts."

01:09:51.857 --> 01:09:54.256
Now, move!

01:09:54.326 --> 01:09:57.660
On top of that, I don't know anything
about any planes attacking Russia.

01:09:57.731 --> 01:10:01.531
I was told to get Ripper on the phone
with the President of the United States.

01:10:01.601 --> 01:10:06.369
Now just one second.
You just said "the president."

01:10:06.441 --> 01:10:08.671
What about the president?

01:10:08.743 --> 01:10:11.907
The president wants to speak
to General Ripper, doesn't he?

01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:14.574
Now, General Ripper is dead,
is he not?

01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:16.880
I am General Ripper's
executive officer...

01:10:16.952 --> 01:10:19.922
so the president will want
to speak to me, won't he?

01:10:19.989 --> 01:10:23.720
There's a telephone box over there
and the line may be open.

01:10:23.793 --> 01:10:26.592
You wanna talk to
the President of the United States?

01:10:26.664 --> 01:10:29.531
I don't want to talk to him, Colonel,
I've got to talk to him.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.264
And if you don't put that gun away
and stop this stupid nonsense...

01:10:33.338 --> 01:10:37.365
the Court of Inquiry on this
will give you such a pranging...

01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:41.539
you'll be lucky to end up wearing the
uniform of a bloody toilet attendant!

01:10:46.352 --> 01:10:49.982
Go ahead, try and get the President
of the United States on the phone.

01:10:52.659 --> 01:10:54.719
Try any "preversions,"
I'll blow your head off.

01:11:09.346 --> 01:11:12.179
Operator? This is
Group Captain Lionel Mandrake.

01:11:12.249 --> 01:11:14.308
I'm speaking from
Burpelson Air Force Base.

01:11:14.384 --> 01:11:18.287
Something urgent has come up and I want
you to place a person-to-person call...

01:11:18.356 --> 01:11:21.450
with President Merkin Muffley
in the Pentagon, Washington, D.C.

01:11:22.828 --> 01:11:26.025
<i>Burpelson 3-9-1-8-0.</i>

01:11:27.232 --> 01:11:32.296
No, I'm perfectly serious.
The President of the United States.

01:11:32.372 --> 01:11:35.273
I'm sorry,
I haven't got enough change.

01:11:35.341 --> 01:11:38.778
Could you make this
a collect call, Operator?

01:11:50.725 --> 01:11:54.355
Just one second, Operator.
They won't accept the call.

01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:56.330
Have you got 55 cents?

01:11:56.399 --> 01:11:59.426
Do you think I'd go into combat
with loose change in my pocket?

01:12:01.805 --> 01:12:04.706
Operator, look.

01:12:04.775 --> 01:12:08.268
Is it possible to make this
an ordinary trunk call?

01:12:08.346 --> 01:12:11.110
Well, what do you call it?
You know...

01:12:11.182 --> 01:12:14.175
Oh, station-to-station.

01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:21.783
Oh, blast!
I'm still 20 cents short.

01:12:23.663 --> 01:12:27.100
Operator, hold on.
I shan't keep you a second.

01:12:27.168 --> 01:12:31.332
Colonel, that Coca-Cola machine.
I want you to shoot the lock off it.

01:12:31.405 --> 01:12:33.464
There may be change in there.

01:12:37.012 --> 01:12:38.479
That's private property.

01:12:38.547 --> 01:12:41.483
Can you possibly imagine
what is going to happen to you...

01:12:41.551 --> 01:12:44.247
your frame outlook,
way of life and everything...

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:48.849
when they learn you have obstructed
a phone call to the president?

01:12:48.926 --> 01:12:52.919
Can you imagine?
Shoot it off!

01:12:52.997 --> 01:12:56.627
Shoot with the gun! That's what
the bullets are for, you twit!

01:12:56.701 --> 01:13:00.159
Okay, I'm gonna get
your money for you.

01:13:00.238 --> 01:13:04.369
But if you don't get the president on
the phone, you know what's gonna happen?

01:13:04.443 --> 01:13:08.038
You're gonna have to answer
to the Coca-Cola Company.

01:13:17.358 --> 01:13:20.293
<i>This is SAC
Communications Control.</i>

01:13:20.361 --> 01:13:23.762
<i>The recall code O.P. E...</i>

01:13:23.831 --> 01:13:25.766
<i>is being acknowledged "roger"...</i>

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:30.737
<i>by elements of
the 8-4-3 Bomb Wing.</i>

01:13:30.806 --> 01:13:32.798
<i>These are the details.</i>

01:13:32.876 --> 01:13:37.438
<i>Missions 12, 22, 30 and 38...</i>

01:13:37.514 --> 01:13:41.076
<i>are reported destroyed

01:13:41.152 --> 01:13:45.748
<i>All other missions have
acknowledged recall code.</i>

01:13:45.824 --> 01:13:47.758
<i>This is SAC Communications Control.</i>

01:13:47.826 --> 01:13:49.487
<i>Over and out.</i>

01:13:49.561 --> 01:13:51.461
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:53.931
Gentlemen.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.934
Mr. President.

01:13:56.002 --> 01:13:58.095
I'm not a sentimentalist by nature...

01:13:58.171 --> 01:14:01.437
but I think I know what's
in every heart in this room.

01:14:01.508 --> 01:14:05.342
I think we all ought
to bow our heads...

01:14:05.412 --> 01:14:07.472
and give a prayer of thanks
for our deliverance.

01:14:07.549 --> 01:14:08.982
Lord...

01:14:10.218 --> 01:14:14.815
we have heard the wings
of the Angel of Death...

01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:17.757
fluttering over our heads
from the Valley of Fear.

01:14:17.827 --> 01:14:20.489
You have seen fit to deliver us
from the forces of evil...

01:14:20.563 --> 01:14:22.156
Excuse me, sir.

01:14:22.232 --> 01:14:25.360
Premier Kissoff s calling again
and he's hopping mad.

01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:36.047
Fuel flow on active engines
and leakage has increased.

01:14:36.115 --> 01:14:40.142
Now works out at 2-0-5.

01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:43.212
Estimate remaining fuel...

01:14:43.289 --> 01:14:47.191
<i>at 8-7-9-0.</i>

01:14:50.531 --> 01:14:54.399
Roger.
Confirm 2-0-5 per minute...

01:14:54.468 --> 01:14:58.530
<i>and remaining fuel 8-7-9-0.</i>

01:15:05.048 --> 01:15:09.144
No, no, Dimitri,
there must be some mistake.

01:15:09.218 --> 01:15:11.277
No, I'm certain of that.

01:15:11.354 --> 01:15:15.553
I'm perfectly certain
of that, Dimitri.

01:15:15.626 --> 01:15:18.527
Just a second.
You know what he says?

01:15:18.595 --> 01:15:20.860
He says one of the planes
hasn't turned back.

01:15:20.932 --> 01:15:23.526
He says according to information
forwarded by our Air Staffs...

01:15:23.601 --> 01:15:26.537
it's headed for
the missile complex at Laputa.

01:15:29.542 --> 01:15:32.477
That's impossible, Mr. President.

01:15:32.545 --> 01:15:34.605
I mean,
look at the big board.

01:15:34.681 --> 01:15:37.809
Thirty-four planes, 30 recalls
acknowledged and four splashes...

01:15:37.884 --> 01:15:40.752
and one of them
was targeted for Laputa.

01:15:43.691 --> 01:15:46.888
Dimitri, look, we've got
an acknowledgement from every plane...

01:15:46.961 --> 01:15:50.227
except the four you've shot down.

01:15:57.574 --> 01:15:59.974
Hang on a second, Dimitri.

01:16:00.043 --> 01:16:03.377
He says their air defense now only
claims three aircraft confirmed.

01:16:03.447 --> 01:16:05.915
The fourth may only be damaged.

01:16:08.085 --> 01:16:10.020
Mr. President...

01:16:10.088 --> 01:16:12.454
I'm beginnin' to smell
a big, fat Commie rat.

01:16:12.524 --> 01:16:16.393
I mean, supposin' Kissoff is lyin'
about that fourth plane...

01:16:16.462 --> 01:16:18.623
just lookin' for
an excuse to clobber us?

01:16:18.698 --> 01:16:21.132
If the spaghetti hits the fan,
we're in trouble.

01:16:25.239 --> 01:16:27.833
Dimitri, look,
if this report is true...

01:16:27.908 --> 01:16:31.538
and the plane manages
to bomb the target...

01:16:31.613 --> 01:16:35.845
is this gonna set off
the doomsday machine?

01:16:39.088 --> 01:16:41.056
Are you sure?

01:16:42.258 --> 01:16:46.821
Well, I guess you're just gonna have
to get that plane, Dimitri.

01:16:46.897 --> 01:16:49.957
I'm sorry they're jamming
your radar and flying so low...

01:16:50.033 --> 01:16:52.229
but they're trained to do it.

01:16:52.303 --> 01:16:53.964
It's initiative.

01:16:55.673 --> 01:16:58.540
Look, Dimitri, you know
exactly where they're going...

01:16:58.609 --> 01:17:01.773
and I'm sure your entire air defense
can stop a single plane.

01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:09.547
It's not gonna help either one of us
if the doomsday machine goes off, is it?

01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:16.358
There's no point in you getting
hysterical at a moment like this!

01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:20.662
Keep your feet on the ground
when you're talking, Dimitri.

01:17:20.734 --> 01:17:22.999
I am not...
I am not getting...

01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:25.505
No, Dimitri, I'm just worried.

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:27.474
That's all.

01:17:27.542 --> 01:17:30.603
Now look, if our Air Staffs say
its primary target is Laputa...

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.639
and its secondary target is Borchov,
it's true.

01:17:34.717 --> 01:17:36.151
You gotta believe it!

01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:39.951
Dimitri, can I give you
just one word...

01:17:40.023 --> 01:17:43.357
Can I give you just one word
of advice, Dimitri?

01:17:43.428 --> 01:17:45.089
Listen, Dimitri.

01:17:45.163 --> 01:17:48.724
Put everything you've got into
those two sectors, and you can't miss!

01:17:55.107 --> 01:17:58.771
Sir, if we continue to lose fuel
at the present rate...

01:17:58.845 --> 01:18:02.975
I estimate we only have
38 minutes flying time...

01:18:03.049 --> 01:18:05.518
which will not even take us
as far as the primary.

01:18:05.586 --> 01:18:09.522
Doggone it, Sweets, you told me that
you could get me to the primary!

01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:13.425
I'm sorry, sir. That estimate was based
on the original loss rate factor...

01:18:13.495 --> 01:18:15.292
not at 2-0-5.

01:18:15.364 --> 01:18:17.628
I don't give a hoot in hell
how you do it...

01:18:17.699 --> 01:18:19.861
you just get me to
the primary, you hear?

01:18:19.936 --> 01:18:23.372
I'm sorry, sir,
but those are the figures.

01:18:23.439 --> 01:18:26.705
We'll be lucky to reach
weather ship at Tango Delta.

01:18:26.777 --> 01:18:28.972
Well, shoot!

01:18:29.046 --> 01:18:33.381
We ain't come this far just
to dump this thing in the drink.

01:18:33.451 --> 01:18:35.442
What's the nearest
target of opportunity?

01:18:44.230 --> 01:18:46.961
Sir, if the rate of loss
does not increase...

01:18:47.034 --> 01:18:50.800
we have a chance
to reach target 3-8-4...

01:18:50.871 --> 01:18:55.707
grid coordinate 0-0-3-6-9-1...

01:18:55.777 --> 01:18:59.645
and possibly make it from there
to the Tango Delta weather ship.

01:18:59.714 --> 01:19:01.842
What kind of a target
is that, anyhow?

01:19:01.917 --> 01:19:05.853
Sir, that's the I.C.B.M.
Complex at Kotloss.

01:19:05.921 --> 01:19:11.656
All right.
Designating new target: 3-8-4.

01:19:11.728 --> 01:19:14.720
<i>Give me a headin'on that just as soon
as you get it worked out.</i>

01:19:26.912 --> 01:19:31.782
We'll keep our fingers crossed.
Remember, we're all in this together.

01:19:31.851 --> 01:19:35.685
We're right behind you,
we're with you all the way.

01:19:35.755 --> 01:19:39.487
Yes. We'll keep the line open.

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.993
All right, Dimitri.

01:19:43.364 --> 01:19:44.798
General Turgidson...

01:19:44.866 --> 01:19:48.097
is there really a chance
for that plane to get through?

01:19:49.804 --> 01:19:52.239
Mr. President,
if I may speak freely.

01:19:52.308 --> 01:19:55.937
The Ruskie talks big, but frankly
we think he's short of know-how.

01:19:56.011 --> 01:20:00.506
You can't expect ignorant peons
to understand a machine like our boys.

01:20:00.584 --> 01:20:03.018
That's not meant as an insult,
Mr. Ambassador.

01:20:03.086 --> 01:20:05.680
We all know how much guts
the average Ruskie's got.

01:20:05.757 --> 01:20:08.885
Look at all of them Nazis killed
off, and they still wouldn't quit!

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.860
Can't you stick to the point?

01:20:10.928 --> 01:20:14.660
Well, sir,
if the pilot's good, see...

01:20:14.733 --> 01:20:18.897
I mean, if he's really sharp,
he can barrel that baby in so low.

01:20:18.971 --> 01:20:23.466
You oughta see it! It's a sight!
A big plane like a 52! Vroom!

01:20:23.543 --> 01:20:26.603
Its jet exhaust fryin' chickens
in the barnyard!

01:20:26.679 --> 01:20:29.808
- But has he got a chance?
- Has he got a chance?

01:20:29.884 --> 01:20:31.317

01:23:56.352 --> 01:24:00.288
Stay on the bomb run, Ace. I'm goin'
down below and see what I can do.

01:24:13.238 --> 01:24:14.705
Stay on the bomb run.

01:24:14.773 --> 01:24:18.972
I'm gonna get them doors open

01:25:12.538 --> 01:25:15.440

Target in sight!
Where in hell is Major Kong?

01:27:10.139 --> 01:27:11.401
What about Major Kong?

01:27:39.606 --> 01:27:43.303
Mr. President, I would not
rule out the chance...

01:27:43.377 --> 01:27:46.438
to preserve a nucleus
of human specimens.

01:27:46.514 --> 01:27:49.415
It would be quite easy...

01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:56.917
at the bottom of some
of our deeper mine shafts.

01:27:56.992 --> 01:28:01.828
The radioactivity would never penetrate
a mine some thousands of feet deep.

01:28:01.898 --> 01:28:06.165
And in a matter of weeks, sufficient
improvements in dwelling space...

01:28:06.237 --> 01:28:08.171
could easily be provided.

01:28:08.239 --> 01:28:11.003
How long would you have
to stay down there?

01:28:11.075 --> 01:28:14.944
Well, that's, you know...

01:28:15.013 --> 01:28:17.675
Cobalt thorium G.

01:28:27.928 --> 01:28:31.762
Radioactive half-life of...

01:28:33.834 --> 01:28:38.568
I would think that possibly
one hundred years.

01:28:40.909 --> 01:28:44.903
You mean, people could actually
stay down there for 100 years?

01:28:44.981 --> 01:28:47.211
<i>It would not be difficult,
Mein Fuhrer.</i>

01:28:47.283 --> 01:28:49.514
Nuclear reactors could...

01:28:49.586 --> 01:28:51.952
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

01:28:52.022 --> 01:28:55.822
Nuclear reactors could provide
power almost indefinitely.

01:28:55.892 --> 01:28:58.726
Greenhouses could maintain
plant life.

01:28:58.796 --> 01:29:02.391
Animals could be bred
and slaughtered.

01:29:02.467 --> 01:29:06.905
A quick survey would have to be made of
the available mine sites in the country.

01:29:06.972 --> 01:29:10.773
But I would guess
that a dwelling space...

01:29:10.844 --> 01:29:14.507
for several hundred thousand of
our people could easily be provided.

01:29:14.581 --> 01:29:17.709
Well, I would hate
to have to decide...

01:29:17.785 --> 01:29:20.686
who stays up and who goes down.

01:29:20.755 --> 01:29:24.657
Well, that would not be
necessary, Mr. President.

01:29:24.725 --> 01:29:27.593
It could easily be accomplished
with a computer.

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:29.960
And the computer could
be set and programmed...

01:29:30.032 --> 01:29:33.093
to accept factors
from youth, health...

01:29:33.169 --> 01:29:36.332
sexual fertility, intelligence...

01:29:36.406 --> 01:29:38.897
and a cross-section
of necessary skills.

01:29:38.975 --> 01:29:41.240
Of course, it would be
absolutely vital...

01:29:41.311 --> 01:29:45.270
that our top government
and military men be included...

01:29:45.349 --> 01:29:50.185
to foster and impart the required
principles of leadership and tradition.

01:29:56.228 --> 01:29:59.163
Naturally, they would breed
prodigiously.

01:29:59.231 --> 01:30:02.030
There would be much time
and little to do.

01:30:03.637 --> 01:30:08.575
But with the proper breeding techniques
and a ratio of, say...

01:30:08.643 --> 01:30:11.407
ten females to each male...

01:30:11.479 --> 01:30:16.110
they could then work their way back
to the present gross national product...

01:30:16.185 --> 01:30:17.948
within 20 years.

01:30:19.154 --> 01:30:21.884
But look, Doctor.
Wouldn't this nucleus of survivors...

01:30:21.957 --> 01:30:27.055
be so grief-stricken
and anguished that they...

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:30.623
well, envy the dead
and not want to go on living?

01:30:30.701 --> 01:30:33.534
No, sir. Excuse me.

01:30:42.814 --> 01:30:46.751
When they go down into the mine,
everyone would still be alive.

01:30:46.819 --> 01:30:48.912
There would be
no shocking memories...

01:30:48.988 --> 01:30:53.653
and the prevailing emotion will be one
of nostalgia for those left behind...

01:30:53.727 --> 01:30:56.594
combined with a spirt of...

01:30:56.663 --> 01:30:59.098
bold curiosity for
the adventure ahead!

01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.554
Doctor...

01:31:20.758 --> 01:31:26.196
you mentioned the ratio
of ten women to each man.

01:31:26.264 --> 01:31:29.393
Now, wouldn't that
necessitate the abandonment...

01:31:29.468 --> 01:31:33.268
of the so-called
monogamous sexual relationship?

01:31:33.338 --> 01:31:36.968
I mean, as far as men were concerned?

01:31:37.043 --> 01:31:38.408
Regrettably, yes.

01:31:38.478 --> 01:31:43.849
But it is a sacrifice required
for the future of the human race.

01:31:43.918 --> 01:31:48.913
I hasten to add that since each man
will be required to do prodigious...

01:31:50.692 --> 01:31:52.626
service along these lines...

01:31:52.694 --> 01:31:56.495
the women will have to be selected
for their sexual characteristics...

01:31:56.566 --> 01:32:00.332
which will have to be of
a highly stimulating nature.

01:32:00.403 --> 01:32:04.238
I must confess, you have an
astonishingly good idea there, Doctor.

01:32:05.409 --> 01:32:06.842
Thank you, sir.

01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:09.880
We ought to look at this
from the military point of view.

01:32:09.948 --> 01:32:13.884
I mean,
supposing the Ruskies...

01:32:13.952 --> 01:32:16.887
stashed away some big bombs,
see, and we didn't?

01:32:16.955 --> 01:32:19.857
When they come out in 100 years,
they could take over!

01:32:19.925 --> 01:32:21.688
I agree, Mr. President.

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:25.356
They might try a sneak attack so they
could take over our mine shaft space.

01:32:25.432 --> 01:32:30.062
It'd be extremely naive of us to
imagine that these new developments...

01:32:30.136 --> 01:32:33.072
are gonna cause any change
in Soviet expansionist policy!

01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:35.973
I mean, we must be
increasingly on the alert...

01:32:36.043 --> 01:32:38.569
to prevent them from taking over
other mine shaft space...

01:32:38.647 --> 01:32:40.581
in order to breed more
prodigiously than we do...

01:32:40.649 --> 01:32:43.777
thus knocking us out through
superior numbers when we emerge!

01:32:43.852 --> 01:32:47.949
Mr. President, we must not allow
a mine-shaft gap!

01:32:48.024 --> 01:32:50.117
Sir!

01:32:50.193 --> 01:32:52.457
I have a plan...

01:32:53.998 --> 01:32:56.330
<i>Mein Fuhrer...</i>

01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.994
I can walk!
