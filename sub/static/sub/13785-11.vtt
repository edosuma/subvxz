01:38.724 --> 01:40.933
(insects chirping)

01:49.234 --> 01:51.444
(sighs)

02:02.873 --> 02:04.582
(sighs)

02:11.507 --> 02:13.591
Quiet.

02:15.219 --> 02:17.470
I notice too, Stupid,
we're each of us

02:17.638 --> 02:20.389
breathing in and out.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.780
It's Bullock, Star, Utter,

02:35.948 --> 02:38.449
and Trixie. And Harry Manning's
outside on a sorrel.

02:38.617 --> 02:41.202
- What's the whore doing with 'em?
- I don't know.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.287
They ain't fucking her.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.583
Al:
What the fuck is afoot

02:47.751 --> 02:50.127
in that hardware store?

02:50.295 --> 02:53.172
Facing the dawn united,
we're even odds for disaster,

02:53.340 --> 02:55.550
let alone in fuckin' factions.

02:56.635 --> 03:00.221
Knowing him for an arrant maniac,

03:00.389 --> 03:03.641
I'll still not believe Bullock doubts me.

03:03.809 --> 03:07.436
(chuckles)
"Certain dangers meet to be faced

03:07.604 --> 03:11.357
only by the decent and decorous"--
or idiocy of that fuckin' ilk

03:11.525 --> 03:14.902
is what must have captured his thinking,
this fuckin' jerk.

03:15.070 --> 03:19.031
I'm going over there.
I am going the fuck over.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.118
Let them fucking try
to exclude me, huh?

03:24.204 --> 03:27.498
You know, saying I like you hefty

03:27.666 --> 03:31.168
don't mean you couldn't stand
losing a couple of fuckin' pounds.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.922
(groaning)

03:37.718 --> 03:39.719
- (Al's door closes)
- Oh! Ah.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.221
Whatever you'd have me
scrutinize must wait

03:42.389 --> 03:45.057
until certain cocksuckers
have received a piece of my mind.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.393
- Of whom do you speak?
- Why are you walking backwards?

03:47.561 --> 03:50.897
The ink's not yet dry and I'd have your
attention to the article, top right corner.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.482
- Stop fuckin' moving then.
- Oh, thank you.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.736
- How's the fuckin' ribs?
- Very painful.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.699
- Yeah, right there.
- Yeah.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.218
No rooms to let.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.179
Only taking the air.

04:23.347 --> 04:25.890
Well, go away.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.808
I'm at prayer.

04:30.604 --> 04:34.023
If that's not a lie
as I situate on the common,

04:34.191 --> 04:36.233
what claim has your piety
on my deference?

04:40.572 --> 04:42.698
Fuck yourself!

04:42.866 --> 04:46.243
Fuck you, sir!

04:46.411 --> 04:49.246
Who'd prevent expedition

04:49.414 --> 04:51.624
of one's life's disarray.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.463
Telegram for Mr. Swearengen.

04:57.631 --> 05:01.926
A superfluous trumpeting,
Mr. Blazanov, as we three are alone.

05:02.094 --> 05:05.763
Do I accomplish my purpose, Al,
as to the shooting at Mrs. Ellsworth?

05:05.931 --> 05:10.935
Short of accusation, do I waft the odor
of complicity in Hearst's direction...

05:11.103 --> 05:13.980
- Give me the telegram.
- ...to settle not only upon his clothing,

05:14.147 --> 05:16.190
but as it were, on the man himself,

05:16.358 --> 05:19.110
in the very fabric of his being?

05:19.277 --> 05:22.446
- This is bullshit!
- I'm sorry.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.782
"23 men hired,

05:24.950 --> 05:28.744
all on our way."
This squaw-fuckin' idiot.

05:28.912 --> 05:32.665
Proves in eight words
he's incompetent and a fuckin' liar.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.626
He can't have got Adams' telegram
more than four hours ago,

05:35.794 --> 05:38.170
yet he expects me
to believe that in four hours

05:38.338 --> 05:42.425
he can prudently assess
the qualities of 23 hires.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.802
And you know what
"on our way" means, huh?

05:44.970 --> 05:46.303
No.

05:46.471 --> 05:50.182
"On our way" means they're
getting drunk and blown

05:50.350 --> 05:53.102
in some saloon in Cheyenne
and running their mouths about

05:53.270 --> 05:57.023
this big fuckin' filibustering expedition
they've been commissioned for

05:57.190 --> 06:00.609
under the command of the famous Hawkeye--
the laziest, most shit-faced

06:00.777 --> 06:04.071
whore-mongering cocksucker
to ever piss my money away!

06:04.239 --> 06:06.073
Please do not strike me.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.828
Have you finished the article, Al?

06:13.582 --> 06:16.834
That I have not wiped his expectoration

06:17.002 --> 06:19.879
from my cheek is understandable.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.883
I'm threatened with death if I do.

06:26.803 --> 06:30.431
That I stand immobile these hours later

06:30.599 --> 06:34.268
speaks of a flaw in my will.

06:35.896 --> 06:39.732
Surely this is not
the culminating indignity.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.026
There remains, for example,

06:42.194 --> 06:44.904
receiving his regurgitations

06:45.072 --> 06:47.948
or swallowing his feces!

06:49.493 --> 06:51.827
Would I stand stoic

06:51.995 --> 06:53.871
still?

06:57.793 --> 07:00.586
I am going to fuck you up.

07:02.214 --> 07:05.132
I'm gonna fuck you up.

07:06.259 --> 07:10.346
And I'm the kind of cunt you'll let close.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.479
Quit it, Richardson.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.482
- Is it all right then, the article?
- Perfect.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.818
Fuckin' wafts just the way you want it to.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.736
I'll go ahead and publish then.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.781
I gotta get to the fuckin'
hardware store!

07:34.454 --> 07:35.996
(coughs)

07:45.674 --> 07:47.883
- Jack.
- Young man.

07:48.051 --> 07:52.054
At the soul's dark hour?

07:52.222 --> 07:54.265
Name one that fuckin' ain't.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.684
- Mr. Langrishe.
- Yes.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.232
We're going in there, EB.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.067
Shall I join you...

08:05.235 --> 08:07.236
as we all seem up and about?

08:07.404 --> 08:09.989
(farts)
Excuse me!

08:11.408 --> 08:12.992
Gentlemen.
(clears throat)

08:13.160 --> 08:17.329
Waiting for the sheriff.
We campaign in Sturgis.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.666
(yawns)

08:26.047 --> 08:27.840
Hmm.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.928
A meeting, I gather, of the upper
fucking crust exclusively.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.514
- No hoi polloi need apply.
- I ought to have called you.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.392
What events in the camp would argue
I be called back from Sturgis,

08:38.559 --> 08:42.104
- what we are trying to decide.
- It's not a meeting at all, per se.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.648
Now I don't feel so horribly injured.

08:44.816 --> 08:49.028
The meeting per se
is what he'll not be kept from.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.989
Jack Langrishe. He's all right.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.952
You showed perfect judgment, sir.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.289
I'd keep from the camp
that your janissaries have arrived.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.541
We'll quarter at your find.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.127
- Will you drink?
- No, thank you.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.463
I will.

09:14.512 --> 09:17.681
Sol: Shall we leave it:
being generally vigilant,

09:17.849 --> 09:21.685
under very specific circumstances
we'll wire you to make early return?

09:21.853 --> 09:25.022
Yes. That's exactly it.

09:25.190 --> 09:28.400
And those would be?

09:37.244 --> 09:41.330
- Any further shooting out of the ordinary.
- Like at Mrs. Ellsworth, definitely.

09:41.498 --> 09:45.125
- Hearst-initiated horseshit of any sort.
- Intimidation or the like.

09:45.293 --> 09:49.255
If it looks to eventuate
in immediate violence.

09:53.176 --> 09:57.096
Otherwise why try even to make it
to Sturgis for the speeches?

09:57.264 --> 10:00.849
Hearst-initiated bullshit
is inevitable is his point.

10:01.017 --> 10:05.521
Surely, sir, you leave
in the certain knowledge

10:05.689 --> 10:09.233
that you are the camp's
irreplaceable man.

10:10.568 --> 10:14.363
He don't need no further encouragement
in that way of thinking.

10:14.531 --> 10:18.409
Comes to sending a wire,
I put that Russian ill at ease.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.995
Sol:
Oh, I do all right with him.

10:22.789 --> 10:26.000
My meetings--
I provide refreshments.

10:44.102 --> 10:47.229
You were shown the tent
of the man I want killed first?

10:47.397 --> 10:50.024
- Looked fine, how he wants to work it.
- Hearst: Ah.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.748
(sighs)

11:05.915 --> 11:07.916
(knocks on door)

11:12.297 --> 11:14.673
- I'm leaving.
- Come in.

11:14.841 --> 11:18.218
- It's too much. He's too cruel.
- Come in.

11:19.471 --> 11:23.140
Brazenly sends the other packing,

11:23.308 --> 11:26.643
to brazenly install her replacement
in the theater.

11:26.811 --> 11:30.105
How was he brazen
with the one who left?

11:30.273 --> 11:33.192
No one with eyes could
fail to recognize their connection.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.862
- And now brazenly--
- Us recognizing his connection

11:37.030 --> 11:40.240
to the one who left does not
mean he was brazen.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.659
Fine.

11:43.828 --> 11:47.664
Fine then.
I just came to say goodbye.

11:47.832 --> 11:51.377
Must I agree he is brazen

11:51.544 --> 11:53.629
for you to not leave the troupe?

11:57.342 --> 12:00.386
(sobs)
He has no respect for art.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.262
Claudia.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.431
(sobbing)

12:04.599 --> 12:08.477
- He hates me.
- No.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.775
I was well-received in Denver.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.486
Ja, very well received.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.781
I could have stayed.

12:20.949 --> 12:23.659
I could have let you all go on.

12:23.827 --> 12:27.996
I think you were approached
by Millerick.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.333
I was.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.672
Go to sleep, Claudia.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.507
No coaches now anyhow.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.392
Did he suspect

12:48.560 --> 12:50.519
Millerick approached me?

12:51.896 --> 12:53.730
He doesn't miss much.

12:53.898 --> 12:57.401
He misses everything.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.570
(sighs)

13:14.878 --> 13:17.212
I juggled at Amateur Night.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.967
And what are you doing now?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.511
Praying for my loved ones.

13:24.679 --> 13:27.764
How nice. Lucky them.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.607
Would my conversating with her

13:36.774 --> 13:38.817
or lingering after supper

13:38.985 --> 13:41.445
have disrupted
the little one's routine

13:41.613 --> 13:44.865
on a day that had been
disrupted previous?

13:45.033 --> 13:46.992
Yes.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.412
Already she'd seen
a series of people taking up watch

13:50.580 --> 13:52.956
to protect that schoolhouse.

13:53.124 --> 13:56.126
And how many questions
must have occurred to her--

13:56.294 --> 13:59.213
because that is a bright child.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.799
"What is transpiring that
we need guarding from?"

14:04.010 --> 14:06.887
And what memories
must that have brought back

14:07.055 --> 14:09.556
of her own dear family murdered

14:09.724 --> 14:13.101
in a sudden fake Indian depredation

14:13.269 --> 14:16.271
by shit-heel fuckin' road agents.

14:19.275 --> 14:22.819
Not solely how would I like

14:22.987 --> 14:26.240
to be passing the evening, the like.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.325
When I've left,

14:28.493 --> 14:32.120
have I given the mother
more calming down to do

14:32.288 --> 14:34.790
before she gets the child asleep?

14:36.668 --> 14:38.585
Them's the sort of things

14:38.753 --> 14:41.547
is what you have to consider.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.716
(dog whimpers)

15:10.702 --> 15:13.370
Fuck, must you hover,
fucking Merrick?

15:13.538 --> 15:16.915
I admit to wondering, Al, if you have
any further impression of my article.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.419
- Didn't I tell you how well it wafted?
- If on second reading--

15:20.587 --> 15:24.214
Merrick, it's a good article.
It'll no doubt irritate him, fucking Hearst.

15:24.382 --> 15:27.593
But I'm wakeful wondering
who he's likely to shoot at next,

15:27.760 --> 15:31.263
so with regard to that I've gave
your article all the thought I need to.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.849
Who do you think he might shoot at?

15:35.768 --> 15:38.687
I have no fucking idea, Merrick.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.440
I doubt it'll be long before we find out.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.151
And in the fucking interval until we do,

15:44.319 --> 15:47.029
I guess I'll just have
to abandon any prospect

15:47.196 --> 15:51.491
of finding respite in any part of your rag
I could just fucking read

15:51.659 --> 15:54.494
without having to evaluate
how it fucking wafts!

15:54.662 --> 15:56.913
Oh, which leaves me

15:57.081 --> 16:00.125
the solace of contemplating
the journeying hither

16:00.293 --> 16:03.712
of the intrepid fucking Hawkeye
and his 23 fucking reprobates

16:03.880 --> 16:07.883
to even the odds in the coming combat.
Didn't tell you that, did I, Adams?

16:08.051 --> 16:11.011
Hawkeye's wired
to announce he's on his way.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.055
Does that sound likely to you

16:13.222 --> 16:16.266
or does it confirm our deepest doubts

16:16.434 --> 16:18.769
about his incompetence and veracity?

16:18.936 --> 16:22.814
And mine, in turn, about you
that I allowed to fucking vouch for him!?

16:25.610 --> 16:28.445
Couldn't let him
read his fucking paper?

16:38.414 --> 16:41.625
(Harry mumbling)

16:42.710 --> 16:44.419
26...

16:44.587 --> 16:46.338
27...

16:46.506 --> 16:48.340
28.

16:48.508 --> 16:52.177
Uh, not counting them soldiers
or Yankton's commissioner.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.683
I won't be lingering once we've finished.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.144
If you want to stay and politic,
you'll have to ride back alone.

17:01.312 --> 17:04.314
I hate what happened in your home.

17:04.482 --> 17:06.858
It's all right.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.695
Your wife good enough
to ask me in for breakfast.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.365
- I'm working on my presentation.
- That lovely woman

17:13.532 --> 17:15.826
putting her hand
behind her for support

17:15.992 --> 17:18.869
- when I feared she might fall to the floor.
- Won't you shut up about it?

17:19.038 --> 17:22.332
And then, even if only briefly,
to have failed to acknowledge

17:22.500 --> 17:24.960
it had been my wind, I'd--

17:40.226 --> 17:43.687
What's your purpose here?

17:43.855 --> 17:46.606
- What do you mean?
- There's no Sioux around here.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.693
Shall I go find some,
ask 'em to join us?

17:49.861 --> 17:52.320
I'm saying there's no fort
and there's no Sioux.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.573
Why would they
have you bivouacked?

17:54.741 --> 17:57.409
Seems like you got me
confused for a general.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.494
(clears throat)

18:01.789 --> 18:03.331
Don't be grazing by the windows.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.792
Come in and listen
or stay the fuck out of sight.

18:05.960 --> 18:09.421
I guess you got yourself
mistaken for a general.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.758
Soldier: He wants to know
what we're here for.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.636
We're here for the election.
Maybe gonna exercise a franchise.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.680
(clears throat)

18:21.392 --> 18:23.226
Time for us to speak now, Sheriff.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.771
Have they told you yet
who you're voting for?

18:25.938 --> 18:27.355
Not yet.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.399
Sheriff, we--

18:29.567 --> 18:31.902
Shut up, Harry.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.753
(gasping)

18:54.717 --> 18:56.843
Mr. Utter!

18:57.011 --> 18:59.429
Mr.--

19:02.308 --> 19:04.935
(crying)

19:21.118 --> 19:23.245
(lock jiggling)

19:26.290 --> 19:29.167
The key got stuck.

19:37.260 --> 19:40.762
Ready for fucking Freddie?
Hearst let his dogs loose.

19:40.930 --> 19:43.932
Davey, get to the Russian.
Tell him to wire Sturgis.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.977
Say to wire Bullock as agreed, huh?

19:47.144 --> 19:51.439
- (sobbing) I want my child.
- I'll-- I'll go get her now.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.234
Mrs. Ellsworth, I'll go--
Mr. Ellsworth's been shot.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.945
- Mr. Ellsworth's been killed.
- I want my child!

19:57.113 --> 20:00.282
She'll be here with you before
you know it, Mrs. Ellsworth.

20:00.449 --> 20:04.703
- Oh, what did I do to him?
- We'll go upstairs, get you a drink.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.913
What did I do to that poor man?

20:07.081 --> 20:08.874
You didn't fucking shoot him.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.168
And don't be going off
into fucking hysterics, huh?

20:16.549 --> 20:19.718
Collect your child. Utter will be
back with her here any minute.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.469
Come on.

20:25.349 --> 20:28.059
I'm going to make her breakfast.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.882
Pinchbeck motherfucker.

21:11.062 --> 21:14.022
My goodness!
Bare-breasted. My word.

21:14.190 --> 21:17.484
Who has commissioned
such behavior?

21:17.652 --> 21:21.571
Who summons you
with such power to do his will?

21:25.910 --> 21:28.870
Trixie:
Mr. Hearst? Mr. Hearst?

21:35.544 --> 21:37.212
(gunshot)

21:43.052 --> 21:46.304
Did someone interrupted
your rendezvous?

21:46.472 --> 21:49.641
Did someone else attack him?

21:49.809 --> 21:51.810
Cover those things.

22:02.947 --> 22:06.282
(grunts)

22:11.539 --> 22:13.373
Give me your fucking poot-butt gun.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.917
- Why?
- Fucking shoot me with it if you don't.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.795
- What's going on, Trixie?
- Ellsworth's murdered,

22:18.963 --> 22:21.965
and I fucking shot Hearst
and I don't think I killed him!

22:22.133 --> 22:25.135
Shoot me or he'll do for all of us.

22:26.804 --> 22:29.431
- Shoot me! Shoot me!
- Shh.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.808
- Don't you fucking take me anywhere!
- Shut up!

22:34.478 --> 22:37.063
Cy:
Stand the fuck up!

22:38.441 --> 22:41.818
I piss hard-stole money away

22:41.986 --> 22:45.613
to gussy you fucking cunts up.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.532
Starchy bullshit.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.326
We fucking pretend
there's a difference

22:50.494 --> 22:53.830
between fat-ass snatch
and fat-ass snatch in a fucking petticoat!

22:53.998 --> 22:55.331
Come on, Mr. T--

22:55.499 --> 22:57.876
Where are we going,
you rummy-faced piece of shit?!

22:58.044 --> 22:59.711
I'm just saying--

22:59.879 --> 23:02.672
Just saying what?
What were you just saying?

23:02.840 --> 23:04.215
I don't know, sir.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.927
Weren't you being
this fat twat's gallant?

23:10.181 --> 23:12.807
Ain't Con the nuts, fatso?

23:15.811 --> 23:19.355
Ain't it great to have a fucking beau?

23:24.987 --> 23:27.030
I'm Seth Bullock.

23:27.198 --> 23:30.742
In Montana I had a hardware business
with my partner Sol Star,

23:30.910 --> 23:32.744
and we do the same in Deadwood,

23:32.912 --> 23:36.581
which we came to in '76.

23:36.749 --> 23:40.418
I was Marshal
and Territorial Delegate in Montana,

23:40.586 --> 23:44.923
and I'm Health Commissioner
and Sheriff where we are now.

23:45.091 --> 23:48.259
With the Hills now part
of the new territory,

23:48.427 --> 23:51.346
I run for Sheriff
of the new organized county.

23:51.514 --> 23:54.891
If elected, my intention's
to look to the good

23:55.059 --> 23:57.811
and safety of people hereabouts.

23:57.978 --> 24:02.816
I will venture my life that
law-abiding persons will be secure

24:02.983 --> 24:05.860
in their rights and their property.

24:26.257 --> 24:27.632
I have to go.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.093
(audience murmuring)

24:47.153 --> 24:49.320
What is it, Bullock?
What happened?

24:49.488 --> 24:52.115
Don't you know? Have they just
got you handling the votes?

24:55.327 --> 24:57.245
The voting exclusively.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.331
He's dead. Dead!

25:00.499 --> 25:01.958
And at my hands!

25:02.126 --> 25:05.128
- Or the next thing to it.
- Who?

25:05.296 --> 25:06.921
- Hearst!
- He's dead?

25:07.089 --> 25:08.673
- I think.
- Boss!

25:08.841 --> 25:11.509
Excuse me.

25:11.677 --> 25:14.179
The gimp's making
breakfast for you,

25:14.346 --> 25:17.098
if you ain't et yet-- Jewel.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.642
- Where was he hit?
- I don't know. Trixie shot him.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.936
- Dan: Boss!
- Trixie said she killed him?

25:22.104 --> 25:24.022
EB said Trixie killed Hearst!

25:25.608 --> 25:28.359
- You saw him dead?
- No.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.486
(sighs)
How bad was he hurt?

25:30.654 --> 25:33.948
- I'm not sure.
- How bad did Trixie say he was hurt?

25:34.116 --> 25:36.784
If he wasn't hurt, wouldn't I have
seen him pursue her?

25:36.952 --> 25:39.954
What you mean is she might not
have fucking shot him at all!

25:40.122 --> 25:43.791
Four steps removed.
No fucking closer.

25:48.464 --> 25:51.007
Boss.

25:51.175 --> 25:54.385
- Or w-wouldn't he have?
- Johnny: Wouldn't he have what?

25:54.553 --> 25:56.262
Al: Shut up, EB.

26:06.982 --> 26:10.860
- I'm a dead man.
- You ain't gonna be alone.

26:19.870 --> 26:22.497
- Trixie: I've made this fucking walk before.
- All right.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.921
- Stay here till I get him.
- Then you get out!

26:30.089 --> 26:32.507
Get out with your hovering
and fucking clucking!

26:32.675 --> 26:34.717
(door closes)

26:36.512 --> 26:39.555
Before hell breaks fucking loose.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.648
Trixie's here, in back.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.652
Your idea, her coming here?

26:52.820 --> 26:55.905
My fucking idea,
after she did what she did.

26:56.073 --> 26:58.658
Was it your idea to have her do that?

26:59.910 --> 27:02.453
All right.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.880
Loopy fucking cunt.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.102
Mother's upstairs.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.439
Get out of the fucking way, Jewel.

27:29.606 --> 27:33.318
- Here, let me take it up.
- No, you fucking won't.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.908
Oh, for Christ's sake.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.172
Mr. Utter's come with the child.

28:12.649 --> 28:14.734
(Sofia crying)

28:16.070 --> 28:17.820
Getting another plate.

28:29.541 --> 28:33.169
(whispering) Mr. Utter said only that
Sofia's mother had requested her at The Gem.

28:33.337 --> 28:35.630
Rely that something
fucked has transpired...

28:37.549 --> 28:39.717
with Mose God knows where,

28:39.885 --> 28:41.803
and me likely needed in camp.

28:41.970 --> 28:45.640
- Uh, go ahead, Jane.
- I'll stay with Mrs. Bullock.

28:47.684 --> 28:50.686
Trouble jumps off, ring the bell.
That'll bring me fucking running.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.438
All right.

29:00.906 --> 29:04.242
Or I guess maybe I'll just stay instead.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.911
Doc:
I suppose there's some connection

29:07.079 --> 29:10.206
between his condition and yours.

29:10.374 --> 29:14.210
That bare-breasted woman who shot me
seemed to think there ought to be.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.629
(groans) Shit!

29:16.797 --> 29:18.256
Go ahead,

29:18.424 --> 29:21.175
knowing I'd appreciate
less enthusiasm.

29:21.343 --> 29:23.136
(groans)

29:23.303 --> 29:27.348
Through the years, that fellow's path
and mine crossed several times.

29:27.516 --> 29:31.269
I never meant him
a moment's harm,

29:31.437 --> 29:34.063
but the natural operation
of my holdings

29:34.231 --> 29:37.859
and his bad luck brought me
to figure in his imagination

29:38.026 --> 29:40.194
as some sort of bogey.

29:40.362 --> 29:41.904
(groans)

29:43.449 --> 29:45.700
I expect my attacker

29:45.868 --> 29:48.828
was a bawd connected
somehow to the man in back

29:48.996 --> 29:51.873
before he married so luckily.

29:52.040 --> 29:56.461
Likely, she fell victim, as he did,
to imagining me responsible

29:56.628 --> 29:58.671
for the change in her situation.

29:58.839 --> 30:00.756
(straining)
God damn it!

30:00.924 --> 30:04.760
Often, because our
interests are extensive,

30:04.928 --> 30:08.222
people like me are believed
the authors of events

30:08.390 --> 30:10.016
which may benefit

30:10.184 --> 30:12.768
our holdings,

30:12.936 --> 30:16.814
when our connection
in fact is incidental.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.108
God damn it!

30:19.276 --> 30:21.444
(grunts)

30:21.612 --> 30:25.531
(laughs)
Whew, ahh.

30:30.746 --> 30:33.414
I have some calls to make.

30:33.582 --> 30:36.083
Will your gunmen let me pass?

30:36.251 --> 30:39.128
Of course.

30:39.296 --> 30:42.298
Don't you want dress the wound?

30:55.938 --> 30:58.147
My name is Josiane.

30:58.315 --> 31:00.149
Mr. Langrishe was so generous

31:00.317 --> 31:04.028
to say he would install me
today in the theater.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.988
Sit down, dear.

31:07.199 --> 31:11.035
Oh! We are waiting for him.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.579
One of our chief occupations.

31:25.384 --> 31:28.469
Langrishe:
Mr. Farnum!

31:28.637 --> 31:31.180
Ah, good day, sir.

31:32.975 --> 31:36.185
Mr. Farnum, a little while ago

31:36.353 --> 31:38.437
I heard what I took

31:38.605 --> 31:41.399
for a gunshot--

31:41.567 --> 31:45.027
an impression I remark
not on the grounds of its uniqueness,

31:45.195 --> 31:48.573
but for the shot having
seemed to issue from so near

31:48.740 --> 31:50.283
to my recumbent ear...

31:50.450 --> 31:52.368
You are not mistaken, sir.

31:52.536 --> 31:54.954
...the hallway, that is to say,

31:55.122 --> 31:59.125
separated from where I rested
only by a wall

31:59.293 --> 32:02.587
whose thinness you've no doubt heard

32:02.754 --> 32:05.631
others before me deplore.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.719
The walls do thicken in our west wing.

32:11.305 --> 32:14.265
I'll have a quick look for vacancies.

32:15.517 --> 32:17.101
Hearst shot;

32:17.269 --> 32:19.520
the wound, alas, not mortal.

32:24.067 --> 32:27.903
"No help," as we say at the tables.

32:29.573 --> 32:32.825
Booth never went you better.

32:32.993 --> 32:36.746
Anon anon, sir. Anon anon.

32:44.254 --> 32:46.505
God damn it, Richardson.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.550
You're too ugly to be sneaking up
on fucking people.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.510
From Mrs. Marchbanks.

32:51.678 --> 32:54.805
We got all the fucking food we need.

32:58.435 --> 33:01.312
Who the fuck is
Mrs. Marchbanks anyway?

33:01.480 --> 33:03.272
It's Aunt Lou.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.983
I guess I'd know her for Mrs. Marchbanks

33:06.151 --> 33:09.654
if she took time to introduce herself.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.031
Tell the arrogant nigger thanks.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.450
No hurry returning the basket.

33:14.618 --> 33:17.787
Tell her my fucking name's
Miss Caulfield...

33:20.457 --> 33:22.541
I think.

33:25.545 --> 33:27.171
The terms come clear.

33:27.339 --> 33:31.342
If she'd keep her property here,

33:31.510 --> 33:33.344
she'll leave,

33:33.512 --> 33:36.138
having first hired
as many as Hearst has

33:36.306 --> 33:39.183
and who can kill as well as his do,
and ain't disadvantaged too

33:39.351 --> 33:43.479
to keep Hearst from killing her,
which by the shots yesterday

33:43.647 --> 33:46.607
and Ellsworth butchered today

33:46.775 --> 33:51.612
means her to understand Hearst
will not cease endeavoring to do.

33:56.159 --> 33:59.662
But if she'd herself stay in camp,

33:59.830 --> 34:03.666
she must sell her property to him.

34:07.921 --> 34:10.840
A very pithy rendering.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.804
(whispers)
I want to feel his beard.

34:19.349 --> 34:21.183
Mr. Ellsworth's

34:21.351 --> 34:24.603
with God now, Sofia.

34:24.771 --> 34:29.108
I want to feel his beard so I can pray
that he's saying goodbye to me.

34:36.158 --> 34:39.159
Duck duck duck

34:39.327 --> 34:43.038
duck duck.

34:43.206 --> 34:46.041
- Goose.
- Class: Go, James, go!

34:46.208 --> 34:48.043
Go, James, go!
Go, James, go!

34:48.210 --> 34:50.920
Go, James!

34:51.089 --> 34:52.380
Class: Yay!

34:52.549 --> 34:56.051
Aw. Outflanked by a boy
half my size.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.888
Next time I'll get you, James.

35:13.195 --> 35:15.696
Ellsworth's murdered,
head-shot at the Garret find.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.449
Your partner's sweetheart
put one in Hearst's shoulder.

35:18.617 --> 35:21.285
- Where's Mrs. Ellsworth?
- Above with the child.

35:21.453 --> 35:24.163
- With the child.
- I fucking heard ya.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.170
He once had something to do with her.

35:33.089 --> 35:37.927
Reason for his making the case she sell,
keep her here for another swing.

35:38.094 --> 35:41.055
Reason ain't his long suit.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.781
(gasps)

36:09.209 --> 36:11.460
(sobbing)

36:17.342 --> 36:19.260
(Doc coughing)

36:25.350 --> 36:28.435
Bullet removed uneventfully.

36:28.603 --> 36:32.356
Let's pray he avoids infection.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.650
What did Hearst say of the shooting?

36:34.818 --> 36:38.195
That some bawd
still connected to Ellsworth

36:38.363 --> 36:41.156
must have blamed him for the murder.

36:41.324 --> 36:44.493
Wrongheaded and fallen
in the bargain.

36:46.329 --> 36:49.039
Would you find pretext to let
the mother know I'm here?

36:49.207 --> 36:52.209
- Bullock's with her.
- Shall I shout out and ask it of him?

37:03.054 --> 37:05.514
Very much in your line, this type thing?

37:05.682 --> 37:07.641
Yes.

37:07.809 --> 37:09.310
Not to my taste at all.

37:09.477 --> 37:13.314
Times past, one's fled.

37:13.481 --> 37:15.524
(knock on door)

37:17.861 --> 37:21.447
Doc's here. Someone fell.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.623
Will you excuse me
for a moment, darling?

37:41.801 --> 37:44.053
I want to see Mr. Ellsworth.

37:47.724 --> 37:50.017
Excuse me.

37:53.063 --> 37:56.190
(grunting)

37:57.400 --> 37:59.401
(humming)

38:14.918 --> 38:18.170
Are you certain

38:18.338 --> 38:21.757
that she saw her family dead?

38:21.925 --> 38:23.926
Yes.

38:27.263 --> 38:31.058
I certainly assume she did.

38:31.226 --> 38:33.352
The man I once was, Al,

38:33.520 --> 38:35.938
was not formidable,

38:36.106 --> 38:38.691
and I am but his shadow now,

38:38.858 --> 38:41.819
and yet I'd be put to use.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.988
A decoy, perhaps.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.447
A weight to drop

38:45.615 --> 38:48.492
on villains from above.

38:49.953 --> 38:52.955
As I heard the account,

38:53.123 --> 38:55.541
the child was found inside

38:55.709 --> 38:59.003
a hollowed-out tree trunk

38:59.170 --> 39:01.547
some distance from the others.

39:02.882 --> 39:06.385
Having crawled from the carnage

39:06.553 --> 39:08.887
and hidden herself,

39:09.055 --> 39:11.932
I'd always assumed.

39:12.100 --> 39:15.644
See, I suppose,

39:15.812 --> 39:18.439
rather than Sofia crawling

39:18.606 --> 39:20.899
unseen from the carnage,

39:21.067 --> 39:23.360
the possibility might exist

39:23.528 --> 39:25.988
that the family hid her in the tree trunk

39:26.156 --> 39:28.574
and then fled that distance

39:28.742 --> 39:31.577
before the murderers fell upon them.

39:32.954 --> 39:35.914
For the child to have been found

39:36.082 --> 39:38.709
having been savaged by wolves,

39:38.877 --> 39:41.462
those hours later

39:41.629 --> 39:43.464
by strangers,

39:43.631 --> 39:45.841
and then taken away

39:46.009 --> 39:49.178
having never seen

39:49.345 --> 39:52.347
her family again,

39:52.515 --> 39:55.559
living or dead...

39:59.939 --> 40:02.024
(sniffs)

40:18.249 --> 40:20.167
I can fix that.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.088
Slainte.

40:39.187 --> 40:41.021
Thought you was
near pitching a tent

40:41.189 --> 40:43.565
and setting up housekeeping
over on that first step.

40:43.733 --> 40:45.234
(snickers)

40:46.903 --> 40:49.446
You sound like a pig
my cousin run off with.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.868
Get another?

41:08.842 --> 41:11.593
If that cocksucker
hadn't shareholders,

41:11.761 --> 41:14.763
you could murder him
while you adjusted his back.

41:14.931 --> 41:17.891
Serpent's teeth-- shareholders.

41:18.059 --> 41:21.562
10,000 would rise to replace him.

41:44.460 --> 41:47.254
All right, darling.
All right.

42:09.485 --> 42:13.572
- Monitor my thinking, Jack.
- Oh, no warrant as to competence.

42:13.740 --> 42:16.450
Had Hearst wanted this woman killed,
she'd be dead already.

42:16.618 --> 42:20.120
Agree. The husband's murdered
to coerce her to sell.

42:20.288 --> 42:22.289
Al: For the moment,
the child's safe too, huh?

42:22.457 --> 42:26.168
- Pending the mother's decision-- agree.
- Safe then to let 'em go, huh?

42:26.336 --> 42:28.337
I would, sir.
Yes.

42:30.506 --> 42:33.842
Gonna take Mrs. Ellsworth home.

42:34.010 --> 42:36.136
As you think best.

42:37.597 --> 42:41.058
I wish to thank you again,
Mr. Swearengen.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.728
We are all very grateful.

43:00.912 --> 43:03.830
Trixie's with Star at his place.
No one knows but Shaunessey,

43:03.998 --> 43:06.166
who lives in fucking terror of me, huh?

43:06.334 --> 43:10.003
Passages between their places
only Shaunessey knows.

43:10.171 --> 43:13.131
Heartfelt condolences, madam.

43:15.343 --> 43:19.054
I get to see Mr. Ellsworth tomorrow.

43:19.222 --> 43:21.306
Very good, young lady.

43:21.474 --> 43:23.642
God bless.

43:23.810 --> 43:27.854
You take care of them, Bullock.
Leave the other to me, huh?

43:28.022 --> 43:30.983
Oh, Bullock, you might want
to stand guard outside her place.

43:31.150 --> 43:34.611
- I'll take Charlie as backup.
- No, Hearst ain't gonna be coming for her,

43:34.779 --> 43:38.573
but to bring the matter home as grave.
It'd make a case for her selling her claim

43:38.741 --> 43:42.244
not to jeopardize the tranquility
of your own hearth.

43:43.788 --> 43:45.872
Thank you for looking to them.

43:58.344 --> 44:01.930
Nimbleness, lad, dexterity.

44:02.098 --> 44:04.599
I'd prefer Hearst's advantage at arms.

44:04.767 --> 44:06.727
True true.

44:06.894 --> 44:08.854
The world is less than perfect.

44:25.913 --> 44:29.124
The camp is galvanized.

44:30.126 --> 44:32.794
People scurry about.

44:32.962 --> 44:35.964
They've tasks to perform.

44:36.132 --> 44:38.884
They feel important.

44:45.725 --> 44:48.435
I oughtn't to work in these places.

44:51.647 --> 44:54.941
I was not born to crush my own kind.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.759
Right with you, Wu.
In there. In there.

45:20.927 --> 45:22.344
First door.

45:22.512 --> 45:24.221
Yeah, in there.

45:35.775 --> 45:39.861
When he leaves, them that ain't
lining this fucking hallway

45:40.029 --> 45:44.699
like he's the tallest, best-looking
white man ever got fucking lucky

45:44.867 --> 45:47.369
better prepare
for a fucking beating.

45:51.040 --> 45:54.543
Wu, Custer City,

45:54.710 --> 45:57.421
brings back all his Chinks

45:57.588 --> 46:00.424
the fuck back to Deadwood.

46:03.302 --> 46:05.011
Wu...

46:05.179 --> 46:07.722
back Deadwood?

46:10.393 --> 46:13.520
Brings all his Chinks back, huh?

46:13.688 --> 46:16.898
Wu, Custer City,

46:17.066 --> 46:18.608
back Deadwood!

46:18.776 --> 46:22.571
(speaks Chinese) Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,

46:22.738 --> 46:25.240
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday!
10 day, Swedgin!

46:25.408 --> 46:28.952
I am sorry, Wu.
I'm sorry I made you wait.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.997
But I want you to bring them now.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.916
While you're about your journey,

46:35.084 --> 46:39.504
I'll be trying to conceive some
practical use for your countrymen's arrival

46:39.672 --> 46:43.341
besides seeming to swell our ranks.
Oh, we'll give 'em guns, yeah?

46:43.509 --> 46:47.804
We'll provide 'em with guns, so any of
the slant-eyed bastards know what one is,

46:47.972 --> 46:52.893
or, perish the thought, know how to use one--
we'll enhance our prospects.

46:53.060 --> 46:55.604
Guns.

46:55.771 --> 46:57.939
Chung Kuo.

46:58.107 --> 47:01.443
Wu, Custer City, back Deadwood,

47:01.611 --> 47:04.779
150 Chung Kuo cocksucker, Swedgin.

47:04.947 --> 47:07.365
Shut the fuck up, Wu.

47:10.495 --> 47:11.912
Heng dai.

47:15.750 --> 47:17.751
Heng dai.

47:17.919 --> 47:20.128
Heng dai, fucking Wu.

47:36.604 --> 47:38.939
Big man.

47:39.106 --> 47:41.316
Wu-- big man.

47:47.073 --> 47:49.449
Rouse him to spend on pussy,

47:49.617 --> 47:51.660
or rob the son of a bitch.

48:06.050 --> 48:08.760
