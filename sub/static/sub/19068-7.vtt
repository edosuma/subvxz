00:00.763 --> 00:02.463
<i>Previously, on Dracula...</i>

00:02.949 --> 00:05.459
- She is Ilona.
- You must never again mention

00:05.500 --> 00:07.416
Mina Murray's
resemblance to my wife.

00:07.451 --> 00:08.914
Nickel steel alloy.

00:08.949 --> 00:11.216
The answer to our
resonating casing problem.

00:11.251 --> 00:13.984
Sole shareholder, empire munitions.

00:14.019 --> 00:15.654
General Shaw is taking bribes.

00:15.689 --> 00:17.990
I didn't know you had
such a remarkable penchant

00:18.024 --> 00:20.058
for ruining the lives
of innocent men.

00:20.093 --> 00:23.627
What makes you so sure that you
are immune from the same fate?

00:24.797 --> 00:26.965
She's not a bookkeeper.
She's an actress.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.700
I did everything you asked.

00:29.802 --> 00:31.003
I refined the process.

00:31.037 --> 00:33.372
You will finally be able
to walk in sunlight.

00:33.406 --> 00:36.241
Might I recommend
keeping it short for once?

00:36.276 --> 00:39.411
We have no idea how long
the serum will last.

00:39.445 --> 00:41.446
If you are
involved with Grayson

00:41.480 --> 00:43.715
and he proves to be a vampire,

00:43.749 --> 00:46.083
you will face the full wrath
of the brotherhood.

00:46.118 --> 00:49.721
Women have many secret ways
of expressing desire.

00:49.755 --> 00:54.325
Mina likely feels
the same way about you.

00:55.327 --> 00:57.028
You need to leave.

00:57.062 --> 00:59.130
- You found it.
- The Dresden triptych.

01:07.837 --> 01:11.394
__

01:25.690 --> 01:29.492
There. Finished.

01:29.526 --> 01:32.895
Everyone to their stations.
Mr. Kowalski, fire it up.

01:32.930 --> 01:34.431
Full power.

01:34.465 --> 01:36.333
Get to your stations!

01:36.367 --> 01:39.669
When did you last feed?

01:39.703 --> 01:41.137
Nickel steel alloy.

01:41.172 --> 01:43.273
If this doesn't tame the beast,
nothing will.

01:43.307 --> 01:44.740
Answer me.
How long has it been?

01:44.775 --> 01:47.610
My habits are not
your concern, professor.

01:47.644 --> 01:50.179
- You're playing with fire.
- I'm well aware of my needs.

01:50.213 --> 01:51.914
I've been cursed with them
for over four centuries.

01:51.949 --> 01:54.116
- You need blood!
- I'm not hungry.

01:54.150 --> 01:57.252
Gentlemen, we're ready.

01:57.287 --> 02:00.522
Mr. Kowalski, by all means.

02:28.317 --> 02:30.284
That's it, gentlemen.

02:30.319 --> 02:31.920
Mr. Kowalski,

02:31.954 --> 02:34.063
take these men
to the nearest public house.

02:34.098 --> 02:35.302
Drinks on me.

02:35.337 --> 02:37.191
- Yes, sir!
- And take it easy, boys.

02:37.226 --> 02:41.462
I want this place shipshape
for our public demonstration,

02:41.497 --> 02:44.598
and the day after that,
well, I won't be worth a damn

02:44.633 --> 02:47.268
and the Order Draco
won't have a pot to piss in.

02:58.479 --> 03:02.683
Harker.

03:02.717 --> 03:06.053
General Shaw is innocent.

03:06.087 --> 03:09.523
He never took bribes
to promote war.

03:09.557 --> 03:13.460
- But your informant...
- My informant was a paid actress.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.662
Really?

03:15.696 --> 03:17.397
Who would do such a thing?

03:17.432 --> 03:20.600
- The hoax was elaborate.
- Hm.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.102
That takes planning and funds.

03:22.136 --> 03:23.770
Whoever did this,
they sit to benefit from it

03:23.804 --> 03:25.939
financially or at...

03:27.541 --> 03:28.641
It was you.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.677
Don't be absurd.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.912
Was I not the one
who told you explicitly

03:32.947 --> 03:34.547
to drop the whole business?

03:34.582 --> 03:38.084
Yes, after you knew that I couldn't.
That I wouldn't.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.718
What have you done?

03:39.752 --> 03:42.854
We, Harker, have done
what was necessary.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.890
An honorable man's
reputation destroyed.

03:44.924 --> 03:46.158
That was necessary?

03:46.193 --> 03:48.827
Just another fallen soldier
in the energy war.

03:48.861 --> 03:53.031
Not the first. Not the last.

03:53.066 --> 03:57.102
You've made me accomplice to this.

03:57.136 --> 03:59.504
I'll expose you.

03:59.538 --> 04:02.641
Expose what?

04:02.675 --> 04:06.411
You were the one who sought out
the bookkeeper.

04:06.445 --> 04:09.481
You were the one who sent
the forged documents

04:09.515 --> 04:11.516
to the newspapers.

04:11.550 --> 04:14.285
I didn't destroy the man.

04:14.320 --> 04:17.288
You did.

04:17.322 --> 04:22.693
Now, shall we return
to the business at hand?

04:22.728 --> 04:26.564
I'm planning a demonstration
of my resonator.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.600
I need you to send out
invitations to the press.

04:29.635 --> 04:33.337
Will that be a problem?

04:33.371 --> 04:35.205
No.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.574
There's a good lad.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.019
__

04:46.151 --> 04:48.718
You've seen this rubbish?

04:48.753 --> 04:50.987
Well, you must admit.
He's quite clever.

04:51.022 --> 04:52.722
- Good God, man.
- What?

04:52.757 --> 04:54.558
Are you saying
you admire the fellow?

04:54.592 --> 04:56.293
No. Certainly not.

04:56.327 --> 04:58.162
One just admires the game he plays.

04:58.196 --> 05:00.096
He thrusts, we parry.

05:00.131 --> 05:01.698
Grayson keeps us on the defensive.

05:01.732 --> 05:04.034
Then let's make him
run for a change.

05:04.068 --> 05:05.735
Our man at Scotland Yard,
Winthrop.

05:05.770 --> 05:07.971
Chief Inspector Morrow, sir.

05:08.005 --> 05:09.973
What are you going to do?

05:10.007 --> 05:12.241
Something not befitting a gentleman.

05:12.276 --> 05:15.344
- Oh, and Winthrop.
- Yes, sir.

05:15.379 --> 05:18.381
Perhaps it's time
we brought in Young Harker.

05:25.622 --> 05:28.591

www.addic7ed.com

05:52.805 --> 05:55.372
Now, you will
be careful in Budapest?

05:55.406 --> 05:58.574
If you wish, I can employ
some bodyguards to protect you.

05:58.609 --> 06:02.545
I'm perfectly capable
of defending myself, sir.

06:02.579 --> 06:04.281
Good.

06:06.483 --> 06:09.752
I would not trust
this task to anyone.

06:09.787 --> 06:13.155
After my father's castle
was sacked, priceless heirlooms

06:13.189 --> 06:15.991
that had been in my family
for centuries were lost.

06:16.026 --> 06:18.260
I would put a match to them all.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.129
All but one.

06:20.163 --> 06:23.733
Renfield, bring that
painting back to me.

06:23.767 --> 06:26.235
Bring her home.

06:54.797 --> 06:56.598
Four hours.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.969
My skills can afford you
no more than that yet.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.437
Really, Abraham?

07:02.471 --> 07:05.673
How humble you are to so readily
admit your limitation.

07:05.707 --> 07:07.475
Quite out of character.

07:07.509 --> 07:10.711
It is the improvement
you demanded, no?

07:10.745 --> 07:13.781
It is enough for now.

07:21.790 --> 07:25.192
Why do you abstain from blood?

07:25.226 --> 07:28.629
Did you think I of all people
wouldn't notice the symptoms?

07:28.663 --> 07:33.000
Miss Markham
served to heal my burns.

07:33.034 --> 07:35.335
But I have not fed since,

07:35.370 --> 07:37.770
and perhaps I never shall.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.906
Your infusion has changed me.

07:39.940 --> 07:42.309
I feel...reborn.

07:42.343 --> 07:44.011
A man once more.

07:44.045 --> 07:45.979
You deceive yourself.

07:46.014 --> 07:49.182
There's no...
cure for your hunger.

07:49.217 --> 07:51.183
You will always be its servant.

07:57.491 --> 07:59.959
I'm servant to no man.

08:35.061 --> 08:36.895
Miss Murray.

08:36.929 --> 08:38.328
- Oh.
- Five minutes early today.

08:38.364 --> 08:40.198
Mr. Grayson.

08:40.232 --> 08:41.799
Did I startle you?

08:41.832 --> 08:44.936
No. I was just...

08:44.970 --> 08:47.505
What in the world
are you doing here?

08:47.540 --> 08:49.240
Same as everyone else.

08:49.275 --> 08:51.543
Sunshine.

08:51.577 --> 08:54.979
It's a rare treat.

08:55.013 --> 08:58.015
May I?

09:02.921 --> 09:04.555
You know, it should be a crime

09:04.590 --> 09:06.323
not to smile
on so beautiful a day.

09:06.357 --> 09:09.627
So, what's troubling you?

09:09.661 --> 09:13.330
- If you'd rather not say, I...
- No, no, it's quite all right.

09:13.364 --> 09:16.400
I was assisting my father
on his rounds at hospital,

09:16.434 --> 09:18.235
and we had an argument.

09:18.269 --> 09:21.171
Life at Bethlem can be
relentlessly bleak.

09:21.206 --> 09:24.274
The days can be so monotonous.

09:24.309 --> 09:29.113
What if that kind of tedium
hinders their recovery?

09:29.147 --> 09:31.581
They should dance.

09:31.616 --> 09:32.949
What?

09:32.984 --> 09:35.051
Dance. Energy.

09:35.086 --> 09:37.721
Gets the blood pumping.

09:37.755 --> 09:40.256
What an idea.

09:40.290 --> 09:42.225
How did you ever think of that?

09:42.259 --> 09:43.559
I like to dance.

09:43.594 --> 09:45.428
Father does not.

09:45.462 --> 09:46.962
It might take some convincing.

09:46.997 --> 09:48.764
Oh, I'm sure you can be
very persuasive.

09:48.798 --> 09:50.333
And obstinate.

09:50.367 --> 09:54.036
One of my many flaws.
And yours?

09:56.806 --> 09:59.542
A long memory...

09:59.576 --> 10:01.977
Impatience...

10:02.012 --> 10:04.847
Envy.

10:04.881 --> 10:06.181
What could you possibly desire

10:06.215 --> 10:10.085
that is not already yours
for the taking?

10:28.070 --> 10:32.274
I see you got my flowers.

10:32.308 --> 10:35.544
I rang, but no one answered.

10:35.578 --> 10:38.146
- Jenkins?
- You know,

10:38.180 --> 10:41.015
I heard some sounds
coming from the pantry.

10:41.050 --> 10:43.785
I found Mr. Jenkins
seeing to your cook.

10:43.819 --> 10:45.519
Seeing to her?

10:45.554 --> 10:49.390
Vigorously seeing to her.

10:49.424 --> 10:51.859
Hm.

10:51.894 --> 10:53.960
You pricked your finger.

11:02.470 --> 11:04.538
Hm.

11:04.573 --> 11:08.409
Shall we go downstairs
and watch?

11:08.443 --> 11:10.476
No.

11:10.511 --> 11:11.878
Let's go upstairs.

11:23.157 --> 11:25.758
Oh...

11:25.792 --> 11:30.430
Oh, to have you here
in broad daylight, it's...

11:30.464 --> 11:34.467
it's quite decadent.

11:42.375 --> 11:44.977
What's wrong?

11:45.011 --> 11:47.246
It's my husband.

11:47.280 --> 11:49.448
He appears to have gotten
involved with the nurse

11:49.482 --> 11:52.417
who tends to him
at our country estate.

11:52.452 --> 11:55.320
That happens. Harmless enough.

11:55.355 --> 11:57.923
Yes, that's what
I thought at first, but, uh...

11:57.958 --> 12:00.359
silly old fool is claiming
he's in love with her.

12:00.393 --> 12:03.762
He's become quite brazen about it.

12:03.796 --> 12:06.197
I would reciprocate,
of course, but...

12:06.232 --> 12:08.833
But any damage inflicted
upon his reputation

12:08.868 --> 12:12.103
would in turn be
a strike against your own.

12:12.138 --> 12:14.239
It's a quandary.

12:16.708 --> 12:18.442
Tell me...

12:20.345 --> 12:23.014
What would you do
in my position, Alexander?

12:23.048 --> 12:26.450
I'd go after the object
of his affection.

12:26.485 --> 12:31.122
By wounding her...
you wound him.

12:44.202 --> 12:45.869
- A dance.
- A what?

12:45.904 --> 12:47.305
I know it's unconventional.

12:47.339 --> 12:48.672
That's an understatement.

12:48.706 --> 12:51.275
But father, a dance would
encourage socialization,

12:51.309 --> 12:54.011
and music has such
a power for healing.

12:54.045 --> 12:55.445
The men and women of this hospital

12:55.479 --> 12:57.380
live in separate wards
for good reason.

12:57.415 --> 12:59.283
In the past there have been
incidents of violence

12:59.317 --> 13:02.085
- and indecent behavior.
- Oh, God forbid!

13:02.120 --> 13:04.921
- Mina.
- Father.

13:04.955 --> 13:07.624
Most of these poor souls
will never return home.

13:07.658 --> 13:10.694
They have lost the simple pleasures
of leading their own lives.

13:10.728 --> 13:12.929
Can we not give them
one small reminder

13:12.963 --> 13:16.466
of the lives they've left behind?

13:16.500 --> 13:19.803
Not a penny may come
from the hospital budget.

14:24.767 --> 14:27.801
Sent invitations to every
newspaper as instructed.

14:27.835 --> 14:30.170
Excellent. And these are?

14:30.205 --> 14:32.806
Their refusals.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.441
What reason do they give?

14:34.475 --> 14:36.576
You.

14:36.611 --> 14:38.712
They say you're a charlatan
peddling snake oil,

14:38.746 --> 14:39.813
like P.T. Barnum.

14:41.582 --> 14:44.083
Like P.T. Barnum.

14:44.118 --> 14:48.288
Well, if they want a circus,
I'm gonna give 'em one.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.624
One they won't soon forget.

14:50.658 --> 14:54.294
__

14:54.328 --> 14:55.862
Come one! Come all!

14:55.897 --> 14:58.632
Come see the magnificent electricity!

14:58.666 --> 15:01.334
Drawn from the earth below
and sky above!

15:01.368 --> 15:04.037
You won't believe your eyes!

15:09.209 --> 15:11.911
Well, then, Harker.

15:11.946 --> 15:13.846
Now we have London's attention.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.882
Very soon we'll have the world's.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.822
Alexander, are you ill?

15:57.857 --> 15:59.256
No.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.126
Just had a little bit too much
to drink last night.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.788
Perhaps my age
is catching up to me.

16:23.184 --> 16:24.784
- Goodness.
- Well,

16:24.818 --> 16:27.354
they should be there,
with any luck.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.705
Come now, ladies and gentlemen.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.041
The Dresden triptych
now come to auction.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.376
For the 15th century's masterpiece

16:50.410 --> 16:54.246
I think we can go higher
than 140,000 coronas, no?

16:54.280 --> 16:55.747
Yes, madam.

16:55.781 --> 16:57.416
150,000 coronas.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.950
Do I have 175?

16:58.985 --> 17:01.320
There it is, madam.
Thank you very much.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.219
Do I have 200?

17:03.423 --> 17:04.489
It is yours, sir.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.824
225?

17:05.858 --> 17:07.592
I can see you, madam.
250?

17:07.627 --> 17:09.528
Yes again, sir, in the back.

17:09.561 --> 17:12.864
Do I have 275?

17:12.898 --> 17:14.398
No? Very well, then.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.701
Closing at 250,000 coronas.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.203
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- 1 million.

17:22.707 --> 17:24.474
Did you say, sir?

17:24.510 --> 17:28.879
1 million corona.
Payable in British sterling.

17:28.914 --> 17:32.750
Good lord.

17:32.784 --> 17:37.721
Dare I ask for
1 million, 100,000 coronas?

17:37.756 --> 17:39.023
Then sold.

17:39.057 --> 17:42.810
Dresden triptych
for 1 million coronas.

17:56.074 --> 18:00.444
Now it's my turn
to surprise you, Mr. Grayson.

18:00.478 --> 18:02.011
And so you have.

18:02.046 --> 18:03.680
I was preparing my speech

18:03.714 --> 18:06.749
for the demonstration
tomorrow night.

18:06.784 --> 18:09.686
- Harker isn't here.
- No. Um...

18:09.720 --> 18:11.921
I came to speak to you.

18:11.956 --> 18:13.155
Me?

18:13.190 --> 18:15.524
Well, in that case,
my speech can wait.

18:20.965 --> 18:23.365
Are you unwell?

18:23.400 --> 18:25.634
- You--You're perspiring.
- I've never been better.

18:25.668 --> 18:29.438
I assure you.
No need for concern.

18:29.473 --> 18:31.873
Everyone in London's been
talking about your big night.

18:33.610 --> 18:34.910
I'm glad the repairs
were successful.

18:34.944 --> 18:37.179
There's a seat reserved
for you at the front.

18:37.214 --> 18:39.148
Unfortunately,
I have another engagement.

18:39.182 --> 18:40.682
- Hmm.
- You see,

18:40.717 --> 18:42.951
father has consented
to a dance at the hospital.

18:42.986 --> 18:44.285
Brava.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.521
- Persuasive, indeed.
- Yes.

18:46.555 --> 18:48.223
And I wonder, would it be
terribly forward

18:48.257 --> 18:50.191
if I asked to borrow
your marvelous phonograph?

18:50.226 --> 18:52.293
It's quite a modest affair,

18:52.328 --> 18:54.362
but a dance isn't a dance
without music,

18:54.396 --> 18:57.766
- is it?
- I'll have it delivered.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.269
You shan't want for music.
Or anything.

19:01.303 --> 19:03.070
Thank you.

19:03.105 --> 19:06.040
How shall I ever repay
such kindness?

19:06.074 --> 19:08.075
Give me time, Miss Murray.

19:08.110 --> 19:10.945
I'm confident
I'll think of something.

19:12.615 --> 19:16.017
My dear, I'm sure you must
have mistaken Mina's reaction.

19:16.051 --> 19:18.218
No. You are wrong.

19:18.253 --> 19:19.920
You weren't there.
I know what I saw.

19:19.955 --> 19:21.321
And what was that?

19:21.356 --> 19:24.558
- Revulsion.
- No. What you saw was fear.

19:24.592 --> 19:26.493
No. You don't know her like I do.

19:26.528 --> 19:29.897
No, perhaps not,
but I know her type very well.

19:29.931 --> 19:31.698
Timid little creatures.

19:31.732 --> 19:34.201
Afraid of their own desires.

19:34.235 --> 19:37.937
See, you and I...
We're a different breed.

19:37.972 --> 19:42.075
We are brave. We are honest.

19:42.109 --> 19:46.813
Your friend's behavior has been
cowardly, frankly monstrous.

19:49.449 --> 19:52.819
- It was monstrous, wasn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

19:52.853 --> 19:56.089
Who knew she had
such venom in her?

19:56.123 --> 19:59.525
Truly she's cut me to the very bone.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.561
Clever Mina.

20:01.595 --> 20:03.930
She knows so much.

20:03.964 --> 20:06.832
She knows nothing of pain.

20:06.866 --> 20:09.702
Not as I do.

20:09.736 --> 20:12.071
How would she feel to be
let down by the one she loves?

20:12.105 --> 20:13.406
By Jonathan?

20:13.440 --> 20:17.543
Well, that would be
a terrible lesson, indeed.

20:17.578 --> 20:20.580
Yes. Yes, it would.

20:46.071 --> 20:48.473
This spectacle tomorrow
evening, you've heard of it?

20:48.507 --> 20:49.841
Of course I have.

20:49.875 --> 20:53.511
Half the boys of the yard
have requested off to be there.

20:53.546 --> 20:54.846
Chief Inspector Morrow,

20:54.880 --> 20:59.483
the Order requires your services
and your discretion.

20:59.517 --> 21:02.386
Thank you.

21:02.420 --> 21:05.957
Initial test holds steady.
All seems to be in order.

21:05.991 --> 21:08.459
Have you written your speech yet?

21:08.493 --> 21:12.129
Kowalski, this roller
chain's covered in rust.

21:12.163 --> 21:15.165
- I don't see any rust.
- Just fix it!

21:15.199 --> 21:16.767
You're not looking well.

21:16.801 --> 21:21.472
I would tread very carefully
if I were you, professor.

21:21.506 --> 21:25.108
This evening our revenge
rests on your shoulders,

21:25.143 --> 21:28.078
yet you look too weak
to shoulder your own garments!

21:28.112 --> 21:29.913
You will have your revenge.

21:29.947 --> 21:32.015
When we crush them,
we both will.

21:32.049 --> 21:33.817
But the greater measure
of mine is to defy

21:33.851 --> 21:36.452
this blasted curse
they've placed on my head.

21:36.487 --> 21:38.188
I will not kill.

21:38.222 --> 21:40.157
I will not feed.

21:40.191 --> 21:43.093
I will live as a man
or not at all.

21:44.493 --> 21:46.470
You're a virgin, aren't you?

21:48.339 --> 21:50.212
I've seen you flirt.

21:50.245 --> 21:53.274
You wear your inexperience
like a cheap rouge.

21:53.281 --> 21:55.282
Now you're just being cruel.

21:55.317 --> 21:58.718
You know, all young ladies
preen like peacocks,

21:58.753 --> 22:00.720
thinking that the loudest
and the brightest

22:00.755 --> 22:03.857
will draw the man's eye.

22:03.891 --> 22:06.760
But any streetwalker
can simper and giggle.

22:06.794 --> 22:09.729
I will teach you

22:09.764 --> 22:12.632
how to haunt Jonathan's dreams.

22:12.667 --> 22:16.736
You see, a woman's power isn't
in her beauty or her smile

22:16.771 --> 22:18.304
but in her mind,

22:18.339 --> 22:20.440
and the best application of yours

22:20.474 --> 22:25.744
will be in capturing
Jonathan's five senses.

22:26.981 --> 22:29.548
Touch.

22:29.583 --> 22:33.219
Your fingertips across his arm,

22:33.253 --> 22:36.856
his chest, his cheek.

22:36.890 --> 22:39.157
Scent.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.459
Memories of summer

22:40.494 --> 22:45.163
reminding him of the warm sun
on his naked skin.

22:47.033 --> 22:50.836
Sound. Your laugh.

22:50.871 --> 22:55.607
Light and gentle
like a crystal bell.

22:57.977 --> 23:01.246
Sight.

23:01.280 --> 23:04.983
A look that lingers

23:05.018 --> 23:10.021
and promises so much more.

23:11.590 --> 23:14.325
And finally...

23:14.359 --> 23:16.293
Yes?

23:16.328 --> 23:19.664
Go on.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.100
Taste.

23:31.309 --> 23:34.045
Wield these blades wisely,

23:34.079 --> 23:35.279
my dear,

23:35.313 --> 23:38.615
and Jonathan will be
an easy kill.

24:20.023 --> 24:24.493
I am sorry to scare you, Miss,
but no cleaning today, please.

24:24.527 --> 24:27.830
Yes, sir.
Beg your pardon, sir.

25:08.470 --> 25:11.272
Good afternoon, sister.

25:11.306 --> 25:13.341
Just some flowers for the dance.

25:25.486 --> 25:27.855
Lucy, this is all very unnecessary.

25:27.889 --> 25:29.456
I'm more than capable of choosing

25:29.490 --> 25:31.391
- my own wedding garments.
- I know the chaps

25:31.425 --> 25:33.093
are all wearing ivory
wedding gloves now,

25:33.128 --> 25:36.830
but they're back
to lavender in Paris.

25:38.499 --> 25:42.702
- You seem well, considering.
- Considering what?

25:42.736 --> 25:44.504
The other night.

25:44.539 --> 25:49.409
Mina told me
why you were so upset.

25:49.443 --> 25:51.878
Alistair.

25:51.912 --> 25:53.213
I'm so sorry.

25:53.247 --> 25:55.381
Oh, yes. Of course.

25:55.415 --> 25:57.416
It's for the best.
He wasn't exactly my type.

25:57.450 --> 25:59.752
Hm.

25:59.787 --> 26:01.554
Did she say anything else?

26:01.588 --> 26:04.323
No. Why?

26:06.126 --> 26:08.661
Oh, no, no, no.
You poor lamb.

26:08.696 --> 26:11.697
Allow me.

26:19.138 --> 26:21.106
I insist.

26:55.641 --> 26:57.742
Well done.

27:13.291 --> 27:14.992
Pies fresh today!
Fresh this morning.

27:15.026 --> 27:16.360
Right out of the oven.

27:16.394 --> 27:19.696
- Do you mind if I...
- No. Just go ahead. Go on.

27:19.731 --> 27:22.766
Fresh pies, fresh pies,
fresh today!

27:35.579 --> 27:37.680
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

28:02.790 --> 28:04.490
Allow me.

28:15.535 --> 28:17.469
Start at the beginning.

28:21.374 --> 28:24.509
- Any trouble?
- Nothing I couldn't handle.

28:54.306 --> 28:58.608
So who do you love most,
Alexander Grayson?

28:58.643 --> 29:01.979
Mina Murray.

29:08.486 --> 29:11.822
I'll be back shortly.

29:25.570 --> 29:28.471
Mr. Jonathan Harker?

29:28.505 --> 29:30.673
- Yes?
- Come on behalf

29:30.707 --> 29:34.177
of Mr. Browning...
He'd like a word with you at once.

29:34.211 --> 29:36.379
Well, a letter would have sufficed.

29:36.413 --> 29:37.947
As it is, I'm just on my way...

29:37.982 --> 29:40.183
Demonstration.
Yes. He's aware.

29:40.217 --> 29:42.585
He asked but a moment, please?

29:42.619 --> 29:45.053
And if I refuse?

29:45.088 --> 29:48.591
Make the task at hand
a great deal messier, sir.

30:09.812 --> 30:12.580
Please remain seated,
Mr. Harker,

30:12.615 --> 30:15.217
or we shall be forced
to restrain you.

30:15.251 --> 30:16.951
Mr. Browning.

30:16.986 --> 30:18.653
Correct.

30:18.687 --> 30:22.189
I am here.

30:22.224 --> 30:24.859
Although, if you ever
allege that I was,

30:24.894 --> 30:27.194
I have four
unimpeachable witnesses

30:27.229 --> 30:29.397
who will testify under oath
that I am at present

30:29.431 --> 30:32.633
dining at the Gresham Club.

30:32.667 --> 30:34.535
What is this about?
Why am I here?

30:34.569 --> 30:36.737
I merely wish
to present you to my colleagues,

30:36.771 --> 30:39.873
who shall remain anonymous
for the time being.

30:39.908 --> 30:41.575
- Your colleagues?
- Ah, yes.

30:41.609 --> 30:44.078
Welcome, Mr. Harker,

30:44.112 --> 30:46.780
to the Order of the Dragon.

30:48.550 --> 30:51.885
And with daisies from the garden.
Not a single penny was spent.

30:51.920 --> 30:54.888
It might not be the ballroom
at Chatsworth but it should do.

30:54.923 --> 30:56.389
Admirably resourceful, my dear.

30:56.424 --> 30:59.026
And Mr. Grayson's
phonograph should be here, too.

30:59.060 --> 31:01.161
Ah.

31:03.197 --> 31:06.533
Do you hear that?

31:20.448 --> 31:22.949
As you requested, Miss Murray.

31:22.983 --> 31:24.316
Your music.

31:24.350 --> 31:25.451
Dr. Murray.

31:27.821 --> 31:31.523
May I trouble you
for this dance, my lady?

31:50.943 --> 31:54.480
Every man in this room
has sworn an oath

31:54.514 --> 31:57.616
that he will give up his life
in order to serve God's word.

31:57.650 --> 32:00.952
Are you such a man, Mr. Harker?

32:00.987 --> 32:03.655
Are you one of us?
Would you make that sacrifice?

32:03.689 --> 32:06.858
In the face of a threat?
Yes. Without hesitation.

32:06.892 --> 32:10.996
Even as we speak,
such a threat exists.

32:11.030 --> 32:14.298
An ancient enemy...

32:14.333 --> 32:18.969
The heathens now
known as the Ottomans.

32:19.004 --> 32:21.872
The Ottomans sit on a sea of oil.

32:21.906 --> 32:24.575
If we do not secure those
reserves for England

32:24.610 --> 32:27.145
and the West
then soon, very soon,

32:27.179 --> 32:29.980
with the turn of the spigot,
they will have

32:30.015 --> 32:32.349
the power to shut down
Western industry,

32:32.383 --> 32:34.018
and when we are defenseless

32:34.052 --> 32:37.621
their hordes
will rise up and crush us.

32:37.656 --> 32:41.659
But...

32:41.693 --> 32:43.426
If I may?

32:47.298 --> 32:48.731
Please.

32:48.766 --> 32:51.934
If what you say is true,
then Mr. Grayson's energy scheme

32:51.969 --> 32:55.805
will utterly strip the Ottomans
of their greatest weapon.

32:55.839 --> 32:59.209
With geomagnetic power,
we'll have no need for oil.

32:59.243 --> 33:01.510
Grayson's technology is a dead end.

33:01.545 --> 33:04.147
A distraction,
and if it continues,

33:04.181 --> 33:06.348
one that may prove deadly.

33:06.383 --> 33:09.185
We cannot afford to be led astray
by a latter-day pied piper

33:09.219 --> 33:13.956
whose interests begin and end
with lining his own pockets.

33:13.991 --> 33:17.193
- It is our duty to stop him.
- But...

33:17.227 --> 33:19.728
We need your help.

33:21.898 --> 33:24.300
You'd have me play Judas?

33:24.334 --> 33:27.369
To bring down a false messiah,
yes, and in return,

33:27.404 --> 33:31.139
power and connections
that would ensure

33:31.174 --> 33:33.875
the brightest of futures
for you and Miss Murray.

33:33.910 --> 33:35.977
Join us, Mr. Harker.

33:36.012 --> 33:39.981
Help us to win this Holy War
once and for all.

34:28.630 --> 34:30.929
You're not leaving already.

34:30.965 --> 34:34.100
Forgive me.
The demonstration.

34:34.135 --> 34:35.768
Tell Harker I'll see him there.

34:35.803 --> 34:37.871
But it doesn't start
for another hour,

34:37.905 --> 34:40.739
and Jonathan's not here,
although he promised.

34:43.244 --> 34:46.545
I'm sure you'll have no trouble
finding another partner to dance with.

34:46.580 --> 34:48.915
I already have.

34:48.949 --> 34:52.485
Miss Murray,
what would people say?

34:52.518 --> 34:55.789
What people?

34:58.725 --> 35:00.660
Dance with me.

35:32.658 --> 35:34.292
- There you go, sir.
- Here we are.

35:34.327 --> 35:35.527
And one for you.

35:35.561 --> 35:37.094
There's one for you, sir,
and you, ma'am.

35:37.129 --> 35:40.799
Thank you very much.
And one for you, sir.

35:46.038 --> 35:47.839
- Where is he?
- I think they gave me

35:47.873 --> 35:49.907
- the wrong one.
- Where is he?

35:57.716 --> 36:02.386
I've never seen them so happy,
and all because of you.

36:02.420 --> 36:04.988
They only have you
to thank for it.

36:05.022 --> 36:09.259
Why, any flower would blossom
under your care.

36:15.132 --> 36:17.901
You flatter me.

36:17.935 --> 36:20.003
Does that make you uncomfortable?

36:20.037 --> 36:22.739
Yes.

36:22.773 --> 36:24.841
Should I stop?

36:26.210 --> 36:28.044
No.

36:57.374 --> 36:58.873
Your hands.

36:58.908 --> 37:01.609
Your hands are trembling.

37:24.566 --> 37:27.568
Forgive me.

38:07.683 --> 38:09.017
What's happening?

38:09.051 --> 38:11.253
Nothing. That's the problem.

38:11.287 --> 38:13.087
Your boss is a no-show.

38:20.129 --> 38:22.697
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have reason to believe

38:22.731 --> 38:26.467
that this machine
is a threat to public safety,

38:26.501 --> 38:29.503
so if you'll all please
move towards the exit

38:29.538 --> 38:32.106
in an orderly fashion.

38:32.141 --> 38:34.108
Thank you.

38:34.143 --> 38:37.678
Ladies and gentlemen,
move along.

38:46.821 --> 38:49.823
Quick as you can, ladies and gents.

38:51.226 --> 38:53.827
Shut it down! Pack it all up.

38:53.861 --> 38:55.962
I want all this confiscated.

39:00.434 --> 39:02.969
This is private property!
You have no right!

39:03.004 --> 39:05.172
Next door there are over
a hundred souls sick as dogs

39:05.206 --> 39:07.640
not days after this infernal
machine was constructed.

39:07.675 --> 39:09.076
That's impossible!

39:09.110 --> 39:11.077
This poses absolutely
no health risks!

39:11.111 --> 39:12.445
Tell that to the mum
with the baby in her arms

39:12.479 --> 39:14.046
who's spittin' up blood.

39:14.081 --> 39:16.949
Clearly you're not above
being paid for your services,

39:16.983 --> 39:21.887
so how much to double
whoever's paid you off?

39:21.922 --> 39:23.623
Get your damn hands off her!

39:24.758 --> 39:26.125
Get out!

39:26.159 --> 39:28.327
Go away!

39:28.361 --> 39:29.528
Come on!
Come on.

39:35.702 --> 39:37.436
Come along! Move. Move.

39:37.470 --> 39:40.472
Come on.

39:59.925 --> 40:03.061
I'm so sorry.

40:03.095 --> 40:07.598
I know I should have been here.

40:32.724 --> 40:36.059
Take me home.

40:42.801 --> 40:44.201
Paul.

40:45.837 --> 40:47.971
Paul!

40:49.107 --> 40:52.241
You should have taken the money.

40:53.744 --> 40:55.344
Aah!

41:34.818 --> 41:38.854
Off for a little lip, were we?

41:38.888 --> 41:43.358
My savagery pales
in comparison to yours.

41:43.392 --> 41:48.363
You won't drag me back into
this world that had forsaken me.

41:48.397 --> 41:51.532
You, who cheated me
with the vaccine

41:51.567 --> 41:55.403
that gives me but the taste
of the life I can never have.

41:55.437 --> 41:58.840
You, who gave me hope.

42:00.942 --> 42:05.045
You're more of a monster
than I am,

42:05.080 --> 42:07.915
and someday...

42:07.949 --> 42:11.151
I will kill you for it.

42:24.171 --> 42:29.894
