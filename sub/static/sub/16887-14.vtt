00:20.447 --> 00:22.915
Get up!
- I'm actually good down here.

00:22.983 --> 00:25.007
Grow up,
Morgan Grimes!

00:25.152 --> 00:26.753
You were spying on me
in gym class.

00:26.820 --> 00:27.954
I'm going to kick your...

00:28.022 --> 00:29.022
Help!

00:35.162 --> 00:36.996
Don't worry, Morgan.
I got your back.

00:38.132 --> 00:39.032
Suzy,

00:39.099 --> 00:40.166
I'll take it from here.

00:40.234 --> 00:42.001
Morgan, maybe

00:42.069 --> 00:44.037
you should stay away
from girls, for, like,

00:44.104 --> 00:46.239
15 years?

00:46.306 --> 00:50.043
All right,
check it out.

00:50.110 --> 00:51.878
A picture
of your ex-girlfriend?

00:51.945 --> 00:53.212
That.. that's why I had

00:53.280 --> 00:55.114
to come in here
on my coffee break?

00:55.182 --> 00:57.717
Anna Melinda Wu.

00:57.785 --> 01:00.153
Five - two, 96 pounds,
of Chinese descent.

01:00.220 --> 01:03.556
Why-why... why are we in here
talking about your ex?

01:03.624 --> 01:04.623
Because today,

01:04.691 --> 01:05.925
I need your help

01:05.993 --> 01:06.959
on a mission.

01:07.027 --> 01:08.561
What kind of mission?

01:08.629 --> 01:10.663
A spy mission, Charles.
- Can you handle it?

01:10.731 --> 01:12.465
You see, I'm afraid

01:12.533 --> 01:14.200
Anna may be seeing a new guy.

01:14.268 --> 01:15.768
Whoa! Whoa!
Hey, time out.

01:15.836 --> 01:17.303
You want me to spy on Anna?

01:17.371 --> 01:19.772
Course not, Chuck. You'd be
there for moral support.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.641
You're not skilled in
spy-craft. No, that's where

01:21.708 --> 01:22.708
Lester and
Jeff come in.

01:22.776 --> 01:23.976
Does it shock you

01:24.044 --> 01:25.578
that 80%
of my encounters with women

01:25.646 --> 01:28.548
have been completely
without their knowledge?

01:28.615 --> 01:32.018
Honestly, I'm more surprised
by the other 20%, Jeff.

01:32.086 --> 01:33.419
Look, buddy, I know you're going
through a tough time,

01:33.487 --> 01:35.354
but I just don't
feel comfortable stalking

01:35.422 --> 01:36.322
another human being.

01:36.390 --> 01:37.990
Dude, it's not stalking, okay?

01:38.058 --> 01:40.560
It's caring enough about someone
to learn things about them

01:40.627 --> 01:41.828
they won't tell
you themselves.

01:41.895 --> 01:43.096
Which is stalking.

01:43.163 --> 01:44.797
And I really need
you on this one,

01:44.865 --> 01:45.865
so...

01:47.634 --> 01:51.537
Please, Devon,
I really need you.

01:51.605 --> 01:53.473
Only got a couple minutes
before I got to get to work,

01:53.540 --> 01:54.874
but if you don't mind
a little drive-thru

01:54.942 --> 01:56.375
when you're used
to fine dining...

01:56.443 --> 01:57.810
No. No, no, no.

01:57.878 --> 02:00.179
No. Not-not for that.
I just... I need your help.

02:00.247 --> 02:02.115
This is our to-do
list for our wedding.

02:02.182 --> 02:04.417
Ooh. Less fun.
- There's just not enough hours

02:04.485 --> 02:06.219
in the day for me
to do everything myself,

02:06.286 --> 02:08.187
plus work night shifts,
and plus be a sister

02:08.255 --> 02:09.489
and a friend and a girlfriend...

02:09.556 --> 02:10.389
FiancÃ©e.

02:10.457 --> 02:12.391
My point is, is that I need you

02:12.459 --> 02:14.260
to start pulling your weight
around here, okay?

02:14.328 --> 02:16.896
So you can deal
with the flowers,

02:16.964 --> 02:18.464
the music and the cake.

02:18.532 --> 02:19.699
I will handle the rest.

02:19.766 --> 02:22.135
Babe. Babe.

02:22.202 --> 02:23.536
A marriage is
a partnership.

02:23.604 --> 02:25.705
A wedding
should be, too.

02:25.772 --> 02:27.607
Okay.

02:40.020 --> 02:42.989
Whoa! What is this place?

02:43.056 --> 02:45.825
Whatever our friend Jeffery here
doesn't guzzle down his throat,

02:45.893 --> 02:47.026
He spends on spy gear.

02:47.094 --> 02:48.060
Incredible, right?

02:48.128 --> 02:49.595
Incredibly creepy.

02:49.663 --> 02:50.963
Hey, ladies, let's go.

02:51.031 --> 02:52.465
Man your posts.

03:01.508 --> 03:03.209
Babysitting the freak show.

03:03.277 --> 03:04.677
This should be enlightening.

03:11.785 --> 03:14.487
Ah, we have visual acquisition
of the target.

03:14.555 --> 03:15.955
We got ears on.

03:19.226 --> 03:20.993
Subject is on the move.

03:41.415 --> 03:42.682
Guys. Guys,
we can't do this.

03:42.749 --> 03:44.283
We shouldn't be doing this
right now.

03:44.351 --> 03:46.852
I mean, we're,
like crazy stalkers.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.621
Shh! Charles, please!

03:48.689 --> 03:50.122
What the hell are these crazy

03:50.190 --> 03:52.124
stalkers up to?

03:52.192 --> 03:54.560
Looks like some
pretty decent spy work.

03:54.628 --> 03:55.828
Would you just stop
and think

03:55.896 --> 03:57.330
about what you're doing
for a second?

03:57.397 --> 03:58.497
Chuck, I know exactly
what I'm doing, brother.

03:58.565 --> 03:59.732
I'm getting answers, man.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.400
Yeah, but there are other ways
of doing that.

04:01.468 --> 04:03.202
Yeah. No. Absolutely.

04:03.270 --> 04:05.271
We tried cloning Anna's cell,
but she's got a CDMA carrier,

04:05.339 --> 04:06.405
so we couldn't
copy the SIM card.

04:09.610 --> 04:11.444
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Here. There's a guy.

04:11.511 --> 04:12.411
There's a guy
just showed up.

04:12.479 --> 04:13.346
Quick. Let me see.
Let me see.

04:14.548 --> 04:16.449
Ooh.

04:16.516 --> 04:17.950
Maybe it's her brother.

04:21.822 --> 04:22.788
Oh.

04:22.856 --> 04:23.756
Still,

04:23.824 --> 04:24.857
could be her brother.

04:24.925 --> 04:25.958
All right.

04:26.026 --> 04:27.193
Let's back it up.
Abort mission.

04:27.261 --> 04:28.661
I mean, I can't compete
with this guy, Chuck.

04:28.729 --> 04:30.229
He's got healthy hair,

04:30.297 --> 04:31.964
a clean smile
and a killer car.

04:40.907 --> 04:42.074
Look at him.

04:42.142 --> 04:43.709
I mean,

04:43.777 --> 04:45.978
he's my worst nightmare!

04:46.046 --> 04:49.315
Yeah. I'd trust
your instincts, pal.

04:49.383 --> 04:50.883
Uh, the general
will be available

04:50.951 --> 04:53.019
to talk about the Jason Wang
situation momentarily.

04:53.086 --> 04:55.588
Hey, how come you guys
have these in here anyway?

04:55.656 --> 04:56.956
I mean, do you play?

04:57.024 --> 04:58.224
They're not toys, Chuck.

04:58.292 --> 04:59.892
If you pop the top, they are

04:59.960 --> 05:01.527
white phosphorous grenades.
They can melt iron.

05:01.595 --> 05:03.329
Okeydokey.

05:03.397 --> 05:05.831
What are these,
mini flamethrowers?

05:05.899 --> 05:07.833
Uh. Mint-flavored
knockout spray.

05:07.901 --> 05:10.803
Oh! Really? Do you think
I can have one of these?

05:10.871 --> 05:13.239
'Cause I'm always, you know,
really vulnerable out there.

05:14.608 --> 05:16.876
Jason Wang,
Anna Wu's new boyfriend.

05:16.943 --> 05:18.177
Wang's a car importer,

05:18.245 --> 05:19.979
and while
he has no criminal record,

05:20.047 --> 05:23.115
he runs with a dangerous crew
of local Triad gangsters.

05:23.183 --> 05:25.451
A gang responsible
for smuggling guns, drugs

05:25.519 --> 05:27.053
and other weapons in
and out of Los Angeles.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.521
Correct, Agent Walker.

05:28.588 --> 05:30.456
We've been watching
the local Triad for a while,

05:30.524 --> 05:31.991
but didn't know
about Wang's involvement

05:32.059 --> 05:33.125
before Chuck's flash.

05:33.193 --> 05:35.194
Well, you're welcome.

05:35.262 --> 05:36.796
You really don't have
to thank me.

05:36.863 --> 05:38.130
Not-not that
you are thanking me.

05:38.198 --> 05:39.465
I guess you're
really just kind of

05:39.533 --> 05:40.866
making a statement. Continue.

05:40.934 --> 05:42.234
Your mission is
to determine the depth

05:42.302 --> 05:44.136
of Wang's connection to Triad.

05:44.204 --> 05:45.438
Chuck, use
your social connection

05:45.505 --> 05:47.406
to infiltrate the suspect.

05:47.474 --> 05:50.676
Um, excuse me, General,

05:50.744 --> 05:52.845
but just-just to
clarify-- you want me

05:52.913 --> 05:55.748
to befriend my best friend's
ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend?

05:55.816 --> 05:58.150
Is there a problem,
Mr. Bartowski?

05:58.218 --> 06:00.052
No. Nope.

06:00.120 --> 06:03.155
No. Not a... Not a problem.

06:06.927 --> 06:09.895
I got a big problem here.

06:27.781 --> 06:29.415
# na-na na-na na-na #

06:29.483 --> 06:32.351
# na-na na-na
na-na #

06:32.419 --> 06:33.786
# na-na na-na na-na #

06:33.854 --> 06:35.454
# na-na na-na
na-na #

06:35.522 --> 06:37.189
# na-na na-na na-na #

06:37.257 --> 06:40.426
# na-na na-na
na-na. #

06:59.666 --> 07:01.567
Sleep well last night, Chuck?

07:01.634 --> 07:02.968
What?

07:05.772 --> 07:07.539
Actually, no.
I was having

07:07.607 --> 07:09.975
nightmares about
people spying on me,

07:10.043 --> 07:12.811
Which-which... which
now feels all too real.

07:12.879 --> 07:14.313
My point was

07:14.381 --> 07:16.348
that while
you were still here asleep,

07:16.416 --> 07:18.016
I'm just now
getting home from work.

07:18.084 --> 07:20.085
Tough night.
Saving lives

07:20.153 --> 07:22.121
can get pretty gnarly sometimes.

07:22.188 --> 07:24.223
Tell me about it.

07:24.290 --> 07:27.092
So, what are your plans
for today?

07:27.160 --> 07:30.229
Uh, well, you know, I mean,
I-I probably have to go to work.

07:30.296 --> 07:31.630
You know?
- Mm.

07:31.698 --> 07:34.333
And, uh, I-I might get a
pizza with Sarah afterwards

07:34.401 --> 07:35.701
or something, you know?

07:35.769 --> 07:37.536
Cakewalk, huh?

07:37.604 --> 07:39.104
Considering your mellow skedge,

07:39.172 --> 07:42.741
what do you say, you help out
your soon-to-be brother-in-law?

07:42.809 --> 07:45.110
What'd you have in mind?

07:45.178 --> 07:47.279
Ellie wants me to find a band
for the wedding,

07:47.347 --> 07:48.947
and I know how much
you love music,

07:49.015 --> 07:51.083
and how busy I am.

07:51.151 --> 07:52.985
So, I was thinking, this
could be a win-win situation

07:53.052 --> 07:54.486
for both of us.

07:54.554 --> 07:57.790
You want <i>me</i> to find a
band for your wedding?

07:57.857 --> 07:59.391
That'd be awesome, dude.

07:59.459 --> 08:01.527
Thanks a lot.

08:01.594 --> 08:04.596
<i>I can't do this.</i>

08:04.664 --> 08:06.331
How can the General ask me
to do this?

08:06.399 --> 08:08.500
I mean, was the woman born
with stars on her shoulders?

08:08.568 --> 08:09.902
Has she never <i>had</i> a friend
before?

08:09.969 --> 08:11.537
I can't just go and hang out

08:11.604 --> 08:13.272
with my best friend's ex
and her new boyfriend

08:13.339 --> 08:14.540
like it's no big deal!

08:14.607 --> 08:16.108
I understand
that this may be difficult

08:16.176 --> 08:17.676
for you with regard to Morgan...

08:17.744 --> 08:19.211
No. No, no, no, no.
No, not difficult.

08:19.279 --> 08:20.579
Not happening!

08:20.647 --> 08:22.247
Morgan has been my best
friend since kindergarten.

08:22.315 --> 08:24.450
I don't even know what
he would do if he found out.

08:24.517 --> 08:25.751
I'm sorry, Chuck,
but this is not an optional.

08:25.819 --> 08:27.019
It's a direct order.

08:27.086 --> 08:28.187
I can't betray
my best friend!

08:28.254 --> 08:29.521
How come nobody gets that?!

08:29.589 --> 08:31.323
Hmm. Semper Fidelis.

08:32.759 --> 08:33.792
It means, "always faithful"
in the Marines.

08:35.195 --> 08:36.595
In civilian life, it means

08:36.663 --> 08:38.897
putting your friend's well-being
above your own, huh?

08:38.965 --> 08:40.299
I salute you for that,
Bartowski.

08:40.366 --> 08:41.866
Well done.

08:41.934 --> 08:43.202
Yeah. That's...

08:43.269 --> 08:45.537
Thanks, Casey. Yeah,
Semper Fi. Semper Fi.

08:45.605 --> 08:48.006
You know, it's a pretty upside
down world when this guy's

08:48.074 --> 08:49.775
the one picking up on the
emotional nuances around here.

08:51.644 --> 08:52.945
All right,
let's go tell the General.

08:53.012 --> 08:54.813
Yeah, but as much as I
respect your Code of Honor,

08:54.881 --> 08:56.048
there's nothing
I can do about it.

08:56.115 --> 08:58.317
Orders before honor
this time, Bartowski.

08:58.384 --> 09:00.786
Go befriend Anna's
new boyfriend.

09:05.592 --> 09:08.160
So, um, how would you...

09:08.228 --> 09:10.329
How would you categorize
your music?

09:10.396 --> 09:12.097
I me, who-who are kind of

09:12.165 --> 09:13.565
your more major influences?

09:13.633 --> 09:15.267
Uh-huh.

09:15.335 --> 09:17.569
You know, I'm actually
not familiar

09:17.637 --> 09:19.371
with your Uncle Max's
klezmer band.

09:19.439 --> 09:21.006
So, thank you anyway.

09:22.308 --> 09:23.609
What was that about?

09:23.676 --> 09:25.911
I'm helping Ellie
and awesome find a band

09:25.979 --> 09:27.246
for their wedding.

09:28.548 --> 09:32.217
Then this, sir,
is your lucky day.

09:32.285 --> 09:34.319
We'll handle it from here.

09:34.387 --> 09:35.754
You're going
to help me find a band?

09:35.822 --> 09:36.955
Oh, no, no, no, no,
you misunderstand.

09:37.023 --> 09:39.825
You've found your
band. It is we.

09:39.893 --> 09:41.260
We'll play your
sister's big day.

09:43.897 --> 09:45.197
Um, wait. Wait a minute.

09:45.265 --> 09:46.298
You guys have a band?

09:47.901 --> 09:48.433
Jeff.

09:48.501 --> 09:50.702
Lester...

09:50.770 --> 09:52.170
Jeffster!
- Jeffster!

09:52.238 --> 09:53.839
That seems very fitting.

09:53.907 --> 09:55.541
Originally, we were going to go
with the name Jester,

09:55.608 --> 09:57.309
but we didn't want people

09:57.377 --> 09:58.777
To associate us
with a couple of fools.

09:58.845 --> 10:00.779
Obviously not.

10:00.847 --> 10:02.548
So, what'd you do last night?

10:02.615 --> 10:03.982
Went out.

10:04.050 --> 10:05.551
Mm-hmm.

10:05.618 --> 10:06.818
Where'd you go?

10:06.886 --> 10:09.488
Please. I'm with a customer.

10:09.556 --> 10:11.823
I mean, did you go by yourself?

10:11.891 --> 10:12.791
Um...

10:12.859 --> 10:14.493
Yeah, my sister--

10:14.561 --> 10:16.428
Her taste runs
a little more classic.

10:16.496 --> 10:17.629
But you haven't heard us.

10:17.697 --> 10:19.264
Charles, I'd hate to think

10:19.332 --> 10:20.165
you'd prejudge us.

10:20.233 --> 10:21.366
Don't be a musical bigot.

10:22.902 --> 10:23.902
Um,

10:23.970 --> 10:25.404
I'm sorry, but the answer's no.

10:25.471 --> 10:27.706
It just is no.
It's a flat-out no. I'm sorry.

10:31.644 --> 10:34.780
I'm seeing someone,
okay, Morgan?

10:34.847 --> 10:36.782
Well, well, well.

10:36.849 --> 10:38.750
The truth comes out.

10:38.818 --> 10:40.686
A new man, or...
or am I assuming something here?

10:40.753 --> 10:42.988
I mean, it is a man, right?

10:43.056 --> 10:45.490
Because we all know about
your very, very colorful past.

10:45.558 --> 10:46.658
God, grow up, Morgan.

10:46.726 --> 10:47.793
Oh, please.

10:47.860 --> 10:49.027
Hey. Hey, buddy.

10:49.095 --> 10:50.796
There are some customers
over in refrigerators

10:50.863 --> 10:52.164
that might need some helping.

10:52.231 --> 10:54.433
All right, I clocked out
a couple hours ago,

10:54.500 --> 10:56.368
so I'm on my own time here.

10:56.436 --> 10:57.736
Enough... buddy.

10:57.804 --> 10:59.671
You should probably go.

11:01.007 --> 11:02.908
All right, well,

11:02.976 --> 11:04.810
I-I hope you
and your new boyfriend

11:04.877 --> 11:06.545
are very unhappy together.

11:08.514 --> 11:11.283
I'm sorry about Morgan.

11:11.351 --> 11:14.386
You've spent your whole
life apologizing for him.

11:14.454 --> 11:15.587
Don't you get it?

11:15.655 --> 11:17.389
He's never going
to grow up.

11:17.457 --> 11:20.058
There's a million reasons
to love him,

11:20.126 --> 11:22.928
but unfortunately
maturity is not on that list.

11:24.464 --> 11:27.366
So I hear-- I heard

11:27.433 --> 11:29.401
that you have a new guy,
new boyfriend...

11:29.469 --> 11:31.003
or whatever.

11:31.070 --> 11:33.071
Jason's great,

11:33.139 --> 11:36.141
plus an evening out doesn't
involve me on his handlebars

11:36.209 --> 11:37.876
and the Taco Bell drive-thru.

11:37.944 --> 11:39.111
Know what you mean.

11:39.178 --> 11:41.046
I've been riding
on those handlebars for years.

11:45.918 --> 11:48.020
Hey, how would you like to go

11:48.087 --> 11:50.756
on a double date or
something sometime?

11:50.823 --> 11:51.923
Really?

11:51.991 --> 11:53.558
Yeah.

11:53.626 --> 11:55.627
Jason's having a party
tonight at his showroom.

11:55.695 --> 11:57.362
I mean, only thing
more expensive

11:57.430 --> 11:58.730
than the champagne
will be the cars.

11:58.798 --> 12:00.065
You and Sarah should stop by.

12:00.133 --> 12:01.433
Sounds great.

12:01.501 --> 12:03.402
Yeah, can't wait to meet
your new boyfriend.

12:03.469 --> 12:04.870
Okay.

12:04.937 --> 12:06.004
Wow.

12:06.072 --> 12:07.572
Good job.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.207
I hate you.

12:09.275 --> 12:11.810
I can't believe I have
to meet her new boyfriend.

12:11.878 --> 12:13.712
Chuck and I will enter
as our cover couple,

12:13.780 --> 12:15.113
get close to Wang...

12:15.181 --> 12:17.783
see if the skin-covered robot
flashes on anything...

12:17.850 --> 12:19.985
What, is that supposed
to be me? That's real nice.

12:20.053 --> 12:22.120
Figure out any connection
Wang has to the Triad...

12:22.188 --> 12:23.889
try to plant this GLG-20.

12:23.956 --> 12:25.390
I'll be in the van monitoring
your activity.

12:25.458 --> 12:26.758
All set?
Let's go.

12:26.826 --> 12:27.893
Actually, you know what?
I-I've been thinking.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.394
Stop that.

12:29.462 --> 12:31.163
If our mission
is to betray Morgan,

12:31.230 --> 12:32.831
I think we should have
a second mission:

12:32.899 --> 12:34.599
To convince Anna of what
she's missing without him.

12:34.667 --> 12:36.034
Only one mission here, moron.

12:36.102 --> 12:37.569
Oh, "moron," that's...

12:37.637 --> 12:40.038
You know, sticks and stones
may break my bones...

12:40.106 --> 12:41.873
Do you want me to test
that theory, Bartowski?

12:41.941 --> 12:43.041
Not particularly.
- No.

12:44.744 --> 12:46.878
Ha.

13:00.259 --> 13:03.495
So, uh, Anna, w-what's
the occasion for all this?

13:03.563 --> 13:04.830
It's a car preview

13:04.897 --> 13:06.832
for an auction Jason's
having tomorrow--

13:06.899 --> 13:08.533
sort of an open house for cars.

13:08.601 --> 13:10.235
Oh.

13:10.303 --> 13:12.738
Anna, these, these cars are
almost the price of a house.

13:12.805 --> 13:14.606
Your boyfriend must be
very successful.

13:14.674 --> 13:15.640
Although the,
the true measure

13:15.708 --> 13:17.542
of a man's success

13:17.610 --> 13:19.211
is not in dollars but rather

13:19.278 --> 13:21.313
his ability to love,

13:21.380 --> 13:22.981
and if that's true,
Morgan is stinking rich.

13:24.350 --> 13:26.218
I mean, wouldn't
you agree, Sarah?

13:26.285 --> 13:28.286
I do miss you guys together.

13:28.354 --> 13:30.222
You do?
- I'm sure

13:30.289 --> 13:32.724
Jason's a great guy,
but I'll always think

13:32.792 --> 13:34.493
of you and Morgan
as the perfect couple.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.094
And she'd say
it all the time,

13:36.162 --> 13:38.130
"cute couple alert: Here
comes Morgan and Anna."

13:39.499 --> 13:40.365
Cut the infomercial
on the bearded loser.

13:40.433 --> 13:42.033
Wang just walked in.

13:44.704 --> 13:45.704
Huh.

13:45.772 --> 13:47.506
That is so strange.

13:47.573 --> 13:49.407
What-what's strange? That
I was touching my ear?

13:49.475 --> 13:50.609
That's-- no,
that's eczema,

13:50.676 --> 13:52.844
Which is totally normal,
not strange.

13:52.912 --> 13:53.779
People have it.
No,

13:53.846 --> 13:55.080
Strange Sarah even thought

13:55.148 --> 13:56.681
about Morgan and I
as a couple.

13:56.749 --> 13:57.949
To be honest,

13:58.017 --> 14:00.685
I didn't think you ever
really noticed me much.

14:00.753 --> 14:02.020
That's not true, Anna.

14:02.088 --> 14:03.822
I have always thought of you
as a friend.

14:03.890 --> 14:06.258
Honey,

14:06.325 --> 14:08.894
Can you come here?

14:10.062 --> 14:13.131
Jason, this is Sarah and Chuck.

14:13.199 --> 14:14.466
They're my friends.

14:14.534 --> 14:16.268
Well, any friend of Anna's...
- Hi.

14:16.335 --> 14:17.903
Even though this is our,
our first time meeting,

14:17.970 --> 14:19.304
I feel as though I know

14:19.372 --> 14:21.373
every teeny, tiny,
little thing about you.

14:21.440 --> 14:22.974
All good, I hope.

14:24.177 --> 14:26.278
Hello, douche bag.

14:27.480 --> 14:30.215
Okay, okay.

14:30.283 --> 14:31.616
What do we got here?

14:32.819 --> 14:35.353
No, it can't be.

14:37.790 --> 14:40.592
Judas.

14:48.218 --> 14:49.418
Nerd herd desk.

14:49.486 --> 14:51.019
Download me
on your computer emergency.

14:51.087 --> 14:51.920
Hi, hi, uh,

14:51.988 --> 14:53.088
this is Ellie Bartowski.

14:53.156 --> 14:54.723
Is my brother around?
Devon and I were

14:54.791 --> 14:56.859
in the middle of our guest
list and the computer...

14:56.926 --> 14:58.093
froze.

14:58.161 --> 15:00.062
Uh, hey, Ellie, uh,

15:00.130 --> 15:02.030
I think Chuck is out
on an install right now.

15:02.098 --> 15:03.499
I'll leave him a message.

15:03.566 --> 15:04.833
Okay.

15:04.901 --> 15:07.669
Uh, we'll be right over
to fix it.

15:07.737 --> 15:10.939
Oh, thank you,
thank you, that's great.

15:11.007 --> 15:13.542
Wow, it finally pays to have
a brother in mediocre places.

15:13.610 --> 15:15.677
Um, Jefferson?

15:15.745 --> 15:18.180
Dude, you almost blew
our big chance.

15:18.248 --> 15:21.383
We're going over there
to audition.

15:21.451 --> 15:22.918
What do you mean?

15:22.986 --> 15:24.153
Like, right now?

15:24.220 --> 15:25.554
Come on, man.

15:25.622 --> 15:29.558
If you had one shot,
one opportunity

15:29.626 --> 15:32.261
to seize everything
you ever wanted,

15:32.328 --> 15:34.062
one moment,

15:34.130 --> 15:37.833
would you capture it
or just let it slip?

15:40.036 --> 15:42.704
Jeffster! Lives, man.

15:42.772 --> 15:44.907
Yes.

15:50.413 --> 15:53.048
Great, fantastic.

16:13.102 --> 16:15.170
I just flashed.

16:15.238 --> 16:16.772
Her name is Smooth Lau,
and they're

16:16.839 --> 16:18.207
all Triad.
- Okay,

16:18.274 --> 16:20.475
let's follow them.

16:20.543 --> 16:21.610
Hey, um,

16:21.678 --> 16:23.178
can I talk to you?

16:23.246 --> 16:25.714
I could really use a friend
right now.

16:25.782 --> 16:27.182
Oh, sure.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.151
I'll catch up in a second,
sweetie.

16:29.219 --> 16:30.319
Okay.

16:30.386 --> 16:32.354
Wait for me.

16:32.422 --> 16:33.288
Yeah.

16:33.356 --> 16:34.389
Thanks, chuckles.

16:34.457 --> 16:35.791
I'm all ears.

16:35.858 --> 16:38.594
Rebooted it
and ran a disk utility.

16:38.661 --> 16:40.295
It's as good
as a non-new computer can be.

16:40.363 --> 16:41.897
Oh, thank God.

16:41.965 --> 16:43.265
The woman can replace
an aortic valve,

16:43.333 --> 16:44.299
but a frozen computer screen

16:44.367 --> 16:46.134
makes her panic.

16:47.503 --> 16:49.738
Uh, excuse me.

16:49.806 --> 16:51.306
Why are you touching

16:51.374 --> 16:52.307
my things?

16:52.375 --> 16:55.377
I'm setting up to rock you hard.

16:55.445 --> 16:57.946
Uh, rock <i>who</i> hard?

16:58.014 --> 16:59.514
Our audition.

16:59.582 --> 17:00.882
Jeffster! Is going to play

17:00.950 --> 17:03.785
the biggest gig of your life:

17:03.853 --> 17:05.587
your wedding day.

17:05.655 --> 17:08.323
Is he drunk?

17:08.391 --> 17:09.491
You didn't really set them up

17:09.559 --> 17:10.759
to audition, did you?

17:10.827 --> 17:11.859
Of course not.

17:11.928 --> 17:12.961
Chuck must have.

17:13.029 --> 17:14.029
Sibilance.

17:14.097 --> 17:15.364
Check.

17:15.431 --> 17:17.432
Wait a minute, did you outsource
your to-do list?

17:17.500 --> 17:18.467
No...

17:18.534 --> 17:20.836
I know how much
Chuck loves music.

17:20.903 --> 17:22.104
Thought it'd be fun for him.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.771
Oh, you did?
# mah, may, moe, moo #

17:23.839 --> 17:24.839
# mah, may, moo #

17:24.906 --> 17:25.874
# mah, mee #

17:25.942 --> 17:27.175
# mah... #

17:27.242 --> 17:30.712
Uh, excuse me, guys, we,
we just have a lot to do.

17:30.780 --> 17:32.514
Oh. Sure, cool, cool,
sure, we're all set.

17:32.582 --> 17:34.349
L-let's, let's do this.

17:34.417 --> 17:35.884
Now or never.

17:35.952 --> 17:37.219
Hang on.
# mah, may, mee, moe #

17:37.287 --> 17:39.755
# moo... moo... #

17:39.822 --> 17:42.658
This is what we've always
wanted for Jeffster!

17:42.725 --> 17:44.192
We start at a small venue

17:44.260 --> 17:45.560
like this.

17:45.628 --> 17:47.863
Pretty soon, we're
playing the big time.

17:52.168 --> 17:54.670
Yeah, sure, we're going
to blow their minds,

17:54.737 --> 17:57.673
but where does all this lead?

17:57.740 --> 17:59.941
Stadiums, groupies, drugs,

18:00.009 --> 18:01.777
creative differences,
and then what?

18:01.844 --> 18:02.844
Jeffster! Breaks up?

18:02.912 --> 18:04.513
That's you and me, Jeff.

18:04.580 --> 18:06.181
And then what's my fate?
Some chambermaid finds me

18:06.249 --> 18:07.783
in a hotel room, having
accidentally asphyxiated

18:07.850 --> 18:08.817
while making love to myself?

18:08.885 --> 18:09.851
It's just not worth it!

18:15.658 --> 18:18.360
He's such a tortured artist.

18:18.428 --> 18:20.462
Mm-hmm.

18:20.530 --> 18:22.230
Look, I'm having a
very important party

18:22.298 --> 18:24.700
out there, and we've never
done it this way before.

18:24.767 --> 18:26.301
Yeah, yeah, just give me the keys.

18:26.369 --> 18:29.371
I think I've earned the right
to know what's going on.

18:29.439 --> 18:32.607
What's in the container?

18:32.675 --> 18:35.210
You mind your business,
I'll mind mine.

18:35.278 --> 18:36.945
You're getting paid
either way.

18:40.950 --> 18:44.086
Come on, flash.

18:44.153 --> 18:46.088
Flash, damn it.

18:48.991 --> 18:50.192
I can help.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.760
He's probably...

18:51.828 --> 18:54.262
Okay.

18:58.501 --> 19:00.435
Look, this is
way too risky.

19:00.503 --> 19:01.436
I'm out after this shipment.

19:01.504 --> 19:03.271
Well, if all goes well,

19:03.339 --> 19:04.373
we won't need another.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.841
And what are you worried about?

19:05.908 --> 19:07.776
Customs didn't suspect a thing
with that Rolls Royce

19:07.844 --> 19:09.344
in the crate.

19:10.546 --> 19:13.982
Where the hell is he?

19:14.050 --> 19:15.517
The door is jammed.

19:15.585 --> 19:17.619
I'll go get a crowbar.

19:27.196 --> 19:28.730
Hey, wait.

19:28.798 --> 19:30.165
Be quiet,
I thought I heard something.

19:30.233 --> 19:32.701
Damn it, Bartowski.

19:43.146 --> 19:43.979
Did you hear that?

19:55.124 --> 19:58.059
I like Jason and,
you know, on paper,

19:58.127 --> 20:00.362
he's everything Morgan's not,
so that's good.

20:00.430 --> 20:01.630
No, no, that's bad.

20:01.697 --> 20:03.064
Why?

20:03.132 --> 20:05.333
Because Morgan's the guy
you keep comparing him to.

20:06.502 --> 20:08.970
Sarah, you're totally right.

20:09.038 --> 20:10.105
Oh, my God.

20:10.173 --> 20:13.341
Do you think
that means I still love him?

20:13.409 --> 20:16.077
Attention, security, we found
an intruder on the premises.

20:16.145 --> 20:17.379
Chuck.

20:25.221 --> 20:28.323
Repeat, we found an intruder
on the premises.

20:28.391 --> 20:29.825
Oh, no.

20:31.928 --> 20:34.262
Casey.

20:36.966 --> 20:38.600
Hey, wait.

20:38.668 --> 20:40.168
If Chuck hasn't been
captured, then...

20:40.236 --> 20:42.304
who is the spy
being held by Triad?

20:42.371 --> 20:43.238
Ow!

20:43.306 --> 20:44.439
W-w-w-w-wait, wait, wait.

20:44.507 --> 20:45.974
Let me explain!

20:46.042 --> 20:47.342
Hey, you're going to
damage my Schwinn.

20:47.410 --> 20:48.743
Oh, my God, that's Morgan.
They've got Morgan!

20:48.811 --> 20:49.778
Hey, whoa!

20:49.846 --> 20:51.813
What?
We've got to help him.

20:51.881 --> 20:53.949
No, Chuck, we cannot just
start pulling out weapons.

20:54.016 --> 20:55.317
We're going to blow our cover.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.885
Okay, fine,
then what's the next option?

20:56.953 --> 20:58.587
You think it's easy
for me to do nothing?

20:58.654 --> 21:00.589
It goes against everything I
believe in to leave a man behind.

21:00.656 --> 21:02.524
Then don't do nothing.
Do something.

21:02.592 --> 21:04.025
We can't just stand here
while my best friend gets

21:04.093 --> 21:05.060
tortured or killed.

21:07.163 --> 21:10.532
Fine, if you're not going
to save him...

21:10.600 --> 21:11.867
then I will.
- Hey.

21:11.934 --> 21:13.201
Wai-wait.

21:13.269 --> 21:14.402
Who are you?

21:14.470 --> 21:15.871
Nobody.

21:15.938 --> 21:17.239
I'm... I'm...

21:19.976 --> 21:22.110
My name is, uh,
Marlamin Stoneheart.

21:22.178 --> 21:23.678
I'm a 60th-level
gnome warrior.

21:23.746 --> 21:24.846
The truth.

21:24.914 --> 21:27.949
Okay, okay, wow.

21:28.017 --> 21:29.684
59th level, you know, but
I'm-I'm, like, this close.

21:29.752 --> 21:30.886
I found him spying on us.

21:30.953 --> 21:32.387
You've got one second
to tell me why.

21:32.455 --> 21:33.355
One!

21:33.422 --> 21:34.856
W-w-w-w-wait!

21:34.924 --> 21:37.092
Wait, he's not a spy!
And who the hell are you?

21:37.159 --> 21:39.294
Wait, what's going on?
- Morgan?

21:39.362 --> 21:40.762
This is your ex from buy more?

21:40.830 --> 21:42.430
What are you doing here?

21:42.498 --> 21:44.966
Tell me before I break
your neck.

21:45.034 --> 21:47.302
No, no, no, no, don't...
You don't want to do that,

21:47.370 --> 21:49.037
Because I know why he's here.

21:49.105 --> 21:51.406
He's here...

21:51.474 --> 21:52.674
Chuck, man...

21:54.677 --> 21:56.945
He's here because
he's stalking you.

21:57.013 --> 21:57.846
What?

21:59.482 --> 22:00.415
That's right, that's right.

22:00.483 --> 22:01.416
He's not a spy, okay?

22:01.484 --> 22:02.551
He's a stalker,

22:02.618 --> 22:04.786
which is a thin, but-but very,

22:04.854 --> 22:06.888
very key difference,

22:06.956 --> 22:08.757
in my opinion.

22:08.824 --> 22:10.759
I see why Anna dumped you.

22:10.826 --> 22:13.161
This guy is a
profoundly disturbed

22:13.229 --> 22:14.362
individual, okay?

22:14.430 --> 22:16.097
He just can't...
He can't let go of her.

22:16.165 --> 22:17.899
He's an obsessed

22:17.967 --> 22:20.168
but totally unthreatening...

22:22.104 --> 22:23.705
...sicko.

22:26.342 --> 22:27.542
Grow up, Morgan Grimes.

22:28.844 --> 22:30.111
Sicko freak.

22:30.179 --> 22:31.513
Let him go.

22:35.084 --> 22:37.152
Let's go.

22:41.657 --> 22:44.125
Well, you just saved
your best friend's life.

22:44.193 --> 22:46.261
At the expense of his dignity.

22:46.329 --> 22:48.430
Well, at least he's still breathing.

22:48.497 --> 22:49.831
Come on.

22:59.275 --> 23:01.176
Look what I just found, boss.

23:04.947 --> 23:06.114
Guess that little freak

23:06.182 --> 23:08.617
wasn't just a stalker after all.

23:08.684 --> 23:09.517
Kill him.

23:13.776 --> 23:14.943
Hey.

23:15.011 --> 23:16.811
Hey, buddy, you...
You need some help?

23:16.879 --> 23:18.046
Nope.

23:18.114 --> 23:20.415
I got to learn to do things

23:20.483 --> 23:22.217
on my own from now on.

23:29.025 --> 23:31.493
Look, Morgan,
I know that I hurt

23:31.560 --> 23:33.628
your feelings, but I was only
trying to protect you.

23:33.696 --> 23:35.463
We've been friends for
a long time, right?

23:35.531 --> 23:36.865
As long as I can remember,
buddy.

23:36.932 --> 23:38.733
Enjoy the memories.

23:38.801 --> 23:39.701
What?

23:39.769 --> 23:40.969
Buddy.

23:41.037 --> 23:42.737
You got any idea what
Ellie and awesome

23:42.805 --> 23:43.672
thought about Jeffster!?

23:45.107 --> 23:46.541
I mean, we... we didn't

23:46.609 --> 23:49.511
fully play out, but if you could
put in a good word.

23:49.578 --> 23:50.779
Jeff, I don't understand
anything

23:50.846 --> 23:52.180
That just came out
of your mouth.

23:52.248 --> 23:53.315
The truth is,
I don't care.

23:53.382 --> 23:54.683
I know that you think
my concerns

23:54.750 --> 23:56.718
are no bigger
than the weekend weather

23:56.786 --> 23:58.286
or whatever's new
in the snack machine,

23:58.354 --> 24:00.422
but I have the weight
of the damn world

24:00.489 --> 24:02.057
on my shoulders,
so if you don't mind,

24:02.124 --> 24:04.125
figure out your own crap.

24:06.996 --> 24:07.996
Good, you're here.

24:08.064 --> 24:09.230
I need you to cross-check

24:09.298 --> 24:11.166
these Customs docs
with the bill of lading

24:11.233 --> 24:13.735
that you saw
on the container yesterday.

24:13.803 --> 24:15.870
How could you just stand there
and make me choose

24:15.938 --> 24:17.439
between Morgan's life
and his friendship?

24:17.506 --> 24:20.408
That wasn't going to happen
because Anna vouched for him.

24:20.476 --> 24:21.943
You don't get who he is to me.

24:22.011 --> 24:23.044
No, I get it.

24:23.112 --> 24:24.412
He's your best friend.

24:25.581 --> 24:26.981
You know, you say that,

24:27.049 --> 24:29.250
but I don't think you
have a clue what it means.

24:29.318 --> 24:31.519
Look, Sarah...

24:31.587 --> 24:33.988
I don't have parents.

24:34.056 --> 24:35.323
I mean, not really.

24:35.391 --> 24:36.391
And I don't talk

24:36.459 --> 24:37.859
about it because
that's just the way

24:37.927 --> 24:39.194
that things are now.

24:39.261 --> 24:41.796
But it wasn't always this way.

24:41.864 --> 24:45.700
Morgan was there the first day
that my mom took off.

24:45.768 --> 24:48.203
He didn't say much
because, honestly,

24:48.270 --> 24:50.171
what is a fifth grader
supposed to say?

24:50.239 --> 24:52.173
But we sat there and split
a cherry cheesecake

24:52.241 --> 24:54.876
and played Legend of Zelda
all night long.

24:54.944 --> 24:57.912
And my dad...
Well, that's a whole...

24:57.980 --> 25:02.117
other story, but Morgan
was there for that, too.

25:02.184 --> 25:04.552
Morgan is more
than just my best friend.

25:04.620 --> 25:07.255
He's my family.

25:07.323 --> 25:09.691
Before you got here

25:09.759 --> 25:14.896
and long after you've gone,
Morgan is my family.

25:18.834 --> 25:20.468
Last night, we failed to learn

25:20.536 --> 25:21.870
the contents of the
Triad's container,

25:21.937 --> 25:23.438
and now we don't know

25:23.506 --> 25:25.874
what kind of drugs or weapons
are floating around in the city.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.176
And while I appreciate
your friendship with Morgan,

25:28.244 --> 25:30.111
losing sight of that container

25:30.179 --> 25:32.347
endangers many people's
best friends.

25:32.415 --> 25:34.783
Not just yours, Chuck.

25:46.462 --> 25:47.462
Not a good time, bro.

25:50.366 --> 25:52.567
Dude, you're supposed to
stop a door with your foot.

25:52.635 --> 25:53.835
Have you ever had a dream

25:53.903 --> 25:55.937
that's never come true?

25:57.373 --> 25:58.640
Hmm.

25:58.707 --> 25:59.741
No.

25:59.809 --> 26:01.709
Okay.

26:01.777 --> 26:03.511
Have you ever had a best friend

26:03.579 --> 26:05.413
with a dream
that's never come true?

26:05.481 --> 26:07.982
Lester was scared
to sing yesterday,

26:08.050 --> 26:10.218
but he has a voice

26:10.286 --> 26:11.820
that makes angels cry.

26:11.887 --> 26:15.590
Please, give Jeffster
another chance.

26:18.427 --> 26:20.195
Jeff, you're a weird dude,

26:20.262 --> 26:21.429
but I guess even
a weird dude

26:21.497 --> 26:23.631
like you can have a friend.

26:23.699 --> 26:25.700
I don't know how I'm
gonna convince Ellie,

26:25.768 --> 26:27.135
but you got yourself
another audition.

26:27.203 --> 26:28.903
You want me to talk to her?

26:30.439 --> 26:32.674
We have a rapport.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.481
Hey, Morgan,
will you please, please

26:39.548 --> 26:40.949
just talk to me
for one second?

26:41.016 --> 26:43.451
I have nothing left
to say to you, dude.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.320
One question, though,

26:45.387 --> 26:47.222
before, uh, I never
speak to you again.

26:47.289 --> 26:49.958
How did you betraying me
turn into you saving me?

26:51.126 --> 26:52.527
I'm sorry for betraying you.

26:52.595 --> 26:54.662
No, dude, you don't
get to say sorry.

26:54.730 --> 26:55.830
You're right,
sorry isn't good enough.

26:55.898 --> 26:56.998
It's a cheap band-aid...

26:57.066 --> 26:58.600
Stop it, dude,
you don't get it.

26:59.902 --> 27:01.636
This whole thing is my fault.

27:01.704 --> 27:02.670
Man, it's me.

27:02.738 --> 27:03.771
I made this mess.

27:03.839 --> 27:05.006
You warned me not to spy.

27:05.074 --> 27:06.307
I went and did it anyway.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.542
You know, I'm so sick
of you being right

27:07.610 --> 27:08.743
and then having to bail me out.

27:08.811 --> 27:10.578
You've bailed me out
plenty of times.

27:10.646 --> 27:13.681
I can't count on you
to fix things my whole life.

27:13.749 --> 27:15.216
Of course you can.
- Look,

27:15.284 --> 27:17.819
It's time for me to pay
for my own mistakes,

27:17.887 --> 27:20.154
fight my own battles.

27:24.894 --> 27:26.194
Um, buddy, I...

27:26.262 --> 27:27.996
I would maybe start
with a different battle.

27:36.605 --> 27:38.239
Look, just keep it down,
remain calm,

27:38.307 --> 27:40.208
and this will all be over soon.

27:40.276 --> 27:41.643
No, dude, you know
what this is?

27:41.710 --> 27:43.144
This is just you
saving me again, man.

27:43.212 --> 27:45.046
No, no, it's not.

27:45.114 --> 27:48.283
This is two best friends hiding
from a terrible beating.

27:48.350 --> 27:49.450
The time is now, okay?

27:49.518 --> 27:50.952
Time for me to stand
up for myself.

27:51.020 --> 27:52.720
I have to go out there to
those beefy, heartless thugs

27:52.788 --> 27:54.055
and take it like a grown man.

27:54.123 --> 27:56.190
A grown man who spies
on women, fine,

27:56.258 --> 27:57.325
but still...

27:57.393 --> 27:59.227
I'm done, Chuck, okay?

27:59.295 --> 28:00.695
I won't have you
saving me anymore.

28:02.398 --> 28:03.498
No, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

28:03.566 --> 28:05.199
Morgan, Morgan,
wait, wait.

28:05.267 --> 28:08.102
You can't... you can't just
go out there with your..

28:08.170 --> 28:10.138
with your breath stinking like garbage.
- Are you kidding me?

28:10.205 --> 28:12.640
Way to kick a man
when he's about to be beat down.

28:12.708 --> 28:14.108
I'm short and occasionally
have dandruff in my beard.

28:14.176 --> 28:15.643
Do you want to riff
on me for that, too?

28:15.711 --> 28:17.011
No, I... I wouldn't...

28:17.079 --> 28:18.413
You have dandruff in your beard?

28:18.480 --> 28:20.281
I would... No,
all I'm saying is that

28:20.349 --> 28:22.183
maybe you should freshen up
first, you know.

28:22.251 --> 28:23.851
Why... why poke an already
pissed off bear?

28:23.919 --> 28:25.687
Huh?

28:25.754 --> 28:26.921
Ah-ah.

28:26.989 --> 28:28.556
All right, just...

28:28.624 --> 28:29.757
That's strong--
what is that, pep...

28:29.825 --> 28:30.792
is that just peppermint?

28:33.362 --> 28:34.762
That's quick.

28:45.908 --> 28:47.742
Hey.

28:47.810 --> 28:50.745
You seen that stalker from
the party the other night?

28:50.813 --> 28:53.348
Yeah, yeah, I think
he actually went out the back.

28:53.415 --> 28:54.916
Uh...

28:54.984 --> 28:56.484
Talking about getting a slice
or something

28:56.552 --> 28:58.686
like that, so...

28:59.888 --> 29:00.822
Take it easy.

29:06.228 --> 29:07.662
Hey, what is it?

29:07.730 --> 29:08.730
Chuck's in trouble.
Let's go.

29:10.132 --> 29:11.399
So much for my day off.

29:13.869 --> 29:15.870
Chuck, I want you
to see something.

29:15.938 --> 29:17.538
No time-- I'm actually
right in the middle

29:17.606 --> 29:19.507
of moving this very cumbersome
and time-sensitive appliance,

29:19.575 --> 29:20.942
so I... Anna, Anna, Anna.
- Come on.

29:21.010 --> 29:21.943
It'll just take a second.

29:22.011 --> 29:24.178
Look, my boyfriend's on TV.

29:24.246 --> 29:26.447
Antonio Ruiz reporting
from downtown Los Angeles

29:26.515 --> 29:29.183
Where I'm standing
with entrepreneur, Jason Wang.

29:29.251 --> 29:31.085
On the auction block today,
a collection

29:31.153 --> 29:32.587
of very fine automobiles...

29:38.160 --> 29:41.062
Celebrities and dignitaries
are everywhere

29:41.130 --> 29:42.730
with one thing in common.

29:47.169 --> 29:48.503
...a passion for cars.

29:48.570 --> 29:50.271
Oh, my God, the auction.

29:50.339 --> 29:51.472
Don't rub it in.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.141
I have to work.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.043
Chuck, what is it?

29:55.110 --> 29:57.211
I just flashed-- we have
to get to the auction.

29:57.279 --> 29:59.113
Triads are gonna kill
the Chinese Ambassador.

29:59.181 --> 30:01.549
Why would he walk
into a known Triad den?

30:01.617 --> 30:03.051
Wang's got
a legitimate business.

30:03.118 --> 30:04.585
The Ambassador doesn't know
Wang's Triad.

30:04.653 --> 30:06.754
Which is exactly why it's not
a very safe place for him.

30:06.822 --> 30:07.822
Look, we just got
to get Morgan...

30:13.395 --> 30:14.629
Wait.

30:18.867 --> 30:20.101
Morgan!

30:39.277 --> 30:40.911
Stay in the car, Chuck.

30:40.979 --> 30:43.280
What... How can I stay
in the car when I have

30:43.348 --> 30:45.315
to go save Morgan?
- Please, Chuck, just follow orders.

30:45.383 --> 30:47.284
Bartowski, you're like the
poster child for friendly fire.

31:18.950 --> 31:20.117
Oh, my God.

31:20.184 --> 31:21.852
Oh, my God, it's a bomb.

31:21.920 --> 31:22.953
Ambassador...

31:23.021 --> 31:24.855
congratulations
on your new rolls.

31:24.923 --> 31:26.089
Oh, thank you.

31:26.157 --> 31:27.558
It's always been my
dream to own one.

31:29.360 --> 31:31.461
You take care
of last night's problem?

31:33.965 --> 31:34.898
He dead?

31:34.966 --> 31:35.799
Not yet.

31:37.769 --> 31:38.802
What do you want us
to do with him?

31:41.439 --> 31:42.940
I got a great idea.

31:44.309 --> 31:46.510
He can hitch a ride
with the Ambassador.

31:48.112 --> 31:49.346
Oh, God.

31:49.414 --> 31:51.148
Kill two birds with one bomb.

31:55.820 --> 31:57.254
Hey, listen, listen.

31:57.322 --> 31:59.556
Triads implanted a bomb
in the Rolls Royce,

31:59.624 --> 32:00.891
and they put Morgan
in the trunk.

32:00.959 --> 32:02.025
We've got to stop it.

32:02.093 --> 32:03.627
Chuck, stay right
where you are.

32:03.695 --> 32:05.495
I'll get the car,
you get Chuck.

32:20.745 --> 32:22.713
Casey, the container is empty,

32:22.780 --> 32:24.514
and the car has already been
dispatched.

32:24.582 --> 32:26.416
Casey, do you copy?

32:26.484 --> 32:28.952
Casey, do you copy?!

32:36.361 --> 32:38.195
Pretty girl like you
is a cop-- whew.

32:39.931 --> 32:41.598
Shame I gotta mess up that face.

32:53.878 --> 32:54.945
Wait, wait, wait!
Stop! Stop!

32:55.013 --> 32:56.747
Stop, there's a
bomb in your car!

32:56.814 --> 32:58.682
It's a Triad trap, move!

32:58.750 --> 32:59.783
No! No...

33:04.088 --> 33:05.956
Learn to follow an order,
Bartowski!

33:33.518 --> 33:35.419
Hey... Aah!

33:35.486 --> 33:36.787
Let me in!
- I can't!

33:36.854 --> 33:38.822
If I do that, you're not going
to let me save Morgan.

33:38.890 --> 33:40.490
Proving you're
not a complete idiot.

33:40.558 --> 33:41.892
Let me in!
- Nope! No!

33:58.543 --> 34:00.844
He's my best friend, Casey,
all right?!

34:00.912 --> 34:02.512
It's like you said,
leave no man behind!

34:02.580 --> 34:04.014
Okay, tell you what.

34:04.082 --> 34:06.550
If you let me in, I promise to
help you save the bearded loser.

34:06.617 --> 34:08.150
You promise?
- I promise.

34:08.219 --> 34:11.321
Semper Fi?
- Semper Fidelis.

34:26.804 --> 34:29.272
Oh! What are you doing?

34:29.340 --> 34:31.507
What are you doing?!

34:31.576 --> 34:32.876
You promised that you'd
help me save Morgan.

34:32.944 --> 34:34.610
I didn't promise
I'd let you drive.

34:38.916 --> 34:40.317
There's a remote control
for this thing?

34:40.384 --> 34:41.918
This is crazy.

35:11.149 --> 35:13.850
The Rolls, the Rolls,
don't... oh! Oh!

35:22.393 --> 35:25.996
Whoa, whoa! Major John Casey,
National Security Agency.

35:26.063 --> 35:27.164
This is my badge?

35:27.231 --> 35:29.866
Safety that weapon.
It's cool, relax.

35:29.934 --> 35:32.002
We're here to stop an attempt
on the Ambassador's life.

35:32.069 --> 35:33.203
Be cool.

35:33.271 --> 35:34.971
We're just trying to help.

35:36.207 --> 35:37.841
Bomb!

35:39.076 --> 35:40.577
On the ground!
Don't move!

35:40.645 --> 35:41.912
You're risking your life!

35:41.979 --> 35:43.680
No, I'm saving Morgan's!

35:43.748 --> 35:45.749
Don't be an idiot.

35:45.817 --> 35:47.384
Head down!
Head down!

35:47.451 --> 35:49.419
Easy.

35:53.758 --> 35:55.892
Hey, CIA. Let him go.

35:55.960 --> 35:57.160
Where's Chuck?

35:57.228 --> 35:59.696
Heroic imbecile took
off with the bomb.

36:01.165 --> 36:03.166
Oh, my God, Chuck.

36:23.654 --> 36:24.754
That was pretty sweet, huh?

36:26.691 --> 36:27.624
What?

36:29.794 --> 36:31.761
Did you think that I was...?

36:31.829 --> 36:35.031
No, I was just using the...

36:35.099 --> 36:36.733
Give me that.

36:38.569 --> 36:40.737
Sorry.

36:40.805 --> 36:42.405
Um...

36:42.473 --> 36:44.007
Last-last favor.

36:44.075 --> 36:46.176
Would you mind helping me get
something out of the trunk?

37:02.596 --> 37:06.532
Oh...
- Oh, yeah, hey.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.734
Hey...
are you okay?

37:08.802 --> 37:10.703
You really had me worried.

37:10.771 --> 37:12.905
Oh, man...
I'm so embarrassed.

37:12.973 --> 37:16.142
I can't even get my ass
kicked with any dignity.

37:16.209 --> 37:18.144
Dude, I can't believe
I fainted.

37:18.211 --> 37:20.212
Yeah...

37:20.280 --> 37:22.415
Yeah, yeah...

37:22.482 --> 37:23.816
You fainted.

37:23.884 --> 37:25.718
I'm such a coward.

37:25.786 --> 37:27.620
I don't know, I guess...

37:27.688 --> 37:29.388
Just the fear of a fight,

37:29.456 --> 37:30.823
must've been too much for me.

37:30.891 --> 37:33.192
And I'm sorry, Chuck.

37:33.260 --> 37:35.528
I'm sorry that
you had to save me...

37:35.595 --> 37:36.962
Again.

37:37.030 --> 37:38.998
Come on. Morgan...

37:39.066 --> 37:41.333
Don't you know
who you are to me?

37:41.401 --> 37:42.668
Don't you know
what you mean to me?

37:42.736 --> 37:44.804
All that you've done?

37:44.871 --> 37:47.173
Thank you.

37:47.240 --> 37:49.375
You're welcome.

37:49.443 --> 37:51.610
You think you could butch it up
just a bit, though, bro.

37:51.678 --> 37:52.712
Just like...

37:54.448 --> 37:56.749
Smooth Lau and her band
of cohorts were apprehended

37:56.817 --> 37:58.951
at the scene, and Jason Wang has
just been taken into custody.

37:59.019 --> 38:01.520
They will all be spending
a lot of time in prison

38:01.588 --> 38:04.590
thanks to all of you.
- Thank you, General.

38:04.658 --> 38:06.926
Furthermore, this incident
has left Ambassador Mei Sheng

38:06.993 --> 38:09.328
with a renewed vigor
to crack down on Triad crime

38:09.396 --> 38:11.097
both here and overseas.

38:11.164 --> 38:13.599
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I am late for my evening plans.

38:13.667 --> 38:17.269
Uh, General, um,
if you don't mind me asking...

38:17.337 --> 38:20.940
what exactly is your version
of evening plans?

38:21.007 --> 38:22.508
Bartowski!

38:22.576 --> 38:24.577
It's not top secret, Major.

38:24.644 --> 38:26.879
I'm meeting Condoleeza
for cosmos.

38:26.947 --> 38:29.582
Even I have friends.

38:33.487 --> 38:36.021
Sorry about delegating the music
stuff to Chuck.

38:36.089 --> 38:37.923
But an apology is just words

38:37.991 --> 38:39.959
if it's not followed up
by actions.

38:40.026 --> 38:42.228
So I got the flowers,
I bought the cake,

38:42.295 --> 38:45.231
and I took care of your half
of the to-do list.

38:45.298 --> 38:47.032
That's very sweet, Devon.

38:47.100 --> 38:49.034
I'm also back in charge
of finding the band,

38:49.102 --> 38:50.569
which is why we're here.

38:50.637 --> 38:51.804
What?

38:56.476 --> 38:59.044
Partnership is trust, babe.

38:59.112 --> 39:01.013
Come on.

39:03.083 --> 39:05.117
Partnership is trust.

39:05.185 --> 39:06.552
I can't do this, man.

39:06.620 --> 39:08.754
You can, I <i>know</i> you can.

39:08.822 --> 39:10.756
No...
you see before,

39:10.824 --> 39:12.258
Jeff, I wasn't really scared

39:12.325 --> 39:13.726
that the band was going
to break up.

39:13.794 --> 39:15.194
The truth is,
I was just sc...

39:15.262 --> 39:17.730
Shh, shh, shh.

39:17.798 --> 39:19.498
You ever had a dream
that's never come true?

39:19.566 --> 39:22.935
I'm asking you to sing,

39:23.003 --> 39:25.638
not for yourself...

39:25.705 --> 39:27.773
do it for me.

39:51.998 --> 39:55.901
# I hear the drums echoing
tonight #

39:55.969 --> 40:03.175
# but she hears only whispers
of some quiet conversation #

40:03.243 --> 40:05.911
Honey, you're not seriously
considering this lame band

40:05.979 --> 40:07.880
for our wedding day?

40:07.948 --> 40:12.518
# kilimanjaro rises like olympus
above the serengeti #

40:12.586 --> 40:16.488
No. But let a man have
his dream.

40:16.556 --> 40:18.858
Even if it is for five minutes.

40:18.925 --> 40:22.294
# hurry, boy,
it's waiting there for you #

40:24.564 --> 40:29.068
# gonna take a lot to drag me
away from you #

40:29.135 --> 40:34.340
# there's nothing that a hundred
men or more could ever do #

40:34.407 --> 40:38.711
# I bless the rains
down in Africa #

40:38.778 --> 40:46.518
# gonna take some time to do
the things we never had... #

40:51.258 --> 40:54.460
I wanted to apologize.

40:54.527 --> 40:56.495
I could've been
more sensitive before

40:56.563 --> 40:59.231
about your friendship
with Morgan.

40:59.299 --> 41:01.800
It's just,
it's difficult,

41:01.868 --> 41:04.270
I don't really have anyone
in my life like that, who...

41:04.337 --> 41:06.405
who cares about me.

41:06.473 --> 41:08.407
# gonna take a lot to drag me #

41:08.475 --> 41:10.943
Yeah, you do.
# away from you #

41:11.011 --> 41:15.981
# there's nothing that a hundred
men or more could ever do #

41:16.049 --> 41:20.085
# I bless the rains
down in Africa... #

41:20.153 --> 41:23.122
Anna...

41:23.189 --> 41:26.058
Listen, I-I should've said this
to you a long time ago.

41:26.126 --> 41:27.126
All right?

41:27.193 --> 41:30.996
Um, but, Anna Wu...

41:31.064 --> 41:32.531
I lo...

41:32.599 --> 41:37.403
I like you...
very, very much.

41:37.470 --> 41:42.541
# it's gonna take a lot
to drag me away from you #

41:42.609 --> 41:46.745
# there's nothing that a hundred
men or more could ever do #

41:46.813 --> 41:48.113
# I bless the rains

41:48.181 --> 41:50.683
Hey, guys.

41:50.750 --> 41:52.084
Look at us, man--

41:52.152 --> 41:54.053
We both got girlfriends.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.254
# I bless the rains
down in Africa #

41:55.322 --> 41:57.489
It's as good as it gets, man.

41:57.557 --> 41:58.791
<i># I bless the rain #</i>
