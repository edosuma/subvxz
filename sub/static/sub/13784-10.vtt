01:35.647 --> 01:37.922
Horse run trash
like that over by accident... 

01:38.007 --> 01:39.326
there ain't a white man on earth...

01:39.407 --> 01:42.080
gonna stand up against roping us up,
now is there?

01:42.167 --> 01:45.921
- John Brown would have.
- Come the fuck from over there, now.

01:47.567 --> 01:49.717
- Sheriff got a kid?
- And a wife.

01:49.807 --> 01:52.367
I sold him the plot
they built their house on.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.556
Jesus.

01:57.967 --> 01:59.116
Mrs Bullock!

02:22.287 --> 02:26.166
Put that tub of guts on the sled.
Take him to Joanie Stubbs!

02:31.407 --> 02:34.001
Every day since I've been in this camp...

02:34.087 --> 02:37.079
white folks shot
and stabbing on each other...

02:37.167 --> 02:39.806
still walking around to do their business.

02:39.887 --> 02:41.286
Maybe we could, too.

02:41.367 --> 02:44.598
Now, the onliest violence we meant...

02:44.807 --> 02:49.085
was to that stallion's prick
and then to turn an honest dollar.

02:56.607 --> 02:59.838
- Closed!
- Well, when you re-the-fuck-open...

02:59.927 --> 03:03.044
note Jane Cannary
extending stay in camp...

03:03.127 --> 03:04.924
asking you to turn out her horse.

03:05.007 --> 03:06.565
I'll note it down.

03:06.647 --> 03:09.241
- Short Nigger General in there?
- No!

03:10.607 --> 03:13.679
How about that stud
he brought into camp...

03:13.927 --> 03:16.521
with his cock hanging past his hocks?

03:17.047 --> 03:18.719
He ain't here.

03:19.007 --> 03:21.316
Congratulations being closed!

03:27.127 --> 03:29.880
There goes no one associating me
with that horse.

03:30.167 --> 03:34.524
I ain't begging them for mercy.
I hadn't ought have to do that.

03:41.407 --> 03:44.205
- Jesus Christ, Hostetler.
- It's my fucking choice.

03:44.287 --> 03:45.925
I ain't begged, and I ain't starting.

03:46.007 --> 03:50.080
Now, I'm gonna break your fucking arm
if you don't let go of that gun!

03:50.327 --> 03:52.841
Let's ride for six hours, Hostetler.

03:52.927 --> 03:55.919
Ain't no harm in that.
You won't have to beg me once.

03:56.007 --> 03:59.204
Hell, if you still want to do it,
I'll shoot you.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.037
If it come to that, I'd do it myself.

04:02.367 --> 04:06.246
He's definitely alive
'cause being lifted into the cabin...

04:06.327 --> 04:09.399
he give a moan out
and blood come from his mouth.

04:09.567 --> 04:13.242
- I told you the state of affairs.
- As of 15 minutes ago.

04:13.327 --> 04:16.285
Run back to the doc's cabin, Johnny!
See the boy again.

04:16.367 --> 04:17.356
Shut up.

04:17.447 --> 04:19.961
Maybe since you saw him,
he's changed...

04:20.047 --> 04:22.607
or the half his chest stove-in
may have healed.

04:22.687 --> 04:26.396
- Or his poor broken head.
- Shut up or I'll throw you out.

04:28.727 --> 04:32.163
Sign these documents
and leave unharmed.

04:33.047 --> 04:36.960
I can't trust that, Mr Swearengen,
being that it's not to your interests.

04:37.047 --> 04:38.446
That applies to you most...

04:38.527 --> 04:41.280
fucking sitting in that chair,
distracting my fucking thinking.

04:41.367 --> 04:44.200
If I have to come over there,
I'll cut your fucking throat for you...

04:44.287 --> 04:46.357
pen yet put to paper, or not.

04:54.647 --> 04:56.717
Half-smart fucking cunt.

04:59.007 --> 05:02.443
- Bring me Adams' fucking shadow.
- Fucking Hawkeye.

05:06.087 --> 05:08.157
- That poor boy.
- What do you want?

05:08.847 --> 05:12.442
The Sheriff's tragic preoccupation
is also inopportune.

05:13.407 --> 05:15.477
Commissioner Jarry
returns to Deadwood.

05:15.767 --> 05:17.166
How do you know?

05:18.207 --> 05:21.040
Believing that Blasanov
had borrowed my acacia gum...

05:21.127 --> 05:23.163
and as Blasanov
was no longer present...

05:23.247 --> 05:25.078
as I canvassed his desk
for the missing gum...

05:25.167 --> 05:27.203
I came across the information
by accident.

05:27.287 --> 05:29.005
- Telegram from Jarry.
- From Crook City.

05:29.087 --> 05:31.043
- To whose attention?
- To the separate attentions...

05:31.127 --> 05:33.277
of Messieurs Wolcott and Tolliver.

05:33.527 --> 05:34.880
Ironic, Al, isn't it...

05:34.967 --> 05:37.640
that having turned my newspaper
to partisan purpose...

05:37.727 --> 05:40.639
and in the name of the camp's welfare,
within the day...

05:40.727 --> 05:45.084
in the name of that good,
I progress to betraying without regret...

05:45.687 --> 05:47.757
the sanctity of private communications?

05:47.847 --> 05:48.836
Oh, well.

05:48.927 --> 05:52.920
We come to know the truth of our
actions only in the protractions of time.

05:53.007 --> 05:56.363
- When's the cocksucker arrive?
- Next coach, his message said.

05:56.927 --> 06:00.840
Unless he's being of aid to Bullock,
bring the Jew up here, too.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.918
Do you think the rumours we floated
in The Pioneer...

06:03.007 --> 06:04.406
are what prompt
the commissioner's return?

06:04.487 --> 06:05.476
Yes.

06:05.567 --> 06:08.718
And that wishing to pre-empt
Montana and Wyoming...

06:08.927 --> 06:11.487
he means to secure us
for Yankton and Dakota.

06:11.567 --> 06:13.956
And to sweeten the deal we'll strike...

06:14.047 --> 06:16.959
these interests we've fabricated
must be given face.

06:17.047 --> 06:20.676
And thus,
the uncharted journey continues.

06:20.807 --> 06:22.399
Merrick, please.

06:22.487 --> 06:24.762
As we'll be more often
in each other's company...

06:24.847 --> 06:28.317
when given to utterance of that type,
consider drinking.

06:32.767 --> 06:36.680
They congregate
outside Cochran's cabin.

06:37.967 --> 06:40.356
They've taken the child there.

06:43.087 --> 06:44.839
Well, I wish him well.

06:46.847 --> 06:48.041
Shit!

06:54.007 --> 06:55.406
Where's Hawkeye?

06:55.487 --> 06:58.160
I see, Dan, with the world off its axis...

06:58.247 --> 06:59.726
I'm no more to you than a room clerk.

06:59.807 --> 07:02.116
Hawkeye, E.B.,
is he here or fucking not?

07:02.207 --> 07:03.959
Not. For three days.

07:05.327 --> 07:08.000
Will you have a shine?
Leave your shoes while you eat.

07:08.087 --> 07:10.885
You see Hawkeye,
you grab him and bring him to me.

07:11.767 --> 07:14.565
If you'll leave your dirty clothes,
I'll see to them.

07:15.487 --> 07:19.400
- Did you fucking hear me? Hawkeye!
- Yes.

07:22.527 --> 07:25.087
A broken heart does not impair hearing!

07:27.487 --> 07:29.955
Did they get that fat bastard
to Joanie's?

07:30.047 --> 07:32.481
Did her ladyship take him in?

07:33.007 --> 07:35.362
Ain't towed him halfway yet, boss,
Leon and Con.

07:35.727 --> 07:37.877
We got to get a better sled.

07:37.967 --> 07:40.242
Less the sled's hold-up than Con's.

07:40.807 --> 07:42.763
Says he threw a rupture.

07:46.207 --> 07:48.641
You go back to that fucking circus act...

07:48.847 --> 07:50.917
and tell him to get Mose Manuel
to Joanie's...

07:51.007 --> 07:53.965
or a rupture won't be a tickle
to the pain I'll throw at him later.

07:59.727 --> 08:02.719
- Commissioner.
- Where will I find Sheriff Bullock?

08:03.167 --> 08:06.477
His boy had an accident.
He's with him at the doc's.

08:06.967 --> 08:09.640
- Where is the doc's?
- Oh, don't be a fool.

08:09.967 --> 08:13.004
Yankton's interests force imposition
on Bullock's privacy...

08:13.087 --> 08:14.600
as I think, Mr Wolcott,
do your employer's.

08:14.687 --> 08:17.997
You'll get a pistol-whipping
and not learn a fucking thing.

08:18.087 --> 08:21.841
These injuries mortal
to earn such commendable deference?

08:21.927 --> 08:23.679
Mortal's how I'd be betting.

08:23.767 --> 08:27.601
Of course that casts a different light.
Very sad for the Sheriff and his son.

08:28.847 --> 08:31.202
Can that paper man be made sensible?

08:31.287 --> 08:35.280
The article's a plant from Swearengen,
if that's what you'd want to ask Merrick.

08:35.366 --> 08:37.961
That's the beginning
of what I want to ask.

08:38.126 --> 08:39.606
Don't take much,
does it, Commissioner...

08:39.687 --> 08:41.405
to get your balls tucked up?

08:41.486 --> 08:44.479
They are very sensitive
to changes in weather.

08:44.887 --> 08:46.798
You feel one coming on?

08:51.807 --> 08:54.367
I am a sinner
who does not expect forgiveness.

08:55.247 --> 08:57.203
But I am not a government official.

09:19.567 --> 09:22.798
- Al wants to see you at the Gem.
- When I can.

09:22.887 --> 09:24.957
- No, he didn't say nothing about-
- I'm saying.

09:25.047 --> 09:28.642
- You're saying what?
- When I can.

09:29.767 --> 09:31.598
Are you getting fucking smart with me?

09:31.687 --> 09:32.836
'Cause I'll lift you up in the air...

09:32.927 --> 09:34.485
and carry you before
the whole goddamn camp...

09:34.567 --> 09:37.127
like a fucking turtle
with its legs wiggling.

09:48.207 --> 09:52.086
You go on and wait. Hey! Hey, Adams.

09:53.167 --> 09:55.522
- Where's Hawkeye?
- I don't know. What did he do?

09:55.607 --> 09:57.757
- Al's looking for him.
- For what?

09:57.847 --> 09:59.246
You're about to take
a goddamn beating...

09:59.327 --> 10:02.285
for every fucking time I've been asked,
"What for?" already today.

10:03.647 --> 10:07.003
Any chance Al wanted Hawkeye
to ask him where I was?

10:07.727 --> 10:09.763
I got to take a shit.

10:09.847 --> 10:11.758
- Put it off.
- Won't be put off.

10:11.847 --> 10:14.077
Besides, it ain't the kind
that takes that long.

10:14.167 --> 10:15.725
I'm waiting.
I ain't going back empty-handed.

10:15.807 --> 10:17.798
Fine, fuck it. Just keep your distance.

10:19.367 --> 10:21.244
Just 'cause I'm looking for a bottle...

10:21.327 --> 10:24.125
I might have misplaced
during my drinking days...

10:25.927 --> 10:28.441
does not mean if I find a bottle...

10:30.927 --> 10:33.395
that I'm going to fucking drink it.

10:34.647 --> 10:36.080
Jesus Christ!

10:38.887 --> 10:42.197
You... You know whose horse it was?

10:45.047 --> 10:47.117
"Whose horse it was," what?

11:17.167 --> 11:20.045
- You don't bandage him.
- Mr Bullock...

11:21.087 --> 11:24.682
your frame or mine couldn't withstand
a stampeding like that...

11:24.767 --> 11:28.282
never mind the unstable one of a boy
of William's years.

11:28.847 --> 11:32.157
Further, his brain has been hurt
to an extent...

11:32.247 --> 11:35.284
indicated by the loss
of control of his eyes.

11:35.367 --> 11:38.200
His eye movements
are no longer coordinated.

11:45.407 --> 11:48.922
Might it be of some comfort,
his mother talking to him...

11:49.047 --> 11:51.038
for him to hear her voice?

11:53.647 --> 11:55.160
It might well.

11:58.447 --> 12:00.119
His father's, too.

12:16.847 --> 12:21.762
Tell your wife that it won't hurt him
to put a cloth to his brow.

12:28.647 --> 12:30.285
Just stand there?

12:30.727 --> 12:33.161
No, build yourself a fucking shrine.

12:33.247 --> 12:36.080
No, I mean, should I knock
and let Doc know I'm there...

12:36.167 --> 12:38.283
and then stand the fuck outside?

12:38.727 --> 12:41.878
- Yeah, do that.
- Thanks, Trixie.

12:44.607 --> 12:47.280
The cocksucker upstairs
sends his retriever out to collect me...

12:47.367 --> 12:49.244
with instructions
I'm to wait till summoned.

12:49.327 --> 12:50.999
I suppose then
you should sit the fuck down.

12:51.087 --> 12:52.600
And I come, too...

12:52.687 --> 12:55.838
and find you like you never left
this place to learn your numbers.

12:55.927 --> 12:58.361
Did you teaching me make me
accountable for my whereabouts...

12:58.447 --> 12:59.641
the rest of my fucking days?

12:59.727 --> 13:01.479
If he wants me,
he can fucking come find me.

13:01.567 --> 13:03.239
Why not wait
and find out what he wants?

13:03.327 --> 13:04.965
Why don't you tell me yourself?

13:05.047 --> 13:08.835
- Because I don't know that, Mr Star.
- Other events have a claim to attention.

13:08.927 --> 13:10.406
He knows about other events.

13:10.487 --> 13:13.638
- Ain't you his fucking lapdog, Trixie?
- I ain't nobody's fucking lapdog.

13:13.727 --> 13:15.365
Hard to think even of you
coming to learn numbers...

13:15.447 --> 13:17.517
without its being to his purpose.

13:17.887 --> 13:20.481
Any more to that fucking thought?

13:23.767 --> 13:25.564
I'll have a fucking drink.

13:25.647 --> 13:28.684
Have the horse's piss.
It's on fucking special.

13:30.167 --> 13:33.762
If you couldn't be of use,
he wouldn't have sent for you.

13:38.087 --> 13:40.282
I wish I could help you more.

13:41.327 --> 13:42.760
I've been walking for two hours.

13:42.847 --> 13:45.520
I'm starting to think
that place is a fucking mirage.

13:50.567 --> 13:52.285
Let me take a turn.

13:54.847 --> 13:56.644
Maybe I better not.

13:59.127 --> 14:01.846
- He asked to see Hawkeye first.
- This is Adams!

14:01.927 --> 14:03.963
I know who the fuck it is!

14:04.367 --> 14:07.086
So just shut the fuck up and sit down.

14:15.527 --> 14:19.122
How do you lay claim
to a passable mind while ignoring...

14:19.207 --> 14:23.246
if I'd wanted to do you in, my inviting
the Sheriff up here to witness?

14:23.327 --> 14:26.763
By not putting it beyond your
own mind's quality, Mr Swearengen...

14:26.847 --> 14:28.838
to have enacted the incident
in the thoroughfare...

14:28.927 --> 14:30.997
which then drew the Sheriff away.

14:38.847 --> 14:41.281
Have you come to murder me, Silas?

14:43.207 --> 14:45.118
I wouldn't turn down the chance.

15:07.607 --> 15:12.601
Even swayed at last by my manly
composure, you sign in a false hand.

15:14.167 --> 15:16.556
Mightn't this be my true hand...

15:16.807 --> 15:19.480
and my hand to the hotel register, false?

15:45.527 --> 15:47.518
Wish I had five like you.

16:02.447 --> 16:04.483
I expect that puts you up.

16:20.247 --> 16:23.125
Last thing required
at a child's sickbed...

16:23.207 --> 16:26.643
unlubricated drunk,
sweating and fucking vomiting.

16:27.007 --> 16:29.567
And I ain't one for blood, is my worry.

16:36.127 --> 16:38.516
I may be worse hurting than him.

16:42.287 --> 16:45.120
In whose keeping
would the horse have been?

16:45.647 --> 16:49.959
Whose oversight would have let him
loose and not have seen him pursued?

16:50.087 --> 16:53.159
Every answer lay at the livery.

16:53.447 --> 16:56.996
I propose we put in towards
a white satin comforter...

16:57.087 --> 16:59.806
to be presented to
the injured boy's mother.

16:59.887 --> 17:03.516
"Back in three hours,"
scrawled in nigger...

17:03.607 --> 17:05.915
on a sign pinned to the door.

17:08.926 --> 17:11.441
I wish I'd have caught them leaving.

17:12.166 --> 17:14.601
Torn-up fucking back and all.

17:15.567 --> 17:20.516
Wish I'd have seen them run,
the pure fucking niggerness of it.

17:20.686 --> 17:22.119
Here's Tom.

17:33.807 --> 17:36.116
Take that fucking thing outside.

17:37.687 --> 17:40.724
Outside with it,
leaned somewhere out of sight.

17:57.047 --> 18:01.120
On behalf of all of us,
just to say we're sorry.

18:02.727 --> 18:03.876
Thank you.

18:03.967 --> 18:07.357
Tom Nuttall
bears no more responsibility...

18:07.447 --> 18:09.722
in any fucking way...

18:11.007 --> 18:14.602
to the hurt,
to the Sheriff's boy than I do...

18:14.927 --> 18:19.159
as an innocent,
fucking, helpful bystander!

18:20.247 --> 18:22.522
Jungle fucking niggers!

18:25.967 --> 18:30.438
Before his present troubles and whilst
you pursued your preferred activities...

18:30.527 --> 18:31.596
your partner Bullock...

18:31.687 --> 18:34.963
joined in a campaign
to which I hope you will now subscribe.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.561
What do you mean
"my preferred activities"?

18:37.647 --> 18:40.764
A reference to your people's penchant
for money-getting.

18:40.847 --> 18:42.041
A poor attempt at wit.

18:42.127 --> 18:44.482
- I don't find those funny.
- I apologise.

18:44.567 --> 18:46.398
If you want my help, don't insult me.

18:46.487 --> 18:49.320
Jesus Christ, show me
the secret grip that proves my regret...

18:49.407 --> 18:51.318
and let's be about our fucking business.

18:51.407 --> 18:55.958
Will you salt Adams
with expertise about Helena's politics...

18:56.047 --> 18:59.164
and Butte's,
to be taken by this cunt commissioner...

18:59.247 --> 19:01.238
as samplings of a vein of familiarity...

19:01.327 --> 19:04.797
so rich, wide and deep, as to leave
this commissioner in no doubt...

19:04.887 --> 19:07.959
that Montana, stiff-pricked,
courted Adams...

19:08.247 --> 19:11.478
as Deadwood's representative,
so strenuously towards annexation...

19:11.567 --> 19:14.923
it forced him to flee,
lest he say, "Yes, yes, take us now. "

19:15.007 --> 19:17.567
And yield the virtue of the camp
on the spot?

19:24.847 --> 19:28.078
Yeah, I'll school him.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.201
Does William Bullock
continue unchanged?

19:50.287 --> 19:54.519
As to Ellsworth's proposal of marriage,
which way do you incline?

19:54.807 --> 19:57.002
Do you take us in
from on high then, Trixie...

19:57.087 --> 19:59.965
- and are you privy to all our secrets?
- Which way?

20:01.607 --> 20:05.805
The prospect of Ellsworth,
in the role of father, delights me.

20:05.887 --> 20:10.199
If it's fucking him gives you pause,
he'd never make you.

20:10.287 --> 20:14.075
What gives me pause,
having had the experience...

20:14.367 --> 20:17.200
is the prospect of marriage without love.

20:17.367 --> 20:21.121
Yeah, but when it came to cases,
you took that fucking leap.

20:21.967 --> 20:24.117
Ellsworth waits on your answer.

20:25.887 --> 20:28.401
Whatever you await before giving it.

20:34.167 --> 20:35.486
Bye-bye.

20:47.487 --> 20:49.796
Names and places, Star, as instructed...

20:49.887 --> 20:52.162
leaving it to us as to their deployment.

20:52.247 --> 20:54.556
Butte's got Montana's gold.

20:55.207 --> 20:59.086
Being territorial seat,
Helena might well romance us...

20:59.167 --> 21:01.158
for balance against Butte.

21:03.007 --> 21:06.761
Clark and Daly are the two
strongest men in the territory.

21:06.847 --> 21:08.166
Both from Butte?

21:08.447 --> 21:10.085
Both from gold exclusive?

21:10.287 --> 21:13.916
Clark started in mercantile,
but he's strong in gold now.

21:14.647 --> 21:18.481
- Any chance they might combine?
- No. They fucking hate each other!

21:18.567 --> 21:20.159
Who's the later arrival?

21:20.247 --> 21:23.762
Daly, from Salt Lake,
with Comstock money behind him.

21:23.847 --> 21:27.044
Backed with Comstock money, you'd
consider his connection to Hearst?

21:27.127 --> 21:29.436
What do we know of Clark's ways?

21:30.087 --> 21:33.557
- Clark or Daly?
- Clark, Star! We can't chance Daly.

21:33.647 --> 21:36.081
I don't know Clark's ways
or Daly's, either.

21:36.167 --> 21:38.158
I'm not from fucking Butte, remember?

21:38.247 --> 21:40.602
I wonder if Clark's ever been to Helena.

21:40.687 --> 21:44.805
Yeah, he's been to Helena.
I fucking ate with him once, all right?

21:47.367 --> 21:51.679
Don't tell me you might recall
what type appetite he exhibited...

21:51.767 --> 21:53.200
or his preference as to food.

21:53.287 --> 21:56.359
Don't tell me we might be
fucking getting somewhere.

21:56.687 --> 21:57.676
All right.

22:04.567 --> 22:07.240
- Murder me, someone!
- Quiet.

22:42.207 --> 22:46.678
We slide these under the sled,
lever the cocksucker vertical...

22:46.767 --> 22:50.123
tilt him further forward
and drop him on the sofa.

22:50.207 --> 22:53.916
Why not just run at him
from across the room...

22:54.327 --> 22:56.761
and stab him with all three pitchforks?

22:59.167 --> 23:02.603
- Ain't you gonna cut?
- I have other patients.

23:02.687 --> 23:07.317
I choose not to undertake a futile
and exhaustive procedure.

23:08.447 --> 23:13.043
Guessing through the fat where
his heart is, bullet's lodged too close.

23:14.327 --> 23:16.602
I'm still in fucking discomfort, Doc.

23:17.527 --> 23:19.518
Nurse him, he's herniated.

23:27.567 --> 23:30.127
He's the cardsharp told me about Bill.

23:30.207 --> 23:34.519
I'd punch that cocksucker in the balls,
before I'd cup them for comfort.

23:37.807 --> 23:39.798
All right, slim.

23:44.767 --> 23:46.997
- Hey, Joanie?
- No chance, Leon.

23:58.367 --> 24:02.155
The doctor says that the cloth
to his brow may comfort William.

24:03.767 --> 24:05.519
And being spoken to.

24:09.927 --> 24:12.566
If I had kept him in Michigan...

24:19.607 --> 24:20.596
Yes.

24:22.807 --> 24:24.798
I want to take him home.

24:26.927 --> 24:29.202
Doc says better he's not moved.

24:31.247 --> 24:33.124
There's no better about it.

24:37.367 --> 24:38.595
Is there?

24:49.487 --> 24:52.001
What does the doctor tell us to say?

25:04.687 --> 25:07.247
Mr Merrick, might we have a word?

25:07.327 --> 25:10.558
You and I, Commissioner Jarry,
have nothing whatever to discuss!

25:10.647 --> 25:12.558
Seek your conversations elsewhere!

25:29.327 --> 25:32.763
I hope that will achieve
what the party adjoining us intends.

25:32.887 --> 25:34.081
Thank you.

25:36.167 --> 25:38.840
- So what the fuck do you want with us?
- Shut up.

25:38.927 --> 25:41.487
I hope that even in the gravest
of outcomes...

25:41.567 --> 25:45.480
the Sheriff's crisis could produce
the blessing of our reconciliation.

25:45.607 --> 25:47.916
- I'm listening.
- Well, then shame the fuck on you!

25:48.007 --> 25:51.158
Gentlemen, we are men of experience.

25:51.647 --> 25:56.118
Self-interest is immutable,
but its dictates vary daily.

25:56.247 --> 25:58.841
You talk like you take it up the ass.

25:59.087 --> 26:01.920
I do not, my friend Adams,
take it up the ass.

26:02.007 --> 26:03.565
Don't call me your fucking friend!

26:03.647 --> 26:08.084
But I suspect those that do, consider
that they advance their own interests.

26:08.167 --> 26:12.206
Like them, shall we not pursue
that which gratifies us mutually?

26:12.287 --> 26:13.561
If you'd calm the fuck down.

26:13.647 --> 26:16.320
I'm the one he insulted.
I've got pride, if you fucking don't.

26:16.407 --> 26:18.523
I've got pride,
I just know when to fucking swallow it.

26:18.607 --> 26:19.801
Maybe you take it up the ass!

26:19.887 --> 26:22.447
Jesus fucking Christ,
must I make you leave the room?

26:22.527 --> 26:23.516
Gentlemen.

26:29.167 --> 26:30.725
Tell him what Bullock had you doing.

26:33.167 --> 26:36.637
Tell him what you were doing...

26:37.247 --> 26:38.646
in Montana.

27:23.007 --> 27:26.522
Any turn here,
come get me at the Chez Ami.

27:26.607 --> 27:29.997
- Sure, Doc.
- I'm gonna be operating on a whale.

27:39.567 --> 27:41.205
It strains credulity.

27:42.167 --> 27:43.680
The imagination balks.

27:43.767 --> 27:46.327
I sit here, right,
and he calls me a fucking liar?

27:46.407 --> 27:48.716
No one is calling you a liar, Mr Adams.

27:48.807 --> 27:51.401
In fact, I'm sure even you
would agree, the idea...

27:51.487 --> 27:54.604
of a man conducting the business
of his territory...

27:54.687 --> 27:57.679
- from the back room of a restaurant-
- The Stonehouse!

27:58.367 --> 27:59.595
The Stonehouse...

27:59.687 --> 28:02.485
offering a bounty
for the allegiance of others...

28:02.567 --> 28:04.683
while wearing a bag over his head.

28:04.767 --> 28:07.520
I won't pretend
it didn't strike me strange.

28:07.607 --> 28:11.680
Maintaining anonymity, clearly,
while forming an impression of Adams.

28:12.487 --> 28:15.638
The mind imagines
other paths to the purpose.

28:15.727 --> 28:19.197
I'm giving less and less a fuck
of what you strain and balk at, too.

28:19.287 --> 28:22.199
Apart from what the bag
bespeaks of the wearer...

28:22.287 --> 28:25.438
what concerns me
is their offer for your support.

28:25.647 --> 28:28.764
Ask me what ought to concern us,
is the offer fucking real?

28:28.847 --> 28:32.601
We turn the camp toward Montana,
$50,000 ain't unreasonable.

28:33.047 --> 28:34.844
Though anyone can bandy numbers.

28:34.927 --> 28:37.680
What's unreasonable
is fucking Bullock's quote on his cut.

28:37.767 --> 28:42.443
Clark would have the 50, but was
the man really speaking for Clark?

28:42.967 --> 28:45.162
Consider another alternative.

28:45.287 --> 28:47.960
What if it was Clark who was speaking?

28:51.567 --> 28:55.606
Why would a representative of Clark,
unknown to Adams...

28:55.687 --> 28:58.247
therefore unrecognisable,
never to meet him again...

28:58.327 --> 29:02.684
- conceal his identity beneath a bag?
- Maybe he had open sores.

29:03.247 --> 29:06.364
Clark knew you would be able
to recognise him from photographs...

29:06.447 --> 29:09.564
or at least it was a risk
he might not want to take.

29:15.927 --> 29:17.155
Anyways.

29:17.887 --> 29:22.085
If Deadwood could grant an interval
before answering Montana's offer...

29:22.167 --> 29:26.922
I will convey my impressions to Yankton
and learn whether they wish to counter.

29:27.167 --> 29:30.762
I have no objection.
Though I speak only for myself.

29:30.927 --> 29:34.761
Mr Swearengen, you are far too modest.

29:36.607 --> 29:38.086
Gentlemen.

29:47.687 --> 29:49.086
What just happened?

29:49.927 --> 29:54.603
We knocked the cocksucker up.
And soon he will find himself delivering.

29:54.687 --> 29:56.518
- The 50?
- Elections.

30:02.727 --> 30:05.958
- I wonder how that boy is doing.
- Ain't my department.

30:11.247 --> 30:14.000
You could put yourself to more distance.

30:14.527 --> 30:16.916
I'm scared to go off in the dark.

30:17.767 --> 30:19.678
I can't piss when I'm scared.

30:23.767 --> 30:25.962
What about Oregon, Hostetler?

30:27.527 --> 30:29.279
You could be my apprentice.

30:30.447 --> 30:33.723
Carry love notes
from pot-gut shitheads...

30:33.807 --> 30:37.004
to those fat-ass women
that they keep on the side.

30:42.167 --> 30:45.796
I'm gonna catch that son of a bitch
and take him back to camp.

30:47.727 --> 30:50.241
That could bring about some killing.

30:50.927 --> 30:54.078
Kill the horse, that's on them.
I guess it's their right.

30:54.447 --> 30:56.802
But they ain't gonna get to kill me.

30:56.887 --> 30:58.081
'Cause when it comes to them cases...

30:58.167 --> 30:59.839
you'll blow your own fucking head off.

30:59.927 --> 31:01.724
And once you've cheated
those white cocksuckers...

31:01.807 --> 31:04.480
won't they just roll around
and gnash their teeth?

31:04.567 --> 31:06.523
What do you mean cheat?

31:06.967 --> 31:09.242
"God damn, Hostetler beat us.

31:09.327 --> 31:12.046
"He done come out victorious
with his fucking head blowed off. "

31:12.127 --> 31:15.836
I ain't never cheated
no white cocksucker in my life.

31:17.167 --> 31:19.727
For that matter, no nigger, either.

31:20.527 --> 31:23.041
They ain't hung you yet, Hostetler.

31:23.967 --> 31:26.401
And maybe
they won't even get the chance.

31:27.367 --> 31:30.359
But they sure have made you
crazy with pride.

31:37.727 --> 31:40.400
A man that did go back to tell his part...

31:41.767 --> 31:44.520
and brought the horse
that he set loose...

31:44.887 --> 31:47.560
to them that he caused to suffer...

31:48.887 --> 31:53.403
paid respect
for the pain that he couldn't fix.

31:55.247 --> 31:58.000
Now if and it, it happened...

31:59.487 --> 32:01.443
that they forgive him...

32:02.447 --> 32:06.759
so he didn't have to do to hisself
what he wouldn't let be done to him...

32:09.567 --> 32:13.606
well then, I guard,
that man might think...

32:15.247 --> 32:16.566
setting forth afterwards...

32:16.647 --> 32:19.445
with whatever fucking loudmouth
went along with him...

32:22.607 --> 32:25.758
that if he made it to Oregon alive...

32:35.567 --> 32:38.081
the two of them might open a livery.

32:45.647 --> 32:48.115
Then let's find that fucking horse.

32:57.407 --> 33:01.036
- Back among friends.
- With what increase in knowledge?

33:01.447 --> 33:03.915
Mr Merrick proved reticent...

33:04.007 --> 33:05.918
so I made a call to the Gem Saloon...

33:06.007 --> 33:08.475
where Swearengen
and that young cutthroat, Adams-

33:08.567 --> 33:12.242
Yankton's young cutthroat times past,
if memory don't deceive.

33:12.327 --> 33:15.285
Adams, as it happens,
had just returned from Helena.

33:15.407 --> 33:18.126
He was sent there by Swearengen
in order to hear from Montana...

33:18.207 --> 33:20.357
and offer to annex this camp.

33:20.487 --> 33:24.639
It emerges further that, pretensions
to holiness notwithstanding...

33:24.727 --> 33:27.639
your Sheriff Bullock
is the courtship's go-between.

33:28.247 --> 33:29.680
There's all kind of sense in that.

33:29.767 --> 33:30.995
Bullock bedding down
with Swearengen...

33:31.087 --> 33:32.884
being as they just
nearly killed each other.

33:32.967 --> 33:35.800
Might not greed and enmity in Bullock...

33:35.887 --> 33:37.559
be served by passing on
to Swearengen...

33:37.647 --> 33:39.956
an overture beneficial
to Bullock's pocket...

33:40.047 --> 33:43.801
requiring of Swearengen
the demeaning business of filling it?

33:44.407 --> 33:46.796
What did
the Helena conversations produce?

33:46.887 --> 33:50.197
An offer of $50,000
for Swearengen to back Montana.

33:50.967 --> 33:54.482
He's losing his belly for the grift.
I'd have said they offered 100.

33:54.567 --> 33:57.479
Impossible, certainly,
to know what offer was made...

33:57.567 --> 34:00.923
and if made, would be honoured
by Montana in the act.

34:01.007 --> 34:02.520
Will they entertain other offers?

34:02.607 --> 34:06.282
That Swearengen traffics in bribes,
I testify to firsthand.

34:09.407 --> 34:13.559
That your employer is a man of means,
you have amply demonstrated.

34:14.447 --> 34:16.677
Swearengen putting himself
up for auction...

34:16.766 --> 34:20.043
as he has not hitherto without
the stipulation of local appointments...

34:20.127 --> 34:22.561
is the development of consequence.

34:22.647 --> 34:26.275
Let the Montana offer be real,
or a fraud of his concoction...

34:26.367 --> 34:28.562
Swearengen is certainly real.

34:29.527 --> 34:34.317
Your employer will have to decide
whether he wants to pay Swearengen...

34:34.487 --> 34:37.206
and not quibble over
his pumping the price.

34:37.447 --> 34:41.042
And let those who are dismayed over
the enlistment of Swearengen...

34:41.127 --> 34:45.405
recall that combat makes comrades,
and be resigned.

34:46.286 --> 34:49.279
Biggest fish I ever seen
landed, Commissioner.

34:49.766 --> 34:51.643
Did I say that resigned enough?

34:51.726 --> 34:54.002
Had Swearengen word of Bullock's boy?

34:54.087 --> 34:57.762
It's surprising which comrades
will show up sentimental.

35:23.687 --> 35:28.363
Trixie asked me to thank you for finding
her error in numbers this afternoon.

35:36.327 --> 35:39.000
Ducks have landed
on the Spearfish pond.

35:41.647 --> 35:44.605
Father's eager
to hear you sound your calls.

35:49.247 --> 35:51.203
Hear you calling them in.

36:02.127 --> 36:04.595
I'm proud of the calls you've made.

36:06.607 --> 36:09.804
I've much enjoyed
showing you how to make them.

36:10.167 --> 36:12.601
Now you make them better than I do.

36:16.087 --> 36:19.636
Thank you for caring for your mother...

36:21.487 --> 36:24.081
at times when I'm away.

36:25.567 --> 36:28.286
It's a comfort to know you are with her.

36:30.167 --> 36:33.716
I am much pleased
now that we all can be together.

36:35.207 --> 36:37.437
I am so much pleased, William.

36:38.407 --> 36:39.965
As is your father.

36:44.967 --> 36:46.446
All the ducks...

36:48.567 --> 36:50.159
and your garden...

36:51.607 --> 36:55.202
helping your mother,
and that we love you.

37:00.167 --> 37:01.919
Rest now, William.

37:03.207 --> 37:06.358
We'll rest and rise together.

37:15.807 --> 37:18.241
Account for yourself, Richardson.

37:20.687 --> 37:23.121
I'm praying for the Sheriff's boy.

37:23.647 --> 37:25.956
To the god of antlers and hooves?

37:26.047 --> 37:29.084
It protected Mrs Garret
when she walked alone at night.

37:31.207 --> 37:34.119
I'm asking it to bless his journey.

37:35.247 --> 37:38.557
Pray away then, moron,
for all the harm you will do.

37:42.607 --> 37:45.201
But leave off when the guests ascend.

38:53.327 --> 38:55.841
Why ain't you among the circumcised?

38:59.727 --> 39:02.116
The day saw advances, Trixie.

39:03.887 --> 39:05.479
None miraculous.

39:08.727 --> 39:10.365
Where's the gimp?

39:13.047 --> 39:15.117
On watch outside Cochran's.

39:16.007 --> 39:17.918
Why not stand with her?

39:44.407 --> 39:49.117
Oh, no. Gimp. Can't hold the cup.

40:59.647 --> 41:02.719
The hoof hits just one inch to the right...

41:02.807 --> 41:06.561
the boy's pain is gone,
they don't have to watch him suffer.

41:06.847 --> 41:09.600
I doubt he's omniscient.

41:09.727 --> 41:12.400
I know he's myopic.

41:12.607 --> 41:16.043
Why don't you concentrate
on the fucking task at hand?

41:17.247 --> 41:18.475
Go on.

41:21.047 --> 41:22.366
Hold this.

41:24.207 --> 41:28.598
Now, we may not be able to find
the bullet...

41:28.687 --> 41:30.962
in and amongst the adipose tissue.

41:31.047 --> 41:34.403
Or, finding it,
we mayn't be able to remove it.

41:35.207 --> 41:38.324
Or, removing it, to avoid killing him.

41:40.367 --> 41:43.837
I guess we could give it a fucking whirl.

41:54.207 --> 41:56.004
My name is Cramed.

41:56.087 --> 41:58.760
I've heard a boy is trampled
and like to die.

41:58.847 --> 42:00.519
You look familiar.

42:00.607 --> 42:03.440
I came last year to hustle dice,
took sick with plague.

42:03.527 --> 42:07.122
- I minister now in Lead.
- How's the new racket pay?

42:12.327 --> 42:15.842
Knowing this camp's without a minister,
I come to be on call to the family.

42:15.927 --> 42:18.760
Shall I ask elsewhere
or will you tell me their name?

42:18.847 --> 42:20.075
Bullock.

42:20.487 --> 42:23.843
- Their boy is at Cochran's cabin.
- Thank you.

42:25.687 --> 42:28.884
- $2 a room, if you're staying over.
- I may.

42:29.447 --> 42:31.165
50 cents off for clergy.

42:31.247 --> 42:34.205
$6 extra if they set up
for dice in the room.

42:37.207 --> 42:41.519
Avoid looking left as you exit
if idolatry offends you.

43:24.207 --> 43:26.198
Good evening, Richardson.

43:28.087 --> 43:30.476
I will take the air very briefly.

43:30.727 --> 43:35.517
I've left my door ajar indicating my trust
for you, which you've well earned...

43:35.847 --> 43:38.520
in days past, escorting me so reliably.

43:39.247 --> 43:41.522
Will you stand in the hallway above...

43:41.607 --> 43:44.963
so that you may answer
if Sofia wakes and calls out?

43:48.927 --> 43:53.717
"Your mother is just away, Sofia,
very, very soon to return...

43:54.287 --> 43:56.960
- "and all is well. "
- Yes, ma'am.

44:01.207 --> 44:05.883
Perhaps without going inside,
as this might frighten her.

44:06.007 --> 44:07.076
Yes.

45:59.527 --> 46:00.516
Fuck.
