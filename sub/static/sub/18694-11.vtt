attention, please?

To the bride and groom.

00:14.675 --> 00:15.941
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

00:15.977 --> 00:17.221
One more time,
I missed it there, Clark.

00:19.013 --> 00:21.547
For Hodgins.

Or anyone else.

00:41.035 --> 00:43.369
Don't forget, I am still
technically your boss, Clark.

00:43.404 --> 00:45.304
At least until next week.
Oh, that's right.

00:45.339 --> 00:47.517
- When do you leave on your big trip?
- First thing Friday morning.

00:47.541 --> 00:49.375
I still can't believe
you got Cam to leave

00:49.410 --> 00:50.876
for six months.

00:50.911 --> 00:52.311
Well, it's been eight years

00:52.346 --> 00:53.763
since I've had a vacation--
I was overdue.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.620
Before we let Arastoo
get away,

00:55.656 --> 00:58.156
let's take an interns picture.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.891
Daisy, none of us
are interns anymore.

00:59.927 --> 01:00.840
Oh, there's Angela.

01:00.864 --> 01:03.764
Whoa!
My bad. My bad.

01:03.864 --> 01:04.864
Cam. Cam?

01:04.897 --> 01:06.932
I'll be back, babe.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.266
Maybe you can help.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.535
There's a gift
without a card.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.681
The problem is, I don't know how

01:11.705 --> 01:13.839
to categorize it
on my spreadsheet.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.941
Don't worry about it.
Just have fun.

01:15.976 --> 01:18.443
Oh, look at me.
I am.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.245
Then I will leave you to it.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.414
Oh, uh,
thank you again

01:22.449 --> 01:25.283
for taking care of everything
for Zack's hearing tomorrow.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.718
Dr. Hodgins and I
have it covered.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.954
Besides, we have to get used

01:28.989 --> 01:30.288
to solving cases without you.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.757
I was gonna wait
until tomorrow to tell you,

01:32.793 --> 01:35.727
but who knows, maybe the drinks
are getting to me...

01:35.762 --> 01:38.630
Anyway, um, I'm considering
handing over my role

01:38.665 --> 01:42.767
as administrative head
of the Jeffersonian.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.870
Truth is, I don't know
where the next chapter

01:44.905 --> 01:46.571
of my life's gonna
take me, so...

01:46.607 --> 01:48.707
If you do decide
to find a replacement,

01:48.742 --> 01:49.908
I think we both know

01:49.943 --> 01:52.611
who the obvious
choice would be.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.079
I agree.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.458
Anyway, we don't need
to talk about this now.

01:55.482 --> 01:57.349
I just... it's something
to think about.

01:57.384 --> 01:59.651
And just so you know,

01:59.686 --> 02:00.930
Christine's trying to give
Michael Vincent a wet willy.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.120
Oh, Christine!

02:02.155 --> 02:04.422
You could perforate
his eardrum.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.791
Cam, it's time.
No, no, no, Felicia.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.158
I told you no bouquet toss.

02:08.195 --> 02:10.195
The number of weddings
where I've almost been

02:10.229 --> 02:11.608
knocked out by
overzealous bridesmaids... No!

02:11.632 --> 02:13.431
Move out of the way,
ladies.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.504
This bouquet is mine.

02:20.607 --> 02:23.074
Okay, here I go.
Is everyone ready?

02:23.110 --> 02:24.509
Throw it now.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.946

It's nothing.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.157
What's important is
that you're happy.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.548
- I am.
- Arastoo's a great guy.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.884

as you and Brennan,

03:05.919 --> 03:07.485
I will consider it
a success.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.322
Okay, I think I'm probably
one too many drinks in

03:10.357 --> 03:11.436
to be holding a child.

03:11.460 --> 03:13.025
Oh, yeah, that's
really comforting.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.960
Man!
Real comforting, Aubrey.

03:14.995 --> 03:15.776

03:15.800 --> 03:17.626
Okay, but he's gonna hurt
in the morning, huh?

03:18.165 --> 03:19.464
You want to go find Mom?
I'll see you soon.

03:19.488 --> 03:20.399
Okay.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.633
Come on, let's go, buddy.

03:21.668 --> 03:23.134
Mrs. Vaziri?

03:23.170 --> 03:24.859
I'm actually not
changing my name.

03:24.883 --> 03:25.571
Oh, so sorry.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.350
I just wanted to inform you
we've moved your personal items

03:27.374 --> 03:29.341
from the changing area
into your car.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.576
Oh, thank you very much.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.581
Hello.

03:36.617 --> 03:40.752
Hi. Yes, I, uh, I'd like
to say a couple words.

03:42.489 --> 03:46.825
So, as most of you know,
I'm Cam's daughter.

03:46.860 --> 03:50.295
Which means I know better
than anyone

03:50.330 --> 03:54.366
that my mom can be stubborn,
to say the least.

03:56.770 --> 04:00.171
So she's not easily
swept off of her feet.

04:00.207 --> 04:01.906
But when it came to Arastoo,

04:01.942 --> 04:04.376
it was clear immediately

04:04.411 --> 04:05.910
that she was meant
to be with him.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.947
And even she couldn't deny it.

04:08.982 --> 04:12.951
So, Mom, Arastoo,

04:12.986 --> 04:16.321
I love you both so much.

04:18.225 --> 04:21.826
And I wish you a long
and happy marriage.

04:21.862 --> 04:25.930
Cheers.

04:26.967 --> 04:31.069
And without further ado,

04:31.104 --> 04:33.138
I'd like to invite
the happy couple

04:33.173 --> 04:34.906
onto the dance floor.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.338
Ah, thank you.

05:40.373 --> 05:41.906

05:41.942 --> 05:43.074
11:00.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.509
11:00? I have to...

05:44.544 --> 05:46.644
No.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.812
I have to do nothing?

05:47.848 --> 05:49.981
Wow. This is nice.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.584
Not a bad way
to start our new life.

05:52.619 --> 05:55.053

05:55.922 --> 05:57.522
Mmm...

05:57.557 --> 05:58.568
Uh-uh-uh!
What are you doing?

05:58.592 --> 05:59.724
I am not working.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.659
I am just checking
on Michelle.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.028
Oh, she already
texted me.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.097
"Saw your purse sitting
on the chair in the tent.

06:06.133 --> 06:09.667
I grabbed it. Go back to sleep
and stop worrying about me."

06:09.703 --> 06:11.069
She knows you well.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.674
Whoa, looks like I've
got eight voice mails.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.610
It's probably just
congratulations.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.378
Yeah, I don't think so.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.016
It sounds like something serious
has happened at the lab.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.919
They need me to come in.
Today?

06:35.395 --> 06:36.594
I got them, too.

06:36.630 --> 06:40.331
Oh, shoot, my ID's in my purse.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.599
I got it.

06:41.635 --> 06:44.335
Okay.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.738
Somebody talk to me.
What is happening?

06:46.773 --> 06:49.174
It appears Ms. Warren's
initial assessment is correct.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.542
Gunshot wound to the head.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.044
Okay, who's the victim?
We're not sure yet.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.223
So you called us in, and you
don't even have ID?

06:54.247 --> 06:55.814
This isn't exactly
a normal case.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.850
Seriously, guys, tell me,

Angie, we said we weren't
gonna talk about that tonight.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.945
Yeah, sorry, I just...

07:59.980 --> 08:00.990
I can't stop
thinking about...

08:01.014 --> 08:03.415
Whoa!

08:03.450 --> 08:05.350

08:05.386 --> 08:07.853

08:11.425 --> 08:13.558
Wow, that's not bad.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.994
Angela, we need you.

another drink, or,

08:22.236 --> 08:24.002
you know what,
make it two, actually.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.203
Wow, coming right up.
Guys.

08:25.239 --> 08:27.406
Dr. Hodgins, neat setup.

08:27.441 --> 08:29.307
Very Bunsen Jude.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.987
I think I'll have
the Saroyan Sling, please.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.477
Coming right up.

08:32.513 --> 08:35.080
You know, for someone
who's about to defend

08:35.115 --> 08:37.115
his best friend
in a murder trial in 15 hours,

08:37.150 --> 08:39.284
you are very calm.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.663
Please, with the evidence
that we've got,

08:40.687 --> 08:43.822
that case is a slam dunk.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.628
Zack, looking good,
my friend.

08:49.663 --> 08:52.431
I like the power tie.
Thank you.

08:52.466 --> 08:54.310

08:54.334 --> 08:56.935
Yeah, okay, Zack, Zack.
I-I get it.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.438
Zack, you sure you want
to represent yourself?

08:59.473 --> 09:01.406
I mean, we can request
a continuance.

09:01.442 --> 09:04.075
No, I've had many years
to study courtroom procedure.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.610
I am ready.
Zack will be fine.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.913
Besides, the opposing
lawyer is...

09:07.948 --> 09:09.392
Is a fierce vision
by the name of Caroline Julian?

09:09.416 --> 09:11.518
Is that what you were
going to say, <i>Cher?</i>

09:11.542 --> 09:12.318
No.

09:12.319 --> 09:16.555
Dr. Hodgins, did I just see
your wife looking green

09:16.590 --> 09:17.989
and running
to the ladies' room?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.524
Is Angela feeling unwell?

09:19.560 --> 09:21.059
I wouldn't blame her.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.739
Those drinks you mixed
had me thinking about

09:22.763 --> 09:24.707
giving my corn flakes
a second viewing this morning.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.365
I'll make sure
that Angela's okay.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.601
Meanwhile, what time does
this shindig get started?

09:29.636 --> 09:34.439
I want to take my buddy here
to a celebratory lunch.

09:34.475 --> 09:36.152
Upon recovering the body of
Gormogon's original apprentice,

09:36.176 --> 09:38.844
we found blood on his clothing
that was an exact match

09:38.879 --> 09:40.145
to the victim.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.580
It suggests <i>he</i>
committed the murder

09:41.615 --> 09:43.215
before he himself died.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.549
But didn't the defendant--

09:44.585 --> 09:47.185
that is to say,
didn't <i>I</i> confess?

09:47.221 --> 09:48.386
It was a false confession,

09:48.422 --> 09:49.888
one you have since rescinded.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.357
Thank you, Dr. Hodgins.

09:54.294 --> 09:57.696
Dr. Hodgins, in your
considerable experience,

09:57.731 --> 09:59.431
isn't it rare to find

09:59.466 --> 10:02.701
such unbelievably strong
evidence

10:02.736 --> 10:04.836
nearly a decade after a crime?

10:04.872 --> 10:06.738
It is.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.351
And didn't your colleagues
wonder whether

10:08.375 --> 10:12.077
you might have planted
this oh-so-convincing evidence?

10:12.112 --> 10:13.778
Objection. Hearsay.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.313
No, I'll answer it.

10:15.349 --> 10:19.184
Yes, there were concerns.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.720
Which is why
I established protocol

10:21.755 --> 10:23.822
that no one would
examine evidence alone.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.725
Meaning it was impossible
for even someone

10:26.760 --> 10:28.727
as brilliant as yourself

10:28.762 --> 10:31.029
to plant such
compelling evidence?

10:31.064 --> 10:33.498
Don't answer that.
Nothing further.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.546
What's Caroline doing?

10:47.581 --> 10:49.948
We will move
to closing statements.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.116
Ms. Julian,

10:51.151 --> 10:52.617
you may begin.

10:52.653 --> 10:53.852
Thank you, Your Honor.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.954
While the evidence
presented today

10:55.989 --> 10:58.189
is unusually compelling,

10:58.225 --> 11:01.226
we must consider
the family of the victim.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.628
To reopen these wounds...

11:03.664 --> 11:04.896
What?

11:04.932 --> 11:05.997
No, Zack

11:06.033 --> 11:07.933
is the real victim here.
Order.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.467
Hodgins, please.
No, hold on a second.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.369
What is the point
of the rule of law

11:11.405 --> 11:13.271
if we're gonna lock up
an innocent man?

11:13.307 --> 11:15.707
Order. Would the bailiff please

11:15.742 --> 11:17.976
escort this man
from the courtroom?

11:26.653 --> 11:28.987
What the hell was that?

11:29.022 --> 11:30.689
Caroline is deliberately
sinking our case!

11:30.724 --> 11:33.325
Dr. Hodgins, calm down.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.560
Whatever you think
of Ms. Julian's work,

11:35.596 --> 11:38.163
making a scene did
nothing to help Zack.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.265
Damn it.

11:41.435 --> 11:43.368
Brennan, you got
to get back in there.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.236
Someone who cares about Zack
needs to be there

11:45.272 --> 11:47.339
when his life sentence
is upheld.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.315
Hello.

11:57.351 --> 11:59.017
Dr. Ringler?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.519
Oh. Hey, Aubrey.

12:01.555 --> 12:04.155
No, I ju... I thought you...
It doesn't matter.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.590
What do you need?

12:05.626 --> 12:06.891
Aubrey!

12:06.927 --> 12:08.460
Good to see you.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.828
How you feeling this morning?

12:09.863 --> 12:12.931
To be honest,
about like our victim.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.377
Hey, don't blame me,
I just mixed the drinks.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.668
You're the one
that downed a dozen of 'em.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.637
All right.
What have we got here?

12:18.672 --> 12:20.650
Based on cranial sutures,
it looks like this guy is in

12:20.674 --> 12:22.941
his late 20s. Hard to
determine race at this time.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.454
What about his clothes?
Looks like his pants,

12:24.478 --> 12:26.277
shirt are made of denim.

12:26.313 --> 12:27.345
Canadian tuxedo?

12:27.381 --> 12:29.814
Nice, but no.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.317
This denim is low quality
and the stitching is shoddy.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.085
This looks more
like a prison uniform.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.954
There's a prison
not far from here.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.722
It's about a mile this way.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.524
Look here,
there's trauma on the skull.

12:39.559 --> 12:40.992
I think it's a gunshot wound.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.160
That's a nice find.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.062
Thank you.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.209
Well, uh...

12:46.233 --> 12:48.033
listen, if this guy
did escape from prison,

12:48.068 --> 12:49.846
he had to have made his way
through these woods,

12:49.870 --> 12:51.381
so I'm gonna head this way,
see what I can find.

12:51.405 --> 12:52.971
Jessica, you should go with him.

12:53.006 --> 12:53.972
Why?

12:54.007 --> 12:55.206
Could be fun.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.176
Uh...

12:58.211 --> 12:59.377
Jessica, just go.

12:59.413 --> 13:01.546
Okay?

13:03.250 --> 13:04.582
Yeah, can't hurt.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.822
Whoa.

13:10.857 --> 13:12.857
What's this little guy
doing here?

13:17.364 --> 13:18.830
Cam, two inmates escaped
from prison.

13:18.865 --> 13:21.099
One named Fred Walden.
The other one is...

13:21.134 --> 13:23.835
The other one is Mark Kovac.
Oh, my God.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.815
Wait, Mark Kovac. Isn't that
the guy who killed Max?

13:25.839 --> 13:27.672
Yes.

13:27.708 --> 13:29.052
Now, clearly,
we've found one body,

13:29.076 --> 13:30.542
but the other guy
is still out there.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.210
The problem is,
we don't know which one.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.545
Can't we use age
and race markers

13:33.580 --> 13:34.879
to try to tell them apart?

13:34.915 --> 13:36.948
Unfortunately, no,
because both men's profiles

13:36.983 --> 13:38.349
are roughly the same, but Angie,

13:38.385 --> 13:39.962
she's working up
a facial reconstruction.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.021
Dr. Saroyan, Dr. Vaziri,
I hate to press you into service

13:43.056 --> 13:44.789
so soon after
your nuptials.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.524
Hey, guys.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.992
I have some bad news.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.628
Please don't tell me
this is Fred Walden.

13:52.566 --> 13:54.444
Which means somewhere out there
is a man who wants to...

13:54.468 --> 13:56.568
Wants to kill me and my family.

14:04.083 --> 14:06.849
For someone who's defending his
best friend in a murder trial

14:06.850 --> 14:08.916
in 15 hours, you
are very calm.

14:08.952 --> 14:10.818
Please. With the evidence
we got, that case

14:10.854 --> 14:12.253
is a slam dunk.

14:12.289 --> 14:14.322
I see too much standing around

14:14.357 --> 14:15.357
and not enough dancing!

14:16.426 --> 14:17.959
One Arast-ini, gorgeous.

14:17.994 --> 14:19.227
Thank you.

14:19.262 --> 14:20.762
What a gentleman,

14:20.797 --> 14:23.398
getting a drink for that
pretty little redhead of yours.

14:23.433 --> 14:25.633
Oh. Actually, uh,
these are both for me.

14:25.669 --> 14:27.435
Wow. Anxious about the big move?

14:27.470 --> 14:29.148
I guess you could say that.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.650
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'm grateful

14:30.674 --> 14:32.307
for the opportunity,
it's just...

14:32.342 --> 14:34.709
You haven't asked Jessica
to move with you yet.

14:34.744 --> 14:36.555
It's just so awkward.
I don't want to pressure her

14:36.579 --> 14:38.613
to move her whole life.
And to be honest with you,

14:38.648 --> 14:40.281
I've kind of been avoiding her.

14:40.317 --> 14:41.761
Well, at least you're
considering her point of view.

14:41.785 --> 14:44.552
Which is a sign
of a healthy relationship.

14:44.587 --> 14:46.554
Of course, you're also avoiding
her, which isn't.

14:46.589 --> 14:49.023
I should probably just rip off
the Band-Aid, right?

14:49.059 --> 14:50.658
You know what helps with that?
Balls.

14:50.694 --> 14:51.959
I w... wa...

14:51.995 --> 14:54.562
was gonna say alcohol, but...

14:54.597 --> 14:57.465
Look.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.178
This bouquet is mine.
This is your future.

14:59.202 --> 15:00.435
You just have
to seize it.

15:01.338 --> 15:02.570
Oh, boy.

15:04.474 --> 15:06.341
See?

15:18.421 --> 15:20.521
Holy hangover.

15:26.329 --> 15:28.129
Where am I?

15:28.164 --> 15:31.165
Oh, good. You're up.

15:31.201 --> 15:33.334
- How you feeling?
- Karen.

15:34.571 --> 15:36.337
Did we...?

15:36.373 --> 15:38.873
Aw. Look who's awake.

15:38.908 --> 15:40.975
Okay.

15:41.010 --> 15:42.076
Wha...

15:42.112 --> 15:43.244
Don't be a pig.

15:43.279 --> 15:44.579
Yeah. You got
wastey-face

15:44.614 --> 15:45.947
last night.
We were worried

15:45.982 --> 15:47.682
you were gonna throw up
in the cab.

15:47.717 --> 15:49.684
Karen's place was closer

15:49.719 --> 15:51.786
so she offered to host us.

15:51.821 --> 15:53.287
Okay, well,
that explains this thing.

15:53.323 --> 15:54.789
Sort of.

15:54.824 --> 15:56.824
Well, I think I'm gonna
go make some coffee. Oh!

15:56.860 --> 15:58.471
Jessica, I think
that Aubrey has something

15:58.495 --> 16:00.161
he wants
to ask you.

16:02.198 --> 16:04.332
Yeah,
um, hey,

16:04.367 --> 16:06.167
uh, so, um...

16:07.337 --> 16:09.737
Oh, sorry, I got to get this.

16:09.773 --> 16:12.507
Ow, ow, ow.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.342
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Booth, what's up?

16:14.377 --> 16:16.110
Oh.

16:16.146 --> 16:18.179
A body covered in acid.

16:18.214 --> 16:19.881
Okay. That should help
with the nausea.

16:19.916 --> 16:21.149
Yeah. All right.

16:21.184 --> 16:23.184
Thanks.
What's Booth say?

16:23.219 --> 16:24.419
Brennan's in court,

16:24.454 --> 16:26.320
so you and I got
to go look at a body.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.892
No.

16:30.927 --> 16:32.693
I'll drive.

16:32.729 --> 16:34.262
This doesn't make any sense.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.208
I don't know why Hodgins
insisted I come with you.

16:36.232 --> 16:37.865
I should be with the remains.

16:37.901 --> 16:40.535
What? Trail go cold?

16:41.604 --> 16:43.037
I, uh...

16:43.072 --> 16:44.705
I want you to move
to L.A. with me.

16:44.741 --> 16:46.641
Really?

16:46.676 --> 16:49.644
I mean, I was starting
to wonder.

16:49.679 --> 16:51.546
Is that a yes?

16:51.581 --> 16:53.414
It's an...

16:53.450 --> 16:55.016
I don't know?

16:55.051 --> 16:57.652
I mean, moving
across the country,

16:57.687 --> 16:59.921
with a man who's
not even listening to me.

16:59.956 --> 17:01.022
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17:01.057 --> 17:02.590
Just come over here
for a second.

17:11.434 --> 17:13.901
This must be
how the prisoners escaped.

17:13.936 --> 17:15.203
Looks like it was blown open

17:15.238 --> 17:18.940
from the inside
by some kind of explosive.

17:26.715 --> 17:28.716
Yeah.

17:28.751 --> 17:31.263
Hey. Uh, just wanted you to know
that Kovac's wife's on her way.

17:31.287 --> 17:33.165
I brought her in as soon
as I heard about the escape.

17:33.189 --> 17:34.689
You okay? You still hungover?

17:34.724 --> 17:36.023
Working on it.

17:36.059 --> 17:37.758
Listen, I talked to Hodgins,

17:37.794 --> 17:41.128
He said the grate was blown
open using military-grade HMX.

17:41.164 --> 17:43.064
HMX, that's a powerful
explosive. Come on.

17:43.099 --> 17:44.810
It's not something you can
buy at the prison commissary.

17:44.834 --> 17:46.278
Nope. They had to steal it.
Which means someone's

17:46.302 --> 17:47.835
helping him from the outside,

17:47.871 --> 17:50.004
and we know that Kovac's used
hired guns in the past.

17:50.039 --> 17:51.484
I'll call the Pentagon,
see if there's been

17:51.508 --> 17:53.908
any HMX, uh, thefts
in the past few weeks.

17:53.943 --> 17:55.488
Good thinking. If they
can trace the source,

17:55.512 --> 17:57.845
maybe we can find out
who's helping this guy.

17:57.881 --> 17:59.847
Jeannine Kovac's here.

17:59.883 --> 18:02.016
Go, go, go, go, go.
Talk to her, okay?

18:02.051 --> 18:05.219
We need to find her husband now.

18:07.156 --> 18:11.025
Mark was not at all the man
that I thought I married.

18:11.060 --> 18:12.860
And as soon
as he went to prison,

18:12.896 --> 18:14.695
I served him divorce papers.

18:14.731 --> 18:17.965
So you haven't been in touch
with your ex-husband at all?

18:18.001 --> 18:19.467
No. Not while
he's been in prison.

18:19.502 --> 18:22.003
I want nothing to do with him.

18:22.038 --> 18:24.872
But this morning...

18:24.908 --> 18:26.474
What? You saw him?

18:26.509 --> 18:27.875
No, he called me.

18:27.911 --> 18:31.012
Twice. From a blocked number.

18:31.047 --> 18:32.747
I hung up immediately.

18:32.782 --> 18:34.527
Okay, and which line
did he call? Home, work, cell?

18:34.551 --> 18:35.427
My cell.

18:35.451 --> 18:36.652
Okay.
What I'm gonna do

18:36.653 --> 18:38.886
is bring someone
from our lab over to the FBI.

18:38.922 --> 18:40.555
She's gonna make
a clone of your phone,

18:40.590 --> 18:42.456
we're gonna monitor
all incoming calls.

18:42.492 --> 18:44.492
Does that mean
I have to talk to him?

18:44.527 --> 18:47.628
Hopefully not for long.
But I promise, okay?

18:47.664 --> 18:49.397
We're gonna keep you safe.

18:53.703 --> 18:55.369
James Aubrey.

18:55.405 --> 18:56.515
You look about ten years older

18:56.539 --> 18:58.172
than the last time I saw you.

18:58.207 --> 18:59.207
Well, that makes sense.

18:59.242 --> 19:00.641
Feels like
it was a lifetime ago.

19:00.677 --> 19:01.876
I heard about the Kovac mess.

19:01.911 --> 19:03.778
How's Booth holding up?

19:03.813 --> 19:05.591
Just the way you'd imagine.
He's got his kids at the office,

19:05.615 --> 19:07.148
making sure they're safe.

19:07.183 --> 19:09.183
I thought some French fries
might keep them busy.

19:09.218 --> 19:11.052
How'd Zack's trial go?

19:11.087 --> 19:14.689
As expected, though I made a few
squint enemies in the process.

19:14.724 --> 19:16.068
Really, what do you mean?
Oh, sorry, one sec.

19:16.092 --> 19:17.291
Hey, Booth, yeah.

19:17.327 --> 19:19.527
You hear from your guy
at the Pentagon?

19:19.562 --> 19:23.731
Oh, geez. Okay, all right.
I'll, uh, I'll be right there.

19:23.766 --> 19:24.865
Something wrong, <i>Cher?</i>

19:24.901 --> 19:26.367
I got to get back.

19:26.402 --> 19:28.002
I'll see you.

19:28.037 --> 19:31.272
Hey, Hodgins. Listen,
I got some bad news.

19:34.444 --> 19:36.544
Hey, you. What are
you doing here?

19:36.579 --> 19:37.945
I thought maybe we could talk.

19:37.981 --> 19:39.580
Oh, yeah, sure. Uh...

19:39.616 --> 19:40.881
This isn't really a good time,

19:40.917 --> 19:42.350
but, um, here, let's...

19:42.385 --> 19:44.085
let's talk in here.

19:47.190 --> 19:48.834
You know, actually,
now that I think about it,

19:48.858 --> 19:50.291
maybe this isn't
the best place...

19:50.326 --> 19:52.059
I can't move to L.A.

19:52.095 --> 19:54.795
You... you can't.

19:54.831 --> 19:56.230
I'm sorry,

19:56.265 --> 19:57.965
that was abrupt. I just...

19:58.001 --> 19:59.834
Needed to rip off the Band-Aid?

19:59.869 --> 20:02.570
Look, it's just,
my whole life is here,

20:02.605 --> 20:06.140
and, um, I'm not ready
to take that next step with you,

20:06.175 --> 20:08.175
and it made
me realize,

20:08.211 --> 20:12.580
I think, maybe, we should
actually take a step back.

20:12.615 --> 20:16.017
Wait. A step back?
What are you saying?

20:16.052 --> 20:18.919
I'm saying... I don't think
there's a future for us.

20:18.955 --> 20:22.056
Not in L.A. or...

20:22.091 --> 20:23.457
anywhere.

20:25.995 --> 20:29.497
So... that's it.

20:32.335 --> 20:34.368
Sorry.

20:34.404 --> 20:36.303
This is Angela.
I got to take care of this.

20:36.339 --> 20:38.139
She's got a location on Kovac.

20:38.174 --> 20:39.306
She knows where he is?

20:39.342 --> 20:41.909
Listen, Jessica,

20:41.944 --> 20:45.179
I really want to finish
this conversation, but Booth...

20:45.214 --> 20:46.414
Oh, my God, Aubrey, go.

20:46.449 --> 20:48.082
It's fine. Just go.

20:49.852 --> 20:51.952
Seriously, go.

21:17.275 --> 21:19.275
Avalon, hi.

21:19.311 --> 21:21.411
Hi!

21:21.446 --> 21:23.613
What are you doing here?

21:23.648 --> 21:25.248
Ange, I'm so sorry
to crash your party,

21:25.283 --> 21:28.118
but we don't have
a lot of time.

21:28.153 --> 21:29.753
I need to see Agent Booth.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.454
Booth? Why?

21:31.490 --> 21:32.922
I had a vision.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.725
Okay, um, he might be
kind of tied up right now.

21:35.761 --> 21:38.862
Ange, it's imperative
that I see him.

21:38.897 --> 21:42.265
Okay. Okay.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.767
Well,
I'll go get Booth.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.436
Yeah. Hey, Ange?

21:47.606 --> 21:49.873
Keep yourself safe, huh?

21:54.379 --> 21:55.912
♪ La-Di-da-Di-da ♪

21:55.947 --> 21:57.414
♪ That's just our style ♪

21:57.449 --> 22:00.183
♪ Whoo-ooh-ooh-
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ♪

22:00.218 --> 22:02.685
♪ Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! ♪

22:02.721 --> 22:04.020
♪ La-Di-da-Di-Di... ♪

22:04.055 --> 22:05.655
Hey, sorry to interrupt
you guys.

22:05.690 --> 22:06.278
What?

22:06.302 --> 22:08.125
Booth,
Avalon is here to see you.

22:08.126 --> 22:10.026
Avalon? What is she doing here?

22:10.061 --> 22:11.728
She said something
about a vision.

22:11.763 --> 22:13.062
I-I don't know,

22:13.098 --> 22:15.098
I've never seen her
so worked up, though.

22:15.133 --> 22:16.711
So I'm supposed to miss this
whole party and all this dancing

22:16.735 --> 22:18.301
because she had a bad dream?

22:18.336 --> 22:20.637
I know neither of you believe
in this stuff, but you...

22:20.672 --> 22:22.205
I don't.
...you can't deny

22:22.240 --> 22:23.851
that she's been helpful
to us in the past.

22:23.875 --> 22:26.109
Fine, fine, you know what?
I'll go talk to her.

22:26.144 --> 22:27.444
But she's not gonna
touch my aura

22:27.479 --> 22:29.157
or do anything like that
with the cleaning and stuff

22:29.181 --> 22:31.714
'cause last time, she
was putting stuff...

22:31.750 --> 22:34.284
Remember
when we used to go dancing?

22:34.319 --> 22:37.153
You mean when you would drag me
away from my work to go dancing?

22:37.189 --> 22:39.289
Ah, exactly.

22:39.324 --> 22:43.259
I suppose I owe you a thank you
for getting me out of the lab

22:43.295 --> 22:44.627
every now and then.

22:44.663 --> 22:46.629
Oh, now we have husbands
and kids.

22:46.665 --> 22:49.933
But that doesn't make our
relationship any less important.

22:49.968 --> 22:51.367
What is it they say?

22:51.403 --> 22:55.738
Female friendships before
male romantic partners.

22:55.774 --> 22:59.175
Yeah, yes,
something like that.

23:01.146 --> 23:02.445
To us.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.814
To friendship.

23:06.284 --> 23:09.986
Mm, these are
much too strong.

23:10.021 --> 23:12.856
Not for me.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.266
Angela, is everything okay?

23:23.301 --> 23:25.401
Yes, yes, fine.
I'm fine.

23:25.437 --> 23:27.270
Alcohol acts
as a diuretic,

23:27.305 --> 23:30.473
so I suggest you consume
plenty of fluids

23:30.509 --> 23:32.008
and replenish
your electrolytes.

23:32.043 --> 23:34.377
Thank you.
This is not my first rodeo.

23:34.412 --> 23:36.513
Hurry up, <i>Cher,</i>
we're starting.

23:36.548 --> 23:38.047
I have to go.

23:38.083 --> 23:41.784
Okay, um, I'm fine, really.
I'm totally fine.

23:50.161 --> 23:51.861
Hi, Mrs. Kovac.
Hi.

23:51.897 --> 23:54.063
Let me explain
what I'm gonna do here.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.665
Please call me Jeannine.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.767
I want nothing to do
with that name.

23:57.802 --> 24:00.003
Right, yes, I understand.

24:00.038 --> 24:01.971
Okay, so,
what I'm doing is:

24:02.007 --> 24:03.740
I'm plugging in
your phone,

24:03.775 --> 24:05.975
and the software
will create a clone.

24:06.011 --> 24:08.411
It just means that
when he calls,

24:08.446 --> 24:10.647
we'll be able to
track his location remotely.

24:10.682 --> 24:12.549
Could that work both ways?

24:12.584 --> 24:14.584
I-I don't want Mark
to know where I am.

24:14.619 --> 24:15.885
It's just like
Aubrey said,

24:15.921 --> 24:17.098
we're gonna make sure
you're safe.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.255
Promise.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.723
Maybe you should
grab a cup of tea

24:20.759 --> 24:22.392
and just
take a moment.

24:22.427 --> 24:25.094
Yeah. Yeah,
that'd be great.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.763
Thank you.

24:29.467 --> 24:31.868
Thank you.

24:31.903 --> 24:33.347
This should only take
a couple more minutes.

24:33.371 --> 24:35.772
Okay, sounds good.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.610
Uh, is-is there

24:40.645 --> 24:41.611
something else you need,

24:41.646 --> 24:43.446
or are you just not sure
if you have to pee?

24:43.481 --> 24:45.415
No, I'm good.
Just, uh,

24:45.450 --> 24:47.984
something personal on my mind,
but I guess it'd be, you know,

24:48.019 --> 24:50.119
selfish to talk
about me now, right?

24:51.156 --> 24:53.723
This is about Jessica,
isn't it?

24:53.758 --> 24:55.258
Okay, lay it on me.

24:55.293 --> 24:56.593
You have come
to the right woman,

24:56.628 --> 24:58.361
by the way.
Okay, look, I just--

24:58.396 --> 25:00.374
I didn't know how badly I
wanted her to move with me

25:00.398 --> 25:02.465
until I asked her,
but if she says no,

25:02.500 --> 25:04.834
maybe I should just
tell her I'll stay.

25:04.869 --> 25:06.569
I hate to say this,

25:06.605 --> 25:09.405
but I don't think you can put
that kind of pressure on her.

25:09.441 --> 25:10.940
The ball's in her court.

25:10.976 --> 25:15.244
Yeah, but what if it
doesn't turn out...

25:15.280 --> 25:16.813
the way I want?

25:16.848 --> 25:19.282
Well, then maybe this move
just forced a conversation

25:19.317 --> 25:21.384
that you guys needed
to have anyway.

25:21.419 --> 25:24.988
Yeah, you're
probably right.

25:25.023 --> 25:28.291
Whatever happens,
it's gonna work out.

25:29.928 --> 25:31.628
I used to spend
so much time

25:31.663 --> 25:34.263
looking back
and thinking:

25:34.299 --> 25:37.767
what if I had
made other choices?

25:37.802 --> 25:41.104
And then... I realized

25:41.139 --> 25:44.407
I love my life...
the way it is.

25:46.311 --> 25:49.278
Live for right now.

25:49.314 --> 25:52.448
That's the only thing
you can do.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.484
Thanks.

25:54.519 --> 25:56.619
Told you.

25:56.655 --> 25:58.254
You came
to the right woman.

26:00.458 --> 26:03.092
Okay, looks like
this is done.

26:03.128 --> 26:06.496
So I'll call you the second
that Kovac makes--

26:06.531 --> 26:09.098
makes contact.

26:09.134 --> 26:10.833
Ooh, looks like
Hodgins got you, too, huh?

26:10.869 --> 26:15.238
Yeah, wow.
Yeah, I guess you can say that.

26:29.187 --> 26:30.386
Angela?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.188
Are you okay?

26:32.223 --> 26:35.458
The effects of your hangover
should have subsided by now.

26:35.493 --> 26:36.859
Are you sure
you're not actually...

26:36.895 --> 26:38.194
Pregnant?

26:38.229 --> 26:39.362
I was going to say sick.

26:39.397 --> 26:41.030
Oh, Brennan...

26:42.934 --> 26:47.136
Oh... are you--
are you pregnant?

26:47.172 --> 26:48.738
Yes.

26:48.773 --> 26:51.874
I'm so happy for you.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.710
Aw.

26:53.745 --> 26:55.311
And don't worry,

26:55.346 --> 26:58.014
the alcohol won't affect the fetus...
Oh, no, no.

26:58.049 --> 27:00.349
God, no, I didn't have
any alcohol last night.

27:00.385 --> 27:02.452
Hodgins was
mixing me virgins.

27:02.487 --> 27:04.587
Anyway, this wasn't planned.

27:04.622 --> 27:07.423
So we haven't-- we
haven't told anybody.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.392
Does this mean that
you don't yet know

27:09.427 --> 27:11.894
if the baby has LCA?

27:11.930 --> 27:14.030
We're waiting on a call
from-- from the doctor.

27:14.065 --> 27:16.866
That must be
very stressful.

27:16.901 --> 27:18.468
Yeah, it is.

27:18.503 --> 27:23.406
It was, but then I was
talking with Aubrey earlier

27:23.441 --> 27:26.743
and I realized that
life works out.

27:26.778 --> 27:28.745
Right?

27:28.780 --> 27:30.646
I mean, even if
this baby ends up

27:30.682 --> 27:33.549
not being able
to see our faces,

27:33.585 --> 27:35.852
we're gonna be okay.

27:35.887 --> 27:38.588
We're gonna be
great, even.

27:44.462 --> 27:45.695
I'm sorry to interrupt.

27:45.730 --> 27:47.530
I just got off the phone.
What is it?

27:47.565 --> 27:49.398
Booth just got a call
from the Pentagon.

27:49.434 --> 27:51.400
An entire crate of
HMX went missing

27:51.436 --> 27:53.970
from an army ammunition
plant in Montgomery County.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.483
Kovac would have only needed
a fraction of that

27:55.507 --> 28:00.276
to blow open the grate
near the prison.

28:00.311 --> 28:03.045
Which means Kovac is likely
building another bomb.

28:03.081 --> 28:05.882
At least a thousand
times more powerful.

28:09.159 --> 28:10.308
To us.

28:10.889 --> 28:12.332
To friendship.

28:14.624 --> 28:18.326
Mm, these are
much too strong.

28:18.361 --> 28:20.161
Not for me.

28:20.196 --> 28:22.230
Mommy, Mommy! Look!

28:23.600 --> 28:26.367
You look adorable.
Look at this veil.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.337
Wow, I am actually craving

28:29.372 --> 28:30.838
a third piece of cake.

28:30.874 --> 28:33.674
This is amazing.
I'll be right back.

28:33.710 --> 28:36.477
I'm a bride.

28:36.513 --> 28:38.346
Well, actually,
in the United States,

28:38.381 --> 28:40.381
marriage is illegal
under the age of 18,

28:40.417 --> 28:41.983
but you are
very beautiful.

28:42.018 --> 28:44.585
Daddy gave me his phone
to take pictures,

28:44.621 --> 28:46.154
just like
Auntie Angela.

28:46.189 --> 28:47.722
Smile.
Oh.

28:52.729 --> 28:55.296
Hey, I just saw Booth.

28:55.331 --> 28:57.198
He doesn't look
very pleased.

28:57.233 --> 28:59.434
I hope everything went
all right with Avalon.

28:59.469 --> 29:01.936
Well, I'm sure his aura
is as clean as it's ever been.

29:03.973 --> 29:07.075
That was sarcasm.
I don't believe in auras.

29:07.110 --> 29:08.443
I know.

29:08.478 --> 29:11.379
Well, I suppose I should
collect my family.

29:11.414 --> 29:12.580
What?

29:12.615 --> 29:14.549
Already? No, no.

29:14.584 --> 29:16.918
Come on, we're having
one more dance.

29:16.953 --> 29:18.619
No, the kids have to go to bed

29:18.655 --> 29:20.533
and I have to be up early
for Zack's trial tomorrow.

29:20.557 --> 29:23.391
All right, well...

29:25.462 --> 29:26.928
I'll see you then.

29:28.765 --> 29:31.766
Does the defense have
a closing statement?

29:32.836 --> 29:33.901
No, Your Honor.

29:33.937 --> 29:35.403
I would prefer
to let the evidence

29:35.438 --> 29:36.971
speak for itself.

29:39.275 --> 29:40.908
Actually,
Your Honor,

29:40.944 --> 29:42.176
I'd like
to say something.

29:42.212 --> 29:44.779
If the prosecution
has no objections?

29:48.084 --> 29:51.619
I usually speak
about forensic evidence,

29:51.654 --> 29:53.588
but I'd like
to take a moment

29:53.623 --> 29:56.257
to talk about
Dr. Addy's character.

29:56.292 --> 29:57.525
Working for me,

29:57.560 --> 30:02.163
Dr. Addy assisted in
incarcerating over 50 murderers.

30:02.198 --> 30:04.098
Even while he was
institutionalized,

30:04.134 --> 30:07.768
Zack attempted the impossible:

30:07.804 --> 30:09.303
to find a cure

30:09.339 --> 30:10.905
for Dr. Hodgins' paralysis.

30:10.940 --> 30:13.107
Now, it's true

30:13.143 --> 30:15.343
he made mistakes,

30:15.378 --> 30:19.213
but I still believe in my heart

30:19.249 --> 30:21.516
that the world
would only benefit

30:21.551 --> 30:23.451
from his return to society.

30:25.021 --> 30:27.155
Thank you.

30:31.327 --> 30:33.060
At this time,
I am ready to rule.

30:33.096 --> 30:35.029
Will the defendant please rise?

30:38.668 --> 30:40.613
Had this newly surfaced evidence
been available at the time,

30:40.637 --> 30:43.304
there would not have
been sufficient cause

30:43.339 --> 30:45.373
to bring a charge
of murder.

30:45.408 --> 30:47.441
Therefore, I
am forced to

30:47.477 --> 30:50.778
reverse the conviction
and the life sentence.

30:52.982 --> 30:54.515
However, it
remains clear

30:54.551 --> 30:56.017
that he did assist

30:56.052 --> 30:58.119
a known killer.

30:58.154 --> 31:00.855
Therefore, Dr. Addy will finish
the 13 months

31:00.890 --> 31:03.524
left on his sentence
for said crime.

31:04.594 --> 31:05.893
Adjourned.

31:08.164 --> 31:10.498
Can I have one minute?

31:10.533 --> 31:12.667
Zack, I'm so sorry.

31:12.702 --> 31:15.636
Please, 13 months is nothing
compared to what I was facing.

31:16.906 --> 31:18.773
Ms. Julian,

31:18.808 --> 31:20.441
thank you.
Without you,

31:20.476 --> 31:22.343
none of this would
have been possible.

31:22.378 --> 31:23.556
She tried to keep me imprisoned.

31:23.580 --> 31:24.879
I disagree.

31:24.914 --> 31:27.014
She argued
against your innocence,

31:27.050 --> 31:29.517
but she mentioned
our "compelling evidence"

31:29.552 --> 31:31.018
19 times.

31:31.054 --> 31:32.920
She did what she had to do
to keep her job

31:32.956 --> 31:34.989
and undo your conviction.

31:35.024 --> 31:37.291
Sometimes, not often,

31:37.327 --> 31:39.560
I underestimate
you, Dr. Brennan.

31:40.797 --> 31:42.930
You...

31:42.966 --> 31:45.366
stay out of trouble.

31:46.736 --> 31:49.637
Thank you, again.

32:00.850 --> 32:02.717
I found gunpowder
residue in the wound,

32:02.752 --> 32:04.697
which indicates the victim
was shot at close range.

32:04.721 --> 32:07.622
Dr. Vaziri, I am not concerned
with cause of death.

32:07.657 --> 32:10.458
For all practical purposes,
it is irrelevant.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.260
How can cause of
death be irrelevant?

32:12.295 --> 32:15.529
Tracing the weapon
is immaterial.

32:15.565 --> 32:17.176
It would only matter
if we didn't already know

32:17.200 --> 32:18.200
who the murderer is.

32:18.234 --> 32:21.135
Kovac. So, then what
are we looking for?

32:21.170 --> 32:22.703
We know who the victim is.

32:22.739 --> 32:25.840
We don't yet know why
Kovac chose to escape

32:25.875 --> 32:28.909
with this man in particular.

32:28.945 --> 32:30.878
Strength, perhaps?

32:30.913 --> 32:32.280
I mean, the bones are robust,

32:32.315 --> 32:34.448
and the muscle attachments
are very large.

32:36.753 --> 32:38.419
Dr. Vaziri, I would
like you to leave.

32:38.454 --> 32:40.788
I'm sorry.
Did I do something?

32:40.823 --> 32:43.090
No. I'm not angry with you.
I just need time alone.

32:43.126 --> 32:44.126
Please.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.326
Of course.

33:11.421 --> 33:14.221
Dr. Brennan, while I'm waiting
on the results

33:14.257 --> 33:15.734
from the tox screen,
is there anything

33:15.758 --> 33:18.059
I can do to help you?
I just need more time.

33:18.094 --> 33:20.928
There's... There's something
I'm missing.

33:20.963 --> 33:23.064
It's like I see it,
but I just, I need more time.

33:23.099 --> 33:24.332
Of course.

33:24.367 --> 33:26.100
Hey, Cam.

33:26.135 --> 33:28.002
Booth?
What are you doing here?

33:28.037 --> 33:30.037
Uh, I gave your
bag to Arastoo.

33:30.073 --> 33:31.583
Oh, my purse?
I-I thought Michelle had it.

33:31.607 --> 33:33.274
Uh... yeah, but
don't worry about it.

33:33.309 --> 33:34.953
Can-- listen, can you just
give me a minute for a second?

33:34.977 --> 33:37.144
Booth, this is
not a good time.

33:37.180 --> 33:38.180
I-I need to focus
on my work.

33:38.204 --> 33:39.348
No, I understand.

33:39.349 --> 33:40.726
I just needed to see you.
That's all.

33:40.750 --> 33:42.917
Why?
Where are Hank and Christine?

33:42.952 --> 33:45.419
Kids are fine.
They're back at the FBI.

33:45.455 --> 33:47.555
They're good.
I just, I got worried.

33:47.590 --> 33:50.458
Booth, I assure you
I can take care of myself.

33:50.493 --> 33:51.859
I get it and all,
but last night,

33:51.894 --> 33:53.272
okay, when Avalon,
she pulled me aside...

33:53.296 --> 33:54.328
What? I don't understand.

33:54.364 --> 33:55.730
You're here because of Avalon?

33:55.765 --> 33:56.964
No, not just Avalon, okay?

33:56.999 --> 33:57.965
We're missing something here.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.367
I just...

33:59.402 --> 34:00.835
I have this feeling, all right,

34:00.870 --> 34:02.103
and I'm very skeptical,

34:02.138 --> 34:03.782
and I pull these two cards
from her deck...

34:03.806 --> 34:05.840
Booth, I don't have time
for this.

34:05.875 --> 34:07.475
The man who
killed my father,

34:07.510 --> 34:10.942
who-who killed Aldo, who went after
our children, he is out there.

34:10.943 --> 34:13.349
I understand that, but look
at the cards that I drew, Bones.

34:13.382 --> 34:16.217
You are in danger.

34:28.868 --> 34:31.101
All right.

34:31.137 --> 34:32.369
Oh, Agent Booth.

34:32.405 --> 34:34.138
- Hey, Avalon.
- Thank goodness.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.938
What's up?

34:35.975 --> 34:38.007
Brennan's father
came to me last night,

34:38.043 --> 34:39.710
and he's very worried.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.523
All right, look, I know that you
take stock in all this stuff,

34:41.547 --> 34:43.225
and this mumbo-jumbo things,
but if you tell Brennan

34:43.248 --> 34:45.260
that you're communing with Max,
that's gonna be a problem.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.418
And that's why I've come to you.

34:47.453 --> 34:50.387
So, please...
let me consult the cards.

34:50.422 --> 34:53.824
We got to... I'm missing... ah.
All right, fine, I'm gonna sit.

34:53.859 --> 34:55.993
Okay, we're done.
They're not saying anything.

34:56.027 --> 34:57.361
Choose a card.

35:06.906 --> 35:08.750
Ha, look at that, temperance.
That's a coincidence.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.741
Choose another.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.382
And that's just
what I was afraid of.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.754
Look, Bones can
take care of herself, all right?

35:23.789 --> 35:24.955
This is just...

35:24.990 --> 35:27.391
Don't laugh this off,
Agent Booth.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.426
Your wife is in serious danger.

35:29.462 --> 35:32.396
Okay, right, okay.
Thanks for the update.

35:32.431 --> 35:35.199
You don't believe me

35:35.234 --> 35:36.567
but you will.

35:36.602 --> 35:41.271
Listen, I know you think
I'm a nut...

35:42.675 --> 35:44.875
...but I also know that you know

35:44.910 --> 35:46.743
that I'm not a phony.

35:47.680 --> 35:50.047
So don't ignore me.

35:51.083 --> 35:52.983
All right, um...

35:53.018 --> 35:54.918
you want your cards back?

35:54.954 --> 35:57.921
No. Keep them.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.925
Okay.

36:01.961 --> 36:04.228
Look for the signs.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.875
Michelle?
What are you doing here?

36:17.910 --> 36:19.476
My mom left her purse
at the wedding.

36:19.512 --> 36:21.122
If you stop by the lab,
could you give it to her?

36:21.146 --> 36:22.679
Yeah. No problem.

36:22.715 --> 36:24.793
So, you still haven't answered
me. What are you doing here?

36:24.817 --> 36:28.352
I'm meeting
with Deputy Director Franklin

36:28.387 --> 36:30.387
for my final
round interview.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.155
Wait a second,
you're applying to Quantico?

36:32.191 --> 36:33.557
Wait.

36:33.592 --> 36:34.691
Cam never told me this.

36:34.727 --> 36:36.693
She... doesn't know,

36:36.729 --> 36:38.028
and please don't tell her, okay?

36:38.063 --> 36:39.496
She worries about me so much,

36:39.532 --> 36:41.465
and I just want to surprise her
if I get in.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.711
Of course. Yeah.
So, what time is your...

36:43.969 --> 36:44.935
Oh, my God.

36:44.970 --> 36:47.971
I think that was a bird.

36:48.007 --> 36:49.673
It just flew straight
at your window.

36:49.708 --> 36:50.774
Wait, that's like a...

36:50.809 --> 36:52.276
bad omen, right?

36:52.311 --> 36:54.545
Oh, God, am I gonna
blow my interview?

36:54.580 --> 36:56.324
No, no, no, no, it's just
a silly superstition, okay?

36:56.348 --> 36:57.348
You're gonna be fine.

36:57.383 --> 36:58.315
Okay, yeah, you're...

36:58.350 --> 36:59.316
you're right.

36:59.351 --> 37:01.018
Sorry. Uh...

37:01.053 --> 37:02.152
Wish me luck?

37:02.187 --> 37:03.687
Good luck.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.556
Okay.

37:09.762 --> 37:10.961
What is it, bug boy?

37:10.996 --> 37:12.062
Hey, yeah, Booth.

37:12.097 --> 37:13.063
Calling with an update.

37:13.098 --> 37:14.064
Anything good?

37:14.099 --> 37:15.332
In my department, yeah.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.000
I found a Black Witch moth
by the body

37:17.036 --> 37:18.802
that's not at all native
to this area.

37:18.837 --> 37:20.938
So, what do you think?
It traveled with the victim?

37:20.973 --> 37:22.751
I don't know. I'm gonna need
to analyze it further.

37:22.775 --> 37:24.441
It's pretty cool, though,
I got to say.

37:24.476 --> 37:25.854
You know that there
are actually some cultures

37:25.878 --> 37:27.522
that see this baby
as a harbinger of death?

37:27.546 --> 37:31.582
Yeah, oh, uh... right, okay.
Well, what else?

37:31.617 --> 37:33.428
I also found evidence
on the victim's clothing...

37:33.452 --> 37:35.619
Hodgins, is that Booth?
I need to talk to him.

37:35.654 --> 37:37.032
Uh, hey, Booth,
hold on one second.

37:37.056 --> 37:38.155
Aubrey?

37:38.190 --> 37:39.423
Yeah, Booth, listen, the, uh,

37:39.458 --> 37:40.635
the body that we found out here,

37:40.659 --> 37:41.992
he's wearing
a prisoner's uniform,

37:42.027 --> 37:43.338
and I just found out
how they escaped.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.028
What do you mean, "they"?
How many?

37:45.064 --> 37:45.963
Well, I don't know,

37:45.998 --> 37:47.831
but the nearest prison
to here...

37:47.866 --> 37:49.110
is the one where
Kovac's being held.

37:49.134 --> 37:52.002
Get the body to the lab now.

37:52.037 --> 37:53.804
All right. You want me
to meet you there?

37:53.839 --> 37:56.440
No. I got to go make sure
Hank and Christine are okay.

37:59.311 --> 38:00.277
Dad, look at this one.

38:00.312 --> 38:02.679
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.125
You got to keep
your voice down

38:04.149 --> 38:06.183
so your brother can sleep.
Let me see.

38:07.753 --> 38:08.986
Oh, that's a good one, huh?

38:09.021 --> 38:10.398
Just keep your voice down,
all right?

38:10.422 --> 38:13.457
Okay.
Daddy, look here.

38:13.492 --> 38:16.093
Mommy's face is missing.

38:16.128 --> 38:17.394
What?

38:17.429 --> 38:18.862
Mommy's face.

38:18.897 --> 38:21.732
Let me see that.

38:23.636 --> 38:26.570
Come on, that's just your finger
covering the lens.

38:26.605 --> 38:29.339
Why is my finger so big?

38:29.375 --> 38:31.675
Uncle Aubrey!

38:31.710 --> 38:33.010
- Shh.
- Hi, guys. Oh.

38:33.045 --> 38:34.645
Got anything on Kovac?

38:34.680 --> 38:35.924
He still hasn't called his wife,

38:35.948 --> 38:37.848
but Angela's ready to go,
and just in case,

38:37.883 --> 38:40.150
we sent a bomb squad
to your house.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.754
You okay?

38:43.789 --> 38:45.656
I'm gonna go to the lab.

38:47.226 --> 38:49.504
I understand it, but look
at the cards that I drew, Bones.

38:49.528 --> 38:51.795
You are in danger.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.096
Look, Bones,

38:53.132 --> 38:55.010
I know you don't believe
in this stuff and neither do I,

38:55.034 --> 38:57.401
but my gut is telling me
that something is wrong.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.202
All right? We're
missing something.

38:59.238 --> 39:00.448
I mean, look, is it
so wrong that I wanted

39:00.472 --> 39:01.772
to be near you and see you?
No.

39:01.807 --> 39:04.074
It's not wrong.
I'm glad you're here.

39:07.880 --> 39:10.247
Hey, guys,
sorry to interrupt,

39:10.282 --> 39:12.949
but I just got a location
for Kovac's phone.

39:12.985 --> 39:15.619
It's in a moving car
near Arlington headed south.

39:15.654 --> 39:17.854
The FBI already
dispatched a SWAT unit.

39:17.890 --> 39:19.222
You have to go, Booth.

39:19.258 --> 39:20.724
I know you're worried
for my safety,

39:20.759 --> 39:23.193
but the best thing you can do
is catch him.

39:23.228 --> 39:24.494
This is what we do.

39:28.233 --> 39:32.002
Seeley, hold up.
I need to go to your car.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.603
Why?
My ID was in my purse,

39:33.639 --> 39:35.772
and now I'm not seeing it.
It must've slipped out.

39:35.808 --> 39:37.295
It might not be the best time
to leave with...

39:37.319 --> 39:38.476
Wait, whoa,
whoa, wait a second.

39:38.477 --> 39:39.621
What do you mean
your ID's missing?

39:39.645 --> 39:41.411
My, uh, Jeffersonian
security pass.

39:41.447 --> 39:42.824
I used it yesterday,
but I'm positive

39:42.848 --> 39:43.888
I put it back in my purse.

39:43.916 --> 39:45.015
Angela, do me a favor.

39:45.050 --> 39:45.982
Check the Jeffersonian security.

39:46.018 --> 39:47.150
Okay, why?

39:47.186 --> 39:48.285
I just need to know

39:48.320 --> 39:49.330
the last time
that Cam's ID was used.

39:49.354 --> 39:50.387
Seeley, I just told you.

39:50.422 --> 39:51.388
I know, just do it.

39:51.423 --> 39:53.924
Okay, uh, her ID was used

39:53.959 --> 39:56.393
last night at 2:42 a.m.

39:56.428 --> 39:58.228
to get onto the platform.

39:58.263 --> 40:00.230
Well,
I assure you last night

40:00.265 --> 40:01.443
I was nowhere near
the Jeffersonian.

40:01.467 --> 40:02.711
We got to get
everybody out of here.

40:02.735 --> 40:03.967
The explosives...

40:04.002 --> 40:06.636
that were stolen. The bomb
is here. The bomb is here!

40:06.672 --> 40:09.139
Get everybody out of here now!
Move!

40:09.174 --> 40:12.909
Okay, everyone, listen to me.
Evacuate now.

40:12.945 --> 40:15.445
Leave everything and
proceed to the exit.

40:15.481 --> 40:17.114
We got to leave.
The bomb is here.

40:17.149 --> 40:18.982
No, Booth, the
evidence, I-I just...

40:19.017 --> 40:20.884
No, forget about the evidence.
No, Booth!

40:20.919 --> 40:23.253
You don't understand.
I-I found what we need.

40:23.288 --> 40:25.200
I know how to find Kovac.
Forget about the evidence!

40:25.224 --> 40:26.267
I don't care.
There is a bomb here.

40:26.291 --> 40:28.158
I have to get you
somewhere safe.

40:30.028 --> 40:32.362
Hey, we have to go.
Come on.

40:32.397 --> 40:34.431
Come on, we have to go!

40:34.466 --> 40:35.944
- Let's go, let's go, let's go, hurry!
- Stay calm.

40:35.968 --> 40:37.868
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Let's go. Stay calm.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.203
Cam, what happened?
The lights.

40:40.239 --> 40:44.040
Arastoo,
the door, it's closing.

40:44.076 --> 40:46.576
I can't keep it open. I need you
to override the doors.

40:47.946 --> 40:48.745
Hurry!

40:48.781 --> 40:50.046
I'm trying. It...

40:50.082 --> 40:51.292
the system must've
been tampered with.

40:51.316 --> 40:52.282
It's shutting me out.

40:52.317 --> 40:53.617
Let's go!

41:02.761 --> 41:04.027
Hold the door!

41:05.397 --> 41:07.130
Cam, stand back!

41:07.166 --> 41:08.932
Seeley, no!
It's bulletproof.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.745
Try to get to the basement!
Back, back, back, back, back.

41:10.769 --> 41:11.701
Move, move, move, move.

41:12.571 --> 41:13.970
Let's go, get out.

41:14.006 --> 41:16.306
Wait a second.
Booth, what are you doing?

41:16.341 --> 41:17.519
If they accessed the platform,

41:17.543 --> 41:18.586
there's got to be
a bomb up here.

41:18.610 --> 41:20.043
I'm gonna get the evidence.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.778
No! Leave now!
Bones!

41:21.814 --> 41:24.381
Wait, wait, Angie. Wait.

41:24.416 --> 41:25.282
Hodgins, where are you going?

41:25.317 --> 41:26.283
I understand explosives.

41:26.318 --> 41:28.285
Booth, I can help.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.886
Move the light table, okay?

41:29.922 --> 41:32.823
Underneath.
There's a hatch.

41:37.863 --> 41:39.996
Oh...

41:43.435 --> 41:46.336
Okay.

41:46.371 --> 41:47.437
Booth.

41:47.472 --> 41:49.806
Booth, did you find it?

41:54.179 --> 41:56.279
Oh.

41:56.315 --> 41:58.081
No tripwire.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.694
I just got to cut the lead
to the detonator.

41:59.718 --> 42:01.818
- That's all I got to do.
- Booth!

42:01.854 --> 42:04.154
Are you okay?
You have to talk to us.

42:19.905 --> 42:21.271
Wait.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.479
It's on an electronic repeater.

42:29.514 --> 42:31.248
We got to get out of here.

42:31.283 --> 42:32.782
We got to get to the basement.

42:32.818 --> 42:34.418
Bones, where are you?!
What is happening?

42:34.453 --> 42:35.930
The bomb is
on an electronic repeater.

42:35.954 --> 42:38.355
Oh, God, which means
there's more than one. Angie!

42:38.390 --> 42:39.390
Bones, where are you?!
