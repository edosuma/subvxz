¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:05.239 --> 00:07.272
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:07.341 --> 00:09.742
¶ That started
    from this tropic port ¶

00:09.810 --> 00:11.743
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:11.812 --> 00:14.312
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailin' man ¶

00:14.381 --> 00:16.581
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:16.650 --> 00:19.084
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:19.152 --> 00:21.253
¶ For a three-hour tour ¶

00:21.322 --> 00:24.289
¶ A three-hour tour ¶

00:24.358 --> 00:26.124
[thunder rumbling]

00:26.193 --> 00:28.393
¶ The weather
    started getting rough ¶

00:28.462 --> 00:30.729
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:30.797 --> 00:33.231
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:33.300 --> 00:35.433
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:35.502 --> 00:37.736
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:37.805 --> 00:39.637
¶ The ship set ground
     on the shore ¶

00:39.706 --> 00:42.741
¶ Of this uncharted
      desert isle ¶

00:42.810 --> 00:44.909
¶ With Gilligan ¶

00:44.978 --> 00:47.278
¶ The Skipper too ¶

00:47.347 --> 00:49.281
¶ The millionaire ¶

00:49.350 --> 00:51.816
¶ And his wife ¶

00:51.885 --> 00:54.586
¶ The movie star ¶

00:54.655 --> 00:56.254
¶ And the rest ¶

01:18.379 --> 01:20.312
There's the plane.
              Ah-ha. The plane!

01:20.381 --> 01:22.447
Oh, yeah. Let me see.
Let me see.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.683
(Gilligan)
   'Oh, yeah. It is a plane.'

01:25.919 --> 01:29.087
Oh, oh.
It's Wrong Way Feldman!

01:29.156 --> 01:31.256
He's come back..

01:34.761 --> 01:38.163
- Wrong Way!
       - Good to see you.

01:48.909 --> 01:51.576
- Good to see you.
- Oh, thanks, Professor. Thanks.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.479
Girls, why don't you fix
Wrong Way something to eat?

01:54.548 --> 01:55.680
- Okay.
         - Oh, alright.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.349
What about help?
Are they sending a boat?

01:57.418 --> 01:59.485
You won't believe
       what a trip I had.

01:59.553 --> 02:02.553
I had to crash.
I was attacked by a giant Eagle.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.189
- An Eagle. How dreadful.
   - Yeah.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.490
I almost shot it down

02:05.559 --> 02:08.926
until I saw it was
one of ours...American.

02:08.996 --> 02:12.430
Alright, alright, Wrong Way.
  But what about the rescue?

02:12.499 --> 02:16.268
Boy, it took two months to get
this plane off the ground.

02:16.336 --> 02:18.469
- 'Two months?'
 - It was in a museum's cellar.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.639
I had a double of a time
gettin' it through the door.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.941
The stairs were alright,
but the door was narrow.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.911
- Are they gonna send a boat?
 - So we can be rescued?

02:25.979 --> 02:28.880
- Did you notify authorities?
 - Certainly not.

02:28.948 --> 02:32.484
- Why would I do that?
- So we can get off the island.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.420
And leave this paradise?

02:35.489 --> 02:38.556
You mean to say that
 nobody knows that you're here?

02:38.625 --> 02:40.859
Oh, to tell the truth,
    I don't know where I am.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.794
Then we're not gonna be rescued?

02:42.863 --> 02:47.098
Of course, not. And you could be
sure that nobody followed me.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.101
I flew with my light off.

02:49.170 --> 02:52.504
Tell me. Why did
             you come back here?

02:52.573 --> 02:55.573
To get away from that horrid
thing you call civilization.

02:55.642 --> 02:57.542
You can have the modern world.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.477
Rush, rush, rush.
Push, push, push.

02:59.546 --> 03:03.281
- I don't want no part of it.
 - But we wanna go home.

03:03.350 --> 03:07.985
My boy, this is your home.

03:08.054 --> 03:12.491
And it's gonna be mine...
       for the rest of my life.

03:17.163 --> 03:18.963
Be reasonable, Wrong Way. You've
gotta go back and get help.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.799
I am not leaving this here
  island. We're better off here.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.236
But Wrong Way, we're homesick,
 we miss the States.

03:24.304 --> 03:25.771
What's there to miss?

03:25.839 --> 03:29.107
All that hustle and bustle,
  the trains, the subways

03:29.176 --> 03:31.476
the whistles, the noise,
    no privacy.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.411
Ho ho. This is the life.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.147
Earth, trees, grass, nature.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.184
But when we get back, you can
go live in Yellowstone Park.

03:39.252 --> 03:43.288
I tried that already.
   Even the bears are civilized.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.690
They wear boy scout uniforms.
   Put out fires.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.593
But Wrong Way, we wanna go back.
Won't you think about it?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.695
There is nothing to think about.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.563
You don't wanna eat
    pineapples and coconuts

03:52.632 --> 03:54.265
for the rest of your life.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.568
That's better than
    what I ate in New York.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.902
What a restaurant that was!

03:57.971 --> 03:59.971
They couldn't even get
    a simple order straight.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.540
All I asked for was
     a plain T-bone steak.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.008
- Steak?
      - 'Yeah, a T-bone.'

04:04.077 --> 04:08.279
And what did they bring me,
  a filet, that thick.

04:08.348 --> 04:09.514
That thick?

04:09.583 --> 04:11.216
I like mine well done, you see

04:11.284 --> 04:13.551
and this was all red
            and juicy inside.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.353
'So I sent it back.
  And they bring me another.'

04:16.423 --> 04:18.089
This was well done alright.

04:18.158 --> 04:21.692
But they put a lot of mushrooms
and that bearnaise sauce.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.197
And I couldn't even
          get the waitress' eye.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.201
She was busy with some glutton
  with a French pastry tray.

04:29.269 --> 04:33.672
'All that chocolate
 and custard and whipped cream.'

04:33.741 --> 04:34.605
That thick?

04:34.674 --> 04:36.674
All that pushin' shovin'.

04:36.743 --> 04:39.478
I don't know what you wanna go
 back there for ever.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.480
- 'Wrong Way.'
         - 'Yeah.'

04:42.583 --> 04:44.650
Tell me about that steak again.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.895
Thurston, I don't
think we should.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.198
Now, there's nothing wrong
   with the old fashioned bribe.

05:00.267 --> 05:03.101
It's the only way I can get
     him to take us back.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.603
I don't think it's gonna work.
He's terribly honest.

05:05.672 --> 05:07.204
Every man has his price.

05:07.273 --> 05:10.275
If he rescues us, I'll promise
  him, one of our oil wells.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.577
You mean you'll give him
one of our oil wells?

05:12.646 --> 05:14.079
I didn't say give.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.281
I said promise to,
           there's a difference.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.283
Don't worry about
    the Old Wolf of Wall street.

05:18.351 --> 05:21.019
- Good luck, darling.
 - You leave. I'll handle him.

05:26.193 --> 05:30.495
I understand that you're really
serious about not going back.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.830
I'm sorry, Howell.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.632
It's something
you would know nothin' about.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.299
It does not concern money.

05:35.368 --> 05:38.837
No, no. You misjudge me. I've
   been doing a lot of thinking.

05:38.905 --> 05:40.905
I don't even think
            about money anymore.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.074
Why? Have we gone off
the gold standard?

05:43.143 --> 05:45.877
No, no, you're laughing at me.
  I agree with you completely.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.912
I think the world's
             in a terrible mess.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.781
And I don't wanna
               leave either.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.784
- You must be kidding.
     - No, no, I mean it.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.785
It's a good thing
that you're not over there

05:54.854 --> 05:56.888
now, with all that spendin'
and buildin'.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.322
Must be terrible.

05:58.391 --> 05:59.757
Oh, with all the money wasted

05:59.826 --> 06:02.027
on factories, buildings
high-rise apartments.

06:02.096 --> 06:03.561
Awful.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.097
And the rents. The landlords
just rakin' it in.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.365
Ghastly!

06:07.434 --> 06:09.200
And those flimsy new apartments
in New York.

06:09.268 --> 06:12.436
- They're so expensive.
  - I know, I know. I own one.

06:12.505 --> 06:14.972
Oh, yes. I was surprised
    to find out

06:15.041 --> 06:18.142
that your rents are the lowest
 in that whole area.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.546
Me? I have the lowest rents.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.848
You will be happy to know
that your building

06:23.917 --> 06:26.251
is the only one
still under rent control.

06:26.319 --> 06:29.521
Leave the others make the money,
you have the peace of mind.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.390
You couldn't stand it
if you was there right now.

06:32.459 --> 06:34.292
Why, the stock market's
gone crazy.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.060
People are makin' money
hand over fist.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.396
Land values are soarin',
and the new tax cuts.

06:38.465 --> 06:41.933
And the bank rates are goin' up.
I tell you, that's a sickness.

06:42.001 --> 06:43.334
Money, money, money.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.969
Stop!

06:45.038 --> 06:48.540
[sobbing]
       Have you no mercy?

06:50.276 --> 06:52.577
(Wrong Way)
    'Musicals are even worse
    than the dramas.'

06:52.646 --> 06:54.278
I've seen seven in New York.

06:54.347 --> 06:57.548
There was one that was any good.
It had this young girl in it.

06:57.617 --> 06:59.184
- About your age.
        - Oh, yeah?

06:59.252 --> 07:00.451
She even looked like you.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.220
Maybe you know her.
Debbie Dorson.

07:02.288 --> 07:05.623
- She was my roommate.
 - She's the toast of Broadway.

07:05.691 --> 07:07.124
I met her back stage.

07:07.193 --> 07:09.861
'Poor girl, with the reporters
 and photographers.'

07:09.930 --> 07:11.996
I could've had that part
    if I was there.

07:12.065 --> 07:16.100
Oh, you're lucky, you didn't.
 Poor kid. No time for herself.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.069
'Rushin' around
     with the movie office'

07:18.137 --> 07:20.238
'and the publicity stills
   and the interviews.'

07:20.307 --> 07:23.007
'What kind of life is that
   for a young girl?'

07:23.076 --> 07:25.643
[sniffling]

07:25.712 --> 07:29.014
That's alright, honey.
You have a good cry.

07:29.082 --> 07:32.283
I feel the same way
about poor Debbie

07:32.352 --> 07:34.820
facin' a life like that.

07:36.923 --> 07:39.957
I tried talking to him too, but
 he's determined to stay here.

07:40.026 --> 07:43.160
But one thing for sure, hasn't
 been good on the morale here.

07:43.229 --> 07:44.862
Ginger hasn't stopped crying
  and Mr. Howell's threatening

07:44.931 --> 07:47.666
to jump of his steamer trunk.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.068
I could fly that plane.
Wrong Way taught me. Remember?

07:50.136 --> 07:53.637
It's ignition, contact, choke,
throttle, stick, flaps.

07:53.706 --> 07:55.573
Say, that's worth a try.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.910
Flaps, choke, throttle,
stick, contact?

07:59.779 --> 08:01.045
Never mind, Gilligan.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.047
You couldn't make it
      to the cockpit.

08:03.116 --> 08:06.117
If there were only some reason
  Wrong Way had to go back.

08:06.186 --> 08:09.386
Yes, a real good reason.
Like an emergency or something.

08:09.455 --> 08:11.289
Hey, that's it. A doctor!

08:11.357 --> 08:15.360
'When I was in the navy, we had
 to send to port for a doctor.'

08:15.428 --> 08:16.628
Maybe you've
            got something there.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.162
I could pretend
I was sick.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.732
You won't have to pretend.
   You'll just mess it up.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.402
I'll take care of this. You
find Wrong Way while I get set.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.838
[Skipper groaning]

08:26.906 --> 08:28.639
There he is,
  something's wrong with him.

08:28.708 --> 08:32.110
- Where does it hurt?
    - Right here, Wrong Way.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.113
It might be your appendix
or you've eaten wild radishes.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.148
I think it's
         my appendix, Wrong Way.

08:37.217 --> 08:40.051
- He needs a doctor.
- Right, he needs an operation.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.886
- We have to get a doctor.
  - Not necessary, I'll do it.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.622
You can take out an appendix?

08:44.691 --> 08:46.657
Of course, under
    battlefield conditions.

08:46.726 --> 08:49.193
I've done it for my old friend,
Bucky Lorenzo.

08:49.262 --> 08:53.564
- But I think I need a doctor.
 - That's what Bucky said too.

08:53.633 --> 08:55.867
But it come out beautifully.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.869
Of course, I did make
  the incision a little too long

08:58.938 --> 09:00.605
but that didn't
               bother Old Bucky.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.074
He just wore his bathing suit
a little higher up.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.609
I feel great. You won't
   have to operate after all.

09:05.678 --> 09:08.747
They all say that.
Hold him down, Gilligan.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.515
What are you doing?

09:10.584 --> 09:12.116
You'll be alright.
              Take it easy.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.185
Idiot, there's nothing
wrong with me.

09:14.254 --> 09:17.855
Oh, yeah. We have
         to get you out of here.

09:17.924 --> 09:20.224
Alright, Gilligan, I'll be back.
I gotta burn these instruments.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.226
How can you operate
         without any anesthetic?

09:22.295 --> 09:25.597
I'll do what I did for Bucky.
 Hit him with a monkey wrench.

09:25.665 --> 09:27.631
Oh, but, Wrong Way.
You won't have to.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.900
See, I feel great.
Look, I'm dancing.

09:29.969 --> 09:33.772
- Delirious, already.
     - I can run too. See?

09:34.607 --> 09:35.806
I guess, now's the time.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.709
[Skipper screaming]

09:39.579 --> 09:42.280
Maybe it was
the wild radishes, after all.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.884
- How do you feel?
       - Fine.

09:52.526 --> 09:56.026
Make this look good, Gilligan.
  It might be our last chance.

09:56.095 --> 09:59.030
- I'll do my best.
    - Remember the symptoms.

09:59.098 --> 10:03.034
You've gotta make him think
that you've got Bola Bola Fever.

10:03.102 --> 10:07.371
Dry mouth, stomach ache,
        dizziness, ringing ears

10:07.440 --> 10:08.907
and sore head.

10:08.975 --> 10:11.676
Oh, yeah. I hope
it'll look bad enough.

10:11.744 --> 10:14.645
Don't worry, Gilligan.
          Just be yourself.

10:14.714 --> 10:16.681
[Wrong Way shouting]
      'Mary Ann!'

10:18.217 --> 10:22.520
Mary Ann, you've got any
  of that fried coconut left?

10:22.588 --> 10:25.357
- Get going.
          - Yes, sir.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.833
[wheezing heavily]

10:37.437 --> 10:39.537
Gilligan, what is it?

10:39.606 --> 10:41.373
[continues wheezing]

10:41.441 --> 10:44.175
What's wrong?

10:44.243 --> 10:46.945
I got a dry mouth,
              stomach ache

10:47.013 --> 10:48.879
dizziness, ringing ears
         and a sore head.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.882
Gilligan, little buddy. You look
awful. What's the matter?

10:51.951 --> 10:53.718
I got a dry mouth..

10:53.787 --> 10:54.885
[whispering]
          You know.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.687
He's been staggering along..

10:56.756 --> 10:58.923
What do you think, Wrong Way?

10:58.992 --> 11:02.260
Could be Jungle Fever,
     then it..

11:02.328 --> 11:04.228
[Gilligan laughing
       and moaning]

11:04.297 --> 11:06.197
- Really hurts?
     - O-oh, bad. Real bad.

11:06.265 --> 11:08.232
- I don't believe it.
     - Fever?

11:08.301 --> 11:10.935
No, it's another appendicitis.
You better get my Monkey wrench.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.304
Oh, no. I think
        you're wrong, Wrong Way.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.107
- He's hot.
     - Oh, I'm burning up.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.309
- I'm on fire, fire.
    - It's Bola Bola fever.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.378
I thought it's Bola Bola fever
but he don't have the symptoms.

11:21.447 --> 11:23.681
He doesn't? What are some
       of the other ones?

11:23.750 --> 11:26.517
Well, faintin' spells for..

11:26.586 --> 11:27.851
It's serious, Wrong Way.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.921
No, it's not as serious,
it's probably just

11:29.989 --> 11:31.589
a 24-hour Bola Bola.

11:31.658 --> 11:32.990
How do you know?

11:33.059 --> 11:35.727
Because with a serious Bola Bola
you get nosebleeds.

11:35.795 --> 11:38.096
We'll be right back.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.799
No, no, no, that's tropical
Bola Bola fever!

11:41.868 --> 11:45.069
No, with the Bola Bola,
you just have the fainting!

11:45.138 --> 11:47.204
He's getting worse.
He needs help.

11:47.273 --> 11:50.375
You're right, maybe the
  professor can fix him up, huh?

11:50.444 --> 11:53.844
Wrong Way,
he needs a doctor.

11:53.913 --> 11:56.580
Well, that would mean
           going back to Hawaii.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.950
I'll have to think that over.

11:59.018 --> 12:01.152
Going back to Hawaii?

12:06.125 --> 12:08.359
Skipper, if I see Wrong Way,
do I have to faint again?

12:08.428 --> 12:10.061
No, you did it
               enough yesterday.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.196
We haven't convinced him
        by now, it's no use.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.265
Good. I hate to faint. It hurts
when you hit the ground.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.968
- Good morning.
   - Good Morning, Mary Ann.

12:17.036 --> 12:18.803
Where is Wrong Way?
      Isn't he having breakfast?

12:18.872 --> 12:20.071
He's probably asleep.

12:20.139 --> 12:22.573
I went to wake him
            and he wasn't there.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.308
Maybe he's down
        at the lagoon.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.477
Your coffee will
           be ready in a minute.

12:26.546 --> 12:27.979
(Professor)
          'Hey.'

12:29.181 --> 12:31.482
Gilligan. Everybody.
      He's gone.

12:31.551 --> 12:32.717
Who's gone?

12:32.786 --> 12:34.485
Wrong Way.
          He's gone to get help.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.587
- It worked! It worked!
 - What's all this excitement?

12:36.656 --> 12:39.758
It's Wrong Way. I found this
 note at the clearing. Listen.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.793
"Being a man of conscience
   and principle

12:41.861 --> 12:43.928
I found myself faced
      with a difficult--"

12:43.997 --> 12:47.598
Never mind the memoirs.
      Get to the important part.

12:47.667 --> 12:51.669
"And so I decided Gilligan's
  life is more important

12:51.738 --> 12:53.203
"than my selfish needs.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.205
"Thus I have gone
       to the mainland.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.275
"It's a far, far
       better thing I do.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.743
Be right back."

12:58.811 --> 13:00.945
Oh! Thurston,
    we're gonna be rescued.

13:01.014 --> 13:05.483
Yes, unless he's gone the wrong
 way again. It is a possibility.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.894
I wonder what's
             taking him so long.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.829
Hope he can find Hawaii.

13:18.898 --> 13:20.297
I wonder if they'll send
a boat or a plane.

13:20.366 --> 13:22.800
Where he landed, they'll
        probably send a kayak.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.402
You know the first thing
I do when I get back

13:24.470 --> 13:27.571
I'm going to have
a thick juicy steak!

13:27.640 --> 13:30.441
I can't wait to see my mother.
I've never been gone this long.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.809
Me too.

13:31.878 --> 13:35.513
I can't wait to see my name up
in lights, Ginger Googenheimer.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.014
Isn't you name, Ginger Grant?

13:37.083 --> 13:38.716
Yeah. But if my name's
gonna be in lights

13:38.785 --> 13:42.187
I want as many lights
as I can get.

13:42.255 --> 13:46.457
Oh. I think I'll have
a nice ice cold beer, too.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.460
I just wanna sleep
             in a nice soft bed.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.894
What are you
           gonna do, Mr. Howell?

13:50.963 --> 13:53.398
- Double the rent.
       - Oh, Thurston.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.700
- Is that wrong, Lovey?
    - Well, Of course it is.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.569
Triple the rent.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.373
[propeller running]

14:05.511 --> 14:07.445
[indistinct chatter]

14:19.358 --> 14:22.393
Hey, Wrong Way.
       You made it back.

14:22.461 --> 14:25.496
- Mission accomplished.
    - You did it, Wrong Way.

14:25.565 --> 14:26.631
Please! Please!

14:26.699 --> 14:28.966
Being a man of conscience
   and principle

14:29.034 --> 14:30.634
I found myself faced--

14:30.703 --> 14:34.239
What is that? Your graduation
speech? We've heard that before.

14:36.108 --> 14:38.576
Here you are, Gilligan.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.579
- What is it?
     - The Bola Bola serum.

14:41.647 --> 14:43.847
But what about a doctor?
  Isn't someone following you?

14:43.916 --> 14:45.416
Certainly not!

14:45.485 --> 14:47.418
I had a hard time gettin'
  that without bein' noticed.

14:47.487 --> 14:51.021
- You didn't contact anyone?
  - And give up our privacy?

14:51.090 --> 14:53.024
You're lucky nobody
      seen me leave.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.159
I had to take off behind
    a pack of pelicans.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.463
- Nobody knows we're here?
   - Not from me.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.064
[moaning]

15:01.567 --> 15:03.801
Fainted, huh?

15:03.869 --> 15:07.672
It's a good thing I got back
in time. Looks like an epidemic.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.743
- See anything, Professor?
   - No, not yet.

15:12.812 --> 15:15.246
We should keep looking. Somebody
might have followed him.

15:15.314 --> 15:17.315
Here, I'll take over
for a while.

15:17.383 --> 15:19.784
I was sure Wrong Way was gonna
come back with a doctor.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.620
That state of mind, he should've
brought back a psychiatrist.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.889
- Hey, there's Wrong Way.
   - 'Wonderful.'

15:24.958 --> 15:26.890
'He's leaning up
      against the trees.'

15:26.959 --> 15:29.893
(Professor)
 'Well, I guess he's got what
 he wants. Peace and serenity.'

15:29.962 --> 15:31.795
What I wouldn't give
            for a little <i> noise!</i>

15:31.864 --> 15:34.465
Me, too. I miss all the shoving
and shouting and pushing.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.200
I could use a little
of that myself.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.869
Saturday night at the library,
 the hustle and bustle

15:38.938 --> 15:40.504
at the reference desks.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.207
You'd give Wrong Way a little
 hustle-bustle. Shake him up.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.342
What if we did give Wrong Way
 a little hustle-bustle?

15:45.411 --> 15:47.345
He'd get so mad,
     he'd leave the island.

15:47.414 --> 15:50.648
That's it! We'll give him what
 he's been complaining about.

15:50.716 --> 15:53.184
We'll make this island twice
  as bad as civilization.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.687
- He'd sure be glad to get out.
- Right!

16:00.459 --> 16:02.427
[banging]

16:08.334 --> 16:10.001
[banging continues]

16:17.777 --> 16:19.644
[sawing]

16:25.685 --> 16:28.019
(Wrong Way)
     What's goin' on here?

16:29.054 --> 16:31.088
Well, everybody up.
It's time to work.

16:31.157 --> 16:34.057
- Work?
 - Certainly. Didn't you know?

16:34.126 --> 16:36.327
- We're trying to build a city.
- A city?

16:36.395 --> 16:39.664
- Sure, just like back home.
- Yeah, we gotta get civilized.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.900
Fine. You folks get civilized.
 I'm goin' back to bed.

16:42.968 --> 16:45.335
Just a minute, Wrong Way.
Not so fast.

16:45.404 --> 16:47.238
You take this sledge,
get over there

16:47.307 --> 16:49.507
and start driving
those stakes in.

16:49.575 --> 16:50.908
[grunts]
            Why me?

16:50.977 --> 16:53.911
- Everyone does his part.
   - Wh-what's your part?

16:53.980 --> 16:57.448
My part is to see that you do
 your part. I'm the foreman.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.051
Now, start driving that
    stake in the ground.

17:17.403 --> 17:19.537
You better hurry up
with the clay.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.806
The Professor's waiting
         to bake the bread.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.142
This is the first time I've ever
been in a six-day clay ride.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.743
[siren hooting]

17:26.813 --> 17:28.244
- What's that?
        - Coffee break.

17:28.314 --> 17:31.782
- Ah, thank goodness.
  - Don't stop.The clay's hot.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.884
How am I gonna drink my coffee?

17:33.953 --> 17:37.522
I'll get it for you.
            Don't slow down.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.224
- Lay it hard.
         - 'Yeah.'

17:44.196 --> 17:46.264
Here you are.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.901
Umm! That's awful.
What is that?

17:50.970 --> 17:52.937
- It's coffee!
         - It's coffee?

17:53.005 --> 17:54.771
Oh, we make it
                  from fish.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.375
I mean, the instant's not
   as good as the regular, but..

17:57.443 --> 18:00.545
No, I don't want anymore.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.113
Skipper, he's ready.

18:03.182 --> 18:08.152
A little cream cheese on a roll?
A prune bagel?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.555
Well, come one. Don't stop
pumping, Wrong Way.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.392
There's lots more clay
where this came from.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.364
Pump! That's it, pump!

18:22.702 --> 18:25.703
Okay, Wrong Way. You work here
 for a while on the freeway.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.005
Freeway? What do we need
a freeway for?

18:28.074 --> 18:30.341
We don't even have
              one single car.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.810
Well, we can't let everything
 go to the last minute.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.045
He's in charge.
See you later.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.580
Oh, you're the new man, eh?

18:36.649 --> 18:38.615
I ain't never done
              this kind of work.

18:38.684 --> 18:41.352
You'll adore it, getting down
to Mother Earth.

18:41.420 --> 18:44.788
There's nothing like feeling
dirt against your opera gloves.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.090
Freeway?

18:46.159 --> 18:48.459
How else are we gonna get
to the music center?

18:48.528 --> 18:50.194
Not to mention the art museum
 and the city hall.

18:50.263 --> 18:53.264
It's part of our
    slum clearance project.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.000
- Oh!
 - Oh, darling. How marvelous.

18:57.069 --> 19:01.405
We haven't finished the freeway,
we've had our first accident.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.341
Just don't stand there.
Get to work.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.744
- You've got an axe.
- Yes, you've to work over here.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.346
And when you've finished
    chopping that tree down

19:09.415 --> 19:12.350
there's 15 more,
    just like it over there.

19:21.927 --> 19:24.362
Well, how'd it go, Wrong Way?
Are you finished?

19:24.430 --> 19:26.330
Just about.
              What's for supper?

19:26.399 --> 19:30.568
Oh, soup and salad

19:30.636 --> 19:32.169
fish, oh, yes.

19:32.238 --> 19:35.172
And Ginger made one of her
delicious desserts.

19:35.241 --> 19:36.773
Oh, great, 'cause
             I'm almost starved.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.810
- Oh, too bad you missed it.
  - Hmm?

19:51.624 --> 19:53.257
[sobbing]

20:00.265 --> 20:03.934
- Who's that?
    - Tired, huh, Wrong Way?

20:04.003 --> 20:06.303
Whatever gave you that idea.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.806
There's one thing that's so nice
about the islands.

20:08.875 --> 20:09.840
Peace and quiet.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.375
No traffic noises
       to wake you up.

20:12.444 --> 20:13.677
No noisy neighbors.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.346
Can't you two shut up
    and get a little sleep?

20:16.415 --> 20:18.782
- Goodnight, Wrong Way.
    - Ah, yeah.

20:18.851 --> 20:21.318
Goodnight, Wrong Way.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.288
- I said goodnight!
     - Goodnight, already.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.790
Skipper, do you mind if I read?

20:25.858 --> 20:28.659
- No, not at all.
  - How about you, Wrong Way?

20:28.727 --> 20:30.661
[mumbling]

20:38.070 --> 20:40.238
So nice and quiet.

20:46.645 --> 20:48.912
Hey, what is this,
     a hut or a lighthouse?

20:48.981 --> 20:51.249
Don't wanna ruin my eyes.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.952
See, Reggie stood
       at the doorway

20:55.021 --> 20:57.287
his finger on the trigger
   of the stub-nosed 38.

20:57.356 --> 20:59.556
His eyes were transfixed..

20:59.625 --> 21:02.960
Hey, Skipper, what does
    this mean here?

21:03.029 --> 21:05.329
- 'What?'
           - 'Here.'

21:05.398 --> 21:07.030
Do you mind?

21:07.099 --> 21:08.632
I'm not sure, Gilligan.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.869
Please, I gotta get some sleep.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.338
Alright, Gilligan.
Turn off the light.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.184
[crunching]

21:27.253 --> 21:31.354
- What was that? An earthquake?
- Just an apple, you want one?

21:31.423 --> 21:33.190
Hey, you got any
carrots over there?

21:33.258 --> 21:35.726
- No, I got some celery.
    - Okay.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.831
[crunching]

21:40.900 --> 21:45.669
Eat a nice, quiet banana.
   Get some sleep.

21:45.738 --> 21:48.806
Oh, Wrong Way. You can sleep
late tomorrow morning.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.242
- I can?
  - Sure. Tomorrow's Saturday.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.211
Oh, that's wonderful.
 Wonderful. Thank you, Skipper.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.547
Thank you. I can sleep,
    I can sleep.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.084
[crunching]

22:02.054 --> 22:04.121
- What's the matter?
      - I'm too excited.

22:04.190 --> 22:05.790
I can't sleep.

22:07.693 --> 22:10.027
- Where is he now?
- He's probably at the lagoon.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.262
I haven't let him
      wash in three days.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.565
Well, I hope
        he's down there.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.700
He better break pretty soon,
or we will.

22:16.769 --> 22:19.269
I can't work anymore. I've got
  a good excuse tomorrow.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.105
I promised Lovey
            I'll give me a note.

22:21.174 --> 22:24.674
We've got to keep this up,
even at our own expense.

22:24.743 --> 22:26.610
[aircraft engine revving]

22:30.817 --> 22:34.084
- Isn't that Wrong Way's plane?
- Yes, it must be.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.119
Come on!

22:35.188 --> 22:37.121
[chattering]

22:46.265 --> 22:48.833
[aircraft engine revving]

22:48.901 --> 22:50.534
(Skipper)
         Happy flight!

22:59.044 --> 23:00.344
Well, there he goes.

23:00.413 --> 23:01.946
This time, I hope
       he tells somebody.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.381
Why shouldn't he?
No reason to keep it a secret.

23:04.450 --> 23:05.849
We don't have
a paradise anymore.

23:05.918 --> 23:09.019
Even if he doesn't tell anyone,
we'll still be rescued.

23:09.088 --> 23:09.987
- We will?
           - Sure.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.822
Skipper loaded it
            with maps and notes.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.024
Somebody's bound to find 'em.

23:15.995 --> 23:19.163
I didn't think we'd ever get off
this island, but this time

23:19.232 --> 23:21.632
it's in the bag. Even Wrong Way
can't mess it up.

23:21.701 --> 23:25.135
- It's too good to be true.
  - We're really going home.

23:25.204 --> 23:26.670
Oh that crazy, wonderful fool.

23:26.738 --> 23:30.373
I'll give him that oil well,
  even if it is a dry one.

23:30.442 --> 23:32.710
[aircraft engine revving]

23:35.781 --> 23:38.015
Good luck, Wrong Way.

23:43.822 --> 23:45.789
Anybody want anything to eat?

23:45.858 --> 23:48.392
We should've heard something by
now. He's been gone three days.

23:48.461 --> 23:50.894
I'm afraid there's always the
possibility he could've crashed.

23:50.963 --> 23:53.764
Yes, I thought about that, but
 I was afraid to say anything.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.400
- Oh, no. He couldn't have.
  - Don't worry, dear.

23:56.468 --> 23:59.002
He's probably covered.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.804
- Sure at least he tried.
   - Oh, yes.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.840
We have to give him
      credit for trying.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.208
Hey, Skipper. Skipper, Skipper.

24:04.277 --> 24:06.643
There's a note from Wrong Way.
 In a bottle.

24:06.712 --> 24:09.814
- Found it down at the beach.
 - Let me see that.

24:11.984 --> 24:15.419
"I charted my course
 for Honolulu, but oddly enough

24:15.488 --> 24:18.755
"I lost my bearings
    when I flew into the eye

24:18.824 --> 24:21.091
"of a violent cloud.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.995
'"Somehow, I landed on
  a beautiful tropical island'

24:25.064 --> 24:28.999
'"and then finally found the
paradise I was looking for."'

24:30.669 --> 24:33.203
'"Although I'm probably
    not as happy as you are'

24:33.272 --> 24:35.238
'"it's good enough for me.'

24:35.307 --> 24:39.309
'"Maybe next time,
   I'll make it to Honolulu.'

24:39.378 --> 24:42.879
Best wishes,
         W.W. Feldman."

24:42.948 --> 24:46.350
Well, that's it.
     Left us high and dry.

24:46.419 --> 24:48.652
- Skipper, we got more trouble.
- What?

24:48.721 --> 24:51.922
It says, "Return the empty."

25:02.168 --> 25:03.567
¶ Now this is the tale
     of our castaways ¶

25:03.636 --> 25:05.669
¶ They're here
    for a long, long time ¶

25:05.738 --> 25:08.171
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

25:08.240 --> 25:09.940
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:10.009 --> 25:12.342
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

25:12.411 --> 25:14.211
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:14.279 --> 25:16.479
¶ To make the others
      comfortable ¶

25:16.548 --> 25:18.715
¶ In the tropic island nest ¶

25:18.784 --> 25:20.850
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motorcar ¶

25:20.919 --> 25:22.886
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:22.955 --> 25:25.322
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:25.390 --> 25:27.124
¶ As primitive as can be ¶

25:27.192 --> 25:29.592
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:29.661 --> 25:31.896
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:31.964 --> 25:34.031
¶ From seven
      stranded castaways ¶

25:34.100 --> 25:36.267
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶
