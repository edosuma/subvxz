WEBVTT

00:01.826 --> 00:03.260
Previously on Ascension...

00:03.294 --> 00:06.230
As far as the crew believes they're
halfway through a 100-year journey.

00:06.264 --> 00:08.765
- And one of them is a murderer.
- I don't think Stokes did it.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.968
What if the saboteurs have been
around longer than we've suspected?

00:11.002 --> 00:14.004
If Lorelei made the same
connection, it might be why she died.

00:14.038 --> 00:16.740
You have someone inside Ascension.

00:16.789 --> 00:19.409
You have a wild imagination.

00:20.344 --> 00:22.211
Sex is the true currency here on the ship.

00:22.245 --> 00:24.623
Don't undermine me with my girls, Will.

00:24.648 --> 00:28.015
- And Rose?
- He got to someone in your inner circle.

00:28.051 --> 00:29.518
Can you uncover his spy?

00:29.553 --> 00:31.954
Your life and the life of this project

00:31.988 --> 00:33.322
have the same expectancy.

00:33.357 --> 00:35.472
I'm not just there to
investigate a murder, am I?

00:35.497 --> 00:38.232
He's hiding something and the
TC Group wants to know what that is.

00:38.257 --> 00:39.691
Experiments?

00:39.716 --> 00:41.255
She's what we've been working towards,
isn't she?

00:41.272 --> 00:44.688
- She's the best chance we have.
- I'm scared.

00:45.100 --> 00:47.936
This whole project is one
big lie told to 600 people.

00:47.961 --> 00:50.997
I can get tissue samples from the living
relatives, we can test the DNA.

00:51.022 --> 00:52.631
There's no way that I can get to them.

00:52.656 --> 00:55.437
LET ME OUT!

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:06.215 --> 01:08.850
Excuse me!

01:08.885 --> 01:10.752
I didn't think it would be possible

01:10.786 --> 01:13.055
to top last year's Ostara,
but you have done it.

01:14.090 --> 01:16.239
So many eager faces.

01:16.264 --> 01:18.514
They spend the year hoping
and praying they'll be chosen

01:18.539 --> 01:19.689
to have a child.

01:19.714 --> 01:21.848
Tonight they find out
if they won the lottery.

01:21.873 --> 01:24.508
Those who aren't chosen,
you think they'll blame you?

01:24.533 --> 01:26.201
There's always a few who feel

01:26.226 --> 01:28.228
like I have some influence
over the birth list.

01:28.253 --> 01:30.754
All I really do is keep
the alcohol flowing.

01:31.908 --> 01:33.842
What about us?

01:33.876 --> 01:37.145
Do you ever regret not having a legacy?

01:37.180 --> 01:40.849
Do we have to have this
discussion again, William?

01:40.883 --> 01:43.719
Yeah, we wouldn't want
to talk about anything

01:43.753 --> 01:45.664
that's simmering beneath the surface.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.823
I'm content. You're the one with regrets.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.524
Mm-hmm.

01:49.908 --> 01:51.709
Thank you.

01:59.056 --> 02:03.392
So, what is this, some
kind of fertility festival?

02:03.417 --> 02:05.008
Essentially. It's Ostara.

02:05.042 --> 02:09.120
It's a completely unique
cultural phenomenon.

02:09.145 --> 02:11.012
It evolved into what it became now

02:11.047 --> 02:13.939
out of the necessity for keeping
the ship's population static.

02:13.964 --> 02:16.002
Everything on the ship
is geared to this moment,

02:16.027 --> 02:18.195
finding out who the birth computer chose.

02:18.346 --> 02:21.315
- With a little help.
- I don't make the selections.

02:21.662 --> 02:23.763
Before couples are allowed to be married,

02:23.788 --> 02:24.989
they submit their profiles

02:25.014 --> 02:26.873
and find out their
chances of being selected.

02:26.898 --> 02:30.601
That makes it pretty easy to kill off
any pairings that you don't like.

02:31.054 --> 02:33.856
The integrity of the experiment depends

02:33.881 --> 02:35.749
on non-interference.

02:43.288 --> 02:46.175
What is it? What are
you waiting for, Gault?

02:46.200 --> 02:47.591
If I were single,

02:47.616 --> 02:50.051
I'd be doing a damn site
more than just watching.

02:50.092 --> 02:52.637
You put your name in for marriage approval?

02:52.662 --> 02:54.729
Every year for the last 3 years straight.

02:54.754 --> 02:57.222
- Ah, don't lose faith.
You're a high-value male.

02:57.772 --> 02:59.506
An officer.

02:59.531 --> 03:02.232
It's just a matter of
finding you the right match.

03:02.598 --> 03:03.564
Ma'am!

03:03.589 --> 03:08.102
Do your captain a favour. Make
sure the XO enjoys himself.

03:08.137 --> 03:09.885
To Ostara!

03:09.910 --> 03:11.144
Ostara!

03:11.169 --> 03:12.336
To Ostara.

03:49.669 --> 03:52.037
Mom!

03:53.589 --> 03:56.157
Hi, Christa.

03:56.496 --> 03:58.197
Do you hear that, Mom?

04:40.963 --> 04:42.130
Be honest.

04:42.164 --> 04:45.422
Who rigs the birth list,
Viondra or your dad?

04:45.422 --> 04:49.241
It isn't rigged, but it's
not a true lottery, either.

04:49.241 --> 04:50.471
Come here!

04:51.243 --> 04:54.271
It's weighted to take into
account genetic variance

04:54.271 --> 04:55.571
in a small gene pool.

04:55.606 --> 04:56.904
Think about it.

04:56.904 --> 04:59.138
We only have 600 people...

05:02.176 --> 05:03.709
to make billions.

05:03.744 --> 05:06.646
So there's a chance, then, for you and me.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.115
Depends what the computer decides.

05:09.149 --> 05:11.517
It's kind of romantic,
if you think about it.

05:11.552 --> 05:14.453
One match out of hundreds.

05:14.488 --> 05:16.889
It's a machine that
decides our lives for us.

05:16.924 --> 05:18.767
There's nothing romantic about that.

05:22.203 --> 05:24.070
Come on.

05:24.098 --> 05:26.499
I don't want to miss the dancing.

05:35.209 --> 05:37.685
Can you believe she's
actually wearing a crown?

05:39.046 --> 05:40.613
She thinks she's royalty.

05:40.648 --> 05:43.516
No, it's not a crown.
It's a fertility wreath!

05:43.551 --> 05:46.452
It seems wrong that someone who
opted out of the birth list

05:46.487 --> 05:47.455
should preside over it.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.147
Yeah, that's actually a necessity.

05:49.172 --> 05:52.641
It would be such a temptation
to put yourself on the list.

05:52.666 --> 05:55.147
Ah, you're too young to remember,

05:55.172 --> 05:56.847
but just a dozen years ago,

05:56.872 --> 06:00.009
the selection was the
most tense day on the ship.

06:00.034 --> 06:02.135
Now it's a party!

06:02.169 --> 06:04.871
Welcome to Ostara!

06:04.905 --> 06:07.841
To Ostara!

06:07.875 --> 06:11.945
The originals knew a
journey of this magnitude

06:11.979 --> 06:14.614
comes with great sacrifice.

06:14.648 --> 06:19.400
Our lives and laws are governed
by a different set of needs.

06:19.425 --> 06:24.667
Our ancestors could fall in
love, marry and have children

06:24.692 --> 06:26.059
as fate would allow.

06:26.093 --> 06:29.629
But we have a bigger responsibility:

06:29.663 --> 06:33.074
to ensure the survival of the human race.

06:56.380 --> 06:58.014
Lorelei?

07:04.064 --> 07:08.968
For us, death and life are
intrinsically intertwined.

07:09.002 --> 07:12.572
Without one, there cannot be the other.

07:12.597 --> 07:16.867
Let us pause and remember
those who are no longer with us.

07:19.103 --> 07:21.304
Ike Messmer, Medical,

07:22.082 --> 07:25.985
John Stokes, Stockyard Master,

07:26.019 --> 07:30.222
and Lorelei Wright, Archives.

07:30.256 --> 07:31.756
In their passing,

07:31.781 --> 07:36.194
they allow for the creation
of new life, of new hope.

07:46.773 --> 07:49.475
Lorelei, don't!

07:50.277 --> 07:53.246
Now for the moment you've been waiting for.

07:53.280 --> 07:57.014
The computer's selection was
sealed in this envelope, unseen.

07:58.585 --> 08:00.653
It is my honour to present...

08:00.687 --> 08:02.631
Deborah and Timothy Fermi.

08:02.656 --> 08:05.558
Whoo!

08:06.827 --> 08:09.295
Susan and Paul Carr.

08:12.796 --> 08:17.099
And the last name selected for
this year's birth list is...

08:17.124 --> 08:19.481
Emily and Duke Vanderhaus.

08:21.441 --> 08:23.743
Duke, I...

08:25.979 --> 08:29.081
Escort them to their sleeping pods.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.001
Lorelei, wait!

08:55.142 --> 08:57.110
Look away!

08:57.144 --> 08:59.395
Look away!

08:59.420 --> 09:02.488
Let me put on some music.

09:07.988 --> 09:09.655
I love it when you do that.

09:09.690 --> 09:11.991
What is this?

09:12.025 --> 09:14.527
What else do you like?

09:24.438 --> 09:27.006
Shut it off. Shut it off!

09:27.040 --> 09:29.675
Look away, Christa!

09:31.841 --> 09:34.075
LOOK AWAY!

09:42.818 --> 09:43.985
What's wrong?

09:45.254 --> 09:46.621
Christa!

09:46.655 --> 09:49.023
It's OK! Christa, it's OK!

09:52.955 --> 09:57.259
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

10:02.997 --> 10:05.632
Go back, before the tape starts.

10:07.541 --> 10:08.609
You see?

10:08.609 --> 10:10.643
She's reacting before the tape begins.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.245
She knew it was gonna happen,

10:13.024 --> 10:14.296
just like in the medical centre.

10:14.296 --> 10:15.234
And the milk!

10:15.234 --> 10:16.874
My father said morphic resonance

10:16.874 --> 10:18.762
would take a minimum of 3 generations,

10:18.762 --> 10:19.762
and he was right!

10:19.775 --> 10:20.809
She's the catalyst.

10:22.378 --> 10:25.580
Looks like things are getting
out of hand on your ship.

10:25.615 --> 10:26.848
It's Ostara.

10:27.314 --> 10:29.602
Everyone gets a little crazy.

10:29.602 --> 10:31.766
Christa is extremely unstable.

10:31.791 --> 10:34.370
You clearly haven't spent
much time with teenagers.

10:34.404 --> 10:36.040
They're volatile by definition.

10:36.065 --> 10:39.175
You sit here, and you watch
them day in and day out,

10:39.209 --> 10:41.474
but I think that you forget they're people.

10:41.499 --> 10:43.133
And you forget I've known Christa

10:43.158 --> 10:44.359
since the day she was born.

10:44.384 --> 10:46.018
I watched her take her first steps.

10:46.043 --> 10:48.945
And now you get to watch
the project's effect on her.

10:48.970 --> 10:51.137
I bet you're very proud.

10:58.911 --> 11:00.512
What does it do?

11:00.537 --> 11:03.505
Basically, it uses
magnets to look inside you.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.698
Robert's father built it a long time ago.

11:07.449 --> 11:08.799
Will it be able to help me?

11:08.824 --> 11:12.849
You know, part of what makes the
brain just so hard to understand

11:12.874 --> 11:14.686
is that we're stuck inside of it.

11:14.711 --> 11:16.378
We're just trying to figure it out.

11:16.419 --> 11:18.196
Like solving a maze from the inside.

11:18.221 --> 11:20.015
You still don't remember anything

11:20.040 --> 11:21.469
about the time when you were sick?

11:21.494 --> 11:22.928
I remember seeing Lorelei.

11:22.953 --> 11:24.054
Lorelei?

11:24.821 --> 11:26.538
You mean in a dream?

11:26.563 --> 11:28.464
At the party.

11:30.360 --> 11:34.030
Lorelei kept telling me to
look away, but I couldn't.

11:34.064 --> 11:37.266
Sometimes, this feeling, it comes over me.

11:38.383 --> 11:41.318
I don't know how to explain it.

11:41.343 --> 11:43.845
Try. I'd like to know.

11:44.107 --> 11:48.778
It feels like I'm holding back an ocean.

11:51.348 --> 11:53.767
Dammit, William! You
should've known better.

11:53.792 --> 11:56.227
How many times am I gonna have to tell you?

11:56.252 --> 11:59.164
I had no idea Lorelei was filming me.

11:59.189 --> 12:01.257
Half of power is perception,

12:01.291 --> 12:03.659
and thanks to your
stunning lack of restraint,

12:03.694 --> 12:06.187
everything that I have
worked for has come undone

12:06.212 --> 12:07.730
in one humiliating moment!

12:07.764 --> 12:09.265
It's gonna blow over.

12:09.299 --> 12:12.437
We're not gonna end up in
the lower decks anytime soon.

12:12.462 --> 12:15.566
Do you think all my
efforts to keep you seated,

12:15.591 --> 12:17.893
the negotiation, the favour-trading,

12:17.918 --> 12:19.751
my lunches with Rose,

12:19.776 --> 12:22.759
are because I'm afraid to
go back to the lower decks?

12:22.784 --> 12:25.924
I've been there, William!
It doesn't frighten me!

12:25.949 --> 12:28.827
It was your goddamn birth-list ceremony!

12:28.852 --> 12:31.220
I mean, how the hell
did that video get shown?

12:31.254 --> 12:34.757
I have no idea, but it's cost us dearly!

12:34.791 --> 12:39.528
Do you think I don't know
what people say about me,

12:39.563 --> 12:43.299
that I'm self-indulgent,
manipulative, a harpy?

12:43.509 --> 12:46.868
I'm not who people think I am, William.

12:46.893 --> 12:48.084
I'm not.

12:48.109 --> 12:51.350
If they knew the compromises
that I have made...

12:51.375 --> 12:54.377
That was the bargain
that we both entered into.

12:54.402 --> 12:57.170
You're the one that complicated it.

12:57.580 --> 13:00.749
Because I was foolish enough to love you,

13:00.784 --> 13:03.752
to think that we were in this together?

13:10.701 --> 13:13.336
And they meant nothing to me.

13:13.361 --> 13:14.828
You know that.

13:14.853 --> 13:17.319
None of them compare to you.

13:17.344 --> 13:20.079
I saw the way you looked at Lorelei.

13:20.649 --> 13:24.752
It's been years since I've
seen that look in your eyes.

13:24.777 --> 13:27.913
I'd almost forgotten
you were capable of it.

13:29.060 --> 13:31.228
I hope it was worth it.

13:38.563 --> 13:41.565
You know, you can drink
in the officer's lounge

13:41.590 --> 13:43.057
now that you're a cadet.

13:43.082 --> 13:45.150
It's not my favourite place right now.

13:47.664 --> 13:49.231
Of all the men on the ship,

13:49.265 --> 13:51.667
I never would've guessed
it was the captain.

13:52.936 --> 13:54.770
I'm sorry, James.

13:56.539 --> 13:58.357
I don't know what to say.

13:58.382 --> 14:01.610
Please don't.

14:01.644 --> 14:04.246
We're never gonna be matched, Nora.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.914
There's no point in starting this.

14:05.949 --> 14:08.634
- James!
- With Lorelei, I knew I didn't have a future.

14:08.659 --> 14:11.551
But with you, I fooled myself into
thinking that this was a possibility.

14:11.576 --> 14:13.744
It is! You just have to have
faith in the system.

14:13.899 --> 14:15.199
The system's rigged,

14:15.224 --> 14:17.325
and all the hoping in the
world won't change that.

14:17.350 --> 14:19.151
I refuse to believe that.

14:19.176 --> 14:20.376
It's the truth.

14:20.494 --> 14:23.283
So, until someone finds the courage

14:23.308 --> 14:25.455
to destroy the birth computer

14:25.480 --> 14:27.781
and change everything on this ship,

14:27.806 --> 14:30.341
we should stop seeing each other.

14:42.268 --> 14:43.869
You know, it's kind...

14:43.894 --> 14:45.482
Looks like someone lost a bet!

14:46.623 --> 14:49.825
Um, no, a couple of the
guys just had a wager

14:49.860 --> 14:53.229
about who'd get chosen for the birth list.

14:53.263 --> 14:56.641
That's a pretty steep challenge,

14:56.666 --> 14:59.868
trying to keep people from procreating.

14:59.902 --> 15:02.971
Kind of goes against human nature.

15:03.005 --> 15:06.325
How do they keep them
from getting knocked up?

15:06.350 --> 15:10.419
And fooling around seems to
be their number-one pastime.

15:10.444 --> 15:14.747
It's, um, subcutaneous
birth-control implants at puberty.

15:15.751 --> 15:18.620
And everyone just always follows the rules?

15:18.654 --> 15:19.995
Uh, no.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.612
No, uh, some people rebel.

15:22.637 --> 15:25.706
They try to circumvent the
system, rip out their implants.

15:25.731 --> 15:28.239
Their kids are called "unclaimed."

15:28.264 --> 15:30.270
The families are pretty much
at the bottom of the food chain.

15:30.295 --> 15:31.628
Total pariahs.

15:31.653 --> 15:34.421
And they knowingly put
themselves in that position?

15:34.446 --> 15:36.929
Well, some people are just hardwired

15:36.954 --> 15:38.221
to want to have families,

15:38.246 --> 15:40.313
regardless of whether or not they should.

15:40.338 --> 15:41.463
Should?

15:41.488 --> 15:44.323
Genetically speaking, of course.

15:44.348 --> 15:46.049
Of course.

15:50.668 --> 15:54.198
And what does Enzmann look
for, genetically speaking,

15:54.223 --> 15:56.424
when determining who makes the birth list?

15:56.459 --> 15:59.794
Oh, no, no, no! Harris
has nothing to do with it.

15:59.829 --> 16:01.629
It's purely a mathematic equation.

16:01.654 --> 16:03.889
Also known as old-school eugenics.

16:03.914 --> 16:06.544
Well, that's kind of a strong word.

16:06.569 --> 16:08.994
You're deciding who can
and cannot procreate.

16:09.019 --> 16:10.284
From where I stand,

16:10.309 --> 16:13.229
that makes social Darwinism
look like a walk in the park.

16:13.254 --> 16:15.556
You could've fired a warning shot!

16:16.472 --> 16:18.773
Warren told you she got my report?

16:18.798 --> 16:21.466
Yes, and she's on her way over here right now.

16:21.517 --> 16:25.467
I thought you were starting
to grasp what we're doing here,

16:25.492 --> 16:28.227
the impact it will have
on all of our futures.

16:28.252 --> 16:30.987
Oh, I do, and I think
that you've gone unchecked

16:31.012 --> 16:32.245
for far too long.

16:32.270 --> 16:34.704
You have no concept of
the damage you've done.

16:34.729 --> 16:36.296
You've cut me off at the knees!

16:36.321 --> 16:39.056
I don't work for you.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.882
I work for her.

16:50.278 --> 16:52.480
You're working out your frustrations,

16:52.505 --> 16:54.671
or are you just avoiding your lovely wife?

16:54.696 --> 16:56.730
I'd imagine she's none too pleased with you!

16:57.227 --> 16:59.395
My marriage is none of your business,
Councilman Davis.

16:59.420 --> 17:02.022
Seems you've made it the business
of everyone on this ship.

17:02.047 --> 17:05.215
That was some show you put on.
I was on the edge of my seat!

17:05.241 --> 17:07.078
I couldn't wait to see
what would happen next.

17:07.103 --> 17:09.771
Nothing stands in the way
of my duty to the ship.

17:10.048 --> 17:11.815
You'd be wise to remember that.

17:11.839 --> 17:14.008
Looks like I've overstayed my welcome.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.400
Captain.

17:15.891 --> 17:18.326
Rose, I'll see you in Chambers.

17:22.011 --> 17:23.605
Is something funny?

17:23.630 --> 17:27.700
You have no idea how
powerless you really are.

17:27.724 --> 17:29.200
What do you want, Rose?

17:29.225 --> 17:32.179
I want you to step down
as captain, Denninger.

17:32.204 --> 17:33.538
Ha! Never.

17:33.848 --> 17:35.878
Fine! Very well.

17:35.903 --> 17:38.827
I prefer the public humiliation anyway.

17:38.862 --> 17:41.964
Your movie swayed Councilman
Davis to see things my way.

17:41.998 --> 17:44.333
Now I have a clear majority.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.925
I'm gonna make you beg in
front of the whole ship.

17:46.950 --> 17:50.853
It's been a while since I've
seen a Denninger on their knees,

17:50.878 --> 17:53.713
but tell your wife I send my regards.

17:58.648 --> 18:00.215
What's going on?

18:02.719 --> 18:04.720
Sir! Sir!

18:10.093 --> 18:12.561
Sir, that's enough! Stop!

18:12.595 --> 18:15.964
- Sir!
- Councilman!

18:15.999 --> 18:17.933
- Please!
- Sir!

18:19.102 --> 18:22.104
You're done, Denninger! Done!

18:23.273 --> 18:25.374
Let go!

18:25.408 --> 18:27.676
Get off of me! I'm fine.

18:46.462 --> 18:48.428
Time for your happy pills, Stokes.

18:48.465 --> 18:49.665
You know the drill.

18:51.768 --> 18:53.536
I need to go to the can.

18:53.570 --> 18:54.737
Pills first!

19:45.849 --> 19:47.626
I've left room for your comments.

19:49.414 --> 19:52.309
You cannot send this report up the chain.

19:52.334 --> 19:55.795
- Perhaps you forget our respective ranks here.
- Seriously, Katherine...

19:55.820 --> 19:58.084
If this is a plea based
on personal friendship...

19:58.109 --> 19:59.356
Friendship, my ass!

19:59.973 --> 20:01.707
From the beginning, you've seen this

20:01.732 --> 20:04.134
as a stepping stone to
power in and of itself.

20:04.159 --> 20:06.696
It means nothing to you.
That's why you need me.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.514
Only someone who lives and breathes

20:08.549 --> 20:11.651
and devotes his life, his
health, his sanity to this job

20:11.685 --> 20:13.419
has any chance of pulling it off.

20:13.454 --> 20:16.260
So, you're the only smart,
motivated person on the planet?

20:16.285 --> 20:18.628
I'm not irreplaceable because I'm smart.

20:18.653 --> 20:21.154
I'm irreplaceable because I'm obsessed!

20:21.639 --> 20:24.707
Do you know how we met, your father and I?

20:24.732 --> 20:28.444
It was at Nellis. I was part
of the president's advance team.

20:28.871 --> 20:30.005
And when we arrived,

20:30.030 --> 20:32.038
we found your father working on the tarmac,

20:32.072 --> 20:33.439
covered in grease and dirt,

20:33.474 --> 20:36.042
up to his elbows in one
of his prototype engines.

20:36.076 --> 20:38.878
He was threatening to murder
every airman on the base

20:38.912 --> 20:41.280
if he didn't get a
socket wrench that moment.

20:41.315 --> 20:45.885
But, evidently, the same design
had exploded a few days before.

20:45.919 --> 20:48.200
And I grabbed that wrench,
and I marched up to him

20:48.225 --> 20:50.193
and introduced myself to your father.

20:50.218 --> 20:51.952
And he hired me on the spot.

20:52.392 --> 20:56.129
You quit a job with the
president to work for my father?

20:56.163 --> 20:57.454
Yes.

20:57.479 --> 21:00.375
He had a way of making
other men, even great men,

21:00.400 --> 21:03.136
seem ordinary when they stood beside him.

21:05.272 --> 21:08.908
I didn't take this job for power.

21:08.942 --> 21:11.911
I took it because it means something to me.

21:11.945 --> 21:13.746
And I am questioning

21:13.781 --> 21:16.382
whether you're the right
person to drive this ship.

21:20.663 --> 21:21.997
Yeah.

21:22.022 --> 21:24.490
We got a problem. Stokes is gone.

21:24.691 --> 21:30.195
Nine, together. Ten, and done!

21:39.439 --> 21:42.341
I heard Lorelei was pregnant when she died.

21:42.376 --> 21:45.178
You shouldn't believe everything you hear.

21:45.212 --> 21:47.313
Report back to the stewardess dorms.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.948
Prepare for a full inspection.

21:50.217 --> 21:51.717
Now!

22:30.558 --> 22:32.692
Don't worry. No one saw me.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.161
I was careful.

22:35.195 --> 22:37.263
That wasn't smart.

22:37.298 --> 22:39.365
I'm under a lot of scrutiny.

22:40.456 --> 22:42.724
It sounds like you need to relax.

22:42.749 --> 22:45.284
No, what I need is to find out...

22:46.206 --> 22:50.743
Look, what I need is to find
out who uploaded that video.

22:50.778 --> 22:54.447
There's only one person it could've been.

22:54.781 --> 22:56.649
Your wife.

22:56.683 --> 23:00.987
What possible reason
would she have to do that?

23:01.021 --> 23:05.199
Hell hath no fury like
an older woman scorned.

23:05.224 --> 23:07.559
Don't underestimate experience.

23:07.593 --> 23:09.995
Can experience give you a child?

23:12.263 --> 23:15.299
I need something, a favour.

23:16.370 --> 23:18.471
Can I trust you?

23:18.496 --> 23:20.363
Anything.

23:24.577 --> 23:27.542
I need this delivered to the lower 40s.

23:27.567 --> 23:29.725
I can't do it myself.

23:29.750 --> 23:31.351
There are too many eyes on me.

23:31.851 --> 23:34.086
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you.

24:01.075 --> 24:04.511
S-sorry! I... I didn't
know you were down here.

24:39.619 --> 24:41.887
Hey!

24:41.921 --> 24:46.091
What deck are we on, huh?

24:46.126 --> 24:48.560
Where's the captain been hiding?

24:48.595 --> 24:52.006
I've never been on this
part of the ship before.

24:52.031 --> 24:54.151
We must be below Water Reclamation,

24:54.176 --> 24:55.577
near the pusher plate.

24:57.063 --> 25:00.833
I can't... I can't imagine
how this must be for you.

25:02.575 --> 25:05.844
I didn't kill that girl, all right?

25:05.878 --> 25:08.046
I will not rot down here forever.

25:08.081 --> 25:10.048
You can tell the captain that.

25:10.083 --> 25:13.218
I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.

25:14.661 --> 25:18.430
Then you take me to him,
and I'll tell him myself.

25:22.078 --> 25:24.213
You know I'm a butcher, right?

25:29.135 --> 25:30.836
I need to talk to you.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.273
Duke will be back soon.

25:35.216 --> 25:37.251
I'm looking for Lorelei's stenotab.

25:37.276 --> 25:38.246
Do you know where it is?

25:38.271 --> 25:41.034
All of her possessions were turned into
the Safety Office after the funeral.

25:41.059 --> 25:43.761
The stenotab was never logged in.

25:43.786 --> 25:45.754
Who did you turn it over to?

25:46.819 --> 25:48.453
Who do you think?

25:48.480 --> 25:50.881
Why are you acting this way?

25:51.332 --> 25:54.001
Aaron, you know what's between us is over.

25:54.026 --> 25:55.709
You can't find excuses to...

25:55.734 --> 25:57.546
Emily, you're the one
discussing our relationship,

25:57.571 --> 25:59.272
not me.

25:59.297 --> 26:02.366
I came to ask a question,
and I got an answer.

26:02.976 --> 26:04.777
Thank you.

26:05.900 --> 26:09.069
Oh, and congratulations on the birth list.

26:09.386 --> 26:11.153
You must be very happy.

26:15.691 --> 26:17.291
We're locked down.

26:17.316 --> 26:19.192
Security's looking for
him. He can't get far.

26:19.217 --> 26:22.786
Director Warren is talking
contingency plans, Carrillo.

26:22.811 --> 26:25.946
It's not just the project
that's at stake. It's us.

26:25.971 --> 26:28.173
Find Stokes.

26:45.785 --> 26:46.985
Who's that?

26:55.953 --> 26:58.622
I'm supposed to deliver this.

26:58.647 --> 27:00.181
From the captain.

27:10.870 --> 27:12.971
You're not getting enough rations.

27:13.005 --> 27:14.718
He's an unclaimed, isn't he?

27:14.743 --> 27:16.777
You should go.

27:21.105 --> 27:23.557
Take me to the bridge.
I wanna talk to Denninger.

27:23.582 --> 27:24.643
You've gotta believe me!

27:24.668 --> 27:25.988
He doesn't know any more than you do.

27:26.013 --> 27:27.747
No, you're lying! He framed me!

27:28.371 --> 27:30.372
I know that you didn't kill Lorelei.

27:30.397 --> 27:33.285
How do you know that, huh? Who are you?

27:35.414 --> 27:37.214
Safety officers!

27:40.032 --> 27:41.899
Sound the all clear.

27:55.624 --> 27:57.225
Why didn't you scream?

27:58.218 --> 28:00.352
I wanna help you.

28:00.676 --> 28:02.843
Why? What do you care?

28:08.789 --> 28:11.290
No, don't go in there, please! Please!

28:42.997 --> 28:44.798
Where?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.181
We're on Earth.

28:57.204 --> 29:01.140
That's impossible. We didn't turn around.

29:01.393 --> 29:03.261
You never left.

29:06.236 --> 29:10.906
No, we... we haven't
had contact in decades.

29:10.931 --> 29:13.152
No, this is some kind of trick!

29:13.177 --> 29:16.546
Stokes, listen to me! You never left Earth.

29:20.061 --> 29:22.696
I don't... I don't understand!

29:22.721 --> 29:24.322
I don't understand!

29:25.213 --> 29:28.822
They've been lying to you
since before you were born.

29:28.847 --> 29:31.549
They've lied to you about everything.

29:31.841 --> 29:33.642
We have to get out of here now.

29:35.143 --> 29:36.710
Stokes!

29:36.752 --> 29:38.586
We have to go now!

29:40.396 --> 29:42.063
We have to go!

29:54.546 --> 29:56.343
How's she doing?

29:56.368 --> 29:58.002
She suffered intense trauma,

29:58.027 --> 30:00.829
and her brain may have
forged some faulty pathways

30:00.854 --> 30:02.155
to avoid dealing with it.

30:02.571 --> 30:05.807
- She's been through a lot.
- Yeah.

30:05.841 --> 30:08.327
That video that was shown during Ostara,

30:08.352 --> 30:11.841
can you track the access code
that was used to upload it?

30:11.866 --> 30:14.601
The subvid data woven into each file,

30:15.079 --> 30:18.242
it should track the codes.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.936
So, it looks like this was broadcast

30:22.961 --> 30:25.496
from a terminal on Deck 13.

30:25.521 --> 30:27.422
Let me put on some music.

30:27.447 --> 30:29.648
Section C. Wait a minute.

30:29.673 --> 30:31.140
That doesn't make any sense.

30:31.165 --> 30:32.274
What is it?

30:32.299 --> 30:35.468
That's the captain's access code.

30:36.105 --> 30:39.449
That's impossible! The
captain didn't upload it.

30:39.474 --> 30:42.084
Well, then, someone who had his code did.

30:42.109 --> 30:44.610
I love it when you do that.

30:46.086 --> 30:48.354
Christa!

30:48.953 --> 30:51.622
Christa!

31:00.095 --> 31:02.330
Hi! What are you doing home?

31:02.364 --> 31:06.567
I got off work early to
have my implant removed.

31:08.704 --> 31:12.073
I still can't believe this is happening.

31:16.245 --> 31:18.179
What's wrong?

31:18.213 --> 31:22.550
Gault came by to ask
about Lorelei's stenotab.

31:23.785 --> 31:25.019
Gault, here?

31:25.053 --> 31:27.355
And what did you tell him?

31:27.389 --> 31:29.590
That you took it to the Safety Office.

31:29.615 --> 31:31.627
He told me it was never logged in.

31:31.731 --> 31:32.698
Hmm...

31:32.928 --> 31:34.662
Duke, tell me the truth.

31:34.696 --> 31:37.398
It was stolen from the Safety Office.

31:37.432 --> 31:40.902
I didn't realize it was
missing until after Ostara.

31:41.527 --> 31:43.194
Why didn't you tell me?

31:43.238 --> 31:46.553
The better question is why did
Gault bypass the Safety Office

31:46.578 --> 31:49.465
and come to see my wife in our cabin?

31:50.078 --> 31:53.714
He probably thought I'd
forgotten to give it to you.

31:53.748 --> 31:56.177
I'm not a fool, Emily.

31:56.202 --> 31:58.904
Please don't treat me like one.

31:58.929 --> 32:01.364
I've seen the way he looks at you.

32:04.867 --> 32:08.369
We haven't always been
as close as I'd like,

32:08.397 --> 32:10.965
but we're going to have a child.

32:10.999 --> 32:13.067
We've been chosen.

32:13.101 --> 32:16.237
I need to know that I'm your first choice.

32:16.271 --> 32:18.506
You are.

32:19.541 --> 32:22.176
And that there hasn't been anyone else.

32:32.354 --> 32:34.122
I told myself I was being paranoid,

32:34.156 --> 32:35.423
that it was one-sided.

32:35.457 --> 32:37.659
"Let him have a crush," I thought.

32:37.693 --> 32:38.926
"Let him envy me!"

32:38.952 --> 32:42.006
I ended it. I ended it to be with you.

32:42.965 --> 32:46.000
Sleeping with an officer's
wife, that is serious enough,

32:46.035 --> 32:47.869
but now that your implant is gone...

32:48.113 --> 32:50.047
Duke, I would never!

32:50.072 --> 32:52.907
If he touches you now, that
is treason against the ship,

32:52.941 --> 32:54.876
and I will make sure

32:54.910 --> 32:57.979
he goes straight back to the lower decks.

33:03.931 --> 33:05.364
This way!

33:09.706 --> 33:11.206
Come on!

33:15.764 --> 33:17.465
Stop where you are!

33:23.993 --> 33:26.482
How did you get past the checkpoint?

33:26.507 --> 33:28.415
TC Group. Full authorization.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.483
Step aside.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.175
Yes, sir. I apologize.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.346
All right. Thank you.

33:37.085 --> 33:40.287
An armed contingent just arrived from TC.

33:40.321 --> 33:42.923
There's been a vote of no confidence.

33:42.957 --> 33:46.226
The TC Group wants to
move in another direction,

33:46.260 --> 33:48.533
and I'll be taking a more hands-on role

33:48.558 --> 33:49.992
for the time being.

33:50.017 --> 33:53.019
They're arriving to
escort me off the premises,

33:53.368 --> 33:56.470
drive me into a field somewhere?

33:56.504 --> 33:58.035
Katherine, please!

33:58.060 --> 34:01.684
I told you we are close.
I've had a success!

34:01.709 --> 34:04.311
All you have done is conceal the truth

34:04.345 --> 34:07.447
about the anomaly, the
sabotage, the explosion.

34:07.482 --> 34:09.400
The Group feels you have
lost your objectivity,

34:09.425 --> 34:10.559
and they're right.

34:10.583 --> 34:12.284
You've become a liability.

34:13.087 --> 34:15.155
Perhaps if you had been more forthcoming,

34:15.156 --> 34:17.080
you wouldn't find
yourself in this position.

34:17.105 --> 34:19.174
Well, what are you gonna tell my family,

34:19.199 --> 34:21.839
that I drove my car off a bridge?

34:21.871 --> 34:23.331
Or is it gonna be a hiking accident?

34:23.356 --> 34:25.291
Oh, don't torture yourself!

34:25.315 --> 34:27.829
Harris, your family will
be well provided for.

34:27.853 --> 34:30.723
So, all of this, keeping me
here, was just to keep me busy

34:30.748 --> 34:32.382
until my retirement squad arrives?

34:32.407 --> 34:34.703
Listen, I know you
consider this a betrayal.

34:34.728 --> 34:36.659
Without me, this project is over.

34:36.685 --> 34:40.371
The 600 people on that ship don't
stand a chance. You'll fail.

34:40.396 --> 34:42.938
And they'll be gassed inside of
6 months, and you know it!

34:43.576 --> 34:45.342
You've already failed, Harris.

34:45.368 --> 34:47.047
- Katherine, please!
- It's over.

34:47.072 --> 34:49.708
I'm begging you! Katherine?

34:50.659 --> 34:53.460
Please! Listen to me!

34:57.799 --> 34:59.266
Whatever you have planned,

34:59.301 --> 35:01.468
you sure you have enough to unseat him?

35:21.690 --> 35:23.924
Mrs. Denninger.

35:23.958 --> 35:26.160
Would you please tell the council

35:26.194 --> 35:28.762
the laws regarding the birth list?

35:28.797 --> 35:31.265
No man or woman will reproduce

35:31.299 --> 35:34.101
who has not been selected
from the birth list.

35:34.135 --> 35:37.502
Mm-hmm, and the children born
from unsanctioned pairings

35:37.527 --> 35:40.228
are a burden to the shipboard community.

35:40.347 --> 35:44.216
And their progenitors
are subject to discipline,

35:44.241 --> 35:45.947
are they not?

35:46.066 --> 35:47.362
The parent of an unclaimed

35:47.387 --> 35:49.455
is forbidden to hold office or rank.

35:49.749 --> 35:51.583
Exactly!

35:53.321 --> 35:55.055
Send them in, please.

36:19.781 --> 36:22.283
Director Warren.

36:22.317 --> 36:26.053
Mr. Carrillo, thank you for coming.

36:26.087 --> 36:28.150
Well, as you may have guessed,

36:28.175 --> 36:30.209
there's been a change in leadership.

36:30.234 --> 36:33.903
I'll be overseeing Ascension
during the transitional period.

36:33.928 --> 36:36.430
I want you to know how grateful I am

36:36.464 --> 36:38.732
for alerting me to the anomaly.

36:38.767 --> 36:40.934
I was just doing my job.

36:40.969 --> 36:42.643
Well, that's why I'm keeping you on.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.702
I look forward to working with you.

36:59.955 --> 37:02.990
Katherine, please!

37:03.024 --> 37:06.727
Director Warren, please!

37:06.761 --> 37:09.663
Katherine, I'm begging you!

37:09.698 --> 37:11.632
Look at me!

37:11.666 --> 37:14.001
Come on, this way!

37:15.270 --> 37:16.937
Come on!

37:30.314 --> 37:32.181
Christa.

37:33.813 --> 37:36.749
Christa!

37:36.774 --> 37:38.608
Christa!

37:41.897 --> 37:44.131
I wanna show you.

38:09.858 --> 38:12.467
You didn't congratulate me!

38:12.492 --> 38:14.311
I'm gonna be a father!

38:14.336 --> 38:15.170
Duke...

38:15.195 --> 38:17.296
After all these years of waiting,

38:17.321 --> 38:18.891
I should be happy about it, but I'm not,

38:18.916 --> 38:20.249
'cause, see, I just found out

38:20.274 --> 38:23.576
that my wife has been
sleeping with another man!

38:24.471 --> 38:27.340
You couldn't find your own woman, huh?

38:30.944 --> 38:35.548
Goddamn Decker! You put
your hands on my wife!

38:36.013 --> 38:37.914
Captain...

38:40.488 --> 38:43.690
You know this woman and child, don't you?

38:43.724 --> 38:47.161
And what is the nature of
your relationship with them?

38:47.186 --> 38:48.387
None.

38:48.412 --> 38:49.535
None?

38:50.919 --> 38:53.843
You've been sending ration
credits to them, sir.

38:53.868 --> 38:56.503
I took it upon myself to
ensure food for the boy.

38:57.148 --> 38:58.648
Hardly an impeachable offense.

38:58.840 --> 38:59.806
Is that so?

38:59.832 --> 39:02.020
Now that it's out in the open,

39:02.045 --> 39:04.213
I find Councilman Davis' unwillingness

39:04.238 --> 39:06.640
to take responsibility
for his son shameful.

39:07.121 --> 39:10.490
It's bad enough that Davis
has broken the ship's laws,

39:10.515 --> 39:13.050
but to allow his own child to suffer

39:13.075 --> 39:17.144
so that he can maintain his
position and life of luxury

39:17.169 --> 39:18.502
is repugnant.

39:22.930 --> 39:25.165
Well...

39:25.199 --> 39:28.577
in light of these recent revelations,

39:28.602 --> 39:29.549
perhaps we should...

39:29.574 --> 39:32.138
The ship's bylaws are
quite clear on this matter.

39:32.163 --> 39:33.997
Goddammit, Rose!

39:40.849 --> 39:42.249
Councilman Davis,

39:42.283 --> 39:45.050
I'm afraid we are going to have to demand

39:45.075 --> 39:47.310
your immediate resignation.

40:05.792 --> 40:08.427
It's so bright!

40:08.452 --> 40:10.587
I can barely see!

40:14.587 --> 40:17.389
Stokes, please, we gotta
get out of here now!

40:21.261 --> 40:23.762
We've gotta go!

40:34.168 --> 40:38.338
Hans Yablon. I knew him.

40:42.243 --> 40:45.746
Captain Elgin.

40:47.110 --> 40:50.312
Mitchell Bowman. What... what is this?

40:50.518 --> 40:52.386
It's a memorial.

40:52.420 --> 40:56.690
All these people died without
ever knowing the truth?

41:02.419 --> 41:03.886
Dwight Crouch.

41:05.146 --> 41:07.748
Stokes, we gotta go now! Hey!

41:07.773 --> 41:09.774
We have to go now! Hey!

41:11.848 --> 41:13.282
Why did you bring me here?

41:13.575 --> 41:16.777
Why did you bring me
here to my son's grave?

41:35.313 --> 41:36.646
Lorelei!

41:54.195 --> 41:55.228
Duke!

42:29.919 --> 42:32.287
It's Christa.

42:48.246 --> 42:49.674
Oh! What was that?

42:50.168 --> 42:51.620
Did you see anyone?

42:57.654 --> 42:59.421
Dead.

43:06.727 --> 43:08.638
I underestimated you, Harris.

43:08.638 --> 43:10.927
That was one hell of a contingency plan!

43:10.952 --> 43:13.053
I swear I had nothing to do with it!

43:13.078 --> 43:15.010
I have never seen anything like it!

43:15.044 --> 43:16.345
Get him out of here!

43:16.379 --> 43:17.850
Find out what happened to the power!

43:17.875 --> 43:19.630
Katherine, listen to me!

43:19.655 --> 43:21.623
The bunker, it has massive redundancies.

43:21.648 --> 43:24.617
It's shouldn't be possible for
anything to short the system!

43:24.642 --> 43:27.365
Whatever it was, it came from that ship!

43:27.390 --> 43:29.124
It had to be Christa.

43:29.758 --> 43:31.492
Wait!

43:33.042 --> 43:35.043
The girl in Krueger's report.

43:35.068 --> 43:37.570
We have never had anything like it.

43:37.595 --> 43:40.612
She is Punctuated Evolution made real!

43:40.637 --> 43:43.639
Everything we've been working for.

43:45.876 --> 43:48.043
Tell me more.

44:00.824 --> 44:03.726
Mr. Gault! Wake up, please!

44:09.766 --> 44:12.201
I saw Lorelei.

44:12.235 --> 44:13.802
She led me here.

44:14.235 --> 44:16.469
Christa...

44:27.150 --> 44:29.051
Christa.

44:29.085 --> 44:30.886
Why did you bring me here?

44:33.064 --> 44:35.566
Stokes, listen to me. Listen to me!

44:35.591 --> 44:38.057
You're right! You're right!

44:38.082 --> 44:41.087
Their lives were wasted, but not yours.

44:41.112 --> 44:43.580
You know the truth, Stokes. You can help.

44:43.686 --> 44:46.054
You can save the people still on Ascension.

44:46.079 --> 44:48.247
Hands in the air!

44:48.604 --> 44:51.372
Stay where you are, and show me your ID.

44:51.407 --> 44:54.209
OK! Samantha Krueger.

44:54.243 --> 44:55.944
Nice and easy.

44:55.978 --> 44:58.053
Special Operations.

44:58.078 --> 45:00.479
- Scan it.
- OK, OK!

45:09.225 --> 45:11.226
Hey! That's enough!

45:11.261 --> 45:14.663
Hey, that's enough! We gotta go!

45:15.932 --> 45:17.099
Come on!

45:22.628 --> 45:25.697
It's this one here! Here! Get in!

45:30.217 --> 45:32.852
Hey! Hey! Get in!

45:32.877 --> 45:34.311
Get in!

45:38.488 --> 45:40.456
You're bleeding.

45:43.960 --> 45:46.028
OK! OK!

45:54.104 --> 45:57.840
Gault! Gault! Come on!

45:57.874 --> 46:00.109
Come on, wake up! Wake up!

46:00.681 --> 46:01.648
What?

46:01.673 --> 46:03.107
You must've been caught

46:03.132 --> 46:04.869
in the electrical discharge from the surge.

46:04.881 --> 46:06.481
You are lucky to be alive

46:06.516 --> 46:07.783
Surge?

46:07.817 --> 46:10.786
I don't understand what happened!

46:13.323 --> 46:15.991
What's going on?

46:22.699 --> 46:24.900
Oh my God!

46:28.171 --> 46:30.038
Oh!

46:30.073 --> 46:32.574
Take cover!

46:34.877 --> 46:37.079
I need Gate 23 open, goddammit!

46:37.113 --> 46:40.048
Carrillo! I need answers.

46:41.050 --> 46:42.484
Uh...

46:42.518 --> 46:44.553
Every system connected to the ship is out,

46:44.587 --> 46:46.988
electrical, surveillance, security.

46:47.023 --> 46:49.091
What about the backup generators?

46:49.125 --> 46:50.345
All fried.

46:50.370 --> 46:52.939
It must've been a massive
electromagnetic burst.

46:52.964 --> 46:55.164
I had to reroute to even get some power!

46:55.189 --> 46:56.622
How long till we're back up?

46:56.647 --> 46:57.892
This has never happened.

46:57.917 --> 46:59.236
It's the first time in 50 years

46:59.261 --> 47:01.025
we don't have eyes on the ship.

47:01.279 --> 47:03.013
Both of them?

47:03.038 --> 47:04.438
What?

47:05.351 --> 47:07.719
Stokes is working with Krueger.

47:07.744 --> 47:09.345
She broke him out.

47:10.412 --> 47:12.213
Yes, I was wrong, Harris,

47:12.247 --> 47:14.892
but I was so certain you
were hiding something,

47:14.917 --> 47:16.767
I couldn't see what she was up to.

47:16.792 --> 47:17.994
Who's she working for?

47:18.019 --> 47:19.786
Well, I thought it was me!

47:21.831 --> 47:24.600
You just focus on getting
Ascension back online.

47:24.625 --> 47:25.959
You were gonna kill me.

47:25.984 --> 47:27.682
And now I'm giving you the opportunity

47:27.707 --> 47:28.874
to get your job back.

47:31.130 --> 47:34.633
If this girl is really
responsible for all of this,

47:34.658 --> 47:37.660
you've made a remarkable breakthrough.

47:40.690 --> 47:42.557
Until the comm systems are back up,

47:42.582 --> 47:43.815
we're going deck to deck,

47:43.840 --> 47:45.337
checking all the essential systems.

47:45.362 --> 47:47.334
So far, no sign of sabotage.

47:47.359 --> 47:49.927
I remember what happened
in the wake of the fire.

47:49.952 --> 47:51.538
Crisis brings out the worst in people.

47:51.563 --> 47:54.432
I'm depending on your safety
officers to keep the peace.

47:54.457 --> 47:56.677
Dr. Bryce, what the hell's
happening to my ship?

47:56.702 --> 47:58.336
It was a massive power discharge.

47:58.361 --> 48:00.786
I haven't found what
originated it or what caused it.

48:00.811 --> 48:02.812
- Could it be the reactor?
- No, no!

48:02.837 --> 48:04.175
The shielding is holding.

48:04.200 --> 48:06.910
The cooling levels, they're...
They're at an acceptable level.

48:06.935 --> 48:08.381
Mrs. Vanderhaus, are we still on course?

48:08.406 --> 48:10.013
I'll know once the nav computer's working.

48:10.038 --> 48:11.505
Right now, we're flying blind.

48:11.530 --> 48:12.497
XO on deck!

48:12.859 --> 48:14.311
It's about time, Gault!

48:14.336 --> 48:16.070
I need you to coordinate
a ship-wide damage survey

48:16.095 --> 48:17.329
with Mrs. Vanderhaus.

48:17.746 --> 48:19.632
Sir, shouldn't I be
helping out below decks?

48:19.657 --> 48:21.311
From what I've seen, people are panicking.

48:21.336 --> 48:22.798
You don't get to choose
your assignment, Gault.

48:22.823 --> 48:23.962
Next time you step on my bridge,

48:23.987 --> 48:25.352
you better not smell like a distillery.

48:25.377 --> 48:26.878
Are we clear?

48:34.696 --> 48:37.141
Jackie, help me take the
rest of these supplies

48:37.166 --> 48:38.399
down to Dr. Bryce.

48:38.424 --> 48:39.591
Who's Jackie?

48:40.904 --> 48:43.071
Who are you? What do you want?

48:43.106 --> 48:46.141
I was working on the midline
when it blew a circuit.

48:46.176 --> 48:48.877
I thought, hell, I've never
been in the officer's lounge.

48:48.912 --> 48:50.479
They've got some nice perks here.

48:50.513 --> 48:51.980
The lounge is closed.

48:52.015 --> 48:53.849
I'm taking this to medical.

48:53.891 --> 48:55.992
Oh, feeling charitable?

48:56.019 --> 48:57.686
I just got off the comm.

48:57.720 --> 49:01.256
The safety officers are
coming to take these supplies.

49:01.291 --> 49:04.426
That's a cute trick, with
the comms being down and all.

49:08.965 --> 49:11.934
What's the matter? Are you afraid?

49:13.203 --> 49:15.070
Let go!

49:25.737 --> 49:29.874
You bitch! That hurt!

49:38.494 --> 49:42.464
Oh my God!

49:42.498 --> 49:43.746
It's illuminated!

49:43.771 --> 49:46.878
My father had it hardwired
into the ship's reactor

49:46.903 --> 49:49.395
in order to ensure the illusion
would never be shattered,

49:49.420 --> 49:51.888
no matter what happened on the outside.

49:51.913 --> 49:53.247
So they don't know.

49:53.627 --> 49:56.229
Carrillo, have supply
bring up the spools of 220.

49:56.254 --> 49:59.047
We're gonna tap into the
ship's nuclear reactor.

49:59.082 --> 50:00.582
OK, right away!

50:00.617 --> 50:02.551
You look surprised to see me.

50:02.585 --> 50:05.120
This isn't the sort of
job you get fired from.

50:05.154 --> 50:07.152
Did you think about that
when you sold me out?

50:07.177 --> 50:09.767
Did you consider my wife, my son?

50:09.792 --> 50:11.627
Harris...

50:11.661 --> 50:12.861
Get the 220.

50:28.725 --> 50:30.426
What the hell is that?

51:50.793 --> 51:53.428
It's all right here!

52:06.137 --> 52:08.872
Sir, are you OK?

52:08.897 --> 52:11.232
You're bleeding.

52:11.257 --> 52:14.191
Um, I need painkillers.

52:14.216 --> 52:17.217
Acetaminophen, ibuprofen?

52:17.242 --> 52:18.327
As strong as you got.

52:18.352 --> 52:19.964
If you want anything stronger,

52:19.989 --> 52:21.890
you have to have a prescription.

52:21.915 --> 52:24.750
- Ow!
- Hey!

52:25.561 --> 52:27.828
Painkillers!

52:27.863 --> 52:28.996
Painkillers. Ow!

52:29.031 --> 52:30.398
Don't hurt him!

52:30.432 --> 52:32.266
Don't... don't hurt him! I'll get them.

52:37.651 --> 52:39.919
It's fried!

52:40.708 --> 52:43.076
Electrical is at 40%!

52:48.984 --> 52:51.452
Environmental, 30%!

52:51.486 --> 52:53.087
Come on!

52:54.723 --> 52:55.790
Come on!

52:55.824 --> 52:58.426
Cryogenic, no response!

52:59.494 --> 53:00.895
Scrubber Room, no response.

53:00.929 --> 53:03.364
Are you gonna tell me what happened?

53:03.398 --> 53:05.733
I was caught in the surge.

53:05.767 --> 53:07.271
Since when does an
electrical shock do that?

53:07.296 --> 53:09.264
It doesn't!

53:17.512 --> 53:18.798
Oh! Oh God!

53:18.823 --> 53:21.024
Hit the light! Hit the light behind you!

53:23.719 --> 53:25.120
Lay down!

53:28.157 --> 53:30.492
OK, all right.

53:34.497 --> 53:37.098
Must everything on this infernal planet

53:37.133 --> 53:39.201
be cocooned in plastic?

53:39.235 --> 53:41.591
Listen, you need to take this.

53:41.616 --> 53:42.850
What is it?

53:44.281 --> 53:46.449
If you're in trouble,

53:46.474 --> 53:49.385
you press and you hold down number 1, OK?

53:49.418 --> 53:50.636
- OK.
- It's on speed dial.

53:50.661 --> 53:52.096
Someone will come who can help you.

53:52.121 --> 53:53.121
OK.

53:53.146 --> 53:54.446
Oh God!

53:55.493 --> 53:57.960
Use it now, if it's so damn helpful!

53:57.985 --> 54:00.226
I don't wanna involve
her if I don't have to.

54:00.405 --> 54:03.397
We need to get out of the
country. We need to regroup.

54:03.422 --> 54:05.723
Don't go dying on me, OK?

54:05.748 --> 54:07.515
We don't have a lot of time!

54:07.540 --> 54:08.741
Mr. Carrillo?

54:10.587 --> 54:14.157
So, he wants to tap into
the ship's nuclear reactor.

54:14.182 --> 54:15.315
It seems questionable.

54:15.790 --> 54:17.624
It's already feeding the star field.

54:17.649 --> 54:20.284
We're just skimming enough
juice to run the monitors.

54:20.309 --> 54:22.258
Too much, and the stars will dim.

54:23.572 --> 54:26.007
He knows I sold him out.

54:27.086 --> 54:29.087
Don't worry about Enzmann.

54:29.112 --> 54:31.714
The terms we discussed are still in effect.

54:31.739 --> 54:33.504
You told him he'd run the project again.

54:33.529 --> 54:34.883
And he believed me.

54:34.908 --> 54:35.908
So stay close to him,

54:35.933 --> 54:37.667
make him think you're on his side.

54:37.766 --> 54:40.668
We need him until this
place is up and running.

54:40.693 --> 54:42.594
Why?

54:42.990 --> 54:44.758
The girl.

54:45.534 --> 54:47.702
If she's what Enzmann claims she is,

54:47.736 --> 54:50.071
the TC Group will be very happy.

54:50.105 --> 54:53.586
- We have a new problem.
- What now?

54:53.611 --> 54:55.745
When Ascension was built,

54:55.770 --> 54:58.138
there were no mobile
phones or satellite TVs.

54:58.163 --> 55:00.462
The R.F. jammers weren't
added until a decade later.

55:00.487 --> 55:02.255
They weren't hardwired to the ship.

55:02.280 --> 55:05.416
They could be picking up any
transmission in the spectrum...

55:05.441 --> 55:07.598
radio, digital, microwave.

55:07.623 --> 55:10.091
It doesn't take much
to shatter an illusion.

55:10.116 --> 55:11.449
I need to get to the jammers.

55:11.474 --> 55:12.621
They're in my office.

55:12.646 --> 55:14.064
Take Mr. Carrillo with you,

55:14.709 --> 55:15.909
and Medici.

55:17.404 --> 55:18.404
OK!

55:18.429 --> 55:20.630
I need those levels up on screen now!

55:23.072 --> 55:25.973
Yes, sir!

55:26.008 --> 55:27.493
OK...

55:29.228 --> 55:30.172
Excuse me, Dr. Bryce?

55:30.979 --> 55:32.547
Yeah, what is it, James?

55:32.581 --> 55:34.791
Something's happening with the Panopticon.

55:34.816 --> 55:36.483
There's a strange broadcast.

55:36.508 --> 55:37.508
Strange how?

55:39.288 --> 55:40.978
Automobiles and computers from Earth,

55:41.003 --> 55:43.671
but like nothing I've
ever seen in the library.

55:55.178 --> 55:57.846
It must be feedback from the main server.

55:57.871 --> 56:00.617
I've been having trouble with
it since the Ostara celebration.

56:00.642 --> 56:02.696
But aren't the archives
on a separate server?

56:02.721 --> 56:05.392
I designed the system, James.
I think I know it better than you.

56:05.424 --> 56:06.072
Yes, sir.

56:06.097 --> 56:08.298
If you really wanna be helpful, can you find Nora?

56:08.323 --> 56:09.791
Her mother's worried about her.

56:09.816 --> 56:11.312
Sir, I was told to remain on the bridge.

56:11.337 --> 56:13.171
And I'm telling you to find my daughter.

56:13.871 --> 56:14.871
Yes, sir!

56:41.270 --> 56:42.904
Christa?

56:43.966 --> 56:45.032
Dammit!

56:48.203 --> 56:50.371
OK.

56:58.647 --> 57:00.615
Christa!

57:01.077 --> 57:03.578
You unleashed an ocean, didn't you?

57:05.254 --> 57:06.888
Whatever caused that impact

57:06.923 --> 57:08.586
obviously knocked the
system out of alignment.

57:08.611 --> 57:11.212
Councilman Rose!
Councilman Rose, may I speak with you?

57:11.237 --> 57:12.537
Excuse me.

57:12.859 --> 57:14.192
What can I do for you, Jackie?

57:14.217 --> 57:16.318
Someone threatened Viondra
in the officer's lounge.

57:16.756 --> 57:19.258
It's not safe out here. I
thought I could come with you.

57:19.283 --> 57:21.078
Really?
What made you think that?

57:21.103 --> 57:23.705
After the way you
undermined me in the council,

57:23.739 --> 57:25.607
now you're seeking refuge under my wing?

57:25.641 --> 57:28.252
- You're dumber than I thought!
- Look, please, I didn't know.

57:28.277 --> 57:31.012
The litany of what you don't
know is too long a list.

57:31.047 --> 57:33.682
What I do know is that I
lost leverage because of you,

57:33.716 --> 57:34.903
'cause you were too busy

57:34.928 --> 57:36.793
being bent over the
massage table by Denninger

57:36.818 --> 57:39.567
to realize you were being played!

57:39.592 --> 57:41.092
No, let me come with you!

57:41.117 --> 57:42.751
Just for tonight.

57:44.033 --> 57:45.500
My dear Jackie,

57:45.525 --> 57:47.740
there is a cost for failure,

57:47.765 --> 57:50.534
a cost you are about to learn.

57:54.971 --> 57:57.486
When you've reached the forbidden planet...

58:03.145 --> 58:04.546
- Hello?
- Sam!

58:04.580 --> 58:06.581
Where are you? What's going on?

58:06.616 --> 58:08.750
Things got complicated.

58:08.784 --> 58:10.787
- You shouldn't have called.
- You got me involved in this.

58:10.812 --> 58:13.013
You think they won't
trace you to my website?

58:13.761 --> 58:15.629
There's a long-term parking lot

58:15.654 --> 58:16.771
on the corner of Lincoln and Fifth.

58:16.796 --> 58:18.197
Meet me there in an hour.

58:20.696 --> 58:23.999
How does it compare to the real thing?

58:25.301 --> 58:26.768
How the hell should I know?

58:26.802 --> 58:28.612
I've never been in space.

58:28.637 --> 58:32.106
At least they got alien princesses

58:32.141 --> 58:33.942
with hardly any clothes on.

58:33.976 --> 58:36.611
I need to... I need to go get some things

58:36.645 --> 58:37.822
if we're gonna disappear.

58:37.903 --> 58:39.637
Why are you helping me?

58:45.628 --> 58:47.262
Look...

58:48.901 --> 58:50.935
it's not just about you.

58:50.978 --> 58:52.812
It's the whole program,

58:52.837 --> 58:55.039
the idea that they can

58:55.064 --> 58:58.333
just engineer the whole
world to their liking,

58:58.358 --> 59:00.993
sweep everything under the table.

59:01.337 --> 59:02.570
It doesn't fit.

59:02.604 --> 59:04.572
So it's revenge?

59:04.606 --> 59:05.773
Balance.

59:05.798 --> 59:07.753
It's about time that I did something

59:07.778 --> 59:08.909
that I felt good about.

59:08.934 --> 59:11.936
You really think one action
can make up for another.

59:16.113 --> 59:17.647
I hope so.

59:22.902 --> 59:25.337
Bandages, opiates, rubbing alcohol?

59:25.362 --> 59:27.196
Where did all of this come from?

59:27.221 --> 59:29.455
The council's private emergency stash.

59:29.480 --> 59:32.015
I thought it may be better utilized here.

59:32.179 --> 59:33.667
Thank you, Viondra.

59:38.240 --> 59:41.041
I heard about the scare
in the officer's lounge.

59:41.076 --> 59:43.213
Sometimes a crisis gives weak men an excuse

59:43.238 --> 59:44.541
to prey on the fairer sex.

59:45.623 --> 59:48.258
Oh, it feels good to roll up my sleeves

59:48.283 --> 59:50.284
instead of putting on heels.

59:50.837 --> 59:53.071
Oh! Oh!

59:53.231 --> 59:56.033
Come here! OK, come on!

59:56.058 --> 59:57.492
Alison?

59:57.517 --> 59:59.860
Help me get her to the exam table.

01:00:00.996 --> 01:00:02.563
Hey! Alison?

01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:04.768
Let's go over the data again.

01:00:07.006 --> 01:00:09.374
What about the reports from Water Rec?

01:00:09.399 --> 01:00:10.926
Nothing significant. Why?

01:00:10.951 --> 01:00:13.486
Let's overlay the downed
systems on the schematic.

01:00:15.776 --> 01:00:17.243
There!

01:00:17.761 --> 01:00:20.330
On the beach. That's
where the surge started.

01:00:20.922 --> 01:00:24.979
Emily, Duke and I

01:00:25.004 --> 01:00:27.706
got into a fight down there.

01:00:27.731 --> 01:00:31.701
Suddenly, a blue light appeared,

01:00:32.327 --> 01:00:34.628
so bright, it hurt to look at it.

01:00:34.653 --> 01:00:35.863
Then nothing.

01:00:35.888 --> 01:00:38.223
I don't remember anything until...

01:00:39.835 --> 01:00:41.869
Christa woke me up.

01:00:42.537 --> 01:00:45.072
She said she saw Lorelei!

01:00:45.106 --> 01:00:46.074
Lorelei?

01:00:46.099 --> 01:00:48.934
She said she led her there.

01:00:49.927 --> 01:00:51.728
Emily?

01:00:51.753 --> 01:00:52.770
What's wrong?

01:00:52.795 --> 01:00:54.796
Em? Emily?

01:00:54.821 --> 01:00:55.821
Help!

01:00:57.224 --> 01:00:58.858
Come on!

01:01:02.438 --> 01:01:03.405
It's not funny!

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:04.398
You're right, it's not.

01:01:04.423 --> 01:01:07.058
This is exactly what I
expected to find you doing.

01:01:07.083 --> 01:01:08.650
Why were you looking for me?

01:01:08.675 --> 01:01:10.374
I thought you said we didn't have a future.

01:01:11.147 --> 01:01:13.749
Your father asked me to
find you. He's worried.

01:01:13.774 --> 01:01:15.996
Why? He knows where I am.

01:01:16.021 --> 01:01:17.755
Come on!

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:19.047
That's strange.

01:01:19.541 --> 01:01:22.142
I think he was trying
to get me off the bridge

01:01:22.177 --> 01:01:23.535
because of this broadcast I saw.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.442
Why do you think that?

01:01:24.467 --> 01:01:26.159
It was different from
anything I've ever seen,

01:01:26.184 --> 01:01:27.785
like, the clothes, the cars.

01:01:29.655 --> 01:01:32.157
Your father was acting
like it was no big deal,

01:01:32.182 --> 01:01:35.035
but I got the feeling he was
really worried that I saw it.

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:45.934
All right! We're live!

01:01:46.234 --> 01:01:47.801
Full system status report.

01:01:47.836 --> 01:01:50.636
I need to know everything
that's been going on in there.

01:01:50.661 --> 01:01:52.929
This is all over the news.

01:01:52.961 --> 01:01:55.419
That's Stokes, isn't it?

01:01:55.444 --> 01:01:56.466
Where is he?

01:01:56.491 --> 01:01:59.393
Robbed a pharmacy downtown,
grabbed booze and pills.

01:01:59.418 --> 01:02:01.286
His hands were covered in blood,

01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:03.212
but, apparently, he wasn't injured.

01:02:04.352 --> 01:02:06.086
Krueger.

01:02:06.121 --> 01:02:09.056
Oh! My problem just
might be solving itself.

01:02:09.081 --> 01:02:10.782
What about yours?

01:02:17.926 --> 01:02:20.966
Juliet! She passed out!

01:02:20.991 --> 01:02:23.319
Get her on the table.

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:26.475
What the hell's going on?

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.740
It must be hypercapnia.

01:02:27.765 --> 01:02:30.399
I have 3 other patients
with the same symptoms.

01:02:30.424 --> 01:02:31.657
An oxygen tank!

01:02:31.682 --> 01:02:34.117
The air-quality system
must be malfunctioning.

01:02:34.142 --> 01:02:35.442
When we were running checks,

01:02:35.467 --> 01:02:37.040
we couldn't get a response
from the Scrubber Room.

01:02:37.065 --> 01:02:39.967
If the scrubbers are out,
then CO2 toxicity is climbing

01:02:39.992 --> 01:02:41.293
with every breath we take.

01:02:41.614 --> 01:02:43.615
If it reaches 5%, it's fatal.

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:46.454
- What about our repair team?
- They're spread out all over the ship

01:02:46.479 --> 01:02:48.186
and the comms are down,
we won't be able to reach them.

01:02:48.211 --> 01:02:49.468
My mother worked the scrubbers.

01:02:49.493 --> 01:02:52.566
I was practically raised down there.
I'm not certified but I know the system.

01:02:52.591 --> 01:02:55.727
- I'll go with him. - No, no, no,
I need you on the upper decks, keep the peace.

01:02:55.752 --> 01:02:58.388
Gault and I will go down to
try to restart the scrubbers.

01:02:58.413 --> 01:03:00.915
Juliet, do you have any more oxygen tanks?

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:02.908
In the lab.

01:03:02.997 --> 01:03:04.798
Hey!

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:07.491
Why didn't you tell me
about the officer's lounge?

01:03:07.516 --> 01:03:09.292
I'm a grown woman, William.

01:03:09.324 --> 01:03:10.500
I'm capable of taking care of myself.

01:03:10.525 --> 01:03:11.336
That's not the point.

01:03:11.361 --> 01:03:13.862
You're my wife. It's my job to protect you.

01:03:15.503 --> 01:03:17.538
Take care of yourself this time, OK?

01:03:32.908 --> 01:03:34.542
What is all this stuff?

01:03:34.576 --> 01:03:36.987
It's plan B. It's my bug-out car.

01:03:37.012 --> 01:03:38.819
Are you all right?

01:03:38.844 --> 01:03:40.700
We need to get as far
away from here as possible.

01:03:40.725 --> 01:03:43.760
I got Stokes out as a witness.
They're gonna come after us.

01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:49.453
But, Sam, maybe we can talk
to someone, work something out!

01:03:49.478 --> 01:03:51.612
Tell them we'll go away, disappear.

01:03:51.637 --> 01:03:54.539
These people have one solution
for every kind of problem.

01:03:54.977 --> 01:03:56.978
I'm getting Stokes,

01:03:57.003 --> 01:03:59.515
and then we're getting the
hell out of Dodge, all of us!

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:01.370
Where are we going?

01:04:01.395 --> 01:04:03.785
Switzerland, Venezuela.

01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:06.545
Somewhere. We're going full Snowden.

01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:08.638
The world is gonna know about Ascension!

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:15.250
Come on! Get on this side!

01:04:15.275 --> 01:04:17.776
Come on! Come on! Hurry up!

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.406
Move!

01:04:22.431 --> 01:04:23.998
Hurry up! Hurry up!

01:04:30.632 --> 01:04:33.100
We're running out of oxygen tanks.

01:04:33.134 --> 01:04:34.435
At this rate,

01:04:34.469 --> 01:04:37.071
we'll have exhausted the
reserves within the hour.

01:04:38.373 --> 01:04:39.874
What is it, James?

01:04:39.908 --> 01:04:42.676
Actually, they sent me to
speak with you, Mrs. Denninger.

01:04:42.719 --> 01:04:45.163
We can't reach the captain or the XO.

01:04:45.188 --> 01:04:48.524
Spot checks of CO2 indicate
it's nearing fatal levels.

01:04:48.858 --> 01:04:50.292
Why are you telling me?

01:04:50.317 --> 01:04:51.829
Councilman Rose is in engineering.

01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:52.884
With the midline and comm out,

01:04:52.909 --> 01:04:54.541
we can't reach him or the other officers.

01:04:54.566 --> 01:04:55.956
According to the ship's bylaws,

01:04:55.981 --> 01:04:58.148
you're the highest ranking official.

01:04:58.173 --> 01:04:59.874
My position isn't command.

01:04:59.899 --> 01:05:03.335
Ma'am, you're the highest
ranking official we can find.

01:05:03.641 --> 01:05:05.175
What are your orders?

01:05:13.574 --> 01:05:15.942
Radiation alert protocol.

01:05:15.977 --> 01:05:18.716
Get as many people as you
can into the sleeping pods.

01:05:18.741 --> 01:05:21.343
Their oxygen supply could buy us some time.

01:05:25.553 --> 01:05:27.487
Radiation alert.

01:05:27.512 --> 01:05:30.918
Good God! This entire section is fried!

01:05:30.942 --> 01:05:33.978
Yeah.

01:05:34.003 --> 01:05:35.665
They called a radiation alert!

01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:38.325
Smart! It'll buy us some time.

01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:41.007
I'm at 30%! You?

01:05:41.032 --> 01:05:44.289
20! The scrubber room is on
the other side of this hatch!

01:05:44.314 --> 01:05:46.782
Fine! Let's get that door open!

01:05:51.721 --> 01:05:52.855
Shit!

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.181
Harris, there's something you should see.

01:05:58.437 --> 01:06:02.007
The ship's carbon-dioxide
scrubbers are offline.

01:06:11.299 --> 01:06:12.967
Get me a full analysis...

01:06:13.001 --> 01:06:15.511
cubic metres of breathable
air, rate of toxicity.

01:06:15.536 --> 01:06:17.611
I need to know exactly how long they have.

01:06:17.754 --> 01:06:19.421
4% and rising.

01:06:19.446 --> 01:06:22.147
They're all gonna die.
We have to do something.

01:06:22.172 --> 01:06:24.206
What? Open the windows?

01:06:24.231 --> 01:06:26.951
It's completely sealed with a double hull.

01:06:26.976 --> 01:06:27.918
This thing was designed

01:06:27.943 --> 01:06:29.978
to take the direct impact of an asteroid.

01:06:30.003 --> 01:06:31.437
Maybe if we open up the airlocks,

01:06:31.462 --> 01:06:33.630
use the turbine
to suck out the CO2.

01:06:33.655 --> 01:06:35.553
We barely have enough
power to run the monitors,

01:06:35.578 --> 01:06:37.145
much less the turbines!

01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:40.939
Their only hope is to
get the scrubbers working.

01:06:41.081 --> 01:06:43.716
It's up to them.

01:06:43.741 --> 01:06:45.976
Then we're going in now.

01:06:46.714 --> 01:06:49.103
It's the perfect opportunity
to get the girl out.

01:06:49.135 --> 01:06:53.316
You can't! It's a complicated
process to board the ship.

01:06:53.341 --> 01:06:55.308
We need to create a plausible reason.

01:06:55.343 --> 01:06:57.811
- They're in their pods.
- Not all of them!

01:06:57.852 --> 01:07:00.584
It's a delicate ecosystem.
Christa is the heart of it.

01:07:00.609 --> 01:07:01.809
If you take her out,

01:07:01.834 --> 01:07:03.401
you can't expect it to survive.

01:07:03.426 --> 01:07:05.528
And if they don't repair the scrubber,

01:07:05.553 --> 01:07:07.454
she dies along with the rest of them.

01:07:07.479 --> 01:07:09.847
Are you willing to take
that chance, Harris?

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:12.311
I'm not.

01:07:13.455 --> 01:07:14.955
Medici, you're going in!

01:07:17.154 --> 01:07:18.655
I'm sorry, Harris,

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.643
but it looks like your space
heroes aren't heroes at all.

01:07:21.668 --> 01:07:22.722
They're just men...

01:07:24.135 --> 01:07:25.602
and men die.

01:07:38.366 --> 01:07:39.410
Christa?

01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:42.872
Christa, I've been
looking everywhere for you!

01:07:43.298 --> 01:07:44.744
What are you doing down here?

01:07:44.744 --> 01:07:47.318
Lorelei wanted to show
me what was in the water.

01:07:47.343 --> 01:07:49.944
There's nothing down there, Christa.

01:07:49.969 --> 01:07:52.136
It's just a reservoir.

01:07:52.161 --> 01:07:53.962
It's farther down.

01:07:56.256 --> 01:07:58.857
I saw it rise up.

01:07:58.892 --> 01:08:02.728
What else did Lorelei tell you?

01:08:02.762 --> 01:08:05.264
That none of this is real,

01:08:05.298 --> 01:08:08.400
that they're gonna try
and take me off the ship.

01:08:08.445 --> 01:08:09.611
Who, Christa?

01:08:09.636 --> 01:08:11.847
Who's gonna come and take you?

01:08:11.872 --> 01:08:13.139
Globus.

01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:17.243
They're coming!

01:08:17.277 --> 01:08:19.912
Christa!

01:08:19.946 --> 01:08:20.991
Listen to me.

01:08:21.015 --> 01:08:23.384
Once you get in, you
cannot be seen by anyone.

01:08:23.408 --> 01:08:24.643
Just get me to the girl.

01:08:24.991 --> 01:08:26.125
Anyone stands in my way,

01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:27.645
I'll deal with them.

01:08:27.821 --> 01:08:29.354
You can't!

01:08:29.389 --> 01:08:31.323
Watch me.

01:08:38.974 --> 01:08:41.274
Clear the bridge of all non-essential crew.

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.935
Everyone into their pods. Yes, ma'am!

01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:45.770
James, what's the status on the comm?

01:08:45.805 --> 01:08:46.756
Still working on it, ma'am.

01:08:46.782 --> 01:08:48.635
As soon as they're back
up, try the scrubber room.

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:51.127
And don't stop till you
get an answer. Yes, ma'am!

01:08:52.145 --> 01:08:55.113
Wow! I always knew the true
power behind the captain,

01:08:55.148 --> 01:08:57.215
but now I see it with my own eyes.

01:08:57.250 --> 01:08:59.643
Councilman, you should
be in your radiation pod.

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:01.469
That would be a dereliction of duty.

01:09:01.493 --> 01:09:02.995
With the captain and XO missing,

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.587
it falls on me to
finally command this ship.

01:09:05.612 --> 01:09:07.001
They tried to reach you repeatedly.

01:09:07.026 --> 01:09:08.827
I was tied up in engineering.

01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:12.363
Oh, Viondra, look, I know it was you

01:09:12.399 --> 01:09:15.269
that masterminded that
double-cross with the council.

01:09:15.294 --> 01:09:16.861
I don't have time for...

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:19.703
How do you remember whose
face to show to whom?

01:09:19.728 --> 01:09:23.298
You never intended to help
me become captain. I get that.

01:09:23.323 --> 01:09:24.957
But let me ask you this:

01:09:24.982 --> 01:09:27.783
What kind of man would send his wife off

01:09:27.809 --> 01:09:30.102
to sleep with his enemy?

01:09:30.127 --> 01:09:32.582
One that isn't threatened by any man.

01:09:32.608 --> 01:09:34.354
Now, get your hand off of me!

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:37.020
You are a hell of a woman, Viondra.

01:09:37.045 --> 01:09:41.381
Thank you for keeping
my captain's seat warm.

01:09:43.063 --> 01:09:45.564
Remove the councilman from the bridge,

01:09:45.589 --> 01:09:47.832
see that he makes it
safely back to his pod.

01:09:47.857 --> 01:09:51.777
Ignore that! I'm the ranking
official on this bridge!

01:09:51.801 --> 01:09:53.636
When I was made acting captain,

01:09:53.661 --> 01:09:56.930
I issued a state of emergency
freezing the chain of command.

01:09:58.088 --> 01:09:59.955
Now get the hell off my bridge!

01:10:23.436 --> 01:10:25.771
Christa! Stop!

01:11:02.242 --> 01:11:06.178
This is Robert Bryce on
Ascension. Do you read me?

01:11:07.814 --> 01:11:09.762
This is Robert Bryce on Ascension.

01:11:09.787 --> 01:11:11.278
Do you read me?

01:11:26.833 --> 01:11:29.368
Is anyone there, please? Answer me!

01:11:32.472 --> 01:11:35.774
I'm, uh, getting feedback from the jammers.

01:11:35.809 --> 01:11:38.210
- What does it matter?
- Nothing.

01:11:38.245 --> 01:11:40.508
If you want the ham-radio
operators of the world

01:11:40.533 --> 01:11:42.434
to start getting signals from the ship.

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:45.684
Fix it.

01:11:52.359 --> 01:11:54.393
Is anyone there?

01:11:54.427 --> 01:11:56.496
Answer me! Is anyone there?

01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:58.356
Are you alone?

01:11:59.266 --> 01:12:00.867
Uh...

01:12:00.892 --> 01:12:02.126
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:05.120
Christa said someone from Globus is coming.

01:12:05.145 --> 01:12:06.879
Are you sending someone in?

01:12:06.904 --> 01:12:08.137
It's not me.

01:12:08.162 --> 01:12:09.529
You have to call them off.

01:12:09.554 --> 01:12:11.355
You cannot take her off this ship!

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:13.281
It's out of my hands.

01:12:13.306 --> 01:12:14.758
You have to get her out of there.

01:12:14.783 --> 01:12:16.350
- No, I can't!
- He's coming.

01:12:18.095 --> 01:12:19.763
No!

01:12:27.228 --> 01:12:30.096
The scrubber power grid is blown! Hurry!

01:12:30.121 --> 01:12:32.289
This whole place could go up!

01:12:35.802 --> 01:12:37.403
Goddammit!

01:12:37.437 --> 01:12:40.859
Gault! Gault!

01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:43.108
Gault, can you hear me?

01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:59.358
Stokes?

01:12:59.392 --> 01:13:01.447
Stokes!

01:13:01.472 --> 01:13:02.705
Oh, goddammit!

01:13:05.332 --> 01:13:08.233
How could they have found him?

01:13:08.268 --> 01:13:10.066
They could've combed
through the traffic cameras,

01:13:10.091 --> 01:13:12.314
tapped into the mapping satellite,

01:13:12.339 --> 01:13:13.672
following us ever since!

01:13:19.612 --> 01:13:21.246
Wait!

01:13:39.299 --> 01:13:40.933
Hey!

01:13:40.967 --> 01:13:43.268
I thought I told you to stay put.

01:13:43.303 --> 01:13:44.670
You did.

01:13:46.039 --> 01:13:48.240
Hmm! Is that your friend?

01:13:48.274 --> 01:13:50.175
Eva Marceau.

01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:52.845
I've heard a lot about you.

01:13:57.450 --> 01:14:00.152
I've only seen it in movies.

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:04.356
Guess that sounds pretty
pathetic to you, huh?

01:14:04.391 --> 01:14:05.824
Not at all.

01:14:05.859 --> 01:14:09.461
I'd like to be able to see
the moon for the first time.

01:14:12.732 --> 01:14:17.369
Shit may not have been
real, but it was my home.

01:14:17.396 --> 01:14:20.765
So far, the only thing that
impresses me about here...

01:14:22.042 --> 01:14:23.709
right there.

01:14:23.743 --> 01:14:24.977
Hang in there.

01:14:25.011 --> 01:14:28.247
It's gotta be better than the stockyards.

01:14:29.549 --> 01:14:30.816
We'll see!

01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:32.785
Get whatever you need from the room.

01:14:32.819 --> 01:14:34.686
It's time to go.

01:14:49.335 --> 01:14:51.837
You're good, you know that?

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:59.411
I never said where he worked.

01:15:03.783 --> 01:15:06.391
Is that how they kept the project a secret

01:15:06.416 --> 01:15:08.517
all these years?

01:15:08.888 --> 01:15:10.322
A honey trap?

01:15:10.356 --> 01:15:15.176
Anyone gets too close
to the truth, they find you?

01:15:15.201 --> 01:15:17.436
- Sam, please.
- No, I'm such an idiot...

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:22.501
to think that I actually thought

01:15:22.535 --> 01:15:23.802
I could make a difference.

01:15:30.577 --> 01:15:33.378
I'm sorry, sweetie,

01:15:33.413 --> 01:15:36.248
but the Starchild must be born.

01:16:08.067 --> 01:16:09.067
Damn it!

01:16:25.004 --> 01:16:28.357
Gault! Gault! Can you hear me?

01:16:29.488 --> 01:16:31.674
Gault! Come on, gotta get up!

01:16:31.674 --> 01:16:34.290
We have to get the scrubbers
working. We're out of oxygen!

01:16:34.315 --> 01:16:36.783
We don't need the scrubbers.
We need what's in them!

01:16:36.808 --> 01:16:37.908
Come here.

01:16:39.158 --> 01:16:40.192
Easy, easy.

01:16:40.217 --> 01:16:41.718
Lithium dioxide.

01:16:41.743 --> 01:16:43.735
I remember my mother refilling
the scrubbers with it.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.446
Carbon dioxide changes
into oxygen and water

01:16:46.471 --> 01:16:48.906
once it comes into contact with it.

01:16:48.931 --> 01:16:50.865
We have to find a way to
spread it through the ship.

01:16:56.853 --> 01:17:00.055
Bridge, I need all the
power to the HVAC system!

01:17:01.464 --> 01:17:03.031
Keep trying, Gault!

01:17:07.845 --> 01:17:09.212
Are you sure this will work?

01:17:09.246 --> 01:17:11.115
It's our only hope!

01:17:23.895 --> 01:17:26.371
- Christa!
- There.

01:17:26.396 --> 01:17:28.531
That's where they're gonna come from.

01:17:28.565 --> 01:17:32.334
You're right. They're coming for you.

01:17:33.058 --> 01:17:34.804
Bad people!

01:17:34.838 --> 01:17:36.906
Bad people like you?

01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:39.508
You remember, don't you?

01:17:43.046 --> 01:17:45.214
Lorelei knew the truth.

01:17:48.285 --> 01:17:49.953
That's why you killed her?

01:17:51.689 --> 01:17:54.023
I didn't wanna hurt her.

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:58.428
She was gonna ruin everything.

01:17:59.663 --> 01:18:03.099
I stopped her to save us all.

01:18:14.645 --> 01:18:16.779
This is the XO. Do you read me?

01:18:17.881 --> 01:18:20.016
Bridge!

01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:22.318
XO, are you there?

01:18:23.621 --> 01:18:25.255
Viondra, is that you?

01:18:26.824 --> 01:18:28.424
I'm here, William.

01:18:29.768 --> 01:18:31.669
CO2 levels are toxic.

01:18:31.694 --> 01:18:33.824
The crew isn't gonna last much longer.

01:18:33.849 --> 01:18:35.925
Listen, I need your help!

01:18:35.951 --> 01:18:38.686
We have to spread lithium
dioxide through the ventilation

01:18:38.711 --> 01:18:39.945
to make oxygen.

01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:42.251
Come on, we've gotta get out of here.

01:18:42.276 --> 01:18:43.943
Christa, these men...

01:18:43.968 --> 01:18:46.803
These men, Christa, if they
get you, they will hurt you.

01:18:46.828 --> 01:18:49.563
They will dissect you like a lab rat.

01:18:49.588 --> 01:18:52.089
Please, come with me.

01:18:53.273 --> 01:18:55.408
OK.

01:18:55.433 --> 01:18:58.335
Please! Come on!

01:19:11.468 --> 01:19:14.036
I want full power to the
ventilation system now.

01:19:17.307 --> 01:19:19.542
All right! Let's do this!

01:19:40.798 --> 01:19:42.398
No!

01:19:43.701 --> 01:19:45.268
You can't have her.

01:19:48.739 --> 01:19:51.040
- You feel that?
- Gault, help me!

01:19:57.548 --> 01:20:01.084
I felt this before on the beach.

01:20:05.956 --> 01:20:08.191
Lorelei?

01:20:08.225 --> 01:20:09.826
Gault!

01:20:10.928 --> 01:20:12.061
Gault!

01:20:43.694 --> 01:20:46.622
No! Let go of me! No!

01:20:46.655 --> 01:20:48.665
No! No!

01:20:48.699 --> 01:20:50.667
Let go! No! No!

01:20:50.701 --> 01:20:53.103
Don't let them take you.

01:20:57.108 --> 01:21:00.316
Ma'am! The oxygen levels are rising!

01:21:40.121 --> 01:21:42.189
They did it!

01:22:03.675 --> 01:22:05.710
Let me go!

01:22:05.735 --> 01:22:07.636
Help me! Somebody help!

01:22:10.414 --> 01:22:11.715
Please! Let go of me!

01:23:18.515 --> 01:23:20.349
Where's the picture?

01:23:20.384 --> 01:23:22.718
Where's the goddamn picture?

01:23:35.532 --> 01:23:38.167
I told him I didn't wanna go.

01:23:42.873 --> 01:23:45.875
I told him...

01:23:45.909 --> 01:23:48.377
What is happening in there, Medici?

01:23:48.412 --> 01:23:49.645
Answer me!

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.981
Medici!

01:23:52.015 --> 01:23:54.083
Answer me, goddammit!

01:23:54.117 --> 01:23:55.885
I don't want any "I told you so's,"

01:23:55.919 --> 01:23:57.320
Harris, because this isn't over!

01:23:57.354 --> 01:24:00.423
I am not about to go back
to the TC Group empty-handed.

01:24:01.214 --> 01:24:02.433
Medici!

01:24:02.458 --> 01:24:04.392
Medici, answer...

01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:09.784
You're wrong.

01:24:09.809 --> 01:24:14.613
They are heroes, and
they're going to space.

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:26.782
Call the TC Group.

01:24:26.816 --> 01:24:30.619
Director Warren had an accident.

01:25:18.668 --> 01:25:21.103
It works.

01:25:24.841 --> 01:25:27.276
Huh?
