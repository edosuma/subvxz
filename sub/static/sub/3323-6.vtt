his heart rate with his phone while he jogs,

wear it for the rest of the day.

When you're playing lacrosse, when you're
with Allison, whenever you get angry.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.635
Maybe learning to control it is tied to
learning to control your heart rate.

I need your help.

30:21.070 --> 30:22.230
If you can hear me,

30:22.530 --> 30:23.690
I need you to give me a sign.

30:25.241 --> 30:26.481
Blink.

30:26.701 --> 30:28.817

in the right direction, okay?

Laura?

30:50.558 --> 30:55.177
Whoever he is, he's an Alpha now.
But he's one without a pack.

30:56.897 --> 30:58.728
Which means he's not as strong.

31:03.779 --> 31:05.815
I can take him.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.527
But I have to find him first.

31:10.411 --> 31:12.197
Look, if you know something,
just give me a sign.

31:13.372 --> 31:14.327
Is it one of us?

31:17.668 --> 31:18.999
Someone else make it out of the fire?

31:22.006 --> 31:26.375
Just give me anything.
Blink, raise a finger, just anything.

31:31.057 --> 31:34.720
You think after six years of this,
yelling at him is going to get a response?

31:34.935 --> 31:36.641
- You got a better method?
- Patience.

31:36.937 --> 31:38.768
He'll respond if you give him the time.

you're my best friend,

I'm not angry anymore.

33:21.125 --> 33:25.084
Look, you have something, Scott. Okay?

33:25.629 --> 33:27.085
Whether you want it or not,

33:27.756 --> 33:30.714
you can do things that nobody else can do.

33:33.137 --> 33:35.093
So that means
you don't have a choice anymore.

- Three months ago. The deer.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.149
You remember this?

34:34.198 --> 34:37.531
Oh, yes. It's just a deer. And I didn't find it.

34:37.743 --> 34:40.701
They called me because they wanted to
know if I'd ever seen anything like it.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.198
What'd you tell 'em?

34:42.414 --> 34:43.665
I told them no.

Did you hear that?

The sound of your heartbeat rising.

34:58.722 --> 34:59.677

I want to know why you're lying.

I don't know what you're talking about.

35:32.339 --> 35:34.045
What are you doing to me!
What do you want?

I want to know who you are

he can keep himself from healing,

Are you out of your mind?

35:49.273 --> 35:51.059
You want to know what
the spiral means, Scott?

35:51.275 --> 35:53.061
It's our sign for a vendetta, for revenge.

35:53.277 --> 35:55.108
It means he won't stop killing
until he's satisfied!

- But we're still gonna do it?
- Can you think of something better?

37:11.146 --> 37:14.889
Well, personally I'm a fan of ignoring a
problem until eventually it just goes away.

38:04.616 --> 38:05.480
I don't know.

if he does show up?

position to the rest of the pack, right?

38:16.712 --> 38:19.499
Right, but if you bring him here,
does that make you part of his pack?
