00:01.251 --> 00:04.796
Mr. Turner? You remember me?
I'm Officer Reyes.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.965
I hope you guys know what you're doing.

00:08.592 --> 00:09.676
Where is she?

00:09.760 --> 00:11.512
We need to learn to talk his language.

00:11.595 --> 00:16.475
The baby, he should never have been here.
It was a mistake.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.645
Leanne has a bad habit
of exercising free will.

00:19.728 --> 00:23.815
Your only hope is to take her back
to where she is needed.

00:23.899 --> 00:27.277
<i>That's how you'll be reunited with him.</i>

00:27.361 --> 00:30.739
<i>We don't know much,
but there were reports of gunfire.</i>

01:18.887 --> 01:21.890
<i>We're told neighbors
reported a round of gunshots</i>

01:21.973 --> 01:25.060
<i>at 1:00 in the morning, half an hour ago.</i>

01:25.143 --> 01:27.354
<i>Authorities have yet
to release information</i>

01:27.437 --> 01:31.066
<i>on the whereabouts
or safety of the family inside.</i>

01:31.149 --> 01:35.153
<i>More on this case as it develops.
I'm Isabelle Carrick, 8 News.</i>

01:38.281 --> 01:40.826
Are you happy?

01:40.909 --> 01:44.663
Your disobedience has a cost.

01:45.872 --> 01:47.874
How could she be involved in this?

01:53.630 --> 01:55.799
What did you do to that family, George?

01:57.926 --> 01:59.261
Did you hurt them?

02:02.264 --> 02:04.391
Was it May? Is she behind this?

02:05.684 --> 02:06.935
You answer me.

02:07.644 --> 02:09.521
-What have you done?
-I knew it.

02:10.605 --> 02:13.942
He's gonna carve us up
and turn us into a Turner flesh suit.

02:16.903 --> 02:20.449
Leanne.
Follow her and find out what she knows.

02:24.619 --> 02:25.746
Leanne.

02:29.541 --> 02:30.542
Leanne.

02:32.627 --> 02:33.962
I wanna talk to you.

02:35.172 --> 02:37.507
I need you to tell me
what happened at the Marino place.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.384
Please, leave me alone.

02:40.009 --> 02:43.138
Leanne, I'm desperate.
I need you to tell me something. Anything.

02:43.221 --> 02:45.557
I should never have come here.

02:45.640 --> 02:47.142
What do you mean? Why not?

02:47.225 --> 02:51.855
It-- It wasn't my place,
and now it's too late. It's all too late.

02:52.647 --> 02:55.275
You're not gonna fix anything
locked in the attic.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.861
Will you come out here, please?

03:00.697 --> 03:01.740
George.

03:01.823 --> 03:04.201
What did May do to them?

03:10.248 --> 03:11.249
George?

03:14.586 --> 03:16.588
You really think they're behind this?

03:17.422 --> 03:19.466
He was obsessed with sending Leanne
back to that house,

03:19.549 --> 03:21.426
and now a violent attack.

03:21.510 --> 03:23.095
Maybe that was intended for her.

03:24.221 --> 03:27.099
Well, I'm not getting
my goddamn throat slit.

03:31.186 --> 03:33.814
What is he in, a fucking coma?

03:33.897 --> 03:35.857
I don't know.

03:35.941 --> 03:38.902
He knows he's guilty,
that's why he's not answering us.

03:39.528 --> 03:40.737
He's faking it.

03:44.074 --> 03:45.242
I don't know, Dottie.

03:46.743 --> 03:47.744
This is good.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.247
This means we have something
they really need.

03:50.330 --> 03:53.625
We have the upper hand now
and that's how we'll get Jericho back.

03:55.043 --> 03:57.421
We won't let you intimidate us!
Do you hear me?

04:03.677 --> 04:05.053
Who are they, the Marinos?

04:05.137 --> 04:08.098
They were a family just like yours.

04:08.181 --> 04:11.059
And why were you supposed to be there?
Explain that to me.

04:11.143 --> 04:12.227
He sent me.

04:12.310 --> 04:13.562
Who? Uncle George?

04:14.187 --> 04:17.441
Someone reads the signs
and tells us where we're meant to go.

04:17.524 --> 04:22.654
Everybody has their place
and I disobeyed his will by coming here.

04:22.738 --> 04:23.947
I broke the rules.

04:24.781 --> 04:27.325
Well, what happens
when you break the rules?

04:40.172 --> 04:42.758
-Anything?
-I'm trying.

04:48.138 --> 04:49.222
What's this?

04:49.306 --> 04:51.058
I reported on this cult.

04:51.141 --> 04:54.478
I know more about them than anyone
at the network, more than the police.

04:55.354 --> 04:58.106
I need to prove they did this.
Prove they're still active.

04:59.775 --> 05:04.237
Cults survive on discretion, and something
like this means they're panicking.

05:04.321 --> 05:05.822
What are you looking for?

05:05.906 --> 05:09.368
Evidence. Maybe they've done
something like this before.

05:14.247 --> 05:17.376
You can drop the act, brother.
It's just the two of us.

05:21.004 --> 05:22.506
I know you can hear me.

05:28.637 --> 05:30.138
Okay. Fine.

05:47.322 --> 05:48.323
Motherfucker.

06:38.623 --> 06:40.417
Hi, Eric. It's Dorothy Turner.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.877
How are you?

06:44.838 --> 06:47.132
Yeah, you know,
I have a quick favor to ask.

06:47.215 --> 06:52.054
I was wondering if you had
any info on Isabelle's story.

06:54.765 --> 06:56.558
Yeah, the Marino family.

06:58.602 --> 06:59.603
Oh, my...

07:00.354 --> 07:02.147
No, thank you.

07:02.814 --> 07:04.524
You're the best, Eric. Thanks.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.361
It's bad.

07:08.820 --> 07:10.447
A triple homicide.

07:11.490 --> 07:12.532
Christ.

07:12.616 --> 07:15.869
But get this,
the youngest child is missing.

07:17.704 --> 07:18.789
A little boy.

07:57.411 --> 08:01.289
<i>As tributes pour in
following this tragic update,</i>

08:01.373 --> 08:02.916
<i>concern continues to grow</i>

08:02.999 --> 08:06.503
<i>over the fate of the missing
ten-year-old boy, Sergio Marino.</i>

08:06.586 --> 08:08.296
<i>Roadblocks are in place</i>

08:08.380 --> 08:11.842
<i>and volunteers are knocking on doors
in surrounding neighborhoods.</i>

08:11.925 --> 08:15.303
<i>But with bad weather headed this way,
the clock ticks.</i>

08:17.139 --> 08:20.517
Those people were murdered,
and the kid is missing.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.352
I know.

08:22.436 --> 08:25.731
Snatching tots, killing families.
What's that mean for us?

08:26.481 --> 08:28.692
We're safe. We have leverage.

08:29.943 --> 08:30.944
It's the cops.

08:32.571 --> 08:34.823
Good. They're here for Bozo.

08:34.906 --> 08:37.492
-Well, they can't have him.
-What are you, nuts?

08:37.576 --> 08:40.787
I have gotten us this far alone.
We're close.

08:40.871 --> 08:41.955
We need George to broker the deal.

08:42.039 --> 08:44.666
We cannot risk
any outside interference right now.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.585
They're the police, Dottie.

08:46.668 --> 08:49.755
Well, what good have Philly's finest
done for us this far?

08:50.964 --> 08:52.299
Look, if we let them take George,

08:52.382 --> 08:54.885
we'd be right back where we started
waiting for the phone to ring.

08:54.968 --> 08:55.969
So what do we do?

09:00.349 --> 09:01.350
Hide him.

09:01.433 --> 09:02.642
Hide him?

09:03.976 --> 09:07.272
Just get him out of here
and I will talk to the police.

09:09.107 --> 09:10.274
Grab his legs.

09:11.026 --> 09:12.235
God.

09:14.571 --> 09:15.572
Okay.

09:16.239 --> 09:17.532
Fuck.

09:20.535 --> 09:21.787
Fuck.

09:21.870 --> 09:23.497
Oh. Shit.

09:26.833 --> 09:27.959
Okay.

09:33.924 --> 09:34.966
Officer Reyes.

09:35.592 --> 09:38.220
Mrs. Turner, is everything all right?

09:40.180 --> 09:42.015
Is there some news about Jericho?

09:42.933 --> 09:44.643
No, I'm sorry.

09:45.936 --> 09:47.312
Do you mind if I come in?

09:48.480 --> 09:49.564
Sure.

09:54.236 --> 09:56.154
-Dropping him. I'm dropping him.
-Don't drop him!

09:56.238 --> 09:57.823
He's slipping. Fuck it.

09:57.906 --> 10:00.784
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Fuck.

10:01.910 --> 10:02.911
Fuck.

10:05.914 --> 10:07.416
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

10:08.166 --> 10:09.668
Where the fuck are you going?

10:09.751 --> 10:12.212
Shut up!
There's a fucking cop in the house.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.589
What the--

10:14.673 --> 10:18.010
Will you shut the fuck up?
You're breathing too loud. Shut up.

10:19.845 --> 10:22.681
I was actually hoping
to speak with your husband. Is he home?

10:22.764 --> 10:23.890
-Oh, my God.
-Sean?

10:23.974 --> 10:25.475
Sean-- Yes.

10:26.768 --> 10:28.478
Here he is now.

10:30.522 --> 10:32.733
Mr. Turner. How's your hand?

10:33.442 --> 10:35.360
Oh, fine. Thank you for asking.

10:36.111 --> 10:38.572
I wondered
if we might have a word in private.

10:39.239 --> 10:42.576
Or... we can all have a word together.

10:44.703 --> 10:45.704
Please.

10:50.959 --> 10:53.920
I'm sure you heard about
the family in West Chester.

10:54.004 --> 10:58.425
Yes. We just saw on TV. Horrific.

10:59.676 --> 11:02.179
Had you met the Marino family?

11:02.804 --> 11:06.266
No, not that I can recall.

11:07.017 --> 11:08.935
What about their nanny, Leanne?

11:10.979 --> 11:12.105
What is this?

11:12.898 --> 11:13.982
What's going on?

11:16.026 --> 11:17.027
Well...

11:18.362 --> 11:21.615
I was hoping you could tell me.

11:28.455 --> 11:32.167
<i>Hey, what's up, guys?
It's me, Sergio. Welcome back.</i>

11:32.250 --> 11:37.339
<i>Today I'm gonna talk about</i>
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered.

11:37.422 --> 11:40.092
<i>I really love this game
and the Gulag update</i>

11:40.175 --> 11:42.636
<i>and actually today
we have a special guest.</i>

11:43.637 --> 11:45.013
<i>No.</i>

11:45.097 --> 11:48.517
<i>Come on, Leanne.
You have to say "Hi" to the viewers.</i>

11:48.600 --> 11:50.560
<i>Don't be scared. I only have nine viewers.</i>

11:54.731 --> 11:56.733
<i>This is my babysitter, Leanne.</i>

11:56.817 --> 11:58.860
<i>She's actually pretty good at</i> Call of Duty

11:58.944 --> 12:01.363
<i>even though she's never
played video games before.</i>

12:01.446 --> 12:03.407
<i>She got 13 kills her first round.</i>

12:05.867 --> 12:07.744
<i>Okay, Sergio, can I go now?</i>

12:08.704 --> 12:10.038
<i>One more game.</i>

12:14.584 --> 12:16.586
I was gathering evidence.

12:16.670 --> 12:19.214
I was waiting till
I had something substantive.

12:20.006 --> 12:24.302
Do you understand how illegal
it was doing what you did? Spying.

12:24.386 --> 12:27.472
-You could have been arrested.
-Well, I knew you wouldn't believe me.

12:27.556 --> 12:31.476
The last time you were here, you
treated me like I was a mental patient.

12:31.560 --> 12:35.230
I am telling you
this cult has to be involved.

12:35.313 --> 12:37.232
It's why Leanne was there.

12:37.315 --> 12:40.485
They took my son and now
they've taken the Marino boy too.

12:40.569 --> 12:41.862
If you had listened to me sooner,

12:41.945 --> 12:43.905
maybe we could have
done something to stop this,

12:43.989 --> 12:46.616
but I am my son's best help.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.785
I understand your frustration, Dorothy.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.787
Believe it or not,
I'm just trying to help you.

12:50.871 --> 12:54.416
I will believe that
when you find Jericho before I do.

13:04.718 --> 13:06.178
Leanne!

13:12.976 --> 13:14.478
Is there somebody else here?

13:15.729 --> 13:17.981
No, it's just an old house. It's settling.

13:18.065 --> 13:21.068
Why... aren't you listening to me?

13:21.151 --> 13:23.111
This is a lead on May Markham.

13:23.195 --> 13:27.240
Listen to me, Dorothy.
Mr. Marino was under a lot of stress.

13:27.324 --> 13:29.034
What about the boy?

13:29.117 --> 13:32.162
He's missing, but Mr. Marino's note--

13:32.245 --> 13:34.039
Note? What note?

13:34.122 --> 13:35.832
He left a detailed note.

13:36.666 --> 13:38.043
We're looking for a body.

13:43.048 --> 13:44.716
Do you understand?

13:46.093 --> 13:48.345
No, that's just what
they want you to think.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.390
They must have written
that note themselves. It's a trick.

13:51.473 --> 13:54.142
No, Dorothy, there's no cult involved.

13:55.310 --> 13:59.356
Sometimes the mind sees
what it wants to. We connect dots that--

14:01.274 --> 14:03.819
I'm trying to help you understand.

14:05.320 --> 14:06.947
Do you understand?

14:09.199 --> 14:11.535
So it's all just a coincidence.

14:12.786 --> 14:15.706
Just bad luck. Nothing to do with us.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.419
Yes.

14:21.211 --> 14:25.006
Well, then nothing's changed...
and you're wasting time.

14:25.090 --> 14:27.217
So why don't you go do your job
and I will do mine.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.343
<i>Action.</i>

14:30.220 --> 14:32.097
<i>Leanne. Action.</i>

14:33.181 --> 14:34.933
<i>You have to finish your dinner, Serg.</i>

14:35.017 --> 14:37.352
<i>But I'm filming. I'm gonna be a celebrity!</i>

14:38.186 --> 14:41.982
<i>Well, we told your mom
that you will eat well tonight.</i>

14:42.733 --> 14:45.152
<i>Asparagus is gross.</i>

14:45.235 --> 14:46.236
<i>Fine.</i>

14:47.529 --> 14:49.156
<i>-You know who's coming.
-No.</i>

14:49.239 --> 14:52.409
<i>It's too late. She's already on her way.</i>

14:52.492 --> 14:56.371
<i>Have you been bad? Have you been mean?</i>

14:56.455 --> 14:59.124
<i>-You may get a visit from Aunt Josephine.
-No!</i>

14:59.207 --> 15:00.625
<i>-You better run!
-No!</i>

15:06.298 --> 15:09.634
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Marino. We're just playing.</i>

15:09.718 --> 15:11.178
<i>It's okay.</i>

15:11.261 --> 15:13.096
<i>Dad, are you okay?</i>

15:13.805 --> 15:16.850
<i>It's just nice to see you happy, Serg.
That's all.</i>

15:19.019 --> 15:20.270
What was that? The wind?

15:38.121 --> 15:41.375
You know, you think
I can get a glass of water?

15:42.167 --> 15:45.128
Sure. Yeah... I'll get it for you.

15:53.470 --> 15:54.930
Dorothy, are you okay?

15:55.639 --> 15:57.349
-We gotta move him.
-What?

15:57.432 --> 15:58.475
Pick him up.

15:58.558 --> 15:59.935
I just...

16:01.144 --> 16:04.690
This headache. It's like a needle.

16:06.149 --> 16:09.653
-Migraines. I know them well.
-Yeah.

16:10.570 --> 16:11.905
Up, up, up, up.

16:17.786 --> 16:19.329
Will you excuse me for a second.

16:39.016 --> 16:41.643
I appreciate it. Long night.

16:43.228 --> 16:45.480
-Sure you don't want something stronger?
-No.

16:45.564 --> 16:48.191
Frankly, I'm very concerned, Sean.

16:48.275 --> 16:51.028
Dorothy involved herself
in a very dangerous situation here.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.822
Well, yeah.
That's her reporter's instinct and--

16:56.283 --> 16:58.076
I've seen this kind of thing before.

16:58.160 --> 17:02.497
People like Dorothy have a tendency to
insert themselves in similar situations.

17:02.581 --> 17:07.335
They see a connection that's not there.
They relate to someone else's pain.

17:08.754 --> 17:12.215
I wanted to stop by and warn you.
I'm not even on duty.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.092
Well, I appreciate that.

17:14.718 --> 17:18.472
Well, I-- I'd feel a whole lot better
if I can take a quick look around.

17:18.555 --> 17:20.057
Off the clock.

17:22.601 --> 17:23.602
What for?

17:24.269 --> 17:27.356
It's just the Marino's nanny
is still unaccounted for.

17:27.439 --> 17:31.068
We can't ignore the connection here
no matter how tenuous it may be.

17:31.693 --> 17:33.779
It's better that I do it
than some other cops.

17:33.862 --> 17:36.281
-Right.
-Now you understand, don't you?

17:36.365 --> 17:38.824
-Yeah, yeah.
-Right.

18:08.480 --> 18:11.983
Well, this is my office,
but she's been using it for research.

18:13.235 --> 18:17.614
I looked into them, you know.
The Church of Lesser Saints.

18:18.532 --> 18:21.243
-You did?
-Yeah, of course.

18:21.326 --> 18:24.538
Even if I had doubts, I need to
check under every bridge. It's my job.

18:27.457 --> 18:30.585
They tricked people into thinking they--
they do miracles.

18:30.669 --> 18:32.337
But they're long gone, Sean.

18:40.554 --> 18:41.847
-Oh, my God.
-What's going on?

18:41.930 --> 18:43.306
She wanted to look around.

18:43.390 --> 18:46.184
-And Sean let her?
-'Course he did. It's Sean.

18:46.268 --> 18:47.394
Leanne--

18:48.937 --> 18:50.063
We gotta get him out of here.

18:52.858 --> 18:53.859
Here.

18:55.736 --> 18:58.071
This fascination she has
with this Leanne girl,

18:58.155 --> 19:01.533
I feel like I'm
still not getting the full picture.

19:03.618 --> 19:04.619
Well...

19:05.537 --> 19:09.291
after we got the doll,
Dorothy put the call out for a nanny,

19:09.374 --> 19:10.959
and we got a lot of résumés.

19:11.043 --> 19:13.003
We got a ton, and Leanne was one of them,

19:13.086 --> 19:15.797
and that was Dorothy's favorite,
you know, and--

19:15.881 --> 19:18.592
But when she saw the reality,

19:18.675 --> 19:21.553
you know, when she saw what
Jericho really was, she freaked out.

19:21.636 --> 19:24.389
I mean, she didn't take the job,
so we parted ways.

19:24.473 --> 19:26.475
Then Dorothy saw her on the street

19:26.558 --> 19:28.894
and realized she must be
working for another family,

19:28.977 --> 19:31.104
and she became obsessed with her.

19:31.188 --> 19:34.941
She just, you know, thought,
you know, Leanne was still our nanny.

19:36.068 --> 19:37.069
So...

19:38.820 --> 19:42.324
-That's an awfully big coincidence.
-Yeah, I know. It's crazy.

19:42.407 --> 19:45.911
And, you know, I shouldn't have let her
believe in it and-- and I recognize that.

19:57.089 --> 19:59.007
Just-- Just talk to her, Sean.

19:59.841 --> 20:00.842
Right.

20:06.473 --> 20:07.474
What's in there?

20:09.142 --> 20:12.104
That's the attic. You know, storage.

20:12.187 --> 20:15.357
We-- You know, we keep it locked.
It's-- It's private.

20:16.441 --> 20:17.442
So...

20:33.166 --> 20:34.501
Right. Hurry up.

20:34.584 --> 20:35.877
I'm carrying the weight.

20:40.632 --> 20:43.719
-All right. Just stay here.
-What? No.

21:05.115 --> 21:07.159
My God.

21:14.082 --> 21:15.667
Did Dorothy do this?

21:16.835 --> 21:19.504
She comes up here sometimes.

21:34.102 --> 21:35.103
Sean.

21:37.939 --> 21:40.692
Do you know what it takes
to hurt your own family?

21:43.779 --> 21:45.614
People aren't born like that.

21:46.448 --> 21:47.908
It's not natural.

21:47.991 --> 21:50.369
Mr. Marino was hurting,

21:50.452 --> 21:53.872
and his wife was sick,
and he refused to cope with the pain.

21:55.123 --> 21:56.958
Do you understand what I'm saying?

22:00.462 --> 22:01.963
Your wife needs help.

22:08.136 --> 22:10.305
-I'm sorry. I just--
-Are you good?

22:10.389 --> 22:12.766
I'm just a little dizzy.

22:15.143 --> 22:17.354
I'm just gonna head back down.
We're good here.

22:43.422 --> 22:45.340
I'm sorry to bother you, Dorothy.
It won't happen again.

22:46.258 --> 22:48.844
Oh. Let me walk you out.

22:49.636 --> 22:53.140
That's all right. I can show myself out.

22:53.223 --> 22:56.268
Listen, I know I crossed a line.

22:57.769 --> 22:59.229
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.400
It's more that I didn't
want you to hurt yourself.

23:08.989 --> 23:10.615
Shut the fuck up.

23:12.451 --> 23:13.702
Oh, my God.

23:14.786 --> 23:16.371
Damn it, will you--

23:20.292 --> 23:23.003
You can call me
if you start to see things differently.

23:25.088 --> 23:26.465
I'll be an honest friend.

23:42.481 --> 23:43.899
She's gone.

23:45.317 --> 23:46.610
What the fuck are you doing?

23:46.693 --> 23:47.944
I was just--

23:49.363 --> 23:50.822
Oh, never mind!

24:17.641 --> 24:21.061
<i>A tragic conclusion to a tragic case.</i>

24:21.144 --> 24:22.396
<i>Just a few minutes ago,</i>

24:22.479 --> 24:26.066
<i>press was notified that the body
of the youngest Marino child</i>

24:26.149 --> 24:30.153
<i>was found in a concealed crawl space
underneath the stairs.</i>

24:30.237 --> 24:32.781
<i>Sergio, only ten-years-old,</i>

24:32.864 --> 24:35.450
<i>sustained three bullet wounds
to the side of his head.</i>

24:35.534 --> 24:40.038
<i>He appeared to have been shot
through the wall by his own father.</i>

24:40.122 --> 24:42.999
<i>Our hearts go out to the friends
and family of the Marinos.</i>

24:43.083 --> 24:46.878
<i>We here at the station
are deeply saddened by this news</i>

24:46.962 --> 24:49.881
<i>and can only wish
that someone had been there</i>

24:49.965 --> 24:53.093
<i>to stop this senseless act of violence.</i>

25:02.728 --> 25:04.312
Let's make a deal here, George.

25:04.396 --> 25:07.858
You can have Leanne
and go wherever you want.

25:07.941 --> 25:11.653
It's your family, not ours. You have
your customs, I can appreciate that,

25:12.279 --> 25:14.281
but we want our son back.

25:16.616 --> 25:20.078
I need you to agree to bring Jericho back.

25:22.414 --> 25:23.582
Do you agree?

25:25.042 --> 25:26.626
Answer me, George.

25:26.710 --> 25:28.170
Let's make a deal here.

25:28.879 --> 25:30.464
Do you agree?

25:31.715 --> 25:33.967
Wake up, George! Answer me!

25:34.968 --> 25:36.136
Jesus! Be careful.

25:36.762 --> 25:38.847
-Make the deal!
-Don't antagonize him.

25:38.930 --> 25:40.557
Bring Jericho back.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.559
Say yes to the deal.

26:15.467 --> 26:16.718
It's addressed to him.

26:17.511 --> 26:18.845
Well, fucking open it.

26:25.852 --> 26:28.271
Stand back just in case.

26:41.326 --> 26:42.661
Is it a Betamax tape?

26:42.744 --> 26:45.247
Betamax?
Who the fuck uses Betamax anymore?

26:47.165 --> 26:48.417
The answer has come.

26:48.500 --> 26:49.710
George.

26:50.585 --> 26:53.588
Leanne must watch the tape tonight.
Give it to me.

26:55.048 --> 26:56.758
We must show her.

26:56.842 --> 27:00.303
There's no time to waste.
Wh-- Where is your Betamax player?

27:00.387 --> 27:02.723
-We don't have a Betamax player.
-Wrong decade, George.

27:04.349 --> 27:08.770
She must see the tape now.
She needs to know.

27:10.814 --> 27:11.815
But, George, wait.

27:11.898 --> 27:12.899
Let him go.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.195
It worked.

27:22.242 --> 27:23.910
I called their bluff.

27:37.716 --> 27:38.717
God!
