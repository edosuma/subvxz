OF EARRINGS.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.628
- STOP BEING
SO SPECIFIC, SHAWN.

07:55.670 --> 07:56.762
- THAT'S REALLY PRECISE.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.209

TO JUST DRIVE UP THERE.

AT A DIPLOMAT'S RESIDENCE.

08:13.590 --> 08:15.717
NEXT TIME WHY DON'T YOU TRY
AND GET US INTO NORTH KOREA?

08:17.830 --> 08:19.024
ON THE CHAIR.

08:19.060 --> 08:21.756
I HAD MY WALLET IN THE POCKET.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.798
- I AM SENSING THAT YOUR JACKET
IS IN THE KITCHEN

08:25.830 --> 08:28.264
IN A WINE CRATE,
BURIED UNDER SOME HAY.

08:28.300 --> 08:31.758

08:46.790 --> 08:48.109
I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

08:48.160 --> 08:50.685
WHY WE WOULD REFUSE ENTRY
TO SOMEBODY

08:50.730 --> 08:52.789
ON SUCH AN OUTLANDISH HUNCH.

08:52.830 --> 08:54.627
- OF COURSE WE CAN.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.025
- SO, WHAT, THEY JUST BUST OUT
IMMUNITY, AND THAT'S IT?

08:56.060 --> 08:58.665
- THEY JUST DID.
- [scoffs] AWESOME.

08:58.700 --> 08:59.860
PUT THAT ON MY BUCKET LIST.

08:59.900 --> 09:01.629

09:05.770 --> 09:07.772
NO, WAIT, JETPACK--

09:07.810 --> 09:10.643
- FORGIVE ME, GENTLEMEN,
BUT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND

09:10.680 --> 09:12.841
HOW UNCONVENTIONAL
ALL THIS SOUNDS.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.769
- OKAY, HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

09:15.820 --> 09:17.742
MOST INCREDIBLE THING
I'VE SEEN.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.917
I'M SO SORRY.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.724
HE FOUND MY JACKET...

09:22.760 --> 09:25.729
WITH HIS FINGER.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.058

09:31.730 --> 09:33.266

09:33.300 --> 09:35.768
- YES,
UP FROM THE SHOULDERS.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.598
SHE WAS WEARING NEW EARRINGS.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.702
- YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION
TO ENTER THE HOUSE.

09:42.750 --> 09:46.948
- RICHARD--
- HE'S DESCRIBING ANNABETH.

09:46.980 --> 09:51.747
- HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE,

10:07.100 --> 10:09.159
THAT'S--
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.964
YOU SEE,
I'M SO, SO, SO, SO SURE.

10:12.010 --> 10:13.739
- I DON'T THINK
MORE "SO"S IS THE ANSWER, SHAWN.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.771
- PERHAPS
YOU SHOULD CHECK AGAIN.

10:34.360 --> 10:37.727

ALL JUST INDULGE ME

10:37.770 --> 10:40.830
ONE LAST TIME.

I SENSE SOMETHING HERE.

10:59.090 --> 11:03.754

11:13.440 --> 11:15.761
DID SOMEONE FORGET
TO CHECK THE CHLORINE?

11:15.800 --> 11:18.769

TO BORROW YOUR FLASHLIGHT.

11:33.090 --> 11:34.910
- WELL?
- WELL, WHAT?

11:34.960 --> 11:36.825

YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:38.460 --> 11:39.620
I'M SORRY.

11:39.660 --> 11:42.823
I'M SORRY FOR EXPECTING A LITTLE
BIT OF HONESTY OUT OF YOU.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.808
- OKAY, FINE.
I AM SEEING SHAWN.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.468
WE HAVE BEEN DATING A WHILE.
WE KEPT IT FROM YOU.

11:52.510 --> 11:55.775
DOES THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY?
- HAPPY'S NOT THE WORD.

11:55.810 --> 11:57.505
I THINK WE NEED
TO SEE THE CHIEF.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.848
- OH, OKAY, SO NOW YOU WANT
TO TELL ON US.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.438
- ACTUALLY, O'HARA,
WE NEED TO SEE THE CHIEF

12:01.480 --> 12:03.789

I'M NOT REASSIGNING YOU.

12:26.140 --> 12:27.539
WE HAVE
A BIG MURDER CASE HERE.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.775
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN ASK
SUCH A THING?

12:29.810 --> 12:31.243
- WHY DON'TgI-CTU ASK HER?

12:31.280 --> 12:33.214
- WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T HOOK
HER UP TO A POLYGRAPH MACHINE,

12:33.250 --> 12:35.047
BECAUSE YOU'RE
NOT GONNA GET ANYWHERE.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.844
- YOU HOOKED HER UP
TO A LIE DETECTOR,

12:37.890 --> 12:39.517
AND YOU WANT THE NEW PARTNER?

12:39.550 --> 12:42.110
- CHIEF, THERE IS SOMETHING
I NEED TO COME CLEAN ABOUT.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.787
- OH, YOU'RE GONNA COME CLEAN
TO HER?

12:43.830 --> 12:46.355
- WAIT, DOES IT AFFECT
YOUR ABILITY TO DO YOUR JOB

12:46.390 --> 12:47.425
RIGHT NOW?
- NO.

12:47.460 --> 12:49.928
- THEN WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT I WOULD WANT TO KNOW?

12:49.970 --> 12:52.461
WHAT I DO WANT
IS FOR THE TWO OF YOU

12:52.500 --> 12:54.092
TO WORK OUT WHATEVER SILLINESS
IS GOING ON

12:54.140 --> 12:55.129
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

12:55.170 --> 12:58.105
I'VE GOT A BRIEFING
TO GIVE.

12:58.140 --> 13:02.804
THE VICTIM
WAS ANNABETH YORK, 31,

13:02.850 --> 13:03.748
A MEMBER

13:03.780 --> 13:06.078
OF AMBASSADOR FANSHAWE'S
TECHNICAL STAFF.

13:06.110 --> 13:08.249
NOW, SHE'D BEEN STAYING
IN THE SANTA BARBARA AREA,

13:08.280 --> 13:10.282
WORKING WITH A DIPLOMATIC TEAM

13:10.320 --> 13:12.914
ON BEHALF OF A JAILED
BRITISH EXCHANGE STUDENT,

13:12.960 --> 13:14.552
COLIN HENNESSEY,

13:14.590 --> 13:16.455
ACCUSED OF STRANGLING

13:16.490 --> 13:18.378
HIS THEN-GIRLFRIEND,
SARAH PEELE,

13:18.430 --> 13:22.594
BASED ON WITNESS TESTIMONY
OF SEEING HIM DRIVING HIS CAR,

13:22.630 --> 13:26.191
A 2010 RED CHEW CRUZE,
FROM THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.

13:26.230 --> 13:29.028
NOW, STAY WITH ME
BECAUSE NOW IT GETS GOOD.

13:29.070 --> 13:31.959
TEN DAYS AGO, MISS YORK
SUCCESSFULLY LOCATED

13:32.010 --> 13:34.274
ANOTHER WITNESS
PUTTING MR. HENNESSEY

13:34.310 --> 13:37.108
FAR FROM THE CRIME,
GIVING HIM AN ALIBI

13:37.150 --> 13:39.300
AND EARNING HIM HIS RELEASE

13:39.350 --> 13:41.375
AND THE DROPPING
OF ALL CHARGES.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.583
NOW, THE PARTY WAS A FAREWELL
TO THE AMBASSADOR

13:44.620 --> 13:47.259
AND A THANK-YOU FOR THE CLEARING
OF AN INNOCENT MAN.

13:47.290 --> 13:49.884
THIS CASE WAS BROUGHT
TO OUR ATTENTION

13:49.930 --> 13:54.492
BY PERHAPS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE
BIT OF PREMONITION YET

13:54.530 --> 13:55.599
FROM MR. SPENCER HERE.

13:55.630 --> 13:57.268
HE NOT ONLY KNEW
THE ADDRESS,

13:57.300 --> 13:58.528
BUT THE INITIAL LOCATION,

13:58.570 --> 14:00.629
THE JEWELRY
THAT THE VICTIM WAS WEARING,

14:00.670 --> 14:03.059
AND ALSO THAT THE PARTY PUNCH
WAS A BIT SKUNKY.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.066
SO, MR. SPENCER,

14:05.110 --> 14:06.259
STRONG WORK.

14:06.310 --> 14:07.436
- DO WE HAVE A SUSPECT?

14:07.480 --> 14:11.507
- SECURITY CHASED AN INTRUDER
FROM AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.576
- THAT WASN'T THE GUY.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.178
THAT WAS PROBABLY
JUST A PAPARAZZI.

14:17.220 --> 14:18.539
- OR A RACCOON.
- THOUGH A RACCOON

14:18.590 --> 14:20.387
WITH A VIDEO CAMERA
WOULD BE AN IDEAL SUSPECT.

14:20.420 --> 14:21.409
- HMM.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.657
- A QUICK WORD.
- NO, THANKS.

14:24.690 --> 14:26.248
CAN GUS COME?
- I DON'T WANT TO COME.

14:26.290 --> 14:29.896
- SHAWN.
- MISS YORK WAS HIGHLY TRUSTED,

14:29.930 --> 14:33.263
DESPITE BEING THE LOWEST-RANKING
MEMBER OF THE DIPLOMATIC TEAM.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.029
- COME ON, DAD.

14:35.070 --> 14:36.537
I WANTED TO HEAR
THE REST OF THAT BRIEFING,

14:36.570 --> 14:37.434
SEE HOW IT ENDED.

14:37.470 --> 14:39.358
- YOU WERE IN THAT HOUSE,
WEREN'T YOU?

14:39.410 --> 14:41.674
- I MAY HAVE BEEN
UNDER THE BED.

14:41.710 --> 14:44.099
I HAD TO HIDE FROM THE GUARDS.
THAT'S WHERE I SAW THE GIRL.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.447
- YOU BROKE IN.
- I SNUCK IN.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.675
- YOU CRASHED
A DIPLOMAT'S PARTY.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.984
- I WAS ONLY THERE TO STEAL
DARTH VADER FROM HIS KID'S ROOM.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.580
- KID, YOU'RE GONNA GET CAUGHT.

14:52.620 --> 14:54.679
YOU'RE GONNA BLOW
YOUR WHOLE PSYCHIC THING,

14:54.720 --> 14:58.087
AND YOU'RE GONNA BECOME
THE PRIME SUSPECT.

14:58.130 --> 15:01.588
- WAS HIGHLY TRUSTED, DESPITE
BEING THE LOWEST-RANKING MEMBER

15:01.630 --> 15:03.461
OF THE DIPLOMATIC TEAM.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.092
- I AM SENSING THE VICTIM.

15:05.130 --> 15:08.566
SHE WAS WEARING NEW EARRINGS,
GLITTERY GOWN, SLEEVELESS.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.306
HERE'S MY QUESTION.

15:10.340 --> 15:12.558
IF THIS IS SUCH
A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT

15:12.610 --> 15:15.170
THAT THE AMBASSADOR FLEW IN
AND RENTED A HOUSE

15:15.210 --> 15:17.178
IN SANTA BARBARA TO OVERSEE
THE WHOLE THING,

15:17.210 --> 15:18.507
THEN WHY WAS IT PASSED OFF

15:18.550 --> 15:23.112
TO THE LOWEST-RANKING MEMBER
OF HIS STAFF?

15:23.150 --> 15:25.380
I THINK THE AMBASSADOR
WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR

15:25.420 --> 15:27.308
WITH THE VICTIM.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.352
[door creaks]

15:42.740 --> 15:44.332
- COME TO VISIT
THE STIFFS?

15:44.370 --> 15:46.258
- WHAT? NO.

15:46.310 --> 15:49.108
- IT'S OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND YOUR FASCINATION.

15:49.140 --> 15:51.643
IT'S COMPLETELY NATURAL.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.568
THE URGE TO COMB THEIR HAIR,

15:53.620 --> 15:55.144
TRY ON THEIR JEWELRY.
- WOODY.

15:55.180 --> 15:57.444
WOODY, I SNUCK IN HERE

15:57.490 --> 15:59.640
TO TAKE A PEEK
AT YOUR PRELIMINARY REPORT

15:59.690 --> 16:02.215
BEFORE YOU PRESENT
TO THE OTHER COPS TOMORROW.

16:02.260 --> 16:03.625
- YOU DIDN'T KILL HER,
DID YOU?

16:03.660 --> 16:04.820
- NO.
MY SON NEEDS MY HELP.

16:04.860 --> 16:07.522
I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE BIT OFF
A BIT TOO MUCH THIS TIME.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.551
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.
I KNOW GUS WELL.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.521
- SHAWN.
- HIM TOO.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.130
NEVER THOUGHT OF THEM
AS BROTHERS, THOUGH.

16:13.170 --> 16:14.728
BIT OF A GAME-CHANGER,
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

16:14.770 --> 16:16.567
- LOOK, HE'S IN A PINCH.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.602
HE NEEDS TO SOLVE
THIS CASE FIRST.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.107
- SAY NO MORE.

16:23.580 --> 16:26.003
- THE PROBLEM, SHAWN, IS THAT
WE KNOW THEY WERE HOOKING UP,

16:26.050 --> 16:29.247
BUT WITHOUT ACCESS
TO THE AMBASSADOR, WE'RE STUCK.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.542
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'LL HANDLE IT?

16:30.590 --> 16:33.616
NO.

16:33.660 --> 16:38.324
- YOU NEED TO PICK A SIDE.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.624
- SHE HAS LITTLE
TO NO DEFENSIVE WOUNDS.

16:40.660 --> 16:43.458
- SO SHE KNEW HER ATTACKER?
- OR SHE PAID SOMEBODY

16:43.500 --> 16:44.660
TO MURDER HER.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.725
NOW THAT I SAY THAT OUT LOUD,
I LIKE YOUR THEORY BETTER.

16:46.770 --> 16:49.432
BUT THAT'S
NOT EVEN THE BIG REVEAL.

16:49.470 --> 16:51.461
SHE WAS STRANGLED
IN A VERY SIMILAR FASHION--

16:51.510 --> 16:53.307
- WHY IS THERE
A SECOND AUTOPSY REPORT HERE?

16:53.340 --> 16:55.774
- I REMEMBER THE IDENTICAL
CIRCUMSTANCES OCCURRING

16:55.810 --> 16:57.641
IN THAT STUDENT'S MURDER
LAST YEAR.

16:57.680 --> 17:00.240
THEY ACCUSED A BRIT.
- COLIN HENNESSEY.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.111
THAT'S THE CASE THIS WOMAN
WAS WORKING ON.

17:02.150 --> 17:04.209
- I KNOW, RIGHT?
I PULLED OUT THE REPORT.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.684
THE STRANGULATION MARKS
ARE A MATCH.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.609
- SO THESE MURDERS WERE
COMMITTED BY THE SAME PERSON?

17:09.660 --> 17:10.786
- I WAS THINKING
REPLICATE ROBOTS,

17:10.830 --> 17:13.628
BUT NOW THAT I SAY IT OUT LOUD,
I LIKE YOUR IDEA BETTER.

17:13.660 --> 17:17.096
I MAY EVEN HAVE
A PRINT ON THE BODY.

17:17.130 --> 17:18.461
- WOODY, FAVOR.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.138
- DOES IT INVOLVE SLEEPING
OVER NIGHT IN THE COOLER?

17:20.170 --> 17:21.592
- NO.
- THEN ANYTHING.

17:21.640 --> 17:22.595
- DON'T HURRY.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.632
- I NEVER DO.

17:28.780 --> 17:31.806
- SO IT'S SOMEONE THAT WAS
HERE NOW AND LAST MAY 16TH?

17:31.850 --> 17:33.715
- YEAH, YEAH.
IF WOODY IS RIGHT.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.116
DID YOU GET BACK INTO
THE AMBASSADOR'S HOUSE YET?

17:36.150 --> 17:37.481
- YEAH,
I'M NEGOTIATING THAT NOW.

17:37.520 --> 17:38.817
BYE.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.078
- I'M NOT APOLOGIZING TO HIM.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.587
- FINE. YOU APOLOGIZE.

17:41.620 --> 17:43.451
- I'VE NOTHING
TO APOLOGIZE FOR.

17:43.490 --> 17:45.481
- YOU BEGGED TO BORROW
MY TELESCOPING VADER,

17:45.530 --> 17:47.157
THEN REFUSED TO RETURN IT.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.849
- I CAN'T EVEN FIND
THE STUPID TOY.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.561
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT
YOU CAN'T.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.329
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHY.

17:52.370 --> 17:55.396
- JUSTIN, YOUR GOOD PAL MASON
HERE TAKES OFF FOR ENGLAND

17:55.440 --> 17:57.601
ON FRIDAY.
- I'M GOING BACK TO NEW YORK,

17:57.640 --> 17:58.607
YOU MORON.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.631
THE EMBASSY IS IN NEW YORK.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.240
IF WE WERE IN ENGLAND,
WE WOULDN'T BE AMBASSADORS,

18:03.280 --> 18:04.406
YOU TWIT.

18:04.450 --> 18:05.644
- LET ME HIT HIM.
- RIGHT IN THE FACE.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.874
- YES, THAT'S
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

18:06.910 --> 18:08.343
- HIT HIM IN THE FACE.
WAIT.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.642
- WHAT?
- CAN'T.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.841
I DON'T THINK IMMUNITY WORKS
IN THAT DIRECTION.

18:11.890 --> 18:13.687
- CAN WE GO NOW?

18:13.720 --> 18:15.517
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO BE MY FRIEND ANYWAY.

18:15.560 --> 18:16.788
I JUST WANTED
TO USE HIS POOL.

18:16.820 --> 18:19.186
- OH, WELL,
YOU'LL NEVER USE IT NOW.

18:19.230 --> 18:21.494
- YES, I WILL, BECAUSE
I'M GONNA BECOME FRIENDS

18:21.530 --> 18:23.725
WITH THE NEXT FAMILY
THAT RENTS THAT PLACE.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.624
AND THEN I'M GOING TO
PRACTICALLY LIVE IN THAT POOL.

18:25.670 --> 18:27.661
- WELL, I'M GOING
TO GO PEE IN IT.

18:27.700 --> 18:29.895
- DON'T FORGET TO SIT DOWN
WHEN YOU DO IT, YOU GIRL.

18:29.940 --> 18:31.669
- HAVE FUN SWIMMING IN MY PEE.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.632
- OKAY, NO ONE'S PEEING
IN ANYTHING.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.534
- EXCEPT FOR YOU
IN YOUR BED, YOU WANKER.

18:35.580 --> 18:37.207
- OKAY, THAT'S IT.
I'M GONNA BEAT YOUR POMPOUS--

18:37.250 --> 18:38.649
- YOU CAN'T. NO.
- WHAT?

18:38.680 --> 18:40.841
- GUS, WE CAN'T ARGUE
LIKE THIS

18:40.880 --> 18:42.609
WITH CHILDREN.

18:42.650 --> 18:45.312
I CALLED US ALL TOGETHER BECAUSE
WE NEED TO HAVE A SUMMIT,

18:45.350 --> 18:46.214
LIKE GENTLEMEN.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.615
WE NEED TO DO IT
IN YOUR KITCHEN, MASON.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.252
WE NEED TO DO IT
BEFORE YOUR DAD GETS HOME.

18:49.290 --> 18:51.258
- WHOA, WHY MY HOUSE?
- BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE

18:51.290 --> 18:52.621
THAT STARTED ALL THIS.
- BY STEALING MY STUFF.

18:52.660 --> 18:53.752
- I DIDN'T EVEN LIKE IT.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.688
THE NEW STAR WARS MOVIES

18:55.730 --> 18:57.618
ARE WAY BETTER
THAN THE OLDER ONES, ANYWAY.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.888
- WHOA.
- NO, IT'S NOT. WHATEVER.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.761
- WE ARE DEALING
WITH A CRAZY PERSON.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.564
I TOLD YOU
THIS WASN'T GONNA WORK.

19:04.610 --> 19:07.534
YOU STOLE A KEY
FROM A KID?

19:07.580 --> 19:09.901
- COME ON, GUS,
THAT WAS NO KID.

19:09.940 --> 19:13.649
IT'S THE PRODUCT OF CENTURIES
OF INBREEDING.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.387
[crunching]
- DO I HEAR POTATO CHIPS?

19:22.420 --> 19:24.388
- I THINK THEY'RE CALLED
"CRISPS" IN THIS HOUSE, GUS.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.454
AND, YES, YOU DO.

19:25.490 --> 19:27.594
- YOU RAIDED
THE MINI FRIDGE AGAIN?

19:27.630 --> 19:29.621
- BE REASONABLE.
CHIPS DON'T GO IN THE FRIDGE.

19:29.660 --> 19:32.458
BUT THIS CAN
OF SPRITE ZERO DOES.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.866
- DUDE, PUT IT AWAY.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.209
[drawer opens]

19:37.240 --> 19:40.334
- HMM.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.632
WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

19:51.650 --> 19:53.356
[beeping]

19:53.390 --> 19:57.656
- ACCUSED OF STRANGLING HIS
THEN-GIRLFRIEND, SARAH PEELE.

19:57.690 --> 20:00.557
- SO IT WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS HERE
NOW AND LAST MAY 16TH?

20:00.600 --> 20:01.794
- YEAH, YEAH,
IF WOODY IS RIGHT.

20:01.830 --> 20:03.866
- HMM.

20:10.310 --> 20:14.337
- RANDA, I'VE COME
TO A DECISION.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.910
I'VE DECIDED THAT I'M GOING
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

20:20.950 --> 20:22.611
I'M GOING TO COME CLEAN.

20:22.650 --> 20:25.380
- ADMITTING AN AFFAIR
TO THE AMERICAN POLICE

20:25.420 --> 20:27.308
WILL CAUSE THEM
TO INVESTIGATE YOU.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.817
- EVERYONE KNOWS
THAT MY WIFE AND I WERE SPLIT

20:29.860 --> 20:31.487
WAY BEFORE MY APPOINTMENT.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.294
LOOK, I'VE GOT NOTHING
TO HIDE.

20:34.330 --> 20:35.991
- YOU'RE TOO TRUSTING.

20:36.030 --> 20:37.668
IF YOU DON'T LISTEN
TO ME, RICHARD,

20:37.700 --> 20:39.463
YOU WILL BE BROUGHT DOWN
FOR THIS.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.731
- NOT UNLESS WE CAN FIND SOMEONE
TO BE ON OUR SIDE,

20:42.770 --> 20:44.806
SOMEONE LIKE THAT PSYCHIC

20:44.840 --> 20:46.899
WHO CAN FIND
THE TRUTH FOR US.

20:46.940 --> 20:48.578
- ARE YOU LISTENING
TO YOURSELF?

20:48.610 --> 20:50.669
- OH, COME ON, DON'T TELL ME
YOU WEREN'T MESMERIZED

20:50.710 --> 20:52.541
BY THAT MIND-BOGGLING DISPLAY.

20:52.580 --> 20:55.777
I MEAN, I NEARLY GOT UP
AND CHEERED MYSELF.

20:55.820 --> 20:58.345
- SHAWN, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

20:58.390 --> 20:59.414
NO.

20:59.450 --> 21:00.781
NO. NO.

21:00.820 --> 21:03.550
[doorbell rings]

21:03.590 --> 21:06.423
- SPIRITS ARE STIRRING.
I SENSE I WAS NEEDED.

21:06.460 --> 21:08.849
- WE'VE HAD JUST ABOUT ENOUGH
OF YOU, MR. SPENCER.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.697
- LET'S GO, SHAWN.
- I WAS DRAWN HERE.

21:10.730 --> 21:11.890
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

21:11.930 --> 21:13.659
PLEASE, HELP ME FIND OUT.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.861
- SHALL I RING THE POLICE?

21:15.900 --> 21:17.765
- OH.

21:19.010 --> 21:22.309
WELL, THAT...
IS ASTOUNDING.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.347
PLEASE, COME IN.

21:29.420 --> 21:30.978
I'D LIKE TO HIRE YOU.

21:31.020 --> 21:32.647
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
- WHY?

21:32.690 --> 21:34.510
- WE THINK YOU DID IT.
- WE DO NOT.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.652
- WE DID BEFORE.
- DUDE, THAT WAS,

21:35.690 --> 21:37.783
LIKE, HALF AN HOUR AGO.
- WHY DID WE CHANGE OUR MIND?

21:37.830 --> 21:40.856
- AMBASSADOR, LAST MAY 16TH,
YOU WERE IN A STRANGE

21:40.900 --> 21:42.856
AND FANTASTICAL PLACE
CALLED ZOO-RICH.

21:42.900 --> 21:44.390
- ZURICH.
- SO THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY

21:44.430 --> 21:45.988
YOU COULD HAVE KILLED
SARAH PEELE.

21:46.030 --> 21:47.588
- OF COURSE I DIDN'T.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.631
- I'M ALSO SENSING THAT YOU
CARED DEEPLY FOR ANNABETH.

21:49.670 --> 21:50.659
- WE ARE PAID

21:50.710 --> 21:52.507
BY THE SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT, SHAWN.

21:52.540 --> 21:54.508
- [snickers]
AMBASSADOR, GO AHEAD.

21:54.540 --> 21:56.098
TELL HIM
ABOUT ALL THE BENEFITS

21:56.140 --> 21:58.074
THAT GO ALONG WITH WORKING
FOR YOU--STATE DINNERS,

21:58.110 --> 21:59.941
BEER PONG
WITH PRINCE HARRY,

21:59.980 --> 22:01.516
MANSCAPING WITH CHARLES,

22:01.550 --> 22:03.814
CORAL REEF BOMBING
WITH THE QUEEN.

22:03.850 --> 22:05.738
- I THINK YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

22:05.790 --> 22:07.781
- AM I?
OH.

22:07.820 --> 22:09.356
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION

22:09.390 --> 22:13.827
THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME KIND
OF DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY.

22:13.860 --> 22:15.725
- OH, I SEE.
WELL, NO, IT'S TRUE

22:15.760 --> 22:17.796
THAT ALL MEMBERS
OF MY STAFF ARE PERMITTED

22:17.830 --> 22:19.718
LIMITED POWERS OF IMMUNITY.

22:19.770 --> 22:21.590
- CAN I ROB A BANK?
- NO.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.130
- CAN I PRINT I‘IQBOWN MONEY?

22:23.170 --> 22:25.502
- CAN YOU INTRODUCE ME
TO HARRY POTTER?

22:25.540 --> 22:26.700
- FICTIONAL CHARACTER.

22:26.740 --> 22:28.139
- CAN I URINATE
ON A PUBLIC BUS?

22:28.180 --> 22:29.772
- WOULD YOU WANT TO?
- MAYBE.

22:29.810 --> 22:31.846
- SHAWN.
- DEPENDS ON THE BUS COMPANY.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.677
CAN I DRIVE
180 MILES PER HOUR?

22:33.720 --> 22:36.075
- LOOK, I THINK
THIS IS ALL A BIG MISTAKE.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.439
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
SCRATCH THAT.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.741
THE BLUEBERRY
CAN ONLY DO, WHAT, 60?

22:38.790 --> 22:42.851
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL GET YOU
A LIST OF EXCEPTIONS.

22:42.890 --> 22:44.118
CHEERS.
YOU'RE HIRED.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.822
- GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

22:46.860 --> 22:49.124
DUDE, I JUST GOT US
DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY.

22:49.160 --> 22:52.618
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO STEAL?

22:59.770 --> 23:01.408
- OKAY.

23:01.440 --> 23:02.930
WHY DO YOU NEED US,
MR. AMBASSADOR?

23:02.980 --> 23:04.845
- LOOK, ANNABETH WAS TRYING
TO CONTACT ME

23:04.880 --> 23:06.404
THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY.

23:06.450 --> 23:07.439
- DID SHE SAY
WHAT SHE WANTED?

23:07.480 --> 23:08.845
- ONLY THAT IT WAS
ABOUT THE CASE,

23:08.880 --> 23:10.416
THAT IT WAS URGENT.

23:10.450 --> 23:13.010
SHE SENT ME A CRYPTIC TEXT.
HERE...

23:13.050 --> 23:14.881
"THE WITNESSES WERE RIGHT."

23:14.920 --> 23:16.057
- RIGHT ABOUT WHAT?

23:16.090 --> 23:17.887
SHE'D JUST PROVEN
THEY WERE WRONG.

23:17.930 --> 23:21.752
- AMBASSADOR, I'LL NEED A MOMENT
TO EVALUATE YOUR WOOD.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.428
- HERE YOU GO.
- OH. THANK YOU.

23:24.470 --> 23:26.791
- OH.

23:38.210 --> 23:40.713
[British accent]
WHERE ARE YOUR SHOES?

23:40.750 --> 23:44.208
- IS THAT YOUR BRITISH ACCENT?

23:44.250 --> 23:47.117
WHERE ARE YOU GETTING
YOUR ACCENTS FROM?

23:47.150 --> 23:49.209
- [normal voice] I DON'T KNOW.
ALL THE USUAL PLACES I GUESS--

23:49.260 --> 23:53.048
PETER PAN, GEICO GECKO,
PHINEAS AND FERB'S GRANDDAD.

23:53.090 --> 23:54.591
- IS THERE ANY OF THEM
THAT DON'T COME

23:54.630 --> 23:55.927
FROM ANIMATED CHARACTERS?

23:55.960 --> 23:58.599
- NOT REALLY.
DOES RUSSELL BRAND COUNT?

23:58.630 --> 23:59.767
- GUYS, SERIOUSLY.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.030
THE SHOES--
WHERE ARE THEY?

24:02.070 --> 24:04.129
- WHY?
I DON'T KEEP MY SHOES HERE.

24:08.610 --> 24:10.237
- THEY WEREN'T JUST SHOES.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.544
THE MURDERER WAS IN THE ROOM.
- WHEN?

24:12.580 --> 24:15.970
- WHEN THE GUARDS CAME IN
AND CHASED AWAY THE INTRUDER.

24:16.020 --> 24:17.612
- I THOUGHT THE KILLER
WAS THE INTRUDER.

24:17.650 --> 24:19.015
- NO. NO, NO. NO.

24:19.050 --> 24:20.711
JUST--HE INTRUDER HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE MURDER.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.853
FORGET ABOUT HIM...
OR HER, OR IT,

24:22.890 --> 24:23.925
IF IT'S TRANSGENDER.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.258
- HE MEANS THE KILLER
WAS A GUEST AT THE PARTY.

24:26.290 --> 24:28.622
- IF THEY MOVED THE BODY
WITHOUT ANYONE SEEING,

24:28.660 --> 24:30.764
THEY WERE PROBABLY THE LAST
TO LEAVE.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.688
- WHO WAS THAT?

24:32.730 --> 24:35.096
- I KNOW I LEFT MY JACKET
ON THE CHAIR.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.199
GOD, I HAD MY WALLET
IN THE POCKET.

24:37.240 --> 24:40.676
- COLIN HENNESSEY--
A 2010 RED CHEW CRUZE.

24:40.710 --> 24:42.200
- COLIN HENNESSEY.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.845
- THE KID ANNABETH JUST CLEARED
OF MURDERING HIS GIRLFRIEND?

24:44.880 --> 24:46.199
- "THE WITNESSES WERE RIGHT"

24:46.250 --> 24:48.878
THE FIRST TIME IMPLIES
SHE KNEW HE WAS GUILTY.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.184
- SO HE HAD TO KILL HER BEFORE
SHE COULD TELL ANYONE ELSE.

24:51.220 --> 24:55.156
- AMBASSADOR,
WE'LL NEED AN ADDRESS.

24:57.190 --> 24:58.987
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:59.030 --> 25:01.157
- IMMUNITY DOESN'T COVER
TRESPASSING, SHAWN.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.952
- SPENCER, GET BACK OUT HERE.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.820
- YOU GUYS STAY OUT THERE.

25:04.870 --> 25:07.862
[clicking tongue]

25:14.740 --> 25:17.038
THAT'S TOO STICKY.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.285
- I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.208
THIS TIME, I SWEAR TO GOD,
I'M REALLY GONNA KILL HIM.

25:26.250 --> 25:28.081
- CARLTON,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA KILL ANYONE.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.155
- I MIGHT.

25:33.230 --> 25:34.959
[glass squeaks]

26:04.690 --> 26:07.659
- MAY I HELP YOU?
- COLIN.

26:07.700 --> 26:12.069
- COLIN IS A 21-YEAR-OLD
UNIVERSITY STUDENT.

26:12.100 --> 26:13.192
- AH, SO YOU'RE NOT HIM.

26:13.230 --> 26:16.734
- WE'RE HIS HOST FAMILY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOME?

26:16.770 --> 26:18.203
- WELL, I WORK
FOR AMBASSADOR FANSHAWE,

26:18.240 --> 26:20.060
AND I HAVE
DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY.

26:20.110 --> 26:21.771
- S0 DO I.
- REALLY?

26:21.810 --> 26:23.778
THEY JUST HAND THAT OUT
LIKE HALLOWEEN CANDY, HUH?

26:23.810 --> 26:25.675
- I'M HIS PUBLIC AFFAIRS
OFFICER.

26:25.710 --> 26:28.178
AND IMMUNITY

26:28.220 --> 26:30.814
IS A VERY LIMITED SCOPE
OF POWERS.

26:30.850 --> 26:32.738
- [laughs]
MAYBE FOR YOU.

26:32.790 --> 26:35.679
I PRETTY MUCH HAVE
THE FULL MONTY.

26:35.720 --> 26:38.052
- S.B.P.D.
- MAY WE PLEASE COME IN, SIR?

26:38.090 --> 26:40.149
WE NEED TO ASK COLIN
A FEW QUESTIONS.

26:40.190 --> 26:43.318
- YES, OF COURSE.
IS HE IN SOME SORT OF TROUBLE?

26:43.360 --> 26:45.225
- WELL, HE WAS
THE LAST GUEST TO LEAVE

26:45.270 --> 26:46.897
THE AM BASSADOR'S PARTY
THE OTHER NIGHT,

26:46.930 --> 26:48.238
AND WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
THE VICTIM'S BODY

26:48.270 --> 26:49.794
WAS MOVED LATE IN THE EVENING.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.205
- WE ALSO HAVE EVIDENCE
THAT ANNABETH YORK

26:51.240 --> 26:53.902
HAD NEW INFORMATION
REGARDING HIS CASE.

26:53.940 --> 26:55.771
- WE DO?
- I DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT?

26:55.810 --> 26:57.175
[cell phone vibrating]
YEAH.

26:57.210 --> 26:59.371
YEAH, I DIVINED
THAT SHE WAS KILLED

26:59.410 --> 27:01.173
BECAUSE SHE WAS VERY CLOSE
TO IDENTIFYING THE MURDERER.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.369
- THANKS FOR SHARING, SPENCER.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.638
MAN, YOU REALLY PUT
THE "ME" IN TEAM.

27:04.690 --> 27:07.682
- COLIN HAS BEEN A MODEL GUEST
IN OUR HOME.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.859
HE'S JUST RESUMED CLASSES TODAY.

27:09.890 --> 27:12.188
I THOUGHT
THIS AWFUL MATTER WAS OVER.

27:12.230 --> 27:15.154
- IT IS. WE JUST GOT
A FINGERPRINT OFF THE BODY--

27:15.200 --> 27:17.225
AND A MATCH, AND WE'RE GOING
TO MAKE AN ARREST.

27:17.260 --> 27:20.161
- THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.105
- THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS.

27:27.140 --> 27:29.233
- LOOK, I AM STRONGLY SENSING
IT'S NOT HER.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.009
- HER DNA
WAS ALL OVER THE BODY.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.678
- AND SHE IMMEDIATELY
INVOKED IMMUNITY.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.176
- YOU'D USE IT
IF YOU COULD GET IT.

27:35.220 --> 27:37.814
IT'S MORE ADDICT IVE
THAN LITTLE CRACK NUGGETS.

27:37.850 --> 27:39.181
- AND
HOUSE HUNTERS INTERNATIONAL.

27:39.220 --> 27:41.188
- WHY DON'T YOU LET US TALK
TO HER, ALONE?

27:41.220 --> 27:45.725
- YOU MOVED THE BODY?

27:45.760 --> 27:48.194
- I DID IT FOR YOU.
- GOD.

27:48.230 --> 27:50.221
- MY JOB
IS TO PROTECT YOU,

27:50.260 --> 27:52.728
AND H THOUGHT
THAT YOU KILLED HER.

27:52.770 --> 27:55.739
I MEAN, IT--
IT WAS YOUR BEDROOM, RICHARD.

27:55.770 --> 27:57.909
- LOOK, I'LL DO
EVERYTHING I CAN,

27:57.940 --> 28:00.135
BUT YOUR IMMUNITY'S
NOT GONNA HELP YOU.

28:00.170 --> 28:03.105
I MEAN, THE MISSION ARE GONNA
BACK THE AMERICANS ON THIS ONE.

28:03.140 --> 28:07.201
- THAT WOMAN WEARS LOYALTY
LIKE A MICRO MINI SKIRT.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.877
- WHAT?

28:08.920 --> 28:10.785
- THAT WOMAN WEARS LOYALTY

28:10.820 --> 28:12.310
LIKE A MI--
- WAIT A MINUTE.

28:12.350 --> 28:15.080
- FROM HIS HOST FAMILY
WHO'VE STOOD

28:15.120 --> 28:16.951
BY HIM THIS WHOLE TIME.

28:16.990 --> 28:20.027
- THERE'S NO WAY SHE COULD HAVE
BEEN IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE.

28:20.060 --> 28:22.096
I THINK WE HAD THE RIGHT KILLER
ALL ALONG.

28:22.130 --> 28:24.860
YOU CAN THANK US LATER.
- ESPECIALLY ME.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.035
[tires screeching]

28:35.410 --> 28:37.298
- THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT.

28:37.340 --> 28:38.409
YOU'RE NOT DRIVING ANYMORE.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.202
- OH, COME ON, GUS.
WE'VE ALMOST SOLVED THE CASE.

28:40.250 --> 28:42.377
WE GOT TO ENJOY IMMUNITY
BEFORE IT'S GONE.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.081
- THAT'S YOUR IDEA OF FUN?

28:44.120 --> 28:46.247
- YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S STRANGELY EMPTY.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.781
MAYBE WE NEED TO AMP UP
THE THRILL.

28:54.030 --> 28:56.749
- LET'S JUST GO, SHAWN.
WE'RE NOT GONNA FIND HIM HERE.

28:56.800 --> 28:59.291
- GUS, DON'T BE
THE MYSTERY MOUSEKETOOL.

29:00.970 --> 29:02.289
HEY, FREEZE!

29:02.340 --> 29:04.137
SHAWN SPENCER,

29:04.170 --> 29:06.502
HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE
AND S.B.P.D.!

29:08.980 --> 29:10.277
HE'S GETTING AWAY.

29:10.310 --> 29:13.199
GUS, HELP ME FIGURE OUT
WHICH ONE OF THESE CARS

29:13.250 --> 29:14.911
TO COMMANDEER.
- WHAT?

29:14.950 --> 29:17.839
- WHOA!

29:17.890 --> 29:19.084
- WHAT IS THAT?

29:19.120 --> 29:21.259
- THESE ARE MY DIPLOMAT PAPERS.

29:21.290 --> 29:24.179
- THAT IS A WHICHWICH SANDWICH
STAMP CARD.

29:24.230 --> 29:25.458
- THAT'S MY WHICHWICH
STAMP CARD.

29:25.490 --> 29:27.321
- WHICHWICH IS 90 MILES AWAY.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.225
- IT DOESN'T MATTER, SHAWN.
- IT IS THE BACK OF A STAMP CARD

29:29.260 --> 29:32.229
THAT SAYS, "YOU WORK FOR ME."
SIGNED, RICHARD FANSHAWE.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.965
AND I DON'T THINK I NEED
TO TELL YOU WHO HE IS.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.558
- YES, YOU DO.
- HE'S AN AMBASSADOR, JACK,

29:37.300 --> 29:38.562
AND NO ONE CAN SAY A WORD,
ESPECIALLY YOU,

29:38.610 --> 29:39.565
'CAUSE YOU'D BE DEAD.

29:39.610 --> 29:41.339
NOW, I'M NOT GONNA DO IT,

29:41.380 --> 29:42.506
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO DO
THE QUEEN THAT WAY,

29:42.540 --> 29:45.100
NOT AFTER ALL THE MESSES
PRINCE ANDREW'S GOTTEN US INTO.

29:45.150 --> 29:46.299
[tires squealing]

29:48.880 --> 29:50.438
COME ON, MAN, JUST TURN
THE ENGINE BACK ON.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.482
LET'S GO GET HIM.
- THE ENGINE IS ON.

29:52.520 --> 29:56.308
- REALLY?
THESE PRIUSES ARE SUPER QUIET.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.328
- I AM NOT GIVING YOU
MY CAR.

30:01.130 --> 30:02.995
- HOLD UP!
[tires screeching]

30:04.300 --> 30:06.962
[siren chirps]

30:07.000 --> 30:09.491
IF YOU'RE SO INNOCENT,
THEN WHY DID YOU RUN?

30:09.540 --> 30:12.304
- I SPENT FOUR MONTHS IN JAIL
WRONGLY ACCUSED.

30:12.340 --> 30:13.204
I GOT SCARED.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.207
- WE JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU, DUDE.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.333
- THEN WHY WERE YOU SHOUTING,
"I'LL SHOOT YOU

30:16.380 --> 30:19.099
REPEATEDLY IN THE SKULL
WHEN I CATCH YOU"?

30:19.150 --> 30:21.311
- THAT WAS ME.
I WAS GONNA SHOOT HIM.

30:21.350 --> 30:22.578
ONLY I DON'T HAVE A GUN.

30:22.620 --> 30:25.384
IT'S JUST A STRESS-RELIEF
FANTASY THAT I HAVE.

30:25.420 --> 30:28.082
IT'S PERFECT LY NORMAL.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.384
- FREE TO GO.

30:30.420 --> 30:32.627
- THANK YOU.
- NOT YOU, HIM.

30:32.660 --> 30:36.289
47 VIOLATIONS, AND YOU NEVER
EVEN MADE IT INTO A CAR--

30:36.330 --> 30:38.127
SOLID WORK, SPENCER.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.263
- I HAVE TWO WORDS
FOR YOU, LASSIE.

30:40.300 --> 30:44.600
[Russian accent]
DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.232
WHAT, AM I SAYING THIS WRONG?

30:46.270 --> 30:48.500
- THE GUY FROM LETHAL WEAPON 2
WAS NOT RUSSIAN, SHAWN.

30:48.540 --> 30:49.939
- IT'S BEEN REVOKED.

30:49.980 --> 30:52.403
JUST GOT THAT
FROM THE AMBASSADOR.

30:52.450 --> 30:54.611
- IN MY DEFENSE,
I NEVER RECEIVED THE PAMPHLET

30:54.650 --> 30:55.844
OUTLINING THE LIMITATIONS.

30:55.880 --> 30:58.519
ALL I KNOW IS WHAT I SAW
IN AN OLD CHiPS EPISODE.

30:58.550 --> 31:00.541
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOUR ANTICS
AT THE COLLEGE.

31:00.590 --> 31:04.219
I THINK HE WAS A TAD MORE UPSET
ABOUT THIS.

31:06.960 --> 31:09.622
SO, PSYCHIC...

31:09.660 --> 31:12.128
PLEASE EXPLAIN.

31:25.450 --> 31:27.873
- THIS...

31:30.220 --> 31:32.688
IS NOT ME.

31:32.720 --> 31:33.516
- SHAWN.

31:33.550 --> 31:36.257
WHEN LASSITER SHOWED ME
THE PICTURE,

31:36.290 --> 31:39.054
I SAID, "WHERE DID YOU GET
THAT PICTURE OF SHAWN?"

31:39.090 --> 31:42.025
- LOOK, I WISH IT WERE ME,
IF I'M BEING HONEST.

31:42.060 --> 31:44.199
THE GUY LOOKS GREAT
IN A SUIT.

31:44.230 --> 31:45.561
THE HEAD'S ALL WRONG.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.467
AND HIS HAIR HAS
A COUNTER-CLOCKWISE TREND TO IT.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.934
MINE'S ALWAYS GROWN
NORTHERN HEMISPHERE.

31:50.970 --> 31:53.530
- I DON'T SEE IT.
- SOUTH AFRICAN.

31:53.570 --> 31:56.209
THE LETHAL WEAPON 2 GUYS
ARE SOUTH AFRICAN.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.003
AND THIS...

31:58.050 --> 32:00.507
IS NOT ME.

32:00.550 --> 32:03.940
- MM.

32:03.990 --> 32:08.017
I GUESS THERE'S JUST ONE WAY
TO SETTLE THIS.

32:09.990 --> 32:12.185
- OKAY, REALLY?
JULES, COME ON.

32:12.230 --> 32:14.198
WILL YOU TELL HIM
TO PLEASE STOP THIS?

32:14.230 --> 32:15.356
- WHY?

32:15.400 --> 32:17.356
- BECAUSE IT'S WRONG.
THAT'S WHY.

32:17.400 --> 32:20.665
- LOOK, SURE, I LOOK
A LOT LIKE THIS GUY.

32:20.700 --> 32:22.634
BUT IT--IT'S A FAX.

32:22.670 --> 32:25.059
IT'S BLURRY.
IT'S FROM THE SIDE.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.737
WHO WOULD EVEN SEND
THIS PICTURE?

32:26.770 --> 32:29.000
- I'M SORRY, SHAWN.
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN WITH THIS.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.270
- FIRST QUESTION--

32:31.310 --> 32:33.073
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

32:33.110 --> 32:35.340
- THERE IS A MURDERER
ON THE LOOSE.

32:35.380 --> 32:37.177
- THAT IS NOT YOUR NAME.

32:39.390 --> 32:42.382
- SHAWN SPENCER.

32:42.420 --> 32:44.627
- TRUTH.
WE'RE OFF TO A GOOD START.

32:44.660 --> 32:47.379
- WHERE WERE YOU
THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY?

32:47.430 --> 32:49.591
- LET'S SEE, UH...

32:51.370 --> 32:54.259
I TALKED WITH GUS...

32:54.300 --> 32:56.461
PLAYED SOME VIDEO GAMES.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.661
[electronic game beeping]

32:58.710 --> 33:01.634
YEAH, WE WERE--WE WERE TALKING
A LITTLE STAR WARS.

33:06.780 --> 33:09.078
LOOK, LASSIE, WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.212
THIS IS ABOUT ME AND JULIET.

33:10.250 --> 33:11.581
- ANSWER ONLY
MY QUESTIONS, PLEASE.

33:11.620 --> 33:13.144
- YES, WE'RE TOGETHER.

33:13.190 --> 33:14.487
YOU HATE IT. I GET IT.
- SPENCER.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.317
- I CAN'T HELP IT, MAN.
I'VE BEEN FIGHTING

33:16.360 --> 33:17.759
THIS THING FOR YEARS.
- SPENCER, STOP.

33:17.790 --> 33:18.779
- IT'S NOT JUST GONNA GO AWAY.
- STOP.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.058
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL

33:20.090 --> 33:22.354
WITH THE FACT
THAT I LOVE HER, OKAY?

33:34.210 --> 33:36.531
[scoffs] ALL RIGHT.
CAN I GET OUT OF HERE?

33:36.580 --> 33:38.241
I'VE JUST
ABOUT SOLVED THIS CASE.

33:38.280 --> 33:41.317
- ONE MORE QUESTION.
- IF IT WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY.

33:41.350 --> 33:44.114
- I THINK IT WILL.

33:44.150 --> 33:45.515
- [sighs]

33:45.550 --> 33:46.642
- ARE YOU PSYCHIC?

33:46.690 --> 33:48.658
- EXCUSE ME?

33:48.690 --> 33:53.627
- ARE YOU,
SHAWN SPENCER, PSYCHIC?

34:01.400 --> 34:05.609
- YOU HAVE TO ANSWER
THAT ONE, SHAWN.

34:28.260 --> 34:29.818
- YES.

34:39.170 --> 34:41.730
- NO DECEPTION INDICATED.

34:41.780 --> 34:44.374
- JUST H-HOLD IT.
I REPEAT, ARE YOU PSYCHIC?

34:44.410 --> 34:46.298
- YES, I AM.
- A PERSON OF PSYCHIC ABILITY?

34:46.350 --> 34:47.840
- I AM.
- WITH THE ABILITY TO SEE

34:47.880 --> 34:49.541
INTO THE FUTURE?
- I AM. I'M SO PSYCHIC,

34:49.580 --> 34:51.309
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT.
WANT TO TRY IT IN SPANISH?

34:51.350 --> 34:53.784
SI. MUCHO CLARIVIDENTE.

34:53.820 --> 34:55.117
ESTOY SIN PIERNAS.

34:55.160 --> 34:56.718
- YOU JUST SAID
THAT YOU WERE LEGLESS.

34:56.760 --> 34:59.752
- YOU'RE LEGLESS.
THIS IS NOT ME.

34:59.790 --> 35:02.327
THIS IS A GUY
WITH SIMILAR HAIR

35:02.360 --> 35:04.396
AND NO IDEA
HOW TO STYLE IT.

35:04.430 --> 35:07.263
- OKAY, I THINK WE'VE HEARD
ABOUT ENOUGH OF THIS, CARLTON.

35:12.340 --> 35:14.706
[glass squeaks]

35:14.740 --> 35:17.709
- OH, AND I KNOW
WHO KILLED THAT WOMAN,

35:17.740 --> 35:19.799
IF ANYONE'S INTERESTED.

35:22.580 --> 35:23.649
[doorbell rings]

35:23.680 --> 35:26.240
- THE LEAST YOU COULD DO
IS GIVE US AN EXPLANATION.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.689
- YOU WOULDN'T NEED ONE
IF YOU'D KEEP YOUR CRIMINALS

35:27.720 --> 35:29.551
IN THE CELL A LITTLE LONGER.

35:29.590 --> 35:32.320
- WHAT'S GOING ON, GUYS?

35:32.360 --> 35:35.193
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME, COLIN?

35:38.270 --> 35:40.488
- THE PHOTO THAT WAS FAXED
TO THE AMBASSADOR

35:40.530 --> 35:42.737
CAME FROM THIS HOUSE,
WHICH GOT ME TO THINKING,

35:42.770 --> 35:47.639
"WHO STANDS TO BENEFIT THE MOST
FROM DISCREDITING ME?"

35:47.670 --> 35:49.706
- THE CORRECT ANSWER
IS THE KILLER.

35:49.740 --> 35:51.708
- ANNABETH WAS MY SAVIOR.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.570
SHE FOUND THE WITNESS
THAT CLEARED ME.

35:53.610 --> 35:55.441
WHY WOULD I DO ANYTHING
TO HARM HER?

35:55.480 --> 35:56.879
- MAYBE SHE REALIZED
SHE WAS WRONG

35:56.920 --> 35:58.740
AND YOU ACTUALLY WERE GUILTY.

35:58.790 --> 36:01.418
- BUT SHE WASN'T WRONG,
WAS SHE?

36:01.460 --> 36:03.314
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

36:03.360 --> 36:04.759
- CHARLES AND I
ARE OLD FRIENDS.

36:19.340 --> 36:22.275
- I SEE YOU!

36:22.310 --> 36:23.709
I SENSE YOU, WIGNALL,

36:23.740 --> 36:25.344
AT THE PARTY,
IN THE CLOSET,

36:25.380 --> 36:27.268
HIDING AFTER YOU STRANGLED
ANNABETH YORK.

36:27.310 --> 36:30.438
ANNABETH CAME TO YOU
AT THE PARTY.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.744
SHE HAD NEWS, BUT COULDN'T GET
A HOLD OF THE AMBASSADOR.

36:32.790 --> 36:35.509
- SENT ME A CRYPTIC TEXT.

36:35.560 --> 36:38.381
"THE WITNESSES WERE RIGHT."

36:38.430 --> 36:40.227
- SHE HAD TO TELL
SOMEONE SHE KNEW,

36:40.260 --> 36:42.990
SOMEONE SHE WORKED WITH,
PERHAPS AN OLD FRIEND.

36:43.030 --> 36:45.521
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU REALIZED
THAT SHE WAS VERY CLOSE

36:45.570 --> 36:49.597
TO DISCOVERING THAT COLIN
WAS IMPRISONED

36:49.640 --> 36:52.529
FOR DOING SOMETHING
THAT YOU WERE GUILTY OF.

36:52.570 --> 36:55.778
YOU HAD TO KILL HER
TO KEEP HER QUIET.

36:55.810 --> 36:57.277
- CHARLES, TELL ME
THAT ISN'T TRUE.

36:57.310 --> 36:58.470
- I DIDN'T.

36:58.510 --> 37:01.741
- ANNABETH KNEW THE WITNESSES
WERE RIGHT ABOUT THE CAR.

37:01.780 --> 37:03.418
THEY WERE JUST WRONG
ABOUT THE DRIVER.

37:03.450 --> 37:04.849
YOU HAD ACCESS
TO COLIN'S KEYS.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.643
AND YOU HAD A CREEPY FASCINATION
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.

37:07.690 --> 37:09.817
- I BARELY KNEW
WHO SHE WAS.

37:09.860 --> 37:11.452
- WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

37:11.490 --> 37:13.583
SARAH MENTIONED THAT YOU'D
CALLED HER ON HER MOBILE

37:13.630 --> 37:14.756
MORE THAN ONCE.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.427
EVENTUALLY SHE WOULDN'T COME
OVER HERE.

37:16.460 --> 37:17.893
SHE ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET
AT HER PLACE.

37:17.930 --> 37:19.625
I DIDN'T KNOW WHY,
BUT NOW IT MAKES SENSE.

37:19.670 --> 37:21.991
- DON'T START POINTING
THE FINGER AT ME

37:22.040 --> 37:25.430
BECAUSE OF THIS LUNATIC,
WHO'S CLEARLY A FAKE.

37:25.470 --> 37:27.734
- OH.

37:27.770 --> 37:31.501
I AM SENSING
THAT YOU, COLIN, MISPLACED

37:31.550 --> 37:33.677
A COLLECTION
OF VOYEURISTIC PHOTOS.

37:33.710 --> 37:36.747
BUT...
[gasps] WAIT.

37:36.780 --> 37:38.816
LUCKILY,
MRS. WIGNALL FOUND THEM

37:38.850 --> 37:40.647
FOR YOU.

37:40.690 --> 37:43.579
SPIRITUAL CORRECTION
INCOMING.

37:43.620 --> 37:46.828
ARE THESE EVEN YOURS?

37:51.770 --> 37:54.330
- I'VE NEVER SEEN THESE BEFORE.
- ARE YOU SURE?

37:54.370 --> 37:55.894
- I'M IN THEM.

37:55.940 --> 37:59.933
- IT'S VERY EASY
TO MISTAKE SOMEONE IN A PHOTO.

37:59.970 --> 38:02.803
- LOOK, THAT'S MY SHIRT.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.341
- WELL...

38:04.380 --> 38:07.747
IF THEY'RE NOT YOURS,
THEN WHO COULD THEY POSSIBLY--

38:07.780 --> 38:09.077
OH.

38:09.120 --> 38:13.819
I'M GETTING SOMETHING VERY DARK
AND VERY "WIGNALLIAN."

38:17.620 --> 38:18.723
- RICHARD, TELL THEM.

38:18.760 --> 38:21.820
- LOOK, YOU'VE HAD YOUR ISSUES
WITH YOUNG WOMEN BEFORE.

38:21.860 --> 38:24.658
- YOU, SIR,
STRANGLED ANNABETH YORK,

38:24.700 --> 38:27.328
AND, YOU, SIR, STRANGLED
SARAH PEELE.

38:27.370 --> 38:28.962
- SHE WAS A LIAR--

38:29.000 --> 38:31.707
A MAD, LITTLE...

38:35.740 --> 38:38.072
I DON'T HAVE TO STAND
FOR THIS QUESTIONING.

38:38.110 --> 38:41.511
I WORK WITH THE AMBASSADOR,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

38:41.550 --> 38:43.541
I'VE GOT DIP--
- KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

38:43.580 --> 38:46.481
YOU'RE FIRED.

38:47.790 --> 38:50.384
- SIR, PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

38:52.390 --> 38:54.893
- I KNOW HOW YOU KNOW.

38:54.930 --> 38:57.353
- SO YOU'RE PLEADING
GUILTY, THEN?

38:57.400 --> 39:00.460
[handcuffs clicking]

39:12.010 --> 39:14.069
- NOW, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE
I CAN'T HOLD ON TO MY TITLE,

39:14.110 --> 39:15.748
JUST TILL APRIL 16TH?

39:15.780 --> 39:17.611
- YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY TAXES,
YOU KNOW, SHAWN.

39:17.650 --> 39:18.947
- YEAH, BUT I CAN PAY
BRITISH TAXES,

39:18.990 --> 39:20.639
WHICH ARE PROBABLY
WAY CHEAPER, RIGHT?

39:20.690 --> 39:23.853
- OH, YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THE U.K., DO YOU?

39:23.890 --> 39:26.688
- JUST THE GOOD STUFF--
MORRISSEY, GWYNETH PALTROW,

39:26.730 --> 39:29.392
LEPRECHAUNS...
- I'M GONNA MISS YOU, SHAWN.

39:29.430 --> 39:31.091
- OH, YOU KNOW, YOU EVER NEED ME
AT THE EMBASSY,

39:31.130 --> 39:32.927
I'M RIGHT HERE.
- THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

39:32.970 --> 39:34.528
THANK YOU.

39:34.570 --> 39:37.437
- AMBASSADOR, I HAVE--
I HAVE ONE LAST VISION.

39:37.470 --> 39:38.960
IT'S ABOUT YOUR SON.

39:39.010 --> 39:43.071
HE'S IN DANGER, I'M AFRAID--
SERIOUS DANGER

39:43.110 --> 39:45.999
OF, WELL,
BECOMING A REAL A-HOLE.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.745
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE A PSYCHIC

39:47.780 --> 39:50.169
TO KNOW THAT,
BUT THANK YOU.

39:50.220 --> 39:51.687
I APPRECIATE IT.

39:51.720 --> 39:52.982
MM. OOH.

39:53.020 --> 39:54.453
YES.

39:54.490 --> 39:57.414
YOU AMERICANS
ARE SO EMOTIONAL.

39:57.460 --> 40:01.157
UM, COULD YOU BRING THE BAGS?
- OF COURSE.

40:01.190 --> 40:04.489
[clatter, glass breaks]

40:09.500 --> 40:13.800
- SHOULD WE TALK
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY?

40:13.840 --> 40:16.138
- NO.
NO, NO.

40:16.180 --> 40:17.829
NOT REALLY.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.508
- SPENCER, MAY I HAVE A WORD?

40:20.550 --> 40:22.472
O'HARA.

40:29.620 --> 40:31.451
- WHAT--
OH, COME ON, LASSIE,

40:31.490 --> 40:33.526
WE'RE NOT REALLY GONNA DO THIS
AGAIN, ARE WE?

40:33.560 --> 40:35.755
- I'VE KNOWN YOU
FOR SIX YEARS, SPENCER.

40:35.800 --> 40:36.994
I KNOW YOUR ACT.

40:37.030 --> 40:38.793
YOU DO YOUR LITTLE DANCE,

40:38.830 --> 40:40.764
YOU BEAT POLYGRAPH MACHINES.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.529
YOU ALWAYS MANAGE TO GUESS
THE RIGHT CULPRIT

40:42.570 --> 40:44.458
AFTER MISSING THE FIRST FOUR
OR FIVE TIMES.

40:44.510 --> 40:46.535
YOU WHIP THAT HAIR AROUND

40:46.570 --> 40:50.131
AND FALL
OVER EVERY REASONABLE GIRL

40:50.180 --> 40:51.943
THAT GUSTER HASN'T
UNSUCCESSFULLY HIT ON ALREADY.

40:51.980 --> 40:55.768
AND NOW YOU'VE MADE YOUR WAY
TO O'HARA.

40:55.820 --> 40:57.811
- WHAT--OH, COME ON.
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

40:57.850 --> 41:01.081
- WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,

41:01.120 --> 41:03.486
YOU OUTED MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH MY FORMER PARTNER--

41:03.520 --> 41:05.784
A GIRL I REALLY LIKED,
BY THE WAY.

41:05.830 --> 41:06.979
GOT HER TRANSFERRED.

41:07.030 --> 41:09.828
THAT DOESN'T MATTER NOW.

41:09.860 --> 41:13.762
MY POINT IS...
[inhales deeply]

41:13.800 --> 41:17.497
IF YOU DON'T TREAT O'HARA
WITH THE RESPECT SHE DESERVES

41:17.540 --> 41:20.008
OR IF YOU HURT HER
IN ANY WAY,

41:20.040 --> 41:22.270
I WILL DISCHARGE MY PISTOL.

41:22.310 --> 41:24.198
- YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'LL SHOOT ME?

41:24.240 --> 41:26.242
- REPEATEDLY.

41:36.720 --> 41:40.781
- THE ANSWER IS...

41:40.830 --> 41:43.151
NO.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.667
- WRONG AGAIN.

41:44.700 --> 41:46.827
SHAWN, I KNEW
YOU WERE LYING.

41:46.870 --> 41:49.088
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THE LIE.

41:49.140 --> 41:52.200
DON'T SWEAT.
FEEL YOUR HEART.

41:52.240 --> 41:54.731
- DAD, THIS--THIS FEELS
A LITTLE UNETHICAL.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.270
- TRUST ME, SHAWN,
THERE WILL COME A DAY,

41:56.310 --> 41:57.937
UNFORTUNATELY,
WHEN THIS MIGHT BE NECESSARY.

41:57.980 --> 41:59.868
PERHAPS YOU'LL BE WORKING
UNDERCOVER...

41:59.910 --> 42:01.844
BUT MOST LIKELY NOT.

42:01.880 --> 42:06.647
NOW, ANSWER THE QUESTION AGAIN,
BUT THIS TIME, FIRST...
