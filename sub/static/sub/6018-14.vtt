00:30.397 --> 00:31.955
Oh, hi.

00:32.131 --> 00:34.293
A hundred episodes.

00:34.768 --> 00:38.602
That's a lot. During the course of
which George, Elaine, Kramer and I...

00:38.772 --> 00:42.902
...have had many experiences,
both positive and negative.

00:43.076 --> 00:44.839
Well, mostly negative.

00:45.011 --> 00:47.605
There've been some relationships
that haven't worked out...

00:47.781 --> 00:49.578
...ambitions that were unfulfilled...

00:49.749 --> 00:51.808
...hopes dashed...

00:51.985 --> 00:54.180
...some property damage,
hurt feelings....

00:54.354 --> 00:56.345
I know one guy got deported.

00:56.523 --> 00:58.218
Physical injury and....

00:58.425 --> 01:00.689
All right, maybe even
a death or two.

01:00.860 --> 01:02.327
But we've persevered.

01:02.495 --> 01:04.486
Because we're people.

01:04.664 --> 01:06.461
Real TV people.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.533
And for 30 minutes a week...

01:08.701 --> 01:10.601
...that's pretty important to us.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.397
So if you're joining us late...

01:12.572 --> 01:15.336
...here's some highlights
from what's happened so far.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.337
Why don't they have salsa
on the table?

01:18.244 --> 01:19.768
What do you need salsa for?

01:19.946 --> 01:22.915
Salsa is now the number-one
condiment in America.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.482
Do you know why?

01:24.651 --> 01:26.346
Because people like to say "salsa."

01:28.521 --> 01:29.749
Do you have any salsa?

01:29.923 --> 01:32.687
We need more salsa.
Where is the salsa? No salsa?

01:33.426 --> 01:36.054
You know, it must be impossible
for a Spanish person...

01:36.229 --> 01:38.254
...to order seltzer and not get salsa.

01:39.666 --> 01:42.260
I wanted seltzer, not salsa.

01:42.535 --> 01:44.526
Don't you know the difference
between them?

01:44.704 --> 01:47.104
You have the seltzer after the salsa.

01:47.974 --> 01:50.738
This should be the show.
This is the show.

01:51.244 --> 01:52.836
-What?
-This.

01:53.012 --> 01:54.843
Just talking.

01:55.014 --> 01:56.948
Yeah. Right.

01:59.052 --> 02:01.782
No, I'm really serious.
I think that's a good idea.

02:02.088 --> 02:04.386
Just talking?
Well, what's the show about?

02:04.891 --> 02:05.880
It's about nothing.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.720
What's that red dot
on your sweater?

02:10.497 --> 02:12.988
Hey, didn't we come in over there?

02:13.833 --> 02:16.529
I thought we came in over there.

02:17.904 --> 02:19.963
I'm out.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.071
-What?
-Yeah, I'm out.

02:28.248 --> 02:30.239
I'm out of the contest.

02:31.751 --> 02:34.083
-No story?
-No, forget the story.

02:34.254 --> 02:37.018
-You gotta have a story.
-Who says you gotta have a story?

02:50.270 --> 02:51.999
Four. Seinfeld.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.400
Four.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.507
That'll be five, 10 minutes.

02:55.675 --> 02:56.972
What, do you smell something?

02:57.143 --> 02:59.737
Do I smell something?
What am I, hard of smelling?

02:59.913 --> 03:01.278
What is it?

03:01.447 --> 03:03.438
I think its BO.

03:03.616 --> 03:06.176
And who's on the show?
Who are the characters?

03:06.386 --> 03:07.853
I could be a character.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.418
-You?
-Yeah. You base a character on me.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.659
It's come to my attention
that you and the cleaning woman...

03:13.826 --> 03:17.728
...have engaged in sexual intercourse
on the desk in your office.

03:22.001 --> 03:24.231
-Who said that?
-She did.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.467
Was that wrong?

03:28.241 --> 03:30.436
Should I not have done that?

03:30.610 --> 03:32.441
I got to plead ignorance
on this thing...

03:32.612 --> 03:34.807
...because if anyone
had said anything to me...

03:34.981 --> 03:38.917
...when I first started here that that
sort of thing was frowned upon....

03:40.553 --> 03:42.180
And who else is on the show?

03:42.488 --> 03:43.819
Elaine could be a character.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.416
I wonder what happened
to my fiancé.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.327
I know he's here somewhere.

03:49.495 --> 03:53.955
I have lost my fiancé,
the poor baby.

03:56.536 --> 03:58.629
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.697
What?

04:01.908 --> 04:04.934
The dingo ate your baby.

04:05.845 --> 04:09.008
-Kramer.
-Now, he's a character.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.412
The bus is out of control.

04:12.952 --> 04:15.420
So I grab him by the collar,
take him out of the seat...

04:15.588 --> 04:18.284
...get behind the wheel.
Now I'm driving the bus.

04:20.192 --> 04:22.787
-You're Batman.
-Yeah. I am Batman.

04:22.962 --> 04:25.931
Then the mugger, he comes to,
and he starts choking me.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.930
So I'm fighting him off
with one hand...

04:28.101 --> 04:30.899
...and I kept driving the bus
with the other, you know?

04:31.070 --> 04:33.937
Then I managed to open the door
and kicked him out the door...

04:34.107 --> 04:36.598
...with my foot, you know,
at the next stop.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.971
You kept making all the stops?

04:39.579 --> 04:41.479
Well, people kept ringing the bell!

04:43.616 --> 04:45.049
So everybody I know...

04:45.218 --> 04:47.209
-...is a character on the show.
-Right.

04:47.387 --> 04:50.356
My wallet's gone! My wallet's gone!

04:50.523 --> 04:52.582
-Jerry.
-Uncle Leo.

04:52.759 --> 04:54.021
Hello.

04:54.193 --> 04:55.421
How could you?

04:55.595 --> 04:57.563
-How could I what?
-You were making out...

04:57.730 --> 04:59.891
...during <i>Schindler's List</i> ?

05:00.500 --> 05:02.491
How long does it take to find a bra?

05:02.902 --> 05:04.494
What's going on in there?

05:04.671 --> 05:08.038
You ask me to get a pair of
underwear, I'm back in two seconds.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.970
You know about the cup sizes
and all?

05:14.180 --> 05:18.378
-They have different cups.
-Yeah, I know about the cups.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.316
You got the A...

05:21.587 --> 05:22.815
...the B...

05:22.989 --> 05:24.923
...the C...

05:25.091 --> 05:27.559
...the D. That's the biggest.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.388
I go out for a quart of milk.

05:29.562 --> 05:32.156
I come home and find
my son treating his body...

05:32.332 --> 05:34.994
...like it was an amusement park.

05:36.703 --> 05:39.035
I'm a United States postal worker.

05:40.239 --> 05:42.264
Aren't those the guys
that always go crazy...

05:42.442 --> 05:44.740
...and come back with a gun
and shoot everybody?

05:45.278 --> 05:47.109
Sometimes.

05:47.980 --> 05:51.040
-Why is that?
-Because the mail never stops.

05:51.217 --> 05:54.015
Every day it piles up more and more
and you gotta get it out...

05:54.187 --> 05:55.620
...but more keeps coming in!

05:55.788 --> 05:59.053
Then the bar code reader breaks,
and it's Publishers Clearing House day!

05:59.225 --> 06:00.783
All right, all right, all right.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.190
So you're saying I go into NBC
and tell them...

06:03.363 --> 06:05.695
...I got this idea
for a show about nothing.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.389
We go into NBC.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.864
We? Since when are you a writer?

06:10.069 --> 06:12.765
What writer?
We're talking about a sitcom.

06:15.241 --> 06:16.731
You wanna go with me to NBC?

06:16.909 --> 06:18.467
Yeah, we really got something here.

06:18.644 --> 06:19.872
-What do we got?
-An idea.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.071
-What idea?
-An idea for the show.

06:22.248 --> 06:25.911
-I still don't know what the idea is.
-It's about nothing.

06:26.252 --> 06:28.083
-Right.
-Everybody's doing something.

06:28.254 --> 06:30.051
We'll do nothing.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.056
Come on. Let's go do something.
I don't want to just sit around here.

06:33.259 --> 06:35.124
-Wanna get something to eat?
-Where?

06:35.294 --> 06:36.921
I don't care. I'm not hungry.

06:38.698 --> 06:40.689
We could go to one of those
cappuccino places.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.528
They let you just sit there.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.169
What are we gonna do there, talk?

06:45.738 --> 06:46.966
We can talk.

06:47.774 --> 06:49.799
I'll go if I don't have to talk.

06:51.544 --> 06:52.772
Then we'll just sit there.

06:52.945 --> 06:56.779
Oh, that's the astronaut pen. I heard
about that. Where did you get it?

06:57.316 --> 07:00.342
-It was a gift.
-Because a lot of times I write in bed...

07:00.520 --> 07:03.648
...and I have to turn and lean on
my elbow to make the pen work.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.282
-Take the pen.
-Oh, no.

07:07.493 --> 07:08.517
-Go ahead.
-I couldn't.

07:08.694 --> 07:10.025
-Take it.
-I can't take it.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.187
-Do me a personal favor.
-I'm not comfortable.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.333
-I cannot take it.
-Take the pen.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.663
-Are you sure?
-I'm positive. Take the pen.

07:18.271 --> 07:22.173
Okay, thank you very much.
Thank you. Gee, boy.

07:22.341 --> 07:23.933
-Jack, what are you doing?
-Stop it.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.203
Jack, we should go.

07:28.414 --> 07:30.575
It was nice meeting you.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.308
-Nice to meet you.
-Thanks again.

07:32.552 --> 07:33.541
Come on!

07:37.857 --> 07:39.757
-This?
-Yeah.

07:40.993 --> 07:43.723
-I agreed to wear this?
-Yeah, yeah.

07:45.064 --> 07:46.395
Well, when did I do that?

07:46.566 --> 07:48.796
When we went to dinner
the other night.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.902
What, are you crazy?

07:51.370 --> 07:53.702
What were you talking about
when I went to the bathroom?

07:53.873 --> 07:56.171
I don't know.
I couldn't understand a word she said.

07:56.342 --> 07:58.708
-I was just nodding.
-There you go.

07:59.445 --> 08:00.673
Where I go?

08:00.847 --> 08:03.509
You mean she was asking me
to wear this ridiculous shirt...

08:03.683 --> 08:07.210
-...on national TV, and I said yes?
-Yes, yes. You said it.

08:07.386 --> 08:10.150
I didn't know what she was
talking about. I couldn't hear her.

08:10.323 --> 08:15.454
-Well, she asked you.
-I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.895
I mean, look at it. It looks ridiculous.

08:18.264 --> 08:19.925
Well, you gotta wear it now.

08:20.099 --> 08:22.226
This pirate trend
she's come up with, Jerry....

08:22.401 --> 08:24.301
This is gonna be
the new look for the '90s.

08:24.470 --> 08:26.370
You're gonna be the first pirate.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.871
But I don't wanna be a pirate.

08:29.041 --> 08:31.202
I made a reservation.
Do you have my reservation?

08:31.377 --> 08:34.244
Yes, we do.
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.378
But the reservation
keeps the car here.

08:37.549 --> 08:39.711
That's why you have
the reservation.

08:39.952 --> 08:44.013
-I know why we have reservations.
-I don't think you do.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.158
If you did, I'd have a car.

08:50.329 --> 08:52.263
See, you know how to take
the reservation.

08:52.431 --> 08:55.867
You just don't know how to hold
the reservation.

08:56.035 --> 09:01.200
And that's really the most important
part of the reservation, the holding.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.604
Anybody can just take them.

09:10.750 --> 09:14.447
I think I can sum up the show
for you with one word:

09:15.955 --> 09:18.014
Nothing.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.819
-Nothing?
-Nothing.

09:20.993 --> 09:22.017
What does that mean?

09:22.194 --> 09:23.855
What did you do today?

09:24.030 --> 09:26.624
-I got up and came to work.
-There's a show. That's a show.

09:28.334 --> 09:29.961
How is that a show?

09:30.136 --> 09:32.661
Well, maybe something happens
to you on the way to work.

09:32.838 --> 09:35.966
No. No! No! Nothing happens!

09:36.142 --> 09:38.167
Well, something happens.

09:38.344 --> 09:41.472
-Well, why am I watching it?
-Because it's on TV.

09:42.348 --> 09:43.872
Not yet.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.757
I'm telling you, she's good-looking.

10:03.869 --> 10:06.167
-What about the body?
-Good body. Nice body.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.466
-How nice?
-Nice. Pretty nice.

10:08.641 --> 10:12.543
-Really good?
-Really, very nice and good.

10:17.683 --> 10:20.174
-What about personality?
-Good personality.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.523
Funny. Bright.

10:24.690 --> 10:26.681
I don't want anyone
smarter than me.

10:26.859 --> 10:29.794
How could she
be smarter than you?

10:30.296 --> 10:34.164
He's a really, really funny guy.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.862
What does he look like?

10:36.035 --> 10:39.232
-Pardon?
-What does he look like?

10:40.439 --> 10:43.636
Well, he's got a lot of character
in his face.

10:43.809 --> 10:46.869
He's short. He's stocky.

10:47.046 --> 10:48.308
He's fat.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.312
Is that what you're saying,
that he's fat?

10:50.549 --> 10:51.982
Powerful.

10:52.151 --> 10:57.987
He is so powerful. He can lift
100 pounds right up over his head.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.352
And, what else? What else?

11:00.526 --> 11:03.495
Oh, right, well....

11:03.663 --> 11:07.827
He's, he's kind of--
Just kind of-- Losing his hair.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.491
-He's bald?
-No.

11:11.203 --> 11:14.138
No, no, no. He's not bald.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.297
He's balding.

11:16.475 --> 11:19.171
-So he will be bald?
-Yeah.

11:19.912 --> 11:22.005
Thick, lustrous hair
is important to me.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.088
"Thick, lustrous hair
is important to me."

11:31.257 --> 11:32.690
-Is that what you said?
-Right.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.382
Just clarifying.

11:35.561 --> 11:37.552
Let me ask you this.

11:42.329 --> 11:45.764
If you stick your hand in the hair,
is it easier to get it out?

11:49.942 --> 11:51.432
Do you want to get it out?

11:51.610 --> 11:54.204
Or do you want to not be able
to get it out?

11:54.714 --> 11:57.774
-I'd like to be able to get it out.
-I think you'll get it out.

11:58.684 --> 12:00.083
What about the skin?

12:00.252 --> 12:02.083
I need a good cheek.
I like a good cheek.

12:03.189 --> 12:04.451
She's got a fine cheek.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.953
Is there a pinkish hue?

12:09.895 --> 12:13.991
-A pinkish hue?
-Yes, a rosy glow.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.828
There's a hue.

12:17.670 --> 12:21.106
She's got great eyebrows.
Women kill to have her eyebrows.

12:22.975 --> 12:25.205
Who cares about eyebrows?

12:25.845 --> 12:27.779
Look at you.

12:27.947 --> 12:30.711
Why don't you do something
with your life?

12:30.883 --> 12:34.979
You sit around here all day.
You contribute nothing to society!

12:35.154 --> 12:38.612
The alarm didn't go off.
You're gonna miss the plane, it's 9:15.

12:38.791 --> 12:42.192
-9:15?
-Yeah. It's 9:15!

12:42.361 --> 12:44.192
We'll never make it.
I'll leave tomorrow.

12:44.363 --> 12:47.230
Tomorrow? Are you crazy?
No. Now, now, let's go.

12:47.399 --> 12:49.299
Let's go. You get dressed,
you get dressed.

12:49.468 --> 12:52.699
I mean, how can I be
with someone like you?

12:54.273 --> 12:56.002
Wouldn't respect myself.

12:56.175 --> 12:57.403
Put your pants on.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.874
-I'll go tomorrow or the next day.
-You have your ticket.

13:00.045 --> 13:01.706
-You have to go now.
-We'll never make it.

13:01.881 --> 13:05.476
-Don't say that.
-Well, it takes 45 minutes to get--

13:06.152 --> 13:09.121
It takes 45 minutes to get there.
That only leaves me five minutes...

13:09.288 --> 13:11.483
-...to get to the plane.
-Shut up and pack!

13:11.657 --> 13:13.716
I take it all back!
Every word!

13:13.893 --> 13:15.884
I love you!

13:16.595 --> 13:19.120
I love you!

13:19.298 --> 13:21.357
It's not you. It's me.

13:22.168 --> 13:25.001
You're giving me
the "it's not you, it's me" routine?

13:26.539 --> 13:31.135
I invented "it's not you, it's me."
Nobody tells me it's them, not me.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.006
-lf it's anybody, it's me.
-All right.

13:34.180 --> 13:37.479
-George, it's you.
-You are damn right it's me.

13:38.050 --> 13:41.781
Elaine, you don't know the first thing
about first base.

13:42.855 --> 13:46.484
Well, I know something
about getting to first base...

13:46.659 --> 13:49.093
...and I know you'll never be there.

13:49.728 --> 13:51.821
The way I figure it,
I've already been there.

13:51.997 --> 13:55.023
And I plan on rounding second
tonight at around 11:00.

13:56.602 --> 14:00.436
Well, I'd watch the third-base coach
if I were you...

14:00.606 --> 14:03.598
...because I don't think
he's waving you in.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.670
I guess things changed for me
on Tuesday night.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.509
Tuesday night?
What happened Tuesday night?

14:11.450 --> 14:13.509
I saw your act.

14:14.453 --> 14:16.853
My act? What does that
have to do with anything?

14:17.022 --> 14:18.887
Well, to be honest...

14:19.058 --> 14:21.151
...it just didn't make it for me.

14:21.327 --> 14:23.887
It's just so much fluff.

14:24.430 --> 14:27.126
What are you saying?
You didn't like my act?

14:27.299 --> 14:28.527
So that's it?

14:28.701 --> 14:32.102
I can't be with someone
if I don't respect what they do.

14:32.271 --> 14:34.102
You're a cashier.

14:34.273 --> 14:36.138
You don't know my name, do you?

14:37.543 --> 14:40.341
-Yes, I do.
-What is it?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.747
It rhymes with a female body part.

14:43.916 --> 14:45.850
What is it?

14:47.286 --> 14:49.311
Mulva?

14:50.256 --> 14:54.090
-I think you're really sick.
-I'm not sick.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.285
You said much sicker things
than me.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.157
I'm leaving.

14:58.330 --> 14:59.558
So where were we?

14:59.732 --> 15:02.860
-I was just leaving.
-Right. You were leaving.

15:03.035 --> 15:05.868
I can't believe you sent a woman
into the sauna to do that?

15:06.038 --> 15:08.006
That was an accident.

15:08.173 --> 15:10.733
I think you're both mentally ill.

15:18.350 --> 15:23.185
And by the way, they're real
and they're spectacular.

15:24.523 --> 15:26.286
Why shouldn't we
be able to do that...

15:26.458 --> 15:28.517
-...once in a while if we want to?
-I know.

15:28.694 --> 15:31.128
I mean, really, what is the big deal?

15:31.297 --> 15:32.594
We go in there...

15:32.765 --> 15:36.462
...we're in there for a while,
then we come back out here.

15:36.669 --> 15:37.931
That's not complicated.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.333
It's almost stupid if we didn't.

15:40.506 --> 15:43.566
-It's moronic.
-Absurd.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.439
Course...

15:48.614 --> 15:52.448
...I guess maybe some little
problems could arise.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.210
There are always a few.

15:54.386 --> 15:56.217
I mean, if anything happened...

15:56.388 --> 16:00.848
...and we couldn't be friends the way
we are now, that would really be bad.

16:01.026 --> 16:05.258
-Devastating.
-Because this is very good.

16:07.399 --> 16:09.333
And that would be good.

16:09.501 --> 16:11.696
That would be good too.

16:12.438 --> 16:15.339
The idea is to combine the this...

16:15.507 --> 16:17.532
...and the that.

16:17.843 --> 16:20.311
But this cannot be disturbed.

16:20.479 --> 16:23.243
Yeah, we just want to take this...

16:23.415 --> 16:26.612
...and add that.

16:29.521 --> 16:32.149
But of course, we'd have
to figure out a way...

16:32.324 --> 16:35.225
...to avoid the things that
cause the little problems.

16:35.394 --> 16:38.591
Maybe some rules or something.

16:38.764 --> 16:40.595
For example:

16:41.567 --> 16:44.764
Now I call you whenever
I'm inclined, and vice versa.

16:44.937 --> 16:48.373
But if we did that, we might feel...

16:48.540 --> 16:50.064
...a certain obligation to call.

16:50.876 --> 16:52.935
Well, why should that be?

16:53.679 --> 16:55.772
I have an idea.

16:55.948 --> 17:00.078
No calls the day after that.

17:00.252 --> 17:01.549
Beautiful.

17:01.720 --> 17:02.948
Let's make it a rule.

17:03.122 --> 17:04.817
All right, sir.

17:07.626 --> 17:10.492
-Now, here's another little rule.
-Yeah.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.329
When we see each other now...

17:12.498 --> 17:14.590
...we retire to our separate quarters.

17:14.767 --> 17:18.099
But sometimes when people
get involved with that...

17:18.270 --> 17:20.500
...they feel pressure...

17:20.672 --> 17:23.435
...to sleep over.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.372
When that...

17:25.544 --> 17:27.239
...is not really sleep.

17:29.782 --> 17:33.843
Sleep is separate from that,
and I don't see...

17:34.019 --> 17:39.787
...why sleep got all tied up
and connected...

17:39.958 --> 17:41.448
...with that.

17:41.660 --> 17:47.565
Okay, okay, rule number two:
Spending the night is optional.

17:49.668 --> 17:52.102
Well, now we're getting somewhere.

17:52.304 --> 17:54.738
I slept with Elaine last night.

17:57.943 --> 18:01.970
-Oxygen. I need some oxygen.
-I thought you'd like that.

18:02.147 --> 18:03.478
Oh, this is huge!

18:03.649 --> 18:07.244
-I know.
-All right, okay. Let's go. Details.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.944
-No, I can't give details.
-No details?

18:11.223 --> 18:12.986
I'm not in the mood.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.986
You ask me here to have lunch...

18:17.162 --> 18:19.153
...tell me you slept with Elaine...

18:19.331 --> 18:22.494
...and then say you're not
in the mood for details.

18:22.668 --> 18:25.193
Now, you listen to me.

18:25.370 --> 18:28.237
I want details,
and I want them right now.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.840
I don't have a job,
I have no place to go.

18:31.009 --> 18:34.445
You're not in the mood?
Well, you get in the mood!

18:37.116 --> 18:39.311
I was at the unemployment office.

18:39.485 --> 18:42.716
I told them I was very close to getting
a job with Vandelay Industries...

18:42.888 --> 18:45.857
...and I gave them your phone number.
So when the phone rings...

18:46.024 --> 18:48.515
...you have to answer,
"Vandelay Industries."

18:48.694 --> 18:50.924
-I'm Vandelay Industries?
-Right.

18:51.096 --> 18:53.326
-What is that?
-You're in latex.

18:53.499 --> 18:55.126
-Latex.
-Right.

18:55.367 --> 18:58.131
-What do I do with latex?
-I don't know! You manufacture it!

18:58.303 --> 19:02.399
-Right here in this little apartment?
-And what do I say about you?

19:02.574 --> 19:04.974
You're considering hiring me
for your latex salesman.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.038
-I'll hire you as my latex salesman?
-Right.

19:08.213 --> 19:10.875
I don't think so.

19:11.416 --> 19:15.216
Man, I'm telling you this pizza idea
is really gonna happen.

19:15.554 --> 19:18.523
This is the thing where you go and
you have to make your own pizza?

19:18.724 --> 19:19.748
We give you the dough.

19:19.925 --> 19:23.326
You smash it. You pound it.
You fling it up in the air.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.293
And then you get to put your sauce
and sprinkle your cheese.

19:26.465 --> 19:29.730
And then,
you slide it into the oven.

19:30.602 --> 19:32.126
You have to know how to do that.

19:32.304 --> 19:36.104
You can't have people shoving
their arms into a 600-degree oven!

19:36.275 --> 19:39.039
-It's all supervised.
-Oh, well....

19:39.211 --> 19:41.873
Tolstoy used to write
in the village square.

19:42.047 --> 19:43.708
The faces inspired him.

19:43.882 --> 19:47.283
Although, one wonders
if <i>War and Peace</i> would have been...

19:47.452 --> 19:51.252
...as highly acclaimed, had it been
published under it's original title...

19:51.423 --> 19:53.914
...<i>War--What Is It Good For?</i>

19:54.593 --> 19:55.958
-What?
-Yeah.

19:56.128 --> 19:58.619
Mr. Lippman, it was his mistress
who insisted...

19:58.797 --> 20:01.459
-...that he call it <i>War and Peace</i>.
-Elaine, Elaine.

20:01.633 --> 20:02.998
<i>War--What Is It Good For?</i>

20:03.168 --> 20:05.432
<i>Absolutely nothing</i>

20:05.604 --> 20:07.469
If I see her, what do I say
I'm doing here?

20:07.639 --> 20:09.470
To see me. I work in the building.

20:09.641 --> 20:11.404
What do you do?

20:11.677 --> 20:13.110
I'm an architect.

20:14.379 --> 20:15.778
You're an architect?

20:15.948 --> 20:17.609
I'm not?

20:20.719 --> 20:23.017
I don't see architecture
coming from you.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.988
We'll make our choice in a few days
and we'll let you know.

20:27.492 --> 20:30.256
-I have no chance, do l?
-No.

20:31.463 --> 20:34.227
You know I always wanted
to pretend I was an architect.

20:34.533 --> 20:37.127
-What do you do?
-I'm an architect.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.428
Have you designed
any buildings in New York?

20:40.973 --> 20:43.464
Have you seen the new addition
to the Guggenheim?

20:44.009 --> 20:46.170
-You did that?
-Yep, yep.

20:46.345 --> 20:48.438
Really didn't take very long either.

20:48.747 --> 20:51.773
The beauty of my book is,
if you don't have a coffee table...

20:51.950 --> 20:54.851
...it turns into a coffee table.

20:55.654 --> 20:58.589
-Is that fabulous?
-Look at this.

21:00.325 --> 21:01.758
What-delay Industries?

21:01.927 --> 21:03.326
-No.
-Vandelay!

21:03.495 --> 21:04.757
Say Vandelay!

21:05.030 --> 21:07.157
No, you're way, way, way off!

21:07.366 --> 21:10.199
-No, say--
-Vandelay! Say--

21:10.369 --> 21:11.836
Vandelay Industries!

21:12.838 --> 21:15.068
No problem, no problem.

21:24.650 --> 21:27.778
And you want to be
my latex salesman.

21:31.023 --> 21:34.459
I think Superman probably has
a very good sense of humor.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.325
I never heard him say anything funny.

21:37.496 --> 21:39.657
He's got super strength, super speed.

21:39.831 --> 21:41.628
I'm sure he's got super humor.

21:42.501 --> 21:45.698
Either you're born with humor,
or you're not. It's not gonna change.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.862
Even if you go
from the red sun of Krypton...

21:48.040 --> 21:50.201
...all the way to the yellow sun
of the Earth.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.112
Why? Why would that one area
of his mind...

21:54.279 --> 21:57.715
...not be affected
by the yellow sun of the Earth?

21:57.916 --> 21:59.975
I don't know. But he ain't funny.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.677
-What's today?
-It's Thursday.

22:02.854 --> 22:04.344
Really?

22:04.523 --> 22:06.650
It feels like Tuesday.

22:07.359 --> 22:09.259
Tuesday has no feel.

22:09.428 --> 22:11.362
Monday has a feel.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.426
Friday has a feel.

22:13.598 --> 22:14.826
Sunday has a feel.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.060
-I feel Tuesday and Wednesday.
-Shut up, the both of you.

22:18.236 --> 22:19.567
You double dipped the chip.

22:19.738 --> 22:22.002
Double dipped?
What are you talking about?

22:22.174 --> 22:25.439
You dipped the chip.
You took a bite...

22:25.610 --> 22:27.737
...and you dipped again.

22:29.214 --> 22:31.444
-So?
-It's like putting your whole mouth...

22:31.616 --> 22:33.641
...right in the dip.

22:34.152 --> 22:40.557
From now on, when you take a chip
just take one dip and end it.

22:40.792 --> 22:42.384
Could I offer you
something to drink?

22:42.561 --> 22:47.260
Okay, yeah. I'll have a....
Do you have a decaf cappuccino?

22:49.267 --> 22:51.599
I don't think we have that.

22:51.937 --> 22:53.905
Well, that's a little strange.

22:54.439 --> 22:59.376
-Why does that surprise you?
-Well, it's a very popular drink.

23:00.278 --> 23:03.543
-This is an office.
-That's true.

23:03.915 --> 23:06.076
Magellan? You like Magellan?

23:06.251 --> 23:09.743
Oh, yeah. My favorite explorer.
Around the world. Come on.

23:10.021 --> 23:13.115
-Who do you like?
-I like de Soto.

23:13.458 --> 23:15.892
-De Soto? What did he do?
-Discovered the Mississippi.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.325
Oh, like they wouldn't have found
that anyway.

23:18.530 --> 23:21.090
I was talking to this guy,
and I just happened to throw...

23:21.266 --> 23:22.494
...my purse on the sofa.

23:22.667 --> 23:26.501
And my diaphragm goes flying out.

23:28.907 --> 23:32.070
So I just froze, you know:

23:32.277 --> 23:35.041
Staring at my diaphragm, you know?
It's just lying there.

23:35.213 --> 23:37.238
So this woman who sold me
this hair thing...

23:37.416 --> 23:39.941
...she grabbed it before
the guy noticed, so, I mean...

23:40.118 --> 23:42.313
...big deal, right?

23:42.487 --> 23:45.251
So I carry around my diaphragm.
Who doesn't?

23:45.424 --> 23:47.517
I mean, like, it's a big, big secret...

23:47.692 --> 23:50.991
...that women carry around
their diaphragms.

23:51.163 --> 23:52.994
You never know when
you're gonna need it.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.269
I hate Keith Hernandez.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.273
-Hate him!
-I despise him.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.411
-Why?
-Why? I'll tell you why.

24:06.578 --> 24:07.909
-Let me tell her.
-You can't--

24:08.079 --> 24:09.808
-You always tell it.
-All right, tell it.

24:09.981 --> 24:12.279
-You just tell it.
-All right.

24:13.618 --> 24:17.110
June 14th, 1987, Mets-Phillies.

24:17.355 --> 24:20.552
We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon
in the right-field stands...

24:20.725 --> 24:23.159
...when a crucial Hernandez error
opens the door...

24:23.328 --> 24:26.195
...to a five-run Phillies ninth.
Cost the Mets the game!

24:26.364 --> 24:29.333
Our day was ruined.

24:29.568 --> 24:32.628
There was a lot of people waiting
by the players' parking lot.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.294
Now we're coming down the ramp.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.270
<i>Newman was in front of me.</i>

24:36.441 --> 24:38.534
<i>Hernandez was coming toward us.</i>

24:38.710 --> 24:44.171
As he passes us, Newman turns
and says, "Nice game, pretty boy."

24:46.451 --> 24:48.817
<i>Hernandez continued past us
up the ramp.</i>

24:48.987 --> 24:51.979
Then, a second later,
something happened...

24:52.157 --> 24:56.116
...that changed us in a very deep
and profound way...

24:56.294 --> 24:58.057
...from that day forward.

24:58.396 --> 24:59.863
-What was it?
-He spit on us!

25:02.834 --> 25:05.234
<i>And I screamed out, "I'm hit!"</i>

25:06.771 --> 25:11.367
Then I turned, and the spit ricocheted
off him, and it hit me.

25:14.279 --> 25:15.837
What a story.

25:16.014 --> 25:18.812
Unfortunately, the immutable laws
of physics contradict...

25:18.984 --> 25:21.452
...the whole premise of your account.

25:21.620 --> 25:24.282
Allow me to reconstruct this,
if I may, for Ms. Benes...

25:24.456 --> 25:27.050
...as I've heard this story
a number of times.

25:27.225 --> 25:30.388
Newman, Kramer,
if you'll indulge me.

25:30.862 --> 25:32.727
According to your story...

25:32.898 --> 25:35.890
...Hernandez passes you
and starts walking up the ramp.

25:36.301 --> 25:38.394
Then you say you were struck...

25:38.970 --> 25:40.904
...on the right temple.

25:41.673 --> 25:44.506
The spit then proceeds to ricochet...

25:44.676 --> 25:48.737
...off the temple, striking Newman
between the third and the forth rib.

25:51.449 --> 25:53.212
The spit then came off the rib...

25:53.385 --> 25:56.718
...made a right turn,
hitting Newman in the right wrist...

25:58.356 --> 26:00.722
...causing him to drop
his baseball cap.

26:02.761 --> 26:05.958
The spit then splashed off the wrist,
pauses...

26:06.131 --> 26:08.122
...in midair, mind you...

26:09.534 --> 26:14.301
...makes a left turn and lands
on Newman's left thigh.

26:16.207 --> 26:19.802
That is one magic loogie.

26:28.086 --> 26:31.988
Story is the foundation
of all entertainment.

26:32.157 --> 26:34.523
And people really have
to care about the characters.

26:34.693 --> 26:36.558
Care? Forget about care. Love.

26:36.728 --> 26:38.286
They have to love them.

26:38.463 --> 26:40.431
Now, get the hell out of my house.

26:40.599 --> 26:44.035
Quiet! You shut up!

26:44.202 --> 26:46.670
At this moment, you're banned
from the store. Banned!

26:46.838 --> 26:49.705
It's a pizza the moment
you put your fists in the dough.

26:51.409 --> 26:53.741
I have a hair on my tongue.

26:53.912 --> 26:55.345
Can't get it off.

26:55.513 --> 26:57.105
You know how much I hate that?

26:57.282 --> 26:59.648
Soup's not a meal.
You're supposed to buy me a meal.

26:59.818 --> 27:02.048
Yeah. Just keep out
of my business, you big ape.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.120
Who you calling "big ape"?

27:04.289 --> 27:06.519
I'm calling you an ape.

27:06.691 --> 27:09.455
All right, break it up.
Come on, you two.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.220
Just cut it out now.

27:11.396 --> 27:14.661
But you put on a pair of shoes
in the New York Public Library, fella.

27:15.033 --> 27:17.661
We had a funny guy with us in Korea.

27:17.836 --> 27:19.770
A tail gunner.

27:19.938 --> 27:22.873
They blew his brains out
all over the Pacific.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.472
There's nothing funny about that.

27:28.647 --> 27:32.913
We will annex Poland by the spring
at any cost!

27:33.084 --> 27:36.850
And our stock will rise high.

27:39.424 --> 27:41.824
You think you're an idiot,
but with all due respect...

27:41.993 --> 27:43.824
...I'm a much bigger idiot
than you are.

27:43.995 --> 27:46.793
Don't insult me, my friend.
Remember who you're talking to.

27:46.965 --> 27:48.523
No one's a bigger idiot than me.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.395
Am I a hipster doofus?

27:50.568 --> 27:52.195
-No.
-No.

27:52.370 --> 27:53.894
Said I'm not good-looking enough.

27:54.072 --> 27:57.667
Not good-looking.
Jerry, look at me. Look at my face.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.902
Am I beautiful?
George, am I beautiful?

28:04.783 --> 28:06.614
-You're very attractive.
-Yeah.

28:06.785 --> 28:09.515
Is it possible I'm not as attractive
as I think I am?

28:09.688 --> 28:10.950
We're not gay.

28:11.122 --> 28:12.521
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.091
-No, of course not.
-It's fine, if that's who you are.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.251
-Absolutely.
-I mean, I have many gay friends.

28:17.429 --> 28:19.693
-My father's gay.
-Look...

28:19.864 --> 28:21.161
...I know what I heard.

28:21.332 --> 28:23.960
-Heard. It was a joke.
-Look, you wanna have sex right now?

28:24.135 --> 28:26.899
Do you wanna have sex
with me right now? Let's go.

28:28.807 --> 28:32.208
Come on! Let's go, baby! Come on!

28:33.411 --> 28:37.108
Hey, come on. Let's go.
I thought we were gonna take a steam.

28:38.216 --> 28:41.117
-No, I don't want any steam.
-No. No steam.

28:41.286 --> 28:43.481
Well, I don't wanna
sit there naked all by myself.

28:43.655 --> 28:45.782
-You've faked?
-On occasion.

28:45.957 --> 28:48.084
-And the guy never knows?
-No.

28:48.259 --> 28:50.284
How can he not know that?

28:50.462 --> 28:52.862
Because I was good.

28:53.631 --> 28:57.328
I guess after that many beers,
he's probably a little groggy anyway.

28:59.537 --> 29:02.870
Well, you didn't know.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.973
What's that?

29:07.145 --> 29:09.409
You didn't know.

29:09.581 --> 29:13.483
-Are you saying--?
-I think I'll have a piece of cake.

29:13.651 --> 29:15.118
-With me?
-Well....

29:15.286 --> 29:17.117
-You faked with me?
-Yeah.

29:17.288 --> 29:18.812
-You faked with me?
-Yes.

29:18.990 --> 29:21.390
-No. You faked it?
-Yes. I faked it.

29:21.559 --> 29:24.255
That whole thing, the whole
production, it was all an act?

29:24.763 --> 29:26.924
Not bad, huh?

29:27.098 --> 29:30.158
What about the breathing, the panting,
the moaning, the screaming?

29:30.335 --> 29:33.327
Fake, fake, fake, fake.

29:33.505 --> 29:35.803
I'm disturbed. I'm depressed.

29:35.974 --> 29:39.603
I'm inadequate. I got it all!

29:39.778 --> 29:41.905
Can't you see what's happened?

29:42.514 --> 29:44.641
I've become George.

29:44.816 --> 29:46.306
Don't say that.

29:46.484 --> 29:49.817
It's true. I'm George.

29:49.988 --> 29:51.512
I'm George.

29:51.689 --> 29:53.122
Tuna on toast, coleslaw...

29:53.291 --> 29:55.259
-...cup of coffee.
-Yeah.

29:55.426 --> 29:58.520
No, no, wait a minute.
I always have tuna on toast.

29:58.696 --> 30:01.631
Nothing's every worked out for me
with tuna on toast.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.530
I want the complete opposite
of tuna on toast.

30:05.236 --> 30:07.670
Chicken salad on rye...

30:07.839 --> 30:11.832
...untoasted, with a side
of potato salad...

30:12.010 --> 30:13.705
...and a cup of tea.

30:13.878 --> 30:17.541
Well, there's no telling
what can happen from this.

30:17.715 --> 30:19.342
Chicken salad's
not the opposite of tuna.

30:19.517 --> 30:21.849
Salmon's the opposite of tuna
because salmon swim...

30:22.020 --> 30:25.581
...against the current,
and the tuna swim with it.

30:27.025 --> 30:28.993
Good for the tuna.

30:31.262 --> 30:34.754
George, you know that woman
just looked at you.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.398
So what?
What am I supposed to do?

30:37.569 --> 30:39.196
Go talk to her.

30:39.370 --> 30:43.170
Elaine, bald men with no jobs
and no money...

30:43.341 --> 30:45.809
...who live with their parents...

30:46.177 --> 30:48.577
...don't approach strange women.

30:49.547 --> 30:51.481
Try the opposite.
Instead of tuna salad...

30:51.649 --> 30:54.140
...and being intimidated by women,
chicken salad...

30:54.319 --> 30:58.255
-...and going right up to them.
-Yeah, I should do the opposite.

30:58.423 --> 31:00.152
If every instinct you have is wrong...

31:00.325 --> 31:03.294
...then the opposite
would have to be right.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.520
Yes.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.564
I will do the opposite.

31:09.767 --> 31:13.066
I used to sit here and do nothing
and regret it for the rest of the day.

31:13.238 --> 31:17.174
So now I will do the opposite,
and I will do something.

31:23.581 --> 31:26.573
Excuse me.
I couldn't help but notice that...

31:26.751 --> 31:29.618
-...you were looking in my direction.
-Oh, yes, I was.

31:29.787 --> 31:32.381
You just ordered
the same exact lunch as me.

31:34.025 --> 31:35.686
My name is George.

31:35.860 --> 31:39.091
I'm unemployed,
and I live with my parents.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.901
I'm Victoria. Hi.

31:49.507 --> 31:51.805
Catch phrases

31:52.510 --> 31:54.603
Boy, these pretzels
are making me thirsty.

31:54.779 --> 31:57.179
These pretzels are making me thirsty.

31:57.348 --> 31:59.509
These pretzels...

32:00.318 --> 32:02.115
...are making me thirsty!

32:02.287 --> 32:04.949
Boy, I'm really starting to
dislike the Drake.

32:05.123 --> 32:06.112
Hate the Drake!

32:08.026 --> 32:09.789
You are so good-looking.

32:09.961 --> 32:12.088
You can't believe her.
She's one of these low-talkers.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.594
Because he's a high talker.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.255
He's nice. Bit of a close talker.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.162
How about you, Jerry?

32:17.702 --> 32:18.964
I'm swamped.

32:19.137 --> 32:22.595
You sure? You can examine
the artwork up close.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.708
I don't have a square to spare.

32:24.876 --> 32:26.639
I can't spare a square.

32:26.811 --> 32:28.608
I need hand! I have no hand!

32:28.780 --> 32:30.145
-Newman.
-Newman.

32:30.315 --> 32:34.012
-Newman.
-Hello, Newman.

32:34.185 --> 32:35.743
So you're still master
of your domain.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.548
Yes. Master of my domain.

32:38.723 --> 32:40.714
I am king of the county.

32:40.892 --> 32:42.291
Lord of the manor.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.826
I'm queen of the castle.

32:45.630 --> 32:48.656
-You mean shrinkage.
-Yes.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.459
Significant shrinkage.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.467
So you feel you were shortchanged?

32:53.638 --> 32:55.162
Yes.

32:55.340 --> 32:58.070
If she thinks that's me, she's under
a complete misapprehension.

32:58.242 --> 33:00.073
Well, so, what's the difference?

33:00.244 --> 33:03.702
-What if she discusses it with Jane?
-Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.

33:03.881 --> 33:05.849
Could you tell her about
the shrinkage factor?

33:06.017 --> 33:07.814
I'm not gonna tell her
about your shrinkage.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.887
Besides, I think women know
about shrinkage.

33:11.055 --> 33:12.682
How do women know
about shrinkage?

33:12.857 --> 33:14.848
Isn't it common knowledge?

33:15.026 --> 33:16.288
-Elaine.
-Elaine.

33:16.461 --> 33:18.929
Elaine!

33:19.998 --> 33:23.195
-What?
-Do women know about shrinkage?

33:23.368 --> 33:24.892
What do you mean, like laundry?

33:25.903 --> 33:26.892
No.

33:27.071 --> 33:31.201
Like when a man goes swimming,
afterwards....

33:33.111 --> 33:35.204
It shrinks?

33:37.081 --> 33:39.549
Like a frightened turtle.

33:44.989 --> 33:48.516
-Why does it shrink?
-It just does.

33:50.028 --> 33:53.054
I don't know how you guys
walk around with those things.

33:57.969 --> 33:59.436
--about the script.

33:59.604 --> 34:03.131
The script. Now, I've read
this thing three times.

34:03.307 --> 34:04.467
Yeah.

34:05.676 --> 34:07.735
And every time I read it....

34:11.382 --> 34:12.610
What?

34:14.284 --> 34:16.549
-Excuse me for a second.
-What?

34:16.721 --> 34:20.179
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol?
I keep them in my wallet.

34:21.092 --> 34:23.492
You think he liked it?

34:27.965 --> 34:30.058
I'm not sure.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.673
The air conditioner!

35:35.666 --> 35:37.156
My mother caught me.

35:37.902 --> 35:39.460
Caught you? Doing what?

35:39.637 --> 35:41.832
You know.

35:44.408 --> 35:46.842
I was alone....

35:47.845 --> 35:49.642
You mean--?

35:49.814 --> 35:52.840
-She caught you?
-Where?

35:53.017 --> 35:55.349
I stopped by the house
to drop the car off...

35:55.520 --> 35:57.613
...and I went inside
for a few minutes.

35:57.788 --> 35:59.915
Nobody was there.
They're supposed to be working.

36:00.892 --> 36:04.851
My mother had a <i>Glamour</i> magazine.
I started leafing through it.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.157
<i>Glamour</i> ?

36:07.331 --> 36:11.392
-So one thing led to another.
-What did she do?

36:11.569 --> 36:15.437
First she screams, "George,
what are you doing? My God!"

36:16.507 --> 36:17.974
Looked like she was gonna faint.

36:18.142 --> 36:20.940
She started clutching the wall,
trying to hang onto it.

36:21.112 --> 36:24.172
I didn't know whether to keep her
from falling or zip up.

36:24.949 --> 36:27.247
-What did you do?
-I zipped up.

36:27.818 --> 36:29.285
-So she fell?
-Yeah.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.182
Well, I couldn't run over there
the way I was.

36:32.356 --> 36:35.120
-No, I guess you couldn't.
-I wouldn't think so.

36:35.293 --> 36:39.195
So she fell, and then she starts
screaming, "My back, my back!"

36:39.363 --> 36:41.456
I picked her up.
I took her to the hospital.

36:42.567 --> 36:44.535
-How is she?
-She's in traction.

36:44.702 --> 36:46.499
-I'm sorry.
-It's not funny, Elaine.

36:46.671 --> 36:49.765
I know. I'm sorry. It's serious.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.501
Her back went out. She's gotta
be there for a couple days.

36:52.677 --> 36:55.168
<i>Glamour</i> ?

36:56.013 --> 36:57.275
I'll tell you this, though:

36:57.448 --> 36:59.416
I am never doing...

36:59.584 --> 37:01.381
...that again.

37:01.552 --> 37:04.077
What? You mean in your mother's
house or altogether?

37:04.255 --> 37:06.621
-Altogether.
-Give me a break.

37:06.791 --> 37:08.918
Yeah, right.

37:09.093 --> 37:11.561
-You don't think I can?
-No chance.

37:12.196 --> 37:16.257
-You think you could?
-I could hold out longer than you.

37:16.801 --> 37:18.735
Care to make it interesting?

37:19.971 --> 37:21.268
Sure. How much?

37:21.672 --> 37:22.661
Hundred dollars?

37:23.040 --> 37:24.029
You're on.

37:24.208 --> 37:27.644
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Count me in on this.

37:27.812 --> 37:31.111
You? You'll be out before we
get the check.

37:33.017 --> 37:34.541
I want in on this.

37:34.719 --> 37:37.950
-No, no.
-It's apples and oranges.

37:38.122 --> 37:39.384
-It's different.
-Why? Why?

37:39.557 --> 37:41.616
-Because you're a woman.
-So what?

37:41.792 --> 37:45.353
It's easier for a woman not to do it
than a man. We have to do it.

37:45.529 --> 37:48.430
It's part of our lifestyle.

37:49.433 --> 37:50.991
It's like shaving.

37:51.168 --> 37:54.296
That is such baloney.
I shave my legs.

37:54.472 --> 37:57.236
Not every day.

37:58.175 --> 37:59.437
-You wanna be in?
-Yeah.

37:59.610 --> 38:02.807
You gotta give us odds.
At least 2-1. You gotta put up $200.

38:02.980 --> 38:05.210
No. A thousand.

38:05.383 --> 38:07.874
No. I'll put up 150.

38:08.052 --> 38:10.953
-All right. You're in for 150.
-Okay, 150.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.589
How we gonna monitor this?

38:12.757 --> 38:15.385
Obviously, we all know each
other very well.

38:15.559 --> 38:20.895
I'm sure we'll all feel comfortable within
the confines of the honor system.

38:22.366 --> 38:24.391
All right. Come on.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.130
Fire!

38:37.114 --> 38:40.675
We have sacrificed everything,
all for the sake of our little...

38:41.185 --> 38:43.676
...bubble boy.

38:43.854 --> 38:46.846
-Excuse me.
-Oh, here.

38:51.395 --> 38:53.590
Amazing how many
beautiful women live in New York.

38:53.764 --> 38:57.825
You're as pretty as any of them.
Just need a nose job.

39:02.273 --> 39:05.731
<i>Yankee bean. Yankee bean.</i>

39:06.143 --> 39:12.378
<i>I like my Yankee bean.</i>

39:13.084 --> 39:16.781
In fact, I hate anyone that ever had
a pony when they were growing up.

39:16.954 --> 39:18.581
I had a pony.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.822
Well, I didn't....

39:22.993 --> 39:25.791
When I was a little girl in Poland...

39:25.963 --> 39:28.295
...we all had ponies.

39:28.466 --> 39:30.229
My sister had pony.

39:30.401 --> 39:32.266
My cousin had pony.

39:32.436 --> 39:35.030
-So, what's wrong with that?
-Nothing, nothing at all.

39:35.206 --> 39:38.733
He was a beautiful pony,
and I loved him.

39:38.909 --> 39:41.810
Well, I'm sure you did.
Who wouldn't love a pony?

39:41.979 --> 39:44.641
Who wouldn't love a person
that had a pony?

39:44.815 --> 39:47.079
You. You said so.

39:47.251 --> 39:48.809
It's my father's cabin!

39:50.254 --> 39:54.452
I just realized, you never gave
me back the change from the tolls.

39:54.625 --> 39:56.786
So you heard that
I was in a car accident...

39:56.961 --> 40:00.522
...and then decided to stop off
for some Jujyfruit?

40:01.899 --> 40:03.696
Well...

40:04.268 --> 40:06.759
...the counter was right there.

40:06.937 --> 40:09.497
I didn't know she had a pony.

40:10.374 --> 40:12.740
Who figures an immigrant
is gonna have a pony?

40:14.912 --> 40:17.904
I mean, in all the pictures I saw
of immigrants on boats...

40:18.082 --> 40:19.879
...coming into New York Harbor...

40:20.050 --> 40:22.280
...I never saw one of them
sitting on a pony.

40:24.588 --> 40:27.614
But why would anyone come here
if they had a pony?

40:27.792 --> 40:31.421
Who leaves a country packed with
ponies to go to a non-pony country?

40:32.463 --> 40:35.091
It doesn't make sense.

40:35.433 --> 40:38.300
Now we'll open
the peritoneal cavity...

40:38.469 --> 40:41.905
...exposing the body's
internal organs.

40:42.740 --> 40:45.903
-What are you eating?
-Junior Mints.

40:46.544 --> 40:48.409
-You want one?
-No.

40:48.579 --> 40:51.275
Now, I can't see.

40:55.386 --> 40:57.286
Could you get--?

41:02.693 --> 41:04.183
Where'd you get those?

41:04.361 --> 41:05.828
-The machine. You want one?
-No.

41:05.996 --> 41:07.759
-Here. Take one.
-I don't want one.

41:07.932 --> 41:09.365
-They're good.
-I don't want any.

41:09.533 --> 41:12.866
-Just take one.
-No. Stop-- Kramer, stop it.

41:17.441 --> 41:19.875
It's a Junior Mint.

41:20.044 --> 41:21.204
Drake's Coffee Cake?

41:21.378 --> 41:22.811
-Snapple?
-No, thanks.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.709
-Snapple?
-No, thanks.

41:24.882 --> 41:25.906
-PEZ?
-No.

41:26.083 --> 41:27.311
A box of Jujyfruits?

41:27.485 --> 41:29.385
-Clark Bar.
-I love Yoo-hoo.

41:29.553 --> 41:31.714
-Oh, Chunkys.
-Chocolate babka.

41:31.889 --> 41:32.719
It's Gore-Tex.

41:32.890 --> 41:35.051
-Cashmere?
-No, Gore-Tex.

41:35.226 --> 41:37.490
Who's gonna turn down
a Junior Mint?

41:37.828 --> 41:40.626
It's chocolate, it's peppermint.
It's delicious.

41:40.798 --> 41:43.323
-That's true.
-It's very refreshing.

41:44.134 --> 41:45.396
What's going on over here?

41:45.569 --> 41:47.161
There's a beached whale.
She's dying.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.932
Is anyone here a marine biologist?

41:55.579 --> 41:57.638
The sea was angry that day,
my friends.

42:00.951 --> 42:03.920
Like an old man trying
to send back soup in a deli.

42:10.461 --> 42:13.055
I got about 50 feet out,
when suddenly...

42:13.230 --> 42:16.222
...the great beast
appeared before me.

42:16.400 --> 42:19.528
I tell you, he was 10 stories high
if he was a foot.

42:20.304 --> 42:23.398
As if sensing my presence,
he let out a great bellow.

42:23.574 --> 42:25.633
I said, "Easy, big fella."

42:27.444 --> 42:30.811
And then, as I watched
him struggling, I realized...

42:30.981 --> 42:33.211
...that something was obstructing
its breathing.

42:33.384 --> 42:36.581
From where I was standing, I could
see into the eye of the great fish.

42:36.754 --> 42:39.086
-Mammal.
-Whatever.

42:39.990 --> 42:41.855
-What did you do next?
-Well, then...

42:42.026 --> 42:44.961
...from out of nowhere,
a huge tidal wave lifted me...

42:45.129 --> 42:48.121
...tossed me like a cork,
and I found myself on top of him...

42:48.299 --> 42:49.891
...face to face with the blowhole.

42:50.601 --> 42:53.434
I could barely see from the waves
crashing down upon me...

42:53.604 --> 42:56.630
...but I knew something was there.

42:56.807 --> 42:58.399
So I reached my hand in...

42:58.576 --> 43:01.943
...felt around, and pulled out
the obstruction.

43:22.466 --> 43:25.299
What is that, a Titleist?

43:28.005 --> 43:29.973
A hole in one, huh?

43:31.542 --> 43:34.602
We go into NBC, tell them we got
an idea for a show about nothing.

43:34.778 --> 43:36.405
-Exactly.
-"What's your show about?"

43:36.580 --> 43:38.639
-I say, "Nothing."
-There you go.

43:39.283 --> 43:41.114
I think you may have something here.

44:13.951 --> 44:17.648
Why don't you two go to the movies
by yourselves. I'm not in the mood.

44:17.821 --> 44:19.982
Well, me either.
I'm going to Sky Burger.

44:20.758 --> 44:23.249
-So you're not going?
-You don't need us.

44:23.427 --> 44:25.861
Well, I can't go to a bad movie
by myself.

44:26.030 --> 44:29.796
What, am I gonna make
sarcastic remarks to strangers?

44:29.967 --> 44:32.367
I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.

44:32.536 --> 44:36.233
-Should we tell him we're leaving?
-What for? Let's just get out of here.

44:42.513 --> 44:45.004
Seinfeld, four!
