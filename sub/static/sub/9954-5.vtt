between two worlds,

12:23.118 --> 12:26.360
I can't move my legs.
I probably never will.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.905
Butlguess
I'm lucky to be alive, right?

12:29.041 --> 12:32.750
Tyler, Katie said you crashed
when you lost control of your car.

12:32.878 --> 12:35.335
Did anything strange happen
just before the accident?

12:35.464 --> 12:38.501
You're gonna think I'm crazy,
but right before we crashed,

12:38.634 --> 12:41.000
Katie looked at me funny,
and something happened.

12:41.136 --> 12:42.967
I couldn't control myself.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.714
My body did its own thing.
That's why I crashed. I'm sorry.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.592
You didn't say anything about Katie
to the cops at the scene?

12:49.728 --> 12:51.810
Why would I?

12:51.939 --> 12:53.600
It doesn't make any sense.

12:53.732 --> 12:56.348
It does if your girlfriend is
troubled.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.100
I've heard of those.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.737
But Katie? No.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.194
I can't believe it.

13:01.323 --> 13:04.565
Tyler, if you think of anything else,
give me a call.

13:09.665 --> 13:10.871
Hey, kid.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.825
I'm gonna write you a prescription.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.708
When you get out,

13:19.841 --> 13:21.422
that'll get you a free round
at the Gull.

13:22.219 --> 13:23.755
Thanks.

13:29.601 --> 13:33.310
—What did the doctor say?
—Right as rain.

13:33.438 --> 13:34.814
Healthy.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.396
But I don't really trust doctors.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.390
Well, you know,
you should have seen

13:38.527 --> 13:40.233
Detective Wuornos
questioning Tyler in there.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.068
It was... It was good.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.733
Really?

13:43.865 --> 13:46.277
Sounds like he was affected
by the same thing Josh was,

13:46.410 --> 13:48.526
and in both cases,
Katie was right there,

13:48.662 --> 13:51.324
so she could have some sort
of "black widow" trouble...

13:51.873 --> 13:55.161
Uh, brainwashing guys
to try and kill themselves.

13:55.293 --> 13:59.206
And troubled people in this town,
they can do that stuff?

14:01.049 --> 14:04.712
Why the hell does anybody
still live here?

14:10.934 --> 14:12.435
Thanks for bringing me home.

14:12.561 --> 14:15.394
After what you've been through,
|—— | get it.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.733
Katie, are you okay?

14:22.571 --> 14:24.152
It worked again.

14:24.990 --> 14:25.979
What?

14:32.414 --> 14:34.621
I had this coming.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.415
No!

14:40.756 --> 14:42.712
Apparently Katie stepped out
in front of the car

14:42.841 --> 14:44.297
like she was brainwashed, too.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.291
So it's somebody else's
grim reaper trouble

14:46.428 --> 14:48.919
making the rounds, then.

14:49.056 --> 14:49.966
What do you think the chances are

14:50.098 --> 14:52.635
that we made his hit list,
huh,cheekbones?

14:53.769 --> 14:54.724
—Hey.
—Hey.

14:54.853 --> 14:57.344
Do you have any idea
how hard this is for me?

14:57.939 --> 15:00.316
Look, even though
I knew it meant I was gonna die,

15:00.442 --> 15:02.307
I still wanted to find Audrey.

15:02.444 --> 15:04.184
I did, too.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.482
Now, I am trying to fix all of this,

15:06.615 --> 15:09.072
and you should start trying, too.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.235
Come be awesome.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.661
Poor girl.

15:15.791 --> 15:19.500
Did she do that to herself
with her trouble thing?

15:19.628 --> 15:21.914
We think she's another victim
like Josh.

15:23.799 --> 15:24.914
Where'd you get that?

15:26.051 --> 15:28.337
Oh, the cop gave it to me.

15:28.470 --> 15:30.836
Hey, does everybody here think
that I'm Audrey?

15:30.972 --> 15:34.840
Well, we told everyone
that you had amnesia,

15:34.976 --> 15:36.182
that you thought you were
somebody else

15:36.311 --> 15:39.348
and that, you know,
working would hopefully

15:39.481 --> 15:41.938
help you remember who you were.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.399
—Here.
—No.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.768
Before I jumped out of the barn,

15:45.904 --> 15:48.065
William told me
that l belonged in Haven,

15:48.198 --> 15:49.358
that I had a purpose.

15:49.491 --> 15:51.607
So maybe stopping those people
from shooting you

15:51.743 --> 15:55.361
and helping you figure out
what happened to Josh and Katie...

15:55.497 --> 15:57.704
Maybe that's...

15:57.833 --> 16:00.165
Maybe that's what William
was talking about.

16:01.002 --> 16:03.209
—What are you doing here?
—Hey.

16:03.338 --> 16:06.671
I brought you some of your clothes.
I mean, Audrey's clothes, sorry.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.836
Ah, 5O shades of beige?

16:09.469 --> 16:11.209
At least they should fit, right?

16:11.346 --> 16:13.803
Okay, well, I will make sure
to avoid mirrors.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.172
Wow.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.845
Let's go.

16:19.187 --> 16:20.973
You're really doing this?

16:21.106 --> 16:22.721
No, of course not.

16:22.858 --> 16:24.223
Back there in the woods,

16:24.359 --> 16:27.351
l was just trying to buy time,
keep him alive.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.229
I never thought that The Guard
would buy it, but they did,

16:30.365 --> 16:32.401
and now | just have to keep
this ball in the air.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.399
Okay. Let's go.

16:34.536 --> 16:35.946
No.

16:37.289 --> 16:38.995
Look”.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.991
This trouble is bad.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.833
I want you to stay away from it.

16:45.714 --> 16:47.124
The three of us got it covered.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.667
The three of you, of course.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.381
I wasn't trying to tag along
or anything.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.501
It was force of habit, I guess.

16:52.637 --> 16:55.424
And I've got to go get my stuff
out of her apartment, so...

16:55.557 --> 16:56.967
Good luck.

17:10.572 --> 17:13.405
Excuse me.
Uh, we're closed.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.069
Right. Well...

17:19.206 --> 17:21.322
We're open now.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.789
For a broken heart,
may I recommend Tequila?

17:26.922 --> 17:28.458
Rebound in a bottle.

17:28.590 --> 17:32.048
Money problems... Scotch.

17:32.177 --> 17:36.045
Or if you're just after
some afternoon fun...

17:36.181 --> 17:37.762
Beet

17:39.935 --> 17:43.302
—On the house.
—Thanks.

17:43.438 --> 17:45.303
You want to tell your bartender
your troubles?

17:45.440 --> 17:47.021
It's an American tradition.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.766
You got all day?

17:49.903 --> 17:51.564
Yep.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.236
I'm surprised you came here, Jordan.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.198
I think you found the wrong Crocker.

17:59.204 --> 18:01.411
—You're Duke's brother?
—Yeah.

18:01.539 --> 18:02.995
Perfect.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.251
Give us a minute?

18:09.923 --> 18:12.164
Come on, I got something
to show you.

18:17.472 --> 18:20.430
Someone targeted
Tyler, Josh, and Katie.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.014
VVhy?

18:22.143 --> 18:24.350
Revenge, jealousy, betrayal...

18:24.479 --> 18:26.185
You know, Greek tragedy stuff.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.850
I think it's all of the above.

18:27.983 --> 18:29.348
Uh, we got this, Lexie.

18:29.484 --> 18:33.898
No, I don't think you do,
Detective Woo—or—nose.

18:34.030 --> 18:34.860
Wuornos.

18:34.990 --> 18:37.527
Listen, I'm just saying
that when you were talking to Katie,

18:37.659 --> 18:39.615
I picked up a little bit of a guilt
vibe.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.486
I think she and Josh
were hooking up.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.038
Bartender.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.032
So could Tyler be our murderer?

18:48.169 --> 18:49.375
Tyler's paralyzed.

18:49.504 --> 18:51.495
He finds out his best friend
and girlfriend are cheating on him.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.371
—That's motive.
—Maybe Tyler lied.

18:53.508 --> 18:56.045
What if the accident
really was just an accident?

18:56.177 --> 18:57.883
But then he tries
to throw the blame on Katie,

18:58.013 --> 18:59.378
and he kills her and Josh.

18:59.514 --> 19:01.220
Let's pay him a visit.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.681
You up for this?

19:13.236 --> 19:14.476
Tyler.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.025
lt's Haven police again.
We need to talk.

19:20.035 --> 19:21.866
Tyler. Hey.

19:23.246 --> 19:25.237
Oh.

19:25.373 --> 19:27.204
Tyler is dead.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.164
It's not him.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.533
You said that he was a paraplegic.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.455
Where could he have gone?

19:32.130 --> 19:33.916
I'll try to find his nurse.

19:43.058 --> 19:45.891
The hospital just sent down
the security footage.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.010
Let's see what we got.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.910
It's like Tyler is controlling him.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.166
Where did they go?

20:31.272 --> 20:33.137
It's just like Josh and Katie.

20:33.274 --> 20:34.889
They weren't just brainwashed.

20:35.026 --> 20:37.813
Tyler took them over somehow,
possessed them.

20:37.946 --> 20:41.780
Like what, some kind
of supernatural puppet master?

20:41.908 --> 20:44.524
But why kill his poor orderly?

20:44.661 --> 20:46.902
Maybe he was tying up a loose end?

20:48.123 --> 20:49.329
Maybe Tyler needs to kill him

20:49.457 --> 20:51.698
so he can jump back
into his own body.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.752
Seizures...

21:03.888 --> 21:07.176
Looks like Tyler had one every time
he possessed somebody.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.720
He lost more of his motor function
every time, too.

21:09.853 --> 21:13.471
The more he uses his trouble,
the worse his own body gets.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.811
Does the rest of the world
know about this town?

21:18.361 --> 21:20.443
Just us lucky ones.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.110
—Duke, where are you?
—Upstairs.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.859
There's some psychopath in scrubs
following me.

21:27.996 --> 21:29.861
He's acting all twitchy
like that kid Josh was.

21:29.998 --> 21:31.329
What the hell's going on here?

21:31.458 --> 21:32.789
Tyler must know we're onto him.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.703
He's possessed someone else.

21:34.836 --> 21:38.249
Duke, that person's
an innocent victim, so don't engage.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.463
Duke?

21:44.596 --> 21:46.257
ln here!

21:49.851 --> 21:52.137
Okay, I engaged a little.

21:53.855 --> 21:55.561
He's fine.
I got him in here.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.851
Stay back.

22:15.126 --> 22:17.162
Move! Move!

22:19.881 --> 22:21.337
This was a trap.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.051
You're Tyler.

22:26.054 --> 22:27.840
Surprise.

22:30.767 --> 22:33.600
Give me your phones... now!

22:33.728 --> 22:35.514
—Give it to me.
—Oh.

22:36.648 --> 22:38.229
ljust got that.

22:39.609 --> 22:42.601
Your trouble kicked in
after the car crash, didn't it, Tyler?

22:42.737 --> 22:45.444
Then you figured out
how you could use it to kill Josh.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.279
Josh was an accident.

22:47.408 --> 22:50.775
l was lying there in that bed,
paralyzed,

22:50.912 --> 22:52.777
and then suddenly I was in Josh

22:52.914 --> 22:55.451
when he was out with my girlfriend,

22:55.583 --> 22:57.414
and I found out
what they were doing.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.159
So you killed them both
on purpose?

22:59.295 --> 23:00.501
My life was ruined!

23:00.630 --> 23:04.464
And they were supposed
to be my friends.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.257
But then I realized what I could do.

23:07.387 --> 23:08.627
It was my chance.

23:10.098 --> 23:11.884
They got what they had coming.

23:13.268 --> 23:15.805
You need things, don't you?
Objects?

23:15.937 --> 23:17.518
The real you holds on to something,

23:17.647 --> 23:20.309
and that lets you control
whoever gave it to you.

23:20.441 --> 23:23.148
When you possessed the orderly,
you were holding a remote ——

23:23.278 --> 23:24.734
He gave it to you.

23:24.862 --> 23:28.446
And Josh and Katie,
they gave you get—well cards.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.361
Duke gave you that drink ticket.

23:30.493 --> 23:33.906
Right after you gave me
your business card,

23:34.038 --> 23:35.778
so don't try anything.

23:36.791 --> 23:39.328
Tyler, you can't keep this up.

23:39.460 --> 23:40.666
It was on your charts.

23:40.795 --> 23:44.504
Your real body is falling apart
the more you possess people.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.340
You're gonna die.

23:47.468 --> 23:49.845
Which is why I'm trading my body in
for this one...

23:49.971 --> 23:51.177
Permanently.

23:51.306 --> 23:52.716
Now, get in there.

23:54.809 --> 23:56.424
Or I'll shoot your girlfriend.

23:56.561 --> 23:57.641
Now.

23:58.813 --> 24:00.349
—Move.
—Okay.

24:11.492 --> 24:12.823
This is what Vince, Dave, and l
have been working on

24:12.952 --> 24:14.362
for the last six months...

24:14.495 --> 24:16.110
Another way to end the troubles.

24:19.167 --> 24:20.532
So what did you find?

24:20.668 --> 24:22.579
Nothing.

24:23.838 --> 24:25.453
Everything Nathan is saying is true.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.330
Lexie needs to kill the man she loves.

24:27.467 --> 24:30.209
So we just sit around
and wait for them to fall in love?

24:30.345 --> 24:32.836
I mean, it's preposterous.

24:34.932 --> 24:38.766
Sarah, Lucy, Audrey, Lexie...

24:38.895 --> 24:43.059
Whoever she is, she always
comes with the troubles.

24:43.941 --> 24:45.397
Does anyone ever stop to ask

24:45.526 --> 24:47.357
if maybe the troubles
are her trouble?

24:47.487 --> 24:49.773
No. No, she solves troubles.

24:49.906 --> 24:54.821
lf Duke Crocker kills someone,
their trouble ends.

24:55.536 --> 24:57.072
So what if he killed Lexie?

24:57.205 --> 24:58.866
Would all the troubles end?

24:58.998 --> 25:00.829
Nothing we have found
says that would work,

25:00.958 --> 25:02.823
not —— not a single thing.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.621
Anything say it wouldn't?

25:04.754 --> 25:08.212
Duke would never kill her,
not in a million years.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.157
Back so soon, little brother?

25:36.744 --> 25:39.360
What's the, uh, trouble du jour?

25:40.248 --> 25:42.455
You gonna fill me in, huh?

25:45.670 --> 25:47.126
Figures.

25:47.255 --> 25:49.667
Why would you let me help?

25:49.799 --> 25:51.915
Actually, maybe you can help.

25:53.261 --> 25:55.252
See, t—there's this, um...

25:55.388 --> 25:58.630
this troubled guy
who can possess people.

25:58.766 --> 26:01.098
Really?
Wow. That can happen?

26:01.227 --> 26:03.934
—Weird, right?
—Yeah.

26:04.063 --> 26:08.306
Yeah, he —— he can jump
into another person's body

26:08.443 --> 26:10.149
and control them for a while,

26:10.278 --> 26:14.021
but then, whoosh,

26:14.157 --> 26:15.988
he ends up back in his old body.

26:16.117 --> 26:17.482
He's trying to figure out
how to keep that from...

26:17.618 --> 26:20.860
...happening, how to stay
in the other person's body.

26:20.997 --> 26:22.737
Well, maybe if he, uh,

26:22.874 --> 26:27.334
I don't know, kills the old body,
he can stay in the new one.

26:29.130 --> 26:31.166
That'd be a really good idea.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.089
Thank you.

26:34.218 --> 26:38.131
You've actually been very helpful.

26:43.144 --> 26:44.680
Duke?

26:45.521 --> 26:47.432
It's not you, is it?

26:51.652 --> 26:54.485
No, it's not.

26:59.911 --> 27:02.368
Do you have a safe here?

27:12.006 --> 27:14.713
Door, three.
War—noss, zip.

27:14.842 --> 27:17.083
Wuornos. lt...

27:17.220 --> 27:18.710
Oh, right.

27:18.846 --> 27:21.758
Oh, you're funny.

27:22.350 --> 27:23.715
I've been told.

27:23.851 --> 27:27.719
It's good to have a sense of humor
to put up with all this crazy stuff.

27:27.855 --> 27:30.892
Well, if you're not laughing,
you're crying, right?

27:31.025 --> 27:32.390
You know what would be
so good right now?

27:32.527 --> 27:34.392
Some hard drugs.

27:34.529 --> 27:37.612
Some mescaline, peyote,
some scotch.

27:37.740 --> 27:40.652
—You've done peyote?
—Sure.

27:40.785 --> 27:43.572
This morning I flew through
a multidimensional door, okay?

27:43.704 --> 27:45.410
I think peyote makes sense.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.455
Don't go all cop on me.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.245
No...

27:51.087 --> 27:52.998
I'm just glad you're feeling better.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.255
You know, when we get ——

28:00.388 --> 28:02.845
we get out of here,
maybe we could get some food...

28:02.974 --> 28:05.590
Maybe some pancakes.

28:05.726 --> 28:07.307
Pancakes?

28:08.312 --> 28:09.427
[Retching]

28:17.780 --> 28:19.691
You son of a bitch.

28:19.824 --> 28:21.064
What happened to Duke?

28:21.200 --> 28:22.940
He's still in here.

28:23.494 --> 28:25.280
He's just...

28:25.413 --> 28:27.449
riding in the backseat.

28:28.916 --> 28:31.373
Thanks to you,
I think we know how to fix that now.

28:31.502 --> 28:32.958
First, the safe.

28:33.087 --> 28:35.453
Now, do you want
to tell me where it is,

28:35.590 --> 28:37.546
or do l have to beat it out of you?

28:41.262 --> 28:43.844
And now we're out of time.

28:48.769 --> 28:50.976
Duke, l have made up my mind,

28:51.105 --> 28:53.096
and don't try to talk me out of it.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.517
Okay.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.436
I'm going back to Boston.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.060
Have fun.

29:00.031 --> 29:04.115
Okay, well, you could try
to talk me out of it just a little.

29:04.952 --> 29:07.159
I'm sorry.

29:07.288 --> 29:08.653
I must have misunderstood.

29:08.789 --> 29:11.326
Actually, um...

29:11.459 --> 29:13.575
I'm leaving town, too.

29:16.130 --> 29:18.337
What do you think
about coming with me?

29:18.466 --> 29:21.333
Okay, I think, um...

29:21.469 --> 29:23.050
But where are we...

29:25.932 --> 29:28.014
Uh, great. Just...

29:28.142 --> 29:30.349
A little fast.

29:31.479 --> 29:32.935
Are you sure about this?

29:33.064 --> 29:34.725
Absolutely.

29:35.650 --> 29:37.891
Okay, um,
I just need to get my things.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.943
We can get new things.

29:42.823 --> 29:46.486
Okay.
Yeah, I can be spontaneous.

29:46.619 --> 29:48.530
| just need to make a quick stop.

29:50.665 --> 29:52.872
I need to pay an old friend
a final visit.

30:02.009 --> 30:04.625
Okay, this clearly is not working.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.426
What are you doing?

30:13.562 --> 30:16.895
I've picked a few handcuffs
in my day.

30:18.484 --> 30:19.985
You get arrested a lot?

30:20.111 --> 30:21.066
No.

30:21.195 --> 30:24.187
No, | just had a boyfriend
who was really into bondage.

30:35.209 --> 30:36.665
You getting a good look?

30:45.886 --> 30:47.467
You know I'm not her, right?

30:47.596 --> 30:49.336
Yeah,ldo.

30:49.473 --> 30:51.759
You're a completely different person,
and I don't want you.

30:51.892 --> 30:53.974
I want you to be Audrey again.

30:56.689 --> 30:58.771
I'm sorry. I know
that's a terrible thing to say.

30:58.899 --> 31:01.231
That's just how I feel.

31:35.102 --> 31:37.809
Uh, what are we doing
at the hospital?

31:37.938 --> 31:39.929
Am I gonna have
to flash my boobs again?

31:40.858 --> 31:42.564
Okay.

31:45.529 --> 31:47.110
What's wrong, babe?

31:48.991 --> 31:50.947
"Babe"?

31:51.952 --> 31:53.488
I thought you were acting
kind of funny.

31:53.621 --> 31:55.282
Maybe a little drunk, but...

31:58.626 --> 32:00.867
I swear you've been infected
by a trouble.

32:16.143 --> 32:18.759
I don't know who you really are,
but I will shoot you,

32:18.896 --> 32:20.511
and I'll probably accidentally
hit you in the face,

32:20.648 --> 32:22.138
so don't come near me.

32:30.658 --> 32:31.317
Thank God!

32:31.450 --> 32:33.691
Duke just went inside,
but it wasn't Duke.

32:33.828 --> 32:35.318
Yeah, he's been possessed.

32:37.456 --> 32:38.832
I'm getting used to it.

32:38.958 --> 32:40.038
Wade just called me.

32:40.167 --> 32:42.374
He said Tyler wants to stay
in Duke's body permanently,

32:42.503 --> 32:44.835
and he thinks he's got to kill
his actual body to do it.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.329
And this guy's body
is still in the hospital.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.376
Yes, gone through every bit
of security footage.

32:48.509 --> 32:50.795
The orderly that moved Tyler
never left the building.

32:50.928 --> 32:53.385
And someone accessed
the basement at the same time.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.714
What? I was ——
l was eavesdropping.

32:56.851 --> 32:58.807
So what are you waiting for?
Go save Duke!

32:58.936 --> 33:00.472
You didn't give Duke anything,
did you?

33:00.604 --> 33:02.856
Something he could take in
to Tyler's body?

33:02.982 --> 33:06.065
I left my pen in his leg.

33:06.193 --> 33:09.230
So he could take control
of you, too —— any of us.

33:09.363 --> 33:10.569
But isn't she immune
to the troubles?

33:10.698 --> 33:12.689
I mean, they don't affect her,
like Audrey.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.033
Okay. I get it.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.910
Is that why I'm so important
to all of you people,

33:19.039 --> 33:22.577
'cause I'm immune
to these trouble things?

33:22.710 --> 33:25.747
—What else can I do?
—That's a lot.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.836
All right, then maybe
I should go in there by myself.

33:27.965 --> 33:30.081
No, you're not going in there
on your own.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.424
Tyler can't control me, all right?

33:32.553 --> 33:37.047
| go in there, I take Duke's
drink ticket out of Tyler's hand,

33:37.183 --> 33:38.719
we get Duke back,

33:38.851 --> 33:40.387
and | get a free drink.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.384
No.

33:43.189 --> 33:45.601
Okay, I have a question for you.

33:45.733 --> 33:49.442
Is all of this real,
all this trouble insanity?

33:50.404 --> 33:51.393
Yes, it's real.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.395
Then maybe I need to be here.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.488
This is what I'm supposed
to be doing.

33:56.327 --> 33:57.783
That makes sense to me.

33:57.912 --> 34:00.619
I'm the only shot you have
at saving your friend.

34:00.748 --> 34:03.080
Tyler can control you,
and then you would turn on me.

34:03.209 --> 34:04.790
Do you want to take that chance,

34:04.919 --> 34:06.875
or do you want
to take a chance on me?

34:09.590 --> 34:11.296
Here.

34:11.425 --> 34:14.132
Three minutes, then I'm coming in.

34:15.471 --> 34:18.634
All right.
Got it, Dudley do—right.

34:51.298 --> 34:53.789
You'll be dead before you ever
get that thing out of my hand.

34:55.511 --> 34:56.591
You think by killing yourself,

34:56.720 --> 34:59.587
you'll be left in control
of Duke's body?

34:59.723 --> 35:01.679
Well, what if it doesn't work?

35:03.811 --> 35:05.267
What choice do l have?

35:05.396 --> 35:07.307
My body is ruined!

35:08.399 --> 35:11.061
There is no going back for me now.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.603
Maybe for you, too.

35:19.535 --> 35:22.117
How well do you really know
this guy?

35:23.539 --> 35:25.871
I mean, is he really worth dying for?

35:31.171 --> 35:32.581
I'm sorry, Duke.

35:42.766 --> 35:44.222
What's happening to me?

35:48.522 --> 35:50.558
What is this?

35:50.691 --> 35:51.976
I can't stop it!

36:07.708 --> 36:09.494
Tyler?

36:10.711 --> 36:12.952
Relax, sweetheart.

36:14.131 --> 36:15.587
It's me.

36:15.716 --> 36:17.832
Oh, God.

36:19.553 --> 36:22.545
Do you remember anything?

36:25.059 --> 36:26.765
All of it.

36:28.312 --> 36:30.928
It was like I was a fly
on my own wall the whole time.

36:31.065 --> 36:32.646
What just happened?

36:32.775 --> 36:35.687
And what was going on
with your eyes?

36:35.819 --> 36:37.775
My family curse.

36:37.905 --> 36:42.365
When I kill a troubled person,
I kill their trouble, too.

36:42.493 --> 36:45.985
When he died,
Tyler couldn't control me anymore.

36:46.121 --> 36:48.612
He accidentally ended
his own curse.

36:48.749 --> 36:51.240
All right, well, that's good to know.

36:51.377 --> 36:55.245
I've got a ——
got a lot to learn here.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.087
Yeah.

36:58.258 --> 37:00.169
That was a close one.

37:10.437 --> 37:12.553
[Knocking on door]

37:14.942 --> 37:17.149
All this is Audrey's, huh?

37:17.277 --> 37:20.235
She was really good
at this trouble stuff.

37:22.408 --> 37:24.194
Very good.

37:26.537 --> 37:27.993
It seems you're good, too.

37:28.122 --> 37:30.613
No, | just got lucky.

37:30.749 --> 37:34.662
Duke could have died,
and he should've for all I did.

37:34.795 --> 37:38.128
You went in there.
You tried.

37:39.550 --> 37:41.791
That means a lot.

37:43.971 --> 37:46.337
So I've heard the whispers.

37:46.473 --> 37:50.182
You had something,
you and her.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.346
We had something.

37:52.479 --> 37:55.061
Did you and Audrey knock boots?

37:56.817 --> 37:58.853
Did you make sweet love?

38:02.197 --> 38:03.778
lt's, uh...

38:03.907 --> 38:06.193
...complicated.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.282
"Complicated" is what
all the married guys tell me

38:08.412 --> 38:10.619
when they want to sleep with me.

38:14.501 --> 38:19.040
But I'm guessing with you, though,
it really is complicated.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.705
You'd be right.

38:23.010 --> 38:24.671
Okay.

38:40.194 --> 38:41.934
Wade...

38:44.281 --> 38:46.237
You know that wasn't me.

38:46.366 --> 38:47.572
I should've known it wasn't you

38:47.701 --> 38:51.319
when you actually seemed
interested in what I had to say.

38:52.623 --> 38:54.409
But I did call the cops.

38:54.541 --> 38:56.247
I saved your ass.

38:56.376 --> 38:58.913
So you could show me
some gratitude

38:59.046 --> 39:02.163
and tell me
what the big secret is about you.

39:02.299 --> 39:06.417
And lam doing you a favor
by not sharing it.

39:25.906 --> 39:28.067
He just wants to help.

39:29.326 --> 39:31.408
l'm protecting him.

39:32.329 --> 39:34.194
Nothing good is gonna come
from him finding out

39:34.331 --> 39:35.867
about our family curse.

39:35.999 --> 39:39.617
| just hope that he eventually does
what's best for himself

39:39.753 --> 39:41.664
and he leaves this place.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.544
I heard what you said to Tyler.

39:48.554 --> 39:50.010
You're going back to Boston?

39:51.557 --> 39:52.637
lam.

39:52.766 --> 39:56.258
Well, Lexie's gonna take
Audrey's old room upstairs, so...

40:00.357 --> 40:05.147
But if you wanted,
l have an extra room in my boat.

40:07.447 --> 40:09.608
Stay.

40:11.994 --> 40:14.485
I don't care if the barn is gone.

40:14.621 --> 40:18.660
Besides, you can make up
for what you did to my leg.

40:19.626 --> 40:22.618
You remember everything
that "puppet Duke" did?

40:23.297 --> 40:24.252
Mm—hmm.

40:24.381 --> 40:26.087
You kissed me.

40:26.633 --> 40:29.625
You kissed me back.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.311
Let me guess.

40:43.567 --> 40:45.808
You're waiting for my brother.

40:46.486 --> 40:48.317
Nope.

40:51.742 --> 40:53.733
I'm waiting for you.

41:03.337 --> 41:06.044
So I used to live here?

41:06.840 --> 41:08.205
What was I, broke?

41:09.176 --> 41:11.883
I mean, it's nice and everything.
It's a little nautical.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.053
Well, I'm glad you like it.

41:16.099 --> 41:18.135
You owe me six months' rent.

41:18.268 --> 41:19.383
[Laughs]

41:19.519 --> 41:21.726
| just tried to save your life.

41:21.855 --> 41:23.846
Shouldn't | get the first month free?

41:25.984 --> 41:27.565
You know, I've been thinking
about what happened

41:27.694 --> 41:29.605
down in that basement.

41:31.448 --> 41:34.906
You just stepped aside
and let Tyler try to take me.

41:35.035 --> 41:37.321
I don't know what to say.

41:37.454 --> 41:39.945
I'm sorry. ljust, l...

41:40.082 --> 41:42.824
I didn't want to get stabbed.
l was scared.

41:42.959 --> 41:44.790
See, that's where | get stuck.

41:46.213 --> 41:48.499
The way you jumped
out of that barn,

41:48.632 --> 41:51.044
went down in that basement...

41:52.678 --> 41:54.589
I guess I'm just having
a hard time believing

41:54.721 --> 41:56.177
that you were scared.

41:57.766 --> 42:01.475
I think you knew that my curse
would kick in and save me.

42:01.603 --> 42:03.639
I really... I don't know
the first thing about it.

42:03.772 --> 42:05.478
But Audrey Parker would.

42:12.489 --> 42:16.277
Isn't that right, Audrey?

42:23.959 --> 42:26.075
Damn it, Duke.

42:30.674 --> 42:32.289
Yeah.

42:32.426 --> 42:34.917
It's me.
