- When you're young

02:06.459 --> 02:08.710
and the woman in your hands
is young,

02:08.836 --> 02:11.547
you're provoked
by the life in her skin;

02:11.673 --> 02:13.507
in the muscles under her skin.

02:13.633 --> 02:14.883
You can smell life

02:15.009 --> 02:16.927
in the sweet perfume
of her sweat,

02:17.053 --> 02:18.262
in her breath,

02:18.388 --> 02:19.972
sweet perfume
that can make you dizzy.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.141
You can sense life
in the jittery convulsions

02:22.267 --> 02:25.144
of her reaction to every
new touch and sensation.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.604
And you feel young and alive

02:27.730 --> 02:30.774

every time you come near her.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.192
But the older you get,

02:32.318 --> 02:33.944
the older
the woman in your hands gets,

02:34.070 --> 02:35.737
you grow lulled
by the lazy response

02:35.864 --> 02:37.573
of her flesh to your touch,

02:37.699 --> 02:41.160
lulled by the numb response
of your own nerves to her flesh,

02:41.286 --> 02:43.078
by the sluggish torpor
of her muscles;

02:43.204 --> 02:44.913
the souring perfume
of her sweat;

02:45.039 --> 02:46.415
of her tears;

02:46.541 --> 02:48.750

of her old guts

02:48.877 --> 02:50.586
belching out air.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.130
And it's a curse,

02:53.256 --> 02:54.923
because getting older
doesn't make you

02:55.049 --> 02:56.550

02:56.676 --> 02:58.677

when you were young.

02:58.803 --> 02:59.928

03:00.054 --> 03:01.388

or the forbidden.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.308
She's just old,

03:04.434 --> 03:05.726
and she reminds you
that you're old

03:05.852 --> 03:08.395
and that your old shell
is still taking up space

03:08.521 --> 03:11.481
but that its life
is almost gone.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.983
But nothing's worse

03:13.109 --> 03:14.818
than being old
and holding youth in your hands,

03:14.944 --> 03:17.237
even youth that's
thrilled by the novelty of you.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.489
Because you can still
smell youth's sweetness,

under her taut skin,

03:22.118 --> 03:24.244

03:24.370 --> 03:25.954
You're not sharing in it

03:26.080 --> 03:28.415
but are feeding off it
like some kind of vampire.

03:28.541 --> 03:29.958
And you wonder
what the point is,

03:30.084 --> 03:31.418
what the point
of going on living,

03:31.544 --> 03:33.253
the point of loving,
the point of touching.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.922
And all your instincts,
your training,

03:35.048 --> 03:36.632
have made you too afraid
to pull the trigger

03:36.758 --> 03:38.217
and end it yourself,

03:38.343 --> 03:40.260
to take responsibility
that nature has abdicated

03:40.386 --> 03:42.679
into your own trembling,
weakening hands.

03:42.805 --> 03:45.098
You stare at those hands,

03:45.225 --> 03:46.767
studying them,
wondering what they are,

03:46.893 --> 03:49.436
why you can't make them
do what you want them to do.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.188
You stare down at your hands

03:51.314 --> 03:54.441
and you realize
that even your own hands

03:54.567 --> 03:56.610
aren't really yours anymore.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.779
And you look up from your hand
into the mirror

03:58.905 --> 04:00.447
and you see a face
that you recognize,

04:00.573 --> 04:02.616
a face that you've been
staring at for your entire life,

04:02.742 --> 04:04.368

04:04.494 --> 04:05.953
and you remember
that the face is yours,

04:06.079 --> 04:08.413
but you have no idea
who you are anymore.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.040
And the person you once were

04:10.166 --> 04:13.585
who had any kind of cohesiveness
or connection to himself

04:13.711 --> 04:16.630

04:16.755 --> 04:18.382

gonna have to throw them out.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.864
- All right, l'll take them out.
l'll take them out.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.157
Okay, all right.
l take them out.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.533
- l'm gonna go to the bathroom.

12:23.659 --> 12:25.076
Does anybody
need to use the bathroom?

12:25.202 --> 12:26.327
- No.
- No.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.787
- 'Cause l'm gonna use it,

12:27.913 --> 12:29.372
so if anybody needs to use it,
use it now.

12:29.498 --> 12:32.584
- lt's fine.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.669
Mom, why do you let him
push you around like that?

12:34.795 --> 12:37.213
- lt's okay,
l just put too many yams on.

12:37.339 --> 12:38.757
- What-

12:38.883 --> 12:40.675
You shouldn't
be cooking for him anyway.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.094
He shouldn't even
be living here.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.429
- You haven't seen him
for a while.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.681
You don't know how weak he is.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.933
- He's better now,
but you don't see him.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.435
He's been so weak.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.437
- l see him.
l'm here, aren't l?

12:52.563 --> 12:53.813
- You don't see him
the way l see him.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.607
You don't see how weak he is.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.776
- He's weak because you let him
get away with being weak.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.527
You don't ask him
to do anything.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.780
How long are you gonna let him
emotionally blackmail you?

13:01.906 --> 13:03.656
Can't you just stop it?

13:03.783 --> 13:06.284
[toilet flushes]

13:06.410 --> 13:07.660
- How about you?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.454
You still
seeing that beautiful girl?

13:09.580 --> 13:10.705
- No.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.373
- Well, but she wasn't for you.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.167
l didn't say anything,
but she wasn't for you.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.878
- lf she was,
l guess she'd be here, huh?

13:17.004 --> 13:18.880
- You need someone
who's more your equal.

13:19.006 --> 13:20.882
- Equal in what?

13:21.008 --> 13:22.717
lt's not a competition, is it?

13:22.843 --> 13:24.385
You need to find someone
who can-

13:24.512 --> 13:25.678
Someone who can help you.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.555
- Help me?
She left me.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.849
Maybe l didn't have anything
to give to her, mom.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.309
You ever thought about that?
- Hmmph.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.394
- Maybe l have nothing
to give to anyone.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.563
That ever crossed your mind?

13:35.689 --> 13:37.732
- You just need to find
the right girl.

13:37.858 --> 13:41.569
- So how's work?

13:41.695 --> 13:43.571
- l'm not working.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.156
- lt's important
to keep working.

13:45.282 --> 13:46.908
- Why? What's so great
about work?

13:47.034 --> 13:50.078
You work all the time.
What's so great about your life?

13:50.204 --> 13:52.163
- l'm alive.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.832
- After the war,

13:53.958 --> 13:56.251
when l came back to Paris
living with my mother,

13:56.377 --> 13:58.586
men chased me
all around the city.

13:58.712 --> 13:59.921
l didn't care.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.339
l wanted my freedom.

14:01.465 --> 14:02.715
- Mom!

14:02.842 --> 14:04.259
l'm gonna start
the carrots now, Mom.

14:04.385 --> 14:07.136
- The more l ignored them,
the more they chased me.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.388
The more they chased me,

14:08.514 --> 14:10.056
the less l wanted them.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.725
There was a boy,
a handsome boy from Sweden,

14:12.852 --> 14:14.227
whose family
had a lot of money-

14:14.353 --> 14:15.562
millionaires.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.063
l didn't care.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.399
He wanted me to marry him.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.733
He asked me to marry him
every day.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.443
- That's how she tells it.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.488
- But l finally told him
l don't want to see him anymore.

14:25.614 --> 14:28.575
But then his mother called
one night, crying,

14:28.701 --> 14:32.745
saying he was with a gun
in his room,

14:32.872 --> 14:34.747
and he was
going to kill himself

14:34.874 --> 14:37.083
unless l went to see him.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.587
l told her, he can kill himself
if he wants to.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.505
l am not going to see him.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.340
And l hung up the phone.

14:44.466 --> 14:47.594
No one was going to pin me down,
not me.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.430
Your yams are on the stove,
two of them.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.224
You can finish it yourself.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.475
[sighs]

14:54.602 --> 14:59.439
Oh, you'll find
the right girl.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.524
- Yeah, you know what?
l-

15:01.650 --> 15:03.860
l know you cooked
and everything,

15:03.986 --> 15:05.153
but l'm gonna go.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.404
- Are you gonna leave
this house

15:06.530 --> 15:08.406
without giving your mother
a kiss?

15:08.532 --> 15:10.033
- l'm gonna be late for school.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.035
- First go give your mother
a good morning kiss.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.912
- Maybe you can
give her a kiss today.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.163
- l kiss her,

15:15.289 --> 15:16.623
but to start her day,

15:16.749 --> 15:18.541
she needs a good morning kiss
from you.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.376
- l can give her a kiss.

15:20.502 --> 15:22.545
- You can kiss her after school.

15:22.671 --> 15:25.715
ln the morning, she needs a kiss
from your big brother.

15:25.841 --> 15:28.176
Now, come on.
Let's get your things.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.546
[engine speeds closer]

16:05.673 --> 16:06.965
Slap!
- Oh!

16:07.091 --> 16:08.341
[grunts]
No.

16:08.467 --> 16:11.511
[grunting]

16:15.265 --> 16:16.391
slap!
Oh, God, so good.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.059
slap!
[gasps]

16:18.185 --> 16:21.854
[moaning]

16:21.981 --> 16:23.815
No.
[panting]

16:23.941 --> 16:25.858
Mm.
Mm.

16:25.985 --> 16:29.028
[whimpers]

16:29.154 --> 16:31.447
Mm, no.
[gasps]

16:31.573 --> 16:32.824
[moans]

16:32.950 --> 16:35.952
[gasping]

16:38.664 --> 16:39.789
[panting]

16:39.915 --> 16:42.458
[moaning]

16:48.340 --> 16:50.508
[both moaning]

16:53.721 --> 16:54.971
What are you doing?

16:55.097 --> 16:56.389
- What do you mean,
"What am l doing?"

16:56.515 --> 16:58.057
l want to make love to you.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.059
- We can't do that.
- What?

17:00.185 --> 17:01.519
- You've been
with too many girls.

17:01.645 --> 17:04.063
- l haven't been
with that many girls.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.690
- Too many girls.

17:05.816 --> 17:09.193
- l haven't.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.362
- Too many girls.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.367
[both groan]
thud!

17:29.173 --> 17:32.216
Too many girls.

17:32.342 --> 17:33.468
[keys jingle]

17:33.594 --> 17:34.719
- Hey.

17:34.845 --> 17:38.389
Sorry-sorry if l scared you.

17:38.515 --> 17:41.392
l let myself in.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.519
l just couldn't-

17:47.024 --> 17:50.902
- Hey.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.695
Hey, what's going on?

17:58.035 --> 18:01.662
- l just can't deal
with Mom and Dad.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.998
l'm going crazy.
[sniffles]

18:04.124 --> 18:06.292
l mean, they put on a show
when you come over,

18:06.418 --> 18:07.710
but they're fighting
all the time.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.420
And then when he tries
to be nice to her

18:09.546 --> 18:11.089
and get close to her,

18:11.215 --> 18:14.175
she goes and calls her guys,
you know, her friends,

18:14.301 --> 18:15.510
and makes plans with them.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.345
- She makes plans
and does nothing.

18:17.471 --> 18:20.181
She's an ice queen.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.016
- lce queen, with that temper?

18:22.142 --> 18:23.684
- The deeper the ice,
the louder it cracks.

18:23.811 --> 18:27.021
She's frigid.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.690
You know, l don't think
she's ever had an orgasm, man.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.192
- Hey.
Hey, it's all right.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.236
You don't
have to talk like that.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.696
- l don't think she's had sex
with Dad since you were born.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.324
But who cares?
lt's their life.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.826
You shouldn't be there anyway.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.661
- l know,
but l don't know what to do.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.788
- You should start working.
That's what you should do.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.706
Get out in the world
and make a living.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.209
Play some music, man;
make some money.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.086
Do something so you
can get the hell out of there.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.796
- You think it's so easy.
l mean, l'm trying.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.507
- You don't give me any credit.
- Credit?

18:54.633 --> 18:56.759
- You know, it's a miracle
l'm not in a hospital right now.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.594
- lt's because you won't eat.
Why won't you eat?

18:58.720 --> 19:00.388
You have to eat
like a normal human being.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.432
Just please fucking eat
like a normal human being.

19:03.559 --> 19:04.976
Stop making Mom

19:05.102 --> 19:06.853
cook yams and potatoes
for you all the time.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.939
Start taking care of yourself.
Jesus, man, come on.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.866
Look, you should stay here.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.368
- [sniffling]

19:22.494 --> 19:25.246
Okay, thanks.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.747
l'll sleep on the couch.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.166
l'll be gone
by the time you wake up-

19:28.292 --> 19:31.002
- No, l mean, you should-

19:31.128 --> 19:32.545
you should come
live in this apartment

19:32.671 --> 19:34.881
and get out of Mom and Dad's.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.383
- Well, l-l don't know
if now is such a good time.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.218
l mean, they're not
getting along,

19:39.344 --> 19:40.553
and she's really on edge.

19:40.679 --> 19:41.888
l wouldn't want
to rock the boat.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.222
- Rock the boat?

19:43.348 --> 19:47.059
Jesus,
this will steady the boat.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.270
Get out of there
and come stay here.

19:49.396 --> 19:50.563
- Well, this place is tiny.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.856
You've got girls to bring over.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.191
- l won't be here.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.067
- What do you mean?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.737
- l mean, l'm staying
at this woman's place anyway.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.405
- Well, l thought
you broke up with-

19:59.531 --> 20:02.074
- No, no, no, not her.
The, um-

20:02.201 --> 20:03.993
the Asian one.

20:04.119 --> 20:06.078
You remember her?

20:06.205 --> 20:07.705
- Oh, yeah.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.040
Do l?
She's, like, wild.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.499
- There's a lot of them
out there, man.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.043
They're all over the place.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.711
l mean, the world's crawling
with Asian-

20:13.837 --> 20:15.379
- Not for me.
- What do you mean, not for you?

20:15.505 --> 20:17.423
Of course not for you
unless you get out of the house.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.883
You've got
to get out of the house-

20:19.009 --> 20:20.593
- Okay, let's just
not talk about it, okay?

20:20.719 --> 20:22.511
l mean, yeah, l'll move in here,

20:22.638 --> 20:25.223
but if you're gonna pressure me
about girls and about going out,

20:25.349 --> 20:27.433
then l'll just-l won't;
you know, l'll go back.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.268
- Hey, look, all right.
- l don't need to be here.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.604
- Take it easy.
l'm not pressuring you.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.941
We're just having
a conversation, okay?

20:35.067 --> 20:37.944
Just get all your shit
and come stay here.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.782
- Well, what about my piano?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.292
- We'll get the movers
and bring it here.

20:53.418 --> 20:57.797
You can, um. . .

20:57.923 --> 20:59.757
you can move all that shit
away from the wall there

20:59.883 --> 21:01.884
and put it there.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.386
All right?

21:07.307 --> 21:08.724
- Hi.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.394
- l'd like to take a room
for the month.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.728
- Oh, we don't rent
by the month.

21:12.854 --> 21:14.230
Daily rates only.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.232
- l always stay here monthly.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.693
- Maybe you used to,
but we don't do that anymore.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.236
- Can l talk to the manager?

21:20.362 --> 21:21.696
- l am the manager.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.739
- What happened
to the other manager?

21:23.865 --> 21:26.826
- l don't know; maybe he's
managing some other hotel.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.995
There are still a few in town
that offer monthly rates,

21:29.121 --> 21:30.413
but l wouldn't recommend them.

This is your wake-up call.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.877

Hi.
Hi.

24:13.326 --> 24:15.536
l couldn't help but notice
what a great mother you are.

24:15.662 --> 24:17.121
Don't-don't worry.
l'm not weird;

24:17.247 --> 24:18.664
l'm not trying to pick you up.

24:18.790 --> 24:19.999
l'm an agent with A&M,

24:20.125 --> 24:21.584
and l just couldn't help
but notice you.

24:21.710 --> 24:22.835
- A&M?

24:22.961 --> 24:24.628
- Actors and Models Agency.

24:24.754 --> 24:27.173
We specialize in real people who
have a little something extra.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.633
We do Christmas catalogs
and commercials,

24:29.759 --> 24:30.885
that kind of thing.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.386
l just couldn't help notice

24:32.512 --> 24:34.263
how radiant you look
tending to your son.

24:34.389 --> 24:36.390
But we're for real.
l promise.

24:36.516 --> 24:38.058
You can check us out
with the BBB.

24:38.185 --> 24:39.518
- BBB?
What?

24:39.644 --> 24:41.270
- Better Business Bureau.

24:41.396 --> 24:43.272
l don't tend to scope out
new clients on the street,

24:43.398 --> 24:44.607
but l guess
it's like

24:44.733 --> 24:46.317
an ingrained instinct
at this point.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.319
lf you're interested
in doing some modeling work,

24:48.445 --> 24:50.362
stop by our offices 9:00
in the morning on Saturday.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.198
That's when
we do our open calls.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.325
- You used to be able to see
the sky here when l was a kid.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.327
Now it's like you're this mouse
in a gigantic maze.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.120
- Oh, that's putting it nicely.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.372
- Yeah, but some people still
stick it out, though, right?

25:00.499 --> 25:01.874
l mean,
people who have an inner shine

25:02.000 --> 25:03.417
that the city
doesn't beat out of them.

25:03.543 --> 25:04.960
l guess l notice that
'cause of my work.

25:05.086 --> 25:06.337
- Your work?

25:06.463 --> 25:08.214
- l guess
l got a little comfortable,

25:08.340 --> 25:10.883
started sitting on my ass
and letting girls find me.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.093
Girls with the freshest faces,
like yourself,

25:13.220 --> 25:16.222
aren't necessarily planning
on doing something like this.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.098
Finding something real

25:18.225 --> 25:20.601
keeps me interested
in what l'm doing, so-

25:20.727 --> 25:22.394
Thank you all for coming.
l know it's early.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.896
Some of you have met me before,

25:24.022 --> 25:25.523
and it's nice to see you again.

25:25.649 --> 25:27.525
Others have found us
in a number of different ways.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.944
Go ahead and pass those around.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.362
Today l and several
of my colleagues

25:31.488 --> 25:33.155
will be evaluating you
personally,

25:33.281 --> 25:35.366
but first l wanted to say
a few words to you as a group.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.076
And you should
look around the group,

25:37.202 --> 25:39.078
because you'll see
a lot of girls just like you,

25:39.204 --> 25:43.415
girls who aren't necessarily
going to be supermodels

25:43.542 --> 25:45.960
but who have
a special something

25:46.086 --> 25:48.295
that sets you apart,
something real.

25:48.421 --> 25:49.838
We're in the big city.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.465
And if you're looking
to be a supermodel,

25:51.591 --> 25:52.716
you probably shouldn't be here.

25:52.842 --> 25:54.260
We're not a star agency.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.762
But we work hard,
and we like where we are.

25:56.888 --> 25:59.098
Now, l am not promising you
the moon.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.849
l'm not promising you anything.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.851
But if we decide
to work with you,

26:02.978 --> 26:05.104
we'll match the level
of your commitment.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.897
lf you're just here
to get a few photos taken,

26:07.023 --> 26:10.192
give it a go for a few weeks,
thank you for coming.

26:10.318 --> 26:12.361
You're probably not for us.

26:12.487 --> 26:14.029
But. . .

26:14.155 --> 26:17.866
if you're truly committed,

26:17.993 --> 26:19.868
you'll find
you have a hell of a partner.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.120
You'll need headshots.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.496
And for you, with your figure,

26:22.622 --> 26:24.456
l'd suggest
full body shots as well.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.792
Of course, you're free to go
to any photographer you'd like,

26:26.918 --> 26:28.460
but here's
a list of photographers

26:28.587 --> 26:30.129
we highly recommend.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.548
This guy really gets results
right here.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.050
This guy, he's great too,
but he's a little pricey.

26:35.176 --> 26:36.719
And this studio's excellent,

26:36.845 --> 26:38.262
particularly
for actors' headshots.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.389
Do you have
any acting experience?

26:40.515 --> 26:42.141
That's probably for the best.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.685
Of course, there are a few
tricks that are good to know.

26:44.811 --> 26:47.563
Help you be comfortable in
auditions, make an impression.

26:47.689 --> 26:50.107
Help the real you come out.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.734
l used to take classes myself.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.360
Now l actually teach one.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.237
lt might cost a little something
extra at first,

26:55.363 --> 26:57.489
but l'll tell you,
it's worth it in the long run.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.283
Would you like a brochure?

27:05.290 --> 27:06.665
- You got
right back on the saddle.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.334
How long has it been
since you last worked?

27:08.460 --> 27:10.169
- Actually l got thrown
for a second there.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.545
Did something change
around here?

27:11.671 --> 27:13.297
Who brought in
all those lookers?

27:18.428 --> 27:19.678
ls he a new partner?

27:19.804 --> 27:21.305
- He's on commission,

27:21.431 --> 27:23.223
just like you.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.517
So you won't mind
if l say a few words, then.

27:25.644 --> 27:28.228
- Well, the class
is $475 this month.

27:28.355 --> 27:29.772
[door opens]

27:29.898 --> 27:31.690
Yeah, you can pay weekly.
That's fine.

27:31.816 --> 27:34.860
You know, monthly
saves you $30 per class, though.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.862
Exactly.
Okay.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.614
Hey, l saw your new headshots,
by the way.

27:38.740 --> 27:39.865
Those are great.

27:39.991 --> 27:42.076
Those are fantastic.
Yeah.

27:42.202 --> 27:43.452
l love the one
with the motorcycle.

27:43.578 --> 27:44.912
l think it's great.

27:45.038 --> 27:46.830
Listen, l have to go.
l have some people here.

27:46.956 --> 27:49.208
Okay, so long.

27:49.334 --> 27:50.918
Listen,
just take the acting class.

27:51.044 --> 27:52.419
lt'll be really good for you.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.546
- No, l told you,
l'm not an actress.

27:54.673 --> 27:55.839
- lt's okay.

27:55.965 --> 27:58.050
That just means
you have more to reveal.

27:58.176 --> 28:01.178
Don't you think she should
take the acting class?

28:01.304 --> 28:03.013
- How long have you been here?

28:03.139 --> 28:06.183
- Um-l have-
Did you have something at 6:00?

28:06.309 --> 28:07.935
- Yeah, sorry, God.

28:08.061 --> 28:11.355
So thanks so much, and bye.

28:11.481 --> 28:15.067
- l'll call you.
- Okay.

28:15.193 --> 28:16.985
- Uh, l've been here
about three months.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.946
- Well, then l'm safe
in assuming you're familiar

28:19.072 --> 28:21.448
with our policy on recruiting
girls who look like that.

28:21.574 --> 28:23.200
- There's a policy?

28:23.326 --> 28:25.202
- You know how long
this operation's been running?

28:25.328 --> 28:26.662
Ten years,

28:26.788 --> 28:28.330
with only three name changes
and one move.

28:28.456 --> 28:30.040
Unlike others like it
who are forced to move

28:30.166 --> 28:31.500
from state to state,
from city to city

28:31.626 --> 28:33.711
like the penny ante cons
they truly are.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.213
And you know why?

28:36.339 --> 28:39.550
Because things here
are kept low-key.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.552
You take a girl like that girl
you just had in here,

28:41.678 --> 28:43.554
she's been told she's a looker

28:43.680 --> 28:46.098
since the day she was able to
smear on her mommy's lipstick.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.225
Guys have been falling over her
all her life,

28:48.351 --> 28:50.561
uncles staring at her
and jerking off

28:50.687 --> 28:53.272
under their pants
at family picnics.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.732
She believes she deserves

28:54.858 --> 28:56.525
to have the moon handed to her
on a string.

28:56.651 --> 28:59.236
You promise her that moon
and don't give it to her,

28:59.362 --> 29:02.823
or worse, she finds out
it wasn't there to begin with,

29:02.949 --> 29:05.242
firstly, it's cruel.

29:05.368 --> 29:07.661
And secondly,
she's gonna kick and scream

29:07.787 --> 29:10.456
like a spoiled brat until Daddy,
or in this case,

29:10.582 --> 29:12.791
the BBB, comes in
and makes it their business

29:12.917 --> 29:15.377
to shut us down
just to shut her up.

29:15.503 --> 29:19.006
You take another girl,
like that girl,

29:19.132 --> 29:21.967
who's had to work all her life
for everything she has,

29:22.093 --> 29:23.802
give her the chance
to believe she can cash in

29:23.928 --> 29:25.679
on her looks,
even in the most modest way,

29:25.805 --> 29:27.306
it doesn't work out for her,

29:27.432 --> 29:29.183
she's not gonna believe
the world came to an end;

29:29.309 --> 29:30.934
just the opposite.

29:31.060 --> 29:32.936
She's gonna figure she gave it
a shot and lets it go,

29:33.062 --> 29:35.022
because she kept
her expectations low all along,

29:35.148 --> 29:40.527
and we just helped her
keep them that way.

29:40.653 --> 29:43.030
- Okay.

29:43.156 --> 29:46.366
Firstly, that girl
that you're so worked up about,

29:46.493 --> 29:48.452
l didn't go fishing
for her, okay?

29:48.578 --> 29:50.537
She came to me, and l wasn't
about to chase her off.

29:50.663 --> 29:52.372
And you know what?
We're actually friends now.

29:52.499 --> 29:53.916
We're like Sunday buddies.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.459
So you don't
have to worry about her.

29:55.585 --> 29:57.920
Secondly, a couple of girls
that l brought in

29:58.046 --> 30:01.298
actually booked some jobs
off of some calls l made.

30:01.424 --> 30:03.342
So now if some girl gets mad

30:03.468 --> 30:05.052
because she isn't
being sent out,

30:05.178 --> 30:06.804
we can just
point to the ones who are,

30:06.930 --> 30:08.680
and we can say, "Hey,
it's a crap shoot out there.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.182
You just didn't have the stuff."

30:10.308 --> 30:12.726
So l'm actually
protecting the operation.

30:12.852 --> 30:14.978
And you know, if you get enough
girls working around here,

30:15.104 --> 30:17.523
this place might be,
like, a real agency.

30:17.649 --> 30:18.941
- Some speech.

30:19.067 --> 30:20.734
lf that's
what you're looking for,

30:20.860 --> 30:22.778
why didn't you join a real
agency in the first place?

30:22.904 --> 30:24.947
- 'Cause l don't want to start
in some horrible mail room

30:25.073 --> 30:26.406
and gradually slave my way up

30:26.533 --> 30:28.075
so that by the time
l'm old and bored,

30:28.201 --> 30:30.035
l might have a stake
in some stale company.

30:30.161 --> 30:35.165
- Did you express
these sentiments to. . .

30:35.291 --> 30:36.583
- l heard you were gonna teach

30:36.709 --> 30:38.126
one of these acting classes
yourself.

30:38.253 --> 30:40.420
You mind if l drop in,
pick up a few pointers?

30:40.547 --> 30:41.922
- Suit yourself.

30:42.048 --> 30:43.423
- Okay.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.217
l heard your spiel out there,
by the way,

30:45.343 --> 30:48.720
and if anything's unnecessarily
cruel, that was it.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.305
- Excuse me?

30:50.431 --> 30:52.766
- That whole line
about keeping expectations low,

30:52.892 --> 30:55.310
keeping things realistic,
that's horrible.

30:55.436 --> 30:57.229
l mean, if l promise a girl
the moon,

30:57.355 --> 30:59.022
then at least for a while,
she's high

30:59.148 --> 31:01.400
on the possibility she
may actually get it someday.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.402
And if she feels
fucked over afterwards,

31:03.528 --> 31:05.737
you know, she can tell herself
it was temporary madness,

31:05.864 --> 31:08.073
that she allowed
her basest desires

31:08.199 --> 31:10.909
to get hold of her for a moment
and now she's back on track.

31:11.035 --> 31:13.745
But you're hitting her
right where she lives.

31:13.872 --> 31:17.249
That is the most honest, decent,
practical part of her soul.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.293

she's been fucked over there,

59:16.427 --> 59:17.928
See, l resent it
every time l feel guilty,

59:18.054 --> 59:19.638

something that Jews feel.

young agents working at the bigs

01:00:21.367 --> 01:00:22.701

01:00:22.827 --> 01:00:24.202

01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:39.080

reason to marry someone.

- lsn't it?

01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:43.209
He needed to prove
that he would never leave me,
