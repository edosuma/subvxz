-Thank you so much.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.040
Exciting stuff.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.560
Now, this is...

01:44.600 --> 01:47.320
this is a bit of
a Ford-based show.

01:47.360 --> 01:50.720
Because we were staggered
to hear the other day,

01:50.760 --> 01:53.040
that they're thinking of
pulling the plug

01:53.080 --> 01:54.760
on the Mondeo.

01:54.800 --> 01:58.040
Now this is enormous news.

01:58.080 --> 02:01.120
In Britain, losing the Mondeo
is a bit like...

02:01.160 --> 02:03.760
Well,
losing the Royal Family.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.520
And if that happens, someone
would make a documentary
about them.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.840
Quite. Which is why
we decided this week

02:08.880 --> 02:11.040
The Grand Tour
should make a documentary

02:11.080 --> 02:17.040
about the passing of Ford's
medium-sized family saloon.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.080
-It's exciting stuff.
-(LAUGHTER)

02:23.840 --> 02:26.840
The Mondeo story
actually begins way back

02:26.880 --> 02:28.880
when the world
was black and white,

02:28.880 --> 02:31.000
with this -

02:31.040 --> 02:32.960
the Ford Cortina.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.680
This is Genesis,
the first chapter

02:37.720 --> 02:40.880
in easily
the most important book

02:40.960 --> 02:43.040
in British motoring history.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.840
It came along in 1962

02:47.880 --> 02:50.760
and apart from
the CND rear lights,

02:50.800 --> 02:52.720
it was nothing special.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.840
It wasn't revolutionary
like the Mini.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.560
It was just
an ordinary family saloon.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.360
Ford therefore decided
that to put it on the map

03:05.400 --> 03:08.160
they'd mount an assault
on the world's racetracks.

03:08.200 --> 03:11.680
Which meant creating
a high-performance version.

03:11.720 --> 03:15.160
The world's first ever
fast Ford.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.880
And this is what
they came up with.

It had a revolutionary
twin-cam 1.6 litre engine.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.760
It revved like hell.

04:03.800 --> 04:07.080
All the way to 8,000 RPM.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.520
And produced 105 horsepower.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.760
Ha-ha, ha-ha!

04:15.800 --> 04:17.880
Oh, wow!

04:20.960 --> 04:24.640
The result was some
spectacular performance.

04:24.680 --> 04:28.240
The road cars
would do 108 mph.

04:28.320 --> 04:32.480
And in race trim
that shot up to 145.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.800
That was the stuff of
spaceships back then.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.040
And best of all...

04:40.080 --> 04:41.920
if you were really on it,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.720
it would lift the front wheel
in the corners.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.080
(TYRES SCREECH)

04:48.120 --> 04:51.920
On the downside
it didn't stop properly...

04:52.000 --> 04:53.920
...and there was
very little grip.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.200
So it was
an over-steer mentalist.

04:59.920 --> 05:03.600
It was also
astonishingly brittle.

05:03.640 --> 05:06.440
Autocar magazine
ran one for a year.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.880
29,000 miles.

05:07.920 --> 05:11.360
And in that time,
it needed six rear axles

05:11.360 --> 05:14.080
and three sets
of rear suspension.

05:14.120 --> 05:17.000
And probably a whole load of
new half-shafts as well,

05:17.040 --> 05:18.800
because they were made
from chocolate.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.480
But it didn't matter.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.480
Because the Lotus Cortina
wasn't designed to
last a lifetime.

05:24.520 --> 05:28.080
It was designed
to last about 40 minutes.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.520
Because that is
how long a race lasted.

05:33.560 --> 05:37.040
Back in the early '60s,
saloon-car racing in Britain

05:37.080 --> 05:40.080
was just about the most
exciting motor sport

05:40.120 --> 05:43.240
the world had ever seen.

05:43.280 --> 05:46.400
The massive American Fords
would roar down the straights

05:46.440 --> 05:49.000
and then in the corners
the army of Minis

05:49.040 --> 05:50.760
would be right back at them.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.760
It was beautiful,
snarling chaos.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.800
(CRASHING)

05:56.840 --> 05:59.960
But when the dust settled,
it was the Lotus Cortina

that was doing the winning.

-It actually won the

06:06.760 --> 06:10.000
...and it didn't only shine
on the tracks.

In 1966, it won the RAC
Rally of Britain.

06:15.400 --> 06:19.160
They even drove one
down the bobsleigh run
in the Italian resort

06:19.200 --> 06:23.640
after which the Cortina
had been named.

of the moment perfectly.

It was exciting.

06:52.280 --> 06:55.000
the ordinary family man

Like he wasn't just
a downtrodden cog.

with the Mark II Cortina.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.360
The result was spectacular.

07:07.400 --> 07:11.560
One car in every three
sold in the UK was a Ford.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.080
And one in ten was a Cortina.

Everyone I've spoken to while
I've been preparing this film

"Oh, yeah, my dad
used to have one of those."

whose dad had a Cortina?

07:23.960 --> 07:25.640
Ha! Look at that.
It's everyone.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.240
Apart from the director,
obviously, who has a
double-barrelled name,

07:29.280 --> 07:31.400
so his dad had a Range Rover.
But anyway...

07:31.440 --> 07:34.280
the point is, these were
the best-selling cars

07:34.320 --> 07:37.400

by miles.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.480

rampant sexism

that Ford used to make
a name for its family saloon.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.280
There was some important
business stuff too.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.720
(TICKING)

07:52.760 --> 07:57.520
Back in late-1960s Britain,
if you earned £3,000 a year

07:57.560 --> 08:01.760
the government would take
41% of it away in tax.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.000
So, to get round this
problem, a lot of companies

08:04.040 --> 08:05.760
paid their staff a bit less,

08:05.800 --> 08:07.240
but then to make up
the difference

08:07.280 --> 08:09.720
they gave them...a car.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.680
And that...

08:11.720 --> 08:13.760
wasn't subject
to any tax at all.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.200
JEREMY:
Ford cottoned on to that.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.800
And came up with
a variety of trim levels

08:20.840 --> 08:23.520
to suit the typical
management structure.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.600
There was a base model
for the sales rep.

08:28.920 --> 08:32.960
And the L
for the sales manager.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.960
Then you had the XL
with a clock and a
locking glove compartment

08:37.000 --> 08:40.280
for the sales director.

08:40.320 --> 08:46.160
And the powerful GT
for the managing director.

08:46.200 --> 08:51.880
Ford's badging policy quite
literally changed the class
system in Britain.

08:51.880 --> 08:55.280
Because we used to judge
people on how they held
their knife and fork,

08:55.320 --> 08:57.240
or whether they said
toilet or lavatory.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.280
But after
the Cortina came along,

08:59.320 --> 09:02.760
it was all based on what
it said on your boot lid.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.960
Our dads understood
what these badges meant.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.400
coming out of that door
one afternoon in 1969,

09:25.440 --> 09:30.880
skipping along here, coming
round this gatepost here,

09:30.960 --> 09:33.760
and I noticed
that parked over there

09:33.760 --> 09:37.160
was a 1600E - an E -
in amber gold.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.320

The E was the absolute
king of the hill.

09:50.840 --> 09:54.520
It had four dials
set into its wooden dash.

09:54.600 --> 09:58.600
It had a leather and
aluminium steering wheel.

And on the outside
there were Rostyle wheels

10:00.840 --> 10:04.040
and front fog lamps.

the enormity of the hug
I gave my dad,

cos I was just
so proud of him.

10:39.720 --> 10:44.320

An E stood for Executive.

10:44.360 --> 10:48.720

another young boy
called James May

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
went through
the exact same thing.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.200
I was at my mate
Andrew Jones's house,
just up the road from ours,

11:09.240 --> 11:12.080
when his dad came in
and said that my dad

11:12.120 --> 11:15.680
had just arrived home
and he had a new car.

11:15.720 --> 11:18.120
So, I went outside...

11:18.160 --> 11:21.200
and there
parked next to the kerb,

11:21.240 --> 11:24.480
was a brand-new Cortina GXL.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.600
And I thought, "Well, that
can't be my dad's new car."

11:29.480 --> 11:30.800
But it was.

11:33.840 --> 11:37.760
This was the all-new
Mark III Cortina.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.520
And, because it was
the GXL model,

11:40.560 --> 11:43.040
it had chrome strips
on the grille,

11:43.080 --> 11:45.000
and a vinyl roof.

11:45.040 --> 11:49.000
And four auxiliary dials
that were angled
towards the driver.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.120
It also had something
called a rev counter,

11:53.160 --> 11:55.400
and I'd never seen
one of those before.

11:55.440 --> 11:58.000

as James and me.

his dad only had an XL.

That wasn't cos
I wanted the exercise.

walk or hop or crawl 30 miles

getting into that.

I could have mattered.
But you came into my life...

14:32.200 --> 14:35.400
My dad bought
a Mark III Cortina

14:35.440 --> 14:37.120
because he had three children

14:37.160 --> 14:38.840
and he wanted them
to be safe.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.240
And he knew
they would be safe,

made a film telling him so.

and just pretend to drive it,
which was brilliant.

the back of the other joined.

-It was absolutely hopeless.
-Were they the same colour?

22:03.720 --> 22:07.160
Well, when I bought them,
broadly similar,
yes, they were.

Look, this is,
it's not really

22:09.840 --> 22:11.280
-No.
-It's more Memory Lane.

Anyway, we now have
to get back to the Cortina.

22:13.960 --> 22:17.680
Yes, we do, because when
it was killed off in 1982,

22:17.720 --> 22:21.080

on the idea of a

22:23.040 --> 22:25.080
they came up
with a replacement.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.120
It was called the Sierra.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.600
Here is a picture of it.
And, to begin with,

22:29.640 --> 22:31.920
-it was a bit of a lemon,
wasn't it?
-It was.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.680
When it came out,
everybody said they hated

22:33.720 --> 22:36.680
its kind of futuristic,
aerodynamic shape.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.880
They said it looked horrid,
like a jelly mould.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.840
And then everybody worked out

22:40.880 --> 22:43.360
the aerodynamics
didn't even work.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.480
No, it turned out in a
straight line it was fine,

22:45.520 --> 22:46.960
but when it got hit
by a crosswind,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.240
or would overtake a truck
on the motorway,

22:49.280 --> 22:50.960
it would veer about
like a drunk.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.320
Yeah, another problem
was the motor trade hated it

22:54.360 --> 22:57.240
because that plastic front
end, if you had a crash,

22:57.280 --> 22:59.680
it would boing back into
shape, which was brilliant.

22:59.720 --> 23:04.760
But you didn't know that
everything behind it was
actually smashed to pieces.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.920
Now, Ford decided
there was only one way

23:06.960 --> 23:10.520
to get everybody to

came up with was this...

23:21.200 --> 23:23.920
...the Sierra RS Cosworth.

A car that could do
150 miles an hour.

It was 1986. Lots of cars
could do 150, but not a Ford.

That was madness.
BMW and Mercedes
could not believe it.

This was the gardener coming
into the parlour and kicking
the baron's teeth out.

The blue-bloods were being
absolutely battered by this -

24:10.200 --> 24:12.640
The Sierra's muscle
came from Cosworth.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.320
The British engine builder

24:15.360 --> 24:17.760
whose most famous
Formula One V8

24:17.800 --> 24:22.360
had taken a staggering
176 Grand Prix victories.

24:24.360 --> 24:27.680
They took a drab,
cast-iron saloon car engine

24:27.720 --> 24:30.320
and fitted it with an
aluminium twin-cam head,

24:30.360 --> 24:33.280
a turbo
the size of a dustbin,

24:33.320 --> 24:36.360
and turned it
into a masterpiece.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.840
It was built to be
a hard-working unit, this.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.560
As you can tell.

24:44.600 --> 24:47.480
The interesting thing
about this engine,
is if you look carefully

24:47.520 --> 24:49.480
you can see there's
a second set of injectors

24:49.520 --> 24:51.880
that weren't actually
connected to anything.

24:51.920 --> 24:55.520
They were installed because
Ford knew they'd be necessary

24:55.560 --> 24:59.080
when they did
what they always did
with their family cars...

24:59.120 --> 25:01.040
go racing with them.

25:03.440 --> 25:07.280
With those injectors engaged,
and bigger turbos fitted,

25:07.320 --> 25:13.680
the race cars were churning
out a massive 525 horsepower.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.920
They were unstoppable.

The Ford Sierra Cosworth,

25:19.960 --> 25:23.320
the top touring car
of the day.

the Sierra won 84%

25:26.200 --> 25:28.080
of races it entered.

25:28.120 --> 25:31.320
84%.

25:31.360 --> 25:35.120
And that makes it
the most successful
racing car ever made.

raced one and didn't win.

famous feature...

26:08.600 --> 26:10.920
...that massive back wing.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.400
And that wing says everything
about the Cosworth.

26:13.440 --> 26:16.720
Compared with grown-up things
from Mercedes and BMW,

26:16.760 --> 26:18.560

to men called Gav

26:30.200 --> 26:32.120
in every flat-roof pub

26:32.160 --> 26:34.320

could drive upside-down

26:34.360 --> 26:36.280

Cosworth turned the Sierra
into one of the most
desirable cars on the planet.

it only cost 17 grand,

who reported being followed
by criminals,

so they could nick it.

the pleasure of owning it,
if I'm honest.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.960
Ford got so desperate,

29:15.000 --> 29:18.400
they dropped the price
of the Cosworth by £7,000 -

29:18.440 --> 29:21.000
the value of
an entire Fiesta -

29:21.040 --> 29:23.040

for me there

power, about 200 horsepower.

to show is,

in suspension and tyres,

33:31.240 --> 33:34.440

making the Sierra

to export the idea

for everyone here,

that no car in history
has ever managed.

-There's this.
-There's this.

35:43.160 --> 35:45.520
RICHARD: What about
the Subaru Legacy Outback?

35:45.560 --> 35:47.160
But the front diff's rubbish.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.640
You can't go round a corner
when you're going slowly.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.760
-So it's a bit annoying.
-So it is just this?

35:51.800 --> 35:54.840
JEREMY: Yeah.
JAMES: This is it.

35:54.880 --> 35:58.600
Do you know what I liked?
It's the fast version,
but it was still comfortable.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.960
These seats were great.
It still rides properly.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.560
It doesn't make a terrible
racket, it's just civilised.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.640
RICHARD: I like the way
it was a practical estate.

36:05.680 --> 36:09.040
It had a massive boot,
and Ford had the sense
to give it five doors.

36:09.080 --> 36:11.760
Which is something
Austin didn't think of
with the Allegro.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.760
No, that is true.
I like the speed.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.160
Oh, there's a surprise.

36:15.160 --> 36:17.120
(ENGINE REVVING)

0-60, seven seconds.
Top speed, 150.

36:26.160 --> 36:29.120
It didn't look it, but this
was as quick as a Cosworth.

36:32.560 --> 36:36.800
And when they turned it
into the ST220 in 2002,

36:36.840 --> 36:40.040
it looked right as well.

36:40.080 --> 36:42.480
They should have sold these
by the million.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.320
But there was a problem.

36:45.360 --> 36:46.680
(SOUNDTRACK STOPS ABRUPTLY)

36:49.120 --> 36:51.480
This.

36:51.520 --> 36:57.360
The first so-called MPV,
the Toyota Picnic.

36:57.400 --> 37:00.480
In 1996 when it was first
introduced, we laughed at it,

37:00.520 --> 37:03.320
because it seemed so stupid.

37:05.880 --> 37:09.960
I mean, why name a car
after something you
might do in it? Picnic.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.280
No, they didn't have
a Toyota Dentist, did they?

37:12.320 --> 37:15.880

It's just an ordinary act,
it's not even exciting.

37:15.920 --> 37:17.640

37:17.680 --> 37:19.320
-(CHUCKLING)
-It's just a stupid idea.

37:19.360 --> 37:20.960
A naff thing to do.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.120
It cost the same as a Mondeo,
it was just a bit taller.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.560
Yeah. It's in case your head
suddenly grows tall.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.120
Was there a fashion
for wearing

37:29.160 --> 37:31.640
Victorian industrialist hats
at the time?

37:31.640 --> 37:34.280
-No, there wasn't.
-Well, there's no excuse
for it, then.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.160
Unless you've actually
got a Busby

37:36.160 --> 37:39.040

of your head...

37:39.080 --> 37:40.800
RICHARD:
There is no other reason.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.960
And what troubles me,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.600
is think of the damage
this did to children.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.680
"Come out and see
the new car, kids!"

37:47.760 --> 37:50.400

JAMES: It actually says,
"Family fun vehicle" on it.

38:05.160 --> 38:07.040
JEREMY: It doesn't?
What's fun about it?

38:07.080 --> 38:08.960
RICHARD: It isn't more fun.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.360
We thought,
when it first came along,
that it would be a fad,

38:12.400 --> 38:15.400
like culottes,
or deep fried brie,

38:15.440 --> 38:17.320
or Crocs, or tattoos.

38:17.360 --> 38:20.040
Something where you think,
"Oh, that's fun,"

38:20.080 --> 38:23.800
and then realise
five minutes later that
it's actually ridiculous.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.280
But, no.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.880
This idiotic tall car idea

38:28.920 --> 38:31.000
actually started to catch on.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.840
Renault came up
with their version,

38:35.880 --> 38:37.880
which was called
the Scenic.

38:37.920 --> 38:40.680
And pretty soon,
everyone was at it -

38:40.760 --> 38:43.960
Mazda, Fiat,
Vauxhall, the lot!

38:46.040 --> 38:48.600
RICHARD: Think what
you started, you bastard.

38:48.640 --> 38:50.840
You deserve this,
and you're having it.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.760
And you're having more of it.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.680
A new car is a great thing,
but not when it's you!

38:57.760 --> 38:59.640
Oh, you've got a mirror left.

39:01.200 --> 39:04.000

you ruined.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.880
You are the Allegro Estate
of modern times,

39:06.920 --> 39:09.440
and you deserve this.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.960
To make matters worse
for Ford,

39:12.000 --> 39:15.120
in 2000, the British
Government decided
that company cars

39:15.160 --> 39:17.280
should be taxed,
like income.

39:17.320 --> 39:19.640
Yeah, that meant people
had to buy their own cars.

39:19.640 --> 39:22.880
And many responded
by not buying a car at all.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.760
As interest rates
were so low,

39:26.800 --> 39:29.520
it made more sense
to lease.

39:29.560 --> 39:32.000
And if you're gonna do that,
why not get a BMW?

39:33.480 --> 39:36.120
Or a Mercedes?

39:36.160 --> 39:38.520
As the rot
started to take hold,

39:38.560 --> 39:42.440
Ford reverted to type
and got serious
about motor racing.

39:49.840 --> 39:53.760
In 2000, they came first,
second and third

39:53.800 --> 39:56.160
in the British Touring Car
Championship.

39:56.200 --> 40:00.280
COMMENTATOR: All three Fords
were on the front row again
for the sprint race...

40:00.320 --> 40:04.400

And the following year,
Mondeo sales did go up a bit.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.400
COMMENTATOR:
Ford drivers clocking ...

40:06.440 --> 40:10.880
JEREMY: But then,
they stopped motor racing.

40:10.920 --> 40:15.200
And the MPVs kept coming,
and leasing a Mercedes
got cheaper,

40:15.280 --> 40:19.000
and the effect on Ford
was astonishing.

40:20.760 --> 40:26.120
In 1994, they sold
127,000 Mondeos in Britain.

40:26.160 --> 40:30.160
In 2017,
that was down to 12,000.

40:32.160 --> 40:36.280
And 85% of those
12,000 were fleet sales,

40:36.320 --> 40:38.320
hire car companies
and the police.

40:38.360 --> 40:41.560
And that means only
1900 Mondeos

40:41.600 --> 40:43.520
were sold to private buyers.

40:43.560 --> 40:47.200
-Yeah, people that actually
went and bought one.
-Yeah, 1900.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.040
And, if you think about it,

40:49.080 --> 40:51.280
Ford has 500 dealers
in Britain, yeah?

40:51.320 --> 40:54.600
-Yeah.
-Each of those will have
taken two Mondeos a year?

40:54.640 --> 40:57.400
Oh, God, yeah,
as demonstrators.
Yes, they would have done.

40:57.440 --> 40:59.920
-So really, we are...
-900, you're talking about.

40:59.960 --> 41:03.040
900 people actually said,
"I'll buy one of those
with my money."

41:03.080 --> 41:06.120
Yeah, 900 people.

41:06.160 --> 41:10.080
When they used to sell
127,000 of them a year.

41:10.120 --> 41:12.200
-That's an astonishing fact.
-I know.

41:16.480 --> 41:21.160
In America, things are so bad
the Mondeo will be pulled
from the showrooms this year.

41:32.440 --> 41:35.160
And it's predicted
that soon after that,

41:35.200 --> 41:37.560
it'll go from the rest
of the world as well.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.600
And when that happens,

41:42.640 --> 41:45.960
Britain will have lost
much more than just a car.

41:47.960 --> 41:51.160
The Mondeo was never fancy
or spectacular,

41:51.160 --> 41:55.000
it never won Le Mans, it was
never awarded a Nobel Prize,

41:55.040 --> 41:56.960
it didn't write
The Grapes Of Wrath.

41:58.040 --> 41:59.680
It was just your mate,

41:59.760 --> 42:03.040

going to the pub with.

42:07.520 --> 42:08.960

42:09.000 --> 42:12.400

or spectacular like, say,

42:12.440 --> 42:16.360
Mick Jagger dies,
it'll be sad.

that is heart-breaking.

-100 would be nice,
wouldn't it?
-Yeah.

rather more than 100.

So we'll carry on a bit,
yeah?

54:18.520 --> 54:21.320
Yeah, we'll stick around.
The thing is, as I said,

54:21.360 --> 54:24.400
the show as you know it
is ending, and that's very
upsetting for us.

I haven't insulted.

it's not goodbye from us,
