WEBVTT

00:14.180 --> 00:16.057
[Alexa] Katie and I were so excited.

00:16.141 --> 00:19.602
In two days, we were going
to our first high school dance.

00:19.686 --> 00:23.815
But this also meant we were ending
the semester just how we started it.

00:23.898 --> 00:26.109
What are we gonna do with our hair?

00:26.776 --> 00:28.194
It's so cute just like that.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.238
And it's coming in so fast.

00:30.321 --> 00:33.491
It's not long enough to show off,
so maybe next year's Winter Formal.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.453
You know, I hate
that I can't go all out on my Willy Wonka

00:36.536 --> 00:37.871
without my wig flying off.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.122
[Katie hums tune]

00:41.916 --> 00:42.917
See?

00:43.001 --> 00:44.544
And that is my go-to move.

00:45.253 --> 00:47.714
So, what time is Dylan picking us up
on Saturday?

00:47.797 --> 00:51.092
-I'll ask him.
-Because with hair, face, nails...

00:51.176 --> 00:52.761
I need three hours, six minutes.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.930
You can't rush this.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.309
-[cell phone chimes]
-Oh, six o'clock.

00:59.851 --> 01:02.228
But he wishes it was sooner.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.189
Aw!

01:04.272 --> 01:07.650
Katie, did you know Melissa Fink
asked Ryan to the dance?

01:08.234 --> 01:09.736
Oh, she did?

01:09.819 --> 01:11.696
But she couldn't go
because she got the flu.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.491
Oh, she did?

01:15.658 --> 01:20.163
Wait. Wait. Alexa, if the flu's
going around um... can you go?

01:20.246 --> 01:21.414
It's just one person.

01:21.498 --> 01:25.335
And Melissa always says she's sick.
Remember when she said her appendix burst?

01:26.336 --> 01:27.420
Yeah, it did.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.339
Whatever. I'm still going to that dance.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.467
Come on, Katie. What about you and Ryan?

01:32.550 --> 01:34.344
I'll see him at the dance.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.763
I'm just excited
that we're all going together.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.682
Can I get a celebration Wonka?

01:39.766 --> 01:41.768
[funk music playing]

01:44.771 --> 01:46.022

This is so sweet of you!

02:41.202 --> 02:42.370
Know why I did it?

02:42.453 --> 02:44.873
-Because you love me.
-I want a puppy.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.542
Oh, buddy, you know--

02:47.625 --> 02:49.377
I know you're super busy,

02:49.460 --> 02:52.422
so I thought if I helped out,
I could have a puppy.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.884
I'm sorry. It's just too much right now.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.386
How about in a couple of years
when I'm done with school?

02:59.220 --> 03:01.598
But I am impressed.

03:02.181 --> 03:03.391
Oh, my God!

03:05.435 --> 03:06.477
Jack!

03:07.145 --> 03:09.564
All this for one bagel?

03:14.152 --> 03:15.904
Please? I'm great with pets.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.240
Secret Kitty loved me,
and I've taken really good care of Tobias.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.783
-Who?
-My lizard.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.076
We have a lizard?

03:22.994 --> 03:24.662
Yeah. He's around here somewhere.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.625
Honey, it's very, very sweet,
what you did.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.836
But now I have to clean up this mess.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.962
I can help.

03:39.928 --> 03:40.929
Oops.

03:42.430 --> 03:43.348
Thank you.

03:43.431 --> 03:45.308

Tobias?

03:58.655 --> 04:00.907
We just had the best Spanish class ever.

04:00.990 --> 04:04.744
Senyora Tompkins has the flu, so we got
to talk about the dance the whole time.

04:04.827 --> 04:05.870
It was excelente!

04:05.954 --> 04:07.580
That means "excellent."

04:09.165 --> 04:10.166
The flu again?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.502
And she went home
so no one else would get it.

04:12.585 --> 04:13.878
Muy thoughtful of her.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.338
Muy means "very."

04:15.421 --> 04:17.090
It's also a cute name for a cow.

04:20.218 --> 04:23.012
Katie, you should ask Ryan to the dance.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.598
It will be fun! And we'll both have dates.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.892
Hm. Maybe I should.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.144
I-I'll text him.

04:30.645 --> 04:31.688
He's right there!

04:31.771 --> 04:34.691
What happened to going big
with a grand, romantic gesture?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.359
That's for other people.

04:36.442 --> 04:40.196
Yeah, I am more of a go-big coach.

Katie's asking Ryan to the dance.

So it is true!

I'm so excited!

-Hi. So, Ryan--
-Yes.

-Yes?
-Yes.

Great! Uh...

05:24.949 --> 05:27.952
Just... Just so we're clear,
I was going to ask you to the dance.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.245
Yeah, the answer's yes.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.081
I hope you know how to Wonka.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.583
Yeah, I do.

Formal, when I won with the theme...

about Formal tonight.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.670
Which tie should I wear?
The bow tie or necktie?

07:01.170 --> 07:04.715
-You could have texted me.
-Yeah... but then I wouldn't be here.

07:06.384 --> 07:07.677
Aw!

Check.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.334
There is a flu outbreak.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.837
This is what I was afraid of! This means--

07:42.920 --> 07:44.547
It means nothing. I'm still going.

07:45.047 --> 07:47.425
But you can't risk being exposed
with your immune system.

07:47.508 --> 07:48.759
I'm going, OK?

07:48.843 --> 07:51.262
I couldn't try out for basketball,
I couldn't do the play.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.556
I'm not gonna miss
my first high school dance.

But your parents will never let you go.

Well, they will if they never find out.

08:01.606 --> 08:04.317
Delete the email from our parents' phones
before they see it.

-Nice.
-You distract, I'll delete.

-Hey, Dad, can I borrow your phone?

08:23.836 --> 08:24.879
Oh, OK.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.967
Yeah, I was overthinking it. I'm good.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.970
Uh... So, not the colorful ones?

08:33.054 --> 08:35.640
Oh, really? Yeah, I know, but...

08:35.723 --> 08:37.433
The white ones are classy,

08:37.517 --> 08:40.186
but my old colorful ones are so cheery.

08:40.811 --> 08:41.729
Cheery.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.105
-[button clicks]
-Classy.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.607
I just don't know!

08:46.150 --> 08:47.360
Thanks, Dad.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.696
-One down.
-[groans] I did not like that.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.490
Well, then you're gonna hate the next two.

"The most wonderful time
of the year." Yeah, right!

09:01.082 --> 09:02.959
-OK, you distract her.
-No!

09:03.042 --> 09:07.588
Hey, Jennifer, Katie has a question for
you about that one thing. Right, Katie?

09:07.672 --> 09:09.090
[Katie] Yeah. Yeah.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.259
I was just wondering...

09:11.342 --> 09:12.760
how is school going?

09:12.843 --> 09:14.470
Did they email your grades yet?

09:15.846 --> 09:18.349
-Oh. Well, let me check my phone.
-Oh, gosh.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.895
I don't care what your grades are.
I am just so darn proud of you!

So darn proud!

09:30.945 --> 09:31.946
All right, see ya.

09:35.825 --> 09:36.951
That was odd.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.162
Nice, but odd.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.834
-Oh, there's her phone.
-OK.

Would you look at that?

[Lori groans]

09:58.598 --> 09:59.890
All right, honey...

10:00.850 --> 10:03.019
-Would you uh hold the ladder for me?
-Yeah.

10:03.769 --> 10:04.770
All right.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.982
OK. Uh... How is this?

10:08.065 --> 10:09.859
Uh... A little to the left.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.152
OK. How is that?

10:11.235 --> 10:12.570
Too much. Back to the right.

10:13.904 --> 10:16.949
-And that?
-Uh... No, too much. No, go back.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.535
OK. Now just kind of twist it a little.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.454
Just... OK. Back to the right.

10:23.247 --> 10:24.248
How's this?

10:26.375 --> 10:27.376
Perfect?

10:28.252 --> 10:30.087
Katie, what are you doing with my phone?

10:30.171 --> 10:31.922
[chuckles] She has no boundaries.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.799
Katie, we talked about this.

10:36.052 --> 10:39.555
I was deleting an email from school,
but I didn't want to.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.892
-There's a flu outbreak.
-What?

10:42.975 --> 10:43.809
Katie!

10:43.893 --> 10:47.355
I'm sorry, OK? I was hoping
we'd get caught two parents ago.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.233
I don't want you to risk your health.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.028
B-But I can still go, right, Mom?

10:54.111 --> 10:55.363
I'm totally healthy.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.531
Honey, and we have to keep it that way.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.158
I am so sorry.

10:59.241 --> 11:02.536
This breaks my heart,
but you can't go.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.913
You know that.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.083
Yeah.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.001
Yeah.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.862
Didn't ask what you got,
just if you got them.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.989
But uh... congratulations.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.450

Must be nice.

-Yeah, it's a dry-clean-only towel.

Hey, who needs Winter Formal?

Want to see me juggle?

Uh... We're not in the mood, Lucas.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.890
Oh, good, because I cannot juggle.

I'm sorry.

I know you guys are just trying
to cheer me up, but it's no use.

control my life, it does.

-Alexa...
-Just please go to the dance.

I'd feel even worse if you missed it, too.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.200
OK, if you're sure.

I mean, if I were you, I'd want you to go.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.038
Wait. I'd want me...

13:09.538 --> 13:11.624
OK, if I were me... I love you.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.922
Katie, you're going, too.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.132
You can't cancel on Ryan,

13:20.216 --> 13:22.384
like I have to cancel on Dylan.

13:24.011 --> 13:26.931
I know I have to tell him,
but I really don't want to.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.975
Hey, I can call him for you.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.770
You can talk to him later
when you're ready.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.522
Thanks, Katie.

13:35.189 --> 13:38.025
Now, I'm sorry,
but I really want to be alone.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.320
OK.

Really?

13:50.287 --> 13:51.247
Hey.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.624
-So, Katie left?
-Yeah.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.876
Yeah, I told her to go,

13:55.960 --> 13:57.169
and then she left!

13:58.212 --> 13:59.588
Well, I'll stay with you.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.633
Thanks, Mom,
but I really want to be alone.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.094
OK.

14:10.474 --> 14:11.475
Really?

14:15.646 --> 14:17.856

14:17.940 --> 14:19.275
Yeah, so do I.

14:19.358 --> 14:23.404
Poor kid. Stuck at home instead of going
to her first high school dance.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.949
Mm. So cute.

14:28.784 --> 14:32.204
Mom, look at my suit! I can't wear this!

14:32.288 --> 14:35.040
Lucas, I told you to try it on!

14:35.124 --> 14:36.750
Hey, we are where we are.

14:38.043 --> 14:41.297
OK, has this been at the bottom
of your closet since you last wore it?

14:41.380 --> 14:43.966
No. It was stuffed
in the back of my drawer.

14:45.426 --> 14:48.345
-What are we gonna do?
-You can borrow one of my suits.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.598
What are we gonna do?

14:52.600 --> 14:55.728
Well, luckily, this is a problem
I can actually fix. I will iron it.

-You know, I get a lot of compliments--
-Dad, please.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.858
I can't wear a dad suit.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.862
That was uncalled for.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.699
Yeah, I know, Dylan.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.409
I'm sad, too.

are the best thing I've ever tasted.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.221
You're a good friend.

But now Alexa
doesn't get to go to the dance.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.851
OK, everything is just so unfair for her.

the way we want it to, but...

anything is possible.

So...

So what I'm really saying is...

16:14.098 --> 16:15.140
never give up.

16:17.267 --> 16:20.020
You're going to find a way
to cheer up Alexa. You always do.

do happen around the holidays.

I dropped your pizza.

it drops cheese-side down, but tonight...
