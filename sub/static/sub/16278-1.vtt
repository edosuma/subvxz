men and women who loved
their country and their Creator.

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:48.336
400 years ago,

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:50.338
our forefathers left

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:52.341
the religious oppression
of another land

01:11:52.342 --> 01:11:54.258
to build this one.

01:11:54.259 --> 01:11:56.094
And the first thing they did...

01:11:56.095 --> 01:11:57.929
the first thing they did

01:11:57.930 --> 01:12:01.149
was to put a cross
on the shores of the Atlantic.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:04.068
But it was more than a cross.

01:12:04.069 --> 01:12:07.105
It was a symbol that,
in this land,

01:12:07.106 --> 01:12:09.407
a citizen has the freedom

01:12:09.408 --> 01:12:12.193
to worship as he or she desires

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:15.697
or the freedom
not to worship at all.

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:19.200
My fight
isn't about colored lights

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:21.703
or a tree on the city square.

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:23.621
My fight is about freedom

01:12:23.622 --> 01:12:27.125
and taking back
what has been stolen from us.

01:12:27.126 --> 01:12:29.627
We are losing freedoms
one by one

01:12:29.628 --> 01:12:32.880
that our forefathers,
our brothers in arms,

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:35.600
and my son died for.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:39.020
It is time we stood up
for what they died for,

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.806
for what we believe in.

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:46.060
Our rights are being destroyed
perhaps forever.

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:48.363
But don't you see?

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:52.116
We're <i>letting</i> it happen.

01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:54.986
We're asleep.

01:12:54.987 --> 01:12:57.406
We sleep, and they come in
like a thief in the night

01:12:57.407 --> 01:12:59.907
and they take what's left.

01:12:59.908 --> 01:13:01.409

Look what's coming
over the horizon!

01:13:10.335 --> 01:13:13.304
We can't let the enemy
take one more inch.

01:13:13.305 --> 01:13:15.807
Not one more inch!

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:19.677
We can't be silent any more!

01:13:19.678 --> 01:13:24.649
This silence has to stop,
and it has to stop today!

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:29.153
Young men and women
are dying in foreign lands

01:13:29.154 --> 01:13:34.158
to preserve the freedoms
that we enjoy every single day.

01:13:34.159 --> 01:13:36.160
Can you hear them?

01:13:36.161 --> 01:13:38.663
Just listen.

01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:41.165
It's their voices
from the grave.

01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:45.169
They're wondering
if they died in vain.

01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:50.124
Do we dare diminish
their sacrifice by our silence?

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:53.595
Well, if your answer is no,
then you think about this...

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:55.546
When history is written,

01:13:55.547 --> 01:14:00.635
will history say you stood by
and you did nothing?

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:03.019
Or will history say
that you fought?

01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.605
You fought
like those brave souls?

the memory

of the young men and women

for this country and for you?
