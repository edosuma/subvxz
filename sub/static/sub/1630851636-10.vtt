WEBVTT

00:03.937 --> 00:05.273
Previously on Bull...

00:05.406 --> 00:06.674
We could keep this up
for a while,

00:06.807 --> 00:08.076
but eventually it'll fall apart.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.511
It stops now.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.346
Taylor...
TAYLOR: Tidal.

00:12.480 --> 00:13.514
Soccer mom.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.749
You still up for an adventure?

00:15.849 --> 00:17.185
And you're in.

00:17.318 --> 00:18.852
Here's your cash.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.921
I'm considering leaving TAC
and going to work

00:21.021 --> 00:22.356
for Bradley Lena.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.492
You want your name
above the door?

00:24.625 --> 00:26.294
You never asked for that.

00:26.427 --> 00:27.995
With him, I didn't have to.
BULL: If you would like

00:28.129 --> 00:29.430
to change
the name of the company, I...
I want to be

00:29.530 --> 00:31.132
somewhere my value is known.
You ar...

00:31.265 --> 00:34.034
Not something that I have to
argue for or negotiate.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.037
Goodbye.

00:38.939 --> 00:41.275
MAN:
I don't know where
to start, Linda.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.844
We're building
a modern luxury hotel,

00:43.977 --> 00:45.679
not refurbishing
an ancient ruin.
(vacuum whirring)

00:45.813 --> 00:47.148
(muffled arguing)

00:48.282 --> 00:50.017
We are way too close
to deadline

00:50.151 --> 00:53.187
for you to be sending me
something this rough!

00:53.321 --> 00:54.855
Anyone else in the office
presented this,

00:54.988 --> 00:56.190
you'd be singing
their praises.

00:56.324 --> 00:57.491
That's crap,
and you know it.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.393
(arguing continues)
(rough whirring)

00:59.527 --> 01:00.694
Ah, shoot.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.230
LINDA:
Are you out of your damn mind?

01:04.565 --> 01:05.666
(man grunts)

01:05.799 --> 01:08.869
(thump)

01:09.002 --> 01:10.538
(Linda screams)

01:10.671 --> 01:11.905
(vacuum stops)

01:12.039 --> 01:13.341
*

01:14.842 --> 01:16.644
Hello?

01:18.011 --> 01:19.847
Hello?

01:25.519 --> 01:27.321
(Linda gasping softly)

01:28.356 --> 01:29.823
(whimpering)

01:32.426 --> 01:34.094
(yelping)

01:36.497 --> 01:37.931
(gasping)

01:39.533 --> 01:40.834
(screaming)

01:47.040 --> 01:49.076
(music playing faintly
in earbuds)

01:52.246 --> 01:54.282
(loud pounding)

01:57.251 --> 01:58.786
Mom?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.523
(whimpering)
Hey, I thought

02:02.623 --> 02:03.891
you said you weren't
gonna be home until later.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.393
Amy.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.096
Is that blood?

02:09.230 --> 02:11.098
There was an accident at work.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.766
Everything is gonna be okay.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.269
I need you to go pack a bag.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.705
W-We're gonna take a trip, okay?
Mom,

02:17.805 --> 02:19.473
what's going on?
Amy, just please,

02:19.607 --> 02:21.775
go pack a bag now.
(knocking at door)

02:21.909 --> 02:23.611
OFFICER:
Linda Bloom. NYPD.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.879
Open up.
(gasping)

02:25.979 --> 02:27.248
Oh.

02:27.381 --> 02:28.782
(pounding on door)
OFFICER: Linda Bloom!

02:28.916 --> 02:31.652
NYPD. Open the door!
I love you so much.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.987
What did you do?

02:34.955 --> 02:37.591
And this is us at Haleakala.

02:37.725 --> 02:38.959
You should have seen it.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.229
His entire personality
just lit up.

02:41.329 --> 02:43.464
Aw. I'm so glad you guys
had that time together.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.299
Yeah, it was a great trip.

02:45.433 --> 02:48.101
I'm also glad that
you and I can do this again.

02:48.236 --> 02:51.339
You know, have
a friendly relationship.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.140
Me too.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.109
Truth is, though,

02:56.244 --> 02:57.845
this trip wasn't just
to visit my family.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.513
I had an interview

02:59.647 --> 03:01.415
for a job while we were there.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.183
A job? Really?

03:03.317 --> 03:05.085
I just found out that I got it.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.454
(chuckles)

03:06.587 --> 03:07.788
You're moving to Hawaii?

03:07.921 --> 03:10.190
That's the plan.
Wow.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.925
(short chuckle) I mean...

03:12.025 --> 03:12.993
congratulations.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.795
Thank you.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.165
Sorry, this is just
a lot to process.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.634
Um... (scoffs)

03:20.768 --> 03:22.536
Mauricio is gonna
miss you so much.

03:22.670 --> 03:23.937
I mean, you haven't
told him yet, have you?

03:24.037 --> 03:25.806
No, I thought
we should talk first.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.008
Good.
Because I want
him to come with me.

03:28.141 --> 03:30.043
Before you react,
think about it.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.645
My whole family lives there.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.146
Oh, my God.
He'll grow up
with his cousins.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.147
That's why you brought me here
to tell me,

03:34.282 --> 03:35.649
so I wouldn't freak out?

03:35.783 --> 03:37.017
Flight schedules
between JFK and the Big Island

03:37.150 --> 03:38.519
are pretty good.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.053
Erik, what the hell
are you talking about?

03:40.187 --> 03:42.189
You're asking
if my son can move to Hawaii?

03:42.323 --> 03:43.324
He really did love it.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.558
Of course he loved it!

03:44.692 --> 03:46.494
It's Hawaii!
Can you lower your voice?

03:46.627 --> 03:48.228
Please?
Did you really think

03:48.362 --> 03:50.398
there was a chance in hell
I'd say yes?

03:50.531 --> 03:51.999
I thought we could
at least discuss it.
No,

03:52.132 --> 03:53.467
there's nothing to discuss.

03:54.802 --> 03:55.869
I'm not living
clear across the country

03:56.003 --> 03:57.305
from my six-year-old son.

03:57.405 --> 03:58.639
(phone chimes)

04:00.040 --> 04:01.475
How do you plan
to take care of him

04:01.575 --> 04:03.076
when I'm not here
to pick up your slack?

04:03.210 --> 04:04.978
Pick up my slack?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.814
You work nonstop, Taylor.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.682
Half the weekends
you're supposed to be with him

04:08.816 --> 04:09.983
you call me last second
to cover.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.251
You're doing this
to get back at me.

04:11.385 --> 04:12.720
What?
I hurt your feelings

04:12.853 --> 04:15.188
because I called off
our fling, mistake,

04:15.323 --> 04:17.425
whatever that was,
and now you're getting payback.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.992
Wow. That would be convenient

04:19.092 --> 04:19.860
for you to believe, wouldn't it?
(phone chiming)

04:19.993 --> 04:21.729
This is about my career

04:21.862 --> 04:23.063
and our son...
Are you really

04:23.196 --> 04:24.332
looking at your phone right now?

04:24.432 --> 04:25.699
I have to go.

04:25.833 --> 04:26.867
It's work, isn't it?

04:28.869 --> 04:30.904
When can we finish
this conversation?
Screw you, Erik.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.040
Move anywhere
outside the five boroughs,

04:33.173 --> 04:34.608
you're moving alone.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.215
Good. You're here.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.418
I can't find anything
on Marissa's computer.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.519
It's like everything
is in code.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.087
Can you help?
(sighs)

04:47.220 --> 04:48.856
Not quite the emergency
your 12 texts implied,

04:48.956 --> 04:50.858
but yeah, sure.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.226
I still can't believe Marissa
left without giving us time

04:53.361 --> 04:55.062
to sort all of this out.
Losing her was gonna suck

04:55.195 --> 04:56.530
no matter how much notice
she gave.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.298
Danny. Taylor.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.468
Chunk and I have a 9:00 a.m.
meeting with the new client,

05:00.601 --> 05:02.403
but this dossier is incomplete.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.037
There's no
medical examiner's report?

05:04.137 --> 05:05.573
I didn't know we were
supposed to include that.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.376
Well, if you don't know
something, you ask.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.644
But if we don't know
we're missing something,

05:10.778 --> 05:12.613
how can we know to ask about it?

05:12.746 --> 05:13.781
Have you looked
at the candidates...

05:14.748 --> 05:16.384
...the headhunter sent
to fill in Marissa's job?

05:16.484 --> 05:18.419
We could really use the help.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.087
I haven't, but I will, soon.
CHUNK:
Bull, we got to get going.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.922
I have the ME report right here.
Okay. Good.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.457
There it is. Listen.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.759
I know that we're stretched
a little thin right now

05:25.893 --> 05:27.795
without Marissa, but...

05:27.928 --> 05:30.130
we're gonna get through this
transition stronger than ever.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.965
I promise.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.067
CHUNK:
You're gonna want to take a look
at this on the way over.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.103
She stabbed him in the neck
six times.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.971
Six times?
With a fountain pen.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.073
Ooh. It's gonna be hard to make
that look like an accident.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.308
(prison gate clinking)

05:41.442 --> 05:44.111
Connor was my boss.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.614
But he was also my friend.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.517
We worked together
for 20 years.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.586
We had hundreds of arguments

05:52.686 --> 05:54.822
about hundreds of projects,

05:54.955 --> 05:56.490
but this time...

05:57.525 --> 06:00.327
I got so frustrated. (sighs)

06:00.461 --> 06:02.162
I just snapped.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.164
Were you having a romantic

06:04.297 --> 06:06.266
or a sexual relationship
with the victim?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.868
No.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.603
Was he harassing you
in any way?

06:09.703 --> 06:12.606
Connor? No. Never.
CHUNK: Ms. Bloom,

06:12.706 --> 06:15.042
is there any information
you can give us

06:15.175 --> 06:17.445
that could help a jury
understand why you did this?

06:18.446 --> 06:20.614
He kept waving his pen around.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.519
Really pissed me off.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.390
I don't understand it, either.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.027
I killed a man.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.031
How can I live with that?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.503
How do I explain that to Amy?

06:44.337 --> 06:45.839
And according to
the police report,

06:45.973 --> 06:48.041
she was home at the time
you were arrested?

06:48.175 --> 06:49.677
It was awful.

06:51.512 --> 06:55.549
How scared she looked
when they took me.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.752
Who's watching her now?

06:58.886 --> 07:01.421
She's at an emergency
foster care center.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.356
Is her father in the picture?

07:05.025 --> 07:06.894
I used a sperm donor

07:07.027 --> 07:08.428
to get pregnant.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.697
Amy doesn't have
any other family.

07:09.830 --> 07:10.764
It's always been just us

07:10.898 --> 07:13.400
against the world.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.235
But now...

07:16.369 --> 07:19.106
I can't bear to think of her
in foster care.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.409
Is there anything...

07:22.543 --> 07:24.945
is there anything at all
you can do to help me?

07:25.078 --> 07:27.214
To be honest,
I'm not sure there is

07:27.347 --> 07:28.415
anything we can do to help you,

07:28.549 --> 07:31.051
but I think we can help Amy.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.419
How?

07:32.553 --> 07:34.421
Sometimes
the prosecutor will agree

07:34.555 --> 07:36.123
to delay a prison sentence

07:36.256 --> 07:39.760
to accommodate
a family situation.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.596
So we could ask if they will
delay your sentence

07:42.730 --> 07:44.765
until Amy's 18th birthday.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.199
What do you think?
I think that

07:46.299 --> 07:48.602
we'd have to beg the A.D.A.

07:48.736 --> 07:51.271
And she'd probably require
that you a plea agreement

07:51.404 --> 07:53.273
to second degree murder,
which carries

07:53.406 --> 07:55.543
a hefty prison sentence.
Whatever it takes.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.779
I'm willing to do it.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.648
Thank you.
Don't thank us yet.

08:00.781 --> 08:03.784
We'll reach out to the A.D.A.,
see if she bites.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.452
I understand.

08:05.586 --> 08:09.289
(sniffles) And, um,
if you're my legal team now...

08:11.258 --> 08:13.493
...can I ask you
to do one more thing?

08:17.731 --> 08:20.233
Hey. Amy?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.469
I'm not coming inside.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.071
Stop asking.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.507
(blows) Well...

08:27.641 --> 08:29.309
I like the cold.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.244
Stimulates
brain activity.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.446
I'm Dr. Jason Bull.

08:33.581 --> 08:36.116
I'm part of
your mother's legal team.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.985
Are you gonna get my mom
out of jail?

08:38.118 --> 08:41.454
When can I go home?
Tonight?

08:41.589 --> 08:43.156
I'm sorry, I...

08:43.290 --> 08:44.157
Not tonight.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.993
When?

08:46.126 --> 08:49.196
I don't have an answer
to that question yet.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.799
Did she really kill her boss?

08:51.932 --> 08:54.501
That's what
they're saying online.
Right.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.503
I don't understand.

08:56.637 --> 08:57.671
Why?

08:59.673 --> 09:01.308
I don't have an answer
for that, either.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.711
Your mom was
worried about you.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.445
She tried to
call you today,

09:05.545 --> 09:07.681
but you were in school,
so she asked me to come by,

09:07.815 --> 09:10.017
see how you were doing.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.619
How are they treating you
in here?

09:11.719 --> 09:14.487
Everyone's nice, I guess.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.557
They told me I could see her
this weekend.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.326
You nervous about that?

09:19.459 --> 09:21.228
I don't know.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.298
*

09:28.201 --> 09:31.304
Listen, it's understandable.

09:32.239 --> 09:36.343
Seeing her in there would
make it real, right?

09:37.344 --> 09:40.347
We were supposed to go hiking
this weekend.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.150
On the Appalachian Trail.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.719
I am so sorry, Amy.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.521
And I know your
mom is, too.

09:48.656 --> 09:51.258
You have to know...

09:51.391 --> 09:54.594
that whatever happened,

09:54.728 --> 09:57.831
it can't change
how much she loves you.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.943
How is she?

10:10.077 --> 10:13.080
She's okay.
She's confused.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.581
That's to be expected.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.917
She said everyone
is treating her well.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.086
Is she gonna come visit me
this weekend?

10:20.087 --> 10:21.922
I think you need to
give her some time.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.391
CHUNK:
But we do have

10:24.524 --> 10:25.693
some good news.

10:25.793 --> 10:26.960
The A.D.A. agreed

10:27.094 --> 10:28.461
to delay the start
of your sentence

10:28.595 --> 10:30.397
until Amy's 18th birthday.

10:30.530 --> 10:33.100
But, as predicted,

10:33.233 --> 10:34.634
it's a hefty sentence.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.437
(sighs)
25 years?

10:37.570 --> 10:39.306
She wanted life.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.274
This was the best
that we could do.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.442
This is a gift, Linda.

10:42.575 --> 10:43.711
It means that
you can pick up Amy

10:43.811 --> 10:46.446
from foster care
and take her home,

10:46.579 --> 10:48.081
and she will never go back.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.450
You'll be under house arrest
until you go to prison,

10:50.583 --> 10:53.320
but you'll be together.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.790
(sniffles)

10:56.924 --> 10:58.458
Three years to prepare
my daughter

10:58.591 --> 11:00.327
for life without me.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.097
It's worth it.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.407
Linda?
Hmm?

11:14.507 --> 11:16.243
The pen?

11:16.343 --> 11:18.011
What about it?

11:18.145 --> 11:19.446
You're writing

11:19.579 --> 11:20.613
with the wrong end.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.015
What do you mean?
Here, try mine.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.151
Which end are you
supposed to write with?

11:28.088 --> 11:29.823
This one, right?

11:31.258 --> 11:33.093
Don't sign.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.261
I don't think
you're guilty

11:34.361 --> 11:36.163
of murdering your boss.

11:38.598 --> 11:40.633
*

11:56.950 --> 12:00.020
It's a large
but benign meningioma covering

12:00.153 --> 12:02.022
the frontotemporal lobe.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.825
Uh, there's no way to know
how long the tumor's been there,

12:04.958 --> 12:06.493
but based on skull bone erosion,

12:06.626 --> 12:09.696
I can see that it caused
massive brain swelling

12:09.830 --> 12:10.998
over just the past month,

12:11.131 --> 12:12.332
which I'm sure has had

12:12.465 --> 12:14.802
a significant effect
on your behavior.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.004
A brain tumor?

12:18.705 --> 12:20.573
What kind of effects?

12:20.707 --> 12:23.643
Difficulty with motor skills,
mood swings,

12:23.743 --> 12:27.647
trouble regulating your impulses
during moments of stress.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.852
Is it, um, fatal?

12:31.985 --> 12:33.420
No, Linda,
the mass won't kill you.

12:33.553 --> 12:34.988
The procedure
to remove it

12:35.088 --> 12:37.858
does have a high rate
of mortality.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.259
How high?

12:39.392 --> 12:40.427
Fifty percent.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.095
So, my recommendation is

12:42.229 --> 12:45.565
to start you on a course
of anti-inflammatory steroids

12:45.698 --> 12:47.935
immediately.
That should remedy

12:48.068 --> 12:51.104
the behavioral symptoms
that I just mentioned

12:51.238 --> 12:53.506
and help you learn
to live with it.

12:54.441 --> 12:58.411
I'm gonna give you a few moments
to, uh, process all that.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.414
Thank you.
Thanks.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.919
(door closes)

13:06.053 --> 13:07.120
I'm so sorry.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.256
No.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.591
Now I know. (scoffs)

13:11.724 --> 13:13.760
It was the tumor.
BULL: This...

13:13.894 --> 13:15.628
is gonna be a help
to our defense.

13:15.762 --> 13:18.365
We put an expert on the
stand who says that

13:18.465 --> 13:19.933
this abnormal mass
is responsible

13:20.067 --> 13:22.535
for your erratic,
violent behavior.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.937
That's gonna have an impact.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.973
CHUNK:
Look, Linda, I can't imagine

13:26.106 --> 13:28.108
how relieved you must feel

13:28.241 --> 13:31.244
to have an explanation for
why you did what you did,

13:31.378 --> 13:34.081
but we currently have a
very good deal on the table.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.448
And if we go to trial...

13:35.582 --> 13:38.051
All of that goes away.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.422
Three years with my daughter.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.824
But if we win...

13:44.958 --> 13:47.760
I get to spend
the rest of my life with Amy.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.130
DANNY: Automatism?

13:50.263 --> 13:51.999
Translates as "machine
that moves."

13:52.132 --> 13:54.101
We are gonna argue that Linda
was not in control of her body

13:54.234 --> 13:56.003
when she stabbed her boss.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.770
The A.D.A. was not happy
when we pulled out of that deal,

13:57.905 --> 14:00.173
and she's gonna be coming
at us with both barrels.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.242
Danny, I need hard evidence

14:02.342 --> 14:04.411
that Linda's ability
to control her impulses

14:04.511 --> 14:05.946
was diminished by...

14:07.014 --> 14:11.151
We, the jury, find the defendant
guilty on all counts.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.486
What?
"Diminished by" is too passive.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.988
This tumor

14:15.122 --> 14:17.124
is a villain in the story.

14:17.257 --> 14:18.425
So we need words that

14:18.525 --> 14:19.526
show that this tumor

14:19.659 --> 14:21.161
attacked Linda's brain.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.795
It disfigured her personality.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.364
She had no motive.

14:24.497 --> 14:25.665
She had no history of violence.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.334
This tumor...

14:27.467 --> 14:29.036
made her do it.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.337
Okay, I have a question.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.804
Since we're adding

14:31.939 --> 14:33.040
another case
to the schedule,

14:33.173 --> 14:34.541
have you had a chance

14:34.674 --> 14:37.177
to look at the candidates
to replace Marissa?

14:37.310 --> 14:39.046
Yes, I have.
(sighs) Good.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.180
Thank you.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.781
Then I threw them all away,

14:41.881 --> 14:44.184
and then I asked the
headhunter for better options.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.853
DANNY: So,

14:46.987 --> 14:48.288
who's gonna handle
the mirror jury

14:48.388 --> 14:49.722
on this case?
Well, I have full faith

14:49.856 --> 14:52.525
you can handle
the mirror jury selection,

14:52.659 --> 14:54.561
and that you are gonna do
a fantastic job

14:54.694 --> 14:56.363
with the algorithm.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.865
Now, I know that
Marissa has left...

14:58.999 --> 15:00.700
some big shoes to fill here.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.537
But it would
be a mistake to rush

15:04.671 --> 15:06.706
and fill them too soon.

15:11.844 --> 15:14.081
(elevator dings)

15:15.848 --> 15:17.584
*

15:19.419 --> 15:20.720
Hi, Ms. Morgan.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.322
We're so excited
that you're here.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.524
I'll show you to your office.
Thank you.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.029
Can I get you anything?

15:29.162 --> 15:30.897
Um...
Morning, Ms. Morgan.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.399
Good morning.
No, thank you.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.201
Actually, a cup of coffee
would be great,

15:34.334 --> 15:35.335
if it's not too much trouble.
Hi, Marissa.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.536
Hello.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.772
Bradley.
Marissa.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.674
Welcome.
So jazzed you're here.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.044
This is an amazing space.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.046
The pictures do
not do it justice.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.947
Let me show you your office.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.518
You ready?

15:51.618 --> 15:53.086
After you.

15:54.887 --> 15:57.224
This is fantastic.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.791
Not bad, huh?

15:58.925 --> 16:01.361
Wow. (chuckles)

16:01.461 --> 16:03.596
Oh. Is this the case
about the Rikers inmate

16:03.730 --> 16:05.065
who died in custody?
Yes.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.733
I was hoping we could dive
right in.

16:06.866 --> 16:07.934
Voir dire starts tomorrow.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.070
Of course.
Now, my instinct

16:10.203 --> 16:11.771
is to target jurors

16:11.904 --> 16:13.540
who see themselves
as down on their luck,

16:13.640 --> 16:15.375
who've made mistakes in life

16:15.475 --> 16:18.311
and will overlook the crimes
that put the victim in prison

16:18.445 --> 16:19.712
in the first place.
W... Uh,

16:19.812 --> 16:21.748
that makes sense.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.116
Great.
Yeah, but I don't think

16:23.250 --> 16:24.751
we should rule out
the other direction.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.953
Seat jurors
who don't make mistakes,

16:27.087 --> 16:29.056
who can't fathom
an institution

16:29.156 --> 16:30.823
tolerating the conditions
that killed him.

16:30.957 --> 16:33.760
I don't think that the
big money is awarded by

16:33.893 --> 16:35.562
a jury who empathizes
with the victim.

16:35.662 --> 16:39.232
I think we want a jury
outraged by the defendant.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.968
Yeah.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.636
Okay, let's do it your way.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.072
Oh, wait, what?

16:45.172 --> 16:46.806
No, I-I mean, I was
just spitballing.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.441
I think we should
talk about it some more.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.410
(chuckles) Marissa,

16:50.510 --> 16:52.612
you want to know
the secret to my success?

16:54.147 --> 16:55.848
I only work with people
who are smarter than me.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.784
And when they talk,

16:57.917 --> 16:59.486
I listen.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.921
*

17:03.690 --> 17:05.625
Your coffee, Ms. Morgan,
with a dash of vanilla.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.161
Saw that's how you like it
on your Insta.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.330
Thank you.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.839
MARISSA:
They know how I like my coffee.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.374
I know how you like your coffee.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.210
I'll make it for you every day
if you come back.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.811
I miss you, too, Taylor.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.546
I knew you did a lot
around here,

17:26.679 --> 17:29.816
but it turns out none of us
knew exactly what you did.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.718
Oh, you guys will figure it out.

17:31.851 --> 17:35.288
Uh, looking back, I realize
I got too comfortable at TAC.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.190
I forgot how important it is

17:37.324 --> 17:39.526
to do something
outside of your comfort zone.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.561
All right, all right.
I'm happy for you.

17:41.694 --> 17:42.862
Thank you.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.133
How's Bull?

17:47.033 --> 17:48.801
If I told you

17:48.901 --> 17:50.470
he's a shell of his former self,

17:50.570 --> 17:52.572
would you consider coming back?

17:55.308 --> 17:58.211
Hey.
Hey.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.580
How you doing?
Uh, good. I'm just...

18:00.713 --> 18:03.350
scrambling to get this brand
strategy deck pulled together.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.417
Ah, yeah.

18:04.551 --> 18:05.852
Well, I hate to interrupt you,

18:05.985 --> 18:08.355
but, um, I need your help.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.689
With...

18:09.822 --> 18:11.824
The headhunter
sent over candidates

18:11.924 --> 18:14.161
for Marissa's replacement,
and...

18:14.261 --> 18:16.363
I just...

18:16.496 --> 18:18.365
I'd love to hear your opinion.
I don't know anything

18:18.498 --> 18:20.233
about algorithms or...

18:20.367 --> 18:21.568
or trial science.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.403
It's not really
about any of that.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.071
It's about your feelings
about the people.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.539
I mean, you're a really good
judge of character.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.175
You're good with people.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.443
Says the man with several PhDs
in human behavior.

18:30.577 --> 18:31.444
Please.

18:31.578 --> 18:32.745
I know you're busy,

18:32.879 --> 18:33.780
but I could really
use some help.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.915
DANNY:
Sorry, Bull.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.617
I've been having some trouble
recruiting mirror jurors.

18:37.750 --> 18:38.885
Another one just backed out.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.553
Backed out?
How many is that?

18:40.687 --> 18:42.021
Four.
Four?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.056
Hire another Marissa.
Hey, no, no, no, no.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.959
We-we are gonna hire
another Marissa.

18:47.093 --> 18:48.361
We are,
but right now...

18:49.696 --> 18:51.231
...we're gonna do things
the old-fashioned way.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.932
I'm gonna go into court.
I'm gonna eyeball the jury.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.434
And then when they go to lunch,

18:54.567 --> 18:56.569
you are gonna eavesdrop
on their conversations.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.371
Uh, is that legal?

18:59.372 --> 19:02.542
Well, the jury is not
supposed to talk about the case

19:02.642 --> 19:03.910
until deliberations.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.278
Sometimes they can't
help themselves,

19:05.412 --> 19:06.646
and if I happen
to overhear them...

19:06.779 --> 19:08.215
BULL:
Technically, they're the ones

19:08.315 --> 19:09.616
breaking the rules.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.652
(whispers):
Thanks for that.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.488
RABKIN:
Mrs. Fritz,

19:15.622 --> 19:17.424
how long did you work
with the defendant

19:17.557 --> 19:18.558
and the victim?

19:18.658 --> 19:20.993
I joined the firm 11 years ago.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.662
But Linda and Connor

19:22.795 --> 19:24.564
had already been
working there.
RABKIN: Did you ever

19:24.664 --> 19:26.633
see them argue?
Yes.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.101
Every once in a while,
they would have a big fight.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.904
Nobody else could speak
to Connor like Linda.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.442
But, clearly, they had
a unique relationship.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.977
A unique relationship.

19:38.110 --> 19:39.479
What do you mean by that?

19:39.612 --> 19:41.914
Well, they had known each other
for years.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.017
But, last month,
Connor told me something

19:45.151 --> 19:47.787
that was really quite shocking.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.489
Objection. Hearsay.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.023
(whispers):
Linda, where is this going?

19:51.157 --> 19:52.292
Your Honor,
if you'll let me proceed,

19:52.425 --> 19:53.326
you'll see that
the victim's statement

19:53.460 --> 19:54.361
falls under the

19:54.494 --> 19:55.862
excited utterance exception.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.597
I'm sorry.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.931
Overruled.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.867
You may answer.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.602
TRUVY:
Connor told me that

20:02.702 --> 20:05.972
he had donated sperm to Linda
so she could have a baby.

20:06.105 --> 20:07.674
He said that

20:07.807 --> 20:10.810
he was her daughter's
biological father.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.445
RABKIN:
And...

20:12.545 --> 20:14.213
did the victim say
if there was a reason

20:14.347 --> 20:16.483
he was suddenly
telling you this?

20:16.616 --> 20:19.519
He... said he had decided

20:19.652 --> 20:22.622
he wanted to be
a part of his daughter's life.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.223
But Linda was against it.

20:26.493 --> 20:27.827
No further questions,
Your Honor.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.963
So, if Marissa were talking
in your ear right now,

20:31.063 --> 20:32.399
what do you think she'd say?

20:32.532 --> 20:34.401
She'd say our client
has a motive

20:34.534 --> 20:37.036
and the board is as red
as that bloody pen.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.211
Our defense depends
on convincing the jury

20:45.345 --> 20:47.380
that your brain tumor
is the only logical explanation

20:47.514 --> 20:49.382
for why you stabbed
Connor Gilliam.

20:49.516 --> 20:50.883
It is the only
logical explanation!
And the A.D.A.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.251
is now going to say

20:52.385 --> 20:53.420
that you and Connor
had a fight.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.021
And what was
that fight about?

20:55.154 --> 20:57.657
Well, he wanted to
tell his daughter the truth:

20:57.757 --> 20:59.359
that he was
her biological father.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.361
But the argument was about work.
The A.D.A. is

21:01.494 --> 21:03.563
gonna say that
this brain tumor of yours

21:03.696 --> 21:05.565
is nothing but
a convenient excuse

21:05.698 --> 21:07.099
to get away with murder.
Look,

21:07.233 --> 21:08.335
15 years ago,

21:08.435 --> 21:10.236
when I wanted to get pregnant,
Connor

21:10.370 --> 21:12.572
offered to donate sperm.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.173
But from the start,
he was the one

21:14.273 --> 21:15.542
who did not want to be involved

21:15.675 --> 21:16.909
in Amy's life.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.711
Then, suddenly,
he changed his mind.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.113
I was surprised, sure,
but I was not angry.

21:21.247 --> 21:24.517
I'm not even sure
I was, um, against it,

21:24.617 --> 21:26.419
like Truvy said.
Point is,

21:26.553 --> 21:28.287
none of this even came up
that night.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.723
Then why did you lie to us
when we asked you if there was

21:30.857 --> 21:32.559
any kind of relationship
between you and Connor?

21:32.692 --> 21:34.260
Well...

21:34.394 --> 21:36.929
on top of everything else
I've put my daughter through,

21:37.063 --> 21:40.266
how could I let her
find out now

21:40.400 --> 21:43.403
that the man I killed
was her father?

21:45.938 --> 21:47.440
I was hoping
it wouldn't come out.

21:47.574 --> 21:49.108
Well, despite
your best efforts,

21:49.241 --> 21:50.977
she is gonna find out,

21:51.110 --> 21:53.580
because the prosecutor's
gonna call her next.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.883
RABKIN:
Amy,

21:56.983 --> 21:58.451
is it true that
you learned today,

21:58.585 --> 21:59.919
for the first time,

22:00.052 --> 22:02.389
that the man
your mother stabbed to death

22:02.489 --> 22:03.990
was your biological father?

22:04.991 --> 22:06.258
Yes.

22:06.393 --> 22:08.428
RABKIN:
Had you ever met him before?

22:08.561 --> 22:10.963
A bunch of times.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.665
At her work potlucks.

22:12.799 --> 22:13.766
So...

22:13.900 --> 22:15.435
your mother

22:15.568 --> 22:16.736
introduced you to Connor,

22:16.836 --> 22:19.171
the man she killed,

22:19.305 --> 22:20.973
but she never said
that he was your father?

22:21.107 --> 22:23.142
Objection.
Asked and answered, Your Honor.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.777
Sustained.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.651
RABKIN:
Amy, have you been to visit
your mother in prison?

22:33.420 --> 22:34.454
No.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.188
RABKIN:
Why not?

22:37.757 --> 22:39.258
Because I'm scared of her.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.694
No further questions,
Your Honor.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.698
JAVONOVICH:
Your witness, Mr. Palmer.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.967
No. No more.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.503
(whispers):
Linda, we have to do some damage
control on that testimony.

22:50.637 --> 22:51.804
She has been through enough.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.440
BULL:
I know this is difficult,

22:53.540 --> 22:55.041
but our job is to keep you
out of prison.

22:55.174 --> 22:57.877
My job is to protect
my daughter.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.679
Get her down from there,
right now.

22:59.812 --> 23:00.847
Mr. Palmer?

23:02.982 --> 23:06.185
We have no questions
for this witness, Your Honor.

23:08.488 --> 23:09.822
Oh.

23:09.956 --> 23:10.890
(both chuckle)

23:11.023 --> 23:12.659
Well, fancy meeting you here.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.961
I wondered
how long it would take.

23:15.962 --> 23:16.829
How's the new gig?

23:16.963 --> 23:18.364
Uh, new gig is good.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.533
Uh, great, actually.

23:20.667 --> 23:21.534
And TAC?

23:21.668 --> 23:23.736
Oh, well, you know TAC.

23:24.971 --> 23:27.907
Everybody really misses you.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.308
I miss them, too.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.977
Say hi for me.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.580
Uh, doing anything fun today?

23:33.713 --> 23:34.881
Client's being charged
with murder.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.549
Even her daughter
blames her for it.

23:36.683 --> 23:37.884
So, not fun.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.351
How about you?
Uh,

23:39.486 --> 23:41.588
voir dire-- wrongful death
at Rikers Island.

23:41.721 --> 23:44.090
Oh. Rikers. I heard about that.

23:44.223 --> 23:45.992
Well, don't fall
for the sympathy trap.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.727
If I were you,
I would look

23:47.860 --> 23:49.596
for type A professionals,
who are pr...
Actually,

23:49.729 --> 23:51.698
Bull, I-I've got this one.

23:52.699 --> 23:53.900
Of course you do.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.168
See you around.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.838
Oh, sorry.
Okay, so... Oh. (chuckles)

24:02.374 --> 24:03.510
TAYLOR:
I'm sorry.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.512
Something came up
at work, and...

24:05.612 --> 24:08.715
I know, I know.
I'll be home in no more than...

24:08.848 --> 24:11.250
30 minutes.

24:11.383 --> 24:13.920
Did Mauricio go to sleep okay?

24:14.053 --> 24:15.788
MAN:
Ms. Rentzel?

24:15.922 --> 24:18.190
Yes?
I'm Special Agent Delgado,

24:18.290 --> 24:19.926
this is agent Chamblee,

24:20.059 --> 24:23.429
from the FBI's National Cyber
Investigative Joint Task Force.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.031
Can we talk?

24:26.566 --> 24:28.635
I'll be home as soon as I can.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.439
Ms. Rentzel, you recently
met a young woman

24:33.573 --> 24:35.274
by named Zola Macer,

24:35.407 --> 24:37.777
a hacker, goes by Tidal online.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.579
What's this about?
CHAMBLEE:
Tell us how you and Tidal

24:39.712 --> 24:41.413
have been spending
your time together.

24:42.414 --> 24:44.083
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and assume

24:44.216 --> 24:45.785
you already know
the answer to that.

24:45.918 --> 24:48.287
We've been penetration-testing
corporate computer networks,

24:48.420 --> 24:50.557
but making all of
the appropriate disclosures.

24:50.657 --> 24:51.624
It's totally legal.

24:51.758 --> 24:53.459
It would have been...

24:54.961 --> 24:56.796
...if she didn't steal
a treasure trove of data

24:56.929 --> 24:58.898
from Bressadyne Labs
and sell it online.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.000
I don't know
anything about that.

25:01.133 --> 25:02.468
Well, we traced the intrusion
that gave her access

25:02.602 --> 25:03.970
back to your laptop.

25:04.103 --> 25:07.006
That makes you just
as responsible as her.

25:07.139 --> 25:08.407
You must know I used to work for

25:08.507 --> 25:09.676
the Department
of Homeland Security.

25:09.809 --> 25:11.410
If I thought I was
doing anything wrong,

25:11.510 --> 25:13.512
don't you think I would've
covered my digital tracks?

25:16.015 --> 25:17.650
I have a son.

25:19.085 --> 25:21.020
Lucky for your son,
we don't want you.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.790
We want Tidal.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.694
(sighs)

25:28.695 --> 25:32.098
Look, I'm far from a expert
on cyber law,

25:32.198 --> 25:34.466
but from what I see here,
the FBI has enough

25:34.601 --> 25:37.770
to make your life
very difficult.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.872
Like, "ten years in prison"
difficult.

25:40.006 --> 25:41.608
I don't even know
how this is happening.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.876
I mean, it was just
a fun little side project,

25:44.010 --> 25:45.277
a hobby.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.713
I didn't do anything illegal.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.380
I didn't say it was
impossible, Taylor,

25:48.514 --> 25:49.949
but it would be
an uphill battle.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.384
And, look, if this agent
is willing to walk away

25:52.518 --> 25:54.887
in exchange for you gathering
evidence against Tidal,

25:55.021 --> 25:55.988
then I'd say do it.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.356
She's my friend.

25:57.489 --> 25:59.191
When I needed help,
she helped me.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.027
But she also lied to you
and dragged you into this mess.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.362
It just doesn't
sound like Tidal.

26:03.495 --> 26:05.297
She might skirt the law,

26:05.397 --> 26:06.565
but she has a moral code.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.067
I think it's honorable

26:08.200 --> 26:10.837
that you want to protect
your new friend, I do.

26:10.970 --> 26:14.406
But it seems to me like
it's either her or you.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.914
IZZY:
Hey, Super Dad.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.717
Mm. You've been working on that
for a while.

26:24.851 --> 26:26.585
No, I've actually put it
together twice,

26:26.719 --> 26:27.887
and I have to keep
taking it apart,

26:28.020 --> 26:29.421
because...

26:29.555 --> 26:30.823
You know
what's irritating?

26:30.923 --> 26:32.224
Extra pieces.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.393
And this jigamabob

26:34.526 --> 26:36.763
is not even
in the instruction manual.

26:36.896 --> 26:37.897
Why do they do that?

26:38.030 --> 26:39.732
I can't help you there.

26:39.866 --> 26:42.735
But, you know what, I did
take a look at the résumés.

26:42.869 --> 26:44.904
Yeah?
Yeah.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.839
I wasn't going to at first,
but then it occurred to me

26:46.939 --> 26:48.875
you were probably
counting on that.

26:49.876 --> 26:51.277
What does that mean?

26:51.410 --> 26:53.045
It means I think

26:53.179 --> 26:54.681
you've been dragging your feet
hiring someone new,

26:54.781 --> 26:56.215
because the moment you do,
you have to admit

26:56.348 --> 26:58.217
that it's real that Marissa's
not coming back.

26:58.350 --> 27:03.122
Okay. What kind of half-baked
armchair psychobabble is that?

27:03.255 --> 27:04.957
No.
No?

27:05.091 --> 27:06.192
No. Ridiculous.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.127
Mm. Okay.

27:10.562 --> 27:12.631
(sighs) Okay, maybe
there's a grain of truth

27:12.765 --> 27:14.901
in there somewhere,
on a subconscious level.

27:15.034 --> 27:17.737
Marissa and I have worked
together a long time.

27:17.870 --> 27:20.139
She started the company
with me, and...

27:23.109 --> 27:24.643
...I may be
a little worried that

27:24.777 --> 27:26.278
I won't be able to do it
without her.

27:26.412 --> 27:29.115
Well, you can always
become a mechanic.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.618
That's emasculating, actually.

27:32.752 --> 27:33.619
Jason,

27:33.753 --> 27:36.756
Marissa's gone, but...

27:36.889 --> 27:38.457
you have a group of very

27:38.590 --> 27:41.093
talented people
still working for you.

27:41.227 --> 27:42.795
So stop torturing them

27:42.929 --> 27:44.931
and bring this very talented man

27:45.064 --> 27:46.465
in for an interview.

27:46.598 --> 27:48.667
You're welcome.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.436
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

27:52.638 --> 27:53.639
(groans)

27:53.773 --> 27:55.341
Jared?

27:55.474 --> 27:57.844
CHUNK:
Dr. Mittman, are you
saying that the tumor

27:57.977 --> 28:00.512
that was laying siege
to my client's brain

28:00.646 --> 28:03.816
caused her to lose control
and stab Connor Gilliam?

28:03.950 --> 28:05.785
Yes, that's correct.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.854
But as the prosecutor
has said multiple times,

28:07.987 --> 28:09.021
my client doesn't have

28:09.155 --> 28:10.790
a history of
violent outbursts

28:10.923 --> 28:12.358
or attacking other people.

28:12.491 --> 28:13.625
How is this possible?

28:13.760 --> 28:15.094
Well, people
can live

28:15.194 --> 28:16.595
with brain tumors for years

28:16.695 --> 28:18.264
before they become
clinically significant.

28:18.364 --> 28:21.768
The injury to Linda's brain

28:21.868 --> 28:23.669
only very recently
reached a tipping point

28:23.803 --> 28:26.005
and began altering her behavior.

28:26.138 --> 28:27.373
How recently?
Well,

28:27.506 --> 28:29.508
based on her skull bone erosion,

28:29.641 --> 28:31.811
I'd say one month
before the incident.
(whispers): Linda,

28:31.944 --> 28:33.312
keep eyes on the witness.

28:33.445 --> 28:35.447
If you're disinterested,
the jury will be, too.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.549
Sorry, I was looking for Amy.
None of this matters

28:37.683 --> 28:39.151
if she doesn't hear it.
CHUNK: One month.

28:40.152 --> 28:41.153
Members of the jury,

28:41.287 --> 28:43.322
please keep that number
in mind.

28:43.455 --> 28:44.791
Now, doctor,

28:44.891 --> 28:46.525
on this TV screen
you'll see a scan

28:46.658 --> 28:48.060
of my client's signature

28:48.194 --> 28:49.896
on a check from
one month ago.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.630
Keep watching.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.566
What you'll see now are
scans of Linda's signature,

28:54.700 --> 28:57.203
leading up to the night
in question.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.539
During which time,
you just testified,

29:00.672 --> 29:04.376
this tumor was
crushing her brain.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.412
Do you notice any difference?

29:08.514 --> 29:10.883
Her signature
changed dramatically.

29:11.017 --> 29:12.919
Are you surprised
by that, doctor?

29:13.052 --> 29:15.054
Not at all.
It makes perfect sense

29:15.187 --> 29:18.157
that the brain's motor strip
was impacted first.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.591
See, the changes

29:19.725 --> 29:21.060
in Linda's handwriting

29:21.193 --> 29:23.162
were a warning sign
of what was to come.

29:23.262 --> 29:26.899
Unfortunately, nobody noticed
until it was too late.

29:27.033 --> 29:29.902
For Linda and for
the man she killed.

29:30.036 --> 29:31.737
Doctor, it almost sounds like

29:31.871 --> 29:34.773
Linda is a victim
in all of this, too.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.110
In a way, she is.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.581
No further questions,
Your Honor.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.354
BULL:
The jury

29:48.454 --> 29:49.388
can't be against us.

29:49.521 --> 29:52.258
I saw their faces in court.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.426
They know that
the tumor is responsible.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.395
That's it. Case closed.
No.

29:56.528 --> 29:57.729
Case not closed.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.298
I heard a group
of jurors talking

29:59.431 --> 30:00.599
in the courthouse cafeteria.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.268
Here, give this a listen.

30:02.401 --> 30:03.369
WOMAN:
If the tumor really
made her do it,

30:03.469 --> 30:04.971
I feel bad for her.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.572
MAN:
Yeah, I get it.
But if we all agree

30:06.705 --> 30:08.607
she's funny in the head,

30:08.740 --> 30:10.742
then we definitely
can't let her off.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.444
WOMAN: Why not?
MAN: Because the next time

30:12.578 --> 30:15.481
she gets upset, she could snap
and hurt someone else.

30:15.614 --> 30:17.249
WOMAN 2:
You guys, he's right.
She could kill her daughter.

30:17.383 --> 30:19.751
Well, you're half-right.

30:19.886 --> 30:22.221
We convinced them that the tumor
made Linda kill her boss.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.256
But now they want to lock her up

30:24.390 --> 30:27.393
'cause they're afraid
she'll kill again.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.334
DELGADO:
All you have to do is go in,

30:35.467 --> 30:37.904
plug the thumb drive
into Tidal's computer,

30:38.004 --> 30:41.073
wait 60 seconds for
the spyware to install,

30:41.173 --> 30:43.910
then I'll have eyes
on everything she types.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.577
What will she be charged with?

30:45.677 --> 30:48.080
Just plug it in and get out.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.582
Then none of this
will be your problem.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.293
(door opens)

31:03.495 --> 31:05.697
Soccer mom, hi.
Hey.

31:05.831 --> 31:08.200
I was on my way to work
and realized I was close,

31:08.334 --> 31:10.669
so thought I'd stop by
and say hey.

31:10.802 --> 31:11.803
Unannounced
pop-in status.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.639
I like it. Come in.

31:13.772 --> 31:16.375
I can't stay for long.

31:18.110 --> 31:20.612
Ugh, the heat in the subway
was crazy.

31:20.712 --> 31:21.880
Can I have some water?

31:22.014 --> 31:23.349
Sure. You get to take

31:23.482 --> 31:26.185
my new DIY water
filtration system

31:26.318 --> 31:27.519
for a spin.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.855
I can't with the chemicals
this city pours

31:29.989 --> 31:31.723
into its drinking water--
fluoride,

31:31.857 --> 31:34.460
orthophosphate,
sodium hydroxide.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.627
And there's still

31:35.727 --> 31:36.795
mosquito larvae in the water,

31:36.895 --> 31:37.997
so then they dump in

31:38.130 --> 31:38.998
microscopic crustaceans

31:39.131 --> 31:40.832
to eat the larvae.

31:40.967 --> 31:43.535
How nasty is that?

31:43.669 --> 31:45.404
Thank you.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.209
Just gulping the stuff down.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.544
Sheep drinking shrimp.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.846
(clicks tongue)
So lame.

31:56.882 --> 31:58.484
You really need to get

31:58.584 --> 31:59.751
a filtration system.

31:59.885 --> 32:01.320
I can help you
build one.

32:02.721 --> 32:03.990
Did you steal documents

32:04.090 --> 32:05.724
from Bressadyne Labs?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.227
You saw the data dump?

32:08.360 --> 32:10.162
That's why you're here?
So it's true.

32:11.097 --> 32:12.064
I didn't tell you
because I wasn't sure

32:12.198 --> 32:13.399
you wanted to be a part of it.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.067
But I am part of it.
(sets glass down)

32:15.201 --> 32:16.402
My computer made

32:16.535 --> 32:18.104
the first entry.
Okay.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.671
Soccer mom lecture time.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.173
No. Don't do that.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.275
You used me and brought me
into your mess.

32:23.409 --> 32:24.276
Whoa, dial down the drama.

32:24.410 --> 32:25.677
They had it coming.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.079
Oh, so just 'cause
they're Big Pharma

32:27.213 --> 32:28.580
means you can steal from them?

32:29.848 --> 32:31.550
You didn't read the documents.

32:31.683 --> 32:33.119
(scoffs)

32:33.252 --> 32:35.187
Employees overseas
were working so hard

32:35.287 --> 32:37.389
they were dropping dead
on the factory floor.

32:37.523 --> 32:39.091
But when head honchos
found out,

32:39.225 --> 32:40.792
they saw an opportunity

32:40.926 --> 32:42.228
to improve efficiency
and started pitting employees

32:42.361 --> 32:43.595
against each other,

32:43.729 --> 32:45.697
video game style.
How fubar is that?

32:45.797 --> 32:49.201
So, yeah, I posted the documents
where the media could find them.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.771
So, you didn't get paid
for the data?

32:52.904 --> 32:54.373
No. Not a penny.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.413
Unplug your computer.
What?

33:01.547 --> 33:02.781
Unplug your computer now.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.652
Damn it.

33:06.785 --> 33:10.289
No. Another expert witness
is not gonna move the needle.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.491
You don't know that.
It could.
It won't.

33:12.624 --> 33:15.161
Saying that Linda's medication
is 70% effective

33:15.294 --> 33:16.562
at controlling symptoms
is like...

33:16.662 --> 33:19.898
She's still 30% likely
to kill somebody.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.101
Yeah. I hear it now.

33:22.234 --> 33:24.603
We need to convince this jury

33:24.736 --> 33:27.005
that our client's brain tumor
is responsible for the murder.

33:27.139 --> 33:28.974
Already did that.
And simultaneously

33:29.108 --> 33:32.311
that it's not gonna
trigger her to murder again.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.681
(sighs)
That's tougher.

33:35.814 --> 33:37.283
So, what we need here

33:37.416 --> 33:40.486
is something emotional,

33:40.619 --> 33:42.821
visceral. We need...

33:44.123 --> 33:45.257
We need the tumor.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.758
What?

33:46.858 --> 33:48.527
(tapping on glass)
DANNY: Hey, Bull.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.996
There's a guy out here, uh,
says he has an appointment.

33:51.130 --> 33:52.364
Jared Dubow?

33:52.498 --> 33:53.499
Oh.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.201
Thank you. Okay.
Call the prison.

33:55.334 --> 33:58.304
We need to see Linda
before we go to court today.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.274
Hey there, I'm Jason Bull.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.975
Dr. Bull, it's an honor.

34:04.110 --> 34:05.544
I've been a fan of
your work for years.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.779
(chuckles)
Some might call me a superfan.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.181
Well, I bet you say that
to all of the girls.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.783
No, sir. No other girls.
No other meetings.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.785
I have a great job.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.354
It pays me well.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.022
The only reason
I'd even consider leaving

34:17.156 --> 34:18.224
is to work for you.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.992
Well, let's talk in my office.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.532
Who's that?

34:26.665 --> 34:28.367
He said he was here
for an interview.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.170
Maybe the new Marissa.
TAYLOR: Huh.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.574
So you're saying
I should have the surgery.

34:35.707 --> 34:38.076
BULL:
No. No one can make
that decision for you.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.411
What I am telling
you is that

34:39.545 --> 34:41.713
that jury is ready
to convict you.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.516
They're afraid of you.
They're afraid of your tumor.

34:44.650 --> 34:48.254
But if you have it removed...

34:48.387 --> 34:50.021
you're no longer a threat.

34:50.156 --> 34:52.158
And they'll find me innocent?

34:52.258 --> 34:54.360
There's a good chance.
There's also a good chance

34:54.493 --> 34:55.994
you could die
on the operating table.

34:56.094 --> 34:56.995
Let's...

34:57.095 --> 34:58.997
let's all remember that.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.667
Can I even have surgery
in the middle of trial?

35:01.767 --> 35:04.203
We can ask for a continuance.
That's feasible.

35:04.336 --> 35:06.505
Yes, but...

35:06.605 --> 35:08.407
Look, Linda, I know

35:08.540 --> 35:10.342
the prospect of life
in prison sounds grim,

35:10.442 --> 35:13.179
but it's better
than no life at all.

35:16.382 --> 35:18.850
Not if I don't get to spend it
with my daughter.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.018
(scoffs)

35:20.118 --> 35:22.254
Not if she's still scared of me.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.757
Do you really think
this will work?

35:27.393 --> 35:28.960
I think it's your only hope.

35:35.434 --> 35:37.303
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

35:37.436 --> 35:39.471
*

35:50.549 --> 35:53.485
She's okay.
The surgery went well.

35:53.619 --> 35:56.655
But in order to be sure
we got the whole tumor,

35:56.788 --> 35:59.258
we had to make
some tough choices.

36:00.559 --> 36:02.594
*

36:06.765 --> 36:09.501
CHUNK:
Your Honor, the defense would
like to enter into evidence

36:09.635 --> 36:12.103
exhibit R, the meningioma
that was removed

36:12.238 --> 36:16.107
from the area around my client's
frontotemporal lobe.

36:16.242 --> 36:18.810
The procedure was
extremely complex

36:18.944 --> 36:22.248
and, unfortunately, Linda will
experience persistent weakness

36:22.348 --> 36:23.982
of the right leg.

36:24.115 --> 36:28.019
However, we did successfully
remove the entirety of the mass.

36:28.153 --> 36:29.087
CHUNK:
Doctor, what was the weight

36:29.187 --> 36:30.422
of the tumor?

36:30.522 --> 36:32.791
It weighed 12 ounces.
Incredible.

36:32.924 --> 36:35.093
Three-quarters of a pound.

36:35.193 --> 36:38.364
She's been walking around
with this in her head,

36:38.497 --> 36:39.998
mutilating her brain.

36:40.131 --> 36:42.368
Yes, it's not surprising
that her behavior was

36:42.501 --> 36:44.336
so dramatically impacted.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.638
Doctor, now that the tumor
has been removed,

36:46.772 --> 36:49.040
will Linda be subjected to

36:49.174 --> 36:52.177
any further
uncontrolled impulses?

36:52.311 --> 36:55.981
Absolutely not. We achieved
complete resection of the tumor.

36:56.114 --> 36:57.148
There's nothing left,

36:57.283 --> 36:58.717
and it won't grow back.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.486
Aside from the
motor weakness,

37:00.619 --> 37:01.853
there'll be
no lingering effects.

37:01.987 --> 37:03.389
CHUNK:
No further questions,
Your Honor.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.791
Does this mean I'm gonna
get my mom back?
Amy.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.125
(gavel bangs)
JAVONOVICH: Order in the court.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.160
Please do not
address the witness.

37:09.295 --> 37:11.196
Your Honor, she
deserves an answer.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.964
Sit down, Dr. Bull.
Dr. Mittman,

37:13.064 --> 37:13.965
will you please tell
this young lady

37:14.065 --> 37:15.133
what she needs to hear?

37:15.233 --> 37:17.035
Dr. Bull!
Yes,

37:17.168 --> 37:19.705
your mother
will be herself again.

37:24.175 --> 37:25.210
FOREMAN:
In The State of New York

37:25.344 --> 37:27.245
. Linda Bloom,v

37:27.379 --> 37:29.748
murder in the second degree,

37:29.881 --> 37:32.918
we, the jury, find the defendant

37:33.051 --> 37:34.686
not guilty.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.588
(quiet chatter)

37:36.722 --> 37:38.156
I'm sorry.

37:38.256 --> 37:41.593
It's okay. Shh.
(crying)

37:41.727 --> 37:44.730
Everything's gonna
be okay now, baby girl.

37:46.064 --> 37:47.098
I love you.

37:48.534 --> 37:49.901
DELGADO:
Gentlemen, I'm sure
you recognize

37:50.035 --> 37:52.237
that your client is
in serious trouble.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.440
She not only backed out
of our arrangement,

37:54.573 --> 37:55.741
she tipped off

37:55.874 --> 37:57.543
the subject of
our investigation.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.845
Well, let's talk about
your investigation.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.513
You claim to have
evidence connecting

38:01.613 --> 38:03.715
a data breach to
my client's laptop,

38:03.849 --> 38:06.184
but do you have any
physical evidence

38:06.284 --> 38:07.753
of her being at the keyboard
of said laptop

38:07.886 --> 38:09.254
at the time
of the attack?

38:09.388 --> 38:11.122
How do we know another
bad actor didn't install

38:11.256 --> 38:13.258
a remote access trojan

38:13.392 --> 38:14.760
using Ms. Rentzel's
device as

38:14.893 --> 38:16.428
a springboard to launch
the attack script?

38:16.562 --> 38:18.263
I mean, maybe a prosecutor's
gonna be able to make

38:18.397 --> 38:19.931
a mountain out of that
molehill, maybe not.

38:20.065 --> 38:22.067
But the reason we brought
you here to our offices

38:22.200 --> 38:24.436
is to make one thing
crystal clear.

38:24.570 --> 38:26.805
Under this roof,

38:26.938 --> 38:29.040
Taylor is family.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.275
CHUNK:
And we will pour

38:30.409 --> 38:32.310
everything we have
into fighting you.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.580
We'll clear every paying client
off the schedule.

38:34.713 --> 38:36.548
We'll spend
everything we have.

38:36.648 --> 38:37.949
And for what?

38:38.083 --> 38:39.885
So the FBI can waste

38:39.985 --> 38:41.453
more taxpayer dollars

38:41.587 --> 38:43.054
slapping Ms. Rentzel
on the wrist,

38:43.154 --> 38:46.157
when you know she didn't
do anything wrong.

38:48.293 --> 38:50.962
This is a fight you're
not gonna win, Agent Delgado.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.135
I'll have to discuss

38:57.268 --> 38:59.671
how we proceed
with my superiors.

38:59.805 --> 39:01.940
Let's go.

39:04.576 --> 39:06.111
Ms. Rentzel,

39:06.244 --> 39:07.646
you should be more careful
who you associate with.

39:07.779 --> 39:10.749
Being in the middle of
a criminal investigation

39:10.849 --> 39:12.518
isn't gonna play well
in family court.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.520
Family court?
What are you talking about?

39:14.653 --> 39:16.121
Oh.

39:16.254 --> 39:18.156
I didn't mention that?

39:18.289 --> 39:20.926
I got a call from the attorney
representing Erik Rentzel

39:21.026 --> 39:23.629
about your upcoming
custody hearing.

39:24.630 --> 39:26.097
Good luck with that.

39:31.637 --> 39:34.005
Erik is suing me
for custody of Mauricio?

39:34.139 --> 39:35.006
Taylor.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.708
I'm so sorry.
How does

39:36.842 --> 39:39.645
Erik's attorney
even know about Delgado?

39:39.778 --> 39:41.046
He's probably
having you followed

39:41.179 --> 39:42.380
by a private investigator.

39:44.149 --> 39:45.383
Bull, new guy's here.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.218
Thank you.

39:47.352 --> 39:48.687
Okay, listen,

39:48.820 --> 39:50.021
we're gonna
figure this out.

39:50.155 --> 39:51.490
We've got this.

39:51.623 --> 39:52.724
Take the rest of the day,

39:52.858 --> 39:55.494
and we'll get into this
tomorrow.

39:56.795 --> 39:58.664
Jared.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.499
Here we are.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.534
Welcome, formally, to TAC.

40:02.668 --> 40:05.804
We could use some fresh ideas
and new blood around here.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.205
(clears throat)

40:07.338 --> 40:08.707
This is Chester Palmer,
our lead counsel.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.041
Good to meet you.
I've heard a lot of good things.

40:10.175 --> 40:11.409
Likewise.
Congrats on the verdict,

40:11.543 --> 40:13.178
by the way.
Thanks.

40:13.311 --> 40:14.312
And you've Danny James,
our investigator.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.047
Glad you're here.
Thanks.

40:16.181 --> 40:17.483
I want you all to know

40:17.583 --> 40:19.217
how honored I am
to be a part of this team.

40:19.350 --> 40:20.652
I can't wait to dive in.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.888
Well, who said anything
about waiting?

40:23.021 --> 40:24.422
This is it.

40:24.556 --> 40:26.858
This is the nerve center

40:26.992 --> 40:29.661
of our predictive
behavioral algorithm.

40:31.530 --> 40:34.566
It's a little window into
what people are thinking,

40:34.700 --> 40:36.935
and feeling.

40:40.572 --> 40:42.541
Do you like coffee?
Sure.

40:42.674 --> 40:44.075
I'm gonna get you
a cup of coffee.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.544
Chunk, can you show him
the mock courtroom?

40:45.677 --> 40:47.078
Sure. This way.
Okay, uh...

40:47.212 --> 40:49.180
Sugar, cream?
Perfect.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.782
I knew it. All right.

40:50.916 --> 40:53.118
Right this way, Jared.

40:53.251 --> 40:55.020
*

41:00.792 --> 41:02.293
(elevator dings)

41:04.563 --> 41:06.798
(sighs) come on.

41:26.084 --> 41:28.554
Excuse me,
Marissa Morgan's office?

41:28.654 --> 41:30.922
Uh, is Ms. Morgan
expecting you?

41:31.056 --> 41:32.991
Sir?
She... Sort of, she is.
We're old friends.

41:33.124 --> 41:34.159
Don't worry,
there's no problem.
Sir...

41:35.661 --> 41:37.128
Marissa, can I talk to you?

41:37.262 --> 41:40.832
Uh, could you all give me
just a sec, please?

41:40.966 --> 41:42.568
Thank you.

41:44.469 --> 41:45.904
What the hell
are you doing here?

41:46.004 --> 41:48.006
(sighs) Despite my best efforts,

41:48.139 --> 41:49.608
I found someone
to replace you at TAC.

41:49.741 --> 41:50.976
And he's a terrific guy.

41:51.109 --> 41:52.611
He's a double PhD.

41:52.744 --> 41:54.112
He's got background
in trial science.

41:54.245 --> 41:56.281
Perfect level of chitchat.
You'd love him.

41:56.414 --> 41:58.283
Okay.

41:58.416 --> 42:00.185
So, I found the new Marissa,

42:00.318 --> 42:02.287
but I don't want
the new Marissa.

42:02.420 --> 42:03.589
I want the old Marissa.

42:03.689 --> 42:05.290
I mean, the...
You know, I want

42:05.423 --> 42:07.826
the original Marissa.

42:07.959 --> 42:09.695
(sighs) And I can't put
your name on the door,

42:09.828 --> 42:11.663
'cause my name's
not even on the door.

42:11.797 --> 42:13.599
But I can make you
a full partner.

42:16.101 --> 42:17.535
You barge in here
with this grand gesture

42:17.669 --> 42:19.605
and expect me to come back
because you realized

42:19.705 --> 42:21.039
that it's what you want?

42:24.309 --> 42:26.177
No.

42:26.311 --> 42:28.647
You're too late, Bull.
I'm happy where I am.
