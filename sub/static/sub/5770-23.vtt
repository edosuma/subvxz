18:36.202 --> 18:37.377
OH, NO, NO, YOU DID.

18:37.420 --> 18:40.075

I'M SORRY I RUINED
YOUR PARTY TONIGHT.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.067
OH, NO.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.068

19:21.856 --> 19:24.075
OH, MY GOD.

19:24.119 --> 19:26.165
DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO A DINER?

19:26.208 --> 19:27.862
OH, GOD,
I AM SO SORRY

19:27.905 --> 19:29.211
THAT I TURNED OUT TO BE
SUCH A BAD MENTOR.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.865
NO. NO, MINDY.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.432
THAT STRIPPER POLE
WAS GROSS.

19:32.475 --> 19:33.520
AND, I MEAN,
WHY AM I TRYING

19:33.563 --> 19:34.825
TO IMPRESS
THESE FRAT BOYS ANYWAY?

19:34.869 --> 19:36.392
RIGHT. YOU COULD DO
SO MUCH BETTER.

19:36.436 --> 19:38.264
YES, AND BESIDES,
THEY'RE JUST GONNA TURN OUT

19:38.307 --> 19:39.830
TO BE THESE SAD,
DISGUSTING LOSERS

19:39.874 --> 19:41.180
LIKE THOSE GUYS
THAT WERE FIGHTING OVER YOU.

19:41.223 --> 19:44.052
I AM GLAD
THAT I COULD TEACH YOU THAT.

19:44.095 --> 19:46.750
KATIE, YOU ARE GOING TO BE
SUCH A GOOD DOCTOR.

19:46.794 --> 19:49.057
COME HERE.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.755
OH, IT SMELLS.I'M FINE.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.409
YOU LOOK LIKE A MAGICIAN
WITH FOOD POISONING.

19:53.453 --> 19:55.194
VOILA.
[gags]

19:55.237 --> 19:57.326

20:06.988 --> 20:07.989
NO, LOOK. JUST GIVE ME
A MINUTE, ALL RIGHT?

20:08.032 --> 20:09.251
WHY, SO YOU CAN THROW UP
ON ME AGAIN?

20:09.295 --> 20:10.731
LOOK, I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M NOT SERIOUS ABOUT US

20:10.774 --> 20:12.167
BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO HAITI.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.997
BUT I'M GOING NOW BECAUSE
I'M REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT US.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.477
RIGHT, BECAUSE WHEN
YOU'RE READY TO SETTLE DOWN,

20:17.520 --> 20:18.565
THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS

20:18.608 --> 20:19.609
GO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY
FOR A YEAR.

20:19.653 --> 20:20.784
THAT'S JUST IT.

20:20.828 --> 20:22.046
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO LEAVE FOR A YEAR

20:22.090 --> 20:23.657
WHEN WE'RE MARRIED
AND WE'RE EXPECTING A BABY.

20:30.141 --> 20:31.534
'CAUSE I KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA TURN

20:31.578 --> 20:33.971

INSANE, DEMANDING,

20:34.015 --> 20:35.582
PREGNANT WOMAN
WHO'S GOT, LIKE,

20:35.625 --> 20:37.845
70 POUNDS OF WATER WEIGHT

20:37.888 --> 20:40.064
THAT'S JUST WALKING AROUND TOWN
CRUSHING COP CARS.

20:40.108 --> 20:41.414
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA--

20:41.457 --> 20:42.676
I'M GONNA BE LIKE
A VERY DAINTY--

20:42.719 --> 20:44.286

DONKEY KONG.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.462
YOU'RE GONNA JUST GO TO BARS,
TAKE BARRELS,

20:46.506 --> 20:48.508

ACROSS THE ROOM AT PEOPLE.

20:48.551 --> 20:49.639
OKAY. THAT'S--

20:49.683 --> 20:50.988
THAT'S FUNNY,
BUT THAT IS--

20:51.032 --> 20:52.294

20:52.338 --> 20:54.122
DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED
ON YOUR APPETITE.

20:54.165 --> 20:56.385
YOU'RE GONNA BE SAYING, "CASEY,
GO GET ME MASHED POTATOES,

20:56.429 --> 20:57.995
AND PUT IT
IN AN ICE CREAM CONE."

20:58.039 --> 20:59.301
AND I'M LIKE,
"IT'S 3:00 IN THE MORNING."

20:59.345 --> 21:01.956
AND YOU'RE SAYING,
"I DON'T CARE. I NEED IT NOW."

21:01.999 --> 21:03.131
AND I'LL DO IT.

21:03.174 --> 21:05.133
