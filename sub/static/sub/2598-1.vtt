01:24.418 --> 01:26.221
Not exactly what I
was looking for.

01:26.295 --> 01:29.842
Wait a minute, Bob. This is not
the only option we've got for you.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.430
Phil.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.687
Uh...
Yeah.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.098
Why do it like that,
in grey asparagus,

01:37.181 --> 01:41.653
when you can do it completely
differently in hunter green?

01:42.686 --> 01:43.813
Thank you for your time.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.236
- Bob...
- Bob?

01:49.610 --> 01:50.784
Have a seat.

01:50.861 --> 01:51.905
Who's that?

01:51.987 --> 01:55.949
It's Chris Meyers, one of our
brightest, young junior execs.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.832
He's very, very bright.

01:58.911 --> 02:00.631
You got 60 seconds.

02:03.790 --> 02:08.299
Say hello to the Krayton koala.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.929
He's soft, cuddly, absorbent.

02:11.006 --> 02:14.600
I present to you the new
face of Krayton bath tissue.

02:14.760 --> 02:15.934
Wow!

02:18.472 --> 02:19.593
You got yourselves a client.

02:19.598 --> 02:20.642
Yeah.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.729
Yes!

02:22.851 --> 02:24.856
- Unbelievable.
- He's a genius.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.443
- Hate to admit it, buddy.
- Hey.

02:26.522 --> 02:28.527
- But you really saved my ass.
- Ah!

02:28.607 --> 02:30.219
You've got a big raise
coming to you, pal.

02:30.246 --> 02:31.931
You better believe it,
you cheap bastard.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.453
- Let's go get me pregnant.
- Oh, sounds like a plan.

02:34.530 --> 02:35.822
Chris!

02:35.906 --> 02:37.709
Thank you. Back to work.
Back to work.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.289
- Chris!
- Chris!

02:39.368 --> 02:41.207
It's all I ever wanted.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.208
Chris. Chris!

02:46.124 --> 02:47.678
Hey, Phil. What's up?

02:47.751 --> 02:50.302
What's up?
It's crunch time, dude.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.514
Krayton's coming in
for the redesign pitch today.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.974
Need that bad boy ASA
quick as possible.

02:55.050 --> 02:58.644
Yeah, no, I got all the versions you
wanted done, exactly per your specs.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.807
What's that one right there?

03:00.889 --> 03:02.479
Oh, I actually...

03:02.558 --> 03:04.830
I actually just did a
design of my own, too.

03:04.857 --> 03:06.724
Kind of was hoping
to pitch Krayton.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.491
Cool. Cool.

03:08.564 --> 03:11.411
Why don't you let me take a look at it?
Maybe I can run it up to the big man.

03:11.483 --> 03:14.865
- Yeah, let us give the old look-see.
- That's a great idea, Troy.

03:14.945 --> 03:18.872
I'm just... I'm actually...
I'm really psyched about this one.

03:18.949 --> 03:22.496
And I was kind of hoping to
just take it to him myself.

03:22.578 --> 03:26.884
Well, credit will be given where
credit's due. It's just that... Fuck.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.128
Look at that girl, Troy.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.005
I tell you what.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.553
Why don't you practise
the pitch on me?

03:35.632 --> 03:37.969
Let me hear it one time,
make sure it's in tip-top shape.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.684
You don't wanna go in there and pitch
it to Krayton, look like an asshole.

03:44.016 --> 03:47.528
Okay. I'm Krayton, you're you.
Pitch me.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.772
Well, get ready.

03:51.148 --> 03:55.822
And razzle goes the dazzle.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.914
Don't ever say that again.

03:57.988 --> 04:01.998
I was trying to pick up the energy, but I
heard it coming out, and it felt wrong.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.584
What's with the goblin?

04:05.621 --> 04:07.127
Right there on the K.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.755
No. That's a koala bear.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.126
Why is there a koala bear?

04:11.210 --> 04:12.763
Troy brings up a good point.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.600
Well, I did a ton of research
into buying trends

04:15.672 --> 04:17.642
for more intimate products
like bath tissue.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.767
Yeah. Chris...

04:22.346 --> 04:25.359
I hate to say this to you, buddy.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.725
It's not that cuddly.

04:27.351 --> 04:30.779
It's got black, soulless eyes.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.239
- Like a demon's eyes.
- They are like a demon's eyes.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.285
No, no, they're green.
Demons' eyes are red.

04:35.359 --> 04:36.736
I think you're missing the point.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.113
You gotta imagine yourself
on the toilet, right?

04:39.196 --> 04:42.209
You got your pants around your
ankles, and you just wanna do what?

04:42.282 --> 04:45.497
All you really want is to get
the shit out of your butt.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.499
You wanna relax.

04:47.579 --> 04:50.042
You don't wanna have to
worry about anything,

04:50.069 --> 04:51.995
especially an
Australian devil bear

04:52.042 --> 04:54.806
coming up out of the toilet
and clawing at your nut sack.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.715
Well, I think that
might just be your own

04:56.743 --> 04:58.665
very personal association
with koala bears.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.222
- Is it?
- No.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.688
No, that's the image I got,
too, right away.

05:01.715 --> 05:02.383
You got it, too?

05:02.386 --> 05:03.513
- Yeah.
- Troy got it.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.597
I feel like you guys aren't
letting this sink in.

05:07.057 --> 05:10.439
It just sunk in. Here's the thing. Gotta
call an audible. Not gonna use this.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.690
Let's go with the tried and true.
Should we vote?

05:13.397 --> 05:15.651
Tried and true. All right.

05:15.732 --> 05:16.776
Troy likes it.

05:16.859 --> 05:19.278
I didn't know which way Troy was
gonna go. Thank you, Troy.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.617
All right, just trying to look
out for you, homey G.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.711
Let's go, Troy.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.546
I mean, I don't care
if he's technically your superior.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.501
You don't have to take
that shit off him, man.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.669
Well, technically, I do.
That's what superior means.

05:35.836 --> 05:36.928
Ugh!

05:37.004 --> 05:39.175
- Good morning, Chris.
- Hey.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.430
Jared.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.600
Are you sleeping with Brenda again?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.981
No. Not presently.

05:49.057 --> 05:52.439
But I just gotta tell you, man,
there is something about that girl.

05:52.519 --> 05:56.363
She just unleashes
something primal in me.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.531
I know what you mean.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.161
Hey. Hey!

06:00.611 --> 06:02.698
What's up?

06:02.779 --> 06:05.663
You ladies gossiping again
about all the hot guys in the office?

06:05.741 --> 06:07.247
Uh, busted. Yeah.
Chris and I were just talking about

06:07.326 --> 06:09.746
stripping down to our bra and panties
and having a little tickle fight.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.047
If you're interested in joining,
maybe refereeing?

06:12.122 --> 06:14.590
He's joking.
We've never tickled each other.

06:15.918 --> 06:17.508
We would never do that.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.266
Right.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.096
Um...

06:22.216 --> 06:24.801
Anyway, I'm actually just
here on official HR business.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.059
Just to remind you guys

06:26.136 --> 06:29.233
about the big mystery meeting
in the conference room at 4:00 p.m.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.477
- Hoo! Why all the secrecy?
- I don't know.

06:31.558 --> 06:35.568
Crawford just says it's very important.
So just don't be late, okay?

06:35.646 --> 06:37.485
Okay.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.071
It's a date.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.032
Hmm?

06:44.613 --> 06:46.665
What is wrong with you?

06:46.740 --> 06:49.457
I hate myself.
I'm a horrible person.

06:49.535 --> 06:52.797
You have a heart.
That's about all you have right now.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.592
Hey, Brenda.

06:54.665 --> 06:57.145
Just a reminder, we have a 4:00
meeting in the conference room.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.259
I remember.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.055
Hey, did I show you the
newest addition to the fam?

07:00.128 --> 07:01.339
No.

07:02.381 --> 07:05.228
I'm calling him Sergeant Snuggles.

07:05.926 --> 07:09.722
'Cause he's reporting for duty,
like, every day.

07:09.805 --> 07:12.059
Aw! Brenda,
I didn't know you liked rabbits.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.359
Oh, yeah, right, Lisa.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.450
Did I ever show you this one?

07:18.522 --> 07:20.444
- Oh, is that you?
- Yes.

07:20.524 --> 07:24.367
And that there is Mr Bumbles.
He was my favourite.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.374
When I was eight,
I wanted to marry him.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.951
But society would never allow that.

07:31.577 --> 07:33.961
Well, you never know.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.088
No.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.472
Chris, why aren't you at the pitch?

07:41.545 --> 07:43.985
Phil said Krayton's
not coming until 3:00.

07:44.012 --> 07:45.996
No, it's on the books for 2:15.

07:46.049 --> 07:46.571
What?

07:46.586 --> 07:48.626
Yeah. They're all in
the conference room.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.148
Aw!

07:53.724 --> 07:57.105
In the wild, koala bears
don't need to wipe their bottom.

07:57.186 --> 08:01.492
But if they did, they would ask
Koala Phil how to do it.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.994
I like it! I like it!

08:07.696 --> 08:09.250
Thank you.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.960
Thanks very much.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.670
Thanks, everybody.

08:15.579 --> 08:16.836
Gosh!

08:16.914 --> 08:19.879
How can he just so blatantly
steal my work like that?

08:19.958 --> 08:22.046
"Koala Phil"?
It's not even alliterative.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.215
Yeah. That's the real tragedy.

08:24.296 --> 08:25.924
You know, he's just
gonna homogenise it,

08:25.964 --> 08:28.645
and in the end, it's gonna
look like every other koala.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.936
All right. You know what?
Let's take care of Phil once and for all.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.846
Call my buddy Regg.
He's an Algonquin Indian.

08:32.888 --> 08:35.188
We tell him there's a white guy
fucking up shit for you and your land.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.400
- He'll take care of it. 40 bucks.
- You know what I'm gonna do?

08:37.476 --> 08:39.528
I'm gonna march right into
Mr Crawford's office.

08:39.602 --> 08:40.730
I'm gonna march right in.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.900
I'm gonna tell him exactly what
Phil did, just lay it right out.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.868
You do it. You do it.
Right this wrong.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.448
We shall overcome!

08:48.320 --> 08:51.748
- Where do you think you're going?
- I need to speak to him.

08:51.823 --> 08:52.867
He's in a meeting.

08:52.950 --> 08:53.993
Can you please open the door?

08:54.076 --> 08:55.369
Absolutely not.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.621
Sounds like I'll make
us a tee time, then.

08:57.648 --> 08:59.109
Bring your wallet, bitch.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.050
I'm not a bitch.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.130
- Um, Mr Crawford?
- Yes?

09:03.210 --> 09:04.503
Chris wants a word with you.

09:10.968 --> 09:16.105
Now, Chris, I believe you
believe Koala Phil is your idea.

09:16.181 --> 09:19.111
But sometimes, a person can think that
they came up with something

09:19.184 --> 09:21.070
when it actually came
from somewhere else.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.146
Mr Crawford, that is not
what happened here. I...

09:23.188 --> 09:25.905
Now this sort of thing
happens all the time.

09:25.983 --> 09:30.372
For 25 years, I was convinced
that I invented the BLT.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.914
The bacon-lettuce-and-tomato
sandwich?

09:32.990 --> 09:34.959
Absolutely positive.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.421
I'd brag to women about it.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.415
I tried to convince my friends.

09:38.495 --> 09:41.959
Well, turns out
it dates back to the 19th century.

09:42.040 --> 09:46.300
I must've been exposed to it
when I was a child, and forgotten.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.300
The brain, you know.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.183
So let's just let this one go, okay?

09:50.257 --> 09:52.558
Mr Crawford, Phil stole my work.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.474
Why do you think

09:54.553 --> 09:58.266
I was given the Martin P. Shulman
Award for Excellence in Business?

09:59.308 --> 10:03.318
For beating my meat
in some goddamn jerk-off competition?

10:03.395 --> 10:05.649
It would be a very misleading name
if that were the case.

10:05.731 --> 10:09.741
Not that I couldn't hold my own
in a competition like that.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.372
I could.

10:11.445 --> 10:14.791
I'd be able to perform, no problem.

10:14.865 --> 10:16.039
I'm sure.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.208
No.

10:17.868 --> 10:22.423
I got this award because I know a thing
or two about what I'm doing, God damn it.

10:22.497 --> 10:27.753
And what I want from you, son, is for you
to stop trying to sabotage Phil Trager.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.305
And start trying to emulate him.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.802
Prove to me

10:33.884 --> 10:37.562
that you deserve a place
here on the Crawford team.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.524
Go. Go get 'em.

10:41.058 --> 10:44.107
I did you a favour, bud.

10:44.186 --> 10:47.365
You would've blown that pitch.
Now the koala lives on.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.859
You had no right to do that.
You had no right.

10:49.942 --> 10:52.528
Chris, what is with the
selfish behaviour?

10:52.611 --> 10:56.538
The ideas within these walls
are our ideas. We're a family.

10:56.615 --> 10:57.789
Yeah.

10:57.866 --> 11:02.173
Oh, by the way, if you ever tattletale
on me again, things are gonna get ugly.

11:02.246 --> 11:04.547
Real F-ing ugly.

11:37.072 --> 11:41.034
My entire adult life
has been spent in packaging design.

11:41.118 --> 11:46.717
I've come into this office every day
at 7:00 sharp for the last 27 years.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.546
And that could be any one of you.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.681
Even you back there
with the squidgy face.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.638
If you can show the
teamwork and leadership

11:55.716 --> 11:59.228
necessary to succeed
in this tough economic climate.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.681
But, frankly, I haven't seen
much of that from any of you.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.936
Except, of course, for Phil.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.937
Come on, boss. It's a team sport.

12:07.144 --> 12:09.398
That's why, tomorrow,
I'm sending all of you

12:09.479 --> 12:13.952
on a mandatory two-day, two-night
teamwork leadership wilderness retreat.

12:14.026 --> 12:15.069
What?

12:15.152 --> 12:19.209
Now, I will not be able to
accompany you on this excursion.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.410
But I turn it over
to a man who will.

12:22.492 --> 12:23.785
Thank you.

12:30.626 --> 12:33.046
My name is Storm.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.050
Storm Rothchild.

12:36.632 --> 12:39.135
I'm a certified teamwork instructor.

12:39.218 --> 12:41.305
Now, I know what you're thinking.

12:41.637 --> 12:47.604
"This guy teaches about business?
We went to Harvard University." Whatever.

12:47.684 --> 12:52.489
Well, I'm here to tell you,
I went to my own school,

12:52.564 --> 12:55.032
the school of the hard knocks.

12:56.527 --> 12:59.207
I also took some
classes at DeVry once.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.786
Mostly web design.

13:00.864 --> 13:05.040
But then some stuff came up.
You know, some personal stuff.

13:12.626 --> 13:13.883
Am I interrupting you?

13:13.961 --> 13:16.297
No. No.

13:16.380 --> 13:17.673
Can I see that, please?

13:17.756 --> 13:21.517
Yeah, I... It's not something...
It's not... I just...

13:25.264 --> 13:26.651
Sorry about that.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.942
You must have big
rocks between your legs.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.857
I... No.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.656
You think you can stare
me down, boy?

13:32.729 --> 13:34.735
Stare you down?

13:34.815 --> 13:38.029
No, I mean, you're just talking.
I'm just listening.

13:38.110 --> 13:38.928
Shh!

13:38.955 --> 13:42.228
And I was... Okay. I'm
not staring you down.

13:43.824 --> 13:44.916
Strike one.

13:46.285 --> 13:47.542
Oh, shit.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.419
I'm a military man.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.585
Navy SEAL, Special Forces,
you name it.

13:52.666 --> 13:55.086
I've seen men die.

13:55.169 --> 13:56.675
I've made men cry.

13:58.338 --> 14:03.688
I will offer you the most intense
wilderness experience allowed by law.

14:04.386 --> 14:07.269
We'll fly off to an island

14:07.347 --> 14:12.437
where it will be you
and me versus nature.

14:13.103 --> 14:16.401
I will teach you negotiation.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.401
Teamwork.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.030
Leadership.

14:22.738 --> 14:28.705
And if we're not too careful,
we may have a little fun.

14:31.288 --> 14:33.589
I will see you at 0600.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.006
Dismissed.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.127
Oh! Hang on.

14:36.210 --> 14:41.347
We're gonna have a little soiree in honour
of Phil and the Krayton deal at McCabe's.

14:41.423 --> 14:42.508
Drinks are on the company.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.138
- Great!
- Yes!

14:46.637 --> 14:48.108
I don't know.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.527
Teamwork.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.439
Mortal Kombat is more like it.

14:53.519 --> 14:55.855
Relax, Dale. It's just a silly
team-building exercise.

14:55.938 --> 14:59.034
Word has it, there are some major
cutbacks coming down the pike.

14:59.107 --> 15:02.453
How you perform on this trip determines
your future with this company.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.197
If I were you,
I'd really watch out.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.217
Trying to steal Phil's
thunder and all.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.916
Yeah, all right, Dale.
We're just trying to have a good time.

15:10.369 --> 15:11.875
I'm having a good time.

15:14.623 --> 15:17.257
I wouldn't count on
these drinks being for free.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.717
That is a dark human being.

15:19.795 --> 15:22.642
Just one more, and then cut
me off, please. Thank you.

15:23.549 --> 15:24.723
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.307
You ready for this big nature trip?

15:26.385 --> 15:29.731
Oh, I am shitting
myself in anticipation.

15:30.264 --> 15:33.645
I'm not much of a camper,
but it could be fun, right?

15:33.725 --> 15:37.736
I'm not much of a camper either.
But luckily for us, Chris is.

15:37.813 --> 15:39.782
In fact, this man was an Eagle
Scout when he was, like, 25.

15:39.857 --> 15:42.193
That's not true. I was 19.
Then I cut it off.

15:42.276 --> 15:44.245
They even made him a scoutmaster.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.656
And he was taking boys out
in the woods and stuff.

15:46.738 --> 15:47.866
Well, it's really... I'd sound so...

15:47.948 --> 15:50.035
- I'd stop talking about it.
- Why don't you stop the humility act?

15:50.117 --> 15:51.623
'Cause he also won
the Silver Badger,

15:51.702 --> 15:53.873
which is, like, the highest award
that the Boy Scouts give out.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.377
- So, we're in good hands.
- Beaver. It's the Beaver.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.962
Cool. Excuse me?

15:58.959 --> 16:02.091
It's the Silver Beaver.
Minor distinction.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.808
Silver Beaver?

16:04.882 --> 16:06.435
That's a terrible name.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.311
I'm sorry.

16:08.385 --> 16:10.846
If I knew that was the name,
I would not have brought it up.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.183
Thanks so much.

16:14.516 --> 16:17.695
Well, it'll be really good to have
you out there, Silver Beaver.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.492
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.784
I can't believe I have to spend a weekend
on an island with Phil.

16:29.865 --> 16:33.211
You gotta relax, man.
Guy's not worth it.

16:33.285 --> 16:35.539
Don't do that. I don't wanna
show up smelling like pot.

16:35.621 --> 16:38.420
Well, you shouldn't have
picked me up, then.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.384
You know he spends 200 bucks
a month on Internet porn?

16:42.461 --> 16:45.973
And it's all Filipino
anal brutality.

16:46.048 --> 16:49.145
- How do you know that?
- I can access everyone's email account.

16:50.302 --> 16:51.856
What am I supposed to do,
not read it?

16:52.763 --> 16:53.890
No.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.609
Come on. Let's go. We're late.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.450
Come on! Let's move, people!

17:16.328 --> 17:18.499
This is a cargo plane.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.751
- Yup.
- I'm not getting on that.

17:21.625 --> 17:24.839
Come on, guys.
You can't live forever.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.842
I agree with you, Lisa.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.195
Jesus. Get a load of the pilot.

17:48.443 --> 17:51.243
We're all gonna die.

18:10.174 --> 18:11.645
You Okay?

18:13.844 --> 18:15.730
It's gonna be good.
We're gonna be all right.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.913
The bird has landed.

18:38.744 --> 18:41.164
Welcome to Big Mama Nature's house.

18:41.246 --> 18:44.592
It's just us and the jungle now.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.929
- It's so humid. I'm pitting out.
- Where are we?

18:48.003 --> 18:49.344
I have no idea.

18:49.421 --> 18:54.427
Hey, just remember
I'm in charge here.

18:54.510 --> 18:57.440
- I think we got off on the wrong foot.
- Is that...

19:01.266 --> 19:03.817
Am I smelling marijuana?

19:03.894 --> 19:06.279
No.

19:06.355 --> 19:08.490
You've been night-riding
on my watch, boy?

19:08.565 --> 19:10.736
Night-riding? No, sir. No, sir.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.202
Is that your goal in life?
To get on top of my shit list?

19:13.278 --> 19:17.750
Mr Storm, I swear I was not
night-riding. I wouldn't do that.

19:18.867 --> 19:22.794
Watch yourself, Kumar,
because I've got my eye on you.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.457
Okay.

19:28.544 --> 19:32.138
Sorry, amigo.
But this is so much better stoned.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.768
You're a dick.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.473
Psst!

19:35.676 --> 19:37.562
Psst! Chris! Come here.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.859
Come here, I gotta talk to you.

19:41.682 --> 19:42.773
- Hey!
- What?

19:42.850 --> 19:44.273
- I need your help. Come here.
- What are you doing?

19:44.351 --> 19:46.605
Dude, I know you're pissed at me,
but we need to work as a team.

19:46.687 --> 19:48.277
I need your binoculars.

19:49.273 --> 19:50.945
Get down. Get down.

19:51.024 --> 19:54.073
This is important.
This is a business meeting.

19:54.152 --> 19:58.744
Oh, my God.
Look at Traci's breasts.

19:58.824 --> 20:00.663
I mean, is she pregnant, or what?
Those are huge.

20:00.742 --> 20:01.863
Just give me the binoculars.

20:01.869 --> 20:05.083
Chris, please, okay? These are our
co-workers. We deserve this.

20:05.914 --> 20:08.085
Oh, yes, Ashley.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.847
Yeah, feel those things.

20:10.919 --> 20:13.090
There's a mammogram
going on over there.

20:13.172 --> 20:14.178
You know, I'm not
comfortable lurking here.

20:14.205 --> 20:14.455
Shh!

20:14.506 --> 20:15.977
- Those are my binoculars.
- I'm not comfortable either.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.390
What if one of us pops a boner?

20:18.218 --> 20:20.899
Oh! And look who it is now.

20:20.971 --> 20:25.527
It's little Jenny Wong, the Kung Fu
Panda, 'cause she's Asian.

20:25.601 --> 20:28.069
- That's so racist.
- You know, just once,

20:28.145 --> 20:30.648
I would like to eat a fortune cookie
out of Jenny Wong's butthole.

20:30.731 --> 20:32.119
Jesus! Out of her butthole?

20:32.191 --> 20:34.492
It's not sanitary, but it'd
be a hell of a good time.

20:34.568 --> 20:35.612
That's debatable.

20:35.694 --> 20:36.868
Oh, boy.

20:36.945 --> 20:40.789
And here comes the biggest slut of 'em
all. Here comes Lisa.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.752
I don't know if you noticed on the plane.
We had a little moment.

20:43.827 --> 20:45.038
- Okay, I'll take them. Let me take them.
- Chris!

20:45.120 --> 20:47.006
- Give them back to me, Chris.
- You're not gonna look.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.280
Chris, they're...
I just wanna borrow 'em.

20:48.307 --> 20:48.827
No! Let me...

20:48.832 --> 20:50.043
Just for a...

20:53.253 --> 20:54.677
Hey, Chris.

20:55.964 --> 20:57.601
Hey, guys.

20:58.634 --> 21:00.021
What are you doing back there?

21:01.136 --> 21:02.524
I just saw a blue-crowned motmot.

21:02.596 --> 21:04.850
- Gonna take a closer look.
- A what?

21:04.932 --> 21:08.230
It's a bird. Rare one.
Really very, very cool stuff.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.397
Oh, hey, it looks like
we're heading out.

21:12.147 --> 21:14.651
Yeah. What a psycho.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.227
Don't push me, man. Don't
fucking push me. Don't push me.

21:58.402 --> 22:00.039
Well, I guess chivalry's dead!

22:00.112 --> 22:02.496
I thought we weren't speaking.
I can't carry your bag, then.

22:02.573 --> 22:04.774
- We are not speaking!
- Oh, then what are we doing now?

22:04.825 --> 22:06.664
Oh, what are we doing now?

22:06.743 --> 22:08.665
That's how I talk?
That's how I talk?

22:13.333 --> 22:16.548
My friends,
welcome to our new home.

22:16.628 --> 22:19.179
- Ah! It's beautiful.
- It's all right.

22:20.841 --> 22:23.142
This might not be so bad, huh?

22:26.388 --> 22:28.274
Look at this place!

22:31.768 --> 22:33.690
I'm holding the talking stick.

22:38.233 --> 22:39.407
Talking stick attack?

22:39.484 --> 22:40.872
I'm watching you, huh?

22:42.529 --> 22:45.827
Being here reminds
me of a famous story

22:45.908 --> 22:50.000
about some young boys
being stuck in an island.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.166
Before long, they turn into animals.

22:52.956 --> 22:57.263
And from there,
everything goes straight to hell.

22:57.336 --> 23:00.764
And do you know
which story I'm talking about?

23:00.839 --> 23:03.094
Right, right, right.

23:03.175 --> 23:04.349
<i>Pinocchio.</i>

23:04.426 --> 23:08.104
And the island was Pleasure Island.

23:09.014 --> 23:12.478
They spend all day
eating candy, playing pool.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.814
And they turn into donkeys.

23:15.395 --> 23:16.986
And then I don't remember.

23:17.064 --> 23:20.278
I haven't seen it for a long time.

23:20.359 --> 23:21.652
The whale was involved.

23:22.694 --> 23:26.574
Anyway, this will not
be happening here.

23:27.282 --> 23:30.212
The next two days,
you will be pushed to your limit!

23:31.453 --> 23:35.795
Are you ready
to look at the devil in the eyes?

23:37.543 --> 23:38.634
Good.

23:39.878 --> 23:41.468
Good night.

23:42.631 --> 23:44.138
I hold the stick.

23:44.216 --> 23:46.802
I hold the talking stick.

23:53.559 --> 23:59.407
We are going to let out the primal
scream to unleash the warrior inside us.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.237
Miss Brenda.

24:06.321 --> 24:07.709
Good.

24:09.449 --> 24:10.541
Not bad.

24:14.204 --> 24:15.378
You have issues.

24:15.455 --> 24:16.630
Chris.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.057
Hey, come here.

24:24.339 --> 24:25.632
I'm not really a screamer.

24:25.716 --> 24:30.022
Scream like I'm squeezing
into your balls.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.850
- You're laughing at me, boy?
- No.

24:37.269 --> 24:41.778
Scream like I am squeezing
into your balls!

24:46.236 --> 24:47.410
- Better?
Disappointing.

24:47.487 --> 24:48.531
Go!

24:48.614 --> 24:49.705
Next.

24:55.704 --> 25:00.260
My father used to make pancakes in the
morning, but I was not allowed to eat any!

25:00.334 --> 25:03.217
Why?

25:03.337 --> 25:08.141
Not every Asian kid needs to learn
how to play the violin, Mom!

25:08.217 --> 25:12.227
I wanted to learn how
to play baseball!

25:17.893 --> 25:19.732
Troy. Excellent.

25:20.562 --> 25:21.606
Excellent.

25:25.275 --> 25:29.286
You must trust your partner
to get you safely through the trees,

25:29.363 --> 25:33.325
and you must trust yourself
to guide your partner.

25:33.408 --> 25:35.912
Yeah, shouldn't one of us
not be blindfolded?

25:42.417 --> 25:45.098
- That's my hat, sir.
- It's my hat now.

25:45.170 --> 25:46.262
What?

25:46.338 --> 25:47.382
Go!

25:47.464 --> 25:49.967
Hold on. I can't see anything!

25:54.304 --> 25:55.515
Tree.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.982
- Troy, you're slowing us down!
- Sorry!

26:00.853 --> 26:04.316
- This is a lawsuit, man!
- Tell that to the tiger!

26:07.442 --> 26:08.653
Oh, my God!

26:08.944 --> 26:10.285
Oh, my God!

26:13.866 --> 26:16.286
Guys, you guys, you guys,
there's no tiger.

26:16.994 --> 26:21.004
Guys, there's no tiger!
There's no tiger. False alarm.

26:21.081 --> 26:22.374
It's BS.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.379
Stop freaking out...

26:24.459 --> 26:26.630
Oh, my God!
Did that lunatic set explosives?

26:28.213 --> 26:31.511
I'd say that's a yes. Move!
Move, man, move!

26:37.973 --> 26:40.108
Inside, outside, inside outside.

26:41.393 --> 26:42.485
Come on, people!

26:42.561 --> 26:45.029
It's not a game! It's a war!

26:49.443 --> 26:51.080
We have a winner.

27:43.330 --> 27:44.504
Oh!

27:44.581 --> 27:45.874
Oh. my God!

27:45.958 --> 27:48.841
I'm so sorry. I didn't see
you lying there like that.

27:48.919 --> 27:50.426
On the ground.

27:51.255 --> 27:53.509
Completely motionless.

27:55.551 --> 27:57.556
Quite possibly dead.

28:01.139 --> 28:04.354
- Chris, are you sure he's dead?
- Very dead. That much I'm sure.

28:04.434 --> 28:05.692
How the fuck are we
gonna get out of here?

28:05.769 --> 28:07.240
People, people, please.

28:07.312 --> 28:09.152
Let's don't lose our mind.

28:09.231 --> 28:11.817
How are we gonna get home, Storm?
Our pilot's dead.

28:12.401 --> 28:14.904
Worst come to worst,
I will fly you out of here.

28:14.987 --> 28:16.374
You know how to fly?

28:16.446 --> 28:17.574
Please.

28:17.656 --> 28:19.910
Storm, I swear to God
I saw a fricking tiger.

28:19.992 --> 28:21.083
- What?
- What?

28:21.159 --> 28:22.417
- Tiger.
- Yeah.

28:22.494 --> 28:23.538
I saw it, too.

28:23.620 --> 28:26.088
It was, like, 10 feet from Dale's
tent. It ran towards the cliff.

28:26.164 --> 28:27.671
Guys, guys, guys.

28:27.749 --> 28:30.679
- Storm...
- Don't let your imagination run wild.

28:31.420 --> 28:35.430
But just to make you feel better,
let's go to see that tiger.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.344
Why are we going to look at the tiger?
Let's go the other way.

28:39.386 --> 28:41.142
It makes zero sense.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.028
You see?

28:51.190 --> 28:52.827
There is no tiger.

28:53.775 --> 28:57.536
What are the chances of
a dangerous animal in this island?

28:58.488 --> 29:00.042
Zero. Okay?

29:02.409 --> 29:04.046
So just calm...

29:07.289 --> 29:09.590
Holy shit!

29:14.713 --> 29:15.887
Nobody move.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.563
- No, no, no, no.
- The beast is a gentle spirit.

29:21.512 --> 29:22.852
He's scared.

29:23.138 --> 29:25.938
Be not afraid,
my noble jungle brother.

29:26.850 --> 29:29.235
Your brother means no harm.

29:31.230 --> 29:32.273
Help!

29:32.356 --> 29:33.744
Quickly!

29:33.815 --> 29:36.200
Stick a finger into
the tiger's anus.

29:36.276 --> 29:39.206
- What?
- Stick your finger into the tiger's anus!

29:39.279 --> 29:41.907
Why in the hell would he want us to
put a finger in his asshole?

29:41.949 --> 29:43.705
It's how you subdue
an attacking dog!

29:44.701 --> 29:46.160
Troy, that's you.
Get in there and do that.

29:46.187 --> 29:47.022
No, I don't want to!

29:47.037 --> 29:48.793
- Troy, you have to!
- I don't wanna do it!

29:56.880 --> 29:58.221
It's okay, everyone.

29:58.757 --> 29:59.801
It's over.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.267
He won't come back.

30:05.305 --> 30:06.349
Whoa!

30:36.128 --> 30:37.220
First, the pilot dies.

30:37.296 --> 30:39.135
- Then the European dude dies.
- No one's looking for us.

30:39.214 --> 30:40.258
We're gonna die, then.

30:40.340 --> 30:42.511
We're stuck with no way off.

30:42.593 --> 30:44.432
- We're stuck with no way off.
- I know that!

30:44.511 --> 30:47.545
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be fine, hon.

30:48.432 --> 30:51.018
- You think so?
- Do I think so?

30:51.852 --> 30:54.071
Does Bugs Bunny like carrots?

30:54.396 --> 30:55.950
Yeah.

30:56.023 --> 30:59.736
He likes 'em a lot.
Likes 'em a lot.

31:00.152 --> 31:03.028
I think if you just
move past this fear...

31:03.055 --> 31:03.772
Right?

31:03.822 --> 31:05.708
- ...you can reach inside you.
- Yeah.

31:05.782 --> 31:07.170
Find what it takes
to get out of here.

31:07.242 --> 31:08.286
How's everybody doing?

31:08.368 --> 31:12.379
- Oh, we're great, Phil, thanks.
- Yeah. We're fine, Phil.

31:12.915 --> 31:15.169
Lisa, can I talk to you for
a second, in private?

31:16.752 --> 31:18.305
Just really need to talk.

31:18.378 --> 31:20.265
All right.

31:20.339 --> 31:24.182
- You gonna make it, hon?
- Oh, yeah. Thank you so much, Lisa.

31:24.259 --> 31:26.561
- What's up?
- Let's go over here.

31:27.513 --> 31:29.600
She's real fucked up, huh?

31:29.681 --> 31:31.105
Have a seat.

31:32.267 --> 31:34.154
What's going on, Phil?

31:35.187 --> 31:37.274
How are you holding up?

31:37.356 --> 31:39.491
Great.
Thanks for asking, Phil.

31:39.566 --> 31:41.073
Did you bring a bathing suit?

31:41.860 --> 31:42.952
Yeah.

31:43.028 --> 31:44.748
You go bikini, or...

31:44.821 --> 31:47.954
Doesn't matter. We're not gonna
swim leisurely right now.

31:48.033 --> 31:50.619
No. Yeah.
I mean, it's not a vacation.

31:51.662 --> 31:53.797
What do you need?

31:53.872 --> 31:57.218
Well, I was thinking, you know,

31:57.292 --> 32:01.801
every woman, no matter how
strong she thinks she is,

32:01.880 --> 32:03.683
she wants some comfort
from a man.

32:05.092 --> 32:08.271
And, Lisa, I thought I could
be that man for you.

32:09.304 --> 32:11.392
Because here's the thing.

32:12.808 --> 32:14.149
- Lisa...
- Mmm-hmm.

32:15.352 --> 32:16.396
I've fallen for you.

32:17.479 --> 32:18.867
- Okay.
- I've fallen real hard.

32:18.939 --> 32:20.362
Okay! Phil!

32:20.440 --> 32:22.659
You realise we're in a
crisis right now, right?

32:22.734 --> 32:27.409
Skeeze out on your own time, man. There's
something seriously wrong with you.

32:27.990 --> 32:30.624
You don't have to be
a bitch about it.

32:36.999 --> 32:40.511
No dice. It's busted. Old timer
probably wasn't even using it.

32:40.586 --> 32:42.840
- Damn it! Are you sure?
- Yeah.

32:42.921 --> 32:45.009
I used to do ham radio
on the weekends with my dad.

32:45.090 --> 32:47.178
It was like child abuse
without the touching.

32:47.259 --> 32:48.303
Oh, my God.

32:50.179 --> 32:52.563
I'm sure somebody's coming for us.

32:52.639 --> 32:56.352
Nobody knows where we are,
and there's a tiger killing people!

32:56.435 --> 32:58.191
And there could be more tigers!

32:58.270 --> 33:03.739
And who knows who they're gonna kill
next? It could be you, or you, or you!

33:03.817 --> 33:04.909
Any one of us!

33:04.985 --> 33:08.331
You guys, no one knows we're here!

33:08.405 --> 33:12.036
We are totally fucked!
We are fucked!

33:12.117 --> 33:15.083
He's right. He's right, you guys.
We're gonna die!

33:20.000 --> 33:21.803
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down, you guys.

33:21.877 --> 33:23.799
Come on. Come on.
We gotta stay calm.

33:24.588 --> 33:28.301
But there is one person that can
keep us safe, and that's me.

33:28.759 --> 33:32.721
Now, as the highest ranking executive
from the Crawford Design Group,

33:32.804 --> 33:35.106
I am now officially in charge.

33:35.182 --> 33:38.528
So, if you all do exactly as I say...

33:38.602 --> 33:39.646
What happened?

33:39.728 --> 33:41.318
She got bit by a snake!

33:41.396 --> 33:43.781
- Go get my machete.
- Brenda, let me see.

33:43.857 --> 33:46.740
- Man, it hurts! It hurts!
- Okay. I know. Let me see. Ow!

33:47.611 --> 33:49.283
Okay, everybody, get back.
This isn't gonna be pretty.

33:49.363 --> 33:50.406
Do it, Troy, right at the knee.

33:50.489 --> 33:51.616
- What?
- No.

33:51.698 --> 33:53.538
- Me?
- Yes, you! Do it now!

33:54.826 --> 33:58.041
No! Hey! Hang on!
Nobody's cutting anyone's leg off.

33:58.121 --> 33:59.682
Listen, Brenda,
just take a deep breath,

33:59.748 --> 34:02.133
and describe to me
exactly what the snake looked like.

34:02.209 --> 34:05.507
It was big, and it had black
swirls and dots on it.

34:05.587 --> 34:07.639
You're wasting time.
The venom's spreading.

34:07.714 --> 34:08.925
Do it now!

34:09.007 --> 34:10.679
Hey! Wait, no, listen.

34:10.759 --> 34:12.978
She's describing a <i>Python regius.</i>
It's not poisonous.

34:13.053 --> 34:14.097
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

34:14.179 --> 34:16.943
- I saw one of those on the way in here.
- Thank God.

34:17.014 --> 34:18.188
It really hurts!

34:18.266 --> 34:19.868
All right, well, then,
I'm gonna piss on it.

34:19.895 --> 34:21.176
It's the only way
to help the pain.

34:21.228 --> 34:24.989
Whoa, whoa, no. That's for a
jellyfish sting. Knock it off.

34:25.065 --> 34:26.951
I got Storm's first aid kit.

34:27.025 --> 34:30.322
- Okay. Okay, what have we got?
- It's all just Dave Matthews bootlegs.

34:30.404 --> 34:33.417
Okay, we're gonna improvise.

34:33.489 --> 34:34.748
I'm really happy to
piss on it, Brenda.

34:34.824 --> 34:36.664
No, Phil.

34:38.245 --> 34:39.668
Okay.

34:39.746 --> 34:40.920
What is that?

34:41.831 --> 34:44.217
It's woundwort. It should
help with the pain a bit.

34:44.293 --> 34:46.594
Yeah, that's gross, Chris.
And it's not gonna work.

34:46.670 --> 34:48.011
It's working. It feels better.

34:48.088 --> 34:51.552
Good. Good. It should prevent
any infection. You'll heal soon.

34:51.632 --> 34:54.563
- You wanna try and stand?
- Come on.

34:54.636 --> 34:55.810
Okay, I'm impressed.

34:55.888 --> 34:59.649
Okay. Okay. You're gonna be okay.

34:59.725 --> 35:00.852
Thank you.

35:00.934 --> 35:02.655
Did you learn that in the Scouts?

35:02.728 --> 35:04.021
You know, I picked
up a thing or two.

35:04.104 --> 35:06.572
Can you teach us
how to do that kind of stuff?

35:06.648 --> 35:09.366
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Okay.
But, listen, you guys,

35:09.443 --> 35:12.652
the first rule of survival is,
no matter what the situation,

35:12.679 --> 35:13.941
you cannot panic, okay?

35:13.989 --> 35:15.330
Maybe you should be in charge, then.

35:15.407 --> 35:17.412
Hey, wait a second.
Let's not go crazy.

35:17.492 --> 35:19.276
Yeah, I don't... We
don't have to have...

35:19.303 --> 35:19.939
No, no, no.

35:19.995 --> 35:22.759
Who here thinks Chris
should be in charge?

35:22.831 --> 35:25.399
Okay, who thinks Phil
should be in charge?

35:25.426 --> 35:26.321
Here we go.

35:26.376 --> 35:28.132
Chris, Chris...

35:28.212 --> 35:29.469
Chris. Chris.

35:29.546 --> 35:31.183
Chris. Chris. Chris.

35:31.256 --> 35:33.427
Okay. Okay. Okay. I...

35:33.509 --> 35:35.015
Chris. Chris. Chris.

35:35.093 --> 35:37.562
- Are you sure? Are you sure about this?
- Absolutely.

35:42.309 --> 35:45.406
All right. I got a few ideas.
Uh, yeah.

35:45.896 --> 35:47.403
Yeah, I think this could work.

36:17.302 --> 36:18.476
That's it. Keep feeding that fire.

36:18.554 --> 36:20.808
Gotta get a thick, black
smoke going for the signal.

36:20.889 --> 36:22.977
Yo, yo, Chris.
Can I talk to you for a second?

36:23.058 --> 36:24.565
Sure, Phil. What's up?

36:25.477 --> 36:28.111
Are you sure you're up for
this being in charge business?

36:29.231 --> 36:30.358
I think so. Why?

36:30.941 --> 36:32.827
You think so.

36:32.901 --> 36:35.701
Well, being a leader is tough.
You've seen me at the office.

36:35.779 --> 36:37.416
You know how that can get.

36:37.489 --> 36:39.790
Frankly, I'm not sure
you can handle it.

36:39.867 --> 36:41.954
What are you talking about?

36:42.244 --> 36:45.209
Come on, man.
Like it isn't totally obvious?

36:45.289 --> 36:50.010
Eventually, someone's gonna have to
decide which of us gets eaten first.

36:50.085 --> 36:51.177
What?

36:51.253 --> 36:53.009
Javier is the fattest.

36:53.422 --> 36:55.261
So he deserves to die.

36:55.340 --> 36:57.511
I'm sorry if that's not PC.

36:57.593 --> 37:00.096
Phil, we have enough nuts
stored up to feed an army.

37:00.179 --> 37:01.769
I don't like nuts!

37:02.973 --> 37:05.274
- And Javier would feed a lot of people.
- All right.

37:05.350 --> 37:07.511
Phil, can you knock it off, please?
Chris is in charge.

37:07.561 --> 37:09.151
We're all on board
with this, right?

37:09.229 --> 37:11.400
- Yes.
- Yeah, I think we're good, Phil.

37:12.191 --> 37:13.282
Fine.

37:14.484 --> 37:16.703
You wanna follow Pocahontas?

37:16.778 --> 37:18.332
Don't blame me.

37:19.364 --> 37:20.954
What's up, Javier?

37:21.033 --> 37:22.374
Hey.

37:22.451 --> 37:24.171
All right, people.

37:24.244 --> 37:26.925
Let's get back to work.
We've got a big day ahead of us.

37:47.684 --> 37:49.986
What happened to everybody?
They were all doing so well.

37:50.062 --> 37:52.363
I don't know. It's just like
at the office, you know?

37:52.439 --> 37:54.983
They're good to work for a little
while, then it's nappy time.

37:56.777 --> 37:58.248
- Javier?
- Javi?

37:58.320 --> 37:59.957
Hey, buddy.

38:00.030 --> 38:02.157
Weren't you supposed to
be on food gathering detail?

38:02.449 --> 38:05.628
Oh, go away. Sleepy.

38:07.329 --> 38:11.968
Okay, everybody. We really gotta
kick it into high gear. Ugh!

38:12.042 --> 38:13.928
Come on, guys!

38:14.002 --> 38:15.924
I don't know how many
times I have to say this.

38:16.004 --> 38:17.139
When you go number two,

38:17.166 --> 38:20.372
you've gotta go at least 50 yards
from the campsite, all right?

38:20.425 --> 38:23.059
I'm not trying to be a buzzkill,
but it's a major health hazard.

38:23.136 --> 38:26.150
Hey, man. Nobody's on food detail,
and whoever's on tiger watch took off.

38:26.223 --> 38:27.808
You gotta step up and
take charge, man.

38:27.850 --> 38:29.273
These people are just gonna
keep slap-dicking around.

38:29.351 --> 38:30.822
Okay. Okay, Jared.
I'm on it.

38:30.894 --> 38:32.187
- All right, buddy. Let's go.
- Okay.

38:32.271 --> 38:35.319
Hey, everybody!
Look over here.

38:36.692 --> 38:40.120
Thought you'd all want something
to eat besides nuts.

38:40.195 --> 38:42.580
- Behold!
- We bring meat!

38:45.158 --> 38:46.250
Ugh!

38:46.326 --> 38:48.047
I killed it with my own bare hands.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.508
- Isn't that right, Troy?
- Yes!

38:49.580 --> 38:50.671
Meat!

38:50.747 --> 38:52.966
That looks like it's been
dead at least two weeks.

38:53.041 --> 38:54.429
And that's not all.

38:57.004 --> 39:00.551
Oh, no. Is that coffee?

39:00.632 --> 39:03.017
- You bet your fat ass it is.
- Hey!

39:03.093 --> 39:06.640
I found the plants just over that ridge.
There's enough for all of us.

39:06.722 --> 39:08.941
Oh, God. Tastes so good.

39:09.016 --> 39:11.863
Okay, okay, you guys.
I don't know about the coffee yet,

39:11.935 --> 39:15.317
but I can tell you for sure that
that meat is not safe to consume.

39:15.397 --> 39:17.782
I'm afraid that's not
your decision, Chris.

39:17.858 --> 39:21.452
And I invite all of you to
share in my bounty.

39:23.488 --> 39:25.707
- Oh, God. That looks so delicious.
- I wouldn't do it. I strongly...

39:25.782 --> 39:26.957
Luther. Hey, Dale. Don't.
The meat's no good.

39:27.034 --> 39:29.620
- Ashley.
- I advise against this.

39:31.914 --> 39:32.957
Yeah!

39:33.749 --> 39:39.348
He put up a real fight, but I snuck
up behind him and snapped his neck.

39:41.256 --> 39:42.893
It's the least I could do.

39:42.966 --> 39:45.185
- We're a family now.
- Yeah. We are.

39:45.260 --> 39:46.553
Right, man.

39:55.938 --> 39:59.070
- Try it.
- No, thanks. I'm good. Thank you.

39:59.149 --> 40:02.135
Look, I understand
that we're not at the

40:02.163 --> 40:05.439
office and everyone's
under a lot of stress.

40:05.489 --> 40:07.893
But I just feel that
some of the language

40:07.920 --> 40:10.439
that I've been hearing
tossed around lately

40:10.494 --> 40:12.380
is offensive to some people.

40:13.121 --> 40:14.961
I've heard MFer.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.092
I've heard CSer.

40:17.167 --> 40:21.889
I've heard A-hole,
BJ, F this F-ing S.

40:21.964 --> 40:24.099
Check out that B's T's.

40:24.174 --> 40:28.018
Slip it in her C-hole.
F it in the fudge shop.

40:28.095 --> 40:31.891
S on that donkey D,
you dirty F-ing S-bag,

40:31.974 --> 40:35.900
then L up that V-juice
and spit it in my A.

40:35.978 --> 40:40.450
Then H it till it's sore
with your S-covered P-pounder.

40:40.524 --> 40:42.031
Also I've heard...

40:42.109 --> 40:43.948
Who gives a shit?

40:44.027 --> 40:46.079
Hey, it's Brenda's turn to speak.
She can say whatever she wants.

40:46.154 --> 40:48.919
You know the rules.
I have the talking stick.

40:51.159 --> 40:53.165
Screw the rules!

40:53.245 --> 40:54.716
Phil, enough.

40:55.163 --> 40:57.584
Yeah, Brenda.
Screw your rules!

40:57.666 --> 41:00.003
I'm holding the talking stick.

41:00.085 --> 41:04.557
Stick means nothing!

41:05.132 --> 41:06.935
Come on. Sit down.

41:08.844 --> 41:09.888
No.

41:10.762 --> 41:12.150
I won't sit down.

41:12.848 --> 41:18.696
Because I am so sick of your rules!

41:19.354 --> 41:20.695
So's everybody else.

41:20.772 --> 41:24.071
Come on, Dale. Stand up.
Come on, you guys.

41:24.151 --> 41:26.535
Why should we listen to you?

41:26.612 --> 41:28.617
- Everybody knows...
- Stand up.

41:28.697 --> 41:30.536
I should be leader.

41:31.617 --> 41:34.547
This isn't helping, Phil. Okay?
Come on. We're all in this together.

41:35.871 --> 41:39.964
You just wanna be able to
tell everybody what to do.

41:40.042 --> 41:42.628
"Watch the signal fire.

41:42.711 --> 41:44.182
"Let's ration the food!

41:45.506 --> 41:47.974
"Don't shit in other people's tents"?

41:48.050 --> 41:49.473
- That's obvious.
- Yeah.

41:49.551 --> 41:52.185
- I'll shit where I want.
- Damn right, Troy.

41:52.262 --> 41:54.014
Look at Chris, everyone.

41:55.599 --> 41:59.822
How can he protect you
from the dangers of the jungle

41:59.895 --> 42:02.612
when he won't even
stand up to me now?

42:02.689 --> 42:04.113
Will you?

42:04.650 --> 42:06.037
Huh?

42:06.318 --> 42:08.038
Will you, Chris?

42:08.111 --> 42:10.745
In front of all these people?

42:10.822 --> 42:12.210
You gonna stand up to me?

42:12.282 --> 42:15.746
- You never have before.
- Phil, I'm not gonna fight you.

42:15.827 --> 42:17.915
Order! The stick!

42:18.038 --> 42:20.398
No, he's not gonna do anything
in front of all these people.

42:20.415 --> 42:21.887
What is wrong with you? Stop!

42:21.959 --> 42:23.465
Come on, guys. Order.

42:23.544 --> 42:24.635
He's not a leader.

42:24.711 --> 42:26.004
He's a follower.

42:26.088 --> 42:27.476
So get out of my way!

42:27.548 --> 42:28.805
Come on, Phil.

42:31.134 --> 42:34.267
Who would deny me,
the one who has brought you meat?

42:34.346 --> 42:35.983
Order!

42:36.056 --> 42:37.693
Order!

42:38.559 --> 42:39.899
Chaos!

43:13.552 --> 43:15.937
Troy put this in the coffee.

43:18.390 --> 43:20.229
This is Jimsonweed.

43:20.309 --> 43:21.946
It's hallucinogenic.

43:22.853 --> 43:24.609
Oh, this is bad.

44:42.724 --> 44:44.776
That was some party.

44:44.852 --> 44:46.607
I gotta say, Troy,
I've never seen your penis before.

44:46.687 --> 44:48.359
- You've got a nice one.
- Thanks.

44:48.438 --> 44:50.325
The signal fire's out.

44:50.649 --> 44:51.693
So?

44:52.568 --> 44:54.240
That's our only chance
of getting off this island.

44:54.319 --> 44:57.249
What if a boat or a plane came by?
We can't be stupid right now.

44:58.574 --> 45:02.085
Chris, I would watch your
tone with me. I'm the chief.

45:02.160 --> 45:04.204
Yeah, I'm sure
you're gonna make some great chief,

45:04.246 --> 45:06.686
just eating, laying around all day,
having orgies every night.

45:06.707 --> 45:07.798
Hey, that's not fair.

45:07.875 --> 45:09.262
No? Well, what are you
gonna do tonight?

45:09.334 --> 45:11.636
I don't know. Probably
have another orgy.

45:11.712 --> 45:12.803
Okay. This is ridiculous.

45:12.880 --> 45:16.226
You guys, we are never gonna
get off the island like this, okay?

45:16.300 --> 45:17.972
We're behaving like children.

45:18.051 --> 45:20.021
Hey!

45:20.095 --> 45:23.477
You don't like the way we do things,
go start your own tribe, then.

45:25.267 --> 45:26.359
Fine.

45:26.435 --> 45:28.855
Fine, Phil, I will. I'm gonna hike
to the other side of the island.

45:28.937 --> 45:30.195
See what's over there.
You know what?

45:30.272 --> 45:32.131
Anyone who wants to
get serious about

45:32.158 --> 45:34.260
getting off this island,
you come with me.

45:34.318 --> 45:35.409
And the rest of you,

45:35.485 --> 45:41.002
you can just keep eating and drinking,
just having unprotected sex all the time.

45:41.074 --> 45:42.166
Okay.

45:42.242 --> 45:45.790
I don't think he gave the greatest pitch
in the world, but I'm with him.

45:45.871 --> 45:46.963
Thank you, brother.

45:47.039 --> 45:49.562
I'm also with Chris,
but I am not with Jared.

45:49.589 --> 45:50.411
Okay, okay.

45:50.459 --> 45:51.503
This is crazy.

45:51.585 --> 45:53.321
I think the only chance
we have of getting

45:53.348 --> 45:55.123
off this island is if
we all work together.

45:55.172 --> 45:58.387
Sol really think that maybe if we try
just a little active listening...

45:58.467 --> 46:00.519
Active listening?

46:01.094 --> 46:02.138
Lisa?

46:02.221 --> 46:04.107
Enough of your witchcraft!

46:05.307 --> 46:08.404
Phil, you are battling
some serious mental issues right now.

46:08.477 --> 46:11.989
Lisa, I think you're battling
some serious cock-teasing issues.

46:12.064 --> 46:13.617
- Ooh!
- That is harassment.

46:13.690 --> 46:15.909
I am reporting you as soon as
we get back to the office.

46:15.984 --> 46:17.242
- Okay.
- Go, then.

46:17.319 --> 46:21.281
All of you. Who needs you?
In fact, I command you to leave!

46:21.365 --> 46:22.788
Fine, Phil. Whatever.

46:22.866 --> 46:24.587
Good luck running things around here.
You're gonna need it.

46:24.660 --> 46:26.581
Be gone forever!

46:26.995 --> 46:30.590
And don't let me catch you
back on my side of the island!

46:31.166 --> 46:34.879
Unless you two girls wanna get
fucked, then hustle on back.

46:35.504 --> 46:36.845
All right, Troy.

46:36.922 --> 46:40.469
Hit me up with that fan, buddy.
Getting kind of hot.

47:12.165 --> 47:14.420
Orion's belt is
really bright tonight.

47:14.501 --> 47:16.102
What are you,
Daniel Boone, or something?

47:16.128 --> 47:17.220
No.

47:17.296 --> 47:19.467
I mean, no. You can navigate
the jungle, and...

47:19.548 --> 47:20.592
Yeah.

47:20.674 --> 47:24.268
And start this fire
by knocking two rocks together.

47:24.344 --> 47:26.480
You can identify
natural hallucinogens.

47:26.555 --> 47:30.067
Well, don't forget about my ability

47:30.142 --> 47:31.483
to make campfire cobbler.

47:32.769 --> 47:33.813
I love cobbler.

47:33.896 --> 47:35.283
I know. I know.

47:35.355 --> 47:37.360
I just picked a few berries

47:37.441 --> 47:41.071
and had some crackers,
threw in a little sugar, and voila.

47:41.153 --> 47:43.834
I know how you like sweets,
so, I just...

47:43.906 --> 47:45.911
You pay attention.

47:45.991 --> 47:47.414
I like that.

47:52.456 --> 47:54.591
- How is it? Is it too tart?
- Mmm!

47:57.461 --> 47:59.513
This is the best thing
I've eaten in days.

47:59.588 --> 48:00.632
Oh, good!

48:00.714 --> 48:03.187
My God! I am so
impressed, Silver Beaver.

48:03.214 --> 48:04.038
Thank you.

48:04.176 --> 48:08.056
I feel like I should give you

48:08.138 --> 48:10.274
a merit badge,
or something like that.

48:10.349 --> 48:13.446
Oh, that'd be nice. It'd look good
next to my hang gliding one.

48:14.102 --> 48:17.780
You have a merit
badge for hang gliding?

48:17.856 --> 48:21.736
It's tandem. I mean, I was tandem.
I was strapped to my scoutmaster.

48:21.860 --> 48:23.201
But, yeah.

48:23.445 --> 48:24.738
I do.

48:26.031 --> 48:28.535
I have never seen this side of you.

48:28.617 --> 48:30.254
How does someone
who's so adventurous

48:30.327 --> 48:33.709
end up designing toilet paper
packaging for a living?

48:36.208 --> 48:37.501
Yeah.

48:38.210 --> 48:40.547
Well, the truth is I...

48:40.629 --> 48:44.770
I always imagined my life being
a lot more interesting than it is.

48:44.842 --> 48:48.804
I went to work straight after school
like some trained robot.

48:50.013 --> 48:52.315
I just I feel like I
never even really lived.

48:52.891 --> 48:55.228
I feel the exact same way.

48:58.772 --> 49:02.485
I probably should've done something
about it a long time ago.

49:03.151 --> 49:06.414
It sounds like you need
to be a little bit more assertive.

49:07.030 --> 49:10.044
Assertiveness. Yes.

49:11.743 --> 49:14.840
I could see how that'd
be a good quality.

49:15.455 --> 49:17.342
I gotta take a shit.

49:17.416 --> 49:19.337
Hey, Brenda. Hey.

49:19.418 --> 49:21.387
What happened
to your clean language crusade?

49:21.503 --> 49:24.433
- I decided to fuck that to hell.
- Hmm.

49:24.506 --> 49:26.891
I don't have to poop,
I don't have a BM.

49:26.967 --> 49:31.309
What I have here is a shit. There
is no other word to describe this.

49:31.805 --> 49:33.442
And I've had it since
I got here, too.

49:33.515 --> 49:37.822
I've had to take a shit. But I thought
I could wait till I got home.

49:38.228 --> 49:40.150
- Can't hold it any more.
- Mmm-mmm.

49:40.272 --> 49:42.775
I am infected with shit right now.

49:43.442 --> 49:44.486
Yeah. Okay.

49:44.568 --> 49:46.739
I mean, I've never shat
in the woods before.

49:46.904 --> 49:48.031
Now's the time.

49:48.113 --> 49:51.162
Really? You don't think
anything is gonna bite my pussy?

49:51.325 --> 49:52.915
Nothing's gonna bite your pussy.

49:53.952 --> 49:56.882
Maybe I'll just hold it.
Hang out with you guys.

49:56.955 --> 49:58.960
No. You don't wanna
get attached to that.

49:59.041 --> 50:01.260
You wanna just cut your ties.

50:01.335 --> 50:03.304
Yep! You're right.

50:03.378 --> 50:06.261
I gotta go unleash
this shit in the wild.

50:06.632 --> 50:07.675
- Okay.
- Okay.

50:07.758 --> 50:10.937
That's good.
Just make it 50 yards, Bren.

50:12.346 --> 50:14.185
She's a sweet girl.

50:14.264 --> 50:15.818
I should probably go to bed.

50:16.850 --> 50:18.902
- Yeah, I guess. It might be time.
- Yeah.

50:19.228 --> 50:20.865
Yeah, big day tomorrow.

50:20.938 --> 50:22.195
We have lift-off!

50:23.023 --> 50:24.411
Jesus. Go further!

50:24.483 --> 50:25.954
Suck your mom's dick!

50:26.151 --> 50:27.658
They're great.

50:28.737 --> 50:30.707
They're a great couple.

50:31.615 --> 50:33.287
Anyways...

50:33.367 --> 50:35.170
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

50:36.995 --> 50:39.166
That wasn't her poo scream.

50:39.581 --> 50:41.171
- Brenda?
- Come on.

50:43.669 --> 50:46.468
- Look who it is.
- Oh, my God.

50:47.381 --> 50:49.516
- Are you okay?
- So-so.

50:49.967 --> 50:52.435
But thank you for asking.

50:52.886 --> 50:54.357
- Hey.
- What was that for?

50:54.429 --> 50:56.600
Just for getting us stranded
on the island. That's all.

50:56.682 --> 50:58.023
That's fair. That's fair.

50:58.100 --> 50:59.144
- Just one more.
- No, no, no.

50:59.226 --> 51:00.270
- Come on, guys.
- Okay.

51:00.352 --> 51:03.200
No more slapping.
You know?

51:03.272 --> 51:06.237
I'm badly wounded
by the tiger attack.

51:07.109 --> 51:08.236
I say we leave him.

51:08.318 --> 51:11.036
Yeah, why don't you let me
take a look at that?

51:11.196 --> 51:13.082
The beast got me good.

51:13.240 --> 51:15.292
Oh, geez.
That's already infected.

51:15.659 --> 51:18.542
Don't worry.
I've had worse.

51:18.620 --> 51:20.092
I survived three wars.

51:20.163 --> 51:21.255
Which three wars?

51:23.458 --> 51:25.795
Desert Storm, Desert Rain.

51:26.837 --> 51:28.924
Then Iraq, Baghdad, somewhere.

51:29.673 --> 51:31.342
You were never in the
military, were you?

51:33.302 --> 51:35.805
Let's kill him. Yeah?
Kill him?

51:36.138 --> 51:38.225
No. Sorry.

51:39.099 --> 51:40.310
I should never lie to you.

51:41.310 --> 51:42.900
I never meant any harm.

51:44.104 --> 51:47.948
All I wanted to be
is a military man.

51:49.109 --> 51:51.031
Ever since I was a little boy,

51:51.862 --> 51:54.448
running in the fields of Nebraska.

51:54.531 --> 51:56.916
Man, this is just getting pathetic.

51:56.992 --> 51:59.542
I don't even know how to read.

51:59.786 --> 52:01.788
Come on. What does that
have to do with anything?

52:01.872 --> 52:03.295
It's to make you feel bad.

52:03.916 --> 52:04.959
Okay.

52:05.042 --> 52:07.925
Okay. Keep this pressed
hard against that.

52:08.212 --> 52:10.133
We gotta get this fixed up.

52:10.214 --> 52:11.886
Thank you, brothers.

52:11.965 --> 52:13.805
Hey, listen, guys.

52:13.884 --> 52:16.434
I found something in the jungle.

52:17.095 --> 52:19.101
Something you should see.

52:25.771 --> 52:28.535
That's where I've
been hiding in shame.

52:39.785 --> 52:41.505
What is this place?

52:41.828 --> 52:44.332
It looks like some
kind of bomb shelter.

52:44.414 --> 52:45.838
It's cosy.

52:45.916 --> 52:48.550
It's been very lonely
here by myself.

52:48.627 --> 52:51.510
But now, you can stay with me.

52:51.588 --> 52:52.762
Okay. All right.

52:52.840 --> 52:55.520
It will be like a sleepover.

52:56.593 --> 52:58.230
- I found a flare gun.
- Nice.

52:58.637 --> 52:59.848
Is this a radio?

52:59.930 --> 53:02.564
- Jared, check it out.
- I'm on it. Okay.

53:03.851 --> 53:06.484
Hey, guys. We can stay up all night.

53:07.020 --> 53:09.108
We can tell scary stories.

53:09.189 --> 53:11.740
And we can play Truth or Dare.

53:11.817 --> 53:13.952
Chris, you first.

53:15.070 --> 53:16.577
Dare me to do something.

53:17.114 --> 53:19.913
Uh... I guess I would
dare you to be quiet, Storm.

53:19.992 --> 53:22.119
You lost a lot of blood.
Let me take a look at that.

53:25.664 --> 53:26.957
What you gonna do?

53:27.040 --> 53:28.927
- Be still.
- Needles!

53:29.459 --> 53:32.177
No needles!
I hate needles.

53:32.588 --> 53:34.588
- Get away from me!
- Do you wanna die of gangrene?

53:34.631 --> 53:35.758
I don't want needles!

53:35.841 --> 53:37.561
All right. All right. All right.
No needles.

53:37.926 --> 53:39.137
No needles. Come on.

53:39.219 --> 53:43.016
What if I pet your ears?
Would that make you feel better?

53:43.140 --> 53:44.860
Okay, Brenda.

53:44.933 --> 53:46.060
There you go.

53:46.143 --> 53:48.314
No needle.
No needle, Storm.

53:48.395 --> 53:49.980
- Thank you, Chris.
- You're doing good.

53:50.022 --> 53:52.109
You've got some floppy ears.

53:52.191 --> 53:54.278
- Can I finish cleaning it, though? Okay.
- Yes.

53:54.568 --> 53:55.991
- No, you're doing...
- It hurts!

53:56.069 --> 53:58.454
You're doing very good.
You're doing very good.

53:59.156 --> 54:00.248
He's a good bunny, right?

54:00.324 --> 54:01.581
He's a great bunny.

54:01.658 --> 54:03.628
- Okay, okay, okay.
- He's a feisty bunny.

54:03.702 --> 54:05.838
- It hurt, man!
- All right. Try and relax.

54:05.913 --> 54:07.034
- Okay.
- Just try and relax.

54:07.039 --> 54:09.423
You think you can get
this thing to work?

54:09.499 --> 54:11.090
Short answer: no.

54:11.168 --> 54:13.387
Not a needle.
Not a needle.

54:13.462 --> 54:15.716
Circuitry's fried,
but the transceiver's good.

54:15.797 --> 54:17.517
But the one in the plane,
transceiver's out,

54:17.530 --> 54:19.200
but the circuitry there
looked all right.

54:19.593 --> 54:20.850
We don't speak geek.

54:20.928 --> 54:24.024
Listen, darling,
what I'm trying to say is

54:24.097 --> 54:25.984
if we get that radio
out of the plane,

54:26.058 --> 54:28.060
there's a decent chance
I could rig something up.

54:28.101 --> 54:29.861
What about him?
We can't just leave him here.

54:29.937 --> 54:30.980
I'm okay.

54:31.939 --> 54:33.529
I'll be fine.

54:36.401 --> 54:38.453
We'll work something out.

54:44.743 --> 54:47.211
Stop. Park me here.

54:56.380 --> 54:57.721
What do you see?

55:00.133 --> 55:02.851
I am not quite sure.

55:02.928 --> 55:04.648
Dude, let me see.

55:08.559 --> 55:10.729
They've all gone shit-dick crazy.

55:10.811 --> 55:13.528
Yes, I saw Phil forcing them to eat

55:13.605 --> 55:16.619
that Jimsonweed all day.

55:16.692 --> 55:20.868
I tried a little bit of it myself, but
I was tripping balls for six hours.

55:20.946 --> 55:21.990
Couldn't feel my face.

55:22.739 --> 55:24.293
What is that?

55:24.908 --> 55:26.498
Let me see those.

55:28.996 --> 55:31.676
Oh, Phil has had a
statue of himself made.

55:35.002 --> 55:36.343
Oh!

55:37.129 --> 55:38.932
Solid craftsmanship.

55:41.550 --> 55:44.398
And they're worshipping
him like a God.

55:45.429 --> 55:48.110
I guess reasoning with him
isn't gonna be an option.

55:48.182 --> 55:50.732
Maybe we should just
take the radio.

55:50.809 --> 55:53.490
I mean, the plane's at least
200 yards from Phil's camp.

55:53.562 --> 55:55.234
He might not notice.

55:55.856 --> 55:58.075
No such luck. They got guards
stationed at the plane.

55:58.150 --> 55:59.787
- That crazy fucker!
- God.

55:59.860 --> 56:01.283
It's like he doesn't
even wanna go home.

56:01.361 --> 56:05.454
Hey, guys, if we want to steal
that radio from that plane,

56:06.325 --> 56:08.579
we'll have to use our
heads and our brains.

56:09.661 --> 56:12.165
It's the same fucking thing, Storm.

56:12.331 --> 56:15.178
I think I'll go talk to him alone.
I can still reason with him.

56:15.250 --> 56:17.552
- Are you sure, Chris?
- Yeah.

56:22.549 --> 56:23.593
Hey.

56:25.469 --> 56:27.474
Just be careful, okay?

56:28.639 --> 56:30.062
I will.

56:32.100 --> 56:33.691
Aw!

56:37.856 --> 56:39.114
What?

56:52.871 --> 56:57.261
Keep in pile. You, separate sticks.
Big sticks, little sticks.

57:03.674 --> 57:04.848
Oh!

57:04.925 --> 57:06.136
Deserter returns.

57:07.386 --> 57:08.643
Halt, Outsider.

57:08.971 --> 57:10.014
You're a trespasser here.

57:10.097 --> 57:12.861
Hey, Dale. What's up?
Look, I just wanna talk.

57:13.767 --> 57:16.068
Hi. Hi. How are you?

57:16.144 --> 57:17.236
What is your purpose here?

57:17.646 --> 57:20.031
Wow. You guys have really gotten
serious around here, huh?

57:20.107 --> 57:22.824
Gone is the time of mirth and joy.
Those days ended

57:22.901 --> 57:26.080
when the great winged beast of iron and
steel brought us here from the sky.

57:26.405 --> 57:29.285
Are you talking about the plane, Dale?
Come on. You know what a plane is.

57:29.324 --> 57:31.211
Look, I just need to talk to Phil.
Do you know where he is?

57:31.285 --> 57:32.875
Who is this "Phil" you speak of?

57:33.120 --> 57:34.710
He speaks of the Lawgiver.

57:34.830 --> 57:36.040
Okay.

57:36.123 --> 57:37.333
- Oh, Orco.
- Orco.

57:37.416 --> 57:38.507
- Orco?
- Oh, yeah.

57:38.584 --> 57:39.627
<i>Oy.</i>

57:39.710 --> 57:41.797
No one demands to see the Lawgiver.

57:41.879 --> 57:42.922
Let's slit his throat.

57:43.046 --> 57:45.680
Whoa, come on. Come on, Dale.
Calm down, you guys.

57:45.757 --> 57:46.801
Hey. Hey. All right.

57:48.051 --> 57:49.807
- Come on. Let's not. Let's not.
- Wait.

57:51.054 --> 57:54.020
Well, Outsider,
it seems you get your wish.

57:54.099 --> 57:55.772
The Lawgiver will see you.

57:55.851 --> 57:57.025
Okay.

58:29.343 --> 58:31.146
Did you come here to kill me?

58:31.929 --> 58:34.728
Come on, Phil. This is stupid.
Just knock it off.

58:34.932 --> 58:37.897
I would watch your tongue
if I were you, Outsider.

58:37.976 --> 58:39.317
Okay. Noted.

58:39.728 --> 58:41.816
Look, Phil, we found a bunker.

58:42.022 --> 58:43.445
Phil?

58:44.316 --> 58:47.033
Phil. I don't know this word.

58:47.361 --> 58:49.164
Right, no, I'm sorry.

58:49.530 --> 58:50.573
Orco.

58:50.781 --> 58:53.284
Yes. Orco.

58:54.493 --> 58:57.542
Do you know how I chose
the name Orco for myself?

58:57.621 --> 59:01.963
It's the name of an ancient Babylonian
God, the god of wrath and destruction.

59:02.042 --> 59:05.885
I think it was also the name of that
floaty little wizard guy in He-Man.

59:05.963 --> 59:07.469
- Heresy!
- Calm.

59:08.841 --> 59:10.051
Calm, my pet.

59:12.052 --> 59:13.096
I spell mine with a C.

59:13.762 --> 59:14.806
So it's different.

59:14.888 --> 59:16.229
Yeah, it's different.

59:16.682 --> 59:18.070
Yes.

59:18.350 --> 59:20.402
Time for my morning juice.

59:30.237 --> 59:32.408
Very bitter. That's gross!

59:32.489 --> 59:33.996
To the Pit of Shame with you!

59:36.493 --> 59:37.537
You shame yourself!

59:40.372 --> 59:42.342
Come, let's take a walk.

59:47.004 --> 59:49.507
This is where my minions toil
to harvest the beans

59:49.590 --> 59:51.974
from which we make the sacred brew.

59:52.968 --> 59:54.439
Pick faster. Faster.

59:55.637 --> 59:58.983
Well, it's nice to see that you
didn't eat Javier at least.

59:59.057 --> 01:00:01.822
I actually tried a couple of his fingers,
but it was gross.

01:00:01.894 --> 01:00:02.985
Really gamy.

01:00:03.061 --> 01:00:05.197
Keep the berries separate.

01:00:06.064 --> 01:00:08.629
Do you see the power
that I have over them?

01:00:09.526 --> 01:00:11.033
I do, yeah.

01:00:11.945 --> 01:00:14.247
I'm willing to give
you a taste of it.

01:00:14.323 --> 01:00:16.909
I'm offering you a job
as my second in command.

01:00:16.992 --> 01:00:18.249
Why?

01:00:18.327 --> 01:00:22.040
Because I could use someone
with your know-how

01:00:22.122 --> 01:00:26.631
for the day-to-day running-the-camp
stuff, basically all the boring shit.

01:00:28.212 --> 01:00:30.548
Gee, Orco,
I'm really flattered, but...

01:00:30.631 --> 01:00:32.303
Did I mention the perks?

01:00:32.382 --> 01:00:36.179
Power, glory,
any woman you want.

01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:39.012
Well, none of the super hot ones.
Those are for me.

01:00:39.014 --> 01:00:41.979
But, you know, any of the older,
chubbier ones. Barbara from accounting.

01:00:42.059 --> 01:00:43.649
Oh, she's a big girl.

01:00:43.727 --> 01:00:45.779
Yeah, I don't want Barbara
from accounting, or...

01:00:45.854 --> 01:00:48.702
You haven't even gotten to know her.
She's a sweet lady.

01:00:48.774 --> 01:00:51.657
Listen, we found
another radio, okay?

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:55.114
Jared thinks he can get it working if we
can get a part from the one on the plane.

01:00:57.533 --> 01:00:58.743
I don't know, bro.

01:00:58.825 --> 01:01:01.459
I kind of got a pretty good deal
going on here, you know?

01:01:01.537 --> 01:01:05.962
Out there I'm just a senior VP,
but here I'm a god.

01:01:06.041 --> 01:01:07.085
Orco.

01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:09.007
Yeah, but think about this.

01:01:09.086 --> 01:01:12.550
You give us that part. We get out
of here. You're a hero.

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:15.390
Not just here on the island,
but out there in the real world.

01:01:15.509 --> 01:01:17.312
Everybody's gonna know your name.

01:01:17.803 --> 01:01:19.060
Hmm...

01:01:19.721 --> 01:01:21.477
- interesting.
- Yeah.

01:01:21.557 --> 01:01:24.356
That you would try to sweet talk me
into giving up my empire.

01:01:24.434 --> 01:01:26.356
LOL, friend. Guards!

01:01:27.187 --> 01:01:30.533
Phil. Phil, please.
We're never gonna get off this island.

01:01:30.607 --> 01:01:31.651
No, we won't.

01:01:31.984 --> 01:01:33.740
If you come back here
again, Outsider,

01:01:33.819 --> 01:01:36.500
we will cut off your dick
and make a soup out of it.

01:01:36.572 --> 01:01:37.959
Cream of Chris!

01:01:39.741 --> 01:01:42.506
- Let's go play some hacky sack.
- Got it.

01:01:43.036 --> 01:01:46.999
Poor little bunny.
You almost got eaten by a tiger.

01:01:47.374 --> 01:01:49.296
I wish I could give you a carrot.

01:01:49.918 --> 01:01:51.805
- That would be nice.
- Yeah.

01:01:51.879 --> 01:01:54.678
Storm, I think your wound is
getting worse. It kind of stinks.

01:01:54.923 --> 01:01:56.513
Is that what that is?

01:01:56.592 --> 01:01:57.719
It smells nasty.

01:01:57.843 --> 01:02:00.975
I also didn't take a bath
for a while, okay?

01:02:04.933 --> 01:02:05.977
Tell me you got it.

01:02:06.310 --> 01:02:07.401
I'd be lying.

01:02:07.477 --> 01:02:08.569
Seriously, dude?

01:02:08.645 --> 01:02:10.900
Yeah. I asked.
He said no.

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:13.446
You asked?

01:02:13.525 --> 01:02:17.915
He asked. I'm so fucking glad you asked.
Did you say please, at least, Chris?

01:02:17.988 --> 01:02:19.162
- Jared.
- Yes.

01:02:19.239 --> 01:02:24.245
No. I'm tired. I'm cranky.
I'm out of weed, and I wanna go home!

01:02:24.328 --> 01:02:27.414
What do you want me to do, Jared?
You want me to challenge Phil to a fight?

01:02:27.497 --> 01:02:29.253
No, Chris.

01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:31.636
I want you to continue
being the world's

01:02:31.663 --> 01:02:34.247
biggest pussy until we
all die of starvation.

01:02:34.296 --> 01:02:38.092
Oh! Come on! You're the pussy.
You're the pussy!

01:02:38.175 --> 01:02:39.812
- You're a pussy.
- You're the pussy!

01:02:39.885 --> 01:02:42.104
Guys! This is not getting
us anywhere, okay?

01:02:42.179 --> 01:02:45.607
Brenda, who is the bigger
female reproductive organ?

01:02:45.891 --> 01:02:48.608
I think you're both vaginas.

01:02:48.727 --> 01:02:50.854
You know what?
I would've been better off with Phil.

01:02:51.605 --> 01:02:53.859
Wow.
Why don't you go join him then?

01:02:53.941 --> 01:02:56.658
Yeah. At least he's doing drugs
and having orgies.

01:02:56.735 --> 01:02:58.613
Instead I'm gonna die
in here with you clowns.

01:02:58.654 --> 01:03:00.493
Oh! Screw this!

01:03:00.739 --> 01:03:01.866
<i>Adiós!</i>

01:03:09.373 --> 01:03:11.294
- Hey

01:03:12.292 --> 01:03:14.760
- You okay?
- I don't know.

01:03:14.837 --> 01:03:17.933
You think Jared's right
about me being the...

01:03:18.757 --> 01:03:20.228
The world's biggest pussy?

01:03:21.301 --> 01:03:22.938
Yeah. That's the one.

01:03:25.931 --> 01:03:27.224
No.

01:03:28.267 --> 01:03:30.770
You're not a pussy.
You're just...

01:03:31.436 --> 01:03:33.572
- Nice?
- Yeah. You're really nice.

01:03:33.647 --> 01:03:36.660
Yeah. I know.
I think that's part of the problem.

01:03:37.401 --> 01:03:39.572
My whole life,
I'm such a nice guy.

01:03:39.653 --> 01:03:43.533
"It's Chris. He's so nice.
Look at Chris, he's nice."

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:45.580
Which is all well and good,
you know?

01:03:45.659 --> 01:03:48.829
Except that nobody ever gives you any
of the credit you deserve for anything.

01:03:49.037 --> 01:03:52.419
Or will actually even consider publishing
your really good fantasy novel,

01:03:52.499 --> 01:03:55.180
even though it's clearly
better than 90%

01:03:55.252 --> 01:03:57.933
of the Sword and Shadows
derivative crap that's out there.

01:03:58.088 --> 01:04:01.057
And it's like these
out-of-touch publishers

01:04:01.084 --> 01:04:03.916
are calling it fetish
porn, and it's not.

01:04:04.219 --> 01:04:07.767
Okay, yes, there's one
very tastefully done,

01:04:07.848 --> 01:04:10.945
very understated love scene
between a dark elf and a centaur.

01:04:11.059 --> 01:04:13.444
And that is integral to the plot.
You know?

01:04:15.063 --> 01:04:16.237
You need it...

01:04:16.315 --> 01:04:18.270
Okay, Chris, I think
maybe you're drifting

01:04:18.297 --> 01:04:19.888
away from the point
here a little.

01:04:21.111 --> 01:04:25.536
The point is that you
just keep taking it

01:04:25.616 --> 01:04:29.079
because you're too nice to stand
up and do anything about it.

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:33.546
Yeah.
You're nice. You are.

01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:37.474
That's what I like about you.
That's what everyone likes about you.

01:04:37.503 --> 01:04:39.342
I wouldn't want you to change that.

01:04:39.671 --> 01:04:41.059
But there's a time to be nice.

01:04:41.131 --> 01:04:45.853
And then there's also a time when you
have to say, "Enough is enough."

01:04:45.928 --> 01:04:48.976
And stick your foot
so far up a prick like Phil's ass

01:04:49.056 --> 01:04:52.105
that he chokes on your
fucking shoelaces.

01:04:52.184 --> 01:04:54.604
And I think now is
one of those times.

01:04:58.941 --> 01:05:00.328
I do, too.

01:05:03.195 --> 01:05:05.615
- How did you...
- Listen, Chris.

01:05:06.532 --> 01:05:10.458
There's a time to play nice.
And there's also come a time

01:05:10.536 --> 01:05:13.004
when you have to say,
"Enough is enough."

01:05:14.081 --> 01:05:18.043
And stick your foot so far
up a prick like Phil's ass

01:05:18.126 --> 01:05:23.050
that he chokes on your own
fucking shoelaces.

01:05:24.424 --> 01:05:27.687
That is literally exactly
what I just said.

01:05:27.886 --> 01:05:31.268
No. I just tweaked it a little bit.

01:05:32.766 --> 01:05:35.186
No. Word for word.

01:05:35.435 --> 01:05:38.283
I had my own little spin, okay?

01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:41.827
How long have you been there?

01:05:42.484 --> 01:05:43.907
For awhile.

01:05:46.947 --> 01:05:47.991
This is our plan.

01:05:48.073 --> 01:05:50.790
We are stealing that goddamn radio.

01:05:50.868 --> 01:05:52.920
And I drew the little guys there.

01:06:37.289 --> 01:06:40.137
Shit. Sorry, Deb.
Some woman.

01:06:40.209 --> 01:06:41.881
Sorry, guys. Sorry.

01:06:53.639 --> 01:06:55.140
Ow! Damn it!
What the hell you doing?

01:06:56.642 --> 01:06:58.481
Son of a bitch?
What are you doing?

01:06:58.977 --> 01:07:00.484
Use a bigger rock!

01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:02.944
Ow!

01:07:04.191 --> 01:07:05.283
Yeah.

01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:12.164
Good night, sweet prince.
You had a good run.

01:07:15.202 --> 01:07:17.966
Okay, great. Get the radio,
and we'll stand guard.

01:07:19.414 --> 01:07:21.174
Well, obviously, you know,
quick as possible.

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:22.793
- Speed is of the essence.
- Copy that.

01:07:22.835 --> 01:07:23.878
How'd it go?

01:07:23.961 --> 01:07:25.004
- We got him.
- Great job.

01:07:25.087 --> 01:07:26.807
- This is invigorating.
- Yeah.

01:07:31.635 --> 01:07:32.976
Do not fuck this up.

01:07:33.262 --> 01:07:36.192
- Thanks, Brenda. That helps a lot.
- You're welcome.

01:07:50.696 --> 01:07:52.783
- What does that mean?
- I don't know that call.

01:07:52.865 --> 01:07:55.325
- Did you discuss that with him?
- He didn't teach it to us.

01:07:55.659 --> 01:07:58.376
We're gonna hold.
We're gonna hold.

01:08:04.334 --> 01:08:06.802
Hey, Jared.
I'm not trying to be a pest, man.

01:08:06.879 --> 01:08:09.382
- What's the ETA?
- You wanna do this?

01:08:09.882 --> 01:08:11.269
Okay. I understand.

01:08:11.341 --> 01:08:12.848
- Actually, he's working.
- Yeah.

01:08:12.926 --> 01:08:14.511
Let the man work.
You know what I mean?

01:08:18.432 --> 01:08:19.773
Screw faster!

01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.010
Yeah, I've heard that before.

01:08:21.059 --> 01:08:23.064
Yeah. You fell asleep
between thrusts.

01:08:23.145 --> 01:08:25.613
Oh, my God. That's why you
ruined our trip to Reno.

01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:26.733
There it is. Right there.

01:08:26.814 --> 01:08:29.035
I wasn't sure if it was
sex time or nap time.

01:08:40.746 --> 01:08:41.872
What was that?

01:08:41.955 --> 01:08:43.379
I think it was a conch.

01:08:43.457 --> 01:08:44.009
Screw faster!

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:46.117
I'm trying to! Can you
please be supportive?

01:08:46.167 --> 01:08:47.260
Come on!

01:08:47.336 --> 01:08:49.671
- Guys!
- Guys! Another time.

01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:51.720
- They're, like, always fighting.
- I know.

01:08:51.798 --> 01:08:54.515
And it's, like,
sometimes I feel like...

01:08:54.593 --> 01:08:55.636
Look!

01:08:57.638 --> 01:09:00.140
Jared, get the radio!
Rip it out!

01:09:02.684 --> 01:09:04.524
- Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
- All right, ready?

01:09:04.645 --> 01:09:06.531
I think they've got spears.

01:09:06.604 --> 01:09:09.149
They're not gonna throw 'em.
That's for show. That's for show.

01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:14.077
By the power of Orco, keep my
hand steady and make my aim true.

01:09:14.154 --> 01:09:15.910
Yeah, yeah, Brett.
Just throw it.

01:09:17.908 --> 01:09:19.545
Holy shit!
They're throwing spears!

01:09:22.246 --> 01:09:23.502
Time to go!

01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:34.805
Hey, guys!

01:09:48.522 --> 01:09:50.112
Where's Storm?

01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:51.234
I thought you had him.

01:09:51.316 --> 01:09:53.701
I thought you had him!
You were the wheelbarrow guy.

01:09:53.777 --> 01:09:54.821
Oops!

01:09:54.903 --> 01:09:55.947
Oh, Jared!

01:09:56.029 --> 01:09:57.309
Okay, I'm gonna go look for him.

01:09:57.364 --> 01:09:59.120
Stay here and get to work
and get that radio going.

01:09:59.199 --> 01:10:00.326
Wait. You're going back out there?

01:10:00.409 --> 01:10:03.090
Yeah. I'll be right back.
Shut the door behind me.

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:06.217
Oh. my God!

01:10:17.384 --> 01:10:18.558
Storm!

01:10:20.095 --> 01:10:21.602
Mr Rothchild!

01:10:22.890 --> 01:10:23.933
Storm!

01:10:29.146 --> 01:10:30.190
Is it working?

01:10:30.564 --> 01:10:31.245
It's hard to say.

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.971
If 1 did it right, then we're
emitting a constant distress signal.

01:10:33.984 --> 01:10:36.821
But the only way to be sure is to
actually make contact with someone.

01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:55.011
Get off me, Dale.

01:10:55.088 --> 01:10:57.473
Bitch got a flare gun.

01:10:57.549 --> 01:11:01.262
Outsider! Outsider!

01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:04.853
I have your friends now.
You're all alone!

01:11:05.265 --> 01:11:07.401
- As for the girl...
- Ah!

01:11:07.893 --> 01:11:11.950
that'd be a shame to pluck this
fruit and not have a little taste.

01:11:13.023 --> 01:11:15.194
Talk about having her fruit, man.

01:11:15.275 --> 01:11:17.494
Sexy fruit.

01:11:17.569 --> 01:11:19.372
Her vagina berries.

01:11:19.988 --> 01:11:22.492
I'm gonna have sex
with your girlfriend in her vagina.

01:11:22.574 --> 01:11:23.618
You think he got that?

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.702
- Yeah, I think he got it.
- All right, let's go.

01:11:26.203 --> 01:11:27.710
Ah! Ow!

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:39.300
Bring forth the prisoners.

01:11:39.466 --> 01:11:41.139
Bring forth the prisoners!

01:12:41.028 --> 01:12:42.867
It's okay. It's okay.

01:12:45.782 --> 01:12:50.208
You've all been found guilty of the
high crimes of heresy and thievery.

01:12:50.287 --> 01:12:51.331
Kill.

01:12:51.413 --> 01:12:54.177
Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:12:54.374 --> 01:12:56.545
They're kidding, right?

01:12:56.835 --> 01:12:59.303
Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:12:59.671 --> 01:13:02.637
- Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Uh...

01:13:02.716 --> 01:13:03.760
Guys?

01:13:03.842 --> 01:13:05.396
Holy shit.

01:13:05.469 --> 01:13:06.940
Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:13:07.012 --> 01:13:09.812
The punishment for these crimes
is death by execution.

01:13:12.851 --> 01:13:14.737
Oh, my God. That's it. I'm go...

01:13:16.063 --> 01:13:17.949
Except for the fair Lisa...

01:13:19.983 --> 01:13:22.617
You will live and be my bride.

01:13:24.071 --> 01:13:26.574
Oh, come on.
Can't you just kill me, too?

01:13:28.742 --> 01:13:29.786
You don't mean that.

01:13:29.868 --> 01:13:33.380
I really mean it, Phil.
Just do it.

01:13:34.331 --> 01:13:35.968
- Here she comes.
- Oh, yeah.

01:13:36.917 --> 01:13:38.340
Good call. Good call.

01:13:39.294 --> 01:13:40.682
Mmm!

01:13:41.213 --> 01:13:42.850
What is that smell?

01:13:44.258 --> 01:13:46.559
It's pussy.

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:49.015
You, who are called Jared,

01:13:49.346 --> 01:13:50.557
come forward.

01:13:54.142 --> 01:13:55.530
Step forward, Jared!

01:13:59.189 --> 01:14:00.233
Dale.

01:14:01.817 --> 01:14:04.616
All right. It's funny, Phil.
I get it. It's not cool.

01:14:04.695 --> 01:14:06.664
You have anything to
say before you die?

01:14:08.156 --> 01:14:09.497
You're a real asshole, Phil.

01:14:09.867 --> 01:14:11.872
- What?
- Be that as it may...

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.542
- Still, you shall die.
- Yes!

01:14:18.083 --> 01:14:19.637
He's just kidding.

01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:21.762
Phil. No.
Come on, I'll do anything.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.344
Dale.

01:14:23.422 --> 01:14:26.186
Phil, I'm begging you, brother.
Please don't.

01:14:26.258 --> 01:14:27.302
We'll be your slaves.

01:14:27.384 --> 01:14:29.606
Yeah, we get it, whatever
you fucking want.

01:14:29.633 --> 01:14:31.551
Don't have Dale cut
my head off, man.

01:14:31.763 --> 01:14:32.855
You don't wanna do this.

01:14:32.931 --> 01:14:34.403
Phil. Please, man.

01:14:43.275 --> 01:14:46.205
This isn't you, man.
Things just got weird.

01:14:53.368 --> 01:14:54.661
Sorry, dude.

01:14:55.162 --> 01:14:58.092
I was just gonna put you in a cage,
or whip you with bamboo or something.

01:14:58.165 --> 01:14:59.339
But, well...

01:15:02.461 --> 01:15:03.802
It's what they want.

01:15:04.254 --> 01:15:05.465
Please.

01:15:14.973 --> 01:15:16.231
I love you, Brenda.

01:15:16.391 --> 01:15:17.483
You do?

01:15:17.559 --> 01:15:18.686
I'm sorry.

01:15:18.769 --> 01:15:23.075
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:15:24.858 --> 01:15:26.199
Make it quick, Dale.

01:15:26.276 --> 01:15:29.658
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:15:29.947 --> 01:15:31.418
Do it, Dale.

01:15:50.926 --> 01:15:53.180
Wait!

01:15:58.892 --> 01:16:00.778
Lower your blade!

01:16:04.314 --> 01:16:08.537
So, you've returned just in time
to watch your friends die.

01:16:08.610 --> 01:16:09.868
Perhaps you'll join them.

01:16:10.112 --> 01:16:12.793
I don't think so, Orco.

01:16:12.865 --> 01:16:16.578
I have returned to claim
my rightful place

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.879
as the true god of this tribe!

01:16:20.914 --> 01:16:23.678
You? A god?

01:16:24.042 --> 01:16:25.170
That's right.

01:16:25.252 --> 01:16:28.633
And I command my subjects
to sever their allegiance

01:16:28.714 --> 01:16:34.729
to the false Lord Orco and
bow before my mighty loins,

01:16:35.137 --> 01:16:38.020
lest they should feel my wrath.

01:16:38.891 --> 01:16:40.018
Tell me.

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:43.612
Can the impostor Orco fly
as the birds of the sky do?

01:16:46.106 --> 01:16:47.280
Just a minute.

01:16:59.203 --> 01:17:00.709
Almost there.

01:17:33.529 --> 01:17:35.082
That was amazing.

01:17:36.782 --> 01:17:38.253
1 mean, 1...

01:17:39.826 --> 01:17:41.250
That was unreal.

01:17:41.662 --> 01:17:43.916
Or, can the impostor conjure fire

01:17:44.748 --> 01:17:46.338
from stone?

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:01.853
Oh! Oh!

01:18:05.477 --> 01:18:06.521
Magic tricks.

01:18:06.603 --> 01:18:08.359
These are tricks! Don't be fooled!

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.862
Really? I'm not sure the tribe
is quite so convinced.

01:18:12.317 --> 01:18:16.244
So either prove to me your divinity
by fighting and killing me,

01:18:16.321 --> 01:18:19.204
or you will reveal
yourself to be a liar,

01:18:19.366 --> 01:18:22.249
a coward,
and an all-around piece of shit.

01:18:23.871 --> 01:18:26.588
Fine! I accept your challenge!

01:18:26.707 --> 01:18:27.834
Good.

01:18:27.916 --> 01:18:31.594
We will resolve this once and for all
with a fight to the death.

01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:33.307
To the Pit of Destiny.

01:18:37.593 --> 01:18:39.977
Where's the Pit of Destiny?

01:18:40.053 --> 01:18:42.687
Let's just clear out
the Pit of Shame.

01:18:43.891 --> 01:18:45.278
Yeah.

01:18:52.774 --> 01:18:55.360
Come on! Yeah! Yeah!

01:18:56.528 --> 01:18:59.743
I guess we both always knew
it'd come to this. Right, Chris?

01:18:59.823 --> 01:19:01.793
I honestly never saw this coming.

01:19:05.537 --> 01:19:08.420
This is pretty fucked up.
I will say that.

01:19:08.624 --> 01:19:10.843
Not your typical day at the
office, huh, boy?

01:19:12.961 --> 01:19:14.764
Chris, I do wanna apologise.

01:19:14.963 --> 01:19:17.218
I'm sorry I took things this far.

01:19:17.549 --> 01:19:18.641
This is fucked up.

01:19:18.926 --> 01:19:21.097
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

01:19:21.803 --> 01:19:23.394
Well, we don't have to do this.

01:19:28.018 --> 01:19:29.525
Chris, get up!

01:19:33.649 --> 01:19:35.535
This is really pretty gay.

01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:41.451
Yeah, it's fucking sick, man.

01:19:41.532 --> 01:19:43.334
It's gay. It's gross.

01:19:53.085 --> 01:19:54.473
Troy!

01:19:54.545 --> 01:19:55.968
Troy, my spear.

01:19:57.923 --> 01:19:59.346
That's unfair, Troy!

01:19:59.716 --> 01:20:01.188
You asshole!

01:20:01.385 --> 01:20:02.938
Come on, Phil!

01:20:12.437 --> 01:20:13.529
Chris!

01:20:13.605 --> 01:20:17.117
Is that a nut sack between your legs,
or did your dick step in gum?

01:20:30.414 --> 01:20:31.624
Come on! Get up, Chris!

01:20:33.083 --> 01:20:34.424
Yeah! Come on!

01:20:34.835 --> 01:20:36.970
Chris! Kick his ass!

01:20:38.922 --> 01:20:40.180
No!

01:20:40.382 --> 01:20:42.055
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay.

01:20:42.551 --> 01:20:45.268
Okay, me and you will be co-gods.

01:20:45.345 --> 01:20:46.733
Sixty/forty.

01:21:00.485 --> 01:21:02.288
Give me those hands.

01:21:02.988 --> 01:21:04.032
My warriors!

01:21:04.364 --> 01:21:06.452
What are you waiting for? Attack!

01:21:07.451 --> 01:21:10.630
Honestly, Phil,
I'm not really into this any more.

01:21:17.711 --> 01:21:19.301
Stay there!

01:21:38.524 --> 01:21:40.659
Okay. Okay, you can get up.

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:43.531
Okay, come on. Stop it.
I'm not a god.

01:21:43.612 --> 01:21:45.415
There's no god here.

01:21:45.822 --> 01:21:48.124
Or, I mean, you can believe
whatever you wanna believe.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:53.005
God, He can be all around. I don't know.
But I am not a god and Phil is not a god.

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.337
But I am in charge now.

01:21:54.998 --> 01:21:57.169
And from now on, things are
gonna be different. Okay?

01:21:57.709 --> 01:22:00.046
Dale, Javier, I need you
to get to the beach,

01:22:00.128 --> 01:22:02.928
get to work on getting that
signal fire going. Let's go.

01:22:03.006 --> 01:22:04.679
Ashley, untie them.

01:22:05.008 --> 01:22:06.301
Please!

01:22:08.178 --> 01:22:09.222
Brett?

01:22:09.346 --> 01:22:11.431
I can see your boner. I don't know.
It's your call.

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.941
Okay, guys. I'm going to
get you the help you need.

01:22:14.017 --> 01:22:16.402
We need to start a massive
detox programme.

01:22:16.687 --> 01:22:18.774
I'm gonna get this Jimsonweed
out of your system.

01:22:18.856 --> 01:22:20.649
You'll be feeling as
good as new in no time.

01:22:20.691 --> 01:22:21.734
And then we're gonna get home.

01:22:21.817 --> 01:22:23.240
- So really...
- Ship! Ship!

01:22:23.652 --> 01:22:26.701
There's a ship offshore.
I saw it from the bluff.

01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:27.872
He said there's a ship.

01:22:27.948 --> 01:22:29.328
They must've gotten
our distress signal.

01:22:29.356 --> 01:22:29.877
Oh, my God.

01:22:29.908 --> 01:22:31.498
Yeah, but they might not know
exactly where we are.

01:22:31.577 --> 01:22:34.045
- Where's that flare gun?
- I got it.

01:22:38.417 --> 01:22:40.089
Watch out!

01:22:40.919 --> 01:22:42.924
Ungrateful little bitch!

01:22:43.422 --> 01:22:46.139
I should've slit your throat
a long time ago.

01:22:46.383 --> 01:22:50.310
I'm a god here! And I'm not gonna
let you fuck that up for me.

01:23:29.092 --> 01:23:31.429
Okay. Storm, we got it.
Thank you.

01:23:33.263 --> 01:23:34.307
Good lungs.

01:23:35.307 --> 01:23:36.648
Nice work, Storm.

01:23:36.767 --> 01:23:38.487
I got your back, my brother.

01:23:40.521 --> 01:23:41.944
It doesn't matter anyway.

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:46.451
They'll never see your white flare
against the bright blue sky.

01:23:46.527 --> 01:23:48.366
You should know that, Boy Scout.

01:23:49.071 --> 01:23:51.621
It's Eagle Scout, asshole.

01:23:54.785 --> 01:23:57.715
No! My statue!

01:23:58.872 --> 01:24:00.379
My statue!

01:24:04.336 --> 01:24:06.306
Let's get to the beach!

01:24:08.966 --> 01:24:10.722
I gotcha, big guy.

01:24:13.846 --> 01:24:16.479
Hey!

01:24:18.308 --> 01:24:21.986
- Over here!
- Hey! Over here!

01:24:23.146 --> 01:24:24.857
Right here!

01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:45.921
Oh, Buddy.
I am so proud of you.

01:24:46.003 --> 01:24:47.842
- I'm proud of you.
- Oh!

01:24:47.921 --> 01:24:49.132
You're the best, dude.

01:24:49.214 --> 01:24:52.643
Jared. I love you again.

01:24:52.718 --> 01:24:54.355
Oh, thank God.

01:24:57.389 --> 01:24:59.940
You did it, Chris. You save us.

01:25:00.976 --> 01:25:03.147
Yes. Or so it would seem.

01:25:03.687 --> 01:25:05.858
That's right, all my friends.

01:25:06.064 --> 01:25:10.205
My death, tiger attack,
was all a test.

01:25:10.652 --> 01:25:12.539
And you all passed
with flying colour.

01:25:13.071 --> 01:25:15.657
Good work. To get here, quick.

01:25:16.491 --> 01:25:17.749
Storm...

01:25:18.202 --> 01:25:19.625
Okay. I'm lying again.

01:25:19.703 --> 01:25:20.747
Yeah.

01:25:20.829 --> 01:25:23.795
Storm Rothchild?
AKA Striker Hardcastle.

01:25:23.874 --> 01:25:26.757
- What?
- AKA Francois Van Vurenberg.

01:25:26.835 --> 01:25:28.923
AKA Schlomo Rabinowitz?

01:25:29.004 --> 01:25:31.056
You, sir, are under arrest
by the United States Navy

01:25:31.131 --> 01:25:32.342
for impersonating an officer.

01:25:32.758 --> 01:25:35.688
Well, hey.
Chris, can I talk to you?

01:25:36.261 --> 01:25:37.353
Yeah.

01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:41.359
While I'm in prison,
you'll write to me?

01:25:42.226 --> 01:25:43.353
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:44.687
How often?

01:25:46.730 --> 01:25:47.857
Write you once a month?

01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:48.983
I need more.

01:25:50.776 --> 01:25:52.164
I could do once a week.

01:25:52.819 --> 01:25:54.741
And you'll come to visit me?

01:25:56.281 --> 01:25:58.121
You got it.

01:25:58.200 --> 01:25:59.872
And, you know, Lisa?

01:26:00.494 --> 01:26:01.917
She has a crush on you.

01:26:12.965 --> 01:26:14.306
- This way, ma'am.
- Uh...

01:26:14.424 --> 01:26:16.264
I'm okay. I'm fine.

01:26:16.343 --> 01:26:19.273
All rescued persons need to
be seen by medical personnel.

01:26:19.346 --> 01:26:20.390
Okay.

01:26:20.681 --> 01:26:22.602
Look, dude, I...

01:26:26.311 --> 01:26:28.151
Watch out, Gilligan.

01:26:34.444 --> 01:26:35.951
How was that for more assertive?

01:26:36.029 --> 01:26:38.615
I didn't wanna come on too
strong, and I...

01:26:43.871 --> 01:26:45.757
I gotta admit it, Chris.

01:26:45.831 --> 01:26:48.334
I always saw you as kind
of a sissy boy.

01:26:48.417 --> 01:26:50.718
But you really proved me wrong
out there on that island.

01:26:51.003 --> 01:26:52.640
You got balls, son.

01:26:52.713 --> 01:26:55.181
Big balls. Just like me.

01:26:55.924 --> 01:26:59.637
I bet if we pulled our balls
out and compared them,

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:01.606
they'd be exactly the same size.

01:27:02.556 --> 01:27:04.608
You got a future here
with us, Chris.

01:27:04.683 --> 01:27:08.065
I'm promoting you to Senior
Vice President of Design.

01:27:13.984 --> 01:27:17.780
You can move your big balls
into Phil's old office right now.

01:27:19.364 --> 01:27:21.469
Mr Crawford, for the
last three years,

01:27:21.496 --> 01:27:23.816
I've dreamt of hearing
you say that to me.

01:27:24.494 --> 01:27:26.855
This position is exactly
what I've wanted.

01:27:26.882 --> 01:27:29.242
It has been on the top
of my vision board.

01:27:30.125 --> 01:27:31.964
But out there on that island,
I realised something.

01:27:32.044 --> 01:27:33.087
What's that, son?

01:27:33.170 --> 01:27:34.214
This job sucks.

01:27:34.296 --> 01:27:35.388
Excuse me?

01:27:35.464 --> 01:27:39.260
Yeah, man. It sucks.
Life is too short!

01:27:39.343 --> 01:27:40.600
You know, there's a whole
world out there.

01:27:40.677 --> 01:27:41.888
There's a whole freaking universe!

01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:43.931
I would rather take that
Martin P. Shulman Award

01:27:43.972 --> 01:27:45.693
and stab myself directly
in the heart with it,

01:27:45.766 --> 01:27:47.647
than spend my entire
life cooped up inside

01:27:47.674 --> 01:27:49.553
these walls climbing
the corporate ladder.

01:27:49.603 --> 01:27:51.655
No. I can't do it. I quit.

01:27:52.022 --> 01:27:53.196
Oh, no, you didn't.

01:27:55.067 --> 01:27:56.324
I quit, too.

01:27:56.401 --> 01:27:57.659
She quits, too.

01:28:00.030 --> 01:28:01.371
Want this closed?

01:28:32.688 --> 01:28:34.194
<i>Dear Troy,</i>

01:28:34.273 --> 01:28:37.867
<i>I can't tell you how disappointed
I am with you right now.</i>

01:28:37.943 --> 01:28:41.455
<i>I thought we were buds.
Well, let me tell you something.</i>

01:28:41.738 --> 01:28:43.541
<i>If I ever get off this island,</i>

01:28:43.615 --> 01:28:47.246
<i>you're gonna have to work
pretty hard to regain my trust.</i>

01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:50.966
<i>PS. I am very lonely.</i>

01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:53.176
<i>I'm so sad and lonely.</i>
