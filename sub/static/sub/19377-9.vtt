00:22.189 --> 00:25.025
[chorus singing] <i>Open your eyes</i>
<i>This destiny</i>

00:25.192 --> 00:28.228
<i>If I can't escape it</i>

00:28.295 --> 00:30.030
<i>Then I'll swallow it all down</i>

00:30.097 --> 00:34.334
<i>Both right and wrong</i>
<i>And I'll fight</i>

00:34.401 --> 00:35.769
AJIN: DEMI-HUMAN

00:40.807 --> 00:43.810
<i>The menace that dominates</i>

00:44.077 --> 00:47.114
<i>The darkness in my troubled mind</i>

00:47.180 --> 00:50.250
<i>The truth of a human</i>

00:50.317 --> 00:53.253
<i>Who has begun to lose control</i>

00:53.320 --> 00:55.589
<i>That meaninglessness</i>

00:55.656 --> 00:59.126
<i>I've come to know it</i>

00:59.493 --> 01:01.828
<i>If even counterfeit peace</i>

01:02.195 --> 01:05.599
<i>Will break into pieces</i>

01:05.666 --> 01:10.203
<i>I will cast</i>

01:10.304 --> 01:17.110
<i>A defiant shadow</i>

01:17.778 --> 01:20.781
<i>It's the end of escape</i>
<i>Stand up</i>

01:20.847 --> 01:24.084
<i>Because it's the only way</i>

01:24.151 --> 01:30.223
<i>Follow it</i>
<i>The small hope I aim for</i>

01:30.290 --> 01:33.293
<i>The weakness that spilled</i>
<i>From the proffered hand</i>

01:33.360 --> 01:36.496
<i>I swallowed it all down</i>

01:36.563 --> 01:43.170
<i>Both right and wrong</i>
<i>And lost my mind</i>

01:46.206 --> 01:51.144
YOU'RE THE ONE MESSING UP MY LIFE!

01:52.613 --> 01:55.182
-Get a move on!
-What's happening?!

01:55.248 --> 01:56.350
Put that fire out!

02:05.192 --> 02:06.360
Can you contact the AASF?!

02:06.426 --> 02:09.363
We can't restore the radio
or any of the electronics!

02:09.429 --> 02:11.665
Send someone to tell them
to come down!

02:11.732 --> 02:14.901
No good! We can't spare anyone
at our current fighting strength!

02:15.168 --> 02:17.237
But we need to call for reinforcements.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.506
You can get to the Metro P.D.
in 15 minutes!

02:19.740 --> 02:22.476
-If the radio's no good, then run!
-Yes, sir!

02:24.378 --> 02:29.282
What a shame. With things like this,
even that insurance you prepared...

02:29.349 --> 02:30.350
Shut up.

02:51.304 --> 02:52.305
Gen.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.574
Do you have a moment?

02:58.278 --> 02:59.446
Don't let your guard down.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.349
This unit's been formed
specifically to fight Ajin.

03:02.582 --> 03:04.851
But they're still just human, right?

03:06.353 --> 03:07.421
Yeah.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.792
Hostiles approaching,
seven of them.

03:11.858 --> 03:15.328
We can't use flashlights,
and there's a risk of friendly fire...

03:15.395 --> 03:17.431
Acclimate your eyes
to the surroundings.

03:17.831 --> 03:20.300
Team 3, take the private stairway
to the top floor.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.569
Team 4, protect the chairman
in the meeting room.

03:22.636 --> 03:25.238
Everyone else, stay here
and prepare for close combat.

03:25.572 --> 03:28.475
Don't just kill them clumsily.
Capture and subdue them.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.952
This situation has actually given us
a chance...

03:40.387 --> 03:41.822
Are we going up this way?

03:42.489 --> 03:44.291
Since Mr. Sato loves to fight,

03:44.357 --> 03:45.959
he's sure to attack the AASF head-on.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.730
If we take the stairs, there's a chance
we'll get caught in the battle.

03:49.796 --> 03:53.333
Shouldn't we take Sato down
while he's busy fighting the AASF?

03:53.400 --> 03:57.304
Since the enemy is targeting
the chairman,

03:57.370 --> 04:00.340
this strategy has a higher probability
of success.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.609
[gunshots]

04:03.410 --> 04:05.479
Sounds like there's no time to lose.

04:12.018 --> 04:15.288
Aim for the flashes from their gunfire.
Neutralize their weapons.

04:22.529 --> 04:25.332
-Reset them!
-No time to freak out about it! Shoot!

04:31.972 --> 04:32.839
Get back!

04:35.275 --> 04:38.879
Shit! My eyes! Damn it.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.319
Yes, they may not die.

04:46.653 --> 04:49.356
But... they're still just amateurs.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.394
[screaming]

04:58.331 --> 04:59.366
Damn it!

05:01.902 --> 05:03.303
How do you like this?!

05:08.608 --> 05:10.410
There! An IBM--

05:10.777 --> 05:11.845
In front of the pillar!

05:14.447 --> 05:15.649
That's not gonna work!

05:20.520 --> 05:22.088
It's coming from that guy!
Take him down!

05:28.795 --> 05:30.864
The mental link!

05:31.431 --> 05:32.532
Damn it.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.000
Damn it.

05:41.374 --> 05:42.409
[gasps]

05:42.475 --> 05:45.545
[Sato] So, these are
Anti-Ajin Special Forces...

05:46.913 --> 05:48.081
Living up to their name.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.785
-It's him.
-Quickly! Incapacitate him!

05:52.352 --> 05:54.020
Don't give him a chance to revive!

05:56.690 --> 05:57.724
Too slow.

06:00.860 --> 06:01.895
You!

06:05.131 --> 06:06.600
Those moves...

06:07.100 --> 06:08.435
Is he ex-military?!

06:11.771 --> 06:15.842
Yes, this is a fight between animals.

06:17.677 --> 06:18.745
[grunting and shouting]

06:28.655 --> 06:29.923
Now! Restrain him!

06:30.624 --> 06:34.394
Returning... the favor, Mr. Sato.

06:43.703 --> 06:44.871
[laughing]

06:45.105 --> 06:48.508
Now, time for another round!

06:55.415 --> 06:56.416
[gunshots]

07:03.189 --> 07:05.725
Go support Teams 1 and 2!
They're being pushed back!

07:05.792 --> 07:07.127
What's happened to the commander?

07:08.862 --> 07:09.896
Mr. Hirasawa.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.732
Right, we just need
to stop everyone but Sato.

07:14.534 --> 07:16.036
-Hey, dude--
-It's Manabe.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.705
-Remember already.
-Be careful.

07:19.506 --> 07:20.607
[chuckles]

07:28.748 --> 07:30.884
-What's going on?!
-We're getting overwhelmed!

07:36.723 --> 07:39.059
The only ones left are
in the meeting room.

07:39.826 --> 07:40.694
Keep going!

07:47.467 --> 07:49.536
-What?!
-There's more of them?!

07:49.970 --> 07:51.538
[shouting]

07:52.806 --> 07:55.475
Huh. Really takes you back, doesn't it?

07:55.542 --> 07:56.543
Sure does.

07:58.712 --> 08:03.683
Damn it. We'll keep them busy here!
You go on, Mr. Sato!

08:03.750 --> 08:05.852
Thanks, Tanaka!

08:12.192 --> 08:15.495
Takahashi, reset those guys slacking!

08:15.562 --> 08:16.963
I'm kind of busy here!

08:22.168 --> 08:25.205
And now for the final stage.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.678
[whimpering]

08:37.050 --> 08:39.886
Well, if it isn't Nagai.
It's been a while.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.789
What are you doing
in a place like this?

08:42.856 --> 08:43.890
You should know that.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.727
I'm here to stop you, Mr. Sato.

08:55.101 --> 08:56.569
Throw away your weapons.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.873
If you don't, I'll kill the chairman.

09:00.673 --> 09:01.941
[groans]

09:03.043 --> 09:05.912
You've certainly changed
since I saw you at the lab.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.315
Do you really think
I care about that man's life?

09:09.816 --> 09:11.584
If I kill the chairman,

09:12.252 --> 09:14.621
you'll fail at your own game.

09:15.288 --> 09:19.959
You couldn't stand to watch me take
all the fun away from you, could you?

09:20.593 --> 09:24.030
[laughs] So, you've got me
all figured out, have you?

09:24.764 --> 09:25.965
All because of you...

09:27.200 --> 09:29.869
my quiet life was turned upside down!

09:31.604 --> 09:33.640
Quiet life?

09:34.641 --> 09:38.912
[laughs] That's right. You just wanted
to live a nice quiet life, didn't you?

09:39.212 --> 09:43.216
But what is there for you really,
once you return to a normal life?

09:43.283 --> 09:46.186
I'll say it once more.
Put down your weapons.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.055
All you'd get is a life of boredom.

09:49.656 --> 09:55.095
I have no interest in every day being
like that. I need more fun in my life.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.197
And besides...

09:58.331 --> 10:00.333
one thing about me, Nagai...

10:01.334 --> 10:06.673
people messing up my game is
the one thing I hate more than any other.

10:07.774 --> 10:11.811
You're the one messing up my life!

10:11.878 --> 10:13.980
[chairman whimpering]

10:18.251 --> 10:19.986
[groans]

10:28.628 --> 10:29.929
Step away from the weapons!

10:32.098 --> 10:33.166
Mm?

10:34.134 --> 10:36.769
So, what is it you want to do?

10:36.970 --> 10:40.907
Buy time until help arrives? Or...?

10:42.308 --> 10:45.111
Are you trying to keep me
from resetting?

10:45.812 --> 10:48.781
You could get me
with a tranquilizer right now.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.383
Nakano, now!

10:50.950 --> 10:52.051
Sato!

10:57.290 --> 10:58.758
Damn it!

11:02.128 --> 11:03.396
So, that was it.

11:04.330 --> 11:08.301
It wasn't a bad plan,
but you forgot the most important--

11:13.139 --> 11:15.241
I'm sorry to have caused you
so much trouble.

11:18.144 --> 11:21.848
Every game does have its cheats.

11:32.792 --> 11:33.893
We did it.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.695
Finally...

11:36.296 --> 11:37.463
we got Sato.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.901
I can finally...

11:43.770 --> 11:45.038
go back to my old life!

11:46.172 --> 11:48.474
I did it, firefighter dude!

11:48.741 --> 11:50.143
[laughing]

11:57.150 --> 11:59.052
How can this be?

12:01.020 --> 12:04.257
You're unconscious,
how can your ghost...?

12:05.458 --> 12:06.492
[grunting]

12:32.352 --> 12:33.753
[laughs]

12:36.155 --> 12:37.323
[sighs]

12:42.161 --> 12:43.329
How...?

12:43.396 --> 12:45.365
It just comes down to practice.

12:46.265 --> 12:51.004
You're not the only one whose ghost
can move around on its own. Anyway...

12:51.504 --> 12:54.240
[ghost] Practice, practice, practice.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.143
It still doesn't have
much initiative though,

12:57.210 --> 12:59.278
so it's much easier to control it myself.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.247
Ghost!

13:06.052 --> 13:09.255
Maybe you got a little too cocky.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.325
-What are you doing?! Move!
-Do it.

13:17.263 --> 13:19.132
Wait! One more time!

13:22.101 --> 13:23.936
Come on! Ghost!

13:25.038 --> 13:28.007
Apparently, the ghost's actions
and its generation

13:28.074 --> 13:31.944
are changed somehow by the mental state
of the Ajin themselves.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.215
No way.

13:46.359 --> 13:50.029
Nagai!
Nagai! What are you doing here?!

13:54.967 --> 13:58.204
Apparently,
Nagai made some new friends, too.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.472
So, that means these guys...

13:59.539 --> 14:02.008
No wonder they don't look
like special forces!

14:02.408 --> 14:04.977
Getting in our way like that!

14:05.044 --> 14:06.312
[groaning]

14:08.281 --> 14:09.615
Man...

14:11.417 --> 14:15.054
You really are all... idiots!

14:15.121 --> 14:17.123
Huh? What was that?

14:19.559 --> 14:21.294
Why can't you see...?

14:23.029 --> 14:25.398
Sato's just playing around.

14:26.332 --> 14:29.602
He doesn't give a damn
about a future for Ajin.

14:38.177 --> 14:39.245
An IBM!

14:40.146 --> 14:41.514
Run! Now!

14:41.581 --> 14:46.919
[laughs] If they can't see ghosts,
then I guess your friends aren't Ajin?

14:54.260 --> 14:55.628
[gasping]

14:59.665 --> 15:00.666
So?

15:01.534 --> 15:04.203
How does it feel,
seeing people die because of you?

15:04.270 --> 15:07.440
Stop... Stop it... Please!

15:07.940 --> 15:09.041
Can't do that.

15:09.942 --> 15:12.245
This is your punishment
for getting in my way.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.981
Ghost... come on!

15:18.518 --> 15:21.187
Please... Please...

15:24.023 --> 15:25.024
Nagai...

15:27.927 --> 15:30.296
Come on!

15:34.400 --> 15:35.535
Nagai...

15:36.969 --> 15:38.304
It's okay.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.986
Nagai...

15:55.354 --> 15:59.525
If you want a quiet life,
I can give it to you.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.298
An eternal one, in darkness.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.145
The Ajin are upstairs!

16:19.212 --> 16:20.580
New objective! Neutralize them!

16:21.147 --> 16:22.348
Mr. Sato!

16:26.018 --> 16:27.687
This way! Hurry!

16:30.723 --> 16:31.657
Mr. Sato!

16:32.358 --> 16:34.193
Ah, a shame...

16:38.564 --> 16:39.532
[shouts]

17:08.761 --> 17:10.630
That was like a roller coaster.

17:11.697 --> 17:14.066
Or would you call it a free fall?

17:19.472 --> 17:20.606
This is...

17:22.542 --> 17:23.709
Kimura...

17:23.776 --> 17:27.747
We've secured an escape route. We can
get out to the utility conduit from there.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.285
And we got this, just like you said.

17:33.753 --> 17:38.357
How many times did those bastards kill me
to make these?!

17:45.298 --> 17:46.532
[panting]

17:48.067 --> 17:50.636
I was just working
on behalf of the nation.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.639
Weapons development is necessary
for national defense--

17:53.706 --> 17:54.574
Shut up!

17:56.242 --> 18:01.380
If you went through what I did,
you think you could say that?! Aah!

18:01.447 --> 18:03.282
Now, now, Tanaka, calm down.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.252
He still has an important role to play.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.294
You don't mean...?

18:15.728 --> 18:17.396
That's why you brought me here.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.533
We unlocked all the electronic locks
with the EMP,

18:21.300 --> 18:24.170
but we still don't have the physical key.

18:26.339 --> 18:30.409
I'm sure you always have it with you
since it's so important, right?

18:30.610 --> 18:31.811
[whimpering]

18:37.249 --> 18:38.551
There it is.

18:44.223 --> 18:47.360
Mr. Sato! He hadn't given
his testimony yet.

18:47.860 --> 18:51.163
-And what about Ajin civil rights?
-Tanaka.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.500
Rights aren't something
that somebody gives you.

18:55.267 --> 18:58.237
Rights are something you win
with your own hands.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.408
I believe JFK said that.

19:02.908 --> 19:05.544
Or maybe it was Martin Luther King.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.215
Maybe it wasn't either of them.
Anyway...

19:12.918 --> 19:17.923
Our true show of strength begins now.

19:36.175 --> 19:36.942
Damn it!

19:40.780 --> 19:41.781
Mr. Tosaki.

19:42.248 --> 19:44.316
[Tosaki] Nagai! Where is he?!

19:52.758 --> 19:57.763
It's too bad about the AASF, but we did
capture Kei Nagai and Ko Nakano.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.367
Apparently,
they were working with Sato.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.570
Their capture will help save
some face with the committee.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.907
Yeah, that's true.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.343
We'll start preparing
for a meeting now.

20:11.777 --> 20:15.948
I'd like your help, since you're a member
of the committee.

20:16.215 --> 20:16.982
Got it.

20:19.852 --> 20:20.986
[grunts]

20:21.420 --> 20:23.322
What are you...?

20:26.926 --> 20:27.993
Let's go.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.904
Is the mustache...?
I mean, that guy Manabe...?

20:42.575 --> 20:43.843
No...

20:45.411 --> 20:46.378
[grunts]

20:57.790 --> 20:59.558
TO BE CONTINUED

21:00.960 --> 21:03.996
[chorus singing]
<i>I'm tired of this one already, so</i>

21:04.263 --> 21:07.466
<i>I'll trade it</i>

21:07.533 --> 21:12.671
<i>For your ordinary one</i>

21:13.806 --> 21:20.012
<i>A shiny holy card</i>

21:20.312 --> 21:25.785
<i>For a grainy paper card</i>

21:26.585 --> 21:30.689
<i>You can see them all</i>

21:32.925 --> 21:37.463
<i>When you come to my house</i>

21:37.530 --> 21:43.569
<i>So</i>
<i>Two of us in the corner of the schoolyard</i>

21:43.636 --> 21:45.738
<i>While the wind blows</i>

21:45.805 --> 21:50.009
<i>I might be able to say it now</i>

21:52.311 --> 21:58.517
<i>Words I've never said to anyone</i>

21:58.584 --> 22:04.824
<i>"Won't you come and play, I'll be nice"</i>

22:04.890 --> 22:10.796
<i>"I'll give you anything, see"</i>

22:11.463 --> 22:14.033
<i>"Be my friend</i>

22:14.099 --> 22:20.940
<i>Always"</i>

22:32.952 --> 22:34.954
