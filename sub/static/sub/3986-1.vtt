WEBVTT

00:09.858 --> 00:10.858
You see now?

00:11.233 --> 00:12.654
I'm here to tell you,

00:13.251 --> 00:15.233
this remaining silent shit
ain't nothing like

00:15.486 --> 00:17.027
they make it out to be.

00:18.953 --> 00:21.225
You up in here
all tight with it,

00:21.827 --> 00:23.494
waiting for your paid lawyer,

00:24.556 --> 00:26.921
thinking you all wise,
ain't you?

00:28.296 --> 00:29.611
No. See,

00:31.000 --> 00:34.112
that worked when you some kind of
criminal mastermind...

00:35.081 --> 00:37.612
When you ain't been seen
runnin' from the deed.

00:38.689 --> 00:40.451
When your own fuckin'
running partner

00:40.624 --> 00:42.212
ain't in the next room,

00:42.896 --> 00:44.129
putting you in.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

00:56.158 --> 00:58.441
He's telling it
like a little bitch.

00:59.876 --> 01:02.727
We even went to mickey d's for him
because he was so motherfucking helpful.

01:04.937 --> 01:07.098
2 quarter pounders, big fries,

01:07.501 --> 01:09.635
McDonaldland cookies,

01:09.814 --> 01:11.140
Dr. Pepper.

01:11.501 --> 01:13.421
That's how your boy roll, right?

01:21.626 --> 01:23.277
All right.
Step out.

01:24.002 --> 01:26.122
- Where are we going?
- Break room.

01:26.455 --> 01:27.983
So you can enjoy that, huh?

01:28.317 --> 01:30.522
All right.
But I still ain't sayin' shit to you.

01:32.001 --> 01:33.316
Marnell, what the fuck?

01:42.356 --> 01:44.767
How many years you figure
we've been doing the same shit?

01:44.993 --> 01:46.083
20 at least.

01:49.595 --> 01:50.595
True.

01:52.221 --> 01:53.221
True.

01:55.220 --> 01:56.220
False.

01:56.876 --> 01:57.828
Load him up.

01:58.052 --> 01:59.872
- Some shit actually works, huh?
- Hell yeah.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.862
Americans are a stupid people,
by and large.

02:02.050 --> 02:04.585
We pretty much believe
whatever we're told.

02:10.181 --> 02:11.795
So it can feel my heart beat?

02:12.111 --> 02:13.145
Pulse? Yeah.

02:14.484 --> 02:16.390
If Marnell say
I had the gun, he lying.

02:17.948 --> 02:19.773
The machine tells the tale, son.

02:20.507 --> 02:21.596
We ready, professor?

02:23.725 --> 02:25.140
We'll start with an easy one.

02:25.814 --> 02:28.460
Is your name in fact
DeShawn Fredericks?

02:29.147 --> 02:30.146
Yeah.

02:36.768 --> 02:37.769
True.

02:38.394 --> 02:40.827
And do you reside in fact

02:41.611 --> 02:43.310
the 1200 block of woodyer street

02:43.552 --> 02:44.912
in west Baltimore?

02:45.170 --> 02:46.008
Yeah.

02:52.019 --> 02:53.803
- True.
- And did you and Marnell

02:53.971 --> 02:55.920
shoot your boy Pookie
down on Cary Street

02:56.109 --> 02:57.593
just like Marnell said you did?

02:57.945 --> 02:58.931
No. No.

03:07.707 --> 03:08.690
Lie.

03:08.850 --> 03:10.400
You lying motherfucker.

03:11.580 --> 03:13.214
Machine is never wrong, son.

03:14.984 --> 03:15.984
Fuck, man!

03:16.723 --> 03:19.200
Nigger can't never keep
his damn mouth shut.

03:19.513 --> 03:22.638
I should've busted a cap
in Pookie ass my own self.

03:23.169 --> 03:24.895
Left Marnell home and shit.

03:25.545 --> 03:27.025
He just a bitch, is all.

03:34.660 --> 03:36.119
The bigger the lie,

03:36.418 --> 03:37.992
the more they believe.

05:27.568 --> 05:29.200
First the BlackBerry.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.051
Oh, he brought his tunes.

05:32.839 --> 05:34.582
All the running shit
pay, don't it?

05:41.093 --> 05:43.333
We got one coming in.
Unidentified number-one male.

05:43.668 --> 05:46.340
<i>- You got him, Jimmy?
- Yeah. More face-to-face.</i>

05:51.125 --> 05:52.256
Oh, man.

05:52.439 --> 05:55.437
You know, this would be more fun
if we were actually getting paid.

05:56.149 --> 05:58.143
Hey, you know,
I heard a story about you,

05:58.465 --> 06:00.774
- when I was back in the west.
- It's not true.

06:01.474 --> 06:04.260
- Haven't even told it yet.
- Whatever it is, it's not true.

06:05.009 --> 06:07.190
You run a Vice undercover one time,

06:07.375 --> 06:10.160
and instead of pulling up,
you went ahead and closed the deal.

06:10.501 --> 06:12.672
I read this report where
you got blowed by this whore,

06:12.876 --> 06:14.803
and you actually wrote it
that you got blowed.

06:15.272 --> 06:16.753
You believe everything you read?

06:22.931 --> 06:23.931
Look, man.

06:24.929 --> 06:25.929
All I'm saying,

06:26.304 --> 06:29.354
if I'm gonna take your package,
split me and be fair.

06:29.742 --> 06:32.595
I got to pay all my people the same,
and here you're upping the price on me.

06:32.909 --> 06:35.238
- Pay your people less.
- They my people, though.

06:35.559 --> 06:36.845
Then short yourself.

06:38.207 --> 06:39.304
Split is 60/40.

06:39.679 --> 06:41.789
You want better?
You need to tool up.

06:42.019 --> 06:43.311
And wait for Chris, Snoop,

06:43.520 --> 06:45.718
and the rest of my people
come pay a call on your people.

06:45.902 --> 06:48.293
We will be brief
with all you motherfuckers.

06:48.924 --> 06:50.252
I think you know.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.121
All right.

07:15.993 --> 07:17.383
Northbound on Fulton.

07:18.361 --> 07:19.976
Lester. Coming your way.

07:26.490 --> 07:27.434
I see him.

07:27.932 --> 07:29.112
<i>Roger that.</i>

07:30.800 --> 07:32.597
Every day, same shit.

07:37.376 --> 07:39.759
- Look at this pretty bitch.
- Ten-hut!

07:46.735 --> 07:48.252
Just sit the fuck down.

07:48.626 --> 07:50.719
I'm not gonna stand up here
and pretend to be insulted

07:50.908 --> 07:52.940
because you all are pretending
to respect the rank.

07:53.149 --> 07:54.457
Today, he's an S.I.C.

07:54.673 --> 07:57.071
Tomorrow, he might be
a newly minted Lieutenant.

07:57.576 --> 08:00.612
You never know with these
career-minded motherfuckers, do you?

08:00.846 --> 08:03.293
If I was minding my career,
would I be in the western in command

08:03.460 --> 08:04.822
of you useless fucking humps?

08:06.573 --> 08:08.835
Okay, let's go to the readouts
and the warrants first.

08:09.014 --> 08:10.920
- Fuck the readouts.
- Fuck the warrants.

08:11.125 --> 08:12.999
What the fuck
is going on with our hours?

08:14.672 --> 08:17.069
Easy, easy. If I had an answer,
you'd have an answer.

08:17.304 --> 08:19.001
I'm in the same boat as you are.

08:19.345 --> 08:22.607
2-odd weeks since I've seen
overtime or court pay,

08:22.901 --> 08:24.704
and I gotta pay
the credit union,

08:24.931 --> 08:26.870
the archdiocese for my kid's tuition,

08:27.096 --> 08:29.086
and my ex-wife
so she can pay...

08:29.985 --> 08:33.158
Shut the fuck up
and sit the fuck down!

08:33.861 --> 08:35.350
In your fucking seats.

08:39.409 --> 08:40.874
We're still authorizing overtime

08:41.063 --> 08:43.254
and the state's attorneys
are still signing court slips.

08:43.421 --> 08:44.856
But you ain't fucking paying us.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.989
The union says
we're going down to the NLRB

08:47.304 --> 08:49.441
- and deal with this shit.
- Word coming down

08:49.666 --> 08:52.071
is that when the city's budget
situation is improved,

08:52.238 --> 08:54.302
we'll all see that
as back pay or comp time.

08:54.472 --> 08:56.577
- Every last hour.
- Back pay my ass.

08:57.063 --> 08:58.686
This shit here is just paper.

08:59.474 --> 09:02.435
65 hours of worthless paper
right here!

09:02.800 --> 09:04.664
Officer brown, sit your ass.

09:07.109 --> 09:08.109
Sit!

09:19.547 --> 09:21.111
We're all professionals.

09:21.866 --> 09:23.810
We're about to police
the roughest district

09:23.978 --> 09:25.925
in one of the roughest cities
in the world.

09:26.795 --> 09:28.102
Show some pride.

09:29.765 --> 09:32.383
If promises were made,
promises will be kept.

09:33.044 --> 09:34.971
The situation in the city
right now is bad,

09:35.670 --> 09:37.070
but it won't stay bad forever.

09:37.430 --> 09:40.659
We wait this out
like professionals.

09:43.982 --> 09:44.983
Now, then.

09:45.732 --> 09:47.110
Back to the readouts.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.435
First item is from motor pool.

09:54.982 --> 09:57.707
No marked or unmarked units
can be shopped on dickman street

09:58.063 --> 10:00.136
- until further notice.
- What?

10:00.374 --> 10:02.892
Cutbacks and fleet budgeting
require that all districts

10:03.123 --> 10:05.547
make do with vehicles
in their current state of affairs.

10:05.794 --> 10:06.911
So that means--

10:08.480 --> 10:10.279
Shitbox cars
are falling apart.

10:10.578 --> 10:11.898
Fucking know that?

10:24.529 --> 10:25.605
<i>Where you at?</i>

10:26.295 --> 10:27.351
<i>On his ass.</i>

10:30.472 --> 10:31.748
You guys got the eyeball.

10:32.175 --> 10:33.307
<i>All good, Lester.</i>

10:33.672 --> 10:34.747
<i>It's all good.</i>

10:41.918 --> 10:43.776
<i>Officer castor,
you have a call on line 79...</i>

10:43.986 --> 10:45.766
- Natives are restless, huh?
- I don't know

10:45.929 --> 10:48.018
how long we go before
the wheels fall off the car.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.824
A year ago, they were promised
pay raises, pension bumps,

10:51.026 --> 10:52.659
better equipment, better cars.

10:52.879 --> 10:54.371
Now we can't even pay the o.t.

10:54.594 --> 10:56.311
Gave them
the professionalism bit, right?

10:56.563 --> 10:58.300
In the real world,
they pay professionals.

10:58.466 --> 11:00.720
- That's why we call them pros.
- Major.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.170
There's a problem on the back lot.

11:04.982 --> 11:06.531
If it bothers you, clean them up.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.532
- Fuck you, son.
- Fuck you right back.

11:08.824 --> 11:10.973
That thing was all fucked up
when I got it for midnight.

11:11.161 --> 11:12.808
- You ask anyone.
- Then, you clean it,

11:12.975 --> 11:14.761
or you get the midnight shift
to clean it.

11:14.933 --> 11:16.116
Clean this.

11:16.556 --> 11:19.488
Fuck you, Gene. You don't leave it
like that for the next man.

11:19.852 --> 11:22.491
You're the one
whining like a little bitch, Bobby.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.855
As S.I.C., should I stop this?

11:32.482 --> 11:33.663
That's my car.

11:35.538 --> 11:38.121
What, you think this is
good for morale or something?

11:38.745 --> 11:41.616
These guys haven't had
an honest paycheck in weeks.

11:42.479 --> 11:44.655
We have no fucking morale, Sergeant.

11:56.862 --> 11:59.228
Kid ran us around for half an hour.

11:59.603 --> 12:01.060
Amazing, ain't it?

12:04.526 --> 12:05.603
Here we go.

12:17.102 --> 12:18.208
He got a meeting.

12:18.453 --> 12:19.435
Want me to come?

12:20.232 --> 12:22.783
You go check on your corner.
I'll send word if it's on.

12:35.647 --> 12:37.211
- He's moving.
- All right.

12:44.425 --> 12:45.891
<i>Lester, are you there?</i>

12:47.601 --> 12:49.058
Up on Reisterstown with Chris.

12:49.397 --> 12:50.591
Marlo's on the move.

12:52.356 --> 12:53.550
Should we follow him?

12:53.853 --> 12:56.632
Why?
We know where he's going.

13:01.229 --> 13:03.273
No, sir.
We've cut it to the bone already.

13:03.481 --> 13:05.432
Cars are gonna go in service
for the next month.

13:05.642 --> 13:07.515
And for as long as
we can get away with it,

13:07.735 --> 13:09.515
we're deferring all overtime
and court pay.

13:09.712 --> 13:11.556
How's crime?
How are your stats?

13:12.080 --> 13:15.691
It's a double-digit decline you wanted.
Not possible with these cuts.

13:16.021 --> 13:18.336
For God sake, you got to
show us some kind of reduction.

13:18.957 --> 13:20.127
I campaigned on that.

13:20.380 --> 13:21.678
All this deferred overtime.

13:21.877 --> 13:24.784
We'll pay it as we can.
And the pay raises I promised?

13:25.247 --> 13:26.985
They're still coming,
just a year late.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.832
Right now I got to throw
every dollar at the schools,

13:30.146 --> 13:33.163
but you tell your people
I know I made promises.

13:33.652 --> 13:35.274
Where else can you guys trim?

13:37.081 --> 13:38.157
Well, we...

13:38.945 --> 13:41.667
We've been running
a prolonged investigation...

13:42.203 --> 13:43.519
into all the--

13:43.776 --> 13:46.185
the bodies we pulled out
of those houses last year.

13:46.378 --> 13:47.624
Months of surveillance.

13:47.784 --> 13:48.977
Thousands of man-hours.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.738
At this point,
we're not close to an arrest.

13:51.948 --> 13:53.965
You're saying you want us
to come down on a case

13:54.196 --> 13:55.808
in which 22 people were murdered

13:55.997 --> 13:57.525
and left to rot in city houses?

13:57.777 --> 14:00.004
We caught national news coverage
on those murders.

14:00.192 --> 14:01.201
Last year.

14:01.483 --> 14:04.090
I don't want anyone saying
we're giving up on those murders.

14:04.380 --> 14:05.889
I don't want to see that headline.

14:06.078 --> 14:08.591
But given our fiscal situation,
we could...

14:09.261 --> 14:11.772
temporarily suspend the investigation

14:12.304 --> 14:13.644
pending new developments.

14:17.018 --> 14:19.082
- Anything else?
- We need to take away

14:19.304 --> 14:21.565
the 10-hour cap
on secondary employment.

14:21.767 --> 14:24.818
You do that and your police
aren't doing police work,

14:25.034 --> 14:28.599
they're guarding liquor stores,
bouncing nightclubs, putting up drywall.

14:28.924 --> 14:31.082
Respectfully,
morale is at rock bottom.

14:31.487 --> 14:33.182
You need to throw
our people a bone.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.848
Or you could lose them for good.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.379
Hold the line now...

14:44.698 --> 14:47.207
And we'll get to a better place.
I promise.

14:59.647 --> 15:00.849
Say it, Norman.

15:01.393 --> 15:02.713
You're thinking it.

15:03.774 --> 15:05.542
Truth to power, Norman.

15:05.897 --> 15:07.592
Isn't that
what I keep you around for?

15:08.215 --> 15:10.752
When the governor threw
that 50-some million on the table,

15:10.951 --> 15:13.391
- you should've picked that shit up.
- He takes the state bailout

15:13.713 --> 15:15.510
- and he never becomes governor.
- He shorts

15:15.699 --> 15:17.625
the police department,
the crime rate stays up,

15:17.814 --> 15:19.322
he ain't no governor, neither,

15:19.531 --> 15:22.002
just a weak-ass Mayor
of a broke-ass city.

15:24.210 --> 15:25.110
Feel better?

15:25.394 --> 15:27.529
A little bit.
You?

15:46.878 --> 15:48.141
Boy folded it up.

15:49.380 --> 15:50.989
He taking our shit 60/40.

15:53.089 --> 15:55.022
- Nigger showed no heart at all.
- So more people

15:55.318 --> 15:57.812
- could stand down there, right?
- Definitely.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.471
Won't be needing no drama
behind his nonsense.

16:01.112 --> 16:02.745
And po-po's still up on you, huh?

16:02.955 --> 16:04.663
You are hot all the time, man.

16:05.655 --> 16:07.953
Today they got the white boy
with black hair up on the roof

16:08.203 --> 16:09.482
on Booker T. Washington.

16:10.155 --> 16:11.818
Watching with his spyglass.

16:13.748 --> 16:16.094
The young 'uns
saw him climbing up. Yeah.

16:17.156 --> 16:18.544
So we do like this, then.

16:34.344 --> 16:35.344
That's it.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.770
All of that so he could
swap a few words.

16:39.467 --> 16:41.031
How do you wiretap that?

16:41.780 --> 16:42.616
Lester?

16:42.931 --> 16:44.313
Are we done for the day, man?

16:44.568 --> 16:46.749
<i>You don't want to stay on Chris,
see where he goes next?</i>

16:48.442 --> 16:50.000
We've been on this guy for months.

16:50.252 --> 16:53.285
- He doesn't slip.
- And no one's kicking our O.T.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.282
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:57.279 --> 16:58.279
<i>We're done.</i>

16:58.715 --> 16:59.715
Copy that.

17:01.468 --> 17:03.041
Greenhouse Gas right here.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.430
Hey, Marcus,
you got a count for me?

17:10.203 --> 17:12.958
- Spider, you got a count for me?
- For you? No.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.021
How we do?

17:23.529 --> 17:24.844
I can't say for sure.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.041
They short, huh?

17:29.653 --> 17:31.237
Man, I just know they ain't tell me.

17:36.282 --> 17:37.464
Greenhouse Gas.

17:39.925 --> 17:40.858
Go home, man.

17:41.215 --> 17:43.339
Bug'll be out of school pretty soon.

17:43.686 --> 17:44.983
I ain't you, Michael.

17:45.973 --> 17:46.973
Go get Bug.

17:47.282 --> 17:48.386
I'll see you tonight.

17:55.907 --> 17:57.193
Greenhouse Gas right here.

17:58.201 --> 17:59.200
Yo, we short?

17:59.452 --> 18:02.891
No, we good.
Got 60 left from about 1,400.

18:03.138 --> 18:04.138
We own it, Mike.

18:04.825 --> 18:06.275
So why don't you tell Duke?

18:06.841 --> 18:08.495
Why you fucking with Duke, nigger?

18:08.989 --> 18:10.613
I ain't fucking with nobody, man.

18:10.844 --> 18:12.917
He just acting like a bitch,
that's all.

18:15.099 --> 18:16.577
Greenhouse Gas is hot.

18:27.782 --> 18:29.723
They're getting a little sloppy.

18:30.096 --> 18:31.708
Did that meet in the same lot

18:32.031 --> 18:33.852
they've used twice
in the last week.

18:34.057 --> 18:35.310
The one on McCulloh.

18:35.582 --> 18:38.451
That's pretty thin considering
how long we've been on these guys.

18:39.945 --> 18:41.537
They're gonna get lazy.

18:42.027 --> 18:43.475
Fall into a pattern.

18:44.339 --> 18:45.625
They all do, over time.

18:46.340 --> 18:47.489
Someone say overtime?

18:47.649 --> 18:50.313
Seriously, we did 14 hours
and we're only gonna get paid for 8.

18:50.595 --> 18:51.790
Case has gotta go green

18:52.062 --> 18:54.029
before they go black.
That's how I was taught.

18:55.254 --> 18:56.781
180 hours and counting.

18:57.191 --> 18:59.130
Couple more weeks
and you get a month's work.

18:59.339 --> 19:03.095
Couple more weeks, I'll be in jail
for late payment of child support.

19:05.851 --> 19:07.213
Who needs a taste?

19:07.659 --> 19:09.453
Shit.
Who's buying, motherfucker?

19:09.761 --> 19:11.131
I'll cover a round or two.

19:11.557 --> 19:13.589
Then I guess I'm drinking
a round or two.

19:14.838 --> 19:16.522
Oh, yeah, and a boat dock, huh?

19:16.834 --> 19:20.117
Yeah. And the gazebo here?
For my wife.

19:22.075 --> 19:23.549
You get any word from downtown

19:23.726 --> 19:25.850
on when they're gonna start
paying out the O.T. again?

19:26.019 --> 19:28.405
Because we going double shift
on these surveillances.

19:28.650 --> 19:30.299
They haven't told me anything.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.619
Guess I ain't in the loop.

19:37.782 --> 19:39.268
They have to shut it down, Colonel.

19:39.541 --> 19:41.835
Explain to me how we come up
on 22 bodies.

19:42.086 --> 19:44.621
- Explain that to me.
- This comes straight from the hall.

19:44.825 --> 19:47.616
You're talking about a year's worth
of work by my best people.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.381
To just give up on all of that?

19:49.575 --> 19:52.653
Colonel, we haven't made
an honest payroll in over a month.

19:52.972 --> 19:54.564
Where the fuck is Carcetti?

19:54.838 --> 19:56.269
The man promised us a new day.

19:56.453 --> 19:58.198
He's tangled up
with the schools,

19:58.725 --> 20:00.102
and we're on hold.

20:02.596 --> 20:04.659
The Mayor's made a few
commitments to me personally.

20:04.833 --> 20:07.249
If you want to call in a martyr
on behalf of this department,

20:08.003 --> 20:09.909
- feel free.
- And while you're at it,

20:10.528 --> 20:12.455
see if you can get
your take-home car back.

20:13.085 --> 20:14.815
Budget officer called an hour ago

20:15.247 --> 20:18.451
telling us to relieve colonels and below
of take-home vehicles.

20:33.847 --> 20:36.386
Hold on. Hold on.
See, if you move it here,

20:36.678 --> 20:37.964
then I got you.

20:41.735 --> 20:43.514
Little man bringing it.

20:47.942 --> 20:48.976
Yo, dude...

20:51.166 --> 20:52.531
I've been thinking.

20:53.288 --> 20:55.911
You ain't need to put in time
on the corner if you don't want to.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.998
I mean, you're doing enough here
with Bug to get paid.

20:59.589 --> 21:00.665
How you mean?

21:01.287 --> 21:03.338
I'm saying
looking out for him,

21:04.850 --> 21:07.048
and I've been thinking, like,

21:07.265 --> 21:09.086
if you were to get locked up
for some shit,

21:09.912 --> 21:11.423
how'd it be for Bug, you know?

21:13.973 --> 21:16.151
So, who's gonna watch
your corner in the morning?

21:17.666 --> 21:19.617
Thought I might
promote Spider,

21:20.035 --> 21:22.089
see how he doing
for a week or so.

21:23.918 --> 21:25.683
So, I'd be like a nanny and shit?

21:27.120 --> 21:29.619
What am I gonna do before Bug
get home from school,

21:29.944 --> 21:31.660
clean the stove
and bake some cookies?

21:33.863 --> 21:35.329
Do what you want here, yo.

21:35.929 --> 21:37.542
Before he get home,
time is your own.

21:44.596 --> 21:45.601
You beat me.

21:46.729 --> 21:49.242
Oh, snap, you beat me.

21:53.166 --> 21:55.627
They're fucking liars,
motherfucking liars.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.065
Easy, boy.

21:58.344 --> 22:00.459
I was happy on patrol.
I was fine.

22:01.114 --> 22:02.183
You were bored.

22:02.468 --> 22:03.828
Fuck no. I was happy.

22:06.089 --> 22:08.126
Motherfuckers come to me and say,

22:08.815 --> 22:10.078
"it's a new day, Jimmy,"

22:10.559 --> 22:12.339
talking shit about
how it was gonna change.

22:12.617 --> 22:14.010
Shit never fucking changes.

22:14.366 --> 22:17.255
If they had left me up and running
when Marlo was on them cell phones,

22:17.464 --> 22:18.878
I'd have had him a year ago.

22:19.099 --> 22:20.082
See?

22:20.770 --> 22:23.305
But they can't do the right thing.
It ain't in them.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.953
Now we're back on Marlo's ass.
We need to be on him 24/7.

22:27.226 --> 22:28.880
The motherfuckers cut our overtime,

22:29.041 --> 22:31.065
and they shopped
our best surveillance van.

22:31.395 --> 22:33.373
Don't even think about trying to...

22:33.806 --> 22:35.599
requisition a new fucking

22:35.928 --> 22:38.678
- digital camera.
- They want to do it on the cheap.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.774
Bunko on the prowl.

22:41.084 --> 22:43.220
Hey, bunky Bunk,
come here!

22:43.690 --> 22:46.239
- Jimmy.
- Come here, you virile beast.

22:46.611 --> 22:47.616
Hey, you...

22:48.672 --> 22:49.991
Buy me a drink, you whore.

22:50.254 --> 22:51.447
With what?

22:56.064 --> 22:57.404
I'd have thought the bosses

22:57.703 --> 23:00.141
would've at least figured out
how to keep paying Homicide.

23:01.388 --> 23:02.393
Pete, come on.

23:02.871 --> 23:04.087
Take these slips off me.

23:04.290 --> 23:06.583
I'll pay you 50 cents
on the dollar against my tab.

23:06.859 --> 23:08.388
- Cash only.
- When we get paid,

23:08.600 --> 23:10.443
- you double your money.
- City's never gonna

23:10.682 --> 23:12.587
be healthy enough
to go all that back pay.

23:12.902 --> 23:14.742
How the fuck
are we gonna pay the bar tab?

23:14.921 --> 23:16.975
We could always
knock off a liquor store--

23:17.338 --> 23:19.160
G & L on Edmondson, thin plexi.

23:19.511 --> 23:21.067
I'll take out the counter man.

23:22.026 --> 23:24.565
- I'll cover you.
- I got the door, no problem.

23:26.276 --> 23:28.254
Who's gonna be our wheel man?

23:36.484 --> 23:38.851
Every plan, a weak link.

23:40.465 --> 23:42.360
I heard they're closing
the foreign bureaus--

23:42.559 --> 23:44.239
Joburg, Beijing, everything.

23:44.730 --> 23:46.747
I heard layoffs
as bad as in Philly.

23:47.019 --> 23:48.674
Bullshit.
They're not gonna lay off.

23:48.967 --> 23:50.307
They'll offer buyouts first.

23:50.543 --> 23:53.106
If they don't get enough of those,
they'll go right to layoffs. Watch.

23:53.274 --> 23:55.641
What the fuck you care?
You got all the seniority in the world.

23:55.818 --> 23:57.667
Be a shame
if they have to get rid of all them

23:57.834 --> 24:00.564
- twentysomethings in the newsroom.
- Degenerate motherfucker.

24:02.406 --> 24:05.400
Kleppner sure do like to hire
them sweet, young things, don't he?

24:05.593 --> 24:07.959
23, 24 years old; model-thin;

24:08.312 --> 24:10.703
long, straight hair;
and big, traffic-light eyes.

24:11.137 --> 24:13.225
And half of them can
write a lick, can they?

24:13.491 --> 24:15.712
Yeah. Our esteemed
managing editor

24:16.329 --> 24:18.223
certainly does favor
a certain type, don't he?

24:19.918 --> 24:20.848
Gentlemen...

24:21.480 --> 24:22.480
Question mark.

24:25.980 --> 24:27.082
Someday...

24:27.522 --> 24:31.036
I want to find out what it feels like
to work for a real newspaper.

24:50.366 --> 24:52.769
What? I've got calls out.
You start writing now,

24:53.059 --> 24:55.651
and I'm not here 10:00 tonight
reworking your lead.

24:55.974 --> 24:57.858
- Reworking my lead?
- Come on, Fletch.

24:58.192 --> 25:00.342
Try to make the e-dot deadline
for once in your life.

25:02.228 --> 25:04.361
- Any matter for the council meeting?
- Yeah.

25:04.812 --> 25:07.310
I'll top it with whatever smells fresh,
make the double-dot.

25:07.663 --> 25:09.649
They're gonna vote
on a homeless ordinance, right?

25:09.817 --> 25:11.692
Maybe not.
Naresse is making noises

25:11.876 --> 25:14.160
like she might
throw it back to committee.

25:14.936 --> 25:17.479
Yeah? Well, find me
some news somewhere.

25:19.108 --> 25:20.218
North Avenue?

25:23.420 --> 25:24.853
Something is burning.

25:26.420 --> 25:27.346
You...

25:28.372 --> 25:29.752
You wonder what it might be?

25:30.043 --> 25:31.685
I'm not the police reporter.

25:32.443 --> 25:34.370
But you called Twig, though, right?

25:39.417 --> 25:41.725
At least he's a columnist.
He's paid to sit on his ass.

25:41.914 --> 25:43.815
What's your excuse?
Just left him in

25:44.003 --> 25:45.706
the smoking lounge.
Hit him on his cell.

25:45.915 --> 25:48.575
What kind of people
stand around watching a fire?

25:49.042 --> 25:50.889
Some shameful shit right here.

25:53.255 --> 25:56.108
Where else would you rather be,
huh, kids?

25:58.995 --> 26:00.070
I got it, sir.

26:10.408 --> 26:11.330
Hey, Jay.

26:12.582 --> 26:15.280
A.P. Has got something on more
cutbacks in city bus lines.

26:15.649 --> 26:17.366
<i>- You don't say.
- Daily Record</i>

26:17.638 --> 26:19.791
had it this morning,
MTA trial balloon.

26:20.293 --> 26:21.683
State desk is covering.

26:22.716 --> 26:23.638
<i>Daily Record.</i>

26:24.063 --> 26:26.117
All right, people.
It's 2:00.

26:26.479 --> 26:28.502
I need budget lines in case
anybody is threatening

26:28.677 --> 26:30.303
to commit and act of daily journalism.

26:35.266 --> 26:36.350
City desk. Haynes.

26:37.709 --> 26:38.993
You didn't, huh?

26:39.244 --> 26:42.021
What the fuck are we supposed
to do for centerpiece art?

26:42.953 --> 26:44.322
Great. Wonderful.

26:46.562 --> 26:48.447
Photo didn't get out
for the racetrack piece.

26:48.660 --> 26:51.096
What about art for the Hopkins
press conference? Did we get that?

26:51.368 --> 26:52.844
Scratched it for racetrack.

26:53.033 --> 26:54.290
Hey, Swag, it's me again.

26:54.858 --> 26:57.026
Something is on fire
over in east Baltimore.

26:57.334 --> 26:59.532
Surprise me with a nice,
pretty picture, huh?

27:00.015 --> 27:02.902
Look.
What we have is drug violence

27:03.091 --> 27:04.537
and plenty of it.
What you have

27:04.818 --> 27:08.219
is federal gun statutes that come
with a 5-year minimum, no parole, and,

27:08.722 --> 27:10.382
we need to lower our murder rate.

27:10.603 --> 27:13.200
Especially since you shorted
your police department budget.

27:13.408 --> 27:15.606
It's no secret
we have budget problems,

27:15.881 --> 27:18.264
all the more reason
for the U.S. Attorney to pitch in.

27:18.519 --> 27:20.990
Officially, my priorities
are counterterrorism

27:21.158 --> 27:22.385
and political corruption.

27:22.615 --> 27:24.318
So you told me
when I asked you for help

27:24.546 --> 27:26.367
on those bodies
in the vacant houses.

27:26.659 --> 27:29.704
But I'm inclined to provide you
with a dozen FBI agents

27:29.911 --> 27:32.825
and all the wherewithal
they need to work that case,

27:33.384 --> 27:35.854
but we want Clay Davis
to go federal.

27:36.959 --> 27:38.878
Our state's attorney
has developed that case.

27:39.234 --> 27:40.867
He decides what to do with it.

27:41.309 --> 27:44.261
He seems inclined to keep
Mr. Davis local at this point,

27:44.849 --> 27:47.648
but if you could convince
Mr. Bond to reconsider,

27:47.836 --> 27:49.449
we might find the resources

27:49.658 --> 27:51.554
not only for the probe
of the row house bodies,

27:51.742 --> 27:53.795
but the time to run
some of those gun cases for you.

27:54.108 --> 27:56.858
But unless you get Clay Davis, you're
willing to let the killing continue.

27:57.192 --> 27:59.641
Look. The FBI
and the U.S. Attorney's office

27:59.845 --> 28:02.870
are not here to do the job
that your police department can't.

28:03.157 --> 28:04.831
Don't blame us
for your ineffectiveness.

28:05.031 --> 28:07.205
Baltimore is knee deep in blood.
Unless this guy can hang

28:07.406 --> 28:08.914
a democratic legislator,

28:09.410 --> 28:12.327
- he couldn't give a damn.
- And to protect that legislator,

28:12.642 --> 28:14.380
who happens to be
one of the most corrupt

28:14.589 --> 28:16.349
extortion artists in the state,

28:16.611 --> 28:18.034
you'll burn every last bridge.

28:18.286 --> 28:21.260
Do you think I give a shit about
Clay Davis? I am not protecting him.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.527
- Then give him up.
- It's Bond's call.

28:23.779 --> 28:25.118
- Talk to him.
- I have.

28:25.338 --> 28:27.798
And he told your Republican
ass to go fuck itself, huh?

28:28.027 --> 28:30.203
Well, let me double down on that.

28:39.244 --> 28:41.296
Good luck with your crime problem.

28:48.503 --> 28:49.578
That go well?

28:50.203 --> 28:52.755
You know why he wants
the Clay Davis investigation so bad?

28:53.143 --> 28:55.000
So he can stomp all over
the Democratic party

28:55.305 --> 28:58.528
and help give his asshole
Republican golf buddy another 4 years

28:58.856 --> 29:00.909
- in the Governor's mansion.
- So, Bond

29:01.161 --> 29:03.346
is keeping the case local
to help the party, huh?

29:03.689 --> 29:04.631
No.

29:05.095 --> 29:07.781
Bond is keeping the case so that
Clay Davis can be a trophy for bond.

29:08.193 --> 29:10.441
My guess is, our newly elected
state's attorney

29:10.735 --> 29:12.274
wants to, one day, run for Mayor.

29:12.567 --> 29:14.216
Cuts both ways
for you, Naresse.

29:14.549 --> 29:17.859
If the feds get Clay Davis, then
the case doesn't give bond any profile,

29:18.236 --> 29:20.197
but if they get him
and flip him,

29:20.770 --> 29:23.037
Clay might take
half the Royce administration with him.

29:23.436 --> 29:25.050
You included maybe.

29:27.148 --> 29:28.519
Don't you worry about me.

29:28.904 --> 29:31.172
You, on the other hand,
just slammed the door on the feds,

29:31.373 --> 29:32.960
and we need all the help we can get.

29:35.962 --> 29:37.164
That's on them.

29:49.460 --> 29:50.459
Pussy call.

29:51.062 --> 29:53.263
I'm just glad to know
Marlo has a hobby.

29:55.997 --> 29:57.924
Here.
Take her to her room,

29:59.084 --> 30:02.169
you know,
let her hit the mini bar, watch tv.

30:03.019 --> 30:05.798
When she's settled,
go take care of the other thing.

30:06.427 --> 30:07.956
I use Monk for my ride.

30:13.515 --> 30:15.480
All right. Then moving on
to new business,

30:16.407 --> 30:18.213
with John Hopkins
buying up everything

30:18.495 --> 30:20.859
north of Monument Street
and tearing the shit down,

30:21.372 --> 30:24.298
I think we all see the writing
on the wall in East Baltimore.

30:24.537 --> 30:26.221
Yeah. They moving the 'hood out.

30:27.312 --> 30:29.766
Niggers are going across
the line to Baltimore County.

30:29.996 --> 30:32.554
Pretty soon, East Baltimore
won't be in Essex.

30:32.861 --> 30:36.206
There's a market already along route 40
and down at Turner Station.

30:36.506 --> 30:39.397
- And new territory go to who claim it.
- No. Ordinarily so,

30:40.130 --> 30:43.214
but here, we got some of our
east side people being displaced, right?

30:43.975 --> 30:46.718
I think we need to take care
of those most affected.

30:47.642 --> 30:48.732
Meaning you.

30:51.718 --> 30:54.532
Well, I am east side,

30:55.044 --> 30:56.294
for the most part,

30:56.840 --> 31:00.080
but I'm talking about Hungry Man
and Parker and Ghost,

31:00.456 --> 31:02.759
you know,
others beside myself.

31:03.681 --> 31:06.552
Hopkins ain't gonna affect
your market share, Marlo,

31:07.778 --> 31:10.341
- so for those of us who suffer--
- All right. I see that.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.674
Won't you let one
of your juniors get a shot

31:12.954 --> 31:14.186
to open the county up?

31:14.375 --> 31:15.862
Let a fresh face get a shot at it.

31:16.186 --> 31:17.620
No disrespect, son,

31:17.790 --> 31:21.129
but how I delegate to my lieutenants
is not a co-op concern.

31:23.621 --> 31:25.725
Yeah, but how Slim feel
about that, though?

31:26.909 --> 31:28.167
How you feel, tall man?

31:28.828 --> 31:30.348
Ready to pioneer out there for us?

31:30.744 --> 31:32.400
Naw. I'm good where I am.

31:33.026 --> 31:34.093
Marlo, man,

31:35.188 --> 31:36.675
you're a little out of order here.

31:36.927 --> 31:38.057
Yeah. Well,

31:38.683 --> 31:40.610
- it's just a thought.
- Look, man.

31:40.963 --> 31:43.566
- What's the percentage breakdown...
- Don't sleep on Marlo.

31:44.550 --> 31:46.038
He up to some shit here.

31:46.412 --> 31:48.502
That puts me out 8 corners at least.

31:48.890 --> 31:50.812
Hungry Man,
that was some prime real estate.

31:51.377 --> 31:53.913
It took me 6 years
to build up them corners.

32:16.282 --> 32:17.283
Reginald.

32:22.034 --> 32:23.034
Reginald.

32:30.290 --> 32:33.220
I'm going to work. You know
I got night shift all this week.

32:33.835 --> 32:37.500
You know if you stay down here
quiet like, you ain't need to sweat.

32:37.890 --> 32:40.787
You don't stay here
when I'm not around. That's our rule.

32:42.681 --> 32:45.047
I'm your brother, right?
I got nowhere to go when I leave here.

32:45.215 --> 32:46.931
Last time I left you
alone in my home,

32:47.140 --> 32:49.047
you dragged half my kitchen
to a pawn shop.

32:49.345 --> 32:50.420
Remember that?

32:53.158 --> 32:55.020
But you can keep
the door locked, right?

32:55.293 --> 32:56.464
I'm down here.

32:57.821 --> 32:58.826
My rules.

33:00.187 --> 33:01.109
You said.

33:40.508 --> 33:42.640
The courthouse?
What the fuck?

33:43.032 --> 33:44.032
I'll go in.

33:45.528 --> 33:46.529
Rupert.

33:49.781 --> 33:50.781
What now?

33:51.622 --> 33:53.298
Major Crimes is being disbanded.

33:53.578 --> 33:55.718
The detectives return
to regular rotation.

33:55.905 --> 33:57.680
I got the word yesterday
from command.

33:57.943 --> 33:59.346
The Mayor signed off.

33:59.531 --> 34:02.231
They're quietly deep-sixing
the investigation into the bodies

34:02.401 --> 34:03.596
and to Marlo Stanfield.

34:03.827 --> 34:05.999
- A money thing?
- They're pulling back on everything--

34:06.230 --> 34:08.804
Man hours, equipment,
lab work, motor pool.

34:09.331 --> 34:10.683
Every last dollar we can find

34:10.850 --> 34:12.789
is being shipped over
to plug the school budget.

34:13.018 --> 34:15.197
Cedric thought he would try
to reason with Carcetti,

34:15.398 --> 34:18.001
maybe see if we can keep
the Stanfield detail, at least.

34:18.205 --> 34:20.529
Wait. What about Clay Davis?
That's going to grand jury soon.

34:20.706 --> 34:23.918
If they ship Freamon back to homicide,
I don't have him on that, either,

34:24.130 --> 34:26.833
- and Lester pretty much is that case.
- Excuse me.

34:27.101 --> 34:29.533
- You know where the clerk's office at?
- Criminal or civil?

34:29.885 --> 34:31.183
Criminal, definitely.

34:31.657 --> 34:32.975
End of the hall, last door.

34:37.331 --> 34:39.523
- When are you meeting with the Mayor?
- About an hour.

34:39.876 --> 34:41.842
They gave me a few minutes
on the end of his day.

34:42.204 --> 34:43.447
I'll go with you.

34:43.827 --> 34:45.480
Come by my office and get me.

34:49.706 --> 34:51.188
So, where you off to now?

34:51.484 --> 34:53.367
Motions hearing in part 18.

34:54.139 --> 34:56.081
It's the last thing on my sched.

35:02.670 --> 35:03.786
And for state desk?

35:03.982 --> 35:06.929
Additional cutbacks are said
to be coming in the city MTA routes,

35:07.258 --> 35:08.704
trail balloon from the governor.

35:09.196 --> 35:11.224
- Affects a lot of people, no?
- If it happens.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.133
- They floated this once before.
- Still,

35:13.448 --> 35:16.001
we can go outside
and give them the potential impact.

35:18.281 --> 35:20.815
<i>The truth is we're following
the Daily Record on this one.</i>

35:22.327 --> 35:24.650
Why don't we have that?
If it's a trial balloon--

35:24.860 --> 35:27.499
We've been without a transport reporter
since the last round of buyouts,

35:27.728 --> 35:29.177
- so--
- We should pick that up.

35:29.491 --> 35:31.062
- Probably so, but--
- Just because

35:31.357 --> 35:34.090
Chicago does a little belt-tightening,
there's no reason for us to fall down.

35:34.426 --> 35:35.598
Their cutbacks there

35:35.828 --> 35:38.131
shouldn't affect our ability
to put out an excellent product.

35:38.361 --> 35:39.848
Simply have to do more with less.

35:40.031 --> 35:42.203
<i>Certainly, we have more resources
than the Daily Record.</i>

35:42.568 --> 35:44.286
Though not a transport reporter.

35:47.335 --> 35:48.591
Your Eminence,

35:48.958 --> 35:50.508
slumming at the Metro meeting today?

35:51.075 --> 35:52.952
- What do you know?
- City desk.

35:53.426 --> 35:55.298
State's attorney
complains about the decline

35:55.468 --> 35:57.069
in quality police case work 20 inches

35:57.363 --> 35:59.317
from warm castle.
Got the city council tonight.

35:59.526 --> 36:01.572
Probably won't get a vote
on the homeless initiative,

36:01.740 --> 36:03.591
but we'll scratch some news
out of it somehow.

36:03.842 --> 36:07.012
Two-car fatal on the Beltway,
two overnight murders in the city,

36:07.328 --> 36:11.046
and a fire ongoing
in a Baltimore city row house

36:11.255 --> 36:13.097
for which we may
or may not have art.

36:13.355 --> 36:14.389
Regional affairs.

36:14.639 --> 36:17.113
We have the Hopkins piece on biomed,
though

36:17.365 --> 36:19.892
I'm told we didn't get
art on today's press conference,

36:20.137 --> 36:21.418
and we have 15 inches

36:21.586 --> 36:23.547
from the college park stringer
on U.M.

36:23.787 --> 36:26.037
- not making it's deseg goals again.
- I'm told that,

36:26.373 --> 36:30.257
numbers aside, the campus has become
much more hospitable to minorities.

36:30.467 --> 36:32.410
I'm told that things
have changed for the better.

36:32.603 --> 36:34.089
- Really?
- As you may know,

36:34.703 --> 36:36.992
Gene Robbins is dean
of journalism there.

36:37.326 --> 36:38.924
I had lunch with him
the other day...

36:39.154 --> 36:41.163
- Nevertheless, they haven't--
- And he was saying

36:41.414 --> 36:44.195
how the last few years
have really transformed

36:44.363 --> 36:47.663
the school's reputation
with black faculty and students.

36:48.058 --> 36:49.273
He's a white guy, right?

36:49.526 --> 36:51.620
- Who?
- Journalism fellow--

36:51.851 --> 36:53.885
Dean Wormer,
Dean Martin, whatever his name is.

36:54.089 --> 36:54.996
I worked with

36:55.373 --> 36:57.574
Gene Robbins
in Philadelphia.

36:57.841 --> 37:00.544
He is an excellent journalist
and a reliable source.

37:01.250 --> 37:03.056
I think race is beside the point,

37:04.291 --> 37:06.773
so why don't we hold on the deseg story

37:07.003 --> 37:09.670
until we can assign someone
to do some more reporting,

37:09.942 --> 37:13.289
get a real sense of how U.M.
Is perceived by minorities?

37:14.541 --> 37:16.197
All right, then.
Let's firm things up,

37:16.406 --> 37:19.149
take a look at where we stand
an hour from now.

37:21.884 --> 37:23.459
Why poke him with a stick?

37:23.676 --> 37:25.455
You know who Gene Robbins is.

37:25.696 --> 37:26.617
Who's poking?

37:26.828 --> 37:29.508
If I think something about a story,
I'm gonna speak on it.

37:29.830 --> 37:31.672
You know what
a healthy newsroom is?

37:32.008 --> 37:35.372
It's a magical place where people
argue about everything all the time.

37:35.622 --> 37:37.780
- I'm not poking anyone here.
- "Dean Martin"?

37:37.966 --> 37:39.350
Yeah, a little poke.

37:39.884 --> 37:40.885
Thank you.

38:48.258 --> 38:49.870
I know that wasn't no court date--

38:50.073 --> 38:52.416
He already got the gun charge
postponed twice--

38:52.635 --> 38:54.252
So what the fuck was that about?

38:54.505 --> 38:56.615
Remember that Russian
we locked up for murder,

38:57.161 --> 38:58.689
part of the port case a year back?

38:59.006 --> 39:02.371
I didn't work that case with you, man,
so, no, I don't remember.

39:02.630 --> 39:04.514
Well, Chris Partlow does.

39:29.074 --> 39:30.318
Miss Gutierrez.

39:35.133 --> 39:36.690
Get your ass over here.

39:39.370 --> 39:41.822
You say that 120 people
were evacuated.

39:42.162 --> 39:44.779
- Yeah. They were.
- You can't evacuate people.

39:45.007 --> 39:47.682
I mean, you can, if you want, but
that's not what you want to say here.

39:47.943 --> 39:49.653
A building can be evacuated.

39:50.235 --> 39:53.418
To evacuate a person
is to give that person an enema.

39:54.069 --> 39:55.738
The details, Miss Gutierrez.

39:56.381 --> 39:59.619
<i>At the Baltimore Sun, God
still resides in the details.</i>

40:00.943 --> 40:03.038
- You teach them, Spry.
- What are we gonna do

40:03.337 --> 40:04.971
with these children today?

40:10.004 --> 40:11.143
Fuckety-fuck.

40:12.456 --> 40:13.684
Another burnt doll.

40:14.653 --> 40:15.754
Carlyle again.

40:20.394 --> 40:21.604
<i>- Photo.
- Hey, Swag,</i>

40:21.771 --> 40:25.525
I'm looking at fire from east baltimore
and I got a burnt barbie in foreground.

40:26.741 --> 40:30.191
And I might actually believe you
if it wasn't Carlyle who took the shot.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.891
No fuckin' way I believe in
this picture. Print me something else.

40:33.136 --> 40:34.051
<i>All right.</i>

40:35.254 --> 40:38.247
Every fire photo he brings in
has got to be some burnt doll

40:38.498 --> 40:39.796
somewhere in the debris.

40:40.089 --> 40:41.801
I can see that cheating
motherfucker now

40:41.990 --> 40:44.414
with his fucking harem of dolls
pouring lighter fluid on each one.

40:45.294 --> 40:48.127
You check his fucking truck,
you'll find a whole collection of them.

40:48.638 --> 40:49.871
What's your lead?

40:50.063 --> 40:53.214
Council delays vote on the homeless
initiative at Carcetti's behest.

40:53.508 --> 40:56.381
He doesn't want it looks like the city's
running the homeless out of downtown,

40:56.622 --> 40:58.976
so he asked Naresse
to redraft the measure.

41:01.378 --> 41:02.377
He's right.

41:03.379 --> 41:04.748
You don't evacuate people.

41:06.217 --> 41:08.005
- What?
- Never mind.

41:10.440 --> 41:12.824
- Working on anything good?
- Just what day cops missed.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.669
A fatal in Charles County
and a gas leak downtown.

41:16.128 --> 41:17.183
Briefs, huh?

41:17.558 --> 41:18.943
A quiet day so far.

41:19.172 --> 41:20.554
It's a shit news town.

41:20.755 --> 41:21.755
You think?

41:21.939 --> 41:24.812
How many stories
go national out of here? Not many.

41:25.040 --> 41:27.874
Those bodies in the houses last year.
That got a lot of play.

41:28.262 --> 41:29.874
And they didn't even solve it, right?

41:30.378 --> 41:31.759
The story had no legs at all.

41:32.065 --> 41:34.202
Since then, what else?

41:34.688 --> 41:35.689
Jeff.

41:36.093 --> 41:37.119
Jeffy-Jeff.

41:38.001 --> 41:38.952
What?

41:40.340 --> 41:41.894
Come here.
Jesus Christ.

41:42.145 --> 41:43.109
What now?

41:43.269 --> 41:44.954
Did you stay for the zoning bills?

41:45.190 --> 41:46.670
No.
I came back here to write.

41:47.021 --> 41:48.369
Check the fucking library.

41:48.566 --> 41:50.576
Shit, check the clips, too.
It goes back a ways.

41:51.856 --> 41:54.480
No. Check that. You go back to the hall,
you get the vote on this thing.

41:54.819 --> 41:57.352
Find out who sponsored this.
Find out whether Carcetti or

41:57.650 --> 42:00.386
- Naresse or whoever's behind it.
- You buttonhole them, find out

42:00.681 --> 42:02.258
- what the hell's going on.
- Why?

42:02.467 --> 42:03.880
Who's Ricardo Hendrix?

42:04.062 --> 42:05.111
A drug dealer.

42:05.342 --> 42:07.143
Fatface Rick.
Alma, Scott.

42:08.039 --> 42:09.966
This property
on Baltimore Street is a titty bar

42:10.259 --> 42:12.311
the city wants
for the Howard Street enterprise zone,

42:12.499 --> 42:14.531
but this other property
they want to trade with him,

42:14.719 --> 42:16.443
I want to find out
what that's all about.

42:16.632 --> 42:18.830
This is a drug dealer
they're trading properties with?

42:19.038 --> 42:21.646
Yeah. He's got a record as long as
your arm. A couple convictions, too.

42:21.966 --> 42:23.473
Go, go.
Get some good quotes.

42:25.439 --> 42:26.989
I want you to go to this address.

42:27.752 --> 42:29.930
It's a strip club called Desperado.

42:30.500 --> 42:32.133
You ask around for the owner.

42:32.374 --> 42:33.870
His name's Ricardo Hendrix.

42:34.412 --> 42:36.022
You tell them
until we get a comment,

42:36.198 --> 42:38.480
we're gonna put ricky's picture
on the front page every day.

42:38.748 --> 42:39.748
Who is he?

42:40.085 --> 42:42.681
He's a drug dealer.
But from the look of this,

42:43.076 --> 42:45.356
he's run some sort of game
at city hall.

42:45.994 --> 42:48.810
We want a comment as to why he's
trading property with the city,

42:49.124 --> 42:50.866
what he stands
to make off the deal.

42:53.065 --> 42:54.716
What do you want from me?

42:55.685 --> 42:57.959
Pull clips,
check the morgue files,

42:58.685 --> 43:00.703
write the "A" matter
on Ricardo's history.

43:01.023 --> 43:04.039
Wait. She goes to strip clubs
and I'm pulling clips in the morgue?

43:04.645 --> 43:06.259
You guys late
for the council meeting?

43:06.429 --> 43:08.451
- Looking for you, sir.
- Me? I'm racing them out.

43:08.621 --> 43:10.521
I'm late for some charity thing
at the Walters.

43:10.709 --> 43:12.551
I was told I could
get a few minutes tonight.

43:12.764 --> 43:14.834
- You're on my schedule?
- Everything ran late today.

43:15.024 --> 43:16.774
They were supposed
to ring you, I think.

43:16.962 --> 43:18.547
Do it quick
or do we reschedule?

43:18.751 --> 43:21.810
Burrell's disbanded the unit
that's working the bodies in the houses.

43:22.044 --> 43:24.082
When we're fat with
money, you can come back on it.

43:24.252 --> 43:25.896
Investigations are not like that.

43:26.077 --> 43:28.644
You can't just drop one and then
pick it up down the road without--

43:28.962 --> 43:31.133
We got no money.
We've got no fucking money at all.

43:31.300 --> 43:33.227
There's nothing we can do
until the new fiscal.

43:33.394 --> 43:34.211
But, Tommy,

43:34.410 --> 43:35.957
that kills Clay Davis for me.

43:36.206 --> 43:37.859
We're about to go to grand jury on it.

43:38.024 --> 43:41.005
- Same unit is doing Clay?
- I need some profile for my shop.

43:42.791 --> 43:44.927
How much of that unit do you
need to bring the case in?

43:45.570 --> 43:46.938
A couple of detectives.

43:48.674 --> 43:50.642
I'll tell Rawls you can
keep 2 men for Clay.

43:50.809 --> 43:53.992
The rest of it is shut down
until we're able to dig out, OK?

43:55.157 --> 43:56.297
I got to run.

44:00.407 --> 44:04.852
So one thieving politician
trumps 22 dead bodies.

44:07.532 --> 44:08.671
Good to know.

44:12.125 --> 44:13.117
To save money,

44:13.278 --> 44:15.287
they're not even putting
ops cars in the street.

44:15.475 --> 44:16.628
No more 2-man patrols.

44:17.046 --> 44:19.465
- Jesus, where did the money go?
- Schools.

44:19.685 --> 44:22.565
Carcetti didn't want to lay off
teachers, so he fucks us instead.

44:22.796 --> 44:24.762
Seems like you got out
at the right time, huh?

44:25.529 --> 44:26.626
Look at you.

44:27.092 --> 44:29.135
Here's our boy Thomas
sporting the latest

44:29.401 --> 44:31.119
in downtown businesswear,

44:31.965 --> 44:34.872
an understated ensemble
that puts the "be" in subtle.

44:35.666 --> 44:36.979
There's a "b" in subtle?

44:38.528 --> 44:39.529
Seriously,

44:40.338 --> 44:41.444
you look well, Herc.

44:41.703 --> 44:44.350
I'm doing good, man.
I got more work than I can get to.

44:44.540 --> 44:46.102
It's like once word got around,

44:46.285 --> 44:48.442
these fucking lawyers came out
of the fucking woodwork.

44:48.968 --> 44:50.165
Which reminds me,

44:50.439 --> 44:52.234
I need one of you guys
to run a name for me.

44:53.347 --> 44:54.726
Tags, registration, and phone.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.115
While you're at it,
run a sheeting photo.

44:58.669 --> 45:00.323
Cause, hey, I'm buying
the next round, right?

45:01.059 --> 45:02.527
About fucking time!

45:06.116 --> 45:08.157
Not used to having money.
Kind of forget.

45:08.387 --> 45:09.454
Let's get a round.

45:13.831 --> 45:15.074
How's the brief?

45:15.578 --> 45:17.141
It's clean and it bites.

45:17.683 --> 45:20.409
- Deserves a front, off-lead, maybe.
- And we're saying what?

45:20.595 --> 45:21.937
That it's a sweetheart deal

45:22.146 --> 45:24.176
for a titty bar owner
with a big criminal history.

45:24.720 --> 45:27.957
He sells his existing location
to the city for 1.2 million

45:28.285 --> 45:30.190
and they sell him
a better piece of real estate

45:30.380 --> 45:32.306
to relocate his club
5 blocks west for 200,000.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.335
He clears a million
for laying in the cut.

45:36.545 --> 45:38.727
- What's the quid pro quo?
- We're going through donors

45:38.937 --> 45:40.829
in Naresse's campaign committee
as we speak.

45:41.210 --> 45:43.625
So far, we got 40,000
from Ricardo Hendrix

45:43.827 --> 45:46.468
and a bunch of people all using
the same address as the bar.

45:46.719 --> 45:49.114
- Why wasn't this on your budget?
- Well, we found it--

45:49.639 --> 45:52.814
Actually, Jeff Price found it
hidden in the zoning bills,

45:53.032 --> 45:54.834
bottom of the council agenda.

45:55.381 --> 45:57.266
He caught it late,
but he caught it.

45:57.980 --> 45:59.857
All right, front page,
below the fold.

46:01.954 --> 46:03.404
Metro desk, Phelps.

46:05.140 --> 46:06.610
Gus, Rrice

46:06.908 --> 46:09.228
for you, line 2,
and he's got Naresse with him.

46:09.594 --> 46:11.393
Aw, shit, here it comes.

46:13.578 --> 46:15.009
Gus? It's Jeff.

46:15.743 --> 46:17.835
The council president would like
a word with you.

46:18.190 --> 46:19.267
<i>On the record?</i>

46:19.463 --> 46:20.844
No. She's given me her quote.

46:21.077 --> 46:23.521
<i>- She wants to talk off the record.
- Put her on.</i>

46:28.220 --> 46:30.146
This is all perfectly above board.

46:30.476 --> 46:31.920
No doubt, madam president.

46:32.268 --> 46:34.005
We need this property
for redevelopment

46:34.176 --> 46:37.171
and it's in the city's interest
to allow Mr. Hendrix to relocate.

46:37.509 --> 46:39.710
And is it in the city's
interest to give him a property

46:39.879 --> 46:41.366
with twice as much floor space

46:41.528 --> 46:43.941
and give him a million dollars
for his trouble?

46:46.839 --> 46:48.986
Do you think he might have
made it clear to the council

46:49.153 --> 46:50.769
that Mr. Hendrix donated

46:51.024 --> 46:53.579
$60,000 to your campaign committee?

46:56.393 --> 46:57.837
I don't know, Ma'am.

46:58.017 --> 47:01.095
Where I live, 60,000
buys a lot of good will.

47:05.021 --> 47:06.451
Hey, Jeff, is that you?

47:06.768 --> 47:08.582
I'm putting you on hold for Spry.

47:08.818 --> 47:10.668
Yeah, give me
your on the record for Naresse.

47:10.944 --> 47:12.201
<i>- Ready?
- Yeah.</i>

47:12.373 --> 47:14.217
Shame we couldn't use
what she just gave us.

47:15.020 --> 47:16.243
What do you got?

47:17.081 --> 47:19.064
Keep running through
that campaign finance shit.

47:19.473 --> 47:22.698
There's at least $20,000
in contributions we haven't found yet.

47:24.268 --> 47:26.131
Naresse all but confirmed it.

48:06.232 --> 48:07.447
Yeah, it's me.

48:09.047 --> 48:10.680
We're going late tonight.

48:11.891 --> 48:12.891
I'm fine.

48:13.503 --> 48:14.739
No, I'm not.

48:15.830 --> 48:17.341
I'm just tired is all.

48:19.080 --> 48:20.591
I slur when I'm tired.

48:21.982 --> 48:23.135
That's all.

48:24.954 --> 48:25.953
Yeah.

48:27.890 --> 48:28.890
Night.

49:21.097 --> 49:21.914
Bubs.

49:22.472 --> 49:23.454
Hauk?

49:39.952 --> 49:42.138
That was a great pull at deadline.

49:42.326 --> 49:44.474
Hey, any night
a Baltimore politician

49:44.684 --> 49:47.385
calls you a son of a bitch
is a good night. Am I right?

49:48.101 --> 49:50.006
That was a good pull by Alma,

49:50.299 --> 49:53.210
getting that quote from Fatface Rick
for the home final.

49:53.440 --> 49:55.381
"I'm a businessman.
City wants to help me out,

49:55.578 --> 49:57.378
"I ain't gonna argue."
Sweet.

49:57.726 --> 49:59.794
- Thank you.
- How'd you get him to talk to you?

49:59.982 --> 50:02.138
I just walked in, sat down,

50:02.655 --> 50:05.940
watched the dancers for a few minutes,
and he came over to me.

50:06.501 --> 50:08.254
Thought I was looking for a job.

50:12.247 --> 50:15.031
You deserve more than
a contributing line for that.

50:15.999 --> 50:17.649
I don't know.
A contrib line is cool.

50:19.275 --> 50:21.265
You can't go far on contrib lines.

50:22.460 --> 50:23.773
Where do you want to go?

50:25.041 --> 50:26.868
<i>Times or Post.
Where else?</i>

50:27.730 --> 50:29.906
I don't know.
This is still a pretty good paper.

52:08.260 --> 52:10.451
I brought it
to the Mayor personally,

52:11.453 --> 52:14.913
but they're throwing their last dollars
into patrol and crime suppression.

52:15.204 --> 52:17.451
You think being on Marlo
and his people every damn day

52:17.741 --> 52:19.666
for a year isn't crime suppression?

52:20.080 --> 52:22.490
We lowered the body count
just by sitting on these people.

52:22.933 --> 52:25.447
- They knew they're hot, huh?
- After a year?

52:29.511 --> 52:31.419
Look. Promises
were made to me, as well.

52:32.570 --> 52:34.391
I was told a new day was coming.

52:35.917 --> 52:37.425
Clearly, this isn't it.

52:41.357 --> 52:42.877
Well, where
are we going, then?

52:44.020 --> 52:46.513
You and McNulty are back
to the Homicide rotation.

52:47.334 --> 52:49.214
Dozerman is temporarily
assigned to Tactical.

52:51.284 --> 52:54.005
Lieutenant. You're going
to fill a vacancy in the northern,

52:54.301 --> 52:55.685
4:00-12:00 shift.

52:55.920 --> 52:57.225
Freamon, Sydnor,

52:57.749 --> 52:59.822
you two are assigned
to the State's attorney's office

53:00.124 --> 53:02.230
to help grand-jury
the Clay Davis thing.

53:10.498 --> 53:12.198
When the money starts to flow,

53:13.277 --> 53:15.476
I'll get you all
back on this somehow.

53:18.687 --> 53:19.687
Sorry.

53:23.938 --> 53:27.505
Wonder what it feels like to work
in a real fucking police department.

53:38.131 --> 53:39.248
50 cent.

53:47.045 --> 53:48.134
50 cent.

53:52.371 --> 53:53.371
Obliged.

54:07.057 --> 54:08.749
When did this break last night?

54:09.076 --> 54:11.765
Gus saw it on the council
agenda around 9:30.

54:13.870 --> 54:15.696
It's a good fucking story.

54:34.766 --> 54:36.400
Who's doing the react piece?

54:36.649 --> 54:37.913
Jeff will. Why?

54:38.711 --> 54:39.745
I'm just--

54:40.587 --> 54:42.291
I need a story. I'm up.

54:43.370 --> 54:46.314
Yeah. Stay hungry like that.

54:47.679 --> 54:49.705
Good things come when they come.

55:03.681 --> 55:05.224
It's 2:00, people.

55:05.685 --> 55:07.136
I need budget lines.

55:07.531 --> 55:10.211
There are a million stories
in the naked city,

55:10.729 --> 55:13.912
but today you poor mooks
only need to throw me 3 or 4.

55:22.059 --> 55:23.399
Good afternoon...

55:33.270 --> 55:35.072
The Orioles will not
pay for pitching.

55:35.423 --> 55:37.580
-I should have never left the Bronx.
- You see this?

55:38.117 --> 55:39.772
- What?
- One of our clients

55:40.077 --> 55:41.502
on the front page.

55:42.677 --> 55:44.209
Represent Tiger Woods?

55:49.020 --> 55:51.010
All it cost me was a round of beers.

55:51.242 --> 55:52.975
They fucking love me
in the department.

55:53.177 --> 55:54.701
I'm a fucking martyr
is what I am.

55:55.429 --> 55:57.861
Pull over some black minister,
piss him off,

55:58.304 --> 56:00.024
and I lose my fucking job.

56:00.615 --> 56:01.755
One round?

56:02.690 --> 56:04.690
You, a prominent defense investigator,

56:04.918 --> 56:07.284
let these other guys
buy a round of drinks ever?

56:09.242 --> 56:10.156
OK.

56:11.236 --> 56:14.399
It's time you learned a little something
