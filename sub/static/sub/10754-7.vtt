WEBVTT

00:11.461 --> 00:13.504
(Martin) Quiet. It's starting.

00:13.671 --> 00:17.300
(TV Presenter) 'This is a political
announcement for Holden Thorpe.'

00:17.467 --> 00:20.303
You dragged us here to see Thorpe?

00:20.470 --> 00:24.056
He's a fascist, like Himmler
without the whimsy.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.853
(Man) 'Another American
for Holden Thorpe.'

00:29.020 --> 00:30.897
'I'm Marty Crane.'

00:31.147 --> 00:36.152
- Dear God!
- 'For 30 years I was a cop.

00:36.319 --> 00:40.448
'Then I was shot by an assassin
who wouldn't have been free

00:40.615 --> 00:43.826
'if it weren't for the bleeding hearts
in Congress.

00:44.076 --> 00:47.830
'I used to carry a gun.
Now I carry a cane.

00:49.999 --> 00:54.378
'I'm voting for Holden Thorpe.
He's running because I can't.'

00:57.214 --> 01:00.301
- Well?
- I don't know what to say.

01:00.468 --> 01:03.679
- I'm in a state of shock!
- Aren't we all?

01:03.846 --> 01:07.766
You were wonderful.
This calls for a celebration.

01:07.933 --> 01:10.561
- What'll you have?
- Give me a beer.

01:12.062 --> 01:15.190
Dad, how did this happen?

01:15.357 --> 01:18.944
I was in the park,
there was a rally for Thorpe.

01:19.111 --> 01:22.990
I talked to his people,
told them I was an ex-cop

01:23.157 --> 01:25.492
and they shoved a camera in my face.

01:25.659 --> 01:30.039
- They're exploiting you.
- No, they're not. I like Thorpe.

01:30.205 --> 01:33.584
How could you support
that odious hose-head?

01:33.751 --> 01:38.213
He once said, "Cancer aside,
tobacco is good for the economy."

01:38.380 --> 01:41.049
He's for more cops on the street.

01:41.216 --> 01:43.719
It can't hurt, now everyone's armed.

01:43.886 --> 01:46.180
We don't have many guns in England.

01:46.346 --> 01:49.641
You don't need guns.
You've got kidney pie.

01:52.686 --> 01:54.646
Hello.

01:54.813 --> 01:56.815
- It's Duke.
- Oh!

01:56.982 --> 02:00.652
- Sherry?
- I couldn't, Niles. I'm too upset.

02:00.819 --> 02:02.946
I'm glad you liked it.

02:03.113 --> 02:06.950
I've got a lot of showbiz
secrets to tell you.

02:07.117 --> 02:11.997
They can make you cry on cue
by pulling a hair out of your nose.

02:12.164 --> 02:17.252
What? Really? Guys, quick!
Channel 14! My other spot!

02:17.419 --> 02:22.757
This one was my idea. Remember
Lyndon Johnson showing his scar?

02:22.924 --> 02:24.968
'Hi, I'm Marty Crane.

02:25.135 --> 02:29.598
'Crime isn't pretty.
lf you don't believe me, look at this.'

02:35.854 --> 02:38.481
- Can I help you?
- What's on today?

02:38.648 --> 02:41.109
- Kenyan blend.
- No, no, no.

02:41.276 --> 02:44.446
They still poach elephants.
What else?

02:44.612 --> 02:48.950
- Dark roast Brazilian.
- Not till they stop rain forest loss.

02:49.701 --> 02:53.580
- Salvadoran?
- Not with their human rights record.

02:53.746 --> 02:56.749
We're down to
the Hawaiian Cona blend.

02:56.916 --> 03:00.461
Or have they slaughtered
too many macadamia nuts?

03:03.006 --> 03:05.800
That'll be fine, thank you.

03:07.343 --> 03:09.804
- Niles.
- I can't stand it.

03:09.971 --> 03:15.143
I just walked by a store with 22 TV
sets in the window showing Dad's...

03:16.644 --> 03:19.188
...butt.

03:19.981 --> 03:22.984
I saw it. I don't know what's worse -

03:23.151 --> 03:26.237
seeing his butt, or what it stands for.

03:27.029 --> 03:30.950
I just can't believe
our father is actually endorsing

03:31.117 --> 03:33.411
that self-serving fear-monger.

03:33.578 --> 03:38.332
I've given this a lot of thought
and I realise Dad isn't the problem.

03:38.499 --> 03:42.587
He's supporting his candidate.
The problem lies with us.

03:42.753 --> 03:45.590
- Us? We've done nothing.
- Exactly.

03:45.756 --> 03:49.927
"For evil to triumph requires
only that good men do nothing."

03:50.094 --> 03:53.389
- Edmund Burke.
- I have that quotation framed.

03:53.556 --> 03:57.476
I mean to put it in my office
but keep forgetting.

03:58.644 --> 04:02.732
Anyway, the time has come
for you and me to get involved.

04:02.898 --> 04:04.734
How?

04:04.900 --> 04:08.028
Support Thorpe's opponent,
Phil Patterson.

04:08.195 --> 04:12.950
- I'm voting for Patterson.
- I had something more in mind.

04:13.117 --> 04:16.786
I spoke to some people
at Patterson's headquarters.

04:16.954 --> 04:19.832
They'd like you
to do a TV endorsement.

04:19.999 --> 04:22.041
Niles, I'd love to help,

04:22.209 --> 04:26.255
but you must realize that,
as a radio psychiatrist,

04:26.422 --> 04:30.217
I can't take the chance
of alienating my listeners.

04:30.384 --> 04:34.430
People needing help might be put off
if they knew my politics.

04:34.596 --> 04:39.184
Think about it. A candidate
like this doesn't come often.

04:39.351 --> 04:42.771
He's hard working,
he volunteers at a soup kitchen.

04:42.938 --> 04:47.276
He cares about people.
He believes in what we believe in.

04:47.443 --> 04:51.613
- Buy chocolates, send a kid to camp.
- Can't you see we're talking?

04:58.829 --> 05:03.625
Thank you for your call, Susan.
We'll be back after this message.

05:05.585 --> 05:10.048
(Holden Thorpe) 'Crime: it's epidemic.
It strikes fast and it can strike you.

05:10.215 --> 05:13.760
'I'm Holden Thorpe.
Send me to Washington because...'

05:13.927 --> 05:17.013
...it's better than having you here.

05:19.433 --> 05:22.894
He makes it sound like
it's either vote for him

05:23.061 --> 05:25.105
or be found murdered in bed.

05:25.272 --> 05:30.652
I wouldn't worry, Roz. What are the
chances of finding you there alone?

05:32.362 --> 05:34.948
- Sports fan, how they hanging?
- OK.

05:35.115 --> 05:37.158
I was talking to Roz.

05:45.375 --> 05:47.419
Ten seconds.

05:47.627 --> 05:51.673
(Thorpe) 'Vote for me. My programme
gives the streets back to the people.'

05:51.840 --> 05:57.429
That's good. With your tax programme
that's where they'll be sleeping.

05:57.595 --> 06:01.891
We'll be back for one more call
after this newsbreak.

06:02.058 --> 06:05.145
Then, next up, Bob Bulldog Brisco...

06:08.273 --> 06:10.692
and the Gonzo Sports Show.

06:11.609 --> 06:16.197
- I've asked you not to do that.
- Way to be impartial, Doc.

06:16.364 --> 06:20.702
Thorpe's a good man. You voting
for that pretty boy Patterson?

06:20.868 --> 06:23.913
He's great.
His reapportionment plan makes sense.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.749
Forget it. He's happily married.

06:28.668 --> 06:31.421
So is Thorpe. His wife's a cow,
he still loves her.

06:31.587 --> 06:35.425
- There's a bumper sticker.
- Back in a minute.

06:36.759 --> 06:40.638
I liked your shot at Thorpe.
Our next caller disagrees.

06:41.472 --> 06:45.268
Really? Put him on.
I welcome contrasting viewpoints.

06:46.143 --> 06:48.771
Hello, Seattle.
Roz, who is on the line?

06:48.938 --> 06:51.816
On line one, we have Holden Thorpe.

06:54.277 --> 06:57.446
- Go ahead, caller.
- (Thorpe) 'Crane? Thorpe.

06:57.613 --> 07:01.283
- 'Let me ask you, are you married?'
- Divorced.

07:01.450 --> 07:07.248
- 'Did you ever serve in the military?'
- I have congenitally weak ankles.

07:07.415 --> 07:12.211
'I see. So a guy like you -
unmarried, didn't serve his country -

07:12.378 --> 07:17.967
'criticizes a patriotic family man
who fought in the battle of Grenada.

07:18.134 --> 07:22.513
- 'I went in on the first wave.'
- On a surfboard, I suppose.

07:24.765 --> 07:27.560
'When the likes of you are off the radio,

07:27.726 --> 07:31.480
'America will be a nice,
friendly place to live again.'

07:31.647 --> 07:35.025
You've said your piece;
now listen to mine.

07:35.526 --> 07:40.698
Hang up, will you? You may not listen,
but Seattle will hear me out.

07:40.864 --> 07:44.159
They won't.
The show ended five seconds ago.

07:54.002 --> 07:56.046
Oh, hello, there.

07:56.213 --> 07:59.716
I'm Dr Frasier Crane.
You may know me from my radio show.

07:59.883 --> 08:03.595
Today,
I'm speaking as a concerned citizen.

08:03.762 --> 08:09.309
As a mental health expert,
I've been listening to Phil Patterson.

08:09.476 --> 08:12.229
I like the way his mind works.

08:12.396 --> 08:15.857
He's a visionary
who cares about the little people.

08:16.024 --> 08:21.571
That's why I'm proud to say
I'm behind Phil Patterson for Congress.

08:22.739 --> 08:26.743
Thanks, Frasier.
Together, we can live the dream.

08:30.747 --> 08:33.875
Phil Patterson: the sane choice.

08:34.501 --> 08:39.089
OK, give us five minutes
to adjust the lights and we'll shoot.

08:39.256 --> 08:41.924
Yes, adjust those lights.

08:42.092 --> 08:45.053
They need to be...
lighter and...brighter.

08:51.685 --> 08:53.978
- Thanks, Frasier.
- Our pleasure.

08:54.145 --> 08:57.982
The Cranes have a history
of political involvement.

08:58.149 --> 09:02.862
My wife has all our servants
at your campaign HQ licking envelopes.

09:04.114 --> 09:09.035
She'd do it herself, but the poor thing
can't produce saliva.

09:18.711 --> 09:22.632
- Hello.
- You agreed to keep him out.

09:22.799 --> 09:28.429
You know how he gets. He whines
and whimpers until you can't stand it.

09:28.596 --> 09:31.474
Don't let them talk about you like that.

09:31.641 --> 09:34.060
She was talking about me.

09:34.686 --> 09:37.313
- Hi. Marty Crane.
- Phil Patterson.

09:37.480 --> 09:40.441
You look familiar
but I can't place you.

09:40.608 --> 09:43.277
- Let me give you a hint.
- Dad!

09:44.487 --> 09:47.114
I'm just trying to help the guy!

09:47.281 --> 09:49.867
He did a commercial
for your opponent.

09:50.034 --> 09:52.286
Yes. It came back to me.

09:53.579 --> 09:55.623
Hello. Daphne Moon.

09:55.790 --> 09:59.168
My uncle was a political writer
for a London tabloid.

09:59.335 --> 10:03.589
I remember his biggest scoop.
The headline read:

10:03.756 --> 10:08.511
"High-ranking politician
caught in women's clothing."

10:08.678 --> 10:11.555
On page two you found out
it was Margaret Thatcher,

10:11.722 --> 10:14.350
but by then you'd bought the paper.

10:20.523 --> 10:24.026
- Thank you, Miss Moon.
- It's a little hot.

10:24.193 --> 10:27.446
- Want to step out on the balcony?
- Great.

10:29.406 --> 10:32.284
- Oh, beautiful view.
- Thank you.

10:33.160 --> 10:36.121
Yes, I feel very lucky living here.

10:36.288 --> 10:40.417
And I feel lucky to be
a part of your campaign, as well.

10:40.584 --> 10:44.880
It's me who's lucky. It's a boost
to get an endorsement from you.

10:45.047 --> 10:49.009
- My name doesn't carry much weight.
- People love you.

10:49.176 --> 10:51.804
I've listened to your show.

10:51.970 --> 10:55.516
To tell the truth,
I've even thought of calling in.

10:55.682 --> 10:58.268
Really? What for?

10:59.645 --> 11:02.397
Oh, it's kind of sensitive.

11:02.564 --> 11:05.275
Listen, Phil, as a psychiatrist,

11:05.442 --> 11:08.654
anything you tell me
will be in confidence.

11:11.073 --> 11:15.118
It's funny how, the more
you bottle things up inside,

11:15.285 --> 11:17.663
the bigger they seem to be.

11:19.164 --> 11:22.584
Well, I've never
told anybody this before but...

11:23.460 --> 11:25.504
OK, here goes.

11:26.755 --> 11:28.882
Six years ago,

11:29.049 --> 11:31.510
I was abducted by aliens.

11:48.777 --> 11:50.612
Aliens?

11:52.280 --> 11:55.784
They took me to their spaceship
for a conference.

11:55.950 --> 11:58.912
They're concerned about our planet.

11:59.996 --> 12:03.291
Hey, you were right.
Now I've said it out loud,

12:03.458 --> 12:06.544
it's doesn't seem like that big a deal.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.714
No.

12:11.633 --> 12:15.804
They're ready, gentlemen.
Let's elect a Congressman!

12:15.970 --> 12:17.805
Frasier?

12:23.728 --> 12:25.563
Frasier?

12:28.316 --> 12:31.819
(Man) Roll it. And... Action.

12:36.783 --> 12:40.745
Hello. I'm Dr Frasier Crane.

12:41.454 --> 12:43.956
You may know me from my radio show,

12:44.123 --> 12:47.460
but today,
I'm speaking as a concerned citizen.

12:47.627 --> 12:50.004
A deeply concerned citizen.

12:53.007 --> 12:56.677
As a mental health expert,
I've been listening

12:56.844 --> 13:00.973
to what my good friend,
Phil Patterson, has to say.

13:01.974 --> 13:04.727
I like the way his mind works.

13:06.270 --> 13:09.982
He's a visionary who cares about...

13:13.152 --> 13:15.363
...the "little people".

13:20.534 --> 13:22.870
That's why I'm proud to say

13:23.037 --> 13:26.707
that I'm behind Phil Patterson
for Congress.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.960
Thanks, Frasier.

13:33.214 --> 13:36.300
Together, we can live the dream.

13:38.344 --> 13:40.554
Phil Patterson...

13:40.721 --> 13:43.265
the sane choice.

13:43.515 --> 13:46.977
- OK, cut!
- God, I'm burning up!

13:50.397 --> 13:54.777
You were nervous.
Take a few minutes and we'll try again.

13:55.027 --> 13:58.155
I got mine on the first take!

13:58.322 --> 14:01.366
Frasier, may I see you in the kitchen?

14:03.202 --> 14:05.245
What's going on?

14:05.412 --> 14:08.081
I've something to get off of my chest

14:08.248 --> 14:11.877
but I'd be violating
doctor-patient confidence.

14:12.127 --> 14:16.298
Nothing is more sacrosanct
than professional ethics.

14:16.548 --> 14:20.177
Fortunately,
I know a trick to get around them.

14:24.056 --> 14:28.935
I'll be your psychiatrist. Then you
can spill your guts with impunity.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.438
It's borderline, but I'm desperate.

14:33.065 --> 14:36.943
Just now, on the balcony,

14:37.110 --> 14:41.573
Phil Patterson told me he had been...
abducted by aliens.

14:44.117 --> 14:48.663
Apparently, he was beamed up
to the mother ship

14:48.830 --> 14:52.042
for a little interplanetary chitchat.

14:58.340 --> 15:00.425
This is bad, isn't it?

15:02.177 --> 15:05.972
Niles, it's awful.
We'll look like such idiots!

15:06.222 --> 15:09.601
We?
It was your idea to get into politics.

15:09.768 --> 15:13.438
My idea? I can't believe
you have the gall to tell me...

15:13.605 --> 15:15.648
I wanted to stop you.

15:15.815 --> 15:19.736
This isn't getting us anywhere.
Put that away!

15:21.237 --> 15:24.365
All right. What are we going to do?

15:24.532 --> 15:27.869
Convince Phil to drop out
and seek help.

15:28.036 --> 15:30.705
- lf he drops out, Thorpe wins.
- Forget it!

15:30.955 --> 15:36.377
- Then forget education and the arts.
- I should still back Phil?

15:36.544 --> 15:40.590
Can you tell me with certainty,
in such a vast universe,

15:40.757 --> 15:43.760
there isn't intelligent life elsewhere?

15:44.927 --> 15:48.264
At present, I'm not sure there
is intelligent life in this kitchen!

15:52.435 --> 15:56.939
Assume it's in his imagination.
How often does he see them?

15:57.190 --> 16:01.235
Only once. Which suggests
it was brought on by overwork,

16:01.402 --> 16:03.863
rather than a paranoid delusion.

16:04.030 --> 16:08.576
- My diagnosis exactly.
- Phil deserves his chance.

16:08.743 --> 16:12.997
- He still needs professional help.
- Yes! The best there is.

16:13.164 --> 16:18.502
- But we won't turn our backs on him.
- No. So will you treat him?

16:18.669 --> 16:21.297
I'm a doctor, not a miracle worker!

16:24.800 --> 16:31.182
It's time I got my eyebrows waxed.
I'm getting that Romanian peasant look.

16:32.391 --> 16:36.687
- It doesn't help that I haven't slept.
- Dating a snorer?

16:38.480 --> 16:43.485
I'm getting tired of your constant
insinuation that I sleep around.

16:43.652 --> 16:48.407
I didn't sleep 'cause of Chopper Dave.
When he's bored with traffic reports,

16:48.574 --> 16:51.827
he likes to buzz people's apartments
in his helicopter.

16:51.994 --> 16:54.788
- Annoying.
- It didn't bother me.

16:54.955 --> 16:59.710
But the guy I was with
is a Vietnam vet and he had flashbacks.

17:01.211 --> 17:04.089
Greetings, losers! Heard the news?

17:04.256 --> 17:08.594
One of your overpaid idols
passed his urine test?

17:08.761 --> 17:12.890
Laugh, but word's out
about Patterson and his aliens.

17:13.056 --> 17:16.059
- My God!
- It's all over TV.

17:16.226 --> 17:20.314
- How did they find out?
- You can't keep this quiet.

17:20.480 --> 17:24.026
Every station is serving
his heart on a platter.

17:24.192 --> 17:28.113
It's just like the media
to find a flaw to ruin a career.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.490
I have a conduit to the public ear.

17:30.657 --> 17:34.995
- I won't let Phil go without a fight!
- What aliens?

17:35.162 --> 17:40.751
Patterson's got two illegal aliens
from Guatemala working in his house.

17:42.335 --> 17:45.213
No green cards, no documents,
no chance!

17:47.799 --> 17:50.552
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.

17:50.719 --> 17:54.890
I have just learned that
it has become public knowledge

17:55.056 --> 17:59.728
that Phil Patterson believes
in aliens from outer space.

18:01.938 --> 18:04.691
Not only that,
he believes he has met them,

18:04.858 --> 18:08.486
that he was beamed aboard
their spaceship for a chat.

18:08.653 --> 18:14.534
Shocked? Well, all right.
But let's ask ourselves these questions.

18:14.701 --> 18:16.828
Does this harmless delusion,

18:16.995 --> 18:21.207
most likely brought on
by overwork and sleep deprivation,

18:21.374 --> 18:25.253
adversely affect his voting record?
I say no!

18:25.920 --> 18:27.964
What leader doesn't have quirks?

18:28.131 --> 18:31.801
Reagan saw astrologers.
Patton believed in reincarnation.

18:31.968 --> 18:35.305
Even Hoover let his slip show
once in a while.

18:36.306 --> 18:38.433
People, this is a great leader.

18:38.600 --> 18:42.020
We shouldn't consider
minor eccentricities.

18:42.186 --> 18:46.357
What's important, what really counts,
is what's in here.

18:46.524 --> 18:49.152
I'm pointing at my chest now.

18:56.868 --> 19:01.789
(TV Presenter) 'The results are in.
Holden Thorpe is elected

19:01.956 --> 19:04.667
'with a whopping 92% of the vote.'

19:06.919 --> 19:09.672
At least Mr Patterson got 8%.

19:09.839 --> 19:13.885
They must have counted
absentee votes from planet Krypton.

19:15.511 --> 19:18.723
Now, Dr Crane. It wasn't all your fault.

19:18.889 --> 19:22.768
Those Guatemalans
would have cost him votes anyway.

19:22.935 --> 19:26.480
Those Guatemalans
were exchange students.

19:26.647 --> 19:31.318
Phil gave them room and board
to show goodwill between countries.

19:31.485 --> 19:34.905
I'd like to stay and gloat,
but I've got to change

19:35.072 --> 19:39.869
to go to the celebration at Thorpe HQ.
You're welcome to tag along.

19:40.035 --> 19:43.038
You're quite a hero down there!

19:44.790 --> 19:46.917
No, thank you!

19:47.084 --> 19:49.920
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

19:50.087 --> 19:53.007
When will I learn
it hurts when I do that?

19:53.173 --> 19:55.217
(Doorbell)

20:03.183 --> 20:07.396
- Oh. Phil. Come on in.
- Hi, Frasier. Thank you.

20:07.563 --> 20:12.109
Just came by to return
this good-luck tie you loaned me.

20:14.278 --> 20:18.323
I saw you wearing it
for your concession speech.

20:18.490 --> 20:22.411
A little embarrassing,
having to do it before lunch.

20:22.578 --> 20:26.039
But it gave me time
to pick up my dry cleaning.

20:26.999 --> 20:29.543
- I am so sorry.
- It's OK.

20:29.710 --> 20:35.132
- You thought you were defending me.
- Seattle deserves better than Thorpe.

20:36.133 --> 20:38.677
That's politics. It's just one election.

20:38.844 --> 20:41.972
- I'll be back.
- You really think you can?

20:42.139 --> 20:46.309
Maybe I'm a dreamer,
but I believe anything's possible.

20:48.270 --> 20:50.021
Phil.

20:50.188 --> 20:52.482
I've got to ask you...

20:55.735 --> 20:58.363
Do you really believe it happened?

20:58.530 --> 21:02.868
I honestly wish
I could say it didn't, but it did.

21:03.034 --> 21:07.872
I guess you'll never believe it
unless it happens to you.

21:08.039 --> 21:10.500
So, what's next for you?

21:11.793 --> 21:14.296
Maybe I'll run in California.

21:16.464 --> 21:20.009
A thing like this
could actually help me there.

21:48.037 --> 21:50.206
Anything's possible.

22:02.593 --> 22:05.054
Oh, very funny, Chopper Dave!

22:14.355 --> 22:20.027
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:20.194 --> 22:21.571
# Quite stylish!

22:21.737 --> 22:26.575
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:28.661 --> 22:34.500
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:34.667 --> 22:37.294
# They're calling again #

22:37.461 --> 22:40.131
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
