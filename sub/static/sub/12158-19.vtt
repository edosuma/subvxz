00:05.439 --> 00:06.772
Okay, people.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.440
I've decided where
I want to go to college.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.709
What's your rush, huh?
You're just a sophomore.

00:10.711 --> 00:13.645
Unless you've decided on
the ohio state university,

00:13.647 --> 00:16.015
In which case,
what took you so long?

00:16.017 --> 00:18.717
I'm not leaning toward
<i>the</i> ohio state university,

00:18.719 --> 00:21.020
Mostly because its alumni
insist on calling it

00:21.022 --> 00:23.122
"the" ohio state university.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.857
Mike:
Well, it sounds better

00:24.859 --> 00:27.192
Than <i>the</i> safety school
of the midwest.

00:28.828 --> 00:31.296
Well, I suppose you want her
to go to your precious michigan.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.032
I love Eve, but I'd rather
someone go there

00:33.034 --> 00:34.666
That can help them
with the football team.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.902
Michigan still has
a football team?

00:36.904 --> 00:38.804
This is gonna be a much better
year this year.
Guys! Guys!

00:38.806 --> 00:41.206
We'll go to a --
as much as I would love
to be part of a rivalry

00:41.208 --> 00:42.875
In an irrelevant
football conference,

00:42.877 --> 00:45.010
I'm not going
to either of those.

00:45.012 --> 00:48.180
And the best part is the school
won't cost you anything, dad.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.215
Nothing? I'm in.
Nope.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.151
Honey, we're gonna get
a new boat!

00:52.153 --> 00:54.686
You know what? We could even
call it <i>"the scholarship."</i>

00:54.688 --> 00:56.055
[ laughs ]

00:56.057 --> 00:57.923
Well, surprise.
What school?

00:57.925 --> 00:59.091
West point.

00:59.093 --> 01:01.660
Military school?

01:01.662 --> 01:03.729
What parent wouldn't
be happy that their
kid picked west point?

01:03.731 --> 01:05.164
Well, right off the top
of my head,

01:05.166 --> 01:06.999
Mr. And mrs. Gandhi.

01:07.001 --> 01:08.367
I never got gandhi
anyway.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.269
He wore a diaper,
didn't like food.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.372
Why would you need
the diaper?

01:13.374 --> 01:15.240
Well, it's pretty tough
to get in,

01:15.242 --> 01:16.742
So I'll have to maintain
my straight a's.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.043
Right, right, right.
Yeah, but, honey, wait.

01:18.045 --> 01:19.711
With those grades,
you could go anywhere,

01:19.713 --> 01:22.915
Even
the ohio state university.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.850
Yeah, yeah, mom.
I got it.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.018
It's the harvard
of central ohio.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.086
Look...

01:29.722 --> 01:32.257
I want to be an Army ranger,
not a buckeye.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.293
There you go.
You got to go with her on this.

Your mascot is basically
an acorn wearing a cardigan.

-- Captions by vitac --

Hey, mr. B.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.943
I'm almost done
with the rock-climbing display,

01:50.945 --> 01:52.811
But I'm having a little trouble
with the sign.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.046
Well, work at it.

01:54.048 --> 01:56.315
Reading can be very difficult,
Kyle.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.883
Excuse me.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.818
Oh. You look like
you're in charge.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.086
You see that?

02:01.088 --> 02:03.322
You've got the chiseled features
of a leader.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.991
Also, his face
is on that poster.

02:05.993 --> 02:09.328
Uh, I know that poster has
a big smile that says "welcome,"

02:09.330 --> 02:11.930
But it should be saying,
"this is for employees only."

02:11.932 --> 02:13.765
Oh, well, that --
that's what we're doing here.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.734
Jason would like to be
an employee.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.003
Shake the man's hand,
Jason.

02:18.005 --> 02:21.940
Did you wash
after using the lavatory?

02:21.942 --> 02:24.476
I'm gonna need an answer
to that, son.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.980
The man you want to talk to
is right behind you --

02:27.982 --> 02:30.249
The owner of the store,
Ed Alzate.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.950
Ed, you might want to
think twice

02:31.952 --> 02:33.819
About shaking
this young man's hand.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.154
Wendi grayson.
Hi.

02:35.156 --> 02:36.688
And my son, Jason.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.759
Jason grayson.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.162
Now, who would do that
to a kid?

02:43.164 --> 02:44.463
[ chuckles ]

02:44.465 --> 02:46.331
Jason, tell him
why we're here.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.168
Jason filled out an application
for a job here in your store,

02:49.170 --> 02:51.837
And he hasn't heard
anything back in three days.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.772
He's very upset.

02:56.142 --> 02:59.011
I-I-I can see that.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.979
Are we in any danger?

03:00.981 --> 03:02.614
Jason's off for the summer,

03:02.616 --> 03:05.017
And he needs something to do
with all of that energy.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.118
Mm-hmm.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.953
I do stuff.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.988
You won't be sorry,
mr. Alzate.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.723
He's intelligent.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.293
He can type on that thing
without even looking.
Ah.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.328
Watch. Jason.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.397
See? Look at that.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.899
Tell him about
your positive attributes.

03:20.901 --> 03:24.970
I'm hard-working.
I'm conscientious.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.371
And?

03:27.373 --> 03:29.241
You're a self-starter.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.210
Oh.

03:31.212 --> 03:34.479
Well, we're always looking
for a kid like that.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.548
Come back
when you're him.

03:38.518 --> 03:41.253
His father is dead.

03:44.490 --> 03:48.160
Mrs. Grayson,
this is very unusual.

03:48.162 --> 03:49.728
I've never had someone

03:49.730 --> 03:52.064
Bring his mother
to a job interview before.

03:52.066 --> 03:55.500
Well, that's my Jason.
He is one in a million.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.603
He'll be very reliable,

03:57.605 --> 04:00.739
And he'll be on time every day
because I will be driving him.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.508
What time shall I have him here
in the morning?

04:03.510 --> 04:05.677
You mean tomorrow morning?
That works for us.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.246
Say,
"thank you," Jason.

04:07.248 --> 04:08.413
You're welcome.

04:11.351 --> 04:12.951

on the left.

Uh, my left

04:20.094 --> 04:23.428
We're facing
the same direction.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.497
I'll turn around.

04:27.367 --> 04:30.235
Mike, thanks for dumping
that woman off on me.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.271
Sorry about that,
but I had to get out of there.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.239
I ended up
hiring her son.

04:34.241 --> 04:36.775
Well, put him in the stockroom.
We need another doorstop.

04:36.777 --> 04:40.145
Why did you hire
that kid?

04:40.147 --> 04:41.580
Well,
we need some extra help,

04:41.582 --> 04:43.148
And he can't be worse

04:43.150 --> 04:44.816
Than the other college kids
who apply.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.618
"can't be worse
than the other kids" --

04:46.620 --> 04:48.620

All right.
That's perfect, Kyle.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.157
Now put the fake rocks
back up at the top,

04:52.159 --> 04:53.258
And then we're all set.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.259
Yes, sir.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.894
You know,
I blame the parents.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.663
You know,
they pamper their kids.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.132
That's why they end up living
at home until they're 30.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.434
They're called millennials.
You know why?

05:02.436 --> 05:03.835
'cause it takes 1,000 years to
get them out of the damn house.

05:05.605 --> 05:07.239
Eve's not taking
the easy way out.

05:07.241 --> 05:10.242
Hmm.
Guess where
she wants to go to college.

Oh, come on.
Yeah.

You see that?
You raised a good one, mikey.
Yeah.

Yes, yes.
I guess there are

bite down on it...

...I'll be back
in 127 hours.

somewhere else?

with all that folding.

05:48.114 --> 05:49.448
I don't know.

too much shout and cheer.

an "a" in geometry

anybody but hardin.

with this guy, dad.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.224
You do all the right things
to solve a math problem,

09:19.226 --> 09:20.725
But if you make
one tiny mistake at the end,

09:20.727 --> 09:21.660
He marks
the whole thing wrong.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.195
What?!

09:24.197 --> 09:27.098
If you get a wrong answer,
he marks it wrong?!

09:27.100 --> 09:28.867
Dad...

09:28.869 --> 09:32.037
Where's this guy from,
north korea?

09:32.039 --> 09:33.738
Dad, I'm still gonna be
learning geometry.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.073
I'll just be getting
an "a"

09:35.075 --> 09:37.008
Like I do in all
my other honors classes.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.877
You're running
from a challenge.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.111
That doesn't sound like
someone going to west point,

09:40.113 --> 09:41.313
Unless the west point's
somewhere in France.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.250
You know, I think Eve's
being smart about this.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.885
By going
to a dumber class?
No. Wait, no, no, no.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.220
Gpa is very important.
I know that.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.856
Getting into college --
it's insanely competitive.

09:51.858 --> 09:54.025
I-I doubt that I would get
accepted at ohio state now.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.860
Sure you would have.

09:55.862 --> 09:56.895
They take anybody.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.307
Mr. Alzate,
just a heads up.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.775
Mrs. Grayson
is here to see you.

10:10.777 --> 10:11.977
Who?

10:11.979 --> 10:14.279
Like, this tall,
real pushy,

10:14.281 --> 10:16.715
Has a long list of ways I'm not
as good as her son, Jason.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.817
Oh, god.
Tell her I'm not here.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.152
Mr. Alzate is not here.

10:23.756 --> 10:26.558
Thanks for the help,
Kyle.

10:26.560 --> 10:29.828
I just came by to say thank you
for giving my Jason the job.

10:29.830 --> 10:30.929
You're welcome.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.163
Yeah,
he came home yesterday

10:32.165 --> 10:33.331
And told me all about
his first day.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.799
Apparently, it was --

10:34.801 --> 10:37.469
How did he put it?
"fine."

10:37.471 --> 10:39.137
You know,
I don't get it.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.506
I have layers and layers
of employees

10:41.508 --> 10:43.642
Just to keep this
from happening.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.578
Oh.
I-I don't mean to intrude.

10:46.580 --> 10:49.280
I just -- I came
to bring Jason his lunch.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.416
Which one of these offices
is his?

10:51.418 --> 10:54.252
Jason doesn't have
an office.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.821
H-he's working
in the stockroom.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.190
[ chuckles ] how will you
recognize his potential

10:59.192 --> 11:00.925
If he's hidden away
in a stockroom?

11:00.927 --> 11:03.128
Give him that boy's job.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.096
Uh, mrs. Grayson --

11:05.098 --> 11:07.365
Wendi.
Yes. [ chuckles ]

11:07.367 --> 11:10.502
Y-your son is a part-time
seasonal employee.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.804
I shouldn't even know
his name.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.707
I sure as hell
shouldn't know his mother's.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.308
I'm sorry, mr. Alzate.

11:17.310 --> 11:20.612
I just -- Jason is all I have
in the world right now,

11:20.614 --> 11:22.814
And the house
seems so empty and quiet,

11:22.816 --> 11:24.349
And when he's gone,

11:24.351 --> 11:28.620
I-I find myself talking to
the dent he left in the couch.

11:28.622 --> 11:31.723
Mrs. Grayson,
flip the cushion and move on.

11:33.826 --> 11:36.628
This is not good for Jason
or for you, either.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.997
Just find something else
to focus on.

11:38.999 --> 11:42.000
Yeah.
Maybe you're right.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.602
How are you feeling,
mr. Alzate?

11:47.239 --> 11:49.708
I have...
A slight headache,

11:49.710 --> 11:53.311
But I'm pretty sure
it will be gone soon.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.980
I-I noticed a little bit
of cloudiness on your tongue

11:55.982 --> 11:57.649
When you were shouting
at me.

11:57.651 --> 12:00.151
[ chuckling ]
I wasn't shouting.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.987
How cloudy?
Open.

12:02.989 --> 12:04.823
Oh, that's bad.
You've got to sit down.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.658
I'm gonna -- I'm gonna
have you try something.

12:06.660 --> 12:09.160
I made it for Jason,
but you need it much, much more.
I'm fine.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.995
I'm fine.

12:10.997 --> 12:13.098
I-I won't take "no"
for an answer.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.399
I just gave your kid
a job.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.167
You won't take "yes"
for an answer.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.069
Oh, come on, please.
This is --

12:18.071 --> 12:21.372
You know,
this is very tasty.
Yeah.

12:21.374 --> 12:24.175
I call it
my niacin pasta...
Mmm. Yeah.

12:24.177 --> 12:28.346
...Because instead of flour,
I use niacin.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.948
Well, this is --
this is quite delicious.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.082
Mmm.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.851
Trust me.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.854
You're gonna get a "thank you"
note from your colon.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.590
I doubt that.
No one writes notes anymore.

12:38.592 --> 12:39.924
[ both laugh ]

12:43.529 --> 12:45.463
Uh, excuse me.

12:45.465 --> 12:46.598
Mr. Hardin?

12:46.600 --> 12:48.066
Come in. Come in.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.435
Mrs. Baxter.
Oh. Hey.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.471
Please tell Eve her ex-boyfriend
andrew said, "hello."

12:55.040 --> 12:58.243
And that
he hasn't moved on.

12:58.245 --> 13:00.111
At all.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.313
Uh, well, I'll tell Eve
that you said, "hello,"

13:02.315 --> 13:04.149
And for your sake,
I'll leave out the last part.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.386
Oh, my. Is that boy
wearing a dunce cap?

13:08.388 --> 13:10.255
[ chuckles ] oh, no.

13:10.257 --> 13:13.057
I could never get away with
being that insensitive to kids

13:13.059 --> 13:14.225
In this day and age.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.995
It's a genius cap.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.631
This genius
forgot to do his homework.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.466
Isn't that humiliating?

13:21.468 --> 13:23.268
Well, that's the kind
of question

13:23.270 --> 13:24.736
I would expect
from a genius.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.807
All right, thomas.
Your time is up.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.042
Next time, I'll make you sit
in the wobbly chair.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.479
It doesn't sound
like much,

13:34.481 --> 13:37.182
But after 20 minutes,
you just want to scream.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.416
Oh.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.485
It's like reggae.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.988
Uh, how can I help you,
mrs. Baxter?

13:43.990 --> 13:46.157
Uh, well, actually,
I'm here for Eve.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.593
Uh, she's --
how can I put this?

13:48.595 --> 13:51.529
She's -- she's not enjoying
her experience in your class.

13:51.531 --> 13:55.934
Well, fun isn't really
the objective in my classroom.

13:55.936 --> 13:59.204
That's why I removed
the bouncy house.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.639
No, w-what I mean is
she's frustrated.

14:01.641 --> 14:04.209
I mean, she's -- she's even
talking about a transfer.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.610
No, no.
She can't!

14:05.612 --> 14:07.712
I-I mean, uh...

14:07.714 --> 14:09.681
I-I purposely failed
the entrance exam

14:09.683 --> 14:11.182
For a.P. Calculus

14:11.184 --> 14:13.051
Just so I could be in here
with her.

14:13.053 --> 14:16.054
[ laughing ] oh, andrew.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.689
Please go.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.460
And you don't have to be
so...Desperate.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.530
Haven't you heard?
Your kind rules the world.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.632
You mean asthmatics?

14:29.735 --> 14:34.072
I'm, uh -- I'm sorry to hear
Eve's considering a transfer.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.875
She's, uh, one
of my best students.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.077
Well, then why does she keep
getting c's?

14:39.079 --> 14:41.045
Isn't there something
that she can do

14:41.047 --> 14:42.580
To get better grades
on your tests?

14:42.582 --> 14:46.818
Absolutely.
Get more of the answers right.

14:46.820 --> 14:50.688
I mean, what if she took
a retest of -- of the last test

14:50.690 --> 14:53.491
Or maybe, um, earned
some extra credit

14:53.493 --> 14:55.393
Or -- or something
to raise her grade?

14:55.395 --> 14:58.229
Ah, you're one of those.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.331
No, no, I'm not.
I-I --

15:00.333 --> 15:01.866
Wait, what?
One of what?

15:01.868 --> 15:03.601
One of those parents
who comes in here

15:03.603 --> 15:05.503
Demanding I give their kid
a better grade.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.505
Yeah, okay, all right.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.507
Well, if I'm one of those,
then I'm one of the good ones.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.843
Mrs. Baxter, I've been teaching
the same material

15:11.845 --> 15:14.045
The same way
for 40 years.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.047
Every year,
the grades go down

15:16.049 --> 15:18.549
And the pressure
from the parents goes up.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.219
But the math
stays the same.

15:21.221 --> 15:24.923
"a" squared plus "b" squared
equals...?

15:26.458 --> 15:28.760
"c" squared!

15:28.762 --> 15:31.596
I-I know that. I just --
I didn't know you were --

15:31.598 --> 15:33.431
Wanted -- never mind.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.601
I am not going to lower
my standards,

15:36.603 --> 15:39.704
And no amount
of parental coercion

15:39.706 --> 15:41.439
Is going
to change that.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.707
And you know why?

15:42.709 --> 15:44.375
"c" squared.

15:47.579 --> 15:49.247
Because every day,

15:49.249 --> 15:53.384
I drive back and forth
across the 19th street bridge,

15:53.386 --> 15:55.887
And every day, I pray

15:55.889 --> 15:58.423
That the men and women
who built that bridge

15:58.425 --> 15:59.924
Learned their math

15:59.926 --> 16:02.994
From teachers who demanded
the best from them.

16:02.996 --> 16:07.098
Uh, Eve has her heart set
on west point.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.634
She's not so interested
in building bridges

16:09.636 --> 16:11.202
As she is
in blowing them up.

16:12.838 --> 16:15.440
Come on. Isn't there
something you can do
to help her get an "a"?

16:15.442 --> 16:17.175
Yes.

16:17.177 --> 16:20.345
I can let her take geometry
from someone else.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.847
Mr. Jory's class.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.649
She'll like him.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.784
He's hip...

16:26.786 --> 16:28.920
Plays the banjo.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.797
Hey. Mike Baxter here
for outdoor man.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.265
Hey, check it out.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.001
Look at him,
scaling that thing

16:43.003 --> 16:44.869
Like a surefooted
mountain goat.

16:44.871 --> 16:48.539
The truth is
he's getting a little help.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.708
I'm climbing!

16:50.710 --> 16:52.710
He's basically doing nothing.

16:52.712 --> 16:56.214
I made it, mr. B.
I'm on top of the world!

16:56.216 --> 16:57.982
This is what America's come to.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.284
Real accomplishment
plays second fiddle

17:00.286 --> 17:02.487
To just feeling good
about ourselves --

17:02.489 --> 17:04.722
Feeling good
whether we earned it or not.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.657
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

17:06.659 --> 17:09.160
We love to say
America's number one.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.862
But are we?

17:10.864 --> 17:13.865
Our students rank 30th in math,
23rd in science,

17:13.867 --> 17:15.466
And 20th in reading.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.802
Well, what are we number one in?

17:17.804 --> 17:19.837
I'll tell you.
Self-esteem.

17:19.839 --> 17:23.574
Yeah. We're a nation
of confident idiots.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.743
It's our fault as parents.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.012
Our little darlings
scribble on a piece of paper,

17:28.014 --> 17:29.080
And we praise it.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.648
"oh, that's beautiful art."

17:30.650 --> 17:33.084
Really?
Green dog with eight legs?

17:33.086 --> 17:35.987
That shouldn't bump the domino's
coupon off the fridge.

17:35.989 --> 17:37.722
We demand our eggs be grade "a"

17:37.724 --> 17:39.924
While we give our kids
a free pass.

17:39.926 --> 17:43.227
We expect less from our children
than we do from our poultry.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.663
Let's stop babying
this generation, people,

17:45.665 --> 17:46.931
And sharpen them up!

17:46.933 --> 17:48.866
Oh, by the way,

17:48.868 --> 17:50.902
All hunting blades on sale
this week at outdoor man.

17:50.904 --> 17:53.104
Hey, come on, guys.
Coffee's on me.

17:53.106 --> 17:55.873
Wait.
How do I get down?

17:55.875 --> 17:58.342
Tell you what -- a kid from asia
would figure it out.

18:03.415 --> 18:06.050
So, I'll bet hardin's class
was easy to find.

18:06.052 --> 18:08.553
You just follow the sounds
of screaming children.
[ chuckles ]

18:08.555 --> 18:11.622
Yeah, you know, I saw
your friend andrew there.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.057
He really likes you.

18:13.059 --> 18:16.027
Yeah. He follows me around
at school.

18:16.029 --> 18:19.530
It's sort of a
"mary's little lamb" situation.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.132
I can see what you mean
about hardin.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.633
Not only
is he tough on kids,

18:22.635 --> 18:24.435
But he's not too crazy
about parents, either.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.938
Don't even get him started
on reggae.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.273
Hey, guys.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.641
Hey.
Eve: Hi.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.943
What's going on?

18:31.945 --> 18:35.246
Well, I went to see
hardin today.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.781
You know what, honey?

18:36.783 --> 18:38.116
He is a lot like you.
You would've loved him.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.453
Doesn't sound like
<i>you</i> did.
[ sighs ]

18:42.455 --> 18:45.156
If he reminds you of me,
that makes me wonder.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.325
Maybe this whole thing's
built on sand.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.960
Hmm.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.496
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.297
Well,
he signed Eve's transfer,

18:53.299 --> 18:55.166
But I want to run it
by you first,

18:55.168 --> 18:57.135
Because you felt
pretty strongly.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.937
I do feel strongly about it.
But this is Eve's decision.

18:59.939 --> 19:02.707
Really?
This isn't a trick?

19:03.842 --> 19:05.643
Oh.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.645
Goodbye, hardin.
Hello, banjo boy.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.014
[ imitates banjo playing ]

19:10.016 --> 19:12.250
Well, look at that.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.385
Looks like you got
what you wanted.

19:18.023 --> 19:19.957
Hey, wait, dad.
I'm sorry.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.192
But all joking aside,

19:21.194 --> 19:23.528
I have tried and tried
with this guy,

19:23.530 --> 19:25.630
And no matter how hard
I work, he's never
gonna give me an "a."

19:25.632 --> 19:27.098
So if I'm heading
towards a minefield,

19:27.100 --> 19:28.666
Isn't it better
to just go around it?

19:28.668 --> 19:31.369
What you're doing is
the smart and practical thing,

19:31.371 --> 19:33.037
But it's also
the easy thing,

19:33.039 --> 19:35.973
And I don't think the easy thing
is always the right thing.

19:35.975 --> 19:39.010
Well, I know
I'm disappointing you.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.946
Believe me,
it's not the easy thing.

19:46.618 --> 19:48.386
You're being
a little hard on Eve.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.454
You know, I look at her
as a diamond, right?

19:50.456 --> 19:52.290
You know, and a diamond

19:52.292 --> 19:54.091
Is just a piece of coal
that stuck it out.

19:55.494 --> 19:58.229
If she gets in the college
of her dreams, that's great,

19:58.231 --> 20:02.133
But I wish that she'd do it
as the diamond that she is.

20:02.135 --> 20:04.135
But a diamond
is also produced

20:04.137 --> 20:06.204
By withstanding
intense pressure.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.406
That's what Eve
just did.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.007
Honey,
she just stood up

20:10.009 --> 20:12.476
To the toughest, most important
person in her life.

20:12.478 --> 20:13.878
That's what a diamond is.

20:18.917 --> 20:20.918
Okay. That was
a good observation.

20:23.322 --> 20:25.156
Especially
coming from somebody

20:25.158 --> 20:27.158
That went to
<i>the</i> ohio state university.

20:37.035 --> 20:39.604
Hey, mr. Alzate.
Just a heads up.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.606
Jason grayson's mom
is here to see you.

20:41.608 --> 20:42.907
Yeah, all the guys
in the stockroom

20:42.909 --> 20:44.242
Think she's, um, a
[whistles]

20:44.244 --> 20:45.409
Blblblblb!

20:45.411 --> 20:46.611
[ chuckles ]

20:47.713 --> 20:49.247
If you've never seen
a cartoon,

20:49.249 --> 20:51.349
I-I probably looked
pretty foolish right there.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.784
I get it.
They think she's crazy, huh?

20:53.786 --> 20:56.954
You know why mrs. Grayson
is stopping by, Kyle? Hmm?

20:56.956 --> 21:00.057
She's meeting me
to go out on our date.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.026
A date?
Mm-hmm.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.262
Like people do when
they're a man and a woman?

21:04.264 --> 21:06.063
Yes, yes.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.898
She's a lovely,
caring woman,

21:07.900 --> 21:10.768
And I feel fortunate that
she's agreed to go out with me.

21:10.770 --> 21:14.672
I guess I should just,
uh, exit stage right.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.375
It's another
cartoon thing.

21:19.077 --> 21:20.111
Kyle.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.312
Ah.
Hello, eddie.

21:21.314 --> 21:22.580
Well, well, well, well.
Look at you.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.115
Shall we? Hmm?
[ chuckles ]

21:24.117 --> 21:26.384
You wearing the insoles
I got for you?

21:26.386 --> 21:28.452
Mm-hmm.
Really great for the back.
Was I right?

21:28.454 --> 21:30.655
Never felt better
or taller.
