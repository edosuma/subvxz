The city of Townsville
will drop to its knees

00:31.999 --> 00:38.003
when I, Mojo Jojo, unleash
my army of cybernetically
enhanced battle monkeys.

00:38.005 --> 00:41.340
They will cower and I,
Mojo Jojo, will laugh.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.474
(LAUGHS)

00:42.476 --> 00:44.309
And they, the people,
not the monkeys,

00:44.311 --> 00:47.980
will very much dislike
what I, Mojo Jojo, am doing.

00:47.982 --> 00:51.183
And I, Mojo Jojo,
will not care.

00:51.185 --> 00:54.153
Not so fast, Mojo!

00:54.155 --> 00:58.023
The Powerpuff Girls!
Who are always thwarting
my ingenious plans.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.091
But not today!

01:03.163 --> 01:05.064
Okay, you have thwarted
my ingenious plan.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.398
But you will never catch me!

01:06.400 --> 01:07.666
Oh, yeah?

01:10.036 --> 01:11.870
Give it up, Mojo!

01:18.379 --> 01:21.780
Now, you must excuse me
while I, Mojo Jojo,

01:21.782 --> 01:25.551
carry out my cybernetically
enhanced battle monkey plan
in another dimension

01:25.553 --> 01:31.757
I, Mojo Jojo, have discovered

about stopping villains!

01:31.759 --> 01:33.325

Hey, bro. Wanna hear me
beef the alphabet?
(LAUGHS)

01:52.413 --> 01:56.315

02:12.133 --> 02:15.067
Check out that hat, bro!
I love him so much!

02:15.069 --> 02:18.270
But will you still love me
when I, Mojo Jojo,

02:18.272 --> 02:21.974

cybernetically enhanced
battle monkeys?

02:21.976 --> 02:24.810
You're making a monkey army?

02:24.812 --> 02:27.813
So cool!
Can wese get in on that?

02:27.815 --> 02:31.183
You truly are superheroes
who do not fight villains.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.018
And you want to help me?

02:33.020 --> 02:35.787
Uh, spend the day

Who are the odd floating
color-coordinated children?

03:03.150 --> 03:04.683
The Powerpuff Girls!

03:05.218 --> 03:07.719
That's right.
How did you know?

03:07.721 --> 03:10.222
The voice! That voice.

03:10.224 --> 03:13.325
We've come from
another dimension looking
for a dangerous villain,

03:13.327 --> 03:14.660
Mojo Jojo!

03:14.662 --> 03:18.830
We have to do something.
Your parents
must be worried sick.

03:18.832 --> 03:19.965
What?

03:19.967 --> 03:21.867
Aw, don't be scared.

03:21.869 --> 03:25.370
We'll keep an eye on you
until your mommy and daddy
come pick you up.

03:25.372 --> 03:29.208
We don't need babysitters,
we need to stop Mojo Jojo!

03:36.850 --> 03:39.418
I'm Buttercup and
that's Bubbles and Blossom.

03:39.886 --> 03:44.389
Well, I'm Chico,
and that's Chewie and Chubby!

03:45.358 --> 03:47.392
What's wrong with these guys?

03:47.827 --> 03:49.695
Raven, don't joke like that.

03:49.697 --> 03:52.931
Their underdeveloped
baby brains can't process
your humor.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.267

-That's my jam!

04:11.751 --> 04:13.585
Should we have told
the others where we are?

04:13.587 --> 04:17.289
Nah, don't sweat it, bro.
I left a note saying
we were helping the monkeys.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.325
Look, they left a note.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.762
It says, "Help! Monkey!"

04:23.764 --> 04:26.365
(GASPS)
They are in the danger!

04:26.367 --> 04:28.734
(GROANS)
That's what we're
trying to tell you!

04:28.736 --> 04:33.905
And you've come here
for our help because
you're tiny, helpless babies.

04:33.907 --> 04:34.973

04:37.211 --> 04:39.044
That's right, you are.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.780
You can be anything you want
when you grow up.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.549
You guys aren't very good
at your jobs, are you?

04:44.551 --> 04:46.785
That sounds like a challenge.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.720
How did that sound
like a challenge?

04:48.722 --> 04:53.125
The babies wish
to determine which superhero
team is superior!

04:53.127 --> 04:56.595
Let's be clear.
This is not a competition.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.431
You want a competition?
You've got one!

04:59.433 --> 05:03.235
The Powerpuff Girls
