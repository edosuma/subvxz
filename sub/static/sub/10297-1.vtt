01:17.434 --> 01:20.601
You know, the boys are
upstairs working so hard,

01:20.601 --> 01:23.501
and this popcorn will make
a nice surprise for them.

01:23.501 --> 01:25.400
It's so easy to make too.

01:26.734 --> 01:30.868
Uh, Peggy, you're supposed
to move it around.

01:30.868 --> 01:32.534
Oh...

01:35.801 --> 01:37.167
Well, gee...

01:37.167 --> 01:39.601
Now it's not easy anymore.

01:39.601 --> 01:44.234
Peggy, did you know this says,
"Use before May the 11th, 1972"?

01:45.834 --> 01:47.501
Marcy, if you
read it carefully,

01:47.501 --> 01:53.200
it says, <i>"Best</i> if used
before May the 11th, 1972."

01:53.200 --> 01:55.234
Boys! Popcorn!

01:55.234 --> 01:57.167
[SIGHS]

01:57.167 --> 01:58.601
Can you believe it?

01:58.601 --> 02:01.033
This little treasure
was hiding in a box

02:01.033 --> 02:02.267
up in the attic.

02:03.601 --> 02:07.234
It was a wedding present
from Al's parents.

02:08.067 --> 02:09.467
They gave you popcorn?

02:09.467 --> 02:10.701
Yeah.

02:10.701 --> 02:12.634
Popcorn and Al.

02:12.634 --> 02:15.834
I made out like a bandit.

02:15.834 --> 02:18.267
Well, Steve's parents
gave us china

02:18.267 --> 02:19.400
and written instructions

02:19.400 --> 02:23.167
on how to make melon balls
for their son.

02:23.167 --> 02:25.634
It's the only way
he'll eat melon, you know.

02:25.634 --> 02:27.400
Yeah, men are so fussy.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.667
Do you know that after
we were first married,

02:29.667 --> 02:33.567
Al wouldn't eat
unless his food was warm.

02:34.901 --> 02:37.334
Okay, we've cleaned out
your garage,

02:37.334 --> 02:38.701
your back yard,
and your attic,

02:38.701 --> 02:40.067
so tomorrow
you're gonna help me

02:40.067 --> 02:41.767
clean out my garage,
right, Al?

02:41.767 --> 02:43.701
One...second.

02:43.701 --> 02:44.968
[GRUNTS]

02:45.667 --> 02:47.667
No.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.801
Now, Al, I hope that attic
is nice and clean

02:49.801 --> 02:51.534
for when mother
comes to stay.

02:51.534 --> 02:53.234
Oh, yeah,
the straw's been laid down.

02:53.234 --> 02:55.968
The trough's been built.

02:55.968 --> 02:58.100
All we need now
is a little glass of bourbon

02:58.100 --> 03:00.067
to put her teeth in,
and she'll be in,

03:00.067 --> 03:01.200
pardon the expression,

03:01.200 --> 03:02.467
hog heaven.

03:03.968 --> 03:06.367
Hey, popcorn!

03:10.367 --> 03:12.567
Marcy, I don't need you
to tell me what to eat.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.567
You're not my mother.

03:13.567 --> 03:14.801
If you were,

03:14.801 --> 03:17.067
you'd know how to make
a decent melon ball.

03:17.067 --> 03:18.200
Oh...

03:18.200 --> 03:20.334
[COUGHS]

03:20.334 --> 03:22.100
Mm! It's good.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.067
No, no, no, no, no.
No more popcorn

03:24.067 --> 03:26.100
till you put that junk
in the garbage.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.067
Junk? I got
a lot of good stuff here.

03:28.067 --> 03:30.200
I can use a lot of this.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.567
Steve, look what
she wants me to throw out.

03:35.501 --> 03:37.501
My hedge clippers.

03:38.601 --> 03:40.000
They disappeared one day
from my yard.

03:40.000 --> 03:40.901
How did you get them?

03:44.100 --> 03:45.934
Bud!

03:45.934 --> 03:46.801
Get down here!

03:49.634 --> 03:50.701
What, Dad?

03:50.701 --> 03:51.901
Did you take
these hedge clippers?

03:51.901 --> 03:53.334
Yes, Dad.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.434
You remember? You called
Mr. Rhoades up on the phone,

03:55.434 --> 03:56.834
and I slipped over
and took them?

04:01.400 --> 04:03.400
Well, don't ever
do it again.

04:03.400 --> 04:06.100
I'm sorry, Steve,
he must've misunderstood.

04:06.100 --> 04:08.868
Hey, that's
my car battery.

04:09.467 --> 04:11.501
[LAUGHS]

04:11.501 --> 04:13.100
Well, you can't
count that, Steve.

04:13.100 --> 04:16.100
That was before
we became friends.

04:16.100 --> 04:17.767
Hi, everybody.

04:17.767 --> 04:20.601
Oh, the greatest thing
happened at school today.

04:20.601 --> 04:22.267
The bus driver
had a nervous breakdown,

04:22.267 --> 04:24.868
so we had to drive the bus
ourselves,

04:24.868 --> 04:26.567
so, um, if anybody calls

04:26.567 --> 04:28.868
and accuses me of locking
the driver in the bathroom

04:28.868 --> 04:31.067
and taking the bus
on a joy ride,

04:31.067 --> 04:32.968
now you know it's not true.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.801
So, what is all
this junk anyways?

04:35.801 --> 04:38.267
It's not junk, Kel.
It's dad's life.

04:38.267 --> 04:40.434
And it's all in this
little box, isn't it, Dad?

04:40.434 --> 04:41.868
You bet it is, son.

04:41.868 --> 04:44.334
Hey, now, look at this.

04:44.334 --> 04:46.934
"MVP, Pop Warner Football."

04:46.934 --> 04:49.534
I was a little younger
than you when I got this, son.

04:49.534 --> 04:51.701
"All-star Little League
Shortstop."

04:51.701 --> 04:53.801
Oh, man.

04:53.801 --> 04:55.300
"All-City Football."

04:55.300 --> 04:56.300
Huh?

04:56.300 --> 04:58.100
Then I met your mom.

05:00.067 --> 05:04.501
"Co-ed Softball...
Participant Award."

05:04.501 --> 05:08.133
"Rookie Of The Year
Shoe Salesman, 1968."

05:08.133 --> 05:10.334
You notice
how they're getting smaller?

05:10.334 --> 05:13.767
Everything about him is.

05:13.767 --> 05:15.968
Oh, yeah, and I'm sure
you didn't have anything

05:15.968 --> 05:18.133
to do with that,
either, did you?

05:19.734 --> 05:22.167
Well, that's the end
of my trophies.

05:22.167 --> 05:24.100
Gee, Al, what
a testament to a...

05:24.901 --> 05:27.000
loser.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.200
Thanks, Steve.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.934
No, really, you'll never
relive this glory.

05:30.934 --> 05:33.767
God, you must feel low.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.601
I mean, I didn't have that much
of an athletic past--

05:36.601 --> 05:38.334
Oh, come on, Steve,
you must have got

05:38.334 --> 05:40.901
the "Running Home To Mommy"
trophy once or twice.

05:42.367 --> 05:43.567
Well, if I did win one,

05:43.567 --> 05:45.834
I'm sure it's somewhere
in your box.

05:45.834 --> 05:50.601
The point, however,
is my life is...getting better.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.634
I've got the best
trophy in the whole world

05:52.634 --> 05:54.734
right here
to share it with me.

05:54.734 --> 05:56.701
Couldn't you just
eat him up?

05:56.701 --> 05:58.601
Nah, Peg'd probably
just serve him cold.

06:00.467 --> 06:02.901
Hey! Look at this!

06:02.901 --> 06:04.634
The book that inspired
my whole life.

06:04.634 --> 06:06.901
 <i>Wanda The Preppy Hippo?</i>

06:06.901 --> 06:11.167
 <i>The Little Engine</i>
 <i>That Could.</i>

06:11.167 --> 06:12.634
Is this my book, Al?

06:12.634 --> 06:14.234
No, it's not,
and I can prove it.

06:14.234 --> 06:15.434
Look here.

06:15.434 --> 06:19.601
Yeah. "Property
of the Oakwood Library."

06:19.601 --> 06:22.000
Uh, gee, Al,
it's a little overdue.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.133
1957 is past,
isn't it?

06:25.133 --> 06:27.033
Can you believe that, Kel?

06:27.033 --> 06:29.334
Dad was alive in 1957.

06:29.334 --> 06:32.634
I didn't even think
it was a real year.

06:32.634 --> 06:34.701
Wow, what memories
this brings back.

06:34.701 --> 06:35.934
Yeah. Eh...

06:38.801 --> 06:42.133
You can't
throw this away!

06:42.133 --> 06:43.300
Well, Steve, it's a book.

06:43.300 --> 06:46.033
He certainly can't read it.

06:46.033 --> 06:47.634
Al!

06:47.634 --> 06:49.434
This is literature.

06:49.434 --> 06:50.434
Don't you understand?

06:50.434 --> 06:52.501
You have to bring
this book back.

06:52.501 --> 06:53.868
Libraries all over the country

06:53.868 --> 06:56.334
are suffering from
a shortage of books.

06:56.334 --> 06:59.501
And a book is fuel
for a hungry mind.

06:59.501 --> 07:01.267
Ah, books
are for idiots.

07:01.267 --> 07:04.567
I mean...you can learn
everything you need

07:04.567 --> 07:08.934
from a movie or a date.

07:08.934 --> 07:13.167
Well, the world
needs bimbos too.

07:13.167 --> 07:16.100
Al, just take the book back.

07:16.100 --> 07:18.467
I've got bad memories
of that library.

07:18.467 --> 07:22.200
Aw, honey, is that because
all the other kids were reading?

07:23.634 --> 07:25.234
No.

07:25.234 --> 07:26.667
It's because of the librarian...

07:26.667 --> 07:29.234
Miss De Groot.

07:29.234 --> 07:32.434
God, she was fat and old and...

07:32.434 --> 07:34.300
fat.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.634
I remember she had
this cup of coffee on her desk,

07:36.634 --> 07:39.033
and she'd always be spooning
mounds of sugar into it

07:39.033 --> 07:40.234
from a jar.

07:40.234 --> 07:41.367
When she'd stir it,

07:41.367 --> 07:42.701
it would make
these clanking sounds

07:42.701 --> 07:44.901
like chains on a ghost.

07:44.901 --> 07:47.567
A fat ghost.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.868
God, she hated me.

07:49.868 --> 07:52.334
[CLANKING]

08:10.968 --> 08:12.701
Well...

08:12.701 --> 08:15.067
young Mr. Bundy.

08:16.868 --> 08:19.434
The devil boy.

08:24.434 --> 08:26.667
You'd like to check these out,
would you?

08:26.667 --> 08:28.167
Well, I'm afraid you can't.

08:28.167 --> 08:29.701
Do you know why?

08:29.701 --> 08:31.367
Because I didn't bring you
French fries

08:31.367 --> 08:33.501
like the other boys do?

08:33.501 --> 08:36.701
You're a bad seed, Bundy.

08:36.701 --> 08:37.767
You can't have these books

08:37.767 --> 08:40.200
because you are
consistently overdue,

08:40.200 --> 08:42.100
you never have the money to pay,

08:42.100 --> 08:46.000
and looking at you now,
I doubt you ever will.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.400
I'll bring 'em back,
I promise.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.801
You always promise,

08:48.801 --> 08:50.634
but you don't follow through.

08:50.634 --> 08:53.100
And that, in a nutshell,
is your problem.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.100
Make a promise, keep a promise.

08:55.100 --> 08:59.000
Yeah, yeah,
bake a pie, eat a pie.

09:02.801 --> 09:04.167
Can I have the books now?

09:04.167 --> 09:05.901
I've got a book report
due tomorrow.

09:05.901 --> 09:08.000
You may take just one book.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.200
Hey, be fair.
Can you eat just one pig?

09:16.000 --> 09:19.167
You're a horrible
little boy.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.567
You'll never amount
to a hill of beans.

09:21.567 --> 09:23.467
And I wish that
on you, Bundy:

09:23.467 --> 09:25.801
to be the failure you deserve.

09:26.868 --> 09:28.467
And take that hand
out of your pants.

09:28.467 --> 09:29.767
It's a filthy little habit.

09:32.100 --> 09:36.000
Now, I'm going to let you have
 <i>The Little Engine That Could</i>

09:36.000 --> 09:38.267
on the basis that you might
learn something,

09:38.267 --> 09:41.634
though we both know you won't.

09:41.634 --> 09:44.400
Do you think anyone
can teach you anything?

09:44.400 --> 09:46.133
Well, you've just taught me

09:46.133 --> 09:50.334
that even the slightest movement
can make a fat person sweat.

09:52.734 --> 09:54.067
Three days.

09:54.067 --> 09:56.634
You have three days
to bring this back.

09:56.634 --> 09:58.534
Promise you'll bring it
back on time.

09:58.534 --> 09:59.667
I promise.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.467
Oh, that means
almost nothing.

10:02.467 --> 10:04.000
But if you don't,
remember,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.934
I'll be waiting for you.

10:10.434 --> 10:13.434
Boy... She hates you, Al.

10:13.434 --> 10:16.467
I swear, one day, I'm gonna
take that bowl of sugar

10:16.467 --> 10:18.934
and pour the whole thing
down her gas tank.

10:22.701 --> 10:25.300
My life's gotta get
better than this.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.734
That's when I first learned
that redheads can kill you.

10:38.734 --> 10:41.567
Come on, Al,
that was 30 years ago.

10:41.567 --> 10:43.334
The woman's dead.

10:43.334 --> 10:46.234
No one can eat
that much sugar and live.

10:46.234 --> 10:48.501
Take it back.

10:48.501 --> 10:50.367
Face your fears, Al.

10:50.367 --> 10:53.634
Be a man and return
 <i>The Little Engine That Could.</i>

11:16.200 --> 11:19.567
You're alive!

11:19.567 --> 11:24.501
And you owe us $2163.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.467
Wait a second,

11:29.467 --> 11:33.567
you're charging me $2000
for an overdue library book?

11:33.567 --> 11:37.234
Perhaps if you didn't ignore
the overdue notices we sent you

11:37.234 --> 11:38.534
for the first 10 years,

11:38.534 --> 11:40.000
you wouldn't be
in this pickle.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.734
Sit down.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.801
You made me a promise
and you didn't keep it,

11:48.801 --> 11:50.734
so now you must pay the piper.

11:50.734 --> 11:52.067
For you see,

11:52.067 --> 11:56.734
even the road to ruin
has its tollgate.

11:56.734 --> 12:02.167
Now...will you be paying
in cash or food stamps?

12:03.701 --> 12:06.000
Can't we make
a little deal here?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.434
I'll tell you what.

12:07.434 --> 12:11.000
Suppose I tape a doughnut
to my driver's license

12:11.000 --> 12:13.267
and slip it to you...

12:13.267 --> 12:14.534
You give it back,

12:14.534 --> 12:19.033
and the doughnut just
mysteriously...disappears?

12:20.834 --> 12:24.767
Could it be that you don't
have the $2000?

12:24.767 --> 12:26.534
Could it be that I was correct

12:26.534 --> 12:30.033
when I made and educated guess
that you would fail in life?

12:30.033 --> 12:32.601
Could it be that the nails
that hold your chair together

12:32.601 --> 12:35.167
are from the planet Krypton?

12:37.501 --> 12:40.234
Oh, look. It's after 12.

12:40.234 --> 12:43.100
That's another 20 cents
you owe us.

12:43.100 --> 12:46.901
Well, it just so happens that
I returned that book years ago.

12:46.901 --> 12:48.334
I'd remember if you did.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.334
You weren't here.

12:49.334 --> 12:50.334
I'm always here.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.601
Not that day.

12:51.601 --> 12:56.834
I believe that was
the day of the big cake heist.

12:56.834 --> 12:59.534
You were rounded up
for questioning.

12:59.534 --> 13:01.200
Perhaps a policeman's
rubber hose

13:01.200 --> 13:02.634
can get to the truth.

13:02.634 --> 13:04.067
Wait, I'll just go
to the shelves

13:04.067 --> 13:06.234
and get that book
and prove it to you.

13:06.234 --> 13:07.968
We'll both go.

13:07.968 --> 13:10.601
So, Mr. Bundy, what
do you do for a living,

13:10.601 --> 13:13.234
presuming you're not still
in high school?

13:15.133 --> 13:18.334
Librarian hit man.

13:18.334 --> 13:20.667
I thought so.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.467
Well, let's see. I...

13:22.467 --> 13:25.868
I know I put it here
somewhere, uh...

13:25.868 --> 13:27.567
Is that a duck?

13:27.567 --> 13:29.868
The book, Bundy.
The book.

13:29.868 --> 13:33.067
Yeah, maybe,
it could be, uh...

a lot of memories.

13:48.033 --> 13:49.601
You planted that in there.

13:49.601 --> 13:51.234
Prove it, De Groot.

13:51.234 --> 13:54.267
[LAUGHS]

13:54.267 --> 13:55.467
A loser?

13:55.467 --> 13:58.200
I think not.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.968
So I paid a little fine,

14:05.968 --> 14:07.968
I apologized, that was it.

14:07.968 --> 14:09.000
Aw, see, Al?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.601
You were worried
over nothing.

14:10.601 --> 14:11.834
Yep, you're right.

low enough?

Oh, I think

for all our young readers,

it was entrapment,

Oh, children, quiet down,
or you'll wind up like this man.

19:24.167 --> 19:26.100
You know, Mr. Bundy...

19:26.100 --> 19:28.701
I've worked at
this library for 44 years.

19:28.701 --> 19:32.701
I was eligible for retirement
three years ago.

19:32.701 --> 19:34.267
You know why I stayed?

19:35.167 --> 19:37.367
You learned to eat books?

19:37.367 --> 19:40.200
You're a horrible little boy.

19:40.200 --> 19:43.300
I kept this job
for one reason...

19:43.300 --> 19:46.400
I knew I'd nail you
and I did.

19:46.400 --> 19:49.567
Pat Garrett got Billy The Kid,

19:49.567 --> 19:52.000
and I finally got you.

19:53.667 --> 19:56.601
Today is my last day.

19:56.601 --> 19:58.334
You know, it's funny...

19:58.334 --> 20:00.601
I could have given you
amnesty on the book.

20:00.601 --> 20:03.000
I would have for anybody else...

20:03.000 --> 20:05.968
but I always hated you.

20:07.667 --> 20:11.000
Is it wrong
to hate a 9-year-old boy?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.934
No.

20:12.934 --> 20:15.234
Not when that boy is you.

20:15.234 --> 20:17.634
It's the joy of my life
to see you grow up

20:17.634 --> 20:19.868
like I always knew you would:

20:19.868 --> 20:22.968

20:22.968 --> 20:26.400
Today, when I get
in my car

20:26.400 --> 20:28.834
and leave this place
for the last time,

20:28.834 --> 20:30.567

I'm a loser.

a stinking job that I hate,

20:41.701 --> 20:44.000

that doesn't respect me,

20:47.567 --> 20:49.734
Well, that may mean
loser to you,

20:49.734 --> 20:52.334

20:52.334 --> 20:53.701
Every morning when I wake up,

20:53.701 --> 20:55.901
I know it's not
going to get any better

20:55.901 --> 20:58.434
until I go back to sleep again.

20:58.434 --> 20:59.868
So I get up,

20:59.868 --> 21:03.868
have my watered-down Tang
and still-frozen Pop Tart,

21:03.868 --> 21:06.601
get in my car,
with no upholstery, no gas

21:06.601 --> 21:08.267
and six more payments,

21:08.267 --> 21:09.467
to fight traffic

21:09.467 --> 21:11.567
just for the privilege
of putting cheap shoes

21:11.567 --> 21:16.133
on the cloven hooves
of people like you.

21:16.133 --> 21:19.200
I'll never play football
like I thought I would.

21:19.200 --> 21:22.434
I'll never know the touch
of a beautiful woman.

21:22.434 --> 21:24.734
And I'll never again
know the joy of driving

21:24.734 --> 21:27.334
without a bag on my head.

21:27.334 --> 21:29.801
But I'm not a loser,

21:29.801 --> 21:31.634
because despite it all,

21:31.634 --> 21:33.300
me and every other guy

21:33.300 --> 21:35.501
who will never be
what he wanted to be,

21:35.501 --> 21:38.267

what we don't want to be

21:38.267 --> 21:41.067
40 hours a week for life.

21:41.067 --> 21:44.100
And the fact that I haven't put
a gun in my mouth,

21:44.100 --> 21:46.033
you pudding of a woman,

21:46.033 --> 21:48.834
makes me a winner!

21:57.033 --> 21:58.601
No, Mr. Bundy,

21:58.601 --> 22:00.701
that's what makes you a loser.

22:00.701 --> 22:03.534
You see, you could've made
something of your life,

22:03.534 --> 22:05.167
I suppose,

22:05.167 --> 22:06.968
but you never followed through.

22:06.968 --> 22:09.601
That's always been your problem.

22:09.601 --> 22:11.434
Like I always told you:

22:11.434 --> 22:14.234
Make a promise, keep a promise.

22:14.234 --> 22:16.801
And maybe if you did that
just once,

22:16.801 --> 22:18.200
you'd be a winner.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.267
Thank you,
Miss De Groot.

22:21.267 --> 22:22.734
As a matter of fact,

promises right now.
