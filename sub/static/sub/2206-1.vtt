<i>A CINEMA SERVICE

01:11.155 --> 01:12.990
<i>One man against 14 men</i>

01:13.199 --> 01:15.993
<i>Do you think this is
just one man's bluff?</i>

02:06.418 --> 02:10.047
This actually happened 23 years ago
in Youngju, Gyeongbuk province

02:10.131 --> 02:12.299
He took down 14 men alone

02:12.383 --> 02:13.843
This is the guy

02:14.343 --> 02:18.180
Do you ever wonder what happened
to the best fighters of your school days?

02:18.347 --> 02:20.015
We have the answer for you

02:20.015 --> 02:21.475
Legendary Fighter

02:22.101 --> 02:23.477
We have our first contestant,
Mr. Kim Bong-chul

02:23.477 --> 02:25.312
<i>Kim Bong-chul Owns fried chicken restaurant We
have our</i> first <i>contestant, Mr. Kim Bong-chul</i>

02:25.312 --> 02:27.606
<i>Kim Bong-chul
Owns fried chicken restaurant</i>

02:28.482 --> 02:30.526
The legendary 14 to 1 fighter

02:31.068 --> 02:34.780
Let's check out his fighting skills

02:35.281 --> 02:38.951
A two minute fight test with
a professional mixed martial arts athlete

02:39.076 --> 02:43.455
Jason Kim, the first Asian person to win
IFC Heavyweight Champion

02:43.455 --> 02:45.374
will be tonight's commentator and a judge
for today's bout

02:45.374 --> 02:46.250
Jason?

02:46.333 --> 02:51.088
Hello. Nice to meet you
I'm Jason

02:51.839 --> 02:52.923
Today we have

02:52.923 --> 02:57.511
Mixed Martial Arts Warrior FC
Middleweight Champion Jung Sang-ho

02:57.761 --> 02:58.554
Fight

02:59.471 --> 03:00.723
Rough blows

03:00.764 --> 03:02.641
He looks like a wild buffalo

03:02.641 --> 03:03.934
What do you think, Jason?

03:04.101 --> 03:05.436
He looks more like a cow

03:14.778 --> 03:18.240
Kim takes a middle kick and falls

03:18.699 --> 03:21.577
Is he really the legendary
14 to 1 man?

03:21.619 --> 03:24.830
I think he was one of the 14 men

03:29.585 --> 03:31.170
A takedown!

03:31.462 --> 03:34.548
Jung doesn't give the opponent
a second to breathe today

03:34.548 --> 03:36.467
For contestants with
no basics like him

03:36.467 --> 03:38.761
- It's better for them to end it quickly
- Stop, stop!

03:39.595 --> 03:40.304
<i>End of Fight</i>

03:40.304 --> 03:41.430
The referee calls for a stop

03:41.430 --> 03:43.015
<i>Legend Verification Failed!
The referee calls for</i> a <i>stop</i>

03:49.605 --> 03:50.522
Yo!

04:18.926 --> 04:24.348
He was in high school when he took down
a crime organization alone

04:24.765 --> 04:27.810
From Ajoongri, Jeonju

04:28.227 --> 04:30.479
Legend of the Legends

04:31.105 --> 04:34.066
Today's second contestant,
Mr. Park Chul-soo

04:36.360 --> 04:39.697
Unlike the last contestant,
he's got his basics down

04:39.863 --> 04:41.740
His weight shift in the lower body
is good

04:41.740 --> 04:45.536
When he throws a punch,
his feet are on toe-heel line

04:55.713 --> 04:58.382
A right hook!
That was a direct hit

04:58.507 --> 04:58.799
<i>Legend Verification Failed!</i>

04:58.799 --> 05:00.592
<i>Legend Verification Failed!
Park goes</i> down

05:00.676 --> 05:02.761
- Another legend dies
- Are you okay?

05:02.886 --> 05:04.638
Leave him. He'll live

05:08.434 --> 05:09.893
A High kick!

05:10.436 --> 05:12.521
Our third contestant,
Mr. Na Hyuk-soon

05:12.521 --> 05:15.899
Is it because of his good physical strength?
He's resilient

05:16.108 --> 05:18.277
It's been over a minute

05:21.780 --> 05:24.033
A very strong takedown

05:25.701 --> 05:28.912
He's doing a choke
Will Mr. Na hold up?

05:28.912 --> 05:30.372
I think he should give up

05:30.414 --> 05:32.624
It blocks the blood flow to the brain

05:32.624 --> 05:34.418
He could die

05:34.585 --> 05:37.004
Na is still holding up

05:37.129 --> 05:39.381
Mr. Na, please give up

05:39.381 --> 05:40.841
You could die

05:40.924 --> 05:42.718
I think he won't give up

05:42.926 --> 05:44.094
or is he?

05:44.511 --> 05:46.680
Is he?

05:47.222 --> 05:48.724
Is he?

05:48.807 --> 05:50.476
Two minutes are up

05:50.476 --> 05:52.436
- Yes
- Mr. Na is amazing

05:52.436 --> 05:54.730
He's the only contestant
to endure the two minutes today

05:54.730 --> 05:55.439
<i>End of Fight</i>

05:55.439 --> 05:56.440
<i>End of Fight

05:56.440 --> 05:58.942
<i>Legend Verification Successful

06:00.277 --> 06:03.906
The last in our program is
a fight between two legends

06:03.906 --> 06:05.991
for the prize money of $20,000

06:06.283 --> 06:08.452
The three minute Round 3 has begun

06:08.494 --> 06:11.955
Their skills are both great,
but they're armed with tenacity

06:11.955 --> 06:13.707
It's so gruesome

06:13.791 --> 06:15.376
It's a fierce slugfest

06:15.542 --> 06:17.503
It's an extraordinarily exciting match

06:17.753 --> 06:20.464
Who will win this week's $20,000?

06:20.464 --> 06:22.299
Both contestants won't back down

06:22.299 --> 06:24.134
They just won't yield

06:27.221 --> 06:31.308
<i>FISTS OF LEGEND</i>

07:02.256 --> 07:04.174
This noodle dish is delicious

07:04.758 --> 07:06.677
Thank you

07:07.845 --> 07:09.096
Did you know?

07:11.098 --> 07:14.101
The better they fight,
the better they cook

07:16.103 --> 07:18.897
I heard you were really famous
back in high school

07:19.356 --> 07:23.652
You against five South Seoul High's
best fighters is a legend

07:23.944 --> 07:25.737
I already said no

07:25.737 --> 07:27.698
Why did you come all the way here?

07:27.781 --> 07:30.534
They keep calling in

07:32.244 --> 07:34.705
I don't know who those
crazy people are

07:34.746 --> 07:38.041
But I wasn't some school bully

07:38.459 --> 07:41.128
If you came here for that,
don't pay and just leave

07:42.045 --> 07:45.048
How can I not pay for this
delicious bowl of noodles?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.759
$20,000 for one week's prize money
It's quite big

07:47.759 --> 07:49.720
<i>Legendary Fighter, Producer Hang Kyu-min.
$20,000 for one week's prize money. It's quite big</i>

07:50.053 --> 07:51.889
You don't have too many customers anyway

07:51.930 --> 07:53.932
I already told you I won't do it

07:54.057 --> 07:55.767
A broadcasting company
won't take no for an answer

07:55.767 --> 07:57.019
Please go

07:57.728 --> 08:00.898
If I lacked conviction,

08:00.939 --> 08:03.817
would I have made a rough show
like Legendary Fighter?

08:03.901 --> 08:05.444
I haven't seen
I don't know

08:05.444 --> 08:10.407
If I lacked conviction about you,
would I be here right now?

08:10.616 --> 08:12.993
How should I know?

08:13.076 --> 08:16.538
I think I can challenge
myself to win that $20,000

08:16.705 --> 08:20.459
When you have conviction about yourself,
please call me

08:21.126 --> 08:23.754
A man with pride is
the most beautiful man

08:25.506 --> 08:26.757
Whatever

08:32.679 --> 08:34.264
- Thank you
- Thank you

08:34.347 --> 08:35.765
He'll call soon

08:35.849 --> 08:38.352
I'm sorry
It was our job to do it

08:38.727 --> 08:41.938
A man looks most incompetent
when he has to say sorry

08:41.938 --> 08:43.023
Let's go

08:56.745 --> 09:00.624
Yes, mother
I'm at the restaurant

09:02.292 --> 09:03.460
NOW?

09:03.752 --> 09:05.337
How have you been?

09:06.630 --> 09:07.798
How are you, girl?

09:07.839 --> 09:11.301
What took you so long?
The food is cold now

09:11.552 --> 09:14.137
He never got the concept of time

09:14.221 --> 09:16.306
I came as fast as I could

09:16.974 --> 09:18.267
Get a bowl of rice-cake soup

09:18.600 --> 09:21.853
Hey, Soo-bin
What are you doing here?

09:21.853 --> 09:23.480
Why did you come home so early?

09:24.022 --> 09:25.274
Huh?

09:28.151 --> 09:30.487
What's wrong?

09:30.779 --> 09:32.030
You want a drink?

09:32.823 --> 09:34.324
No, no

09:34.700 --> 09:38.036
Why not? You quit drinking
after your wife died? Loser

09:38.161 --> 09:39.454
How did you know?

09:39.705 --> 09:41.957
You're so bad

09:44.042 --> 09:46.128
Soo-bin, come and eat with me

09:46.587 --> 09:48.630
I guess he's a really special guest

09:48.630 --> 09:50.591
It's like catering a buffet
every time he comes

09:50.591 --> 09:52.092
Try some stir-fried noodles

09:52.092 --> 09:53.510
It's very good

09:53.510 --> 09:56.888
Mother, don't make all these for me

09:56.888 --> 09:58.307
You girls stop too

09:58.307 --> 10:00.851
You must be happy getting
all the love from your mother-in-law

10:02.227 --> 10:06.690
If you go home hungry,
I won't be able to sleep well tonight

10:07.983 --> 10:10.277
This is so delicious

10:11.194 --> 10:13.030
Soo-bin, come here
Let's eat together

10:13.363 --> 10:14.531
Come down

10:14.906 --> 10:16.366
Talk to him while you eat

10:18.910 --> 10:21.079
Did Soo-bin do something wrong?

10:24.791 --> 10:26.501
You want me to tell him?

10:26.501 --> 10:27.961
Leave me alone

10:29.338 --> 10:31.798
Don't you dare throw a fit

10:31.882 --> 10:34.384
If you don't want to talk,
at least come and eat

10:36.219 --> 10:38.055
You have some free time
tomorrow morning?

10:39.139 --> 10:41.433
Tomorrow?
Why?

10:41.433 --> 10:43.143
You got time or not?

10:43.518 --> 10:47.564
I do
I will make time

10:49.733 --> 10:50.942
What are you doing?

10:51.151 --> 10:53.487
Stop it, dad

10:59.785 --> 11:03.246
Good job raising your kid

11:04.373 --> 11:06.667
What do you do for a living?

11:08.001 --> 11:10.045
I run a small restaurant

11:10.420 --> 11:14.591
Did she learn to use the pen like a knife
from her father?

11:14.716 --> 11:15.842
I'm sorry

11:15.926 --> 11:19.388
I'll pay for the hospital bill
and apologize sincerely

11:19.596 --> 11:21.890
Please let my daughter attend school

11:21.890 --> 11:24.559
When I get out of here,
that bitch is dead

11:24.559 --> 11:25.769
Eun-seo

11:26.103 --> 11:28.438
No, sir
It's all my fault

11:28.480 --> 11:30.273
I didn't raise her right

11:30.273 --> 11:31.942
Whatever

11:55.340 --> 11:58.260
I'm happy that you have a dream

12:05.350 --> 12:07.018
Why did you fight with her?

12:09.813 --> 12:13.734
If I were you, I would've stab her
with a fountain pen

12:15.110 --> 12:19.448
You only got a half of my genetics
That's why you're nice

12:19.948 --> 12:24.453
If you stabbed someone with a fountain pen,
you could've killed someone

12:25.829 --> 12:27.581
Do you think this is funny?

12:27.706 --> 12:28.623
No

12:28.665 --> 12:31.001
If you got money,
buy me a fountain pen

12:31.001 --> 12:33.170
so I can kill all the annoying
people in my way

12:36.965 --> 12:38.592
Do you have the money?

12:38.925 --> 12:40.177
Of course

12:40.343 --> 12:42.345
I heard that you can barely
pay your rent for the restaurant

12:42.345 --> 12:45.140
Who said that?
I have so many customers these days

12:49.644 --> 12:51.021
I guess you know

13:04.618 --> 13:05.702
Hello

13:06.203 --> 13:07.412
Yes, this is he

13:08.955 --> 13:10.540
Legendary Fighter?

13:10.874 --> 13:12.584
You know Mr. Lim Deok-kyu?

13:12.876 --> 13:14.628
Your high school friend
who runs a noodle shop

13:14.836 --> 13:18.215
I heard that you two were rivals
in Sadang high school

13:18.632 --> 13:23.512
<i>How do you feel about fighting
a great ringside match in 25 years?</i>

13:24.054 --> 13:26.431
Mr. Lim agreed to be on the show

13:26.515 --> 13:30.393
I don't know who told you this

13:30.393 --> 13:33.980
But I'm just a regular office employee
This is absurd

13:34.231 --> 13:36.274
I'm far from being violent

13:40.070 --> 13:41.071
I have to go now

13:41.738 --> 13:43.406
- Call the police
- Okay

13:53.291 --> 13:59.798
The bitches are brainwashed with
communist newspaper and Twitter

14:00.090 --> 14:02.926
They think an entrepreneur is
a fucking piece of shit

14:17.023 --> 14:17.941
Manager Lee

14:17.941 --> 14:18.775
Yes

14:19.276 --> 14:22.612
Young people these days
have no fucking morale

14:22.612 --> 14:26.700
Don't people get a bit aggressive
when they get drunk?

14:28.577 --> 14:29.703
Right, Mr. Park?

14:29.786 --> 14:32.414
That's true, President Son

14:43.675 --> 14:47.429
Mountain man wore a cloud hat

14:47.637 --> 14:51.766
He flew like a butterfly

14:51.975 --> 14:55.979
He approached quietly

14:56.438 --> 14:57.731
Which room is it?

14:57.731 --> 14:58.982
It's room number one

15:00.483 --> 15:01.985
Go bring the boss

15:01.985 --> 15:02.986
Yes, sir

15:07.198 --> 15:08.116
Sang-hoon

15:08.116 --> 15:09.075
Yes

15:09.826 --> 15:11.453
Take care of it

15:18.376 --> 15:20.378
<i>The cumulative prize money
of $40,000</i>

15:20.462 --> 15:22.839
<i>The cumulative prize of $40, 000
He has won second time in a raw</i>

15:22.839 --> 15:26.134
<i>Going for the $60,000
is Mr. Choi Joong-man also known as Mr. Turtle</i>

15:26.301 --> 15:29.512
<i>Mr. Turtle is dominating the match</i>

15:31.181 --> 15:33.058
<i>He's got superhuman strength</i>

15:33.058 --> 15:35.810
He tramples all over his opponent

15:35.810 --> 15:36.686
Get up

15:36.728 --> 15:39.397
- Is he really an office worker?
- Get up

15:39.397 --> 15:41.691
He looks like a professional athlete

15:41.775 --> 15:44.235
How could you compare him to us?

15:51.034 --> 15:52.494
A finishing blow!

15:52.494 --> 15:56.039
For the first time in this program,
he's going for the third win

15:57.958 --> 15:58.875
Wait

15:58.875 --> 16:01.127
Isn't a soccer kick against the rule?

16:01.252 --> 16:02.087
Mr. Turtle

16:02.087 --> 16:04.839
- Please stop
- Stop, stop!

16:04.881 --> 16:06.091
What's wrong with him?

16:06.091 --> 16:08.426
He ignores the referee
Mr. Turtle is going berserk

16:08.426 --> 16:10.720
- Hurry and stop him
- Stop, stop!

16:11.429 --> 16:13.098
He's brutal

16:13.390 --> 16:14.557
This is not a bout

16:14.557 --> 16:17.394
Choi is trying to afflict pain
to his opponent

16:17.435 --> 16:19.729
This is an insult to the sacred ring

16:19.854 --> 16:22.857
He's no legend
He needs to be disqualified

16:23.066 --> 16:26.778
<i>He loses by disqualification</i>

16:26.778 --> 16:29.990
<i>Choi fouls and loses his chance
to win the third win</i>

16:30.240 --> 16:32.909
<i>Choi Joong-man loses by disqualification
There goes his $60,000</i>

16:32.909 --> 16:33.868
<i>There goes his $60,000</i>

16:37.038 --> 16:40.709
<i>Sadang High Legend</i>

16:42.877 --> 16:44.879
Mr. Lim
You're a true man

16:45.588 --> 16:46.423
What?

16:46.506 --> 16:48.258
You're very manly

16:48.967 --> 16:50.093
Hello

16:50.760 --> 16:51.928
Hello

16:54.514 --> 16:56.433
- Please follow me
- Okay

17:27.464 --> 17:32.218
Are you a national representative?

17:33.553 --> 17:34.846
Something like that

17:36.014 --> 17:39.392
Let's shake hands
I'm Seo Kang-kuk

17:41.644 --> 17:43.104
Lim Deok-kyu here

17:43.313 --> 17:44.731
You own a business?

17:45.523 --> 17:46.483
Yes

17:46.483 --> 17:47.734
A restaurant?

17:48.026 --> 17:49.194
What?

17:50.820 --> 17:53.198
I can tell a lot by looking at a person

17:54.866 --> 17:58.787
Let's talk about that later
and start the fight

17:58.828 --> 17:59.829
Fight

18:04.292 --> 18:05.376
Seriously.

18:05.460 --> 18:08.046
I was a member of
the National Intelligence Service

18:08.338 --> 18:11.382
Why don't you believe me?

18:11.966 --> 18:14.219
Isn't National Intelligence story
going a bit too far?

18:14.427 --> 18:15.720
Can you get the content rating approved?

18:16.221 --> 18:19.265
Interesting. We can omit
that part for the ratings board

18:21.017 --> 18:26.064
I'm the victim of the power struggle
of the National Intelligence Service

18:26.314 --> 18:30.443
I was always proud of my job
and got axed suddenly

18:30.735 --> 18:35.782
Why should the agents get fired
when a new administration comes in?

18:35.865 --> 18:39.119
Do we live in the 1970s
like the Silmido soldiers?

18:40.870 --> 18:45.208
You keep saying that
you were a secret agent

18:45.208 --> 18:48.711
What do you exactly want?

18:48.920 --> 18:54.217
I want my job back or compensation
I need to live too

18:54.551 --> 18:56.594
Why don't you tell that
to the National Intelligence?

18:56.594 --> 18:58.304
Instead of this program?

18:58.304 --> 19:01.224
They won't let me

19:01.266 --> 19:02.725
Mr. Seo

19:03.476 --> 19:04.561
Yes

19:07.522 --> 19:13.194
What did you do at the National
Intelligence before you got fired?

19:14.529 --> 19:18.116
It's confidential information
I can't tell you

19:20.034 --> 19:20.994
Shoot

19:22.120 --> 19:25.123
His Taekwondo moves
are very collected

19:25.290 --> 19:27.458
And he gets hit
like the collected person he is

19:27.709 --> 19:32.213
If he really was a secret agent,
I'm worried about our national security

19:40.722 --> 19:44.976
A very strong jab in the abdomen
It was a big impact for him

20:01.576 --> 20:04.579
The legendary national intelligence agent
is going down

20:04.871 --> 20:06.080
Give it up

20:06.623 --> 20:09.000
Mr. Seo
Give it up

20:09.167 --> 20:11.461
He is holding up
Mr. Seo

20:11.753 --> 20:13.630
I said to give up

20:13.671 --> 20:15.506
He's still doing okay

20:17.300 --> 20:20.011
Wait
What is that?

20:20.386 --> 20:23.389
Mr. Seo
Where are you going?

20:23.514 --> 20:24.766
Mr. Seo!

20:25.892 --> 20:28.937
Was this show a comedy genre?

20:29.270 --> 20:33.566
I didn't scout you with a big salary
to do comedy

20:33.900 --> 20:36.819
Don't edit any of the National
Intelligence story and just go

20:36.819 --> 20:38.738
The National Intelligence will understand
that we did it for the entertainment

20:38.821 --> 20:41.199
Yes
Let's go to next contestant

20:41.199 --> 20:43.159
You used to make such
highly rated programs on broadcast TV

20:43.159 --> 20:46.746
But now, your show continuously has
only one ratings point at our network

20:46.829 --> 20:50.458
We feel somewhat insulted

20:50.625 --> 20:51.751
Who's next?

20:52.961 --> 20:58.383
Here we have our last contestant
of Legendary Fighter

20:58.716 --> 21:00.176
Name is Lim Deok-kyu

21:00.385 --> 21:03.596
He is 43 years old
and owns a noodle restaurant

21:04.097 --> 21:08.893
He was a legend at Sadang High
and took control of Dongjak district 25 years ago

21:08.977 --> 21:13.731
The charismatic Legendary Fighter
steps into the ring

21:22.740 --> 21:23.783
Fight

21:27.537 --> 21:32.292
Mr. Lim used to be an amateur boxer
up until high school

21:32.542 --> 21:37.005
Mr. Lim was a boxer
not a martial arts athlete

21:43.303 --> 21:44.554
A low kick

21:44.554 --> 21:47.598
Look at that low kick
There's nothing like that in boxing

21:59.610 --> 22:03.948
Mr. Lim seems so lethargic

22:06.534 --> 22:08.703
Referee, tighten it up
The show is getting too loose

22:09.162 --> 22:10.079
Fight

22:11.039 --> 22:13.791
Mr. Jung
Hurry and finish him

22:37.357 --> 22:39.275
What just happened?

22:39.692 --> 22:41.027
Our Jung Sang-ho

22:41.027 --> 22:43.446
the middleweight champion
is down

22:43.571 --> 22:46.783
Jung is okay
He's fine. Go!

23:02.965 --> 23:04.801
A left hook!
A left hook

23:04.801 --> 23:06.135
Right uppercut

23:06.135 --> 23:07.470
Down!

23:07.512 --> 23:09.639
Jung is down again

23:09.639 --> 23:11.307
The contender who came
for a verification of his fighting skills

23:11.307 --> 23:14.310
knocked down our
professional athlete

23:14.435 --> 23:16.896
This is unbelievable

23:16.979 --> 23:19.315
- Is Jung okay?
- Holy shit!

23:20.608 --> 23:22.944
Mr. Jung
Jung Sang-ho!

23:23.444 --> 23:25.321
Jung, get up!

23:37.583 --> 23:40.461
After one hour, we'll tape the show
Are you going to be okay?

23:41.504 --> 23:44.882
I think one hour will be enough

23:49.178 --> 23:49.887
Let me see

23:53.641 --> 23:54.684
I'm okay

23:54.725 --> 23:57.061
I think you got it worse than me

24:03.025 --> 24:06.737
I told you I have conviction about you

24:08.156 --> 24:10.867
Please hold back the pain
and win one more game

24:11.075 --> 24:14.370
For $20,000
and for the TV ratings

24:14.620 --> 24:16.539
I don't care much about the ratings

24:16.539 --> 24:18.583
If I win, can I get the money
right away?

24:18.666 --> 24:21.836
On the spot,
in a white envelope

24:22.795 --> 24:26.382
The contestant won by disqualification

24:27.383 --> 24:31.304
I think Mr. Lim has over 95%
chance of winning

24:31.387 --> 24:33.681
Your show appearance pay
will be transferred to your account

24:33.681 --> 24:35.183
So hurry and go home

24:36.434 --> 24:38.436
That was from two weeks ago

24:38.436 --> 24:41.314
There was a new winner
from last week

24:42.315 --> 24:43.858
Who is that?

24:44.275 --> 24:46.444
The National Intelligence agent
doesn't know?

24:46.527 --> 24:48.905
Do they have to know everything?

24:48.946 --> 24:50.198
What?

24:59.040 --> 25:03.920
For the prize of $20,000
A match between two legends

25:05.087 --> 25:09.425
Mr. Shin Jae-seok knocked out
Mr. Yoon Sung-jin

25:09.425 --> 25:11.260
and won $20,000

25:11.844 --> 25:16.807
Will he win against the unprecedented
Mr. Lim Deok-kyu?

25:18.434 --> 25:22.104
Mr. Shin said he never
played any sports

25:22.104 --> 25:24.732
But as seen last week,
he is animalistic

25:24.732 --> 25:27.610
and has instinctive fighting skills

25:37.370 --> 25:39.455
Here are the instructions

25:39.747 --> 25:40.998
Long time no see

25:41.624 --> 25:43.125
Now you recognize me

25:43.417 --> 25:44.585
Stop talking to each other

25:45.002 --> 25:48.381
No headbutts, soccer kicks,
elbows

25:48.631 --> 25:49.757
Elbow?

25:49.966 --> 25:51.008
Elbow strikes

25:53.553 --> 25:54.762
To your corners

26:10.820 --> 26:13.364
I'm Shin Jae-seok
from South Seoul High

26:43.102 --> 26:45.646
Coming on the show like this
Your life must be pretty shitty

26:45.813 --> 26:47.356
Let's get this over with

26:48.608 --> 26:50.735
I think the two just
talked to each other

26:50.735 --> 26:54.030
It was probably something like
"let's not get hurt"

26:54.071 --> 26:55.948
Shin's attack continues

26:55.948 --> 26:57.825
A takedown!

26:58.075 --> 27:01.871
He's showing superb skills today

27:01.912 --> 27:04.582
Will Lim survive today?

27:05.082 --> 27:09.587
Did Shin learn martial arts?
He looks like a real fighter

27:36.572 --> 27:39.116
Understand
I just need the money

27:41.702 --> 27:44.205
That's not right

27:44.580 --> 27:48.042
Headbutts and elbows, which can
cause injuries, are forbidden

27:48.084 --> 27:50.586
This is not the back alley
Mr. Shin

27:54.090 --> 27:55.424
That's a warning
No headbutts

28:26.455 --> 28:27.415
Cut

28:31.293 --> 28:32.128
Cut

28:33.295 --> 28:35.005
Stop, stop, stop!

28:39.218 --> 28:40.010
Cut

28:40.094 --> 28:41.637
That's a cut
Cut!

28:41.637 --> 28:42.596
What?

28:42.596 --> 28:46.434
We can't have that many tattoos
We can't air this

28:46.892 --> 28:48.519
Why not?

28:48.728 --> 28:50.271
Kids these days love these

28:50.271 --> 28:54.275
Mr. Shin. Do you want to
advertise your gangster days?

28:57.611 --> 29:01.824
That's our money
So you follow my rules

29:04.326 --> 29:07.913
Edit the scene when he takes the shirt off
and go from where they go again

29:09.582 --> 29:11.375
This is how I've been doing

29:12.418 --> 29:13.377
Fight

29:23.345 --> 29:25.639
Lim corners Shin

29:35.024 --> 29:36.525
A ceaseless stream of punches

29:36.525 --> 29:38.194
This is dangerous for Shin

29:38.194 --> 29:39.069
A left hook

29:39.069 --> 29:41.155
A right hook
A left hook. A right hook

29:41.155 --> 29:43.073
Continuing left hooks

29:43.073 --> 29:44.074
Stop

29:44.074 --> 29:47.119
Referee stops

29:47.203 --> 29:50.247
Referee stops the bout

29:50.539 --> 29:52.792
Lim is the winner

29:52.917 --> 29:54.627
He is awesome

29:54.835 --> 29:56.337
After knocking out
a professional athlete,

29:56.337 --> 29:59.757
he perfectly vanquished
last week's winner, Shin Jae-seok

29:59.965 --> 30:02.885
A new star is born

30:07.223 --> 30:09.725
Shin Jae-seok
You all right?

30:16.982 --> 30:18.692
I didn't go down

30:23.239 --> 30:27.034
We're going to aggressively promote
this week's show

30:27.076 --> 30:30.496
A noodle shop owner
knocks down a professional athlete

30:30.579 --> 30:33.707
You're going to become
an overnight sensation

30:33.874 --> 30:36.710
While we are at it,
why don't we go for the 10th win?

30:36.919 --> 30:38.337
I'm done

30:38.754 --> 30:39.713
Excuse me?

30:39.755 --> 30:41.549
I just need $20,000

30:41.590 --> 30:44.426
A human shouldn't beat up others
and get kicked around for money

30:45.219 --> 30:48.472
I think you habitually
only think about yourself

30:48.597 --> 30:53.352
What about our TV station
who just gave you $20,000?

30:53.435 --> 30:55.020
I'm going to stop here

30:55.104 --> 30:57.690
You can ride this car home

30:58.357 --> 31:00.150
Thanks for everything

31:02.778 --> 31:04.154
Mr. Lim Deok-kyu

31:05.364 --> 31:07.992
Shouldn't you leave the cool stuff for
young ones in their 20s?

31:08.284 --> 31:11.495
40-somethings should do
anything for money

31:11.495 --> 31:12.913
You got family

31:17.126 --> 31:18.544
See you in a few days

31:21.797 --> 31:23.007
Shouldn't you be home already?

31:23.632 --> 31:24.800
You want me to take this cab?

31:24.800 --> 31:26.760
Why don't you call the National
Intelligence chopper?

31:26.969 --> 31:29.013
I told you I got fired

31:29.013 --> 31:30.931
If you want to be on TV so badly,

31:30.931 --> 31:34.977
just go sit on the first row
of televised talent competitions

31:38.731 --> 31:42.318
Please don't edit anything
in my episode

31:42.860 --> 31:45.154
The managerial office of National
Intelligence must see this

31:46.113 --> 31:48.115
That arrogant bitch

31:48.866 --> 31:52.161
How old are you?
My birthday is in January, 1970

31:57.291 --> 31:58.751
How long has it been?

31:59.335 --> 32:00.794
25, 26 years?

32:01.003 --> 32:02.171
It's been a while

32:03.005 --> 32:04.673
How are your parents?

32:05.507 --> 32:08.844
With a son like me?

32:09.678 --> 32:11.013
They are long gone

32:11.096 --> 32:13.849
I'm sorry I couldn't go to the funerals

32:15.142 --> 32:18.062
I didn't go either
I was in the slammer

32:18.479 --> 32:19.897
How are your kids?

32:21.190 --> 32:23.359
I'm a bachelor

32:23.609 --> 32:27.363
Don't I look like a college student?

32:30.074 --> 32:32.368
Life is tough, huh?

32:32.409 --> 32:35.496
Me?
I'm doing all right

32:35.829 --> 32:39.500
This show was for fun
Just wanted to warm up

32:40.167 --> 32:44.088
You still got the punch

32:46.465 --> 32:48.550
My ride is here
Wait

32:51.595 --> 32:56.475
If someone bothers you at work,
you call me

32:57.434 --> 33:00.062
And make a lot of money
at that stupid show

33:02.898 --> 33:04.566
Do you see the guys still?

33:04.817 --> 33:05.901
The guys?

33:06.026 --> 33:07.695
You know, Jin-ho and Sang-hoon

33:08.195 --> 33:10.322
I haven't seen them
ever since then

33:11.115 --> 33:15.077
Really?
Let's grab a drink sometime

33:17.997 --> 33:19.540
<i>Jae-seek</i>

33:20.624 --> 33:24.378
You must had a tough time there
I should've visited you

33:24.670 --> 33:25.921
Where?

33:26.296 --> 33:27.715
The juvenile hall

33:29.091 --> 33:30.759
You mean the prison

33:32.469 --> 33:34.096
Are you sorry?

33:34.304 --> 33:35.431
Yeah

33:35.431 --> 33:38.100
If you were sorry, you should've
let me win

33:41.395 --> 33:42.604
See you

33:54.283 --> 33:56.118
Why did you sit in the back?

33:56.118 --> 33:57.911
I'm not your driver

33:57.911 --> 34:00.456
Sorry
That's my friend

34:00.456 --> 34:02.166
Just let me have this one today

34:02.791 --> 34:03.625
Huh?

34:03.625 --> 34:05.044
What's with your face?

34:05.044 --> 34:06.420
Did you lose today?

34:07.463 --> 34:10.299
I'll tell you later
Hurry and go

34:11.425 --> 34:13.302
You call yourself a gangster

34:13.302 --> 34:17.139
You're a disgrace to gangsters
Oh, my head

34:20.350 --> 34:21.476
See you

34:39.244 --> 34:41.538
One, two
Faster

34:42.246 --> 34:44.333
One, two, three
One, two, three

34:44.500 --> 34:46.752
You're late
One, two

34:48.837 --> 34:50.672
Wake up
Huh?

34:51.507 --> 34:52.757
One touch

34:52.966 --> 34:54.217
Faster

34:54.885 --> 34:56.804
Why do we box?

34:57.638 --> 34:59.014
To enhance the national prestige?

34:59.264 --> 35:00.599
My ass

35:01.350 --> 35:03.060
We box because we want to get rich

35:04.186 --> 35:07.856
For poor people like you
who don't study, the only way to get rich is

35:08.148 --> 35:12.653
getting a medal that pays pension
or becoming a boxing champion

35:12.903 --> 35:14.363
So work hard

35:14.571 --> 35:15.572
Yes, coach

35:15.572 --> 35:18.700
Until the Olympics in 1988,
let's work hard for one year

35:19.535 --> 35:20.744
Got it?

35:20.869 --> 35:22.121
Yes

35:23.497 --> 35:25.541
- Dismissed
- Thank you, coach

35:27.084 --> 35:28.252
You kids

35:55.487 --> 35:56.572
Lim Deok-kyu!

35:59.908 --> 36:00.826
Deok-kyu!

36:00.909 --> 36:02.244
What the fuck?

36:04.079 --> 36:07.124
I'm a junior here
We're in the same class

36:07.624 --> 36:08.500
Sadang?

36:08.584 --> 36:09.710
Yeah

36:13.547 --> 36:15.424
Don't hurt an innocent by-stander

36:15.424 --> 36:17.301
We only want to kick your ass

36:27.811 --> 36:29.104
Guys

36:31.773 --> 36:33.066
Just stop

36:37.487 --> 36:40.866
Sadang High kids
Just go

36:43.785 --> 36:45.454
Aren't you cocky?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.044
Sadang High bastards
are just hopeless

36:55.964 --> 36:57.299
I told you to go

36:58.508 --> 36:59.635
Let's go

37:00.177 --> 37:01.220
Fuck

37:03.347 --> 37:04.806
Asshole

37:07.100 --> 37:08.435
Fucker

37:19.446 --> 37:20.739
I'm sorry

37:21.198 --> 37:23.158
I'm Lim Deok-kyu from
Sadang High

37:23.825 --> 37:25.994
I'm an athlete
so I can't get in trouble

37:27.996 --> 37:29.206
See you later

37:30.582 --> 37:31.792
You stop right there

37:36.380 --> 37:38.423
Study hard guys

37:38.715 --> 37:40.008
We have to go to college

37:40.467 --> 37:42.219
Hey, 88 Olympics

37:43.095 --> 37:44.429
88 Olympics!

37:49.643 --> 37:52.104
When do you have time to sleep?
You have to work out

37:54.690 --> 37:56.108
Who are you GUYS?

37:56.358 --> 37:59.194
I heard that you manhandled
South Seoul High kids yesterday

38:00.612 --> 38:02.364
All right
Just go away

38:02.698 --> 38:04.199
I won't cause
any problems at school

38:04.199 --> 38:06.034
That's not why I came

38:07.202 --> 38:11.248
After you moved here,
you should've come to us first

38:15.585 --> 38:17.212
Are you the leader here?

38:24.594 --> 38:26.179
He's number one

38:26.638 --> 38:28.056
You're number two

38:28.598 --> 38:29.725
Got it

38:30.225 --> 38:31.435
Dude

38:31.685 --> 38:34.563
We want to be friends with
the national representative

38:34.896 --> 38:35.731
Okay?

38:36.023 --> 38:37.566
What asshole?

38:40.235 --> 38:41.695
Shall we step out?

38:43.905 --> 38:47.576
Leave me in peace
You assholes

38:53.665 --> 38:58.420
You have an awesome voice,
but you've got a bad attitude

39:00.756 --> 39:02.174
Were you in an oratorical contest?

39:03.884 --> 39:06.803
I, Lim...

39:07.512 --> 39:10.599
Lim...
Yo, what's his name?

39:11.433 --> 39:13.268
Lim Deok-kyu

39:13.602 --> 39:17.147
Lim Deok-kyu
Come out, bitch!

39:17.397 --> 39:19.024
Lim Deok-kyu

39:20.108 --> 39:23.236
Lim Deok-kyu
Come out, bitch

39:23.362 --> 39:24.279
Who are you?

39:24.321 --> 39:25.822
What the fuck?

39:26.365 --> 39:29.117
- Mr. Park. Call the dean. Hurry
- Lim Deok-kyu

39:29.618 --> 39:32.287
- Get lost
- What the fuck

39:32.662 --> 39:34.373
- Are you crazy?
- Who are you?

39:34.373 --> 39:37.000
Get out of my fucking way

39:38.877 --> 39:40.504
Lim Deok-kyu

39:42.130 --> 39:44.299
Where are you?
Lim Deok-kyu

39:58.688 --> 39:59.940
You know him?

40:00.273 --> 40:01.733
You want to do it here?

40:02.192 --> 40:03.985
Or go some place quiet?

40:06.405 --> 40:07.656
Let's go

40:10.450 --> 40:11.743
HEY. Olympics

40:14.079 --> 40:15.497
Where are you from?

40:15.705 --> 40:18.333
I'm Shin Jae-seok from
South Seoul High. Asshole

40:18.875 --> 40:21.336
Why did you come to our school
without a permission?

40:41.523 --> 40:42.941
That was a pretty good punch

40:43.024 --> 40:44.568
I'm not here to see you

40:47.696 --> 40:48.447
Where are you going?

40:48.447 --> 40:49.322
I'm running away

40:49.322 --> 40:51.616
Bitch
Stop right there

40:53.577 --> 40:58.498
You can stop
I'm not here to see you

41:03.420 --> 41:05.255
- Hope it's delicious
- Yes. Hope you like it

41:05.547 --> 41:07.174
- Us this a bribe?
- Yes, it is

41:07.174 --> 41:07.757
okay

41:07.757 --> 41:08.925
- Thanks
- Please enjoy it

41:08.925 --> 41:10.135

41:10.719 --> 41:11.553
<i>HEY</i>

41:11.636 --> 41:13.388
You guys get down from there

41:13.388 --> 41:15.891
All right

41:16.266 --> 41:18.727
Just leave them alone

41:21.938 --> 41:23.064
Are you hungry?

41:23.231 --> 41:26.651
You told me not to pack lunch
and what do I get in return?

41:26.735 --> 41:28.403
Just wait

41:28.904 --> 41:32.199
My old man gave me some money
for the field trip

41:36.411 --> 41:37.704
What do you want to do after?

41:37.996 --> 41:40.499
It'll be over by 3 PM
What else is there to do?

41:40.749 --> 41:42.375
Let's just watch a movie
and grab a beer

41:42.375 --> 41:43.585
I have something better

41:45.462 --> 41:48.048
Why don't you two fight?

41:48.256 --> 41:49.591
We'll gather kids around

41:49.716 --> 41:52.010
Whoever wins,
I'll give you the money

41:52.260 --> 41:53.261
How about it?

41:53.637 --> 41:55.263
Do you think I'm stupid?

41:55.347 --> 41:58.808
I just want to bet on a fair
sporting event

41:58.808 --> 42:01.269
Son Jin-ho
You must be an imbecile

42:01.311 --> 42:03.271
Your dad is the imbecile

42:04.105 --> 42:06.107
- What asshole?
- Forget it

42:06.358 --> 42:07.984
Don't do it if you don't want to

42:07.984 --> 42:09.486
It's for $200

42:12.489 --> 42:15.325
You pussies have no ambition

42:17.536 --> 42:19.663
He's so freaking late

42:27.295 --> 42:29.631
- What took you so long?
- I'm sorry, sir

42:29.631 --> 42:32.384
What's with that?
Is he rich or something?

42:32.926 --> 42:34.386
You know Chung-myung Group?

42:35.011 --> 42:36.137
Yeah

42:36.179 --> 42:38.098
His grandfather is the founder

42:39.015 --> 42:41.142
His father is the president
of Chung-myung Construction

42:41.393 --> 42:42.811
Really?

42:44.980 --> 42:47.566
Is that why you always
keep your mouth shut in front of him?

42:54.030 --> 42:54.948
Drink up

42:55.115 --> 42:56.616
To 88 Olympics,

42:56.616 --> 42:58.076
let's not offer alcohol
or cigarettes

42:58.326 --> 43:00.370
That's right

43:04.916 --> 43:06.293
Get a gold medal

43:15.218 --> 43:16.553
What is that?

43:22.183 --> 43:24.102
That persevering bastard

43:24.519 --> 43:26.521
He must've seen A Better Tomorrow
too many times

43:26.855 --> 43:28.356
He thinks he's Chow Yun Fat

43:32.944 --> 43:34.613
You want me to go again?

43:35.071 --> 43:37.365
I have to make it to the Olympics

43:37.699 --> 43:39.451
Then don't go to the Olympics

43:49.586 --> 43:50.754
Lee Sang-hoon

43:53.715 --> 43:55.133
He's calling for you

43:56.176 --> 43:57.427
Lim Deok-kyu

43:58.720 --> 44:00.180
You two losers come out

44:03.266 --> 44:04.934
Lee Sang-hoon
Lim Deok-kyu

44:05.852 --> 44:07.729
I'm eating, asshole

44:07.812 --> 44:09.689
I haven't had lunch either

44:12.400 --> 44:14.361
He's got good punches

44:18.907 --> 44:20.116
Hit me with it

44:25.413 --> 44:26.998
Hurry and do it

44:27.666 --> 44:29.250
This isn't right

44:30.377 --> 44:31.795
I want a duel

44:34.005 --> 44:35.465
You can't do it?

44:36.257 --> 44:38.385
Then punch me one time
and get it over with

44:45.892 --> 44:46.810
Satisfied?

44:50.313 --> 44:51.815
You hit me twice

44:52.857 --> 44:56.444
Last blow to the stomach is embarrassing
so I won't say anything

44:59.489 --> 45:00.198
Cheers

45:00.281 --> 45:01.825
- Cheers
- Cheers

45:03.827 --> 45:06.371
Now that we're friends,
it's friends till the end

45:06.663 --> 45:08.415
Did you see Chow Yun Fat
and Lung Ti?

45:08.456 --> 45:09.624
Loyalty!

45:12.544 --> 45:14.546
One more time, Cheers!

45:14.838 --> 45:15.839
Cheers

45:31.604 --> 45:35.984
Thank you so much for
the wonderful food and drinks

45:36.109 --> 45:37.444
It's my pleasure

45:37.444 --> 45:38.987
Did you think I'd say that?

45:41.322 --> 45:44.367
Lobbying with food
is the lowest kind

45:46.995 --> 45:50.665
I won't touch the food
Let's just drink

46:09.350 --> 46:12.353
The second generation
of rich family business owners never does

46:12.937 --> 46:17.942
But the third generation is always
getting in trouble, drinking alcohol

46:20.028 --> 46:23.114
Maybe because they mix their drinks

46:23.990 --> 46:25.283
<i>By 'the Way</i>

46:25.658 --> 46:27.952
Who tipped off reporter Seo
about the incident?

46:28.620 --> 46:31.122
It must've been
one of the employees there

46:31.372 --> 46:32.624
The informer?

46:38.254 --> 46:39.714
I'll tell you after you drink this

46:48.097 --> 46:49.974
Is the informer important?

46:51.476 --> 46:54.729
It's important that the readers
love these gossips

46:55.188 --> 46:56.940
Stories of the rich and famous

46:58.650 --> 47:06.574
It's important to us that you hold back
that piece forever

47:06.825 --> 47:10.245
As soon as I go to my office,
I'm going to print it for tomorrow's paper

47:10.453 --> 47:14.374
Please, sir. I beg you
Just follow the custom

47:17.252 --> 47:18.753
What custom?

47:19.462 --> 47:21.214
You want to withdraw
the advertisements?

47:23.967 --> 47:25.426
Please understand

47:25.635 --> 47:29.764
That's the only thing we can do

47:39.274 --> 47:44.654
I heard that you and Mr. Son
are best friends

47:45.530 --> 47:46.739
We are classmates

47:53.121 --> 47:54.372
Have a drink

47:58.918 --> 48:01.546
Birds of a feather truly
do flock together

48:02.130 --> 48:04.841
One beats up a bar hostess

48:05.758 --> 48:10.096
One threatens a chief editor
that he's going to withdraw advertisements

48:12.807 --> 48:15.476
You two must be great friends

48:55.516 --> 48:56.684
Are you okay?

49:35.723 --> 49:37.892
<i>Once a high school boxing star,

and it's a big hit

50:05.086 --> 50:07.422
Someone from the audience

- I'll be right there to clean up

50:35.783 --> 50:40.413

Don't come to work anymore
You might get sick

50:43.291 --> 50:45.668
I don't know how to beat up someone

50:45.668 --> 50:47.587
but I got better stamina than you

50:47.587 --> 50:51.007
Don't worry about others
and go work out

50:51.090 --> 50:54.635
I don't need to work out
I'm not going back to the show

50:57.430 --> 51:00.808
What? You're not going
for the second and third win?

51:00.850 --> 51:03.478
I got the money I need

51:03.686 --> 51:05.646
Are you insane?

51:06.856 --> 51:09.233
It's a great opportunity

51:09.317 --> 51:11.069
Do you think you're rich?

51:11.194 --> 51:12.403
What's wrong, mom?

51:12.403 --> 51:15.948
Bring him to his senses
Pour a cold bucket of water over him

51:15.990 --> 51:17.116
Why?

52:06.707 --> 52:11.254
Is Mr. so-called Intelligence agent
Seo Kang-kuk Mr. Lim's manager?

52:11.337 --> 52:13.172
The world has become
a better place

52:13.339 --> 52:17.218
If you mentioned Intelligence Service
in the old days, they would've locked you up

52:20.346 --> 52:22.223
Perfect counterpunch

52:22.265 --> 52:23.766
Four, five, six

52:23.766 --> 52:27.186
He won't stop punching
Min is in danger

52:28.729 --> 52:31.399
He's down
This is Lim's chance

52:31.899 --> 52:34.735
But he just stands there

52:34.777 --> 52:36.028
Mr. Lim

52:36.154 --> 52:37.405
- In mixed martial arts,
- Fight

52:37.405 --> 52:39.490
You don't wait when your
opponent goes down

52:39.574 --> 52:42.118
The bout continues until
referee stops

52:42.118 --> 52:42.952
Fight

52:43.035 --> 52:45.663
This action is ridiculing
the opponent even more

52:45.663 --> 52:46.664
Fight

52:49.750 --> 52:51.794
A strong right body punch

52:53.462 --> 52:55.381
Referee stops

52:55.756 --> 53:00.011
He wins second week in a row
Mr. Lim receives $40,000

53:00.011 --> 53:00.678
Winner

53:00.887 --> 53:04.432
I don't know if we'll find
a worthy opponent for Mr. Lim soon

53:04.432 --> 53:06.601
Unless a professional athlete
like our Jason here

53:06.601 --> 53:08.895
How dare you compare him to me?

53:09.270 --> 53:12.148
You need to refrain from insulting
professional martial arts athletes

53:12.231 --> 53:13.566
I think you need to be quiet

53:13.941 --> 53:16.652
Mr. Lim has good manners

53:16.736 --> 53:21.199
Tonight, the owner of Soo-bin's Noodle House
continues to turn his life around

53:26.329 --> 53:27.538
Lim Soo-bin

53:38.966 --> 53:40.885
<i>HEY</i>

53:50.978 --> 53:54.232
You have friends who have
something like this?

53:54.440 --> 53:55.775
Like everybody

53:56.734 --> 53:57.985
Really?

54:01.781 --> 54:03.074
Soo-bin

54:04.200 --> 54:07.828
No matter what,
don't give up on your dreams

54:08.412 --> 54:10.248
You'll regret it later like daddy

54:11.082 --> 54:13.834
Can you not talk something stupid
when we're eating food?

54:14.168 --> 54:15.670
This is not just food
It's pork cutlet

54:17.672 --> 54:18.839
Is this funny?

54:19.799 --> 54:21.175
It's not

54:24.011 --> 54:28.266
That Eun-seo kid
Is she back in school?

54:30.476 --> 54:32.270
That was a good experience for you

54:32.353 --> 54:35.147
So next time, don't beat up
anyone for no reason

54:35.564 --> 54:39.026
When you get mad,
take a deep breath

54:39.568 --> 54:41.988
If you still can't calm down

54:41.988 --> 54:44.031
Then hit some place
like the cheeks

54:44.031 --> 54:46.409
Not the eyes or nose
but spots like cheeks

54:46.409 --> 54:49.912
One, two!
Just punch hard once and end it

54:50.413 --> 54:53.416
You said you won't go back
to that lousy show again

54:53.833 --> 54:57.253
Your grandmother keeps
insisting that I go

54:57.545 --> 55:00.423
and the restaurant is swarming
with customers

55:00.506 --> 55:03.217
If I want to keep that up,
I need to do some advertising

55:03.217 --> 55:04.260
It is him

55:04.260 --> 55:06.512
- Then change the name of the restaurant
- He looks just like him

55:06.512 --> 55:08.389
Stop using my name

55:08.639 --> 55:10.057
Check out his fists

55:10.057 --> 55:11.100
He looks scary

55:11.100 --> 55:13.936
- If he hits us, we might die
- Isn't that the picture girl?

55:14.061 --> 55:15.688
It's her

55:16.272 --> 55:17.356
What's with that?

55:17.356 --> 55:18.357
Let's go

55:18.524 --> 55:19.608
okay

55:28.200 --> 55:31.954
I don't know if getting famous
is such a good idea

55:36.125 --> 55:38.085
I heard that there is a camera in there

55:38.419 --> 55:40.338
Want to take a picture together?

55:40.588 --> 55:42.006
No

55:46.677 --> 55:48.679
You said you have a daughter
in middle school

55:48.888 --> 55:49.930
Yes

55:51.098 --> 55:52.475
Does she like you?

55:53.184 --> 55:54.727
Of course

55:55.269 --> 55:57.396
When you live
abroad for a long time,

55:57.396 --> 55:59.940
a family becomes very tight

56:01.150 --> 56:04.195
Saying that you lived abroad
makes you look like a real agent

56:05.279 --> 56:06.947
I don't lie

56:15.164 --> 56:16.874
Lose him
What are you doing?

56:17.041 --> 56:19.585
Defense
Don't just get hit

56:19.627 --> 56:22.171
Move away and punch

56:25.007 --> 56:27.676
Put your guard up
Put it up

56:31.389 --> 56:34.350
Lim meets a very strong contender
in three weeks

56:34.350 --> 56:38.145
Mr. Kim Sang-rok has learned
martial arts from long ago

56:39.438 --> 56:42.483
As I said, the best martial arts
is the mixed martial arts

56:46.153 --> 56:50.616
Lim is still putting up
a pretty good defense

56:50.991 --> 56:52.326
<i>He's up again</i>

56:54.161 --> 56:56.664
<i>Kim's attack continues</i>

56:56.831 --> 56:58.833
<i>Lim seems helpless</i>

57:00.334 --> 57:02.503
A high kick!
Right on the spot

57:02.628 --> 57:04.422
Lim must've taken a big hit

57:04.505 --> 57:06.424
Lim is continuously pushed back

57:09.677 --> 57:12.346
Does Lim grab this chance?

57:18.310 --> 57:19.687
<i>Continuous blows</i>

57:29.738 --> 57:30.781
A left hook

57:31.198 --> 57:32.533
Left
Right

57:34.118 --> 57:37.079
Now, Lim doesn't wait
on his opponent

57:37.079 --> 57:38.038
Look at that

57:38.205 --> 57:41.584
Massive pounding
That's what I call mixed martial arts

57:41.709 --> 57:45.129
Before he knew it, Lim has
assimilated mixed martial arts

57:45.129 --> 57:46.922
Referee stops

57:47.047 --> 57:49.008
<i>Lim is the winner</i>

57:49.008 --> 57:51.886
<i>Lim has shown us
some shocking stuff</i>

58:00.394 --> 58:02.521
Without consoling his opponent,

58:02.521 --> 58:05.399
Lim enjoys the joy of victory

58:05.566 --> 58:08.777
He becomes a true fighter

58:15.201 --> 58:16.327
- Welcome
- Yes

58:16.327 --> 58:19.121
If you already paid you due,
I guess I can't do anything about it

58:20.456 --> 58:21.415
Lim Deok-kyu

58:21.499 --> 58:22.333
It's Deok-kyu

58:22.333 --> 58:23.334
Hey, Deok-kyu

58:23.584 --> 58:25.961
Welcome

58:26.837 --> 58:28.339
Long time no see

58:28.339 --> 58:31.300
I saw you on TV
You kick ass

58:31.383 --> 58:34.803
He showed that middle-aged
Korean men are still alive

58:34.803 --> 58:37.431
That we are still very much alive

58:37.598 --> 58:43.020
A pride of Class of 88
Legendary Fighter, Lim Deok-kyu

58:47.191 --> 58:48.609
Say something

58:49.318 --> 58:52.905
I thought it'll be awkward to come
to the reunion since this is my first time

58:52.905 --> 58:55.449
But thank you for greeting me
so warmly

58:55.449 --> 58:57.159
Take it easy

58:57.159 --> 58:58.494
We won't hit you

59:00.829 --> 59:03.958
Okay. Hope we keep it touch
more often

59:03.958 --> 59:05.501
I'll come to the reunions more often

59:05.709 --> 59:08.295
So come and dine
at my restaurant

59:08.295 --> 59:10.256
I heard that Soo-bin's Noodle House
is doing really good

59:10.297 --> 59:11.882
What are you going to do
with your prize money?

59:11.882 --> 59:13.175
Pay for this reunion today

59:13.217 --> 59:14.802
Okay
Today, it's on me

59:14.885 --> 59:16.303
Bravo

59:18.305 --> 59:19.640
Go Sadang High

59:19.640 --> 59:21.225
Go!

59:22.893 --> 59:24.812
How have you been?

59:24.979 --> 59:27.147
It sucks

59:27.147 --> 59:28.941
Doesn't everybody?

59:29.275 --> 59:30.568
Wait

59:30.651 --> 59:33.737
Today, why don't we
listen to Deok-kyu's story?

59:33.737 --> 59:37.575
The story of the Legendary Fighter

59:37.616 --> 59:39.952
- That sounds good. Let's hear it
- Great

59:45.332 --> 59:50.129
In senior year, a few kids from our school
got beat up by Myeon-seok High kids

59:50.337 --> 59:52.089
Are they here today?
The ones who got beat up?

59:52.464 --> 59:54.508
- Who is it?
- That's him right there

59:56.010 --> 59:59.096
I took revenge on them
and kicked few butts

59:59.179 --> 01:00:03.225
They chased me for months
It was really tough

01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:06.604
Boxers work out tremendously

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:09.189
They are different from
normal people

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:13.736
They didn't know so they just
came at me

01:00:14.862 --> 01:00:18.741
It's like a kindergartner
picking a fight with a grad school student

01:00:18.991 --> 01:00:24.330
If you were so different,
why did you kick around the normal kids?

01:00:25.873 --> 01:00:29.501
I didn't hit anyone
We were just fooling around

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:33.297
Human memory is so convenient
Isn't it?

01:00:35.883 --> 01:00:38.552
Yo, everybody fooled
around back then

01:00:38.594 --> 01:00:41.722
Hey, Deok-kyu
Why did you quit boxing?

01:00:42.056 --> 01:00:47.186
At first, I was into boxing without
knowing much about it and competed

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:52.024
When everybody kept complimenting me,
I lost interest

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:54.902
I thought you got in trouble
hanging out with Lee Sang-hoon

01:00:54.902 --> 01:00:56.570
and had to quit boxing

01:00:58.906 --> 01:01:00.532
Who said that?

01:01:00.783 --> 01:01:04.578
I heard Sang-hoon works for
Son Jin-ho's CM Group

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:08.624
I guess he wants to spend
his life as a henchman

01:01:09.041 --> 01:01:10.668
That's so sad

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:14.380
You don't see Sang-hoon?

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:17.091
No

01:01:17.091 --> 01:01:19.134
Why not?
You should

01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:22.596
You were best friends with Sang-hoon

01:01:23.806 --> 01:01:25.391
Have a drink

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:28.686
You don't recognize me?

01:01:29.645 --> 01:01:33.399
South Seoul High kids were
kicking my ass

01:01:33.399 --> 01:01:37.569
when you came and saved me
It's me Jang Joon-soo

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:40.030
Oh, Joon-soo

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:43.409
- Nice to see you
- Same here

01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:45.411
- How are you?
- I'm doing great

01:01:45.411 --> 01:01:48.038
I didn't expect to see you here

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:54.294
How did you even think about
coming to the reunion?

01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:56.463
Huh?

01:01:56.964 --> 01:01:59.383
Now that you're here

01:02:00.592 --> 01:02:06.432
I've been meaning to
tell you something

01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:19.403
The time you saved me
I'm not grateful at all

01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:20.988
Why?

01:02:21.447 --> 01:02:26.076
Because after you learned my face,
you were very mean to me

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.748
I didn't use profanity back then
so I didn't know, but now I think about it

01:02:32.833 --> 01:02:34.918
You were a piece of trash

01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:37.045
Hey, Joon-soo
Are you drunk?

01:02:41.842 --> 01:02:45.512
What are you talking about?

01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:46.680
This was all in the past
We're all friends

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.851
A friend?
What friend?

01:02:56.899 --> 01:02:58.776
Let's not do this

01:02:58.776 --> 01:03:00.110
We need another round

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:05.783
Are you leaving?

01:03:05.866 --> 01:03:07.659
No, I'm just paying right now

01:03:07.743 --> 01:03:09.703
- Thank you
- Yes

01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:13.499
- Cheers
- Cheers

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:16.543
This is bull shit

01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:18.545
He's not a legend

01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:21.048
He's an outcast
An outcast

01:03:21.215 --> 01:03:24.176
We just ignored those fist fighting
bastards

01:03:24.176 --> 01:03:27.054
Better alone than in bad company

01:03:27.054 --> 01:03:30.390
Stop it guys. If you start talking
about the past, there is no end to this

01:03:36.355 --> 01:03:39.024
Block it
Mark it

01:03:40.234 --> 01:03:41.485
Nice shot

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.031
Shorter, shorter
Shoot

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:47.157
<i>HEY</i>

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:15.352
- Let's go play by ourselves
- Okay

01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:33.787
You only need to punch
Why are you always running?

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:35.205
Are you going to run a marathon?

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:37.332
Go to your own school

01:04:45.424 --> 01:04:46.675
You better get over here

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:51.847
This is all you got. Right?

01:04:53.015 --> 01:04:56.059
If I find another cent,
you're dead

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:57.352
Lee Sang-hoon

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:02.524
Go away

01:05:10.032 --> 01:05:13.327
Just walk away
This is embarrassing

01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:15.829
Is this what number one does?

01:05:17.456 --> 01:05:21.084
You stay in the gym
and stop worrying about school stuff

01:05:21.168 --> 01:05:23.003
I thought you were good

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:25.297
How can a tiger survive
on eating grass?

01:05:25.756 --> 01:05:28.008
If I'm going to play,
I need to fatten my wallet

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.218
Then go earn it, asshole

01:05:30.218 --> 01:05:32.137
or ask for allowance
from Son Jin-ho

01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:33.513
- What the fuck?
- Fuck!

01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:36.391
What are you doing?

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:42.147
I thought you two were friends
Didn't you watch A Better Tomorrow?

01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:45.359
Chow Yun Fat never fights Lung Ti

01:05:46.026 --> 01:05:47.903
You disloyal bastards

01:05:48.946 --> 01:05:50.989
Nothing happened between you two
Got it?

01:06:02.668 --> 01:06:03.669
Go away

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:05.045
Nope

01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:08.507
I said go

01:06:08.507 --> 01:06:09.758
I said no

01:06:12.344 --> 01:06:14.554
The Olympics will be held
in Jamsil district

01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:16.598
Why are they taking down
Sadang district?

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:19.810
What do you want?

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:24.815
Do you think I hang out with Jin-ho
for his money?

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:28.402
Did you come to argue about that?

01:06:29.403 --> 01:06:30.946
On the field trip day

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:35.742
Do you remember the guy
who brought Jin-ho's lunch?

01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:39.121
That's my dad

01:06:41.623 --> 01:06:43.834
He's Jin-ho's mom's driver

01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:49.715
I'm being nice to Jin-ho for
my old man so don't take it wrong

01:06:52.884 --> 01:06:57.305
I'm not a coward who will
brown-nose for money

01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:08.066
The people here are getting kicked out
of their or your beloved Olympics

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:09.484
So what?

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:14.573
So be sorry, qualify for the game,
and get that gold medal

01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:17.951
What does this have to do with me?

01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:19.953
Everything

01:07:21.079 --> 01:07:22.247
Huh?

01:07:22.456 --> 01:07:23.540
What?

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:24.541
What?

01:07:31.006 --> 01:07:34.968
<i>National Amateur Boxing Championship
and 88 Olympics 2nd Qualifying Round</i>

01:07:42.809 --> 01:07:44.811
That's it. One, two
One, two. Okay

01:07:49.316 --> 01:07:50.484
More. Go further in

01:07:52.152 --> 01:07:53.070
That's good!

01:07:58.658 --> 01:07:59.618
Good

01:07:59.618 --> 01:08:00.619
Push him back

01:08:01.828 --> 01:08:02.996
That's good!

01:08:13.757 --> 01:08:14.758
What?

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:38.365
Stop

01:08:56.966 --> 01:09:01.179
We'll announce the judges' decision

01:09:01.555 --> 01:09:06.100
For the 40th National Amateur
Boxing Championship

01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:09.020
and 2nd Qualifying Round for the
national boxing representative

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.106
Final round for welterweight division

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:17.737
With the score of 11 to 10
Red corner, Hwang Yoon-chul wins

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:21.073
- What happened?
- Why?

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:26.078
This game is rigged

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:27.872
Hey, did we win?

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:37.090
Lim Deok-kyu!
Lim Deok-kyu!

01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:42.304
Coach Choi

01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:45.682
What is this?
This is nonsense

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.184
Coach Choi
Let's talk

01:09:47.184 --> 01:09:47.975
Let go of me

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:51.563
For a big game like the Olympics,
an experienced athlete should compete

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:53.607
Isn't that how the world works?

01:09:53.899 --> 01:09:55.275
What?

01:09:56.610 --> 01:10:00.697
Open the fucking scoring card

01:10:01.448 --> 01:10:03.783
You call yourselves judges?

01:10:17.214 --> 01:10:19.132
Lim Deok-kyu won

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:20.800
Lim Deok-kyu

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:25.805
Lim Deok-kyu!
Lim Deok-kyu!

01:10:42.781 --> 01:10:43.698
That's good

01:10:43.782 --> 01:10:45.325
Isn't it?

01:10:46.952 --> 01:10:47.994
Hey, Deok-kyu

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.163
Lim Deok-kyu!

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:50.956
Who is he?

01:10:50.956 --> 01:10:52.040
Don't you know the amateur boxer?

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.917
- He's fine
- Oh yeah?

01:10:53.917 --> 01:10:54.918
Hey, where are you going?

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:57.128
Come and join us

01:10:58.838 --> 01:10:59.798
Deok-kyu?

01:11:01.549 --> 01:11:02.676
Lim Deok-kyu?

01:11:04.261 --> 01:11:05.595
Am I your friend?

01:11:06.137 --> 01:11:07.347
Shit

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:09.975
Just leave him

01:11:11.142 --> 01:11:12.102
You be careful

01:11:12.102 --> 01:11:13.228
okay

01:11:13.353 --> 01:11:14.187
Okay?

01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:15.355
Okay

01:11:25.073 --> 01:11:26.408
Nice clothes

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.955
Look at these ladies

01:11:32.539 --> 01:11:34.124
Let's have fun tonight

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:37.460
Buddy, laugh a little

01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:42.257
Look at these bastards

01:11:42.257 --> 01:11:43.883
- Hello
- Yo, yo

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:45.552
- Where are you going?
- Go down

01:11:45.552 --> 01:11:47.053
Come on
Let us in

01:11:47.053 --> 01:11:49.389
We got money
We'll tip you

01:11:49.514 --> 01:11:53.727
Bastards
Go to Cheongryangri

01:11:53.727 --> 01:11:55.061
Don't come around here

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:58.690
Come on
We won't come back tomorrow

01:11:58.690 --> 01:11:59.941
Yo, bastard

01:12:00.025 --> 01:12:02.402
You want to go in that badly?

01:12:02.944 --> 01:12:04.738
Then go bring your mom

01:12:04.863 --> 01:12:08.074
When I'm done with her,
I'll let you in

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:09.743
What the fuck?

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:11.995
Bitch

01:12:12.162 --> 01:12:14.414
- What the fuck did you say?
- Fucker

01:12:14.414 --> 01:12:15.790
- Just leave him
- What the...?

01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:17.250
Fucker

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:22.339
What, bitch?

01:12:24.466 --> 01:12:25.508
Stop

01:12:26.134 --> 01:12:28.928
Let go of me
What the fuck did you say?

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.430
Stop it

01:12:30.764 --> 01:12:32.098
For Lim Deok-kyu!

01:12:32.307 --> 01:12:33.475
Cheers

01:12:38.646 --> 01:12:40.273
- Where are they?
- Which ones are they?

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:41.316
Hey GUYS

01:12:41.316 --> 01:12:42.484
Fuckers
Get them

01:12:44.319 --> 01:12:45.278
Fuck

01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:11.471
Sang-hoon!

01:13:12.305 --> 01:13:13.390
Shit

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.766
Bitch!

01:13:37.414 --> 01:13:39.290
Hurry and drink up
Let's open for the day

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:40.333
Yes, sir

01:13:40.834 --> 01:13:43.378
Fucking asshole
Get them

01:13:43.378 --> 01:13:44.921
Bitches
You really want to die?

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:46.214
Fucker

01:13:46.214 --> 01:13:47.173
Kill them

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:35.305
Cuff them

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.348
and haul them all in

01:14:42.061 --> 01:14:43.354
Let me fucking go

01:14:43.605 --> 01:14:45.315
Come on!

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:47.567
I'll never lose
Never

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:53.573
I'll never lose

01:14:53.573 --> 01:14:57.202
Bow down to me
You bitches

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:02.624
Mr. Lee, wait

01:15:02.916 --> 01:15:05.084
Lim Deok-kyu is the talk
of the town right now

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:07.086
Can't you just use him
for few more months?

01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:10.882
We've been getting tipped off
about his bad boy days

01:15:10.882 --> 01:15:12.133
So I'm a bit concerned

01:15:12.133 --> 01:15:13.635
What kind of bad stories?

01:15:13.927 --> 01:15:15.803
You were his classmate
Don't you know?

01:15:15.929 --> 01:15:19.057
That he played rough back then?

01:15:19.474 --> 01:15:21.726
Did they say bad things
about me too?

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:24.354
That's only for us to know

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:28.399
Every show needs some
human drama

01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:31.528
Two friends meet in the ringside

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:33.530
One man is a manager
at a big corporation

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.949
who sent his kids abroad
for good education and lives alone

01:15:36.366 --> 01:15:40.537
If you win, we'll make you
the idol of office workers

01:15:42.372 --> 01:15:43.623
Ms. Hong

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:46.459
Do you know how many news media
I'm in charge of?

01:15:46.793 --> 01:15:48.795
If I go on that show, they'll
take me for a joke

01:15:48.795 --> 01:15:50.463
How can I control them afterward?

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:54.801
I'm sorry that you had to come
all the way here

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:57.387
You're in charge of PR

01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:00.306
So you must know your basics?

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:04.310
That our XTM channel is
owned by Minjoo Daily

01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:07.188
I know

01:16:07.188 --> 01:16:09.649
My boss is from Minjoo Daily

01:16:09.649 --> 01:16:12.610
My boss called the chief editor there
this morning

01:16:12.652 --> 01:16:15.363
He said he knows you well

01:16:15.655 --> 01:16:17.490
That you two met recently

01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:37.844
Shit

01:16:47.228 --> 01:16:48.605
I heard you turned it down

01:16:49.314 --> 01:16:50.690
What do you mean?

01:16:50.857 --> 01:16:52.734
Going on the Legendary Fighter show

01:16:56.154 --> 01:16:58.865
I call a direct call from Minjoo Daily

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:03.202
If you go on the show,
they'll make my bar incident go away forever

01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:06.956
Is that show popular?

01:17:09.584 --> 01:17:10.835
Sang-hoon

01:17:11.419 --> 01:17:12.545
Yes

01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:16.215
Just this once

01:17:17.717 --> 01:17:20.678
If you can handle a brief embarrassing
moment, our company can thrive

01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:26.267
We're 43
You're about to take off

01:17:26.267 --> 01:17:28.394
You have to get your promotion

01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:29.979
You'll go, right?

01:17:36.527 --> 01:17:39.614
Shit
There goes my $20 million again

01:17:45.119 --> 01:17:46.412
Answer me

01:17:47.038 --> 01:17:48.164
Okay, sir

01:17:51.918 --> 01:17:56.631
I've always wanted to see you
fight Lim Deok-kyu

01:17:57.048 --> 01:18:00.677
Back in the day, you two almost did
and never actually did

01:18:03.888 --> 01:18:06.349
Can you win against Deok-kyu?

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:14.774
Kang-kuk. Let's go

01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:16.609
Let me drink some water

01:18:17.944 --> 01:18:19.070
Shit

01:18:20.113 --> 01:18:21.197
I'm sorry

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:22.115
Are you okay?

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:25.159
Come out
I'll clean up

01:18:25.535 --> 01:18:27.870
You're going to be late for the taping
Let's clean later

01:18:28.162 --> 01:18:30.206
We can't leave it like this

01:18:30.415 --> 01:18:32.208
I told you to stay out of the kitchen

01:18:33.292 --> 01:18:40.216
Isn't breaking something
a bad omen?

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.219
Thanks for the encouragement

01:18:45.138 --> 01:18:46.639
We're closed today

01:18:48.683 --> 01:18:50.268
We're closed

01:18:52.979 --> 01:18:54.188
Mr. Lim

01:19:06.576 --> 01:19:09.287
Soo-bin
What happened to you?

01:19:09.787 --> 01:19:10.913
Huh?

01:19:11.664 --> 01:19:13.583
What happened?
Tell me

01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:15.585
Soo-bin

01:19:20.673 --> 01:19:25.845
Oh no
Are you okay?

01:19:27.764 --> 01:19:29.098
You'll be okay

01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:30.975
What should I do?

01:19:35.062 --> 01:19:36.397
It's okay

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:40.026
It's okay
It's okay, baby

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:43.196
Soo-bin
Oh no

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:51.037
Soo-bin. Tell us what happened
so we can help you

01:19:51.329 --> 01:19:53.122
Soo-bin. It's okay

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:55.958
Tell us everything
It's okay

01:19:56.417 --> 01:19:59.420
Why can't you talk to us?

01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:02.715
You're just like your mom

01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:11.057
After all that, she came here
To her dad

01:20:18.231 --> 01:20:22.902
What happened?
You're Soo-bin's friend, right?

01:20:23.361 --> 01:20:25.071
Is Soo-bin okay?

01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:32.537
Are you Soo-bin's friend?
I'm Soo-bin's dad

01:20:32.829 --> 01:20:35.081
<i>What happened to Soc-bin?</i>

01:20:35.498 --> 01:20:38.918
I know who did that to Soo-bin

01:20:55.852 --> 01:20:57.520
- Where?
- Over there

01:20:57.645 --> 01:20:58.771
There?

01:21:04.735 --> 01:21:06.487
Move, move, move

01:21:09.115 --> 01:21:13.160
Asshole
Stop acting up

01:21:15.997 --> 01:21:18.249
It's the Legendary Fighter

01:21:34.473 --> 01:21:37.143
You really brought him here

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:40.813
You kick ass
I'll love you forever

01:21:41.022 --> 01:21:44.150
I gave my best acting face

01:21:56.787 --> 01:21:58.706
Who is it?
Who did that to Soo-bin?

01:21:58.831 --> 01:22:00.791
Who is it?
Who did that to Soo-bin?

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:02.668
Hey
Look at his acting face

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:05.212
Look at that face
It's a piece of art

01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:06.714
Did you do it?

01:22:07.006 --> 01:22:08.758
Why would I pick on a girl?

01:22:08.758 --> 01:22:10.718
The girls probably
went at it in school

01:22:11.344 --> 01:22:12.762
Did you do it?

01:22:13.304 --> 01:22:18.935
She's like brittle noodles
There's no fun in punching her

01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:20.394
I know

01:22:21.896 --> 01:22:25.399
One man against many is cowardly

01:22:25.733 --> 01:22:29.111
I know Soo-bin has a temper
and beat up some girls

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:32.865
But how can you do that
to a girl's body?

01:22:34.116 --> 01:22:36.619
What did he just say?

01:22:36.619 --> 01:22:38.955
Lim Soo-bin beating up kids?

01:22:38.996 --> 01:22:40.164
<i>HEY</i>

01:22:40.373 --> 01:22:43.834
She didn't hit anybody
She's an outcast

01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:45.419
The outcast of our class

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:46.754
Is she his real daughter?

01:22:46.963 --> 01:22:48.381
<i>Lim Soc-bin
Loser</i>

01:22:48.381 --> 01:22:50.675
She acts so snooty
because she can draw a little

01:22:50.675 --> 01:22:53.219
That's why she gets beat up
Understand?

01:22:57.223 --> 01:22:59.350
The reason I called you here is

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.061
because I want to fight you

01:23:02.436 --> 01:23:04.897
I'm going to be on the show
after 20 years

01:23:04.897 --> 01:23:06.357
So

01:23:06.816 --> 01:23:08.192
you made her an outcast

01:23:08.192 --> 01:23:10.319
Wasn't that enough?

01:23:10.403 --> 01:23:12.321
Why?

01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:15.866
Be quiet, old man

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:19.912
Listen to me first
I'll start from the beginning

01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:23.249
I'm going to be on the show
in 20 years

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:27.461
I want to be introduced as the
guy who fought you

01:23:27.753 --> 01:23:29.755
Will the show still be on air?

01:23:29.839 --> 01:23:33.092
Hey. He's number one
in the internet fight community

01:23:33.092 --> 01:23:35.594
Fight him
He's pretty good

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:40.725
Stop this. GUYS

01:23:40.933 --> 01:23:42.935
What do you mean?

01:23:43.227 --> 01:23:46.188
A master challenging
another master

01:23:46.188 --> 01:23:48.649
Isn't that a beautiful Asian tradition?

01:23:49.358 --> 01:23:53.362
If you win against me,
I'll make sure that

01:23:53.446 --> 01:23:55.072
no one touches your daughter

01:23:55.448 --> 01:23:57.116
Girls. You promise?

01:23:57.116 --> 01:23:58.451
Yes

01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:08.502
Stop this

01:24:10.463 --> 01:24:13.674
Stop whining and hit me for real

01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:23.476
Is it like father, like daughter?
You two are fucking resilient

01:24:33.694 --> 01:24:35.071
Record it
Hurry

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:40.534
He's good

01:24:47.458 --> 01:24:48.375
Shit

01:24:58.010 --> 01:25:00.012
He's a dead man

01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:22.743
You can't record him
without his manager's permission

01:25:22.952 --> 01:25:25.871
He's the face of Legendary Fighter

01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:28.767
<i>This week's Legendary Fighter is</i>

01:26:32.021 --> 01:26:33.439
<i>Mr. Lee Sang-boon</i>

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:35.941
<i>Congratulations</i>

01:26:36.233 --> 01:26:39.612
<i>He was selected as
this week's Legendary Fighter</i>

01:26:40.571 --> 01:26:43.949
<i>He works as the PR manager
for CM Group</i>

01:26:43.949 --> 01:26:47.411
<i>A successful white-collar
A wonderful family man</i>

01:26:48.162 --> 01:26:52.458
<i>Interesting thing is
Mr. Lim and Mr. Lee</i>

01:26:52.499 --> 01:26:55.794
<i>were classmates at Sadang High</i>

01:26:56.045 --> 01:26:58.631
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
Are you excited?</i>

01:27:16.899 --> 01:27:21.987
Legend of the Legends
Mr. Lim Deok-kyu enters the ring

01:27:24.073 --> 01:27:27.952
The crazed contestant of
Legendary Fighter, Mr. Lim Deok-kyu!

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:33.707
The contender came here to give dreams
to the 10 million white-collars

01:27:33.707 --> 01:27:34.959
Mr. Lee Sang-hoon!

01:27:34.959 --> 01:27:37.711
No headbutts,
soccer kicks, elbows

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:41.548
Lee Sang-hoon
I'm sick of this

01:27:41.674 --> 01:27:43.050
Let's do this fast

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:44.510
Stop talking to each other

01:27:47.513 --> 01:27:49.682
This is a big game

01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:56.730
The classmate match of Legendary Fighter
begins now

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:00.067
Cheer up

01:28:02.236 --> 01:28:03.279
Fight

01:28:12.371 --> 01:28:13.831
Go around
and around

01:28:33.892 --> 01:28:35.728
A middle kick like a bolt of lightning

01:28:35.728 --> 01:28:37.896
- It's okay. Put your guard up
- Lee is incredible

01:28:37.938 --> 01:28:40.733
Lim seems to have taken
a big hit in the abdomen

01:28:40.774 --> 01:28:43.235
He seems impassive today

01:28:43.319 --> 01:28:46.739
Lim doesn't look good today

01:28:47.031 --> 01:28:48.782
He's wobbly when he throws a punch

01:28:48.782 --> 01:28:50.492
He's not defending at all

01:28:50.492 --> 01:28:51.201
Fight

01:28:51.201 --> 01:28:51.952
Put your guard up

01:28:51.952 --> 01:28:54.747
Lee doesn't attack

01:28:54.788 --> 01:28:57.583
Lim Deok-kyu doesn't seem
to have any will to attack either

01:28:57.583 --> 01:28:59.793
You guys can't do this

01:29:03.005 --> 01:29:04.173
Fight

01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:07.384
Take it slow

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:09.219
A front kick!

01:29:14.099 --> 01:29:15.184
<i>HEY</i>

01:29:18.395 --> 01:29:19.938
Another middle kick

01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:21.732
He can't seem to get it together

01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:25.361
Stop

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:29.239
That bout ends in vain

01:29:29.239 --> 01:29:31.116
That was so unexpected

01:29:31.116 --> 01:29:32.618
Lee Sang-hoon
A Knockout win

01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:36.163
Lim Deok-kyu is through

01:29:36.663 --> 01:29:38.457
- Winner
- This is shocking

01:29:38.665 --> 01:29:42.127
Lee Sang-hoon becomes
the new Legendary Fighter

01:29:42.461 --> 01:29:46.298
I think I can hear the 10 million
white-collars cheering for him

01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:48.050
Let go of me

01:30:31.593 --> 01:30:32.886
Soo-bin

01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:38.892
When daddy was young,
he was a boxer

01:30:41.979 --> 01:30:47.359
Then I used those boxing skills
to beat up things

01:30:48.026 --> 01:30:50.237
and take money from people

01:30:51.822 --> 01:30:54.032
I was a piece of trash

01:30:56.201 --> 01:31:00.789
That's why I'm getting punished now

01:31:03.834 --> 01:31:06.462
I've failed to protect you

01:31:07.713 --> 01:31:14.428
It wouldn't make a difference
if I take revenge on those kids now

01:31:19.641 --> 01:31:28.734
I just wanted to be a good dad

01:31:30.611 --> 01:31:31.862
Later...

01:31:33.489 --> 01:31:40.329
when I meet your mom
up there

01:31:44.708 --> 01:31:47.920
I don't want to be ashamed
for failing to protect you

01:31:53.258 --> 01:31:57.596
I'm sorry daddy is a loser

01:31:57.930 --> 01:32:01.058
I'm sorry, Soo-bin
Daddy is a loser

01:32:18.408 --> 01:32:20.202
You're awesome

01:32:32.297 --> 01:32:33.298
Good

01:32:40.013 --> 01:32:42.015
Yes
This is Lee Sang-hoon from PR

01:32:50.607 --> 01:32:52.776
- Hey, you came
- Yes

01:32:59.616 --> 01:33:00.784
Get up

01:33:03.704 --> 01:33:07.708
I told you
I can put up with anything

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.669
except for the labor union
getting in my way

01:33:12.170 --> 01:33:13.964
Bet your position on it

01:33:14.256 --> 01:33:16.592
If you got enough money,
then go sloppy as usual

01:33:16.842 --> 01:33:18.260
I'll bet my life on it

01:33:21.513 --> 01:33:26.393
Give them a pep rally
and fire all those union asses

01:33:26.685 --> 01:33:27.769
Yes, sir

01:33:29.730 --> 01:33:31.023
Go away now

01:33:32.983 --> 01:33:34.192
Give me back the watch

01:33:42.701 --> 01:33:43.785
Good job

01:33:44.995 --> 01:33:46.371
Is Deok-kyu okay?

01:33:50.167 --> 01:33:51.960
That was a direct hit

01:33:52.085 --> 01:33:53.211
I think he's okay

01:33:55.505 --> 01:34:00.802
But Deok-kyu is not the type
to get beat up like that

01:34:01.637 --> 01:34:03.555
There must've been something

01:34:07.726 --> 01:34:10.228
I wanted to see a real bout

01:34:10.896 --> 01:34:12.105
Sang-hoon

01:34:14.566 --> 01:34:17.569
How well do you think
you can fight?

01:34:19.655 --> 01:34:21.657
How different are you
from high school?

01:34:29.456 --> 01:34:30.707
Bring him in

01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:47.099
I want to see your real fighting skills

01:34:47.974 --> 01:34:49.184
If it's good.

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:51.853
I want to sponsor
that Legendary Fighter show

01:34:52.688 --> 01:34:55.232
Thanks to you, we'll get
some good publicity

01:35:01.738 --> 01:35:02.781
Fight

01:35:15.335 --> 01:35:16.461
Sta rt

01:35:20.716 --> 01:35:24.970
You don't think you can win?
Should I not sponsor?

01:35:26.805 --> 01:35:32.436
Mr. Son
Are we 18 years old?

01:35:34.438 --> 01:35:35.856
What?

01:35:37.691 --> 01:35:41.653
Is this something you should ask

01:35:41.653 --> 01:35:44.823
a person who had a fist fight
on TV for the company?

01:35:45.115 --> 01:35:46.450
SQ?

01:35:52.164 --> 01:35:53.665
Jin-ho

01:35:53.999 --> 01:35:56.835
What the fuck did you say?

01:35:56.835 --> 01:35:58.170
Jin-ho?

01:35:58.378 --> 01:35:59.838
Jin-ho!

01:36:08.930 --> 01:36:14.436
Why did you stop
growing up after 18?

01:36:19.357 --> 01:36:23.361
Do you want to get fired?

01:36:24.154 --> 01:36:29.493
It's been too long
Let's end it here

01:36:30.535 --> 01:36:32.204
I'm deeply indebted to you

01:36:36.208 --> 01:36:38.418
<i>Manger Lee
Lee Sang-boon</i>

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:40.253
Lee Sang-hoon!

01:36:40.837 --> 01:36:41.922
Sang-hoon

01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:03.777
Manager Lee
That was a great show

01:37:17.958 --> 01:37:19.626
Okay, Hyun-joon
I got you

01:37:19.626 --> 01:37:21.336
I got you so listen to me

01:37:21.837 --> 01:37:25.507
When you pick a school,
you need to evaluate the quality

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:29.553
such as how many graduates
make it to Harvard or Yale

01:37:30.095 --> 01:37:32.430
Don't you worry about the tuition

01:37:32.889 --> 01:37:34.891
What do I do the best?

01:37:35.892 --> 01:37:38.144
What does daddy do the best?

01:37:40.230 --> 01:37:42.023
I'm best at making money

01:37:42.774 --> 01:37:46.611
Ask mom if there was a time
daddy didn't send money on time

01:37:48.446 --> 01:37:49.906
So don't

01:37:54.786 --> 01:38:01.126
So don't think about anything else
and simply study

01:38:02.127 --> 01:38:04.963
Ask mom for anything
If you need more money, you tell me

01:38:04.963 --> 01:38:06.715
Daddy can send you everything

01:38:07.799 --> 01:38:15.515
You know I make good money
I'm the key person at work

01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:18.393
You know?

01:38:20.228 --> 01:38:22.731
Thanks, son

01:38:23.982 --> 01:38:29.738
Now, you can tell me
what you really wanted to say in English

01:38:42.208 --> 01:38:43.543
What are you doing?

01:38:44.336 --> 01:38:45.795
I'm sitting

01:38:45.837 --> 01:38:47.005
I told you so

01:38:47.005 --> 01:38:51.426
Lee Sang-hoon is not making
enough buzz around the white-collars

01:38:51.635 --> 01:38:52.636
Chief

01:38:52.636 --> 01:38:55.680
I think this lukewarm response
of the viewers

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:56.890
Mr. Cho!

01:39:01.561 --> 01:39:03.188
Match of Legends?

01:39:03.355 --> 01:39:06.358
We ask people to vote online
for the best eight players

01:39:06.358 --> 01:39:09.903
For the prize of $100,000,
an 8 player knock-out tournament

01:39:10.195 --> 01:39:12.822
A contest to find the best
middle-aged fighter

01:39:13.031 --> 01:39:14.407
Isn't it sexy?

01:39:15.992 --> 01:39:17.285
Not for $100,000

01:39:17.410 --> 01:39:18.703
Why not?

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:20.205
It's too little

01:39:20.497 --> 01:39:21.665
Then for $200,000?

01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:24.834
I'll take the $200,000
and raise live broadcast

01:39:24.834 --> 01:39:27.003
When people dial in to vote,
we can also charge them money

01:39:27.545 --> 01:39:28.755
Call

01:39:28.838 --> 01:39:30.465
If I may add one more,

01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:32.384
these untamed fights
no longer draw attention

01:39:32.384 --> 01:39:35.345
So we train them with
an intensive course

01:39:35.345 --> 01:39:40.100
Jason owns a gym
We train all of them there

01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:43.228
so they can fight like
the professional athletes

01:39:43.603 --> 01:39:45.397
Good

01:39:46.022 --> 01:39:50.360
So you didn't get your title
by winning a poker game

01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:52.737
You like my idea?

01:39:53.405 --> 01:39:54.614
Okay

01:39:56.074 --> 01:39:58.451
Legend Team
Let's all gather in the meeting room

01:39:58.451 --> 01:39:59.244
Yes

01:39:59.244 --> 01:40:00.495
Ms. Hong

01:40:00.829 --> 01:40:03.748
Remember the guy who was
bluffing about National Intelligence?

01:40:04.082 --> 01:40:05.083
Mr. Seo Kang-kuk?

01:40:05.125 --> 01:40:06.459
That's him

01:40:06.710 --> 01:40:08.420
He called me

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:10.088
Why?

01:40:10.422 --> 01:40:12.424
I got his old job back

01:40:12.841 --> 01:40:13.925
What?

01:40:13.925 --> 01:40:16.094
He wanted to thank me
for getting what he wants

01:40:16.219 --> 01:40:18.304
and thank the show

01:40:26.146 --> 01:40:27.689

Don't I cook well?

01:41:16.738 --> 01:41:18.114
You're about half as good as mom

01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:21.951
Eat a lot

01:41:22.118 --> 01:41:23.203
You too

01:41:30.376 --> 01:41:32.921
That's your favorite

01:41:33.004 --> 01:41:36.925
I had 7 pieces out of 8
You eat it

01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:41.721
Since my cutie pie gave it to me,
I'll try it

01:41:43.098 --> 01:41:44.307
It's yummy

01:41:53.691 --> 01:41:57.153
Hello
I told you I won't go

01:41:57.153 --> 01:41:58.863
Stop calling me

01:41:59.614 --> 01:42:02.700
You made that tournament
without asking me

01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:04.536
What can I possibly do now?

01:42:04.702 --> 01:42:05.870
Match of Legends?

01:42:05.954 --> 01:42:07.038
Yeah

01:42:09.124 --> 01:42:13.503
There are many guys
who want to show off their strength

01:42:13.503 --> 01:42:16.881
So bring them to the show
I'm not interested

01:42:18.591 --> 01:42:20.218
Are you kidding me?

01:42:21.594 --> 01:42:24.055
You told me never to
give up on a dream

01:42:25.431 --> 01:42:26.975
What dream?

01:42:27.725 --> 01:42:31.062
When you were boxing,
did you ever win a championship?

01:42:32.730 --> 01:42:36.484
No. I haven't

01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:47.078
Lim Soo-bin

01:42:48.454 --> 01:42:55.461
Granny called. She told me
to make you go on the tournament

01:43:20.904 --> 01:43:21.946
Eight

01:43:21.988 --> 01:43:23.323
Kick with your weight into it

01:43:24.866 --> 01:43:27.410
Sang-hoon, harder
It's too weak

01:43:30.496 --> 01:43:31.789
Kick with your weight into it

01:43:32.081 --> 01:43:34.459
That's it
A knee kick

01:43:39.964 --> 01:43:41.257
Hi, Deok-kyu
You came

01:43:45.053 --> 01:43:46.971
One, two
One, two

01:43:47.639 --> 01:43:50.058
Jab into it
Grab it by the neck

01:43:50.183 --> 01:43:52.268
knee kick
A knee kick

01:43:54.646 --> 01:43:56.814
Next is pounding

01:43:58.024 --> 01:43:59.150
Pounding

01:43:59.150 --> 01:44:00.485
You see the hands going up

01:44:00.485 --> 01:44:03.821
Hold it and go for an armbar

01:44:06.491 --> 01:44:08.117
Game over

01:44:10.328 --> 01:44:11.579
You okay?

01:44:11.829 --> 01:44:13.164
Yes. I'm fine

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:16.918
That's it
Grab the neck

01:44:16.918 --> 01:44:18.002
A knee kick

01:44:18.002 --> 01:44:19.879
A knee kick
A takedown

01:44:22.507 --> 01:44:23.758
Pounding

01:44:23.841 --> 01:44:28.179
After pounding, hold the hand
and throw an armbar

01:44:30.431 --> 01:44:31.724
Are you okay?

01:44:32.517 --> 01:44:33.977
No, I'm not okay

01:44:33.977 --> 01:44:35.186
I'll go easy

01:44:35.186 --> 01:44:36.271
okay

01:44:48.199 --> 01:44:51.536
We should've had a drink
after taping the show that day

01:44:51.703 --> 01:44:54.455
I don't want to drink with someone
who purposely lost the game

01:44:54.706 --> 01:44:57.542
I'm sorry about that day
I didn't think much about it

01:44:57.625 --> 01:44:59.877
If we really fought,
who would've won?

01:45:00.545 --> 01:45:01.838
I don't know

01:45:02.046 --> 01:45:03.589
You, me, and Shin Jae-seok

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:06.676
We might fight at the tournament

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:10.847
But I have to win this time
I have my reasons

01:45:11.097 --> 01:45:12.473
Me too

01:45:12.932 --> 01:45:15.184
Let's forget everything
when this is over

01:45:16.853 --> 01:45:18.187
You haven't changed

01:45:19.522 --> 01:45:22.108
You've always been the cool one

01:45:22.567 --> 01:45:24.193
and I was the mean one

01:45:24.485 --> 01:45:26.738
There's nothing cool or mean about it

01:45:27.071 --> 01:45:29.032
We were all young

01:45:29.782 --> 01:45:32.243
Young and stupid

01:45:34.078 --> 01:45:35.788
You're still the cool one

01:45:48.176 --> 01:45:51.637
You think this is your bedroom?

01:45:58.102 --> 01:45:59.645
Which one is Son Jin-ho?

01:46:01.564 --> 01:46:03.566
I'm Shin Jae-seok
Shin Jae-seok

01:46:03.566 --> 01:46:04.734
Come out

01:46:08.154 --> 01:46:09.405
Wait in here for a bit

01:46:21.876 --> 01:46:23.002
Yes, chief

01:46:24.754 --> 01:46:27.632
You all right?
I was so worried about you

01:46:29.092 --> 01:46:32.678
Please make sure your dad
doesn't worry too much about this

01:46:36.265 --> 01:46:40.019
You're 18. What do you want
to do with your life?

01:46:40.770 --> 01:46:43.106
You want to come in and out
of the prison?

01:46:45.316 --> 01:46:46.859
Listen to me carefully

01:46:47.777 --> 01:46:54.492
I'll introduce you to a person
who will save you from all

01:46:56.327 --> 01:46:58.871
Or you can call your
parents to pick you up

01:46:59.163 --> 01:47:01.290
and go in front of the judge later

01:47:01.499 --> 01:47:03.418
I'll go with the first option

01:47:18.850 --> 01:47:20.184
Go on

01:47:20.518 --> 01:47:22.520
That's the good guy
I've told you about

01:47:33.114 --> 01:47:34.198
Get in

01:48:13.571 --> 01:48:16.949
Today, you become adults

01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:22.330
In the world of adults,
you can't always win by working hard

01:48:22.705 --> 01:48:26.375
A person who knows how to win, wins

01:48:27.084 --> 01:48:32.215
We're trying to get every person
in this lot to sign the contract

01:48:32.924 --> 01:48:37.386
And one guy is holding out

01:48:38.221 --> 01:48:40.806
Do you how to win that?

01:48:41.933 --> 01:48:43.809
You threaten him

01:48:45.436 --> 01:48:47.605
At the end of the hallway
on the 3rd floor,

01:48:47.647 --> 01:48:49.732
there's an office without a sign

01:48:49.982 --> 01:48:52.109
There will be a guy sitting alone

01:48:53.444 --> 01:48:56.197
Stab his stomach
two, three times and come back

01:48:56.447 --> 01:48:59.450
If you bring back the knife,
there's no evidence

01:49:01.911 --> 01:49:03.788
You saw my cop friend

01:49:03.871 --> 01:49:07.542
Those cops won't come
near this area today

01:49:08.125 --> 01:49:11.921
All my kids are dying to do this job

01:49:11.921 --> 01:49:13.297
Why?

01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:15.633
Because they want to succeed
with one shot

01:49:16.175 --> 01:49:23.432
But I want to give you guys
this opportunity

01:49:23.641 --> 01:49:24.892
Why?

01:49:25.810 --> 01:49:28.646
Because I want to teach you
how to win

01:49:28.688 --> 01:49:30.565
- Thank you
- Hey

01:49:30.773 --> 01:49:33.109
I'll wait here
Hurry and finish the job

01:49:33.150 --> 01:49:36.070
You just lay low for a while
It's game over

01:49:36.153 --> 01:49:36.988
Yes, sir

01:49:37.029 --> 01:49:38.614
Shin Jae-seok

01:49:41.993 --> 01:49:44.328
Come on

01:49:45.288 --> 01:49:46.622
Shit

01:50:02.346 --> 01:50:03.681
Shin Jae-seok

01:50:06.017 --> 01:50:10.187
This is so wrong

01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:11.522
What is?

01:50:11.731 --> 01:50:13.232
This is wrong

01:50:13.274 --> 01:50:16.360
If you can't do it, then go
I'll do it alone

01:50:21.907 --> 01:50:23.200
Deok-kyu

01:50:27.246 --> 01:50:28.539
Don't go outside

01:50:28.873 --> 01:50:29.999
<i>HEY</i>

01:50:30.666 --> 01:50:31.876
Sang-hoon

01:50:35.463 --> 01:50:38.299
Deok-kyu
We were duped

01:50:39.634 --> 01:50:41.469
There's nobody here

01:50:41.761 --> 01:50:43.512
Nobody's fucking waiting

01:50:43.512 --> 01:50:46.265
Let's go tell Jae-seok

01:50:46.265 --> 01:50:47.892
Forget it

01:50:48.684 --> 01:50:50.353
He won't stab anyone

01:50:50.603 --> 01:50:52.897
Let's fucking study
and go to college

01:50:53.606 --> 01:50:55.524
Get hold of yourself, asshole

01:50:55.524 --> 01:50:57.401
You get hold of yourself

01:50:57.443 --> 01:51:01.405
You don't want to do it either
Why did you follow him?

01:51:01.572 --> 01:51:02.657
Lee Sang-hoon

01:51:04.075 --> 01:51:05.660
Lee Sang-hoon!

01:51:34.271 --> 01:51:35.648
Please help me

01:51:51.205 --> 01:51:52.623
<i>Jae-seek</i>

01:51:53.541 --> 01:51:57.461
Deok-kyu
I'm scared

01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:05.761
Let's go
Come on

01:52:13.811 --> 01:52:15.813
Just run

01:52:21.610 --> 01:52:22.987
Hurry

01:52:36.333 --> 01:52:37.668
It's the 3rd floor
Get him

01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:50.264
I'm Shin Jae-seok from
South Seoul High

01:53:16.874 --> 01:53:18.584
You were here

01:53:19.251 --> 01:53:21.170
What are you doing here
at this hour?

01:53:22.254 --> 01:53:25.883
Deok-kyu
Can we go somewhere together?

01:53:29.804 --> 01:53:31.764
Hello
Come this way

01:53:42.399 --> 01:53:46.070
Nice to meet you
I'm Ahn Yong-chul

01:54:02.378 --> 01:54:05.714
You know Choi Joong-man,
Mr. Turtle

01:54:12.638 --> 01:54:15.891
<i>Jae-seek says we've met before</i>

01:54:15.891 --> 01:54:18.602
But I just don't remember

01:54:21.105 --> 01:54:23.399
Have a seat

01:54:37.746 --> 01:54:40.249
How long ago?
25 years ago?

01:54:40.666 --> 01:54:41.917
Yes

01:54:42.626 --> 01:54:45.963
Back then, I was involved
with organized crime

01:54:45.963 --> 01:54:49.633
Now, I just run a normal business
This is my shop

01:54:49.633 --> 01:54:52.386
My daughter is waiting
I have to get back soon

01:54:52.636 --> 01:54:56.974
I see
Then let's make this short

01:54:57.641 --> 01:55:00.311
Do you know sports betting sites?

01:55:00.644 --> 01:55:03.522
I'm running one

01:55:03.522 --> 01:55:04.940
And?

01:55:08.819 --> 01:55:11.113
Aren't you short tempered?

01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:13.032
Listen closely

01:55:13.824 --> 01:55:17.995
This Match of Legends
is up on our site

01:55:18.037 --> 01:55:23.042
Naturally, I'm going to bet on
my kid Joong-man

01:55:23.667 --> 01:55:25.669
You've seen the tournament chart

01:55:25.753 --> 01:55:28.923
You're up against Joong-man
for the semi-final

01:55:29.006 --> 01:55:31.675
And that's practically the final round

01:55:32.009 --> 01:55:34.887
Comparing the skills or physique

01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:37.389
my Joong-man will certainly win

01:55:37.473 --> 01:55:39.433
I lied to the TV producers

01:55:39.433 --> 01:55:46.023
but he's been preparing to become
a professional athlete for a long time

01:55:49.443 --> 01:55:50.903
<i>Mr. Um?</i>

01:55:51.236 --> 01:55:53.614
Let's be honest

01:55:54.406 --> 01:55:56.742
You need that $200,000

01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:02.623
Here is $200,000

01:56:04.917 --> 01:56:07.169
I don't need that

01:56:07.169 --> 01:56:10.381
I'm not here to get
that petty money

01:56:11.465 --> 01:56:13.050
So don't think too hard

01:56:13.133 --> 01:56:16.971
You just need to hit few times
then let him win

01:56:18.097 --> 01:56:20.683
Did you pay off the other 6 players?

01:56:22.017 --> 01:56:25.854
No
I'm not that rich

01:56:26.105 --> 01:56:32.945
Jae-seok and other 40-somethings
are just sidekicks

01:56:33.362 --> 01:56:36.198
<i>You admit that too
fight, Jae-seek?</i>

01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:45.457
Are you going to chase
after the uncertain prize money?

01:56:45.708 --> 01:56:52.589
Or take my certain $200,000
Make your choice

01:56:57.136 --> 01:57:01.223
Of all things,
think about your child

01:57:01.265 --> 01:57:05.144
Are you going to make your daughter
sleep in a restaurant?

01:57:13.110 --> 01:57:16.113
Mr. Lim
You're a father, all right

01:57:19.408 --> 01:57:20.492
Deok-kyu

01:57:24.496 --> 01:57:26.081
You made money, huh?

01:57:26.957 --> 01:57:31.170
Noodle shop owner makes it big,
a $200,000 overnight

01:57:32.963 --> 01:57:34.798
You got more to say?

01:57:35.257 --> 01:57:39.136
You want some sort of fee
or something?

01:57:40.554 --> 01:57:42.473
You've changed a lot

01:57:44.058 --> 01:57:46.310
Guess no one can win against time

01:57:46.477 --> 01:57:49.146
Mr. perfect Lim Deok-kyu
crumbles in front of money

01:57:49.229 --> 01:57:52.149
What do you want from me?

01:57:52.566 --> 01:57:54.485
Isn't this what you want?

01:57:56.361 --> 01:57:57.863
Let go

01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:01.325
We can fight at the tournament

01:58:04.369 --> 01:58:08.499
Frankly, I thought you'd refuse

01:58:08.791 --> 01:58:10.876
That's the Lim Deok-kyu I know

01:58:11.126 --> 01:58:14.546
I can't ever do it,
but you can

01:58:19.176 --> 01:58:20.719
Are you embarrassed?

01:58:25.432 --> 01:58:29.144
Then I'll try to finish
what you couldn't

01:58:36.026 --> 01:58:37.778
See you in the ring

01:58:41.907 --> 01:58:45.452
You did good
You made money anyway

01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:17.484
Long time no see

01:59:17.568 --> 01:59:18.610
How are your kids?

01:59:18.610 --> 01:59:22.114
I'm a bachelor
Don't I look like a college student?

01:59:37.087 --> 01:59:38.505
Lim Soo-bin

01:59:47.139 --> 01:59:48.765
You have to win

01:59:51.768 --> 01:59:52.936
Is this your daughter?

01:59:54.396 --> 01:59:56.231
Soo-bin. Say hello
They are my friends

01:59:56.732 --> 01:59:58.567
Hello

02:00:01.904 --> 02:00:03.155
Is she your real daughter?

02:00:31.266 --> 02:00:33.894
It's a live TV so focus

02:00:34.144 --> 02:00:35.812
Do you want to be the producer?

02:00:36.271 --> 02:00:37.522
Maybe I should

02:00:40.067 --> 02:00:41.235
Standby

02:00:55.165 --> 02:00:58.710
They are your brothers and uncles

02:00:59.086 --> 02:01:00.671
They are your fathers

02:01:01.338 --> 02:01:05.092
Tonight's contestants are
regular people like you

02:01:05.717 --> 02:01:09.513
The Match of Legends will begin now

02:02:08.989 --> 02:02:10.615
Stop. stop!

02:02:25.172 --> 02:02:26.590
A High Kick

02:02:27.507 --> 02:02:29.885
Mr. Lee is incredible

02:02:43.607 --> 02:02:45.400
There goes an armbar
An armbar

02:02:47.110 --> 02:02:49.529
Stop. stop!
Stop. stop!

02:02:49.529 --> 02:02:51.448
Game over

02:02:51.448 --> 02:02:54.951
That technique
I taught him that myself

02:03:04.586 --> 02:03:06.421
Final match of the first round

02:03:06.588 --> 02:03:09.800
The front-runner
Mr. Turtle, Choi Joong-man

02:03:09.841 --> 02:03:11.718
His opponent is the street fighter,

02:03:11.718 --> 02:03:13.720
- Mr. Shin Jae-seok!
- The instructions

02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:16.473
No headbutts,
soccer kicks, and elbows

02:03:16.807 --> 02:03:19.059
Hey
Elbow

02:03:20.352 --> 02:03:23.647
E.L.B.O.W

02:03:23.730 --> 02:03:25.399
Elbow

02:03:26.191 --> 02:03:27.651
To your corners

02:03:36.159 --> 02:03:38.745
The match begins

02:03:46.002 --> 02:03:47.337
A knee kick

02:03:47.421 --> 02:03:50.298
Choi starts aggressive
from the beginning

02:03:52.551 --> 02:03:54.177
Another knee kick

02:03:58.014 --> 02:03:59.599
Look at that

02:03:59.599 --> 02:04:01.685
Shin is putting up a pretty
good fight

02:04:01.685 --> 02:04:04.938
Shin is having a hand-to-hand
combat with Choi

02:04:28.712 --> 02:04:30.505
Choi throws in a choke

02:04:30.547 --> 02:04:32.299
Shin is in danger

02:04:32.299 --> 02:04:33.633
Let's end this

02:04:37.387 --> 02:04:39.389
Let's end it

02:04:53.403 --> 02:04:54.905
Come here

02:04:55.405 --> 02:04:57.073
You come here
Come here

02:04:57.073 --> 02:04:59.576
After Shin miraculously holds up
the first round,

02:04:59.576 --> 02:05:01.661
he has a different style
for round 2

02:05:01.661 --> 02:05:02.537
Wait

02:05:02.537 --> 02:05:04.456
- Referee is stopping the bout
- A warning

02:05:04.456 --> 02:05:05.332
What?

02:05:05.332 --> 02:05:06.291
Fight

02:05:06.291 --> 02:05:08.710
This is my strategy
Avoiding by running away

02:05:08.793 --> 02:05:09.836
That's right

02:05:09.836 --> 02:05:11.087
- Purely with strength,
- Fight

02:05:11.087 --> 02:05:13.423
Shin can't win against Choi

02:05:13.423 --> 02:05:18.762
Shin knows that
so he uses his head

02:05:18.762 --> 02:05:22.807
<i>Now, Choi will take
a big physical toll</i>

02:05:30.106 --> 02:05:32.692
Choi thought this was going
to be an easy win

02:05:32.692 --> 02:05:34.694
But he looks so exhausted

02:05:34.778 --> 02:05:38.281
No one imagined this fight
would go to round 3

02:05:38.281 --> 02:05:39.282
Fight

02:05:43.286 --> 02:05:44.955
<i>I'm Shin Jae-seek</i>

02:05:53.004 --> 02:05:54.130
A warning

02:05:54.172 --> 02:05:55.048
What?

02:05:55.048 --> 02:05:56.633
Cheer up, bastard

02:06:05.725 --> 02:06:06.893
It's the guillotine choke

02:06:06.893 --> 02:06:08.979
Mr. Turtle turns the game
around in matter of seconds

02:06:08.979 --> 02:06:11.982
This is Choi's best technique

02:06:11.982 --> 02:06:13.942
This one is hard to escape

02:06:14.484 --> 02:06:16.903
Shin desperately tries to get out

02:06:16.903 --> 02:06:18.530
He seems to be in a lot of pain

02:06:21.575 --> 02:06:24.077
- Stop, stop!
- A tap out. Game over

02:06:24.077 --> 02:06:26.496
Choi, Mr. Turtle is the winner

02:06:26.496 --> 02:06:28.790
The game went as expected

02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:31.084
But Shin put up a good fight

02:06:31.167 --> 02:06:35.547
Yes. He lost, but his intelligent
play was superb

02:06:47.892 --> 02:06:49.352
What are you doing?

02:06:49.436 --> 02:06:52.022
I tried hard not to look so obvious

02:07:01.072 --> 02:07:02.365
Go Lee Sang-hoon

02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:11.374
Did you see?

02:07:13.710 --> 02:07:16.630
He spent about
half of his strength on me

02:07:25.555 --> 02:07:27.557
I know you'll lose

02:07:29.059 --> 02:07:30.852
but I want you to know

02:07:44.908 --> 02:07:50.330
Lee Sang-hoon vs. Yoo Tae-kyung
It's the first match of the semi-finals

02:07:51.247 --> 02:07:55.877
Lee often uses kicks,
but he has yet to attack

02:07:57.045 --> 02:07:59.964
Yoo learned mixed martial arts
as a hobby

02:07:59.964 --> 02:08:02.717
He's cleverly using
his ground-fighting skills

02:08:02.801 --> 02:08:05.261
Lee is holding up pretty well

02:08:05.261 --> 02:08:07.555
but it's a tough fight

02:08:10.892 --> 02:08:12.894
Pounding by Lee!

02:08:13.144 --> 02:08:17.107
Yoo is trying everything
to get close to the ground

02:08:17.107 --> 02:08:18.817
Closer he gets,
more damaging it is

02:08:30.662 --> 02:08:33.039
Lee's middle kick hits
right on the spot

02:08:33.456 --> 02:08:34.874
Lee's strike continues

02:08:34.874 --> 02:08:36.126
He grabs the chance

02:08:36.126 --> 02:08:39.462
Lee is bringing out
his best techniques

02:08:39.796 --> 02:08:41.965
<i>But 'loo counterattacks</i>

02:08:42.090 --> 02:08:43.633
Can he reverse the situation?

02:08:46.636 --> 02:08:49.264
Yoo's attack continues with
Kimura attack

02:08:49.264 --> 02:08:50.306
The situation has reversed

02:08:50.306 --> 02:08:52.851
Lee is in dangerous situation

02:08:59.149 --> 02:09:01.234
A kneebar

02:09:01.234 --> 02:09:04.446
Lee seems to be in a lot of pain

02:09:04.487 --> 02:09:07.615
Will the idol of 10 million white-collars
go down like this?

02:09:15.665 --> 02:09:18.793
It's the triangle choke

02:09:18.877 --> 02:09:21.421
Yes. Lee gets in position

02:09:29.679 --> 02:09:31.347
- A tap out
- Stop

02:09:31.347 --> 02:09:33.558
- Lee Sang-hoon
- Bravo

02:09:34.309 --> 02:09:36.352
<i>Lee Sang hoon to the Finals</i>

02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:42.859
Mr. Park. I think Sang-hoon
went on the show for the money

02:09:42.859 --> 02:09:44.944
Raise $100,000 to his salary
and bring him back right away

02:09:44.944 --> 02:09:45.862
Yes, sir

02:09:45.862 --> 02:09:47.197
I feel so lonely these days

02:09:47.197 --> 02:09:49.491
- Cheers
- Cheers

02:09:49.866 --> 02:09:52.619
Lee Sang-hoon,
the idol of white-collars

02:09:52.619 --> 02:09:54.496
He didn't let the 10 million
white-collars down

02:09:54.496 --> 02:09:56.998
He made it to the finals

02:09:57.248 --> 02:10:00.919
I think Lee was injured

02:10:03.713 --> 02:10:06.174
Mr. Lee, are you okay?

02:10:07.383 --> 02:10:09.135
Where does it hurt the most?

02:10:09.135 --> 02:10:10.970
Is it your leg?
Your knee?

02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:12.388
I'm okay

02:10:12.722 --> 02:10:14.766
Are you going to make it
to the finals?

02:10:14.933 --> 02:10:16.392
I'm fine

02:10:17.185 --> 02:10:18.770
That's good

02:10:18.770 --> 02:10:22.065
Between Choi and Lim,

02:10:22.065 --> 02:10:23.900
who would you like to fight
at the finals?

02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:25.485
It doesn't matter

02:10:26.319 --> 02:10:29.489
Is it because you're confident
that you'll win?

02:10:29.489 --> 02:10:30.990
Yes
I'm here to win

02:10:32.742 --> 02:10:34.869
- He's so cool Lee Sang-hoon
- That was

02:10:34.869 --> 02:10:36.162
- He's a man
- Lee Sang-hoon

02:10:38.540 --> 02:10:39.582
Mr. Lee

02:10:41.251 --> 02:10:42.418
Mr. Lee

02:10:42.919 --> 02:10:45.171
- We need paramedics
- Step back

02:10:46.089 --> 02:10:47.340
Mr. Lee

02:10:47.423 --> 02:10:49.008
What's wrong?

02:10:49.551 --> 02:10:52.345
Take emergency measures
He needs to go to the finals

02:11:13.616 --> 02:11:15.785
Shouldn't you go see a doctor?

02:11:16.119 --> 02:11:17.704
It's okay
I'm all right

02:11:17.954 --> 02:11:19.873
You want to fight with
a body like this?

02:11:19.956 --> 02:11:21.833
You want me to give up?

02:11:22.083 --> 02:11:24.002
$200,000 must be a lot of money

02:11:24.002 --> 02:11:25.795
It's not about the money

02:11:26.045 --> 02:11:29.299
I want to fight fair and square
till the end

02:11:29.382 --> 02:11:33.094
Sang-hoon, you're awesome
You're different from someone

02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:37.140
You know the Turtle
will go to the finals

02:11:37.140 --> 02:11:40.101
If you go up against like that,
you could die

02:11:40.351 --> 02:11:42.687
He won't let you get off easily

02:11:42.896 --> 02:11:44.606
Second match of the semi-finals

02:11:44.606 --> 02:11:47.066
The highlight of tonight's tournament

02:11:52.864 --> 02:11:55.533
With a face of the Grim Reaper

02:11:55.742 --> 02:11:58.494
The best of the best
The Turtle

02:11:58.536 --> 02:12:00.079
Mr. Choi Joong-man

02:12:03.082 --> 02:12:05.001
Mr. Lim
You need to go up

02:12:07.337 --> 02:12:08.671
Yes, Sang-hoon

02:12:09.005 --> 02:12:11.507
You can't fight the Turtle
in this condition

02:12:11.549 --> 02:12:13.092
Give up and go to the hospital

02:12:13.092 --> 02:12:16.054
Why do you only think
the Turtle will win, bastards?

02:12:19.933 --> 02:12:23.311
Deok-kyu, don't you have
any self-confidence?

02:12:23.686 --> 02:12:25.355
Are you that scared of the Turtle?

02:12:39.786 --> 02:12:40.954
Scared?

02:12:58.554 --> 02:12:59.973
Mr. Lim
Hurry

02:13:01.933 --> 02:13:03.101
<i>Jae-seek</i>

02:13:33.214 --> 02:13:35.842
This is an exciting match

02:13:36.009 --> 02:13:38.886
The Grim Reaper
vs. the Devil himself

02:13:39.137 --> 02:13:42.390
Two best fighters of
Legendary Fighter

02:13:45.935 --> 02:13:49.731
It might end as soon as it starts
so stay alert

02:13:49.772 --> 02:13:51.107
I bet on Mr. Turtle

02:13:51.107 --> 02:13:52.775
Round 1 begins

02:13:52.775 --> 02:13:53.860
Fight

02:13:58.614 --> 02:14:01.117
They're engaging in
reconnaissance

02:14:01.367 --> 02:14:03.453
During the first round,
he used a lot of his strength

02:14:03.494 --> 02:14:05.455
But Choi still seems relaxed

02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:16.966
Hit me

02:14:16.966 --> 02:14:19.677
Choi is provoking Lim

02:14:19.969 --> 02:14:23.306
Lim should not play into
Choi's scheme

02:14:26.642 --> 02:14:28.186
A left high kick

02:14:28.186 --> 02:14:30.146
Choi pushes Lim back with punches

02:14:40.907 --> 02:14:43.993
A strong takedown

02:14:44.452 --> 02:14:46.079
And a choke

02:14:46.162 --> 02:14:48.915
Lim is in dangerous situation

02:14:48.998 --> 02:14:51.584
Aren't Choi's ground skills superb?

02:14:51.584 --> 02:14:54.003
It won't be easy to
get out of that hold

02:14:54.170 --> 02:14:56.631
Is the bout going to end like this?

02:14:57.340 --> 02:15:00.009
<i>Lim fights back with all his might</i>

02:15:00.093 --> 02:15:02.595
<i>He is holding up
as much as he can</i>

02:15:02.595 --> 02:15:04.806
<i>But Choi is just too powerful</i>

02:15:13.773 --> 02:15:14.690
He's out

02:15:14.690 --> 02:15:16.818
He got out of the choke hold

02:15:17.527 --> 02:15:20.029
But Choi doesn't give him
any time to rest

02:15:20.113 --> 02:15:21.197
A left hook

02:15:21.197 --> 02:15:22.698
One, two
A punch in the abdomen

02:15:22.698 --> 02:15:24.867
Continues with a stream of punches

02:15:28.121 --> 02:15:30.414
One more takedown

02:15:30.623 --> 02:15:31.833
An armbar

02:15:31.874 --> 02:15:35.086
Choi is displaying
superhuman strength

02:15:37.088 --> 02:15:38.631
<i>Lim seems to be in pain</i>

02:15:38.631 --> 02:15:39.549
Oh my

02:15:39.549 --> 02:15:43.344
He is holding up again
with all his might

02:15:48.057 --> 02:15:50.101
- End of round 1
- Stop, stop

02:15:50.101 --> 02:15:52.895
- Lim escapes from the danger
- Release him

02:15:53.271 --> 02:15:56.315
Choi shows lack of sportsmanship

02:15:56.399 --> 02:15:59.235
He did that last time
and lost by disqualification

02:15:59.235 --> 02:16:02.113
- That bastard
- Jae-seok

02:16:04.323 --> 02:16:05.491
Are you okay?

02:16:05.575 --> 02:16:06.868
It's fun

02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:08.828
She must be his real daughter

02:16:10.371 --> 02:16:13.207
Now, two contestants are getting
too emotional

02:16:15.042 --> 02:16:18.588
It is so different from when they were
fighting for $20,000

02:16:18.671 --> 02:16:21.215
$20,000 and $200,000
are very different

02:16:21.507 --> 02:16:24.594
Do you think they are fighting
hard for the prize money?

02:16:24.594 --> 02:16:25.595
They're not?

02:16:25.595 --> 02:16:29.432
Martial arts athletes bet their souls
in the ring

02:16:29.515 --> 02:16:30.600
Fight

02:16:45.489 --> 02:16:46.781
A low kick

02:16:46.949 --> 02:16:50.161
Lim's movement seems better

02:16:50.952 --> 02:16:52.705
Another low kick

02:17:14.518 --> 02:17:17.313
It's the guillotine choke

02:17:17.396 --> 02:17:19.440
<i>Lim seems to be suffering</i>

02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:22.317
Shin went down for this technique
during the first round

02:17:22.317 --> 02:17:24.236
He cannot escape from that

02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:26.364
It's cutting off air completely

02:17:26.656 --> 02:17:27.740
<i>He's in pain</i>

02:17:27.740 --> 02:17:31.451
What are you doing, Deok-kyu?
Hit him on the side

02:17:31.451 --> 02:17:33.537
Right there
It's open

02:17:33.537 --> 02:17:34.664
Hit him

02:17:34.956 --> 02:17:36.332
Jae-seok
Turn it off

02:17:36.415 --> 02:17:37.500
What?

02:17:37.583 --> 02:17:38.876
Leave it on

02:17:39.794 --> 02:17:42.879
My dad won't lose
He can't

02:17:50.888 --> 02:17:53.683
- He gets out. Mr. Lim Deok-kyu
- That's it

02:17:53.683 --> 02:17:55.393
- Okay. That's good
- Okay

02:17:55.393 --> 02:17:56.184
Yes

02:17:56.477 --> 02:18:00.522
Yes. It's a miracle to escape
from a choke twice

02:18:00.606 --> 02:18:04.277
Choi probably thought
he finished the bout

02:18:04.485 --> 02:18:08.114
Choi seems to have taken
a big blow in the abdomen

02:18:11.075 --> 02:18:13.536
End of Round 2

02:18:13.536 --> 02:18:16.580
The two contestants are
showing a true fighting spirit

02:18:16.580 --> 02:18:20.041
We expected no worthy
opponent for Choi

02:18:20.041 --> 02:18:22.503
But the bout is going
into the final round

02:18:36.225 --> 02:18:38.852
Lim throws a superman punch

02:18:39.061 --> 02:18:39.895
A left hook

02:18:39.978 --> 02:18:41.647
Once again
A left hook

02:18:41.897 --> 02:18:43.398
A left hook
Down!

02:18:43.441 --> 02:18:45.735
Lim throws powerful punches

02:18:47.028 --> 02:18:48.111
Doing good

02:18:48.404 --> 02:18:49.864
You have to thank me for that

02:19:02.251 --> 02:19:05.546
Lim is waiting for Choi to get up

02:19:05.546 --> 02:19:07.630
as he did during the first show

02:19:07.715 --> 02:19:13.304
I think he wants to go back to
the 18 year old boxer at this moment

02:19:13.512 --> 02:19:15.138
You're wonderful
Mr. Lim Deok-kyu

02:19:15.181 --> 02:19:17.433
Choi gets up again

02:19:18.808 --> 02:19:20.144
Punches to the stomach

02:19:20.394 --> 02:19:22.146
Down again

02:19:23.439 --> 02:19:24.106
Fight

02:19:25.107 --> 02:19:26.816
Finish it
Go in

02:19:28.027 --> 02:19:29.236
Get up

02:19:31.197 --> 02:19:32.365
Get up

02:19:37.119 --> 02:19:40.498
A left hook
Choi is down for the third time

02:19:40.498 --> 02:19:43.793
Lim's blows are hitting accurately
right on the mark

02:19:50.049 --> 02:19:51.217
Get up

02:19:54.345 --> 02:19:55.721
Go Lim Deok-kyu

02:20:02.269 --> 02:20:04.563
Deok-kyu told me to return this

02:20:10.444 --> 02:20:11.904
Get up

02:20:18.327 --> 02:20:21.288
Hey
You promised to let me win

02:20:22.498 --> 02:20:23.916
When?

02:20:27.545 --> 02:20:29.171
A backdrop suplex

02:20:29.171 --> 02:20:32.758
Choi reverses the situation
with one backdrop suplex

02:20:32.758 --> 02:20:34.677
Mr. Turtle is still alive

02:20:34.677 --> 02:20:38.556
Look at that pounding
It's ruthless

02:20:39.014 --> 02:20:42.560
Lim seems to have
taken a big damage

02:22:14.985 --> 02:22:17.905
- Stop, stop
- Referee stops

02:22:18.447 --> 02:22:22.409
Lim wins the bloody battle
He's great

02:22:22.409 --> 02:22:23.786
- He's amazing
- Winner

02:22:23.786 --> 02:22:26.580
This is amazing
It was the best bout ever

02:22:27.498 --> 02:22:29.124
<i>Lim Deok-kyu to the finals!</i>

02:22:34.547 --> 02:22:36.048
Isn't your dad awesome?

02:22:40.135 --> 02:22:43.430
Go, Lim Deok-kyu!

02:22:54.608 --> 02:22:58.279
I was tipped off that someone
is trying to rig the game

02:22:58.320 --> 02:22:59.822
Do you know anything about that?

02:23:01.865 --> 02:23:02.992
No, sir

02:23:03.075 --> 02:23:04.285
Oh really?

02:23:11.333 --> 02:23:13.836
Look at this
Look at the ratings

02:23:16.922 --> 02:23:18.924
Get me new graphics quickly

02:23:18.924 --> 02:23:20.467
Friendship or money?

02:23:20.509 --> 02:23:22.511
Two high school classmates
Lee vs. Lim

02:23:22.511 --> 02:23:24.555
Their ill-fated finals
Okay?

02:23:33.105 --> 02:23:37.359
Mr. Lim. You're great
Congratulations

02:23:37.443 --> 02:23:38.861
How do you feel right now?

02:23:45.159 --> 02:23:49.997
Now the dramatic finals
of the two classmates has come

02:23:50.748 --> 02:23:54.335
For the $200,000,
you will have to win

02:23:54.335 --> 02:23:56.629
Do you feel disturbed?

02:23:56.712 --> 02:23:59.882
How will you fight the finals?

02:24:01.008 --> 02:24:05.262
I'm done
I don't want to fight anymore

02:24:09.224 --> 02:24:10.517
<i>What?</i>

02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:14.188
Why should two friends fight?

02:24:15.898 --> 02:24:18.567
Mr. Lim Deok-kyu!

02:24:20.986 --> 02:24:22.112
Get Lim Deok-kyu

02:24:22.196 --> 02:24:23.238
okay

02:24:26.241 --> 02:24:27.326
Please

02:24:28.535 --> 02:24:30.537
What is he doing?

02:24:30.829 --> 02:24:33.707
Emcee, talk about something,
buy time

02:24:34.208 --> 02:24:38.087
Mr. Lim just displayed
an unpredictable behavior

02:24:38.128 --> 02:24:41.757
I think he's still excited
from the earlier match

02:24:41.757 --> 02:24:45.219
No. Go follow him for an interview
or bring him back

02:24:45.511 --> 02:24:47.596
But he can't give up like this

02:24:47.596 --> 02:24:50.933
He can't be so irresponsible
in front of all the audiences

02:24:50.933 --> 02:24:54.645
I'll go meet Mr. Lim
and try to convince him

02:24:56.230 --> 02:24:57.439
Move, Jason

02:24:57.523 --> 02:25:00.317
Please respect the noble decision
of an martial arts athlete

02:25:00.401 --> 02:25:02.444
What are you talking about?
Move, Jason

02:25:06.448 --> 02:25:07.408
An armbar

02:25:11.620 --> 02:25:12.955
Game over

02:25:13.455 --> 02:25:15.541
What are you doing, Jason?

02:25:15.958 --> 02:25:19.628
Mr. Lim
Please wait

02:25:21.797 --> 02:25:22.965
Mr. Lim Deok-kyu

02:25:26.093 --> 02:25:28.804
You can't do this
This is a live show

02:25:28.804 --> 02:25:30.514
You're about to stop
a live broadcast

02:25:30.723 --> 02:25:33.100
You have to keep your
promise with the viewers

02:25:40.733 --> 02:25:41.817
Dad

02:25:42.151 --> 02:25:43.235
Soo-bin

02:25:45.571 --> 02:25:46.989
Why did you change your clothes?

02:25:48.490 --> 02:25:49.908
You told me to go see a doctor

02:25:50.117 --> 02:25:51.535
You don't want to fight either?

02:25:51.869 --> 02:25:55.080
Why do you always have
to be the cool one?

02:25:55.581 --> 02:25:57.291
Let me be the cool one today

02:25:58.834 --> 02:26:01.211
Wait up
I'll go with you

02:26:01.378 --> 02:26:04.006
- Deok-kyu
- What are you two doing?

02:26:06.175 --> 02:26:09.595
You think you two run this show

02:26:09.678 --> 02:26:11.972
But I created this show

02:26:12.264 --> 02:26:14.433
I bet $200,000

02:26:14.516 --> 02:26:17.686
So you go back in that chicken coop
and fight or chew each other

02:26:17.936 --> 02:26:20.355
And take your $200,000

02:26:20.355 --> 02:26:21.648
Ms. Hong

02:26:23.650 --> 02:26:25.778
Come and eat noodles
sometime

02:26:27.905 --> 02:26:32.034
Mr. Lim. Is it so important
to act like a man?

02:26:32.117 --> 02:26:34.286
When $200,000 is about to
slip through your fingers?

02:26:36.288 --> 02:26:37.539
Ms. Hong

02:26:37.915 --> 02:26:39.124
What?

02:26:39.208 --> 02:26:41.043
Is it a big deal to stop a live show?

02:26:41.084 --> 02:26:43.754
Of course
They'll fire me for good

02:26:43.837 --> 02:26:46.048
You don't have to
stop broadcasting the show

02:26:47.716 --> 02:26:50.469
Every sports has something called
win by withdrawal

02:26:50.552 --> 02:26:53.222
Do you need two chickens
in that cage?

02:26:53.472 --> 02:26:56.517
I'll go in alone
and receive my $200,000

02:26:56.517 --> 02:26:58.393
I'll smile for the camera

02:27:04.233 --> 02:27:05.734
Prepare the caption

02:27:05.734 --> 02:27:07.611
Lim Deok-kyu chooses friendship

02:27:07.653 --> 02:27:09.863
Lee Sang-hoon chooses money

02:27:09.905 --> 02:27:11.657
- Yes, ma'am
- And

02:27:12.032 --> 02:27:15.744
Put a trailer up for Legendary Fighter 2:
The Women Fighters

02:27:16.119 --> 02:27:17.162
okay

02:27:19.915 --> 02:27:21.959
You're lucky
to have a good friend

02:27:21.959 --> 02:27:23.919
You're getting $200,000
without a fight

02:27:24.002 --> 02:27:26.338
I'm going to split it with Deok-kyu

02:27:27.089 --> 02:27:28.757
That's a promise

02:27:32.803 --> 02:27:35.889
That's some flexibility you got there

02:27:36.348 --> 02:27:38.600
I've worked at an office for 17 years

02:27:47.317 --> 02:27:49.570
<i>It was a fierce tournament</i>

02:27:49.570 --> 02:27:53.699
<i>The winner, Lee Sang-hoon
is entering the stadium</i>

02:28:04.793 --> 02:28:05.919
Daddy

02:28:07.713 --> 02:28:08.881
What is it?

02:28:09.756 --> 02:28:11.633
I've decided to go back to school

02:28:12.885 --> 02:28:15.804
You're not going to transfer?

02:28:16.388 --> 02:28:21.143
Yeah. I'm going to go
face-to-face like you

02:28:23.979 --> 02:28:26.398
What if they bully you even more?

02:28:26.481 --> 02:28:28.233
You told me to stab
with a fountain pen

02:28:28.483 --> 02:28:30.485
That's not good

02:28:30.694 --> 02:28:32.321
I'm joking

02:28:33.155 --> 02:28:36.491
I'm going to forget about it all
and talk to them first

02:28:36.742 --> 02:28:38.327
I have to fight it out

02:28:39.161 --> 02:28:40.996
Something will turn up

02:28:44.458 --> 02:28:47.336
If it gets too hard,
I'll tell you

02:28:49.838 --> 02:28:51.340
Thanks

02:28:59.181 --> 02:29:00.349
Let's go

02:29:03.894 --> 02:29:07.147
But Mr. Lim Deok-kyu is still
not a champion

02:29:07.981 --> 02:29:09.232
I know

02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:11.860
But this is enough

02:29:12.778 --> 02:29:15.989
Champion Lim Deok-kyu!

02:29:45.143 --> 02:29:49.898
