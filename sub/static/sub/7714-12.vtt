WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:04.003
Attention, everyone!

00:04.087 --> 00:05.963
Jim and l, on behalf
of the Party Planning
Committee

00:06.089 --> 00:08.007
have an. . .
Too loud.
Too, too loud. Too loud.

00:08.091 --> 00:12.428
But effective. Look.
On behalf of Jim and l,
Merry Christmas.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.347
ALL: Merry Christmas.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.682
Merry Christmas. Good.

00:16.766 --> 00:19.727
My diabolical plot is
on hold for Christmas.

00:20.270 --> 00:24.064
My heart just melts
with the sound of
children singing.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.775
(LAUGHlNG)

00:27.527 --> 00:31.447
Not really. l'm just tired.
The days are short.
l don't know.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.741
Maybe l'm depressed.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.743
lt is time to
unveil the tree.

00:35.827 --> 00:36.994
Hey, Rockefeller Center!

00:37.078 --> 00:38.162
JlM: Yeah.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.580
Uh, l've actually
been to Rock Center

00:39.664 --> 00:40.706
and this is
nothing like that.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.249
This is all we have.
Ugh !

00:42.333 --> 00:43.751
Nope, it's not "ugh."

00:44.377 --> 00:46.045
lt is office
camaraderie.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.296
lt is warm feelings.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.173
Why don't we
talk more about it
instead of doing it?

00:49.257 --> 00:51.884
Thirty, 29, 28. . .

00:52.010 --> 00:53.385
Why would you
start so high?
. . .27. . .

00:53.470 --> 00:54.470
Three, two, one.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.554
. . .26. . .

00:55.722 --> 00:56.764
PHYLLlS: Ooh !

00:56.848 --> 00:58.057
You didn't decorate it.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.099
No.
Exactly.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.227
We didn't, because
we think it would be better
to do it together.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.188
Everyone.
Why would you
wrap it in a sheet

01:04.272 --> 01:06.315
if you're not
covering anything up?

01:06.399 --> 01:08.317
ls. . . ls it fake?
Pam.

01:08.485 --> 01:13.489
Yes! We are unveiling
an artificial tree
that will never die.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.783
Yes.
Like the spirit
of Christmas.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.076
And we're supposed
to applaud you

01:17.160 --> 01:19.161
for taking a giant
diaper off a fake tree?

01:19.245 --> 01:22.414
This was
a successful unveiling !
Go back to work!

01:22.540 --> 01:24.166
Merry Christmas.

01:45.146 --> 01:48.023
Hello. Sorry, guys.
Sorry, guys.

01:48.191 --> 01:51.110
l'm not sure l've
earned the right to
make announcements yet,

01:51.194 --> 01:53.570
but whoever is
giving me the
1 2 Days of Christmas

01:53.655 --> 01:55.447
as my Secret Santa,

01:55.782 --> 02:01.370
please stop.
l can't take it anymore.
My cat killed a turtledove.

02:01.621 --> 02:05.040
The French hens
have started pulling out
my hair to make a nest.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.792
Please stop.

02:06.876 --> 02:08.877
What psycho would
send that as a gift?

02:12.924 --> 02:15.968
l begged Dwight and Jim
to give me Erin for
Secret Santa,

02:16.052 --> 02:18.345
and I decided to give Erin
the 1 2 Days of Christmas.

02:18.429 --> 02:19.596
Bowtie time.

02:19.681 --> 02:23.684
Is it my fauIt that
the first eight days
there's basicaIIy 30 birds?

02:24.102 --> 02:25.394
Ho! Ho! Ho!

02:25.478 --> 02:30.149
Merry Christmas,
boys and girls.
lt's me, Santa Claus.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.692
Hey, Santa.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.443
They finally
let you do it.
Yeah.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.611
Congrats, Phyl.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.737
lt's so edgy.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.031
PHYLLlS: I have been wanting
to be Santa for years.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.117
l believe l have
the right temperament

02:40.201 --> 02:42.119
and the figure to
do the job well.

02:42.203 --> 02:46.456
I sIipped a note
to Jim 1 1 weeks ago,
and he said l could do it.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.000
(PHYLLlS LAUGHS)

02:49.711 --> 02:51.712
lt's been a long journey.

02:54.465 --> 02:56.258
But l'm Santa Claus!

02:57.677 --> 03:00.429
So, Santa, what can we
expect from this party?

03:00.513 --> 03:03.599
lt's going to be
a very jolly time
if you've been good.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.017
What if you've been bad?

03:05.101 --> 03:07.019
Then nothing but
a lump of coal for you.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.854
What if you've been
really, really bad?

03:08.938 --> 03:11.148
More evil than
strictly wrong.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.692
Hey, Creed?
We covered it.
Lump of coal.

03:13.776 --> 03:14.860
Yeah.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.153
For the past several weeks,

03:16.237 --> 03:19.072
my Secret Santa
has been giving me
pieces of a machine

03:19.157 --> 03:20.824
that l've been
attempting to assembIe.

03:20.909 --> 03:24.912
I'm suspicious of this,
because l had
the exact same idea

03:25.163 --> 03:27.372
for catching Osama bin Laden.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.751
I wouId simpIy send him
a different piece each day.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.545
He would assemble
it to find himself

03:34.172 --> 03:35.422
in jail !

03:37.091 --> 03:39.259
You know, Oscar,
every time l make
this lasagna

03:39.344 --> 03:41.595
people ask me if
it's a family recipe,

03:41.679 --> 03:44.890
but really, l just get
the recipe from the box.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.100
That's funny.

03:47.185 --> 03:50.896
ls it funny?
l thought it was more
interesting than funny.

03:56.861 --> 03:58.570
l think my water
just broke.

03:58.655 --> 03:59.988
That's too funny.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.407
Oscar and
the warehouse guy.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.786
Go, Oscar!
Go, gay warehouse guy!

04:06.996 --> 04:09.164
Here's Santa!

04:09.624 --> 04:12.960
Hey, little girl,
what would you
like for Christmas?

04:13.127 --> 04:16.880
Ooh ! You have been a very
naughty girl, l see.

04:16.965 --> 04:19.091
Michael, we already
have a Santa. Phyllis.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.510
What the hell is going on?

04:23.012 --> 04:25.347
Phyllis, Jim?
Phyllis is Santa?

04:25.682 --> 04:26.723
Yeah.
Phyllis.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.267
Yeah. l told her
a long time ago
she could do it.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.476
Take it back.
That is absurd.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.602
No. l'm not gonna
do that.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.145
No, Jim, come on !

04:32.230 --> 04:33.397
l think she's
doing a good job.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.191
Lately, there have been
serious rumors that
our company's going bankrupt,

04:36.276 --> 04:38.277
so David Wallace asked me
to keep morale high.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.530
So l asked around
about what peopIe wanted
with Christmas,

04:41.739 --> 04:43.824
and l told them
to get creative.

04:43.908 --> 04:47.577
And they didn't reaIIy
get creative, exactIy.

04:47.870 --> 04:51.123
Secret Santa, karaoke, food,

04:51.457 --> 04:54.501
kind of the usuaI thing
that we do here,
which is great.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.295
And peopIe usuaIIy
argue about food,

04:56.379 --> 04:58.547
so I toId everybody
to bring their favorites.

04:58.881 --> 05:00.966
I made an organized
signup sheet for karaoke

05:01.050 --> 05:03.218
so that there was no fighting

05:03.761 --> 05:05.178
and no crying.

05:05.263 --> 05:08.724
l'm doing a good job, l think,
because this year,

05:08.808 --> 05:10.934
l care.

05:12.770 --> 05:15.147
lt's weird. l know.

05:16.774 --> 05:19.484
lt's insane!
A woman Santa?
Where does it stop?

05:19.569 --> 05:23.113
No! Jim, this may
be the last Christmas
that we have here.

05:23.197 --> 05:25.949
Doesn't it make you
a tiny bit anxious,

05:26.034 --> 05:28.368
me not playing Santa?
Come on !

05:29.287 --> 05:31.246
l'm not gonna go tell Phyllis
that she can't be Santa.

05:31.331 --> 05:35.042
Fine. Then do it anonymously.
Ransom-note style. You can. . .

05:35.877 --> 05:37.419
You know what?
l have a bunch of letters

05:37.503 --> 05:39.004
cut out of magazines
in my desk.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.088
You can use those.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.757
lf this were Russia,
yeah, sure,

05:41.841 --> 05:43.342
everybody would
go to one Santa,

05:43.426 --> 05:45.344
and there would be
a line around the block,

05:45.428 --> 05:46.678
and once
you sat on her lap

05:46.763 --> 05:47.846
and she asked you
what you wanted,

05:47.930 --> 05:50.307
you would say,
probably, freedom,

05:50.433 --> 05:54.019
at which point
the KGB would arrest you
and send you to Siberia.

05:54.103 --> 05:56.813
lt's a good thing
Russia doesn't exist anymore.

05:56.981 --> 05:57.981
DWlGHT: Name?

05:58.274 --> 05:59.274
Kelly.

06:00.109 --> 06:02.194
And what would you
like for Christmas?

06:02.278 --> 06:04.863
l would like
the photographer,
please, Santa.

06:04.947 --> 06:05.947
RYAN: We'll talk.

06:07.450 --> 06:10.410
So far, people really seem
to like the party this year.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.788
We took some chances
and it's working out.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.792
Ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho, ho!

06:17.251 --> 06:22.589
Why pay more
to sit next to old
Trannie Claus over there

06:22.673 --> 06:24.549
when you can sit
on my lap?

06:24.634 --> 06:29.221
Phyllis is only
pretending to be a man.
l'm the real thing !

06:29.639 --> 06:32.099
Sit down on my lap
and there will be no doubt!

06:32.183 --> 06:33.225
Okay.
Okay.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.852
No, it's not,
like, penis-wise.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.146
Hello, little boy!
What's your name?

06:38.523 --> 06:40.732
Michael, it's me, Kevin.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.734
Phyllis says
l'm too big for her lap.

06:42.819 --> 06:48.740
Oh, l am so sorry
that Phyllis hates you
and hates your body,

06:49.283 --> 06:51.618
but Santa
remembers a reindeer

06:51.702 --> 06:54.913
that was just a tiny
bit different as well.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.581
When can l sit
on your lap?

06:56.666 --> 06:59.334
Right now!
Come on over here, big boy!

07:00.545 --> 07:02.671
There we go!
Oh, my God.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.131
(GRUNTS)

07:04.215 --> 07:06.258
That's really
comfortable.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.345
What would you
like for Christmas,
little boy?

07:13.391 --> 07:16.726
l don't know.
l didn't know you
were gonna ask me that.

07:16.811 --> 07:19.187
Well, what did you think
was going to happen?

07:19.272 --> 07:23.233
l didn't know.
Nobody's ever let me
sit on their lap before.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.777
(SOFTLY) All right,
just say some toys, please.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.571
Can you give me
some choices?

07:27.822 --> 07:29.823
'Cause l really
don't want to mess up
on this list.

07:29.907 --> 07:31.867
Damn it, Kevin.
Come on.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.120
What about if l
tell you the things
l don't want?

07:35.204 --> 07:37.372
Okay, get off!
Get off! Off!

07:37.707 --> 07:38.707
(GROANS)

07:38.791 --> 07:40.750
Oh, God !

07:40.835 --> 07:42.752
l didn't even get to
tell you what l wanted.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.337
Okay, you know
what you get?

07:44.422 --> 07:46.715
You get a thousand
helium balloons
attached to you

07:46.799 --> 07:49.050
so Santa doesn't have
to go through this again.

07:49.635 --> 07:50.677
Awesome.

07:50.761 --> 07:51.761
Foot's asleep.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.222
Oh, God. My whole leg.

07:55.683 --> 07:59.269
Oh, God.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.236
All right, that's better.
Who's next?

08:08.905 --> 08:09.946
Well?

08:10.031 --> 08:11.698
l'm trying, Phyllis.
You're Santa.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.783
The only Santa.
That's what l want.

08:13.868 --> 08:17.245
You promised me this.
Don't make me
get Bob involved.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.914
What would Bob do?

08:18.998 --> 08:20.916
Never mind.
l shouldn't have said that.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.460
Check it out.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.838
ln fourth grade,
Bronwyn Reinhart stabbed me
with a pencil,

08:26.923 --> 08:27.923
scarred me for life.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.049
Oh !

08:29.509 --> 08:30.509
Oh, yeah, l see it.

08:30.593 --> 08:31.593
(CHUCKLES)

08:31.677 --> 08:33.303
Yeah, so l know
how it feels.

08:33.387 --> 08:34.596
Does it hurt?

08:34.680 --> 08:35.805
lt stings a lot.

08:36.682 --> 08:37.682
Hmm.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.852
l keep trying
to figure out who's
sending me these gifts.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.020
l know, right?

08:42.104 --> 08:44.022
So far no one
will admit to it.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.233
(CHUCKLES)
ls it you?

08:50.446 --> 08:51.571
Yeah !

08:54.283 --> 08:55.867
Totally.
l admit it. lt's me.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.202
(LAUGHS) Seriously?

08:57.870 --> 08:59.037
Seriously?

08:59.121 --> 09:01.998
Are you serious?
ls. . . What. . . ls it you?

09:02.792 --> 09:04.209
When you're. . .
l don't. . . Are you. . .

09:04.293 --> 09:05.377
Oh, no, no, no. l'm saying. . .
Are you asking. . .

09:05.461 --> 09:06.461
l'm saying, are. . .
l don't. . .

09:06.796 --> 09:08.547
lt's you. . . No. . .
ls it. . .

09:08.881 --> 09:13.385
Yeah. Totally serious.
l'm your Secret Santa.
Busted !

09:13.553 --> 09:14.636
(LAUGHS)

09:15.221 --> 09:16.638
There he is.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.056
Hey, man.
Hey.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.891
ls Matt around?
l've got his check.

09:20.476 --> 09:23.895
Matt is on a delivery.
Just leave it here.
l'll take it.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.231
l'll just wait for him.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.316
You'll wait?

09:29.151 --> 09:31.111
You're gonna wait to give
a guy you don't know
his check?

09:31.487 --> 09:32.904
Spirit of Christmas.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.573
Right. Christmas.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.450
Matt's a pretty
good-looking dude,
don't you think?

09:37.535 --> 09:39.911
l'll just leave
it here with you.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.496
All right,
thank you.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.334
Come here!
Come here! Come here!

09:46.460 --> 09:49.087
l'm doing
something over here.
Come on ! Ah !

09:49.171 --> 09:50.213
Ho! Ho! Ho!

09:50.298 --> 09:52.173
MlCHAEL: Come on,

an employee on your lap.

Do you understand?
You forced my hand.

Michael, it's Phyllis.
We want Phyllis as Santa.

Michael as Santa,

away from me, fine.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.554
The board

but to approve,

this office needed a Santa.

20:51.166 --> 20:56.295
And then it
needed a second Santa.
And then it needed a Jesus.

And now,

21:00.676 --> 21:02.426
it needs a Michael.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.313
Not great.
You heckled Santa
for an hour and a half.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.482
That was a different guy.
That was Jesus.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.859
Jesus sort of
ruined the party.

Hurt, petulant Jesus.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.989
Are you serious?
That is so offensive.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.200
You know what's
even more offensive,

21:26.285 --> 21:31.330
is bailing on this party
because some jerk ruined
the first part of it.

Not gonna happen.

keeps her job and
David Wallace does not.

held you guys

Yes, l will,

how to get through to him.
