WEBVTT

00:04.421 --> 00:06.797
Oh, that feels so good.

00:06.965 --> 00:10.843
Oh, lucky me.
Coffee and a live sex show.

00:11.136 --> 00:12.720
- I'm sorry, what?
- I'm sorry.

00:12.887 --> 00:16.473
- Nothing. I was just reading to Emma.
- From Cosmo?

00:18.518 --> 00:21.020
Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh:

00:21.187 --> 00:24.189
"Climax Your Way to Better Skin."

00:25.191 --> 00:28.485
So I have to go shopping today,
which is my least favorite thing.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.821
I'm so bad at picking out clothes.

00:30.989 --> 00:35.159
So you need someone who knows
fashion to, uh, tell you what looks good.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.369
Not me. Not me. Not me.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.289
- Oh, hey, Rach?
- Yeah?

00:40.915 --> 00:44.168
- Maybe you could take Charlie shopping?
- Oh, well...

00:44.335 --> 00:46.754
- I'm sure you have better things to do.
- You kidding?

00:46.921 --> 00:49.631
Rachel loves to shop,
and she has great taste.

00:49.799 --> 00:53.052
She's the one that taught me not
to wear white after Labor Day...

00:53.219 --> 00:57.723
...and to always, always, always put
on underwear when trying on clothes.

00:59.517 --> 01:02.227
If you have the time,
I'd really appreciate the help.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.646
Okay. Yeah, let's shop.

01:04.813 --> 01:09.401
Okay, you are gonna come back
with some very classy clothes. Ha-ha-ha.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.820
And some slutty lingerie. Slutty!

01:13.573 --> 01:16.575
Okay, great. All right, bye.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.827
Pain in the ass!

01:19.037 --> 01:22.748
- That's off, right?
- What's the matter, Pheebs?

01:22.916 --> 01:27.044
Ugh, Mike's sister just invited me to
a party tonight and he's gonna be there.

01:27.212 --> 01:31.757
She was like, "Don't worry. I asked him
and he's totally okay with seeing you."

01:31.925 --> 01:35.761
So now I have to go so he'll think
that I'm totally okay with seeing him.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.764
- You're not. You're hung up on him.
- Exactly.

01:38.932 --> 01:42.351
You want him to eat his heart out,
so you have to look fabulous.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.728
I didn't even think about that.

01:44.896 --> 01:47.689
Ugh. Sexual politics!

01:48.274 --> 01:51.026
Pheebs, I'm taking Charlie shopping.

01:51.194 --> 01:54.404
- Come and I'll help you find something.
- That'd be great.

01:54.572 --> 02:00.119
Oh, isn't that nice? The three of you,
trying on slutty lingerie together.

02:01.079 --> 02:05.499
- That's not what we're gonna do.
- Why'd you ruin it? Who was I hurting?

02:47.292 --> 02:51.920
Wow.
Fortunately, she has a very pretty face.

02:55.925 --> 03:01.680
I still can't believe this.
My uterus is an inhospitable environment?

03:01.848 --> 03:04.892
I've always tried so hard
to be a good hostess.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.895
I can't believe my sperm
have low motility.

03:08.062 --> 03:12.733
While I was growing up, they sure
seemed to be in a hurry to get places.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.610
- Hi there.
- Hi.

03:14.777 --> 03:17.863
I'm sorry there wasn't better news
from your tests last week...

03:18.031 --> 03:20.782
...but I wanted to talk to you
about your options.

03:20.950 --> 03:21.992
Okay.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.246
Even though your chances of conceiving
through natural means aren't great...

03:26.414 --> 03:29.124
...you never know,
so keep having sex on a regular basis.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.335
Oh, damn it!

03:32.837 --> 03:36.632
Don't worry.
After a while, you'll tune it out.

03:37.300 --> 03:41.136
Given your situation, the options
with the greatest chances for success...

03:41.304 --> 03:45.390
...would be surrogacy
or insemination using a sperm donor.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.310
Okay.

03:48.478 --> 03:52.773
If you feel that neither of those is
right for you, you could always adopt.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.608
Is that a hint?

03:54.776 --> 04:00.447
Because we love you, Dr. Connelly,
but we don't want you to be our child.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.746
Wow. Talk about
an inhospitable environment.

04:09.540 --> 04:13.377
Hi. Okay, you ready to go pick up
Phoebe and go shopping?

04:13.544 --> 04:16.630
- Let's do it.
- All right, have a good time.

04:17.130 --> 04:19.382
Not gonna find any clothes in there.

04:20.677 --> 04:21.927
- Hey, you guys.
- Hi.

04:22.095 --> 04:26.431
Guess who's up for keynote speaker
at the National Paleontology Conference?

04:26.641 --> 04:28.934
- Uh, Chris Bailey?
- Yeah, right.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.562
When was the last time he made
a submission deadline for an abstract?

04:37.610 --> 04:38.944
Why are you laughing?

04:39.112 --> 04:42.739
Just seeing what it'd be like
to be a paleontologist.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.533
It's fun. Yeah.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.369
- You're up for keynote speaker?
- Yeah.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.329
- Who's deciding?
- Professor Sherman.

04:49.497 --> 04:52.666
- I'm meeting with him today.
- He's a pretty tough guy to impress.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.294
I think I know how to dazzle him.

04:55.461 --> 04:59.423
Oh, you're not gonna to do
a magic trick, are you?

04:59.674 --> 05:01.133
Pfft. No.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.686
- Hey, guys.
- I want to ask you something.

05:12.854 --> 05:16.064
I may get to speak
at this paleontology convention.

05:16.232 --> 05:19.693
If I do, I'd love for you guys
to come and hear me.

05:19.861 --> 05:24.948
I think I can safely say that we all have
family issues, work and/or are sick.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.493
- It's in Barbados.
- But you come first.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.162
I'm there.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.414
- We'll see you guys.
- Bye.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.459
- See you.
- Hey.

05:36.294 --> 05:39.963
- So how did it go at the fertility clinic?
- Not as much fun as last time.

05:40.131 --> 05:43.592
Apparently, you only get porn
if you're giving a sperm sample.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.303
So, uh, what did the doctor say?

05:46.471 --> 05:50.182
There's surrogacy, but Monica's dreamt
her whole life of carrying a child...

05:50.350 --> 05:54.269
...and she just felt that watching
a surrogate would be too hard for her.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.646
- So you're ruling out surrogacy?
- Yeah.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.815
So I don't have to learn
what that means?

06:00.109 --> 06:03.070
Aside from adoption, the only
other choice is insemination...

06:03.237 --> 06:05.280
...so we're talking about sperm donors.

06:05.448 --> 06:09.159
Enough said. I'm there for you, man.
Where is she, upstairs?

06:11.579 --> 06:13.205
How do you feel about all this?

06:13.373 --> 06:18.377
I wish there was an easier way for us
to have a child, but there isn't one.

06:18.753 --> 06:22.339
Come on, Ross, be a good guy.
Step up and do it.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.508
What?

06:26.969 --> 06:30.013
What? No!
I'm not gonna give them Ben!

06:34.727 --> 06:39.272
The data we're receiving
from MRI scans and DNA testing...

06:39.440 --> 06:41.483
...of these fossils are staggering.

06:41.692 --> 06:42.734
Mm-hm.

06:42.902 --> 06:46.071
I mean, we've been accepting
Leakey's dates as a given.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.324
But if they're off
by even a 100,000 years or so...

06:49.492 --> 06:53.328
...then you can just throw
most of our assumptions...

06:53.496 --> 06:55.789
...you know, right in the trash.

06:55.957 --> 07:00.043
So, what I'm saying is...

07:00.294 --> 07:02.045
Is that...

07:02.338 --> 07:07.050
Is that, uh, repercussions could be huge.

07:07.218 --> 07:10.971
I mean, not just in paleontology,
but if you think about it...

07:11.139 --> 07:15.350
...in evolutionary biology,
uh genetics, uh, geology.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.145
I mean, truly, the mind boggles.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.651
Well, that's not what you want.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.200
- Incentive for Men?
- I'll take some of that.

07:32.368 --> 07:34.035
- That's for men.
- I know.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.829
When I go to the party later...

07:35.997 --> 07:40.000
...Mike will know I'm over him
because I'll smell like another guy.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.127
Yeah.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.336
Okay.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.007
Oh, good, I'm dating
a Russian cabdriver.

07:47.717 --> 07:51.428
Seriously, does anyone buy this?
I smell like beets.

07:53.639 --> 07:58.018
I really like those jackets with the
shoulder pads in them. Where are those?

07:58.186 --> 08:01.396
Um, on Melanie Griffith in Working Girl.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.275
Um, I think what you want is over here.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.278
See, I told you I needed someone.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.823
By the way, as a thank you,
I would really love to take you out.

08:11.991 --> 08:15.243
- Really?
- Joey and I are going to a movie tonight.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.662
- You want to come?
- Oh, I can't.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.832
Because I've seen them.

08:23.085 --> 08:25.545
You've seen all the movies?

08:25.713 --> 08:29.007
Yeah. I'm a big fan.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.634
Of the movies.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.928
You know, motion pictures.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.471
The talkies.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.892
Rach, will you come with me
to a dressing room?

08:39.059 --> 08:40.101
- Sure.
- Okay.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.187
Maybe we could do something else.

08:42.355 --> 08:46.816
You know, that depends on what it is.
I've done a lot of stuff.

08:55.701 --> 08:58.954
So, what were you doing out there?
Do you not like Charlie?

08:59.121 --> 09:03.083
She's okay. I don't know, I just don't
get a really good vibe from her.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.585
- Why?
- I don't know.

09:05.753 --> 09:10.882
You know, just the way
she waltzed in here all smart...

09:11.217 --> 09:12.717
...and tall, you know...

09:12.885 --> 09:16.388
...and just swept Joey off his feet.
Nobody else has a chance.

09:16.889 --> 09:17.931
Who else?

09:18.766 --> 09:19.808
Anybody.

09:20.893 --> 09:21.935
You.

09:22.728 --> 09:23.770
Me.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.273
You know, Monica's mom.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.236
- You like Joey?
- Shh! Phoebe!

09:31.404 --> 09:35.865
All right, look, I do.
I have a little thing for him. Just...

09:36.576 --> 09:38.660
- Oh, my God.
- It's just physical.

09:38.828 --> 09:43.290
I have it totally under control, okay?
It's just when I see them together...

09:43.457 --> 09:46.626
...sometimes, I just get a little jealous.

09:46.794 --> 09:50.463
Wow. Isn't that ironic
that he liked you, and now you like...?

09:50.631 --> 09:52.132
I get it!

09:53.384 --> 09:55.552
All right, as long as it's under control.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.763
You can't do anything about it.
He's already dating her.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.974
She is a nice person.
That wouldn't be right.

10:01.142 --> 10:04.102
I know, I know.
So it's just not a big deal.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.521
- So can we keep this between us?
- Sure.

10:06.689 --> 10:10.817
Great, because I gotta get out of here.
The smell of beets is killing me.

10:16.532 --> 10:19.909
- Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
- Mm.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.416
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.669
I brought a friend home for dinner.
This is Zack from work.

10:29.837 --> 10:33.131
Oh, of course. It's so nice
to see you again, Zack.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.967
- You too.
- You guys haven't actually met before.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.011
But, boy, you're both polite.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.180
Have a seat. I'll get you a beer.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.515
- I got it.
- Thanks.

10:45.186 --> 10:48.938
- So Zack's pretty nice, huh?
- Yeah, I guess.

10:49.565 --> 10:53.276
So how would you like to have a baby
that's half yours and half his?

10:57.239 --> 10:58.281
Excuse me?

10:58.449 --> 11:01.910
We're talking about sperm donors,
and Zack may be the guy.

11:02.078 --> 11:07.123
Look. He's intelligent, he's healthy,
he's athletic. I mean, he's sperm-tastic!

11:09.251 --> 11:13.046
Chandler, this is crazy.
Well, what did you even say to him?

11:13.214 --> 11:16.508
"Come up. Meet my wife.
Give us your sperm."

11:17.134 --> 11:20.387
I invited him to dinner so you'd get
a chance to get to know him.

11:20.554 --> 11:23.807
With a sperm bank, you never
meet the guy, get to check him out.

11:23.974 --> 11:26.393
- Chandler!
- I'm telling you, he's great.

11:26.560 --> 11:30.730
I mean, even if my sperm worked fine,
I think he'd be the way to go.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.192
I'm not going to be a part of this.

11:34.360 --> 11:38.697
You can't bring some random guy home
and expect him to be our sperm donor.

11:38.864 --> 11:39.906
Okay.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.576
- Zack?
- Thanks.

11:44.203 --> 11:47.122
Do you have a coaster?
I don't want to make a ring.

11:47.289 --> 11:49.457
Tell me about yourself, Zack.

11:54.088 --> 11:57.674
Oh, God, do you think she heard?
It'd be so bad if she heard.

11:57.842 --> 12:01.928
Maybe she didn't hear. I'll go into that
dressing room and talk. You stay here.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.055
- See if you can hear me.
- Okay, great.

12:06.976 --> 12:10.270
Oh, thank God,
I can't hear a word that you're saying.

12:10.438 --> 12:15.066
- I didn't say anything yet.
- Well, get back in there and talk.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.444
I'm Rachel.

12:17.611 --> 12:21.406
It's so annoying when I put Emma
on the phone to talk with my friends.

12:21.824 --> 12:22.866
What?

12:23.701 --> 12:26.494
Well, some things are just hard
to say to your face.

12:27.955 --> 12:32.000
Okay, well, I heard that.
Which means that she heard it too.

12:32.460 --> 12:36.129
- We have a problem.
- Oh, what are we gonna do?

12:36.297 --> 12:38.131
Just be honest with her.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.091
Oh, my God!

12:40.259 --> 12:42.594
It is annoying when parents
put babies on the phone.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.763
All right, enough out of you!

12:51.604 --> 12:55.315
- Hello?
- I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?

12:55.483 --> 12:58.318
No, she, uh, went shopping with Rachel.
Why? What's up?

12:58.486 --> 13:02.447
I'm meeting with Professor Sherman
about my being the keynote speaker.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.991
- How's it going?
- It could be better.

13:06.368 --> 13:09.287
He, um... He fell asleep.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.457
What? But I already bought
my ticket to Bermuda!

13:13.876 --> 13:16.669
- Barbados.
- Fine, I'll rent a car and drive.

13:18.380 --> 13:19.964
You have to get that job.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.425
What am I supposed to do?
He's out cold.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.303
In fact, he was just talking
in his sleep before...

13:25.471 --> 13:29.849
...and evidently he wants someone
named Fran to "spank him harder."

13:30.059 --> 13:33.311
- Well, just wake him up.
- I can't.

13:33.479 --> 13:37.857
If he realizes that I'm the one who
put him to sleep, I won't get the job.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.526
Ooh, that's a tough one.

13:39.693 --> 13:42.612
Oh, wait a minute.
This happened to me before.

13:42.780 --> 13:48.034
Yeah, I was auditioning for a play,
and the producer fell asleep. I...

13:48.202 --> 13:50.328
No, wait a minute.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.080
It was me who fell asleep.

13:52.957 --> 13:57.126
I mean, hey, Shakespeare, how about
a chase scene once in a while?

14:00.256 --> 14:03.800
- Hey, guys, dinner's ready.
- I'm gonna go wash up first.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.009
Thanks.

14:08.097 --> 14:12.851
What do you think? I want his genes for
my kid. Those eyes, those cheekbones.

14:13.269 --> 14:16.604
Okay, there's enthusiastic,
and there's just plain gay.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.900
- You don't like him.
- I think he's fine.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.319
But we don't know
anything real about him.

14:23.487 --> 14:27.824
- I wish we could get more information.
- All right, just follow my lead.

14:28.617 --> 14:32.161
- You guys have a great place here.
- Thanks. I'm crazy about our place.

14:32.329 --> 14:34.122
Hey, speaking of crazy...

14:35.749 --> 14:39.252
...do you have a history
of mental illness in the family?

14:40.004 --> 14:44.799
Uh, no. Although, I did have an uncle
who voted for Dukakis.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.386
That's really not the kind of thing
we're looking for.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.055
Okay.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.268
So, um, tell me, how'd you guys meet?

14:55.436 --> 14:58.730
Oh, friends first, drunk in London,
you know the story.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.607
I've got a better question for you:

15:01.108 --> 15:04.319
Do you or any of your blood relatives
have diabetes?

15:06.739 --> 15:07.780
No.

15:08.198 --> 15:11.784
Uh, heart disease? Alzheimer's? Gout?

15:14.079 --> 15:16.831
You guys don't have people
for dinner a lot, huh?

15:17.333 --> 15:19.375
We're just making conversation.

15:19.543 --> 15:23.004
Yeah, well, okay.
I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.924
You know what's not funny?
Male pattern baldness.

15:29.803 --> 15:33.306
You guys have shown a lot of interest
in me tonight, and I'm flattered...

15:33.474 --> 15:35.767
...and quite frankly, a little frightened.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.227
Can we just talk about something else?

15:38.395 --> 15:39.812
- Sure.
- All right.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.856
This ravioli's delicious.

15:42.066 --> 15:46.277
I notice you're enjoying that ravioli
with a beautiful set of teeth.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.321
Did you have braces as a child?

15:48.572 --> 15:50.949
- No, I didn't.
- Yes!

15:53.994 --> 15:56.496
We're teeth people, Zack.

16:01.502 --> 16:05.004
Let's just do it. Let's just go
over there and see if she heard.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.297
- Good plan.
- Okay.

16:07.341 --> 16:11.010
- What? Where are you going?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Rachel.

16:11.178 --> 16:14.514
I don't have time
for your childish games, okay?

16:14.682 --> 16:17.266
I still have to find something
incredible to wear...

16:17.434 --> 16:20.436
...so I can beat Mike
at "Who's More Over Who"!

16:25.442 --> 16:26.943
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.570
- Where have you been?
- Trying on clothes.

16:29.738 --> 16:34.575
Oh, really? In the dressing room?
Well, that's so weird.

16:34.743 --> 16:39.998
Phoebe and I were in the dressing room.
Gosh, it's just such a small world.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.709
Rachel, I heard you
two guys whispering.

16:42.876 --> 16:46.004
Oh, God, you did, you heard.
Okay, look, let me explain.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.172
There's nothing to explain.
I heard you.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.674
Phoebe likes Joey.

16:54.638 --> 16:55.680
Yeah.

16:57.766 --> 17:00.560
I don't understand it.
I mean, Phoebe likes Joey...

17:00.728 --> 17:03.688
...and then she's here to buy a dress
to impress another guy?

17:03.856 --> 17:08.651
Yeah, that's Phoebe. That's Phoebe.
You know, she just wants them all.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.695
It's, like, she's nympho.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.531
- Wow!
- Yeah.

17:14.700 --> 17:18.536
You know, by the way, I heard you
tell her not to do anything.

17:18.704 --> 17:23.040
Thanks for sticking up for me.
God, you are such a nice person.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.417
I try.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.745
Oh!

18:03.415 --> 18:08.503
Oh, my God, you really want me
to be the keynote speaker?

18:09.338 --> 18:11.130
Thank you!

18:13.383 --> 18:15.093
You're welcome.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.774
Wow! You look...

18:30.692 --> 18:32.944
...stop-eating hot!

18:34.530 --> 18:37.240
Which is like the highest level
of hotness.

18:37.407 --> 18:41.744
Okay, are you sure? Because I am
really dreading going to this party.

18:41.912 --> 18:42.954
Then don't go.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.874
Mike knows I'm coming. If I don't show
up, he'll think it's because of him...

18:47.042 --> 18:51.838
...and then I'm gonna lose face.
That's a very serious thing in my culture.

18:52.881 --> 18:57.468
All right, then you go to that party,
and you pretend to be over Mike.

18:57.636 --> 19:01.180
Afterward, you come to my place
and I'll get you good and drunk.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.099
You got it. Okay.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.810
But not on the wine
that you made, okay?

19:05.978 --> 19:09.897
Because I just don't want to go back
to the emergency room.

19:19.449 --> 19:20.950
David?

19:21.118 --> 19:22.702
Phoebe! Hi.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.288
- Oh, my God!
- Hi.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.291
Wow! You look unbelievable.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.209
Oh, yeah, well...

19:32.462 --> 19:33.838
What are you doing here?

19:34.006 --> 19:36.966
Well, I'm back from Minsk.
Uh, permanently.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.342
Well, what happened?

19:38.510 --> 19:40.344
Remember how I was trying
to achieve...

19:40.512 --> 19:43.389
...the positronic distillation
of subatomic particles?

19:43.557 --> 19:45.016
Yeah.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.728
Well, after eight years of research,
I discovered...

19:48.896 --> 19:51.397
...that it can't be done.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.274
Well...

19:54.067 --> 19:56.777
...great that you're back. How are you?

19:56.945 --> 19:58.821
- Good. Good. Life is good.
- Good.

19:58.989 --> 20:02.825
- Well, I'm seeing someone.
- Oh.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.577
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

20:04.745 --> 20:09.123
She's also a scientist,
so she's very smart and pretty and, um...

20:09.291 --> 20:11.751
It's actually because of you
that we're together.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.795
I mean, I saw what you had
with that Mike guy...

20:14.963 --> 20:17.048
...and I just said, "Boy, I want that."

20:17.674 --> 20:20.551
- Mike and I broke up.
- You're kidding me.

20:20.719 --> 20:24.847
Because I'm not seeing anybody.
I just totally made that up.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.058
- Really?
- I don't know why, I'm sorry.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.852
I guess I just didn't want
to lose face.

20:30.145 --> 20:32.271
I understand.

20:32.689 --> 20:35.858
Yeah. Okay. So then, okay...

20:36.026 --> 20:39.946
So we're both living in New York,
not seeing anyone.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.365
- That's so not like us.
- Yeah, I know.

20:42.532 --> 20:47.078
Well, this is probably a stupid question,
seeing that you look like that...

20:47.246 --> 20:50.122
...but, um, do you have someplace
that you need to be right now?

20:50.290 --> 20:51.332
Well...

20:52.626 --> 20:53.668
No.

20:55.545 --> 20:58.589
- Well, do you want to get a drink?
- I'd love to.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.716
- Great.
- Okay.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.721
Uh, do you smell beets?

21:05.889 --> 21:08.641
Oh, all right, stay upwind of me.

21:10.852 --> 21:14.605
Hey, there's Phoebe.
Is that Mike she's with?

21:15.148 --> 21:17.316
No, that's David.

21:17.484 --> 21:20.236
There's a third guy?

21:20.696 --> 21:23.906
Tip of the iceberg.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.202
I'm gonna take off now.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.913
You're gonna let me go home,
aren't you?

21:31.373 --> 21:33.457
Sure you don't want to stay
a little longer?

21:33.625 --> 21:35.751
No, I should get home.
I'm kind of tired.

21:35.919 --> 21:37.628
Are you always tired?

21:37.796 --> 21:40.673
Because that could be
a sign of clinical depression.

21:41.341 --> 21:45.136
No, it's tiring to figure out the age
at which all my grandparents died.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.098
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.308
Bye.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.936
I think we found our sperm.

21:54.938 --> 21:56.480
He does seem pretty perfect.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.025
Yeah? You think so?
Should I ask him?

22:01.695 --> 22:02.737
No.

22:02.904 --> 22:05.531
Why not? Just because his
great-grandmother was obese?

22:05.699 --> 22:08.367
Our kid's gonna get that
from you anyway.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.705
No, that's not it.

22:12.873 --> 22:17.335
It's just that when we were asking him
all those questions before...

22:17.502 --> 22:22.423
...I just realized I don't care if he
is the most perfect guy in the world.

22:22.591 --> 22:26.260
- He's not you.
- Yeah, he's better!

22:27.888 --> 22:30.097
No, he's not.

22:30.265 --> 22:34.602
If I can't get pregnant with you,
then I don't want to get pregnant by him...

22:34.770 --> 22:36.354
...or anyone else.

22:37.731 --> 22:41.233
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.819
Thank God, because I
don't wanna do this either.

22:43.987 --> 22:47.198
I was just doing it because I thought
that was what you wanted.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.951
I'm the husband.
I'm supposed to bring the sperm.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.704
That is so sweet.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.956
I love you.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.712
So you know this leaves us with...

23:02.464 --> 23:03.506
Adoption.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.217
How do you feel about that?

23:07.677 --> 23:10.304
I think I feel okay about it.

23:10.680 --> 23:14.141
Actually, I think I feel
really good about it.

23:15.268 --> 23:16.310
Me too.

23:16.895 --> 23:21.232
I wanna find a baby that needs a home,
and I wanna raise it with you.

23:21.400 --> 23:25.111
And I wanna mess it up
in our own specific way.

23:26.780 --> 23:30.157
So this is it?
We're really gonna adopt?

23:30.951 --> 23:31.992
Yeah.

23:32.702 --> 23:36.997
- Oh, my God! We're gonna be parents!
- We are gonna be great parents.

23:37.165 --> 23:38.416
And it could be soon.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.752
I mean, think about it.
Right now, somewhere out there...

23:42.170 --> 23:44.588
...our baby could be being conceived.

23:44.756 --> 23:49.301
Wait. If we're lucky,
and we're really, really, really quiet...

23:49.469 --> 23:53.139
...we may be able to hear
the sound of a condom breaking.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.062
Hey, Zack.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.398
Hey, Chandler.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.400
I wanted to apologize for last night.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.944
I got the feeling
we made you uncomfortable.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.279
- No, you didn't.
- Really?

24:08.447 --> 24:10.156
No, you did.

24:10.323 --> 24:12.992
My wife and I have
some boundary issues.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.286
Sometimes we ask
inappropriate questions.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.037
We're working on it.

24:17.205 --> 24:20.541
- Here are the boards for Friday's pitch.
- Thank you.

24:22.794 --> 24:26.505
You wouldn't know if she's planning
on keeping her baby, would you?
