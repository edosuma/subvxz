WEBVTT

00:42.843 --> 00:46.047
It's
December 9th, 2022.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.017
I'm Dr. Steve Unger.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.955
Here, we have
patient number one,

00:55.123 --> 00:59.393
female, mid-20s to late 20s,

01:02.096 --> 01:04.030
no vital signs.

01:04.032 --> 01:05.233
Cause of death...

01:08.102 --> 01:09.037
Strangulation.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.874
I will administer
five milliliters

01:15.876 --> 01:17.511
of test batch alpha,

01:18.779 --> 01:21.349
the results of which
should yield...

01:25.286 --> 01:26.752
Life.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.182
Please.

01:55.916 --> 01:56.951
Let this one.

03:27.975 --> 03:28.976
She's alive!

04:44.118 --> 04:46.852
It's such a beautiful place.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.625
Wow, look at that!

04:53.594 --> 04:55.963
That moth is so amazing.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.201
The moth's a great mimic.

05:02.203 --> 05:03.835
To hide from predators, the moth

05:03.837 --> 05:05.906
can evolve to look like insects,

05:07.074 --> 05:11.245
such as a wasp or,
even the tarantula.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.981
Okay, are you telling me that

05:15.983 --> 05:17.385
can turn into a tarantula?

05:18.686 --> 05:20.388
Yes.

05:21.389 --> 05:22.354
Hey, look it up in the Internet

05:22.356 --> 05:23.557
if you don't believe me.

05:25.626 --> 05:26.794
So gross,

05:27.928 --> 05:28.996
yet oddly beautiful.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.200
What if people
were like moths,

05:34.202 --> 05:37.305
and this body of ours
was only the beginning?

05:39.973 --> 05:40.941
What do you mean?

05:44.144 --> 05:44.978
Okay.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.647
Well, before it becomes a moth,

05:48.649 --> 05:51.317
a caterpillar has this
transformative cells

05:51.319 --> 05:52.520
hidden within its body.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.756
And once it enters the cocoon,

05:56.924 --> 05:59.491
those transformative
cells are released

05:59.493 --> 06:03.495
and they can become whatever
it needs to survive.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.630
Who knows?

06:04.632 --> 06:07.333
Maybe we have those same

06:07.335 --> 06:10.168
transformative cells within us.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.973
And all we need to
do is wake them up,

06:14.174 --> 06:17.243
then we can turn into
some strange creature.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.084
But I think, I think I'm,

06:26.086 --> 06:27.953
I think I'm turning
into one now.

06:27.955 --> 06:31.559
I'm uh, uh, uh.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.527
What?

06:35.529 --> 06:37.931
I'm coming for
you now, Darlene.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.001
Coming for you, Darlene.

07:16.970 --> 07:17.803
Oh!

07:22.376 --> 07:23.210
Darlene,

07:24.478 --> 07:26.144
I have loved you

07:26.146 --> 07:28.181
since the first moment
I've ever saw you.

07:31.485 --> 07:34.152
I'm no poet but
this is as romantic

07:34.154 --> 07:35.756
as I thought it was in my head.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.595
You've been so patient
with me after med school.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.264
You stood by my side when

07:45.466 --> 07:47.635
I couldn't even stand
to be by myself.

07:49.437 --> 07:52.938
I can't imagine spending
the rest of my life

07:52.940 --> 07:54.375
with anyone else but you.

07:56.344 --> 07:58.045
I promise to love you,

07:59.913 --> 08:00.848
cherish you,

08:02.450 --> 08:03.451
support you,

08:05.519 --> 08:06.454
and care for you.

08:07.488 --> 08:10.290
I will absolutely treasure you

08:12.560 --> 08:17.565
forever and ever if you
promise to marry me.

08:22.870 --> 08:26.340
Darlene, will you marry me?

08:30.944 --> 08:33.645
Yes, of course.

09:16.424 --> 09:17.556
Are there any side effects

09:17.558 --> 09:19.425
that we should know about?

09:19.427 --> 09:20.561
She'll be tired.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.997
The pain medication will
help with the headaches.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.235
The shot I'll administer
will help with the nausea.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.472
You'll feel a
little pinch, okay?

09:37.277 --> 09:39.478
As a hospice nurse,

09:39.480 --> 09:42.015
I'm here not only for your wife,

09:42.983 --> 09:44.783
but your entire family

09:44.785 --> 09:46.420
till the last
stages of her life.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.691
You mentioned you have
a daughter, correct?

09:54.194 --> 09:54.995
Lily.

09:56.497 --> 09:57.297
Lily.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.500
That's a beautiful name.

10:01.502 --> 10:02.335
Thank you.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.704
I'll help you and Lily

10:05.706 --> 10:07.074
get through this process.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.775
I'll make sure your wife

10:09.777 --> 10:11.445
is as comfortable as possible.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.516
Now, I've laid
out some pamphlets

10:16.917 --> 10:20.020
that detail everything from
symptoms to be aware of,

10:21.288 --> 10:23.524
as well as coping
with family stress.

10:24.792 --> 10:28.259
Are there any other
family members

10:28.261 --> 10:30.631
that should be present
for these conversations?

10:31.799 --> 10:34.101
Her parents passed
away a while ago.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.037
She has a brother,

10:38.338 --> 10:40.974
but he is not much into family.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.076
No worries.

10:44.177 --> 10:47.481
What about your occupation?

10:50.217 --> 10:53.485
I do research for
a cosmetics lab,

10:53.487 --> 10:56.557
so my hours are pretty
much nine to five.

11:03.564 --> 11:05.497
Just know
I'm here to help,

11:05.499 --> 11:08.802
for as little or
as much possible.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.311
It will help you
and your daughter

11:20.313 --> 11:21.580
in this situation.

11:21.582 --> 11:24.282
There's no timetable
when we can pinpoint

11:24.284 --> 11:28.453
when your wife will slip
into a coma or pass.

11:28.455 --> 11:31.623
It can be weeks, months,

11:31.625 --> 11:34.194
so the sooner you address
these things, the better.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.931
Do you have any
questions so far?

11:40.934 --> 11:41.735
No.

11:44.538 --> 11:47.407
But thank you, for
everything, Betty.

11:55.883 --> 11:59.019
I promised to always
take care of you.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.724
You are, more than enough.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.025
Could've done something more

12:07.027 --> 12:08.428
to prevent all this.

12:12.532 --> 12:15.202
None of this is because
you failed at something.

12:20.641 --> 12:23.143
I'm lucky to have married you.

12:24.978 --> 12:29.983
From this home, and life,
to our beautiful daughter,

12:32.653 --> 12:34.285
I'm blessed.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.253
Mom!

12:35.255 --> 12:36.089
Dad?

12:37.224 --> 12:38.091
Speaking of.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.661
In here, sweetie.

12:41.695 --> 12:43.061
What are you all doing?

12:43.063 --> 12:44.497
It isn't bedtime.

12:45.565 --> 12:48.066
Of course not, sweetie.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.736
Mommy is just a
little tired today.

12:50.738 --> 12:52.270
You're always tired, mommy.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.607
That's nothing new.

12:55.743 --> 12:56.908
Hey, why don't you tell us

12:56.910 --> 12:59.177
what you did in school today?

12:59.179 --> 13:00.347
Stars.

13:02.015 --> 13:02.883
Stars?

13:04.217 --> 13:06.451
What about the stars?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.854
There are bi-gillion,
million of stars in the sky

13:08.856 --> 13:11.089
and the sun is a big star.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.724
That's right.

13:12.726 --> 13:13.560
Good job.

13:15.395 --> 13:18.630
Can we look at
the stars tonight?

13:18.632 --> 13:21.733
We'll need to let
mommy take a nap.

13:21.735 --> 13:25.070
And then, we can look
at the stars later.

13:25.072 --> 13:25.906
Okay?

13:29.076 --> 13:30.477
Sweet dreams, mommy.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.286
Hey, kiddo.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.154
How would you feel about

13:43.156 --> 13:44.923
two of us taking a trip?

13:44.925 --> 13:46.057
Just us two.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.027
Where?

13:48.729 --> 13:51.362
- Where do you want?
- New Mexico.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.798
It's odd.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.132
Why New Mexico?

13:54.134 --> 13:55.834
My teacher's from
there and she said

13:55.836 --> 13:58.038
you can see tons of stars.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.842
All right then, New Mexico.

14:02.710 --> 14:04.511
How come mommy wanna come?

14:09.750 --> 14:12.450
Well, mommy is
not gonna be able

14:12.452 --> 14:14.753
to do everything with us.

14:14.755 --> 14:16.990
Sometimes, it's just
gonna be you and me.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.427
How do you feel about that?

14:22.429 --> 14:23.396
About what?

14:25.032 --> 14:26.433
If it was just you and me.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.602
My friend at
school has two dads.

14:31.071 --> 14:34.072
Okay, but I don't think
you'll gonna another dad,

14:34.074 --> 14:39.079
but what about a dad and a mom?

14:40.113 --> 14:42.182
No, that would be weird.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.052
Yeah.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.485
Come on.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.287
Let's go wake up mom
for dinner, okay?

15:23.723 --> 15:24.990
Okay, here.

15:24.992 --> 15:27.425
Put this on, it's a
little cold outside.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.295
Where's mom?

15:29.296 --> 15:31.997
Mom is still asleep.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.464
Still?

15:33.466 --> 15:34.534
Lazy mom.

15:35.969 --> 15:39.838
Your mom needs a lot of
sleep these days, okay?

15:39.840 --> 15:43.074
- Okay.
- All right.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.111
Go get your backpack.

15:49.883 --> 15:51.384
And this must be Lily.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.888
Lily, this is Betty.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.555
She's gonna make
mommy feel better

15:57.557 --> 15:58.859
when we're away from home.

15:59.827 --> 16:01.028
Nice to meet you, Lily.

16:02.195 --> 16:03.962
Are you gonna help my
mom with her headaches

16:03.964 --> 16:05.799
and from getting
tired all the time?

16:06.967 --> 16:08.168
Well, I'm gonna try.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.070
We'll see, okay?

16:11.471 --> 16:12.670
You're off to school?

16:12.672 --> 16:14.572
Yeah, my
dad walks me everyday

16:14.574 --> 16:16.441
before he goes to work.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.243
Well, that's nice of him.

16:18.245 --> 16:19.544
Such a good daddy he is.

16:19.546 --> 16:22.313
Hm, I think, yes, he's okay.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.550
Hey!

16:25.552 --> 16:27.485
Darlene's inside asleep.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.254
You have the code to get in?

16:29.256 --> 16:30.488
I do.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.957
Well, you have a good day,

16:31.959 --> 16:35.060
and maybe, after
school, I'll meet you

16:35.062 --> 16:37.097
with some freshly baked cookies.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.200
- I like her.
- Mm-hm.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.801
Come on, all right.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.071
Bye, thanks, Betty.

16:56.616 --> 16:57.450
Steve.

17:00.053 --> 17:00.854
Amigo.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.462
Are you all right?

17:12.598 --> 17:13.733
Let me show you this.

17:21.608 --> 17:22.775
Steve, this...

17:24.211 --> 17:25.278
This looks promising.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.613
Are these using the
stem cell samples

17:28.615 --> 17:29.616
we got in yesterday?

17:32.252 --> 17:33.184
I tried a different approach

17:33.186 --> 17:35.053
from our previous attempts.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.793
I definitely see a lot
of cell regeneration there.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.433
But I think we should
show it to Dr. Berry.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.073
You used the neural
stem cell samples

17:55.075 --> 17:56.709
we received from St. Louis?

17:58.045 --> 17:59.577
Yes, sir.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.513
Just the neural?

18:03.216 --> 18:05.352
Well, actually,

18:06.653 --> 18:08.956
I added embryonic cells as well.

18:14.027 --> 18:14.861
Robert,

18:18.298 --> 18:19.332
let me talk to Steve,

18:21.268 --> 18:22.102
alone.

18:31.311 --> 18:35.981
Where the fuck did you
get the embryonic cells?

18:35.983 --> 18:38.416
We received the package
from St. Louis that contained

18:38.418 --> 18:41.186
both the neural and the
embryonic stem cells.

18:41.188 --> 18:42.553
So, you just up and decided

18:42.555 --> 18:44.958
to research with them
without my approval?

18:46.093 --> 18:47.194
You like having a job?

18:48.561 --> 18:49.396
Making money?

18:52.399 --> 18:54.165
I don't know where you're
planning to go with this.

18:54.167 --> 18:57.802
Stop wasting my fucking
time trying to play savior,

18:57.804 --> 18:59.637
by creating cures for diseases

18:59.639 --> 19:01.208
we have no business treating.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.742
I make money to run this place,

19:04.744 --> 19:07.778
pay you a salary by
developing cosmetic therapies

19:07.780 --> 19:09.514
to sell to the rich
people in America,

19:09.516 --> 19:12.150
who have the money to
pay for these treatments.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.419
Yeah, and we can
continue to do that.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.287
But we could also develop

19:16.289 --> 19:18.889
groundbreaking treatments
for lots of diseases.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.360
We have the capacity.

19:21.561 --> 19:24.262
You develop a
cure for, let's say,

19:24.264 --> 19:27.265
something small, chicken pox.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.733
Great!

19:28.735 --> 19:30.835
No kid in America ever
catches the disease again

19:30.837 --> 19:32.172
and it becomes obsolete.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.875
Guess who needs to buy
your medication now.

19:36.909 --> 19:37.744
Nobody.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.445
And how much do you make

19:40.447 --> 19:42.582
when nobody needs
your medication?

19:44.484 --> 19:45.985
Not a goddamn cent.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.756
There is never going to
be a cure for cellulite

19:51.758 --> 19:53.460
as long as people enjoy eating.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.661
The goddamn Russian scientists
are testing on humans

19:56.663 --> 19:58.029
and making a killing.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.330
It's all I wanna do here,

19:59.332 --> 20:00.867
and make you and I some money.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.835
Focus on the task I give you

20:04.837 --> 20:06.306
and you keep your job.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.576
Yes, sir.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.680
Think of your daughter.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.764
So, what did he say?

20:34.033 --> 20:34.867
Nothing.

20:36.336 --> 20:39.139
Just wants me to keep making
plastic faces for rich people.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.742
Look, Steve, I'm with you.

20:44.177 --> 20:46.779
Yeah, I wish our jobs were
more rewarding than they are.

20:49.048 --> 20:50.450
But it's a job, man.

20:51.684 --> 20:52.852
I'm sorry about Darlene.

20:54.221 --> 20:55.955
I pray for your
family every night.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.059
But it truly is in
God's hands, my friend.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.565
You know one thing
he said that was right?

21:06.899 --> 21:08.399
As long as people keep
getting rich off medications,

21:08.401 --> 21:10.670
then there's no
incentive to find a cure.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.671
They'll say, "Keep
the sick medicated,

21:13.673 --> 21:15.408
"keep the profits rolling then."

21:16.609 --> 21:18.843
Something there's got
to change, all right?

21:18.845 --> 21:22.215
Our health care system,
they're robbing us blind.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.550
We're just getting
played by the system.

21:25.552 --> 21:28.085
I mean, as scientist,
it's our responsibility

21:28.087 --> 21:29.654
to find a fix.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.290
If we don't, then
nothing will ever change.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.725
I agree but there are rules,

21:34.727 --> 21:36.261
morals that we have to abide by,

21:36.263 --> 21:38.296
and if we don't, then
we're no different.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.132
Are we?

21:42.469 --> 21:44.337
Hey, I'll keep praying
for both of us.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.274
And give Darlene my best, huh?

23:04.751 --> 23:07.585
It's 90 degrees
outside and it's December,

23:07.587 --> 23:10.054
and they tell us global
warming isn't real.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.290
I know this is
Texas but come on.

23:12.292 --> 23:14.959
Well, moving on to
something that is real,

23:14.961 --> 23:17.495
did you hear about
this strange story?

23:17.497 --> 23:19.964
An eight-year-old
boy bitten by a wasp

23:19.966 --> 23:22.867
while vacationing with
his parents in Costa Rica

23:22.869 --> 23:25.069
returned home deathly sick,

23:25.071 --> 23:28.339
but within a few days,
recovered from his illness,

23:28.341 --> 23:31.609
and miraculously cured
from a lifelong battle

23:31.611 --> 23:34.178
of his multiple
sclerosis disease.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.513
Isn't that amazing?

23:35.515 --> 23:38.716
However, weeks after
his stunning recovery,

23:38.718 --> 23:42.653
the boy slipped into a
coma and eventually died.

23:42.655 --> 23:45.923
Doctors are still puzzled
about his miraculous recovery

23:45.925 --> 23:47.625
and are trying to understand

23:47.627 --> 23:49.894
more about the boy's illness.

23:49.896 --> 23:52.397
They've sent cell
sample to various labs

23:52.399 --> 23:53.631
- across the state...
- Sorry.

23:53.633 --> 23:54.899
For
further research

23:54.901 --> 23:56.901
in the hopes to learn
more and possibly find...

23:56.903 --> 23:58.403
- Sorry.
- A cure for MS.

23:58.405 --> 24:00.907
Have a nice day.

24:04.577 --> 24:05.412
Daddy!

24:07.980 --> 24:08.815
He-hey!

24:09.982 --> 24:10.781
How's my little one?

24:10.783 --> 24:13.386
- Good.
- Good.

24:14.621 --> 24:18.022
Uh, oh, what's going on in here?

24:18.024 --> 24:20.558
Well, good
evening, Mr. Unger.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.192
Just Steve is fine.

24:22.194 --> 24:23.630
Good evening, Steve.

24:24.731 --> 24:25.565
Hey.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.534
Hey, how are you feeling?

24:29.536 --> 24:31.001
Good.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.671
Betty just waited a
bit until you got home.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.706
She cooked dinner for us.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.475
Oh, that was nice.

24:37.477 --> 24:38.709
Thank you, Betty.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.445
It's no problem at all.

24:40.447 --> 24:44.214
I even made Miss Lily some
homemade mac and cheese.

24:44.216 --> 24:45.516
Yummy, right?

24:45.518 --> 24:48.218
A lot better than that
bug stuff you make, dad.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.219
No offense.

24:49.221 --> 24:51.391
- Oh.
- Oh, no offense, huh?

24:52.792 --> 24:54.827
The things they teach
kids in school these days.

24:56.629 --> 24:58.295
Well, I better get going.

24:58.297 --> 25:00.264
You guys enjoy the dinner.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.067
Bye, Lily.

25:02.268 --> 25:04.769
Hey, Betty, why
don't you stay?

25:04.771 --> 25:07.805
That is, unless you
have other dinner plans.

25:07.807 --> 25:10.510
I can't say this single
woman has any plans.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.913
So, Lily, do you mind if I stay?

25:22.589 --> 25:24.056
Do you have kids, Betty?

25:25.358 --> 25:27.124
No, I don't.

25:27.126 --> 25:27.960
Why?

25:29.662 --> 25:33.099
God didn't bless
me with the ability to.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.066
Why would God do that?

25:36.068 --> 25:38.969
Lily, it's not nice to ask
personal questions like that.

25:38.971 --> 25:40.640
No, it's okay.

25:43.376 --> 25:46.110
God has a
plan for all of us.

25:46.112 --> 25:50.216
And we all play a role
in each other's lives.

25:51.618 --> 25:56.086
And besides, I'm here to help
with you and your family.

25:56.088 --> 25:59.490
Help us make yummy mac
and cheese and cookies?

25:59.492 --> 26:00.791
Exactly.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.439
So, what have you discovered?

29:36.308 --> 29:37.143
A fix.

29:49.288 --> 29:52.191
No, no, this isn't right.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.664
Wait, wait,
what isn't right about it?

29:59.465 --> 30:01.932
You're tampering
with human DNA here.

30:01.934 --> 30:04.401
I mean, you're
regenerating cells faster

30:04.403 --> 30:06.305
than anything I've
ever seen possible.

30:07.306 --> 30:08.540
How did you even do this?

30:10.076 --> 30:12.542
You remember those cell
samples we got from St. Louis?

30:12.544 --> 30:14.747
Yeah, the ones you
showed me the other day.

30:16.282 --> 30:18.015
Yeah, well, those
samples contained the cells

30:18.017 --> 30:20.584
of an eight-year-old boy
who died from a disease

30:20.586 --> 30:23.022
contracted from a wasp
bite in Costa Rica.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.757
But before he died,
that same disease

30:26.759 --> 30:29.559
cured his multiple sclerosis.

30:29.561 --> 30:30.995
Right, so there's
something there

30:30.997 --> 30:32.429
that we could tap into.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.233
I am close to getting it.

30:36.703 --> 30:38.237
This is dangerous stuff, man.

30:39.405 --> 30:41.371
Yo don't know what
this can do long-term.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.741
We don't even do that
kind of research here.

30:43.743 --> 30:45.175
But we have them now, okay?

30:45.177 --> 30:46.846
We could something
of this, okay?

30:49.982 --> 30:51.749
We run a test.

30:51.751 --> 30:55.119
We inject the virus and
follow it up with this serum.

30:55.121 --> 30:59.623
And we could come very
close to finding a cure.

30:59.625 --> 31:00.492
A cure for what?

31:02.795 --> 31:03.763
For anything.

31:05.131 --> 31:06.098
Everything.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.601
Can you even imagine
what that would be like?

31:12.571 --> 31:13.804
I know why you're doing this.

31:13.806 --> 31:15.405
Okay, I get it.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.474
But even if you did go
through with any of this,

31:17.476 --> 31:19.710
this would never pass
through any FDA regulations.

31:19.712 --> 31:21.447
Who or how would you even test?

31:22.882 --> 31:25.615
We don't even have
that authority here.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.384
I mean, look at these mutations

31:27.386 --> 31:29.088
that are occurring
in this sample.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.957
You can't fathom
the consequences

31:32.959 --> 31:34.493
that could result from testing.

31:38.497 --> 31:40.330
Walk away from this.

32:02.789 --> 32:07.226
I'm really sorry I missed
your dance recital, Lily.

32:13.632 --> 32:16.202
I've been working really
hard to make mommy better.

32:17.669 --> 32:19.906
And you do want mommy to
get better, don't you?

32:27.013 --> 32:30.714
You know, Betty, I really
can't thank you enough

32:30.716 --> 32:33.183
for everything that you've been

32:33.185 --> 32:35.254
doing around here,
all your help.

32:37.023 --> 32:38.555
I can't even imagine what life

32:38.557 --> 32:40.126
would be like here without you.

32:42.061 --> 32:43.495
You're welcome.

32:53.505 --> 32:56.273
Did you all eat dinner?

32:56.275 --> 32:57.676
Yeah, we did.

33:00.079 --> 33:00.878
Are you hungry?

33:00.880 --> 33:01.948
Mm, no.

33:03.850 --> 33:05.651
No, just tired.

33:08.187 --> 33:11.623
This medication
makes me so sleepy.

33:19.331 --> 33:22.967
Sorry for
being mad at you.

33:22.969 --> 33:24.935
Are you mad at me?

33:24.937 --> 33:26.939
- Before.
- When?

33:28.107 --> 33:30.674
Forgetting me at
dance rehearsal.

33:30.676 --> 33:31.510
Hey.

33:32.945 --> 33:35.347
I didn't forget about you.

33:36.582 --> 33:37.516
I was just late.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.117
I know.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.819
I need to be more tough and
not such a baby anymore.

33:42.821 --> 33:46.058
I know mom is sick and we
need to be tough for her.

33:48.427 --> 33:51.297
I made this for you to
protect us from being sick.

33:52.498 --> 33:53.832
You promise to wear it?

33:55.801 --> 33:57.937
I'll never take it off.

34:02.008 --> 34:03.373
Good night, sweetheart.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.144
Sweet dreams, daddy.

34:24.596 --> 34:25.931
Earth to Steve.

34:30.369 --> 34:31.203
Hey, beautiful.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.313
Did your work allow you to

34:44.315 --> 34:46.418
take all this equipment
home with you?

34:48.187 --> 34:51.456
I think borrow would be
a better word than take.

35:03.669 --> 35:06.436
So what are you so
obsessed with out here

35:06.438 --> 35:09.339
that I don't see you as much?

35:09.341 --> 35:11.377
I've had a breakthrough
in my research.

35:12.678 --> 35:15.081
I just need to dedicate
more time to it.

35:16.348 --> 35:20.119
Look, I promise, I'm
going to fix you.

35:22.021 --> 35:23.787
I'm so close...

35:23.789 --> 35:24.955
- Steve.
- To finally finding...

35:24.957 --> 35:26.290
Steve!

35:26.292 --> 35:28.892
Steve, all I want
is you and Lily

35:28.894 --> 35:32.231
to spend whatever
time is left, with me.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.835
It's too away for
any of this, Steve.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.503
No.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.840
I'll make more time.

35:43.075 --> 35:45.377
Look, all I have to
do is perfect it.

35:46.979 --> 35:47.813
And it might...

35:48.981 --> 35:52.484
No, it will cure you.

35:53.919 --> 35:54.920
I just have to hurry

35:56.388 --> 35:58.991
because I won't lose you.

36:01.893 --> 36:06.530
Okay,
I understand that,

36:06.532 --> 36:09.866
that this is your way of
dealing with the situation,

36:09.868 --> 36:10.936
to fix it.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.273
But I don't you to fix me.

36:16.575 --> 36:19.609
I need you to just
lay down with me

36:19.611 --> 36:22.281
and accept this, together,

36:24.583 --> 36:28.054
'cause I'm trying to keep
it together.

36:29.988 --> 36:31.123
I'm scared.

36:33.892 --> 36:37.329
I'm scared of not
leaving a perfect home.

36:40.499 --> 36:43.069
I'm scared of,

36:44.703 --> 36:47.106
I'm scared of Lily
growing up with anger.

36:50.209 --> 36:51.475
I'm scared of you being lonely

36:51.477 --> 36:52.778
for the rest of your life.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.748
But also of not remembering me

36:58.750 --> 36:59.985
if you do move on.

37:01.087 --> 37:03.755
No.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.256
No.

37:06.258 --> 37:08.325
No, that's not gonna happen.

37:08.327 --> 37:10.496
No, it's not gonna happen.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.330
You wanna know why?

37:13.332 --> 37:16.402
Because you are
not going anywhere.

37:17.836 --> 37:22.272
You're gonna stay right
here with me, forever.

37:22.274 --> 37:23.075
All right?

37:24.543 --> 37:26.712
- I love you.
- I love you.

38:39.518 --> 38:42.721
Today is December 6, 2022.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.922
I'm Dr. Steven Unger,

38:45.924 --> 38:48.794
and today I will proceed
with the first test

38:49.995 --> 38:54.700
of batch alpha on
subject A, mouse.

38:56.768 --> 39:00.672
Subject A is free of
ailment and disease,

39:01.840 --> 39:04.843
so I will administer
a lethal virus,

39:05.977 --> 39:07.811
and upon death,
will then administer

39:07.813 --> 39:11.815
two milliliters of
test batch alpha,

39:11.817 --> 39:14.851
the results of
which should return

39:14.853 --> 39:16.922
subject A back to life.

40:02.801 --> 40:04.970
Subject A is now deceased.

40:08.173 --> 40:12.642
So, I'll administer two
milliliters test batch alpha.

41:07.833 --> 41:08.667
My god.

41:18.109 --> 41:21.480
After two-milliliter
dosage of test batch alpha,

41:24.249 --> 41:28.952
subject A has returned to life.

41:32.458 --> 41:36.027
All bodily functions
appear normal.

41:54.480 --> 41:56.980
Dad, it's mom!

41:56.982 --> 41:57.783
Dad!

42:00.486 --> 42:01.953
Dad, help, please!

42:04.990 --> 42:07.092
Dad, mom needs help, quick!

42:07.993 --> 42:12.998
Dad!

42:16.868 --> 42:18.267
What's going on?

42:18.269 --> 42:21.204
Daddy, what's going on?

42:21.206 --> 42:23.208
Daddy, please answer me.

42:24.510 --> 42:25.809
Daddy!

42:25.811 --> 42:28.111
- Go wait in the living room.
- Daddy.

45:43.875 --> 45:46.843
What
are you, crazy fucker?

45:46.845 --> 45:49.679
Why are you fucking
with me like that?

45:49.681 --> 45:52.716
You try that shit again,
I'll kick some ass.

47:03.822 --> 47:06.892
I'll be okay, if
you could fix her.

47:13.231 --> 47:14.733
For a long as you can fix her.

47:54.105 --> 47:58.107
I've always hated the
name my mom gave me.

47:58.109 --> 47:59.976
Minerva.

47:59.978 --> 48:01.947
I mean, what is that?

48:03.248 --> 48:04.716
But my mom, the
hippie ,

48:06.017 --> 48:08.885
so, it was just like
her to name someone

48:08.887 --> 48:10.453
something so a lot.

48:10.455 --> 48:12.621
That's why people
call me Minnie,

48:12.623 --> 48:13.624
because I'm so tiny.

48:16.294 --> 48:19.062
But, I mean, I think I'm
starting to like it a little bit.

48:19.064 --> 48:24.002
I looked it up and it
means goddess of wisdom.

48:25.336 --> 48:27.136
That's not too bad, right?

48:27.138 --> 48:27.973
It's kinda cool.

48:31.542 --> 48:32.543
So...

48:35.446 --> 48:38.049
Are you gonna kiss me, or what?

48:50.428 --> 48:51.429
I'm sorry.

49:24.195 --> 49:25.530
Shh, shh, shh.

49:30.969 --> 49:34.303
Shh, shh, shh.

49:34.305 --> 49:35.839
Quiet!

49:35.841 --> 49:37.073
Shh, shh.

49:37.075 --> 49:40.243
Quiet!

49:40.245 --> 49:41.510
Let's get to the car.

49:41.512 --> 49:42.347
Hurry!

49:48.619 --> 49:49.454
Shut up!

51:25.516 --> 51:26.950
No, no, no no.

51:26.952 --> 51:29.718
No, no, no, no, no, wake up.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.122
Come on, wake up.

51:31.957 --> 51:33.556
Wake up, wake up, don't.

51:33.558 --> 51:34.991
No, no, no.

51:34.993 --> 51:36.094
No, don't go.

52:21.639 --> 52:22.473
Damn!

53:03.581 --> 53:05.916
What are you doing, daddy?

53:08.453 --> 53:10.153
Get out of here, Lily.

53:10.155 --> 53:12.190
This isn't a place
to be playing around.

53:35.146 --> 53:38.414
You need some help with that?

53:38.416 --> 53:40.116
No, thanks.

53:40.118 --> 53:41.719
I'm just taking
out some old trash.

53:43.454 --> 53:44.687
Well, Lily came in crying.

53:44.689 --> 53:46.591
I just want to see if
everything was okay.

53:47.525 --> 53:49.358
Everything is okay.

53:49.360 --> 53:50.195
I'm good.

53:52.430 --> 53:53.731
That looks really heavy.

53:55.233 --> 53:56.865
Yes.

53:56.867 --> 53:57.668
I'm good.

54:00.205 --> 54:01.939
You should probably
go inside and,

54:03.941 --> 54:05.343
see if Lily needs any help.

56:19.610 --> 56:20.778
- Steve.
- What?

56:23.714 --> 56:24.549
Oh, sorry.

56:26.217 --> 56:27.716
Did I wake you?

56:32.890 --> 56:34.357
Kiss me.

56:43.501 --> 56:44.335
Kiss.

56:48.005 --> 56:48.839
Kiss me.

56:50.675 --> 56:52.176
Kiss me right now.

56:54.779 --> 56:55.613
Kiss me.

56:56.447 --> 56:57.282
Kiss me.

56:58.549 --> 56:59.384
Kiss me.

57:53.471 --> 57:54.705
You look tired.

58:00.177 --> 58:04.480
I'm not defeated.

58:04.482 --> 58:07.151
Now that's what I'm afraid of.

58:09.420 --> 58:10.855
Come lay with me.

58:33.778 --> 58:36.779
Promise me that whatever
it is you're doing,

58:36.781 --> 58:39.884
it won't jeopardize
everything we've built so far.

58:45.222 --> 58:46.223
I promise.

58:58.736 --> 58:59.870
How you feeling, kiddo?

59:10.214 --> 59:11.749
Don't lose this one.

59:12.950 --> 59:14.485
Yes, sorry.

59:15.686 --> 59:17.488
I must have misplaced
the other one.

59:18.689 --> 59:21.524
I promise to take good
care of this one, okay?

01:00:19.183 --> 01:00:21.018
I can't keep
letting you do this.

01:00:26.857 --> 01:00:28.726
You can't play God.

01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:35.631
What are you gonna do?

01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:36.501
Report me?

01:00:39.003 --> 01:00:40.302
Listen.

01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:44.807
As a friend, I know
you're hurting, man.

01:00:44.809 --> 01:00:46.074
You're trying everything

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:47.375
that you can do
to help, but you...

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:51.446
Hey, you have no idea
what I am going through,

01:00:51.448 --> 01:00:53.949
okay, because you do not
have the urgency that I have

01:00:53.951 --> 01:00:56.485
as a husband, as a father,
who'll do anything he can

01:00:56.487 --> 01:00:57.653
to keep his family together.

01:00:57.655 --> 01:00:59.054
Not this way.

01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:00.656
Whatever you're doing
is not controlled.

01:01:00.658 --> 01:01:01.592
It's not regulated.

01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:05.127
I have to stop you.

01:01:08.533 --> 01:01:11.736
Stay out of it or
you're gonna get hurt.

01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:20.175
Stay out of it.

01:01:46.236 --> 01:01:49.271
Police investigating
a missing person case

01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:51.640
are asking for
the public's help.

01:01:51.642 --> 01:01:53.609
The woman seen in this video,

01:01:53.611 --> 01:01:56.211
28-year-old Minerva Wilson,

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:58.413
was last seen walking
out of the bar

01:01:58.415 --> 01:02:00.683
with this unidentified man.

01:02:00.685 --> 01:02:02.885
Police are asking
for the public's help

01:02:02.887 --> 01:02:04.720
on identifying this man,

01:02:04.722 --> 01:02:07.191
or the whereabouts
of Minerva Wilson.

01:02:35.385 --> 01:02:36.220
Steve?

01:02:39.456 --> 01:02:40.557
Are you in there?

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:47.998
I'm going home for the evening.

01:02:50.768 --> 01:02:52.970
Call me if you need me, okay?

01:04:28.498 --> 01:04:29.399
Steve?

01:04:32.703 --> 01:04:34.571
Yeah, I'm here.

01:04:41.645 --> 01:04:44.146
You should really get some rest.

01:04:44.148 --> 01:04:49.153
I know, I'm just, really
haven't seen you very much.

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:52.389
I know.

01:04:53.791 --> 01:04:58.428
Just promise me that
when things get closer,

01:04:59.596 --> 01:05:02.132
you'll just lay down
with me more, please.

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:06.470
Hey.

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:10.808
There's gonna be plenty
of time for that later.

01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.943
I promise.

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:15.880
All right?

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:59.623
Betty.

01:06:04.061 --> 01:06:07.229
Come on, Betty.

01:06:07.231 --> 01:06:08.065
Come on.

01:06:12.602 --> 01:06:13.768
Okay.

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:14.604
Okay.

01:09:15.952 --> 01:09:17.019
Dad?

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:18.252
Are you in there?

01:09:18.255 --> 01:09:19.089
Hello?

01:09:27.064 --> 01:09:28.665
Who's in there, daddy?

01:09:29.933 --> 01:09:30.867
Nothing, sweetie.

01:09:32.102 --> 01:09:34.368
I've just got some
work in there.

01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:35.670
I've got some
dangerous equipment

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:38.073
that I don't want you to touch.

01:09:38.075 --> 01:09:41.011
So don't ever go in there, okay?

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:42.746
Okay.

01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:46.381
Promise me, Lily.

01:09:46.383 --> 01:09:48.118
Never go in there.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:50.187
I promise.

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.555
Good.

01:09:53.557 --> 01:09:56.460
All right, let's
get you to school.

01:11:25.115 --> 01:11:26.983
It's
fascinating, isn't it?

01:11:36.893 --> 01:11:38.295
What have you done, Steve?

01:11:39.529 --> 01:11:41.131
You know how they
got the flu shot?

01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:48.605
Neurologists in Michigan
in the early 40s

01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:52.540
deliberately infected patients

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:54.911
at the mental hospital
with the influenza virus.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.846
You know, there was
some trouble in there

01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:00.450
and dozens of death.

01:12:02.085 --> 01:12:02.919
Viola!

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:04.921
Got a vaccine.

01:12:08.124 --> 01:12:09.393
You know, I'm this close.

01:12:11.127 --> 01:12:14.829
This close

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:17.401
to developing something
that will change the world.

01:12:18.602 --> 01:12:20.568
And people will look
back at all of this

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:23.205
and say that it was necessary

01:12:23.207 --> 01:12:26.243
to advance health, science,

01:12:27.377 --> 01:12:31.615
and sacrifices the
few to save the many.

01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:37.521
There'll be some
casualties along the way.

01:12:39.155 --> 01:12:40.422
But they are just as much a part

01:12:40.424 --> 01:12:43.126
of this discovery as I am.

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:47.464
You see that now?

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:52.702
The work I'd do will save lives,

01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:56.640
keep families together.

01:12:57.674 --> 01:12:59.543
It will end suffering.

01:13:01.445 --> 01:13:03.112
And you don't think
she's suffering?

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:08.552
She...

01:13:12.956 --> 01:13:15.825
She promised to help me

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:19.160
any way that she could.

01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:21.798
She is helping me.

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:24.668
She's helping my family!

01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:28.171
She's helping your family.

01:13:29.306 --> 01:13:32.509
She is helping millions
of others out there.

01:13:36.813 --> 01:13:37.814
I'll pray for you.

01:13:41.418 --> 01:13:43.420
Well, save your prayer!

01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:27.061
Welcome back to the
land of the living.

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:28.197
How are you feeling?

01:14:31.335 --> 01:14:33.036
I'm truly dying to know.

01:14:41.545 --> 01:14:45.246
You know, I always told
that I would succeed.

01:14:45.248 --> 01:14:48.550
You could have been
here, right alongside me,

01:14:48.552 --> 01:14:49.686
changing the world.

01:14:52.088 --> 01:14:54.190
It's too bad that you
won't get to see it.

01:15:11.608 --> 01:15:13.309
Sorry, you had to
see that, Betty.

01:15:14.878 --> 01:15:15.912
Really, I am.

01:15:18.882 --> 01:15:19.883
But don't worry.

01:15:21.651 --> 01:15:23.186
You won't suffer the same fate.

01:15:24.988 --> 01:15:26.721
I promise.

01:18:24.333 --> 01:18:25.769
Thank you, honey.

01:18:31.541 --> 01:18:32.375
Where's Betty?

01:18:34.978 --> 01:18:35.912
I sent her home.

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:40.183
We don't need nurses anymore.

01:18:43.553 --> 01:18:44.387
What's wrong?

01:18:45.722 --> 01:18:49.458
I don't know what.

01:18:51.961 --> 01:18:53.029
Betty's gone.

01:18:56.432 --> 01:18:58.802
I don't know what you're doing.

01:19:01.738 --> 01:19:03.106
I don't know where Lily is.

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:04.908
Hey.

01:19:06.309 --> 01:19:08.845
Honey, it's okay.

01:19:10.046 --> 01:19:12.649
Lily is in the other
room having dinner.

01:19:14.684 --> 01:19:16.319
Everything hurts.

01:19:18.554 --> 01:19:19.889
Hey, hey, hey.

01:19:21.825 --> 01:19:23.259
This time next week,

01:19:24.594 --> 01:19:25.762
we're gonna be dancing.

01:19:47.651 --> 01:19:52.155
Test subjects shows no
further signs of development.

01:19:56.359 --> 01:19:57.293
No pupils.

01:19:59.595 --> 01:20:01.698
Body motions still irregular.

01:20:02.699 --> 01:20:03.833
Agitated.

01:20:06.269 --> 01:20:08.670
No vocal capabilities.

01:20:08.672 --> 01:20:12.175
Still no signs of basic
human communication.

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:17.211
I'll continue study
for two more days.

01:20:17.213 --> 01:20:18.982
If no further development,

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:25.321
I will terminate test subject.

01:22:47.897 --> 01:22:49.997
What are they doing?

01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:55.271
Are those security cameras?

01:25:34.497 --> 01:25:35.331
Lily!

01:26:26.782 --> 01:26:27.616
Lily.

01:26:47.636 --> 01:26:50.071
No, no, no, no, no.

01:26:50.073 --> 01:26:50.906
No.

01:26:53.809 --> 01:26:54.975
Oh, baby.

01:26:54.977 --> 01:26:55.811
Baby.

01:27:04.387 --> 01:27:05.388
Oh, sweetie.

01:27:33.849 --> 01:27:35.216
Okay, come on.

01:27:35.218 --> 01:27:36.150
Come on, baby.

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:32.873
The police.

01:28:32.875 --> 01:28:33.740
Open up!

01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:08.511
Ma'am?

01:29:09.545 --> 01:29:10.379
You're okay?

01:29:15.518 --> 01:29:18.319
What in the world.

01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:16.805
Mom?

01:31:24.079 --> 01:31:24.913
Mom?
