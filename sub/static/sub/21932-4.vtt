02:34.822 --> 02:37.723
First, we need to perfect
refrigeration techniques

extracted from the male

By "fluid", you mean--

02:42.830 --> 02:45.931
A centrifuge would
then sort particles according

And then finally,

12:12.933 --> 12:15.333
was far below normal levels.
And blood plaque

12:15.335 --> 12:17.368
is a chief factor in blood clotting.

12:17.370 --> 12:20.305
She wasn't a haemophiliac,
but any responsible surgeon

12:20.307 --> 12:23.174
would have refused
to put her under the knife.

12:23.176 --> 12:26.144
Haemophiliac?! Impossible!

12:26.146 --> 12:29.114
Not haemophilia,
but with blood nearly as weak.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.082
Impossible. Impossible.

12:31.084 --> 12:34.285
I examined Mrs. Sheen's blood
myself this past Tuesday.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.354
Every result was as expected.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.356
Perhaps you saw the results that enabled you

12:38.358 --> 12:42.293
to proceed with the operation.
Why would I need to?

12:42.295 --> 12:45.563
Do you have any idea
how many people in this world

12:45.565 --> 12:47.699
are nearing death
from a failing of the kidneys?

12:47.701 --> 12:50.668
Hundreds, thousands,
perhaps millions.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.371
I'm afraid I can't simply take your word for it,

12:53.373 --> 12:55.406
Dr. Lennox.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.042
I still have the vial.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.478
Of Mrs. Sheen's blood?
Indeed.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.148
In my refrigerated chest.
It's labelled "Sheen",

13:03.150 --> 13:05.150
possibly with an initial.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.218
I'll wait right here if you like.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.220
I will be proved correct.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.289
♪

13:13.359 --> 13:15.293
He's right.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.395
The plaque is normal.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.397
So the patient's blood was healthy

13:19.399 --> 13:22.834
only days before the operation.
Unless Dr. Lennox is lying

13:22.836 --> 13:25.937
to us and this isn't
actually her blood.

13:25.939 --> 13:28.206
So he could get away with killing her

13:28.208 --> 13:31.676
on a public stage?
That makes no sense.

13:31.678 --> 13:34.245
There's no other explanation
for the discrepancy.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.247
Unless he's correct

13:36.249 --> 13:39.684
and someone did indeed
sabotage his operation.

13:39.686 --> 13:42.253
By sabotaging
the patient herself.

13:50.229 --> 13:52.163
(people laug♪

13:52.165 --> 13:54.499
All we know is the patient
had normal blood plaque one day

13:54.501 --> 13:57.101
but not the next. And usually,
this kind of problem

13:57.103 --> 13:59.170
is caused
by hereditary factors

13:59.172 --> 14:01.139
or problems
with the thyroid.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.241
It would seem
someone did this intentionally;

14:03.243 --> 14:06.377
we simply don't know how.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.613
Where's bloody Watts?

14:08.615 --> 14:11.282
He asked for a couple
of days off, sir.

14:11.284 --> 14:14.452
Thinks he can wander in and out of this
station house and do as he pleases.

14:16.622 --> 14:18.957
Sir, our case?

14:18.959 --> 14:21.759
Hmm? Oh, yes. Right

14:21.761 --> 14:24.229
So the question is,
who wanted to see her dead?

14:24.231 --> 14:26.664
Or who wanted to discredit
the surgeon?

14:26.666 --> 14:29.634
That's mad.
There was a man in the crowd

14:29.636 --> 14:31.569
who called him a "butcher",

14:31.571 --> 14:33.571
but we have no leads
on identifying him.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.807
I'm willing to bet
that someone wanted

your wife was murdered.

We don't know,

foul play was involved.

It was people from the Church.

The ones who protested
at that operation.

16:27.620 --> 16:31.622
What do they call themselves?
The Christian Scientists.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.358
<i>Therefore, metaphysics</i>

16:33.360 --> 16:36.494
resolves things
into thoughts and exchanges

16:36.496 --> 16:39.530
the objects of sense
for ideas of Soul.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.532
The testimony
of the material senses

16:41.534 --> 16:44.102
is neither absolute
nor divine.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.337
Human philosophy has made

16:46.339 --> 16:49.007
God manlike.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.309
Christian Science makes

16:51.311 --> 16:53.511
man Godlike.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.882

Did you enjoy
what you heard of my sermon?

17:22.208 --> 17:24.709
I can't say I followed much of it.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.045
Many of the congregates here in Canada

17:27.047 --> 17:29.047
need a little extra help
with their science.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.549
And you are?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.184
Mary Baker Eddy
of course.

I'm so glad that you're
interested in our Church.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.423
Mr. Gable, would you find some
literature for these young men?

17:38.425 --> 17:41.392
Certainly.
We're not here to discuss

17:41.394 --> 17:44.095
your teachings per se.
Well...

17:44.097 --> 17:46.731
(Murdoch clearing his throat)
No.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.901
We were told that some
of the members of your Church

17:49.903 --> 17:53.204
visited Mrs. Sheen prior
to her transplant operation.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.473
Well, such an operation defies our belief

17:55.475 --> 17:58.009
that a medical procedure of any kind

17:58.011 --> 18:00.845
is an assault upon the body.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.614
Who exactly visited her?

18:03.616 --> 18:05.683
Myself and a couple of others,
Danvers and Lamotte, but--

18:05.685 --> 18:08.419
Yes, but no member
of our congregation would ever

18:08.421 --> 18:11.122
wish harm upon another soul.
Now if you'll excuse me,

18:11.124 --> 18:13.791
I'm very tired.
Good day, gentlemen.

18:15.194 --> 18:18.196
Uh, Mr. Gable,
we'll need a word.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.665
Are the men
that you mentioned here today?

18:20.667 --> 18:22.767
Yes, but as I was
trying to say,

18:22.769 --> 18:25.436
we never spoke to Mrs. Sheen,
only her husband.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.306
Well, he said she was
quite distraught.
Well, she was,

18:28.308 --> 18:31.576
but it wasn't us who upset her.
Her husband excoriated us

18:31.578 --> 18:33.578
and sent us away
before we had a chance

18:33.580 --> 18:37.048
to explain that the man speaking
to his wife was not
one of our number.

18:37.050 --> 18:40.485
There was someone already
there when you arrived?
Mhm.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.487
Can you describe him?
Dark hair,

18:42.489 --> 18:44.422
middle-aged.

18:44.424 --> 18:47.558
Serious man, scowling, severe.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.560
I saw him again at the surgery.

18:49.562 --> 18:52.363
He was the one who called
Dr. Lennox a butcher.

18:54.299 --> 18:57.068
Vitality and health in a
bottle. All the necessary amines

18:57.070 --> 18:59.203
from your food
distilled into a single pill.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.172
Thank you.
(indistinct chatter)

19:04.543 --> 19:06.711
I see you know
what you're talking about.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.414
Of course.
I only mean

19:10.416 --> 19:12.416
most people selling remedies
don't know a thing

19:12.418 --> 19:15.286
about modern medicine.
Are you a doctor?

19:15.288 --> 19:17.688
I'm at a medical
exposition, aren't I?

19:17.690 --> 19:20.491
That doesn't answer the question.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.660
How do you know so much about amines?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.629
I can read.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.631
You know, you can
learn a lot that way.

19:26.633 --> 19:30.001
So you're self-taught.
It's impressive.

19:30.003 --> 19:33.037
That served me well enough.
Would you like to try
a vitalamine?

19:33.039 --> 19:35.439
I think you might find it
quite rejuvenating.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.278
Where did you get this?
There's a blood booth

19:40.280 --> 19:43.080
around the corner. You just have
to be able to read the signs.

19:44.983 --> 19:47.785
Blood coagulation is my speciality.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.555
That's my brand new pamphlet
on the very topic.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.557
I wonder if you know

19:52.559 --> 19:54.559
of any substance
foreign to the body

19:54.561 --> 19:56.727
that inhibits coagulation?
Certainly.

19:56.729 --> 20:00.331
There are a few,
though it's a rather new topic.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.434
In particular, I'm curious
about what might affect

20:03.436 --> 20:06.070
blood plaque.
I can think of only one thing.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.539
Acetylsalicylic acid,

20:08.541 --> 20:10.474
better known as aspirin.

20:10.476 --> 20:12.910
Aspirin?
The pain-relief pills?

20:12.912 --> 20:15.146
Indeed. I only recently discovered

20:15.148 --> 20:17.315
the side effect while testing
some of my own blood

20:17.317 --> 20:19.984
in the wake of a nasty ache
in the head.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.420
How well known is this?
Not very.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.555
You won't find it in the pamphlet,

20:24.557 --> 20:26.691
but anyone who's visited
my booth could know.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.759
I have been crowing about it all week.

20:30.662 --> 20:33.364
Dr. Lennox's heckler may be
of more interest in this case

20:33.366 --> 20:36.567
than we'd first thought.
But you don't have his name.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.071
No. George is having a sketch
made up from his description.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.073
What is it you think he did?

20:42.075 --> 20:44.041
He went around
to this woman's house

20:44.043 --> 20:46.444
the day before her operation
and somehow made

20:46.446 --> 20:48.713
her blood not work?
I may have an answer.

20:48.715 --> 20:51.816
Aspirin.
Aspirin? The pills?

20:51.818 --> 20:54.785
A little-known side effect
inhibits blood plaque.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.922
I tested the victim's blood and
found it in high concentration.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.857
Maybe she was in pain.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.859
I re-examined the body

21:01.861 --> 21:04.061
and found an injection mark
on the back of the upper arm.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.564
Only gas was used
during the surgery.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.066
So someone stuck her with a needle.

21:09.068 --> 21:12.536
I believe so. Between 12
and 24 hours before she died.

21:12.538 --> 21:15.406
Precisely during
the time frame that our
mystery man was seen with her.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.875
Also, the side effect
is a recent discovery.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.611
The killer may well have
learned of it at the exposition.

21:21.947 --> 21:25.082
We need to know
if this man visited your booth

21:25.084 --> 21:27.051
earlier this week.
He certainly did.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.587
That's Dr. Ridgeway.
He's a doctor?

21:29.589 --> 21:32.456
A surgeon in fact.
He works in transplants,

21:32.458 --> 21:34.692
though I believe he has mostly
experimented with animals.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.794
And you spoke with him
about aspirin?

21:36.796 --> 21:39.964
At length. He took
a keen interest in my findings.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.233
Do you know where we might be
able to find him?

21:42.235 --> 21:44.735
I know he's in Toronto
specifically for the exposition.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.737
I assume he's staying at one of the hotels.

21:46.739 --> 21:50.174
Dr. Anton Ridgeway.
Thank you, Doctor.

21:50.176 --> 21:53.744
Thank you.
<i>Good people,</i>

21:53.746 --> 21:56.714
may I have your attention.
I have excellent news.

21:56.716 --> 22:00.785
After the most unfortunate
outcome of yesterday's surgery,

22:00.787 --> 22:04.322
so barbarically sabotaged
by outside forces,

a second attempt.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.468

22:17.470 --> 22:19.403

22:19.405 --> 22:21.439
There he is. That's Ridgeway.

22:24.876 --> 22:26.944
You're a madman!
Stop!

22:26.946 --> 22:29.347
(dramatic music)
Drop it!

22:29.349 --> 22:31.882
Drop it!
You are no doctor.

22:31.884 --> 22:34.452
Go back to your goats!

22:34.454 --> 22:37.722
Dr. Ridgeway,
you are under arrest.

He's a murderer.

and she became upset.

23:19.799 --> 23:22.233
It was for her own good.

That monster was planning
to slaughter her in front

he went ahead and did just that.

your shift ended hours ago.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.205

34:40.913 --> 34:42.679
The Inspector said every pair

34:42.681 --> 34:44.880
John, it's true
that your father

34:44.882 --> 34:46.882
is hard on everybody,

34:46.885 --> 34:49.518
but, I mean,
this... this goes beyond.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.655

34:51.657 --> 34:54.091
Doesn't matter to me, though.
I'll show him I can take it.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.560

on becoming a policeman?

34:58.564 --> 35:00.864
Well, it's the most
honourable job I know.

35:00.866 --> 35:04.267
Constable Brackenreid,
how's it going with those boots?

35:04.269 --> 35:06.269
I've shined nearly every pair
in the Station House, sir.

35:06.271 --> 35:09.339
Fine.
Will I be on patrol tomorrow?

35:09.341 --> 35:11.441
We'll see.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.510
You can finish the boots
tomorrow morning.

35:13.512 --> 35:16.680
Uh, you can take
the streetcar home.

35:16.682 --> 35:19.583
Thank you, sir.

35:19.585 --> 35:21.485
Listen,
a few of the lads and I

35:21.487 --> 35:23.453
are gonna go out for a drink,
why don't you come with us?

35:23.455 --> 35:25.388
Really? Yes, sir,
I'd like to.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.958
Excellent. And you don't call
me sir. We're both constables.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.960
More importantly,
answer me this:

35:29.962 --> 35:32.929
if I took the brain of a cat
and put it into a dog,

35:32.931 --> 35:36.466
would I have a cat or a dog?
A dog.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.502
See, that's what
these two said.

35:38.504 --> 35:41.838
But you're not considering.
If-if-if the soul resides

35:41.840 --> 35:44.141
in the mind, and the mind
isn't the brain...

35:44.143 --> 35:47.711
then surely, in essence,
you're still a cat.

35:47.713 --> 35:49.646
(small chuckle)

35:53.751 --> 35:56.720
(Murdoch): Do you think him
a megalomaniac?

35:56.722 --> 35:59.222
(sighing): That's likely.

35:59.224 --> 36:02.726
Then he could be
a psychopathic personality.

36:02.728 --> 36:05.195
Most doctors are megalomaniacs,

36:05.197 --> 36:07.430
particularly surgeons.

36:07.432 --> 36:11.601
It's seen by young men to be
a career filled with glory.

36:11.603 --> 36:14.604
There's no glory
in failed transplants.

36:14.606 --> 36:16.773
And a maniacal killer
wouldn't kill

36:16.775 --> 36:18.775
the first victim
and save the second.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.778
That makes no sense.
He was awfully lucky.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.480
Lennox?

36:23.482 --> 36:25.348
No, the second patient.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.584
How so?
Think of it.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.653
All of the millions of people who have died

36:29.655 --> 36:32.022
of kidney failure throughout history;

36:32.024 --> 36:34.958
what are the chances he comes
along at the precise moment

36:34.960 --> 36:37.827
to be the first person ever
to get a new one?

36:39.463 --> 36:42.265
That is lucky.

36:42.267 --> 36:44.601
And doubly so
given that he was never intended

36:44.603 --> 36:47.103
to receive the transplant
in the first place.

36:47.105 --> 36:50.173
He would have died
if it wasn't for a murder.

36:50.175 --> 36:52.542
Perhaps he made his own luck.

36:53.844 --> 36:56.413
Really, Detective, he can't be
speaking to anyone right now.

36:56.415 --> 36:59.382
His condition is that dire?
The surgery was a success,

36:59.384 --> 37:02.719
that is a doubtless fact, but
his body will need time to heal.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.721
How confident are you that he will?

37:04.723 --> 37:06.790
(sighing)

37:06.792 --> 37:08.792
I don't know.

37:08.794 --> 37:10.894
So it's possible
he may not recover.

37:12.630 --> 37:15.565
The kidney is not yet
functioning. If it doesn't,

37:15.567 --> 37:17.801
it is unlikely
his condition will improve.

37:17.803 --> 37:20.337
If he passes
before I can speak with him,

37:20.339 --> 37:23.173
I may never learn the truth
about Mrs. Sheen's murder.

37:23.175 --> 37:26.643
No, he couldn't have done it.
Why do you say that?

37:26.645 --> 37:28.645
I know what you're insinuating,

37:28.647 --> 37:30.647
but that poor man
has been ill for months.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.782
How exactly do you suppose
he murdered someone?

37:32.784 --> 37:34.884
Mrs. Sheen died
from an injection

37:34.886 --> 37:37.387
that was administered
the day before the surgery.

37:37.389 --> 37:39.389
It takes no strength at all
to use a syringe.

you say? There you have it.

37:47.532 --> 37:51.101
I'm not so sure.

37:51.103 --> 37:53.603
But how could he have done it
if he never left his bed?

37:53.605 --> 37:55.605
