01:55.480 --> 01:59.080
Hey, Curt, you guys gonna have
a little bash your last night in town?

01:59.160 --> 02:00.560
Moose has been
lookin' for you all day.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.400
He got worried. Thought you were
tryin' to avoid him.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.120
What do you got?

02:06.200 --> 02:10.600
- Oh, great.
- That's $2,000, man. $2,000!

02:10.680 --> 02:14.000
Mr.Jennings gave it to me
to give to you. He's sorry it's late.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.400
It's the first scholarship
the Moose Lodge has given out.

02:16.520 --> 02:19.800
He says they're all very proud of you
back at the lodge.

02:19.880 --> 02:23.040
- Why don't you hold it for me?
- I don't want it. Take it. It's yours.

02:23.120 --> 02:24.320
I'll take it.

02:26.720 --> 02:29.360
Listen, your sister calls.
I'll talk to you later.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.000
- Wait a second. She can wait.
- Make it short and sweet, huh?

02:32.080 --> 02:36.240
Listen, I don't think
I'm gonna be going tomorrow.

02:37.880 --> 02:40.080
Come on.
What are you talking about?

02:40.200 --> 02:44.840
I was thinkin' I could wait a year,
go to City for a while.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.800
You chicken fink.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.760
After all we went through
to get accepted?

02:49.520 --> 02:51.400
We're gettin' out of
this turkey town...

02:51.440 --> 02:55.120
and now you wanna crawl
back into your cell?

02:57.600 --> 03:00.520
You wanna end up like John?
You just can't stay 17 forever.

03:00.600 --> 03:04.400
- Get that through your head!
- I just need some time.

03:04.440 --> 03:07.520
I gotta go talk to Laurie.
Now take it. Take it!

03:07.600 --> 03:09.720
We're leaving in the morning,
all right?

03:10.720 --> 03:13.200
We're leaving
in the morning!

03:20.680 --> 03:24.400
We gonna rock and roll ourselves
to death, baby!

03:24.440 --> 03:26.800
You got the Wolfman Jack Show!

04:01.800 --> 04:04.200
Don't with the thing!

04:04.240 --> 04:06.680
Will you stop it
with the Big Bopper stuff?

04:06.760 --> 04:08.880
- Hi,John!
- Not too good, huh?

04:08.920 --> 04:12.600
Why is it every girl around here
is ugly or has a boyfriend?

04:12.680 --> 04:16.680
Where is the dazzling beauty
I've been searching for all my life?

04:16.720 --> 04:20.880
I know what you mean.
The pickings are really gettin' slim.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.880
The whole strip is shrinkin'.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.120
You know, I remember
about five years ago...

04:27.200 --> 04:29.960
it would take a couple of hours
and a tank full of gas...

04:30.000 --> 04:32.240
just to make one circuit.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.600
It was really somethin'.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.480
Hey,John.
Someone new in town.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.200
Are you gonna go after him?

04:46.280 --> 04:48.680
Hey, listen, professor.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.960
If he can't find me, then he ain't
even worth racin', right?

04:52.040 --> 04:54.200
Big shot.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.320
Well?

04:58.320 --> 04:59.800
Where was I?

05:00.680 --> 05:02.760
How you thought
high school romances were goofy...

05:02.800 --> 05:05.560
and we started dating only because
you thought I was cute and funny...

05:05.640 --> 05:07.640
but then you suddenly realized...

05:07.720 --> 05:09.520
you were in love with me,
it was serious

05:13.560 --> 05:16.280
You were leadin' up
to somethin' kinda big.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.520
You make it sound like
I'm giving dictation.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.640
Well, seriously...

05:23.720 --> 05:25.760
what I meant was that...

05:25.960 --> 05:28.520
since we do care for each other
so much...

05:28.600 --> 05:33.760
and since we should really consider
ourselves as adults now

05:37.000 --> 05:39.200
Could I have a couple
of those fries?

05:41.600 --> 05:43.440
Where was I?

05:43.520 --> 05:45.360
- Consider ourselves adults.
- Right, right.

05:45.440 --> 05:49.480
I thought,
maybe before I leave...

05:49.520 --> 05:51.520
we could agree that...

05:54.560 --> 05:58.520
seeing other people while I'm away
can't possibly hurt, you know?

06:05.160 --> 06:08.880
- You mean dating other people?
- It would strengthen our relationship.

06:08.960 --> 06:12.040
Then we'd know for sure
that we're really in love.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.040
Not that there's any doubt.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.840
I think you're right.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.920
I mean, we're not kids anymore...

06:27.960 --> 06:30.480
and it's silly to think
that when we're 3,000 miles apart...

06:30.520 --> 06:33.000
we shouldn't be able
to see other people and go out.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.240
Laurie, listen.
I didn't ask for that back.

06:35.280 --> 06:38.200
I know. I just sort of think
it's juvenile now.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.240
I'll keep it at home.
It's less conspicuous there.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.360
- You don't wanna wear it?
- I didn't say that.

06:42.440 --> 06:45.000
I understand,
and I'm not upset.

06:45.040 --> 06:49.320
I can't expect you to be a monk
while you're away.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.280
I got a really neat
record collection.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.960
I even got "Pledging My Love"
by Johnny Ace.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.520
How can you love Nelson when
he's going out with Marilyn Gator?

06:57.560 --> 07:00.520
- Since he dumped on you--
- He didn't dump on me, you little dip!

07:00.560 --> 07:02.720
Oh, hi, Steve.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.800
Hey, sis.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.600
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.680
- What is it?
- Nothing!

07:16.400 --> 07:20.600
I've decided to let you take care
of my car while I'm away.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.200
At least until Christmas.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.120
I'm comin' back for a couple
of weeks at Christmas.

07:24.200 --> 07:28.400
I've got some very simple instructions
for you. Here's the keys.

07:28.480 --> 07:31.960
First of all,
only 30-weight Castrol-R.

07:32.040 --> 07:35.400
I've written the tire pressure
and stuff on a pad in the glove

07:35.440 --> 07:37.720
- Are you listening?
- Hey, what's wrong?

07:38.520 --> 07:42.160
- Are you crying?
- I can't believe it!

07:43.080 --> 07:45.080
I don't know what to say!

07:45.160 --> 07:48.760
I'll love and protect this car
until death do us part.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.920
This is a super fine machine.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.840
This might even be better than
Darryl Starbird's superfeck moon

07:53.920 --> 07:57.720
It is! It's better than
Darryl Starbird's superfeck moonbird.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.240
Budda?

08:00.760 --> 08:03.520
How'd you like to go
to the drive-in movies with me?

08:03.600 --> 08:07.280
- You gotta be kidding.
- Would I kid about a thing like that?

08:07.360 --> 08:09.200
I have a new car.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.280
Did she do that to you?

08:16.360 --> 08:19.160
Curt, you wanna bomb around?
I wanna try out my new wheels.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.080
Well, I'd like to, Toad...

08:21.160 --> 08:23.280
but I'm gonna go
with Steve and Laurie to the hop.

08:23.320 --> 08:27.160
- Besides, I'd spoil your luck.
- Yeah, right.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.320
Tonight, things are gonna be
different.

08:29.360 --> 08:33.240
Wait a minute.
You're goin' to the freshman hop?

08:33.320 --> 08:35.520
Come on, man!
That place is for kids.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.360
You two just got your ass outta there.
Don't go back there.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.919
You ain't got no emotions?

08:40.000 --> 08:43.799
We are going to remember
all of the good times.

08:43.880 --> 08:46.680
- Yeah, well, go.
- Why don'tyou come with us?

08:46.760 --> 08:49.840
- Bullshit, man!
- Come on. For old times' sake.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.240
Listen, you go.
Go ahead, Curtsie baby.

08:52.320 --> 08:55.240
You go on over there and remember
the good times you won't be havin'.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.560
I ain't goin' off to some
god damn fancy college.

08:57.640 --> 09:01.160
I'm stayin' right here--
havin' fun as usual!

09:02.800 --> 09:06.320
Jesus, Milner, you're really
in a great mood tonight!

09:06.400 --> 09:08.680
What's the matter,John?

09:12.040 --> 09:14.360
Did I do somethin' wrong?
I'm sorry.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.520
Man, it's nothin'.

09:18.840 --> 09:21.680
- We'll see you later, okay?
- All right.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.840
We'll all do somethin' together
before Steve leaves.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.520
Wait a minute.
Now you're not goin'?

09:29.560 --> 09:31.360
I don't know.

10:13.360 --> 10:16.600
- Hey, Milner!
- What happened to your fat head?

10:17.600 --> 10:19.960
- What happened to your fat head?
- Your mother!

10:21.720 --> 10:24.920
Your mother!
Hey, we been talkin' 'bout you.

10:25.920 --> 10:29.040
There's a very wicked
'55 Chevy lookin' for you.

10:29.120 --> 10:33.120
- Yeah, I know.
- Watch out for the cop at Jerry's.

10:33.240 --> 10:34.560
Yeah, all right. Thanks.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.160
Hey, Toad!

10:52.240 --> 10:54.960
Is that you
in that beautiful car?

10:55.040 --> 10:58.000
Jeez, what a waste
of machinery!

11:10.160 --> 11:11.760
Hey, kid!

11:24.000 --> 11:27.480
All right, baby.
Here we go with another call.

11:28.560 --> 11:32.680
-Answer the phone, dummy.
- Pinkie's Pizza.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.600
You got anymore of those
secret agent spy scoops?

11:35.720 --> 11:37.080
Hit parade
on astethoscope?

11:37.160 --> 11:39.960
No, secret agent spyscope, man...

11:40.040 --> 11:41.920
that pulls in the moon,
stars, the planets...

11:42.000 --> 11:44.920
and the satellites
and little bitty spacemen.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.880
You have the wrong number,
partner.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.200
Wait!
What did you say?

12:04.720 --> 12:06.560
Quick. Quick.
Hang a right.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.120
- What? Why?
- Steven, cut over to "G" Street.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.480
I just saw a vision.
I saw a goddess.

12:12.560 --> 12:13.920
Come on.
You gotta catch up to her.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.880
- I didn't see anything.
- Come on, Curt.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.800
We can't be spendin' half the night
chasing girls down for you.

12:18.880 --> 12:24.080
Laurie, this was the most perfect,
dazzling creature I've ever seen!

12:24.160 --> 12:26.480
- She's gone. Forget it.
- She spoke to me.

12:26.560 --> 12:30.320
She spoke to me through the window!
I think she said, "I love you".

12:31.760 --> 12:33.720
That means nothing
to you people?

12:33.840 --> 12:37.360
You have no romance,
no soul?

12:37.440 --> 12:41.480
Someone wants me. Someone
roaming the streets wants me.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.440
Will you turn the corner?

12:48.720 --> 12:50.720
- Later.
- Alligator.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.840
You're new around here.
Where you from?

13:04.880 --> 13:08.280
- Turlock.
- You know a guy named Frank Bartlett?

13:08.400 --> 13:10.560
No. Does he go to Turlock High?

13:10.640 --> 13:13.080
Well, he used to.
He goes to J.C. now.

13:13.200 --> 13:16.320
- Do you go to J.C.?
- Yeah, sure.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.800
Wow! Do you know Guy Phillips?

13:18.920 --> 13:21.080
Yeah, sure.
I got him in a class.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.880
He's so boss!

13:22.960 --> 13:25.640
How'd you like to ride around
with me for a while?

13:25.680 --> 13:27.920
I'm sorry. I can't.
I'm going steady.

13:29.640 --> 13:33.200
- Come on!
- I just can't.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.080
You're just ridin' around
with a bunch of girls.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.000
Anybody else in there
wanna go for a ride?

13:40.080 --> 13:42.840
You got nothin' to fear.
I'm as harmless as a baby kitten.

13:42.920 --> 13:47.040
- I'll go! I'll go!
-Judy's sister'll go with you, okay?

13:47.120 --> 13:50.560
Yeah, sure.
Judy, her sister, her mother...

13:50.640 --> 13:52.520
Anybody.
I'll take 'em all.

13:52.560 --> 13:55.000
Listen. We'll go up
and stop at that light.

13:55.120 --> 13:58.400
It'll turn red by the time we get there.
All right?

13:58.480 --> 14:01.760
If you ever get tired of going steady
with somebody that ain't around...

14:01.840 --> 14:04.080
I'm up for grabs.

14:25.440 --> 14:29.000
So, you're Judy's little--
Shit! How old are you?

14:29.520 --> 14:31.240
I'm old enough.
How old are you?

14:31.280 --> 14:33.760
- I'm too old for you.
- You can't be that old.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.720
I think you better go back
and sit with your sister.

14:36.840 --> 14:40.400
Where are they anyway? Are they
comin' back? This is a joke, right?

14:40.480 --> 14:43.000
This better be a joke,
'cause I'm not drivin' you around!

14:43.120 --> 14:46.400
You asked me. What's the matter?
Am I too ugly?

14:47.440 --> 14:51.200
Judy doesn't want me with her,
and now you don't want me with you.

14:51.280 --> 14:55.160
Nobody wants me.
Even my mother and father hate me.

14:55.280 --> 14:58.120
- Everybody hates me.
- They don't hate ya.

14:58.160 --> 15:01.800
- You throw me out, I'll scream.
- No, no. Stay cool.

15:01.840 --> 15:04.720
Everything's all right.
We'll find your sister.

15:04.840 --> 15:08.560
- Can't be too hard to find.
-John, you gonna be there tonight?

15:08.640 --> 15:10.200
Shit! Hey, get down.

15:15.440 --> 15:20.480
- Is this called "copping a feel"?
- What? No! Get up. Jesus.

15:20.560 --> 15:23.000
- What's your name?
- My name?

15:23.120 --> 15:25.280
Mud, if anybody sees you.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.640
- What do you got in there, kid?
- More than you can handle.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.400
Excuse me.
I think we've had an accident.

16:07.520 --> 16:11.200
Damn it, I won't report you this time,
but next time,just watch it!

16:32.560 --> 16:35.760
- Good evening. How are ya?
- Yeah, hi.

16:35.840 --> 16:39.520
This is really a beautiful car,
you know? Of course you know it.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.600
You know what I'd like to give you
for this car?

16:41.680 --> 16:44.000
I'd like to give you $1,000!

16:44.080 --> 16:47.120
I can't give you that, but I'm not gonna
give you a whole line.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.160
I'm gonna tell you
what I can give you. Come over here.

16:50.240 --> 16:54.000
How would you like, for $525,
to own this practically new 'Vette?

16:54.080 --> 16:55.920
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.440
I'm gonna knock ten percent
right off the top. How about that?

16:59.560 --> 17:02.720
- That's $98 down.
- No, I'm sorry.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.599
$98 a month.
You ask me how can I do this?

17:05.680 --> 17:08.040
I'll tell you
how I can do it.

17:08.079 --> 17:10.800
My boss wants to get rid
of the sporty cars.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.760
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

17:13.839 --> 17:15.359
I don't think it's a good idea.

17:15.440 --> 17:17.800
- I'm busy.
- I want you to listen.

17:17.839 --> 17:20.400
I've gotta go!

17:20.480 --> 17:22.760
Leave me alone,
for God's sake!

17:25.960 --> 17:28.240
One, two, three, four

17:41.360 --> 17:43.080
At the hop

17:46.240 --> 17:49.360
You can rock it, you can roll it
Do the stomp, even stroll it at the hop

17:50.440 --> 17:53.680
When there cords start spinnin,you
can mix it with the chicken at the hop

17:54.800 --> 17:57.640
Do the dance sensation
that's sweepin' the nation at the hop

17:59.680 --> 18:03.120
Let's go to the hop

18:13.280 --> 18:15.760
You can swing, you can groove it, you
can really start to move it at the hop

18:17.360 --> 18:21.200
Where the jockey is the smoothest
And the music is the coolest at the hop

18:21.680 --> 18:24.560
All the guys and chicks
can get their kicks at the hop

18:38.800 --> 18:39.680
Let's go!

19:03.360 --> 19:05.720
Why are you so depressed?

19:05.800 --> 19:08.000
You'll forget him in a week.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.800
After you're elected Senior Queen,
you'll have so many boys after your bod.

19:11.880 --> 19:15.920
Peggy, the point is, I do not want
to go out with any other guys.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.320
Laurie, I know
it's a drag, but you can't just--

19:20.400 --> 19:23.360
Remember what happened
to Evelyn Chelnick?

19:23.440 --> 19:26.560
When Mike went into the Marines,
she had a nervous breakdown...

19:26.640 --> 19:29.520
and was acting so wacky
she got run over by a bus.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.160
I just wish I could
go with him.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.720
Laurie,jeez! Come on.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.480
Hey, zit makeup!
Hey, everybody--

19:40.560 --> 19:42.800
Just cool it, Steve?

19:45.840 --> 19:47.920
Let me see
some of that stuff.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.360
You leavin' tomorrow?

19:50.400 --> 19:53.640
- You and Laurie engaged yet?
- No, but we got it all worked out.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.120
We're still gonna be goin' together,
but we can date other people.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.480
And screw around.
I know.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.800
Hey, I hear college girls
really put out.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.120
When I saw her
standing there

20:10.160 --> 20:13.040
I had to pick her up
I couldn't fail

20:13.120 --> 20:18.760
'Cause I knew
I had to make her mine

20:18.800 --> 20:21.920
She's so cool
She's so fine

20:26.440 --> 20:29.320
I was tryin' to think
of words to say

20:29.360 --> 20:32.560
So I went up to her
and changed my fate

20:35.760 --> 20:38.120
- Come on.
- "Come on" what?

20:39.120 --> 20:41.480
- Let's dance.
- No, thanks.

20:43.440 --> 20:47.640
- Laurie, I said I wanna dance.
- Who's stopping you?

20:47.720 --> 20:51.880
I thought you might wanna dance with me
our last night together.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.480
How sentimental of you.
You'll be back at Christmas.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.680
- I want to dance now, not at Christmas.
- Get your cooties off me!

21:06.760 --> 21:09.480
- Don't make a scene.
- Go ahead. Slug me. Scar my face!

21:09.520 --> 21:12.400
I wouldn't dance with you
if you were the last guy in this gym.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.360
- This is getting good.
- Come on, Eddie, I'll dance with you.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.440
You don't mind, do you, Peggy?

21:19.920 --> 21:21.800
Joe College strikes out.

22:13.320 --> 22:15.760
Feel so good

22:16.240 --> 22:18.720
Take me by my hand

22:32.000 --> 22:35.440
And let's go strollin'

22:35.520 --> 22:38.320
In Wonderland

22:45.200 --> 22:47.680
Curtis, come here.
Help me, will ya? I'm surrounded.

22:47.760 --> 22:50.640
- Come here.
- You won't dance? Come on.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.560
No, really, I'd like to,
but I can't.

22:52.640 --> 22:55.680
I fold Mr. Simpson saw me dancing
with one of you sexy little--

22:55.760 --> 22:59.200
excuse me --one ofyou young ladies,
he'd have my rear end.

23:03.440 --> 23:06.400
Come on, gentlemen, back inside.
Put it out. Let's go.

23:06.480 --> 23:09.640
Kids! Want a cigarette?

23:10.720 --> 23:12.560
All right.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.840
- I thought you'd left.
- No, not yet. I have no matches.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.520
That's all right.

23:20.800 --> 23:25.560
Brother! How do I get stuck
with dance supervision?

23:25.640 --> 23:27.760
You goin' back east?

23:27.840 --> 23:32.320
I remember the day I went off.
Got drunk as hell the night before.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.080
- Blotto.
- Blotto. Exactly.

23:35.120 --> 23:39.200
- Barfed on the train all the next day.
- Cute. Very cute.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.200
Where'd you go again?

23:41.360 --> 23:43.280
Middlebury. Vermont.

23:43.360 --> 23:46.000
- Got a scholarship.
- Only stayed a semester.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.480
One semester, after all that.
Came back here.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.440
Why'd you come back?

23:50.480 --> 23:53.640
Decided I wasn't
the competitive type.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.560
I don't know.
Maybe I was scared.

23:57.760 --> 24:00.880
Well, I think I may find
that I'm not...

24:00.960 --> 24:03.160
the competitive type myself.

24:03.240 --> 24:08.440
- What do you mean?
- I'm not really sure that I'm going.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.600
Now, don't be stupid. Experience life.
Have some fun, Curtis--

24:11.680 --> 24:13.480
Bill?

24:14.880 --> 24:18.280
Mr. Wolfe?
Can I speak with you a minute?

24:19.880 --> 24:22.320
- Hi, Curt.
-Jane.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.960
Good luck, Curtis.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.360
Yeah. I'll see ya.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.080
Thanks a lot.

24:55.480 --> 24:59.240
A Wolfman Jack exclusive!

24:59.280 --> 25:01.720
The Beach Boys, baby.
A brand-new group.

25:01.840 --> 25:04.120
I predict they gonna go
a long way.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.280
This is called
"Surfin'Safari".

25:06.400 --> 25:09.400
Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learnin' how

25:09.520 --> 25:12.400
Come on and safari with me

25:13.880 --> 25:16.520
Early in the mornin'
we'll be startin' out

25:16.560 --> 25:19.440
Some honeys
will be comin' along

25:19.560 --> 25:23.040
The next night
we went out with ammunition--

25:23.120 --> 25:25.520
Don't you have some homework
or somethin' to do?

25:25.560 --> 25:27.480
No sweat.
My mother does it.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.080
Anyway,
he thought he was had.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.200
He started the car and couldn't see
through the windshield...

25:32.280 --> 25:34.600
and zoomed straight
into the canal.

25:34.640 --> 25:37.760
- I still got some-- don't try anything.
- Watch it, will ya?

25:37.840 --> 25:40.800
Jesus Christ!
Thanks a lot.

25:43.120 --> 25:46.480
Hey, drivin' is
a serious business.

25:46.600 --> 25:49.840
I ain't havin' no accidents
just because of you.

25:55.800 --> 25:58.640
Come on. Don't give me any grief.
I'm warning ya.

25:58.680 --> 26:00.560
Spare me, killer.

26:03.920 --> 26:05.200
Oh, shit!

26:06.920 --> 26:10.480
- Why did you do that?
- I don't like that surfin' shit.

26:12.240 --> 26:15.200
Rock and roll's been goin' down hill
ever since Buddy Holly died.

26:15.280 --> 26:17.520
Don't you think
the Beach Boys are boss?

26:17.560 --> 26:20.080
- You would, you grungy little twerp.
- Grungy!

26:20.240 --> 26:23.920
You big weenie.
If I had a boyfriend, he'd pound you.

26:23.960 --> 26:26.800
Yeah, sure. Shit!

26:26.920 --> 26:30.520
- Holstein!
- Good. A cop.

26:30.600 --> 26:33.000
I'm gonna tell him
you tried to rape me.

26:33.080 --> 26:35.800
I'm gonna tell him how old I am,
my parents don't know I'm out...

26:35.880 --> 26:37.680
and you tried to rape me.

26:37.720 --> 26:40.240
- Yeah, with shaving cream.
- Boy, are you up a creek.

26:40.360 --> 26:43.120
Come on. Really, Carol,
don't say anything.

26:43.480 --> 26:45.800
If you say:
"I was a dirty bird.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.880
Carol's not grungy.
She's bitchin'"...

26:49.360 --> 26:50.920
Say it. I'll tell him.

26:56.080 --> 26:59.400
I was a dirty bird.
Carol's not grungy. She's bitchin'.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.160
I'll think about it.

27:09.520 --> 27:12.640
- Where you goin', Milner?
- I'm goin' home, sir.

27:12.720 --> 27:17.240
- Where've you been?
- We were-- At the movies, sir.

27:17.320 --> 27:20.840
You didn't happen to be around 12th
and "G" about 8:30 tonight, did you?

27:20.920 --> 27:25.200
No. No, sir.
We were at the movies, like I said.

27:27.800 --> 27:31.120
I stopped you because the light
on your license plate's out.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.560
I'm gonna have
to cite you for that.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.960
And the front end
of this thing you're drivin'...

27:37.040 --> 27:38.880
looks a little low.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.880
No, sir.
It's 12 1/2 inches, regulation size.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.040
It's been checked several times.
You can check it if you like, sir.

27:47.920 --> 27:52.480
Look, Milner. Listen.
You can't fool with the law.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.520
We know that was you tonight.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.440
We have an excellent
description of this car.

27:56.520 --> 27:59.800
I could run you in right now,
and I could make it stick.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.640
But I'm not gonna do that.
You know why?

28:02.800 --> 28:04.640
I want to catch you in the act...

28:04.720 --> 28:06.800
and when I do,
I'm gonna nail you but good.

28:11.120 --> 28:13.200
Happy birthday, Milner.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.960
Thank you, asshole.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.920
You're a regular J.D.

28:18.960 --> 28:22.520
File that under C.S.
over there.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.640
C.S.?
What's that stand for?

28:24.720 --> 28:27.680
Chicken shit.
That's what it is.

29:00.720 --> 29:03.520
Ain't he neat?

29:03.600 --> 29:07.800
You know a guy around here
with a piss-yellow deuce coupe?

29:07.880 --> 29:11.000
- Supposed to be hot stuff?
- You mean John Milner?

29:11.080 --> 29:13.720
Ain't nobody can beat him, man.
He's got the fastest--

29:13.800 --> 29:17.400
- I ain't nobody, dork. Right?
- Right.

29:17.480 --> 29:20.920
You see this Milner,
you tell him I'm lookin' for him, huh?

29:21.040 --> 29:24.320
Tell him I aim to blow his ass
right off the road.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.280
Ain't he neat?

29:41.840 --> 29:45.200
What a babe!
What a bitchin' babe!

30:01.840 --> 30:03.480
Hello.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.240
You sure you don't
need a lift somewhere?

30:08.280 --> 30:12.240
You know John Milner?
John Milner's a good friend of mine.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
Did anybody ever tell you that you look
just like Connie Stevens?

30:17.080 --> 30:20.000
- You do. I really mean it.
- For real?

30:20.080 --> 30:22.480
Yeah. I met her once
at a Dick Clark road show.

30:22.520 --> 30:26.000
-Yeah? You really think I look like her?
-Yeah, no shit.

30:26.120 --> 30:29.760
I'm sorry. I mean-- I mean that
I'm not just feeding you a line.

30:29.840 --> 30:33.120
I really think you do.
You look like Connie Stevens.

30:33.200 --> 30:35.680
- What's your name?
- Debbie.

30:35.760 --> 30:38.000
I always thought
I look like Sandra Dee.

30:39.760 --> 30:43.240
- Well, you look a lot like her too.
- Is this your car?

30:43.320 --> 30:45.160
Yeah. I'm Terry, the--

30:46.960 --> 30:51.160
- They usually call me Terry the Tiger.
- It's really tough-lookin'.

30:51.280 --> 30:55.120
- What school you go to?
- Dewey. Can it lay rubber?

30:55.280 --> 30:58.840
Yeah, I got a 327 Chevy in it.
It's got six Strombergs.

30:58.920 --> 31:03.120
That's bitchin' tuck-and-roll.
I really love the feel of tuck-and-roll.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.080
You do?

31:05.200 --> 31:09.880
Well, come in. I'll let you feel it.
I mean you can touch it if you want.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.840
I'll let you feel the upholstery.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.640
Okay.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.720
- Peel out.
- What?

31:29.800 --> 31:32.320
Peel out.
I just love it when guys peel out.

31:39.960 --> 31:43.880
And they came all the way
from Stockton. Let's hear it.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.320
I don't care
if you leave this second.

31:47.440 --> 31:52.120
And we wanna thank Darby Langdon,
who did all these neat decorations.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.000
Now the next dance
is gonna be a snowball...

31:57.080 --> 32:00.840
and leading it off is lastyear's
class president, Steve Bolander...

32:00.880 --> 32:04.160
and this year's head cheerleader,
Laurie Henderson.

32:17.400 --> 32:19.280
- Come on.
- ""Come on"" what?

32:19.360 --> 32:21.800
Steven, please.
Smile or something.

32:35.760 --> 32:37.600
Quit pinching!

32:37.680 --> 32:40.840
You think I care if you go off?
You think I'm gonna crack up?

32:40.920 --> 32:44.320
- Boy, are you conceited!
- I don't know why I ever asked you out.

32:44.400 --> 32:48.040
- You didn't. I asked you out.
- What do you mean, you asked me out?

32:48.120 --> 32:50.000
Backwards Day.
Remember?

32:50.040 --> 32:53.200
If I had waited for you to ask me--
Oh, brother!

32:53.280 --> 32:55.880
Even after that, you didn't call me
for two weeks.

32:55.960 --> 33:00.240
- I was busy.
- You were scared. Dave Ogler told me.

33:00.280 --> 33:03.520
When you did ask me out,
you didn't kiss me for three dates.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.960
- Well, I was--
- Scared. Jim Kiler told me.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.120
I even asked my father
why you hadn't kissed me.

33:10.200 --> 33:13.160
- Your father. Great.
- You know what he said?

33:13.240 --> 33:15.240
He said he thought
you were bright enough...

33:15.320 --> 33:18.640
and that you'd probably
get around to it after a while.

33:18.720 --> 33:21.080
You didn't, of course.
I had to.

33:22.480 --> 33:25.160
Remember the picnic?

33:25.240 --> 33:26.960
Out at the canyon?

33:27.120 --> 33:30.000
Boy! You don't remember
anything, do you?

33:30.160 --> 33:32.880
The first one,
up at the lake.

33:32.920 --> 33:35.000
That was the first time
you kissed me.

33:36.880 --> 33:40.560
I had to practically
throw myself at you.

33:40.640 --> 33:41.800
I remember.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.440
What's wrong?

34:10.520 --> 34:12.080
Go to hell.

34:18.560 --> 34:21.199
What are you doin',
stealin' hubcaps?

34:21.280 --> 34:24.719
- Well, hey, Wendy.
- How've you been?

34:24.840 --> 34:26.800
Fine.

34:26.880 --> 34:30.920
- Great. How you been?
- Wait a sec.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.880
Wait a minute!

34:33.600 --> 34:35.520
Bobbie Tucker.
She's got her car.

34:37.280 --> 34:40.480
- Heard you're going away to school.
- Maybe, maybe.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.159
- What?
- Same old Curt.

34:44.239 --> 34:48.159
All the time we were going together,
you never knew what you were doing.

34:51.120 --> 34:55.040
- I gotta go.
- Where ya goin'?

34:55.159 --> 34:58.000
- Nowhere.
- You mind if I come along?

34:58.040 --> 35:00.640
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.640
Louie, Louie

35:06.160 --> 35:08.000
Me gotta go

35:09.640 --> 35:13.280
A fine little girl
She's waitin' for me

35:13.360 --> 35:17.040
Catch a ship
across the sea

35:17.120 --> 35:20.960
Sail the ship all alone

35:21.040 --> 35:24.400
Never think
I'll make it home

35:41.320 --> 35:44.720
All right, Bolander, break that up.
You know the rules.

35:44.800 --> 35:48.080
You and your girlfriend wanna do that,
go someplace else, huh?

35:48.160 --> 35:51.120
Hey, Kroot.
Why don't you go kiss a duck?

35:51.240 --> 35:54.640
- What did you say?
- I said go kiss a duck, marble-head.

35:54.720 --> 35:58.000
All right, Bolander,
you are suspended.

35:58.040 --> 36:01.080
Don't you even come in Monday.
You're out!

36:03.120 --> 36:05.240
I graduated last semester.
Remember?

36:23.520 --> 36:26.160
Why don't we go out
to the canal?

36:26.240 --> 36:28.560
What for?

36:28.600 --> 36:30.920
Listen, I can get tough
with you too, you know.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.040
Hard guy.

36:50.080 --> 36:54.160
A double Chubby Chuck, a chili-barb,
two orders of French fries and--

36:54.240 --> 36:56.760
- Cherry Coke.
- And two Cherry Cokes.

36:58.240 --> 37:00.120
What?

37:01.200 --> 37:02.480
Right. Cool.

37:04.080 --> 37:06.600
Hey, Deb.
How's my soft baby?

37:06.680 --> 37:08.520
Come on. Beat it, Vic.
I'm not your baby.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.880
Come on, honey.
So I never called you back.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.840
I been, you know, busy.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.720
Yeah, three weeks?

37:16.800 --> 37:18.800
Besides, it only took me one night
to realize...

37:18.880 --> 37:21.280
if brains were dynamite,
you couldn't blow your nose.

37:21.360 --> 37:25.360
Look who's talking. Who's the wimp
you're hangin' out with now? Einstein?

37:25.440 --> 37:28.400
Tiger happens to be
very intelligent, unlike you.

37:28.520 --> 37:32.960
I know everything your dirty little mind
is thinking. It shows.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.880
Hey, now, buddy, look.
The lady obviously doesn't want--

37:35.920 --> 37:38.000
Look, creep. You want
a knuckle sandwich?

37:38.120 --> 37:40.920
No, thanks. I'm waitin'
for a double Chubby Chuck.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.560
Then keep your smart-ass
mouth shut.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.400
I'll call you sometime, Deb.

37:44.520 --> 37:48.000
- Some night when I'm hard up.
- I won't be home.

37:50.120 --> 37:52.160
Get out of here.

37:53.560 --> 37:55.560
You seem to know
a lot of weird guys.

37:55.640 --> 37:59.200
That creep's not a friend of mine.
He's just horny.

37:59.280 --> 38:02.160
That's why I like you.
You're different.

38:02.200 --> 38:05.360
I-- I am? I mean,
you really think I'm intelligent?

38:05.440 --> 38:08.960
Yeah. And I bet you're smart enough
to get us some brew.

38:12.080 --> 38:15.160
Brew? Oh, liquor.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.280
Yeah, this place is
too crowded anyway.

38:31.800 --> 38:36.520
What about your hamburgers
and Cokes, sir?

38:39.240 --> 38:42.320
Will you speed up?
You're gonna lose her.

38:42.440 --> 38:46.160
Cut around him.
Just hang a right at the corner.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.560
Lost her again.

38:48.680 --> 38:51.280
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.160
But I'm gonna find out.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.160
I know who she is.

39:00.240 --> 39:02.000
Well, come on, Bob.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.240
Come on! Who is she?

39:06.480 --> 39:08.280
Come on!

39:08.400 --> 39:12.040
You know Mr. Beeman?
He owns Hepcat Jewelers?

39:14.000 --> 39:15.800
That's his wife.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.880
Get outta here.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.680
That's ridiculous.
That girl is young and beautiful.

39:20.760 --> 39:23.640
- And married.
- And she was cruising Tenth Street.

39:23.760 --> 39:26.200
You gotta be thinkin'
of someone else.

39:26.320 --> 39:30.480
Did you know that my ex is going
to become a presidential aide?

39:33.920 --> 39:37.200
It's a secret, so don't tell anybody,
but his greatest ambition...

39:37.280 --> 39:39.600
is to shake hands
with President Kennedy.

39:41.280 --> 39:44.880
How do you suppose you're gonna
do that, wishy-washy, at J.C.?

39:45.000 --> 39:47.600
Maybe I've grown up.
Maybe I changed my mind.

39:47.720 --> 39:50.520
- Doubt it.
- Maybe you don't think you can do it.

39:50.640 --> 39:53.200
- Maybe you oughta shut up.
- Maybe I ought to, but I won't.

39:53.320 --> 39:56.200
Maybe you oughta
come into the aft chamber...

39:56.280 --> 39:58.600
where we can
discuss this in private.

40:03.120 --> 40:05.200
Thanks a lot.

40:05.720 --> 40:07.320
Come on, Wendy.

40:13.360 --> 40:16.240
Move over.
I'm not sitting on your lap.

40:19.440 --> 40:22.360
- To the opera, James.
- Drop dead.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.600
Unless you want to go to Gallo Dam
and have a little orgy.

40:24.720 --> 40:25.800
You wish!

40:25.880 --> 40:29.480
I could pick up some margarine.
We could roll around in it for a while.

40:55.360 --> 40:57.920
- I've been silly.
- Yeah?

40:58.040 --> 40:59.920
I'm really glad
you're gonna stay.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.520
We might even have
a class together.

41:08.280 --> 41:09.360
- Maybe.
- Look.

41:09.360 --> 41:10.120
- Maybe.
- Look.

41:10.200 --> 41:12.920
There's Kip Pullman.
He's so neat.

41:13.040 --> 41:15.760
Say somethin' to him
when we go by.

41:15.880 --> 41:18.920
- What do you want me to say?
- Anything. I just wanna meet him.

41:20.040 --> 41:21.840
Hey, Kip, buddy.
What's up?

41:21.960 --> 41:24.840
Hey, Henderson, long time no see.
What you been doin'?

41:24.920 --> 41:27.240
Nothin'.

41:27.320 --> 41:31.280
I just wanted to tell you
Bobbie here is madly in love with you...

41:31.360 --> 41:34.200
and trembles at the sight
of your rippling biceps.

41:38.840 --> 41:42.800
- Out of my car, you--
- Wait a second!

41:42.920 --> 41:47.120
I hate you!
Get out of my car!

41:48.040 --> 41:49.800
Temper, temper!

42:40.040 --> 42:43.120
Here it is:
one ten-cent Coke with ice.

42:43.240 --> 42:47.560
And don't take all day
drinkin' it. Please.

42:47.640 --> 42:50.480
Rats! I thought
some of my friends might be here.

42:50.480 --> 42:53.360
Probably a couple of weeks
past their bed time.

42:53.440 --> 42:55.480
There's Dee Dee.
I hope she sees me.

42:55.600 --> 42:57.200
Oh, shit. Dee Dee.

42:59.440 --> 43:01.320
Hiya,John.

43:01.400 --> 43:03.440
- What do you say, Al?
- Not much.

43:03.520 --> 43:06.400
You think if I brought my Mopar
by the shop on Monday...

43:06.480 --> 43:07.760
you could spot-weld
the bumper bracket?

43:07.840 --> 43:11.200
Sure, anything.Just come by
before noon, all right?

43:11.280 --> 43:14.720
- You met Linda?
- No, no. Hi, Linda.

43:14.800 --> 43:17.560
This is my cousin, Carol.

43:20.440 --> 43:22.560
I'm baby-sittin'.

43:22.640 --> 43:25.040
- Baby-sitting!
-Jesus! Watch it, will ya?

43:26.240 --> 43:29.600
Been hittin' me all night.
Kids will be kids, you know.

43:29.680 --> 43:33.200
Goddamn it! Why don't you
grow up, for Christ's sake?

43:33.280 --> 43:35.320
We don't get along too well,
you know?

43:36.600 --> 43:38.840
- Been like this all--
- You spastic creep.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.040
Hi, cousin.
How's your bod?

44:36.840 --> 44:41.360
Wolfman Top 40 is
Box 1300, Chula Vista.

44:41.440 --> 44:45.360
Wolfmans weat shirts
is Wolf Enterprises, Bakersfeld.

44:58.800 --> 45:01.200
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, son?

45:01.680 --> 45:03.600
I was wondering--

45:04.760 --> 45:06.800
- Could you give me the time?
- Sure.

45:06.880 --> 45:09.000
It's quarter to 12:00.

45:09.080 --> 45:11.480
Quarter to 12:00.
Good. Thanks a lot.

45:16.720 --> 45:19.680
Excuse me, sir.
I got a problem.

45:19.760 --> 45:22.520
See, I lost my I.D. in a food...

45:22.640 --> 45:25.400
and I was wondering,
since you're going in there anyway...

45:25.520 --> 45:28.000
could you pick me up
some Old Harper's-- hard stuff?

45:28.080 --> 45:30.800
- Would you buy me a bottle?
- Why, certainly.

45:30.960 --> 45:33.720
I lost my wife too.

45:33.840 --> 45:35.600
Her name wasn't Idy though...

45:35.640 --> 45:38.120
and it wasn't in a food,
but I know what you--

45:38.200 --> 45:42.040
Yeah, good. Here's some money.
Old Harper.

45:51.600 --> 45:53.920
- Quarter to 12:00.
- Right-o.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.920
- Night.
- Night.

46:04.120 --> 46:06.200
No, not wine!

46:30.280 --> 46:34.200
- Was there an old man in here just now?
- Yeah. Just went out the back.

46:34.280 --> 46:36.080
Want something?

46:38.760 --> 46:40.280
Yeah.

46:40.360 --> 46:43.000
Let me have
a Three Musketeers...

46:43.080 --> 46:46.680
and a ballpoint pen,
one of those combs there...

46:46.760 --> 46:48.560
a pint of Old Harper...

46:48.600 --> 46:51.640
a couple off ashlight batteries
and some beefjerky.

47:06.280 --> 47:08.400
You got an ID for the liquor?

47:10.440 --> 47:12.120
Yeah.

47:12.200 --> 47:14.480
Oh, nuts.
I left it in the car.

47:14.560 --> 47:17.680
Sorry. You'll have to get it before.

47:17.760 --> 47:20.680
I also--
I forgot the car.

47:28.960 --> 47:31.960
Did you get it?

47:32.040 --> 47:33.240
You got it!

47:36.000 --> 47:38.360
You didn't get it.
Why didn't you get it?

47:38.440 --> 47:41.720
I needed some things and
I thought as long as I was in there--

47:41.800 --> 47:45.520
Look, Debbie,
can you loan me a dollar?

47:45.560 --> 47:47.480
Are you for real? Come on.

47:47.560 --> 47:49.400
Girls don't pay. Guys pay.

47:49.480 --> 47:53.320
See, I've only got a 50,
and he doesn't have change.

47:56.560 --> 48:00.120
I can't believe this.
I really cannot believe this.

48:00.960 --> 48:02.640
Here.

48:07.000 --> 48:11.560
- Excuse me. Could you--
- Buy you a bottle of booze?

48:11.600 --> 48:14.640
Yeah, I know. You lost your I.D.
What kind doyou want?

48:14.680 --> 48:18.080
Gee, that's terrific.
Just some Old Harper?

49:00.040 --> 49:02.040
That one over there--
that's Freddy Benson's 'Vette.

49:02.120 --> 49:06.000
He had a head-on collision
with a drunk. Boom!

49:06.040 --> 49:08.080
Didn't have a chance.

49:08.120 --> 49:10.720
He was a good driver too.

49:10.800 --> 49:14.520
It's pretty grim when a guy gets it
and it's not even his own fault.

49:14.600 --> 49:16.440
Needs a paintjob,
that's for sure.

49:16.520 --> 49:18.360
See that over there? That '41 ?

49:18.440 --> 49:21.640
That used to be-- believe it or not--
the fastest car in the valley.

49:21.680 --> 49:24.080
I never got a chance
to race Earl, though.

49:24.120 --> 49:28.840
He got his 1955 in about
the hairiest crash we ever had here.

49:28.880 --> 49:30.720
Jesus, you should've seen it.

49:30.800 --> 49:33.520
Eight kids killed
and both drivers.

49:33.600 --> 49:37.080
Board of Education was real impressed,
so they filmed the whole thing.

49:37.160 --> 49:39.880
Now they show it
in driver's education classes.

49:39.920 --> 49:42.600
Probably see it
if you get lucky.

49:42.640 --> 49:47.200
Course, pretty tough
when they take somebody with them.

49:50.160 --> 49:53.040
You've never had an accident though.
You told me.

49:53.120 --> 49:55.440
Well, I come mighty close.

49:55.480 --> 49:57.960
Almost rolled it
a couple of times.

49:58.280 --> 50:01.880
But I've been just quick enough
to stay out of this graveyard.

50:04.560 --> 50:06.320
Bet you're the fastest.

50:07.800 --> 50:10.600
I've never been beat.
A lot of guys tried.

50:12.080 --> 50:15.120
Seems to me there's more guys lately
than there's ever been.

50:19.920 --> 50:23.120
Sneakin'around
with the Wolfman, baby.

50:26.080 --> 50:30.000
This is gonna strike arawnerve. Mama.
Here's The Platters.

50:30.880 --> 50:32.840
Oh, yes

50:32.880 --> 50:36.040
I'm the great pretender

50:38.080 --> 50:42.360
Pretending
that I'm doing well

50:43.400 --> 50:46.320
My need is such

50:46.360 --> 50:49.520
I pretend too much

50:49.600 --> 50:53.680
I'm lonely
but no one can tell

50:57.040 --> 50:58.800
What are you doin', creep?

51:00.800 --> 51:02.200
Who, me?

51:04.680 --> 51:07.160
No, I'm talkin'
to the other 50 creeps here.

51:11.160 --> 51:13.000
You know Gil Gonzales?

51:15.960 --> 51:17.840
No, I don't.

51:17.880 --> 51:20.440
Don't know Gil.
Well, you oughta.

51:20.520 --> 51:24.040
He's a friend of ours. That's his car
you got your butt parked on.

51:31.600 --> 51:33.560
- Where you goin'?
- Nowhere.

51:33.640 --> 51:36.400
You must be goin' some place.
You left here, didn'tya?

51:37.400 --> 51:39.560
Bring him over here.
I want to show him somethin'.

51:44.200 --> 51:45.720
Bend down here.
Look across here. See?

51:47.560 --> 51:49.480
Right across there.
You see?

51:50.120 --> 51:53.400
- I guess so.
- You scratched it, man.

51:53.480 --> 51:55.920
Where do you get off
sittin' on Gil's car, man?

51:55.960 --> 51:57.880
Sorry.

51:57.960 --> 52:00.080
It's really not much of a scratch.
I don't think you'd see it.

52:00.120 --> 52:05.040
It ain't the size that's in question
here. It's the principle!

52:05.080 --> 52:07.880
Jeez, this is gonna be tough.

52:11.720 --> 52:13.720
What should we do with you?

52:13.800 --> 52:16.280
Tie him to the car
and drag him.

52:23.760 --> 52:25.560
You know Toby Juarez?

52:27.080 --> 52:29.320
He's a Pharaoh, isn't he?

52:32.320 --> 52:33.920
Sure, we know Toby.

52:35.040 --> 52:37.360
We killed him last night.

52:37.440 --> 52:40.280
Tied him to the car
and dragged him.

52:46.160 --> 52:48.200
This is gonna take
some thinkin'.

52:55.160 --> 52:58.160
You better come with us and maybe
take a ride with the Pharaohs, huh?

52:58.240 --> 53:01.000
No, listen, I'd really like to,
but I've gotta--

53:02.800 --> 53:04.680
I'd rather--

53:04.720 --> 53:06.960
I know just howyou feel.

53:07.040 --> 53:09.520
- Shotgun.
- No, I called it.

53:09.560 --> 53:12.040
- When?
- Before we picked you up.

53:12.080 --> 53:14.280
You can't call it for the whole night.
I got it now.

53:14.320 --> 53:16.560
Get in the back, punk.

53:16.600 --> 53:20.160
Will you get in there?
Jesus!

54:03.920 --> 54:06.640
Rock 'n'roll will stand, man!

54:06.680 --> 54:09.120
Whois this
on the Wolfman telephone?

54:09.200 --> 54:11.520
- Hello, it's collect.
- Your name is Collette?

54:11.600 --> 54:14.720
- Yeah, collect call for Wolfman--
- Your name is Collette Call?

54:14.800 --> 54:17.200
- Sir, this is the operator.
- Are you French, operator?

54:17.280 --> 54:20.440
This is a collect call
for Wolfman Jack.

54:20.520 --> 54:23.480
- I love you, operator.
- Is this Wolfman Jack?

54:23.560 --> 54:26.960
- Is Floyd there?
- It's for Wolfman Jack.

54:27.040 --> 54:31.120
I just love listenin' to Wolfman.
My mom won't let me at home.

54:31.160 --> 54:34.040
Because he's a Negro.
I think he's terrific.

54:34.120 --> 54:36.000
Do you know that he broadcasts
from a plane...

54:36.080 --> 54:38.400
that fies around in circles
all the time?

54:38.480 --> 54:39.920
Do you believe that?

54:39.960 --> 54:42.520
Floyd, I love you, Floyd.

54:42.600 --> 54:44.920
Floyd, is this you, Floyd?

54:45.000 --> 54:47.120
Floyd, I cannot look on thee.

54:47.200 --> 54:49.840
Love took my hand
and smiling did reply...

54:49.920 --> 54:52.080
""Who made the eyes but I?""

54:52.120 --> 54:55.320
Floyd, reach out.
Touch my soul, Floyd!

54:55.400 --> 54:57.480
- Your party's ready, sir.
- Hello, Floyd!

54:59.400 --> 55:01.640
You tell her, Wolfman!
He's my man.

55:01.720 --> 55:03.800
When I graduate,
I'm gonna be a Wolfman.

55:03.880 --> 55:07.040
- He broadcasts out of Mexico someplace.
- No, he don't.

55:07.120 --> 55:09.120
I've seen the station
outside of town.

55:10.160 --> 55:13.840
That's just a clearing station.
So he can fool the cops.

55:13.880 --> 55:18.040
He blasts that thing around the world.
It's against the law, man.

55:18.120 --> 55:20.560
- They'll never catch the Wolfman.
- No way.

55:24.040 --> 55:25.960
Man, who cut the cheese?

55:27.640 --> 55:29.560
"" He who smelt it, dealt it.""

55:30.880 --> 55:33.920
There's that bad-ass Chevy again.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.240
Look at that snatch
he's got with him.

55:36.320 --> 55:39.440
- He looks like a wimp.
- Probably is.

55:39.480 --> 55:41.960
Wimps get all the snatch.

55:45.480 --> 55:49.360
Milner ain't gonna beat that.
His time has come.

55:49.440 --> 55:52.960
He's gettin' old.
He ain't as fast as he used to be.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.760
You got two seconds
to get your ass over in your corner.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.040
Don't worry,
I won't rape you.

56:02.400 --> 56:06.320
- You got a bitchin' car.
- Yeah, I know.

56:06.360 --> 56:11.280
In fact, your car's so neat,
we're gonna give you our special prize.

56:11.360 --> 56:13.200
You want me to give it to ya?

56:13.280 --> 56:16.120
Sweetheart, if the prize is you,
I'm a ready Teddy.

56:16.200 --> 56:18.360
Well, get bent, turkey!

56:22.120 --> 56:24.560
Very funny!

56:24.600 --> 56:28.240
What a chop! Ha-ha!
Quit laughing!

56:28.320 --> 56:30.960
-Jump out and fatten their tires.
- Wait a minute.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.680
-Just do what I say!
- All right, boss.

58:12.760 --> 58:14.840
It's a really beautiful
night tonight.

58:16.600 --> 58:19.440
It's a perfect night
for horseback riding.

58:19.480 --> 58:21.600
I was going with a guy
who had horses once.

58:21.800 --> 58:26.480
- Yeah? I had a couple of horses myself.
- Really?

58:26.520 --> 58:29.360
I used them for hunting.
I do a lot of hunting.

58:30.240 --> 58:33.840
Deer mostly.
Got a couple of bear lastyear.

58:33.920 --> 58:37.400
Those were good ponies. Had to
train 'em myself. Took a lot of time.

58:37.480 --> 58:40.400
Do you still have 'em?
We can go for a ride.

58:40.480 --> 58:44.520
No, no. I had to sell 'em
to get these wheels. And a Jeep.

58:45.760 --> 58:47.440
I got a Jeep pickup
with four-wheel drive.

58:47.520 --> 58:49.680
It's got a gun rack.
I use that for hunting mostly.

58:49.760 --> 58:52.880
Why do you kill little animals?
I think that's terrible.

58:52.960 --> 58:54.800
Well, yeah.

58:54.880 --> 58:58.680
I figure with bears, though,
it's me or them.

59:00.800 --> 59:03.600
- I think you're really neat.
- Wait a second.

59:03.680 --> 59:06.720
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

59:06.800 --> 59:10.480
I guess maybe it's the booze
or somethin'.

59:23.200 --> 59:25.280
- Oh! You pinched me.
- I'm sorry.

59:25.360 --> 59:27.600
Let me get my head
over here.

59:27.680 --> 59:29.840
You get up. Okay.

59:29.880 --> 59:32.800
My leg, my leg! Watch it.

59:38.640 --> 59:40.880
I just love
tuck-and-roll upholstery.

59:43.560 --> 59:46.480
Jesus, it's like
Grand Central Station around here.

59:46.520 --> 59:49.440
- Why don't we go someplace else?
- Come on. They won't come back.

59:49.520 --> 59:51.720
Wait a minute.

59:51.760 --> 59:54.720
I got a blanket in the back.
Why don't we go over into the field?

59:54.800 --> 59:56.720
All right. Okay.

59:58.920 --> 01:00:04.040
- How old are you?
- I'm 13. How old are you?

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:07.720
- I'm only 14.
- I love you, Wolfman.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.240
We're gonna do the weather
for the valleys and mountain tops.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.680
It's gonn abe hot.
About 200 degrees in Merced.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.720
Four hundred degrees
out in Fresno.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.160
And about 500 degrees
up around the valley somewhere.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:26.160
You got
the Wolfman Jack Show!

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:43.840
This is terrific.
I love miniature golf.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.920
Is that right?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.800
I hate it.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.960
I don't play it too often.
What are we doing here?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.920
We're outta gas, man.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.320
They don't sell gas here.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.240
I know.
But we're outta money too.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.920
What are you punks doin'?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:22.960
What's goin' on here?

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.040
Hi, Mr. Gordon.
What's up?

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.960
Henderson?
Curt Henderson?

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.920
Are you with these punks?

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.720
These are just
some friends of mine.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.280
We're just-- You know.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.520
You had me nervous there
for a second, huh?

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.560
You didn't leave yet, huh?

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.280
No, I'm not--

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:57.400
I'm not scheduled to leave
until tomorrow morning.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.960
Tomorrow?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.520
Hank Anderson's inside.
Come in and say good-bye.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:05.800
He brought your name up
at the Moose Hall. You got the check?

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.080
Hank, look who's here.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.400
How are you, Curt?
What a pleasant surprise.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:25.640
Congratulations, my boy.
We're all proud of you. All of us.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:30.240
The Moose scholarship went
to the right boy--you.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.440
And we're all proud of you.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.400
We're all done out here.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.080
All done?
What's he mean?

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.320
He means we're all done
having loads of fun out here.

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.720
You can have all the fun you want.
This place is for fun.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.480
Yes, it is.
Thank you. Thank you both.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.720
Good luck, son.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.840
Before I say good-bye, I hope
you'll be taking along with you...

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.960
a little piece of this place.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.880
I think I have.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.880
Good. Don't forget us.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.480
No, I won't forget you,
and you won't forget me.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.840
- Bye-bye.
- Good-bye and good luck.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.400
- It was nice to meet ya.
- What he said goes for me too.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.640
You just might make it
as a Pharaoh yet, boy.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.680
Someday he'll make
a fine Moose.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.040
What's the matter?

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.520
The radio's gone.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.000
That means the car is gone!
Come on.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.960
Oh, God! Not the car!

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.640
Oh, no! Anything!
Not the car!

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.720
You know,
it doesn't make sense...

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.760
to leave home
to look for home.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.480
To give up a life
to find a new life.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.720
To say good-bye to friends you love
just to find new friends.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:33.920
- Wait, could you say that again?
- Something Curt said.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.960
Figures.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.320
You must've talked his ear off
tryin' to get him to stay.

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.880
No, Steven. That's not true at all.
I didn't say anything.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.360
Curt just said at dinner tonight...

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:48.360
that he didn't see
what the big hurry was.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.360
He thought that he ought to stay
and go to J.C. for a while...

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:55.800
and try and figure out
what he wanted to do with his life.

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.440
- That sounds logical.
- Do you think so?

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.520
Sure. I think Curt's
probably right, for Curt.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.880
Not for me, though.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.880
Laurie, look at me.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.800
You know what I want out of life.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:19.280
And it's just not in this town.

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:26.480
I'm not going with you
to the airport tomorrow.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.680
- No, Steven, don't.
- Come on.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.400
It's our last night together
for three months.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.280
I know. But we've been
through this before.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.280
I'm gonna miss you so much.
I need something to remember you by.

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.640
You don't want me
to forget you, do you?

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.120
No.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.320
What's wrong?
You're just sitting there.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.800
- You want to. Go ahead.
- Not like that.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:10.160
If you're not gonna remember me
for anything else,just go ahead.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.480
Come on.
You want it and you know it.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.440
Don't be so damn
self-righteous with me...

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.400
after all that stuff you told me
about watching your brother.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.320
You're disgusting!
Get out of my car!

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:23.520
I told you never
to mention that!

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.960
So, anyhows, the goat killer--

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.880
- Can't we talk about something else?
- No.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:35.240
Whenever he strikes, he leaves
a bloody goat's head next to the victim.

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.240
Isn't that creepy?

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.240
They thought he went up to Stockton,
but two nights ago...

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:44.080
they found the bodies
of Carlie Johnson and Don White...

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.320
right here at this canal
all hacked to pieces.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.080
Who do you think'll take
the regionals this year?

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.680
Not only were there bloody
goats' heads all around...

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.160
but he had switched parts
of their bodies.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:00.680
She had on his arms
and he had on her legs and--

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.440
Wait a second!

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.160
Did you hear that?

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.200
- Doyou think it's the goat killer?
- No!

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:12.560
Listen, I'll go for help
and you stay here.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.240
No, let's get in this field.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.680
Come on, come on!

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.600
Maybe if it's the goat killer, he'll get
somebody and we'll see the whole thing.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.480
I don't want to see
the whole thing!

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.200
I can't see what he's doing.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.840
Darn it,
I wish I could see.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:36.960
I can't see anything.
I don't wanna see anything.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.320
Just keep him away from me.
That's all I want.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.280
How do I get into these things?

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.800
We're all right up--

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.320
Debbie?

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.200
- Oh, no! Please! Please!
- Terry.

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.520
- Steve!
- What are you doin' up here?

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.320
Oh, God, Steve.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.320
Is it safe to come out?

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.520
- Where did you go, anyway?
- Over there.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.160
- Let's get outta here.
- Where's my 'rod?

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.080
- Your 'rod?
- Yeah.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.920
Did I introduce you?
This is Debbie. Debbie, this is Steve.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.800
Well?

01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:26.200
It's in the garage.

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:28.319
I put it in the garage
for safe keeping.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:30.880
I don't want to take any chances
with it.

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:34.160
It's a good thing too,
because somebody stole our car.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:38.279
- That's terrible. What kind was it?
- Where's Laurie anyway?

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:41.479
- I guess we broke up.
- You broke up? Bull.

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.080
Doesn't look like a gearshift knob.
What is it?

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:51.479
- Come on, give it back to me.
- What's wrong? You're a tough guy.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:55.720
Go ahead and cream me.
Break my arm. See if I care.

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.840
I was just gonna keep it
for a little while.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.720
You're an ogre, like my father.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:10.080
He won't let me stay out late,
or play records, or anything.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.000
Your fatherwon't let you
stay out late?

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.920
No, he's terrible.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.479
Once I was out late at a party.
He called the cops.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:21.359
Can you imagine?
He had the whole police force there.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:25.080
By the way,
where is it that you live, Carol?

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.600
Over on Ramona. Why?

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:32.359
Oh, no! You thought I'd tell you
where I live?

01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:35.439
Not me. Not old Carol.
The night is young.

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.000
And I'm not hittin' the rack
till I get a little action.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.439
What do you keep lookin' at?

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.560
Who's that? You know him?

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:47.080
- He's followin' awful close.
- Grab on to something.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.040
Hey, man, I'm sorry
if I scared ya.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:03.640
You'd have to do a hell of a lot
more than that to scare me.

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:06.840
I been lookin' all over for ya.
Didn't nobody tell you?

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:10.520
I can't keep track of all you punks
runnin' around here backwards.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.760
You're supposed to be
the fastest thing in the valley.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.640
But that can't be your car.
It must be your mama's car.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.440
I'm sort of embarrassed
to be this close to you.

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:21.240
I'm not surprised,
drivin' a field car.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.200
Field car?
What's a field car?

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.280
A field car runs through the fields,
drops cow shit all over the place.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.080
That's pretty good.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.080
I like the color of your car, man.
What's that supposed to be?

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:35.600
A cross between piss yellow
and puke green, ain't it?

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:38.000
You call that a paint job,
but it's pretty ugly.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:42.040
I'll bet you gotta sneak up on the pumps
just to get a little air in your tires.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:45.560
At least I don't have to pull over
to the side just to let a funeral go by.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.920
Funny. You know what?

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.360
Your car's uglier than I am!

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.400
That didn't come out right.

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.520
Come on, boy.
Let's go. Prove it.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.800
Why don't you go out and try
to win yourself a few races?

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.480
Then you come on back
and I'll show you a few things.

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.840
Race him. You can beat him.

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.360
That's a tough-lookin' girl
you got with you, man.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.640
Tryin' to pick up
a few extra bucks baby-sittin'?

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:15.600
Doll, come and ride with me--
in about ten years!

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.800
Leave her out of this.
This is between you and me.

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.960
He's really fast, isn't he?

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.920
Yeah, but he's stupid.

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.080
Any of you guys know a blonde
in a white T-Bird?

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.000
I know her.
What about it?

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:49.800
I'm tryin' to find out who she is.

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.480
She's out of your price range, man.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:56.040
- My brother's been out with her.
- Price range?

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.160
Are you trying to tell me
she's a prost--

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.960
That's right, she's a $30 Sheri.
Can you imagine that?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.080
- Thirty bucks for that broad.
- We're thinkin' about different broads.

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.680
Watch it. Fuzz ahead.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.200
- Where?
- AtJerry's Cherry.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.480
You can barely see the fender.

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.720
Yeah. We oughta do somethin'.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:18.320
I got an idea.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.240
I got a good idea.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.320
I think I'm gonna
go over to Burger City.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.800
Yeah, Laurie's probably over there.

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.600
You think she's got me
worried about where she is, don't you?

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.960
I couldn't care less.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.880
- Want to come along?
- Yeah, I do.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.000
- No.
- Make up your minds.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.280
No, thanks.
We got to report the car missing.

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.720
All right. I'll see ya.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:46.000
Shut up! They'll hear us.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.080
- Listen, Carl--
- Curt.

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.360
Despite you scratchin' Gil's car,
I like you.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.960
And I know what you'd like
more than anything right now.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.560
Like every guy in this town, you got
the same secret dream, right?

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.080
You wanna be a Pharaoh.
Go ahead. You can admit it.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.640
But you didn't think
it was possible, did you?

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:16.320
Well, tonight...

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:19.240
I'm gonna give you your chance.

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:41.840
Get down.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.800
Okay. Now, you got it?

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.800
- I'm stayin' here. You're on your own.
- Wait a minute, Joe.

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.080
- What if he hears me?
- Listen, listen!

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.600
Look at it this way.
You got three choices.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.600
One, you chicken out.

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.400
In that case, I let Ants tie you
to the car and drag you around a bit.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.320
- You don't want that, right?
- No.

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:06.320
Two, you foul up
and Holstein hears you, and, well--

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:09.000
- You don't want that, right?
- No, I don't.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:13.680
Three, you are successful
and you join the Pharaohs...

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.360
with a car coat and
a blood initiation and all that.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:20.280
Wait a minute.
What blood initiation?

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.720
Why don't we go get your Jeep?

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:07.600
- What are you talking about?
- Your Jeep.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:12.080
The one you sold the hunting ponies for.
The one with the four-wheel drive.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.240
You sure you got
enough slack?

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.320
Yeah, no sweat.
Let's get outta here.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.920
Come on, Terry.

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.160
Stand by for justice!

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.680
I can't believe it.

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:52.600
Feeling so good
'cause you're 16.

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.040
Ooh, you come on
like a dream

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:03.840
Peaches and cream
Lips like strawberry wine

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.640
You're 16

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:09.200
You're beautiful
and you're mine

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.880
Why are we stopping here?

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:16.480
- Carol.
- What?

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.520
I don't think that I can
control myself any longer.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:27.200
- You can't?
- I've got to have you.

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.200
Me?

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.560
All night you've been sitting there
and you've been so sexy...

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:34.320
and it's been so hot out here...

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.360
and I can't wait any longer.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.160
A lot of that
was an act, you know.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:43.040
Like my crying.
That was just an act.

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.920
It's been building up inside of me
like a volcano all night.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.400
If you told me where you lived,
then I could take you home...

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.520
but you won't tell me where you live,
so here we are.

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:57.040
I mean, I've got to have you.
It's too late.

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.600
It's not too late.
It's never too late!

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:02.000
231 Ramona. Two-three-one.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.560
I'll show you.
It's easy to find.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.600
Hi, Steve.
Mind if I sit down?

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.320
No. Have a seat.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:20.480
Just got five minutes off
and I saw you all alone...

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.640
for once.

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:25.640
- Where's Laurie?
- I don't know.

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:28.400
I thought you guys'd be together,
this being your last night.

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:30.800
- We broke up.
- What?

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:33.520
- It's no big deal.
- What happened?

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.600
Budda, you got an hour left.
Let's get on it.

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.400
All right, all right,
you old fart! Relax!

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.440
Listen.

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:45.360
I'm off in an hour, and I thought
you'd maybe like to come over.

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.440
- I don't know.
- Well, why not?

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.800
This time it'd just be for fun.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.680
Okay?

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:18.960
Okay.
I'll see you later, then.

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.760
Budda, wait.

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:26.240
Listen, I--

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.360
I gotta get up early in the morning
and I don't think it'd work out.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.800
I tell you somethin'.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.880
That thing jumped about
five feet in the air--

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.760
Listen, I still gotta find
that blonde.

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:00.880
Anyway, we'll catch you tomorrow.

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.560
I guess so. I don't know.

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.520
What do you mean,
you guess so?

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.320
We don't admit a lot of guys
to the Pharaohs.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:10.280
We got to steal your car coat,
things like that.

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.200
You gotta
make up your mind.

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:15.920
Rome wasn't burned
in a night.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.080
- Let's go!
- I'll see you, boys.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:52.120
You only got about five minutes
if you want to talk to the Wolfman.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:55.760
Gonna make all your dreams
come true, baby. Hello!

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:59.600
Would you dedicate a record
to keep me and my girlfriend together?

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:02.640
-Are you separated?
- We're havin' a little problem.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.360
I'll bring you right together.
Hold on a minute, man.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.360
Everything's gonna be
allright now, man, understand?

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:15.600
I chased the evil spirits away.
Now let me play the record for ya.

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.320
Hey, baby.
What do you say?

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:24.080
Don't say anything
and we'll get along just fine.

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.640
This is the first time
you've been quiet all night.

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:38.240
I had fun. Good-bye.

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:40.680
Bye.

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:46.320
- Do you like me?
- Yeah, I like you. You're all right.

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:48.080
But I mean do you like me?

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.080
I like you.

01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.440
Okay?

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:03.200
Couldn't I have something
to remember you by?

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:21.160
- Bye, kid.
- Gee, thanks!

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.720
It's just like a ring or something.
It's like we were going steady.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.000
Wait'll I tell Marcia
and everybody!

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:30.280
- Don't go overboard with this thing.
- I'll see you around.

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:47.120
I haven't cried so much.
Tears and everything, man.

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:50.640
I leaned towards the microphone,
I almost shorted myself out!

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:51.560
I leaned towards the microphone,
I almost shorted myself out!

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:55.840
- Hold that up.
- You're right about that.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:59.600
But why should I leave home
to find a home?

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:02.680
Why should I leave friends that I love
to find new friends?

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.880
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
I've heard this already.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.400
Aren't you the one that told me
for eight weeks...

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.640
that you have to leave
the nest sometime?

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.560
I realize that.

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:15.120
No "realizing".
You've been telling me all summer...

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:18.480
that it's time to stick your head
out of the sand...

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:22.080
and take a look at the big,
beautiful world out there somewhere.

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:25.120
Gimme this thing.
I feel like a midwife.

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:27.120
I may have been wrong,
Curt.

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.520
Wrong, nothing!
You've been telling me for eight weeks.

01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:31.760
- Goddamn it.
- Yeah, I know.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.840
You're just mentally
playing with yourself.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.640
Just relax and we'll talk about it
at the airport.

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:40.080
Where're you going?

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.560
It's awfully early in the morning.

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:45.080
- I have a dental appointment.
- Come on, Curt.

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:48.600
Just relax, will ya?
I'll see you at the airport.

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:02.040
Some enchanted evening

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:06.000
You will see a stranger

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:09.280
You will see a stranger

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:13.680
Across a crowded room

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:16.880
And suddenly you'll know

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.280
That she is the one

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:33.280
- He mustn't have been used to drinking.
- No. He likes to drink. He told me so.

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.520
I knew a man once
who got that sick.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.640
Billy Weber.
That was ten years ago.

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:47.600
On his hands and knees like that
he looks like a dog, like old Ginger.

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:50.800
Sicker'n a dog,
that's for sure.

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:58.760
- Are you all right?
- Oh, rats.

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:02.000
I feel terrible.

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:09.560
The car!
Debbie, look!

01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:12.160
Debbie, that's the car!

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.320
Look. It's sitting right here.

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:20.360
- Are you sure this is it?
- Yeah, sure. This is it.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.040
They must've taken
the keys with 'em.

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.800
- Maybe we better go call the police.
- No. Wait a minute.

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:32.160
I got a better idea.
We'll just steal it back, all right?

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.960
You get some wire-- about a foot.
We can hot-wire it.

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:55.920
Took the header plugs off?
Expectin' some action?

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:58.880
Yeah, I think so.
There's some punk lookin' for me.

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:02.480
Why the hell do they bother?
You've always been number one.

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.920
Been a long time, ain't it?
I'll see you. Thanks.

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.840
Hi, this is my car.

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:33.280
What I mean is,
somebody stole--

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.480
No, I mean, I lost my car, see?

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:38.600
And I want to thank
you two guys for retur--

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:41.800
I mean, now listen.
Now, listen, guys.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:46.280
I've been sick, and this kind of
activity can really be hard on a guy.

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:48.440
Easy. Easy.

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:53.680
Stop it! Stop it!

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:58.120
Help! Police! Help!

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.880
Stop it, you creeps!

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:21.520
- Go, John!
- Get him!

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.480
Come on, get up!
Come on!

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.200
What the hell's
going on here, Toad?

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.120
Man, are you all right?

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.800
Yeah, I'll die soon
and it'll all be over,John.

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.240
Wow, you're just
like the Lone Ranger!

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:42.520
Listen--
Are you with him?

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.960
You're talking
to the woman I love.

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.840
What happened, man?

01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:59.440
- Hi, Steve.
- Hi,Judy. Hi, Karen.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.360
Where's Laurie?

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:05.560
We know where she is.

01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:07.520
So what?

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:08.880
So nothing.

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:11.480
It's just that she was
with a really cute guy...

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.600
in a really boss car.

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.400
And we thought you just
might know who it was.

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:20.520
- I'm sorry, but I wouldn't know.
- We know.

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.480
His name's Bob Falfa.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.800
Bring two cherry Cokes
with lots of ice.

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:37.480
No, never mind.
Just bring the ice. Pronto.

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.200
Out! Out!
Get out of the car.

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:41.320
Steve, what are you doin'?

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.760
Just get out and shut up.
You too. Get out. Get out!

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.760
- What's going on?
- I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:56.440
I can't believe it.

01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.720
You practically get killed
trying to get your car back...

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.600
then you let him have it.

01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:03.000
It's not my car.

01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.240
What?

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:07.120
It is not my car.

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.320
Well, then,
where is your car?

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.000
I don't have a car.

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:17.120
What about your Jeep?

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:20.080
How am I gonna get home?

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:27.920
Where's your car?
I have to hang 'em on a car.

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.640
I need a ride.

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:37.360
Toad, what happened to you?
Did you lose your car again?

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.600
No, Steve took it.

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.880
I want to go to sleep.

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:46.560
You got to take it easy
when you drive that car of yours.

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:49.000
You've got to cruise easy,
baby.

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:52.640
Don't be doin' any accidents
or anything on me now.

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:54.800
You know, Terry?

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.800
I had a pretty good time tonight.

01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:59.800
- Come on. You're just--
- No, no. Really, really.

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:02.000
I really had a good time.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:05.280
I mean, you picked me up
and we got some hard stuff...

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:08.480
saw a hold up
and then we went to the canal.

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:10.760
You got your car stolen.

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:13.480
And then I got to watch you
get sick.

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:16.720
Then you got
in this really bitchin' fight.

01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:20.120
I really had a good time.

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:23.680
Well, I guess I have a pretty good time
just about every night.

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.120
If I'm not doing
anything tomorrow...

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:29.080
why don't you give me
a call, okay?

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.000
Yeah, all right.

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:33.920
I got a little Vespa I play around with.
Maybe, you know--

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.520
Really?
Well, that's almost a motorcycle...

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:39.360
and I just love motorcycles.

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:41.760
You do?
Why didn't you say something earlier?

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.640
We wouldn't have had
to go through all the fun.

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:46.480
I gotta go.

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:53.080
- Good night.
- See ya.

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:56.480
Hey, what do you want?

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:59.280
Push the red switch down.

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:05.040
I'm looking for this girl.

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:07.440
Yeah. Aren't we all?

01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:09.360
She's not here.

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:12.560
Come on in the back.

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:15.800
You just go around the back.
This way.

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:30.320
Have a popsicle. The ice box just
broke down and they're melting.

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:32.280
- You want one?
- No, no, thanks.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:35.200
- Listen--
- Have a popsicle.

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:37.040
Are you the Wolfman?

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.240
No, man.
I'm not the Wolfman.

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:45.040
Wait a minute.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:55.840
Who is this
on the Wolfman's telephone?

01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:59.520
That's the Wolfman.

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:00.960
He's on tape.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.360
The man is on tape.

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:08.280
Where is he now?
I mean, where does he work?

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.440
The Wolfman is everywhere.

01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:16.120
I gotta give him this note.
Shit!

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:21.520
Here, let me see the note.

01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:29.480
Hell, that's just a dedication, man.
What I can do is relay it.

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:33.680
- It'll be on tomorrow or Tuesday.
- No, no, this is very important.

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:36.720
I may be leaving town
tomorrow and it's very important...

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:40.720
that I reach this girl right now.

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.840
You don't know whether
you're going to leave town or not?

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:47.440
I'm supposed to go to college
back east tomorrow.

01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:50.960
And I don't know
if I'm going to go. I don't know.

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:54.800
Wait a minute.
Have a popsicle.

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.920
- No, thanks.
- Sit down a minute.

01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:00.120
- It's early in the morning.
- Damn.

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.200
I can't talk
for the Wolfman...

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.520
but I can tell you one thing.

01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:10.160
If the Wolfman was here,
he'd say, "Get your ass in gear".

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.840
The Wolfman comes in here
occasionally...

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:17.160
bringing tapes, you know,
to check up on me and what not.

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.760
And the places he talks about
that he's been...

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.680
the things he's seen.

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:24.840
It's a great big beautiful world
out there.

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.600
And here I sit...

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:30.760
sucking on popsicles.

01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:32.480
Why don't you leave?

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.320
I'm not a young man anymore.

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:40.000
The Wolfman gave me my start
in the business, and I like it.

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:42.440
I tell you what.

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.880
If I can possibly do it tonight...

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.560
I'll try to relay
this dedication in...

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.880
and get it on the air
for you later on.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000
That would be terrific.
Really. Thanks.

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:55.800
Just a minute.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.720
- It's been a pleasure, really.
- Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:03.360
Sticky little mothers, ain't they?

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.280
Six or seven of them, right?

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:08.080
I know. I got a whole
refrigerator full.

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.400
- Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
- See you later.

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:20.720
Rock on, baby.
We gonna do it right here.

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.800
Rock 'n' roll
yourself to death.

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.920
Oh, mercy!

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.520
Give me some more!
My, my.

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:43.120
John, let me go with you.
Come on.

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.080
Nah, man, I can't take you
when I'm racin' somebody.

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:51.480
Just let me go. I just want to watch.
Or I'll fag you, okay?

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.200
All right. Go ahead.

01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:59.600
Paradise Road.

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:06.480
Where's this Paradise Road?

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:09.840
Just follow this street
straight out of town.

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:14.160
If you're going to race John Milner,
let me out when we get there.

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:18.320
Why don't you shut up, baby?
You ain't said one word all night long.

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:20.080
You're a weird broad.

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.960
But you're gonna
appreciate me soon.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.520
You'll be hanging on for mercy
when I get this sucker rollin'.

01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:40.560
Paradise Road?

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:43.240
Some guy named Falfa's
goin' up against Milner.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:45.520
- He's racing Falfa?
- Yeah.

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:49.840
Figured something's up. Saw 'em head
out of town real cautious-like and--

01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:00.200
I got a dedication here
for a friend of the old Wolfman.

01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:02.400
He wants me to play
the next song...

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:05.320
for a blonde young lady
in a Thunderbird.

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:07.800
A white T-Bird,

01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:11.200

and he wants to talk to you, baby.

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:13.600

He's a friend of mine, you hear?

01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:22.640
Little girl, you better call him

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:52.240
Laurie, what in the hell

01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:55.440
- Is she gonna ride with you?
- Mind your own business,John.

01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:59.280
Yeah, she's going with me.
You take care of yourself, man.

01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:01.440

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:50.880
You son of a bitch!

01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:05.040
Come on, she's gonna blow.

01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:07.960
I don't know.
Please, don't come near me.

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:09.840
I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, Steven.

01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.600
Oh, Steven!
Please don't leave me.

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.640
- Don't leave me, please.
- I won't.

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:23.760
I couldn't bear it.
Please.

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:25.680
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:27.760
- I'm not gonna leave you.
- Promise me.

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.520
- I promise.
- Do you?

01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:33.400
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:48.560
That was beautiful, John.
Just beautiful.

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:53.560
- I was losin', man.
- What?

01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:58.640
He was pulling away from me
just before he crashed.

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:02.800
You're crazy! You creamed him
from right off the line.

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:05.680
Shit, Toad! The man had me.
He was beatin' me.

01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:08.080
John, I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:10.480
It was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:13.520
He might as well get a wheel chair
and roll himself home.

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.920
Man, you got the bitchinest car
in the valley.

01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:18.760
You'll always be number one.
You're the greatest.

01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.400
Look at your glasses, man.

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:30.640
Okay, Toad.

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:33.000
We'll take 'em all.

01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:35.760
- All right.
- We'll take 'em.

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.880
Let's get out of here.

01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:39.800
Jesus, what a night!

01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:20.240
- Curt?
- Yes! Yes. This is Curt.

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:24.080
- Who are you?
- Who were you expecting?

01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:27.120
- Do you drive a white T-Bird?
-A white '56.

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.040
I saw you on Third Street.

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:32.560
Who are you?
Do you know me?

01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:34.360
Of course!

01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:37.720
- How do you know me?
- It's not important.

01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:40.440
It's important!
It's important to me.

01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:43.600
You're the most beautiful, exciting
thing I've ever seen in my life...

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:45.800
and I don't know anything
about you.

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:48.800
Listen, listen--

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:52.080
- Could we meet some place?
- I cruise Third Street.

01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:54.480
Maybe I'll see you tonight.

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:56.520
No, I don't think so.

01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:59.640
Tell me your name!
At least tell me your name!

01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:02.040
- Good-bye, Curt.
- Wait a minute!

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:07.440
Little kiss on your ear.
Goodnight, sweet heart.

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:09.560
I'll see you later.

01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:12.080
Oh, The Spaniels.

01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:22.560
Good-bye, son.
Call us when you get there.

01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:28.840
I'll miss you.

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:34.760
Good luck.

01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:37.040
Same to you.

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.680
- Am I gonna see you there next year?
- I'll be there.

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:48.240
Bye-bye, Curt.

01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:56.480
Stay cool, man.

01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:00.440
And don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:02.880
I'll see you, buddy.

01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:09.320
You probably think you're a big shot
going off like this.

01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:12.560
But you're still a punk.

01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:14.760
Okay, John.

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:18.320
- So long.
- So long!

01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:25.720
Have a good trip.
