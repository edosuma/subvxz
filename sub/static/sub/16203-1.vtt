03:39.223 --> 03:41.824
<i>Southern
Airways flight 49 has arrived</i>

03:41.926 --> 03:43.492
<i>at Memphis International Airport,</i>

03:43.594 --> 03:45.361
<i>gate 11.</i>

03:45.463 --> 03:48.464
It's gotta have some
type of meaning, you know?

03:48.566 --> 03:51.100
I'm not sure you're
gonna find what you're looking for

03:51.202 --> 03:53.669
in a Memphis airport gift shop, Mac.

03:53.771 --> 03:55.704
Gotta take what you can get.

03:55.807 --> 03:59.208
I'll find it.

03:59.310 --> 04:01.410
I still think this
whole thing's a bad idea.

04:01.512 --> 04:03.078
Yeah? Why?

04:03.181 --> 04:05.614
Coming home a day early, thinking
you're surprising your wife.

04:05.716 --> 04:07.950
How could that possibly go wrong?

04:08.052 --> 04:09.952
What you mean? Man, you don't
know what you talking about.

04:10.054 --> 04:12.588
Heh, I know a year's a
long damn time to be away.

04:12.690 --> 04:14.446
You're liable to end
up surprising yourself,

04:14.481 --> 04:15.225
finding some jackass

04:15.260 --> 04:17.594
flopping around on top of her.

04:17.661 --> 04:20.863
All right, so I guess you think
Ruth cheated on you, too, you know?

04:20.964 --> 04:23.265
She sure as hell better not have.

04:23.367 --> 04:25.768
Yeah, there goes that
sense of romance?

04:25.870 --> 04:28.037
<i>Nah, man, left most
of that in Saigon.</i>

04:28.139 --> 04:30.339
Hey, you think flowers are too corny?

04:30.441 --> 04:32.508
Always go with flowers.

04:32.610 --> 04:34.343
Now, listen to the ladykiller here.

04:34.445 --> 04:36.846
He might be onto something.

04:36.948 --> 04:39.782
- Trust me.
- Okay, thanks.

04:39.884 --> 04:44.186
- You ready?
- No, not yet.

04:51.829 --> 04:54.630
<i>Look at that sad little man.</i>

04:54.732 --> 04:56.799
It sure takes a
lot for you to get laid.

04:56.901 --> 04:59.935
"Coming home" pussy is
like "lunar eclipse" pussy.

05:00.037 --> 05:01.099
Ain't gonna happen again

05:01.134 --> 05:02.638
for me in my lifeti...

05:02.673 --> 05:04.540
hey, there she is!

05:04.642 --> 05:06.141
Hey, come here, baby.

05:18.523 --> 05:20.723
- Finally.
- Yes.

05:20.825 --> 05:24.927
If I didn't know no better, I'd
think somebody missed me.

05:26.497 --> 05:29.698
I didn't forget my "white
husband." Come here.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.635
- How you doin', Miss Ruth?
- You brought him home to me.

05:32.737 --> 05:35.170
I did. Trust me, it wasn't easy.

05:35.273 --> 05:37.306
Hey, did you, talk to Joni?

05:37.408 --> 05:39.341
I did. She doesn't suspect a thing.

05:39.443 --> 05:40.609
She thinks we're coming here
tomorrow to pick y'all two up.

05:40.711 --> 05:42.011
That's my girl.

05:42.113 --> 05:44.079
I got something for you.

05:44.181 --> 05:45.447
- My.
- Yeah.

05:45.550 --> 05:48.083
Plucked fresh from the
banks of the Mekong River.

05:48.185 --> 05:50.486
Wow, aren't I a lucky lady?

05:50.588 --> 05:51.374
Come on, let's go.

05:51.423 --> 05:53.756
Wait. There's something
y'all need to know.

05:53.824 --> 05:55.157
Um...

05:55.259 --> 05:58.260
y'all have any other
c-clothes you can change into?

06:01.566 --> 06:03.966
<i>Reporting from Memphis Airport,</i>

06:04.068 --> 06:05.334
<i>a not-so-welcome
home</i>

06:05.436 --> 06:07.069
<i>for Lance Corporal Arthur Solomon</i>

06:07.171 --> 06:09.705
<i>and Sergeant Mac Conway,
two local Marines</i>

06:09.807 --> 06:11.941
who were implicated, but ultimately cleared

06:12.043 --> 06:13.776
in the supposed Quan Thang Massacre

06:13.878 --> 06:14.810
earlier this year.

06:26.157 --> 06:29.258
Hey! Look at the bags! It's them!

06:29.360 --> 06:33.629
Shooting babies make you feel like a
fucking man, you fascist piece of shit?!

06:46.377 --> 06:49.211
Quan Thang! Quan Thang!

09:49.467 --> 09:51.861
What the hell did you do
with all my Otis Redding?

09:51.929 --> 09:53.862
Baby!

09:59.336 --> 10:01.436
Baby.

10:04.308 --> 10:07.743
It's almost like you
haven't seen me in a year.

10:07.845 --> 10:10.445
You weren't supposed to
be here till tomorrow.

10:10.548 --> 10:12.714
Well, that's why they call it a surprise.

10:14.451 --> 10:16.919
They're beautiful.

10:17.021 --> 10:19.855
Yeah, well, I got 'em on discount.

10:23.494 --> 10:25.427
Your records.

10:35.906 --> 10:38.073
Seeing 'em just made me wanna listen to 'em

10:38.175 --> 10:41.276
and listening to 'em just made me too sad.

10:43.180 --> 10:45.747
<i>The place looks like shit.</i>

10:45.850 --> 10:48.684
Well, you're home just in time
to help me straighten things up.

10:53.090 --> 10:54.723
What is it? What's wrong?

10:54.825 --> 10:57.192
Nothing. It's just...

10:57.294 --> 11:00.762
it just doesn't seem...

11:02.199 --> 11:04.499
I-I'm sorry, it's...

11:06.604 --> 11:08.470
it's you.

11:08.572 --> 11:11.006
It is, baby. It's me.

11:11.108 --> 11:13.108
Kiss me.

11:41.205 --> 11:44.273
It's okay.

12:27.952 --> 12:29.985
Take this off.

13:59.810 --> 14:01.276
What's taking you so long?

14:08.118 --> 14:09.651
You really home?

14:09.753 --> 14:11.753
I'm gonna pinch you.

14:15.259 --> 14:16.958
<i>So, did you dream of me?</i>

14:17.061 --> 14:18.927
<i>You forgot my face, didn't you?</i>

14:19.029 --> 14:20.762
<i>I forgot your smell.</i>

14:20.864 --> 14:23.331
I got something for you.

14:23.434 --> 14:27.335
- You do?
- I got something amazing for you.

14:27.438 --> 14:29.071
Is it a kiss?

14:29.173 --> 14:32.107
- Later.
- What is it?

14:33.277 --> 14:35.844
All right. Close your eyes.

14:35.946 --> 14:37.846
All right, Mr. Mac.

14:42.453 --> 14:44.219
- Wow.
- Yeah.

14:44.321 --> 14:45.787
This is, um...

14:45.889 --> 14:47.289
The tackiest thing you ever seen?

14:47.391 --> 14:50.425
I was gonna say, "Exactly
what every girl dreams of."

14:50.527 --> 14:53.028
I mean, what do... what
do you think happened?

14:53.130 --> 14:55.831
My man decided suicide by toilet.

14:55.933 --> 14:58.333
I don't know. Poor little guy.

14:58.435 --> 15:01.570
He's got his best bow
tie on and everything.

15:03.607 --> 15:05.774
I figured you could put
it up with your collecti...

15:05.876 --> 15:08.643
wait a minute.

15:09.746 --> 15:11.980
What happened to all your figurines?

15:12.082 --> 15:15.150
- Just needed the space.
- Yeah?

15:21.091 --> 15:23.358
It's very sweet, baby. Thank you.

15:23.460 --> 15:27.395
I mean, you don't have to
have it on display or anything.

15:30.300 --> 15:34.169
No, you know what? I got
the perfect spot for it.

15:34.271 --> 15:37.205
It's the trash, isn't it?

15:39.776 --> 15:41.276
There.

15:41.378 --> 15:43.545
Now you can see it every
time you do the dishes.

15:43.647 --> 15:45.514
Yeah? Every time
<i>I</i> do the dishes?

15:45.616 --> 15:47.716
You heard me.

15:51.288 --> 15:53.955
Come here.

15:54.057 --> 15:55.924
<i>Or what?</i>

15:56.026 --> 15:58.627
You do not wanna know "or what."

16:01.031 --> 16:02.164
No.

16:02.266 --> 16:04.232
No, no, no, no!

16:04.334 --> 16:06.735
- Nope. You know what's gonna happen.
- Please, please, please!

16:06.837 --> 16:08.537
- Yep. Here we go!
- No. No!

16:08.639 --> 16:09.704
- No!
- Are you ready?

16:09.806 --> 16:13.074
No, you son of a...!

16:14.211 --> 16:15.877
Cannonball!

16:49.112 --> 16:51.112
Baby, you okay?

16:51.215 --> 16:53.014
Yeah.

16:53.116 --> 16:56.484
Yeah. Yeah. Never better.

17:07.164 --> 17:09.531
In 1968,

17:09.633 --> 17:12.067
many Americans thought they were voting

17:12.169 --> 17:16.037
to bring our sons home
from Vietnam in peace.

17:16.138 --> 17:18.272
<i>And since then,</i>

17:18.375 --> 17:22.577
<i>20,000 of our sons have come home</i>

17:22.679 --> 17:24.179
<i>in coffins.</i>

17:24.281 --> 17:28.316
<i>I have no secret plan for peace.</i>

17:28.417 --> 17:30.552
<i>I have a public plan.</i>

17:30.654 --> 17:33.755
<i>And as one whose heart has ached</i>

17:33.857 --> 17:38.059
<i>for the past 10 years
over the agony of Vietnam,</i>

17:38.161 --> 17:41.796
I will halt the senseless
bombing of Indochina

17:41.898 --> 17:46.067
on Inaugural Day.

18:06.256 --> 18:08.723
Hello?

18:08.825 --> 18:10.525
Hello?

18:13.397 --> 18:17.232
Hello? Who is this?

18:17.334 --> 18:18.267
<i>...running ablaze
from bombed-out schools.</i>

18:19.303 --> 18:21.102
<i>There will be no more talk</i>

18:21.204 --> 18:25.140
<i>of bombing the dikes or
the cities of the north.</i>

18:25.242 --> 18:29.344
<i>And within 90 days</i>

18:29.446 --> 18:32.681
<i>of my inauguration,
every American soldier,</i>

18:32.783 --> 18:37.419
<i>and every American prisoner
out of the jungle...</i>

18:45.996 --> 18:48.096
- Okay, I see the shot.
- Take a shot.

18:48.198 --> 18:49.564
If I miss, I get a do-over.

18:49.666 --> 18:51.933
Nuh! You already
used your do-over.

18:54.871 --> 18:57.839
All right, gentlemen! Time for breakfast!

18:57.941 --> 18:59.107
Coming, baby!

18:59.209 --> 19:01.309
- It's my shot!
- Gotta take it.

19:02.379 --> 19:03.878
I'm taking it.

19:06.817 --> 19:08.383
<i>Ahem.</i>

19:10.020 --> 19:12.554
<i>Daddy, do you want
bacon in your waffle?</i>

19:12.656 --> 19:14.122
Bacon <i>in</i> my waffle?

19:14.224 --> 19:16.324
I've been crumbling bacon
and putting it in the batter.

19:16.426 --> 19:18.126
They can't get enough of it.

19:18.228 --> 19:20.228
Y'all too fancy for a bowl
of corn flakes and milk?

19:20.330 --> 19:23.264
Don't get all fussy. We
still got some of that, too.

19:23.367 --> 19:25.033
This one's beating me at basketball,

19:25.135 --> 19:27.168
you're putting bacon in waffles.

19:27.270 --> 19:29.671
Go away for a year and
this place goes to shit.

19:29.773 --> 19:31.940
Sorry, sorry!

19:32.042 --> 19:33.608
Look, y'all don't say
them words, all right?

19:33.710 --> 19:36.611
- You ain't in the barracks anymore.
- I know.

19:36.713 --> 19:40.148
Ain't nothing in the
barracks as sexy as all this.

19:42.386 --> 19:44.753
I gotta go. I'm gonna be late.

19:44.855 --> 19:46.888
Sit down and eat something.

19:46.990 --> 19:50.225
I gotta go, Ruth. Do I look like
management material, baby girl?

19:50.327 --> 19:52.460
You look like a giraffe.

19:52.562 --> 19:54.696
- All right, I'll take it.
- Now all this food is gonna go to waste.

19:54.798 --> 19:56.664
Well, my checks ain't coming anymore, baby.

19:56.767 --> 19:59.701
Not gonna let you be the only one
bringing home the waffle bacon.

20:03.173 --> 20:04.239
Wish me good luck.

20:04.341 --> 20:06.040
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

21:16.580 --> 21:17.846
Thank you.

21:17.948 --> 21:20.482
See ya tomorrow.

21:20.584 --> 21:23.451
Go and get that sweet girl to bed.

21:26.556 --> 21:29.123
When I got back from Okinawa,

21:29.226 --> 21:31.459
I asked your granddad
if he was proud of me.

21:31.561 --> 21:34.062
- Know what he said?
- Well, knowing Pop-Pop,

21:34.164 --> 21:36.498
probably something racist.

21:36.600 --> 21:40.368
"Need to get a job." That was it.

21:40.470 --> 21:43.171
Didn't tell me he was proud, nothin'.

21:43.273 --> 21:46.040
Soft touch, your granddad.

21:47.344 --> 21:49.477
Well, Lloyd, are you proud?

21:49.579 --> 21:53.815
I think he needs to get a job.

21:55.986 --> 21:58.620
I'm gonna settle up the tab.

22:02.225 --> 22:03.858
- Here you go.
- It's okay.

22:03.960 --> 22:05.927
No, no, take it.

22:15.372 --> 22:17.272
Nah, I quit.

22:27.551 --> 22:29.350
I'd bring you on if I could.

22:29.452 --> 22:31.553
- I wasn't asking...
- But this economy,

22:31.655 --> 22:33.555
real estate's in the shitter.

22:33.657 --> 22:38.693
There's just nobody
buyin' houses right now.

22:38.795 --> 22:42.363
Well, I'd...I'd like to
see you some now that I'm back.

22:42.465 --> 22:45.099
Maybe I could come over, we could
watch a ball game or something.

22:45.201 --> 22:50.305
Probably be best if you don't
come by the house for a while.

22:54.244 --> 22:59.447
It's just the whole Quan Thang crap.

22:59.549 --> 23:02.450
<i>Saw all that bullshit at
the airport on the news.</i>

23:02.552 --> 23:06.788
<i>All those long-haired hippie
idiots throwing crap at y'all.</i>

23:06.890 --> 23:09.223
Whole thing's got Susan
worked up into a lather.

23:09.326 --> 23:12.060
I told her I'm sure you were
just following your orders...

23:12.162 --> 23:14.462
- D-did you, now?
- You understand about women.

23:14.564 --> 23:17.899
Yeah, well, I thought you'd
understand about war, Dad.

23:29.412 --> 23:31.079
- Okay.
- Where are you going?

23:31.181 --> 23:33.214
Just Joni's got work
early in the morning.

23:33.316 --> 23:34.649
Son...

23:35.852 --> 23:38.286
I just want you to know that...

23:38.388 --> 23:40.722
whatever happened over there,

23:40.824 --> 23:42.690
I'm proud of you.

23:42.792 --> 23:44.626
If your mother was still alive,

23:44.728 --> 23:48.029
- she'd be proud of you, too.
- Yeah, yeah.

23:48.131 --> 23:50.431
Yeah, maybe she'd even
let me come by the house.

23:50.533 --> 23:53.034
- Son...
- No, it's been...

23:53.136 --> 23:55.837
it's been a real treat, Dad.

23:55.939 --> 23:57.739
Thanks for the booze.

23:57.841 --> 24:00.441
Come on.

25:23.660 --> 25:25.259
Don't go stopping on my account.

25:25.361 --> 25:27.929
You want the show, you gotta buy a ticket.

25:34.337 --> 25:36.838
- Beverage?
- No, thank you.

25:36.940 --> 25:39.140
So, anything stand out?

25:39.242 --> 25:42.043
Just that the poor kid never had a chance.

25:42.145 --> 25:44.545
Who's taking direct? Moses?

25:44.647 --> 25:47.048
Karl? Don't tell me it's Karl.

25:47.150 --> 25:50.451
<i>Jesus, I'll do it myself
if it's "Ug-Mug" out there.</i>

25:52.622 --> 25:55.022
I believe I'm gonna take this one.

25:55.125 --> 25:56.624
Well, well.

25:56.726 --> 25:59.193
Boss man rolling up his
sleeves and getting dirty.

26:02.098 --> 26:03.865
I'm glad you approve.

26:03.967 --> 26:05.933
I'll leave you to...

26:06.035 --> 26:08.302
is there a term for
what you was just doin'?

26:08.404 --> 26:11.973
I believe "breathtakin'."

26:49.045 --> 26:50.711
Believe y'all won State that year.

26:50.814 --> 26:53.447
- Hey. You must be Coach Blantz.
- Call me Monty.

26:53.550 --> 26:56.284
Coach Owen spoke real highly of you, son.

26:56.386 --> 26:58.319
Good work ethic, strong character,

26:58.421 --> 27:00.655
- good leader.
- Well, he was a tremendous influence.

27:00.757 --> 27:02.423
Yeah, he's a good man.

27:02.525 --> 27:05.226
And he really seems to be
enjoying retirement, too.

27:05.328 --> 27:09.030
Unfortunately, I think he
gave you some bad intel.

27:09.132 --> 27:10.798
How's that?

27:10.900 --> 27:13.568
We don't currently have an open position.

27:13.670 --> 27:15.369
One of the assistants who was leaving,

27:15.471 --> 27:17.305
they're now staying on
till the end of fall.

27:17.407 --> 27:19.407
Okay, but after that, I mean,
y'all need someone, right?

27:19.509 --> 27:21.943
Well, no, then you're looking at
winter break, so we wouldn't... no...

27:22.045 --> 27:23.444
Okay, but then next year, you know,

27:23.546 --> 27:25.479
I mean, I could find something until then.

27:25.582 --> 27:28.616
I don't think you should count on it.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.720
Look. Listen, okay?

27:32.822 --> 27:35.756
This is something that
I... I know I can do, okay?

27:35.859 --> 27:38.893
That I'd actually be really good at, so...

27:38.995 --> 27:40.895
I can be a volunteer.

27:40.997 --> 27:45.333
Or be an advisor, you know,
until something opens up.

27:45.435 --> 27:48.402
I just don't think you
should count on it, son.

27:49.973 --> 27:51.405
I'm sorry.

27:53.109 --> 27:55.676
Thank you for your time.

28:00.750 --> 28:05.319
Two tours, $156.68.

28:07.423 --> 28:09.523
The "thank you for your service" card

28:09.626 --> 28:11.592
must've gotten lost in the mail.

28:13.129 --> 28:15.463
You'll find a job, baby.

28:15.565 --> 28:16.473
Something better than being
a high school swim coach.

28:16.508 --> 28:18.133
Well, what if I don't?

28:18.201 --> 28:21.235
That's... that's barely
one payment on this house.

28:21.337 --> 28:23.971
And throw in the car and the pool?

28:24.073 --> 28:25.740
You built that pool with your bare hands.

28:25.842 --> 28:27.675
The pool's not hurting us.

28:27.777 --> 28:29.410
My paycheck's not nothing.

28:29.512 --> 28:31.712
Maybe it's just too much house for us.

28:31.814 --> 28:33.180
Hey.

28:33.283 --> 28:35.316
Slow down. You've only
been home a few weeks.

28:35.418 --> 28:37.352
Just let me wear the pants
around here for a while.

28:41.557 --> 28:43.557
Great. Get dressed. We're meeting Andrea

28:43.660 --> 28:46.761
at the theater in 15 minutes.

28:46.863 --> 28:49.897
I think I'm just gonna
stay... stay here tonight.

28:51.501 --> 28:54.201
Why?

28:54.304 --> 28:55.369
Hey, don't you wanna find out

28:55.471 --> 28:57.305
how the apes conquer the planet?

28:57.407 --> 28:59.974
- It'll be fun.
- Nah, I just wanna take it easy.

29:00.076 --> 29:02.910
Okay, then I'll stay, too.

29:03.012 --> 29:05.980
No, no. Joni, Joni, no.

29:06.082 --> 29:07.992
You go. Have fun.

29:08.031 --> 29:10.252
<i>This is because she
didn't come to the party.</i>

29:10.320 --> 29:12.753
No, it's not beca... all right, I
just don't feel like going, okay, Joni?

29:20.496 --> 29:22.163
Hey.

29:24.200 --> 29:26.434
It's gonna be all right.

29:26.536 --> 29:29.103
We'll figure something out, okay?

29:34.577 --> 29:36.911
Pop your lips for me.

29:42.618 --> 29:43.985
- Damn.
- What?

29:44.087 --> 29:48.456
It's just even better than I remembered.

29:48.558 --> 29:53.361
Good. Then you're coming to the movie.

29:53.463 --> 29:56.964
Nah. You go and have fun.

30:13.483 --> 30:15.216
Dead man's float.

30:15.318 --> 30:17.718
A little dramatic, no?

30:19.655 --> 30:23.524
So, a total stranger walks
right through your house,

30:23.626 --> 30:25.659
a house you share with
your beautiful wife Joni,

30:25.762 --> 30:28.496
and look at you. Not worried.

30:28.598 --> 30:30.097
<i>You're ready.</i>

30:30.199 --> 30:31.699
Should I be worried?

30:31.801 --> 30:33.667
<i>Depends on how this goes.</i>

30:33.770 --> 30:36.504
- Joni's...
- Don't worry. Your wife is fine.

30:36.606 --> 30:38.873
She's enjoying a movie with a friend.

30:38.975 --> 30:40.608
See, things here take a turn,

30:40.710 --> 30:43.911
I have a man stationed at the
pay phone outside the theater.

30:44.013 --> 30:46.080
Should anything happen to me,

30:46.182 --> 30:48.983
my man will make sure your wife is...

30:49.085 --> 30:51.519
<i>not so fine.</i>

30:53.256 --> 30:55.256
Understand?

30:56.459 --> 30:58.759
Just a little insurance policy.

31:02.432 --> 31:04.031
May I?

31:04.133 --> 31:06.434
Is it gonna matter if I say no?

31:14.677 --> 31:16.277
You got a glass?

31:36.099 --> 31:39.633
Just the glass there, "Spitz."

31:41.971 --> 31:43.537
You want a drink, too?

31:43.639 --> 31:45.706
You hungry,

31:45.808 --> 31:48.676
'cause there's leftover cake in the fridge.

31:55.818 --> 31:59.587
"Civilization begins with distillation."

31:59.689 --> 32:02.123
William Faulkner said that.

32:02.225 --> 32:04.758
He was a Four Roses man just like you.

32:04.861 --> 32:07.728
Who are you?

32:07.830 --> 32:09.497
What the hell you doin' in my home?

32:11.100 --> 32:13.000
You can call me the Broker.

32:13.102 --> 32:16.170
<i>As to the why...</i>

32:17.773 --> 32:19.740
<i>I got an opportunity for you.</i>

32:36.792 --> 32:39.693
- Okay?
- Amway's not really my thing.

32:39.795 --> 32:41.695
- So...
- Maybe you don't understand.

32:41.797 --> 32:45.633
Maybe... I don't want to.

32:45.735 --> 32:48.802
I'm offerin' you the
chance to make real money.

32:48.905 --> 32:52.506
Right here at home doin' what you
did for Cracker Jacks overseas.

32:52.608 --> 32:54.909
Prevent the spread of communism?

32:57.780 --> 33:00.281
You can research a lot about a man,

33:00.383 --> 33:02.583
but you can't research his sense of humor.

33:02.685 --> 33:04.752
No, son. I provide a service.

33:04.854 --> 33:07.454
People have problems, I provide solutions.

33:07.557 --> 33:09.290
Permanent ones.

33:11.861 --> 33:13.561
Wait, are you... are you asking me

33:13.663 --> 33:15.062
what I think you're asking me?

33:15.164 --> 33:16.897
<i>Depends what it is
you think I'm asking.</i>

33:16.999 --> 33:20.501
My guess is a smart guy like
you, you got a good idea.

33:20.603 --> 33:24.238
What, y'all Mob?

33:27.410 --> 33:30.811
- Y'all CIA?
- You got a preference?

33:32.415 --> 33:34.081
Okay.

33:34.183 --> 33:36.183
Okay, okay, listen...

33:36.285 --> 33:38.385
I hate to ruin your trip,

33:38.487 --> 33:41.188
<i>Mr. "the Broker"...</i>

33:41.290 --> 33:42.623
<i>whatever the hell
you call yourself...</i>

33:42.725 --> 33:45.125
but I'm not interested.

33:50.032 --> 33:52.333
Out of curiosity,

33:52.435 --> 33:56.403
how much a high school
swim coach make these days?

33:56.505 --> 33:59.340
Roughly five grand a year.

33:59.442 --> 34:01.342
You didn't land that gig, did you?

34:01.444 --> 34:03.277
Real pity.

34:03.379 --> 34:05.846
That's 30 grand.

34:05.948 --> 34:08.949
That's six years teaching
pimply little shitheads

34:09.051 --> 34:10.384
how to Australian crawl.

34:10.485 --> 34:13.187
All yours in advance. Take it. Enjoy it.

34:13.289 --> 34:16.223
<i>Buy that gorgeous
wife of yours a car.</i>

34:16.324 --> 34:18.324
Okay.

34:18.427 --> 34:20.828
- And then what?
- Over the next several months,

34:20.929 --> 34:22.396
I'll approach you with jobs.

34:22.498 --> 34:25.099
Each job pays four grand
until you've earned out.

34:25.201 --> 34:28.668
I see. And you'd be the broker.

34:28.771 --> 34:31.639
<i>I'm an agent between
you and my clientele.</i>

34:31.741 --> 34:33.607
They don't know you, you don't know them.

34:33.708 --> 34:36.076
It's all clean. Impersonal. Perfect system.

34:36.178 --> 34:38.012
All you gotta do is pull a trigger.

34:38.114 --> 34:39.652
Something we both know you're damn good at.

34:39.688 --> 34:41.882
Okay, look, look.

34:41.951 --> 34:43.684
Just 'cause you, you know...

34:43.786 --> 34:45.518
you followed me around for a few days,

34:45.621 --> 34:48.054
it doesn't mean you know me.

34:50.259 --> 34:53.226
- Why'd you go back?
- Excuse me?

34:53.329 --> 34:55.963
<i>To Vietnam.</i>

34:56.065 --> 34:58.666
<i>You're drafted, you
serve your country,</i>

34:58.768 --> 35:02.002
<i>hallelujah praise Jesus in
the manger, you survive.</i>

35:02.104 --> 35:04.972
You come back to this lovely
home, your beautiful wife,

35:05.074 --> 35:06.540
your pool.

35:06.642 --> 35:09.610
And then one whole year later, you go back.

35:09.712 --> 35:11.211
<i>Why?</i>

35:11.314 --> 35:13.847
You wouldn't understand.

35:15.384 --> 35:17.251
Bet I would.

35:21.590 --> 35:24.358
I know what happened
to you in Quan Thang...

35:24.460 --> 35:26.627
what really happened.

35:28.698 --> 35:31.532
Leave now. Leave <i>now!</i>

35:35.938 --> 35:37.271
It was war, son.

35:37.373 --> 35:39.039
You do what you gotta do to survive.

35:39.141 --> 35:40.441
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey,

35:40.543 --> 35:42.343
you and your little fuckin' sidekick here,

35:42.445 --> 35:44.578
get the fuck outta my house right now.

35:52.188 --> 35:54.355
You understand it's in
everyone's best interest

35:54.457 --> 35:55.989
to keep this conversation between us.

35:56.092 --> 35:57.925
Yeah, and anything happens to my wife,

35:58.027 --> 35:59.460
it's gonna be in your best interest

35:59.562 --> 36:00.961
to find a deep, dark hole to hide in

36:01.063 --> 36:02.463
'cause I'm gonna come looking for you,

36:02.565 --> 36:05.366
I'm gonna find you and put you in it.

36:05.468 --> 36:07.601
What a waste.

36:08.637 --> 36:11.405
Good luck, son.

36:11.507 --> 36:13.240
I don't think you got any idea

36:13.342 --> 36:15.175
how bad it's gonna be for you out there.

36:23.219 --> 36:25.586
Thanks for the whiskey.

37:09.999 --> 37:12.399
<i>Baby?</i>

37:15.371 --> 37:17.070
In here.

37:26.348 --> 37:28.182
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:28.284 --> 37:32.252
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, great.

37:32.354 --> 37:34.655
Just went for a swim.

37:34.757 --> 37:36.156
That's your engine rack

37:36.258 --> 37:38.325
and your tire changers over here.

37:38.427 --> 37:40.994
Got a hydraulic lift for the cars.

37:41.096 --> 37:42.396
That's Tony.

37:42.498 --> 37:44.031
And this here's the tire room

37:44.133 --> 37:47.801
where we keep used
tires, retreads and such.

37:47.903 --> 37:50.704
And... hey.

37:50.806 --> 37:53.507
Last but not least... air filters.

37:53.609 --> 37:55.909
Now, whatever they
bring their car in for...

37:56.011 --> 37:58.378
transmission, oil change,

37:58.481 --> 38:00.113
can't turn off the windshield wipers...

38:00.216 --> 38:02.216
you grab one of these babies
and tell 'em it's theirs.

38:02.318 --> 38:05.085
They'll wanna replace it in a heartbeat.

38:07.256 --> 38:08.689
They're gonna need one eventually.

38:08.791 --> 38:10.591
Might as well get it from us.

38:10.693 --> 38:12.593
<i>This way. I'll show
you to the break room.</i>

38:57.973 --> 39:01.408
- Man, put that away.
- No, you got the last two.

39:01.510 --> 39:03.076
Come on. Come on, man.

39:03.178 --> 39:05.913
- I got it, all right?
- Man...

39:06.015 --> 39:08.282
Look at this. You're spending
money like you're at a...

39:08.384 --> 39:10.183
Thai whorehouse.

39:17.526 --> 39:19.526
So other than the shit work, the no money,

39:19.628 --> 39:21.862
and being hated in your own hometown,

39:21.964 --> 39:24.164
it's goin' okay?

39:24.266 --> 39:27.100
- Two more rounds, man.
- No, man. No, I can't, I can't.

39:27.202 --> 39:28.869
Look, no, no. Joe... Joe, I can't.

39:28.971 --> 39:30.971
Joni's making dinner. I gotta go.

39:31.073 --> 39:34.207
Make it a round for the bar.

39:34.310 --> 39:36.376
- What are you doin'?
- You believe this?

39:38.047 --> 39:39.980
You risk your life getting blown to shit,

39:40.082 --> 39:42.583
they throw rotten fruit
at you at the airport.

39:42.685 --> 39:44.151
Buy a round of whiskey,

39:44.253 --> 39:46.587
all of a sudden I'm Flip
Wilson to these motherfuckers.

39:46.689 --> 39:49.089
Man, I didn't realize
there was this much pelf

39:49.191 --> 39:51.058
making shitty office furniture.

39:51.160 --> 39:52.626
I thought that's where
you're supposed to be.

39:52.728 --> 39:54.294
Aren't you workin' tonight?

39:54.396 --> 39:55.495
I quit.

39:55.598 --> 39:57.631
What do you mean you quit?

39:57.733 --> 39:58.966
Come on.

39:59.068 --> 40:01.168
I got something I wanna show you.

40:01.270 --> 40:02.669
No, no, no.

40:02.771 --> 40:04.538
No, last time you said
that, it hurt so bad.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.239
Well, I'll spit on it this time. Come on.

40:06.342 --> 40:07.874
Come on, come on.

40:22.558 --> 40:24.758
Pff-ff...

40:24.860 --> 40:28.095
Shit, man.

40:28.197 --> 40:30.964
Look, man, that same asshole
showed up at my place, too.

40:31.066 --> 40:33.000
Yeah, he told me. He said
you weren't interested.

40:33.102 --> 40:34.568
No, I'm not! And you shouldn't be either!

40:34.670 --> 40:36.236
What, don't you see the opportunity here?

40:36.338 --> 40:38.705
To go to prison or die, Arthur, which one?

40:38.807 --> 40:40.340
So killing some Viet Cong,

40:40.442 --> 40:42.209
splattering their heads
like melons, that's okay.

40:42.311 --> 40:44.111
But killing some son of a bitch
who actually deserves it...

40:44.213 --> 40:45.646
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

40:45.748 --> 40:48.181
"Deserves it"? Okay, says who?

40:48.283 --> 40:50.350
Says who, man?! Some
creep with a bag of money?

40:50.452 --> 40:52.886
We're not talking about
preachers and librarians here.

40:52.988 --> 40:55.088
You don't get a contract
taken out on your life

40:55.190 --> 40:57.424
- if you're an upstanding citizen.
- Arthur, Arthur, look, man.

40:57.526 --> 40:59.826
You were somebody over there.

40:59.928 --> 41:02.396
Okay, now you're not and I get it, okay?

41:02.498 --> 41:04.044
Well, you wanna be a
grease monkey all your life?

41:04.079 --> 41:05.166
No, no, I don't, I don't!

41:05.234 --> 41:06.967
But I'm not gonna get
killed under a fuckin' car!

41:07.069 --> 41:09.202
No, you're just gonna die there.

41:10.272 --> 41:12.239
Ruth, Marcus, Lou.

41:12.341 --> 41:15.175
What the fuck you think I'm doin' this for?

41:15.277 --> 41:17.678
If someone's gonna put
this much fuckin' money up

41:17.780 --> 41:19.746
to have you killed,
then you're already dead.

41:19.848 --> 41:21.882
Shit is done!

41:25.087 --> 41:28.155
If it ain't us takin' the money,
it's gonna be somebody else!

41:28.257 --> 41:30.323
Don't you get it, man?

41:30.426 --> 41:31.858
Hey, don't you fuckin' get it, man?!

41:31.960 --> 41:33.994
If you do this,

41:34.096 --> 41:36.363
you are who they say you are.

41:36.465 --> 41:37.864
Come on.

41:37.966 --> 41:40.200
Well, for a $30,000 advance,
I'll be whatever they...

41:40.302 --> 41:41.281
- Come on!
- What the f...

41:41.316 --> 41:44.004
we already are what they say we are!

41:44.039 --> 41:46.006
Where you been?!

41:51.580 --> 41:53.647
Do you feel a fuckin' thing anymore?

41:55.050 --> 41:57.551
One human emotion?

41:57.653 --> 41:59.786
'Cause I don't.

42:03.492 --> 42:05.492
Look...

42:05.594 --> 42:09.196
I'm gonna need a partner, though.

42:09.298 --> 42:11.431
I want somebody to watch my back.

42:14.403 --> 42:16.837
Come on.

42:20.242 --> 42:22.342
No, man.

42:34.256 --> 42:35.856
Beautiful car like this,

42:35.958 --> 42:37.824
regardless whether we do it or you,

42:37.926 --> 42:39.793
you're gonna wanna change it soon.

42:39.895 --> 42:42.562
Yeah, that's fine.

42:43.899 --> 42:45.866
It... it's a '71 fastback?

42:45.968 --> 42:48.435
- It's a Mustang.
- Well, I know,

42:48.537 --> 42:51.004
but a fastback four-barrel?

42:51.106 --> 42:53.173
That right there is one
of the finest muscle cars

42:53.275 --> 42:55.475
Detroit put out in a generation.

42:55.577 --> 42:58.445
Were you in 'Nam, son?

42:58.547 --> 43:01.081
No, sir. I was 4-F.

43:01.183 --> 43:04.551
- So anyway, with the timing belt...
- No, no, it's okay.

43:04.653 --> 43:07.687
- Excuse me?
- I know who you are.

43:07.790 --> 43:09.956
Papers around here.

43:10.058 --> 43:13.660
Quan Thang, right? I didn't believe

43:13.762 --> 43:14.832
any of the horseshit they said about that.

43:14.867 --> 43:16.564
I appreciate it.

43:18.100 --> 43:21.067
Anyway, with the... the timing belt...

43:21.170 --> 43:23.303
There wasn't no massacre.

43:23.405 --> 43:25.238
Media makes us out to be the villains

43:25.340 --> 43:28.141
while the goddamn V.C. are
sending little three-year-old kids

43:28.243 --> 43:29.676
out of the rice paddies with hand...

43:38.520 --> 43:39.886
<i>What the fuck?!</i>

43:39.988 --> 43:42.556
No, no, please!

43:42.658 --> 43:45.125
- Hey!
- Don't!

43:45.227 --> 43:48.094
<i>Hey!</i>

43:48.197 --> 43:50.063
What the hell, son?

43:52.868 --> 43:54.835
<i> It's all right, it's
all right, it's all right.</i>

43:54.937 --> 43:58.772
I... I got it. I...

43:58.874 --> 44:01.641
I got... I'm sorry, I'm...

44:34.176 --> 44:36.309
Everything all right?

44:37.546 --> 44:39.946
You're gonna drip water everywhere.

44:43.485 --> 44:45.185
Okay, so who is he?

44:45.287 --> 44:48.154
Some scumbag private investigator.

44:48.257 --> 44:50.357
And what is all this?

44:50.459 --> 44:53.727
All right, now, somebody comes
in, does a stakeout, right?

44:53.829 --> 44:56.396
They set up a safe house, follow him...

44:56.498 --> 44:59.366
where he's going, what he's
doing, what his pattern is.

44:59.468 --> 45:01.368
Broker calls that the "scout" phase.

45:01.470 --> 45:04.170
We come in, make sure he keeps
on doing what he's been doing,

45:04.273 --> 45:06.273
find him alone, taking a shit or whatever,

45:06.375 --> 45:08.508
and pull that trigger.
That's the "direct" phase.

45:08.610 --> 45:11.678
- Basic recon, execution.
- That's right.

45:11.780 --> 45:13.813
So tell me again why I ought
to be sweatin' my ass off

45:13.916 --> 45:17.017
making shitty-ass office
furniture all night.

45:17.119 --> 45:18.451
So I figure you and me,

45:18.553 --> 45:20.487
we work that 30,000 advance off together...

45:20.589 --> 45:22.188
No. No, no, we don't.

45:22.291 --> 45:25.091
No, we work this four G for
this job and then I'm out.

45:25.193 --> 45:26.660
If that's how you want it.

45:26.762 --> 45:28.628
Yeah. That's... that's how I want it, man.

45:28.730 --> 45:31.331
I... look, I just need a little
bit to keep my head above water.

45:31.433 --> 45:33.466
All right, man.

45:42.577 --> 45:44.010
Courtesy of the Broker.

45:52.054 --> 45:54.220
Hey.

45:54.323 --> 45:56.923
How are you doing tonight?

45:57.025 --> 45:59.259
<i>Think we can hang out later on?</i>

45:59.361 --> 46:03.430
<i>- How about right now?
- Yeah? How about half off?</i>

46:03.532 --> 46:05.231
What am I working with?

46:05.334 --> 46:09.235
Right here. I got this little bad boy.

46:11.540 --> 46:14.641
Yeah? Why you doin' that?

46:14.743 --> 46:16.509
I guess "Dumb Dora" ain't so dumb.

46:16.611 --> 46:18.845
<i>Baby? Come on.</i>

46:18.947 --> 46:21.314
<i>I got two good legs!</i>

46:21.416 --> 46:24.284
Fucking slut.

46:54.783 --> 46:59.753
Well, I've seen enough of this
motherfucker's miserable life.

46:59.855 --> 47:00.854
What about you?

47:00.956 --> 47:02.589
Entrance to the safe house

47:02.691 --> 47:04.391
is that door right across the street.

47:04.493 --> 47:07.394
Okay, wait for my signal.

47:59.114 --> 48:01.347
<i>And we are ready
to start the fourth inning...</i>

48:18.500 --> 48:20.400
<i>And there's the windup</i>

48:20.502 --> 48:23.503
<i>and the first pitch, and
it is a ball, low, outside.</i>

48:29.644 --> 48:31.511
<i>...the strike zone.</i>

48:31.613 --> 48:34.481
<i>Here's the second pitch.
And that's a called strike</i>

48:34.583 --> 48:36.616
<i>right down the middle
of the plate...</i>

48:36.718 --> 48:38.151
<i>one and one.</i>

48:38.253 --> 48:41.654
- <i>It's not a surprise...</i>
- Go, go, go.

48:53.468 --> 48:55.835
Shit!

49:00.041 --> 49:01.508
Fuck!

49:01.610 --> 49:04.277
What the fuck was that, man?

49:08.884 --> 49:12.051
- We should call somebody.
- Yeah.

49:12.154 --> 49:14.053
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

49:14.156 --> 49:16.956
Just... just hand me
a rag or something, man.

50:41.710 --> 50:44.010
<i>Fuck!</i>

53:09.791 --> 53:11.624
Marcus, honey,

53:11.726 --> 53:15.862
you should try and eat something, okay?

53:20.402 --> 53:21.934
Hello?

53:23.872 --> 53:25.972
Mac?

53:26.074 --> 53:28.341
For you.

53:30.712 --> 53:33.713
One of the detectives.

53:37.786 --> 53:39.118
Hello?

53:39.220 --> 53:41.120
<i>How goes it?</i>

53:41.222 --> 53:43.856
<i>I believe we have some
things to discuss.</i>

53:43.958 --> 53:47.093
That's not... that's
not gonna work for me.

53:47.195 --> 53:50.696
<i>I got 30,000 reasons
you wanna make it work.</i>

53:52.066 --> 53:54.300
<i>Tomorrow night, 5:00 p.m.</i>

53:54.402 --> 53:57.069
<i>Limestone quarry, mile marker 97.</i>

53:57.172 --> 53:59.739
- <i>You got it?</i>
- Yep.

53:59.841 --> 54:02.575
<i>Sounds like a date.</i>

54:06.314 --> 54:08.981
- What they say?
- Just setting up a time

54:09.083 --> 54:11.884
- for me to come down to the station.
- Here you go.

54:13.655 --> 54:15.721
- What is it?
- It was nothing.

54:15.824 --> 54:18.991
They were just trying to
work it all... figure it out.

54:20.895 --> 54:23.529
If you know why he was
there that night, Mac...

54:23.631 --> 54:25.264
I... I don't know. I don't know.

54:25.366 --> 54:27.600
I have no idea.

54:30.305 --> 54:32.772
One minute, he's working
a goddamn furniture factory

54:32.874 --> 54:34.373
and the next...

54:34.476 --> 54:37.343
he's dea...

54:37.445 --> 54:39.512
he's dea...

54:39.614 --> 54:41.514
he's dead?

54:41.616 --> 54:44.217
He's dead? He's gone?

54:44.319 --> 54:46.786
One month.

54:46.888 --> 54:50.289
I had my husband back for <i>one month.</i>

54:51.960 --> 54:55.294
- I'll get it.
- No, I got it. I got it.

55:02.604 --> 55:04.103
I'm... I'm...

55:04.205 --> 55:05.972
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

55:06.074 --> 55:08.441
Be right back.

55:26.361 --> 55:29.829
One... one sec... one second.

55:42.143 --> 55:43.776
Thank you all for coming.

56:19.414 --> 56:21.147
Let's go for a swim.

56:22.917 --> 56:24.884
Baby?

56:32.894 --> 56:35.895
I can't find "Otis Blue."

56:35.997 --> 56:37.997
<i>Well, like I said, if
it's not in there, I...</i>

56:38.099 --> 56:39.732
- I don't know where it would be.
- Okay, but could you have

56:39.834 --> 56:42.034
loaned it to somebody? Andrea, maybe?

56:42.136 --> 56:43.803
Okay, calm down. It's in here somewhere.

56:43.905 --> 56:46.405
No, it isn't in there, okay?
I already fucking looked.

56:46.507 --> 56:49.141
Why are you yelling? It's a record.

56:50.912 --> 56:52.945
It's been a tough couple of
days. Let's just go for a swim...

56:53.047 --> 56:56.315
Nothing's where the fuck it was! Okay?!

56:56.417 --> 56:58.417
You have moved everything around!

56:58.519 --> 57:01.621
I'm not the one who decided
to go back to war, okay?

57:01.723 --> 57:03.255
So forgive me for livin' my life.

57:03.358 --> 57:05.758
I'm sorry if your record
isn't in the exact same spot...

57:05.860 --> 57:09.762
- Hey, hey, hey, you know what?! 
- What, Mac?!

57:09.864 --> 57:11.697
Forget it.

57:11.799 --> 57:14.066
I'm sorry, I shou...

57:14.168 --> 57:16.602
I shouldn't have...

57:20.208 --> 57:23.943
I'm gonna...

57:24.045 --> 57:25.578
I'm going for a drive.

57:25.680 --> 57:27.113
Okay. I'll come with you.

57:27.215 --> 57:31.150
<i>No. You stay, okay?
Need to clear my head.</i>

57:31.252 --> 57:35.021
Will you be back for dinner?

57:35.123 --> 57:37.657
<i>Will you be back for dinner?</i>

57:37.759 --> 57:39.425
I don't know. Probably not.

57:39.527 --> 57:42.161
- How long you gonna be gone?
- <i>I don't know, all right?</i>

57:42.263 --> 57:44.130
<i>I don't know.</i>

58:45.059 --> 58:46.826
Put it down!

58:46.928 --> 58:49.762
Put it down, fuckhead! I said put it down.

58:49.864 --> 58:51.897
<i>Easy, easy.</i>

58:51.999 --> 58:54.266
It's goin' down.

58:59.640 --> 59:02.441
Well, color me impressed.

59:02.543 --> 59:04.276
Fuck "impressed," okay?

59:04.378 --> 59:06.445
I just... I want you to leave
me alone, you understand me?

59:06.547 --> 59:08.714
I do, son. I really do.

59:08.816 --> 59:11.517
There's just the tiny matter of the money

59:11.619 --> 59:14.754
that I gave to the dearly
departed Mr. Solomon.

59:14.856 --> 59:16.856
Now, I'm guessin' by the fact

59:16.958 --> 59:20.025
that you're settin' traps and firin' guns,

59:20.128 --> 59:22.495
you ain't got 30,000 to give me, do you?

59:22.597 --> 59:24.563
Hey, why don't I just pull this trigger?

59:24.665 --> 59:27.533
Something we both
know I'm "damn good at."

59:27.635 --> 59:29.235
Because you're not that stupid.

59:29.337 --> 59:31.737
Okay, bullshit! I know
there's just you and...

59:31.839 --> 59:34.140
and Mr. fuckin' Potato Head over here

59:34.242 --> 59:37.009
and a bunch of smoke and...

59:37.111 --> 59:39.545
Leave it!

59:49.056 --> 59:51.991
It's a nice try, Spitz.

59:56.998 --> 59:58.931
"One victim was found dead

59:59.033 --> 01:00:01.567
of gunshot wounds to the throat and chest.

01:00:01.669 --> 01:00:04.103
The other died from asphyxiation

01:00:04.205 --> 01:00:06.739
caused by choking on a cloth sock

01:00:06.841 --> 01:00:10.576
apparently removed from a
prosthetic leg found on the scene.

01:00:10.678 --> 01:00:13.846
The prosthesis belonged to neither victim."

01:00:18.019 --> 01:00:21.954
It takes a certain kind of
man to do that kind of thing.

01:00:23.291 --> 01:00:25.624
<i>Hollowed out on the inside.</i>

01:00:25.726 --> 01:00:28.294
Hard as rock.

01:00:28.396 --> 01:00:30.362
Kinda like this place.

01:00:31.899 --> 01:00:34.266
Maybe I'll call you "Quarry."

01:00:34.368 --> 01:00:36.035
Got a nice little ring to it.

01:00:45.413 --> 01:00:47.780
You know, there was nothing in your...

01:00:47.882 --> 01:00:49.648
in your file

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:51.750
about another guy with Suggs.

01:00:51.853 --> 01:00:54.520
I'm still not clear

01:00:54.622 --> 01:00:56.589
as to why you were there.

01:00:56.691 --> 01:00:58.958
You weren't interested if I recall.

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:02.461
He said he needed a partner.

01:01:02.563 --> 01:01:04.630
Did a bang-bang job on
that one, didn't you?

01:01:04.732 --> 01:01:06.665
Hey, who the fuck are you?

01:01:06.767 --> 01:01:08.968
Who the fuck are you? His butler?

01:01:09.070 --> 01:01:10.836
I told your friend

01:01:10.938 --> 01:01:14.206
to use care and caution.

01:01:14.308 --> 01:01:16.508
Neither of you obeyed those instructions,

01:01:16.611 --> 01:01:19.345
so I really don't see how that one's on me.

01:01:20.915 --> 01:01:23.749
I-I'll come up with the money. I will.

01:01:29.257 --> 01:01:31.857
Or I'll find the guy, okay?

01:01:31.959 --> 01:01:35.394
I'll find... Suggs.

01:01:35.496 --> 01:01:36.962
Killing a one-legged man

01:01:37.064 --> 01:01:38.697
seems to be beyond your reach.

01:01:38.799 --> 01:01:40.099
I got something else for you.

01:01:40.201 --> 01:01:43.535
And then we're square?

01:01:45.006 --> 01:01:46.839
Let's just say it's a start.

01:01:46.941 --> 01:01:48.607
So, what... what are you gonna do?

01:01:48.709 --> 01:01:51.777
You're just gonna keep holdin'
this money over my head?

01:01:51.879 --> 01:01:55.648
I gave your friend $30,000, son.

01:02:04.225 --> 01:02:06.191
Okay.

01:02:06.294 --> 01:02:08.994
Okay, what do I need to know?

01:02:29.717 --> 01:02:31.116
Hey, stranger.

01:02:31.218 --> 01:02:32.851
How'd she like the flowers?

01:02:32.954 --> 01:02:36.522
Who?

01:02:36.624 --> 01:02:39.858
Airport, about a month back...?

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:46.065
- Wait, you?
- Me.

01:02:48.202 --> 01:02:51.236
Well, I sure am glad you're on our side.

01:02:51.339 --> 01:02:54.540
I'd have hated to deprive
the world of all this.

01:02:57.478 --> 01:03:00.245
So, um, you know, Broker...

01:03:00.348 --> 01:03:02.451
the Broker, whatever...

01:03:02.486 --> 01:03:04.884
he said I should see you.

01:03:04.919 --> 01:03:06.919
Call me Buddy.

01:03:24.605 --> 01:03:27.072
So, what did he do?

01:03:27.174 --> 01:03:28.874
Ol' Cliff Williams there?

01:03:28.976 --> 01:03:31.677
He was part of the group that killed MLK.

01:03:31.779 --> 01:03:34.413
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, what?

01:03:34.515 --> 01:03:36.482
Are you serious?

01:03:38.652 --> 01:03:40.586
You are too precious for words.

01:03:40.688 --> 01:03:43.789
No. No, he pissed somebody off.

01:03:43.891 --> 01:03:47.693
<i>Unfortunately for Cliff,
it was the wrong somebody.</i>

01:03:47.795 --> 01:03:49.661
<i>I laid out his pattern
in the file there.</i>

01:03:49.764 --> 01:03:52.331
You just make sure it follows
and Bingo was his name-o,

01:03:52.433 --> 01:03:54.133
you kill him graveyard dead.

01:03:54.235 --> 01:03:56.035
It's easy enough, right?

01:03:56.137 --> 01:03:59.004
Yeah, his "pattern." Okay.

01:03:59.106 --> 01:04:00.305
'Cause, you know, everybody does

01:04:00.408 --> 01:04:02.041
the same predictable
thing every day, right?

01:04:02.143 --> 01:04:03.776
Have you met a human being lately?

01:04:03.878 --> 01:04:05.411
Nothing but predictable.

01:04:05.513 --> 01:04:08.213
I wish the unexamined
life weren't worth living,

01:04:08.315 --> 01:04:11.283
then maybe some of <i>these</i>
fuckers would off themselves.

01:04:11.385 --> 01:04:15.487
Look, I'm not gonna tell you that
we're doin' the world a service here,

01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:18.657
but we're doin' the world a service.

01:04:20.961 --> 01:04:25.264
...for you.

01:04:25.366 --> 01:04:27.533
What is it with y'all

01:04:27.635 --> 01:04:30.235
and these things?

01:04:30.337 --> 01:04:33.038
Well, it's perfect for lonesome travelers

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:34.706
like us, right?

01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:40.345
<i>It's gloves, a new piece,
and keys for your loaner car.</i>

01:04:40.448 --> 01:04:42.514
<i>Now, it's parked downstairs.</i>

01:04:42.616 --> 01:04:44.616
<i>You're gonna leave your Maverick
and take the loaner, okay?</i>

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:49.054
<i>Hey.</i>

01:04:49.156 --> 01:04:51.156
I'm real sorry about your friend.

01:04:54.795 --> 01:04:57.262
- Come here.
- What?

01:04:57.364 --> 01:05:00.566
- Come on.
- Hell no.

01:05:00.668 --> 01:05:03.502
Fine.

01:05:15.916 --> 01:05:18.917
You are a special creature...

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:23.188
and are very much loved.

01:05:30.164 --> 01:05:31.663
What's... what's that for?

01:05:31.765 --> 01:05:35.601
Wouldn't you like to know?

01:06:15.376 --> 01:06:18.443
<i>- No, it sounds good.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:06:18.546 --> 01:06:20.913
These bands break up all the time.

01:06:22.116 --> 01:06:23.682
- Cliff?
- Yeah.

01:06:23.784 --> 01:06:26.285
You've got a message.

01:06:26.387 --> 01:06:27.853
I guess I won't be the only one

01:06:27.955 --> 01:06:30.556
havin' a good time tonight.

01:07:40.494 --> 01:07:41.994
<i>- Hey.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

01:07:42.096 --> 01:07:43.695
<i>What the hell
are you doing here?</i>

01:07:43.797 --> 01:07:46.844
- I got your message.
- What... what message?

01:07:46.879 --> 01:07:47.383
At the club.

01:07:47.418 --> 01:07:50.270
- The one that said "Come over ASAP."
- I didn't call a club, Cliff.

01:07:51.238 --> 01:07:53.171
No, seriously. We spoke about this.

01:07:53.274 --> 01:07:57.009
This is done. You need to...

01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:39.384
You want me to go? I'll go.

01:08:39.486 --> 01:08:43.255
I don't even know when he...

01:08:43.357 --> 01:08:46.124
when he'll be home.

01:09:39.813 --> 01:09:41.580
You knew.

01:09:41.682 --> 01:09:43.915
<i>Of course I knew.</i>

01:09:44.017 --> 01:09:46.852
<i>Why didn't you just tell me?</i>

01:09:46.953 --> 01:09:48.353
<i>Because you
wouldn't have believed me.</i>

01:09:48.455 --> 01:09:51.323
<i>You needed to see it for yourself.</i>

01:09:51.425 --> 01:09:55.460
<i>Do you know how I
managed to survive two tours?</i>

01:09:55.562 --> 01:09:58.163
<i>What I told myself?</i>

01:10:00.167 --> 01:10:04.369
<i>"You only last if you don't care."</i>

01:10:04.471 --> 01:10:08.707
<i>It was bullshit, though. I cared.</i>

01:10:57.558 --> 01:11:00.125
Ahem.

01:11:00.227 --> 01:11:02.727
Jesus Christ. Can I help you?

01:11:04.598 --> 01:11:09.067
Do you know who I am?

01:11:09.169 --> 01:11:12.571
TV or the newspapers?

01:11:12.673 --> 01:11:15.373
Otis Redding records?

01:11:24.017 --> 01:11:28.253
<i>Life's inherently
complex, isn't it?</i>

01:11:28.355 --> 01:11:32.524
<i>- Death isn't.
- Isn't what?</i>

01:11:32.626 --> 01:11:35.060
<i>Complicated.</i>

01:11:35.162 --> 01:11:37.829
Death's just a switch
that gets flipped off.

01:11:37.931 --> 01:11:39.798
<i>You're right about that, Quarry.</i>

01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:42.434
<i>You're absolutely right about that.</i>

01:12:03.257 --> 01:12:05.123
It's done.
