<i>my clean underwear?</i>

18:30.057 --> 18:32.101
<i>Never mind.</i>
<i>I'm good.</i>

Not so much.

18:34.437 --> 18:35.688

18:35.688 --> 18:38.774

18:38.774 --> 18:40.359
Noa.

on the phone for a little.

18:42.695 --> 18:44.655
She's really nice.

18:44.655 --> 18:48.117

the biggest crush on her.

18:48.117 --> 18:49.577
Who am I kidding?
I still do.

18:49.577 --> 18:51.328

18:51.328 --> 18:54.623
‐ A crush?
Like, on her?

18:54.623 --> 18:57.168
‐ What do you guys think?
‐ I think you should knock.

18:57.168 --> 18:59.795
‐ Door's open, so the outfit?

18:59.795 --> 19:01.046
I'm going to meet about a gig

19:01.046 --> 19:03.257
and I wanna look
super successful,

19:03.257 --> 19:05.551
but, you know, I wanna
play it down a little bit

19:05.551 --> 19:07.970
so I don't look
a little too materialistic.

19:10.514 --> 19:12.183
‐ You nailed it.
‐ Yeah?

19:12.183 --> 19:13.559
Thank you.

19:18.147 --> 19:20.065
‐ So do you need
anything else, or...

19:20.065 --> 19:22.151
‐ No.
‐ Okay.

19:29.408 --> 19:31.452
‐ Five uninterrupted seconds
of peace and quiet, maybe?

19:31.452 --> 19:33.394
I don't know.
‐ Oye, don't get snappy.

19:33.394 --> 19:36.396
She gets snappy when
she's hungry. [laughs]

19:36.396 --> 19:39.859

Amy, wanna stay for dinner?

19:39.859 --> 19:41.111
‐ Love to.

19:42.319 --> 19:44.155
‐ Okay.
[laughs]

19:44.155 --> 19:46.949
‐ Yay.
[chuckles]

19:46.949 --> 19:49.785
I love dinner.
‐ [chuckles]

19:49.785 --> 19:52.580
‐ MC Cubano, huh?
That's catchy.

19:52.580 --> 19:53.789
‐ Yeah, you know,
I wanted something

19:53.789 --> 19:56.167
to embrace my heritage.

19:56.167 --> 19:59.044
‐ Well, Vanessa speaks
very highly of you.

19:59.044 --> 20:00.629
You're free the 14th?
‐ 14th?

20:00.629 --> 20:01.922
Yeah, let me check.

20:01.922 --> 20:02.840
You know what?
For you, yes.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.176
‐ Great.
‐ Great.

20:05.176 --> 20:07.219
‐ The music needs to be
profanity‐free obviously,

20:07.219 --> 20:09.221
and include some classics

20:09.221 --> 20:11.807
so the older guests can enjoy it
along with the children.

20:11.807 --> 20:13.184
‐ "Children"?
I'm sorry.

20:13.184 --> 20:15.853
What kind of gig is this?
‐ It's a bar mitzvah.

20:15.853 --> 20:17.897
‐ A bar mitzvah.
‐ Yeah.

20:17.897 --> 20:19.607
Are any of these limitations
a problem for you?

20:19.607 --> 20:21.484
‐ No, no, not unless
you're some kind of hack

20:21.484 --> 20:23.402
who just wants to spin
Justin Bieber songs.

20:23.402 --> 20:27.948
Listen, I'm an artist, you know?
You hire me to do what I do.

20:27.948 --> 20:30.534
Not to censor me,
not to limit me‐‐

20:30.534 --> 20:31.994
to let me rock your world,
you know?

20:31.994 --> 20:33.579
That's why you hire me.

20:33.579 --> 20:36.624
‐ Actually, MC Cubano,

20:36.624 --> 20:39.668
I think that's why
I don't hire you.

20:39.668 --> 20:42.379
MC Cubano.
Vanessa, what are you thinking?

20:42.379 --> 20:44.548
‐ What?
‐ This guy's not gonna work out.

20:47.384 --> 20:50.054
‐ Yeah, that was insulting.
‐ [scoffs] Yeah, it was!

20:50.054 --> 20:51.639
‐ Oh, you're mad at me?

20:51.639 --> 20:52.723
He wanted me to play
a bar mitzvah.

20:52.723 --> 20:54.141
‐ Oh, I'm sorry.

20:54.141 --> 20:55.142
Is high school dance
where you draw the line?

20:55.142 --> 20:56.519
I'll have to remember that
the next time

20:56.519 --> 21:00.147
I ask the head of C. T. O. Records
to hire you.

21:00.147 --> 21:03.317
‐ Weiss?
Eli Weiss?

21:03.317 --> 21:04.985
‐ Yes.

21:04.985 --> 21:07.279
‐ Okay, I can fix this.
Let me just smooth things over.

21:07.279 --> 21:10.282
‐ A steamroller wouldn't
smooth over the mess you made.

21:10.282 --> 21:12.993
Do you want this job?
‐ Yes.

21:12.993 --> 21:15.246
‐ You sure?
‐ Yes.

21:15.246 --> 21:17.581
‐ [sighs]

21:17.581 --> 21:19.416
Follow me
and do exactly as I say.

21:21.669 --> 21:25.256
‐ Melanie, I'm such a huge fan.
‐ Thank you so much, Noa.

21:25.256 --> 21:27.758
And thank you for meeting me
on such short notice.

21:27.758 --> 21:29.677
‐ No problem.
My pleasure.

21:29.677 --> 21:30.678
Can I have a water, please?

21:30.678 --> 21:32.888
‐ Look, I think it's great

21:32.888 --> 21:35.015
what you're doing in Puerto Rico
and around the world.

21:35.015 --> 21:36.934
I'm sorry I can't be
at your event tonight,

21:36.934 --> 21:39.812
but I have this
for your foundation.

21:41.313 --> 21:43.399
‐ This is very generous of you.

21:43.399 --> 21:45.192
‐ I just hope it doesn't
feel like a bribe.

21:45.192 --> 21:46.485
‐ How so?

21:46.485 --> 21:48.487
‐ I have a film starting
production next week,

21:48.487 --> 21:53.284
and I have an actress who just
checked herself into rehab.

21:53.284 --> 21:55.536
It's a small role,
but I've been banging my head

21:55.536 --> 21:57.663
trying to come up with
the right fit for the part,

21:57.663 --> 22:00.583
and I thought of you.

22:00.583 --> 22:03.877
‐ [exhales]
Wow.

22:03.877 --> 22:06.213
Well, I would be very happy
to read for that role.

22:06.213 --> 22:07.798
‐ You don't have to audition.

22:07.798 --> 22:09.633
The part is yours
if you want it.

22:09.633 --> 22:12.177
It's three weeks work,

22:12.177 --> 22:15.639
and we would need you there
in Toronto tomorrow, ideally.

22:15.639 --> 22:18.392
‐ Wait a second.
Toronto.

22:18.392 --> 22:20.769
Is this the film
you're doing with Colin Davis?

22:20.769 --> 22:23.814
‐ Yes, he said
you'd be perfect for it

22:23.814 --> 22:26.233
and that the personal history
wouldn't be an issue.

22:26.233 --> 22:29.361
‐ So is she great,
or is she great?

22:29.361 --> 22:31.614

22:42.333 --> 22:44.084
I thought it'd be all
parties and stuff,

22:44.084 --> 22:45.669
but she spent hours
talking to the press

22:45.669 --> 22:47.254

I mean, I don't know.
She's just a great person.

22:51.216 --> 22:53.093
‐ Well, depending
on how tonight goes,

22:53.093 --> 22:55.429
maybe you'll invite her over
for dinner.

22:55.429 --> 22:57.514

dinners for as long as possible.

‐ What is that supposed to mean?

23:01.185 --> 23:03.020
‐ Okay, I gotta go, Ma.
Bye.

23:03.020 --> 23:05.105
‐ [scoffs] Now we're not
good enough for our son.

23:05.105 --> 23:08.484

23:08.484 --> 23:10.527
‐ I know it's a leap,
and maybe a scary one.

23:10.527 --> 23:12.196
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't think

23:12.196 --> 23:14.323
you and I would make
a great team.

23:14.323 --> 23:16.659
‐ It means so much
to hear you say that.

23:16.659 --> 23:18.077
‐ Just let me know tomorrow,
either way.

23:18.077 --> 23:19.662
‐ Absolutely.

23:19.662 --> 23:21.664
‐ Hey, Colin.
‐ Thanks, Melanie.

23:21.664 --> 23:24.291
‐ How dare you use acting

23:24.291 --> 23:25.918
to worm your way back
into my life.

23:25.918 --> 23:27.670
‐ Wow.
Slow down, Noa.

23:27.670 --> 23:29.630
‐ So this has nothing
to do with us?

23:29.630 --> 23:30.923
‐ Yeah, sure it does‐‐

23:30.923 --> 23:32.299
I mean,
in the fact that I thought

23:32.299 --> 23:33.550
we were still friends, at least.

23:33.550 --> 23:35.678
‐ [laughs]
Oh.

23:35.678 --> 23:37.221
And if I say yes,

23:37.221 --> 23:38.889
then I have to be in Toronto
by tomorrow.

23:38.889 --> 23:41.642
‐ Honey, how are you feeling
about it?

23:41.642 --> 23:43.811
‐ Confused.
‐ For what it's worth,

23:43.811 --> 23:47.481
it's about working with
Melanie Caan, not Colin.

23:47.481 --> 23:51.235
It's about chasing your dream.
I think you should do it.

23:51.235 --> 23:53.779
‐ I hate to admit it,
but I think he's right.

23:53.779 --> 23:55.614
Colin is a side note.

23:55.614 --> 23:57.491
This is a once‐in‐a‐lifetime
opportunity.

23:57.491 --> 23:59.410
‐ Piper, what happened?

23:59.410 --> 24:00.828
‐ Did you fall in the pool?

24:00.828 --> 24:05.541
‐ A water main underneath
the hotel burst, and...

24:07.084 --> 24:09.002
It's a geyser in there.

24:09.002 --> 24:10.838
‐ Well, are they fixing it?
‐ Oh, no.

24:10.838 --> 24:13.424
You don't understand.
It's all ruined.

24:13.424 --> 24:15.217
The food, the decorations‐‐

24:15.217 --> 24:19.388
we have hundreds of people

There is no gala.

24:27.521 --> 24:28.731

24:28.731 --> 24:30.190

24:30.190 --> 24:31.316
‐ No, no, no.
We're not giving up.

24:31.316 --> 24:32.901
‐ Well, what about
another hotel?

24:32.901 --> 24:34.361
‐ Well, it's not about
the space, Lewis.

24:34.361 --> 24:35.779
It's about all the stuff
that we put in.

24:35.779 --> 24:38.115
The food, the decorations‐‐
it's all destroyed.

24:38.115 --> 24:40.826
‐ But still, Noa is right.
We do not give up.

24:40.826 --> 24:44.913
We have two hours to recreate
a meticulously‐planned gala

24:44.913 --> 24:47.291
that celebrates
children and education.

24:47.291 --> 24:48.876
And we're in a predominantly
Catholic country,

24:48.876 --> 24:50.127
so we are due for a miracle.

24:50.127 --> 24:51.378
‐ I got it!

24:51.378 --> 24:52.755
‐ Baker Boy, no offense,

24:52.755 --> 24:55.048

I didn't mean pastelitos.
