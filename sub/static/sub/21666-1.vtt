27:52.547 --> 27:54.128
Here.

27:55.299 --> 27:57.460
You take one, you're wide awake.

27:57.552 --> 28:01.090
You take two, you're gonna wanna
redecorate the house.

28:01.597 --> 28:04.054
And it keeps you trim.

28:04.141 --> 28:05.267
Come on.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.439
So...

28:13.651 --> 28:15.312
-Tonight.
-Yeah.

28:18.322 --> 28:19.528
All right.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.276

You got a brother named Frankie?

28:38.217 --> 28:39.457
Yeah.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.297
Your brother's been very active
in the wire services lately.

28:43.931 --> 28:45.341
How much?

28:45.433 --> 28:48.891
20 Gs, give or take,
plus the interest rate,

28:48.978 --> 28:51.310
which I'll admit is unreasonably high.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.183
It's now 30.

28:53.733 --> 28:55.314
It compounds.

28:55.526 --> 28:57.107
So, why come to me?

28:57.194 --> 28:58.809
Your brother, as limited
a gambler as he is,

28:58.905 --> 29:01.487
he's also irresponsible
in the bargain.

29:01.574 --> 29:02.859
He can't make good.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.195
You, however, you're a working man.

29:18.799 --> 29:21.006
Well, you or your brother's
gonna have to come up with something.

29:23.304 --> 29:26.296
All right, look,
I got a bar I need to tend.

29:26.390 --> 29:29.757

maybe we can talk when it's quieter.

about the color or whatever.

45:27.392 --> 45:28.973
Does he give him the car for less?

45:33.064 --> 45:37.808
Does he pay less than the guy
who comes in, takes forever,

gotta drive five or six cars,
talk about the radio, the whitewalls,

45:41.573 --> 45:44.736

and ready to buy?

No.

two cars for the price of one, right?

say nothing bad about your wife,

1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:55.121
have you two get back together
and have you mad at me forever.

1:01:55.212 --> 1:01:58.045
The marriage is dead.
Say what you feel.

1:01:58.549 --> 1:02:00.005
-Dead?
-Yeah.

1:02:00.092 --> 1:02:02.674
-Like, for real dead?
-Dead dead.

1:02:02.803 --> 1:02:04.384
-100%?
-100%.

1:02:04.471 --> 1:02:06.553
-Never going back?
-The fuck? Yes.

1:02:08.267 --> 1:02:09.552
All right.

1:02:09.643 --> 1:02:11.224
Well, Drea kept her looks,
I'll give her that.

1:02:12.730 --> 1:02:16.473
And considering her brothers
are upstate, her father's a shylock,

1:02:16.567 --> 1:02:19.024
rest of her family's a pack
of fucking scumbag assholes,

1:02:19.111 --> 1:02:20.146
she ain't that bad.

1:02:20.237 --> 1:02:21.226
Uh-huh.

1:02:23.532 --> 1:02:25.488
But if she had as many pricks
sticking out of her

1:02:25.576 --> 1:02:29.239
as she's had stuck in her,
she'd be a fucking porcupine.

1:02:30.915 --> 1:02:31.904
Fuck you.

1:02:32.207 --> 1:02:34.163
FLANAGAN: Still serving, Vinnie?

1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:41.418
-For you, Officer.
-Okay...

1:02:41.842 --> 1:02:43.924
-What are you guys playing?
-What can I get you?

1:02:44.011 --> 1:02:47.174
Gin Rickey? Grasshopper?

1:02:47.264 --> 1:02:48.549
Fuck you. Right.

1:02:52.019 --> 1:02:53.099
How about you?

1:03:02.321 --> 1:03:03.731
You wanna hear about my day?

1:03:03.822 --> 1:03:05.778
Yes, I do.

1:03:05.866 --> 1:03:08.699
-You won't believe it.
-Wow.

1:03:09.036 --> 1:03:10.697
Well, here we go.

1:03:12.373 --> 1:03:14.159
What's happening, baby?

1:03:14.249 --> 1:03:15.580
Have a good night?

1:03:15.668 --> 1:03:17.454
-All right?
-Mm-hmm.

1:03:21.674 --> 1:03:24.040
What you got for me? What you got?

1:03:31.850 --> 1:03:34.512
What is this? Oh, shit!

1:03:36.188 --> 1:03:37.553
It's a Franklin.

1:03:37.648 --> 1:03:39.309
Three-piece suit was easy money.

1:03:39.400 --> 1:03:40.560
Yeah, I guess so.

1:03:40.985 --> 1:03:42.691
Thank you, baby.

1:03:43.362 --> 1:03:45.353
-Ashley, honey...
-Hmm?

1:03:45.447 --> 1:03:46.948
You wanna get a look at this?

1:03:47.032 --> 1:03:48.613
It's a hundred-dollar bill.

1:03:48.701 --> 1:03:50.237
I don't think you've seen
this kind in a while.

1:03:50.327 --> 1:03:52.659
Look here, baby.
Gonna make you nostalgic.

1:03:52.746 --> 1:03:55.579
That ain't funny, C.C.
I've pulled in as much as her tonight.

1:03:55.666 --> 1:03:57.531
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'm just fucking with you.

1:03:57.626 --> 1:04:00.789
-Yeah, can we call it a night?
-Yeah, I'm tired, too.

1:04:00.921 --> 1:04:02.036
Come on, one more each, ladies.

1:04:02.214 --> 1:04:03.624
Up and at 'em, up and at 'em.

1:04:03.716 --> 1:04:04.796
Let's go.

1:04:04.883 --> 1:04:07.169
Before the sun catches us all.

1:04:24.570 --> 1:04:26.106
Who you waiting on, Larry?

1:04:29.283 --> 1:04:30.739
Danene.

1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.457
Keep your eyes on me.
Mind nothing else.

1:04:40.961 --> 1:04:42.701
WOMAN ON TV:
I can bear it so long as I’m near you.

1:04:42.796 --> 1:04:44.957
-Oh, jeez.
-But when / go, will they be quick?

1:04:45.049 --> 1:04:48.086
I know, she's terrified.

1:04:48.510 --> 1:04:51.377
But watch, he's gonna
get her through it.

1:04:52.556 --> 1:04:53.966
Goodbye.

1:04:54.516 --> 1:04:56.017
God bless you.

1:05:03.901 --> 1:05:05.391
She loves him, right?

1:05:07.654 --> 1:05:09.064
Does he know that she loves him?

1:05:18.749 --> 1:05:20.455
Oh, jeez.

1:05:22.377 --> 1:05:24.163
23.

1:05:31.595 --> 1:05:36.055
Nobody loved him until right now,
at the end.

1:05:40.229 --> 1:05:44.643
It’s a far, far better thing
I do than I have ever done.

1:05:44.733 --> 1:05:50.319
It’s a far, far better rest I go to
than / have ever known.

1:06:03.252 --> 1:06:04.742
It's pretty great, huh?

1:06:07.256 --> 1:06:08.837
You ever read the book?

1:06:09.883 --> 1:06:10.963
There's a book?

1:06:21.311 --> 1:06:23.393
FRANKIE: No, no, but you're
an excellent card player.

1:06:24.940 --> 1:06:26.896
Well, no luck so far,
but still excellent.

1:06:26.984 --> 1:06:29.066
One of these days,
you're gonna have all my money.

1:06:31.196 --> 1:06:33.403
Hey, what the fuck?

1:06:33.490 --> 1:06:35.697
So, what'd you do?

1:06:35.909 --> 1:06:37.774
Spit on the sidewalk?

1:06:37.870 --> 1:06:40.202
She tried to purchase
amphetamines over on 10th.

1:06:40.414 --> 1:06:41.529
Oh.

1:06:41.915 --> 1:06:44.497
I needed to stay up
for an exam tomorrow.

1:06:44.585 --> 1:06:46.541
Try coffee next time.

1:06:48.130 --> 1:06:49.245
What are you studying?

1:06:50.966 --> 1:06:53.708
My exam is for Econ,
but I'm an English major.

1:06:53.927 --> 1:06:55.633
You speak English pretty good already.

1:06:55.721 --> 1:06:57.211
You gotta go to more school for that?

1:06:58.348 --> 1:07:00.134
I'm studying literature.

1:07:01.059 --> 1:07:02.560
Like books?

1:07:02.811 --> 1:07:04.051
Mostly modern stuff.

1:07:04.146 --> 1:07:10.062
Um, this semester I'm taking a class
called Existentialism and the Absurd.

1:07:10.277 --> 1:07:12.814
We read "The Stranger."
You know Camus?

1:07:13.655 --> 1:07:15.316
I know Sabu.

1:07:15.407 --> 1:07:16.908
Saw his pictures when I was a kid.

1:07:16.992 --> 1:07:18.448
"Jungle Book," like that.

1:07:19.203 --> 1:07:21.068
Who has time to read a book?

(CLEARS THROAT)

1:07:25.584 --> 1:07:26.824
This your place, Vincent?

1:07:27.794 --> 1:07:28.954
I manage it.

1:07:29.046 --> 1:07:30.206
You asked them to dress like that?

1:07:30.297 --> 1:07:32.538
Oh, that? That's a whatchamacallit.

1:07:32.633 --> 1:07:34.169
Innovation I came up with tonight.

1:07:34.259 --> 1:07:37.342
See, the better they look,
the more tips they make,

anditbnngsin
the suit-and-tie trade into the bar.

1:07:41.099 --> 1:07:43.431
Ever wonder what it's like
for them to be objectified?

1:07:43.518 --> 1:07:45.054
Objecto-who?

1:07:45.145 --> 1:07:46.351
You gotta slow down, kid.

1:07:46.438 --> 1:07:48.394
I'm just a guinea from Brooklyn.

1:07:48.482 --> 1:07:51.019
It means treating a person as a thing.

1:07:51.193 --> 1:07:52.774
Ever wonder
what they think about that?

1:07:52.861 --> 1:07:54.146
I don't know what they think.

1:07:54.238 --> 1:07:55.944
All I know is they made
more money tonight

1:07:56.031 --> 1:07:58.067
than any night in here in months.

1:08:01.036 --> 1:08:02.947
You know, you could do what they do.

1:08:03.121 --> 1:08:05.077
I'd put you behind
the stick in a second.

1:08:05.958 --> 1:08:08.950
I know I could. But would I?

1:08:09.044 --> 1:08:11.581
Right. lwouldn't
want to make you feel

1:08:11.672 --> 1:08:13.879
like, you know, a thing.

1:08:16.051 --> 1:08:17.712
You're smarter than you let on.

1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:20.972
No one's ever called me smart before.

1:08:21.056 --> 1:08:22.796
Not ever, but thank you.

1:08:23.225 --> 1:08:25.011
Christ.

1:08:25.102 --> 1:08:26.387
I'm three sheets.

1:08:27.604 --> 1:08:30.141
You ready to go? I'm ready.

1:08:30.357 --> 1:08:34.316
Um, I think I'll stay here,
have one more.

1:08:34.403 --> 1:08:36.064
I'll get her a cab, Danny.

1:08:36.238 --> 1:08:39.025
Hey, your money's
no good here, Officer.

1:08:46.123 --> 1:08:51.789
You can get me here any time, Abby,
in case you getjammed up or whatever.

1:08:51.878 --> 1:08:55.666
Or, you know,
you just want to talk.

1:08:57.592 --> 1:08:59.548
Thanks for giving me a break.

1:08:59.636 --> 1:09:02.173
That's me, Officer Friendly.

1:09:05.809 --> 1:09:07.094
See you soon, Danny.

1:09:07.185 --> 1:09:08.925
Not if I see you first.

1:09:13.525 --> 1:09:17.734
I think this is what
you were looking for.

1:09:18.071 --> 1:09:21.188
Now, next time, you don't go down
to Hell's Kitchen

1:09:21.283 --> 1:09:23.069
and deal with scum, all right?

1:09:23.243 --> 1:09:25.655
Thanks, but I'm okay.

1:09:25.746 --> 1:09:27.953
The speed wasn't for me.
It was for my friends.

1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:29.450
Don't you gotta study?

1:09:29.541 --> 1:09:31.077
I know that Econ shit inside out.

1:09:32.836 --> 1:09:34.952
Right.

1:09:35.547 --> 1:09:37.253
You know, you should get back.

1:09:37.341 --> 1:09:39.252
It's gonna be light soon.

1:09:39.343 --> 1:09:41.379
Catch the dawn,
you feel like a vampire.

1:09:43.513 --> 1:09:47.472
I think I'll sit here with you
for a little while, if you don't mind.

1:09:50.270 --> 1:09:53.182
Let me get rid of this for you.

1:10:00.030 --> 1:10:02.112
You sure you don't want to do
nothing tonight, Louis?

1:10:02.199 --> 1:10:03.234
Nothing?

1:10:03.325 --> 1:10:05.111
I liked watching the movie
with you is all.

1:10:06.370 --> 1:10:07.826
Nothing?

1:10:07.913 --> 1:10:09.198
Not even a handjob?

1:10:12.542 --> 1:10:13.998
No.

1:10:19.341 --> 1:10:21.002
Uh, listen, Louis...

1:10:23.553 --> 1:10:28.047
I've been up here so long
watching a movie that...

1:10:28.141 --> 1:10:30.598
I'm kind of worried that my man
might get upset with me

1:10:30.685 --> 1:10:33.267

with the usual price.

so he'll be cool with me

1:10:40.904 --> 1:10:42.519
and I'll come past for free next week?

I know about all of 'em.

You ain't fooling nobody.

in some shitty Times Square hotel

-Tell the kids...
-Tell them what?

1:18:12.689 --> 1:18:15.271
Just tell them I had to go.

It's raining, C.C. Raining hard.

I don't wanna work tonight.

why don't we go somewhere
where we can talk about this,

1:19:26.512 --> 1:19:28.298
just the two of us, hmm?

1:19:30.183 --> 1:19:31.639

You'll never make another penny.

1:21:49.822 --> 1:21:51.358

ass-fuck you all over again.
