00:01.784 --> 00:03.003
<i>Previously on</i><i>The white nationalists</i>

00:03.046 --> 00:05.135
<i>who killed Erika,
the Imperial Dukes.</i>

00:05.179 --> 00:06.093
<i>Now, we've already taken
down four of them,</i>

00:06.136 --> 00:07.007
<i>but I can't shake the feeling</i>

00:07.050 --> 00:08.660
<i>that there's more out there.</i>

00:08.704 --> 00:10.401
<i>I went and visited
my mom in hospital today.</i>

00:10.445 --> 00:11.663
<i>Her liver's failing.</i>

00:11.707 --> 00:12.925
<i>She tried to butter me up</i>

00:12.969 --> 00:13.970
<i>to get what she wants.</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:14.971
Which is what?

00:15.015 --> 00:15.972
My liver, apparently.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.104
Or part of it.

00:17.147 --> 00:18.279
What if something goes wrong?

00:18.322 --> 00:20.324
You could lose your job,
or you could die.

00:20.368 --> 00:23.327
When you told me that if you
lost me you'd never recover...

00:23.371 --> 00:25.547
I can't lose you, either.

00:25.590 --> 00:26.852
I mean,
a Black suspect comes at me

00:26.896 --> 00:28.332
with something
looking like a weapon.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.987
Bam! Bam!
Just freed up a prison cot

00:31.031 --> 00:33.250
for someone who
can actually be rehabilitated.

00:33.294 --> 00:34.904
<i>My PBA reps are gonna tear
this case to shreds.</i>

00:34.947 --> 00:36.340
Yeah. They'll put me
back on the street.

00:36.384 --> 00:38.299
You have to watch your back
the rest of your career.

00:38.342 --> 00:39.778
<i>The Board of Rights
reached a decision</i>

00:39.822 --> 00:41.824
regarding Lee

00:41.867 --> 00:44.000
he will not be fired
from the LAPD.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.088
Same for the other two,
Gibson and Ellis.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.263
We just sit here

00:46.307 --> 00:47.612
while a pack of racists

00:47.656 --> 00:49.179
pick and choose who
they're gonna arrest each day?

00:49.223 --> 00:52.008
What you are talking about
is career suicide.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.010
<i>There's gonna be an article</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:55.925
in the <i>L.A. Times
coming out tomorrow.</i>

00:55.968 --> 00:57.796
It'll expose Durham
and his cop buddies

00:57.840 --> 01:00.060
for their racist views
and the department's failure

01:00.103 --> 01:01.539
to take appropriate action.
They'll be printing

01:01.583 --> 01:02.975
my name as the source.

01:03.019 --> 01:04.629
Mayor's gonna have your head
for this.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.457
I know.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.678
Yesterday marked the fourth day
of protests in Los Angeles.

01:09.721 --> 01:13.551
Black Justice Now has led
this latest protest effort,

01:13.595 --> 01:16.163
sparked by last week's
explosive <i>Times</i> article,

01:16.206 --> 01:19.122
where LAPD SWAT sergeant
Daniel Harrelson Jr.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.255
outed the department's
flawed disciplinary system,

01:21.298 --> 01:23.822
reigniting tensions between
the police and the community.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.043
You don't have to
do that for me.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.523
Trust me, I'm not.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.829
I don't need to hear
any more of it myself.

01:30.873 --> 01:33.571
You still getting
flack at work?

01:33.615 --> 01:36.879
People are careful,
but I hear the whispers,

01:36.922 --> 01:38.794
feel the stares.

01:38.837 --> 01:41.362
Not so much from other SWAT
officers, but rank and file.

01:41.405 --> 01:43.190
You know you did
the right thing.

01:43.233 --> 01:47.890
Racist cops don't deserve
a badge, so yeah, I do.

01:47.933 --> 01:49.718
I also knew that
going to the press

01:49.761 --> 01:52.764
would set off a firestorm.
But this...

01:52.808 --> 01:55.680
The anger in this
community goes deeper

01:55.724 --> 01:57.334
than one or two incidents.

01:59.728 --> 02:01.164
I grew up listening
to my father's rants about

02:01.208 --> 02:02.905
the way police in L.A. were used

02:02.948 --> 02:05.908
to keep Black neighborhoods
in check.

02:05.951 --> 02:07.997
That bitterness is old,
and it runs deep.

02:08.040 --> 02:10.521
Exactly. You speaking
out against Durham

02:10.565 --> 02:12.175
and the others, it confirmed

02:12.219 --> 02:13.916
what a lot of folks
already believe,

02:13.959 --> 02:16.745
based on their experience
and on history,

02:16.788 --> 02:18.268
not just your words.

02:18.312 --> 02:21.097
Oh, hey. Uh, sorry.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.055
I didn't know you was having
-company this early.
-It's all good.

02:23.099 --> 02:24.405
Nichelle just stopped by
to check on me,

02:24.448 --> 02:25.580
and she brought some coffee.

02:25.623 --> 02:27.321
Hey, Darryl, want to
join us for breakfast?

02:27.364 --> 02:28.670
No, I'm good. Thanks.

02:28.713 --> 02:32.239
D... what's up?
Everything okay?

02:32.282 --> 02:36.025
My phone's been
blowing up all day, every day

02:36.068 --> 02:38.419
with this Black Justice Now
stuff.

02:38.462 --> 02:41.204
At the garage, all anyone talks
-about is the cops doing dirt.
-Darryl,

02:41.248 --> 02:42.597
you know it's not that simple.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.033
But why shouldn't it be?

02:44.076 --> 02:45.730
You told the truth.
You should be a hero.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.036
And hopefully,

02:47.079 --> 02:48.864
that's how things
turn out, eventually.

02:50.387 --> 02:51.606
My dad said no one ever
cares enough

02:51.649 --> 02:52.694
to really change this stuff.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.827
Maybe he was right.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.232
Thanks for coming in early.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.668
I got a heads-up.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.017
Lee Durham and his buddies

03:12.061 --> 03:13.454
are being terminated,
effective today.

03:13.497 --> 03:16.065
What changed between now
and the first investigation?

03:16.108 --> 03:18.154
You mean besides the publicity?

03:18.198 --> 03:20.461
Board of Rights says

03:20.504 --> 03:23.464
they uncovered new evidence
of conduct unbecoming.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.074
Some formal language about

03:25.117 --> 03:27.119
bringing disrepute
to the department.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.557
Guess I'm about
to be even less popular

03:29.600 --> 03:31.689
with a lot of cops now.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.778
You knew some of them would
never agree with your decision.

03:33.822 --> 03:36.041
Of course I did, Commander.

03:36.085 --> 03:38.696
But I got to ask...
if I got caught

03:38.740 --> 03:41.786
talking about Black power,
jamming up white citizens,

03:41.830 --> 03:43.701
do you think anybody
would be this angry

03:43.745 --> 03:45.050
to see me pay a price?

03:45.094 --> 03:47.488
I get your point,
but the reality is,

03:47.531 --> 03:49.490
now cops feel like they have
a target on their backs.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.883
Kevin Hilliard.

03:51.927 --> 03:55.539
Back in the day,
LAPD brought southern racists

03:55.583 --> 03:57.498
to our city
to patrol the streets,

03:57.541 --> 04:02.372
and Black and brown people been
suffering for it ever since.

04:02.416 --> 04:05.245
Well, these cops want to bash
our heads in the here and now?

04:05.288 --> 04:07.943
Then be on notice.
We'll defend ourselves,

04:07.986 --> 04:10.119
whatever we got to do.

04:10.162 --> 04:11.816
This thing could escalate fast.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.905
I also heard
from the chief.

04:13.949 --> 04:16.430
So there's some kind of
discipline coming your way soon

04:16.473 --> 04:18.040
for going outside
chain of command.

04:20.477 --> 04:21.913
Was it worth it?

04:24.699 --> 04:26.831
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.311
You do your final check-in
with the doctors?

04:28.355 --> 04:30.313
I'm getting admitted
to the hospital tomorrow.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.923
Transplant surgery's
the next day.

04:36.624 --> 04:39.279
Morning.

04:39.322 --> 04:41.324
Wow. Really?

04:41.368 --> 04:43.631
If that shoulder was any colder,
we'd all be freezing.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.110
Eh, just ignore it.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.590
People need some time
to let it all go.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.549
You taped Durham and his
pals because they deserve it.

04:48.592 --> 04:50.507
We don't need their racist
views patrolling the streets.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.204
And if Hondo going
to the press means bad cops

04:52.248 --> 04:54.032
get the boot, I'm good with it.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.339
But the attitude you and Hondo
are catching...

04:56.383 --> 04:57.906
it's not cool.

04:57.949 --> 04:59.516
You guys did the right
thing, Deac.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.126
Well, I appreciate that.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.085
Everyone's just wound up.

05:03.128 --> 05:05.130
I got a buddy at Hollywood
station, and he said that

05:05.174 --> 05:07.176
the threats made
by Black Justice Now

05:07.219 --> 05:10.179
has the officers over there
all on edge.

05:10.222 --> 05:12.573
Yeah, everyone's got
an opinion on this.

05:12.616 --> 05:14.966
-See you later.
-Bye.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.492
Oh, what's up with the suit?

05:18.535 --> 05:19.797
Ooh, you're busted.

05:19.841 --> 05:22.626
-Better tell 'em.
Hold on.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.193
Nice suit,
happy fiancÃ©e...

05:25.890 --> 05:27.414
You wouldn't by any chance
be about to elope now,

05:27.457 --> 05:28.458
would you, lover boy?

05:28.502 --> 05:29.677
That explains the last-minute,

05:29.720 --> 05:31.331
uh, vacation request.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.549
Okay, okay, enough with
the interrogation.

05:32.593 --> 05:33.681
I was gonna tell you guys.

05:33.724 --> 05:34.682
Tell us what? That you were

05:34.725 --> 05:35.683
gonna get married without us?

05:35.726 --> 05:37.206
It's just a civil ceremony

05:37.249 --> 05:38.381
down at the courthouse
after shift.

05:38.425 --> 05:39.817
You're all still
invited to the big bash

05:39.861 --> 05:41.558
when we can nail down a venue.

05:41.602 --> 05:43.386
Hey, we get it. You and
Bonnie have had to postpone

05:43.430 --> 05:44.822
your wedding how many times?

05:44.866 --> 05:46.781
You guys have waited long enough
for your big day.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.609
And we finally decided that
being married is more important

05:48.652 --> 05:50.132
than how we get married.

05:50.175 --> 05:52.177
And we wanted to fly off
to Bali tomorrow

05:52.221 --> 05:53.744
as an official couple.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.964
So it's not just a vacation
but a bona fide honeymoon.

05:56.007 --> 05:58.401
Well, that sounds
perfect, actually.

05:58.445 --> 06:01.056
It's about time we had some
good news around here.

06:07.802 --> 06:09.934
Is that what I think it is?

06:09.978 --> 06:11.893
Memorial plaque
for Erika.

06:11.936 --> 06:14.286
It's gonna be unveiled
at a ceremony next week.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.506
You and I will be in Germany
doing T.L.I. training.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.595
I tried to push our flight
to next week,

06:18.639 --> 06:20.641
but the schedule...

06:20.684 --> 06:23.121
It's all good.
I've already said my good-byes.

06:23.165 --> 06:25.385
It's nice no one's
forgotten her.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.473
Yeah, no one ever will.

06:40.051 --> 06:43.011
Hey, buddy, take that outside.

06:43.054 --> 06:45.317
Are you serious?

06:50.801 --> 06:52.890
-Is this yours?
-That ain't mine.

06:52.934 --> 06:53.978
Somebody else left it.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.244
Bomb!

06:59.288 --> 07:00.855
Get out, now!
Everyone out!

07:44.507 --> 07:45.769
If not for some
sharp eyes and quick thinking,

07:45.813 --> 07:47.641
this could've been
a whole lot worse.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.556
We're lucky nobody died.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.427
Sergeant Plumb's in
serious condition,

07:51.471 --> 07:53.385
but yeah, we caught
a break this time.

07:53.429 --> 07:54.604
You think there's
more to come?

07:54.648 --> 07:56.650
Chief's concerned it's
only the beginning.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.565
Patrol's being deployed
to set up a perimeter

07:58.608 --> 07:59.740
at every station.

07:59.783 --> 08:01.089
Bomb squad's in the process

08:01.132 --> 08:02.351
of clearing all LAPD buildings.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.919
The Mayor's speed dial finger's

08:04.962 --> 08:06.486
gonna need a splint after this.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.966
I'm not surprised.
LAPD's under attack.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.664
Whole world's watching
to see what we do.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.013
What we're gonna do is
find our bomber

08:12.056 --> 08:13.536
and anyone else responsible.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.538
I expedited the security
footage download from inside.

08:15.582 --> 08:16.713
We may have something.

08:16.757 --> 08:18.106
This is time-stamped

08:18.149 --> 08:21.283
shortly before the explosion.

08:21.326 --> 08:23.198
-Wait, I know that jacket.
-I bet you do.

08:23.241 --> 08:25.156
It's Kevin
Hilliard's trademark.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.115
Kevin's been all over the TV

08:27.158 --> 08:28.856
talking big about retaliation.

08:28.899 --> 08:30.945
I didn't think
he'd take the next step.

08:30.988 --> 08:33.817
Hondo, this isn't on you.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.602
I lit a fuse
by going to the press,

08:35.645 --> 08:38.343
and Kevin is the result.

08:38.387 --> 08:40.563
You can't control
people's worst impulses.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.522
Nobody could've predicted
Kevin and his group

08:42.565 --> 08:45.176
were gonna declare war
on the LAPD.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.091
Probably thought the bomb
would take out security cameras,

08:47.135 --> 08:48.919
help cover his tracks better.

08:48.963 --> 08:51.487
Tech pulled traffic cam
images of cars in the area

08:51.531 --> 08:52.749
right before and
after the bombing.

08:52.793 --> 08:55.230
There. Top right corner.
Late model Explorer.

08:55.273 --> 08:57.145
I drove past one
of Kevin's events

08:57.188 --> 08:58.625
a few days ago, and I saw him
hop in an Explorer

08:58.668 --> 08:59.626
that looked just like that.

08:59.669 --> 09:01.149
Well, sounds like
probable cause.

09:01.192 --> 09:02.716
Let's get a warrant
and bring him in.
No, hold up.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.631
We don't have a clear image
of Kevin on video.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.371
If we're gonna haul
him in, we got to be

09:06.415 --> 09:07.677
real smart
about how we do it.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.853
Well, I'm not sure we
have time for niceties.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.855
Commander, this city is
on a razor's edge.

09:11.899 --> 09:13.640
Kevin may be a radical
to the LAPD,

09:13.683 --> 09:15.729
but in his hood,
he is a leader.

09:15.772 --> 09:18.340
If we roll in showing force,
and we are not 100% sure,

09:18.383 --> 09:21.473
it could make things worse
for the community and for us.

09:21.517 --> 09:22.910
All right.
I'll trust your judgment,

09:22.953 --> 09:25.216
but one way or another,
we're bringing his ass in.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.523
According to social media,
Kevin's starting up a livestream

09:27.567 --> 09:29.743
near his block in about
-30 minutes.
All right, good.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.832
That gives us an opportunity
with him out in the open.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.703
I'll game-plan with the team
and get it done.

09:33.747 --> 09:37.272
I know. I'll keep you
posted on my end.

09:37.315 --> 09:38.795
I love you, too.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.625
So, how did Bonnie take it?

09:42.669 --> 09:44.975
She gets it.
With everything going on,

09:45.019 --> 09:47.543
courthouses canceled all
nonessential business.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.327
I'd say your wedding is
pretty essential to Bonnie.

09:49.371 --> 09:51.068
Yeah, well, the city
doesn't agree.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.635
I'm gonna buzz my mom
with the bad news,

09:52.679 --> 09:54.332
tell her the wedding's off.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.900
It sucks, for both of them.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.336
See? Relationships are
never easy,

09:58.380 --> 10:00.425
even when people are
perfect for each other.

10:00.469 --> 10:03.341
Is that you, admitting
we're perfect for each other?

10:03.385 --> 10:05.256
You mean except for the
whole "no fraternizing

10:05.300 --> 10:06.693
between team members" thing?

10:06.736 --> 10:09.870
Which is why we need...
to talk about us,

10:09.913 --> 10:11.567
preferably before you
get on a plane

10:11.611 --> 10:14.048
and fly away for the summer.

10:14.091 --> 10:16.398
You got to give it up.
Our situation's impossible.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.922
I'm not ready to concede
that point. Not yet.

10:18.966 --> 10:20.532
We have a bombing suspect
to catch.

10:20.576 --> 10:22.099
You're dodging the issue.

10:22.143 --> 10:25.668
Yes, I am. So move. Now.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.235
Okay.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.158
We're all in position, Hondo.

10:37.201 --> 10:38.638
All right.
Backup is around the block,

10:38.681 --> 10:41.031
ready to roll if needed.
Tell me what you see.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.380
We've got eyes on Kevin.

10:42.424 --> 10:43.730
He started his livestream.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.688
The LAPD has proven

10:45.732 --> 10:47.821
that they do not care
about the sanctity of our lives!

10:47.864 --> 10:49.823
Lots of strong words
about the police.

10:49.866 --> 10:52.173
He's got followers eating out
of the palm of his hand.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.741
Dude may have tried to murder
a station full of cops.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.612
Hate thinking his followers
might cheer that on, too.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.181
His sidekick has gang ink.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.793
20th Street Hammers.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.273
This isn't their spot.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.101
But if Kevin has them
for muscle,

11:07.144 --> 11:08.711
he must be prepping
for a bigger fight.

11:08.755 --> 11:09.886
Let's wait
'till he's on the move,

11:09.930 --> 11:11.018
make the approach before

11:11.061 --> 11:13.281
Kevin gets back to his block.

11:13.324 --> 11:16.676
When your immediate reaction
to racist cops is to transfer...

11:16.719 --> 11:18.199
You guys seeing this?

11:18.242 --> 11:19.591
Yeah. The vehicle matches

11:19.635 --> 11:20.592
the one seen
leaving the bombing.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.725
Clear. So here's ours.

11:22.769 --> 11:25.162
Black Justice Now.

11:25.206 --> 11:28.035
Black... Justice... Now!

11:30.733 --> 11:32.517
We're on.

11:49.447 --> 11:52.668
Kevin Hilliard,
step out of the vehicle! LAPD!

11:56.933 --> 11:58.500
Step out of the vehicle now!

11:58.543 --> 12:00.894
Hands above
your head!

12:02.547 --> 12:04.506
Walk backwards
towards me.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.683
Looky, looky here.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.642
Another day,
another bogus LAPD stop.

12:13.297 --> 12:14.734
Walk backwards towards me.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.694
Damn.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.435
Passenger, step out
of the vehicle,

12:20.478 --> 12:23.351
hands in the air
and walk backwards towards me.

12:24.874 --> 12:27.355
Y'all, we put this
on the Internet.

12:27.398 --> 12:30.662
Yeah, right. So these pigs just
pulled us over

12:30.706 --> 12:32.229
for leaving out of a park.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.796
So y'all help me
keep an eye on 'em.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.406
What you're gonna lie
and say I did this time?

12:35.450 --> 12:36.973
That's far enough.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.366
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

12:38.409 --> 12:39.628
Put your hands
behind your back.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.412
Yeah. I got it.

12:41.456 --> 12:44.285
Hey, everyone!
Look here!

12:45.547 --> 12:47.723
I am going peacefully
with these officers.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.421
No resistance. You see?

12:50.465 --> 12:52.859
If I end up with a bullet
in the back of my head,

12:52.902 --> 12:55.078
-you'll know why and who.
-Get in the car.

13:08.178 --> 13:09.571
Let's you and me talk straight.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.834
Sergeant Harrelson,

13:11.878 --> 13:14.445
the dude who dialed 911
on his own department.

13:14.489 --> 13:15.751
Props to you!

13:17.405 --> 13:18.754
So why you sweating me?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.756
We're fighting
the same damn fight.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.063
I do my thing
by trying to keep people safe,

13:23.106 --> 13:25.805
not by targeting innocents
and taking lives.

13:28.546 --> 13:31.158
A few bad cops doesn't give you
the green light

13:31.201 --> 13:32.942
to bomb a police station.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.683
Is that what
you got me in here for?

13:34.726 --> 13:36.554
I did not blow up
no police station.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.078
-Kevin,

13:38.121 --> 13:39.644
now is when you tell us

13:39.688 --> 13:41.646
if you and your group
are targeting more cops.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.518
Because if the next bomb
kills someone...

13:43.561 --> 13:46.651
I told you, I don't know
anything about no damn bomb.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.699
You want to rethink that answer?

13:52.570 --> 13:54.398
It's not me.

13:54.442 --> 13:57.184
I get why you think that's me,
but I'm not dumb enough

13:57.227 --> 13:59.751
to wear my regular jacket
and drive my own car

13:59.795 --> 14:01.188
to blow up a police station.

14:02.537 --> 14:05.148
Only bombs I use is truth bombs.

14:05.192 --> 14:08.543
Besides, you should
know where I was.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.153
Cops been following me
for weeks.

14:10.197 --> 14:12.286
What are you talking about?

14:12.329 --> 14:14.549
You weren't a person of
interest to us until today.

14:14.592 --> 14:17.682
You sure... brother?

14:17.726 --> 14:20.468
You just exposed a bad apple
in your own house.

14:21.773 --> 14:24.211
Cops love
to throw their weight around.

14:24.254 --> 14:27.910
Intimidation, frame-ups.

14:27.954 --> 14:30.652
Hell, y'all probably
framing me right now.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.915
No one's framing you here,
-Kevin.
-Well,

14:32.959 --> 14:35.004
the police are following me.

14:35.048 --> 14:38.921
Been tailing me for weeks
in a metallic blue sedan.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.315
You're wrong. It's not us.

14:41.358 --> 14:44.274
Then who the hell is it?

14:47.190 --> 14:49.018
You see this?

14:49.062 --> 14:51.412
The boys in blue just snatched
up our Black messiah.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.327
It's time they burn.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.764
So y'all show up
for war, you hear me?

14:55.807 --> 14:57.505
What the hell is that?

14:57.548 --> 15:00.116
It's a viral video.
Kevin's supporters are all over

15:00.160 --> 15:02.989
social media, calling for a mass
protest downtown later today.

15:03.032 --> 15:04.512
From the sound of it,
they're not showing up

15:04.555 --> 15:06.253
just to shout slogans.

15:06.296 --> 15:07.950
And now they're working with
the Hammers, there's a chance

15:07.994 --> 15:09.212
that armed gang members
will be mixed in

15:09.256 --> 15:11.084
with the regular
protesters.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.433
I'll alert the chief.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.000
Wait a second.

15:14.043 --> 15:16.567
That car-- metallic blue sedan.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.047
Kevin claims

15:18.091 --> 15:19.135
he's had a tail
lately, described

15:19.179 --> 15:20.920
exactly that.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.312
You think
he's telling the truth?

15:22.356 --> 15:23.966
I think there's more
going on here than we're seeing.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.489
Luca... I'll work the partial,

15:25.533 --> 15:27.056
see if I can narrow
down a list of owners.

15:32.627 --> 15:34.759
City feels heavy today.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.372
Lot of people looking
over their shoulders,

15:38.415 --> 15:40.896
not sure who to trust.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.898
Does that include you?

15:45.118 --> 15:48.338
This morning,
Chris told me that she...

15:48.382 --> 15:51.167
she doesn't think the system's
designed to get real justice.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.346
I always believed it was.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.696
And now, with everything,
it's just...

15:58.740 --> 16:00.089
it's got me thinking twice.

16:02.265 --> 16:05.007
We see something wrong,
we say something,

16:05.051 --> 16:07.705
that should be enough.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.664
Should get fixed.

16:09.707 --> 16:12.014
And then it doesn't.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.624
Deacon, you did
everything right.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.235
Durham got a slap
on the wrist.

16:15.278 --> 16:19.587
Until you went to the press,
and now we're both pariahs.

16:19.630 --> 16:24.113
Listen, man, I don't expect you
to agree with me going public,

16:24.157 --> 16:27.508
and I truly am sorry that
there's blowback on you now.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.466
I just felt like
I had no other choice.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.860
No, I know. I know.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.299
You know, according to Hicks,

16:36.343 --> 16:39.128
the chief has disciplinary
action coming my way.

16:39.172 --> 16:41.348
Are you worried?

16:41.391 --> 16:44.133
I'm on my own, man.

16:44.177 --> 16:47.658
The board's pissed at me;
the union, too, so...

16:47.702 --> 16:49.965
whatever happens,
I'll deal with it.

16:52.707 --> 16:55.275
You know that training thing
-that we talked about?
-Mm-hmm.

16:55.318 --> 16:57.886
Well, I want you to know
that I've signed up

16:57.929 --> 17:00.280
to mentor the new class
of LAPD recruits.

17:00.323 --> 17:03.109
Hopefully, get 'em on
the right track from day one.

17:03.152 --> 17:04.762
Well, they couldn't have
a better role model.

17:04.806 --> 17:07.026
Hey.

17:07.069 --> 17:10.203
I struck paydirt. DMV search
found 43 partial matches

17:10.246 --> 17:13.554
in L.A. County, but only one
was on a metallic blue sedan.

17:13.597 --> 17:15.512
Registered owner--
John Bridger.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.819
-Any connections to Kevin?
-Nothing directly.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.734
But he's racked up a few
assault charges, and get this.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.605
Disturbing the peace

17:21.649 --> 17:23.607
for counterprotesting
Black Justice Now events.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.348
-Counterprotesting?
-Yeah.

17:25.392 --> 17:26.654
So he's not Kevin's biggest fan.

17:26.697 --> 17:28.438
Maybe Bridger's stalking him.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.440
Everything we've looked at
so far has told a story

17:30.484 --> 17:32.355
of Kevin and his group
versus the LAPD.

17:32.399 --> 17:34.096
It just feels like
a piece is missing.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.098
Maybe Bridger is the key
to fill in the gaps.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.926
All right, texting you
his last known address.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.544
Gunfire.
Take cover.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.724
Street, Tan,

17:53.768 --> 17:55.335
take the three-side.

17:55.378 --> 17:56.814
Chris,
you're on the one-side with me.

18:11.438 --> 18:14.267
LAPD! Drop the weapon!

18:19.185 --> 18:20.969
Going hands on.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.107
30-David. Suspect down.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.586
He was headed
towards that garage.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.066
Let's clear it.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.423
This is a red Explorer.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.121
Check it out.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.732
Got a dead
Kevin Hilliard look-alike.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.037
Looks like fresh gunshot wounds.

18:46.081 --> 18:47.387
He's dressed
just like Kevin.

18:47.430 --> 18:50.433
This ride is
just like Kevin's.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.609
Bridger must have used him
as a double for the bombing,

18:52.653 --> 18:54.220
and then killed him.

18:54.263 --> 18:55.569
Hey, come see this.

18:57.962 --> 19:00.530
This stuff matches the materials
for the bomb at the 27th.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.315
Isn't that the park
where Kevin holds his events?

19:02.358 --> 19:05.013
He's got a list
of beat assignments.

19:05.056 --> 19:06.536
Bridger must have been tracking
patrol routes of the area.

19:06.580 --> 19:08.538
Photos of the Academy,
Snicks Diner.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.453
Every cop in town
eats there.

19:10.497 --> 19:12.934
That igloo--
I've seen that before.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.370
It was on the shooting gallery

19:14.414 --> 19:16.111
in the compound
where Erika was killed.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.721
It's one of the Imperial Dukes'
crazy symbols.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.114
If Bridger's
one of them...

19:19.158 --> 19:22.204
Surveillance on police,
the bomb,

19:22.248 --> 19:23.510
framing Kevin.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.469
This is all the Imperial Dukes.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.384
They're back.

19:34.956 --> 19:37.698
The chief's sending out word
that Kevin's no longer a suspect

19:37.741 --> 19:39.221
for the 27th
Division bombing.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.483
It might be too late, sir.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.224
That false flag
by the Imperial Dukes--

19:42.268 --> 19:43.486
it's already got people looking

19:43.530 --> 19:45.358
at Kevin and his group
as terrorists.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.490
At the same time, the Dukes have
put cops everywhere on edge,

19:47.534 --> 19:49.623
and we don't know how many more
attacks they have in the works.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.146
Chief ordered the Academy
to evacuate

19:51.190 --> 19:53.192
until Bomb Squad
finishes a sweep.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.368
And we're sending alerts
to every cop on patrol

19:55.411 --> 19:57.239
to be extra vigilant
with safety protocols.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.720
This group is methodical.

19:59.763 --> 20:03.158
By bombing the 27th, they...
they redirected patrol routes,

20:03.202 --> 20:04.725
the allocation of manpower.

20:04.768 --> 20:06.422
They could be targeting cops
anywhere in the city.

20:06.466 --> 20:07.728
The Imperial Dukes went
from attacks

20:07.771 --> 20:09.817
on individuals to crowds.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.123
After they killed Erika, we know
dead cops don't bother them.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.169
They're chaos agents trying
to tear down the system,

20:14.213 --> 20:16.127
starting with us, and
if they open racial wounds, too,

20:16.171 --> 20:18.173
all the better for them.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.393
Luca's dialed in with the feds
running everything on Bridger.

20:20.436 --> 20:21.742
Which means we may
finally be able

20:21.785 --> 20:23.961
to bring down the last
Imperial Dukes cell in L.A.

20:24.005 --> 20:26.268
That's not our only worry.
Deac and I were talking.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.966
We got to do something to lower
the temperature in this city.

20:29.010 --> 20:31.578
Commander,
tensions are so high,

20:31.621 --> 20:33.971
even the best cop might see a
peaceful protest as an attack,

20:34.015 --> 20:35.321
even if that's
not the intent.

20:35.364 --> 20:36.931
If there's something
we can do...

20:36.974 --> 20:38.759
I get it. Go.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.287
Don't need no damn
police protection.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.289
Kevin, I'm trying to make you
understand the stakes here.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.725
My whole life
is about stakes.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.510
You can't explain
anything to me.

20:50.553 --> 20:53.774
All right, then,
can I make an ask?

20:53.817 --> 20:55.732
And I know how
this is gonna sound.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.908
I need you to tell
your followers to stay home

20:57.952 --> 20:59.475
and not go to the protest.

20:59.519 --> 21:01.434
After they framed me?

21:01.477 --> 21:03.827
Those white power dudes
are trying to take us down,

21:03.871 --> 21:05.525
and you're telling us
to take our ball and stay home?

21:05.568 --> 21:07.266
We don't protest, they win.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.268
Neither one of us wants
a bunch of white nationalists

21:09.311 --> 21:11.705
to get a win today.

21:11.748 --> 21:14.577
Look, I know it's hard
for you to trust us.

21:14.621 --> 21:18.712
It wouldn't be if the LAPD were
occasionally on our side, man.

21:18.755 --> 21:22.324
Kevin, a lot of us are-are...
are working to make changes.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.979
And I know you're fighting
for what you think is right,

21:25.022 --> 21:27.111
but doing the right thing, that
can put a target on your back.

21:27.155 --> 21:29.331
Sergeant Harrelson
-still stood up.
-He did.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.812
He wasn't alone.

21:31.855 --> 21:34.771
But everything that we're doing
to make things better,

21:34.815 --> 21:37.644
that gets blown to hell
if this city goes up in flames.

21:41.517 --> 21:42.953
Nichelle.

21:42.997 --> 21:44.346
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.566
I need to talk with you
about something.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.524
-Sure. What's going on?
-That protest

21:48.568 --> 21:50.657
going on downtown, we got
to stop people from going.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.485
We've already put out
an alert, but...

21:52.528 --> 21:54.530
People won't listen
to the police.

21:54.574 --> 21:57.098
That's what the problem
is, ain't it? After all,

21:57.141 --> 22:00.101
it's the same LAPD
that jammed Kevin Hilliard up.

22:00.144 --> 22:01.885
Kevin got framed
because the Imperial Dukes

22:01.929 --> 22:04.018
want to blame a Black activist
for their crime.

22:04.061 --> 22:07.108
The Imperial Dukes were behind
-the bombing earlier today?
-Yeah.

22:07.151 --> 22:09.284
But even though
we can prove that,

22:09.328 --> 22:11.373
it won't take more than one
bad moment between a protester

22:11.417 --> 22:13.593
and a cop feeling targeted
for things to pop off.

22:13.636 --> 22:16.204
Now, we've asked Kevin to warn
folks away from the protest,

22:16.247 --> 22:17.423
help keep things
from getting out of hand,

22:17.466 --> 22:19.076
but we could still use
some more help.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.817
I'll make some calls.

22:25.648 --> 22:27.650
I see you looking at me.

22:27.694 --> 22:32.263
Leroy, Kevin hired the Hammers
for protection.

22:32.307 --> 22:33.613
Them being at that protest

22:33.656 --> 22:35.310
is gonna make it harder
to keep everyone safe.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.616
You mean them being there

22:36.659 --> 22:38.226
might piss off
trigger-happy cops?

22:39.880 --> 22:42.099
All you've ever done
is criticize my past.

22:42.143 --> 22:45.538
But now when it's convenient,
here you come.

22:45.581 --> 22:46.626
No one you or I

22:46.669 --> 22:48.497
care about
needs to get hurt, Leroy.

22:48.541 --> 22:50.064
I thought you was gonna fix
all these problems

22:50.107 --> 22:52.371
between Black and blue.
Remember that?

22:53.589 --> 22:54.895
Yeah, I guess not.

22:56.940 --> 22:59.378
Nah, you got to clean up
your own mess, bro.

23:09.475 --> 23:12.695
Look, I've heard everybody
crap on cops the past few days.

23:12.739 --> 23:14.741
And I'm not gonna lie.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.960
The reasons make sense.

23:17.004 --> 23:19.963
But a cop
also did help save my life.

23:20.007 --> 23:22.009
Hondo chose to help you, Darryl.

23:22.052 --> 23:24.359
-We don't owe him a damn thing.
-Okay,

23:24.403 --> 23:26.100
but it's not about that.

23:26.143 --> 23:28.972
Look, I get you guys are not
tight like brothers anymore,

23:29.016 --> 23:31.148
but he's out here
trying to help other people.

23:31.192 --> 23:32.976
Why can't we?

23:42.595 --> 23:45.162
New units are sweet.

23:45.206 --> 23:47.426
A lot less bulky.

23:48.992 --> 23:51.430
You know,
we don't have to just talk

23:51.473 --> 23:53.170
about new equipment.

23:54.868 --> 23:58.741
It's not breaking any rules
to talk about our situation.

23:58.785 --> 24:01.178
But we both agree
-the rules matter.
-Which is why

24:01.222 --> 24:03.224
I could transfer to another
department. We'd be golden.

24:03.267 --> 24:06.270
-I can't let you do that.
-For me, it's worth doing.

24:06.314 --> 24:08.142
Losing SWAT?

24:08.185 --> 24:09.709
This team?

24:10.971 --> 24:13.582
If it means
I get to be with you.

24:16.411 --> 24:18.761
We can't start a relationship
under that kind of pressure.

24:18.805 --> 24:20.937
That's crazy. We'd probably
break up in a month.

24:20.981 --> 24:22.417
Then where would you be?

24:22.461 --> 24:24.941
So you're open
to at least giving it a shot.

24:26.247 --> 24:28.641
I wish this was all as easy
as you want to make it.

24:28.684 --> 24:29.946
Look,

24:29.990 --> 24:32.514
we've tried
ignoring our feelings.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.211
We've tried moving on.

24:34.255 --> 24:35.952
This thing is real.

24:35.996 --> 24:38.346
Always has been.

24:38.389 --> 24:40.566
That's as simple as it gets.

24:42.306 --> 24:44.004
Except it isn't, because...

24:46.354 --> 24:47.529
...I have to think
about my career

24:47.573 --> 24:49.313
in a way that you don't.

24:49.357 --> 24:51.141
That's real, too.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.543
Luca, I got your text.
What do you got for me?

25:01.587 --> 25:03.589
Look, I looked at the stuff
from Bridger's garage.

25:03.632 --> 25:06.113
Guy was a fan
of headbanger music festivals.

25:06.156 --> 25:08.550
White nationalists
use them to recruit new talent.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.509
Bridger was sent a ticket

25:10.552 --> 25:12.249
off a group-sharing app
last month.

25:12.293 --> 25:14.121
Tickets are sent digitally
via cell numbers.

25:14.164 --> 25:15.601
Yeah, and I got three of 'em.

25:15.644 --> 25:17.646
Ran their numbers against
local ISP accounts

25:17.690 --> 25:19.648
and found their user profiles.

25:19.692 --> 25:21.998
These two are Don Fairburn
and Tripp Rathman,

25:22.042 --> 25:23.565
and, according
to the remote log-ins

25:23.609 --> 25:25.872
they used to communicate,
this is Marc Stargher.

25:25.915 --> 25:27.482
He spearheaded the meetups.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.832
Stargher was a VP
at a local think tank.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.225
Fired three years ago
after he stole

25:31.268 --> 25:33.444
and manipulated
company data on crime,

25:33.488 --> 25:35.098
lying that it
proved his theories

25:35.142 --> 25:38.058
on minority group behavior
and white supremacy.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.625
I think we finally found
our shot caller

25:39.668 --> 25:42.410
behind all the Imperial Dukes.
Nice work, Luca.

25:42.453 --> 25:45.500
Background in tech.
He could have easily facilitated

25:45.544 --> 25:47.633
the Imperial Dukes'
covert online activity.

25:47.676 --> 25:49.635
Yep. And his specialty at work?

25:49.678 --> 25:52.289
Public crisis response
and planning.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.857
So Stargher's familiar
with LAPD procedure.

25:54.901 --> 25:57.120
-He knows our moves.
Which means

25:57.164 --> 25:58.861
he knew after the
27th Division bombing

25:58.905 --> 26:00.297
we'd go on tactical alert,

26:00.341 --> 26:02.561
placing every available
cop on the street,

26:02.604 --> 26:05.346
making them all
potential targets.

26:05.389 --> 26:07.348
Bam. Got their
last known addresses.

26:07.391 --> 26:09.611
I'll update the chief.
Tell Hondo to tell the team

26:09.655 --> 26:12.222
to gear up.
I want 'em moving ASAP!

26:29.588 --> 26:31.633
Laser sentry disabled.

26:31.677 --> 26:32.808
Dropping in.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.291
Give me two.

26:41.469 --> 26:44.211
Whoa, whoa, hold up.
Another booby trap.

26:46.213 --> 26:48.258
Pretty sure
this is the power lead.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.395
Clear.

26:54.438 --> 26:55.701
-We good?
-Yeah.

26:57.703 --> 27:00.444
20-David to Command. Stargher's
place is clear. No sign of him.

27:00.488 --> 27:02.751
50- and 80-Squads hit the other
two last known addresses.

27:02.795 --> 27:04.492
No Imperial Dukes
were home.

27:04.535 --> 27:06.189
Which means they're probably
already on their way

27:06.233 --> 27:07.277
-to their next target.
Hey.

27:07.321 --> 27:09.279
-This is some sort of 3
-D map

27:09.323 --> 27:11.238
of 1st and Broadway.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.242
1st and Broadway's the site of
the Black Justice Now protest.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.117
Hey, I got receipts here
from Tanner Tactical.

27:21.161 --> 27:23.337
That's the uniform
wholesaler LAPD uses.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.555
If they're dressed as cops,

27:24.599 --> 27:25.687
they can walk
right up to their targets.

27:29.212 --> 27:30.997
They're not gonna attack cops.
They're gonna impersonate

27:31.040 --> 27:32.563
police officers
and attack the protesters.

27:32.607 --> 27:33.782
-What do we want?
Justice!

27:33.826 --> 27:34.783
When do we want it?

27:34.827 --> 27:35.784
Now!

27:35.828 --> 27:37.003
<i>If someone</i>

27:37.046 --> 27:38.613
in that crowd
fires back at police,

27:38.657 --> 27:41.311
the Imperial Dukes can
finally trigger their race war.

27:41.355 --> 27:43.139
Protest starts in 20 minutes.

27:48.014 --> 27:50.712
Protesters are already
showing up. Cops on the ground

27:50.756 --> 27:51.800
say hundreds more
are inbound.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.497
-What do you got?
-Okay, Chief's orders

27:53.541 --> 27:55.630
were to keep snipers away
from that intersection.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.066
We think Stargher
may have counted on that.

27:57.110 --> 27:58.677
I noticed there were
small, random hash marks

27:58.720 --> 28:00.591
on the butcher paper
of Stargher's map.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.942
Looks like they mapped out
shooting trajectories.

28:02.985 --> 28:05.074
The Dukes might have sniper
perches in these buildings.

28:05.118 --> 28:06.902
We've sent these images

28:06.946 --> 28:08.382
to all units in
the intersection.

28:08.425 --> 28:10.558
The protest starts
in ten minutes.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.865
If we use a stealth
approach, maybe 20-Squad

28:12.908 --> 28:14.388
can get to the Dukes before
they launch their plan.

28:14.431 --> 28:15.781
-Okay.
-Okay.

28:17.043 --> 28:18.087
-Justice!
When do we want it?

28:18.131 --> 28:19.436
Now!

28:19.480 --> 28:20.699
-What do we want?
Justice!

28:20.742 --> 28:22.875
-When do we want it?
Now!

28:22.918 --> 28:24.224
-What do we want?
Justice!

28:24.267 --> 28:25.268
20-David to
all D-Team,

28:25.312 --> 28:26.487
work your way up floor by floor.

28:26.530 --> 28:28.097
Clear the perches
overlooking the street.

28:28.141 --> 28:29.577
-When do we want it?
Now!

28:29.620 --> 28:31.100
-What do we want?
Justice!

28:31.144 --> 28:32.754
-When do we want it?
Now!

28:32.798 --> 28:34.625
30-David to Command,

28:34.669 --> 28:37.454
20-David and I are making entry
to the northwest building.

28:37.498 --> 28:39.892
71-David, we've made entry.

28:39.935 --> 28:41.241
Working our way
to the outer corner

28:41.284 --> 28:42.242
on the northeast building.

28:44.766 --> 28:48.291
Roger. 24-David's on the move
on the southeast.

29:00.869 --> 29:03.002
Psst.

29:05.918 --> 29:07.354
Justice!

29:07.397 --> 29:09.878
-That's right!
Now!

29:12.533 --> 29:14.883
-LAPD!
Don't move!

29:17.103 --> 29:18.931
Going hands on. On your stomach!

29:18.974 --> 29:22.021
Hands behind your back!
26-David,

29:22.064 --> 29:24.023
one Duke in custody
on the southwest corner.

29:24.066 --> 29:25.981
It's getting rowdy
in the street.

29:26.025 --> 29:27.504
We better get down there.

29:27.548 --> 29:28.810
Justice!

29:28.854 --> 29:30.333
-When do we want it?
Now!

29:30.377 --> 29:31.813
-What do we want?
Justice!

29:31.857 --> 29:33.684
-When do we want it?
Now!

29:33.728 --> 29:35.338
-What do we want?
Justice!

29:35.382 --> 29:36.905
-When do we want it?
Now!

29:36.949 --> 29:38.689
-What do we want?
Justice!

29:38.733 --> 29:40.430
-When do we want it?
Now!

29:40.474 --> 29:41.823
-What do we want?
Justice!

29:41.867 --> 29:43.564
-When do we want it?
Now!

29:43.607 --> 29:45.392
-What do we want?
Justice!

29:45.435 --> 29:47.002
-When do we want it?
Now!

29:47.046 --> 29:48.787
-What do we want?
Justice!

29:48.830 --> 29:50.440
When do we want it?

29:59.188 --> 30:00.624
Pig!

30:04.367 --> 30:05.978
-LAPD! On the ground!
Do it now!

30:07.588 --> 30:08.937
On your stomach.

30:08.981 --> 30:10.025
Hands behind your back.

30:10.069 --> 30:11.635
25-David,
another Duke in custody

30:11.679 --> 30:12.898
at the northeast.

30:12.941 --> 30:14.595
Flashbang hit the crowd.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.858
It's getting tense down there.
I see the Hammers moving in.

30:17.946 --> 30:19.818
Stop!

30:19.861 --> 30:22.168
Rocker's team cleared
the fourth building. It's empty.

30:22.211 --> 30:24.474
No sign of the last suspect,
Stargher, there.

30:24.518 --> 30:26.259
Then he's ours.

30:39.054 --> 30:40.795
Status?

30:58.639 --> 31:00.859
20-David to all units.
Be advised,

31:00.902 --> 31:03.687
our suspect is on the ground,
impersonating a police officer.

31:06.516 --> 31:08.475
No visual, Hondo.
Crowd's too big.

31:08.518 --> 31:11.652
Hammers. Young bloods.

31:11.695 --> 31:13.393
Leroy,
what you doing out here, man?

31:13.436 --> 31:16.526
Trying to save your asses.
You're being played.

31:16.570 --> 31:17.876
Only ones getting played
is these cops

31:17.919 --> 31:19.529
we about to bust up on.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.792
Those cops,
they may not be friends,

31:21.836 --> 31:24.056
but today,
they ain't your enemies.

31:24.099 --> 31:25.927
A bunch of racists framed Kevin

31:25.971 --> 31:28.147
to set this city on fire.
Set a trap

31:28.190 --> 31:29.365
for you to walk into.

31:29.409 --> 31:31.324
And you being out here,

31:31.367 --> 31:32.978
that's gonna give them

31:33.021 --> 31:34.980
war.

31:35.023 --> 31:36.851
Our people
-are getting attacked, man.
-Trust me,

31:36.895 --> 31:38.635
this ain't the place
for you to be today.

31:38.679 --> 31:39.810
Man, you tripping or what?

31:42.857 --> 31:44.337
CROWD

31:44.380 --> 31:45.991
Black Justice Now!

31:46.034 --> 31:48.080
You want to find out?

31:48.123 --> 31:51.953
Deac. Wait a minute.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.955
Black Justice Now!

31:59.134 --> 32:03.922
Black Justice Now! Black Justice
Now! Black Justice Now!

32:03.965 --> 32:07.403
Black Justice Now!

32:07.447 --> 32:10.319
-Hey, everyone,
I appreciate

32:10.363 --> 32:11.625
you coming out
to show your support.

32:11.668 --> 32:13.192
Kevin!

32:13.235 --> 32:14.845
Get down! You're-you're
too exposed up there.

32:14.889 --> 32:16.499
I got this. Go!

32:16.543 --> 32:18.197
Everyone, please
just listen to me.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.676
Please, just go home.
Just go home.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.678
Get out of here!
Go... home!

32:21.722 --> 32:25.160
Stargher hasn't gotten the
protesters to attack the cops.

32:25.204 --> 32:27.423
Which means his other option is
get the cops to attack them.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.208
Go home, everyone!

32:38.434 --> 32:40.436
Bomb detonation at
our location. Civilians down.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.830
One suspect still at large
in a police uniform.

32:50.185 --> 32:52.535
Wait a minute. Hold your fire!
Too many civilians!

32:52.579 --> 32:54.929
Suspect on a red Ducati
turning up Broadway!

32:54.973 --> 32:57.671
Hey! Sorry. I need
-to borrow your bike.
-Yo.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.673
Yo, you even know
how to ride one of these?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.851
26-David in pursuit.

33:03.894 --> 33:05.722
Copy. 26-David in pursuit.

33:05.766 --> 33:06.985
All available units respond.

33:09.204 --> 33:10.945
On Fifth heading towards Grand.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.207
Stay with him, Street.
We're rolling.

33:24.263 --> 33:26.047
He's headed into oncoming cars
on Fourth.

33:27.266 --> 33:29.181
20-Squad, call your locations.

33:29.224 --> 33:30.225
24-David coming up Second.

33:30.269 --> 33:31.226
25-David's on Fifth Street.

33:32.488 --> 33:33.576
30-David northbound on Olive.

33:38.277 --> 33:40.018
This guy's flying!
We got to get him off the road!

33:45.327 --> 33:47.721
We're headed onto the lower grid
on Fourth Street.

33:47.764 --> 33:49.549
We're almost there.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.480
Right on top of you, Street.
Trying to find my way down.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.966
Hondo, maybe we can corner him
in the tunnels.

34:16.010 --> 34:17.707
-Take him down safely.
All right, I'm on it.

34:17.751 --> 34:19.927
Chris, take the Second Street
tunnel. Tan, get Olive.

34:19.970 --> 34:21.320
Deacon, you're on Hill.
Box him in.

34:21.363 --> 34:22.756
-Got it.
-Copy that.

34:22.799 --> 34:24.888
I'm headed down.

34:24.932 --> 34:25.976
I'm almost with you, Street.

34:41.122 --> 34:43.124
Everyone, loop around the
park. Keep him off the freeways.

34:56.442 --> 34:59.314
Oh. Oh!

34:59.358 --> 35:00.402
Oh, my God!

35:18.072 --> 35:20.640
You're done.
All this is done.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.265
Go for it.

35:37.309 --> 35:39.485
You should have
the honor, Chris.

35:54.804 --> 35:56.545
Hey, Tan, there you are. You
got to hustle. Your ride's here.

35:56.589 --> 35:58.373
What ride?

35:58.417 --> 36:00.114
Look, I got a family friend
who's a judge.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.985
Gave him a buzz.
He can marry you and Bonnie

36:02.029 --> 36:04.162
if you make it to the
Pasadena courthouse by 6:00.

36:04.205 --> 36:05.337
Bonnie's already
on her way there.

36:05.380 --> 36:06.773
You guys, I'm not making it

36:06.816 --> 36:08.035
to Pasadena in 14 minutes.

36:08.078 --> 36:09.254
Yeah, we thought
about that, too.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.171
Are you kidding me?

36:15.260 --> 36:17.914
Guys... thank you.

36:20.656 --> 36:23.572
Seriously. Thank you.

36:23.616 --> 36:24.921
Come on. Time's
a-wasting. Let's go.

36:31.624 --> 36:34.061
-What are you doing?
-Hey, you're gonna
need a witness, right?

36:57.127 --> 36:59.434
Leroy, listen, man.

36:59.478 --> 37:02.611
Hey... Darryl was
worried about you, man.

37:02.655 --> 37:04.787
I can't have my son
worrying, right?

37:04.831 --> 37:07.921
Look, I know you guys
got this beef.

37:07.964 --> 37:09.314
I say something to one of you,

37:09.357 --> 37:11.185
and you think I'm siding
with the other,

37:11.229 --> 37:12.752
but I'm not.

37:12.795 --> 37:15.015
-I'm an adult now.
-You're my son.

37:15.058 --> 37:16.321
I'll always be your son.

37:16.364 --> 37:19.106
And, Hondo, you helped
save my life.

37:19.149 --> 37:20.150
Helped me turn
everything around.

37:21.848 --> 37:24.459
You both got me here,
but I can't live

37:24.503 --> 37:26.940
stuck in the middle of y'all.

37:26.983 --> 37:28.028
I gotta do me.

37:30.813 --> 37:32.424
Hmm.

37:32.467 --> 37:33.947
Wow.

37:33.990 --> 37:35.818
How about that?

37:35.862 --> 37:37.951
That's a grown-ass man
right there, if you ask me.

37:37.994 --> 37:38.995
Stubborn.

37:39.039 --> 37:40.127
Like his old man.

37:40.170 --> 37:42.085
Who you calling old?

37:47.830 --> 37:48.527
We did good.

37:48.570 --> 37:51.181
Yeah.

37:51.225 --> 37:54.446
I ain't too proud
to admit that...

37:54.489 --> 37:56.448
I'm damn thankful
for your help with him.

37:56.491 --> 37:58.319
I never wanted thanks, Leroy.

37:58.363 --> 37:59.581
Because you're stubborn.

37:59.625 --> 38:00.930
Like me.

38:03.237 --> 38:05.108
So...

38:07.197 --> 38:08.286
...we good?

38:11.854 --> 38:13.291
We're good.

38:23.344 --> 38:25.825
I'm going to postpone
leaving for T.L.I.

38:25.868 --> 38:27.653
I don't think I can go
to Germany

38:27.696 --> 38:29.350
until you're out of surgery
and I know you're okay.

38:29.394 --> 38:32.135
Chris, the T.L.I. dates
are firm.

38:32.179 --> 38:33.267
If they're mad
I have to come late,

38:33.311 --> 38:35.225
then I don't need to go.

38:35.269 --> 38:36.488
Didn't you just tell me earlier

38:36.531 --> 38:38.316
you have to be careful
with your career?

38:38.359 --> 38:40.187
Do you want me to care
what happens to you or not?

38:40.230 --> 38:43.495
I... I'm gonna be fine, okay?

38:43.538 --> 38:46.759
The doctor promises full
recovery, almost definitely.

38:48.674 --> 38:50.893
And you worked for months
to earn that ticket to Germany.

38:50.937 --> 38:53.418
You cannot blow that off now.

38:53.461 --> 38:54.854
Even for something
as great as me.

38:58.553 --> 39:02.252
We still don't have a solution
to our problem.

39:02.296 --> 39:04.472
So we'll just keep talking.

39:04.516 --> 39:07.214
We're two highly skilled
police officers

39:07.257 --> 39:09.303
with extensive training
in negotiations.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.217
We'll figure it out.

39:14.395 --> 39:17.093
Okay.

39:40.856 --> 39:42.597
Call me after the surgery.

39:42.641 --> 39:44.643
The second I wake up.

39:59.179 --> 40:03.444
I spent my whole life feeling
threatened by those uniforms.

40:03.488 --> 40:08.101
But today,
I saw something different.

40:08.144 --> 40:11.844
It doesn't fix the past...

40:11.887 --> 40:15.064
but maybe...
maybe it's a place to start.

40:18.503 --> 40:21.419
I met with the chief.

40:24.378 --> 40:26.380
When do I go before the board?

40:26.424 --> 40:27.860
Well, they don't want to
give you the satisfaction,

40:27.903 --> 40:29.862
or the platform.

40:29.905 --> 40:33.822
LAPD feels like you pushed
them into a corner, so...

40:33.866 --> 40:35.433
they want to return the favor.

40:40.176 --> 40:42.265
You're being demoted
from 20-Squad leader.

40:48.184 --> 40:49.925
They want to force me to quit

40:49.969 --> 40:51.971
so they can keep
their hands clean.

40:56.541 --> 40:59.718
Wow.

40:59.761 --> 41:03.156
I ain't gonna lie, I did not
see that one coming.

41:03.199 --> 41:04.853
Yeah.

41:06.289 --> 41:08.248
But I probably should have.

41:09.728 --> 41:12.382
The department made me
20-Squad leader

41:12.426 --> 41:15.037
so they could save face.

41:15.081 --> 41:17.475
I'm gonna lose it now
for the same reason.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.132
Yeah.

41:23.176 --> 41:26.135
Look, um,...

41:26.179 --> 41:29.443
Luca, Chris and Tan are all
heading out of the country,

41:29.487 --> 41:31.053
and Street's on medical leave,

41:31.097 --> 41:33.186
and Deacon wants to spend
more time with his cadets,

41:33.229 --> 41:36.015
so if you want to
take some time to decide

41:36.058 --> 41:37.103
what you want to do...

41:38.887 --> 41:41.977
...just know two things.

41:42.021 --> 41:45.764
One, I'm on your side.

41:45.807 --> 41:51.160
And two, you helped
save this city.

41:51.204 --> 41:54.294
Remember that
when you choose.
