WEBVTT

00:00.249 --> 00:02.919
Have you ever
identified with a character

00:02.920 --> 00:05.070
and when... let's say
they were killed

00:05.071 --> 00:06.423
you're, like, "aw."

00:06.424 --> 00:07.908
Um...

00:07.909 --> 00:09.244
In a movie I have had,
tears, like, uh...

00:09.245 --> 00:10.302
- Yeah?
<i>- E.T.</i>

00:10.303 --> 00:11.803
- No, not <i>E.T.</i> 
<i>- E.T.</i>

00:11.804 --> 00:13.316
- You cried at <i>E.T.?</i>
- Yeah, I did.

00:13.317 --> 00:14.765
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:17.122 --> 00:18.957
What point... at what point
did you cry in <i>E.T.?</i>

00:18.958 --> 00:20.292
- When he died.
- When he died?

00:20.293 --> 00:21.627
Yeah.

00:21.628 --> 00:22.962
You didn't think
he was really dead, did you?

00:22.963 --> 00:24.364
I mean we're the same age...
You didn't think

00:24.365 --> 00:26.443
- he was coming back to life?
- We were 11.

00:26.444 --> 00:28.654
Mike, you were born
the same year I was born, right?

00:28.655 --> 00:30.774
- '67, right.
- Okay, hold on.

00:30.775 --> 00:32.281
'Cause I don't think
we were 11.

00:34.181 --> 00:35.982
- It came out in '82.
- We were not 11.

00:35.983 --> 00:38.580
It came out in 1982.
So you were 15.

00:39.721 --> 00:41.155
14.

00:41.156 --> 00:44.293
He'll never
phone home again!

00:44.294 --> 00:46.838
Don't you people understand?

00:46.839 --> 00:49.257
Are you not seeing
what I'm seeing?

01:04.185 --> 01:06.820
- Help!
- Help!

01:09.057 --> 01:11.446
Zap!

01:33.785 --> 01:35.137
Hello and welcome
to another episode

01:35.138 --> 01:37.055
of <i>comic book men,</i>
the only show

01:37.056 --> 01:39.791
with less testosterone
than <i>sex and the city.</i>

01:39.792 --> 01:40.892
I'm Kevin Smith.

01:40.893 --> 01:42.811
- Walt Flanagan.
- Bryan Johnson.

01:42.812 --> 01:46.098
- Ming chen.
- And Michael Zapcic.

01:46.099 --> 01:48.316
If you could pick any
comic book character out there,

01:48.317 --> 01:49.526
who would you
have a drink with?

01:49.527 --> 01:50.944
One night only.

01:50.945 --> 01:52.271
You, Kevin, and...

01:52.272 --> 01:53.697
The invisible woman.

01:53.698 --> 01:56.141
Sue Richards, 'cause then
you would see it going into her.

01:56.142 --> 01:57.868
And it might help you
control your own drinking.

01:57.869 --> 01:59.378
'Cause you're, like,
"that's what it looks like?"

01:59.379 --> 02:01.872
And you could watch it slowly
deteriorate her from inside.

02:01.873 --> 02:03.515
What about you?

02:03.516 --> 02:05.792
Betty from <i>Archie.</i>
Is she considered a superhero?

02:06.253 --> 02:08.086
- Mm-hm.
- I think she's underage though.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.295
- Seriously.
- I know.

02:10.625 --> 02:12.026
That's why I'm asking.

02:12.027 --> 02:13.361
- Mike?
- Tony stark.

02:13.362 --> 02:15.330
Oh, man, you'd drink
with Tony stark.

02:15.331 --> 02:17.304
He might be trying
to 12-step you the whole time.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.669
Oh, the one hero that
has a problem with alcohol

02:19.670 --> 02:20.974
and you're, like,
"I wanna go with him."

02:20.975 --> 02:22.439
It's almost
as if somebody's just, like,

02:22.440 --> 02:24.375
"hey, man, you could
bring one guest

02:24.376 --> 02:26.480
to the kryptonite ball."

02:29.108 --> 02:31.359
- Damn right.
- And you're, like, "superman?"

02:37.624 --> 02:39.534
- Excuse me.
- Yes, hi.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.194
Hi, um, I have
a bunch of comic books

02:41.195 --> 02:42.328
I would like to sell.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.789
Okay, what kind
of comics are they?

02:43.790 --> 02:46.708
Superhero, monsters
<i>Batman, spider-man.</i>

02:47.034 --> 02:48.335
Do you have them
with you?

02:48.336 --> 02:49.544
Uh, they're in the car.

02:49.545 --> 02:50.962
I need somebody
to help me with the box.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.631
- Is the box heavy?
- Yeah.

02:52.632 --> 02:54.475
Okay... ming!

02:54.476 --> 02:56.244
- Just one box?
- One box.

02:56.245 --> 02:58.847
It's heavy.

02:58.848 --> 03:00.515
Thank you.

03:00.516 --> 03:02.351
I see you breaking
a sweat there, huh?

03:02.352 --> 03:03.853
Can you get
the door for me, please?

03:04.433 --> 03:05.888
- Sure.
- Thank you.

03:05.889 --> 03:07.857
A lot of books here, Mike.

03:07.858 --> 03:08.939
Back this way.

03:09.493 --> 03:12.228
Hey, you like
looking at some comics?

03:12.229 --> 03:13.902
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

03:13.903 --> 03:15.153
- Name's Walt.
- Hi Walt, I'm Mary Anne.

03:15.154 --> 03:16.700
Okay, what
do we got here?

03:16.701 --> 03:17.834
Got a bunch of comics.

03:17.835 --> 03:19.536
I came all the way
from staten island.

03:19.537 --> 03:21.738
- I lugged this.
- Are these yours?

03:21.739 --> 03:22.911
Yeah, my husband found them.

03:22.912 --> 03:24.788
He works with sanitation,
and he found them.

03:24.789 --> 03:26.581
He found them
at the dump?

03:26.582 --> 03:27.743
Uh, on the curb.

03:27.744 --> 03:29.745
And by "dump"
I mean staten island.

03:29.746 --> 03:31.714
Ha ha ha. You're funny.

03:31.715 --> 03:34.381
Who is he? He's funny.

03:34.382 --> 03:37.425
Sometimes it's not easy
trying to seal a deal

03:37.426 --> 03:41.221
when Bryan's sitting there
and disparaging where she lives.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.889
Did she seem
noticeably, like, "hm."

03:42.890 --> 03:44.127
- Oh, yeah.
- She was annoyed.

03:44.128 --> 03:45.395
- Really.
- Hey, but it's understandable.

03:45.396 --> 03:47.564
She comes in, she thinks
she's gonna be conducting business.

03:47.565 --> 03:49.032
She doesn't assume for a second

03:49.033 --> 03:50.689
some guy's just gonna start
insulting where she lives.

03:50.690 --> 03:51.857
"So, where are you from?

03:51.858 --> 03:53.937
Oh, that's garbage pit."

03:53.938 --> 03:55.694
Is that what
all these seagulls are about

03:55.695 --> 03:56.906
swarming around you?

03:56.907 --> 03:58.641
There goes
our staten island business.

03:58.642 --> 04:01.144
There's some nice comics
right off the bat.

04:01.145 --> 04:04.647
Ooh, <i>Nick fury</i> of <i>S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>
Number 1. Really nice.

04:09.832 --> 04:11.121
<i>Iron man.</i>

04:11.122 --> 04:14.129
Wow, an <i>invincible
iron man</i> number 1.

04:14.130 --> 04:15.291
If it was
in nice shape,

04:15.292 --> 04:16.923
you'd have quite
a find right here.

04:21.677 --> 04:24.097
Oh, <i>justice league</i>
number 6.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.266
I just wish
it was in better condition.

04:33.376 --> 04:35.650
Ming, anything that's recent,
don't even put on the table.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.319
- Right into the garbage.
- Garbage? Hey!

04:37.320 --> 04:38.695
We're not gonna really
have an interest

04:38.696 --> 04:39.988
in the newer stuff.

04:39.989 --> 04:41.351
These?

04:41.352 --> 04:43.886
Yeah, in the comic world,
a ten-year-old comic

04:43.887 --> 04:47.203
is like a comic
that came out yesterday.

04:47.204 --> 04:49.205
I just wanna
get rid of them.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.624
I'm really not
a comic book person.

04:50.625 --> 04:53.628
No insult, I can see you guys
are really, uh...

04:53.629 --> 04:55.997
- Into your comics.
- No insult whatsoever.

04:55.998 --> 04:58.381
Not everybody can be into
something as cool as comics.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.968
Give me 1,000 and you can
have the whole tupperware.

05:00.969 --> 05:03.138
And I'll even throw
my box in for free.

05:03.139 --> 05:04.220
Whoa!

05:08.726 --> 05:10.412
You wanna be able
to help every customer

05:10.413 --> 05:12.615
and be, like, "here's
some money for your fine gifts."

05:12.616 --> 05:14.651
- But you can't.
- They think it's worth 1,000.

05:14.652 --> 05:16.219
- They want 1,000 for it.
- Right.

05:16.220 --> 05:17.317
They just
don't seem to understand

05:17.318 --> 05:18.693
it doesn't
work that way.

05:18.694 --> 05:21.655
Like, "I opened up a guide
and it said $1,000."

05:21.656 --> 05:23.531
So shouldn't I get
$1,000?"

05:23.532 --> 05:25.700
I priced them,
I did the comic book guide.

05:25.701 --> 05:27.160
I mean, that one book...

05:27.161 --> 05:28.732
The one that has
<i>the fantastic four...</i>

05:28.733 --> 05:31.915
That one, it said
it was, like, $740.

05:31.916 --> 05:34.405
Right, but someone
has written in grease marker,

05:34.406 --> 05:35.572
"10â¢."

05:35.573 --> 05:37.128
- Correct.
- And the number 6 on there,

05:37.129 --> 05:38.609
it's not in mint condition.

05:38.610 --> 05:40.110
Okay.

05:40.111 --> 05:41.841
While there are
some good books...

05:41.842 --> 05:42.884
Yeah.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.415
There's also
a couple stinkers.

05:44.416 --> 05:46.346
I can't do 1,000.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.806
It's gonna be
a little lower.

05:47.807 --> 05:50.622
Um, it'll probably be
less than 1,000 that I'll get,

05:50.623 --> 05:52.310
so...

05:52.825 --> 05:55.355
I could take just
these off your hands today.

05:55.729 --> 05:57.857
I could give you 250.

05:58.365 --> 06:00.299
- $250?
- Yes.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.634
Then you might as well
just take them,

06:01.635 --> 06:02.902
put them right back in.

06:02.903 --> 06:05.904
And Ming'll put them
right back in my car.

06:09.209 --> 06:10.912
- I'll carry them back.
- All right.

06:10.913 --> 06:13.812
- Thank you.
- What a brief negotiation.

06:15.481 --> 06:18.003
- I mean, really, clearly one...
- It's a tough economy.

06:18.004 --> 06:19.082
- You know how it is.
- You know what?

06:19.083 --> 06:20.451
They can go right back
in my attic.

06:20.452 --> 06:21.619
But you just said you
don't wanna carry them around.

06:21.620 --> 06:23.120
See, that... you're
in a negotiation.

06:23.121 --> 06:24.521
You know what?

06:24.522 --> 06:26.390
You gotta tell him, like,
"250? What are you crazy?"

06:26.391 --> 06:27.892
- Give me 800.
- He said he's gonna offer.

06:27.893 --> 06:29.126
There's no negotiations.

06:29.127 --> 06:30.098
I never said
there's no negotiations.

06:30.099 --> 06:31.766
- Oh, okay.
- But...

06:31.767 --> 06:34.998
Okay, 999.

06:34.999 --> 06:35.854
350.

06:36.168 --> 06:38.636
- No?
- No.

06:38.637 --> 06:40.872
- 900.
- Not a chance.

06:40.873 --> 06:41.973
- Not a chance.
- Not a chance.

06:41.974 --> 06:43.408
- 350's not a...
- Big gap there.

06:43.409 --> 06:45.143
Well, that's...
You know what?

06:45.144 --> 06:46.990
- Very big gap, um...
- How about 700?

06:46.991 --> 06:49.580
And you could have them.

06:49.581 --> 06:51.682
How about...
375.

06:51.683 --> 06:53.384
Listen, 700.

06:53.385 --> 06:55.986
I came down from 1,000
to 700.

06:55.987 --> 06:57.250
You're stuck at 300.

06:57.688 --> 06:59.856
You know, unfortunately
that is probably the best

06:59.857 --> 07:01.057
I'm gonna be able
to do today.

07:01.058 --> 07:02.125
- Okay.
- All right?

07:02.126 --> 07:05.028
What about
a commission-type deal?

07:05.029 --> 07:06.530
Where you take the comics,
you sell them

07:06.531 --> 07:08.732
and take a commission
off each one?

07:08.733 --> 07:11.431
- We have done that in the past.
- What's the commission?

07:11.432 --> 07:12.603
We've sold collections
for people,

07:12.604 --> 07:14.939
we take 20%
off the sale.

07:14.940 --> 07:16.374
So you get 80%
of the sale.

07:16.375 --> 07:19.644
Out of your hair, we're
doing a lot of work for you.

07:19.645 --> 07:21.446
Well, you don't understand
the attachment she has

07:21.447 --> 07:23.414
to something found
in the garbage.

07:23.415 --> 07:24.449
- I understand.
- From staten island.

07:24.450 --> 07:25.904
15 years ago.

07:25.905 --> 07:27.864
Why don't we leave them here
in new Jersey?

07:27.865 --> 07:29.054
Yeah?
You wanna do that?

07:29.055 --> 07:30.322
- Yeah, I'll do it.
- All right.

07:30.323 --> 07:32.452
- A marriage.
- A marriage.

07:32.453 --> 07:34.954
- Mazel tov.
- I'm not happy.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.915
Take it out to the front.
Thank you.

07:36.916 --> 07:38.625
- All right.
- Thank you very much.

07:38.626 --> 07:39.963
And we'll
get on this immediately.

07:39.964 --> 07:41.164
Okay, thank you.

07:41.165 --> 07:43.004
This is where I sit
dispensing my wisdom.

07:43.005 --> 07:45.302
I'm like Solomon over here.

07:45.303 --> 07:47.926
Dividing  right and left.

07:47.927 --> 07:49.474
It's times like that
I wonder, like, you know,

07:49.475 --> 07:50.762
maybe we should...

07:51.343 --> 07:53.765
Keep me on your team?

07:56.516 --> 07:59.986
I've been dying to ask,
how did the commercial go?

07:59.987 --> 08:02.816
The commercial was my
brainchild, I'll have to admit.

08:02.817 --> 08:04.943
I rallied these guys and I was
like, "we gotta do this."

08:04.944 --> 08:07.193
This is something you've
been talking about forever.

08:07.194 --> 08:08.261
Walt's forever been, like,

08:08.262 --> 08:09.739
"we should put
a commercial on TV."

08:09.740 --> 08:11.658
And I was, like,
"I don't know, man."

08:18.580 --> 08:20.141
All right, guys,
I need ideas.

08:20.142 --> 08:21.251
So hit me with some ideas.

08:21.252 --> 08:23.253
What's something
that we can utilize

08:23.254 --> 08:25.046
to really, just, like,

08:25.047 --> 08:27.281
we punch them in the face,
and we're out.

08:27.282 --> 08:28.449
And then they
come to see us,

08:28.450 --> 08:29.968
"why did I just
get punched in the face?"

08:29.969 --> 08:33.053
What's hot right now?
What are the kids into?

08:38.017 --> 08:39.226
Toys?
Kids like toys.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.270
Okay, well,
we'll shoot our toy section.

08:41.272 --> 08:44.798
That's a good idea.
What else?

08:44.799 --> 08:46.900
I know what's hot right now.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.635
Isn't, like,
gay kissing hot right now?

08:48.636 --> 08:49.988
Like, <i>glee</i> and everything?

08:49.989 --> 08:51.605
How about... would
you guys be into that maybe

08:51.606 --> 08:52.673
for, like, real quick?

08:52.674 --> 08:54.274
Just doing a quick smooch
on camera?

08:54.275 --> 08:55.827
- Me and Mike?
- Yeah.

08:55.828 --> 08:57.144
- Come on, guys.
- No.

08:57.145 --> 08:58.788
Absolutely not.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.047
- That's where I draw the line.
- That's...

09:00.048 --> 09:01.315
All right,
we don't have a lot

09:01.316 --> 09:02.583
of resources for this,

09:02.584 --> 09:03.835
but I think that's where
we embrace it then.

09:03.836 --> 09:06.671
Like, tongue-in-cheek,
over-the-top,

09:06.672 --> 09:09.174
bad, bad, bad commercial.

09:09.175 --> 09:11.692
So the idea is to, like,
go out there with something

09:11.693 --> 09:13.727
that people would stop...
Not, like, you know

09:13.728 --> 09:15.463
it's intentionally bad
but you want it to come across

09:15.464 --> 09:16.664
like you were serious
and earnest.

09:16.665 --> 09:18.057
Yeah, exactly.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.001
But it's so stunningly
unprofessional.

09:21.002 --> 09:23.537
Yeah, stupid
and just, like, wooden

09:23.538 --> 09:26.733
and I said
I got my guys, they're wooden.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.401
- Yeah.
- They can do it.

09:28.402 --> 09:31.312
- You know, shot on cheesy video.
- Right.

09:31.313 --> 09:33.114
Bad graphics popping up.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.784
I mean,
it truly is a spectacle.

09:35.785 --> 09:36.885
Right.

09:36.886 --> 09:38.219
And anybody
who's watching TV...

09:38.220 --> 09:39.721
- How'd this get on?
- Exactly.

09:39.722 --> 09:40.922
That's what we're looking for.

09:40.923 --> 09:42.224
What the hell is this?

09:42.225 --> 09:44.059
- Who's gonna direct this?
- Uh, what about Bryan?

09:44.060 --> 09:45.668
Bryan directed <i>vulgar,</i> right?

09:45.669 --> 09:47.086
He did.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.798
So you don't reach out

09:48.799 --> 09:51.591
to the obvious
directorial talent

09:51.592 --> 09:53.134
to headline the commercial?

09:53.135 --> 09:54.937
I thought he did.

09:56.206 --> 09:57.573
If you wanna stop someone
dead in their tracks

09:57.574 --> 09:58.908
from getting up,
going to the bathroom

09:58.909 --> 10:01.601
or changing the channel,
turn to the director of <i>vulgar.</i>

10:02.078 --> 10:04.180
It is an awesome
exploitation movie,

10:04.181 --> 10:06.147
one that inspired me eventually
to make <i>red state.</i>

10:06.148 --> 10:08.251
So it stands to reason
that they would turn to you

10:08.252 --> 10:11.821
to direct the disturbing,
almost David Lynchian commercial

10:11.822 --> 10:13.154
for the secret stash.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.989
Okay, boys,
I've locked the front door.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.125
It's just us.

10:16.126 --> 10:17.700
I think we're in
for a long night,

10:17.701 --> 10:21.463
'cause we're not leaving here
till we come up with 30 seconds

10:21.464 --> 10:25.041
of complete dog feces.

10:34.510 --> 10:37.053
Who's ready to make
a little local history?

10:37.054 --> 10:38.513
Holy crap.

10:38.514 --> 10:42.284
I got the call from Walt.

10:42.285 --> 10:45.387
I'm ready to bust out
my directing chair.

10:45.388 --> 10:46.479
Dust it off.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.439
Start earning this store
some business.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.060
See, I knew the days and weeks
and months of hanging out here

10:51.061 --> 10:52.986
would eventually pay off.

10:52.987 --> 10:55.832
What was your contribution
to this as director?

10:56.363 --> 10:58.783
They had an unformed
ball of Clay, right?

10:58.784 --> 11:00.535
Yeah, it was
in the larval stage if you will.

11:00.536 --> 11:02.412
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, a pupae.

11:03.974 --> 11:05.374
You were the guy,
you were the arbiter

11:05.375 --> 11:07.417
of what the spot
would be, man.

11:07.418 --> 11:08.544
And he knew
who to come to.

11:08.545 --> 11:10.246
He's, like,
"I need crap."

11:11.839 --> 11:13.283
"Who can
bring it to me?"

11:13.284 --> 11:15.051
All right, let's get
lined up for the first shot.

11:15.052 --> 11:18.254
- Let's do it.
- Front of store.

11:18.255 --> 11:21.347
- Boom, right here.
- All right.

11:34.207 --> 11:35.841
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

11:35.842 --> 11:38.577
All right.

11:38.578 --> 11:40.713
- Holy.
- Who's holding up the cue card?

11:41.116 --> 11:45.705
- Cue cards ready?
- Cue cards ready.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.124
This is the first line
in what's gonna be

11:48.125 --> 11:51.002
the greatest commercial
ever filmed.

11:51.325 --> 11:52.420
This is a big moment.

11:52.421 --> 11:55.028
The stash's first commercial.

11:55.029 --> 11:56.462
- You ready?
- Ready.

11:56.463 --> 11:58.092
Whew!

11:58.093 --> 11:59.969
And...

11:59.970 --> 12:01.471
Action!

12:01.472 --> 12:03.202
You want comics?

12:03.203 --> 12:05.725
We got that!

12:05.726 --> 12:08.006
- Cut.
- Do it again?

12:08.007 --> 12:10.188
We better do it again,
it wasn't recording.

12:10.189 --> 12:13.477
Ooh.

12:13.478 --> 12:15.193
- Got some <i>fireside</i> books.
- Whoa.

12:15.581 --> 12:17.648
This could be the very first
trade paperback

12:17.649 --> 12:20.031
in the history
of comic books.

12:20.032 --> 12:22.653
I know there's some stuff
in here that's pretty old.

12:22.654 --> 12:23.720
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

12:23.721 --> 12:25.620
That is actually awesome.

12:25.621 --> 12:27.291
It's gotta be
in the top 25 most valuable

12:27.292 --> 12:29.260
comics in the world.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.883
You saw <i>Ghostbusters</i>
in the theaters, right?

12:38.884 --> 12:40.968
People will go nuts
when you say stuff like this,

12:40.969 --> 12:42.643
but I never really
had any particular affinity

12:42.644 --> 12:44.097
for <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

12:44.098 --> 12:45.306
Get out!

12:45.307 --> 12:46.682
The friendship's
been a nice ride, but...

12:50.152 --> 12:51.352
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

12:51.353 --> 12:52.420
What's goin' on?
How's it going?

12:52.421 --> 12:53.654
- Good.
- You need any help?

12:53.655 --> 12:55.858
Yes, well, I'd like
to help you guys out

12:55.859 --> 12:59.293
- and, uh, unload some books, perhaps.
- Okay, got some stuff to sell?

12:59.294 --> 13:00.595
- Yeah.
- Wow.

13:00.596 --> 13:03.064
- Got some <i>fireside</i> books.
- Whoa, wow.

13:03.065 --> 13:04.899
Um, some marvel and DC.

13:04.900 --> 13:07.801
This very well could be
the very first trade paperback

13:07.802 --> 13:09.372
in the history
of comic books.

13:16.210 --> 13:18.811
The <i>fireside</i> books
really are kind of the first

13:18.812 --> 13:21.843
graphic novels
or, you know, collections

13:21.844 --> 13:23.215
of storylines
that are made up

13:23.216 --> 13:26.051
of 10, 12 different
separate issues of a comic book,

13:26.052 --> 13:28.808
all collected under one cover
they called a "trade paperback."

13:28.809 --> 13:30.990
First time that
kind of legitimized comics

13:30.991 --> 13:32.192
and put them
in book stores.

13:32.193 --> 13:33.360
Yes.

13:33.361 --> 13:34.895
Right on the shelves
with, like, Shakespeare.

13:34.896 --> 13:37.859
- Yes, and <i>the joy of sex.</i>
- Exactly.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.235
The only two books
we can ever name

13:39.236 --> 13:40.736
off the top
of our heads.

13:42.137 --> 13:43.698
- I had this as a kid.
- Me too, yeah.

13:43.699 --> 13:46.340
This is how I discovered...
Was able to read

13:46.341 --> 13:47.908
the first appearances
of the characters.

13:47.909 --> 13:49.120
- Oh, yeah.
- Where'd you get them from?

13:49.121 --> 13:50.997
Well, these
are actually my dad's.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.379
He was getting rid
of some stuff

13:52.873 --> 13:55.048
when he was retiring,
and I got his secret stash

13:55.049 --> 13:56.252
treasure box.

13:56.253 --> 13:57.685
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't say "secret stash."

13:57.686 --> 13:59.505
- You owe us $4.
- Yeah.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.550
They're not
in that great of shape.

14:02.551 --> 14:05.303
I mean, the back covers
have a lot of wear on the back.

14:05.304 --> 14:07.526
That's where his dad
beat his ass with the book.

14:07.527 --> 14:09.223
You don't
gotta bring it up.

14:09.224 --> 14:11.130
Could you imagine
being that kid opening that book

14:11.131 --> 14:12.197
for the first time?

14:12.198 --> 14:13.632
You're, like,
you get one story

14:13.633 --> 14:15.100
like, of spider-man
or something... you're, like,

14:15.101 --> 14:16.668
"whoa, that was amazing."

14:16.669 --> 14:18.170
Turn the page and then you're
into the world of daredevil.

14:18.171 --> 14:19.775
Then you turn the page you're
into the world of iron man.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.005
Putting them all
under one cover

14:21.006 --> 14:22.778
is just brilliant
marketing, man.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.697
Then close it and
you're back in the real world.

14:24.698 --> 14:25.944
Yeah.

14:25.945 --> 14:27.778
So you're looking
to make some cash.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.327
Yeah, I need
to get that cash,

14:29.328 --> 14:30.912
I gotta convert books
to cash right now because, um,

14:30.913 --> 14:33.247
I'm trying to fund
a dream, basically.

14:33.248 --> 14:34.584
I'm an aspiring
stand-up comedian.

14:34.585 --> 14:35.958
- So I want to...
- Really?

14:35.959 --> 14:37.187
Yeah, trying to.

14:37.188 --> 14:38.821
Uh, so I'm trying
to get a little cash

14:38.822 --> 14:40.338
so I can take some time
off work, just kinda...

14:40.339 --> 14:42.048
Devote all your time
to your craft.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.392
Trying to, yeah.

14:43.393 --> 14:45.061
Well, what are you
looking for for these five?

14:45.062 --> 14:47.136
For five of them
I'd like to get 400.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.632
- 400.
- 400.

14:48.633 --> 14:51.102
- So you want $80 a pop, huh?
- Just 400 for all of them.

14:51.103 --> 14:52.436
We don't have to really
even think about it too much

14:52.437 --> 14:53.971
I think...
Just, you know.

14:53.972 --> 14:55.940
Well, that's...
We have to think about it

14:55.941 --> 14:57.242
a little bit more
than you do.

14:57.243 --> 14:59.273
- Okay.
- What do you think, Mike?

14:59.274 --> 15:01.480
What do you think we can get
for the superhero women, Bry?

15:01.481 --> 15:02.915
This is all
the first appearances

15:02.916 --> 15:04.779
of all the great women
in marvel comics.

15:04.780 --> 15:06.452
- 60.
- 60, okay.

15:06.453 --> 15:08.955
Okay, <i>origins</i> is probably
the most sought after one

15:08.956 --> 15:10.743
'cause it has
all the big guns in it.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.329
The spine's
unfortunately, um, brittle.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.628
- Give me a number.
- Um...

15:15.629 --> 15:17.363
- 80.
<i>- America at war.</i>

15:17.364 --> 15:18.417
Um...

15:18.418 --> 15:20.576
- That actually...
- Rarity, 100.

15:20.577 --> 15:21.794
That's even more rare
than the superhero ones.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.673
- 100, 125.
- 100, okay.

15:23.674 --> 15:24.871
Uh, <i>bring on the bad guys</i>

15:24.872 --> 15:26.607
surprisingly
in really good shape.

15:26.608 --> 15:29.477
- Okay.
- Uh, 100, 125.

15:29.478 --> 15:31.445
All right, and then
the <i>son of the origins?</i>

15:31.446 --> 15:33.581
Um, this one...

15:33.582 --> 15:34.976
- 50.
- Okay.

15:34.977 --> 15:38.019
All right, so with that,
we're probably gonna get

15:38.020 --> 15:39.988
415 for these books here.

15:39.989 --> 15:41.649
Okay, that's great.
I'll take 415.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.425
Okay, well we're not...
Well, what are we gonna sell...

15:43.426 --> 15:45.327
You don't understand, we have
to make a profit on them.

15:45.328 --> 15:47.195
If we're gonna sell them
for $415, what's the best

15:47.196 --> 15:49.364
we can offer
this gentleman today?

15:49.365 --> 15:52.326
- 200.
- Uh...

15:52.327 --> 15:55.369
I think that's fair, 200.

15:55.370 --> 15:58.505
Can you do 375?

15:58.506 --> 15:59.907
I cannot.

15:59.908 --> 16:01.627
If we could do 350,

16:01.628 --> 16:02.776
that can help me
out a little bit.

16:02.777 --> 16:05.145
- We can do 2.
- Yeah.

16:05.146 --> 16:06.632
325?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.009
2.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.784
315?
Meet somewhere in the middle?

16:10.785 --> 16:11.846
2.

16:12.287 --> 16:13.420
What if he makes you laugh?

16:13.421 --> 16:15.055
Throw in that
extra couple bucks.

16:15.056 --> 16:16.434
It's not the easiest thing
in the world to make

16:16.435 --> 16:18.058
this guy laugh... you've
been working here ten years

16:18.059 --> 16:21.314
you haven't done it once.

16:21.315 --> 16:22.356
So...

16:22.357 --> 16:24.525
- 300 if you make me laugh.
- Whoa.

16:25.101 --> 16:27.653
- 200 if you don't.
- That sounds fair.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.864
Come on, you gotta have
confidence in your material.

16:29.865 --> 16:31.639
I know, people tell me that,
people tell me that.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.284
Before I even tried
to make <i>clerks,</i>

16:33.285 --> 16:35.743
I went one night
to do open Mike stand up.

16:35.744 --> 16:37.077
And I didn't tell anybody.

16:37.078 --> 16:38.412
I didn't tell you guys,
I didn't say anything

16:38.413 --> 16:39.713
'cause I was terrified.

16:39.714 --> 16:41.248
I didn't know
if I'd go up there and bomb

16:41.249 --> 16:42.516
and I didn't want,
like, you guys to be there

16:42.517 --> 16:43.750
the rest of my life
and be, like,

16:43.751 --> 16:45.285
"remember that time
you went up on stage?

16:45.286 --> 16:46.922
It was so terrible."

16:46.923 --> 16:48.716
- So I went by myself.
- How'd it feel?

16:48.717 --> 16:51.427
When I got off the stage,
I never wanted to go back.

16:51.428 --> 16:52.887
I was not, like,
this is what I wanna do.

16:52.888 --> 16:53.994
I was too intimidated

16:53.995 --> 16:55.729
and I realized
I could never deal

16:55.730 --> 16:57.183
with that kind of rejection.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.699
Wanna hold
a Mike or something?

16:58.700 --> 17:00.227
- Do you have...?
- Here hold these scissors.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.735
- Go right ahead.
- Um...

17:01.736 --> 17:03.837
Uh, I always thought,
uh, you know, Professor X

17:03.838 --> 17:06.358
made such a smart purchase
with the x-jet.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.736
Can you imagine being cyclops
waiting for Wolverine

17:08.737 --> 17:09.978
at airport security?

17:09.979 --> 17:12.180
"Hey bub, my skeleton's
made of metal,

17:12.181 --> 17:13.748
let me just walk through."

17:13.749 --> 17:17.553
"But you got
knives in your hand, Wolverine."

17:17.554 --> 17:20.890
"All the better
to poke you with, you old lady."

17:23.059 --> 17:24.660
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, boy.

17:24.661 --> 17:26.796
Uh-oh.

17:26.797 --> 17:29.382
He failed miserably.

17:29.383 --> 17:30.832
Why can't you have
a comic who just does

17:30.833 --> 17:33.334
"hey man, I saw spider-man
swinging by the other day."

17:33.335 --> 17:34.969
Exactly, that's
what I... I told the guy.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.305
I was, like, I think
you're on to something.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.672
Yeah, yeah.

17:37.673 --> 17:39.100
This guy was gonna be
the first comic book comedian.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.509
And I wouldn't be surprised
five years from now...

17:41.510 --> 17:43.562
If someone stole his idea
and did it better.

17:45.524 --> 17:47.315
All right,
you didn't make me laugh

17:47.316 --> 17:49.819
but what I said,
200 bucks, right?

17:49.820 --> 17:51.654
All right.

17:51.655 --> 17:53.114
All right, man.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.949
- Thank you.
- Thank you and...

17:55.324 --> 17:57.076
Work on it, 'cause I think
you are on to something.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.393
- Thank you, appreciate it.
- All right, man.

17:58.394 --> 18:00.746
- Good luck, man.
- Thank you.

18:02.098 --> 18:05.033
That was irresponsible of you
to give him a dime

18:05.034 --> 18:06.068
towards that dream.

18:10.973 --> 18:12.049
And action!

18:12.050 --> 18:13.775
So what kind of intense
am I bringing?

18:13.776 --> 18:16.429
- Am I, like...
- You're like a carnival barker.

18:16.430 --> 18:17.845
- That's who you are.
- Okay, so I'm like...

18:17.846 --> 18:20.481
Maybe I'll be, like...

18:20.932 --> 18:22.550
Mm-hm.
Yeah, like a spidey stance.

18:22.551 --> 18:23.985
- Okay.
- There you go.

18:23.986 --> 18:25.453
- All right.
- You ready?

18:25.454 --> 18:27.155
I'm ready.

18:27.156 --> 18:28.991
Action!

18:28.992 --> 18:30.860
We only don't have the best
selection of comics for sale,

18:30.861 --> 18:32.486
blah-LA-LA!

18:32.487 --> 18:34.030
Beep!

18:34.031 --> 18:36.824
We don't only have the best
selection of comics at... ooh.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.661
That's a mouthful, man.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.246
- Slow down.
- Is it ming's fault?

18:42.247 --> 18:43.941
- Is he shaking the cards?
- No.

18:43.942 --> 18:45.210
It's not ming's fault,
you know,

18:45.211 --> 18:46.459
I'm just
a little nervous.

18:46.460 --> 18:47.645
Give me one more
shot at this.

18:47.646 --> 18:50.014
Acting's harder
than you thought?

18:50.015 --> 18:51.505
- Of course.
- All right.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.217
If it was easy
everybody would be doing it.

18:53.218 --> 18:55.986
- All right, you ready?
- Ready.

18:55.987 --> 18:58.189
Action!

18:58.190 --> 18:59.990
We don't only have the best
selection of comics for sale

18:59.991 --> 19:01.859
at Jay and silent Bob's
secret stash!

19:01.860 --> 19:03.227
At Jay and silent Bob's
secret stash,

19:03.228 --> 19:06.604
<i>you</i> can sell
your comics for cash!

19:06.605 --> 19:08.272
Cut. Very good.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.834
Walt brought an energy
that you have not seen since,

19:10.835 --> 19:12.818
uh, the crazy Eddie commercials.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.239
- I was excited about this.
- That's a high bar to hit.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.541
Crazy Eddie
was a TV pitchman.

19:17.542 --> 19:19.877
They sold stereo
equipment, TVs...

19:19.878 --> 19:20.785
Electronics.

19:21.146 --> 19:22.412
But this dude was
on commercials he was, like,

19:22.413 --> 19:24.414
"it's crazy Eddie,
the prices are... insane!"

19:24.415 --> 19:26.916
He just worked that camera,
so that was the approach.

19:26.917 --> 19:30.044
The approach of, like, almost
a... crazy Walter.

19:31.455 --> 19:33.589
He has the eyes going,
he's got the psycho eyes.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.049
- Acting is all in the eyes.
- Yeah.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.802
And he had energy to spare.

19:38.162 --> 19:40.221
All right,
Walt, you ready?

19:40.222 --> 19:41.730
Action.

19:41.731 --> 19:43.098
It's no secret that
at the secret stash we've got

19:43.099 --> 19:45.801
the largest selection of comics
and comic related products

19:45.802 --> 19:47.202
in all of central Jersey.

19:47.203 --> 19:49.063
Nice, now do it again.
Beep!

19:49.064 --> 19:50.774
It's no secret
at the secret stash we've got

19:50.775 --> 19:53.277
the largest selection of comics
and comic-related products

19:53.278 --> 19:55.736
in all of central Jersey!

19:55.737 --> 19:58.349
- Cut! We're moving on.
- Beep! And action!

19:58.350 --> 19:59.850
You want
Jay and silent Bob?

19:59.851 --> 20:03.619
<i>Clerks, mallrats, clerks ii,
dogma,</i> and <i>Jersey girl?</i>

20:03.620 --> 20:05.496
Cut!
Moving on.

20:05.497 --> 20:06.591
Beep!

20:06.592 --> 20:08.082
All right,
so on this one, Mike,

20:08.083 --> 20:10.543
I need you to channel
your inner bettie page.

20:10.544 --> 20:12.795
Pretend you're
in some animal print

20:12.796 --> 20:13.963
and give me
one of these.

20:13.964 --> 20:15.465
- Okay, you ready?
- I am.

20:15.466 --> 20:17.967
Look at me now,
don't look at those cue cards.

20:17.968 --> 20:19.602
So you got directed
by Johnson.

20:19.603 --> 20:21.837
How did you find
being directed as an actor

20:21.838 --> 20:25.349
in the hands of a director,
<i>herr direktor,</i> Bryan Johnson?

20:25.350 --> 20:27.642
Bryan as a director
ruled with an iron fist.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.062
- Yeah.
- Crushed us under his heels.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.146
Yeah, it's all about
breaking the talent.

20:31.147 --> 20:32.447
- Not communicating with them.
- Yes.

20:32.448 --> 20:33.915
You've been
in that director's seat.

20:33.916 --> 20:36.652
Everybody has their ideas,
everybody has their own vision.

20:36.653 --> 20:39.188
Everyone's a cook,
everyone can direct.

20:39.189 --> 20:40.281
All right,
Mike, you ready?

20:40.282 --> 20:42.116
- Right.
- Saucy, alluring.

20:42.117 --> 20:43.560
Bettie page
if she were a dude.

20:43.561 --> 20:45.729
Give me the eyes, Mike.
Like, give me the eyes...

20:45.730 --> 20:46.763
- The bedroom eyes?
- Your bedroom... yeah.

20:46.764 --> 20:48.289
- Your bedroom eyes.
- Mm-hm.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.875
All right, action.

20:50.876 --> 20:53.470
You want action figures,
DVDs, collectibles,

20:53.471 --> 20:55.272
and active wear?

20:55.273 --> 20:56.714
We got that!

20:56.715 --> 20:58.575
- One more time.
- Wha...?

20:58.576 --> 20:59.943
- Faster.
- And spooky.

20:59.944 --> 21:02.879
And more intense... yeah,
I know, he looks creepy now.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.414
Yeah, you're not supposed
to scare people.

21:04.415 --> 21:05.649
Looks like you
should be thrown in jail.

21:05.650 --> 21:07.884
You're supposed to seduce them
into the stash.

21:07.885 --> 21:10.153
- Come on in.
- The seduction of the geeks.

21:10.154 --> 21:11.812
- We ready?
- We are.

21:11.813 --> 21:13.090
Action!

21:13.091 --> 21:14.624
Are you looking
for action figures, DVDs,

21:14.625 --> 21:16.793
collectibles, or active wear?

21:16.794 --> 21:19.797
We got that!

21:21.696 --> 21:23.574
Cut!
Very good.

21:23.575 --> 21:24.768
All right, Mike,
we're gonna dull

21:24.769 --> 21:26.035
the sexiness
a little bit.

21:26.036 --> 21:27.672
It's just...
It's oozing all over.

21:27.673 --> 21:31.498
It's gonna drip down
on ming in a second.

21:31.499 --> 21:32.910
Was he power mad?
Did he lose it?

21:32.911 --> 21:34.710
Was he drunk
with his own power?

21:34.711 --> 21:37.004
I mean, I love it
when you're passionate.

21:37.005 --> 21:39.017
I love it when you're
excited about something.

21:39.018 --> 21:40.818
But I mean you went way...
You went a little far.

21:40.819 --> 21:44.845
You know, he's saying this now
because there were three roles,

21:44.846 --> 21:46.430
three guys to fill those roles,

21:46.431 --> 21:48.599
but he still ended up
on the casting couch.

21:51.029 --> 21:53.264
This is truly,
like, a major find.

21:53.265 --> 21:54.313
The spine's
in great condition.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.768
Wait till you see
the other stuff.

21:56.769 --> 21:58.537
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

21:58.538 --> 22:01.406
I've had to let go
of a lot of things that are

22:01.407 --> 22:02.741
meaningful to me.

22:02.742 --> 22:05.282
There's only 500 pieces
of this in the world.

22:05.283 --> 22:08.577
You're selling it because
you just need the cash?

22:20.810 --> 22:23.879
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.314
Welcome to
Jay and silent Bob's.

22:25.315 --> 22:28.263
- What an unusual jacket.
- Thank you.

22:28.264 --> 22:32.017
I am interested
in selling this Megatron statue.

22:32.018 --> 22:35.191
Wouldn't you like to ask Walt
about his interesting hairdo?

22:35.192 --> 22:37.860
Speaking of hairdos...

22:37.861 --> 22:39.228
- What's the story here?
- What's going on?

22:39.229 --> 22:40.818
We don't see many people
walk in that look like

22:40.819 --> 22:42.098
a human butterfly.

22:42.099 --> 22:45.406
Well, uh, I had
always loved mohawks and...

22:45.407 --> 22:46.768
Do you have
to do it every day?

22:46.769 --> 22:49.201
Like if you sleep on it,
do you get, like, mohawk head?

22:49.202 --> 22:51.620
No, I can actually,
like put a t-shirt on

22:51.621 --> 22:53.789
and it'll just
pop right back into place.

22:53.790 --> 22:56.712
Can you turn around?
Can I see the back?

22:56.713 --> 22:57.947
Wow.

22:57.948 --> 23:00.749
I just look at it and I feel like
I'm in, like, some sort of, like...

23:00.750 --> 23:02.423
- Acid trip?
- Yeah, definitely.

23:02.918 --> 23:04.508
That is a piece of work.

23:04.509 --> 23:05.954
- All right.
- Back to the transformers.

23:05.955 --> 23:07.722
Back to
the transformer statue.

23:12.807 --> 23:15.060
There's only 500 pieces
of this in the world, Bryan.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.297
Mm-hm.

23:16.298 --> 23:17.999
See the transformers,
it's my thing.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.500
You a big transformers fan?

23:19.501 --> 23:21.269
I've always been
a big transformers fan,

23:21.270 --> 23:22.401
ever since
I was little.

23:22.402 --> 23:23.360
Mm-hm.

23:23.706 --> 23:27.241
- What are you looking for?
- Between 100-150.

23:27.242 --> 23:28.976
Why don't we give you
a little tip.

23:28.977 --> 23:30.743
I hang around here,
I watch things.

23:30.744 --> 23:34.371
When you come in to negotiate,
you can't say between 100 to 150

23:34.372 --> 23:36.316
'cause right away,
a shark is gonna

23:36.317 --> 23:37.483
smell that blood
in the water.

23:37.484 --> 23:38.785
He knows
you're gonna take 100.

23:38.786 --> 23:40.794
So boom!
You're down to 100 already.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.463
Transformer market
for this piece...

23:42.464 --> 23:44.223
I'm afraid that
if I buy it

23:44.224 --> 23:45.966
I might only
get 65 bucks for it,

23:45.967 --> 23:48.394
so the best
I could do for you today

23:48.395 --> 23:50.696
is $50 cash.

23:50.697 --> 23:53.065
I know that's less
than what you paid for it but...

23:53.066 --> 23:55.267
And less than the gas money
it took to get here.

24:00.241 --> 24:01.482
Uh-oh,
she's gonna pull

24:01.483 --> 24:04.860
the pretty chick
crying routine, Walt.

24:04.861 --> 24:06.987
She was doing
what a lot of girls do,

24:06.988 --> 24:08.449
trying to use... would
you say her feminine wiles?

24:08.450 --> 24:10.317
- Trying to get you to, uh...
- Was she using sex as a weapon?

24:10.318 --> 24:12.117
- A little bit.
- Really.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.353
- She had no idea that...
- I don't think so.

24:13.354 --> 24:15.222
Dude has armor.
You don't think so?

24:15.223 --> 24:16.623
What? You thought...
For that hair...

24:16.624 --> 24:17.658
No, not the hair.

24:17.659 --> 24:19.327
She was pretending
she was crying

24:19.328 --> 24:21.543
and she was giving you the lip,
mmm... like that.

24:21.544 --> 24:23.754
You think you're gonna bat
your eyelashes and get 10% off?

24:23.755 --> 24:25.032
Ladies and gentlemen,

24:25.033 --> 24:26.801
the Taliban
of the comic book community

24:26.802 --> 24:28.342
sits at our table.

24:28.343 --> 24:30.135
I'm, like,
I wanna service that guy.

24:30.136 --> 24:33.722
Whoa!

24:34.277 --> 24:37.309
- Boom.
- Done!

24:37.310 --> 24:39.645
You're breaking
my heart, man.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.349
- Yeah, tears won't do it.
- Oh.

24:41.350 --> 24:44.066
Um, you're selling it
because you just need the cash?

24:44.387 --> 24:45.587
Or you just...

24:45.588 --> 24:47.822
I've been, uh,
working on my gallery.

24:47.823 --> 24:50.030
And pretty much every penny
that I make, uh,

24:50.526 --> 24:51.793
goes into the gallery.

24:51.794 --> 24:55.196
So I've had to let go
of a lot of things

24:55.197 --> 24:56.531
that are meaningful to me.

24:56.532 --> 24:59.706
Like pride, dignity,
that sort of thing.

24:59.707 --> 25:01.625
I'm not turning tricks yet,
so I'm grateful for that.

25:01.626 --> 25:03.337
Really?
How did you manage that?

25:03.338 --> 25:05.212
'Cause I am.

25:05.213 --> 25:07.942
So I can offer you
a little bit more, then, for it,

25:07.943 --> 25:09.466
just because I do feel

25:09.467 --> 25:11.312
you're gonna
put it to a good cause.

25:11.313 --> 25:14.949
- A gallery, starving artist.
- Are you starving?

25:14.950 --> 25:16.140
- Yeah?
- All right.

25:16.141 --> 25:18.934
$65, cash.

25:18.935 --> 25:20.310
- To break even.
- Sold.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.771
Sold?
You got a deal.

25:22.772 --> 25:24.314
What an investor.

25:24.315 --> 25:26.650
For those of you
that don't know, Walter

25:26.651 --> 25:28.028
is a comic book artist.

25:28.029 --> 25:30.863
This dude's actually drawn
some really legit stuff.

25:30.864 --> 25:32.072
Is it hard
to separate yourself?

25:32.073 --> 25:34.602
As an artist,
here's this one side

25:34.603 --> 25:37.138
but then it's the hardnosed
businessman on this side?

25:37.139 --> 25:42.343
I'm always gonna count myself
as a businessman first.

25:42.344 --> 25:43.417
Artist second.

25:43.746 --> 25:46.348
That's why she walked away
with 65 instead of 95?

25:46.349 --> 25:47.749
- Yeah.
- I mean, you couldn't spare

25:47.750 --> 25:50.257
another 25, 35
for the cause of the arts?

25:50.258 --> 25:52.588
I gave her 65 bucks.

25:52.589 --> 25:53.635
Um...

25:53.636 --> 25:55.157
That's the soul
of a true artist.

25:55.158 --> 25:57.431
"I always like to think
I'm a businessman first."

25:58.641 --> 26:02.519
"Poetry of art in my soul
is very secondary."

26:10.106 --> 26:12.374
- What do you got?
- Superhero-type stuff.

26:12.375 --> 26:13.909
- Tights.
- All right.

26:14.364 --> 26:16.158
You got a nice rear,
so that'll work

26:16.159 --> 26:17.242
and boom!

26:17.243 --> 26:19.414
- Yeah.
- Look at that.

26:19.415 --> 26:21.580
Reinforced crotch, you don't
gotta worry about anything.

26:21.581 --> 26:24.458
- I'm not wearing blue panties.
- Come on, let's go downstairs.

26:24.459 --> 26:25.876
Get you changed.

26:25.877 --> 26:28.837
- You're not coming with me.
- Get down there.

26:29.390 --> 26:31.798
I know how small it is,
don't worry about it.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.627
The commercial
was my brainchild,

26:33.628 --> 26:35.996
I'll have to admit
and, um, I had the idea

26:35.997 --> 26:40.807
of creating a price agitator.
A price mxyzptlk.

26:40.808 --> 26:43.070
To show the people
that we like to charge

26:43.071 --> 26:44.770
fair prices
for our products.

26:44.771 --> 26:45.938
Yes!

26:45.939 --> 26:48.232
- And we came up with price mite.
- The price mite's a villain.

26:48.233 --> 26:49.983
That's all
he wants to do is...

26:49.984 --> 26:52.653
I don't know how he would do it,
but he marks up your product

26:52.654 --> 26:54.238
within your own store.

26:54.239 --> 26:56.114
Oh, my God.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.252
- The worst villain there is.
- Yeah, that's it.

26:58.253 --> 26:59.687
Just when you think
you've got a fair price,

26:59.688 --> 27:01.328
the price mite comes along
and Jacks it up?

27:01.329 --> 27:02.663
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

27:02.664 --> 27:05.093
Yeah.

27:05.094 --> 27:06.661
I know you guys
have been waiting

27:06.662 --> 27:07.929
for a little bit.

27:07.930 --> 27:10.065
Every once in a while
a new character is created

27:10.066 --> 27:14.633
that will have the longevity of
say, a superman, a Batman.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.176
I think I've done it.

27:16.177 --> 27:18.275
With no further delay...

27:18.276 --> 27:20.931
I give you
America's newest super villain.

27:21.412 --> 27:22.546
Price mite!

27:22.547 --> 27:25.349
Aah!
Ha-ha-ha!

27:25.350 --> 27:27.938
I am the price mite.
Scourge of the store!

27:27.939 --> 27:30.482
Aah! Aah! Aah!

27:30.483 --> 27:32.891
You create a character,
you see it come to life.

27:32.892 --> 27:34.393
It's gotta feel good.

27:34.394 --> 27:36.405
Yeah, yeah, I mean,
it wasn't the, uh...

27:36.406 --> 27:39.032
No thrill of creation?
No... like, "yeah, yeah."

27:39.033 --> 27:41.500
At first I thought
they'd be superheroes

27:41.501 --> 27:43.537
but then I was just, like,
"he doesn't look very heroic."

27:43.538 --> 27:45.137
- Right.
- You know?

27:47.083 --> 27:49.042
I'm not just saying that
to bust your chops.

27:49.543 --> 27:52.177
I'm just saying,
you're more like an imp.

27:52.178 --> 27:53.880
- You're more like...
- A pixie.

27:53.881 --> 27:55.781
- Yeah.
- A fairy, if you will.

27:55.782 --> 27:56.466
Yeah.

27:56.949 --> 27:59.094
Every super villain
needs a super-accessory.

27:59.095 --> 28:01.263
- Oh, my God.
- You're all smooth.

28:01.264 --> 28:03.454
- It's creepy.
- The scourge of the store.

28:03.455 --> 28:05.142
The enemy of the consumer.

28:05.143 --> 28:06.810
You're sure about that?
You're gonna wear that?

28:06.811 --> 28:07.686
Yeah.

28:08.125 --> 28:10.058
Well, let's shoot
some stuff with it.

28:10.059 --> 28:11.293
Shoot some, uh,
some price mite action?

28:11.294 --> 28:13.191
I keep staring at your bikini,
man, it's weird.

28:13.562 --> 28:14.829
Ready to go to work,
price mite?

28:14.830 --> 28:16.064
Let's go to work.

28:16.065 --> 28:19.232
Come on, price mite,
let's see what you got.

28:19.233 --> 28:20.949
600 is what
I could get for them.

28:20.950 --> 28:22.326
You can make
more than that on this.

28:22.327 --> 28:25.412
- No way.
- You're 100% lying.

28:25.413 --> 28:27.339
This one's
kind of really cool.

28:27.340 --> 28:28.874
- Ooh-ho-ho.
- Holy God.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.125
I've gotta
hold myself up here.

28:30.126 --> 28:32.211
My knees are shaking so bad.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.930
I went to take
my kid to school the other day,

28:36.931 --> 28:38.932
drop her off
at the bus stop.

28:38.933 --> 28:41.803
And I was wearing
a pair of Batman boxer shorts.

28:41.804 --> 28:43.903
They had the big bat signals
all over them.

28:43.904 --> 28:45.305
When I say big I mean real big,

28:45.306 --> 28:47.142
'cause I got them
from the fat guy store.

28:49.270 --> 28:51.043
So I'm wearing some
fat guy Batman shorts,

28:51.044 --> 28:53.179
driving the kid to school,
and I look at the gauge

28:53.180 --> 28:54.483
and I see that
I'm almost on empty.

28:54.484 --> 28:57.152
So her bus stop
is at a gas station.

28:57.153 --> 28:58.984
So I pull up to the pump
and I go to get out, she's...

28:58.985 --> 28:59.988
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

28:59.989 --> 29:01.819
My 12-year-old kid
literally stops me.

29:01.820 --> 29:03.254
I said, "what's the matter?"

29:03.255 --> 29:04.618
And she's going
"don't go out wearing those."

29:04.619 --> 29:06.590
And I was, like,
"the Batman shorts?"

29:06.591 --> 29:08.025
She goes, like,
"yeah," I was, like,

29:08.026 --> 29:10.957
of my entire clownish attire,
it's the Batman shorts

29:11.396 --> 29:12.763
that you object to?

29:12.764 --> 29:14.599
And she didn't want kids
from her school seeing that

29:14.600 --> 29:15.754
I was a comics guy.

29:15.755 --> 29:17.089
Which was weird
'cause I'm, like,

29:17.090 --> 29:18.436
"you name is harley Quinn.

29:18.437 --> 29:21.134
"We named you after
a Batman villainess.

29:21.135 --> 29:23.341
"If you had been a boy you
would have been Batman Smith

29:23.342 --> 29:24.943
"instead of harley Quinn Smith.

29:24.944 --> 29:27.682
So why you're objecting
to these shorts is beyond me."

29:33.923 --> 29:34.956
You guys ever
thought about doing

29:34.957 --> 29:36.858
a more mainstream comic book?

29:36.859 --> 29:38.959
You guys have done two...
<i>Karney, war of the undead.</i>

29:38.960 --> 29:42.155
Not really
everybody's cup of tea.

29:42.156 --> 29:43.864
What do you mean
"not everybody's cup of tea"?

29:43.865 --> 29:45.365
All right, "karney..."

29:45.366 --> 29:46.701
There's nothing
that's everybody's cup of tea.

29:46.702 --> 29:49.454
What's your great mainstream
idea for a comic book?

29:49.455 --> 29:52.499
I don't know, short, Asian,
not great with the ladies.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.084
Just, you know, an everyman...

29:54.085 --> 29:56.043
How arrogant is that, though,
to think that you think

29:56.044 --> 29:57.378
your life story
is worthy

29:57.379 --> 29:59.256
to be put onto
a comic book page.

29:59.257 --> 30:00.841
Do you have powers,
or is it just you?

30:00.842 --> 30:02.183
I don't know.

30:02.184 --> 30:03.969
Like a great superpower,
like, controlling technology.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.454
Fail!

30:05.455 --> 30:07.890
Everybody uses social media
and the Internet and websites.

30:07.891 --> 30:10.142
How about somebody
who can control all that?

30:10.143 --> 30:12.160
A superhero who's,
like, awesome at Facebook?

30:15.197 --> 30:17.232
- What's goin' on?
- What can we do for you today?

30:17.233 --> 30:18.608
Uh, I'm actually here
to sell some comics.

30:18.609 --> 30:20.610
Sweet.
Let's see what you got.

30:20.611 --> 30:22.946
I've got the marvel
<i>secret</i> wars, the whole set.

30:28.492 --> 30:29.612
What was <i>secret wars?</i>

30:29.613 --> 30:30.780
All the villains
in the marvel universe,

30:30.781 --> 30:32.914
all the heroes
brought to another world

30:32.915 --> 30:37.627
and forced to battle
for an alien entity's whimsy.

30:37.628 --> 30:39.290
One big battle royale.

30:39.291 --> 30:41.659
It's like
professional wrestling.

30:41.660 --> 30:43.093
These are yours?

30:43.094 --> 30:45.495
I was actually in, uh, Brooklyn
and some guy was selling these

30:45.496 --> 30:48.221
at a garage sale,
and he had no idea what he had.

30:48.222 --> 30:50.267
This is the big boy
in the lot right here.

30:50.268 --> 30:53.504
This was a big deal
because, um, in 1984

30:53.505 --> 30:56.188
it was the very first time
spider-man had ever changed

30:56.189 --> 30:57.242
his red and blue costume.

30:57.243 --> 30:58.940
He changed to all black.

30:58.941 --> 31:00.525
Let's talk about
the black costume.

31:00.526 --> 31:03.315
I remember the black costume
being very cool

31:03.316 --> 31:05.489
when I was a kid...
You were, like, "oh, my lord!"

31:05.490 --> 31:08.320
Like it's the absence of all
color covering spider-man.

31:08.321 --> 31:10.388
There's no blue,
there's no red, there's no webs.

31:10.389 --> 31:12.524
It was just basically
him black with a white spider.

31:12.525 --> 31:13.958
But for some reason
it really worked

31:13.959 --> 31:15.593
and captured
people's imagination

31:15.594 --> 31:17.209
and you liked it
the first time?

31:17.210 --> 31:18.835
Well, yeah,
he looked bad-ass.

31:18.836 --> 31:20.128
- Right.
- All of a sudden, you know?

31:20.129 --> 31:22.967
He looked like he was mean
and, uh, he could

31:22.968 --> 31:24.508
come out of the shadows.

31:24.509 --> 31:26.635
Kind of like, you know,
a much darker spider-man

31:27.205 --> 31:28.386
than everybody
was used to.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.274
It was a really
cool thing, man.

31:30.275 --> 31:33.277
What are you looking for
for the entire set?

31:35.614 --> 31:38.438
About, you know, 700-800?

31:38.439 --> 31:41.316
It looks like $600
is what I could get for them.

31:41.317 --> 31:42.588
You can make more
than that on this.

31:42.589 --> 31:44.256
You could definitely
sell these for 1,000.

31:44.257 --> 31:45.958
- No way.
- Definitely.

31:45.959 --> 31:48.031
The market right now
says I can only afford

31:48.562 --> 31:52.332
to buy the set
for what will be 300.

31:52.333 --> 31:53.733
That's impossible.

31:53.734 --> 31:55.902
I would go down to 550 for these
and I could leave right now.

31:55.903 --> 31:57.236
I came all the way
down from Brooklyn.

31:57.237 --> 31:58.471
You can leave
any time you want.

31:58.472 --> 32:00.418
That doesn't matter.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.541
Obviously you guys
are gonna sell it for more.

32:01.542 --> 32:02.837
I'm not stupid.
You're not gonna...

32:02.838 --> 32:04.043
You really believe that

32:04.044 --> 32:05.298
we're not gonna
sell it for 600?

32:05.299 --> 32:07.759
100%.
You're 100% lying.

32:07.760 --> 32:08.927
I don't lie to customers.

32:08.928 --> 32:12.051
I'll give you 300
for the whole series.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.089
If you go up to 400,

32:17.090 --> 32:19.312
I'll leave now
without being annoying.

32:19.313 --> 32:20.393
Too late.

32:21.962 --> 32:23.191
350.

32:23.192 --> 32:25.699
350, and I'll walk away.

32:25.700 --> 32:27.571
- It's getting closer.
- 300.

32:28.136 --> 32:30.365
You're really
not gonna go up $50?

32:30.366 --> 32:32.617
My feeling is you got these
at a garage sale,

32:32.618 --> 32:34.369
you probably paid
less than 10 bucks for them.

32:34.370 --> 32:37.843
I know. I'm not gonna say.
Why would I say that?

32:37.844 --> 32:39.344
310. 310,
and I swear to God

32:39.345 --> 32:42.085
if giving you
that 310 would be...

32:42.086 --> 32:44.504
315 just to pay
for the $15 train ticket here.

32:44.505 --> 32:46.339
Go down to 310.
What's another $5?

32:46.340 --> 32:47.752
What's another $5?
Exactly.

32:47.753 --> 32:51.678
I'll buy it for 300
and sell it to him for 310.

32:51.679 --> 32:53.555
Make a nice $10 profit.

32:53.556 --> 32:54.859
You're supposed
to be my yes-man.

32:54.860 --> 32:56.929
If you're not my yes-man,
you're useless.

32:56.930 --> 32:58.297
I'm kidding,
it's a joke.

32:58.298 --> 32:59.699
It's not funny.

32:59.700 --> 33:01.479
I came in here thinking
I'm gonna get around 700.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.024
Now I'm dropping down
to 400, 350...

33:04.025 --> 33:05.872
- 310.
- 310.

33:05.873 --> 33:07.374
It's hard to be
on this side of the counter.

33:07.375 --> 33:08.809
I see that disappointment
where people come in

33:08.810 --> 33:11.573
and they overvalue
what they have.

33:11.574 --> 33:14.814
- All right, fine.
- You've offended him.

33:19.119 --> 33:20.665
Yeah, I don't
appreciate your attitude.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.208
- You folded, man.
- What attitude?

33:22.209 --> 33:23.555
Come on, man,
don't you think,

33:23.556 --> 33:25.523
like, when Donald trump
is negotiating he has somebody

33:25.524 --> 33:26.624
over his shoulder
being, like,

33:26.625 --> 33:27.925
"I'll give you $10 more."

33:30.162 --> 33:31.663
I'm sure that happens
all the time.

33:31.664 --> 33:34.429
If I say the sky
is green, you say...

33:34.430 --> 33:35.833
- How green?
- Right.

33:35.834 --> 33:37.802
You should have preemptively
said the sky is green.

33:40.340 --> 33:41.978
Hi, guys.

33:41.979 --> 33:44.773
He walked out,
then five seconds later

33:44.774 --> 33:46.858
- came back in and...
- Shot ming in the chest.

33:49.951 --> 33:52.853
Walt literally
handed him the register.

33:52.854 --> 33:55.022
I'll take 310 for it.

33:55.023 --> 33:58.203
- You've made a wise decision.
- Well, thank you.

34:01.330 --> 34:03.166
All right.

34:03.167 --> 34:06.334
- Well, thank you, guys.
- Enjoy.

34:06.335 --> 34:08.213
- Later.
- What color is the sky?

34:08.214 --> 34:10.465
The sky's green, sir.

34:10.466 --> 34:13.775
What color is your nose?

34:13.777 --> 34:15.643
Today it's brown,
I guess.

34:23.652 --> 34:25.063
Action!

34:25.063 --> 34:26.489
It's no secret that...

34:26.489 --> 34:27.989
You'll walk in a zero

34:27.991 --> 34:30.559
- and walk out a hero.
- And walk out a superhero.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.460
- Aw,.
- Cut.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.614
You guys must
want to go out of business.

34:35.965 --> 34:37.565
Is that what the commercial
is for, ming?

34:37.565 --> 34:40.502
- A going-out-of-business sale?
- No.

34:40.503 --> 34:41.936
- Pathetic showing.
- That is my fault.

34:41.937 --> 34:44.623
These guys are awesome.
I screwed that up.

34:44.625 --> 34:46.208
Synch.
Stay in synch.

34:46.210 --> 34:48.712
If you're gonna do a local
spot you gotta have some unison.

34:48.713 --> 34:50.588
If there's more than
one person in the spot, yes,

34:50.589 --> 34:53.800
there is always "we end
the commercial together."

34:53.801 --> 34:55.516
I knew that was gonna
be a stumbling block.

34:55.516 --> 34:57.118
You think
I didn't know that?

34:57.119 --> 34:59.120
I wasn't aware...
You should have told me.

35:00.224 --> 35:02.016
And action!

35:02.017 --> 35:03.926
It's no secret that...

35:03.927 --> 35:05.428
You'll walk in a zero...

35:05.429 --> 35:07.564
- And walk out a superhero.
- And walk out a hero.

35:07.565 --> 35:08.966
Action!

35:08.967 --> 35:12.068
- You'll walk in a superhero...
- What the!

35:12.069 --> 35:14.446
- Action!
- You'll walk in a zero...

35:14.447 --> 35:16.240
And walk out a superhero...

35:16.241 --> 35:17.976
- And walk out a superzero!
- And walk out a zero!

35:17.977 --> 35:19.909
Come on!

35:19.910 --> 35:21.379
Sometimes you gotta
treat them like puppets.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.548
Just put your hand up
and work their mouths.

35:23.549 --> 35:24.664
Waah-waah-waah-waah!

35:26.051 --> 35:27.167
It was a lot harder
than I thought it would be.

35:27.168 --> 35:28.519
This is gonna be
the last time.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.155
- I can feel it now.
- All right, this is the one.

35:30.156 --> 35:31.923
I can feel it.
I promise this is the one.

35:31.924 --> 35:33.423
Come on.
Get energized, man.

35:33.424 --> 35:34.893
- Come on, let's do this.
- All right, let's go!

35:34.894 --> 35:36.069
Come on.
Come on, Mike.

35:36.070 --> 35:37.372
- Yeah!
- All right.

35:37.373 --> 35:39.097
- This'll be it.
- Hunh!

35:39.098 --> 35:41.765
- Aah!
- We can all go home.

35:41.766 --> 35:43.933
And... action!

35:43.934 --> 35:45.636
It's no secret that...

35:45.637 --> 35:47.372
You'll walk in a zero...

35:47.373 --> 35:50.941
And walk out
a superhero!

35:52.900 --> 35:54.027
Cut!

35:54.028 --> 35:55.945
Lady, what are you
doing to me?

35:57.016 --> 35:59.951
You walked in my shot!

36:04.490 --> 36:07.081
I have some old books
that I got from my grandmother.

36:07.592 --> 36:08.859
How old are we talking?

36:08.860 --> 36:11.862
This is gonna call
for white glove treatment.

36:16.966 --> 36:17.842
Breathtaking.

36:24.306 --> 36:25.239
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doing?

36:25.240 --> 36:26.640
- How you doing?
- Good.

36:26.641 --> 36:28.645
- Cool.
- Tom, how's it going?

36:28.646 --> 36:29.944
- Walter.
- Walter, nice to meet you.

36:29.945 --> 36:31.245
- This is Mike.
- Welcome to Jay and Bob's.

36:31.246 --> 36:32.513
- Thank you.
- What do you got?

36:32.514 --> 36:36.110
I have some old books
that I got from my grandmother.

36:36.111 --> 36:38.655
I know there's some stuff
in here that's pretty old.

36:38.656 --> 36:40.756
So I was wondering if maybe
you guys could help me out here.

36:40.757 --> 36:43.034
Okay, sure, definitely.
Let's take a look.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.793
Don't see many
golden age come through.

36:44.794 --> 36:45.829
No, not here.

36:46.196 --> 36:49.732
This is gonna call for,
uh, the white glove treatment.

36:51.377 --> 36:53.670
- So right off the bat.
- Ooh!

36:54.071 --> 36:55.380
<i>World's best comics,</i>
number 1.

36:55.381 --> 36:56.965
Oh, my God.

37:02.511 --> 37:04.114
The spine's
in great condition.

37:04.115 --> 37:05.148
- A major find, it is.
- It's a rarity.

37:05.149 --> 37:06.641
It's in really nice shape.

37:06.642 --> 37:08.601
I'll just pull
all three of these out.

37:08.602 --> 37:11.354
- <i>Superman,</i> breaking the chains.
- Wow.

37:17.027 --> 37:18.994
And then there's
<i>superman</i> number 12.

37:18.995 --> 37:21.155
He's walking arm-in-arm
with a sailor and a soldier.

37:26.994 --> 37:30.205
And then <i>superman</i> number 14.
This is America right here.

37:30.206 --> 37:31.249
- Yeah.
- You know?

37:37.087 --> 37:39.716
- That is actually awesome.
- It's amazing.

37:39.717 --> 37:42.316
- <i>All-star comics,</i> number 8.
- Ooh.

37:42.317 --> 37:44.885
- You know what this one is.
- First wonder woman.

37:44.886 --> 37:46.086
That's the first
appearance of wonder woman?

37:46.087 --> 37:46.973
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

37:52.436 --> 37:53.521
I actually had no idea.

37:53.522 --> 37:55.128
She's not
on the cover anywhere,

37:55.129 --> 37:57.163
but there's a short story
of wonder woman in here.

37:57.164 --> 37:59.098
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:59.099 --> 38:00.695
If, you know,
if you wanna take it out...

38:00.696 --> 38:03.698
- No.
- No, no, no, no, no.

38:03.699 --> 38:06.910
Wow, this is amazing.
I mean, what else do you have?

38:06.911 --> 38:08.675
Wait till you
see the other stuff.

38:09.161 --> 38:10.777
This one's
kind of really cool.

38:10.778 --> 38:13.583
- <i>Detective comics</i> number 38.
- Oh, my God.

38:19.421 --> 38:21.591
Holy God.

38:21.592 --> 38:23.825
I've seen pictures of it,
but I've never actually seen

38:23.826 --> 38:25.887
<i>detective comics</i> 38.

38:25.888 --> 38:28.348
It's the first
appearance of Robin.

38:28.349 --> 38:30.058
It's amazing.

38:30.059 --> 38:32.810
It's gotta be in the top 25 most
valuable comics in the world.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.562
For real?
Like, seriously?

38:34.563 --> 38:37.105
- Yeah.
- That is so cool.

38:37.106 --> 38:39.275
I mean, look at Batman's belt.
It's blue.

38:39.276 --> 38:40.709
Yeah.

38:40.710 --> 38:43.612
You know that Robin was
the start of the sidekick craze

38:43.613 --> 38:45.990
and he spawned
a legion of followers

38:45.991 --> 38:49.202
like, uh, bucky,
toro the flaming kid,

38:49.203 --> 38:50.367
Roy the super boy.

38:50.911 --> 38:53.164
- Oh, wow.
- Aqualad, I mean... yeah.

38:53.165 --> 38:56.084
It's an absolutely
breathtaking collection.

38:56.560 --> 38:57.961
Thank you, thank you.

38:57.962 --> 38:59.671
You are sitting
on a goldmine here, though.

38:59.672 --> 39:01.833
That's awesome.
That's really awesome to hear.

39:01.834 --> 39:04.869
I wouldn't even worry about
a middleman, selling to a store.

39:04.870 --> 39:08.471
I would bring them right
to the premiere auction house

39:08.472 --> 39:09.874
for selling comic books.

39:09.875 --> 39:11.776
We go through christie's
or is it heritage?

39:11.777 --> 39:13.744
- Heritage.
- Can you estimate a value?

39:13.745 --> 39:15.395
Like, just
by looking at these books?

39:15.396 --> 39:17.048
I couldn't right
off the top of my head.

39:17.521 --> 39:20.218
I mean, you're talking already
tens of thousands of dollars.

39:20.219 --> 39:21.192
- At the least.
- At least.

39:21.193 --> 39:23.361
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:23.362 --> 39:24.988
How much money they have
in that box you think?

39:24.989 --> 39:28.626
- At least $750,000.
- Get outta here.

39:28.627 --> 39:29.727
Yeah.

39:29.728 --> 39:31.462
You don't walk around
just, like...

39:31.463 --> 39:32.730
Well, you don't walk around
with that,

39:32.731 --> 39:34.199
but you don't walk into
our store with that.

39:34.200 --> 39:35.500
I know.
But he didn't know.

39:35.501 --> 39:37.035
That's it, now he knows.

39:37.036 --> 39:38.770
Years from now when
he's retired on the billions

39:38.771 --> 39:40.461
he's made from selling
his collection

39:40.462 --> 39:42.641
he'll be, like, "you know,
I once walked into this weird"

39:42.642 --> 39:45.883
"little comic book store
in red bank and was given

39:45.884 --> 39:47.645
this excellent
piece of advice."

39:48.637 --> 39:49.929
Thanks a lot.

39:49.930 --> 39:51.115
Thank you for
bringing them in,

39:51.116 --> 39:53.474
and it was an honor to look
at your collection today.

39:53.475 --> 39:55.219
Oh, no problem.
I really appreciate it.

39:55.220 --> 39:57.988
It's a collection that's
once-in-a-lifetime for us,

39:57.989 --> 39:59.522
I think, to see someone
come in with a box like this.

39:59.523 --> 40:02.493
Yes, it's true, you've
made two comic geeks very happy.

40:02.494 --> 40:03.627
- That's awesome.
- Have a good day, man.

40:03.628 --> 40:05.329
You too.
Best of luck with that.

40:05.330 --> 40:06.696
- Thanks a lot.
- I'm telling you, man.

40:06.697 --> 40:08.239
I literally gotta
hold myself up here.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.701
My knees are shaking so bad

40:09.702 --> 40:11.325
just from looking
at those comics.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.494
Those were beautiful.

40:13.495 --> 40:14.906
You collect
for years and years

40:14.907 --> 40:16.789
and you never think
you're gonna hold

40:16.790 --> 40:18.082
the first appearance
of wonder woman.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.417
No.

40:19.418 --> 40:21.127
Or as a comic book collector
even hold a woman.

40:21.128 --> 40:23.129
But, um...

40:28.854 --> 40:30.187
All right, man.
I've heard about it.

40:30.188 --> 40:32.355
I've laughed about it.
Now it's time to see it.

40:32.356 --> 40:34.307
Can I see the spot?
Let me see the commercial.

40:34.308 --> 40:35.592
- I got it right here.
- Okay.

40:35.593 --> 40:36.893
It's the director's cut, too.

40:36.894 --> 40:39.854
So it's an extended version.

40:39.855 --> 40:43.024
Hit the space bar,
and we're good.

40:43.025 --> 40:45.267
