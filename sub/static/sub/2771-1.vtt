01:13.257 --> 01:14.757
Better hurry.

01:26.186 --> 01:27.687
Here you go, my friend.

01:27.771 --> 01:30.273
Make sure you get us
as close as you can!

01:30.399 --> 01:33.693
I'll give you something extra
if you make it a good trip.

01:33.777 --> 01:36.153
Hey, I'm going to get
you close, my friend,

01:36.238 --> 01:38.698
but not too close, eh?
You don't want to be eaten.

01:40.284 --> 01:41.492
Ready, amigo?

01:41.618 --> 01:42.869
Ready!

01:47.749 --> 01:50.793
One, two, three!

01:59.761 --> 02:01.387
Eric, heave!

02:14.943 --> 02:16.235
Scared?

02:16.612 --> 02:18.154
Uh-uh. This is great.

02:31.126 --> 02:32.752
See anything yet?

02:32.961 --> 02:34.670
No, not yet.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.702
What was that?
I don't know.

03:10.832 --> 03:12.625
- Hold on!
- What's happening?

03:12.709 --> 03:13.876
Just hold on!

03:15.337 --> 03:16.963
Make it stop!

03:22.010 --> 03:23.469
What happened to them?

03:23.553 --> 03:27.640
- I don't know.
- Oh, my God.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.309
We're going to crash!
No, we're not.

03:31.853 --> 03:33.562
I'm going to
cut this loose!

03:33.647 --> 03:35.648
Let go of the rope!
We're gonna crash!

03:37.484 --> 03:38.734
Move your hands!

03:39.820 --> 03:41.070
Come on!

03:43.824 --> 03:45.366
Here we go!

03:55.877 --> 03:57.420
It's going be okay, bud.

04:17.733 --> 04:19.524
Charlie, those
are herbivores.

04:19.608 --> 04:21.652
They wouldn't
fight each other.

04:21.737 --> 04:25.031
But these are carnivores, and they
really like fighting each other.

04:25.115 --> 04:29.035
They use their teeth and their claws
to rip each other's throats out.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.788
Alan, he's three.
Let's wait till he's five.

04:34.124 --> 04:35.666
Right.
Sorry, Charlie.

04:35.751 --> 04:37.376
- Ellie?
- Yeah?

04:37.461 --> 04:40.296
It's Tom. He says he has to talk
to you about the last chapter.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.548
Tell him I won't lose
the Jack Horner quote.

04:42.674 --> 04:44.884
My editor thinks
he's a paleontologist.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.053
Hey, Mark!

04:47.137 --> 04:49.638
Hey, babe,
look who's here.

04:51.308 --> 04:52.808
This is Alan.

04:53.143 --> 04:55.644
Nice to meet you, Alan.

04:55.729 --> 04:59.398
Daddy, this is a herbivore
and that's the dinosaur man.

04:59.483 --> 05:01.275
Dinosaur man?

05:01.818 --> 05:04.945
Jack, say my name.
Is my name Alan?

05:05.655 --> 05:07.281
Is my name Alan?

05:10.619 --> 05:12.036
He used to know me.

05:14.498 --> 05:16.665
It's sad, huh?
Here you go.

05:17.125 --> 05:20.336
Thanks. Mark's been working
for the State Department now.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.671
What do they do, Mark?

05:22.839 --> 05:25.299
International relations, mostly
treaty law, things like that.

05:26.635 --> 05:27.676
Uh-oh!

05:27.761 --> 05:29.637
Call of the wild one.
Here, I'll go.

05:29.846 --> 05:33.349
You guys catch up.

05:33.517 --> 05:35.017
Thanks, babe.

05:37.187 --> 05:38.854
He's a great guy.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.690
So, what are you
working on now?

05:41.858 --> 05:43.275
Raptors, mostly.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.611
My favorite.

05:45.695 --> 05:47.947
Do you remember
the sounds they made?

05:49.116 --> 05:50.616
I try not to.

05:50.700 --> 05:53.494
All our theories
about raptor intelligence,

05:53.578 --> 05:56.413
what they were capable of,
we weren't even close.

05:56.498 --> 05:57.623
Tell me.

05:57.707 --> 05:59.458
We did cranial scans
of a fossil skull

05:59.543 --> 06:02.795
and found what looks to be a very
sophisticated resonating chamber.

06:02.879 --> 06:04.964
Wait a second.
So we were right.

06:05.048 --> 06:06.549
They'd the ability
to vocalize.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.634
It's the key to
their social intelligence.

06:08.718 --> 06:10.886
Which explains why they
could work as a team.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.721
They'd coordinate
attacks so their prey

06:12.806 --> 06:14.473
wouldn't know
what was going on.

06:14.558 --> 06:15.975
They could
talk to each other.

06:16.059 --> 06:18.185
To a degree
we never imagined.

06:18.395 --> 06:20.813
Ellie, they were smart.

06:20.897 --> 06:23.732
They were smarter
than dolphins or whales.

06:24.401 --> 06:26.819
They were
smarter than primates.

06:32.409 --> 06:36.745
I just wanted to say, if you ever need
help, sometimes you forget to ask.

06:37.831 --> 06:41.208
So you can call me.
Anything, anytime.

06:41.918 --> 06:43.335
Sure.

06:47.716 --> 06:49.425
You're still the best.

06:50.260 --> 06:51.677
I mean that.

06:53.096 --> 06:54.930
The last of my breed.

07:03.106 --> 07:07.651
It is through the study of the
anterior chamber in multiple specimens

07:07.736 --> 07:09.862
that we can
determine the correlation

07:09.946 --> 07:12.364
between the upper
palate and the larynx.

07:12.449 --> 07:15.576
This lets us theorize,
theorize, mind you,

07:15.660 --> 07:19.830
that the raptor was capable of
sophisticated vocalizations

07:19.915 --> 07:23.083
which would have been a tremendous
evolutionary advantage.

07:23.168 --> 07:27.630
Raptors were fierce, intelligent
and socially sophisticated.

07:27.756 --> 07:31.467
They were able to hunt in numbers
and coordinate their efforts.

07:32.636 --> 07:35.679
Were it not for the cataclysmic
events which overtook them,

07:35.764 --> 07:39.016
it's entirely possible that
raptors, rather than humans,

07:39.100 --> 07:42.561
would have become the dominant
species on this planet.

07:43.021 --> 07:45.231
I hope this has
been of interest.

07:45.315 --> 07:48.484
It certainly excites
us as paleontologists.

07:49.110 --> 07:51.570
There is much
more to discover.

07:51.655 --> 07:56.116
That is why we continue to need,
and ask for, your support.

08:00.789 --> 08:02.164
Thank you.

08:12.008 --> 08:14.218
Thank you very much,
Dr. Grant.

08:14.386 --> 08:16.845
Now, does anyone
have a question?

08:19.683 --> 08:20.766
Fine.

08:20.850 --> 08:24.228
Does anyone have a question that
does not relate to Jurassic Park?

08:26.481 --> 08:29.191
Or the incident
in San Diego

08:29.567 --> 08:31.860
which I did not witness?

08:34.530 --> 08:35.698
Yes, sir?

08:36.533 --> 08:38.784
Your theory on raptors
is good and all,

08:38.909 --> 08:41.160
but isn't all this
conjecture kind of moot?

08:41.246 --> 08:45.624
Once the U.N. and Costa Rica and everyone
decide how to handle that second island,

08:45.709 --> 08:48.502
scientists will just go in
and look for themselves.

08:48.586 --> 08:52.172
Dinosaurs lived
65 million years ago.

08:52.257 --> 08:56.427
What is left of them is
fossilized in the rocks.

08:56.511 --> 09:00.973
And it is in the rock that real
scientists make real discoveries.

09:01.057 --> 09:04.560
What John Hammond and
InGen did at Jurassic Park

09:04.853 --> 09:08.480
is create genetically
engineered theme-park monsters.

09:08.565 --> 09:11.150
Nothing more
and nothing less.

09:11.234 --> 09:14.486
Are you saying you wouldn't
want to get onto Isla Sorna

09:14.571 --> 09:17.114
and study them if
you had the chance?

09:17.198 --> 09:21.702
No force on Earth or Heaven
could get me on that island.

09:33.965 --> 09:35.883
What we got here, Nashy?

09:35.967 --> 09:38.802
Einhorn 20-millimeter,
gas-operated semi-automatic.

09:38.928 --> 09:42.848
10-shot, magazine fed, rotating
bolt recoil-reducing muzzle brake.

09:42.932 --> 09:44.600
High explosive...

09:52.150 --> 09:53.484
Udesky.

09:53.568 --> 09:55.652
- It's Paul Kirby.
- Just checking...

09:55.737 --> 09:58.822
Yes, sir.
We're good to go here.

09:59.574 --> 10:01.116
Matter of fact,
I can lock things down

10:01.201 --> 10:03.410
just as soon as you
drop me that payment.

10:06.623 --> 10:11.293
Well, that's right, two of the very
best men I could possibly find.

10:13.296 --> 10:15.547
No, sir, I haven't worked
with them personally,

10:15.632 --> 10:19.802
but believe me, sir, both of these
men come very highly recommended.

10:28.019 --> 10:29.269
Are you all right?

10:29.354 --> 10:30.979
Nothing to worry
about, sir.

10:31.481 --> 10:33.649
It's gonna be
a walk in the park.

10:42.867 --> 10:45.494
Billy, I don't think
I'm doing this right.

10:53.962 --> 10:56.046
Let's try the toothbrush.

10:58.341 --> 11:00.050
You've got to go slowly.

11:01.678 --> 11:03.762
Just take
a little bit at a time.

11:03.847 --> 11:06.849
I can never tell what's
rock and what's bone.

11:07.225 --> 11:08.892
Technically,
it's all rock.

11:09.018 --> 11:12.312
The calcium in the bones is
replaced during fossilization.

11:12.814 --> 11:15.190
But you can feel
the difference. See?

11:15.859 --> 11:17.359
Rough,

11:18.194 --> 11:19.570
smooth.

11:20.363 --> 11:22.197
Rough, smooth.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.747
Dr. Grant.

11:31.708 --> 11:32.875
Mr. Brennan.

11:33.501 --> 11:35.294
So, how did it go?

11:35.837 --> 11:39.339
Well, it's not too late to
change your major, Billy.

11:39.883 --> 11:41.717
That good, huh?
Worse.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.385
We'll have to
pack up in four weeks.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.845
Three.

11:45.096 --> 11:47.055
I had to rent
some equipment.

11:47.223 --> 11:49.308
Come here.
I got to show you something.

11:49.392 --> 11:50.893
You like
computers, right?

11:51.060 --> 11:52.561
I like the abacus, Billy.

11:53.188 --> 11:55.355
Meet the future
of paleontology.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.733
It's a rapid prototyper.

11:58.401 --> 12:00.861
I enter in the scanned data
from the raptor skull.

12:00.945 --> 12:03.614
The computer breaks it down
into thousands of slices.

12:03.698 --> 12:07.576
And this thing sculpts it,
one layer at a time.

12:08.912 --> 12:10.078
It's done.

12:19.923 --> 12:23.091
I give you the resonating
chamber of a Velociraptor.

12:23.801 --> 12:25.302
Listen to this.

12:36.773 --> 12:38.148
Wow.

12:38.816 --> 12:41.109
This is brilliant, Billy.
Really, it is.

12:41.569 --> 12:43.779
Sad to say, it's just
a little bit late.

12:43.905 --> 12:47.783
Dr. Grant? Paul Kirby,
Kirby Enterprises.

12:48.576 --> 12:50.911
My card.
How you doing, Billy?

12:53.122 --> 12:54.957
What can I do for you,
Mr. Kirby?

12:56.668 --> 12:59.169
First thing,
I'm a great admirer of yours.

12:59.254 --> 13:02.339
And I have a proposition
I'd like to discuss with you.

13:02.423 --> 13:04.883
Would you have dinner with
my wife and me this evening?

13:04.968 --> 13:06.218
It'll be our treat.

13:06.302 --> 13:07.678
That'd be great but

13:07.929 --> 13:10.973
I'm tired, I've been traveling.
Maybe some other time.

13:11.099 --> 13:13.517
Believe me, this will
be worth your while.

13:13.601 --> 13:14.685
We'd love to.

13:14.769 --> 13:17.187
Oh, terrific!
That's the spirit. Good.

13:17.272 --> 13:18.814
This evening then.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.533
Billy,
thank you for coming.

13:29.617 --> 13:30.742
Dr. Grant,
how are you?

13:30.827 --> 13:33.787
Amanda, this is
Billy and Dr. Grant.

13:33.871 --> 13:35.080
Mrs. Kirby,
how are you?

13:35.164 --> 13:36.665
What are you
boys drinking?

13:38.251 --> 13:40.669
Ice Pick, Catfish.
Two, please, Cat.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.005
We've admired
your work for years.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.840
Really.
Truly inspiring.

13:44.924 --> 13:47.217
Amanda and I just
love the outdoors.

13:47.302 --> 13:50.512
We've been on nearly every adventure
tour they can come up with:

13:50.597 --> 13:53.765
The Nile, Galápagos, K2.

13:53.850 --> 13:57.603
We even have two seats reserved on the
first commercial flight to the moon.

13:57.687 --> 14:00.022
For our wedding
anniversary this year,

14:00.106 --> 14:02.065
we wanted to do
something really special.

14:02.150 --> 14:04.568
Something...
Once in a lifetime.

14:04.861 --> 14:08.155
I've chartered an airplane
to fly us over Isla Sorna.

14:08.406 --> 14:10.574
And we'd like you
to be our guide.

14:12.243 --> 14:14.244
There you go, guys.

14:16.205 --> 14:19.833
That's a very kind offer, Mr.
Kirby, but I'm a very, very busy man.

14:19.917 --> 14:23.170
I can recommend a couple of guys
who are really highly qualified...

14:23.254 --> 14:26.131
No, no.
You're the best.

14:26.382 --> 14:27.841
You've seen these
animals in the flesh.

14:27.925 --> 14:29.926
There's no one
who comes close to you.

14:30.553 --> 14:34.348
You wouldn't be able to fly low enough
to see anything of any real interest.

14:34.432 --> 14:36.683
See, that's the
interesting part,

14:36.768 --> 14:39.144
because we have
permission to fly low.

14:39.228 --> 14:40.395
How low?

14:41.022 --> 14:44.858
I'm no aviation expert, but a heck
of a lot lower than anybody else.

14:44.942 --> 14:46.485
From what I understand,

14:46.569 --> 14:48.737
it's pretty much
whatever we want.

14:49.739 --> 14:51.114
That's hard to believe.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.158
Through my
business dealings,

14:53.242 --> 14:55.118
import-export,
emerging markets,

14:55.203 --> 14:57.287
I've made a lot of
friends in high places.

14:57.372 --> 15:00.123
In this case,
the Costa Rican government.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.751
Dr. Grant,
you have no idea

15:02.835 --> 15:05.379
how important it is
that you come along.

15:05.463 --> 15:06.755
It would make
all the difference.

15:06.839 --> 15:07.881
Mrs. Kirby, I...

15:07.965 --> 15:09.675
And, of course,
we'd love to make

15:09.759 --> 15:11.760
a contribution to
your research here.

15:12.637 --> 15:13.804
So,

15:15.640 --> 15:19.101
I could write all kinds of numbers
on this check, Dr. Grant.

15:19.811 --> 15:20.936
Tell me,

15:23.272 --> 15:25.357
what's it gonna take?

15:39.622 --> 15:42.499
Even with what I pay you,
couldn't you afford a better bag?

15:42.583 --> 15:43.792
No way.

15:44.293 --> 15:45.794
This one's lucky.

15:46.379 --> 15:50.006
Couple of years ago, some
buddies and I went hang gliding

15:50.091 --> 15:52.092
off these cliffs
in New Zealand.

15:52.176 --> 15:57.097
And this big updraft came and swept
me right against the side. Wham!

15:57.181 --> 15:59.224
That does sound lucky.

15:59.308 --> 16:02.436
It was this strap alone
that saved my life.

16:02.979 --> 16:04.980
Got hooked on a rock
as I was falling.

16:05.064 --> 16:08.817
Reverse Darwinism.
Survival of the most idiotic.

16:11.154 --> 16:14.823
Alan, I want to thank you
for bringing me along.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.992
The bones will still
be there when we get back.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.578
That's the great thing about bones.
They never run away.

16:20.747 --> 16:24.458
And truth is,
you got me into this.

16:25.877 --> 16:29.504
And I have no intention of being
on my own with these people.

16:32.925 --> 16:34.426
Don't get too excited.

16:34.510 --> 16:36.344
Chances are,
we won't see a thing.

16:37.638 --> 16:39.014
Your turn to be nice.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.099
Wake me when we get there.

16:48.733 --> 16:50.859
So how do you
know the Kirbys?

16:51.903 --> 16:53.695
Through our church.

17:13.758 --> 17:14.800
Alan.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.885
- Alan!

17:18.137 --> 17:20.387
Wake up.
We're almost there.

17:34.403 --> 17:38.490
Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla
Sorna, this is San Juan Approach.

17:38.574 --> 17:40.742
You're flying in
restricted airspace.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.036
Immediately turn
to coordinates two...

18:33.379 --> 18:35.297
My God,
I had forgotten.

18:47.977 --> 18:50.228
We did it, honey.
We're here.

18:50.980 --> 18:53.899
Cooper!
If you see anything, yell up!

18:53.983 --> 18:55.734
No, I thought
I'd keep it to myself.

18:55.818 --> 18:58.862
I'm sorry. Everyone, if you
look out the left of the plane,

18:58.988 --> 19:01.656
you can see a whole
herd of Brachiosaurus.

19:01.741 --> 19:05.285
In fact, you can see at the front of the
group the alpha male grazing there.

19:05.369 --> 19:08.413
Udesky? Nash? How about up front?
You guys see anything?

19:08.497 --> 19:09.915
Nothing yet, Mr. Kirby.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.919
Mrs. Kirby, look!
Out here, you'll see a group of...

19:14.003 --> 19:17.172
Mr. Kirby, we have a landing strip.
You want me to put her down?

19:17.256 --> 19:20.425
No! I told you, I want to circle
first, see the whole island.

19:20.509 --> 19:22.302
What do you mean?
You can't land!

19:22.386 --> 19:24.429
Hold on.
I can explain...

19:24.513 --> 19:26.514
You cannot land on
this island!

19:26.599 --> 19:28.850
It will be fine.
Don't worry, please.

19:29.352 --> 19:31.061
- Are you crazy?
- Sit down!

19:32.104 --> 19:34.356
Will you please sit down?

19:44.075 --> 19:47.619
Billy, tell me
we didn't land.

19:48.371 --> 19:50.038
Eric!

19:52.208 --> 19:53.333
Ben!

19:53.417 --> 19:55.710
I think they're
looking for someone.

19:57.588 --> 19:58.880
Ben!

20:06.389 --> 20:08.723
Dr. Grant,
are you all right?

20:08.808 --> 20:10.225
I'm sorry
we had to be so rough.

20:10.309 --> 20:11.893
Who hit me?

20:12.228 --> 20:14.229
That would be Cooper.

20:14.897 --> 20:16.106
What are they doing?

20:16.232 --> 20:18.483
Setting up a perimeter
to make the place safe.

20:18.567 --> 20:21.653
Trust me, on this island,
there's no such thing as safe!

20:21.737 --> 20:23.613
We have to get
back on that plane!

20:23.739 --> 20:27.617
Tell your wife to stop making that noise!
That is a very, very bad idea!

20:27.702 --> 20:29.995
Amanda!
Ben!

20:30.079 --> 20:33.540
Honey, Dr. Grant
said that's a bad idea.

20:33.916 --> 20:35.041
What?

20:35.126 --> 20:37.836
He says
it's a bad idea!

20:38.337 --> 20:40.171
What's a bad idea?

20:42.258 --> 20:43.800
What was that?

20:44.635 --> 20:46.261
That's a Tyrannosaurus.

20:46.345 --> 20:49.264
I don't think so.
It sounds bigger.

20:52.893 --> 20:55.770
We have to leave!
We have to leave now!

20:56.397 --> 20:58.273
- Get on the plane!
- What's going on?

20:58.941 --> 21:00.775
Get on the plane!

21:04.488 --> 21:05.613
What about the other guy?

21:05.698 --> 21:07.032
Cooper's a professional.

21:07.116 --> 21:08.742
He can handle himself.

21:08.826 --> 21:11.244
Get on the plane! Hurry!

21:11.579 --> 21:12.871
It's all right.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.634
Paul, we can't...
It's all right.

21:26.719 --> 21:27.886
We'll circle the island.

21:28.179 --> 21:29.763
Give me a hand, Udesky!

21:48.616 --> 21:50.450
Stop!
What are you doing?

21:50.785 --> 21:51.910
That's Cooper!

21:53.287 --> 21:54.704
Stop.

21:54.789 --> 21:56.623
Come on,
get out of the way!

21:57.541 --> 21:59.167
You know
I can't stop this plane.

22:01.670 --> 22:02.962
Oh, my God!

22:04.840 --> 22:07.008
- Fuel cut-off!
- We're going down!

22:32.993 --> 22:34.327
You okay?

22:35.121 --> 22:37.038
We're okay up here.

22:37.456 --> 22:39.499
Everyone, just stay put.

22:39.917 --> 22:42.085
San Juan Approach.
Mayday, mayday!

22:42.169 --> 22:43.878
Who has the
satellite phone?

22:44.421 --> 22:46.756
I do. I got it right here.

22:46.841 --> 22:49.509
I'm not getting anything.
The radio's gone.

22:58.185 --> 22:59.727
We haven't landed yet.

23:03.023 --> 23:05.859
- All circuits are busy.
- Damn it! Oh, man.

23:08.279 --> 23:09.362
What was that?

23:12.199 --> 23:13.950
- Keep still!
- Keep still!

23:14.034 --> 23:16.327
Relax. What is it? What?

23:18.414 --> 23:20.456
- What is it?
- Hold it!

23:22.293 --> 23:23.751
Hang on, everyone!

23:44.190 --> 23:45.648
Help me!

24:46.335 --> 24:48.002
Mrs. Kirby,
come back!

24:48.379 --> 24:49.796
No!

24:50.547 --> 24:51.589
Amanda!

25:37.594 --> 25:39.304
Follow me! This way!

25:47.855 --> 25:49.147
In here!

26:24.016 --> 26:25.600
I think we lost him.

26:30.647 --> 26:32.273
It's okay, it's dead.

26:34.485 --> 26:36.944
Nobody move a muscle.

27:37.548 --> 27:40.133
No, no!
Please, don't!

27:40.217 --> 27:41.968
Stop, please.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.888
It's time you did some
explaining, Mr. Kirby.

27:46.640 --> 27:49.225
We called everyone.
We did everything we could.

27:49.309 --> 27:50.435
No one would help us.

27:50.519 --> 27:53.104
The Costa Rican government
said this is a no-fly zone.

27:53.188 --> 27:56.607
The U.S. Embassy,
that's our U.S. Embassy,

27:56.692 --> 27:59.819
told us we should accept the inevitable.
Can you believe that?

27:59.903 --> 28:01.904
You let a 12-year-old
go parasailing alone?

28:01.989 --> 28:02.989
No!

28:03.073 --> 28:04.782
He wasn't alone.
He was with a friend.

28:04.867 --> 28:06.659
Ben Hildebrand.

28:06.743 --> 28:09.078
Paul and I divorced
over a year ago.

28:09.413 --> 28:10.872
All right, why me?

28:11.165 --> 28:13.583
He said we needed someone who'd
been on the island before.

28:13.667 --> 28:16.836
Yes, but I did not tell
you to kidnap somebody.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.881
I have never
been on this island.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.341
Sure you have.
You wrote that book.

28:22.426 --> 28:26.888
That was Isla Nublar.
This is Isla Sorna, Site B.

28:26.972 --> 28:29.056
You mean there are two
islands with dinosaurs?

28:29.141 --> 28:30.475
Stay out of this.

28:30.559 --> 28:32.101
How long have
they been missing?

28:32.436 --> 28:33.478
Eight weeks.

28:33.562 --> 28:35.146
Almost eight weeks now.

28:37.441 --> 28:40.776
Billy. We'll go back to the
plane, salvage what we can.

28:40.861 --> 28:42.153
Then we make for the coast.

28:42.237 --> 28:45.823
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving
this island without our son.

28:46.283 --> 28:48.367
Then you can go
and look for him.

28:48.452 --> 28:51.287
Or you can stick with us, as
long as you don't hold us up.

28:51.371 --> 28:52.622
Either way,

28:53.415 --> 28:56.083
you probably won't
get off this island alive.

29:07.763 --> 29:09.847
So? What do we do?

29:11.058 --> 29:13.017
We search for your son

29:14.853 --> 29:17.271
in the direction
that they're going.

29:18.732 --> 29:20.024
Excellent.

29:45.801 --> 29:47.134
Sorry.

29:48.053 --> 29:50.680
It's nothing you
haven't seen before, Paul.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.934
How much weight
did you say you lost?

29:55.018 --> 29:57.937
About 25 pounds.
I've been swimming.

29:58.480 --> 30:01.983
Swimming? You hate to swim.
You don't even know how to swim.

30:02.067 --> 30:03.901
I know. I learned.

30:04.861 --> 30:05.987
You look good.

30:06.113 --> 30:07.196
So do you.

30:11.493 --> 30:13.119
How would you
classify it, Billy?

30:13.203 --> 30:14.495
Well...

30:15.122 --> 30:17.248
it's a super-predator.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.085
A Suchomimus.

30:21.670 --> 30:24.005
That snout.
No, think bigger.

30:24.256 --> 30:26.591
Baryonyx?
Not with that sail.

30:28.176 --> 30:30.303
Spinosaurus aegypticus.

30:33.390 --> 30:35.600
I don't remember
that on InGen's list.

30:35.684 --> 30:37.059
Because it wasn't
on their list.

30:37.144 --> 30:40.062
And it makes you wonder
what else they were up to.

30:51.950 --> 30:53.701
So, Mr. Kirby, tell me.

30:53.785 --> 30:58.331
When you climbed K2, did you base
camp at 25,000 or 30,000 feet?

31:00.250 --> 31:03.002
30,000 feet. We were
pretty close to the top.

31:03.086 --> 31:05.796
You were about 1,000
feet above it, actually.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.216
No, that's
a common mistake.

31:10.260 --> 31:13.721
There's no such thing as
Kirby Enterprises, is there?

31:15.223 --> 31:16.932
It's Kirby Paint and
Tile Plus.

31:17.351 --> 31:19.226
The "Plus" stands
for bathroom fixtures.

31:19.311 --> 31:22.146
We're in the Westgate Shopping
Center, Enid, Oklahoma...

31:22.230 --> 31:24.649
I don't suppose that check
you wrote us is any good.

31:24.733 --> 31:26.984
I will pay you
the money I owe you.

31:27.069 --> 31:28.653
This is good.

31:29.821 --> 31:33.199
Here we are, in the worst place in
the world, and we're not being paid!

31:33.617 --> 31:37.370
Wait, fellas. Hold on!
I'll make this up to you.

31:37.454 --> 31:40.373
If you ever do a
bathroom or a kitchen...

31:41.583 --> 31:43.334
You're not really
a mercenary, are you?

31:43.418 --> 31:44.835
I never said I was.

31:44.920 --> 31:47.171
That's true.
What are you?

31:47.964 --> 31:52.301
I'm like a booking agent.
One of the guys got sick and couldn't come.

31:52.886 --> 31:54.512
Excuse me. Here.

31:55.430 --> 31:58.265
So you run a hardware store?
Paint and tile, yeah.

31:58.934 --> 32:00.768
You never can tell
about people, can you?

32:00.852 --> 32:02.395
Ain't that the truth?

32:03.230 --> 32:05.064
Eric!
Quiet.

32:05.148 --> 32:06.440
Would you stop that?

32:06.525 --> 32:08.901
Dr. Grant says this is
very dangerous territory.

32:08.985 --> 32:12.446
Maybe we should split up.
We could cover twice as much.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.115
Dr. Grant says
that's a bad idea.

32:14.199 --> 32:15.700
Dr. Grant says this...

32:15.784 --> 32:18.494
Why hire an expert if we
don't use his advice?

32:18.578 --> 32:21.372
Except Dr. Grant
isn't looking for Eric.

32:21.456 --> 32:22.707
He's looking
for the coast.

32:22.791 --> 32:24.041
Go ahead and scream.

32:24.126 --> 32:27.253
When that "Tricycloplots" attacks
you, don't come crying to me.

32:27.337 --> 32:28.379
Don't worry about that.

32:28.463 --> 32:30.589
What? What did you say?

32:30.674 --> 32:32.216
What did you say?

32:32.300 --> 32:33.718
Never mind!
Paul, just drop it!

32:33.802 --> 32:36.971
If we split up, I'm
going with you guys.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.067
Eric!

32:50.527 --> 32:52.528
Mrs. Kirby!

32:54.197 --> 32:57.867
Mrs. Kirby, the chances are remote
they're still in the vicinity.

33:04.332 --> 33:05.708
Young adult.

33:07.878 --> 33:09.253
Hey, guys!

33:15.552 --> 33:17.344
That's my camera.

33:21.975 --> 33:23.309
The battery's dead.

33:23.393 --> 33:25.311
I've got an idea.

33:26.188 --> 33:27.855
Let me have the camera.

33:30.275 --> 33:32.943
Where were you
on that one, Ma?

33:34.029 --> 33:36.322
Okay, dive. Dive.

33:38.825 --> 33:40.075
Come on, Ma.

33:40.160 --> 33:41.202
Eric.

33:41.286 --> 33:42.787
Ma, you were
supposed to catch it!

33:43.205 --> 33:45.915
I shot this the morning
they disappeared.

33:45.999 --> 33:48.918
No, I want that.
Let me take that.

33:49.002 --> 33:51.212
Come on, give me that.
Come on, baby.

33:51.338 --> 33:55.132
- See anything yet?
- No, not yet!

33:56.218 --> 33:57.760
What was that?

33:59.429 --> 34:02.848
Unclip us.
There's a big clip!

34:02.933 --> 34:04.558
I can't see.
I can't do it!

34:07.270 --> 34:09.146
I'm going to unhook you,
all right?

34:09.231 --> 34:12.024
One, two, three!

34:13.360 --> 34:16.612
Are you okay, buddy?
I'm gonna drop myself down now.

34:17.697 --> 34:19.281
The camera's still on.

34:22.369 --> 34:25.161
He's alive.
I know he's alive.

34:25.455 --> 34:27.039
We're gonna find him.

34:29.708 --> 34:31.752
Can you fly
one of those?

34:31.920 --> 34:33.462
Maybe.

34:33.547 --> 34:35.630
As long as the sail is not torn.

34:35.715 --> 34:37.382
Well, let's take it.

34:37.967 --> 34:40.761
If we spot a plane, it might be
a good way to get attention.

34:41.054 --> 34:42.554
Pull it over this way.

34:51.982 --> 34:54.733
I got it, hold on!
Okay. Okay.

34:54.818 --> 34:56.318
Oh, my God!

35:02.909 --> 35:05.244
Okay, you're free.

35:07.789 --> 35:09.832
Get her back, Mr. Kirby!

35:09.916 --> 35:11.500
Amanda!

35:12.043 --> 35:13.127
Wait!

35:24.264 --> 35:25.681
Amanda!

35:34.190 --> 35:36.233
Amanda, stop.

35:37.402 --> 35:40.571
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about Ben.

35:43.742 --> 35:46.035
It's not Ben, Paul.

35:47.203 --> 35:50.289
It's Eric. He's out
there all by himself.

35:51.625 --> 35:53.459
I know, I know.

35:53.543 --> 35:56.795
Our baby is out
here all by himself.

35:57.088 --> 35:59.465
Listen to me.
We'll find him.

36:00.175 --> 36:01.342
I promise.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.184
Paul.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.689
Dr. Grant!

36:16.650 --> 36:18.734
You should
come look at this!

36:49.933 --> 36:51.266
Raptor.

37:03.571 --> 37:05.155
We're going
to find him.

37:05.240 --> 37:07.783
Are you listening to me?
We're going to find him.

37:07.867 --> 37:09.618
Kid's got resources.

37:09.703 --> 37:12.121
Remember what it was like
to try to ground him?

37:14.582 --> 37:15.749
Where's Billy?

37:22.257 --> 37:24.049
What are you doing?

37:24.217 --> 37:25.884
I was photographing
the nest.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.053
Don't do that again.

37:28.930 --> 37:30.180
I'm sorry.

37:31.433 --> 37:34.435
If I lose you, it's just
me and the damn tourists.

37:43.278 --> 37:44.903
I bet you
Eric is in there.

37:44.988 --> 37:47.531
Don't you think?
I'd bet my bottom dollar!

37:49.325 --> 37:50.993
What do you think it is?

37:51.077 --> 37:54.455
As far as I'm concerned,
it's the Four Seasons.

38:30.950 --> 38:32.201
Eric!

38:32.285 --> 38:33.660
Paul! Don't.

38:43.171 --> 38:44.963
What the hell.

39:00.897 --> 39:03.816
Who's got some change?
It only takes quarters.

39:03.900 --> 39:06.360
I've got $1 . 10.

40:01.958 --> 40:04.042
This is how you
make dinosaurs?

40:04.377 --> 40:05.627
No.

40:06.671 --> 40:08.797
This is how you play God.

41:04.604 --> 41:06.063
This way!

41:11.236 --> 41:12.569
It's locked!

41:16.324 --> 41:17.824
This way, this way!
Go! Go!

41:31.923 --> 41:34.007
Hey, over here!

41:44.394 --> 41:46.061
Push, push!

41:55.697 --> 41:57.072
My God.

41:58.449 --> 42:00.200
He's calling for help.

42:00.702 --> 42:02.160
Come on!

42:25.226 --> 42:26.852
Into the herd!

42:54.922 --> 42:56.465
Head for the trees!

43:24.410 --> 43:25.619
Udesky.

43:44.806 --> 43:46.181
Mr. Kirby!

43:47.850 --> 43:48.934
Billy?

43:49.018 --> 43:50.060
Is Alan with you?

43:57.610 --> 43:59.277
Oh, my God.

43:59.362 --> 44:00.987
Mr. Udesky!

44:04.283 --> 44:05.492
He's dead.

44:07.412 --> 44:08.954
Oh, my God.
No, he's not.

44:09.038 --> 44:10.747
No, wait.
Something's not right.

44:10.832 --> 44:11.998
We've got to help him.

44:12.708 --> 44:13.917
Amanda!

44:19.465 --> 44:20.549
Hold on!

44:28.349 --> 44:29.683
They set a trap.

44:30.518 --> 44:32.310
They actually set a trap.

44:38.067 --> 44:39.568
What are you saying?

44:40.445 --> 44:42.112
What are you looking for?

45:54.268 --> 45:55.477
Wait!

46:11.619 --> 46:12.786
Thanks.

46:13.412 --> 46:14.913
Thanks a lot, Eric.

46:18.376 --> 46:20.752
You know who I am?
Yeah.

46:21.712 --> 46:24.464
Your parents are here.
They're looking for you.

46:25.299 --> 46:26.383
Together?

46:26.926 --> 46:28.009
Together.

46:30.012 --> 46:31.388
That's not good.

46:31.514 --> 46:33.515
They don't do
so well together.

46:33.891 --> 46:37.852
You'd be surprised what people
can do when they have to.

46:53.661 --> 46:54.953
You're Alan Grant.

46:56.539 --> 46:58.248
What are you doing here?

47:00.376 --> 47:01.710
Your parents

47:03.337 --> 47:04.879
invited me along.

47:28.571 --> 47:30.322
I read both
of your books.

47:31.782 --> 47:33.617
I liked
the first one more.

47:33.909 --> 47:35.910
Before you were on
the island.

47:36.746 --> 47:38.747
You liked dinosaurs
back then.

47:39.373 --> 47:41.958
Back then, they hadn't
tried to eat me yet.

47:45.504 --> 47:48.173
When InGen cleared out, they
left a lot of stuff behind.

47:48.257 --> 47:49.341
Any weapons?

47:49.425 --> 47:52.302
No, and I just used the
last of the gas grenades.

47:52.678 --> 47:54.095
And I appreciate that.

47:57.933 --> 48:00.185
Be careful with that.
T-Rex.

48:00.978 --> 48:02.562
It scares the
smaller ones away

48:02.647 --> 48:05.065
but it attracts one really
big one with a fin.

48:05.816 --> 48:07.692
This is T-Rex pee?

48:11.238 --> 48:12.656
How did you get it?

48:12.740 --> 48:14.449
You don't want to know.

48:20.039 --> 48:21.831
Dessert?
Sure.

48:26.879 --> 48:27.962
I have to tell you,

48:28.047 --> 48:31.174
I'm astonished you've lasted
eight weeks on this island.

48:33.135 --> 48:34.761
Is that all it's been?

48:36.055 --> 48:38.682
You're alive and
that's the important thing.

48:39.141 --> 48:42.060
Thanks to you, that's one
thing we have in common.

48:44.772 --> 48:46.648
Did you read
Malcolm's book?

48:47.692 --> 48:48.900
Yeah.

48:50.319 --> 48:51.403
So?

48:51.779 --> 48:53.488
I don't know.
I mean...

48:53.948 --> 48:55.657
It was kind of preachy.

48:56.325 --> 48:58.785
And too much chaos.
Everything is chaos.

48:59.203 --> 49:01.621
Seemed like he
was high on himself.

49:03.833 --> 49:06.668
That's two things
that we have in common.

49:13.134 --> 49:14.300
Listen.

49:15.010 --> 49:16.219
Compys!

49:41.245 --> 49:42.495
Alan!

49:58.429 --> 50:01.848
No matter how this turns
out it wasn't your fault.

50:03.184 --> 50:05.518
Eric's always been
a strong-willed kid.

50:05.644 --> 50:06.936
Always.

50:07.021 --> 50:11.107
Then you throw someone like Ben
Hildebrand into the mix, and...

50:12.359 --> 50:13.485
well.

50:14.487 --> 50:15.653
Well, what?

50:16.614 --> 50:19.032
All I'm saying is,
it's not your fault.

50:23.537 --> 50:24.621
No.

50:24.705 --> 50:27.499
If he'd been with you,
he'd be completely safe.

50:28.459 --> 50:31.377
You drive five miles
under the speed limit.

50:32.797 --> 50:35.381
And I've totaled
three cars in three years.

50:36.300 --> 50:39.844
Well, not three. The Buick
wasn't really totaled.

50:41.347 --> 50:44.390
I just said it was, because
I wanted to get the S. U.V.

50:49.355 --> 50:51.731
I am so sorry that
you have to be here.

50:55.027 --> 50:56.069
I'm not.

52:13.230 --> 52:16.149
There's a boat,
right alongside the bank.

52:16.317 --> 52:17.400
Looks in good shape.

52:17.526 --> 52:18.610
Rescue boat?

52:18.986 --> 52:20.320
No, no.

52:21.155 --> 52:22.989
Just something left behind.

52:23.282 --> 52:24.490
But it floats.

52:36.462 --> 52:38.004
We stick to the plan.

52:38.839 --> 52:40.256
Head for the coast.

52:40.341 --> 52:42.175
You're not gonna
look for Dr. Grant?

52:42.301 --> 52:43.968
The coast
was Alan's idea.

52:44.053 --> 52:45.762
If he's alive,
that's where he's headed.

52:45.846 --> 52:46.888
I agree.

52:47.014 --> 52:48.348
What about Eric?

52:48.974 --> 52:50.391
Eric's a smart kid.

52:50.517 --> 52:53.019
He probably knows his best
chance is by the coast.

52:53.145 --> 52:56.147
He figures the big dinosaurs are
in the center of the island.

52:56.231 --> 52:57.482
Right?

52:59.026 --> 53:00.193
Sure.

53:06.992 --> 53:08.868
You know what this is?

53:09.203 --> 53:11.245
It's a raptor claw.
I used to have one.

53:11.997 --> 53:13.039
A fossil.

53:14.541 --> 53:15.750
Mine is new.

53:17.378 --> 53:19.754
How much of the island
did you explore?

53:20.255 --> 53:22.340
I stayed pretty close
to the compound.

53:22.424 --> 53:24.258
I figured if anyone
came looking for me,

53:24.343 --> 53:26.052
that's where they'd start.

53:26.929 --> 53:29.180
We need to get to the coast.
That was the plan.

53:29.264 --> 53:30.390
Are you sure?

53:30.516 --> 53:33.184
The closer you get to water,
the bigger things get.

53:33.268 --> 53:35.853
If we can find our way
down into the canyon

53:35.938 --> 53:38.606
we can follow that
river out to the coast.

53:39.400 --> 53:41.234
After we find your parents.

53:41.777 --> 53:42.902
Then what?

53:43.570 --> 53:45.446
One step at a time.
Listen.

53:47.199 --> 53:49.283
What?

53:49.451 --> 53:51.577
That's my dad's
satellite phone!

53:55.207 --> 53:56.708
Wait a minute.
How do you know?

53:57.626 --> 54:00.503
"Kirby Paint and
Tile Plus, in Westgate!"

54:01.255 --> 54:02.630
Dad!

54:17.604 --> 54:18.771
Mum!

54:22.359 --> 54:25.194
Mum! Dad!

54:26.071 --> 54:28.990
Eric! This way!

54:31.744 --> 54:33.911
Mum! Dad!

54:41.420 --> 54:43.838
Mum, Dad!
Mum, Dad!

54:50.846 --> 54:52.972
I knew it. My God.

54:53.932 --> 54:55.016
I knew it.

54:56.101 --> 54:58.811
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

54:59.146 --> 55:00.938
Boy,
am I glad to see you.

55:01.398 --> 55:02.982
Hey, you got my bag.

55:03.192 --> 55:05.985
Yeah. Lucky strap.

55:07.321 --> 55:08.863
Want me to carry it?

55:10.491 --> 55:12.325
We need to
find a gap here.

55:14.203 --> 55:16.662
How did you know we were here?
The phone.

55:16.747 --> 55:18.956
That stupid jingle from the store.
I heard it.

55:19.041 --> 55:21.167
My phone?
Your satellite phone.

55:21.251 --> 55:22.835
Where is it?
I don't have it.

55:22.920 --> 55:24.629
When did you use it last?

55:25.172 --> 55:26.923
On the plane.

55:27.007 --> 55:29.175
I got a call
on the plane and...

55:30.177 --> 55:33.429
What?
I loaned it to Nash.

55:34.264 --> 55:36.099
He must have had it
when he...

55:46.777 --> 55:47.944
Run.

56:52.342 --> 56:54.760
Alan, you want to
give me the bag back?

56:55.262 --> 56:56.762
It's okay, I got it.

56:57.598 --> 56:59.307
Please, give me the bag.

57:03.437 --> 57:04.645
It's not safe.

57:16.366 --> 57:17.575
Raptor eggs.

57:19.620 --> 57:22.455
Did you steal raptor eggs?

57:29.379 --> 57:31.130
Now it all makes sense.

57:31.340 --> 57:34.800
I swear, if I'd known you were
going to end up with them...

57:37.054 --> 57:38.179
It was an impulse,

57:38.263 --> 57:39.555
I thought they'd
be worth a fortune.

57:39.640 --> 57:42.725
Enough to fund the dig site
another 10 more years.

57:42.809 --> 57:45.686
You have to believe me.
This was a stupid decision,

57:45.771 --> 57:47.897
but I did it with
the best intentions.

57:47.981 --> 57:50.107
"With the best intentions."

57:51.860 --> 57:54.612
Some of the worst
things imaginable

57:54.696 --> 57:57.073
have been done with
the best intentions.

57:58.158 --> 57:59.700
You know what, Billy?

58:00.077 --> 58:04.830
As far as I'm concerned, you're no better
than the people that built this place.

58:22.140 --> 58:23.140
What are you doing?

58:23.225 --> 58:25.393
Those things are after us
because of those.

58:25.477 --> 58:29.021
Those things know
we have the eggs.

58:29.398 --> 58:33.484
If I drop them in the river,
they'll still be after us.

58:34.152 --> 58:35.945
What if they catch us
with them?

58:36.029 --> 58:37.947
What if they catch us
without them?

58:41.952 --> 58:44.245
There's a boat at the bottom,
just downriver.

58:44.329 --> 58:47.039
We can try and make it
to the coast, at least.

59:42.763 --> 59:44.263
You okay?
Yeah.

59:55.817 --> 59:58.194
Let's do this one
at a time, shall we?

01:00:36.691 --> 01:00:38.275
Okay, come on over!

01:00:39.236 --> 01:00:40.653
One at a time!

01:00:40.862 --> 01:00:42.238
All right, Eric.

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:44.448
I'm going to leave
you just for a minute.

01:00:44.533 --> 01:00:46.659
And then you'll be
right behind me, okay?

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:47.868
Mum!

01:00:48.412 --> 01:00:50.955
I've been alone in a water
truck for eight weeks.

01:00:51.039 --> 01:00:54.166
I think I can manage the next
two minutes without you.

01:00:57.379 --> 01:00:59.380
Right, we're
all together now.

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:26.949
Okay, Eric.

01:01:27.242 --> 01:01:28.701
- Okay.
- Come on, honey!

01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:29.994
Over you go.

01:02:03.904 --> 01:02:05.154
Mum?

01:02:07.616 --> 01:02:08.866
Oh, my God.

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:10.576
What is it?

01:02:11.203 --> 01:02:12.912
It's a birdcage.

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:14.705
For what?

01:02:21.254 --> 01:02:22.463
Dad!

01:02:22.547 --> 01:02:23.672
Eric!

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.316
I can't see him!

01:02:51.284 --> 01:02:52.368
No!

01:03:00.585 --> 01:03:01.752
This way!

01:03:17.644 --> 01:03:18.894
Billy, stop!

01:03:19.604 --> 01:03:22.106
Billy, stop!
Don't, Billy!

01:03:41.793 --> 01:03:43.335
Eric, hold on!

01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:49.675
Eric!

01:04:02.981 --> 01:04:04.023
Jump!

01:04:30.884 --> 01:04:32.051
Billy!

01:04:44.856 --> 01:04:46.023
Let go now!

01:05:32.195 --> 01:05:33.612
Eric!
He's there.

01:05:46.418 --> 01:05:49.044
There he is!
He's across the river!

01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:51.088
Get him out of here!

01:05:53.591 --> 01:05:55.259
No!
Go, Eric!

01:05:55.635 --> 01:05:57.094
What about Billy?

01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:13.360
Hang on, Billy!

01:06:21.953 --> 01:06:23.120
Wait.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.125
Get away!

01:07:53.378 --> 01:07:55.212
There's plenty of gasoline.

01:07:55.421 --> 01:07:58.298
Now we've just got to
make our way to the coast.

01:07:58.758 --> 01:08:01.260
Work out some
sort of a signal.

01:08:01.886 --> 01:08:05.430
Build a fire or something.
Something they can see from the air.

01:08:11.479 --> 01:08:12.604
Dr. Grant?

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.399
Hey, Eric,
how are you doing?

01:08:26.327 --> 01:08:27.953
I'm sorry
about Billy.

01:08:31.832 --> 01:08:34.626
You know what the last thing
I said to him was?

01:08:35.086 --> 01:08:36.420
I said,

01:08:36.837 --> 01:08:39.840
"You're as bad as the people
that built this place."

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:45.386
Which wasn't true.
Billy was just young. That's all.

01:08:47.432 --> 01:08:50.350
I have a theory that there
are two kinds of boys.

01:08:50.435 --> 01:08:52.560
There are those who
want to be astronomers

01:08:52.645 --> 01:08:55.104
and those who
want to be astronauts.

01:08:55.648 --> 01:08:58.567
The astronomer,
or the paleontologist

01:08:58.651 --> 01:09:02.237
gets to study
these amazing things

01:09:02.322 --> 01:09:04.281
from a place of
complete safety.

01:09:04.991 --> 01:09:07.117
But then you never
get to go into space.

01:09:07.201 --> 01:09:08.535
Exactly.

01:09:08.995 --> 01:09:11.997
It's the difference between
imagining and seeing.

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:14.625
To be able
to touch them.

01:09:15.209 --> 01:09:19.379
And that's all Billy wanted.

01:09:26.511 --> 01:09:27.638
Dr. Grant.

01:09:56.751 --> 01:09:58.752
You know something,
Dr. Grant?

01:10:00.546 --> 01:10:01.922
Billy was right.

01:10:27.907 --> 01:10:29.032
Listen.

01:10:49.971 --> 01:10:51.680
Find it before
it stops ringing!

01:10:51.764 --> 01:10:53.682
Eric, you stay on
that boat.

01:10:56.644 --> 01:10:58.854
It's here. It's here.

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:01.606
God.

01:11:08.614 --> 01:11:09.781
I got it.

01:11:17.999 --> 01:11:19.416
Hello? Hello?

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:23.045
You, too, can own a timeshare
in beautiful Guadalajara.

01:11:23.129 --> 01:11:26.006
Enjoy a meal in one of
our four-star restaurants.

01:11:26.132 --> 01:11:27.174
Look out!

01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:49.112
Turn off the power.

01:11:49.197 --> 01:11:51.114
You've got juice
for maybe one call.

01:11:51.199 --> 01:11:53.450
Whatever you do, don't call the U.
S. Embassy.

01:11:53.534 --> 01:11:55.368
They won't do a damn thing.

01:11:55.661 --> 01:11:58.205
Hey, guys, come here!
Look at this!

01:12:04.879 --> 01:12:06.338
Bonitos.

01:12:06.506 --> 01:12:08.006
Something must
have spooked them!

01:12:08.591 --> 01:12:10.675
Get the engine
going, Mr. Kirby.

01:12:18.184 --> 01:12:19.684
Open the throttle!

01:12:26.359 --> 01:12:27.442
Pick up.

01:12:32.907 --> 01:12:33.949
Hello?

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.242
Ellie?

01:12:35.701 --> 01:12:36.868
Hello?

01:12:37.245 --> 01:12:38.286
Charlie!

01:12:39.247 --> 01:12:40.872
Charlie!
Hello?

01:12:41.749 --> 01:12:44.709
Charlie, take the phone
to Mummy now!

01:12:45.586 --> 01:12:47.295
Take the phone to Mummy!

01:12:47.421 --> 01:12:49.589
It's the dinosaur man!

01:12:50.383 --> 01:12:51.383
Okay.

01:12:51.551 --> 01:12:52.592
Listen to me, Charlie.

01:12:53.761 --> 01:12:54.803
Charlie!

01:12:55.888 --> 01:12:58.932
Are you taking the
phone to Mum? Charlie!

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:29.671
Hi, everybody!

01:13:39.432 --> 01:13:41.057
It's great to be here!

01:13:41.142 --> 01:13:43.518
Hi, there! How are you?

01:13:53.112 --> 01:13:54.946
This is going to be great.

01:14:07.793 --> 01:14:10.045
Who's on the phone?
The dinosaur man.

01:14:10.129 --> 01:14:11.755
He is? Alan?

01:14:12.048 --> 01:14:15.008
Look in the boxes!
Find a weapon!

01:14:22.099 --> 01:14:23.975
Where's the phone?

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:25.685
There!
Get the phone!

01:14:35.488 --> 01:14:37.030
Ellie, listen to me!

01:14:37.323 --> 01:14:39.574
Are you on a cell phone?
I can't hear you.

01:14:39.659 --> 01:14:42.827
The river! Site B!
The river!

01:14:45.665 --> 01:14:46.915
Hello?

01:16:53.125 --> 01:16:56.044
Dad! Dad!

01:17:14.313 --> 01:17:15.647
Dad!

01:17:19.985 --> 01:17:21.986
Paul, you jerk!

01:17:24.532 --> 01:17:26.491
You can't leave me
like this!

01:17:29.161 --> 01:17:30.829
I'm not going anywhere!

01:17:47.346 --> 01:17:50.432
Remember when we went fishing
a couple of summers ago?

01:17:51.267 --> 01:17:54.561
I was putting the boat in the
water and the trailer sank?

01:17:55.521 --> 01:17:59.065
The tow truck tried to pull us
out and it got dragged in, too.

01:18:00.025 --> 01:18:02.735
The truck driver wanted
to knock my lights out.

01:18:08.367 --> 01:18:09.701
I miss fishing.

01:18:15.541 --> 01:18:16.708
Mr. Kirby?

01:18:21.714 --> 01:18:24.382
That lady you called.
Who is she?

01:18:25.301 --> 01:18:27.385
How do you know
that she can help us?

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:29.471
She's the one person
I could always count on.

01:18:29.555 --> 01:18:30.763
I owe her a lot.

01:18:31.891 --> 01:18:33.808
I don't think
I ever told her that.

01:18:33.893 --> 01:18:34.934
You should.

01:18:37.938 --> 01:18:39.230
You hear that?

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:42.066
The ocean.

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:00.335
They want the eggs.

01:19:01.462 --> 01:19:03.588
Otherwise,
we'd be dead already.

01:19:08.761 --> 01:19:12.013
Everybody get down.
She's challenging us.

01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:33.368
She thinks
you stole the eggs.

01:19:33.452 --> 01:19:34.577
Get behind me.

01:19:54.974 --> 01:19:57.976
Give me the eggs.

01:20:18.831 --> 01:20:19.998
Do it, Mum.

01:20:38.851 --> 01:20:40.685
No. Call for help.

01:21:27.566 --> 01:21:29.067
That's a helicopter.

01:21:38.744 --> 01:21:41.829
Dr. Grant?
Dr. Alan Grant?

01:21:41.914 --> 01:21:43.373
Stop!

01:21:43.457 --> 01:21:46.000
That's a very bad idea!

01:21:54.593 --> 01:21:56.511
Second Squad, move!
Wow!

01:21:57.554 --> 01:22:01.182
You have to thank her now.
She sent the Navy and the Marines.

01:22:02.935 --> 01:22:04.686
God bless you, Ellie.

01:22:16.699 --> 01:22:19.283
Dr. Grant, is this man with you?
What?

01:22:29.378 --> 01:22:30.628
You made it.

01:22:32.172 --> 01:22:33.381
Yeah.

01:22:34.341 --> 01:22:35.967
I rescued your hat.

01:22:36.969 --> 01:22:38.678
Dr. Grant,
we need to go now!

01:22:38.762 --> 01:22:40.054
Oh, yeah.

01:22:42.391 --> 01:22:44.559
Well, that's
the important thing.

01:22:45.144 --> 01:22:46.227
Dr. Grant!

01:22:48.814 --> 01:22:51.482
Can I get you to sit
here and buckle up, sir?

01:22:58.365 --> 01:23:01.909
Sea Shadow to Dust Storm,
six souls on board.

01:23:03.662 --> 01:23:05.747
Dust Storm to
Sea Shadow, roger.

01:23:10.419 --> 01:23:12.044
What the hell is that?

01:23:13.338 --> 01:23:14.922
Dr. Grant, look!

01:23:24.850 --> 01:23:26.851
Where do you think
they're going?

01:23:27.728 --> 01:23:30.772
I don't know. Maybe just looking
for new nesting grounds.

01:23:30.856 --> 01:23:32.857
It's a whole
new world for them.

01:23:32.941 --> 01:23:35.359
I dare them to nest
in Enid, Oklahoma.

01:23:42.284 --> 01:23:43.534
Let's go home.
