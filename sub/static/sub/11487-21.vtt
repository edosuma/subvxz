00:02.200 --> 00:05.636
Alan, do you ever fantasize
when we're making love?

00:05.800 --> 00:10.590
Well, occasionally l pretend
that l'm better looking.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.389
What about you?

00:13.560 --> 00:17.997
Sometimes l imagine we're
in the middle of a big department store.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.029
Having sex?

00:20.200 --> 00:22.714
No, shopping.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.750
Why would l fantasize about having sex
while l'm having sex?

00:27.360 --> 00:31.353
Do you think about ham and cheese
when you're eating a sandwich?

00:31.840 --> 00:34.115
Can't argue with that.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.273
What you thinking?

00:40.480 --> 00:45.315
Nothing really. l just--
l got a call from Jake's school today.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.074
You know who called me?
Jessica Murray.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.229
Oh, who's that?

00:49.400 --> 00:51.595
A friend of mine.

00:53.440 --> 00:55.715
Yeah, well. . . .

00:56.040 --> 00:59.953
Anyway, Jake's mom and l have to go to
a parent-teacher conference tomorrow. . .

01:00.120 --> 01:02.190
. . .and l don't really know
what it's about.

01:04.239 --> 01:08.199
Hey, do you ever pretend
your toes are little people?

01:08.440 --> 01:10.032
What? No.

01:10.200 --> 01:15.035
Sometimes l make believe they're
different families playing Family Feud.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.357
All right, let's meet our champions.

01:17.520 --> 01:23.595
He goes to market, she stays home,
please welcome the Piggy family.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.079
Hi, everybody.

01:25.240 --> 01:30.598
You're going down Piggy family.
You're going down.

01:35.520 --> 01:38.318
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:39.480 --> 01:43.553
He's shooting 5 1 percent
from beyond the arc. That's pretty good.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.713
How's it going?

01:52.880 --> 01:54.279
Forget it, Alan.

01:54.960 --> 01:59.238
l only do the aprÃ©s-sex chat
with people l've just had sex with.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.756
Come on. She's playing
Family Feud with her toes.

02:02.920 --> 02:06.959
l don't care if she's playing banjo
with her nipples.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.636
l need to communicate
after lovemaking. l need to share.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.314
You should have thought of that
before boinking a girl. . .

02:13.480 --> 02:15.038
. . .with the lQ of Tickle Me Elmo.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.316
Fine.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.679
Hey, Berta. How's it going?

02:22.840 --> 02:23.909
Back off, zippy.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.550
You want pillow talk,
you gotta spoon me first.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:43.160 --> 02:46.118
l suppose l could talk about
his grades again. . .

02:46.280 --> 02:49.955
. . .but l think we all agree
that ship has pretty much sailed.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.835
So why did you wanna see us?

02:54.000 --> 02:58.755
Well, l'm concerned
that even outside of the classroom. . .

02:58.920 --> 03:02.390
. . .Jake has no interest in anything
that goes on around here.

03:02.560 --> 03:07.111
Now, hang on. He speaks very highly
of your hot lunch program.

03:07.920 --> 03:12.914
Well, l was talking more about hobbies
or extracurricular activities.

03:13.080 --> 03:14.957
Well, l don't know about his father. . .

03:15.120 --> 03:17.918
. . .but l've tried to share
some of my interests with him.

03:18.080 --> 03:22.198
Unfortunately, he's a little young
to drink in the dark and bitch about men.

03:26.920 --> 03:29.036
You know. . .

03:29.200 --> 03:34.069
. . .l was kind of lacking in focus
when l was his age too. . .

03:34.240 --> 03:36.310
. . .till l got bit by the old theater bug.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.040
Too bad you didn't get bit
by the old rabid squirrel.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.797
You know, l'm organizing
a drama club.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.679
Would that be something
Jake would have any interest in. . .

03:47.840 --> 03:50.115
. . .or do you think he gets
enough drama at home?

03:52.400 --> 03:54.152
All the world's a stage.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.719
And we are merely players.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.833
Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.032
She say what l'm in trouble for?

04:08.200 --> 04:09.952
Nope.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.429
Boy, it's the not knowing
that drives you crazy.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.797
Yeah, like a pregnancy test.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.552
Yeah.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.790
l don't get it.

04:23.240 --> 04:26.232
Yes. ln your face, Opie.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.993
This game stinks.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.752
No, you stink at it.

04:30.320 --> 04:31.639
That was my lunch money.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.473
Oh, your lunch money,
why didn't you tell me?

04:34.640 --> 04:37.871
Boo-freaking-hoo. Pack a sandwich.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.873
Okay, Jake, well, we talked
to Miss Sheffield.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.439
l'm sorry.

04:43.600 --> 04:47.149
-What are you sorry about?
-l'm. . . .

04:47.640 --> 04:50.154
l'm sorry l interrupted you. Go ahead.

04:50.760 --> 04:54.753
lt would be a good idea if you got
involved in extracurricular activities.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.239
Oh, okay.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.994
Great, great.
We'll talk about it at home.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.595
Do you know
what an ''extracurricular activity'' is?

05:04.760 --> 05:07.593
Who cares? l'm off the hook.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.957
-What do you think?
-What was this all about?

05:27.120 --> 05:29.759
-lt's choreography.
-lt's gay.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.839
Okay.
Forget about the movements.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.433
-Just try singing the song.
-No.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.353
-Why not?
-Because it's gay.

05:37.920 --> 05:38.909
Don't encourage him.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.389
Don't make him sing
Gilbert and Sullivan.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.515
He needs something to audition for the
school musical. You teach him a song.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.352
-Why don't you let him choose?
-Jake.

05:47.520 --> 05:51.877
-Tell you uncle what you wanted to sing.
-lt's called ''Whup That Stanky Ho. ''

05:56.920 --> 05:59.639
All right. There's gotta be
some middle ground here.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.471
-You like classic rock, right?
-Yeah.

06:02.640 --> 06:04.073
Okay, well, pick a band.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.154
How about Queen?

06:06.320 --> 06:09.118
Oh, good. l was afraid
he was gonna pick something gay.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.551
Doesn't sound right.

06:38.720 --> 06:41.154
You heard it too, huh?

06:41.760 --> 06:44.718
-You sure you played all the right notes?
-Yes, l'm sure.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.235
lt doesn't sound anything like
Queen's version.

06:47.720 --> 06:49.790
No, it doesn't.

06:49.960 --> 06:53.191
Why don't you work on it.
We'll try again tomorrow.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.838
Yeah, why don't l do that.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.592
The kid's a double threat:

06:59.760 --> 07:01.990
tone-deaf and arrogant.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.159
-Hey.
-Where have you been?

07:05.320 --> 07:06.548
Kandi called for you.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.358
Oh, l had to work late.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.119
Yeah, one of my regular patients
had a crisis.

07:12.280 --> 07:15.989
His name is Roger, he had
a couple of vertebrae pinching a nerve.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.071
-Too bad.
-Nice guy, you'd like him.

07:19.080 --> 07:22.311
He restores old cars. Well, it's
actually more a hobby than a job.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.994
He works at Staples.
His name is Roger.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.913
-Alan.
-Yeah?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.752
Why are you lying to me?

07:29.560 --> 07:31.278
l don't know. l really suck at it.

07:31.800 --> 07:32.915
You do indeed.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.039
Don't you care where l was?

07:36.720 --> 07:38.631
Why would l start now?

07:39.400 --> 07:42.119
Oh, come on, l really need to get this
off my chest.

07:42.280 --> 07:43.872
All right, go ahead.

07:45.520 --> 07:49.308
-l was with another woman.
-Okay, okay, see, that's a good lie.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.918
No, no. l really was
with another woman.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.750
Seriously?

07:55.920 --> 07:59.230
You're already doing a hot 22-year-old
and you're cheating on her?

08:00.920 --> 08:01.909
Yes.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.390
l am so proud of you.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.828
-What?
-Who's the dog? My brother's the dog.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.992
Come on, dog. Come on, dog.
Howl with me.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.115
No, stop howling and let me explain.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.952
There's nothing to explain.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.590
You're sleeping with two women
at the same time. You're a big old dog.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.115
No, l haven't been sleeping
with the other woman.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.479
l've been seeing Jake's teacher.

08:42.880 --> 08:43.914
All we do is talk.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.479
l don't know how to explain it.
We have so much in common.

08:50.640 --> 08:53.108
l mean, she's divorced.
She has a kid Jake's age.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.838
She reads. She likes the theater.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.116
Yeah, yeah. But you're not
sleeping with her?

08:57.280 --> 09:01.239
-Why would l when l've got Kandi?
-l don't know. Because you can?

09:02.160 --> 09:04.754
lt's not that kind of a relationship.
lt's intellectual.

09:05.160 --> 09:09.153
So take her to a museum, enjoy
the exhibits and do her in the restroom.

09:09.880 --> 09:12.474
-You're missing the point.
-No, you're missing the point.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.392
Not getting laid, it's not cheating.

09:14.560 --> 09:18.394
-Then why do l feel so guilty?
-That's easy. Because you're an idiot.

09:18.840 --> 09:22.799
l guess l always thought that one woman
was supposed to fulfill all my needs.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.712
Oh, that's an old wives' tale.

09:24.880 --> 09:28.919
Started to protect the interests of,
you guessed it, old wives.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.079
So you're saying the whole concept
of monogamy is a fraud.

09:32.240 --> 09:35.152
-The institution of marriage is a sham?
-No, no, no.

09:35.320 --> 09:38.551
l'm just saying, bang the teacher.

09:40.520 --> 09:43.751
Why does he make everything
so complicated?

09:49.440 --> 09:51.908
Here we go.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.674
''Blunderbuss. ''

09:54.840 --> 09:57.149
Very elegant use of my ''under. ''

09:57.320 --> 09:58.389
Thank you.

09:59.840 --> 10:02.957
Boy. l have more vowels
than a Honolulu phone book.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.512
You're so clever, Alan.

10:05.680 --> 10:08.911
Thank you. You am smart too.

10:09.080 --> 10:13.915
-Hey, Alan, can l talk to you for a sec?
-Sure. Excuse me.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.638
Hurry back.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.029
What's up?

10:19.200 --> 10:22.590
-You tell me.
-Nothing, we're just playing Scrabble.

10:22.760 --> 10:23.875
And you're right.

10:24.040 --> 10:27.669
-There's nothing to feel guilty about.
-Good to know. Because Kandi's here.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.431
Oh, okay.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.949
lt's not a problem.
Here's what we do.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.873
-We?
-Come on, work with me.

10:39.960 --> 10:43.509
You go cover for me with Kandi
and l'll get Francine the hell out of here.

10:43.680 --> 10:45.671
But there was nothing
to feel guilty about.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.593
You know that and l know that,
now go lie to Kandi about it.

10:49.640 --> 10:52.757
Fine, l'll tell her you went to Staples
to see Roger.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.717
Who?

10:57.000 --> 11:00.959
-Hey, why don't we walk on the beach.
-What about the game?

11:01.120 --> 11:03.395
Screw the game, l concede.
You win, well-played.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.356
All right.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.033
lt is a beautiful night.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.953
Yeah, yeah. Let's go enjoy it
on the beach. Chop-chop.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.309
-Kandi?
-What?

11:19.480 --> 11:21.118
Alan must have slipped out.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.999
-You're lying to me, Charlie.
-No, l'm not.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.718
Oh, okay.

11:25.880 --> 11:27.996
Wait, wait. Don't you wanna know
where he is?

11:28.160 --> 11:30.993
-Where who is?
-Alan.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.594
Sure, why not.

11:34.280 --> 11:37.317
All right. The truth is. . .

11:37.480 --> 11:39.994
. . .Alan is out trying to find
the perfect gift for you.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.593
-Really?
-Yes.

11:41.760 --> 11:46.038
He wants to surprise you
with something extremely expensive.

11:47.800 --> 11:48.994
Can you give me a hint?

11:49.160 --> 11:50.673
Well, let's see.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.910
lt's something
that's a girl's best friend. . .

11:53.080 --> 11:55.799
. . .and looks good
wrapped around their neck.

11:56.320 --> 11:59.357
l'm getting a monkey?

12:00.880 --> 12:04.873
No, no. Sweet Lord.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.632
A diamond necklace.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.195
That's nice too.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.990
Just remember,
you didn't hear it from me.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.991
Then who did l hear it from?

12:16.520 --> 12:18.795
Nobody.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.076
When he gives it to you,
act surprised.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.470
Don't worry, l'll be really surprised.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.995
Good. Good. Good.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.720
So will he.

13:00.760 --> 13:03.832
That's-- That's-- That's terrific.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.389
-Do you wanna hear it again?
-No.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.516
We don't want you
to strain your voice.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.830
Do you think l'm gonna do okay
at the audition?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.639
-You never know how these things go.
-Yeah.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.793
Just hope l have
a decent piano player.

13:20.640 --> 13:23.200
l thought you were working with him.
What's the problem?

13:23.360 --> 13:25.669
Okay, there's a technical term
we musicians use.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.959
Jake stinks.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.032
Well, is there anything we can do?

13:32.200 --> 13:35.158
We can hope ''stinks''
suddenly becomes popular.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.390
But l wouldn't count on it.

13:37.560 --> 13:41.030
Oh, by the way, you need
to buy Kandi a diamond necklace.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.679
What?

13:42.840 --> 13:45.752
You told me to cover.
l said you were out buying her jewelry.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.478
That's all you could think of?

13:48.120 --> 13:52.159
Well, l could think of a lot of things
but only one made me laugh.

13:52.960 --> 13:55.838
l can't afford to buy her jewelry.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.191
l know.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.552
That's what makes it funny.

14:06.160 --> 14:08.594
Must have been so expensive.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.990
Yeah.

14:11.160 --> 14:15.312
You do realize this entitles you
to extra-special bonus sex.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.275
What is extra-special bonus sex?

14:18.800 --> 14:21.360
lt's whatever you want it to be.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.675
That sounds like fun.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.873
Go away.

14:28.560 --> 14:32.189
Okay, l'll just play Scrabble
till you're ready.

14:33.760 --> 14:35.318
Give me a sec.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.871
Please don't tell me Francine is here.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.073
Okay.

14:44.240 --> 14:45.912
Wait, wait, wait.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.069
Francine is here?

14:47.240 --> 14:49.310
-Yeah, you want me to cover for you?
-Yes.

14:49.480 --> 14:50.708
l'm on it.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.758
Wait. Charlie, l'm begging you.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.148
No more jewelry.

14:55.320 --> 14:58.198
Don't worry. lt's not funny twice.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.958
Sorry, he must have gone out.

15:05.440 --> 15:08.273
Oh, okay. Tell him l stopped by.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.710
Francine, wait.

15:12.880 --> 15:13.915
l can't do this.

15:14.560 --> 15:15.549
Do what?

15:16.120 --> 15:17.872
l'm not a good liar.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.868
l know where he is,
l'm just not supposed to tell you.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.995
The thing is, Alan does
a lot of charity work.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.318
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.951
Right now he's down
at the nursing home. . .

15:32.120 --> 15:34.236
. . .giving sponge baths to old people.

15:35.960 --> 15:39.430
They don't go out a lot
so they tend to get dusty.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.069
l had no idea.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.872
ln fact, just the other night
he was down on skid row. . .

15:45.040 --> 15:48.112
. . .teaching salsa dancing
to crack addicts.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.319
Oh, my goodness.

15:50.480 --> 15:53.233
They have the energy,
they just lack the focus.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.630
But l think-- l think what he's
proudest of is his work with the kids.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.394
He takes runaways forced to live
on the streets. . .

16:02.560 --> 16:04.755
. . .and teaches them how to live
in the woods.

16:06.560 --> 16:11.839
l don't really see the point but those
little urchins seem to thrive in the wild.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.070
lt's like he's a saint.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.073
You must be so proud to have him
as your brother.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.433
Well, truth be told,
he does bring me a lot of joy.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.231
Thank you for telling me this, Charlie.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.470
You're welcome.

16:26.640 --> 16:29.029
Just promise you won't
embarrass him bringing it up.

16:29.200 --> 16:33.318
Not a word.
l just hope l can be worthy of him.

16:35.640 --> 16:38.791
And the plot moistens.

16:42.320 --> 16:46.552
Oh, that's terrific, buddy.
l am so proud of you.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.711
Yeah, sure, l'll tell him.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.838
Oh, all right. Love you. Bye-bye.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.115
Guess what.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.192
Jake just got the lead
in the school musical.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.873
The lead?

16:58.040 --> 17:00.998
What happened, did every other kid
in school get mono?

17:01.640 --> 17:03.312
No, l think it was Francine.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.233
l think she cast Jake
because of our relationship.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.393
You mean it's gotten physical?
You're sleeping his way to the top?

17:10.880 --> 17:13.916
No, no.
Nothing happened between us.

17:14.079 --> 17:17.310
-But l think she's fallen for me.
-Really?

17:17.480 --> 17:18.913
What makes you think that?

17:19.640 --> 17:22.915
Well, l had lunch with her today
and she was looking at me with. . .

17:23.079 --> 17:24.718
. . .l don't know. . .

17:24.880 --> 17:27.189
. . .worship in her eyes.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.032
Like l was some kind of--

17:29.480 --> 17:31.357
-Saint?
-Yes, yes.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.309
How did you know?

17:34.240 --> 17:36.037
That's how l think of you.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.839
Very funny. l've been
doing my best not to lead her on. . .

17:39.000 --> 17:43.278
. . .but l guess l just underestimated
my allure.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.229
Say that again.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.917
-What?
-That last part.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.150
You mean,
l underestimated my allure?

17:52.840 --> 17:54.751
Yeah, that's it.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.551
l'm sorry, am l missing something?

17:58.280 --> 17:59.872
No, not a thing.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.155
Well, good.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.709
You see, Alan. That's how you lie.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.510
Pretty exciting, huh? Opening night.

18:17.960 --> 18:21.430
Well, having seen the previews,
l'm betting closing night too.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.951
Boy, this brings back memories.

18:24.120 --> 18:27.351
Sixth grade was the happiest
two years of my life.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.359
lt's the finger.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.996
Excuse me.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.595
So, Kandi, what's your
favorite musical?

18:41.760 --> 18:43.478
The trombone.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.871
l can't believe you brought her here.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.758
l had to, Jake invited her.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.997
ls that a diamond necklace?
You never gave me a diamond necklace.

18:55.160 --> 18:58.789
Yeah, well, you never gave me
extra-special bonus sex.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.279
-Hi, Charlie.
-Hi.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.556
-Who's this?
-This? Oh, this is Kandi.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.153
Hi, l'm with Alan.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.553
Are you one of those young people
he takes care of?

19:08.720 --> 19:12.759
Yep, yep, yep. Good old Saint Alan.
Just can't do enough for the kids.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.036
Look at this diamond necklace
he gave me.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.831
He gave you a diamond necklace?

19:18.000 --> 19:22.039
Don't get the wrong idea,
it wasn't to get me to have sex.

19:22.480 --> 19:25.438
l was already doing
everything he wanted.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.353
l am as shocked as you are.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.553
What was that about?

20:11.720 --> 20:14.632
Funny story. l'll tell you later.
