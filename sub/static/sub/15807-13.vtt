01:24.885 --> 01:26.417
hi, skipper.

01:26.486 --> 01:28.287
What are you doing,
gilligan?

01:28.355 --> 01:29.554
Mr. howell's teaching me
how to play golf

01:29.623 --> 01:32.057
and even gave me
this club to use.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.925
And I gave you
this hammer to use.

01:33.994 --> 01:36.394
I just took
a little time out to
practice my driving.

01:36.463 --> 01:38.630
Well, if you'd like
to practice your driving,
gilligan

01:38.699 --> 01:41.566
start on those nails!

01:41.635 --> 01:43.167
I want that watch tower
finished by tonight.

01:43.236 --> 01:44.769
Well, why the big rush?

01:44.838 --> 01:45.904
Just because you
dreamed a ship is going
to go by the island?

01:45.973 --> 01:47.572
Don't forget, gilligan,

01:47.641 --> 01:49.174
this is the third
night in a row
I've had that dream.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.576
Oh, come on, skipper, you
don't believe in dreams.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.043
And what's more

01:52.112 --> 01:54.312
this is the third day
of the week of
the third month.

01:54.381 --> 01:55.613
With all those
3s coming up

01:55.682 --> 01:57.516
are you gonna tell me
that I'm wrong?

01:57.585 --> 01:59.184
No, sir, I'm not gonna
tell you you're wrong.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.153
'Cause you're 3 times
bigger than I am.

02:01.221 --> 02:03.388
Gilligan, get to work!

02:03.456 --> 02:04.723
Now, really, gilligan,

02:04.791 --> 02:06.558
when I have these dreams,
they always come true.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.393
Well, not always,
skipper.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.693
How about the time
you dreamed I was gonna
hit you in the jaw?

02:09.763 --> 02:11.129
Well?

02:11.198 --> 02:12.831
I wouldn't do
a thing like that.
That'd be mutiny.

02:12.900 --> 02:13.865
Yeah.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.199
Not only that,
it'd be suicide.

02:15.268 --> 02:17.035
I forgot about that one.
Ha ha ha ha.

02:17.103 --> 02:19.338
You see, skipper,
there's nothing to
all those dreams.

02:19.406 --> 02:20.739
Here, watch
my practice swing

02:20.808 --> 02:22.807
and tell me what
I'm doing wrong.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.677
Hmm?

02:25.746 --> 02:27.246
Alright, gilligan.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.849
Head down,
left arm stiff

02:30.917 --> 02:33.551
your eye on the ball.

02:33.620 --> 02:34.686
[Thump]

02:37.223 --> 02:38.556
Was that you, skipper?

02:38.625 --> 02:39.657
Uh-huh.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.660
Where'd I hit you?

02:41.729 --> 02:44.095
Right in the jaw.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.864
Just like you
dreamed, huh?

02:45.933 --> 02:48.967
Yep, just like
i dreamed.

02:49.035 --> 02:50.502
Well, I better
get back to work.

02:50.571 --> 02:53.272
That ship could be
coming by any minute.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.555
Oh, I never thought
I'd make that one.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.023
What did I get
on the hole, dear?

03:12.092 --> 03:14.692
Now, let me see.
3, 4...

03:14.761 --> 03:16.895
You did much better
this time, darling.

03:16.963 --> 03:18.397
You got a 34.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.198
34? I finally
parred the hole.

03:20.266 --> 03:22.400
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.734
Are you going to
play another round?

03:23.803 --> 03:25.570
No, I think I'll
practice a little.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.773
This oyster shell
putter just doesn't
feel right.

03:27.841 --> 03:31.009
But of course it doesn't.
There's no "r" in the month.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.745
I'll see you
back at the hut, dear.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.447
Ha ha ha ha.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.991
Hi, Mr. howell.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.059
Look, gilligan,
never talk when
a man is putting.

03:48.128 --> 03:49.694
I'm sorry, Mr. howell.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.331
Yes, well, that's
perfectly alright.
It's alright.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.699
I just wanted
to say hello.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.702
Look, go stand
over there, will you?

03:56.770 --> 03:58.703
Putting is the hardest
part of the game.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.872
It requires
the utmost silence!

04:02.142 --> 04:03.075
I won't say
another word.

04:03.143 --> 04:04.876
Oh, gilligan.

04:04.944 --> 04:06.778
I'm sorry, but i
don't see what's so
tough about it, though.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.479
Oh, you don't see
what's so tough about it?

04:08.548 --> 04:09.781
Well, then you just try it.
Just go ahead, try, try.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.416
I'd better not.
The skipper told me--

04:11.484 --> 04:14.653
I don't care
what the skipper says.
Go ahead. Putt.

04:14.721 --> 04:16.922
So easy? Putt.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.063
Well, that was, uh,
just beginner's luck.

04:25.132 --> 04:28.266
Besides, I wasn't talking
while you were putting,
my boy.

04:28.334 --> 04:31.603
Yes, you just try putting
while someone is saying
something stupid, like, uh

04:31.672 --> 04:34.106
"hello, Mr. howell.
Sorry, Mr. howell.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.108
Looks easy to me,
Mr. howell."

04:36.176 --> 04:37.408
Has this thing
on his shoulder.

04:37.477 --> 04:38.743
Stomp, stomp, stomp.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.945
You just try putting
while I'm talking.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.615
Go ahead, putt
while I'm talking.
Go ahead, putt, putt, putt.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.782
I did.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.284
Where's the ball?

04:46.353 --> 04:47.919
In the hole.
In the hole.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.757
Alright, well,
that's 2 lucky breaks.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.125
That doesn't mean
a darn thing.

04:53.193 --> 04:54.725
I tell you what
I'm going to do.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.596
I'm going to bet
you anything you can't
do it again, alright?

04:57.665 --> 04:58.429
All I got is a quarter,
Mr. howell.

04:58.498 --> 05:00.265
Alright, that's good.

05:00.334 --> 05:04.469
Yeah, when you're putting
with money, there's pressure.
There's pressure.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.738
Yeah, trying putting
when you bet--

05:08.641 --> 05:09.740
see you later,
Mr. howell.

05:09.809 --> 05:10.975
I got to get this
over to the tower.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.078
Oh, no, you don't.
Absolutely not.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.112
You got to give me a chance
to get my money back.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.314
But the skipper
told me--

05:16.383 --> 05:18.383
I don't care what
the skipper told you!

05:18.452 --> 05:20.318
Alright, now this one.
Double or nothing.

05:20.387 --> 05:23.221
Ah, the pressure.
This one is for 50 cents.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.090
Okay.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.092
Now can I go,
Mr. howell?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.694
I'll tell you
when to go.

05:29.763 --> 05:33.097
Young man, I think
your luck is running out.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.399
This one's for a dollar.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.867
[Rattle]

05:35.936 --> 05:37.636
$2.00's says I'm right.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.572
Alright. Come on,
gilligan, and putt.

05:41.641 --> 05:42.808
But I can't see
the hole.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.543
Well, I can see it.

05:45.612 --> 05:46.744
Double or nothing.

05:46.813 --> 05:47.913
I ought to be going,
Mr. howell.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.547
You're not going anywhere.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.349
Nobody hustles me
on a golf course.

05:51.418 --> 05:52.583
But you said we
could quit at 10:30.

05:52.652 --> 05:55.654
Will you stop watching
the clock and putt?

05:59.426 --> 06:00.358
[Rattle]

06:00.427 --> 06:02.360
Oh...I'm sorry,
Mr. howell,

06:02.429 --> 06:03.828
but I think
i did it again.

06:03.896 --> 06:06.230
Cut out the chatter,
will ya, gilligan?

06:06.299 --> 06:07.532
We'll be out here all night.

06:07.601 --> 06:10.468
I'll light the hole.
Come on, putt.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.337
Boy, I wonder what
the skipper's gonna say?

06:12.406 --> 06:13.905
I'll tell ya
what he's gonna say!

06:13.973 --> 06:15.940
Never mind, skipper.
I think I can guess.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.243
Captain, will you please
get off the putting green?

06:18.311 --> 06:20.044
Gilligan and i
have a little bet.

06:20.113 --> 06:23.748
A bet? Gilligan,
what have I told you
about gambling?

06:23.817 --> 06:25.884
I know, skipper.
But I only bet a quarter,
and I won.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.752
You won.
Don't you realize

06:27.821 --> 06:29.954
that's the worst thing
that could've happened
to you?

06:30.023 --> 06:31.055
It is?

06:31.124 --> 06:32.557
Well, certainly.
You'd have been
better off

06:32.626 --> 06:34.059
if you had lost
the 25 cents.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.260
Yes! I couldn't agree
with you more, captain.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.562
Come on, gilligan, putt.

06:37.630 --> 06:38.896
Just a moment, howell.

06:38.965 --> 06:40.799
This boy doesn't know
what he's doing.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.400
Gilligan, I know
exactly what's going on
in your mind.

06:42.469 --> 06:43.902
You do?

06:43.970 --> 06:45.837
Certainly.
You've gotten
a little ahead

06:45.906 --> 06:47.172
and it looks like
a pretty easy way of
making some money.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.373
Sure does.

06:48.442 --> 06:49.774
Well, that's where
you're wrong.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.242
How much do you think
you can win gambling?

06:51.311 --> 06:53.177
$6 million
if I sink this putt.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.947
You see?
A whole afternoon
wasted and for what?

06:56.016 --> 06:57.315
What?

06:57.384 --> 06:59.451
I already won $3 million.
We're playing
double or nothing.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.254
Put that putter down,
gilligan.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.556
The game is over.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.257
Just a moment,
captain.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.559
The game's over,
Mr. howell.

07:08.628 --> 07:10.195
And, frankly,
I'm surprised.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.529
I didn't realize
that you were that sort
of a man.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.265
What sort of a man?

07:13.333 --> 07:14.899
The sort of a man
who would take advantage
of this boy

07:14.968 --> 07:17.035
just because he has
a lot of money.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.912
I'd love to have seen
the look on howell's face

07:27.981 --> 07:29.480
when you won
all that money
from him last night.

07:29.549 --> 07:30.982
So would I,
but it was too dark.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.251
Excuse me.
Watch the fire.
It's hot.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.953
Thanks, gilligan.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.021
Gilligan?

07:37.090 --> 07:37.689
Huh?

07:37.757 --> 07:40.658
Come over here.

07:40.727 --> 07:42.460
Sit down
right next to me.

07:42.529 --> 07:43.962
And me.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.563
Oh, gee, gilligan.
I'm so proud of you.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.797
You know
what I'm gonna do?

07:46.866 --> 07:48.466
Fix you anything
you'd like for breakfast.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.936
And I'm gonna fix you
anything you'd like
for lunch.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.170
How come everybody's
being so nice to me?

07:53.239 --> 07:54.605
Because you're
so sweet...

07:54.674 --> 07:56.508
And tall...
And handsome.

07:56.577 --> 07:57.509
I'll say.

07:57.578 --> 07:58.943
Oh, there's lots
of reasons.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.379
Yes. About
3 million of them.

08:01.448 --> 08:02.714
Come on,
little buddy.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.482
I think we'd better
have a little talk.

08:04.551 --> 08:06.084
Okay, skipper.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.719
Gilligan!

08:09.789 --> 08:10.855
Did I do something
wrong, skipper?

08:10.924 --> 08:13.992
Of course not.
Sit down.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.893
Here, take my chair.

08:15.962 --> 08:18.830
What did you want
to talk to me about,
skipper?

08:18.899 --> 08:21.933
Gilligan, you never
had $3 million before,
have you?

08:22.002 --> 08:24.535
Um...

08:24.604 --> 08:25.804
No, sir, I haven't.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.406
I didn't think so.
Let me tell you something.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.641
You're gonna find
a big change in some
of the people around here.

08:30.710 --> 08:31.776
What do you mean?

08:31.845 --> 08:33.878
Well, take this morning,
for example.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.746
Number one:
The professor
never offered

08:35.815 --> 08:36.981
to build you
a fire before,
right?

08:37.049 --> 08:37.982
Right.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.751
Number 2: Mary Ann
never offered

08:39.818 --> 08:41.452
to fix you
a special breakfast
before, right?

08:41.520 --> 08:43.054
Right.
Number 3:

08:43.121 --> 08:45.257
Ginger never offered
to fix you lunch before,
right?

08:45.325 --> 08:47.091
Right. And what
about number 4?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.426
4--number 4?

08:48.494 --> 08:51.062
Yeah. I never sat in
your chair before,
right?

08:51.131 --> 08:53.365
Right, uh...

08:53.433 --> 08:55.166
Believe me, it won't be
the last time.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.268
Little buddy, anytime
that you have a problem

08:57.337 --> 08:59.470
I want you to come
in this hut,
sit in my chair

08:59.539 --> 09:01.539
and tell your skipper
all about it.

09:01.608 --> 09:02.840
Tell you all about what?

09:02.909 --> 09:04.276
Anything that you're
worried about.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.776
Skipper, I'm not
worried about anything.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.378
Skipper:
But that's impossible.

09:07.447 --> 09:10.748
Anyone with $3 million
has got to be worried
about something.

09:10.817 --> 09:11.782
Gilligan:
Skipper, I don't
have it yet.

09:11.851 --> 09:12.784
Mr. howell just
owes it to me.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.419
I wouldn't worry
about that.

09:14.488 --> 09:17.722
I'm gonna go out
right now and get you
a check for $3 million.

09:17.790 --> 09:18.990
You don't have to go
to all that trouble.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.826
It's no trouble.
That's what I'm here for...

09:21.895 --> 09:22.961
Son.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.030
Son?

09:26.099 --> 09:28.833
Gilligan, that's the way
I've always felt about you.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.102
You've been like
my own boy to me.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.905
I have? Gosh,
i didn't know that,
skipper.

09:33.974 --> 09:37.575
Skipper? Why don't you
just call me dad?

09:37.644 --> 09:38.943
Okay, skipper.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.979
I told you to call me dad,
and that's an order!

09:41.047 --> 09:42.814
Yes, sir, dad.

09:44.183 --> 09:45.116
That's better.

09:46.686 --> 09:49.120
Now I'll go out
and find Mr. howell
and get you your money.

09:49.189 --> 09:52.089
Oh, and, son,
i don't want you
to leave this hut.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.824
But Mary Ann said
she's gonna fix me
breakfast.

09:53.893 --> 09:56.627
Your father will fix you
breakfast when he gets back.

09:56.696 --> 09:57.628
Ooh!

09:57.697 --> 09:59.497
Watch the beam, dad.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.132
Thanks a lot, son.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.346
Ah, good morning,
gilligan.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.648
Is the captain in?

10:16.717 --> 10:18.516
No. He's out
looking for you.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.352
I'm sorry I missed him.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.853
I just stopped by
to pay my debt

10:21.922 --> 10:26.157
to give you a check
for $3 million that I...

10:28.762 --> 10:31.062
It's made out--
but first of all

10:31.130 --> 10:33.331
you have to fill out
an income tax form.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.532
Income tax form?

10:34.601 --> 10:36.334
Yes. I didn't know what
your salary was.

10:36.402 --> 10:39.170
I was afraid that $3 million
might kick you into
a higher income bracket.

10:39.239 --> 10:39.971
You know what I mean?

10:40.040 --> 10:40.972
It's looks tough
to fill out?

10:41.041 --> 10:42.473
I'd be very glad
to help you.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.842
Now, first of all,
you have to list
all your dependents.

10:44.911 --> 10:47.011
Do you have a wife
or children?

10:47.080 --> 10:49.013
No. But I got a father
about 5 minutes ago.

10:49.082 --> 10:53.317
What is wrong with me?
This is the wrong paper.

10:53.386 --> 10:54.686
This is the short form.

10:54.754 --> 10:55.787
There's a longer form?

10:55.855 --> 10:57.455
Yes. There's a much
longer form.

10:57.524 --> 11:00.291
Of course we could
put your money in
your corporate structure.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.592
I thought I'd just
put it in my wallet.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.895
No. Oh!

11:05.765 --> 11:09.600
No. No, with $3 million,
my boy, you have got to get
yourself a tax shelter.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.302
What's the matter
with this place?

11:11.370 --> 11:13.537
Gilligan, I don't believe
you know what this money
could do to you.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.873
So far, it's gotten me
breakfast, lunch,
and the skipper's chair.

11:15.942 --> 11:18.710
You're terribly naive
about financial matters.

11:18.778 --> 11:19.710
You don't want this money.

11:19.779 --> 11:21.246
I don't?

11:21.314 --> 11:23.248
No. You'd be much
better off, instead
of the $3 million

11:23.316 --> 11:25.350
if I gave you one
of my corporations.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.318
Oh, I couldn't ask you
to do a thing like that.

11:27.387 --> 11:30.188
Believe me, we millionaires
have to stick together.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.824
Why didn't you tell me that
you were in such bad shape?

11:32.892 --> 11:34.725
I'm not in bad shape.
I'm just a little tired.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.127
You kept me up
pretty late last night.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.962
Yes. Oh! Yes,
i happen to have it.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.897
This is the corporation
for you.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.867
"Tehachapuku oil
and mining corporation."

11:42.936 --> 11:44.769
My boy, do you know
anything about oil?

11:44.837 --> 11:46.303
No. But I worked in
a gas station once.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.772
That's the American way:

11:47.841 --> 11:50.475
From grease monkey to
president of an oil company.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.611
Just goes to show you
what a man can do
if he has a little drive.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.546
He can do pretty good
if he knows how to putt,
too.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.781
Ah, yes.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.150
Oh! Ow!

11:59.219 --> 12:02.420
You oil men have such
a wonderful sense of humor.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.088
Now if you'll--
that smarts--

12:04.157 --> 12:07.091
you just sign
right here.
There you are.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.792
Do you think I ought
to do this, Mr. howell?

12:08.861 --> 12:10.261
Believe me, it's
the only solution.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.829
At least the only one
i can come up with.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.531
That's all there is
to it?

12:13.599 --> 12:17.902
That's all.
Simple transfer--oh,
you can have the pen.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.538
I can't find that--

12:20.607 --> 12:22.039
oh, here you are.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.340
Uh, yes,
i just stopped by

12:23.409 --> 12:25.343
to settle my debt
with, uh, gilligan.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.979
Fine, Mr. howell.
I hope you'll accept
my apology.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.515
Apology?
Apology for what?

12:30.584 --> 12:33.151
For all the things
i said about you while
i was looking for you.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.552
Ha ha ha!

12:34.620 --> 12:37.055
[Both laughing]

12:37.124 --> 12:38.623
Well, I guess we better
put Mr. howell's check
in a safe place,

12:38.691 --> 12:39.757
eh, gilligan?

12:39.826 --> 12:40.925
Yes, I've already
done that.

12:40.993 --> 12:42.660
It's right here
in my pocket.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.996
Mr. howell's saving me
from getting stuck
with $3 million.

12:45.065 --> 12:45.796
What?

12:45.865 --> 12:46.764
Instead of
giving me money

12:46.833 --> 12:48.666
he gave me
an oil company.

12:48.735 --> 12:50.401
Why do you want
an oil company?

12:50.470 --> 12:52.837
Mr. howell
can explain it
better than me.

12:52.906 --> 12:53.971
Yes, howell.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.873
Start explaining.

12:55.942 --> 13:00.044
Well, you see, I settled
the debt by giving gilligan
one of my oil companies.

13:00.112 --> 13:03.881
Yeah, I'm president
of the tehachapuku oil
and mining corporation.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.417
Tehachapuku
oil and mining?

13:06.486 --> 13:07.251
What is that?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.019
Well, that's
200 acres of land

13:09.088 --> 13:11.889
in, uh, dustbowl, Oklahoma.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.091
Dustbowl?
I never heard of it.

13:13.159 --> 13:14.893
What part of Oklahoma
is that in?

13:14.961 --> 13:17.295
Well, sometimes it's north,
and sometimes it's south.

13:17.364 --> 13:21.232
It depends on which way
the wind is blowing.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.868
In other words, gilligan
here is the proud owner

13:23.937 --> 13:25.503
of a worthless oil company.

13:25.572 --> 13:26.704
What do you mean,
worthless?

13:26.773 --> 13:29.273
I got $3 million
for it.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.408
Hah!

13:34.380 --> 13:36.480
I guess I didn't do
such a smart thing, huh?

13:36.549 --> 13:37.715
I'm afraid not.

13:37.783 --> 13:38.849
What's our next move?

13:38.918 --> 13:40.017
<i> Your</i> next move

13:40.086 --> 13:41.552
is to get out of my chair,
gilligan.

13:41.621 --> 13:42.620
Okay,<i> dad.</i>

13:42.689 --> 13:44.422
Skipper, gilligan.
Skipper.

13:50.897 --> 13:52.430
Gilligan, hurry up
with that coffee.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.531
Coming right up,
skipper.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.832
Pass me those
mango preserves

13:54.901 --> 13:56.066
will you,
lovey, my dear?

13:56.135 --> 13:56.901
They're full of
vitamins, darling.

13:56.969 --> 13:58.569
Thank you.

13:58.638 --> 14:01.539
Really, Mr. howell,
i think you big businessmen
are terrible.

14:01.608 --> 14:04.508
How can you eat a thing
after what you've done
to poor gilligan?

14:04.577 --> 14:08.012
The lion always gorges
itself after the kill.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.547
It's the nature
of the beast.

14:09.615 --> 14:11.816
Well, I still say
it was a dirty trick.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.417
Kid wakes up
this morning,
he's a millionaire.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.653
Look at him now:
He's waiting on table.

14:15.722 --> 14:16.854
Yes, you really
ought to be

14:16.923 --> 14:18.155
ashamed of yourself,
Mr. howell.

14:18.224 --> 14:19.823
Well, don't blame me.
I can't help it

14:19.892 --> 14:22.794
if the kid
squandered his fortune
on bad investments.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.595
Yes, but you're the one
that sold it to him.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.732
I'm not known as the wizard
of wall street for nothing.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.702
Nobody gets the better
of thurston
in a business deal.

14:30.770 --> 14:31.869
When it comes
to making money

14:31.937 --> 14:33.470
he seems to have
a green thumb.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.105
Alright, Mr. howell,
you're such
a Wheeler-dealer

14:35.174 --> 14:36.840
how come you bought
that phony oil property?

14:36.909 --> 14:38.108
I <i> didn't</i> buy it.

14:38.177 --> 14:40.511
It was a wedding gift
from lovey's father.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.448
Oh, thurston, you know
how embarrassed
daddy was

14:43.516 --> 14:47.451
when he found out what
dustbowl, Oklahoma,
really was.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.421
He thought he'd given us
a football stadium.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.889
Mr. howell:
After the wedding.

14:51.957 --> 14:53.957
Ooh! Oh, I almost forgot.

14:54.026 --> 14:56.994
It's time for the 10:00
wall street news.

14:57.063 --> 15:00.364
Newsman: And industrials
are up 1.2 over
yesterday's close.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.132
Now for the big news
on wall street today.

15:02.201 --> 15:04.035
Thurston howell
has done it again!

15:04.103 --> 15:05.669
Well, good for him.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.670
Wait a minute,
that's me.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.139
What have I done?

15:08.208 --> 15:10.107
A huge oil strike
has been reported

15:10.176 --> 15:11.675
in the howell holdings
in dustbowl, Oklahoma.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.345
Reports from the scene
indicate this could be

15:14.413 --> 15:16.514
the richest oil field
ever found in the state.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.150
However, as black gold gushes
into the Oklahoma sky,

15:19.219 --> 15:21.185
everyone is asking
the same question:

15:21.254 --> 15:25.556
Where is the man who owns
the fabulous tehachapuku
oil and mining company?

15:25.625 --> 15:27.591
[Click]
I'll tell you
where he is.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.628
He's right here having
a nice breakfast
with his dad.

15:30.697 --> 15:34.432
Move over and
make a little room
for my boy, howell!

15:51.851 --> 15:52.616
Hello, son.

15:52.685 --> 15:53.784
Hi, skipper.

15:53.853 --> 15:54.785
Uh-uh-uh.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.720
Oh, I mean,
hi, dad.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.523
And what's my boy
doing there?

15:58.591 --> 16:00.558
Well, it's sort of
a surprise.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.826
What kind
of surprise?

16:01.894 --> 16:03.561
Everybody's
been so nice to me

16:03.630 --> 16:05.162
I thought I'd take
some of my money
and buy 'em a present.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.264
That's very nice
of you, gilligan.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.267
Well, the professor likes
to experiment with stuff

16:09.335 --> 16:12.169
so I thought I'd get him
a science laboratory.

16:12.238 --> 16:13.938
A science laboratory?

16:14.007 --> 16:15.206
Yeah, I was gonna
buy him a tie

16:15.274 --> 16:16.908
but I don't know
if wears one.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.576
And I want to get
Mary Ann the biggest
farm in Kansas.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.878
Hold it,
those are pretty
expensive gifts.

16:20.946 --> 16:23.348
What good is money if
you can't do something
nice for your friends?

16:23.416 --> 16:25.182
But you don't have to
spend a fortune doing it.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.517
Real friends don't care.

16:26.585 --> 16:30.454
It's not the gift that counts,
it's the thought.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.524
By the way, had you
thought about what
you're going to get me?

16:33.593 --> 16:36.294
Sure have. You get
the best present
of them all.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.030
Oh, gilligan.
I don't want you to spend
a lot of money on me.

16:39.099 --> 16:39.864
You don't?

16:39.932 --> 16:41.165
No, sir.
Oh.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.534
Oh, but of course,
if you've already gotten it,

16:43.603 --> 16:46.637
I wouldn't want
to take it back.
What did you get me?

16:46.706 --> 16:48.506
I can't tell.
It's kind of
a surprise.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.407
Aw, come on,
gilligan.
No.

16:50.476 --> 16:51.909
Not even
a little hint?
No.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.344
Gilligan,
what did you get me?

16:53.413 --> 16:54.311
A boat.
A boat!

16:54.380 --> 16:55.746
A boat!
A boat.

16:55.814 --> 16:57.314
You shouldn't have.

16:57.383 --> 16:58.649
Well, I haven't yet.

16:58.718 --> 16:59.584
But you're gonna.

16:59.652 --> 17:00.951
You bet I am.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.253
What kind of a boat
are you gonna get me?

17:02.321 --> 17:03.988
I don't know, skipper.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.690
How about one like
the old <i> minnow?</i>

17:05.759 --> 17:07.592
What would I want
with an old tub like that?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.426
You can have any kind
of boat you want.

17:09.496 --> 17:10.928
And I'm gonna get you
lots of other presents,
too.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.529
Gilligan, I don't
know what to say.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.333
I better get out of
here before I start
bawling like a baby.

17:15.401 --> 17:16.633
Are you alright,
skipper?

17:16.702 --> 17:17.800
It's just that I'm
a little choked up.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.237
I better go with you,
huh?

17:19.305 --> 17:21.538
No, you stay right here
and finish that list.

17:21.607 --> 17:23.207
And another thing,
gilligan--

17:23.276 --> 17:24.374
I don't want those other
vultures coming in here

17:24.443 --> 17:25.476
and taking advantage
of you.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.977
So keep this door
locked.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.011
We don't have a lock.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.480
That's right.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.816
Well, don't let anybody
in this hut, understand?

17:31.885 --> 17:33.517
Yes, sir.
And that's an order.

17:33.586 --> 17:34.318
Aye, aye, skipper.

17:35.721 --> 17:36.788
Son.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.391
I think
I'll buy Mary Ann

17:40.460 --> 17:43.394
the whole state
of Kansas.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.139
Anybody home,
gilligan?

17:56.842 --> 17:59.076
"S.S. Minnow."

17:59.145 --> 18:00.945
What's the matter?

18:01.014 --> 18:02.313
New dress?

18:02.382 --> 18:05.416
Like it? I made it
out of your duffel bag.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.451
I hope you don't mind.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.454
No. My duffel
never looked so good.

18:10.522 --> 18:13.657
Skipper said
nobody could come in here
while he was gone.

18:13.726 --> 18:16.126
Well, I just wanted
to talk to you.

18:16.195 --> 18:17.561
Oh. Well,
let's go out there.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.196
Okay.

18:19.265 --> 18:22.166
I know how busy you are
with your oil Wells
and everything

18:22.234 --> 18:24.068
but I just wanted
to tell you

18:24.136 --> 18:25.836
how proud I am of you.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.571
Oh, I'm not busy.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.306
I think it's
absolutely thrilling

18:29.375 --> 18:30.774
the way you outsmarted
Mr. howell.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.110
It was?

18:32.178 --> 18:35.412
Yes. I never dreamed
you were so clever.

18:35.481 --> 18:37.281
Neither did I.
What did I do?

18:37.349 --> 18:38.649
You're so modest, too.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.350
Everyone knows
that that land

18:40.419 --> 18:41.852
wasn't worth a cent

18:41.921 --> 18:44.254
until you took it over.

18:44.323 --> 18:48.759
You're a very remarkable
man, gilligan.

18:48.828 --> 18:49.827
Yeah?

18:49.896 --> 18:51.629
Yeah.

18:56.002 --> 18:59.003
I think that
your life story

18:59.071 --> 19:01.438
would make
a wonderful movie
for some studio.

19:01.507 --> 19:03.808
What studio would make
a movie about me?

19:03.876 --> 19:05.109
Any studio you owned.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.143
And you know what?

19:06.212 --> 19:07.611
What?

19:07.680 --> 19:09.647
I'd just love
to star in it.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.648
But you don't look
a thing like me.

19:11.717 --> 19:14.451
No, silly.
We'd get rock Hudson
to play you.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.454
I'd play your wife.

19:21.226 --> 19:22.759
But I'm not even married.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.930
Well, you would be
if you looked like
rock Hudson.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.599
There you are, gilligan.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.468
Please forgive me
for a moment,
will you, ginger?

19:30.537 --> 19:33.771
I just want
to steal a little
of gilligan's time.

19:35.741 --> 19:37.208
I know what
you want to steal, howell

19:37.276 --> 19:38.776
and you're not going
to get away with it.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.445
Well, I was merely
inviting gilligan
to dinner.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.114
Oh, well, fine.
We'd be glad to come.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.449
You'll be there,
too?

19:45.517 --> 19:46.617
I think I'd better be.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.052
Fine, fine.
Glad you can come.

19:49.121 --> 19:51.122
I thought you were
standing watch duty
tonight.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.890
Oh, I am, Mr. howell.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.825
In fact, I'm going
to stand guard duty

19:54.893 --> 19:57.962
until I can get gilligan
off this island.

20:02.502 --> 20:05.436
It's so nice
that you could come.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.838
We're delighted to have you.

20:07.906 --> 20:10.441
I'll have dinner ready
in a few minutes.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.977
I'm just finishing
the bananas.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.445
Alright,
lovey, my dear.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.147
Take all the time
that you want.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.416
Oh, gilligan,
would you take
a chair, please?

20:19.485 --> 20:20.617
And captain,
how's this chair

20:20.686 --> 20:23.955
for a man of your,
rather, shall we say..

20:25.657 --> 20:27.991
Are you both comfortable
in that chair?

20:28.060 --> 20:30.460
No, but we're safe.

20:30.529 --> 20:31.796
Say, that was some news

20:31.864 --> 20:34.131
we heard this afternoon
on the radio, wasn't it?

20:34.200 --> 20:35.232
It sure was.

20:35.301 --> 20:36.466
Well, gilligan, my boy,

20:36.535 --> 20:38.035
how does it feel
to be in the oil business?

20:38.104 --> 20:39.003
Well--

20:39.071 --> 20:40.371
how does it feel

20:40.440 --> 20:42.239
to be out of the oil
business, Mr. howell?

20:42.308 --> 20:44.241
I must say,
the joke is on me.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.277
Mrs. howell and i
laughed all afternoon.

20:46.345 --> 20:48.245
Ha ha ha ha. I'll bet.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.346
How much?

20:49.415 --> 20:50.714
Purely a figure
of speech.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.449
Surely you're
a man of the world, captain.

20:52.518 --> 20:54.151
You see nothing wrong

20:54.219 --> 20:56.253
with, shall we say,
a game of chance?

20:56.322 --> 20:57.855
It all depends on
what the game is.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.156
What kind would you like?

20:59.225 --> 21:01.926
Cards? Dice? Roulette?

21:01.995 --> 21:03.728
Not interested, Mr. howell.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.196
There's only one game
that I ever gamble on,
and that's pool.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.430
Pool?

21:07.499 --> 21:08.932
Now, were you
to have a pool table

21:09.001 --> 21:11.335
I might be interested
in placing a bet with you.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.042
Shall we...

21:19.311 --> 21:20.778
Lag for break?

21:22.782 --> 21:25.049
9 in that pocket,
10 over here

21:25.117 --> 21:27.017
and the 11
the hard way in there.

21:27.086 --> 21:30.054
Let's see. I'll do it
banking off...Off the...

21:37.463 --> 21:38.763
Gilligan!

21:43.136 --> 21:45.736
The 11 in the far pocket,
the 2 over there

21:45.805 --> 21:46.971
the 3 up there

21:47.040 --> 21:49.307
and the 7
in the pocket right here.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.220
13 and 10 in this pocket,
the 2 in the side pocket

22:03.289 --> 22:05.589
the 9 and 14 up here,
respectively

22:05.657 --> 22:08.125
the 8 in that pocket,
the 11 in there

22:08.193 --> 22:10.027
and the little 4 ball
down here

22:10.096 --> 22:13.664
in what I call a difficult
but delightful shot.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.146
Thurston,
when are you men
going to eat?

22:29.214 --> 22:31.115
Just one more game,
Mrs. howell?

22:31.183 --> 22:33.617
But your breakfast
is getting stone cold.

22:36.789 --> 22:38.155
Rack 'em up again,
howell.

22:38.224 --> 22:40.357
Why don't we settle up
before we start another game.

22:40.426 --> 22:41.658
Settle up?
What for?

22:41.727 --> 22:43.160
You owe me quite a lot.

22:43.229 --> 22:44.428
I beg your pardon.

22:44.496 --> 22:45.662
Do I look like
the type of man

22:45.731 --> 22:47.464
who'd run out on
a $12 million bet?

22:47.533 --> 22:48.899
As a matter of fact, you do.

22:48.968 --> 22:52.302
However, if gilligan
will just sign this note.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.303
What kind of note?

22:53.372 --> 22:55.071
Well, it's just a note.

22:55.140 --> 22:57.641
You just sign
right there at the bottom,
gilligan, my boy.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.910
"I owe you
$12 million
payable on demand."

22:59.979 --> 23:01.946
Just sign at the bottom.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.847
Don't worry, gilligan.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.749
I'll win it back for you
the first chance I get
to shoot.

23:05.818 --> 23:08.352
I know you will,
skipper.

23:08.420 --> 23:09.453
Keep the pen.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.788
Rack 'em up again,
howell.

23:10.856 --> 23:12.756
I think his luck
is just about to change.

23:12.825 --> 23:15.392
It already has.
I want my 12 million now.

23:15.461 --> 23:18.094
Now? He just signed
a note for you.

23:18.163 --> 23:20.798
Well, the note says
payable on demand,
and I demand payment.

23:20.866 --> 23:22.266
But I don't have
that much money.

23:22.335 --> 23:24.368
Well, certainly
you have something
worth $12 million.

23:24.436 --> 23:26.904
Watch, cuff links...
Oil company?

23:26.973 --> 23:29.273
Oh, yeah. I forgot.
My oil company.

23:29.341 --> 23:32.143
No, no, no.
It's <i> my</i> oil company.

23:32.211 --> 23:33.911
Ha ha! Ha ha!

23:33.979 --> 23:36.881
The wizard of wall street
strikes again!

23:46.258 --> 23:47.691
Hello, skipper.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.959
I hear you had dinner
with the howells last night.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.460
Yes, a catered
Chuck wagon affair--

23:50.529 --> 23:52.595
all you could eat
for $12 million.

23:52.664 --> 23:54.731
All you could eat
for $12 million.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.400
That's a pretty funny one,
isn't it, skipper?

23:56.469 --> 23:58.268
Ha ha ha ha.
Sit down, gilligan.

23:58.337 --> 24:01.838
Oh, goodness.
It's time for the 12:00
stock market report.

24:01.907 --> 24:02.940
Oh!

24:06.111 --> 24:08.545
Newsman: And rails
held steady at the close.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.614
Of course, the street
is still talking about

24:10.683 --> 24:12.550
the latest news
out of dustbowl, Oklahoma.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.284
What news?

24:14.353 --> 24:16.186
Newsman:
Further investigation
by the howell corporation

24:16.255 --> 24:18.121
has revealed the true source
of the gusher.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.357
Their drill had punctured
the tank of an oil truck

24:20.426 --> 24:23.327
which had been buried
during one of the frequent
dust storms in that area.

24:23.395 --> 24:25.929
Tehachapuku oil and mining
stock is worthless.

24:25.997 --> 24:27.631
Meanwhile,
the search continues

24:27.700 --> 24:29.866
for the owner
of this desolate wasteland.

24:29.935 --> 24:34.204
Once again we ask,
where is thurston howell?

24:34.272 --> 24:35.072
I'll tell you where he is.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.774
He's right down there.

24:52.391 --> 24:53.858
¶ Now this is the tale
of our castaways ¶

24:53.926 --> 24:55.725
¶ they're here
for a long, long time ¶

24:55.794 --> 24:58.295
¶ they'll have to make
the best of things ¶

24:58.364 --> 25:00.364
¶ it's an uphill climb ¶

25:00.432 --> 25:02.432
¶ the first mate
and his skipper, too ¶

25:02.501 --> 25:04.568
¶ will do their very best ¶

25:04.636 --> 25:06.737
¶ to make the others
comfortable ¶

25:06.806 --> 25:08.505
¶ in their tropic
island nest ¶

25:08.574 --> 25:10.107
¶ no phones, no lights ¶

25:10.175 --> 25:11.207
¶ no motorcars ¶

25:11.276 --> 25:12.742
¶ not a single luxury ¶

25:12.811 --> 25:15.445
¶ like Robinson crusoe ¶

25:15.514 --> 25:17.348
¶ it's primitive as can be ¶

25:17.416 --> 25:19.917
¶ so join us here
each week, my friends ¶

25:19.986 --> 25:21.918
¶ you're sure
to get a smile ¶

25:21.987 --> 25:24.054
¶ for 7 stranded
castaways ¶

25:24.123 --> 25:26.156
¶ here on
gilligan's isle ¶
