03:53.715 --> 03:56.066
I'll see you.

03:56.718 --> 03:58.568
Okay.

04:14.136 --> 04:17.488
Good job, you guys.
See you all back at the house.

04:49.638 --> 04:54.243
So he says to me, "I'd just soon they
cut the state off just north of Orlando...

04:54.343 --> 04:57.112
and let the bottom half
float right out into the gulf."

04:57.212 --> 05:00.916
It didn't sound like such a bad idea.

05:01.016 --> 05:03.285
Fair enough on the bakery grade.

05:03.385 --> 05:05.521
I want 92 for the tupelo.

05:05.621 --> 05:08.223
- Ulee.
- I could sell it myself.

05:08.323 --> 05:11.300
Fact is, I've been thinking
of doing just that.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.495
Can you extract by next Thursday?

05:13.595 --> 05:16.031
I can give you 30 barrels.
I'll keep the rest.

05:16.131 --> 05:19.176
You're not working
as many bees these days.

05:19.711 --> 05:23.564
- Can you deliver?
- I said 30. I meant it.

05:24.272 --> 05:28.043
Well, it's gonna be a good year.

05:28.143 --> 05:31.079
At least as long as they can keep
the Chinese from dumping their honey.

05:31.179 --> 05:33.482
Chinese don't have anything
like our tupelo.

05:33.582 --> 05:36.152
Ulee, most folks
don't seem to care anymore.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.554
Cheap honey floods the market.

05:38.654 --> 05:40.856
The bees and I have an understanding.

05:40.956 --> 05:43.492
I take care of them, they take care of me.

05:43.592 --> 05:47.329
We'll both just have to work
a little harder, that's all.

05:47.429 --> 05:48.730
Time to go.

05:48.830 --> 05:50.732
If all my suppliers were like you...

05:50.832 --> 05:54.150
Well, then I would worry
about the competition.

05:57.839 --> 06:01.542
- What do you hear from Jimmy?
- We don't keep in touch.

06:01.975 --> 06:03.916
It's almost two years, ain't it?

06:12.688 --> 06:15.257
Hey, Ulee. Wait up.

06:15.357 --> 06:17.708
I can't do that, Sheriff.

06:26.902 --> 06:30.482
Why, Ulee, it has been a long time.

06:31.306 --> 06:35.177
- Can we go back to the way things were?
- No, Bill, I don't think we can.

06:35.277 --> 06:37.879
Mary's always wanting you over for supper.

06:37.979 --> 06:41.116
Look, you can't stay cut off forever.

06:41.216 --> 06:45.262
It's a busy time, Bill.
Tell Mary thanks for asking though.

07:23.658 --> 07:26.566
Hey, Ulee. How you been?

07:27.362 --> 07:29.665
Fine, Penny. How are you doing?

07:29.765 --> 07:31.733
Just fine.

07:31.833 --> 07:34.069
What you got there?

07:34.169 --> 07:36.538
It's a bunny for Easter.

07:36.638 --> 07:38.473
Don't look like much.

07:38.573 --> 07:41.925
Of course it ain't, Gramps.
It's just pretend.

08:00.929 --> 08:03.999
- Off to work again, Connie?
- Afraid so, Penny.

08:04.099 --> 08:06.668
- How was your math test?
- I got an 85.

08:06.768 --> 08:10.539
That's good. Did you get
the rent check, Mr. Jackson?

08:10.639 --> 08:13.642
Yes, I certainly did, Miss Hope.
Is everything okay with the house?

08:13.742 --> 08:16.111
Everything's fine.

08:16.211 --> 08:18.562
- Take care.
- Bye.

08:25.120 --> 08:28.023
I'm glad Connie's our new renter.
Aren't you, Ulee?

08:28.123 --> 08:30.459
I like her lots better
than old Mrs. Pritchard.

08:30.559 --> 08:32.693
Well, we hardly know her, Penny.

08:32.794 --> 08:35.263
It takes more than a couple
of months to know someone.

08:35.363 --> 08:38.133
But she's a nurse, Ulee.
All nurses are nice.

08:38.232 --> 08:42.086
- Is that right?
- Come on, Buckshot. Come on.

08:57.652 --> 08:59.488
Casey.

08:59.588 --> 09:01.597
In here.

09:05.760 --> 09:08.509
- Y'all have a good day?
- Not bad.

09:09.264 --> 09:11.566
Aren't you starting all this
a little early?

09:11.666 --> 09:14.669
It's Friday. I already asked you
about tonight. You said it was okay.

09:14.769 --> 09:16.949
I know what I said.

09:19.274 --> 09:22.387
- Is it that Mitchell kid?
- That's right.

09:23.211 --> 09:26.448
- Where are you going?
- A movie. Where else?

09:26.548 --> 09:28.899
That's all, you hear.

09:29.818 --> 09:31.085
To tell you the truth...

09:31.185 --> 09:34.848
we were kind of thinking of going to
Mexico and robbing a couple of banks.

09:34.948 --> 09:37.993
After all, it runs in the blood.

09:38.193 --> 09:40.695
Shouldn't be any trouble at all
going wild.

09:40.795 --> 09:43.165
Don't even kid about it.

09:43.265 --> 09:45.513
Buckshot?

09:57.045 --> 09:59.589
I gotta pay the guys.

10:23.538 --> 10:25.674
- Thank you, Charley.
- Thanks, Mr. Jackson.

10:25.774 --> 10:28.785
- You boys did good.
- Thank you.

10:31.746 --> 10:35.317
A couple of us were wondering if we can
stay on through extracting and the move.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.319
Thanks, but I don't think so.

10:37.419 --> 10:40.922
But it's mighty hard work, sir.
I mean, especially a man your age.

10:41.022 --> 10:44.326
- Couldn't you use some help?
- I've gotten used to going it alone.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.435
Thanks anyway. Maybe next year.

10:46.795 --> 10:49.806
Yes, sir. I just thought I'd ask.

11:13.054 --> 11:15.405
You be home by 11:30.

11:16.257 --> 11:19.427
- We'll try.
- No tryin' to it.

11:19.527 --> 11:21.377
Be here.

11:22.931 --> 11:24.833
Yeah?

11:24.933 --> 11:27.944
And you just try to figure out
a way to make me.

11:36.144 --> 11:38.613
You'll pay the rest of your life
for being a jackass.

11:38.713 --> 11:42.224
Yeah? Anything'd be better
than dying of boredom.

11:45.286 --> 11:48.137
Let's get the fuck out of here, Markie.

12:50.351 --> 12:52.787
You're supposed to be
getting ready for bed.

12:52.887 --> 12:56.796
It's Friday night, Ulee.
I can stay up a little bit.

13:34.462 --> 13:38.076
And they're all dead? Every last one?

13:39.534 --> 13:42.904
Except for you. All dead?

13:43.004 --> 13:45.389
That's right.

13:50.445 --> 13:52.625
Had they been bad?

13:53.448 --> 13:56.800
- Did they deserve to die?
- No.

13:58.753 --> 14:01.297
No, Penny, they did not.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.805
Why then?

14:09.030 --> 14:11.381
Those were good guys.

14:12.767 --> 14:15.870
Your grandpa was tricky.

14:15.970 --> 14:19.879
Lucky. That's why I made it out.

14:21.943 --> 14:24.954
Maybe only the tricky made it out.

14:26.614 --> 14:29.217
And I shouldn't be talking
to a little kid...

14:29.317 --> 14:33.254
about terrible stuff that happened
a long time before she was born.

14:33.354 --> 14:36.399
But it's so sad, Ulee.

14:36.925 --> 14:38.639
You like sad?

14:40.228 --> 14:42.997
But sometimes, inside...

14:43.097 --> 14:46.005
it makes you quiet.

15:16.764 --> 15:18.800
Hello, Dad?

15:18.900 --> 15:21.035
Jimmy.

15:21.135 --> 15:23.486
I need to see you.

15:24.906 --> 15:28.543
Next week, maybe.
We just brought in the tupelo.

15:28.643 --> 15:32.393
That could be too late. It's Helen.

15:32.814 --> 15:35.165
Helen's in trouble.

15:37.585 --> 15:39.554
I could care less, and you know it.

15:39.654 --> 15:42.437
Please, Dad, this is different.

15:44.392 --> 15:47.662
- Hours still 10:00 to 1:00?
- That's right.

15:47.762 --> 15:49.664
I'll be there at noon.

15:49.764 --> 15:53.617
- How are the kids?
- Fine. Great.

15:54.602 --> 15:56.771
What the hell do you think?

15:56.871 --> 15:59.950
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

16:03.544 --> 16:05.053
Who was that?

16:06.748 --> 16:09.584
Man wants to sell me some hives.

16:09.684 --> 16:11.586
I guess I'll go give them a look-see.

16:11.686 --> 16:14.697
You go and brush your teeth.

16:15.390 --> 16:18.139
I'll be in and read you good night.

16:51.359 --> 16:53.266
Good night.

17:06.941 --> 17:10.979
Your daddy called tonight.
Something's come up.

17:11.079 --> 17:12.929
Is he getting out?

17:15.183 --> 17:19.900
I have to go see him tomorrow.
You'll need to take care of Penny.

17:20.355 --> 17:22.457
- I'll be home before supper.
- Get somebody else.

17:22.557 --> 17:25.526
Like Connie Hope next door.
I got things to do.

17:25.626 --> 17:28.773
We don't ask outsiders for help,
Casey. You know that.

17:29.731 --> 17:31.766
Yeah, well, just tell my dad...

17:31.866 --> 17:35.218
he might answer some
of my letters sometime.

19:05.460 --> 19:08.209
Casey would like to hear from you.

19:09.597 --> 19:11.733
She claims you've been
giving her a hard time.

19:11.833 --> 19:13.901
Just trying to keep a lid on her hormones.

19:14.001 --> 19:18.184
At this rate, she'll be starting a baby
even before you and Helen did.

19:19.507 --> 19:22.310
One round of fools is enough,
don't you think?

19:22.410 --> 19:25.513
Helen is in Orlando.

19:25.613 --> 19:27.615
She's been working
as a waitress or something.

19:27.715 --> 19:32.100
Next time you talk to her, ask her
to send something home to her kids.

19:32.687 --> 19:35.334
She hasn't been in touch.

19:36.357 --> 19:38.393
Remember Eddie Flowers and Ferris Dooley?

19:38.493 --> 19:42.869
- They still robbing mini-marts?
- Eddie called yesterday.

19:43.364 --> 19:45.900
They were in a bar down
in the trail two nights ago.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.069
She stumbles in, strung out on something.

19:48.169 --> 19:50.438
She's acting so crazy,
someone's gonna call the cops.

19:50.538 --> 19:53.241
So somehow Eddie and Ferris managed
to get her out and took her home.

19:53.341 --> 19:56.444
I wouldn't trust those two bastards
any further than I could spit.

19:56.544 --> 19:57.612
Neither would I.

19:57.712 --> 20:01.549
That's why you gotta go get her
right now, while we know where she is...

20:01.649 --> 20:04.500
- before Eddie or Ferris do something.
- Get her?

20:05.353 --> 20:07.822
And then what?

20:07.922 --> 20:11.626
She left her kids, your kids. Remember?

20:11.726 --> 20:13.628
This is my busiest time.

20:13.728 --> 20:17.546
I'm supposed to risk everything
to go bring back a god...

20:18.366 --> 20:21.308
As far as I'm concerned,
she can just stay gone.

20:22.270 --> 20:24.416
She's sick, Dad.

20:28.509 --> 20:32.225
I don't know nothing about dealing
with scum like Eddie and Ferris.

20:34.115 --> 20:35.283
Besides...

20:35.383 --> 20:38.986
you think she's gonna
let me go in there...

20:39.086 --> 20:41.437
take her off just like that?

20:43.558 --> 20:46.500
You're all we got, Pop.

20:53.601 --> 20:56.537
- How you doing?
- Where are you?

20:56.637 --> 20:59.841
Casey, you're gonna have to take care
of things for a while longer.

20:59.941 --> 21:02.743
There's food there. Get Penny to help.

21:02.843 --> 21:06.614
I've been taking care of her all day.
I'm about ready to kill the creep.

21:06.714 --> 21:09.497
Tell her everything's okay.

21:10.651 --> 21:13.002
And, Casey...

21:14.555 --> 21:17.065
I may be bringing your mom home.

21:18.993 --> 21:21.863
- Why bother?
- That was my feeling exactly.

21:21.963 --> 21:24.314
But your dad...

21:25.266 --> 21:26.968
Your dad's real worried about her.

21:27.068 --> 21:29.003
How is he?

21:29.103 --> 21:31.454
Okay, I guess.

21:32.440 --> 21:33.508
Where are you now?

21:33.608 --> 21:35.676
Outside Orlando.

21:35.776 --> 21:38.112
I've only got a phone number.

21:38.212 --> 21:41.757
So far I haven't been able to get through.

21:42.783 --> 21:44.685
It's typical.

21:44.785 --> 21:46.635
Yeah.

21:48.322 --> 21:50.525
You all take care of yourself, okay?

21:50.625 --> 21:52.527
Yeah, no sweat.

21:52.627 --> 21:54.978
See you tomorrow.

23:12.973 --> 23:14.375
Speak to me.

23:14.475 --> 23:18.328
I'm trying to reach Eddie Flowers
or Ferris Dooley.

23:19.155 --> 23:20.995
Mr. Jackson.

23:22.149 --> 23:24.051
When do you want to get together?

23:24.151 --> 23:26.502
The sooner, the better.

23:27.188 --> 23:30.540
Meet us at the Orange Blossom
on the trail in an hour.

23:30.925 --> 23:33.936
We'll be shooting pool in back.

24:36.323 --> 24:39.493
Nice to see you again, Mr. Jackson.
It's been a while.

24:39.593 --> 24:41.944
Not long enough, Eddie.

24:43.597 --> 24:46.778
I guess some things can't be helped.

25:27.141 --> 25:30.177
Ferris has been sleeping
on the floor in here, Mr. Jackson.

25:30.277 --> 25:33.254
It's not the most comfortable
situation, right?

25:58.606 --> 26:01.041
She was walking in her sleep.

26:01.141 --> 26:03.958
We had to tie her up sometimes.

26:21.561 --> 26:25.566
Yes, sir, it's booming down here,
with that mouse and all.

26:25.666 --> 26:28.068
This is where all those
smart guys are setting up.

26:28.168 --> 26:29.970
Yeah?

26:30.070 --> 26:32.640
You wouldn't believe the opportunities.

26:32.740 --> 26:35.843
Ferris and me? Man, we got it made.

26:35.943 --> 26:39.346
- Too bad Jimmy can't be here with us.
- What's she on?

26:39.446 --> 26:42.183
- What?
- What's she on?

26:42.283 --> 26:44.133
Oh.

26:45.386 --> 26:48.055
Well, down here they call them rufies.

26:48.155 --> 26:50.391
When you mix them
with a beer or two, God knows...

26:50.491 --> 26:54.361
you can go wild and crazy and
not remember a thing in the morning.

26:54.461 --> 26:57.244
That ain't for me. No way.

27:03.602 --> 27:04.939
Where's she been staying?

27:05.039 --> 27:08.948
We ran into her, she was working
at a Waffle House a couple weeks ago.

27:09.777 --> 27:12.780
Something bad had happened.
I think she split up with some guy.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.782
She asked us to look out for her.

27:14.882 --> 27:17.767
Thought you met her
just a couple of days ago.

27:19.599 --> 27:20.799
No.

27:21.055 --> 27:23.858
I told Jimmy she surprised us then.

27:23.958 --> 27:28.028
You know, when she showed up like that,
all messed up at the bar, I mean.

27:28.128 --> 27:29.978
Cream?

27:32.166 --> 27:34.235
I suppose you had to keep her drugged.

27:34.335 --> 27:37.738
Well, we didn't know how to stop her.

27:37.838 --> 27:41.508
Most folks would've
just called the police.

27:41.608 --> 27:45.622
- Jimmy's lucky to have good friends.
- Yeah, that's right.

27:46.413 --> 27:49.817
But she's too much for us, Mr. Jackson.

27:49.917 --> 27:53.701
- That's why we had to call Jimmy.
- Yeah.

27:55.255 --> 27:57.958
That and something else.

27:58.058 --> 28:00.602
What does that mean?

28:01.462 --> 28:05.566
There are some things you don't
want to discuss on the phone.

28:05.666 --> 28:08.950
You know, especially to somebody in jail.

28:10.270 --> 28:14.239
Why don't you go there then
and talk to Jimmy personal?

28:16.377 --> 28:19.713
Well, me and Ferris, you know,
we seem pretty blessed with luck...

28:19.813 --> 28:22.182
as far as the law is concerned, but...

28:22.282 --> 28:25.486
we're not gonna do something
as dumb as actually go inside...

28:25.586 --> 28:28.856
where folks could check us out and such.

28:28.956 --> 28:30.090
So?

28:30.190 --> 28:34.461
So, telling someone
that his wife is sick...

28:34.561 --> 28:37.197
Well, that's safe enough on the phone.

28:37.297 --> 28:39.199
You know, that brings a messenger...

28:39.299 --> 28:43.537
someone who can deliver
more special, private information.

28:43.637 --> 28:46.006
Don't get me and Ferris
wrong here, Mr. Jackson.

28:46.106 --> 28:48.542
We're real glad
to have found Helen here...

28:48.642 --> 28:52.426
and to be a part of getting her
to her home and her kin.

28:53.147 --> 28:56.005
Yeah, she's a sweet piece of ass...

28:56.105 --> 28:58.263
even if she is a mother.

28:58.363 --> 29:00.820
Shut up, Ferris.

29:02.556 --> 29:05.893
This goes back to that last job
the three of us did together.

29:05.993 --> 29:11.343
Now, the laws claim that there
was an extra shipment, 100 grand.

29:11.443 --> 29:14.635
You might remember that Jimmy said
he knew nothing about it.

29:14.735 --> 29:16.904
Well, we believed him.

29:17.004 --> 29:20.708
We figured the laws were just setting up
some sort of insurance scam.

29:20.808 --> 29:25.459
Ancient history, Eddie.
You should get on with your life.

29:28.916 --> 29:31.267
You tell Jimmy...

29:31.952 --> 29:35.289
that a little bird told us otherwise.

29:35.389 --> 29:38.292
Since he's gonna be in there
for a while yet...

29:38.392 --> 29:40.928
we figure we could make
good use of that money.

29:41.028 --> 29:43.097
Invest it and such till he gets out.

29:43.197 --> 29:46.600
I won't have anything to do
with Jimmy's crap, Eddie.

29:46.700 --> 29:49.585
You want to give me Helen, fine.

29:52.806 --> 29:54.308
Eddie, what do we...

29:54.408 --> 29:56.510
Shut up, Ferris.

29:56.610 --> 30:00.280
- I don't think you quite understand.
- Save it, Eddie.

30:00.380 --> 30:03.265
I think I better get going.

30:11.992 --> 30:15.606
Call him off, Eddie.
This isn't helping anything.

30:21.735 --> 30:24.950
Are we listening now, Mr. Jackson?

30:26.106 --> 30:28.855
You want a message delivered.

30:29.510 --> 30:31.952
We want the money.

30:33.881 --> 30:36.517
Helen's gonna take some time.

30:36.617 --> 30:40.231
I've got a lot of work to do
before I get back to Jimmy.

30:40.888 --> 30:43.466
I don't care what you say.

30:45.325 --> 30:47.528
Take a week.

30:47.628 --> 30:50.964
You have that money back here in one week.

30:51.064 --> 30:54.435
You tell Jimmy we don't fancy
going back to "Wewa"...

30:54.535 --> 30:56.010
but we will.

30:57.004 --> 30:59.540
And we'll come after all y'all.

30:59.640 --> 31:02.042
Do you understand?

31:02.142 --> 31:04.459
You bet.

31:17.024 --> 31:19.159
Where are her things?

31:19.259 --> 31:23.397
I got a long drive ahead, and I'd just
as soon do it while she's out of it.

31:23.497 --> 31:26.280
Ferris, grab her other arm.

32:03.704 --> 32:06.240
Tell Jimmy hi for us.

32:06.340 --> 32:08.190
Right.

32:13.580 --> 32:15.988
And the two little girls...

32:19.019 --> 32:21.427
I bet they've grown.

33:58.285 --> 34:00.226
Shoes.

34:06.026 --> 34:08.377
I gotta go.

34:13.900 --> 34:16.469
Where did you put my shoes?

34:16.570 --> 34:20.081
- Helen! Calm down.
- No! What are you looking at?

34:22.976 --> 34:26.213
No! What are you looking at?

34:26.313 --> 34:29.290
- Don't you look at me!
- This is not the place.

34:38.158 --> 34:40.007
Now, Helen.

34:40.793 --> 34:43.145
Damn it, Helen.

34:46.666 --> 34:48.344
Let's get in the house.

34:57.177 --> 35:00.080
- Casey, open the door.
- What for?

35:00.180 --> 35:02.292
I'm not going in there.

35:02.682 --> 35:06.019
- Casey doesn't mean it.
- I'm not going in this fucking house!

35:06.119 --> 35:09.096
Why'd you bring her back?

35:11.625 --> 35:14.394
You're looking great, Mom.
So where you been anyway?

35:14.494 --> 35:15.862
Taking care of things?

35:15.962 --> 35:18.472
Fixing things up like you said you would?

35:19.633 --> 35:22.969
- Get her out of here. She stinks.
- Shut up, Casey, or I'll slap you.

35:23.069 --> 35:25.215
You and who else?

35:46.393 --> 35:50.405
Just hit her, knock her out. It's
the only way you'll get her attention.

35:50.864 --> 35:54.216
You bastard.

36:01.541 --> 36:03.892
- Penny, look...
- Please.

36:16.857 --> 36:18.707
Excuse me.

36:19.459 --> 36:21.901
Penny asked me to come over.

36:31.571 --> 36:33.106
- I should call for help.
- No.

36:33.206 --> 36:35.609
No, we just need some time.

36:35.709 --> 36:37.644
- We should call the paramedics.
- No, please.

36:37.744 --> 36:40.493
Is there anything you can do?

36:44.584 --> 36:46.093
It's okay.

37:02.135 --> 37:05.238
Can you get her...
Hold her while I get... Never mind.

37:05.338 --> 37:07.908
Casey, go to my house...

37:08.008 --> 37:11.019
get the bag in the chair
by my front door, and hurry.

37:12.542 --> 37:14.221
Casey! Go!

37:17.377 --> 37:21.444
Find some sheets,
I need three or four of them.
I'm going to have to restrain her.

37:22.422 --> 37:25.158
Nobody is going to hurt you.

37:25.258 --> 37:26.793
Oh, please.

37:26.893 --> 37:29.162
We have to hold you down
so you won't hurt yourself.

37:29.262 --> 37:33.376
- You don't even know me.
- I'm so sorry.

37:44.578 --> 37:47.347
Put the sheets down. Can you hold her?

37:47.447 --> 37:49.297
Yeah.

37:53.086 --> 37:54.936
Thanks, Casey.

38:00.327 --> 38:02.796
Is this just a bad day,
or is she coming down off something?

38:02.896 --> 38:05.098
Rufies. I don't know what it is.

38:05.198 --> 38:07.300
It's Rohypnol.

38:07.400 --> 38:10.003
Probably some other stuff along the way.

38:10.103 --> 38:11.771
Could be worse.

38:11.871 --> 38:13.540
What is that stuff?
What are you gonna give her?

38:13.640 --> 38:16.753
Something to calm her down.

38:18.445 --> 38:20.796
Hold her still.

38:22.816 --> 38:25.724
It'll just take a few minutes.

38:34.628 --> 38:38.742
Everyone's life you ever touched
is fucked.

38:39.499 --> 38:41.850
You know that, Ulee?

38:43.570 --> 38:45.420
Pop.

39:07.394 --> 39:09.563
What's her name?

39:09.663 --> 39:11.670
Helen.

39:11.831 --> 39:15.115
Helen. She's my daughter-in-law.

39:17.003 --> 39:20.787
- Helen should be in a hospital.
- No.

39:27.280 --> 39:29.449
Then we should try to clean her up.

39:29.549 --> 39:32.085
You got a bowl and a washcloth?

39:32.185 --> 39:34.287
Some plastic sheeting?

39:34.387 --> 39:36.690
I have some bee screening.

39:36.790 --> 39:38.401
That'll do.

39:42.562 --> 39:44.412
Here, I'll...

39:58.912 --> 40:00.146
How was Dad?

40:00.246 --> 40:02.096
Okay.

40:03.149 --> 40:06.626
Worried. I have to go back
and see him in a few days.

40:07.353 --> 40:08.421
Can I come?

40:08.521 --> 40:10.523
It'd be in the middle of the week.

40:10.623 --> 40:13.026
I have to start moving bees
and extracting too.

40:13.126 --> 40:15.629
- Can I come?
- No, Casey, you can't.

40:15.729 --> 40:19.099
Your daddy and I have
some serious talking to do.

40:19.199 --> 40:21.049
Sure you do.

40:24.871 --> 40:26.550
Finish your soup, Penny.

40:38.952 --> 40:40.487
Is Mom gonna be all right?

40:40.587 --> 40:42.938
I hope so.

40:50.964 --> 40:53.366
Would you like some tea or something?

40:53.466 --> 40:56.936
Thanks, no. I'm just gonna head on.

40:57.036 --> 40:59.372
She should rest tonight.

40:59.472 --> 41:02.208
Tomorrow I'll check by
in the morning before work.

41:02.308 --> 41:06.386
Thanks, Miss Hope.
We couldn't have done...

41:06.486 --> 41:09.382
Mr. Jackson, this is something
I know how to do.

41:09.482 --> 41:12.652
Well, I'm sorry you had to hear all that.

41:12.752 --> 41:14.888
Please, you don't need to explain.

41:14.988 --> 41:17.157
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:17.257 --> 41:18.892
Bye, Penny.

41:18.992 --> 41:22.462
"Ice, the terror of captains and crews
of the late fall runs...

41:22.562 --> 41:24.898
had made her a shapeless mass.

41:24.998 --> 41:28.668
The ship wallowed and rolled
and seemed to be out of control.

41:28.768 --> 41:33.073
Then in the darkness ahead,
a star flickered and flashed.

41:33.173 --> 41:35.023
A light..."

41:38.111 --> 41:40.680
Why don't we save the story?

41:40.780 --> 41:42.749
All right, Ulee.

41:42.849 --> 41:45.962
- Good night.
- Good night, Penny.

42:59.893 --> 43:03.309
Good morning, Helen. How are you feeling?

43:03.409 --> 43:06.299
I'm gonna untie your hand...

43:06.399 --> 43:08.301
and check your pulse.

43:08.401 --> 43:10.945
Is that okay?

43:17.677 --> 43:19.561
Mr. Jackson!

43:34.994 --> 43:36.896
Hold her still.

43:36.996 --> 43:39.347
Clear her arm.

43:43.002 --> 43:46.072
We can't keep replacing
one drug with another.

43:46.172 --> 43:49.353
If Helen can't settle soon,
we have got to get more help.

43:52.345 --> 43:55.256
You two better get breakfast.

44:12.198 --> 44:15.235
Casey can handle this for a few hours.
You should get some sleep.

44:15.335 --> 44:17.704
I don't have time.

44:17.804 --> 44:22.208
I've got to move bees up
to a farmer's watermelon field.

44:22.308 --> 44:25.144
I could be back here at noon.

44:25.244 --> 44:28.129
You go. We'll see you later.

44:28.731 --> 44:30.817
Casey, come on over here.

44:30.917 --> 44:34.269
I want to show you
how to check these restraints.

44:46.232 --> 44:49.709
Reckon you could miss school a day
and help me move some bees?

44:50.837 --> 44:53.188
They wouldn't mind.

45:09.956 --> 45:12.568
How many places you keep bees?

45:15.461 --> 45:17.530
Three, four...

45:17.630 --> 45:19.132
five at a time.

45:19.232 --> 45:21.139
Changes during the year.

45:23.569 --> 45:25.749
Did you ever lose any?

45:26.572 --> 45:29.514
You mean, forget where they were?

45:32.245 --> 45:35.460
No, I don't think so.

45:37.083 --> 45:38.933
That's good.

46:00.840 --> 46:01.908
What happened?

46:02.008 --> 46:04.510
Bear had himself a snack.

46:04.610 --> 46:07.580
- Is he coming back?
- Not likely.

46:07.680 --> 46:10.416
But you never can tell.

46:10.516 --> 46:13.019
And the bees, are they hurt?

46:13.119 --> 46:15.588
Some got scared off...

46:15.688 --> 46:19.336
but if we look around careful,
we might find a few.

46:36.809 --> 46:40.252
Put these gloves and this hat on, okay?

46:41.848 --> 46:45.098
Just to be safe.

46:59.198 --> 47:01.334
Aren't you afraid of getting stung?

47:01.434 --> 47:04.170
Ah, you got to keep your calm around bees.

47:04.270 --> 47:06.906
They can sense fear right off.

47:07.006 --> 47:08.808
It makes them panic.

47:08.908 --> 47:12.123
Now, you stay back here, just to be safe.

48:00.760 --> 48:02.361
You're very good.

48:02.461 --> 48:04.311
Sometimes.

48:08.801 --> 48:12.449
You know, I thought I'd remember my ma...

48:13.573 --> 48:14.640
but I can't.

48:14.740 --> 48:17.091
You will, Penny.

48:17.944 --> 48:20.556
Just be patient is all.

49:54.373 --> 49:56.309
My goodness, Penny.

49:56.409 --> 49:59.920
You haven't grown up on us, now, have you?

50:08.917 --> 50:11.684
Still hitting up on the tourists, Bill?

50:11.784 --> 50:15.294
These local bribes and kickbacks are not
enough anymore. I gotta earn my salary.

50:15.394 --> 50:19.207
You gotta do all kinds of disgusting
things when you work for the government.

50:19.307 --> 50:21.356
Now, Ulee...

50:21.456 --> 50:23.970
you know I didn't have anything to do
with Jimmy needing to be put away.

50:24.070 --> 50:25.771
He did that all on his own.

50:25.871 --> 50:29.121
Well, that's one thing
you and I can agree on.

50:30.109 --> 50:31.944
Damn it, Ulee.

50:32.044 --> 50:35.381
Six years is long enough
to mourn anyone, even Penelope.

50:35.481 --> 50:39.595
- She wouldn't have wanted it.
- Penny, get in the truck.

50:42.288 --> 50:44.639
How's Helen?

50:45.291 --> 50:46.626
Miss Hope told you?

50:46.726 --> 50:49.428
You can't figure something like that
is gonna stay secret.

50:49.528 --> 50:52.531
It's a Jackson mess, and Jacksons
are the ones who gotta take care of it.

50:52.631 --> 50:54.533
I know, Ulee.

50:54.633 --> 50:58.104
You might try taking just a little help
from someone once in a...

50:58.204 --> 51:00.782
Consider it a bribe.

51:01.474 --> 51:03.324
Thanks.

51:04.143 --> 51:06.994
They're always welcome.

51:30.669 --> 51:32.178
Helen's settled.

51:36.275 --> 51:39.111
For her, this will be the hardest part.

51:39.211 --> 51:42.222
It's all turned inward now.

52:10.910 --> 52:13.245
You should have left me alone in Orlando.

52:13.345 --> 52:15.696
I was doing fine.

52:17.216 --> 52:18.895
Jimmy asked me.

52:20.352 --> 52:23.356
Once you're better,
I don't care what you do.

52:23.456 --> 52:26.659
But you're not moving until
all that poison's out of your body.

52:26.759 --> 52:29.228
- Even if only for a day.
- Oh, man.

52:29.328 --> 52:31.497
You always think you know, don't you?

52:31.597 --> 52:34.107
I know better than to run
from responsibility.

52:35.835 --> 52:38.277
- Is that right?
- Right.

52:39.171 --> 52:41.574
There's all kinds of running.

52:41.674 --> 52:45.678
Your body might have stuck around and
that lousy bully part of your mind...

52:45.778 --> 52:47.680
but your heart took off a long time ago.

52:47.780 --> 52:51.132
No, you can't say that. That's not true.

52:52.284 --> 52:54.186
Maybe you're right.

52:54.286 --> 52:56.922
Maybe you never cared anything
about anybody.

52:57.022 --> 53:00.067
Year after year, nothing touches Ulee.

53:00.893 --> 53:05.131
It was you and Jimmy
wanted too many shortcuts.

53:05.231 --> 53:08.934
I told Jimmy if he went down that road,
I wouldn't lift a finger to help him.

53:09.034 --> 53:11.704
And you both managed major fuckups!

53:11.804 --> 53:14.473
Who the hell are you, Mrs. Helen Jackson?

53:14.573 --> 53:17.009
A mother? Wife?

53:17.109 --> 53:19.311
- No, you're nothing.
- Come on.

53:19.411 --> 53:22.922
And we don't need the whole damn world
knowing what's going on in our house.

54:02.121 --> 54:03.937
Have some tea?

54:13.399 --> 54:15.340
Thanks.

54:35.087 --> 54:37.523
Looks like quite a load.

54:37.623 --> 54:41.237
I don't usually bring
a truckload of bees home.

54:42.995 --> 54:47.280
But, as you know, things haven't been
too normal around here lately.

55:00.779 --> 55:05.394
What's the word for beekeeper?
Apiary? Apiarist?

55:06.552 --> 55:09.062
Beekeeper is easier.

55:11.423 --> 55:14.326
Somebody told me they used to
make a lot of honey around here.

55:14.426 --> 55:15.995
I learned from my dad...

55:16.095 --> 55:18.810
and he learned from his.

55:19.932 --> 55:22.101
Tupelo is premium grade.

55:22.201 --> 55:25.571
But the bloom only lasts two,
maybe three weeks.

55:25.671 --> 55:29.080
We make most of our money
working that bloom.

55:29.842 --> 55:34.313
Then we move the bees
up to honeydew melons and such.

55:34.413 --> 55:36.982
That's for bakery grade.

55:37.082 --> 55:40.263
That's what the load outside's for.

55:41.053 --> 55:45.065
And in January, we move the bees
to winter clover.

55:46.158 --> 55:50.477
What with the extracting
and worrying about diseases...

55:51.897 --> 55:54.066
it's pretty hard work.

55:54.166 --> 55:56.835
Most young folks...

55:56.935 --> 55:59.286
can't be bothered.

56:02.741 --> 56:05.956
Best not to get me going on bees.

56:24.396 --> 56:27.373
May I ask about your wife?

56:40.212 --> 56:43.257
Penelope died six years ago.

56:45.718 --> 56:47.397
We grew up together.

56:49.955 --> 56:51.566
What did she do?

56:55.994 --> 56:58.345
Kept house...

56:59.765 --> 57:02.116
looked after folks.

57:04.303 --> 57:07.306
She had a lot to put up with.

57:07.406 --> 57:09.341
My hitch in Nam...

57:09.441 --> 57:12.452
the V.A. Hospital for my knee...

57:13.746 --> 57:16.961
raising Jimmy without a dad around...

57:17.716 --> 57:21.220
and me working to build
the hives back up...

57:21.320 --> 57:24.900
while I wasn't sure anything made...

57:26.391 --> 57:28.742
made sense anymore.

57:31.163 --> 57:33.932
And just when it...

57:34.032 --> 57:36.212
And just when it all...

57:40.739 --> 57:42.714
I guess there's...

57:43.242 --> 57:47.254
there's never a good time to lose anybody.

57:49.348 --> 57:52.084
It hit Jimmy and Helen hard.

57:52.184 --> 57:54.569
I pretty much fell off the planet.

57:57.689 --> 58:00.574
You must have loved her very much.

58:01.093 --> 58:04.430
If it hadn't been for Casey and Penny...

58:04.530 --> 58:06.972
and the bees...

58:08.867 --> 58:11.218
Maybe you can be too close.

58:13.205 --> 58:16.887
I'll always wonder if she
was ever really happy.

58:20.679 --> 58:22.688
Pardon me.

58:24.116 --> 58:26.660
I'm just all worn out.

58:35.627 --> 58:37.978
And now me.

58:39.031 --> 58:41.133
I'm divorced.

58:41.233 --> 58:43.469
Twice, actually.

58:43.569 --> 58:46.420
No kids, fortunately.

58:48.307 --> 58:51.750
I guess, fortunately.

58:55.013 --> 58:58.263
This time I got away as far as I could.

59:02.321 --> 59:04.323
I like the country...

59:04.423 --> 59:06.774
and being near water.

59:08.427 --> 59:10.778
So here I am.

59:16.768 --> 59:18.303
You don't approve, do you?

59:18.403 --> 59:21.273
I didn't say anything.

59:21.373 --> 59:23.314
I can tell.

59:24.710 --> 59:28.221
You're an old-fashioned,
"ties that bind" kind of guy.

59:30.382 --> 59:32.985
Whatever happens, you stay the course.
Isn't that right?

59:33.085 --> 59:36.054
Miss Hope, I'm just realizing...

59:36.154 --> 59:40.063
I don't know enough about anything
to say nothing.

59:49.167 --> 59:51.108
It's Connie.

59:58.310 --> 01:00:00.512
I'm sorry about the sheriff.

01:00:00.612 --> 01:00:05.056
He said that folks had seen you
and Helen coming into town.

01:00:18.897 --> 01:00:23.114
This is my number at the hospital,
the clinic, my beeper.

01:00:24.436 --> 01:00:27.344
Keep me posted.

01:03:37.162 --> 01:03:38.997
Why can't I come see you?

01:03:39.097 --> 01:03:42.267
There are a lot of things going on.
I need to work 'em out.

01:03:42.367 --> 01:03:44.569
I know. Soon, then?

01:03:44.669 --> 01:03:48.040
Yeah. Know where Ulee is?

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:49.808
He just came in.

01:03:49.908 --> 01:03:51.877
I need to speak to him.

01:03:51.977 --> 01:03:53.879
- I miss you, Dad.
- I miss you.

01:03:53.979 --> 01:03:55.829
Take care.

01:04:00.619 --> 01:04:03.021
Hello, Jimmy.
I've been meaning to call you.

01:04:03.121 --> 01:04:07.592
I've been going crazy. How is she?
What the hell's going on?

01:04:07.692 --> 01:04:10.529
Helen is okay, we think.

01:04:10.629 --> 01:04:14.299
Eddie called, said you have
something important to give me.

01:04:14.399 --> 01:04:17.469
- So why haven't you called?
- I plan to come day after tomorrow.

01:04:17.569 --> 01:04:20.472
What do you mean? I need to see you.

01:04:20.572 --> 01:04:23.942
I'm moving bees, Jimmy.
My back's killing me.

01:04:24.042 --> 01:04:26.378
Day after tomorrow, if I'm still standing.

01:04:26.478 --> 01:04:28.328
I need to see...

01:04:36.488 --> 01:04:38.490
Has Connie come by?

01:04:38.590 --> 01:04:40.325
She checked in.

01:04:40.425 --> 01:04:43.295
Said she figured we'd be okay
without her today.

01:04:43.395 --> 01:04:45.973
She also took Penny to school.

01:04:47.065 --> 01:04:49.074
And Helen?

01:04:49.901 --> 01:04:51.870
Out like a light.

01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:55.040
Connie said she's making up for lost time.

01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:57.149
Yeah, good for her.

01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:01.061
Is my dad in trouble?

01:05:02.814 --> 01:05:05.617
I don't know. Might be.

01:05:05.717 --> 01:05:09.069
I'll know for sure when I see him.

01:05:12.824 --> 01:05:15.594
- I can make up the sofa.
- No.

01:05:15.694 --> 01:05:19.046
With my back, the floor is better.

01:05:19.831 --> 01:05:22.182
I'll only be a minute.

01:05:27.138 --> 01:05:29.785
Wake me up in time to get Penny.

01:05:51.363 --> 01:05:53.698
What you got today?

01:05:53.798 --> 01:05:55.910
Nothing.

01:05:57.702 --> 01:06:00.053
It's for my mom.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.916
Yeah?

01:06:11.016 --> 01:06:13.025
Uh-uh.

01:06:14.386 --> 01:06:16.862
No, I can't tonight, Markie.

01:06:19.457 --> 01:06:22.060
Of course. I miss you too.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.738
I'm really busy right now.

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:28.911
All right. Talk to you later. Bye.

01:06:55.193 --> 01:06:57.202
How is she?

01:07:09.908 --> 01:07:14.579
And see, sometimes
the bees get confused...

01:07:14.679 --> 01:07:17.015
and run away.

01:07:17.115 --> 01:07:20.151
That's them there on the tree.

01:07:20.251 --> 01:07:23.364
But they don't really wanna be gone...

01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:28.772
and they're happy when someone
helps 'em back into their home.

01:07:33.898 --> 01:07:37.235
But you gotta keep calm...

01:07:37.335 --> 01:07:40.005
and don't panic when they sting...

01:07:40.105 --> 01:07:42.207
'cause...

01:07:42.307 --> 01:07:44.749
they don't mean nothing by it.

01:07:47.612 --> 01:07:50.548
And you made this all by yourself?

01:07:50.648 --> 01:07:52.384
No sweat.

01:07:52.484 --> 01:07:56.234
I can make you a new one tomorrow,
if you want.

01:07:58.490 --> 01:08:00.670
That'd be real nice.

01:08:03.328 --> 01:08:06.164
That's the tupelo swamp.

01:08:06.264 --> 01:08:08.266
And that's what Ulee does...

01:08:08.366 --> 01:08:11.251
when he goes out to those bees.

01:08:56.814 --> 01:09:00.759
Okay, so what do I do?

01:09:01.252 --> 01:09:03.966
- Go to bed.
- Give me a break, Ulee.

01:09:07.759 --> 01:09:10.228
This side, then.

01:09:10.328 --> 01:09:12.897
Put the empties back
into the supers and...

01:09:12.997 --> 01:09:15.245
stack 'em against the wall.

01:10:41.786 --> 01:10:46.435
Damn, Jimmy.
You said you never saw the bank money.

01:10:46.925 --> 01:10:49.276
That's what I told everybody...

01:10:50.295 --> 01:10:51.930
except Helen.

01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:54.599
How could you have gotten
your hands on all that cash...

01:10:54.699 --> 01:10:56.768
without Eddie and Ferris knowing?

01:10:56.868 --> 01:10:59.938
It was one of them armored vans.

01:11:00.038 --> 01:11:02.719
They don't usually carry bank deliveries.

01:11:03.441 --> 01:11:07.879
Eddie and Ferris looked in the usual
places and found what they expected.

01:11:07.979 --> 01:11:09.881
While they were dealing with the guards...

01:11:09.981 --> 01:11:13.492
I spotted an unmarked bag
and threw it in my trunk.

01:11:14.319 --> 01:11:18.103
I didn't really mean to keep it all,
but when we got split up and...

01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:21.499
I got caught...

01:11:24.729 --> 01:11:28.666
Damn. How could she tell 'em?
How could she be such an idiot?

01:11:28.766 --> 01:11:31.583
She was in terrible shape, Jimmy.

01:11:33.838 --> 01:11:37.418
I can't even think about
what she might've been through.

01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:42.213
There's supposed to be payment for this.

01:11:42.313 --> 01:11:45.096
You've got to tell the law, son.

01:11:46.985 --> 01:11:49.153
There's gotta be some way.

01:11:49.253 --> 01:11:53.525
Not all this time, this shit.

01:11:53.625 --> 01:11:55.860
Eddie meant it.

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.362
Eddie's a coward.

01:11:57.462 --> 01:11:59.972
Not with Ferris around, he's not.

01:12:00.965 --> 01:12:03.145
They'll come after the girls.

01:12:03.801 --> 01:12:07.872
- They'll come after all of us.
- You gotta get rid of 'em.

01:12:07.972 --> 01:12:11.309
You're a big jungle fighter,
for God's sake.

01:12:11.409 --> 01:12:13.657
They ain't worth shit.

01:12:14.379 --> 01:12:18.323
Kill 'em. You'll be doing
the world a big favor.

01:12:20.418 --> 01:12:23.099
I didn't hear that, Jimmy.

01:12:30.662 --> 01:12:32.944
When Eddie called, I...

01:12:35.166 --> 01:12:38.746
I had an idea this was what it was about.

01:12:43.107 --> 01:12:45.287
Oh, fuck!

01:12:54.052 --> 01:12:57.221
You know your yard near Blood Springs?

01:12:57.321 --> 01:12:59.257
Right under your nose the whole time.

01:12:59.357 --> 01:13:01.326
It's in a cooler...

01:13:01.426 --> 01:13:05.210
under the old truck cab out in the swamp.

01:13:07.131 --> 01:13:09.709
I used silicon, duct tape.

01:13:12.236 --> 01:13:14.518
Should be bone-dry.

01:13:15.473 --> 01:13:19.010
Look under a board wedged
under the driver's side door.

01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:21.188
What a mess.

01:13:22.647 --> 01:13:24.827
You gonna be okay?

01:13:25.316 --> 01:13:27.564
Save us all.

01:13:29.987 --> 01:13:32.167
Wish us luck.

01:13:38.996 --> 01:13:42.600
- Speak to me.
- Eddie, this is Ulee Jackson.

01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:46.604
Jimmy told me I should let you know
we had our conversation...

01:13:46.704 --> 01:13:48.573
and delivery's under way.

01:13:48.673 --> 01:13:50.908
I knew it!

01:13:51.008 --> 01:13:54.451
Goddamn fantastic!

01:13:57.448 --> 01:14:01.460
Hello? Hello, Ulee? You still there?

01:14:02.787 --> 01:14:04.856
Yeah, I'm afraid so, Eddie.

01:14:04.956 --> 01:14:07.191
I'm still gonna need a couple of days.

01:14:07.291 --> 01:14:09.861
I can be down there Saturday,
like we said.

01:14:09.961 --> 01:14:12.163
No funny stuff, all right, Mr. Jackson?

01:14:12.263 --> 01:14:15.033
No, Eddie, no funny stuff. I gotta go.

01:14:15.133 --> 01:14:18.770
We'll see you Saturday with the money?

01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:20.777
You bet.

01:14:58.910 --> 01:15:00.817
How are you feeling?

01:15:03.114 --> 01:15:05.294
Not so good.

01:15:10.855 --> 01:15:14.264
Do you need some food or something to eat?

01:15:14.859 --> 01:15:19.713
A glass of water would be nice,
just out of the faucet.

01:15:47.925 --> 01:15:50.435
Jimmy used to drink like that.

01:15:52.263 --> 01:15:54.265
How's he doing?

01:15:54.365 --> 01:15:56.534
He's holding.

01:15:56.634 --> 01:15:58.609
Thanks.

01:16:01.706 --> 01:16:03.875
Thank you...

01:16:03.975 --> 01:16:06.383
for getting me out of Orlando...

01:16:07.879 --> 01:16:10.059
bringing me home.

01:16:20.791 --> 01:16:24.177
I'm afraid we're not over Orlando yet.

01:16:29.133 --> 01:16:32.703
- What do you mean?
- The money from the holdup.

01:16:32.803 --> 01:16:37.054
Eddie and Ferris have found out
that Jimmy had it after all.

01:16:38.142 --> 01:16:41.460
I'm supposed to bring it
to them this weekend.

01:16:43.681 --> 01:16:46.965
This is my fault, isn't it?

01:16:47.718 --> 01:16:51.536
They got me thinking
they knew about it all along.

01:16:51.856 --> 01:16:54.659
They acted like they knew
the money was hid.

01:16:54.759 --> 01:16:56.828
They knew Jimmy didn't tell me where.

01:16:56.928 --> 01:17:00.898
They talked about how when Jimmy
got out, we'd all go to Mexico together.

01:17:00.998 --> 01:17:03.568
God, I'm so stupid.

01:17:03.668 --> 01:17:07.071
If they hadn't found me,
they would never have known.

01:17:07.171 --> 01:17:09.607
God, Ulee, I'm sorry.

01:17:09.707 --> 01:17:12.043
Don't fret, Helen.

01:17:12.143 --> 01:17:15.346
That's no kind of secret to have to keep.

01:17:15.446 --> 01:17:17.797
What are you gonna do?

01:17:19.183 --> 01:17:21.363
Give them the money.

01:17:22.019 --> 01:17:24.555
Eddie and Ferris are crazy...

01:17:24.655 --> 01:17:29.133
and there's no telling what the law
might make of Jimmy and all that cash.

01:18:54.345 --> 01:18:57.748
Damn it, Ulee, I was counting on
30 drums of tupelo.

01:18:57.848 --> 01:19:01.852
Eighteen's all I can manage.
At least you got the bakery grade.

01:19:01.952 --> 01:19:03.854
I can get that anytime.

01:19:03.954 --> 01:19:06.891
You've never let me down before, Ulee.

01:19:06.991 --> 01:19:09.393
Stuff's come up, Chance.

01:19:09.493 --> 01:19:13.230
If you still want it, the rest of
the tupelo will be ready next week.

01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:16.910
- I'll let you know.
- You do that, Chance.

01:19:18.436 --> 01:19:21.072
I'll be damned. In all these years.

01:19:21.172 --> 01:19:23.240
Don't you want a receipt?

01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:25.520
Oh, yeah. Where is it?

01:19:33.117 --> 01:19:34.752
You okay?

01:19:34.852 --> 01:19:36.253
Why?

01:19:36.353 --> 01:19:37.989
No reason.

01:19:38.089 --> 01:19:40.098
I'll call.

01:19:41.625 --> 01:19:43.475
Thanks for this.

01:21:02.806 --> 01:21:06.043
- How's it going? Can I help?
- What's that?

01:21:06.143 --> 01:21:08.212
Carry a bag.

01:21:08.312 --> 01:21:10.481
No, that's okay. I can manage.

01:21:10.581 --> 01:21:12.983
Tough Man Jackson
carries his own groceries.

01:21:13.083 --> 01:21:15.486
No. Really, Connie, I can do it.

01:21:15.586 --> 01:21:20.091
Are you a pure chauvinist gentleman,
or are you afraid I'll expect a tip?

01:21:20.191 --> 01:21:22.200
No, Connie.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:27.965
I'm so turned around, I've forgotten
how to deal with new things...

01:21:28.065 --> 01:21:30.074
new feelings...

01:21:30.834 --> 01:21:32.650
new people.

01:21:36.073 --> 01:21:40.085
You are almost a good man,
Ulee Jackson, but you try too hard.

01:21:41.345 --> 01:21:44.822
Tell Helen if she needs anything, call me.

01:22:38.569 --> 01:22:42.114
- You don't have a TV?
- It broke.

01:22:44.875 --> 01:22:46.554
No TV...

01:22:48.279 --> 01:22:50.994
and no guns.

01:22:52.316 --> 01:22:57.087
I thought I had till Saturday.
I was supposed to meet you downstate.

01:22:57.187 --> 01:22:59.990
We thought we'd pay you a visit instead.

01:23:00.090 --> 01:23:01.659
Who's the lady?

01:23:01.759 --> 01:23:03.694
No one.

01:23:03.794 --> 01:23:07.874
She rents from us across the street.

01:23:08.599 --> 01:23:11.883
Actually, Eddie, it's a relief to see you.

01:23:15.272 --> 01:23:19.989
Now we can get this whole thing over with.

01:23:32.056 --> 01:23:34.304
Where's your car?

01:23:35.759 --> 01:23:39.771
- Didn't notice it outside.
- It's out behind Cy's Garage.

01:23:40.864 --> 01:23:42.866
We thought it'd be safer there.

01:23:42.966 --> 01:23:45.102
Don't tell 'em anything.
They're full of crap.

01:23:45.202 --> 01:23:48.554
Ain't she a peach, Eddie?
Just like her mom.

01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:51.575
You're assholes
for what you did to my mom!

01:23:51.675 --> 01:23:55.459
We didn't do it all, honey,
but we do know a thing or two.

01:24:01.685 --> 01:24:05.256
Ferris, hurt any one of them...

01:24:05.356 --> 01:24:08.037
and you won't get a damn thing.

01:24:11.628 --> 01:24:14.411
Leave it alone, Ferris.

01:24:18.902 --> 01:24:21.981
Now, Mr. Jackson...

01:24:22.639 --> 01:24:27.390
you can see that we have got to get
Ferris's mind out of the gutter.

01:24:28.278 --> 01:24:31.960
- Where's the money?
- One of my beeyards.

01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:36.268
I'll have to take you in my pickup.
You couldn't find it.

01:24:40.057 --> 01:24:43.327
And to think we owe it all to Helen.

01:24:43.427 --> 01:24:48.165
Gracias, Helen, for letting
the cat out of the bag.

01:24:48.265 --> 01:24:49.767
You're a shit.

01:24:49.867 --> 01:24:51.835
I had to find out.

01:24:51.935 --> 01:24:54.115
I had a right.

01:24:56.173 --> 01:24:58.542
And now, Mr. Jackson, let's go.

01:24:58.642 --> 01:25:02.517
- Ferris, stay put. We'll be back soon.
- Can't do it, Eddie.

01:25:03.113 --> 01:25:07.017
- What do you mean, you can't do it?
- Like you said...

01:25:07.117 --> 01:25:09.297
Ferris needs distracting.

01:25:10.254 --> 01:25:12.656
He comes with us.

01:25:12.756 --> 01:25:15.759
Let me just beat it out of him.

01:25:15.859 --> 01:25:18.595
I don't like his uppity attitude.

01:25:18.695 --> 01:25:22.099
What the hell? We'll all go.

01:25:22.199 --> 01:25:24.709
Ferris, take care of the phone.

01:25:26.703 --> 01:25:29.782
You got any duct tape, Mr. Jackson?

01:25:31.875 --> 01:25:34.157
You bet.

01:25:57.334 --> 01:25:59.685
I'm sorry about this, Helen.

01:26:00.404 --> 01:26:03.307
I'm sorry about a whole lot of things.

01:26:03.407 --> 01:26:05.758
Let's go, Mr. Jackson.

01:26:09.179 --> 01:26:11.359
Get that light.

01:26:31.702 --> 01:26:34.371
Dumb dog. Let us right in.

01:26:34.471 --> 01:26:36.607
He has a trusting soul.

01:26:36.707 --> 01:26:40.787
- I'll get a flashlight in the shop.
- I got one in my car.

01:27:14.244 --> 01:27:18.081
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Faulty return spring.

01:27:18.181 --> 01:27:19.817
Don't worry, Eddie.

01:27:19.917 --> 01:27:22.486
You're not getting any trouble from me.

01:27:22.586 --> 01:27:24.868
I fucking sure hope not.

01:27:49.079 --> 01:27:51.088
What's going on, Buckshot?

01:29:38.622 --> 01:29:40.457
Where are the bees?

01:29:40.557 --> 01:29:42.960
Their summer site. This here's for tupelo.

01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:47.038
Always seemed like a stupid business,
messing with bees.

01:29:51.168 --> 01:29:53.519
Shine the light down there.

01:29:58.942 --> 01:30:00.477
That's it.

01:30:00.577 --> 01:30:05.192
Jimmy says it's hidden behind the board
wedged under the driver's side door.

01:30:06.083 --> 01:30:07.651
Ya-hoo.

01:30:07.751 --> 01:30:10.432
Get down there and see what we got.

01:30:25.102 --> 01:30:26.803
This is disgusting.

01:30:26.903 --> 01:30:28.839
Then be quick about it.

01:30:28.939 --> 01:30:31.415
Watch out for water moccasins.

01:30:33.543 --> 01:30:35.345
No shit.

01:30:35.445 --> 01:30:37.295
You serious?

01:30:41.218 --> 01:30:45.022
- Maybe we should wait.
- Don't go trying to spook us.

01:30:45.122 --> 01:30:48.025
I'm in charge here.
Ferris, just get the damn thing!

01:30:48.125 --> 01:30:49.359
All right.

01:30:49.459 --> 01:30:51.528
I wouldn't lift a finger
to protect that money.

01:30:51.628 --> 01:30:54.197
That's real good, Mr. Jackson.
How're we doing, Ferris?

01:30:54.297 --> 01:30:56.306
Hang on.

01:31:08.645 --> 01:31:12.498
- Seems like an old cooler.
- That'd be it.

01:31:14.417 --> 01:31:17.268
It's wedged in mighty tight, though.

01:31:32.602 --> 01:31:34.452
Yeah.

01:32:07.170 --> 01:32:09.145
Jesus.

01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:11.808
- Is it all twenties?
- Yeah.

01:32:11.908 --> 01:32:14.623
Well, I ain't complaining, man.

01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:22.285
Yeah!

01:32:22.385 --> 01:32:24.394
Oh, man!

01:32:25.655 --> 01:32:28.058
New Orleans, Las Vegas.

01:32:28.158 --> 01:32:30.475
Maybe Acapulco.

01:32:54.918 --> 01:32:56.597
Fuck!

01:33:09.866 --> 01:33:12.717
You want me to cut him, Eddie?

01:33:14.204 --> 01:33:17.841
- Just tell me where.
- Neither of us needed that gun, Eddie.

01:33:17.941 --> 01:33:21.122
You got the money. Just get on back.

01:33:23.813 --> 01:33:28.785
No, Ferris. We need him
to get the fuck outta here.

01:33:28.885 --> 01:33:30.735
Let's pack this up.

01:33:31.221 --> 01:33:33.390
Let's move it.

01:33:33.490 --> 01:33:35.397
Come on!

01:34:03.019 --> 01:34:05.422
You're chicken, that's it.

01:34:05.522 --> 01:34:07.524
That's what?

01:34:07.624 --> 01:34:10.805
Why you didn't just take the gun.

01:34:14.297 --> 01:34:16.477
Ulysses Jackson.

01:34:18.134 --> 01:34:22.317
You haven't done much with your life,
have you, Mr. Jackson?

01:34:27.978 --> 01:34:32.388
Meeting someone like you, Eddie,
has done me a world of good.

01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:35.819
I don't get it.

01:34:35.919 --> 01:34:39.823
It reminds me that there's
all kinds of weakness in the world.

01:34:39.923 --> 01:34:42.092
Not all of it is evil.

01:34:42.192 --> 01:34:45.043
I forget that from time to time.

01:34:46.997 --> 01:34:48.847
Yeah?

01:34:49.666 --> 01:34:52.813
You're full of crap.

01:35:20.263 --> 01:35:22.705
Eddie, you got the keys?

01:35:29.539 --> 01:35:32.049
You take care now, Mr. Jackson.

01:35:33.009 --> 01:35:34.688
Later, Ulee.

01:35:54.497 --> 01:35:57.849
That's for that stunt
back there at the swamp.

01:36:00.637 --> 01:36:02.885
Thanks for your help.

01:36:04.707 --> 01:36:08.116
I hope you're still glad you ran into me.

01:36:29.966 --> 01:36:31.816
Yes!

01:36:52.956 --> 01:36:55.825
Crap! Eddie, what do we do?

01:36:55.925 --> 01:36:58.094
Just stay calm.

01:36:58.194 --> 01:36:59.863
The gun!

01:36:59.963 --> 01:37:05.181
- Why'd you let Ulee lose the gun?
- Ferris, just stay calm.

01:37:15.245 --> 01:37:17.926
Evening, Sheriff. How you doing?

01:37:22.752 --> 01:37:25.797
Eddie. Eddie Flowers.

01:37:29.025 --> 01:37:31.761
And Ferris Dooley.

01:37:31.861 --> 01:37:34.974
I don't believe it.

01:37:36.566 --> 01:37:38.034
Been a long time.

01:37:38.134 --> 01:37:39.984
Yeah.

01:37:40.670 --> 01:37:43.440
- What you boys been doing?
- Nothing.

01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:45.208
We were just passing through.

01:37:45.308 --> 01:37:48.111
We thought we'd take a quick spin
around for old time's sake.

01:37:48.211 --> 01:37:50.413
You got a bad brake light, you know that?

01:37:50.513 --> 01:37:52.482
Gosh, no, I sure didn't.

01:37:52.582 --> 01:37:55.593
We'll take care of that as soon as we can.

01:37:56.085 --> 01:37:58.321
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sir.

01:37:58.421 --> 01:38:02.865
- Where'd you say you fellas are headed?
- Orlando. Back to Orlando.

01:38:09.599 --> 01:38:11.101
That your cooler?

01:38:11.201 --> 01:38:13.051
- No.
- Yeah.

01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:19.509
- What you been keeping in it?
- It's his.

01:38:19.609 --> 01:38:22.961
Just snacks, you know,
drinks for the road.

01:38:24.113 --> 01:38:26.498
Looks like it's been in the water forever.

01:38:28.017 --> 01:38:29.919
Do you mind if we...

01:38:30.019 --> 01:38:33.030
open it up, take a look inside?

01:38:35.291 --> 01:38:39.576
The fact is, we found it
on the side of the road.

01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:44.601
I was gonna report it, sir.

01:38:44.701 --> 01:38:46.551
I swear.

01:38:47.503 --> 01:38:50.411
There's a whole lot of money in it.

01:38:51.074 --> 01:38:53.083
You'd be amazed.

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:12.770
Be still.

01:40:14.657 --> 01:40:17.167
You're on my turf now.

01:40:17.694 --> 01:40:20.045
I guess I'm not dead, then.

01:40:20.530 --> 01:40:23.766
You're fooling a lot of folks, if you are.

01:40:23.866 --> 01:40:26.274
Here.

01:40:36.512 --> 01:40:39.349
Roll over. I gotta check your bandage.

01:40:39.449 --> 01:40:41.299
Come on.

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:47.132
Good thing you can't see that.

01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:59.980
Does that feel better?

01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:06.581
How's the shoulder?

01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:09.212
My fault.

01:41:09.312 --> 01:41:11.196
I got cocky.

01:41:13.649 --> 01:41:16.159
Don't get him excited, Bill.

01:41:18.154 --> 01:41:20.505
I'll be back in a minute.

01:41:27.397 --> 01:41:29.748
You were cut pretty bad.

01:41:32.335 --> 01:41:36.279
Why do you suppose
Eddie and Ferris went after you?

01:41:37.507 --> 01:41:39.509
I haven't a clue.

01:41:39.609 --> 01:41:42.345
I always knew those boys were trouble.

01:41:42.445 --> 01:41:45.014
Now it turns out they're thieves as well.

01:41:45.114 --> 01:41:49.023
They're the ones who ran with Jimmy.
Did you know that?

01:41:49.852 --> 01:41:52.533
I had my suspicions.

01:41:55.258 --> 01:41:58.861
Jimmy sure put himself and us
through a lot of extra grief...

01:41:58.961 --> 01:42:00.863
not ratting on those boys.

01:42:00.963 --> 01:42:04.367
I could never figure if he was really
standing up for his buddies...

01:42:04.467 --> 01:42:07.937
or whether he had
some long-range plan in mind...

01:42:08.037 --> 01:42:11.787
like the bank money.

01:42:13.142 --> 01:42:17.495
But now it turns out these guys
had the money all along.

01:42:18.247 --> 01:42:20.483
Well, they probably came back...

01:42:20.583 --> 01:42:23.230
figured enough time had gone by.

01:42:24.387 --> 01:42:26.923
They told some wild story about...

01:42:27.023 --> 01:42:31.035
you giving it to 'em,
that you were in on it all the time.

01:42:32.495 --> 01:42:34.675
But I knew better.

01:42:36.599 --> 01:42:39.669
It turns out there are
three warrants out on those boys.

01:42:39.769 --> 01:42:42.905
Now, you add grand theft
and assault with a deadly weapon...

01:42:43.005 --> 01:42:45.408
that should be enough to put 'em away
for a long while.

01:42:45.508 --> 01:42:48.010
Let me know when they get out.

01:42:48.110 --> 01:42:50.392
They're not friendly.

01:42:52.515 --> 01:42:55.451
I still can't figure out...

01:42:55.551 --> 01:42:59.355
since they had all that money
hidden away...

01:42:59.455 --> 01:43:02.602
why they bothered messing with you.

01:43:06.796 --> 01:43:10.166
I didn't know anything
until last week, Bill...

01:43:10.266 --> 01:43:13.982
and I wasn't sure exactly what to do.

01:43:19.141 --> 01:43:22.652
Must've been they wanted
some of your honey.

01:43:26.249 --> 01:43:29.191
You get well now, you hear?

01:44:48.364 --> 01:44:52.802
We were on the pier.
Panama City, spring break.

01:44:52.902 --> 01:44:55.404
He's a lot cuter than this.

01:44:55.504 --> 01:44:58.341
I'm sure he is,
but is he treating you right?

01:44:58.441 --> 01:45:02.011
I'm not taking any crap from him,
if that's what you mean.

01:45:02.111 --> 01:45:03.846
That's good.

01:45:03.946 --> 01:45:07.416
You tell him your old man
might be getting out next year.

01:45:07.516 --> 01:45:10.586
He's gonna have an ex-con on his case
if he ever messes up.

01:45:10.686 --> 01:45:14.334
- Is that true?
- As much as these things can be.

01:45:15.958 --> 01:45:18.969
It's still a hell of a long time.

01:45:19.695 --> 01:45:22.376
I know.

01:45:33.442 --> 01:45:35.918
How are you feeling?

01:45:38.314 --> 01:45:39.715
Fine.

01:45:39.815 --> 01:45:43.386
With my shoulder and all,
I fell behind a spell, but...

01:45:43.486 --> 01:45:47.990
Charley Myers did a good job
helping me get caught up.

01:45:48.090 --> 01:45:50.326
And the bees?

01:45:50.426 --> 01:45:53.462
Hell, mites are choking 'em...

01:45:53.562 --> 01:45:55.640
insecticides are killing 'em...

01:45:56.332 --> 01:45:58.512
the drought's starving 'em.

01:45:59.602 --> 01:46:01.816
They're fine.

01:46:03.305 --> 01:46:06.909
Think there might be something
for me to do back there?

01:46:07.009 --> 01:46:09.087
With you?

01:46:10.513 --> 01:46:12.315
I don't know, Jimmy.

01:46:12.415 --> 01:46:15.351
The future of bees
isn't too clear right now.

01:46:15.451 --> 01:46:19.021
That stuff about the mites
and all is true.

01:46:19.121 --> 01:46:22.871
Anything would be grand compared
to what I'll be coming from.

01:46:26.896 --> 01:46:29.907
I'll start up an increase yard
this summer.

01:46:31.133 --> 01:46:33.984
I hope I can remember how to work.

01:47:00.029 --> 01:47:01.879
Good job.

01:47:13.976 --> 01:47:16.012
What's up?

01:47:16.112 --> 01:47:17.680
Nothing, Ulee.

01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:19.582
It's just girl talk.

01:47:19.682 --> 01:47:22.363
You wouldn't understand.

01:47:28.758 --> 01:47:30.608
Looks good.

01:47:31.694 --> 01:47:33.544
Yeah.

01:47:47.409 --> 01:47:49.919
Hello, Buckshot.

01:47:55.317 --> 01:47:57.031
Come on in.

01:47:58.587 --> 01:48:00.904
Don't you ever stop?

01:48:01.323 --> 01:48:03.640
There's always something.

01:48:09.398 --> 01:48:11.646
I usually...

01:48:22.411 --> 01:48:24.819
Thanks, Connie.

01:48:25.981 --> 01:48:28.457
Thanks for everything.

01:48:29.251 --> 01:48:31.329
Thank you, Ulee.

01:48:36.025 --> 01:48:38.433
Sounds like everything's all right.

01:48:39.862 --> 01:48:42.932
Helen and the girls
are making up for lost time.

01:48:43.032 --> 01:48:47.545
- That's good.
- And I feel like an old drone.

01:48:47.903 --> 01:48:50.311
They don't need me now.

01:48:50.673 --> 01:48:52.921
At least, not like before.

01:48:54.243 --> 01:48:57.823
Poor Ulee. Must be hard.

01:49:00.482 --> 01:49:02.332
Sorry.

01:49:04.887 --> 01:49:07.465
How about supper?

01:49:10.192 --> 01:49:12.509
Beats a TV dinner.

01:49:13.696 --> 01:49:16.265
What's so special about
this tupelo honey of yours, anyway?

01:49:16.365 --> 01:49:18.841
First, it's very...

01:49:19.535 --> 01:49:21.203
very rare...

01:49:21.303 --> 01:49:25.107
and it never crystallizes,
no matter how long it's left out.

01:49:25.207 --> 01:49:27.576
In the whole world...

01:49:27.676 --> 01:49:30.279
only the rivers and swamps
along this area...

01:49:30.379 --> 01:49:32.414
allow the trees enough isolation...

01:49:32.514 --> 01:49:34.694
to give pure tupelo.
