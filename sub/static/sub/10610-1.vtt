EVERY GUY IN THE STATE?

54:49.053 --> 54:51.787
        NO! HOLDEN, THIS IS
        ALL BECAUSE OF YOU!

54:51.856 --> 54:53.522
            HE HAD ME
            OVER A BARREL.

54:53.591 --> 54:54.523
            IF I DIDN'T
            SLEEP WITH HIM,

54:54.592 --> 54:55.891
            HE WAS GOING TO TELL
            PHIL ABOUT US.

54:55.960 --> 54:58.327
I'M SO ALONE!

54:58.396 --> 55:00.462
            YOU'VE GOT TO GET
            HOLD OF YOURSELF.

55:00.531 --> 55:03.065

55:04.168 --> 55:05.534
YES, I'M DRUNK!

55:05.603 --> 55:07.269
AND I'LL BE DRUNK EVERY DAY
UNTIL THE DAY I DIE!

55:07.338 --> 55:08.504
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

55:08.572 --> 55:11.140
YOU'LL JUMP ON ANY PECKER
THAT'S PUT IN FRONT OF YOU!

55:11.208 --> 55:13.108
            IT'S NOT
            WHAT YOU THINK.

55:13.177 --> 55:14.943
I SAW EVERYTHING!

55:15.012 --> 55:17.379
OH, GOD!
OH, MY GOD!

55:17.448 --> 55:19.515
            OK, GO HOME,

            AND WE WILL
            TALK ABOUT THIS.

55:21.919 --> 55:23.152
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

55:23.220 --> 55:25.254
            I GOT TO HELP PHIL
            WITH HIS SPERM.

55:25.323 --> 55:26.322

55:26.390 --> 55:27.523
                JUST GO!

55:27.591 --> 55:28.724
                GO ON!
    WAIT...

55:28.793 --> 55:31.060
I CAN'T SHARE YOU, JUSTINE!

55:31.128 --> 55:32.061
MAYBE WITH ONE MAN,

55:32.129 --> 55:34.296
BUT NOT WITH
A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM!

55:37.935 --> 55:39.802
        OH, GREAT.

55:47.144 --> 55:49.511
    Nurse: MR. LAST,
    WOULD YOU COME WITH ME?

55:51.582 --> 55:52.881
                WISH ME LUCK.

56:05.696 --> 56:07.029
YOU LOOK NICE.

56:07.098 --> 56:08.964
            NO, I DON'T.

56:09.033 --> 56:11.467
I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY,
AND I CAN FIGURE WHY,

56:11.535 --> 56:13.969
BUT FROM WHERE I STAND,

56:14.038 --> 56:16.472
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY
WAS A WONDERFUL THING.

56:16.540 --> 56:19.808
        NOTHING HAPPENED
        YESTERDAY, SO DROP IT.

56:22.580 --> 56:24.813
WELL, I'M AWFUL GRATEFUL

LET ME JUST
ASK YOU ONE THING.

56:40.464 --> 56:42.831
HOW DO I STACK UP
AGAINST PHIL...

56:42.900 --> 56:44.500
    YOU KNOW?

56:44.568 --> 56:47.169
HOW DO I STACK UP
AGAINST HIM WHERE IT COUNTS?

56:47.238 --> 56:48.837
            MA'AM?

56:48.906 --> 56:51.573
    YOUR HUSBAND HAS MADE
    A REQUEST FOR YOUR PRESENCE.

56:53.344 --> 56:54.743
        [KNOCK ON DOOR]

57:01.519 --> 57:03.218
    COME ON.

57:07.825 --> 57:09.925
I CAN'T DO THIS ON MY OWN.

57:09.994 --> 57:11.760
 I NEED HELP.

57:11.829 --> 57:14.763
        WHAT? YOU'VE NEVER
        DONE IT ON YOUR OWN?

57:14.832 --> 57:16.565
NOT IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

57:16.634 --> 57:20.469
NOT WHEN I HAVE TO
HAND OVER THE RESULTS.

57:20.538 --> 57:23.071
[SIGHS] JUST...

57:23.140 --> 57:25.941
LET ME HOLD YOUR BOOB.

57:26.777 --> 57:28.710

57:50.734 --> 57:53.936
        WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
        YOU LOOK LIKE DEATH.

57:54.004 --> 57:57.973
    MY STOMACH'S CRAMPING.

57:58.042 --> 58:00.108
    I FEEL SORE.

58:00.177 --> 58:01.109
            IS IT YOUR PERIOD?

58:01.178 --> 58:02.778
    NO, IT'S JUST STRESS.

58:02.847 --> 58:05.147
        I KNOW,
        THIS JOB'S STRESSFUL.

58:05.216 --> 58:07.182
            I'M BREAKING OUT.

58:07.251 --> 58:08.517
YOU'RE BREAKING OUT

58:08.586 --> 58:10.953
BECAUSE YOU PUT SO MUCH
MAKE-UP ON YOUR FACE.

58:12.022 --> 58:13.789
        MAYBE YOU'RE PREGNANT.

58:13.858 --> 58:15.290
    [LAUGHS] WHAT?

58:15.359 --> 58:17.059
        NO.

58:32.877 --> 58:35.711
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
I THINK TO MYSELF,

58:35.779 --> 58:37.546
"AT LEAST IT CAN'T
GET ANY WORSE."

58:37.615 --> 58:39.548
BUT IT CAN.

58:39.617 --> 58:41.049
IT CAN GET WORSE.

58:41.118 --> 58:43.085
AS LONG AS YOU CAN SAY
YOU HIT ROCK BOTTOM,

58:43.153 --> 58:44.920
 YOU HAVEN'T.

58:46.023 --> 58:48.323
        OH, MY GOD...

58:48.392 --> 58:49.324
        BLACKBERRIES.

58:49.393 --> 58:51.460
A BLIND MAN CAN GO DEAF,

58:51.529 --> 58:53.095
A WIDOW COULD
LOSE HER CHILDREN,

58:53.163 --> 58:56.565
BABIES STARVE
AND THEY NEVER GET FOOD.

58:58.435 --> 59:01.003
THEY NEVER GET ANY FOOD!

59:01.071 --> 59:03.906
THEY JUST COME TO THE WORLD

59:06.243 --> 59:08.143
I CAN'T CALM DOWN!

59:08.212 --> 59:09.678
IT'D BE EASY IF
I WAS A HOOKER LIKE YOU,

59:09.747 --> 59:11.547
THEN I COULD CALM DOWN
ALL OVER TOWN.

59:11.615 --> 59:12.748
            HEY!

59:13.584 --> 59:16.184
        I AM NOT A HOOKER!

59:17.021 --> 59:19.488

59:21.458 --> 59:23.525
I'M IN AGONY.

59:23.594 --> 59:24.760
            WHY?

59:24.828 --> 59:26.762
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY?
I THOUGHT YOU HATED YOUR LIFE.

59:26.830 --> 59:30.299
            I DO. I MEAN,
            I'M DEPRESSED BUT...

I'LL KILL HIM.
I'LL MURDER HIM IN HIS SLEEP.

59:43.347 --> 59:44.880
 I'LL KILL MY PARENTS,
 I'LL STEAL THEIR MONEY,

59:52.623 --> 59:53.789
                    OK.

59:53.857 --> 59:54.957
I CAN'T TAKE IT!

59:55.025 --> 59:55.991
        ALL RIGHT, I WON'T.

59:56.060 --> 59:57.593
        I WON'T, I PROMISE.

59:57.661 --> 59:59.061
         I WON'T.

59:59.129 --> 01:00:01.330
        I PROMISE, OK?

01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:06.401
    THAT HOLDEN WAS AT BEST,
        A CHILD,

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:09.538
    AND AT WORST, A DEMON.

01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:11.039
        IF I WAS EVER
    GOING TO GO STRAIGHT,

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:13.041
    I'D HAVE TO DITCH HIM.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:15.978
    SOMETIMES TO GET BACK
    ON THE ROAD TO REDEMPTION,

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:18.880
    YOU HAVE TO MAKE
    A FEW PIT STOPS.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.315
            HOW MUCH ARE
            THE BLACKBERRIES?

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:38.500
WE CAN'T KEEP
LIVING DAY-TO-DAY.

01:00:38.569 --> 01:00:40.535
WE GOT TO CHART A COURSE,
AND WE JUST GOT TO STICK--

MY HANDS ON SOME MONEY.

 TELL ME THE ANSWER.

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:16.672
I GOT TO DO--

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.040
BUT I NEVER DO ANYTHING,

01:01:18.108 --> 01:01:20.475
'CAUSE I END UP
THINKING ABOUT IT INSTEAD.

    YOUR HISTORY.

    YOUR FATHER GAVE ME A CALL,
    I GAVE YOU A JOB.

01:02:02.453 --> 01:02:03.819
    I EVEN LET YOU
    USE THAT NAME,

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:04.820
    EVEN THOUGH
    IT ISN'T YOURS,

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:05.821
    AND I NEVER DO THAT

01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:08.056
    WITH OTHER PEOPLE
    IN THE STORE, SO...

01:02:16.033 --> 01:02:19.367
        I'M WORRIED
        ABOUT HOLDEN--TOM.

         WORRIED ABOUT TOM.

01:02:22.473 --> 01:02:26.475
        I JUST BEFRIENDED
        TOM RECENTLY,

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:29.911
        AND NOW...

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.247
        WELL...

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:35.383
        I THINK
    HE'S MENTALLY ILL.

01:02:35.452 --> 01:02:37.619
    HE'S GOT THIS IDEA
        IN HIS HEAD

01:02:37.688 --> 01:02:39.921
        THAT WE'VE HAD
    SOME SORT OF AFFAIR--

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.389
        WHICH IS CRAZY,

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:43.125
        BECAUSE
    I'M--I'M MARRIED--

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:44.593
        AND--AND HE SAID--

01:02:44.661 --> 01:02:46.928
        HE'S BEEN SAYING
    ALL SORTS OF STRANGE THINGS

01:02:46.997 --> 01:02:49.498
        AND MAKING THREATS,

01:02:49.566 --> 01:02:52.400
         AND DRINKIN',

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:53.702
            AND...

01:02:57.875 --> 01:03:00.041
        AND I JUST THINK

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:02.577
    HE WOULD BE BETTER OFF
    SOMEPLACE WHERE PEOPLE--

01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:04.679
        PROFESSIONALS--

01:03:04.748 --> 01:03:06.982
    COULD TAKE CARE OF HIM.

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:08.683
    OTHERWISE, I--I--I--

01:03:08.752 --> 01:03:11.653
    HE'S GOING TO GET
    HIMSELF INTO TROUBLE.

01:03:34.678 --> 01:03:37.445
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN THERE?

01:03:37.514 --> 01:03:39.181
WHAT'S THAT?

01:03:39.249 --> 01:03:41.950
            IT'S A HOME
            PREGNANCY TEST.

01:03:42.019 --> 01:03:44.052
WHY ARE YOU TAKING IT?

01:03:44.121 --> 01:03:47.189
        BECAUSE I STILL HAVEN'T
        GOTTEN MY PERIOD.

01:03:49.026 --> 01:03:49.958
WHAT'S IT SAY?

01:03:50.027 --> 01:03:51.459
        WELL, I HAVEN'T
        TAKEN IT YET.

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:54.329
        COULD YOU GIVE ME
        A MINUTE, PLEASE?

01:03:54.398 --> 01:03:57.566
I WANT TO BE HERE
WHEN YOU FIND OUT, TINEY.

01:04:00.304 --> 01:04:02.170
            OK.

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:16.384
THE LITTLE PLASTIC
DOOHICKEY'S TURNING BLUE.

01:04:16.453 --> 01:04:18.486
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:20.355
                BLUE?

01:04:20.424 --> 01:04:22.724
BRIGHT BLUE.

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:29.598
        THAT MEANS I'M PREGNANT.

01:04:33.303 --> 01:04:35.203
ALL RIGHT!

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:36.605
        Phil: I KNEW IT.

01:04:36.673 --> 01:04:39.741
        WASTE OF TIME GOING
        TO THAT SPERM DOCTOR.

01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:41.076
