01:25.911 --> 01:27.304
Help me! Please!

01:27.348 --> 01:28.262
What's wrong?

01:28.305 --> 01:30.220
There's a man,
he's chasing me!

01:30.264 --> 01:32.048
He's-he's
trying to kill me!

01:32.092 --> 01:33.745
It's okay. Okay.
Calm down.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.095
What does he
look like?

01:35.138 --> 01:36.922
I don't know.

01:39.969 --> 01:41.623
You sure you're
being chased?

01:41.666 --> 01:42.624
Yes!

01:47.237 --> 01:48.630
You been
drinking tonight?

01:48.673 --> 01:49.892
No.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.067
Drugs?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.677
No!

01:52.721 --> 01:54.505
He chased you
down this street?

01:54.549 --> 01:55.506
Yes!

02:00.207 --> 02:02.165
Are you on any
prescription medication?Are you on any
prescription medication?

02:05.081 --> 02:07.779
Are you on any
prescription medication?

02:07.823 --> 02:11.261
Yes, but I promise you
I'm telling the truth.

02:11.305 --> 02:14.395
There was a man, he
was chasing after me.

02:14.438 --> 02:16.048
He was in
the shadows,

02:16.092 --> 02:18.790
he jumped out and
he attacked me.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.445
Please, why aren't
you doing something?

02:21.489 --> 02:22.316
What do you
want me to do?

02:22.359 --> 02:23.882
There's nobody
there.

02:23.926 --> 02:25.362
I don't know.
Call for backup.

02:25.406 --> 02:30.150
Or search the area.
I-I don't know.

02:30.193 --> 02:42.858
Go home, lady.

02:42.901 --> 02:45.165
I'm telling
the truth!

02:52.172 --> 02:53.303
Get away
from me!

02:53.347 --> 02:54.870
Hey, it's okay.
Calm down.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.916
Hey. Hey.
It's okay.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.397
All right, relax.
Relax, relax.

03:03.095 --> 03:04.923
Ma'am, are
you okay?

03:07.796 --> 03:09.232
Ma'am?

03:09.276 --> 03:11.191
Yeah, she's
fine. Thanks.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.719
Was it the
same dream?

03:17.762 --> 03:19.721
It's okay.

03:23.855 --> 03:26.597
It's all right.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.991
Julia.. Julia!

03:49.925 --> 03:52.449
Please, please.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.459
Julia?

04:02.503 --> 04:05.201
Julia, can
you hear me?

04:05.245 --> 04:06.942
This new medication
isn't working.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.639
Where are you?

04:08.683 --> 04:11.381
A plane. You said
that these would work.

04:11.425 --> 04:12.948
I said that they
would take time

04:12.991 --> 04:14.863
to take
full effect.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.690
I don't know how
long I can hold out.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.306
Ma'am, you're gonna need
to return to your seat.

04:23.350 --> 04:24.351
Just a minute.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.615
Did you have
another dream?

04:27.658 --> 04:30.095
I-I don't know if
they're dreams anymore.

04:31.445 --> 04:32.750
Ma'am, please.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.317
Just a minute!

04:37.233 --> 04:39.670
Okay, Julia,
listen to me.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.459
Until you accept what
you are experiencing

04:45.502 --> 04:47.504
is a dream and
not a memory,

04:47.548 --> 04:49.767
you are never going
to get better, Julia.

04:49.811 --> 04:52.292
And these shadow men
that are chasing you

04:52.335 --> 04:54.337
are figments of your
imagination brought on

04:54.381 --> 04:56.426
by the trauma that
you suffered.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.341
Please.

05:01.039 --> 05:04.434
Return to your seat and
fasten your seatbelt.

05:04.478 --> 05:05.305
Now!

05:48.696 --> 05:50.611
Pretty nice?

05:50.654 --> 05:52.874
It's beautiful.

05:52.917 --> 05:55.050
Get used to it
'cause this is home.

05:55.093 --> 05:57.095
For now
at least.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.689
I think we're
gonna be okay here.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.561
Wait, wait, was
that a smile?

06:28.779 --> 06:29.998
Maybe.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.044
Yes.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.351
All right. My
baby is back.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.440
Thank you
for putting up with me.

06:37.484 --> 06:38.746
Are you kidding?

06:38.789 --> 06:40.225
I'd be dead in a
ditch somewhere

06:40.269 --> 06:42.402
if it wasn't
for you.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.491
Well, six months
is a long time

06:44.534 --> 06:46.797
to stand
suicide watch.

06:46.841 --> 06:48.538
Child's play.
I waited in line

06:48.582 --> 06:50.627
for seven hours
once at the DMV.

06:50.671 --> 06:52.194
I judge all
life's hardships

06:52.237 --> 06:56.720
by that experience.
None even come close.

06:56.764 --> 06:59.419
A fresh start
begins now.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.812
New job,
new salary.

07:01.856 --> 07:04.119
New house.

07:04.162 --> 07:07.165
I'm hoping this
distance helps

07:07.209 --> 07:09.559
clear me of
my demons.

07:26.141 --> 07:28.143
Bring it in.

07:36.543 --> 07:39.415
Madame.

07:39.459 --> 07:44.072
Thank you, my friend.
Appreciate it.

07:44.115 --> 07:46.596
Arthur?

07:46.640 --> 07:47.728
Shane?

07:47.771 --> 07:48.990
Yes.

07:49.033 --> 07:52.428
And Julia,
good to see you. Welcome.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.385
Likewise.

07:53.429 --> 07:54.735
Pleasure to
finally meet you.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.171
Welcome to LA.

07:56.214 --> 07:58.565
There she is. What
do you think?

07:58.608 --> 08:00.828
A lot better
in person?

08:00.871 --> 08:02.177
Yeah, sure is.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.613
Your things have
arrived last week.

08:03.657 --> 08:04.919
It's all inside.

08:04.962 --> 08:07.095
You can see your bike is
there, all in one piece.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.009
Yeah.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.227
And my
photographs?

08:09.271 --> 08:11.142
Photographs, all present
and accounted for.

08:11.186 --> 08:13.275
So if you want to go
inside, the online tour

08:13.318 --> 08:15.146
just does not do
this place justice.

08:15.190 --> 08:16.931
You have to see
it in person.

08:16.974 --> 08:19.673
The car, does it come
with the house or..?

08:19.716 --> 08:23.111
Your friend, Robert, he
arranged that for you.

08:23.154 --> 08:27.071
He's, um, he's a
generous guy. Wow.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.464
He bought
us a car?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.118
He bought
youa car.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.294
Perks of the job,
babe. Come on.

08:32.337 --> 08:37.038
No, I-I don't want to
be beholden to him.

08:37.081 --> 08:39.562
This is up to
you. Okay?

08:39.606 --> 08:41.129
We either do
this together

08:41.172 --> 08:42.870
or we don't
do it at all.

08:42.913 --> 08:45.220
So you just
let me know.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.182
Okay.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.010
You sure?

08:53.054 --> 08:54.098
Yeah.

08:54.142 --> 08:55.796
Thank you.
Mwah.

08:55.839 --> 08:58.407
Arthur, we're back.

08:58.450 --> 09:01.018
Yeah, I was worried
there for a second.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.803
What was I
talking about?

09:02.846 --> 09:04.021
Luis...

09:04.065 --> 09:06.110
If you, need
anything done,

09:06.154 --> 09:07.590
if you want
to remodel,

09:07.634 --> 09:09.418
you need something
fixed, he's your man.

09:09.461 --> 09:11.028
I'll get you that
number as soon as I can.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.552
Which reminds me..

09:12.595 --> 09:13.857
there's a banister,
the main banister,

09:13.901 --> 09:15.816
he has not gotten
to that yet.

09:15.859 --> 09:19.602
Guys, this is my
second favorite part..

09:19.646 --> 09:22.605
Let's do it.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.347
Wow.

09:25.390 --> 09:26.740
Come on in.

09:26.783 --> 09:30.613
Well?

09:30.657 --> 09:33.311
Hoo!

09:33.355 --> 09:36.793
Well,
what do you think?

09:36.837 --> 09:38.316
It's big.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.101
It is.

09:40.144 --> 09:42.494
I knew you'd like
it. It's what I do,

09:42.538 --> 09:44.279
I make dreams
come true.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.411
I should put that
on my business card.

09:48.675 --> 09:52.243
Look around.
Feel the space.

09:59.773 --> 10:00.904
They're all there.

10:00.948 --> 10:03.646
There's no broken
glass, no chipped frame.

10:03.690 --> 10:08.129
I like that one, by
the way. It's nice.

10:08.172 --> 10:11.785
Do you know
the family?

10:11.828 --> 10:18.487
It's, um, my mother
and father and me.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.620
Well, if they're ever in
the market for a place

10:20.663 --> 10:22.883
in LA you know who to
bring them to, right?

10:22.926 --> 10:24.928
They passed.

10:24.972 --> 10:30.760
I'm sorry to hear
that. I'm sorry.

10:30.804 --> 10:32.893
Mr. Larkin?
-Yo.

10:32.936 --> 10:34.068
I have the
lease right here.

10:34.111 --> 10:35.678
It's the exact same
wording as the one

10:35.722 --> 10:37.549
you already
approved online, so..

10:37.593 --> 10:39.029
I'd like to,
read it anyway,

10:39.073 --> 10:40.683
if you
don't mind.

10:52.390 --> 10:53.653
All right.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.567
There you go.

10:55.611 --> 10:56.568
Perfect.

10:56.612 --> 10:59.397
And if Ms. McNeil
wouldn't mind?

10:59.441 --> 11:01.748
Jules?

11:01.791 --> 11:05.186
Julia...

11:05.229 --> 11:06.491
Hey.

11:08.102 --> 11:10.713
You need to
sign too.

11:10.757 --> 11:17.198
Sorry. Um, did
you read it?

11:17.241 --> 11:19.853
Yeah. Yeah, the first
couple of paragraphs.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.898
I'm kidding.
I read it.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.247
It's the same
stuff as before:

11:23.291 --> 11:24.422
pay the rent
on time,

11:24.466 --> 11:26.947
don't remove the
load bearing walls,

11:26.990 --> 11:28.470
et cetera,
et cetera.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.690
It's the et cetera, et
cetera that scares me.

11:30.733 --> 11:35.477
Okay, well read it.
We're not in a rush.

11:35.520 --> 11:41.483
Here you go...
Here is a pen.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.541
Right there.
There you are.

12:06.247 --> 12:08.162
Thank you
very much.

12:08.205 --> 12:10.120
I probably shouldn't tell
you this, but there was

12:10.164 --> 12:12.775
another couple vying for
this house and they were

12:12.819 --> 12:14.908
willing to pay quite
a bit more per month,

12:14.951 --> 12:16.474
but I talked to the
management company

12:16.518 --> 12:18.128
and I got
you in.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.347
Why?

12:19.390 --> 12:22.350
They were horrid people.
Absolutely horrid.

12:22.393 --> 12:23.960
They were
rich, but horrid.

12:24.004 --> 12:27.703
And their kids were the
most disgusting little..

12:27.747 --> 12:30.793
Anyway, this-
don't get me started.

12:30.837 --> 12:33.665
This looks great.
We're all set.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.972
Um, there's just
one final thing.

12:36.016 --> 12:40.455
And this is my
favorite part..

12:40.498 --> 12:43.458
Shane.. Julia..

12:47.549 --> 12:49.290
Welcome home.

13:06.655 --> 13:07.874
Hey, hon?

13:07.917 --> 13:09.832
-Just a sec.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.922
Time for
a break?

13:49.437 --> 13:50.612
-What's wrong?

13:50.655 --> 13:51.743
There's a man
in the house!

13:51.787 --> 13:52.657
-What?

13:52.701 --> 13:54.224
He just went
past the door.

13:54.268 --> 13:55.443
-Are you sure?

13:55.486 --> 13:56.487
Yes!

13:56.531 --> 13:57.445
-You're sure?

13:57.488 --> 13:58.489
Yes!

13:58.533 --> 14:02.058
- Stay here.
Stay there.

14:30.695 --> 14:34.438
Jules, come on.
It's okay.

14:38.834 --> 14:40.009
What was it?

14:40.053 --> 14:41.663
That's got to
be what you saw.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.491
Both the doors
are dead bolted.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.671
What if somebody
has a key?

14:49.714 --> 14:52.500
You can only unlock
them from the inside.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.937
I'm sorry.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.635
It's okay. You thought
you saw an intruder.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.289
I'd rather you say
something than have

14:59.333 --> 15:02.031
somebody come in
and chop us to bits.

15:02.075 --> 15:05.034
I'm gonna shower.

15:51.820 --> 15:52.734
Julia?

15:59.045 --> 16:00.829
Julia!

16:05.181 --> 16:06.574
Julia..

16:42.784 --> 16:46.788
It turns out it was a
shadow from a chanlier.

16:46.831 --> 16:50.052
It's okay. We had
sex later that night.

16:50.096 --> 16:53.795
Well, thank you
for that, Shane.

16:53.838 --> 16:57.581
Julia? Julia?

16:57.625 --> 17:00.367
Julia?

17:00.410 --> 17:02.934
Yes?

17:02.978 --> 17:04.848
You called me.

17:04.893 --> 17:08.069
My parents...

17:08.114 --> 17:10.290
Your parents,
or him?

17:10.333 --> 17:12.074
They-they
saw him.

17:12.117 --> 17:14.511
I saw him.

17:14.555 --> 17:16.992
Okay, there is
no him, Julia.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.080
He's on
the video.

17:19.125 --> 17:23.738
You were a child. A
man just happened to be

17:23.781 --> 17:26.435
in the park at the
same time you were.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.568
We met eyes.

17:27.611 --> 17:28.482
And..?

17:28.525 --> 17:30.788
..and he
killed them.

17:30.832 --> 17:33.443
George Fitzgerald,
that's his name.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.141
Or was his name.

17:35.184 --> 17:37.317
The man that was
in that video..

17:37.360 --> 17:39.101
he's long dead.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.755
He died before
your parents-

17:40.798 --> 17:41.930
..were murdered.

17:41.973 --> 17:44.106
No, Julia.

17:44.150 --> 17:49.111
Okay, look around
you, on the walls.

17:49.155 --> 17:53.028
Trust me, Julia.

17:58.773 --> 18:01.471
I'm guessing there is at
least one carbon monoxide

18:01.515 --> 18:05.301
detector in there
with you somewhere?

18:05.345 --> 18:09.697
Your parents made a
terrible mistake, and

18:09.740 --> 18:12.395
it's a miracle that
you are still alive.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.136
Let's talk about your
other symptoms, shall we?

18:14.180 --> 18:17.139
Let's, let's talk
about the delusions.

18:17.183 --> 18:18.749
I suspect that they
will disappear

18:18.793 --> 18:20.186
along with her
other symptoms.

18:20.229 --> 18:21.404
When?

18:21.448 --> 18:23.102
This is Julia's
session, Shane.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.322
When?

18:26.366 --> 18:28.542
A couple of weeks on this
new medication, Julia,

18:28.585 --> 18:30.370
and I think you're
gonna be right as rain.

18:30.413 --> 18:31.762
I'm gonna
hold you to that.

18:31.806 --> 18:32.894
All right,
I'm out.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.070
Goodbye, Shane.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.680
Bye, doc.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.906
Thank you for always
making time for me.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.777
I'm here for you,
day or night.

18:46.821 --> 18:48.301
You know that.

18:48.344 --> 18:49.650
Goodbye, Julia.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.036
Shane?

20:32.231 --> 20:35.538
Hey, Charlie, 
do you suppose JJ is

20:35.582 --> 20:37.497
running around with
that young lady?

20:37.540 --> 20:39.194
-It looks that way.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.501
I-I wonder
what it's like.

20:41.544 --> 20:43.372
What, Grizz?

20:43.416 --> 20:47.071
Well, to be loved by
a young girl like that.

20:47.115 --> 20:49.987
You know, nobody ever
looked at me like that.

20:50.031 --> 20:52.163
Not even when
I was young.

20:52.207 --> 20:54.862
- Yes, when we're
young-

20:54.905 --> 20:56.777
It was either you or
your worthless brother

20:56.820 --> 20:58.344
who was driving
the car that night.

20:58.387 --> 20:59.562
Now who was it?

20:59.606 --> 21:00.955
-Him.

21:00.998 --> 21:03.349
He drinks vodka.
Can't stand scotch.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.046
And there were three
empty bottles of the

21:05.089 --> 21:07.004
cheap stuff in the car
when the cops arrived.

21:07.048 --> 21:10.399
Now tell me ain, who
was behind the wheel?

21:10.443 --> 21:13.184
-I don't remember.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.419
I remember you
were kind once.

21:30.463 --> 21:32.334
You're thinking
of the other girl!

21:32.378 --> 21:35.206
I've never been kind.
I've never been kind,

21:35.250 --> 21:36.904
I've never
been beautiful.

21:36.947 --> 21:40.211
I've been told that since
I was five years old.

22:00.536 --> 22:02.103
You smother a
man long enough

22:02.146 --> 22:04.671
in those two things,
and if a man is a man,

22:04.714 --> 22:06.194
he's either
going to implode

22:06.237 --> 22:08.762
or kick down
walls to escape.

22:08.805 --> 22:12.113
How would you know
what a man does?

22:16.378 --> 22:19.729
And cut!

22:27.389 --> 22:29.696
May I help you?

22:29.739 --> 22:31.262
Yeah. Wardrobe
wants their

22:31.306 --> 22:33.613
"Mafia Kingpin"
outfit back.

22:33.656 --> 22:35.136
Show me the
boy at seven

22:35.179 --> 22:37.268
and I'll show you
the pissant at 30.

22:37.312 --> 22:39.096
Well, I learned
from the best.

22:44.275 --> 22:45.755
How's the house?

22:45.799 --> 22:47.888
It's gonna be
perfect. Thank you.

22:47.931 --> 22:49.629
Good. It's
good to know.

22:49.672 --> 22:51.587
Now we just have
to take care of this

22:51.631 --> 22:52.893
wardrobe problem.

22:54.808 --> 22:57.201
new record to malign
my taste in clothes.

22:57.245 --> 22:58.464
Well, you're an
executive now.

22:58.507 --> 22:59.900
And a well-paid
executive.

22:59.943 --> 23:02.250
Does that mean my
cubby's gonna have A/C?

23:02.293 --> 23:04.644
Cubby? No,
you get an entire wing.

23:04.687 --> 23:06.515
Staff.. assistants...

23:06.559 --> 23:08.256
You even get your
own water cooler.

23:08.299 --> 23:09.562
Ooh!

23:09.605 --> 23:10.998
You also get a hell of a
lot more responsibility.

23:11.041 --> 23:12.173
Robert!

23:12.216 --> 23:14.697
Okay, look,
clean yourself up,

23:14.741 --> 23:16.307
pop by the office
tomorrow 'cause

23:16.351 --> 23:19.180
there's something I have
to show you. Okay?

23:19.223 --> 23:21.051
What's that?

23:27.710 --> 23:29.103
Your future.

23:34.325 --> 23:36.284
Nothing's in
the bathtub.

23:36.327 --> 23:37.938
Not the bathtub,
I said the sink.

23:37.981 --> 23:39.461
Did you look
in the sink?

23:39.505 --> 23:40.854
Nothing's
in the sink.

23:40.897 --> 23:42.464
I checked the sink, the
shower drain, the bowl,

23:42.508 --> 23:44.466
the cabinets, the
closets. Nothing.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.207
There's no snake.

23:51.908 --> 23:53.475
Do you want me to
call animal control?

23:53.519 --> 23:55.434
No.

24:47.442 --> 24:48.748
My gosh,
I'm so sorry.

24:48.791 --> 24:50.793
I didn't mean
to scare you.

24:50.837 --> 24:53.796
Jules? Jules?

24:53.840 --> 24:55.276
Julia?

24:55.319 --> 24:58.409
Were you waiting
for someone else?

24:58.453 --> 25:02.675
No. I.. hi.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.894
It's so
good to see you.

25:04.938 --> 25:08.768
It's so good
to see you too.

25:14.991 --> 25:16.776
Um, the
restaurant's that way.

25:16.819 --> 25:18.429
Yeah, I know. I
just, I saw someone

25:18.473 --> 25:20.431
back there I don't
really want to talk to.

25:20.475 --> 25:21.868
Who was it?

25:21.911 --> 25:24.827
I don't know.

25:28.048 --> 25:30.920
He walks in the boutique
- my boutique -

25:30.964 --> 25:32.922
smelling like
a brewery.

25:32.966 --> 25:35.098
And it's midmorning,
mind you. And then he

25:35.142 --> 25:37.623
proceeds to tell me that
I'm holding him back.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.712
That I'm
holding himback.

25:39.755 --> 25:42.062
Meanwhile, he's 38,
doesn't have a job,

25:42.105 --> 25:44.325
lives with his parents
and writes a blog

25:44.368 --> 25:46.109
about skateboarding.

25:50.157 --> 25:54.378
So, I tell him to beat
it and two minutes later,

25:54.422 --> 25:56.642
Colin Farrell comes
in and tells me

25:56.685 --> 25:58.382
that he just
divorced his wife

25:58.426 --> 26:00.559
and wants to
marry me instead.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.169
And you're
not listening

26:02.212 --> 26:03.910
to a single word
I've been saying.

26:03.953 --> 26:05.085
Yes, I am.

26:05.128 --> 26:06.695
What was I
talking about?

26:06.739 --> 26:11.265
Um..

26:11.308 --> 26:13.006
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

26:13.049 --> 26:16.531
I'm really
distracted today.

26:16.575 --> 26:20.666
Go on, I'm
listening.

26:20.709 --> 26:26.497
Look, um, I'm gonna
tell you something and

26:26.541 --> 26:29.936
I don't want you to take
it the wrong way, okay?

26:29.979 --> 26:33.243
Are you still
seeing things?

26:33.287 --> 26:36.769
Shadow men?
Still?

26:36.812 --> 26:38.988
Let's talk about
something else, can we?

26:39.032 --> 26:42.252
I'm sorry.

26:42.296 --> 26:45.342
I'm sorry, but
I'm concerned.

26:45.386 --> 26:46.779
I'm fine.

26:46.822 --> 26:50.957
I.. honestly,
moving here has been,

26:51.000 --> 26:52.872
it's been
a godsend.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.047
How's Shane?

26:54.090 --> 26:55.744
He's great.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.746
He's, starting
his new job

26:57.790 --> 26:59.835
and he's meeting
his new boss.

26:59.879 --> 27:02.795
I mean, it's his old
boss, but new job,

27:02.838 --> 27:05.711
you know.
So it's good.

27:05.754 --> 27:06.712
Stop.

27:12.239 --> 27:15.459
You, girl, need
to de-stress.

27:15.503 --> 27:18.071
No.

27:18.114 --> 27:21.727
Yes. My
God, yes. Yes.

27:24.773 --> 27:27.123
Can I have the
check, please?

27:30.300 --> 27:31.693
Again.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.699
Feel the stress
melting away?

27:37.743 --> 27:39.222
I think so.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.224
Good. Now
pretend you're

27:41.268 --> 27:44.314
shooting at those
shadow ...

27:44.358 --> 27:47.578
And maybe an ex-boyfriend
from junior year.

28:12.952 --> 28:15.345
I guess this
is what I have

28:15.389 --> 28:16.956
to look
forward to now.

28:18.392 --> 28:20.350
Beautiful views
and shooting guns

28:20.394 --> 28:22.701
and Margaritas.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.964
Welcome
to my so-called life.

28:25.007 --> 28:25.878
Cheers.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.492
I forgot...

28:44.810 --> 28:48.248
Won't cheat on you, lie to
you or break your heart.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.467
Plus, he always puts
the toilet seat down.

28:50.511 --> 28:52.382
He?

28:52.426 --> 28:54.994
I said "so-called"
life for a reason.

28:55.037 --> 28:57.779
Give me your drink.
I'll let you feel him.

29:05.831 --> 29:09.443
Makes you feel
invincible, doesn't it?

29:09.486 --> 29:13.621
You should
get one.

29:13.664 --> 29:15.579
..says Dirty Harry.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.538
I'm serious.

29:24.850 --> 29:28.592
This city may make
you feel alive,

29:28.636 --> 29:30.507
but it can
kill you.

29:45.131 --> 29:46.872
You
look beautiful.

29:46.915 --> 29:48.482
What?

29:48.525 --> 29:50.832
You
look beautiful.

29:50.876 --> 29:53.835
You're biased.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.794
I'm lucky.

30:32.047 --> 30:33.483
Someone's in
the house!

30:33.527 --> 30:34.789
What?

30:34.833 --> 30:36.095
I swear!

30:36.138 --> 30:38.140
The front door
is wide open!

30:38.184 --> 30:39.228
Are you sure?

30:39.272 --> 30:41.100
-Yes!

30:49.325 --> 30:51.937
I-I swear the
front door was open.

30:51.980 --> 30:54.287
The, the
deadbolt's locked.

30:54.330 --> 30:56.593
Do you remember that I
told you the deadbolt

30:56.637 --> 30:58.900
can only be locked
from the inside?

30:58.944 --> 31:01.120
He could be
in the house.

31:01.163 --> 31:02.904
He could have come in
when I went to get you

31:02.948 --> 31:04.427
in the shower.

31:04.471 --> 31:10.651
No, Jules! No.
No more wine.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.522
No, wait!

31:12.566 --> 31:15.525
Dr. Leary told me
not to indulge you.

31:15.569 --> 31:18.050
This conversation
is over, I'm sorry.

31:36.807 --> 31:39.636
Call the police!
Call the police!

31:58.525 --> 32:00.353
I'm Skyping
Dr. Leary.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.925
Wh-what
about dinner?

32:10.667 --> 32:12.147
We thought they
were working,

32:12.191 --> 32:13.714
but they're
obviously not.

32:13.757 --> 32:15.672
She's still
having delusions.

32:15.716 --> 32:17.326
I told you both that it
would take some time

32:17.370 --> 32:19.328
for the medication
to take full effect.

32:19.372 --> 32:20.677
How long?

32:20.721 --> 32:22.331
Well, that's
impossible to say.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.029
Well, what is she
supposed to do

32:24.072 --> 32:25.160
in the meantime?

32:25.204 --> 32:26.727
Chase her delusions
around all day?

32:26.770 --> 32:28.250
She's got
to work.

32:28.294 --> 32:30.774
I can't afford this
place on my salary alone.

32:30.818 --> 32:32.863
I'm not sure why you're
getting mad at me, Shane.

32:32.907 --> 32:34.343
Because you're
her doctor,

32:34.387 --> 32:36.215
you're supposed
to help her.

32:36.258 --> 32:38.173
There's a reason that
she was in my care.

32:38.217 --> 32:40.001
She is light years
from that now

32:40.045 --> 32:42.090
and I'm not letting
her go back. Are you?

32:42.134 --> 32:43.700
No, of course not.

32:43.744 --> 32:46.094
Then let me
do my job.

32:46.138 --> 32:49.750
Julia, I want you to
look at me, please.

32:53.841 --> 32:57.584
Julia?

32:57.627 --> 33:01.631
Okay. These shadow
men are not real.

33:01.675 --> 33:04.286
Deep down, you
know that they're not.

33:04.330 --> 33:05.984
Say so, please.

33:09.335 --> 33:15.036
Julia, say
so, please.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.473
The shadow men
are not real.

33:17.517 --> 33:22.957
You're only
delaying your recovery.

33:23.001 --> 33:26.091
The shadow men
are not real.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.919
Okay, again,
please.

33:28.963 --> 33:33.794
The-the shadow
men are not real.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.812
Robert... So
sorry we're late.

33:51.855 --> 33:53.509
It's okay, Shane.
No problem.

33:53.553 --> 33:56.338
The beautiful and
talented Julia McNeil.

33:56.382 --> 33:58.514
And the talented,
but not so beautiful,

33:58.558 --> 34:00.125
Robert Turner.
My boss.

34:00.168 --> 34:01.126
Pleased to
meet you.

34:01.169 --> 34:02.649
Nice to finally
meet you.

34:02.692 --> 34:04.172
Shane's told me
a lot about you.

34:04.216 --> 34:05.565
Please...

34:05.608 --> 34:08.089
Thank you.

34:08.132 --> 34:13.094
Well, New York is a
particularly brutal city.

34:13.138 --> 34:15.313
I know that
firsthand.

34:15.357 --> 34:17.577
So, well, I'm
thrilled you came..

34:17.620 --> 34:19.056
No, thank you.

34:19.100 --> 34:21.929
I'm thrilled you came
along with Shane,

34:21.972 --> 34:24.670
actually. There's, 
no guarantees, of course,

34:24.714 --> 34:27.543
but with Shane's ability
I'm quite confident that

34:27.587 --> 34:29.806
the both of you are
gonna be just fine.

34:32.373 --> 34:35.812
Did Annie being here
influence your decision?

34:39.293 --> 34:42.123
I'm-I'm so
sorry. I'm sorry.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.647
Shane did mention
her to me once,

34:44.690 --> 34:46.822
mentioned that you
guys were close.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.347
A fellow model,
was it?

34:48.389 --> 34:50.391
Yes, a
fellow ex-model.

34:50.436 --> 34:53.264
We lived in New York
together for three years.

34:53.308 --> 34:55.745
I see. And what
does she do?

34:55.789 --> 34:58.313
She runs a
boutique.

34:58.357 --> 34:59.880
When she's not
drinking excessively

34:59.923 --> 35:01.316
or shooting
guns.

35:03.231 --> 35:04.841
Well, okay.

35:04.885 --> 35:07.105
Congratulations,
by the way.

35:07.148 --> 35:10.151
Shane did mention that
you picked up an agent.

35:10.195 --> 35:11.674
So, cheers
to that.

35:11.718 --> 35:13.241
Hopefully, she-

35:27.647 --> 35:30.650
Jules? Julia?

35:30.693 --> 35:32.130
Are you okay?

35:32.173 --> 35:34.132
Julia?

35:34.175 --> 35:36.525
I'm sorry. I'm gonna
go to the lady's room.

35:36.569 --> 35:37.874
Are you sure
you're all right?

35:37.918 --> 35:39.615
I'm fine.
Excuse me.

35:39.659 --> 35:40.573
Sure.

35:58.330 --> 35:59.244
Where is he?

35:59.287 --> 36:00.549
Ma-am..

36:00.593 --> 36:02.072
He was here
two seconds ago!

36:02.116 --> 36:03.073
Please..

36:03.117 --> 36:04.684
Get off me!

36:04.727 --> 36:06.033
Maître d'!

36:06.076 --> 36:07.687
Miss, please, you
cannot be back here.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.079
Julia..

36:09.123 --> 36:11.125
The man I saw
earlier today was-

36:11.169 --> 36:12.431
he was
right here.

36:12.474 --> 36:13.693
-He wasn't.
Come on.

36:13.736 --> 36:15.129
Okay! Okay!

36:19.089 --> 36:20.090
It's okay.

36:28.098 --> 36:29.099
I'll Skype
Dr. Leary.

36:29.143 --> 36:31.754
No! I don't
need to.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.234
Yeah, you do.

36:33.278 --> 36:39.545
Shane, the man that
I'm seeing is real.

36:39.588 --> 36:42.722
Look at me.
I'm awake,

36:42.765 --> 36:45.855
I-I'm not drunk,
I'm awake.

36:45.899 --> 36:48.554
I'm seeing him. I
saw him twice today.

36:48.597 --> 36:50.817
Maybe more, if he was
the one in this house.

36:55.082 --> 36:57.389
Don't say
it. Stop it.

36:57.432 --> 36:59.260
He cut the power.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.871
There is no
"he", okay?

37:01.915 --> 37:05.092
We blew a fuse,
that's it. Stay there.

37:15.972 --> 37:17.670
Goddammit! Where's
the fuse box?

37:17.713 --> 37:19.106
Is it near the
water heater

37:19.149 --> 37:20.977
or is it in
the garage?

37:21.021 --> 37:22.501
I don't know.
-What?

37:22.544 --> 37:24.459
I don't know!

37:24.503 --> 37:26.635
-Never mind,
I found it.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.879
Julia?

38:36.923 --> 38:38.533
Hi.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.371
Thank you for
seeing me.

38:50.415 --> 38:53.026
I promised.
You all right?

38:53.069 --> 38:56.812
Yeah. I brought you
some of my new work.

38:56.856 --> 39:00.947
Save it. I know
your work. Come.

39:35.198 --> 39:37.070
Like I said,
things are slow.

39:43.903 --> 39:46.427
This is a public
service announcement.

39:46.471 --> 39:48.124
Yeah, it's
union work.

39:48.168 --> 39:49.822
Great.

39:49.865 --> 39:53.434
Um, I know, but I'm a
fashion photographer.

39:53.478 --> 39:54.957
Do you not
want it?

39:57.177 --> 39:59.092
Okay. We've
got 20 other

39:59.135 --> 40:00.920
photographers
I can give it to.

40:00.963 --> 40:03.444
No, I'll take
it. Thank you.

40:07.666 --> 40:11.496
You were hoping
for more. I know.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.541
I'm sorry.

40:26.728 --> 40:27.555
Hi.

40:27.599 --> 40:29.078
-Hey. How'd
it go?

40:32.821 --> 40:35.084
Not great.

40:35.128 --> 40:36.608
What happened?

40:36.651 --> 40:38.871
I thought you
said she owed you?

40:38.914 --> 40:40.438
She did.

40:40.481 --> 40:42.483
-Well, then
what happened?

40:42.527 --> 40:44.920
She gave
me what she had.

40:44.964 --> 40:46.487
Which was what?

40:46.531 --> 40:49.229
A PSA for
orange juice.

40:49.272 --> 40:50.622
- Man.

40:50.665 --> 40:52.841
Are the
Margaritas ready?

40:52.885 --> 40:54.147
Hey!

40:54.190 --> 40:57.280
The water's
off in my house.

40:57.324 --> 40:59.413
I tried to call you,
but you didn't pick up,

40:59.457 --> 41:03.852
so I tried Shane.
Are you all right?

41:03.896 --> 41:06.202
That editor
friend of yours

41:06.246 --> 41:08.291
gave her a
crap assignment.

41:08.335 --> 41:09.815
Are you
kidding me?

41:12.470 --> 41:15.298
The water's off
in your house?

41:15.342 --> 41:16.517
Yeah.

41:16.561 --> 41:18.476
What did she
give you?

41:18.519 --> 41:23.045
Um... a PSA.

41:23.089 --> 41:26.484
Unbelievable. I'm
so sorry, sweetie.

41:26.527 --> 41:28.834
I, asked Annie to
stay for dinner earlier.

41:28.877 --> 41:30.749
Is that
still okay?

41:30.792 --> 41:34.056
If you're not up for it
I totally understand.

41:34.100 --> 41:37.538
No,
it's-it's fine.

41:37.582 --> 41:39.627
I can't believe
she stiffed you.

41:40.933 --> 41:42.848
Do you want a glass
of wine or something?

41:42.891 --> 41:45.894
No.

41:45.938 --> 41:48.201
Where is
the shoot?

41:48.244 --> 41:51.770
Here.

41:51.813 --> 41:55.730
Good. At least
you can get your

41:55.774 --> 41:57.689
studio up
and going.

42:02.781 --> 42:04.870
You sure you don't
mind me staying?

42:04.913 --> 42:06.828
I don't want
to intrude.

42:06.872 --> 42:08.264
It's fine.

42:11.877 --> 42:14.401
Cool. I'll
get dressed.

42:42.342 --> 42:43.952
Would you mind
bringing your glass

42:43.996 --> 42:45.780
a little
closer in?

42:49.218 --> 42:52.874
Erin? Thank you.

42:58.227 --> 43:00.665
It looks great.
Thank you.

43:34.916 --> 43:36.918
Hello?

43:36.962 --> 43:39.007
Yeah, speaking.

43:44.752 --> 43:46.754
Well, you've got a
slight concussion.

43:46.798 --> 43:49.539
We'll release you, but
I want you to stay home

43:49.583 --> 43:51.716
and rest for
a few days.

43:51.759 --> 43:54.980
I'll have the nurse
begin the paperwork.

43:57.417 --> 43:59.680
How are
you feeling?

44:02.814 --> 44:06.600
Hey.. did something
hit it from outside?

44:06.644 --> 44:08.471
No.

44:08.515 --> 44:10.691
Yeah, I bet one of the
models bumped into it

44:10.735 --> 44:12.737
and you didn't
even see it.

44:12.780 --> 44:15.348
Nobody bumped
into it, Shane.

44:15.391 --> 44:18.743
I heard a click like
it was triggered

44:18.786 --> 44:20.309
and it
fell and-

44:20.353 --> 44:24.226
Triggered?
By who?

44:27.882 --> 44:30.189
I have an idea.

44:30.232 --> 44:34.584
Can you
tell me?

44:34.628 --> 44:38.458
I'll tell you when
I'm more certain.

44:42.592 --> 44:44.551
Are you..

44:44.594 --> 44:45.770
Yes!

44:45.813 --> 44:48.250
Yes, I'm taking
my medication!

44:48.294 --> 44:50.731
And yes, it's
the right dose!

44:50.775 --> 44:54.430
Doesn't it look
like it's working?

44:54.474 --> 44:56.694
That's not what I
was going to ask.

44:56.737 --> 45:00.828
I was going to ask if you
were feeling well enough

45:00.872 --> 45:03.962
to go home or if you want
to stay here tonight.

45:04.005 --> 45:05.006
Home.

45:08.140 --> 45:10.403
Do you want to come
over for dinner, drinks,

45:10.446 --> 45:11.839
and sex in
our shower?

45:11.883 --> 45:13.406
Julia!

45:13.449 --> 45:14.886
What is that
supposed to mean?

45:14.929 --> 45:18.063
Jules, what is that
supposed to mean?

45:54.403 --> 45:57.276
Jules?

45:57.319 --> 46:00.018
Do you want to,
Skype Dr. Leary?

46:00.061 --> 46:01.019
No.

46:03.935 --> 46:05.545
All right.

46:14.293 --> 46:16.469
What happened?
What happened?

46:16.512 --> 46:18.732
I just got shocked
by the window frame!

46:18.776 --> 46:19.777
Shocked?

46:19.820 --> 46:21.735
Damn him!

46:21.779 --> 46:23.041
-Damn who?

46:23.084 --> 46:24.651
Who do
you think?

46:24.694 --> 46:26.740
-I have no idea what
you're talking about!

46:26.784 --> 46:30.352
Arthur! The man who
rented us this house!

46:30.396 --> 46:33.094
-What does he have
to do with anything?

46:34.443 --> 46:35.836
Julia?

46:35.880 --> 46:37.969
Julia, put
the phone down.

46:38.012 --> 46:39.797
The number
you have reached

46:39.840 --> 46:41.624
is not in service
at this time.

46:41.668 --> 46:42.974
Of course.

46:43.017 --> 46:44.192
Where are
you going?

46:44.236 --> 46:46.847
-His office. I
don't know why

46:46.891 --> 46:48.544
you can't see
what he's doing!

46:48.588 --> 46:50.938
He's not doing
anything to us!

46:50.982 --> 46:53.985
He's running us out
of this house, Shane.

46:54.028 --> 46:59.599
He had someone willing to
pay so much more money!

46:59.642 --> 47:00.687
Honey...

47:00.730 --> 47:02.602
He got an offer
he couldn't refuse

47:02.645 --> 47:04.560
and he took it.

47:04.604 --> 47:06.301
That's not what's
happening here.

47:06.345 --> 47:07.912
You wanna bet?

47:07.955 --> 47:09.478
-Julia,
don't do this.

47:09.522 --> 47:11.480
This makes sense.

47:11.524 --> 47:13.308
That's not what's
going on here, okay.

47:13.352 --> 47:15.093
That's not
what's happening.

47:15.136 --> 47:18.923
Julia, call Dr. Leary
and Skype her. Julia!

47:42.642 --> 47:44.774
Ma'am? You can't
go in there.

47:44.818 --> 47:46.733
Julia..

47:46.776 --> 47:48.256
Jules!

47:48.300 --> 47:49.562
You got the
spiral staircase,

47:49.605 --> 47:51.129
which you're gonna
absolutely love.

47:51.172 --> 47:52.391
Julia!

47:52.434 --> 47:53.827
..bring your people-

47:53.871 --> 47:56.177
I know what you're doing
and it's not gonna work.

47:56.221 --> 47:57.613
Arthur, I'm sorry.

47:57.657 --> 47:59.050
The men
following me?

47:59.093 --> 48:01.487
The intruders? The
window falling and

48:01.530 --> 48:03.576
hitting me on the
head, by the way.

48:03.619 --> 48:04.446
My, God.

48:04.490 --> 48:05.447
The snake?

48:05.491 --> 48:06.144
Snake?

48:06.187 --> 48:07.058
Snake?

48:07.101 --> 48:08.755
He put a snake
in our sink.

48:08.798 --> 48:10.626
And now a shock
from our window frame.

48:10.670 --> 48:12.193
We signed
a lease.

48:12.237 --> 48:13.847
We're staying
in the house.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.631
Stop trying to
drive us out.

48:15.675 --> 48:17.198
I'm at an
absolute loss.

48:17.242 --> 48:18.678
You've been
wonderful tenants

48:18.721 --> 48:20.245
up until
this point.

48:20.288 --> 48:23.030
We have no intention
of you going anywhere.

48:23.074 --> 48:24.423
We're not
going anywhere.

48:24.466 --> 48:26.381
Unless it's
to the police.

48:26.425 --> 48:28.906
One more thing happens,
I'm filing a report.

48:28.949 --> 48:30.559
A report? What?

48:30.603 --> 48:31.996
Arthur, I'm sorry.

48:32.039 --> 48:33.301
Shane, I-I
don't understand.

48:33.345 --> 48:34.868
Julia, wait! Julia!

48:34.912 --> 48:36.565
Thanks for
supporting me in there.

48:36.609 --> 48:37.827
-Stop. Stop.

48:37.871 --> 48:39.394
Did you see
Arthur's printer?

48:39.438 --> 48:40.221
-What?

48:40.265 --> 48:41.875
Did you see
a printer?

48:41.919 --> 48:43.181
-No!

48:43.224 --> 48:45.748
What kind of office
doesn't have a printer?

48:45.792 --> 48:48.708
He's got a lamp in there
with a tag still on it.

48:48.751 --> 48:51.276
The employees, god
knows who they are.

48:51.319 --> 48:52.930
One of them's
working on a computer

48:52.973 --> 48:54.409
with the
monitor off.

48:54.453 --> 48:56.194
Something is going
on in there and

48:56.237 --> 48:58.283
it's not real estate,
I'll tell you that.

48:58.326 --> 49:00.067
-Look at me.
All right?

49:00.111 --> 49:03.636
Take a deep
breath. Please.

49:03.679 --> 49:07.292
Hey, the snake that
you say that you saw

49:07.335 --> 49:09.729
in the sink, did
anybody else see that?

49:09.772 --> 49:11.296
No.

49:11.339 --> 49:12.688
-Okay.

49:12.732 --> 49:15.822
It was gone by the
time Luis got there,

49:15.865 --> 49:18.129
but I'm telling
you it was there.

49:18.172 --> 49:19.739
And the
shadow men?

49:19.782 --> 49:23.134
The intruders that
nobody else sees.

49:23.177 --> 49:24.570
Don't do
this to me.

49:24.613 --> 49:27.442
I'm telling you that
man I'm seeing is real.

49:27.486 --> 49:28.487
I swear.

49:28.530 --> 49:29.531
He's not!

49:36.277 --> 49:38.366
Maybe it's
the medication.

49:38.410 --> 49:40.542
I've heard that it
can make people worse.

49:43.806 --> 49:47.201
You've been on your old
meds for two months now.

49:47.245 --> 49:49.638
What?

49:49.682 --> 49:52.598
Dr. Leary and I spoke and
we thought it would help.

49:52.641 --> 49:54.295
You thought that was
okay to just do that

49:54.339 --> 49:55.557
and not tell me?

49:55.601 --> 49:57.081
You were better
before, okay,

49:57.124 --> 49:59.735
so we put you on
your old meds. Okay?

49:59.779 --> 50:01.085
Look at me.

50:01.128 --> 50:02.521
Hey, hey.
Look at me!

50:02.564 --> 50:03.783
-No!

50:03.826 --> 50:06.046
Hey. Look, I don't
know about these things

50:06.090 --> 50:08.570
that you're seeing.
I don't, I don't.

50:08.614 --> 50:11.269
Okay, but I know that
I'm real, all right?

50:11.312 --> 50:13.488
Okay? I'm real,
and I love you

50:13.532 --> 50:15.534
and I will do
whatever I can

50:15.577 --> 50:18.493
to help you through
this no matter what.

50:18.537 --> 50:21.409
Maybe we need to talk
to another doctor,

50:21.453 --> 50:22.671
I don't know.

50:22.715 --> 50:24.630
But I need you to
promise me that

50:24.673 --> 50:26.632
you will never do
something like this again.

50:26.675 --> 50:27.589
Please.

50:30.679 --> 50:31.680
Okay?

50:34.422 --> 50:35.771
I promise.

50:35.815 --> 50:37.164
-Okay.

55:42.034 --> 55:44.253
Hello?

55:44.297 --> 55:47.256
Hey, where
are you?

55:49.911 --> 55:52.914
I mean, what do
you want me to say?

55:52.958 --> 55:55.134
I want you
to believe me.

55:55.177 --> 55:57.745
I was inside
that office, Shane.

55:57.789 --> 56:00.313
I saw our house
on those monitors.

56:00.357 --> 56:03.272
Please, come with me
and let me prove to you

56:03.316 --> 56:05.144
this is real.

56:05.187 --> 56:07.755
If not, you can do
whatever you want.

56:34.739 --> 56:36.044
I have to
go to work.

56:36.088 --> 56:37.481
-Just two
more minutes.

56:37.524 --> 56:39.874
You said that
an hour ago.

56:39.918 --> 56:42.399
Come on,
let's go home.

56:42.442 --> 56:43.922
-Here he comes.

56:55.542 --> 56:56.761
Not yet.

57:03.724 --> 57:06.205
You know what? I'm
gonna be right back.

57:06.248 --> 57:07.989
-And if she
doesn't want to go?

57:08.033 --> 57:09.513
Then we go
without her.

57:22.482 --> 57:24.353
Is she in
the back?

57:28.096 --> 57:29.271
Annie...

57:29.315 --> 57:30.708
Can we talk?

57:30.751 --> 57:32.405
I'm busy.

57:32.449 --> 57:36.017
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said that.

57:36.061 --> 57:37.454
But you did.

57:39.543 --> 57:42.937
Can you forgive
me? Please?

57:42.981 --> 57:46.985
Look, I'm hanging
on by a thread here

57:47.028 --> 57:50.858
and I don't know what
I'd do if I lost you.

57:53.078 --> 57:55.515
There's nothing
between Shane and me.

57:55.559 --> 57:56.821
Nothing.

57:56.864 --> 57:58.953
I know.

57:58.997 --> 58:01.521
Jules, you
need help.

58:01.565 --> 58:03.784
And I'm gonna
get it. I promise.

58:03.828 --> 58:07.048
I just need to know
that you forgive me.

58:10.443 --> 58:14.708
Annie, please.
Can you forgive me?

58:14.752 --> 58:16.841
Yes, I
forgive you.

58:23.369 --> 58:25.850
He's beneath the
bathroom sink.

58:25.893 --> 58:29.767
My gift to you.

58:29.810 --> 58:31.725
Won't cheat on
you, lie to you,

58:31.769 --> 58:33.858
or break
your heart.

58:33.901 --> 58:34.989
You did it.

58:35.033 --> 58:36.948
The night I
used your shower.

58:40.734 --> 58:43.128
Can I ask you for
one more thing?

58:46.653 --> 58:48.568
Well, buddy, it's moving
along really quickly.

58:48.612 --> 58:50.570
We just need a few papers
signed, so if you can

58:50.614 --> 58:53.573
come on in and- Josh,
let me call you back.

58:53.617 --> 58:55.096
I know what
you're up to.

58:55.140 --> 58:56.968
Dammit, Julia...

58:57.011 --> 58:58.622
Please.

58:58.665 --> 58:59.971
Jules..

59:00.014 --> 59:01.363
come on.

59:01.407 --> 59:02.800
-These were empty.

59:02.843 --> 59:04.932
Julia, come on. Come
on, that's enough.

59:04.976 --> 59:07.544
No, get off
me! Stop it!

59:07.587 --> 59:09.981
I'm gonna have to call
the police. I'm sorry.

59:11.243 --> 59:12.984
Julia..

59:13.027 --> 59:16.204
I mean..

59:16.248 --> 59:18.990
Jules? Please
listen to me.

59:19.033 --> 59:20.600
You need to
calm down, okay?

59:20.644 --> 59:22.036
We're gonna get
you some help.

59:22.080 --> 59:24.473
Look! This room
has monitors in it.

59:24.517 --> 59:25.997
He has a
key to it.

59:26.040 --> 59:27.999
There's screens
in here. Monitors.

59:28.042 --> 59:29.261
Go look!

59:29.304 --> 59:31.045
It's not locked.
Feel free.

59:31.089 --> 59:32.569
It's the
monitor room,

59:32.612 --> 59:34.788
that's where we
monitor the properties.

59:43.318 --> 59:44.363
What is this?

59:44.406 --> 59:45.625
Each one of
these is a feed

59:45.669 --> 59:46.974
to a property
we manage.

59:47.018 --> 59:48.236
This is how
we monitor it.

59:48.280 --> 59:49.324
It's a security,

59:49.368 --> 59:50.630
it lowers our
insurance rates.

59:50.674 --> 59:52.240
It's very simple,
very normal.

59:52.284 --> 59:54.547
Open that one.

59:54.591 --> 59:56.288
Do it.
Open it.

01:00:00.161 --> 01:00:01.641
This is
yesterday.

01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:03.948
Fast forward it.

01:00:03.991 --> 01:00:05.863
Julia..

01:00:05.906 --> 01:00:06.864
-Go on.

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:11.608
More yesterday.

01:00:11.651 --> 01:00:14.001
Open another one.

01:00:14.045 --> 01:00:15.873
This is ridiculous.
This is-

01:00:15.916 --> 01:00:17.265
Just do it.

01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:18.527
I can't continue
to do this.

01:00:18.571 --> 01:00:19.703
Yes, do it!

01:00:19.746 --> 01:00:21.661
Julia..

01:00:21.705 --> 01:00:23.489
It doesn't make any
sense. I'm sorry.

01:00:23.532 --> 01:00:24.838
Fine, I'll
do it.

01:00:24.882 --> 01:00:26.666
-Jules, come on.

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:30.017
Come on, Jules,
this is going nowhere.

01:00:30.061 --> 01:00:31.149
No, I'm
telling you

01:00:31.192 --> 01:00:34.587
this proves that
they are watching us.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:35.893
It doesn't
prove anything.

01:00:35.936 --> 01:00:36.850
It does!

01:00:36.894 --> 01:00:38.112
There's
nothing there!

01:00:38.156 --> 01:00:39.505
Maybe you're
mistaken.

01:00:39.548 --> 01:00:40.549
I'm not. I'm
not mistaken.

01:00:40.593 --> 01:00:41.899
They're trying
to kill us.

01:00:41.942 --> 01:00:42.900
They are not.

01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:44.510
Calm down,
Jules. Please.

01:00:46.773 --> 01:00:48.688
It's all right.
It's okay.

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:51.996
Good night.

01:00:57.784 --> 01:00:59.177
Julia, come on.
We're leaving.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.569
-I'm telling
the truth.

01:01:00.613 --> 01:01:02.223
I was in that
room last night.

01:01:18.849 --> 01:01:22.983
Just rest. You're
gonna be okay.

01:01:39.565 --> 01:01:41.262
Thank you.

01:01:41.306 --> 01:01:45.266
Hey, I'll be
right back, okay?

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.648
I'm, I'm having
her committed tomorrow.

01:02:19.692 --> 01:02:23.000
Um, I'll come
with you.

01:02:23.043 --> 01:02:25.785
Thank you.

01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:31.617
And, thank you
for forgiving her.

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:34.141
That was not her
talking the other day.

01:02:34.185 --> 01:02:36.230
Besides, I owe
her my life.

01:02:36.274 --> 01:02:39.016
I would never
abandon her.

01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:41.235
What do you mean
you owe her your life?

01:02:41.279 --> 01:02:44.630
She helped me
out in New York.

01:02:44.673 --> 01:02:48.939
Let's just
leave it at that.

01:02:48.982 --> 01:02:50.897
See ya.

01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:58.426
Yeah. Bye.

01:03:14.486 --> 01:03:18.838
Julia.. Julia!

01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:23.712
Look! Look, I told
you that is a cable

01:03:23.756 --> 01:03:25.976
that goes
to a camera.

01:03:26.019 --> 01:03:27.151
Julia, stop.

01:03:27.194 --> 01:03:29.457
Shane, I-I swear
I'm not crazy.

01:03:29.501 --> 01:03:31.677
That goes
to a camera.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:32.983
-Julia, stop.

01:03:33.026 --> 01:03:34.723
It does.
It does.

01:03:34.767 --> 01:03:36.421
Julia, stop!
Stop!

01:03:36.464 --> 01:03:37.814
Go look!

01:03:37.857 --> 01:03:39.337
Look, there's
no camera.

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.861
There's no shadow
men. There's no-

01:03:41.905 --> 01:03:43.341
there's no
conspiracy.

01:03:43.384 --> 01:03:45.517
It goes into the
TV, okay? Look.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.823
It's just the
TV cable.

01:03:46.866 --> 01:03:48.041
No.

01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:49.956
Just come
down, okay.

01:03:54.874 --> 01:03:58.312
Please..
come down.

01:04:10.455 --> 01:04:13.588
No. Who are
you calling?

01:04:13.632 --> 01:04:14.807
I'm calling Robert.

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:16.113
I'm canceling
tonight's shoot.

01:04:16.156 --> 01:04:17.375
I gotta take you
to the hospital.

01:04:17.418 --> 01:04:18.158
No.

01:04:18.202 --> 01:04:19.029
Yes!

01:04:19.072 --> 01:04:20.160
No, please!

01:04:20.204 --> 01:04:25.339
Yes! Just sit down.
Please, sit down.

01:04:25.383 --> 01:04:28.777
Sit down.
Please, please.

01:04:28.821 --> 01:04:32.781
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I promise I'm fine.

01:04:32.825 --> 01:04:34.740
Hey. Hey, hold
on a second.

01:04:34.783 --> 01:04:36.655
Listen to me,

01:04:36.698 --> 01:04:40.180
I'm worried you're
gonna hurt yourself.

01:04:40.224 --> 01:04:41.573
I'm-

01:04:41.616 --> 01:04:43.140
Okay? I'm
worried.

01:04:43.183 --> 01:04:46.143
I'm fine. I
promise. I promise.

01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:47.492
Please, go to
your shoot.

01:04:47.535 --> 01:04:53.237
I just- I want
to go back.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:56.196
I want to go back to
before this house

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.720
and this place
and this life.

01:04:58.764 --> 01:05:02.115
I just-

01:05:02.159 --> 01:05:06.293
You-you... You
said.. you said that

01:05:06.337 --> 01:05:09.122
none of this means
anything without me.

01:05:09.166 --> 01:05:11.211
You meant
that, right?

01:05:11.255 --> 01:05:15.737
Yes. Yes.

01:05:15.781 --> 01:05:22.744
Hey, things are gonna
get better, all right?

01:05:22.788 --> 01:05:26.270
When? When? When?

01:05:26.313 --> 01:05:28.446
Shane?

01:05:28.489 --> 01:05:30.143
Hey, Robert, I'm
gonna give you

01:05:30.187 --> 01:05:31.710
a call back,
all right?

01:05:35.322 --> 01:05:38.586
I gotta tie up a few
loose ends at work

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:44.070
and we are outta
here. Okay?

01:05:44.114 --> 01:05:46.159
We're outta here.
We're outta here.

01:05:46.203 --> 01:05:47.726
All right?

01:05:47.769 --> 01:05:50.685
Hey, I am not gonna
leave you here like this.

01:05:50.729 --> 01:05:52.992
All right, I'm gonna
stay with you tonight.

01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:54.037
No.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.125
-Yes.

01:05:55.168 --> 01:05:57.475
No. No, no,
babe, no.

01:05:57.518 --> 01:05:59.694
You go to your
shoot tonight, okay.

01:05:59.738 --> 01:06:02.697
I promise I'm
fine. I'm fine.

01:06:02.741 --> 01:06:07.311
If I know we're
leaving, I'm fine.

01:06:07.354 --> 01:06:08.442
You promise me?

01:06:08.486 --> 01:06:10.967
I promise.

01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:13.143
You promise me that you
are gonna stay here

01:06:13.186 --> 01:06:14.753
and that you are
gonna call me

01:06:14.796 --> 01:06:16.320
if anything
happens, okay?

01:06:16.363 --> 01:06:20.237
I promise.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.934
I love you.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:24.937
I love you, too.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:28.332
Okay. Okay.

01:09:42.265 --> 01:09:44.745
Hey. Hey,
what's going on?

01:09:44.788 --> 01:09:45.877
I found them.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.921
Found what?

01:09:46.965 --> 01:09:48.184
The cameras.

01:09:48.227 --> 01:09:53.232
They're everywhere.
The air vents...

01:09:53.276 --> 01:09:54.494
The lights...

01:09:54.538 --> 01:09:56.366
You have to
come home, please.

01:09:56.409 --> 01:09:57.932
I have to
show you.

01:10:01.022 --> 01:10:02.285
Can you
hear me?

01:10:02.328 --> 01:10:04.200
Yeah, I can hear you.
I hear you breaking a

01:10:04.243 --> 01:10:06.985
promise that you made to
me an hour ago, Julia!

01:10:07.028 --> 01:10:09.117
No. They're even
in the bathroom.

01:10:09.161 --> 01:10:11.250
Stop it! Skype
Dr. Leary.

01:10:11.294 --> 01:10:12.904
Call Annie.

01:10:22.043 --> 01:10:23.958
Jules?! Julia!

01:11:19.623 --> 01:11:21.581
Don't turn around.

01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:24.497
Give me the password to
your computer system.

01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:25.759
Come on, man.

01:11:28.675 --> 01:11:30.329
You scared the
crap out of me.

01:11:30.373 --> 01:11:31.809
You should be more
careful, Arthur.

01:11:31.852 --> 01:11:33.114
LA's not a
nice city.

01:11:33.158 --> 01:11:34.464
Not with
you in it.

01:11:34.507 --> 01:11:36.117
You ready?

01:11:36.161 --> 01:11:37.380
I'm always ready.

01:11:37.423 --> 01:11:40.426
Good. Let's
make some money.

01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:42.602
Who's the
move-in crew?

01:11:42.646 --> 01:11:46.737
Friends of the boss.
Nothing to worry about.

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:48.695
Well, she's home.

01:11:51.437 --> 01:11:53.831
Good. We've
got 45 people

01:11:53.874 --> 01:11:55.441
paying a million
dollars a pop

01:11:55.485 --> 01:11:57.487
to watch her
be killed.

01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:59.140
Boss just texted.

01:11:59.184 --> 01:12:02.709
Now the episode is a
go, 11:30 pm our time.

01:12:02.753 --> 01:12:05.016
Good. We'll
inform the viewers.

01:12:40.051 --> 01:12:41.052
Okay...

01:12:47.798 --> 01:12:51.192
We are ready.

01:12:51.236 --> 01:12:52.368
We're ready.

01:12:52.411 --> 01:12:53.499
-Cue Paulo.

01:12:53.543 --> 01:12:55.545
Paulo, go to two.

01:13:50.861 --> 01:13:52.384
Locking
exterior doors.

01:13:58.521 --> 01:14:00.218
Killing cell
phone signal.

01:14:01.698 --> 01:14:02.655
Yep.

01:14:18.497 --> 01:14:19.977
This is Julia,

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:22.327
leave me a message and
I'll call you back.

01:16:39.203 --> 01:16:40.204
Julia!

01:16:40.247 --> 01:16:41.640
Shane?

01:16:41.684 --> 01:16:44.034
Are you hurt?
Are you hurt?

01:16:44.077 --> 01:16:45.296
What happened?

01:16:45.339 --> 01:16:46.819
The man that was
following me,

01:16:46.863 --> 01:16:49.779
I-I shot him.

01:16:49.822 --> 01:16:53.957
It's okay. Calm
down. Calm down.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.959
Did you
call 9-11?

01:16:58.526 --> 01:17:01.486
Did you call- did
you call Dr. Leary?

01:17:05.011 --> 01:17:08.841
Did you call
Dr. Leary?

01:17:11.844 --> 01:17:13.890
Julia, talk
to me, okay?

01:17:17.415 --> 01:17:19.504
How does he
know your name?

01:17:19.547 --> 01:17:22.768
Who? Who, baby?

01:17:22.812 --> 01:17:26.293
Him.

01:17:26.337 --> 01:17:30.080
I'm Skyping
Dr. Leary.

01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:47.488
You're pointing
a gun at me?

01:17:47.532 --> 01:17:50.753
You're behind this.

01:17:50.796 --> 01:17:57.673
Julia.. you're not
making any sense, okay?

01:17:57.716 --> 01:18:00.197
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.288
I need you to help me
to help you right now.

01:18:04.331 --> 01:18:08.205
Please, just
put the gun down.

01:18:08.248 --> 01:18:10.598
Julia, please.

01:18:10.642 --> 01:18:12.470
Julia, please
put the gun down.

01:18:17.301 --> 01:18:19.129
I'm done. I love you.
I love you so much,

01:18:19.172 --> 01:18:20.652
but I can't do
this anymore.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:23.481
I don't know how
to help you, Julia.

01:18:23.524 --> 01:18:26.440
I don't know
how to help you.

01:18:30.575 --> 01:18:32.751
I can't do
this anymore.

01:18:32.795 --> 01:18:34.753
Wait...

01:18:36.233 --> 01:18:37.147
I can't-

01:18:42.674 --> 01:18:44.545
That's really good.

01:18:44.589 --> 01:18:45.633
Okay.

01:18:58.559 --> 01:19:04.087
What's wrong?

01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:05.958
Boy, you're
predictable.

01:19:08.439 --> 01:19:11.703
What's
wrong?

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:13.661
It's just a delusion.

01:19:13.705 --> 01:19:17.622
Just another in a
string of bad dreams.

01:19:17.665 --> 01:19:19.058
Why would
you do this?

01:19:19.102 --> 01:19:20.190
Do what?

01:19:20.233 --> 01:19:21.365
Stop it.

01:19:32.202 --> 01:19:36.510
You've been
fun, Julia.

01:19:36.554 --> 01:19:39.122
Not the most
vocal in bed,

01:19:39.165 --> 01:19:42.342
not the most
interesting,

01:19:42.386 --> 01:19:46.216
but you've been fun,
I'll give you that.

01:19:46.259 --> 01:19:47.260
Shane...

01:19:57.357 --> 01:20:02.710
Shane... Tyler..
Andreas...

01:20:02.754 --> 01:20:07.759
..., I've been everybody
from Aaron to Zach.

01:20:28.084 --> 01:20:29.955
There's no
way out, Julia.

01:20:35.656 --> 01:20:37.658
How about a trip
down memory lane

01:20:37.702 --> 01:20:39.356
before we finish?

01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:46.276
Aww..

01:20:46.319 --> 01:20:49.627
"How in the world
did I find you?"

01:20:49.670 --> 01:20:53.065
That's you saying
that, by the way.

01:20:53.109 --> 01:20:58.505
"I feel like the luckiest
girl in the whole world."

01:20:58.549 --> 01:20:59.550
Sweet.

01:21:05.991 --> 01:21:08.167
9-11, what's the
nature of your emergency?

01:21:08.211 --> 01:21:10.300
I see two men with guns
breaking into a building.

01:21:10.343 --> 01:21:13.694
What is your
location?

01:21:13.738 --> 01:21:17.481
"You're so
witty and charming.

01:21:17.524 --> 01:21:20.745
What few friends
I have left

01:21:20.788 --> 01:21:23.182
think you're
amazing."

01:21:23.226 --> 01:21:25.141
Aww, shucks, baby.

01:21:33.062 --> 01:21:38.458
'Cause at the end
of the day.. Jules?

01:21:38.502 --> 01:21:41.984
..just business.

01:21:42.027 --> 01:21:45.552
You signed a
lease, remember?

01:21:45.596 --> 01:21:51.950
You know what they say
about signing a lease.

01:21:51.994 --> 01:21:56.128
Always read
the fine print.

01:22:37.343 --> 01:22:40.999
Specifically,

01:22:41.043 --> 01:22:47.788
Page 14, section
nine, paragraph two.

01:22:47.832 --> 01:22:49.877
"I, the
undersigned"

01:22:49.921 --> 01:22:52.880
- that's you -
"agree to participate

01:22:52.924 --> 01:22:55.274
in the operations of
the property owner

01:22:55.318 --> 01:23:00.279
and its subsidiaries,
at my own risk.

01:23:00.323 --> 01:23:04.457
And hereby release the
property owner from all

01:23:04.501 --> 01:23:09.027
liability in any injury
caused, however grievous,

01:23:09.071 --> 01:23:15.860
up to and
including.. death."

01:23:45.455 --> 01:23:46.804
It's okay.
Hold on.

01:23:46.847 --> 01:23:48.849
He's been in
worse spots.

01:23:48.893 --> 01:23:51.243
Now, listen. This
isn't real, Jules.

01:23:51.287 --> 01:23:54.072
This is just a
delusion. Okay?

01:23:54.116 --> 01:23:56.379
Let's Skype Dr. Leary and
talk about it, all right?

01:23:56.422 --> 01:23:59.686
Jules, I love you.

01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:01.775
I've been under
so much pressure.

01:24:04.169 --> 01:24:07.042
Jules... I would
never hurt you.

01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:15.093
Bleach the system.
Bleach it.

01:24:15.137 --> 01:24:16.790
-I am.

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:32.257
Come in.

01:25:32.301 --> 01:25:34.868
Hello, Heather.

01:25:34.912 --> 01:25:36.218
Hi.

01:25:44.095 --> 01:25:46.402
You're gonna do
just fine out there.

01:25:46.445 --> 01:25:48.099
Don't worry.

01:25:53.017 --> 01:25:54.671
I'll see you out.

01:26:10.774 --> 01:26:12.254
You're gonna
do great.

01:26:12.297 --> 01:26:14.169
And remember, you
can call me any time,

01:26:14.212 --> 01:26:15.257
day or night.

01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:16.475
Heather?

01:26:16.519 --> 01:26:17.868
Yeah.

01:26:17.911 --> 01:26:19.174
Heather Sloan?

01:26:19.217 --> 01:26:20.392
Yes.

01:26:20.436 --> 01:26:22.655
No way...
Josh Harrington.

01:26:22.699 --> 01:26:24.091
We were in fifth
grade together

01:26:24.135 --> 01:26:25.615
at Fletcher
Elementary.

01:26:25.658 --> 01:26:27.660
You look
exactly the same.

01:26:27.704 --> 01:26:31.490
I'm sorry, I, um, I
don't remember you.

01:26:31.534 --> 01:26:34.276
It's been 20
years, so that's okay.

01:26:34.319 --> 01:26:36.626
How
have you been?

01:26:38.541 --> 01:26:39.977
Okay.

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:42.414
Yeah. Wow. Are you
visiting someone?

01:26:46.679 --> 01:26:49.421
Um, my aunt had a
little bit of a meltdown

01:26:49.465 --> 01:26:51.249
the other day so
we brought her here

01:26:51.293 --> 01:26:52.903
to see a
specialist.

01:26:52.946 --> 01:26:54.252
Do you live
around here?

01:26:54.296 --> 01:26:55.514
You need a
ride or anything?

01:26:55.558 --> 01:26:57.037
I'm on my
way out.

01:26:57.081 --> 01:26:59.431
I, um, I have
a bus ticket.

01:26:59.475 --> 01:27:00.824
Where you
headed?

01:27:00.867 --> 01:27:02.608
Bernardsville.

01:27:02.652 --> 01:27:03.914
I live in
Pine Ridge.

01:27:03.957 --> 01:27:05.524
It's like two miles
from Bernardsville.

01:27:05.568 --> 01:27:07.222
I'd be happy to
drop you off.

01:27:11.965 --> 01:27:13.489
It's up to you.

01:27:16.056 --> 01:27:17.710
You know what,
um, how about this.

01:27:17.754 --> 01:27:19.364
Give me your phone
number, I'll give you a

01:27:19.408 --> 01:27:21.148
call and we can grab
a coffee some time.

01:27:21.192 --> 01:27:22.324
I'd love a ride.

01:27:22.367 --> 01:27:23.803
You sure?

01:27:25.979 --> 01:27:27.285
Is that okay?

01:27:27.329 --> 01:27:29.331
It's okay
with me.

01:27:29.374 --> 01:27:32.290
Wow. Let me grab
that for you.

01:27:32.334 --> 01:27:33.378
Thanks.

01:27:38.905 --> 01:27:43.954
Bye. Thank you.

01:27:43.997 --> 01:27:46.173
So what have you
been up to these days?

01:27:46.217 --> 01:27:48.263
You know,
like for work?

01:27:48.306 --> 01:27:50.613
-I haven't
worked in a while.

01:27:50.656 --> 01:27:53.093
Not since my
parents died, actually.

01:27:53.137 --> 01:27:54.791
I'm so sorry.

01:27:54.834 --> 01:27:56.836
-What do
you do?

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:59.622
I managed to get into the
film industry somehow.

01:27:59.665 --> 01:28:02.538
I produce
movies now.
