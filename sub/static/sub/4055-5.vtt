41:48.715 --> 41:51.331
Why cook your family a meal
when a dolly can do it?

41:51.467 --> 41:53.128
Why go on a date?

41:53.261 --> 41:55.217
Why try to get to know someone

41:55.346 --> 41:57.177
when you can pay a dolly
for sex?

41:57.306 --> 42:01.174
In every area of human life,
they are coming between us.

42:01.310 --> 42:04.802
We don't know how to connect
to each other, only to them.

42:04.939 --> 42:08.978
And now we can't even trust them
not to hurt us.

42:09.986 --> 42:12.068
We are stumbling
towards the precipice.

42:12.196 --> 42:14.653
We're racing towards it
willingly,

42:14.782 --> 42:17.945
with a smile on our face
and a dolly's hand in ours!

42:18.077 --> 42:19.942
Yes, we are people!

42:20.079 --> 42:23.037
We are people!
We are people!

42:23.166 --> 42:25.999
ALL: We are people!
We are people!

42:26.127 --> 42:28.038
We are people!

42:30.506 --> 42:32.167
Did you speak to Tobe?

42:35.636 --> 42:37.217
It, um...

42:39.348 --> 42:40.724
It wasn't him.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.181
Uh...

42:50.818 --> 42:52.854
I'd had a few glasses of wine.

42:55.406 --> 42:57.237
I was pissed off with you.

42:58.493 --> 43:01.485
I was mucking about.
|just——

43:03.122 --> 43:05.955
I-I wanted to know
what would happen if...

43:10.254 --> 43:13.963
It was an accident.
Before I knew it, I-I...

43:16.260 --> 43:18.296
Before you knew it, what?

43:20.348 --> 43:21.508
Okay.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.685
-I messed around with Anita.
-Oh!

43:27.814 --> 43:29.930
I'm sorry.

43:30.066 --> 43:33.354
It was stupid, pointless.

43:33.486 --> 43:34.726
It was -- It was nothing.

43:34.862 --> 43:37.649
It was a moment
of complete stupidity.

43:44.789 --> 43:48.077
I knew we were having trouble,
but I never, ever...

43:48.876 --> 43:52.414
...ever had you down as a cheat.

43:52.547 --> 43:54.708
Come -- Come on.

43:54.841 --> 43:56.627
I'm hardly a cheat.

44:00.138 --> 44:01.469
What?

44:01.597 --> 44:03.804
It -- It was a machine.

44:03.933 --> 44:06.424
It's not a person.

44:06.561 --> 44:09.724
Okay, yeah, it's disgust--
I'm disgusting.

44:09.856 --> 44:13.644
But it's a sex toy.
It's not another human being.

44:13.776 --> 44:17.234
She lives in our house.

44:17.363 --> 44:19.945
She looks after our children.

44:20.950 --> 44:24.067
She saved our son's life.

44:24.203 --> 44:28.196
And you're calling her
a sex toy?

44:30.710 --> 44:33.292
You're actually trying
to justify this?

44:34.297 --> 44:36.788
Oh, God.

44:36.924 --> 44:39.836
That's why you were so keen
to get rid of her, isn't it?

44:39.969 --> 44:42.255
Who are you?

44:43.931 --> 44:45.387
Who am I?

44:47.727 --> 44:49.183
Who are you?

44:50.897 --> 44:53.809
And who the fuck is Tom?

44:55.234 --> 44:56.565
LAURA:
Oh, God.

[Sobbing ]

45:00.323 --> 45:01.608
Lor, Lor.

45:03.576 --> 45:05.066
Get out!

45:07.079 --> 45:09.161
Get out!

[Sobbing ]

46:02.176 --> 46:03.507
Who is this man?

46:03.636 --> 46:07.254
That's Professor Edwin Hobb.

46:07.390 --> 46:11.053
He was on David's core team,
too, for the first prototypes.

46:11.185 --> 46:12.550
Was he involved in our creation?

46:13.396 --> 46:15.227
Oh, no, David had a falling-out
with him, too,

46:15.356 --> 46:16.471
just like he did with me.

46:16.607 --> 46:18.313
Not sure about what.

46:18.442 --> 46:20.307
For the last few years...

46:21.737 --> 46:23.193
...he worked alone.

46:24.532 --> 46:27.023
You're breathing fast.

46:27.159 --> 46:29.696
Your pulse is raised.

46:29.829 --> 46:32.241
Your pupils are dilated.
What's wrong?

46:32.373 --> 46:34.705
Just need my meds.

46:34.834 --> 46:36.995
Now you're lying.

46:58.274 --> 46:59.810
[Sighs]

46:59.942 --> 47:01.773
That tech was priceless.

47:01.902 --> 47:04.154
You asked me to destroy it.
Only way to be sure.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.236
Don't whine, Robert.
There are more out there.

47:06.365 --> 47:07.605
-Correct?
-Mm-hmm.

47:07.742 --> 47:10.825
FRANCES: Then there'll be
other opportunities soon.

47:10.953 --> 47:14.571
This means we have
one less thing to worry about.
