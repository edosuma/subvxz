WEBVTT

00:00.405 --> 00:02.885
We found her collapsed.
How serious, Jack?

00:02.951 --> 00:03.949
Serious.

00:03.951 --> 00:06.429
The other night
when you made love to me,

00:06.431 --> 00:08.589
was it on her orders?

00:08.591 --> 00:10.431
Nobody told me to do this.

00:11.951 --> 00:13.229
I never told anyone about us.

00:13.231 --> 00:15.229
Step away from the car.

00:15.231 --> 00:19.231
I've not met anyone I've admired
in that way since. Until now.

00:20.271 --> 00:23.109
Father and Sarah are having
a romantic picnic.

00:23.111 --> 00:25.309
And if he's seeing her,
then he has to understand...

00:25.311 --> 00:26.629
Anna, Mamma knows.

00:26.631 --> 00:29.349
I can't approve
of something so wrong.

00:29.351 --> 00:32.391
All I ask for is time
to make my father understand.

00:33.271 --> 00:34.349
A month.

00:34.351 --> 00:35.589
Would you be kind enough to make

00:35.591 --> 00:37.991
a telephone call for me -
long distance?

00:41.791 --> 00:43.471
What's wrong?

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

01:56.071 --> 01:57.471
I was nervous you wouldn't be here.

01:58.751 --> 02:00.711
There was no possibility of that.

03:30.031 --> 03:31.511
What is it?

03:33.791 --> 03:37.151
I was just thinking about
the first day you brought me here.

03:37.991 --> 03:39.911
The night I fell asleep in this bed.

03:41.871 --> 03:44.231
This is the last thing
I thought would happen.

03:45.631 --> 03:46.949
Well, I knew I wanted it.

03:46.951 --> 03:49.149
Yes.

03:49.151 --> 03:51.631
From the moment I took you
in my arms to dance.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.831
What was your first impression?

04:00.231 --> 04:01.711
I thought you were lovely.

04:03.391 --> 04:05.111
Strong.

04:06.151 --> 04:08.071
Lonely.

04:11.231 --> 04:12.511
I was.

04:13.431 --> 04:14.631
And now?

04:15.631 --> 04:17.111
No.

04:18.951 --> 04:20.471
Good.

04:25.791 --> 04:27.551
What did you think?

04:33.031 --> 04:35.711
I noticed your eyes first.

04:37.791 --> 04:39.711
And then your smile.

04:41.751 --> 04:43.431
And then your mother.

04:44.791 --> 04:46.591
And she noticed me noticing.

04:49.791 --> 04:51.509
Perhaps she feared that

04:51.511 --> 04:53.749
more than anything
you had to reveal about James.

04:53.751 --> 04:55.151
She had reason to.

04:58.751 --> 05:01.229
Here we are.

05:01.231 --> 05:02.791
Mmm.

05:17.431 --> 05:19.829
When can I see you again?
Tomorrow at the christening.

05:19.831 --> 05:21.871
Church wasn't really
what I had in mind.

05:22.871 --> 05:25.031
As soon as possible.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.669
What is it?

05:31.671 --> 05:33.311
I worry what I can give you.

05:35.671 --> 05:36.829
This is enough.

05:36.831 --> 05:38.711
We'll live for what it is.

05:39.711 --> 05:41.431
Don't worry about what it can't be.

06:34.391 --> 06:36.469
I'm off, unless you need anything?

06:36.471 --> 06:38.911
Not a thing. Thank you.

06:39.671 --> 06:41.949
Did something happen to Elizabeth?

06:41.951 --> 06:43.429
Such as?

06:43.431 --> 06:46.791
I don't know. Good news? She smiled
at me when I was in the next ward.

06:47.871 --> 06:48.869
Probably gas.

06:48.871 --> 06:51.669
More cat that ate the cream.

06:51.671 --> 06:53.749
I'm feeling I'm definitely
missing something.

06:53.751 --> 06:55.909
I can't help. Sorry.

06:55.911 --> 06:57.589
Alright.

06:57.591 --> 06:59.631
The rest must be doing her good.

07:00.631 --> 07:01.629
That much good?

07:01.631 --> 07:02.951
We can but hope.

07:03.911 --> 07:06.231
I'll see you tomorrow.
Goodnight.

07:16.551 --> 07:17.669
Dinner?

07:17.671 --> 07:19.231
Soon.

07:20.271 --> 07:25.189
Do you remember this day
at the beach with Mother?

07:25.191 --> 07:26.829
Are you feeling sentimental?

07:26.831 --> 07:28.869
Must be Grandmother being sick.

07:28.871 --> 07:30.111
Well?

07:31.151 --> 07:34.149
Your mother had just taken you
in the ocean for the first time.

07:34.151 --> 07:38.231
And from the moment she did,
you started laughing.

07:42.271 --> 07:43.351
Do you still miss her?

07:44.351 --> 07:46.231
Always.

07:47.471 --> 07:50.349
You know that we'd understand
if you found someone else.

07:50.351 --> 07:52.749
What makes you say that?

07:52.751 --> 07:55.909
Just felt like
the right thing to say.

07:55.911 --> 07:58.589
You deserve to be happy.

07:58.591 --> 08:00.589
I am happy.

08:00.591 --> 08:02.551
Well, you shouldn't be alone
forever.

08:05.671 --> 08:07.311
I best freshen up.

08:10.311 --> 08:13.551
I'm sure she'd want you
to fall in love again.

08:36.711 --> 08:38.389
It's early.

08:38.390 --> 08:39.871
Sleep.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.511
James!

09:09.471 --> 09:12.191
Anna! Anna!

09:15.271 --> 09:17.309
The baby moved.

09:17.311 --> 09:18.869
What?

09:18.871 --> 09:22.711
Feel. There. There, can you feel it?

09:26.231 --> 09:29.029
Oh.

09:29.031 --> 09:30.589
Oh, my.

09:30.591 --> 09:32.509
James had gone
but I had to share it.

09:32.511 --> 09:34.671
There it is again. Livvy.

09:35.751 --> 09:39.591
New life... in your tummy.

09:41.391 --> 09:43.071
Oh!

09:44.311 --> 09:46.269
Sorry to interrupt. Clancy.

09:46.271 --> 09:48.429
Good morning, sir.
You're up and about early.

09:48.431 --> 09:51.029
That timber sitting out there.
Are there any plans for it?

09:51.031 --> 09:52.949
Not that I know of.
No, sir.

09:52.951 --> 09:54.389
Why? Thanks, Clancy.

09:54.391 --> 09:56.109
I thought the Walkers could use it.

09:56.111 --> 09:57.989
Harry's fixing
some white ant damage.

09:57.991 --> 10:00.271
It's theirs. What's he like now?

10:01.471 --> 10:02.509
Harry?

10:02.511 --> 10:05.349
Yeah, he was a promising lad.
Has he grown up well?

10:05.351 --> 10:07.309
Yeah, seems to have.
Good.

10:07.311 --> 10:09.869
Oh, I'll see for myself I imagine.

10:09.871 --> 10:11.109
At the christening.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.629
Yeah.

10:12.631 --> 10:16.229
Ah, James, thanks for keeping
an eye out for Amy.

10:16.231 --> 10:18.269
Grandmother asked me to.

10:18.271 --> 10:20.031
Still, good man.

10:39.191 --> 10:40.829
Big day, I hear.

10:40.831 --> 10:43.829
Dousin' the bub's noggin.
What have you got there?

10:43.831 --> 10:46.431
I thought you could use it
for the shed.

10:47.471 --> 10:48.749
That's a lot of timber.

10:48.751 --> 10:50.151
It was going to waste where it was.

10:52.391 --> 10:54.831
I'll give you a hand.
No, no, I can manage.

10:57.431 --> 10:59.389
I could help you rebuild
if you like.

10:59.391 --> 11:02.311
It's a big job
and I've got the time.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.391
I owe you one.
No.

11:08.951 --> 11:11.151
I owe you for the way I behaved.

11:12.271 --> 11:14.309
I understand.
No.

11:14.311 --> 11:15.991
It was no way to treat a friend.

11:20.111 --> 11:22.271
Tomorrow morning?
Sooner the better.

11:26.071 --> 11:28.749
Friends. Just friends.

11:28.751 --> 11:30.711
Yeah.

11:40.191 --> 11:41.949
They're just getting Eve
into a wheelchair.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.949
Yeah, we're late.
Won't be a tick.

11:43.951 --> 11:45.671
Bloody hope not.
Language, hey?

11:48.351 --> 11:50.711
Eve's brother and sister must be
excited to be godparents.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.909
Uh, yeah, better than Bligh
and that bitch.

11:54.911 --> 11:56.349
What did I just say?

11:56.351 --> 11:59.711
That'd be right. Sticking up for
them, of course you would.

12:00.951 --> 12:03.309
Come down the operating room, I'll
cut that chip off your shoulder.

12:03.311 --> 12:05.829
Bloody smart-arse.

12:05.831 --> 12:08.109
Out.
What?

12:08.111 --> 12:09.111
I warned you.

12:10.351 --> 12:11.911
I mean it.
We'll bring Eve out to you.

12:12.911 --> 12:14.189
You're as bad as each other.

12:14.191 --> 12:16.831
Always everybody else's fault,
isn't it?

12:18.391 --> 12:20.951
You're welcome any time you can keep
a civil tongue in your head.

12:35.471 --> 12:37.229
We're sorry to hear
about your husband.

12:37.231 --> 12:39.509
Poor Charles. So sudden.

12:39.511 --> 12:41.431
This is her.

12:42.551 --> 12:47.111
No stress, remember. And see if you
can get her outside into the sun.

12:50.591 --> 12:52.431
Come.

12:55.551 --> 12:59.951
Regina, dear. Oh, thank you
for coming so quickly.

13:11.736 --> 13:14.856
Thank you, dear. You sit.

13:19.167 --> 13:21.845
No sooner do I call
than you're here.

13:21.847 --> 13:23.447
So kind.

13:25.124 --> 13:28.444
I have a confession to make.
I hope you won't think less of me.

13:29.484 --> 13:32.964
I didn't ask you to come
for purely selfless reasons.

13:34.844 --> 13:37.602
George is on the precipice
of a folly.

13:37.604 --> 13:39.644
A woman?

13:40.804 --> 13:44.204
If your sister was a rose,
this one is a bramble taking root.

13:46.244 --> 13:48.602
A nurse here.

13:48.604 --> 13:50.444
Sarah Adams.

13:51.484 --> 13:52.804
A gold-digger?

13:53.924 --> 13:56.722
No, to be fair, but...

13:56.724 --> 13:58.722
her background is unclear

13:58.724 --> 14:00.682
and her attitudes disruptive.

14:00.684 --> 14:03.322
A Jew.
Oh.

14:03.324 --> 14:05.762
I seem unable to prevent it.

14:05.764 --> 14:08.842
If he won't take your advice,
he'll hardly take mine.

14:08.844 --> 14:11.282
It would be such
a weight off my mind

14:11.284 --> 14:14.162
if you were to stay at Ash Park
until I've recovered

14:14.164 --> 14:16.362
as a steadying presence.

14:16.364 --> 14:20.324
You could take in
the lie of the land for me.

14:21.564 --> 14:23.522
You make me sound like...

14:23.524 --> 14:26.162
A spy?

14:26.164 --> 14:27.564
No, no, no. More an ally.

14:28.884 --> 14:31.404
In guarding the coop from the fox.

14:36.924 --> 14:39.202
I've been waiting for you.
What's wrong?

14:39.204 --> 14:42.484
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.
Everything is wonderful.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.564
Feel. There.

14:47.764 --> 14:49.404
You missed it.

14:50.604 --> 14:52.442
The tiniest movement

14:52.444 --> 14:55.844
and all the terrible feelings
just went away.

14:57.284 --> 14:59.484
I'm sorry for how I've been.

15:03.204 --> 15:05.322
There it is.

15:05.324 --> 15:06.844
Our child.

15:13.924 --> 15:18.482
In the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

15:18.484 --> 15:22.602
Regard, we beseech thee, the
supplications of thy congregation,

15:22.604 --> 15:26.722
sanctify this water for
the mystical washing away of sins,

15:26.724 --> 15:31.602
and grant that this child,
now to be baptised therein,

15:31.604 --> 15:36.242
may ever remain a member
of thy faith and children elect.

15:36.244 --> 15:39.404
In the name of Jesus Christ,
our Lord.

15:43.724 --> 15:45.242
Name this child.

15:45.244 --> 15:48.124
Louise Sarah Walker.

15:49.964 --> 15:55.002
Louise Sarah, I baptise thee
in the name of the Father

15:55.004 --> 15:58.362
and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost.

15:58.364 --> 16:01.484
- Amen.
- Amen.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.962
While I would love the company...
Yes?

16:14.964 --> 16:17.244
I'm terribly like Elaine.

16:18.484 --> 16:19.922
I don't see why that's...

16:19.924 --> 16:23.322
No-one likes a reminder of
their dead wife hovering around.

16:23.324 --> 16:28.282
Regina, it's your similarity to
Elaine that may well save him.

16:28.284 --> 16:30.682
A reminder of the gold he lost

16:30.684 --> 16:35.562
may, I hope, make him see
the dross he's contemplating.

16:35.564 --> 16:38.122
Oh, go to the house.

16:38.124 --> 16:39.282
Do sadden him.

16:39.284 --> 16:43.924
Do whatever you can...
to break this woman's hold.

16:51.764 --> 16:53.962
Louise was Bert's mum
and he lost her young

16:53.964 --> 16:55.442
so he wanted to name her first.

16:55.444 --> 16:58.882
Please, Eve, I understand.
She's so sweet.

16:58.884 --> 17:02.442
Are you ready?
Just saying my goodbyes.

17:02.444 --> 17:04.561
Thank you again, both of you.

17:04.564 --> 17:06.242
You're more than welcome.

17:06.243 --> 17:09.561
Congratulations, Bert.
Let's go.

17:09.564 --> 17:11.122
Col, did you wanna go home
or come with us?

17:11.124 --> 17:12.122
Home.

17:12.124 --> 17:14.561
You'll get a clip around the lughole
you're not careful, mate.

17:14.564 --> 17:16.122
Leave him be.
Did anyone ask you?

17:16.124 --> 17:18.762
George can drop Eve and Louise
back at the hospital if it helps.

17:18.763 --> 17:20.762
I can drive my own kid.
She's just being nice.

17:20.763 --> 17:22.402
Yeah, everyone's being real nice.

17:22.404 --> 17:23.882
Come on.

17:23.884 --> 17:27.243
Dad's gonna get his little girl
back to her warm crib, isn't he?

17:29.564 --> 17:31.162
It breaks my heart.

17:31.164 --> 17:33.042
Come on, Col.

17:33.044 --> 17:35.162
She'll marry him over my dead body.

17:35.164 --> 17:38.482
Harry, if you're looking for work
once Eve's home, let me know.

17:38.484 --> 17:41.204
I will.
James spoke well of you.

17:48.084 --> 17:51.044
Yesterday was wonderful.
It was.

17:52.444 --> 17:53.922
Are you free now?

17:53.924 --> 17:55.644
I have to go to work.
Later?

17:57.044 --> 18:00.242
What about tomorrow before work?
I'll drive you in.

18:00.244 --> 18:02.684
Six o'clock?
That's perfect.

18:03.964 --> 18:07.922
I should go before we do something
to create a scandal.

18:07.924 --> 18:09.404
That sounds wise.

18:23.804 --> 18:24.882
When do you head back?

18:24.884 --> 18:27.442
I'll be staying at least
for the weekend.

18:27.444 --> 18:29.722
You and Elizabeth were having
a pretty serious mag.

18:29.724 --> 18:31.844
So many things to catch up on.

18:32.964 --> 18:35.282
Something worth thinking about -

18:35.284 --> 18:38.722
tensions at Ash Park helped put
Elizabeth in that bed.

18:38.724 --> 18:41.442
Every family has
its ups and downs.

18:41.444 --> 18:46.362
Right. Well, she has a way of roping
people into her schemes.

18:46.364 --> 18:48.044
I am not easily lassoed.

18:49.764 --> 18:52.002
I was an ambassador's wife, Doctor.

18:52.004 --> 18:55.842
Berlin, 1938, a dreadful little man
with a laughable moustache

18:55.844 --> 18:57.684
tried to win me over at dinner.

18:58.844 --> 19:00.922
If I can resist Herr Hitler's wiles,

19:00.924 --> 19:04.204
I am quite capable of handling
a sweetheart like Elizabeth.

19:06.244 --> 19:08.284
But I do appreciate the concern.

19:33.811 --> 19:37.091
A right royal welcome.
Regina.

19:37.193 --> 19:39.013
Thank you for having me
at such short notice.

19:39.041 --> 19:41.079
I was delighted when I heard.
The bags to the grey room.

19:41.081 --> 19:43.999
Thank you, Norman.
Your favourite, from memory?

19:44.001 --> 19:47.879
James. What a handsome devil
you've become!

19:47.881 --> 19:50.639
Aunt Reggie.
And you must be Olivia.

19:50.641 --> 19:52.679
A pleasure to meet you finally.

19:52.681 --> 19:55.839
Oh, handshakes are for strangers.
Mwah. Mwah.

19:55.841 --> 19:57.959
We're going to be great friends.

19:57.961 --> 20:00.159
I also hear congratulations
are in order.

20:00.161 --> 20:02.641
Yes.
The first of many, I hope.

20:03.801 --> 20:05.281
Darling girl.

20:07.001 --> 20:09.719
You've grown up.
Who said you could do that?

20:09.721 --> 20:12.399
Well, certainly not my father.

20:12.401 --> 20:14.479
You're definitely
your mother's daughter.

20:14.481 --> 20:17.239
To the teeth. Perhaps you'd like
to freshen up before dinner?

20:17.241 --> 20:18.719
You read my mind.

20:18.721 --> 20:21.799
I have some happy news for you.
Later.

20:21.801 --> 20:23.279
That's not fair.

20:23.281 --> 20:25.479
Well, let's just say if you're
not engaged to the perfect man

20:25.481 --> 20:28.321
by the end of the summer, I'll
forget about dinner and eat my hat.

20:36.801 --> 20:38.719
Isn't that what
you employ nurses for?

20:38.721 --> 20:40.321
You're getting the personal touch.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.121
You are dying to ask.

20:44.361 --> 20:45.399
Am I that obvious?

20:45.401 --> 20:48.301
Well, this is the third excuse
you've made to come in

20:48.360 --> 20:49.918
since she left.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.358
Why Regina?

20:51.360 --> 20:52.880
Yes.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.358
You badger me
about reducing stress,

20:56.360 --> 20:59.798
and then when I try to do something
about it, you suspect my motives.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.080
I'm just curious.
No, suspicious.

21:03.480 --> 21:07.158
I am not trying to control
from a distance.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.038
Aren't you?

21:09.040 --> 21:10.838
A house needs to be run.

21:10.840 --> 21:15.520
Anna is a child, Olivia is
expecting, and Regina's available.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.240
I always got the feeling
you didn't quite approve of her.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.278
Why would that be?

21:22.280 --> 21:24.878
Oh, something in the way
you said 'dear'

21:24.880 --> 21:28.120
whenever you talked
about dear Regina.

21:29.400 --> 21:33.320
Well, she is not without her faults
but... are any of us?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.398
The main thing is
I can happily submit

21:40.400 --> 21:42.478
to my doctor's orders
now that she's here.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.920
It's a winning situation all round.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.918
Her timing is terrible.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.598
How long is she here for?

21:56.600 --> 21:59.518
The weekend, she says, but I know
she's going to stay longer.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.798
But... you like her, yes?

22:01.800 --> 22:05.398
She's fun.
So have fun.

22:05.400 --> 22:10.278
But the more Father wants Sarah,
the more he'll understand us.

22:10.280 --> 22:12.718
And Aunt Reggie will
get in the way of all that.

22:12.720 --> 22:15.438
There's plenty of time
for all that after.

22:15.440 --> 22:16.920
There's more.

22:18.240 --> 22:22.278
She started hinting
about Andrew Swanson.

22:22.280 --> 22:24.720
She wants to marry me off.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.000
She's got to go.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.558
The wine is delicious.

22:36.560 --> 22:39.518
Are you sure it's alright
my sitting here?

22:39.520 --> 22:40.998
Mother would want you to.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.118
When Grandmother sits there,
it's a throne.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.238
When you sit there, it's a chair.

22:45.240 --> 22:48.720
When was the last time
we were all here together?

22:49.720 --> 22:51.478
Just before I left
for Oxford, I think.

22:51.480 --> 22:55.918
You're right. Four years. Charles
had just been appointed to India.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.958
I would love to see India.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.518
Fascinating and abhorrent.

23:00.520 --> 23:03.598
I had a picture book
as a little girl

23:03.600 --> 23:07.438
with a swami clambering up a rope
and disappearing.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.238
The Indian rope trick.

23:09.240 --> 23:12.318
I never saw it but I know
those who did and were amazed.

23:12.320 --> 23:15.680
"There are more things
in heaven and earth, Horatio..."

23:19.200 --> 23:20.880
You're very quiet, my darling.

23:21.880 --> 23:23.758
Oh, no, I'm just listening.

23:23.760 --> 23:26.678
I hope you're not planning
to rush off.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.478
I meant what I said earlier.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.998
But there must be
so many exciting things

23:31.000 --> 23:32.718
to do in the city at this time.

23:32.720 --> 23:35.718
For a woman just out of mourning,
no.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.238
Of course, I... I don't want to
impose.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.438
You would never be an imposition.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.758
Livvy would love the company.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.518
We all would.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.838
It's settled.

23:46.840 --> 23:50.280
Well... it seems it is.

23:53.920 --> 23:56.880
May I join you?
Of course.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.560
I took the liberty.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.318
You were always a whisky straight
man, if my memory doesn't betray me.

24:04.320 --> 24:05.880
Through and through.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.478
I hope I haven't brought up
sad thoughts.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.118
Not at all.

24:14.120 --> 24:17.598
I know my similarity to Elaine
has been difficult for you.

24:17.600 --> 24:21.160
It was once.
And now?

24:22.760 --> 24:26.198
The pain of losing her... has dimmed.

24:26.200 --> 24:30.960
Thankfully, the joy
of having her... never will.

24:32.960 --> 24:35.040
What a beautiful thing to say.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.318
I always envied you both.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.680
Charles and I were hardly
a love match.

24:47.040 --> 24:50.480
But I envy those
who have lived a grand passion.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.480
You are still a very young woman.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.998
Perhaps one day.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.198
I hope so.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.840
In time.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.160
I love you, Sarah.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.960
I love you too.

26:44.412 --> 26:46.772
He must be wondering.
Only if we look guilty.

26:47.397 --> 26:48.637
I'm too old to blush.

26:50.090 --> 26:53.050
Jack.
Ran across Sarah on my way here.

26:53.230 --> 26:54.448
Early for you?

26:54.450 --> 26:56.750
Got a busy day. I thought I'd get
my visiting out of the way.

26:56.785 --> 26:58.383
My legs are the beneficiary.
Thank you.

26:58.385 --> 26:59.743
Glad to be of service.

26:59.745 --> 27:01.225
He's not the only one
with a busy day.

27:09.465 --> 27:10.983
Thank you.

27:10.985 --> 27:12.543
She heard I was ill.

27:12.545 --> 27:15.863
She hurried straight down.
Such a lovely surprise.

27:15.865 --> 27:17.663
How did she find out?

27:17.665 --> 27:20.263
Prudence Swanson.
Are they friends?

27:20.265 --> 27:23.543
Obviously. Never mind
the whys and wherefores.

27:23.545 --> 27:25.903
The fact is she's here.

27:25.905 --> 27:28.663
I've told her she can stay
as long as she likes.

27:28.665 --> 27:30.305
That's lovely.

27:32.145 --> 27:33.745
It's just the tonic we all need.

27:37.465 --> 27:39.783
If you'll excuse me.
Of course.

27:39.785 --> 27:43.343
It will give us a lovely chance
to chat a deux.

27:43.345 --> 27:44.825
I'll see you later, darling.

27:47.265 --> 27:50.225
You're glowing.
Am I?

27:52.185 --> 27:55.985
Elizabeth mentioned
there have been difficulties.

27:57.225 --> 27:58.463
What did she say?

27:58.465 --> 28:01.303
Simply that.

28:01.305 --> 28:02.823
As you can see...

28:02.825 --> 28:05.025
She was talking of you and her.

28:07.065 --> 28:08.663
Don't shoot the messenger.

28:08.665 --> 28:12.665
But she did ask me to find a private
moment to say she'd like to see you.

28:15.425 --> 28:18.145
I've upset you.
It's not your fault.

28:18.423 --> 28:21.383
She's not an easy woman.
I understand.

28:22.743 --> 28:24.583
I don't think you do.

28:28.223 --> 28:32.301
Well, I've done my duty by her.

28:32.303 --> 28:36.063
I'm not here to badger.
The rest is up to you.

28:44.703 --> 28:46.661
My dear, how nice to see you.

28:46.663 --> 28:48.903
Regina gave me your message.

28:50.943 --> 28:53.981
I'm glad it had its effect.
No.

28:53.983 --> 28:56.143
I couldn't come before now.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.983
I was wishing you dead.

29:01.343 --> 29:02.661
I see.

29:02.663 --> 29:07.263
I don't like... what you've made me.

29:08.303 --> 29:10.503
I'm sure you think that's unfair.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.663
If that's where you apportion
the blame.

29:15.783 --> 29:18.981
As I said to James,
if seeing me as the villain

29:18.983 --> 29:23.223
helps you to love him,
then hate me.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.983
The baby moved yesterday.

29:35.543 --> 29:37.903
It helped me do this.

29:40.743 --> 29:43.223
My dear, I can't think
of a more wonderful reason.

29:44.423 --> 29:48.861
The sort of thoughts I was having,
the feelings,

29:48.863 --> 29:50.981
they can't be good for the baby.

29:50.983 --> 29:52.901
I imagine not.

29:52.903 --> 29:56.101
So I won't come again.

29:56.103 --> 30:01.221
I just had to say that time apart
will be good for all of us.

30:01.223 --> 30:03.503
Then that's what you must have.

30:06.023 --> 30:07.543
Go home.

30:08.583 --> 30:10.421
Go home and love James.

30:10.423 --> 30:12.023
Love your husband.

30:13.343 --> 30:14.823
You and I can wait.

30:40.383 --> 30:42.581
I intend to play the fakir
while I'm here.

30:42.583 --> 30:44.941
Troubles and cares up the rope
and out of sight.

30:44.943 --> 30:47.943
The Inverness rope trick?
Exactly.

30:50.423 --> 30:52.301
Ah, there you are.

30:52.303 --> 30:55.621
Regina said you missed breakfast.
I'm fine now.

30:55.623 --> 30:58.661
You wouldn't be offended
if I went to the city, would you?

30:58.663 --> 31:00.341
Of course she would.

31:00.343 --> 31:01.903
Well, it's because of what you said.

31:02.983 --> 31:05.781
We girls have been conspiring.
May I?

31:05.783 --> 31:06.941
Of course.

31:06.943 --> 31:09.661
Young Miss and Andrew Swanson
rather hit it off

31:09.663 --> 31:10.821
according to Prudence.

31:10.823 --> 31:12.541
That's not the impression I got.

31:12.543 --> 31:15.141
Oh, you men.

31:15.143 --> 31:18.181
I suggested it was time
Anna gave him some encouragement.

31:18.183 --> 31:19.783
And you're right.

31:21.703 --> 31:24.141
I think I should go up there,
run across him,

31:24.143 --> 31:26.021
flash him a smile or two.

31:26.023 --> 31:28.261
I didn't think you were interested.

31:28.263 --> 31:31.861
There's what a woman says, George,
and what a woman thinks.

31:31.863 --> 31:36.421
Hmm. I'm not rushing into anything,
I'm just keeping him on the hook.

31:36.423 --> 31:38.181
So you don't mind?

31:38.183 --> 31:40.343
I'm thrilled to have helped.

31:53.423 --> 31:55.341
Take your shirt off.

31:55.343 --> 31:58.981
I'm fine, thanks.
What do you think I'm gonna do?

31:58.983 --> 32:00.541
It's not that.

32:00.543 --> 32:02.941
Nothing's gonna happen
you don't want to happen.

32:02.943 --> 32:05.743
Nothing will happen.
There you go then.

32:23.743 --> 32:25.103
You are not welcome.

32:26.063 --> 32:28.181
Stop.

32:28.183 --> 32:29.661
It's not your place to say.

32:29.663 --> 32:32.661
- What?
- I'll go when Eve tells me to.

32:32.663 --> 32:34.501
OK, I'm delivering
the message for her, yeah.

32:34.503 --> 32:35.741
From her mouth.

32:35.743 --> 32:39.621
She might be stupid enough
to forgive you. I'm not.

32:39.623 --> 32:42.781
You watch your lip.
Or what? You'll break my back too?

32:42.783 --> 32:45.381
OK, I asked her to marry me
and she said yeah.

32:45.383 --> 32:47.501
So that means it's my place,
so you can piss off.

32:47.503 --> 32:49.581
Touch her, I'll lay you out.
You and whose army?

32:49.583 --> 32:51.901
The day Eve's out of hospital
and says to go, then we'll go.

32:51.903 --> 32:54.421
I am not leaving Colin with you.
Then take him.

32:54.423 --> 32:56.461
It is his home before it's yours.
Now go!

32:56.463 --> 32:58.503
You want to fight someone? Fight me!

32:59.503 --> 33:00.701
Come on.

33:00.703 --> 33:01.741
You smart-arse.

33:01.743 --> 33:03.503
Do it.

33:05.463 --> 33:07.901
You'd love to see me tossed
in the clink, wouldn't you, James?

33:07.903 --> 33:09.343
If it helps them
see the back of you.

33:14.463 --> 33:16.143
You'll keep.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.602
Yes?

33:39.722 --> 33:42.320
Norman can take you all the way
if you'd prefer?

33:42.322 --> 33:45.200
Oh, just as long
as he gets me to the train.

33:45.202 --> 33:47.682
This is very sudden.

33:47.815 --> 33:49.173
Why not?

33:49.175 --> 33:50.653
Why?

33:50.655 --> 33:53.133
Andrew, as I said.

33:53.135 --> 33:54.933
Exactly. Why Andrew?

33:54.935 --> 33:57.853
You've shown no interest so far.
Why now?

33:57.855 --> 34:01.213
I'm not blind.
You and Sarah, I've seen.

34:01.215 --> 34:03.253
Seen what?

34:03.255 --> 34:07.933
The way that you... look at her
and the way that you talk about her.

34:07.935 --> 34:09.893
You and your romance novels.

34:09.895 --> 34:14.213
If you don't want to admit it, fine.
But it got me thinking about myself.

34:14.215 --> 34:17.533
And there are things
that I want to feel too.

34:17.534 --> 34:20.612
And I need someone
to feel them with.

34:20.614 --> 34:24.413
Andrew?
I didn't give him a chance before.

34:24.415 --> 34:27.612
Is this about giving him a chance?
Yes.

34:27.614 --> 34:31.373
I just want you to be happy.
If he does that...

34:31.375 --> 34:33.813
So you'd be happy
with anyone who made me happy?

34:33.815 --> 34:34.895
Yes.

34:37.735 --> 34:39.614
Within limits, of course.

34:42.495 --> 34:44.534
I'll be downstairs.
The car's waiting.

35:16.095 --> 35:17.935
Stop, could you,
please, Norman?

35:22.335 --> 35:23.655
Gino.

35:27.215 --> 35:30.653
Hey, where are you going?

35:30.655 --> 35:31.933
You have to trust me.

35:31.935 --> 35:35.453
Promise me that no matter
what you hear, that you trust me.

35:35.455 --> 35:38.375
Anna...
Promise me?

35:39.735 --> 35:40.935
Alright.

35:43.735 --> 35:45.775
Everything's going to be fine.

35:57.095 --> 35:58.575
OK, thank you, Norman.

36:19.255 --> 36:20.693
It doesn't worry you?

36:20.695 --> 36:21.935
What?

36:23.295 --> 36:24.613
Being as you are.

36:24.615 --> 36:27.613
Missing out on all the wonderful
things that marriage brings.

36:27.615 --> 36:30.375
"Wonderful." Like Eve and Bert?

36:31.815 --> 36:33.693
They don't represent all marriages.

36:33.695 --> 36:36.173
Just as Bert doesn't represent
all men.

36:36.175 --> 36:37.935
You're right.

36:42.655 --> 36:45.095
I felt my baby move
for the first time yesterday.

36:48.015 --> 36:50.533
It was an incredible experience.

36:50.535 --> 36:52.295
I bet.

36:57.055 --> 36:58.575
I'll do you a deal.

36:59.695 --> 37:02.653
I won't try to change you
if you don't try to change me.

37:02.655 --> 37:05.095
I'm not trying to change you.
Yes, you are.

37:06.175 --> 37:08.855
You must want to change.
No.

37:10.535 --> 37:12.173
Never occurred to you, has it,

37:12.175 --> 37:15.533
that someone could accept his lot
in being like this?

37:15.535 --> 37:16.855
No.

37:19.295 --> 37:23.935
Even if I hide it from the world,
I'm being honest with myself.

37:28.295 --> 37:31.655
If Bert gives you
any more trouble, let me know.

37:50.295 --> 37:52.493
Norman's back from taking Anna
to the station

37:52.495 --> 37:53.813
if you want the car to see Mother.

37:53.815 --> 37:55.775
Thank you. Family album.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.135
Anna had it out.

37:59.655 --> 38:01.135
Happy memories.

38:02.455 --> 38:04.533
Darling Elaine.

38:04.535 --> 38:06.055
Yes.

38:07.495 --> 38:09.895
I'm needed at the shed, so...
Norman's ready when you are.

38:22.975 --> 38:26.815
There you go, Mrs Jones.
The fresh air will do you good.

38:28.055 --> 38:29.733
Thank you so much.

38:29.735 --> 38:33.175
Here, I'll just pop this
over your knees.

38:41.695 --> 38:43.375
How's that?

38:50.588 --> 38:53.628
Leah Goldberg's sputum test results.
Ah.

38:56.588 --> 38:59.826
A very elegant woman just arrived
in the Bligh car.

38:59.828 --> 39:04.786
It's Regina Standish.
George's sister-in-law.

39:04.788 --> 39:06.506
Elizabeth summoned her.

39:06.508 --> 39:10.146
Really?
Yeah, I'm not sure why.

39:10.148 --> 39:12.306
Well, she is family.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.468
Maybe.

39:17.308 --> 39:19.266
Leah's not infectious anymore.

39:19.268 --> 39:21.348
Wonderful.
Yeah, it is.

39:22.988 --> 39:29.146
I have to admit, I'm shocked.
Why would Olivia hate you so much?

39:29.148 --> 39:32.586
Well, I am the nearest thing
she has to a mother-in-law.

39:32.588 --> 39:36.866
But she is
a changed girl, thanks to you.

39:36.868 --> 39:39.066
Oh, I'd like to take
all the credit but...

39:39.068 --> 39:42.306
No, what you've achieved in one day
is nothing short of miraculous.

39:42.308 --> 39:46.306
Olivia, Anna off
seeing Andrew Swanson.

39:46.308 --> 39:48.988
It augurs well for how
you'll manage with George.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.068
I'll take it slowly.

39:53.068 --> 39:55.826
We wouldn't want him
suspecting collusion.

39:55.828 --> 39:57.948
That's such an unpleasant word.

39:58.988 --> 40:00.588
Cooperation?

40:01.628 --> 40:03.108
Much better.

40:07.308 --> 40:08.826
Oh, excuse me.

40:08.828 --> 40:13.786
You must be Mrs Standish. I should
introduce myself. Sarah Adams.

40:13.788 --> 40:17.186
Ah, yes. I've heard about you.

40:17.188 --> 40:18.706
Oh.

40:18.708 --> 40:20.348
The Jew.
