Should I make joke about

In America, that's a very popular
joke. Do you have a mother-in-law joke?

11:02.960 --> 11:08.080

- A what time?

11:08.440 --> 11:11.560
Sexy time. I made sexy time
with my mother-in-law.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.040
You had sex with your mother-in-law?
- Yes.

11:15.440 --> 11:18.840
I don't think that americans will find
that funny. - No, it is not a joke.

11:20.240 --> 11:24.560
I'm talking about humor.

11:24.880 --> 11:28.960
Do you have a joke about your mother-in-low?

11:32.080 --> 11:35.320
Do you ever laugh on people
with retardation?

11:35.360 --> 11:42.200
Here in America, we try not to make fun of,
or be funny with things that people don't choose.

11:42.560 --> 11:47.680
But perhaps you have seen not someone
with very funny retardation.

11:48.200 --> 11:53.360
My brother, Bilok, have a verry
funny retardation.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.960
Mental retardation, you know, causes a lot
of pain hardship for a lot of families.

11:59.360 --> 12:04.440
Sometime, my sister, she show her vagin
to my brother and say

12:04.480 --> 12:06.680
You will never get this!
You will never get this!

12:08.240 --> 12:12.360
He, behind his cage, crazy -crazy,
everybody laughing. You never get this.

12:13.320 --> 12:18.720
But, one time, he break the cage, and he get
this. And then we all laugh. High 5!

12:26.080 --> 12:28.640
That would not be funny in America.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.440
What is a NOT jokes?

12:31.640 --> 12:34.920
A NOT joke is when we try to make
fun of something,

12:34.960 --> 12:37.440
and what we do is we make a statement,

12:38.040 --> 12:41.000
that we pretend it's true, but at
the end, we say NOT.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.120
Which means it's not true.
- So teach me how to make one.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.760
What color is your suit?
- This suit is grey.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.320
Grey, I would call it blue.
- It's grey.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.720
All right, it's blue grey,
but it certainly not black.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.160
Let's say it's grey
- It is grey.

12:58.040 --> 13:02.640
A NOT joke I would say:
that suit is black NOT!

13:04.040 --> 13:08.120
This suit is not black.
- No, no, no. Not needs to be at the end.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.000
This suit is black-not.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.880
This suit is black, pause, you know what
pause is? - Yes.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.640
This suit is black NOT!

13:17.920 --> 13:20.240
This suit is black pause NOT.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.680
You don't say pause.
This suit is black.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.600
That's a pause NOT.

13:28.400 --> 13:32.080
This suit is black.
- Ok.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.080
NOT.

13:41.200 --> 13:45.920
Everybody say USA television much better,
but this I watch for three hours and do not change.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.760
This two arrows to change the channel.

14:34.520 --> 14:37.480
Be careful, be careful, CJ.

14:37.680 --> 14:41.480
This CJ was like no
kazak woman I have ever seen.

14:42.280 --> 14:46.440
She had golden hairs,
teeth as white as pearls.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.000
And the ass hole of a 7 years old.

14:50.800 --> 14:54.280
For the first time in my lifes,
I was in love.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.480
Get Up! Get up!

15:01.480 --> 15:03.480
Why you aren't you ready?!

15:03.480 --> 15:05.480
We have people to interview today!

15:05.480 --> 15:07.080
I understand.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.960
Learn what you can from this women's group.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.560
My hair?
- It's beautiful. Don't worry.

15:15.400 --> 15:19.360
In Kazakstan, it is illegal for more
than 5 woman to be in the same place.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.080
Except for in brothel or in grave.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.520
In US of A, many womans meet in a groups,
called a feminists.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.680
I find them all.

15:30.440 --> 15:34.360
Feminist Veterans Of America.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.360
So what does means this feminism?

15:33.400 --> 15:39.080
It's the theory that women should be
equal to men in matters...

15:41.960 --> 15:45.280
You are laughing. Well, that is
the problem.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.720
Do you think a woman should be educate?
- Definitely.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.720
But is it not a problem that a woman have
a smaller brain that a man?

15:53.880 --> 15:54.840
That is wrong.

15:55.560 --> 15:59.160
But a government scientist doctor
lama prove that it is size of squirrel.

15:59.240 --> 16:02.720
Your government scientist?
He's wrong.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.560
Give me a smile, baby.
Why angry face?

16:06.320 --> 16:11.040
Well, what you say is very demeaning.
Do you know the world demeaning? -No.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.520
I could not concentrate on what
this old men were saying.

16:19.840 --> 16:24.080
All I could think about was this lovely
woman in her red water panties.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.480
Who was this CJ?

16:26.800 --> 16:30.160
Last night, I see, in my hotel room,

16:30.200 --> 16:35.840
a woman called CJ on the television.
Do you know her? -No.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.480
She from a town called the Baywatches.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.480
She's just on television.
Her name was Pamela.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.480
Do she live here in New York?
- She lives in California.

16:44.840 --> 16:47.000
O, you mean California.
- He's gonna look her up.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.120
Ok, can we finish now?

16:48.600 --> 16:50.480
Listen pussycat, try smile a bit.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.080
We're finished, we have to leave.

16:56.120 --> 17:00.560
Although I was obsessed by this CJ,
I could not pursue her.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.640
or else my wife will snap off my cock.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.680
Mister Sagdiyev?
- Yes.

17:09.680 --> 17:10.920
I have a telegram for you.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.599

17:16.720 --> 17:24.200

17:24.960 --> 17:30.720

17:30.920 --> 17:32.280
She is now dead.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.040
What you saying my wife is dead?

17:36.760 --> 17:39.120
This it what it's...

17:45.600 --> 17:48.040
Yes, sir. I'm sorry to inform you but that's
what the telegram says.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.200
Hi 5!

18:06.760 --> 18:08.760
What do you mean "California"?

18:09.240 --> 18:11.960
I have arranged all our filming for New York.

18:12.440 --> 18:15.480
But we need to leave New York
to find the real America -

18:15.480 --> 18:18.960
Rodeos, cowboys...
it will be better for our documentary.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.480
But why California?
What's there?

18:22.960 --> 18:25.960
Pearl Harbor is there...
and so is Texas.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.560
Eventually, I persuaded Azamat that
we will travel to California

18:30.520 --> 18:32.280
and make our reportings along
the way.

18:33.560 --> 18:38.520
He insist we do not fly, in case the jews
repeated their attack of 9/11.

18:39.480 --> 18:42.280
Okay, I'll find another way
for us to get there.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.440
I'm not used to that, but that's fine.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.600
Now, you do know how to drive a
little bit? - Yes.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.960
Put it in D.
- What?

18:58.360 --> 18:59.400
Drive.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.680
Wait a second, wait a second.
Have you driven a car before?

19:07.240 --> 19:08.920
Yes, many times.
- All right, let's go this way.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.160
Wait a minute, I don't want
you to hit anybody.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.840
Now use two hands now.
- What?

19:16.040 --> 19:19.320
But then it look like I'm holding a gipsy
while I eat my hram.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.440
I don't care what it looks like.
Use two hands when you drive, ok?

19:29.160 --> 19:31.400
Watch the children.
- Ok, no problem.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.520
Must not hit the children.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.800
Look, there is a woman in a car.
Can we follow her?

19:38.520 --> 19:40.280
And maybe make a sexy time with her.

19:42.200 --> 19:46.200
Why not? - Because a woman has a right
to choose who she has sex with.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.880
What!? They do?
- There must be consent.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.320
How about that. That's good, ha?

19:54.440 --> 19:55.560
It's not good for me.

19:59.080 --> 20:02.680
You want have a drink? - You can't drink
when you drive. It's against the law.

20:06.280 --> 20:09.720
Who is this car that follow us?

20:09.960 --> 20:11.480
Maybe we lose them
- We better not lose them.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.040
Hey, don't look at me. Eat my teets.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.040
We'll make a right turn right here.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.280
Don't look at me like that.
That will eat your shit.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.440
You fuck my mother.

20:23.560 --> 20:25.640
He.. do before.
Look on me.

20:26.120 --> 20:27.880
They're gonna throw us in jail.
Me with you.

20:28.440 --> 20:31.320
Why in jail.
He look on me! Behind.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.400
You can't say that.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.720
I like you? Do you like me?
- I do like you.

20:36.520 --> 20:39.160
You are my friend? - You're a nice
young man and I am your friend.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.880
Will you be my boyfriend?
- I won't be your boyfriend.

20:42.200 --> 20:46.520
Why not? You don't like me?
- Don't push, I can be.

20:48.440 --> 20:52.760
Great success. Now time to make purchase
of motorcars.

20:52.920 --> 20:57.000
I want to have a car that attract woman
with a shave down below.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.800
That would be a Corvette.
Or a Hummer.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.360
We will try to help you out here.

21:04.600 --> 21:07.880
A man, yesterday, tell me,
if I buy a car,

21:08.120 --> 21:11.800
I must buy one with a pussy magnet.
- He means a car that women would like.

21:12.360 --> 21:14.680
Yes, but where you keep this magnet?
- No, no there's no magnet.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.880
He means the vehicle.
Women love the Hummers.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.040
Do this have a pussy magnet?
- No.

21:22.600 --> 21:27.080
If I give you good price,
will you please put in pussy magnet?

21:27.880 --> 21:31.480
There's no such thing in this country
as a... magnet.

21:32.120 --> 21:37.000
If this car drive into a group a gipsy,
will there be any damage to the car?

21:37.640 --> 21:40.120
It depends on how hard you hit them
and all that? - Hard!

21:41.560 --> 21:44.520
If somebody rolls on the windshield,
it could crack your windshield.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.880
How fast do I need to go to guarantee
I kill them?

21:49.080 --> 21:52.520
With this vehicle right here, probably
doing 35-40 mph will do it.

21:54.120 --> 21:57.560
When I buy my wife,

21:57.560 --> 22:02.200
at the start, she was cook good,
her vagin work well,

22:02.600 --> 22:06.200
and she strong on plow. But after
three years, when she was 15,

22:07.480 --> 22:11.240
she become weak, her voice become a deep
Borat, Borat.

22:12.680 --> 22:15.960
She receive a heir on chest.

22:16.840 --> 22:19.480
And her vagin hang like
sleeve of wizard.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.640
How do I know that this will not
happen with the car?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.920
Chevrolet guarrantees that with
the warantee.

22:29.480 --> 22:33.720
I like very much buy this Hommers.
How much is it? - 52 thousand.

22:35.160 --> 22:41.080
I am looking for something between
600- 650 dollars.

22:41.160 --> 22:44.120
We don't have cars for 650 in
that you can buy.

22:44.520 --> 22:47.320
I might be able to sell you
a ho-sale car, a car with a lot of mileage

22:47.320 --> 22:49.080
for 700 but with no warranty.
- Ok.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.800
California, I coming.

23:14.040 --> 23:19.000
First on my journey was Washington DCs,
home of the mighty US warlords,

23:19.080 --> 23:20.360
premier Bush.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.600
Look who has an embassy here!

23:23.640 --> 23:25.320
Fuck you, mother fuckers!

23:27.160 --> 23:29.720
We arrive here to learn from
american politic.

official from ruling regime.

23:32.520 --> 23:36.080

at the start. - Thank you.

23:48.040 --> 23:51.560
My wife, she make this cheese.
- Very nice.

23:52.760 --> 23:55.000

After interview, I encounter
traditional american street festival.

24:08.760 --> 24:11.960

24:14.600 --> 24:18.040

than in New York.

24:24.600 --> 24:29.240
Next morning, I interview politician
who is a genuine chocolate face.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.840
No make-up.

24:30.680 --> 24:35.960
ALAN KEYES
2-time Republican Presidential Candidate.

24:31.400 --> 24:37.880
On a sunday, I arrive in Washingtons,
there was a parade, I make two friends,

24:38.360 --> 24:45.240
from this parade, I invite them back to my
hotel room, we drink like a normal in Kazakstan,

24:45.640 --> 24:47.000

24:47.720 --> 24:51.240
then they say I wash you in the shower,
he wash me in the shower.

24:51.880 --> 24:56.760
It sounds like you met somebody who is from,
what is called in America, the Gay community.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.480
What it mean... gay?
- Homosexual.

24:59.480 --> 25:01.080
Homosexual... you mean?

25:08.440 --> 25:13.400
You telling me that man who tried to put
rubber fist in my anus was homosexual?

25:19.640 --> 25:25.240
Even though my anus was broken, I knew that
rest of our journey would be great success.

25:26.200 --> 25:31.160
We left Washingtons and continue towards
California. Howdy, partners!

25:30.960 --> 25:34.960
Yes Minister, we're on schedule.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.960

TV appearance.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.960
Remember to talk of singing
National Anthem at rodeo.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.440
Don't worry, I am a TV professional.

25:57.080 --> 26:01.240

26:01.240 --> 26:05.160

27:27.640 --> 27:31.560
Metereologist Ted Johnson with the latest

Nice to meet you!
- Thank you.

28:33.760 --> 28:38.960
You are singing at a rodeo tonight!
Why didn't you mention it?

28:38.960 --> 28:41.520
What can I do? They are not professional.

28:41.960 --> 28:46.120
Get a move on, we have
100 miles to go.

29:14.520 --> 29:20.040
Of course, every picture that we get back
from the terrorists or anything else

29:20.920 --> 29:24.520
the muslims, they look like you,
like your black moustache

29:25.880 --> 29:28.520
Shave your damn moustache so you not
look so conspicuous

29:29.560 --> 29:35.320
so you look like maybe an italian, or
something, as far as people looking at you.

29:35.800 --> 29:40.840
I see a lot of people....
Young muslims working on bomb... strapped to it.

29:41.720 --> 29:44.440
And you probably are not a muslim.
Maybe that't not your religion.

29:44.440 --> 29:48.120
No, I'm kazak. I follow the hawk.
- But you look like one.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.840
This thing gets over with, and we win it,
and kick the butts over there,

29:53.080 --> 29:56.440
and all the damn sons of the buck hanging
from the gallow, by that time,

29:57.080 --> 29:59.880
you've proven yourself and they'll
understand you and be accepted.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.480
I don't kiss you.
- Why not?

30:03.880 --> 30:07.160
The people that do the kissing over here
are the one that float around like that.

30:07.320 --> 30:09.880
Ah, they...
- Yes, they'll wait for them to kiss.

30:12.040 --> 30:16.200
In my country, they take them and they take
them to jail and finish them.

30:16.600 --> 30:19.080
Take around and hang them?
That's what we're trying to get done here.

30:21.560 --> 30:25.240
Ladies and gentlemen, would you please
give a worm american welcome

30:25.720 --> 30:28.600
to a gentleman who has come all the
way from Kazakstan

30:29.400 --> 30:32.360
and we are honored to have singing our
national anthem

30:34.120 --> 30:35.640
Borat Sagdiyev.

30:45.480 --> 30:50.200
My name Borat. I come from Kazakstan.
Can I say first

30:50.840 --> 30:53.640
we support your war of terror.

30:57.880 --> 31:01.160
May we show our support to our
boys in Irak.

31:03.720 --> 31:07.880
May US and A kill every
single terrorist.

31:12.520 --> 31:18.840
May George Bush drink the blood of every
single man, woman and child of Irak.

31:21.960 --> 31:25.720
May you destroy that country so that for
the next thousand years

31:26.200 --> 31:29.560
not even a single lizard will survive
in their desert.

31:31.320 --> 31:35.080
To show our friendship,
I now will sing

31:35.160 --> 31:39.400
our kazak national anthem to the tune
of your national anthem.

31:40.680 --> 31:41.800
Listen.

31:43.480 --> 31:49.640
Kazakstan is the greatest
country in the world,

31:50.200 --> 31:55.960
All other countries are run
by little girls,

31:56.600 --> 32:02.600
Kazakstan is number one
exporter of potasium,

32:02.920 --> 32:09.000
Other central asian countries
have in theory our potasium

32:10.040 --> 32:15.000
Kazakstan is the greatest country
in the world,

32:15.560 --> 32:20.360
All other countries is the home
of the gays.

32:31.960 --> 32:34.960
We nearly died last night.
This journey is cursed.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.640
We should have stayed in New York.

32:38.040 --> 32:41.080
I was sad. The rodeo peoples
did not like me.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.720
What if Pamela did not like me too?

32:44.520 --> 32:47.080
We needed something to change
our fortunes.

32:47.960 --> 32:49.960
Look Azamat, a Gypsy village.

32:50.480 --> 32:54.080
Let us extract some of their tears
so we can remove the curse.

32:54.680 --> 32:57.080
Do not fear me, gipsy.
All I want from you is your tears.

32:58.120 --> 33:00.040
Let's give them to me or
I would take them.

33:01.960 --> 33:05.400
I'm not a gipsy. I'm midwestern
farmer's daughter, americana.

33:06.120 --> 33:07.960
You have many treasures.
Who did your rob for this?

33:08.360 --> 33:10.760
We didn't rob them.
They all came from inside the house.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.680
I will look in your treasures, gipsy.

33:14.840 --> 33:18.120
Is this understood?
I will look on them. - Please, do.

33:22.280 --> 33:27.080
Who is this lady you shrunk? Was she the owner
of this house that you came in front of?

33:27.800 --> 33:29.160
There's couple more child's doll.

33:30.040 --> 33:32.680
Do not try and shrink me, gipsy.
I, serious.

33:33.480 --> 33:34.360
These are your spells?

33:35.400 --> 33:38.040
No, look on this.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
Oh, Baywatch.
- Baywatch.

33:55.960 --> 33:58.440
Azamat, great success!
I have the tears.

33:58.560 --> 34:00.280
Onwards to California!

34:00.280 --> 34:01.960
Lets go!

34:01.960 --> 34:05.480
What's that you've got there?

34:02.960 --> 34:05.480
- It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

34:17.960 --> 34:20.159
Are we going the right way?

34:20.159 --> 34:22.159
I do not know, this map is from 1917.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.480
- Where the hell are we?

34:37.960 --> 34:40.960
I am going to stop to ask.

34:40.960 --> 34:43.159
- No, no, no, keep going. Keep going.

34:46.679 --> 34:49.719
I need a direction to California, please.
- You're far away from home.

34:52.440 --> 34:56.679
I travel with my friend Azamat Bagatov,
we travel across the country

35:00.360 --> 35:03.880
You look like Michael Jackson,
Beat It.

35:08.600 --> 35:12.760
I like you, peoples. Can you teach me how
to dress? How can I be like you?

35:13.320 --> 35:14.680
First is to loosen up your belt

35:17.080 --> 35:18.440
Don't pull down like you try to go...

35:20.760 --> 35:24.040
Like this?
- But don't show your Huggies down there.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.560
What kind of music do you listen to?

35:31.560 --> 35:34.840
I like very much...
Do you know...?

35:38.680 --> 35:41.720
You gotta lick it,
before you kick it.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.480
Can you teach me speak like you?
- What you're trying to say?

35:46.120 --> 35:49.160
How do you say How do you do?
- What's up with it.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.480
Pull over and let's see
if we can stay here.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.520
What's up with it, vanilla face?

36:04.920 --> 36:08.200
Me and my homie Azamat just
park our slab outside,

36:09.240 --> 36:12.440
We're looking for somewhere to post up

36:13.000 --> 36:15.160
So, bang-bang, skid, skid,

36:16.680 --> 36:17.640
We're just a couple of people

36:20.120 --> 36:23.000
Leave now or we'll call the cops
and have you taken out.

36:23.240 --> 36:28.160
We can't stay here,
they are 'player haters'.

36:36.440 --> 36:39.320
You have a room for tonight?
- Yes, definitely.

36:41.480 --> 36:44.120

36:46.600 --> 36:51.000
Beautiful house. This..

36:52.280 --> 36:56.360
What is this man?
- This is a yemenite jew, and he's working

36:56.600 --> 37:02.600

also jewellers.

37:03.320 --> 37:08.280
Why do you have a picture of a jew?
- Because I'm jewish, so.

37:15.960 --> 37:19.240
This is the room, and...

37:20.920 --> 37:23.880
do you need two pillows?
- Yes.

37:25.080 --> 37:26.440
Great. Thank you.
Lovely place.

37:29.160 --> 37:32.280
They're Jews.
- I know that now.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.240
Look if we can stay here.

37:31.880 --> 37:33.640
We cannot stay here,
they are motherfuckers.

37:32.360 --> 37:34.440
They'll kill us.
We need to escape.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.680
Wait, wait.
- Ok.

37:52.280 --> 37:55.960
Hello.

37:57.960 --> 38:02.520
This is a special sandwich for you.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.800
He can eat this.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.120
Take a half.

38:13.880 --> 38:16.040
Not so hungry.
- Eat a little bit.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.720
Go ahead, eat something, because you're
hungry and you're a guest.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.000
I don't want to see you go hungry.

38:35.720 --> 38:37.960
What is this picture over here?

38:47.000 --> 38:51.160
It is three in the morning, I am in
the nest with jews.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.880
They have cleverly shifted their shapes.

38:54.520 --> 38:58.280
One of them has taken the form of a
little old woman.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.080
You can barely see her haunts.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.600
She have try to poison me already.

39:05.960 --> 39:07.320
This rats are very clever.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.280
Look, the Jews have
shifted their shapes.

39:17.960 --> 39:20.240
OK, OK. How much shall
I give them?

39:20.280 --> 39:22.960
I don't know.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.480
More.
Give them more.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.360
Go, go.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.960
Let's go back to New York,
at least there's no Jews there.

39:46.960 --> 39:49.160
Calm down.
We'll keep heading to California.

39:49.160 --> 39:50.960
Why California?
What's so special about California?

39:50.960 --> 39:51.960
We are going to California!

39:51.960 --> 39:53.480
And get killed on the way?

39:53.480 --> 39:58.080
Relax Azamat!
I will get us protection.

40:00.680 --> 40:03.720
What is the best gun to defend
from a jew?

40:06.680 --> 40:10.520
I would recommend either a 9 mm
or a 45.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.360
Very nice!

40:16.920 --> 40:20.440
I, movie star, Dirty Harold.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.400
Come on and make my name, jew.

40:25.720 --> 40:28.280
But he would not sell me guns,
since I'm not american.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.240
So I look for other protection.

40:34.920 --> 40:37.640
What type of dog is this?
- This is a tortoise.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.840
Is this a cat in a hat?

40:41.160 --> 40:43.080
No, it's a tortoise in a shell.

40:45.240 --> 40:49.160
I need the animal for protection.
What you have for me?

41:13.480 --> 41:16.440
We're safe
Now we continue to California.

41:34.440 --> 41:37.480
Switch it off.
It's so annoying.

41:53.080 --> 41:56.440
Happy times. We were safe and well
on our way to Pamela.

41:57.160 --> 41:59.160
It was time to get back to work.

41:59.960 --> 42:05.960
Kazakhstan needs to learn about
American fine dining.

42:06.960 --> 42:08.440

Southern manners.

42:08.440 --> 42:10.440
How long have I got?

42:10.440 --> 42:13.960

44:07.920 --> 44:12.000

44:52.560 --> 44:54.400

That's a very good observation.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.360
She is your wife?
- No, that's my wife.

45:03.920 --> 45:08.640
In my country, they would go crazy.

45:08.720 --> 45:10.480
For this two,
not so much...

45:16.640 --> 45:20.080
What should I say if I need to
go to the shit-hole?

45:21.600 --> 45:22.480
You mean to the restroom?

45:23.200 --> 45:25.360

46:06.400 --> 46:09.440
And I think he is a delightful man...
and it wouldn't take

46:10.400 --> 46:14.400
a very large time for him to really
become americanized.

46:14.960 --> 46:18.240
Thank you very much, I feel much better.
Cindy, where should I put this?

46:29.600 --> 46:31.680

- No, no, no.

46:48.400 --> 46:50.240
Nobody touches you except you.

46:51.120 --> 46:53.120
Can I bring a guest to dinner?

46:54.000 --> 46:57.600

46:58.720 --> 47:03.040

47:44.800 --> 47:46.880
Absolutly not and neither can you!

47:46.880 --> 47:50.240
The sheriff is on his way.
- I hope so.

47:50.480 --> 47:53.280

47:56.560 --> 48:00.400

48:01.920 --> 48:04.560

48:09.600 --> 48:11.600

48:47.120 --> 48:51.200
You were funny on this wolf.
Everybody almost see your underpants.

48:52.560 --> 48:54.080
I never rode a bull before.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.320
You wanna come in for a little while?

49:02.320 --> 49:05.360

49:08.480 --> 49:10.560

49:11.200 --> 49:15.040

49:16.400 --> 49:17.680
If I ever in town again, Luenell,

49:18.800 --> 49:20.560

49:24.160 --> 49:27.120
Good night, Luenells.
- Good night, Borat.

49:34.880 --> 49:37.280

50:04.400 --> 50:06.480

50:07.280 --> 50:08.960
I'm very spontaneous too.

50:28.800 --> 50:33.680
I needed a gift to give to Pamela so that
she would grant me entry into her vagin.

50:34.960 --> 50:39.760
Therefore, I convince Azamat to let me
film a report in a american store.

50:41.200 --> 50:44.640
Don't spend more than 3 dollars.
We're low on money.

50:46.800 --> 50:49.920
This your shops?
- Right, this is my antique shop.

50:50.640 --> 50:55.040
Why do you have so many things with a flag?
- We're honouring our heritage.

50:56.080 --> 50:59.040
And in here.
What is this?

50:59.600 --> 51:02.080
These are a number of collectibles,
I mean, this is...

51:02.640 --> 51:06.720
A lamp. You know, to use in your home.
This is a chinese closet...

51:08.800 --> 51:12.240

51:44.080 --> 51:46.640
I don't think you gonna be able to glue
that stuff back, I think you gonna have

51:46.640 --> 51:47.680
to pay for it.

51:47.680 --> 51:50.320
Ok, I have digital watch from the future.

51:50.400 --> 51:52.560
I will give you this.
We are small than all of this.

51:53.280 --> 51:56.160
You broke 425 $ worth of stuff.

51:56.640 --> 51:58.240
160,...170...

51:59.920 --> 52:02.160

52:02.880 --> 52:05.520
Do you want a hair?
- No, I don't want any damn hair.

52:05.520 --> 52:08.960

This hair from pubis. I can get you

52:12.720 --> 52:14.720
We don't use that stuff in this country.

52:14.920 --> 52:18.800
Have you offered them pubic hair?

52:17.400 --> 52:18.800
- Yes!

52:19.280 --> 52:20.720
Just gimme another 20, that's good

52:20.640 --> 52:22.640
It was a mistake.

52:21.600 --> 52:22.640
- You screwed up again!

52:23.200 --> 52:24.240
I didn't see the truck.

52:24.240 --> 52:25.200
I slipped on it and that was it.

52:25.840 --> 52:28.240
- Only an idiot could do this.

52:26.560 --> 52:28.560
Would you have believe this
if I have told you?

52:29.040 --> 52:30.000
All right, go, go!

52:35.480 --> 52:38.120

and almost bankrupt us!

52:38.640 --> 52:40.120
- So call the Ministry
and get more money.

52:40.640 --> 52:44.120
What?!  If I did that they
would kill us!

52:44.120 --> 52:48.640
California better be as good as you
say, or we're finished.

53:08.640 --> 53:10.640
You bastard!

53:11.120 --> 53:12.120
What's the matter with you?!

53:12.640 --> 53:15.120
How dare you make
hand-party over Pamela!

53:15.120 --> 53:18.120
Why do you care who I
pleasure myself to?

53:18.120 --> 53:20.120
Because I love this woman!

53:20.120 --> 53:23.120
She's the reason
we travel to California!

53:23.120 --> 53:24.640
What?

53:23.600 --> 53:24.640

56:06.880 --> 56:09.200
Azamat leave.

56:21.040 --> 56:25.760
And he also decide to take all money
and also my passport.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.760
And, he leave me all this bag.

56:37.840 --> 56:39.120
It's a hen.

56:44.160 --> 56:48.800
And ticket to Kazakstan,
but no passport.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
But at least he's...

56:55.360 --> 56:57.680
man enough to leave me...

57:04.240 --> 57:05.280
my beautiful.

57:16.400 --> 57:21.120
And I decide to continue
making documentary.

57:22.160 --> 57:26.720
Making without Azamat I think it will
be better.

57:26.720 --> 57:30.160

58:31.120 --> 58:34.320
I have no car, no money and
no Azamat.

58:34.800 --> 58:39.840
The only thing keep me going was my dream
of one day holding Pamela in my arms

58:40.560 --> 58:43.760

We'll always be behind you.
- Do not let a woman ever...

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:42.040

- Goodbye, my friend.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.360

and we gonna always be a christian nation

until good Lord returns. Amin.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.280
I didn't evolve out of a monkey.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.120
I didn't use to be a...,
I is what I is.

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.560
I don't care what the devil is done to you
or what he's trying to do,

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.960

You have to calm down.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.279
Ok, ok. Take it easy.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:17.880
Well thats another fine mess
you've gotten me into.

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:24.760
I have not come to Hollywood
to fight a man dressed as Hitler.

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:29.560
I have come to make Pamela
Anderson my wife.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.880
So I forgave Azamat.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.600
I knew that you'd make it, Borat.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:39.080
I felt so bad that I prepared this.

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:45.080
It's everything I could find about Pamela.

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:51.359
Last friday she appeared for a group
who are against cruelty toward animals.

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:54.360
<i>Against</i> cruelty toward animals?

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.360
And tomorrow she's doing autographs.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.880
She wrote a book.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.360
What? A woman has written a book?

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:15.560
Dr. Yamak would never believe this.

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:15.880

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.640

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.480

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.880
NOT!

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.840
I was humiliated.

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:45.280
It was time for me to return
to New York,

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:48.600
where a ticket was waiting for me
to fly back home.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:54.160
While I sat on the bus, I thought of my
journey over the past three weeks.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.520
The great times.

01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.640
The good times.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.600
And the shit times.

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.760
Mainly there were shit times.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.800
I have come to America to learn
lessons for Kazakstan.

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.520
But what had I learn?

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.080
Suddenly, I realized.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.000
I have learned that if you chase a dream,

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.200
especially one with plastic chests,

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:28.560
you can miss the real beauty
in front of your eyes.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
8 Months Later.

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.240
