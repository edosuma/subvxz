41:15.949 --> 41:17.148
Okay, we're listening.

41:17.272 --> 41:18.792
So, the marker in mine and Cal's blood

41:18.817 --> 41:20.625
could be a sign of ischemia.

41:20.804 --> 41:22.938
It occurs when
the circulation is limited,

41:22.963 --> 41:26.197
but the potency of this marker
is on par with a stroke victim.

41:26.363 --> 41:28.029
So you think we all had strokes?

41:28.198 --> 41:29.498
No, not exactly.

41:29.658 --> 41:32.071
If we were taken close to death...

41:32.096 --> 41:34.063
extremely close
and then brought back...

41:34.110 --> 41:36.977
if the faucet of blood
circulation has been turned off

41:37.040 --> 41:38.807
and then suddenly it
was turned on high,

41:38.894 --> 41:40.375
that's what it would look like.

41:40.561 --> 41:42.807
Interesting theory.
How do we know for sure?

41:42.941 --> 41:46.281
Right, so my thinking was if
I had some brain tissue,

41:46.336 --> 41:47.992
I could test for that rebound.

41:48.129 --> 41:50.095
If they take a sample
during an autopsy,

41:50.120 --> 41:51.403
maybe I could have some access.
