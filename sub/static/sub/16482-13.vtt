Previously on <i>This Is Us...</i>

00:01.804 --> 00:03.976
I've decided to have
gastric bypass surgery.

00:04.227 --> 00:06.046
- Uh, I'm gonna do it.
- Do what?

00:06.070 --> 00:08.326
The surgery. I just don't
want you to freak out, okay?

00:08.351 --> 00:09.839
Don't worry about me freaking out.

00:09.874 --> 00:11.708
Uh, well, I do have to
worry about it, Kate,

00:11.743 --> 00:14.063
because the thing is, is that
I'm kind of in love with you.

00:15.311 --> 00:17.584
I'd marry the hell out
of you, Kate Pearson.

00:17.631 --> 00:19.659
Yeah, I'm gonna continue to date Sloane

00:19.683 --> 00:22.049
because she's kind, and
she's sweet, she's funny.

00:22.084 --> 00:23.329
And-And, you know what?
Sometimes you just got to

00:23.353 --> 00:25.764
do the right thing, even
if it's not what you want.

00:25.788 --> 00:27.988
This cancer is coming
for me sooner than later.

00:28.023 --> 00:29.358
I can feel it.

00:29.383 --> 00:31.633
The medication isn't working anymore.

00:31.945 --> 00:33.539
Do you want to stop the chemo, Will?

our beautiful children
need a beautiful dog.

01:52.297 --> 01:53.119
Okay.

01:53.144 --> 01:54.719
- Get them a dog.
- Okay.

01:54.744 --> 01:56.878
And then get them a new
mommy who will walk it.

01:56.902 --> 01:58.533
That's fair enough, but, um...

01:58.558 --> 02:02.111
do you, uh, do you want
to interview these women,

02:14.881 --> 02:16.080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:16.115 --> 02:17.707
What happened to knocking, huh?

02:17.732 --> 02:19.494
And since when do you call meetings?

02:19.518 --> 02:20.754
Yeah, last I checked, we...

02:20.779 --> 02:22.194
- we call the meetings.
- Yeah.

02:22.219 --> 02:24.073
You attend the meetings, and
then we continue to feed you.

02:24.097 --> 02:26.148
That's-That's the deal.
What's up?

02:26.195 --> 02:28.538
We want our own birthday
parties this year.

02:28.890 --> 02:29.968
- What?
- What?

02:30.366 --> 02:32.741
But you guys love
sharing a birthday party.

02:32.766 --> 02:34.695
You get the... the three layer cake,

02:34.720 --> 02:36.445
and the birthday banner,

02:36.470 --> 02:38.117
- and pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey.
- The... donkey.

02:38.141 --> 02:40.812
Mom, we're gonna be ten, we're
too old for donkeys and banners.

02:40.837 --> 02:42.616
I want a Madonna party.

02:42.641 --> 02:44.171
Sophie and I love Madonna.

02:44.218 --> 02:46.148
- You do?
- Hold on a second, who's Sophie?

02:46.173 --> 02:48.116
- My best friend.
- What happened to Grace?

02:48.141 --> 02:51.445
- We drifted.
- I want a <i>Princess Bride</i> party.

02:51.523 --> 02:53.812
- <i>Princess Bride?</i> (chuckles)
- You want what?

02:53.837 --> 02:56.218
Kevin, seriously, you were
terrified by that movie.

02:56.243 --> 02:57.296
That's when I was nine.

02:57.321 --> 02:59.116
Now that I'm gonna be ten, I love it.

03:00.383 --> 03:01.984
Okay.
Hey, Randall!

03:02.445 --> 03:04.671
- Come in here, son.
- RANDALL: What's going on?

03:04.976 --> 03:06.304
Are we all getting
checked for lice again?

03:06.328 --> 03:07.468
REBECCA: No. (sighs)

03:07.976 --> 03:10.695
Baby, do you want your
own birthday party, too?

03:11.804 --> 03:13.421
- Meh
- REBECCA: Kevin!

03:13.446 --> 03:14.976
- Hey.
- Stop.

03:15.460 --> 03:18.487
Uh, maybe we could invite
some of your friends from school.

03:18.512 --> 03:21.746
That's okay. They have a
rule that if you have a party,

03:21.781 --> 03:24.364
you have to invite the whole class.
It's too many kids.

03:24.389 --> 03:25.808
- The whole class?
- So we do the whole class.

03:25.832 --> 03:26.732
The whole class!

03:26.757 --> 03:27.840
Can I have a magician?

03:28.043 --> 03:30.825
Uh... yeah.

03:30.856 --> 03:32.497
- Right?
- Okay, I'm in.

03:32.758 --> 03:33.653
Okay, so...

03:33.678 --> 03:35.723
Meeting's over. Thank you, everybody.

03:35.778 --> 03:36.879
Thanks for stopping by!

03:36.904 --> 03:38.340
I know, "shut the door".

03:39.067 --> 03:40.067
(door closes)

03:40.169 --> 03:41.402
What just happened?

03:41.438 --> 03:42.754
Uh...

03:42.832 --> 03:46.372
So, let's talk dates
for your gastric bypass.

03:47.067 --> 03:48.274
Yeah.

03:49.442 --> 03:52.231
Does the first week of
February work for you?

03:53.512 --> 03:54.512
Yeah, or...

03:55.145 --> 03:56.145
never at all.

03:56.684 --> 03:58.700
Either one of those sound good to me.

04:00.332 --> 04:01.332
Kate...

04:02.189 --> 04:03.372
what's going on?

04:05.192 --> 04:07.325
- I got engaged.
- Congrats.

04:07.350 --> 04:08.350
Thank you.

04:08.926 --> 04:11.012
But my fiancé...

04:12.032 --> 04:14.715
sorry, that's just crazy to say.

04:14.902 --> 04:15.707
Fiancé.

04:15.895 --> 04:18.129
I have a fiancé. I feel so French.

04:18.325 --> 04:21.200
- Your fiancé...
- Uh...

04:21.464 --> 04:22.887
he just had heart surgery.

04:24.309 --> 04:25.887
And it was terrifying.

04:26.184 --> 04:30.317
And the thought of either one
of us having surgery, it...

04:31.145 --> 04:33.864
Wait, am I insane for
wanting to bail? I don't know.

04:34.036 --> 04:37.911
Oh. I-I just don't think it's
the right time for surgery.

04:38.090 --> 04:39.231
At least not now.

04:39.581 --> 04:41.581
But... (sighs) Damn.

04:42.429 --> 04:44.730
I was excited to lose
some serious weight,

04:45.092 --> 04:46.458
and quick.

04:47.223 --> 04:48.239
Kate...

04:49.189 --> 04:52.076
have you ever considered an
immersive weight loss experience?

04:52.101 --> 04:52.951
A fat camp?

04:52.976 --> 04:55.760
There is a incredible facility upstate,

04:55.761 --> 04:56.811
in the Adirondacks.

04:56.836 --> 04:58.389
It's a month-long program.

04:58.414 --> 04:59.303
No distractions,

04:59.328 --> 05:00.693
no temptations.

05:00.928 --> 05:03.756
Total focus and a lot of hard work.

05:05.801 --> 05:08.607
I'm late. I'm late. Juice?

05:08.787 --> 05:10.111
- Oh.
- Yeah.

05:10.136 --> 05:11.225
- Bam.
- Thanks.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.811
And how about some yogurt real quick?

05:13.836 --> 05:15.398
Can't, Tyler wants
to see me first thing.

05:15.422 --> 05:16.772
- About what?
- Mm-mm.

05:16.797 --> 05:18.498
What's cookin', good lookins?

05:18.523 --> 05:20.423
- (laughs)
- Oh, you know.

05:20.547 --> 05:22.279
- Wednesday.
- Ah, Wednesday,

05:22.304 --> 05:24.336
the meat in the
Tuesday-Thursday sandwich,

05:24.397 --> 05:26.997
and what a sweet, sweet
meat sandwich it is.

05:27.915 --> 05:28.772
You okay, William?

05:28.797 --> 05:29.920
Okay? Am I okay?

05:30.004 --> 05:32.022
Mm, yeah, that's the
question on the table.

05:32.047 --> 05:34.600
"Okay" does not do
justice to how I feel.

05:34.652 --> 05:36.352
I feel better than
I've felt in months.

05:36.377 --> 05:36.919
Mm.

- I feel like sex, I feel like magic,

Tess lent me her iPad.

05:43.925 --> 05:45.692
IPod. That's an iPod.

05:45.717 --> 05:47.349
You say "pod," I say "pad."

05:47.374 --> 05:49.731
Let's call the whole thing off. (laughs)

05:49.756 --> 05:51.357
Can you show me how to
put my music in this?

05:51.381 --> 05:53.841
- I've really got to run.
- Thanks, son. I'll go get my list.

things are good with us.

least another two weeks

so I will just get to know
the Big Apple a little bit.

07:34.572 --> 07:36.188
Do you know anyone in the city?

07:36.462 --> 07:37.930
Not a soul.

07:38.128 --> 07:39.394
But I will be fine.

07:39.421 --> 07:41.883

07:42.058 --> 07:43.357

- Yeah.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.649
- I bet it's gonna be so hardcore.
- Uh-huh.

07:50.674 --> 07:52.273
- I'm gonna puke so much.
- Oof.

07:52.442 --> 07:54.766
But I'm not gonna be one of
those people who complains.

07:54.980 --> 07:56.461
- Uh-uh.
- I'm just gonna... puke.

07:56.549 --> 07:58.087
Yeah, that's the-that's
the right attitude.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.739

07:59.763 --> 08:00.301
Uh-huh.

08:00.326 --> 08:02.891

I cry a pool full of tears.

08:02.916 --> 08:03.618
(laughs)

08:03.643 --> 08:05.572

hundred laps in that pool.

08:05.596 --> 08:06.821

Oh, you're welcome, fiancée.

08:19.856 --> 08:21.735
- Let's stop doing that.
- Okay, yeah, it was enough.

08:21.759 --> 08:23.160
- Yeah, that was disgusting.
- Yeah.

You wanted to see me?

08:27.924 --> 08:29.180
Yeah, yeah, come in, come in.

08:29.787 --> 08:31.852
Randall, do you know Sanjay Jahiri?

08:33.254 --> 08:34.532
Only by reputation.

Randall Pearson.

08:37.977 --> 08:39.578
Apologies if I'm a little sweaty.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.172
That's all good in the hood.

08:41.811 --> 08:43.366
TYLER: So, did Sarah tell you

08:43.392 --> 08:45.039
about our potential
new wind farm client?

08:45.135 --> 08:46.696
In pre-construction, in Alberta, yeah.

08:46.768 --> 08:47.768
Calgary.

08:47.851 --> 08:49.805
Which is a city in the
province of Alberta.

08:50.015 --> 08:51.828
Sorry. Was just specifying.

08:51.853 --> 08:54.053
Appreciate that, Sanjay,
I know the specifics.

08:54.664 --> 08:56.844
TYLER: Sanjay's gonna come
aboard help us land them.

08:57.212 --> 08:58.391
Really?

08:59.156 --> 09:01.992
I-I was hoping to throw my hat
in the ring for that account.

09:02.017 --> 09:05.016
Oh, well, given Sanjay's background
in, uh, renewable energy...

09:05.041 --> 09:07.039
I've got interest in renewable, too.

09:09.987 --> 09:12.220
Uh, I at least deserve a shot at this.

09:12.342 --> 09:13.342
Sir.

09:15.273 --> 09:16.328
Fair enough.

09:16.454 --> 09:18.048
Why don't you both work on a derivative.

09:18.072 --> 09:19.197
Get it to me by the end of the week.

09:19.221 --> 09:20.933
End of the week? I can
probably have something to you

09:20.957 --> 09:22.123
by tomorrow morning.

09:23.055 --> 09:24.336
Sanjay, sound good?

09:25.900 --> 09:26.914
No problem here.

09:26.939 --> 09:28.532
TYLER: May the best derivative win.

a little less reminiscing...

doesn't know anyone here,

you could hang out with him.

14:13.653 --> 14:14.911

kids from your school?

15:43.473 --> 15:45.273
- Yeah.
- Oh, they're probably not gonna come.

15:45.631 --> 15:48.175
Why? Did you forget to
hand out the invitations?

15:48.200 --> 15:49.800
No. I handed them out.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.640
It's just that they're not my friends.

15:51.896 --> 15:53.488
Come on, man, that's not true.

15:53.513 --> 15:55.894

- No.
- We're not upset at all.

- Not just little kid funny.

Is it because he's black?

Come on.

16:28.013 --> 16:28.847
Those racist bastards.

16:28.872 --> 16:30.394
Right? Jack, don't...

16:30.434 --> 16:32.266
- don't get emotional.
- I'm not emotional.

16:32.309 --> 16:33.387
I'm not emotional, you're emotional.

16:33.411 --> 16:34.941
- I'm not emotional.
- Okay.

16:35.247 --> 16:37.605
Well, we got to get it together.

16:41.293 --> 16:42.299
Why don't we

16:42.324 --> 16:44.582
poach kids from one of
the other two parties

16:44.621 --> 16:45.786
and send them out to Randall's?

16:45.810 --> 16:47.503
Okay, great, we take three from there,

16:47.528 --> 16:48.535
that'll double his party.

16:48.560 --> 16:49.691
- Perfect.
- Yeah?

16:49.716 --> 16:51.503
Okay, let's go steal some kids.

16:53.652 --> 16:56.894
Oh man, I never spent a whole day
with a famous person before.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.044
I went to a dinner party once
with the guy who came in eighth

16:59.068 --> 17:00.621
on Carrie Underwood's season of <i> Idol,</i>

17:00.646 --> 17:02.425
but obviously, you're
way better than that.

17:02.450 --> 17:04.152
Well, thank you, Toby.
I appreciate that.

17:04.176 --> 17:05.964
Malia, how are you? Good to see you.

17:06.097 --> 17:08.089
Oh, he knows the rope girl
by name. Of course he does.

17:08.113 --> 17:09.121
Hello, Malia.

17:09.355 --> 17:11.167
Please give my regards to Sasha.

17:12.464 --> 17:13.488
It's an Obama joke.

17:14.064 --> 17:14.675
(whistles) Toby?

17:14.700 --> 17:15.700
- Yeah?
- Come on.

17:15.824 --> 17:17.761
- All right.
- Here we go.

17:18.702 --> 17:20.894
(chuckles) This place is incredible.

17:21.691 --> 17:22.855
You see those two women?

17:22.880 --> 17:24.244
They look like <i>Westworld</i> hosts.

17:24.808 --> 17:25.769
KEVIN: Not interested.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.233
Whatever conversation
I'd have with those girls,

17:27.257 --> 17:28.380
I guarantee you, Toby,

17:28.405 --> 17:29.805
I've had it a billion times before.

17:29.910 --> 17:30.933
It goes like this:

17:31.011 --> 17:32.597
"You watch <i> The Manny?</i> Really?"

17:32.622 --> 17:34.122
"Yes, the baby is cute in real life."

17:34.147 --> 17:35.699
"You want to get into acting, too?"

17:35.724 --> 17:36.977
"Well, that's phenomenal."

17:37.449 --> 17:38.730
Margarita, Tequila Soda,

17:38.755 --> 17:39.925
Tequila Rocks, tequila shot,

17:39.950 --> 17:41.191
hotel, sex, room service,

17:41.216 --> 17:43.027
shower, sex, Uber. It's...

17:45.424 --> 17:47.344
It's hard to believe we're
even the same species.

17:49.354 --> 17:50.205
Olivia, right,

17:50.241 --> 17:51.511
w-was exciting,

17:51.536 --> 17:54.191
you know, a-and... and dark and sexy

17:54.216 --> 17:55.629
and the whole thing
was just... it was...

17:55.653 --> 17:57.652
(chuckles) it was intoxicating.

17:57.905 --> 17:59.386
And t-then Sloane, Sloane was...

17:59.411 --> 18:00.567
she was great in her own way.

18:00.591 --> 18:02.074
She was just adorable, you know?

18:02.099 --> 18:04.168
A-And intelligent and interesting,

18:04.272 --> 18:06.639
and so I... I chose Sloane.

18:07.097 --> 18:08.097
But now...

18:08.767 --> 18:10.520
now I'm wondering if I
should have chosen Olivia.

18:10.544 --> 18:11.544
And I...

18:13.543 --> 18:15.020
All right, well, we
don't have to stand around

18:15.044 --> 18:16.863
and get drunk and
flirt with supermodels.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.128
We could just...

18:19.500 --> 18:21.105
talk, if you like. (sighs)

18:23.472 --> 18:24.912
(in deep voice) About your feelings.

18:25.633 --> 18:26.967
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:27.838 --> 18:29.277
How do you not like magic?

18:29.360 --> 18:30.960
FEZZIK (on video) Anybody want a peanut?

18:31.108 --> 18:32.371
Uh, hey. Excuse me.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.712
Hey, bud, do you like magic?

18:35.184 --> 18:36.622
'Cause I hear there's
an awesome magician

18:36.646 --> 18:37.699
outside in the backyard.

18:37.724 --> 18:39.433
- I'm good.
- You're good?

18:39.888 --> 18:41.154
- You sure?
- Hey, babe.

18:41.369 --> 18:42.440
- Come on over here a second.
- Wow.

18:42.464 --> 18:44.366
- What?
- You know what doesn't say "I'm good"?

18:45.091 --> 18:46.574
- What?
- A baby.

18:47.076 --> 18:48.628
- Jack.
- Mm-hmm.

18:49.034 --> 18:52.168
(gasps) There's the birthday boy!

18:52.193 --> 18:54.402
How's everything going
outside? Are you having fun?

18:54.427 --> 18:57.121
Yep. Just going to the bathroom.

18:57.546 --> 18:58.746
Bud, I'm sorry

18:58.771 --> 18:59.895
more people didn't come
to your birthday party.

18:59.919 --> 19:01.176
I bet they wanted to
come, but they probably

19:01.200 --> 19:03.675
had other things going on
that they couldn't get out of.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.152
No, they didn't. They're
just not my friends.

19:06.390 --> 19:07.339
But I don't care.

19:07.364 --> 19:09.449
I have three really good friends.

19:09.474 --> 19:11.855
That's a lot. And they
all came to my party.

19:12.800 --> 19:13.800
Okay.

19:14.097 --> 19:15.722
Are you still liking your new school?

19:15.747 --> 19:17.575
'Cause I feel like you're
always telling Dad and I

19:17.599 --> 19:19.639
how much you love it and
how much fun you're having.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.168
Oh, yeah, my teachers are awesome.

19:21.193 --> 19:22.826
And at lunch, I hang out with Andrew.

19:22.851 --> 19:24.191
We're making a book of mazes.

19:25.003 --> 19:27.121
You are? That's awesome.

19:28.480 --> 19:32.136
(smacks lips) Randall, you
are the coolest kid I know.

19:32.161 --> 19:34.472
Thanks. Can I go pee now?

19:34.497 --> 19:35.621

20:40.281 --> 20:41.386
What, seriously?

20:41.608 --> 20:44.816
Jack, I just talked to
Randall and he is amazing.

20:44.841 --> 20:47.722
And I know that we can't
take credit for his genes,

20:47.747 --> 20:48.879
but we raised him.

20:49.118 --> 20:50.351
- We did that.
- Yeah.

20:50.376 --> 20:54.113
And he's this...
incredible little person.

20:54.138 --> 20:56.949
So maybe it wouldn't
be so bad to shape...

20:57.684 --> 20:59.136
another little incredible person.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.304
Ew.

21:08.113 --> 21:09.953
- Yep. Chips. Okay.
- Yeah, let's go get chips.

21:10.402 --> 21:15.392
Imagine you are a tree with
roots growing deeper...

21:16.249 --> 21:20.110
If a distraction emerges, just
acknowledge it

21:20.135 --> 21:22.657
and return to your stillness.

the bodies moving.

There we go.

21:43.456 --> 21:45.589

22:06.520 --> 22:08.153
Well, your horses can deal.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.173
Yeah, well, I can't.

22:10.701 --> 22:12.259
Your voice is annoying me, too.

22:13.182 --> 22:14.657
No, no, no. Hold on.

22:14.682 --> 22:16.657
Okay, um, I am not gonna be insulted

guy today... I'm just not.

22:19.907 --> 22:21.872
I need to get the hell
up out of this place.

22:21.897 --> 22:22.923
Good for you.

22:23.500 --> 22:26.376
This place is... pointless.

22:27.098 --> 22:28.032
I didn't say that.

22:28.057 --> 22:30.057
It's a total waste of money.

22:30.419 --> 22:33.212
So we're fat. I'm fat, you're fat.

22:33.237 --> 22:35.079
So what? What difference does it make?

22:35.246 --> 22:37.407
It's cells. We just have more of 'em.

22:37.432 --> 22:39.465
- Actually, it's more than that...
- People come here,

22:39.489 --> 22:40.892
lose a few pounds,

22:40.917 --> 22:42.931
learn how to roast
some Brussels sprouts.

22:43.319 --> 22:45.563
And then they go home
thinking they're transformed.

22:46.643 --> 22:47.720
But deep down...

22:48.865 --> 22:49.865
they're the same.

22:51.002 --> 22:52.002
It's a joke.

22:52.793 --> 22:54.251
People trying to change their lives

22:54.276 --> 22:55.767
is not a joke.

22:56.874 --> 22:58.341
People don't change.

22:59.239 --> 23:01.305
You know it and I know it.

25:34.664 --> 25:35.663
Let me... Let me see if I got this.

25:35.688 --> 25:38.271
You had two amazing women,...

25:38.296 --> 25:39.773
- and you let them both go?
- Yeah.

25:39.798 --> 25:40.949
I already know that much, thank you.

25:40.973 --> 25:43.906
Well, lucky for you, I am the king

25:44.395 --> 25:45.812
of romantic grand gestures.

25:46.945 --> 25:48.013
You really kind of are.

25:48.038 --> 25:49.048
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

25:49.073 --> 25:50.913
See, while you were out seducing women

25:50.938 --> 25:52.515
with your master race bone structure

25:52.540 --> 25:53.929
and your perfect man-bod,

25:54.027 --> 25:56.210
I was logging two solid decades

25:56.235 --> 25:58.171
of actually doing nice things for women

25:58.196 --> 25:59.374
so that they fall for me.

25:59.888 --> 26:00.976
And on top of <i> that...</i>

26:01.500 --> 26:02.859
And I'm not exaggerating here...

26:02.884 --> 26:04.835
I have seen every
romantic comedy ever made.

26:05.354 --> 26:07.780
So...  you just need to pick a girl,

26:08.987 --> 26:10.452
and I'm gonna help you win her back.

26:13.367 --> 26:14.367
Okay, I...

26:15.858 --> 26:17.374
- I pick, um...
- Yeah?

26:19.063 --> 26:20.328
I mean, they're both great. I-I...

26:20.352 --> 26:22.677
Okay, okay, Kevin,
Kevin, Kevin, look at me.

26:23.959 --> 26:26.545
A romantic gesture of this magnitude

26:26.570 --> 26:28.115
is only effective if it is directed

26:28.140 --> 26:30.201
at the love of your life.

26:30.549 --> 26:31.948
All right, the end
of <i> Notting Hill</i>

26:31.973 --> 26:33.990
completely falls apart
if Hugh Grant thinks

26:34.015 --> 26:36.349
that Julia Roberts is just kinda a'ight.

26:36.640 --> 26:37.983
All right? Then he's
just kind of annoying her

26:38.007 --> 26:39.993
at a press conference, right?

26:41.622 --> 26:42.545
I've never seen that movie.

26:42.570 --> 26:43.603
Shut up. What?

26:43.628 --> 26:44.660
- Never.
- What?!

26:45.743 --> 26:47.763
Alright, Kevin, close your eyes.

26:48.265 --> 26:50.898
- What are you gonna do?
- Close your eyes.

26:53.605 --> 26:56.630
All right, now, I want you to
picture the love of your life.

26:58.337 --> 27:02.139
Imagine that you have 30
seconds to win her back.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.654
One shot, three sentences.

27:06.156 --> 27:07.354
What are those sentences,

27:07.379 --> 27:09.013
and who are you saying them to?

27:15.741 --> 27:16.741
There it is.

27:16.919 --> 27:18.748
- I got it.
- I got... All right.

27:19.899 --> 27:21.146
- We're doing this.
- Okay.

27:21.171 --> 27:22.663
- Toby, you're a stud. You know that?
- That's what I've been trying...

27:22.687 --> 27:24.407
Oh, we're moving? Okay.
I'm getting the car.

27:25.990 --> 27:29.115
Say, uh... Hey, William,
I have a question.

27:29.224 --> 27:30.735
The only bad question is a question...

27:30.759 --> 27:32.492
Yep, got it. That's why I'm asking.

27:32.527 --> 27:34.527
Uh, we just went to
three different diners

27:34.562 --> 27:36.629
looking for your perfect egg cream.

27:36.664 --> 27:39.531
One had Hershey's
syrup instead of Fox's.

27:39.566 --> 27:40.710
The other one didn't
have any to-go cups.

27:40.734 --> 27:42.112
Sounds like a recap, not a question.

27:42.136 --> 27:44.836
My question is why,
after we finally found

27:44.872 --> 27:46.238
your perfect egg cream that passed

27:46.274 --> 27:48.840
your egg cream litmus
test, why, William...

27:48.876 --> 27:50.842
why are you not drinking it?

27:50.878 --> 27:52.410
It's not the right time yet.

27:52.435 --> 27:55.735
Oh, okay, no problem.
Then I got plenty of time.

27:56.116 --> 27:57.644
Nothing career-defining
going on at work...

27:57.668 --> 27:59.496
- Can we pull over right here?
- Right here?

27:59.521 --> 28:00.962
- Pull into this parking lot.
- Sure.

28:00.987 --> 28:02.230
Sure, that's...

28:03.300 --> 28:04.699
Mm-hmm.

28:11.359 --> 28:14.714
Okay. Now what?

28:16.701 --> 28:18.550
I was hoping to drive your car.

28:20.488 --> 28:21.271
You want to...

28:21.307 --> 28:22.940
Drive your car. Yes.

28:25.577 --> 28:26.876

something and push play?

28:59.943 --> 29:01.090
Mm-hmm.

29:08.150 --> 29:10.117
(mid-tempo jazz playing)

29:10.652 --> 29:11.809
Hmm. (chuckles)

29:24.265 --> 29:26.418
Uh, what's happening?

29:26.443 --> 29:27.788
When I was a little boy in Memphis,

29:27.812 --> 29:30.113
there was this record shop, Hoppy's.

29:30.729 --> 29:32.902
I hear they tore it down
a couple of years ago.

29:33.624 --> 29:35.496
When I was a kid, that was the place.

29:35.958 --> 29:37.028
They'd let you listen to any record,

29:37.052 --> 29:38.451
even if you wasn't gonna buy it.

29:39.605 --> 29:42.059
One of the owners... Mo
Moretti was his name...

29:42.855 --> 29:45.395
He could look at you and tell
what song you needed to hear.

29:46.509 --> 29:48.363
Every Saturday morning,
we would wait for Mo

29:48.388 --> 29:49.388
to open up shop.

29:49.970 --> 29:53.337
He'd drive up in his
all-black Cadillac Series '62,

29:53.615 --> 29:55.418

29:55.443 --> 29:57.371

37:48.517 --> 37:49.522
When you're ready.

37:51.371 --> 37:52.061
No, thanks.

37:52.086 --> 37:53.086
No, you don't see...

37:53.485 --> 37:54.881
See, you don't see it yet.

37:56.134 --> 37:57.134
But this?

37:58.951 --> 37:59.951
This is happening.

38:02.886 --> 38:04.358
Oh, but it's not.

38:04.966 --> 38:06.905
Oh, but it is.

38:11.697 --> 38:13.139
N-no, it's not.

38:15.109 --> 38:16.287
- Oh...
- (sighs)

38:17.013 --> 38:18.131
I can't move.

38:19.770 --> 38:22.069
I have to wash my
face but I cannot move.

38:22.094 --> 38:23.647
Will you wash my face for me?

38:23.672 --> 38:25.444
Oh, I can't. I'm dead.

38:25.469 --> 38:27.030
Three parties killed me.

38:29.194 --> 38:29.987
Hey, Bec?

38:30.012 --> 38:31.012
Yeah?

38:32.049 --> 38:33.592
The talks don't work anymore.

38:36.311 --> 38:38.287
I couldn't make Kate feel better.

38:39.058 --> 38:40.757
And that's like...

38:40.782 --> 38:41.819
my thing.

38:41.844 --> 38:42.844
You know?

38:43.483 --> 38:45.498
I tried, but it just... it didn't stick.

38:46.371 --> 38:47.514
(chuckles)

38:48.316 --> 38:49.991
We can't have another kid right now.

38:50.016 --> 38:51.016
No.

38:53.095 --> 38:55.475
I think the three of them are
only gonna get more difficult.

38:55.608 --> 38:56.764
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:56.978 --> 38:58.116
(exhales)

39:00.035 --> 39:02.975
I miss when Kevin used to
call hiccups "hee-bots."

39:03.000 --> 39:04.592
- (laughs)
- Remember that?

39:04.617 --> 39:06.405
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Hmm.

39:07.973 --> 39:10.491
I miss when you used to
look in the rearview mirror

39:10.516 --> 39:12.717
and they'd all be asleep
in their car seats,

39:12.742 --> 39:14.342
just mouths wide open. Ah.

39:14.627 --> 39:17.061
I miss when all of their
outfits used to match.

39:17.616 --> 39:18.616
Yeah.

39:20.603 --> 39:21.603
(kisses)

39:21.832 --> 39:23.420
(grunts, sighs)

39:25.218 --> 39:26.361
Hey, maybe we could at least...

39:26.385 --> 39:27.694
No. We're not getting a dog.

39:27.719 --> 39:28.741
No? Okay.

39:29.248 --> 39:30.715

39:34.741 --> 39:36.241

(sighing): Oh. Thank God.

39:38.211 --> 39:39.211
(chuckles)

39:39.498 --> 39:40.787
(whispers): Surprise attack.

39:41.006 --> 39:42.065
Surprise attack!

39:42.101 --> 39:43.537
(shouting, screaming)

39:45.194 --> 39:46.694
- Daddy!
- (laughs)

39:46.719 --> 39:48.620
- No, no, no!
- Oh, I got you!

39:49.142 --> 39:50.966
<i>I got a shield, I
got a human shield!</i>

39:51.014 --> 39:52.436
- Help me!
- I have a human shield!

39:52.461 --> 39:54.327
Oh, no, no! Whoa!

39:55.219 --> 39:56.640
It's all you, Will Hill.

39:57.104 --> 39:58.550
Oh, I think I'm getting
the hang of this, Randall.

39:58.574 --> 39:59.726
You got this.

40:00.158 --> 40:03.515
Yeah. You've been driving
for a good... 15 minutes, now.

40:03.540 --> 40:04.890
(Randall laughs)

40:04.915 --> 40:07.382
Ah, this is a dream
come true, right here.

40:08.246 --> 40:09.812
Thank you so much, Randall.

40:10.512 --> 40:12.015
- It's my pleasure.
- Wow.

40:12.040 --> 40:12.858
Watch me do this.
