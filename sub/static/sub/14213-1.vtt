01:02.262 --> 01:04.355
I've been waiting 3 years
for this one chance

01:05.632 --> 01:06.462
The only thing to prove

01:06.666 --> 01:08.156
is not my brilliance

01:08.334 --> 01:08.993
but my determination

01:09.169 --> 01:10.761
to regain the losses

01:13.339 --> 01:14.601
Kit, calm down!

01:16.543 --> 01:18.841
Don't call me Kit
answer "Yes Sir"

01:19.312 --> 01:20.609
Yes Sir!

01:23.149 --> 01:25.344
I haven't been a big brother
for a long time

01:26.653 --> 01:28.280
As brothers...

01:32.492 --> 01:36.588
Kit, you are not wrong

01:36.996 --> 01:38.088
We are on different routes

01:39.799 --> 01:42.029
You've picked the right way

01:53.346 --> 01:55.746
This is Chief Inspector Wu

01:56.149 --> 01:56.774
Inspector Chow

01:56.983 --> 01:57.381
Brother Ho

01:57.550 --> 01:58.744
Take a seat!

01:59.319 --> 02:00.115
Thank you, Sir!

02:00.453 --> 02:02.785
We have a case which hopefully

02:03.056 --> 02:05.320
you will consent to take up

02:06.126 --> 02:07.650
Interpol has information that
the headquarters

02:07.927 --> 02:09.827
of an international counterfeit operation

02:10.029 --> 02:11.326
has moved here

02:13.032 --> 02:14.761
It's a matter of face

02:15.135 --> 02:17.968
I want to crack it

02:18.271 --> 02:19.898
before I retire

02:24.043 --> 02:25.772
The few big operators

02:26.112 --> 02:28.012
we've already finished them off

02:28.915 --> 02:31.315
only this suspect is left

02:37.223 --> 02:39.384
The one who taught you everything: Lung

02:40.160 --> 02:41.957
15 years ago
Lung ruled over

02:42.128 --> 02:44.528
all counterfeit operations in SE Asia

02:45.231 --> 02:48.259
We do not rule out he is still in control

02:48.468 --> 02:48.991
Impossible!

02:50.103 --> 02:51.035
He's retired for over 10 years

02:52.205 --> 02:53.069
Are you that sure?

02:53.473 --> 02:54.735
He's not that kind of person

02:56.042 --> 02:57.532
A person can change his appearance

02:57.944 --> 03:00.242
but he can never
get rid of his criminal record

03:01.948 --> 03:04.610
Ho, you were in the business

03:04.984 --> 03:07.043
I want you to be an undercover
and investigate Lung

03:07.654 --> 03:08.313
I won't do it

03:11.090 --> 03:12.557
It's a matter of face

03:13.493 --> 03:15.120
Don't you want to do
something for society?

03:18.398 --> 03:19.763
I'm paying back now

03:21.234 --> 03:22.997
I think I've done my bit for society

04:25.531 --> 04:26.225
Mr. Lung

04:27.100 --> 04:28.328
Daddy, I'm scared

04:28.501 --> 04:29.195
Don't be afraid!

04:33.239 --> 04:33.534
Mr. Lung!

04:33.773 --> 04:35.297
How do you do?

04:36.242 --> 04:37.869
How are you?

04:38.144 --> 04:39.304
How are you?

04:39.612 --> 04:40.237
Good evening!

04:44.017 --> 04:44.847
How are you?

04:48.521 --> 04:48.885
Ko!

04:49.255 --> 04:49.778
Brother Lung!

04:53.726 --> 04:54.954
My daughter is very nervous

04:55.461 --> 04:56.393
No need to be

05:02.435 --> 05:04.369
I taught you right

05:04.604 --> 05:06.435
Your mother and I danced like this
20 years ago

05:06.739 --> 05:09.833
from the first step to the last
applause all the way

05:11.678 --> 05:13.612
Sometimes, you have to wait long
for the first applause

05:14.781 --> 05:18.046
If you did your best
someone will appreciate it

05:20.687 --> 05:21.711
This way, please!

05:21.921 --> 05:22.444
No, thank you!

05:35.902 --> 05:38.029
Do you know Mr. Lung?

05:38.705 --> 05:40.138
Yes, what's the matter?

05:40.907 --> 05:42.238
I worship him

05:42.442 --> 05:43.340
You worship him?

05:43.676 --> 05:45.940
I also enjoy watching people dance
like this

05:46.179 --> 05:48.773
I saw him dance 20 years ago

05:49.015 --> 05:51.677
At the time, not many people
could dance like this

05:51.884 --> 05:53.442
so he was quite a sensation

05:54.387 --> 05:55.615
I would really like to meet him

05:56.422 --> 05:57.514
I'll introduce you

05:58.691 --> 06:00.056
Someone wants to meet you
a secret admire

06:02.161 --> 06:04.652
I heard you
it hurts a little too

06:05.131 --> 06:06.598
I'm sorry, I'm Billie

06:07.200 --> 06:08.167
I don't recognize you

06:11.137 --> 06:11.933
It's alright

06:12.338 --> 06:14.772
but I'm sure you're the one

06:16.776 --> 06:18.676
Actually you haven't
changed much 20 years

06:23.216 --> 06:24.012
Stay calm

06:27.019 --> 06:28.714
Dad, my heel has broken off

06:28.955 --> 06:30.013
That's terrible

06:30.957 --> 06:31.821
What shall I do?

06:32.058 --> 06:33.753
Thinking of something

06:34.494 --> 06:35.188
Take your shoes off

06:36.229 --> 06:37.856
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

06:38.998 --> 06:39.965
This judges will feel sorry for you

06:41.501 --> 06:42.024
Go on!

06:49.409 --> 06:50.137
Take a seat!

07:14.767 --> 07:16.029
I can't tell anyone

07:17.036 --> 07:19.231
about the case I'm on

07:19.839 --> 07:20.806
not even you

07:24.277 --> 07:25.335
Don't worry, I'll be alright

07:29.916 --> 07:31.543
You take care

07:47.300 --> 07:49.564
Mr. Wong would like to say hello

07:50.069 --> 07:51.001
Brother Lung!

07:55.575 --> 07:56.166
Brother Lung!

08:06.586 --> 08:07.644
Good!

08:11.290 --> 08:12.848
Your daughter dances well

08:15.027 --> 08:18.519
No dancer will wear shoes next year

08:24.770 --> 08:25.498
Miss Lung!

08:38.183 --> 08:41.085
My Dad talks too much
Don't talk to him

08:41.386 --> 08:42.149
Uncle!

08:43.856 --> 08:45.323
Billie is here to see you

08:45.625 --> 08:45.920
Really?

08:46.158 --> 08:46.522
Uncle!

08:46.692 --> 08:47.351
Billie

08:47.527 --> 08:48.221
Why don't you two chat a little?

08:48.427 --> 08:48.825
OK

08:49.161 --> 08:51.459
This is for you
to wish you "fast winds"

08:53.032 --> 08:54.158
Wasn't going so well

08:54.367 --> 08:55.629
should be better now with this

08:56.903 --> 08:57.528
I'll put it away for you

08:58.271 --> 09:00.705
Do you like this ship?

09:00.873 --> 09:04.570
Sure. A nice young man too

09:04.977 --> 09:06.968
Billie says he wants
to tour the shipyard

09:07.480 --> 09:09.107
Yes, learn a little about shipyards

09:14.120 --> 09:15.849
I'm glad you're friends with Peggy

09:17.557 --> 09:20.390
As long as she's happy
I'll be grateful to you

09:22.028 --> 09:23.461
We cannot repay the bank

09:23.729 --> 09:25.788
The shipyard could be taken over anytime

09:27.567 --> 09:29.865
How much cash do we have
to payoff the staff?

09:30.636 --> 09:32.126
Not even a third of what's needed

09:32.538 --> 09:33.095
What are you listening to?

09:34.340 --> 09:35.534
You want to?

09:35.708 --> 09:37.767
They say someone has applied for
our winding up

09:40.146 --> 09:43.138
The only way is to give up
your shareholding

09:43.349 --> 09:44.008
and get some cash

09:44.517 --> 09:46.485
to tide us over

09:47.253 --> 09:47.685
Hey!

09:47.887 --> 09:49.286
Are you listening to me?

09:49.722 --> 09:50.347
Yes!

09:54.460 --> 09:55.324
Mr. Lung!

10:01.867 --> 10:03.027
What is it?

10:03.269 --> 10:04.668
I've come to deliver money to you

10:08.774 --> 10:11.800
Brother Lung
I've used all my shares

10:12.144 --> 10:14.806
to act as collateral against
Mr. Wong's bonds

10:15.815 --> 10:17.680
I've done my best towards the company

10:19.552 --> 10:22.146
If you let me have your shares too

10:22.822 --> 10:27.816
I'll withdraw the winding up application

10:29.895 --> 10:31.362
You think what you say is it?

10:32.098 --> 10:34.532
In our time, we had a code of behavior

10:34.967 --> 10:38.801
You respect me and the respect
is doubly returned

10:39.472 --> 10:41.531
Ko might have been confused
and was misled

10:42.408 --> 10:45.400
committing this error
without asking me

10:48.414 --> 10:51.008
You are not worthy of my respect
not my despise

10:51.550 --> 10:52.380
This is the way out

11:00.693 --> 11:03.423
Seems there's nothing more to say

11:04.964 --> 11:09.560
Nobody dare not give me face

11:15.875 --> 11:16.671
Brother!

11:16.909 --> 11:18.206
I haven't seen Kit for a long time

11:19.011 --> 11:20.945
He seems changed

11:21.647 --> 11:23.444
He says he's on a special mission

11:23.749 --> 11:28.345
After he's finished it
we'll change our names and identity

11:28.521 --> 11:29.783
and move somewhere else to live

11:30.923 --> 11:32.185
Did he say what mission he's on?

11:32.391 --> 11:34.791
No, but he's become very strange

11:35.261 --> 11:39.664
He was talking late last night
with a girl Peggy

11:41.600 --> 11:43.261
I'm afraid he'll leave me

11:46.105 --> 11:47.402
Why did you send Kit
as an uncover agent?

11:47.807 --> 11:49.172
Don't you know he'll be in danger?

11:49.742 --> 11:52.175
Kit has his own thinking
no one can stop him

11:53.779 --> 11:55.576
OK, I'll work with you

11:55.915 --> 11:57.974
Take Kit off this case

11:58.651 --> 11:59.618
Let me think about it

11:59.985 --> 12:01.714
Sung Chi Ho, I didn't force you

12:01.921 --> 12:02.717
you volunteered

12:02.955 --> 12:05.287
We all have to be responsible for
subsequent events

12:06.158 --> 12:07.022
When are you leaving me out?

12:07.727 --> 12:09.092
I'll arrange it

12:16.769 --> 12:17.463
Master!

12:30.449 --> 12:31.143
How did you get out?

12:31.884 --> 12:32.612
I escaped

12:33.486 --> 12:38.389
I have nowhere to go
I want to stick with you

12:46.165 --> 12:47.063
Give yourself up

12:50.069 --> 12:55.439
When a man has wronged
walk in with your head high

12:56.976 --> 12:58.637
and walk out with your head high

12:59.712 --> 13:02.044
I've left this business
for over 15 years

13:04.250 --> 13:08.812
I want to go straight
But someone is always after us

13:10.489 --> 13:14.949
I want to be clean
no one believes me

13:22.968 --> 13:28.565
You should have another choice

13:33.279 --> 13:34.211
Brother Wong!

13:34.380 --> 13:35.108
Mr. Chow

13:35.247 --> 13:35.838
Thanks for coming

13:36.148 --> 13:37.547
lmmigrating so soon?

13:37.750 --> 13:38.842
Let's not talk about it

13:39.852 --> 13:41.843
Brother Chung

13:46.458 --> 13:47.390
Mr. Chow

13:47.793 --> 13:49.192
Just help yourself

13:55.234 --> 13:56.667
What a coincidence!

13:56.902 --> 13:59.735
When you are not doing well

14:00.706 --> 14:02.264
Everybody looks at you like an exhibit

14:02.675 --> 14:06.270
So you should look at them the same way

14:09.515 --> 14:11.506
Dad says of all my boyfriends

14:11.884 --> 14:13.010
you're the most considerate

14:13.219 --> 14:13.844
Really?

14:14.186 --> 14:16.086
He loves the boat you gave him

14:16.322 --> 14:17.346
He asked me to thank you

14:18.991 --> 14:19.958
Wait for me

14:26.332 --> 14:26.923
Kit!

14:32.972 --> 14:33.529
Brother Wong!

14:39.778 --> 14:40.938
My name is Billie

14:41.580 --> 14:42.239
Billie!

14:44.183 --> 14:45.047
How come you're here?

14:45.351 --> 14:47.046
I'm doing exactly what you're doing

14:47.686 --> 14:48.345
What have you found out?

14:52.625 --> 14:53.182
And you?

14:54.960 --> 14:57.393
Wong & two gangs
want to get Lung's shipyard

14:58.631 --> 15:00.462
For what purpose
I don't know yet

15:01.300 --> 15:05.134
You get out of this
Let me handle it

15:05.771 --> 15:06.999
You're no fight for them

15:12.344 --> 15:16.333
I've started already
I must finish it

15:17.216 --> 15:18.547
I've done this before

15:19.518 --> 15:21.884
I know what will happen

15:27.893 --> 15:29.087
I used to be too irrational

15:30.663 --> 15:35.327
Maybe after this
I'll understand you better

15:42.641 --> 15:43.972
You're still so stubborn

15:46.578 --> 15:48.170
You all know my problem

15:48.314 --> 15:49.645
There's a note for you

15:58.190 --> 16:01.887
When I drop my cigarette, you shoot!

16:13.405 --> 16:15.032
Brother Lung!

16:18.310 --> 16:20.938
Brother Lung!

16:28.520 --> 16:31.512
I'm right here
what do you want?

16:31.590 --> 16:34.457
Don't get so mad

16:34.860 --> 16:37.090
I just want your company to pay up

16:37.529 --> 16:38.826
What game are you playing?

16:39.565 --> 16:42.625
You cheat me with such low down tricks

16:42.835 --> 16:43.597
You have no ethics

16:44.570 --> 16:46.003
You shut up
you have no right to speak

16:46.038 --> 16:46.504
You...

16:47.806 --> 16:50.297
Mr. Wong, I'll be responsible Ko's case

16:50.542 --> 16:51.702
The law will settle this

16:52.144 --> 16:55.204
Law? The law is up to me

16:55.714 --> 16:57.978
It's simple

16:58.150 --> 16:59.481
either sign these documents

16:59.785 --> 17:01.946
or take this bullet, up to you

17:04.022 --> 17:05.183
I don't believe
you have the guts to shoot

17:05.457 --> 17:06.481
Don't you believe it?

17:07.026 --> 17:10.655
Neither of us was that clean

17:10.963 --> 17:13.590
Why don't we bet on it?

17:13.832 --> 17:16.096
I'll bet responsible, leave Lung out

17:16.335 --> 17:16.892
Ko, watch what you do

17:17.069 --> 17:18.330
You want to settle, settle with me

17:18.537 --> 17:19.560
Watch it

17:19.704 --> 17:20.967
Move over, let me kill him

17:24.242 --> 17:24.641
What is it?

17:24.843 --> 17:25.867
Somebody's life is at stake

17:26.412 --> 17:26.935
Go in and check it out!

17:27.112 --> 17:27.510
Really?

17:29.181 --> 17:29.875
You started it, I'll play

17:30.115 --> 17:30.513
Put your gun down

17:30.682 --> 17:31.614
You don't care me, Lung!

17:31.784 --> 17:32.682
You think I have no ethics

17:33.318 --> 17:34.342
Ko, listen to me

17:34.620 --> 17:36.247
We can't solve things this way

17:36.588 --> 17:37.452
Brother Lung, let go!

17:38.290 --> 17:39.120
Don't!

17:39.324 --> 17:40.416
Let me kill him

17:41.326 --> 17:41.951
Be careful!

17:42.194 --> 17:42.956
Put the gun down

17:43.762 --> 17:45.992
Ko, don't!

17:57.376 --> 17:58.001
Brother Lung!

18:15.360 --> 18:16.418
Put it down

18:36.849 --> 18:38.441
Kit, take Peggy away from this

18:38.650 --> 18:39.207
Go on!

18:39.384 --> 18:40.681
Dad!

18:45.958 --> 18:48.392
Lung, let's go!

18:53.098 --> 18:56.625
Do you know what you just did?

18:56.935 --> 18:58.994
You killed someone

19:01.707 --> 19:05.302
I just want to know you're innocent

19:08.680 --> 19:09.840
Someone set it up

19:10.249 --> 19:12.012
It's no good

19:12.217 --> 19:15.516
No one believes him
everybody is after him

19:16.255 --> 19:17.847
He has to leave town

19:18.290 --> 19:19.279
Then you'll have to take it up

19:21.126 --> 19:23.321
This is against my principle

19:24.530 --> 19:27.124
Principles can be changed

19:27.366 --> 19:28.264
I do have a way to do

19:28.567 --> 19:30.501
I can put him on a boat tonight

19:31.270 --> 19:32.760
Thank you!

19:34.773 --> 19:36.707
I'm putting you on a boat tonight
Uncle Lung

19:40.712 --> 19:41.804
What about my daughter?

19:42.214 --> 19:43.181
I'll look after Peggy

19:43.815 --> 19:44.645
Rest assured, Uncle Lung

19:45.317 --> 19:47.911
Do you have any friends overseas?

19:50.355 --> 19:54.621
Yes! In New York!

19:54.793 --> 19:56.920
Fine, as long as you have a friend

20:01.567 --> 20:02.864
Why don't you take me home?

20:03.468 --> 20:04.765
Your home is not safe

20:18.817 --> 20:20.751
My girlfriend, Peggy!

20:24.056 --> 20:25.387
My wife, Jackie!

20:27.059 --> 20:28.993
Don't go...

20:31.430 --> 20:32.226
You cheated me

20:32.464 --> 20:34.432
Calm down, go inside

20:34.600 --> 20:35.692
Leave me!
Get in!

20:36.969 --> 20:37.458
Leave me!

20:38.437 --> 20:39.836
Don't like that, sit down!

20:40.372 --> 20:41.430
Leave me!
You sit down here!

20:42.274 --> 20:42.831
OK

20:46.111 --> 20:47.544
I lied, but not to hurt you

20:49.047 --> 20:49.775
I'm with the police

20:51.683 --> 20:53.344
We suspected your father
was trading illegally

20:54.419 --> 20:55.647
That's why I had to get near you

20:56.355 --> 20:57.287
You used me!

21:03.028 --> 21:03.790
Trust me!

21:05.964 --> 21:07.898
It's safer here

21:08.734 --> 21:09.928
You'd better explain

21:17.175 --> 21:18.836
What were you up to?
Tell me!

21:44.569 --> 21:45.365
Thank you!

21:46.638 --> 21:48.367
Go. Don't worry

22:01.620 --> 22:03.554
We should let Peggy meet
up with Lung in USA

22:04.056 --> 22:04.579
And you?

22:05.090 --> 22:06.921
I'll try to join them

22:08.960 --> 22:09.927
They wouldn't trust you

22:10.562 --> 22:11.256
I'll try anyway

22:13.298 --> 22:15.960
Watch Ko, he's real trouble!

22:17.002 --> 22:17.934
You take care too

22:18.403 --> 22:18.960
I will

22:41.560 --> 22:43.187
You really don't know
where your father is?

22:43.595 --> 22:44.459
No!

22:45.430 --> 22:46.988
Have any friends said where he is?

22:47.199 --> 22:47.995
No!

23:03.915 --> 23:06.383
Peggy! Peggy!

23:20.132 --> 23:23.397
Peggy is dead

23:46.057 --> 23:48.685
Many things are memorable

23:48.894 --> 23:53.263
I've put down all the incidents
in your lives

23:53.465 --> 23:55.660
into many stories

23:56.601 --> 23:58.831
Nothing much worth writing about

24:00.005 --> 24:01.836
It's not true

24:02.174 --> 24:04.369
the world
nowadays no longer

24:04.709 --> 24:07.439
has people who are friends like you are

24:14.586 --> 24:17.646
Like Mark
how many are there like him?

24:30.569 --> 24:32.400
Who's he?
Looks just like Mark

24:32.938 --> 24:36.704
He's Ken
Mark's twin brother

24:36.942 --> 24:39.342
He's a real tough cookie

24:39.578 --> 24:41.842
Used to be called King of Diamond Hill

24:42.280 --> 24:43.747
People shook at hearing his name

24:44.483 --> 24:47.919
Then he went straight
and traveled all over

24:48.286 --> 24:53.246
At 15, he landed in USA
and traveled from West to East

24:53.525 --> 24:57.256
Sweated it out to go straight
everybody respected him

24:57.562 --> 24:58.927
Said he had guts

25:20.352 --> 25:21.751
Hello, Four Seas Restaurant

25:22.287 --> 25:23.652
I'm Sung Chin Ho
calling from Hong Kong

25:23.989 --> 25:24.853
Can I speak to Ken

25:25.457 --> 25:27.186
Wait a minute!

25:28.793 --> 25:29.418
Ken will tell you off

25:29.594 --> 25:30.424
for dressing like this

25:30.562 --> 25:31.085
So what!

25:31.329 --> 25:32.660
There's a table, go and sit down

25:33.598 --> 25:34.189
Ken

25:35.400 --> 25:35.923
Table No.10

25:36.301 --> 25:38.633
Hong Kong call
from Sung Chi Ho, taking it?

25:38.870 --> 25:41.839
Tell him I'm busy, hold on

25:42.507 --> 25:44.372
Those two say it's too salty
want to change

25:46.177 --> 25:48.145
I'll change it
take this out first

25:49.080 --> 25:49.603
Keung

25:49.915 --> 25:51.610
I've got a lawyer working on your papers

25:51.816 --> 25:53.147
You can apply for your family soon

25:53.385 --> 25:54.682
Thank you, Ken!

25:54.920 --> 25:55.614
No thank you at all!

25:57.289 --> 25:58.779
So go slow on the salt
in the fried rice

26:00.058 --> 26:01.252
Those customers are really
making a fuss

26:01.393 --> 26:03.827
I will. I was worried about
being caught everyday

26:03.995 --> 26:04.962
so I got heavy handed

26:05.130 --> 26:05.926
I won't anymore

26:16.441 --> 26:17.305
Well, look good?

26:21.279 --> 26:21.802
What is it?

26:22.147 --> 26:23.045
Ken!

26:24.182 --> 26:25.809
Got a cold? Eyes gone blind?

26:26.418 --> 26:28.113
Serves you right
told you Ken would scold you

26:28.553 --> 26:31.078
Just want to imitate Mark, so suave

26:31.590 --> 26:32.955
We're not blind

26:33.391 --> 26:34.722
We just want to go with some boss

26:35.026 --> 26:36.084
You won't take us

26:36.728 --> 26:38.719
Look at you, like circus clowns

26:38.997 --> 26:40.362
Take if off and go have some soup

26:40.465 --> 26:41.227
Good, great

26:41.866 --> 26:42.764
What soup do you think it is today?

26:42.934 --> 26:45.095
This fucking rice stinks!

26:46.771 --> 26:47.430
Hey, where are you going?

26:47.639 --> 26:55.512
Where are you going?
Stay here. Don't go!

26:55.914 --> 26:56.903
Come here, you

26:57.082 --> 26:59.016
Hey, what are you doing?
Let me go!

26:59.217 --> 27:01.549
I want to talk to your
greasy manager, alright?

27:03.154 --> 27:05.179
Come on
Where's your fucking boss?

27:05.857 --> 27:09.293
I'm the boss
what can I do for you, sir?

27:09.461 --> 27:10.951
The fried rice stinks!

27:12.697 --> 27:15.860
Oh! Yeh, no problem
I can change another for you

27:16.134 --> 27:17.829
Keung, bring two more plates of fried rice

27:18.003 --> 27:18.731
More rice?

27:18.970 --> 27:20.096
Go on!

27:20.672 --> 27:22.640
Damn those foreigners

27:24.676 --> 27:26.735
Bobby has a gun

27:27.512 --> 27:28.501
I'm your protection

27:28.713 --> 27:29.441
Oh!

27:29.614 --> 27:30.740
And now you listen to me

27:30.982 --> 27:33.416
You will pay me
a thousand dollars a month

27:33.918 --> 27:35.886
I see!

27:36.855 --> 27:37.822
See up!

27:38.023 --> 27:39.354
I give you nothing

27:41.960 --> 27:43.427
I won't give you, shit!

27:43.695 --> 27:48.257
You don't pay me
and I'll blow up your restaurant

27:48.299 --> 27:51.268
You really mean that?
You mean that?

27:52.971 --> 27:54.700
You want to blow up my restaurant?

27:56.207 --> 27:57.936
You make me so nervous!

27:58.143 --> 28:01.738
I really scare about this
Mamamia!

28:02.213 --> 28:03.737
He wants to blow up my restaurant

28:04.482 --> 28:06.245
Shut up, you!

28:08.219 --> 28:09.618
What about that, my friend

28:10.155 --> 28:13.124
If you feel hungry
you come to my restaurant any time

28:13.358 --> 28:14.655
No problem

28:15.026 --> 28:17.995
What do you think?
What do you think?

28:20.131 --> 28:23.157
Oh yeah, he needs some money

28:24.536 --> 28:25.400
I got a quarter

28:25.770 --> 28:27.260
Take it or leave it
it's up to you

28:28.173 --> 28:29.299
What do you think?

28:30.942 --> 28:32.170
Asshole!

28:41.453 --> 28:45.389
What's matter with you?
You got a big problem?

28:46.591 --> 28:49.025
You don't like my rice?
You don't like my rice?

28:50.462 --> 28:53.192
My rice is good, tastes good

28:53.364 --> 28:54.126
You...

29:01.673 --> 29:03.573
What's wrong with the food?

29:08.213 --> 29:09.840
It is beautiful for me

29:12.183 --> 29:13.150
You want to try some?

29:14.152 --> 29:16.052
No?

29:16.221 --> 29:19.520
For you, rice is nothing

29:19.758 --> 29:24.252
But for us, rice just like
my father and mother

29:25.163 --> 29:27.290
Don't fuck on my family

29:33.304 --> 29:35.204
I am very hurt about it

29:39.577 --> 29:43.308
I feel sorry with my rice

29:52.957 --> 29:54.788
If you have any dignity

29:55.126 --> 29:57.526
Apologize to the rice right now

29:57.729 --> 29:59.026
Fuck your rice, and fuck you too

29:59.230 --> 30:01.926
Shoot him

30:04.035 --> 30:07.630
What are you doing? Stop it!

30:09.574 --> 30:14.068
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun! Drop it!

30:16.581 --> 30:20.813
Open your fucking mouth
and eat the rice

30:21.419 --> 30:22.249
Never!

30:22.520 --> 30:23.578
Eat up you bastard

30:26.858 --> 30:30.294
OK, drop the gun! Drop it!

30:32.430 --> 30:33.158
Are you talking to me?

30:33.364 --> 30:33.853
Yes!

30:34.866 --> 30:38.233
Wait a minute, let the asshole
eat the rice first

30:38.403 --> 30:40.371
No, no, you drop the gun first

30:40.572 --> 30:42.938
No, no, let him eat first

30:43.808 --> 30:44.672
Eat it up, damn you!

30:44.943 --> 30:46.501
You better eat that asshole
he means it

30:47.045 --> 30:49.513
If you don't
I'll blow your head off

30:49.714 --> 30:51.375
Eat up, go on!

30:51.616 --> 30:52.708
Come on!

30:55.954 --> 30:57.785
That's better, much better!

31:28.586 --> 31:33.147
15 years ago you said
if I were in trouble to come looking

31:33.391 --> 31:35.154
Didn't think you'd come looking for me

31:43.234 --> 31:44.064
Brother Lung!

31:45.236 --> 31:47.431
Sam!

31:48.706 --> 31:51.368
It used to seem so easy to kill someone

31:51.843 --> 31:53.936
Yet it seems so difficult
to save someone now

31:54.412 --> 31:55.674
but I believe in one thing

31:56.014 --> 31:57.914
if you are determined to be a good man
you'll make it

32:01.519 --> 32:03.009
You brat

32:03.354 --> 32:05.549
Come wash your hands

32:07.992 --> 32:10.358
A tattoo of over 10 years
cannot be washed away

32:11.062 --> 32:13.223
Some regular parishioners
dare not come in

32:57.141 --> 32:58.165
Hello, Ko!

32:58.409 --> 33:01.674
Oh good, where are you now?

33:02.246 --> 33:05.647
In New York, what's happening?

33:05.817 --> 33:06.977
It will soon become all clear

33:07.385 --> 33:08.409
I am collecting evidence

33:08.619 --> 33:09.483
How about my daughter?

33:09.921 --> 33:13.288
She misses you
I'll arrange for her to see you

33:13.658 --> 33:16.889
Do that as quickly as possible

33:17.362 --> 33:18.420
Give me your address

33:22.700 --> 33:25.430
Don't worry
I'll handle everything

33:25.703 --> 33:26.465
Take care of yourself!

33:32.410 --> 33:33.399
He's in New York

33:36.614 --> 33:38.138
God bless him

33:39.684 --> 33:41.242
He's a dead duck

33:41.519 --> 33:44.249
Let's continue, how much more
counterfeit do you need

33:44.489 --> 33:48.983
$60m, to supply Europe
and South America

33:49.260 --> 33:52.957
How do you intend
to ship the money out

33:53.231 --> 33:54.391
We have our own ships

33:54.932 --> 33:56.524
That's great
I'm confident then

33:57.035 --> 34:00.664
Same price, $38 for 100 notes

34:05.777 --> 34:08.337
I'll be able to see my daughter soon

34:08.713 --> 34:12.614
That's wonderful
told you not to worry

34:15.485 --> 34:18.353
This is for you, tastes good

35:35.066 --> 35:37.864
Sam!

35:51.449 --> 35:52.381
Who are you?

36:03.394 --> 36:05.919
You keep an eye on this guy
he is dangerous

36:52.243 --> 36:53.801
Help!
Stay cool man

37:16.323 --> 37:17.750
Get him ready for an electro-shock

37:18.002 --> 37:20.937
OK, I will
I think that will be the best thing

37:36.220 --> 37:39.212
Uncle Lung!

37:40.391 --> 37:41.380
Uncle Lung!

37:42.827 --> 37:43.987
Uncle Lung!

37:58.442 --> 38:03.072
Uncle Lung, we're home

38:30.574 --> 38:32.201
Dinner time

38:37.348 --> 38:39.248
I'm sure in you entire
stay in the States

38:39.483 --> 38:40.882
You have not had a more sumptuous meal

38:44.055 --> 38:47.149
Here, a sausage, no poison

38:52.663 --> 38:53.687
Chicken leg!

38:59.503 --> 39:00.595
Nail you down

39:01.272 --> 39:02.330
Help yourself!

39:15.186 --> 39:17.950
Diamond 2, got any more 2's
Get him!

39:18.756 --> 39:20.121
A Mr. Sung to see you

39:25.863 --> 39:27.194
I want to see Mr. Ko

39:28.599 --> 39:29.065
Brother Ho?

39:31.435 --> 39:32.925
When did you get out?

39:33.204 --> 39:33.670
Nice of you to visit us

39:33.904 --> 39:35.235
You really give me face

39:35.706 --> 39:37.867
He's the one who shot Big Boss Shing

39:38.075 --> 39:38.905
The whole business knows about it

39:39.477 --> 39:40.171
You speak too highly of me

39:40.344 --> 39:41.276
Let me present, Mr. Ko

39:41.479 --> 39:42.070
Mr. Ko!

39:42.980 --> 39:44.038
What can I do for you?

39:45.082 --> 39:49.577
I used to work with Mr. Lung
He used to look after me well

39:49.787 --> 39:52.654
Now, I've escaped and
want to work with him again

39:53.124 --> 39:55.524
but he's skipped town

39:56.093 --> 39:59.221
It's my bad luck
I just want to make some money

39:59.964 --> 40:02.091
So why come looking for me?

40:02.900 --> 40:04.595
I want to join your organization

40:05.936 --> 40:09.167
You're mistaken
All our business is legitimate

40:10.941 --> 40:14.843
Your background and mine
we both know

40:15.579 --> 40:17.069
If think I'd just turn up

40:17.715 --> 40:19.239
without checking it out

40:20.951 --> 40:22.612
Why do you speak like this?

40:23.187 --> 40:25.917
If there's money to be made
let's all make it

40:26.157 --> 40:27.624
If you're interested

40:27.792 --> 40:29.054
talk to Mr. Ko

40:29.660 --> 40:32.094
If there's a chance to let me join

40:32.630 --> 40:33.927
You can play at whatever you like

40:34.098 --> 40:35.030
That's settled then

40:35.800 --> 40:36.892
Give me some time to consider it

40:37.101 --> 40:38.762
We should all check out our credibility

40:41.639 --> 40:43.436
We speak again

40:43.941 --> 40:44.532
Good

40:45.676 --> 40:46.438
Mrs. Sung

40:46.644 --> 40:48.805
Get to husband to decide on a name

40:51.515 --> 40:52.675
Please come in, Mrs, Cheung!

43:33.911 --> 43:34.935
That's not very careful!

43:36.547 --> 43:40.244
Tough. Where are you from?

43:42.820 --> 43:44.219
Do I have to be from somewhere?

43:45.322 --> 43:46.311
Not even a word of thanks?

43:50.628 --> 43:51.788
You want to talk business?

43:52.062 --> 43:53.461
Talk business. Sure

44:16.153 --> 44:17.381
It doesn't do you any good not to eat

44:18.255 --> 44:20.348
You're not a baby
I won't make you eat

44:20.691 --> 44:22.249
You eat yourself

44:28.899 --> 44:30.025
Take something

44:30.567 --> 44:31.534
Go on!

44:46.717 --> 44:48.275
Whether we are husband
and wife or friends

44:48.485 --> 44:50.282
Brothers or sisters
whatever we are

44:52.723 --> 44:53.417
The worst is that I can't help you

44:54.391 --> 44:55.653
If you think there is not
a single good person left

44:55.859 --> 44:56.826
Who can help you?

44:56.994 --> 44:58.359
Why don't you help yourself!

45:01.432 --> 45:03.127
If you went to be ill
I'll be ill with you

45:04.968 --> 45:06.595
If you want to give up
I'll give up too

45:08.072 --> 45:09.835
If you want to starve
I'll starve with you

45:21.518 --> 45:23.008
This shit!

45:58.622 --> 46:00.055
Come on, baby

46:09.800 --> 46:11.358
Come on, come on

46:14.972 --> 46:21.969
Come on!

46:29.853 --> 46:31.218
So nice, let's eat

46:45.435 --> 46:48.734
Let's eat

47:07.724 --> 47:10.090
Wonderful!

47:30.881 --> 47:32.712
You forgot your case

47:39.857 --> 47:41.085
watch out!

48:11.622 --> 48:12.646
Let's look up Ken

48:31.775 --> 48:34.300
Damn, damn!

48:34.678 --> 48:36.168
Marco, notify everybody

48:36.580 --> 48:39.481
Get everybody here

48:39.683 --> 48:41.480
Fucking guineas

48:43.287 --> 48:44.311
There's nothing for you guys here

48:44.554 --> 48:45.077
Ken!

48:45.789 --> 48:47.120
Your problem is our problem

48:47.691 --> 48:50.421
I'm sorry to have let
this happen to you

48:50.627 --> 48:51.685
You go back!

48:51.929 --> 48:52.793
Kill them all

48:52.963 --> 48:54.590
You shut up!

48:55.365 --> 48:57.856
Give me the gun
give me the gun

48:58.168 --> 48:58.600
Ken!

49:00.203 --> 49:01.363
Be cool man!

49:01.605 --> 49:02.765
Why, Ken?

49:03.640 --> 49:04.834
Cool down!

49:54.324 --> 49:57.225
Let's go

50:01.365 --> 50:02.127
Ken!

50:02.399 --> 50:03.058
Don't follow me

50:03.266 --> 50:04.665
Go home

50:04.901 --> 50:07.199
Let us help you

51:13.336 --> 51:14.360
You've finally thought it out

51:14.671 --> 51:15.763
Yes!

51:16.339 --> 51:17.966
If there's money to be made

51:18.175 --> 51:19.574
open up the doors

51:19.776 --> 51:21.243
I really want to work with you

51:22.179 --> 51:23.043
Do you trust me now?

51:23.280 --> 51:26.772
But, all hearts are different
we must be careful

51:27.050 --> 51:29.450
We must understand one another better

51:29.886 --> 51:31.615
Test our sincerity

51:34.858 --> 51:35.722
How do we do that?

51:37.794 --> 51:39.489
I want you to get rid of someone for me

51:40.363 --> 51:43.161
He could do us great harm

51:46.036 --> 51:48.630
He says he's one of us

51:50.440 --> 51:52.135
Yet I know he's an undercover agent

51:53.410 --> 51:55.207
You kill him for me later

52:25.242 --> 52:26.072
I'm sorry, brother

52:53.336 --> 52:55.861
Oh, it's Billie

52:56.573 --> 52:58.541
You want to make money
just let me know

52:58.909 --> 53:01.070
I've always liked your style

53:02.712 --> 53:05.203
Mr. Ko, your status
is somewhat different now

53:05.582 --> 53:08.050
It's difficult to talk to you
Let's deal

53:08.385 --> 53:09.716
Sure!

53:10.720 --> 53:11.482
Chong!

54:04.441 --> 54:07.274
I know you're an agent

54:07.611 --> 54:09.476
You want to get me?

54:09.746 --> 54:10.576
An agent!

54:11.147 --> 54:12.637
If I were one, I would
have killed you already

54:12.882 --> 54:14.440
I don't need to take this shit

54:15.385 --> 54:17.819
If you don't believe me, do it

54:17.988 --> 54:18.886
Let his wish come true

54:22.325 --> 54:24.623
You want to play
I'll play with you

54:25.295 --> 54:26.353
If you've got the guts
shoot me

54:26.563 --> 54:27.530
Otherwise I'll go to the police

54:28.265 --> 54:28.959
Chong!

54:29.165 --> 54:29.893
Let me do it

55:01.164 --> 55:03.689
Take another shot
or else he won't believe it

55:05.902 --> 55:06.664
Go on!

55:06.836 --> 55:08.770
Get rid of him

55:13.143 --> 55:17.443
Big brother
between the two of us

55:18.982 --> 55:20.677
It's enough that he trusts one

55:24.821 --> 55:27.119
Shoot!

55:48.912 --> 55:50.607
Actually, we haven't
investigated this kid

55:51.181 --> 55:52.512
We just wanted to test you

55:54.017 --> 55:56.144
Welcome to the company

55:58.355 --> 55:59.117
Thank you!

56:55.412 --> 57:03.012
Kit, Kit...

57:04.120 --> 57:05.382
This is your brother

57:14.597 --> 57:15.427
Miss, where is the emergency ward?

57:30.380 --> 57:32.075
Doctor...

57:32.382 --> 57:34.043
Prepare to operate

57:34.250 --> 57:36.047
Get him inside, quick

57:36.252 --> 57:37.116
Get him inside

57:37.487 --> 57:40.081
Please, hurry up, will you

57:40.390 --> 57:41.550
You can't go in, wait outside

58:20.964 --> 58:22.522
How's Kit?

58:22.732 --> 58:24.996
He's wounded
the doctors are working on him

58:45.855 --> 58:46.583
He's ok

58:46.856 --> 58:48.346
Luckily the bullet went through

58:48.691 --> 58:49.589
Please feels relieved

59:25.762 --> 59:26.751
Good luck

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:17.039
What's her name? Name?

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:23.814
You daughter is dead

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:27.550
She's dead

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.257
Wake up, will you
Wake up!

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:42.601
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life like this?

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:12.524
Don't torture yourself

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:18.636
Everybody will be so hurt
to see you like this

01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:25.370
The Lung of yester years

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:29.178
could face anything

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:34.616
and now, you can't even
walk out the door

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:40.854
Why can't you face reality?

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:44.190
Why?

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.306
You might as well be dead

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:01.316
And my sweat over these years
were blown away too

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:11.653
I have no regrets
I need no sympathy

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:16.788
Not like you, waiting to die
looking for pity

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:27.071
I am still in control

01:02:28.444 --> 01:02:30.412
If you do not admit defeat

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.774
fight back with me

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:34.641
There's no such thing in this world
as "Forced to"

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:38.679
Fuck you!

01:03:00.209 --> 01:03:01.198
Get out!

01:03:14.323 --> 01:03:15.654
There's only one way out

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:18.458
and you're coming with me

01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:21.560
If we don't fight

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:24.465
we'll both die here

01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:28.629
If we win
we'll start all over again

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:31.367
I know you can do it, come on!

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:32.701
No, don't, don't make me!

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:35.804
No, don't force me!

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:53.547
No...

01:05:43.973 --> 01:05:49.309
Peggy, I'm right here
don't be afraid

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:50.877
Dad's right here

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:55.848
I want to see you

01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:00.787
Peggy!

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:54.875
Ken!

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:52.328
Why... Why is it so difficult
to be a good person?

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.543
This is after all not our own place

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:15.087
Many try to leave home at all costs

01:08:16.024 --> 01:08:17.219
Many want to go home

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:19.960
Some...

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:25.032
Cannot even find
a temporary place to rest

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:33.908
One's home is always better

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:37.202
Will you come back?

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:45.545
Sure, to take some soup

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.365
You're prejudiced

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.104
keeping so much of Mark's things

01:09:04.273 --> 01:09:05.763
Sure. He treated me the best

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.341
Just like this overcoat
over 40 bullet holes

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:10.033
it's a reminder for you to behave

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:12.305
So that you won't
come crawling back in one

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:20.953
Lung!

01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:25.883
I've been waiting for you to come back

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:30.526
Ho!

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:35.133
Look who's here?

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:39.265
Mark?

01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:40.465
It's Ken!

01:09:44.446 --> 01:09:46.345
Ken!

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:30.619
I'm sorry, I couldn't protect Peggy

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:32.626
I can only send her flowers everyday

01:10:41.537 --> 01:10:45.803
Thank you. It's God's will

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:48.007
Uncle Lung

01:10:49.678 --> 01:10:51.509
Kit did his best

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:55.917
It's been hard on you

01:10:58.153 --> 01:10:59.984
I don't care now

01:11:12.968 --> 01:11:13.900
Why are you looking at me?

01:11:15.471 --> 01:11:16.369
You resemble someone

01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:17.635
Someone dead?

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:20.736
Your brother?

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.504
Don't speak of the dead in a cemetery

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:29.884
I'm Sung Chi Ho's brother Sung Chi Kit
How're you?

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:32.217
Oh! So you're big brother Kit!

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:35.122
Just call me Kit

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:36.083
I'm Ken!

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:37.688
Hi, big brother Ken

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:40.655
Come on, we're both younger brothers

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:41.693
Call me Ken

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:46.029
What happened? Got hit?

01:11:46.268 --> 01:11:47.200
In the line of duty

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:49.530
Just admit you got hit
in the line of duty...

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:52.171
You're just like your brother
a real square

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:53.636
You're like Mark too
quick tongue

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:56.569
Kit!

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:58.813
Jackie needs you right now
go home

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:13.518
Why don't we let Kit join us?

01:12:14.196 --> 01:12:16.289
Maybe he has more information for us

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:18.530
An extra hand can sure help

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:20.934
Whatever you say?

01:12:36.452 --> 01:12:37.282
I can't figure it out

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:40.852
What does Ko want with the shipyard?

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.384
I suspect he is using it
as a counterfeit headquarters

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:45.017
Put the blame on Uncle Lung

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:48.655
He needn't kill Lung
just make him go crazy

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:50.999
I'll burn up the shipyard

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:56.737
My life's work
No one can destroy it

01:12:57.473 --> 01:13:01.967
If it has to be done
I'll do it myself

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:04.169
The main thing is to get
evidence against them

01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:05.176
To clear you

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:06.543
Either we don't get involved

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:08.949
or we do, in a big way

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:14.982
Got any clues?

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:18.592
A New York buyer is in town

01:13:18.994 --> 01:13:22.122
He has a deal with Ko

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:22.990
OK

01:13:23.332 --> 01:13:24.663
when they arrived the headquarter
we'll catch them at it

01:13:29.271 --> 01:13:30.329
Ken!

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:37.674
Thanks, Uncle Lung!

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:40.548
How sweet

01:13:43.819 --> 01:13:44.717
Big brother!

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:48.616
For you

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:51.924
I don't like oranges

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:22.013
What is it?

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:25.121
A shooting star

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:28.630
It's only a firefly

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.766
In the police, it's unlucky
to see a shooting star

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:37.629
Bullshit, what's the point
if you know you'll die

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:45.408
The first time you saw it
was in a cemetery

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:49.074
The second time we see it together again

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:51.441
Such misfortune

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:56.419
So what? Are you worried?

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:03.160
I'm not worried
I'm very worried

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:06.164
I'm worried that
before this case is over

01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:07.266
I'll be dead

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:10.462
Do you have much unfinished business?

01:15:12.474 --> 01:15:14.032
You have to act with panache

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:17.935
Softly as I leave you

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:20.112
Softly as I came

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:24.374
Not taking with me
any trace of the clouds

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:27.685
Bullshit!

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:34.384
Who are those people?

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:36.127
Looks like printers

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:40.763
Go back to the shipyard
and get them started

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:41.993
I'll take delivery tomorrow

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:44.337
You go too

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:46.608
It's about time

01:15:46.775 --> 01:15:47.764
Let's go!

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:53.506
Here comes the boss

01:16:00.989 --> 01:16:01.785
Boss!

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:03.753
Hurry it up

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:05.393
Get a move on

01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:08.759
How much do you think we'll make?

01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:10.521
Enough to buy a few night clubs

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:23.744
You've got the nerve to steal

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.406
Don't!

01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:28.939
Don't look about, get to work

01:16:29.551 --> 01:16:30.609
Watch them. They know how to slack

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:49.331
Surely the counterfeit headquarters
are at the shipyard

01:16:49.738 --> 01:16:51.205
Ko has been running it

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.367
Then notify the police

01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:54.633
and clear Uncle Lung's name

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:55.333
Right!

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:56.700
It can't be that simple

01:16:57.479 --> 01:16:58.741
I feel something is wrong

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:00.244
I saw it myself
don't you believe me?

01:17:00.983 --> 01:17:01.779
No!

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:14.993
Ko, this is Lung!

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:17.790
I'm back

01:17:20.035 --> 01:17:23.766
Brother Lung, are you ok?

01:17:23.972 --> 01:17:28.409
Yes, fine thanks!

01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:42.546
Kit, I'd like to talk to you

01:17:44.693 --> 01:17:46.854
Leave this case

01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:48.292
I don't want you to get hurt

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:50.620
Jackie is in hospital

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:51.389
Really?

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.624
She's in room 704

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:54.426
At a time like this

01:17:54.803 --> 01:17:56.566
She needs support

01:18:41.983 --> 01:18:42.813
Ko Ying Pui

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:47.280
Go!

01:20:09.437 --> 01:20:10.199
What have you found?

01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:12.166
There's no one here
We've been had

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:14.272
That's terrible

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:17.701
Mr. Ko, we've notified the police

01:20:18.547 --> 01:20:20.071
You think I really trusted Sung Chi Ho?

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:22.375
I set a few guys up
and got rid of them

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:23.482
Nice and clean

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:38.155
Let's get going!

01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:39.298
Let's go!

01:20:39.734 --> 01:20:41.759
The back door
the police are here

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:54.348
We want Lung alive

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:20.074
Hurry, get in!

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:21.874
You go first

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:22.701
Let's go together

01:21:22.844 --> 01:21:24.937
You go, look after Uncle Lung!

01:23:37.879 --> 01:23:38.402
There's gunfire

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:41.611
What's happened?

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:55.455
Get in!

01:24:20.655 --> 01:24:21.849
I really got it

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:23.883
Are you scared?

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:27.192
I'm not scared, I'm very scared

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:31.225
Then drive faster or
I won't make it

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:32.024
Yes, Sir!

01:24:33.568 --> 01:24:35.832
Ko's basement is really the headquarters

01:24:36.938 --> 01:24:37.927
I finally finished this case

01:24:38.273 --> 01:24:41.174
Yet crime goes on
so what if you cracked this one

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:44.010
Someone's bound to. Carry on

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:47.577
Right, just you to handle it

01:24:50.351 --> 01:24:52.251
Kit

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:55.081
Stop the car. I have to call

01:24:55.323 --> 01:24:57.655
We're nearly at the hospital

01:24:58.960 --> 01:24:59.949
There's no time

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:07.831
Room 704 please

01:25:12.907 --> 01:25:14.807
Ho, this is Ken

01:25:16.411 --> 01:25:18.208
Oh, fine, he's right beside me

01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:19.973
Let me talk to Jackie

01:25:21.216 --> 01:25:24.242
Wait a minute

01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:28.847
Jackie, is it a boy or a girl?

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:29.852
A girl

01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:34.756
Oh, a girl, what does she weigh?

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:40.824
6lbs 3ozs, she's really pretty

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:48.909
6lbs 3ozs, no small

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:51.670
Mark and I weighed
less than 6lbs together

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:55.680
Does she look like you or me?

01:25:56.084 --> 01:25:58.518
Like me
But her eyes are like yours

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:06.451
She says the baby's real pretty
with eyes like mine

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:07.854
Must be a pretty baby
judging by her father

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:19.030
Bring her over, let me talk to her

01:26:19.307 --> 01:26:22.276
Don't be silly, she can't talk yet

01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:23.974
She can only cry

01:26:26.514 --> 01:26:28.209
Even that, I want to hear it

01:26:30.985 --> 01:26:35.854
Hey, why aren't you talking?

01:26:37.725 --> 01:26:41.058
Oh, I'm really happy

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:45.761
If you want to see her that much
come quickly

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:48.301
I'm coming

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:55.901
We haven't named her yet

01:26:59.147 --> 01:27:03.208
Kit, you haven't thought of a name yet

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:10.216
Sung Ho Yin
(The spirit of righteousness)

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:24.565
<i>Don't ask me about today</i>

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:29.869
<i>No need to know it and no need to ask</i>

01:27:31.212 --> 01:27:34.079
<i>Reasonable or not?</i>

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:37.084
<i>How to make a judgment?</i>

01:27:37.819 --> 01:27:42.813
<i>Don't want to think</i>
<i>to remember or to know!</i>

01:27:44.859 --> 01:27:49.956
<i>Don't ask me about my life</i>

01:27:51.132 --> 01:27:55.466
<i>No need to mention the past</i>

01:27:56.704 --> 01:27:59.696
<i>With or without love</i>

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:02.736
<i>Don't ask me</i>

01:28:03.144 --> 01:28:10.607
<i>Don't want to care</i>
<i>to regret or to understand</i>

01:28:17.725 --> 01:28:19.215
Watch out!

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:26.324
Kit...

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:41.442
<i>I'll be with you</i>
<i>to find a better tomorrow</i>

01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:47.779
<i>Don't ask me about sad things</i>

01:28:48.556 --> 01:28:52.993
<i>No need to say it</i>
<i>don't even mention it</i>

01:28:54.128 --> 01:28:56.995
<i>This, that</i>

01:28:57.398 --> 01:28:59.992
<i>Just couldn't help it</i>

01:29:00.601 --> 01:29:06.130
<i>Nobody knows the inside story</i>

01:29:06.674 --> 01:29:10.701
<i>Nobody knows</i>

01:29:57.792 --> 01:29:59.783
Uncle Kin. Go home!

01:30:00.128 --> 01:30:01.254
I can help

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:07.724
I've prepared a boat for your departure

01:30:08.202 --> 01:30:08.896
It's not necessary

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:36.696
Ho, Kit fell from here

01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:53.462
He must have taken the wrong medicine

01:32:53.668 --> 01:32:55.135
These grenades are really something

01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:57.101
Have to watch out this time

01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:10.214
No... sorry...

01:33:30.605 --> 01:33:31.469
Can't go on

01:33:33.975 --> 01:33:35.567
Let those outside take care of it

01:33:37.979 --> 01:33:39.776
You want to get away

01:33:46.487 --> 01:33:47.283
This is for you

01:34:33.067 --> 01:34:35.661
you get $100,000 for each one you kill

01:36:06.994 --> 01:36:07.756
Brother

01:36:09.396 --> 01:36:10.658
Uncle Kin, what kind of bomb is that?

01:36:10.965 --> 01:36:11.795
So powerful!

01:36:11.966 --> 01:36:13.831
Still have more powerful one, wanna try?

01:36:14.034 --> 01:36:14.625
No

01:36:14.769 --> 01:36:15.394
I go and get it for you

01:36:15.636 --> 01:36:17.604
No

01:36:43.364 --> 01:36:45.298
Ko!

01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:11.523
Are you alright?

01:37:14.161 --> 01:37:15.890
Give me a gun!

01:37:36.183 --> 01:37:36.945
Ho!

01:37:45.826 --> 01:37:47.088
Kin!

01:38:02.943 --> 01:38:03.910
Lung!

01:38:15.623 --> 01:38:16.612
Ko Ying Pui!

01:39:53.687 --> 01:39:54.676
Are you alright?

01:40:02.796 --> 01:40:04.161
Ko Ying Pui!

01:40:04.465 --> 01:40:05.363
Let him go!

01:40:10.971 --> 01:40:12.404
You're so serious about everything

01:40:13.007 --> 01:40:16.235
You think a good man
always has a good ending?

01:40:27.721 --> 01:40:31.657
You think a bad man
always has a good ending?

01:40:40.567 --> 01:40:42.125
Are you alright?

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:45.501
I don't need you to save me

01:40:47.007 --> 01:40:49.032
Yes. We're not right

01:40:50.544 --> 01:40:53.980
We're dying. Can we leave

01:40:55.049 --> 01:40:56.573
If you want to go

01:41:12.032 --> 01:41:15.968
Go back first, go on

01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:44.628
Put the guns down

01:41:45.332 --> 01:41:48.301
Inspector Wu
you'd better not retire

01:41:49.837 --> 01:41:51.566
There's a lot for you to do yet

01:41:59.079 --> 01:42:02.048
We miss you Ken, are you alright?

01:42:02.583 --> 01:42:05.143
We're looking after the
Restaurant really well

01:42:05.419 --> 01:42:06.943
There are more customers than before

01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:09.355
You'll be very pleased
when you come back
