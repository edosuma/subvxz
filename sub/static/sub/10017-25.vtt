00:40.600 --> 00:41.964
Carter?

00:42.134 --> 00:44.860
Carter? Carter, wake up!

00:45.033 --> 00:49.056
GSW coming in. Benton's in
surgery and Greene's got an MI.

00:49.233 --> 00:51.289
Carter! Let's go!

01:05.497 --> 01:08.259
Put a.357 in his mouth
and pulled the trigger.

01:08.431 --> 01:12.157
Two large bore IVs, 15 liters O-2,
BP 80 over 50, pulse 56.

01:12.330 --> 01:15.160
GCS 10. He's cyanotic.
Blood loss at least a liter.

01:15.330 --> 01:18.625
- Where's Benton?
- Still up with that knife wound.

01:18.796 --> 01:20.921
- He's hard to ventilate.
- No gray matter.

01:21.129 --> 01:23.561
Pupils sluggish.
Thought you were out of here.

01:23.763 --> 01:25.058
This is my last day.

01:25.628 --> 01:27.390
- Where's his face?
- On the dining room wall.

01:27.662 --> 01:30.719
- Oh, sweet Jesus.
- Help her to the waiting room.

01:30.894 --> 01:34.826
- Oh, God. God!
- Ma'am, please.

01:35.528 --> 01:38.049
I didn't think he knew
where I kept my gun.

01:38.227 --> 01:40.785
Pulse ox 70.
He's gonna need an airway.

01:40.961 --> 01:43.688
You've done it before.
Get somebody down here.

01:43.861 --> 01:46.655
- Who?
- Tackle anyone in a white coat.

01:46.826 --> 01:50.554
Oh, boy. I hope medical
malpractice covers this.

01:50.726 --> 01:53.692
7.5 ET tube. Suction.

01:55.059 --> 01:57.684
No, no. Damn it,
I can't see a thing. Bag him.

01:58.892 --> 02:02.881
PCO-2's 60, PO-2's 55, pH is 7.20.

02:03.059 --> 02:05.455
- Diminished breath sounds.
- Where is everybody?

02:05.624 --> 02:08.090
- He needs a crike.
- I can't do it.

02:08.890 --> 02:10.720
Really, I can't.

02:11.857 --> 02:14.221
Somebody do something.

02:18.890 --> 02:20.856
All right, get the crike tray.

02:25.656 --> 02:27.122
- Versed? Norcuron?
- No, no.

02:27.323 --> 02:30.686
If I paralyze him
and don't get the crike he dies.

02:31.489 --> 02:34.751
Drape! Can someone please
hand me a sterile drape?

02:44.155 --> 02:46.619
Is that the membrane?
Horizontal or vertical?

02:46.787 --> 02:49.617
Horizontal. No,
vertical skin incision first.

02:49.787 --> 02:53.310
Then cut horizontally through
the membrane. I'm sure.

02:53.487 --> 02:55.783
Thyroid's gotta be
in there somewhere.

02:55.953 --> 02:58.748
- Okay, horizontal.
- All right, give me the bullet.

02:58.920 --> 03:02.477
Fourteen-year-old male with
self-inflicted GSW to the mouth.

03:02.653 --> 03:05.413
He's had four units. BP's 70 over 50.

03:05.585 --> 03:09.881
Pulse is 54. Tried to intubate,
but there's too much blood.

03:10.052 --> 03:12.744
- I started a cricothyroidectomy.
- Did you paralyze him?

03:12.918 --> 03:14.975
- No.
- Good boy. Good boy.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.674
All right.

03:18.918 --> 03:22.782
Get a hook. Come on.
6.0 trach tube. Let's move.

03:22.951 --> 03:25.575
Call Radiology,
tell them we're on our way.

03:27.284 --> 03:30.273
Bag him. Come on, let's move.

03:30.450 --> 03:33.347
Let's pack it, stop all this bleeding.

03:37.449 --> 03:40.778
- So you were gonna do the crike?
- Yeah.

03:40.949 --> 03:43.142
- All right. Malik?
- Yo?

03:43.315 --> 03:46.474
Get Head and Neck out of bed.
This is their lucky day.

03:46.648 --> 03:50.081
- Wrong choice?
- Nope. Come on, let's get him up.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.109
Last day, right?

04:02.014 --> 04:06.241
Don't forget to turn in your lab coat
and I.D. You get your deposit back.

06:06.034 --> 06:11.023
Chloe, you need to do the laundry.
The detergent's in the closet.

06:11.201 --> 06:14.962
Oh, my God.
Chloe, can you hear me, please?

06:17.567 --> 06:22.362
- She's finally asleep.
- Were you up all night again?

06:22.533 --> 06:25.693
Oh, gosh, I hope it stops raining
before the wedding.

06:26.765 --> 06:29.629
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

06:29.798 --> 06:33.161
Yes. Chloe, yes you are.

06:33.331 --> 06:36.593
- I'm not strong enough, Susie.
- Chloe, you're doing great.

06:36.765 --> 06:40.594
I'm late. Please do the laundry.
The machines are in the basement.

06:40.764 --> 06:44.787
The wedding starts at five,
so I have to be back here by three.

06:44.964 --> 06:46.861
Bye, little one.

06:47.796 --> 06:50.285
- Three o'clock.
- Three, yeah.

07:00.662 --> 07:02.560
Single car TC, no seat belt.

07:02.729 --> 07:05.286
Complaining of chest pain,
IV started.

07:05.462 --> 07:08.257
Go see her. Tell her how you feel.

07:08.427 --> 07:11.087
- I have to know how I feel.
- Oh.

07:11.262 --> 07:13.193
Yeah. "Oh."

07:13.361 --> 07:16.418
- Maybe it's for the best.
- Except for Jake.

07:16.594 --> 07:19.990
- Yeah, and except for Rachel.
- Yes.

07:20.827 --> 07:24.224
- Who are they?
- Ah, new meat!

07:24.393 --> 07:27.154
Medical students.
This way, children.

07:27.325 --> 07:29.985
Mark, a drunk MVA in Trauma One.

07:30.859 --> 07:35.291
Carter, get the attempted suicide's
mother up to the O.R.

07:35.459 --> 07:38.687
- How is he?
- Just tell her he's in surgery.

07:38.858 --> 07:41.756
- Peter, I'm sorry about your mother.
- Yeah, thanks.

07:41.925 --> 07:44.413
Carter, I need your
course evaluation by noon.

07:44.591 --> 07:47.579
Your assessment
of your ER trauma rotation.

07:47.757 --> 07:52.486
- I get to grade you?
- Put it in Dr. Hicks' box.

07:52.657 --> 07:56.089
Is he joking? Oh, there is a God.

07:56.257 --> 08:00.518
- Pulse, thready 120. Resp 36.
- She's in shock. BP 70 over 50.

08:00.689 --> 08:03.712
Hit a parked car. No seat belt.
Bent the steering wheel.

08:03.890 --> 08:07.117
- Name's Bonnie Curtis.
- No sign of head trauma.

08:07.288 --> 08:10.016
Pulse ox is only 85.
Blood glucose is normal at 110.

08:10.189 --> 08:13.279
Bonnie? Bonnie, do you know
where you are?

08:13.455 --> 08:15.818
- God...
- She's drunk.

08:15.988 --> 08:19.477
- I need a cigarette.
- Do you know where you are?

08:19.655 --> 08:21.586
Get me a damn cigarette!

08:21.754 --> 08:24.549
CBC, Chem-7,
cardiac enzymes, EKG.

08:24.721 --> 08:28.846
- Blood alcohol?
- Sure. Get a chest and C-spine now.

08:29.720 --> 08:33.345
"The resident helped you achieve
competency with procedures."

08:33.520 --> 08:36.042
Yes, he did. That's a four.

08:36.219 --> 08:40.480
"The resident made himself available
to answer questions."

08:40.652 --> 08:43.583
- No. Two?
- I'd go for one.

08:43.751 --> 08:46.842
- Seems kinda harsh.
- We're talking about Benton here.

08:47.018 --> 08:48.449
One.

08:48.618 --> 08:53.516
"The resident gave you constructive
criticism of your performance."

08:53.683 --> 08:55.206
Constructive?

08:55.384 --> 08:58.475
- Do they have negative numbers?
- There's a zero.

08:58.651 --> 09:00.343
Zero it is.

09:00.517 --> 09:03.278
- That's it.
- What's the total?

09:03.450 --> 09:06.178
- Sixteen.
- Out of a possible...?

09:06.350 --> 09:09.679
Forty. Maybe I ought to go
a little easier on him.

09:09.849 --> 09:12.679
He turned in his evaluation
of you last week.

09:12.849 --> 09:15.576
Sixteen it is.
Where's Dr. Hicks' box?

09:16.549 --> 09:19.572
- What've you got?
- Single-car accident, no seat belt.

09:19.749 --> 09:21.577
Hit the steering wheel, drunk.

09:21.748 --> 09:23.907
- She's shocky.
- Internal bleeding?

09:24.081 --> 09:27.444
Abdomen soft, non-tender,
no rebound or guarding.

09:27.614 --> 09:32.343
Normal bowel sounds.
Pulse ox is 85, but she's a smoker.

09:32.514 --> 09:35.707
PO-2 is 70 on room air,
resps are high.

09:35.880 --> 09:39.540
No widened mediastinum.
Ruptured aorta is highly unlikely.

09:39.714 --> 09:41.736
Could be mild
cardiac contusion or MI.

09:41.913 --> 09:45.174
I'm thinking pulmonary embolus.
Resps are high, tacky, low PO-2.

09:45.346 --> 09:49.108
She's drunk at seven in the morning.
It's probably cardiomyopathy.

09:49.279 --> 09:51.404
- I want a VQ scan.
- You're grasping at straws.

09:51.578 --> 09:55.237
Give her thiamine, folate, multi-vits.
Rehydrate with D5 NS.

09:55.411 --> 09:58.400
Support her pressure with dopamine
and admit to Telemetry...

09:58.578 --> 10:01.509
...for serial EKGs and enzymes.

10:03.944 --> 10:06.966
Get her to Radiology
and get a VQ scan.

10:07.810 --> 10:11.299
Do Swift's orders
and scan her anyway.

10:12.877 --> 10:16.502
Hi, Caleb. I'm Dr. Ross.
This is Dr. Carter.

10:16.676 --> 10:21.266
- You have a fever.
- 101. No cough, no abdominal pain.

10:21.442 --> 10:23.840
- I feel okay.
- He's just finished a round of chemo.

10:24.009 --> 10:26.406
Look for a bacterial infection.

10:26.575 --> 10:31.098
- You been around any sick people?
- It's probably just the Hickman.

10:31.275 --> 10:33.173
- Catheter? Is it sore?
- Yeah.

10:33.342 --> 10:36.398
It's always sore.
Sarah just freaks out.

10:36.574 --> 10:39.369
- I'm scared, Caleb.
- Did you call your parents?

10:39.541 --> 10:43.267
Sarah's right. After chemo your
body doesn't want to fight infection.

10:43.440 --> 10:47.235
CBC plus differential,
blood cultures times three...

10:47.405 --> 10:50.133
...urine culture, throat swab,
chest film. What else?

10:50.306 --> 10:53.067
- I'll do an LP.
- I don't want a spinal tap!

10:53.240 --> 10:56.501
- I just had one.
- Why a tap, Carter?

10:56.671 --> 10:59.638
Irritability and/or lethargy
are early signs of meningitis.

10:59.806 --> 11:01.963
The deal is this, Caleb.

11:02.137 --> 11:04.865
You're not lethargic,
but you are irritable.

11:05.038 --> 11:09.265
That could either be meningitis
or just your personality.

11:09.437 --> 11:12.460
We're gonna wait
and take a look at some tests...

11:12.637 --> 11:16.932
...and if you're still a pain in the ass
we'll do the tap, okay?

11:17.103 --> 11:20.694
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics?
- Yep.

11:20.869 --> 11:26.302
Gentamicin 80 migs, oxacillin one
gram and piperacillin 1.5 grams IV.

11:26.469 --> 11:28.128
Find out who's on call for Oncology.

11:28.502 --> 11:29.763
Peter!

11:35.834 --> 11:38.027
I called you. You get my messages?

11:38.201 --> 11:40.690
Yeah. Sorry, I've been working a lot.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.629
And you really shouldn't
call me at home.

11:47.168 --> 11:50.190
- We need to talk.
- All right.

11:51.466 --> 11:54.364
Lunch? All right, we'll talk.

11:55.366 --> 11:58.093
- Yeah.
- Okay. See you then.

12:01.931 --> 12:05.489
- You paged me, doctor?
- Saddle embolus.

12:07.132 --> 12:09.528
You ordered pulmonary angiography?

12:09.698 --> 12:12.290
Before or after you scanned her?

12:12.464 --> 12:15.021
BP was falling,
increased respiratory rate.

12:15.197 --> 12:18.425
Rising PCO-2, falling PO-2 and pH.

12:18.598 --> 12:21.188
S1 -Q 3 on the EKG.

12:21.363 --> 12:23.522
Did you book an O. R?

12:24.296 --> 12:26.092
What are you waiting for?

12:26.263 --> 12:28.751
Go ahead, move her. Go, go!

12:30.963 --> 12:33.758
- Good work.
- Thanks.

12:33.929 --> 12:37.520
We got served today on your
preeclampsia. Malpractice.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.018
- Jodi O' Brian?
- Yeah.

12:40.195 --> 12:42.922
Wrongful death,
pain and suffering, the usual.

12:43.962 --> 12:47.825
- What? You didn't think they would?
- I wasn't sure.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.386
Come and see me later,
we'll talk it out.

13:24.057 --> 13:26.182
What medication are you taking,
Mr. Allison?

13:26.357 --> 13:30.448
DdC, Bactrim, AZT,
fluconazole and rifabutin.

13:30.623 --> 13:33.919
Let's start hydration
with D5 NS, 300cc's.

13:34.590 --> 13:37.147
- What've you got?
- End-stage AIDS patient.

13:37.323 --> 13:40.312
Multiple meds, temp 101, tacky.

13:40.490 --> 13:43.580
History of GI lymphoma,
PCP pneumonia, Kaposi's...

13:43.755 --> 13:47.312
...AIDS dementia, oral thrush
and cryptococcal meningitis.

13:47.489 --> 13:50.250
High pitched bowel sounds,
tenderness, distention...

13:50.421 --> 13:54.377
...hepatosplenomegaly, positive
guaiac, no recent stool or gas.

13:54.554 --> 13:58.042
Vomiting blood and bile.
Started a 300cc fluid challenge.

13:58.354 --> 14:01.808
Okay. Let's get a KUB,
lateral decubitus, chest films...

14:01.986 --> 14:05.248
...blood cultures including
mycobacterium, fungal, CMV...

14:05.420 --> 14:08.715
...CBC, Chem-24, urine
and let's get an NG tube down now.

14:08.886 --> 14:12.477
- He's all yours.
- Morphine 4, IV.

14:12.652 --> 14:15.742
We suspect a bowel obstruction
from enlarged lymph nodes...

14:15.918 --> 14:17.975
...due to recurrent lymphoma.

14:18.152 --> 14:20.710
This is Dr. Benton.
He's the surgical resident.

14:20.885 --> 14:23.783
- Is he gonna need surgery?
- Maybe.

14:23.951 --> 14:26.611
We'll try drugs and hydration first.

14:28.484 --> 14:32.917
Okay, let's get some Neupogen
to stimulate neutrophil growth.

14:33.084 --> 14:36.776
Let's try and get some of those
good white blood cells going again.

14:38.350 --> 14:40.441
I know what neutrophils are.

14:40.617 --> 14:44.173
- Do I have to stay in the hospital?
- It's too early to say.

14:44.349 --> 14:47.247
We have to see how you respond
to the antibiotics.

14:47.416 --> 14:52.075
- Let me know in a couple of hours.
- Dr. Carter will keep an eye on you.

14:54.015 --> 14:58.174
Last time I got a rash
from my antibiotics.

14:59.582 --> 15:03.013
- You need anything?
- You don't have to leave too?

15:03.180 --> 15:06.943
- He's trying to be nice.
- Shut up, Fat Sarah.

15:08.380 --> 15:12.937
I don't have to be anywhere. It's my
last day. I can be anywhere I want.

15:17.812 --> 15:19.937
Okay, see you later.

15:20.112 --> 15:22.168
I'm bored.

15:23.011 --> 15:26.535
Well, I could get you a VCR.
You can watch a video.

15:26.712 --> 15:29.871
I don't wanna watch TV.
I'm sick of TV.

15:33.145 --> 15:35.373
Last chance.

15:38.611 --> 15:41.042
Suit yourself.

15:45.643 --> 15:48.870
Temp's 102. BP's still 70 over 50.

15:52.476 --> 15:55.375
We're not seeing much progress,
Mr. Warren.

15:55.541 --> 15:58.803
Do you have power of attorney
to make decisions for Thomas?

15:58.975 --> 16:02.066
- No, his mother does.
- We should call her.

16:02.241 --> 16:04.639
I already have.

16:06.408 --> 16:10.840
- What do you want to do?
- We may have to treat it surgically.

16:11.007 --> 16:13.632
- A colostomy?
- Yes.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.829
We've had a lot of friends
go through this.

16:17.006 --> 16:20.461
How soon can his mother get here?

16:20.640 --> 16:22.571
What? Can't it wait?

16:24.306 --> 16:26.465
Not long, no.

16:29.371 --> 16:31.701
I'll call her again.

16:36.171 --> 16:39.660
- Thought you were a bridesmaid.
- On my way out.

16:39.838 --> 16:42.168
- An afternoon wedding?
- As if you didn't know.

16:42.338 --> 16:44.530
Got an unconscious geezer in Two...

16:44.704 --> 16:47.636
...four-martini lunch
with a bellyache in Five.

16:47.804 --> 16:49.530
Carter, I have a drunk in Five.

16:49.703 --> 16:53.362
Whatever happened to the practice
of pediatrics around here?

16:55.037 --> 16:59.695
I turned in my course evaluation,
it's in Dr. Hicks' box.

16:59.869 --> 17:03.925
Wilkins chose Orthopedics,
so the surgical sub-I is left open.

17:04.101 --> 17:06.396
- You want it or not?
- In the ER?

17:06.569 --> 17:09.227
- Yeah. I'm in a hurry. Yes or no?
- I got it?

17:09.401 --> 17:11.027
Yeah, I definitely want it.

17:11.202 --> 17:13.259
September 5, five a.m. Don't be late.

17:13.434 --> 17:15.127
Okay. Thank you!

17:22.367 --> 17:23.832
Excuse me.

17:25.266 --> 17:28.664
- Get drunk for me.
- Free champagne? Count on it!

17:28.834 --> 17:32.458
Rolando? What happened
to all the stuff in Dr. Hicks' box?

17:32.632 --> 17:35.928
My course evaluation that I turned in
this morning is gone!

17:36.098 --> 17:39.360
She cleaned out her box
a couple of minutes ago.

17:39.532 --> 17:42.928
- Have fun!
- You know we will, girl.

17:43.798 --> 17:45.787
Is anybody not going
to the wedding?

17:45.965 --> 17:49.260
Just us. The sick,
the lame, the uninvited.

17:49.431 --> 17:52.362
Oh, I'm a dead man.

17:54.231 --> 17:56.026
Here it is.

18:00.896 --> 18:04.259
- Do I need an attorney?
- Hospital will handle it.

18:05.229 --> 18:09.661
My wife's an attorney, she may want
someone to look at it independently.

18:09.829 --> 18:11.658
It's your money.

18:14.895 --> 18:16.225
Thanks.

18:17.228 --> 18:19.251
- Is that it?
- No.

18:19.428 --> 18:23.587
I've decided to sign off on
you as attending for next year.

18:24.627 --> 18:27.593
A show of appreciation
is customary.

18:33.127 --> 18:35.854
- I have to talk to my wife.
- Fair enough.

18:36.892 --> 18:39.358
I need to know by tomorrow.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.258
Thank you.

18:57.458 --> 18:59.855
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

19:00.857 --> 19:04.653
- She knew, Peter.
- Yeah, but...

19:07.123 --> 19:08.851
Sorry.

19:11.589 --> 19:13.112
I can't do this.

19:14.256 --> 19:18.914
- Do what?
- I like you, Peter, but I don't know.

19:21.289 --> 19:23.447
I think this is about your mother.

19:32.954 --> 19:35.284
We'd like to think that, huh?

19:49.286 --> 19:54.809
Chloe, I'm so late. Could you grab
a half-slip and some hose out of...

19:54.985 --> 19:58.473
Oh, gosh, I think they're
in the second drawer.

19:58.651 --> 20:02.981
Oh, Chloe! I asked you
to do the laundry.

20:03.151 --> 20:05.708
I don't even have a dry towel.

20:05.884 --> 20:07.645
Chloe?

20:07.818 --> 20:09.306
Chloe?

20:09.951 --> 20:11.347
Chloe!

20:14.349 --> 20:16.611
Of course. Perfect.

20:22.249 --> 20:23.771
Oh, my...

20:30.514 --> 20:34.311
Oh, yeah, it's okay. It's all right.

20:38.314 --> 20:40.473
- Yes?
- Dr. Hicks?

20:40.647 --> 20:44.602
- I'm John Carter, Dr. Benton's student.
- Come on in.

20:46.146 --> 20:49.112
I turned in my course evaluation
this morning...

20:49.280 --> 20:53.405
...and I was wondering
if I might make some revisions?

20:53.579 --> 20:55.341
Yes, I've read it.

20:55.512 --> 21:00.069
A sixteen. Sounds like
you had a disappointing experience.

21:01.678 --> 21:05.201
Would you like to hear
what he said about you?

21:05.944 --> 21:07.570
Sure.

21:13.677 --> 21:16.109
Carter, John Truman.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.470
"Exceptional student. Well-trained...

21:19.776 --> 21:24.333
...superior diagnostic skills.
Fast learner, dedicated, selfless.

21:24.509 --> 21:26.532
Excellent bedside manner
with patients.

21:26.709 --> 21:30.936
Far better at dealing with patients'
emotional needs than this instructor.

21:31.109 --> 21:34.302
Highly intelligent."
You wanna hear more?

21:36.675 --> 21:37.970
He concludes:

21:38.141 --> 21:42.073
"One of the finest students
I've had the opportunity to work with.

21:42.241 --> 21:43.831
Recommend High Honors."

21:44.008 --> 21:46.973
He gave me High Honors?

21:49.240 --> 21:52.330
I was upset that he didn't give me
the surgery sub-I.

21:52.506 --> 21:56.166
Did he tell you Wilkins dropped out
and you had the surgical sub-I?

21:56.340 --> 21:58.964
So you came up here
to get this back?

22:00.506 --> 22:02.767
This is what you thought
of Dr. Benton?

22:02.939 --> 22:08.565
No. He was hard on me,
and demanding, but I learned a lot.

22:11.105 --> 22:14.332
Why don't you take
another crack at this evaluation?

22:14.504 --> 22:16.164
Thank you.

22:16.338 --> 22:19.428
And, Carter,
I don't want it back at a forty.

22:19.603 --> 22:22.661
- Be honest. Fair.
- Right.

22:22.837 --> 22:26.064
- Thirty-eight okay?
- Yes, something like that.

22:31.469 --> 22:35.799
<i>With you ever so near me</i>

22:36.103 --> 22:40.398
<i>My baby, do go to sleep</i>

22:41.569 --> 22:46.398
<i>Bye, bye, my babykin, bye</i>

22:47.802 --> 22:52.495
<i>Why won 't you shut your eyes?</i>

22:52.801 --> 22:57.359
<i>Bye, bye, my babykin, bye</i>

22:59.467 --> 23:04.161
<i>Why won 't you shut your eyes?</i>

23:05.666 --> 23:09.792
Mrs. Allison? Hi. I'm Dr. Benton.

23:09.966 --> 23:13.897
We need your permission to perform
an emergency colostomy.

23:14.065 --> 23:16.156
The lymphoma?

23:16.332 --> 23:19.263
This could be a very
painful way for him to die.

23:20.265 --> 23:23.924
Can't be any worse than
what he's already been through.

23:24.098 --> 23:26.961
I won't put him through it.

23:33.229 --> 23:35.128
Okay.

23:35.297 --> 23:38.126
We'll try to make him
as comfortable as possible...

23:38.296 --> 23:42.819
...and maybe the current treatment
will resolve the obstruction.

23:45.228 --> 23:48.058
Four more morphine, IV.

23:59.794 --> 24:02.851
Marjorie decided against the surgery,
didn't she?

24:04.361 --> 24:08.087
I knew she would.
It's what Thomas would've wanted.

24:09.160 --> 24:13.956
That's why he chose her. He knew
I wouldn't have the strength.

24:17.160 --> 24:19.421
Can I take him home?

24:20.792 --> 24:22.418
I wouldn't.

24:22.592 --> 24:25.318
If he regains consciousness
it could be rough.

24:25.491 --> 24:27.956
Here we can manage his pain.

24:32.190 --> 24:35.315
You know, we've already
said our goodbyes.

24:40.756 --> 24:43.950
But I guess you're never
really ready.

24:49.356 --> 24:52.015
Back to the deathwatch.

25:14.154 --> 25:16.086
Mr. Hahn? I'm Dr. Ross.

25:16.254 --> 25:18.514
- Is Caleb okay?
- How's his temperature?

25:18.685 --> 25:21.742
- Down to 99.
- It's not the chemo.

25:21.919 --> 25:24.283
Caleb has a temperature
from an infection.

25:24.453 --> 25:29.510
The antibiotics are working, but
we'll keep him for a couple of hours.

25:29.685 --> 25:33.048
Mr. Hahn, there's a call
from a Dr. Bernstein.

25:33.217 --> 25:35.877
- You can take it out here.
- Our oncologist.

25:36.051 --> 25:39.709
I'll be back. Why don't you and your
daughter get something to eat?

25:39.884 --> 25:43.714
Bring it back for Caleb.
Cheeseburger and fries, am I right?

25:44.950 --> 25:46.609
Be right back.

25:49.049 --> 25:52.208
- Still bored?
- What do you think?

25:52.382 --> 25:55.815
Mortal Combat. I stole it from
a hemophiliac up in Pediatrics.

25:55.983 --> 25:59.846
- You stole it?
- Well, rented it. Cost me ten bucks.

26:00.015 --> 26:04.505
I'm pretty good, and it's more fun
than feeling sorry for yourself.

26:05.914 --> 26:08.745
Come on, you can be
anybody you want.

26:10.615 --> 26:12.477
- Johnny Cage.
- What?

26:12.647 --> 26:16.739
- I get to be Johnny Cage.
- Okay. Right.

26:16.914 --> 26:19.209
- You said you knew how to play.
- I do.

26:19.380 --> 26:22.812
- I know them more by their colors.
- Dime a match.

26:23.980 --> 26:27.139
- How much will that cost me?
- Depends on if you can really play.

26:27.312 --> 26:29.244
All right, you're on.

26:43.078 --> 26:44.066
Mark!

26:44.978 --> 26:49.307
Hi, everybody. Mark and Jennifer,
could you take the baby, please?

26:49.477 --> 26:53.340
Don't ask. The bottle's in the pouch,
and I just changed her.

26:53.510 --> 26:56.033
- Where's Chloe?
- Who knows?

26:56.210 --> 26:57.869
I gotta go.

27:01.642 --> 27:05.575
I'm sorry. Thanks.
Chloe stuck me with the baby.

27:05.741 --> 27:09.037
- How do I look?
- Like a big peach snow cone.

27:09.975 --> 27:12.203
Oh, oh, here she comes.

27:34.939 --> 27:36.996
Come on, girlfriend.

27:39.872 --> 27:42.464
Oh, Carol.

27:43.838 --> 27:46.702
- So?
- You look great.

27:46.871 --> 27:48.861
Oh, God, I'm really nervous.

27:49.037 --> 27:53.264
- Time to seat the bride's mother.
- I'm not going to cry.

27:55.337 --> 27:58.065
Now remember,
not too many petals at once.

27:58.238 --> 28:00.828
I know how to do it.

28:01.003 --> 28:04.367
- You all set, Carol?
- Yep. Uncle Michel, you're on.

28:08.636 --> 28:10.659
Well, Father, we're all set. Let's go.

28:10.836 --> 28:13.323
Yep. All we need now is the groom.

28:16.301 --> 28:18.029
How's Thomas doing?

28:18.202 --> 28:22.133
Temp's up to 103, BP's 65 over 50.

30:14.323 --> 30:17.721
Tag? What are you doing?

30:18.923 --> 30:20.683
It's beautiful here, isn't it?

30:21.822 --> 30:23.754
Yeah, it is.

30:23.922 --> 30:28.411
Tag, we've got a whole church full
of our friends and family waiting.

30:29.355 --> 30:31.218
Are you scared?

30:33.288 --> 30:35.015
A little.

30:35.187 --> 30:36.847
Me too.

30:42.620 --> 30:45.109
I was thinking
maybe you don't love me enough.

30:46.287 --> 30:48.081
Tag, I love you.

30:48.286 --> 30:49.945
Do you really?

30:52.653 --> 30:55.016
I was waiting in the sacristy...

30:55.219 --> 30:58.413
...and I was thinking that
you really don't love me.

30:58.586 --> 31:03.041
And I've known it all along
and I've just been kidding myself.

31:03.651 --> 31:06.708
I wouldn't be marrying you
if I didn't love you.

31:08.984 --> 31:14.245
I wake up every morning and thank
God for bringing you into my life.

31:15.617 --> 31:20.312
I wake up in the middle of the night
sometimes just to watch you sleep.

31:20.483 --> 31:22.915
When we're at the movies and...

31:23.083 --> 31:25.947
...your hand brushes against mine
I can hardly breathe.

31:30.449 --> 31:32.779
Do you love me like that, Carol?

31:41.447 --> 31:43.936
If you care at all about me...

31:44.115 --> 31:45.944
...please tell me the truth.

31:52.748 --> 31:54.110
No.

31:56.346 --> 31:57.642
I don't.

32:03.912 --> 32:06.470
But I do love you, Tag.

32:06.646 --> 32:08.577
And I wanna be with you.

32:18.277 --> 32:19.334
Thank you.

32:44.309 --> 32:45.865
After six.

32:48.907 --> 32:51.533
Should be " Dr. And
Mrs. Taglieri" by now.

32:51.708 --> 32:55.571
Connie, did anyone ever tell you
you're a truly evil person?

32:55.741 --> 32:58.571
- Somebody's waiting for you.
- I've got a patient.

32:58.741 --> 33:00.298
He's been waiting awhile.

33:06.073 --> 33:10.027
- Was it something I did?
- No, you were great.

33:10.206 --> 33:12.069
This is all me.

33:12.239 --> 33:15.102
- Maybe we can fix it.
- I don't think so.

33:15.271 --> 33:18.897
- We can try.
- Jake, look, I did something bad...

33:19.072 --> 33:21.536
...and I hurt your mother, okay?

33:22.871 --> 33:26.167
- What did you do?
- Come here. Sit down.

33:35.503 --> 33:39.367
I know that you think
that I'm a good guy...

33:39.536 --> 33:42.400
...but I'm not really. I...

33:43.969 --> 33:47.197
I don't know why I
hurt people sometimes.

33:51.035 --> 33:54.160
I did something with another woman
that I shouldn't have done.

33:54.335 --> 33:58.630
Your mother found out and now she
doesn't want me to come around.

33:59.701 --> 34:01.359
Oh.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.156
You and I can't hang out.

34:09.266 --> 34:12.494
I never meant to hurt you.

34:13.833 --> 34:16.731
The one with the nice clothes
and all the hair?

34:23.697 --> 34:25.891
The one with all the hair.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.391
I'm sorry, buddy.

34:34.197 --> 34:38.562
I gotta go. My mom'd be mad
if she knew I was here.

34:47.730 --> 34:52.492
Show me how you rip the guy's
head off and set him on fire.

34:52.663 --> 34:55.150
- Up, right, kick, kick, down, block.
- Wait. Up, up...

34:57.062 --> 34:59.254
Up, right, down, down, kick.

35:00.328 --> 35:02.555
Die, you bastard. Yes!

35:02.728 --> 35:06.785
Triple power move and a fatality.

35:07.861 --> 35:10.849
You're pretty rough on your sister.

35:16.360 --> 35:18.986
You've got A.L.L., right?

35:20.326 --> 35:23.292
My brother, Bobby had leukemia.

35:23.459 --> 35:24.448
Yeah?

35:26.159 --> 35:28.522
He used to pick on me all the time.

35:29.659 --> 35:34.318
Come up and hit me when I wasn't
expecting it, for no reason.

35:37.291 --> 35:38.723
Come on.

35:38.891 --> 35:41.823
He hated my mom for babying him.

35:41.990 --> 35:44.320
He just wanted to be a regular kid.

35:45.857 --> 35:47.789
So he took it out on me.

35:48.889 --> 35:53.185
He was just pretending that he could
still do everything he used to.

35:53.357 --> 35:56.254
But, you know...

35:58.090 --> 36:01.022
...he couldn't. Your turn.

36:04.521 --> 36:06.578
Did he make it?

36:06.755 --> 36:09.380
No, he died.

36:11.288 --> 36:14.254
But he had AML,
which is a lot harder to beat.

36:16.053 --> 36:19.383
It was a long time ago.
Medicines are a lot better now.

36:21.154 --> 36:23.675
And the kids are a lot tougher.

36:51.150 --> 36:54.344
- Where's Carol?
- Talking to her mother.

36:54.517 --> 36:57.949
- How is she?
- We took her shoelaces and belt.

36:58.117 --> 37:02.015
- Somebody ought to shoot him.
- Amen.

37:06.516 --> 37:10.208
- What'll they do with the food?
- Give it to a shelter or something.

37:10.382 --> 37:13.780
Alkies can barely keep down
a peanut butter sandwich.

37:13.948 --> 37:16.345
How're they gonna hold on
to Lobster Newburg?

37:16.514 --> 37:19.844
- They got lobster?
- Big ones. Size of your head.

37:20.648 --> 37:23.670
- You guys are gonna eat?
- Only a couple of plates' worth.

37:23.847 --> 37:27.075
- Mommy, I'm hungry.
- Come on, Rach.

37:27.247 --> 37:29.837
- Mark...
- She's hungry.

37:31.780 --> 37:33.837
Anybody want a drink?

37:34.013 --> 37:36.410
- Gin and tonic.
- Chivas straight up.

38:06.843 --> 38:08.469
You in one piece?

38:09.376 --> 38:11.365
Yeah, never been better.

38:21.909 --> 38:25.102
So I thought I was having a bad day.

38:25.674 --> 38:27.572
What's that?

38:27.741 --> 38:31.832
They went ahead with the reception.
You know my family.

38:32.007 --> 38:35.235
What's a little humiliation when
there's free food and drink?

38:44.572 --> 38:46.936
What's wrong with me?

38:49.440 --> 38:52.234
Why can't I fall in love
with a nice guy?

38:53.272 --> 38:57.203
Someone who loves me, who wants to
be with me, is honest and decent.

39:00.571 --> 39:03.264
- And boring.
- God, he was dull.

39:10.936 --> 39:13.993
All that talk about
fly-fishing and bowling.

39:14.170 --> 39:16.465
And playing football in college.

39:16.636 --> 39:19.034
- Bowling?
- Yeah.

39:33.201 --> 39:35.326
I just want to be happ y.

39:35.501 --> 39:39.432
- And I'm so afraid I never will be.
- You will.

39:49.932 --> 39:52.023
You will.

40:13.831 --> 40:15.558
Dr. Benton?

40:17.663 --> 40:21.652
I just want to say
thank you for everything.

40:21.830 --> 40:23.590
I learned a lot.

40:27.330 --> 40:30.227
- Have a good summer.
- You too.

40:35.762 --> 40:39.318
- You're gonna make a good doctor.
- Thanks.

41:04.758 --> 41:06.384
Carol!

41:09.592 --> 41:11.147
Carol?

41:16.758 --> 41:20.280
Speech! Speech!

41:20.457 --> 41:23.321
- Come on. Speech!
- Oh, please.

41:32.955 --> 41:34.216
Okay.

41:38.588 --> 41:40.986
I'm sure all this'll hit me tomorrow.

41:41.188 --> 41:43.518
Wait till you get the bar bill.

41:43.722 --> 41:45.312
No, that's going to Tag.

41:48.921 --> 41:51.216
I don't know what to say.

41:51.454 --> 41:54.147
I don't know what the future holds.

41:55.454 --> 41:58.681
I guess I'm just lucky to be alive...

41:58.853 --> 42:01.978
...and have so many good friends
who care for me.

42:04.485 --> 42:09.282
It's been a wonderful year
because of all of you.

42:33.816 --> 42:35.646
May I have a dance?

42:37.116 --> 42:40.048
- You bet.
- Music! We need music!

44:21.272 --> 44:23.500
And I need your I.D. Badge.

44:26.339 --> 44:29.736
- Dr. Carter?
- Hey, Sarah. I thought you guys left.

44:32.038 --> 44:34.436
What you did for my brother today...

44:34.605 --> 44:38.366
I hope that just once in my life...

44:38.537 --> 44:43.663
...I can make a difference like that
in someone else's life.

44:45.736 --> 44:48.998
- Thanks.
- No, Sarah, thank you.

45:01.069 --> 45:04.592
- What's this?
- Your deposit. Lab coat.

45:04.769 --> 45:07.098
Hey, don't be a stranger.
Come by and see us.

45:07.268 --> 45:10.597
No, I'm coming back in the fall.

45:10.768 --> 45:13.029
All right, I'll see you then.

45:13.668 --> 45:16.293
- What've we got?
- Fifteen-year-old GSW to the head.

45:16.467 --> 45:21.421
Tried to hold up a 7-Eleven. Ten
liters O-2. BP's 90 over 60, pulse 120.

45:21.600 --> 45:24.032
We started two large bore IVs...
