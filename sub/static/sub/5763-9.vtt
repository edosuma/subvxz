00:04.600 --> 00:05.334
No!

00:05.701 --> 00:07.933
I want you to remember me this way, please.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.566
No. not you.

00:09.633 --> 00:11.067
I will always love you, melinda.

00:11.134 --> 00:13.100
Oh, please not you.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.633
I am so empty without you.

00:15.700 --> 00:17.733
- I'm not going anywhere. - No, you have to cross over.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.000
I don't want to.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.800
Jim, no!

00:26.067 --> 00:27.000
You're back.

00:27.067 --> 00:28.434
Do I know you?

00:28.501 --> 00:30.633
Look, I see the same guy that you see.

00:30.700 --> 00:33.167
Different hair, nose, eyes. It's not jim.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.654
I just know what I see when I look in those eyes,

00:35.654 --> 00:37.267
And jim is in there somewhere.

00:37.334 --> 00:38.267
He just has to be.

00:38.334 --> 00:39.867
Do you believe in the afterlife?

00:40.149 --> 00:43.211
Wait, you're not gonna tell me you think I'm your husband reincarnated,

00:43.211 --> 00:45.967
Because you're the only sane person I've met since I woke up.

00:46.034 --> 00:48.467
It's not much, but maybe you could help me finish my garage.

00:48.533 --> 00:50.290
And you could live there while you do the work,

00:50.290 --> 00:51.933
Just until you figure out your next move.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.134
Will you tell me what is going on between us?

00:54.200 --> 00:55.933
Do you know how lucky you are?

00:56.000 --> 00:59.833
You are gonna get a second shot at your one true love.

01:46.666 --> 01:48.167
Oh! Oh. Hey. You're up early.

01:48.234 --> 01:50.900
Hey, Sam. Yeah, just... you know.

01:50.967 --> 01:52.666
Trying to be good.

01:52.733 --> 01:55.300
Yeah, me, too. Get a workout in.

01:55.367 --> 01:57.100
So...

01:57.167 --> 01:58.134
You want to, uh...

01:58.200 --> 02:00.034
- Together? - Ooh, I don't know.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.300
- No, that's stupid of me. - I'm sorry. what?

02:02.367 --> 02:04.596
This is probably a time when, you know, you want to be alone.

02:04.596 --> 02:06.267
You know, after what you've been through...

02:06.334 --> 02:07.267
No, it's not that.

02:07.334 --> 02:09.267
- Get your stuff together. - Right.

02:09.334 --> 02:11.234
Something you probably did with your husband, huh? in the morning?

02:11.300 --> 02:12.234
I don't want to get in your way.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.067
No. not at all. um...

02:15.134 --> 02:17.900
He worked a lot of weird hours, and liked to sleep in a lot.

02:17.967 --> 02:20.267
You're really not in my way at all.

02:20.334 --> 02:22.533
I should...well...

02:22.600 --> 02:25.566
Ah, nice work, Sam. um...

02:25.633 --> 02:27.067
Have a good morning.

02:27.134 --> 02:28.800
I'll run that way.

02:28.867 --> 02:30.533
I'll go this way.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.700
-See ya.  - See ya.

02:38.933 --> 02:42.112
Why couldn't I just say "your legs are longer than mine,

02:42.112 --> 02:44.367
"and I might not be able to keep up."

02:44.434 --> 02:45.666
What is so hard with saying that?

02:45.733 --> 02:47.939
Well, it's probably better than saying, "hey,

02:47.939 --> 02:51.375
You're the love of my life in a new body, "and every time I see you,

02:51.375 --> 02:52.401
My knees go weak."

02:52.467 --> 02:54.700
Ugh. my knees, my legs.

02:54.767 --> 02:58.267
I fumble with words, it's like my voice gets shaky.

02:58.334 --> 02:59.700
I'm a total dork... whoa!

03:03.167 --> 03:04.434
Hey, Sam.

03:05.666 --> 03:06.933
Hey. How you doin', Sam?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.501
Hey, Delia. Hey look...

03:08.600 --> 03:11.833
I've had this stuff in my truck for a couple of days... unh!

03:11.900 --> 03:14.557
And I've been meaning to give it to you, but every time I see you, I just.

03:14.733 --> 03:16.300
Forget.

03:16.367 --> 03:19.184
It's not like I don't forget everything else I've done in my life, I mean.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.900
How to read a blueprint I made, the name of my dog.

03:20.967 --> 03:22.200
You have a dog?

03:22.267 --> 03:25.000
No. but, I mean, that's what I think about when I wake up, you know?

03:25.067 --> 03:27.867
Anyhow, this is all yours to keep, or sell, or toss.

03:27.933 --> 03:29.401
Wow, you've got some nice things in here.

03:29.467 --> 03:30.566
Where did you get them?

03:30.633 --> 03:33.800
Well, I got a job doing some demo on a big house off of route 18.

03:33.867 --> 03:36.067
- They're getting rid of all the hardware  - Ooh!

03:42.300 --> 03:44.401
Hey, do you have a first aid kit I can...

03:44.467 --> 03:46.367
It's ok. it's just a cut.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.034
Here. here you go.

03:50.833 --> 03:52.401
You look a little pale.

03:52.467 --> 03:55.367
You have got to stop skipping breakfast.

03:55.434 --> 03:56.733
It's, you know, low blood sugar.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.800
Yeah. yeah. um, you said that there was more stuff?

03:59.867 --> 04:01.501
Yeah, in my truck, but...

04:01.566 --> 04:03.434
There's also tons more back at the site.

04:03.501 --> 04:04.566
Can I go look at it?

04:04.633 --> 04:05.733
Yeah, I was going there right now.

04:14.900 --> 04:17.600
Yeah, we started the job from the back of the house.

04:17.666 --> 04:20.233
I don't know if the owner wants to gut it or tear it down, but uh...

04:20.300 --> 04:22.501
I don't think you're gonna find too much high-end stuff here.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.600
Is there water around here anywhere?

04:24.666 --> 04:25.900
Water? why?

04:25.967 --> 04:28.467
Well, the tiles. I just was...

04:28.533 --> 04:30.367
I don't know. is there a fountain or a pool?

04:30.434 --> 04:31.434
There's a well right there.

04:31.501 --> 04:33.401
Is that what you were looking for?

04:46.267 --> 04:47.600
Why not, huh?

04:47.666 --> 04:49.700
It is a wishing well.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.134
Careful what you wish for.

05:31.933 --> 05:33.733
Are you sure this little girl is...

05:34.100 --> 05:35.500
- What do you call it?  - Attached to him?

05:35.567 --> 05:36.500
- Yeah.  - No.

05:36.567 --> 05:39.184
But as soon as Sam made his wish, she was right out of the well,

05:39.184 --> 05:40.534
Standing next to him, warning.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.167
Warning you or him?

05:42.233 --> 05:44.100
Who knows? maybe anybody who comes by the well.

05:44.167 --> 05:46.067
But she was definitely focused on him.

05:46.133 --> 05:48.133
Well, do you know what he wished?

05:48.200 --> 05:50.033
You got me.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.567
It had to be to get his memory back.

05:51.634 --> 05:53.434
And if so, what's the problem?

05:53.500 --> 05:54.966
We all know it's jim's spirit.

05:55.033 --> 05:57.900
You know it. even I know .

05:57.966 --> 06:00.966
What? what's that look for?

06:01.033 --> 06:02.467
Believing me.

06:03.467 --> 06:05.167
So, what are you going to do?

06:05.233 --> 06:08.467
Stop worrying about myself and the things I can't control...

06:08.534 --> 06:10.667
Help a dead little girl whose spirit is stuck down a well.

06:10.734 --> 06:12.434
Do you know if she ever lived in the house?

06:12.500 --> 06:13.567
The last owner was a widow.

06:13.634 --> 06:14.933
She had children, but no daughters.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.866
The place is, like, 100 years old.

06:16.933 --> 06:18.866
So, you're searching for what?

06:18.933 --> 06:21.734
A missing or dead child over the last century?

06:21.801 --> 06:22.242
Basically.

06:22.242 --> 06:24.688
Or I wait until she appears again and then try to

06:24.688 --> 06:27.334
Figure out if her warning was a threat or a promise.

06:39.767 --> 06:40.801
Look at this.

06:40.866 --> 06:42.400
It's still good. why are they tossing it?

06:42.467 --> 06:44.567
Contractor wants all new, you know?

06:54.967 --> 06:55.734
Man, I think I just lost an eardrum.

06:55.801 --> 06:57.434
You heard that?

06:57.500 --> 06:58.734
Yeah, it was Bob's truck.

06:58.801 --> 07:00.033
But twice?

07:00.100 --> 07:01.966
I don't think so.

07:04.267 --> 07:05.866
- Help me with this.  - Yeah.

07:10.033 --> 07:11.966
Sam, you ok? yeah.

07:39.300 --> 07:40.801
It's Melinda.

07:42.033 --> 07:44.267
Hang on a second.

07:45.334 --> 07:46.300
You just got in. How did you get...

07:46.367 --> 07:48.933
Uh, naked? um, sorry.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.434
Let me turn down the radio.

07:51.900 --> 07:54.067
Sorry. I had the radio on a little loud.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.966
Didn't you hear me? no. um...

07:58.033 --> 07:59.100
Hang on a second.

08:00.866 --> 08:03.067
So, uh, hey. what's up?

08:04.534 --> 08:06.434
What happened? did you hurt yourself?

08:09.367 --> 08:11.900
Well, not that I know of.

08:11.966 --> 08:15.001
And nothing that my doctor here or the one back home knows about, either.

08:16.066 --> 08:17.067
What do you mean?

08:18.400 --> 08:21.067
I thought it had something to do with the car accident.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.100
But that turns out to be a straight up head injury.

08:23.167 --> 08:25.767
I mean, sure. It could cause muscle trauma.

08:25.833 --> 08:26.833
Why am I feeling it now?

08:26.900 --> 08:28.534
When did it start?

08:28.600 --> 08:30.600
Well, it's weird.

08:30.667 --> 08:33.866
The first time I felt it, I heard a car backfire.

08:33.933 --> 08:35.634
It was like a rifle shot.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.900
I heard it twice, but it only happened once.

08:39.966 --> 08:41.767
I'm sure I just imagined it, but...

08:41.832 --> 08:44.933
Well, don't brush it off. I mean, it could be a memory.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.267
You know? one that you want to forget,

08:46.334 --> 08:47.933
But it could lead to others.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.100
Well, I hope so. I mean,

08:49.167 --> 08:50.434
I'm going through all these boxes,

08:50.500 --> 08:51.900
All my old stuff.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.933
Just trying to jog something loose.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.100
And?

08:56.534 --> 08:58.634
I don't know. I listen to cds,

08:58.701 --> 09:00.734
I see pictures of people I'm supposed to have known, you know?

09:00.801 --> 09:02.534
I have a cell phone here. what do I do?

09:02.600 --> 09:05.067
I call these people and say, "hey. do you remember me?"

09:05.133 --> 09:06.400
'cause I don't.

09:06.467 --> 09:07.933
You said that it happened at work.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.300
Were you near the well?

09:09.367 --> 09:10.734
Nah, I was in and out of the house, you know.

09:10.801 --> 09:11.767
Coming and going past the well.

09:11.833 --> 09:13.833
And has anything weird happened there?

09:13.900 --> 09:15.300
To you or anyone?

09:15.367 --> 09:17.300
No. not that I can think of. why?

09:17.367 --> 09:18.833
What about the owners? I mean,

09:18.900 --> 09:20.701
Have you talked to anyone who lived in the house?

09:20.767 --> 09:23.100
I'm just working for the contractor.

09:23.167 --> 09:26.467
What are you getting at? why are you so curious about the well?

09:26.534 --> 09:28.767
I...it's my business.

09:28.833 --> 09:30.300
In a way. you know?

09:30.367 --> 09:31.900
Antiques, wells...

09:31.966 --> 09:33.467
I mean, there's actually a market for that kind of thing,

09:33.534 --> 09:35.100
Believe it or not.

09:39.767 --> 09:40.866
I should go.

09:42.434 --> 09:44.900
All right.

09:44.966 --> 09:46.300
Sorry about being naked.

09:49.434 --> 09:52.500
Who are you? what do you want?

09:52.567 --> 09:54.900
Look, talk to me, but just leave him alone.

10:10.033 --> 10:13.933
I made your, uh, chicken with the tahini sauce.

10:14.000 --> 10:14.966
And a good salad.

10:15.033 --> 10:16.634
good, you're eating.

10:16.701 --> 10:18.133
Yeah.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.500
That's me. I am eating.

10:22.033 --> 10:24.667
Ugh. something that looks inedible

10:24.734 --> 10:26.067
And totally raw.

10:26.133 --> 10:28.600
Well, what'd you cook the chicken on?

10:28.667 --> 10:31.334
- On? a pan.  - I mean what temperature?

10:31.400 --> 10:32.600
I told you for an hour at...

10:32.667 --> 10:33.701
Yeah, I did an hour.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.000
In the oven?

10:36.067 --> 10:38.701
In the oven? you...you said on for an hour.

10:38.767 --> 10:40.000
No. no, no, no.

10:40.067 --> 10:41.534
That was the pan searing.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.433
I said inside the oven at 425.

10:46.634 --> 10:48.300
Well, I didn't hear that part.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.933
Delia, I miss him so much.

10:56.334 --> 10:57.833
And you're right. I mean,

10:57.900 --> 10:58.966
He's keeping his distance

10:59.033 --> 11:00.267
Because he thinks I'm grieving.

11:00.334 --> 11:01.933
And the truth is...

11:02.000 --> 11:04.801
I am.

11:04.866 --> 11:07.801
I just miss him.

11:07.866 --> 11:10.000
You know, and today...

11:10.067 --> 11:12.833
Today he remembered something from his life...

11:12.900 --> 11:15.100
I mean Jim's. or at least I think he did.

11:15.167 --> 11:16.600
Well, that's great, honey.

11:16.667 --> 11:19.100
No, it's not. because...

11:19.167 --> 11:21.467
He remembered being shot.

11:21.534 --> 11:22.734
You know? and I-I think...

11:22.801 --> 11:24.833
I think the ghost is responsible for that

11:24.900 --> 11:25.866
If that's what he wished for.

11:25.933 --> 11:27.500
I'm...I'm so sorry.

11:27.567 --> 11:29.634
It just scares me.

11:29.701 --> 11:32.467
You know, what he might have to go through

11:32.534 --> 11:36.167
To come back to me. and...

11:36.233 --> 11:37.400
What if he doesn't want to?

11:39.200 --> 11:41.434
He already came back to you.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.600
I want you to remember that.

11:44.866 --> 11:47.634
Jim did all of this for you.

11:52.100 --> 11:54.567
Could you just...

11:54.634 --> 11:58.233
Stay on the phone with me for, like, 5 more minutes?

11:58.300 --> 12:00.534
Then I promise we'll both go to sleep.

12:00.600 --> 12:05.600
Yeah, sure.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.767
We can talk all night if you want to.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.000
I warned you.

12:49.067 --> 12:51.067
Stay away from the well.

12:51.133 --> 12:54.600
My arms and legs.

12:54.667 --> 12:56.100
Did someone do that to you?

12:56.167 --> 12:58.500
Terrible things will happen if you don't stay away.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.600
So what is it about explicitly being told to stay away

13:09.667 --> 13:11.834
That inspires you to come running to this house?

13:11.901 --> 13:13.700
I can't exactly search for clues

13:13.767 --> 13:16.967
With everyone working here, especially Sam.

13:17.033 --> 13:18.100
How was she when you saw her before?

13:18.166 --> 13:19.400
One piece or chopped liver?

13:19.467 --> 13:20.600
She was all in one piece.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.467
Must have happened after she died.

13:22.534 --> 13:24.200
Yeah, for transport.

13:24.267 --> 13:26.066
For some killers, dismemberment's a fetish,

13:26.133 --> 13:27.800
But for most it's a matter of convenience.

13:27.867 --> 13:30.033
I mean, how else are you gonna stuff the body in the trunk?

13:30.100 --> 13:32.700
Your encyclopedic knowledge of the depraved

13:32.767 --> 13:34.767
Is awe-inspiring.

13:34.834 --> 13:37.166
And if you've got a crowbar in that snazzy little tote,

13:37.233 --> 13:38.700
I'll be impressed.

13:38.767 --> 13:39.934
They didn't even lock it.

13:40.001 --> 13:41.066
Come in.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.001
Look at all these newspapers.

13:45.066 --> 13:46.734
Oh, my god.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.500
Welcome to the nest of the giant pack rat.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.400
Who lived here?

13:52.467 --> 13:53.967
A widow in her sixties.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.166
Heart attack.

13:57.066 --> 13:58.800
You know they linked hoarding to perfectionism?

13:58.867 --> 14:00.567
It's ironic, isn't it? because people who have it

14:00.634 --> 14:01.634
End up living like this.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.133
Yeah. not the most inviting place

14:04.200 --> 14:05.667
For a kid to visit.

14:05.734 --> 14:07.467
Do you think that she was drawn to the property

14:07.534 --> 14:09.333
Because of the well?

14:09.400 --> 14:11.033
Maybe it's just where she wound up.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.967
Nearest dispose-all where the killer could dump her body.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.300
Wait.

14:17.367 --> 14:18.667
Swing that back over there.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.267
What is that?

14:25.834 --> 14:28.233
Forget transport. I'm thinking fetish.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.734
How long has this house been empty?

14:32.934 --> 14:34.600
I don't know.

14:34.667 --> 14:36.133
The widow died a few months ago.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.950
And has it always been empty,

14:37.950 --> 14:39.700
or could someone else be living here.

14:39.767 --> 14:42.433
I no longer care if the neighbors call the cops.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.634
What is this?

14:49.934 --> 14:51.934
They're wishes.

14:52.001 --> 14:53.200
A wish for new toys,

14:53.267 --> 14:55.467
A million dollars.

14:55.534 --> 14:59.001
A teacup terrier who won't bite.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.567
It's like they were all written by children.

15:00.634 --> 15:03.033
Santa would have been a better bet.

15:03.100 --> 15:04.600
Wait, look at this one.

15:04.667 --> 15:07.300
This looks like adult handwriting.

15:07.367 --> 15:09.300
"I wish he could know she was here."

15:16.867 --> 15:18.066
I gotta say,

15:18.133 --> 15:20.934
It's awfully nice of someone who chops up a little girl

15:21.001 --> 15:22.901
To leave a note. for who?

15:22.967 --> 15:25.500
The girl's father? wishing he'd learn the truth?

15:25.567 --> 15:27.667
So nice of that old lady pack rat to save it.

15:27.734 --> 15:29.600
Um, she saved everything.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.534
Meaning she had no idea there was a little girl down the well?

15:31.600 --> 15:33.934
Meaning we don't know if there's a little girl in the well.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.233
I'm not going down that well.

15:37.300 --> 15:38.767
I don't care if you have flippers and a mask in that bag,

15:38.834 --> 15:40.600
- I'm not going.  - Ok, fine.

15:40.667 --> 15:41.800
I just think she's haunting it

15:41.867 --> 15:43.901
'cause it has something to do with her death.

15:43.967 --> 15:45.100
Good morning.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.400
- Eli, right?  - Yeah. Sam, hey.

15:47.467 --> 15:49.333
- We were just... - We went to this, um...

15:53.467 --> 15:54.500
It's early, right?

15:54.567 --> 15:56.667
Yeah. it's morning.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
I'm...I'm just gonna read the sports.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.500
Maybe I'll remember what team I like.

16:03.333 --> 16:05.634
Oh, hey. Melinda?

16:05.900 --> 16:07.300
Remember you were asking me about the history of that well?

16:07.366 --> 16:08.400
You had a buyer or something?

16:08.467 --> 16:09.467
Yeah, right.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.834
Yeah. well, I asked around. it turns out

16:10.900 --> 16:13.034
That the contractors were hired by the old lady's son.

16:13.101 --> 16:14.433
He pretty much owns it now.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.700
He's staying at a place called the, um...

16:16.767 --> 16:19.000
Grandview Court. his last name's Ackerman.

16:19.067 --> 16:21.567
- Travis Ackerman.  - Great. thanks.

16:21.633 --> 16:24.467
- Sure. - Can I ask you a...

16:24.533 --> 16:25.667
A strange question?

16:27.700 --> 16:29.700
What did you wish for?

16:29.767 --> 16:31.633
At the well?

16:31.700 --> 16:33.834
I can't tell you that.

16:33.900 --> 16:36.134
Might not come true.

16:38.067 --> 16:40.633
I cannot wait for this ghost to cross over as soon as possible.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.266
Let's go see that pack rat's son.

16:42.333 --> 16:43.600
Travis Ackerman.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.400
- Let me do it. - Are you sure?

16:45.467 --> 16:47.201
Yeah no problem.

16:49.134 --> 16:51.467
You said you called because you have a buyer

16:51.533 --> 16:52.834
For some of the items at the house?

16:52.900 --> 16:55.934
I thought that we got anything of value out of there.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.967
I was visiting a friend up there,

16:58.034 --> 16:59.967
And I saw these dolls.

17:00.034 --> 17:01.101
Dolls?

17:01.167 --> 17:03.167
Doll pieces.

17:03.266 --> 17:04.201
That's weird.

17:04.266 --> 17:05.233
Do you know what I'm talking about?

17:05.300 --> 17:06.900
There was a... a pile of them.

17:06.967 --> 17:09.800
You know? arms and legs.

17:09.867 --> 17:12.400
They were next to a box of notes,

17:12.467 --> 17:17.767
Or, um... wishes. Actually. I think.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.934
You know what? I...I do know what you're talking about.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.599
I found a bunch of broken dolls.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.433
They were yanked apart.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.400
Um, somebody left them with a note

17:26.467 --> 17:28.600
- At the foot of the well. - The well?

17:28.667 --> 17:30.266
Yeah, there's this old well on our property.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.600
It's a wishing well, actually.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.533
Neighborhood kids knew about it.

17:33.600 --> 17:34.867
I was already 15 when

17:34.867 --> 17:36.134
we moved into that old place,

17:36.201 --> 17:39.067
But, uh, every once in a while,I would see them out there.

17:39.134 --> 17:42.700
Of course,they would run the minute anyone from the house came out.

17:42.767 --> 17:44.734
- Why's that? - You know, uh,

17:44.800 --> 17:47.633
Old, creaky place near the new subdivision.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.533
We were instantly the spooky house.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.333
I was going through a bit of a rough patch at the time.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.467
And I kinda figured if I could help

17:56.533 --> 17:58.900
Grant some little girl's wish, why not?

17:58.967 --> 18:01.101
So I, uh, I took the broken parts...

18:01.167 --> 18:04.366
Which, big surprise, it sounds like my mother saved,

18:04.433 --> 18:07.567
And I, uh, I left a new doll.

18:07.633 --> 18:08.900
And the next day, it was gone.

18:08.967 --> 18:11.067
Did you have any idea who the girl was?

18:11.134 --> 18:12.967
No. I only ever saw her from a distance.

18:13.034 --> 18:14.333
She was alone.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.366
No more than 10, long dark hair.

18:19.101 --> 18:22.467
You know, the truth is I learned to keep my distance from that well.

18:22.533 --> 18:26.000
I kinda wish everyone would.

18:28.167 --> 18:29.167
Why is that?

18:32.101 --> 18:33.034
You'll think I'm nuts.

18:33.101 --> 18:35.067
It's unlikely.

18:35.134 --> 18:36.333
I can usually tell.

18:38.167 --> 18:40.067
All right. um...

18:40.134 --> 18:42.233
When I was 18, i...

18:42.300 --> 18:45.000
I got a full scholarship to an out-of-state school.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.716
And then I found out that

18:46.716 --> 18:48.366
my girlfriend was pregnant.

18:48.433 --> 18:50.700
I didn't say it was all your fault...

18:50.767 --> 18:52.567
You know, I saw my future slipping away.

18:52.633 --> 18:55.967
I would be one more thing that my mom could hang onto.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.000
You know, me, Allison,

18:58.000 --> 18:59.967
and a baby all stuck in that house.

19:00.034 --> 19:02.900
- And... - We will be happy.

19:02.967 --> 19:05.201
I wished.

19:05.266 --> 19:07.734
With Allison right there, I wished...

19:07.800 --> 19:08.934
That she weren't pregnant.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.400
I said I'd give anything.

19:13.467 --> 19:15.633
Allison's car was parked out front,

19:15.700 --> 19:18.400
Right along the side of the road.

19:18.467 --> 19:20.734
And these, uh, these racers... these cyclists

19:20.800 --> 19:22.834
Came flying down the hill.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.500
And she got hit.

19:31.101 --> 19:33.767
She lost the baby, and I went away to school

19:33.834 --> 19:35.101
And she never spoke to me again.

19:36.467 --> 19:39.233
So...

19:39.300 --> 19:41.767
Wish granted.

19:41.834 --> 19:45.366
But I'm sure that you don't believe in

19:45.433 --> 19:46.934
All of that stuff anyway.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.433
You'd be surprised what I believe.

19:49.834 --> 19:52.667
Let me tell you what a friend of mine saw down your well.

19:54.433 --> 19:57.067
So just like that the son agrees to drain the well?

19:57.134 --> 19:58.233
It was an easy sell.

19:58.300 --> 19:59.600
The ghost got the guy halfway believing

19:59.667 --> 20:01.800
She was real just by granting his wish.

20:01.867 --> 20:02.917
He feels if she's down there,

20:02.917 --> 20:03.967
the family deserves to know.

20:04.034 --> 20:05.167
Well, that's cooperative.

20:05.233 --> 20:07.633
Not what you'd expect from a brutal killer.

20:07.700 --> 20:08.867
I didn't get that from this guy.

20:08.934 --> 20:10.201
What about his mother?

20:10.266 --> 20:11.333
She seemed like a nice lady

20:11.400 --> 20:13.167
With an anxiety disorder.

20:13.233 --> 20:14.667
What? what am I missing?

20:14.734 --> 20:16.433
Well, I'm just thinking about the wish

20:16.500 --> 20:17.600
That Travis had granted.

20:17.667 --> 20:20.067
I mean, it certainly proves the ghost's point.

20:20.134 --> 20:21.233
Be careful what you wish for.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.467
Yeah, but what caused the little girl's death?

20:22.533 --> 20:24.067
Because she keeps warning us against wishes

20:24.134 --> 20:26.900
So it obviously has to be something that she wished for.

20:26.967 --> 20:28.034
That ought to be easy to figure out.

20:28.101 --> 20:29.366
A little girl who wished for something.

20:29.433 --> 20:30.867
Yeah, but maybe we have more than that.

20:30.934 --> 20:32.867
I mean, now we know when she lived, right?

20:32.934 --> 20:36.650
So what if she's the girl that Travis Ackerman saw leaving doll parts?

20:36.650 --> 20:38.000
The severed doll parts.

20:38.067 --> 20:39.000
It's got to be her.

20:39.067 --> 20:41.300
Yeah, but when did she go missing?

20:41.366 --> 20:43.201
Well, Travis said he was 15 when he moved in.

20:43.266 --> 20:45.500
Yeah, and he left for school when he was 18.

20:45.567 --> 20:47.201
And he's late 20s now. I mean, how many girls

20:47.266 --> 20:50.233
Could go deceased or missing in Grandview in a 3-year span?

20:52.034 --> 20:55.567
Gretchen Dennis. that's her.

20:55.633 --> 20:58.067
Missing since 1996.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.300
You were right. and, uh...

21:19.366 --> 21:21.333
It's pretty awful.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.500
I'm sorry.

21:22.567 --> 21:23.767
Thanks for doing this.

21:23.834 --> 21:26.767
Yeah. yeah, um...

21:26.834 --> 21:28.134
Is the girl here?

21:28.201 --> 21:29.900
I mean, the spirit that you saw?

21:29.967 --> 21:32.667
- No. - Well, maybe, now that they've found her body,

21:32.667 --> 21:34.034
she's at peace?

21:35.101 --> 21:37.034
It's a step.

21:37.101 --> 21:38.967
What did you tell the police?

21:39.034 --> 21:41.034
Just that I was having it drained before I sold the place.

21:41.101 --> 21:42.433
You know, it's an insurance hazard

21:42.500 --> 21:44.900
And I didn't want anyone getting hurt.

21:44.967 --> 21:50.333
Um, Allison? could...Could a ghost have done that to her?

21:50.400 --> 21:53.101
I mean, caused an accident like that?

21:53.167 --> 21:55.600
I don't know. maybe.

21:55.667 --> 21:57.067
I'm sorry.

22:35.366 --> 22:36.433
Help me!

22:39.667 --> 22:42.600
What? what is it?

22:42.667 --> 22:45.433
The little girl.

22:45.433 --> 22:49.667
She might not be the only one that died.

22:49.667 --> 22:50.834
That was fast.

22:50.900 --> 22:52.500
Neighbors have built a shrine already.

22:53.934 --> 22:55.934
Yeah, it's all over the local news.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.600
Gretchen's been missing for 12 years.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.267
Are we gonna go talk to the family?

22:59.334 --> 23:00.767
It seems a little soon.

23:00.833 --> 23:02.067
No, the ghost.

23:02.134 --> 23:03.633
Look at me, Clay!

23:03.700 --> 23:06.134
I hate you! look at me!

23:06.200 --> 23:07.866
Look at what you did to me, clay.

23:07.866 --> 23:09.533
I hate you, clay.

23:12.367 --> 23:13.667
What is it? what's wrong?

23:13.733 --> 23:15.034
He did this to me.

23:15.100 --> 23:16.566
He killed me.

23:16.633 --> 23:18.367
Who is that?

23:18.433 --> 23:19.667
My brother.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.967
I just can't believe that a little boy

23:28.034 --> 23:31.000
would slice his sister into bits.

23:31.067 --> 23:32.867
Oh, he could.

23:32.934 --> 23:36.334
You're the search queen. type in "sororicide".

23:36.401 --> 23:38.767
That's sister-killing. you'll get 100 hits.

23:38.833 --> 23:39.800
Clay may have killed her,

23:39.800 --> 23:40.767
but he didn't chop her.

23:40.833 --> 23:42.934
- How do you know that? - I just got an e-mail

23:43.000 --> 23:44.833
From my friend down at the morgue.

23:44.900 --> 23:47.566
Even after 12 years, her skeleton was still intact.

23:47.633 --> 23:48.566
There were some minor fractures,

23:48.633 --> 23:51.034
But nothing that indicated dismemberment.

23:51.100 --> 23:52.301
What about the boy?

23:52.367 --> 23:55.200
I mean, were there any other bones down in the well?

23:55.267 --> 23:56.967
Nope. one set of bones.

23:57.034 --> 23:58.134
But you said he was a vision,

23:58.134 --> 23:59.234
not a spirit, right?

23:59.301 --> 24:00.267
So that means what happened to him

24:00.334 --> 24:02.633
Was something the little girl experienced.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.134
Ok.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.100
What if the armless boy that you saw

24:07.167 --> 24:08.533
Was clay's first kill?

24:08.600 --> 24:10.000
And she witnessed it.

24:10.067 --> 24:12.833
So if those were her dolls that were chopped into pieces...

24:12.900 --> 24:13.934
That could have been a warning.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.533
She could have seen what her brother had done

24:15.600 --> 24:16.667
And she was gonna narc on him.

24:16.733 --> 24:19.134
And to shut her up, he threw her down a well?

24:19.200 --> 24:20.334
Well...

24:20.401 --> 24:21.267
It's hard to believe.

24:21.267 --> 24:22.733
But I guess either way, we have to talk to the parents.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.301
Melinda, they just learned that their daughter

24:24.367 --> 24:25.500
Is never coming home alive.

24:25.501 --> 24:27.167
Yeah, but they also don't know that

24:27.167 --> 24:28.833
she still needs their help. and yours.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.034
Look, Eli, I'm serious.

24:30.100 --> 24:32.334
You're a very experienced grief counselor.

24:32.401 --> 24:34.700
You saw the news you're here to help,

24:34.767 --> 24:36.700
And you couldn't stop wondering about...

24:36.767 --> 24:38.633
Gretchen's relationship with her brother?

24:38.700 --> 24:42.533
Are you asking us how he handled the news?

24:42.600 --> 24:45.100
Oh. well, he can't even talk about it.

24:45.167 --> 24:46.566
But that's nothing new.

24:46.633 --> 24:50.533
Clay...

24:50.600 --> 24:52.800
Clay is so smart.

24:52.867 --> 24:54.367
He's such a good athlete.

24:54.433 --> 24:55.934
He was a great ball player.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.466
But when Gretchen went missing, he was devastated.

24:59.533 --> 25:02.733
He lost interest in everything. it was...

25:02.800 --> 25:05.566
It was like we lost him, too.

25:05.633 --> 25:07.600
How do you mean?

25:07.667 --> 25:09.034
"survivor's guilt".

25:09.100 --> 25:11.301
That's what the family therapist called it.

25:11.367 --> 25:13.367
I understand.

25:13.433 --> 25:15.200
But is it possible for Clay,

25:15.267 --> 25:17.967
Would he have anything specific to feel guilty about?

25:18.034 --> 25:21.134
In terms of Gretchen? did they get along?

25:21.200 --> 25:24.000
Well, they fought like any siblings.

25:24.067 --> 25:25.667
- He was older. - Typical boy.

25:26.733 --> 25:29.433
And Gretchen was such a little girl.

25:29.500 --> 25:32.000
It's gonna seem odd, but did she like to play with dolls?

25:32.067 --> 25:34.401
Don't most girls?

25:34.466 --> 25:35.566
What's odd about that?

25:35.633 --> 25:37.067
Did Clay ever do anything to her dolls?

25:37.134 --> 25:39.134
Not really.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.000
Well, they... no, wait, Aaron, they did.

25:43.633 --> 25:45.934
When, uh, when he was trying to get back at her

25:46.000 --> 25:48.566
For who knows what, he hid them. all of them.

25:48.633 --> 25:51.267
And Gretchen just about lost her mind.

25:51.334 --> 25:55.067
And that was all the ammunition he ever needed.

25:55.134 --> 25:56.800
Aaron, do you remember that? yeah.

25:56.867 --> 25:58.134
He used to do terrible things.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.733
He would hide them, hang them...

26:00.800 --> 26:01.934
Cut them into pieces?

26:04.000 --> 26:07.800
Well, yeah.

26:07.867 --> 26:10.000
I-I know that that sounds awful,

26:10.067 --> 26:12.367
But we just thought

26:12.433 --> 26:16.000
That's the way kids are.

26:16.067 --> 26:18.566
Aren't they?

26:18.633 --> 26:22.200
I have a delivery for Andrew's meatpacking.

26:22.267 --> 26:24.267
I'm-I'm looking for the main office.

26:24.334 --> 26:26.234
Third floor. I think someone's still up there

26:26.301 --> 26:27.466
If you need a signature.

26:29.566 --> 26:32.034
Oh, sorry about that. I'm on the clock.

26:32.100 --> 26:34.267
Thanks. you're welcome.

27:02.234 --> 27:04.301
No! no!

27:04.367 --> 27:06.500
No, no, help!

27:08.100 --> 27:10.000
Please, somebody help me! please!

27:20.700 --> 27:22.066
Hello?

27:22.067 --> 27:23.000
check this out.

27:23.067 --> 27:24.501
Can we talk later?

27:24.566 --> 27:27.267
I called the brothther, Clay at home and at work.

27:27.334 --> 27:28.367
He never called me back.

27:28.434 --> 27:30.134
So, basically you're calling to tell me

27:30.200 --> 27:31.134
That you have nothing to tell me.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.800
Sort of. you said the ghost was pissed

27:32.867 --> 27:34.367
- I'm just saying...  - oh. well, that's great.

27:34.434 --> 27:36.367
Well, thank you. um, ok. bye-bye.

27:36.434 --> 27:37.767
- Morning. - hey, good morning.

27:37.833 --> 27:39.501
How are you? I'm good, I'm good.

27:39.566 --> 27:41.367
And this is for you.

27:41.434 --> 27:42.533
I knew you'd be in a bit of a rush.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.633
I wanted to get it to you before you, uh...

27:44.700 --> 27:46.134
Ate. or didn't. it's not too late.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.167
You're not gonna be late for work, are you?

27:48.234 --> 27:50.900
No. no, this is...

27:50.967 --> 27:52.434
It's really nice of you.

27:52.501 --> 27:53.833
It's payback for all the good stuff

27:53.900 --> 27:55.900
You got me from the store. eat up, now.

27:58.633 --> 28:00.566
How is it? good? bad?

28:03.000 --> 28:05.367
Did you use orange rinds in the waffles?

28:05.434 --> 28:06.900
Good! I did, yeah. orange rinds,

28:06.967 --> 28:08.501
Organic maple syrup, a little fruit,

28:08.566 --> 28:10.700
Roasted pecans.

28:10.767 --> 28:11.900
Wait. you're not allergic to those?

28:11.967 --> 28:13.300
No.

28:15.434 --> 28:17.067
No, it's just something my husband did.

28:20.867 --> 28:24.067
- Sorry. - don't be.

28:24.134 --> 28:26.134
Really.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.134
It's perfect.

28:30.200 --> 28:32.467
I'm sorry I keep bringing him up. it's just...

28:32.533 --> 28:34.833
How could you not?

28:34.900 --> 28:36.401
I mean, uh...

28:36.467 --> 28:39.733
Look, you can talk about him to me anytime you want.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.034
Anytime.

28:41.100 --> 28:43.134
Which is something I have loads of now. time.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.300
Oh, that's right. I heard the news.

28:44.367 --> 28:46.200
- I'm sorry. - whatever.

28:46.267 --> 28:48.034
I guess all the work's been halted.

28:48.100 --> 28:49.633
So it goes.

28:49.700 --> 28:52.600
They found the body of a child in that well.

28:52.666 --> 28:55.034
You know, the well you were so curious about.

28:56.434 --> 28:57.800
I gotta ask you, um...

28:57.867 --> 28:59.566
What's the deal with that?

28:59.633 --> 29:01.401
Um, I don't know.

29:01.467 --> 29:03.034
I hope maybe the police can find out something.

29:03.100 --> 29:04.933
I was really talking about you.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.300
You know, all the questions you were asking about the well.

29:07.367 --> 29:08.600
And then when we were there,

29:08.666 --> 29:11.200
It's like you could sense something.

29:12.434 --> 29:14.200
I mean, it freaked you out.

29:17.334 --> 29:18.933
You're not psychic, are you?

29:19.000 --> 29:20.733
Uh, no.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.334
No, I'm not psychic.

29:22.401 --> 29:24.234
You're certainly popular.

29:24.300 --> 29:25.300
Hello, Eli.

29:25.367 --> 29:26.833
Mel. this time I have something.

29:26.900 --> 29:29.100
Clay's dispatcher just called me back.

29:29.167 --> 29:30.434
Seems our ghost has been hard at work

29:30.501 --> 29:31.900
Putting Clay on disability leave.

29:31.967 --> 29:33.566
What happened?

29:33.633 --> 29:34.666
He had an accident.

29:36.566 --> 29:38.533
I know you're gonna say I was getting ahead of myself,

29:38.600 --> 29:39.867
Reaching out to the brother

29:39.933 --> 29:41.600
Who probably killed his little sister.

29:41.666 --> 29:43.600
Manslaughter? murder? take your pick.

29:43.666 --> 29:45.267
How about you start a phone call with,

29:45.334 --> 29:47.401
"can you talk, or is this a bad time?"

29:47.467 --> 29:49.367
No. I want you to pick one, seriously.

29:51.067 --> 29:54.200
Oh, I get it. because Sam might be there.

29:54.267 --> 29:56.434
And you don't want him to know you have superpowers.

29:56.501 --> 29:58.200
- Right. - Got it. will do.

29:58.267 --> 30:00.067
But come on. you gonna pick or what?

30:00.134 --> 30:01.733
I'm inclined to go with manslaughter,

30:01.800 --> 30:03.600
Gretchen's death being some kind of accident.

30:03.666 --> 30:05.167
But there's something that keeps bothering me.

30:05.234 --> 30:06.900
One-armed joe?

30:06.967 --> 30:09.833
Ok, fine. that poor boy you saw with his arm cut off.

30:09.900 --> 30:12.134
You're thinking if Clay did kill his sister

30:12.200 --> 30:15.467
In some sort of weird, rough, freak tumble play accident,

30:15.533 --> 30:16.501
Who's the armless kid?

30:16.566 --> 30:18.034
Yeah, and how is he related to Clay?

30:18.100 --> 30:19.933
I called the school looking for a yearbook.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.267
See if you could I.d. old joe as one of his classmates.

30:22.334 --> 30:25.234
Then I remembered. Clay was a little league star.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.633
So maybe joe was one of the kids on his team.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.867
I don't know. maybe he's lost his arm

30:28.933 --> 30:30.967
In some kind of freak accident that Gretchen saw.

30:31.034 --> 30:34.000
- A double accident?  - yeah.

30:34.067 --> 30:37.334
That's him. that's the boy I saw.

30:37.401 --> 30:38.900
That's one-armed joe?

30:38.967 --> 30:40.200
That's Clay Dennis, Gretchen's brother.

30:40.267 --> 30:41.267
I'm telling you, that's him.

30:41.334 --> 30:43.134
He can't be both Butcher and victim.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.767
Gretchen blames him, so he has to be involved somehow.

30:45.833 --> 30:47.501
Well, if he wants to hang onto the rest of his limbs,

30:47.566 --> 30:48.633
He'd better start talking.

30:52.666 --> 30:53.967
You know, the warning label on these

30:54.034 --> 30:56.700
Says that you're not supposed to drive.

30:58.367 --> 30:59.733
I don't think that's a problem.

31:01.401 --> 31:04.200
There's another warning you should know. um...

31:04.267 --> 31:05.933
I see spirits.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.401
I've seen your sister. she's angry at you.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.800
Ok. you saw my sister's ghost.

31:11.867 --> 31:12.900
Yes.

31:12.967 --> 31:14.633
And the fact that I talk to ghosts

31:14.700 --> 31:16.600
Is not something I like to admit

31:16.666 --> 31:19.733
Unless I feel like someone's life might be in danger.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.666
Look, lady. what happened to my arm?

31:22.733 --> 31:25.034
That was just a... freak thing.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.967
No, I don't think so.

31:27.034 --> 31:28.566
It's too similar to a vision that I had.

31:28.633 --> 31:31.100
You were a kid, 10 or 11.

31:31.167 --> 31:34.067
And that same arm was injured. missing, in fact.

31:34.134 --> 31:36.533
Ok, please stop.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.334
I know exactly what you're talking about,

31:38.401 --> 31:40.467
But how...

31:44.800 --> 31:47.566
Oh, my god.

31:47.633 --> 31:48.900
Because my sister told you.

31:50.267 --> 31:52.200
In a way.

31:52.267 --> 31:54.434
She showed me severed arms and legs.

31:54.501 --> 31:55.666
I had no way to connect it,

31:55.733 --> 31:58.234
Except to her dolls and what you had done to them.

31:58.300 --> 32:01.501
What I did to them.

32:01.566 --> 32:02.633
She tell you what I did to her?

32:02.700 --> 32:05.401
Did she tell you that?

32:05.467 --> 32:07.666
I was so mean to her.

32:07.733 --> 32:11.067
She was such a stubborn tag-along.

32:11.134 --> 32:12.900
She was always getting into my stuff.

32:12.967 --> 32:14.401
Move!

32:14.467 --> 32:16.666
There were times when I literally hated her.

32:16.733 --> 32:20.100
This one time, I was convinced that she slit my tires.

32:20.167 --> 32:21.501
What is the matter with you?

32:21.566 --> 32:23.401
I didn't touch your stupid bike!

32:23.467 --> 32:24.533
Clay, what did you do to your sister? what's wrong with you?

32:24.600 --> 32:25.967
I didn't do it, I promise!

32:26.034 --> 32:28.067
So I went nuts on her dolls.

32:28.134 --> 32:31.700
Hiding them, hanging them.

32:31.767 --> 32:34.933
She'd run, tell my parents,

32:35.000 --> 32:37.800
And write down in this little notepad of hers,

32:37.867 --> 32:39.666
You know, about how she hated me right back.

32:39.733 --> 32:41.633
Writing those stupid notes won't do anything.

32:41.700 --> 32:44.034
Shut up and leave me alone.

32:47.933 --> 32:50.401
One day, I don't even know what she did

32:50.467 --> 32:51.633
To bug me, really,

32:51.700 --> 32:54.300
But I just chopped up all of her dolls.

33:10.100 --> 33:12.501
Mom! Clay killed my dolls!

33:14.067 --> 33:16.067
I got grounded for 2 weeks.

33:16.134 --> 33:17.767
I was home alone,

33:17.833 --> 33:20.100
Saw her latest entry.

33:20.167 --> 33:22.434
She'd torn out the page, but I could see the imprint.

33:26.833 --> 33:29.200
She wrote, "i wish Clay's arms and legs were cut off."

33:32.566 --> 33:34.900
She wished for you the same fate as her dolls.

33:34.967 --> 33:39.566
And when my parents were gone,

33:39.633 --> 33:41.434
I made that wish come true.

33:54.234 --> 33:58.566
Help me! Is this what you wanted? what did you do to me?

34:00.467 --> 34:05.267
I tried to stop her before she could call my parents or 911.

34:05.334 --> 34:08.367
I heard the screen door to the kitchen slam.

34:08.434 --> 34:11.766
Gretchen, come back. it was just a joke.

34:11.833 --> 34:13.467
She was already gone.

34:15.900 --> 34:17.400
She didn't come back that night.

34:17.467 --> 34:19.666
Or the next, or the next.

34:21.467 --> 34:24.699
I don't know what I was thinking.

34:24.766 --> 34:28.067
She was 8 years old.

34:30.733 --> 34:35.100
I heard my mom sobbing every night.

34:35.167 --> 34:38.666
"how could this have happened?"

34:38.733 --> 34:41.199
I knew.

34:41.266 --> 34:42.833
But what I didn't know

34:42.900 --> 34:44.367
Was what happened to Gretchen

34:44.434 --> 34:46.666
After I scared her away.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.034
Do you?

34:53.234 --> 34:55.800
No.

34:55.867 --> 34:58.034
But I'll find out.

34:58.100 --> 34:59.700
I promise.

35:03.334 --> 35:05.967
I saw you talking to him.

35:06.034 --> 35:07.566
Gretchen, he didn't mean to hurt you.

35:07.633 --> 35:09.300
He's been scared for you ever since.

35:09.367 --> 35:11.700
I've been in the dark,

35:11.767 --> 35:13.067
In the cold.

35:13.134 --> 35:15.034
All this time I was afraid to go home.

35:15.100 --> 35:16.967
Because you thought your wish had come true?

35:17.034 --> 35:19.600
But he's fine. it was just a trick.

35:19.666 --> 35:21.900
- No, he's not fine.  - he's alive,

35:21.967 --> 35:23.600
And I'm dead and it's all his fault.

35:23.666 --> 35:26.700
He would give anything to take it back.

35:28.867 --> 35:32.167
There are no take backs when it comes to the well.

35:32.234 --> 35:33.967
Ask your friend Sam.

35:59.734 --> 36:02.800
I don't get it. why is the ghost going after Sam?

36:03.066 --> 36:05.200
I thought she was mad at her brother.

36:05.267 --> 36:07.066
I'm dealing with an angry 8-year-old

36:07.133 --> 36:09.233
Who keeps changing the rules as she goes.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.467
None of it explains how she got down the well.

36:11.534 --> 36:12.867
She wrote a note

36:12.933 --> 36:15.901
Asking for the well's help in punishing her brother.

36:15.966 --> 36:18.567
That's how this all started. but then, Eli and i

36:18.634 --> 36:20.600
Found this

36:20.667 --> 36:22.567
With her dolls at the old house.

36:23.767 --> 36:26.901
"i wish he could know she was here."

36:26.966 --> 36:28.933
- Did her brother write this?  - no, I don't think so.

36:30.667 --> 36:32.667
Where are those tiles that Sam brought?

36:32.734 --> 36:34.333
I put them over here.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.534
I wasn't sure if you were serious

36:35.600 --> 36:38.700
About selling it as a garden fixture.

36:38.767 --> 36:41.966
What do the tiles have to do with any of this?

36:42.033 --> 36:44.901
This is how I'm gonna get Gretchen to tell me the truth.

36:56.467 --> 36:58.567
"make a wish of your very own.

36:58.634 --> 37:01.534
"hide it deep within the stone".

37:01.600 --> 37:03.066
Gretchen, you thought the well had real powers

37:03.133 --> 37:04.867
And that's how your brother got hurt.

37:06.267 --> 37:07.667
Can I speak to her?

37:07.734 --> 37:11.300
She's here. she's angry.

37:11.367 --> 37:12.966
Like she was the time that she made a wish

37:13.033 --> 37:14.467
Wanting to hurt you.

37:16.567 --> 37:17.834
Hide it deep within the stone.

37:17.901 --> 37:19.767
Is it still in the stone?

37:19.834 --> 37:21.700
I watched it fall away over time.

37:21.767 --> 37:24.600
Years and years I was down there.

37:24.667 --> 37:26.200
Because of you.

37:26.267 --> 37:27.767
Look, whatever she's saying,

37:27.834 --> 37:29.734
Please just tell her I'm sorry.

37:29.801 --> 37:32.200
She's sorry, too.

37:32.267 --> 37:35.567
Even if she doesn't remember feeling that way.

37:35.634 --> 37:36.700
When you thought your wish had come true

37:36.767 --> 37:39.100
And you saw your brother bleeding,

37:39.167 --> 37:40.400
Maybe even dying...

37:40.467 --> 37:43.267
You came here to take back your wish, didn't you?

37:44.200 --> 37:45.834
It was so hard to reach.

38:01.434 --> 38:03.033
You said there were no takebacks.

38:03.100 --> 38:04.700
You're right.

38:04.767 --> 38:07.300
Even though you want to,

38:07.367 --> 38:09.834
No one can change what's happened.

38:09.901 --> 38:11.933
But you can grant one more wish.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.534
You can help your brother forgive himself.

38:17.467 --> 38:20.367
All I ever wanted to do was be with him.

38:20.434 --> 38:22.467
No matter what he did.

38:22.534 --> 38:23.966
She always looked up to you.

38:24.033 --> 38:26.667
She wanted to be with you.

38:26.734 --> 38:28.100
But I was so mean to you.

38:29.966 --> 38:32.867
And you were just a kid.

38:32.933 --> 38:34.233
You were a kid, too.

38:34.300 --> 38:38.067
Will you tell him I love him and forgive him?

38:38.334 --> 38:38.999
I will.

38:39.634 --> 38:41.467
She understands now.

38:41.534 --> 38:43.534
That it was a horrible accident.

38:47.634 --> 38:50.233
Same goes for you.

38:50.300 --> 38:53.500
She wasn't in the well when your girlfriend had her accident.

38:53.567 --> 38:56.400
There was no spirit, no magic.

38:56.467 --> 38:57.700
You didn't make that happen.

38:57.767 --> 38:59.634
Yeah, I didn't need a ghost's help.

38:59.700 --> 39:02.467
I mean, I might not have gotten what I wanted,

39:02.534 --> 39:05.033
But I definitely got what I deserved.

39:05.100 --> 39:06.534
Allison, are you ok?

39:06.600 --> 39:08.000
Go away!

39:08.066 --> 39:09.100
Go away!

39:09.167 --> 39:10.200
- Allison... - get away from me!

39:10.267 --> 39:12.400
Still, I can't help but wishing...

39:12.467 --> 39:14.200
Wishing you did something different.

39:14.267 --> 39:16.000
So does she.

39:16.066 --> 39:18.066
Who?

39:18.133 --> 39:20.667
The woman who left the note.

39:20.734 --> 39:23.367
The one who came here

39:23.434 --> 39:24.467
With your daughter.

39:24.534 --> 39:27.400
Of course.

39:27.467 --> 39:28.634
The other note.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.434
"i wish that he could know she was here."

39:30.500 --> 39:33.534
Wha...what other note? what is she saying?

39:33.600 --> 39:36.933
I think she's talking about your girlfriend,

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Allison.

40:15.434 --> 40:18.834
12 years. and she'd been living here the whole time.

40:18.901 --> 40:20.933
In Lewiston. half an hour away.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.500
She was hurt.

40:23.567 --> 40:25.066
Let him think that she had lost the baby

40:25.133 --> 40:27.333
So she wouldn't force a child on him.

40:27.733 --> 40:29.300
Didn't she think he have the right to know?

40:29.333 --> 40:31.167
I think she wanted him, too.

40:31.233 --> 40:33.333
It's just, as the years passed,

40:33.400 --> 40:34.600
It got harder to tell him.

40:34.667 --> 40:37.434
So, the visits to the well.

40:37.500 --> 40:38.933
I guess so.

40:40.933 --> 40:43.233
So far, so good. right.

40:47.567 --> 40:49.834
What? is she here?

40:49.901 --> 40:51.300
Figured while I'm here,

40:51.367 --> 40:53.167
I might as well help people.

40:53.233 --> 40:54.966
Like your friend Sam.

40:55.033 --> 40:56.966
Sam?

40:57.033 --> 41:01.100
It was dark for so long.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.801
Now it's so warm and bright.

41:03.867 --> 41:06.400
What did you do for Sam?

41:09.867 --> 41:11.933
I gave him what he wanted.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.367
Something he really wanted.

41:14.434 --> 41:16.700
Turns out it was something he already had.

41:16.767 --> 41:18.300
What?

41:18.367 --> 41:20.767
A piece of his life back.

41:36.534 --> 41:39.033
Which life?

41:47.567 --> 41:49.033
Thank you.

42:18.801 --> 42:20.133
It's been kind of a weird day,

42:20.200 --> 42:22.100
And I didn't know who else I could talk to about it.

42:23.467 --> 42:24.966
Ok.

42:25.033 --> 42:27.133
I was going through all my stuff,

42:27.200 --> 42:29.333
And I found a key.

42:29.400 --> 42:30.767
I know it's strange, I've been hoping...

42:30.834 --> 42:33.434
Wishing for a clue.

42:33.500 --> 42:35.233
Something to tell me who I was.

42:35.300 --> 42:37.233
Right?

42:43.167 --> 42:45.200
Guess I got more than I bargained for.

42:55.233 --> 42:57.367
Are you sure this belongs to you?

42:57.434 --> 42:58.867
Yeah.

42:58.933 --> 43:01.100
My name was right on the receipt, Sam Lucas.

43:01.167 --> 43:03.100
I bought that less than a month ago.

43:06.100 --> 43:08.300
Question is,

43:08.367 --> 43:10.000
Who did I buy it for?

43:11.305 --> 43:17.907
