WEBVTT

02:26.188 --> 02:27.355
Wu.

02:27.356 --> 02:30.942
You and your brothers
murdered three of our men.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.570
He would have done the same.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.448
<i>Send three more
and I'll kill them too.</i>

02:36.323 --> 02:39.701
He already controls
the opium trade all across Asia.

02:39.702 --> 02:41.953
<i>May no one prosper but Ying Ko?</i>

02:41.954 --> 02:44.956
<i>My poppy fields are tiny...
nothing compared to his.</i>

02:44.957 --> 02:48.753
Well, I, Li Peng, at least
I'm entitled to my little piece.

02:49.628 --> 02:52.338
Ying Ko, if you kill me,

02:52.339 --> 02:56.509
I promise my brothers
will come for you.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.929
And I promise you...

03:01.974 --> 03:04.726
I'll bury them beside you.

03:04.727 --> 03:06.228
<i>Kill him.</i>

03:13.319 --> 03:15.028
Let me go.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.571
<i>I only wish to leave.</i>

03:16.572 --> 03:17.698
I'll cut his throat.

03:18.824 --> 03:21.577
Your men are not marksmen enough
to shoot around him.

03:22.286 --> 03:25.206
You're right.
You're right.

03:26.499 --> 03:29.083
Wu, you are a wonderful friend.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.752
<i>Like a father to me.</i>

03:30.753 --> 03:32.505
Thank you, Ying Ko.

03:35.257 --> 03:36.300
Shoot through him.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.968
Uh!

04:31.730 --> 04:33.314
Where are you taking me?

04:33.315 --> 04:36.985
The Tulku wishes to see you
at his temple.

04:36.986 --> 04:39.238
A holy man wants to see me?

04:41.240 --> 04:43.199
You call that a temple?

04:43.200 --> 04:45.243
No.
There.

04:58.007 --> 04:59.425
Where did that come from?

05:00.718 --> 05:03.012
The clouded mind sees nothing.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.263
Who are you?

05:46.639 --> 05:48.556
I am your teacher.

05:48.557 --> 05:52.728
Do you have any idea
who you just kidnapped?

05:53.354 --> 05:54.980
Cranston.

05:55.940 --> 05:57.732
Lamont Cranston.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.150
You know my real name?

05:59.151 --> 06:00.694
Yes.

06:02.780 --> 06:07.116
I also know that for as long
as you can remember,

06:07.117 --> 06:10.745
you've struggled against your own
black heart and always lost.

06:10.746 --> 06:14.457
You watched your spirit,
your very face change

06:14.458 --> 06:17.168
<i>as the beast claws
his way out within you.</i>

06:17.169 --> 06:21.006
You're in great pain,
aren't you?

06:24.468 --> 06:26.844
You know what evil lurks
in the hearts of men,

06:26.845 --> 06:29.055
<i>for you have seen that evil
in your own heart.</i>

06:29.056 --> 06:32.016
Every man pays the price
for redemption.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.978
- This is yours.
- I'm not lookin' for redemption.

06:34.979 --> 06:36.980
You have no choice.

06:36.981 --> 06:39.899
You will be redeemed
because I will teach you

06:39.900 --> 06:42.986
<i>to use your black shadow
to fight evil.</i>

06:42.987 --> 06:44.113
I wouldn't do that.

07:34.455 --> 07:35.622
Phurba.

07:40.711 --> 07:41.879
<i>Phurba!</i>

07:45.090 --> 07:46.508
Am I in hell?

07:49.887 --> 07:51.722
Not yet.

08:51.532 --> 08:52.990
Get him, Johnny.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.535
Maxie.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.619
All right,
let's get this over with.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.329
- Get out.
- No.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.289
- Come on, come on!
- No, please.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.959
- Eh, quit your whining.
- I didn't see anything.

09:03.085 --> 09:04.169
Is it dry?

09:05.212 --> 09:07.548
Perfect, Duke.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.757
Bring him to the rail.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.259
- Tip him.
- I won't tell anyone.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.262
- I swear.
- Jeez.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.682
I wish I could trust you,
sport, I really do.

09:17.683 --> 09:20.185
I guess you just picked
the wrong alley to look down.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.062
I have a family.

09:22.646 --> 09:24.147
They'll get over it.

09:24.148 --> 09:25.107
I won't talk.

09:25.691 --> 09:27.401
I- I'm telling you.

09:28.527 --> 09:30.279
Oh, I know you won't.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.198
- Dump him.
- No!

09:34.199 --> 09:36.450
- No, no!
- I hate heavy lifting.

09:36.451 --> 09:39.537
No, no, no!

09:43.125 --> 09:44.500
What the Christ was that?

09:44.501 --> 09:45.877
Who's there?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.347
Show yourself, fella.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.601
<i>You murdered a policeman, Duke.</i>

10:01.602 --> 10:03.686
Who said that?
Duke?

10:03.687 --> 10:05.438
- Who said that?
- Shut up!

10:05.439 --> 10:08.941
<i>The weed of crime
bears bitter fruit.</i>

10:08.942 --> 10:10.693
I don't like this.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.529
This stinks.
Let's get the hell outta here.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.698
Shut your hole, Maxie!

10:15.699 --> 10:17.825
<i>Did you think
you'd get away with it?</i>

10:17.826 --> 10:19.118
Come on, Duke!

10:22.372 --> 10:26.626
<i>Did you think
I wouldn't know?</i>

11:00.786 --> 11:03.622
- Hah!
- Duke, I think you got him.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.501
You're damn right I...

11:14.049 --> 11:16.676
<i>You committed murder, Duke.</i>

11:16.677 --> 11:18.803
<i>Now you're going
to confess to it.</i>

11:18.804 --> 11:20.263
Like hell I will.

11:20.264 --> 11:21.806
<i>You will, Duke.</i>

11:21.807 --> 11:24.559
<i>Because if you don't,
I'll be there.</i>

11:26.979 --> 11:30.690
<i>I'll be there...
around every corner,</i>

11:30.691 --> 11:33.109
<i>in every empty room.</i>

11:33.110 --> 11:36.445
<i>As inevitable
as your guilty conscience.</i>

11:36.446 --> 11:38.114
You don't scare me!

11:38.115 --> 11:40.367
<i>You son of a...</i>

11:43.662 --> 11:45.746
<i>You will go
to the 8th precinct house</i>

11:45.747 --> 11:48.833
<i>on Second Avenue
and surrender yourself.</i>

11:48.834 --> 11:50.209
<i>And you will do it now.</i>

11:50.210 --> 11:52.921
I confess, I confess,
I'll do it, I'll do it!

11:54.047 --> 11:56.633
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

11:57.342 --> 11:59.635
I'll confess, for God's sake,
I don't want to die!

13:19.925 --> 13:21.301
<i>Drive.</i>

13:25.639 --> 13:27.390
Thank you.

13:27.391 --> 13:29.225
You fellas are probably busy.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.851
You can just drop me off
anywhere along...

13:30.852 --> 13:32.478
<i>You're Doctor Roy Tam,</i>

13:32.479 --> 13:36.023
a professor in the science
department at NYU.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.108
Yes.

13:37.109 --> 13:39.902
I've saved your life, Roy Tam.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.238
It now belongs to me.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.657
It does?

13:47.536 --> 13:50.287
You'll become one of my agents.

13:50.288 --> 13:53.499
Like dozens of others
all over the world.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.169
Could, I, uh, ask
my wife about this?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.131
No!

14:01.258 --> 14:03.217
Mr. Shrevnitz here,
will instruct you

14:03.218 --> 14:07.555
in the way I will contact you
should I require your help.

14:07.556 --> 14:10.141
When you hear one
of my agents say,

14:10.142 --> 14:12.144
"The sun is shining,"

14:13.186 --> 14:17.982
you will respond,
"But the ice is slippery."

14:17.983 --> 14:20.693
This will identify you
to each other.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.278
Do you understand?

14:22.279 --> 14:24.905
Th-the sun is shining.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.492
But the ice is slippery.

14:28.285 --> 14:30.454
Uh, tell me one thing...

14:31.204 --> 14:33.998
How did you know
what was happening to me?

14:33.999 --> 14:36.292
How did you know who I am?

14:42.591 --> 14:44.967
The shadow knows.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.573
Thank you.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.033
That's the shadow.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.826
I mean, that's the shadow.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.453
Hey, you're a pretty smart guy.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.497
Well, I heard rumors
in the paper, on the radio,

15:14.498 --> 15:15.748
but I thought it was just talk.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.333
I didn't think he existed.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.294
He doesn't.
Get it?

15:23.340 --> 15:25.300
Don't ever take it off.

15:26.468 --> 15:27.885
Wait a minute.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.637
Who are you?

15:29.638 --> 15:32.640
Somebody who owes him his life.

15:32.641 --> 15:35.101
Somebody just like you.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.333
Boss, you okay?

16:01.002 --> 16:02.212
The Cobalt Club.

Sorry I'm late,
Uncle Wainwright,

17:30.175 --> 17:34.386
but there was a little, uh,
accident on the bridge.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.430
Well, I didn't think
you wanted me to wait.

17:36.431 --> 17:39.475
Incidentally, try the, uh, prime rib.
It's excellent.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.810
- You're usual, Mr. Cranston.
- Oh, yes.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.606
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

17:45.482 --> 17:48.693
You know, Lamont, I'm...
I'm very upset with you.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.028
What is it this time?

17:51.029 --> 17:53.656
<i>What is it this time?
What is it every time?</i>

17:53.657 --> 17:56.241
<i>You ask me to dinner
and show up an hour late.</i>

17:56.242 --> 17:57.910
<i>There's simply no excuse
for that kind of behavior.</i>

17:57.911 --> 18:00.372
Uncle Wainwright,
I'm sorry, I, uh...

18:03.458 --> 18:05.084
I got caught up.

18:05.085 --> 18:08.212
<i>With what, for God sake?
You don't do anything.</i>

18:08.213 --> 18:10.255
<i>A man your age is unseemly.</i>

18:10.256 --> 18:12.925
<i>At least pick
a hobby or something.</i>

18:12.926 --> 18:15.260
<i>Why am I talking
to the back of your neck?</i>

18:15.261 --> 18:18.639
Lamont?
Lamont!

18:18.640 --> 18:19.974
I'm sorry,
what were we talking about?

18:20.558 --> 18:22.643
You know, I've never meddled
in your affairs.

18:22.644 --> 18:25.688
Going back to the time that
after the war,

18:25.689 --> 18:27.940
when you disappeared
for some seven years.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.817
<i>I never asked any questions then.
I'm not asking any questions now.</i>

18:29.818 --> 18:31.151
<i>Excuse me,
Police Commissioner Barth.</i>

18:31.152 --> 18:34.571
- Urgent message for you, sir.
- Thank you.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.824
What's the matter, cops and robbers
business slowing down?

18:36.825 --> 18:37.784
Mm-mm.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.497
It's a report of that damn
Shadow character again.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.874
I thought you said
he was only a rumor.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.626
I'm sick of the Shadow business...

18:47.627 --> 18:49.586
his meddling in police affairs.

18:49.587 --> 18:50.922
This time tomorrow...

18:52.257 --> 18:53.925
I'll put a task force on him.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.726
You're not going
to appoint a task force.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.228
No, hell with him.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.063
I'm not going
to appoint a task force.

19:08.064 --> 19:12.443
You're not going to pay any attention
to these reports of the Shadow.

19:12.444 --> 19:13.820
Ignore them entirely.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.281
There is no Shadow.

19:17.615 --> 19:18.699
No, there is no Shadow.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.035
If there were,
I'd be Eleanor Roosevelt.

19:24.122 --> 19:26.040
Mm, where was I?

19:27.250 --> 19:30.252
You were about
to tell me who she is.

19:30.253 --> 19:31.503
That's Margo Lane.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.298
Her father's a scientist working
for the War Department.

19:34.299 --> 19:37.050
What the hell do you see in her?

19:37.051 --> 19:40.096
Uncle Wainwright, are you sure
you're not dead?

19:41.055 --> 19:42.639
Not by a long shot.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.855
<i>Do</i> yourself a favor...
stay away from her.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.065
She's strange.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.861
She hears voices.
That's what they say.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.696
Really?

19:59.616 --> 20:02.534
Yes, I would like a glass
of the Mouton...

20:02.535 --> 20:04.120
Rothschild 1928.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.163
Yes.

20:06.164 --> 20:08.500
- From the gentleman.
- Gentleman?

20:10.543 --> 20:12.920
Lamont Cranston.

20:12.921 --> 20:14.047
May I sit?

20:23.264 --> 20:27.184
You know...
it's the strangest thing,

20:27.185 --> 20:32.357
but I have this sudden craving
for Peking duck.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.943
That's so odd.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.738
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.656
Care to join me?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.124
You speak Chinese.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.001
Only Mandarin.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.380
Well, aren't you full
of surprises.

20:58.341 --> 20:59.842
Thank you.

20:59.843 --> 21:01.885
I'm glad you like it.

21:01.886 --> 21:04.555
Oh, I had it made,
uh, at Adrian's.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.098
Why did you just tell me that?

21:06.099 --> 21:11.144
Well, you just complemented
me on my dress just now.

21:11.145 --> 21:13.565
- Didn't you?
- No, I didn't.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.026
But I was thinking it.

21:17.443 --> 21:22.489
Oh, now that hasn't happened
to me in a long, long time.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.950
Since I was a little girl
with my cousin Harry,

21:24.951 --> 21:26.159
I could hear
what he was thinking.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.288
Just pick the thoughts right out
of his head before he said a word.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.916
It was the strangest thing
and I never was able...

21:35.086 --> 21:36.337
ls-is something bothering you?

21:37.463 --> 21:41.341
Oh' no' no' no'.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.553
<i>- Not at all.
- Oh.</i>

22:02.864 --> 22:06.033
Well, thank you.
I had a wonderful time.

22:06.034 --> 22:10.330
I'm not sure I can recall
an evening as... stimulating.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.086
Good night Miss Lane.

22:18.212 --> 22:19.923
Good night, Mr. Cranston.

22:28.389 --> 22:29.723
<i>I like her, boss.</i>

22:29.724 --> 22:32.059
She's different than
your usual dames.

22:32.060 --> 22:34.102
More than even she knows.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.479
<i>How's that?</i>

22:35.480 --> 22:37.649
She has ability she's
completely unaware of.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.067
No kidding?

22:40.068 --> 22:41.235
You going to see her again?

22:42.111 --> 22:44.363
No, it's much too dangerous.

22:44.364 --> 22:46.239
Dangerous for who?

22:46.240 --> 22:47.742
For me, Moe.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.453
For me.

23:23.027 --> 23:24.529
Someone's coming.

23:48.553 --> 23:49.845
Well, what is it?

23:49.846 --> 23:51.805
That's just it, sir,
I don't know.

23:51.806 --> 23:55.142
Why, I would have labeled it a mummy
case, coming from Tibet like it did.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.519
Mummy cases come
from Egypt, Berger.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.022
Well, that's right, exactly.

23:59.188 --> 24:02.399
Besides, the thing is metal, which made
me think it was a sarcophagus.

24:02.400 --> 24:06.820
No, Tibetan sarcophagi
were of stone.

24:06.821 --> 24:09.489
Uh, what happened to the truckman
who dropped it off?

24:09.490 --> 24:11.366
Gone.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.660
Well, it's obviously
an incorrect shipment.

24:13.661 --> 24:16.080
Call our, uh,
customs broker and...

24:17.540 --> 24:19.624
My God.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.919
This is beautiful.

24:24.422 --> 24:26.590
That is solid silver.

24:26.591 --> 24:28.509
Nelson, help us take
the sides off.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.357
<i>What does it say?</i>

24:44.358 --> 24:45.901
<i>It's Latin.</i>

24:45.902 --> 24:49.654
<i>Kha Khan,
dei potestas, in Terra.</i>

24:49.655 --> 24:52.449
"The power of God on Earth,

24:52.450 --> 24:56.662
the seal
of the Emperor of Mankind."

24:58.414 --> 24:59.624
Oh, my God.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.503
Temujin.

25:06.506 --> 25:09.508
This is the silver coffin
of Temujin.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.802
Who's Temujin?

25:11.803 --> 25:15.556
The man who very nearly conquered
the globe eight centuries ago.

25:15.723 --> 25:18.142
Well, how come
I never heard of him?

25:21.145 --> 25:23.648
Temujin was the birth name...

25:25.441 --> 25:27.819
of Genghis Khan.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.530
What was the shipper's address?

25:31.531 --> 25:34.282
It didn't say.

25:34.283 --> 25:37.286
Label just had
the country of origin.

25:38.371 --> 25:41.123
Let me make a telephone call.

25:41.124 --> 25:43.543
Let me help you.

25:44.836 --> 25:49.215
Nelson, whatever you do,
don't open it.

25:50.550 --> 25:51.843
No, sir.

26:13.573 --> 26:16.075
♪ Come on along and listen to ♪

26:17.118 --> 26:19.078

This is...
this is private property.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.846
Your mind is weak.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.057
Don't come any closer.

28:04.767 --> 28:06.644
Fall to your knees.

28:11.649 --> 28:15.194
Put your gun to your temple.

Yes, my Khan.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.744
<i>You didn't hear me, did you?</i>

29:05.745 --> 29:08.413
<i>I'm through
with the beryllium sphere.</i>

29:08.414 --> 29:11.166
I'm just doing some underwater
tests to check pressure.

29:11.167 --> 29:15.879
Farley, I have told you a dozen times
we are doing energy research.

29:15.880 --> 29:19.215
I'm not interested in any military
application of the project.

29:19.216 --> 29:21.259
Oh, yeah?

29:21.260 --> 29:23.511
So, why do you let the War Department
pay all the bills?

29:23.512 --> 29:25.014
'Cause you talked me into it.

29:25.765 --> 29:27.933
I just wanted
enough money to finish.

29:29.060 --> 29:32.270
Dr. Lane, you don't think big.

29:32.271 --> 29:35.482
If you'd only listen to me,
the world could be our oyster.

29:35.483 --> 29:37.275
Oysters?

29:37.276 --> 29:39.320
I get a rash from oysters.

29:50.748 --> 29:54.167
Oh, Margo.

29:54.168 --> 29:56.879
What a beautiful dress.

29:57.797 --> 30:01.299
And such a clever neckline.

30:01.300 --> 30:04.136
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Claymore,
I'd like to see my father.

30:06.389 --> 30:08.057
So...

30:09.392 --> 30:12.310
When are you going to come down
and see my beryllium sphere?

30:12.311 --> 30:15.564
I'm not interested
in your spheres, Mr. Claymore.

30:19.860 --> 30:24.990
Margo, you don't return
my calls anymore.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.659
Well, that's not true.

30:27.660 --> 30:29.829
I never did return your calls.

30:30.413 --> 30:33.624
I know.
I can't imagine why.

30:35.709 --> 30:39.130
It's because I don't like you.

30:44.677 --> 30:46.720
What a fascinating woman.

30:47.847 --> 30:51.724
Uh! Dad, I don't know how
you can work with that man.

30:51.725 --> 30:55.104
Margo, what a nice surprise.
Hm?

30:56.397 --> 30:57.522
Hi.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.816
Hey, have you had your dinner?
Hm?

30:59.817 --> 31:02.361
- Yes, dad, it's two a.m.
- Mm, mm.

31:03.571 --> 31:05.405
Dad, where did you
get this shirt?

31:05.406 --> 31:08.241
Mm, well, you said
I look good in green, hm?

31:08.242 --> 31:12.579
No, this is green, that's red.

31:12.580 --> 31:15.457
Mm, red, green, mm.

31:15.458 --> 31:17.001
Well, to me
it's just a clean shirt.

31:22.256 --> 31:23.798
<i>' Dad?
Hm?</i>

31:23.799 --> 31:25.508
Do you believe in telepathy?

31:25.509 --> 31:26.801
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

31:26.802 --> 31:32.016
I mean, do you believe that it can
exist between certain people?

31:32.558 --> 31:34.392
You mean mind reading?

31:34.393 --> 31:37.062
Well, of course I don't, dear.
I'm a scientist.

31:38.439 --> 31:40.316
So strange.

31:41.734 --> 31:45.445
I've always had this feeling
that there was this...

31:45.446 --> 31:48.781
indescribable connection
out there

31:48.782 --> 31:50.743
just waiting for me.

31:51.952 --> 31:55.456
<i>And suddenly tonight
there it was.</i>

31:56.207 --> 31:57.583
Well, that's nice, dear.

31:58.876 --> 32:00.044
What was it?

32:02.046 --> 32:03.672
It was a man.

32:05.883 --> 32:09.052
And I'm probably never
gonna see him again.

32:09.053 --> 32:10.513
But why not?

32:11.222 --> 32:13.432
I just know.

32:15.976 --> 32:19.021
It was as though I could sense
what he was feeling.

32:21.607 --> 32:25.611
And now I'm completely
and utterly depressed.

32:26.570 --> 32:28.405
Well, that's nice, dear.

32:33.994 --> 32:36.080
Okay, that'll be four forty-five.

32:36.664 --> 32:37.997
What are you doing?

32:37.998 --> 32:39.832
Writin' down a drop-off point.

32:39.833 --> 32:42.710
You're making a record
of my destination?

32:42.711 --> 32:44.713
Taxi commission's rules.

32:53.264 --> 32:55.099
All right, Reilly, back her up.

32:56.475 --> 32:57.726
<i>That's it.</i>

33:00.020 --> 33:01.272
You need fuel.

33:04.984 --> 33:06.652
Jeez, I need gas.

33:08.571 --> 33:09.655
Cut left, that's it.

33:09.989 --> 33:11.615
Hey, thanks.

33:17.746 --> 33:19.748
Look <i>out!</i>

33:21.917 --> 33:23.460
This must be my lucky...

34:05.377 --> 34:07.170
Well, what's going on?

34:07.171 --> 34:09.213
Inspector Cardona's
in charge, sir.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.882
He's, uh, over there.

34:13.217 --> 34:14.344
Mm.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.641
Well, I don't know
what to think.

36:16.592 --> 36:18.218
Hey, what are you, crazy?

36:19.553 --> 36:21.305
- Out.
- Thank you.

36:27.352 --> 36:28.520
To The Sanctum.

36:39.156 --> 36:40.741
Go, go.

36:41.408 --> 36:44.161
Come on, lady,
there's no parking there... come on.

36:53.754 --> 36:56.924
Hey, Louie,
save that cab for me!

37:44.763 --> 37:45.805
Report.

37:45.806 --> 37:50.561
Our agent in 26th precinct reports
police investigation of murder

37:50.727 --> 37:53.062
<i>at the Museum
of Natural History.</i>

37:53.063 --> 37:54.105
Murder?

37:54.106 --> 37:56.191
Agent advises inquiry.

37:56.859 --> 37:58.193
Understood.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.055
I saw you as taller.

38:27.681 --> 38:28.806
Who are you?

38:28.807 --> 38:33.270
Shiwan Khan, last descendent
of Genghis Khan.

38:34.897 --> 38:37.940
You are naturally
deeply honored.

38:37.941 --> 38:40.151
Don't feel obligated
to introduce yourself.

38:40.152 --> 38:41.402
I already know who you are.

38:41.403 --> 38:44.530
<i>Not this temporary version
of yourself.</i>

38:44.531 --> 38:50.454
I know who you really are...
Ying Ko.

38:51.872 --> 38:54.416
I'm a great admirer.

38:56.084 --> 38:57.377
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:58.337 --> 39:00.254
Please.

39:00.255 --> 39:03.215
It is no more difficult for me
to invade your mind

39:03.216 --> 39:05.385
than it was this room.

39:07.429 --> 39:08.805
May I sit?

39:12.017 --> 39:13.851
You are hurting
my feelings, Ying Ko.

39:13.852 --> 39:17.271
I should have thought
you would enjoy to meet another

39:17.272 --> 39:20.651
with the unique ability
to cloud men's minds.

39:21.985 --> 39:23.653
You were a student
of the The Tulku?

39:23.654 --> 39:27.114
Yes, he spoke of you constantly.

39:27.115 --> 39:31.119
But I'm afraid he wasn't able
to turn me quite as easily.

39:32.037 --> 39:37.291
Hey, would you happen to have
some American Bourbon?

39:37.292 --> 39:39.711
I have a bit of a taste for it.

39:40.170 --> 39:42.004
<i>Hey, I'm happy to pay,
of course.</i>

39:42.005 --> 39:44.508
No, no, not at all.

39:48.720 --> 39:52.223
Say, you didn't happen,
by any chance,

39:52.224 --> 39:53.684
to, uh...

39:54.977 --> 39:58.270
pay a visit to the Museum
last night, did you?

39:58.271 --> 40:03.694
Mm, a wonderful collection
of Tibetan tapestries.

40:08.490 --> 40:09.740
<i>Ah!</i>

40:09.741 --> 40:13.829
Oh, Ying Ko, grown men
still shiver at your name.

40:15.080 --> 40:19.583
You are, I have to confess,
my idol.

40:19.584 --> 40:23.255
Your raid on the Village of Barga...
I studied it.

40:24.297 --> 40:26.632
How nice, you remember it.

40:26.633 --> 40:28.467
It rings a bell.

40:28.468 --> 40:31.512
It was a master stroke.

40:31.513 --> 40:34.516
Swift, vicious, and sudden!

40:36.518 --> 40:38.103
What genius.

40:39.021 --> 40:40.355
Uh-huh.

40:41.732 --> 40:43.775
So, uh, what brings you
to the Big Apple?

40:45.152 --> 40:47.319
My destiny.

40:47.320 --> 40:51.240
Genghis Khan conquer half
of the world in his lifetime.

40:51.241 --> 40:53.744
I intend to finish the job.

40:54.453 --> 40:56.621
And, uh, how do you plan
to do that?

40:57.456 --> 41:01.752
If I told you,
it wouldn't be a surprise.

41:02.544 --> 41:06.297
I travelled to this country
in Genghis Khan's holy crypt

41:06.298 --> 41:08.591
<i>to absorb his power.</i>

41:08.592 --> 41:13.220
In three days
the entire world will hear my roar

41:13.221 --> 41:17.601
and willingly fall subject
to the lost empire of Sianking.

41:18.977 --> 41:22.271
That is a lovely tie,
by the way.

41:22.272 --> 41:25.775
<i>- May I ask where you acquire it?
- Brooks Brothers.</i>

41:25.776 --> 41:27.193
Is that Midtown?

41:27.194 --> 41:28.944
Forty-fifth and Madison.

41:28.945 --> 41:30.947
You are a barbarian.

41:31.698 --> 41:33.532
Thank you.

41:33.533 --> 41:35.202
We both are.

41:36.161 --> 41:39.830
I know that inside you
beats a heart of darkness.

41:39.831 --> 41:43.417
You dip into it every time
you put on that hat and cloak.

41:43.418 --> 41:44.585
Join me.

41:44.586 --> 41:48.172
You are Ying Ko,
the Butcher of Lhasa.

41:48.173 --> 41:53.470
You and only you deserve
to be by my side.

41:54.429 --> 41:58.933
Together, we'll pit armies against
one another like a chess game.

41:58.934 --> 42:03.605
We'll collect our due of pain
and we'll wash our hands in blood.

42:04.147 --> 42:07.526
Your mouth still waters
at real power.

42:08.527 --> 42:11.363
I am offering you a chance
to take it back.

42:12.114 --> 42:14.407
Be my partner, Ying Ko.

42:15.826 --> 42:18.869
- That's not my name anymore.
- But it is!

42:18.870 --> 42:21.581
Nevertheless, still who you are.
Isn't it?

42:25.627 --> 42:27.419
<i>For the bourbon.</i>

42:27.420 --> 42:30.257
<i>We will meet again,</i> soon.

42:49.484 --> 42:53.028
The day of the Mongol warrior

42:53.029 --> 42:55.615
is once again at hand.

42:56.449 --> 43:00.911
Soon, with wings outstretched,

43:00.912 --> 43:04.916
we fly to our destiny!

43:08.837 --> 43:10.963
<i>Good morning,
Mr. and Mrs. America.</i>

43:10.964 --> 43:15.968
<i>Flash... Manhattan reels from yet
another report of the elusive Shadow.</i>

43:15.969 --> 43:17.803
You know, I think they just
made up the Shadow

43:17.804 --> 43:20.264
so people would listen
to the radio more.

43:20.265 --> 43:22.308
What do you think, Roy?

43:22.309 --> 43:25.019
<i>Some say
this Shadow is a foe...</i>

43:25.020 --> 43:26.354
Hm?

43:27.397 --> 43:30.816
Oh, well, it...

43:30.817 --> 43:33.028
I'll... I'll get it.

43:36.072 --> 43:37.407
Yes.

43:39.075 --> 43:40.911
The sun is shining.

43:42.537 --> 43:44.539
But the ice is slippery.

43:47.667 --> 43:49.919
You're an agent of the Shadow.

43:49.920 --> 43:51.128
Who?

43:51.129 --> 43:53.632
Oh, oh yeah, right.
Gotcha.

43:54.049 --> 43:55.883
Wh... what do you need?

43:55.884 --> 43:58.929
I need a metal analysis of this.

44:04.935 --> 44:06.311
Bronzium.

44:10.732 --> 44:12.817
The metal is bronzium.

44:13.985 --> 44:18.490
I didn't think it existed,
but, my God, here it is.

44:21.243 --> 44:23.786
The ancient Chinese believed
this was the very stuff

44:23.787 --> 44:25.914
the universe was formed of.

44:26.748 --> 44:28.540
Where did it come from?

44:28.541 --> 44:30.418
I'm told it came from Sianking.

44:31.211 --> 44:35.297
If you believed in legends,
it had to be Sianking.

44:35.298 --> 44:38.717
They called it the birthplace
of the world.

44:38.718 --> 44:42.555
Could bronzium conceivably be used
to make some sort of a weapon?

44:43.598 --> 44:46.559
Theoretically, yes.

44:47.477 --> 44:48.644
How?

44:48.645 --> 44:52.564
Well, supposedly, it's very unstable
on the molecular level,

44:52.565 --> 44:54.316
constantly given to expansion.

44:54.317 --> 44:56.235
Only the cell bonds
hold it in check.

44:56.236 --> 44:57.736
But if the bonds were
ever breached...

44:57.737 --> 44:59.488
By explosion?

44:59.489 --> 45:01.031
It wouldn't do it.

45:01.032 --> 45:04.910
But if the power of the cell
were to turn on itself in an implosion,

45:04.911 --> 45:07.079
the molecular imbalance
will be released.

45:07.080 --> 45:08.831
And then you'll have
your explosion all right.

45:08.832 --> 45:09.916
HOW big?

45:13.086 --> 45:14.629
No man can say.

45:20.302 --> 45:22.219
The breakdown
would spread to all levels

45:22.220 --> 45:25.097
of the cells'
atomic construction.

45:25.098 --> 45:27.892
Fashioned into a bomb,
it would be catastrophic.

45:29.227 --> 45:32.229
I guess you'd call it
an implosive-explosive

45:32.230 --> 45:34.606
submolecular device.

45:34.607 --> 45:36.359
Or an atomic bomb.

45:36.776 --> 45:39.446
Hey, that's catchy.

45:40.405 --> 45:44.575
But it would have to have a beryllium
sphere to contain the apparatus.

45:44.576 --> 45:46.911
No other metal would
enhance a blast.

45:47.412 --> 45:49.496
<i>In any case, it's all</i> moot.

45:49.497 --> 45:51.207
None of this would be possible.

45:52.792 --> 45:56.295
Unless some genius figures out

45:56.296 --> 45:59.049
how to design and make it.

45:59.549 --> 46:02.384
An implosive device.

46:02.385 --> 46:04.511
It would have
to be put in a shell

46:04.512 --> 46:09.601
with tiny implosive charges
regularly spread over the surface.

46:12.103 --> 46:14.314
Something like this.

46:16.441 --> 46:22.197
Fortunately,
such a device doesn't exist.

46:59.442 --> 47:04.197
Reinhardt Lane.

47:24.342 --> 47:28.805
<i>Reinhardt Lane.</i>

47:49.200 --> 47:54.122
<i>Reinhardt Lane.</i>

48:41.085 --> 48:44.839
<i>Reinhardt Lane.</i>

48:45.924 --> 48:47.717
Yes, my Khan.

48:51.638 --> 48:54.139
You know something, Lamont,
that puzzles me?

48:54.140 --> 48:58.227
How a man like yourself
who has absolutely nothing to do

48:58.228 --> 49:00.897
can be late
for every little engagement.

49:01.856 --> 49:06.026
Practice, Uncle Wainwright.
Lots and lots of practice.

49:06.027 --> 49:07.152
- Waiter?
- Mm.

49:07.153 --> 49:09.947
Get me some more chives,
would you please and, uh...

49:09.948 --> 49:12.074
Oh, my God, here comes
that Lane woman.

49:12.075 --> 49:14.076
Oh, please,
I don't need her anymore, I, oh...

49:14.077 --> 49:15.827
Hi, Miss Lane, how are you?

49:15.828 --> 49:17.913
All right, you can drop the act,
Commissioner.

49:17.914 --> 49:19.581
What have you done
about my father?

49:19.582 --> 49:22.417
<i>My secretary made it very clear.
There's nothing we can do unless...</i>

49:22.418 --> 49:24.504
Unless what?
He blows himself up?

49:26.256 --> 49:29.592
Margo Lane,
my nephew Lamont Cranston.

49:30.260 --> 49:31.843
Yes, we've met.

49:31.844 --> 49:35.014
Would you, uh, care to join us?

49:38.685 --> 49:42.271
Miss Lane, the fact that
your father is acting strangely,

49:42.272 --> 49:45.107
I don't think really calls
for a police investigation.

49:45.108 --> 49:46.316
Look, I just want to see him.

49:46.317 --> 49:49.736
The War Department says he's suddenly
decided to take no visitors,

49:49.737 --> 49:51.071
not even his own daughter.

49:51.072 --> 49:54.533
Well, chances are he's working
on some top secret.

49:54.534 --> 49:56.493
It is a government project,
you know.

49:56.494 --> 49:58.453
No, his project is harmless.

49:58.454 --> 50:01.123
Energy research...
some kind of implosive device.

50:01.124 --> 50:02.749
<i>Look, I know something's wrong.</i>

50:02.750 --> 50:04.002
<i>I spoke to him on the phone.</i>

50:04.586 --> 50:08.006
He was distant,
confused, babbling.

50:09.132 --> 50:11.551
He spoke to me in Chinese.

50:13.177 --> 50:16.180
- Uh, wai... waiter.
- He doesn't even speak Chinese!

50:16.514 --> 50:18.181
<i>I'm sorry, please.</i>

50:18.182 --> 50:22.145
Tomorrow, I'll, uh, send a policeman
over to the Federal Building.

50:22.395 --> 50:24.814
You'll see your father
and everything'll be fine, all right?

50:26.149 --> 50:27.859
What's your opinion, Mr. Cra...

50:30.903 --> 50:32.280
Excuse me.

50:32.780 --> 50:33.823
Mm?

50:37.994 --> 50:39.120
Thanks.

50:41.372 --> 50:42.457
Lamont!

50:46.628 --> 50:48.211
Wait a second, Lamont.

50:48.212 --> 50:50.131
I wanted to ask you
about my father.

50:51.841 --> 50:53.259
I have to go.

50:54.677 --> 50:56.012
Ying Ko.

50:56.638 --> 50:58.014
Who's Ying Ko?

51:00.808 --> 51:01.768
Uh!

51:02.977 --> 51:04.394
You will forget about me.

51:04.395 --> 51:05.729
Why would I do that?

51:05.730 --> 51:08.399
You will give me
no further thought.

51:09.942 --> 51:11.652
Are you drunk?

51:11.653 --> 51:13.779
Look, Mr. Cranston, I don't know
what kind of woman

51:13.780 --> 51:16.699
you're used to dealing with, but I
certainly don't appreciate being...

51:17.492 --> 51:18.784
Hey!

51:18.785 --> 51:20.410
Taxi, taxi!

51:20.411 --> 51:22.037
The Federal Building.

51:22.038 --> 51:23.164
You got it, boss.

51:55.196 --> 51:56.405
Pizza?

51:56.406 --> 51:57.824
Yechh.

51:58.741 --> 52:01.159
Well, I'm not going
to eat a burger again.

52:01.160 --> 52:03.412
I'm not asking you
to eat a burger.

52:11.879 --> 52:14.131
You like fish?

52:14.132 --> 52:15.383
How about a burger?

52:17.760 --> 52:18.761
Uh!

52:19.178 --> 52:20.263
Uh!

53:21.157 --> 53:23.785
Next time you get to be on top.

55:15.521 --> 55:17.272
Where is Khan?

55:17.273 --> 55:18.815
I will not tell you.

55:18.816 --> 55:19.859
What are you doing?

55:21.652 --> 55:23.069
Hold on or you'll die.

55:23.070 --> 55:25.281
Yes, to serve my Khan.

55:28.826 --> 55:30.578
I sense somebody's coming.

55:36.417 --> 55:39.045
- Uh.
- Wooh!

55:47.303 --> 55:48.262
Drive.

56:00.900 --> 56:02.025
Hello?

56:02.026 --> 56:04.069
- Hello, Margo.
- Oh, Dad.

56:04.070 --> 56:06.948
<i>- Are you all right?</i>
- <i>I'm</i> fine, dear.

56:07.782 --> 56:10.034
I need to see you right away.

56:11.202 --> 56:12.744
At the lab.

56:12.745 --> 56:13.871
<i>Are you there now?</i>

56:15.373 --> 56:16.874
Hurry.

56:24.382 --> 56:27.468
Oh no, no, no.

56:32.765 --> 56:34.391
Oh, God.

56:34.392 --> 56:35.685
Dad!

56:36.852 --> 56:38.813
Dad, where are you?

56:39.897 --> 56:41.357
Oh, God, no.

56:57.456 --> 57:01.961
<i>Margo Lane.</i>

57:37.246 --> 57:40.041
I have a mission for you,
my dear.

58:48.400 --> 58:49.902
Margo Lane.

58:51.320 --> 58:52.737
What are you doing here?

58:52.738 --> 58:54.405
You're in my home.

58:54.406 --> 58:55.615
I am?
Your home?

58:55.616 --> 58:57.575
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know.

58:57.576 --> 59:01.913
- Who sent you?
- I don't know.

59:01.914 --> 59:04.290
There was a voice
over and over in my head.

59:04.291 --> 59:06.252
It said I had
to kill the Shadow.

59:09.130 --> 59:10.798
I want you to leave right now.

59:12.675 --> 59:14.926
I had to kill the Shadow
and I came here.

59:14.927 --> 59:17.388
I said I want you
to leave right now.

59:18.389 --> 59:20.015
And there was only you.

59:21.350 --> 59:22.309
Get out.

59:22.726 --> 59:24.228
Let me see into your eyes.

59:27.231 --> 59:29.065
You want to see into my eyes?

59:29.066 --> 59:31.401
- I think I know something...
- Go ahead.

59:31.402 --> 59:33.486
- I didn't before.
- Look at them.

59:33.487 --> 59:36.030
- Look at them.
- There's something strange about you.

59:36.031 --> 59:38.449
- I could feel it.
- But I've got to warn you,

59:38.450 --> 59:41.119
- I could feel it.
- you won't like what you see.

59:41.120 --> 59:43.580
Static in my head
whenever I was near you.

59:43.581 --> 59:47.710
I knew it.
You're the Shadow.

59:54.717 --> 59:56.426
My father's disappeared.

59:56.427 --> 59:58.888
<i>You're the only one
who can help me find him.</i>

01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:02.766
Just be gone when I get back.

01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:09.106
How do you know I won't tell
anyone who you really are?

01:00:11.317 --> 01:00:12.693
I know.

01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:24.246
To The Sanctum.

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:22.448
Nice tie.

01:02:22.948 --> 01:02:23.991
Thank you.

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:38.921
By the way, you sent
Margo Lane to kill me.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.214
Kill you?

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:44.510
If I wanted you dead, Ying Ko,
I would have your liver on pole by now.

01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:46.179
I sent a girl to be killed.

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.473
Tell me, how did you kill her?

01:02:48.474 --> 01:02:49.807
She's alive.

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:51.309
<i>And she's a danger to you.</i>

01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:53.936
She now knows
exactly who you are.

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:55.813
How long will you let her live?

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:59.651
How long before
your pure instincts take over?

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:02.945
I'm onto your plan, Khan.

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.822
You still don't have
the beryllium sphere.

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:06.783
And without it,
you can't complete the bomb.

01:03:06.784 --> 01:03:09.744
Besides, you know
I'm going to stop you.

01:03:09.745 --> 01:03:12.831
You American are so arrogant.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:16.084
You think your meaningless,
decadent country

01:03:16.085 --> 01:03:18.669
is the new cradle
of civilization.

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:20.254
<i>- But let me tell you something.
- Hey.</i>

01:03:20.255 --> 01:03:22.507
That's the US of A
you're talking about, pal.

01:03:22.508 --> 01:03:25.135
I am talking
about ruling the world.

01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:29.305
I'd like to give you a name.

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:32.266
Leonard Levinski,
brilliant psychiatrist.

01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:34.103
- You'll talk, he'll listen.
- You are boring me!

01:03:37.398 --> 01:03:39.107
Oh, that knife.

01:03:39.108 --> 01:03:40.525
<i>Recognize it.</i>

01:03:40.526 --> 01:03:42.069
<i>I took it from The Tulku.</i>

01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:45.863
No, no, no, I correct myself.

01:03:45.864 --> 01:03:50.869
I took it out of The Tulku
after I ran it through his heart.

01:03:52.538 --> 01:03:55.915
<i>When will you learn to listen
to your instincts?</i>

01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:57.459
Instincts?

01:03:58.377 --> 01:04:00.087
I'll show you my instincts.

01:04:02.965 --> 01:04:04.758
<i>Never did master
the Phurba, did you?</i>

01:04:05.217 --> 01:04:08.095
Still expect it
to respond to brute force.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:14.977
<i>My Mongol warrior
aren't terribly bright.</i>

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.355
But they are loyal.

01:04:19.064 --> 01:04:20.606
<i>Accept the truth.</i>

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:22.900
There is no light
without shadow.

01:04:22.901 --> 01:04:24.945
And you and I are their shadow.

01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:30.158
<i>I would sooner destroy
a Rembrandt than kill you.</i>

01:04:30.159 --> 01:04:33.828
<i>For the last time,
will you join me?</i>

01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:37.498
<i>You cannot fool me.
You cannot defeat me.</i>

01:04:37.499 --> 01:04:39.208
Your mind is an open book to me.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:41.295
Then learn how to read.

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:44.046
Uh!

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:45.215
Weakling.

01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:57.394
Ka Khan!

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:16.622
Tail 'em, Moe.

01:05:28.008 --> 01:05:29.760
He's disappeared, boss.

01:05:31.345 --> 01:05:32.304
Stop the car.

01:06:31.989 --> 01:06:34.366
It's just an empty lot, boss.

01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:30.047
I can't help that I know
what I know about you.

01:07:34.843 --> 01:07:37.012
And I can't forget it either.

01:07:47.606 --> 01:07:48.982
It's late.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.904
Sleep here if you like.
There are guest rooms.

01:07:57.032 --> 01:07:58.992
But in the morning
you should go.

01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:05.666
I'm not afraid of you.

01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:18.386
But I am.

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:29.981
<i>Lamont.</i>

01:08:36.113 --> 01:08:38.156
<i>Lamont.</i>

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:46.122
<i>Lamont.</i>

01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:26.412
Oh, my God.

01:09:43.596 --> 01:09:44.848
Good morning.

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:46.975
Good morning.

01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:52.354
Oh, God, I dreamed.

01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:56.026
So did I.

01:09:56.818 --> 01:09:57.778
What did you dream?

01:09:59.154 --> 01:10:02.740
I was lying naked on the beach
in the South Seas.

01:10:02.741 --> 01:10:05.702
<i>And the tide was
coming up over my toes.</i>

01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:12.209
The sun was beating down.

01:10:13.502 --> 01:10:15.545
My skin was...

01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:19.508
hot and cool at the same time.

01:10:23.178 --> 01:10:24.805
<i>It was wonderful.</i>

01:10:28.016 --> 01:10:29.309
What was yours?

01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:32.269
I dreamed I tore
all the skin off my face

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:33.939
and was somebody else
underneath.

01:10:35.816 --> 01:10:37.025
You have problems.

01:10:38.318 --> 01:10:39.402
I'm aware of that.

01:10:41.071 --> 01:10:43.239
I'll wait for you outside
while you get dressed.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.615
Oh, that's okay.

01:10:44.616 --> 01:10:45.951
You can stay.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.162
Oh, these are all rumpled.

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:53.249
Uh, well, there might be some things
in here that you could use.

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:55.793
Uh, yeah.

01:10:55.794 --> 01:10:58.838
- This belonged to, uh, my Aunt Rose.
- Oh, really.

01:10:58.839 --> 01:11:00.422
Very fashionable gal, that Rose.

01:11:00.423 --> 01:11:03.717
- Mm-mm, kept her figure too.
- Ah, yeah.

01:11:03.718 --> 01:11:05.553
Well, I've gotta run.
I've got a, uh...

01:11:05.554 --> 01:11:06.972
<i>Taxi waiting downstairs?</i>

01:11:07.848 --> 01:11:09.014
Excuse me?

01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:10.808
Oh, I just sensed that's what
you were going to say.

01:11:10.809 --> 01:11:12.017
It is, isn't it?

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:13.352
- Yes.
- Huh!

01:11:13.353 --> 01:11:16.188
Say this is getting easier
the more I'm around you.

01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:18.190
You're like reading a book.

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:21.610
Well, thank you very much, Lamont,
but I won't be needing that taxi.

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:23.946
Whoa, yes, you do.
I have a very important...

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:24.989
Oh, great, I'll come with you.

01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:28.409
- Uh, no, last night we agreed...
- Uh, no, I didn't agree to anything.

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:31.287
Do you mind if I just get
one tiny little sentence out here?

01:11:31.288 --> 01:11:32.371
Thank you very much.

01:11:32.372 --> 01:11:34.748
Last night we both agreed that
you were going to leave this morning.

01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:37.042
No, you agreed
I was going to leave.

01:11:37.043 --> 01:11:39.712
I agreed to no such thing.
We need each other.

01:11:39.713 --> 01:11:41.547
- No we don't.
- We have a connection.

01:11:41.548 --> 01:11:42.590
No we don't.

01:11:42.591 --> 01:11:44.341
Then how do you explain that
I can read your thoughts?

01:11:44.342 --> 01:11:46.176
- My thoughts are hard to miss.
- And why is that?

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:48.012
Psychically,
I'm very well endowed.

01:11:48.013 --> 01:11:50.306
I'll bet you are.

01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:52.892
Okay, so you don't need me,

01:11:52.893 --> 01:11:56.354
but I need you, Lamont,
to help me find my father.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:12:00.567
And I am coming with you.

01:12:01.735 --> 01:12:02.986
Okay.

01:12:04.195 --> 01:12:06.113
<i>Empire State Building pennants.</i>

01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:08.115
<i>Get your Empire State
Building pennants.</i>

01:12:08.116 --> 01:12:12.119
From there to there.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.371
That is just the explosion.

01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:18.585
The destruction
will be incalculable.

01:12:20.462 --> 01:12:21.712
Good.

01:12:21.713 --> 01:12:25.633
Ahh, what a beautiful day.

01:12:25.634 --> 01:12:28.511
Nice dress, toots.

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:59.875
- Come on along and listen to...
- Get me <i>down!</i>

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:01.627
Hey, Bobby, what the hell
are you doing?

01:13:01.628 --> 01:13:03.128
- I have no idea.
- No, don't do it.

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:04.172
Get me down.

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:06.298
Get me down from here.

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:09.218
The lullaby of Broadway.

01:13:09.219 --> 01:13:12.055
Get me down.
Get me down!

01:13:14.808 --> 01:13:17.351
<i>It's all falling
into place for me now.</i>

01:13:17.352 --> 01:13:20.230
Shiwan Khan needs a beryllium sphere
to complete the bomb.

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:23.440
I wonder where
he intends to find one.

01:13:23.441 --> 01:13:25.734
Beryllium sphere?
Beryllium sphere?

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:27.820
- Farley Claymore.
- What's that?

01:13:27.821 --> 01:13:30.114
Farley Claymore,
my father's assistant.

01:13:30.115 --> 01:13:32.282
He was working on a beryllium sphere,
I'm sure of it.

01:13:32.283 --> 01:13:35.035
- In your father's lab?
- No, no, he was working on his own.

01:13:35.036 --> 01:13:37.371
- Uh, Maritech Labs down on Southside.
- Good, very good.

01:13:37.372 --> 01:13:39.832
Do your sleeping at home, will ya?
Get out of the way!

01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:41.250
Hey, I got something else
I want you to do for me.

01:13:41.251 --> 01:13:42.376
Of course, what?

01:13:42.377 --> 01:13:43.919
I was trailing Khan when
I suddenly lost him

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.921
on the corner of Second Avenue
and Houston Street.

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.589
There's something very strange
about that corner.

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:50.259
It's a vacant lot now, but I want
you to find out what used to be there.

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:51.635
Second and Houston.

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:53.512
What about Farley Claymore?

01:13:53.513 --> 01:13:56.390
Mr. Claymore's gonna
receive a little visit

01:13:56.391 --> 01:13:57.809
from the Shadow.

01:14:12.282 --> 01:14:14.033
<i>Farley Claymore.</i>

01:14:14.034 --> 01:14:15.743
Who's that?

01:14:15.744 --> 01:14:18.370
<i>Where is the beryllium sphere,
Claymore?</i>

01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:19.497
sphere?

01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:23.042
What sphere?

01:14:23.043 --> 01:14:26.003
<i>Claymore, you idiot!</i>

01:14:26.004 --> 01:14:28.088
<i>You're being manipulated.</i>

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:31.592
<i>Your mind is being controlled
by hypnosis.</i>

01:14:31.593 --> 01:14:33.635
My mind?

01:14:33.636 --> 01:14:35.012
Controlled?

01:14:35.013 --> 01:14:37.431
<i>Claymore, what have you done
with the sphere?</i>

01:14:37.432 --> 01:14:40.601
It's too late.
I loaded it on a truck.

01:14:40.602 --> 01:14:42.228
<i>Take me to it now!</i>

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:56.993
<i>Who do you think you're gonna shoot
with that, Claymore?</i>

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:04.751
<i>Uh!</i>

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:13.675
No one controls my mind, Shadow!

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:16.386
There's a new
world order coming.

01:15:16.387 --> 01:15:18.597
And I'm gonna be a king.

01:15:18.598 --> 01:15:20.016
A king!

01:16:24.664 --> 01:16:25.832
<i>Margo.</i>

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:30.127
<i>Margo, I need you.</i>

01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:05.014
You called?

01:18:14.065 --> 01:18:15.233
Lamont?

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.551
You are not supposed to be here.

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:08.328
<i>Lamont?</i>

01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:10.705
Lamont.

01:19:18.212 --> 01:19:19.547
You were dreaming.

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:28.306
You saw.

01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:37.190
Do you have any idea

01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:40.525
what it's like
to have done things

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:43.237
you can never
forgive yourself for?

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:49.911
Lamont...

01:19:54.207 --> 01:19:56.084
whoever you were,

01:19:57.251 --> 01:19:59.045
whatever you did...

01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:03.674
it's in the past.

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:07.845
Not for me, Margo.

01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:11.808
Never for me.

01:20:18.606 --> 01:20:21.526
We are victorious.

01:20:22.902 --> 01:20:27.865
And as victors, we will collect
the spoils of war.

01:20:28.658 --> 01:20:31.327
I will remember each of you.

01:20:32.662 --> 01:20:36.289
Particularly my special servant.

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:39.418
The only American
with genius enough

01:20:39.419 --> 01:20:42.754
to join me of his own free will.

01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:44.674
Khan.

01:20:47.051 --> 01:20:51.346
Who saw himself
a king in my kingdom.

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:54.434
King?
Did Is ay king?

01:20:55.685 --> 01:20:57.894
Maybe not the best
choice of words.

01:20:57.895 --> 01:20:59.938
No, it wasn't.

01:20:59.939 --> 01:21:02.108
Because actually
I was thinking prince, tops.

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:06.779
Not even necessarily.
Uh, duke, baron?

01:21:07.655 --> 01:21:09.365
You're choice, of course.
Your choice.

01:21:11.576 --> 01:21:13.743
Get Dr. Lane.
Assemble the bomb!

01:21:13.744 --> 01:21:14.786
Of course.

01:21:14.787 --> 01:21:17.331
In the name of the new Kha Khan.

01:21:18.458 --> 01:21:21.334
The power of God on Earth.

01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:25.131
The Emperor of Mankind.

01:21:38.102 --> 01:21:40.812
Extra, extra, read all about it.

01:21:40.813 --> 01:21:43.274
Madman threatens
to blow the city sky-high.

01:21:46.194 --> 01:21:49.613
Residents of New York City were
thrown into a virtual panic today.

01:21:49.614 --> 01:21:53.366
<i>Police were still trying to determine
if, in fact, the threat was real</i>

01:21:53.367 --> 01:21:55.410
<i>or merely an incredible hoax.</i>

01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:58.247
Either way,
surely the work of a madman.

01:22:08.007 --> 01:22:09.175
Morning, Russell.

01:22:14.305 --> 01:22:19.227
He's demanded works of art,
famous jewels, even gold.

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:23.480
Find Khan and you'll find
the bomb, I bet.

01:22:23.481 --> 01:22:25.482
What did you find out
about that vacant lot?

01:22:25.483 --> 01:22:26.816
Not much, I'm afraid.

01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:29.027
It was the site
of the old Hotel Monolith.

01:22:29.028 --> 01:22:32.531
It was finished nearly ten years ago,
but it never opened.

01:22:32.532 --> 01:22:35.784
The Monolith.
I vaguely remember that.

01:22:35.785 --> 01:22:38.703
Seems that's the only way
anybody remembers it.

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:40.747
Before the hotel was completed,

01:22:40.748 --> 01:22:44.501
the developer went bankrupt
and committed suicide.

01:22:44.502 --> 01:22:46.211
Ah.

01:22:46.212 --> 01:22:51.216
The, uh, last record is a sale
to a Far Eastern buyer

01:22:51.217 --> 01:22:52.510
six years ago.

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:54.553
When was it torn down?

01:22:54.554 --> 01:22:55.887
It doesn't say.

01:22:55.888 --> 01:22:59.307
I made some calls this morning
to newspapers and such.

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:03.061
All anybody can remember is
up to the time it was sold.

01:23:03.062 --> 01:23:05.605
Everyone seems
to know that it was torn down,

01:23:05.606 --> 01:23:10.026
but they can't remember
when or by whom.

01:23:10.027 --> 01:23:11.571
Or if.

01:23:30.298 --> 01:23:31.924
I can't believe he did it.

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:34.092
Did what?

01:23:34.093 --> 01:23:35.052
Lamont?

01:23:36.012 --> 01:23:38.014
My God.

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:56.991
It's beautiful.

01:23:57.742 --> 01:23:58.868
What is?

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.411
Hey, hey, fella.

01:24:01.412 --> 01:24:03.456
That building right there,
what's the name of that building?

01:24:04.999 --> 01:24:06.625
<i>Lunatic.</i>

01:24:06.626 --> 01:24:11.088
Shiwan Khan has
hypnotized the entire city!

01:24:15.593 --> 01:24:16.844
They don't see it.

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:22.475
None of them see it.

01:24:25.269 --> 01:24:26.729
But I see it.

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:30.690
You and Shrevnitz
will receive your instructions.

01:24:30.691 --> 01:24:32.776
I want you
to follow them exactly.

01:24:32.777 --> 01:24:33.736
Lamont.

01:24:43.079 --> 01:24:46.498
Bet you wish you'd been a little nicer
to me now, huh, don't ya?

01:24:46.499 --> 01:24:49.668
Bet you wish you'd listened
to my ideas?

01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:51.670
Bet you didn't count
on me being friends

01:24:51.671 --> 01:24:53.380
with a conqueror,
huh, did ya, did ya?

01:24:53.381 --> 01:24:55.715
Hey, that's enough.

01:24:55.716 --> 01:24:57.259
Activate the bomb.

01:25:04.809 --> 01:25:07.144
Set the timer for two hours.

01:25:15.736 --> 01:25:17.987
You are certain
you could duplicate

01:25:17.988 --> 01:25:20.490
this bomb's design
any time I require?

01:25:20.491 --> 01:25:22.284
Absolutely, no problem.

01:25:23.327 --> 01:25:25.912
That makes Dr. Lane obsolete.

01:25:25.913 --> 01:25:27.747
Secure him in a room.

01:25:27.748 --> 01:25:30.625
He'll die at the hands
of his own invention.

01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:32.336
Yes, my Khan.

01:25:33.003 --> 01:25:36.256
Listen, I know
you must have this covered,

01:25:36.257 --> 01:25:39.050
but shouldn't we be
getting out of here too?

01:25:39.051 --> 01:25:42.512
There's an aeroplane waiting
to take us all to safety.

01:25:42.513 --> 01:25:43.931
<i>We leave in one hour.</i>

01:26:31.937 --> 01:26:33.439
What is it, Moe?

01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:39.736
<i>Is it another one of those things
from the bowling league?</i>

01:26:39.737 --> 01:26:40.946
Mm-hm.

01:27:06.305 --> 01:27:07.848
" Uh!
" Uh!

01:27:45.678 --> 01:27:47.054
Ying Ko.

01:27:48.138 --> 01:27:49.597
The Shadow.

01:27:49.598 --> 01:27:50.807
Where?

01:27:50.808 --> 01:27:53.977
Not here, you idiot.
In the building.

01:27:53.978 --> 01:27:55.771
Can you tell if he's mad at me?

01:27:56.939 --> 01:27:59.774
We had a little
misunderstanding yesterday

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:02.528
and there might
still be hard feelings.

01:28:04.363 --> 01:28:06.115
Find him and kill him!

01:28:06.615 --> 01:28:07.866
Kill him?

01:28:07.867 --> 01:28:09.743
- Me?
- All of you!

01:28:12.746 --> 01:28:15.623
Couldn't I just stay here
and help you?

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:16.584
Go!

01:28:35.519 --> 01:28:37.438
You guys go that way.

01:29:12.097 --> 01:29:15.558
<i>Did you think you'd
never see me again, Claymore?</i>

01:29:19.438 --> 01:29:20.648
<i>I'm right here.</i>

01:29:24.193 --> 01:29:26.403
<i>All around you.</i>

01:29:27.821 --> 01:29:30.074
<i>Everywhere around you.</i>

01:29:48.425 --> 01:29:50.803
Coward!

01:29:51.929 --> 01:29:54.473
Chicken, sissy!

01:29:55.516 --> 01:29:58.727
Come out here
and fight like a man!

01:30:29.466 --> 01:30:31.552
You're a fool, Claymore.

01:30:33.429 --> 01:30:35.222
Get out of my sight!

01:30:45.232 --> 01:30:47.359
<i>There's your exit, Claymore.</i>

01:31:05.627 --> 01:31:07.796
You know what I love
about this job?

01:31:09.089 --> 01:31:10.632
The excitement.

01:31:21.769 --> 01:31:24.270
Ah, Ying Ko, I surrender.

01:31:24.271 --> 01:31:26.315
You're finished, Khan.

01:31:47.586 --> 01:31:48.587
Uh!

01:31:54.134 --> 01:31:55.427
Phurba.

01:32:23.664 --> 01:32:26.415
<i>You are losing
your concentration.</i>

01:32:26.416 --> 01:32:29.627
<i>Your mind is too weak.</i>

01:32:29.628 --> 01:32:32.797
<i>You are beginning
to lose your power.</i>

01:32:51.733 --> 01:32:53.026
Look at you.

01:32:54.153 --> 01:32:56.279
Can't even control yourself.

01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:58.240
<i>How can you hope
to control Phurba?</i>

01:33:29.479 --> 01:33:30.856
Stop!

01:33:45.787 --> 01:33:47.371
My God.

01:33:47.372 --> 01:33:49.166
That's what he saw.

01:33:57.424 --> 01:33:58.717
Mm.

01:34:00.385 --> 01:34:01.345
Where am I?

01:34:07.059 --> 01:34:09.269
Ka Khan!

01:34:48.308 --> 01:34:49.476
Khan!

01:35:04.741 --> 01:35:06.659
- Dad.
- Margo.

01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:09.829
- Oh, are you all right?
- Where am I?

01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:11.539
What is going on here?

01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:14.667
- Well, there's this guy...
- Mm-hm.

01:35:14.668 --> 01:35:16.127
I'll tell you later.

01:35:16.128 --> 01:35:17.337
- Moe, go call the police.
- Okay.

01:35:28.932 --> 01:35:30.850
<i>Look, there it is.</i>

01:35:30.851 --> 01:35:32.601
Oh, my God!

01:35:32.602 --> 01:35:35.104
Oh, this is impressive work.

01:35:35.105 --> 01:35:36.897
Who did this?

01:35:36.898 --> 01:35:40.152
You did.
We only have an hour left.

01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:41.570
Disconnect it.

01:35:48.201 --> 01:35:50.203
Hm, cut this off.

01:35:50.746 --> 01:35:51.871
Oh.

01:35:51.872 --> 01:35:53.998
Dad, the timer...
You gotta stop it.

01:35:53.999 --> 01:35:55.375
Oh dear.

01:35:56.293 --> 01:35:57.461
Hah!

01:36:01.256 --> 01:36:02.674
<i>Two minutes left.</i>

01:36:14.895 --> 01:36:17.064
Oh, my God, hurry.
Hurry, Dad.

01:36:22.277 --> 01:36:23.403
This way.

01:36:29.242 --> 01:36:31.453
Oh, my God, it's upstairs.

01:36:41.713 --> 01:36:43.256
<i>Oh, no, the elevator!</i>

01:36:52.974 --> 01:36:54.267
Be careful.

01:37:08.365 --> 01:37:09.698
Which wire?

01:37:09.699 --> 01:37:11.617
I don't remember.
I just don't remember.

01:37:11.618 --> 01:37:12.744
Pick one!

01:37:14.079 --> 01:37:16.748
Oh, well, what the hell,
it's usually green.

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:20.293
No, green!

01:37:22.129 --> 01:37:23.213
This is green.

01:37:24.297 --> 01:37:25.673
That's red.

01:37:25.674 --> 01:37:27.675
I've gotta try to remember that.

01:37:27.676 --> 01:37:28.844
Oh.

01:37:41.022 --> 01:37:42.231
What are you doing?

01:38:32.699 --> 01:38:35.285
<i>Where the hell
did that come from?</i>

01:38:55.722 --> 01:38:57.015
What is this?

01:39:01.269 --> 01:39:03.480
Where am I, huh?

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:07.484
You, come here.

01:39:09.444 --> 01:39:10.529
Look at me.

01:39:16.284 --> 01:39:18.328
Look into my eyes.

01:39:21.915 --> 01:39:23.792
Yes.

01:39:25.585 --> 01:39:27.003
Release me at once.

01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:31.632
No, we won't have
any of that, Mr. Khan.

01:39:31.633 --> 01:39:33.760
Let's just have a look
at those stitches, shall we?

01:39:34.052 --> 01:39:35.970
Stitches.

01:39:35.971 --> 01:39:37.763
What... what have you done?

01:39:37.764 --> 01:39:39.515
Saved your life, that's what.

01:39:39.516 --> 01:39:42.142
Of course, we had to remove
a little section of your frontal lobe.

01:39:42.143 --> 01:39:43.852
But you'll never miss it,
believe me.

01:39:43.853 --> 01:39:45.521
It's a part nobody ever uses.

01:39:45.522 --> 01:39:46.690
But... huh?

01:39:48.441 --> 01:39:51.277
Unless you believe
in telepathy.

01:39:51.278 --> 01:39:52.821
Wait!
Come back here!

01:39:53.530 --> 01:39:55.115
You, come here!

01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:59.702
I am Shiwan Khan, the last
descendant of Genghis Khan!

01:39:59.703 --> 01:40:01.245
Listen to me!

01:40:01.246 --> 01:40:02.746
<i>I'm Houdini!</i>

01:40:02.747 --> 01:40:04.707
I am Theodore Roosevelt.

01:40:04.708 --> 01:40:06.333
I am Napoleon.

01:40:06.334 --> 01:40:08.085
<i>I'm Josephine.</i>

01:40:08.086 --> 01:40:09.878
<i>I'm Babe Ruth.</i>

01:40:28.648 --> 01:40:29.858
I'll see you later.

01:40:34.696 --> 01:40:36.906
Hey, how will you know
where I am?

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:41.536
I'll know.
