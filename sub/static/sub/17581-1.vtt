LEONARDO DICAPRIO: My first
visual memories are of this

00:35.065 --> 00:38.469
framed poster above my crib.

00:43.341 --> 00:46.244
I would stare at it every

00:51.048 --> 00:54.285
My father was an underground
comic distributor.

He's always been this sort of
Zelig of the counterculture

The Garden of Earthly Delights

it starts to become

their way into the painting.

there's debauchery and excess.

14:31.035 --> 14:33.037
Not light blue like this, blue.

14:33.070 --> 14:34.805
Hard, ice.

14:34.839 --> 14:42.713
Now we usually have a, kind
of ice cream type of ice.

14:42.747 --> 14:44.982
It's ice but it's,
when it starts to melt,

14:45.015 --> 14:46.884
it melts pretty fast.

14:46.917 --> 14:49.119
Much faster than before.

14:49.153 --> 14:54.925
DR. SALA: 2040, you will be able
to sail over the North Pole.

14:54.959 --> 14:57.995
There's going to be no sea
ice left in the Arctic Ocean

14:58.028 --> 14:59.797
in the summer.

14:59.830 --> 15:03.168
We are burning so many fossil
fuels that the ice is melting.

15:06.237 --> 15:09.274
The Arctic is like
the air conditioning for

15:09.307 --> 15:11.376
the Northern Hemisphere.

15:11.409 --> 15:14.679
If it goes away, that's
going to change currents,

15:14.712 --> 15:17.047
that's going to change
weather patterns,

15:17.081 --> 15:21.852
that's going to make floods and
droughts more catastrophic.

15:21.886 --> 15:25.723
It's the most dramatic
transformation of a large

15:25.756 --> 15:26.991

15:48.746 --> 15:50.648
That's awesome.

15:50.681 --> 15:53.984
DR. SALA: Yeah, they are
waiting for the ice to open up,

15:54.018 --> 15:57.021

can catch the flounder.

16:23.113 --> 16:26.184
I remember being asked to
participate in this huge event

16:26.217 --> 16:27.985
in Washington for Earth Day.

16:28.018 --> 16:30.955
Temperatures are rising,
coral reefs are dying,

16:30.988 --> 16:34.392
and not since a meteor hit the
earth 65 million years ago,

16:34.425 --> 16:37.061
have so many species of plant
and animals become extinct

16:37.094 --> 16:38.329
in such a short time.

16:38.363 --> 16:40.198
I even got a chance to
interview the President

16:40.231 --> 16:41.866
of the United States.

16:41.899 --> 16:44.369
Why do you think this issue
is so constantly overlooked?

16:44.402 --> 16:46.971
BILL CLINTON: I think it's
because it takes a long time

16:47.004 --> 16:49.474
for the climate to change in
a way that people feel it,

16:49.507 --> 16:53.878
and because, uh, it seems
sort of abstract now.

16:53.911 --> 16:56.247
DICAPRIO: At the time, it was
this huge push to get the word

16:56.281 --> 16:57.948
out on global warming.

16:57.982 --> 17:00.117
Now a couple degrees' difference
in today's temperatures

17:00.150 --> 17:02.820
may not seem like an emergency.

17:02.853 --> 17:07.090
Back then everyone was focused
on small, individual actions.

17:07.124 --> 17:10.194
We all have to, you know, bring
environmentalism to the American

17:10.228 --> 17:11.796
consciousness.

17:11.829 --> 17:13.998
And it boiled down to simple
solutions like changing

17:14.031 --> 17:16.934
your light bulb.

17:16.967 --> 17:20.104
It seemed like a positive
thing at the time, you know.

17:20.137 --> 17:21.839
Changing your lightbulb.

17:24.008 --> 17:27.212
But it's pretty clear that we're
way beyond that point now;

17:27.244 --> 17:30.014
things have taken a
massive turn for the worst.

17:33.451 --> 17:36.086

aren't in the climate models

17:36.120 --> 17:38.055

project the future.

17:38.088 --> 17:42.026
So that, that tells me that the
projections for the future are,

17:42.059 --> 17:44.829
are really conservative.

17:44.862 --> 17:47.232
If climate stays at this
temperature that it's been

17:47.265 --> 17:50.835

making its way to the sea.

18:08.353 --> 18:11.389
If that's not balanced by
snowfall then the ice sheet gets

18:11.422 --> 18:13.358
smaller and sea level rises.

18:16.827 --> 18:19.530
This is actually our
proper climate station.

18:19.564 --> 18:23.100
DICAPRIO: This is
a climate station?

18:23.133 --> 18:26.537

with all kinds of scientists

18:26.571 --> 18:28.138

18:28.173 --> 18:33.278
It really does look like
broken down pool equipment.

18:33.311 --> 18:35.180
How, what does this connect to?

18:35.213 --> 18:37.014
BOX: Well, this is
all melted up now,

18:37.047 --> 18:39.584
this was a hose that
went down 30 feet,

18:39.617 --> 18:41.386
and now it's melted out.

18:41.419 --> 18:43.020

minute, so this,

18:43.053 --> 18:45.990

be straight down under ice?

18:46.023 --> 18:47.458
BOX: Yeah, so we made.

18:47.492 --> 18:49.594

of ice that has melted.

18:49.627 --> 18:51.095

19:07.512 --> 19:09.414
This is 5 years of melt.

is the thickness of ice that has

19:14.452 --> 19:18.523
melted throughout all of lower
Greenland in the past 5 years.

19:18.556 --> 19:20.124
BOX: Right.

19:20.157 --> 19:23.294
That's hundreds of cubic
kilometers of ice that's now

19:23.328 --> 19:25.396

solar and batteries is that

57:59.477 --> 58:02.213
you can avoid building
electricity plants at all.

58:02.247 --> 58:05.350
So you could be in a remote

then supplies power to the,

the landline phones, they just
went straight to cellular.

58:54.031 --> 58:55.933
The Gigafactory,
when it's complete,

of any building in the world.

58:59.970 --> 59:01.939

could be as much as 15 million

59:01.972 --> 59:04.909

So, Tesla can't build
100 gigafactories.

59:08.979 --> 59:10.848
The thing that's really gonna
make a difference is if

59:10.881 --> 59:13.684
companies that are much bigger
than Tesla do the same thing.

59:13.718 --> 59:17.622
If the big industrial companies
in China, and U. S., and Europe,

59:17.655 --> 59:20.491
the big car companies,
if they also do this,

then collectively we can
accelerate the transition

59:23.494 --> 59:24.995

59:27.898 --> 59:30.901
we can get there really quickly.

59:30.935 --> 59:32.337

MUSK: Yeah.

59:39.777 --> 59:42.947
And the only way to do that is
basically with a carbon tax.

59:42.980 --> 59:45.916
DICAPRIO: Okay, now walk
me through a carbon tax,

59:45.950 --> 59:47.952
which is what you're saying,
is the silver bullet

59:47.985 --> 59:49.620
for climate change.

59:49.654 --> 59:51.989
MANKIW: Well the carbon tax
would be basically a tax on

59:52.022 --> 59:54.992
any kind of activity that put
carbon into the atmosphere.

59:57.094 --> 59:59.063
So when you tax something,
you raise the price,

59:59.096 --> 01:00:01.299
people are gonna tend
to consume less of it.

01:00:01.332 --> 01:00:03.534
In fact that's sort of lesson
number one of economics.

01:00:03.568 --> 01:00:05.503
DICAPRIO: So you're teaching
economics at Harvard,

01:00:05.536 --> 01:00:08.339
and you literally wrote the
book on contemporary economics,

01:00:08.373 --> 01:00:09.840
right?

01:00:09.874 --> 01:00:10.908
MANKIW: Well if I'm teaching
the course for many years,

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:12.142
I might as well write the
textbook to go with it.

01:00:12.177 --> 01:00:14.745
DICAPRIO: So just to be clear,
you've worked with a lot of

01:00:14.779 --> 01:00:18.816
Republican heavyweights,
John McCain, Mitt Romney,

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:21.586
and you worked for George Bush
when he became president.

MANKIW: I was chairman of the
council of economic advisors.

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:27.325
DICAPRIO: So how come we don't
have a carbon tax already?

01:00:27.358 --> 01:00:28.426
MANKIW: Politicians don't
always do what professors

01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:29.527
want them to do.

[Cigarette ad].

01:00:31.896 --> 01:00:34.064
MANKIW: So the basic idea is
that we wanna tax bad activities

01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:37.902
that have negative side effects
on other people in society.

01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:39.904
So we'd raise the price of
cigarettes by putting a tax

01:00:39.937 --> 01:00:43.408
on cigarettes, people are
gonna consume fewer cigarettes.

01:00:43.441 --> 01:00:45.976
Climate change involves a
variety of negative side effects

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:47.345
and costs.

01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:56.554
A carbon tax forces people to
take account of those costs.

01:00:56.587 --> 01:01:00.425
I think trying to appeal to
people's social responsibility

01:01:00.458 --> 01:01:02.860
is really very, very hard,
because people have complicated

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:04.695
lives and they have lots
of things to worry about,

01:01:04.729 --> 01:01:06.531
they don't want to have to
think about climate change

01:01:06.564 --> 01:01:08.065
every time they do every
decision. They can't.

01:01:10.601 --> 01:01:12.437

car, are you supposed to think,

01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:13.938
Uh oh, what am I
doing to the climate?

01:01:16.707 --> 01:01:19.109
What the carbon tax does is it
nudges them in the direction

01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:20.878
of doing the right thing.

01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:21.846

get this straight.

01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:25.716
You're a Republican,
who wants more taxes?

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:27.385
MANKIW: Well, one of the
important things to keep in mind

01:01:27.418 --> 01:01:29.086
is that if you
have a carbon tax,

01:01:29.119 --> 01:01:31.956
you can turn around and cut
other taxes in response.

01:01:31.989 --> 01:01:34.692
For example, payroll taxes.

01:01:34.725 --> 01:01:37.462
This is a tax shift rather
than a tax increase.

01:01:37.495 --> 01:01:40.164
DICAPRIO: So is it possible to
ever pass a carbon tax now,

01:01:40.198 --> 01:01:43.000
given the current
political situation?

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:44.869

warms the planet even more,

of the world's population

01:14:07.545 --> 01:14:09.714
lives near oceans.
DICAPRIO: Mhm.

01:14:09.747 --> 01:14:16.387
PRES. OBAMA: If they start
moving, then you start seeing,

01:14:16.421 --> 01:14:18.889
um, scarce resources.

01:14:18.923 --> 01:14:21.826
The subject of competition
between populations.

01:14:21.859 --> 01:14:24.395
This is the reason why
the Pentagon has said,

01:14:24.429 --> 01:14:26.197
this is a national
security issue.

01:14:26.231 --> 01:14:28.165
This isn't just an
environmental issue.

01:14:28.199 --> 01:14:30.468
This is a national
security issue.

01:14:30.501 --> 01:14:36.374
You know, in addition to just
the sadness that I would feel if

01:14:36.407 --> 01:14:40.545
my kids can never see a glacier,
the way I saw when I went up

01:14:40.578 --> 01:14:43.648
to Alaska, uh, you know,
that's the romantic side of it.

01:14:43.681 --> 01:14:46.517
That's the side that takes
a walk with my daughters

01:14:46.551 --> 01:14:49.320
and I wanna be able to, them
to see, or my grandkids,

01:14:49.354 --> 01:14:50.788
I want them to see the
same things as I saw

01:14:50.821 --> 01:14:51.956
as I was growing up.

01:14:51.989 --> 01:14:55.760
Even if you were
unsentimental about that,

01:14:55.793 --> 01:14:58.863
in very hard‐headed terms,
you've gotta worry about

01:14:58.896 --> 01:15:00.731
the national security
implications of this,

01:15:00.765 --> 01:15:04.935
and the capacity for the
existing world order

01:15:04.969 --> 01:15:07.938
as we understand it to
survive the kinds of strains

01:15:07.972 --> 01:15:10.375
that the scientists are
predicting without action.

01:15:10.408 --> 01:15:14.345
This is why we have
to take action now.

01:15:14.379 --> 01:15:17.515
If we keep pushing keep prodding
and most importantly keep

01:15:17.548 --> 01:15:21.352
educating the public
there's no reason why, uh,

01:15:21.386 --> 01:15:24.255
we can't solve this
problem in time.

01:15:24.289 --> 01:15:25.390
DICAPRIO: Thank you for
your time, Mr. President.

01:15:25.423 --> 01:15:26.291
PRES. OBAMA: You bet.

01:15:26.324 --> 01:15:27.492
Thanks for the good
work you're doing.

01:15:27.525 --> 01:15:28.693
DICAPRIO: Thank you so much.
PRES. OBAMA: Alright. Good?

01:15:37.368 --> 01:15:40.838
SELLERS: I have realized that as
a science community we have not

01:15:40.871 --> 01:15:46.311
done the best job, frankly,
of communicating this threat

01:15:46.344 --> 01:15:49.680
to the public.

01:15:49.714 --> 01:15:52.717
But when you go up there and
see it with your own eye,

01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:57.688
how thin the world's
atmosphere is,

01:15:57.722 --> 01:16:01.859
tiny little onion
skin around the earth.

01:16:01.892 --> 01:16:04.795
That's all the oxygen that
we breathe, that's the CO2,

01:16:04.829 --> 01:16:07.565
everything we burn goes into it.

01:16:07.598 --> 01:16:10.868
It's an astonishingly
fragile film.

01:16:14.572 --> 01:16:17.007
You know, I knew intellectually
how the earth's system works,

01:16:17.041 --> 01:16:18.943
'cause that's what I've
been doing for 20 years.

01:16:18.976 --> 01:16:21.279
To see how the
atmosphere and the ocean,

01:16:21.312 --> 01:16:23.614
all the elements in the
system work together.

01:16:23.648 --> 01:16:24.949
So I understood it
intellectually.

01:16:24.982 --> 01:16:26.851
DICAPRIO: Mhm.

01:16:26.884 --> 01:16:29.520
SELLERS: But it's like being
an ant trying to understand

01:16:29.554 --> 01:16:32.022
what an elephant looks like by
crawling all over the elephant.

01:16:35.826 --> 01:16:36.894
But when you're
up there in orbit,

01:16:36.927 --> 01:16:41.366
and you can see 1200 miles
in any direction, I mean,

01:16:41.399 --> 01:16:42.367
let me tell you.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:45.035
It's kind of a revelation.

01:16:45.069 --> 01:16:48.373
Seeing all the cities at night,
millions of people all working

01:16:48.406 --> 01:16:50.708
away, doing something.

01:16:50.741 --> 01:16:51.942
Come around the day
side of the world,

01:16:51.976 --> 01:16:53.644
seeing the natural systems.

01:16:53.678 --> 01:16:57.315
The hurricanes, huge,
great big wheels, you know,

01:16:57.348 --> 01:16:59.550
over the oceans.

01:16:59.584 --> 01:17:02.620
Saw the Amazon River
go between my feet.

01:17:02.653 --> 01:17:04.989
For like five minutes, you know,
I have a whole green carpet

01:17:05.022 --> 01:17:05.990
either side.

01:17:06.023 --> 01:17:08.893
Just beautiful, all
the way out to the sea.

01:17:08.926 --> 01:17:10.828
And you know there was the sun
coming up over the Amazon,

01:17:10.861 --> 01:17:14.332
the whole forest waking up, and
doing what it does every day,

01:17:14.365 --> 01:17:16.567
you know. Breathing
in and breathing out.

01:17:16.601 --> 01:17:20.338
So I, I, you know, at the end
of all that I became immensely

01:17:20.371 --> 01:17:23.341
fond, more fond of
the planet. You know?

01:17:23.374 --> 01:17:24.642
Which I never thought about
when I actually just live

01:17:24.675 --> 01:17:25.676
on the surface.

01:17:25.710 --> 01:17:28.413
I'm also kind of fond of
the people on there, too.

01:17:28.446 --> 01:17:31.482
It's like being taken away from
your family and coming back.

01:17:31.516 --> 01:17:36.687
And um, you know,
I wish it all well.

01:17:36.721 --> 01:17:40.024
I, uh, just before Christmas
I got told I got pancreatic

01:17:40.057 --> 01:17:41.892
cancer.

01:17:41.926 --> 01:17:45.930
Stage 4, so it's also elsewhere
in me, not just in one place.

01:17:45.963 --> 01:17:48.433
So um, you know, the, the odds
are I won't be around

01:17:48.466 --> 01:17:50.067
for very long.

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:53.671
You know, it's a very
small chance of survival.

01:17:53.704 --> 01:17:57.608
So, uh, that's really
motivated me to think about

01:17:57.642 --> 01:18:01.045
what's important to do, and what
can I contribute in the time

01:18:01.078 --> 01:18:03.681
I have left.

01:18:03.714 --> 01:18:08.819
So this is a model
simulation of the earth, now,

01:18:08.853 --> 01:18:11.422
we have about 20 satellites
that are dedicated to looking

01:18:11.456 --> 01:18:13.891
at the earth, every day.

01:18:13.924 --> 01:18:16.561
One looks at clouds, one looks
at the sea surface temperature,

01:18:16.594 --> 01:18:19.029
Oko looks at carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere.

01:18:19.063 --> 01:18:22.567
All this information comes in,
and this is the tool we use

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.435
to do climate simulation.

01:18:24.469 --> 01:18:27.405
Here's an example of one thing
we could see: this is

01:18:27.438 --> 01:18:30.608
ocean surface temperature,
as measured from space.

01:18:30.641 --> 01:18:33.110
This is the whole world's
surface temperature.

01:18:33.143 --> 01:18:36.881
You can see the
poles melting, there.

01:18:36.914 --> 01:18:37.782
DICAPRIO: Wow.

01:18:37.815 --> 01:18:38.649
SELLERS: Yeah.
DICAPRIO: It's amazing.

01:18:38.683 --> 01:18:39.650
SELLERS: This is the
way to do it man.

01:18:39.684 --> 01:18:42.086
This is the way to really
see what's going on.

01:18:42.119 --> 01:18:43.488
Here's the Gulf
Stream, look at this.

01:18:43.521 --> 01:18:46.023
It's like a motion of the ocean.

01:18:46.056 --> 01:18:47.992
DICAPRIO: This is like
a great piece of art.

01:18:48.025 --> 01:18:49.894
SELLERS: It is, isn't it?

01:18:49.927 --> 01:18:51.462
Biggest impact would be here.

01:18:51.496 --> 01:18:53.030
DICAPRIO: In the Gulf Stream.
SELLERS: Yeah.

01:18:53.063 --> 01:18:54.999
This current here, see it?

01:18:55.032 --> 01:18:57.602
The dumping of ice
off melting Greenland,

01:18:57.635 --> 01:19:01.005
would stop this conveyor belt,
and the Gulf Stream would slow

01:19:01.038 --> 01:19:04.809
down, stopping the transport
of heat from here, to there.

01:19:04.842 --> 01:19:07.478
And then Europe
would get cold toes.

01:19:07.512 --> 01:19:10.515
Because there's a lot of heat
transport from the Tropics,

01:19:10.548 --> 01:19:13.083
across the North Atlantic,
that keeps Europe warm. I mean.

01:19:13.117 --> 01:19:14.519
DICAPRIO: So Europe
would get colder?

01:19:14.552 --> 01:19:15.920
SELLERS: Yeah.

01:19:15.953 --> 01:19:16.987
DICAPRIO: Cause that's the
big misconception about

01:19:17.021 --> 01:19:18.989
climate change, is that
everything gets warmer.

01:19:19.023 --> 01:19:20.925
SELLERS: Yeah.
DICAPRIO: Wow.

01:19:20.958 --> 01:19:23.494
SELLERS: And here's the most
advanced precipitation satellite

01:19:23.528 --> 01:19:25.062
in the world.

01:19:25.095 --> 01:19:27.565
This is very important, cause we
think the biggest impact from

01:19:27.598 --> 01:19:30.868
climate change is the moving of
the precipitation belts.

01:19:30.901 --> 01:19:33.471
From the equator
they'll go further out,

01:19:33.504 --> 01:19:36.774
so we're already seeing
signs of a system drought.

01:19:36.807 --> 01:19:37.975
DICAPRIO: So that causes more
drought in places

01:19:38.008 --> 01:19:40.578
that are already too hot.
SELLERS: Yes.

01:19:40.611 --> 01:19:42.913
And there's a lot of papers
written in the State Department

01:19:42.947 --> 01:19:45.516
and elsewhere, how that
sustained drought has helped

01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:49.520
fuel the conflict of the Syrian
civil war, Darfur, Sudan,

01:19:49.554 --> 01:19:52.257
all these places that are
short of water, short of food.

01:19:52.290 --> 01:19:55.526
DICAPRIO: Is this throughout the
entire planet or is it just this

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.827
particular region right here?
SELLERS: Nope.

01:19:56.861 --> 01:19:58.696
We expect the whole world.

01:19:58.729 --> 01:20:03.167
We expect bits of India we
expect in the U. S., Oklahoma.

01:20:03.201 --> 01:20:05.803
You know the dust bowl region,
we expect that to get

01:20:05.836 --> 01:20:09.039
much, much drier over the
next few decades.

01:20:09.073 --> 01:20:12.810
DICAPRIO: Oh my God, and
what about my home state

01:20:12.843 --> 01:20:14.078
of California here?

01:20:14.111 --> 01:20:16.747
SELLERS: Um, not looking
great, I'm afraid.

01:20:16.781 --> 01:20:20.951
Now predicted persistent drought
in the dust bowl, and here,

01:20:20.985 --> 01:20:23.120
for fifty years from now.

01:20:23.153 --> 01:20:26.624
But we're just seeing the
worst drought in 900 years

01:20:26.657 --> 01:20:27.825
here right now.

01:20:27.858 --> 01:20:28.859
So it's coming a bit
earlier than we thought.

01:20:28.893 --> 01:20:31.128
We're talking about this
happening over a period

01:20:31.161 --> 01:20:32.797
of a few decades.

01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:34.865
DICAPRIO: It's just
consistent not great news.

01:20:34.899 --> 01:20:36.567
SELLERS: No.

01:20:36.601 --> 01:20:39.237
But a lot of people now kinda
confused about the issue.

01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:41.138
You know, the facts
are crystal clear.

01:20:41.172 --> 01:20:44.141
The ice is melting,
the earth is warming,

01:20:44.175 --> 01:20:45.710
the sea level is rising.

01:20:45.743 --> 01:20:47.212
Those are facts.

01:20:47.245 --> 01:20:49.914
Rather than feeling, oh my
God it's hopeless, say, okay,

01:20:49.947 --> 01:20:51.182
this is the problem.

01:20:51.216 --> 01:20:52.683
Let's be realistic.

01:20:52.717 --> 01:20:54.752
Let's find a way out of it.

01:20:54.785 --> 01:20:56.621
And there are ways out of it.

01:20:56.654 --> 01:21:00.258
You know, if we stopped
burning fossil fuel right now,

01:21:00.291 --> 01:21:02.193
the planet would still keep
warming for a little while

01:21:02.227 --> 01:21:04.729
before cooling off again.

01:21:04.762 --> 01:21:08.266
DICAPRIO: So you're saying
that if we do the right thing,

01:21:08.299 --> 01:21:10.568
we're gonna heat
up, or we're gonna.

01:21:10.601 --> 01:21:13.604
SELLERS: it'll turn off,
then it'll start cooling again.

01:21:13.638 --> 01:21:16.140
DICAPRIO: Would that Arctic ice
sheet start to then increase

01:21:16.174 --> 01:21:17.308
again?

01:21:17.342 --> 01:21:19.844
SELLERS: Once the
cooling started, yeah.

01:21:19.877 --> 01:21:22.913
DICAPRIO: So there really is
a possibility to repair

01:21:22.947 --> 01:21:24.782
this trajectory that we're on?
SELLERS: Absolutely.

01:21:24.815 --> 01:21:27.785
DICAPRIO: Interesting.
SELLERS: Yeah. So there's hope.

01:21:27.818 --> 01:21:30.588
DICAPRIO: You seem to have an
incredibly positive attitude,

01:21:30.621 --> 01:21:32.790
just about everything though.
It's amazing.

01:21:32.823 --> 01:21:35.960
SELLERS: Yeah, I, I do, I'm
actually basically an optimistic

01:21:35.993 --> 01:21:37.061
kind of person.

01:21:37.094 --> 01:21:38.896
I have faith in people.

01:21:38.929 --> 01:21:40.931
I, I really do have
faith in people.

01:21:40.965 --> 01:21:44.602
And I think that once people
come out of the fog of confusion

01:21:44.635 --> 01:21:46.804
or an issue, or initial
uncertainty on an issue,

01:21:46.837 --> 01:21:51.276
and realistically appreciate
it at some level, the threat,

01:21:51.309 --> 01:21:55.680
and they're informed of what the
best action is to deal with it,

01:21:55.713 --> 01:21:57.315
they got on and did it.

01:21:57.348 --> 01:22:00.084
And what seemed like almost
impossible to deal with,

01:22:00.117 --> 01:22:01.619
you know, became possible.

01:22:13.998 --> 01:22:16.100
DICAPRIO: I still think a lot
about that picture that used

01:22:16.133 --> 01:22:19.204
to hang over above my crib.

01:22:19.237 --> 01:22:22.373
The story of The Garden of
Earthly Delights actually begins

01:22:22.407 --> 01:22:24.709
on the outside of
the painting,

01:22:24.742 --> 01:22:28.213

of our Earth on the third day

01:22:28.246 --> 01:22:30.315
of creation.

01:22:30.348 --> 01:22:33.017
It's almost as if he wanted to
show the fragility of our

01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:37.722
planet by depicting the earth
and its atmosphere enclosed

01:22:37.755 --> 01:22:38.823

for immediate action to stop

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:05.416
global warming, and a
cry for justice for the poor.

01:23:08.786 --> 01:23:13.791
DICAPRIO: Our common home has
fallen into serious disrepair.

01:23:13.824 --> 01:23:17.962
Hope would have us recognize
that there is always a way out.

01:23:17.995 --> 01:23:21.799
That we can always
redirect our steps,

01:23:21.832 --> 01:23:27.372
that we can always do something
to solve our problems.

01:23:27.405 --> 01:23:31.476
Still, we can see signs that
things are now reaching

01:23:31.509 --> 01:23:33.311
a breaking point.

01:23:36.947 --> 01:23:41.352
This is a direct message from
the pope, it's a huge deal.

01:23:41.386 --> 01:23:46.324
[Leo practicing Italian].

01:23:46.357 --> 01:23:48.259
One of the most important
spiritual leader's

01:23:48.293 --> 01:23:50.027
on the planet.

01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:51.296
DRIVER: DiCaprio.

01:23:51.329 --> 01:23:54.499
DICAPRIO: He has now called upon
the world community to accept

01:23:54.532 --> 01:23:58.803
the modern science
of climate change.

01:23:58.836 --> 01:24:01.206
A pope has never done anything
like this in history.

01:24:08.179 --> 01:24:16.187
[Leo speaking Italian
to Pope Francis].

01:24:16.221 --> 01:24:19.457
DICAPRIO: Being able to spend
time and sit with the pope

01:24:19.490 --> 01:24:22.360
was a pretty
profound experience.

01:24:23.894 --> 01:24:29.334
This is a book,
Hieronymus Bosch's.

01:24:32.970 --> 01:24:35.340
Uh, it was hanging above
my crib, as a young boy.

01:24:38.509 --> 01:24:39.744
Thank you.

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:46.417
There was definitely an
urgency in his voice.

01:24:46.451 --> 01:24:51.989
He said that as far as the Paris
conference is concerned, he,

01:24:52.022 --> 01:24:54.024
he felt was a step in
the right direction,

01:24:54.058 --> 01:24:56.827
but certainly not enough.

01:24:56.861 --> 01:24:59.530
He feels we all need to keep
speaking out about this issue

01:24:59.564 --> 01:25:04.001
as loud as we can, and that we
must immediately take action.

01:25:06.304 --> 01:25:10.275
But more than anything, he said
to pray for the human race.

01:25:10.308 --> 01:25:21.286
♪ [MUSIC] ♪

01:25:21.319 --> 01:25:24.189
After everything I've seen,
it's become pretty obvious

01:25:24.222 --> 01:25:26.090
that we're no longer
living in that first,

01:25:26.123 --> 01:25:29.227
unspoiled depiction of Eden.

01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:32.029
We're in that second panel.

01:25:32.062 --> 01:25:35.900
What Bosch called, Human
Kind Before the Flood.

01:25:46.110 --> 01:25:50.881
And what haunts me the
most is that last panel.

01:25:50.915 --> 01:25:54.151
The one with the charred,
blackened skies.

01:25:54.185 --> 01:25:59.524
A planet that we collectively
have left to ruin.

01:25:59.557 --> 01:26:04.595
The question is, can we
change our course in time?

01:26:09.534 --> 01:26:13.137
Now if this was a movie we could
write the ending of this script,

01:26:13.171 --> 01:26:18.008
and we could figure a
way out of this mess.

01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:21.312
But real life doesn't
work like that,

01:26:21.346 --> 01:26:25.983
and we can't pretend that we
know how this is gonna end.

01:26:26.016 --> 01:26:31.356
The only thing that we can do
is control what we do next,

01:26:31.389 --> 01:26:39.464
how we live our lives, what we
consume, how we get involved,

01:26:39.497 --> 01:26:44.469
and how we use our vote to
tell our leaders that we know

01:26:44.502 --> 01:26:48.606
the truth about
climate change.

01:26:50.175 --> 01:26:53.378
KI‐MOON: The last speaker for
this signing ceremony is

01:26:53.411 --> 01:26:55.646
the Academy Award Best Actor,

01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:00.585
and the United Nations Messenger
of Peace, Mr. Leonardo DiCaprio.

01:27:00.618 --> 01:27:07.091
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:07.124 --> 01:27:09.026
DICAPRIO: Thank you Mr.
Secretary General for

01:27:09.059 --> 01:27:12.363
the honor to address this body,
and thanks to the distinguished

01:27:12.397 --> 01:27:15.333
climate leaders assembled
here today who are ready

01:27:15.366 --> 01:27:18.035
to take action.

01:27:18.068 --> 01:27:21.606
As a U. N. Messenger of Peace I
have traveled all over the world

01:27:21.639 --> 01:27:25.710
for the last two years, I have
seen cities like Beijing choked

01:27:25.743 --> 01:27:30.047
by industrial pollution, ancient
boreal forests in Canada

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:32.950
that have been clear cut, and
rainforests in Indonesia

01:27:32.983 --> 01:27:34.585
that have been incinerated.

01:27:34.619 --> 01:27:37.087
In India I met farmers whose
crops have been literally

01:27:37.121 --> 01:27:38.723
washed away.

01:27:38.756 --> 01:27:41.091
In America I've witnessed sea
level rise flooding the streets

01:27:41.125 --> 01:27:42.593
of Miami.

01:27:42.627 --> 01:27:45.630
In Greenland and in the Arctic
I was astonished to see

01:27:45.663 --> 01:27:48.966
that ancient glaciers are
rapidly disappearing,

01:27:48.999 --> 01:27:51.469
well ahead of
scientific predictions.

01:27:51.502 --> 01:27:55.506
All that I have seen and learned
on my journey has absolutely

01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:57.275
terrified me.

01:27:57.308 --> 01:27:59.677
Now think about the shame that
each of us will carry when our

01:27:59.710 --> 01:28:03.013
children and grandchildren look
back and realize that we had

01:28:03.047 --> 01:28:06.351
the means of stopping this
devastation but simply lacked

01:28:06.384 --> 01:28:09.119
the political will to do so.

01:28:09.153 --> 01:28:12.490
Yes, we have achieved
the Paris Agreement.

01:28:12.523 --> 01:28:14.625
More countries have come
together here to sign

01:28:14.659 --> 01:28:18.263
this agreement today than for
any other cause in the history

01:28:18.296 --> 01:28:22.166
of humankind, and that
is reason for hope.

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.002
But unfortunately the evidence
shows us that it will not

01:28:25.035 --> 01:28:26.304
be enough.

01:28:26.337 --> 01:28:29.407
A massive change is
required right now.

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:32.577
One that leads to a new
collective consciousness.

01:28:32.610 --> 01:28:35.646
A new collective evolution
of the human race,

01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:40.117
inspired and enabled by a sense
of urgency from all of you.

01:28:40.150 --> 01:28:42.753
We can congratulate
each other today,

01:28:42.787 --> 01:28:45.190
but it will mean absolutely
nothing if you return

01:28:45.223 --> 01:28:48.759
to your countries and fail
to push beyond the promises

01:28:48.793 --> 01:28:51.128
of this historic agreement.

01:28:51.161 --> 01:28:54.164
After 21 years of
debates and conferences,

01:28:54.199 --> 01:28:58.135
it is time to declare no
more talk, no more excuses,

01:28:58.168 --> 01:29:01.606
no more ten‐year studies, no
more allowing the fossil fuel

01:29:01.639 --> 01:29:05.410
companies to manipulate and
dictate the science and policies

01:29:05.443 --> 01:29:07.412
that affect our future.

01:29:07.445 --> 01:29:09.780
The world is now watching.

01:29:09.814 --> 01:29:13.150
You'll either be lauded
by future generations,

01:29:13.184 --> 01:29:14.752
or vilified by them.

01:29:14.785 --> 01:29:18.789
You are the last
best hope of Earth.

01:29:18.823 --> 01:29:21.091
We ask you to protect it,

01:29:21.125 --> 01:29:25.630
or we, and all living things
we cherish, are history.
