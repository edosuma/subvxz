        A SECOND, PLEASE?

45:59.190 --> 46:00.223
                         THANKS.

46:14.739 --> 46:16.205
    WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

46:16.241 --> 46:17.874
      I WENT TO YOUR PLACE,
       YOU WEREN'T THERE.

46:17.909 --> 46:20.443
I GAVE YOUR HOUSEKEEPER 50 BUCKS
   TO TELL ME WHERE YOU WERE.

46:20.478 --> 46:22.378
       WELL, SHE'S FIRED.

46:22.413 --> 46:23.980
       IS NOW A BAD TIME?

46:24.015 --> 46:25.581
     I'M NOT TALKING FIRST.

46:25.617 --> 46:26.916

         LOOK, I'M SORRY
   I DIDN'T RETURN YOUR CALLS,

46:37.862 --> 46:40.596
    BUT THE MORE TIME PASSED,

46:40.632 --> 46:43.466
 THE EASIER IT WAS NOT TO CALL.

46:43.501 --> 46:45.802
   WELL, IT GOT HARDER FOR ME.

46:45.837 --> 46:47.003
     EVERY DAY THAT WENT BY

46:47.038 --> 46:49.305
     GOT HARDER THAN THE ONE
        BEFORE IT, SO...

46:49.340 --> 46:51.574
     I'M SORRY IT WAS EASIER
       AND EASIER FOR YOU,

46:51.609 --> 46:53.676
   BUT THAT'S NOT HOW I FELT.

46:53.711 --> 46:55.511
   I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

46:59.317 --> 47:00.616
 I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING, OKAY?

I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

47:02.954 --> 47:04.487
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I WAS ANGRY WITH YOU

47:04.522 --> 47:05.755
FOR SO LONG,

47:05.790 --> 47:06.889
 BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.

47:06.925 --> 47:08.658
         WHAT MATTERS...

47:08.693 --> 47:09.959
             [SIGHS]

47:09.994 --> 47:11.627
 WHAT MATTERS IS I FORGIVE YOU,

47:11.663 --> 47:12.862
      AND I JUST WANTED YOU
          TO KNOW THAT.

47:12.897 --> 47:15.464
       [LAUGHS, SCOFFING]
       OH, YOU FORGIVE ME?

47:15.500 --> 47:17.133
  YOU TOOK YOUR FRIENDSHIP AWAY

47:17.168 --> 47:19.202
          WITHOUT EVEN
     TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT!

47:19.237 --> 47:20.837
                OR YELLING AT ME
                ABOUT IT!

47:20.872 --> 47:23.105
   IT MEANT EVERYTHING TO ME.

47:26.678 --> 47:27.877
        I TRUSTED IN IT.

47:27.912 --> 47:29.145
        I BELIEVED IN IT.

47:29.180 --> 47:30.847
                 BUT YOU DIDN'T,

47:30.882 --> 47:32.615
       AND NOW IT'S GONE.

47:32.650 --> 47:37.353
 SO, THANK YOU FOR FORGIVING ME,
    BUT I DON'T FORGIVE YOU.

47:37.388 --> 47:39.288
YOU WERE RIGHT.

47:39.324 --> 47:41.624
         I WAS JEALOUS,

47:41.659 --> 47:44.627
   AND I HATED MYSELF FOR IT.

47:44.662 --> 47:45.962
    BUT YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

47:45.997 --> 47:47.196
              YOU ARE CONFIDENT,

47:47.232 --> 47:50.299
                YOU'RE STRONG,
                YOU'RE TALENTED,

47:50.335 --> 47:52.501
     AND I COULDN'T COMPETE
           WITH THAT.

47:55.974 --> 47:57.740
     YOU ARE SMART,

47:57.775 --> 47:59.442
AND YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL,

47:59.477 --> 48:00.543
AND YOU DO EVERYTHING WELL,

48:00.578 --> 48:02.511
AND PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU.

48:07.485 --> 48:08.918
IT'S MY FAULT.

48:08.953 --> 48:09.919
             NO, DON'T BE SILLY,

48:09.954 --> 48:12.622
               IT WAS OUR FAULT.

48:12.657 --> 48:13.990
             AND I'M SORRY.

48:17.362 --> 48:18.794
           -PREGNANT!
              -YES.

48:18.830 --> 48:20.863

48:20.899 --> 48:22.231
     YOU'RE HAVING A BABY? SHIT!

48:22.267 --> 48:23.366
I'M HAVING A BABY,

48:23.401 --> 48:25.534
          AND HE WANTS
     NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

48:25.570 --> 48:26.869
      HE DIDN'T WANT KIDS,

48:26.905 --> 48:28.404
OR AT LEAST NOT WITH ME.

48:28.439 --> 48:29.839
MAYBE WITH HER,
BUT NOT WITH ME.

                    WHO?

48:30.875 --> 48:31.908
HIS GIRLFRIEND!

48:31.943 --> 48:33.376
WELL, NOW I THINK
SHE'S HIS FIANCE, BUT...

48:33.411 --> 48:35.611
         HE SIGNED OVER
   ALL OF HIS PARENTAL RIGHTS

48:35.647 --> 48:38.247
   SO HE COULD MOVE TO BOSTON
   AND START A LIFE WITH HER.

48:38.283 --> 48:39.548
                OKAY, WAIT,

48:39.584 --> 48:41.550
       YOU CATCH WHAT'S-HIS-FACE
       WITH ANOTHER WOMAN,

48:41.586 --> 48:43.886
           AND NOW YOU'RE HAVIN?

              I UNDERSTAND THAT,
              BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,

49:15.820 --> 49:17.053
                 I THINK THIS IS
                 GONNA BE FUN,

         YOU NEED THAT FOR THIS.

        ALL WE HAVE TO DO

49:24.529 --> 49:28.064
