00:01.000 --> 00:03.161
Previously on
"Pretty Little Liars.."

00:03.200 --> 00:04.690
Charlotte was dead when she was
thrown from the bell tower.

00:04.730 --> 00:06.095
She was murdered?

00:06.140 --> 00:07.368
I think the person
the cop should really be

00:07.400 --> 00:08.628
talking to
is right over there.

00:08.670 --> 00:10.331
She chose to help
Charlotte torture us.

00:11.740 --> 00:13.401
Mm. God, I missed you.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.431
Never been really good
with needles.

00:15.480 --> 00:16.777
You live in California

00:16.810 --> 00:18.368
but you're doing
your treatments here?

00:18.410 --> 00:20.219
(Spencer)
Family that campaigns together

00:20.250 --> 00:21.239
stays together.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.747
They won't take back
the advance.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.382
They are not going
to love the follow-up.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.215
It's time to tell us
what really happened that night.

00:28.260 --> 00:29.386
(Emily)
You left the hotel with Ezra

00:29.430 --> 00:30.749
and you came back a half hour

00:30.790 --> 00:32.257
after Charlotte was killed.

00:33.460 --> 00:36.327
We didn't see each other the
night that Charlotte was killed.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.224
You didn't call me,
I didn't leave the hotel

00:38.270 --> 00:40.659
we didn't walk
or talk or go anywhere.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.258
Whatever you say, Aria.

00:43.170 --> 00:45.263
[instrumental music]

00:46.540 --> 00:49.247
I've never had a salt rub.
Does it hurt?

00:49.280 --> 00:52.249
Can't be worse than a sugar wax.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.373
Why didn't she meet us here?

00:54.420 --> 00:57.241
- Spencer, let it go.
- Why lie?

00:57.290 --> 00:59.554
Why not just say
I snuck out to go meet Ezra?

00:59.590 --> 01:01.319
She's got a boyfriend
in Cambridge.

01:01.360 --> 01:04.329
Oh, please, this is about
so much more than that.

01:04.360 --> 01:05.486
If we had never
told her about that

01:05.530 --> 01:06.758
security tape,
she wouldn't have--

01:06.800 --> 01:08.358
This is so not relaxing.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.697
Hanna, the police didn't ask us

01:09.730 --> 01:11.095
to stick around to exfoliate.

01:11.130 --> 01:12.233
There are gonna be questions.

01:12.270 --> 01:13.259
Aria doesn't know where

01:13.300 --> 01:14.528
Ezra went after she left him.

01:14.570 --> 01:16.367
Yeah, but she knows that
he was in a dark place.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.638
Just 'cause you're depressed
doesn't mean

01:17.670 --> 01:19.137
you pick up a weapon.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.238
Okay, you guys, my mom gave us

01:20.280 --> 01:21.429
these passes as a gift.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.301
We're here to chill, not spill.

01:24.350 --> 01:26.511
It's just so twisted.

01:26.550 --> 01:29.189
She hasn't even spoken
to Fitz in, like, five years

01:29.220 --> 01:31.108
and now if he did this for her

01:31.150 --> 01:34.256
they're gonna be
bound together forever.

01:34.290 --> 01:38.522
Not because of the tape.
It's gone.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.596
What? You erased it?

01:40.630 --> 01:43.224
- When?
- Doesn't matter. It's done.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.521
(Hanna)
'What do you guys think
this room was'

01:44.570 --> 01:46.435
'before they
turned the nuthouse into a spa?‘

01:46.470 --> 01:47.289
Why?

01:47.340 --> 01:50.366
The sauna smelled
like burned hair.

01:50.410 --> 01:52.731
Okay, that's it.
I'm done chilling.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.873
- Wait, what are you guys doing?
- I'm gonna go get dressed.

01:54.910 --> 01:56.309
I have to meet with Melissa.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.409
We have a meeting
with my mom's campaign team.

01:58.450 --> 02:00.645
- Yeah, I think I wanna go too.
- Well, we can't leave.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.513
We have appointments!
You can't do this.

02:03.550 --> 02:05.814
Come on, guys.

02:05.850 --> 02:08.159
(Emily)
I left my key in there.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.228
[intense music]

02:17.730 --> 02:19.869
Sara?

02:19.900 --> 02:21.390
'How long have you been there?‘

02:21.440 --> 02:23.362
And why are you following me?

02:23.410 --> 02:25.401
First the cemetery and now here?

02:25.440 --> 02:26.771
I wasn't following you.

02:26.810 --> 02:28.505
I was saying goodbye to someone.

02:28.540 --> 02:30.371
Who? Charlotte?

02:30.410 --> 02:32.640
The person you claimed in court
scrambled your brains

02:32.680 --> 02:34.375
and stole your soul?

02:34.420 --> 02:36.888
Why did you even come
to Rosewood?

02:36.920 --> 02:38.342
Answer me!

02:38.390 --> 02:41.314
Last time I checked,
this was the quiet room.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.194
* Got a secret can you keep it

02:46.230 --> 02:48.619
* Swear this one you'll save

02:48.660 --> 02:51.265
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

02:51.300 --> 02:53.666
* Takin' this one to the grave

02:53.700 --> 02:58.637
* If I show you then I know you
won't tell what I said *

02:58.670 --> 03:01.309
* 'Cause two can keep a secret

03:01.340 --> 03:03.740
* If one of them is dead *

03:06.920 --> 03:08.410
(Liam on laptop)
'It's no sweat
if you can't find it.'

03:08.450 --> 03:09.815
No, I have printed
everything out.

03:09.850 --> 03:12.353
- This whole stack is coverage.
- Just resend the e-mail.

03:12.390 --> 03:13.550
Jillian's not back
till tomorrow.

03:13.590 --> 03:17.754
Is that a stuffed pig
behind you?

03:17.790 --> 03:19.553
Yeah, that's Pigtunia.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.919
Wait, is there a picture
of Justin Timberlake

03:20.960 --> 03:22.268
on one of those walls?

03:22.300 --> 03:23.369
Wait a second,
I thought you said that

03:23.400 --> 03:25.265
Jillian wasn't back till Friday.

03:25.300 --> 03:26.631
Nah, she's coming back early.

03:26.670 --> 03:28.535
But don't freak
about the Fitz pages.

03:28.570 --> 03:31.733
She's, um, kind of over him.

03:31.770 --> 03:32.737
What does that mean?

03:32.780 --> 03:34.702
I guess she called
your old teacher yesterday

03:34.740 --> 03:36.799
and said he sounded wasted
at 11 in the morning.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.738
He wasn't wasted.

03:38.780 --> 03:40.748
The man is dealing
with a lot of grief right now.

03:40.780 --> 03:42.884
Whoa. Well, don't scorch me.
I'm a fan.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.548
I think the guy's definitely
got more stories to tell.

03:48.690 --> 03:50.954
I gotta go.
Hey, don't lose sleep over Fitz.

03:50.990 --> 03:53.458
He'll share
when he's ready, okay?

03:58.570 --> 04:01.869
Detective Calderon,
what's this regarding?

04:01.900 --> 04:04.767
My colleagues are studying the
hotel's security footage from

04:04.810 --> 04:06.675
the night Charlotte DiLaurentis
was murdered.

04:06.710 --> 04:08.735
Yes, I already gave them
access to everything.

04:08.780 --> 04:10.270
You did, but apparently

04:10.310 --> 04:12.346
there was nothing recorded
after midnight.

04:12.380 --> 04:14.473
The tape skips
to noon the next day.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.011
Oh! Well, I'm not really
well-versed in the technical--

04:17.050 --> 04:18.540
Me neither.

04:18.590 --> 04:20.410
But we have an IT specialist
trying to determine

04:20.460 --> 04:23.429
whether there was a malfunction
of the device or..

04:23.460 --> 04:27.749
- Or?
- Whether it was deleted.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.520
I'm sorry.
What are you implying?

04:31.570 --> 04:33.037
We haven't reached
any conclu5|ons yet, ma'am

04:33.070 --> 04:36.403
but I will need a list of
the staff that worked that shift

04:36.440 --> 04:39.261
'and the hotel guests
who stayed here that night.‘

04:41.510 --> 04:43.876
Well, there are no health
food stores here, Claudia.

04:43.910 --> 04:45.309
Believe me, I grew up here.

04:45.350 --> 04:47.773
Ithought
butter was a side dish.

04:47.820 --> 04:51.483
Yeah. Yeah, I'll overnight
the magnesium.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.818
Well, what day is it in Tokyo?

04:53.860 --> 04:56.920
Okay, well, then
you'll get it yesterday.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.053
Hello? Claudia?

04:59.090 --> 05:01.820
Hanna?

05:01.860 --> 05:05.591
Lucas! Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

05:05.630 --> 05:09.031
[chuckles]
Didn't you see me waving?
I honked at you.

05:09.070 --> 05:11.459
Wait, that was you
in the silver Jag?

05:11.510 --> 05:12.932
Can you look
a little less shocked?

05:12.980 --> 05:16.973
I am not shocked,
I'm impressed. How are you?

05:17.010 --> 05:19.069
Last time I heard, you were,
like, movin' to Chicago.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.817
Uh, Seattle.
But I sold that company.

05:21.850 --> 05:23.044
I do game apps now.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.819
Uh, do you still live
with your folks?

05:24.850 --> 05:28.411
Oh, uh, no, I, uh, have
a condo in Palo Alto

05:28.460 --> 05:30.519
and a town house in Hong Kong

05:30.560 --> 05:33.654
and a loft above The Grille.

05:33.700 --> 05:37.067
But, hey! Look at you.
Sporting bling.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.660
Did Caleb finally propose?

05:39.700 --> 05:40.997
No. No.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.009
Uh, Caleb and I,
we split up a few years ago.

05:44.040 --> 05:48.477
But my fiance, Jordan,
we live in New York.

05:48.510 --> 05:51.001
Wow! Now I'm shocked.

05:51.050 --> 05:53.439
Well, you know,
we're still friends.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.549
[cell phone rings]

05:54.580 --> 05:58.380
[sighs]
It's probably my boss.

05:58.420 --> 06:00.581
_ Is - Oh!
everything okay?

06:00.620 --> 06:02.429
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.

06:02.460 --> 06:03.427
Um, you know what, I gotta go.

06:03.460 --> 06:06.691
But I-I wanna drive that car.

06:06.730 --> 06:07.492
[sighs]

06:09.870 --> 06:12.896
Oh, I forgot
you were camping out here.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.569
Yeah, me
and the other water bugs.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.009
'Where's Spencer?‘

06:18.040 --> 06:21.874
She's just finishing up
the strategy session with Gil.

06:21.910 --> 06:24.049
Hey, what about,
uh, her college paper?

06:24.080 --> 06:26.446
How did they react to that?

06:26.480 --> 06:29.779
They asked her
to adjust her interview style.

06:29.820 --> 06:32.653
I know I had more clothes here.

06:32.690 --> 06:33.714
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.182
- How did it go?
- Not good.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.927
- They asked me to lie.
- They don't want you to lie.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.724
Okay, they want me to use
a non-denial denial.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.694
- So lying.
- Yeah.

06:42.730 --> 06:45.096
If you can avoid addressing
certain things, you should.

06:45.130 --> 06:46.563
No, don't take off your shoes.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.999
'We've to be at Hollis
in 30 minutes.‘

06:48.040 --> 06:50.429
What is this Hollis thing?
Gil asked me to post about it.

06:50.470 --> 06:51.937
Registering college kids to vote

06:51.970 --> 06:54.837
to try to reverse the political
apathy of our youth.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.745
- That's noble.
- It's really not.

06:56.780 --> 06:58.941
It's a photo-op
for the candidate's children

06:58.980 --> 07:00.208
who are starving.

07:00.250 --> 07:01.615
Okay, well,
I'll make you some eggs.

07:01.650 --> 07:02.617
Uh, do you want some toast?

07:02.650 --> 07:04.208
Oh, my God, please.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.787
- Burned.
- That's the only way I make it.

07:06.820 --> 07:09.209
I'm gonna go steal some stuff
from the campaign headquarters.

07:09.260 --> 07:10.557
(Spencer)
'Mm.‘

07:16.200 --> 07:18.828
- When did that happen?
- What?

07:18.870 --> 07:22.966
- Caleb? We're friends.
- Really?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.238
'Cause I know
how you like to shop

07:24.270 --> 07:26.704
out of other people's carts.

07:26.740 --> 07:28.901
[scoffs]
If you're referring to Hanna

07:28.940 --> 07:31.943
that cart is engaged
to someone else.

07:31.980 --> 07:35.074
It really doesn't matter because
there's nothing going on.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.612
Maybe you're more comfortable
with lying than you think.

07:44.660 --> 07:45.888
Uh, are you leaving?

07:45.930 --> 07:47.488
I thought we were
having lunch today.

07:47.530 --> 07:48.758
Yeah, I just had to pick up

07:48.800 --> 07:50.961
a few things from the drugstore.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.264
You know, I only planned
on being here for a day or two.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.495
- Do you need anything?
- No.

07:55.540 --> 08:00.170
You know, I, um, I spoke
with, with Will Perkins.

08:00.210 --> 08:01.871
Your dad's friend, the medic.

08:01.910 --> 08:04.708
And he'd be happy to write you a
recommendation for grad school.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.639
Um, you didn't have
to do that. It's..

08:07.680 --> 08:11.081
Are you kidding? I wanted to.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.509
Alright. Um, see you later.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.267
[car engine rewing]

08:23.300 --> 08:26.167
Em, Emily!

08:26.200 --> 08:27.497
[sighs]

08:38.980 --> 08:40.208
Hear what?

08:41.620 --> 08:43.713
with that security tape.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.581
If you
or your friends tampered--

08:45.620 --> 08:47.281
I didn't.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.287
Why would I have to
tamper with it?

08:48.320 --> 08:50.788
I'm not in high school anymore.

08:50.830 --> 08:53.094
Ashley, excuse me. Jen just
took this message for you.

08:53.130 --> 08:54.597
Thank you.

09:00.700 --> 09:03.601
Well, it gets worse.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.301
What? What's wrong?
Who's that from?

09:05.340 --> 09:06.739
It's from Detective Calderon.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.270
They just confirmed

09:08.310 --> 09:10.870
that the tape was erased.

09:10.910 --> 09:12.047
And they want me
to go down to the precinct

09:12.080 --> 09:13.968
this afternoon
for further questioning.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.772
Why do they need
to speak to you?

09:15.820 --> 09:18.789
They're investigating
a murder, Hanna.

09:18.820 --> 09:20.151
I have a daughter
who was staying here

09:20.190 --> 09:22.658
who was once tortured
by the Victim.

09:22.690 --> 09:24.749
Don't look so surprised.

09:37.210 --> 09:40.270
Do you know what you want?

09:40.310 --> 09:42.130
What?

09:42.180 --> 09:43.977
Oh, no. Um, I'm good.

09:44.010 --> 09:46.149
Just whatever you're having,
you can order two of them.

09:46.180 --> 09:48.341
Excuse me. Sorry.
Are you our waiter?

09:48.380 --> 09:50.143
Great. Um, I'll have a, a beer.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.784
Anything you have
on draft will be great.

09:52.820 --> 09:54.617
What about you?

09:54.660 --> 09:56.719
Iced tea, thank you.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.692
So, um..

10:03.800 --> 10:05.620
...I looked at that thumb drive

10:05.670 --> 10:06.864
that I took from your place.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.390
That's just research.

10:08.440 --> 10:11.409
Ezra, there were some
horrifying images.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.102
Yeah, I know. I..

10:15.780 --> 10:17.372
Uh, is-is there anything else

10:17.410 --> 10:20.140
on there other than research?

10:20.180 --> 10:21.613
Here.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.787
There. That's...what I have.

10:27.820 --> 10:29.253
I-I started the first chapter
in Colombia

10:29.290 --> 10:30.882
and I was about

10:30.930 --> 10:34.320
halfway through the second
when...Nicole..

10:34.360 --> 10:37.090
Look, it's crap. It's crap.

10:37.130 --> 10:39.894
And I know that
you don't wanna gIve up

10:39.940 --> 10:43.103
until I hand it over,
so there it is.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.977
_ Hello _there. _
Forgive the interruption.

10:47.010 --> 10:49.877
Your waiter will be right over
with two iced teas.

10:49.910 --> 10:52.777
Um, I, I ordered a beer.

10:52.820 --> 10:56.415
I know, Ezra.
We can't serve you that.

10:56.450 --> 10:58.748
[chuckles]
Are you, are you kidding me?

10:58.790 --> 11:01.816
- What's going on?
- Please, this is awkward.

11:01.860 --> 11:04.681
Look, Ashley,
nobody broke a chair.

11:04.730 --> 11:06.789
It was an incident.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.859
I'm sorry.

11:11.900 --> 11:14.232
- Enjoy your lunch.
- Thank you.

11:18.170 --> 11:20.001
(Damian)
What's your take on that?

11:20.040 --> 11:23.305
Why is the turnout of
millennial voters so sluggish?

11:23.350 --> 11:26.171
Well, most young people
don't have a permanent address

11:26.210 --> 11:28.144
so it's very difficult
for them to register.

11:28.180 --> 11:31.149
So are you sticking around
Rosewood solely for your mom

11:31.190 --> 11:33.852
or are there other things
keeping you here?

11:35.960 --> 11:38.281
The death
of Charlotte DiLaurentis

11:38.330 --> 11:40.423
must have thrown you?

11:40.460 --> 11:42.291
Yes, and how could it not?

11:42.330 --> 11:44.469
This person had
a huge impact on my life.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.967
And it does take time to process

11:46.000 --> 11:47.490
an upsetting event
before one can move on.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.008
I'm surprised
you'd use the word upsetting.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.339
Most people on social media
assume that you're celebrating.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.031
Well, the media's gonna create
the narrative they wanna tell.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.342
So you object to that narrative?

11:57.380 --> 11:59.075
No, what I object to

11:59.110 --> 12:01.510
are people who are desperate
to find a connection.

12:01.550 --> 12:04.041
Sometimes a cigar
is just a cigar.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.452
Can you excuse me
for just a moment?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.388
Sure.

12:15.430 --> 12:18.194
- What are you doing here?
- My mom's in trouble.

12:20.170 --> 12:21.262
'(Pam)
Emily!'

12:23.140 --> 12:25.267
Emily.

12:25.310 --> 12:27.778
[panﬁng]
Emily.

12:27.810 --> 12:28.902
Mom, what's the matter?

12:28.940 --> 12:31.044
Maybe you can explain this.

12:34.480 --> 12:38.314
Was it all just lies? I mean,
all the, all the details from--

12:38.350 --> 12:39.009
Mom, please.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.915
I must've looked like an idiot

12:40.960 --> 12:42.825
sending you care packages,
because you didn't like

12:42.860 --> 12:44.828
the food in the cafeteria.

12:45.460 --> 12:48.395
'When did you drop out?‘

12:48.430 --> 12:50.796
Mom, can we please not talk
about this here? Please?

12:50.830 --> 12:52.422
No,ugh!

12:52.470 --> 12:53.869
Fine.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.099
Lorenzo knows
the tape was erased.

13:00.140 --> 13:01.232
Alright? So you
have to ask your mom--

13:01.280 --> 13:03.043
No. My mom's not
an attorney right now.

13:03.080 --> 13:06.277
She's a candidate, I cannot ask
her anything and I can't talk

13:06.310 --> 13:07.538
to you right now. I'm in
the middle of an interview.

13:07.580 --> 13:08.979
Spencer, the police have a list

13:09.020 --> 13:11.238
of everyone who stayed
at the hotel that night.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.918
Someone was murdered
and you're gonna get questioned.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.279
We all are.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.997
[sighs]
Hey, I'm so sorry about that.

13:23.030 --> 13:25.066
Wasn't that one of the other
girls from the bunker?

13:25.100 --> 13:27.989
Is she still in town
because of Charlotte?

13:28.040 --> 13:29.291
You know what,
I think that maybe

13:29.340 --> 13:30.967
I should just get back
to registering the students.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.204
Wait. Just one more question.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.901
No, I'm sorry.
I really don't have time.

13:33.940 --> 13:35.100
I'm only here
to spread the message.

13:35.140 --> 13:36.334
Be inspired
to create the future

13:36.380 --> 13:38.177
that you imagine by voting.

13:38.210 --> 13:39.279
Thank you.

13:42.150 --> 13:44.084
(Pam)
'I don't understand, Emily.'

13:44.120 --> 13:48.250
It wasn't a decision.
It just...happened.

13:48.290 --> 13:51.589
- Did you get kicked out?
- No.

13:51.630 --> 13:54.326
Honey, why didn't you call me

13:54.360 --> 13:56.055
if you were going
through something?

13:56.100 --> 13:59.467
Mom, you worried
ifI skipped a meal.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.833
How was I suppose to tell you
I was skipping school?

14:04.910 --> 14:07.401
Did you get that
at a costume shop?

14:09.680 --> 14:11.307
[sighs]

14:11.350 --> 14:15.548
I'm goin' home.

14:15.580 --> 14:17.309
[sighs]

14:17.350 --> 14:19.045
[knock on door]

14:22.490 --> 14:25.948
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.094
I need your help.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.964
Do you want anything to drink?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.228
'I haven't been here in a while'

14:35.270 --> 14:36.567
but there might be
an old coconut water--

14:36.600 --> 14:37.601
I'll pass.

14:37.640 --> 14:40.029
Uh, do you live here alone?

14:41.980 --> 14:43.277
Well, I had a hamster

14:43.310 --> 14:45.949
but I'm out of town
all the time, so he..

14:45.980 --> 14:47.015
Were you here the night that

14:47.050 --> 14:49.245
Charlotte DiLaurentis
was killed?

14:49.280 --> 14:50.247
Why?

14:53.320 --> 14:56.926
After the hearing,
we all went back to the hotel

14:56.960 --> 14:59.178
and we got trashed.

14:59.590 --> 15:01.455
And?

15:01.500 --> 15:04.321
We collapsed in my room.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.224
But now the police think
that we snuck out

15:06.270 --> 15:10.263
and we killed A or Charlotte.

15:14.110 --> 15:16.476
Well, I was thinking maybe..

15:16.510 --> 15:19.308
...maybe you could say
that you-you came to my room

15:19.350 --> 15:20.942
and you-you brought me take-out

15:20.980 --> 15:22.618
and we talked
until the sun came up.

15:22.650 --> 15:24.208
[sighs]

15:26.250 --> 15:28.684
[sighs]
You know what?

15:28.720 --> 15:32.451
Forget that.
Um, I'm sorry I even asked.

15:32.490 --> 15:35.391
- You want me to be your alibi?
- No. No, I don't.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.421
I really didn't think
this through.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.064
Let's just pretend
that I never came here.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.330
Hey, when you're in New York,
let's get dinner.

15:42.370 --> 15:43.962
Uh, Hanna.

15:45.210 --> 15:48.304
You need me, I'm there for you.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.674

he finally found his match."

16:02.260 --> 16:05.650
Okay, is it just me
or is this amazing?

16:05.690 --> 16:07.692
Uh, I-I-I mean
there's some stuff

16:07.730 --> 16:09.095
that needs connective tissue--

16:09.130 --> 16:11.223
- Is he writin' about you?
- What?

16:11.270 --> 16:12.294
What're you talking about? No.

16:12.330 --> 16:13.558
This book is about
him and Nicole.

16:15.370 --> 16:16.769
She was small like me. Big deal.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.506
Ezra likes sma||_ women.
Get a grip.

16:18.540 --> 16:19.768
[scoffs]

16:19.810 --> 16:21.300
Why would you say that?

16:21.340 --> 16:22.705
Aria, you guys went
through a lot together.

16:22.740 --> 16:25.675
- That was high school.
- Not for him.

16:25.710 --> 16:27.211
Why are you so upset?

16:27.250 --> 16:28.478
It's just been
a rough couple of days.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.215
And we're readin'
an unfinished novel

16:30.250 --> 16:31.410
by somebody
who may have killed--

16:31.450 --> 16:34.089
Emily, don't.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.088
He said he went home.

16:36.120 --> 16:40.659
Okay, well, tell me
why Sara Harvey won't..

16:40.700 --> 16:42.122
...go home?

16:42.160 --> 16:44.060
Everywhere I go,
she's been shadowing me

16:44.100 --> 16:45.397
like some dark cloud.

16:45.430 --> 16:47.432
I'm afraid that
she might know something.

16:47.470 --> 16:49.631
I mean, was she sitting
in that lobby that night?

16:49.670 --> 16:52.559
Wait. Can't Hanna's mom
just kick her out of the hotel?

16:52.610 --> 16:53.599
For what?

16:53.640 --> 16:54.709
You can't evict somebody

16:54.740 --> 16:57.174
for eating fried chicken
with gloves.

16:57.210 --> 17:00.316
Okay, well, just stop
thinking about her.

17:00.350 --> 17:02.671
- Go have dinner with your mom.
- No.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.244
I'll sit here.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.048
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.419
Uh, come in.

17:19.770 --> 17:22.568
- What's this?
- Uh, research.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.467
My boss wants to buy a cat
while she's in Asia.

17:25.510 --> 17:28.377
They have this weird breed
with super short legs.

17:28.410 --> 17:30.241
They call them munchkins.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.544
It's only slightly offensive.

17:32.580 --> 17:35.219
Yeah. Well, so is my boss.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.684
Look, I'm really sorry..

17:37.720 --> 17:39.779
...about the way
that I talked to you today.

17:39.820 --> 17:42.357
I was just so focused on trying
to be my mom's savior--

17:42.390 --> 17:45.427
No, it's fine.
Lucas is gonna help us.

17:45.460 --> 17:47.758
- He is gonna be our alibi.
- Really?

17:54.470 --> 17:57.530
No, it's Jordan
calling me to say goodnight.

17:57.570 --> 17:59.663
- Oh, let me give you guys a--
- No, it's fine.

17:59.710 --> 18:01.678
I'll just call him back.

18:04.310 --> 18:06.540
You seem really happy.

18:09.420 --> 18:13.880
So, um, is it weird
now for you to

18:13.920 --> 18:15.785
for you to see Caleb?

18:15.820 --> 18:17.378
No.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.228
I'm getting married, Spencer.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.649
God, why does everybody
keep asking me about Caleb?

18:22.700 --> 18:26.568
I, I didn't realize
anybody else had.

18:30.540 --> 18:31.666
Oh!

18:38.680 --> 18:40.671
So..

18:40.720 --> 18:44.281
...do you have feelings for..

18:50.660 --> 18:53.197
So when you, um..

18:53.230 --> 18:55.323
When you guys, uh,
met up in Spain, did you--

18:55.360 --> 18:57.920
No, no, I would
never do that to you.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.165
I'd.. No.

19:03.570 --> 19:06.562
And I don't even know
if he feels the same way.

19:13.580 --> 19:15.172
Well, then..

19:16.580 --> 19:19.219
...I think that
you should find out.

19:26.330 --> 19:28.525
I figured
if anyone could decipher

19:28.560 --> 19:29.925
your chicken scratch,
it'd be me.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.930
But there were even a few words
that I couldn't--

19:33.970 --> 19:36.438
Why did you do this?

19:36.470 --> 19:38.665
'Cause I-I thought that maybe

19:38.710 --> 19:41.634
if you...saw it
in a different form

19:41.680 --> 19:45.446
it...would inspire you
to pick up where you left off.

It's really good, Ezra.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.538
Really good.

Look, forget about
who I work for. Okay?

19:57.290 --> 19:59.781
I don't give a damn
what anyone else thinks.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.752
This is me talking.

20:02.900 --> 20:05.528
You need to finish this book.

20:05.570 --> 20:09.461
I want the entire world
to know who you really are.

You are compassionate

20:14.710 --> 20:16.302
You're kind.

20:17.310 --> 20:18.971

20:40.570 --> 20:43.300
Are you here
to finish our interview?

20:43.340 --> 20:44.932
I came to ask you
if your article was really about

20:44.970 --> 20:47.700
millennials and politics
or if you have another angle?

20:49.710 --> 20:51.678
The bunker girls.

Um, I think you need to relax.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.664
into Charlotte's dollhouse?

21:10.700 --> 21:13.396
Uh, no,
she's scheduling a sit-down

21:13.440 --> 21:16.000
with the opponent's daughter.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.359
What?

21:17.410 --> 21:20.061
Mona's working
for the other camp.

21:20.110 --> 21:21.930
[scoffs]
I'm sorry. When did this happen?

21:21.980 --> 21:23.004
Well, don't look at me.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.075
Apparently Mona approached

21:24.110 --> 21:25.407
your mom about working

21:25.450 --> 21:26.508
for her campaign first

21:26.550 --> 21:29.644
but was shown the door.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.545
Wow.

21:31.590 --> 21:34.479
You really didn't know.

21:34.520 --> 21:35.953
I've heard of inner circles

21:35.990 --> 21:38.788
but leaving your daughter out..

21:38.830 --> 21:40.491
...that's cold.

21:43.830 --> 21:46.424
- When do you have to go in?
- 5.

21:46.470 --> 21:47.892
- He already grilled my mom.
- Alright, Hanna.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.465
Don't forget.
This is Lorenzo, not Wilden.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.535
He's not bent on making
Ali's friends look like--

21:52.570 --> 21:55.733
Friends? Have you heard
from All since that dinner?

21:55.780 --> 21:57.668
Have you?

21:57.710 --> 22:00.713
Alison is not looking to make
any more friendship bracelets.

22:00.750 --> 22:02.809
I thought you said
Lucas was gonna help.

22:02.850 --> 22:04.442
You're worried
he won't come through?

22:04.490 --> 22:05.912
I'm worried
about everything, Emily.

22:05.950 --> 22:08.555
My mom losing her job,
my boss firing me

22:08.590 --> 22:10.820
because I didn't send
the right laxative to Tolqo.

22:10.860 --> 22:11.849
Everything!

22:13.090 --> 22:14.694
Do you wanna mix
that with water?

22:14.730 --> 22:15.890
No.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.124
God, I hate that
I'm in this place

22:19.170 --> 22:20.569
and being forced to lie like

22:20.600 --> 22:22.591
I'm in 11th grade
all over again.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.369
[cell phone ringing]

22:24.410 --> 22:26.560
Oh, it's Liam.

22:26.610 --> 22:29.431
- 'Hey, you got a minute?‘
- Sure, what's up?

22:29.480 --> 22:30.902
Why are you
unbuttoning your shirt?

22:30.950 --> 22:32.906
Uh, I have to go pick up
Jillian's mother at Logan

22:32.950 --> 22:35.839
and take her to this
trustee thing at the Gardner.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.747
Now officially a male escort
for 80-year-old cougars.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.417
- 'Um, Liam?‘
- Mm-hmm.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.429
I am not _alone.
Hanna and Emily are here.

22:43.460 --> 22:45.155
Oh!

22:45.190 --> 22:47.829
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

22:47.860 --> 22:49.896
(Liam on laptop)
'I just wanted to give you
a quick update.‘

22:49.930 --> 22:52.660
Um, Jillian said if she doesn't
have something from Fitz

22:52.700 --> 22:54.691
by tomorrow, she's moving on.

22:54.740 --> 22:55.559
What? Why?

22:55.600 --> 22:57.431
She left me this
long message saying that

22:57.470 --> 22:59.438
he was a fraud
and he was two months away

22:59.470 --> 23:01.131
'from teaching creative writing
on a cruise ship.‘

23:01.180 --> 23:03.478
Okay. Well, she's wrong.

23:05.180 --> 23:07.546
She'll have something
on her desk by tomorrow.

23:07.580 --> 23:09.673
Will you tell her that, please?

23:10.890 --> 23:13.142
[sighs]
Yeah.

23:13.190 --> 23:15.078
I miss you.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.384
I miss you too.

23:21.130 --> 23:22.757
What?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.722
Why are you worried
about his book?

23:24.770 --> 23:27.830
Those are words. Who cares
about the stuff he makes up?

23:27.870 --> 23:29.428
Why don't you ask him
for the truth

23:29.470 --> 23:30.607
about the night
Charlotte was killed?

23:30.640 --> 23:31.709
[cell phone beeps]

23:31.740 --> 23:33.469
- What was that?
- Timer.

23:33.510 --> 23:34.602
On my phone.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.107
My mom asked me to meet her.

23:36.140 --> 23:38.404
I've to use the bathroom.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.578
[sighs]

23:42.620 --> 23:45.088
What are you gonna say
if the police call you in?

23:45.120 --> 23:46.712
Are you telling them
that you met up with Fitz?

23:46.750 --> 23:49.753
No, I was asleep
the whole time, remember?

23:55.060 --> 23:56.493
Oh, Hanna, no, no.

23:56.530 --> 23:58.691
Please drop that in the kitchen.

24:14.150 --> 24:17.449
[dramatic music]

24:29.860 --> 24:31.521
Hey, are you
getting out of here?

24:31.570 --> 24:35.028
Yeah. I just have a few
work e-mails to deal with.

24:36.900 --> 24:39.630
Emily, I saw you
in the bathroom.

24:42.540 --> 24:44.974
I don't know what you mean.

24:45.010 --> 24:48.047
Em, it's me.

24:52.650 --> 24:55.710
[sighs]
Are you sick?

24:55.760 --> 24:56.852
No.

24:59.330 --> 25:01.594
I'm broke.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.598
What-what about
the Salk Institute?

25:03.630 --> 25:05.598
It's not real.

25:05.630 --> 25:08.064
I mean, the place is,
I just..

25:08.100 --> 25:10.068
I don't have a job there.

25:10.100 --> 25:11.761
What's going on?

25:12.910 --> 25:13.979
[sighs]

25:17.880 --> 25:20.542
The last couple of years
have just been a lot harder

25:20.580 --> 25:22.639
than I made them sound.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.089
I left school

25:25.120 --> 25:27.850
and I blew through all the money
that my dad left me.

25:29.760 --> 25:30.988
And that's why
when one of the girls

25:31.030 --> 25:32.986
that I bartend with
told me about it..

25:33.030 --> 25:34.918
Told you about what?

25:37.700 --> 25:39.691
Donating my eggs.

25:41.040 --> 25:44.100
Wait. That's what
the injections are for?

25:45.810 --> 25:49.871
You have to take a lot of
hormones before the procedure.

25:49.910 --> 25:51.946
That's why
I'm havin' it done here.

25:51.980 --> 25:55.143
Em, you don't have to do this.
I'll lend you--

25:55.180 --> 25:57.546
No. No, it's okay.

25:58.220 --> 26:00.142
I want to.

26:00.190 --> 26:02.249
I mean..

26:02.290 --> 26:05.123
[sighs]
For the first time in forever

26:05.160 --> 26:08.721
I actually feel good
about a choice I've made.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.621
I'm gonna help
two people start a family.

26:17.770 --> 26:20.261
I just wish
you would have told me sooner.

26:20.310 --> 26:22.574
I didn't know how.

26:24.280 --> 26:26.271
Well, whoever they are..

26:26.310 --> 26:30.144
...they are the luckiest couple
in the world.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.361
[keys clacking]

26:57.010 --> 26:58.671
So you reached out to a friend

26:58.710 --> 27:00.814
you hadn't seen in,
what, five years?

27:02.080 --> 27:04.742
Lucas and I were close.

27:04.790 --> 27:08.248
And were any of the others
awake for this 3 am. snack?

27:08.290 --> 27:09.882
No, I mean, I'm the only one

27:09.920 --> 27:13.151
_ who even eats_
fried mozzarella sticks.

27:13.190 --> 27:16.648
Do you mind ifI invite
someone else to join us?

27:19.800 --> 27:22.064
Can you come in here, please?

27:29.840 --> 27:31.273
Maybe you can help us.

27:31.310 --> 27:32.379
'Hanna doesn't seem to recall'

27:32.410 --> 27:33.877
'letting you into the hotel.‘

27:33.920 --> 27:35.410
She didn't,
there was another guest

27:35.450 --> 27:37.247
leaving as I got there.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.714
Can you describe this guest?

27:39.750 --> 27:42.184
Uh, a man.

27:42.220 --> 27:45.656
I didn't get a good look. My
hands were full of greasy bags.

27:46.860 --> 27:48.418
Why were you so eager
to drop off food

27:48.460 --> 27:50.189
in the middle of the night?

27:50.230 --> 27:51.868
Hanna called

27:51.900 --> 27:55.028
and I was happy
to hear her voice.

27:55.070 --> 27:56.890
And she sounded a
little tipsy, so I thought that

27:56.940 --> 27:58.362
maybe we
could have little bit of fun.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.833
Talking. He means talking.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.279
We talked until the sun came up.

28:02.310 --> 28:05.746
Mm. Now were you
drinking alcohol too?

28:05.780 --> 28:08.146
Nope. Ice water.

28:08.180 --> 28:09.818
Was it in the room?

28:09.850 --> 28:10.919
I would've thought
that ice set out

28:10.950 --> 28:13.009
at turn-down would have melted.

28:13.050 --> 28:15.883
- I went to get more.
- So you left the room?

28:15.920 --> 28:18.388
Just a walk down the hall
to the ice machine.

28:18.430 --> 28:20.022
Was it down the hall?

28:20.060 --> 28:21.823
'Cause according to my records,
Radley doesn't have

28:21.860 --> 28:24.192
an ice closet
on the third floor.

28:32.440 --> 28:35.432
Melissa, what's wrong?

28:35.480 --> 28:37.971
[sighs]
I am an idiot.

28:38.010 --> 28:41.411
I totally botched things
with that reporter from Hollis.

28:41.450 --> 28:43.987
With Damian?
You talked to him?

28:44.020 --> 28:45.317
I wouldn't exactly
call it talking.

28:45.350 --> 28:47.750
More like nervous blurting.

28:47.790 --> 28:50.486
Okay. What did you blurt?

28:50.520 --> 28:51.919
Everything was going fine

28:51.960 --> 28:53.279
but then he got up
to take a phone call

28:53.330 --> 28:55.753
and when he came back,
his questions changed.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.893
And I saw words
written on his pad.

28:57.930 --> 29:00.023
- What were the words?
- I could only make out a few.

29:00.070 --> 29:02.538
But they really freaked me out.

29:02.570 --> 29:05.960
Source, cover-up and tape.

29:06.010 --> 29:08.501
Whatever happened
to that tape I made you?

29:08.540 --> 29:12.044
The one where I talked about the
night that Alison disappeared?

29:12.080 --> 29:14.241
Oh, my God, Melissa.
It's-it's gone. It's gone!

29:54.260 --> 29:55.352

29:55.390 --> 29:57.551
to the question
I asked you yesterday.

29:57.590 --> 29:59.421
Why are you here?

29:59.460 --> 30:03.351
The police asked me to stay.
I might be able to help.

30:03.400 --> 30:04.958
I'm talking about the funeral.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.298
If Charlotte was as horrible
as you told the judge she was

30:07.330 --> 30:10.060
why did you go?
Did you lie in court?

30:10.100 --> 30:12.159
Was it all an act, so you could
walk out like a victim?

30:12.210 --> 30:14.929
I'm luclq I was able
to walk out of there at all.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.847
What's that supposed to mean?

30:17.880 --> 30:20.178
I don't know about the others

30:20.210 --> 30:22.371
but I know
you feel guilty, Emily.

30:22.420 --> 30:25.389
Guilty? I have nothing
to feel guilty about.

30:27.450 --> 30:28.917
Should I take these gloves off?

30:28.960 --> 30:31.224
Sara, I couldn't have
done anything, okay?

30:31.260 --> 30:34.093
None of us could.
It all happened so quick..

30:38.930 --> 30:40.932
Who are you trying to convince?

30:40.970 --> 30:42.289
Me or you?

30:49.980 --> 30:51.208
[knock on door]

30:53.150 --> 30:54.617
We need to talk,
the others are on their way

30:54.650 --> 30:55.912
and we can't do this
in front of them.

30:55.950 --> 30:57.178
- What others?
- Look, Ezra.

30:57.220 --> 30:58.482
I know you're lost right now.

30:58.520 --> 30:59.942
I know you are, you're filled

30:59.990 --> 31:01.287
with anger
and you're full of despair--

31:01.320 --> 31:02.514
Well, what the hell
are you talking about?

31:02.560 --> 31:04.323
Charlotte!

31:04.360 --> 31:07.352
For God's sake,
don't make me say it, Ezra!

31:09.000 --> 31:11.298
Look, I know why
you did what you did

31:11.330 --> 31:14.367
and I will do whatever
it takes to help you.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.061
I swear if you want me
to lie for you, I will.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.931
I know that you did this
to protect me.

[knock on door]

31:19.210 --> 31:20.632
Oh, God. Now don't,
don't answer it.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.228
Not yet.

31:25.010 --> 31:27.149
Is she already here?

31:27.180 --> 31:29.375
Do come in. Join the party.

31:32.990 --> 31:35.083
Anybody bring torches,
pitchforks?

31:35.120 --> 31:36.951
Anything like that?

31:38.260 --> 31:40.285
You didn't protect Aria, okay?

31:40.330 --> 31:41.649
- I protected Aria!
- 'Hanna--'

31:41.700 --> 31:43.292
And we are not gonna
go down for this

31:43.330 --> 31:44.991
because you thought that
you had to slay the dragon!

31:45.030 --> 31:46.497
- Hanna, please--
- What?

31:46.530 --> 31:48.066
My mom may go down for this too.

31:48.100 --> 31:49.431
He needs to own up
to what he did!

31:49.470 --> 31:51.062
Hanna, just let me talk.

31:51.110 --> 31:54.079
Look, you can say
that it was self-defense.

31:54.110 --> 31:55.577
Charlotte had a very
long history of throwing

31:55.610 --> 31:57.635
the first punch and nobody
would ever question you.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.399
They can't! You seem to
already have all the answers.

32:00.450 --> 32:03.339
Ezra, it wasn't just some
random car that hit her, okay?

32:03.380 --> 32:05.348
Somebody planned this
to make it look like she jumped.

32:05.390 --> 32:08.086
And you might have already
had that plan in your head.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.213
That paper that I wrote,
"Texas vs. Kellner."

32:10.260 --> 32:12.228
'You read it the summer
before I published it'

32:12.260 --> 32:14.956
when we met up at DuPont Circle
right before your reading.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.695
Okay. It's time
for you to leave.

32:19.730 --> 32:21.698
Not until you're honest with us.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.469
Honest, Emily?

32:23.500 --> 32:25.468
You are not asking me
to change your grade

32:25.510 --> 32:28.206
you are asking me
to confess to a murder.

32:28.240 --> 32:31.107
Where did you go that night
after you left Aria?

32:32.750 --> 32:34.172
Why the hell can't you tell us?

32:34.220 --> 32:36.017
- Emily, leave him alone.
- Why?

32:36.050 --> 32:37.415
Sara Harvey
won't leave us alone.

32:37.450 --> 32:40.544
She's sticking around
Rosewood to punish us, Aria!

32:40.590 --> 32:42.114
(Emily)
'And she will use
this against us'

32:42.160 --> 32:43.309
until it looks like
we planned this and Ezra

32:43.360 --> 32:45.351
just carried out our wishes!

32:45.390 --> 32:47.381
It's time to go.

32:48.630 --> 32:52.589
Now! Get out!

32:52.630 --> 32:54.234
Okay. We're gonna leave.

32:54.270 --> 32:56.090
But you two better
figure this out

32:56.140 --> 32:58.233
before the police do.

33:09.080 --> 33:11.344
- You need to leave too.
- Ezra?

33:11.390 --> 33:13.688
How long have you known me?

33:13.720 --> 33:16.109
Who do you think I am? Hmm?

33:17.360 --> 33:19.055
I don't know.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.620
You're not the same person
I said goodbye to

33:23.660 --> 33:25.628
in front of The Brew
that summer.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.194
You're right.

33:27.230 --> 33:30.233
And I'm not going to
pretend that I am sorry

33:30.270 --> 33:32.261
that the person who made
your life a living hell

33:32.310 --> 33:34.631
who tormented you
five years later

33:34.680 --> 33:36.773
I am not going to say
I'm sorry that they are dead

33:36.810 --> 33:39.074
'cause I am not.

33:49.660 --> 33:52.185
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:55.530 --> 33:57.748
- Were you waiting up for me?
- No.

33:57.800 --> 34:00.360
I was just reading

34:00.400 --> 34:03.267
"The Gardener's
Desk Reference."

34:06.610 --> 34:09.204
Where have you been?

34:09.240 --> 34:10.639
Are you okay?

34:10.680 --> 34:12.648
Yeah, I'm just..

34:12.680 --> 34:15.171
I met up with Hanna and Emily.

34:16.820 --> 34:20.586
Um, when you first heard that

34:20.620 --> 34:22.713
Charlotte was killed

34:22.760 --> 34:25.320
where did your mind go?

34:25.360 --> 34:27.521
You mean as in like who did it?

34:29.430 --> 34:32.558
I mean, Sara Harvey
was pretty high on that list.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.864
- Why?
- I don't think that she did it.

34:34.900 --> 34:38.233
But...I do think that
she remembers more

34:38.270 --> 34:40.135
than she's letting on.

34:40.170 --> 34:41.671
I'm not following.

34:41.710 --> 34:43.507
Hanna really didn't tell you?

34:43.540 --> 34:45.098
Tell me what?

34:45.150 --> 34:47.505
About what happened
the night of the prom.

34:47.550 --> 34:49.848
When we went to
Radley and we met

34:49.880 --> 34:51.245
Ali on the roof to try to stop--

34:51.290 --> 34:54.384
Everyone knows that.
E-even the cops.

34:54.420 --> 34:57.412
Yeah, but something
happened before that..

34:57.460 --> 35:00.156
...that nobody knows about.

35:00.190 --> 35:02.329
She's headed to the roof.
Please help me!

35:02.360 --> 35:05.261
- Hey!
- I tried to keep you safe.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.158
[electricity crackling]

35:09.200 --> 35:11.361
- Oh, my God!
- Stop. Don't touch her.

35:12.710 --> 35:13.699
. (Spencer)
Oh, my God!'

35:13.740 --> 35:15.139
[Sara gasping]

35:18.910 --> 35:21.617
You were given
an impossible choice.

35:21.650 --> 35:23.538
Yeah, I know, that's..

35:23.580 --> 35:26.287
That's what I always try
to tell myself, but..

35:27.790 --> 35:30.179
...what if that's not true?

35:32.760 --> 35:35.320
What if all of those years

35:35.360 --> 35:39.296
of being stalked and tortured..

35:39.330 --> 35:41.469
...what if that hardened me?

35:42.370 --> 35:43.894
Like maybe it happened so slowly

35:43.940 --> 35:45.828
that I don't even know
that it was happening.

35:45.870 --> 35:49.169
Hey, listen to me.

35:51.210 --> 35:53.747
You are a good person.

35:53.780 --> 35:56.544
Yes, you are.

35:56.580 --> 35:59.287
And you, you wear your heart
on your sleeve.

36:00.820 --> 36:04.779
It just happens to be
the sleeve of a flak jacket.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.754
[laughing]

36:14.900 --> 36:16.834
[car door closes]

36:16.870 --> 36:18.337
[car beeps]

36:23.640 --> 36:25.676
- Hi.
- Hey.

36:25.710 --> 36:27.644
Sorry, I didn't call, I..

36:28.820 --> 36:30.412
Come, sit.

36:32.790 --> 36:34.485
[sighs]

36:36.260 --> 36:38.558
I want you
to promise me something.

36:38.590 --> 36:41.229
Mom, it's been a really
long day. I just--

36:41.260 --> 36:44.866
I never want you to go
through something alone.

36:44.900 --> 36:46.959
We can go through it together.

36:48.900 --> 36:50.538
Promise?

36:51.540 --> 36:52.632
Yeah.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.009
- Did you get my messages?
- Yeah.

37:01.050 --> 37:03.678
I had no right
to ask you to do that.

37:07.820 --> 37:09.788
You don't have to answer me

37:09.820 --> 37:11.959
but did you have something
to do with Alison's sister

37:11.990 --> 37:13.924
falling off that bell tower?

37:13.960 --> 37:15.552
No.

37:19.300 --> 37:21.791
You're braver than my mom.

37:21.840 --> 37:25.662
She's been wanting to ask me
the same thing, but..

37:25.710 --> 37:28.531
...I think
she's scared of the answer.

37:30.040 --> 37:33.703
She can barely look at me.

37:33.750 --> 37:38.312
Waking up in my old room gets
harder and harder every day.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.680
[keys jingling]

37:46.090 --> 37:47.387
What's this for?

37:47.430 --> 37:50.649
I've to go off
to San Jose tomorrow.

37:50.700 --> 37:53.396
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you want.

38:00.770 --> 38:02.476
Have you eaten?

38:05.810 --> 38:08.745
[cell phone ringing]

38:10.450 --> 38:12.418
[sniffles]
Hello.

38:12.450 --> 38:14.714
You okay? Did I wake you?

38:14.760 --> 38:17.081
No. No. What's up?

38:17.120 --> 38:19.657
Um, you know,
those chapters you sent?

38:19.690 --> 38:21.954
[chuckles]
Jillian ate them up.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.821
She devoured them like
the carnivore she denies she is.

38:24.870 --> 38:25.791
Wait.

38:25.830 --> 38:29.493
She read them already?
And she liked them?

38:29.540 --> 38:31.804
You're officially
The Book Whisperer.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.762
Wh-what do you mean?

38:33.810 --> 38:36.574
(Liam on phone)
'Whatever you're doing,
just keep doing it.'

38:40.750 --> 38:41.910
Thank you..

38:42.980 --> 38:45.312
...for not judging me.

38:46.920 --> 38:50.686
I just wish
you hadn't judged yourself.

38:50.720 --> 38:51.823
[chuckles]

39:06.410 --> 39:07.866
There's, um..

39:10.140 --> 39:12.347
There's something else..

39:13.580 --> 39:16.572
...that I've been
judging myself for.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.549
* Love

39:58.590 --> 40:03.857
* Is a burning flame

40:03.900 --> 40:07.097
* And it makes

40:07.130 --> 40:10.463
* A fiery ring

40:12.640 --> 40:15.131
* Bound

40:15.180 --> 40:20.573
* By wild desire

40:20.610 --> 40:24.979
* I fell into a ring of fire

40:27.890 --> 40:31.587
* I fell into

40:31.630 --> 40:34.827
* A burning ring of fire

40:34.860 --> 40:38.864
* I went down down down

40:38.900 --> 40:43.030
* But the flames went higher

40:43.070 --> 40:46.858
* And it burns

40:46.910 --> 40:48.502
[cell phone beeps]

40:48.540 --> 40:52.670
* The ring of fire

40:52.710 --> 40:56.578
* The ring of fire

41:13.030 --> 41:15.828
* I fell into

41:15.870 --> 41:18.566
* A burning ring of fire..

41:18.610 --> 41:19.668
[cell phone vibrating]

41:19.710 --> 41:23.237
* I went down down down

41:23.280 --> 41:24.679
* And the flames went higher..

41:24.710 --> 41:26.541
[cell phone beeps]

41:27.180 --> 41:32.948
* And it burns

41:32.990 --> 41:33.911
[cell phone beeps]

41:36.290 --> 41:39.657
* And the ring of fire

41:40.630 --> 41:46.728
* And it burns

41:46.770 --> 41:50.729
* The ring of fire

41:50.770 --> 41:54.501
* The ring of fire *

42:06.690 --> 42:08.783
[keys clacking]

42:17.630 --> 42:20.758
