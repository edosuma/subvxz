00:02.160 --> 00:03.889
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:04.200 --> 00:07.841
<i>After five years in hell,
I returned home with only one goal,</i>

00:08.080 --> 00:09.570
<i>to save my city.</i>

00:09.840 --> 00:11.444
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.</i>

00:11.760 --> 00:13.364
<i>I had to become someone else.</i>

00:13.920 --> 00:16.286
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

00:16.600 --> 00:19.206
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

00:20.120 --> 00:21.451
Previously on Arrow...

00:22.440 --> 00:24.920
I'm not gonna kill you.
But you need to trust me,

00:25.120 --> 00:26.121
or we're both dead.

00:26.280 --> 00:29.443
What this city needs is someone willing to
stand up in the light of day,

00:29.680 --> 00:31.284
not a guy lurking around in the shadows.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.289
I'm going to run for mayor.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.247
What a pleasant surprise.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.925
I want you to bring my sister
back to life.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.963
<i>Even if Sara went into the Pit,
even if it worked,</i>

00:39.440 --> 00:41.204
what came out of the Pit
would not be Sara.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.965
<i>"MALCOLM". We are in uncharted waters here.</i>

00:47.240 --> 00:49.641
I suggest you prepare yourself
for the worst.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.250
Leave a couple of those
on the table, Junie.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.764
Thought you said
we're delivering 40 kilos.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.645
So they'll get 38.
Dumbasses can't count, anyways.

01:04.319 --> 01:07.005
- Get out! Now! Now! Now!
- S.C.P.D.! On the ground!

01:13.960 --> 01:14.961
<i>Clear!</i>

01:15.160 --> 01:17.288
- MALE SWAT <i>11 Clear!</i>
<i>- All clear!</i>

01:20.480 --> 01:21.970
We're good to go here.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.845
S.C.P.D., hands in the air!

01:25.680 --> 01:27.682
Relax. We got this.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.765
What're you guys doing here?

01:30.120 --> 01:31.849
We didn't hear a call for ESU go out.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.529
You guys
aren't supposed to be here, either.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.771
Well, we got a tip from one of our Cls.

01:44.320 --> 01:45.526
Sons of bitches.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.521
Let's go.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.643
Well, this is horrible.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.645
What type of secret lair has windows?

02:06.880 --> 02:10.645
Well, you know, Oliver said
he wanted to do things differently.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.849
I think I just saw a cockroach.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.649
Listen, about Oliver...

02:18.040 --> 02:19.724
Oh, no. Look, it's fine, he

02:20.240 --> 02:22.208
still thinks
we spent the weekend at a spa.

02:22.680 --> 02:26.082
But why can't we tell him about Sara?

02:26.240 --> 02:27.810
Sara, she needs more time.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.202
And I don't need Oliver's judgment.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.246
Just a couple more days,
and she'll be back to herself.

02:34.040 --> 02:35.041
I promise.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.927
Guessing he didn't tell you
what we're doing here, either.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.925
No. He just had a perma-grin on his face
the whole way here.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.366
Okay, now I'm worried.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.244
He said he has some big announcement
to make.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.931
Oh, my God, wait.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.528
Where is it? Why aren't you wearing it?

02:51.600 --> 02:52.726
Wearing what?

02:53.240 --> 02:54.446
Uh...

02:55.840 --> 02:58.081
What is it that you wanted to tell us?

02:58.840 --> 03:01.446
And why are you telling us here?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.443
- Remember this office?
- Yes.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.604
This was
Sebastian Blood's campaign office.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.285
And now it's mine.

03:10.120 --> 03:13.522
Anyone who's qualified is afraid to run,
for good reason.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.246
But I can protect myself.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.089
So, I'm running for mayor.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.285
Uh, don't everyone
congratulate me at once.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.805
- Oh, you're serious?
- Yes.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.248
The other week, Lance was saying
that this

03:29.960 --> 03:33.487
city needs someone to stand up,
who isn't hiding behind a mask.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.087
- It needs a leader.
- But why does that person have to be you?

03:36.560 --> 03:38.801
I mean, don't get me wrong,
but you're not a politician.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.566
Well, maybe that's the best reason
for me to be elected.

03:41.760 --> 03:46.129
What are you going to do for a staff,
or campaign manager, money?

03:46.320 --> 03:47.481
The money part's taken care of.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.930
Palmer Tech has funded enough
to kick-start the campaign.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.290
The decision I'm sure
my Board of Directors

03:53.440 --> 03:54.487
are gonna be thrilled with.

03:54.640 --> 03:55.801
What platform are you gonna run on?

03:56.240 --> 03:59.449
- I'll figure it out.
- What qualifies you to be mayor?

03:59.600 --> 04:00.965
I care about this city.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.849
But you can't say that you're gonna run

04:03.080 --> 04:04.684
because being the Green Arrow
isn't enough.

04:04.920 --> 04:06.285
I'm working on that.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.164
We need to brush up on those answers
before the first press conference.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.651
Obviously.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.525
Kind of thought everyone would
be a little bit more supportive.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.524
It's not that
we're not supportive, Oliver.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.920
- It's just...
- We just want to make sure

04:19.079 --> 04:20.684
- that you're not in over your head.
- Yeah.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.525
Maybe the other announcement
will go over better.

04:23.840 --> 04:24.921
Okay.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.281
For real?

04:46.360 --> 04:48.806
There's a reason we had Felicity
buy Blood's campaign office.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.684
Blood also needed his own lair.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.970
But don't worry,
I burned a lot of incense.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.881
- Oliver, how did you...
- How did you do this all by yourself?

05:08.040 --> 05:11.726
- Well, I had help.
- He had a lot of help.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.561
Cisco and S.T.A.R. Labs.

05:15.560 --> 05:16.925
Four polycarbonate cases,

05:17.080 --> 05:19.526
each keyed to your individual biometrics.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.924
God, I didn't even think
you could pronounce biometrics.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.730
I had some design input.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.201
Wow!

05:27.080 --> 05:28.525
Oliver, this is amazing.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.089
Well, when I set up shop in the foundry,
it was just me.

05:32.240 --> 05:35.369
That's not the case anymore, so I thought
we could use a little more space.

05:35.680 --> 05:38.251
What was that? Did it break?

05:39.320 --> 05:40.765
- Oh.
- You okay?

05:40.920 --> 05:42.763
Yeah, I'm just not used to this chair yet.

05:43.080 --> 05:46.721
I'm feeding police emergency services and
Homeland Security radio transmissions

05:46.920 --> 05:48.763
through a processing algorithm, 24/7.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.243
This way, if anything happens in the city,
we will know about it.

05:54.240 --> 05:57.289
Two police detectives found shot to death
responding to a code three.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.284
Um, there's no record of them
calling dispatch for backup.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.602
Which means either their comms failed,
or they were ambushed

06:02.760 --> 06:03.921
the moment they arrived on the scene.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.605
Thea and I will do recon.
See if there's anything

06:05.800 --> 06:07.290
the CSI missed at the crime scene.

06:07.520 --> 06:08.760
Right. I'll talk to Lance.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.803
Maybe skip the part
about running for mayor

06:10.960 --> 06:12.644
because I'm pretty sure
you're not gonna have his vote.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.086
That'll have to change.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.641
Can't run the city
without the help of the S.C.P.D.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.441
- Okay.
- Hmm.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.282
What did Thea think that you were wearing?

06:23.120 --> 06:24.451
Noidea.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.883
Fast track ballistics and have
CSI dust every shell casing for latents.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.804
Hey, Forensics recovered this. SIM card.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.491
Probably belongs to one of the doers,

06:32.640 --> 06:34.642
but CSU says they need 48 hours
to get a full work-up.

06:34.960 --> 06:38.487
What? How is evidence from a crime scene
where two detectives were killed

06:38.640 --> 06:40.005
not a top priority?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.731
We don't have the manpower.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.961
You spend more time here now
than when you were getting collared

06:47.160 --> 06:49.322
- for hitting paparazzi.
- You have a moment for me?

06:50.120 --> 06:51.167
Yeah.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.922
So these visits,
are they gonna be a weekly thing?

06:55.080 --> 06:56.684
Well, I was just trying to help with...

06:58.160 --> 06:59.685
- What's that?
- I wouldn't know.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.843
City Hall has cut my budget so tight,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.128
I can't get evidence turned around
before I'm 80.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.521
I'm hoping that's something
I might be able to help with eventually.

07:06.840 --> 07:09.002
- Yeah?
- I've decided to run for mayor.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.850
- Really?
- And I know it's a long-shot,

07:13.000 --> 07:14.923
but it would mean a lot
if you would endorse my candidacy.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.207
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.600
After what happened
to the last few mayors,

07:17.760 --> 07:19.125
I'm hoping you win in a landslide.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.363
Till then,
I'm trying to catch a cop killer

07:23.640 --> 07:26.211
and I don't have time to wait
for my under-staffed crime lab.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.521
I want you to wait until nightfall
to light a fire.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.371
Okay? Otherwise,
you're gonna draw attention. All right.

07:39.040 --> 07:42.203
There's fresh water coming off a stream
at the base of the hill.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.403
There's edible plants, maybe 50 feet
to the north.

07:44.560 --> 07:49.646
Just... Hey. Do not eat the red berries.
And do not let anyone see you.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.563
Why are you doing this?
Risking your life, to save mine.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.410
It's complicated.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.723
They may think I'm dead, but
they're going to come looking for you...

07:58.880 --> 08:00.848
They're not gonna come looking for me.
I'm going back to camp.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.320
I've watched those men.

08:02.720 --> 08:06.008
They are like brothers to each other.
They have a history. A bond.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.045
You are not one of them.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.243
That's why you're gonna have to
do something for me.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.490
And you're not gonna like it.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.004
All right, so I figured it out.

08:20.360 --> 08:23.045
It's Neal Adams in data processing.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.602
He won the archery medal
three years running at a summer camp,

08:25.880 --> 08:28.451
he has a problem with his temper,
and he likes the color green.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.364
Right. You think that Neal Adams
is the Green Arrow?

08:30.560 --> 08:32.528
- He's 5'2".
- Lifts?

08:32.679 --> 08:35.081
I am not telling you who he is.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.885
Oh, and B-T-dubb, next time you want to
prank your boss, worst career move,

08:38.039 --> 08:39.769
but whatevs,
you might wanna try a little harder.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.284
And you lost me.

08:42.120 --> 08:45.090
- I've been receiving these all week.
- Okay, well, I didn't send this.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.442
And trust me, if I were gonna prank you,
I'd be a lot more creative.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.125
This code is from 2013.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.282
But the IP address
is coming from Palmer Tech,

08:51.520 --> 08:53.204
from a terminal here, in your workspace.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.127
I believe the term is,
"You are so busted."

08:57.280 --> 09:00.284
I'm not busted. I can't be busted.
I didn't send you two-year-old code.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.965
Though it is elegant.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.961
And familiar.

09:07.960 --> 09:11.646
I was going through some of Mr. Palmer's
old prototypes, and I found this.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.930
Yeah, that was Ray's.
I mean, Mr. Palmer's.

09:15.320 --> 09:18.085
I mean, this has code that's, like,
identical to what you have on the phone.

09:18.280 --> 09:21.124
I mean, the question is,
why is Mr. Palmer's prototype OS

09:21.320 --> 09:23.084
sending you texts in your phone?

09:25.800 --> 09:27.404
Ray must have connected
the prototype's computer

09:27.560 --> 09:29.005
to the company's Local Area Network.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.169
He did. it uploaded a crash log.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.926
I mean, the equipment's programed
to record the user's voice

09:34.080 --> 09:35.491
right before a fatal malfunction.

09:36.440 --> 09:37.680
Sorry.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.164
Poor choice of words.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.802
The... The point is, is that
Mr. Palmer's last recorded statement

09:44.000 --> 09:45.650
could shed some light on how he died.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.611
Except that it's password protected.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.650
I already know how he died.
I don't need to relive it.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.441
- Bub-
- But“

09:52.600 --> 09:55.171
Ray and I were close.
We were, um, friends.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.962
He died six months ago, I don't
really want to open that particular wound.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.445
- It did it again?
- No. Different mystery.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.681
Lance gave us a SIM card
recovered from the crime scene.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.281
Where's Laurel?

10:15.440 --> 10:17.283
Said she had something
she needed to deal with.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.281
Ah, it's a good thing you guys
aren't short-handed these days.

10:20.720 --> 10:24.486
This SIM card isn't from a cell phone.
Looks like some kind of walkie with GPS.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.371
GPS as in we can track it?

10:26.560 --> 10:28.210
As in, I can figure out
all the places it's been

10:28.360 --> 10:32.888
and triangulate from there
to determine, hmm, where it came from.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.167
Gear up.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.883
- Fifth floor is clear.
- Yeah, this place is completely empty.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.964
I think I found something. Third floor.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.400
Headed your way.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.008
Every door here is open or unlocked.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.206
Except for this one.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.568
- Clear.
- It's not empty.

11:08.080 --> 11:11.766
M-Fours, there's Kevlar,
Flashbang grenades...

11:11.920 --> 11:13.001
Some of this stuff is military grade.

11:13.160 --> 11:15.367
What, do you think
we found the Ghost armory?

11:17.440 --> 11:18.566
No.

11:18.720 --> 11:22.441
- Wait...
- Star City Police Department.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.685
The people who killed those detectives
were police officers.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.445
All right. All right, I'll bite.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.726
- What are we doing down in your basement?
- It's better if I just show you.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.450
After what happened between us last year,

11:41.600 --> 11:43.762
I swore that I would never keep secrets
from you again.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.962
Especially when it has to do
with our family.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.567
Family? Oh, my...

11:51.800 --> 11:52.801
Baby?

12:00.760 --> 12:01.761
How's...

12:02.280 --> 12:04.169
How is this even possible?

12:04.600 --> 12:05.886
<i>"LAUREL". The League of Assassins.</i>

12:06.240 --> 12:07.651
They have something called
the Lazarus Pit.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.645
- It can bring someone back from the dead.
- Back, from what? From the...

12:11.880 --> 12:13.564
This isn't back, Laurel. Look at her.

12:13.760 --> 12:16.001
- Look at my baby. I don't...
- Dad, she's alive.

12:17.240 --> 12:18.844
Your daughter is alive.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.610
This isn't my daughter.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.165
Daddy, it is, she's just been gone
for a really long time.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.081
It's okay.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.011
She'll remember who she is.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.851
We just have to be patient,

12:36.600 --> 12:38.364
and we'll help her find her way, right?

12:41.920 --> 12:43.160
Do you remember me?

12:44.680 --> 12:46.762
I'm Laurel. Your sister?

12:47.520 --> 12:49.807
Look. There's me.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.283
Then, this is you. Do you see that?

12:53.840 --> 12:55.524
Yeah? And who's that?

12:57.280 --> 12:58.691
Is that Daddy?

13:02.600 --> 13:05.171
We're your family. We love you.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.126
Who am I?

13:12.960 --> 13:15.042
She's speaking because she's remembering.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.521
Let me go. Let me go!

13:18.160 --> 13:19.207
Laurel!

13:23.120 --> 13:24.690
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.687
She just... She needs more time.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.691
I think you better add
"Get an entirely new police force"

13:33.840 --> 13:36.411
- to your campaign platform.
- It's not the entire force.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.643
But, yeah,
we don't know who's compromised.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.006
Well, except for Captain Lance.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.924
Yeah, well,
Captain Lance is MIA right now.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.162
I think it's safe to assume that
whatever help we're going to get

13:45.320 --> 13:47.209
- is right here, in this room.
- I'm working on something.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.882
Oh, Cisco said we were still working out
some of the kinks.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.731
In the last two months, there's been
a huge spike on gangs stealing

13:54.000 --> 13:56.401
- drug shipments from other gangs.
- Yeah, but it's not these gangs.

13:56.600 --> 13:57.601
It was these bad cops.

13:57.760 --> 14:00.570
Who steal the drugs to sell them back
to the gangbangers they stole them from.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.091
So these corrupt cops are taking down

14:02.240 --> 14:03.765
- big drug scores.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.089
- Let's give them one.
- How?

14:06.360 --> 14:08.522
That depends on how close you are
with your former drug dealer.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.202
Depends which one.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.207
- We're going to need some money.
- Don't you mean more money?

14:17.040 --> 14:18.121
Mmm-hmm.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.281
Queenie.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.646
I haven't seen you in forever.
This your boyfriend?

14:30.800 --> 14:32.131
Bodyguard.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.887
Didn't realize the Queens could afford
that kind of help these days.

14:35.040 --> 14:39.568
Well, I recently came into my inheritance,
and was hoping to throw a party with it.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.642
- So you can help me out?
- To the tune of...

14:42.880 --> 14:45.645
Eighty keys. You know how I like to party.

14:46.120 --> 14:49.408
I might have a hook-up.
But he doesn't take credit cards.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.810
Let me make a call.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.850
I've been trying to get in touch with you.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.809
Uh, yeah, phone's been off. What is it?

15:07.960 --> 15:09.769
You're gonna tell me
you're running for president now?

15:10.800 --> 15:12.848
Your detectives aren't dead
because of gang violence.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.808
- They were killed by cops.
- What are you talking about?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.604
The SIM card that you gave us,

15:18.760 --> 15:21.604
it led to the killer's armory,
and all the equipment, the weapons,

15:21.760 --> 15:23.330
it was all S.C.P.D. issue.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.082
- Who is it?
- It could be anyone in the department.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.484
These guys have been taking down
drug busts.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.802
So I've had Thea procure
a couple kilos of cocaine.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.287
Your mayoral campaign
is off to a fantastic start then.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.762
We're keeping the drugs
in a warehouse on Meldrum.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.282
I need you to subtly get the word out.

15:40.360 --> 15:41.361
All right.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.610
Listen... Wait, wait, wait.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.691
- I wanna be there when they show.
- I'm not sure that's a good idea.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.042
Yeah, well, I'm not sure
I really give a damn.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.328
Because, if I got bent cops
in my precinct,

15:52.480 --> 15:54.005
I'm gonna be there to bust 'em.

16:03.320 --> 16:06.210
- The hell happened to you?
- The woman tried to escape.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.844
We chased her,
but she went through a mine field.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.566
- Thought I heard an explosion earlier.
- That one got Richards.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.325
- Son of a bitch.
- I caught her.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.401
Eventually.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.246
Made it memorable.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.563
- What? I'm supposed to kill her, right?
- Her, yeah. Richards, not so much.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.246
- I didn't kill Richards. I told you...
- Yeah, landmine. I know.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.925
You know what's funny?

16:30.240 --> 16:32.004
We've been here months without a problem.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.771
And here you come, and two guys
get wasted by landmines.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.210
What's that supposed to mean?

16:37.760 --> 16:39.046
It means I want to see her.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.605
The woman. I want to see the body.

16:44.840 --> 16:45.921
Okay.

16:57.120 --> 16:58.770
I know this is a trap and all,

16:59.000 --> 17:02.368
but something about the drugs, the club...

17:02.920 --> 17:05.287
It makes me feel like
I'm back in high school again.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.281
What?

17:08.520 --> 17:10.807
Just thinking about how much I hate
raising a daughter in this city.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.046
Heads up. I'm reading a truck
closing in on your position.

17:14.359 --> 17:16.806
<i>The make matches the profile
for an ESU strike vehicle.</i>

17:16.960 --> 17:18.644
- Copy. We're ready.
- Two minutes out.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.446
Captain Lance.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.642
What, I don't get a code name
like the rest of you?

17:23.359 --> 17:25.282
Detective. Get ready.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.043
Targets on site. Let's go.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.049
We've got multiple tangos! Move!

18:28.280 --> 18:29.441
Move out!

18:49.280 --> 18:50.361
You Okay?

18:51.400 --> 18:54.051
The training, the equipment,
those were cops.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.646
And no, I'm not okay.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.482
You have got to be kidding me.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.481
Uh, no, um...

19:09.800 --> 19:12.644
Not to complain, but you do know
that you just brought a police captain

19:12.880 --> 19:14.245
into our secret lair?

19:14.400 --> 19:17.006
Don't worry.
I got enough to put you away for 25 years.

19:17.520 --> 19:18.885
Kidding.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.202
Captain Lance isn't the police
we should be worried about.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.685
Wow! No wonder
there's corruption on the force.

19:23.840 --> 19:25.251
Everyone else has got better resources.

19:25.480 --> 19:26.481
I don't know.

19:26.680 --> 19:29.251
Those ESU
had some pretty fancy toys tonight,

19:29.560 --> 19:32.040
that definitely weren't
standard police issue.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.607
Well, they were police issue, all right.
But just not standard.

19:35.160 --> 19:38.289
Those were specialized anti-vigilante
task force gear.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.010
I thought the task force was disbanded.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.921
Yeah. I might've reinstated that, uh,
last year.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.563
- How many officers are there?
- Forty or so.

19:46.760 --> 19:48.603
Well, that definitely narrows things down
a bit.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.046
We should check their conduct records.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.964
Maybe that will narrow it down
a little bit more.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.921
Yeah, that's gonna take
a little bit longer than usual.

19:56.200 --> 20:00.205
Well, I can give you unrestricted access
to the department's computer network.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.405
Might speed things up a little.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.125
I'll see what I can dig up
at the precinct.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.925
Looks like eighty keys here.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.203
Idiots baited the mouse trap
with real cheese.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.044
Because they knew
we'd sniff them out otherwise.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.323
Well, it's a good thing we decided
to pack the special gear.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.881
We weren't the only ones showing up
with a little surprise tonight.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.611
- Captain Lance?
- There's no way he didn't peg us as cops.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.602
- We got to take him out.
- We don't kill cops.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.888
Tell that to the two gold shields
we wasted last night.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.326
They were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.164
I'm not killing fellow officers
in cold blood.

20:36.440 --> 20:39.091
Our advantage was
the force thought we were gangbangers.

20:39.840 --> 20:40.966
We should put this to a vote.

20:42.120 --> 20:45.806
My vote's nine-millimeters
and the only one that counts.

20:46.800 --> 20:47.926
We are not criminals.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.489
Let's all just try to remember that.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.128
We went this route
because this city is dying,

20:53.320 --> 20:56.085
and we need to be able to provide
for our families.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.804
It still doesn't change the fact
that Lance is a problem.

21:01.320 --> 21:02.651
No. He's not.

21:04.440 --> 21:05.601
He's a solution.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.281
Curtis.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.329
There you are.
Why haven't you been answering my texts?

21:09.480 --> 21:13.166
Your texts were "9-1-1 OMG ASAP"
and five exclamation points.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.681
I do not have time to respond to something
that doesn't contain

21:15.840 --> 21:17.524
at least one actual word.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.690
I need your help
with Mr. Palmer's crash log.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.120
I thought I told you to let that go.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.886
Look, I've tried brute-forcing
the password, but nothing works.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.328
But there is a sub-kernel
that contains a programmer note.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.010
Oh, my God, this must be
what talking to me is like.

21:28.160 --> 21:31.482
And that programing note suggests that
you know the password.

21:31.880 --> 21:34.531
I mean, which makes sense, right,
you and Mr. Palmer were friends.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.522
- Yeah. I know the password.
- You do?

21:38.800 --> 21:40.404
- So tell it to me so we can just...
- No, I...

21:42.880 --> 21:45.724
I do not want to listen to a recording

21:45.880 --> 21:48.531
of my ex-boyfriend's
final moment before he died.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.244
You and Mr. Palmer were together?

21:55.040 --> 21:57.361
Now, do you understand why
I don't want to hear his voice?

21:59.880 --> 22:00.927
No.

22:03.880 --> 22:07.009
My brother died six years ago.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.685
Pancreatic cancer.

22:13.680 --> 22:17.241
To be able to hear something from him
I'd never heard before?

22:20.080 --> 22:21.764
God, I'd give anything.

22:31.560 --> 22:34.564
Captain Lance. What a pleasure it was
to receive your message.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.564
And for you to initiate contact, well,

22:36.920 --> 22:39.571
it made me feel like our relationship
took an important step forward.

22:39.760 --> 22:42.240
- I need your help.
- I'm sorry. Say that again?

22:42.560 --> 22:43.607
It's for my daughter.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.410
And not the one
that you're holding over me as leverage.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.289
Sara, the one you lost last year.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.081
Yeah, she's back.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.249
This thing called the Lazarus Pit.

22:51.720 --> 22:52.926
Sure you've heard of it.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.646
What, you did your homework on me,

22:54.800 --> 22:56.450
you don't think I did a little
digging around on you?

22:57.720 --> 22:59.370
You used to be a member
of The League of Assassins.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.409
What is it you want, Mr. Lance?

23:02.240 --> 23:03.401
She's my daughter.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.201
She's not right.
She's come back, and she's different.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.289
- She's crazy.
- It's a miracle she came back at all.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.924
It doesn't feel like a miracle, all right?

23:13.160 --> 23:15.083
Now, you know about this stuff.
Is there anything I can do?

23:15.240 --> 23:17.242
- Is there anything that you can do?
- I can give advice.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.091
Father to father.

23:19.480 --> 23:22.927
I can tell you that
if it were my daughter, I'd put her down.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.808
- She's my baby girl.
- No, she isn't.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.481
She may look like your daughter,
but she doesn't possess her soul.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.923
The most loving act you can commit

23:37.520 --> 23:39.284
is to return Sara to her final rest.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.241
I'm sorry.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.121
Oh!

23:58.600 --> 24:00.364
Oh, I'm so glad we came back.

24:04.680 --> 24:06.205
- You all right?
- Hmm?

24:06.520 --> 24:07.646
You're doing that, um...

24:08.440 --> 24:10.044
Crinkly thing, with your eyebrows.

24:10.360 --> 24:13.125
Just...
No, just something at work.

24:13.320 --> 24:16.130
It's no big deal. Um, this work, big deal.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.361
Liza Warner.

24:18.560 --> 24:21.166
I pulled her S.C.P.D. personnel file
using my computer at Palmer Tech

24:21.320 --> 24:22.367
since ours is fritzing.

24:22.560 --> 24:25.484
One of the original recruits
to the anti-vigilante task force

24:25.640 --> 24:28.564
- over three years ago.
- Hand-picked by then-Detective Lance.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.725
Do you think she's a suspect?

24:31.000 --> 24:34.402
I think that Sergeant Warner has deposited
over a quarter of a million dollars

24:34.560 --> 24:36.164
into offshore bank accounts
for the last three months.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.806
- Where can we find her?
- I am working on that.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.406
I used the network access
that Captain Lance gave us,

24:42.640 --> 24:44.927
and I turned on every
uniform and squad car camera

24:45.080 --> 24:46.730
on the force during the last 12 hours.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.849
I'm running facial recognition
looking for Warner.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.528
- Do you see something?
- No. Someone.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.041
Pause.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.201
<i>Zoom in.</i>

25:00.400 --> 25:02.243
The man that Lance is talking to...

25:04.360 --> 25:05.850
It's Damien Darhk.

25:18.440 --> 25:20.602
You know I got a heart condition, right?

25:21.920 --> 25:24.366
For years, you've looked at me
with such contempt...

25:26.280 --> 25:27.884
Utter disdain.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.565
So I'm wondering...

25:31.880 --> 25:34.531
Do I have that same look on my face now?

25:35.520 --> 25:38.091
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'm talking about you.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.244
And Damien Darhk.

25:45.760 --> 25:46.921
Okay, it's, it's...

25:47.120 --> 25:50.727
I didn't know if you knew who he was,

25:51.800 --> 25:53.564
or what he's been doing to this city.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.483
But now, I see this look on your face...

25:59.960 --> 26:00.961
You know.

26:04.440 --> 26:06.090
- It's complicated.
- No, it's not.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.288
Do you have any idea
how many people he's killed?

26:10.440 --> 26:11.726
Yeah, I've got more of an idea than you.

26:11.960 --> 26:14.930
And listen, you of all people,
you don't get to come into my house

26:15.080 --> 26:16.491
and pass judgment on me! All right?

26:16.640 --> 26:18.768
You always held yourself out
as better than me!

26:21.760 --> 26:23.091
More righteous.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.001
And you were.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.321
Until tonight.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.602
Actually, it's been
a little more than two months now.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.444
Me working with Darhk.

26:37.360 --> 26:38.850
It started out benign.

26:39.960 --> 26:44.284
He said he had resources,
he had people, money.

26:45.680 --> 26:49.127
He held himself out as just another guy
who wanted to help this city.

26:50.680 --> 26:52.205
And we needed the help.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.291
You weren't here.

26:57.840 --> 27:00.366
By the time I figured out who he was,
what he was...

27:02.200 --> 27:04.646
- That's when he threatened Laurel.
- Laurel can take care of herself.

27:04.800 --> 27:05.961
You see what she does out there.

27:06.120 --> 27:08.202
- That's what I thought about Sara, too...
- Stop it! Stop it!

27:08.480 --> 27:10.323
Stop hiding behind your daughters!

27:10.520 --> 27:13.171
They would be ashamed
of what you're doing right now.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.681
- You don't know what I'm going through...
- And you know the funny thing?

27:15.840 --> 27:18.047
You were the main reason
behind me running for mayor.

27:19.960 --> 27:24.807
A part of me has always wanted you to see
what kind of man I really am.

27:28.320 --> 27:32.325
I didn't expect to wind up finding out
what kind of man you really are.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.571
What're you gonna do?

27:44.400 --> 27:45.686
I don't know.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.605
So how'd you do it? Kill the woman.
How'd you do it?

27:54.920 --> 27:56.081
I strangled her.

27:57.240 --> 28:00.005
Thought you said you made it,
what was that word, memorable?

28:00.360 --> 28:01.771
She won't forget it.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.082
What? You gonna propose?

28:06.560 --> 28:08.927
You don't sound like a guy
who just committed his first murder.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.283
And I'm guessing
you didn't have too many opportunities

28:11.520 --> 28:13.602
at whatever posh boarding school
you grew up in.

28:14.440 --> 28:15.771
You think I'm lying?

28:16.440 --> 28:18.568
I think if you're not,
then you're a stone cold killer.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.807
Even if you didn't off her,
even if you're messing with me,

28:22.280 --> 28:23.805
which I do not recommend...

28:25.280 --> 28:26.645
I see it in your eyes.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.087
Reiter saw it, too.
It's probably why he recruited you.

28:30.600 --> 28:31.886
Saw what?

28:32.280 --> 28:34.089
You are one dark bastard.

28:35.200 --> 28:38.647
Something very cold inside of you.
And you're terrified of it.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.122
Okay, Conklin, tell me something.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.562
If I'm this dark person,

28:46.240 --> 28:48.083
shouldn't you be afraid of me?

28:49.320 --> 28:50.321
No.

28:50.640 --> 28:52.005
I'm the exact same way.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.449
If you're lying to me,
you're gonna find that out.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.686
- Nice sign.
- Yeah. Arrived this morning.

29:11.320 --> 29:12.810
Are you all right?

29:13.680 --> 29:14.841
Just thinking.

29:15.520 --> 29:16.681
About?

29:19.680 --> 29:21.603
Going to Sentinel games as kids.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.841
- Do you remember Papp Stadium?
- Oh, yeah.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.842
I loved the popcorn.

29:28.120 --> 29:30.168
Every time a Sentinels player
hit a homer,

29:31.160 --> 29:33.606
every single person in that stadium
stood and cheered.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.963
Every single one.

29:36.680 --> 29:37.681
United.

29:39.600 --> 29:44.288
And I wanted to run for mayor, because
I wanted to be the leader of that city.

29:45.120 --> 29:46.360
Wanted?

29:47.040 --> 29:49.281
Thea, I don't know
if that city exists anymore.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.322
I think that it might be beyond saving.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.885
So what are you saying?

29:57.640 --> 29:59.483
That I don't have to run for mayor.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.482
I'm sorry, baby, but you're not her.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.890
You're not her.

30:40.760 --> 30:41.841
Dad.

30:48.360 --> 30:51.091
- Dad, what the hell are you doing?
- I'm doing what I got to do.

30:53.080 --> 30:56.448
You got no idea the terrible things
I would do for both of you.

30:56.600 --> 30:59.604
No. No, you're not gonna kill
your own daughter...

30:59.920 --> 31:01.763
She's not my daughter!

31:02.120 --> 31:03.281
It's Sara.

31:07.800 --> 31:08.801
It's okay.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.645
Oh, God.

31:16.760 --> 31:17.807
What am I doing?

31:18.960 --> 31:21.884
- What am I doing? What am I doing?
- It's okay. Look at me. It's okay.

31:22.120 --> 31:23.929
You're okay. It's okay.

31:25.200 --> 31:28.249
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.765
Captain Lance?

31:34.160 --> 31:37.084
- Liza. What are you doing here?
- Heard you were looking for me.

31:37.440 --> 31:40.171
- Thought I'd make it easier for you.
- The hell are you talking about?

31:40.480 --> 31:42.289
What...

31:53.560 --> 31:54.686
Dad!

32:17.800 --> 32:19.370
Ever been here before?

32:19.760 --> 32:22.047
It's the S.C.P.D.'s contraband
disposal facility.

32:22.360 --> 32:25.887
Thousands of pounds of
Slam, Vertigo, heroin, all incinerated.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.008
- That's just literally burning money.
- Yep.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.680
And the site requires
a precinct Captain to gain access.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.122
- And that's not happening.
- What was your plan, Quentin?

32:33.800 --> 32:35.165
You have to know this city's dying.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.527
You were just gonna stay at your
desk until there was no city left?

32:37.720 --> 32:39.210
Tell you what I wasn't gonna do,
I wasn't gonna dishonor

32:39.440 --> 32:40.566
the badge, like you have.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.210
I'm no saint,
but at least I'm not a criminal.

32:42.520 --> 32:43.567
Neither am l.

32:43.880 --> 32:46.406
I'm just a desperate cop
who got backed into too tight a corner.

32:58.640 --> 32:59.880
What do we know?

33:00.080 --> 33:03.050
Liza Warner and her posse took Lance
outside of Laurel's apartment.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.402
- We need to find my father.
- I'm working on it.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.728
Just a little hampered.

33:08.240 --> 33:09.730
I think I got something
before the latest glitch.

33:10.080 --> 33:13.243
Captain Lance's ID was just used to access
the S.C.P.D. Contraband Disposal Facility,

33:13.400 --> 33:14.686
<i>three minutes ago.</i>

33:17.720 --> 33:19.210
<i>Thank you, Quentin.</i>

33:19.920 --> 33:22.924
Sorry about all the paperwork you'll have
to fill out when they find you here.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.764
Word of advice?
Put a bullet in my head now,

33:25.000 --> 33:26.445
'cause I am coming after you
with everything.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.842
By the time they find you,
we'll be long gone.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.242
We're leaving this city
like everybody else.

33:49.680 --> 33:52.081
New frequency. Same cry.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.120
Let's get out of here.

34:04.040 --> 34:06.964
<i>Sergeant Warner,
you have failed this city.</i>

34:09.120 --> 34:10.485
Is that all you got?

34:12.120 --> 34:13.326
<i>Nope.</i>

34:46.280 --> 34:47.610
<i>Get</i> out of here.

34:54.360 --> 34:57.364
All I got to do is push
and I'll sever your spinal cord.

34:58.320 --> 34:59.685
But you're not gonna do it, Liza.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.371
You said you're not a criminal.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.206
You kill that man, you are.

35:04.440 --> 35:08.206
I told you I wasn't a criminal.
But I also told you I was desperate.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.206
We all are.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.280
Living in this city,

35:14.040 --> 35:16.691
dealing with what we're dealing with
right now, we're all desperate.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.207
We've all been made to do
desperate things.

35:21.480 --> 35:22.811
Terrible things.

35:24.720 --> 35:28.520
But I've got to believe
that we are not beyond redemption.

35:29.560 --> 35:32.882
I got to believe that
this city can still be saved.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.885
'Cause once we stop believing,

35:36.720 --> 35:40.725
that's when this city really dies
and us, us right along with it.

35:41.680 --> 35:42.681
But, maybe...

35:43.320 --> 35:46.722
Just maybe, we start saving our home

35:48.240 --> 35:50.242
by saving ourselves first.

35:52.320 --> 35:55.927
And that means facing up to our mistakes.
That means facing justice.

35:59.400 --> 36:03.246
You put on that uniform
'cause you believe in justice.

36:03.560 --> 36:04.925
Ask yourself, Warner.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.410
Is that still the case?

36:14.760 --> 36:16.250
Do what you got to do.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.364
I guess you know your Miranda rights.

36:34.880 --> 36:37.770
- You got your own key or something?
- What you said to Warner saved my life.

36:40.680 --> 36:42.444
I didn't know you had such a way
with words.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.290
Well I don't do encores.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.804
You believe what you said?

36:47.640 --> 36:49.802
Yeah. Every word.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.767
Especially the part about facing justice.

36:54.480 --> 36:58.246
When One Police Plaza opens this morning,
I will be there, turning myself in.

36:59.480 --> 37:00.970
Can't have you do that.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.801
We haven't been able
to get close to Darhk.

37:04.800 --> 37:05.961
You have.

37:07.160 --> 37:08.810
I'd like you to stick around.

37:09.800 --> 37:11.131
Stay on the inside.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.001
Well...

37:15.240 --> 37:17.607
Well, that's only a smart plan
if you can trust me.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.007
I trust the man who said
we can't stop believing

37:20.280 --> 37:21.805
we can save this city.

37:50.680 --> 37:54.526
- Like I said, stone cold killer.
- You satisfied?

37:55.640 --> 37:57.051
Get rid of the body.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.682
This cave might be useful for something.

38:14.680 --> 38:16.887
It's okay. You're okay.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.486
How did you...

38:19.040 --> 38:20.724
Where did you learn to do that?

38:21.040 --> 38:22.565
I learned it here.

38:23.720 --> 38:25.563
I haven't always been alone
on this island.

38:50.560 --> 38:51.925
Son of a bitch.

38:57.240 --> 38:58.605
Oh, my God, he's here.

39:00.240 --> 39:01.241
<i>Hi.</i>

39:02.520 --> 39:03.521
How you doing, man?

39:04.200 --> 39:05.611
Oliver Queen. Oh!

39:05.760 --> 39:06.761
Hi, there.

39:07.280 --> 39:11.080
It's, uh, absolutely wonderful
that, that all of you are here.

39:11.440 --> 39:14.762
Just, just wonderful, and surprising.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.685
So? What do you think?

39:18.120 --> 39:21.966
Um, hey, did you, did you hire
all of these people?

39:22.280 --> 39:24.408
No. That's what makes them interns, Ollie.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.284
Where did we get all of these interns?

39:26.520 --> 39:29.285
Easiest way to get a lot of followers
on social media

39:29.440 --> 39:31.886
is to own a very successful club.

39:32.440 --> 39:35.649
All I had to do was tell them
what I've already known for three years.

39:36.800 --> 39:39.121
Oliver Queen is gonna save the city.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.809
- What's this?
- This is your speech.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.721
You're announcing your candidacy
this afternoon.

39:45.920 --> 39:48.605
So you better get your suit out
of mothballs.

39:50.320 --> 39:51.810
Did you write this?

39:52.800 --> 39:54.564
I wrote it down.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.170
I just went with what you told me.

39:57.880 --> 40:00.167
About this city being united.

40:02.800 --> 40:03.801
United.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.090
<i>That's what this city used to be.</i>

40:06.240 --> 40:10.165
<i>It's what it can be,
it's what it must be, again.</i>

40:11.600 --> 40:14.171
<i>Now I know that
I'm not the obvious choice for mayor.</i>

40:14.320 --> 40:16.163
<i>I'm not</i> a <i>politician.</i>

40:16.960 --> 40:18.689
<i>I signed away my family's company.</i>

40:19.080 --> 40:22.527
<i>I didn't even graduate from college,
although in my defense,</i>

40:23.680 --> 40:25.284
<i>I did go to four of them.</i>

40:25.840 --> 40:28.525
<i>I certainly don't have
a traditional background for leadership,</i>

40:28.680 --> 40:29.966
<i>but I can tell you this.</i>

40:30.160 --> 40:32.208
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

40:33.360 --> 40:35.283
<i>I returned home with only one goal.</i>

40:37.160 --> 40:38.605
<i>I wanted to save my city.</i>

40:39.120 --> 40:41.043
<i>And with your help, I can.</i>

40:42.200 --> 40:47.604
