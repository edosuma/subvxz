WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:14.294
When we completed interviews of the
refugees you brought back from Chulak,

00:14.199 --> 00:17.070
ten of them identified
the final four symbols

00:17.039 --> 00:20.289
the Goa'ulds used to escape
through the Chulak Stargate.

00:20.239 --> 00:24.367
When we disregard
the last one as point of origin,

00:24.280 --> 00:26.736
that leaves three to work with.

00:27.640 --> 00:31.175
Captain Carter's computer model
has thus far extrapolated

00:31.118 --> 00:34.405
only one set of symbols
from the Abydos cartouche

00:34.359 --> 00:36.683
that contains these three glyphs.

00:36.679 --> 00:39.170
Let me guess.
That's where we're going.

00:40.037 --> 00:42.411
- Very good, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

00:42.399 --> 00:45.850
I pride myself
on my deductive reasoning skills.

00:47.478 --> 00:51.691
In one hour, you will go through the gate
to the planet these symbols represent.

00:51.597 --> 00:54.598
It has been designated P3X-797.

00:54.637 --> 00:58.006
Couldn't we call it
something that's easier to remember?

00:57.957 --> 01:01.207
It's based on a binary code
used for extrapolation.

01:01.156 --> 01:04.775
<i>Which makes it
much easier to remember.</i>

01:04.718 --> 01:07.718
We sent an M-A-I-P probe
through 30 minutes ago.

01:07.677 --> 01:13.430
Atmosphere's breathable, no detectable
radiation. Temperature about 40Â°F.

01:13.278 --> 01:16.064
Can we see the video playback, sir?

01:16.037 --> 01:19.620
- There is no playback.
- Why no playback?

01:20.156 --> 01:24.367
It appears to be very dark
where the gate resides on this planet.

01:24.277 --> 01:27.313
The MALP probe has lights on it,
doesn't it?

01:27.635 --> 01:31.301
We think they were broken
during transport through the gate.

01:31.236 --> 01:34.902
This is crazy. We don't know
what could be there waiting for us.

01:34.837 --> 01:39.131
Don't you worry, boys. That's why
the SG-3 marines are coming with.

01:39.036 --> 01:42.037
You can count on us
to watch your backsides.

01:41.996 --> 01:45.530
Actually, it's more my front side
I was worried about.

01:52.034 --> 01:54.075
<i>Chevron four encoded.</i>

01:57.275 --> 01:59.231
<i>Chevron five encoded.</i>

01:59.234 --> 02:01.606
You're late. Put these on.

02:01.594 --> 02:04.168
Doesn't look like my prescription.

02:04.914 --> 02:06.989
Thermal night-vision goggles.

02:06.995 --> 02:11.206
Here's a question: why doesn't
the MALP have a set of these?

02:11.473 --> 02:13.762
<i>Chevron seven, locked.</i>

02:18.554 --> 02:23.299
<i>SG-1 and SG-3, you have a go.
Repeat, you have a go.</i>

02:23.353 --> 02:25.310
OK, we'll take point.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.771
Ah...

02:27.433 --> 02:31.514
We'll go through first. You watch
our lovely backsides, remember?

02:31.432 --> 02:34.006
Have it your way, flyboy.

02:35.394 --> 02:40.352
- Are you out of your mind?
- If Skaara or Sha're are on the other side,

02:40.233 --> 02:44.444
those jarheads will open fire as soon
as they see the light of their eyes.

02:44.353 --> 02:46.429
You want that?

02:48.033 --> 02:51.069
Give us a ten count, then come on down.

03:11.751 --> 03:13.826
One, one thousand...

03:14.551 --> 03:16.342
two, one thousand...

03:51.149 --> 03:53.224
Fan out.

04:22.668 --> 04:23.995
Haarrgh!

04:41.226 --> 04:42.769
Fire!

04:48.387 --> 04:51.423
I'm real glad it was you who took point.

04:53.947 --> 04:56.353
I'm OK. Thanks for askin'.

04:56.947 --> 04:58.855
- Everybody else?
- Think so.

04:58.865 --> 05:02.779
- What were those things?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

06:29.901 --> 06:31.976
Johnson.

06:50.100 --> 06:52.307
Daniel, what are they?

06:52.300 --> 06:56.000
Well, they don't look
completely Homo sapien.

06:55.939 --> 07:00.567
<i>The larger brow implies Homo erectus,
but then they'd have canine teeth.</i>

07:00.459 --> 07:04.410
<i>They could be Australopithecus,
but the brow would be less prominent.</i>

07:04.339 --> 07:06.831
- You don't know, do you?
- No.

07:06.819 --> 07:11.113
Why does that one female look different?
She looks more human.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.625
We have to stop him.

07:15.620 --> 07:19.783
No. That's how prehistoric males
probably always had sex - forcibly.

07:19.699 --> 07:22.451
The strongest male gets to mate -
survival of the fittest.

07:22.418 --> 07:24.875
Well, I call it rape, and we should stop it.

07:24.858 --> 07:26.733
Carter.

07:30.338 --> 07:33.542
- Where are those rocks coming from?
- There.

07:36.019 --> 07:41.060
Makepeace, you and your men take
a wide left flank. We'll take the right. Go.

07:41.819 --> 07:43.312
Let's go.

07:52.538 --> 07:54.613
Don't move!

07:55.538 --> 07:57.576
All right, hold your fire.

07:57.576 --> 08:01.160
<i>- They could be Goa'ulds.
- Just keep 'em covered.</i>

08:06.377 --> 08:08.867
There's no entry scar.

08:09.336 --> 08:12.752
They're not Goa'ulds.
Lower your weapons, kids.

08:16.336 --> 08:18.625
Any idea what they are?

08:18.615 --> 08:23.158
My lord, we are the Untouched.
I am High Councillor Tuplo.

08:23.055 --> 08:26.757
We are pleased the gods
have deemed us worthy of a return visit.

08:26.694 --> 08:28.237
Gods?

08:28.255 --> 08:31.672
Only the gods come through the Stargate.
I think they mean us.

08:31.615 --> 08:33.607
We should get used to this.

08:33.615 --> 08:36.023
Oh, for cryin' out loud.
We're not gods. Get up.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.138
Please. Come on.

08:40.336 --> 08:43.751
Perhaps they wish us
to treat them as mortals. A test?

08:44.174 --> 08:47.673
Please, let us take you
to the Land of Light.

09:36.971 --> 09:39.177
<i>Love what they've done here.</i>

09:39.173 --> 09:43.419
<i>I was gonna do my living room
like this, but it didn't go with my stuff.</i>

09:43.331 --> 09:45.657
<i>Looks Minoan.</i>

09:45.652 --> 09:48.653
Welcome. Please, come, sit.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.477
Is she all right?

10:09.490 --> 10:13.239
I do hope. She is my daughter.

10:13.770 --> 10:17.056
- What's her name?
- She is called Melosha.

10:17.010 --> 10:21.471
I can only hope we rescued her in time
from the hands of the Touched.

10:21.370 --> 10:25.320
We must now wait to see
if she has been cursed by them.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.536
The creatures that took her,
what were they exactly?

10:28.490 --> 10:32.985
The Touched. They were unfortunate
enough to be cursed by the Heelk'sha.

10:33.250 --> 10:37.081
Heelk'sha. There's a word like that
on Abydos. Is that "gods of the earth"?

10:37.009 --> 10:40.296
"Gods of the underworld." Evil gods.

10:40.250 --> 10:43.914
The Heelk'sha needed only
to touch the unfortunate among us

10:43.849 --> 10:48.309
and they would become possessed -
pure evil, like wild animals.

10:48.209 --> 10:53.036
So these... Touched people
used to live here with you?

10:53.009 --> 10:56.128
<i>They were us - until they changed.</i>

10:56.088 --> 11:00.501
They became too dangerous and we had
to banish them to the Land of the Dark.

11:01.448 --> 11:04.403
And where are these evil gods now?

11:04.488 --> 11:06.480
Oh, they do not show themselves.

11:06.488 --> 11:09.903
We know only of their presence
because of their actions.

11:09.847 --> 11:13.264
When was the last time
the good gods came around?

11:13.207 --> 11:19.957
Well, if you are not them,
then it has been at least a generation.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.123
A generation.

11:24.447 --> 11:28.860
OK. Um... Will you excuse us
for a moment? Just...

11:28.767 --> 11:30.972
No, please, don't.

11:30.966 --> 11:33.043
Whatever.

11:41.927 --> 11:45.674
Sounds like the Goa'ulds aren't here
and haven't been for some time.

11:45.605 --> 11:48.773
- That is my assessment as well.
- Daniel? Carter?

11:48.846 --> 11:52.298
In that case, gear up.
We'll move out in 15 minutes.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.571
- Wait a minute. Move out?
- Yeah.

11:54.566 --> 11:58.693
Back to the Stargate, back to Earth.
Terra firma? Home? You've heard of it?

11:58.605 --> 12:01.807
Uh, we should stay a while longer
and study this society,

12:01.764 --> 12:04.302
learn how they've evolved
the Minoan culture.

12:04.284 --> 12:07.451
I mean, you see those statues over there?
Those are bulls.

12:07.404 --> 12:10.774
The bull is all through Minoan culture
on Earth, but we never knew why.

12:10.725 --> 12:13.216
Hey, I'm a big fan of all this stuff,

12:13.205 --> 12:16.904
but art appreciation
is not what this mission is about.

12:16.924 --> 12:18.833
Get your gear together.

12:49.163 --> 12:51.202
- Find anything?
- Uh, no, sir.

12:51.202 --> 12:54.951
Yes, sir, actually, sir.
We found a whole hell of a lot, sir.

12:54.883 --> 12:59.509
Some beautiful dÃ©cor, nice folks...
Nothing of strategic importance, sir.

12:59.403 --> 13:03.352
All right. Get cleaned up.
Mission debrief in half an hour.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.999
I know I'm a guest at this party,
but I have to protest.

13:10.961 --> 13:14.875
Let me guess - this the science
versus military discussion again?

13:14.802 --> 13:17.588
Well, yes. This was
a perfect example of my argument.

13:17.561 --> 13:21.605
We should've stayed. It was the perfect
opportunity to study Minoan culture.

13:21.522 --> 13:23.230
Not to mention primitive man.

13:23.240 --> 13:27.653
- This really isn't necessary. I've already...
- Sir, would you let me finish?

13:27.562 --> 13:30.597
OK. The people on the dark side
are pre-Stone Age,

13:30.562 --> 13:34.855
those on the light side are Bronze Age -
where better to study the Broca Divide?

13:34.760 --> 13:36.918
The what? Excuse me.

13:36.921 --> 13:41.797
The Broca Divide. Pierre Paul Broca
was a 19th-century anthropologist.

13:41.681 --> 13:43.886
He founded modern craniometry,

13:43.880 --> 13:48.210
to compare the divide in intelligence
between early species of mankind.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.275
Fascinating.

13:50.798 --> 13:53.966
- Should I start the debriefing, sir?
- Good idea, Colonel.

13:53.919 --> 13:55.711
Now just wait a minute!

13:55.719 --> 13:58.720
You're wasting your breath.
You've already won the argument.

13:58.679 --> 14:01.883
But I have to insist...
What? I've already won?

14:01.840 --> 14:03.712
The president agrees with you.

14:03.720 --> 14:07.966
He's asked that we evaluate the scientific
and cultural value of each mission.

14:07.879 --> 14:10.500
- Oh, for cryin' out loud.
- He has?

14:10.638 --> 14:12.714
<i>That's great.</i>

14:14.278 --> 14:17.778
Wonder how that thing in your gut
would like his neck ripped in half!

14:17.719 --> 14:21.004
- Please release me, Lt. Johnson.
- Johnson! Let him go.

14:20.958 --> 14:23.711
Not until this Goa'uld apologises.

14:23.677 --> 14:25.671
Lt. Johnson, take your seat now!

14:25.677 --> 14:27.088
No!

14:34.636 --> 14:37.721
General, I would prefer
to not hurt this man.

14:44.878 --> 14:47.415
What is your problem, marine?!

14:47.876 --> 14:52.586
Take him to the infirmary. Tell them to
keep him in restraints and check him out.

15:01.235 --> 15:04.106
What do you think
that was all about with Johnson?

15:04.076 --> 15:06.317
Beats me. Maybe he was drunk.

15:06.755 --> 15:09.875
I don't know.
Didn't quite seem like inebriation.

15:11.556 --> 15:13.631
What the...?

15:37.514 --> 15:40.551
We need medics. Section C, stat.
Two men down.

15:55.354 --> 15:59.053
Carter. Uh, sorry,
I didn't know you were in here.

16:03.033 --> 16:05.110
Wait... What the hell is goin' on?

16:05.192 --> 16:07.730
- I want you.
- Why? I mean, no.

16:08.192 --> 16:11.609
Carter, this is a little out of line,
don't you think?

16:11.552 --> 16:13.461
Don't you want me?

16:13.472 --> 16:15.927
No! Not like this, for cryin' out...

16:17.631 --> 16:20.169
Carter, what's gotten into you?!

16:24.113 --> 16:27.232
<i>It's about time you saw a doctor, Doctor.</i>

16:34.312 --> 16:38.688
Keep her from hurting herself
until the sedatives take effect.

16:39.751 --> 16:44.248
- This pretty much what Johnson has?
- Oh, I'd say so. And the rest of the team.

16:44.152 --> 16:48.695
This is the strangest thing I've ever seen.
Come on, take a look.

16:53.551 --> 16:58.592
We converted DEFCON 1 bunkers from
the missile silo into isolation chambers.

16:58.471 --> 17:02.764
You never know what you're gonna
bring back through the Stargate.

17:07.108 --> 17:11.605
Notice the swelling of the brow ridge?
Some even have new follicle growth.

17:11.670 --> 17:14.077
- Any idea what's causing it?
- Wish I knew.

17:14.069 --> 17:17.902
I got calls in to all the specialists,
but I've got one hand tied behind my back

17:17.828 --> 17:20.747
because of the classification
of the Stargate project.

17:20.709 --> 17:24.327
And it's spreading.
We got two more in an hour later.

17:32.828 --> 17:37.372
I've never seen a behavioural disorder
like this. They're all acting like animals.

17:43.189 --> 17:46.521
- You think Carter has the same thing?
- Her behaviour fits.

17:46.469 --> 17:49.256
All the victims
are behaving like primitives.

17:49.228 --> 17:52.977
Most female low-level primates
choose the sexual partner

17:52.909 --> 17:55.400
who would give them
the strongest offspring.

17:55.388 --> 17:58.923
The leaders of a pack or a tribe
are usually the prime choice.

17:58.867 --> 18:01.739
- You should be flattered.
- Oh, yeah, I'm honoured.

18:04.586 --> 18:06.663
Jack.

18:07.387 --> 18:11.468
<i>I got on the Internet to research
Australopithecus and... Wow.</i>

18:11.386 --> 18:13.545
What happened to you?

18:14.707 --> 18:17.790
Oh, I got into a little
wrestling match with Carter.

18:17.747 --> 18:18.861
Why?

18:19.546 --> 18:24.088
I guess she's got whatever Johnson's got.
I had to drag her off to the infirmary.

18:23.987 --> 18:27.070
What, did she start a fight,
like Johnson did with Teal'c?

18:27.027 --> 18:31.106
No, she, uh... she tried to seduce me.

18:32.746 --> 18:34.822
Oh.

18:35.226 --> 18:37.182
You poor man.

18:37.185 --> 18:41.682
No, it wasn't like that.
She was like a wild animal. She was nuts.

18:41.586 --> 18:44.752
Well, is she all right? I should go see her.

18:44.865 --> 18:46.064
Why?

18:46.105 --> 18:48.644
What do you mean, why?
Because I care about her.

18:48.625 --> 18:53.086
- You care about her? What's that mean?
- It means she's my friend.

18:53.346 --> 18:56.097
- Now let... go.
- She's not yours to care about.

18:56.065 --> 19:00.229
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Samantha. Just stay away from her, OK?

19:00.144 --> 19:04.190
OK, Jack. I think you should
come with me to the infirmary, OK?

19:04.104 --> 19:06.773
Just let go of me and... Let go of my arm!

19:08.424 --> 19:11.046
<i>Security! Get in here!</i>

19:19.462 --> 19:21.538
Are you OK?

19:34.222 --> 19:37.425
We've isolated an organism
in the victims' bloodstreams.

19:37.384 --> 19:41.677
- Like a parasite or something?
- More like a parasitical virus.

19:41.583 --> 19:44.702
From what I can tell,
it feeds on amines and cholines,

19:44.663 --> 19:47.913
chemical transmitters in the body -
neurotransmitters too.

19:47.862 --> 19:51.859
As they're depleted, all but the most
primitive parts of the brain shut down.

19:51.781 --> 19:53.442
So they act like animals?

19:53.462 --> 19:55.869
The organism seems
to release a hormone

19:55.862 --> 19:58.614
that stimulates the primitive
regions of the brain.

19:58.582 --> 20:00.906
I have never seen
anything like this on earth.

20:00.902 --> 20:04.651
Exactly - on Earth.
That would explain the Touched.

20:05.942 --> 20:07.186
Beg your pardon?

20:07.221 --> 20:11.931
That's what the primitives were called
on P3X-797. The Touched.

20:12.259 --> 20:14.467
But I think, given recent events,

20:14.461 --> 20:18.210
it's safe to say they aren't born primitive -
it's a contagious disease.

20:18.141 --> 20:20.892
And we came in contact with them.
Isn't that special?

20:20.861 --> 20:24.941
So, the question is, why haven't you
and Mr. Teal'c got the symptoms?

20:24.861 --> 20:28.728
Uh, Mr. Teal'c. Tealc's symbiote
probably protects him.

20:28.661 --> 20:31.744
- That would be likely.
- What about you, Dr. Jackson?

20:31.701 --> 20:36.161
Beats me. You're the doctor, Doctor.
Maybe I have a natural immunity.

20:36.059 --> 20:39.345
- Or you will develop symptoms later.
- Thanks for the moral support.

20:39.299 --> 20:41.837
I'm checking both of your blood
for the organism,

20:41.818 --> 20:46.480
and I would bet that you both have it.
This appears to be highly contagious.

20:46.380 --> 20:50.247
Are you saying we could've
brought a new plague to this planet?

20:50.179 --> 20:52.670
Yes, sir, that's exactly what I'm saying.

20:52.659 --> 20:55.150
That's it. I'm ordering
this mountain sealed off.

20:55.138 --> 20:59.385
No one comes in or goes out
until we get a handle on this thing.

21:10.378 --> 21:13.829
<i>Containment team three
to sublevel 28.</i>

21:22.936 --> 21:26.721
- He's going to damage himself.
- The sedatives wear off fast.

21:26.657 --> 21:29.612
Help me give him some more.
Let's go! Go.

22:06.855 --> 22:09.346
Yes, sir, this is General Hammond.

22:09.934 --> 22:12.853
Sir, I'm afraid I have
a serious situation here.

22:12.815 --> 22:17.643
It appears we've brought a very
contagious disease through the Stargate.

22:18.214 --> 22:20.290
Yes, sir, that's right.

22:21.575 --> 22:25.903
Well, the mountain's sealed off, but I think
you should order in an army division

22:25.815 --> 22:28.269
as a second line of defence.

22:30.775 --> 22:34.108
I recommend that anyone
attempting to leave the mountain

22:34.055 --> 22:38.098
should be shot on sight...
and their body burned.

22:47.972 --> 22:51.342
- Good news, General.
- I could use some of that. What is it?

22:51.294 --> 22:53.785
They don't have the organism
in their system.

22:53.772 --> 22:56.773
Now, if we can isolate
why they've resisted it...

22:56.732 --> 23:01.061
- Ask the Untouched how they avoid it.
- Maybe they know something we don't.

23:00.972 --> 23:03.807
I could use a blood sample
from one of the uninfected.

23:03.772 --> 23:08.398
Maybe something in their systems
protects them - that we can synthesise.

23:14.093 --> 23:17.176
All right. Either of you
know how to draw blood?

23:17.132 --> 23:20.298
Doctor, teach them.
You go through in half an hour.

23:20.251 --> 23:22.624
Wait, wait... Just the two of us?

23:23.490 --> 23:26.777
You're immune.
I don't know anyone else who is.

23:35.171 --> 23:37.163
Do not worry, Daniel Jackson.

23:37.171 --> 23:42.165
The Touched are frightened by your loud
weapons. We can easily subdue them.

23:42.050 --> 23:44.541
That's easy for you to say.

24:05.250 --> 24:07.326
Teal'c.

24:21.409 --> 24:23.567
It's Melosha. She's alive.

24:24.088 --> 24:26.164
It appears she is afflicted.

24:27.248 --> 24:29.573
So they just dump her out here?

24:29.567 --> 24:32.023
We dump them in a small room.

24:32.008 --> 24:35.009
- To protect them.
- To protect everyone else.

24:34.969 --> 24:37.211
There is little difference.

24:37.568 --> 24:39.395
You know, you're right.

24:39.406 --> 24:43.107
They're like lepers.
And the dark side's a leper colony.

24:43.048 --> 24:45.337
What is a leper?

24:45.326 --> 24:48.742
Oh, God, never mind.
We have to help her.

24:52.248 --> 24:54.619
Are you planning on helping me?

24:54.607 --> 24:57.442
It is a long journey. We should leave her.

24:57.887 --> 25:00.175
No. Now let's... go.

25:12.446 --> 25:13.311
Teal'c!

25:13.366 --> 25:16.071
Fire your weapon. It will frighten them off.

25:26.925 --> 25:29.001
Daniel Jackson.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.842
Daniel.

25:38.404 --> 25:40.777
Daniel Jackson.

26:05.403 --> 26:10.612
Sorry, Colonel O'Neill, but your
private room just became semi-private.

26:10.482 --> 26:14.563
We're running out of places to put victims.
We've used the brigs, the temp quarters,

26:14.483 --> 26:16.808
some of the storage rooms...

26:18.482 --> 26:21.020
<i>Good luck, Doc...</i>

26:21.842 --> 26:24.167
Did you say something?

26:24.163 --> 26:26.036
Give more.

26:26.482 --> 26:28.723
What? Give more what?

26:30.123 --> 26:32.199
More...

26:35.002 --> 26:38.252
An injection?
You mean you want more sedative?

26:39.122 --> 26:43.701
You've already had twice as much as
anyone else because you're more violent.

26:43.603 --> 26:46.557
- Give.
- No. It's not safe.

26:47.001 --> 26:49.077
Give!

26:50.322 --> 26:51.981
Give.

26:52.001 --> 26:54.457
Why are you so insistent?

27:25.400 --> 27:27.855
You must've been in a lot of pain.

27:32.638 --> 27:34.512
Doc!

27:36.319 --> 27:38.395
Colonel O'Neill?

27:39.878 --> 27:41.671
It's...

27:44.159 --> 27:46.199
me.

27:48.558 --> 27:51.049
<i>So you are still in there somewhere?</i>

27:51.038 --> 27:54.490
A dr... dream.

27:54.958 --> 27:56.239
Dream.

27:57.519 --> 28:00.555
I'm afraid not, Colonel. It's very real.

28:02.237 --> 28:06.483
This is interesting. Enough sedative
must knock back the primitive mind.

28:06.397 --> 28:10.727
Colonel, I can't keep you at this level
very long. It is too dangerous.

28:10.636 --> 28:13.423
It could cause permanent brain damage.

28:13.396 --> 28:15.223
What...

28:17.596 --> 28:20.634
- What is it?
- It's a parasitic virus.

28:20.597 --> 28:24.262
All we can tell is that it seems to mess
with body chemicals - all of 'em.

28:24.196 --> 28:27.530
Testosterone levels skyrocket -
thus the aggressive behaviour.

28:27.477 --> 28:31.059
It's a histaminolytic, which means
it breaks down histamine. We...

28:30.997 --> 28:34.911
Experiment... on... me.

28:34.836 --> 28:37.375
Experiment on you?

28:37.355 --> 28:39.515
No, sir. I can't do that.

28:40.915 --> 28:42.909
Use me.

29:03.474 --> 29:06.392
Welcome back, my lord.
Where are your friends?

29:06.355 --> 29:08.512
My friends are ill because of this place.

29:08.515 --> 29:12.180
- They have joined the Touched.
- They were cursed by the Heelk'sha.

29:12.115 --> 29:15.068
It is not a curse. It is a disease.

29:16.394 --> 29:19.265
I lost my friend
on the dark side of this planet.

29:19.234 --> 29:21.108
You must help me retrieve him.

29:21.114 --> 29:24.945
Why? So he can give you the curse?
So he can give all of us the curse?

29:24.875 --> 29:27.080
No, no. He's better off where he is.

29:27.074 --> 29:32.448
He does not have the disease.
He is immune. He is not cursed.

29:32.314 --> 29:34.982
Then by now... he is gone.

29:36.313 --> 29:38.519
He had your daughter with him.

29:38.512 --> 29:40.969
Melosha... is dead.

29:41.712 --> 29:46.339
No. She is out there, on the dark side.
I have seen her.

29:46.792 --> 29:49.627
Help me retrieve her and my friend.

29:51.354 --> 29:55.980
She is among the Touched.
She can no longer function amongst us.

29:55.873 --> 29:57.949
Therefore she is dead.

29:58.512 --> 30:00.551
She is not dead.

30:00.553 --> 30:04.799
If I believed otherwise, do you not think
I would help my own daughter?

30:04.711 --> 30:07.797
Many of us have loved ones
among the Touched.

30:08.112 --> 30:10.603
My own father is there.

30:10.590 --> 30:15.170
But we accept that we cannot help them.
Therefore they are dead to us.

30:16.111 --> 30:18.482
How can you be so without heart?

30:20.191 --> 30:22.598
I must ask you to leave.

30:22.911 --> 30:27.786
If you will not help me find my friend,
then I must have a sample of your blood.

30:28.191 --> 30:31.275
- Our blood?!
- Blood is our life force.

30:31.631 --> 30:34.465
I assure you it will cause you no harm.

30:34.431 --> 30:39.093
I cannot abide this one
in my presence any longer.

30:42.510 --> 30:44.917
You are not welcome here.

30:45.309 --> 30:49.058
When we return,
I expect to find you gone.

31:19.148 --> 31:21.224
I am sorry.

31:51.467 --> 31:57.551
<i>All personnel, please be advised that the
mountain is under a code five lockdown.</i>

32:00.666 --> 32:03.833
- Thank God you're back.
- What happened to Captain Carter?

32:03.787 --> 32:08.912
She was stabbed by her roommate.
Don't worry, it's superficial. She'll be OK.

32:08.786 --> 32:12.451
We've run out of space. We had
to start doubling up on the iso rooms.

32:12.385 --> 32:14.923
I have the blood sample you requested.

32:14.904 --> 32:16.980
Good work, Mr. Teal'c.

32:18.145 --> 32:21.146
<i>Colonel O'Neill.</i>

32:25.144 --> 32:27.221
Teal'c.

32:31.065 --> 32:35.607
I am afraid I lost Daniel Jackson
on the dark side of the planet.

32:36.904 --> 32:38.980
I am sorry.

32:42.305 --> 32:45.471
Colonel O'Neill?
I think I might have something.

32:47.984 --> 32:50.736
I was examining the blood sample
Mr. Teal'c brought me.

32:50.703 --> 32:54.701
Then it hit me - there was
very little histamine in it.

32:55.544 --> 32:59.672
If the people on that planet are human,
they must have histamine in their blood.

32:59.584 --> 33:01.375
How does this help us?

33:01.383 --> 33:05.381
As I said, this microbe is a histaminolytic.
It feeds on histamine.

33:05.303 --> 33:08.969
The Untouched have no histamine,
so the organism can't survive in them.

33:08.903 --> 33:12.901
I do not understand. It is the Untouched
that become the Touched.

33:12.823 --> 33:17.615
If they have none of this substance,
why then do some of them change?

33:17.501 --> 33:20.039
Only some of them
have this low histamine level -

33:20.022 --> 33:24.151
which means there is probably
a natural antihistamine in their diets.

33:24.063 --> 33:27.146
The ones who don't eat it
eventually contract the organism.

33:27.102 --> 33:30.056
Which is what gave me an idea.
I checked the files.

33:30.021 --> 33:35.776
Both Dr. Jackson and I have acute rhinitis
caused by severe allergies.

33:35.622 --> 33:37.365
Explain.

33:37.383 --> 33:41.048
I take strong antihistamines every day.
So did Dr. Jackson.

33:40.981 --> 33:43.390
I have no histamine
for the microbe to feed on.

33:43.382 --> 33:47.213
Just like the Untouched,
the organism starves in my body.

33:47.141 --> 33:49.762
Does this mean you have a cure?

33:50.580 --> 33:55.326
We try megadoses of chlorpheniramine
maleate on someone and see if it works.

33:55.221 --> 33:56.680
Me.

33:57.180 --> 33:59.220
I thought you might say that.

33:59.220 --> 34:04.807
Now, the dose required to clear the body
of histamine could be harmful.

34:05.461 --> 34:07.537
You're sure?

34:23.300 --> 34:25.505
Now all we can do is wait.

34:25.500 --> 34:27.788
You'd better lock him up again.

34:54.617 --> 34:58.235
<i>Teal'c! Doc! Open the door!</i>

34:58.538 --> 35:00.614
Teal'c!

35:01.697 --> 35:04.733
- Colonel O'Neill?
- Lucy! I'm home!

35:05.538 --> 35:07.411
I am not Lucy.

35:07.416 --> 35:12.161
I know that. It was a reference
to an old TV... Never mind. Open the door.

35:12.056 --> 35:14.927
- I will summon the doctor.
- No, no. I'm fine.

35:14.896 --> 35:17.434
I'm back to being myself. Just open up.

35:17.456 --> 35:22.166
I cannot be certain you are back to being
yourself. You referred to me as Lucy.

35:22.215 --> 35:25.550
Oh, for cryin' out loud.
Will you just open the door?

35:30.976 --> 35:33.514
This stuff works. Let's find Doc.

35:40.414 --> 35:42.407
<i>Chevron three encoded.</i>

35:52.175 --> 35:54.132
Chevron four, encoded.

35:54.135 --> 35:57.717
The guns are loaded with darts
filled with chlorpheniramine.

35:57.655 --> 35:59.943
A direct hit on a Touched man or woman

35:59.934 --> 36:03.469
should knock them out long enough
in order to starve the disease.

36:03.414 --> 36:05.123
Good luck.

36:05.135 --> 36:07.043
Thanks, Doc.

36:07.815 --> 36:12.192
- We gonna try to trank all the Touched?
- Just the ones between us and Daniel.

36:12.094 --> 36:14.253
We'll leave the rest for the Untouched.

36:14.253 --> 36:18.297
<i>- You think he's still alive?
- Chevron seven, locked.</i>

36:21.853 --> 36:23.929
Let's find out.

36:36.733 --> 36:39.271
Guess the antihistamine wore off.

37:04.452 --> 37:09.362
Daniel, you dog. Keep this up,
you'll have a girl on every planet.

37:09.251 --> 37:11.659
Just let me give him an injection.

37:52.248 --> 37:53.623
What are you doing?

37:53.650 --> 37:56.485
You must not bring the Touched
among us. Leave, now.

37:56.449 --> 37:58.240
Just hear us out. Please?

37:58.248 --> 38:01.451
We found a cure.
And we can bring back Melosha.

38:01.407 --> 38:03.483
And your father.

38:05.248 --> 38:09.293
Put him in the isolation circle.
We will hear you.

38:17.447 --> 38:19.523
Let him pass.

38:45.887 --> 38:49.836
If you are not gods,
then how did you destroy the curse?

38:50.525 --> 38:54.476
As we've been saying, Tuplo,
it's not a curse, it's a disease.

38:54.405 --> 38:57.157
<i>- A sickness.
- Jack.</i>

38:58.085 --> 39:00.244
There's our boy.

39:04.126 --> 39:08.289
- Where are we?
- The light side of P3X-797.

39:09.606 --> 39:12.641
I thought we were gonna
give it a better name.

39:12.606 --> 39:14.681
He's back. He's normal.

39:14.684 --> 39:16.143
Explain.

39:16.164 --> 39:19.166
We know how to... lift the curse.

39:19.126 --> 39:21.795
How, if you are not gods?

39:22.085 --> 39:24.836
Come out there with us. We'll show you.

39:52.362 --> 39:54.438
Father!

40:17.601 --> 40:19.844
You have done it, my lord.

40:19.961 --> 40:21.871
Thank you.

40:22.360 --> 40:25.278
We'll teach you how
to take care of the rest.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.436
- Uh, sir?
- Yeah?

40:31.960 --> 40:35.710
About my earlier behaviour...
I wasn't myself...

40:35.641 --> 40:39.342
Oh, Carter, I don't even remember
your earlier behaviour.

40:39.280 --> 40:42.282
- You don't?
- No. I was infected too, remember?

40:42.239 --> 40:44.909
Right! Good, I'm glad.

40:46.121 --> 40:48.492
By the way, how's the wound?

40:48.480 --> 40:51.764
- Wound?
- I heard you got stabbed in the stomach.

40:51.719 --> 40:55.764
Oh... Yeah. It's nothing.
With any luck, there won't even be a scar.

40:55.679 --> 40:57.922
Oh, good. I was concerned.

40:57.920 --> 41:02.297
- You were?
- Sure. If it doesn't heal properly,

41:02.199 --> 41:06.411
you'll never wear that
sweet little tank-top number again.
