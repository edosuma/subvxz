<i>Narrator>></i> this is the closest i
can come to saying what I have
learned

00:30.163 --> 00:35.034
there's no shortage of
consequence in my life

00:41.174 --> 00:46.045
we need to leave some evidence,

00:47.213 --> 00:52.284
a little of us everywhere

00:59.826 --> 01:03.095
I spent all my time staring in
one direction

01:07.167 --> 01:09.234
and I missed it

01:13.406 --> 01:17.609
the most important moments

01:17.611 --> 01:23.715
were in the edges

01:23.717 --> 01:29.688
there were seven of them.

01:44.437 --> 01:47.506
<i> Karl>></i> over there

01:53.246 --> 01:57.116
turn around!

02:27.247 --> 02:30.149
<i> Sheriff mallon>></i> Conrad?

02:32.319 --> 02:35.587
You are going to have to drive

02:36.289 --> 02:40.159
<i> conrad>></i> you know, you are
really bleeding

02:40.293 --> 02:43.195
get in the car, come on!

02:46.299 --> 02:48.700
<i> Mallon>></i> hit a deer on the way
here

02:48.702 --> 02:51.803
- clipped her really

02:51.805 --> 02:55.307
she went flying headfirst into a
snowdrift,

02:55.309 --> 03:00.245
was not breathing so I took
the defibrillator over to her

03:00.247 --> 03:01.947
next thing I know she is wide
awake

03:01.949 --> 03:05.317
and she kicks me in the
face-Jesus!

03:05.319 --> 03:05.317
<i>Conrad>></i> you are bleeding pretty
badly

03:05.319 --> 03:10.322
you sure you do not want me to
take you to a hospital?

03:10.324 --> 03:14.793
<i> Mallon>></i> no, no. I have taken
some percodan. I can hardly feel
any of this.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.528
<i>Conrad>></i> there is a lot of blood

03:16.530 --> 03:19.331
<i>mallon>></i> you - you got your own
burden

03:19.333 --> 03:22.201
<i> mallon>></i> mother being found
after all these years

03:23.369 --> 03:26.471
hell-i hope we have enough
so you can ID her

03:26.473 --> 03:28.473
<i> conrad>></i> all I need are the
teeth

03:28.841 --> 03:30.909
mallon <i> >></i> yeah we should have
those

03:31.344 --> 03:35.347
cleared out the freezer
and put her parts in there

03:35.349 --> 03:39.618
everyone from the station
got to take some venison home

03:40.753 --> 03:43.555
<i>conrad>></i> guess you folks do not
get a lot of crime up here huh?

03:43.557 --> 03:46.358
<i> Mallon>></i> no sir. Especially
murder.

03:46.360 --> 03:50.295
Not til we found this body did
we think that he-

03:50.297 --> 03:53.265
literally killed her

03:55.368 --> 03:57.369
speaking of your father-

03:57.371 --> 03:59.838
your aunt thinks you may
have been talking with him?

04:00.373 --> 04:03.575
<i> Conrad>></i> I have not seen my
father since I left the farm

04:03.577 --> 04:07.579
<i>mallon>></i> seen is a tricky word.
No contact at all?

04:07.581 --> 04:07.579
<i> Conrad>></i> no

04:07.581 --> 04:12.584
<i> mallon>></i> if you have been
talking to him, and you do not
tell us about it

04:12.586 --> 04:15.654
that could be considered
accessory after the fact

04:31.404 --> 04:34.406
<i> mallon>></i> Abigail, this is
Conrad

04:34.408 --> 04:36.942
do not worry about it,
it is just a cut

04:36.944 --> 04:36.942
<i> abigal>></i> it is terrible.

04:36.944 --> 04:41.346
<i> Mallon>></i> you are making a
mountain out of a mole hill.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.415
<i> Conrad>></i> I told him to go

04:44.285 --> 04:54.793
<i> mallon>></i> Jesus, oh god. It is
ok, I am ok. Do not help me, i
do not want help

04:55.428 --> 04:58.430
<i> abigail>></i> we got to get him
patched up

04:58.432 --> 05:01.633
<i> abigail>></i> do you mind staying
here to hold down the fort?

05:01.635 --> 05:04.836
It is just the two of us and
the deputy has been on duty
since yesterday

05:04.838 --> 05:07.439
everybody and his dog
is sliding off the road

05:07.441 --> 05:09.074
<i> conrad>></i> you want me to stay
here alone-

05:09.076 --> 05:13.078
<i> abigail>></i> yes. I know it is
weird, but - ok, thanks!

05:13.080 --> 05:13.078
Okay, come on you

05:13.080 --> 05:16.448
<i> mallon>></i> no, no, no, no. No,
no! I got work to do!

05:16.450 --> 05:18.750
<i> Conrad>></i> you really need to go

05:18.752 --> 05:23.455
<i> abigail>></i> I win. Be strong,
come on. <i> Mallon>></i> okay

05:23.457 --> 05:25.457
<i>mallon>></i> sorry about this Conrad

05:25.459 --> 05:27.326
Abigail <i> >></i> alright, thanks

05:28.094 --> 05:30.362
<i> Conrad</i> >>mm hmm

06:49.543 --> 06:52.611
<i> Karl</i> >>do you know what
that word means?

06:53.479 --> 06:57.983
It is what you do to a woman
when there is no pleasure in it

08:08.254 --> 08:12.624
<i> abigail>></i> Conrad,
Conrad-

08:12.626 --> 08:15.627
<i> abigail>></i> Conrad, um -hi

08:15.629 --> 08:20.632
sorry abou that. Hungry?

08:20.634 --> 08:26.938
Sheriff was supposed to put you
up tonight, but he is in no
real position to entertain... so

08:26.940 --> 08:29.040
<i> conrad>></i> is there a motel?

08:29.042 --> 08:30.642
<i> Abigail>></i> in Chapman?

08:30.644 --> 08:32.711
No

08:33.044 --> 08:35.113
you are kind of stuck with me...

08:35.280 --> 08:39.551
I am on duty for the next few
ours, so...

08:42.655 --> 08:46.591
The deputy found a new bit of
evidence - murder weapon.

08:46.593 --> 08:49.661
Right about sixty feet from the
bones

08:49.663 --> 08:54.065
the handle was chewed up
like an animal dragged it
all about.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.668
<i> Conrad>></i> sawed off shotgun?

08:56.670 --> 09:00.672
<i> Abigail>></i> yeah

09:00.674 --> 09:07.679
<i> conrad>></i> I looked in the
freezer. It is not my mother.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.681
<i> Abigail>></i> are you sure?

09:09.683 --> 09:14.686
<i> Conrad>></i> yeah.
Her teeth were...A mess

09:14.688 --> 09:17.689
it is not her.

09:17.691 --> 09:21.693
<i> Abigail>></i> well-
i mean, who could it be then?

09:21.695 --> 09:24.696
We do not just have people
unaccounted for

09:24.698 --> 09:29.568
<i> conrad>></i> it is my father

09:30.703 --> 09:35.707
<i> abigail>></i> who would have
wanted to kill your father?

09:35.709 --> 09:38.610
<i> Conrad>></i> himself

09:43.716 --> 09:45.717
<i> abigail>></i> this happens a lot
this time of year.

09:45.719 --> 09:49.721
I cannot believe I only have
one blanket. Jeez! Brrr.

09:49.723 --> 09:54.726
<i>Conrad>></i> this day could not get
any weirder

09:54.728 --> 10:01.733
<i> abigail>></i> what was she like,
your monther?

10:01.735 --> 10:07.739
<i> Conrad>></i> she would never leave
me alone with my father for more
than two seconds

10:07.741 --> 10:12.744
<i> abigail>></i> do you think maybe
she is still alive?

10:12.746 --> 10:16.615
<i> Conrad>></i> no,i do not have any
hope of that

10:24.757 --> 10:27.759
you want to hear something

10:27.761 --> 10:30.629
<i> abigail>></i> okay

10:31.764 --> 10:34.666
<i>conrad>></i> about four weeks after
she disappeared,

10:34.668 --> 10:38.637
my father took me
on a walk out in the woods

10:53.786 --> 10:57.656
<i> karl>></i> over there

11:04.097 --> 11:08.166
turn around

11:35.829 --> 11:39.698
you wet yourself

11:47.840 --> 11:51.743
get up or you will freeze to
stump.

11:51.745 --> 11:55.747
Get on home.
You best hurry up.

12:02.855 --> 12:08.760
<i> Conrad>></i> when we got back he
started the fire on the stove,

12:08.762 --> 12:16.768
he told me to stand by it,
and he waited the whole time it
took for me to thaw out.

12:16.770 --> 12:23.742
In the morning he was gone.
I never saw him again.

12:25.878 --> 12:29.748
<i>Abigail>></i> it must be so terrible
for you to be back here. I'm so
sorry

12:30.082 --> 12:33.885
<i>conrad>></i> no I feel better about
it now.

12:33.887 --> 12:37.756
<i>Abigail>></i> because you know he is
dead?

12:39.525 --> 12:44.095
Conrad <i> >></i> it is knowing that he
intended to include himself.

12:44.097 --> 12:48.166
Makes it less personal

13:12.925 --> 13:19.130
<i> narrator >></i> it
all started when my family moved
from Illinois to new Mexico

13:19.132 --> 13:23.935
<i> mom>></i> stop it. How many times
have I told you that is bad for
your eyes?

13:23.937 --> 13:23.935
<i> Mom</i> >> stop it

13:23.937 --> 13:26.938
<i> charlie>></i> is dad going to pick
me up after school?

13:26.940 --> 13:27.939
<i>Mom>></i> no, you are going to walk
home.

13:27.941 --> 13:27.939
<i> Charlie>></i> mom!

13:27.941 --> 13:33.945
<i> Narrator >></i> the
doctor insisted we move to a
warmer climate

13:33.947 --> 13:36.815
for the sake of my father

13:37.950 --> 13:45.957
I remember not knowing what to
do, but knowing that I wanted to
be the least of their worries.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.167
And then I saw him.

13:56.169 --> 14:02.841
All I could remember on my first
day of school was the menacing
look he had on his face.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.943
His name was Bobby bell.

14:07.981 --> 14:12.851
<i> Boy #1>></i> one, two, three

14:22.995 --> 14:26.865
<i> bobby>></i> hey, you want to play?

14:29.001 --> 14:32.003
So, know how to play?

14:32.005 --> 14:32.003
<i> Charlie>></i> what is this game?

14:32.005 --> 14:36.007
<i> Boy #1>></i> you have to hit
it before it bounces twice

14:36.009 --> 14:38.009
but you cannot hit it before it
bounces

14:38.011 --> 14:40.011
and you cannot let it double
bounce or you are out

14:40.013 --> 14:40.011
<i> charlie>></i> okay!

14:40.013 --> 14:40.011
<i> Boy #1>></i> sound simple enough?

14:40.013 --> 14:45.884
<i> Charlie>></i> yeah I guess.

14:49.021 --> 14:51.022
<i> Bobby>></i> so, where you from?

14:51.024 --> 14:53.024
<i> Charlie>></i> uhm, Chicago

14:53.026 --> 14:56.027
<i> bobby>></i> Chicago. What is your
favorite food?

14:56.029 --> 14:59.030
<i> Charlie>></i> anything I guess
really

14:59.032 --> 15:00.031
<i> bobby>></i> tacos?

15:00.033 --> 15:01.666
<i> Charlie>></i> I guess

15:01.668 --> 15:07.672
<i> bobby>></i> yeah the rest of the
game though, you have to stand
right here

15:07.674 --> 15:11.943
against the wall, but you cannot
move.

15:15.047 --> 15:19.050
You cannot move. Stay still!

15:19.052 --> 15:21.052
Stay!

15:23.056 --> 15:23.054
Stay!

15:23.056 --> 15:27.058
<i> Charlie>></i> so just like this? I
thought, am I -

15:27.060 --> 15:32.063
yep, yes, just back up against
the wall and stay here

15:32.065 --> 15:34.465
okay

15:34.467 --> 15:36.067
<i> boy>></i> you're doing great

15:39.072 --> 15:41.940
<i> charlie>></i> good one

15:44.076 --> 15:46.945
<i> bobby>></i> do not move!

15:53.086 --> 15:54.986
Stay

16:31.123 --> 16:36.527
<i> dad>></i> hey, the new Mexico
outlaw is back. How was your
first day at school?

16:36.529 --> 16:39.130
<i> Mom>></i> make any new friends?

16:39.132 --> 16:42.133
It is okay if he did not. I
did not make any my first year
either

16:42.135 --> 16:46.137
I was just asking. Did you
honey?

16:46.139 --> 16:50.708
<i> Charlie>></i> yeah

17:06.558 --> 17:10.161
<i>charlie>></i> are you going to lose
all your hair?

17:10.163 --> 17:12.563
What?

17:12.565 --> 17:17.167
<i> Charlie>></i> in my book, it says,
when you have this disease, you
could lose all your hair

17:17.170 --> 17:22.040
<i> dad>></i> oh you are a doctor now.
Let us have a look.

17:28.380 --> 17:32.183
don not read books like this.

17:32.185 --> 17:36.087
<i> Narrator >></i> as
months went by, I remember
trying to do something -

17:36.089 --> 17:42.593
<i> narrator >></i> anything.
Whatever I could do to help my father win his fight.

17:42.595 --> 17:51.702
And suddenly, like a disease,
word spread around school.

18:30.243 --> 18:37.648
<i>Dad>></i> you know they say the cubs
could go all the way this year.
All the waaaay!

18:44.657 --> 18:53.264
<i>Dad>></i> I have been thinking about
this disease. It is like a bunch
of uninvited guests.

18:53.266 --> 19:02.140
You did not ask
them to come. They just showed
up one day and did not go home.

19:17.289 --> 19:21.292
<i> Bobby>></i> dad die yet Charlie?

19:25.198 --> 19:29.300
<i> Teacher>></i> I can't believe you
did that...

19:29.302 --> 19:33.171
<i> Teacher>></i> come on kids let us
go.

19:35.307 --> 19:39.177
<i> Dad>></i> Charlie

20:00.332 --> 20:05.203
<i> dad>></i> you want to explain
yourself?

20:23.355 --> 20:34.232
<i> Dad>></i> this fight that I am
having is mine. You understand?

21:20.412 --> 21:23.281
<i> Mom>></i> Charlie

23:02.515 --> 23:07.485
<i> narrator >></i>
his fight was also mine

23:07.487 --> 23:13.524
I am much older now, but a part
of me is still in that bed
beside him.

23:13.526 --> 23:17.728
The other part back
on that playground,

23:17.730 --> 23:25.803
hoping that fight
put me back together again.

23:46.559 --> 23:53.564
<i> Amanda>></i> pelicans can fly
three thousand miles without
stopping

23:53.566 --> 24:03.574
in the first world war-pelicans
transported supplies across
enemy lines

24:03.576 --> 24:10.581
<i> narrator >></i> Amanda
peeled labels, chewed nails, ate
the caps off pens

24:10.583 --> 24:14.585
twice she tried to kill herself

24:14.587 --> 24:19.790
I used to think we would be best
friends forever and not just
sisters

24:19.792 --> 24:23.594
that was before dad died

24:23.596 --> 24:27.731
before she went to rehab for the
third time

24:27.733 --> 24:33.804
before I moved far away from
the mess I used to call home

24:51.623 --> 24:54.825
<i>lisa>></i> hey you know uh, we were
invited over to Timmy later

24:54.827 --> 24:56.160
<i> amanda>></i> I do know

24:56.162 --> 24:59.630
what? I talk to him. He is my
ex-boyfriend

24:59.632 --> 25:02.633
<i> lisa>></i> yeah after he was mine

25:02.635 --> 25:06.604
<i>amanda>></i> I have no problem with
leftovers

25:06.606 --> 25:09.940
it does not even make any sense,
saying I drink like a fish

25:09.942 --> 25:13.644
it is like saying I read like a
word

25:13.646 --> 25:16.113
<i> lisa>></i> Amanda, who said you
drink like a fish?

25:16.115 --> 25:19.149
Mom just said you
should not drive

25:19.151 --> 25:19.149
<i>amanda>></i> mom said you
should not drive.

25:19.151 --> 25:24.655
<i>Amanda>></i> you know what, you are
more like the fish.
<i> Lisa>></i> I am ignoring that

25:24.657 --> 25:27.658
<i>amanda>></i> come on. You are being
a haddock. Like a smoked haddock
you know?

25:27.660 --> 25:30.661
<i> Lisa>></i> ok I have been home
for like an hour-

25:30.663 --> 25:34.665
can we just have a
normal conversation please?

25:34.667 --> 25:34.665
<i> Amanda>></i> sorry

25:36.802 --> 25:38.068
<i> lisa>></i> oh!

25:39.672 --> 25:43.674
<i> Amanda>></i> does anybody want
a muddy Mary?

25:43.676 --> 25:46.076
With some leaves on top?

25:46.078 --> 25:47.678
Crap.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.680
Oh! You know what she
should do?

25:49.682 --> 25:51.882
We should go inside
and get a cognac

25:51.884 --> 25:53.984
that is the perfect dusk drink!

25:53.986 --> 25:57.321
<i> Lisa>></i> do you think you
should just slow down a
little bit?

25:57.323 --> 25:57.321
<i> Amanda>></i> why?

25:57.323 --> 26:02.693
I am celebrating my sisters
annual abbreviated trip to
the homeland

26:02.695 --> 26:06.697
<i>lisa>></i> okay - well the sun does
not go down for another three
hours

26:06.699 --> 26:12.703
<i> amanda>></i> yeah, but if you
get started early, anything is
possible

26:12.705 --> 26:17.575
you of all people should know
that Lisa.

26:19.711 --> 26:24.114
<i>Amanda performing>></i> the combined
IQ of a colony of ants

26:24.116 --> 26:31.622
exceeds the intellect of most
us senators

there are no streetlights in
this town that work?

29:18.890 --> 29:22.893
You still work at that delivery
place?

29:22.895 --> 29:29.900
<i>Amanda>></i> yes - yes. That is what

quit that three years ago

29:29.902 --> 29:35.906

<i>Lisa>></i> okay - uhm - let us not

29:46.919 --> 29:50.921
<i>amanda>></i> okay - I work at a dock

<i> Amanda>></i> do you listen to
any decent bands?

30:02.934 --> 30:07.471
<i> Amanda>></i> I wanted to do some
more artistic stuff so i
decided to become a monologuist

<i> lisa>></i> is that like a comic?

30:09.441 --> 30:12.943
<i>Amanda>> </i> no, it is like
uhm, performance art, you know?

30:12.945 --> 30:16.947
<i>Amanda>></i> so I would tell stories
about my life

30:16.949 --> 30:20.951
and I would incorporate facts
about animals and sort of do
this -

30:20.953 --> 30:23.954
<i> lisa>></i> awe inspiring

30:23.956 --> 30:30.360
<i>amanda>></i> yeah - I kept trying to
push the show and push, push,
push!

30:30.362 --> 30:35.966
<i> Amanda>></i> I was just hoping
eventually somebody would get
what I was going for

30:35.968 --> 30:37.968
<i> amanda>></i> do you know what i
mean?

30:37.970 --> 30:37.968
<i> Lisa>></i> yeah

30:37.970 --> 30:40.370
<i> amanda>></i> yeah

30:40.372 --> 30:45.976
<i>lisa>></i> I mean - I have a kind of
idea of the man I want but -

30:45.978 --> 30:50.848
the fucking clowns i
meet are never anywhere close

31:02.994 --> 31:06.997
<i> Amanda >> the</i>
<i> stingerless bee becomes</i>
<i> an outcast</i>

31:06.999 --> 31:11.001
<i> and must make its way in</i>
<i> a world alone</i>

31:13.005 --> 31:16.006
<i>lisa>></i> thinness is genetic. Like
baldness

31:16.008 --> 31:23.013
<i> amanda>></i> unless you are me
and then you are really skinny
but that is because you never
eat

31:23.015 --> 31:28.018
right? Look at
that. Look at it. You wanna
put your little nose in there?

31:28.020 --> 31:33.223
You wanna put your little
nose in there? There - put your
little nose in it.

31:33.225 --> 31:37.294
I like your hair.
Do not listen to my sister.

31:45.237 --> 31:50.307
<i> Lisa>></i> do you have any
drinking beverages in here?

31:53.044 --> 31:57.915
<i>Amanda >> a pelican</i>
<i> can fly three thousand miles</i>
<i> without stopping.</i>

32:02.053 --> 32:11.061
<i> In the first world war -</i>
<i>pelicans were used to transport</i>
<i> supplies against enemy lines. </i>

32:14.066 --> 32:24.341
<i> The combined IQ of a colony</i>
<i> of ants exceeds that of the</i>
<i>intelligence of most us senators</i>

32:26.945 --> 32:34.084
<i>my sister and I went to see the</i>
<i>famous monkeys at the St. Louis</i>
<i> zoo. </i>

32:34.086 --> 32:37.087
<i> Lisa>></i> what famous monkeys?

32:37.089 --> 32:42.092
<i> Amanda>> the monkeys shared a</i>
<i> tail.</i>

32:42.094 --> 32:47.731
<i> Amanda >></i> you could not tell
where the first monkey ended

32:47.733 --> 32:52.102
and the next monkey began

32:52.104 --> 32:54.104
<i>Lisa >></i> I forgot how
many signs we had.

32:54.106 --> 32:58.508
The hand signal that indicated
someone was lying.

32:58.510 --> 33:02.112
The nostril flare that meant we
were dealing with a loser.

33:02.114 --> 33:14.124
The hiccup that said, let us
get the hell out of here.

33:14.126 --> 33:19.329
<i> Amanda>></i> they would never let
anything separate them

33:19.331 --> 33:24.134
not even the third monkey

33:24.136 --> 33:30.007
who went into the kitchen to get
the first monkey a drink

33:59.170 --> 34:02.039
<i> amanda>></i> and then one day

34:04.175 --> 34:07.044
their father crashed into
a tree

34:09.179 --> 34:18.054
and monkey one and monkey two
dived into the magic bottle.

34:19.322 --> 34:23.393
And monkey one
transformed into a bird.

34:24.195 --> 34:28.065
And monkey two transformed into
a fish.

34:29.199 --> 34:33.070
And when they spoke to each
other

34:33.670 --> 34:39.743
neither of them could understand
what each other was saying
anymore

34:41.212 --> 34:44.081
<i> Amanda >></i> what do
you think?

34:45.216 --> 34:49.085
<i> Lisa >></i> you are
prettier than I am

<i> Monica>></i> hi, I am Monica.

36:23.215 --> 36:28.218
<i> Mr. chub>></i> I am mr chub. May i
see your drivers license?

36:28.220 --> 36:33.190
<i>Monica >></i> why you get
a lot of strange women
pretending to me maids?

36:34.325 --> 36:38.228
<i> Monica >></i> usually i
do not mind being carded, but
not at work.

36:38.230 --> 36:41.231

36:41.233 --> 36:44.201
<i> Mr. chub>></i> oh - I have my

37:00.351 --> 37:03.653
<i> Mr. chub>></i> so, uh, Monica -
did you bath this morning?

37:03.655 --> 37:08.725

You will not be sorry.

37:14.266 --> 37:19.269
<i> Monica>></i> no! You are my
employer. We should keep it that
way.

37:19.271 --> 37:23.373
Besides I don't think my
boyfriend would like it very
much

37:29.681 --> 37:33.383
<i> monica>></i> what? You do not have
the right to ask me that.

37:33.385 --> 37:37.687
<i> Mr. chub>></i> I did not mean to
offend. I just have a thing
about cleanliness.

37:37.689 --> 37:37.687

His hair is kind of nappy though
- I mean natty - natty is not a
racist word, is it?

37:43.795 --> 37:46.029
I dated a black guy once

37:46.031 --> 37:49.299
come this way. Thank you.

37:53.404 --> 37:56.273
<i> Monica>></i> wow.

about knocking?

38:27.339 --> 38:29.439

startle you.

<i> know about. </i>

39:00.472 --> 39:04.474

39:04.476 --> 39:07.877

The mysterious woman from El
Paso

days of a life.

three mean step sisters.

47:13.965 --> 47:19.535
And she had to clean the house
every single day. Top to bottom.

47:19.537 --> 47:25.975
And then one day there was
an announcement on TV that said
there would be a big ball.

47:25.977 --> 47:25.975
And she really wanted to go

47:25.977 --> 47:35.985
beause she knew that the man she
was supposed to be with was
going to be there.

47:35.987 --> 47:40.857
And she knew if she went there
she would...

47:40.859 --> 47:48.030
Live happily ever
after and be a very famous
writer.

48:26.036 --> 48:33.042
<i> >></i> Hi Paul, it is Laura.
I heard you were going to be in town

48:33.044 --> 48:37.046
so I thought maybe if you had
time you could stop by

48:37.048 --> 48:42.051
I would really like you to
meet my son Chris. We are at my
moms house

48:42.053 --> 48:42.051
<i> >> 'next message'</i>

48:42.053 --> 48:48.691
<i> caddy>></i> hi Paul. They just
released your father and we
should be home soon

48:48.693 --> 48:53.562
I do not want you to be
surprised when you see him,
okay? He has gotten worse.

48:53.564 --> 49:00.069
The stroke left him agitated.
Maybe you can take him for a
drive tomorrow

49:00.071 --> 49:02.071
he always liked that.

49:02.073 --> 49:05.074
<i> Caddy>></i> so good to see you.

49:05.076 --> 49:10.313
<i> Edmund>></i> l... let... let go.

49:10.315 --> 49:15.084
<i>Caddy>></i> maybe you should get rid
of that thing. Do you not need a
truck for your business?

49:15.086 --> 49:18.487
<i> Edmund>></i> lazy, does not like
anything old.

49:18.489 --> 49:23.092
<i>Paul>></i> stop that. Call her caddy
please.

49:23.094 --> 49:28.965
<i> Caddy>></i> Paul would you help me
in the kitchen please.

49:46.116 --> 49:50.119
<i> Caddy>></i> Laura brought us home
from the hospital.

49:50.121 --> 49:54.457
<i> Paul>></i> did she?

49:54.459 --> 49:58.127
<i> Caddy>></i> she had the boy with
her.

49:58.129 --> 50:03.132
<i>Edmund>></i> that boy looks exactly
like you.

50:03.134 --> 50:05.001
<i> Paul>></i> boys not mine.

50:05.003 --> 50:09.071
<i> Caddy>></i> we know that.

50:10.140 --> 50:15.011
<i> Edmund>></i> that kid is the
spitting - mmm - mmm

50:17.147 --> 50:21.017
<i> paul>></i> spitting image.
Spitting image.

50:24.154 --> 50:27.023
<i> Caddy>></i> not in the house.

50:29.159 --> 50:31.160
There are blankets and sheets on
the couch.

50:31.162 --> 50:37.033
And shower - I could smell
the wood lacquer on your skin.

50:43.508 --> 50:46.575
<i> Paul>></i> stop that. Just stop.

51:51.241 --> 51:55.244
<i>Edmund>></i> just like me. Not long
for the world.

51:55.246 --> 52:01.250
<i> Paul>></i> no just needs a little
love that is all. Just a little
bit of love.

52:01.252 --> 52:03.252
Watch this

52:08.259 --> 52:14.263
see dad, told you, she is not
ready to leave me yet.

52:14.265 --> 52:17.266
<i> Paul>></i> what does mom make of
all that smoking stuff?

52:17.268 --> 52:18.767
<i> Edmund>></i> I do not know.

52:18.769 --> 52:21.137
<i>Paul>></i> I read somewhere a couple
weeks ago

52:21.139 --> 52:24.273
that doctors are saying they're
actually good for you

52:24.275 --> 52:26.675
especially if you had stroke
there suppose to really good

52:26.677 --> 52:31.280
<i> edmund>></i> oh that is perfect. I
am going to remember that.

52:31.282 --> 52:34.150
<i> Paul>></i> good.
<i> Edmund>></i> yeah.

52:36.286 --> 52:39.288
<i> Edmund>></i> how is work?

52:39.290 --> 52:43.292
<i> Paul>></i> I quit the.. I quit the
paper.

52:43.294 --> 52:47.296
<i> Edmund>></i> why? You are a good
writer.

52:47.298 --> 52:51.300
<i> Paul>></i> yeah I make furniture
full time now

52:51.302 --> 52:56.172
<i> edmund>></i> well - you always
liked wood.

52:56.174 --> 52:59.842
<i> Paul>></i> mom did not tell you
that?

52:59.844 --> 53:09.919
<i> Edmund>></i> she does not tell me
a goddamn thing. But she - she
- she told me that.

53:17.327 --> 53:20.963
<i> Edmund>></i> oh, I knew you would
make that turn.

53:20.965 --> 53:25.901
<i> Paul>></i> what do you mean? No,
you said go anywhere. I do not
care we can go anywhere.

53:25.903 --> 53:29.338
<i> Edmund>></i> you cannot keep away
from her.

53:29.340 --> 53:33.642
<i> Paul>></i> what are you talking
about?

53:33.644 --> 53:39.348
<i> Paul>></i> oh look, hey, no, no, i
did not even notice this was her
street.

53:39.350 --> 53:43.352
<i> Edmund>></i> oh well, you do not
notice most things.

53:43.354 --> 53:48.224
<i>Paul>></i> oh, I do not notice most
things? Is that not
interesting...

53:59.369 --> 54:05.374
<i>Edmund>></i> you see, he looks just
like, just like you when you
were young.

54:05.376 --> 54:07.876
<i> Paul>></i> yeah... well that kid
is not my kid.

54:07.878 --> 54:07.876
<i> Edmund>></i> look at him!

54:07.878 --> 54:07.876
<i> Paul>></i> what do I gotta look at
him for? Hey, hey, hey, listen -

54:07.878 --> 54:15.851
that is not my son. That is not
my son, I do not know why you
do not get that.

54:15.853 --> 54:27.930
Why am I gonna look at
him. Thats not my son. What a
dumb thing to say.

54:40.477 --> 54:42.544
<i> Caddy>></i> did he smoke?

54:42.546 --> 54:46.415
<i> Paul>></i> yeah, I did not see a
point in keeping him from it.

54:46.417 --> 54:55.924
<i> Paul>></i> we drove past the, by
Laura's house. How is she doing
these days?

54:55.926 --> 55:01.997
<i>Caddy>></i> she thinks of herself as
family. Coming to the hospital
and everything.

55:09.439 --> 55:13.942
<i> Paul>></i> you know, I do not know
how you put up with that every
day.

55:13.944 --> 55:17.746
He is so rude. He does not
know he is being rude. He drives
around saying shit...

55:17.748 --> 55:26.522
<i> Caddy>></i> your father has always
been a little mean. It is all
he has got left.

55:26.524 --> 55:30.793
I cannnot deny him
the one thing that he can still
feel.

55:30.795 --> 55:33.462
<i> Paul>></i> I do not remember any
meanness in him.

55:33.464 --> 55:40.336
<i>Caddy>></i> glad you feel that way.
I do not have a particular hole
in my memory.

55:43.473 --> 55:47.976
Everyone has a little
meanness in them.

55:47.978 --> 55:50.479
You should see the child.

55:50.481 --> 55:58.354
<i> Caddy>></i> I know. He is not your
son. But she was your wife.

55:58.356 --> 56:00.489
<i> Paul>></i> she was my wife.

56:00.491 --> 56:04.026
She led me to believe we would
get back together for four
months

56:04.028 --> 56:08.497
and just never bothered to
say, umm, oh I am pregnant.

56:08.499 --> 56:13.135
<i>Caddy>></i> sometimes, honey, people
cannot speak their thoughts.

56:13.137 --> 56:16.672
Other words come out instead.

56:16.674 --> 56:20.743
Go see them.

57:11.561 --> 57:15.431
<i> Laura>></i> you come to see me, or
him?

57:17.567 --> 57:20.569
<i> Paul>></i> you look like yourself.

57:20.571 --> 57:24.440
<i> Laura>></i> I suppose that is a
compliment.

57:28.578 --> 57:31.580
<i> Paul>></i> so what are you up
to these days?

57:31.582 --> 57:40.589
<i> Laura>></i> umm, I am a teller at
the bank, but mostly I take care
of cliff. And, uh, you?

57:40.591 --> 57:47.596
<i> Paul>></i> I make furniture now.
Business is improving.

57:47.598 --> 57:54.603
Eventually there might be some
money in it. But I am happier
around the lumber.

57:54.605 --> 57:57.906
<i> Laura>></i> I remember you always
used to say, wood cannot be
forced.

57:57.908 --> 58:02.978
You have to discover
the form within.

58:03.179 --> 58:05.180
<i> Paul>></i> I do not think I said
that bullshit,

58:05.182 --> 58:08.016
but if I did it was probably
just to impress you.

58:08.018 --> 58:11.086
<i> Laura>></i> you did.

58:15.625 --> 58:19.628
<i> Paul>></i> hey buddy. How old
are you?

58:19.630 --> 58:22.498
You are a big boy.

58:26.636 --> 58:29.505
You like
horses? Huh?

58:37.648 --> 58:41.650
You can have him, if you want
him.

58:41.652 --> 58:45.821
<i> Laura>></i> hey honey, you want to
run inside and show grandma your
new toy?

58:45.823 --> 58:49.892
Mommy is going to talk
to her friend.

58:54.664 --> 58:57.533
<i> Laura>></i> that was kind of you.

59:07.677 --> 59:12.681
<i> Laura>></i> you are still driving
the swinger?

59:12.683 --> 59:22.658
<i> Paul>></i> my dad loves her. I let
him smoke in it. He, uh, is not
himself anymore. You know.

59:22.660 --> 59:28.730
Sometimes he looks like my
father. Occasionally sounds
like my father, but he is...

59:42.712 --> 59:46.582
<i> Laura>></i> I thought it would be
to strange to send you pictures.

59:49.719 --> 59:55.591
I had a fling.
He looked like you.

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:13.742
<i> Paul>></i> I guess I should go.

01:00:13.744 --> 01:00:17.646
<i> Laura>></i> you know where to
find us.

01:00:17.648 --> 01:00:21.617
<i> Paul>></i> yeah.

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:45.173
<i>Paul>></i> my girl. My girl. That is
what I wanted to say. You look
yourself,

01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:48.176
I wanted to say you look like my
fucking girl, man.

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:58.253
Stupid ass idiot. Then what?
Then what!? Then what? I do not
know.

01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:10.265
<i> Paul>></i> what should I do?

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:57.145
<i> Older Michael narrating>></i> we
were locked out.

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:59.848
<i> Older Michael narrating>></i> we
would have to make a decision
soon.

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:03.719
Break in or hike a
few miles back to town.

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:09.091
But for now, we were
teenaged boys with one concern.

01:02:09.093 --> 01:02:11.893
<i>Lee></i> a couple summers ago I was
at church camp.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:15.731
And you now how they have each
day you got a different
activity.

01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:21.002
Well, this particular day it was
art and crafts, and I mean i
was not into it.

01:02:21.004 --> 01:02:24.106
<i> Lee>></i> you know I hate crafts.
<i> Michael>></i> you hate arts
and crafts.

01:02:24.108 --> 01:02:27.943
<i> Lee>></i> yeah. So this girl, i
kind of see her looking at me.

01:02:27.945 --> 01:02:31.913
And she was beautiful. I mean,
she had like this perfectly
feathered hair

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:31.913
and she had the most incredible
singing voice.

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:38.787
She could have had a record
deal, that is what I told her.
And so I was talking to her.

01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:42.257
And we were supposed to be
making those gods eyes with the
yarn or whatever.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:46.828
And I was like 'hey you want to
get out of here?' And shes like
'okay'

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:50.932
so, I said come with me.
And we start making out. You
know,

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:56.037
it is like I am telling you. It
is those innocent girls that get
the craziest.

01:02:56.039 --> 01:02:57.839
<i> Michael>></i> they are crazy,
naughty.

01:02:57.841 --> 01:02:59.908
<i> Lee>></i> it is like all
repressed inside or something.

01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.908
<i> Lee>></i> and her ass. Oh my god.

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:06.414
Her ass was so round, it was
like the most perfectly round
thing that you have ever seen.

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:06.414
<i> Michael>></i> like a bubble?

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:06.414
<i> Lee>></i> I did not even know
nature could create something
-it was like a babies head.

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:13.321
<i> Greg>></i> god dammit, Michael.
<i> Michael>></i> oh yeah, real soft.
Like a babies cheeks.

01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:13.321
<i> Lee></i> yeah, yeah, just like two
little babies heads.

01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:17.492
<i> Older Michael narrating>></i> it
goes without saying that this
was bullshit.

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:20.929
Lee was starving for information
about sex just like the rest of
us.

01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:26.935
A few years back, lees father
was caught performing an
abortion and stripped of his
license to operate.

01:03:26.937 --> 01:03:29.938
Lee did not touch or comfort his
father.

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:33.942
He did not ask about the
law or justice or even who
the woman was.

01:03:33.944 --> 01:03:35.944
He only asked one thing

01:03:35.946 --> 01:03:41.950
<i> lee>></i> was she naked?

01:03:41.952 --> 01:03:49.958
<i> Lee>></i> she was such - such good
pussy, man. What about you Greg?

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.962
<i>Greg>></i> well, it was not quite as
innocent as Bible camp...

01:03:53.964 --> 01:03:55.964
<i> Michael>></i> get ready for the
bullshit.

01:03:55.966 --> 01:03:58.200
<i>Greg>></i> hey! So, I am out mowing
my lawn.

01:03:58.202 --> 01:04:02.871
Its my neighbors yard and she
was probably like maybe forty
something,

01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:07.275
I am not sure, but she was not
too old, but like just right!

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:10.612
And she comes out like half way
through, alright -

01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:14.349
<i>lee>></i> and she invites me in for
cookies and lemonade.
<i> Michael>></i> your neighbor??

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:14.349
<i> Greg>></i> it is like..
<i> Lee>></i> twinkies and lemonade?

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:19.487
<i> Greg>></i> she must have known
me, I do not know how, but
she got me.

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:23.992
And next thing I know she comes
back around twinkies, lemonade,
no shirt, no bra.

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:27.896
Just tits man, they were like -
if I had to compare them -

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:33.001
I would probably say like
working with - maybe a mango -
you know what I am saying.

01:04:33.003 --> 01:04:33.001
Like a mango

01:04:33.003 --> 01:04:39.007
almost like, you know how like
when your checking the mango to
make sure it is not rotten.

01:04:39.009 --> 01:04:41.176
But it is squishy and stuff.
<i> Lee>></i> yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:41.178 --> 01:04:44.246
<i> Greg>></i> it is like a rotten
mango. So anyway you know - i
start

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:47.215
of course the twinkies
and lemonade are long gone.
Fuck that.

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:51.019
And so I am fucking her and she
starts making this noise.

01:04:51.021 --> 01:04:54.923
And dammit if I had a tape
recorder for that noise. It
was beautiful.

01:04:54.925 --> 01:04:59.027
<i> Michael>></i> what was it?
<i> Greg>></i> it was - it was a
damn serenade of beauty.

01:04:59.029 --> 01:05:02.097
<i>Lee>></i> I want to hear the noise.
<i> Greg>></i> I wish I could
create it. It was..

01:05:02.099 --> 01:05:04.332
<i> Michael>></i> yeah you can, go
ahead. Come on. Make the noise.

01:05:04.334 --> 01:05:06.034
<i> Greg>></i> no I cannot. I cannot.
I cannot.

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:08.103
<i> Lee>></i> was it a little like -

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:14.042
<i> michael>></i> yeah, like fucking a
retarded pig kind of.

01:05:14.044 --> 01:05:19.414
<i> Greg>></i> no, no, no, no. It was
like, you know what. Alright,
for you all sakes.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:23.051
Okay. I will make the
noise, alright. One time show.

01:05:23.053 --> 01:05:23.051
<i> Michael & lee>></i> thank you,
alright!

01:05:23.053 --> 01:05:29.691
<i> Greg>></i> please take it in, i
might not do it justice. But i
will give it a shot okay, so -

01:05:29.693 --> 01:05:32.093
<i> greg>></i> right here. It is
like that.

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:36.464
It is just
like, it is real long and deep
like 'uuuuuhhhhh'

01:05:36.466 --> 01:05:39.634
<i> lee>></i> I thought this was the
sound that she made. Not you.

01:05:39.636 --> 01:05:42.137
<i>Greg>></i> no that is the sound she
made yeah.

01:05:42.139 --> 01:05:42.137
<i>Michael>></i> that is the sound she
made!?

01:05:42.139 --> 01:05:51.713
<i> Older Michael narrating>></i> in
fact, Greg was borrowing details
from something he witnessed
through a keyhole one night.

01:05:55.085 --> 01:05:58.086
Gregs parents had invited
some of their friends over.

01:05:58.088 --> 01:06:01.957
They did this from time to
time apparently.

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:14.970
<i> Mother>></i> oh yeah

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:21.109
<i> mother>></i> who is first?

01:06:21.111 --> 01:06:22.978
<i>Random guy one>></i> oh - I am first

01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:38.126
<i>Lee and michael>></i> bitchin man.
Yeah man that is righteous.

01:06:38.128 --> 01:06:40.128
<i> Greg>></i> thank you. Thank you.

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:47.135
Yeah. No big deal. What about
you, man. What about your
lady Michael?

01:06:47.137 --> 01:06:49.137
<i>Lee>></i> I want to hear some dirty
shit.

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:51.373
<i> Michael>></i> okay, there is this
one time.

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:53.508
<i> Lee>></i> yeah, lets hear it.
<i> Greg>></i> yeah, ready for it.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.143
<i>Michael>></i> remember the Chandler
game?

01:06:55.145 --> 01:06:55.143
<i> Lee & greg>></i> yeah, yeah.

01:06:55.145 --> 01:06:59.481
<i> Michael>></i> well the party. The
party after the game.

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:02.550
You were not there but I went
with my older brother.

01:07:02.552 --> 01:07:06.788
And umm, it was all older chicks
there. And you know.

01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:12.327
Anyway, I was at this party and
i look across the room and I see
this girl.

01:07:19.169 --> 01:07:26.174
You know I was sitting all the
way across the room but somehow
we just keep locking eyes.

01:07:26.176 --> 01:07:32.180
And she is giving me this
real intense stare. She was so
beautiful man.

01:07:32.182 --> 01:07:38.186
I mean like, movie star eyes and
she is wearing this really cute
outfit.

01:07:38.188 --> 01:07:43.058
I glance down and I see shes got
these white panties on

01:07:45.194 --> 01:07:48.196
<i> greg>></i> so, uhh, what about the
white panties?

01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:51.433
<i> Michael>></i> so she found a way
to show them to me. Just me.

01:07:51.435 --> 01:07:55.170
<i> Greg>></i> damn!
<i>Lee>></i> like - did you do anything
about it? Come on.

01:07:55.172 --> 01:07:58.706
<i>Greg>></i> where are you going? That
is cool about the white panties.

01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:02.710
<i> Older Michael narrating>></i> the
story I told my friends was only
part of the truth.

01:08:02.712 --> 01:08:06.214
The white flash of the girl
underwear did something to me.

01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:11.119
I had to move, say something.

01:08:11.121 --> 01:08:14.122
<i> Greg>></i> so what did you do?

01:08:14.124 --> 01:08:22.096
<i> Michael>></i> well, I stand up and
i just go straight across the
room.

01:08:26.234 --> 01:08:30.537
<i> Michael>></i> I could tell she
wanted me to do something. So -
i reached out.

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:35.243
<i>Greg>></i> oh really? What did you
reach out for?

01:08:35.245 --> 01:08:37.479
<i> Michael>></i> well - I put my
finger there.

01:08:37.481 --> 01:08:39.447
<i>Greg>></i> where? Where did you put
it?

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:44.252
<i>Michael>></i> put it there. Right -
right fucking there. Right
there.

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:49.256
<i>Lee>></i> what happened from there?
Just leave her sitting. Come on.

01:08:49.259 --> 01:08:51.158
<i>Michael>></i> alright, okay. Let me
get to that.

01:08:51.161 --> 01:08:55.263
<i> Greg>></i> I am jealous - I would
love to hear it.

01:08:55.265 --> 01:09:01.136
<i> Older Michael narrating>></i>
because I was a virgin I could
no describe what I did with the
girl.

01:09:01.138 --> 01:09:03.270
What I described was a
landscape.

01:09:03.273 --> 01:09:05.173
Mountains.

01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:07.175
Fields.

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:09.277
The things around me.

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:13.281
I substituted the body of a
woman for the body of the earth.

01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:17.285
At least that is what I think i
did.

01:09:17.287 --> 01:09:23.658
We did not know exactly what we
were saying. But we knew we were
saying more than what was said.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:33.301
<i>Michael >></i> she wants it so. So i
gave it to her. You know. I gave
it to her real hard.

01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:36.604
You know, real fast. Deep, you
know.

01:09:36.606 --> 01:09:40.308
I do not think I could have
gotten deeper or gone harder.

01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:43.310
<i> Lee>></i> ahh, that is the best!

01:09:43.313 --> 01:09:46.314
<i> Michael>></i> yeah. And umm,

01:09:46.316 --> 01:09:57.225
when it was all over - I just
looked at her and then I left.

01:10:04.334 --> 01:10:14.342
<i> Greg>></i> that was a good story,
man. Yeah, that was great. Look
at us.

01:10:14.344 --> 01:10:16.744
<i>Lee>></i> umm, you guys want another
cigarette?

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:19.347
<i> Michael>></i> yeah.
<i>Greg>></i> it is about time for me.

01:10:19.349 --> 01:10:21.916
<i> Older Michael narrating>></i> we
talked into the night.

01:10:21.918 --> 01:10:26.354
Eventually we did hike the five
miles back into town to call a
locksmith.

01:10:26.356 --> 01:10:29.657
But for now we were
content to sit and smoke.

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:32.660
Three boys of no particular
distinction.

01:10:32.662 --> 01:10:39.367
Elevating as best we could, the
fragile faith that our lives
had meaning.

01:10:39.369 --> 01:10:46.374
<i> Keen narrating>></i> as much as
anything ever really happens,
this really did.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:55.383
<i> Keen narrating>></i> I guess you
could say I was in that drifting
phase...

01:10:55.385 --> 01:10:57.585
You can call it whatever
you want.

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:04.392
Somewhere between dropping out
of college and the beginning
of settling down.

01:11:04.394 --> 01:11:09.397
I was headed home for the
summer to straighten myself out.

01:11:09.399 --> 01:11:12.400
But took a detour.

01:11:12.402 --> 01:11:19.407
A couple thousand miles west of
my intended destination.

01:11:19.409 --> 01:11:24.412
<i>Keen>></i> I ended up at this house
in apex, Colorado.

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:24.412
My buddy clete was there.

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:36.424
Said he knew this girl that was
dog sitting for some rich folks
spending the summer in Scotland
or something.

01:11:36.426 --> 01:11:44.432
He said there was a full liquor
cabinet, stockpile of shrooms
and a free bed.

01:11:44.434 --> 01:11:48.436
So it seemed worth a pit stop

01:11:54.444 --> 01:12:00.448
god a lot of people lived in
that house over the summer.

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:06.954
It was actually hard to tell
who did and who did not on any
particular day.

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:12.660
I know, I cannot remember a lot
of their names.

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:18.466
Does it matter?
Well there was barnett.

01:12:18.468 --> 01:12:18.466
<i> Party goer one>></i> cause she
fucking squats when she pees.

01:12:18.468 --> 01:12:23.671
<i> Keen narrating>></i> you know
barnett was a special kind of
asshole, you know the type.

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:28.476
<i> Barnett>></i> hey, my man!
<i>Keen narrating>></i> see it was bad
to say, considering. But that
is the truth.

01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:31.846
<i> Barnett>></i> I do not know if i
like white women anymore. I do
not even know which one to pick.

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:35.783
You know what I am saying. I was
thinking about when I was
throwing rocks at a river.

01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:39.854
Anyway I would like to talk
to you about it more if you
got some time. Good shit.

01:12:42.492 --> 01:12:53.067
<i> Clete>></i> lions go after the
weak link. Always the baby
wildebeest, the retarded zebra,
the gimpy little antelope.

01:12:53.069 --> 01:12:57.505
Now, based on this evidence,
what do you think this movie is
called?

01:12:57.507 --> 01:13:01.509
"Lion: The noble beast"

01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:04.512
<i>keen>></i> still talking about that
fucking movie?

01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:08.516
<i> Clete>></i> it is a documentary.
And it is significant.

01:13:08.518 --> 01:13:14.522
<i> Keen narrating>></i> clete was
full of useful information from
public television.

01:13:14.524 --> 01:13:17.725
<i> Clete>></i> for you. Take them and
trip in good health.

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:23.731
<i> Keen narrating>></i> like the
cultural importance of baseball,
or the healing powers of magic
mushrooms

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:27.001
or the most effective methods of
hunting in the desert.

01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:30.438
See, those were the topics of
conversation that summer.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:39.514
And everyone was engaged in a
horse race for the dog sitter -
Lila.

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:49.557
<i> Lila>></i> you looking for
something?

01:13:49.559 --> 01:13:52.560
<i> Keen>></i> yeah, just some water.

01:13:52.562 --> 01:13:56.564
<i> Lila>></i> you are in the wrong
place, buddy.

01:13:56.566 --> 01:14:03.438
Whiskey and ice. It is my
specialty. Plus, it is all we
got left, so.

01:14:08.578 --> 01:14:13.581
<i>Keen narrating>></i> stu, nice guy,
had a flare or the near
overdose.

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:15.583
<i> Keen>></i> what is up with him?

01:14:15.585 --> 01:14:20.588
<i>Lila>></i> been like that or hours.
We do not know if it is drugs or
something

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:24.592
<i>keen>></i> or something? What do you
mean or something?

01:14:24.594 --> 01:14:31.632
<i>Lila>></i> I do not know. A million
things.

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:36.604
<i> Lila>></i> you bastards.

01:14:36.606 --> 01:14:42.677
<i> Keen>></i> I think we are all
bastards and saints. Just
depends on the day.

01:14:46.615 --> 01:14:51.486
<i> Lila>></i> you are quite profound
for someone from Ohio.

01:14:54.623 --> 01:15:04.499
<i> Keen narrating>></i> the way I saw
it I had two options. Turn tail
and head for home. Or throw my
hat in the ring.

01:15:49.244 --> 01:15:54.181
<i> Keen narrating>></i> I mean,
what would you do?

01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:09.597
<i>Keen narrating>></i> you cannot just
sit next to a girl and expect
her to unfold her life to you

01:16:09.599 --> 01:16:13.668
like it is a shirt she is asking
you to wear.

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:22.944
You have to show her that you
are giving something up in order
to talk to her.

01:16:24.947 --> 01:16:32.053
I am telling you, man. If you
want to get to the really
good stories, you have to make
an effort.

01:16:32.055 --> 01:16:34.355
<i>Lila >></i> high school,
the lady friend.

01:16:34.357 --> 01:16:38.292
<i> Keen>></i> uhh, what do you want
to know?
<i> Lila>></i> I want to know it
all.

01:16:38.294 --> 01:16:43.731
<i> Keen>></i> she was not especially
beautiful, but she was amazing
to talk to

01:16:43.733 --> 01:16:43.731
<i> lila>></i> so you never saw her
again?

01:16:43.733 --> 01:16:54.742
<i> Keen>></i> I kind of lost track of
her. But I did see her, yeah, at
our ten year reunion. Yeah.

01:16:54.744 --> 01:17:01.616
<i> Lila>></i> you went to your ten
year reunion...
<i> Keen>></i> yeah I did. Why?

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:09.624
<i> Lila>></i> no reason. I do not
know.
<i> Keen>></i> okay.

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:19.634
<i> Keen>></i> anyways she, she is
married to some guy who works
for NASA. Yeah.
<i> Lila>></i> fuck.

01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:26.073
<i> Keen>></i> they already had a kid.
And another one on the way.
<i> Lila>></i> wow.

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:32.680
<i> Keen>></i> yeah. The whole time i
kept thinking about how crazy
she used to be for me, you
know?

01:17:32.682 --> 01:17:38.285
How it could have been my
kid, calling me daddy.

01:17:38.287 --> 01:17:44.792
Like somehow I had given up my
chance to walk on the moon.

01:17:44.794 --> 01:17:50.131
<i> Lila>></i> it is not to late you
know. To walk on the moon.

01:17:50.133 --> 01:17:52.800
<i> Keen>></i> nah! I hate flying.
Always have.

01:17:52.802 --> 01:17:56.804
<i> Lila>></i> is that right?
<i> Keen>></i> uh huh.

01:17:58.808 --> 01:18:03.844
<i> Barnett >></i> pussies!
Pussies! Pussies!

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:06.947
<i> Barnett>></i> you are the
biggest pussy of them all.

01:18:06.949 --> 01:18:06.947
<i> Lila>></i> it is true.

01:18:08.985 --> 01:18:10.818
<i>Lila>></i> eww! Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:18:13.056 --> 01:18:15.723
<i> Keen>></i> fuck! Oww!

01:18:17.959 --> 01:18:23.698
<i>Clete</i> >> we can get five cents for these.
Wanna help me collect them?

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:30.838
<i> Clete>></i> what happened to him?

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.842
<i> Lila>></i> him or the other one?

01:18:34.844 --> 01:18:37.845
<i>Clete>></i> okay. This fucking guy.

01:18:59.868 --> 01:19:02.770
<i> Clete>></i> you coming?

01:19:02.772 --> 01:19:05.740
<i> Keen>></i> we cannot just leave
him out here.

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:10.344
<i> Clete>></i> well, wake him up.

01:19:23.893 --> 01:19:26.293
<i> Clete>></i> Jesus Christ.

01:19:26.295 --> 01:19:31.365
<i> Clete>></i> you could damage your
bladder holding your pee
that long.

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:47.815
<i> Keen>></i> fuck it, now what?

01:19:47.817 --> 01:19:51.819
<i> Clete>></i> you are on the
right track, maybe just
thinking a little too small.

01:19:51.821 --> 01:19:55.923
<i> Keen>></i> fuck head, come here.
Grab his arms I got an idea.

01:19:55.925 --> 01:19:58.793
<i> Clete>></i> oh shit. Yes sir,
yes sir.

01:20:01.931 --> 01:20:04.832
<i> Keen>></i> alright walk this way.

01:20:04.834 --> 01:20:09.937
<i> Keen & clete together>></i> one,
two, three!

01:20:16.946 --> 01:20:25.419
<i> Clete>></i> shit! Barnett wake up
you bastard! Wake up barnett!

01:20:29.958 --> 01:20:33.861
<i> Clete>></i> he is fucking around.

01:20:33.863 --> 01:20:36.831
<i> Clete>></i> barnett!

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:43.971
<i> Clete>></i> oh fuck!

01:20:55.984 --> 01:21:04.992
<i> Clete>></i> it is some consolation
that he was an asshole.

01:21:04.994 --> 01:21:08.996
<i>Clete>></i> but - what are you going
to tell Lila?

01:21:08.998 --> 01:21:13.868
<i> Keen>></i> nothing. We are not
telling Lila anything.

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:32.019
<i> Lila>></i> I cannot believe this.
Who dies??

01:21:32.021 --> 01:21:36.023
<i> Keen>></i> can you not say it like
that.

01:21:36.025 --> 01:21:39.026
<i> Lila>></i> like what?

01:21:39.028 --> 01:21:43.597
<i> Clete>></i> of all the days to run
out of fucking alcohol!

01:21:47.036 --> 01:21:50.905
<i>Lila>></i> did you check his pulse?

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:56.343
<i> Keen>></i> yeah.

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:15.562
<i> Lila>></i> do not tell stu. Do not
fucking tell anyone.

01:22:22.971 --> 01:22:26.040
<i>Lila >></i> promise me.

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:33.080
<i> Lila>></i> promise me!

01:22:33.082 --> 01:22:35.950
<i> Keen>></i> I promise.

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:25.132
<i>Keen narrating>></i> I do not think
Lila had any second thoughts
about being my girlfriend.

01:23:25.134 --> 01:23:37.011
I did not. But you know how it
is, you fall in love, you
cannot see beyond it.

01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:50.457
I guess that is where time,
it just, gets away from you.

01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:50.084
<i> Keen>></i> is that shit or vomit?

01:24:54.223 --> 01:24:58.092
<i> Clete>></i> this is damnation
territory.

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:07.101
<i>Keen>></i> I may have had something
to do with that.

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:27.121
<i> Stu>></i> should someone say a few
words?

01:25:34.262 --> 01:25:43.904
<i> Clete>></i> okay. Rest in peace.
Umm, yeah. Amen.

01:25:43.906 --> 01:25:52.146
<i> Clete>></i> okay. Rest in peace.
Umm, yeah. Amen.

01:26:15.303 --> 01:26:20.307
<i> Keen>></i> I think you should run
some water.

01:26:20.309 --> 01:26:31.318
<i> Lila>></i> there is an idea.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:35.189
<i> Keen>></i> that is my shirt you
know.

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:54.908
<i> Keen>></i> wanna get married?

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:06.220
<i> Lila>></i> my parents float me
some money every couple months.

01:27:07.355 --> 01:27:11.225
<i> Lila>></i> that could pay for
our marriage certificate.

01:27:24.372 --> 01:27:28.242
<i>Lila>></i> do you have any savings?

01:27:32.281 --> 01:27:37.251
<i> Keen>></i> do not worry I will buy
you a big old ring.

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:12.419
<i> Lila>></i> I guess I could go back
to waitressing.

01:28:12.421 --> 01:28:16.290
<i>Keen>></i> yeah, that would be good.

01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:11.478
<i> Keen>></i> good morning, sir.

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:17.484
<i> Sheriff>></i> morning - I hate
to bother you. But your wife
came by.

01:29:17.486 --> 01:29:21.488
<i> Sheriff>></i> said you murdered a
man?

01:29:21.490 --> 01:29:24.491
Keen narrating>>I mean it was
perfect.

01:29:24.493 --> 01:29:29.496
Keen narrating>>down to my damn
underwear. Glass of whiskey in
my hand.

01:29:29.498 --> 01:29:34.501
I just looked at him and said -
i would not call it murder.

01:29:34.503 --> 01:29:39.573
I realize now that was a slip.

01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:45.946
It is never easy to know what to
say in the moment, is it?

01:30:04.532 --> 01:30:08.402
You know, there is one last
thing that I remember.

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:18.779
So all the dogs in town, they
were barking at us when we
arrived that first night.

01:30:18.781 --> 01:30:23.450
Not knowing what we were getting
into.

01:30:23.452 --> 01:30:35.629
That I would murder a man.
Manslaughter a dog.
And fall in love.

01:30:35.631 --> 01:30:38.698
Despite what you might think.

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:52.612
Those fucking dogs. They would
not stop barking. What do you
think that means??

01:30:52.614 --> 01:30:59.486
Those fucking dogs. They would
not stop barking. What do you
think that means??

01:31:07.162 --> 01:31:14.100
<i> Narrator>></i> some character will
complain that his nowhere life
is everyone else fault.

01:31:14.102 --> 01:31:18.638
All you have to do is sit on
the wrong stool.

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:24.144
To get the good stories
you have to make an effort.

01:31:24.146 --> 01:31:29.216
You have to live them.
