00:33.765 --> 00:35.900
¶

01:23.082 --> 01:25.416
I just passed Latka
           on my way in.

01:25.450 --> 01:27.385
Guess who he is today?

01:27.419 --> 01:29.220
Poor Latka.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.288
I'll give you a hint.

01:30.322 --> 01:32.257
He's wearing
Savage Leather cologne.

01:32.291 --> 01:33.391
Oh, no, not him.

01:33.425 --> 01:35.826
(humming)

01:42.534 --> 01:44.269
(as Vic):
   Hey, beautiful co-workers.

01:44.303 --> 01:47.372
What a day it is to be young,
        gifted and Vic.

01:49.808 --> 01:52.644
You know, I'm getting
                   used to Latka

01:52.678 --> 01:54.279
with these multiple
                  personalities,

01:54.313 --> 01:57.715
but when he's Vic, he's such
          a slimy lounge lizard.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.317
Hiya, gorgeous.

02:00.319 --> 02:02.287
With exquisite taste.

02:02.321 --> 02:03.555
What?

02:04.623 --> 02:07.792
Oh, wow, bum me out again, man.

02:07.826 --> 02:10.562
Oh-oh. Oh, look at this, I'm not
     touching this machine.

02:10.596 --> 02:12.096
Latka? I mean, Vic?

02:12.131 --> 02:13.097
Yeah?

02:13.132 --> 02:14.432
Something wrong?

02:14.466 --> 02:15.833
Look at this.
I mean, look.

02:15.868 --> 02:18.135
I'm sorry to lose
my mellow, but I mean,

02:18.170 --> 02:19.537
I'm just getting sick
and tired

02:19.571 --> 02:22.774
of that little foreign wimp,
Latka Gravas.

02:22.808 --> 02:24.175
Pardon me?

02:24.209 --> 02:27.245
Look, I know you two are tight,
but look at this engine!

02:27.279 --> 02:29.948
Look at this.
It's filthy, it's a disgrace.

02:29.982 --> 02:31.316
I'm not touching that.

02:31.350 --> 02:33.318
Well, I wouldn't dress
    a wound in there, but...
Hey, look,

02:33.352 --> 02:35.720
is it fair that I have to do
both his work and mine?

02:35.754 --> 02:37.855
Well, offhand, I would say no,
        but, uh, I, I...

02:37.890 --> 02:39.924
Would you please
do me a favor?
                 What?

02:39.958 --> 02:42.226
Why don't you take little
Captain Crud aside sometime

02:42.261 --> 02:44.295
and teach him how
to operate a rag, okay?

02:44.329 --> 02:46.064
You want me to talk
                 to him for you?

02:46.098 --> 02:47.632
Yeah, I mean I would
do it myself...

02:47.666 --> 02:49.400
No, say no more, say no more.
      I'm confused enough.

02:49.435 --> 02:50.802
I'll talk to him.

02:50.836 --> 02:53.771
Hey, thanks, man.
You're a guy and a half.

02:53.805 --> 02:56.507
And you're at least that.

02:56.541 --> 02:59.210
Hey, guys, guess what?
I got a great new job!

02:59.244 --> 03:00.712
Congratulations.

03:00.746 --> 03:02.981
What are you going to be,
   a door-to-door simpleton?

03:03.015 --> 03:05.416
Listen to this.
I went to the employment agency

03:05.450 --> 03:07.518
just to see what they had...
                         Uh-huh?

03:07.552 --> 03:09.687
The guy sends me on an
 interview, and I get the job!

03:09.721 --> 03:11.222
Oh, you're leaving us?

03:11.256 --> 03:12.991
Oh, no, no, no, I'm gonna work
here, too. It's just part-time.

03:13.025 --> 03:14.259
A couple nights a week.

03:14.293 --> 03:15.660
Yeah, a little extra money
          can't hurt.

03:15.694 --> 03:17.462
Oh, no, I'm not doing this
      for the money, Alex.

03:17.496 --> 03:18.763
I need a change in my life.

03:18.797 --> 03:20.264
I'm getting tired
       of driving a cab,

03:20.299 --> 03:22.400
sitting all day in a cab,
    driving people all day,

03:22.434 --> 03:24.336
every day, day after day.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.136
So what's the new job?

03:25.170 --> 03:26.471
I'm gonna be a chauffeur.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.341
Talk about the Renaissance man.
           (chuckles)

03:30.376 --> 03:32.844
Great, Tony, go for it
      and don't look back.

03:32.878 --> 03:33.611
Who hired you?

03:33.645 --> 03:35.080
Oh, I haven't met her yet,

03:35.114 --> 03:37.182
but it's supposed to be some
   rich lady named Longworth.

03:37.216 --> 03:39.451
That's great, Banta.
             You be nice to her,

03:39.485 --> 03:41.452
and maybe she'll let
           you walk her poodles.

03:41.486 --> 03:44.489
Be real nice to her, maybe
she'll let you eat with them.

03:50.796 --> 03:54.766
(as Latka):
    Time to put my nose back
       on the grindstone.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.801
A-okay.

03:58.971 --> 04:01.072
Oh, uh, Latka?

04:01.106 --> 04:02.139
Yes, what is it, Alex?

04:02.173 --> 04:03.508
Good.
                           Uh...

04:03.542 --> 04:07.378
I uh, I'm really
                 not sure how to
                say this, Latka,

04:07.412 --> 04:11.216
uh, but, uh, I promised Vic
  that I would mention to you

04:11.250 --> 04:13.652
that he thinks that your engine
           is dirty.

04:13.686 --> 04:17.889
Oh, well, then, uh, let's take
a look and see, all right?

04:20.225 --> 04:21.858
Eh, what do you see?

04:21.892 --> 04:23.895
I see a lot of grease and oil.

04:23.929 --> 04:26.530
Oh, my! What a surprise.

04:26.565 --> 04:31.902
Grease and oil in an engine?
Are my eyes deceiving me?

04:31.937 --> 04:35.607
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

04:35.641 --> 04:36.974
Oh, oh, oh!

04:37.009 --> 04:43.415
Listen, Vic is a fussbudget
and a pain in the <i>yaktabe.</i>

04:43.449 --> 04:46.051
Like I said, I promised him
  that I'd mention it to you.

04:46.085 --> 04:48.353
Oh, well I understand,
and I appreciate it.

04:48.387 --> 04:50.321
And now you mention this
to him for me.

04:53.826 --> 04:54.859
I can't say that.

04:54.893 --> 04:57.395
All right. Well, then
mention this to him.

04:58.230 --> 04:59.564
Ah, better.

04:59.598 --> 05:01.466
That's more to the point,
            better.

05:09.007 --> 05:10.842
I can't wait to drive this car.

05:10.876 --> 05:12.043
Wow. Look at it.

05:12.077 --> 05:13.211
(whistles)

05:13.245 --> 05:14.578
Beautiful.

05:14.613 --> 05:16.047
Oh, yeah.

05:16.081 --> 05:17.315
Oh, I've got the door.

05:17.349 --> 05:19.117
Don't bother.

05:19.151 --> 05:20.919
Mrs. Longworth?

05:20.953 --> 05:22.153
Miss.

05:22.187 --> 05:23.721
Oh, you can call me
Christina.

05:23.755 --> 05:24.889
And you're?

05:24.924 --> 05:27.158
Very grateful.

05:27.192 --> 05:28.393
Oh, you mean my name.

05:28.427 --> 05:29.827
My name... My
                  name is, uh...

05:29.861 --> 05:31.262
My name. My name
                     is Anthony.

05:31.297 --> 05:33.231
Anthony.

05:37.903 --> 05:41.839
Anthony, is something wrong?

05:41.873 --> 05:44.108
If there is,
   I can't see it from here.

05:44.142 --> 05:47.044
Uh, I mean, nothing's
          wrong, ma'am, nothing.

05:47.078 --> 05:48.412
Everything is fine.

05:48.446 --> 05:51.883
And it was nice
                  of you to ask.

05:51.917 --> 05:54.852
And if there is anything wrong,
     don't be afraid to tell me,

05:54.887 --> 05:57.688
because I'm new at this, and
     you know, I might screw up.

05:57.723 --> 05:59.324
(sotto voce):
                     "Screw up."
             I don't believe it.

05:59.358 --> 06:01.626
Well, there is something.

06:01.660 --> 06:04.061
Oh, no. The hat.
       I'm sorry, ma'am.

06:04.095 --> 06:05.764
I know I should have taken
       it off before you got in.

06:05.798 --> 06:06.931
Where are my manners? Damn!

06:06.965 --> 06:08.099
Oh, I'm sorry about "damn."

06:08.133 --> 06:09.333
Anthony,

06:09.367 --> 06:11.102
the only thing
     I was going to suggest

06:11.136 --> 06:13.338
is that you just relax
         a little bit.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.707
I mean, I realize
    you're new at this job,

06:15.741 --> 06:17.275
but, really,
    you're doing just fine.

06:17.309 --> 06:20.578
Well... thank you.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.913
In fact, I think
you could so far

06:22.948 --> 06:24.982
as to pull away
from the curb now.

06:26.918 --> 06:28.185
TONY:
          Yes, ma'am.

06:30.755 --> 06:31.889
Now, then, tell me.

06:31.924 --> 06:34.459
Which do you prefer,
Anthony or Tony?

06:34.493 --> 06:36.460
I guess I prefer Tony, ma'am.

06:39.465 --> 06:42.133
And which do you prefer,
    uh, Christina or Peggy?

06:43.134 --> 06:46.103
Tony, Peggy is a nickname
for Margaret.

06:46.137 --> 06:47.505
My nickname is Tina.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.907
Oh. I'm always getting those
         two mixed. I'm sorry...

06:49.942 --> 06:51.576
Actually, everyone
calls me Christina.

06:51.610 --> 06:52.743
Yeah.

06:52.778 --> 06:55.145
Except my brother...
who calls me collect.

06:55.180 --> 06:56.914
(laughing)

06:56.949 --> 06:58.082
(sighs)

06:58.116 --> 07:00.184
Am I still doing
            good as a chauffeur?

07:00.218 --> 07:02.019
Oh I think
you're doing very well.

07:02.054 --> 07:04.254
Oh. I think so, too.

07:04.289 --> 07:06.691
I mean, it's, it's sort
          of like driving a cab.

07:06.725 --> 07:08.525
I mean, a lot
             classier, you know.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.128
But I feel right at home
         here in this limousine.

07:11.162 --> 07:12.630
(horn blaring,
       tires screeching)

07:12.665 --> 07:14.632
Hey, you, suck eggs!

07:16.001 --> 07:17.468
I'm sorry.

07:17.502 --> 07:19.336
I mean, uh...
                   I mean, uh...

07:19.370 --> 07:22.607
I mean, exercise some
      caution, will you, fellow?

07:29.581 --> 07:32.884
Yeah, Alex. I'm outside the
 governor's mansion right now.

07:32.918 --> 07:35.053
It's the classiest party
         I ever heard.

07:35.087 --> 07:36.955
(band playing slow jazz
          in distance)

07:36.989 --> 07:39.023
No, no, I can't see nothing
           from here.

07:39.091 --> 07:41.258
Yeah, but I met
  some real important people.

07:41.293 --> 07:43.227
Well, I don't want
         to brag, Alex.

07:43.261 --> 07:45.162
Well, but just
       to mention a few--

07:45.197 --> 07:47.665
the governor's chauffeur,
     the mayor's chauffeur.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.901
Yeah, it's a regular who's who.

07:49.935 --> 07:51.402
Hey, Alex, I got to go.

07:51.436 --> 07:52.637
I'll talk to you later.

07:52.671 --> 07:53.805
CHRISTINA:
Tony, we're going

07:53.839 --> 07:55.974
to drop Mr. Blakeley off
on the way home.

07:56.008 --> 07:57.141
Certainly.

07:57.175 --> 07:58.309
115 Central Park West.

07:58.343 --> 07:59.477
Right.

07:59.511 --> 08:01.445
(clears throat)

08:04.282 --> 08:05.617
(humming)

08:05.651 --> 08:08.219
Doug, I promised you
a ride home.

08:08.253 --> 08:09.420
Nothing else, okay?

08:09.454 --> 08:11.823
Okay.

08:15.126 --> 08:16.628
Doug!

08:16.662 --> 08:18.796
Christina, don't
               be so unfriendly.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.064
Doug, please stop.

08:20.098 --> 08:21.399
(Tony clears
                     his throat)

08:21.433 --> 08:22.967
(clearing throat loudly)

08:24.770 --> 08:26.304
You're making an ass
of yourself.

08:26.338 --> 08:28.238
She's right, Doug.

08:29.941 --> 08:31.376
Who are you?

08:31.410 --> 08:32.876
I'm Tony.

08:32.910 --> 08:34.645
Tony, mind your own business.

08:34.679 --> 08:37.148
Just drive the car.

08:37.182 --> 08:39.283
I will if you stop being rude.

08:39.317 --> 08:41.486
Christina and I are having
          a little disagreement.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.023
You had better keep
            your nose out of it.

08:45.057 --> 08:46.557
Okay.

08:46.592 --> 08:48.526
As long as you
                stop being rude.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.529
What if I don't
        stop being rude?

08:51.563 --> 08:54.198
Well, I guess I'll have
            to ask you to leave.

08:54.232 --> 08:55.633
Tell me something, Tony.

08:55.667 --> 08:59.103
What will you do when you ask me
     to leave and I don't?

08:59.137 --> 09:01.706
What, then, jerk?

09:01.740 --> 09:03.674
I don't know.

09:04.743 --> 09:06.677
I guess I'd
                break your face.

09:08.747 --> 09:11.181
All right, big talker,
      just stop this car.

09:11.216 --> 09:13.183
We'll see
     who breaks whose face.

09:13.218 --> 09:14.552
Guys, please.

09:14.586 --> 09:17.054
(brakes screeching)

09:17.088 --> 09:19.456
You want to step outside
         and settle this, right?

09:19.491 --> 09:20.758
You bet.
                     You got it.

09:20.792 --> 09:21.926
You got it.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.895
Yeah? Well,
                        get out.

09:25.430 --> 09:28.232
(tires screeching)

09:28.266 --> 09:29.767
That settled it.
(laughs)

09:29.801 --> 09:32.370
Just what would you have done
if that hadn't worked?

09:32.404 --> 09:34.572
I mean, he was
a lot bigger than you.

09:34.606 --> 09:35.840
Oh, I wasn't worried.

09:35.874 --> 09:38.375
I mean, size isn't nearly
    as important as ability.

09:38.410 --> 09:40.444
You know,
  I was a professional boxer.

09:40.478 --> 09:42.913
I've been beat up by guys
         half his size.

09:48.520 --> 09:52.122
So anyway, everyone said
     it was a terrible mismatch.

09:52.157 --> 09:53.858
I mean, Manzo was
              nationally ranked,

09:53.892 --> 09:55.359
and I was a
                  young unknown.

09:55.393 --> 09:57.728
See, his manager took
       the fight for a sure win.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.497
You know, make his
               record look good.

09:59.531 --> 10:01.198
Yes.
                   All right, so
               the fight starts.

10:01.232 --> 10:03.434
First round, Manzo
                 breaks my nose.

10:03.468 --> 10:06.003
For the next four rounds,
     he keeps going for it,

10:06.037 --> 10:08.072
hitting me in the face,
       bloodying my nose.

10:08.106 --> 10:11.074
Somehow I managed to stay
 on my feet round after round.

10:11.109 --> 10:13.176
The sixth round,
they finally stopped the fight.

10:13.211 --> 10:14.478
I win on a TKO.

10:14.513 --> 10:16.313
Manzo can't come out
         of his corner

10:16.347 --> 10:18.749
'cause I'm making him nauseous.

10:20.552 --> 10:22.286
That was a joke.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.788
Oh.
            (laughs)

10:23.822 --> 10:25.890
You know, like, a sportswriter
      wrote that about the fight

10:25.924 --> 10:27.124
'cause that's the
                  way it looked.

10:27.159 --> 10:29.160
But the fact was,
               I wore Manzo out.

10:29.194 --> 10:31.362
Was that the biggest fight
         you ever had?

10:31.396 --> 10:32.330
Oh, no.

10:32.364 --> 10:33.897
I once fought Ron Thomas.

10:33.932 --> 10:35.833
You know, in his prime,
       he was considered

10:35.867 --> 10:37.735
one of the best middleweights
          of all time.

10:37.769 --> 10:40.438
But by the time I fought him,
           he was 43.

10:40.472 --> 10:42.273
I mean, his
              reflexes were off,

10:42.307 --> 10:44.275
his timing was bad,
          his punches were weak.

10:44.309 --> 10:46.544
With a couple of breaks,
          I might have beat him.

10:46.578 --> 10:48.613
(laughs)

10:48.647 --> 10:49.880
That one was serious.

10:49.914 --> 10:52.216
Oh. I'm sorry.

10:52.250 --> 10:53.283
No, no, no, that's okay.

10:53.318 --> 10:55.552
Now that I think about
        it, it is kind of funny.

10:55.587 --> 10:57.121
You want to hear
                    another one?
        Yes.

10:57.155 --> 10:58.489
How about that?

10:58.523 --> 11:00.591
All these years
  of boxing finally paid off.

11:00.625 --> 11:03.360
I have amusing anecdotes.

11:30.355 --> 11:32.589
Vic!

11:34.226 --> 11:36.027
Oh, look at this.

11:36.061 --> 11:38.162
My sandwich.

11:41.032 --> 11:43.501
It was almost ruined.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.337
Oh...

11:46.371 --> 11:48.739
Are you still moping
over Christina?

11:48.773 --> 11:50.708
I'm not moping.

11:50.742 --> 11:52.376
It's just hard to
   chauffeur somebody around

11:52.410 --> 11:54.078
you're nuts about.

11:54.112 --> 11:56.814
I mean, we go to so many
     great places together.

11:59.117 --> 12:00.451
These could've been the greatest

12:00.485 --> 12:02.386
dates of my life
    if they had been dates.

12:02.420 --> 12:04.288
I'm never going to have
    better dates than these,

12:04.322 --> 12:05.790
and I never had these.

12:05.824 --> 12:07.158
Aw, Tony...

12:07.192 --> 12:09.160
"Aw, Tony"?
You understood that?

12:09.194 --> 12:10.494
No.

12:10.529 --> 12:13.063
But he looks so sad.

12:13.097 --> 12:15.866
I'm obsessed with her, Alex.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.635
I can't get her out of my mind.

12:17.669 --> 12:19.770
She's the classiest lady
          I ever met.

12:19.805 --> 12:22.139
She's like a princess,
     she's like a goddess,

12:22.173 --> 12:25.309
she's like a Vegas showgirl.

12:25.343 --> 12:28.679
Tony, Tony, why don't,
   why don't you ask her out?

12:28.713 --> 12:30.781
I can't do that, Alex,
           I'm just a chauffeur.

12:30.815 --> 12:32.783
I mean, she's nice to me,
            but she's nice to me

12:32.817 --> 12:34.085
the way she's nice
                to the gardener,

12:34.119 --> 12:35.686
the way she's nice
      to the housekeeper,

12:35.721 --> 12:37.555
the way she's nice to the cook.

12:37.589 --> 12:39.891
She's so nice.

12:39.925 --> 12:43.661
But I'll bet that she thinks
 of you as more than help, too.

12:43.695 --> 12:44.728
Oh, yeah.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.597
When was the last time
      you ended an evening

12:46.631 --> 12:49.466
by telling your date
        to wax the car?

12:49.500 --> 12:54.705
Tony, give it time.

12:54.807 --> 12:58.576
Love has a way
    of creeping up on folks.

12:58.610 --> 13:01.078
I once lived
with a woman

13:01.112 --> 13:04.748
for three years
 before I realized I loved her.

13:07.185 --> 13:10.487
In fact, I lived with her

13:10.522 --> 13:14.658
for three years before I
   realized I lived with her.

13:17.395 --> 13:19.730
What a woman.

13:19.765 --> 13:22.166
I might have married her.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.534
Why didn't you?

13:23.568 --> 13:26.370
I said I might have.

13:26.405 --> 13:28.840
I don't remember.

13:28.874 --> 13:31.708
Tony, Tony, listen to me,
                   listen to me.

13:31.743 --> 13:33.443
Don't wait.

13:33.478 --> 13:34.745
I mean, the longer you wait,

13:34.780 --> 13:35.913
the harder it is for her

13:35.947 --> 13:38.082
to think of you
                as not the help.

13:38.116 --> 13:39.349
You know,
he's absolutely right.

13:39.384 --> 13:41.018
You have got to ask
her out right now.

13:41.052 --> 13:43.153
I can't do that, man.
           ALEX: Why?

13:43.187 --> 13:45.790
I want her so bad but
         she's out of my league.

13:45.824 --> 13:48.392
And I'm not going after
      no more pipe dreams.

13:48.426 --> 13:49.860
I can't take that again.

13:49.895 --> 13:51.161
What do you mean, again?

13:51.195 --> 13:52.596
Oh, you guys know,
         I was a boxer.

13:52.630 --> 13:54.365
I wanted to be
     champion of the world.

13:54.399 --> 13:55.833
So, I spent 13 years of my life

13:55.867 --> 13:57.501
wanting and chasing
 something that I'd never get.

13:57.535 --> 13:59.403
All I get is
    an empty feeling for it.

13:59.438 --> 14:00.905
No more longshots.

14:00.939 --> 14:02.773
Tony, you're not
      a quitter, are you?

14:02.807 --> 14:05.076
No, I'm no quitter, Alex,
 but what am I supposed to do?

14:05.110 --> 14:06.176
Well, we'll help you, all right?

14:06.210 --> 14:07.678
We'll show you,
      I mean, if need be,

14:07.712 --> 14:09.146
we'll go over everything
         step by step.

14:09.180 --> 14:11.114
But you're going to get
 the girl of your dreams, Tony.

14:11.149 --> 14:12.750
That's right.

14:12.784 --> 14:14.352
Oh, come on guys, I mean,
she goes out with guys

14:14.386 --> 14:16.086
that take her
to Broadway openings.

14:16.121 --> 14:17.788
You know, the 21, the Met.

14:17.822 --> 14:19.356
How am I supposed
to compete with that?

14:19.390 --> 14:20.791
So, you don't compete.

14:20.825 --> 14:22.193
Tony, you do
        something better.

14:22.227 --> 14:23.727
You do something
    that is uniquely you.

14:23.761 --> 14:25.229
That's right.
Like what?

14:25.263 --> 14:26.363
Well, wait a minute,
            wait, wait,

14:26.398 --> 14:27.598
let's just think about it.

14:27.632 --> 14:29.300
Let's just think
                       about it.

14:29.334 --> 14:30.634
I got it!

14:30.668 --> 14:31.835
How about boxing?

14:31.870 --> 14:32.970
Great!
                           Good!

14:33.004 --> 14:34.438
That's unique, Tony.

14:34.472 --> 14:36.807
But for God's sake,
        go easy on her.

14:51.489 --> 14:54.024
Tony, I got a great
                idea for a date.

14:54.058 --> 14:56.160
And it won't even
                  cost you much.

14:56.194 --> 14:58.729
Oh, one of my most
       romantic memories

14:58.763 --> 15:00.131
was the time when
       my date showed up

15:00.165 --> 15:02.165
with a large picnic basket
     and a bottle of wine,

15:02.200 --> 15:06.337
and he took me on the Circle
 Line cruise around Manhattan.

15:06.371 --> 15:09.606
Oh, it was
    a beautiful spring day.

15:09.641 --> 15:11.909
I fell in love with him
        that afternoon.

15:11.943 --> 15:13.677
Yeah? How'd it turn out?

15:13.711 --> 15:15.379
Oh, not so good.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.748
I married him.

15:17.782 --> 15:19.050
Great.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.217
Boxing's out.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.019
A picnic basket
      and a cruise is in.

15:22.053 --> 15:24.154
Hey, you know what would
    be fun to do after that?

15:24.189 --> 15:25.456
Take her ice-skating.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.491
Oh, I don't know, Alex, I mean,

15:27.525 --> 15:29.727
I've never been ice skating,
       I might fall down.

15:29.761 --> 15:31.495
Oh, that's cute as hell.
                           ALEX:
                           Yeah.

15:31.529 --> 15:33.631
I could, I could fall.

15:34.799 --> 15:39.436
Banta, this is touching
      a chord in my heart.

15:39.470 --> 15:40.604
I've been through this,

15:40.638 --> 15:42.573
and I want to pass
            something on to you.

15:42.607 --> 15:45.008
I was once in love with a woman

15:45.042 --> 15:47.378
who was so sophisticated

15:47.412 --> 15:49.346
and so refined

15:49.381 --> 15:51.849
that it seemed to make
         her unattainable to me.

15:51.883 --> 15:55.018
Oh, yeah, the prison guard.

15:55.954 --> 15:57.988
No, no, no, not her.

16:00.758 --> 16:02.526
This was a ballerina.

16:02.561 --> 16:04.728
She was gorgeous.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.763
And classy.

16:06.798 --> 16:11.034
When she did a grand <i>jete,</i>
 it could make you cry.

16:11.069 --> 16:13.370
But I persevered
and I won her heart.

16:13.404 --> 16:15.505
Really? How, Louie?

16:17.742 --> 16:20.043
I know a spot
on a woman's body

16:20.078 --> 16:22.145
that turns her to jelly.

16:28.553 --> 16:30.821
Well, if that works so
     great for you, Louie,

16:30.855 --> 16:33.624
why aren't you constantly
 surrounded by beautiful women?

16:33.658 --> 16:36.093
Because it's not an
            easy spot to get to.

16:45.203 --> 16:47.304
Take off your right shoe, Nardo.

16:47.338 --> 16:49.340
Drop dead.

16:49.374 --> 16:53.077
See, I told you it was
    a tough spot to get to.

16:53.111 --> 16:56.179
Come by later and I'll,
   uh, tell you some secrets.

16:56.214 --> 16:59.282
You too, Casanova.

16:59.317 --> 17:01.685
Hey, come on, so, so, what
      do I do after ice-skating?

17:01.720 --> 17:03.020
You know, to sort of
            cap off the evening.

17:03.054 --> 17:04.088
Right.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.356
Uh, drop by my place.

17:06.390 --> 17:09.460
I'm having a luau.

17:09.493 --> 17:10.795
Thanks, Jim, but, uh,

17:10.829 --> 17:12.628
you wouldn't know when
      we'd be dropping by.

17:12.663 --> 17:14.865
It doesn't matter,
I'm always having a luau.

17:14.898 --> 17:17.800
Now, look, Tony, I think
  you're pretty well set now.

17:17.835 --> 17:19.036
What do you mean set, Alex?

17:19.069 --> 17:20.171
You guys said you were
        going to tell me

17:20.204 --> 17:21.738
what to say and how to say it.

17:23.307 --> 17:25.842
(as Vic):
         ¶ Here I come
      to save the date. ¶

17:25.876 --> 17:28.444
(chuckling)

17:28.480 --> 17:32.049
Okay, Tony,
         I got a line for you.

17:32.083 --> 17:34.084
You use this little
goodie, and I promise

17:34.118 --> 17:36.887
it'll be full speed ahead
from "Can I buy you a drink?"

17:36.921 --> 17:38.889
to "How do you
like your eggs?"

17:38.923 --> 17:40.791
I'll write it down for you.

17:40.825 --> 17:43.327
No, no, no, Tony,
   you don't need any lines.

17:43.361 --> 17:44.562
I don't have any lines.

17:44.596 --> 17:46.663
Or any women, either,
eh, Mahatma?

17:46.697 --> 17:50.267
Here, Tony.

17:50.302 --> 17:53.237
Read your lady
this poem I wrote.

17:53.271 --> 17:56.840
Hey, a poem is a good idea.

17:56.875 --> 18:01.011
"How much love I gave
to those I never loved.

18:01.045 --> 18:06.716
"How, hoping for
what I never knew

18:06.751 --> 18:11.821
and finding it with
my heart, Christina."

18:11.856 --> 18:15.292
Yikes! This don't
                     even rhyme.

18:15.326 --> 18:18.829
That's right,
I was hoping it did.

18:18.863 --> 18:22.866
Tony, the very things that
  you've told us about Christina

18:22.900 --> 18:24.835
are the very things that
            you should tell her.

18:24.869 --> 18:26.203
That's right,
               that's right.

18:26.238 --> 18:27.738
Aw, yeah, sure.
          No, Tony, it is.

18:27.772 --> 18:30.641
I mean like, like, like that I
 can't stop thinking about her?

18:30.675 --> 18:32.342
You want to go out
with Christina?
                           Yeah!

18:32.376 --> 18:34.110
Then all you have to do
is go to her and say,

18:34.145 --> 18:35.312
"I want to go out with you."

18:35.346 --> 18:36.713
I want to go out with you.

18:36.747 --> 18:38.916
Yeah.
           I like it.

18:38.950 --> 18:40.084
I'll do it.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.618
Oh, but I'm going to
       chicken out, Alex.

18:41.652 --> 18:43.020
Don't chicken out.

18:43.054 --> 18:44.388
Don't.

18:44.422 --> 18:46.089
Got that covered,
        too, huh, Alex?

18:46.124 --> 18:47.324
All right.

18:47.358 --> 18:48.926
I'll do it,
   I won't let you guys down.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.627
We can't miss.
Okay, go to it.

18:50.661 --> 18:53.696
Oh, yeah, how's this?

18:53.731 --> 18:56.267
I fixed the poem.

18:56.301 --> 18:59.570
It rhymes.

18:59.604 --> 19:04.508
"How much love I gave
to those I never loved.

19:04.542 --> 19:10.481
"How cold is your hand
when not properly gloved.

19:10.515 --> 19:13.217
"Hoping for what I never knew,

19:13.251 --> 19:16.487
"The sky is blue,

19:16.521 --> 19:18.955
and finding it
with my heart...

19:18.990 --> 19:23.127
And here comes
the hardest part,

19:23.161 --> 19:29.366
"Christina, which I like
even better than Wheatina."

19:32.403 --> 19:33.937
Well, it's a start, Jim.

19:33.972 --> 19:35.305
Okey-doke.

19:35.339 --> 19:37.274
Thanks, guys.
ALEX:
Okay, okay.

19:41.179 --> 19:42.146
TONY (sotto voce):
            <i>Ask her.</i>

19:42.180 --> 19:43.747
I just want to go out with you.

19:43.781 --> 19:46.016
I want to go out with you.

19:46.050 --> 19:47.083
Oh, that's easy.

19:47.118 --> 19:49.253
I want to go out with you.

19:49.287 --> 19:50.487
Oh, let me help you.

19:52.356 --> 19:54.225
Here.

19:57.862 --> 19:59.796
Thank you.

20:01.032 --> 20:02.366
(takes deep breath)

20:02.400 --> 20:03.934
Christina, here it is.

20:03.968 --> 20:06.136
Well, I think they
liked your designs.

20:06.171 --> 20:07.771
Congratulations.
             Thanks.

20:07.805 --> 20:10.073
I'll have Accounting send them
a material cost breakdown.

20:10.108 --> 20:12.609
Tell them I'm working on
    a new design for spring.

20:12.643 --> 20:14.077
Fine, but could you
do me a favor?

20:14.112 --> 20:16.547
Could you try to keep
material cost down this time?

20:16.581 --> 20:18.448
The cost is your
     department, isn't it?

20:18.482 --> 20:20.317
Yeah, but it would be
easier for us both

20:20.352 --> 20:21.919
if you'd just consider
the cost up front.

20:21.953 --> 20:24.121
I'll do that.

20:24.155 --> 20:26.323
See you later.

20:26.358 --> 20:28.559
See you later.
                            Bye.

20:35.233 --> 20:36.767
Christina, I...

20:36.801 --> 20:38.936
Christina, I can't go on
with this charade anymore.

20:38.970 --> 20:40.971
I was wrong about
everything, I'm sorry.

20:42.206 --> 20:43.373
I love you.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.741
I need you.

20:44.776 --> 20:45.809
Marry me.

20:47.679 --> 20:49.213
Oh, yes, Nick.

20:49.247 --> 20:51.848
Yes.

21:09.134 --> 21:11.801
Christina, will you
                 go out with me?

21:24.482 --> 21:27.050
Oh, guys, don't be
     so hard on yourselves.

21:27.085 --> 21:28.318
I mean, you meant well.

21:28.352 --> 21:30.154
And you were right,
      I had to go for it.

21:30.188 --> 21:31.921
You can't give up
        on your dreams.

21:31.956 --> 21:33.991
Romance never works out.

21:34.025 --> 21:35.993
Only in fiction.

21:36.027 --> 21:39.029
I want to live in fiction.

21:39.063 --> 21:41.631
It wouldn't even have to
be "Wuthering Heights."

21:41.666 --> 21:45.168
I'd settle for
"Nancy and Sluggo."

21:45.202 --> 21:47.237
I'll get over this.

21:47.271 --> 21:49.039
We'll all get over this.

21:49.073 --> 21:51.374
This is not
    my first disappointment.

21:51.409 --> 21:53.577
The first time my heart was
 broken was in the ninth grade,

21:53.611 --> 21:55.412
and I got over it.

21:55.446 --> 21:57.814
A couple of years ago.

21:57.848 --> 22:01.085
Ah, the worst part of it is, I
 feel like I let everybody down.

22:01.119 --> 22:02.752
No, it's not your fault,

22:02.787 --> 22:04.455
No.
            it's nobody's fault.

22:04.489 --> 22:05.789
We're just depressed
                         because

22:05.823 --> 22:07.991
there's no romance
              left in the world.

22:08.025 --> 22:12.696
Don't be too sure.

22:16.534 --> 22:19.336
I've got a date with an angel.

22:22.006 --> 22:26.676
Funny thing...

22:26.711 --> 22:29.880
I've known her for years.

22:29.914 --> 22:35.452
She didn't know I was alive
       until last night.

22:35.486 --> 22:38.922
I tried the stuff
    we've been telling Tony.

22:38.957 --> 22:40.857
Worked like a charm.

22:52.036 --> 22:55.172
Well, we're going out tonight

22:55.206 --> 22:58.041
collecting aluminum cans.

23:01.879 --> 23:04.647
Crazy world.

23:05.650 --> 23:07.150
¶ Oh, love always...

23:21.332 --> 23:23.733
(theme song playing)

23:46.991 --> 23:48.458
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:48.492 --> 23:49.459
(man grumbling)
