<i>Three hundred years ago,
we helped build New Orleans.</i>

00:11.311 --> 00:13.689
<i>Now, we've returned
to find a city at war.</i>

00:15.582 --> 00:19.359
<i>The vampire Marcel leads an army
against a coven of desperate witches.</i>

00:21.255 --> 00:26.603
<i>My brother Klaus is playing against
both sides, hungry for power</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:29.434
<i>and hoping to protect
the werewolf carrying his child.</i>

00:29.596 --> 00:31.701
<i>But Marcel has an advantage.</i>

00:31.865 --> 00:35.438
<i>He holds our brother Elijah captive
with the aid of a secret weapon.</i>

00:36.169 --> 00:38.945
<i>Now, in order to get back
the brother I love,</i>

00:39.106 --> 00:42.053

with the one I cannot trust.</i>

ELIJAH: <i>August 1359.</i>

00:48.215 --> 00:50.786
<i>I have noticed a
difference in my siblings.</i>

00:53.754 --> 00:57.292
<i>Our bond strains beneath the
pressure of our life as vampires.</i>

00:58.625 --> 01:02.095
<i>Each day removes them further from
the humanity we once possessed.</i>

01:03.463 --> 01:07.240
<i>My sweet sister Rebekah has grown
quite indifferent to brutality.</i>

01:10.137 --> 01:13.482
<i>However, the true problem remains,
my brother Niklaus.</i>

01:17.945 --> 01:20.892
<i>He continues to hide
his loneliness with cruelty.</i>

01:23.450 --> 01:26.260
<i>Still, I cling to the hope that I,
as their eldest brother,</i>

01:26.420 --> 01:28.127
<i>can lead them
down the correct path.</i>

01:29.723 --> 01:32.795
<i>A path charged with the power
of a family united.</i>

01:35.829 --> 01:40.471
<i>For if I fail, our family's legacy
will end in darkness.</i>

01:42.169 --> 01:44.672
I cannot believe you disposed
of those vampires without me.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.840
You know how I love
to set things on fire.

01:47.007 --> 01:49.578
Was I supposed to leave them
in the front yard to rot?

01:49.743 --> 01:52.155
Besides, they were my responsibility.

01:52.312 --> 01:55.191
They attacked the helpless, pregnant girl
who's carrying my child.

01:55.349 --> 01:59.661
Oh, I am so moved by your
newfound sense of fatherly duty

01:59.820 --> 02:02.300
towards the werewolf carrying
your hybrid bun in her oven.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.696
The werewolf would like
to know what the plan is.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.102
Well, that depends
what plan you mean, love.

02:10.263 --> 02:11.765
My plan for global domination

02:11.932 --> 02:14.879
or Rebekah's plan to find love
in a cruel, cruel world.

02:15.168 --> 02:16.476
(CHUCKLES)

02:17.337 --> 02:19.783
The plan to rescue Elijah.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.351
You know, the good brother,

02:21.508 --> 02:22.953
the one who is now
in the possession

02:23.110 --> 02:25.613
of your mortal enemy after
you stabbed him in the back.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.725
In the front,
if we're being specific.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.519
You two said that
you would get him back.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.685
So is there a plan, or what?

02:33.120 --> 02:34.463
Okay-

02:35.022 --> 02:38.401
Well, firstly,
Marcel is not my mortal enemy.

02:38.558 --> 02:43.064
He's my friend, albeit one who is
unaware that I am trying to sabotage

02:43.230 --> 02:45.972
his hold over the supernatural
community of the French Quarter,

02:46.133 --> 02:47.544
but a friend nonetheless.

02:47.701 --> 02:52.878
And secondly, I daggered Elijah
in order to gain Marcel's trust.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.644
If I had known he would
place my brother

02:54.808 --> 02:57.220
in the hands of a particularly
nasty teenage witch,

02:57.377 --> 02:59.914
I certainly would have weighed
my options a bit differently.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.491
And thirdly, sister, please.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.685
And thirdly, the plan,
as you have demanded,

03:03.850 --> 03:06.763
is for Niklaus to simply ask
Marcel for Elijah back.

03:09.589 --> 03:12.160
That's not the whole plan, is it?

03:12.325 --> 03:14.362
Oh, please.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.599
Klaus may be a miserable
excuse for a sibling,

03:16.763 --> 03:18.606
but there is none
more diabolical.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.913
That's only the plan "A," love.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.878
There's always a plan "B."

03:24.438 --> 03:26.543
And what's plan "B"?

03:28.075 --> 03:29.713
War.

Hey, Klaus, for the love

06:36.029 --> 06:37.269
Much longer than you'd think,

compel Originals.

27:37.222 --> 27:39.725
I guess this is the moment
I remember I know better.

28:02.347 --> 28:04.190
We found this at his girl's place.

28:12.424 --> 28:13.994
Still my friend, huh?

28:14.526 --> 28:15.869
That's funny,

28:15.928 --> 28:17.271
because it looks to me
like that little witch of yours

28:17.396 --> 28:19.433
got her hands on a spell
that I keep locked away.

28:19.598 --> 28:21.669
Marcel, I have never seen that.
- Shut up.

28:21.833 --> 28:24.279
I see on your hand, you still have
the daylight ring I gave you.

28:24.436 --> 28:27.076
So, what would you need with
the recipe for making new ones?

28:27.239 --> 28:28.718
Unless maybe you and Katie
were gonna go off

28:28.774 --> 28:30.253
and start a little kingdom
of your own?

28:30.342 --> 28:32.948
Marcel, no.
- Here's a lesson in friendship.

28:33.111 --> 28:35.455
Friends don't lie to me,
they don't break my rules,

28:35.614 --> 28:37.958
and they do not steal what is mine.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.775
For the crime of murdering
one of his own,

28:54.933 --> 28:58.608
I sentence Thierry Vanchure
to 100 years in the garden.

29:02.975 --> 29:04.818
And it begins.

29:20.559 --> 29:21.936
You're doing the right thing.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.005
It's the only way to find Elijah.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.671
I'm doing what I have to do.

- I can keep going.
- You can't. She'll sense it.

31:11.169 --> 31:13.376
No. I can find Davina.
I just need another moment.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.118
You may be willing to die
to get your witch back,

31:17.275 --> 31:19.118
but Hayley and the baby
will die with you.

31:19.277 --> 31:22.281
Elijah will never forgive us,
and rescuing him will be for nothing.

31:24.950 --> 31:27.453
It's over.
We failed.

No. Katie.
No, no, no.

No.

31:58.316 --> 31:59.818
Just tell me this.

32:02.154 --> 32:03.633
Was she worth it?

32:05.323 --> 32:06.961
I loved her.

32:09.494 --> 32:10.905
Unh!

32:15.834 --> 32:19.008
Seal him up and let him rot.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.004
How much did Cami see?

32:53.472 --> 32:55.213
She just saw an argument, mate.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.543
It's nothing you can't fix.

33:02.047 --> 33:03.720
You really like her, don't you?

33:04.716 --> 33:06.992
I like that she's not
a part of any of this.

33:09.287 --> 33:11.961
Sometimes it's good to see the
world the way the humans do.

33:16.862 --> 33:19.172
I am sorry about Thierry,
you know?

33:21.032 --> 33:22.978
I can tell he was a good friend.

33:23.068 --> 33:24.172
(SIGHS)

33:24.236 --> 33:26.045
I made him what he was.

33:26.204 --> 33:27.706
Obviously, my trust was misplaced.

33:27.873 --> 33:29.511
Doesn't make it easier.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.661
You saved me tonight.
I guess I owe you one.

33:41.219 --> 33:42.892
You asked for your brother back.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.762
Seems like the least I can do.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.563
- Cami--
- Don't even try it.

34:14.719 --> 34:15.754
I get the bro code.

You're here to smooth things over
for your friend.

34:18.956 --> 34:20.094
It's very nice of you, but--

34:20.257 --> 34:21.565
But you've been hurt before,

34:21.726 --> 34:23.967
and you aren't taking
any more chances.

34:24.129 --> 34:25.574
Something like that.

34:26.764 --> 34:30.303
The guy I saw tonight?
Not the guy I thought he was.

34:32.938 --> 34:34.610
And if he can turn
on a dime like that...

34:34.773 --> 34:37.083
Sounds like more than
just a broken heart.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.049
Someone broke your trust.

Wow.
I totally misread that.

35:12.143 --> 35:16.819
No. You read it quite well,
but we all have our roles to play.

35:20.352 --> 35:23.196
You went to Marcel's.
You danced.

35:23.355 --> 35:26.427
You feel badly that he
had a row with his friend,

35:26.591 --> 35:31.199
but otherwise, all you remember
is that it was perfect.

(PLAYS NOTES ON PIANO)

35:44.609 --> 35:47.055

On the contrary, sister.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.388
Tonight was a masterpiece.

35:51.549 --> 35:54.826
Are you mad? Katie died before
Sophie could complete the spell.

35:55.020 --> 35:57.899
I'm well aware.
I killed Katie.

35:59.224 --> 36:00.828
You what?

36:00.992 --> 36:03.063
There's no way our
little suicide witch

36:03.228 --> 36:06.573
wasn't gonna try and take out
Marcel with her.

36:06.731 --> 36:10.144
I saved his life,
and in doing so,

36:10.301 --> 36:13.976
I now have him exactly
where I want him.

36:14.139 --> 36:16.380
Sophie trusted you.

36:16.541 --> 36:19.988
I trusted you against
all my better instincts.

36:20.145 --> 36:21.886
Wake up, Rebekah.

36:23.915 --> 36:26.156
The witches are on no one's side
but their own.

36:26.317 --> 36:29.230
This girl, Davina,
that's all they want,

36:29.387 --> 36:32.493
and when they have her, what do
you think happens then, a truce?

36:33.358 --> 36:37.329
Of course not. They will use
Davina's power against all of us.

36:37.495 --> 36:40.203
Even if you're right,
the plan was to find Elijah,

36:40.365 --> 36:42.038
and you failed us.

36:43.234 --> 36:44.941
You always did lack faith.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.544
By protecting Marcel,
I've cemented his trust,

36:48.707 --> 36:52.120
so much so that he's agreed
to return Elijah to us.

36:53.511 --> 36:57.118
And when the time is right,
when he has told me everything

36:57.282 --> 37:01.628
I need to know about Davina,
I will have her for myself.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.898
I have all the faith in the world
that you'll get what you want, Nik.

37:09.060 --> 37:13.566

him his brother back.

- No.

were dangerous.

until I know how to kill them.
