WEBVTT

00:19.270 --> 00:23.108
<i>When the public found out
about the excessive lifestyle</i>

00:23.316 --> 00:25.193
<i>of the prisoners at La Catedral,</i>

00:25.276 --> 00:29.322
<i>the police began an investigation
into the supposed capital crimes</i>

00:29.406 --> 00:32.492
<i>being committed by Pablo Escobar
within the prison walls.</i>

00:32.575 --> 00:36.746
<i>The central part of this investigation
involves the disappearance</i>

00:36.830 --> 00:38.873
<i>of Gerardo Moncada and Fernando Galeano.</i>

01:32.927 --> 01:34.554
MURDERS AT LA CATEDRAL?

01:35.597 --> 01:38.933
Mr. President,
I just spoke with the attorney general.

01:39.017 --> 01:43.772
Moncada's wife reported
his disappearance from La Catedral.

01:43.855 --> 01:47.233
It's clear that Escobar
killed those men in that prison.

01:48.735 --> 01:52.947
- I don't think he'd take it that far.
- Escobar is capable of anything.

01:53.031 --> 01:56.034
But you know what?
This could be a good opportunity for us.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.203
Forgive me, Eduardo...

01:58.286 --> 02:02.290
but I'm having a hard time
finding the silver lining in all this.

02:03.833 --> 02:07.337
This is our opportunity
to end Pablo's vacation.

04:33.399 --> 04:36.778
- Boss.
- Good morning, boss.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.218
Good morning, boss.

05:02.762 --> 05:04.138
Bad news.

05:22.949 --> 05:25.034
Have the bodies disappeared?

05:37.005 --> 05:40.133
Our agreement with him states
he can't be moved to another prison.

05:40.216 --> 05:44.762
Excuse me, but killing people in prison
is a direct violation of our agreement.

05:44.846 --> 05:46.889
Yes, yes, but we have to tread carefully.

05:47.098 --> 05:50.309
If he feels we're violating his terms,

05:50.518 --> 05:53.146
he'll start putting bombs
on street corners again.

05:53.354 --> 06:00.319
Let's tell him we've uncovered threats
against him from his biggest enemies.

06:00.403 --> 06:03.614
That would give us the opportunity
to bring him to Bogota'

06:03.698 --> 06:06.367
while we improve security at La Catedral.

06:10.455 --> 06:12.999
The fourth brigade,
commanded by General Ariza,

06:13.082 --> 06:15.418
would be the best choice
to carry out this operation.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.587
- Ariza?
- Yes, sir.

06:17.670 --> 06:20.590
- Is he from Medellin?
- Yes, sir.

06:25.845 --> 06:28.222
Can we trust him?

06:28.431 --> 06:30.141
Yes, sir.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.420
I'm calling him.

07:46.175 --> 07:49.262
Don Pablo, here...
Tata's on the phone.

07:53.975 --> 07:57.603
I was just thinking
there's nothing in the world I'd love more

07:57.687 --> 07:59.522
than to hear my wife's lovely voice.

07:59.730 --> 08:01.941
Pablo, what's happening?

08:02.024 --> 08:04.569
<i>Why would something be happening here?</i>

08:04.652 --> 08:05.820
The soldiers.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.030
Soldiers?

08:08.114 --> 08:12.118
<i>Lots of them.
Headed to the prison right now.</i>

08:12.201 --> 08:13.744
<i>I don't know, Pablo.</i>

08:15.454 --> 08:17.373
<i>Tell me what's happening.</i>

08:18.624 --> 08:21.169
No, my love, it's nothing.

08:21.252 --> 08:22.920
Everything is cool.

08:26.716 --> 08:28.801
I'll call back soon, all right?

08:30.928 --> 08:32.847
I love you, baby.

08:34.974 --> 08:36.475
Yes, my love.

08:50.198 --> 08:53.326
- Get out the weapons.
- As you wish, sir.

09:22.521 --> 09:23.648
Listen up, company!

09:23.856 --> 09:28.361
You will be under the command
of Lieutenant Dominguez.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.781
Let's secure the perimeter.

09:31.864 --> 09:35.034
Tell your men
they have orders to shoot anyone

09:35.117 --> 09:39.330
- trying to leave the prison, understood?
- As you wish, General.

09:39.538 --> 09:40.581
Dismissed.

09:42.917 --> 09:46.003
- Juan Pablo, where are you going?
- I'm going to the jail to help Dad.

09:46.087 --> 09:48.631
- No, dear, you can't go there now.
- I said I want to go!

09:48.714 --> 09:52.426
- Juan Pablo, your father's fine.
- He needs you to stay here

09:52.510 --> 09:55.429
to look after your sister.
Isn't that what he always says?

09:55.638 --> 09:59.350
- But the soldiers are going to kill him.
- Don't ever say that in this house!

09:59.558 --> 10:01.352
- They're going to kill him!
- Quiet!

10:51.610 --> 10:53.279
Boss?

10:53.362 --> 10:55.072
They're gonna try to take you out of here

10:55.156 --> 10:58.159
and look for evidence
on Moncada and Galeano.

10:58.242 --> 11:00.786
If I leave this place,
someone will kill me.

11:02.121 --> 11:06.417
Or the Americans will use their power to
restore extradition and send me to the US.

11:09.754 --> 11:12.381
What the fuck,
let's give those bastards lead.

11:12.465 --> 11:15.051
- Are you fucking crazy?
- Yeah, we can take them, Don Pablo.

11:15.134 --> 11:16.927
For every one of our men,
they have 20.

11:17.136 --> 11:20.014
- Let's do it now.
- Don't be an idiot. Wait for the boss!

11:20.097 --> 11:22.808
Stop bickering in front of the boss.

11:23.017 --> 11:25.227
We have the escape routes.

11:25.436 --> 11:28.773
We could get into the hills
before they even know we're gone.

11:36.405 --> 11:38.574
There is a time to fight...

11:39.825 --> 11:41.952
and there is a time to be clever.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.497
Yes, sir.

11:46.123 --> 11:49.877
- What's your plan?
- Let's talk to Gaviria.

11:49.960 --> 11:55.633
Be smart.
Try to settle this matter peacefully.

11:58.636 --> 12:00.346
If that fails?

12:56.152 --> 12:59.321
General Ariza
has orders to secure Escobar.

12:59.405 --> 13:03.534
I want you to go there
and legalize his transfer to Bogota'.

13:03.617 --> 13:07.079
- What do you mean, "legalize" it?
- Formalize it.

13:07.163 --> 13:09.832
You'll reiterate
that this is a temporary relocation

13:09.915 --> 13:13.085
while we renovate La Catedral
to make it safer for him.

13:13.169 --> 13:15.129
We both know that's not true.

13:16.005 --> 13:20.926
But it's what you'll tell Escobar
until he's safely inside a military brig.

13:21.844 --> 13:22.887
Yes, Mr. President.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.389
What's wrong?

13:29.059 --> 13:30.853
I've got a bad feeling about this.

13:31.061 --> 13:34.440
Eduardo... I trust you,

13:34.523 --> 13:39.236
and this is too important to leave
to someone I don't trust completely.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.409
I'm at your service,
Mr. President.

13:45.493 --> 13:47.328
You know that very well.

13:47.411 --> 13:51.457
Nothing will make me happier than to see
this asshole get the justice he deserves.

14:40.089 --> 14:44.969
Tell the boys in the comuna to stay quiet
until further notice. Understand?

14:45.052 --> 14:47.596
All right. What else do you have?

14:50.307 --> 14:51.767
- I know that.
- Velasco.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.435
I'll call you back.

14:54.645 --> 14:56.146
Yes, boss?

14:57.189 --> 14:59.024
What's happening outside?

15:01.151 --> 15:03.028
We don't know.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.872
I fucked up.

15:14.582 --> 15:16.166
What's that, boss?

15:19.044 --> 15:20.879
Gather the boys.

15:23.173 --> 15:27.511
And tell the prison guards they're
to fire on anyone who tries to come in.

15:30.598 --> 15:33.601
Boss, do you think the prison guards
will follow your orders?

15:34.476 --> 15:37.563
They'd better. I hired them.

15:39.315 --> 15:43.277
Excuse me. Boss, the people
from Medellin just informed me

15:43.360 --> 15:46.905
that some guy named
Eduardo Sandoval is on his way.

16:16.602 --> 16:19.897
Good evening.
Where is General Ariza?

16:19.980 --> 16:22.024
General!

16:22.107 --> 16:24.234
Let him through.

16:24.318 --> 16:26.153
Good evening, General.

16:27.988 --> 16:31.116
- Mr. Vice Minister.
- How are you?

16:31.200 --> 16:32.910
Pleasure to see you. Good evening.

16:32.993 --> 16:37.039
- Where's Escobar?
- Escobar?

16:37.122 --> 16:39.708
Inside the prison, obviously.

16:39.792 --> 16:41.835
What do you mean,
he's in the prison?

16:41.919 --> 16:44.880
I thought you were taking him into custody
when you arrived.

16:44.963 --> 16:48.509
I'm sorry, sir,
but those were not my orders.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.719
Then what were your orders?

16:50.803 --> 16:54.682
My orders were to secure the perimeter,
not let anyone in or out,

16:54.765 --> 16:56.475
and wait for you.

16:57.393 --> 16:59.603
That is not what the president believes.

16:59.687 --> 17:03.107
He's not going to be happy
to hear Escobar isn't in your custody.

17:03.190 --> 17:06.026
I'm sorry,
but those were my orders.

17:08.570 --> 17:13.909
I turned myself in to that punk...
the vice minister of justice.

17:16.704 --> 17:20.249
But since there is
no justice in this country,

17:20.332 --> 17:22.459
he is the vice minister of nothing.

17:27.131 --> 17:28.757
This is good.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.137
Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.

17:37.266 --> 17:39.059
This is very good.

17:41.019 --> 17:44.857
General, I don't believe
you understand your orders clearly.

17:44.940 --> 17:48.819
- But I do.
- Wait a second, sir, where are you going?

17:48.902 --> 17:51.530
I'm going to try
to make a miracle happen.

17:51.613 --> 17:55.492
I'm going in there to convince Escobar
this is a temporary transfer of location.

17:55.576 --> 17:59.204
And I'm also going to say
that I'm here to guarantee his safety.

17:59.288 --> 18:02.499
I can't allow you
to put yourself in danger.

18:03.375 --> 18:06.754
Do you think that Escobar is dumb enough
to kill the vice minister of justice

18:06.837 --> 18:11.425
right in front of the fourth brigade?
For God's sake.

18:12.134 --> 18:15.220
At least let me make a call
so they don't shoot you when you walk in!

18:15.304 --> 18:18.849
Make it fast. Open the door.
You two are coming with me.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.936
Didn't you hear me?
Open the door! General!

18:23.020 --> 18:25.522
Listen to the vice minister! Hurry up!

18:25.606 --> 18:26.774
Open it.

18:47.628 --> 18:49.546
Vice Minister, good evening.

18:50.547 --> 18:53.300
Pablo is waiting for you. Go on.

18:55.636 --> 18:57.095
Wait here.

19:05.646 --> 19:07.773
Good evening, Vice Minister.

19:09.233 --> 19:11.235
It's been a while.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.657
Good evening.

19:18.909 --> 19:22.037
I'm here on behalf of President Gaviria.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.082
My orders are to escort you
to a temporary prison in Bogota'.

19:25.290 --> 19:28.544
The government has decided to make
some improvements here at La Catedral

19:28.627 --> 19:31.129
for your safety and everyone else's here.

19:33.340 --> 19:37.928
I would think Gaviria
could come up with a more believable lie.

19:40.639 --> 19:44.893
I know why you're here.
Because of Moncada and Galeano.

19:44.977 --> 19:47.437
But I didn't kill those men.
That story is a lie.

19:47.646 --> 19:51.525
And why should the government care
about some dispute between gangsters?

19:51.733 --> 19:53.360
We don't care about that.
You're mistaken.

19:53.443 --> 19:57.072
He's betraying me, Vice Minister.
Gaviria is betraying me.

19:57.281 --> 20:02.494
If your safety is a concern,
I will gladly escort you out myself.

20:02.578 --> 20:06.832
We have an agreement,
and you're breaking it.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.585
What guarantee do I have
that the Americans won't kidnap me

20:09.668 --> 20:11.211
and take me to the US?

20:12.462 --> 20:15.299
Bush would be very happy
to stick me in a gringo jail,

20:15.382 --> 20:18.635
like he did to Lehder,
like he did to Noriega, right'?

20:18.719 --> 20:20.596
That's not gonna happen,
you have my word.

20:20.679 --> 20:22.222
Your word.

20:24.808 --> 20:27.561
As vice minister of justice?

20:28.729 --> 20:32.774
Yes. I give you my word
as vice minister of justice.

20:32.983 --> 20:37.404
Haven't you noticed that the army
has completely surrounded this jail?

20:39.364 --> 20:42.367
We can end this peacefully,

20:42.451 --> 20:45.954
if you just cooperate
and walk out with me.

20:46.163 --> 20:48.373
Don Pablo,
these bastards will kill you!

20:53.337 --> 20:56.423
I respectfully decline your offer,
Vice Minister.

20:56.632 --> 21:02.721
The press is saying I killed those men,
but that's a lie to sell newspapers.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.977
If Gaviria wants me out of here...

21:11.021 --> 21:15.484
he can come here...
and do it himself.

21:18.028 --> 21:20.113
Meanwhile...

21:20.197 --> 21:26.119
I'll view any incursion
as a declaration of war.

21:40.592 --> 21:43.345
I'll inform the president
of your decision.

21:47.891 --> 21:49.351
Excuse me.

22:00.988 --> 22:03.073
Mr. Vice Minister.

22:05.200 --> 22:09.246
Why walk all that way
when I have a telephone in my office?

22:14.292 --> 22:17.546
I'd rather call the president
from outside the prison, thanks.

22:22.384 --> 22:23.969
Let me out!

22:25.387 --> 22:29.725
Surely your mother taught you
never to turn down a polite invitation.

22:33.687 --> 22:36.440
My mother taught me
an invitation is optional.

22:36.648 --> 22:40.527
I hope you'll forgive me
for making this invitation mandatory.

22:41.778 --> 22:46.366
It's not every day we're honored with the
presence of a vice minister of justice.

22:51.121 --> 22:52.622
Come on, Vice Minister.

22:52.831 --> 22:55.083
Calm down, let's go.

24:00.357 --> 24:03.318
What's taking this guy so long?

24:05.195 --> 24:10.534
General, with all due respect, I don't
think we should've let him go inside.

24:13.036 --> 24:14.746
No.

24:14.830 --> 24:18.959
I don't think Pablo is stupid enough
to fuck with the vice minister.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.644
Can I get you something to drink?

24:37.853 --> 24:40.230
I don't need anything.

24:40.313 --> 24:43.024
Look, don't be so nervous.

24:45.152 --> 24:49.281
As soon as you have the president
on the phone, you will make it clear

24:49.489 --> 24:54.536
that if he doesn't remove the troops
surrounding the prison immediately,

24:54.619 --> 24:57.455
there will be grave consequences.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.294
But if he withdraws the troops,

25:02.377 --> 25:06.464
we'll stay here quietly
and complete our sentence.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.396
Good evening,
President Gaviria's office.

25:21.479 --> 25:25.275
<i>It's Eduardo, vice minister of justice.
I need to talk to the president.</i>

25:25.358 --> 25:26.902
One minute, please.

25:34.075 --> 25:36.036
Mr. President,
excuse the interruption.

25:36.119 --> 25:38.914
There is a call from
Vice Minister Sandoval on line three.

25:39.915 --> 25:42.292
- Thank you, Maria.
- Excuse me.

25:52.177 --> 25:53.178
Hello?

25:55.055 --> 25:56.473
<i>Hello?</i>

26:01.436 --> 26:02.938
How long will I be here as a hostage?

26:03.146 --> 26:07.776
<i>You are not my hostage.
You are my guest.</i>

26:17.202 --> 26:20.247
Escobar has Sandoval inside the prison.

26:20.330 --> 26:22.540
Hang up right now, Mr. President.

26:22.624 --> 26:25.168
- Hang up, please.
- I need to know if he's OK.

26:25.252 --> 26:26.503
Mr. President, hang up the phone.

26:26.586 --> 26:29.798
If Escobar knows you're on the line,
he might force you to strike a bargain.

26:30.006 --> 26:32.509
<i>Or worse, if you lie to him,
he might kill Eduardo.</i>

26:32.717 --> 26:35.178
Hang up the phone. Sir!

26:43.687 --> 26:44.771
Leave us alone.

26:50.819 --> 26:53.154
- They hung up.
- Bullshit.

26:53.238 --> 26:54.781
Shut up!

26:59.703 --> 27:01.121
So, then...

27:02.664 --> 27:06.876
the president is too busy
to speak with me.

27:08.670 --> 27:11.047
I don't understand
how he ended up in that jail.

27:11.256 --> 27:13.133
Me, either.
I don't know what Sandoval is doing.

27:13.341 --> 27:16.303
What did he think, that he could convince
Escobar he was there to help him?

27:16.386 --> 27:19.848
We agreed that Ariza
would have Escobar in custody.

27:20.056 --> 27:22.642
Ariza must've had his reasons
for holding off.

27:23.893 --> 27:26.604
- Right.
- This is a very delicate situation.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.107
You can be sure Escobar's men are armed.

27:29.190 --> 27:34.195
Please, I suggest we call DAS
to bring in a hostage negotiation team.

27:35.071 --> 27:36.990
Do I have your permission?

27:40.243 --> 27:41.411
Good.

27:46.583 --> 27:49.753
Maria Clara,
connect me with DAS, immediately.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.838
No. No.

27:51.921 --> 27:53.340
Cancel the call.

27:55.133 --> 27:59.179
- This time, we will not negotiate.
- I don't understand, Mr. President.

28:00.388 --> 28:02.223
If Sandoval dies...

28:04.100 --> 28:06.728
I will have it on my conscience
for the rest of my life.

28:06.936 --> 28:10.774
But my country comes first,
and I will not empower Escobar.

28:10.982 --> 28:16.905
Send in the Special Forces...
and finish this, once and for all.

28:21.034 --> 28:23.828
<i>I just realized something.</i>

28:24.037 --> 28:28.708
The president didn't just betray me...

28:29.709 --> 28:31.419
he also betrayed you.

28:33.213 --> 28:36.216
He knew if you came here...
Look at me.

28:36.299 --> 28:38.134
...there would be three options.

28:38.218 --> 28:42.680
One: I leave with you, peacefully.

28:42.764 --> 28:46.351
Two: I take you hostage.

28:46.559 --> 28:50.146
Three: I shoot you,

28:50.230 --> 28:55.360
and then he really
would have a good reason to kill me.

28:55.443 --> 28:56.611
Right?

29:05.412 --> 29:08.206
Either way, he wins. Right?

29:08.415 --> 29:11.835
Maybe the president is betraying us both.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.878
You could be right.

29:13.962 --> 29:15.880
But you know something?

29:15.964 --> 29:19.843
I'll sacrifice my life
to make sure you're dead.

29:27.684 --> 29:31.813
You think you're better than me,
but you're wrong.

29:34.941 --> 29:37.360
I come from nothing.

29:38.361 --> 29:41.906
I fought hard to become what I am.

29:46.536 --> 29:49.330
If the government hadn't come after me...

29:50.498 --> 29:55.211
I would be where you are now...
the vice minister of justice.

29:57.630 --> 30:01.342
You and I are nothing alike.

30:02.385 --> 30:04.429
You are a criminal.

30:05.388 --> 30:07.682
And criminals can't run forever.

30:10.351 --> 30:11.519
Sir.

30:25.408 --> 30:30.455
Your friend Gaviria has ordered
Special Forces to raid the prison

30:30.538 --> 30:33.082
while you're still inside.

30:35.126 --> 30:37.128
I would have done the same thing.

31:00.985 --> 31:02.195
Don't kill him.

31:03.988 --> 31:10.328
If he dies... it will be
at the hands of his own government.

31:17.335 --> 31:19.212
Good luck, Vice Minister.

37:42.261 --> 37:44.805
Sir, I have her on the line.

37:49.268 --> 37:51.354
- Hello, my love.
- Hello.

37:51.437 --> 37:55.608
Look, we're having a little problem here.

37:55.691 --> 38:00.529
We're trying to solve it,
but you know what to do...

38:01.530 --> 38:03.574
if it doesn't work out, right?

38:03.658 --> 38:05.201
<i>Yes, Pablo.</i>

38:06.077 --> 38:07.745
I love you very much.

38:09.538 --> 38:10.873
Me, too.

38:11.874 --> 38:14.502
- Very much.
- <i>Goodbye, my love.</i>

38:39.944 --> 38:41.946
We are bandits.

39:08.973 --> 39:12.560
- Wait a minute! What is this?
- Your brigade is no longer in charge!

39:24.655 --> 39:27.700
You've gotta get me out of here,
do you understand?

39:27.783 --> 39:29.702
Come on, come on.

39:48.679 --> 39:52.016
- Hurry up!
- Get down! No! Get in there!

40:13.788 --> 40:15.831
Don't move, don't move!

40:32.389 --> 40:33.849
- All clear!
- All clear!

40:33.933 --> 40:35.976
- All clear!
- All clear!

40:58.124 --> 41:00.584
- Stop, stop!
- It's me, it's me, it's me.

41:00.793 --> 41:05.131
Keep low, and no matter what happens,
keep moving.

41:15.641 --> 41:17.184
Speak.

41:17.268 --> 41:19.270
Yes, it's him.

41:19.353 --> 41:21.981
Speak up, please, I can't hear you.

41:22.189 --> 41:23.732
Is that confirmed?

41:24.942 --> 41:26.485
Wait a minute.

41:28.028 --> 41:33.033
Mr. President, they stormed the prison.
Sandoval's been freed.

41:36.662 --> 41:38.497
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

41:44.336 --> 41:45.796
And Escobar?

41:53.637 --> 41:55.222
Look what we found.

42:03.522 --> 42:05.232
Do you think he's OK?

42:06.442 --> 42:09.612
I'm sure he's fine.

42:32.927 --> 42:34.595
See you tomorrow.

42:35.846 --> 42:37.139
Good night.
