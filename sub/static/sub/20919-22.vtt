10:58.216 --> 10:59.716
Vision, you all right?

10:59.718 --> 11:01.809
You know this poc poc?

11:01.887 --> 11:03.477
She is the one
I was sent to find.

11:03.555 --> 11:05.738
She is Dr. Jane Foster.

11:05.815 --> 11:08.741
Folks call me
Calamity Jane Foster.

11:08.818 --> 11:10.226
I'm the sheriff
around these parts.

11:10.228 --> 11:12.837
And I saw these scofflaws
trying to ventilate you.

11:12.914 --> 11:16.991
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!
Easy there, lawman lady.

11:17.068 --> 11:19.326
Everybody's cool now.
See? See? Friends.

11:19.404 --> 11:22.496
Me, Groot, robot guy.

11:22.574 --> 11:23.831
I am Vision.

11:23.909 --> 11:25.166
Yeah. Vision and us.

11:25.243 --> 11:26.243
Same side.

11:28.930 --> 11:30.914
Terrific. Maybe the four of us

11:30.916 --> 11:32.076
will actually stand a chance.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.100
[roaring]

11:35.587 --> 11:36.861
[roaring]

11:40.016 --> 11:41.274
I am Groot.

11:41.350 --> 11:45.370
That does not appear to be
a domesticated dinosaur.

11:45.447 --> 11:47.247
[Jane] No such thing as
a domesticated T. Rex.

11:51.694 --> 11:53.161
[roaring]

11:57.959 --> 11:59.667
I am Groot!

12:04.207 --> 12:05.381
I am Groot!

12:09.045 --> 12:10.045
I am Vision.

12:10.121 --> 12:11.220
I am Groot.

12:16.052 --> 12:17.627
Come and get me,
ya filthy lizard!

12:17.629 --> 12:18.728
Yaah!

12:27.305 --> 12:28.821
I am Vision.

12:28.898 --> 12:29.898
I am Groot.

12:39.667 --> 12:41.593
What are they doing?

12:41.669 --> 12:43.309
It's a corral.
Get the T. Rex to chase us.

12:50.586 --> 12:52.011
Hurry up, lawman lady!

12:52.088 --> 12:53.088
Hyah!

12:57.426 --> 12:58.434
I am Vision.

13:07.603 --> 13:09.512
[laughing] I am Groot.

13:09.514 --> 13:11.347
I am Vision.

13:11.349 --> 13:14.350
Nice bit of wrestling
there, boys.

13:14.352 --> 13:15.952
Now, Vision, why
were you looking for me?

13:19.874 --> 13:21.916
The robots are back.
Everyone find cover now!

13:23.528 --> 13:24.794
[screaming]

13:27.549 --> 13:29.474
So it's come to this.

13:29.551 --> 13:34.128
[sighs] Risking my life to
defend the lives of humans.

13:34.205 --> 13:38.057
Loki, my friend, you are
a long way from Asgard.

13:38.134 --> 13:40.371
Any other day, I'd be more than willing
to let them destroy this town.

13:40.395 --> 13:44.397
But not today,
for today I am an Avenger!

13:44.473 --> 13:46.825
[echoing]
venger, venger, venger!

13:51.556 --> 13:52.624
Here's the ladder
up to your usual spot.

13:52.648 --> 13:54.724
Oh, great. And then what?

13:54.726 --> 13:58.227
Come on, Wasp. I'm no good
in a fight without my eyes.

13:58.229 --> 13:59.912
Kind of in the job description.

13:59.989 --> 14:02.398
You still have ears, Hawkeye.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.083
[scoffs]
There's no Hawkeye here,

14:04.160 --> 14:06.344
just blind Clint Barton.

14:06.421 --> 14:08.996
All right. Fine.

14:09.074 --> 14:10.406
No one's gonna blame you
if you sit this one out.

14:10.408 --> 14:13.092
There's a door behind you.
Get inside and take cover.

14:13.169 --> 14:16.262
But if you pick up that bow,
you're an Avenger.

14:18.416 --> 14:19.416
That's the ladder.

14:21.344 --> 14:22.544
[mocking] "That's the ladder."

14:25.106 --> 14:26.106
[grunts]

14:29.352 --> 14:30.352
That sounded like a hit!

14:35.024 --> 14:38.359
You were right. This is
a whole lot of space junk.

14:38.436 --> 14:40.786
Told ya.

14:40.863 --> 14:42.605
If you got robot hordes
going after that town,

14:42.607 --> 14:43.956
they're coming from here.

14:44.033 --> 14:45.866
There is something

14:45.944 --> 14:47.443
projecting an immense
energy signature

14:47.445 --> 14:49.128
a few hundred yards
in that direction.

14:49.205 --> 14:50.205
[explosion]

14:57.122 --> 14:59.472
I think we found
our Kree Conquest Hive.

14:59.548 --> 15:01.715
I wish. Ordinary robot factory

15:01.793 --> 15:03.384
we could maybe take down.

15:03.461 --> 15:05.628
What we're seeing
is a Hive Queen,

15:05.630 --> 15:06.812
and it's on the move!

15:11.560 --> 15:13.319
Uh... Uh... Aah!

15:13.396 --> 15:14.528
Aah! [Panting] Aah!

15:17.809 --> 15:19.659
Aah!

15:19.735 --> 15:22.069
I am Groot! [Explosion]

15:22.147 --> 15:24.147
Yeah. We all got eyes!

15:24.149 --> 15:25.829
Hive Queen's gonna
wipe out the whole town!

15:28.820 --> 15:30.044
[townspeople shouting]

15:35.418 --> 15:36.418
[woman] Oh!

15:41.166 --> 15:42.941
Everyone, fall back
to the infirmary.

15:43.017 --> 15:45.168
You heard the good doctor.

15:45.170 --> 15:48.688
Run! As fast as your little
mortal legs will carry you!

15:50.508 --> 15:52.191
Oop. There you are.

15:58.607 --> 15:59.687
What's happening out there?

16:02.520 --> 16:03.664
The mother of all monster robots

16:03.688 --> 16:05.279
just joined the party.

16:05.356 --> 16:07.523
Well, I can't hear
over the noise.

16:07.525 --> 16:09.245
No way to make pinpoint targets.
[screaming]

16:12.197 --> 16:13.972
Can you picture
a clock in your head?

16:14.048 --> 16:15.789
Well, yeah,
but what's that gonna...

16:15.867 --> 16:17.967
I'm your eyes. 3:00 high. Fire.

16:22.390 --> 16:23.815
Did... Did I get it?

16:23.891 --> 16:26.709
Uh... That good, huh?

16:26.711 --> 16:28.711
Okay. New plan.

16:28.713 --> 16:31.439
Shooting down.
1:00, 5:00, and 10:00. Fire.

16:38.647 --> 16:41.167
Still need to figure out what we're
gonna do about that big one.

16:50.401 --> 16:52.159
I am Groot!

16:52.237 --> 16:53.177
What are you babbling about?

16:53.254 --> 16:55.162
You need an army
to stop a Hive Queen.

16:55.240 --> 16:59.575
Even then, your chances are
zero and close to zero.

16:59.577 --> 17:01.260
An army, huh?
I know where we can get one.

17:01.337 --> 17:02.337
Come on.

17:10.922 --> 17:13.105
Townspeople are holed up
in the infirmary.

17:13.182 --> 17:14.742
We must keep the robots
away from there.

17:16.778 --> 17:17.778
Hawkeye, move!

17:17.853 --> 17:20.279
Gonna have to be more specific!

17:20.356 --> 17:21.931
We're about to... Aw, forget it!

17:21.933 --> 17:25.101
Wasp, what is going on? Jump!

17:25.103 --> 17:26.210
Oh, gaah! Uhh! Uhh!

17:31.609 --> 17:36.054
Well, our situation is not
too much worse than before.

17:36.130 --> 17:38.056
Okay, now what?

17:38.132 --> 17:40.040
I see it,
and I don't believe it.

17:40.118 --> 17:41.726
I think the cavalry's arrived.

17:52.297 --> 17:53.297
[grunts]

17:54.723 --> 17:58.134
Sheriff, pleased to see
you in good health.

17:58.136 --> 18:00.016
I can't leave this town
for five minutes, can I?

18:01.322 --> 18:04.731
Huh? Loki? Here?

18:04.809 --> 18:06.659
Apparently,
Loki is an Avenger now.

18:06.735 --> 18:08.586
Of course he is.

18:08.663 --> 18:10.871
I guess I won't
blast him... yet.

18:18.323 --> 18:19.246
Forget the little ones.

18:19.324 --> 18:21.582
If we don't stop the Queen,

18:21.659 --> 18:23.219
it'll just keep making
more attack bots.

18:24.495 --> 18:26.345
I am Groot!

18:33.596 --> 18:34.946
[grunting]

18:52.039 --> 18:53.879
The mortals inside...
They have nowhere to run.

18:56.194 --> 18:58.302
Eh, I got one blast arrow left.

19:00.214 --> 19:02.381
And I've got an idea.

19:02.458 --> 19:04.291
Get that arrow ready, Avenger.

19:04.369 --> 19:07.219
That arrow will
not produce a blast

19:07.296 --> 19:08.440
strong enough
to destroy the Hive Queen.

19:08.464 --> 19:10.797
Our odds of success now are...

19:10.875 --> 19:12.541
Never tell me the odds.

19:12.543 --> 19:14.377
Hawkeye, shoot!

19:14.379 --> 19:16.136
At what?

19:16.214 --> 19:18.606
At me! At my voice! Shoot now!

19:31.896 --> 19:33.829
So that sounded good.

19:35.917 --> 19:37.008
Sure did, Avenger.

19:41.239 --> 19:44.182
Why? What did you do to it?

19:44.258 --> 19:45.999
[sniffing]
It's not hemlock, is it?

19:46.077 --> 19:48.186
It's a peace offering.

19:48.262 --> 19:49.854
The Avengers trust you,
so I will, too.

19:53.175 --> 19:54.675
But if you step out of line,

19:54.752 --> 19:56.919
I will bring the wrath
of Jane Foster

19:56.921 --> 19:58.521
down on your butt
like a force of nature.

20:01.108 --> 20:02.274
Cheers.

20:04.687 --> 20:05.761
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:05.763 --> 20:08.364
may I present one Hawkeye,
nearly healed.

20:09.934 --> 20:12.359
Ah, you're a fast healer.

20:12.437 --> 20:13.878
Told you you'd be
back on your feet.

20:13.955 --> 20:16.772
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you did.

20:16.774 --> 20:18.031
Thanks for the pep talk.

20:18.109 --> 20:20.943
Everybody needs one
sometimes. Even you.

20:20.945 --> 20:25.556
I speak for everyone when I say
thank you for saving the town.

20:25.633 --> 20:27.225
And with things safe,

20:27.301 --> 20:28.226
me and the doc
can go back with you

20:28.302 --> 20:30.286
to Avengers Tower.

20:30.288 --> 20:31.062
Which means I can
officially resign

20:31.138 --> 20:33.305
as town sheriff.

20:33.382 --> 20:34.457
Yeah. You primates
are all settled,

20:34.459 --> 20:36.216
but what about us?

20:36.294 --> 20:37.614
Me and Groot
are still stuck here.

20:39.630 --> 20:42.314
A reward?

20:42.391 --> 20:44.300
There's money
in hunting down bad guys?

20:44.302 --> 20:46.727
Yep. A few straggler
fugitive robots

20:46.804 --> 20:49.396
got away into the desert.

20:49.474 --> 20:51.234
Real reward for anyone
who can round them up.

20:52.477 --> 20:54.418
[chuckles]

20:54.495 --> 20:56.737
You are now looking
at the new sheriff

20:56.814 --> 20:58.422
and deputy of Timely Township.

21:00.818 --> 21:04.244
I am Groot, huh?

21:04.322 --> 21:06.413
No. I'm the sheriff.
I said it first.

21:06.491 --> 21:08.173
Me! Stop it! Stop it!

21:08.250 --> 21:09.600
I mean it! Stop!

21:09.677 --> 21:11.176
[growling]

21:14.849 --> 21:16.849
Got to say, this beats walking

21:16.925 --> 21:18.236
all the way back
to Avengers Tower.

21:18.260 --> 21:21.337
In the movies, the heroes
ride into the sunset

21:21.339 --> 21:23.522
yelling "Yee-haw."

21:23.599 --> 21:26.025
Yeah, I wouldn't
hold my breath for that.

21:26.101 --> 21:27.618
[Vision] I'm a synthezoid.

21:27.695 --> 21:29.178
I do not actually breathe.

21:29.180 --> 21:31.030
Figure of speech, Vision.

21:31.106 --> 21:39.106
Figure of speech.
