00:01.080 --> 00:06.552
<i>I'm Stacy Goodyear, and joining me on
Wake Up DC is Dr Temperance Brennan.</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:11.236
<i>She's the author of the bestselling
mystery noveI Bred in the Bone,</i>

00:11.320 --> 00:13.550
and she's also - tell
me if I get this wrong -

00:13.640 --> 00:18.111
an anthropologist who works
with the FBI to solve crimes?

00:21.600 --> 00:26.435
Yes, that's correct. I use the bones
of people who have been murdered,

00:26.520 --> 00:28.988
or burned, or...

00:29.080 --> 00:32.436
blown up, or eaten
by animals or insects,

00:32.520 --> 00:34.511
orjust decomposed.

00:35.960 --> 00:42.479
Well, that's exciting. Uh, Dr Brennan,
your book has sold over 300,000 copies.

00:42.560 --> 00:45.154
How do you juggle twin careers

00:45.240 --> 00:48.312
as a bestselling author and
crime-fighting scientist?

00:48.800 --> 00:51.553
I do one, then the other.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.028
And is the work enjoyable? I mean,
the part involving rotten bodies?

01:00.120 --> 01:04.715
Enjoyable? Satisfying,
yes, like cracking a code,

01:04.800 --> 01:10.591
but when you're looking at someone who's
been brutally murdered... It's complicated.

01:10.680 --> 01:13.752
Cos I just thought, you know, yuck!

01:17.520 --> 01:21.672
Doesn't leave you much time
for a personaI life, does it?

01:23.440 --> 01:26.512
It's true I'm more focused
on my career right now.

01:26.600 --> 01:31.276
Most of our viewers are parents, home
with their preschooI-aged children.

01:31.360 --> 01:36.559
What will you tell your kids about
the horrors that you see every day?

01:37.560 --> 01:40.632
I'm not going to have any children.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.314
- Really?
- Yes, really.

01:50.840 --> 01:54.435
Do you have any advice for
budding authors out there?

01:54.520 --> 01:57.876
Well, the first thing they
should have is an idea,

01:57.960 --> 02:02.272
and then, well, first you
need something to write with.

02:02.360 --> 02:06.114
They know that. Well, obviously...

02:06.200 --> 02:10.431
you need a writing instrument
and you need an idea.

02:10.520 --> 02:13.990
I'm just not sure
which should come first.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.118
<i>The book is Bred in the Bone
by Dr Temperance Brennan.</i>

02:19.200 --> 02:22.795
Next up after the break:
wicker, the new leather.

02:22.880 --> 02:26.270
But is it safe for your children?

02:32.720 --> 02:34.199
How was I?

02:34.280 --> 02:37.033
- We'll talk about it on the way.
- On the way where?

02:38.240 --> 02:40.310
<i>Tape off the perimeter.</i>

02:43.280 --> 02:47.592
The fire department came to put out a burning
car. They found a body in the driver's seat.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.717
- The licence plate and VIN are missing.
- Why is the FBI involved?

02:50.800 --> 02:56.716
One burned backpack, child-sized sneaker,
plus the rear seatbelt had been sliced away.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.511
You think it was a kidnapping?

02:59.600 --> 03:03.593
The first 48 hours after a child abduction
are cruciaI. That's why you're here.

03:03.680 --> 03:07.309
You ID that victim, that tells
me what kid I'm looking for.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:41.840 --> 03:46.311
Shoe size four. It's a schoolbag, but the
contents are burned beyond recognition.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.153
What about the human remains?

03:49.240 --> 03:55.395
The victim was female. Her skull shows
combined Caucasoid and Mongoloid features.

03:55.480 --> 04:00.713
Also, preauricular sulcus to the pelvis shows
the victim gave birth five to eight years ago.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.189
The kidnapping victim
could be her child.

04:03.280 --> 04:08.434
Maxillary molars have been replaced
with removable dentures. Lots of gold.

04:08.520 --> 04:11.751
In parts of the Caucasus, when
girls from wealthy families turn 16,

04:11.840 --> 04:15.150
they're given gold teeth
as a display of affluence.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.437
I'll dissolve a bicuspid in nitric
acid and do a chemicaI workup.

04:18.519 --> 04:22.718
- There's something lodged in the larynx.
- Part of her tongue?

04:28.400 --> 04:30.914
It's not fleshy enough.
This is cartilage.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.915
This is Miss Pickering. She's performing
a security review for the State Department.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.117
One man's security review
is another man's witch-hunt.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.873
- That would be Dr Jack Hodgins.
- It would be, yes.

04:41.960 --> 04:46.238
You know us all, don't you, Miss Pickering?
Or is it Agent Pickering from the NSA?

04:46.320 --> 04:49.596
I don't yet know you as
well as I will, Dr Hodgins.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.238
Is something burning?

04:51.320 --> 04:54.630
Not any more. She's pretty
much extinguished by now.

04:54.720 --> 04:59.271
Miss Pickering will require a few minutes
to perform a routine security review.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.353
- I expect everyone to be cooperative.
- I'm not swearing a damn loyalty oath.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.270
And civiI.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.511
Ask Dr Chen in Pathology to
identify this as soon as possible.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.353
- Dr Brennan.
- Yes, security check, civiI.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.989
Zack will grind a segment of the
femur for trace element analysis.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.469
Didn't I see you on
television this morning?

05:16.560 --> 05:21.634
How could I possibly know what you watched
on television? Booth, I have to talk to you.

05:21.720 --> 05:25.679
- Yeah. It was definitely her.
- Maybe work your way up to Dr Brennan.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.877
- Have you ID'd the burn victim?
- I may be jumping the gun...

05:28.960 --> 05:30.075
Music to my ears.

05:30.160 --> 05:34.870
We should be looking at Eastern European
immigrants going back, say, ten years.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.838
I can find that out. Angela
doing the faciaI reconstruction?

05:37.920 --> 05:40.354
- If this works, I'll buy you a puppy.
- Inadvisable.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.637
You never told me how I was this
morning. I asked, "How did I do?"

05:43.720 --> 05:46.188
You said, "We'll talk in
the car," but we didn't.

05:46.280 --> 05:49.033
- Was it your first TV interview?
- Yes.

05:49.120 --> 05:53.796
- It was fine, you know, for your first one.
- Well, that was a qualified response.

05:53.880 --> 05:57.111
What? No. It was lively.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.270
- What kind of word is that?
- An adjective.

05:59.360 --> 06:05.515
<i>Though ironically most words that end
in ly are adverbs, like "ironically".</i>

06:05.600 --> 06:07.989
OK, what did I do wrong?

06:08.080 --> 06:11.868
Maybe next time tell a funny story.
Never say you don't like children.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.520
I didn't say that. I just
said I don't want any.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.909
On TV, it's the same thing.

06:18.200 --> 06:23.991
The victim's skull was in good shape.
No reaI shrinkage from the fire.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.757
I'm running a comparison
between the faciaI reconstruction

06:28.840 --> 06:31.559
and the photos in the
immigration database.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.909
I hear we're gonna get grilled by
some mysterious government chick.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.313
I've been through this before. It's so we can work on classified cases
- CIA, military.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.312
- You have something to hide?
- Better believe it, bucko.

06:45.400 --> 06:48.790
- What kind of something?
- The best kind.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.876
There. That one.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.916
OK.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.632
It's a good match.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.359
Polina Rozalina Semov.

07:04.440 --> 07:08.149
Born 1970, Churdon, Perm
district of the Urals.

07:08.720 --> 07:13.191
She emigrated to the US in '94 with
her sister Maria, married CarI Decker.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.794
- They live in Cleveland Park.
- Children?

07:16.640 --> 07:22.875
Donovan Dimitri Decker, born
1997. He's eight years old.

07:22.960 --> 07:27.317
<i>Polina and Carl separated three
months ago. Separate addresses.</i>

07:27.400 --> 07:30.915
We know that Mom's in a drawer
in your lab. Let's go find Dad.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.958
You arrest someone really small lately?

07:34.040 --> 07:37.271
- Car seat in the back.
- Oh, I had Parker for the weekend.

07:37.360 --> 07:40.193
- How can you do that?
- Install a car seat in an FBI vehicle?

07:40.280 --> 07:42.589
Bring a kid into this
world knowing what you know.

07:42.680 --> 07:47.595
I'll bet Parker was an accident, right?
Because his mother wouldn't marry you? What?

07:47.680 --> 07:50.717
It never occurred to you that
that might be a sensitive topic.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.836
You could have gone
with "very small felon".

07:52.920 --> 07:55.992
I'm better for Parker being
around. Someday you'll see that.

07:56.080 --> 07:57.718
- I won't.
- You'll change your mind.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.518
- I don't do that.
- You will.

07:59.600 --> 08:04.071
Yeah, after I see how CarI Decker reacts when
you tell him his child has been kidnapped.

08:04.160 --> 08:07.914
- We're gonna find Donovan with his dad.
- What? Why?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.639
Most kidnappings happen
by estranged spouses.

08:10.720 --> 08:16.352
You're certainly making the whole
domestic scene more and more attractive.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.592
- This is it?
- Yeah, this is the correct address.

08:19.680 --> 08:23.559
Just hang back and let
me do all the talking. OK?

08:33.840 --> 08:35.876
Mr Decker.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.996
- Bones, what are you doing?
- It's tidy, spartan even.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.275
Is that odd for a
recently separated man?

08:41.360 --> 08:44.830
The guy's supposed to be some
super-rationaI tight-ass geek.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.717
No offence.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.394
There's no TV, no magazines,

08:49.480 --> 08:51.596
no art, no stereo.

08:51.680 --> 08:56.549
There's dust on everything. I don't
think he's been here in a while.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.517
Where are you going?

08:58.600 --> 09:00.750
Booth, where are you going?

09:10.560 --> 09:12.869
- FBI.
- US marshals!

09:12.960 --> 09:13.949
US marshals?

09:14.040 --> 09:17.874
Forensic anthropologist!
That's why no gun.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.678
At least nobody got shot.
Probably cos she didn't have a gun.

09:26.760 --> 09:30.275
Sir, why is CarI Decker's home
being watched by US marshals?

09:30.360 --> 09:33.113
He's a federaI witness
under witness protection.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.351
He's scheduled to appear
before a grand jury in two days.

09:36.440 --> 09:40.718
- Is it a mob thing?
- Decker designs armour for KBC Systems.

09:40.800 --> 09:44.270
He says they knowingly sent
defective armour to Iraq.

09:44.360 --> 09:47.955
The Justice Department believes him
so they moved him to a safe house.

09:48.040 --> 09:51.032
Does the Justice Department
think Decker is in danger?

09:51.120 --> 09:54.157
He thinks he is. They want him
to testify, they play along.

09:54.240 --> 09:57.710
Does Decker know his wife is dead
and his child has been kidnapped?

09:57.800 --> 09:59.756
- No, and they don't want him to.
- Why?

09:59.840 --> 10:04.152
- It might prevent him from testifying.
- Nothing can be gained from him knowing.

10:04.240 --> 10:08.677
Except he doesn't testify and they don't
kill his son. Shouldn't that be his decision?

10:08.760 --> 10:13.959
It's estimated KBC Systems is responsible
for 30 deaths and hundreds of injuries.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.076
It's complicated.

10:16.160 --> 10:19.709
His wife is dead and his child is
missing. That's not so complicated.

10:19.800 --> 10:24.191
- No one's stopping you from investigating.
- He's a witness. I need access to him.

10:24.280 --> 10:27.431
Decker didn't kill his wife
- he was in custody of US marshals,

10:27.520 --> 10:29.795
so start looking someplace else.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.474
Harsh reality, Booth. DeaI with it.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.313
- Does he not like me?
- I don't know.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.392
<i>I'll stay on Polina Decker's remains.</i>

10:41.480 --> 10:45.109
I'll talk to the victims' families
- the ones not under federaI protection.

10:45.200 --> 10:49.079
You think a corporation would actually
kill a woman and kidnap her child?

10:49.160 --> 10:54.234
Billions in dollars, plus civiI suits if they're
found guilty? I've seen people killed for $50.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.232
- You believe the boy is dead?
- I have to assume he isn't.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.639
Why?

10:58.720 --> 11:03.475
It gives me something to look forward to
instead of dread. Given a choice I avoid dread.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.869
- OK. It's logicaI.
- Is it?

11:05.960 --> 11:09.111
Why dread something
that hasn't happened yet?

11:09.200 --> 11:10.394
Yeah.

11:10.720 --> 11:14.952
That piece of cartilage we found in Polina's mouth
- antihelix and meatus remnants.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.315
- It's an ear?
- Chen says it was bitten off.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.709
The victim bit off one
of her attacker's ears.

11:19.800 --> 11:23.315
I heard someone found a
fingertip in their chilli once.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.755
Dr Chen also found vestiges of earwax.

11:25.840 --> 11:29.355
OK, get that wax to Hodgins.
See what he can find.

11:29.440 --> 11:34.798
<i>- How come I have to learn to ride a bike?
- Are you really asking... or just stalling?</i>

11:34.880 --> 11:37.678
<i>- Mm, stalling.
- Y eah. Thought so.</i>

11:40.480 --> 11:43.631
- Why'd you stop?
- What are we hoping to learn from this tape?

11:43.720 --> 11:48.635
We know CarI Decker didn't kidnap his own
child. The mother is dead, and the boy...

11:48.720 --> 11:50.711
And the boy might be dead too.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.792
I'm just wondering, what is
the benefit of watching this?

11:53.880 --> 11:56.314
You put faces to names,
get a sense of people.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.119
You're the anthropologist.
What does this tell you?

11:59.200 --> 12:02.510
Learning to ride a bicycle
is a kind of rite of passage.

12:02.600 --> 12:06.036
- It has anthropologicaI significance.
- Really?

12:06.120 --> 12:11.240
It carries meaning beyond the simple
mechanics of learning to ride a bike.

12:11.320 --> 12:15.279
- Are you being psychologicaI?
- No. Psychology is about the individuaI.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.477
I'm speaking to a set of
culturaI proxies and mores.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.233
What the hell are you talking about?

12:21.680 --> 12:25.673
The father is tight. He's holding
his arms, touching his mouth.

12:25.760 --> 12:30.390
- So he's nervous. So what?
- Look at the boy. He's relaxed. He's not afraid.

12:30.480 --> 12:34.393
- So then why was the boy stalling, huh?
- He's not. The father is.

12:34.480 --> 12:39.110
The son knows that on some leveI and he's
enabling his father to reach a leveI of comfort.

12:39.200 --> 12:43.193
- It's a symbiotic relationship.
- "Relationship. " That's psychology.

12:43.280 --> 12:47.114
The boy trusts his father
absolutely. He's confident.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.873
The father wishes he
didn't have to do this,

12:49.960 --> 12:54.397
but he's accepted that he
must in his role as a father.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.436
<i>What?</i>

12:56.520 --> 12:59.034
Probably felt the same
about being a whistle-blower.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.795
That's psychology, and it's of no
use to us in this investigation.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.598
Just push "play", OK?

13:06.480 --> 13:09.233
<i>- All right, you ready?
- OK.</i>

13:09.320 --> 13:11.754
<i>- Be careful.
- Don't make him nervous, Polina.</i>

13:11.840 --> 13:14.912
<i>Push me, Dad. Let go. Let go.</i>

13:15.000 --> 13:16.399
<i>Not yet.</i>

13:16.480 --> 13:18.277
<i>Let me go, Dad. Let me go.</i>

13:18.360 --> 13:22.069
<i>- Not yet. Run along with him, Carl.
- I can do it.</i>

13:23.880 --> 13:25.871
<i>He's doing it.</i>

13:26.080 --> 13:27.559
<i>He's doing it.</i>

13:27.640 --> 13:30.108
<i>Be careful. Be careful.</i>

13:32.600 --> 13:35.114
<i>How will we get him back, Carl?</i>

13:35.680 --> 13:40.674
That's the reaI question, isn't it,
Bones? How do we get the boy back?

13:41.760 --> 13:48.199
They left this morning very early, about
5am. Donovan is on the swim team. Oh, my God.

13:48.280 --> 13:51.431
- You and your sister were close?
- Yes.

13:51.520 --> 13:57.390
When Polina and CarI separated, she
and Donovan came to stay with me.

13:57.480 --> 13:58.959
This is terrible.

13:59.040 --> 14:02.555
Can you think of anyone who'd
want to hurt your sister?

14:02.640 --> 14:05.074
It must be CarI.

14:05.160 --> 14:08.436
Maybe he was afraid she would
take Donovan away from him.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.353
- Would she have done that?
- No. Never.

14:11.440 --> 14:16.036
- You don't like your brother-in-law.
- He's supposed to be brilliant, I know.

14:16.120 --> 14:20.238
But he is also cold, angry.
Everything has to be just so.

14:20.320 --> 14:25.348
- Why did CarI and your sister separate?
- Polina said he was having an affair.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.159
I thought, "Who'd want him?"

14:28.240 --> 14:33.678
But she found credit card receipts from
a moteI he went to once or twice a week.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.392
When she confronted
CarI, he was furious,

14:37.480 --> 14:40.995
wouldn't talk about it, so she left him.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.154
Please find Donovan.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.151
Find my sister's boy.

14:50.200 --> 14:53.033
I found cracks in the
victim's upper incisors.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.430
There are also bilateraI
fractures in the femoraI necks.

14:56.520 --> 15:00.115
There are similar fractures
in the proximaI humeraI heads.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.270
The body went into spasm as it burned?

15:02.360 --> 15:06.114
If she was burned alive. I'll
have Angela run some scenarios.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.395
Angela's in a security review.

15:08.480 --> 15:12.996
- 25 addresses in six countries in eight years.
- That's weird, right?

15:13.080 --> 15:17.710
- What were you doing in all those places?
- Different things. Mostly looking.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.791
I'm an artist.

15:20.560 --> 15:23.757
- When did you last see your husband?
- My husband?

15:23.840 --> 15:24.955
Yes.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.951
Oh.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.912
Oh.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.115
Wow.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.316
You mean that actually took?

15:32.400 --> 15:35.312
Really, it didn't seem
legaI. We were in Fiji.

15:35.400 --> 15:40.520
There was a fire dance. You know
how those things can be, right?

15:40.600 --> 15:43.637
- I really don't, Ms Montenegro.
- Right.

15:43.720 --> 15:47.269
- And do you like working here?
- Sometimes, yeah.

15:47.360 --> 15:51.239
Not always. But there's also
a sense of accomplishment.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.392
And Brennan needs me, so I feeI
a personaI connection there.

15:54.480 --> 15:59.713
But the world's a big place. Frankly,
I'm emotionally ambivalent on the subject.

16:03.720 --> 16:09.317
Was that the wrong answer? I should be
more "This is the bestjob in the world. "

16:09.400 --> 16:14.679
Right? Am I going too fast here? Am I
treating you too much like a therapist?

16:14.760 --> 16:16.830
Do you want to stop... actually?

16:16.920 --> 16:20.071
Cos... we could pick
this up later if you're...

16:23.400 --> 16:24.389
Yeah.

16:24.480 --> 16:29.508
CarI Decker is not only a
disgruntled employee, he's... uh...

16:29.600 --> 16:31.113
What's the term?

16:31.200 --> 16:36.320
As a lawyer, the legaI term is
"nuts, and a pain in the ass".

16:36.400 --> 16:40.075
"OppositionaI defiance disorder
and paranoia" is what I read.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.515
Like I said, nuts and a pain in the ass.

16:42.600 --> 16:46.070
Read where? Paranoia
- you read that where?

16:48.720 --> 16:50.438
You had CarI Decker investigated?

16:50.520 --> 16:53.432
He's making damaging
allegations against the company.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.033
False allegations.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.475
Who would kill his
wife and kidnap his son?

16:57.560 --> 16:59.516
- It wasn't us.
- I didn't say it was.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.672
Oh, please. We have to
top your list of suspects.

17:02.760 --> 17:07.390
Look, we have an in-house system for dealing
with whistle-blowers. We encourage it.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.993
I served in Vietnam, Agent Booth.

17:10.079 --> 17:12.877
I saw what soldiers see.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.394
If I read you correctly,
you know what I mean.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.914
Army, 75th Regiment.

17:18.839 --> 17:21.991
"Rangers lead the way".

17:22.079 --> 17:27.518
I'd never risk soldiers' lives by knowingly
providing them with defective armour,

17:27.599 --> 17:31.878
and I welcome CarI Decker's appearance
at the grand jury, because he is wrong.

17:31.960 --> 17:36.750
CarI Decker did brilliant work for us,
but he alienated everyone he worked with.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.877
You should look for your
murderer and kidnapper elsewhere.

17:43.680 --> 17:47.355
- Where have you been?
- I'm a field agent. I was out in the field.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.796
There was a piece of an ear in the
victim's mouth, like she bit it off.

17:50.880 --> 17:54.759
- The ear may help us. Did you find anything?
- A lot. No reason for the attitude.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.150
- I beg your pardon?
- It's not like you've been doing all the work.

17:58.240 --> 18:01.471
- What have you found out?
- The victim and her husband had problems.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.472
She found moteI receipts. I
got the moteI's security tapes.

18:04.560 --> 18:09.031
<i>- Angela can use her fat recognition program.
- Mass recognition program.</i>

18:09.120 --> 18:15.355
Whatever. Maybe we'll be able to find out who
Decker was seeing. Is Angela in her office?

18:15.440 --> 18:18.477
The FBI pathologist found no
smoke in the victim's lungs.

18:18.560 --> 18:19.549
Meaning?

18:19.640 --> 18:23.713
The victim was dead when she was burned.
There was clotting in the lungs as well.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.791
- Troublesome.
- If the fire was hot enough...

18:25.880 --> 18:30.590
No. For clotting to occur, superheated
air would have to be drawn into the lungs.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.035
Which wouldn't happen
if she was already dead.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.032
- Something else caused the clotting.
- Angela has the tapes.

18:36.120 --> 18:39.795
The broken teeth could be from
particularly violent seizures.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.154
Epilepsy?

18:41.240 --> 18:44.198
There are severaI causes of
acute tonic muscular contractions.

18:44.280 --> 18:48.273
- Poisoning, drop in blood sugar...
- Is this a good time to speak with Mr Addy?

18:48.360 --> 18:52.478
Considering you had to interrupt him
to ask, probably not. Take Hodgins.

18:52.560 --> 18:55.597
- I demand a lawyer.
- I don't need Dr Hodgins, I need Mr Addy.

18:55.680 --> 18:59.468
- If I demand a lawyer, will I get out of it too?
- We all demand lawyers.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.869
- I'll wait.
- Why aren't you interviewing me?

19:01.960 --> 19:03.632
It won't be necessary.

19:03.720 --> 19:08.032
They think my dossier is complete. They
think they know everything about me.

19:08.120 --> 19:10.634
- They're wrong!
- Be happy they're leaving you alone.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.915
I'm happy. Don't worry, I'm happy.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.232
You know, the ear you found
- there's no way it's her own ear? Right?

19:17.320 --> 19:19.390
- How could it be?
- That's what I'm saying.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.789
- What?
- It's definitely not her ear.

19:21.880 --> 19:25.634
- How could she bite off her own ear?
- Chromosome tests make it a male ear.

19:25.720 --> 19:26.869
Seizures.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.918
Seizures could be due
to low blood sugar,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.072
electrocution, infection, head injury,

19:33.160 --> 19:36.038
brain tumour, a sudden
lack of oxygen in the brain.

19:36.120 --> 19:37.951
- Electrocution.
- What?

19:38.040 --> 19:43.194
The broken teeth, the fractures, the
clots in her lungs. She was electrocuted.

19:43.280 --> 19:47.114
That much damage to the teeth could
only result from multiple violent spasms.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.599
Dozens.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.591
She was tortured.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.551
- For what?
- To find out where her husband was.

19:58.960 --> 20:02.111
- At least pretend to interview me.
- Your file is complete.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.873
No one has interviewed me in two years.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.155
No one has ever interviewed you.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.800
Right. Yeah, let's play it your way.

20:09.880 --> 20:13.270
Your cousin was appointed to a
very high posting in the government.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.749
- My cousin with a bad rug?
- It doesn't affect his job.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.354
It should. It demonstrates
a deniaI of reality.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.716
- Appointed to what very high posting?
- That's classified.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.712
In what part of the government?
Or is that classified too?

20:24.800 --> 20:27.792
As a potentiaI embarrassment,
you were checked out.

20:27.880 --> 20:32.351
- What kind of embarrassment?
- You're a conspiracy buff. You're paranoid.

20:32.440 --> 20:36.797
OK, OK. So you're telling me
that my toe-chewing moron cousin

20:36.880 --> 20:41.237
was appointed to a secret post in a secret
part of the government you can't tell me about,

20:41.320 --> 20:45.552
so you compiled a secret dossier on
me, but I'm the one who's paranoid.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.995
We don't use the word "dossier".

20:48.080 --> 20:51.595
What was the finding?
I still work here, so...

20:51.680 --> 20:54.797
- Harmless.
- "Harmless"? I'm harmless?

20:54.880 --> 20:58.509
Yes. You do not pose a viable threat.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.114
Well, that's just insulting.

21:04.880 --> 21:10.398
If you want me to interview you, I will,
but I'll only discover what we already know.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.232
You are benign.

21:12.320 --> 21:15.835
I am not benign, lady. I'm not harmless.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.718
- I'm malignant. I'm a loaded cannon.
- Thank you.

21:18.800 --> 21:24.397
I know things that would curdle your blood,
including a formula that does curdle blood.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.151
Excuse me.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.708
She's wrong. I'm dangerous.

21:30.840 --> 21:36.278
CarI Decker is 1.7 metres
tall and weighs 58.2 kilograms.

21:36.360 --> 21:41.036
- An ultra-marathoner. - Being
lean should make him easier to find.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.429
- Not him.
- I talked to Pickering.

21:43.520 --> 21:47.354
- Was it awfuI?
- Actually, I found it... cathartic.

21:50.280 --> 21:54.717
- Well, his head's down. What do you think?
- No, he doesn't move like a runner.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.439
She knows a lot about us. It's creepy.

21:57.520 --> 22:00.432
- It's confidentiaI.
- Couldn't you get the file?

22:00.520 --> 22:03.990
- Probably.
- Then it's not confidentiaI.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.668
That's him. That's CarI Decker.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.911
Fast forward
- see if he shows up with anyone else.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.792
Back up.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.909
Freeze on that guy.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.070
Can you zoom in?

22:23.160 --> 22:24.309
<i>Hm.</i>

22:24.400 --> 22:27.472
A secret life can cause maritaI strife.

22:27.560 --> 22:31.633
- He was having an affair with a man?
- For all we know, he's meeting a hit man.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.597
Doesn't look like a hit man.

22:33.680 --> 22:36.797
Print the picture. I'll see if
he's in any of the databases.

22:36.880 --> 22:40.316
- And when we find him?
- HauI him in, check he's got both ears.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.198
I'll let you know what happens.

22:44.880 --> 22:48.429
- Could we start, please?
- Any time. I can do two things at once.

22:48.520 --> 22:51.080
Mr Addy, I require your full attention.

22:51.160 --> 22:53.754
No, you don't. But I'll give it to you.

22:54.720 --> 22:58.872
I need to establish that you are not a
threat to the security of this country.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.111
I have a degree in forensic
anthropology. I study engineering.

23:02.200 --> 23:05.670
Are you afraid I'll build a race of
criminaI robots to destroy the Earth?

23:05.760 --> 23:08.638
- Do you have that kind of fantasy often?
- Very often.

23:08.720 --> 23:12.474
Does it concern you that such thoughts
are a sign of emotionaI retardation?

23:12.560 --> 23:14.790
I've been told. I'm working on it.

23:14.880 --> 23:18.350
- Can you understand why that concerns us?
- Not really.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.750
Hypothetically, you have
a piece of information...

23:21.840 --> 23:26.277
- Secret and meaningfuI information?
- Yes. The security of the country's at stake.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.476
- Could I bribe you to give it to me?
- No.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.357
- Threaten you?
- No.

23:30.440 --> 23:34.274
What if I made a reasonable
rationaI argument, very persuasive?

23:34.360 --> 23:36.396
- Merely persuasive?
- Irrefutable.

23:36.480 --> 23:41.759
I make an irrefutable argument as to why you
should give me this information. Would you?

23:41.840 --> 23:45.913
Not without checking with Dr Brennan
or Angela first, see what they said.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.719
Agent Booth, if he'd talk
to me. He probably wouldn't.

23:48.800 --> 23:51.917
I'd ask Dr Hodgins but he'd say
it was all part of a conspiracy,

23:52.000 --> 23:56.118
so I mostly only take
his advice... on women.

23:56.200 --> 23:59.476
- 480 volts. 350 amps.
- I beg your pardon?

23:59.560 --> 24:03.712
It's sort of secret information
I probably shouldn't tell you.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.075
Any other questions?

24:06.160 --> 24:07.957
Good.

24:15.800 --> 24:19.315
Good work, sir. I only posted his
face on the hot sheet 20 minutes ago.

24:19.400 --> 24:22.472
My boss is the United
States Attorney GeneraI.

24:22.560 --> 24:25.597
You're not doing my career any
good putting me on the hot list.

24:25.680 --> 24:30.196
SpeciaI Agent Seeley Booth, meet
Assistant US Attorney Ken Weeks.

24:31.120 --> 24:35.159
I was hoping you'd turn out to
be gay... or have only one ear.

24:35.240 --> 24:39.756
I get the gay thing a lot because I'm so cute,
but the one-ear thing - that's unique to you.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.274
You're Decker's Justice
Department handler?

24:42.360 --> 24:45.158
CarI Decker was my prime
witness against KBC Systems.

24:45.240 --> 24:48.915
"Was"? Did you get fired cos we caught
you on some moteI surveillance cam?

24:49.000 --> 24:50.319
They lost him.

24:50.400 --> 24:54.757
A materiaI witness for a specially
convened grand jury, and you lost him?

24:54.840 --> 24:59.755
The guy's pretty smart
- genius leveI. Do you have any idea what it's like

24:59.840 --> 25:02.400
- to interact with those types of people?
- A little.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.277
So what made him run?

25:04.360 --> 25:07.158
Decker insisted upon
talking to his son every day.

25:07.240 --> 25:11.711
This morning we couldn't get Donovan. He
panicked and ran. The marshals will find him.

25:11.800 --> 25:15.793
Doesn't matter. He won't testify after
he finds out about his wife and child.

25:15.880 --> 25:19.236
Might as well pack up that grand
jury and send everybody home.

25:19.320 --> 25:24.394
I get the chance, I'll give him the "don't let
your wife die in vain" speech. It might work.

25:24.480 --> 25:28.234
Do you think this company is capable
of putting a hit out on Decker?

25:28.320 --> 25:29.912
Kill his wife, kidnap his kid?

25:30.000 --> 25:33.436
KBC Systems sent our boys into
battle with faulty body armour.

25:33.520 --> 25:37.149
In my book, you can do
that, you can do anything.

25:42.080 --> 25:46.392
- If Decker's smart, how will they catch him?
- Forget Decker. Ourjob is to find his son.

25:46.480 --> 25:50.314
- If Decker doesn't testify...
- We can't assume they'll let the boy live.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.517
- Surely KBC won't...
- We don't know who hired these guys.

25:53.600 --> 25:59.391
KBC, military, disgruntled shareholders,
or someone we haven't even thought of yet.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.390
- What?
- You told me not to jump to a conclusion.

26:02.480 --> 26:05.392
- No offence.
- You were right. It's just I usually tell you.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.710
<i>Our relationship has taken a new turn.</i>

26:07.800 --> 26:10.951
- 480 volts, 350 amps.
- Polina Decker?

26:11.040 --> 26:14.999
The voltage it'd take to cause muscle
spasms so strong they'd fracture bone.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.595
- That's not household current.
- They used a generator.

26:18.680 --> 26:20.796
Zack, you are smart.

26:21.600 --> 26:26.799
Zack! Zack! This guy Decker, he's like
you. He's in the whole stratosphere IQ-wise.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.916
- What's his IQ?
- It's 163.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.309
Oh! He's not where Zack is.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.311
I'm in the ionosphere.

26:33.400 --> 26:36.153
The point is that Decker
escapes the US marshals,

26:36.240 --> 26:38.959
tries to contact his wife and
finds out she's been killed.

26:39.040 --> 26:41.429
- What does he do next?
- His IQ's not a variable.

26:41.520 --> 26:45.274
Intelligence doesn't determine what
you do but how effectively you do it.

26:45.360 --> 26:50.832
- It depends on what kind of person he is.
- Well, you know, he's a loving father,

26:50.920 --> 26:53.992
estranged from the mother of his child.

26:54.520 --> 26:57.796
- Sound like anyone you know?
- Back out of my space, buddy.

26:57.880 --> 27:03.352
Zack's right. If you were in
Decker's position, what would you do?

27:07.560 --> 27:11.712
Bucar four with accessory proceeding
to 4413 Elstree, KBC Systems,

27:11.800 --> 27:14.234
requesting locaI backup, possible 1031.

27:14.320 --> 27:17.357
<i>- Roger that.
- Did you just refer to me as an accessory?</i>

27:17.440 --> 27:21.399
You asked me what I'd do if I were Decker.
They kill my wife, they take my boy,

27:21.480 --> 27:24.199
I go to the source of the
problem. I take 'em out.

27:24.280 --> 27:26.430
Take 'em out like...?

27:28.520 --> 27:29.873
Oh.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.631
- FBI. Seward in?
- Yes, sir.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.711
Secure the building. Nobody in or out.

27:34.800 --> 27:39.828
I enjoy your company, but at times like this
you give me something extra to worry about.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.798
You enjoy my company?

27:55.800 --> 27:58.553
<i>- Make the call.
- FBI, Mr Decker.</i>

27:58.640 --> 28:00.949
Drop your weapon. Now!

28:02.000 --> 28:06.152
Nothing's changed. Make the
call, or I'll blow your head off.

28:06.240 --> 28:10.552
- He wants me to call his son's kidnappers.
- Tell them to release my boy or you die.

28:10.640 --> 28:12.551
It's that simple.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.995
- You can shoot me after that.
- I don't know...

28:15.080 --> 28:19.631
- Mr Decker, Agent Booth is an excellent shot.
- I'm not afraid to die.

28:19.720 --> 28:22.871
- For God's sake, shoot him.
- Mr Seward, please shut up.

28:22.960 --> 28:27.636
What you're trying to do, save your son,
that's not gonna happen if you die here tonight.

28:27.720 --> 28:32.919
Be rationaI, Mr Decker. What you were
planning has failed. You have to adapt.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.471
Adapt how?

28:43.480 --> 28:46.916
AII I want is for my son to live.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.470
You people just took
away his best chance.

28:59.120 --> 29:02.396
<i>- Do you know a Lily Marsden?
- Yes, I do.</i>

29:02.480 --> 29:05.597
- Have you had sex with her?
- This falls under your purview?

29:05.680 --> 29:10.196
- Lily Marsden is an environmentaI extremist.
- She's in Earth Now.

29:10.280 --> 29:12.475
You give money to Earth Now, don't you?

29:12.560 --> 29:16.917
And the Sierra Club and Habitat for
Humanity, the opera, and public radio.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.835
Lily Marsden has been arrested for
breaking into animaI labs, torching SUVs,

29:21.920 --> 29:27.711
trespassing on military reserves, dousing
citizens wearing fur with red paint...

29:27.800 --> 29:32.396
Dr Goodman, if you have had or are
having sexuaI relations with Lily Marsden,

29:32.480 --> 29:34.311
- we have a problem.
- Why?

29:34.400 --> 29:38.154
Because an illicit sexuaI relationship
gives her leverage over you.

29:38.240 --> 29:41.198
This makes you a security risk.

29:42.520 --> 29:46.479
I'm a married man, Ms Pickering.
I'm faithfuI to my wife.

29:46.560 --> 29:49.438
Please define your
relationship with Lily Marsden.

29:49.520 --> 29:52.080
I enjoy talking to her.

29:52.160 --> 29:55.277
We argue. She's a nut,
but she's a smart nut.

29:55.360 --> 29:59.558
She's... always interesting.
She's never dull.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.790
- So you...
- Talk to her.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.320
It's a bad sign when
discourse becomes suspect.

30:06.400 --> 30:09.233
- You talk to her?
- Sometimes we yell.

30:10.560 --> 30:14.917
You want to give me one good reason why I
shouldn't charge you with attempted murder?

30:15.000 --> 30:18.390
- You think I went after him out of vengeance?
- Looks like that.

30:18.480 --> 30:24.430
KBC Systems hired people to kill my wife and
kidnap my child. Think rationally for a minute.

30:24.520 --> 30:29.958
If KBC Systems is behind the kidnapping,
Seward would be the person to call it off.

30:30.040 --> 30:32.998
A rationaI human. How did you
find yourself amongst these people?

30:33.080 --> 30:34.559
We are trying to help.

30:34.640 --> 30:39.156
Excellent. Hold your gun to Trent Seward's
head and force him to let my son go.

30:39.240 --> 30:43.950
There's no compelling evidence that Trent
Seward ordered the kidnapping of your son.

30:44.040 --> 30:49.398
I personally calculated the penetration
tolerances for the combat flakjackets.

30:49.480 --> 30:53.439
The company found my calculations
to be excessively conservative.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.273
30 soldiers died.

30:56.360 --> 31:01.036
Trent Seward will do anything
to prevent me from testifying.

31:01.120 --> 31:05.079
He or someone working for him
kidnapped my child and killed my wife.

31:05.160 --> 31:08.550
If you want to get Trent Seward,
tell that grand jury what you know.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.949
And the kidnappers will kill my boy.

31:11.040 --> 31:16.194
With respect for what you're going through
emotionally, sir, Mr Weeks is not wrong.

31:16.280 --> 31:21.877
This is my son. I love him, and if there's
even a slight chance that I can save his life

31:21.960 --> 31:25.191
by shutting up, then that's
what I'll do. Shut the hell up!

31:25.280 --> 31:27.430
And what about the soldiers?

31:27.520 --> 31:33.311
Analytically, I understand that
many lives outweigh the one...

31:33.400 --> 31:36.153
but I cannot trade my son's life.

31:36.240 --> 31:39.437
Have you considered that your
wife will have died in vain?

31:39.520 --> 31:45.038
Shut up. If you had protected Mr Decker and
his family properly, we wouldn't even be here.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.709
Let's go.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.595
The only way that I will testify...

31:59.040 --> 32:01.679
is if I see you with my son.

32:01.760 --> 32:05.514
Mr Decker, you and Donovan,
you have a codeword?

32:05.600 --> 32:08.831
Something to let him
know that you sent me?

32:11.760 --> 32:14.354
"Paladin".

32:14.440 --> 32:17.477
Tell Donovan "paladin".

32:19.200 --> 32:20.952
Paladin.

32:21.040 --> 32:24.350
Defender of the faith, protector.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.351
Suits you, Booth.

32:27.880 --> 32:32.670
You know what? You tough
guys are all very sentimentaI.

32:37.800 --> 32:43.113
I have results on the earwax. I ran the
particulates through the gas chromatograph

32:43.200 --> 32:47.159
<i>and found the pollen of Eragrostis
curvula, known as weeping lovegrass.</i>

32:47.240 --> 32:50.630
- Where does one find weeping love?
- That's found worldwide.

32:50.720 --> 32:54.998
But weeping lovegrass?
That's in South Africa.

32:55.080 --> 32:57.036
Anything else?

32:57.120 --> 33:02.148
Traces of automotive-grade asbestos. The
guy didn't have very good auraI hygiene.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.435
Dr Brennan.

33:04.520 --> 33:08.115
- What, now? You've got to be kidding.
- Take me. I'll waive the lawyer.

33:08.200 --> 33:11.988
I have a few surprises in me. Tell
that to your superiors at the NSA.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.799
Booth, we're looking for
a one-eared South African.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.791
- South African?
- Does that mean something?

33:16.880 --> 33:19.678
There's a number of South
African security consultants

33:19.760 --> 33:23.958
companies use to do their dirty work in
the Third World. They're really mercenaries.

33:24.560 --> 33:26.949
<i>- He might be a mechanic.
- You can tell that?</i>

33:27.040 --> 33:29.793
<i>He had traces of what is
probably brake pad in his ear.</i>

33:29.880 --> 33:32.189
<i>- How'd that get in there?
- Any number of ways.</i>

33:32.280 --> 33:37.798
<i>Most likely his hand comes in contact with
asbestos and then he scratches his ear.</i>

33:42.200 --> 33:44.589
<i>Hello? Are you still there?</i>

33:45.920 --> 33:47.990
- I'm on my way over.
- What's the matter?

33:48.080 --> 33:49.877
Somebody sent me
Donovan Decker's finger.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.836
An eight-year-old boy? That's
consistent with what I'm looking at.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.150
You should send this
to an FBI pathologist.

33:59.240 --> 34:03.995
They'd give me fingerprints and DNA. We
know who the finger belongs to. I need more.

34:04.080 --> 34:05.149
Like what?

34:05.240 --> 34:08.437
You gave me a South African
mechanic from a chunk of burned ear.

34:08.520 --> 34:11.193
Do it again. Do it better. Do it fast.

34:11.280 --> 34:12.429
What?

34:12.520 --> 34:15.114
Start. Come on, do what you do.

34:15.199 --> 34:17.509
- You're kind of worked up.
- You see facts

34:17.600 --> 34:23.914
but I see a terrified little boy with his
finger cut off. Now, is he even still alive?

34:24.000 --> 34:29.074
Blood saturation levels are high. His heart
was beating when they removed his finger.

34:29.159 --> 34:30.752
OK.

34:31.760 --> 34:34.194
- He's alive. That's something.
- Who does this?

34:34.280 --> 34:36.475
Cuts a finger off an
eight-year-old boy?

34:36.560 --> 34:39.632
Mercenaries, professionals.
They don't feeI a thing.

34:39.719 --> 34:42.553
- I feeI things, Booth.
- Never said you didn't, Bones.

34:42.639 --> 34:44.790
I'm a professionaI too.

34:44.880 --> 34:49.715
I do better work if I only see the finger and
not the child. That doesn't mean I'm like them.

34:49.800 --> 34:54.351
I know that, but what I also know is that
they made a big mistake sending us that finger.

34:54.440 --> 34:58.035
- Because it made you mad?
- Because you're gonna use it to catch them.

34:58.120 --> 35:00.918
So, you gather up your squint squad.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.275
Let's get to work.

35:03.360 --> 35:06.750
Did you kick the ball?
How far did it go?

35:06.840 --> 35:10.879
<i>Backwards? Yeah, I can kick a ball.</i>

35:10.960 --> 35:14.270
I'm gonna... Daddy's
gonna show you on Saturday.

35:14.360 --> 35:16.749
I'm gonna see you Saturday, OK, Parker?

35:16.840 --> 35:20.913
OK, I gotta go, bub. I love you. I'll
see you Saturday. Bye. What have you got?

35:21.000 --> 35:24.356
The finger was severed using
a hatchet on a wooden surface.

35:24.440 --> 35:26.795
- Cutting board?
- No. Older, unsealed pine.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.440
- I'm thinking a mechanic's workbench.
- Why?

35:29.520 --> 35:32.671
Traces of lead and methyI
tertiary-butyI ether on the bone.

35:32.760 --> 35:36.799
- The naiI was bitten to the quick.
- The kid was nervous. You would be too.

35:36.880 --> 35:40.953
- MTBEs have been in gas since the '70s.
- But there's lead here as well.

35:41.040 --> 35:44.749
Leaded gasoline was phased
out between 1975 and 1986.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.991
Asbestos from brake pads, leaded
gasoline, a mechanic bench,

35:48.080 --> 35:52.312
plus the mother was electrocuted
by current from a generator.

35:52.400 --> 35:56.598
We want an abandoned gas station or a
mechanic shop off the grid. You're geniuses.

35:56.680 --> 35:59.433
- How do we find that?
- I work for the FBI, you idiot.

35:59.520 --> 36:04.992
Way to go, Zack. We went from
geniuses to idiots in three seconds.

36:05.320 --> 36:08.198
- Tell me what you were doing in Cuba.
- Only if you tell me first.

36:08.280 --> 36:11.352
- I beg your pardon?
- I don't know your security clearance.

36:11.440 --> 36:15.035
<i>- What is your security clearance?
- Check with the State Department.</i>

36:15.120 --> 36:19.398
- I'm from the State Department.
- Then that should make it easy for you.

36:19.480 --> 36:25.237
When you were in Cuba, did you meet
with a man... named Juan Guzman?

36:38.800 --> 36:42.509
Hello. It's Dr Brennan
from the Jeffersonian.

36:42.600 --> 36:46.388
You told me to call you if
anyone asked about... you know...

36:46.480 --> 36:48.277
him.

36:49.200 --> 36:53.591
Someone from the State Department
named Samantha Pickering.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.597
Pickering.

37:02.040 --> 37:05.510
Yes, sir. Yes, I'll wait here.

37:10.640 --> 37:13.632
- Any more questions?
- No.

37:13.720 --> 37:17.508
Uh, no. In fact, the
entire review is suspended.

37:19.760 --> 37:23.389
I'm to wait here untiI someone
comes to destroy my notes.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.869
We might have the kid.

37:30.280 --> 37:34.558
Polina didn't make any cellphone calls after
she was kidnapped, but nobody turned it off.

37:34.640 --> 37:39.236
When she left her coverage area, the
phone was assigned a new routeing tower.

37:39.320 --> 37:42.392
- You could triangulate her position.
- To within 75 square miles.

37:42.480 --> 37:46.996
There were six abandoned gas stations in that area
- five urban, one ruraI.

37:47.080 --> 37:49.753
SWAT'll check them all, but
I think it's the ruraI one.

37:49.840 --> 37:52.354
- Why?
- Cos I used to do this kind of work.

37:52.440 --> 37:56.513
- Rescuing people?
- Or being the person to be rescued from.

37:56.600 --> 37:57.589
Oh.

37:57.680 --> 38:03.038
If I had a choice, I picked an isolated
area. This is an abandoned truck repair depot.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.873
- SWAT will meet us there.
- Why don't we ever take my car?

38:05.960 --> 38:07.712
- Do you have bulletproof vests?
- No.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.233
That's why.

38:19.720 --> 38:23.030
The FLIR imagery gives us three
adults within the structure.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.599
- Boy?
- No reading.

38:24.680 --> 38:29.549
- Probably because he's small, hypothermic.
- Entirely possible, sir. What's the play?

38:29.640 --> 38:32.473
I go in first, straight for
the kid. You do what you do.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.788
All right.

38:33.880 --> 38:36.030
- What about me?
- Wait outside.

38:36.120 --> 38:40.113
- I don't want to miss anything.
- These guys aren't like anyone you've met.

38:40.200 --> 38:46.196
Please, just be someone you aren't for the
next ten minutes and you hang back. Please.

39:16.560 --> 39:19.199
<i>Ten o'clock!</i>

39:20.560 --> 39:22.471
<i>Get down!</i>

39:35.400 --> 39:38.233
- Donovan, don't look at him any more. OK?
- No!

39:38.320 --> 39:42.711
- Don't look at him any more. It's all right.
- No! No! Get away! Get off! Get away!

39:42.800 --> 39:45.678
Donovan... paladin. OK?

39:45.760 --> 39:48.672
Paladin. Paladin.

39:48.760 --> 39:51.832
OK? Paladin. Come on. Come on.

39:59.680 --> 40:02.319
All right. You OK? You good?

40:03.320 --> 40:05.311
It's all right. It's all right.

40:34.480 --> 40:36.391
Is my dad crying?

40:36.480 --> 40:40.917
I think your dad's crying because
he's happy. He's happy he got you back.

40:50.040 --> 40:53.112
- Well done.
- I hope you're really good at yourjob.

40:53.200 --> 40:56.590
