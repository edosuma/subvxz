00:18.530 --> 00:21.408
INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

00:32.877 --> 00:37.256
As a kid, I believed in miracles and the miraculous.

00:37.340 --> 00:40.051
But when I got older, faded my conviction.

00:40.134 --> 00:43.888
Water into wine became maja on a Saturday night.

00:43.971 --> 00:49.309
And if I had seen a burning bush, I had downloaded water hose.

00:50.811 --> 00:54.773
But even at that time I had my love for horses -

00:54.856 --> 00:57.526
- And a burning passion for riding.

00:57.609 --> 01:01.029
It kept my heart open to miracles.

01:01.112 --> 01:04.991
That one day I would hear it.

01:05.074 --> 01:09.287
Just as sweet as the wine at Cana. Just as bright as the burning bush.

01:09.370 --> 01:12.039
Lord's voice.

01:12.123 --> 01:15.835
And like a child again ... I would regain my faith.

01:49.575 --> 01:53.454
- I'm late! - You are not early either.

01:53.662 --> 01:57.124
And the manager would prefer that we come in early.

02:42.376 --> 02:47.255
- Move over, your cow. - It costs more than your parents' house.

02:47.380 --> 02:52.135
It probably costs more than three houses.

02:55.722 --> 02:58.891
Come again.

03:01.769 --> 03:03.604
Good boy.

03:13.989 --> 03:17.075
Okay. I've seen enough.

03:17.159 --> 03:18.744
Return the boom.

03:21.538 --> 03:26.543
- What do you think? - He's a tough guy. A little front-heavy.

03:27.210 --> 03:33.883
- If someone could shorten his steps ... - Now is the extra one expert.

03:33.967 --> 03:38.054
I try me on the doubles again. Of course, with shorter steps.

03:38.721 --> 03:40.348
FA igen.

03:44.768 --> 03:48.772
- I recognize you. - I doubt that.

03:48.856 --> 03:55.654
Yes I do. - Is not that the girl from Virginia Junior Championship?

03:55.737 --> 03:59.407
The girl who looked like the Michelin old man?

03:59.491 --> 04:03.703
You remember her ridiculous outfit?

04:03.787 --> 04:07.290
We laughed so hard that we almost fell out of our saddles.

04:08.666 --> 04:13.713
You know what I remember? I beat a lot of rich kids.

04:13.796 --> 04:19.677
But the funny thing is that I do not remember you.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.428
Ferment...

04:39.779 --> 04:43.741
If I decided I would fire you because you smoke at the stables.

04:46.911 --> 04:49.956
"Safety first". That's my motto.

04:53.125 --> 04:56.837
Are you some kind Ken doll?

04:56.921 --> 05:02.009
- Would imagine a compliment? - Just above the waist.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.804
Nothing?

05:07.264 --> 05:11.184
Nevermind. You are a bore.

05:14.187 --> 05:19.109
So will your boss to buy Peaches?

05:19.192 --> 05:22.904
Probably. The family Dumar has shown some interest.

05:22.987 --> 05:27.533
They will probably push up the price in the bidding against Bonnie.

05:27.617 --> 05:30.244
Bonnie? Is she your boss?

05:30.328 --> 05:35.416
My partner. Bonnie Brae, which owns Brae Valley Farms?

05:35.499 --> 05:38.210
It is not far from my home.

05:38.294 --> 05:43.298
Bonnie looking for a new stallion and your boy look promising.

05:43.382 --> 05:48.303
By the way, did you know who I was when you questioned my ability?

05:50.347 --> 05:53.808
Sorry, I'm not talking eye rolling.

05:55.351 --> 05:57.729
Excuse me.

05:57.812 --> 06:01.816
Fish for compliments? It is quite ridiculous.

06:01.899 --> 06:07.697
You know very well that everyone in the industry know who Jonathan Collier.

06:07.780 --> 06:11.200
But you are not a part of the industry, right?

06:11.283 --> 06:17.081
- You are a stole lapa, a suede square brownie. - I'm a rider.

06:17.164 --> 06:21.043
No. You were a rider when you won the Virginia Junior Championship.

06:21.126 --> 06:27.174
It was over four years ago, according to the always charming Miss Dumar -

06:27.257 --> 06:31.720
- Who really do not like you, and please tell it to others.

06:31.803 --> 06:34.222
Nowadays...

06:35.723 --> 06:39.477
... Shoveling manure and you smoke when you are alone on the job.

06:39.560 --> 06:43.981
What funny. Is that what you think about me?

06:44.065 --> 06:49.528
Do you think some grass led to my deposition?

06:49.778 --> 06:55.784
They called me the Man from my riding clothes were too big.

06:56.034 --> 06:59.830
My parents could not afford new clothes every time I grew.

06:59.913 --> 07:04.960
So my mom bought larger sizes I had to grow into.

07:05.043 --> 07:10.256
Elysse Dumar and her friends thought it was funny, so I beat them.

07:10.340 --> 07:17.138
Okay? I do not ride anymore because I can not afford to pay for the horse.

07:17.221 --> 07:21.517
I'm not Elysse Dumar who receive money if she puckers her lips.

07:21.600 --> 07:26.355
My father's salary goes to huslÃ¥net, groceries and tires to the car.

07:26.438 --> 07:29.817
- Am I boring you? - A little, yes.

07:29.900 --> 07:33.820
If you had wanted to ride, you had found a solution.

07:33.904 --> 07:39.534
Instead shoveling manure to smoke on, and blame everything on your surroundings.

07:40.952 --> 07:42.704
What do you know about it?

07:42.954 --> 07:45.415
I know there are horses that you can buy.

07:45.498 --> 07:49.586
Not like this guy. Not horses for one hundred thousand US dollars.

07:49.711 --> 07:54.048
Horses who are poorly trained or even abused.

07:54.132 --> 07:58.678
Horses that cost a few thousand dollars and can be trained to racing form.

07:58.761 --> 08:04.016
But you have to stop tune your situation first.

08:04.099 --> 08:09.563
Do you understand what I'm saying? You need to stop wallowing in your misery -

08:09.646 --> 08:11.898
- And really search for them.

08:12.149 --> 08:16.111
Of course, it is provided that you have saved salary.

08:17.737 --> 08:20.281
Should I interpret that as a no?

08:50.394 --> 08:52.562
63 lousy bucks.

09:08.202 --> 09:10.663
Debi! Stay!

09:12.915 --> 09:15.876
- They want to meet you at the equestrian course. - What?

09:15.960 --> 09:21.965
After yesterday, I would worry more for the "why" than the "what"?

09:22.049 --> 09:24.635
Come on! Hurry up!

09:24.760 --> 09:29.306
- Are you sure about this, Jonathan? - I need to see what he is capable of.

09:29.389 --> 09:33.476
But Jonathan, we have the most skilled riders.

09:33.560 --> 09:37.063
The girl can ride. - You said she could ride.

09:37.147 --> 09:41.359
Four years ago, on a horse that approached the tomb.

09:41.442 --> 09:46.280
And yet she defeated you. I want to see what she can do with a real horse.

09:48.157 --> 09:50.785
You wanted to see me, Mr Blue.

09:50.868 --> 09:54.538
- That's right ... excuse? - Debi.

09:54.622 --> 10:00.377
Of course, Debi. Mr Collier wanted to ask if we could ...

10:00.627 --> 10:04.464
One can learn a lot from watching someone else ride.

10:06.133 --> 10:10.428
I wish you could consider using one of our riders.

10:10.512 --> 10:13.097
He does not inspire confidence directly.

10:15.808 --> 10:20.021
You may be right, Monty. We should get a real horseman.

10:20.104 --> 10:24.734
I can handle it. I said, "I can handle it."

10:26.068 --> 10:27.778
Ferment? Are you sure?

10:29.363 --> 10:31.031
Okay.

10:33.951 --> 10:37.537
It is best not to take any risks, in spite of your thick skull.

10:39.331 --> 10:41.958
Need help, Debi?

10:45.128 --> 10:48.256
Is there a head under a helmet?

10:50.341 --> 10:52.176
Get up!

10:54.971 --> 10:57.431
This should be good.

11:22.998 --> 11:26.334
Pilar, did you know that the girl was so proficient?

11:26.417 --> 11:30.004
I did not even know that she worked for us before yesterday.

11:37.845 --> 11:40.806
It's a shame that she could not compete.

11:40.931 --> 11:46.311
Jumping is not for the mob. Therefore invented roller derby.

11:46.395 --> 11:48.355
She is the reason why ...

11:58.448 --> 12:02.035
Monty, how about $ 40,000?

12:03.161 --> 12:05.788
I will return.

12:05.872 --> 12:09.542
40,000 sounds like a fair offer.

12:09.625 --> 12:12.670
Next time I'll bring my own helmet.

12:14.171 --> 12:18.175
I knew someone would discover how cruel you are -

12:18.259 --> 12:21.887
- And buy yourself while breaking my heart.

12:21.970 --> 12:27.017
You're a real sweetie who let them do it.

12:29.102 --> 12:34.274
It is foolish to waste your talent because you're pissed off at the world.

12:34.357 --> 12:37.485
"My dad can not afford my dream horse."

12:37.569 --> 12:40.363
"The other girls are mean."

12:41.948 --> 12:43.908
What?

12:43.992 --> 12:47.703
You love the particular sound of your own voice.

12:49.121 --> 12:53.209
- Do you do anything other than talk? - I assure you ...

12:53.292 --> 12:56.337
Make sure not care about anything, Ken.

12:56.420 --> 13:01.717
Help me be better if you are so convinced of my talent.

13:01.800 --> 13:07.222
Help me. Train me if I can find a horse.

13:07.305 --> 13:11.518
Everyone knows that you are the chief of finding rider's hidden talents.

13:11.601 --> 13:15.688
So help me find my hidden talents.

13:15.772 --> 13:22.445
That said: You love the sound of your voice, but has no substance.

13:22.528 --> 13:26.824
Do you know how much I take to train a rider?

13:27.116 --> 13:30.244
How would you be able to afford my services?

13:30.327 --> 13:34.039
I'm good at what I do, but I does not conduct charity.

13:34.123 --> 13:37.584
I want to get paid for the effort.

13:37.668 --> 13:43.215
Okay sure. I can work on your farm. Whatever ...

13:43.298 --> 13:47.385
Stop messing around. A lifetime mockande is not enough for my fees.

14:00.857 --> 14:02.483
Okay.

14:04.568 --> 14:07.279
- What do you mean "okay"? - Okay then.

14:09.532 --> 14:14.078
- Are you serious? - Seriously.

14:14.161 --> 14:17.289
We'll see if you can handle it.

14:27.298 --> 14:31.469
He's not wrong. Many fine horses sold away.

14:31.719 --> 14:34.555
Horses with fine pedigrees.

14:34.806 --> 14:39.810
Just rotten, miserable owners who should never have been allowed to approach a horse.

14:40.061 --> 14:43.606
- Broken down horses. - In need of salvation.

14:43.689 --> 14:48.068
- As we all are. - Do not start that again.

14:48.152 --> 14:53.949
Maybe I need to be saved. I ran and I hid myself.

14:54.074 --> 14:58.120
It was difficult and I had to tough for me.

14:58.203 --> 15:02.332
We can check the horse market. I can help you in the right direction.

15:02.415 --> 15:05.877
I do not need your help. I can choose my own horse.

15:06.169 --> 15:11.007
I know exactly what I'm after. An independent talent.

15:11.090 --> 15:15.553
- Really? Was that all? - And a lion's heart.

15:16.929 --> 15:23.185
Do you think it's funny? He's out there and I'll find him.

15:23.269 --> 15:26.021
I just hope he does not cost more than 63 dollars.

16:24.660 --> 16:30.207
Come back here, you bastard, otherwise you'll see!

16:30.291 --> 16:33.377
Come back here!

16:35.254 --> 16:37.965
Your hell horse! I'm going to notice you!

16:39.550 --> 16:44.930
And if I had seen a burning bush, I had downloaded water hose.

17:24.760 --> 17:30.515
Then I heard it. Sweet as the wine at Cana, bright as the burning bush.

17:31.766 --> 17:37.480
The miracle of the Lord's voice. And like a child, I thought again.

17:40.733 --> 17:42.610
Come back here!

17:44.612 --> 17:47.698
Your freaking hell horse!

17:47.781 --> 17:52.536
I would shoot you if it were not a waste of bullets.

17:52.619 --> 17:56.331
Is this your horse? Is he for sale?

17:56.415 --> 18:02.546
He was there, but I received no bids. And after this teaches not enter.

18:02.629 --> 18:07.967
It would be a shame to have to sell him to the butcher.

18:08.051 --> 18:11.429
- You can not do it. - Why not, honey?

18:11.679 --> 18:15.349
- You just do not get it. - Do you have anything to say?

18:15.433 --> 18:21.439
Let's go. I know you hear what I say.

18:27.027 --> 18:31.031
- Why would the Lord speak to me? - Why not?

18:31.115 --> 18:34.076
Was not as "priestly".

18:35.369 --> 18:41.124
I heard it loud and clear, so I must have been crazy.

18:41.207 --> 18:45.086
Can I have had a brain tumor like in the movies?

18:45.170 --> 18:49.882
I would rather believe that the Lord spoke to me than that I had a tumor.

18:49.966 --> 18:55.721
Why do you think the Lord asked you to buy this horse?

18:55.805 --> 19:00.267
Or any horse at all? The Lord may have a purpose for you.

19:00.351 --> 19:04.188
- I'm not an evangelist, Father. - Maybe not.

19:04.313 --> 19:09.526
But this horse maybe it is. Are you going to buy him?

19:09.610 --> 19:14.698
At the moment I miss about half of the money.

19:14.781 --> 19:18.785
And it is with the help of my friend Tommy and an attendant that I know.

19:18.868 --> 19:23.873
So I hope that the Lord has a plan for me no fucking ...

19:23.957 --> 19:29.545
- ... Damn plane. - Let me see if I understand everything.

19:29.629 --> 19:35.801
The Lord gave you the opportunity to ride. He gave you the strength to jump.

19:35.885 --> 19:39.972
He gave you the insight to find a very special horse.

19:40.055 --> 19:44.726
And now I hope you are in a magical way to pay for it too?

19:44.810 --> 19:49.940
I was hoping you could pray with me and ask the Lord if he could ...

19:50.023 --> 19:52.818
- No. - No?

19:52.901 --> 19:55.236
It is your prayer, Miss Debi.

19:55.362 --> 20:00.575
But before you ask for more you should show gratitude for what you already got.

20:00.658 --> 20:06.038
You do not need a miracle to achieve your goals. You are the miracle.

20:06.122 --> 20:12.378
All you have to do is put you in the saddle and start riding again.

20:32.772 --> 20:37.777
It was not the first time that I asked. But it was the first time in years.

20:37.860 --> 20:43.491
First time since I moved from Nutbush, Virginia.

20:57.546 --> 20:59.715
- Debi? - Hi!

20:59.798 --> 21:05.178
- Debi, little girl! - Hi mom. I've missed you!

21:05.262 --> 21:09.057
Hey! I've missed you!

21:09.140 --> 21:14.729
- Will you finally move home? - Stop it, you know it will not happen.

21:18.483 --> 21:21.485
Let's see if I understand.

21:21.569 --> 21:26.073
Lord asked you to go home and fix money from your mom ... -

21:26.157 --> 21:31.537
- ... To buy an old nag? - He's not a nag.

21:34.498 --> 21:37.876
- Can you paint over there? - Sure.

21:39.336 --> 21:42.339
- Love you. - I love you too.

21:44.716 --> 21:47.886
I understand there is a lot to take in.

21:47.969 --> 21:53.558
But the Lord gave me my skills and a mission to complete.

21:53.766 --> 21:56.352
And the horse? Two years, Debi.

21:56.435 --> 22:01.190
You have wasted two years of your life by shoveling shit for rich people.

22:01.273 --> 22:07.363
I thought that maybe you made something and was ready to study further.

22:07.446 --> 22:13.827
That you were ready to find a job, to earn your livelihood.

22:13.911 --> 22:18.290
Do you think it's easy for me to come here and ask for help?

22:25.672 --> 22:30.301
- I know the Lord ... - The Lord wants you to do what?

22:30.385 --> 22:35.681
Savior all rich girls who have always looked down on you?

22:35.765 --> 22:40.478
Or preaching to all illiterate who work in the stables -

22:40.728 --> 22:46.442
- And do not have other thoughts than how to get you in bed.

22:48.318 --> 22:51.530
I do not know what the Lord wants of me.

22:51.613 --> 22:57.702
I just know that he wants me to do it through my jumping.

22:58.662 --> 23:02.332
And you think this horse is necessary?

23:02.624 --> 23:05.501
Do not encourage her, Margaret.

23:05.752 --> 23:10.548
I do. I have already saved up booklets.

23:10.631 --> 23:16.470
Tommy helped me and even Pastor Brewer gave me $ 100!

23:16.595 --> 23:21.767
- Larry, if a pastor ... - I do not care what the country bumpkin think!

23:31.526 --> 23:37.240
I'm not the villain here. I know what it can do against a -

23:37.323 --> 23:41.619
- When trying to get into a world that does not want one.

23:41.703 --> 23:47.917
How do you think I felt when the Redskins finished my contract?

23:48.000 --> 23:52.880
How difficult do you think it was to return and train school football?

23:52.963 --> 23:56.258
From the top back to school!

23:59.344 --> 24:03.265
Debi, darling, you're my little girl. I love you more than ...

24:05.350 --> 24:07.894
But you're too stubborn!

24:07.978 --> 24:14.943
It hurts to see you throw yourself against the wall until nothing is left.

24:16.319 --> 24:21.324
So you think it's better not to try to achieve their dreams?

24:21.407 --> 24:24.327
How is it better for me?

24:27.830 --> 24:30.416
This is how it is:

24:30.499 --> 24:34.753
Two years ago, you went away when I told -

24:34.837 --> 24:38.799
- That we could not afford to buy a Sunday horse for $ 100,000.

24:38.882 --> 24:43.804
But your mother and I have put money aside for two years at the university.

24:43.887 --> 24:47.933
So when you are ready to take your head out of your ...

24:50.435 --> 24:54.772
... Out of the clouds and start thinking about your future -

24:54.856 --> 25:01.153
- Waiting for the money to you. Until then, this conversation is over.

25:14.416 --> 25:17.711
He will never change, right?

25:17.794 --> 25:20.589
Do you think the Lord has plans for Debi?

25:20.714 --> 25:25.135
I believe the Lord has plans for all of us.

25:25.218 --> 25:29.264
But not everyone can be the occasion.

26:16.976 --> 26:20.354
I'm not the same girl anymore.

26:20.437 --> 26:24.400
The girl he sees when he looks at me. I'm not her anymore.

26:25.943 --> 26:29.780
I have changed. If it were not for this horse -

26:29.863 --> 26:35.452
- I would still save to buy a horse.

26:35.535 --> 26:40.040
I'm trying to say that I was meant to be with this horse.

26:44.711 --> 26:49.590
- Can you say something? - I would like to see this horse.

27:12.946 --> 27:17.242
Are you back? The price is the same as the last three times.

27:18.785 --> 27:22.205
You bring a school principal here changes nothing.

27:22.288 --> 27:26.834
It's my mother, Bobby. She wanted to meet The Evangelist.

27:26.918 --> 27:30.880
Call him Princess if you want, but you still have to pay first.

27:30.963 --> 27:34.258
Before that, he named Hell's horse.

27:34.341 --> 27:37.636
So you have money with you?

27:37.928 --> 27:43.183
Otherwise it adjÃ¶ken. I have to work out this evil bastard.

27:46.686 --> 27:49.898
I'm not crazy, mom. I promise.

27:56.613 --> 28:01.617
Good boy! So it should look like! Do not stop now!

28:03.536 --> 28:07.331
- What is the problem, Bobby? - The coach did not show up.

28:07.415 --> 28:11.794
He was the fifth that got cold feet when it comes to this horse.

28:11.877 --> 28:15.172
I can train him for you.

28:15.422 --> 28:21.720
Thanks for the offer, but the coaches pulled out for a reason.

28:21.803 --> 28:24.764
For the same reason as my shoulder injury.

28:24.848 --> 28:30.770
This bastard beats up anyone who comes near him.

28:31.020 --> 28:32.522
Come again!

28:32.605 --> 28:35.942
I can tame him. I know that.

28:36.025 --> 28:43.032
I mean no offense, but this horse is not for sweet little girls.

28:44.575 --> 28:48.495
You do not have ... the guts.

28:49.288 --> 28:50.873
We should go.

28:50.956 --> 28:55.544
I do not know how it is with the stake, but my balls are big enough.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.342
How about a bet?

29:02.425 --> 29:06.721
If I manage to remain in the saddle, you cut half the price.

29:06.805 --> 29:09.807
- A third. - Settled.

29:09.933 --> 29:13.227
But you must do more than talk.

29:16.022 --> 29:19.233
Debi! Please, be careful.

29:19.317 --> 29:25.406
Do not forget that if you hurt him, you must buy him.

29:25.489 --> 29:27.658
Are you serious?

29:29.076 --> 29:31.745
You remember me?

29:31.829 --> 29:36.750
We were meant to be together, then you galloped towards me.

29:36.833 --> 29:43.548
They think we are losers, but we will show them everything, right?

29:43.631 --> 29:49.637
We will succeed and will show them how to do it.

30:27.298 --> 30:29.675
Be careful with my horse, damn!

30:29.926 --> 30:33.262
- Please, do not swear. - Yes Lady...

30:33.346 --> 30:36.891
Slowly but surely. Do not forget me in front of my mother.

30:55.659 --> 31:01.414
- Are you going to keep your end of the agreement? - I can hardly believe my eyes.

31:01.497 --> 31:05.626
I knew the bastard was quick, but Satan!

31:05.710 --> 31:09.005
I did not know he was part kangaroo.

31:09.088 --> 31:15.511
It's great. I can get the money on ... four months.

31:15.761 --> 31:21.350
A contract is a contract, but it does not apply to life.

31:21.433 --> 31:26.897
- Okay, I just need some time ... - It's not my problem, ma'am.

31:26.980 --> 31:33.194
The agreement applies today. I do not wait for your juice sales are better.

31:33.278 --> 31:38.032
- I understand, but I ... - Today will be good. We have the money.

31:39.909 --> 31:44.622
Debi, I can not touch the money that your father has put aside for you.

31:44.705 --> 31:49.126
But I've saved up some money -

31:49.210 --> 31:52.463
- A sewing machine that can be used to embroidery.

31:52.546 --> 31:58.760
It's my money that I earned. Your father has no control over them.

31:58.844 --> 32:02.931
No, Mom. I can not receive them.

32:03.014 --> 32:06.184
You have wanted to buy the sewing machine for several years.

32:06.268 --> 32:12.607
Listen to what I say. If the Lord wants you to have this horse ...

32:12.690 --> 32:17.403
Not in this way. No problem.

32:17.487 --> 32:21.115
You have already sacrificed so much for my sake and Peggy.

32:21.199 --> 32:25.661
Okay okay! Take the poor wretch only!

32:25.745 --> 32:31.166
You two are more than one man can handle.

32:32.709 --> 32:38.548
If he proves able to compete, you can pay me later.

32:38.632 --> 32:42.302
No! No! Gently!

32:42.385 --> 32:47.140
Thank you so very much! God bless you!

32:49.601 --> 32:52.020
Thanks! Thanks so much!

33:03.906 --> 33:08.911
Mom's heart must have broken when I stayed at home.

33:08.994 --> 33:11.580
But Jonathan Collier kept his word.

33:11.663 --> 33:16.251
A phone call later and I got a job in the stables on the Brae Valley Farms.

33:16.334 --> 33:22.340
And when I had time, we trained The Evangelist ...

33:27.845 --> 33:30.431
So there! Neat!

33:34.936 --> 33:39.231
- Well? - He's fast for a jumper.

33:39.315 --> 33:42.067
He will take me to the Olympics.

33:42.151 --> 33:48.699
... And the horses to be sold to wealthy customers as family Dumar.

34:18.936 --> 34:22.856
What do you think, darling, we'll make an offer?

34:35.452 --> 34:39.664
Michelin old man, you follow me like a protracted cold.

34:39.746 --> 34:43.458
- Elysse. - Miss Dumar for you.

34:43.543 --> 34:47.964
Please, I have seen you dig your panties out of the groove when you step out of the saddle.

34:48.047 --> 34:51.175
I am far from impressed by you.

34:54.011 --> 34:58.140
I know, but even Jesus lost patience with the gears.

35:02.060 --> 35:05.981
- Who is it? - It's Mr. Valentine.

35:06.231 --> 35:10.986
Henry Valentine. He made a fortune in computers.

35:11.069 --> 35:16.032
He bought a farm in Virginia Beach and intend to start breeding thoroughbreds.

35:16.115 --> 35:20.244
I do not know what I like to see his kind here.

35:20.328 --> 35:25.666
Your feelings do not matter. Mr Valentine lunch drop with presidents.

35:27.168 --> 35:30.838
- It is wrong in several ways. - Elysse.

35:33.382 --> 35:34.967
Excuse me.

35:44.893 --> 35:46.561
Bonnie.

35:48.563 --> 35:52.525
My sweet Lauren has got me on the case.

35:52.609 --> 35:57.530
- We look at the Hanoverian successor tomorrow. - You will not regret it, Kenneth.

35:57.613 --> 36:02.118
- I said exactly the same thing. - I will not contradict your future wife.

36:02.201 --> 36:04.328
Enjoy the party.

36:13.587 --> 36:15.422
100 ...

36:21.970 --> 36:24.556
120 ...

36:31.813 --> 36:33.940
130000.

36:42.198 --> 36:44.658
I must have him, sweetheart.

36:49.872 --> 36:54.084
Come on, just 30 minutes before we get back to the salt mine.

37:29.576 --> 37:32.245
Look at the horse. He is exceptional.

37:32.329 --> 37:38.043
$ 150,000 is very ridiculous. How did you get so much for it?

37:38.126 --> 37:45.133
Honeymoon Price. In a year, Kenny does not like to spend as much.

37:45.216 --> 37:48.428
So the horse is perhaps longer than the wife?

37:51.722 --> 37:57.520
- Kenneth, we've seen him before? - How much?

37:57.603 --> 38:01.065
I'm sorry, but the horse is not one of ours.

38:01.148 --> 38:03.817
And I doubt that Debi want to sell him.

38:03.901 --> 38:10.073
Debi? Debi Walden? Are you saying that Michelin old man owns the horse?

38:10.157 --> 38:16.329
Debi Walden? I've never heard of her. Is she famous?

38:16.454 --> 38:22.251
No. - How could she afford such an expensive horse?

38:22.335 --> 38:27.089
- I have not the faintest, Elysse. - Make an offer.

38:27.173 --> 38:32.011
- Elysse, you do not ... - I want that horse.

38:32.094 --> 38:38.058
If the girl does not want to sell him, it does not matter what we want.

38:38.142 --> 38:41.270
She is your student. Will she sell the horse?

39:01.581 --> 39:04.584
Here she comes.

39:05.710 --> 39:08.129
Miss Bonnie.

39:08.212 --> 39:13.050
- Well? Will you sell him? - The Evangelist?

39:13.300 --> 39:17.221
No, I can not sell him.

39:19.056 --> 39:21.767
He was a gift from the Lord.

39:23.810 --> 39:27.564
- Lord? - I did not even know he was riding.

39:32.735 --> 39:35.363
Then I go back to work.

39:39.158 --> 39:41.244
You heard her. A godsend.

39:46.373 --> 39:48.334
Vilar never?

39:50.627 --> 39:56.508
- Can I help the wife with anything? - How old do you think I am?

39:56.592 --> 40:00.804
Do not answer that. I have not been drinking enough for the truth.

40:00.887 --> 40:03.098
I wanted to visit my new baby.

40:03.348 --> 40:08.186
And to apologize for what happened earlier in the house.

40:08.269 --> 40:12.899
We think we are so hilarious when we laugh at our own jokes.

40:12.982 --> 40:18.195
Like the monkeys throw shit, and sits on the chest.

40:18.279 --> 40:23.617
Well, if there was something else, ma'am ...

40:23.701 --> 40:26.829
... I'm going to say good night.

40:31.041 --> 40:36.505
- Wait. Jonathan told me about you. - He barely know me even.

40:36.755 --> 40:39.633
Was not there.

40:39.841 --> 40:45.763
He did not allow Elysse Dumar to ridicule you. He admires you.

40:45.847 --> 40:50.810
I have never seen Jonathan Collier admire someone other than himself.

40:53.104 --> 40:57.900
It's not very original. A tough girl from the wrong side of town -

40:57.983 --> 41:04.114
- Who want to win an Olympic gold medal, which horse than she jumps.

41:05.407 --> 41:12.330
- I do not skip any horse. - And I can not judge you for it.

41:12.414 --> 41:15.709
I intend to compete with three horses this season.

41:15.792 --> 41:20.088
This beauty is my third if he delivers what he promised.

41:20.171 --> 41:22.841
You will need a second horse.

41:22.924 --> 41:26.803
You have to race as much as possible to qualify.

41:26.886 --> 41:30.973
- A horse is not enough. - The Evangelist it.

41:31.057 --> 41:37.521
No, no horse is. You will kill him if you try.

41:37.605 --> 41:42.067
You should sell him. My husband can pay enough for two horses.

41:42.151 --> 41:45.779
Ma'am, I appreciate the offer. Really.

41:45.862 --> 41:52.911
But he came to me for a reason and not to fill my piggy bank.

42:03.046 --> 42:07.883
Hold back the center of gravity. Very good.

42:07.967 --> 42:12.847
Did you notice how much space you had before you were approaching your obstacle?

42:12.930 --> 42:18.602
More time to adapt before you jump. It was well done.

42:20.437 --> 42:25.984
- Do I look like the fairy godmother? - You know you can afford it.

42:26.234 --> 42:29.613
I can afford it, because I do not waste money.

42:29.696 --> 42:34.617
It is not only the registration fee. She needs equipment, boots ...

42:34.701 --> 42:38.079
- I pay for riding boots. - You are a giver, Johnny.

42:38.162 --> 42:42.667
Bonnie, you know how good she is here. She has a chance.

42:42.917 --> 42:48.130
To achieve what? She can not compete against riders with unlimited resources.

42:48.214 --> 42:52.301
Jumping at the elite level is not too poor toughs.

42:52.384 --> 42:54.428
This is not a Disney movie.

42:54.511 --> 42:58.140
Listen to me: Sponsorship her first competition.

42:58.223 --> 43:03.895
Cover her expenses if she wins the podium.

43:06.147 --> 43:11.861
- Do you have sex? Is this about that? - No. She's not my type.

43:13.363 --> 43:18.326
There's just ... There's something about her.

43:18.409 --> 43:23.247
Bonnie, I'm serious. I want her to have a chance.

43:28.502 --> 43:32.297
I pull myself out as soon as she misses podium.

43:32.381 --> 43:36.718
And she must accomplish their work. Do you understand me?

43:36.802 --> 43:39.262
Clear.

43:57.947 --> 44:01.242
Unload him. I'll talk to the guys at the front desk.

44:01.325 --> 44:05.955
Hurry up to the stables. You only have an hour for you.

44:06.038 --> 44:08.916
I know. I can handle it, Jonathan.

45:13.019 --> 45:15.062
Good luck.

45:15.146 --> 45:18.691
- And remember: If you hesitate ... - Come on.

45:18.774 --> 45:20.734
That's right.

45:22.653 --> 45:25.989
Do your stuff. See you in a little while.

46:16.371 --> 46:21.501
It ends with a boom in the water pit for Lauren Roubidoux and Dominant.

46:21.584 --> 46:24.545
No one has passed the course with no errors so far.

46:24.629 --> 46:28.591
- It was like hell. - I hope not, ma'am.

46:28.674 --> 46:34.596
Peaches has always hated the reflection in the water.

46:34.680 --> 46:37.015
Hold his attention elsewhere.

46:37.099 --> 46:43.730
The last pair is The Evangelist and his owner, Debi Walden.

46:46.107 --> 46:49.527
Excuse me, Miss Brae. They called right up your riders.

46:49.611 --> 46:53.156
Thank you, Mr Valentine. I heard that.

47:09.380 --> 47:13.342
I see that we come to the goose that lays the golden egg.

47:14.551 --> 47:18.221
Forgive me, Elysse. I must have missed your attempt.

47:33.027 --> 47:36.072
Four errors and a time penalty.

47:36.155 --> 47:40.076
I do not think my horse has the necessary experience.

48:01.638 --> 48:05.266
Ladies and gentlemen, those were the only couple without error.

48:05.350 --> 48:10.605
And it was a flawless round of Debi Walden and The Evangelist -

48:10.688 --> 48:13.649
- Making them the winners of LexingtontrofÃ©n.

48:13.733 --> 48:17.361
Inga fel or penalty.

48:17.611 --> 48:22.157
It seems that the hen hit you, Elysse.

48:22.241 --> 48:25.452
What was it you said about the experience?

48:34.503 --> 48:38.631
It was the first of many sudden gains.

48:38.715 --> 48:43.052
But then we fell down to other places, followed by the third places.

48:43.136 --> 48:48.432
Then I realized that Lauren, wife Roubidoux, was right.

48:48.516 --> 48:53.437
The competition was too tough for a single horse, even Evengelisten.

48:53.521 --> 48:56.440
In no way did I get on a horse.

48:56.524 --> 49:00.986
No no no! Unload the horses and get out of here, Alex.

49:01.070 --> 49:05.073
- I do not even want to see your dog food. - Come on, Miss Bonnie ...

49:05.157 --> 49:09.911
Do not try. You'll find the wretched horses and try to sell them as stars.

49:09.995 --> 49:14.124
I already said it before: I'm going to call the sheriff.

49:14.207 --> 49:20.255
Look. The feed you even your horses? They are just skin and bones.

49:20.338 --> 49:23.007
- How the hell did you get them? - I can take her.

49:28.054 --> 49:30.222
Okay, what is she doing?

49:32.391 --> 49:38.105
Load them. Everybody. I do not need more glue.

49:38.188 --> 49:42.693
- Bonnie! - Come on, girl. Do your stuff.

50:11.345 --> 50:15.390
Come on, Bonnie. She is small but sweet ...

50:15.474 --> 50:21.104
Alex, look at me. I did not even cry when Old Yeller got shot.

50:21.188 --> 50:24.900
How much?

50:24.983 --> 50:28.570
- 2000 1800 - 1000.

50:28.653 --> 50:31.698
- 1600. - 1200.

50:31.781 --> 50:37.745
- 1500 is my last offer. - Sure, I can get the money on ...

50:37.829 --> 50:43.334
I can not go along with it, baby. I want to get the money directly.

50:43.584 --> 50:50.382
- But, I just need some time. - Debi, do not live beyond your means.

50:50.466 --> 50:54.720
- Bonnie, please. - No, I already feeding a horse for you.

50:54.803 --> 51:00.684
She is also too small for male riders who invest in gold.

51:00.767 --> 51:03.937
But you know I'm good for it.

51:06.481 --> 51:13.029
It's okay, baby girl. It just was not your turn.

51:16.365 --> 51:19.410
For God's sake, Kenneth, bring out the checkbook.

51:21.328 --> 51:25.916
- Lauren, we do not need to ... - Just do it, honey.

51:26.000 --> 51:31.964
You will not miss the money. I see that you do not.

51:32.047 --> 51:34.132
Oh my God!

51:36.718 --> 51:40.305
Thanks. Thank you very much.

51:52.483 --> 51:55.987
- How can I ever thank you? - Do not do it.

52:02.076 --> 52:08.540
There was not a gift. Your partner is expecting a refund.

52:10.876 --> 52:14.421
You were right about the reflection on the water.

52:14.504 --> 52:17.382
We'll see if you're right about her.

52:21.052 --> 52:25.473
Perfect step, very good. Shorten the reins.

52:27.266 --> 52:29.894
- Good. - Hey, Bonnie.

52:33.147 --> 52:37.401
Everything that girl annoys me.

52:37.484 --> 52:42.531
We run a business. It is a tough market for thick-skinned people.

52:42.614 --> 52:46.285
She gallops up on his horse and bolts of Jesus.

52:46.368 --> 52:50.872
- I just want to give her a slap. - Yes Yes.

52:50.956 --> 52:55.585
- She may never be a Sunday horse. - You know what, Bonnie?

52:55.668 --> 52:59.672
All believe that a Sunday horse wins championships on Sunday.

52:59.756 --> 53:05.011
- But I do not think that's right. - Of course not, honey.

53:06.596 --> 53:10.599
I think a Sunday horse proves that miracles can happen.

53:10.683 --> 53:15.020
A true Sunday horse wins despite all setbacks.

53:15.104 --> 53:17.439
Okay then.

53:17.523 --> 53:23.487
So I guess you will rename the mare to the Miracle or something similar.

53:23.570 --> 53:27.741
I preferred God's Own, but Mr Roubidoux slammed almost off.

53:27.824 --> 53:31.119
So we contented ourselves with a Touch of Class.

53:35.081 --> 53:38.918
DEBI WALDEN VÃRLDSRANKAD the hard way

53:39.002 --> 53:41.254
RIDERS AIMING UP

53:41.337 --> 53:44.048
DEBI WINNER SPRUCE MEADOWS

53:44.131 --> 53:48.344
DEBI WALDEN VINNER IGEN VID LAKE PLACID

53:48.427 --> 53:52.556
She won up at Lake Placid.

53:52.640 --> 53:59.605
She writes that the next race is in DC And we can get tickets.

54:02.774 --> 54:07.362
She is our girl, Larry. And it goes really well for her.

54:09.322 --> 54:14.827
You can include Peggy there. I must work with my defenders.

54:50.778 --> 54:54.991
So far three riders passed the course without any errors.

54:55.074 --> 54:59.078
The last pair out to try and achieve the same score -

54:59.161 --> 55:02.790
- Debi's Walden riding Touch of Class.

55:49.334 --> 55:53.547
It is a flawless round of Debi Walden and Touch of Class.

55:53.630 --> 55:58.885
They end up at the top with Claudia Cologne riding Cocolea ...

55:58.968 --> 56:02.305
- We have to talk. - Yes we must.

56:02.388 --> 56:06.559
... And Lauren Roubidoux on Criss Cross on the shorter course against the clock.

56:08.311 --> 56:14.316
I do not care if it's for the best. I hate it. Debi was incredible today.

56:14.400 --> 56:20.864
And even if she wins the jumping we should reflect on the layup.

56:20.948 --> 56:27.120
We are wasting Touch of Class on an inexperienced rider?

56:27.204 --> 56:30.165
And it wants to replace her against a male riders.

56:30.248 --> 56:35.003
Lauren, you've been around long enough to know how it works.

56:35.086 --> 56:41.259
If Debi wins, she proves to Touch of Class can reach all the way to the Olympics.

56:41.342 --> 56:43.928
I want Jonathan ride her.

56:44.011 --> 56:50.684
At this level and with this possibility a man must take over.

56:50.768 --> 56:56.607
Jonathan is still among the best men and investing in gold.

56:56.857 --> 57:00.569
I do not like it, but it is best for Touch of Class.

57:00.652 --> 57:03.405
I do not agree.

57:04.740 --> 57:08.702
I took Touch of Class here and I can take her all the way.

57:11.621 --> 57:16.668
- Did you know about this? - No, I've never heard it before.

57:16.751 --> 57:20.546
And I do not want to be a part of it, okay?

57:22.340 --> 57:26.594
You can not do this. I own Touch of Class.

57:26.677 --> 57:32.057
You own a third of Touch of Class. I own the rest and I want to ...

57:32.308 --> 57:37.688
No, you own a third, and so do I..

57:37.771 --> 57:40.691
And it makes Debi.

57:41.650 --> 57:46.071
Debi, win the race. Show what you are capable of.

57:47.489 --> 57:51.826
If Debi do not win, then we'll see what happens.

57:54.370 --> 57:56.748
It's damn true that we'll see.

57:56.831 --> 58:01.168
- When did you tell me this? - We'll talk about it later.

58:03.087 --> 58:07.466
I want to talk to the young lady. Follow me.

58:18.435 --> 58:24.899
Claudia Cologne and Cocolea takes the lead with a time of 39.33 seconds.

58:58.348 --> 59:03.394
The last round ended at 38.27 for Joann Netlaw and Corteez.

59:03.478 --> 59:07.732
Unfortunately when the only other place with four faults on the last boom.

59:12.820 --> 59:15.072
It looks good.

59:38.011 --> 59:40.847
37.59 seconds.

59:40.930 --> 59:46.477
Lauren Roubidoux and Criss Cross takes the lead with a quick game.

59:46.769 --> 59:50.106
Last out is Debi Walden and Touch of Class.

59:50.189 --> 59:54.693
We'll see if the time around the course without error.

01:00:17.799 --> 01:00:20.885
Amazing 37.34 seconds!

01:00:20.969 --> 01:00:24.514
Debi Walden with Touch of Class survived all obstacles -

01:00:24.597 --> 01:00:30.352
- Take any shortcuts and win Washington International Cup.

01:00:42.281 --> 01:00:47.744
After our conflict was Mr Valentines invitation a blessing.

01:00:47.827 --> 01:00:54.083
Before I bought the building I used to sell newspapers on the street corner.

01:00:54.167 --> 01:00:58.129
And it was a long road that brought me to where I am today.

01:00:58.212 --> 01:01:01.257
So I recognize the challenges before you.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:06.470
There seems to be equally little place for women of black horse owners.

01:01:06.554 --> 01:01:10.391
If we do not suede square stables and I'm tired of it.

01:01:10.474 --> 01:01:15.813
People I do not even know will take a decision on my future.

01:01:15.896 --> 01:01:18.941
People who I should be able to trust stabs me in the back.

01:01:19.024 --> 01:01:23.987
- I can not take it. - I thought so.

01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:29.576
I knew I met a soul mate the first time we met.

01:01:29.701 --> 01:01:35.748
- When Elysse Dumar got the crap out of me? - When you put Elysse Dumar in place.

01:01:41.128 --> 01:01:45.674
You will understand that I already have an Olympic rider Scott.

01:01:45.758 --> 01:01:48.302
He represents me on the track.

01:01:48.385 --> 01:01:53.390
I need you as a backup if Scott can not compete.

01:01:53.473 --> 01:01:57.477
Besides that you will answer to Miss Rose, Sandra.

01:01:57.561 --> 01:02:02.482
Sandra manages the farm and you do everything that she asks.

01:02:02.565 --> 01:02:09.280
I'm not afraid to work. You can ask anyone who knows me.

01:02:09.364 --> 01:02:13.159
I suede square stable. I ask myself as a reserve behind Scott.

01:02:13.242 --> 01:02:18.164
But you sponsor me and my horses even though I compete against Scott.

01:02:18.247 --> 01:02:22.293
- I have beaten you twice. - Two times out of how many?

01:02:22.376 --> 01:02:26.630
Do not try to beat your weight class, baby.

01:02:30.676 --> 01:02:35.931
We are probably on the same page, and I'm not talking only about your role as a rider.

01:02:36.014 --> 01:02:40.226
We have been facing people trying to tell us -

01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:45.356
- How to live, where to be, what we should do to achieve our goals.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:49.485
It makes us more than an employee and employer.

01:02:49.569 --> 01:02:53.990
This means that we are related.

01:02:55.491 --> 01:02:58.035
Yes, it makes us related.

01:03:00.037 --> 01:03:03.457
Welcome to the family Debi.

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:08.086
Welcome to Trinity Farms.

01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:12.382
Maybe it was not like when The Evangelist galloped forward.

01:03:12.466 --> 01:03:15.427
I heard maybe not the Lord's voice.

01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:19.264
But I knew that the Lord had given me, Mr. Valentine.

01:03:19.514 --> 01:03:23.226
It's too dark in the White House. Much like the horse show.

01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:45.914
I guess you do not fear that your partner call you horse thief.

01:03:45.998 --> 01:03:51.211
I am co-owner and trainer, as Touch of Class with me.

01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:56.216
Okay, but you understand well that it does not change anything?

01:03:56.299 --> 01:04:01.846
Kenneth and Lauren have a larger share. The rider can switch if they want.

01:04:01.929 --> 01:04:06.934
Maybe so, but Mr Valentine would not walk me behind my back.

01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:12.773
So here it is ... You ...

01:04:14.858 --> 01:04:16.402
Of...

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:22.866
I owe you more than I can ever repay.

01:04:24.576 --> 01:04:29.706
I still had smoked me stupid and worked in Coeur Blue -

01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:33.209
- If you have not had lit the fire within me.

01:04:36.963 --> 01:04:40.091
- You changed my life. - I did not even ...

01:04:40.174 --> 01:04:46.138
Do not interrupt me. You are a blessing, Jonathan Collier.

01:04:49.183 --> 01:04:52.686
I will never forget you or what you have done for me.

01:05:00.110 --> 01:05:05.031
It is best that you leave before Bonnie counting the horses.

01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:22.965
Take care of yourself, okay?

01:05:26.177 --> 01:05:27.761
Okay.

01:06:02.628 --> 01:06:05.339
- Good morning, Mr. Valentine. - Good morning.

01:06:07.007 --> 01:06:11.720
I would start with local news. You have a new winner.

01:06:11.803 --> 01:06:13.221
DEBI WALDEN WINS AGAIN!

01:06:13.305 --> 01:06:16.766
Excellent, Lois. It will be good PR for the Trinity.

01:06:33.157 --> 01:06:38.954
- Mr Valentine? - Send flowers from us to Debi.

01:06:39.038 --> 01:06:42.207
Much colors. Very yellow.

01:06:42.291 --> 01:06:47.629
The card read: "Continue to beat your weight class."

01:07:46.477 --> 01:07:48.813
We will need a bigger wall.

01:07:50.856 --> 01:07:54.193
Horses are apparently all the rage this year.

01:08:12.836 --> 01:08:15.004
Is it a Pony?

01:08:21.344 --> 01:08:22.678
Come now.

01:08:24.596 --> 01:08:26.140
Come on.

01:08:34.898 --> 01:08:37.859
Why are we in somebody dumboms barn?

01:08:37.943 --> 01:08:41.654
We are here, Tyrel, Sir Valentine invited us.

01:08:41.738 --> 01:08:46.158
He owns Trinity Farms and was named "Entrepreneur of the Year".

01:08:46.242 --> 01:08:52.290
He has agreed to show us his wonderful farm.

01:08:52.372 --> 01:08:57.295
So be kind to thank him for it.

01:08:57.377 --> 01:09:01.924
You'd think he could afford anything without flies.

01:09:08.846 --> 01:09:15.020
So how is it that a rich man that you want to own a farm?

01:09:15.103 --> 01:09:19.441
You would be able to own an NBA-low.

01:09:19.524 --> 01:09:24.529
- You need a hip-hop rather stable. - A genuine stable?

01:09:24.612 --> 01:09:27.240
We do not fit in horses.

01:09:27.323 --> 01:09:33.287
Tyrel, did you know that the first winner in Kentucky was black?

01:09:33.371 --> 01:09:36.666
Oliver Lewis som red Aristedes.

01:09:36.916 --> 01:09:43.214
Or that black jockeys won 15 of the first 28 races?

01:09:43.296 --> 01:09:49.511
Or that the first who was voted to the Jockey Hall of Fame was black?

01:09:51.305 --> 01:09:54.975
All black jockeys, but a white girl riding for you.

01:09:55.058 --> 01:09:59.437
Dr. King said: "Do not judge others by his hudfÃ¤rd -

01:09:59.521 --> 01:10:02.398
- But by their character's content. "

01:10:02.482 --> 01:10:06.110
Debi ride for me because she has character.

01:10:06.194 --> 01:10:12.658
And she can find the horses' wings which leads to my benefit.

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:19.290
We go to the training ring. Debi will showcase my newest horse.

01:10:19.373 --> 01:10:21.000
Miss Brand. Follow me.

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:27.214
- Are you here because of your character? - I hope so.

01:10:27.297 --> 01:10:32.302
Yes, ugly girls have no character.

01:10:36.473 --> 01:10:39.809
Damn! Damn!

01:10:58.744 --> 01:11:01.997
That's cool! She skipped!

01:11:13.341 --> 01:11:15.218
It was a high jump.

01:11:18.429 --> 01:11:19.931
I also want to do it.

01:11:36.613 --> 01:11:38.240
Debi!

01:11:41.702 --> 01:11:45.705
Come here. Come here.

01:12:00.845 --> 01:12:04.432
My daughter, Debi Walden, is posted here after a riding accident.

01:12:04.515 --> 01:12:09.395
I have to meet her and talk to her doctor.

01:12:09.478 --> 01:12:11.021
I'll get the doctor.

01:12:11.272 --> 01:12:17.110
- Mr Valetine, have you heard anything? - The doctor just talk with relatives.

01:12:17.194 --> 01:12:22.365
He does it right in. So get out of here before you do more damage.

01:12:22.449 --> 01:12:27.370
- This is not Mr. Valentine wrong. - Yes it is.

01:12:27.454 --> 01:12:30.206
She rode his horse, right?

01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:35.503
You put my little girl in danger, and now she is fighting for life.

01:12:35.586 --> 01:12:39.090
- Mr. and Mrs. Walden? - Come on, honey.

01:12:41.175 --> 01:12:46.055
This only concerns the family. We would appreciate to be left alone.

01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:52.561
Can you help me? I want to pay all the costs of Debis care.

01:12:52.644 --> 01:12:56.106
Yes. I just have to fill in a few forms.

01:12:57.107 --> 01:13:01.528
Debis CT indicates brain edema. She's in a coma.

01:13:01.611 --> 01:13:04.447
However, her condition stabilized.

01:13:04.531 --> 01:13:10.036
- Will Debi to get by? - We can answer it when she wakes up.

01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:13.372
- How long will it be? - We can not answer that.

01:13:13.456 --> 01:13:18.210
Debi does not respond to touch, but we do not know if it is the damage -

01:13:18.294 --> 01:13:21.088
- Or if she has damaged spinal cord.

01:13:21.172 --> 01:13:26.969
- What "does not respond to touch?" - She seems paralyzed on the left side.

01:13:27.052 --> 01:13:28.971
Darling.

01:13:30.681 --> 01:13:33.058
We want to meet our daughter.

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:05.354
Doktor Blair. Doctor Jay Hamilton.

01:15:22.371 --> 01:15:25.624
Ms. Walden is on line one.

01:15:25.707 --> 01:15:27.792
That's good news.

01:15:29.419 --> 01:15:31.963
It's very good news.

01:15:33.298 --> 01:15:38.428
I do not know how good it was when everything comes around.

01:15:38.511 --> 01:15:42.598
Ten days in a coma felt like a day at the beach -

01:15:42.682 --> 01:15:48.354
- Compared to six months of grueling physical therapy.

01:15:48.437 --> 01:15:52.066
Come on, girl.

01:15:52.316 --> 01:15:56.778
You come back into the saddle. I see you jump.

01:15:58.238 --> 01:16:00.949
But I will not lie.

01:16:01.032 --> 01:16:06.496
Sometimes I just wanted to curl up and tell everyone to stay away.

01:16:06.579 --> 01:16:10.333
You can do it, Debi. One more step.

01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:19.967
Lovely, Debi. Now, go on your own.

01:16:22.261 --> 01:16:23.679
Good work.

01:16:28.892 --> 01:16:34.690
But the hardest thing was to sell my share of Touch of Class.

01:16:34.773 --> 01:16:37.943
The most difficult, but the right thing to do.

01:17:36.582 --> 01:17:39.752
Welcome home, Debi.

01:17:39.835 --> 01:17:45.340
- I missed you, Mr Valentine. - I really wanted to visit you.

01:17:45.424 --> 01:17:50.470
- But your dad ... - I know. No one said anything about it.

01:17:50.554 --> 01:17:55.392
But the most important thing is you are here and that you feel good.

01:17:55.475 --> 01:17:57.894
I have missed you so much.

01:18:00.230 --> 01:18:02.315
House!

01:18:10.031 --> 01:18:11.407
Hey!

01:18:14.827 --> 01:18:18.914
He is in good shape. I've taken him out every day.

01:18:18.997 --> 01:18:24.836
- Though he will not let anyone else ride him. - Thanks. I owe you one.

01:18:30.175 --> 01:18:32.969
They are here to download the Touch of Class.

01:18:38.099 --> 01:18:41.769
She is still in the stable. Take the time you need.

01:18:52.947 --> 01:18:58.452
I hate it, my little girl. I hate it more than you know.

01:18:58.535 --> 01:19:04.249
But ... you deserve more than I can offer.

01:19:04.332 --> 01:19:07.335
You deserve a chance to fly.

01:19:08.878 --> 01:19:14.133
You deserve to participate in the Olympics. You deserve a gold.

01:19:14.217 --> 01:19:18.429
I promise to give her that opportunity.

01:19:18.513 --> 01:19:22.266
Kyle Brooks. I ride to ...

01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:28.147
I know who you are and Touch of Class is in good company.

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:33.610
You can beat this. I see the fire that burns within you.

01:20:01.512 --> 01:20:05.349
She likes persimmon.

01:20:05.432 --> 01:20:11.021
She prefers them immature. She does not eat ripe berries.

01:20:11.105 --> 01:20:13.523
I will not forget.

01:20:19.529 --> 01:20:22.574
Neither do I.

01:20:27.036 --> 01:20:31.124
You nearly died when you wanted to show you this stiff before Mr. Valentine.

01:20:31.207 --> 01:20:36.921
And now you tell me that you'd rather live with him than at home with us?

01:20:37.004 --> 01:20:42.551
I appeared not on rigid line. My case was not his fault.

01:20:43.969 --> 01:20:49.558
Riders can get hurt. It is a risk we are willing to take.

01:20:54.938 --> 01:20:59.317
I have to stay at the Trinity because it is closer to Claudia, my physiotherapist -

01:20:59.401 --> 01:21:05.156
- And closer to The Evangelist. He needs me and I need him.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:08.993
Why? You will hardly be able to ride again.

01:21:13.039 --> 01:21:18.127
I will ride again, trÃ¤narn. I will ride again.

01:21:22.423 --> 01:21:25.134
17 and hold.

01:21:29.388 --> 01:21:34.059
- 18. Raka ben -. 4027 ...

01:21:36.019 --> 01:21:41.941
- How long do I continue? - Until you can put your foot in the stirrup.

01:21:42.025 --> 01:21:47.238
Do you get paid better for your patients die from overwork?

01:21:47.321 --> 01:21:50.241
Yes, it is in the fine print.

01:22:09.259 --> 01:22:15.473
They face the last jumps. The gold is theirs if they can handle them without error.

01:22:17.308 --> 01:22:23.523
Bullseye. OS -guldet goes to Touch of Class. Unbelievable.

01:22:26.734 --> 01:22:32.114
It was a fantastic performance by Kyle Brooks and Touch of Class.

01:22:32.198 --> 01:22:36.326
The other gold goes to the US, which has the world's best horses.

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:37.494
Debi!

01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:40.581
Men bet on gold.

01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:59.932
Come on. Give me some more. Good.

01:23:36.008 --> 01:23:39.929
17. Good. 18th

01:23:47.895 --> 01:23:50.647
Yes! So it should look like!

01:23:59.322 --> 01:24:02.909
A ... Finished! Neat!

01:24:27.474 --> 01:24:30.811
- Was it good enough? - Okay ...

01:24:30.894 --> 01:24:35.482
Okay, I would register to the Governor's Cup.

01:24:35.732 --> 01:24:39.444
Are you okay? Debi?

01:24:39.527 --> 01:24:43.156
I feel good ... I feel good ...

01:24:48.953 --> 01:24:50.580
Oh my God!

01:24:55.126 --> 01:24:58.837
Epilepsy? I do not have epilepsy.

01:24:58.921 --> 01:25:04.927
Yesterday. Yesterday you did not have epilepsy. Today you have it.

01:25:05.010 --> 01:25:08.847
- Why is this happening to me? - I can not answer that.

01:25:09.097 --> 01:25:13.310
The good news is that we can write a recipe for epilepsy.

01:25:13.393 --> 01:25:16.438
It does not change your life if you just engages you.

01:25:16.521 --> 01:25:22.277
- Can I still ride? - Ride? Certainly.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:28.991
But what you are really asking is whether you can compete in show jumping.

01:25:33.454 --> 01:25:39.293
Debi, you have already suffered a serious brain injury.

01:25:39.376 --> 01:25:45.173
If you experience an epileptic seizure in the saddle and fall back ...

01:25:45.257 --> 01:25:48.468
A second injury can kill you.

01:25:50.762 --> 01:25:54.099
Are you listening to me? You can die.

01:26:13.409 --> 01:26:20.082
Larry, I love you, even if it has not always been easy.

01:26:20.207 --> 01:26:23.543
Now I want you to listen to me.

01:26:23.627 --> 01:26:30.550
Our girl has sent us tickets to Governor's Cup this year.

01:26:30.633 --> 01:26:35.722
After everything that she has undergone. After next have died.

01:26:35.805 --> 01:26:38.766
After being forced to learn to walk again.

01:26:38.850 --> 01:26:42.186
After we all said that she should quit.

01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:47.775
Our daughter was competing again and we'll be there to support her.

01:26:49.652 --> 01:26:54.406
I know you think she betrayed us when she chose to go his own way.

01:26:54.490 --> 01:27:00.245
But, Larry, that's what kids are supposed to do.

01:27:00.328 --> 01:27:04.082
They can not be young forever.

01:27:04.207 --> 01:27:09.629
It would prevent their development, and we should not feel alone.

01:27:44.829 --> 01:27:49.375
Ladies and gentlemen, the riders walk the course before the last round -

01:27:49.625 --> 01:27:54.463
- Of this year's Governor's Cup. And with the country's top horses ...

01:27:54.547 --> 01:28:00.094
Michelin old man, how nice to see you. I mean, look at you.

01:28:00.177 --> 01:28:06.100
You have to focus on the details for discovering mount your horse.

01:28:06.392 --> 01:28:10.896
And the leg? There is barely anything.

01:28:10.979 --> 01:28:15.484
It's hard to see something with your head up card in the ass, Elysse.

01:28:17.277 --> 01:28:21.489
We'll see who laughs last, Michelin old man.

01:29:29.846 --> 01:29:34.392
Debi Walden and The Evangelist is on the verge of moving forward.

01:29:34.476 --> 01:29:40.231
Who would have thought it a year ago when she was in a coma after an accident.

01:29:40.314 --> 01:29:44.068
No one thought she could ride again, and do not really compete.

01:29:44.318 --> 01:29:49.031
And with the spotless round has four horses moved on.

01:29:49.115 --> 01:29:51.408
These couples are without doubt the best ...

01:29:51.659 --> 01:29:54.745
Mom, Debi were wonderful!

01:29:54.828 --> 01:29:59.041
Dad can say what he wants, but he misses something big.

01:29:59.124 --> 01:30:02.169
We'll tell you when we get home.

01:30:02.252 --> 01:30:06.006
The best of the best: Is it Lauren Roubidoux and Dominant?

01:30:07.882 --> 01:30:10.176
Elysse Dumar and COJI?

01:30:11.803 --> 01:30:16.683
The Olympic champions Kyle Brooks and Touch of Class?

01:30:19.519 --> 01:30:22.521
Or Debi Walden and The Evangelist?

01:30:22.605 --> 01:30:26.484
Before Debis accident, rode and she trained Touch of Class.

01:30:26.567 --> 01:30:31.280
And taken from a fairy tale, they will now meet in the final.

01:31:00.808 --> 01:31:05.354
Lauren Roubidoux and Dominant takes the lead -

01:31:05.437 --> 01:31:10.609
- With a game without errors in 32.2 seconds.

01:31:10.859 --> 01:31:15.155
The next pair is the ever popular Elysse Dumar and COJI.

01:31:28.084 --> 01:31:29.919
Good luck, Debi.

01:31:31.421 --> 01:31:33.339
Tack, Kyle.

01:31:33.464 --> 01:31:36.550
You never cease to amaze.

01:31:36.634 --> 01:31:41.680
I know. I was there when I hit you. And I can beat Touch of Class.

01:31:59.155 --> 01:32:06.204
32.1 seconds. A quick game to make up four faults.

01:32:06.287 --> 01:32:10.917
It gives Elysse Dumar and COJI second place.

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:16.130
If I cut inside the last hurdle I earn a second.

01:32:16.213 --> 01:32:22.136
But if you take that route, you have only a couple of steps before the final hurdle.

01:32:22.219 --> 01:32:29.101
- And you can not risk falling off. - Who told you about my epilepsy?

01:32:29.184 --> 01:32:33.271
Did you really think that others would not get out?

01:32:33.355 --> 01:32:38.902
You should know that someone cares want you ride smart.

01:32:38.985 --> 01:32:41.154
Jonathan Collier...

01:32:41.237 --> 01:32:46.200
You really are a really bloated type.

01:32:46.284 --> 01:32:49.704
But I've never met a better man.

01:32:49.954 --> 01:32:53.707
Touch of Class and gold medalist Kyle Brooks ...

01:32:53.791 --> 01:32:57.670
- Was that a no? - ... Is the competition's big favorites.

01:33:30.075 --> 01:33:35.539
Incredible 31.4 seconds! A flawless round, giving them the lead.

01:33:35.789 --> 01:33:42.462
And only a few remain. We may have seen the winner.

01:33:42.587 --> 01:33:48.009
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's final is Debi Walden and The Evangelist.

01:33:48.093 --> 01:33:51.763
It is a tremendous achievement by Debi even compete again -

01:33:51.846 --> 01:33:56.059
- After an accident six months ago. She's looking for a miracle.

01:33:56.142 --> 01:34:00.396
Do not listen to him, Evan. Just listen to my voice.

01:34:00.479 --> 01:34:03.482
You are my miracle and I'm yours.

01:34:03.607 --> 01:34:07.403
Now we show them how to do it.

01:34:08.862 --> 01:34:13.534
- She has surprised against all odds. - Bullshit! Show what you can, Debi!

01:34:14.535 --> 01:34:19.831
View all fucking sprÃ¤ttar how to do!

01:34:55.449 --> 01:34:59.369
Come on, you old fuck horse!

01:35:12.965 --> 01:35:15.676
If I cut inside the last hurdle I earn a second.

01:35:19.763 --> 01:35:23.934
But if you take that route, you have only a couple of steps before the final hurdle.

01:35:24.018 --> 01:35:26.812
And you can not risk falling off.

01:35:53.504 --> 01:35:59.927
Ladies and gentlemen! Tonight's winner is Debi Walden and The Evangelist!

01:36:02.179 --> 01:36:05.057
I told Evan could do it.

01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:07.601
Remind me to never advise you again.

01:36:07.726 --> 01:36:10.103
How did it go? What time did I get?

01:36:10.187 --> 01:36:14.941
... Did it in 31.0 seconds and wins Governor's Cup!

01:36:24.909 --> 01:36:27.036
Debi, my little girl!

01:36:30.998 --> 01:36:36.879
Giving this year's champion applause: Debi Walden and The Evangelist!

01:36:52.102 --> 01:36:55.063
Excuse me, can you take a picture of me and my family?

01:37:07.158 --> 01:37:11.829
Debi want a picture with his family.

01:37:11.912 --> 01:37:14.039
The whole family.

01:37:25.842 --> 01:37:31.139
According to the book of Job, the Lord speaks to us in our dreams.

01:37:31.222 --> 01:37:36.436
But the Lord spoke to me through a brown horse's eye.

01:37:36.686 --> 01:37:40.231
The Evangelist was my best friend for over 25 years.

01:37:40.314 --> 01:37:44.151
Whatever we were facing, we did it together.

01:37:44.235 --> 01:37:48.155
Many losses and more wins than we thought possible.

01:37:48.239 --> 01:37:52.785
But despite the profit or loss we never lost our passion.

01:37:52.868 --> 01:37:56.705
Our love to jump together.

01:37:56.788 --> 01:38:02.210
I had never dared hope to be as close to heaven in this life.

01:38:07.674 --> 01:38:09.759
Ahead, boy.

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:14.680
Not? Evan, it's unlike you.

01:38:24.023 --> 01:38:29.319
Did you see that? Passion has never played in the manger before.

01:38:30.654 --> 01:38:34.408
Evan is the only one of my horses that do.

01:38:34.491 --> 01:38:37.953
Teach you out of your bad habits?

01:38:38.161 --> 01:38:41.831
You do not think I remember you otherwise?

01:38:46.252 --> 01:38:49.964
Debi. It's time now.

01:38:51.507 --> 01:38:54.135
Evan har have.

01:38:55.386 --> 01:38:59.014
I know. I know.

01:39:02.226 --> 01:39:05.312
I lead him out myself.

01:39:06.563 --> 01:39:11.026
- Give me just a few minutes. - As you wish.

01:39:18.116 --> 01:39:20.660
How should I handle this?

01:41:14.227 --> 01:41:20.358
Three words sum up everything I've learned about life: It goes on

01:41:20.382 --> 01:41:25.382
