[Ray] Welcome to the 19th Semi-Annual
Rustland City Thanksgiving Day Parade.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.601
And our parade would not be complete

00:18.685 --> 00:21.980
without a visit
from America's favorite cartoon lazybones,

00:22.063 --> 00:23.481
Sleepy Ramirez.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.233
[all cheering]

00:25.316 --> 00:28.987
Fun fact, Sleepy is
the only anatomically correct balloon

00:29.070 --> 00:30.363
in the parade today.

200 gallon-sized cans

00:38.496 --> 00:39.914
of latex house paint.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.666
[Jim] You stink, Ray!

00:41.750 --> 00:46.212
You're a disgrace to ceremony mastering!

There's no peanuts in it! Wait! [screams]

My ride's got a boy
with a dick on his face.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.746
And just like that boy,
you got to put on a smile and take it.

Maybe it wouldn't happen
if you got out of the way of progress!

01:37.055 --> 01:41.684
Your progress is going to put my people
on the street! They all hate you!

01:41.768 --> 01:46.773
We'll see how they feel after they get
one of my Tollway Tom Turkeys!

This progress looks delicious!

01:57.575 --> 01:59.661
He's turning my people against me.

10:29.503 --> 10:32.590
Fine, but if he gives me any lip,

10:32.673 --> 10:37.053
we have backup reservations
at the Szechuan Palace.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.430
They do a fantastic white rice.

Hey, lady, can you hurry up?
I got my baby in the car.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.367
Well, I got places to be too, you know.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.328
Aw, bullshit! You're buying cat food
on Thanksgiving.

[baby babbling]

11:04.580 --> 11:08.167
-Hey, happy Turkey Day, Gooms!
-Uh, hey-a, Vic. What, uh...

11:08.250 --> 11:09.794
What are you doing here?

11:09.877 --> 11:14.340
Worried about what wild animal left
that surprise on your walkway last night?

11:14.423 --> 11:17.551
No, man, from the looks of that poop,
he's not gonna be around much longer.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.304
Something eating him alive
from the inside, know what I mean?

11:20.388 --> 11:23.182
-It's like a goddamn alien in there.
-[baby crying]

11:23.265 --> 11:27.019
Say, I need some advice
on how to calm down Vic Junior here.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.354
You guys have kids, right?

11:28.437 --> 11:30.523
-[groans]
-Uh...

11:30.606 --> 11:32.858
No, Vic, we don't.

[crying]

11:38.698 --> 11:41.158
Aw, man, I don't know where else to turn.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.577
I knocked at Chet's place,
but he didn't answer.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.246
Let me try to soothe him.

11:45.329 --> 11:49.041
-Oh, it's okay, Evie. You don't have to.
-I already am!

11:49.125 --> 11:51.544
There you go. Evie's got you now.

11:51.627 --> 11:54.755
Oh, thank you. You two are good people.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.257
Uh...

11:56.340 --> 11:58.759
Yeah.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.722
In just four short hours,
Buster Thunder Junior

12:02.805 --> 12:06.517
will jump the Los Angeles River,
a majestic body of water

12:06.600 --> 12:09.854
that flows with the waste
of Hollywood's biggest stars.

12:09.937 --> 12:13.733
So, where's that brother of yours?

12:13.816 --> 12:16.152
Maybe he was arrested
at the bus station.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.570
-Again.
-Dad!

12:17.653 --> 12:21.782
Pardon me for acknowledging
the lavender elephant in the room.

Louis.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.080
Oh, son, I hope you didn't hear

12:28.164 --> 12:32.126
the horrible thing
your father just said about you.

12:32.209 --> 12:33.294
I did.

[dramatic music crescendos]

12:36.756 --> 12:37.673
Ah!

12:37.757 --> 12:38.758
I love you.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.469
And I forgive you.

12:41.552 --> 12:44.346
Well, this is, uh, quite the hello.

12:44.430 --> 12:48.893
I know I'm not supposed to say anything,
but you're so courageous.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.144
[Stan] Courageous?

12:50.227 --> 12:52.354
I'm not afraid of catching anything.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.398
Just don't touch
that scraped knuckle, okay?

12:54.482 --> 12:57.109
Oh, this is wonderful.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.653
Yeah, so great.
How about some mulled wine?

12:59.737 --> 13:02.114
I want us to get along, son.

13:02.198 --> 13:05.326
This has been eating
at the pit of my stomach.

-I practice with the dog every night.

don't need solid food.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.138
Very cool.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.099
So, uh, what'd you do
to get him to be so calm?

13:29.183 --> 13:32.228
If I told you that,
you'd never bring him back.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.480
[chuckles] Oh, yeah,
you're probably right.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.982
Well, I don't want to interfere
with your Thanksgiving. We should go.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.527
No. I'm not finished yet.

13:39.610 --> 13:42.530
But I promised the little guy I'd teach
him how to adjust a carburetor, so--

13:42.613 --> 13:44.490
-I said back off!
-[Goomer chuckles]

13:44.573 --> 13:46.408
Well, you heard her.

13:46.492 --> 13:49.161
Why don't you have a tall glass
of Goomer's special eggnog,

13:49.245 --> 13:52.331
and we'll catch up on neighborhood gossip
when you wake up?

13:55.835 --> 14:01.131
Oh, I never thought
a nightmare could smell so delicious.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.634
Robert, I came as soon as you called.

14:03.717 --> 14:07.638
I'm so sorry
about your unfortunate misfortune.

14:07.721 --> 14:10.558
Thank you, Lou. You're a good friend.

14:10.641 --> 14:14.728
And don't despair.
Your insurance will cover this.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.564
I don't have insurance.

14:16.647 --> 14:20.943
I spent the money on this chicken suit,
which I did insure.

14:21.652 --> 14:25.072
Then you should most definitely despair.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.740
That's why I called.

14:26.824 --> 14:31.287
Now that I'm ruined,
I won't be able to pay you what I owe you.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.038
I hate to disappoint you,

14:33.122 --> 14:37.084
but I'm afraid
we're gonna have to cancel our agreement.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.545
I hate to disappoint you,

Sweetie, hate is such a strong word.

15:01.233 --> 15:05.863
All Pop-Pop has done for the last 15 years
is reject his own flesh and blood.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.823
Uncle Louis is a pickle sniffer.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.074

-Ow!

He's not a pickle sniffer.
He's a song-and-dance man.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.662
And you shouldn't judge him.

then so be it.

with your jokes, you know.

-Too well.

It's such a blessing to spend
one last Thanksgiving with the old man.

I want to tell him how much I'll miss him.

that would blow the whole lie apart.

this whole thing playing out?

I was at a gay bar. I saw my old boss
getting his pickle sniffed.

16:40.541 --> 16:41.583
I had to think quick.

You have to help me keep them distracted
until the neighbors get here for dessert.

They hate me.

I'm going to miss when you're--

he's happy Nixon got a full pardon!

-I said what?

19:43.056 --> 19:45.893
I'll bet there's
a perfectly sensible reason

19:45.976 --> 19:48.187
why she's not answering the phone.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.147
What's that mean? You think
she got back together with Joel?

I'm sure whoever this Joel is,

he's not as handsome as you are.

What are you talking about?
He's a man! He was bar mitzvahed!

with anyone else.

-I'm not saying she's dead.

what Nguyen-Nguyen was gonna do.

where a Vietnamese woman
poisoned her husband.

that story.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.050
Your woman is fucking weird, man!

21:00.133 --> 21:01.260
[screams]

21:01.343 --> 21:06.014
For God's sake, Evelyn, move on!
We're never gonna have a kid!

21:06.098 --> 21:08.225
You're the one who can't face the truth!

21:08.308 --> 21:10.727
It wasn't clams!

21:10.811 --> 21:14.064
And I'm starting to think
you lied about Frank's pants!

21:14.147 --> 21:18.485
I stole his pants
because they made me feel alive, Ev!

21:18.568 --> 21:20.237
In a way you never do!

21:20.320 --> 21:22.447
-You all have a Happy Easter. Okay.
-[giggling]

21:22.531 --> 21:24.116
You don't take me dancing!

21:24.199 --> 21:27.536
And you've never once watched me
shit in the woods!

21:27.619 --> 21:29.454
A man has needs!

21:29.538 --> 21:33.000
This neighborhood was way more normal
when I was on the goofies.

21:34.167 --> 21:36.378
[man] Buster Thunder Junior
is ready to jump!

21:36.461 --> 21:37.629
Here he goes!

21:37.713 --> 21:41.883
Sue, this was lovely,
but we should be on our way.

21:41.967 --> 21:45.178
It's a four-hour drive,
and I'd like to have your father awake

21:45.262 --> 21:46.763
at James Dean Curve.

21:46.847 --> 21:49.349
Oh, please don't go,
but here's your coats!

21:50.017 --> 21:51.935
Thank you, angel.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.438
And thank you, Frank.

21:54.521 --> 21:57.149
The turkey was... competently sliced.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.568
And I know how hard
that must've been for you to say.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.863
-Good to see you, son.
-You too, Dad.

22:02.946 --> 22:04.948
[man on TV]
Buster just might pull this off!

22:05.032 --> 22:09.411
-Let's all do this again next year!
-Sue, how could you be so insensitive?

22:09.494 --> 22:11.747
-What?
-[man] Uh-oh, he's picked up a wobble.

22:11.830 --> 22:15.334
Do this again next year?
Where? On Dad's grave?

22:15.417 --> 22:16.501
My what?

22:16.585 --> 22:19.504
Sue told me, Dad. Told me you're dying.

22:19.588 --> 22:22.549
-You told him I was dying?
-[man] Buster is airborne!

22:22.632 --> 22:23.717
Not in those words.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.635
Exactly in those words!

22:25.719 --> 22:28.680
[man] And he crashes
into the concrete riverbank!

22:28.764 --> 22:30.098
[all gasp]

22:30.182 --> 22:34.061
He came so close and then shit-a the bed!

22:34.144 --> 22:35.437
Why would you lie to me?

22:35.520 --> 22:37.356
I wanted you and Dad to make up!

22:37.439 --> 22:38.940
You thought so little of us

22:39.024 --> 22:42.486
that we couldn't make up
without you putting a tumor in his brain?

22:42.569 --> 22:44.529
You said you didn't give a shit about him!

22:44.613 --> 22:47.866
-Well, that's real nice!
-Oh, as nice as disowning me, Dad?

22:47.949 --> 22:49.326
[Stan] You disowned yourself

22:49.409 --> 22:52.245
the minute you decided
to lust over other men!

22:52.329 --> 22:55.749
It's not lust, Dad. It's love.
I'm a human being!

22:55.832 --> 22:57.626
I'm just the way God made me.

22:57.709 --> 23:01.505
There you go,
always blaming somebody else!

23:03.715 --> 23:05.050
Alice!

23:05.133 --> 23:06.927
Alice! Come out, please!

23:07.010 --> 23:09.888
I'm here to prove to you
I can give you your space!

23:11.139 --> 23:13.642
-Oh, Alice!
-Kevin, what are you doing here?

23:13.725 --> 23:16.061
Where the hell have you been, young lady?

23:16.144 --> 23:18.814
We had Thanksgiving at my aunt's house.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.440
You believe in Thanksgiving?

23:20.524 --> 23:22.651
[pants] I thought you were Jewish.

23:22.734 --> 23:25.487
[chuckles]

23:25.570 --> 23:28.740
This is a story
we're gonna tell our grandkids. [chuckles]

23:28.824 --> 23:30.117
You're creeping me out.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.786
Am I creeping you out
down there? [chuckles]

23:33.286 --> 23:36.373
-Hey, Alice, is this kid bothering you?
-Is this that fucking Joel?

23:36.456 --> 23:37.666
No, Kevin, this is--

23:37.749 --> 23:39.084
-[Mrs. Goldman] Oh my God!
-[Dr. Goldman] Daniel!

23:39.167 --> 23:40.085
My brother!

23:40.168 --> 23:41.545
Ow, shit, my hand!

23:41.628 --> 23:42.963
You knocked out my tooth!

23:43.046 --> 23:44.840
[splutters] You can have one of mine.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.842
Kevin, get out of here!

23:46.925 --> 23:48.844
I never want to see you again!

23:48.927 --> 23:50.595
But it's Thanksgiving!

23:50.679 --> 23:53.723
[Louis] You have no idea
what it's like being your son!

23:53.807 --> 23:56.893
You have no idea
what it's like being your father!

23:56.977 --> 24:01.606
I had to bail you out of jail
for defiling that Greyhound station!

24:01.690 --> 24:04.526
Bus travel has lost all its class.

24:04.609 --> 24:05.610
Dad, stop!

24:05.694 --> 24:08.947
You shame Louis, but maybe
if his lifestyle was more accepted,

24:09.030 --> 24:11.533
he wouldn't have to do those things
in secret at the bus station.

24:11.616 --> 24:14.369
-Oh, Sue, I'd still go to the bus station.
-See?

24:14.453 --> 24:16.496
-The man's a deviant.
-And you're a bigot!

24:16.580 --> 24:19.374
Stan, come on. It's Thanksgiving.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.084
Louis is a good guy.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.587
Yeah, he's got a little sugar in his tank,
but you know...

24:23.670 --> 24:27.466
Sugar in the tank?
I could kick your ass across this room.

24:27.549 --> 24:30.135
-I was sticking up for you!
-Stay out of this.

24:30.218 --> 24:33.138
Like you should've stayed out
of my daughter 15 years ago.

24:33.221 --> 24:34.639
-Dad!
-He's right.

24:34.723 --> 24:38.768
Dad and I got along great until the day
you married this balding piece of shit.

24:38.852 --> 24:42.606
Eh, you know what?
You two can just go fuck off!

24:42.689 --> 24:45.650
Jesus Christ,
this woman worked herself to the bone

24:45.734 --> 24:47.319
to make this perfect day for you.

24:47.402 --> 24:50.030
And she asked me to help. Did I complain?

24:50.113 --> 24:51.698
A little at first.

24:51.781 --> 24:54.951
But then, I cut short
a very, very happy nap,

24:55.035 --> 24:56.244
one of those good ones

24:56.328 --> 24:58.914
where you're sleeping so peacefully
you feel like you're dead,

24:58.997 --> 25:00.874
you know, and you're thinking,
"Oh my God, it's finally over,"

25:00.957 --> 25:03.627
right, to drive my snotty kids
to the grocery store

25:03.710 --> 25:06.087
to get the fancy cranberries that I hate,

25:06.171 --> 25:08.423
just to help her
bring you two back together.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.841
And now I'm the bad guy?

25:09.925 --> 25:12.177
Well, fuck you and your fighting!

25:12.260 --> 25:14.012
Jesus Christ,
why don't you count your blessings?

25:14.095 --> 25:15.972
You're lucky your old man's still alive.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.850
Christ, what I wouldn't give
to hear my dad call me a "whiny bitch"

25:18.934 --> 25:20.018
just one more time!

25:20.101 --> 25:22.646
I'm happy to fill in, shit-bird!

25:22.729 --> 25:25.982
Oh, no, no, no,
I said "whiny bitch," you fuck!

25:26.066 --> 25:28.527
So fuck you, Stan! And fuck you, Louis!

25:28.610 --> 25:32.239
And, Marilyn, I really enjoyed
the story about the ducks.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.282
I hope that law passes
so the state doesn't kill 'em.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.451
-Aw.
-But fuck you!

25:36.535 --> 25:39.287
[groaning]

25:39.371 --> 25:41.081
[sad music playing]

25:45.168 --> 25:46.002
Ah!

25:46.086 --> 25:47.212
[tires squeal]

25:55.720 --> 25:57.973
[sobs]

25:58.056 --> 25:59.516
[babbling]

25:59.599 --> 26:02.102
Oh, you like Grandpa Bill's keys.

26:02.185 --> 26:03.937
Yeah.

26:04.020 --> 26:09.359
He was a miserable son of a bitch,
but his keys go jingle-jangle-jingle.

26:09.442 --> 26:11.444
[Sue chewing voraciously]

26:13.863 --> 26:15.282
-Hey, Sue.
-[baby laughs]

26:15.365 --> 26:17.867
Look, I'm sorry
that today went so badly for you.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.077
I can't talk now.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.955
I didn't eat anything all day.

26:22.038 --> 26:23.915
Hey, remember how you said
I was too obsessed

26:23.999 --> 26:27.627
with figuring out what my dad meant
when he said "box 16"?

26:27.711 --> 26:31.756
Well, I think this thing with Louis
is your version of that.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.676
And it's not good for you either. [scoffs]

26:34.759 --> 26:36.636
We're never gonna get what we want.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.096
You're right.

26:38.179 --> 26:39.848
I'm gonna go wolf down some cobbler

26:39.931 --> 26:43.351
and then pass out in the bathtub
with this thermos of mulled wine.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.562
You're on Megan duty.

26:47.939 --> 26:49.024
[laughing]

26:49.107 --> 26:50.984
Guess what, Megan?

26:51.067 --> 26:53.445
We never have to see Pop-Pop again

26:53.528 --> 26:55.488
'cause Mommy was nutty today.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.365
Yes, she was.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.451
[laughing] Ah!

27:00.577 --> 27:02.912
[Frank] Oh, you like that little one, huh?

27:05.332 --> 27:07.917
Oh my God. Sixteen.

27:10.378 --> 27:12.797
So much to be thankful for.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.507

27:14.591 --> 27:15.925
