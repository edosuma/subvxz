WEBVTT

00:07.655 --> 00:10.931
- What's reflected in a mirror
in a pitch-black room?

00:22.586 --> 00:24.965
- Once we remove it,
they can no longer listen.

00:25.068 --> 00:27.103
They can't track you.

00:27.206 --> 00:29.344
You'll be completely unplugged
from the system.

00:29.448 --> 00:31.793
Are you sure you're ready
to leave your old life behind?

00:31.896 --> 00:33.862
- The system is broken,

00:33.965 --> 00:36.586
and I've always felt like
an outsider looking in.

00:36.689 --> 00:38.344
- You're special.
- I've always felt special.

00:38.448 --> 00:41.034
- You're the most special person
in the universe.

00:41.137 --> 00:43.724
- I'm ready to accept
how special I am.

01:03.965 --> 01:06.862
I'm free.

01:06.965 --> 01:10.689
I'm fin--

01:10.793 --> 01:13.103
Finally free.

01:13.206 --> 01:14.793
- I can't believe you asked me
to drive you to work today

01:14.896 --> 01:17.206
just so you could watch
your pseudo-intellectual TV show

01:17.310 --> 01:18.931
on your stupid
oversized smart watch.

01:19.034 --> 01:20.517
It must be feel really great
for the filmmakers

01:20.620 --> 01:22.344
to know that their premium
high-budget TV show

01:22.448 --> 01:24.068
is being viewed
on a five-inch screen.

01:24.172 --> 01:25.068
Can you even hear me?
No.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.655
Great.
I'm talking to myself.

01:27.758 --> 01:29.448
"Oh, hi, me,
how are you doing?"

01:29.551 --> 01:31.241
"I'm doing terribly."
"Why?"

01:31.344 --> 01:32.862
"Because my friend thinks
I'm an Uber driver.

01:32.965 --> 01:35.379
"I'm also doing bad for reasons
totally unrelated to that,

01:35.482 --> 01:37.310
but thank you for asking."

01:37.413 --> 01:39.413
- How do I know
I can trust you?

01:39.517 --> 01:41.655
- You can't trust anyone,
not even yourself.

01:49.448 --> 01:54.172
-  Jake, you got
to watch this show.

01:56.655 --> 01:58.103
- Can we talk
about anything else?

01:58.206 --> 01:59.586
- Like what?

01:59.689 --> 02:02.620
- Do you think bin Laden's
widow is dating again?

02:02.724 --> 02:04.310
- I mean, I hope so.
She's a human being.

02:04.413 --> 02:05.793
She deserves love.

02:28.896 --> 02:30.931
It's crazy that Hampton DeVille
makes a smart watch

02:31.034 --> 02:34.137
almost identical to the one
in "Society Tomorrow."

02:34.241 --> 02:36.241
- No, Matt,
organized religion is crazy.

02:36.344 --> 02:38.379
The resurgence
of neo-Nazism is crazy.

02:38.482 --> 02:39.551
My mom is crazy.

02:39.655 --> 02:40.827
But the fact
that Hampton DeVille

02:40.931 --> 02:42.034
made an evil smart watch
and you bought it?

02:42.137 --> 02:44.310
Not crazy.

02:44.413 --> 02:46.034
- Eh, the GuardWrist is evil.

02:46.137 --> 02:47.482
The HD StrapIn is awesome.

02:47.586 --> 02:48.862
It acts as
my personal assistant,

02:48.965 --> 02:50.000
monitors my blood pressure,

02:50.103 --> 02:52.103
involuntarily,
but I know it's for my own good.

02:52.206 --> 02:54.586
It also records
how many steps I take.

02:54.689 --> 02:57.241
See, before, I didn't know
how many steps I took,

02:57.344 --> 02:59.689
but now I do, so that's good.

02:59.793 --> 03:02.241
- Wow. Yeah, steps.
That sounds incredible.

03:02.344 --> 03:03.689
- And it has
all my key card info on it,

03:03.793 --> 03:06.206
so I can beep right through
at work in two seconds.

03:06.310 --> 03:08.241
- Yeah, that definitely
seems much easier

03:08.344 --> 03:09.655
than just doing this.

03:09.758 --> 03:11.275
I totally see why you'd be
willing to share

03:11.379 --> 03:12.482
all of your
personal information

03:12.586 --> 03:14.448
for such a time-saving
convenience.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.551
- Are you watching
"Society Tomorrow"?

03:20.655 --> 03:21.862
- Yes.

03:21.965 --> 03:24.620
- I was up all last night
binge-watching it.

03:24.724 --> 03:26.103
I love it.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.551
It's the only good thing
in my life.

03:27.655 --> 03:31.379
My son is kind of not
talking to me right now.

03:31.482 --> 03:32.793
Real talk, though?

03:32.896 --> 03:36.068
I feel like Joshua's reflection
in the mirror

03:36.172 --> 03:36.965
is like a metaphor.

03:37.068 --> 03:38.827
- Yes.

03:38.931 --> 03:40.275
Just wait till you get
to episode four.

03:40.379 --> 03:41.241
It turns out--
- Oh, no spoilers.

03:41.344 --> 03:43.206
- Oh--
I'm sorry.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.482
Mm.

03:44.586 --> 03:46.344
I mean,
I think the show's an homage

03:46.448 --> 03:48.793
to a genre that
it's also reinventing.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.379
- Oh, and the music!

03:50.482 --> 03:52.827
Oh, I want to make love
to that soundtrack.

03:52.931 --> 03:54.068
- Oh, I know.

03:58.965 --> 04:00.379
- Don't get too friendly
with security guards.

04:00.482 --> 04:01.620
I once made the mistake

04:01.724 --> 04:03.137
of telling a security guard
to have a nice day.

04:03.241 --> 04:04.241
Next thing I knew,

04:04.344 --> 04:05.724
I was watching
his improv comedy troupe.

04:05.827 --> 04:06.896
- I actually did improv
in coll--

04:07.000 --> 04:07.896
- I know.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Small talk is dangerous.

04:09.103 --> 04:10.448
The idea is to have

04:10.551 --> 04:11.896
a superficial nod-and-walk
relationship with security.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.137
- I like Hubert.

04:13.241 --> 04:15.689
- Oh, my God,
you know his name.

04:15.793 --> 04:17.862
You're already in too deep.

04:17.965 --> 04:19.206
- What sets
"Society Tomorrow" apart

04:19.310 --> 04:20.137
is not just the storytelling,

04:20.241 --> 04:22.655
but also the cinematography.

04:22.758 --> 04:24.172
- Oh, the cinematography
is incredible.

04:24.275 --> 04:27.379
- I love cinnamon-tography.

04:27.482 --> 04:29.241
- All right, guys,
enough chitchat.

04:29.344 --> 04:30.758
Time to get to work.
- Thank God.

04:30.862 --> 04:35.206
- Now, there's a chance we may
need to lay off 10,000 people,

04:35.310 --> 04:37.275
but first on the agenda...

04:37.379 --> 04:38.620
"Society Tomorrow."

04:38.724 --> 04:40.655
- Yeah! Yep!
- Wow!

04:40.758 --> 04:42.241
- What a show. What a show.
- Oh, my God.

04:42.344 --> 04:43.724
I am, like, full-on obsessed
with that.

04:43.827 --> 04:44.931
- Same.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.241
- Although,
I certainly hope the GuardWrist

04:47.344 --> 04:50.172
doesn't make people think the HD
StrapIn can control their minds.

04:50.275 --> 04:51.724
- Right?

04:51.827 --> 04:54.758
Although, the HD StrapIn's
targeted advertising

04:54.862 --> 04:57.241
could be considered a low-grade
form of mind control.

04:57.344 --> 05:00.137
all: Ooh.

05:00.241 --> 05:03.655
- I'm sorry, did you guys say
something about layoffs?

05:03.758 --> 05:07.103
- Um, Jake?
We're on an agenda here.

05:07.206 --> 05:08.827
Right now we're discussing
the groundbreaking

05:08.931 --> 05:10.448
original streaming series
"Society Tomorrow."

05:10.551 --> 05:12.275
Do you have any thoughts
on that topic?

05:12.379 --> 05:13.517
- No, I haven't watched it.

05:13.620 --> 05:15.482
I'm not really a sci-fi
fantasy binge-watch

05:15.586 --> 05:18.000
brainwashed-by-pop-culture
type of person.

05:18.103 --> 05:19.793
-  I am so totally
jealous of you.

05:19.896 --> 05:22.379
I wish I could go back
and watch it for the first time.

05:22.482 --> 05:24.275
- That's a great idea.
Amazing thought.

05:24.379 --> 05:25.827
Amazing thought.
- Wow.

05:25.931 --> 05:28.517
- You should probably sit the
rest of this meeting out, bud.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.103
It's gonna be
chock-full of spoilers.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.931
- Oh, it's okay.
I don't care about spoilers.

05:34.896 --> 05:35.965
Hey, champ,

05:36.068 --> 05:37.275
I wouldn't be able to live
with myself

05:37.379 --> 05:39.965
if I let the twists and turns
of "Society Tomorrow"

05:40.068 --> 05:40.965
be spoiled for you.

05:41.068 --> 05:42.000
That would just be
bad management.

05:42.103 --> 05:44.068
- But--
- Take the rest of the day,

05:44.172 --> 05:45.482
go watch the show,

05:45.586 --> 05:47.896
and come back here tomorrow
as a team player

05:48.000 --> 05:50.137
who can be part of
the national conversation.

05:50.241 --> 05:51.241
Mm-mm. Shh.

05:51.344 --> 05:53.655
- Does anyone else feel like

05:53.758 --> 05:55.413
Josh's reflection in the mirror
was a metaphor?

05:55.517 --> 05:58.586
- Definitely.
both: Absolutely.

05:58.689 --> 06:01.413
- And that should--

06:01.517 --> 06:03.482
No? Okay.

06:05.034 --> 06:08.448
- You know, I could remove
those advertisements for ya.

06:08.551 --> 06:09.862
- You can?
- Oh, yeah.

06:09.965 --> 06:11.413
Simple hack--
removes ads,

06:11.517 --> 06:14.344
allows me to install third-party
non-Hampton DeVille apps.

06:14.448 --> 06:16.586
- Like pornography?
-  Yeah.

06:16.689 --> 06:18.620
I'm sure the pornography
companies would appreciate

06:18.724 --> 06:20.034
their high-budget premium porn

06:20.137 --> 06:22.689
being viewed
on a five-inch screen.

06:22.793 --> 06:24.482
But, yeah,
I can access pornography.

06:24.586 --> 06:27.517
- Okay, well, yes.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.034
Did you guys take
that online quiz to find out

06:29.137 --> 06:30.482
what "Society Tomorrow"
character you are?

06:30.586 --> 06:31.586
- I got Barbara.

06:31.689 --> 06:33.000
- I got Joshua.

06:33.103 --> 06:35.034
- I got unnamed hyper-sexualized
female character.

06:35.137 --> 06:37.034
- Did you guys see there was
another mass shooting?

06:37.137 --> 06:38.137
14 casualties this time.

06:38.241 --> 06:39.000
This country has
such a huge problem with--

06:39.103 --> 06:40.551
- Jake? Come on.

06:40.655 --> 06:44.000
We're trying to talk
about a popular TV show.

06:44.103 --> 06:45.034
Have some respect.

06:45.137 --> 06:46.275
- You know what character
Jake would get

06:46.379 --> 06:47.655
if he took the quiz?

06:47.758 --> 06:48.862
- Glen.
- Oh!

06:48.965 --> 06:49.931
- Yes, Jake is such a Glen.

06:50.034 --> 06:52.034
- Who's Glen?
- You's Glen.

06:52.137 --> 06:53.379
- You know what? I don't care.
I'm gonna go sit somewhere else.

06:53.482 --> 06:55.517
- Oh, no, Glen!

06:55.620 --> 06:57.137
- I don't know
who this Glen character is,

06:57.241 --> 06:58.103
but I am not him.

06:58.206 --> 06:59.689
- Glen...
- Bye, Glen.

06:59.793 --> 07:00.931
Glen, come back.
- Glen, please come back.

07:01.034 --> 07:03.586
- I love you, Glen.
- I love "Society Tomorrow."

07:03.689 --> 07:05.586
- It's like an allegory
for the modern world.

07:05.689 --> 07:07.241
- Oh, the cinematography...

07:07.344 --> 07:08.379
- Is this the Glen...?

07:08.482 --> 07:09.586
- I read a think piece about it,

07:09.689 --> 07:11.103
so now I know
what to think about it.

07:13.379 --> 07:14.310
- Yeah, I stream it through
my parents' account.

07:14.413 --> 07:17.241
- The soundtrack is so amazing.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.103
Don't even ask
if I've seen the show.

07:20.206 --> 07:21.379
- Hell, no.

07:21.482 --> 07:24.896
I'm not watching that futuristic
nostalgia bullshit.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.413
I am re-watching all of
"Seinfeld" for the ninth time.

07:27.517 --> 07:29.586
It doesn't make me laugh
anymore, but it's comfortable,

07:29.689 --> 07:30.551
like an old sweatshirt.

07:30.655 --> 07:32.551
-  Thank God for you.

07:32.655 --> 07:33.724
You're the only person
I can talk to anymore.

07:33.827 --> 07:36.103
- Do you know I'm actually
getting HR complaints

07:36.206 --> 07:37.448
about spoilers?

07:37.551 --> 07:40.517
I just got out of a meeting
with a weeping 56-year-old man

07:40.620 --> 07:41.965
because someone spoiled
episode four.

07:42.068 --> 07:44.724
- This show is creating
a false sense of camaraderie,

07:44.827 --> 07:46.172
like when a celebrity dies.

07:46.275 --> 07:48.413
- You want to just talk about
the most recent mass shooting?

07:48.517 --> 07:50.689
- I would love to.

07:50.793 --> 07:53.068
- I always like when there's
more than one mass shooter,

07:53.172 --> 07:54.793
because then even after
they caught one,

07:54.896 --> 07:56.413
one is still at large,

07:56.517 --> 07:58.413
and people are still paralyzed
with fear.

07:58.517 --> 07:59.758
- It's way more fun
that way, yeah,

07:59.862 --> 08:02.620
'cause the news cycle
keeps going.

08:02.724 --> 08:04.344
- Is it just me,
or does the HD StrapIn

08:04.448 --> 08:07.517
emit a tiny electrical shock
every time an ad pops up?

08:07.620 --> 08:08.896
- You can turn that off
in settings,

08:09.000 --> 08:10.103
but they make it
really hard to find,

08:10.206 --> 08:13.896
like Waldo or the clitoris
or Waldo's clitoris.

08:15.379 --> 08:16.689
Great joke, Baron.

08:16.793 --> 08:20.586
But don't worry. When I'm done,
you'll be all set.

08:22.413 --> 08:24.172
Oh, damn.

08:24.275 --> 08:28.034
Uh, had you updated this
to HD OS 10.3 yet?

08:28.137 --> 08:30.482
- No.

08:30.586 --> 08:32.275
- Okay, good.
Then this is not my fault.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.758
Um, just call tech support,

08:34.862 --> 08:37.206
and they'll do a password reset,
and you'll be all good.

08:37.310 --> 08:39.517
- It feels like
it's locked to my wrist.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.896
- It is.

08:47.137 --> 08:48.862
- I've uncovered the truth
about the GuardWrist.

08:48.965 --> 08:50.758
I'm going to expose you.

08:50.862 --> 08:53.482
- I don't you think
you will, Barbara.

08:55.482 --> 08:58.655
- It's locked to my arm.

08:58.758 --> 09:00.034
I can't control!

09:00.137 --> 09:01.931
No! No!

09:02.034 --> 09:03.275
Not in my mouth!

09:03.379 --> 09:04.137
- Bye-bye, Barbara.

09:13.310 --> 09:14.724
- This is it.
I'm in the system now.

09:14.827 --> 09:18.344
I'm a prisoner to the StrapIn,
and there's no going back.

09:18.448 --> 09:19.862
Bin Laden...

09:19.965 --> 09:21.793
Why didn't I just think
about bin Laden?

09:21.896 --> 09:22.827
Wonder what he's doing
right now.

09:22.931 --> 09:25.793
Oh, that's right,
we killed him.

09:25.896 --> 09:28.310
He's dead.
Wow, that's wild.

09:28.413 --> 09:30.379
I wonder if bin Laden
would've liked me.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.862
I mean, I'm an American,

09:31.965 --> 09:33.620
but maybe he would've seen
through that.

09:33.724 --> 09:34.689
It's physically locked
to my wrist.

09:34.793 --> 09:37.241
Can't we just do
a password reset?

09:37.344 --> 09:38.551
- How did I become
Matt's chauffeur again?

09:38.655 --> 09:41.655
When did this happen?
How did the power dynamic shift?

09:41.758 --> 09:43.655
- What? I don't know
when I first fantasized

09:43.758 --> 09:44.931
about my parents having sex.

09:45.034 --> 09:46.310
How is that
a security question?

09:46.413 --> 09:47.827
- I'm sorry, sir,

09:47.931 --> 09:49.827
but there's a lot of personal
information on your StrapIn--

09:49.931 --> 09:50.965
home address, complete map
of your human genome.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.482
- Look, I was just getting
kind of annoyed

09:52.586 --> 09:55.103
by the targeted advertising,
so I had a friend unharness it.

09:55.206 --> 09:56.793
- Sir, that voids
the warranty.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.620
I will no longer
be able to assist you.

09:58.724 --> 10:00.000
- No, listen,
you have to help me.

10:00.103 --> 10:01.482
I don't know if you watch
"Society Tomorrow,"

10:01.586 --> 10:02.758
but I just got to the episode

10:02.862 --> 10:04.241
where the GuardWrist
makes Barbara kill herself.

10:04.344 --> 10:05.793
- Wait, wait, wait! No, I
haven't seen that episode yet!

10:05.896 --> 10:07.724
Fuck you, asshole.
I'm terminating this call.

10:07.827 --> 10:08.862
- Hello?
Hello?

10:08.965 --> 10:10.724
- I'll drive us
both off the road.

10:10.827 --> 10:11.620
I don't care.
I'm a nihilist.

10:11.724 --> 10:13.758
- They hung up on me.

10:18.413 --> 10:21.896
In the modern world,
technology is inescapable.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.413
People spend all day
at their computers.

10:24.517 --> 10:27.379
Life today is just
one big video game.

10:27.482 --> 10:30.931
The pixels on their screens
make them feel joy, sadness,

10:31.034 --> 10:32.655
other emotions
I can't think of right now.

10:32.758 --> 10:35.620
- Whoa, Matt.
Whoa, you almost ran into me.

10:35.724 --> 10:37.241
- Oh, sorry.
I was just thinking about--

10:37.344 --> 10:38.931
- "Society Tomorrow"?

10:39.034 --> 10:41.379
God, it really gets
in your head, doesn't it?

10:41.482 --> 10:43.793
- Yeah. I just got to
the episode last night

10:43.896 --> 10:45.793
where the GuardWrist
makes Barbara kill herself.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.344
- Fuck!

10:47.448 --> 10:51.413
- It sounds like there was
a momentary lapse in judgment,

10:51.517 --> 10:55.896
and a mistake was made.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.896
So I think all we need
is an apology.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.862
- I'm sorry I spoiled
an episode for you.

11:08.965 --> 11:11.448
I accept your apology.

11:11.551 --> 11:12.724
- That's nice.

11:12.827 --> 11:15.034
- No!
Not in my mouth!

11:15.137 --> 11:16.241
- Hey, John?
- Yes.

11:16.344 --> 11:17.344
- I actually took
some initiative

11:17.448 --> 11:19.034
and investigated
the cause of the layoffs,

11:19.137 --> 11:20.344
and I think I found a way
to save thousands of jobs.

11:20.448 --> 11:23.620
- Wow. Jake...

11:23.724 --> 11:25.000
how did you have time
to do this

11:25.103 --> 11:26.758
and also watch
"Society Tomorrow"?

11:26.862 --> 11:29.206
- Oh, yeah, I--
I didn't watch it.

11:32.896 --> 11:35.586
- Jake, I specifically
instructed you

11:35.689 --> 11:37.103
to watch "Society Tomorrow."

11:37.206 --> 11:39.068
- I know.

11:39.172 --> 11:40.448
I just thought this was
more important.

11:40.551 --> 11:44.758
- Forget everything
you think is important.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.931
There is a storm coming,

11:49.034 --> 11:52.344
and when it comes,
none of us will be safe,

11:52.448 --> 11:55.620
least of all you.

11:57.172 --> 11:58.758
That's a line
from episode three.

11:58.862 --> 12:02.827
Dude, you got to watch.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.172
But also,
there are going to be layoffs,

12:05.275 --> 12:08.517
so that line does kind of
apply to you. Hmm.

12:08.620 --> 12:11.275
- And she was like, "No! No!
Not in my mouth!

12:11.379 --> 12:12.275
Blah!

12:14.862 --> 12:15.862
Oops.

12:17.724 --> 12:18.793
And then there was just, like,

12:18.896 --> 12:21.241
blood and guts,
like, everywhere.

12:21.344 --> 12:22.931
- Grace, I need to file
a formal complaint.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.586
- No! Not in my mouth!

12:24.689 --> 12:27.103
No.
- I'm sorry, Jake.

12:27.206 --> 12:30.689
The cinematography
was just so... cinematic.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.137
- I thought
I could trust you!

12:33.241 --> 12:34.379
- The GuardWrist
is listening to us.

12:34.482 --> 12:37.586
It knows that
we're plotting against it!

12:37.689 --> 12:38.896
- No, please.
You don't have to do this.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.172
- I have to get
this thing off of me!

12:41.275 --> 12:43.172
Because corporations!

12:43.275 --> 12:45.965
- No!

12:57.793 --> 13:00.241
- Glen?
What happened to you?

13:00.344 --> 13:01.965
- If you're gonna
keep watching this show,

13:02.068 --> 13:04.068
I am not giving you
a ride to work tomorrow.

13:04.172 --> 13:06.379
And I was planning
on stopping for doughnuts!

13:06.482 --> 13:08.310
And I am not Glen!

13:08.413 --> 13:11.034
- Hey, do you know
who you remind me of?

13:11.137 --> 13:12.965
Glen from "Society Tomorrow."

13:13.068 --> 13:14.862
Anyone ever tell you that?

13:14.965 --> 13:16.896
- Let me make myself
perfectly clear.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.896
I am not a part
of this pop-culture phenomenon.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.655
Our relationship
is supposed to be easy.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.965
We nod at each other,
and move on with our lives.

13:23.068 --> 13:24.896
We aren't friends.
We don't know each other.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.689
Watch your stupid show
and let me live my life.

13:27.793 --> 13:30.689
Ow!
- Are you okay?

13:30.793 --> 13:32.758
- I banged my knee.
Who cares?

13:32.862 --> 13:33.862
- I do.

13:33.965 --> 13:36.931
- It doesn't matter
what we do.

13:37.034 --> 13:37.931
Nothing matters!

13:38.034 --> 13:41.862
They are always going to win.

13:41.965 --> 13:43.655
I'm a nihilist.
Don't you get that?

13:43.758 --> 13:45.586
- It's not worth it, Glen.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.137
- I have to know the truth.

13:53.241 --> 13:56.620
Is this technology
secretly controlling me,

13:56.724 --> 13:59.896
or am I letting a fictional
TV show make me paranoid?

14:06.344 --> 14:07.896
- The only way
to stop the GuardWrist

14:08.000 --> 14:10.310
is by getting to the source.

14:10.413 --> 14:13.310
We need to find the source,

14:13.413 --> 14:15.379
so we can stop the GuardWrist.

14:19.482 --> 14:21.413
- I was searching the world
for answers,

14:21.517 --> 14:24.724
when all along, the source
was right under my nose.

14:24.827 --> 14:27.275
I'm wearing an oven mitt.

14:33.862 --> 14:36.689
- Oh, hey. Matt.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.034
Still fighting
the resistance?

14:38.137 --> 14:38.965
You know it.

14:39.068 --> 14:41.034
You want to hear
something funny?

14:41.137 --> 14:43.758
My HD StrapIn is actually
locked to my wrist.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.793
You know, my improv group did
a scene about that last night.

14:48.896 --> 14:52.275
- You do improv?
- Yes, and!

14:52.379 --> 14:53.827
You should come see us
sometime.

14:53.931 --> 14:55.965
Yeah, sure, Hubert.

14:56.068 --> 14:58.344
Anyway, I'm actually having
a lot of trouble

14:58.448 --> 15:00.448
getting tech support
to help me out with this.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.724
I hear the labs
where they design it

15:02.827 --> 15:04.448
are somewhere
in the building.

15:04.551 --> 15:06.000
- The labs...

15:06.103 --> 15:09.241
Oh, they're on level B3,
underground.

15:09.344 --> 15:13.034
I'm really not authorized
to give you clearance...

15:14.620 --> 15:16.931
But anything
for my buddy Matt.

15:17.034 --> 15:18.862
- Thanks, Hubert.

15:18.965 --> 15:20.517
- Sure.

15:25.137 --> 15:27.206
Hey, man,
I forgot my key card at home.

15:27.310 --> 15:28.793
- I can't let you into
the building without a card.

15:28.896 --> 15:30.137
- Yeah, but you know
I work here.

15:30.241 --> 15:32.172
- We don't really know
each other.

15:32.275 --> 15:34.482
-  Okay, fine,
you can have a doughnut.

15:34.586 --> 15:36.068
I mostly bought them
out of spite, anyway.

15:36.172 --> 15:37.310
- I'm gluten-free.

15:37.413 --> 15:38.586
If we knew each other,
you'd know that.

15:38.689 --> 15:39.551
- You know who I am.
I don't have time for this.

15:39.655 --> 15:41.517
- Sir, stop!

15:41.620 --> 15:43.137
Security!
Someone's breaking through.

15:50.000 --> 15:50.827
- Uncovering the truth--

15:50.931 --> 15:53.000
that's what this is about.

15:53.103 --> 15:54.862
It's me against the world.

15:54.965 --> 15:58.413
Me against the world.

16:00.275 --> 16:02.206
This is not
the position I chose,

16:02.310 --> 16:03.965
but this is the world
I live in.

16:04.068 --> 16:05.413
I'm special,

16:05.517 --> 16:06.896
and I'm taking control back
with the truth.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.655
- What are you doing
down here?

16:09.758 --> 16:12.689
- Uh, I was, just, uh,

16:12.793 --> 16:15.103
going for a walk.

16:15.206 --> 16:17.517
- Are you one of those guys
that drinks the pee?

16:17.620 --> 16:19.793
- Uh, no?

16:21.034 --> 16:22.689
Who are you?

16:22.793 --> 16:24.896
- I'm Jake Levinson.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.137
I'm a Junior Executive
In Training.

16:26.241 --> 16:28.379
- Where is
your identification?

16:28.482 --> 16:30.517
- I left it at home
with my key card and wallet.

16:30.620 --> 16:32.724
I might have adult ADHD,
but I'm too afraid

16:32.827 --> 16:34.827
to go to a doctor to get
officially diagnosed, okay?

16:34.931 --> 16:36.241
- I know who you are.

16:36.344 --> 16:38.758
You're just another
"Society Tomorrow" super-fan.

16:38.862 --> 16:40.827
- I am nota super-fan.

16:40.931 --> 16:43.379
I haven't even seen
one episode of that dumb show.

16:43.482 --> 16:44.827
- To confirm your identity,

16:44.931 --> 16:48.413
we're gonna have to ask you
some security questions.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.448
- The secret to great coffee

16:57.551 --> 16:59.379
is getting your beans
straight from the source.

16:59.482 --> 17:02.793
- She seems nice,
but she's part of the system.

17:02.896 --> 17:06.137
Systems are bad,
so she must be bad.

17:06.241 --> 17:08.103
But I'm part of the system.
Am I bad?

17:08.206 --> 17:09.413
No, I'm good.

17:09.517 --> 17:11.137
Should I drink it?
What if it's poisoned?

17:11.241 --> 17:12.586
What does poison smell like?

17:12.689 --> 17:14.103
Does poison smell like coffee?
Bin Laden.

17:14.206 --> 17:17.034
- Okay,
so once we remove the StrapIn,

17:17.137 --> 17:18.931
you'll be able to reset
your password.

17:19.034 --> 17:21.241
Are you ready?
- Yeah.

17:26.965 --> 17:28.103
- There you go.

17:28.206 --> 17:30.310
- Oh, God, thank you.

17:30.413 --> 17:32.551
- Yeah, congratulations.

17:32.655 --> 17:33.758
- If you want,
I can program it

17:33.862 --> 17:36.620
to make you shoot yourself
in front of your family.

17:38.620 --> 17:40.206
Bam!

17:40.310 --> 17:41.137
No!

17:43.172 --> 17:44.551
Why?

17:44.655 --> 17:45.448
No, no, no,
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

17:45.551 --> 17:48.448
I'm just kidding.

17:48.551 --> 17:51.310
Oh, that show is
so over the top.

17:51.413 --> 17:53.000
- Yeah,
but the cinnamon-tography.

17:53.103 --> 17:56.068
- Oh, fuck
the cinematography.

17:56.172 --> 17:58.413
In real life,
there's no diabolical CEO

17:58.517 --> 18:00.137
with a plan to destroy
the world,

18:00.241 --> 18:01.310
not even Christian DeVille.

18:01.413 --> 18:04.793
Basic ineptitude
and people trying their best

18:04.896 --> 18:08.275
is what leads to the daily
horror humans deal with.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.344
- Well, thank you.
This is such a relief.

18:10.448 --> 18:12.793
- You're welcome.
Hey, stop by the lab anytime.

18:12.896 --> 18:14.758
We have a lot of fun down here.

18:14.862 --> 18:16.793
And I don't talk
to a lot of, uh, people,

18:16.896 --> 18:21.137
so this meant a lot to me.

18:21.241 --> 18:23.413
- Uh, okay.

18:23.517 --> 18:24.758
- I don't remember
the first time

18:24.862 --> 18:26.379
I got an erection
watching gymnastics, okay?

18:26.482 --> 18:29.551
How many more questions
are you going to ask me?

18:29.655 --> 18:30.758
- Just one,

18:30.862 --> 18:33.034
but you're going to
have to tell the truth.

18:33.137 --> 18:35.275
What's the real reason

18:35.379 --> 18:38.034
you haven't watched
"Society Tomorrow"?

18:38.137 --> 18:40.103
- Because I like
being contrarian.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.655
It's an easy way
to get attention, okay?

18:42.758 --> 18:46.034
The reality is I do want
to watch the dumb show.

18:46.137 --> 18:48.172
The cinematography
sounds incredible.

18:48.275 --> 18:49.448
But the more people
talked about it,

18:49.551 --> 18:50.862
the more annoying it got.

18:50.965 --> 18:53.551
Also, my ex-girlfriend
was super into sci-fi,

18:53.655 --> 18:55.275
and it makes me sad
to think about her,

18:55.379 --> 18:57.344
even though sometimes
I still watch porn

18:57.448 --> 18:59.034
with women who look
a lot like her.

18:59.137 --> 19:01.827
- Wow, he cracked fast.

19:01.931 --> 19:04.379
I've never seen
a more mentally weak man.

19:04.482 --> 19:06.103
- And at first, the Glen stuff
really pissed me off,

19:06.206 --> 19:08.310
but then I saw
a picture of the actor,

19:08.413 --> 19:09.655
and he's so hot.

19:09.758 --> 19:11.000
- I'm gonna record
some of this

19:11.103 --> 19:12.931
to use against him
whenever he's being annoying.

19:13.034 --> 19:16.448
- Hmm.

19:16.551 --> 19:17.931
- We will let you go

19:18.034 --> 19:21.379
after you sing the song
"Summer Nights" from "Grease,"

19:21.482 --> 19:23.344
both the girl and boy parts.

19:23.448 --> 19:24.758
♪ S--

19:27.000 --> 19:28.931
- So is the StrapIn
still stuck to your wrist?

19:29.034 --> 19:31.310
- No, I got it off,
but then I put it back on.

19:31.413 --> 19:32.482
I feel stupid
for how paranoid I got.

19:32.586 --> 19:34.275
I actually thought
they were listening to me.

19:34.379 --> 19:35.655
What are you doing
this weekend?

19:35.758 --> 19:37.206
- Probably gonna log into
my ex-girlfriend's account,

19:37.310 --> 19:39.482
binge-watch
"Society Tomorrow,"

19:39.586 --> 19:41.965
and give up on my attempts
to be a unique individual.

19:42.068 --> 19:44.724
- I decided that show is
a little overrated,

19:44.827 --> 19:46.862
but it does have
great cinnamon-tography.

19:46.965 --> 19:48.793
- What did you just say?

19:48.896 --> 19:50.379
- It has great
cinnamon-tography.

19:50.482 --> 19:51.724
- It's cinematography.

19:51.827 --> 19:53.000
Have you been saying
"cinnamon-tography"

19:53.103 --> 19:54.000
your whole life?

19:54.103 --> 19:55.379
- Cinnamon-tography.

19:55.482 --> 19:56.896
- Cinematography.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.551
- Shit.
- I'll catch up with you later.

19:58.655 --> 19:59.827
- God.

19:59.931 --> 20:02.655
- God is a kid
in a candy store, and Satan...

20:02.758 --> 20:06.137
- Hey, I'm sorry I haven't been
acknowledging you as a person.

20:06.241 --> 20:08.448
That's okay.

20:08.551 --> 20:09.689
I understand what it's like

20:09.793 --> 20:11.862
to be left out
of a cultural phenomenon.

20:11.965 --> 20:14.068
I could never get
into "Game of Thrones."

20:14.172 --> 20:16.551
The nudity felt gratuitous.

20:16.655 --> 20:17.896
- I like true-crime stuff.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Have you seen that TV show

20:19.103 --> 20:19.896
about Richard Ramirez,
"The Night Stalker"?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.344
- Yes, I have.

20:21.448 --> 20:24.241
Real-life atrocities
are my guilty pleasure.

20:24.344 --> 20:25.827
- Great.

20:25.931 --> 20:26.965
Every morning we'll have
a 20- to 30-second conversation

20:27.068 --> 20:27.965
about "The Night Stalker."

20:28.068 --> 20:30.448
- Oh, that sounds nice.

20:30.551 --> 20:32.689
Say, did you see last night

20:32.793 --> 20:34.482
when he shot that old woman
in the face?

20:34.586 --> 20:38.413
- Yeah, I loved it.
- Yeah, you know, I did, too.

20:38.517 --> 20:39.689
I didn't want to love it,
but I did.

20:39.793 --> 20:42.103
- Listen, he's compelling.
What am I gonna say?

20:42.206 --> 20:44.241
- He's incredibly compelling.

20:44.344 --> 20:47.068
- Huh, 5,000 steps.
Pretty good day.

21:10.931 --> 21:13.000
- I just got to the episode
last night where the GuardWrist

21:13.103 --> 21:14.275
makes Barbara kill herself.
- Fuck!

21:14.379 --> 21:16.379
- Kill herself.
- Fuck!

21:16.482 --> 21:17.448
Fuck!

21:17.551 --> 21:19.517
Fuck!
Fuck!

21:19.620 --> 21:20.724
- We're set.
Let's do it once more.

21:20.827 --> 21:22.241
- I think I can do
about one more of those.

21:24.000 --> 21:24.862
Fuck!
Fuck!
