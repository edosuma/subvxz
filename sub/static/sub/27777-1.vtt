01:19.365 --> 01:22.403
What do you
think we'll find, Dad?

01:22.405 --> 01:25.283
Will it be treasure,
will it be gold,

01:25.285 --> 01:28.322
or will there be a nasty trap?

01:28.324 --> 01:30.882
I'm not really keen on
traps, they can hurt.

01:30.884 --> 01:33.962
Especially the one that'll
slice your whole head off.

01:33.964 --> 01:35.682
I wouldn't like that.

01:35.684 --> 01:38.403
Wouldn't be able to eat my
dinner if I didn't have a mouth.

01:38.405 --> 01:39.843
Or any sweets.

01:39.845 --> 01:43.203
No, a beheading
wouldn't be great.

01:43.205 --> 01:45.563
It's a little fuzzy,
looks very orange.

01:45.565 --> 01:46.522
That's heat haze.

01:46.524 --> 01:49.003
Gonna be a beautiful evening.

01:49.005 --> 01:51.763
I dunno, the sun looks weird.

01:51.765 --> 01:53.203
More like a danger signal.

01:53.205 --> 01:55.363
I think it's a portent.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.642
10 year olds don't
talk about portents.

01:57.644 --> 01:58.804
This one does.

02:01.164 --> 02:02.803
- Dad.
- Uh huh?

02:02.805 --> 02:05.723
Do you think
we might a unicorn skeleton?

02:05.725 --> 02:07.162
Maybe, yeah.

02:07.164 --> 02:10.442
- Where?
- Underneath the big oak tree.

02:10.443 --> 02:13.843
- What color will it be?
- What, the oak tree?

02:13.845 --> 02:15.482
No, the skeleton.

02:15.484 --> 02:17.922
Oh, well they're
purple, aren't they?

02:17.924 --> 02:22.843
Mostly, but the skeleton,
I reckon it's gonna be silver.

02:22.845 --> 02:25.162
No, they're pink.

02:25.164 --> 02:26.803
Well if you
knew why did you ask?

02:26.805 --> 02:29.165
Well I wanted to test you.

02:41.444 --> 02:42.523
Any treasure yet?

02:42.525 --> 02:44.164
No just some worms.

02:46.125 --> 02:47.843
Three snails and
couple of rusty nails

02:47.845 --> 02:49.922
and Jesus's cross

02:49.924 --> 02:51.482
Let's have a look.

02:51.484 --> 02:54.644
Ah, almost definitely
2,000 years old.

02:56.005 --> 02:59.123
Look you can see the raven
nail maker's hallmark.

02:59.125 --> 03:00.642
Well done good find.

03:00.644 --> 03:03.922
Yeah well, still
no real treasure.

03:03.924 --> 03:05.843
I can't understand it.

03:05.845 --> 03:09.963
The map clearly says
the big triple tree.

03:09.965 --> 03:12.205
Right, three steps forward.

03:14.364 --> 03:16.725
- What does X mark?
- The spot.

03:32.884 --> 03:36.963
Thank you, I love you Dad,
it's the best treasure ever.

03:36.965 --> 03:38.925
Come on, getting dark.

03:42.085 --> 03:43.403
It's quite scary

03:43.405 --> 03:44.723
when the sun goes
down isn't it Dad?

03:44.725 --> 03:47.243
I'm not your dad!

03:47.245 --> 03:50.963
Eternity, wait come back,
I was only joking.

03:50.965 --> 03:53.765
Eternity wait up, come on.

03:57.845 --> 03:59.365
- Dad.
- Yeah?

03:59.924 --> 04:02.403
Sometimes
when I get scared I burp.

04:03.685 --> 04:05.083
Well you
gotta be careful

04:05.085 --> 04:07.002
'cause some monsters they
like the smell of burps

04:07.004 --> 04:09.643
and they'll come and eat you up.

04:09.645 --> 04:11.883
I'm not
scared of monsters.

04:15.004 --> 04:15.964
Okay.

04:18.684 --> 04:22.124
I wish Mom could've been a
treasure hunter with us today.

04:26.804 --> 04:29.122
I'm going to bed, don't
forget to brush your teeth.

04:29.124 --> 04:32.004
- Goodnight treasure hunter.
- Goodnight.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.443
What's the matter?

04:54.445 --> 04:57.125
There's a monster
under my bed.

05:01.044 --> 05:03.205
There's a monster on my bed.

05:16.085 --> 05:17.723
Eternity!

05:17.725 --> 05:19.042
You okay?

05:19.044 --> 05:22.004
There's a
monster under my bed.

05:32.965 --> 05:34.924
There's nothing there.

05:38.684 --> 05:39.845
He's coming.

05:58.004 --> 05:58.964
Help!

06:00.525 --> 06:01.602
Jack.

06:10.085 --> 06:11.883
I truly miss you.

06:57.604 --> 07:00.044
Please just get out of my head.

07:29.244 --> 07:30.204
No.

07:34.325 --> 07:36.682
- Jack.
- Mary.

07:36.684 --> 07:38.763
You all right Jack?

07:38.765 --> 07:40.122
You look a bit pooped.

07:40.124 --> 07:41.523
I'm at a loss.

07:41.525 --> 07:46.044
Oh yeah, filling the day
can be hard.

07:48.205 --> 07:50.083
Did you know that
the horse chestnut

07:50.085 --> 07:52.122
will soon be gone from
the English countryside

07:52.124 --> 07:54.404
within a couple of decades.

07:54.965 --> 07:59.765
First the elm, then the ash
and now the humble conker.

08:00.205 --> 08:04.885
"The woods decay,
the woods decay and fall."

08:05.405 --> 08:09.285
Oh my we are in a
blue funk aren't we?

08:09.525 --> 08:11.685
It's Tennyson, the poet.

08:12.885 --> 08:16.845
So how's Eternity,
how are you holding up?

08:17.205 --> 08:19.365
You know I've been better.

08:19.725 --> 08:24.282
I keep having these nightmares
and they feel so real

08:24.284 --> 08:25.683
I don't know whether
I'm awake or...

08:25.685 --> 08:28.043
Well sometimes when we
have a traumatic experience

08:28.045 --> 08:30.723
our perception can change.

08:30.725 --> 08:33.565
I just need
to keep busy you know.

08:34.004 --> 08:36.445
Been trying to find work
but there's nothing.

08:36.764 --> 08:38.881
I just need a new project.

08:38.884 --> 08:41.244
But you're a writer right?

08:43.085 --> 08:44.803
So what are you writing then?

08:44.805 --> 08:46.563
Stuff people
don't want to read.

08:46.565 --> 08:49.362
- Got an agent?
- Yeah.

08:49.364 --> 08:51.083
So why aren't you calling him?

08:51.085 --> 08:53.045
- Her.
- Or her?

08:55.205 --> 09:00.484
Okay, we're going to call right
now and get you a meeting.

09:01.884 --> 09:03.563
Really Mary there's no point.

09:03.565 --> 09:06.765
Yep, come on.

09:07.445 --> 09:08.762
- Hello?
- Hello.

09:08.764 --> 09:11.282
Yes I'm calling on
behalf of Jack Winter,

09:11.284 --> 09:13.323
I'm his publicist.

09:13.325 --> 09:16.443
Yeah we require and an
urgent meeting with...

09:16.445 --> 09:18.685
- Vivian.
- With Vivian.

09:19.205 --> 09:21.282
Yes, it's important,

09:21.284 --> 09:24.963
we want a meeting
today, this afternoon.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.244
Two p.m.

09:27.205 --> 09:28.002
Yeah?

09:28.004 --> 09:30.362
That'll be great, what?

09:30.364 --> 09:31.484
Yes.

09:33.764 --> 09:35.642
I'm sure that will
be fine, thanks.

09:35.644 --> 09:37.242
How did you do that?

09:37.244 --> 09:39.602
I had a great job in HR
before Daisy came along

09:39.604 --> 09:41.203
and buggered all that up.

09:41.205 --> 09:44.163
Oh by the way your agent
wants a skim double mocha

09:44.165 --> 09:47.002
chocolate latte with
cream and four sugars.

09:47.965 --> 09:49.524
No problem.

09:50.404 --> 09:53.402
Thanks for the
coffee Jack, excellent.

09:53.404 --> 09:54.964
No problem.

09:59.604 --> 10:04.805
So what's all this
very urgent, important,

10:05.524 --> 10:07.284
who's your publicist anyway?

10:09.404 --> 10:13.083
- Well...
- Oh Jack.

10:13.085 --> 10:19.002
Nice try, look I am busy but
there is no work, nothing.

10:19.004 --> 10:20.362
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

10:20.364 --> 10:22.443
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

10:22.445 --> 10:23.725
Anything?

10:24.604 --> 10:27.443
Look I'm not just a fiction
writer okay, I can do anything.

10:27.445 --> 10:32.285
Reviews, articles, historical,
factual, recipes, anything.

10:33.565 --> 10:35.325
- Anything?
- Anything.

10:39.364 --> 10:40.723
Look there is one thing.

10:40.725 --> 10:42.122
You live near the
countryside yeah?

10:42.124 --> 10:43.965
- Yeah.
- Near a forest?

10:46.445 --> 10:48.443
There's an unfinished book

10:48.445 --> 10:50.482
called The Legend of
the Black Flowers.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.122
Nobody wants to touch it.

10:52.124 --> 10:57.163
It's a mythical, historical
look at ancient pagan forests

10:57.165 --> 11:02.923
and the links with witchcraft
and demonology, devil worship.

11:02.925 --> 11:05.402
Really quite disturbing stuff.

11:05.404 --> 11:09.364
"We make up horrors to help
us cope with the real ones."

11:16.244 --> 11:20.043
Avelin Eldridge,
fancy writer from the 70's,

11:20.045 --> 11:23.323
wrote a trilogy that
was never finished.

11:23.325 --> 11:28.122
Anyway the project's been
dormant for three years.

11:28.124 --> 11:31.282
It needs life,
it just needs finishing.

11:31.284 --> 11:34.043
What happened to the
original author, Avelin?

11:34.045 --> 11:35.604
He killed himself.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.843
He was quite disturbed anyway

11:38.845 --> 11:42.362
and the book just ate him up,
nothing to worry about.

11:42.364 --> 11:45.644
Look the book's 70% done.

11:45.925 --> 11:47.443
I just need you to tart it up,

11:47.445 --> 11:50.482
finish it off,
put it to bed, give it 110%.

11:50.484 --> 11:52.002
It's actually quite
an interesting story,

11:52.004 --> 11:56.362
you just need to visit
these five locations

11:56.364 --> 11:57.482
and if you get it right

11:57.484 --> 11:59.482
you might actually
make me some money.

11:59.484 --> 12:01.083
Oh yeah money.

12:01.085 --> 12:04.203
Two K when you finished it,
two months from today okay?

12:04.205 --> 12:05.882
Can you go a bit higher?

12:05.884 --> 12:08.602
- It's my daughter.
- Don't care.

12:08.604 --> 12:10.484
Go, go.

12:11.205 --> 12:12.565
Really?

12:12.925 --> 12:14.402
Just.

12:14.404 --> 12:15.804
Thank you.

12:17.205 --> 12:18.285
Go!

12:49.524 --> 12:51.843
Nice spade you got there.

12:51.845 --> 12:53.482
You scared me.

12:53.484 --> 12:56.044
You're lucky that's all I did.

12:59.884 --> 13:01.404
Let's have a look.

13:06.805 --> 13:09.364
Oh, sharp.

13:11.725 --> 13:13.043
'Course it's sharp,

13:13.045 --> 13:15.282
can't dig if it's not sharp.

13:17.284 --> 13:20.522
You're a little
monkey aren't you?

13:20.524 --> 13:23.203
So what are you digging for?

13:23.205 --> 13:24.723
Buried treasure.

13:24.725 --> 13:26.602
If I can find some treasure

13:26.604 --> 13:28.443
then Dad wouldn't be so
worried all the time.

13:28.445 --> 13:31.563
We could have a holiday
on the beach, a TV,

13:31.565 --> 13:34.725
some electronics,
maybe even a pony.

13:35.764 --> 13:38.043
So it's you then
that's been digging

13:38.045 --> 13:40.402
all them holes in the forest.

13:40.404 --> 13:44.484
Yep, 327 so far.

13:48.165 --> 13:49.765
Can I see your gun?

13:57.484 --> 13:58.604
Yes.

14:08.604 --> 14:12.083
Ah come on you
gotta hold it right.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.642
Okay now put the
handle in there,

14:14.644 --> 14:18.402
in your shoulder,
all right, tight.

14:18.404 --> 14:24.164
All right now get your
sight along the barrel.

14:24.445 --> 14:29.683
All right gently
squeeze the trigger.

14:29.685 --> 14:39.364
Not too hard, gently squeeze,
gently, that's it, lovely.

14:39.565 --> 14:44.005
Squeeze, that's it, lovely.

14:46.325 --> 14:47.565
Oh!

14:48.524 --> 14:50.043
You got me.

14:50.045 --> 14:53.602
Oh did you think I was
gonna leave it loaded?

14:58.404 --> 15:00.684
Have you ever killed anyone?

15:01.685 --> 15:05.525
No, but the gun has.

15:11.124 --> 15:12.642
Did you know that
the old soldiers,

15:12.644 --> 15:14.323
they used to use
big round buttons

15:14.325 --> 15:17.604
from their jackets for bullets.

15:18.004 --> 15:21.602
If the worst came to
the worst.

15:21.604 --> 15:23.522
Yeah, gun can fire anything.

15:23.524 --> 15:26.683
Dad will ask me if I'm
okay and if I've eaten.

15:26.685 --> 15:31.402
If I say no he'll say,
"why not" like it's my fault.

15:31.404 --> 15:32.964
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

15:35.325 --> 15:37.725
- Have you eaten?
- No.

15:38.004 --> 15:39.284
Why not?

15:40.004 --> 15:41.684
Evening neighbor.

15:42.725 --> 15:44.762
I was just saying to
your daughter here

15:44.764 --> 15:48.242
that she should be
digging near a marker.

15:48.244 --> 15:52.602
See people leave markers
when they bury treasure

15:52.604 --> 15:54.642
in case something
should happen to them

15:54.644 --> 15:57.723
and then someone
else can find it.

15:57.725 --> 16:00.203
What sort of something?

16:00.205 --> 16:01.723
Well you know something

16:01.725 --> 16:04.122
that means they
couldn't come back.

16:04.124 --> 16:06.762
Why wouldn't they come back?

16:06.764 --> 16:10.284
Oh you know, people forget,

16:11.124 --> 16:15.845
people move away,
people die!

16:16.284 --> 16:17.602
A bit scary.

16:17.604 --> 16:19.843
No no, I'm only
trying to help you

16:19.845 --> 16:22.325
find the treasure that's all.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.764
Evening neighbor.

16:30.925 --> 16:34.685
- Weirdo.
- Yeah, your spade.

17:21.763 --> 17:23.844
- Dad.
- Yeah.

17:24.324 --> 17:26.242
I can't sleep.

17:26.243 --> 17:28.405
I keep seeing shadows and,

17:30.764 --> 17:34.524
there's an evil creature
behind the curtain.

17:47.764 --> 17:49.322
There's nothing there.

17:49.324 --> 17:51.242
Now go back to sleep,
you've got school tomorrow

17:51.244 --> 17:53.082
and I don't need you
keeping me up all night.

17:53.084 --> 17:55.363
You can pack your
bags in the morning.

18:03.965 --> 18:07.084
Oh come on it's freezing.

18:08.084 --> 18:09.322
Why I'm having a snog.

18:09.324 --> 18:10.842
Yeah well I'm freezing

18:10.844 --> 18:13.522
waiting for you to finish
snogging that dick.

18:13.524 --> 18:15.802
- He's no dick.
- I'm not a dick.

18:15.804 --> 18:19.603
If he wasn't a dick he have
given us a lift to the pub

18:19.605 --> 18:23.282
and we wouldn't to
have to fucking walk.

18:23.284 --> 18:27.482
All right he is a dick,
but he is a good snog.

18:29.925 --> 18:31.163
It's like in that story,

18:31.165 --> 18:32.883
you know, they really
followed the stars.

18:34.205 --> 18:35.802
You follow one star.

18:35.804 --> 18:39.044
Yeah but there
are four stars.

18:39.445 --> 18:41.683
Well what
do you expect anyway?

18:41.685 --> 18:45.845
Airplane,
UFO.

18:48.804 --> 18:53.322
Colin, stop it's not funny.

18:53.324 --> 18:54.363
Come on
let's just keep moving.

18:54.365 --> 18:56.042
Stop it you prick.

18:56.044 --> 18:58.644
- I told you he's a dick.
- Oh shut up.

19:01.244 --> 19:03.363
Fucking hell, all
right what was that?

19:03.365 --> 19:04.923
I don't know.

19:11.564 --> 19:13.643
Shit it's in front of us.

19:13.645 --> 19:15.802
Let's just get back
to the pub and ring a taxi.

19:15.804 --> 19:17.443
Okay.

19:46.165 --> 19:47.482
Shit.

19:52.524 --> 19:57.324
Oh shit, late late
late, bloody nightmares.

20:04.004 --> 20:05.723
- What?
- P-post.

20:05.725 --> 20:08.764
- I can't find your post box.
- We ain't got one.

20:11.965 --> 20:13.082
You're not Fred, what
happened to Fred?

20:13.084 --> 20:15.403
I don't know, life,
redundancy, who knows?

20:15.405 --> 20:16.923
People move away.

20:16.925 --> 20:18.042
Dad I'm
gonna be late for school.

20:18.044 --> 20:21.364
You've got me now,
Patricia postwoman.

20:23.725 --> 20:25.443
Haven't got a letter box.

20:25.445 --> 20:26.883
Bills.

20:26.885 --> 20:29.482
It's the first day of the
new term, I need to be on time.

20:29.484 --> 20:30.723
Bills, bills.

20:30.725 --> 20:33.324
I won't
know what class I'm in.

20:34.844 --> 20:36.123
Hello.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.085
What's this?

20:56.764 --> 20:57.965
What now?

20:59.004 --> 21:01.762
- Morning sir.
- Sorry officer,

21:01.764 --> 21:03.242
I thought you were someone else.

21:03.244 --> 21:06.322
We're making some
inquiries in the area.

21:06.324 --> 21:09.723
Did you hear or see anything
strange last night sir?

21:09.725 --> 21:10.802
Strange?

21:10.804 --> 21:12.042
Out of the ordinary.

21:12.044 --> 21:15.802
No I don't think so,
nothing I can think of.

21:15.804 --> 21:18.363
Hey, well my daughter you
know she has bad dreams

21:18.365 --> 21:19.762
so I'm used to hearing
screams in the night.

21:19.764 --> 21:22.683
Screams sir, I never
mentioned screams.

21:22.685 --> 21:24.802
- I'm 10.
- She's 10.

21:29.125 --> 21:30.802
We're investigating
a violent assault

21:30.804 --> 21:32.282
in the woods over there.

21:38.804 --> 21:39.965
Poppy!

21:43.084 --> 21:45.644
Really, an assault?

21:46.044 --> 21:47.603
This is a nice little community

21:47.605 --> 21:50.925
and we don't have assaults here.

21:51.284 --> 21:53.562
You're new aren't you?

21:53.564 --> 21:56.082
Yes sir, Constable Black.

21:56.084 --> 21:59.042
What happened to the
other one, what's his name?

21:59.044 --> 22:01.884
- Constable Jones.
- He left sir.

22:03.004 --> 22:06.165
People move away, cut backs.

22:07.044 --> 22:09.403
Look sorry I'd really
like to but I can't,

22:09.405 --> 22:10.683
I've gotta get my kid to school.

22:10.685 --> 22:12.082
Do let us know if
you think of anything,

22:12.084 --> 22:14.244
thank you for your time sir.

22:20.205 --> 22:22.643
Get a move on will you?

22:22.645 --> 22:23.883
We should've got
ready last night.

22:23.885 --> 22:26.925
I told you to get packed
last night Eternity.

22:27.125 --> 22:28.765
Oh where are my keys?

22:32.764 --> 22:34.205
Come on!

22:36.165 --> 22:37.522
Just doing up my shoelaces,

22:37.524 --> 22:39.963
we're gonna be out of
here in two seconds 'kay?

22:39.965 --> 22:41.562
Got 15 minutes.

22:41.564 --> 22:43.163
Gonna be stuck behind
traffic or gonna be stuck

22:43.165 --> 22:45.282
behind a bloody combine
harvester or tractor now.

22:45.284 --> 22:48.524
Late on the first day,
bloody bollocks.

22:55.564 --> 22:57.164
Come on!

23:04.844 --> 23:07.044
- Dad.
- What?

23:07.324 --> 23:09.042
Are we late because
you had nightmares again?

23:09.044 --> 23:11.363
No, well
maybe a little one.

23:11.365 --> 23:14.203
Were they about Mom, don't
worry, you don't need to worry.

23:14.205 --> 23:15.923
You shouldn't try to
scare me you know,

23:15.925 --> 23:17.842
you'll only give
yourself bad dreams.

23:17.844 --> 23:22.404
If you think you're dreaming
pinch yourself, you'll be okay.

23:23.844 --> 23:25.363
- Dad.
- Yep?

23:25.365 --> 23:27.683
You know
what I wonder about?

23:27.685 --> 23:30.723
- What flavor are jellyfish.
- No silly.

23:30.725 --> 23:32.923
What are all those
red phone boxes for?

23:32.925 --> 23:36.123
I mean everyone has a
mobile phone except me

23:36.125 --> 23:37.603
so why do we need them?

23:37.605 --> 23:41.683
I had a sniff in one
and it smelled horrid

23:41.685 --> 23:46.484
though I did find a 20 P coin
so it wasn't a total disaster.

23:50.685 --> 23:52.244
Right here we are.

23:53.605 --> 23:54.685
Be good yeah?

23:56.125 --> 23:57.885
All right, love you.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.123
I know it's only been 24 hours

24:01.125 --> 24:03.123
but my friend Poppy
is still missing.

24:03.125 --> 24:05.285
Something bad happened.

24:05.925 --> 24:08.685
But why 48 hours,
it's ridiculous.

24:10.605 --> 24:14.765
Well I hope your best friend
disappears you asshole.

24:17.205 --> 24:18.963
They won't take me seriously.

24:18.965 --> 24:21.562
They say they're looking into
it but I know that's bollocks.

24:21.564 --> 24:25.725
I still don't know why the
police aren't helping out.

24:29.564 --> 24:30.924
What did you do?

24:32.244 --> 24:34.683
We got busted for drugs Mom.

24:34.685 --> 24:37.165
Last summer, LSD and mushrooms.

24:38.725 --> 24:41.082
I got so high I thought I
was being chased by unicorns

24:41.084 --> 24:42.443
so I ran off and then
Poppy went missing.

24:42.445 --> 24:45.282
Police found her
off her face in a ditch.

24:45.284 --> 24:48.165
Oh you stupid
stupid bloody kids.

24:51.084 --> 24:52.403
If
I was gonna get paid

24:52.405 --> 24:54.242
I had to get on with
finishing Eldridge's book.

24:54.244 --> 24:56.482
I read all his notes
but they made no sense,

24:56.484 --> 24:58.002
but it was clear
he was searching

24:58.004 --> 24:59.883
for the elusive black flowers.

24:59.885 --> 25:01.683
But what they were
remained a mystery.

25:01.685 --> 25:03.443
I decided to visit
the last few locations

25:03.445 --> 25:04.923
mentioned in his manuscript.

25:04.925 --> 25:06.963
This took me beyond the
boundary of the forest

25:06.965 --> 25:10.042
and to the very edge
of the land itself.

25:10.044 --> 25:12.963
It took me to the largest
beech trees in all the realm,

25:12.965 --> 25:14.562
a ruined hilltop church,

25:14.564 --> 25:18.203
where on a good day
you could see forever

25:18.205 --> 25:19.923
and an ancient Roman battlefield

25:19.925 --> 25:22.203
right in the heart of the woods

25:22.205 --> 25:25.564
where I used to go for
walks with my wife.

25:29.084 --> 25:30.444
Eternity,

25:30.804 --> 25:31.842
you all right?

25:31.844 --> 25:33.562
Dad forgot me Miss.

25:33.564 --> 25:36.522
It wouldn't be that,
it'll be the traffic.

25:36.524 --> 25:38.284
Mom never forgot me.

25:40.484 --> 25:43.084
Would you like me
to give you a lift?

25:43.564 --> 25:46.084
No thanks Miss,
I know the way.

25:48.445 --> 25:54.445
Eternity I don't think
that, goodness.

27:13.004 --> 27:14.364
Dinner.

27:32.645 --> 27:33.965
Dad.

27:37.284 --> 27:38.723
Am I a bastard?

27:38.725 --> 27:42.282
What no, Eternity
what made you say that?

27:42.284 --> 27:43.363
A kid at school said I was.

27:43.365 --> 27:46.163
- You're a bastard.
- Your mom's dead.

27:46.165 --> 27:49.282
She drowned in
a lake, bastard.

27:49.284 --> 27:50.562
No I'm not!

27:50.564 --> 27:53.042
I'll curse you and
you'll all die.

27:53.044 --> 27:57.643
Your mommy and I were
married when you were born.

27:57.645 --> 27:59.482
Then how come I'm
in the wedding photos?

27:59.484 --> 28:02.802
Right okay,
that kid is a bully.

28:02.804 --> 28:04.242
Do you know how to
deal with bullies?

28:04.244 --> 28:05.564
No.

28:09.205 --> 28:10.605
Give that here.

28:13.844 --> 28:17.282
Hold out your hand
flat like this.

28:17.284 --> 28:19.963
Right, when the
bully comes close

28:19.965 --> 28:22.482
he's gonna be looking
at your flat hand

28:22.484 --> 28:25.923
so with your other
hand you ball that up,

28:25.925 --> 28:29.963
this is your fighting hand,
your hitting hand,

28:29.965 --> 28:33.322
ready to wack him
when he comes close.

28:33.324 --> 28:34.562
Ow you got me, say I got ya.

28:34.564 --> 28:36.042
- I got ya.
- Yeah.

28:36.044 --> 28:37.082
Yes.

28:44.244 --> 28:46.603
If you don't want
to wack someone right,

28:46.605 --> 28:49.565
then I've got
something much better.

28:51.365 --> 28:53.042
You know those Roman soldiers
in your history book?

28:53.044 --> 28:54.443
The ones
who killed Jesus?

28:54.445 --> 28:56.002
Well I wasn't exactly
thinking of those ones

28:56.004 --> 28:59.482
but yeah Roman
soldiers, all right.

28:59.484 --> 29:01.842
Well Roman soldiers
are the best,

29:01.844 --> 29:03.282
they're the best in the world,

29:03.284 --> 29:04.923
all right, they're brilliant

29:04.925 --> 29:08.365
and they've got these
really good archers.

29:08.605 --> 29:11.163
So when you're really in trouble

29:11.165 --> 29:14.723
and you really need them
you call out for them

29:14.725 --> 29:17.443
and they will appear behind you,

29:17.445 --> 29:19.723
- a whole phalanx of them.
- What?

29:19.725 --> 29:21.562
A whole load of them
will appear behind you

29:21.564 --> 29:24.123
with their bows and arrows and
whoever is threatening you,

29:24.125 --> 29:27.082
they will be scared to death.

29:27.084 --> 29:28.484
Wow.

29:30.524 --> 29:32.802
But you can never see them,

29:32.804 --> 29:34.603
they will only appear behind you

29:34.605 --> 29:36.603
and you can't turn to face them

29:36.605 --> 29:42.163
'cause if you do right they
will stab you in the guts

29:42.165 --> 29:43.522
with their short swords

29:43.524 --> 29:46.482
and then all your guts come
out like a bag of worms

29:46.484 --> 29:47.764
and you'll die.

29:54.484 --> 30:00.405
So, remember,
ball up those little fists

30:01.244 --> 30:04.762
and have faith those Romans
will never let you down.

30:04.764 --> 30:05.923
And what if they do?

30:05.925 --> 30:07.042
They won't.

30:07.044 --> 30:09.603
All right let's finish this.

30:21.284 --> 30:23.002
If I ever get too ill or too old

30:23.004 --> 30:25.163
to have a beer under the stars

30:25.165 --> 30:27.562
I want you to put
me in a little boat

30:27.564 --> 30:31.603
and set fire to it,
like the vikings did, 'kay?

30:31.605 --> 30:32.603
What kind of boat?

30:32.605 --> 30:33.923
A little wooden one

30:33.925 --> 30:37.403
and remember to pack
the firewood properly.

30:37.405 --> 30:39.165
Okay I promise.

30:43.965 --> 30:46.524
I wish Mom could've been here.

30:50.645 --> 30:52.883
You see that star up there?

30:52.885 --> 30:54.643
The little one?

30:54.645 --> 30:56.325
They're all little ones.

30:57.084 --> 31:01.363
But yeah that one, that's
a part of Andromeda.

31:01.365 --> 31:04.643
Andromeda was the daughter
of Queen Cassiopeia

31:04.645 --> 31:07.082
and she was so beautiful

31:07.084 --> 31:10.644
that they named a
constellation after her.

31:11.564 --> 31:14.603
Your mom was so pretty

31:14.605 --> 31:16.643
that the gods couldn't
bear to be without her

31:16.645 --> 31:20.685
so they took her home
early and left us behind.

31:26.084 --> 31:28.444
Your mom is up in the stars.

31:30.965 --> 31:32.165
Wow.

31:32.925 --> 31:34.723
Mom are you out there?

31:34.725 --> 31:37.324
Mom I miss you.

31:39.645 --> 31:41.484
Dad, look Dad.

31:44.125 --> 31:46.042
Who's there?

31:46.044 --> 31:47.484
He's scary.

31:57.685 --> 31:58.965
Evening.

31:59.564 --> 32:01.445
Found that treasure yet?

32:03.084 --> 32:04.725
We're stargazing.

32:05.645 --> 32:07.002
What you doing up so late?

32:07.004 --> 32:11.802
Lost something, something
that glows in the dark.

32:11.804 --> 32:13.242
Like a watch?

32:13.244 --> 32:16.282
That's right, like a watch.

32:16.284 --> 32:17.844
Goodnight neighbors.

32:19.365 --> 32:22.645
Sweet dreams.

32:23.844 --> 32:25.404
Goodnight.

32:26.205 --> 32:28.002
Should we go in?

32:28.004 --> 32:29.685
Yeah, let's.

32:32.284 --> 32:33.764
Can you get that?

32:54.044 --> 32:54.884
Bollocks!

32:59.445 --> 33:01.723
Bloody electricity's gone.

33:01.725 --> 33:05.844
I know, mysterious.

33:22.405 --> 33:23.605
Jack!

33:24.205 --> 33:26.564
Jack help me.

33:35.084 --> 33:38.883
Jack, he's coming, you
must protect Eternity.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.325
Man I don't need this.

34:17.884 --> 34:19.324
For fuck's sake.

34:29.045 --> 34:30.643
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

34:30.645 --> 34:31.962
Playing computer.

34:31.964 --> 34:35.242
- It's four in the morning.
- But I can't sleep.

34:35.244 --> 34:36.804
No Dad!

34:38.005 --> 34:39.442
No more computer games.

35:17.964 --> 35:21.044
Daddy why did you do it?

35:24.645 --> 35:26.244
No!

35:28.364 --> 35:30.604
Daddy you were screaming.

35:32.804 --> 35:35.924
Oh, just a bad dream.

35:36.284 --> 35:39.962
It's okay, you can sleep
with me and Mr. Bun tonight.

35:39.964 --> 35:42.442
We'll look after you.

35:51.525 --> 35:52.764
Morning.

35:54.804 --> 35:56.922
I take it you've got
no school today then.

35:56.924 --> 36:00.003
- It's a half day.
- Which half?

36:00.005 --> 36:01.645
I'll find out.

36:02.804 --> 36:05.442
I've got to do some
research today for the book

36:05.444 --> 36:07.003
so I can get paid and keep you

36:07.005 --> 36:08.483
in the cereal
you're accustomed to

36:08.485 --> 36:10.282
so I'm gonna need
to get you a sitter.

36:10.284 --> 36:12.962
I don't need a sitter, I'm 10.

36:12.964 --> 36:15.684
Yeah but society
has a different view.

36:17.525 --> 36:19.565
Oh god.

36:26.804 --> 36:28.123
What's that?

36:28.125 --> 36:31.445
A list of all the
babysitters I've ever had.

36:32.485 --> 36:33.445
All right.

36:42.804 --> 36:46.964
Hello Iona long time...

36:53.085 --> 36:54.244
Hi Keesha.

36:56.324 --> 36:57.444
No?

36:59.804 --> 37:01.764
She's really fond of you.

37:02.645 --> 37:03.922
What do you mean Eternity's

37:03.924 --> 37:06.205
the kind of girl
you want to slap?

37:07.525 --> 37:09.003
Well I'm sure she
didn't mean to bite you.

37:09.005 --> 37:10.362
She drew blood?

37:10.364 --> 37:12.643
Stole your spade?

37:12.645 --> 37:15.165
I did wonder where
she got that from.

37:16.964 --> 37:18.043
Yes.

37:18.045 --> 37:21.125
Yes it's Jack Winter,
Eternity's dad.

37:23.605 --> 37:25.723
Yeah I know, I'll pay
it as soon as I can.

37:25.725 --> 37:27.565
All right sorry about that one.

37:32.244 --> 37:35.484
Hello, yeah, and what
sort of parent are you?

38:04.525 --> 38:05.845
Show me.

38:15.485 --> 38:16.845
No.

38:17.525 --> 38:20.764
- Eternity what have you done?
- I'm sorry.

38:21.165 --> 38:24.003
Right that is it you
are grounded for a week.

38:24.005 --> 38:25.523
No more treasure hunting.

38:25.525 --> 38:28.882
No no, it was an accident
and it's not my fault.

38:28.884 --> 38:31.123
Well whose fault was it then?

38:31.125 --> 38:33.685
- Spade.
- Spade's?

38:35.324 --> 38:37.882
I cannot cope okay.

38:37.884 --> 38:39.523
We've got no money
and I cannot work

38:39.525 --> 38:41.685
unless I get a sitter.

38:43.085 --> 38:45.605
I don't want a sitter.

38:46.485 --> 38:48.085
Are you an idiot?

38:49.005 --> 38:51.083
Are you stupid?

38:51.085 --> 38:52.762
I can cope all by myself.

38:52.764 --> 38:57.043
I don't need a sitter
and I don't need you.

38:57.045 --> 38:59.083
Ow.

38:59.085 --> 39:01.603
Eternity I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry, I'm really sorry.

39:01.605 --> 39:04.242
Get of me you
idiot, I hate you!

39:04.244 --> 39:06.364
I hope you die!

39:07.244 --> 39:09.003
Then you turn into a tree

39:09.005 --> 39:11.723
and then I can cut you down
and burn you like a log!

39:28.085 --> 39:31.043
Stupid spade,
I'll show you spade.

39:56.884 --> 39:58.044
I'm sorry spade.

39:59.404 --> 40:02.242
You've been a good friend
but now you've been bad,

40:02.244 --> 40:05.402
you got me electrocuted
and nearly dead,

40:05.404 --> 40:06.685
and grounded.

40:08.645 --> 40:10.485
And now you have to go.

40:12.085 --> 40:15.485
It's time to move
on, I'll miss you.

40:20.444 --> 40:23.084
Eternity, Eternity, Eternity.

40:24.605 --> 40:26.085
Eternity, Eternity.

40:34.525 --> 40:37.485
Eternity, don't give up.

40:37.725 --> 40:41.603
Keep looking, follow
the signs, keep looking.

40:41.605 --> 40:43.643
Mom I miss you, where are you?

40:43.645 --> 40:47.523
Follow the signs
Eternity, don't give up,

40:47.525 --> 40:52.645
keep looking, follow
the signs, Eternity,

40:52.964 --> 40:57.924
don't give up, keep
looking, follow the signs.

40:58.125 --> 41:01.563
I think I'm supposed to keep
digging for treasure spade.

41:01.565 --> 41:03.205
Where should I dig?

41:21.085 --> 41:22.565
Jack, hello Jack.

41:24.364 --> 41:27.205
- Oh.
- Hi Mary, all right.

41:27.605 --> 41:29.362
Just thought we'd pop around
to see if you're all right.

41:29.364 --> 41:30.362
Why?

41:30.364 --> 41:31.962
Well we were worried.

41:31.964 --> 41:33.523
Daisy and her friend Poppy
were attacked in the woods.

41:33.525 --> 41:35.603
Poppy's still missing.

41:35.605 --> 41:38.282
Yeah I heard, the
policewoman came around.

41:38.284 --> 41:39.402
You all right?

41:39.404 --> 41:41.762
Well we've all got
to be extra careful.

41:41.764 --> 41:43.844
Where is Eternity anyway?

41:44.764 --> 41:47.244
She's inside sleeping.

41:50.605 --> 41:52.925
So what about Poppy then?

41:54.244 --> 41:55.922
Police say we have
to wait 48 hours

41:55.924 --> 41:58.564
before she's officially missing.

41:59.884 --> 42:02.123
Well look anyway
we bought you this,

42:02.125 --> 42:06.043
bread, jam, some beer,
a piece of cake for Eternity.

42:06.045 --> 42:09.405
- You know, just to help out.
- Mary.

42:10.165 --> 42:11.083
You should've have done that.

42:11.085 --> 42:13.362
Oh look well Eloise is gone,

42:13.364 --> 42:15.884
but Eternity's still here.

42:16.605 --> 42:20.205
Do you understand,
she's 10 for god's sake.

42:20.685 --> 42:23.003
She's got an old soul.

42:23.005 --> 42:26.925
Old soul, such
nonsense, she's 10.

42:31.725 --> 42:33.683
- I need a babysitter.
- 30 quid.

42:33.685 --> 42:34.962
I'll do it for 30 quid.

42:34.964 --> 42:36.322
30 quid for
a couple of hours?

42:36.324 --> 42:39.125
All right, 40 if you're
being a dick about it.

42:39.725 --> 42:44.165
30 it is then,
thanks Daisy, thanks Mary.

42:44.565 --> 42:45.325
All right.

42:49.324 --> 42:50.284
Good.

43:26.964 --> 43:30.442
You must
protect yourself Eternity.

43:30.444 --> 43:32.524
You must fight the monster.

43:37.404 --> 43:40.523
- Hey, give it back.
- What's it worth?

43:40.525 --> 43:42.083
I won't kill you.

43:42.085 --> 43:44.683
- Oh yeah you and whose army?
- Whose army?

43:44.685 --> 43:46.362
Hey.

43:46.364 --> 43:47.404
My undead army.

43:49.764 --> 43:52.882
I command you my Roman
legionaries to come to my aid

43:52.884 --> 43:56.564
and kill these idiots
with your magic arrows.

44:04.125 --> 44:08.085
Well goodbye,
look at the sight of her.

44:09.364 --> 44:10.603
Got my box back.

44:10.605 --> 44:13.965
They're scared of me, I win.

44:14.324 --> 44:16.962
So what happened with
you then last night?

44:16.964 --> 44:18.364
No way.

44:19.404 --> 44:21.884
Shut up, no he didn't.

44:23.085 --> 44:24.523
Oh my god.

44:24.525 --> 44:26.442
Yeah I'm just at work.

44:26.444 --> 44:28.444
Yeah it's really boring.

44:28.884 --> 44:31.683
No nothing really,
five days a week.

44:31.685 --> 44:33.402
Shit yeah.

44:33.404 --> 44:35.523
Like every time someone comes in

44:35.525 --> 44:37.643
which is hardly ever,

44:37.645 --> 44:40.362
they just sit there and
don't even talk to me

44:40.364 --> 44:42.203
so I have to just
sit on my phone.

44:42.205 --> 44:44.922
So many idiots who come
here, like literally.

44:44.924 --> 44:47.203
You'll never guess what
happened yesterday yeah.

44:47.205 --> 44:50.163
Some man decided to
pee in the elevator

44:50.165 --> 44:51.402
and I had to clean it up.

44:51.404 --> 44:53.362
I thought well
that's not my job.

44:53.364 --> 44:56.362
I know, didn't even
get a thank you.

44:56.364 --> 44:58.563
Yeah anyway, what's a
matter with you then?

44:58.565 --> 44:59.762
Well she never told me that

44:59.764 --> 45:01.083
and I've done a bunch for her.

45:01.085 --> 45:02.723
Hung out with all of them.

45:02.725 --> 45:05.483
Yeah I know, I wasn't
gonna fight him last night.

45:05.485 --> 45:09.445
Shut up, no he didn't,
I don't believe you at all, no.

45:12.244 --> 45:14.762
Now I've got some weird
kid looking at me.

45:14.764 --> 45:17.484
Yeah, I know.

45:18.924 --> 45:22.563
I don't know what
she's doing, yeah,

45:22.565 --> 45:27.563
she just, she just run out and
put her sandwich on my desk.

45:27.565 --> 45:31.882
Oh well, I'll eat it
anyway, let's have a look.

45:31.884 --> 45:33.764
Cheese my favorite, mm.

46:04.165 --> 46:05.083
Hello.

46:05.085 --> 46:07.483
What are you doing in my wood?

46:07.485 --> 46:08.882
Your wood is it?

46:08.884 --> 46:10.123
Yes.

46:10.125 --> 46:12.282
Should you be
walking on your own?

46:12.284 --> 46:15.683
I'm not on my own,
I've got this stick.

46:15.685 --> 46:18.483
Which FYI could take
your eyeballs out.

46:18.485 --> 46:21.282
Of course, well I think
you should run along home

46:21.284 --> 46:23.003
as quick as you can.

46:23.005 --> 46:25.842
I am, you're stopping
me, I've got stuff to do.

46:25.844 --> 46:28.163
Okay, I see.

46:28.165 --> 46:29.882
Well take care.

46:52.884 --> 46:54.524
What a mess here.

47:08.485 --> 47:09.962
What's that?

47:09.964 --> 47:12.164
Not now, I'm busy.

47:26.565 --> 47:28.322
I'm trying to work
out the relationship

47:28.324 --> 47:29.762
between these five places.

47:29.764 --> 47:31.205
Where are they?

47:33.324 --> 47:34.685
Well one's here.

47:37.404 --> 47:38.884
No don't do that.

47:42.764 --> 47:44.605
And there's one here.

47:47.725 --> 47:49.085
One here.

47:50.605 --> 47:51.685
Here.

47:53.284 --> 47:55.004
And here.

47:56.685 --> 47:58.282
Five of them.

47:58.284 --> 47:59.524
Where's that?

48:00.645 --> 48:03.683
That is farmer Sykes' farm.

48:03.685 --> 48:05.402
What all of it?

48:05.404 --> 48:08.165
Yeah, he's
expanding his empire.

48:10.244 --> 48:11.802
And that?

48:11.804 --> 48:13.565
That's the forest.

48:15.284 --> 48:16.844
Where's our house?

48:18.444 --> 48:20.244
That's us there.

48:23.165 --> 48:25.005
- Dad.
- Mm-hm?

48:26.884 --> 48:29.523
Can I go to the
hardware store please?

48:29.525 --> 48:30.723
- What for?
- A thing.

48:30.725 --> 48:32.565
- What thing?
- A thing.

48:34.364 --> 48:36.242
Maybe later.

48:36.244 --> 48:38.725
You always say maybe later.

48:44.045 --> 48:46.523
All right then,
I'll get my keys.

48:46.525 --> 48:49.683
Keys.

48:49.685 --> 48:51.683
Nice, right, straight
to the hardware store

48:51.685 --> 48:53.163
and then straight back okay

48:53.165 --> 48:56.804
'cause I've got work to
do, no mucking about.

48:58.005 --> 49:01.123
This thing then,
is it a cheap thing

49:01.125 --> 49:03.762
or is it an expensive thing?

49:03.764 --> 49:06.605
Is it a thing, or
a couple of things?

49:12.444 --> 49:13.725
Can I help you?

49:26.844 --> 49:29.964
We haven't got bore
scrubber foaming gel.

49:30.605 --> 49:32.762
Well some silicone oil

49:32.764 --> 49:37.364
and a barrel and chamber
cleaning tool will do in a push.

49:38.525 --> 49:41.085
So what do you need
all these things for?

49:41.485 --> 49:43.842
To be honest it's
none of your business.

49:43.844 --> 49:45.884
A bit rude that, sorry.

49:48.205 --> 49:50.242
I need it to fix my gun

49:50.244 --> 49:54.404
so I can kill all the monsters
in my room dead forever.

49:56.605 --> 49:57.685
Kids eh?

50:05.205 --> 50:08.242
Okay Daisy's gonna be
here later all right?

50:08.244 --> 50:09.163
Yep.

50:09.165 --> 50:10.442
Are you gonna be a good girl

50:10.444 --> 50:12.163
now that I've spent
all that money...

50:12.165 --> 50:14.005
- Yes Dad.
- On a thing.

51:42.444 --> 51:44.802
Please,
please help me.

51:45.804 --> 51:48.003
- Help me.
- Oh my god.

51:52.804 --> 51:59.085
Please, please help me
I, I don't feel so good.

52:23.244 --> 52:25.802
Black Flower.

52:39.205 --> 52:40.483
The ancient maps

52:40.485 --> 52:42.523
in Eldridge's Black
Flower manuscript

52:42.525 --> 52:47.605
led me to a strange tower right
in the heart of the forest.

52:48.404 --> 52:51.922
It was the last location
Eldridge visited

52:51.924 --> 52:54.725
before his untimely death.

53:06.884 --> 53:10.882
I'm the curator,
how can I help you?

53:10.884 --> 53:13.723
Jack Winter, I spoke to
you on the phone earlier.

53:13.725 --> 53:15.483
Ah yes, the writer.

53:15.485 --> 53:18.083
I'm an avid reader, when
it comes to literature

53:18.085 --> 53:20.003
I have the heart
of a little boy.

53:20.005 --> 53:21.123
That's good to hear.

53:21.125 --> 53:23.764
And I keep it in
a jar on my desk.

53:26.605 --> 53:29.043
So what do you
actually curate here?

53:29.045 --> 53:33.163
Oh the things that nobody
wants to look after anymore.

53:33.165 --> 53:34.605
Forgotten things.

53:36.884 --> 53:38.083
What do you write?

53:38.085 --> 53:39.723
I'm researching a
book at the moment.

53:39.725 --> 53:42.003
Well ghostwriting actually.

53:42.005 --> 53:44.525
The original author
lost the plot.

53:45.125 --> 53:46.362
What's his name?

53:46.364 --> 53:48.203
Avelin Eldridge.

53:48.205 --> 53:50.922
Oh yes, yes I remember him.

53:50.924 --> 53:55.244
He was here about what, oh
seven years ago, poking about.

53:56.244 --> 53:58.964
He asked lots of questions.

53:59.764 --> 54:01.882
The book's called The
Legend of the Black Flowers.

54:01.884 --> 54:05.123
Oh a legend's always
based on something,

54:05.125 --> 54:07.284
nothing is truly original.

54:08.404 --> 54:10.725
Yeah well it's
a shame he died.

54:11.485 --> 54:14.525
- Dead, certainly not dead.
- What?

54:15.764 --> 54:18.523
Mad as a hatter I'll
grant you that,

54:18.525 --> 54:20.605
but he's certainly not dead.

54:31.605 --> 54:34.083
You must prepare
yourself Eternity.

54:34.085 --> 54:36.043
I know you can be strong.

54:36.045 --> 54:38.282
Beware the monster
in the forest,

54:38.284 --> 54:40.922
you must protect
yourself from him.

54:40.924 --> 54:43.322
He can be very, very nasty,

54:43.324 --> 54:46.643
and there are some really
really bad things in woods.

54:46.645 --> 54:50.603
So I need you to be a big girl,

54:50.605 --> 54:54.083
look after yourself
and look after Daddy.

55:03.045 --> 55:07.565
- Who is it?
- It's Daisy, the babysitter.

55:07.804 --> 55:09.203
I'm not a baby.

55:09.205 --> 55:13.085
The young lady sitter
then, is that better?

55:19.565 --> 55:23.325
Acceptable I suppose,
you may come in.

55:26.284 --> 55:28.163
I've seen you before.

55:28.165 --> 55:30.003
Your dad's
friends with my mom.

55:30.005 --> 55:31.442
I live in the next house.

55:31.444 --> 55:32.922
Where's your dad?

55:32.924 --> 55:34.284
He, he ran away.

55:35.645 --> 55:37.723
I don't really need a sitter.

55:37.725 --> 55:39.083
Oh.

55:39.085 --> 55:41.244
- No?
- No.

55:41.844 --> 55:44.484
Don't you get bored
here on your own?

55:45.005 --> 55:47.723
No, only boring
people get bored.

55:47.725 --> 55:49.444
What did you do to your arm?

55:49.844 --> 55:52.044
I got cut.

55:52.324 --> 55:53.605
Can I see?

55:55.284 --> 55:57.003
Why?

55:57.005 --> 56:02.605
- Because I want to.
- No, maybe later.

56:06.685 --> 56:10.565
So, why are you called Eternity?

56:11.964 --> 56:15.123
Because I'll still be here
when you die.

56:38.284 --> 56:39.045
Jack.

56:43.804 --> 56:44.882
Sykes.

56:44.884 --> 56:46.364
Storms coming up.

56:49.205 --> 56:51.203
Strange events going on.

56:51.205 --> 56:53.643
Yeah, missing people,
police were around.

56:53.645 --> 56:54.725
I saw them.

56:58.605 --> 57:00.885
Heard you're writing a book.

57:02.525 --> 57:03.605
Did ya?

57:04.165 --> 57:05.645
Mary said.

57:07.165 --> 57:08.844
What's it about?

57:11.525 --> 57:14.645
It's about the legend
of the black flowers.

57:18.244 --> 57:19.484
Legend.

57:23.085 --> 57:24.603
Do you know about it?

57:24.605 --> 57:27.922
In the heart of every forest

57:27.924 --> 57:30.205
grows a black flower.

57:32.205 --> 57:35.483
Yeah, I'm looking for it now,

57:35.485 --> 57:36.842
following up on some leads.

57:36.844 --> 57:38.764
Old stories Jack.

57:40.324 --> 57:46.844
I wouldn't worry about it if
I was you, best forgotten.

58:29.605 --> 58:32.603
I don't know how to spell
any long words, it's not fair.

58:32.605 --> 58:36.483
Yeah, you're
completely rubbish.

58:36.485 --> 58:37.842
No I'm not, you are.

58:37.844 --> 58:39.683
Four letters, is that
the best you can do?

58:39.685 --> 58:41.282
It's a
better word than yours.

59:03.125 --> 59:04.565
Look.

59:06.565 --> 59:08.842
I've got this friend Jadis,

59:08.844 --> 59:10.362
she's a psychic.

59:10.364 --> 59:11.643
Do you want me to
get her around,

59:11.645 --> 59:15.485
see if she can help sort
this shit, stuff out?

59:42.605 --> 59:43.965
Mr. Eldridge?

59:54.884 --> 59:57.444
I'm Jack Winter, I'm,

59:59.364 --> 01:00:03.123
working on finishing
your book The...

01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:07.405
- Legend of the Black Flowers.
- Yeah.

01:00:08.725 --> 01:00:13.083
You're not the first and you
certainly won't be the last.

01:00:13.085 --> 01:00:14.442
I was just wondering if...

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.725
Hey, the book.

01:00:19.364 --> 01:00:23.683
The problem Jack
is that it's all true

01:00:23.685 --> 01:00:25.764
though no one will believe you.

01:00:27.685 --> 01:00:29.045
Look at the map.

01:00:30.244 --> 01:00:33.683
See these isolated
items in the woodland?

01:00:33.685 --> 01:00:36.483
In the middle of each
hidden in the ground

01:00:36.485 --> 01:00:39.723
is a black flower rune stone.

01:00:39.725 --> 01:00:43.362
In the middle of the
largest oldest one

01:00:43.364 --> 01:00:46.402
is a flower of great strength

01:00:46.404 --> 01:00:50.364
in a small copse, it's
the size of an old penny,

01:00:52.525 --> 01:00:55.003
created by the
spirits of the forest

01:00:55.005 --> 01:00:59.605
to keep the forest and all
its denizens safe from harm.

01:01:02.804 --> 01:01:06.764
And what do these
black flowers do?

01:01:08.645 --> 01:01:13.483
They send out a message,
makes men want to leave

01:01:13.485 --> 01:01:16.885
and eventually people move away.

01:01:18.725 --> 01:01:21.242
But as long as the
black flower stays there

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:23.525
the forest will last forever.

01:01:25.045 --> 01:01:29.402
And what happens if the
black flower is taken?

01:01:29.404 --> 01:01:31.282
Then men arrive
with their axes

01:01:31.284 --> 01:01:35.444
and the forest will be lost,
such is the curse of mankind.

01:01:37.804 --> 01:01:39.083
And the forest will do

01:01:39.085 --> 01:01:42.205
whatever it takes to
get the flowers back.

01:01:42.565 --> 01:01:43.962
Like what?

01:01:43.964 --> 01:01:45.604
Mr. Eldridge.

01:01:47.485 --> 01:01:50.842
Like summoning
up the horned god.

01:02:01.165 --> 01:02:02.725
Who are you?

01:02:03.964 --> 01:02:05.484
Jadis.

01:02:06.244 --> 01:02:07.402
That's a funny name.

01:02:07.404 --> 01:02:09.483
Jadis was a famous witch,

01:02:09.485 --> 01:02:11.603
the queen of all the witches

01:02:11.605 --> 01:02:14.563
and do you know the
thing about witches?

01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:15.442
No.

01:02:15.444 --> 01:02:18.244
A real witch can never die.

01:02:19.125 --> 01:02:22.123
Hey Daisy, how it's going,
need any shrooms?

01:02:22.125 --> 01:02:24.645
No thanks, I'm off them.

01:02:30.645 --> 01:02:33.523
Don't be afraid,
most witches are good

01:02:33.525 --> 01:02:36.685
and most hauntings
are easily explained.

01:02:38.804 --> 01:02:42.484
However, can feel
some bad energy here.

01:02:44.404 --> 01:02:46.924
It's cold, this place is old.

01:02:48.525 --> 01:02:51.925
- Well obviously.
- And haunted.

01:02:52.605 --> 01:02:54.723
Can feel at least
one ghost here,

01:02:54.725 --> 01:02:59.083
a restless spirit, I can feel
its emotions screaming out.

01:02:59.085 --> 01:03:01.123
It's trying to stop something,

01:03:01.125 --> 01:03:03.085
to make something right.

01:03:06.764 --> 01:03:09.483
Every ghost has a
reason to haunt.

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:13.965
Some are lonely, some are
stuck, some just bored.

01:03:14.924 --> 01:03:17.683
I mean if you were dead,

01:03:17.685 --> 01:03:23.764
died painfully or violently
what would you do?

01:03:24.125 --> 01:03:28.523
I would constantly be
trying to communicate.

01:03:28.525 --> 01:03:29.483
What's that for?

01:03:29.485 --> 01:03:31.365
It's called smudging.

01:03:33.205 --> 01:03:36.962
Ghosts don't like the
smell of burned sage.

01:03:48.565 --> 01:03:51.922
Rest assured he's
coming for you.

01:03:51.924 --> 01:03:53.563
Who's coming for me?

01:03:53.565 --> 01:03:57.523
The horned god of course,
the protector of the forest.

01:03:57.525 --> 01:04:00.605
You don't believe
that, gods are real?

01:04:11.165 --> 01:04:13.205
Spooky, cool.

01:04:28.525 --> 01:04:32.565
All right, you're
scaring her and me.

01:04:40.125 --> 01:04:42.764
Cards communicate
in many ways.

01:05:02.364 --> 01:05:04.882
The horned god is eternal.

01:05:04.884 --> 01:05:07.203
He's always been with
us and always will be.

01:05:07.205 --> 01:05:09.404
He is eternity.

01:05:10.205 --> 01:05:12.322
You think technology
will save you now?

01:05:12.324 --> 01:05:15.085
It's too late, too
late, too late.

01:05:25.804 --> 01:05:27.322
Are you okay?

01:05:27.324 --> 01:05:30.564
God.

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:36.882
Is that ectoplasm?

01:05:36.884 --> 01:05:41.844
No it's sick, I've never
had anything like this before.

01:05:42.444 --> 01:05:44.962
You can keep the tarot deck.

01:05:44.964 --> 01:05:46.123
There's a whole new hell

01:05:46.125 --> 01:05:49.762
coming to your
doorstep for Eternity.

01:05:49.764 --> 01:05:53.442
What do you mean,
hell for Eternity?

01:05:53.444 --> 01:05:55.844
Your daughter's name isn't it?

01:05:56.764 --> 01:05:59.762
He's coming for your daughter.

01:05:59.764 --> 01:06:01.603
No Eternity.

01:06:01.605 --> 01:06:05.764
It's not a legend, it's a
curse.

01:06:10.764 --> 01:06:14.842
Nobody finishes my
fucking book but me!

01:06:37.444 --> 01:06:42.684
Dead, no not dead,
your Dad's not dead.

01:06:51.924 --> 01:06:55.603
Good evening, Winter residence,
who's speaking please?

01:06:55.605 --> 01:06:56.683
- Eternity.
- Hi.

01:06:56.685 --> 01:06:57.802
It's Dad.

01:06:57.804 --> 01:06:59.362
I know, I
recognize your voice.

01:06:59.364 --> 01:07:00.322
Okay.

01:07:00.324 --> 01:07:02.884
- Daisy is here.
- Put her on.

01:07:06.324 --> 01:07:08.282
- Hi.
- Daisy hi.

01:07:08.284 --> 01:07:10.683
Look I'm having a bit of
a nightmare all right,

01:07:10.685 --> 01:07:11.762
I'm gonna be hours...

01:07:11.764 --> 01:07:14.882
- 100 quid to stay all night.
- 100 quid?

01:07:14.884 --> 01:07:18.324
- Oh all right, all right.
- Good.

01:07:18.844 --> 01:07:22.083
And feel free to tip 'cause
your house is scary as,

01:07:22.085 --> 01:07:25.043
well, pretty scary.

01:07:25.045 --> 01:07:28.885
Just be good okay,
I'll be as quick as I can.

01:07:34.324 --> 01:07:38.364
Thank god they keep these
phone boxes working, yeah.

01:07:46.924 --> 01:07:49.282
Get out of my room!

01:07:53.844 --> 01:07:56.842
- What happened?
- There was a monster.

01:07:56.844 --> 01:07:58.123
It's okay.

01:07:58.125 --> 01:08:00.802
I'm gonna look after you, yeah.

01:08:15.204 --> 01:08:17.002
I'm scared.

01:08:17.004 --> 01:08:20.403
We'll be okay in here,
I've made it monster proof.

01:08:20.404 --> 01:08:21.962
Monsters can't cross salt.

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:24.801
- Like slugs?
- It's the same.

01:08:24.804 --> 01:08:26.964
It's to do with the slime.

01:08:34.044 --> 01:08:36.725
Just five minutes, all right.

01:09:08.004 --> 01:09:09.363
Really?

01:09:09.365 --> 01:09:12.645
I'm coming in,
coming in, I'm coming.

01:09:16.004 --> 01:09:17.603
Come here, oh.

01:09:18.964 --> 01:09:19.962
Eloise!

01:09:52.964 --> 01:09:53.725
Come on.

01:10:03.004 --> 01:10:04.002
Damn.

01:10:04.004 --> 01:10:06.444
- What should we do?
- Don't know.

01:10:07.645 --> 01:10:10.042
My phone's dead and
your power's still out.

01:10:10.044 --> 01:10:11.804
Why don't you use our phone?

01:10:12.164 --> 01:10:14.002
All my numbers
are in this one.

01:10:14.004 --> 01:10:18.804
Look Eternity I'm
gonna go get my mom,

01:10:19.605 --> 01:10:21.802
she'll know what to do.

01:10:21.804 --> 01:10:23.962
You're gonna stay here okay?

01:10:23.964 --> 01:10:25.042
I think you'll be all
right in the daylight,

01:10:25.044 --> 01:10:26.363
but you have to promise me

01:10:26.365 --> 01:10:28.363
you're gonna stay
inside the house.

01:10:28.365 --> 01:10:30.162
Okay.

01:10:30.164 --> 01:10:31.725
Be right back.

01:10:42.964 --> 01:10:46.525
Bullets, bullets, bullets,
how do I make bullets?

01:10:52.204 --> 01:10:53.762
Dad.

01:10:57.764 --> 01:10:59.082
- Daddy!
- Eternity!

01:10:59.084 --> 01:11:00.443
I was
worried about you.

01:11:00.445 --> 01:11:02.884
- Jinx.
- Where's Daisy?

01:11:03.485 --> 01:11:05.882
We saw a monster,
it had horns.

01:11:05.884 --> 01:11:08.162
I whacked it with my spade.

01:11:08.164 --> 01:11:09.483
Daisy's gone to get her mom

01:11:09.485 --> 01:11:13.405
'cause she know what to
do and you weren't here.

01:11:13.924 --> 01:11:17.124
Dad, I closed the door.

01:11:46.164 --> 01:11:47.523
What?

01:11:47.525 --> 01:11:49.762
No I don't want any bloody
insurance, piss off.

01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:51.004
Dad.

01:12:00.884 --> 01:12:02.122
- Dad.
- Yeah?

01:12:02.124 --> 01:12:04.964
It's in my room,
I can feel it.

01:12:26.725 --> 01:12:28.804
- Dad.
- What?

01:12:29.365 --> 01:12:31.243
Under the bed.

01:13:15.204 --> 01:13:17.802
Oh god, what're
you doing here?

01:13:17.804 --> 01:13:19.443
Look I've been
checking things out.

01:13:19.445 --> 01:13:20.363
We've been on the internet.

01:13:20.365 --> 01:13:21.882
How come you live here?

01:13:21.884 --> 01:13:23.002
Well it's our home.

01:13:23.004 --> 01:13:24.563
Yeah but why here?

01:13:24.565 --> 01:13:26.643
Now how did you end
up in this place?

01:13:26.645 --> 01:13:28.243
It's been in the
family for generations,

01:13:28.245 --> 01:13:30.202
it's an old charter,
someone has to live here,

01:13:30.204 --> 01:13:31.443
like a guardian.

01:13:31.445 --> 01:13:34.202
What is it, what
is this house?

01:13:34.204 --> 01:13:35.922
- It's a gatehouse.
- You sure?

01:13:35.924 --> 01:13:39.283
Yeah, there's been a
gatehouse on this site for,

01:13:39.285 --> 01:13:41.002
well since the Roman times.

01:13:41.004 --> 01:13:42.162
2,000 years.

01:13:42.164 --> 01:13:44.162
Well what's it a gatehouse to?

01:13:44.164 --> 01:13:46.002
It's a gatehouse to the...

01:13:46.004 --> 01:13:48.323
There's no castle
or stately home.

01:13:48.325 --> 01:13:50.925
It's a gatehouse to the forest.

01:13:51.445 --> 01:13:54.082
Or it's not a
gatehouse, it's a...

01:13:54.084 --> 01:13:55.764
- Mausoleum.
- A tomb.

01:13:56.884 --> 01:13:58.483
- You said guardian?
- Yeah.

01:13:58.485 --> 01:14:03.882
What are you guarding,
maybe it's a prison or a safe.

01:14:03.884 --> 01:14:05.124
A vault.

01:14:06.725 --> 01:14:09.683
- Is there a basement?
- No.

01:14:09.685 --> 01:14:11.483
- No there's no basement here.
- You sure?

01:14:11.485 --> 01:14:12.842
- Yep I lived here...
- What's in there?

01:14:12.844 --> 01:14:14.042
Nothing's in there.

01:14:14.044 --> 01:14:15.202
Oh leave that Daisy.

01:14:15.204 --> 01:14:17.283
There's nothing in there,
it's just junk and stuff,

01:14:17.285 --> 01:14:19.243
please leave that,
oh come on out,

01:14:19.245 --> 01:14:21.283
I just put that, Daisy.

01:14:21.285 --> 01:14:23.802
Honestly Daisy
please don't do that,

01:14:23.804 --> 01:14:25.363
please just put that back.

01:14:25.365 --> 01:14:26.283
I've lived here for 10 years.

01:14:26.285 --> 01:14:28.405
- What's that then?
- Nothing.

01:14:30.405 --> 01:14:31.525
Really?

01:14:32.924 --> 01:14:35.284
Looks like a basement to me.

01:14:49.605 --> 01:14:52.283
How old do you
reckon this place is?

01:14:52.285 --> 01:14:55.802
It's at least as old
as the house, even older.

01:14:55.804 --> 01:15:00.122
This could be part of the
original Roman foundations.

01:15:02.764 --> 01:15:04.643
- Daisy.
- Sorry cobwebs.

01:15:04.645 --> 01:15:06.405
Oh.

01:15:09.325 --> 01:15:12.283
Sorry, sorry.

01:15:12.285 --> 01:15:13.845
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:15:28.245 --> 01:15:30.125
Ah, mind your head.

01:15:35.204 --> 01:15:36.244
Guys.

01:15:40.605 --> 01:15:41.804
Look.

01:15:49.804 --> 01:15:50.844
Wait.

01:15:53.445 --> 01:15:54.485
Swap.

01:15:56.004 --> 01:15:57.084
Yeah.

01:16:01.164 --> 01:16:03.725
Okay, one,

01:16:04.924 --> 01:16:05.924
two,

01:16:06.565 --> 01:16:07.565
three.

01:16:13.285 --> 01:16:14.323
Wow.

01:16:14.325 --> 01:16:15.563
The Romans must've
built this place

01:16:15.565 --> 01:16:18.323
to protect the
main black flower.

01:16:18.325 --> 01:16:19.842
They must've all got fed up

01:16:19.844 --> 01:16:21.363
with monsters in their bedroom.

01:16:22.645 --> 01:16:24.962
The gatehouse is
guarding the forest,

01:16:24.964 --> 01:16:26.762
but it's not a gate
to their world,

01:16:26.764 --> 01:16:28.403
it's a gate stop and
it's fucking with it.

01:16:28.405 --> 01:16:29.445
Language.

01:16:30.445 --> 01:16:31.285
I'm cold.

01:16:32.325 --> 01:16:35.363
Well, there's
nothing else here

01:16:35.365 --> 01:16:37.844
and this place stinks of death.

01:16:38.764 --> 01:16:39.882
Then let's go.

01:16:39.884 --> 01:16:41.565
Yeah, let's.

01:16:53.204 --> 01:16:54.244
Eternity!

01:16:56.164 --> 01:16:58.002
What are you doing here?

01:16:58.004 --> 01:16:59.443
Door was open, no one about,

01:16:59.445 --> 01:17:01.243
I wondered what was going on.

01:17:01.245 --> 01:17:03.925
- Oh hello Algernon.
- Mary.

01:17:06.245 --> 01:17:07.605
Algernon.

01:17:08.004 --> 01:17:09.964
What's that you got there?

01:17:11.924 --> 01:17:14.244
You know what
that is don't you?

01:17:15.204 --> 01:17:18.002
Look, we've got the
black flower rune stone

01:17:18.004 --> 01:17:19.563
and the horned god has
come to take it back

01:17:19.565 --> 01:17:21.042
are you gonna help us

01:17:21.044 --> 01:17:24.124
or just stand there
like a big pile of poo?

01:17:26.804 --> 01:17:30.204
- Is this some sort of joke?
- No.

01:17:34.164 --> 01:17:36.204
Big pile of poo.

01:17:39.124 --> 01:17:42.962
See here, we're at the center
of all the black flowers.

01:17:42.964 --> 01:17:45.403
The gatehouse must be the
original heart of the forest

01:17:45.405 --> 01:17:48.882
when it was all one
thousands of years ago.

01:17:48.884 --> 01:17:52.122
Eldridge's notes,
he's got people move away

01:17:52.124 --> 01:17:54.004
underlined all over it.

01:17:55.285 --> 01:17:57.802
- People move away.
- People move away.

01:17:57.804 --> 01:18:00.363
- People move away.
- People move away.

01:18:00.365 --> 01:18:04.605
And eventually
people move away.

01:18:04.804 --> 01:18:06.162
People move away.

01:18:06.164 --> 01:18:07.842
It's the black
flower rune stones,

01:18:07.844 --> 01:18:10.122
they're sending out a message.

01:18:10.124 --> 01:18:12.042
Leave us alone, move away.

01:18:12.044 --> 01:18:16.162
And when they're gone
people can destroy the forest.

01:18:16.164 --> 01:18:17.882
We've got to give them back.

01:18:17.884 --> 01:18:20.044
We've got to face him.

01:18:20.445 --> 01:18:24.165
Best form of defense is attack.

01:18:26.884 --> 01:18:28.204
Come on then.

01:18:51.565 --> 01:18:56.483
Hey, who's to gain from the
destruction of the forest?

01:18:56.485 --> 01:18:59.243
He's been expanding
his farm for years,

01:18:59.245 --> 01:19:00.283
plowing over the woods and trees

01:19:00.285 --> 01:19:03.523
like it's going out of fashion.

01:19:03.525 --> 01:19:04.762
Where are we going?

01:19:04.764 --> 01:19:07.042
To fight the
forces of darkness.

01:19:07.044 --> 01:19:10.403
Is it wise for your child to
fight the forces of darkness?

01:19:10.405 --> 01:19:15.405
I'm not a child, I'm 10,
and 10 is a magic number.

01:19:15.605 --> 01:19:17.042
Can't argue with that.

01:19:17.044 --> 01:19:22.082
10 fingers, 10 toes,
10 planets, 10 commandments,

01:19:22.084 --> 01:19:25.403
10 out of 10, 10 pennies
and the decimal system

01:19:25.405 --> 01:19:29.323
and in ancient Rome
decimate means to kill

01:19:29.325 --> 01:19:33.683
every 10th legionnaire,
decimate 10.

01:19:33.685 --> 01:19:35.884
- Okay, okay.
- 10.

01:19:36.365 --> 01:19:37.643
I get the idea.

01:19:37.645 --> 01:19:39.563
Who says it's from
the darkness anyway?

01:19:39.565 --> 01:19:41.004
Your dead friend.

01:19:44.525 --> 01:19:45.563
You know a lot.

01:19:45.565 --> 01:19:47.483
Been watching you.

01:19:47.485 --> 01:19:52.002
Keeping my ears open,
put two and two together.

01:19:52.004 --> 01:19:54.842
He just wants to live,
what's so evil about that?

01:19:54.844 --> 01:19:56.683
It's the way he wants to live,

01:19:56.685 --> 01:20:01.882
skulking about in the
darkness, scaring people.

01:20:01.884 --> 01:20:08.244
He's right and no one
scares my daughter except me.

01:20:13.365 --> 01:20:14.643
- Hawthorn?
- Yeah,

01:20:14.645 --> 01:20:17.525
the best wood for
fighting the undead.

01:20:31.924 --> 01:20:34.042
What'd you do that for?

01:20:34.044 --> 01:20:36.685
Bit jumpy, sorry.

01:20:47.645 --> 01:20:52.762
Oh this is ridiculous,
what are we doing here?

01:20:52.764 --> 01:20:55.325
Let me see the black flower.

01:21:07.685 --> 01:21:09.842
It's leading the way.

01:21:44.124 --> 01:21:45.444
Poppy!

01:21:48.044 --> 01:21:49.244
Poppy.

01:21:49.964 --> 01:21:51.404
Help me.

01:21:52.804 --> 01:21:54.244
Help me.

01:21:54.685 --> 01:21:57.245
What the hell?

01:21:59.685 --> 01:22:01.723
Are you okay?

01:22:01.725 --> 01:22:04.685
Oh, we'll get you out.

01:22:05.325 --> 01:22:08.925
- Are you okay?
- Help me, help me.

01:22:09.565 --> 01:22:11.685
Please, I don't feel so good.

01:22:11.884 --> 01:22:13.443
We'll get you out of the tree.

01:22:13.445 --> 01:22:16.842
I don't think
you can, I'm part tree now.

01:22:16.844 --> 01:22:18.202
We've got an ax.

01:22:18.204 --> 01:22:21.924
No, I'm a poppy tree.

01:22:41.804 --> 01:22:43.485
Shit, not dreaming.

01:22:53.924 --> 01:22:56.685
He's the one who
did this to me.

01:22:57.884 --> 01:22:58.964
Come on.

01:23:00.884 --> 01:23:03.084
Oh my god.

01:23:06.685 --> 01:23:07.884
Hi.

01:23:08.804 --> 01:23:10.124
Hi.

01:23:11.924 --> 01:23:14.284
Black flower.

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:18.004
All right.

01:23:21.245 --> 01:23:23.523
I think this is yours.

01:23:23.525 --> 01:23:27.125
No, no don't give
it to that thing.

01:23:27.764 --> 01:23:28.603
No!

01:23:31.804 --> 01:23:33.164
Oh my god.

01:23:34.525 --> 01:23:38.165
You're an aberration.

01:23:45.084 --> 01:23:46.364
Oh no.

01:23:52.245 --> 01:23:54.683
Eternity come here.

01:23:54.685 --> 01:23:57.565
Give me that, do you hear me?

01:23:58.245 --> 01:23:59.882
Run.

01:23:59.884 --> 01:24:01.523
What are you doing
Sykes come on.

01:24:01.525 --> 01:24:02.882
Sykes come on.

01:24:20.445 --> 01:24:23.764
No, please don't hurt us, no.

01:24:27.645 --> 01:24:28.725
Just take it.

01:25:28.964 --> 01:25:33.605
Where are you,
you bleeding conker?

01:25:43.605 --> 01:25:48.245
Come out, come out
wherever you are?

01:25:50.084 --> 01:25:52.444
Come out, come out.

01:25:56.924 --> 01:26:00.244
I can see you.

01:26:02.405 --> 01:26:04.764
Got you girlie.

01:26:37.924 --> 01:26:39.324
Daddy.

01:26:40.685 --> 01:26:44.044
Daddy are you okay, Daddy?

01:26:51.084 --> 01:26:54.243
Go away, go away!

01:26:54.245 --> 01:26:57.082
Leave us alone,
this is all your fault.

01:26:57.084 --> 01:26:59.802
I'm gonna cut off your head
and bury it upside down

01:26:59.804 --> 01:27:02.204
then you'll never come back.

01:27:02.685 --> 01:27:04.443
You think you can just
come into my woods

01:27:04.445 --> 01:27:06.884
and start bossing us around?

01:27:07.325 --> 01:27:09.643
I call on the gods
of ancient Rome,

01:27:09.645 --> 01:27:10.962
help me have vengeance.

01:27:10.964 --> 01:27:13.443
They'll obliterate you.

01:27:13.445 --> 01:27:15.603
I command my undead
army of Roman archers

01:27:15.605 --> 01:27:18.122
to protect me from
this nasty god.

01:27:18.124 --> 01:27:20.244
Let there be war!

01:27:50.365 --> 01:27:53.283
Save the forest.

01:27:53.285 --> 01:27:55.085
Kill the beast.

01:27:55.804 --> 01:27:57.884
Kill the monster.

01:28:02.124 --> 01:28:04.124
Save the forest.

01:28:08.044 --> 01:28:12.204
Give me that black flower now.

01:28:14.245 --> 01:28:16.925
You shot my dad.

01:28:17.164 --> 01:28:22.164
Oh it was an accident, I was
aiming at that demon thing.

01:28:27.725 --> 01:28:29.764
You're just greedy.

01:28:31.325 --> 01:28:33.042
He's just trying to
protect his home,

01:28:33.044 --> 01:28:35.122
the forest, the place he loves.

01:28:35.124 --> 01:28:39.084
You cheeky little
monkey.

01:28:46.004 --> 01:28:49.603
I hope it hurts when you die.

01:29:04.044 --> 01:29:06.563
- Save the forest.
- Kill the monster.

01:29:15.325 --> 01:29:18.523
Return the black
flowers to the forest,

01:29:18.525 --> 01:29:21.485
back to the Earth
where they belong.

01:29:32.645 --> 01:29:34.884
Daddy, Daddy.

01:29:37.285 --> 01:29:39.685
Daddy, Daddy.

01:29:46.004 --> 01:29:47.202
Dad I did it.

01:29:47.204 --> 01:29:50.202
You know, you know why
you're called Eternity?

01:29:50.204 --> 01:29:51.564
No.

01:29:53.844 --> 01:29:57.725
Because when you were
born it was perfect

01:29:58.485 --> 01:30:01.605
and I wanted it to
last for an Eternity.

01:30:03.764 --> 01:30:05.565
Daddy, Daddy.

01:30:08.844 --> 01:30:12.044
No you can't leave, don't go.

01:30:12.365 --> 01:30:18.085
Daddy, daddy please,
please don't go Daddy.

01:30:22.445 --> 01:30:24.205
No Daddy.

01:30:25.844 --> 01:30:26.762
Daddy.

01:30:32.245 --> 01:30:34.563
I've got to pack it right.

01:30:49.325 --> 01:30:51.643
I've cleaned you up
as best as I can.

01:30:51.645 --> 01:30:54.683
Got to have you
looking good for Mom.

01:31:24.164 --> 01:31:26.124
You got what you wanted.

01:31:33.964 --> 01:31:36.244
Help me, help.

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:40.283
- Where is it?
- Oh, what's happening?

01:31:40.285 --> 01:31:42.683
Dad's going to the next world.

01:31:42.685 --> 01:31:44.445

01:32:36.204 --> 01:32:40.924
For Eternity, for me

01:32:52.645 --> 01:32:54.563
Okay, it's okay.

01:32:54.565 --> 01:32:55.882
Daddy.

01:32:55.884 --> 01:32:58.922
Eternity I am

01:32:58.924 --> 01:33:00.162
I'm gonna be a better dad

01:33:00.164 --> 01:33:03.443
and I am never gonna
leave you again.

01:33:07.884 --> 01:33:11.363
Once upon a time there was
a little girl called Eternity

01:33:11.365 --> 01:33:13.683
who used to burp
when she got scared

01:33:13.685 --> 01:33:15.603
who lived in a haunted gatehouse

01:33:15.605 --> 01:33:17.683
at the edge of an ancient forest

01:33:17.685 --> 01:33:20.483
with her dad, her stepmom Mary

01:33:20.485 --> 01:33:22.403
and her stepsister called Daisy

01:33:22.405 --> 01:33:25.565
and no one could ever
take it from them.

01:33:27.605 --> 01:33:29.685
The end.

01:35:23.764 --> 01:35:25.683
Look the book's 80% done.

01:35:25.685 --> 01:35:27.683
I just need you to tart
it up, finish it off,

01:35:27.685 --> 01:35:30.565
put it to bed, give it 110%.

01:35:31.525 --> 01:35:33.605
You can ghostwrite, right?
