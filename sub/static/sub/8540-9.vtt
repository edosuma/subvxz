12:40.672 --> 12:44.154
No, I do, just not here,
not on the job.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.416
We'll have to talk
about it sometime.

12:45.503 --> 12:47.331
Yeah. Soon.

12:49.290 --> 12:50.900
CBI.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.554
I'd like to know about
the, uh, resident

12:52.641 --> 12:54.338
who owns the blue beater there.

12:54.425 --> 12:59.169
Murphy? Pays his rent,
makes no trouble.

12:59.256 --> 13:01.084
What'd he do?

13:01.171 --> 13:03.652
Has he had any visitors
recently?

13:03.739 --> 13:07.047
No. Oh, wait.
Yeah, couple of hours ago.

13:07.134 --> 13:08.788
Big guy in a cowboy hat.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.180
Pimped out truck.

13:10.267 --> 13:13.227
Stayed...five minutes,
split.

13:13.314 --> 13:16.665
Does murphy's room have any
rear exit of any kind? A window?

13:16.752 --> 13:18.449
Nope.

13:18.536 --> 13:21.017
What did he do?

13:21.104 --> 13:22.453
Mr. Murphy?

13:22.540 --> 13:25.543
State agents.
We need to talk to you.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.504
Mr. Murphy?

13:32.159 --> 13:33.595
[door creaks]

13:33.682 --> 13:35.640
Mr. Murphy?

13:37.729 --> 13:39.862
Go.

13:39.949 --> 13:40.863
Clear.

13:49.741 --> 13:52.440
Guess that lets Carl Ward
off the hook then, huh?

14:08.021 --> 14:10.327
Ballistics owes me,
expedited the report.

14:10.414 --> 14:13.504
This gun was used to shoot
both Doyle Murphy and Carl Ward.

14:13.591 --> 14:14.941
There were no jewels
in the room or the car.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.899
No prints on the gun.

14:16.986 --> 14:19.771
Start going through all
of Murphy's known associates.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.251
We're looking for a cowboy
in a fancy truck.

14:21.338 --> 14:22.862
Kind of a thin trail.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.603
Murphy's a career criminal.
He has a lot of associates.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.475
Hmm.

14:27.562 --> 14:30.608
- Maybe I can help.
- Just maybe?

14:30.695 --> 14:33.002
Feeling unsure about yourself,
are you?

14:33.089 --> 14:35.048
Don't let one wrong hunch
throw you.

14:35.135 --> 14:38.051
Well, A, we don't know yet
that I'm wrong about Ward.

14:38.138 --> 14:41.271
And B, bring
the motel desk clerk in.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.534
Maybe he can recall a little
more detail than he thinks

14:43.621 --> 14:44.709
about this cowboy.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.800
[Patrick]
'Can you see him?'

14:48.888 --> 14:50.454
Yes.

14:50.541 --> 14:51.978
'What's he doing?'

14:52.065 --> 14:54.894
He's getting out
of the truck.

14:54.981 --> 14:59.768
And he's walking across
the forecourt to Murphy's room.

14:59.855 --> 15:03.163
Can you read the license plate
on the truck?

15:03.250 --> 15:04.207
No.

15:04.294 --> 15:05.295
Look closer.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.082
No, I can't. It's blocked.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.605
What's he wearing?

15:10.692 --> 15:12.389
Cowboy hat, brown.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.132
Black jeans.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.918
Sunglasses, Aviator style.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.921
That's very good, Marty.

15:22.008 --> 15:25.098
What else can you see?

15:25.185 --> 15:27.970
He's wearing a t-shirt
with a Bulldog on the front.

15:28.057 --> 15:30.625
'under it, true blue.'

15:30.712 --> 15:32.801
[indistinct conversations]

15:39.677 --> 15:41.157
[instrumental music]

15:46.249 --> 15:50.123
[dog barks]

15:55.693 --> 15:58.261
Donald Culpepper?

15:58.348 --> 15:59.697
Who the hell are you?

16:01.656 --> 16:02.831
Tsst. Quiet.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.227
I have reason to believe that
you visited with Doyle Murphy

16:07.314 --> 16:10.273
at the Starlite motor court.
Is that correct?

16:10.360 --> 16:11.927
That's partially correct.

16:12.014 --> 16:14.451
I went to see him.
He wasn't there, so I left.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.627
Why'd you go see him?

16:16.714 --> 16:20.022
Social visit. Catchin' up.
He was married to my sister.

16:20.109 --> 16:23.373
We have sad news.
Your ex-brother-in-law is dead.

16:23.460 --> 16:24.896
I'm in shock.

16:26.463 --> 16:27.987
How'd that happen?

16:28.074 --> 16:31.512
He was shot. Any idea
who might want to do that?

16:31.599 --> 16:32.556
No.

16:32.643 --> 16:33.993
How about you?

16:34.080 --> 16:36.560
I have nothing but love
for Murph.

16:36.647 --> 16:37.953
Why would you think
otherwise?

16:38.040 --> 16:39.781
Well, because we read
your rap sheet.

16:39.868 --> 16:42.610
You're a professional criminal
implicated in several murders.

16:42.697 --> 16:46.092
I'm a dynamic businessman
who pushes the envelope.

16:46.179 --> 16:49.747
Anybody can imply anything. It's
another thing to make it stick.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.749
Yeah. Get out.

16:51.836 --> 16:54.361
We need to continue
this conversation downtown.

17:00.367 --> 17:01.498
Thanks.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.762
I deduce from the irritated tone
of your phone conversation

17:05.849 --> 17:09.070
that I was right
about Carl Ward.

17:09.157 --> 17:10.464
Half right.

17:10.550 --> 17:11.726
Go on.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.643
His real name's
Carl Wysowcki.

17:15.730 --> 17:17.819
He was in jail
for kiting checks.

17:17.906 --> 17:20.734
He's got an ex-wife
in Bayonne, New Jersey.

17:20.821 --> 17:24.565
She's owed $90,000
in back alimony.

17:24.652 --> 17:25.782
Half?

17:36.229 --> 17:39.232
So he changed his name.
What of it?

17:39.319 --> 17:41.016
Did you know about
the jail time?

17:41.103 --> 17:42.583
Yes, of course I did.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.237
And the ex-wife?

17:44.324 --> 17:46.065
Of course.
He told me everything.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.371
Hmm, liar.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.460
- Bad liar.
- How dare you.

17:50.547 --> 17:53.115
Well, it's a compliment
to your good character.

17:53.202 --> 17:56.466
You'd rather be a good liar?
Hmm?

17:58.251 --> 18:00.992
I knew everything
about Carl's past.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.733
We're glad he told you, ma'am

18:02.820 --> 18:04.909
because we have to consider
the possibility that he was

18:04.996 --> 18:08.435
somehow involved in the jewel
heist and double-crossed.

18:08.522 --> 18:11.655
His honesty with you makes him
far less of a suspect.

18:11.742 --> 18:14.876
Do you have anything further?
My husband needs me.

18:14.963 --> 18:16.443
No, ma'am. Thank you.

18:18.140 --> 18:22.188
- How's he doing?
- He'll live.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.103
They were going to bring him
out of sedation tomorrow.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.453
Excellent.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.168
[Cho]
'Why did you visit with
Doyle Murphy?'

18:46.255 --> 18:48.127
I didn't. He wasn't home.

18:49.824 --> 18:53.262
If he had been home,
what would you have said to him?

18:53.349 --> 18:54.959
Gimme my money.

18:55.046 --> 18:59.312
- He owed you. How much?
- 200 grand and change.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.705
He comes out of incarceration
this last bit he did

19:01.792 --> 19:03.490
and needed to go into rehab.

19:03.577 --> 19:06.928
Junkie son of a gun was there
over a month on my dime.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.408
That's very generous of you.

19:08.495 --> 19:11.324
Nah. What am I gonna do?

19:11.411 --> 19:12.716
At the time,
this was two years back

19:12.803 --> 19:15.502
he's married to my sister.
Moron.

19:15.589 --> 19:16.894
Then he kicks your sister
to the curb

19:16.981 --> 19:18.940
after some
domestic violence problems.

19:19.027 --> 19:21.072
And he still owes you 200 grand.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.032
One, my sister
is a goblin shark.

19:24.119 --> 19:26.295
Freakin' Gandhi would take
a pop at her.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.384
I got no beef with Doyle
over that, believe me.

19:28.471 --> 19:31.257
And two, this money
is what I'm telling ya.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.476
Why would I kill a guy who
owes me that much money?

19:33.563 --> 19:35.043
Because he just made
a very big score.

19:35.130 --> 19:37.350
- Is that right?
- Yes, it is.

19:37.437 --> 19:38.786
Maybe you decided to take
what was owed to you

19:38.873 --> 19:40.266
and a little bit more.

19:40.353 --> 19:41.919
What score is this?
Doverton's?

19:42.006 --> 19:45.967
- You heard about that.
- Was on the TV. Nice work.

19:46.054 --> 19:49.057
Doyle did that? Wow.

19:49.144 --> 19:50.885
Did you ever own a Beretta 950?

19:50.972 --> 19:53.496
As a matter of fact, I did
use to have one of those.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.194
I didn't like the balance.

19:55.281 --> 19:58.762
I sold it to Doyle, why?

19:58.849 --> 20:01.243
Hmm.

20:01.330 --> 20:04.725
Well, I don't care what you're
gonna say. I like him for it.

20:04.812 --> 20:06.857
What do you mean, you don't
care what I have to say?

20:06.944 --> 20:09.382
He's obvious, so you're gonna
say he's not the guy

20:09.469 --> 20:10.948
because, that would be boring.

20:11.035 --> 20:13.777
No, he looks good for it.
Superficially, at least.

20:13.864 --> 20:16.302
I was merely gonna state
that we need to find a link

20:16.389 --> 20:19.392
between him and Doyle
and someone inside Doverton's.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.307
I thought Carl Ward
was your man on the inside.

20:21.394 --> 20:24.788
No. I-I noted
that he was a tennis pro

20:24.875 --> 20:26.225
and extrapolated
from there.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.314
No. No, you said
he was the guy.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.489
Well, if you recall--

20:29.576 --> 20:31.142
Guys. I mean, Boss.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.754
I think I found the link
you're talking about.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.756
The old footage from
the store's security cameras

20:35.843 --> 20:37.323
is saved on a hard drive
off-site.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.499
I figured if Murphy
had been casing the store

20:39.586 --> 20:41.457
I could find him
on the old footage.

20:44.068 --> 20:46.593
- Who's that?
- I'll enhance it.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.899
[keys click]

20:48.986 --> 20:50.597
[Patrick]
'Hmm. Wow.'

20:50.684 --> 20:53.034
Tom Doverton.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.606
It's a customer, I guess.

20:59.693 --> 21:02.173
I'm talking to a customer.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.958
That's the man
who robbed your family store

21:04.045 --> 21:05.438
and shot your uncle.

21:05.525 --> 21:06.830
Are you sure
you don't know him?

21:06.917 --> 21:09.833
Because you're talking
like you're old friends.

21:09.920 --> 21:15.535
No. I'm just helpin' a customer
with their purchase. That's all.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.537
And you've never seen
that man before?

21:17.624 --> 21:19.016
No.

21:19.103 --> 21:23.325
And you don't know
the name Doyle Murphy?

21:23.412 --> 21:24.544
No.

21:26.415 --> 21:28.243
The kid's aunt and brother
are here with a lawyer.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.593
Darn. We haven't gotten
anywhere with him yet.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.595
You want me to stall 'em?

21:32.682 --> 21:35.816
It's best just to cut him loose.
He's denying everything anyway.

21:35.903 --> 21:37.470
Unless we can make
some connection

21:37.557 --> 21:39.602
to Culpepper and Doyle, we've
got nothing to hold him on.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.517
Okay.

21:41.604 --> 21:44.564
You go and ask Culpepper about
Tom, I'll deal with the family.

21:55.270 --> 21:56.793
You can take Tom home now.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.318
We just had a couple of
questions, we needed to ask him.

21:59.405 --> 22:00.797
What questions?

22:00.884 --> 22:04.192
I'm sure, he'll fill
you in on the details.

22:04.279 --> 22:06.194
Well, I'd appreciate it
if next time you wish

22:06.281 --> 22:10.677
to speak to a member of my
family, you call me first.

22:10.764 --> 22:13.506
I'm sorry, ma'am.
That's not our practice.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.423
Can I walk you
to the elevator?

22:17.510 --> 22:19.903
[instrumental music]

22:22.776 --> 22:24.995
You do know why I'm letting
you go, don't you?

22:25.082 --> 22:28.042
Let me guess.
I'm innocent.

22:28.129 --> 22:29.739
[Patrick chuckles]

22:29.826 --> 22:32.829
No, I figured
you're stupid.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.875
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.659
Either you really didn't know
that Doyle was gonna

22:36.746 --> 22:38.661
actually rob
the jewelry store..

22:38.748 --> 22:41.011
...stupid innocent.
Or you did know

22:41.098 --> 22:42.839
and you're gonna lead us
to a clue.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.101
Stupid guilty.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.410
You should be more careful
how you talk to people.

22:48.497 --> 22:51.195
Yeah, figure I'm
pretty safe here.

22:51.282 --> 22:52.458
I mean, what are you
gonna do?

22:53.981 --> 22:55.591
You think I care
where we are?

22:58.638 --> 23:00.030
Go ahead.

23:00.117 --> 23:02.903
Do something, you miserable
little sadist.

23:02.990 --> 23:05.079
Hello, Lisbon. Hi, Dovertons.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.385
What's going on, Jane?

23:06.472 --> 23:08.169
I'm just letting
Mr. Culpepper go.

23:08.256 --> 23:09.866
We don't need him
for anything, do we?

23:11.041 --> 23:12.739
- Do we?
- Sometime.

23:12.826 --> 23:15.089
When you least expect it..

23:15.176 --> 23:16.917
...I'll find you.

23:20.529 --> 23:22.488
- You, uh..
- Wait for the next one.

23:22.575 --> 23:24.533
Alright.

23:24.620 --> 23:27.188
So long, partner.
Happy trails.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.801
Okay, what the hell was that?

23:31.888 --> 23:33.934
- What was what?
- Letting Donny Culpepper go.

23:34.021 --> 23:36.980
You have no right, whatsoever,
to make those kind of decisions.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.634
Well, you weren't
gonna keep him here.

23:38.721 --> 23:42.029
On what? For what?
He wasn't gonna talk. Be honest.

23:42.116 --> 23:43.683
I could have held him
on the weapons charge.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.511
- Oh, please!
- Stop.

23:45.598 --> 23:48.035
There's principle involved.

23:48.122 --> 23:50.167
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

23:50.254 --> 23:52.039
What're you talking about?

23:52.126 --> 23:54.258
Showing the Dovertons to Donny
Culpepper. You wanted to see

23:54.345 --> 23:56.086
if he recognized
one of them, didn't you?

23:56.173 --> 23:58.088
You watch too much TV. I just
thought there was no reason

23:58.175 --> 23:59.829
to keep Donny Culpepper here.

23:59.916 --> 24:01.483
Now that's just annoying.
You're not even putting

24:01.570 --> 24:03.398
any effort into the lie.

24:03.485 --> 24:06.445
Hey, boss. Coroner's here.
She got something to show us.

24:08.403 --> 24:09.578
[instrumental music]

24:13.060 --> 24:17.194
Well...it's really beautiful.
Mm?

24:17.281 --> 24:20.502
I found it in Doyle Murphy's
lower intestine.

24:20.589 --> 24:22.809
My supposition is that he
swallowed it

24:22.896 --> 24:24.550
in an attempt to get a larger
share of the loot

24:24.637 --> 24:26.639
before it was divided
with any partners.

24:26.726 --> 24:29.337
Yeah, I guess Murphy
misread that situation, huh?

24:29.424 --> 24:30.904
Did you find anything else
surprising in there?

24:30.991 --> 24:32.775
- Other than that?
- Just that.

24:32.862 --> 24:34.037
[colleagues shrieking]

24:35.169 --> 24:36.562
What the hell was that?

24:37.214 --> 24:38.781
Uh, I..

24:38.868 --> 24:40.653
[Jane clears throat]

24:40.740 --> 24:44.004
...had a hunch
that it was a fake.

24:44.091 --> 24:46.702
- Guess I'm wrong about that.
- Uh, yeah.

24:47.790 --> 24:49.009
Where is it?

24:49.096 --> 24:50.837
Well, the good news is
it's not out there.

24:50.924 --> 24:54.014
So it's in here somewhere.
I'll find it.

24:55.363 --> 24:57.583
Anyone see a little, uh..

24:57.670 --> 24:58.888
[imitates ricocheting sound]

25:02.675 --> 25:03.589
Nope?

25:07.941 --> 25:09.290
There's gotta be a connection
between Doyle Murphy

25:09.377 --> 25:12.032
and Tom Doverton.
Yeah, but w-what was it?

25:12.119 --> 25:13.294
What would bring
those two together?

25:13.381 --> 25:14.643
They have nothing in common.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.340
- What are you guys looking for?
- A diamond.

25:16.427 --> 25:17.385
What did he do?

25:17.472 --> 25:19.126
Hit it with a fire extinguisher.

25:19.213 --> 25:20.693
- Of course.
- I got it!

25:20.780 --> 25:22.912
Oh, thank God.
Where was it?

25:22.999 --> 25:25.045
No, I got
where Doyle and Tom connect.

25:25.132 --> 25:27.221
- Doyle was in rehab.
- Yes.

25:27.308 --> 25:29.789
And Tom Doverton does
look the rehab type.

25:29.876 --> 25:33.619
Van Pelt, find out where Doyle
went to rehab. Keep looking.

25:33.706 --> 25:36.056
Don't worry.
This is justice department.

25:36.143 --> 25:39.059
- Who's gonna steal it here?
- You be quiet!

25:42.932 --> 25:45.326
[muttering indistinctly]

25:47.633 --> 25:50.766
Windward Clarity has the highest
ratio of staff-to-patient

25:50.853 --> 25:53.029
of any facility
in the state.

25:53.116 --> 25:55.641
Our philosophy mixes
traditional western practices

25:55.728 --> 25:58.731
with spiritual aspects
of the East.

25:58.818 --> 26:01.777
Now, may I ask which one of you
needs our help

26:01.864 --> 26:03.344
or is it both of you?

26:03.431 --> 26:05.215
- Actually, we just wanted--
- It's her.

26:05.302 --> 26:07.391
- No.
- Oh, darling, please.

26:07.478 --> 26:10.438
Can we, just this once, do it
my way? Just once.

26:11.134 --> 26:12.832
Thank you.

26:12.919 --> 26:15.704
In the beginning,
it was just social but..

26:15.791 --> 26:18.925
...well, more recently..

26:19.012 --> 26:21.275
...it's been starting
to worry both of us.

26:21.362 --> 26:22.537
Right, darling?

26:24.713 --> 26:26.497
Right this way.
I'll introduce you to one of our

26:26.585 --> 26:27.760
intake specialists.

26:27.847 --> 26:29.500
Fantastic.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.939
Oh, uh, that's the office.
I'm gonna have to take this.

26:33.026 --> 26:34.897
Uh, baby, you go ahead,
take a look.

26:34.984 --> 26:37.030
I'll be five minutes.
I'll be right there.

26:37.117 --> 26:38.248
Look after her.

26:39.336 --> 26:40.860
I'm very proud of you.

26:40.947 --> 26:43.297
- I understand your nervousness.
- I love you.

26:43.384 --> 26:45.168
[Dr. Joseph]
'It's completely natural.'

26:45.255 --> 26:47.606
'But you've already taken
the first step in recognizing..'

26:55.178 --> 26:56.353
[telephone ringing]

26:58.007 --> 26:59.574
[instrumental music]

27:38.482 --> 27:41.442
Our kitchen is capable
of preparing food for any diet.

27:41.529 --> 27:46.403
And of course, we have a pair
of on-site nutritionists.

27:46.490 --> 27:49.537
Um, your husband is
taking quite a long time.

27:49.624 --> 27:52.453
You should understand...
he's not really my husband.

27:52.540 --> 27:53.802
Oh, that's quite alright.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.412
We're not judgmental about such
things here.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.241
That's not what I mean.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.594
Whoa.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.771
Uppers and Downers.
Uppers and..

28:05.858 --> 28:07.990
...you're so rock 'n' roll,
doctor.

28:08.077 --> 28:09.644
That is private material.

28:09.731 --> 28:11.646
Doctor-patient privilege
is sacrosanct.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.996
Yes, I know.
That's why we did it this way.

28:14.083 --> 28:15.389
This is a murder investigation.

28:15.476 --> 28:17.608
We can be as hard-ass
as we want. I found it..

28:17.696 --> 28:19.567
...the, uh, patient roster
for the first two weeks

28:19.654 --> 28:21.177
of Doyle Murphy's stay.

28:21.264 --> 28:24.659
Guess who his acting sponsor was
when he first arrived?

28:24.746 --> 28:26.661
- Tom Doverton?
- No!

28:26.748 --> 28:28.968
- George.
- The brother?

28:29.055 --> 28:30.273
Yeah.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.535
I will be calling
your superiors.

28:31.622 --> 28:32.754
You know, a lot of people say
that to me

28:32.841 --> 28:34.016
and you know what I say?

28:34.103 --> 28:36.323
- I say--
- Let's go. Come on.

28:37.498 --> 28:40.806
[rattling pills]

28:40.893 --> 28:42.721
Get some help, doc.
That stuff will kill you.

28:45.201 --> 28:46.855
[instrumental music]

28:48.291 --> 28:49.423
[door creaks]

28:52.208 --> 28:53.993
George isn't here.

28:54.080 --> 28:57.997
He's already left.
He's not guilty, you know.

28:58.084 --> 28:59.476
How'd you know we were coming?

28:59.563 --> 29:01.522
The director
of the clinic called.

29:01.609 --> 29:04.394
He told us what you'd done.

29:04.481 --> 29:07.180
George was in rehab
with Doyle Murphy, that's true.

29:07.267 --> 29:08.834
But that's all that it was.

29:08.921 --> 29:11.314
So you're saying if we dig,
we won't find any more contact

29:11.401 --> 29:12.620
between George and Doyle?

29:12.707 --> 29:14.840
He came into the store.

29:14.927 --> 29:17.407
A guy like that
at Doverton & Company, I mean..

29:17.494 --> 29:19.975
Come on.
If my aunt found out..

29:20.062 --> 29:21.629
We need to talk to George.

29:21.716 --> 29:23.631
- He's gone.
- Oh, really?

29:25.502 --> 29:28.375
Uh, I think he's hiding
behind the door.

29:28.462 --> 29:29.637
George?

29:32.379 --> 29:34.337
George, come out.

29:45.305 --> 29:47.133
I'm sorry, Tom.

29:47.220 --> 29:48.395
You were just trying
to help.

29:49.700 --> 29:51.441
but we both know
there's no..

29:51.528 --> 29:53.095
...hiding from something
like this.

29:58.187 --> 29:59.623
I had nothing to do
with the robbery

29:59.710 --> 30:01.016
or Doyle Murphy's murder.

30:01.103 --> 30:03.976
I only lied to protect
my aunt from..

30:04.063 --> 30:05.804
...the shame of my addiction.

30:07.718 --> 30:10.896
Tom, call Dicky Purcell.
Tell him to..

30:10.983 --> 30:12.680
...meet me
at the CBI offices.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.116
- Yeah.
- After you.

30:25.388 --> 30:27.216
Excuse me.
Do you work here?

30:27.303 --> 30:30.045
Uh, certainly, sir.
Um, how can I help you?

30:30.132 --> 30:32.700
My wife...it's her birthday.

30:32.787 --> 30:35.964
Of course. Of course.
Uh, Michelle?

30:36.051 --> 30:37.226
Michelle here, would be happy
to help you.

30:37.313 --> 30:38.793
Thank you.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.577
- Mr. Doverton?
- Yeah.

30:40.664 --> 30:42.144
I need a signature
for this.

30:48.498 --> 30:49.630
There you go.

30:51.197 --> 30:52.328
What?

30:56.115 --> 30:58.378
"You'll get a call in 2 hours.

30:58.465 --> 31:01.337
"Take the jewels
where you are told.

31:01.424 --> 31:04.210
No cops or your aunt dies."

31:10.172 --> 31:11.521
[instrumental music]

31:14.960 --> 31:16.700
She's gone.

31:17.832 --> 31:18.920
Oh, God.

31:19.007 --> 31:21.575
Why would anybody kidnap
Aunt Esther?

31:21.662 --> 31:24.534
Someone thinks your brother was
partners with Doyle Murphy.

31:24.621 --> 31:26.406
Well, you think so.
Why shouldn't everyone else?

31:26.493 --> 31:28.495
Donny Culpepper?

31:28.582 --> 31:29.975
What? Who's Donny Culpepper?

31:30.062 --> 31:31.977
You saw him when we were
waiting for the elevator.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.848
Doyle Murphy owed him
a lot of money.

31:33.935 --> 31:36.633
He might think that that debt
transfers with the diamonds.

31:36.720 --> 31:37.852
Okay, but we don't have
the diamonds.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.158
Well, he doesn't know that.

31:39.245 --> 31:41.116
Well, you have to go
arrest him right away.

31:41.203 --> 31:43.989
That's what we're trying to do,
Mr. Doverton.

31:44.076 --> 31:46.600
Agent Van Pelt is working with
local police as we speak.

31:46.687 --> 31:50.604
- We're pursuing several leads.
- But the note says no police.

31:50.691 --> 31:52.954
Well, it's a little late
for that.

31:53.041 --> 31:55.609
Whoa. What are you gonna do? How
are you gonna get our aunt back?

31:55.696 --> 31:58.655
We'll do everything we can
to find her.

31:58.742 --> 32:01.310
In the meantime, when the
kidnappers call, you have to try

32:01.397 --> 32:02.921
and stall them.

32:06.011 --> 32:08.274
- Take that.
- Okay.

32:08.361 --> 32:09.579
Okay.

32:22.462 --> 32:25.421
- It's almost time. You ready?
- Yeah, ready.

32:25.508 --> 32:29.425
- And you?
- I don't know.

32:29.512 --> 32:31.036
Just stay calm.

32:31.123 --> 32:33.908
Keep the kidnapper on the line
and keep him calm.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.649
Remember, keep going
as long as you can, okay?

32:35.736 --> 32:36.955
[phone vibrating]

32:38.782 --> 32:40.654
- Headphones?
- Yeah, in the other room.

32:42.830 --> 32:44.005
Ready?

32:45.006 --> 32:46.181
Here we go.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.102
Hello?

32:54.189 --> 32:57.062
[distorted voice]
'Do you have the jewels ready?'

32:57.149 --> 32:58.324
[no audio]

33:00.021 --> 33:02.023
How do I know
you have my aunt?

33:02.110 --> 33:04.243
- I-I demand to--
- No.

33:04.330 --> 33:07.637
[kidnapper]
'You don't demand anything.
You shut up and you listen.'

33:07.724 --> 33:10.075
I-I-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

33:10.162 --> 33:12.903
- I-I just need proof before--
- Proof?

33:12.991 --> 33:14.514
[kidnapper]
'I'll give you proof.'

33:14.601 --> 33:16.690
[Esther]
'Hello? George?'

33:16.777 --> 33:18.866
Esther, are you alright?

33:18.953 --> 33:21.869
[kidnapper]
'There. That's your proof.'

33:21.956 --> 33:23.914
'If you want to see her
alive again'

33:24.002 --> 33:26.700
'you're gonna bring me
the diamonds.'

33:26.787 --> 33:29.224
I-I-I...I can't do that.

33:29.311 --> 33:31.096
- I-I...
- Got him.

33:31.183 --> 33:32.619
[kidnapper]
'You think this is
some kind of a game?'

33:32.706 --> 33:35.013
No! No. I-I-I'm sorry.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.927
[kidnapper]
'Are you gonna give me
the jewels?'

33:37.015 --> 33:41.019
I-I...I don't have the jewels.
I'm trying to tell you.

33:41.106 --> 33:44.544
[kidnapper]
'Alright, then.
This is your decision.'

33:44.631 --> 33:45.980
[gunshot]

33:46.067 --> 33:48.026
Aunt Esther!

33:48.113 --> 33:53.074
[kidnapper]
'You're next.
Now, I'm coming for you.'

33:53.161 --> 33:54.641
Oh, my God.

33:54.728 --> 33:55.946
[groans]

33:58.819 --> 34:00.125
Stay right there.

34:02.475 --> 34:03.693
Rigsby!

34:12.833 --> 34:14.139
[vibrates and rings]

34:15.574 --> 34:16.750
[ringing continues]

34:25.846 --> 34:27.239
Hello?

34:27.326 --> 34:29.502
[kidnapper]
'Where are the jewels, Tom?'

34:29.589 --> 34:33.288
- 'We both know you have 'em.'
- They're going to catch you.

34:33.375 --> 34:35.985
They're going to get you
right now.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.900
[kidnapper]
'No, no, no.'

34:37.987 --> 34:40.643
[kidnapper]
'I'm gonna get you,Tom.'

34:40.730 --> 34:42.993
[kidnapper]
'I know everything
about you.'

34:43.081 --> 34:46.214
[kidnapper]
'Yeah, Doyle Murphy
told me everything.'

34:46.301 --> 34:48.303
Screw you.

34:48.389 --> 34:50.914
I'll give you $50,000..

34:51.001 --> 34:53.699
...$50,000 to leave me
and my brother alone.

34:53.786 --> 34:55.963
[kidnapper]
'Oh, you think
you're so tough.'

34:56.050 --> 34:59.662
[kidnapper]
'You give me what I want, or I
will come and take it from you.'

34:59.749 --> 35:03.057
I'll make it $75,000,
but no more.

35:03.144 --> 35:05.277
I'm not givin' up
the diamonds.

35:05.364 --> 35:08.976
You stupid, rich brat.

35:09.063 --> 35:11.848
You think
you can dictate terms?

35:11.935 --> 35:14.068
Not this time, Tom.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.287
[distorted voice]
'Not this time.'

35:15.374 --> 35:18.551
'I'm gonna make you pay
and pay.'

35:18.638 --> 35:20.379
You try it.

35:20.466 --> 35:23.208
You try it,
and you see what happens.

35:23.295 --> 35:25.297
Tough guy, huh?

35:25.384 --> 35:27.864
You're gonna give me the same
thing you gave to Doyle Murphy?

35:27.951 --> 35:30.084
That's right.

35:30.171 --> 35:34.523
You push me hard enough,
and you'll see.

35:34.610 --> 35:38.571
Okay.
Thanks, Tom. That's great.

35:38.658 --> 35:42.270
We got it all on tape. You're
going down. Give me the phone.

35:42.357 --> 35:44.316
Hands behind your back.

35:44.403 --> 35:49.059
You're under arrest
for the murder of Doyle Murphy.

35:50.670 --> 35:51.758
Let's go.

35:53.890 --> 35:55.153
Like a charm.

35:59.896 --> 36:01.594
Ah, tea.

36:01.681 --> 36:02.638
Lovely.

36:07.165 --> 36:10.037
Ms. Doverton?

36:10.124 --> 36:12.822
I'm sorry, but we've had
to mislead you a little

36:12.909 --> 36:16.348
to solve this crime.

36:16.435 --> 36:19.568
I'm afraid I've got
some difficult news.

36:19.655 --> 36:22.658
Your nephew, Tom, was involved
in the robbery.

36:28.621 --> 36:29.796
Tom?

[monitor beeping steadily]

37:00.566 --> 37:01.697
Ahem.

37:03.786 --> 37:07.747
Oh, hey, Carl. Welcome back.

37:07.834 --> 37:09.052
[monitor beeping steadily]

37:09.139 --> 37:11.794
- Where am I?
- In the hospital.

37:11.881 --> 37:14.623
You just came out
of an induced coma.

37:14.710 --> 37:16.103
Can I ask you a question?

37:16.190 --> 37:18.061
What happened to me?
Who are you?

37:18.148 --> 37:24.067
Never mind that.
Tell me...Esther Doverton..

37:24.154 --> 37:26.592
...it was all a scam, right?

37:26.679 --> 37:29.638
You just wanted to cash
in with a rich, old broad.

37:29.725 --> 37:32.467
- Excuse me?
- Oh, come on.

37:32.554 --> 37:35.427
You don't need to be coy
with me. It's a great score.

37:35.514 --> 37:38.256
Plus, she's,
uh, she's pretty good-looking..

37:38.343 --> 37:41.520
...which is an added bonus
with these kind of scams.

37:41.607 --> 37:44.262
Are you talking
about my wife?

37:44.349 --> 37:45.741
Who the hell
do you think you are?

37:45.828 --> 37:47.047
Wouldn't that be
a better question

37:47.134 --> 37:52.748
for me to ask you,
Mr. Wysocki?

37:52.835 --> 37:55.708
- So that's it.
- Had to end sometime.

37:55.795 --> 37:57.405
You had a pretty good run.

37:57.492 --> 37:58.972
And you know what?
Between you and me

37:59.059 --> 38:01.017
I think you could squeeze
a little more nickel

38:01.104 --> 38:03.281
out of this poor old bat.
What do you think?

38:03.368 --> 38:05.935
Don't you talk about her
like that.

38:06.022 --> 38:07.328
That woman is
the only good thing

38:07.415 --> 38:08.764
that's ever happened to me.

38:08.851 --> 38:11.898
- I love her.
- You sure about that?

38:11.985 --> 38:14.030
Shut up and get out of here,
you son of a..

38:14.117 --> 38:15.597
Okay, gotcha.

38:21.603 --> 38:22.952
Told you he loved you.

38:28.741 --> 38:30.003
'Stop.'

38:30.090 --> 38:31.918
What are you
trying to do, kill yourself?

38:32.005 --> 38:35.835
I'm so sorry.
I never meant to hurt you.

38:41.144 --> 38:42.363
[instrumental music]

38:52.112 --> 38:53.287
Got it.

38:59.380 --> 39:00.860
Ah.

39:00.947 --> 39:02.949
A long time ago,
that might have been a frog

39:03.036 --> 39:05.473
or a fern or a dinosaur.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.083
Then it died,
turned into coal..

39:07.170 --> 39:09.782
Yeah, I know.
I did first grade geology, too.

39:09.869 --> 39:13.002
Well, I'm just saying, it's, uh,
just compressed carbon to me.

39:13.089 --> 39:15.265
If you want to keep it,
I never saw a thing.

39:15.353 --> 39:19.182
What? Get outta here. I wasn't
even thinkin' about that.

39:19.269 --> 39:21.184
Well, if you say so.

39:21.271 --> 39:24.187
Seriously, you'd let me just
walk out of here with this?

39:24.274 --> 39:25.580
Do you want to?

39:25.667 --> 39:28.235
No, of course not.
I mean, yes, I'm tempted.

39:28.322 --> 39:30.846
Okay, then.
Put it in your pocket.

39:30.933 --> 39:32.326
This is a trap, isn't it?

39:32.413 --> 39:35.590
Are you nuts? What do I care
about your integrity?

39:35.677 --> 39:37.200
Oh, yeah, trap.

39:38.419 --> 39:40.769
- Okay. Huh.
- Huh.

39:43.337 --> 39:46.949
- Oh, uh, Grace.
- Hi.

39:47.036 --> 39:48.951
Rigsby put something
in your pocket.

39:49.038 --> 39:50.213
What?

39:57.003 --> 39:58.178
Wow.

40:02.487 --> 40:05.141
H-he's messing with you.

40:05.228 --> 40:07.579
Oh, it's compressed carbon.

40:07.666 --> 40:09.232
If you want to keep it...

40:09.319 --> 40:12.497
I don't know about Rigsby,
but, uh..

40:12.584 --> 40:14.499
I wouldn't tell a soul.
