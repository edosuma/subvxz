00:01.367 --> 00:03.131
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.203 --> 00:06.866
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:06.939 --> 00:08.100
In New York City,

00:08.173 --> 00:11.109
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.177 --> 00:14.669
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.748 --> 00:16.443
These are their stories,

00:18.518 --> 00:19.951
BRODUS: What time is it?

00:20.020 --> 00:21.715
HUANG: You have
two hours Ieft.

00:21.788 --> 00:23.653
BRODUS: You're boring me.

00:23.757 --> 00:24.985
HUANG: Why?

00:25.058 --> 00:27.458
'Cause your theories
are flawed.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.226
Which ones?

00:30.530 --> 00:32.691
AImost all of them.

00:32.766 --> 00:36.497
And for the record,
I never degraded anybody.

00:36.569 --> 00:37.627
What do you care
what I think?

00:38.571 --> 00:41.734
Because according
to your theories,
I don't care about anything.

00:43.076 --> 00:44.907
It's not the Iast time,
and certainly not the first.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.071
Well, then, set me straight.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.072
Tell me about
your first time.

00:49.149 --> 00:51.208
I'm asking the questions now.

00:51.284 --> 00:54.720
You tell me
about your first time.
How do you remember it?

00:54.788 --> 00:57.382
Fondly.
I'm not asking you.

01:01.294 --> 01:02.488
Fondly.

01:03.396 --> 01:05.522
I don't have time for games.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.163
It was painful.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.226
BRODUS: For who?

01:12.305 --> 01:15.103
For her. I thought
I'd done something wrong.

01:15.175 --> 01:17.643
You did. You knocked her up.

01:17.710 --> 01:22.010
For all your sweaty fumbling,
you earned a Iifetime
of responsibility.

01:22.415 --> 01:25.179
You Iook the type to have
a Iot of Iittle bastards
running around.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.809
How many are there?

01:27.420 --> 01:28.580
A few.

01:30.356 --> 01:34.315
You're just a rutting dog
in the streets,
a slave to your impulses.

01:34.394 --> 01:35.691
Your point being,
you're just Iike me?

01:35.762 --> 01:37.923
You're exactly Iike me.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.628
My first time
was painful, too.

01:42.268 --> 01:45.669
But it was perfect.
The thing was exquisite.

01:45.738 --> 01:47.399
What was her name?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.204
Nice try.

01:51.177 --> 01:53.304
Well, now Iook
who's playing games.

01:53.379 --> 01:55.609
It's my party, gentlemen.
You can Ieave anytime.

01:55.682 --> 01:59.743
HUANG: But then you wouldn't
have any control,
and where's the fun in that?

02:00.353 --> 02:02.048
I hate psychiatrists.
Don't you?

02:02.122 --> 02:03.282
Absolutely.

02:03.356 --> 02:06.348
You're not Iiked.
How does that make you feel?

02:07.093 --> 02:08.151
Insightful.

02:08.228 --> 02:09.525
Really?

02:10.763 --> 02:14.199
You're a Iiar, Matt.
Your first time
wasn't perfect.

02:14.267 --> 02:17.327
In fact, it was
so disappointing,
you try not to remember it.

02:17.403 --> 02:21.339
You were so inept,
so inexperienced, that you
didn't even achieve a climax.

02:21.407 --> 02:24.342
Not even when
you were by yourself,
reliving the moment.

02:24.410 --> 02:29.211
One thing was young,
ripe, begging for it.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.609
But I took my time with it.

02:31.684 --> 02:36.644
It had the most beautiful
brown eyes, almost sleepy.

02:37.056 --> 02:41.186
Till I went to work.
Then they went big and round.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.759
First it pleaded,
then it bargained.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.162
This interview's over.

02:46.232 --> 02:49.827
The thing screamed in pain,
yelled in fear.

02:50.136 --> 02:53.071
It was alive
through every moment of it,

02:53.139 --> 02:57.906
even when I gutted it
and the blood sprayed
over me Iike a warm shower.

02:58.545 --> 02:59.739
(SLURPING)

02:59.812 --> 03:02.007
I can almost taste it.

03:02.448 --> 03:05.781
Relax, Chief. The guards
are changing shift.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.218
EIIiot, get up
from the table!

03:10.000 --> 03:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:11.584 --> 04:15.543
Detective Stabler. It's been
a while, so I don't expect
you'd remember.

04:15.622 --> 04:18.022
I'm AIIen Cooper,
my wife Hannah.

04:18.423 --> 04:19.982
Our daughter Debbie
was murdered...

04:20.059 --> 04:21.959
Debbie, of course.

04:22.028 --> 04:25.589
It'II be 1 1 years next month.
Her killer was never caught.

04:25.865 --> 04:27.355
She was on her way home
from school...

04:27.433 --> 04:31.631
When she was abducted. I
remember. My partner, Dave
Rosetti, was the Iead on it.

04:31.704 --> 04:34.366
Yeah. We heard he died.
We're real sorry.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.934
That's why we're coming
to you now. We know
who killed our Iittle girl.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.411
Who?

04:40.480 --> 04:42.141
Matthew Brodus.

04:43.483 --> 04:46.509
When it first happened,
we couldn't
get past the grief.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.816
Stuck in our heads,
in the pain.

04:48.888 --> 04:51.721
Losing Debbie
almost tore us apart.

04:51.791 --> 04:55.158
Grief therapy,
victims' groups.

04:55.228 --> 04:59.528
We finally got to a place
where we thought we could
deal with not knowing.

04:59.599 --> 05:02.124
At Ieast until
Matthew Brodus's
press conference.

05:02.201 --> 05:05.102
Well, what did he say
to make you believe
he killed your daughter?

05:05.171 --> 05:08.470
He wants to sell tickets
to his execution,

05:08.541 --> 05:11.772
claiming he's raising money
for his daughter's education.

05:11.844 --> 05:14.574
Well, he doesn't
have any children
that we're aware of.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.308
I still don't see
the connection, though.

05:16.382 --> 05:20.614
The school Brodus mentioned
was Our Lady of Light,
in Lower Manhattan.

05:21.387 --> 05:23.150
Debbie's old school.

05:26.392 --> 05:28.360
If Brodus is
Debbie Cooper's killer,

05:28.428 --> 05:30.362
why didn't the computer
match the signature?

05:30.430 --> 05:32.421
The murder happened pre-VICAP.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.898
A Iot of open homicides
that still aren't
in the system.

05:34.967 --> 05:37.458
New Jersey is not gonna Iet us
near this hump anyway,

05:37.537 --> 05:40.267
and even if they did,
Brodus could
still refuse to talk.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.739
No. Not this guy.

05:41.808 --> 05:43.435
What makes you so sure?

05:43.509 --> 05:46.945
Because serial killers
typically kill their victims
immediately

05:47.013 --> 05:49.106
and then they take their time
with the bodies.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.377
Brodus is different.
He kept his victims alive.

05:51.451 --> 05:54.614
He wanted them
to watch him work.
He needs an audience.

05:54.687 --> 05:58.088
Well, the ME's report stated
that Debbie Cooper
did suffer before she died.

05:58.157 --> 06:00.523
She was hogtied
with plumber's tape
and tortured.

06:00.593 --> 06:02.493
And Brodus worked
as a plumber's apprentice.

06:02.562 --> 06:05.224
He abducted his victims,
he murdered them
at a remote site

06:05.298 --> 06:06.697
and then he dumped
their bodies.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.825
This homicide matches
the Jersey victims.

06:08.901 --> 06:11.529
Except for
the pierced corneas,
committed premortem.

06:11.604 --> 06:13.572
Why blind this victim
and not the others?

06:13.639 --> 06:16.665
It's strictly symbolic,
since he wasn't going
to Iet her survive.

06:16.743 --> 06:18.210
She knew him.

06:18.611 --> 06:21.205
That's what Dave Rosetti
always thought when
we canvassed everybody.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.805
We could just never
make the damn connection.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.214
And what makes you think
you can now?

06:26.285 --> 06:28.776
Just get this guy
in front of me.
That's all I'II need.

06:28.855 --> 06:32.347
He dies in Iess than 72 hours.
That might not be an option.

06:32.425 --> 06:35.883
Brodus is a
multi-victim signature killer.
That's very rare.

06:35.962 --> 06:39.454
And it's even more rare
to find somebody
who's done it more than once.

06:39.532 --> 06:41.193
Maybe I could get
a field interview.

06:41.267 --> 06:43.098
Can the Feds
force Jersey to cooperate?

06:43.169 --> 06:47.731
No, but a request from
the brass might grease
the wheel. I'II Iet you know.

06:48.674 --> 06:51.871
EIIiot. Look, I...

06:52.745 --> 06:54.144
I know you want to help
the Coopers.

06:54.213 --> 06:56.841
That's not what this is about
and you know it.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.248
Dave Rosetti put a slug
through his jaw over this.

07:01.487 --> 07:03.717
You've got three days
to play it out.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.224
Have Munch run
the Cooper evidence box
over to the Iab.

07:06.292 --> 07:09.125
Maybe 10 years Iater
we can find some DNA.

07:13.966 --> 07:16.127
Beware the cop bearing gifts.

07:16.202 --> 07:19.365
Forget it. I've got three
separate yet simultaneous
trials to prep for.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.670
Hey, we're in a time crunch.
The perp dies
day after tomorrow.

07:22.742 --> 07:23.902
Are you trying to clear him?

07:23.976 --> 07:24.965
Not our jurisdiction.

07:25.044 --> 07:28.070
We just need some evidence
to tie him to our homicide.

07:28.147 --> 07:30.547
If he dies
before we can prove it,
the case remains open.

07:30.616 --> 07:31.947
What have I got to work with?

07:32.018 --> 07:36.216
Well, we got some
plumber's tape, various fibers
and two different blood types.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.347
Well, Iet me see
what I can do.

07:37.423 --> 07:38.515
You the man.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.326
(BELL RINGING)

07:43.396 --> 07:45.193
REICHART: Come on.
Don't be Iate.

07:45.731 --> 07:48.359
I didn't know Debbie Cooper.
She was before my time.

07:48.434 --> 07:50.994
What happened
to your predecessor,
Mr. Jamison?

07:51.070 --> 07:53.038
Died of a heart attack
in the mid '90s.

07:53.105 --> 07:55.505
I'm not really sure
how I can help you,
after all this time.

07:55.575 --> 07:59.136
Well, my notes state
Debbie Cooper was very
close to a few teachers.

07:59.212 --> 08:02.670
Vivian Parish,
Michael McKeeney
and Andrea Mason.

08:02.748 --> 08:04.010
Are they still employed here?

08:04.083 --> 08:05.778
I never met Vivian Parish.

08:05.852 --> 08:09.379
Michael Ieft teaching in '98.
I have no idea where he is.

08:09.455 --> 08:12.754
And Andrea Mason
teaches Government,
but she's out sick.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.122
We'II need her home number.

08:14.193 --> 08:15.751
It's in the office.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.126
Were there
any construction jobs
during that time?

08:18.197 --> 08:22.896
The rectory was converted
in the '60s. Gym, pool, track
were all added in the '70s.

08:22.969 --> 08:24.937
That's about it.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.562
Any plumbing problems?

08:26.639 --> 08:28.834
We had an old boiler system
that had to be replaced.

08:28.908 --> 08:31.775
Work was done by
a place in Brooklyn.
I'II get you the name.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.243
Thanks.

08:33.312 --> 08:36.577
I had three men
working that job.
Two of them are still here.

08:36.649 --> 08:38.082
And do you use subcontractors?

08:38.150 --> 08:40.880
Well, sure,
if the job's too big.
But this one wasn't.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.852
How many employees
did you have then?

08:42.922 --> 08:44.549
Fifteen, twenty.

08:44.624 --> 08:47.422
The apprentices
work part-time.
They come and go.

08:47.493 --> 08:51.327
Did you have
a Linwood Bradley,
Matthew Braeden

08:51.397 --> 08:52.887
or Lonnie Matthews
on the payroll?

08:52.965 --> 08:54.728
Hey, what's this all about?

08:54.800 --> 08:59.328
That serial killer,
Matthew Linwood Brodus.
Those are his aliases.

09:00.072 --> 09:02.632
Do you guys really think
if I had that crazy
working for me,

09:02.708 --> 09:05.142
I wouldn't have
gone to the police?

09:05.211 --> 09:08.840
Here, Iook for yourselves.
That bastard
never worked here.

09:10.917 --> 09:12.942
Pretty defensive for a guy
with a clear conscience.

09:13.019 --> 09:15.544
Maybe he didn't want
to be Iinked with Brodus,
but I'II check him out.

09:15.621 --> 09:17.179
Still no answer
at Andrea Mason's.

09:17.256 --> 09:20.248
When's the Iast time
you took a sick day
when you were actually sick?

09:20.326 --> 09:22.157
Good point. Stabler.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.091
Yeah. No problem.
I'II be there.

09:26.165 --> 09:30.158
AII right. Huang wants me
to meet him down at the FBI
field office for Iunch.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.430
Maybe he's got some good news.

09:31.504 --> 09:34.337
Good news from the Feds?
More Iike, "Bend over,
we're taking over your case."

09:34.407 --> 09:35.567
John, times have changed.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.233
They're not the Iying bastards
they used to be.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.478
HUANG: There's no time
for a sit-down Iunch.

09:40.546 --> 09:42.343
We're doing indirect
personality assessments

09:42.415 --> 09:43.939
with Brodus'
ex-cellmates today.

09:44.016 --> 09:45.040
How many are there?

09:45.117 --> 09:46.209
Thanks. Two.

09:46.285 --> 09:48.845
Robert Rule's doing Iife
for rape and manslaughter.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.754
Leroy Russell's on death row.
Converted to Islam inside.

09:51.824 --> 09:55.021
Since then he's been
a model prisoner,
refuses to talk to us.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.584
What are these IPAs
supposed to give us?

09:56.662 --> 09:59.392
Background, Iikes, dislikes,
any way to relate to Brodus,

09:59.465 --> 10:01.626
because he's not just
gonna confess to you.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.464
I know how to
interrogate a prisoner.

10:03.536 --> 10:06.528
I know you do, but I doubt
you've encountered this Ievel
of depravity before.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.233
I've dealt with
serial killers before...

10:08.307 --> 10:09.797
Who hunted for
short periods of time.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.002
They're more psychologically
inclined to confess.

10:12.078 --> 10:13.909
Brodus hunted for years
without detection.

10:13.980 --> 10:17.541
He's Iike Dahmer
and Lucas and Bundy.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.245
Sometimes it takes years
for killers Iike that
to relax their guard.

10:20.319 --> 10:23.482
Look, they all want to talk.
Even Bundy cooperated
in the end.

10:23.556 --> 10:26.047
Yeah. When you get closer
to the kill date
they become more pliable,

10:26.125 --> 10:29.993
but you gotta remember
this is a game. Brodus
is holding all the cards.

10:35.601 --> 10:39.401
You know,
I'm missing Wheel of Fortune
for this Iittle talk.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.104
What's in it for you?

10:41.173 --> 10:44.267
You want Brodus?
I want time shaved.

10:45.277 --> 10:47.768
Sorry. There's no deal
to be had.

10:47.847 --> 10:49.576
I'm serving a Iife sentence.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.810
You're a career criminal,
Rule.

10:51.884 --> 10:54.648
A Iife sentence
doesn't mean Iife,
death doesn't mean death,

10:54.720 --> 10:57.655
25 years,
it's 1 2 and a half-to-15.

10:57.723 --> 10:59.486
That burns you, huh?

11:00.893 --> 11:03.726
Look, I ain't going nowhere.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.991
Check with the warden.
I'm in for the Iong haul.

11:07.066 --> 11:10.001
Then you should be glad,
getting a good mark
on your prison record.

11:10.069 --> 11:13.596
Hey, I can't do something
for nothing. How would
that Iook on my block?

11:13.673 --> 11:14.901
I gotta Iive here.

11:14.974 --> 11:17.204
Deal depends on what you know
and then we'II talk terms.

11:17.276 --> 11:19.403
No. I think we're done here.

11:19.478 --> 11:21.446
We haven't even started.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.547
Either you
answer the questions
or you don't, Mr. Rule.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.414
The FBI doesn't deal.

11:30.923 --> 11:32.481
What the hell
was that all about?

11:32.558 --> 11:33.923
Procedure.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.228
I suggest you get familiar
with it before we do
any more interviews.

11:37.296 --> 11:39.491
We make deals all the time.
You should've heard Rule out.

11:39.565 --> 11:41.192
He doesn't know anything
except for background.

11:41.267 --> 11:42.962
We'd just be wasting our time
with anything else.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.026
Yeah, how do you know that
if you don't talk
to the scrote?

11:45.104 --> 11:47.299
Because Brodus would
never have told him
anything substantive.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.840
He would've considered
Rule beneath him.

11:48.908 --> 11:50.307
You know that for a fact, huh?

11:50.376 --> 11:52.241
I've been doing this
for a Iong time.
So have I.

11:52.311 --> 11:55.439
You don't get up
from the table until
you've seen everyone's hand.

11:56.916 --> 12:01.819
The FBI is running
these interviews and I'm
not offering any deals.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.651
I hope that's clear.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.896
Jersey won't play ball.
Okay. What can we do?

12:12.965 --> 12:15.490
File an official request,
Iet it go through channels.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.036
By the time we get
that answer, Brodus
will be dead and buried.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.265
We can't tell another state
how to run its business.

12:20.339 --> 12:23.274
New Jersey already has
an inferiority complex
when it comes to New York.

12:23.342 --> 12:26.277
They're digging
in their heels on principle.

12:27.113 --> 12:30.139
AIex, how many phone calls
from victims have you gotten

12:30.216 --> 12:33.185
asking why you Iost a case
and what you're gonna
do about it?

12:33.252 --> 12:34.719
I've had my share.

12:34.787 --> 12:38.052
And how many times
do you actually get
a second chance?

12:41.761 --> 12:43.194
What would you Iike me to do?

12:43.262 --> 12:44.559
File a temporary stay.

12:44.630 --> 12:46.461
No. I am not
comfortable with that.

12:46.532 --> 12:48.056
I'm not Iooking
to commute the guy's sentence.

12:48.134 --> 12:49.999
I just want a Iittle more time
for myself.

12:50.069 --> 12:53.869
Do you have
any direct evidence
Iinking Brodus to the victim?

12:54.440 --> 12:55.429
Not yet.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.839
Then find me some.

12:57.910 --> 12:59.400
In the meantime,
I'm gonna head to New Jersey

12:59.478 --> 13:02.276
and ask an old friend
for a really big favor.

13:07.753 --> 13:10.813
As good as it is to see you,
AIex, the answer's still no.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.380
It's just an interview.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.289
You've granted them to other
Iaw enforcement agencies.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.384
Why not to mine?

13:15.461 --> 13:19.090
Well, the other cops talked
to Brodus while he still
had appeals on the table,

13:19.165 --> 13:21.963
and we're on the home stretch
now, I can't afford to have
anything go wrong.

13:22.034 --> 13:25.401
We're not trying
to sabotage your execution.
We just want some answers.

13:26.372 --> 13:27.600
Well, if he's your guy,

13:27.673 --> 13:29.903
whoever the victim is
will have justice
the day after tomorrow.

13:31.210 --> 13:34.441
I cannot believe you're gonna
make me do this the hard way.

13:34.513 --> 13:38.381
What'd you expect,
ancient history to get you
an invite to the table?

13:39.785 --> 13:42.413
You know, I came here
as one professional
to another.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.513
I don't need to revel
in the past.

13:45.891 --> 13:48.485
You're good, AIex,
not spectacular.

13:49.161 --> 13:52.153
This is
a political powder keg,
so we can't accommodate you.

13:52.231 --> 13:54.631
What's the matter, AIan,
is this a re-election year?

13:54.700 --> 13:57.294
New Yorkers can't seek relief
because they don't vote here?

13:58.137 --> 13:59.798
You've grown a pair
since the Iast time I saw you.

13:59.872 --> 14:02.932
Yeah. Well, you've Iost yours,
because victims' rights
used to be a priority.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.168
What if he confesses?

14:04.243 --> 14:05.437
Is that such a bad thing?

14:05.511 --> 14:08.207
What is to stop him
from confessing to murders
in other states

14:08.280 --> 14:11.477
and whipping Iaw enforcement
into a jurisdictional frenzy?

14:11.550 --> 14:13.745
What then?
Then you deal with it.

14:13.819 --> 14:16.014
If he murdered other victims
and he takes it to his grave,

14:16.088 --> 14:17.817
you become the facilitator.

14:17.890 --> 14:21.986
Brodus will do anything,
say anything to stay
his execution.

14:22.061 --> 14:24.188
Henry Lee Lucas did it.
Bundy did it.

14:24.263 --> 14:26.322
It's their nature
to exploit our weaknesses.

14:26.398 --> 14:29.526
I'm sorry, AIex,
no one gets access. Period.

14:34.673 --> 14:37.039
Unfortunately there wasn't
enough blood to get DNA.

14:37.109 --> 14:39.373
What're you talking about?
The victim's shirt
was soaked in it.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.208
Well, the blood
was mostly hers,
not the killer's.

14:41.280 --> 14:44.443
EIeven years ago,
the Iab used 90%
of the sample for typing.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.545
Give us some good news.
Come on.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.779
Well, the fibers
are consistent
with uniform cloth.

14:49.855 --> 14:52.983
It was cross-matched to a
company that dyes material
for heavy crawl suits,

14:53.058 --> 14:54.650
pest control, construction.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.160
PIumbers' uniforms.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.695
AIso, the tape
that bound your victim

14:57.763 --> 14:59.731
matches the bin number
of the New Jersey bodies.

14:59.798 --> 15:00.856
There's our connection.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.298
Yeah, it's still
too circumstantial

15:02.368 --> 15:04.029
to force New Jersey's back
against the wall.

15:04.103 --> 15:06.230
I could compare
their fibers to ours.

15:06.305 --> 15:07.829
You think
we'd have any trouble
getting it from them?

15:07.907 --> 15:09.431
Not without a fight. No.

15:09.775 --> 15:11.936
You find anything to Iink
the plumbing company
to Brodus?

15:12.011 --> 15:13.808
No quarterlies were paid for
under any of his aliases.

15:13.879 --> 15:16.313
Under the table.
So I checked with the owner.

15:16.382 --> 15:19.442
Moderate business,
pays his taxes,
guy even does jury duty.

15:19.518 --> 15:21.577
I didn't know that
Iaw-abiding citizens existed.

15:21.654 --> 15:22.678
You recanvassed
the Cooper neighborhood?

15:22.755 --> 15:24.382
Yeah, and you owe me
a new pair of shoes.

15:24.456 --> 15:26.447
No, but after 10 years,
people move,
they don't remember.

15:26.525 --> 15:27.787
How about that teacher?
Andrea Mason?

15:27.860 --> 15:28.884
Yeah. Did you find her?

15:28.961 --> 15:30.223
The interview is scheduled
for tomorrow morning.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.730
I got you covered, EIIiot.
If there was anything solid,
I'd Iet you know.

15:32.798 --> 15:34.129
I'm running
out of time here, John.

15:34.199 --> 15:37.657
You're running out of options.
The Coopers
are running out of time.

15:39.138 --> 15:42.369
I need you to make a deal
with an inmate who shared
a cell with Brodus.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.068
What's he in for?

15:44.543 --> 15:47.205
Two counts rape,
one count manslaughter.
No.

15:47.279 --> 15:51.147
Look, I've hit a wall
and he may have
some information

15:51.216 --> 15:53.343
that'II help us with Brodus.

15:53.652 --> 15:55.415
He's not talking
without some kind
of incentive.

15:55.487 --> 15:57.352
Where's Huang on this?

15:57.456 --> 15:58.753
He wants to follow procedure.

15:58.824 --> 15:59.950
So do I.

16:00.025 --> 16:03.722
And while we play
by some arbitrary rules,
the Coopers just have to wait?

16:03.796 --> 16:07.823
EIIiot, why are you
pushing so hard?

16:09.201 --> 16:13.001
You know, I studied
the crime scene photos,
I read the files.

16:13.772 --> 16:16.935
Brodus mutilated 12 women,
premortem.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.442
It's pretty horrific stuff.

16:18.510 --> 16:22.776
Now try to imagine
the strength, the will it took
to keep those women alive

16:22.848 --> 16:24.839
and feed off their terror.

16:24.917 --> 16:29.286
I'm gonna need as much
ammunition as possible,
if I'm gonna trip this guy up.

16:29.355 --> 16:32.449
And you think this prisoner
will give you some Ieverage?

16:32.524 --> 16:35.721
Well, I ain't gonna know
unless I can talk to him.

16:37.563 --> 16:41.021
As soon as I corroborate your
information, we ship you off
to Danbury Federal Prison.

16:41.467 --> 16:44.834
That's fair.
I raped that girl.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.264
I know I belong in prison,
but not here.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.900
What can you tell me
about Matthew Brodus?

16:50.976 --> 16:53.877
I got a Iittle girl.
She's five.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.675
Her name's Marlene.

16:57.216 --> 17:00.014
Man, you bulls
sure know how to check up.

17:01.387 --> 17:04.982
My ex won't Iet me
talk to her.
She's all I got.

17:06.224 --> 17:10.457
It's hard to do time unless
you got something good
to hold on to.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.358
She sends me drawings

17:15.434 --> 17:21.270
and I got a photo
of her third birthday,
blowing out the candles.

17:21.339 --> 17:23.830
Where are we going with this?

17:24.009 --> 17:26.000
Will you call her for me?

17:28.947 --> 17:29.971
No.

17:31.316 --> 17:34.080
Look, you ask my ex,
how's my baby growing?

17:34.153 --> 17:37.122
What's her favorite color?
How's she doing in school?

17:37.189 --> 17:39.214
PIease, that's all I want.

17:39.591 --> 17:41.354
No.
PIease.

17:44.129 --> 17:46.029
I ain't got
nothing to say, man.

17:48.434 --> 17:51.801
AII I want is to find out
about my Iittle girl.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.041
If you had a kid,
you'd understand.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.343
I make that call,
we talk about Brodus?

18:04.817 --> 18:06.808
For as Iong as you want.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.348
What's the number?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.654
(DIALING)

18:18.363 --> 18:19.887
(PHONE RINGING)

18:23.202 --> 18:25.693
WOMAN: Hello?
Hello. This is
Detective EIIiot Stabler.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.602
I'm calling
on behalf of Robert Rule...

18:27.673 --> 18:29.368
I miss you so much!

18:30.008 --> 18:31.373
(DIAL TONE SOUNDING)

18:34.179 --> 18:35.646
She hung up.

18:37.483 --> 18:38.780
Satisfied?

18:39.318 --> 18:40.808
Yeah, right.

18:44.189 --> 18:45.850
Thanks for trying.

18:49.361 --> 18:52.524
If you have any questions
about the assignment,
just see me after class.

18:52.598 --> 18:54.463
Thank you, Miss Mason.

18:56.535 --> 19:00.232
Andrea Mason?
Detective John Munch.
We spoke on the phone.

19:00.572 --> 19:02.631
Right. Debbie Cooper,
10 years Iater.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.141
Yeah, how well
did you know her?

19:04.209 --> 19:06.234
Well, History
wasn't her best subject.

19:06.311 --> 19:09.610
She did a Iot of extra credit
to pull her grade up.

19:09.681 --> 19:10.670
That's it?

19:10.749 --> 19:12.979
Look, I'm sorry.
It was a Iong time ago.

19:13.051 --> 19:15.281
I think it's great
you're still trying
to solve her murder,

19:15.354 --> 19:16.946
but even when it was fresh

19:17.022 --> 19:19.855
she was just one
of many students
who pass through that door.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.187
She didn't really
stand out, huh?

19:21.260 --> 19:23.694
No. Debbie was awkward,
a Iate bloomer.

19:23.762 --> 19:27.721
Besides Vivian Parish and
a few friends, no one really
took an interest in her.

19:27.799 --> 19:29.596
Do you know
where I can find
Vivian Parish?

19:29.668 --> 19:32.398
Last I heard,
she moved to New Mexico.

19:32.638 --> 19:33.832
Thanks.

19:37.209 --> 19:39.769
Let me guess.
Rule gave you nothing.

19:40.746 --> 19:43.943
Just what he'd culled
from newspapers and the TV.

19:45.117 --> 19:48.018
One day you're going
to actually realize
that I know what I'm doing.

19:49.721 --> 19:51.348
I had to give it a shot.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.551
Apology accepted.

19:54.393 --> 19:55.917
Let's move on.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.157
So where do we go from here?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.933
Brodus' other cellmate.

20:03.001 --> 20:06.596
We figure out a way to get
Leroy Russell to sit down
with us. He's still refusing.

20:06.672 --> 20:08.663
Says it's not on his path
to AIIah.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.868
We're Iooking for
Detective Stabler.
His captain said he'd be here.

20:11.944 --> 20:15.038
Detectives Yorkin
and Janowicz,
Brooklyn SVU.

20:15.447 --> 20:18.848
Did you allow an inmate
named Robert Rule
to use your cell phone?

20:18.917 --> 20:19.975
What's going on?

20:20.052 --> 20:23.852
A call was placed to
a rape victim. She phoned
our precinct in hysterics.

20:23.922 --> 20:28.222
We dumped her phones
and got the cell number
for a Manhattan SVU detective.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.193
Care to tell us
what the hell you were doing?

20:36.068 --> 20:38.866
The victim's name
is EIizabeth Shachtman.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.838
She was 16
when Rule brutally raped her.
I read the file.

20:41.907 --> 20:45.138
A Iittle Iate for that.
What the hell
were you thinking?

20:45.210 --> 20:47.576
He gave me a hard Iuck story
about his kid and I bought it.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.511
Because you wanted to.

20:49.815 --> 20:52.375
Now, how did this convict
get the phone number?

20:52.451 --> 20:54.715
Rule was co-counsel
in his own defense.

20:54.786 --> 20:58.483
The victim's information
was Iisted because she was
a witness at his trial.

20:58.557 --> 21:01.390
I should put you on a desk
and send you over
to the Shachtman residence

21:01.460 --> 21:02.654
to explain yourself.

21:02.728 --> 21:04.252
I already did that.

21:10.702 --> 21:12.294
How's she doing?

21:13.572 --> 21:16.268
She feels violated. Again.

21:22.047 --> 21:25.380
I'II call Brooklyn.
See if I can't smooth it over.

21:29.888 --> 21:31.253
Vivian Parish.
She may have married.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.587
Can you check who's paying
her quarterlies? I'II hold.

21:34.459 --> 21:38.418
Tell me again how my partner
failed to get his
weapon recertification.

21:38.497 --> 21:40.624
He choked.
I didn't choke.

21:40.699 --> 21:43.361
Okay. He got poor marks
for shooting off
his gun early.

21:43.435 --> 21:46.302
That happens to everybody,
Fin. You know,
they have a pill for that now.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.132
So what's your next move?

21:52.044 --> 21:53.978
I don't have one. I mean...

21:54.046 --> 21:56.776
Brodus has another cellmate
but he's not talking to us.

21:56.848 --> 22:00.011
BENSON: Anything on the guy
you can use,
something to twist him with?

22:00.085 --> 22:03.316
He murdered a kid
in a convenience
store robbery.

22:03.388 --> 22:07.188
Shot him point blank
with a sawed-off. Converted
to Islam on the inside.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.193
He's made one appeal since.

22:09.261 --> 22:12.355
I suppose he wanted
his execution date moved up.

22:13.932 --> 22:14.990
Yeah. How do you know?

22:15.067 --> 22:16.295
He's on a path.

22:16.368 --> 22:19.804
It's the one thing
Christianity, Judaism
and Islam have in common.

22:19.871 --> 22:23.398
In order to be a man of God,
you gotta change
the man you are.

22:23.475 --> 22:26.808
Can't you appeal to this guy's
religion? I mean, you're
Iooking to clear a murder.

22:26.878 --> 22:29.039
That's gotta mean something
if his conversion's real.

22:29.114 --> 22:31.241
FIN: He's got a blood debt.
Use that.

22:31.316 --> 22:32.340
BIood debt?

22:32.417 --> 22:37.047
It's in the Koran.
He took a Iife, so he owes
a debt for spilling blood.

22:37.122 --> 22:38.919
It's Islamic justice.

22:42.260 --> 22:43.625
DANIEL: How can I help you,
Detective?

22:44.029 --> 22:47.328
PIease believe me that if
there were any other way,
I wouldn't be here.

22:47.399 --> 22:50.891
I've caused victims
enough grief already.

22:55.173 --> 22:57.869
Sir, I'm here to request
that you face
your son's killer

22:57.943 --> 22:59.570
and ask him to talk to us.

22:59.644 --> 23:02.670
Why? Why would you ever
ask me to do that?

23:02.748 --> 23:06.149
He may have some information
to give another grieving
family some relief.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.584
I can't.
I believe you can, sir.

23:10.322 --> 23:11.846
In my opinion,

23:13.058 --> 23:15.026
any man who opposed
the death sentence

23:15.093 --> 23:18.859
on behalf of his son's killer
is strong enough to face him.

23:18.930 --> 23:20.898
I don't give a damn
what you think.

23:20.966 --> 23:25.198
Yes, I spoke at his
sentencing. But I didn't do it
for him. I did it for me.

23:25.270 --> 23:29.502
His death doesn't Iessen
my pain and it sure as hell
doesn't give me back my son.

23:31.643 --> 23:33.770
I apologize
for reopening your wounds.

23:33.845 --> 23:35.244
You didn't.

23:35.313 --> 23:37.110
My wounds never heal.

23:38.717 --> 23:41.447
At Ieast you know
who killed your child.

23:42.187 --> 23:44.417
Debbie Cooper's parents don't.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.197
Why is he in chains?

24:00.272 --> 24:02.797
With a civilian in the room,
we take extra precautions.

24:05.343 --> 24:07.903
I'm told
you're a religious man now.

24:08.980 --> 24:10.140
I owe you a debt.

24:10.215 --> 24:11.580
DANIEL: You can't pay it.

24:11.650 --> 24:15.711
So I need you to talk
to these men. Answer their
questions and try not to Iie.

24:17.689 --> 24:19.213
Questions about what?

24:19.291 --> 24:20.690
STABLER: Matthew Brodus.

24:22.828 --> 24:24.955
I don't really know the man.

24:25.197 --> 24:28.394
You shared a cell with him
for three years. What were
your impressions of him?

24:29.768 --> 24:31.326
He's a killer.

24:31.403 --> 24:32.961
So you have a Iot in common.

24:37.642 --> 24:40.133
He used to always
ask me questions.

24:40.512 --> 24:42.343
What kind of questions?

24:42.414 --> 24:45.850
Why I was on death row.
Who I killed.

24:48.119 --> 24:49.609
How I did it.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.322
My answers
used to piss him off.

24:55.594 --> 24:59.086
That's because
you killed a young man
that you didn't hunt first,

24:59.164 --> 25:02.065
and so Brodus couldn't
get a vicarious thrill
from your experience.

25:02.133 --> 25:04.567
I shot that boy
'cause he saw my face.

25:05.504 --> 25:09.065
But Brodus,
he took joy in the killing.

25:11.676 --> 25:15.612
One night, he talked to me
about all the things he did.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.506
I asked to be moved
out of there after that.

25:18.617 --> 25:19.914
What kind of things?

25:21.853 --> 25:23.684
Stalking, gutting,

25:25.023 --> 25:27.014
doing things to the body.

25:27.325 --> 25:29.088
He used to think
he was smarter
than everybody else

25:29.160 --> 25:31.025
even when he made a mistake.

25:31.096 --> 25:33.064
He killed a blind girl
close to home.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.024
Did he say how he did it?

25:38.403 --> 25:41.395
No, and I didn't ask.

25:44.843 --> 25:47.038
Can I go now,
back to my cell?

25:48.113 --> 25:50.138
Evening prayers, you know?

25:51.683 --> 25:52.945
Officer.

25:57.355 --> 26:00.290
You refused to speak
during your sentencing.

26:02.193 --> 26:06.254
I need to know what my son's
Iast moments were Iike.

26:07.966 --> 26:09.729
Did he say anything?

26:11.970 --> 26:13.232
No, sir.

26:14.739 --> 26:19.540
You don't need the image of
your boy dying with my voice
in your head telling you how.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.276
Leroy Russell confirms
Brodus blinded and murdered
one of his victims

26:28.353 --> 26:29.752
that was too close to home.

26:29.821 --> 26:32.016
None of the New Jersey victims
match Leroy's story.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.114
That doesn't mean anything.

26:33.191 --> 26:35.216
It's hearsay testimony
from a man on death row.

26:35.293 --> 26:37.284
Munch Iocated that teacher,
Vivian Parish.

26:37.362 --> 26:39.387
Not only did she date Brodus
for six months,

26:39.464 --> 26:41.989
he regularly picked her up
from school and, I quote,

26:42.067 --> 26:43.932
"Gave Debbie Cooper
a ride home once or twice."

26:44.002 --> 26:46.266
Now is that enough
for a murder indictment?

26:46.338 --> 26:50.001
And as soon as I file,
they'II say we can have
him when they're done.

26:50.075 --> 26:51.508
So that's it?
We're done trying?

26:51.576 --> 26:53.544
What else can we do?

26:54.312 --> 26:56.576
Explain it to her parents.

27:00.685 --> 27:02.846
I understand
we have new evidence.

27:03.655 --> 27:05.520
So where do we go from here,
Miss Cabot?

27:06.091 --> 27:08.616
I'm not sure
what I can give you
besides knowledge.

27:11.062 --> 27:14.429
Can you prove
that Matthew Brodus
killed our daughter?

27:14.499 --> 27:16.524
Not in a court of Iaw.

27:16.601 --> 27:20.230
But we are reasonably sure
he's guilty and he is being
executed for his crimes.

27:20.305 --> 27:23.138
Are you familiar
with the name Ottis Toole?

27:24.042 --> 27:28.638
He's the guy every cop
believes murdered John Walsh's
six-year-old son, Adam.

27:28.713 --> 27:31.273
Toole died of AIDS
on death row
before we could prove it.

27:31.349 --> 27:34.614
And after 21 years
you can still see
the rage and grief

27:34.686 --> 27:36.654
that John Walsh
carries with him.

27:37.322 --> 27:40.314
His hope died
along with his son's killer.

27:41.459 --> 27:43.450
If you don't do everything
within your power

27:43.528 --> 27:46.827
to prove Matthew Brodus
murdered our daughter,
so will ours.

27:52.737 --> 27:55.797
I'm Wade Harris,
Matthew Brodus' Iead counsel.

27:55.874 --> 27:57.364
Nice to meet you.

27:57.442 --> 28:00.673
Frankly, I'm blown away
that the Manhattan
D.A.'s office

28:00.745 --> 28:02.906
is interested
in stopping this execution.

28:02.981 --> 28:06.041
We're not.
I want to put your client
on trial for murder.

28:06.117 --> 28:08.108
That should buy you
six months to a year.

28:08.186 --> 28:11.349
No, actually, I think
I could drag it out to 18,
if I drown you in paper.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.584
I've drafted the request
for a temporary
restraining order.

28:13.658 --> 28:16.024
And what makes you so sure
a judge will go for it?

28:16.094 --> 28:19.257
Evidence and an appeal
from the victim's parents.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.563
What kind of evidence?

28:22.867 --> 28:26.132
You file capital charges
against my client,
I have right to discovery.

28:26.204 --> 28:28.536
Only when and if I file.

28:30.275 --> 28:33.267
You need to keep
your client alive.
Right now, I'm all you've got.

28:34.145 --> 28:35.237
Deal?

28:45.990 --> 28:46.979
Miss Cabot?

28:47.325 --> 28:49.850
Your Honor,
the People are seeking
a temporary restraining order

28:49.928 --> 28:53.091
based on new evidence
Iinking Matthew Brodus
to an open homicide.

28:53.164 --> 28:55.689
None of which is under
New Jersey's
Iegal jurisdiction.

28:55.767 --> 28:57.860
As officers of the court,
we cannot ignore
capital crimes,

28:57.936 --> 28:59.028
no matter where they occur.

28:59.104 --> 29:02.164
I've reviewed their evidence
and it's circumstantial
at best

29:02.240 --> 29:06.836
and doesn't even meet the
criteria for trial, not here
and certainly not in New York.

29:07.312 --> 29:09.576
Is Manhattan proposing
to try Mr. Brodus?

29:09.647 --> 29:10.944
Not at this time, Your Honor.

29:11.015 --> 29:14.473
So is the purpose of the TRO
to go on a fishing expedition?

29:14.552 --> 29:17.487
Your Honor, the Iaw
does not allow for
posthumous jurisprudence.

29:17.555 --> 29:21.184
If Mr. Brodus dies before
discovery has been had,
the truth dies with him.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.557
This is a ploy
to stay the execution,
Your Honor.

29:23.628 --> 29:25.459
The defense
has exhausted their appeals

29:25.530 --> 29:27.521
and are now preying
on New York's desperation.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.624
I submit, the prisoner
is in your custody

29:29.701 --> 29:31.862
and available to be executed
at your discretion.

29:31.936 --> 29:34.769
Which is currently scheduled
for midnight tonight.

29:34.839 --> 29:37.467
We should not allow them
to stymie our ability
to mete justice.

29:37.542 --> 29:40.773
The prisoner will be
just as dead
six months from now.

29:40.845 --> 29:43.643
Your Honor,
we're not seeking justice,
we're only seeking the truth.

29:43.715 --> 29:46.741
Under the circumstances,
and given
who the defendant is,

29:46.818 --> 29:49.719
I'm not convinced
you'II be able to get it.

29:49.854 --> 29:52.345
AII right, people,
don't go far.

29:56.227 --> 29:58.092
So what are our chances?

29:58.163 --> 30:01.098
It's hard to gauge.
I'd say we're about even.

30:01.933 --> 30:04.663
So what's with the face?
You're acting Iike
we've already Iost.

30:04.736 --> 30:07.000
Something about
helping a convicted
serial killer

30:07.071 --> 30:10.871
avoid the needle
he so justly deserves
does not sit well with me.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.705
Is the judge back?
Not yet.

30:16.447 --> 30:18.881
Are you only Iooking
for an exceptional clearance?

30:18.950 --> 30:22.317
An interview
is all we've ever asked for.
Nothing's changed.

30:23.922 --> 30:25.753
I need your word
that you'II decline
to prosecute,

30:25.824 --> 30:27.655
no matter what Brodus
reveals to you.

30:29.127 --> 30:30.617
You've got it.

30:32.363 --> 30:35.457
I'II set up the interview.
Be ready in an hour.

30:40.305 --> 30:42.068
HUANG:
Try to keep him off balance.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.506
When I stress him,
be his friend.
Otherwise push him hard.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.407
You'II be watching
his body Ianguage
for signals.

30:46.477 --> 30:49.344
When you ask
an innocuous question,
I'II just back off.

30:49.647 --> 30:53.083
And pay attention to his eyes.
Serial killers
have this stare.

30:53.151 --> 30:55.676
It's focused.
It's Iike animals
when they're hunting.

30:55.753 --> 30:57.277
And when he's not hunting?

30:57.355 --> 30:59.721
Then he can't Iook you
in the eye.

30:59.891 --> 31:01.381
Anything else?

31:01.726 --> 31:03.387
You know,
this might not work.

31:04.295 --> 31:06.627
He's not going to trust us
and he might
play this out to the end.

31:06.698 --> 31:09.132
You gotta be prepared,
in case we run out of time.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.110
Hey.

31:25.283 --> 31:26.944
Detective Stabler.

31:28.319 --> 31:30.287
I'm Dr. George Huang.

31:32.924 --> 31:34.653
Behavioral science.

31:35.593 --> 31:39.927
Prescient spooks
studying rats in a cage.
How boring.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.299
STABLER: You're not boring,
Mr. Brodus.

31:43.668 --> 31:45.568
You can call me Matt,

31:47.472 --> 31:48.700
EIIiot.

31:50.308 --> 31:53.766
I'm not a mind reader.
They just announce
my visitors.

31:54.512 --> 31:56.002
So what's this about?

31:56.080 --> 31:59.174
Well, we just decided
to take you up
on your invitation.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.686
Not that I mind the company,
but I don't recall
inviting you.

32:04.889 --> 32:07.915
You also don't seem
too surprised
to be seeing us.

32:08.059 --> 32:11.358
Why should I be?
Feds come in and out all day.

32:13.865 --> 32:15.799
You been helping us out?

32:16.000 --> 32:17.627
As much as I can.

32:18.236 --> 32:21.171
But they want me
to admit to things
I haven't done.

32:21.239 --> 32:25.505
If it wasn't for the missing
women and their poor families,
I'd Iaugh.

32:27.178 --> 32:29.146
At what?
You cops.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.179
Trying to beat your own clock.

32:39.023 --> 32:40.251
(CLEARS THROAT)

32:40.692 --> 32:42.853
What's so special
about Our Lady of Light?

32:45.263 --> 32:46.628
That a church?

32:46.731 --> 32:49.928
Catholic high school.
You mentioned you wanted
to send your daughter there.

32:52.503 --> 32:55.165
I want her to have
a first-class education.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.403
You don't have
any children, Matt.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.068
You sure about that?

33:01.980 --> 33:05.814
You think any woman's
gonna come forward
with my kid?

33:05.883 --> 33:08.852
Much Iess admit to having
slept with me? Come on.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.717
How about you give me a name,
and I'II check it out?

33:10.788 --> 33:13.723
You'II have to wait
until my will
goes into probate.

33:20.164 --> 33:22.962
Why didn't you kill
your girlfriend,
Vivian Parish?

33:23.167 --> 33:24.566
Now you're insulting me.

33:24.635 --> 33:28.002
Well, I don't want to do that.
I apologize. It just seems
that if you'd killed her,

33:28.072 --> 33:29.903
you probably would've
gotten pinched right away

33:29.974 --> 33:32.499
and 13 women
would still be alive.

33:32.577 --> 33:34.875
We all know
the record says 12.

33:37.081 --> 33:39.675
We both know
the record is incorrect.

33:47.925 --> 33:49.790
They give you anything
for that insomnia, Matt?

33:49.861 --> 33:52.352
Pills don't work.
What time is it?

33:53.898 --> 33:55.866
It's 8:33.

33:58.703 --> 34:01.228
What's in the folder?
It's a project.

34:01.305 --> 34:03.603
I want to ask your opinion
about a killer's M.O.

34:05.810 --> 34:06.868
He still out there?

34:06.944 --> 34:09.242
Don't know.
He hasn't worked in a while.

34:09.313 --> 34:13.511
We wanted to go through the
three D's of sadism: dread,
dependency, degradation.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.347
Are you up for that?

34:17.655 --> 34:19.679
Can I take a Iook, please?

34:31.536 --> 34:32.935
What's this?

34:33.004 --> 34:35.370
A medical examiner's report
on the body.

34:36.974 --> 34:39.498
That's boring. Where are
the crime scene photos?

34:39.577 --> 34:41.909
There's a picture
under the report.

34:41.978 --> 34:44.641
It says our killer
tortured the victim.

34:45.449 --> 34:46.940
Any ideas why?

34:56.694 --> 34:58.753
No.
HUANG: Why not?

34:58.830 --> 35:00.957
You did
some of the same things
to your victims.

35:01.032 --> 35:02.659
The big girls that you chose.

35:02.733 --> 35:04.394
Since Debbie Cooper
was a big girl,

35:04.469 --> 35:08.200
we figured you might
have some ideas why
she was cut so deeply.

35:08.272 --> 35:11.503
If I could see
some crime scene photos,
I could probably help you.

35:11.576 --> 35:15.137
You don't need them.
Look inside your head.
You'II see it.

35:16.514 --> 35:19.779
See someone else's work?
Can't be done.

35:20.051 --> 35:21.746
STABLER: He overpowers her.

35:22.520 --> 35:25.182
Easy for a man of some size,
Iike you.

35:27.291 --> 35:30.920
He binds her tight with tape.
PIays with her for a while.

35:31.262 --> 35:33.253
HUANG:
He feeds off her terror.

35:33.898 --> 35:38.392
He can't get enough,
so that she dreads when
he Ieaves and when he returns.

35:38.469 --> 35:42.599
But he's not
gonna do her right away.
He wants a few days with her.

35:42.907 --> 35:44.374
So now she has
to depend on him.

35:44.442 --> 35:46.569
But then he has
to take the thing
and slice it open

35:46.644 --> 35:49.010
and see what's
going on in there.

35:50.081 --> 35:52.311
The knife goes in Iike butter.

35:53.284 --> 35:55.081
It's so warm inside.

35:56.254 --> 35:59.587
But he has to be
quick about it.
It'II be cold soon.

35:59.724 --> 36:02.124
STABLER: Why does he have
to be quick now?

36:02.426 --> 36:04.053
To be born again.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.363
Are we talking religion now?

36:08.432 --> 36:12.334
No. Where's the one place
that your mother
can never Ieave you?

36:12.436 --> 36:13.494
(GRUNTS)

36:14.772 --> 36:18.606
Psychiatric pap.
You always blame Mom.

36:18.676 --> 36:22.737
Yeah, yeah. Well, why not?
I mean, Iook at your mother.

36:22.847 --> 36:23.905
Leave her out of this.

36:23.981 --> 36:27.610
She couldn't stand you.
She Ieft you
with your grandparents.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.017
When they died,
she shipped you off
to foster care.

36:30.087 --> 36:31.645
She came and got me.
She Ioved me.

36:31.722 --> 36:36.682
Matt, tell the truth.
She got married. She had a
daughter with her new husband.

36:36.761 --> 36:41.391
And when she Ieft him,
she took your half-sister
with her and Ieft you behind.

36:41.465 --> 36:45.026
Again. I mean, obviously,
she must have Ioathed you.

36:45.102 --> 36:48.731
She saw the real you
and it made her want to vomit.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.702
How many times did she
tell you she wished
you'd been aborted?

36:51.776 --> 36:56.042
She never said that.
She Ioved me.
She never said that, ever.

37:01.852 --> 37:02.910
I'm done talking to you.

37:02.987 --> 37:05.751
We're not finished, Matt.
You're helping us
with this one case.

37:05.823 --> 37:07.654
We've covered dread
and dependency.

37:07.725 --> 37:10.091
Now we're gonna see
how Debbie Cooper
was degraded.

37:10.161 --> 37:12.220
How many times was the killer
with her postmortem, huh?

37:12.296 --> 37:15.129
What are you talking about?
That's obscene.

37:16.300 --> 37:18.427
Just think Iike the killer.
Go ahead.
How should I know?

37:18.502 --> 37:20.970
Ask the shrink.
He's probably treated
psychos Iike that.

37:21.038 --> 37:24.337
It depends on how often
the killer visited the body.

37:24.609 --> 37:27.703
How many times
did you check on your victims?

37:28.045 --> 37:32.948
Hey, I only went back
to see if they were still
where I Ieft them. That's all.

37:33.117 --> 37:36.052
Not this guy. He went back
to be with them, you know?

37:38.656 --> 37:40.283
I can't help you.

37:44.395 --> 37:47.660
Do you believe I'm gonna think
any Iess of you?

37:47.732 --> 37:51.031
I'm telling you, I never
messed around with them
after they were dead.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.093
The guy you're Iooking for
is sick. Real sick.

37:53.170 --> 37:55.832
What woman alive
would be with you, though?

37:55.906 --> 37:56.930
Vivian Parish.

37:57.008 --> 38:00.842
I talked with her. She said
you had a tough time
closing the deal.

38:00.911 --> 38:03.038
Well, if she said that,
then the bitch Iied.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.014
You're a cop, you're supposed
to tell the difference.

38:05.082 --> 38:07.482
Oh, I can and I do.

38:07.852 --> 38:11.982
It's in their nature.
They say they don't want it
but they really do.

38:12.056 --> 38:14.081
No means yes. Yes means no.

38:14.158 --> 38:17.650
You know, I should've
disappeared the whore
before she went out west.

38:17.728 --> 38:19.662
I missed my chance
by 20 minutes.

38:19.730 --> 38:21.357
But she knew who you were
and she was way ahead of you.

38:21.432 --> 38:23.593
She was an idiot,
a moon-eyed cow.

38:23.668 --> 38:26.466
Debbie just wanted someone
to tell her ugly ass
that she was pretty.

38:26.537 --> 38:29.802
Thought she was
in a Harlequin romance.
Stupid bitch.

38:29.874 --> 38:31.205
STABLER: Debbie?

38:35.012 --> 38:36.673
SIip of the tongue.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.914
One of my Jersey girls.

38:41.986 --> 38:44.454
No, it's not. None of them
are named Debbie or Deborah.

38:44.522 --> 38:47.150
None of the middle names
match, either.

38:48.025 --> 38:50.619
Why don't you stop Iying?
Let's just get down to it.

38:57.268 --> 39:00.533
You know, you're not as smart
as you think you are.

39:04.608 --> 39:06.200
What time is it?

39:06.410 --> 39:07.968
CABOT: How many of these
have you done?

39:08.045 --> 39:10.343
This is my second.

39:10.414 --> 39:13.247
If my presence
wasn't required,
I wouldn't be here.

39:13.317 --> 39:17.048
So you can ask for
the death penalty but you
cannot stomach the reality?

39:17.121 --> 39:21.217
I do my job.
I do it for the families.
I don't have to Iike it.

39:21.292 --> 39:22.657
(ALARM BLARING)

39:23.227 --> 39:25.787
Move! Go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!
What's going on?

39:25.863 --> 39:27.262
Wait!
Just move! Move!

39:27.331 --> 39:28.696
Hey, hey!
Move!

39:29.400 --> 39:31.766
Lock it down!
Lock it down!

39:32.737 --> 39:35.035
What's going on,
Mr. Messinger?
Is someone trying to escape?

39:35.106 --> 39:37.040
I don't know, Mr. Pierce,
but we'II be safe here.

39:37.108 --> 39:39.440
This isn't gonna
stop the execution, right?

39:39.510 --> 39:41.000
(MAN CHATTERING ON PA)

39:55.693 --> 39:57.718
Debbie didn't fight back.

39:58.596 --> 40:00.359
OFFICER: Get him off!
Get him! Hurry up!

40:00.431 --> 40:02.422
Get him off of him!
Get him off!

40:06.537 --> 40:08.368
You okay?
Got him?

40:09.607 --> 40:11.734
Don't! That's what he wants!

40:18.215 --> 40:20.012
Any news on Huang?

40:20.084 --> 40:22.450
He's going to be okay,
but they want to
keep him overnight.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.080
And Brodus?
He's on a ventilator.

40:26.323 --> 40:27.620
I have to tell the families.
I'II do it.

40:27.691 --> 40:28.715
I think you've done enough.

40:28.793 --> 40:32.194
They need to know
that he planned this.
I'II explain it to them.

40:32.263 --> 40:36.324
The only thing
that matters to them is
we can't execute him now.

40:36.400 --> 40:39.961
The state can't execute
an unhealthy man.
It's the Iaw.

40:40.037 --> 40:42.801
So as Iong as he's in a coma,
we can't get justice.
What a waste.

40:42.873 --> 40:46.639
You're wrong.
I got a confession
on Debbie Cooper.

40:51.515 --> 40:53.449
MESSINGER: They won't care.

40:54.485 --> 40:56.316
Would you?

41:00.090 --> 41:01.682
