WEBVTT

00:03.458 --> 00:05.667
I can't believe I'm spending
my vacation at the Animal Park

00:05.750 --> 00:09.500
sitting behind an elephant waiting for him
to pass the Zoo Director's cellphone.

00:09.667 --> 00:11.041
Ugh!

00:11.125 --> 00:12.250
It could be worse.

00:12.291 --> 00:14.166
Oh, it is. I have to call him
when I find it.

00:15.792 --> 00:17.041
Milton's so lucky.

00:17.125 --> 00:18.834
He gets to go to Scotland
with his parents.

00:18.917 --> 00:21.959
Oh, no, he's not going anymore.
His dad had some work thing come up.

00:24.208 --> 00:25.834
What is that awful sound?

00:25.917 --> 00:27.250
Sounds like a dying donkey.

00:32.875 --> 00:35.333
Takes people years to learn
how to play one of these things.

00:36.291 --> 00:38.041
-
- Suckers!

00:39.333 --> 00:41.583
- What's with the vacuum cleaner?
- They're bagpipes.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.458
The traditional instrument

00:43.542 --> 00:45.250
of my mother country Scotland.

00:45.834 --> 00:47.250
I thought you weren't going?

00:47.291 --> 00:50.834
I wasn't but the first-class tickets
were non-refundable.

00:50.917 --> 00:53.959
So I convinced my parents
to let me turn them into...

00:54.041 --> 00:55.500
five coach tickets.

00:55.583 --> 00:57.792
Which means we're all going to Scotland!

00:57.875 --> 00:59.750
We're going to Scotland!

01:00.166 --> 01:02.625
Oh, I've always wanted to learn
how to play the bagpipes.

01:03.458 --> 01:06.041
We're staying with my grandfather
at our family Castle.

01:06.125 --> 01:07.750
And we can even wear kilts!

01:07.834 --> 01:10.000
- What's a kilt?
- It's like a skirt for men.

01:10.083 --> 01:11.041
I'm in.

01:12.458 --> 01:15.083
Hey, Jack, I think you're blowing
too much air into that.

01:15.166 --> 01:17.709
No, I'm trying to build up the pressure.
It's all clogged.

01:24.000 --> 01:24.917
Sorry.

02:12.750 --> 02:15.291
Thank you for picking us up from
the airport, grandpa McKrupnick.

02:15.375 --> 02:16.542
We could have taken a cab.

02:16.625 --> 02:21.041
No! Then we would have missed
the eight-hour ride in the manure wagon.

02:22.417 --> 02:24.792
You're here at an exciting time.

02:25.041 --> 02:26.792
Tonight we have the banquet.

02:26.875 --> 02:28.250
And tomorrow...

02:28.667 --> 02:31.917
we start the great games!

02:32.542 --> 02:34.333
- What's that smell?
-

02:34.417 --> 02:36.959
Grandma's made her famous snouts.

02:38.542 --> 02:39.458
Ooh!

02:41.625 --> 02:44.625
Mmm. I'll say it.
This is the best snout I've ever had.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.250
- So, what are the great games?
- Well...

02:49.333 --> 02:52.208
They're a friendly competition between
the McKrupnicks and the McCrarys,

02:52.291 --> 02:53.792
they only other clan in the valley.

02:53.875 --> 02:56.792
It's to commemorate the end
of the feud between our two families.

02:56.875 --> 02:59.542
- Why were you feuding?
- Ooh, never ask that question!

02:59.625 --> 03:03.000
We swore to never ever speak
about the incident again!

03:03.375 --> 03:05.792
- I'm sorry. I won't ever--
- 'Twas a foggy night...

03:07.291 --> 03:08.959
Many generations ago...

03:09.375 --> 03:12.709
when the Devil's own Fergus McCrary
came on our land!

03:13.000 --> 03:16.166
- And he stole our only donkey!
-

03:16.917 --> 03:19.583
But 100 years ago, we finally made peace.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.583
Mm-hmm.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.875
Guys, I still can't believe
we're at a real Castle.

03:23.333 --> 03:26.375
The McKrupnicks have lived here
for over 400 years.

03:26.458 --> 03:30.000
And that handmade stained glass window

03:30.625 --> 03:33.875
tells the entire history
of the McKrupnick clan.

03:33.959 --> 03:36.375
It's easily our most valuable piece of--

03:39.291 --> 03:42.041
I told you kids
not to play ball out there!

03:45.750 --> 03:47.083
Yo, grandpa McMuffler...

03:48.709 --> 03:50.583
Where's the Loch Ness place
where the monster lives?

03:50.667 --> 03:53.875
Jerry, I've told you it was just a story
that was made up to bring in tourists.

03:53.959 --> 03:56.333
Oh, no, no! I've seen Nessie
with my own eyes.

03:56.792 --> 03:59.166
It was on a night just like this.

04:00.458 --> 04:01.417
In the lake...

04:02.166 --> 04:03.917
- behind our Castle.
- Wha--

04:05.709 --> 04:09.375
Rudy, do you realize how much money
we can make if we get a picture of her?

04:09.458 --> 04:12.625
Oh, please. You don't really believe
in that thing, do you?

04:13.792 --> 04:15.542
Get your camera.
Meet me in the boat in five minutes.

04:15.625 --> 04:16.458
Okay.

04:16.959 --> 04:20.250
Why did you make up that story?
Everyone knows Nessie isn't real.

04:20.291 --> 04:21.917
Well, I had to get rid of them.

04:22.291 --> 04:24.208
That Rudy's a wrecking ball!

04:24.792 --> 04:27.834
And the other one,
he's gonna be tootin' snouts all night.

04:36.375 --> 04:39.709
Dude! Dude, dude, dude. Ah, I see Nessie.

04:40.125 --> 04:44.417
Oh, beady eyes, scaly skin.
Man, she is ugly!

04:45.333 --> 04:46.333
You're looking at me.

04:48.583 --> 04:49.834
Give me those!

04:51.375 --> 04:53.291
We've been looking for Nessie for hours.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.166
Let's try a different part of the lake.

05:00.291 --> 05:01.709
Stupid motor won't turn over.

05:02.625 --> 05:04.417
Give me that hammer. I'll get it started.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.500
Okay, here.

05:15.083 --> 05:16.583
Told you I'd get it started.

05:17.792 --> 05:19.875
Look under the bench
and see if you can find some paddles.

05:19.959 --> 05:21.875
Okay.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.792
Hmm, let's see. Food.

05:25.875 --> 05:28.792
Water. Flares.

05:28.875 --> 05:30.250
Ah, spare engine.

05:30.333 --> 05:31.875
-
- Ah!

05:32.083 --> 05:33.333
Uh, no paddles.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.792
- That's it!
-

05:38.834 --> 05:40.417
Rudy, Rudy! Chill.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.959
- You're gonna tip the boat over!
- You're right.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.458
On the eve of the great games,

05:53.917 --> 05:56.375
I'd like to welcome everyone
to this feast.

05:56.625 --> 05:59.709
Celebrating the peace
between the two families.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.375
- The McKrupnicks...
-

06:02.458 --> 06:05.542
- And the McCrarys.
-

06:07.625 --> 06:11.208
- Hey, who's this big guy over here?
-

06:11.291 --> 06:15.041
Oh, that's Angus McCrary,
the strongest McCrary of them all.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.250
Yeah, he looks pretty big,

06:17.333 --> 06:19.166
but sometimes
size has nothing to do with--

06:21.083 --> 06:23.000
Oh, yeah, no, he's ridiculously strong.

06:24.291 --> 06:26.291
Guys, we're in Scotland, okay?

06:26.375 --> 06:28.750
- Let's get out there and have some fun.
-

06:36.417 --> 06:37.250
Dance.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.709
Oh, uh, I'm good, thanks.
I'm not much of a--

06:39.792 --> 06:41.583
- Wasn't a question.
- Whoa!

06:46.709 --> 06:49.208
Rudy, you think we'll
ever get to see Nessie?

06:49.291 --> 06:51.834
If we see her, I am eating her.
I am starving!

06:53.500 --> 06:55.250
I don't think there's any fish down there.

06:56.667 --> 06:57.625
Yo, Rudy!

06:58.625 --> 07:00.083
Rudy, check it out. Look.

07:00.583 --> 07:01.583
There's a fish out there.

07:11.166 --> 07:13.542
- What's in your mouth?
- Nothing.

07:17.125 --> 07:18.333
You've been eating cookies.

07:19.542 --> 07:22.458
- You disgust me!
- Rudy, I'm sorry.

07:23.250 --> 07:25.583
I don't want something as stupid
as a cookie to come between us.

07:29.375 --> 07:30.542
No!

07:31.125 --> 07:32.250
That's it!

07:46.709 --> 07:48.834
I'd like to thank the McCrarys for coming.

07:50.875 --> 07:53.375
And I'd also like to acknowledge
my grandson.

07:53.792 --> 07:56.250
And his friends
who came all the way here--

07:56.291 --> 07:58.959
If I could just say a few words here.

08:00.375 --> 08:02.083
What a special evening.

08:02.333 --> 08:06.250
Two families coming together
and forgetting their differences.

08:08.667 --> 08:12.667
And to think,
it all started over a donkey.

08:15.375 --> 08:18.625
A donkey that was stolen
from us by a McCrary.

08:25.792 --> 08:27.917
How dare you!

08:28.500 --> 08:30.417
We did not steal your donkey.

08:30.917 --> 08:32.291
It belonged to us.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.291
Uh, I think what's important here is--

08:34.417 --> 08:36.625
How can it be your donkey if we owned it?

08:36.709 --> 08:40.083
- Uh, you know, since--
- You cannot own a stolen donkey!

08:40.166 --> 08:42.667
That is a very sound legal position--

08:42.750 --> 08:45.000
The feud is back on.

08:45.083 --> 08:47.000
No, no, no, no, no. Not the feud.

08:47.083 --> 08:49.417
We can't have another
hundred years of fighting.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.834
- The boy's right.
-

08:50.917 --> 08:52.750
- Indeed he is.
- Of course I am.

08:52.834 --> 08:58.250
So whichever family loses the games
shall be banished from the valley forever!

08:58.667 --> 09:03.667
What? Who banishes anymore?
That's so 1800s.

09:03.750 --> 09:07.000
I will see you on the field of battle!

09:07.083 --> 09:08.208
- Aye!
- Aye!

09:08.291 --> 09:11.709
I really gotta learn to shut my yapper.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.917
Guys, this is all my fault.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.667
What am I gonna do?

09:19.750 --> 09:22.667
There's nothing you can do.
Your family's giving up and running away.

09:22.750 --> 09:26.709
Krupnicks aren't really built for running.
What we do is more of a brisk mosey.

09:28.667 --> 09:30.166
I've gotta try something.

09:31.041 --> 09:34.458
McKrupnicks, listen up.

09:34.917 --> 09:40.291
Oh! Blabby McBlab-blab
has something to say!

09:42.208 --> 09:44.583
I'm not giving up our Castle
without a fight.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.375
I'll go face the McCrarys alone
if I have to.

09:47.542 --> 09:49.000
- Even Angus.
-

09:49.250 --> 09:50.291
He won't be alone.

09:51.709 --> 09:52.792
I'll be with him.

09:54.542 --> 09:55.792
And I'll be with him too.

09:57.375 --> 09:58.959
Why would you fight for our family?

09:59.041 --> 10:00.625
Because Milton's more than our friend.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.000
He's our family.

10:03.583 --> 10:06.041
You know, like that weird cousin
who you know will never get married.

10:07.542 --> 10:08.625
Thanks for that, Kim.

10:10.375 --> 10:12.917
You three have the hearts of Lions.

10:13.709 --> 10:16.000
And I'm proud to consider you my family.

10:17.208 --> 10:20.166
McKrupnicks, raise your swords.

10:20.709 --> 10:22.000
- To honor.
-

10:22.208 --> 10:23.417
- To courage.
-

10:24.041 --> 10:26.166
- To victory!
-

10:28.834 --> 10:30.667
I ripped my little skirt off, didn't I?

10:36.750 --> 10:38.542
The McCrarys are here for battle.

10:43.125 --> 10:45.917
- The McKrupnicks are here for battle.
-

10:48.625 --> 10:50.834
I seem to have found a hard patch here.

10:52.041 --> 10:53.125
Here for battle!

10:56.375 --> 10:57.500
Here for battle!

11:00.250 --> 11:01.875
Got it!

11:02.500 --> 11:04.333
Oh.

11:04.417 --> 11:05.417
Thanks.

11:06.792 --> 11:10.250
-
- All right, Kim. This is your event.

11:10.333 --> 11:13.583
The castle door flip.
It's a test of strength.

11:13.667 --> 11:16.250
That castle door weighs over 200 pounds.

11:16.291 --> 11:19.208
Lift it and flip it over.
Just watch Megan.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.834
Just so you know, Jack,
I have full intentions of hugging you.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.417
Ha. Well, thanks,
but I'm not much of a huger.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.458
Oh, don't worry.

11:28.083 --> 11:29.208
I'll do all the work.

11:43.750 --> 11:46.333
You know, uh, that door looks kinda heavy.

11:46.417 --> 11:48.875
- You really think I can do this?
- Sure you can.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.750
You have a lower center of gravity.

11:51.166 --> 11:54.500
It's all mind over matter.
Come on, you're a black belt.

11:55.125 --> 11:56.166
You know what?

11:57.208 --> 11:58.458
You're right.

11:59.125 --> 12:00.000
Okay.

12:00.083 --> 12:01.709
All right, Kim.
Come on, Kim. You can do this.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.250
Lift with your legs, come on.

12:04.834 --> 12:06.458
- Come on.
- Here we go, here we go.

12:06.542 --> 12:08.041
You're doing well, you're doing well.

12:08.125 --> 12:09.291
Lift, lift, lift, lift!

12:15.041 --> 12:17.667
- Yes, yes! She's getting it!
-

12:17.750 --> 12:20.250
- Yes!
-

12:23.959 --> 12:25.083
Did I win?

12:27.667 --> 12:30.000
- You all right there, Kim?
- Yeah, I think so, why?

12:30.417 --> 12:31.542
Oh, I don't know.

12:32.083 --> 12:34.667
You're looking a little pancake-ish.

12:44.250 --> 12:46.000
You've been staring at me like that
all night.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.125
What are you thinking about?

12:52.834 --> 12:53.834
Oh.

12:54.291 --> 12:55.250
Nothing.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.291
I don't like the way you're looking at me.

12:59.417 --> 13:00.542
What are you thinking about?

13:06.458 --> 13:07.417
Nothing.

13:09.542 --> 13:12.542
I can't take it anymore.
You look delicious!

13:17.750 --> 13:21.291
Huh! Look at that. We did have a paddle.

13:27.667 --> 13:29.458
This is the chop and climb.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.917
Using nothing but two climbing axes,
you race to the top.

13:33.333 --> 13:35.166
First one to ring the bell wins.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.834
This is all upper body strength, Jack.
You should be good at this.

13:40.792 --> 13:41.834
I got this.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.750
Hey, uh, I hear you're pretty good.

13:47.834 --> 13:49.208
Check this out.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.000
Yeah, not very impressive.

14:07.417 --> 14:09.166
Ah, see, now that is impressive.

15:05.792 --> 15:07.834
-
- Yes!

15:11.333 --> 15:14.792
Come on down, Jack.
I got a victory prize for you.

15:15.250 --> 15:17.125
Uh, I'm good, Megan.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.375
I'm just gonna stay up here
and enjoy the view.

15:20.458 --> 15:22.709
All right,
I'll just wait down here for you.

15:23.125 --> 15:25.208
Quiet as a wee church mouse.

15:26.834 --> 15:28.250
Whoa!

15:31.125 --> 15:33.500
Ah, look who came down to see me.

15:33.583 --> 15:34.625
Uh... no.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.375
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

15:40.250 --> 15:41.125
Hey, Jerry.

15:41.542 --> 15:44.375
You know how the Wasabi code
tells us to never say "die".

15:45.291 --> 15:46.542
Yeah. I love that message.

15:46.959 --> 15:48.333
It's time to say die.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.500
Oh, Jerry, I'm gonna miss you.

15:52.583 --> 15:54.083
Me too.

15:57.208 --> 15:58.834
Quit your blubbering!

16:01.000 --> 16:02.583
You're scaring me clams.

16:06.875 --> 16:07.875
Rudy!

16:08.500 --> 16:10.125
Rudy, we're in like three feet of water.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.041
It's not deep at all.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.166
- We're gonna live?
- Yeah.

16:14.250 --> 16:15.208
We're gonna live!

16:15.291 --> 16:17.375
- We're gonna live!
-

16:17.458 --> 16:19.125
Let's never fall
for something like that again.

16:19.208 --> 16:21.291
Absolutely!

16:21.375 --> 16:23.041
Loch Ness Monster.

16:25.125 --> 16:26.417
Did you two hear?

16:26.875 --> 16:30.625
They spotted the Scottish
Sasquatch in the piney forest.

16:30.709 --> 16:31.750
Right over there.

16:32.667 --> 16:35.250
Yeah, like we're gonna fall for that.

16:35.333 --> 16:36.959
Scottish Sasquatch.

16:37.041 --> 16:38.041
Okay.

16:46.625 --> 16:49.875
Well, I can finally get back
to me clamming in peace.

16:53.208 --> 16:54.375
All right, it's all tied up.

16:54.458 --> 16:56.500
It's up to Milton,
how does this event work?

16:56.583 --> 17:02.208
Milton just has to get that 400-pound
boulder across the line faster than Angus!

17:03.500 --> 17:04.834
I'm gonna go finish packing.

17:07.625 --> 17:09.125
Look, Milton, we gave it our best shot.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.208
- Hang on.
- Let it go, buddy. It's over.

17:11.291 --> 17:12.333
Hang on, hang on.

17:14.125 --> 17:17.500
No, it's not. I can do this.
I can beat Angus.

17:17.583 --> 17:19.875
The rules don't say
I have to carry the boulder.

17:19.959 --> 17:21.959
I just have to get it across
the finish line.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.000
And that helps because...

17:24.083 --> 17:25.458
Because of physics.

17:25.542 --> 17:27.417
There's a six-degree slope to the field,

17:27.500 --> 17:29.500
so if I can get the boulder
off the pedestal,

17:29.583 --> 17:31.750
inertia will carry it
across the finish line.

17:31.834 --> 17:33.709
You know what the number one law
in physics is.

17:34.291 --> 17:35.250
You know I don't.

17:37.208 --> 17:40.291
An object in motion
tends to stay in motion.

17:40.417 --> 17:42.458
Oh.
- Yeah! So you understand?

17:42.709 --> 17:43.959
- No.
- Not even a little.

17:45.542 --> 17:48.625
Boys, take your positions.

17:52.166 --> 17:53.333
Good luck, little man.

17:54.333 --> 17:56.750
Oh. Good luck to you too, Angus.

18:00.333 --> 18:02.125
-
Let's go, Milton.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.250
It's too heavy. He can't move it.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.417
Wait. I think he's doing it. It's moving!

18:31.792 --> 18:32.875
Yeah!

18:41.417 --> 18:42.625
- Go, go!
- Go!

18:42.709 --> 18:44.583
Come on, Angus!

18:44.667 --> 18:47.709
Get up! Get up, you big ox! Get up!

18:47.792 --> 18:51.250
Push it! Push it, you beanpole!

18:52.875 --> 18:54.875
Jack, He can't get up.
The boulder's on his leg.

18:56.208 --> 18:57.834
Come on, Angus!

18:57.917 --> 18:59.834
Get up! Get up!

18:59.917 --> 19:02.375
Push it!
Push! It's right there, push!

19:02.458 --> 19:04.166
- Come on!
- Push!

19:05.375 --> 19:07.083
- Come on, Milton, go!
- Push it, Milton!

19:07.166 --> 19:09.917
- Push! Push!
- You're almost there!

19:13.208 --> 19:15.083
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

19:28.291 --> 19:30.709
Come, McKrupnick.
We'll cross the line together.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.083
But there can only be one winner.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.625
We cross together or I don't cross at all.

19:44.667 --> 19:47.041
The McKrupnicks have to leave the valley!

19:49.041 --> 19:51.333
No! They're not going anywhere!

19:52.500 --> 19:54.208
I couldn't have done it
without a McKrupnick.

19:55.917 --> 19:57.458
Milton and I both won.

19:58.875 --> 20:00.250
That's the way it should be.

20:00.625 --> 20:03.583
Our two families are stronger together
than we are apart.

20:04.291 --> 20:05.500
Right.

20:07.625 --> 20:08.709
The boys are right.

20:10.083 --> 20:13.709
Any bad blood between us
should be buried forever.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.750
Let's start right now.

20:17.125 --> 20:19.542
Would you like come with me
to a show tomorrow night?

20:20.375 --> 20:22.959
I have tickets for Lady Gaga!

20:25.125 --> 20:26.500
- The Gaga!
- Yeah!

20:26.583 --> 20:28.208
- I love The Gaga!
- Oh!

20:36.291 --> 20:37.709
All right, Megan.

20:38.375 --> 20:39.500
Bring it in.

20:39.959 --> 20:41.750
You had your chance, pretty boy.

20:42.125 --> 20:44.166
I found someone else I like better.

20:52.625 --> 20:54.542
How'd you get those snouts past customs?

20:54.625 --> 20:56.542
Oh, I hid them in my shorts. You want one?

20:59.291 --> 21:00.834
Wow, Rudy.

21:00.917 --> 21:02.959
You really like wearing that skirt,
don't you?

21:03.041 --> 21:05.208
For the thousandth time, it's not a skirt.

21:05.667 --> 21:08.166
This kilt is like the manliest thing
you can wear.

21:08.291 --> 21:11.417
It's been worn by Kings,
Knights, Warriors.

21:12.083 --> 21:14.625
I'm gonna go eat my pizza out
in the courtyard and show it off.

21:17.291 --> 21:19.458
Wow, look at the way
he's strutting around.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.917
Do you think he sees the guy
with the leaf blower?

21:29.709 --> 21:31.250
Nope! Didn't see him.
