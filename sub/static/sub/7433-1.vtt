<i>I was 12 going on 13</i>
<i>the first time I saw a dead human being.</i>

01:37.444 --> 01:39.594
<i>It happened in the summer of 1959...</i>

01:40.204 --> 01:41.717
<i>... a long time ago...</i>

01:42.244 --> 01:44.963
<i>... but only if you measure it</i>
<i>in terms of years.</i>

01:49.644 --> 01:52.841
<i>I was living in a small town in Oregon</i>
<i>called Castle Rock.</i>

01:53.564 --> 01:57.603
<i>There were only 1,281 people,</i>
<i>but to me it was the whole world.</i>

01:58.084 --> 02:01.599
<i>It's the Bossman Bob Cormier.</i>
<i>It's a beautiful Friday morning in Portland.</i>

02:01.684 --> 02:02.958
<i>It's 90 KLAM degrees and getting hotter.</i>

02:04.004 --> 02:07.314
<i>Up the ladder with another platter.</i>
<i>It's Bobby Day with</i> Rockin' Robin...

02:07.404 --> 02:08.598
<i>... it's boss.</i>

02:25.644 --> 02:28.522
How do you know a Frenchman's been
in your backyard?

02:28.804 --> 02:29.998
I'm French, okay.

02:30.084 --> 02:32.996
Your garbage cans are empty
and your dog's pregnant.

02:33.804 --> 02:35.840
Didn't I just say I was French?

02:35.924 --> 02:37.960
- I knock.
- Shit.

02:38.604 --> 02:39.593
Twenty-nine.

02:39.684 --> 02:40.912
Twenty-two.

02:41.124 --> 02:42.637
Piss up a rope.

02:44.724 --> 02:48.353
Gordie's out, OI' Gordie just bit the bag
and stepped out the door.

02:50.444 --> 02:51.843
Come on, man, deal.

02:52.124 --> 02:54.763
<i>Teddy Duchamp was the craziest guy</i>
<i>we hung around with.</i>

02:54.844 --> 02:56.835
<i>He didn't have much of a chance in life.</i>

02:56.924 --> 02:58.994
<i>His dad was given to fits of rage.</i>

02:59.164 --> 03:02.679
<i>One time he held Teddy's ear to a stove</i>
<i>and almost burned it off.</i>

03:03.684 --> 03:04.912
I knock.

03:05.724 --> 03:07.442
You four-eyed pile of shit.

03:07.524 --> 03:09.992
The <i>"</i> pile of shit <i>"</i> has 1,000 eyes.

03:12.364 --> 03:13.114
What?

03:13.204 --> 03:15.718
What's so funny?
I got thirty, what have you got?

03:15.804 --> 03:16.953
Sixteen.

03:17.044 --> 03:18.557
Go ahead, keep laughing.

03:18.644 --> 03:20.555
You're down to your ride, pal.

03:20.644 --> 03:23.761
<i>Chris Chambers was the leader of our gang</i>
<i>and my best friend.</i>

03:23.844 --> 03:27.519
<i>He came from a bad family</i>
<i>and everyone just knew he'd turn out bad.</i>

03:27.764 --> 03:29.243
<i>Including Chris.</i>

03:30.084 --> 03:32.234
That's not the secret knock.

03:32.644 --> 03:34.680
I forgot the secret knock. Let me in.

03:34.764 --> 03:35.879
Vern.

03:36.604 --> 03:38.640
Come on, you guys, open up.

03:39.164 --> 03:42.679
Man, you guys are not going
to believe this. This is so boss.

03:44.204 --> 03:46.035
Wait till you hear this.

03:46.164 --> 03:48.553
You won't believe it. It's unbelievable.

03:48.644 --> 03:51.795
Let me catch my breath. I ran all the way
from my house.

03:51.924 --> 03:54.074
<i>"</i> I ran all the way home <i>"</i>

03:54.204 --> 03:56.035
Come on. Listen to me, this is boss.

03:56.124 --> 03:58.354
<i>"</i> Just to say I'm sorry <i>"</i>

03:58.804 --> 04:01.557
Okay, forget it.
I don't have to tell you nothin <i>'.</i>

04:01.644 --> 04:03.874
Hold on, you guys. Hold on.
What is it, man?

04:03.964 --> 04:06.114
Great, you won't believe this, sincerely.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.035
<i>"</i> I ran all the way home <i>"</i>

04:08.164 --> 04:10.439
Screw you guys. Forget it.

04:10.524 --> 04:11.877
What is it?

04:11.964 --> 04:13.443
Can you camp out tonight?

04:13.524 --> 04:16.800
I mean, if you tell your folks
we're gonna tent out in my backfield?

04:16.884 --> 04:17.918
I think so.

04:18.004 --> 04:21.678
Except my dad's kind of on a mean streak.
He's been drinking a lot lately.

04:21.764 --> 04:24.915
You got to. Sincerely,
you won't believe this. Can you, Gordie?

04:25.004 --> 04:26.232
Yeah, probably.

04:26.324 --> 04:29.077
So what are you pissing and moaning
about Vern-O?

04:29.204 --> 04:30.432
- I knock.
- What?

04:30.804 --> 04:32.954
You liar! You ain't got no pat hand.

04:33.044 --> 04:35.080
You didn't deal yourself no pat hand.

04:35.164 --> 04:37.155
Make your draw, shitheap.

04:38.684 --> 04:40.754
You guys want to go see a dead body?

04:44.284 --> 04:45.956
I was under the porch digging, you know?

04:47.004 --> 04:49.393
<i>We all understood</i>
<i>what Vern meant right away.</i>

04:49.924 --> 04:53.360
<i>At the beginning of the school year</i>
<i>he had buried a jar of pennies...</i>

04:53.444 --> 04:54.957
<i>... underneath his house.</i>

04:55.044 --> 04:57.604
<i>He drew a treasure map</i>
<i>so he could find them again.</i>

04:57.684 --> 05:01.677
<i>A week later his mom cleaned out</i>
<i>his room and threw away the map.</i>

05:02.324 --> 05:05.316
<i>Vern had been trying to find those pennies</i>
<i>for nine months...</i>

05:05.404 --> 05:06.837
<i>... nine months, man.</i>

05:07.004 --> 05:09.234
<i>You didn't know whether laugh or cry.</i>

05:10.724 --> 05:12.442
Jesus, Billy, we gotta do something.

05:12.524 --> 05:14.401
Why? Who cares?

05:14.804 --> 05:16.283
- We saw him.
- So?

05:16.364 --> 05:19.515
It's nothin' to us. The kid's dead
so it's nothin' to him, neither.

05:19.604 --> 05:22.482
And who gives a shit if they ever find him?
I don't.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.879
It's that kid they're talking about
on the radio.

05:25.964 --> 05:29.161
Brocker or Brower or Flowers,
whatever his name is.

05:29.884 --> 05:31.715
The train must have hit him.

05:32.284 --> 05:33.637
Big fucking deal.

05:34.484 --> 05:36.873
<i>We had all followed</i>
<i>the Ray Brower story closely...</i>

05:36.964 --> 05:38.556
<i>... since he was a kid our age.</i>

05:38.644 --> 05:42.432
<i>Three days before, he left to pick</i>
<i>blueberries and nobody'd seen him since.</i>

05:42.524 --> 05:44.242
I think we should tell the cops.

05:44.324 --> 05:47.396
You don't go squawking to the cops
after you boosted a car.

05:47.484 --> 05:50.362
They'll want to know how we got way out
on Back Harlow Road.

05:50.444 --> 05:52.036
They know we don't got no car.

05:52.124 --> 05:54.718
It's best we just keep quiet,
then they can't touch us.

05:54.804 --> 05:56.954
But we could make an anonymous call.

05:57.484 --> 06:01.523
They trace those calls stupid. I seen it
on <i>Highway Patrol</i> and on Dragnet.

06:02.084 --> 06:03.233
Yeah, right.

06:03.604 --> 06:06.072
I wish we never boosted
that goddamned Dodge.

06:06.284 --> 06:07.876
I wish Ace had been with us.

06:07.964 --> 06:10.353
- We could've said he was in his car.
- He wasn't!

06:10.444 --> 06:13.163
- Are we gonna tell him?
- We're not going to tell nobody.

06:13.244 --> 06:14.996
Nobody, never. You dig me?

06:15.404 --> 06:16.917
I know the Back Harlow Road.

06:18.004 --> 06:21.121
It comes to a dead end by the Royal River.
The train tracks are right there.

06:21.204 --> 06:22.876
Me and my dad fished out there.

06:22.964 --> 06:26.036
If they had known you were under there,
they would've killed you.

06:26.124 --> 06:29.958
Could he have gotten all the way from
Chamberlain to Harlow? That's really far.

06:30.044 --> 06:34.356
Sure. He probably started walking on the
tracks and followed them the whole way.

06:35.604 --> 06:36.514
Yeah, right.

06:36.604 --> 06:40.517
And then after dark, a train must have
come along and <i>"</i> el smako <i>."</i>

06:46.604 --> 06:49.641
I bet you, if we find him,
we'll get our pictures in the paper.

06:49.724 --> 06:51.396
We could even be on TV.

06:51.484 --> 06:53.759
- Sure.
- We'll be heroes.

06:53.884 --> 06:56.352
I don't know. Billy will know I found out.

06:56.484 --> 06:59.442
He's not going to care.
'Cause it's gonna be us that find him.

06:59.524 --> 07:02.084
Not Billy and Charlie Hogan,
and the boosted the car.

07:02.164 --> 07:04.314
They'll probably pin a medal on you.

07:04.644 --> 07:06.077
You think so?

07:06.404 --> 07:07.200
Sure.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.436
What'll we tell our folks?

07:09.524 --> 07:11.082
Exactly what you said.

07:11.204 --> 07:14.037
We'll tell our folks
that we're tenting in your backfield.

07:14.124 --> 07:16.274
You tell your folks
your sleeping at Teddy's.

07:16.404 --> 07:19.043
Then we say we're going
to the drag races the next day.

07:19.124 --> 07:21.115
We're rock solid
until dinner tomorrow night.

07:21.204 --> 07:23.160
Man that's a plan and a half.

07:23.244 --> 07:27.317
But, if we find the body in South Harlow,
they'll know we didn't go to the races.

07:27.404 --> 07:28.473
We'll get hided.

07:28.564 --> 07:30.043
Nobody will care...

07:30.124 --> 07:32.763
...because everybody will be jazzed
at our discovery...

07:32.844 --> 07:34.482
...it won't make a difference.

07:34.764 --> 07:36.959
My dad will hide me anyway,
but it's worth it.

07:37.044 --> 07:39.035
- Shit, yeah.
- Let's do it. What do you say?

07:39.124 --> 07:40.398
- All right.
- Gordie?

07:40.484 --> 07:41.473
Sure.

07:41.644 --> 07:42.633
Vern?

07:43.044 --> 07:44.318
I don't know.

07:45.404 --> 07:46.917
Come on, Vern-O.

07:51.684 --> 07:53.754
- Okay.
- All right.

07:53.924 --> 07:55.721
Too cool. Very cool.

07:56.764 --> 07:59.836
<i>I wanted to share my friends' enthusiasm,</i>
<i>but I couldn't.</i>

08:01.524 --> 08:04.561
<i>That summer at home,</i>
<i>I had become The Invisible Boy.</i>

08:06.884 --> 08:09.478
Mom, do you know where my canteen is?

08:12.484 --> 08:13.553
Mom?

08:17.124 --> 08:18.716
It's in Denny's room.

08:20.924 --> 08:24.678
<i>In April, my older brother, Dennis,</i>
<i>had been killed in a jeep accident.</i>

08:25.204 --> 08:26.398
<i>Four months had passed...</i>

08:26.484 --> 08:30.716
<i>... but my parents still hadn't been able</i>
<i>to put the pieces back together again.</i>

09:07.524 --> 09:09.116
<i>Gordie, I got something for you.</i>

09:11.484 --> 09:13.236
This, my friend, is for you.

09:15.124 --> 09:17.001
- This is your Yankee cap.
- No.

09:17.084 --> 09:18.437
This is your Yankee cap.

09:18.524 --> 09:21.118
It's a good luck cap.
Know how many fish we'll catch?

09:21.204 --> 09:22.557
- How much?
- A bazillion.

09:22.644 --> 09:26.000
A bazillion fish.
It looks good on you, too. Just like that.

09:26.244 --> 09:30.442
- No. I'm going blind.
- Don't start with me. Give me a hug.

09:32.604 --> 09:33.798
You found it.

09:36.004 --> 09:37.198
You found it.

09:45.724 --> 09:48.113
Why can't you have friends like Denny's?

09:48.524 --> 09:49.877
Dad, they're okay.

09:50.084 --> 09:52.359
Sure they are. A thief and two feebs.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.363
Chris isn't a thief.

09:54.484 --> 09:56.554
He stole the milk money at school.

09:56.844 --> 09:58.641
He's a thief in my book.

10:15.004 --> 10:19.873
<i>It was almost noon as we set out to find</i>
<i>the body of a dead kid named Ray Brower.</i>

10:21.324 --> 10:22.803
Right here's cool.

10:26.564 --> 10:28.441
- Thanks a lot.
- Sure thing.

10:31.244 --> 10:33.394
- You want to see something?
- What?

10:33.524 --> 10:35.242
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

10:35.724 --> 10:36.793
What is it?

10:37.644 --> 10:39.953
- You've got to see this.
- What is it?

10:43.204 --> 10:44.398
What is it?

10:49.484 --> 10:52.237
You want to be the Lone Ranger
or the Cisco Kid?

10:53.084 --> 10:55.075
Walking, talking Jesus!

10:55.804 --> 10:59.035
- Where'd you get this?
- Hocked it from my old man's bureau.

10:59.204 --> 11:00.637
It's a.45.

11:00.724 --> 11:01.952
I can see that.

11:06.364 --> 11:08.195
You got shells for it?

11:08.404 --> 11:10.042
I took what was left in the box.

11:10.124 --> 11:14.322
My dad'll think he used them himself
shooting at beer cans while he was drunk.

11:15.164 --> 11:18.236
- Is it loaded?
- Hello, no. What do you think I am?

11:19.964 --> 11:20.919
Jesus!

11:21.044 --> 11:23.000
Let's get out of here. Come on.

11:24.924 --> 11:27.836
Gordie did it. Gordon Lachance
is shooting up Castle Rock.

11:27.924 --> 11:28.879
Shut up.

11:28.964 --> 11:32.161
Hey, who did that?
Who's letting cherry bombs off out here?

11:34.524 --> 11:37.641
You should have seen your face.
Damn, that was cool!

11:37.724 --> 11:40.682
- That was really fine.
- You knew it was loaded, you wet end!

11:40.764 --> 11:43.039
I'm in trouble now.
That Tupper babe saw me.

11:43.124 --> 11:47.163
- Shit, she thought it was firecrackers.
- I don't care. It was a mean trick.

11:49.044 --> 11:50.875
I didn't know it was loaded.

11:51.484 --> 11:53.600
- Honest.
- You swear?

11:54.604 --> 11:55.832
I swear.

11:55.964 --> 11:57.443
On your mother's name?

11:58.564 --> 12:00.555
Even if she goes to hell for your lie?

12:00.644 --> 12:02.123
I swear.

12:03.524 --> 12:04.923
Pinky swear?

12:06.724 --> 12:08.123
Pinky swear.

12:14.044 --> 12:15.716
Girls, where you going?

12:15.844 --> 12:19.154
- Come on, my brother gave me that!
- And now you're giving it to me.

12:19.244 --> 12:20.438
Give it to me!

12:21.724 --> 12:22.873
That's mine.

12:23.964 --> 12:26.194
You're a real asshole, you know that?

12:29.204 --> 12:31.399
Your brother's not very polite, Eyeball.

12:31.484 --> 12:32.803
Now, Christopher.

12:33.244 --> 12:35.712
I know you didn't mean to insult my friend.

12:36.244 --> 12:38.360
I know he didn't mean to insult me.

12:38.724 --> 12:42.353
That's why I'll give him the opportunity
to take it back.

12:45.244 --> 12:46.962
- Shit.
- Take it back, kid.

12:47.044 --> 12:50.116
- Stop it, you're hurting him.
- You bastard! Let go, man.

12:50.284 --> 12:52.673
- Stop it! Cut it out!
- Take it back, kid.

12:54.804 --> 12:57.716
You big <i>...</i> Okay, I take it back.

13:01.524 --> 13:02.434
There.

13:02.844 --> 13:05.312
Now I feel a whole lot better about this.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.723
How about you?

13:09.844 --> 13:10.959
Good.

13:13.844 --> 13:15.402
See you later girls.

13:26.284 --> 13:28.081
Let's just forget them.

13:41.204 --> 13:43.274
What do we need a pistol for anyway?

13:43.364 --> 13:46.834
It's spooky sleeping out at night
in the woods. You might see a bear.

13:46.924 --> 13:48.562
Or a garbage can.

13:52.124 --> 13:53.477
I brought a comb.

13:53.684 --> 13:55.163
What do we need a comb for?

13:55.244 --> 13:57.678
If we get on TV
we want to look good, don't we?

13:57.764 --> 13:59.755
- That's a lot of thinking, Vern.
- Thanks.

13:59.844 --> 14:01.323
Two for flinching.

14:06.724 --> 14:08.840
How far do you think it's gonna be?

14:10.044 --> 14:13.957
If we follow the tracks all the way
into Harlow, it should be about 20 miles.

14:14.044 --> 14:15.716
Sound about right to you?

14:16.124 --> 14:17.716
It might even be 30.

14:18.364 --> 14:20.275
Maybe we should just hitchhike.

14:21.244 --> 14:23.360
- No way, that sucks.
- Why not?

14:23.564 --> 14:25.953
We could go out to Route 7
to the Shiloh church...

14:26.044 --> 14:29.400
...then down the Back Harlow Road.
We'll be there by sundown.

14:29.484 --> 14:30.519
That's pussy.

14:30.804 --> 14:32.442
It's a long way.

14:32.804 --> 14:35.398
Did your mother ever have any kids
that lived?

14:35.724 --> 14:37.077
What do you mean?

15:02.604 --> 15:06.517
We have to fill up at the junkyard.
My dad said it was a safe well.

15:07.244 --> 15:09.997
- Not if Chopper's there.
- If he's there we'll send you in.

15:10.084 --> 15:11.233
Very funny.

15:15.324 --> 15:17.633
I'm kind of hungry. Who's got the food?

15:19.524 --> 15:21.276
Did anybody bring anything?

15:22.044 --> 15:24.080
Not me.

15:25.284 --> 15:28.356
This is great. What are we supposed
to do? Eat our feet?

15:28.524 --> 15:30.594
You mean,
you didn't bring anything, either?

15:30.684 --> 15:33.994
This wasn't my idea. It was Vern's.
Why didn't you bring something?

15:34.084 --> 15:36.552
I have to think of everything?
I brought the comb.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.238
What do you need a comb for?
You don't have any hair.

15:39.324 --> 15:42.043
I brought it for you guys,
so you'd have a comb.

15:42.444 --> 15:44.560
Let's see how much money we've got?

15:47.324 --> 15:49.201
I got $1.02.

15:51.324 --> 15:53.394
And 68 cents from Chris.

15:54.524 --> 15:56.082
60 cents from Teddy.

16:01.564 --> 16:03.316
7 cents, Vern?

16:04.124 --> 16:06.080
I haven't found my pennies yet.

16:06.524 --> 16:08.401
$2.37 cents, not bad.

16:09.164 --> 16:12.076
Quidaciolu's is at the end of the road
by the junkyard.

16:12.164 --> 16:14.155
I think we can get some stuff there.

16:14.244 --> 16:15.313
Train coming.

16:19.044 --> 16:20.318
Geronimo!

16:23.764 --> 16:25.243
Come on, Teddy.

16:27.164 --> 16:28.483
I'm gonna dodge it.

16:31.364 --> 16:33.161
Get off the tracks. You're crazy.

16:33.244 --> 16:35.394
Train dodge. Dig it?

16:40.684 --> 16:43.835
Get the hell off the tracks.
You want to get yourself killed?

16:43.924 --> 16:46.074
Just like the beach at Normandy.

17:02.004 --> 17:05.121
Don't tell me what to do or I'll kill you.

17:06.804 --> 17:08.601
I'm trying to save your life.

17:08.684 --> 17:10.117
You want to kill yourself?

17:10.204 --> 17:11.876
Is that what you want, goddamn it?

17:11.964 --> 17:14.034
You tried to kill yourself.

17:20.124 --> 17:21.876
I don't need no babysitter.

17:22.284 --> 17:23.603
You do, too.

17:29.404 --> 17:30.598
Skin it.

17:32.084 --> 17:33.517
I could have dodged it.

17:34.964 --> 17:37.524
Listen, you can dodge it on the way back.

17:38.684 --> 17:39.799
Peace.

17:40.804 --> 17:42.032
Skin it.

18:07.364 --> 18:11.073
<i>About this time, Charlie and Billy</i>
<i>were playing mailbox baseball...</i>

18:11.164 --> 18:13.075
<i>... with Ace and Eyeball.</i>

18:13.284 --> 18:15.115
Shit on that. Goddamn it!

18:16.004 --> 18:18.438
Shouldn't have gone for a wooden one.

18:18.924 --> 18:22.553
Why don't you tell me something
I don't know, asshole?

18:22.844 --> 18:24.197
Billy, you're up.

18:24.284 --> 18:26.479
You guys win.
I don't want to play no more.

18:26.564 --> 18:27.963
You can't quit.

18:28.284 --> 18:31.959
We only played three innings.
That'd be a non-official game.

18:32.364 --> 18:34.082
Ace, me and <i>...</i>

18:36.084 --> 18:39.201
What's with you homos?
You've been acting psycho all day.

18:41.604 --> 18:42.593
What is it?

18:42.684 --> 18:44.879
It's nothing, right?

18:45.364 --> 18:47.958
Then if you don't mind,
I'd like to finish this game...

18:48.044 --> 18:50.604
...before I start collecting
my social security, okay?

18:51.044 --> 18:53.000
You're up, Billy. Move it.

18:53.164 --> 18:55.200
All right, give me this fucking stick.

18:55.284 --> 18:56.876
Let's play ball.

18:59.644 --> 19:00.963
Foul ball.

19:14.804 --> 19:17.762
Vern, it looks like
your mom's been out driving again.

19:17.964 --> 19:20.000
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.

19:21.124 --> 19:22.443
Stand back, men!

19:23.844 --> 19:25.835
Paratroopers, over the side!

19:26.444 --> 19:30.198
<i>"No Trespassing" was enforced</i>
<i>by Milo Pressman, the junkman...</i>

19:30.284 --> 19:31.637
<i>... and his dog, Chopper.</i>

19:31.724 --> 19:35.399
<i>The most feared and least seen dog</i>
<i>in Castle Rock.</i>

19:35.604 --> 19:39.040
<i>Legend had it that</i>
<i>Milo had trained Chopper not just to sic...</i>

19:39.124 --> 19:42.434
<i>... but to sic specific parts</i>
<i>of the human anatomy.</i>

19:42.644 --> 19:46.034
<i>Thus, a kid who had illegally scaled</i>
<i>the junkyard fence...</i>

19:46.124 --> 19:49.878
<i>... might hear the dread cry:</i>
<i>"Chopper, sic balls!"</i>

19:50.204 --> 19:52.798
<i>But right now neither the dread Chopper</i>
<i>nor Milo...</i>

19:52.884 --> 19:54.556
<i>... was anywhere in sight.</i>

19:56.884 --> 19:58.158
Teddy's crazy.

19:58.244 --> 20:00.838
Come on, men, move it out!

20:01.644 --> 20:03.521
He won't live to be 20, I bet.

20:03.884 --> 20:06.398
Remember the time you saved him
in the tree?

20:07.764 --> 20:09.914
I dream about that sometimes.

20:10.724 --> 20:15.195
Except in the dream I miss him.
I just get a few hairs and down he goes.

20:15.324 --> 20:16.439
It's weird.

20:16.804 --> 20:18.078
That is weird.

20:18.684 --> 20:19.958
But you didn't miss him.

20:20.044 --> 20:22.239
Chris Chambers never misses, does he?

20:22.564 --> 20:25.124
Not even when
the ladies leave the seat down.

20:26.164 --> 20:27.040
Race you.

20:27.124 --> 20:29.684
- No, I don't think so.
- Over to the pump.

20:29.764 --> 20:33.154
- I'm kind of tired. Go.
- You're a dead man, Lachance!

20:33.444 --> 20:35.753
It looks like Lachance
has got him this time.

20:35.844 --> 20:37.277
He's got Chambers beat.

20:37.364 --> 20:39.753
But what's this?
Chambers is making his move.

20:39.844 --> 20:42.199
Lachance is fading
and it's Chambers at the tape.

20:42.284 --> 20:44.036
The crowd goes wild.

21:03.604 --> 21:06.118
You guys been watching
<i>The Mickey Mouse Club</i> lately?

21:07.004 --> 21:09.074
I think Annette's tits are getting bigger.

21:09.164 --> 21:10.517
- You think so?
- I think so.

21:10.604 --> 21:11.798
I think he's right.

21:11.884 --> 21:16.674
I've been noticing that the A and the E
are starting to bend around the sides.

21:17.684 --> 21:19.322
Annette's tits are great.

21:21.364 --> 21:23.116
This is a really good time.

21:23.324 --> 21:24.200
The most.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.512
A blast.

21:25.684 --> 21:28.915
<i>Vern didn't just mean being off limits</i>
<i>inside the junkyard...</i>

21:29.004 --> 21:30.722
<i>... or fudging on our folks...</i>

21:30.804 --> 21:34.513
<i>... or going on a hike up the tracks</i>
<i>to Harlow. He meant those things, but...</i>

21:34.604 --> 21:38.074
<i>... it seems to me now it was more</i>
<i>and that we all knew it.</i>

21:38.164 --> 21:40.234
<i>Everything was there and around us.</i>

21:40.324 --> 21:44.033
<i>We knew exactly who we were</i>
<i>and exactly where we were going.</i>

21:44.524 --> 21:45.843
<i>It was grand.</i>

21:49.644 --> 21:52.602
Great, spit at the fat kid. Real good.

21:53.084 --> 21:54.597
What time is it?

21:55.844 --> 21:57.277
It's a quarter after one.

21:57.364 --> 22:00.242
You'd better go get the food.
Junkyard opens at 3:00.

22:00.324 --> 22:01.757
Chopper'll be here.

22:01.924 --> 22:03.243
Sic balls.

22:04.164 --> 22:06.553
You go. You can pick us up
on the way back.

22:06.644 --> 22:08.555
I'm not going alone. We should all go.

22:08.644 --> 22:11.522
- I'm staying right here.
- I'm not going.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.683
Girls, cool it. We'll flip for it.

22:14.924 --> 22:16.039
Okay.

22:16.564 --> 22:17.713
Odd man goes.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.522
That's you, Gordie, odd as a cod.

22:19.604 --> 22:21.242
Flip or eat lead.

22:26.884 --> 22:28.237
Four tails.

22:28.484 --> 22:30.475
Jesus, man, that's a goocher.

22:30.564 --> 22:33.522
- That doesn't mean anything.
- No, let's go again.

22:34.404 --> 22:35.757
That's really bad.

22:35.844 --> 22:40.122
Remember Clint Bracken and those guys
got wiped out on Weed Hill in Durham?

22:40.204 --> 22:43.321
He said they flipped for beers
and they came up with a goocher...

22:43.404 --> 22:45.235
...just before they got in the car.

22:45.324 --> 22:47.713
And, bang! They all got totalled.

22:47.844 --> 22:50.358
I don't like this. Sincerely.

22:51.644 --> 22:54.158
Nobody believes that crap
about moons and goochers.

22:54.244 --> 22:57.077
It's baby stuff. Now come on, flip again.

23:00.684 --> 23:02.197
Are you going to flip or not?

23:02.284 --> 23:04.115
We don't have all day.

23:07.724 --> 23:09.362
You lose, Gordie.

23:10.644 --> 23:11.793
Gordie loses.

23:11.884 --> 23:14.318
Old Gordie just screwed the pooch.

23:14.804 --> 23:17.682
Does the word <i>"</i> retarded <i>"</i>
mean anything to you?

23:18.404 --> 23:20.474
Go get the provisions, you morphadite.

23:20.564 --> 23:23.032
Don't call me any
of your mother's pet names.

23:23.204 --> 23:25.081
What a wet end you are, Lachance.

23:25.364 --> 23:26.240
Shut up.

23:26.324 --> 23:29.714
I don't shut up, I grow up.
And when I look at you, I throw up.

23:31.564 --> 23:34.442
Then your mother goes around the corner
and she licks it up.

23:36.884 --> 23:40.672
<i>Finding new and disgusting ways</i>
<i>to degrade a friend's mother...</i>

23:40.764 --> 23:42.914
<i>... was always held as high regard.</i>

23:55.324 --> 23:57.440
Ain't you Denny Lachance's brother?

23:58.404 --> 23:59.678
Yes, sir.

24:00.964 --> 24:02.920
Shame what happened to him.

24:03.724 --> 24:06.875
The Bible says,
<i>"</i> In the midst of life we are in death <i>."</i>

24:07.204 --> 24:08.796
Did you know that?

24:10.404 --> 24:12.315
I lost a brother in Korea.

24:14.204 --> 24:16.240
You look like your brother Denny.

24:16.324 --> 24:17.996
People ever tell you that?

24:18.524 --> 24:19.843
Sometimes.

24:22.924 --> 24:25.358
I remember the year
he was All-Conference.

24:25.604 --> 24:27.196
Quarterback, he played.

24:28.124 --> 24:29.682
Boy, could he throw.

24:29.924 --> 24:32.438
Father God and Sonny Jesus.

24:37.684 --> 24:39.720
Could be some scouts
at the game tomorrow.

24:39.804 --> 24:42.398
- I don't know, Pop.
- Dad, could I have the potatoes?

24:42.484 --> 24:46.033
- That's what I hear, Son.
- Are you going to see Jane after the game?

24:46.124 --> 24:47.637
I think she's a lovely girl.

24:47.724 --> 24:51.512
- Dad, may I please have the potatoes?
- Dorothy, don't talk to the boy about girls.

24:51.604 --> 24:55.677
He shouldn't be thinking about girls.
This is the biggest game of his life.

24:56.404 --> 25:00.158
- Dennis, when you're there tomorrow...
- Did you read the story Gordie wrote?

25:00.244 --> 25:01.472
Gordie wrote a story.

25:01.564 --> 25:03.919
- It was really good.
- What did you write, sweetheart?

25:04.004 --> 25:07.758
That's what I'm talking about.
Football takes concentration.

25:07.844 --> 25:11.154
You start in on the girls
and his mind's all over the place.

25:11.364 --> 25:12.763
I really liked it.

25:13.284 --> 25:14.922
I thought it was great.

25:19.924 --> 25:21.596
You play football?

25:23.284 --> 25:25.081
Do you play football?

25:27.164 --> 25:28.199
No.

25:28.644 --> 25:30.157
What do you do?

25:32.324 --> 25:33.757
I don't know.

25:34.044 --> 25:37.002
Your brother, Denny,
sure could play football.

25:42.004 --> 25:43.960
There you go, kid. $1.50 of hamburger.

26:11.964 --> 26:14.717
You, kid! What are you doing there!
Come over here!

26:14.804 --> 26:18.843
You, come back here, goddamn it!
I'll sic my dog on you.

26:18.924 --> 26:20.357
Run!

26:21.524 --> 26:23.674
Chopper, sic him! Sic him, boy!

26:24.044 --> 26:25.841
<i>Now he said: "Sic him, boy."</i>

26:25.924 --> 26:28.882
<i>But what I heard was: "Chopper, sic balls."</i>

26:44.204 --> 26:45.603
That's Chopper?

26:45.724 --> 26:49.876
<i>Chopper was my first lesson in the vast</i>
<i>difference between myth and reality.</i>

26:50.204 --> 26:52.798
Come on, Choppie. Kiss my ass, Choppie.

26:54.084 --> 26:55.802
Come on, bite shit.

26:57.564 --> 26:59.953
Sic balls, Choppie.

27:00.044 --> 27:03.753
You kids stop teasing that dog!
You hear me? Stop teasing him!

27:04.084 --> 27:06.723
Sonny, I'm gonna beat your ass,
teasing my dog like that!

27:06.804 --> 27:09.398
Let's see you climb over this fence
and get me, fat ass!

27:09.484 --> 27:10.997
Don't you call me that!

27:11.084 --> 27:13.962
You little tin weasel
peckerwood loony's son!

27:15.844 --> 27:17.118
What did you call me?

27:17.204 --> 27:20.196
I know who you are,
you're Teddy Duchamp.

27:20.444 --> 27:21.763
Your dad's a loony.

27:21.844 --> 27:23.994
A loony up in the nuthouse at Togus.

27:24.124 --> 27:27.514
He took your ear and he put it to a stove
and he burnt it off.

27:28.124 --> 27:30.319
My father stormed the beach at Normandy.

27:30.404 --> 27:34.682
He's crazier than a shithouse rat.
No wonder you're acting the way you are...

27:34.764 --> 27:36.675
...with a loony for a father.

27:36.844 --> 27:39.756
You call my dad a loony again
and I'll kill you.

27:40.124 --> 27:41.557
Loony, loony.

27:42.324 --> 27:45.236
I'm gonna rip your head off
and shit down your neck.

27:45.524 --> 27:47.594
No, I'm gonna kill him!

27:47.684 --> 27:49.834
You come on and try it, you little bastard.

27:49.964 --> 27:53.354
He wants you to go over so he can beat
you up then take you to the cops.

27:53.444 --> 27:56.163
You watch your mouth.
Let him do his own fighting.

27:56.244 --> 27:59.520
Sure, you only outweigh him
by 500 pounds, fat ass.

27:59.604 --> 28:00.923
I know your name.

28:01.204 --> 28:04.196
You're Lachance. I know all you guys.

28:04.484 --> 28:07.237
And your fathers will get a call from me.

28:07.644 --> 28:10.033
Except for the loony up in Togus.

28:11.204 --> 28:13.877
I'm going to kill you. I'll show you.

28:13.964 --> 28:16.558
- Get him away from...
- You foulmouthed whoremaster.

28:16.644 --> 28:17.997
You son of a bitch!

28:18.204 --> 28:19.398
You come back here.

28:19.484 --> 28:20.633
Do you hear me?

28:20.724 --> 28:22.760
Nobody ranks out my old man.

28:22.964 --> 28:25.762
- My father stormed the beach...
- I said, <i>"</i> Come back here!<i>"</i>

28:25.844 --> 28:28.961
- He stormed the beach, you faggot!
- Come back here.

28:36.884 --> 28:40.081
We showed him.
Thought we were a bunch of pussies.

28:41.004 --> 28:42.801
He ranked my old man.

28:42.924 --> 28:46.519
<i>I wondered how he could care so much</i>
<i>for his dad who'd almost killed him...</i>

28:46.604 --> 28:50.756
<i>... and I didn't care about my own</i>
<i>who hadn't touched me since I was three.</i>

28:50.844 --> 28:52.755
<i>That was for eating bleach under the sink.</i>

28:52.844 --> 28:54.755
He ranked my old man.

28:55.044 --> 28:58.798
What do you care what a fat old pile of shit
like him says about your dad?

28:58.884 --> 29:01.637
He still stormed the beach
at Normandy, right?

29:02.764 --> 29:05.073
Do you think that pile of shit
was at Normandy?

29:05.164 --> 29:06.233
Forget it, okay?

29:06.324 --> 29:08.792
He knows nothin' about your old man.
He's shit.

29:08.884 --> 29:11.842
Whatever's between you and your old man,
he can't change that.

29:11.924 --> 29:13.721
Forget it, all right?

29:41.924 --> 29:45.041
I'm sorry if I'm spoiling
everybody's good time.

29:47.004 --> 29:48.403
It's okay.

29:49.724 --> 29:51.954
I'm not sure it should be a good time.

29:52.964 --> 29:55.114
- You saying you want to go back?
- No.

29:56.404 --> 30:00.363
But going to see a dead kid,
maybe it shouldn't be a party.

30:03.204 --> 30:07.356
If he's really bad, like all cut up
with blood and shit all over him...

30:07.444 --> 30:09.036
...I might have nightmares.

30:09.844 --> 30:12.483
All guts and eyeballs
ready to jump and grab...

30:12.564 --> 30:14.520
Shut up, goddamn it!

30:14.644 --> 30:15.872
I can't help it.

30:17.044 --> 30:18.272
Sorry.

30:20.284 --> 30:23.037
<i>It was only a quarter to three,</i>
<i>but it felt much later.</i>

30:23.484 --> 30:25.759
<i>It was too hot and too much had happened.</i>

30:26.164 --> 30:28.314
<i>We weren't even close to the Royal River.</i>

30:28.964 --> 30:33.037
<i>We needed to get moving if we were</i>
<i>going to make some real miles before dark.</i>

30:40.324 --> 30:42.076
Hold still, will you?

30:48.564 --> 30:51.636
So what's with you
and this Connie Palermo chick?

30:52.084 --> 30:56.043
I've been seeing her for over a month,
and all she'll let me do is feel her tits.

30:56.124 --> 30:59.082
She's a Catholic. They're all like that.

30:59.284 --> 31:01.957
You want to get laid
you gotta get yourself a Protestant.

31:03.364 --> 31:04.797
A Jew's good.

31:05.604 --> 31:06.798
<i>A KLAM newsbreak.</i>

31:06.884 --> 31:09.603
<i>We interrupt to bring you an update</i>
<i>on the search for...</i>

31:09.684 --> 31:11.242
<i>... 12 year-old Ray Brower.</i>

31:11.324 --> 31:13.713
<i>The police have expanded their search</i>
<i>to Mutton...</i>

31:13.804 --> 31:15.556
<i>... Durham and the outlying areas.</i>

31:15.644 --> 31:17.236
When are they going to give up?

31:17.324 --> 31:19.315
The kid's gone. They'll never find him.

31:19.404 --> 31:21.281
Not where they're looking.

31:21.444 --> 31:23.719
I was right,
they ain't never gonna find him.

31:23.804 --> 31:26.841
Would you hold still?
You're making me fuck up the snake part.

31:27.204 --> 31:29.240
I'll tell you how they're gonna find him.

31:29.324 --> 31:32.873
Ten years from now a hunter's going to go
into the woods to take a leak...

31:32.964 --> 31:35.080
...wind up pissing on his bones.

31:35.164 --> 31:37.394
I bet you a $1,000
they find him before that.

31:37.484 --> 31:39.440
Bet you $2,000 they don't.

31:39.524 --> 31:42.197
- Well, asshole...
- What's the big deal?

31:42.364 --> 31:45.083
- Who cares?
- Would you two just shut the fuck up.

31:45.684 --> 31:48.835
If either one of you assholes had $2,000,
I'd kill you both.

31:49.764 --> 31:51.482
<i>We're back here with The Bossman.</i>

31:51.564 --> 31:53.873
<i>From the racks and stacks,</i>
<i>it's the best on wax.</i>

31:53.964 --> 31:56.398
<i>It's the Cordettes, with</i> Lollipop.

32:21.244 --> 32:22.723
I got some Winstons.

32:22.804 --> 32:24.795
Hocked them off my old man's dresser.

32:24.884 --> 32:26.795
One apiece, for after supper.

32:27.004 --> 32:28.119
That's cool.

32:29.404 --> 32:32.123
That's when a cigarette tastes best,
after supper.

32:32.204 --> 32:33.114
Right.

32:40.364 --> 32:41.717
Do you think I'm weird?

32:41.804 --> 32:43.715
- Definitely.
- No, seriously.

32:44.724 --> 32:45.839
Am I weird?

32:46.964 --> 32:49.194
Yes, but so what? Everybody's weird.

32:57.844 --> 32:59.357
You ready for school?

33:00.164 --> 33:01.279
Junior high.

33:01.884 --> 33:04.557
You know what that means.

33:04.644 --> 33:06.475
By next June we'll all be split up.

33:06.564 --> 33:08.953
What are you talking about?
Why would that happen?

33:09.044 --> 33:12.081
'Cause it's not going to be like
grammar school, that's why.

33:12.164 --> 33:15.440
You'll be taking college courses,
and me, Teddy, Vern we'll all be...

33:15.524 --> 33:18.561
...in the shop courses
making ashtrays and birdhouses.

33:21.924 --> 33:25.041
You're gonna meet a lot of new guys.
Smart guys.

33:25.684 --> 33:28.152
- Meet a lot of pussies is what you mean.
- No, man.

33:28.244 --> 33:30.280
Don't say that. Don't even think that.

33:30.364 --> 33:33.640
- I'm not going in with a lot of pussies.
- Then you're an asshole.

33:33.724 --> 33:36.113
What's asshole with wanting
to be with your friends?

33:36.204 --> 33:38.240
It's asshole if your friends drag you down.

33:38.324 --> 33:41.953
You hang with us, you'll just be
another wise guy with shit for brains.

33:42.324 --> 33:44.554
You think Mighty Mouse could
beat up Superman?

33:44.644 --> 33:46.839
- What are you, cracked?
- Why not?

33:47.284 --> 33:50.082
The other day, he was carrying
five elephants in one hand.

33:50.164 --> 33:51.995
You don't know nothin <i>'.</i>

33:52.284 --> 33:53.876
Mighty Mouse is a cartoon.

33:53.964 --> 33:57.877
Superman is a real guy.
No way a cartoon could beat up a real guy.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.876
Yeah, maybe you're right.

34:02.084 --> 34:03.995
Would be a good fight, though.

34:06.884 --> 34:09.239
You could be a real writer someday.

34:09.484 --> 34:11.679
Fuck writing! I don't to be a writer.

34:11.764 --> 34:15.120
- It's stupid. It's a stupid waste of time.
- That's your dad talking.

34:15.204 --> 34:16.795
- Bullshit!
- Bulltrue!

34:16.884 --> 34:19.842
I know how your dad feels about you.
He doesn't care about you.

34:19.924 --> 34:23.678
Denny was the one he cared about,
and don't try to tell me different.

34:29.444 --> 34:31.002
You're just a kid, Gordie.

34:31.083 --> 34:32.676
Gee thanks, Dad.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.715
I wish to hell I was your dad.

34:36.083 --> 34:40.521
You wouldn't be talking about taking
these stupid shop courses if I was.

34:41.364 --> 34:45.596
It's like God gave you something, man,
all those stories that you can make up...

34:45.684 --> 34:48.960
...and He said, <i>"</i> This is what we got
for you. Try not to lose it <i>."</i>

34:49.043 --> 34:52.434
Kids lose everything unless there's
someone there to look out for them.

34:52.524 --> 34:55.994
If your parents are too fucked-up to do it,
then maybe I should.

34:57.324 --> 34:59.042
Come on, you guys, let's get moving.

34:59.124 --> 35:02.434
By the time we get there
the kid won't even be dead anymore.

35:46.164 --> 35:48.883
Any of you guys know
when the next train is due?

35:49.484 --> 35:51.714
We could go down to the Route 136 Bridge.

35:51.804 --> 35:54.762
What? Are you crazy?
That's five miles down the river.

35:54.844 --> 35:58.041
You walk five miles down the river,
you gotta walk five miles back.

35:58.124 --> 35:59.523
That could take till dark.

35:59.604 --> 36:02.994
We go across here, we can get
to the same place in 10 minutes.

36:03.524 --> 36:05.958
But if a train comes, there's nowhere to go.

36:06.044 --> 36:08.000
No, there isn't. You just jump.

36:08.204 --> 36:10.434
- Teddy, it's a 100 feet.
- Yeah, Teddy.

36:11.844 --> 36:13.755
You guys can go around if you want.

36:13.844 --> 36:15.118
I'm crossing here.

36:15.204 --> 36:17.559
And while you guys
are dragging your candyasses...

36:17.644 --> 36:21.922
...half-way across the state and back,
I'll be waiting for you on the other side...

36:22.004 --> 36:23.835
...relaxing with my thoughts.

36:24.804 --> 36:27.682
You use your left hand
or your right hand for that?

36:28.164 --> 36:29.438
You wish.

37:33.284 --> 37:34.876
I lost the comb.

37:35.644 --> 37:36.963
Forget it, Vern.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.680
Train!

38:18.524 --> 38:19.513
Shit!

38:20.244 --> 38:22.041
Move it, man! Go on! Move it!

38:22.124 --> 38:23.921
Get up, Vern! Damn it!

38:24.324 --> 38:26.792
Get up! Move it!

38:27.644 --> 38:28.793
Shit, Vern!

38:29.284 --> 38:32.003
- Get up, man!
- I don't want to. We're gonna fall.

38:33.004 --> 38:35.916
We're gonna die, damn it! Get up!

38:36.644 --> 38:37.679
Go.

38:44.724 --> 38:47.238
- You've got to go faster!
- I can't, Gordie!

38:52.044 --> 38:52.920
Run!

38:57.724 --> 38:59.999
Run, Vern, run! Move your ass!

39:07.324 --> 39:09.076
Run, goddamn it, run!

39:33.124 --> 39:35.843
At least now we know
when the next train was due.

39:45.044 --> 39:47.922
That was the all-time train dodge.
Too cool.

39:49.204 --> 39:53.595
You were so scared you looked like
Abbott Costello when he saw the mummy.

39:53.684 --> 39:55.356
I wasn't that scared.

39:56.524 --> 39:58.401
No, really, I wasn't. Sincerely.

39:58.484 --> 40:01.715
Then you won't mind if we check
your underpants for Hershey squirts.

40:01.804 --> 40:03.203
Go screw.

40:03.484 --> 40:05.156
You'd better turn yours over.

40:05.244 --> 40:07.155
This is the way I like to do it.

40:07.644 --> 40:08.633
Man!

40:09.644 --> 40:11.123
You got any more, Gordie?

40:11.204 --> 40:12.239
Sorry, Vern.

40:12.324 --> 40:14.474
It's not funny. What am I supposed to eat?

40:14.564 --> 40:17.522
- Why don't you cook your dick?
- It'd be a small meal.

40:21.644 --> 40:23.362
Screw you guys, I got it.

40:37.724 --> 40:39.840
Nothing like a smoke after a meal.

40:41.964 --> 40:43.920
I cherish these moments.

40:47.044 --> 40:48.682
What? What did I say?

40:54.084 --> 40:56.120
Gordie, why don't you tell us a story?

40:56.204 --> 40:57.398
I don't know.

40:57.484 --> 40:59.634
- Come on.
- Yeah, come on, Gordie.

41:00.284 --> 41:02.354
None of your horror stories, okay?

41:02.484 --> 41:05.681
I don't want to hear no horror stories.
I'm not up for that.

41:05.804 --> 41:09.240
Tell us one about Sergeant Steel
and his battling leathernecks.

41:09.644 --> 41:12.442
The one I've been thinking about
is kind of different.

41:12.524 --> 41:14.401
It's about this pie-eating contest.

41:14.484 --> 41:18.716
The main guy of the story is this fat kid
that nobody likes, named Davie Hogan.

41:18.844 --> 41:21.517
Like Charlie Hogan's brother, if he had one.

41:21.724 --> 41:22.839
Good, Vern.

41:24.324 --> 41:25.234
Go on.

41:26.044 --> 41:29.673
Well, this kid, he's our age, but he's fat.
Real fat.

41:30.284 --> 41:34.402
He weighs close to 180,
but it's not his fault. It's his glands.

41:34.604 --> 41:36.913
My cousin's like that. Sincerely.

41:37.164 --> 41:41.237
She weighs over 300 pounds. Supposed
to be a <i>"</i> hyboid <i>"</i> gland or somethin <i>'.</i>

41:41.604 --> 41:44.516
I don't know about any <i>"</i> hyboid <i>"</i> gland,
but what a blimp!

41:44.604 --> 41:47.323
No shit.
She looks like a Thanksgiving turkey.

41:47.404 --> 41:49.964
- And, you know, this one time...
- Shut up, Vern.

41:50.324 --> 41:52.918
Right. Go on. It's a swell story.

41:53.644 --> 41:58.718
All the kids, instead of calling him Davie,
they called him Lardass. Lardass Hogan.

41:59.044 --> 42:01.842
Even his little brother
and sister called him Lardass.

42:01.924 --> 42:05.553
At school they put this sticker on his back
that says, <i>"</i> Wide Load <i>."</i>

42:05.804 --> 42:09.319
And they rank him out and beat him up
whenever they get a chance.

42:09.564 --> 42:11.680
But one day he gets an idea.

42:12.764 --> 42:17.360
The greatest revenge idea a kid ever had.

42:19.284 --> 42:21.559
<i>Is this thing on? Can you hear me?</i>

42:22.244 --> 42:26.522
<i>The next contestant</i>
<i>in the Great Tri-County Pie Eat...</i>

42:26.604 --> 42:28.162
<i>... Principal John Wiggins.</i>

42:36.244 --> 42:40.874
<i>And our celebrity contestant,</i>
<i>from KLAM in Portland...</i>

42:41.404 --> 42:44.635
<i>... The Boss-man himself, Bob Cormier!</i>

42:48.804 --> 42:51.113
<i>From the racks and stacks</i>
<i>it's the best on wax...</i>

42:51.204 --> 42:55.083
<i>... how about another double, golden oldie,</i>
<i>sound sandwich from KLAM in Portland...</i>

42:55.164 --> 42:56.517
<i>...it's...</i>
- Boss!

43:01.764 --> 43:04.403
<i>Next, a newcomer to the Pie Eat,</i>
<i>but one we expect...</i>

43:04.484 --> 43:08.443
<i>... great things from in the future,</i>
<i>young Master David Hogan.</i>

43:13.764 --> 43:16.995
- Are you all right, young man?
- Lardass how was your trip?

43:18.684 --> 43:21.039
I hear you got a big appetite, Lardass.

43:21.924 --> 43:24.074
Don't even think about winning this.

43:25.164 --> 43:26.756
Boy are you fat.

43:28.284 --> 43:32.118
Don't pay attention to those fools,
Lardass. Davie.

43:44.484 --> 43:47.760
<i>And now,</i>
<i>the one you've all been waiting for.</i>

43:47.924 --> 43:52.236
<i>The four-time champion,</i>
<i>our own Bill Travis.</i>

43:58.004 --> 44:00.757
Listen I got $10 riding
on you myself, Billy Boy.

44:02.684 --> 44:04.322
<i>All right. Are you ready?</i>

44:05.644 --> 44:07.714
<i>Hands behind your backs, gentlemen.</i>

44:08.284 --> 44:09.433
<i>Drum roll.</i>

44:09.884 --> 44:13.433
Hey, Lardass. Chow down, Wide Load.

44:16.804 --> 44:17.680
<i>Go.</i>

44:24.444 --> 44:25.274
Done!

44:41.524 --> 44:42.354
Done!

44:44.804 --> 44:45.680
Done!

44:47.324 --> 44:50.361
You better pace yourself,
if you want to hold out.

44:50.684 --> 44:51.673
Come on, Lardass!

44:52.524 --> 44:53.593
Lardass, Lardass!

45:03.724 --> 45:07.956
What the audience didn't know, was
that Lardass wasn't interested in winning.

45:08.844 --> 45:10.596
What he wanted was revenge.

45:12.004 --> 45:15.155
And right before he was introduced,
he'd gotten ready for it.

45:16.484 --> 45:18.395
<i>... Principal John Wiggins.</i>

45:25.884 --> 45:30.275
<i>And our celebrity contestant</i>
<i>from KLAM in Portland...</i>

45:31.204 --> 45:34.435
<i>... The Bossman himself, Bob Cormier!</i>

45:38.364 --> 45:40.673
<i>From the racks and stacks</i>
<i>it's the best on wax...</i>

45:40.764 --> 45:44.677
<i>... how about another double, golden oldie,</i>
<i>sound sandwich from KLAM in Portland...</i>

45:44.764 --> 45:45.640
<i>... it's...</i>

45:45.884 --> 45:46.794
Done.

45:49.524 --> 45:53.881
<i>Diving into his fifth pie, Lardass began</i>
<i>to imagine that he wasn't eating pies.</i>

45:54.044 --> 45:56.319
<i>He pretended he was eating cowflops...</i>

45:56.604 --> 45:58.515
<i>... and rat guts in blueberry sauce.</i>

45:59.364 --> 46:00.240
Done.

46:03.324 --> 46:07.397
<i>Slowly, a sound started to build</i>
<i>in Lardass's stomach.</i>

46:08.604 --> 46:10.959
<i>A strange and scary sound...</i>

46:11.324 --> 46:14.600
<i>... like a log truck coming</i>
<i>at you at 100 miles an hour.</i>

46:27.924 --> 46:30.518
<i>Suddenly, Lardass opened his mouth...</i>

46:31.364 --> 46:33.594
<i>... and before Bill Travis knew it...</i>

46:33.804 --> 46:37.399
<i>... he was covered with five pies worth</i>
<i>of used blueberries.</i>

46:38.204 --> 46:40.320
<i>The women in the audience screamed.</i>

46:40.764 --> 46:44.916
<i>Bossman Bob Cormier took one look</i>
<i>at Bill Travis and barfed on Wiggins.</i>

46:45.684 --> 46:49.233
<i>Wiggins barfed on the lumberjack</i>
<i>that was sitting next to him.</i>

46:49.324 --> 46:51.713
<i>Mayor Grundy barfed on his wife's tits!</i>

46:52.324 --> 46:54.440
But when the smell hit the crowd...

46:55.044 --> 46:58.002
...that's when Lardass's plan
really started to work.

46:58.204 --> 46:59.922
Girlfriends barfed on boyfriends.

47:00.004 --> 47:01.676
<i>Kids barfed on their parents.</i>

47:01.764 --> 47:03.402
<i>A fat lady barfed in her purse.</i>

47:03.484 --> 47:05.395
<i>The Donelley twins barfed on each other.</i>

47:05.484 --> 47:10.274
<i>The Women's Auxiliary barfed all over</i>
<i>the Benevolent Order of Antelopes.</i>

47:10.604 --> 47:13.960
And Lardass just sat back
and enjoyed what he'd created.

47:14.804 --> 47:19.195
A complete and total barfarama.

47:26.084 --> 47:29.554
- Too cool!
- That was the best, just the best.

47:30.284 --> 47:31.717
Then what happened?

47:31.924 --> 47:33.073
What do you mean?

47:33.164 --> 47:34.836
I mean, what happened?

47:36.484 --> 47:38.998
What do you mean, <i>"</i> What happened? <i>"</i>
That's the end.

47:39.284 --> 47:43.641
How can that be the end? What kind of an
ending is that? What happens to Lardass?

47:43.724 --> 47:44.998
I don't know.

47:45.324 --> 47:48.361
Maybe he went home and celebrated
with a couple of cheeseburgers.

47:48.644 --> 47:51.158
Jesus, that ending sucks.

47:52.364 --> 47:55.117
Why don't you make it
so that Lardass goes home...

47:55.204 --> 47:56.637
...and he shoots his father.

47:56.724 --> 47:59.113
Then he runs away
and he joins the Texas Rangers.

47:59.204 --> 48:00.398
How about that?

48:00.484 --> 48:01.803
I don't know.

48:02.164 --> 48:03.836
Something good like that.

48:04.084 --> 48:06.803
I like the ending. The barfing was good.

48:07.724 --> 48:10.192
But there's one thing I didn't understand.

48:11.644 --> 48:14.397
Did Lardass have to pay
to get into the contest?

48:15.284 --> 48:17.639
No, Vern, they just let him in.

48:19.164 --> 48:21.234
Great, great story.

48:21.404 --> 48:23.964
It's a great story.
I just didn't like the ending.

48:24.044 --> 48:26.922
Where's the radio?
Let's see if we can get some sounds.

48:27.004 --> 48:27.880
Here.

48:36.084 --> 48:37.756
<i>We talked into the night.</i>

48:38.004 --> 48:41.474
<i>The kind of talk that seemed important</i>
<i>until you discover girls.</i>

48:41.684 --> 48:42.719
All right.

48:42.844 --> 48:46.837
Mickey's a Mouse. Donald's a duck.
Pluto's a dog.

48:47.844 --> 48:49.038
What's Goofy?

48:49.684 --> 48:52.357
If I could only have one food
for the rest of my life?

48:52.444 --> 48:54.400
That's easy. Pez.

48:54.844 --> 48:57.722
Cherry flavoured Pez.
No question about it.

48:58.844 --> 49:01.483
Goofy's a dog. He's definitely a dog.

49:03.204 --> 49:06.002
I knew the $64,000 Question was fixed.

49:06.084 --> 49:09.076
There's no way anybody can know
that much about opera.

49:10.164 --> 49:13.474
He can't be a dog.
He wears a hat and drives a car.

49:14.644 --> 49:16.794
<i>Wagon Train</i> is a really cool show...

49:17.044 --> 49:20.116
...but did you ever notice
that they never get anywhere?

49:20.444 --> 49:22.355
They just keep wagon training.

49:23.244 --> 49:25.235
God, that's weird.

49:25.804 --> 49:27.442
What the hell is Goofy?

49:29.804 --> 49:33.843
<i>Not one of us mentioned Ray Brower,</i>
<i>but we were all thinking about him.</i>

49:40.004 --> 49:41.198
Oh, my God.

49:41.404 --> 49:42.837
It's the Brower kid.

49:42.924 --> 49:45.154
His ghost is out walking in the woods.

49:47.644 --> 49:49.714
I promise I won't hock
no more dirty books.

49:49.804 --> 49:53.843
I promise I won't say no more bad swears.
I promise I'll eat my lima beans.

49:54.644 --> 49:56.077
Two for flinching.

50:00.484 --> 50:01.883
What is it, Chris?

50:03.084 --> 50:04.517
Maybe it's coyotes.

50:04.884 --> 50:06.761
Sounds like a woman screaming.

50:06.844 --> 50:08.994
It's not coyotes. It's his ghost.

50:09.244 --> 50:10.472
Don't say that.

50:10.764 --> 50:12.117
Teddy, sit down.

50:12.404 --> 50:14.713
I'm gonna go look for it.
I want to see the ghost.

50:14.804 --> 50:15.919
Don't say that.

50:16.004 --> 50:18.996
I just want to see it!
I just want to see what he looks like.

50:19.084 --> 50:20.802
Jesus H. Bald-headed Christ!

50:26.764 --> 50:28.755
Maybe we should stand guard.

50:29.604 --> 50:31.322
That's a good idea.

50:33.324 --> 50:35.838
Give me the gun. I'll take the first watch.

50:48.324 --> 50:52.556
23:00 hours.
Corporal Teddy Duchamp stands guard.

50:56.204 --> 50:58.957
No sign of the enemy. The fort is secure.

50:59.804 --> 51:02.238
Shut up, Teddy, and keep your eyes peeled.

51:11.524 --> 51:13.992
- Cut it out.
- I'm trying to sleep.

51:17.044 --> 51:19.114
The dogfaces rested easy...

51:19.204 --> 51:21.764
...in the knowledge that
Corporal Teddy Duchamp...

51:22.084 --> 51:24.882
...was protecting all that was dear to them.

52:55.404 --> 52:57.156
<i>It should have been you, Gordon.</i>

53:00.284 --> 53:01.478
Are you okay?

53:04.364 --> 53:05.763
You were dreaming.

53:16.244 --> 53:18.439
I didn't cry at Denny's funeral.

53:23.404 --> 53:24.803
I miss him, Chris.

53:25.404 --> 53:26.803
I really miss him.

53:28.524 --> 53:29.434
I know.

53:33.364 --> 53:34.717
Go back to sleep.

54:14.564 --> 54:17.476
Maybe you could go
into the college courses with me.

54:17.804 --> 54:19.237
That'll be the day.

54:20.084 --> 54:21.915
Why not? You're smart enough.

54:22.004 --> 54:23.403
They won't let me.

54:25.444 --> 54:26.763
What do you mean?

54:27.684 --> 54:30.357
It's the way the people think
of my family in this town.

54:30.444 --> 54:34.483
It's the way they think of me. I'm just one
of those low-life Chambers kids.

54:34.564 --> 54:35.997
That's not true.

54:36.724 --> 54:37.918
It is.

54:38.604 --> 54:41.516
No one asked me if I took the milk money.

54:42.204 --> 54:44.195
I just got a three-day vacation.

54:49.964 --> 54:51.238
Did you take it?

54:51.444 --> 54:53.878
Yeah, I took it. You knew I took it.

54:55.044 --> 54:56.557
Teddy knew I took it.

54:57.284 --> 55:00.560
Everyone knew I took it.
Even Vern knew, I think.

55:05.204 --> 55:07.798
Maybe I was sorry,
and I tried to give it back.

55:08.284 --> 55:10.002
You tried to give it back?

55:10.284 --> 55:12.434
Maybe, just maybe.

55:13.604 --> 55:17.995
Maybe I took it to Old Lady Simons
and told her, and the money was all there.

55:18.084 --> 55:21.599
But I still got a three-day vacation,
because it never showed up.

55:21.884 --> 55:24.079
And maybe the next week,
old Lady Simons...

55:24.164 --> 55:27.201
...had this brand new skirt on
when she came to school.

55:27.804 --> 55:30.272
Yeah, it was brown and it had dots on it.

55:30.884 --> 55:35.480
Let's just say that I stole the milk money,
but old Lady Simons stole it back from me.

55:35.844 --> 55:38.153
Just suppose that I told this story.

55:38.604 --> 55:41.277
Me, Chris Chambers,
kid brother to Eyeball Chambers.

55:41.364 --> 55:43.673
Do you think anyone
would have believed it?

55:43.764 --> 55:44.355
No.

55:44.444 --> 55:48.437
You think that bitch would have tried that
if it had been one of those douche bags...

55:48.724 --> 55:50.874
...from The View,
if they had taken the money?

55:50.964 --> 55:52.317
- No way.
- Hell, no.

55:53.284 --> 55:54.399
But, with me <i>...</i>

55:59.804 --> 56:02.841
I'm sure she had her eye on that skirt
for a long time.

56:03.524 --> 56:05.958
Anyway, she saw her chance
and she took it.

56:06.884 --> 56:09.842
I was the stupid one
for even trying to give it back.

56:16.644 --> 56:18.282
I just never thought <i>...</i>

56:20.484 --> 56:23.078
I never thought that a teacher <i>...</i>

56:25.124 --> 56:27.479
Who gives a fuck anyway?

56:34.124 --> 56:35.523
I just wish...

56:36.404 --> 56:39.680
...that I could go someplace
where nobody knows me.

56:51.004 --> 56:52.995
I guess I'm just a pussy.

56:53.724 --> 56:55.601
No way, man.

57:40.084 --> 57:41.915
<i>The freight woke up the other guys...</i>

57:42.004 --> 57:46.236
<i>... and it was on the tip of my tongue</i>
<i>to tell them about the deer, but I didn't.</i>

57:47.044 --> 57:49.638
<i>That was the one thing I kept to myself.</i>

57:49.884 --> 57:52.682
<i>I've never spoken or written of it</i>
<i>until just now.</i>

58:00.924 --> 58:03.484
How come you didn't get
some breakfast stuff like...

58:03.564 --> 58:05.600
...Twinkies, and Pez, and root beer?

58:06.204 --> 58:11.119
Sorry. I guess a more experienced shopper
could've gotten more for your 7 cents.

58:12.564 --> 58:16.079
<i>With our stomachs rumbling,</i>
<i>we pressed on toward the Royal River.</i>

58:16.484 --> 58:21.035
<i>The reality of Ray Brower was growing,</i>
<i>and kept us moving despite the heat.</i>

58:22.004 --> 58:24.837
<i>For me, the idea</i>
<i>of seeing that kid's dead body...</i>

58:24.924 --> 58:27.233
<i>... was starting to become an obsession.</i>

58:38.764 --> 58:40.561
Gentlemen, the Royal.

58:43.164 --> 58:45.724
God, the tracks go way out of the way.

58:46.044 --> 58:49.480
We cut across this field right here,
we'll be there in an hour.

58:50.724 --> 58:52.919
I think we should stick to the tracks.

58:53.004 --> 58:54.881
I say we go across the field.

58:55.564 --> 58:56.474
Gordie?

58:57.404 --> 58:59.042
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

58:59.604 --> 59:01.276
Take no prisoners!

59:04.084 --> 59:06.473
You guys, it's a lot safer if we <i>...</i>

59:08.284 --> 59:10.081
Come on, men. Let's take on the <i>...</i>

59:10.164 --> 59:12.359
You don't know what's in those woods.

59:15.524 --> 59:17.003
You guys, wait up for me!

59:25.924 --> 59:28.882
I gotta tell you something,
but swear on your mother's name...

59:28.964 --> 59:30.682
...that you won't tell anybody.

59:30.764 --> 59:31.833
You got it, pal.

59:34.724 --> 59:37.113
Eyeball, you know that Brower kid?

59:37.524 --> 59:38.434
What about him?

59:38.644 --> 59:42.080
I'll tell you something, but you must swear
on your mother's good name...

59:42.164 --> 59:43.392
...you won't tell nobody.

59:43.684 --> 59:47.757
<i>Billy and Charlie had managed to keep</i>
<i>their enormous secret for about 36 hours.</i>

59:48.044 --> 59:50.000
<i>A personal record for both of them.</i>

59:50.084 --> 59:53.918
<i>By noon, Ace and Eyeball had told</i>
<i>their secret to everybody in the gang.</i>

59:54.204 --> 59:58.163
<i>I guess for those guys, protecting their</i>
<i>mother's good name wasn't a top priority.</i>

59:58.244 --> 01:00:01.759
Ace, maybe me and Charlie shouldn't go.

01:00:02.084 --> 01:00:03.995
Maybe you could go without us?

01:00:04.924 --> 01:00:07.916
You guys are acting like my grandmother
having a conniption fit.

01:00:08.004 --> 01:00:09.323
I don't see your problem.

01:00:09.404 --> 01:00:12.840
We take a bunch of fishing gear,
so if a cop asks us what we're doing:

01:00:12.924 --> 01:00:17.634
<i>"</i> We're here to take a couple of steelhead
out of the river. Look what we found <i>."</i>

01:00:17.724 --> 01:00:19.919
Come on, man, we're gonna be famous.

01:00:20.044 --> 01:00:22.922
We'll be on every radio and TV show
in the country.

01:00:23.164 --> 01:00:25.234
I still don't think we should go.

01:00:25.404 --> 01:00:26.393
Okay.

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:30.274
You've stated your position clearly.

01:00:30.524 --> 01:00:32.196
Now, I'm gonna state mine.

01:00:32.764 --> 01:00:35.153
Get in the fucking car. Now!

01:00:35.324 --> 01:00:36.518
Let's go, man.

01:00:49.884 --> 01:00:52.717
- I hate this shortcut.
- <i>"</i> I hate this shortcut <i>."</i>

01:00:55.124 --> 01:00:57.797
You flinched! Two for flinching.

01:01:01.604 --> 01:01:03.037
But you flinched.

01:01:03.204 --> 01:01:05.274
I know. Two for flinching.

01:01:24.924 --> 01:01:26.835
How are we supposed to get across this?

01:01:26.924 --> 01:01:29.438
- We use you as a raft.
- Very funny.

01:01:39.644 --> 01:01:42.204
It's not that deep. We can walk across.

01:01:52.084 --> 01:01:54.678
I told you we should have stuck
to the tracks.

01:01:56.564 --> 01:01:59.601
Is it me,
or are you the world's biggest pussy?

01:02:00.444 --> 01:02:02.355
I suppose this is fun for you.

01:02:02.644 --> 01:02:04.635
No, but this is.

01:02:06.964 --> 01:02:08.192
Want some more?

01:02:09.244 --> 01:02:11.599
- Stop it, come on!
- Act your age.

01:02:11.684 --> 01:02:12.719
This is my age.

01:02:12.804 --> 01:02:15.523
I'm in the prime of my youth,
and I'll only be young once.

01:02:15.604 --> 01:02:18.357
But you're going to be stupid
for the rest of your life.

01:02:18.444 --> 01:02:21.720
That's it, Chambers.
You just signed your own death warrant.

01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:23.483
You die, Chambers!

01:02:28.164 --> 01:02:29.563
Get him, Chambers!

01:02:30.244 --> 01:02:33.395
- Vern's afraid he's gonna die!
- Teddy, you're gonna die!

01:02:36.844 --> 01:02:39.233
Where do you think
you're going, Lachance?

01:02:39.964 --> 01:02:41.363
Come on, you guys.

01:02:42.044 --> 01:02:43.079
Pile on!

01:02:44.884 --> 01:02:46.522
I don't want to do this.

01:02:48.084 --> 01:02:49.153
Get off!

01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:52.993
- Sleeper hold.
- Stop it. I'm serious.

01:02:53.084 --> 01:02:55.518
No one gets out of the sleeper hold.

01:02:55.604 --> 01:02:59.643
- Vern, there's something on your neck.
- I'm not falling for that one, Lachance.

01:02:59.724 --> 01:03:01.521
No, there is something on your neck.

01:03:01.684 --> 01:03:03.675
It's a leech. Leeches!

01:03:03.844 --> 01:03:05.277
- Oh, my God!
- Leeches!

01:03:18.884 --> 01:03:20.158
Get them off!

01:03:20.324 --> 01:03:21.439
Lay off me!

01:03:23.364 --> 01:03:26.401
- Gordie, there's some on your back.
- Get them off!

01:03:28.044 --> 01:03:29.602
Are there any on mine?

01:03:50.484 --> 01:03:51.837
Oh, shit, Chris.

01:03:54.284 --> 01:03:55.558
Oh, shit, man.

01:04:17.084 --> 01:04:18.563
Are you okay?

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:21.843
Can you hear me?

01:04:22.804 --> 01:04:23.998
Are you there?

01:04:24.404 --> 01:04:25.598
Maybe he's dead.

01:04:25.684 --> 01:04:27.834
He's not dead. He's still breathing, idiot.

01:04:27.924 --> 01:04:28.913
I don't know.

01:04:29.324 --> 01:04:31.758
Just cool it, you guys. He just fainted.

01:04:36.404 --> 01:04:38.838
I never met anybody who fainted before.

01:04:40.284 --> 01:04:42.923
Maybe he made a bad mistake
and looked at your face.

01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:44.403
Shut up, Teddy.

01:04:44.924 --> 01:04:45.959
You okay?

01:04:47.324 --> 01:04:48.757
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

01:04:54.644 --> 01:04:56.396
Maybe we should take Gordie back.

01:04:56.484 --> 01:04:59.157
Great, Chambers,
now you're turning pussy, too!

01:04:59.284 --> 01:05:02.594
What's your problem?
He had a leech on his balls. He fainted.

01:05:02.684 --> 01:05:03.833
Are you his mother?

01:05:03.924 --> 01:05:05.721
- Eat shit.
- You eat shit.

01:05:07.124 --> 01:05:09.433
I think Chris is right. Let's go back.

01:05:10.044 --> 01:05:13.161
What a surprise! The king of the pussies
wants to go back, too.

01:05:13.244 --> 01:05:15.360
- Stop calling me that.
- What, <i>"</i> pussy <i>"</i> ? Pussy!

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:16.957
- Stop it!
- Pussy!

01:05:17.044 --> 01:05:18.602
You four-eyed psycho!

01:05:19.004 --> 01:05:20.119
Get off me!

01:05:21.324 --> 01:05:24.316
Two for flinching.
Do I get two for flinching?

01:05:24.404 --> 01:05:25.598
You like it, Teddy?

01:05:25.684 --> 01:05:28.437
- Come on, you guys. Break it up.
- Stop it!

01:05:37.484 --> 01:05:38.917
I'm not going back.

01:05:43.644 --> 01:05:45.919
- Idiot.
- Shut up! Retard.

01:05:50.964 --> 01:05:54.559
<i>At the time, I didn't know why I needed</i>
<i>to see that body so badly.</i>

01:05:55.044 --> 01:05:58.275
<i>Even if no one had followed me,</i>
<i>I would have gone on alone.</i>

01:06:10.964 --> 01:06:13.637
No way, Ace! Not this time, man.
No way!

01:06:13.724 --> 01:06:16.158
- Go for it, Vince.
- You want to race?

01:06:26.924 --> 01:06:28.721
Oh, my God, I got him.

01:06:31.164 --> 01:06:33.200
You are history. History!

01:06:33.524 --> 01:06:35.719
- Fall back, Ace.
- Don't fuck around.

01:06:39.604 --> 01:06:41.674
Jesus Christ, Ace! Fall back, man!

01:06:57.804 --> 01:06:59.396
Shit, man! Shit!

01:06:59.844 --> 01:07:00.754
I won.

01:07:02.644 --> 01:07:05.033
You let him beat you, you cock-knocker.

01:07:14.604 --> 01:07:17.596
Coming though the woods,
I bet we saved over an hour.

01:07:23.124 --> 01:07:25.035
Is this the Back Harlow Road?

01:07:27.804 --> 01:07:29.954
The Brower kid must be
around here someplace.

01:07:30.044 --> 01:07:32.319
Teddy and Vern
watch the left side of the tracks.

01:07:32.404 --> 01:07:34.474
- We'll take the right.
- All right.

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:49.520
There he is! I see him! Look!

01:07:49.604 --> 01:07:51.674
Look over there! I see him!

01:07:54.724 --> 01:07:56.396
<i>None of us could breathe.</i>

01:07:56.964 --> 01:08:00.115
<i>Somewhere under those bushes</i>
<i>was the rest of Ray Brower.</i>

01:08:12.244 --> 01:08:14.599
<i>The train had knocked Ray</i>
<i>out of his Keds...</i>

01:08:14.684 --> 01:08:17.482
<i>... just like it had knocked the life</i>
<i>out of his body.</i>

01:08:17.564 --> 01:08:18.519
Jesus.

01:08:20.724 --> 01:08:22.203
<i>The kid wasn't sick.</i>

01:08:22.764 --> 01:08:24.402
<i>The kid wasn't sleeping.</i>

01:08:25.323 --> 01:08:26.676
<i>The kid was dead.</i>

01:08:41.684 --> 01:08:45.120
Let's look for some long branches.
We'll build him a stretcher.

01:08:57.844 --> 01:08:58.799
Gordie?

01:09:07.044 --> 01:09:08.716
Why did you have to die?

01:09:09.804 --> 01:09:11.362
What's the matter with Gordie?

01:09:11.444 --> 01:09:12.479
Nothing.

01:09:12.724 --> 01:09:15.363
You guys just go over there
and look for some branches?

01:09:15.444 --> 01:09:16.115
Okay.

01:09:27.884 --> 01:09:29.795
Why did he have to die, Chris?

01:09:30.604 --> 01:09:33.640
Why did Denny have to die? Why?

01:09:35.924 --> 01:09:37.118
I don't know.

01:09:38.804 --> 01:09:40.999
- It should have been me.
- Don't say that.

01:09:41.084 --> 01:09:43.644
- It should have been me.
- Don't say that, man.

01:09:45.163 --> 01:09:48.554
I'm no good. My dad said it. I'm no good.

01:09:48.724 --> 01:09:50.203
He doesn't know you.

01:09:51.644 --> 01:09:52.712
He hates me.

01:09:52.804 --> 01:09:54.237
He doesn't hate you.

01:09:55.084 --> 01:09:56.676
- He hates me.
- No.

01:09:56.844 --> 01:09:58.516
He just doesn't know you.

01:09:58.844 --> 01:10:01.836
He hates me. My dad hates me.

01:10:02.964 --> 01:10:05.842
He hates me. Oh, God.

01:10:28.404 --> 01:10:30.872
You're gonna be a great writer someday.

01:10:32.684 --> 01:10:36.597
You might even write about us guys,
if you ever get hard-up for material.

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:56.723
I guess I'd have to be pretty hard-up?

01:10:59.444 --> 01:11:00.320
Yeah.

01:11:03.684 --> 01:11:05.914
What the fuck do you know about this?

01:11:06.844 --> 01:11:09.119
Son of a bitch! My little brother.

01:11:12.044 --> 01:11:15.434
You wasn't planning on taking
the body from us, was you, boys?

01:11:17.124 --> 01:11:18.523
You get away.

01:11:18.644 --> 01:11:20.396
We found him. We got dibs.

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:24.602
We better start running, Eyeball.
They got dibs.

01:11:24.724 --> 01:11:28.399
We earned him. You guys came in a car.
That's not fair. He's ours.

01:11:28.524 --> 01:11:30.321
<i>"</i> That's not fair. He's ours <i>."</i>

01:11:30.924 --> 01:11:32.323
Well, not anymore.

01:11:32.564 --> 01:11:35.601
There are four of us, Eyeball.
You just make your move.

01:11:35.804 --> 01:11:37.635
We will. Don't you worry.

01:11:42.204 --> 01:11:44.843
Vern, you little son of a whore.

01:11:44.924 --> 01:11:48.121
- You was under the porch.
- No, I swear it wasn't me.

01:11:48.444 --> 01:11:51.800
You keyhole-peeping bung.
I ought to beat the living shit out of you.

01:11:58.244 --> 01:11:59.962
You guys have two choices.

01:12:01.204 --> 01:12:03.718
Either leave quietly and we take the body...

01:12:04.244 --> 01:12:06.917
...or you stay
and we beat the shit out of you.

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:08.837
And we take the body.

01:12:08.924 --> 01:12:12.473
- Besides, me and Billy found him first.
- Vern told us how you found him.

01:12:12.564 --> 01:12:15.795
<i>"</i> Billy, I wish we'd never boosted that car <i>."</i>

01:12:16.004 --> 01:12:19.963
<i>"</i> Billy, I think I just turned
my Fruit of the Looms into fudge factory <i>."</i>

01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:22.433
- That's it. Your ass is grass!
- Hold it.

01:12:25.804 --> 01:12:29.160
Okay, Chambers, you little faggot.
This is your last chance.

01:12:30.804 --> 01:12:32.317
What do you say, kid?

01:12:33.684 --> 01:12:36.642
Why don't you go home
and fuck your mother some more?

01:12:41.164 --> 01:12:42.313
You're dead.

01:12:43.084 --> 01:12:44.563
Come on, let's split.

01:12:45.004 --> 01:12:47.359
- They're not taking him.
- Come on, this is crazy.

01:12:47.444 --> 01:12:49.753
- They're not taking him.
- He's got a knife, man.

01:12:50.644 --> 01:12:52.077
Ace, come on.

01:12:57.204 --> 01:12:59.160
You're gonna have to kill me, Ace.

01:12:59.244 --> 01:13:00.438
No problem.

01:13:13.684 --> 01:13:16.756
You're not taking him.
Nobody's taking him.

01:13:18.804 --> 01:13:22.274
Come on, kid, just give me the gun
before you take your foot off.

01:13:23.644 --> 01:13:26.158
You ain't got the sack
to shoot a woodchuck.

01:13:27.324 --> 01:13:28.643
Don't move, Ace.

01:13:30.604 --> 01:13:32.515
I'll kill you. I swear to God.

01:13:34.724 --> 01:13:36.919
Come on, Lachance, give me the gun.

01:13:39.284 --> 01:13:42.356
You must have at least some
of your brother's good sense.

01:13:46.284 --> 01:13:50.675
Suck my fat one,
you cheap dime-store hood.

01:13:57.244 --> 01:13:59.553
What are you going to do, shoot us all?

01:13:59.804 --> 01:14:01.920
No, just you.

01:14:12.364 --> 01:14:14.241
We're gonna get you for this.

01:14:14.644 --> 01:14:16.760
Maybe you will and maybe you won't.

01:14:17.324 --> 01:14:18.552
We will.

01:14:30.764 --> 01:14:34.154
We're not going to forget this,
if that's what you're thinking.

01:14:34.884 --> 01:14:36.522
This is big time, baby.

01:14:52.964 --> 01:14:54.556
<i>"</i> Suck my fat one <i>"</i> ?

01:14:55.924 --> 01:14:58.518
Whoever told you,
you had a fat one, Lachance?

01:15:00.004 --> 01:15:01.835
Biggest one in four counties.

01:15:19.324 --> 01:15:20.996
Are we going to take him?

01:15:21.404 --> 01:15:22.154
No.

01:15:24.364 --> 01:15:26.036
But we came all this way?

01:15:27.044 --> 01:15:28.875
We're supposed to be heroes.

01:15:30.404 --> 01:15:31.883
Not this way, Teddy.

01:15:35.284 --> 01:15:37.115
Chris, give me a hand.

01:15:39.804 --> 01:15:41.601
<i>Ray Brower's body was found...</i>

01:15:41.684 --> 01:15:44.642
<i>... but neither our gang</i>
<i>nor their gang got the credit.</i>

01:15:45.164 --> 01:15:48.952
<i>We decided that an anonymous phone call</i>
<i>was the best thing to do.</i>

01:15:55.084 --> 01:15:58.872
<i>We headed home. And although</i>
<i>many thoughts raced through our minds...</i>

01:15:59.444 --> 01:16:01.036
<i>... we barely spoke.</i>

01:16:04.644 --> 01:16:07.363
<i>We walked all night</i>
<i>and made it back to Castle Rock...</i>

01:16:07.444 --> 01:16:11.995
<i>... a little past 5:00 on Sunday morning,</i>
<i>the day before Labour Day.</i>

01:16:13.244 --> 01:16:17.362
<i>We'd only been gone two days,</i>
<i>but somehow the town seemed different...</i>

01:16:17.884 --> 01:16:19.237
<i>... smaller.</i>

01:16:37.244 --> 01:16:38.563
See you in school.

01:16:42.524 --> 01:16:44.162
See you in Junior High.

01:16:57.684 --> 01:16:58.639
Penny.

01:17:07.084 --> 01:17:10.963
I better get home, before my mom
puts me on the <i>"</i> 10 Most Wanted List <i>."</i>

01:17:21.684 --> 01:17:23.322
No hard feelings, okay?

01:17:24.204 --> 01:17:25.353
No way, man.

01:17:48.924 --> 01:17:52.075
<i>As time went on we saw less and less</i>
<i>of Teddy and Vern...</i>

01:17:52.644 --> 01:17:56.239
<i>... until eventually they became</i>
<i>just two more faces in the halls.</i>

01:17:56.364 --> 01:17:57.877
<i>It happens sometimes.</i>

01:17:58.044 --> 01:18:01.559
<i>Friends come in and out of your life</i>
<i>like busboys in a restaurant.</i>

01:18:02.084 --> 01:18:05.474
<i>I heard that Vern got married</i>
<i>out of high school, had four kids...</i>

01:18:05.564 --> 01:18:09.079
<i>... and is now the forklift operator</i>
<i>at the Arsenault Lumber Yard.</i>

01:18:09.444 --> 01:18:13.483
<i>Teddy tried to get into the Army,</i>
<i>but his eyes and his ear kept him out.</i>

01:18:13.724 --> 01:18:15.919
<i>Last I'd heard</i>
<i>he'd spent some time in jail...</i>

01:18:16.004 --> 01:18:18.757
<i>... and was now doing odd jobs</i>
<i>around Castle Rock.</i>

01:18:26.884 --> 01:18:29.762
I'm never gonna get out of this town,
am I, Gordie?

01:18:31.404 --> 01:18:33.474
You can do anything you want, man.

01:18:36.604 --> 01:18:37.480
Sure.

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:47.123
Give me some skin.

01:18:56.044 --> 01:18:57.193
I'll see you.

01:18:57.684 --> 01:18:59.322
Not if I see you first.

01:19:04.044 --> 01:19:05.443
<i>Chris did get out.</i>

01:19:05.564 --> 01:19:07.680
<i>He enrolled in the college courses with me.</i>

01:19:07.764 --> 01:19:11.154
<i>And although it was hard,</i>
<i>he gutted it out like he always did.</i>

01:19:11.284 --> 01:19:14.242
<i>He went on to college</i>
<i>and eventually became a lawyer.</i>

01:19:14.924 --> 01:19:17.518
<i>Last week,</i>
<i>he entered a fast-food restaurant.</i>

01:19:17.924 --> 01:19:20.643
<i>Just ahead of him,</i>
<i>two men got into an argument.</i>
