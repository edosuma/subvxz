00:21.460 --> 00:23.580
This has AIDS, it's from Africa.

00:24.260 --> 00:25.460
You're in shock.

00:25.540 --> 00:28.060
You've been injected with a
hypodermic possibly exposed to HIV.

00:28.260 --> 00:31.580
Now a woman and her baby
halfway across the world are at risk.

00:33.740 --> 00:35.020
Nobody knows that I quit.

00:35.220 --> 00:36.780
NORBAC would have been finished.

00:36.860 --> 00:38.980
We had a vaccine to design.
Where were you?

00:39.420 --> 00:40.780
You bailed on your own lab.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.700
We've compared the protein structure

00:42.860 --> 00:45.620
of your particular strain
with every available HIV drug.

00:45.980 --> 00:48.260
It's predicted to be
resistant to all of them.

00:48.860 --> 00:49.980
All of them?

00:50.140 --> 00:52.340
Kids ate a chicken poisoned with prions.

00:52.540 --> 00:54.220
Yeah, I remember that
whole mad cow disease scare.

00:54.340 --> 00:56.780
- I found I.Q. spikes.
- Where are you going next with this?

00:56.940 --> 00:58.820
Well, I've read about
a British neuroscientist

00:58.980 --> 01:00.940
who's been working with people
exposed to mad cow.

01:01.100 --> 01:04.860
Jack, we're trying to trace back
the strain before Sean to patient zero.

01:05.740 --> 01:08.380
David, we've been infecting
the cells in culture

01:08.500 --> 01:10.100
- with Audrey's HIV.
- Bob, what's the matter?

01:10.660 --> 01:13.700
I'm telling you she needs
to have her baby out right away.

01:14.260 --> 01:16.100
The baby's CD4 count.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.100
HIV.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.540
<i>- What?
- David.</i>

03:17.740 --> 03:20.540
Carlos, it's 3 o'clock
in the fucking morning. What's going on?

03:20.820 --> 03:22.100
<i>Let me in, David.</i>

03:22.220 --> 03:23.420
Are you all right?

03:24.380 --> 03:25.460
Carlos?

03:38.260 --> 03:41.780
So I just thought...
David, I was just all right.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.260
That's what happens when you drink.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.180
Talk to me.

03:53.700 --> 03:56.020
I need to...
I need to leave all this.

03:56.140 --> 03:58.300
- My job, NORBAC, Canada.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,

03:58.580 --> 04:00.020
Carlos. What's going on?

04:00.140 --> 04:02.140
I have to go back to Africa, David.

04:02.340 --> 04:05.780
There are people dying there.
They need me.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.300
They needed doctors 4 years ago,
why'd you leave then?

04:11.100 --> 04:13.900
I couldn't breathe,
I had to get out.

04:14.260 --> 04:16.300
- I know the feeling.
- Okay, then you...

04:16.459 --> 04:19.100
you know the feeling of when
it's time to return.

04:19.339 --> 04:22.620
You left the lab
and now you came back,

04:22.740 --> 04:24.820
and I need to go back to Africa.

04:30.260 --> 04:32.140
What happened to you over there?

04:34.700 --> 04:36.740
Why couldn't you breathe, Carlos?

04:39.340 --> 04:41.020
I'm sorry.

04:41.540 --> 04:43.180
I'm sorry.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.300
I'm so sorry.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.100
No!

05:14.980 --> 05:17.500
2.03 - The Cocktail

05:26.420 --> 05:28.220
Want anything in it?

05:28.380 --> 05:29.500
Sorry?

05:29.900 --> 05:32.620
Coffee, do you want anything in it?
Sugar, honey,

05:32.740 --> 05:34.180
hair of the dog?

05:34.860 --> 05:36.580
Black, thank you.

05:40.020 --> 05:41.820
I can't let you go, Carlos.

05:41.940 --> 05:43.420
Not right now, okay?

05:43.620 --> 05:45.940
We get through this, we'll talk,
and I promise you,

05:46.060 --> 05:48.740
whatever you decide is best for yourself,
I will get behind it.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.140
Do you have any clam juice?

05:53.300 --> 05:54.620
Doesn't everybody?

05:56.500 --> 05:58.340
And baking soda,

05:58.500 --> 06:01.020
and bitters, and aspirin, please.

06:19.940 --> 06:21.780
I thought you didn't get hangovers.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.260
When I do, I do.

06:23.340 --> 06:24.660
That thing really work?

06:27.340 --> 06:30.100
My father's recipe. It clears the head,

06:30.260 --> 06:32.940
dulls the pain, good for indigestion.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.580
I'll ve to try it sometime.

06:37.300 --> 06:39.380
Clam juice with baking soda...

06:42.180 --> 06:43.820
bitters and aspirin.

06:45.980 --> 06:47.300
What?

06:48.380 --> 06:50.140
Your father's a fucking genius.

06:50.460 --> 06:52.420
Drink up.
We got a lot of work to do.

06:54.020 --> 06:56.060
Well, we tried every HIV
drug on the planet.

06:56.180 --> 06:58.900
Yes, but we haven't tried
every drug on the planet.

06:59.140 --> 07:01.300
You think you can stop
HIV with aspirin?

07:01.420 --> 07:02.460
Maybe, maybe.

07:02.620 --> 07:05.660
There are many drugs made to solve one
problem later discovered to solve another.

07:05.860 --> 07:08.580
Right, so we take
our most promising HIV cocktail,

07:08.700 --> 07:11.860
the one with Tenofovir and Viracept,
and we add Viagra to it.

07:12.020 --> 07:14.860
We add Tylenol, we add epilepsy meds,
we add everything.

07:15.140 --> 07:17.140
David, there are like 10,000 drugs

07:17.220 --> 07:19.460
out there, including
behind and over the counter.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.700
Yeah, what's your point?

07:21.300 --> 07:23.740
Well, one,
to get this done in 2 days,

07:23.860 --> 07:26.420
- we don't have the manpower.
- We don't have enough Petri dishes.

07:26.540 --> 07:29.060
And 2, we can't possibly get that
many drugs here by this afternoon.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.460
Then we get as many
as humanly possible.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.220
- It's crazy.
- Thank you.

07:33.980 --> 07:36.220
I'll contact as many labs as I can.

07:36.780 --> 07:37.660
What?

07:38.140 --> 07:39.580
- What?
- What?

07:42.140 --> 07:44.260
Well, would it be logical to start

07:44.420 --> 07:47.740
with the anti-inflammatories
to curb the element of HIV? No?

07:47.860 --> 07:51.340
Viagra was made for angina, right?
It turns out it gave men big woodies.

07:51.460 --> 07:54.740
Now, is there a connection between
angina and big woodies? I don't think so.

07:54.940 --> 07:55.820
So...

07:55.860 --> 07:58.300
So, logically we assume
that there is no logic.

07:58.420 --> 07:59.740
We try every drug.

08:02.620 --> 08:04.140
- It's still crazy.
- Yes it is.

08:04.260 --> 08:07.100
But you know what? Sometimes,
some pretty cool shit happens by accident,

08:07.220 --> 08:08.820
so  let's go look for an accident.

08:09.540 --> 08:11.260
What have we got to lose, right?

08:31.580 --> 08:32.460
Bob...

08:33.140 --> 08:36.220
- The baby will be HIV positive in 2 days.
- Two days?

08:36.380 --> 08:38.659
Yeah, if he follows the same
rate of infection as Audrey.

08:38.780 --> 08:41.419
I mean, he could go even sooner.
His immune system isn't fully developed.

08:41.659 --> 08:42.780
-  Wow.
- Yeah.

08:42.860 --> 08:45.500
David, this is a list of all the prescription

08:45.580 --> 08:47.380
and non-prescription drugs
we can get our hands on.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.180
Okay, thanks, Wes.
Bob, take a look at that.

08:49.260 --> 08:51.020
Which labs are helping us?

08:51.580 --> 08:53.260
All these labs
are available for help?

08:53.340 --> 08:55.060
They're clearing their plates.
Apparently we have some pull.

08:55.220 --> 08:58.060
Audrey Graves has pull.
They understand the time crunch?

08:58.260 --> 08:59.900
- I made it very clear.
- Bob.

09:01.060 --> 09:02.140
Mix and match

09:02.260 --> 09:05.500
with their most promising HIV cocktail
and divide the total by 16 labs,

09:05.620 --> 09:07.580
taking into consideration
each lab's manpower.

09:07.860 --> 09:08.980
Hold on.

09:09.060 --> 09:12.580
We get 5,081 combinations.
Aberhold-Shard gets 260,

09:12.700 --> 09:14.860
Ace Bioneer gets 300...

09:15.060 --> 09:16.380
- Bob.
- Hmm?

09:16.500 --> 09:18.260
Let's get the dish totals
to Wes ASAP,

09:18.340 --> 09:20.100
- and get to work on our own dishes.
- Sure.

09:27.140 --> 09:30.780
Looks like little Sam there has
mastered occlusion and perspective.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.660
Is that that unusual?

09:32.780 --> 09:34.340
Uh, he's seven.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.780
Oh, I love kid's art.

09:37.180 --> 09:38.660
Look at this one.

09:41.940 --> 09:43.620
Uh, can't figure it out.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.940
I think it's a ceiling fan.
He drew the parts disassembled.

09:47.700 --> 09:48.620
Wow.

09:48.820 --> 09:51.700
Hello, I'm principal Oakley.
You're the people from NORBAC.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.100
Yes, Mayko Tran.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.620
Hey, I'm Simon Jessup.

09:55.060 --> 09:57.220
I understand you may have
some good news for us.

09:57.340 --> 09:59.900
We hope so.
We have evidence that 1 in 4 of the kids

10:00.060 --> 10:02.060
who ate the prion contaminated
chicken last year

10:02.220 --> 10:03.620
are showing dramatic spikes in I.Q.

10:04.300 --> 10:07.020
- You mean they may actually be better off?
- Well...

10:07.180 --> 10:09.820
- We'll know more when we've done a few tests.
- Of course.

10:10.340 --> 10:11.700
If there's anything you need...

10:11.820 --> 10:14.460
Just a few bouncing bundles of joy.

10:15.460 --> 10:18.420
There's something just
as important as finding the right cocktail.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.380
- What?
- Getting it to Africa in time

10:20.500 --> 10:21.980
to put the
brakes on this strain.

10:22.100 --> 10:24.500
It'll take years for it to get
through all the regulatory hoops.

10:24.660 --> 10:26.260
Then I'll take it there myself.

10:26.340 --> 10:28.900
You really think the American drug
industry's gonna let this out in the world

10:28.980 --> 10:30.700
without American companies
profiting from it?

10:31.100 --> 10:34.540
You know, it's all going to be pointless
if we cannot find the origin of this strain.

10:34.660 --> 10:36.820
Nah, I'll tell you what.
You find patient zero,

10:36.900 --> 10:38.580
I'll find a way to get
the drugs to Africa.

10:38.780 --> 10:40.100
You got a deal.

10:42.940 --> 10:44.260
How's it going?

10:44.460 --> 10:46.580
- We're missing Galantamine.
- I ordered it, David.

10:46.740 --> 10:48.620
I know you want every drug.
I know I ordered it.

10:48.860 --> 10:50.220
I don't see it, Bob.

10:50.300 --> 10:52.060
I know the whole point of this experiment

10:52.140 --> 10:54.500
is that we try every drug
we can get, and Galantamine

10:54.620 --> 10:57.300
is in a class of
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors

10:57.420 --> 11:00.100
that we are going to use.
I know I ordered it.

11:00.220 --> 11:02.380
Bob, Bob, get somebody
down to this clinic, okay?

11:02.420 --> 11:04.580
- They'll have it, it'll be fine.
- Okay, David.

11:04.740 --> 11:06.980
No, I'll go myself.

11:07.220 --> 11:09.060
I'm sorry about the mix-up.

11:51.740 --> 11:54.820
There you go. I told you
your brain wouldn't explode, didn't I?

11:55.020 --> 11:57.900
Though a little bit did
melt out your ear.

12:00.180 --> 12:02.620
- You talk weird.
- Oh dear, shame.

12:03.740 --> 12:05.940
That's another one
we're gonna have to guillotine.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.820
You do have a way with kids.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.420
- A strange way, but...
- I love kids.

12:13.540 --> 12:15.780
I'm still one myself.
How many more do we have to see?

12:15.860 --> 12:17.980
Uh, about 30 more.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.460
I hate kids.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.020
I hope the next one
doesn't smell like frogs too.

12:24.260 --> 12:26.620
Hello, please come in.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.940
Ruby McGhee... Oh, there you are.

12:53.660 --> 12:56.620
Okay, Ruby, so this is kind of like a...

12:56.700 --> 12:59.260
a brain beauty contest,
all right?

12:59.420 --> 13:02.620
And the more flashy colours
that we see on our computer,

13:02.780 --> 13:04.020
the better.

13:04.380 --> 13:06.020
And it helps if you wear the magic hat.

13:06.180 --> 13:08.620
Electroencephalogram helmet.

13:11.100 --> 13:12.540
Right, yes.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.220
- I read about it in a magazine.
- Wow,

13:16.300 --> 13:18.820
Tiger Beat sure has changed from
when I was a little girl.

13:18.980 --> 13:20.420
I don't read Tiger Beat.

13:29.660 --> 13:33.300
Okay, Ruby, you want to try to tell me
everything you remember about the picture?

13:33.820 --> 13:37.860
All right. There were 3 kids
swinging on a tire swing.

13:38.020 --> 13:39.340
That's right.

13:40.020 --> 13:44.500
And there was 3 men jogging,
all with their left foot forward.

13:44.940 --> 13:46.380
That's very good.

13:46.700 --> 13:50.460
And one had a white baseball hat,

13:50.580 --> 13:52.820
and the other had a jacket.

13:55.700 --> 13:56.940
Anything  else?

13:57.140 --> 13:58.900
Do you want me to tell you everything?

13:59.420 --> 14:00.380
Hmm...

14:01.660 --> 14:02.700
Sure.

14:03.180 --> 14:04.140
Okay...

14:04.540 --> 14:08.780
There was someone
in the playground holding...

14:09.700 --> 14:11.460
3...  4 balloons,

14:12.100 --> 14:15.180
2 were red, 1 was orange,
and 1 was yellow.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.140
The orange one had the longest string.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.300
There's a place to play in the water,

14:19.980 --> 14:23.140
and these 3 boys who are way too
old be playing in the playground

14:24.100 --> 14:26.500
were standing in misty spray things,

14:26.740 --> 14:29.580
and these 2 little babies
were waiting for their turn.

14:29.900 --> 14:33.180
And in the sky
there were 2 clouds, 1 kite

14:33.300 --> 14:35.980
with 2 tails and...

14:37.820 --> 14:40.460
3 lamps with 2 lights each.

14:51.980 --> 14:54.660
- Hey.
- Okay, so we got the Galantamine,

14:54.860 --> 14:56.420
Accupril, Benazepril,

14:56.500 --> 14:58.300
Calan, Digitoxin, Lanoxin...

14:58.460 --> 15:00.900
- Herdofoxen.
- ... Xanax, Ritalin,

15:01.100 --> 15:02.540
Dilantin, Trimethadione,

15:02.700 --> 15:05.020
all the antibiotics,
manpower at all the other labs

15:05.140 --> 15:07.860
and a giant robotic arm
at Jarrell Pharmaceuticals.

15:09.300 --> 15:12.180
What's 11,291 times 16, divided by 7?

15:12.580 --> 15:14.780
25,808, why?

15:15.020 --> 15:18.460
- Did I miss something?
- No. I was just kidding.

15:20.860 --> 15:23.180
Okay Ruby, thank you very much.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.980
So I'm not gonna die?

15:25.740 --> 15:27.900
Ruby, you're not even sick.

15:28.380 --> 15:29.940
Then let's go home.

15:30.740 --> 15:33.500
- Where's your backpack?
- In my classroom.

15:33.540 --> 15:35.900
Why don't you go get it
and I'll meet you in the hall?

15:35.940 --> 15:38.100
- All right.
- See you later, Ruby.

15:38.220 --> 15:39.900
- Ciao, Ruby.
- Bye!

15:41.060 --> 15:42.860
- Can I ask you something?
- Please.

15:43.300 --> 15:46.980
Ruby ate all that
infected chicken last year

15:47.100 --> 15:50.220
and ever since
she's been poked and prodded...

15:50.660 --> 15:53.420
MRIs, blood tests, X-Rays.

15:54.860 --> 15:57.900
It's been 6 months and
no one has any answers.

15:59.140 --> 16:01.380
Well, it's just that right now,

16:01.500 --> 16:04.780
there's no way to tell for certain
whether someone exposed to prion disease

16:04.860 --> 16:06.780
actually has the disease.

16:07.340 --> 16:10.500
Ruby gets a runny nose, coughs...

16:10.780 --> 16:13.420
and I start thinking this is it,

16:13.580 --> 16:15.300
She's gonna die.

16:16.220 --> 16:17.780
We need answers,

16:17.900 --> 16:18.940
please.

16:49.580 --> 16:52.900
So, the drugs are doing their drug
thing, we'll check 'em in 12 hours.

16:53.060 --> 16:55.780
- How's it going with patient zero?
- Slow.

16:56.060 --> 16:57.700
Sean moved around a lot.

16:57.860 --> 17:01.100
It seems he met a lot of different people
in a lot of different places.

17:02.900 --> 17:04.300
How are you holding up?

17:04.859 --> 17:07.859
Okay. It's hard to sleep these days.

17:08.180 --> 17:10.420
You know they've got drugs for that.
In fact, Bob's got

17:10.540 --> 17:12.660
all of them over there.

17:15.859 --> 17:16.700
Goodnight.
- Okay.

17:19.900 --> 17:23.220
- Carlos.
- Wes, let me ask you something.

17:24.619 --> 17:25.980
Sean sent these 2 emails
in the last month.

17:26.140 --> 17:28.380
Does not say
where they were from.

17:28.540 --> 17:30.980
Is it possible to trace what
computer they were sent from?

17:31.140 --> 17:33.180
Sure, forensic email tracing.

17:33.460 --> 17:35.300
Well, this shouldn't be a problem
at all. What are you thinking?

17:35.380 --> 17:38.260
This girl is in 2 of the pictures.
One was sent late at night,

17:38.380 --> 17:40.460
the other very early
in the morning, and...

17:40.820 --> 17:42.620
Sean seems happy in them.

17:44.260 --> 17:45.580
She's very pretty.

17:46.260 --> 17:49.180
Just  a hunch, but if you
find something, let me know.

17:49.460 --> 17:50.340
Sure.

17:51.700 --> 17:53.180
Thank you.

18:00.940 --> 18:04.620
A quarter of the kids had
bloody amazing beta activity.

18:04.780 --> 18:06.060
Come see.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.140
Look at that.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.020
Tiny little hippocampuses,

18:13.140 --> 18:15.420
and dentate gyri firing away,
so cute.

18:15.620 --> 18:19.260
So it's not overall I.Q. that's higher,
it's visual memory.

18:19.340 --> 18:21.340
Right, yeah.
That's mostly where it's occurring.

18:21.460 --> 18:24.100
Okay, where is Ruby McGhee's PET output?

18:26.060 --> 18:27.260
Here.

18:28.380 --> 18:31.580
I mean, her right hemisphere
alone could power 5 city blocks.

18:31.780 --> 18:35.220
Your "live, die or thrive"
theory might need to be adjusted.

18:35.700 --> 18:38.500
It seems that with prion
poisoning some live,

18:38.620 --> 18:39.700
some die,

18:39.900 --> 18:43.020
and some become
bloody visual geniuses.

18:43.180 --> 18:44.780
Well, it's still early stages.

18:44.940 --> 18:46.460
Right, well, I mean,

18:47.900 --> 18:49.460
we're off to a great start.

18:55.020 --> 18:56.540
Uh, yeah. Well...

18:58.100 --> 19:00.980
Okay, I will see you tomorrow.

19:05.540 --> 19:06.940
All right.
Tomorrow, then.

19:22.140 --> 19:25.020
- It's not time.
- What? It's close enough.

19:26.140 --> 19:28.300
We have to let the drugs
work for 12 hours.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.940
Bob, it's been 12 hours minus what?
Ten big fat minutes?

19:30.980 --> 19:32.540
I'm checking the dishes.

19:33.060 --> 19:34.260
Wait.

19:59.580 --> 20:01.180
Are the viruses
thriving in the cells?

20:01.300 --> 20:02.620
Yeah, so far.

20:02.740 --> 20:04.780
Wait a sec. David. David, David, David.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.140
We have a winner.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.380
- It works, one of the cocktails.
- No shit?

20:08.580 --> 20:11.740
Yeah, none. It halts replication
of Audrey's HIV.

20:11.900 --> 20:14.900
A drug from a clinical trial
and a couple of existing HIV drugs.

20:15.020 --> 20:17.300
- This is a non-HIV drug.
- Freaking Paroxetine.

20:17.460 --> 20:19.100
And antidepressant, eh?

20:19.300 --> 20:21.420
How appropriate, I couldn't be happier.
Good work.

20:23.100 --> 20:26.300
I need you to wrangle me experts
on Tenofovir, PA-457,

20:26.460 --> 20:30.180
Viracept and Trimethadione. I also need
somebody here working on Paroxetine

20:30.260 --> 20:33.020
- and I need to speak to a hospital lawyer.
- Can I get you a coffee, too?

20:33.300 --> 20:35.940
No, you can get the cocktail
to Audrey for her 1st dosage

20:36.060 --> 20:38.580
and get me a meeting
with her son's pediatrician.

20:38.900 --> 20:40.620
Was that subtle sarcasm?

20:41.780 --> 20:42.660
No.

20:43.220 --> 20:44.460
Oh, too bad.

20:44.540 --> 20:46.980
Sarcasm would work well with
that bland exterior of yours.

21:08.940 --> 21:11.340
<i>- Yup.
- Hi, it's Mayko.</i>

21:16.460 --> 21:19.020
Uh... last year there were...

21:19.300 --> 21:21.380
542 students

21:21.500 --> 21:25.660
at Linderville Elementary,
and this year they've got 540.

21:27.580 --> 21:28.940
- Two lucky ones escaped.
- Well...

21:29.060 --> 21:32.100
actually 9 escaped and
7 new ones were captured, so...

21:32.220 --> 21:34.220
9 kids are out there and
no one is monitoring them.

21:36.660 --> 21:37.700
So?

21:38.540 --> 21:40.980
So the picture is incomplete.

21:42.980 --> 21:46.260
Okay. Well, 9 kids is
statistically irrelevant.

21:46.820 --> 21:49.180
Nothing is statistically irrelevant.

21:50.620 --> 21:51.540
Yeah.

21:52.340 --> 21:54.980
So what we should...
What we should do is we should...

22:13.740 --> 22:15.260
- Mayko Tran.
- Stop it, stop it.

22:15.340 --> 22:17.620
I don't want to stop.
You have a fantastic name.

22:17.980 --> 22:19.620
You want to know a secret?

22:20.460 --> 22:22.100
- It's not my real name.
- No way.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.260
No way.

22:23.380 --> 22:25.980
Well, Mayko is, but Tran, no.

22:26.540 --> 22:27.700
What is it?

22:28.620 --> 22:31.060
You won't think it's so fantastic.

22:31.220 --> 22:33.340
Shut up! Tell me, please, what is it?

22:37.100 --> 22:38.660
Binghamton.

22:40.220 --> 22:42.220
- Binghamton?
- It's not Vietnamese.

22:42.340 --> 22:45.020
- Well, I didn't think it was.
- Ha! Ha! Yeah.

22:45.780 --> 22:48.940
And Nora Taylor
and Wallace Binghamton

22:49.180 --> 22:52.100
adopted me and raised me
as an ethical atheist

22:52.220 --> 22:54.540
in  a hippie mountain town in B.C.

22:54.780 --> 22:58.420
My dad published the local paper,
mom was a potter.

22:59.100 --> 23:01.700
I changed it to Tran
when I turned 18,

23:02.260 --> 23:04.620
you know, mini identity crisis.

23:06.180 --> 23:08.180
- Want to know my middle name?
- Yes.

23:08.660 --> 23:10.140
- You swear to secrecy?
- Hmm.

23:10.460 --> 23:12.820
- You absolutely swear?
- I swear.

23:13.900 --> 23:14.900
Okay. Seabert.

23:15.540 --> 23:17.180
- Seabert?
- Yes.

23:17.660 --> 23:19.220
Ha! Ha!
- It's not as funny as Binghamton.

23:19.300 --> 23:22.060
- Oh, shush. Ha! Ha!
- I don't think.

23:22.140 --> 23:23.780
- It is pretty funny.
- Uh-uh.

23:35.660 --> 23:37.460
Meet patient zero.

23:37.620 --> 23:40.460
Both emails came from a computer
belonging to Afi Lundi.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.340
The girl in the photos.

23:42.700 --> 23:45.660
They came from her home computer
in Nampula, Mozambique.

23:45.820 --> 23:48.140
She was working as a nurse
there in an orphanage.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.420
I called, Sean was there
at the same time.

23:51.260 --> 23:53.820
I guess they had a thing,
just as you suspected.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.300
- Where is she now?
- She's dead.

23:56.940 --> 23:59.700
They gave her HIV drugs
at a clinic in Nampula.

23:59.900 --> 24:00.980
No effect.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.660
I read the medical report,
her HIV was an unknown strain,

24:03.820 --> 24:07.220
it progressed very rapidly to AIDS.
She was dead within a month.

24:13.100 --> 24:15.980
<i>There are many ways
I could have become sick.</i>

24:16.380 --> 24:18.060
<i>Perhaps I have a husband.</i>

24:18.700 --> 24:22.420
<i>Perhaps he laid with a prostitute
who could not afford condoms.</i>

24:22.500 --> 24:24.420
<i>He gave me to his friend
for the night</i>

24:24.740 --> 24:26.980
<i>in thanks for him helping to fix our hut.</i>

24:27.100 --> 24:29.620
<i>Or maybe it was the day I turned 12,</i>

24:29.820 --> 24:31.980
<i>while they performed the circumcision.</i>

24:32.500 --> 24:33.700
<i>They had used</i>

24:33.860 --> 24:36.420
<i>the same blade on the 10 girls before me.</i>

24:38.100 --> 24:40.340
<i>Have you forgotten what it is like?</i>

24:40.940 --> 24:44.740
<i>Stop thinking that you can save everyone.</i>

24:56.380 --> 24:57.860
<i>Lawyers cannot be allowed</i>

24:57.980 --> 25:00.300
<i>to dictate policy to us, all right?</i>

25:00.460 --> 25:02.820
<i>They know nothing about what we do.</i>

25:05.300 --> 25:07.140
- How's it going?
- I'm not sure.

25:07.180 --> 25:09.740
<i>Lawyers are risk-averse mice, all right.</i>

25:09.900 --> 25:12.980
<i>They answer to a law
that looks backwards, not forwards.</i>

25:13.580 --> 25:15.740
<i>Tough shit! Because that
little baby does have it,</i>

25:15.900 --> 25:18.620
<i>and he doesn't have time for you
to go back to your goddamn lab</i>

25:18.740 --> 25:22.100
<i>and spend years trying
to figure out the fucking dosage.</i>

25:25.220 --> 25:26.700
Side effects.

25:26.820 --> 25:28.700
Neurological pediatrics.
Can you fucking believe that?

25:28.820 --> 25:31.380
Liver dysfunction, FDA, Canada Health.

25:31.500 --> 25:34.660
Get those sleepwalking,
goddamn morons out of my lab right now.

25:34.820 --> 25:37.820
- You told me to put them there.
- Good news, David.

25:38.340 --> 25:39.940
The Paroxetine is working.

25:40.020 --> 25:42.540
It'll only work if we can use it, Bob.

25:44.220 --> 25:46.740
- How are you doing?
- Well, they could have been real scientists,

25:46.900 --> 25:48.860
but they copped out and became
doctors instead, or scientists who work

25:48.980 --> 25:51.380
for big drug companies
because they like security,

25:51.460 --> 25:54.420
so I'm not exactly running
with wolves here. You?

25:54.500 --> 25:57.700
Lawyers, they learn early that if they say yes,
it might come back and bite them in the ass,

25:57.780 --> 26:00.980
so for the rest of their lives,
all they say is no.

26:03.340 --> 26:04.900
Maybe you should switch.

26:05.340 --> 26:07.300
The medical guys think they're gods,

26:07.580 --> 26:09.620
they can't back down to a mere scientist.

26:09.780 --> 26:13.580
But they're used to listening to
administrators. David, you said so yourself.

26:13.780 --> 26:17.700
And lawyers aren't used
to a scientist who fights back.

26:25.780 --> 26:29.860
<i>Gentlemen, I cannot let a bunch
of doctors and scientists</i>

26:29.940 --> 26:33.260
<i>dictate social policy.
They are risk-adverse mice.</i>

26:33.940 --> 26:36.140
<i>Yeah, I remember her. Afi Lundi, sure.</i>

26:36.940 --> 26:39.340
She worked with AIDS
patients all over Africa.

26:39.580 --> 26:42.740
<i>Yeah, she was just in my clinic last year.
I was sad to lose her.</i>

26:43.900 --> 26:47.020
<i>She was always rocking the little ones
and singing them African lullabies.</i>

26:47.100 --> 26:49.420
<i>Ahem. You know, it's amazing
how a little love and attention</i>

26:49.540 --> 26:51.180
<i>lessens even the most unbearable suffering.</i>

26:53.700 --> 26:56.780
<i>She went to Mozambique
to start a programme for orphans.</i>

26:57.780 --> 27:00.300
<i>To help them gain self-sufficiency, but...</i>

27:00.780 --> 27:02.580
<i>I never heard from her again.</i>

27:02.740 --> 27:05.500
I think that she and Sean were lovers and...

27:05.740 --> 27:08.260
He got sick too. She died.

27:08.580 --> 27:10.300
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

27:11.860 --> 27:15.020
So this little girl in Nampula,
it was her blood that infected Afi.

27:15.180 --> 27:16.980
She's our new patient zero.

27:17.180 --> 27:19.220
She died 2 weeks before Afi.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.540
Have any new cases
surfaced in Mozambique?

27:26.700 --> 27:27.660
None.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.300
That they know of...

27:29.540 --> 27:32.380
This has been Africa's struggle
for many years.

27:32.540 --> 27:34.940
It's what Sean was trying
to make people understand.

27:35.740 --> 27:37.660
How are you doing
on the new HIV cocktail?

27:38.540 --> 27:40.260
It's not easy, Wes.

27:43.060 --> 27:44.980
It's a sick fucking disease.

27:49.060 --> 27:50.580
It must be hard for you

27:50.780 --> 27:53.180
to be on a cocktail the rest of your life.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.500
Believe me...

27:54.780 --> 27:56.020
It sucks.

27:56.340 --> 27:57.260
Yeah.

27:57.980 --> 28:00.180
And could you please forward
his report card to me?

28:00.940 --> 28:02.540
That's right, tran@NORBAC.ca.

28:02.740 --> 28:04.260
Okay, what was he diagnosed with?

28:04.340 --> 28:06.460
Do you mind me asking
why he's seeing a psychologist?

28:06.620 --> 28:08.300
...perfect recall of entire paragraphs.

28:08.460 --> 28:10.100
Yeah, I was curious
about your daughter Kara.

28:10.260 --> 28:12.100
She was in the study
in Linderville, and...

28:15.460 --> 28:17.300
Oh no, I didn't know.

28:20.060 --> 28:21.500
I'm sorry.

28:24.020 --> 28:26.100
Yes, what drugs did you study?

28:27.580 --> 28:29.500
Yes, Theophylline, Wafarine,

28:29.620 --> 28:31.060
Heparin, aminoglycosides.

28:31.140 --> 28:33.260
Doctor Lewinsky and Meyers
gave me some.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.620
They gave me some
individualized pharmacokinetic models

28:35.740 --> 28:37.860
to calculate the most appropriate dosages

28:37.900 --> 28:40.380
for everything from
nitroprusside to midazolam.

28:40.540 --> 28:43.460
Carlos Serrano. Ah, Dr. Preston.
Yes, thank you for returning my call...

28:43.660 --> 28:46.220
How effective have
the computer models been?

28:46.980 --> 28:49.220
<i>95% confidence level? Esta muy bien.</i>

28:49.700 --> 28:51.660
- That's fantastic.
- Hey.

28:52.180 --> 28:54.780
Okay, let me call you right back.
Thank you.

28:54.940 --> 28:56.940
It's going good with the lawyers,
how are you doing?

28:57.020 --> 28:59.620
Okay. I talked with Jennings at Harvard,
Davies, U.C.L.A.,

28:59.780 --> 29:02.660
5 other labs working on
computer-assisted dose determinants.

29:02.780 --> 29:04.260
- And?
- They figured out the dosage curve

29:04.380 --> 29:06.540
for every adult drug that
has an accepted preemie dose,

29:06.660 --> 29:09.340
averaged them all and
then designed a formula for predicting

29:09.460 --> 29:11.820
- preemie dosages in adult drugs. *
- You got a dosage ?

29:11.900 --> 29:13.260
I got a dosage.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.940
What if we wait a little while,
just... till he's stronger?

29:27.380 --> 29:30.260
Or test it out on me for a few days
before giving it to him?

29:30.940 --> 29:33.460
What you're saying makes perfect sense,

29:33.660 --> 29:36.940
except with this strain of HIV,
we have no time.

29:38.220 --> 29:40.740
What about the risks, the side effects?

29:41.340 --> 29:42.580
For him, not me.

29:43.260 --> 29:46.380
No risk or side effect
is as bad as what's heading his way.

29:46.740 --> 29:49.900
What about the dosage?
These are adult drugs.

29:51.020 --> 29:53.140
Well, I'm sorry.
You're not going to like this.

29:53.620 --> 29:55.900
The dose is a smart guess.
It hasn't been tested.

29:59.820 --> 30:01.340
We just have no time,

30:01.420 --> 30:03.300
but I think if we act now
there's a good chance

30:03.540 --> 30:05.140
he'll never progress to infection.

30:05.340 --> 30:08.140
So I should just throw the dice
with my son's life?

30:08.940 --> 30:12.060
We make no promises,
but there's no alternative, Audrey.

30:12.460 --> 30:13.580
None.

30:15.580 --> 30:18.500
We would like to give
him his 1st dose today.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.860
He'll be monitored constantly.

30:22.060 --> 30:25.380
The doctors will adjust the dose
over and over till they have it right.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.300
In 6 months he could be HIV-free.

30:27.460 --> 30:29.780
And never have to take the drugs again.

32:00.820 --> 32:02.980
<i>It wasn't prions,
it was the accident, David.</i>

32:03.700 --> 32:06.500
Well, you know, maybe
that's... maybe that's good news.

32:06.580 --> 32:08.300
A dead little girl, yeah.
I'm thrilled.

32:08.420 --> 32:10.500
Did she have a previously
registered I.Q. increase?

32:10.580 --> 32:11.540
Yeah.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.580
Well, that's good.
Exhume the body.

32:14.780 --> 32:17.300
Well, her parents, they refused.

32:17.580 --> 32:20.700
What? No. You've got
to exhume that body,

32:20.820 --> 32:23.380
we need a sample of the brain tissue
to see if there's plaque.

32:23.540 --> 32:26.340
I know, which is why
we're on our way to Pittsburgh.

32:26.780 --> 32:28.260
Okay, bye.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.380
We've consulted our Church,

32:31.060 --> 32:33.820
we've prayed
for God's guidance and...

32:35.300 --> 32:37.420
We're afraid that the answer is

32:37.900 --> 32:40.700
we cannot allow Kara's body
to be autopsied.

32:43.060 --> 32:44.820
What we could learn from her

32:44.940 --> 32:47.500
could help us help
all the other kids back in Linderville.

32:47.780 --> 32:50.700
Do you know
what it's like to lose a child?

32:51.020 --> 32:52.700
Your only child?

32:54.340 --> 32:56.260
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

33:00.300 --> 33:02.020
I know if
I lost my son,

33:04.420 --> 33:06.420
I would hardly be able to breathe.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.140
I can't imagine your pain.

33:10.660 --> 33:13.140
- I have a boy.
- How old is he?

33:15.420 --> 33:17.300
Andrew is 7.

33:18.660 --> 33:20.420
It's the same age as Kara.

33:24.820 --> 33:26.340
He looks like you.

33:26.860 --> 33:29.620
Yeah, he has
my personality too, unfortunately.

33:34.300 --> 33:36.660
I know if I lost Andrew, I would...

33:37.020 --> 33:38.700
I'd try and make some good

33:38.860 --> 33:40.180
out of it...

33:40.700 --> 33:42.460
You know, find some greater purpose.

33:44.060 --> 33:47.820
What if the greater purpose
for Kara was to help others?

33:48.660 --> 33:50.620
What if she was a gift from God

33:50.820 --> 33:52.900
to all those other parents in Linderville,

33:54.540 --> 33:56.500
and her death had a reason

33:57.100 --> 33:58.540
just like her life did?

34:03.380 --> 34:05.620
I think if you pray on this a little more,

34:06.740 --> 34:09.179
you'll find that this could
mean the gift of life

34:09.540 --> 34:11.139
for so many others

34:13.219 --> 34:15.300
and a consolation to you

34:16.340 --> 34:18.139
for your terrible loss.

34:31.980 --> 34:33.060
Thanks.

34:35.260 --> 34:36.820
I cannot believe you just did that.

34:36.940 --> 34:39.100
It's like you spoke
their language fluently.

34:39.260 --> 34:42.179
Well, my father was a good Protestant,
he never missed a service.

34:42.219 --> 34:44.060
God, you are full of surprises.

34:44.179 --> 34:47.580
- I had no idea you had a son.
- Andrew is the love of my life.

34:48.300 --> 34:49.940
It must be hard being
away from him.

34:50.020 --> 34:53.139
It's awful, yeah, but...
he has a fine mum.

34:53.860 --> 34:55.739
So how long have you been divorced?

34:58.300 --> 34:59.700
You're not divorced.

35:00.460 --> 35:01.340
No.

35:02.780 --> 35:03.940
Separated?

35:05.460 --> 35:06.540
No.

35:26.620 --> 35:28.260
Well, what are the options?

35:29.580 --> 35:31.500
No, that's not an option.

35:32.540 --> 35:36.420
I don't know, just give Glen
whatever he needs to take away his pain.

35:37.460 --> 35:39.540
No, I don't know that
and you don't know that,

35:39.700 --> 35:42.380
but let's just assume
he has pain and do something!

35:45.220 --> 35:46.300
All right.

35:47.100 --> 35:49.140
All right. Thanks, doctor.

36:13.860 --> 36:16.180
Oh Bob! What are you doing here?

36:17.180 --> 36:18.300
I work here.

36:19.060 --> 36:20.700
- You were crying.
- I know.

36:21.260 --> 36:22.460
Bob, it's nothing.

36:22.620 --> 36:24.820
I don't understand,
the baby results are good.

36:24.940 --> 36:27.780
- That's happy news.
- I know, Bob. It's just...

36:28.700 --> 36:32.220
You know, sometimes people,
for different reasons, they...

36:33.020 --> 36:33.940
Oh.

36:34.940 --> 36:36.180
Caroline, you know, yesterday,

36:36.340 --> 36:38.660
when you were at the chronic care
facility next to pharmacy

36:38.780 --> 36:40.580
and didn't know
that I saw you, but I did?

36:41.940 --> 36:43.660
Bob, I really need to get inside.

36:43.820 --> 36:45.860
It was really strange to see you
somewhere other than here, because

36:45.940 --> 36:47.700
when you're here
you're always serious,

36:47.780 --> 36:50.500
and when you're not here
you're... different.

36:50.620 --> 36:52.980
Bob, I really don't want
to talk about this.

36:53.100 --> 36:54.340
Oh, I'm sorry.

36:54.420 --> 36:55.980
Can I ask you one question?

36:57.580 --> 36:58.820
What question?

37:01.460 --> 37:04.020
Were you visiting
someone at the chronic care facility?

37:04.500 --> 37:06.060
My nephew, Glen.

37:06.540 --> 37:07.780
Why? How?

37:08.460 --> 37:10.100
Well he ran every day training

37:10.180 --> 37:12.340
for the Rhode Island
High School track finals

37:12.740 --> 37:15.940
And the one morning
a couple of years ago he just...

37:16.700 --> 37:17.780
fell.

37:17.900 --> 37:20.180
He had a stroke.
Never woke up again.

37:20.580 --> 37:23.020
He had a stroke? He's so young.

37:24.140 --> 37:27.900
My sister Meg quit her job
and stayed with him practically 24/7

37:28.380 --> 37:30.420
at a Boston care facility...

37:30.620 --> 37:32.780
- until she died.
- Of what?

37:34.180 --> 37:35.420
Cancer.

37:36.220 --> 37:37.580
Breast cancer.

37:39.940 --> 37:42.420
When Meg was dying, a year ago now,

37:42.580 --> 37:45.660
she asked me to become his legal guardian.

37:46.580 --> 37:47.780
That's lucky for you.

37:50.460 --> 37:51.340
Right.

37:51.740 --> 37:55.340
So, I arranged for him
to come to Toronto

37:55.780 --> 37:57.180
to be closer.

37:58.420 --> 38:01.580
- How often do you visit?
- Three times a week...

38:01.820 --> 38:03.940
And sometimes two...

38:04.340 --> 38:07.380
And sometimes one, which is not enough.

38:07.660 --> 38:08.580
Well...

38:10.940 --> 38:12.260
...would you mind if I did?

38:12.860 --> 38:13.780
What?

38:14.500 --> 38:15.940
Visit him too.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.980
No. I wouldn't mind.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.420
Mayko, come on, don't... Look...

38:34.780 --> 38:37.100
I mean, just stab me 50 times
with the garden shears,

38:37.220 --> 38:39.020
just don't do the silent treatment.

38:40.180 --> 38:42.740
God, I had sex with a married man.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.340
What? Well...

38:46.140 --> 38:47.860
Oh, bloody hell.

38:48.020 --> 38:50.060
No, look, Nicole and I...

38:50.780 --> 38:53.700
we understand, okay, that love

38:53.940 --> 38:56.660
and lust and the desire
for long-term relationships

38:56.780 --> 38:58.700
all occur in separate
regions of the brain.

38:59.100 --> 39:02.460
So listen, we've got all 3
working their arses off for each other,

39:02.580 --> 39:04.140
but over here on the left,

39:04.340 --> 39:07.860
this biochemical activity... lust,

39:08.500 --> 39:10.620
sometimes just kicks off

39:10.820 --> 39:12.180
for other people and
there's nothing you can...

39:12.260 --> 39:14.100
you can't just switch it
off on command.

39:14.660 --> 39:17.500
So, you know,
rather than mute our lust,

39:17.540 --> 39:19.300
we explore it.

39:22.620 --> 39:25.540
I did not deceive Nicole
by enjoying an evening with you.

39:26.060 --> 39:28.140
No, you deceived me.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.780
I'm sorry, I didn't... I mean...

39:34.020 --> 39:37.300
In London, in the circles I travel,
people are just open-minded.

39:38.340 --> 39:40.420
Well, I'm an ethical atheist, remember?

39:40.580 --> 39:42.260
My mind leads, not my hormones,

39:42.340 --> 39:45.060
I expect no less
from the man I'm with.

39:48.460 --> 39:50.500
Mayko, I'm sorry, okay? But you know,

39:50.740 --> 39:52.940
if it was that important to you,
you should have asked.

39:53.300 --> 39:55.940
Well, if I was that important to you
I wouldn't have had to.

40:27.940 --> 40:30.460
Hey, why the long faces?

40:32.100 --> 40:34.500
Brain tissue from the dead girl.

40:40.300 --> 40:42.940
Ah, shit. Plaque.

40:43.180 --> 40:45.300
- Classic case of prion disease.
- Right.

40:45.420 --> 40:46.980
If the swimming pool hadn't done her in

40:47.100 --> 40:49.100
little Kara would have been dead
in a few years anyway.

40:50.860 --> 40:54.420
Okay, so the I.Q. increases
predict the disease.

40:54.540 --> 40:56.340
Oh, hey, not necessarily.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.500
- There's just one case, eh? One child.
- Right, nothing's certain.

41:00.020 --> 41:01.500
Yeah, but it's not good.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.580
Well, we can't jump to conclusions here.

41:03.700 --> 41:05.860
This is one finding, Mayko.
It could be an anomaly.

41:05.940 --> 41:08.060
One point of light doesn't
make a line, right?

41:09.980 --> 41:11.980
Okay. Well, thanks, guys.

41:22.460 --> 41:23.980
How is he?

41:25.020 --> 41:28.860
Did you notice that
Richard has 10 fingers and 10 toes?

41:30.740 --> 41:32.820
I love his little fingernails,

41:33.460 --> 41:34.820
they're like paper.

41:37.100 --> 41:38.180
He looks good.

41:41.460 --> 41:42.740
We won't know for certain

41:42.900 --> 41:45.420
for about 6 months if he's HIV negative...

41:45.900 --> 41:47.260
But it looks good.

41:49.260 --> 41:51.660
Soon you'll be able to take him home, and

41:52.100 --> 41:53.740
get on with your life.

41:55.820 --> 41:57.980
I'm just starting to let myself think about...

41:58.780 --> 42:00.620
stupid things,

42:01.900 --> 42:06.060
like is he gonna love
crossword puzzles like I do?

42:06.220 --> 42:08.820
Is he gonna hate strained peas?

42:10.380 --> 42:13.260
- I know don't, maybe I shouldn't...
- Of course you should.

42:13.940 --> 42:15.820
You should think about the future.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.420
Now Richard has one.

42:22.860 --> 42:25.180
We found a cocktail,
I'm sending it to you.

42:26.140 --> 42:27.260
<i>What am I gonna do with it?</i>

42:27.580 --> 42:29.540
I know you have
connections in South Africa,

42:29.700 --> 42:33.300
you can have the drug reverse-engineered
and shipped to clinics in Mozambique.

42:34.020 --> 42:35.580
<i>No such thing as proper channels?</i>

42:36.420 --> 42:38.540
Come on Jack,
you know that would take too long.

42:38.900 --> 42:41.180
By the time it would get
to Mozambique, more of this strain

42:41.300 --> 42:42.780
could surface and stumble out of control

42:42.860 --> 42:45.020
but if you do it,
you can get it there pronto.

42:46.180 --> 42:49.220
<i>Tell me, Carlos. When am I
getting back my favourite doctor?</i>

42:52.020 --> 42:54.700
You know, I yearn to go back
to Africa, Jack, I really do.

42:54.980 --> 42:57.420
I love the people
and I want to help them,

42:58.380 --> 43:01.860
but I made a bigger impact
on HIV the last few days at NORBAC

43:01.980 --> 43:03.740
than I did 18 months in Africa.

43:04.940 --> 43:06.860
This is where I'm meant to be.

43:07.460 --> 43:08.500
<i>Okay.</i>

43:09.340 --> 43:10.740
Goodbye, my friend.

43:11.620 --> 43:12.540
<i>Bye.</i>

43:13.620 --> 43:15.460
<i>Ruby McGhee. I'm 7 years,</i>

43:15.500 --> 43:17.820
<i>11 months and 12 days old.</i>

43:18.020 --> 43:19.900
<i>- Your birthday's coming up.
- Yup.</i>

43:19.980 --> 43:23.460
<i>- You having a party?
- Two: one for my granny and cousins</i>

43:23.700 --> 43:26.220
<i>and one for all my friends at school.</i>

43:27.380 --> 43:29.860
<i>When I turn 9, I'm getting...</i>

43:30.060 --> 43:31.420
<i>I'm having a sleepover,</i>

43:31.540 --> 43:34.420
<i>and when I turn 16,
I'm getting a Porsche Boxter.</i>

43:35.500 --> 43:38.420
<i>- Sounds you got big plans, Ruby.
- Yup.</i>

44:10.620 --> 44:12.180
Bob, meet Glen.

44:13.380 --> 44:14.500
Hi, Glen.

44:45.860 --> 44:47.580
<i>Next time on ReGenesis:</i>

44:47.660 --> 44:50.020
We have 3 hours before the conference.
That should give us enough time.

44:50.020 --> 44:51.780
- Eat your breakfast.
- Hey! Come on, Bob.

44:59.500 --> 45:01.900
You really think
it's safe to be down here?

45:02.060 --> 45:03.500
What do you want, then?

45:03.700 --> 45:05.500
A couple weeks ago,
she started feeling bad,

45:05.620 --> 45:08.940
and then she started getting
dizzy and she lost her appetite.

45:09.180 --> 45:11.420
She needs to see a fucking doctor, okay?

45:11.580 --> 45:14.780
We're talking about
a cure for juvenile diabetes.

45:14.940 --> 45:16.500
Oh, my God!

45:16.860 --> 45:18.380
Should he deteriorate further,
would you like us

45:18.460 --> 45:20.220
to take measures to sustain his life?

45:20.380 --> 45:22.540
Why do you people keep asking me that?

45:22.780 --> 45:24.940
I'm sorry. You do understand

45:25.060 --> 45:28.180
that what we're doing is not helping Glen,
it's just keeping him alive.

45:28.980 --> 45:30.620
I understand.

45:31.740 --> 45:35.500
We've intercepted messages from hackers
trying to crack NORBAC's website.

45:35.660 --> 45:37.780
If you would rather work
with us than against us,

45:37.820 --> 45:41.020
become a NORBAC field agent
and receive a new mission each week.

45:41.180 --> 45:43.460
Remember, only you know
the whole story.
