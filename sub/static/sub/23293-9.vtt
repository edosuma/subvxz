00:13.400 --> 00:16.040
SUNDAY
03:15 PM

00:59.480 --> 01:01.720
53 HOURS OF ROBBERY

02:09.160 --> 02:13.400
"Known for perpetrating numerous robberies
at jeweller’s and luxury shops,

02:13.480 --> 02:17.560
Andrés de Fonollosa is also responsible
for other sexual offences."

02:17.640 --> 02:19.480
What a curriculum!

02:20.360 --> 02:22.200
Andrés de Fonollosa.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.480
Who would have thought?

02:24.960 --> 02:26.800
Such a refinement

02:27.800 --> 02:30.120
and that stick you seem
to have stuck up your bottom.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.640
In the end, it turns out to be
that you like whores.

02:33.720 --> 02:37.040
"In particular, being part
of a ring of women trafficking

02:37.200 --> 02:39.400
brought in from eastern Europe,
from Albania and Bulgaria,

02:39.760 --> 02:41.440
to be sold later..."

02:41.520 --> 02:45.880
Did you also taste the Bulgarian women,
eh, before selling them?

02:45.960 --> 02:49.040
"Procuring, extortion of minors,

02:49.120 --> 02:50.760
-deprivation of liberty..."
-Minors?

02:50.840 --> 02:53.160
-..."as well as the previously mentioned."
-Minors?

02:53.320 --> 02:54.720
-..."arm robbery."
-Minors.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.240
"Amongst them, the attempted robbery
of a well-known jeweller’s shop

02:57.320 --> 02:58.240
in Vendôme square."

02:58.440 --> 02:59.920
You’re a pig.

03:00.400 --> 03:04.000
Can you tell me
why that girl is in your office, tied up?

03:06.040 --> 03:09.240
What are going to do with her,
piece of scum?

03:09.360 --> 03:12.280
"According to the latest news,
Fonollosa has eluded

03:12.360 --> 03:15.440
this last charge thanks
to his cooperation as an informant."

03:15.600 --> 03:19.080
Ah, and a snitch, too...

03:19.160 --> 03:21.920
"...identified by the police
together with Silene Oliveira..."

03:30.680 --> 03:34.440
I would never sell women.
And much less I would be a pimp.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.400
My ethics code doesn’t let me do it.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.920
The same way it stops me
from telling on a colleague,

03:39.000 --> 03:40.360
despite being such a human waste.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.840
And that’s nothing to do
with my tastes and my likings, Nairobi.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.040
If you say so.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.320
-"...the robbers’ spokesperson.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.280
A fingerprint from Andrés de Fonollosa
has been found

04:02.360 --> 04:07.000
on a button that the officers found in
a Seat Ibiza linked to the investigation.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.960
-Specialized police units..."
-I’ve never been inside that car.

04:12.040 --> 04:16.040
"...in search for new traces of DNA
that can provide some clues..."

04:16.400 --> 04:18.320
But I know who did.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.480
What’s the matter?

04:54.440 --> 04:57.040
What the fuck are you doing
with my jacket, piece of crap?

04:57.120 --> 04:58.440
Fuck you, son of a bitch.

05:00.680 --> 05:01.840
Fucking hell.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.400
Tell me, Nairobi,
do you know where Denver is?

05:06.800 --> 05:07.720
No.

06:24.120 --> 06:27.040
A bit calmed and slow, aren’t we?
Is it still like this?

06:29.080 --> 06:29.960
Shall I help you?

06:31.120 --> 06:33.880
The sooner we finish the whole,
the sooner will get out of here.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.920
Are you tired of being here?

06:40.960 --> 06:41.840
Well.

06:45.520 --> 06:49.760
-This can bore anyone.
-You’re bored with 67 hostages,

06:50.640 --> 06:56.120
firing your M-16 and the cops
outside the door. Is that why?

06:59.360 --> 07:01.760
Is that why you tried to bite
that poor lamb’s neck?

07:02.400 --> 07:05.040
And you started kissing her,
while she was scared to death.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.200
What the heck was that for?

07:09.080 --> 07:10.440
To provoke you.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.920
You are awfully quiet
when you go for a shit.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.040
And what now?

07:21.560 --> 07:23.160
Are you getting bored of Rio?

07:28.680 --> 07:31.680
-Why do you say that?
-Because you’re that kind of person.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.120
Am I?

07:36.720 --> 07:37.920
What kind of person?

07:42.720 --> 07:44.680
Of those, one does not want for their son.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.560
Do you remember what happened in Toledo,
the day we had paella?

07:48.720 --> 07:52.360
It was the night of San Juan and you went
to the street party with no permission.

07:53.720 --> 07:54.600
Yes.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.200
What is it?

08:10.280 --> 08:11.400
-What’s wrong?
-Say.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.200
What?

08:27.720 --> 08:31.800
Did you know that there are over
2,000 trillion stars in the sky?

08:33.920 --> 08:36.160
-So, you have counted them all?
-Of course, man.

08:43.480 --> 08:47.040
I need some more fun, here.

08:47.400 --> 08:51.440
And I know, Tokyo, I know you keep
something similar to this in your room.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.440
-Some.
-Yes. We might as well?

08:54.520 --> 08:59.480
-Whoa, Rio! Whoa, Rio! Poor...
-Rio, he was ever so drunk.

08:59.560 --> 09:00.800
-Very drunk.
-How dru...

09:14.680 --> 09:15.960
Will you give me a puff?

09:21.000 --> 09:21.880
Listen.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.920
Why did you tell me that
about the stars earlier on?

09:28.560 --> 09:30.880
I don’t really know, mate,
because it’s a nice thing.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.320
All the stars up there, like...
I don’t know.

09:33.800 --> 09:37.000
There, in the mountains. I don’t really
know why I told you that, mate.

09:37.720 --> 09:38.680
Nothing else?

09:40.880 --> 09:43.560
-Nothing else about what?
-I don't know.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.160
That you might mean something else, no?

09:48.120 --> 09:51.440
Something like if you want to fuck with me
or something of that sort?

09:53.760 --> 09:56.680
But... would you like to?

09:57.320 --> 09:59.640
-Come off, mate.
-What? Piss off!

09:59.720 --> 10:01.120
Piss off!

10:01.560 --> 10:02.440
Dad...

10:03.560 --> 10:05.200
Dad, what are you doing, standing there?

10:05.280 --> 10:08.640
No, nothing. Nothing,
I was there and you weren’t...

10:09.800 --> 10:11.920
Where have you been
at this time and like that?

10:12.080 --> 10:13.040
Shush.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.400
-We are back from the street party.
-Oh, my.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.760
-The street party.
-So you went out from here...

10:19.920 --> 10:22.160
-We never went to the street party!
-Don’t lie.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.640
We stayed in drinking. Off to bed.

10:24.800 --> 10:25.680
I can’t sleep now.

10:26.080 --> 10:29.160
I can’t sleep,
so I’m going to have a drink, okay?

10:29.960 --> 10:32.040
Dad, you nod off quickly.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.480
Dad, look at me, look at me. Off to bed.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.800
Go to bed. Listen to me.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.840
-Have you got at ciggie?
-For fuck’s sake!

10:39.920 --> 10:42.040
-Sure. Here you are, have a smoke.
-Might as well.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.480
-Have this one.
-Come on.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.600
I’m going to the toilet. But, when
I’m back, everyone, to their room.

10:46.680 --> 10:47.600
Come on.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.280
-See if you can have some sleep.
-See you later, dear.

10:50.440 --> 10:51.840
You!

10:52.160 --> 10:56.000
Couldn’t you see what I was doing
with my eyes so you would leave?

10:56.080 --> 10:56.800
Why?

10:57.040 --> 10:59.280
You spoiled all the fun, dad.
Fucking shit...

11:00.160 --> 11:04.040
-Eh... Tokyo and you...?
-Yes, there. There.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.000
-Yes, she’s hot.
-Hot?

11:06.080 --> 11:08.200
She’s gorgeous, dada. She’s gorgeous.

11:08.280 --> 11:11.520
But there’ll be plenty of time.
Now you have to focus.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.720
Focus? I haven’t been more focused
in all my life.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.360
What you have to focus on.
Let’s go to bed.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.480
Fuck me. I’ m not going to sleep
in the same bed with you

11:19.560 --> 11:21.600
after almost going to sleep
with that goddess.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.640
I’ll sleep in the fucking car.

11:23.720 --> 11:26.200
-No way you’re sleeping in the car?
-Shut up.

11:26.840 --> 11:29.520
You always do the same thing, damn,
you’re always doing that.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.880
And what’s wrong,
I’m not enough for your son?

11:44.240 --> 11:45.680
I think you’re too much.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.600
Because you live your life
like a videogame.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.000
Robberies, shooting, lovers.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.280
Adventures...

11:57.120 --> 11:59.040
-Well, yes, I enjoy life.
-No.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.080
You enjoy leaping from one stone
onto another in mud pools.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.040
And after you leap, the stone sinks in.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.720
You leave dead bodies behind
on the hard shoulders.

12:10.320 --> 12:11.760
That’s what you like.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.600
Whose idea was it to rob the security van?
Yours or your boyfriend’s?

12:22.000 --> 12:22.960
Yours, wasn’t it?

12:24.680 --> 12:26.480
So now your boyfriend is a dead man.

12:28.360 --> 12:29.520
And so is your mother.

12:29.960 --> 12:33.600
I’m sure that you were aware of how much
harm you were doing to your mother.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.560
And now it’s Rio’s turn.

12:38.280 --> 12:39.440
You’re already bored.

12:41.080 --> 12:44.560
On top of that, you touch a young girl up
while holding her at gunpoint.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.040
So irresponsible.

12:48.320 --> 12:50.840
Fickle, superficial, selfish.

12:52.600 --> 12:53.760
How do you define yourself?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.960
If we all do our job and it goes badly,

13:02.080 --> 13:03.520
it’s part of the job.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.640
But if it goes bad because a fickle brat

13:08.280 --> 13:11.000
wants to leave urgently, I won’t allow it.

13:11.920 --> 13:14.720
So, start working.
We’ve only got 10 days left.

13:16.160 --> 13:19.120
See if once in your life you fucking
finish what you have started.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.880
I dozed off, damn it.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.040
-Yes, I was about to wake you up.
-Have I been sleeping long?

13:45.880 --> 13:46.760
I don’t know.

13:48.760 --> 13:52.640
The first time I sleep with a girl
and when I wake up, she’s still there.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.200
I don’t know where you expected me to go.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.040
I don’t know where you expected me to go.

13:57.120 --> 14:00.600
Inside a whole with a shot wound in my leg
and amid a kidnapping.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.600
-I don’t have many options, do I?
-What’s wrong?

14:04.480 --> 14:06.640
You needn’t be so rough,
I saved your life.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.120
You saved my life?

14:08.200 --> 14:09.680
-Yes.
-How did you save my life?

14:09.760 --> 14:12.080
How? Like the Jews in Auschwitz?

14:12.160 --> 14:15.560
When a Nazi pulled them off the queue
and they didn’t go to the gas chamber.

14:15.640 --> 14:18.160
I’m not a fucking Nazi, huh?
I’m not a fucking Nazi.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.280
I remind you
that you stole a mobile phone,

14:20.360 --> 14:22.920
-and I was ordered to kill you.
-And what did you do?

14:23.080 --> 14:24.400
Hey, what did you do?

14:24.480 --> 14:26.800
You said no, you stopped him? No.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.760
You shot me in the leg.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.120
You humiliated me before everyone.

14:31.560 --> 14:34.960
And now you have locked me up here,
I can’t breathe or go to the toilet.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.680
I go where, in a bucket?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.160
So, don't make a mistake.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.960
You may be the best out of all the Nazis,
but you still are not one of them.

14:50.000 --> 14:50.880
I’m sorry.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.760
I’m sorry, I wasn’t...

14:54.560 --> 14:56.040
It wasn’t my intention to humiliate you.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.080
I don’t quite know what to do...
about all this.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.560
I’m going to take you the toilet, okay?
Do you agree?

15:07.960 --> 15:08.840
Okay.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.320
Then, let’s go.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.640
Denver!

16:56.960 --> 16:58.160
My friend!

16:59.200 --> 17:00.440
Come here!

17:02.360 --> 17:03.360
Damn it!

17:03.800 --> 17:05.120
Berlin, wait!

17:06.360 --> 17:07.720
Berlin, stop!

17:08.320 --> 17:09.920
Wait, damn it, Berlin!

17:10.560 --> 17:13.680
Listen to me, stop, stop, stop, stop.
You’re right!

17:14.520 --> 17:15.680
You’re right.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.840
Denver might have lost
the button of your jacket

17:19.920 --> 17:22.400
because he put on your jacket,
but, so what?

17:22.480 --> 17:25.480
-You can’t change that.
-But I can punish him.

17:27.080 --> 17:27.960
Berlin.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.960
He’s not resting. He’s not at the museum

17:34.120 --> 17:35.160
or the tunnel.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.360
Or the printing house.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.200
He’s probably gone
to the street party again?

17:41.320 --> 17:43.200
Relax, guys, I’ll look for him.

17:43.880 --> 17:47.280
Berlin, please, come to your senses.
Come to your senses, huh?

17:47.360 --> 17:50.280
You can’t shoot him
because he stole your jacket.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.480
It’s a blotched job. You’re a bloke
with style and that’s a blotched job.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.320
What about my dignity?

17:58.880 --> 18:01.000
I have a reputation to keep.

18:02.320 --> 18:06.920
My friends from the Costa Azul have seen
my name connected to those lies.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.640
Denver has screwed my honour.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.520
And if someone screws my honour,
I’ll destroy him.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.400
Do you understand?
We’re talking about integrity here.

18:21.440 --> 18:26.080
Ethics... is important, Nairobi.
But... aesthetics, too.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.840
I beg you, please.

18:29.320 --> 18:32.840
Please, don’t screw the plan up for us,
Berlin.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.080
-You fucking scum...
-Eh, eh, eh. Back off.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.000
Nairobi.

18:42.760 --> 18:44.520
-Stay here.
-Helsinki.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.920
What’ll you do, will you shoot me?

18:51.080 --> 18:52.880
Stay... here.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.080
It was a fucking joke
the whole jacket thing.

18:56.160 --> 18:59.200
It was a fucking joke
the whole jacket thing!

19:01.200 --> 19:02.480
It was a joke!

19:05.200 --> 19:08.120
I don’t know if I’m overdoing it
a little with the lipstick.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.800
I might look a bit like a whore.
What do you think?

19:10.880 --> 19:15.040
-On the contrary, I have a simple look.
-That’s why I’m saying it...

19:15.480 --> 19:18.000
-Let’s see, where are we heading?
-For the street party.

19:18.520 --> 19:21.840
So, you need to look like
a street... slut.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.040
-What is it?
-We’re partying.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.400
Shush.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.600
-The Professor’s keys?
-I got them.

19:28.680 --> 19:29.880
Oh, the car...

19:32.160 --> 19:33.360
Fuck!

19:37.560 --> 19:38.520
Done.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.840
-Where is Denver?
-No idea.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.360
What do you mean, no idea?

19:42.440 --> 19:45.080
Yes, now we can.

19:45.760 --> 19:46.880
Quiet.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.360
-But, and this?
-This is pure elegance.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.280
-Berlin’s jacket?
-Yes, that’s right.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.160
-He’ll kill you.
-No, he won’t.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.680
Off we go, off we go.

19:57.400 --> 20:01.000
Silence, silence, silence.
Silence, it’s coming... it’s coming to me.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.560
-Shush.
-What are you on about?

20:04.320 --> 20:06.600
Have I ever told you about my five wives?

20:10.880 --> 20:13.080
They just want us to impregnate them,
but later...

20:13.400 --> 20:14.840
what comes out of there...

20:15.760 --> 20:18.560
is a nuclear warhead.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.600
Stop it, you make me feel nervous!

20:28.680 --> 20:29.840
You look beautiful.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.440
-I chose an anime look for you.
-I like anime.

20:58.920 --> 20:59.920
What’s the matter?

21:01.160 --> 21:02.040
Have you been crying.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.320
Who do you think I am?

21:06.480 --> 21:07.440
The fucking best woman.

21:10.120 --> 21:12.640
I think I am a fickle person
who fucks everyone up.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.240
It’s like I could see myself in a film,
and I didn’t...

21:16.920 --> 21:18.200
recognize myself.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.080
Because I thought I was...

21:23.160 --> 21:24.160
different,

21:25.760 --> 21:28.200
but in fact I’m a fucking mad woman
who causes pain,

21:29.720 --> 21:30.920
and gets bored of everything.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.440
And who doesn’t make people happy.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.600
And I don’t like the way I am,

21:44.680 --> 21:48.440
nor this fucking book that I saw here
in the CEO’s office.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.640
It says I’m a toxic woman.

21:54.280 --> 21:58.120
If you’re trying to break up with me,
make me go away or something of that sort,

21:59.160 --> 22:00.360
don’t you dare.

22:03.480 --> 22:04.560
Rio, mate...

22:07.800 --> 22:09.040
I’m burnt soil.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.120
Worse.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.600
I’m a fucking petrol drum and a match.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.200
I love bonfires.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.200
And if you’re toxic, I’ll feel dizzy.

22:22.120 --> 22:24.440
With a joint, and I’ll enjoy it.

22:25.840 --> 22:26.720
Look here.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.600
When I see you
at the other side of the museum,

22:32.160 --> 22:33.440
it makes me feel like crying...

22:34.800 --> 22:36.600
just for being with you.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.920
And we fuck
and I’m floating around the room.

22:50.320 --> 22:51.840
I know you will leave me.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.200
But why don’t we cope with each other
a little longer?

22:56.480 --> 22:57.760
Does it have to be now?

23:03.880 --> 23:05.520
No, it doesn’t have to be now.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.080
Start recording.

24:04.080 --> 24:05.800
-And this hair.
-Perfect.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.360
Z-75, to all units.

24:21.440 --> 24:24.840
There is an arm robbery on Alcántara, 33.
It’s a ironmonger’s.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.360
Any unit nearby?

24:26.440 --> 24:29.600
Unit Z-32, we are just in front
of the door, we’re heading there.

24:38.680 --> 24:39.560
It’s him.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.720
Yes. I’m sure.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.800
Why doesn’t he pick up, where is he?

25:00.160 --> 25:04.240
I’m in front of Karina's school,
your daughter.

25:06.320 --> 25:09.200
"And people from my organization
are in Krostoma,

25:09.680 --> 25:14.560
watching your wife
coming out of the supermarket."

25:15.040 --> 25:18.560
If the identikit you are doing

25:18.840 --> 25:20.760
"looks like me,

25:21.080 --> 25:25.640
you won’t ever see neither of them."

25:25.720 --> 25:27.840
Who the hell is on channel 8?

25:27.920 --> 25:32.200
"The police cannot protect you, Nikolai."

25:34.640 --> 25:36.920
Let go of that, let go of that! Let go!

25:37.680 --> 25:39.240
-Fuck!
-Let go of that!

25:39.560 --> 25:42.960
God! What the heck did he say?
What the heck did he say?

25:43.400 --> 25:44.200
I didn’t hear anything.

25:45.360 --> 25:46.640
What did he tell you?

25:47.600 --> 25:50.840
H-50. Control room. Where was
that message in Russian sent from?

25:51.440 --> 25:53.480
"From a Z, Z-32."

25:55.880 --> 25:57.880
Z-32, do you read me?

25:57.960 --> 26:01.640
"This is Z-32 exiting the ironmonger’s.
It was a false robbery call."

26:01.720 --> 26:04.680
Someone is in your car.
Run to the patrol car.

26:08.320 --> 26:11.240
Control room, indeed,
they went in, but there’s no one now.

26:11.320 --> 26:14.560
He must be near.
Look for someone, a suspect.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.680
Male, 40 years old, has a beard.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.320
"There’s no one nearby. We start to move."

26:28.320 --> 26:29.680
Denver!

26:33.280 --> 26:34.360
Denver?

26:37.760 --> 26:38.800
Denver.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.320
-I was looking for you.
-Here I am.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.280
The thing is...

26:51.000 --> 26:53.760
my face is constantly
in the TV news report.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.760
Do you know what they say about me?

26:57.440 --> 26:59.440
-No.
-That I’m thief.

27:01.680 --> 27:05.360
That I can understand,
but they all say I like prostitutes,

27:06.040 --> 27:11.040
I am a procurer, I abuse kids.
And all that because of a button.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.040
A button from my jacket.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.720
Remember? The one you put on.

27:17.920 --> 27:21.400
And apparently you left it behind
inside the car we had in Toledo.

27:21.480 --> 27:24.200
A car that, by the way,
I, I’m sure, wasn’t...

27:25.480 --> 27:26.720
I was never in.

27:27.720 --> 27:29.320
Do you know what that means?

27:29.760 --> 27:30.640
I don’t know.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.320
-You do know.
-I don’t know.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.280
You have just fucked my life.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.240
Come off.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.640
-What should I do with you?
-Berlin.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.920
I’m sorry, mate,
I didn’t see the fucking button.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.040
I’ll compensate you with 10 or 15 million
from my share and move on.

27:46.120 --> 27:47.880
-Do you reckon?
-15 million?

27:48.280 --> 27:49.760
15 million, don’t piss me off.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.520
We go and screw everything. 15 million.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.280
-15 million euros.
-I can sign it on paper if you want.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.360
-For a button?
-For a button.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.280
-Leave him, Berlin.
-What’s going on here?

28:01.440 --> 28:02.960
Nothing is going on.

28:04.840 --> 28:05.760
It’s funny.

28:06.080 --> 28:08.360
I came here... with the idea

28:08.440 --> 28:12.040
of shooting you like, I don’t know,
in his feet to compensate

28:12.120 --> 28:15.200
and I’m beginning to feel like
shooting him in the head

28:15.280 --> 28:16.720
and I don’t quite know why.

28:25.840 --> 28:26.800
Berlin.

28:27.240 --> 28:29.200
Yes... Shush.

28:40.760 --> 28:41.640
Thank you.

28:56.080 --> 28:59.200
Retroxil, it’s a rare medicine,
made to order.

29:00.040 --> 29:01.720
It’s used to palliate trembling

29:01.800 --> 29:04.560
caused by a very unusual
degenerative neuronal disease.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.320
What?

29:07.000 --> 29:08.640
Helmers’ Myopathy.

29:09.560 --> 29:12.200
The Russians launched this medicine
four years ago

29:12.280 --> 29:13.520
and apparently it was successful.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.720
They were able to change
the outcome of Fonollosa's disease

29:15.800 --> 29:18.160
from being a lethal disease
for all those who suffer it

29:18.240 --> 29:19.880
to only nine out of ten dying.

29:20.840 --> 29:24.920
So if... Mr Fonollosa is not that one,

29:25.560 --> 29:27.720
he’ll be dead in less than 24 months.

29:34.280 --> 29:36.000
That man has nothing to lose.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.920
But it’s not necessary...

30:15.760 --> 30:16.680
Denver.

30:19.400 --> 30:20.680
Denver, is it you?

30:51.120 --> 30:52.920
I ordered you to kill her on Friday.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.520
And today is Sunday.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.760
Resurrection Sunday!

31:06.080 --> 31:08.200
Praise the Lord.

31:08.840 --> 31:11.720
Sorry, I’ll let you finish in peace.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.120
It won’t be me who disturbs your privacy.

31:36.440 --> 31:38.280
I'm making you a confession, Denver.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.280
When I saw her there lying on the floor,
dead,

31:43.920 --> 31:45.280
something inside me was not right.

31:46.960 --> 31:48.480
Sometimes I rush into things.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.400
This temper of mine.

31:55.760 --> 31:59.000
However, it’s clear
that this situation is still uncomfortable

31:59.080 --> 32:01.720
and we’ll have to do something about it,
but, what?

32:02.720 --> 32:05.720
On one side of the scales,
Denver, there are the bad things.

32:09.400 --> 32:10.680
You disobeyed me.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.200
I asked you to kill her,

32:21.360 --> 32:23.960
because that woman
had compromised our plan.

32:24.560 --> 32:28.080
Our plan. And you spared her.
And let’s not talk about the button,

32:29.040 --> 32:33.040
that, due to your ineptitude,
has put my face in TV news,

32:33.120 --> 32:35.800
airports, police stations...

32:36.360 --> 32:39.440
And now for sure, you have definitely
spoiled any chance of future for me.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.160
And on the other side
of the scales, it’s...

32:43.160 --> 32:45.600
the fact that woman is alive.

32:46.800 --> 32:51.720
And I wonder: What side
of the scales do you think weighs more?

32:54.200 --> 32:57.440
Don’t be a motherfucker, Berlin,
this isn’t a film by Tarantino, eh?

32:57.640 --> 32:58.760
Put the gun down.

33:01.600 --> 33:02.680
Put the gun down.

33:07.240 --> 33:08.880
Nairobi, you put the gun down.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.320
-What?
-You put your gun down.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.600
Let’s work this out, put the gun down.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.040
Put the gun down.

33:30.680 --> 33:33.560
Whose head are you going
to blow now, eh, freak?

33:34.840 --> 33:37.920
Let’s all calm down and put the guns down.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.640
Berlin, Denver, everyone, you, too.

33:40.720 --> 33:41.880
Tell your cousin, come on.

33:45.960 --> 33:49.240
I’m tired of your orders
and your fucking speeches.

33:49.320 --> 33:52.520
Shall I tell you what side of the scales
weighs mores, shall I tell you?

33:57.840 --> 33:59.480
Wait, Denver, calm down.

34:00.880 --> 34:03.080
I’ll tell you, don’t move.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.040
-Careful.
-No, listen to me.

34:12.080 --> 34:13.480
You know what weighs more?

34:18.920 --> 34:20.760
Life, surely, Denver.

34:22.520 --> 34:26.320
Yes, it does. So this once, gentlemen,

34:26.960 --> 34:29.160
let’s put the guns down,

34:32.120 --> 34:35.960
because there are certain times...

34:36.040 --> 34:38.320
when life is a miracle

34:40.960 --> 34:42.400
that it’s good celebrating.

34:45.840 --> 34:46.720
What are you doing?

34:49.600 --> 34:53.600
-For fuck’s sake, is she alive?
-She’s alive, Tokyo.

34:55.440 --> 34:56.600
Look at her, Denver.

34:57.360 --> 35:00.280
Like those flowers that grow
in the cracked pavement.

35:01.800 --> 35:02.680
That’s it.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.360
-That’s it, yes.
-That’s it.

35:06.240 --> 35:07.280
That’s it.

35:13.320 --> 35:16.520
Berlin, I’m sorry to interrupt you,
but you have to come up,

35:17.360 --> 35:18.760
the Professor is on the phone.

35:31.760 --> 35:33.800
-"Are you there?"
-Where were you?

35:34.440 --> 35:36.000
"Let’s say in a sort of..."

35:37.080 --> 35:38.280
spiritual trip.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.280
And I have returned as a new man.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.320
I’m glad.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.360
Because there’s something important
you need to know.

35:51.840 --> 35:52.800
I put the button

35:52.960 --> 35:54.440
"of your jacket in the Seat Ibiza.

35:56.880 --> 36:00.160
You killed a hostage,
you stepped over the red line,

36:00.240 --> 36:01.760
so this is your punishment."

36:02.200 --> 36:05.560
It hurts to hear that, it hurts terribly.

36:06.640 --> 36:09.840
And, honestly, I believe
it’s a very unfair measure.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.800
You see, I want you
to listen to something.

36:24.720 --> 36:25.680
What’s your name?

36:27.000 --> 36:28.640
My name is Mónica Gaztambide.

36:30.040 --> 36:31.680
-"And how are you?
-Fine."

36:32.400 --> 36:34.400
-And you’re alive.
-I’m alive.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.240
And she’s very pretty. Thank you.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.280
"Do you understand now
why I think you are unfair?

36:45.360 --> 36:47.320
You punish me for something
that still hasn’t happened."

36:47.400 --> 36:48.640
I admire your cynicism.

36:49.080 --> 36:52.440
"But I understand that if that woman
is still alive, it's not thanks to you."

36:52.880 --> 36:54.640
Unfortunately there’s no turning back.

36:55.040 --> 36:58.320
"The good news
for everyone is that thanks"

36:58.480 --> 37:01.560
to that happy outcome
we can proceed to plan Valencia.

37:05.480 --> 37:08.440
Gentlemen, plan Valencia is in action.

37:09.280 --> 37:10.360
Now.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.200
Fire!

37:26.720 --> 37:27.600
What’s that?

37:28.640 --> 37:30.120
Burst from an M-16.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.280
Several guns firing all at once.

37:33.360 --> 37:35.320
Turn up the reception,
There’s people screaming.

37:41.480 --> 37:48.280
And... scream! Louder!
With pain! With passion!

37:48.720 --> 37:50.120
Louder!

38:09.880 --> 38:11.720
I spoke to the scientific lab
and ballistics.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.920
I sent out the recordings
and they say they have

38:14.000 --> 38:16.240
-at least three M-16.
-How many bullets?

38:16.320 --> 38:19.040
150 approximately, five or six magazines.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.200
It’s a massacre.

38:20.280 --> 38:23.120
It’s not an execution, it’s an affray.
Put me through the Fábrica.

38:33.840 --> 38:36.160
"What the fuck is happening in there,
what have you done?"

38:37.560 --> 38:40.720
-Aren’t you going to say good evening?
-"Good evening?

38:41.960 --> 38:44.160
After you leaked our conversations
to the media,

38:44.240 --> 38:47.040
after you left me in a really bad position
before the public opinion

38:47.120 --> 38:49.160
and after hearing
that shooting inside there.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.960
-What sort of insane person are you?"
-Inspector, the truth is...

38:52.040 --> 38:54.960
I don’t recognize you.
You’re an intelligent woman.

38:55.040 --> 38:57.520
We have carried out this negotiation
with mutual respect,

38:57.600 --> 38:59.760
both professionally and personally.

38:59.840 --> 39:04.200
I’d dare to say that even
with some affection from my side.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.600
So I’ll hang the phone up
and we’ll start again.

39:06.680 --> 39:07.720
"What the...?"

39:41.840 --> 39:42.760
Phone.

39:48.960 --> 39:50.120
Good evening, Professor.

39:51.760 --> 39:52.640
Good evening.

39:53.080 --> 39:55.560
"You see... I was here..."

39:55.720 --> 39:57.720
thinking about things and...

39:58.600 --> 40:01.720
all of the sudden it crossed my mind:

40:01.960 --> 40:03.800
what kind of music will this man

40:04.160 --> 40:06.600
"listen to when he has a shower
in the morning?"

40:07.360 --> 40:10.000
Well, it’ll sound strange to you, but...

40:11.240 --> 40:12.960
what give the most energy...

40:13.880 --> 40:15.800
is a Greek Syrtaki dance.

40:16.120 --> 40:18.360
"I don’t know,
it makes me be in a good mood."

40:19.680 --> 40:23.120
How curious, isn’t it?
Are you of Greek ancestry?

40:23.360 --> 40:25.240
No, no, the truth is I’m not.

40:25.840 --> 40:29.120
But I don’t know,
I love the films Anthony Quinn is in.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.800
"It’s lively music, actually."

40:32.520 --> 40:35.400
Not so much as the shots
we heard inside there.

40:35.480 --> 40:36.760
"No, of course not."

40:37.600 --> 40:40.320
Could you tell me what exactly was that?

40:40.600 --> 40:43.800
Sure, I would be delighted to.
You see, we have been testing

40:43.880 --> 40:46.160
some guns we thought that had got wet,

40:46.240 --> 40:48.960
but they work just fine.
Thank you for asking.

40:49.120 --> 40:52.240
You’re welcome.
It’s a very plausible explanation,

40:52.320 --> 40:54.720
but there’s another possibility.

40:55.280 --> 40:57.360
"That all went wrong and you had"

40:57.520 --> 40:59.040
to open fire and shoot the hostages.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.560
Yes, that would be another possibility.

41:02.360 --> 41:05.400
I guess it’s up to you
to be more or less optimistic.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.000
So you won’t mind If I ask you something.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.440
"Inspector...,"

41:13.000 --> 41:14.080
I’m truly sorry,

41:15.320 --> 41:17.200
-but I’m a terrible dancer.
-Excuse me?

41:17.440 --> 41:19.880
"The Syrtaki... If you’re asking
me to dance with you,

41:19.960 --> 41:21.640
I’m very sorry, but it won’t be possible."

41:22.240 --> 41:23.440
"No, it’s not that."

41:24.480 --> 41:25.360
Look.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.480
I want a proof of life of each hostage,

41:30.080 --> 41:31.440
"recorded today,"

41:32.160 --> 41:34.720
in front of a television set broadcasting
live. And it’s not negotiable.

41:34.960 --> 41:38.320
I wouldn’t dare haggle
over something so delicate, inspector.

41:38.680 --> 41:40.360
You have an hour to send them over.

41:52.120 --> 41:54.480
-"Hello."
-Prepare the proofs of life.
