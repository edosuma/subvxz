WEBVTT

00:00.510 --> 00:03.000
Previously on Young Sheldon...
Would you teach me

00:03.000 --> 00:05.420
how to throw a baseball?
What's bringing this on?

00:08.170 --> 00:09.670
I don't know.
You Coach Ballard?

00:09.670 --> 00:10.920
That'd be me.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.380
My daughter's here to try out.

00:12.380 --> 00:13.720
She made the team.

00:13.720 --> 00:16.010
Congratulations.

00:16.010 --> 00:18.680
And Meemaw got a
date with the coach.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.390
I was married for 18 years,

00:20.390 --> 00:21.680
and I got to tell you,
those were the two best years

00:21.680 --> 00:24.350
of my life.
(laughs)

00:31.570 --> 00:33.610
Practice running late?

00:33.610 --> 00:35.110
Yeah.

00:35.110 --> 00:38.200
The Sparks kid got himself
stuck in the bathroom.

00:39.410 --> 00:41.120
How'd that happen?

00:41.120 --> 00:44.250
Well, the door's a push
and he was a-pulling.

00:44.250 --> 00:47.540
(chuckles)
Look at him out there.

00:47.540 --> 00:50.210
Billy's my grandson.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.470
Oh.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.220
I am so sorry. I...

00:55.220 --> 00:56.720
I mean, not that
he's your grandson.

00:56.720 --> 01:00.140
I'm just...
I'm-a stop talking now.

01:00.140 --> 01:02.640
I'm messing with you.
(chuckles)

01:02.640 --> 01:04.640
(both laugh)
Well...

01:04.640 --> 01:07.270
You got me, all right.

01:08.310 --> 01:09.610
Ah, no.

01:09.610 --> 01:13.900
That one's mine over there.
Evan.

01:13.900 --> 01:17.570
Oh, i-isn't that
the coach's grandson?

01:17.570 --> 01:18.910
Uh-huh.

01:18.910 --> 01:23.120
So you must be
Coach Ballard's ex-wife?

01:23.120 --> 01:25.410
Yeah. Why?

01:25.410 --> 01:29.340
(chuckles) No reason.

01:31.460 --> 01:34.420
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:34.420 --> 01:37.260
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

01:37.260 --> 01:39.800
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

01:39.800 --> 01:42.140
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

01:42.140 --> 01:46.350
♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪

01:49.480 --> 01:53.480
ADULT SHELDON:
Growing up, I had an aversion
to any type of group.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.490
For example, rock groups.

01:55.490 --> 01:59.780
I'll restrict my drug use
to Rolaids, thank you.

01:59.780 --> 02:02.200
Group costumes.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.950
I'll tell you who really didn't
have a heart: my mother,

02:04.950 --> 02:06.710
for making me wear
a funnel on my head.

02:06.710 --> 02:09.170
But of all the groups
I didn't like,

02:09.170 --> 02:11.460
by far the worst was...

02:11.460 --> 02:13.050
Group projects.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.460
(all groaning)

02:15.460 --> 02:17.220
Yeah. You heard me.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.470
This would be
a lot more fun with margaritas.

02:20.470 --> 02:22.220
What isn't?

02:22.220 --> 02:25.640
Then you'd love the way
I ran the PTA.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.310
And you'd love the way
I show up at church.

02:27.310 --> 02:28.560
(both laugh)

02:29.650 --> 02:31.650
You're fun.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.520
We ought to go out
for drinks one night.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.860
I'll give you my number.

02:34.860 --> 02:36.490
(quietly):
Oh, yeah. Oh, well...

02:36.490 --> 02:39.150
All right. I'm around
tomorrow if you're free.

02:39.150 --> 02:41.660
Uh, sure.

02:43.490 --> 02:45.160
You should
know something, though.

02:46.500 --> 02:51.040
Um, I'm kind of
dating your ex-husband.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.670
You waited till now to tell me?

02:55.670 --> 02:58.260
You're sneaky. I like that.

02:58.260 --> 02:59.930
That is not the feedback
I usually get.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.680
(both laugh)

03:01.680 --> 03:04.350
Well, since we're being honest,

03:04.350 --> 03:06.100
I knew who you were
the whole time.

03:06.100 --> 03:08.350
That's why I came over here.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.900
Damn. Nicely played.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.190
So we're still on for drinks?

03:16.190 --> 03:17.780
Oh, hell yeah.
(both laugh)

03:17.780 --> 03:20.070
Yeehaw.

03:21.450 --> 03:23.910
Can't we just
do this individually?

03:23.910 --> 03:26.450
Why are you complaining? I'm the
one stuck working with a kid.

03:26.450 --> 03:29.290
Hey. When it comes to physics,
I'm practically a coot.

03:29.290 --> 03:31.960
Which is an old person word
for someone who's old.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.210
Tell him.

03:33.210 --> 03:34.540
It is.
SAM:
Let's just go

03:34.540 --> 03:36.420
to a coffee shop
and get this over with.

03:36.420 --> 03:39.050
I can't go now. I have to get
home for my bath and bedtime.

03:39.050 --> 03:41.090
Which is also something
an old person does.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.380
That we do.

03:42.380 --> 03:44.050
Can I at least switch groups?

03:44.050 --> 03:47.060
Sorry. I assigned this project
because it's important

03:47.060 --> 03:50.890
for scientists to learn
how to collaborate.

03:50.890 --> 03:52.390
If we must work together,
here's my proposal.

03:54.060 --> 03:56.070
I do everything by myself
and put their names on it.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.900
No.
What's going on?

03:57.900 --> 03:59.990
Dr. Sturgis is forcing us
to collaborate.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.240
Oh...

04:01.240 --> 04:02.780
And we wanted to
get it done tonight,

04:02.780 --> 04:04.910
but apparently there's a
bedtime and shower conflict.

04:04.910 --> 04:06.120
Bubble bath.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.950
Oh, right, it's bath night.

04:07.950 --> 04:09.830
How about we work
in my dorm tomorrow?

04:09.830 --> 04:11.620
MARY:
Um, I don't know

04:11.620 --> 04:15.250
if a dormitory is the right
environment for someone his age.

04:15.250 --> 04:16.630
If you're worried
about the beer-drinking,

04:16.630 --> 04:19.420
Dad has thoroughly
desensitized me.

04:19.420 --> 04:22.970
How about you all
come work at our house?

04:22.970 --> 04:24.930
(sighs) I guess
if that's our only option.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.430
It'll be fun. I'll make food.

04:27.430 --> 04:29.430
You can even bring your laundry.

04:29.430 --> 04:30.640
That actually would be great.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.430
Now this man's soiled underpants

04:32.430 --> 04:33.980
will be in my kitchen.

04:33.980 --> 04:35.310
Thank you.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.990
I-I just don't understand
why you want to go out with her.

04:40.990 --> 04:43.320
You don't? She seems like fun.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.280
Well, yeah, she is,
until you marry her

04:45.280 --> 04:48.280
and then you find her sleeping
upside down in the closet.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.490
(laughs)
No, I mean,
seriously.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.540
You don't think
that having drinks

04:51.540 --> 04:53.790
with my ex-wife
is a little weird?

04:53.790 --> 04:55.370
You went camping with John.

04:55.370 --> 04:56.880
Oh, it was weird.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.630
Trust me.
Learn from me.

04:58.630 --> 05:01.550
She spent 18 years with you.
I'd rather learn from her.

05:01.550 --> 05:04.170
So you can dig up
a little dirt on me?

05:04.170 --> 05:05.800
Mm, yeah.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.390
Well, let me spoil it, then.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.050
She's gonna tell you
about the time

05:09.050 --> 05:11.180
I had a little too much
to drink on Halloween

05:11.180 --> 05:14.020
and I ended up puking
in my son's candy bucket.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.350
I bet she tells it better.

05:15.350 --> 05:16.980
Then there was the time
we had a fight

05:16.980 --> 05:19.150
and I locked her out
in a hailstorm.
Damn.

05:19.150 --> 05:21.650
But in my defense, when I locked
her out it, it was raining.

05:21.650 --> 05:24.190
The hail was heaven-sent.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.650
You're a charmer.

05:26.530 --> 05:28.320
So...

05:28.320 --> 05:31.160
You didn't do anything you
regret when you were married?

05:31.160 --> 05:33.080
Oh, lots of stuff.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.660
Feel free to grab a shovel

05:34.660 --> 05:36.420
and go have some drinks
with my dead husband.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.170
Oh, that's dark.

05:38.170 --> 05:40.170
Not as dark as my secrets.

05:40.170 --> 05:43.920
Oh, you-you... You are so hot.

05:46.010 --> 05:48.010
Ooh, chocolate chip.

05:48.010 --> 05:50.720
Just one. The rest
are for Sheldon's friends.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.350
Ready to go?
Yep.
Go where?

05:52.350 --> 05:53.720
The mall.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.020
What happened to
asking for permission?

05:55.020 --> 05:56.850
I asked Dad.

05:56.850 --> 05:58.770
You know that doesn't count.

05:58.770 --> 06:00.360
That's what he said.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.770
(doorbell rings)
GEORGE JR.: Bye.

06:01.770 --> 06:03.530
MISSY:
Love you.
(door closes)

06:05.740 --> 06:07.450
Keith, Sam, come in.

06:07.450 --> 06:08.950
Sheldon, your friends are here.

06:08.950 --> 06:10.620
Let me put

06:10.620 --> 06:12.530
that laundry in for you.
Oh, thank you.

06:12.530 --> 06:13.870
None for you?

06:13.870 --> 06:15.950
That's okay.
I can do my own laundry.

06:15.950 --> 06:18.540
Oh. Okay.

06:18.540 --> 06:20.540
Hello, Sam, Keith,

06:20.540 --> 06:23.550
big bag of dirty underpants.

06:25.050 --> 06:26.920
Hey, there.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.050
I hope you don't mind,
I started without you.

06:29.050 --> 06:30.800
Not at all.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.970
Is this one for me or am I gonna
be carrying you home tonight?

06:33.970 --> 06:36.100
(chuckles)
It's all yours.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.770
(laughs)
Cheers.

06:39.230 --> 06:40.770
I like your blouse.
Oh, you do?

06:40.770 --> 06:44.570
Truth be told,
I changed my outfit three times.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.400
For little old me?

06:46.400 --> 06:49.740
Well, I've never gotten drinks
with a boyfriend's ex-wife.

06:50.950 --> 06:52.490
Do you try to look hot

06:52.490 --> 06:53.740
or do you try to look like
you're not trying?

06:53.740 --> 06:55.660
Well, clearly, you went for hot.

06:55.660 --> 06:57.250
I wasn't even trying.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.750
(laughs)

06:58.750 --> 07:00.460
I think we can explain
the additional electrons

07:00.460 --> 07:02.750
if we assume the barrier
has a slope to it.

07:02.750 --> 07:05.420
That won't work.
Okay, well,
what if the electrons

07:05.420 --> 07:07.670
are a product of...
We need to consider
that the electrons

07:07.670 --> 07:09.930
are actually
moving backwards in time.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.140
No, that math's
gonna take forever.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.430
Let's just do it my way.

07:12.430 --> 07:13.970
Can you write on the board?

07:13.970 --> 07:15.470
You probably have
the best handwriting.

07:15.470 --> 07:16.930
Why? Because I'm a girl?

07:16.930 --> 07:18.520
I'm sure it's better than mine.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.440
I only learned to write
six years ago.

07:22.860 --> 07:26.110
Well, we've covered football
and grandkids...

07:26.110 --> 07:27.940
Our favorite Golden Girl.

07:27.940 --> 07:30.530
Did not peg you for a Dorothy.

07:30.530 --> 07:33.280
What have we left out?

07:33.280 --> 07:35.830
Hmm. I don't know.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.450
Maybe we've run out
of stuff to talk about.

07:38.450 --> 07:42.120
Oh, wait. We forgot
about your ex-husband.

07:42.120 --> 07:45.000
(laughs)
The one you're dating.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.300
Ah...

07:46.300 --> 07:47.880
What do you want to know?

07:47.880 --> 07:50.300
Well, I know not to piss him off
during a hailstorm.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.720
He told you that?

07:51.720 --> 07:53.140
He wanted to throw himself
under the bus

07:53.140 --> 07:54.970
rather than let you push him.

07:54.970 --> 07:58.310
Well, did he tell you that I was
naked when he locked me out?

07:58.310 --> 08:01.190
No! Why did he do that?

08:01.190 --> 08:02.730
'Cause I was trying
to hit him with a golf club.

08:02.730 --> 08:04.560
(laughs):
What were you doing naked

08:04.560 --> 08:06.820
with a golf club in a hailstorm?

08:06.820 --> 08:10.320
Uh, you know, it was the '70s.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.360
I remember. What else you got?

08:13.360 --> 08:15.990
CUSTOMER 1:
Hey, there's my man!
(cheering, applause)

08:15.990 --> 08:17.700
The doctor's in the house!

08:18.740 --> 08:21.040
Hello, y'all!
Oh, boy.

08:25.890 --> 08:27.720
Hey!

08:28.970 --> 08:30.390
Connie!

08:30.390 --> 08:32.230
Hey, John.

08:32.230 --> 08:33.810
How?

08:33.810 --> 08:35.650
We used to date.

08:35.650 --> 08:37.980
So you dated him and Dale?

08:37.980 --> 08:40.070
You don't have a type, do you?

08:40.070 --> 08:41.400
What are you doing here?

08:41.400 --> 08:43.150
Me? What are you doing here?

08:43.150 --> 08:45.200
Well, this is where
I hang out now.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.860
I grade papers,

08:46.860 --> 08:48.990
I chat with the other patrons.

08:48.990 --> 08:54.210
The people who like to bet on
football rub my head for luck.

08:54.210 --> 08:55.500
(laughs)

08:55.500 --> 08:57.040
John, this is June.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.710
Hi.
June.

08:58.710 --> 09:03.670
After Juno, wife of Jupiter
and queen of the gods.

09:03.670 --> 09:07.550
No, after the fact that my mom
got knocked up in June.

09:07.550 --> 09:09.850
Ribald! Wonderful.
(laughs)

09:09.850 --> 09:11.680
(chuckles)
So, um,

09:11.680 --> 09:13.720
how do you two know each other?

09:13.720 --> 09:15.690
Well, June here, actually,

09:15.690 --> 09:17.190
is Dale's ex-wife.

09:17.190 --> 09:20.940
And I am Connie's ex-boyfriend.

09:20.940 --> 09:24.740
(laughs) Is that fun or weird?

09:24.740 --> 09:26.530
Yeah.

09:26.530 --> 09:29.700
Okay.
Okay.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.910
Okay.

09:34.870 --> 09:37.120
All right, something's
not working out here.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.420
Perhaps it's the way
you're pacing.

09:38.420 --> 09:40.290
Pick a number of steps
and stick to it.

09:40.290 --> 09:42.300
Maybe it's because
you two aren't helping.

09:42.300 --> 09:44.460
Oh, really? But I'm writing
with my prettiest handwriting.

09:44.460 --> 09:46.220
Don't be a child.
Hey!

09:46.220 --> 09:48.090
Oh, you were talking to her.

09:48.090 --> 09:50.550
Who wants pigs in a blanket?

09:50.550 --> 09:51.760
Actually, do you have coffee?

09:51.760 --> 09:53.560
I just made a pot,
help yourself.

09:55.730 --> 09:58.480
Anything I could get you?
I need a cigarette.

10:01.610 --> 10:02.940
So how's it going?

10:02.940 --> 10:04.780
Great. Now that
those two are gone,

10:04.780 --> 10:07.610
I can finally
get some work done.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.080
They call it
"Hot Dog on a Stick,"

10:14.080 --> 10:16.290
but that's not the only food
on a stick they sell.

10:16.290 --> 10:17.790
It's not?

10:17.790 --> 10:19.750
They also got
cheese on a stick.
Oh, no.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.760
You hiding
from that guy?
No.

10:25.760 --> 10:27.920
Oh, I get it,
you like him.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.340
Shut up.

10:29.340 --> 10:30.930
Aren't you a little young
for that?

10:30.930 --> 10:33.260
How old were you
when you started liking girls?

10:34.430 --> 10:35.850
DAISY DUKE:
Buh-bye. Bye.

10:35.850 --> 10:38.270
Hey, everybody,
free drinks on the house!

10:38.270 --> 10:39.940
Dang.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.940
Way older than you.

10:41.940 --> 10:45.150
(sighs) Doesn't matter,
he doesn't like me anyway.

10:45.150 --> 10:47.360
Sorry.

10:49.030 --> 10:51.820
I liked it better when you
wanted to marry ALF.

10:51.820 --> 10:54.120
I still kind of do.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.830
So you went camping with Dale?
How'd that go?

10:57.830 --> 11:00.160
Oh, I hesitate
to speak ill of him...

11:00.160 --> 11:01.960
I divorced him.
Say what you want.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.630
Then, it was terrible.
Ah-ha!

11:04.630 --> 11:06.550
All right, come on, let's talk
about something else.

11:06.550 --> 11:08.130
Okay.

11:08.130 --> 11:09.840
A lot of people here
like to talk about the game.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.130
Really? You speak sports now?

11:12.130 --> 11:16.470
I sure do. Check this out.

11:16.470 --> 11:20.980
Hey, ref! I suggest you
go back to referee school

11:20.980 --> 11:25.020
and this time
pay attention in class!

11:25.020 --> 11:27.690
(cheering, laughter)
You tell him, Doc.

11:27.690 --> 11:29.150
You're a doctor?

11:29.150 --> 11:30.990
He has his PhD in physics,

11:30.990 --> 11:34.490
but his specialty
is quantum chromodynamics.

11:34.490 --> 11:37.030
Wow, that sounds interesting.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.750
Oh, it is. And I would
tell you more about it,

11:39.750 --> 11:42.830
but I'm lucky I remembered
the quantum chromodynamics.

11:42.830 --> 11:46.000
(laughing) And you didn't even
have to rub his head.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.210
Well, it's here
if the mood strikes.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.550
Ugh, come on, Bucky,

11:52.550 --> 11:54.720
try throwing it to someone
on your own team.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.010
Is that the Aggie game?

11:56.010 --> 11:59.520
Yeah, we're down by ten.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.350
You like A&M?

12:01.350 --> 12:03.850
I was raised a Cornhusker,
but when in Texas...

12:03.850 --> 12:08.400
Huh, science and sports?
Didn't know that was a thing.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.360
It is possible to be a scientist
and a normal guy.

12:11.360 --> 12:15.360
May your team be victorious!

12:15.360 --> 12:17.030
(cheering)
(laughs)

12:17.030 --> 12:19.370
Not my experience.

12:24.750 --> 12:26.630
I brought you
some coffee.

12:26.630 --> 12:28.290
You don't have to keep
waiting on us.

12:28.290 --> 12:31.050
I'm sorry, is there a problem?

12:32.590 --> 12:33.880
(sighs)

12:33.880 --> 12:36.720
I'm just frustrated.
Is it Sheldon?

12:36.720 --> 12:40.430
It's Sheldon and Keith and
every other guy in our field,

12:40.430 --> 12:42.060
which is basically
everyone.

12:42.060 --> 12:43.480
There were only
three other women

12:43.480 --> 12:45.810
and one of them just dropped out
to get married.

12:45.810 --> 12:47.730
Oh, good for her.

12:47.730 --> 12:50.940
O-Or bad, bad for science,
bad for women.

12:50.940 --> 12:53.440
None of the guys in my class
take me seriously,

12:53.440 --> 12:55.740
and honestly, it doesn't help
when women like you

12:55.740 --> 12:57.950
run around doing their laundry
and making them snacks.

12:57.950 --> 13:00.740
I'm just being
a good host.

13:00.740 --> 13:02.830
Yeah, and raising another boy
to think that all women

13:02.830 --> 13:05.120
are just notetakers
and mommies.

13:05.120 --> 13:08.790
I'm sorry I'm making life
so hard for you.

13:10.460 --> 13:13.170
And for your
information,

13:13.170 --> 13:15.420
Sheldon does not
look down on women,

13:15.420 --> 13:18.590
he looks down
on everyone.

13:24.130 --> 13:25.840
GEORGE JR.: Friday the
Thirteenth Part VIII:

13:25.840 --> 13:28.300
Jason Takes Manhattan
might be the best one.

13:28.300 --> 13:32.640
Muppets also took Manhattan.
There he is again.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.640
Why don't you
go talk to him?

13:34.640 --> 13:37.350
Are you crazy?
Look how beautiful he is.

13:39.060 --> 13:41.320
Sorry, the only guy
I'm calling beautiful is me.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.860
And maybe David Hasselhoff.

13:43.860 --> 13:45.570
(sighs)

13:45.570 --> 13:49.870
I understand that you want to be
appreciated for what you do,

13:49.870 --> 13:51.330
but so do I.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.040
This is my home
and taking care of my family

13:54.040 --> 13:56.830
is the choice that I've made,
and I am proud to do it.

13:56.830 --> 13:58.670
Okay.

13:58.670 --> 14:01.500
It is okay.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.710
And I am sorry
if me baking cookies

14:04.710 --> 14:06.590
says something bad
about women,

14:06.590 --> 14:09.050
but if you think that Sheldon
is difficult to work with now,

14:09.050 --> 14:11.100
you should try him
with low blood sugar,

14:11.100 --> 14:13.220
he is a monster.

14:14.850 --> 14:16.520
Someone's got to be
in charge,

14:16.520 --> 14:18.520
but when you step up and do it,
everyone gets upset.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.900
So your problem is
a woman's mad at you

14:21.900 --> 14:23.360
and Sheldon thinks you're dumb?

14:23.360 --> 14:26.190
Yeah.
Welcome to my life, friend.

14:26.190 --> 14:27.570
W-What do I do?

14:27.570 --> 14:30.570
(chuckles)
You-you quit complaining.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.240
You're young, you're smart,

14:32.240 --> 14:34.370
you're not
tied down.

14:34.370 --> 14:36.910
This is as good as it gets.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.210
It is?

14:38.210 --> 14:39.750
Yes.

14:39.750 --> 14:42.040
I wish I was 20 again.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.590
Eating and drinking
and being skinny.

14:44.590 --> 14:47.380
Now go back in there,
finish your project,

14:47.380 --> 14:49.260
and get your ass
to a keg party.

14:50.050 --> 14:52.260
Go!

14:52.260 --> 14:54.760
ADULT SHELDON: Somehow,
my parents calmed everyone down

14:54.760 --> 14:56.390
and got us back on track.

14:56.390 --> 14:58.230
We listened
to each other's thoughts,

14:58.230 --> 15:00.440
and we worked as a team...

15:00.440 --> 15:02.560
for almost four whole minutes.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.230
All right, that doesn't
make any sense.

15:04.230 --> 15:05.480
Because you don't understand it.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.240
It makes total sense, Keith.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.320
SHELDON: Please, just take
your underpants and go.

15:13.410 --> 15:14.950
Just say hi,
keep it casual,

15:14.950 --> 15:16.410
pretend like you
don't care that much.

15:16.410 --> 15:18.330
But I care the most.

15:18.330 --> 15:19.790
See, that's gonna
freak him out.

15:19.790 --> 15:22.000
How do you know?
'Cause it's freaking me out.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.170
Now go.

15:32.590 --> 15:35.100
(inaudible dialogue)

15:37.100 --> 15:39.140
(laughs)

15:39.140 --> 15:42.020
No touching!
That's right, you heard me!

15:46.870 --> 15:49.380
(telephone ringing)
Hello?

15:49.380 --> 15:50.920
Hi, Connie.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.630
Hi, John.

15:52.630 --> 15:55.720
It was a nice surprise
running into you the other day.

15:55.720 --> 15:56.930
It was.

15:56.930 --> 15:58.760
Anyway, question:

15:58.760 --> 16:02.560
Do you think your friend June is
interested in me romantically?

16:02.560 --> 16:05.060
Oh, I...

16:05.060 --> 16:07.440
Gee, I don't know.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.730
I only ask because
I'm not good at knowing

16:09.730 --> 16:11.320
what other people are feeling.

16:11.320 --> 16:12.650
I'm aware.

16:12.650 --> 16:15.400
So could you ask her for me?
No.

16:15.400 --> 16:18.110
You're right,
I should probably do it myself.

16:18.110 --> 16:19.570
Can I have her number?

16:19.570 --> 16:23.290
Well, you won over a whole bar,

16:23.290 --> 16:25.620
maybe you could
win over June, too.

16:25.620 --> 16:27.620
(telephone ringing)

16:30.130 --> 16:31.420
Hello?

16:31.420 --> 16:33.590
Hi, June. John Sturgis here.

16:33.590 --> 16:35.800
We met the other day.

16:35.800 --> 16:39.680
I'm, uh, the scientist
who won over the whole bar.

16:39.680 --> 16:41.640
Oh, sure, I remember you.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.180
Good, good. Anyway,

16:44.180 --> 16:47.810
I was wondering if you had
any romantic interest in me.

16:47.810 --> 16:49.980
Well, you don't
beat around the bush, do you?

16:49.980 --> 16:51.650
In medieval times,

16:51.650 --> 16:55.150
hunters used to hire men
to beat the area around bushes

16:55.150 --> 16:59.780
with sticks in order
to flush out game, so no,

16:59.780 --> 17:01.660
I guess I don't do that.

17:01.660 --> 17:03.830
John,

17:03.830 --> 17:06.450
you're a really sweet guy,

17:06.450 --> 17:08.460
but I didn't feel like

17:08.460 --> 17:11.540
we had that kind of connection.

17:11.540 --> 17:14.550
Oh. I see.

17:14.550 --> 17:15.960
I'm sorry.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.840
No, that's all right. Um...

17:18.840 --> 17:20.340
You know, the truth is,

17:20.340 --> 17:23.390
I'm-I'm still kind of
heartbroken over Connie,

17:23.390 --> 17:25.850
and, uh, I was hoping if

17:25.850 --> 17:27.640
someone else liked me,

17:27.640 --> 17:30.350
it might make it hurt less.

17:30.350 --> 17:33.480
Well, I don't know
either one of you very well,

17:33.480 --> 17:36.150
but I wouldn't write off
Connie just yet.

17:36.150 --> 17:39.320
Why? Did she say something?

17:39.320 --> 17:42.820
No, but, uh, it's just the way
she looked at you.

17:42.820 --> 17:45.200
See? That's what
I'm terrible at.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.080
How do you people do it?

17:47.080 --> 17:50.040
Look, I know she's
with Dale right now,

17:50.040 --> 17:52.040
but we were married
for a long time.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.750
Trust me,
he's gonna screw this up.

17:54.750 --> 17:58.840
Follow up question: Should I
mention any of this to Connie?

17:58.840 --> 18:00.880
Mm, I wouldn't.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.510
Excellent. Bye.
