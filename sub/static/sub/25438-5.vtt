-[camera shutters clicking]
-[woman] It's the wolf girl!

00:12.345 --> 00:13.179
Hello.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.098
[woman] We want Liberty Belle!

00:15.181 --> 00:17.809
-[man] What's your name again?
-[woman] Is Welfare Queen coming out?

00:17.934 --> 00:20.770
-[woman 2] Is Liberty Belle coming?
<i>-</i>Goodbye.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.897
[man] Sheila! Sheila! Wait...

00:24.065 --> 00:25.191
You're my favorite.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.485
I can see that.

00:29.195 --> 00:32.407
Is Sheila your real name?
Are those your real teeth?

00:32.991 --> 00:34.325
Do you have a boyfriend?

00:34.826 --> 00:38.246
I drove all the way here from Bakersfield!
At least give me a hug!

00:38.830 --> 00:41.875
-Just let me smell your neck!
-[Sheila panting]

00:44.044 --> 00:45.420
[men and women booing]

00:45.503 --> 00:48.089
[speaking Russian]
[in Russian accent] My public!

00:48.173 --> 00:50.508
[man] When are you gonna fight
Liberty Belle again?

00:50.592 --> 00:52.594
[man 2 shouts]

00:53.428 --> 00:55.430
[dramatic fanfare plays]

01:00.435 --> 01:03.480
[sighs] They didn't offer us any water.
It's a bad sign.

01:03.563 --> 01:06.232
They never give bad news in a meeting.
Bad news is a phone call.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.776
No fucking water, no fucking respect.

01:07.859 --> 01:10.779
I believe there is a water fountain
by the men's room, if you're thirsty.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.073
Sam! My favorite auteur.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.158
-Bash, Mr. Super Producer.
-[Bash] Yeah!

01:15.241 --> 01:18.078
And of course,
our own beautiful Liberty Belle.

01:18.161 --> 01:18.995
Hey.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.956
-Aww.
-I'm feeling more patriotic already.

01:22.665 --> 01:25.251
Lots of exciting stuff. Thanks for coming
in on such short notice.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.461
We're all big fans.

01:26.544 --> 01:29.380
Patio Town is withdrawing
their sponsorship from the show.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.216
What? Wait. They're-- Why?

01:31.508 --> 01:34.594
Uh, they had an issue
with the lawn chair bit in your match.

01:34.677 --> 01:37.222
The-- Whoa! That was completely unplanned.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.349
We had no idea
that it was gonna break like that.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.227
And they had a little issue with the PSA.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.980
Seems Patrick O'Towne's mother was 15
when he was born,

01:46.064 --> 01:49.526
so while he's not an advocate
for teen pregnancy...

01:49.859 --> 01:51.528
It-- it was a different time!

01:51.986 --> 01:55.240
All right, so the birdbath king is out.
We'll get another sponsor.

01:55.323 --> 01:58.284
It might be a little tricky
with the ratings being so soft.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.121
What? What are you talking about,
the ratings are soft?

02:01.204 --> 02:04.332
-You just said they loved us.
-Why are we only hearing this now?

02:04.415 --> 02:08.336
Frankly, we were hoping for a boost
from your big match with Welfare Queen,

02:08.419 --> 02:10.380
after the big marketing push we did.

02:10.463 --> 02:13.883
Yeah. I saw the billboard behind the DMV
in Encino.

02:13.967 --> 02:17.887
Look, Glen. We have fans! Okay?
I mean, the girls get letters.

02:17.971 --> 02:22.016
There's weirdos waiting outside for 'em
outside the stage door. I'm telling you.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.269
The audience is out there. So...

02:25.854 --> 02:27.605
-Okay.
-Okay.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.400
-Here... is the big news.
-What?

02:30.692 --> 02:34.362
Tom Grant, head of the network,
has taken a real interest in the show.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.239
You know, thinks it has real potential.

02:36.322 --> 02:39.951
Especially with the fun kidnapping
story line you just kicked off.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.619
Oh, is that so, Glen?

02:41.870 --> 02:44.873
Yeah, and he wants to meet with all of you
in a couple days,

02:44.956 --> 02:48.543
hear what you have in mind going forward,
see what makes sense for us...

02:48.626 --> 02:50.587
Uh, great! That sounds great!

02:50.670 --> 02:53.840
So he wants us to sell him the season
we're already making.

02:53.923 --> 02:56.551
-[laughs] You're gonna love Tom.
-[Sam] Mm.

02:56.634 --> 03:00.263
Used to work for Brandon Tartikoff.
He's one of us.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.223
Oh, yeah. I'm not Jewish.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.894
No, I-- I meant an artist.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.562
Sure, yeah.

03:07.645 --> 03:11.024
Look, here is your chance
to impress the hell out of him!

03:11.107 --> 03:13.067
Turn him into your number one fan!

03:13.151 --> 03:17.322
This kind of opportunity does not
present itself every day, folks. Right?

03:17.947 --> 03:19.782
-Right?
-Hey, Glen.

03:20.491 --> 03:22.869
Could I trouble you for a drink of water?

03:22.952 --> 03:24.621
There's a water fountain
next to the bathroom.

03:24.704 --> 03:25.622
Uh-huh.

03:27.665 --> 03:28.583
Yeah.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.295
-[Dawn] You're popular.
-[Carmen laughs]

03:32.503 --> 03:35.882
-[Dawn] And you're like... second popular.
-[Rhonda] Ooh!

03:35.965 --> 03:37.592
This one's from San Diego.

03:37.675 --> 03:40.929
"Dear Britannica, you may be
the smartest woman in the world,

03:41.012 --> 03:43.389
-but you are also the most beautiful.
-[all] Ooh!

03:43.473 --> 03:45.225
I wish I had gone to medical school,

03:45.308 --> 03:47.560
so I could tell you to say 'ah'
with this."

03:49.229 --> 03:50.063
Oh!

03:50.146 --> 03:53.483
[laughs] Interesting location
for a "Mom" tattoo!

03:53.566 --> 03:56.069
-[both shriek]
-Okay, they must be very close.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.904
[Stacey] Is there a ring on there?

03:57.987 --> 03:59.155
Yes.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.866
"Have you ever read anything
by Immanuel Kant?

04:01.991 --> 04:06.663
-He is my favorite." [chuckles]
-Ah! An intellectual sexual predator!

04:06.746 --> 04:08.164
You're so lucky!

04:08.248 --> 04:11.668
All my letters are from little girls
who like my hair glitter!

04:11.751 --> 04:12.710
I don't care.

04:12.794 --> 04:13.753
[Cherry clears throat]

04:13.836 --> 04:17.173
Oh, sorry, Cher.
I didn't mean to disturb you.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.591
Thought you were dead.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.677
This is the most fan mail
I've ever gotten.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.429
All I had to do was
completely degrade myself in public.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.306
[chuckling]

04:25.723 --> 04:26.641
Wait.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.185
We gotta capitalize on this.

04:29.644 --> 04:32.021
We gotta make some extra cash
while the getting's good.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.147
Like sell merch?

04:33.231 --> 04:36.776
No, <i>we're </i>the merch.
We're gonna set up tables after the show.

04:36.859 --> 04:38.319
We can do, like, a meet and greet.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.488
Ten bucks for an autograph,
20 for a photo.

04:40.571 --> 04:43.574
I don't know.
Some of these guys seem like major pervs.

04:43.658 --> 04:44.993
[Ruth] I love this idea!

04:45.076 --> 04:48.579
And not just because of the money.
I mean, these are our fans.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.207
We owe them our gratitude and respect.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.502
-That's right. Perverts are people, too.
-Okay, so everyone's in.

04:55.003 --> 04:58.798
Oh, Bash! Can we set up
an autograph table after the show?

04:59.340 --> 05:00.717
Can you? Hmm...

05:00.800 --> 05:02.051
Uh, of course!

05:02.135 --> 05:03.094
[Dawn] Yes!

05:03.428 --> 05:05.096
[Bash] Fan outreach, that's the spirit.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.224
-Carmen, can I borrow the key from you?
-There, on the table.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.643
-[Stacey] Ooh!
-[Dawn laughing]

05:11.144 --> 05:13.062
Oh, my God. What was that?

05:13.563 --> 05:14.397
What?

05:14.939 --> 05:18.276
Are you sleeping with Bash? [laughs]

05:18.359 --> 05:19.986
He's just sleeping in my room.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.154
<i>Our</i> room, actually.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.614
But he sleeps in my sleeping bag.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.910
It has Garfield on it.
And it takes up the whole floor.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.290
Jesus! Don't you knock?

05:35.752 --> 05:37.211
Rhonda's starting to get upset.

05:37.295 --> 05:41.591
[sighs] All right. Look, I'm sorry, okay?
It's just...

05:42.550 --> 05:43.968
things are hard right now.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.054
I've got the network breathing
down our necks.

05:46.137 --> 05:49.307
We've got this big presentation
where we gotta pitch the season.

05:50.641 --> 05:53.603
[stammering] No, no, don't worry,
it's gonna be fine. I just...

05:54.896 --> 05:58.149
[sighs] I just don't want to be
at home right now. It's too lonely.

05:58.232 --> 05:59.901
Why? Where's Florian?

06:01.027 --> 06:02.987
I wrote him a check that bounced.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.239
Bash! Come on. Not again!

06:05.323 --> 06:06.491
[Bash] Ugh!

06:06.616 --> 06:10.703
I'm good for it as soon as Birdie releases
my bi-monthly allowance in five weeks.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.955
Doesn't bi-monthly mean every two weeks?

06:13.289 --> 06:14.665
That's what I thought, too.

06:16.542 --> 06:19.087
Anyway, we got into this... big... fight,

06:19.170 --> 06:21.839
and he got really mad and he stormed out.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.676
Said I was being completely solipsistic.
[scoffs]

06:26.177 --> 06:27.011
Wow.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.473
I looked it up. It means you think
you're the center of the universe

06:30.556 --> 06:32.100
and you don't care about other people.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.560
Which is completely insane,
because I hate being alone.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.312
You need to talk to him.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.439
How? I don't know where he is.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.942
I keep calling the house,
but nobody answers.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.485
Does he have any other friends

06:42.568 --> 06:45.571
or someone he might be staying with?
Someplace he might be?

06:46.906 --> 06:49.826
Yeah, I mean, he has this one friend
who tends a bar

06:49.909 --> 06:50.952
at this place in Hollywood.

06:51.035 --> 06:53.788
I think Florian goes there sometimes
on his night off.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.499
Well, let's go and see if we can find him.

06:58.668 --> 07:02.130
All right. So I'm some yuppie head
of a shitty network in Anaheim.

07:02.213 --> 07:05.425
I think the sun rises and sets
in my own asshole.

07:05.508 --> 07:06.801
What are you gonna pitch me

07:07.051 --> 07:10.346
to make me feel like less
of a bourgeois douchebag? Debbie.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.057
All right, let's get Ruth in here, though.
She came up with the idea.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.060
No, no, this is a classic soap plot.
I got this. Okay.

07:16.144 --> 07:19.272
In a kidnapping story, the next step is...

07:20.314 --> 07:23.985
for... the... grieving mother
to make a public plea

07:24.068 --> 07:25.153
for her child's safe return.

07:25.236 --> 07:28.322
Then we cut to a remote cabin
in the Montana wilderness

07:28.406 --> 07:32.243
where we see a hermit realize
this is his long-lost wife and child

07:32.326 --> 07:35.121
who he'd forgotten because he was
in a fire, suffered amnesia.

07:35.204 --> 07:38.416
My son, who I gave birth to
after my going away,

07:38.958 --> 07:40.918
falls in love with my long-lost daughter.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.462
I have to stop their wedding.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.881
Uh-oh! She's already pregnant
with their incest baby.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.008
-Oh, wait, wait! Jesus Christ!
-It's raining--

07:47.091 --> 07:51.596
I mean, it's a wrestling show for kids,
not-- not <i>Guiding </i>goddamn<i> Light.</i>

07:52.305 --> 07:53.890
-You're so dismissive.
-Really?

07:53.973 --> 07:56.767
That's the longest I've ever let a woman
who I'm not sleeping with

07:56.893 --> 07:57.977
speak uninterrupted.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.937
You're welcome. It's an honor.

08:00.354 --> 08:01.314
It's not the show.

08:01.397 --> 08:02.482
[Bash] Okay, okay, okay.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.485
We could do a "loser leaves town" match.

08:05.568 --> 08:09.238
Huh? Or-- or-- or a handicap match.
Three against one. That's a classic.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.450
Or a wedding!
People love an in-the-ring wedding!

08:12.533 --> 08:14.535
What? They're all girls.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.746
Who are they gonna marry? Each other?

08:18.331 --> 08:19.373
It's a good point.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.083
[door opens]

08:21.209 --> 08:23.753
[grunts] What do you think?

08:23.878 --> 08:25.880
[upbeat music playing on TV]

08:26.797 --> 08:28.007
My official autograph.

08:28.549 --> 08:32.261
Thought about using the Cyrillic alphabet,
but maybe that's pretentious.

08:32.637 --> 08:35.473
[sighs] I have to do something
to stand out.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.225
They seem to have forgotten all about me.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.103
They're having some big network meeting
about story lines

08:41.187 --> 08:42.146
for the rest of the season?

08:42.230 --> 08:45.399
They didn't even talk to me
about how to play through the baby thing!

08:46.067 --> 08:47.276
[munching loudly]

08:49.070 --> 08:51.155
Wanna talk
about why this is making you so hostile?

08:51.239 --> 08:52.490
I'm not hostile.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.326
I just don't wanna sell my picture
to a bunch of strangers.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.578
You're on a TV show, Sheila.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.081
There's an audience.
This is part of the job.

09:09.715 --> 09:12.301
Wow. That's all yours?

09:12.718 --> 09:14.720
They all have a million questions.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.806
"Where are you from?

09:17.390 --> 09:19.392
Do you have brothers and sisters?

09:19.725 --> 09:21.143
Is that your real name?

09:21.519 --> 09:22.979
What did you do before <i>GLOW?"</i>

09:23.062 --> 09:24.355
They wanna know more about you.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.732
There's a man that dresses up like me.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.318
It's demeaning.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.361
He likes you.

09:30.444 --> 09:33.114
They all<i> </i>like you! You have fans!

09:33.447 --> 09:35.074
What did you think would happen?

09:35.157 --> 09:36.826
I don't like people staring.

09:37.326 --> 09:40.454
Honestly, Sheila, after five years
of walking around Los Angeles

09:40.538 --> 09:42.832
in a fur corset,
you'd think you'd be used to that.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.085
-[telephone rings]
-[sighs]

09:48.588 --> 09:49.422
Hello.

-[woman] <i>Ruth Wilder?</i>
-This is Ruth Wilder.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.135
[woman speaking indistinctly on phone]

09:54.218 --> 09:55.344
Oh, wow!

09:55.761 --> 09:56.721
Really?

09:59.599 --> 10:01.142
I think that should be fine.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.893
Let me just get a pen.

10:03.644 --> 10:06.272
Two pages. Isn't this beautiful?

10:06.772 --> 10:07.773
Mm-hmm.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.902
[laughs] Me too.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.365
Okay. Thank you.

10:16.741 --> 10:17.867
[receiver clicks]

10:17.950 --> 10:19.535
"...my mom does when she gets home..."

10:22.163 --> 10:25.374
That was Tom Grant's secretary
on the line.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.418
The head of the network.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.379
She said he's a big fan of Zoya,

10:30.463 --> 10:33.049
and he wants to meet tomorrow night
for dinner

10:33.132 --> 10:34.592
to talk about my future on show.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.303
Really happy for you.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.263
[exclaims]

10:39.347 --> 10:41.349
[dance music playing]

10:45.811 --> 10:49.315
Shenanigans.
Must be an Irish place like Bennigan's.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.319
[Rhonda] I love this song. Let's dance!

11:34.318 --> 11:35.444
Are you Eric?

11:36.070 --> 11:37.488
I can't hear you, darlin'.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.281
Uh, I'm looking for Eric.

11:39.824 --> 11:40.658
Hey, Eeyore.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.911
You're being paged by Malibu Ken.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.499
What can I do for you?

11:48.582 --> 11:50.543
Uh, I'm looking for a friend of mine.

11:50.626 --> 11:51.460
Florian.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.878
I think you know him.

11:52.962 --> 11:56.215
You must be Bash.
He talks about you a lot.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.509
Well, he's my butler, so... um...

11:59.093 --> 12:00.177
Is he here?

12:00.261 --> 12:04.306
He hasn't been here in a couple of weeks.
Last time, he left his bar tab open.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.267
You gonna take care of it?

12:09.478 --> 12:10.646
I'm just kidding.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.732
What can I get you to drink?

12:15.192 --> 12:16.026
On me.

12:16.777 --> 12:19.488
No, uh, no, thank you.
I mean, I can pay for my own drinks.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.574
And I'm actually not thirsty now.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.117
Or ever.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.544
Florian's not here.

12:33.627 --> 12:34.962
-[Carmen] He's not?
-No, we're going.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.088
Can we please stay?

12:36.172 --> 12:37.465
Rhonda's new friend Bruce said

12:37.548 --> 12:39.467
there's gonna be
a <i>Pink Flamingos </i>look-alike contest,

12:39.550 --> 12:41.427
and I wanna see everybody
dressed as flamingos.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.763
I'm leaving, all right?
So, here, take this.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.974
-It's for a cab home. I'll see you later.
-[Carmen] Wait.

12:48.559 --> 12:51.395
[sighs] We'll find Florian.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.063
It's gonna be okay.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.570
[indistinct chatter]

13:02.782 --> 13:05.367
Ruth Wilder. Here for Tom Grant.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.452
Bungalow two.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.080
Well, I think it's a dinner reservation.
[laughs]

13:10.164 --> 13:12.792
Mr. Grant always takes dinner meetings
in his room.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.085
Just over the bridge,
past the water feature.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.548
Thanks.

Glen!

Oh, my God!

13:57.294 --> 14:00.589
-Glen!
-Wow! What a welcome! Come in!

14:01.131 --> 14:02.508
Uh, Ruth Wilder.

14:02.591 --> 14:04.969
Tom Grant, our fearless leader.

14:05.052 --> 14:08.430
-So nice to meet you, Mr. Grant.
-No, please, call me Tom.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.641
-Who am I? Ed Asner?
-[both laughing]

14:10.724 --> 14:13.644
Yeah, that's him.
<i>The Mary Tyler Moore Show. </i>It's classic.

14:13.727 --> 14:17.064
I'm so sorry for the confusion,
but I just got in from New York,

14:17.147 --> 14:19.608
and I'm too beat to face the restaurant.
Hope you don't mind.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.528
-Course not! I-- I totally understand.
-White Zinfandel?

14:22.611 --> 14:23.529
Yes!

14:23.612 --> 14:25.072
-[Tom] All right, yeah? Okay.
-Mmm!

14:25.155 --> 14:26.615
-[Glen] Yes!
-[laughs]

14:34.331 --> 14:35.374
Are we doing this?

Oh, wow. Both legs out the sweatpants!
What is it, my birthday?

14:46.010 --> 14:49.096
After this long, you should be grateful
I'm still looking at you.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.598
[laughs] Okay.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.770
You don't feel very grateful.

14:56.854 --> 15:00.608
If I got all excited when my woman was not
in the mood, what kind of man would I be?

15:01.317 --> 15:02.276
What's the matter?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.529
Come on, unload on me.
That's what I'm here for.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.993
I'm just figuring out
what I'm doing with my life.

15:11.076 --> 15:14.246
Living in a motel... waiting to see
what Sam's gonna do with me

15:14.330 --> 15:17.041
while Laverne and Shirley crack shit
about my hair.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.753
All right, okay.
All right, I'm calling in reinforcements.

Hello?

Hey, what's up, man? It's Keith.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.682
Look, uh,
I'm feeling a little lonely tonight.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.477
I wonder if you could send over
some Black Magic.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.854
A little voodoo loving.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.025
-All right, thanks.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.203
Yeah!

There she is.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.550
Black Magic. [humming]

16:12.638 --> 16:15.474
-Oh, oh, oh, yes.
-[humming]

16:15.557 --> 16:16.934
Shaking it up now.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.228
-Oh.
-You called?

16:19.311 --> 16:20.187
Mm-hmm.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.731
When the <i>Omaha World Herald </i>calls you
personable

16:22.815 --> 16:24.608
in their review of <i>Talley's Folly,</i>

16:24.692 --> 16:27.403
you know Hollywood must be waiting
with open arms.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.320
So... [laughs]

16:28.404 --> 16:30.990
-Of course!
-I came out, and I waited tables...

16:31.657 --> 16:34.243
-for... a decade.
-[laughing]

16:34.326 --> 16:35.995
I'm glad you think it's funny.

16:36.078 --> 16:39.456
I just find it hard to believe
someone so obviously talented as you

16:39.540 --> 16:41.959
could go so long without work.
Who's your agent?

16:42.376 --> 16:44.962
I don't have one. Which you already know

16:45.045 --> 16:47.381
because what agent
in their right mind would let me anywhere

16:47.464 --> 16:48.674
near that contract we signed?

16:48.757 --> 16:50.926
-[laughs]
-Okay, touché. This one.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.679
-I told you, she's a pistol. Pistol.
-Mm!

-[Tom clears throat]

17:01.270 --> 17:04.398
Well, I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.150
Should we order dinner?

17:06.233 --> 17:07.443
Yes! Dinner!

17:07.943 --> 17:10.362
-Great! Great.
-[clears throat]

17:10.446 --> 17:13.782
I... will... run to the restaurant

17:14.033 --> 17:15.784
grab a couple menus.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.870
I like to know what the specials are.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.204
And I will be...

17:19.580 --> 17:20.706
right back.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.587
[Tom] So... uh, you come out to Hollywood
to be the next Ellen Burstyn.

17:26.670 --> 17:29.673
You're doing, uh, Chekhov
in scene class one day,

17:29.757 --> 17:33.594
the next day you're on a women's
wrestling show on a local network.

17:33.677 --> 17:36.930
Well, it's the best job I've ever had.
[chuckles]

17:37.014 --> 17:39.767
And we've got some really exciting stuff
coming up.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.394
Sam and Bash and Debbie have been working
so hard.

17:42.478 --> 17:45.022
I know, I know. And, officially,
I want to hear all about that.

17:45.105 --> 17:49.902
But I just... I can't imagine that this is
quite what you had in mind for yourself.

17:50.569 --> 17:54.323
Mm, nothing in my life is
what I had in mind for myself.

17:54.865 --> 17:57.868
I've been acting
pretty much my whole life, and...

17:58.118 --> 17:59.161
it's always just...

17:59.745 --> 18:01.789
another audition, another meeting...

18:02.289 --> 18:05.501
Another year of waiting
for someone to give you permission

18:05.584 --> 18:07.461
to do the thing you wanna do.

18:07.544 --> 18:08.378
But...

18:09.004 --> 18:11.632
finally, I'm getting to do something.

18:11.715 --> 18:14.593
And it feels different, you know?

18:15.177 --> 18:16.386
<i>I </i>feel different.

18:16.887 --> 18:17.846
Strong.

18:18.555 --> 18:19.389
In control.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.018
-I could use some of that.
-[both laugh]

18:23.102 --> 18:25.979
Why don't you-- Why don't you  show me
a move or two? [chuckles]

18:28.148 --> 18:30.984
Oh, I...
You know, it just doesn't really...

18:31.443 --> 18:34.488
work if both people aren't...
properly trained.

18:34.571 --> 18:35.447
Oh, no, no, I...

18:35.531 --> 18:37.324
I work out every morning.

18:37.407 --> 18:39.201
So... uh...

18:39.701 --> 18:40.953
-Oh. [chuckles]
-You feel, right?

18:41.286 --> 18:42.996
-Oh. Yeah!

18:43.080 --> 18:46.041
-No flab.
-Impressive. [laughs]

18:47.126 --> 18:48.585
How about a little headlock?

18:50.587 --> 18:52.381
[laughs awkwardly]

18:55.134 --> 18:56.051
All right.

18:56.135 --> 18:56.969
-Um...
-So...

18:57.803 --> 18:59.388
See, uh... you have to...

19:00.264 --> 19:03.058
[in Russian accent] Stupid American.
[chuckles]

19:03.600 --> 19:06.186
Come on. Don't spare me.
I promise I'm not gonna sue you.

-[grunting]

[Tom moaning]

19:16.947 --> 19:17.990
And then...

19:18.323 --> 19:20.993
I go like this, right? [grunts]

19:21.827 --> 19:23.078
Right? [laughs]

-You move too fast for me.
-[chuckles]

19:36.216 --> 19:38.260
You must be tired. I should go.

19:38.343 --> 19:41.305
No, no. What kind of guy would I be
if I let you go back to that roach motel

19:41.388 --> 19:43.307
without a hot meal and a good bath?

19:44.057 --> 19:47.352
I'm gonna go check
on these Jacuzzi jets in the tub.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.397
See if they work as advertised.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.732
What about Glen?

19:51.815 --> 19:53.650
Oh, don't worry about Glen. [chuckles]

19:53.901 --> 19:55.861
He's not coming back. [laughs]

20:39.655 --> 20:41.323
I thought you were the dim sum.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.867
Oh, Gary, it is so comforting
to see a butler.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.452
Is Birdie awake?

20:45.869 --> 20:48.789
She's just left for Squaw Valley
with her very rich,

20:48.872 --> 20:50.582
very old boyfriend, Gil.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.377
She's dating?

20:54.294 --> 20:56.672
Uh, would you like to come in?

20:56.755 --> 20:58.882
[sighs] Yeah. Yeah.

21:07.140 --> 21:10.060
Mmm. These are Howard-Os?

21:10.143 --> 21:11.228
They're spicy.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.564
They've added cayenne pepper
to the seasoning mix

21:14.648 --> 21:16.108
for the Latin market.

21:19.319 --> 21:22.990
-How long have you worked for our family?
-Eighteen years, this December.

21:27.911 --> 21:28.829
Are you all right?

21:30.330 --> 21:31.957
[sighs] Yes. [chuckles]

21:32.165 --> 21:35.210
Yeah, I'm-- I'm just having problems
with my butler. Uh...

21:36.837 --> 21:39.840
It's just a small...
[clears throat] ...cash flow issue.

21:39.923 --> 21:41.633
I get short at the end of the month.

21:41.717 --> 21:44.052
Birdie designed my allowance that way.
You know this.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.762
Anyway, I...

21:46.513 --> 21:50.267
bounced Florian's last check,
and it wasn't the first time,

21:50.350 --> 21:51.518
and...

21:52.227 --> 21:54.604
he got mad and took off.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.606
Anyway, I, uh...

21:56.690 --> 21:58.150
I just need to make good with him

21:58.233 --> 22:02.070
and maybe give him a few months' advance
so that he'll come home. So...

22:02.154 --> 22:03.030
[clears throat]

22:04.031 --> 22:06.116
Florian stopped by a few days ago.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.410
Said he was taking some time off.

22:08.785 --> 22:11.997
He asked Birdie for money
for his travel expenses.

22:12.539 --> 22:14.249
Travel expenses to where?

22:14.333 --> 22:16.960
I have no idea.
I sent him to your mother's study.

22:17.044 --> 22:17.961
He left with a check.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.422
[sighs] Wow.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.303
Do you want me to help you

22:26.386 --> 22:27.262
with your...

22:28.347 --> 22:29.473
bookkeeping?

22:30.891 --> 22:32.559
I would be happy to.

22:41.651 --> 22:44.279
Do you think Birdie would sponsor
my wrestling show?

22:47.657 --> 22:48.909
I will talk with her.

22:50.911 --> 22:54.414

-I don't know where that dim sum is.

23:54.724 --> 23:56.601
[Sam] Okay, I'll go through the boards.

23:56.685 --> 23:59.271
You fill in with stuff
from the story pages. And remember.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.940
Remember, these network guys,
no detail too small,

24:02.023 --> 24:04.359
no question is too stupid. Okay?

24:05.152 --> 24:08.613
Really? You're doing that now?
You didn't have time before right now?

24:08.697 --> 24:10.240
No, Sam-- Fuck. I could not.

24:10.323 --> 24:12.325
I was up half the night working
on this thing,

24:12.409 --> 24:14.578
the other half trying
to get Mark's printer to work.

24:14.661 --> 24:16.204
All right. Maybe you should smoke.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.414
It works for me.

24:18.081 --> 24:20.125
All right, all right, all right. Okay.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.918
Okay. Look, look, look, look!

24:22.210 --> 24:24.546
-It's gonna be great, okay? We're ready.
-Okay.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.506
-[Bash] Whoo!
-[Sam] Where have you been?

24:26.590 --> 24:29.092
Good news! Uh, no, no, no... Blind item.

24:29.176 --> 24:30.510
Okay? Tell me.

24:30.594 --> 24:34.848
What glamorous and nationally-renowned
processed food heiress

24:34.931 --> 24:37.309
might be thinking about,
may be considering

24:37.392 --> 24:40.353
coming on board
as an exclusive <i>GLOW </i>sponsor?

24:40.854 --> 24:42.022
[drums on desk]

24:42.147 --> 24:44.399
Birdie! My mother! Yeah.

24:44.483 --> 24:47.652
I stayed over there last night.
She wasn't there, but Gary, our butler,

24:47.736 --> 24:51.031
thinks that she's very much
not uninterested.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.366
[mutters]

24:54.701 --> 24:56.119
Should we go in one car?

24:56.203 --> 24:59.039
Yes. We should take mine.
It's the most impressive. No offense.

24:59.122 --> 25:00.540
[telephone rings]

25:01.124 --> 25:02.375
Office of Sam Sylvia.

25:02.876 --> 25:05.504
Executive producer Bash Howard speaking.

25:06.087 --> 25:07.923
Yeah, we we're just
on our way out the door.

25:08.798 --> 25:09.633
Uh...

25:09.758 --> 25:10.592
Uh-huh.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.186
[door opens]

25:25.565 --> 25:26.608
[sighs]

25:28.568 --> 25:29.402
Hi.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.655
What are you doing here?

25:31.738 --> 25:34.991
I like to have some time alone
in the space before everyone gets here.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.077
Oh, God. Of course you do.

25:39.412 --> 25:42.165
Aren't you supposed to be
at the big network meeting?

25:42.249 --> 25:45.252
Oh, we had a big network phone call
instead.

25:45.627 --> 25:46.836
They are, um...

25:47.546 --> 25:49.548
moving the show to a new time slot.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.800
At two a.m.<i> </i>[sighs]

25:51.883 --> 25:55.679
[scoffs] But we're a kids' show.
Kids don't watch TV at two a.m.

25:55.762 --> 25:59.391
Nobody watches TV at two a.m., Ruth.
That's the point. They're burying us.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.685
And we're gonna be canceled.

26:04.771 --> 26:05.814
[sighs]

26:08.608 --> 26:11.027
I think this might have something
to do with me.

26:11.111 --> 26:13.154
Jesus Christ,
our show did not get shit-canned

26:13.238 --> 26:14.864
'cause Sam and I wouldn't listen
to your idea

26:14.948 --> 26:17.242
about you wrestling over the fate
of your family's cherry orchard.

26:18.451 --> 26:19.744
It's because, apparently...

26:20.161 --> 26:24.332
the only people watching us are, um...
standing out in the parking lot right now,

26:24.416 --> 26:26.334
leaking pre-cum
into their Sheila costumes.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.044
I had a meeting with Tom Grant.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.631
We were...

26:32.799 --> 26:34.009
in his hotel room.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.051
It was a dinner.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.888
But then it was not dinner.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.349
And Glen was there.

26:42.642 --> 26:45.145
But then...<i> </i>he was not there, and...

26:46.271 --> 26:49.482
he said he wanted to talk about my career,
which he did.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.400
But...

26:51.526 --> 26:54.195
uh, he also wanted to wrestle.

26:55.905 --> 26:57.449
Literally and figuratively.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.203
What did you do?

27:03.496 --> 27:04.998
What do you mean? I left.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.291
You left?

27:06.374 --> 27:09.210
He went into the bathroom,
and I made a run for it.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.922
I can't believe this.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.257
I know. It was terrible.

27:14.341 --> 27:16.343
How could you be so fucking stupid?

27:17.052 --> 27:18.762
-[sighs]
-What are you talking about?

27:18.845 --> 27:20.472
You're in the hotel room
of the head of the network.

27:20.555 --> 27:22.807
He comes on to you, and you run away?

27:23.683 --> 27:25.185
Was I supposed to fuck him?

27:25.268 --> 27:29.272
No! You're supposed to make him think
that you might<i> </i>fuck him.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.983
Or that you desperately want to fuck him,

27:32.067 --> 27:34.861
if only you didn't have a fiancé
or your period

27:34.944 --> 27:37.614
or an extra set of teeth
where your vagina should be.

27:37.697 --> 27:40.283
-I'm not that kind of person.
-What, an actress?

27:40.659 --> 27:42.702
I mean, that is how this business works,
Ruth.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.121
Men try shit, you have to, yeah,
pretend to like it

27:45.205 --> 27:46.790
until you don't have to anymore!

27:46.873 --> 27:48.333
It shouldn't be that way!

27:48.416 --> 27:52.295
No, it shouldn't,
and women should get to direct

27:52.379 --> 27:55.048
and not be washed up
by the time they're 30.

27:55.131 --> 27:58.259
And I should have got to eat a piece
of my own wedding cake

27:58.343 --> 28:00.929
without worrying about how many minutes
of Jane fucking Fonda it was gonna take

28:01.012 --> 28:03.098
to work it off,
but that is the way it is.

28:03.473 --> 28:07.018
You don't make it better by flouncing out
like some fucking Victorian schoolmarm

28:07.102 --> 28:08.895
every time a sleazeball puts his hand
on your knee.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.438
You're taking 20 people down with you!

28:10.522 --> 28:12.982
So, you just let them do
whatever they want?

28:13.400 --> 28:15.819
Not exactly a guiding feminist principle.

28:15.902 --> 28:18.488
Feminism has principles,
life has compromises.

28:19.155 --> 28:20.782
Congratulations, Gloria Steinem.

28:21.366 --> 28:24.285
The one time you keep your legs shut,
we all get fucked!

28:30.166 --> 28:31.292
[indistinct chatter]

28:31.376 --> 28:33.128
-Ooh, that felt great!
-You've got detention.

28:33.294 --> 28:35.088
-[man] Oh, thanks.
-Enjoy it!

28:35.171 --> 28:37.424
-[woman] A picture?
-[Dawn and Stacey] Yeah!

28:37.507 --> 28:40.635
Just be careful
with my massive chemical gun here.

28:41.553 --> 28:42.762
-Oh, thank you so much.
-Yeah!

28:42.846 --> 28:45.181
Did you see that?
Machu Picchu put me in a headlock!

28:56.985 --> 28:59.028
[chattering]

29:02.699 --> 29:04.200
[Jenny] Oh, sure.

29:07.370 --> 29:10.832
-[Sheila] Nice to see you again.
-[man] You're the best.
