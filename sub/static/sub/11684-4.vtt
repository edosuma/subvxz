WEBVTT

00:00.371 --> 00:01.788
My name
is Michael Westen.

00:02.440 --> 00:04.423
I used to be a spy until...

00:04.475 --> 00:05.591
We got a burn notice
on you.

00:05.643 --> 00:07.560
You're blacklisted.

00:07.611 --> 00:09.896
When you're burned,
you've got nothing.

00:09.947 --> 00:12.198
No cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:12.266 --> 00:14.534
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:14.601 --> 00:16.953
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:17.037 --> 00:19.289
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:19.373 --> 00:21.458
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you...

00:22.993 --> 00:23.943
A trigger-happy girlfriend...

00:23.994 --> 00:25.378
Should we shoot them?

00:25.445 --> 00:27.380
An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...

00:27.447 --> 00:29.966
You know spies--
bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.050 --> 00:31.384
Family too...

00:31.451 --> 00:32.284
Hey, is that your mom again?

00:32.336 --> 00:33.452
If you're desperate.

00:33.504 --> 00:34.784
Someone needs your help,
Michael.

00:34.805 --> 00:37.557
And a down-and-out spy
you met along the way.

00:37.624 --> 00:39.125
That's how we do it,
people.

00:39.176 --> 00:41.845
Bottom line,
as long as you're burned,

00:41.929 --> 00:43.646
you're not going anywhere.

00:45.434 --> 00:46.767
It's a deep cover job.

00:46.819 --> 00:48.352
Going after the leader
of a terrorist network

00:48.437 --> 00:51.155
based in the Dominican Republic,
Randall Burke.

00:51.240 --> 00:52.657
Those satellite uplinks
you told me

00:52.741 --> 00:53.701
that Burke was stealing?

00:53.775 --> 00:55.243
Guess who he's selling 'em to?

00:55.310 --> 00:57.311
Rafael Serano,
international terrorist.

00:57.362 --> 01:02.149
- So how do you want to do it?
- I don't want your money.

01:02.201 --> 01:03.317
I just want you.

01:03.368 --> 01:05.419
You have information
that's valuable

01:05.486 --> 01:06.487
to people I work for.

01:06.538 --> 01:07.672
Go!

01:07.756 --> 01:09.457
I just found out
you have a boss.

01:09.508 --> 01:10.341
Burke, you're part
of an organization.

01:10.425 --> 01:11.592
Am I part of it?

01:11.660 --> 01:13.544
Or am I some tool you use
and throw away?

01:13.629 --> 01:16.830
All will be revealed
in time.

01:23.105 --> 01:24.939
Are you in place?

01:25.006 --> 01:26.474
Yeah.
Are we a go?

01:26.525 --> 01:27.841
We're a go.

01:27.893 --> 01:31.145
I know you don't like
this operation, Michael.

01:31.196 --> 01:34.699
Just remember, Serano
hasn't given us much choice.

01:34.783 --> 01:36.350
Burke, we can break him.

01:36.401 --> 01:38.569
Just keep interrogating him.
It'll take time.

01:38.654 --> 01:40.404
Time we don't have.

01:40.489 --> 01:41.906
This has to happen now.

01:41.990 --> 01:44.709
Are you ready?

01:44.793 --> 01:47.745
Are you ready, Michael?

01:47.829 --> 01:49.664
I'll do what I have to do.

01:49.715 --> 01:51.666
Good.
Keep your radio live.

01:51.717 --> 01:54.502
Remember, I'm counting on you.
We all are.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:04.763 --> 02:06.714
Hello, Serano.

02:06.765 --> 02:09.901
Gonna do this again?

02:09.985 --> 02:12.436
I told you,
I have nothing to say.

02:12.521 --> 02:15.273
The same as yesterday
and the days before

02:15.357 --> 02:16.724
and every time you've been
in this room!

02:16.775 --> 02:19.327
Yeah, well...

02:19.394 --> 02:20.611
You can make this all stop

02:20.696 --> 02:23.531
just by answering
my one question.

02:23.582 --> 02:25.833
Six months ago,
you're in Haiti

02:25.900 --> 02:27.418
doing an arms deal
with a Turkish national.

02:27.502 --> 02:28.902
You're wasting your time!

02:28.954 --> 02:32.173
You receive information
about a woman in the area

02:32.240 --> 02:34.175
that's wanted
by Russian intelligence.

02:34.242 --> 02:36.260
And you tell the Russians--
her location. Yes!

02:36.345 --> 02:40.181
In exchange
for $2 million. Yes!

02:40.248 --> 02:42.600
Tell me where
they're holding her.

02:46.555 --> 02:49.557
Why don't you kill me now?

02:49.608 --> 02:52.276
Huh? I'm not
gonna tell you anything.

02:52.361 --> 02:55.262
The same as every other day.

02:59.484 --> 03:02.236
I think today might be
a little different.

03:08.210 --> 03:10.778
Just keep watching.

03:32.401 --> 03:34.968
When you work undercover,

03:35.020 --> 03:37.154
the first question
you have to ask yourself

03:37.239 --> 03:40.941
is how far you're willing to go
to accomplish the mission.

03:40.993 --> 03:42.443
Oh, no, no.

03:42.494 --> 03:44.311
Oh, no. No, no.

03:44.363 --> 03:45.997
<i>Si, si-si, si-si, si.</i>

03:46.081 --> 03:49.033
That's your daughter.

03:49.117 --> 03:52.319
The trick is to make
the people you're working for

03:52.371 --> 03:54.705
believe that those lines
don't exist,

03:54.790 --> 03:57.658
that you're willing to do
absolutely anything for them

03:57.709 --> 03:59.827
no matter how horrible.

03:59.878 --> 04:01.962
Tell me what I want to know.

04:02.014 --> 04:03.497
You have no idea

04:03.548 --> 04:05.716
what these Russians will do
if I say anything.

04:05.801 --> 04:08.185
Your biggest problem
isn't the Russians right now.

04:08.270 --> 04:09.270
It's me.

04:09.337 --> 04:10.855
Please, no.

04:10.939 --> 04:12.390
Please.

04:12.474 --> 04:14.058
I'm gonna make a call
to the gentleman

04:14.142 --> 04:15.559
in your daughter's bedroom.

04:15.644 --> 04:17.084
You're gonna get
to watch the results

04:17.112 --> 04:19.863
of that call
on that screen.

04:19.947 --> 04:21.515
The bitch is in Cuba!

04:21.565 --> 04:23.016
Cuba!

04:23.068 --> 04:26.120
Some black site off Havana!

04:26.187 --> 04:28.489
It's a factory down
by the south port.

04:28.540 --> 04:32.209
That's all I know!
I swear!

04:34.413 --> 04:37.915
It's okay.

04:37.999 --> 04:40.718
It's okay, amigo.

04:42.220 --> 04:43.637
You made the right choice.

04:49.261 --> 04:50.928
Hey.

04:53.315 --> 04:55.232
We're not gonna hurt
your daughter.

04:55.317 --> 04:57.151
No, she'll be okay.

04:57.218 --> 04:59.270
These Russians...

04:59.354 --> 05:01.105
They'll go after my family.

05:01.189 --> 05:04.992
You're right.

05:06.695 --> 05:08.779
The Russians are gonna want
to punish you,

05:08.864 --> 05:11.615
but only as long
as you're still alive.

05:23.678 --> 05:26.514
You got a cigarette?

05:45.817 --> 05:48.369
The only way to get through
a mission like that

05:48.436 --> 05:51.572
is to remind yourself
that to stop a monster,

05:51.623 --> 05:53.824
sometimes you have to pretend
to be one.

06:04.283 --> 06:08.283

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

06:13.286 --> 06:15.704
This mission
is getting out of control.

06:15.789 --> 06:18.757
Strong, you need to talk
to your people at the CIA,

06:18.825 --> 06:20.993
make them understand
I can't do this.

06:21.044 --> 06:23.345
Michael, calm down.
I know you're upset.

06:23.430 --> 06:25.180
Upset?

06:25.265 --> 06:27.099
Burke almost had me
kill a child.

06:27.166 --> 06:28.968
But you didn't.

06:29.019 --> 06:31.353
This time.

06:31.438 --> 06:34.890
Now he wants me to pull Sam
and Jesse in for a job in Cuba,

06:34.975 --> 06:36.525
and I can't do it.

06:36.610 --> 06:38.394
You can't?
You have to.

06:38.478 --> 06:40.518
You know as well as I do
that it's not just your ass

06:40.530 --> 06:42.781
on the line
if this mission goes south.

06:42.849 --> 06:47.319
Michael,
do you understand?

06:47.370 --> 06:48.904
- Yeah.
- Good.

07:17.233 --> 07:18.901
Thanks for coming, Sam.

07:18.985 --> 07:20.826
Yeah, not loving
these last-minute trips, Mike.

07:20.854 --> 07:22.521
Two-hour notice
to get to Cuba,

07:22.572 --> 07:24.222
to bust somebody
out of a Russian black site?

07:24.274 --> 07:25.574
That's the plan.

07:25.659 --> 07:26.725
And Burke won't say
who we're breaking out?

07:26.776 --> 07:28.110
It's a woman.
That's all I know.

07:28.194 --> 07:29.078
Well, she must be
pretty damn important.

07:29.162 --> 07:30.395
In case you hadn't noticed,

07:30.447 --> 07:31.563
we're not exactly
on friendly soil.

07:31.615 --> 07:33.231
We get caught here,
we're staring

07:33.283 --> 07:34.566
at the wrong end
of a firing squad.

07:34.618 --> 07:36.085
Look, Mike, Jesse and I
will back you up,

07:36.169 --> 07:37.569
but tell me
there's an endgame here.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.171
When do we get to take
the son of a bitch down?

07:39.238 --> 07:41.457
As soon as I find out
who Burke is working for.

07:41.541 --> 07:43.241
This is much bigger
than just one guy, Sam.

07:43.293 --> 07:44.576
Great. Let me guess.

07:44.628 --> 07:46.095
Strong and the CIA brass

07:46.179 --> 07:47.513
want you to find out
how much bigger?

07:47.580 --> 07:49.465
This doesn't end until I do.

07:49.549 --> 07:52.250
Burke went to a lot of trouble
to track this woman down.

07:52.302 --> 07:54.186
She could be the key
to what his group is up to.

07:54.253 --> 07:55.453
Guess we better
get at it then.

08:06.116 --> 08:07.700
So the Russians are hiding
their black sites

08:07.767 --> 08:09.568
in refrigerator
repair shops now?

08:09.619 --> 08:12.104
It's been closed down
for a few years.

08:12.155 --> 08:14.123
They moved in,
put guards on the roof,

08:14.207 --> 08:16.625
and turned it
into a secret prison.

08:16.710 --> 08:18.210
What can you say
about the security situation?

08:18.277 --> 08:19.294
Not much.

08:19.379 --> 08:20.779
There's only one way in
or out.

08:20.830 --> 08:22.047
At any given time,

08:22.115 --> 08:23.549
there's a half-dozen guards
up on the roof.

08:23.616 --> 08:25.334
Steel-reinforced front doors
and a whole lotta cameras.

08:25.418 --> 08:27.836
Yeah, no kidding.
And the target?

08:27.921 --> 08:28.971
Sonya Lebedenko.

08:29.055 --> 08:30.055
She's gonna be
in a holding cell

08:30.123 --> 08:31.223
somewhere in that building.

08:31.290 --> 08:32.758
Who is she?

08:32.808 --> 08:35.010
She's a girl
in a holding cell

08:35.095 --> 08:36.294
somewhere
inside the building.

08:36.346 --> 08:37.294
That's all you need to know.

08:37.347 --> 08:39.014
All righty then.

08:39.099 --> 08:42.400
Do we have any intel
on what lies between her cell

08:42.467 --> 08:44.153
and the front door and how
we're gonna get past it?

08:44.236 --> 08:45.771
That's what you're here
to figure out, Jesse.

08:45.822 --> 08:46.689
Appreciate
the vote of confidence,

08:46.773 --> 08:47.740
but just look at the place.

08:47.807 --> 08:49.141
Even if we make it in there,

08:49.192 --> 08:51.110
I don't see a way
to get this Sonya back out.

08:51.161 --> 08:51.994
You know,
that's a good point, Sam.

08:52.078 --> 08:53.445
But here's the deal.

08:53.496 --> 08:55.480
Either you figure out a plan
to get her out quick

08:55.532 --> 08:56.949
or I'll find someone else
who will.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.819
Don't worry.
We'll come up with something.

09:03.373 --> 09:05.591
Okay, Mike, it's official.
You've gone crazy.

09:05.658 --> 09:07.292
- I can't have Burke...
- This is impossible!

09:07.343 --> 09:09.327
Bringing in other people
in on this.

09:09.379 --> 09:11.680
My entire mission at the CIA
is riding on this!

09:11.765 --> 09:12.965
Well,
it's not gonna mean much

09:13.016 --> 09:14.332
if we all get pumped
full of lead, Mike.

09:14.384 --> 09:15.718
And there's a good chance
of that happening

09:15.802 --> 09:17.082
if we go in there
guns a-blazing.

09:17.137 --> 09:19.304
You know I'm right.

09:19.355 --> 09:22.007
Well, maybe...
We don't go in.

09:22.058 --> 09:23.726
Maybe we get them
to bring her out.

09:23.810 --> 09:25.778
What are you talking about?

09:25.845 --> 09:27.029
If I can
convince the Russians

09:27.113 --> 09:30.232
that the CIA
is about to raid their site,

09:30.316 --> 09:31.784
they'll evacuate with Sonya.

09:31.851 --> 09:33.131
It'll be a lot easier
to grab her

09:33.153 --> 09:34.536
if they're on the move.

09:34.621 --> 09:35.454
Well, what makes you think
they're gonna bite

09:35.521 --> 09:36.822
on your approach?

09:36.873 --> 09:38.857
I just spent nine months
in a Dominican hellhole

09:38.908 --> 09:41.160
convincing the world
the CIA hates me.

09:41.211 --> 09:43.028
It's not a stretch
to say I'd turn on them.

09:43.079 --> 09:45.297
Mike, that's
all well and good,

09:45.364 --> 09:47.132
but these are the Russians
that we're talking about.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.467
Last I checked,
they hate you.

09:48.534 --> 09:50.719
Besides, you won't even
be able to explain

09:50.804 --> 09:53.038
why you know where
their black site is.

09:53.089 --> 09:54.706
I'll say I have a source
I can't reveal.

09:54.758 --> 09:55.724
And when they start
to torture you,

09:55.809 --> 09:56.930
what will you
tell them then?

09:57.010 --> 09:57.976
I don't know
what else to do, Sam!

09:58.044 --> 10:00.312
Guys! Guys!
I have an idea.

10:00.379 --> 10:02.014
Back in my CIFA days,
I knew a guy

10:02.065 --> 10:04.266
at the Russian consulate
in Miami--Ivan Gorev.

10:04.350 --> 10:06.051
He's the G.R.U.'s
deputy chief.

10:06.102 --> 10:07.886
He used to harass dissidents,
steal corporate secrets,

10:07.937 --> 10:09.488
stuff like that.
Yeah, but so what?

10:09.555 --> 10:11.356
How does a guy 200 miles away
solve our problem?

10:11.407 --> 10:13.575
We get someone in Miami
to grab this guy,

10:13.660 --> 10:14.693
make it look like
he's spying for the U.S.

10:14.744 --> 10:15.994
Then Mike goes in,

10:16.062 --> 10:18.063
tells 'em about a traitor
in their ranks.

10:18.114 --> 10:21.083
They might buy the story.

10:21.167 --> 10:23.068
That could work.

10:23.119 --> 10:25.754
Now this, uh,
someone in Miami...

10:25.839 --> 10:27.790
Any ideas?

10:31.094 --> 10:32.961
I'll call Fi.

10:41.688 --> 10:43.305
- Hello?
- It's me.

10:43.389 --> 10:46.975
Well, I assume you're
not calling to catch up.

10:47.060 --> 10:49.928
Fi, I need your help.

10:53.283 --> 10:55.367
Michael,
I have spent the last year

10:55.434 --> 10:57.269
trying to put my life
back together.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.787
What was left of it.

10:58.872 --> 11:00.656
Now things are good.

11:00.740 --> 11:03.775
I-I can't drop everything
when you call.

11:03.827 --> 11:05.460
Not anymore.

11:05.545 --> 11:07.546
You're right.
And I'm sorry I--

11:07.613 --> 11:09.998
- Michael, look--
- Let me finish, please.

11:10.083 --> 11:13.302
I'm sorry I made a promise
that things were gonna change

11:13.386 --> 11:14.837
and then I broke
that promise.

11:14.921 --> 11:17.956
You deserve better.

11:21.794 --> 11:24.629
I'm glad you have that now.

11:31.521 --> 11:33.021
What do you need?

11:42.866 --> 11:45.951
It shouldn't be too long.
The consulate opens at 9:00.

11:46.002 --> 11:48.587
Don't worry about me.
It's my first kidnapping.

11:49.873 --> 11:52.657
I'm not exactly
in a hurry to start.

11:52.709 --> 11:54.826
Well, just follow my lead.

11:54.878 --> 11:57.596
These things are usually
much easier than they sound.

11:57.663 --> 12:00.432
Nice try, honey.

12:00.499 --> 12:02.434
You know
I don't mind lending a hand

12:02.501 --> 12:04.102
when it comes to these jobs.

12:04.170 --> 12:08.023
But wouldn't Carlos have been
a better choice?

12:08.107 --> 12:10.842
Well, I couldn't tell him
what I was doing.

12:13.846 --> 12:15.530
You know,
it's none of my business,

12:15.615 --> 12:18.784
but keeping secrets
is not really great

12:18.851 --> 12:20.736
for a relationship.

12:20.820 --> 12:23.038
Especially a secret like this.

12:23.122 --> 12:26.191
Talking to him about it
would've been too hard.

12:26.242 --> 12:27.292
Fi, why are you
doing this?

12:27.360 --> 12:28.961
I wish I knew.

12:31.831 --> 12:33.415
There's Ivan.

12:33.499 --> 12:35.384
Doesn't look like
much of a spy, does he?

12:35.468 --> 12:36.585
Well, he's more
of a pencil-pusher.

12:36.669 --> 12:37.803
But from what I hear,

12:37.870 --> 12:38.921
he's done his fair share
of damage.

12:39.005 --> 12:40.973
You stay sharp.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.592
Uh, sir?
Hi.

12:43.676 --> 12:46.044
You know, my mother and I
are delivering some boxes

12:46.095 --> 12:47.763
to a friend of hers,
and she's not home.

12:47.847 --> 12:49.431
Could you help us?

12:49.515 --> 12:51.266
No, sorry.
I'm late for work.

12:51.351 --> 12:53.051
It'll just take
a couple seconds.

12:53.102 --> 12:54.152
Yes, but I have
a very busy day.

12:54.220 --> 12:56.021
I can't.

12:56.072 --> 12:59.491
Well, then I suggest
you make time.

13:02.111 --> 13:04.780
When you're planning
to smuggle a listening device

13:04.864 --> 13:07.282
into a facility where
you know you'll be searched,

13:07.367 --> 13:11.569
choosing where to hide it
can be a life-or-death decision.

13:13.122 --> 13:15.573
Not only
do you want to conceal it

13:15.625 --> 13:17.793
in a place where no one
will think to look...

13:17.877 --> 13:19.962
Okay, brother, you ready?

13:20.046 --> 13:22.681
But also in a place
no one will <i>want</i> to look.

13:35.528 --> 13:37.396
Okay, that looks
sufficiently gross.

13:37.447 --> 13:39.982
Okay, Burke,
we're ready over here.

13:40.066 --> 13:41.483
Let's see if it works.

13:41.567 --> 13:43.035
Transmitting.

13:43.102 --> 13:44.102
Transmitting.

13:44.120 --> 13:47.605
Loud and clear.

13:47.657 --> 13:48.490
All right,
we're on the move.

13:48.574 --> 13:50.709
Let's get this place set up.

13:50.776 --> 13:52.794
Okay, Mikey.

13:52.879 --> 13:54.663
Go make some new friends.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.985
Open the door!

14:32.318 --> 14:35.370
Michael Westen.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.518
When an undercover cop
wears a wire,

14:59.602 --> 15:03.171
it's often more for safety
than for intelligence gathering.

15:03.222 --> 15:04.556
If the Op goes bad,

15:04.640 --> 15:07.058
his support team
can pull him out.

15:07.143 --> 15:09.177
For a spy wearing a wire,

15:09.228 --> 15:11.112
those priorities
are reversed.

15:11.180 --> 15:12.847
What matters
is the intelligence.

15:12.899 --> 15:15.066
If the Op goes bad,

15:15.151 --> 15:16.902
your support team
just listens to you die.

15:25.211 --> 15:26.211
It's urgent!

15:26.295 --> 15:28.196
This is urgent!

15:33.669 --> 15:36.221
Michael Westen, I must say!

15:36.305 --> 15:39.674
Is very big honor.

15:41.477 --> 15:45.230
It's not every day that
such a famous spy shows up,

15:45.314 --> 15:47.682
gives me a chance
to practice my English.

15:47.733 --> 15:51.570
I am Vladimir Duboff,
G.R.U.

15:51.654 --> 15:53.855
Tell me,
what can I do for you?

15:53.906 --> 15:54.906
Glad you asked.

15:54.991 --> 15:57.275
I need protection.

15:57.360 --> 16:00.529
Protection?

16:00.580 --> 16:02.697
You came here
for protection?

16:02.748 --> 16:05.534
Maybe you're not as clever
as they say.

16:05.585 --> 16:07.002
My men are already competing

16:07.069 --> 16:08.670
for honor of putting bullet
in your head.

16:08.671 --> 16:10.372
Why would I protect you?

16:10.423 --> 16:12.457
I'm not on the greatest terms
with the CIA.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.009
Maybe you've heard?

16:14.076 --> 16:16.177
Yeah, they say
you had a disagreement

16:16.245 --> 16:18.079
with a senior officer.

16:18.130 --> 16:19.747
And shot him.

16:19.799 --> 16:21.416
Yeah, and they've
been hunting me ever since.

16:21.467 --> 16:24.853
Unfortunately,
I got spotted by a CIA team

16:24.920 --> 16:26.688
in the middle
of Havana yesterday.

16:26.755 --> 16:29.057
Caught a bullet fragment
trying to get away.

16:29.108 --> 16:32.143
A CIA team...
In Havana?

16:32.228 --> 16:33.228
Yeah, I couldn't
believe it either.

16:33.279 --> 16:35.146
So I looked into it,
find out

16:35.231 --> 16:36.314
they're going to raid
this place.

16:36.399 --> 16:40.435
So, old enemy,
meet new friend.

16:40.486 --> 16:43.104
I help you, you help me?

16:45.041 --> 16:47.792
The CIA attack here?

16:47.877 --> 16:50.295
Mm, no, no.

16:50.379 --> 16:52.080
This is impossible.

16:52.131 --> 16:53.965
It's not just possible,
it is happening.

16:54.050 --> 16:55.584
I have a source who told me

16:55.635 --> 16:57.469
they're after some prisoner
you have here.

16:57.553 --> 16:59.954
A girl. Sonya?

17:00.006 --> 17:01.306
Does that ring a bell?

17:01.390 --> 17:03.258
I'll take that as a yes.

17:03.309 --> 17:05.426
Listen to me.
Vladimir, I can help you.

17:05.478 --> 17:06.845
You get this girl,

17:06.929 --> 17:08.888
we slip out of here quietly,
just the three of us,

17:08.931 --> 17:12.233
and my source
can get us a safe route.

17:13.402 --> 17:15.185
Enough!
This is a lie!

17:15.271 --> 17:16.688
This is impossible.

17:16.771 --> 17:20.075
There is no way the CIA
knows about these things!

17:20.142 --> 17:21.943
Well, then explain
how I walked up

17:21.993 --> 17:24.412
and knocked on
your front door!

17:24.480 --> 17:25.646
You have a leak.

17:25.698 --> 17:28.500
A G.R.U. guy
at the consulate in Miami.

17:28.584 --> 17:30.001
Check it out if you want.

17:30.086 --> 17:33.988
I'm telling you the truth.

17:34.040 --> 17:37.175
We will find out
what is the truth.

17:39.045 --> 17:41.596
The trick to making someone
look like a spy

17:41.664 --> 17:43.515
is to strike
just the right balance

17:43.599 --> 17:46.267
between tradecraft that's
good enough to be convincing

17:46.335 --> 17:49.220
but bad enough
to be detected.

17:49.305 --> 17:52.607
One of the easiest techniques
makes use of cell phone GPS.

17:52.675 --> 17:54.859
If you know the phone
is monitored

17:54.944 --> 17:58.363
you can lay down a digital trail
all over town,

17:58.447 --> 18:00.181
and it will lead straight
to your target.

18:00.232 --> 18:03.234
You really think the Russians
are tracking this thing?

18:03.319 --> 18:05.353
Well, if they haven't yet,
they will be.

18:05.404 --> 18:06.871
Which is why
I need to make it look

18:06.956 --> 18:08.790
like Ivan left this bag
of documents behind

18:08.857 --> 18:11.025
for his contact.

18:11.077 --> 18:12.210
I'm gonna dump it
in that trash can over there.

18:13.963 --> 18:17.465
If he tries anything,
shoot him.

18:22.304 --> 18:24.923
Water, please.

18:25.007 --> 18:26.174
Water.

18:26.225 --> 18:28.059
- Water?
- Yeah.

18:31.347 --> 18:34.349
You stay quiet,
you understand?

18:40.940 --> 18:42.273
Why are you doing this?

18:42.358 --> 18:44.943
If G.R.U. believes
I am traitor,

18:45.027 --> 18:47.078
they will kill me.

18:47.163 --> 18:49.063
I'm sorry.

18:49.115 --> 18:51.065
We're helping someone.

18:53.035 --> 18:55.537
But there must be
another way.

18:55.588 --> 18:57.872
Please.
I have connections.

18:57.923 --> 18:59.741
Whatever it is you need--
I'm sorry.

18:59.792 --> 19:02.910
I don't believe
there is another way.

19:17.092 --> 19:19.594
Damn it!

19:35.745 --> 19:37.445
I hope you've had
your fill of water today,

19:37.496 --> 19:41.499
'cause it's the last
you're gonna get.

19:59.635 --> 20:02.520
That's right.

20:05.441 --> 20:07.442
I do not like
to do this to you.

20:07.493 --> 20:10.411
Tell me why it is
you're really here,

20:10.479 --> 20:12.781
who sent you,
and we stop.

20:12.832 --> 20:14.749
I don't like you
doing this to me either!

20:14.817 --> 20:15.867
And I told you!

20:15.951 --> 20:18.253
The CIA,

20:18.320 --> 20:19.287
they're going to raid
this place.

20:19.338 --> 20:20.622
That is a lie.

20:20.673 --> 20:23.341
This is the most secret
Russian facility

20:23.425 --> 20:24.709
in the Republic of Cuba!

20:24.794 --> 20:26.010
The CIA does not--

20:26.095 --> 20:28.596
I told you!
There's a source in Miami!

20:28.664 --> 20:31.883
Do you think we tell someone
in Miami consulate

20:31.967 --> 20:33.434
about this place?

20:33.502 --> 20:34.803
No!

20:34.854 --> 20:36.638
Whatever game it is
you are playing,

20:36.689 --> 20:37.839
it is time to stop.

20:37.890 --> 20:40.525
Time to tell me the truth!

20:40.609 --> 20:43.695
I am telling the truth,
I swear.

20:43.779 --> 20:46.531
You have to get your prisoner
out of here.

20:58.327 --> 21:00.712
Bad news from Miami?

21:00.796 --> 21:03.364
I do not understand it.

21:03.415 --> 21:04.632
A G.R.U. agent
went missing,

21:04.700 --> 21:06.501
leaving behind documents
with information

21:06.552 --> 21:08.369
about this location.

21:08.420 --> 21:09.704
It doesn't make sense!

21:09.755 --> 21:11.973
This G.R.U. agent,
he's never been here.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.641
He's nothing, he's nobody!

21:13.709 --> 21:15.560
That's what a good agent will
make you think, wouldn't he?

21:15.644 --> 21:18.680
He made calls to a hotel
near the revolution Plaza.

21:18.731 --> 21:20.882
That's very close to where
the CIA took a shot at me.

21:20.933 --> 21:23.518
If you hurry, you can send
a team over there,

21:23.569 --> 21:25.270
you might catch
a bunch of commandos

21:25.354 --> 21:26.721
ordering room service.

21:26.772 --> 21:29.190
And when you're done,
maybe you can untie me

21:29.241 --> 21:30.525
and we get
the hell out of here!

21:40.169 --> 21:41.703
They took the bait.

21:41.754 --> 21:43.755
You've got a car full of
G.R.U. agents headed your way.

21:43.839 --> 21:45.673
Ready?

21:45.741 --> 21:48.409
As ready as we can be
for a car full of G.R.U. agents.

21:48.460 --> 21:49.510
Just make it
look convincing.

21:49.578 --> 21:50.912
Yeah, we're on it, man.

21:50.963 --> 21:52.380
The place looks like
an abandoned CIA headquarters.

21:52.431 --> 21:54.098
Don't mess this up.

21:54.183 --> 21:56.083
We're not gonna get
another chance.

21:58.103 --> 21:59.520
You're welcome, man.

21:59.588 --> 22:01.806
He says the G.R.U.'S
rolling this way.

22:01.891 --> 22:04.392
Figure we got about 15 minutes
if they don't hit traffic.

22:04.443 --> 22:06.027
Okay, let's get cracking.

22:06.094 --> 22:08.947
Standard protocol
for leaving a covert base

22:09.031 --> 22:11.783
is to destroy anything
of intelligence value.

22:11.867 --> 22:13.284
Computer hard drives
are smashed.

22:13.369 --> 22:15.370
Documents are shredded
or burned.

22:15.437 --> 22:18.039
If you need
to convince someone

22:18.106 --> 22:20.408
they found an abandoned
CIA operations center,

22:20.459 --> 22:23.878
you've got to make
a serious mess.

22:23.946 --> 22:25.713
But, of course...

22:25.781 --> 22:26.998
None of that
will do much good

22:27.082 --> 22:28.917
if you get caught
making that mess.

22:30.636 --> 22:31.669
Oh, crap.

22:31.754 --> 22:33.304
Sam, we got trouble.
What?

22:33.389 --> 22:36.140
You said the Russian bastards
wouldn't be here for 15 minutes.

22:36.225 --> 22:38.676
It's not the Russian bastards,
it's the Cuban bastards.

22:38.761 --> 22:39.928
G.R.U. must have called the cops
for backup.

22:39.979 --> 22:41.963
- Well, there goes our way out.
- No, duh.

22:42.014 --> 22:42.897
We gotta find another way
out of this place.

22:42.965 --> 22:43.925
Well, you got any ideas?

22:43.966 --> 22:45.633
'Cause all I see is a door

22:45.684 --> 22:47.402
that leads to a very long stay
in a Cuban prison

22:47.469 --> 22:48.937
or a window that leads

22:48.988 --> 22:50.438
to a very long drop
to the concrete.

22:50.489 --> 22:51.472
Maybe not.

22:51.523 --> 22:53.775
Check it out.

22:55.861 --> 22:57.078
Oh, I don't like this idea.

22:57.145 --> 22:58.329
You got a better one?

22:58.414 --> 22:59.530
Just 'cause
I got nothing better,

22:59.615 --> 23:00.782
doesn't make your idea good.
Sam.

23:50.238 --> 23:51.956
Did your men
find the team?

23:52.023 --> 23:54.291
They were at the hotel,
but they escaped.

23:54.359 --> 23:56.660
My men are gathering
whatever intelligence is left

23:56.711 --> 23:57.711
from the site now.

23:57.796 --> 23:58.862
They will bring it here,

23:58.913 --> 24:00.530
and you will help us
to evaluate.

24:00.582 --> 24:02.416
You want to go over
documents?

24:02.500 --> 24:03.917
Vladimir,
we need to leave now.

24:04.002 --> 24:05.552
I increased the number
of the guards.

24:05.637 --> 24:06.587
We are safe.

24:06.671 --> 24:07.871
Safe.
Is that a joke?

24:07.922 --> 24:09.306
The is the least safe place
in all of Cuba.

24:09.374 --> 24:13.394
Somewhere in here is a traitor,
maybe more than one.

24:13.478 --> 24:14.895
Traitor?
There is no traitor.

24:14.980 --> 24:16.313
How many CIA documents
were shredded?

24:16.381 --> 24:17.514
How many computers
were destroyed?

24:17.565 --> 24:18.882
All of them!

24:18.933 --> 24:20.050
The CIA team must have seen
my men drive up--

24:20.101 --> 24:21.151
Vladimir, think.

24:21.219 --> 24:22.653
If they destroyed everything,

24:22.720 --> 24:24.822
they must have started
<i>before</i> your men arrived.

24:24.889 --> 24:27.274
How could they have done that
if they weren't tipped off?

24:27.359 --> 24:29.410
All of the men here...

24:29.494 --> 24:31.779
were checked personally
by me.

24:31.863 --> 24:34.198
Then I suggest
you check them again,

24:34.249 --> 24:37.785
because somebody in here
is selling you out.

24:44.342 --> 24:46.343
I think I tore a ligament
or something

24:46.411 --> 24:48.045
on top of that stupid bus.

24:48.096 --> 24:49.346
God, will you stop
complaining about that?

24:49.414 --> 24:50.431
Not complaining,
it just hurts.

24:50.515 --> 24:52.132
Right, that's called
complaining.

24:52.217 --> 24:53.717
That's what complaining is.

24:53.768 --> 24:55.085
Tell you what,
next time we'll wait around

24:55.136 --> 24:57.587
for a bus with a...
giant pillow on top of it.

24:57.639 --> 24:58.972
How does that sound?
Yeah, very funny.

24:59.057 --> 25:00.474
You're not the one
walking halfway across Havana

25:00.558 --> 25:02.393
on a busted ankle.

25:02.444 --> 25:04.278
Hang on.

25:04.362 --> 25:05.595
Oh, here we go.

25:05.647 --> 25:06.864
Yeah?

25:06.931 --> 25:08.315
Where are you?

25:08.400 --> 25:10.317
We're in the old town area
taking side streets.

25:10.402 --> 25:11.935
- Look, we should be to you--
- No, check that.

25:11.986 --> 25:13.737
Vladimir still isn't sold.

25:13.788 --> 25:16.707
Michael just told him he
has a traitor in his operation.

25:16.774 --> 25:18.709
So...

25:18.776 --> 25:22.079
We need to find one.

25:22.130 --> 25:23.964
What? How the hell
are we supposed to do that?

25:24.049 --> 25:26.300
The Russians still have agents
back at the hotel, right?

25:26.384 --> 25:27.835
You gotta grab one.

25:27.919 --> 25:30.804
Make it look like he
betrayed his team and ran off.

25:30.889 --> 25:32.289
Oh, is that all?

25:32.340 --> 25:34.892
Just go back to the hotel
and kidnap a G.R.U. agent?

25:34.959 --> 25:37.261
Can I remind you that we barely
got out of there just now?

25:37.312 --> 25:39.430
At this point,
either Vladimir finds a traitor

25:39.481 --> 25:41.631
in his organization,
or the operation fails

25:41.683 --> 25:43.484
and Michael dies.

25:46.855 --> 25:48.772
Ironically,
one of the best times

25:48.823 --> 25:50.274
to go after enemies

25:50.325 --> 25:53.861
is just after they think
they've beaten you.

25:53.945 --> 25:56.413
No one expects an attack

25:56.481 --> 26:00.250
while they're still basking
in the glow of victory.

26:02.820 --> 26:05.589
- Okay, you ready?
- Ready enough.

26:14.466 --> 26:17.551
The key is to use
the opponent's overconfidence.

26:17.635 --> 26:20.804
The more comfortable they are
that they can handle any threat,

26:20.855 --> 26:22.106
the more likely it is

26:22.173 --> 26:26.360
they'll leave themselves
vulnerable.

26:38.790 --> 26:41.158
Ivan, I need
your bank account number

26:41.209 --> 26:42.209
and your password.

26:42.293 --> 26:44.244
What? What for?

26:44.329 --> 26:47.381
You already made it look
like I give information to CIA.

26:47.465 --> 26:49.633
My friend just kidnapped
a G.R.U. agent in Cuba,

26:49.700 --> 26:51.635
and you're going to help
make it look like

26:51.702 --> 26:53.370
he's been getting payoffs.

26:53.421 --> 26:55.222
Account number, Ivan.
Now.

26:55.306 --> 26:57.474
I can't. No.

26:57.542 --> 26:58.725
Let me make this easy
for you.

26:58.810 --> 27:00.344
Either you do as we ask,

27:00.395 --> 27:03.230
or I dump your ass
at the Russian consulate,

27:03.314 --> 27:04.765
and they shoot you
on the spot.

27:04.849 --> 27:06.900
Kill me.
Just do it.

27:06.985 --> 27:08.402
After what you have done,

27:08.486 --> 27:10.654
the whole world will think
I'm traitor to my country.

27:10.721 --> 27:13.023
You spend your time
spying on dissidents

27:13.074 --> 27:14.558
and shaking down
small businesses.

27:14.609 --> 27:16.893
You know, the last I checked,
it's not a big step down

27:16.945 --> 27:20.030
from corrupt spy to traitor.

27:22.367 --> 27:24.418
Fine.

27:24.502 --> 27:26.736
I give it to you.

27:26.788 --> 27:30.407
But first, I want you
to do something for me.

27:30.458 --> 27:32.742
I want you to write a letter.

27:32.794 --> 27:33.877
To my girlfriend.

27:33.928 --> 27:36.746
- To your girlfriend?
- Yes.

27:36.798 --> 27:40.517
Her name is Eva.

27:40.585 --> 27:43.770
Just write down what I say
and send.

27:43.855 --> 27:46.023
It is all I ask.

27:46.090 --> 27:48.942
I think we can do that.

27:52.597 --> 27:57.100
What do you wanna say?

27:57.151 --> 27:59.953
Tell her she was my life.

28:00.038 --> 28:03.907
Until I met her,
I had no happiness.

28:03.958 --> 28:06.660
I did not want to join G.R.U.
as a young man,

28:06.744 --> 28:09.796
but I had no choice.

28:09.881 --> 28:13.116
Tell her I'm sorry I can't
pay for school, because--

28:13.167 --> 28:14.167
School?

28:14.252 --> 28:16.620
Eva goes to nursing school.

28:16.671 --> 28:20.173
The money in the account
was for her.

28:23.344 --> 28:25.596
Give me the account number.

28:25.647 --> 28:27.514
I'll send 500 bucks to Cuba,

28:27.599 --> 28:31.985
and the rest I'll put
into an account for Eva.

28:32.070 --> 28:35.105
Thank you.

28:35.156 --> 28:37.658
And tell Eva...

28:37.742 --> 28:40.160
Tell her good-bye.

28:57.929 --> 29:00.664
What's going on?

29:00.715 --> 29:01.998
We found the traitor.

29:02.050 --> 29:03.467
One of the men I sent

29:03.518 --> 29:05.886
to investigate
the CIA safe house disappeared

29:05.970 --> 29:08.639
with all of the documents,
all of the evidence.

29:08.690 --> 29:11.024
- You sure it's him?
- Yes.

29:11.109 --> 29:13.644
The G.R.U. agent in Miami
was sending him money.

29:13.695 --> 29:16.113
So we can
get out of here now?

29:16.180 --> 29:18.615
We will get the prisoner
and go.

29:18.683 --> 29:21.234
Your CIA source,
he can get us away?

29:21.319 --> 29:22.653
Absolutely.

29:22.704 --> 29:24.020
He's at a marina outside
of the city with a boat.

29:24.072 --> 29:26.540
I just need to know
you will take care of us.

29:26.624 --> 29:29.242
This prisoner,
she is top priority for Moscow.

29:29.327 --> 29:33.196
As long as she is safe,
you will be well rewarded.

29:33.247 --> 29:36.500
Oh, believe me, we will
definitely take care of her.

29:36.551 --> 29:38.502
All right,
let's go get this Sonya.

29:38.553 --> 29:40.587
Sounds like
we're good to go.

29:40.672 --> 29:42.389
Mike's working his magic.

29:42.473 --> 29:43.557
Guy's taking
the girl right out

29:43.641 --> 29:44.675
and not even bringing
any guards.

29:44.726 --> 29:45.809
Don't get ahead
of yourself.

29:45.876 --> 29:47.544
This ain't over yet.

30:12.837 --> 30:14.237
What the hell is going on?

30:14.288 --> 30:15.672
I don't like
the sound of this.

30:15.740 --> 30:17.007
Vladimir,
what are you doing?

30:17.074 --> 30:18.375
We need to go now.

30:18.426 --> 30:19.710
No more.

30:19.761 --> 30:21.211
That was Moscow.

30:21.262 --> 30:23.580
There's a Russian submarine
offshore.

30:23.631 --> 30:26.266
It is diverting here.

30:26.351 --> 30:29.636
Don't look so worried.
You've done a good thing today.

30:29.721 --> 30:31.188
Incredible, yes?

30:31.255 --> 30:34.924
The new friend of Moscow.

30:34.976 --> 30:36.476
The CIA are en route.

30:36.561 --> 30:38.278
Let them come!

30:38.363 --> 30:39.813
They are sending
a full commando team

30:39.897 --> 30:41.281
to protect the prisoner.

30:41.366 --> 30:44.267
Also, the interrogators,
to find more traitors here.

31:01.397 --> 31:02.824
This is bad.

31:02.825 --> 31:04.275
This place is already
impossible to hit,

31:04.326 --> 31:06.244
it's about to get
even more impossible.

31:06.311 --> 31:07.328
What the hell
are we gonna do?

31:07.413 --> 31:08.780
I say we
just call this off

31:08.831 --> 31:11.148
and start trying to negotiate
for Mike's release.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.201
No, we're not negotiating
with anyone.

31:13.285 --> 31:14.252
We got a mission
to complete.

31:14.319 --> 31:15.653
Yeah, hey, pal,

31:15.704 --> 31:17.255
maybe you haven't
been paying attention here,

31:17.322 --> 31:19.207
but this mission is toast.

31:19.291 --> 31:20.375
Mike's trapped in there.

31:20.459 --> 31:22.677
We're not negotiating
with anyone!

31:22.761 --> 31:24.996
We have a mission
that needs to be completed.

31:25.047 --> 31:26.214
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

31:26.298 --> 31:27.682
How's that
supposed to work, huh?

31:27.766 --> 31:29.550
You got some army around here
that I'm not aware of?

31:29.635 --> 31:32.103
Even if you did,
by some miracle, have an army,

31:32.170 --> 31:33.221
I still don't
see how they'd get

31:33.305 --> 31:36.107
your precious Sonya
out alive.

31:38.360 --> 31:39.944
He's got a point, Burke.

31:40.012 --> 31:43.180
This isn't looking good.

31:43.232 --> 31:45.349
How much semtex
do we have left?

31:45.401 --> 31:47.735
About a couple pounds,
maybe?

31:47.820 --> 31:49.153
Enough to get through
a wall or two.

31:49.204 --> 31:51.072
But we don't even know
where they are in there.

31:51.156 --> 31:53.157
I'll take it in myself.

31:53.208 --> 31:56.160
Okay, and how do you propose
to walk in there

31:56.211 --> 31:58.029
with two pounds
of high explosive?

31:58.080 --> 32:00.381
I'll tell them
I'm Michael's CIA contact.

32:00.466 --> 32:03.034
We load the laptop
full of semtex,

32:03.085 --> 32:07.171
I find them,
blast us out,

32:07.222 --> 32:08.756
and you two pick us up.

32:08.841 --> 32:10.875
- Oh, that easy, huh?
- No, it's not that easy.

32:10.926 --> 32:12.343
I can't think
of another plan

32:12.394 --> 32:14.095
that's that's gonna
get everyone else out alive.

32:14.179 --> 32:17.015
You're not buying it?
No, I'm not.

32:17.066 --> 32:20.551
Know this--
I've never left anyone behind.

32:20.602 --> 32:21.853
The people who work with me,

32:21.904 --> 32:23.387
the people
who fight alongside me,

32:23.439 --> 32:27.058
that's my family.

32:27.109 --> 32:28.943
I'm not gonna leave
Michael behind or Sonya.

32:29.028 --> 32:30.862
No one.

32:30.913 --> 32:34.032
If you want to see Michael
alive again...

32:34.083 --> 32:36.167
Help me get him out.

32:36.234 --> 32:38.836
Will you do that?

32:38.904 --> 32:41.039
Yeah.

32:41.090 --> 32:42.540
Yeah, you got it.

32:55.921 --> 32:59.774
I wanna see, uh,
Vladimir Duboff.

32:59.858 --> 33:04.228
I'm a friend
of Michael Westen.

33:04.279 --> 33:05.897
Wait here.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.520
Got to hand it to Burke,
the guy leads from the front.

33:10.569 --> 33:12.320
I'm not joining
the Randall Burke fan club

33:12.404 --> 33:14.072
just yet.

33:14.123 --> 33:17.408
I still don't see how this plan
gets Mike and Sonya out.

33:17.459 --> 33:20.211
Guess we're about
to find out.

33:28.253 --> 33:31.389
You are Westen's CIA contact,
I assume.

33:31.456 --> 33:32.673
You assume correctly.

33:32.758 --> 33:35.760
I owe you
debt of gratitude then.

33:35.811 --> 33:38.129
Your information
was extremely helpful.

33:38.180 --> 33:39.680
Then why are we still here?

33:39.765 --> 33:41.899
I've been waiting
at the marina for hours.

33:41.967 --> 33:43.401
- Calm down.
- Calm down?

33:43.468 --> 33:44.819
You want me to--
did Michael tell you

33:44.903 --> 33:46.487
about the CIA team
on their way here?

33:46.572 --> 33:47.572
- Yes, he told me.
- Okay.

33:47.606 --> 33:49.023
It's not a problem.

33:49.108 --> 33:50.908
Reinforcements are coming.

33:50.976 --> 33:52.810
We are perfectly safe
right here.

33:54.997 --> 33:56.664
Okay, well,
that's comforting.

33:56.748 --> 33:57.982
But that only addresses

33:58.033 --> 33:59.417
half my problem.

33:59.484 --> 34:01.252
As of today,
I'm officially unemployed

34:01.319 --> 34:03.921
from the U.S.
intelligence services.

34:03.989 --> 34:08.092
I'd like to defect.
I wanna make a deal.

34:08.159 --> 34:10.161
What exactly
do you have to offer?

34:10.212 --> 34:11.963
Well, I got
this agency-issued laptop,

34:12.014 --> 34:13.431
for one thing.

34:13.498 --> 34:15.766
It's got operational
platforms,

34:15.833 --> 34:18.518
agent code names,
everything.

34:18.603 --> 34:20.304
For the right price,
Vladimir,

34:20.355 --> 34:22.172
any database
you've ever dreamed of,

34:22.224 --> 34:25.143
I'll log you onto.

34:25.194 --> 34:27.777
I am sure we can
come to an agreement.

34:27.846 --> 34:30.347
Not so quick there, cowboy.

34:30.399 --> 34:32.567
Let me make sure
Michael's fine first.

34:32.650 --> 34:34.902
After that, we'll talk.

34:34.987 --> 34:36.237
And you better make it quick.

34:36.321 --> 34:38.539
Once the CIA finds out
I'm gone,

34:38.623 --> 34:42.359
these precious codes
are gonna change.

34:44.413 --> 34:46.581
Fine.

34:46.665 --> 34:48.532
Come with me.

34:53.138 --> 34:56.007
Michael.

34:56.058 --> 34:57.592
Boy, we missed you
at the marina.

34:57.676 --> 34:58.709
Burke.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.061
I was trying
to get over there,

35:00.145 --> 35:02.563
but things took
an unexpected turn.

35:02.648 --> 35:05.883
Yeah, I'll say.

35:05.934 --> 35:08.186
So...

35:08.237 --> 35:11.405
This is where
they got you, huh?

35:11.490 --> 35:12.406
Nice.

35:12.491 --> 35:13.891
Is for safety.

35:13.942 --> 35:16.494
This is the most secure room
in the building.

35:16.561 --> 35:18.529
You see he's fine.

35:18.580 --> 35:20.414
Maybe he is,
maybe he isn't.

35:20.499 --> 35:21.916
I'll be the judge of that.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.534
Tell you what, why don't you
give us a minute?

35:23.585 --> 35:24.735
That's unnecessary.

35:24.786 --> 35:26.537
You want the codes
to the computer,

35:26.588 --> 35:30.758
give us a minute.

35:34.263 --> 35:36.097
Thank you.

35:38.850 --> 35:40.351
What the hell
are you doing here?

35:40.418 --> 35:41.852
Getting you out.

35:41.920 --> 35:42.937
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:43.021 --> 35:44.021
Have you looked around?

35:44.089 --> 35:45.022
There's no way to get out.

35:45.090 --> 35:47.475
Well, there will be.

35:47.559 --> 35:49.527
I'm gonna take care
of the guards in the hall

35:49.594 --> 35:51.028
and breach a wall
to the outside.

35:51.096 --> 35:54.482
Can you take care of the guards
in here and get her out?

35:54.566 --> 35:56.284
Yeah, I can.
But how--

35:56.368 --> 35:58.619
There's no time
to explain, Mike.

35:58.704 --> 36:02.073
Just understand,
she is all that matters.

36:05.110 --> 36:07.128
Michael...

36:07.212 --> 36:08.996
Do you believe in me?

36:09.081 --> 36:12.416
Do you trust me?

36:12.467 --> 36:15.720
Then you need
to believe in her.

36:15.787 --> 36:19.507
She is the key
to your future.

36:19.591 --> 36:21.792
She's everything.

36:21.843 --> 36:25.563
Promise me
you'll get her out.

36:25.630 --> 36:28.465
Yeah, I promise.

36:35.157 --> 36:37.992
It's been an honor, Mike.

36:41.613 --> 36:44.498
Okay, we're good,
all set.

36:44.583 --> 36:47.752
Let's go upstairs
and get this thing started.

36:52.958 --> 36:55.326
Not here!

36:55.377 --> 36:57.962
We can do it later,
in my office.

36:58.013 --> 37:02.216
Vladimir, I think it's better
if you see what I have...

37:02.301 --> 37:05.936
Right now.

37:15.364 --> 37:18.032
Jesus!

37:18.116 --> 37:19.450
That's our cue.

37:19.517 --> 37:21.018
All right, hang on.

37:49.681 --> 37:51.849
Where the hell are they?

38:14.790 --> 38:16.907
- Where the hell is Burke?
- He didn't make it.

38:20.912 --> 38:22.263
Heads up!

38:44.500 --> 38:45.834
Ivan.

38:45.885 --> 38:47.552
A word of advice.

38:47.636 --> 38:50.338
The G.R.U. are all over Miami
looking for you,

38:50.389 --> 38:53.558
and they are very,
very angry.

38:53.642 --> 38:55.643
There's a bus to Des Moines
in an hour.

38:55.711 --> 38:57.479
I suggest you get on it
and don't look back.

38:57.546 --> 39:00.515
Before I go,
I-I must ask about Eva.

39:00.566 --> 39:01.649
Did you send the letter?

39:01.717 --> 39:03.852
No, we did not.

39:03.903 --> 39:05.019
Why?

39:05.070 --> 39:06.554
This was part of agreement.

39:06.605 --> 39:08.907
Well,<i>we</i>
thought better of it.

39:08.991 --> 39:11.159
They won't be able
to find either of you

39:11.226 --> 39:13.945
if you keep your head down
and use these.

39:14.029 --> 39:15.530
They're fake I.D.s.

39:15.581 --> 39:17.999
And there's also
some brochures

39:18.066 --> 39:21.402
for nursing schools
in Iowa.

39:21.453 --> 39:23.505
Wwait, is Eva--

39:23.572 --> 39:26.758
She's inside the bus station,
waiting for you.

39:26.842 --> 39:29.294
But I-I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

39:29.378 --> 39:33.047
It's hard to explain.
Let's just say...

39:33.098 --> 39:36.417
We like the idea of a spy...

39:36.468 --> 39:39.220
getting a chance
to start over.

39:39.271 --> 39:42.440
Go.
Before I change my mind.

39:55.204 --> 39:56.905
Hey, so, Mike,
about Burke.

39:56.956 --> 39:58.740
Sounds like he gave up his life
for this Sonya.

39:58.791 --> 40:00.625
Yeah, he did.

40:00.709 --> 40:01.626
That's a hell
of a sacrifice.

40:01.710 --> 40:03.161
Makes you wonder who she is.

40:03.245 --> 40:05.914
He said she was the future,
the key to everything.

40:05.965 --> 40:07.999
That's it?
What the hell does that mean?

40:08.083 --> 40:09.584
I don't know.
That's what we need to find out.

40:09.635 --> 40:10.885
Yeah, Jesse?

40:10.953 --> 40:12.303
What the hell's
taking you guys so long?

40:12.388 --> 40:14.923
We just got to the marina now.
Everything all right?

40:14.974 --> 40:16.391
Other than the fact
that we probably

40:16.458 --> 40:17.926
have most
of the Cuban military

40:17.977 --> 40:19.293
and a submarine full of Russian
commandos searching for us,

40:19.345 --> 40:20.395
everything's super.

40:20.462 --> 40:23.731
How's Sonya?

40:23.799 --> 40:24.933
She's still unconscious.

40:24.984 --> 40:26.017
Whatever Vladimir
used to sedate her

40:26.101 --> 40:27.235
knocked her out
pretty good.

40:27.302 --> 40:28.803
It'll be a while
before she wakes up.

40:28.854 --> 40:30.438
There she is, Mike.

40:30.489 --> 40:32.657
There's our beautiful
30-foot ride back to Miami.

40:32.741 --> 40:34.261
All right,
looks like the boat's clear.

40:34.276 --> 40:36.310
We're heading back to you now.
See if you can wake Sonya.

40:36.362 --> 40:37.478
Yeah, I'll try.

40:37.529 --> 40:39.447
Listen, you guys
need to hurry up--aah!

40:39.498 --> 40:40.531
No, no, no--wait!
Jesse.

40:40.616 --> 40:41.583
Jesse!

40:41.650 --> 40:44.419
The line's dead.
Crap!

40:53.712 --> 40:56.381
Jesus.

40:56.465 --> 40:59.333
Hey, Jesse.

40:59.385 --> 41:00.802
Hey, hey, Jesse.

41:00.853 --> 41:03.004
Hey, buddy, can you hear me?

41:03.055 --> 41:04.806
Huh?
Yeah.

41:04.857 --> 41:06.891
Hey, Mike, he's all right.
He's breathing.

41:06.976 --> 41:08.509
What the hell
happened to you?

41:08.560 --> 41:11.779
I got hit from behind.

41:11.847 --> 41:12.864
She's gone.

41:12.948 --> 41:14.616
Wait, she did this?

41:14.683 --> 41:16.701
Oh, son of a bitch.

41:16.785 --> 41:18.403
I thought she was out, guys.
I'm sorry.

41:18.487 --> 41:21.823
Mike, what do we do now?

41:21.874 --> 41:24.324
Find her.
