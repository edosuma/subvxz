00:25.625 --> 00:27.192
Good evening.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.660
I'm Helen Mirren,

00:28.662 --> 00:31.130
and you're watching
"Documentary Now!",

00:31.132 --> 00:33.032
season 51.

00:33.034 --> 00:36.769
In 1968, filmmakers
Larry and Abraham Fein

00:36.771 --> 00:39.772
traveled the country with four
door-to-door salesmen.

00:39.774 --> 00:44.076
The result was a look inside
the heartbreak, rejection,

00:44.078 --> 00:46.445
and ultimate triumph

00:46.447 --> 00:48.180
of globesmen.

00:56.489 --> 01:00.325
So this is...
a globe.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.194
You got all the different
countries in it,

01:02.196 --> 01:04.730
and then the continents.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.099
They did blue for the oceans.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.134
The...
globe is tilted up

01:09.136 --> 01:10.335
so that when you face it...

01:10.337 --> 01:12.204
Hey, he's a natural at this.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.839
Mom...

01:13.841 --> 01:16.175
When guests come over,
and, you know, they see a globe,

01:16.177 --> 01:17.743
they're gonna know immediately

01:17.745 --> 01:20.546
they're in the presence
of somebody who's worldly.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.081
You know.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.416
We don't really
have guests over.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.784
Well,

01:25.786 --> 01:27.686
I...
I promise you

01:27.688 --> 01:29.855
that if you have a globe
in the home,

01:29.857 --> 01:32.191
you're gonna find reasons
to invite them over.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.660
You're gonna want them
to come over.

01:34.662 --> 01:35.761
What are you doing there?

01:37.164 --> 01:38.464
You got...
You got blocks?

01:38.466 --> 01:39.665
You know my name?

01:39.667 --> 01:41.400
Can you guess my name?

01:43.637 --> 01:44.837
It's Tom.

01:49.844 --> 01:52.277
Well, these are...

01:52.279 --> 01:54.646
$49.95.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.748
I just don't feel comfortable...

01:56.750 --> 02:00.385
buying something without
discussing it with my husband.

02:01.888 --> 02:04.256
What if... your...
your husband

02:04.258 --> 02:06.425
comes home after
a long day's work,

02:06.427 --> 02:08.160
and he sees...

02:08.162 --> 02:10.262
"What are you smiling about?"

02:10.264 --> 02:12.865
And then you point
to the middle of the room,

02:12.867 --> 02:15.567
and his face lights up?

02:15.569 --> 02:18.770
And he says, "Is that a globe?"

02:20.707 --> 02:22.608
I think it's a no.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.314
Hi there, I'm...
Bob Campbell

02:29.316 --> 02:30.616
from Amalgamated Globe.

02:30.618 --> 02:32.718
You...
You filled out a card of interest

02:32.720 --> 02:34.286
from the "National Geographic"...

02:34.288 --> 02:35.687
I don't know what
you're talking about.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.356
Margaret M...

02:46.299 --> 02:49.835
It's very nice, but we just
can't afford it right now.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.905
Well, I respect that
of a woman who...

02:52.907 --> 02:55.874
you know, is careful
with the money and whatnot,

02:55.876 --> 02:58.210
but I... I think that...
you're gonna...

02:58.212 --> 03:01.213
This globe
is gonna last you

03:01.215 --> 03:02.548
the rest of your life,
you know.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.184
And I think your husband
would agree with that.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.652
My husband is in the hospital.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.320
He fell off a crane.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.289
They're not sure if he's
gonna walk again.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.292
That's awful.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.893
That's...
That's truly awful.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.395
I'm very sorry about that.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.729
It's very awful.

03:20.266 --> 03:22.734
I think what would make him
feel better, though,

03:22.736 --> 03:25.204
is maybe if you showed up
with a a globe.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.575
Well, we... we can't even
cover the medical bills.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.243
I'm working two jobs as it is.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.511
They just turned off the heat,

03:32.513 --> 03:34.213
and I think my son Tommy
might be deaf.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.414
Okay.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.548
Which one's Tommy?

03:36.550 --> 03:37.849
That one.

03:39.652 --> 03:41.220
Tommy!

03:41.222 --> 03:43.255
Tommy!

03:43.257 --> 03:44.690
Tommy!
Tommy!

03:44.692 --> 03:46.458
There he is.
See?

03:46.460 --> 03:48.627
He's looking at me.

03:48.629 --> 03:51.496
I think you...
would very much regret it

03:51.498 --> 03:53.432
if you did not buy this globe.

03:57.337 --> 03:59.004
281...

03:59.006 --> 04:01.240
Euclid.

04:04.877 --> 04:07.546
Christ on a bike.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.794
How's the battle, boys?

04:22.796 --> 04:24.630
One...

04:24.632 --> 04:26.498
Two...

04:26.500 --> 04:27.899
Three...

04:27.901 --> 04:29.301
Four.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.003
Take a bow,
Mike Stankowicz.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.972
Yeah, I ran across an old lady

04:33.974 --> 04:36.575
who bought one
for each of her kids.

04:38.579 --> 04:41.346
What I wouldn't do
for a nice old lady.

04:41.348 --> 04:42.981
I'm telling you,
every name they give me

04:42.983 --> 04:45.450
is a deadbeat or a layabout.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.386
It's been this way for months.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.820
Don't worry about it.
You'll get 'em, Possum.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.589
Yeah.

04:50.591 --> 04:53.058
I should have been a fireman
like my pops.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.028
I'm good at finding smoke.

04:56.030 --> 04:57.696
A lot of people
have that talent.

04:57.698 --> 04:58.797
I don't think that's
a specialism.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.766
No, not like me.
Not like me.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.769
I could see that
black smoke miles away.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.070
Is there any beer?

05:05.072 --> 05:06.505
No, we're out.

05:06.507 --> 05:09.441
Do you know why
I love my job?

05:11.344 --> 05:14.079
Because I get to see
the world every day.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.051
Feel free to use that.

05:19.053 --> 05:20.452
Although if you do,
I'd like you to tell people

05:20.454 --> 05:21.987
you heard it from me.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.388
I don't want you to use it
and then make it seem

05:23.390 --> 05:24.423
like you came up with it.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.024
Now, you may notice

05:26.026 --> 05:28.560
a few faces missing
from our last meeting.

05:28.562 --> 05:31.063
Well, it was decided that those
weren't the kind of people

05:31.065 --> 05:33.699
we wanted representing
Amalgamated Globes.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.501
They were kind of men
who made excuses.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.969
Let me tell you something.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.571
Every name we give you

05:39.573 --> 05:41.640
is the name of a person
who filled out our card

05:41.642 --> 05:43.775
in "National Geographic"

05:43.777 --> 05:45.610
and then marched that card
down to the mailbox.

05:45.612 --> 05:46.845
Now, does that sound like

05:46.847 --> 05:48.046
something a person would do

05:48.048 --> 05:49.047
out of whimsy?

05:49.049 --> 05:50.048
No.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.050
If you have their name,

05:52.052 --> 05:53.785
they want a globe.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.687
Now get out there
and sell it to 'em.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.769
Son of a bitch.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.052
♪ A wish granted me,
oh, a king I would be. ♪

06:27.054 --> 06:29.888
♪ If I had coins piled
high to the sky, ♪

06:29.890 --> 06:31.823
♪ with a queen in my bed, ♪

06:31.825 --> 06:35.594
♪ and a crown on my head... ♪

06:50.443 --> 06:51.643
Hello?

06:59.652 --> 07:01.086
Globe salesman.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.688
Hello?

07:05.459 --> 07:06.958
Get out!

07:06.960 --> 07:08.927
We don't want to buy
your stinking globes!

07:08.929 --> 07:09.928
Yeah!

07:11.731 --> 07:13.565
That was not nice.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.775
This is the card
you filled out...

07:23.777 --> 07:25.911
in the "National Geographic"
saying you were interested

07:25.913 --> 07:26.912
in the globe.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.146
Well, I wanted a globe,

07:28.148 --> 07:30.115
but then a stopped by
selling atlases,

07:30.117 --> 07:31.683
so I bought one of those.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.518
It's a beautiful book.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.786
I'll show you.

07:38.925 --> 07:41.193
You remember the name
of the man

07:41.195 --> 07:42.794
who sold you that atlas?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.095
I don't know, it was like a...

07:44.097 --> 07:45.964
German name or something.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.032
It was like...

07:47.034 --> 07:49.534
Mikter...

07:49.536 --> 07:50.836
Vic... Victor?

07:50.838 --> 07:53.238
Richter?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.907
Karl Richter?

07:55.909 --> 07:57.709
Yeah, that was it.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.144
Isn't it beautiful?

07:59.146 --> 08:00.946
Gold leaf.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.247
Very nice.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.251
I got two silver stars,

08:06.253 --> 08:07.652
and I'm losing commissions

08:07.654 --> 08:09.821
to a guy named Karl,

08:09.823 --> 08:11.590
with a K.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.892
How is Richter always
in our territory

08:13.894 --> 08:15.527
a week before we are?

08:15.529 --> 08:18.196
Karl's got ESP or something;
he really does.

08:18.198 --> 08:21.132
Kind of makes you happy
that Patton's dead, you know?

08:21.134 --> 08:22.667
He'd be sick to see it.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.536
All right, fellas,
get you anything?

08:24.538 --> 08:25.904
Yeah, I'll take
some warm coffee.

08:25.906 --> 08:26.938
All right.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.640
And a Salisbury steak.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.109
And... can you fill
this prescription for me?

08:31.111 --> 08:32.510
All right.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.111
Do you have...
mashed pastrami?

08:35.883 --> 08:37.282
And I'll...
I'll take a...

08:37.284 --> 08:39.618
a pack of cigarettes,
thank you.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.087
How are the boys?

08:42.089 --> 08:44.956
What happened to their rabbit?

08:44.958 --> 08:47.926
It hasn't moved in four days?

08:47.928 --> 08:49.694
Well, it...

08:49.696 --> 08:51.863
it's dead, dear.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.131
It's dead.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.699
A rabbit doesn't
go without moving

08:54.701 --> 08:56.535
for four... four days.
It's...

08:56.537 --> 08:59.304
Well, you get rid of it.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.543
Hello?

09:09.916 --> 09:12.083
I...
I know that's you, Richter,

09:12.085 --> 09:13.885
you...
you son of a whore.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.788
You know, I don't...
I don't speak Kraut, okay?

09:16.790 --> 09:18.557
Go back to Germany!

09:21.561 --> 09:24.763
Been calling all night.

09:24.765 --> 09:25.997
Well, you guys look tired.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.599
What was it, Richter?

09:27.601 --> 09:31.069
Every 15 minutes,
the whole damn night.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.672
I don't know when
that Nazi sleeps.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.775
Who's going first?

09:36.777 --> 09:38.710
He's making it
a whole scene.

09:41.180 --> 09:43.815
Hello, I'm Gus McMichaels
from Amalgamated Globes.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.650
Please, come in.

09:45.652 --> 09:48.286
You filled out a card
in "National Geographic"

09:48.288 --> 09:50.221
saying you might be
interested in a globe.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.823
Yes, I did.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.024
How much?

09:53.026 --> 09:54.826
$49.95.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.995
I don't think we can
afford that, honey.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.798
My wife says we
can't afford that.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.032
Oh, come now.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.968
Look around.
I see nothing but quality.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.704
And this is the finest quality
globe you'll ever see.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.674
Okay.

10:09.676 --> 10:12.077
You see?
It's just that easy, fellas.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.311
I made the sale.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.846
It's just that easy.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.047
That's too easy.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.315
I want to take a turn.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.683
All right, come on.
Let's go.

10:18.685 --> 10:20.986
- Come on, Tommy.
- Who is it?

10:20.988 --> 10:25.690
Hi, I'm Gus McMichaels
from Amalgamated Globes.

10:25.692 --> 10:26.891
And you are?

10:26.893 --> 10:27.926
I'm Ray.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.128
I'm...
Ray Fantastic.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.396
Jesus, Tom.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.798
Come up with a better
name than that.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.333
I don't know.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.135
I'm not gonna call you
Mr. Fantastic.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.336
Miller.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.337
I'm Ray Miller.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.206
All right, come in.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.907
Now, you filled out a card?

10:42.909 --> 10:44.242
Yeah, yes I did.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.344
But... I...
I can't have a globe.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.946
I can't take it,
'cause...

10:47.948 --> 10:49.414
No, thank you.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.716
That's not an acceptable
answer for me.

10:51.718 --> 10:55.387
We... Well, I'm sorry,
but circumstances have changed,

10:55.389 --> 10:58.356
and... I no longer am
interested in getting a globe,

10:58.358 --> 11:01.726
so, you know, out you go.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.228
Did your wife say
she didn't want it?

11:03.230 --> 11:05.096
That's right.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.432
My wife said no globes.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.134
And you're such a pussy
that you let her

11:09.136 --> 11:10.235
call the shots like that?

11:10.237 --> 11:11.369
Jesus Christ.

11:11.371 --> 11:12.404
Yeah, why don't you be a man

11:12.406 --> 11:13.938
for once in your life, Tom?

11:13.940 --> 11:15.273
- Hey, back off, Gus.
- It's Ray.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.142
- No, you back off!
- My name is Ray.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.143
You're not part of this.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.144
So what's it gonna be?

11:19.146 --> 11:20.779
Are you gonna buy the globe,

11:20.781 --> 11:22.047
or do I go door to door
telling everyone in town

11:22.049 --> 11:23.415
you're a kept man?

11:23.417 --> 11:25.383
I'll buy it, all right?

11:25.385 --> 11:27.218
- Tommy...
- Give me two.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.987
Tommy, two?

11:28.989 --> 11:31.322
Get your book, and...
and... make it four.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.757
- All right.
- Yes.

11:32.759 --> 11:33.992
You win.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.894
See, boys?
It's just that easy.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.029
Now let's go to Florida.

11:42.101 --> 11:45.203
The sun and the surf...

11:45.205 --> 11:46.805
fresh air...

11:46.807 --> 11:48.239
I think Florida's
gonna be good for us,

11:48.241 --> 11:49.474
Oh, yeah.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.810
I already feel my luck
turning around.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.179
Look at this.
Beautiful.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.847
Nice.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.449
What's up?

11:57.451 --> 11:58.850
Oh, no!

11:58.852 --> 12:00.218
What is that?
There's something...

12:00.220 --> 12:01.820
- Karl Richter...
- What's the matter?

12:01.822 --> 12:03.488
- What is that?
- Pinnacle... It's dog crap.

12:03.490 --> 12:06.191
Fellas, you're not gonna
believe this...

12:06.193 --> 12:07.892
Jeez, he got you too?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.327
How the hell's he do this?

12:09.329 --> 12:10.895
I don't know, but we got
to get out there

12:10.897 --> 12:12.497
before the entire
state of Florida

12:12.499 --> 12:14.099
is reading their atlases.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.333
Come on.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.868
I'm...
I'm telling you,

12:16.870 --> 12:19.304
you are not gonna regret this.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.172
Congratulations.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.074
- Thank you.
- It's really wonderful.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.176
You know, Patrick
loves geography,

12:25.178 --> 12:27.045
so I'm sure we're gonna get
a lot of use out of it.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.480
That's a very smart young man,

12:28.482 --> 12:30.115
and you should be
very proud of him.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.382
Thanks.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.785
Bermuba?

12:33.787 --> 12:34.986
What's that, honey?

12:34.988 --> 12:37.922
It says "Bermuba"
instead of "Bermuda."

12:39.192 --> 12:42.393
It does say Bermuba.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.528
As opposed to what?

12:43.530 --> 12:44.996
Instead of Bermuda.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.799
It says Bermuba.

12:47.801 --> 12:51.469
It's an interesting fact with...
the globe

12:51.471 --> 12:55.874
and countries is that
both Bermuda and Bermuba

12:55.876 --> 12:57.342
are acceptable as names.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.544
So the locals there
call it Bermuba.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.112
There are...
There are a lot of...

13:01.114 --> 13:02.413
lot of countries that
are the same way.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.415
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.417
I'm...
I'm a globe salesman.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.486
This is my job.
I know these globes.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.054
I don't want a globe
with Bermuba.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.489
Why...
Don't talk to her. Talk to me.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.891
Talk to me, kid.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.425
And you...
you don't ruin a sale

13:14.427 --> 13:16.427
by pointing out mistakes.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.897
Sir, you need to leave.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.833
You're gonna be very happy
with this globe, ma'am.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.536
Very happy.

13:24.538 --> 13:27.238
$49.95, darling.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.241
And then just... There you go.
Signature right there, darling.

13:31.844 --> 13:34.445
Do you know what I love
about my job?

13:34.447 --> 13:37.549
I get to see the world
every day.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.217
I didn't come up with that.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.820
My... My manager came
up with that, but it's...

14:05.277 --> 14:06.477
So as you can see,

14:06.479 --> 14:08.012
it's a very top-quality globe.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.115
How much is it?

14:11.117 --> 14:13.284
It's $49.95.

14:13.286 --> 14:17.255
That's very reasonable.

14:17.257 --> 14:20.258
Well, that is very nice
to hear you say.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.327
Very nice indeed.

14:22.329 --> 14:23.895
You will not believe
the number of people

14:23.897 --> 14:25.230
who hear a price like that

14:25.232 --> 14:27.966
and immediately try
to Jew you down.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.407
It strikes me that as
soon as I said that...

14:36.409 --> 14:39.310
that Rothstein
is most likely

14:39.312 --> 14:40.945
a Jewish name.

14:40.947 --> 14:43.248
Right?
I'm right.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.194
You know, when I'm
designing a globe,

14:56.196 --> 14:59.130
a lot of times,
I want to give up...

14:59.132 --> 15:00.965
Usually during Africa.

15:00.967 --> 15:03.601
There are so many
African countries.

15:03.603 --> 15:07.372
Would anyone care if I left out
a Mozambique

15:07.374 --> 15:10.141
or a...
Or Rhodesia?

15:10.143 --> 15:13.044
No.
That's not what it's about.

15:13.046 --> 15:16.481
It's about respect for myself

15:16.483 --> 15:18.983
and the job that I do.

15:18.985 --> 15:20.585
Now, I'm asking you

15:20.587 --> 15:23.955
to find that same respect
for yourselves.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.260
With that in mind,

15:29.262 --> 15:31.396
I'd like to invite you all
to stand

15:31.398 --> 15:34.132
and speak to your goals
in the coming year.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.967
I think if I really
put my mind to it,

15:35.969 --> 15:38.670
I can make about $40,000.

15:44.576 --> 15:47.512
For me,
I won't be happy

15:47.514 --> 15:50.014
with a penny under $60,000.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.118
I didn't know we go
go as high as 60.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.254
Should I go?

15:56.256 --> 15:58.723
I'm not having a very easy time.

15:58.725 --> 16:02.293
I'm on a bit
of a cold streak.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.561
I'm sure you've all been there,

16:03.563 --> 16:06.030
but...
I doubt any of you

16:06.032 --> 16:10.134
have ever been as...
cold as I am right now.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.204
You know, my...
dad was a fireman,

16:13.206 --> 16:15.640
and I should have followed
in his footsteps,

16:15.642 --> 16:19.577
but I didn't, so, you know,
c'est la vie.

16:19.579 --> 16:24.415
I would be happy with
two grand, three grand...

16:24.417 --> 16:26.517
you know, maybe send
something to my wife

16:26.519 --> 16:30.221
if she hasn't left me yet.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.124
That's all I have to say, so...
Who's next?

16:33.126 --> 16:36.394
I'd like to change mine
from 40,000 to 60,000.

16:36.396 --> 16:39.697
I didn't know we
could go that high.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.737
Hey, you'll get 'em next time,
okay, Possum?

16:45.739 --> 16:47.505
Yeah, yeah.

16:47.507 --> 16:51.242
All right, I got...
Sunset Terrace.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.543
What do you got?

16:52.545 --> 16:54.345
Oh, hey, fellas.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.646
Fellas, fellas, fellas.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.215
Look at the license plate
on that car.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.616
It says Atlas.

16:58.618 --> 17:01.252
- That's Richter.
- That's Richter!

17:01.254 --> 17:03.121
- That's Richter, all right.
- That's him.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.556
- It's Richter. It's him.
- What's he doing?

17:05.558 --> 17:07.392
- What's he doing?
- It's got to be him.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.127
- That's him.
- What's he doing right now?

17:09.128 --> 17:10.127
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.194
Is he buying gas, or is he...

17:11.196 --> 17:12.530
He's walking into...

17:12.531 --> 17:14.265
He's going
to the bathroom.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.500
Going to the bathroom.
That's what he's doing.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.101
We got to do something
with his car.

17:19.471 --> 17:20.637
Okay, all right.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.106
Now's our chance, guys.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.307
Hey, what are you doing?

17:23.309 --> 17:25.242
Cover me.
Move, move, move.

17:25.244 --> 17:26.477
- Cover me.
- Hey, fellas.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.246
Hey, I don't know...

17:28.248 --> 17:29.614
I don't like this.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.782
Hey, hey.

17:30.784 --> 17:33.151
What are we doing?

17:33.153 --> 17:34.819
Jesus.

17:41.827 --> 17:43.227
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

17:43.229 --> 17:44.529
- Go, go!
- What'd you do?

17:44.531 --> 17:45.797
Just get in the car.
Get in the car!

17:49.401 --> 17:51.569
Hey, here's to Karl Richter,

17:51.571 --> 17:54.539
the man who'll think twice

17:54.541 --> 17:57.775
before he crosses a globesman.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.477
Yes, hear, hear.
We did it.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.112
What we?
What'd you do?

18:01.114 --> 18:02.080
I did a lot.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.481
You...
You stood there.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.849
- You just stood there.
- No, I didn't.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.617
I was swinging.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.119
You know what,
let's play

18:08.121 --> 18:09.353
"pick it and stick it,"
all right?

18:09.355 --> 18:10.354
- Yeah!
- Play "pick it and stick it."

18:10.356 --> 18:11.689
Come on, come on.

18:11.691 --> 18:12.690
I don't know about
"pick it and stick it."

18:12.692 --> 18:13.791
Oh, come on.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.193
You in, Tommy?

18:15.195 --> 18:16.427
- I'll play.
- All right.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.862
- Who's got a knife?
- Call it.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.098
- Burma.
- Burma!

18:20.100 --> 18:21.399
Burma...

18:22.769 --> 18:25.470
- Panama.
- Drink up, you lousy bastard.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.273
All right, come on,
drink up, drink up.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.341
- All right.
- One more time.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.343
- Jamaica.
- Jamaica!

18:33.712 --> 18:35.279
I almost got it.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.547
Guys, you got to just
give that to him.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.182
- Come on.
- Drink up.

18:38.184 --> 18:39.684
He doesn't have to go again.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.552
He's almost drank a whole
bottle of whiskey.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.354
- He doesn't have to go again.
- I've done a lot.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.388
He looks fine.
Tommy, go...

18:44.390 --> 18:45.389
You look fine.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.795
Got a man down.

18:52.431 --> 18:53.731
Spin it.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.700
Oh, jeez.

18:55.702 --> 18:59.270
- Oh, yeah.
- Jesus.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.239
Jesus!

19:05.145 --> 19:06.444
Very funny.

19:06.446 --> 19:09.180
It is funny.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.648
Come on, guys, that
wasn't very nice.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.383
Oh, come on.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.185
This is my only suit,
you know!

19:15.221 --> 19:16.754
That wasn't that funny.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.222
Got to wash it in the sink.

19:18.224 --> 19:20.458
- Come on.
- Take it easy, Possum.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.660
You take it easy!

19:22.662 --> 19:24.262
The three of you!

19:24.264 --> 19:26.497
That's funny?
Me?

19:26.499 --> 19:28.299
On my suit?

19:28.301 --> 19:29.901
Possum, relax.

19:29.903 --> 19:31.636
I should have been
a fireman, like my...

19:31.638 --> 19:33.838
- A fireman?
- A fireman, yeah!

19:33.840 --> 19:35.439
Like my dad!

19:35.441 --> 19:37.208
I'd like to see you
be a fireman.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.844
They'd kick your ass
is what they'd do!

19:42.447 --> 19:45.316
Selling globes.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.684
I have nothing.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.197
What should we do?

19:59.199 --> 20:01.399
- Should we soak him again?
- No!

20:01.401 --> 20:02.800
- Don't soak him.
- What's the matter with you?

20:02.802 --> 20:04.302
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
You're right.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.570
Just let him sleep it off.

20:05.572 --> 20:08.272
Yeah, just let him
sleep it off.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.708
Just let the guy sleep,
all right?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.610
Yeah, I'm going to bed too.

20:12.612 --> 20:13.811
I'm gonna have a smoke.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.246
See you in the morning.

20:36.868 --> 20:38.703
So I'm very happy
that you bought this.

20:38.705 --> 20:39.704
This is gonna be very good.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.305
Very, very happy about this.

20:41.307 --> 20:42.873
I think you've made
a very good decision

20:42.875 --> 20:45.476
that you're not gonna regret,
I really do.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.245
Well, you certainly
do know how to sell it.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.846
Oh, well,
you know what?

20:48.848 --> 20:51.549
I believe in it,
and that makes it easy.

20:51.551 --> 20:52.883
It really does.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.353
Is he a salesman too?

20:55.355 --> 20:57.521
Yeah, that's Tommy.
That's Tommy.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.890
He's... He's in a bit
of a cold spell right now.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.792
Brought him along as a little
good luck charm,

21:01.794 --> 21:03.461
and it worked,
didn't it, Tommy?

21:03.463 --> 21:06.364
It worked out all right.
It's a temporary...

21:06.366 --> 21:07.865
Temporary cold funk,
but he'll...

21:07.867 --> 21:09.433
he'll snap out of it

21:09.435 --> 21:10.935
and being selling globes again
in no time.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.536
Well, I think it'll
be great for the kids.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.372
They're the right age
to learn about the world.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.439
Oh, yeah, beautiful children.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.607
How old are you?

21:16.609 --> 21:18.042
- I'm 11.
- I'm 13.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.577
Oh, 13.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.279
- 13?
- That's right.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.814
I certainly wouldn't
have guessed that.

21:23.816 --> 21:26.751
Why is that?

21:26.753 --> 21:28.586
Well, look at her.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.021
Look at her, meaning what?

21:30.023 --> 21:32.657
Look at...

21:32.659 --> 21:33.991
Tommy, I wouldn't
do that, please.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.059
Your daughter has the breasts

21:35.061 --> 21:36.494
of a much older woman

21:36.496 --> 21:37.595
is all I'm saying.

21:37.597 --> 21:38.629
- That's all.
- Tommy...

21:38.631 --> 21:39.897
And that's just a fact.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.732
You could be offended
all you want,

21:41.734 --> 21:43.701
but facts are facts, right?

21:43.703 --> 21:44.902
Am I right?

21:48.507 --> 21:50.508
Well, I you don't mind,
I'm going to...

21:50.510 --> 21:52.643
head out to the car.

21:52.645 --> 21:53.978
I bid you all a good day.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.379
I'll see you outside.

21:55.381 --> 21:58.582
You smell like pee.

21:58.584 --> 22:01.352
You could smell me
from over here?

22:01.354 --> 22:03.487
Tommy, don't...
don't do anything.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.762
Listen, it'd really mean a lot

22:11.764 --> 22:14.498
of you bought the globe from him
instead of me.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.335
What am I gonna say, please?

22:17.337 --> 22:18.669
I really don't want
to do anything

22:18.671 --> 22:20.371
to make him feel better.

22:20.373 --> 22:22.506
Hey, boss, here's what
I'm gonna do.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.508
Now listen...
Now listen, listen.

22:24.510 --> 22:27.078
I'm gonna give you the 50,
okay?

22:27.080 --> 22:30.348
You pay him with my money.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.549
Okay?

22:31.551 --> 22:34.552
I'm not gonna do that.
No.

22:34.554 --> 22:35.553
Here's an extra 20.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.421
$70 for a globe.

22:37.423 --> 22:39.390
Please.

22:39.392 --> 22:40.591
Please.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.628
- Fine.
- All right, thank you.

22:44.630 --> 22:47.064
Couldn't close it.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.999
They don't want the globe
from me anymore.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.468
Sorry.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.702
You got to go in and do it.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.038
- Me?
- Yes, you.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.506
I'll screw it up;
you saw what I did in there.

22:55.508 --> 22:56.874
What are you talking about?

22:56.876 --> 22:58.609
You're not gonna
screw up anything, come on.

22:58.611 --> 22:59.877
I open my mouth,
and, you know, it's just...

22:59.879 --> 23:01.011
Don't worry about
what happened.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.380
Come on, you're the possum.

23:02.382 --> 23:03.581
Come on, man,
that's what you do.

23:03.583 --> 23:04.949
You play dead, then you
come back to life.

23:04.951 --> 23:06.150
You're the possum.
Come on.

23:08.987 --> 23:10.554
Do it.
You do it.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.656
You're a legend.
Come on.

23:13.925 --> 23:15.593
Just help me out.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.561
- All right.
- Please.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.723
I made the sale.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.091
- Look at this.
- Yeah.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.426
I said, "I'm not gonna
leave this house

23:48.428 --> 23:50.027
until you buy a globe."

23:50.029 --> 23:51.762
He said, "Shut up, I'm gonna
buy the goddamn thing."

23:51.764 --> 23:53.063
Look at that.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.565
I knew it!

23:56.469 --> 23:57.568
- See, the trick is...
- Yeah?

23:57.570 --> 23:59.036
You have to have confidence.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.571
- You have to look 'em in the eye.
- That's right.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.072
That's the whole key
to the whole thing.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.774
- That's right.
- I was born to be a salesman.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.843
- That's right, yeah.
- I was born to sell globes.

24:05.845 --> 24:08.145
I mean, I have a talent for it.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.014
World's always gonna
need salesmen.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.582
And you're one of the best.

24:11.584 --> 24:12.783
Yeah, I'm the master, right?

24:12.785 --> 24:13.984
Yep.
