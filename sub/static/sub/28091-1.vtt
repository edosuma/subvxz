00:00.022 --> 00:01.819
Previosly on "When Calls The Heart"

00:01.845 --> 00:03.748
It's not wrong to give
someone a second chance

00:03.773 --> 00:05.922
or to believe in the
power of redemption.

00:05.947 --> 00:08.134
I am crediting you with time served

00:08.159 --> 00:10.113
and granting you immediate parole.

00:10.138 --> 00:11.984
We secured the northern territories.

00:12.017 --> 00:13.390
I heard the reports.

00:13.415 --> 00:15.401
I know the mounties lost a
lot of good men up there.

00:15.426 --> 00:17.570
Abigail, the bank is going under.

00:17.595 --> 00:19.529
You're the mayor, what're
you going to do about this?

00:19.554 --> 00:22.456
One investor will take this
town in a bad direction

00:22.481 --> 00:23.616
and the other won't.

00:23.641 --> 00:25.166
The bank is reopening.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.555
Carson saved another life.

00:26.580 --> 00:27.523
Carson did it.

00:27.548 --> 00:28.583
We did it.

00:28.608 --> 00:30.311
I choose you and no other.

00:30.336 --> 00:31.438
With this ring...

00:31.463 --> 00:32.658
I thee wed.

00:34.477 --> 00:35.675
To the bride and the groom.

00:35.700 --> 00:36.266
Here, here.

00:36.291 --> 00:37.453
- To the bride and groom.
- Here, here.

00:37.478 --> 00:38.488
To married life.

00:38.521 --> 00:40.289
To being married to you.

00:40.322 --> 00:41.116
Are you saying...

00:41.141 --> 00:42.624
I'm ready to get back together.

00:42.658 --> 00:43.789
Why don't you come by
the office tomorrow

00:43.814 --> 00:46.270
and we'll see if we can't find
you some kind of promotion.

00:46.295 --> 00:47.663
Thank you, Lee, I appreciate that.

00:47.695 --> 00:49.564
I've been given an
assignment at Fort Clay.

00:49.597 --> 00:50.871
You're leaving again?

00:50.896 --> 00:53.833
When someone like Jack gives
so much of themselves,

00:53.858 --> 00:55.166
they're never really gone.

00:55.191 --> 00:58.018
Elizabeth, you're gonna have a baby.

01:11.794 --> 01:14.576
<i>since little Jack Thornton was born.</i>

01:15.754 --> 01:19.692
<i>In that time I've learned that
motherhood is a lot of work</i>

01:19.717 --> 01:23.453
<i>but it also fills you
with profound joyous</i>

01:23.478 --> 01:25.544
<i>and unfettered love.</i>

01:26.915 --> 01:28.599
<i>I've also learned that
little Jack shares</i>

01:31.902 --> 01:35.262
<i>The women of Hope Valley

01:52.273 --> 01:55.784

01:56.301 --> 01:58.786
<i>It breaks my heart to be

01:59.334 --> 02:01.323
<i>Fortunately, my friends
have created a schedule</i>

02:01.348 --> 02:04.709

02:07.711 --> 02:11.474
<i>With everyone's help I'm hopeful

02:14.895 --> 02:16.220
Come in.

02:16.245 --> 02:17.411
Good morning.

02:17.436 --> 02:19.266
Good morning, Florence.

02:19.955 --> 02:21.731
Good, you have a bottle ready.

02:21.756 --> 02:25.864
I just love you so, so,
so, so, so, so, so much.

02:27.989 --> 02:29.191
Ohhh.

02:30.778 --> 02:32.361
Elizabeth?

02:33.718 --> 02:36.685
And when I come home I'm going
to bathe you and feed you

02:36.710 --> 02:41.622
and read to you and...
oh yes, and kiss you.

02:41.647 --> 02:43.282
It's only your second day back.

02:43.307 --> 02:45.250
You don't want to be late.

02:48.846 --> 02:50.283
Alright.

02:53.442 --> 02:54.910
Say goodbye to mommy.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.054
He will be fine.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.271
I promise.

03:09.549 --> 03:12.943
Oh, yes, you're such a lovely boy.

03:16.834 --> 03:18.479
Ok.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.589
I thought she'd never leave.

03:24.614 --> 03:27.459
We're gonna talk about
everybody in town.

03:51.136 --> 03:52.938
How is it being back at school?

03:53.152 --> 03:55.943
Well, I'm really glad to be
teaching my students again.

03:55.968 --> 03:57.615
But you're missing your baby.

03:57.640 --> 03:58.608
Terribly.

03:58.633 --> 03:59.735
Oh, Elizabeth.

03:59.827 --> 04:01.597
I know how much teaching means to you

04:01.622 --> 04:03.201
but this must be so hard on you.

04:03.226 --> 04:05.529
It's harder than I ever imagined.

04:06.729 --> 04:08.490
<i>You are amazing, Abigail.</i>

04:08.515 --> 04:09.838
<i>I still can't believe the telephone</i>

04:09.863 --> 04:11.209
<i>is coming to Hope Valley.</i>

04:11.234 --> 04:11.717
<i>Well.</i>

04:11.742 --> 04:14.154
Our little town is
stepping into the future.

04:14.619 --> 04:16.791
Abigail, are we still set for 4:00 pm?

04:16.817 --> 04:17.692
We are.

04:17.718 --> 04:19.534
Alright, I will have the band ready.

04:19.559 --> 04:20.380
The band?

04:20.404 --> 04:21.540
Well, of course.

04:21.709 --> 04:24.354
We can't have Hope Valley's
very first telephone call

04:24.379 --> 04:26.795
go by without a celebration.

04:26.820 --> 04:28.178
Silly me.

04:28.458 --> 04:29.693
Well, I should probably go.

04:29.718 --> 04:32.225
Time to squeeze in one final rehearsal.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.818
Are you coming?

04:34.843 --> 04:36.568
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss it.

04:36.593 --> 04:39.123
I'm also making this a learning
opportunity for my students.

04:39.148 --> 04:40.420
Oh.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.439
Good morning, Laura.

04:42.464 --> 04:44.633
Hi Mrs. Thornton, Mrs. Stenton.

04:44.658 --> 04:45.716
Good morning, Laura.

04:45.741 --> 04:47.029
Did the fishing line come in yet?

04:47.054 --> 04:48.323
It's coming later this morning.

04:48.348 --> 04:49.249
Oh.

04:49.274 --> 04:51.154
I need it for my
telephone project today.

04:51.179 --> 04:52.990
I can take it to the
school when it comes in.

04:53.019 --> 04:54.656
That's very sweet of you, thank you.

04:54.681 --> 04:55.949
How's it going, Ned?

04:55.974 --> 04:57.232
Ned?

04:57.755 --> 05:00.264
Oh, I just have to figure
out how to connect

05:00.289 --> 05:01.890
some of these wires.

05:02.823 --> 05:04.725
Will you be ready in time for the call?

05:05.731 --> 05:07.667
Oh, absolutely.

05:07.942 --> 05:10.865
He told the telephone company
he knows what to do.

05:11.002 --> 05:12.779
Well, I'm sure he'll figure it out.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.175
Hey Tom.

05:26.332 --> 05:28.234
I haven't seen you behind
the bar in a while.

05:28.259 --> 05:29.365
Yeah.

05:29.390 --> 05:31.100
Well, I've been in Union City.

05:31.125 --> 05:32.060
Oh.

05:32.085 --> 05:34.107
My mom's ill so the wife
and I moved up there

05:34.132 --> 05:35.199
to take care of her.

05:35.224 --> 05:36.527
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

05:36.552 --> 05:37.819
I hope she'll be ok.

05:37.844 --> 05:39.897
Well, it's a-it's a long-term thing.

05:39.922 --> 05:40.678
Ah.

05:40.703 --> 05:43.991
So I'm gonna have to figure
out what to do here.

05:44.016 --> 05:44.897
Hmm.

05:44.922 --> 05:48.592
I mean, I love this saloon and
the people of Hope Valley.

05:48.617 --> 05:50.936
It's mutual, believe me.

05:51.450 --> 05:55.231
It's just really, really
hard going back and forth.

05:56.286 --> 05:58.233
Listen, for what it's worth,

05:58.485 --> 06:01.850
in my experience I've found
that the happiest people

06:01.875 --> 06:04.824
are generally the people
that put family first.

06:05.743 --> 06:07.613
Anyway, I wish you the best of luck.

06:07.638 --> 06:08.940
You do what you gotta do.

06:08.965 --> 06:10.434
Thanks.

06:13.526 --> 06:15.464
Alright, here you go, Cody.

06:15.489 --> 06:17.221
Now, I want all of you to
move that way and keep going

06:17.246 --> 06:19.216
until the line goes tight.

06:20.475 --> 06:21.924
Keep going.

06:22.834 --> 06:24.843
Great. Perfect.

06:24.940 --> 06:28.052
Alright, now speaking into
the can creates sound waves

06:28.077 --> 06:30.121
which are converted into vibrations

06:30.146 --> 06:33.057
and the vibrations travel all
the way down the fishing line

06:33.082 --> 06:35.166
until they're converted
back into sound waves

06:35.191 --> 06:36.059
at the other end.

06:36.084 --> 06:37.816
Are you sure this is gonna work?

06:38.928 --> 06:41.197
Oh, I have no doubt it's going to work.

06:41.222 --> 06:42.570
Wow.

06:43.481 --> 06:44.882
Can you hear me?

06:44.907 --> 06:46.366
Loud and clear.

06:46.391 --> 06:48.134
Now I want all of you to pair up

06:48.159 --> 06:49.659
and you're going to make your own

06:49.684 --> 06:52.415
and you can experiment with
lines of all different lengths.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.624
I thought we were waiting
for more fishing line.

06:55.250 --> 06:57.219
Turn around, it's arrived.

06:57.771 --> 06:58.970
Laura!

06:58.995 --> 07:00.683
<i>We're making telephones
that really work.</i>

07:00.708 --> 07:02.043
Here you go, Cody.

07:03.352 --> 07:05.134
Thank you so much, Laura.

07:05.637 --> 07:06.771
You're welcome.

07:06.796 --> 07:08.679
Everyone get started.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.599
I want to return this.

07:11.624 --> 07:13.759
Wow, you finished it already?

07:14.092 --> 07:15.794
I love Jane Austin.

07:15.819 --> 07:17.118
Well, I have more of her books at home

07:17.143 --> 07:18.710
if you'd like to borrow them.

07:18.853 --> 07:19.855
Thanks.

07:19.880 --> 07:20.681
You're welcome.

07:20.706 --> 07:21.563
Why don't you come by tomorrow?

07:21.588 --> 07:22.189
I will.

07:22.214 --> 07:22.876
Very good.

07:22.901 --> 07:23.956
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

07:23.981 --> 07:24.982
Bye.

07:27.330 --> 07:29.616
You should feel proud, Abigail.

07:29.861 --> 07:31.231
Why is that?

07:31.256 --> 07:33.131
Bringing the telephone to Hope Valley.

07:33.156 --> 07:34.290
It's a big deal.

07:34.315 --> 07:36.784
Oh, the telephone's gonna be
everywhere someday, Henry.

07:36.809 --> 07:39.210
I just happened to be
mayor when it came here.

07:39.235 --> 07:41.210
In a small town like this though,

07:41.235 --> 07:42.864
I'm sure it took some persuasion.

07:42.889 --> 07:45.078
Well, maybe a little.

07:45.771 --> 07:47.941
I understand Lee's getting
one in his office, too.

07:47.966 --> 07:49.985
Yes, and there will be one
in the mercantile, the jail,

07:50.010 --> 07:50.938
and my office.

07:50.963 --> 07:52.626
That's a great start.

07:53.334 --> 07:55.685
However, not everyone is happy about it.

07:57.099 --> 07:59.001
Wire came in.

07:59.027 --> 08:00.696
Telephone company wants
to know if we'll be ready

08:00.721 --> 08:02.462
for a 4:00 call.

08:02.487 --> 08:04.401
Ned says we will be.

08:04.657 --> 08:05.792
Are you ready?

08:05.817 --> 08:08.753
The telegraph has worked fine
for almost 80 years now.

08:08.778 --> 08:11.909
Well, progress marches on
with or without us, Bill.

08:23.309 --> 08:24.778
Oh, and I forgot to tell you,

08:24.803 --> 08:26.829
we need more jelly beans for the kids.

08:26.869 --> 08:27.743
Ah. Hello?

08:27.768 --> 08:28.804
Ow.

08:31.071 --> 08:33.472
Your uh, your bandages came in.

08:35.517 --> 08:37.327
Can't wait to hear that
telephone ring today.

08:37.352 --> 08:39.221
Yes, yes. Me too.

08:39.246 --> 08:40.581
Are you ok?

08:40.606 --> 08:42.157
Oh, I'm fine, it's just a little bump.

08:42.182 --> 08:43.818
Let me take a look at it.

08:44.641 --> 08:45.821
Yeah, alright.

08:45.862 --> 08:47.131
I'll take care of that.

08:50.601 --> 08:51.485
Hello.

08:51.510 --> 08:52.577
Oh!

08:52.602 --> 08:53.868
Goodness.

08:53.893 --> 08:55.095
What is going on?

08:55.120 --> 08:56.876
Nothing, Ned just had a little accident.

08:57.061 --> 08:57.929
We're gonna need some-

08:57.962 --> 08:58.863
Alcohol.

08:58.888 --> 08:59.844
I've got some right here.

08:59.869 --> 09:01.758
Uh, I-I-I won't need that.

09:01.783 --> 09:03.503
Ned, give me your hands.

09:03.528 --> 09:04.730
I'd rather not.

09:04.755 --> 09:05.690
Gimme.

09:10.805 --> 09:12.187
Coming here, here we go.

09:12.212 --> 09:12.774
Ow!

09:12.799 --> 09:13.547
Hold still.

09:13.572 --> 09:14.032
Ow.

09:14.057 --> 09:15.102
- Ok.
- Ow.

09:15.793 --> 09:17.850
This won't hurt a bit.

09:19.014 --> 09:21.770
You do not want to get this infected.

09:23.683 --> 09:25.152
Thank you.

09:25.177 --> 09:26.282
There you go.

09:26.605 --> 09:28.106
Right as rain.

09:28.483 --> 09:32.488
Well, you two certainly
make a good team.

09:36.896 --> 09:38.233
Hello?

09:41.460 --> 09:43.063
Florence?

09:50.935 --> 09:55.638
_

10:02.729 --> 10:06.273
Well, it's ten to 4:00, there's
a crowd gathering outside.

10:06.367 --> 10:09.565
Our little town is about to change.

10:09.590 --> 10:11.946
Oh, I'm not sure that's
such a good thing.

10:12.509 --> 10:14.745
Oh, come on, Bill.

10:14.770 --> 10:16.810
There must be some part of
you that's excited about

10:16.835 --> 10:18.662
bringing the telephone here.

10:18.917 --> 10:20.754
A very small part.

10:25.524 --> 10:27.170
Hello?

10:27.195 --> 10:28.178
Hi Elizabeth.

10:28.203 --> 10:28.748
Hi.

10:28.773 --> 10:30.611
We're closing early to
hear the telephone ring.

10:30.636 --> 10:31.616
Isn't it exciting?

10:31.648 --> 10:32.522
It is.

10:32.547 --> 10:34.000
Do you have Jack Junior?

10:34.032 --> 10:35.871
Oh, Molly has him, remember?

10:35.896 --> 10:36.897
Today was supposed to be her day.

10:36.922 --> 10:38.389
It was, but I thought
she had an appointment

10:38.414 --> 10:39.983
at the hair salon in Benson Hills.

10:40.008 --> 10:41.935
She did but when she came
back she saw Florence come in

10:41.960 --> 10:44.436
with the baby so she took him.

10:45.179 --> 10:46.181
Alright.

10:46.206 --> 10:47.951
I didn't realize that was the plan.

10:48.296 --> 10:49.928
I'm sorry, neither did I.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.783
Um, but I'm sure she'll be at the event.

10:51.808 --> 10:52.609
Great.

10:52.634 --> 10:54.104
Thank you.

11:02.801 --> 11:05.665
Alright, so when Bill
and Abigail come out,

11:05.690 --> 11:07.792
that's when we'll begin to
play just as we practised.

11:07.817 --> 11:11.248
Well, perhaps Hickam you could
play a little bit better

11:11.273 --> 11:12.474
than when we practised.

11:12.499 --> 11:13.467
Great.

11:13.492 --> 11:14.594
Ok.

11:14.619 --> 11:15.954
Ready?

11:17.155 --> 11:18.326
Carson. Henry.

11:18.351 --> 11:19.253
Lee.

11:23.229 --> 11:24.684
You seem happy.

11:25.048 --> 11:26.717
I am.

11:26.742 --> 11:28.230
What's going on?

11:29.379 --> 11:31.646
I bought a parcel of land today.

11:31.767 --> 11:32.717
Really?

11:32.742 --> 11:35.803
Yeah. It's not much but it's all mine.

11:35.828 --> 11:38.074
I just finished signing the papers.

11:38.432 --> 11:39.678
You didn't tell me.

11:39.703 --> 11:42.740
Well, I wanted it to be a surprise.

11:43.182 --> 11:44.647
It is.

11:45.116 --> 11:46.256
You're a land owner.

11:46.281 --> 11:47.650
I know.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.252
There you are.

11:58.277 --> 11:59.709
He was such a good boy.

11:59.734 --> 12:00.803
<i>Good.</i>

12:00.828 --> 12:02.347
<i>I missed you.</i>

12:02.372 --> 12:03.891
<i>Mama's here.</i>

12:05.138 --> 12:07.437
<i>Here they come. Here they come.</i>

12:19.326 --> 12:20.763
Ok, quiet everyone.

12:20.788 --> 12:21.349
Quiet down.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.143
We wanna hear the call.

12:26.547 --> 12:28.183
Are we ready, Ned?

12:32.704 --> 12:35.306
Alright, in 20 seconds.

12:39.760 --> 12:46.183
In ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,

12:46.208 --> 12:50.512
four, three, two, one!

12:56.414 --> 12:58.149
What's going on?

12:58.848 --> 13:01.381
Well perhaps Bill's
watch is a little fast.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.911
Shhh! Hang on, just-it'll ring.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.896
Oh.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.648
Apparently, it's not
happening today, folks.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.576
I'm-I'm so sorry.

13:23.309 --> 13:24.361
Thank you, Molly.

13:24.386 --> 13:25.855
Oh, any time.

13:27.282 --> 13:29.113
Oh dear.

13:32.938 --> 13:33.910
Mrs. Stenton.

13:33.935 --> 13:34.800
Yes, Robert?

13:34.825 --> 13:35.730
It's for you.

13:35.755 --> 13:37.746
Oh. Hello?

13:37.771 --> 13:39.173
<i>What's going on, mom?</i>

13:42.192 --> 13:43.928
Hello, Cody!

13:56.471 --> 13:57.840
Come in.

13:59.347 --> 14:00.949
Oh, I'm sorry, did I wake you?

14:00.974 --> 14:02.183
No, no. It's ok.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.183
Besides, it's time to get ready.

14:04.208 --> 14:05.042
I can come back.

14:05.067 --> 14:06.488
No, no, no.

14:06.903 --> 14:08.373
The book.

14:08.398 --> 14:10.230
Do you want me to hold
little Jack for you?

14:10.255 --> 14:11.601
Thank you.

14:12.456 --> 14:13.924
Did you get to bed last night?

14:13.949 --> 14:15.084
No.

14:15.109 --> 14:18.214
Mr. Fussypants had a rather rough night.

14:18.487 --> 14:23.097
But there was a lot of walking
and feeding and singing.

14:23.390 --> 14:25.192
Have you read Pride and Prejudice yet?

14:25.217 --> 14:26.363
Not yet.

14:26.388 --> 14:27.994
Oh, you're gonna love it.

14:29.354 --> 14:30.997
He's so cute.

14:31.022 --> 14:32.872
<i>And he has a strong grip.</i>

14:33.624 --> 14:35.091
Here you go.

14:35.351 --> 14:37.836
You always were quite the reader.

14:38.893 --> 14:40.630
I love the women in these books.

14:41.474 --> 14:43.610
Laura, I remember you saying
you wanted to go to college.

14:43.635 --> 14:45.070
I do.

14:45.095 --> 14:47.130
I mean, I did.

14:47.155 --> 14:49.157
My dad says college is for city folk.

14:49.182 --> 14:50.761
Not people like us.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.542
I don't think that's true.

14:52.567 --> 14:54.102
We don't have the money.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.363
Besides, my job really helps out,

14:56.388 --> 14:57.839
even though it's only part time.

14:57.872 --> 14:59.324
I understand, but at a certain
point you're gonna have

14:59.349 --> 15:01.224
to start thinking about your future.

15:01.249 --> 15:02.552
I know.

15:02.577 --> 15:03.480
Some day.

15:05.524 --> 15:06.659
Good morning.

15:06.684 --> 15:08.637
Good morning, Mrs. Sullivan.

15:09.101 --> 15:11.925
So, when was the last time he ate?

15:11.950 --> 15:14.136
Oh, about 4:00 in the morning.

15:14.161 --> 15:17.253
Oh, well that would explain
why you look so...

15:18.496 --> 15:20.295
So...?

15:22.012 --> 15:25.956
Why don't we check your diaper, hmm?

15:26.376 --> 15:27.762
Hello. Hello.

15:27.787 --> 15:29.481
Oh, it's ok.

15:34.504 --> 15:36.169
Did you get a hold of
the telephone company?

15:36.194 --> 15:37.457
I just got a wire.

15:37.482 --> 15:39.411
They're sending someone
to fix the problem.

15:39.650 --> 15:42.088
Woah, woah, woah, what's this?

15:42.267 --> 15:44.203
Tom?

15:44.665 --> 15:46.864
Why are you selling the saloon?

15:47.290 --> 15:49.449
Family's gotta come first.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.409
How soon are you looking to sell?

15:51.893 --> 15:53.663
As soon as possible.

15:58.765 --> 16:01.086
I've slung my last beer.

16:02.496 --> 16:04.430
My throat suddenly got parched.

16:04.455 --> 16:06.257
Funny how that happens.

16:06.282 --> 16:07.550
He's leaving a good thing here.

16:07.575 --> 16:08.927
No kidding.

16:09.228 --> 16:11.064
A business like this could go belly-up.

16:11.089 --> 16:12.724
Oh yeah, in the blink of an eye.

16:13.287 --> 16:15.322
So you're both thinking of buying it.

16:15.347 --> 16:16.181
What?

16:16.206 --> 16:17.508
No.

16:19.656 --> 16:20.323
Carson.

16:20.348 --> 16:21.817
Abigail.

16:22.675 --> 16:24.444
Oh, Carson!

16:24.469 --> 16:26.941
You're just the person
I've been looking for.

16:26.966 --> 16:29.261
Lee and I are having a dinner
party tonight, you're invited.

16:29.286 --> 16:30.508
Can you make it?

16:30.533 --> 16:32.716
Uh, yeah.

16:32.741 --> 16:33.610
Sure.

16:33.635 --> 16:34.369
Wonderful.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.778
6:00, don't be late, and, well,

16:36.938 --> 16:38.506
wear something nice.

16:39.095 --> 16:40.330
Ok.

16:44.922 --> 16:47.325
Lee, you uh, you have a minute?

16:47.350 --> 16:48.557
Yeah, sure Henry.

16:48.582 --> 16:50.176
What's going on?

16:50.544 --> 16:55.294
Well, first of all I
just-I'd like to thank you

16:55.319 --> 16:58.310
for the opportunities
you've given me here.

16:59.921 --> 17:01.419
You're not leaving, are you?

17:01.444 --> 17:04.458
Well, I suppose that depends
on how this conversation goes.

17:04.483 --> 17:05.859
Ok.

17:06.527 --> 17:10.731
Well, I do appreciate the fact
that you took a risk on me when-

17:10.882 --> 17:12.699
when no one else would,

17:13.605 --> 17:16.114
and I hope that it's paid
off for you somehow.

17:16.138 --> 17:17.481
Oh, absolutely.

17:17.506 --> 17:20.310
You have been an excellent
manager, Henry.

17:20.413 --> 17:23.460
Well, I wonder if you might
consider taking another risk.

17:24.443 --> 17:25.979
Ok.

17:27.078 --> 17:28.739
You have my undivided attention.

17:28.764 --> 17:29.950
What's on your mind?

17:29.975 --> 17:33.395
Well, Tom is uh, selling the saloon.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.028
Yeah, I saw that.

17:35.708 --> 17:37.278
I'd like to buy it.

17:37.537 --> 17:40.519
He's asking $9,000 and I
have about half that.

17:40.985 --> 17:43.956
Ok, so you're asking me for a loan then?

17:43.981 --> 17:46.856
I'm asking if you'd come aboard with me.

17:46.881 --> 17:47.980
As partners?

17:48.005 --> 17:48.887
That's right.

17:48.912 --> 17:52.887
Henry, I... I don't know what to say.

17:52.912 --> 17:55.714
I'm flattered, but I'm a timber man.

17:55.739 --> 17:57.744
I don't know anything about
the saloon business.

17:57.769 --> 17:59.037
I know how to run things.

17:59.062 --> 18:00.965
I always kinda have.

18:00.990 --> 18:03.492
And I also know a good
value when I see it.

18:03.703 --> 18:06.051
This is the only saloon
in a growing town

18:06.076 --> 18:08.301
and I'm sure that we could do half again

18:08.326 --> 18:10.261
as well as Tom's done in there.

18:10.286 --> 18:13.231
Hmm. It's interesting.

18:13.256 --> 18:15.492
It's very, very interesting.

18:15.614 --> 18:17.411
But I would like to
consult with Rosemary

18:17.436 --> 18:20.099
before I start investing in a saloon.

18:20.392 --> 18:21.769
Of course.

18:22.077 --> 18:23.594
Would you mind if I spoke with her?

18:23.619 --> 18:24.721
Oh, sure.

18:24.746 --> 18:26.181
Be my guest.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.358
She does tend to do most
of the talking, though.

18:28.555 --> 18:31.862
Alright. Well, I'll be
prepared to listen.

18:31.990 --> 18:33.568
Good luck.

18:38.768 --> 18:39.833
Hi.

18:39.858 --> 18:40.614
Oh, hey Bill.

18:40.639 --> 18:41.740
Can I get you something to eat?

18:41.765 --> 18:44.416
No. No thanks, but we need to talk.

18:45.328 --> 18:47.531
Oh. Ok.

18:50.882 --> 18:54.176
I'm interested in selling
my share of the cafe.

18:55.582 --> 18:57.638
So you can buy the saloon.

18:58.607 --> 18:59.674
With what I've got,

18:59.699 --> 19:02.518
selling my share will get
me the nine grand I need.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.969
You don't like co-owning this cafe.

19:04.994 --> 19:05.776
No, no.

19:05.801 --> 19:07.276
Abigail, you've been a great partner,

19:07.301 --> 19:10.815
it's just that I want to be
a sole owner, no offence.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.007
None taken.

19:12.032 --> 19:12.987
Good.

19:13.012 --> 19:15.283
Besides, I think a saloon
suits me a little better.

19:15.377 --> 19:16.721
Ok.

19:16.746 --> 19:19.784
But I can't buy you out right now, Bill.

19:20.525 --> 19:22.494
You can't or you won't?

19:22.519 --> 19:23.940
What's that supposed to mean?

19:23.965 --> 19:25.645
Well, you're friends with Henry.

19:25.670 --> 19:26.905
Maybe, it's just that you
don't want to get caught

19:26.930 --> 19:27.822
in the middle.

19:27.847 --> 19:29.994
I don't have the money to buy you out.

19:30.019 --> 19:31.554
But if I did, I would

19:31.579 --> 19:34.174
because I would like to
be a sole owner, too.

19:35.278 --> 19:36.968
No offence.

19:43.362 --> 19:44.375
Oh, ok.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.602
This is it.

19:47.044 --> 19:49.080
It's beautiful.

19:49.239 --> 19:51.610
I know it's not the best
parcel in Hope Valley.

19:51.635 --> 19:53.871
No, but it's all yours.

19:53.896 --> 19:56.195
How long have you been planning to buy?

19:56.877 --> 19:58.490
For a while.

19:58.592 --> 20:00.104
Why'd you keep it a secret?

20:00.129 --> 20:01.831
I told you, I wanted
it to be a surprise.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.370
And I wanted to make
sure I had enough cash.

20:04.567 --> 20:07.041
I don't wanna be one of those
guys who just talk big.

20:07.107 --> 20:09.501
I know you're not like that, Jesse.

20:09.724 --> 20:14.506
I wanna have horses and hogs and
maybe build our barn over here.

20:15.432 --> 20:16.901
Our barn?

20:19.805 --> 20:21.096
Of course.

20:21.121 --> 20:22.589
Our barn.

20:25.756 --> 20:28.270
What are you saying exactly, Jesse?

20:29.545 --> 20:33.025
I see a life with you.

20:34.719 --> 20:36.121
Are you asking me?

20:36.146 --> 20:37.781
It's gonna happen.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.989
Some day.

20:40.752 --> 20:41.753
Oh.

20:41.778 --> 20:42.881
Some day.

20:42.906 --> 20:44.243
Soon.

20:44.519 --> 20:46.355
I just wanna be in a better position,

20:46.380 --> 20:48.123
money-wise.

20:48.329 --> 20:50.465
And if it's ok with you I'm
gonna work really hard

20:50.490 --> 20:51.859
to get there.

20:54.852 --> 20:56.487
Are you ok with that?

20:57.486 --> 20:59.321
Mmmhmm.

21:07.976 --> 21:11.127
♪<i> And if that mocking bird won't sing,</i> ♪

21:11.152 --> 21:15.157

21:29.789 --> 21:31.223
You might have a different opinion

21:31.248 --> 21:32.792
if you saw me last night.

21:33.135 --> 21:35.228
Nothing I did worked.

21:35.253 --> 21:37.589
You are doing a wonderful
job with your son.

21:37.614 --> 21:39.007
I don't know.

21:39.486 --> 21:41.922
Yesterday was Molly's day and
then it became Florence's day

21:41.947 --> 21:43.916
and then Molly's day again.

21:43.941 --> 21:47.145
I am grateful for all
of the help, I just-

21:47.170 --> 21:49.016
Can't keep up that schedule.

21:50.268 --> 21:52.304
I just feel like I
need to provide my son

21:52.329 --> 21:54.431
with some stability in his life.

21:54.644 --> 21:55.878
You will.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.568
If there's one thing I know a
good mother always figures out

21:58.593 --> 22:00.068
what's best for her child.

22:00.564 --> 22:02.701
You really think I'm a good mother?

22:03.094 --> 22:04.022
No.

22:04.892 --> 22:06.834
I think you're a great mother.

22:23.004 --> 22:25.262
Hello, Leland Coulter.

22:25.440 --> 22:28.177
Sorry, you need how
big an order by when?

22:28.202 --> 22:30.154
Absolutely we can do that.

22:30.179 --> 22:31.029
Yes, of course.

22:31.054 --> 22:33.979
You know that thing
doesn't work yet, right?

22:34.897 --> 22:37.064
Just uh...

22:37.977 --> 22:39.902
What can I do for you, Bill?

22:40.164 --> 22:43.335
Lee, I've got a no-lose
proposition for you.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.823
This doesn't have anything to
do with the saloon, does it?

22:46.204 --> 22:47.158
How did you know?

22:47.183 --> 22:48.571
Henry's already been in here asking me

22:48.596 --> 22:50.021
if I would partner with him.

22:50.046 --> 22:51.818
Well, you're not considering it.

22:52.041 --> 22:53.694
Yeah, sure I was.

22:54.325 --> 22:58.429
Did he give you his "I'm a
natural born leader" speech?

22:58.550 --> 23:00.185
A variation of it, yes.

23:00.210 --> 23:01.631
Mmmhmm.

23:01.757 --> 23:05.638
Lee, the man has done very
well under your watchful eye,

23:05.663 --> 23:08.716
but he has a checkered past when
it comes to honesty and money.

23:08.741 --> 23:11.536
Yes, I know he's had his
ups and downs in the past

23:11.561 --> 23:15.020
but he's been a model employee for me.

23:15.891 --> 23:19.027
Well, it's a bit of a gamble
if you go with Henry.

23:19.052 --> 23:22.361
With me you kinda know
what you're gonna get.

23:23.215 --> 23:24.905
It's true.

23:25.374 --> 23:27.044
Listen, Bill, you're a friend

23:27.069 --> 23:29.909
so I'm gonna tell you what I told Henry.

23:31.038 --> 23:33.080
I have to talk to Rosemary first.

23:37.892 --> 23:40.269
Red and gold leaf would be so elegant.

23:40.294 --> 23:42.547
And a chandelier.

23:42.867 --> 23:44.035
From New York City.

23:46.286 --> 23:48.261
Making promises you can't keep again?

23:48.286 --> 23:50.931
If you'll excuse us, Bill,
we're just having a meeting.

23:50.956 --> 23:54.277
I just spoke with Lee and
he's considering me, too.

23:54.302 --> 23:57.199
So obviously the choice is clear.

23:57.224 --> 23:58.879
Yes, either the business man

23:58.904 --> 24:01.332
or the man who's never run a business.

24:01.378 --> 24:03.606
You say that as you're
eating in my cafe.

24:03.631 --> 24:05.597
Surely you mean Abigail's
as she's the one

24:05.622 --> 24:06.766
who does all the work.

24:06.791 --> 24:07.597
Now, now.

24:07.622 --> 24:10.363
I should hear what you both have to say.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.119
Bill?

24:12.514 --> 24:13.911
Thank you.

24:15.607 --> 24:20.311
So, you will notice that
Henry has promised to build

24:20.336 --> 24:22.644
a stage in the saloon.

24:22.669 --> 24:24.287
Of course I would be the headliner,

24:24.319 --> 24:28.259
music mostly, but the
occasional theatre performance.

24:29.728 --> 24:31.887
Bill, what are your plans?

24:37.730 --> 24:39.478
Well, I'd build a bigger stage.

24:40.335 --> 24:42.274
The saloon would have a new name,

24:42.299 --> 24:43.494
Rosemary's.

24:43.519 --> 24:47.570
Oh, well I do like the sound of that.

24:52.790 --> 24:55.494
Laura, how much is this?

24:55.519 --> 24:56.455
25 cents.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.587
<i>When I grow up I'm gonna make a real one</i>

24:58.612 --> 25:00.065
that drives really fast.

25:00.090 --> 25:01.338
How fast?

25:01.363 --> 25:03.188
60, 70 miles an hour.

25:03.213 --> 25:05.456
When I grow up I'm gonna design fashions

25:05.481 --> 25:07.120
that are worn around the world.

25:07.145 --> 25:09.714
<i>Maybe they could wear
your fashions in my cars.</i>

25:09.864 --> 25:10.866
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:11.734 --> 25:13.639
What do you wanna do when you grow up?

25:14.253 --> 25:15.807
I don't know.

25:15.832 --> 25:16.966
<i>May I please have some gum?</i>

25:17.066 --> 25:18.001
<i>Mmmhmm.</i>

25:18.026 --> 25:19.161
<i>That'll be a penny.</i>

25:19.265 --> 25:20.066
You want some?

25:20.091 --> 25:21.188
Sure.

25:21.384 --> 25:22.512
Hi Mrs. Thornton.

25:22.537 --> 25:23.862
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:24.323 --> 25:25.892
Can I help you with anything?

25:25.917 --> 25:27.252
Mm-mm.

25:36.261 --> 25:38.494
Hey sweetheart, I'm home.

25:38.519 --> 25:40.120
I'm so glad you're here.

25:40.145 --> 25:40.713
<i>Hi.</i>

25:40.754 --> 25:44.099
Bill and Henry have grand
plans for the saloon.

25:44.124 --> 25:45.526
Oh no.

25:45.738 --> 25:47.539
What did they offer you?

25:47.564 --> 25:48.599
What does that mean?

25:48.750 --> 25:51.353
I didn't think you'd be
keen on this idea at all

25:51.378 --> 25:52.861
and now you're all excited.

25:52.886 --> 25:53.846
Come on.

25:53.871 --> 25:54.729
Lee Coulter,

25:54.754 --> 25:57.991
this is purely about a
sound business investment.

25:58.016 --> 25:59.151
It has nothing to do with me.

25:59.176 --> 26:00.603
Mmmhmm.

26:01.092 --> 26:03.227
A stage and my name on the saloon.

26:03.252 --> 26:04.206
A-ha!

26:04.231 --> 26:05.733
But that's neither here nor there.

26:05.758 --> 26:07.692
I think Bill is the better choice.

26:07.717 --> 26:09.026
Really?

26:09.179 --> 26:11.195
I'm kinda leaning towards Henry myself.

26:11.220 --> 26:13.782
Lee, he's still on parole.

26:13.807 --> 26:15.409
Well at least he knows
how to run a business.

26:16.481 --> 26:18.327
And our dinner party is about to start.

26:18.352 --> 26:20.722
What you would call a party
others might call an ambush.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.783
Only the most unromantic amongst us,

26:22.808 --> 26:24.144
which I know is not you.

26:24.169 --> 26:25.168
Fix your cuffs.

26:25.193 --> 26:26.503
Aargh.

26:26.908 --> 26:27.854
Come in.

26:27.879 --> 26:28.330
Hello.

26:28.355 --> 26:28.987
Thank you.

26:29.012 --> 26:29.980
Hey Carson.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.882
Hey.

26:31.907 --> 26:33.142
Am I early?

26:33.167 --> 26:34.845
No, you're right on time.

26:36.905 --> 26:38.974
Can I uh, fix you a drink, or-

26:38.999 --> 26:41.058
No, I'm fine.

26:41.083 --> 26:42.418
Thanks.

26:42.564 --> 26:43.686
Ok.

26:43.711 --> 26:47.815
Well, it's a beautiful
evening, isn't it?

26:48.022 --> 26:49.568
It is.

26:49.923 --> 26:51.091
Mmmhmm.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.246
Oh. I'll get that.

26:57.601 --> 26:59.369
I wonder who that could be.

26:59.655 --> 27:00.623
Faith.

27:00.648 --> 27:01.649
Hello.

27:01.674 --> 27:03.110
Come in.

27:04.500 --> 27:05.682
Am I early?

27:05.707 --> 27:07.752
No, you're right on time.

27:07.777 --> 27:10.505
Well, here we all are.

27:10.973 --> 27:13.743
Well, Lee and I have found
with bigger parties

27:13.768 --> 27:17.386
we don't get a chance to
truly visit with our guests.

27:20.110 --> 27:21.947
Whatever you're cooking smells great.

27:21.972 --> 27:23.695
Why don't you help me in the kitchen?

27:23.720 --> 27:25.145
Ok.

27:34.973 --> 27:35.989
Tom?

27:36.014 --> 27:37.016
Sheriff.

27:37.916 --> 27:39.684
Last minute packing?

27:39.709 --> 27:40.911
Yeah.

27:40.936 --> 27:44.030
I didn't know you served this whiskey.

27:44.055 --> 27:46.995
That's 'cause that was
reserved for the big tippers.

27:47.331 --> 27:49.585
Well, I got a tip for you.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.713
I'm working at meeting
your asking price.

27:52.738 --> 27:54.190
You're not the only one interested.

27:54.215 --> 27:55.382
I know that.

27:55.965 --> 27:57.699
I'm just asking for a little more time.

27:57.724 --> 27:59.792
Well, you have until tomorrow.

27:59.817 --> 28:01.182
Sorry.

28:01.207 --> 28:03.225
I gotta get back to my family.

28:03.514 --> 28:08.319
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a lot to do.

28:17.261 --> 28:19.846
Mmm, this chicken is delicious.

28:19.871 --> 28:21.643
Well, thank you, Carson.

28:21.668 --> 28:24.487
Lee always says there's
nothing like home cooking.

28:24.512 --> 28:25.856
Isn't that right, Lee?

28:25.881 --> 28:27.338
Mmmhmm.

28:27.508 --> 28:28.331
Right.

28:28.356 --> 28:29.525
Nothing.

28:29.550 --> 28:31.628
Mmm.

28:35.521 --> 28:38.213
Every woman has their
own family recipes.

28:38.238 --> 28:40.011
What are some of yours, Faith?

28:40.036 --> 28:43.139
Oh, actually I don't cook a lick.

28:43.364 --> 28:45.878
Sometimes I'll warm a can of beans

28:45.903 --> 28:50.315
or I'll go out and grab a
bite but usually beans.

28:50.340 --> 28:52.857
They're pretty nutritious.

28:55.917 --> 28:58.901
Well, this woman certainly
knows her nutrition.

28:58.926 --> 29:00.162
Yeah.

29:02.058 --> 29:05.662
Beans don't agree with me so much.

29:08.862 --> 29:10.997
It's funny that you should say "agree"

29:11.022 --> 29:12.815
because that is one of the things I love

29:12.840 --> 29:14.587
the most about being married.

29:14.786 --> 29:15.925
What do you mean?

29:15.950 --> 29:18.254
You always have someone
who will agree with you.

29:21.550 --> 29:23.119
Even when you're wrong?

29:23.144 --> 29:25.613
Oh, Carson, I'm never wrong.

29:25.881 --> 29:29.819
Because Lee loves me so much,
isn't that right, Lee?

29:29.844 --> 29:31.114
That's right, yeah.

29:31.139 --> 29:32.026
I do.

29:32.051 --> 29:35.065
But, you know, sometimes you do kinda...

29:35.090 --> 29:36.615
go in the wrong direction.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.272
But we always work it out.

29:38.798 --> 29:40.468
What do you mean?

29:41.183 --> 29:44.354
Uh, well, like the saloon
investment, for example.

29:44.379 --> 29:46.876
I don't think you made the
right choice on that one.

29:46.901 --> 29:48.151
Of course I did.

29:48.176 --> 29:49.145
And we decided.

29:49.170 --> 29:50.139
No.

29:50.164 --> 29:51.505
<i>No, no, no, we didn't.</i>

29:51.530 --> 29:53.751
<i>We're still talking about that one.</i>

29:54.331 --> 29:56.613
He'll agree.

29:57.140 --> 29:58.007
No.

29:58.032 --> 30:00.002
No, I don't think he will.

30:10.422 --> 30:11.868
So that was...

30:11.893 --> 30:12.862
Something.

30:13.956 --> 30:16.360
Yes, that was something alright.

30:16.385 --> 30:19.017
I didn't know about any of this.

30:19.042 --> 30:20.454
Neither did I.

30:20.479 --> 30:22.716
It's like we were caught
in Rosemary's web.

30:22.741 --> 30:24.076
And there was no escaping it.

30:24.122 --> 30:25.275
Exactly.

30:27.527 --> 30:31.321
I mean, trying to set
us up as a couple...

30:31.346 --> 30:32.315
Yeah.

30:32.340 --> 30:34.208
Can you imagine?

30:37.289 --> 30:40.923
I mean, doesn't she realize
how ridiculous that would be?

30:43.266 --> 30:44.801
Yeah.

30:44.826 --> 30:46.173
What was she thinking?

30:46.198 --> 30:47.233
Right.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.417
<i>He said some day he wants to marry you?</i>

30:51.442 --> 30:54.657
He never said the word but he
said he sees a life with me.

30:54.682 --> 30:56.471
Clara, he has to say the words.

30:56.496 --> 30:58.023
I know.

30:58.420 --> 31:00.439
He just wants to be
in a better position,

31:00.464 --> 31:01.819
money-wise.

31:02.946 --> 31:06.083
But I do feel like he's not
telling me everything.

31:06.108 --> 31:08.544
Well, if he's willing
to talk about marriage

31:08.569 --> 31:12.441
then don't be afraid to ask him
to talk about other things.

31:17.388 --> 31:19.867
Is the telephone representative
supposed to arrive today?

31:19.892 --> 31:21.060
That's what they said.

31:21.085 --> 31:25.062
Still seems odd, that a voice
can travel so far so fast.

31:25.087 --> 31:26.091
Modern times.

31:26.116 --> 31:27.985
I think we have to be
ready for anything.

31:28.010 --> 31:29.046
Hmm.

31:41.588 --> 31:44.517
Hello, I'm looking for Mayor Stanton.

31:44.856 --> 31:46.114
You found her.

31:46.421 --> 31:47.655
Swell.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.316
Fiona Miller.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.786
I'm here to fix your switchboard.

32:10.266 --> 32:12.009
It's a beautiful day.

32:12.084 --> 32:13.766
Is it, Lee?

32:18.819 --> 32:20.144
Excuse me.

32:20.169 --> 32:21.982
Certainly.

32:26.730 --> 32:28.249
Tom.

32:28.614 --> 32:31.884
I hope to be able to finalize
a deal in the next day or so.

32:31.963 --> 32:33.566
I gotta be honest with ya.

32:33.591 --> 32:34.874
I got another interested buyer.

32:34.899 --> 32:36.034
I know, I know.

32:36.059 --> 32:37.161
Ok.

32:37.186 --> 32:39.546
Well, if you want it you
better get the cash together

32:39.571 --> 32:41.573
in the next couple of hours.

32:57.111 --> 32:59.047
- Sweetheart.
- Sweetie.

32:59.072 --> 33:00.499
This is silly.

33:00.524 --> 33:03.561
You don't have to agree
with me all the time.

33:03.777 --> 33:06.014
The great majority of
the time is enough.

33:06.039 --> 33:07.538
We can't let this come between us.

33:07.563 --> 33:08.698
No, we won't allow it.

33:08.723 --> 33:10.280
No, we won't.

33:11.746 --> 33:13.413
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

33:13.438 --> 33:15.372
I think I am thinking
what you're thinking,

33:15.397 --> 33:17.099
and I couldn't agree more.

33:17.133 --> 33:20.436
And with that the world is right again.

33:21.115 --> 33:22.366
I love you.

33:22.391 --> 33:23.952
I love you.

33:24.251 --> 33:25.530
Ok.

33:25.563 --> 33:27.717
What do you think the problem could be?

33:27.929 --> 33:29.765
Who was working the switchboard?

33:29.790 --> 33:31.158
Ned Yost.

33:31.183 --> 33:33.189
Has he worked with a telephone before?

33:33.214 --> 33:34.788
Just the telegraph.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.449
Then it's him.

33:37.454 --> 33:38.656
Ladies.

33:42.253 --> 33:44.773
What did I tell you?

33:47.423 --> 33:50.113
Scandalous, hmph.

33:50.554 --> 33:52.890
Something's got to be broken.

33:58.651 --> 34:01.348
Oh, what have you done?

34:01.377 --> 34:04.324
Do you know how long
it took me to do this?

34:04.349 --> 34:06.712
Long enough to make a
real mess of things.

34:07.495 --> 34:09.496
Well, I'll leave you to it.

34:09.663 --> 34:12.112
Laura, Mrs. Thornton is
expecting a telegram.

34:12.138 --> 34:13.635
Did it arrive?

34:13.934 --> 34:15.268
Nothing yet.

34:15.293 --> 34:16.996
I'll let her know.

34:23.225 --> 34:24.592
Bill!

34:24.618 --> 34:26.020
Come in.

34:26.246 --> 34:27.983
Good news.

34:34.857 --> 34:37.360
So, Lee and I have discussed the saloon

34:37.386 --> 34:39.539
and we have come to a decision.

34:39.563 --> 34:40.360
We have.

34:40.386 --> 34:42.110
We are not going to enter
into a partnership

34:42.136 --> 34:43.516
with either one of you.

34:43.542 --> 34:46.295
We can't agree as a couple,
so we won't do it.

34:46.321 --> 34:47.141
Right.

34:47.167 --> 34:48.447
This is your good news?

34:48.472 --> 34:53.344
Well, the good news is we have
figured out another solution.

34:53.370 --> 34:54.400
We have.

34:54.425 --> 34:56.974
Henry, you told me you had
about half the money.

34:56.998 --> 34:59.033
Bill, you have half the money.

34:59.058 --> 35:00.794
Together that makes a whole.

35:00.819 --> 35:02.305
We think the two of you

35:02.330 --> 35:04.687
should enter into a
partnership together.

35:04.977 --> 35:06.545
Is this a joke?

35:06.570 --> 35:07.913
No. No, it's no joke.

35:07.938 --> 35:10.233
We think it's a great idea.

35:10.738 --> 35:13.998
Well, you know, Bill and I, we uh,

35:14.023 --> 35:15.572
we rarely agree on anything.

35:15.597 --> 35:18.016
Oh, but you both agreed
to make me the headliner,

35:18.041 --> 35:21.878
which still stands as a
truly inspired idea.

35:21.903 --> 35:24.171
Yeah, but I just don't think Henry and I

35:24.196 --> 35:25.990
may partner well together.

35:26.015 --> 35:27.750
Maybe, it's possible.

35:27.775 --> 35:29.966
Or maybe you each have unique skill sets

35:29.991 --> 35:32.423
that would compliment one another.

35:41.559 --> 35:46.105
Oh, you'll get a splinter
without gloves, my dear.

35:46.418 --> 35:48.207
I'll be fine.

35:48.921 --> 35:50.777
Did I do something wrong?

35:51.327 --> 35:55.237
Not wrong but maybe not right.

35:55.975 --> 35:58.324
Yeah, I don't understand.

35:59.264 --> 36:01.867
You talk about some day
wanting a life with me

36:01.892 --> 36:03.861
but that money is a concern.

36:03.886 --> 36:04.871
It's true.

36:04.981 --> 36:07.666
But you already have a
good job at the sawmill.

36:08.061 --> 36:09.130
I do.

36:09.155 --> 36:12.019
Jesse, if you really see a life with me

36:12.044 --> 36:15.091
I need you to be more
open about the obstacles.

36:15.456 --> 36:18.326
I just have some things to work out.

36:18.351 --> 36:20.221
And I will.

36:22.524 --> 36:24.057
That's it?

36:24.694 --> 36:26.560
<i>That's all you're gonna tell me?</i>

36:27.775 --> 36:31.780
I'm asking you to trust me.

36:48.389 --> 36:50.957
<i>You've gotta connect the cord circuits</i>

36:50.993 --> 36:53.545
with the line circuit, right?

36:53.871 --> 36:57.308
Maybe the battery to the
mayor's office isn't working.

36:57.333 --> 36:59.106
The battery is fine.

36:59.131 --> 37:01.785
Then maybe it's the wires
connecting the batteries.

37:01.810 --> 37:03.178
You know how you could help?

37:03.203 --> 37:04.205
How?

37:04.230 --> 37:06.309
I could really use a cold soda.

37:06.954 --> 37:08.195
Certainly.

37:08.220 --> 37:10.353
Coming up.

37:13.288 --> 37:15.091
<i>I figure we could reopen tomorrow.</i>

37:15.116 --> 37:16.611
I see no reason to wait.

37:16.636 --> 37:18.272
I know a place in Union City

37:18.297 --> 37:19.860
where we could get a
better quality of beer.

37:19.885 --> 37:21.345
I wanna see the receipts.

37:21.370 --> 37:23.617
It'll all be on the up and up.

37:25.551 --> 37:27.254
You both know I'm closed, right?

37:27.279 --> 37:28.447
Nine grand.

37:28.472 --> 37:29.456
Count it.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.249
We met your asking price.

37:31.274 --> 37:32.376
You're too late.

37:32.428 --> 37:34.754
I just sold it for ten
grand five minutes ago.

37:34.897 --> 37:36.005
What?

37:36.687 --> 37:38.925
I told you I had another
person interested.

37:38.952 --> 37:40.338
I thought you were talking about Henry.

37:40.363 --> 37:41.998
I thought you were talking about Bill.

37:42.023 --> 37:44.228
Well, you both thought wrong.

37:44.253 --> 37:45.421
Who did you sell it to?

37:45.480 --> 37:47.349
An out-of-town buyer.

37:47.762 --> 37:49.935
He wired me the money.

37:59.063 --> 38:00.820
- Hi Laura.
- Hi.

38:00.845 --> 38:03.148
I was wondering if a telegram
had come for me yet.

38:03.173 --> 38:04.309
Mr. Yost brought some in.

38:04.334 --> 38:05.743
Let me see.

38:06.185 --> 38:08.245
Yep, there's one.

38:10.076 --> 38:11.445
Thank you.

38:16.967 --> 38:18.161
Great news.

38:18.186 --> 38:19.788
How would you like to
earn enough money to help

38:19.813 --> 38:22.216
your father and go to
preparatory school?

38:22.351 --> 38:24.177
I'm sorry, Mrs. Thornton.

38:24.250 --> 38:26.012
What are you saying?

38:26.520 --> 38:28.433
I have a friend who's the administrator

38:28.458 --> 38:30.224
of a prep school in Hamilton.

38:30.249 --> 38:32.985
I wired your grades
and my recommendation

38:33.010 --> 38:37.567
and you've been accepted as
a correspondent student.

38:41.168 --> 38:43.715
Between working here and helping my dad

38:43.986 --> 38:46.116
I don't think I have time for that.

38:46.536 --> 38:49.619
What if you came to work as my nanny?

38:50.026 --> 38:52.596
It's full time so you'd make
more money than you would here

38:52.621 --> 38:55.357
and you could do your school
work while Jack naps,

38:55.382 --> 38:57.385
which happens pretty frequently.

39:02.114 --> 39:05.051
If you'd like to stay
working here, that's fine.

39:05.265 --> 39:08.806
Either way it's just a really
good opportunity for you.

39:12.280 --> 39:14.149
What do you think, Laura?

39:18.190 --> 39:20.736
Yes to prep school.

39:21.442 --> 39:22.744
Yes to being your nanny.

39:24.337 --> 39:26.018
Thank you so much.

39:26.043 --> 39:28.880
Believe me, you're helping
me more than you know.

39:36.855 --> 39:38.190
There you are.

39:38.215 --> 39:39.182
I was looking for you.

39:39.207 --> 39:40.504
Hi.

39:40.836 --> 39:42.938
Ooh, those look delicious.

39:42.971 --> 39:44.453
I'm sure they are.

39:44.638 --> 39:46.373
You've got quite the green thumb.

39:46.508 --> 39:48.878
Abigail's the one with the green thumb.

39:52.291 --> 39:56.614
You ever hear that expression
"you reap what you sew"?

39:56.814 --> 39:58.383
Yes.

40:00.677 --> 40:04.382
Well, it applies to me, too.

40:06.461 --> 40:10.829
When I was young, me and some
guys broke into a general store

40:10.854 --> 40:12.792
and stole money from the safe.

40:13.539 --> 40:16.457
It was owned by this older man.

40:16.820 --> 40:19.667
The others I was with,
they all got away.

40:20.990 --> 40:23.005
I did not.

40:23.703 --> 40:26.518
I served my time and the
owner, he got my share back,

40:26.543 --> 40:29.844
but it wasn't a lot.

40:31.734 --> 40:33.436
And then last year I heard this owner,

40:33.461 --> 40:35.697
he was getting too old to run his store.

40:35.722 --> 40:37.395
He was struggling.

40:38.183 --> 40:43.733
So I've been sending him
$10 a month ever since.

40:46.468 --> 40:51.699
I don't wanna get married until
I pay him back every penny

40:52.645 --> 41:00.287
because I want us to start
our life with a clean slate.

41:09.024 --> 41:12.263
And we will reap all
that comes from that.

41:35.120 --> 41:36.450
Ok.

41:36.586 --> 41:38.763
Time to fire you up.

41:39.155 --> 41:41.157
<i>So how did your dinner
party go the other night?</i>

41:41.182 --> 41:43.151
Ugh. It was a disaster.

41:43.176 --> 41:43.974
Oh, Rosemary.

41:43.999 --> 41:45.378
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

41:45.403 --> 41:49.924
Try as I might I cannot bring
Carson and Faith together.

41:50.090 --> 41:52.845
Well, if it's meant to be it'll happen.

41:52.870 --> 41:53.945
Abigail.

41:53.970 --> 41:56.389
Fate doesn't always just happen.

41:56.414 --> 41:58.649
Sometimes you have to tempt it.

42:00.771 --> 42:02.506
Do you hear that?

42:02.680 --> 42:04.772
I think it's coming from your office.

42:04.825 --> 42:06.224
She did it!

42:12.702 --> 42:14.504
Everyone! Everyone!

42:14.529 --> 42:17.396
Gather around, the telephone is ringing!

42:17.421 --> 42:18.931
Oh my. It works!

42:18.956 --> 42:21.623
It certainly does.

42:22.193 --> 42:24.396
Are you gonna answer it?

42:24.844 --> 42:27.587
Oh, right.

42:30.032 --> 42:31.367
Hello?

42:31.392 --> 42:33.591
Mayor Stanton, the senior vice president

42:33.616 --> 42:37.513
of telephone operations wishes
to have a word with you.

42:38.329 --> 42:41.192
<i>Hello, Mayor Stanton, can you hear me?</i>

42:41.217 --> 42:43.394
I can hear you loud and clear.
