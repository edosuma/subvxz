<i> In the criminal justice system,</i>
<i> the people are represented</i>

00:04.238 --> 00:06.572
<i> by two separate</i>
<i> yet equally important groups:</i>

00:06.574 --> 00:08.440
<i> The police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:08.442 --> 00:11.210
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:11.212 --> 00:14.013
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:17.785 --> 00:21.353
Bypass triage.
Straight to E.R.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.522
Exam room 6.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.090
Exam room 3.

00:25.092 --> 00:27.259
Don't forget
your paperwork.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.430
Exam room 5, please.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.502
Gunshot wounds
<i> before</i> sprained ankles.

00:36.504 --> 00:39.171
Go on, sit down. Go on.

00:39.173 --> 00:43.042
Rhonda, Luther Vandross--
next week at the Garden.

00:43.044 --> 00:45.377
Oh, Lucas, your mother's
going to love that.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.146
You're missing
something wonderful.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.248
I know. The concert.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.649
Did you send me
a myocardial?

00:50.651 --> 00:53.118
Who else is
going to send him?

00:53.120 --> 00:55.287
He's got indigestion.
Not for two days,
he don't.

00:55.289 --> 00:59.191
Run back there and
stick him on an E.K.G.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.559
Now!

01:19.146 --> 01:20.512
Rhonda!

01:25.319 --> 01:27.152
Oh, my God.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.223
Call the code.

01:31.225 --> 01:34.460
Dr. Orton, exam area stat.
Code blue, E.R.

01:34.462 --> 01:35.627
Code blue, E.R.

01:35.629 --> 01:38.097
Dr. Orton, exam area stat.

01:38.099 --> 01:42.167
Let's move it.
Get Dr. Barg.

01:47.108 --> 01:49.174
This baby's stone-cold.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.512
(<i> sighs</i> )

02:01.489 --> 02:03.322
Phil.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.894
Somebody left the box
after 10:30 janitor's
last sweep.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.596
You got a perfect I.D.,
right?

02:10.598 --> 02:14.266
Yeah. I saw a white guy
put the box down at 11:00.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.435
I saw a woman
put it at 10:30.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.337
She was tall, he was a midget.

02:18.339 --> 02:21.140
We got prints off the box--
maybe we'll get lucky.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.474
The body's ready to pick up.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.510
What do you think, Doc?

02:24.512 --> 02:26.712
I'm an intern,
not a pathologist.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.213
Hazard a guess.

02:28.215 --> 02:30.315
I've been in E.R. for a week.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.651
Don't quote me.
He froze to death.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.354
CERRETA:
That doesn't make sense.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.623
This is a clean,
well-dressed baby,

02:37.625 --> 02:39.324
not a homeless kid.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.325
How do you know?

02:40.327 --> 02:41.560
You can't keep

02:41.562 --> 02:43.562
a kid clean without a home.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.398
Otherwise healthy,
no signs of exposure.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.300
They must have been covered.

02:48.302 --> 02:51.236
What's a kid like that
doing out in the cold?

02:51.238 --> 02:54.239
What's any kid doing
out in the cold?

02:57.244 --> 03:01.346
  Captioning sponsored by
  NBC/Universal

04:17.591 --> 04:19.591
No babies are
reported missing.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.693
The prints on the box
were partials.
And smudged.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.929
Don't they take
babies' footprints?

04:23.931 --> 04:26.565
They put them
on birth certificates.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.800
Hospital keeps them
a couple of months,

04:28.802 --> 04:30.535
then throws them away.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.738
Great. So somebody
walked in there,

04:32.740 --> 04:35.941
left a box with a baby in it,
and we got no witnesses.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.609
You don't go to the E.R.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.611
to watch the scenery.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.612
That baby was left
on the floor like trash.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.648
Nobody even noticed.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.916
You got a photo of the kid?

04:44.918 --> 04:47.919
Let's assume whoever left him
lives in the neighborhood.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.755
We could start
with day care.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.757
There's three churches,
two community centers.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.492
Talk about a haystack.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.494
It beats ringing every doorbell

04:55.496 --> 04:58.247
on the lower east side.

04:58.248 --> 05:00.999
Oh, yeah, we used to take babies
before the federal cutbacks.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.934
LOGAN:
What do you
call these?
Toddlers.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.904
So you tell me--
better to pay

05:05.906 --> 05:09.775
for a few more fighter planes
or to take care of kids?

05:09.777 --> 05:11.777
What about the churches?

05:11.779 --> 05:13.912
There is St. Julia's
on East 12th.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.881
They<i> had</i> a day care
for babies.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.016
Let me ask you
something.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.719
Do you know a woman
who doesn't work?

05:20.721 --> 05:22.521
What are we supposed to do

05:22.523 --> 05:24.589
with our kids?

05:24.591 --> 05:26.692
WOMAN:
Bye. I'll see you tomorrow.

05:26.694 --> 05:27.893
Okay.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.465
This kid asleep or dead?

05:33.467 --> 05:35.667
Do you recognize
the face?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.319
What a beautiful world.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.970
This the one they found
under the westside highway?

05:38.972 --> 05:41.940
Could you just look closer
at the picture, ma'am?

05:41.942 --> 05:45.811
We put them on a waiting list
at this age, but...

05:45.813 --> 05:47.746
I can't recognize a face.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.748
I got to check out
these kids.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.950
I turn around,
somebody will snatch

05:51.952 --> 05:53.452
one of them.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.753
What do we got?

05:54.755 --> 05:57.689
We got the baby, the box,
and the clothes.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.991
Let's check out
the bunny suit.

05:59.993 --> 06:03.695
CRAGEN:
<i> Okay, so where does that</i>
<i> leave us?</i>

06:03.697 --> 06:07.065
Bunny suits were manufactured
and shipped from Taiwan

06:07.067 --> 06:08.700
to a single wholesaler.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.802
It was last year's
big item.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.871
So, the one
the baby was wearing--

06:12.873 --> 06:14.473
was that new?

06:14.475 --> 06:17.809
Wholesaler had 30 cartons left
from last season.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.512
Went to a job lot guy
on Warren Street.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.081
Job lot shipped 20 cartons
all over Jersey.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.716
One carton each

06:24.718 --> 06:26.918
to ten different stores
in the city

06:26.920 --> 06:28.987
three to the lower east side.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.756
A dozen suits to a box.

06:30.758 --> 06:33.658
Down from a thousand doorbells
to ten stores-- that's progress.

06:33.660 --> 06:37.662
Unless, of course,
it's a gift from
an aunt in Jersey.

06:37.664 --> 06:38.764
It's unbelievable.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.866
The lady
at the church asks

06:40.868 --> 06:43.735
"Is this the one
from the westside highway?"

06:43.737 --> 06:44.836
This wants to know

06:44.838 --> 06:47.706
if this is the kid
from battery park.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.875
How many kids died
this weekend?

06:49.877 --> 06:52.611
Well, we got one more store
down here.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.613
This baby I don't remember.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.681
Wait, wait!
Wait a minute!

06:56.683 --> 06:57.682
Come on.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.151
You looked
at this picture

06:59.153 --> 07:00.886
all of two seconds.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.154
Take a good look.

07:02.156 --> 07:03.722
You had one carton.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.790
Six blue, six pink?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.825
You sure
he didn't get one?

07:06.827 --> 07:08.693
You remember the lady.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.061
No, I don't, Fernando.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.597
FERNANDO:
She bought the playpen, right?

07:12.599 --> 07:14.065
We don't remember, Fernando.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.700
Nothing.

07:15.702 --> 07:19.571
You know, we got a baby
that's frozen to death.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.106
I don't need your attitude.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.808
What about the playpen?

07:22.810 --> 07:24.643
I took it home for her.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.612
3rd Street between A and B,
two flights.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.182
She said she was sorry
she couldn't tip me.

07:30.184 --> 07:31.183
3rd Street?

07:31.185 --> 07:32.851
Do you remember the number?

07:32.853 --> 07:36.087
No. A lot of iron gates
on both sides.

07:36.089 --> 07:39.558
Tenement. Real pit.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.892
Thank you.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.831
LOGAN:
<i> You understand what I'm saying?</i>

07:45.833 --> 07:48.133
The woman with the baby, okay?

07:48.135 --> 07:49.768
<i> Hermana.</i>

07:49.770 --> 07:50.969
No, that's sister.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.971
<i> Hermana y ni√±o--</i>
<i> como se llama?</i>

07:52.973 --> 07:53.972
Ward.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.073
Ward.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.942
First name.
<i> Primo, primo.</i>

07:56.944 --> 07:58.076
<i> Yo no se.</i>

07:58.078 --> 08:00.111
Want to try
for a description?

08:00.113 --> 08:02.981
I'm doing the best I can
with seventh grade Spanish.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.651
Ward<i> es</i> young, old?
<i> Blanca, negra?</i>

08:06.653 --> 08:09.888
<i> Si, negra.</i>
<i> Veinte, veinte y uno.</i>

08:09.890 --> 08:10.989
2-B.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.157
Black. 20, 21.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.959
She lives in 2-B.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.861
It's a romance language.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.046
(<i> sighs</i> )

08:36.850 --> 08:39.684
(<i> wind whistling</i> )

08:39.686 --> 08:42.954
Leave me in this wind tunnel,
I'd freeze, too.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.723
Left in a hurry.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.091
They got out in a hurry.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.093
What are we looking at here?

08:48.095 --> 08:49.728
Crack-head?

08:49.730 --> 08:50.996
I don't know.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.231
Your guess
is as good as mine.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.936
The baby dies,
she dumps it,

08:57.938 --> 08:59.170
just clears out...

08:59.172 --> 09:01.873
like it was nothing.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.108
Anyone else home?

09:03.110 --> 09:04.743
<i> En casa?</i>

09:04.745 --> 09:05.977
The lady in 3-B.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.746
Fourth floor-- nobody.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.015
Oh, now you<i> habla ingles</i>
well, huh?

09:10.017 --> 09:12.984
No, no very good
English.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.819
<i> Vamos?</i>

09:18.992 --> 09:21.893
WOMAN:
<i> I don't know nobody named Ward</i>

09:21.895 --> 09:22.994
and I don't want to.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.663
She lives beneath you.

09:24.665 --> 09:27.198
I knew the lady
who lived there-- Mrs. Loftus.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.067
I didn't like her either.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.102
Noisy people
with a noisy baby--

09:31.104 --> 09:32.137
cried at night.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.105
Well, that's what babies do.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.007
Oh, tell me about it.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.076
I've had five of my own.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.781
I'm sure they were
very devoted.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.783
Anybody live over there?

09:44.785 --> 09:45.784
It's empty.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.052
What about there?

09:47.054 --> 09:48.053
No home.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.921
But somebody lives there.

09:49.923 --> 09:50.922
<i> Aqui esta.</i>

09:50.924 --> 09:52.190
Mr. Turner.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.858
Is there a problem?

09:53.860 --> 09:55.126
Should there be?

09:55.128 --> 09:58.129
You don't look
like you're from Con Ed.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.067
Mr. Turner--
Sergeant Cerreta.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.201
Detective Logan.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.071
We're looking
for a neighbor of yours,

10:06.073 --> 10:07.806
a woman by the name of Ward.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.942
I'm not your neighborly
kind of guy.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.777
Mind if we come in

10:12.779 --> 10:14.079
and have
a little chat?

10:14.081 --> 10:16.715
You look like nice people,
but it's a mess.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.316
I'd only invite my friends in.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.918
The woman downstairs

10:19.920 --> 10:22.287
with the baby--
have you seen her?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.289
A lot of people
took the buyout.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.092
Landlord's offering
five grand to leave.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.293
It's a real good deal.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.161
It's obviously
not that good.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.097
I'm on disability-- bad back.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.799
I pay $248.65 A month--

10:34.801 --> 10:36.101
rent control.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.769
Bad back, huh?

10:37.771 --> 10:40.138
Must give you trouble
in the gym, right?

10:40.140 --> 10:41.973
I like to work on myself.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.209
Develop-- what do you call them?

10:44.211 --> 10:45.844
Compensatory muscles.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.013
The $248-- where do you send it?

10:48.015 --> 10:49.180
Corman Equities

10:49.182 --> 10:50.749
over on First Avenue.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.184
I'd let you in
to get the exact address...

10:53.186 --> 10:54.285
Oh, yeah, we know.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.221
You only invite
your friends

10:56.223 --> 10:58.223
into the inner sanctum.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.160
WOMAN:
<i> Remember the old song</i>

11:02.162 --> 11:04.929
"Where have all
the investment bankers gone?"

11:04.931 --> 11:07.198
Two bedrooms renting
for the price of one.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.101
Ward, Ward, Ward.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.136
There's none here.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.203
Which building?

11:12.205 --> 11:16.207
736 East Third Street,
apartment 2-B.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.209
Oh.<i> That</i> building.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.311
I was offering buyouts.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.180
I figured I'd renovate

11:22.182 --> 11:24.816
and get those hip
upper westsiders

11:24.818 --> 11:28.186
who want to live downtown,
but the way the economy is...

11:28.188 --> 11:30.922
You're looking for
tenants with style?

11:30.924 --> 11:33.158
That, a lot of cash.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.226
Adele Loftus, 2-B.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.395
This lease goes back
to the '50s.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.331
We're looking for
a young woman named Ward.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.966
What can I tell you?

11:41.968 --> 11:43.201
What<i> can</i> you tell me?

11:43.203 --> 11:47.138
Loftus has a bargain--
$230 a month.

11:47.140 --> 11:50.942
Yeah, that building--
bargain.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.310
Thanks for your time,

11:52.312 --> 11:53.411
Miss Corman.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.882
The medical examiner guarantees
the kid was dead

11:57.884 --> 12:00.952
at least two hours before
he was put on the floor.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.187
So what do we got?

12:02.189 --> 12:04.189
A lease from the '50s,
different last names...

12:04.191 --> 12:06.191
Are we going to turn up
Miss Ward?

12:06.193 --> 12:08.827
That building
is half empty.
It's a dump.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.895
Why does it need
a full-time super?

12:10.897 --> 12:12.263
I don't know, Phil.
Copper plumbing.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.833
A couple junkies could strip
a brownstone

12:14.835 --> 12:16.434
faster than they
could shoot up.

12:16.436 --> 12:19.070
No Adele Loftus
in the five boroughs.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.872
Why do I doubt
anyone there

12:20.874 --> 12:22.307
used an assumed name?

12:22.309 --> 12:23.875
I checked
social security.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.310
She died a year ago.

12:25.312 --> 12:29.214
The death certificate says
she's buried at St. Stephen's.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.349
Well, if only the dead
could talk.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.951
They don't need to,

12:32.953 --> 12:35.253
unless, God forbid,
someone moved the body.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.423
Somebody's paying
to maintain the grave.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.397
I've always liked graveyards.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.366
Don't tell me--
a quiet, peaceful place

12:48.368 --> 12:51.936
where you can contemplate
your own insignificance?

12:51.938 --> 12:54.372
No. Every spring my mother
used to take us out

12:54.374 --> 12:57.075
to Grandma and Grandpa's grave--
it's an Old-World thing.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.377
She would plant flowers
and wash the stone.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.346
Then she'd spread
a tablecloth

13:01.348 --> 13:03.882
and we would have
a beautiful picnic

13:03.884 --> 13:05.350
with Grandma
and Grandpa.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.819
You'd picnic
on their graves?

13:07.820 --> 13:10.287
Well, were we going to picnic
on strangers' graves?

13:10.290 --> 13:12.023
Maintenance
for Adele Loftus

13:12.025 --> 13:13.992
is paid for
by Charlayne Ward--

13:13.994 --> 13:15.126
Long Island City.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.395
And if you'd like
to pay your respects,

13:17.397 --> 13:20.165
Miss Loftus is buried
in quadrant G-7.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.433
I've marked it
right on the map here.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.470
Thanks a lot.
Okay.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.242
CERRETA:
<i> Who is Adele Loftus?</i>

13:31.244 --> 13:33.311
Adele Loftus was our grand-mama.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.114
My sister Jackie
took care of her.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.448
Your sister have any kids?

13:37.450 --> 13:39.951
A little boy, Henry.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.519
Charlayne,
here we are

13:41.521 --> 13:43.087
two police officers

13:43.089 --> 13:45.223
asking about your sister
and her son

13:45.225 --> 13:47.392
and you don't seem
too worried.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.093
You don't even
ask why.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.329
When was the last time
you talked to Jackie?

13:51.331 --> 13:53.298
Jackie don't have no phone.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.532
Couldn't pay the bill.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.035
Look, man,
we ain't talked to her.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.503
We haven't even seen her.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.039
Mike, did we ask
if he'd seen her?

14:01.041 --> 14:02.440
And she doesn't call?

14:02.442 --> 14:04.042
If I was in trouble

14:04.044 --> 14:05.543
I'd talk to my only sister.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.379
Look, man,
Jackie did not call, okay?

14:08.381 --> 14:10.014
Here's what we can do.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.983
I can leave
Detective Logan here.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.218
I'll go get a warrant

14:13.220 --> 14:15.987
and when I come back,
we'll search the place.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.288
We can pass the time--

14:17.290 --> 14:19.157
two, three hours,
watch some TV.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.125
Does that sound
like fun to you?

14:21.127 --> 14:23.494
Or you can just let us look now.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.464
You're about as far into my home
as you're gonna be.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.467
So why don't you just go on
and get your warrant.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.202
(<i> door opens</i> )

14:31.204 --> 14:32.470
Jackie!

14:32.472 --> 14:33.605
Sorry, Charlayne.

14:33.607 --> 14:36.207
I did the wrong thing, so...

14:36.209 --> 14:38.409
where else am I going to go?

14:49.422 --> 14:51.389
CERRETA:
She left him alone
in that apartment.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.657
I didn't...

14:52.659 --> 14:54.058
You just watched him

14:54.060 --> 14:55.026
freeze to death.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.027
Detective...

14:56.029 --> 14:57.462
I had to go to work.

14:57.464 --> 15:00.565
Mrs. Hillyard-- I was serving
at one of her parties

15:00.567 --> 15:04.135
and Serena Price, a neighbor,
comes right after school.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.004
Henry's never alone for long.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.505
Long enough
to freeze to death.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.507
CERRETA:
Where's the father?

15:09.509 --> 15:12.010
Truck driver--
killed in an accident.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.145
I thought Serena would be there.

15:14.147 --> 15:19.584
I get home, I don't know,
around midnight,

15:19.586 --> 15:22.020
and the apartment is dark,

15:22.022 --> 15:24.455
freezing cold, and...

15:24.457 --> 15:26.457
Henry, he wasn't moving.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.492
I took him

15:27.494 --> 15:28.626
to the hospital.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.961
And left him.

15:29.963 --> 15:33.398
I was out of my head.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.633
I didn't mean
to leave him there.

15:35.635 --> 15:39.504
He was...

15:39.506 --> 15:45.677
he was... he was so cold.

15:45.679 --> 15:49.681
I kept hoping, you know...

15:49.683 --> 15:52.417
I didn't know what to do.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.518
Gentlemen,

15:53.520 --> 15:55.053
can we...?

16:04.097 --> 16:06.497
She's responsible
for that baby's death.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.632
Open and shut.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.068
The only thing
open and shut here

16:10.070 --> 16:11.202
is your mind.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.154
The D.A. might go

16:13.155 --> 16:15.105
for endangering
the welfare of a child.

16:15.108 --> 16:18.109
The law says she
has to exercise
reasonable diligence.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.277
ATTORNEY:
The law says

16:19.279 --> 16:21.212
she had to knowingly
or intentionally

16:21.214 --> 16:22.747
or recklessly
or negligently

16:22.749 --> 16:24.115
cause harm.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.651
I don't think
any of those apply.

16:26.653 --> 16:30.154
We can hand the D.A.
a solid case for negligence.

16:30.156 --> 16:33.157
Has she talked
to the baby-sitter
since the boy died?

16:33.159 --> 16:34.625
She panicked.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.194
We'll check her story.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.464
With your busy schedule,
maybe you could squeeze it in

16:39.466 --> 16:41.632
<i> before</i> you indict her.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.268
I'll talk to the D.A.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.537
Meantime, she stays
at Central Booking.

16:46.539 --> 16:49.140
Look, it beats Rikers.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.142
She's a good mother.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.643
She loves Henry.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.713
Were you supposed to be there,
Serena?

16:55.715 --> 16:57.015
I got stuck--

16:57.017 --> 16:58.583
the subway coming uptown.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.486
It's not her fault.
She feels bad enough as it is.

17:01.488 --> 17:04.155
SERENA:
Jackie said
she might have to leave.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.190
I have a key
to the apartment.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.191
The super says

17:07.193 --> 17:09.127
there's no way

17:09.128 --> 17:11.062
he opens the front door
for a stranger.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.731
Like that place
is something to protect.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.633
You'd been there before?

17:15.635 --> 17:17.201
He opened the door for me once,

17:17.203 --> 17:19.737
but now he says he doesn't
know me from Adam.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.739
I told him
about Henry,

17:21.741 --> 17:25.309
but he said Jackie and Henry
were gone.

17:25.311 --> 17:29.080
I thought Jackie
must have been mad.

17:29.082 --> 17:32.116
She'd never want me
to come back.

17:32.118 --> 17:34.685
A black girl--
<i> negra senorita?</i>

17:34.687 --> 17:37.688
She tried to get
into the building.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.290
<i> Yo no se.</i>

17:39.292 --> 17:41.259
Here we go again.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.094
Jackie Ward's
baby-sitter.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.629
She's a young
black girl

17:44.631 --> 17:45.763
about 16 years old.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.665
Her name is Serena Price.

17:49.235 --> 17:52.570
Excuse me.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.209
Oh... Mike.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.111
Look at this.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.679
He bought out

18:01.681 --> 18:04.348
the whole hardware store.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.284
Pretty cold, huh?

18:06.286 --> 18:07.552
<i> Hace frio?</i>

18:07.554 --> 18:08.619
No heat.

18:08.621 --> 18:09.720
Since when?

18:09.722 --> 18:10.721
The morning.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.191
I fix it tonight.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.093
Yeah.

18:15.095 --> 18:18.196
Six space heaters
and the furnace just went out.

18:18.198 --> 18:22.633
If Jackie's telling the truth,
it was off two days ago.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.369
First time we were here,
was the heat on?

18:25.371 --> 18:27.305
The old lady
on the third floor

18:27.307 --> 18:28.840
had her coat on inside.

18:28.842 --> 18:31.375
The building's half empty
and a wreck.

18:31.377 --> 18:32.376
You get a message?

18:32.378 --> 18:34.378
The landlord
would be thrilled

18:34.380 --> 18:36.214
if the tenants left.

18:36.216 --> 18:39.784
Maybe the heat was off
accidentally on purpose.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.590
736 East Third,
owned by Iris Corman.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.391
Corman Equities.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.393
You got a contract on it?

18:51.131 --> 18:52.864
Thank you.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.298
Any changes
in the amount

18:54.300 --> 18:56.134
over the last
six months?

18:58.304 --> 19:01.239
I'll be getting back
to you, okay?

19:01.241 --> 19:04.675
Petrillo Oil contracted
to service the furnace.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.410
No reports of trouble.

19:06.412 --> 19:10.281
But in the last six months,
no change in oil consumption.

19:10.283 --> 19:13.417
Colder in February
than September.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.419
Shut it down, burn less.

19:15.421 --> 19:16.787
We prove harassment

19:16.789 --> 19:19.390
Jackie's behavior
is going to look better.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.859
You want to make this stick?

19:21.861 --> 19:23.227
Find somebody

19:23.229 --> 19:24.729
who was driven out.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.197
Department of Housing
and Community Renewal.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.899
They keep leases on computer
for four years.

19:27.901 --> 19:30.168
And talk to Jackie Ward again.

19:30.170 --> 19:33.905
If she knew the heat was off,
she is still on the ropes.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.309
LOGAN:
<i> Tell us about the building.</i>

19:38.311 --> 19:40.711
There was never
that much heat, ever.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.181
Sometimes it was off
an hour or two.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.349
They said it was
an old furnace.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.484
Did you complain?

19:46.486 --> 19:47.785
It wasn't my lease.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.320
It was my grandma's.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.389
I complain,
they find out she's dead

19:51.391 --> 19:53.724
they get me out in a minute.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.326
LOGAN:
The law changed.

19:55.328 --> 19:58.896
You lived there when she did,
you're entitled to a lease.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.231
I didn't know that.

20:00.233 --> 20:03.801
I was scared we'd end up
in a shelter.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.771
The tenants that left--
did they complain?

20:06.773 --> 20:08.339
What am I hearing?

20:08.341 --> 20:09.440
I kept to myself.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.808
All I know is

20:10.810 --> 20:13.978
the Spanish guy takes over--
the new super--

20:13.980 --> 20:15.346
and it gets worse.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.948
He wouldn't do nothing.

20:16.950 --> 20:19.283
ATTORNEY:
The heat was off

20:19.285 --> 20:20.451
intentionally?

20:20.453 --> 20:21.819
We're trying to establish

20:21.821 --> 20:27.225
whether it was done
to harass the tenants.

20:27.227 --> 20:28.226
Wait, wait, wait.

20:28.228 --> 20:31.346
Wait.

20:31.347 --> 20:34.465
You mean to tell me
that they did this on purpose?

20:42.442 --> 20:43.441
Iris Corman?

20:43.443 --> 20:44.875
What a gem.

20:44.877 --> 20:48.479
We got a whole desk
devoted to complaints on her.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.815
Hampton-- cops are asking
about Iris Corman.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.316
Sweet Iris--

20:52.318 --> 20:54.719
Scum Landlord of the Year
three years running.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.421
Lock her up
and throw away the key.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.823
Or in one of her buildings.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.825
No water,
broken windows, floods.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.860
A textbook on how
to empty a place.

21:02.862 --> 21:05.463
Is she trying to empty
the place on East Third Street?

21:05.465 --> 21:08.399
Look, I'm a city employee.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.301
For me to accuse her...

21:10.303 --> 21:13.804
Why don't you take the records,
make your own conclusions.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.275
Moved out. September.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.443
Really bad problems.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.746
Water's coming down
the bathroom walls.

21:21.748 --> 21:24.282
The super turns
the water off.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.751
Two days later,
the flood's gone.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.586
No hot water.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.788
You think it was intentional?

21:30.790 --> 21:32.990
Come on, I went down.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.860
I tried
to turn the water on.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.528
The basement
was locked up.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.463
Many buildings
keep it locked.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.865
Never before.

21:40.867 --> 21:43.534
I took the buyout.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.870
I had as much
as I could take.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.538
My lock was broken.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.907
The super pretended
he didn't understand.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.876
He's got trouble
with English.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.344
The trouble is
he's alive.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.979
I put a chair
against the door.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.048
Middle of the night-- boom--
the door's down,

21:57.050 --> 21:59.617
and that creep Turner's
in my living room.

21:59.619 --> 22:02.420
Is he angry with the whole
world, or is it just you?

22:02.422 --> 22:04.922
That guy is a tenant
like I'm the Queen of England.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.458
I never saw him at night--
he's sleeping somewhere else?

22:07.460 --> 22:09.527
I try to get
the heat back on,

22:09.529 --> 22:11.495
I got to get past Turner.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.397
He's a thug, pure and simple.

22:13.399 --> 22:14.532
<i> This is Turner's</i>

22:14.534 --> 22:16.217
sixth building for Iris Corman.

22:16.218 --> 22:17.901
He clears out tenants--
that's what he does.

22:17.904 --> 22:21.005
He's got three priors--
assault and menacing--

22:21.007 --> 22:23.374
tenants trying
to get heat.

22:23.376 --> 22:25.910
Depraved indifference
homicide-- murder two.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.545
There's another building.

22:27.547 --> 22:28.946
Old lady gets pneumonia.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.514
Lack of heat. She dies.

22:30.516 --> 22:31.849
No charges filed

22:31.851 --> 22:33.851
because they can't
tie them together.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.387
Charging Jackie Ward
may be pointless

22:36.389 --> 22:37.521
but murder two?

22:37.523 --> 22:39.857
We have to prove intent.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.343
Turner's been doing this
for years.

22:42.344 --> 22:44.828
Which doesn't prove the heat
was cut off deliberately
the day the baby died.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.064
Tirado didn't have six
space heaters for no reason.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.933
They were all
brand-new.

22:48.935 --> 22:51.001
It's a reach, but...
maybe Tirado, okay?

22:51.003 --> 22:53.904
Turner-- we have no link
to the Ward baby.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.673
Maybe we do--
the baby-sitter.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.541
Serena Price.
You remember she said

22:57.543 --> 22:59.877
the super wouldn't
let her in, didn't
recognize her.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.412
You think Serena
speaks Spanish?

23:01.414 --> 23:03.481
No, of course she doesn't.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.483
It wasn't the super
who kept her out.

23:05.485 --> 23:07.118
it was Turner,
she talked to Turner.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.086
Thank you. It's been
bothering me. Hah?

23:16.496 --> 23:18.662
Jose Tirado,
step outside, please.

23:18.664 --> 23:19.964
You're under arrest

23:19.966 --> 23:22.166
for the murder
of Henry Ward.

23:22.168 --> 23:24.168
Put your hands
behind your back.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.637
Come on,
you've done this before.

23:26.639 --> 23:27.605
Where's Turner?

23:27.607 --> 23:29.106
Turner no home.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.174
(<i> pounding</i> )

23:30.176 --> 23:31.876
WOMAN:
Stop! Stop!

23:31.878 --> 23:33.177
Stop!

23:33.179 --> 23:35.045
TURNER:
The lock is broken.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.981
It has to be replaced.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.482
You're not the super.

23:38.484 --> 23:40.718
Turner!

23:42.989 --> 23:45.656
Just give me an excuse.

23:49.595 --> 23:50.895
No way.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.029
(<i> drops hammer</i> )

23:55.168 --> 23:57.435
You just got nailed.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.571
Joseph Turner,
you're under arrest

24:00.573 --> 24:02.039
for the murder
of Henry Ward.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.575
You have the right
to remain silent.

24:04.576 --> 24:07.110
Anything you say will
be used against you
in a court of law.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.712
Do you understand that?
Yes.

24:08.714 --> 24:10.948
You have the right
to an attorney...

24:15.955 --> 24:19.957
You have to wonder
how these people sleep at night.

24:19.959 --> 24:23.461
The connection
between morality and sleep.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.896
I guessed I missed that
in law school.

24:25.898 --> 24:29.200
Tossing little old ladies
into the street.

24:29.202 --> 24:30.968
Going for manslaughter

24:30.970 --> 24:34.605
is very admirable,
but how do you prove intent?

24:34.607 --> 24:38.509
I aim a gun at you.
Is that intent to harm?

24:38.511 --> 24:40.010
It is if the gun goes off.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.679
cut off the heat?
Why did they

24:41.681 --> 24:43.714
To cause harm
so people would leave.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.216
That's intent,
and that's manslaughter.

24:45.218 --> 24:46.984
How do you sell it to a jury?

24:46.986 --> 24:48.819
Turner's crimes
have a common scheme.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.654
I get his prior convictions
admitted,

24:50.656 --> 24:52.890
the intent to harm is clear.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.860
His record gets admitted
as pattern crime.

24:55.862 --> 25:00.231
On a bad day with a tired judge,
we can sell tickets to that.

25:00.233 --> 25:02.500
ROBINETTE:
Or maybe we get lucky.

25:02.502 --> 25:03.667
Roll the super on Turner.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.803
Get Turner's record admitted.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.671
He rolls on the landlord.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.507
Turner's worked a long time

25:09.509 --> 25:11.259
for Iris Corman.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.010
They hang together
or they don't hang at all.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.578
Thanks for your optimism.

25:14.580 --> 25:17.882
I didn't say don't try.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.817
Where are we, Cuba?
This is justice?

25:19.819 --> 25:23.654
Reckless endangerment one
if your client testifies
against Mr. Turner.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.589
The idea
of responsibility...

25:25.591 --> 25:27.791
You think the charge
is inflated?

25:27.793 --> 25:29.527
We're testing it with a jury.

25:29.529 --> 25:30.628
With no evidence.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.563
One, Mr. Tirado
had separate heat.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.031
Two, he told the police
he ordered

25:34.033 --> 25:36.067
a furnace part-- no order.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.102
Three, the contractor said
there was nothing wrong

25:38.104 --> 25:39.770
with the furnace.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.572
Okay. Just a damn minute.

25:41.574 --> 25:43.707
<i> Esta gente</i>
<i> quiere encerrarte.</i>

25:43.709 --> 25:47.745
<i> Si yo testigo</i>
<i> puedo estar muerto.</i>

25:47.747 --> 25:49.079
Oh, no, no, tell him

25:49.081 --> 25:50.814
no one will kill him.

25:50.816 --> 25:53.584
Everybody knows
what<i> muerto</i> means.

25:53.586 --> 25:55.986
Reckless endangerment two.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.855
He does no time.

26:03.763 --> 26:06.630
Who turned off the heat?

26:06.632 --> 26:09.867
The feed pipe,
Turner, he pull it.

26:09.869 --> 26:15.005
He say we get these people out,
we get paid more money.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.007
(<i> speaking Spanish</i> )

26:17.009 --> 26:19.910
He wanted to fix the furnace.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.845
Turner stopped him.

26:21.847 --> 26:24.648
MAN:
<i> Obviously, Mr. Tirado is lying.</i>

26:24.650 --> 26:26.116
That illiterate moron.

26:26.118 --> 26:28.018
The idea that I'm...
Please, please.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.853
And Tirado is so credible?

26:29.855 --> 26:31.922
He's the super.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.824
You make this crime a habit.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.759
Two prior assaults, menacing.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.862
A jury sees his
history and...

26:38.864 --> 26:40.030
Call Bellevue,
make a reservation.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.632
You're out of your mind.

26:41.634 --> 26:44.802
You couldn't bribe a judge
to get that allowed.

26:44.804 --> 26:45.936
Convicted this time

26:45.938 --> 26:48.005
you don't do
one or two years,

26:48.007 --> 26:49.873
it goes up to 25.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.710
Oh, heavy.
You can see I'm terrified.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.945
Marc, tell him
the facts of life.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.848
What, the birds, the bees,
the penal law?

26:57.850 --> 26:59.917
He knows them
better than we do.

26:59.919 --> 27:01.919
convictions.
He has two felony

27:01.921 --> 27:04.989
One more, he goes up
as a persistent offender.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.757
My first conviction

27:06.759 --> 27:07.758
was appealed.

27:07.760 --> 27:08.792
I didn't serve a day

27:08.794 --> 27:10.761
until after my second
conviction.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.863
That counts as one offense,
not two.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.965
You convict me,
I get six to 12.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.767
I'm out in two years.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.369
We're submitting
a motion

27:18.371 --> 27:21.805
to have your prior convictions
admitted as evidence.

27:21.807 --> 27:24.942
I'll bet it's
beautifully written, Ben.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.677
And it's worthless.

27:26.679 --> 27:28.912
I'll see you in chambers.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.785
<i> Now, you can't allow this.</i>

27:34.787 --> 27:36.420
The jury hears
he attacked three tenants,

27:36.422 --> 27:38.922
they'll beg you to execute him
in the courtroom.

27:38.924 --> 27:42.426
Relax. We don't have
the death penalty anymore.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.228
virtually identical,
Three cases,

27:44.230 --> 27:46.230
in which Mr. Turner
assaulted tenants

27:46.232 --> 27:48.232
who were trying
to restore the heat.

27:48.234 --> 27:49.700
That's my point.

27:49.702 --> 27:51.101
They're assault cases.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.670
They're not about heat.

27:52.672 --> 27:55.339
this straight.
Let me get

27:55.340 --> 27:58.007
Making the buildings unlivable
is intent to cause injury.

27:58.010 --> 28:01.779
That's the
common scheme.
Yeah, but you're not gonna...

28:04.083 --> 28:06.417
It's a novel theory...

28:06.419 --> 28:07.818
and I like it.

28:07.820 --> 28:10.120
This court rules
that Mr. Turner's

28:10.122 --> 28:13.791
previous crimes
may be introduced into evidence.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.443
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.094
ROBINETTE:
<i> We thought Turner was a thug.</i>

28:17.096 --> 28:19.730
He's no saint.

28:19.732 --> 28:21.832
The buildings Iris Corman owns,
Turner owns them with her.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.834
Won't put her away so quick.

28:23.836 --> 28:26.136
He wants to protect
his investments.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.072
That's not the only reason.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.207
They own a house together.
600 grand.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.275
Sands Point.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.210
They live in it together?

28:34.246 --> 28:36.280
Love makes the world go 'round.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.482
Also makes
plea bargains difficult.

28:38.484 --> 28:41.251
We convict,
maybe he turns on Corman

28:41.253 --> 28:42.920
for a sentencing recommendation.

28:42.922 --> 28:44.288
And then she confesses.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.223
I wouldn't count on it.

28:47.293 --> 28:51.161
WOMAN:
<i> Mr. Turner showed up in august.</i>

28:51.163 --> 28:53.230
I moved out a little
after Christmas.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.765
The incident

28:54.767 --> 28:56.767
where Mr. Turner assaulted you--

28:56.769 --> 28:57.901
how did it begin?

28:57.903 --> 28:59.303
I went
to the boiler room.

28:59.305 --> 29:01.939
Turner's there,
screwing in a lock.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.507
I try to get
into the room.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.976
He smacks me across the face.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.178
Did you sustain
any injuries?

29:08.180 --> 29:10.047
He split my lip.
I had six stitches.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.248
The vicious jerk.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.750
Objection.

29:12.752 --> 29:13.751
Sustained.

29:13.753 --> 29:14.852
The jury

29:14.854 --> 29:16.787
will disregard
that remark.

29:16.789 --> 29:18.288
SERENA:
I was standing

29:18.290 --> 29:21.759
at the front door
of the building, pounding.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.093
He wouldn't let me in.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.995
Do you see him in the
courtroom today?

29:24.997 --> 29:26.196
He's sitting
right there.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.998
Would the record show

29:28.000 --> 29:31.168
that she is indicating
the defendant, Joseph Turner.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.003
Let the record so indicate.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.539
Had you seen
the man before?

29:35.541 --> 29:39.042
Every time I went
to take care of Henry.

29:39.044 --> 29:42.813
I told him Henry was inside,
but this man--

29:42.815 --> 29:44.948
he said
he didn't know me.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.184
He said Jackie
took Henry with her.

29:47.186 --> 29:48.986
Thank you.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.921
Your witness.

29:53.559 --> 29:54.925
Miss Price,

29:54.927 --> 29:56.994
how did you describe Mr. Turner

29:56.996 --> 29:58.896
to the police?

29:58.898 --> 30:00.297
Well, I...

30:00.299 --> 30:02.199
I... I didn't.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.300
Is that so?

30:03.302 --> 30:04.568
Didn't you tell them

30:04.570 --> 30:07.838
he was the building
superintendent?

30:07.840 --> 30:08.972
Yes.

30:08.974 --> 30:10.808
But he's not.

30:10.810 --> 30:12.976
If you'd been there
that often

30:12.978 --> 30:15.212
how come you didn't know that?

30:17.249 --> 30:19.950
How was I supposed to know?

30:19.952 --> 30:21.552
He's there a lot,

30:21.554 --> 30:23.353
so I thought...

30:23.355 --> 30:25.222
You didn't know
who he was?

30:25.224 --> 30:27.991
Now, is it possible that he
didn't know who you were?

30:27.993 --> 30:29.927
Objection.

30:29.928 --> 30:31.862
He's asking the witness what was
in another person's mind.

30:31.864 --> 30:32.863
Sustained.

30:32.865 --> 30:34.865
TIRADO:
<i> Yo le dije a Joe</i>

30:34.867 --> 30:36.934
<i> que teniamos que poner</i>
<i> el</i> steam.

30:36.936 --> 30:40.037
<i> Y trate de abrir la puerta</i>
<i> del cuarto del</i> boiler.

30:40.039 --> 30:41.071
I told Mr. Turner

30:41.073 --> 30:42.906
we had to turn
the heat on.

30:42.908 --> 30:45.843
I tried to open the door
to the furnace room.

30:45.845 --> 30:48.879
And what did Mr. Turner do?

30:48.881 --> 30:51.014
<i> ¬øY que hizo</i>
<i> el Se√±or Turner?</i>

30:51.016 --> 30:53.116
<i> Turner me dijo</i>
<i> que lo dejara</i>

30:53.118 --> 30:54.117
<i> apagado.</i>

30:54.119 --> 30:55.586
<i> Yo lo queria prender.</i>

30:55.588 --> 30:58.088
<i> Pero el me ordeno que me fuera</i>

30:58.090 --> 30:59.256
<i> que me largara.</i>

30:59.258 --> 31:02.125
Turner said to leave
the furnace off.

31:02.127 --> 31:05.863
I was going to turn it on,
but he pulled me away.

31:05.865 --> 31:08.932
Mr. Tirado, in the past,
did you help

31:08.934 --> 31:11.635
Mr. Turner at all
to harass other tenants?

31:11.637 --> 31:13.871
<i> ¬øTu ayudaste</i>
<i> al Se√±or Turner</i>

31:13.873 --> 31:16.373
<i> a hacerle da√±o</i>
<i> a los inquilinos?</i>

31:16.375 --> 31:20.611
<i> Si. Ayude.</i>

31:20.613 --> 31:23.114
Yes, I did.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.616
WARD:
I thought it would only take
a few minutes

31:25.618 --> 31:27.618
and he'd be fine.

31:27.620 --> 31:31.088
How long was Henry alone?

31:31.090 --> 31:32.890
Seven hours.

31:32.892 --> 31:35.325
When you left,
what was the temperature

31:35.327 --> 31:37.361
in the apartment?

31:37.363 --> 31:41.665
Um... I had a sweater on,
but it was okay.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.467
It wasn't too cold.

31:43.469 --> 31:45.369
And when you returned?

31:47.640 --> 31:52.209
I could see my breath
in the air.

31:52.211 --> 31:55.012
Thank you.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.947
No further questions.

31:58.684 --> 32:02.019
Now, Mrs. Ward,
I know this is very difficult

32:02.021 --> 32:04.087
so I only have a few questions.

32:04.089 --> 32:07.357
You testified that you
didn't call the apartment

32:07.359 --> 32:09.159
because you had no phone.

32:09.161 --> 32:11.662
Did you think
of calling a neighbor?

32:11.664 --> 32:16.099
Um... I didn't know them
too well.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.335
No one in the neighborhood?

32:18.337 --> 32:21.438
No. I pretty much
kept to myself.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.508
Did you think of calling
Serena price's mother,

32:24.510 --> 32:27.044
to make sure that Serena

32:27.046 --> 32:30.080
was in fact
taking care of Henry?

32:30.082 --> 32:33.350
I didn't think of that. No.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.153
Then who's really responsible
for Henry's death?

32:36.155 --> 32:37.321
Objection.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.022
Withdrawn.

32:39.024 --> 32:41.058
No further questions.

32:46.999 --> 32:49.032
Will the defendant please rise?

32:49.034 --> 32:51.001
<i> The people v. Joseph Turner,</i>

32:51.003 --> 32:53.503
on the sole count
of the indictment

32:53.505 --> 32:58.041
the charge of manslaughter
in the second degree

32:58.043 --> 33:00.711
how does the jury find?

33:00.713 --> 33:03.213
We find the defendant guilty.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.317
I thank the jury.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.052
Short date
for sentencing.

33:09.054 --> 33:11.171
Your Honor,

33:11.172 --> 33:13.289
the people request
a pre-sentencing conference

33:13.292 --> 33:17.094
at which Mrs. Ward be permitted
to address the court.

33:17.096 --> 33:21.331
The court will consider
the people's request.
Court is adjourned.

33:21.333 --> 33:24.735
There's a reason I want
you there. I want you
personally to ask for the max.

33:24.737 --> 33:26.436
It won't affect the sentence.

33:26.438 --> 33:29.740
Whatever Turner and Corman
are paying Menakerarc menaker,

33:29.742 --> 33:31.742
he's earning every dime.

33:31.744 --> 33:33.310
What's that?
A juror, number seven--

33:33.312 --> 33:36.313
he's white,
but he speaks fluent Spanish.

33:36.315 --> 33:39.549
There's some question
about Tirado's testimony--

33:39.551 --> 33:41.151
a mistranslation.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.420
I don't know how serious it is.

33:43.422 --> 33:46.790
Menaker probably
called every juror.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.392
Desperate but clever.

33:48.394 --> 33:50.260
Asking for a mistrial?

33:50.262 --> 33:53.530
I talked to Judge Barry's clerk.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.033
He'll probably get it.

33:56.035 --> 33:58.335
Son of a bitch.

34:03.609 --> 34:06.176
"Turner said
leave the furnace off.

34:06.178 --> 34:09.579
I was going to turn it on,
but he pulled me away."

34:09.581 --> 34:12.049
That's not
an accurate translation.

34:12.051 --> 34:14.518
How far off is it?

34:14.520 --> 34:16.520
What would be accurate?

34:16.522 --> 34:19.656
I... I misheard.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.425
I got the verb wrong.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.827
It shouldn't
have been "pulled away."

34:23.829 --> 34:25.629
He said "ordered away."

34:25.631 --> 34:27.564
MENAKER:
It's the heart

34:27.566 --> 34:30.100
of the pattern crime
issue, Judge.

34:30.102 --> 34:32.702
In previous cases,
Mr. Turner was violent

34:32.704 --> 34:33.804
but not this time.

34:33.806 --> 34:36.473
If a juror translated it
for them

34:36.475 --> 34:38.842
we will never know
what they thought.

34:38.844 --> 34:42.412
At the worst, it's a minor
linguistic difference.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.998
Maybe.

34:44.999 --> 34:47.583
Mr. Norman, you discussed this
with the other jurors?

34:47.586 --> 34:49.619
I told them what I heard.

34:49.621 --> 34:53.457
He said "ordered," not "pulled."

34:54.626 --> 34:59.596
Mr. Norman, do you know
why we sequester juries?

34:59.598 --> 35:03.533
Before the trial began,
I said the jury

35:03.535 --> 35:07.237
mustn't consider evidence
not heard in the courtroom.

35:07.239 --> 35:10.674
Now, you told the jurors
something only you heard.

35:10.676 --> 35:14.644
But I only told them
what he really said.

35:14.646 --> 35:17.147
That's true. You did.

35:17.149 --> 35:19.783
No blame here.

35:19.785 --> 35:23.587
It's a mess,
gentlemen.

35:26.525 --> 35:27.724
It's a mistrial,

35:27.726 --> 35:30.527
and the people
will have to retry

35:30.529 --> 35:32.529
Mr. Turner.

35:32.531 --> 35:35.632
We got a conviction once,
we'll get it again.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.584
Every jury is different.

35:37.585 --> 35:39.535
They're not stupid. I'll put
your client away, and he'll

35:39.538 --> 35:42.139
serve the max, if I have to show
for every parole hearing myself.

35:42.141 --> 35:43.540
If it gets that far.

35:43.542 --> 35:46.610
We're not taking a deal
unless you give us Corman--

35:46.612 --> 35:48.778
same crime, evidence,
and conviction.

35:48.780 --> 35:51.248
I'm moving to have
Turner's records

35:51.250 --> 35:53.783
excluded from the
second trial.
Won't happen.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.686
If I were you, I would look at
what the appellate division

35:56.688 --> 35:57.721
has been doing lately.

35:57.723 --> 36:00.157
Suppose you win
the second trial.

36:00.159 --> 36:02.626
You'll never survive
an appeal.

36:02.628 --> 36:05.495
Mr. Turner will take
reckless endangerment two.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.197
Misdemeanor-- in his dreams.

36:07.199 --> 36:09.733
What looks better
on the news at 6:00--

36:09.735 --> 36:11.902
his dreams
or yours, hmm?

36:14.740 --> 36:16.573
STONE:
<i> It's a bluff.</i>

36:16.575 --> 36:18.141
It's a hustle.

36:18.142 --> 36:19.708
And it's a possibility.
Menaker's no fool.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.845
If the jury doesn't hear
of Turner's record

36:21.847 --> 36:23.680
we don't get a conviction.

36:23.682 --> 36:26.716
They will hear it,
and it will stand on appeal.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.718
I'd like to play poker
with you.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.188
Leave the table
with your clothes.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.657
Six of your jurors
told reporters

36:33.659 --> 36:36.593
that they convicted
because of Turner's record

36:36.595 --> 36:39.829
not because they believed intent
to harm the baby.

36:39.831 --> 36:41.731
Court of appeals
gonna like that?

36:41.733 --> 36:43.500
Maybe we give Turner
reckless endangerment one

36:43.502 --> 36:44.601
if Corman will plead, too.

36:44.603 --> 36:46.203
Great. A child is dead

36:46.205 --> 36:48.505
and you're offering
a "d" felony?

36:48.507 --> 36:49.873
SCHIFF:
Offer it to Turner

36:49.875 --> 36:51.741
on two conditions:

36:51.743 --> 36:55.845
Corman pleads,
they both sign a consent decree

36:55.847 --> 36:59.216
not to harass tenants
in the future.

36:59.218 --> 37:02.285
Still a walk. Stinks.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.622
I don't believe this!

37:05.624 --> 37:07.891
You want me to plead guilty?
She hasn't even
been judged.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.759
STONE:
If we don't
get a deal

37:09.761 --> 37:11.828
we'll take Mr. Turner to trial

37:11.830 --> 37:14.598
and work on getting
Miss Corman indicted.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.600
You have some nerve.
I can't heat a building

37:16.602 --> 37:19.636
for what tenants are paying.
If the rent laws didn't let

37:19.638 --> 37:21.238
people live there forever
that baby would still

37:21.240 --> 37:24.574
be alive, and none
of us would be here.
Iris, please.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.776
I don't believe this.this.
It'sIt's not your fault; it's
the rent laws?

37:26.778 --> 37:29.913
For destroying the value
of my property, yeah.

37:29.915 --> 37:32.249
I ought to sue that Jackie Ward.

37:32.251 --> 37:33.717
I'm sorry about her baby

37:33.719 --> 37:36.253
but she wasn't
even a legal tenant.

37:36.255 --> 37:37.554
The hell she wasn't.

37:37.556 --> 37:38.672
That's enough.

37:38.673 --> 37:39.789
You knew the law
when you bought
that building.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.391
Round one, that's
it, over.

37:41.393 --> 37:42.692
CORMAN:
You can't believe

37:42.694 --> 37:44.694
we meant to hurt that kid.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.696
Did you care either way?

37:46.698 --> 37:47.797
You got nothing

37:47.799 --> 37:49.933
and if Tirado
hadn't rolled on me...

37:49.935 --> 37:52.002
CORMAN:
Maybe Jose Tirado's memory

37:52.004 --> 37:53.737
won't be so clear this time.

37:53.739 --> 37:55.338
Iris, enough.

37:55.340 --> 37:56.990
He's on record.

37:56.991 --> 37:58.641
Maybe he'll change
his testimony.
Iris, shut up.

37:58.644 --> 37:59.709
You admit threatening him?

37:59.711 --> 38:02.279
No, she is not.
Maybe he'll say that

38:02.281 --> 38:04.748
the D.A. forced him
to make up a story!

38:04.750 --> 38:06.683
That's an "e" felony.
You know that?

38:06.685 --> 38:08.685
She didn't say a word.
I didn't mean it.

38:08.687 --> 38:09.986
None of this happened.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.324
She blamed the rent laws?

38:14.326 --> 38:16.393
STONE:
For the death
of a baby.

38:16.395 --> 38:19.429
You'll be lucky to touch her,
and she knows it.

38:19.431 --> 38:21.898
We may have just drew
an inside straight.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.401
For two years, Corman rings up
so many complaints

38:24.403 --> 38:25.969
they can't record them
fast enough.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.038
A year ago, all of a sudden,
no more complaints.

38:28.040 --> 38:30.840
Attack of bad conscience.

38:30.842 --> 38:33.643
ROBINETTE:
No, then housing
inspector changed.

38:33.645 --> 38:34.811
So?

38:34.813 --> 38:37.847
This new inspector's
pretty generous--

38:37.849 --> 38:39.783
16 complaints against Corman--

38:39.785 --> 38:42.052
all of them resolved
in her favor.

38:42.054 --> 38:44.521
What? Bribes?

38:44.522 --> 38:46.989
Let's chase the money,
and see if we can prove it.

38:47.959 --> 38:49.693
You got 15 minutes.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.628
We're both
on the same side.

38:51.630 --> 38:52.996
I live in a small world.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.731
Don't we all?

38:54.733 --> 38:57.000
Who inspects
Iris Corman's buildings?

38:57.002 --> 38:58.335
Albert Boxer.

38:58.337 --> 38:59.836
Does he take bribes?

38:59.838 --> 39:01.738
I didn't hear that question.

39:01.740 --> 39:04.374
February 1990,
you were covering
Corman's buildings.

39:04.376 --> 39:06.409
Why did you change
assignments?

39:06.411 --> 39:08.478
My wife works
at Merchant Bank.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.879
She's in at 6:00.

39:09.881 --> 39:12.849
A new schedule, I could take
the kids to school.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.418
Iris Corman ever
offer you a bribe?

39:15.420 --> 39:16.920
She hinted.

39:16.922 --> 39:19.723
I stopped it
before she had a chance.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.825
Suppose she pulls out
a couple hundred bucks.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.827
Maybe before I know
what happens,

39:23.829 --> 39:25.395
I start thinking
about new snow tires.

39:25.397 --> 39:30.033
Albert Boxer--
is he buying new snow tires?

39:30.035 --> 39:32.702
I don't know you.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.838
I was never here.

39:34.840 --> 39:38.808
ROBINETTE:
<i> Inspector Boxer</i>
<i> used to take $100 a week</i>

39:38.810 --> 39:40.477
from his checking account.

39:40.479 --> 39:43.780
11 straight months,
he didn't withdraw a dime.

39:43.782 --> 39:45.682
That doesn't prove
he took bribes.

39:45.684 --> 39:49.152
His wife paid for groceries
by check for three years.

39:49.154 --> 39:52.856
The past 11 months,
every week, she paid cash.

39:52.858 --> 39:54.924
So they live on cash.
Iris Corman's not stupid.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.494
She's not going
to give them checks.

39:57.496 --> 40:00.430
What if somebody offered
Boxer a bribe?

40:00.432 --> 40:01.498
And...?

40:01.500 --> 40:02.999
He takes it.

40:03.001 --> 40:05.135
We turn him against Corman.

40:05.137 --> 40:07.871
You got a place to do this?

40:07.873 --> 40:10.039
I'll find one.

40:10.041 --> 40:13.910
Set it up.

40:24.189 --> 40:25.889
Testing, one, two.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.092
Where the hell's Profaci?

40:30.061 --> 40:32.829
Phil, you could play
the landlord.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.964
No, we were both at D.H.C.R.

40:34.966 --> 40:36.566
Boxer might have seen us.

40:36.568 --> 40:40.170
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

40:40.172 --> 40:41.771
Yeah, stone.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.740
Uh-huh. Oh, great.

40:43.742 --> 40:46.075
Profaci's caught in traffic.

40:46.077 --> 40:48.178
Boxer's on the way.

40:48.180 --> 40:50.447
Paul, take your coat off.

40:50.449 --> 40:52.582
CERRETA:
Yeah, and your tie.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.083
Hey, I can't do it.

40:54.085 --> 40:55.752
You're all we got.

40:55.754 --> 40:57.020
All right.

40:57.022 --> 40:58.988
Great.

41:30.489 --> 41:34.224
BOXER:
You don't look like
your name's Gagliardi.

41:34.226 --> 41:36.159
ROBINETTE:
He manages my building.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.560
Home with the flu.

41:37.562 --> 41:39.128
Simpson, Louis.

41:39.130 --> 41:41.898
Mr. Simpson,
Inspector Boxer.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.166
You got heat
in your building?

41:43.168 --> 41:44.567
We've had
two complaints.

41:44.569 --> 41:45.869
Boiler's off.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.170
We're having it fixed.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.973
You been having it fixed
for two days.

41:49.975 --> 41:52.842
I should take a look,
I have to write a summons.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.544
Is that necessary, a summons?

41:54.546 --> 41:57.046
It<i> is</i> the law.

41:57.048 --> 41:59.649
It will be fixed tomorrow.

41:59.651 --> 42:02.085
It's not working today.

42:02.087 --> 42:04.053
Come back tomorrow.

42:04.055 --> 42:07.090
Maybe I don't have to.

42:07.092 --> 42:09.225
Well, what would stop you?

42:09.227 --> 42:11.094
Think of something.

42:11.096 --> 42:14.163
Wait till he asks.

42:16.167 --> 42:19.068
Give me a general idea--
a suggestion.

42:19.070 --> 42:20.270
I'm sure you're

42:20.272 --> 42:22.639
pretty familiar
with the neighborhood.

42:22.641 --> 42:25.275
Ball park.

42:28.914 --> 42:30.079
Five hundred.

42:30.081 --> 42:32.582
Five? 250.

42:32.584 --> 42:36.085
Guess I'm going to have
to write that summons.

42:36.087 --> 42:39.022
Three. 300.

42:39.024 --> 42:41.958
Cash. Now.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.295
Albert Boxer,
you're under arrest

42:45.297 --> 42:46.296
for bribe-receiving.

42:46.298 --> 42:48.064
Come on, you can't do this.

42:48.066 --> 42:50.166
You bet your ass we can.

42:50.168 --> 42:52.602
You have the right
to remain silent.

42:52.604 --> 42:55.238
Anything you do say
can and will be used...

42:55.240 --> 42:58.107
All right, give me
my coat back, man.

42:58.109 --> 42:59.275
It's entrapment.
You offered a bribe.

42:59.277 --> 43:02.912
ROBINETTE:
You can lead
a horse to water.

43:02.914 --> 43:05.014
You can't make him steal it.

43:05.016 --> 43:07.016
He<i> solicited</i> a bribe
on tape.

43:07.018 --> 43:08.117
It's a "d" felony.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.719
Two years at Clinton.

43:09.721 --> 43:12.055
You look a little
out of shape

43:12.057 --> 43:13.690
for two years'
hard time.

43:13.692 --> 43:16.125
Come on, Ben, no judge will give
him two years.

43:16.127 --> 43:18.595
I didn't kill anybody.

43:18.597 --> 43:21.598
So I look the other way
for a few days.

43:21.600 --> 43:24.367
So the temperature
was 50 degrees inside, not 70.

43:24.369 --> 43:26.269
ROBINETTE:
Twenty.

43:26.271 --> 43:27.303
Not fifty.

43:27.305 --> 43:29.339
A baby froze to death.

43:29.341 --> 43:32.375
STONE:
I'll make it
easy on you.

43:32.377 --> 43:35.712
Here's what you're
going to do.

43:35.714 --> 43:37.714
You'll plead to a misdemeanor.

43:37.716 --> 43:40.249
You won't fight the city
about your pension.

43:40.251 --> 43:44.253
You'll testify against
every landlord and super

43:44.255 --> 43:48.224
you ever took a bribe from,
or you'll go to jail.

43:53.732 --> 43:55.732
Who do you want first?

43:55.734 --> 43:57.967
Iris Corman.

44:01.973 --> 44:10.179
STONE:
when greed is glorified.

44:10.181 --> 44:13.683
Anything is acceptable.

44:13.685 --> 44:18.321
We must decide where
to draw the line.

44:18.323 --> 44:23.159
We must decide
when greed has gone far enough

44:23.161 --> 44:25.328
to be called murder.

44:27.198 --> 44:32.001
The people will prove
that the defendants

44:32.003 --> 44:36.039
Iris Corman and Joseph Turner

44:36.041 --> 44:38.808
turned off the heat
in an apartment building

44:38.810 --> 44:40.276
they own.

44:42.347 --> 44:47.350
The people will prove
that their acts demonstrated

44:47.352 --> 44:51.754
a recklessness
that led to the death

44:51.756 --> 44:53.756
of a ten-month-old baby.

44:53.758 --> 44:59.095
The people will show
that they willfully, knowingly

44:59.097 --> 45:01.264
and without a shred of concern

45:01.266 --> 45:04.333
for the consequences
of their acts

45:04.335 --> 45:07.336
placed the value
of their real estate

45:07.338 --> 45:10.707
above the value of a human life.

45:10.709 --> 45:14.377
A baby died--

45:14.379 --> 45:16.379
a boy named Henry Ward--

45:16.381 --> 45:19.382
and they didn't shoot him,
they didn't strangle him

45:19.384 --> 45:21.851
they didn't run over him
with their car.

45:21.853 --> 45:24.320
In fact,
they never even met him

45:24.322 --> 45:27.190
but they did kill him.

45:29.260 --> 45:31.327
Now, putting the defendants

45:31.329 --> 45:34.430
Iris Corman and Joseph Turner
in jail

45:34.432 --> 45:38.501
will not bring Henry Ward
back to his mother.

45:42.373 --> 45:49.479
Putting them in jail, however,
is the only remedy we have.
