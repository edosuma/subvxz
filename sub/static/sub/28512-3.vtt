the Secretary's head to Master Read?

00:20.030 --> 00:21.990
It was our Governor himself.

07:45.110 --> 07:47.150
Well, perhaps you already know.

I saw you stealing
through the Governor's door

this head from its neck.

the reason for the Governor's rage?

It is a promissory note.

from the widow to Secretary Farlow.

08:15.470 --> 08:18.150
Were these two known
to have profitable dealings?

But uncovered by Yeardley.

be so intrigued by such matters?

than a merchant, Master Read.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.750

Consider that it might be
because I allowed you to.

is truly trying to aid you.

than a looking glass?

I know that you owe no love
to my husband.

18:51.710 --> 18:53.710
When I met him,

18:54.750 --> 18:57.390
he was a young soldier
made of modest courage,

18:57.470 --> 18:59.430
and the truest aspirations.

19:00.750 --> 19:03.430
My dearest hope, Maria,
is that these visions of yours

19:03.510 --> 19:05.950
might teach his better self
to him again.

19:07.510 --> 19:09.510
Please, I implore you.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.550
Seek again the voices
that spoke to you.

19:13.710 --> 19:16.150
If I please the Governor,

19:16.230 --> 19:18.670
you will not send Pedro
to work along the river?

19:19.950 --> 19:21.950
We might try.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.430
Are you here to face me?

19:40.510 --> 19:42.990
That was my intention, yes.
Then, face me.

19:51.630 --> 19:53.870
I decided

19:53.950 --> 19:56.230
to bring my child to you
for English medicine.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.630
That is why she died.

20:00.630 --> 20:02.630
I'll bear the blame.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.750
And that is why I will not harm you.

20:11.390 --> 20:13.510
Yet you were quick

20:13.590 --> 20:16.430
to inform Yeardley of tales

20:16.510 --> 20:18.670
of my brother's dealing
with the Pamunkey.

20:22.510 --> 20:24.830
You'll never be a friend
of the Sharrows, Doctor.

20:24.910 --> 20:27.430
I wish to serve the colony,
not the governor.

20:27.510 --> 20:29.110
Hup! Hup!

20:31.390 --> 20:33.390
Hello.

20:36.870 --> 20:40.350
Winganuske will come back to you.
If that is what she wishes.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.990
She will give you another child.

20:46.030 --> 20:48.030
Please, tell her...

20:51.230 --> 20:53.390
Tell her I will make
the house ready for her.

20:55.310 --> 20:57.310
I'll be a good husband.

21:09.790 --> 21:12.630
"Do no harm. Wait."

21:14.510 --> 21:16.510
He'll know what I mean.

21:16.590 --> 21:18.550
I will bring Winganuske to you...

21:19.670 --> 21:21.670
..when she is ready.

21:31.590 --> 21:34.590
It's too late for dinner now.

Let me have a piece
of that pie, won't you?

21:53.190 --> 21:56.270
Get away, child. Have I not warned
you, you're not welcome near me?

21:56.350 --> 21:59.590
I'll tell you something worth knowing
if you give me a bite.

21:59.670 --> 22:02.150
What could you know?
The Negroes is going

22:02.230 --> 22:04.190
to stow away in a ship

22:04.270 --> 22:06.630
when the St George feast
is happening, they are.

22:07.790 --> 22:09.790

22:18.150 --> 22:20.150
Tell not to a soul
what you have told us

22:20.230 --> 22:22.550
and there will be
more treats for you, Little Tam.

22:30.030 --> 22:32.630
Maria, come.

22:32.710 --> 22:34.750
Do not offend our ancestors
by asking them to do

22:34.830 --> 22:37.190
Yeardley's bidding.
I do not do it

22:37.270 --> 22:39.790
for that cruel madman.

22:39.870 --> 22:41.830
I do it for you.

22:43.350 --> 22:46.710
I did not ask them
to show me Yeardley in my visions.

22:48.270 --> 22:51.230
I live in fear
that I will see you killing him.

22:51.310 --> 22:53.710
Maria...
That is why, Pedro,

22:55.430 --> 22:57.590
I have found a way
that we can hide on a ship

22:57.670 --> 22:59.630
to take us to England.

23:00.670 --> 23:02.670
We will go on the day of the feast.

23:18.990 --> 23:21.670
I will not go to England.

23:21.750 --> 23:23.710
This way we can be together.

23:24.750 --> 23:26.750
Isn't that what you want?

23:26.830 --> 23:29.230
You have decided all of this, Maria.

23:29.310 --> 23:31.270
You have arranged all of this

23:31.350 --> 23:33.590
without speaking to me
to see what I say.

23:33.670 --> 23:35.670
Will your pride let you stay here

23:35.750 --> 23:37.710
when you know
what will become of us?

23:37.790 --> 23:39.750
Ahh...

23:41.190 --> 23:43.190
Look.

23:43.270 --> 23:48.230
They came here with us.
They suffer as we do.

23:48.310 --> 23:52.510
If we escape,
they will be punished for it.

23:52.590 --> 23:55.910
They will be put into chains.
They will be lashed.

you refuse.

to trot out some gossip, girl?

37:07.950 --> 37:09.950
Psst.

37:14.550 --> 37:18.030
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING, LAUGHTER)

37:28.990 --> 37:30.990
(CROWD CHEERING)

37:34.310 --> 37:38.710
This is the story
of England's greatness!

37:38.790 --> 37:40.750
(CROWD CHEERING)

37:43.990 --> 37:45.990
Take this report to your king.

37:47.070 --> 37:49.990
And if you give shelter

37:50.070 --> 37:53.470
to the man who would kill
the governor of Virginia,

37:53.550 --> 37:56.310
then there will never
be peace between us.

37:57.830 --> 38:03.670
You advise Opechancanough
that he must banish Silas Sharrow...

38:05.190 --> 38:07.190
..or we will be eternal enemies.

38:15.910 --> 38:17.910
(BOTH SPEAK INDISTINCTLY)

38:21.190 --> 38:23.190
Come.
(BIRDS CAWING)

38:40.750 --> 38:43.910
Give it here.
Hey, where's Pedro?

38:43.990 --> 38:46.390
You will see
how he treasures his master.

38:46.470 --> 38:49.630
Where's Pedro? I must honour
this true servant of mine.

38:49.710 --> 38:51.670
He'll be the one to raise the flag.

38:53.310 --> 38:55.310
Where's Pedro?

39:08.150 --> 39:10.150
(GASPS)

39:10.230 --> 39:12.190
You must return to the feast.

39:12.270 --> 39:14.990
The Governor is seeking Pedro,
that he might be the one

39:15.070 --> 39:17.470
to raise the flag.
You'll be found if you stay here.

39:17.550 --> 39:19.910
Some mariner will betray you
before the ship sails.

39:20.950 --> 39:23.110
I am truly sorry, Maria.
(SIGHS)

39:25.110 --> 39:27.670
I will return to him,

39:27.750 --> 39:29.710
but not bend with defeat.

39:30.750 --> 39:33.630
I will speak my thoughts

39:33.710 --> 39:35.670
and he will hear them.

39:36.670 --> 39:38.670
Let us see who obeys.

39:46.830 --> 39:50.110
This honour, I give to you,
my princely servant.

39:51.590 --> 39:55.150
You will lift
the emblem of St George,

39:55.230 --> 39:57.470
so that it flies over us, always.

39:58.470 --> 40:01.070
A mark of England's mission here.

40:02.070 --> 40:04.070
Hoist the holy banner, Pedro.

40:29.550 --> 40:31.550
Have I not told you
what to do, Pedro?

40:42.270 --> 40:44.270
Pedro.

40:47.150 --> 40:49.830
You wish to honour me, Governor?

40:49.910 --> 40:51.950
It is only one thing I want.

40:52.030 --> 40:55.750
Raise the flag, Pedro!
I want to remain here.

40:55.830 --> 40:57.830
With Maria.

41:00.110 --> 41:02.150
Raise the flag.

41:02.230 --> 41:04.990
The man who saved your life
only wants one thing.

41:06.150 --> 41:08.150
Will you grant that to me?

41:21.350 --> 41:23.350
Raise the flag,

41:23.430 --> 41:27.350
and you may stay on my farm
with your woman.

41:50.990 --> 41:52.990
I still wish to know
your company better.

41:53.990 --> 41:55.990
I will not seek to deceive you.

41:57.390 --> 42:00.150
I suspect, well enough,
why you are here in Jamestown.

42:01.830 --> 42:03.830
I fear, well enough, what it is

42:03.910 --> 42:06.110
you have discovered about me
since you've been here.

42:10.670 --> 42:12.670
We will be friends, sir,

42:14.670 --> 42:16.870
you and I.

42:16.950 --> 42:19.590
I wish for you to know me more
that you might appreciate

42:19.670 --> 42:22.270
my predicament, my motives,

42:22.350 --> 42:24.310
my truest nature.

42:26.870 --> 42:30.110
How might I earn your trust, Wilmus?

43:22.270 --> 43:26.150
From this day, we will call it what
it is. We are his slaves.

43:26.230 --> 43:29.070
I was wounded at war, sir.
Your wounds are of the womb.

43:29.150 --> 43:31.110
There lies our destinies, too.

43:31.190 --> 43:34.870
My heart's true wish
is to utterly unseat Yeardley.

43:34.950 --> 43:38.070
Family comes before everything
for us Sharrows.

43:38.150 --> 43:41.310
I want my brother returned
to our farm.

43:41.390 --> 43:43.350
My pa was a drunk like this.

43:43.430 --> 43:46.030
And the cruellest tongue
of the devil itself.

43:46.110 --> 43:49.110
But he paid for it,
and so will you, Meredith Rutter.

43:49.190 --> 43:51.150
I swear.

43:53.110 --> 43:55.510
