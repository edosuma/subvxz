01:06.152 --> 01:08.713
Some people you just never forget.

01:09.239 --> 01:11.712
It's like they get burned into your brain.

01:14.393 --> 01:16.879
Other people make no impression at all.

01:17.581 --> 01:19.192
It's like they're there...

01:19.582 --> 01:20.775
and then they're not.

01:23.964 --> 01:26.084
- Call it.
- That one, sleeping.

01:27.523 --> 01:29.459
That's not a person under there.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.075
- Is too, curled up.
- Where are the legs?

01:32.228 --> 01:33.636
Maybe he doesn't have any.

01:33.713 --> 01:35.393
- Roxy.
- What?

01:35.573 --> 01:38.055
Not everybody makes it through life intact.

01:38.218 --> 01:42.121
We all didn't get a cozy, comfortable life in the suburbs, little girl.

01:42.693 --> 01:45.729
Cozy, maybe. Comfortable, never.

01:45.888 --> 01:48.413
Clock is ticking. Make your pick.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.603
He looks like a Simms.

01:54.649 --> 01:57.573
Go ask him-- maybe he'll give you a bite of his squirrel kebab.

02:04.689 --> 02:08.902
Um... hi, everyone. Good morning.

02:09.777 --> 02:14.673
I'm looking for a mister or miss A. Simms.

02:16.296 --> 02:17.565
A. Simms?

02:18.032 --> 02:19.814
Who is A. Simms?

02:20.135 --> 02:21.878
Bueller? Anyone?

02:21.944 --> 02:25.107
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?

02:25.153 --> 02:27.975
We didn't do anything. You can't cite us.

02:28.031 --> 02:30.504
Relax. I'm on a mission of mercy.

02:30.642 --> 02:31.886
A. Simms.

02:31.990 --> 02:35.610
We have a missing persons report that needs to be confirmed.

02:35.768 --> 02:37.339
Your have rich...

02:37.790 --> 02:39.459
and loving relatives

02:39.624 --> 02:41.011
that think you're dead.

02:42.334 --> 02:43.515
What the fuck?

02:51.988 --> 02:52.828
Shit.

03:03.139 --> 03:04.097
Ew.

03:05.387 --> 03:08.429
I've always said littering should be a capital offense.

03:09.007 --> 03:10.763
People. People, back up.

03:10.856 --> 03:12.432
This is a crime scene.

03:12.572 --> 03:13.518
Montana?

03:14.132 --> 03:15.336
Is it Montana?

03:15.438 --> 03:16.436
Who's Montana?

03:17.210 --> 03:18.496
I'm Montana.

03:21.797 --> 03:22.647
Shit!

03:22.754 --> 03:25.827
Roxy, what just happened? I got the wrong guy!

03:26.297 --> 03:27.245
No I.D.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.128
Where the hell is A. Simms?

03:30.445 --> 03:32.232
I was Arthur Simms.

03:33.666 --> 03:34.448
What?

03:35.037 --> 03:37.521
But I haven't used that name since I was 19.

03:37.602 --> 03:39.149
Well, he's John Doe now.

03:39.430 --> 03:41.089
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:41.157 --> 03:42.523
We get these guys every day.

03:42.611 --> 03:44.961
No I.D., nobody to claim their bodies.

03:45.170 --> 03:46.758
What happens to them?

03:47.004 --> 03:49.395
Unmarked graves, courtesy of the county.

03:50.327 --> 03:51.232
Harsh.

03:51.509 --> 03:54.253
George, everybody can't get a monument,

03:54.294 --> 03:56.747
or else the world'd be one big-ass graveyard.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.886
- You hungry?
- Give me your pen.

04:05.670 --> 04:06.655
George...

04:10.490 --> 04:12.753
George. This is not your problem.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.334
Not anymore.

04:15.977 --> 04:17.822
John Doe, my ass.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.873
- Feel good about yourself now?
- I do.

04:23.391 --> 04:24.212
Hey!

04:24.769 --> 04:26.270
Hey, put that back!

04:27.605 --> 04:30.170
Hello! Officer? He's stealing.

04:30.242 --> 04:31.436
Tell him to put it back.

04:31.552 --> 04:32.378
No, don't.

04:32.655 --> 04:34.195
It gets cold out here.

04:34.609 --> 04:35.475
He needs it.

04:35.772 --> 04:37.237
He needs it more than I do.

04:37.671 --> 04:39.412
Good for you, Arthur Simms.

04:41.153 --> 04:42.806
Circle of life, baby.

04:49.084 --> 04:50.630
Big smiles, everyone.

04:50.732 --> 04:52.407
Let's see that Lincoln spirit.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.900
Mr. Hammond... on my signal.

04:55.622 --> 04:57.660
Steven Peale, quit horsing around.

04:57.783 --> 05:00.538
Face forward, please. Thank you.

05:01.362 --> 05:05.023
Reggie Lass, I know you have a smile in there somewhere!

05:07.178 --> 05:10.936
Well, class, I guess we'll all just have to keep standing here

05:10.972 --> 05:13.696
until miss lass decides to get with the program.

05:14.382 --> 05:18.171
Lass! Tell her you don't negotiate with terrorists.

05:18.248 --> 05:20.097
Sandy, I know you're new here,

05:20.162 --> 05:21.945
so I'm going to cut you some slack, but--

05:22.006 --> 05:23.773
"Sandy" is my white slave me.

05:23.869 --> 05:25.512
I have a right to be called "Raven".

05:25.627 --> 05:26.911
I'm Raven.

05:28.099 --> 05:30.218
Okay, mr. Hammond... on three.

05:30.362 --> 05:31.207
One...

05:31.749 --> 05:32.538
Two...

05:32.676 --> 05:35.446
Why should she smile? Isn't her sister dead?

05:44.727 --> 05:47.439
Howard Hughes died a derelict, you know.

05:48.093 --> 05:51.396
He hadn't cut his fingernails or toenails for five years.

05:51.508 --> 05:53.040
Rich people have all the fun.

05:53.172 --> 05:55.609
I saw a picture. He was nasty.

05:55.665 --> 05:58.144
No, not when I knew him. He was quirky, but handsome.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.613
When Howard Hughes died,

06:00.447 --> 06:03.515
400 people claimed to be his heirs.

06:03.591 --> 06:04.676
Did you get much, Daisy?

06:06.514 --> 06:09.249
22 liars split $2 billion.

06:09.305 --> 06:10.627
$2 billion? Billion?

06:10.913 --> 06:15.839
That's--hang on. That's $2 billion divided by 22 people, that equals...

06:17.789 --> 06:19.566
that equals a fuckload of money each.

06:19.658 --> 06:22.910
George, you should go to the morgue and give John Doe his name back.

06:22.956 --> 06:24.774
Tried that already. It didn't work.

06:24.835 --> 06:27.717
Well, we could be distant relations. He could be loaded.

06:27.774 --> 06:29.509
We need to get down there. I'll go with you.

06:29.571 --> 06:31.410
You have no business down at that morgue.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.130
I have no business down at that morgue?

06:33.171 --> 06:34.849
All of our business is down at that morgue.

06:34.917 --> 06:38.336
George, please just do your job.

06:38.392 --> 06:41.675
Those are very strong words for a boss who went A.W.O.L.

06:41.710 --> 06:44.383
When are you going to show us those slides from your vacation?

06:45.163 --> 06:47.937
Or was it a business trip?

06:48.807 --> 06:50.410
I think we're done talking about me.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.007
We never started talking about you.

06:52.043 --> 06:55.290
Well, then you'll have to begin without the benefit of my participation.

06:56.775 --> 06:59.057
I have real business to attend to.

07:02.969 --> 07:04.335
- You know what?
- What?

07:04.690 --> 07:06.768
Go to the fucking morgue if you want to.

07:07.003 --> 07:10.527
Slide your dead drunken ass into a drawer with some other dead drunk.

07:11.110 --> 07:14.597
Take a nap in a body bag. I don't care.

07:16.338 --> 07:17.510
He's changed, isn't he?

07:17.556 --> 07:20.326
Yeah. Where did he go on those days off?

07:21.002 --> 07:21.923
Roxy?

07:22.860 --> 07:24.114
He didn't tell me shit.

07:24.745 --> 07:25.744
Anyway, he's gone.

07:25.819 --> 07:29.444
George, you need to learn a few things about the John Does of this world--

07:29.511 --> 07:32.717
Forget it. I work today, and Millie has used up all her excuses.

07:32.747 --> 07:36.890
So tell Millie to get down to the morgue at lunchtime, like normal working people.

07:36.946 --> 07:39.419
I actually have to work today, myself...

07:39.940 --> 07:41.621
Doing what I was meant to do.

07:41.748 --> 07:42.476
Hooker?

07:43.012 --> 07:45.323
I'm acting. On a T.V. Show.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.667
Are you sleeping with the producer?

07:48.056 --> 07:49.239
That's between me and him.

07:49.315 --> 07:50.242
I hope so.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.133
So are you?

07:51.431 --> 07:52.966
Are you sleeping with Ray?

07:53.075 --> 07:56.637
George... I'm not the kind of girl that likes to kiss and tell.

07:56.699 --> 07:58.702
- Since when?
- Since now.

07:58.808 --> 08:00.591
I'd love to see you act, Daisy.

08:01.404 --> 08:03.477
Then you should come down. Ray would love to see you.

08:03.539 --> 08:04.267
I will.

08:04.435 --> 08:05.485
And you, too, George.

08:05.562 --> 08:07.800
I'm not interested. Didn't care for Ray much.

08:07.861 --> 08:09.252
Yeah, ray is an asshole, isn't he?

08:09.730 --> 08:10.794
I have to go to work.

08:11.167 --> 08:12.714
Georgie-- me, you...

08:12.893 --> 08:14.096
down at the morgue,

08:14.184 --> 08:15.459
mining for gold.

08:15.624 --> 08:16.667
Go there yourself.

08:16.754 --> 08:17.886
I don't know what he looks like.

08:17.942 --> 08:20.271
Always looking for a quick way to make a buck.

08:20.415 --> 08:21.218
Okay.

08:22.145 --> 08:23.533
Poor man, though, eh?

08:24.035 --> 08:25.468
Poor John Doe.

08:26.286 --> 08:27.107
Anonymous...

08:27.615 --> 08:28.468
sad.

08:30.123 --> 08:31.413
Dust to dust.

08:36.215 --> 08:38.379
We just got a John Doe in here about 20 minutes ago.

08:38.427 --> 08:39.251
Score.

08:40.203 --> 08:43.854
I just want to warn you, seeing a lifeless body can be very difficult.

08:44.679 --> 08:45.329
Thank you.

08:45.728 --> 08:49.050
That's why we're here together, for each other.

09:08.009 --> 09:09.464
Uh... Mason?

09:11.933 --> 09:12.758
Mason!

09:13.366 --> 09:14.821
Wake up!

09:15.927 --> 09:19.209
- Mason!
- What? What?

09:22.930 --> 09:24.334
My mistake.

09:26.715 --> 09:27.712
I'm sorry.

09:28.059 --> 09:31.753
My brother here is just in a state of shock.

09:31.932 --> 09:33.918
We were very close.

09:34.390 --> 09:36.269
He was like an uncle to me.

09:37.723 --> 09:39.392
I thought he was your uncle.

09:40.211 --> 09:42.131
But so much more.

09:56.068 --> 10:00.000
Don't make me look at him.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.397
Hold me. Hold me.

10:02.647 --> 10:07.301
I can't bear to see uncle Arthur this way.

10:09.299 --> 10:11.504
It's not him...

10:16.056 --> 10:17.366
I knew that.

10:17.958 --> 10:18.834
Heh...

10:20.735 --> 10:21.506
Mate?

10:22.319 --> 10:25.522
How many fucking John Does do you got in this fucking freezer?

10:26.006 --> 10:27.080
Five.

10:38.831 --> 10:41.678
Well? Do we have a winner?

10:45.867 --> 10:48.389
I'm crying on the inside.

10:49.870 --> 10:54.457
Anyway, does it say there if my uncle left any of his personal effects at the scene?

10:55.332 --> 10:58.424
What? In his shopping cart or his sleeping bag?

10:58.553 --> 11:00.439
Nothing of value, if that's what you're shooting at.

11:00.525 --> 11:02.644
Shut up. You're a fucking liar.

11:03.749 --> 11:05.748
Nothing but the clothes on his back.

11:07.726 --> 11:10.284
All right then, thank you. Bye. Coming, Georgie?

11:10.826 --> 11:12.294
I thought your name was Millie.

11:13.415 --> 11:14.235
Hagen.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.525
- It is.
- It is?

11:18.826 --> 11:24.035
I think I'm going to stay a moment. Say a proper goodbye.

11:29.648 --> 11:32.745
It's not my job  to say who lives and dies,

11:33.195 --> 11:37.915
and it sure as shit isn't my job  to give anybody a little dignity when they do.

11:38.540 --> 11:40.219
My job sucks.

11:53.740 --> 11:54.904
Miss Hagen?

11:55.765 --> 11:56.775
Miss Hagen?

11:57.113 --> 11:58.406
Fuck, that's me.

11:58.508 --> 11:59.246
Oh, yes?

11:59.717 --> 12:02.661
Is this the correct address to send the bill for the burial costs?

12:02.820 --> 12:05.774
- What burial costs?
- $400.

12:05.984 --> 12:08.780
- Why am I getting hit with this?
- You're the next of kin.

12:09.092 --> 12:12.347
If he had been a John Doe, the county would assume the costs, but he's not.

12:12.953 --> 12:16.992
He's Arthur Simms. And he's got family.

12:19.834 --> 12:22.788
No... he doesn't.

12:23.140 --> 12:25.670
He doesn't have anyone.

12:25.839 --> 12:27.156
Oh, now I get it.

12:27.222 --> 12:30.176
Generosity is for people who can afford it.

12:32.491 --> 12:34.201
I should have seen this coming.

12:34.635 --> 12:37.052
I was always good on initial impulse.

12:37.816 --> 12:40.786
I never earned any badges for follow-through.

12:46.520 --> 12:49.489
Georgia, you said you wanted to do this.

12:49.539 --> 12:50.328
I did.

12:50.396 --> 12:53.514
You signed up to sell a hundred boxes of cookies.

12:53.575 --> 12:54.824
You do it.

12:55.677 --> 12:58.735
We are going outside to sell these cookies.

12:58.810 --> 12:59.990
It's too hot.

13:01.106 --> 13:02.120
Now.

13:03.145 --> 13:05.090
It's too stressful.

13:05.202 --> 13:06.779
We need to move these.

13:06.856 --> 13:09.776
I just wanted the stupid badge.

13:09.846 --> 13:12.945
You can't get the badge until you sell the cookies.

13:13.640 --> 13:15.270
Screw the badge.

13:15.350 --> 13:16.420
Go to your room.

13:18.157 --> 13:19.789
No dinner for you, young lady.

13:24.111 --> 13:26.191
This doesn't really feel like professional acting, Ray.

13:26.237 --> 13:28.187
I mean, we're setting up in the back of a bar.

13:28.248 --> 13:31.535
Daisy, that's what reality television is. We ambush.

13:31.602 --> 13:34.725
Yeah, I'm just saying it'd be nice to have a set.

13:34.878 --> 13:36.486
Daisy, we have something better than a set.

13:36.542 --> 13:39.548
We have a bar room full of people who have no clue we're filming them.

13:39.598 --> 13:42.025
One of whom you're going to get to play an adulterer.

13:42.371 --> 13:44.489
Trust me, it's going to feel very much like acting.

13:44.581 --> 13:46.368
Tighten up camera two for me, please.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.510
I need a script.

13:47.951 --> 13:50.388
Words to commit to memory. That, to me, is acting.

13:50.451 --> 13:53.417
Okay, here's your script-- pretend you like the guy...

13:53.577 --> 13:54.811
and get him to like you.

13:55.031 --> 13:57.141
- How's that?
- Shakespearean.

13:58.307 --> 14:01.001
Just so you know, I've been in films with major movie stars.

14:01.052 --> 14:02.720
Oh, I'm sure you have.

14:02.905 --> 14:04.227
But, hey, guess what?

14:05.352 --> 14:06.946
Today you're the star.

14:07.501 --> 14:08.359
Huh?

14:08.491 --> 14:09.598
Last looks, please.

14:10.074 --> 14:11.835
Is this a good place for me to sit?

14:12.140 --> 14:13.403
It's perfect, sweetheart.

14:16.006 --> 14:16.955
Come on, folks.

14:17.185 --> 14:19.535
- Let's get this show on the road.
- And out of this dump.

14:21.046 --> 14:23.013
Do you not want to do this, Daisy?

14:23.776 --> 14:26.079
'Cau se if you don't wantto do it, don't.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.389
We'll just stop what we're doing and go home.

14:28.445 --> 14:29.218
Everybody?

14:29.508 --> 14:30.338
Folks.

14:32.755 --> 14:35.167
Say the word. We'll--we'll pack it in.

14:35.285 --> 14:37.109
Come back another day, with another girl.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.728
Really, I can-- I can always get another girl.

14:43.704 --> 14:45.325
How's my lipstick?

14:49.452 --> 14:50.748
You could use a little touch-up.

14:52.490 --> 14:54.147
All right, folks, show time.

14:56.670 --> 14:59.082
Seconds away, people, seconds away.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.468
- Hi, Crystal.
- Hi.

15:02.897 --> 15:05.647
Anything good in your crystal ball?

15:07.521 --> 15:09.895
"Crystal ball."

15:10.174 --> 15:12.554
There's someone waiting for you in the conference room.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.945
What do they want?

15:16.921 --> 15:18.990
It doesn't say.

15:24.607 --> 15:25.467
Hi.

15:25.657 --> 15:26.655
Ms. Hay-gen?

15:26.742 --> 15:27.878
Did I say that right?

15:27.976 --> 15:29.424
Actually, no, it's "Hagen."

15:29.506 --> 15:31.253
As in "-dazs."

15:32.546 --> 15:34.923
- I'm Mickey.
- Hi, Mickey.

15:37.735 --> 15:38.625
Who are you?

15:38.687 --> 15:41.329
I run the metro south homeless shelter.

15:41.442 --> 15:43.322
Oh. That's nice.

15:43.802 --> 15:47.790
Oh, well, I check on the guys down at the fifth street encampment every few days.

15:47.840 --> 15:52.750
They told me about Montana-- about Arthur Simms, his death,

15:52.858 --> 15:55.138
and then I called the city, and that led me to you.

15:55.209 --> 15:56.024
Shit.

15:56.106 --> 16:02.924
Uh, these... these are Montana's belongings.

16:06.239 --> 16:07.160
Wow.

16:08.101 --> 16:12.259
I was... wondering where his stuff went.

16:13.008 --> 16:15.239
- Thank you, Mickey.
- You're welcome.

16:15.326 --> 16:20.118
So you knew... uncle Arthur?

16:20.508 --> 16:23.487
Yeah, a little bit. I certainly didn't know he had any family.

16:23.554 --> 16:26.292
Well, we weren't a close-knit crew.

16:26.629 --> 16:31.111
You know, I always wondered why he called himself "Montana".

16:31.778 --> 16:35.535
I think Montana loved the outdoors.

16:36.005 --> 16:40.440
He was a "big sky" kind of guy, you know?

16:41.141 --> 16:43.328
I know he loved a good barbecue.

16:43.967 --> 16:46.108
You didn't know him at all, did you?

16:46.190 --> 16:47.649
We were planning on getting together.

16:47.736 --> 16:51.924
We had... scheduling issues.

16:51.996 --> 16:54.581
I always wonder how my clients end up where they do--

16:54.643 --> 16:56.138
on the fringes, you know?

16:56.219 --> 16:59.819
And then I run into some family member who doesn't give two shits,

16:59.885 --> 17:02.220
and that's it, the mystery's solved.

17:03.295 --> 17:04.621
I give a shit.

17:05.170 --> 17:06.229
Not two.

17:06.321 --> 17:07.984
Oh, is that why the county's taking care of him?

17:08.069 --> 17:11.031
I just don't have 400 bucks lying around.

17:11.093 --> 17:13.670
Yeah, and since you left him to charity his whole life, why change now?

17:13.730 --> 17:17.585
I'm so sick of you people! Shame on you.

17:18.553 --> 17:21.246
A little heads-up on the dead, Mickey.

17:21.303 --> 17:23.984
Put them in a marble temple, stick them in a coffee can,

17:24.036 --> 17:25.536
either way, they don't care.

17:25.788 --> 17:26.679
They're dead.

17:29.628 --> 17:30.959
I'm going to hell.

17:31.307 --> 17:33.356
Or maybe I'm staying here forever.

17:33.648 --> 17:35.956
Millie, what was that?

17:36.361 --> 17:40.012
Oh, it's nothing, Delores. Just a family thing.

17:40.104 --> 17:42.720
Millie, is he asking you for money?

17:42.792 --> 17:45.326
Because my cousin, Louis, took me for a tidy sum,

17:45.382 --> 17:48.121
never paid it back, and now he lives in Ecuador

17:48.193 --> 17:50.001
with a man servant and everything--

17:50.068 --> 17:52.597
- No, Delores, someone died.
- Someone close?

17:52.668 --> 17:56.238
No, it's just the money's for his burial, and I don't have it.

17:56.288 --> 17:58.305
- How much?
- $400.

17:58.450 --> 18:01.368
Well, silly, all you have to do is ask.

18:01.482 --> 18:02.755
Family emergency.

18:02.918 --> 18:04.752
That's what advances are for, Millie.

18:04.896 --> 18:06.889
I'll get a check cut for you right away.

18:09.016 --> 18:10.733
I didn't know you cared so much.

18:11.767 --> 18:13.133
Neither did I.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.250
Hey, J.D.

18:21.003 --> 18:22.119
Look who's here.

18:22.303 --> 18:23.660
I don't do preppy dogs.

18:25.216 --> 18:27.782
- Well, he's not preppy.
- He is.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.056
Get him away from me.

18:30.736 --> 18:33.178
Mom! Come get J.D.

18:33.318 --> 18:36.169
Reggie, you don't need to shout. I'm right here.

18:38.842 --> 18:41.227
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.053
Guess you don't remember me, mrs. Lass?

18:45.194 --> 18:50.602
Oh, my god... Sandy Simons, is that you under all that eyeliner?

18:50.771 --> 18:51.703
In the flesh.

18:51.887 --> 18:53.848
Oh, I heard you moved back to town.

18:54.786 --> 18:56.926
- How's your mom?
- Divorced.

18:57.018 --> 18:59.573
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Don't be. My dad's a freak.

19:00.310 --> 19:02.266
Come on, Reggie. Let's go online.

19:02.619 --> 19:07.595
So, Sandy... where did you discover this... new look?

19:07.708 --> 19:10.314
Florida. My name's "Raven" now.

19:10.995 --> 19:11.860
Nice.

19:15.670 --> 19:17.953
Mom, can you take J.D., Please?

19:18.046 --> 19:19.966
Why? Don't you want him with you?

19:20.299 --> 19:22.321
No. He's too preppy.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.228
Preppy?

19:24.151 --> 19:25.132
Fine.

19:27.155 --> 19:28.997
Do you girls want something to eat?

19:29.423 --> 19:30.985
Something sweet.

19:31.983 --> 19:34.102
Uh, do you have any charcoal?

19:34.190 --> 19:35.449
No. No, no, girls.

19:35.531 --> 19:36.893
I'm sorry, no matches.

19:36.990 --> 19:38.321
Charcoal eyeliner.

19:38.587 --> 19:39.940
I'm going to do Reggie's make-up.

19:40.389 --> 19:43.559
Oh! Sure. I'll get it.

19:48.182 --> 19:50.826
Oh, don't you worry.

19:51.203 --> 19:53.205
She needs a friend who's human.

19:54.301 --> 19:55.613
Or something close.

20:12.290 --> 20:13.752
Say it ain't so.

20:21.672 --> 20:23.127
Oh, brother.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.767
Truly stunning work, young Rembrandt.

20:28.134 --> 20:29.471
What'd you call me, asshole?

20:29.683 --> 20:30.428
Christ.

20:31.770 --> 20:34.074
I was hoping to pay tribute to your artwork.

20:34.345 --> 20:35.712
Well, I think it's shit.

20:35.788 --> 20:38.887
Always striving. Always pushing to make your work a cut above.

20:38.934 --> 20:40.739
I appreciate that in a young person.

20:40.965 --> 20:42.885
In fact, I'd love to shake your hand.

20:43.667 --> 20:45.343
Start climbing then grandpa.

20:46.428 --> 20:47.959
How about you come down?

20:48.149 --> 20:50.079
The climb up is half the experience.

20:50.560 --> 20:51.947
Falling down the other half?

20:52.444 --> 20:53.678
Maybe for you.

20:54.016 --> 20:54.923
I never fall.

20:55.179 --> 20:56.049
Ever.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.485
I want to pay you for your work.

21:12.013 --> 21:14.173
Call it art appreciation. How about, say...

21:15.352 --> 21:16.724
30 bucks?

21:17.537 --> 21:20.560
Cash on the barrel head, if you come down in the next two minutes.

21:20.907 --> 21:22.872
You Medici motherfucker.

21:23.759 --> 21:25.013
You can't rush art.

21:25.105 --> 21:28.305
I'll make it 40. $40 for an original work by the great "B. Boyd."

21:29.345 --> 21:30.394
What the fuck?

21:31.659 --> 21:33.155
I ain't that hack, man.

21:34.173 --> 21:35.862
I'm up here blotting his shit out.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.219
What the fuck, indeed.

21:41.883 --> 21:46.435
Get the fuck out of my airspace, motherfucker, before I shoot you down!

21:47.698 --> 21:50.254
Terrible, what people do to other people's property.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.015
Shit! Heads up!

21:56.086 --> 21:58.319
Tag. You're it.

21:58.385 --> 21:59.159
B-boy!

21:59.303 --> 22:00.439
B-boy, get up, man!

22:00.653 --> 22:01.519
Get up!

22:04.716 --> 22:06.777
Damn, look at that pattern.

22:09.048 --> 22:10.607
Watch your step now.

22:13.225 --> 22:16.070
I have to say I'm a little nervous about this.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.621
There's nothing to be nervous about.

22:17.699 --> 22:19.966
I just feel like it's underhanded,

22:20.019 --> 22:21.805
filming a guy who's cheating his wife.

22:21.862 --> 22:24.641
Hey, hey, hey... his wife's the one that contacted us.

22:24.774 --> 22:26.551
She thinks this is where he comes to pick up women.

22:26.597 --> 22:27.944
Don't make me out to be the bad guy.

22:28.001 --> 22:30.497
I'm not. So how do I look?

22:31.005 --> 22:32.536
Good enough to end a marriage.

22:32.618 --> 22:33.771
Where are the cameras?

22:35.009 --> 22:38.669
There. There. There and there.

22:38.742 --> 22:40.774
- Any more questions?
- No. You?

22:41.516 --> 22:42.331
Yeah.

22:43.392 --> 22:45.239
Are you sure you know how to seduce a man?

22:45.367 --> 22:46.519
I don't know.

22:46.748 --> 22:47.875
Do I?

22:51.557 --> 22:52.555
We'll see.

22:59.279 --> 23:01.920
- Everything pink goes?
- Burn it.

23:02.667 --> 23:04.030
Is that her?

23:07.071 --> 23:08.489
Yeah. That's my sister.

23:09.231 --> 23:11.637
It's the only yearbook picture of her I ever found.

23:11.715 --> 23:13.747
She was too cool for that bullshit.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.738
She was never in any clubs or anything.

23:16.855 --> 23:18.606
Not being in stuff is cool.

23:18.720 --> 23:22.901
Not like my sister, president of the "my shit doesn't stink society."

23:24.516 --> 23:26.752
Can I see her room?

23:26.890 --> 23:28.718
Your order, ladies.

23:30.234 --> 23:32.462
Looks good, Reggie.

23:34.802 --> 23:35.789
Thanks.

23:36.009 --> 23:37.580
Her name's not "Reggie" anymore.

23:37.878 --> 23:39.179
Dare I ask?

23:39.280 --> 23:40.289
It's "Spider".

23:40.362 --> 23:43.229
Spider, huh? That's pretty.

23:45.493 --> 23:47.924
Um, you know, we don't have a lot of sweets in the house,

23:48.005 --> 23:50.192
but I did find these.

23:50.433 --> 23:51.769
I think those are really stale.

23:51.846 --> 23:54.882
That's okay, I like stale. It's closer to death.

23:56.136 --> 23:59.070
Well, try not to get a lot of crumbs on the floor.

24:03.555 --> 24:05.931
So, um, well, you girls, have fun.

24:06.264 --> 24:11.144
Um, would you like to ask Raven over for dinner... spider?

24:12.653 --> 24:13.575
Sure.

24:13.693 --> 24:14.553
Terrific.

24:14.798 --> 24:16.673
Can we invite a couple of friends?

24:17.471 --> 24:19.166
Of course. Yeah.

24:19.520 --> 24:20.512
Can we have pizza?

24:21.814 --> 24:23.334
Pizza it is.

24:28.536 --> 24:31.823
- Your mom's cool.
- Not really.

24:34.221 --> 24:35.504
Come here much?

24:35.996 --> 24:37.987
Isn't that supposed to be a man's line?

24:38.575 --> 24:40.276
I didn't know there was a script.

24:40.618 --> 24:42.385
Want to hear my guess about you, Walter?

24:42.437 --> 24:44.586
Uh-oh... now I'm getting nervous.

24:45.915 --> 24:48.531
- Another shot of courage, my friend?
- Thank you.

24:48.872 --> 24:49.748
How about you, miss?

24:49.836 --> 24:52.282
- No, I'm good.
- Well, that's good to know.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.761
My guess, Walter, is that you're supposed to be at home right now,

24:57.960 --> 25:02.641
but you work a long day, and the wife isn't always a welcome face at the end of it.

25:03.526 --> 25:04.674
I should get going.

25:08.104 --> 25:09.665
You have a nice neck.

25:10.552 --> 25:11.739
It's strong.

25:13.516 --> 25:15.645
Does your wife kiss your neck, Walter?

25:16.265 --> 25:17.206
She should.

25:17.263 --> 25:17.882
Jesus.

25:17.959 --> 25:18.903
Jesus.

25:18.968 --> 25:21.835
I'm sorry. I'm making you uncomfortable.

25:22.390 --> 25:25.809
You're the kind of guy that believes in staying with somebody forever.

25:25.860 --> 25:28.421
I gave up on forever. It doesn't last.

25:29.914 --> 25:33.416
I'm a big fan of just one really good night.

25:34.958 --> 25:36.878
Are you a good kisser, Walter?

25:37.570 --> 25:40.078
Um... I don't know.

25:41.342 --> 25:43.094
I bet you would be.

25:44.838 --> 25:45.962
I'm sorry.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.675
I'm not a cheater.

25:51.731 --> 25:53.360
You're not, are you?

25:54.794 --> 25:55.905
No.

25:57.154 --> 25:58.453
Top you up there, pal?

25:59.003 --> 25:59.811
I'm fine.

26:00.911 --> 26:02.141
I'll be right back.

26:04.234 --> 26:05.074
Watch my bag?

26:13.995 --> 26:15.161
What are you doing?

26:15.484 --> 26:17.232
He doesn't want to cheat.

26:17.285 --> 26:19.524
- Really? How do you know that?
- Because he said so.

26:19.595 --> 26:21.864
Men say a lot of fucking things, Daisy, all day long,

26:21.920 --> 26:23.230
but mostly at night.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.457
- Or maybe you don't know men.
- I know men fine.

26:26.948 --> 26:28.479
This guy is clueless.

26:28.899 --> 26:30.198
He wants to be told what to do.

26:30.249 --> 26:31.888
He wants to be told what he wants.

26:31.959 --> 26:32.974
What does he want?

26:33.481 --> 26:35.139
He wants what we all want.

26:35.432 --> 26:37.295
He wants to feel alive.

26:38.226 --> 26:39.634
Right, Daisy?

26:40.736 --> 26:41.933
I don't know.

26:41.994 --> 26:43.950
He's not a cheater, I can see it.

26:44.888 --> 26:47.362
So what are you, a fucking marriage counselor now?

26:47.458 --> 26:49.434
- No.
- No.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.702
You're an actress.

26:51.822 --> 26:54.088
Act like you want to make him happy.

26:54.583 --> 26:57.570
Act like you want to make me happy.

26:58.359 --> 26:59.071
Fine.

27:00.317 --> 27:02.531
- Am I being hard on you?
- Yes.

27:02.900 --> 27:06.054
I'm an awful guy. I'm mean. I'm terrible.

27:06.408 --> 27:08.885
- You really are.
- I really am.

27:15.782 --> 27:17.282
Now go out there...

27:18.025 --> 27:19.945
and show him no mercy.

27:21.865 --> 27:23.380
- All right?
- Mm.

27:24.496 --> 27:26.078
All right, Millie.

27:26.571 --> 27:29.673
Here you go. $400.

27:30.339 --> 27:32.038
Thank you, Delores.

27:32.105 --> 27:34.358
For your uncle's burial. Uncle Arthur, was it?

27:34.444 --> 27:35.141
Right.

27:35.299 --> 27:38.787
The good news was I had a check  for 400 bucks.

27:39.088 --> 27:40.681
The bad news was...

27:40.799 --> 27:43.149
I was thinking about keeping the money.

27:43.205 --> 27:45.556
This is a sweet thing you're doing--

27:45.612 --> 27:47.901
working overtime to pay him tribute.

27:48.018 --> 27:50.727
That's what we do for family, I guess.

27:50.900 --> 27:52.450
I was working for it,

27:52.544 --> 27:55.954
so why should I spend it on some guy just because he's dead?

27:56.277 --> 27:57.500
I'm dead, too.

27:57.576 --> 27:58.857
Honoring the dead

27:59.421 --> 28:01.632
helps us go on living.

28:01.873 --> 28:02.989
I know.

28:03.061 --> 28:06.179
One hot leather jacket, and no one would be the wiser.

28:06.265 --> 28:08.791
The thing that's lovely about this gesture

28:08.851 --> 28:11.755
is that you're not just looking for a pat on the back.

28:11.831 --> 28:14.022
On my hot new leather jacket.

28:14.224 --> 28:15.031
Right.

28:15.272 --> 28:17.837
That's the way I feel about my kids.

28:19.276 --> 28:20.320
What kids?

28:20.392 --> 28:22.123
The little ones I sponsor.

28:22.527 --> 28:23.207
Oh!

28:25.282 --> 28:26.562
Say hello to...

28:26.654 --> 28:27.703
Kasawala.

28:28.190 --> 28:30.238
And Anjali.

28:30.468 --> 28:31.369
And...

28:32.610 --> 28:34.478
this is Ching-Zi.

28:34.595 --> 28:36.417
I saw her picture in my sunday parade,

28:36.463 --> 28:38.809
and I just couldn't resist adding one more.

28:39.024 --> 28:40.462
And this...

28:41.495 --> 28:43.213
I'm not supposed to play favorites.

28:44.518 --> 28:45.751
This is Fallanda.

28:45.966 --> 28:47.534
Isn't she beautiful?

28:47.636 --> 28:49.639
$15 a month from yours truly

28:49.695 --> 28:52.786
gets her a monthly supply of high-protein lunches,

28:52.899 --> 28:54.697
and her village gets a water pump.

28:55.316 --> 28:57.436
That's so sweet, Delores.

28:57.497 --> 29:01.659
Oh. I mean, she'll never thank me in person,

29:01.715 --> 29:04.203
but that's not what's important, as you know.

29:06.385 --> 29:10.154
Thank you, Delores Herbig, and your big, brown eyes.

29:12.059 --> 29:13.108
Right.

29:13.180 --> 29:17.061
The important thing is when life presents us with an opportunity

29:17.291 --> 29:21.480
to help someone who can't help themselves, we have to step up,

29:22.002 --> 29:23.931
and that's what you're doing right now.

29:23.988 --> 29:27.802
And just like that, I lost my hot new leather jacket.

29:28.172 --> 29:32.042
Thank you for the fine example you set.

29:33.471 --> 29:35.524
Hey... this is nice.

29:35.780 --> 29:38.207
I lost my other jacket when I died.

29:38.796 --> 29:40.603
Thank you, Georgia Lass.

29:41.617 --> 29:43.030
You're welcome.

29:46.471 --> 29:48.181
Pretty girl you were talking to.

29:48.570 --> 29:49.595
Seems nice.

29:49.856 --> 29:50.955
Oh, I don't think so.

29:51.539 --> 29:53.787
I don't think that one's so nice.

29:54.242 --> 29:55.308
Well, you never know.

29:55.882 --> 29:58.031
Wouldn't you just kill to find out, though?

29:58.324 --> 29:59.931
God, I know I would.

30:01.970 --> 30:03.075
Excuse me.

30:05.912 --> 30:07.780
Good evening, sir. What are you doing here?

30:07.843 --> 30:09.793
I've come to see Daisy act. Where are the cameras?

30:09.875 --> 30:11.805
They're hidden, and shut the fuck up.

30:12.086 --> 30:14.743
- Excuse me?
- Shut the fuck up.

30:14.999 --> 30:16.818
And don't talk to her when she comes down here.

30:16.909 --> 30:17.656
Fine.

30:18.395 --> 30:20.888
The only reason you have to open your mouth is to pour booze in it.

30:20.985 --> 30:21.758
You understand?

30:22.218 --> 30:23.878
And what are we drinking to, Ray?

30:24.030 --> 30:25.251
They're both for you.

30:27.789 --> 30:29.832
- Looking good, Daisy.
- Not now, Mason.

30:31.482 --> 30:33.539
I'm not going to fucking tell you again.

30:36.148 --> 30:37.765
Well, look who's still here.

30:39.243 --> 30:40.871
You asked me to watch your bag.

30:41.108 --> 30:44.214
Oh. Lucky me. I found a boy scout.

30:44.834 --> 30:47.963
Okay, go home, boy scout. You did your good deed.

30:51.511 --> 30:54.659
You know what everybody says on their deathbed, Walter?

30:55.623 --> 30:57.733
They wish they'd had more fun.

30:59.452 --> 31:02.446
And men wish they'd had more women.

31:05.008 --> 31:07.342
Five reasons men come to a bar, Walter.

31:07.722 --> 31:08.489
One...

31:08.581 --> 31:10.280
they don't love their wife anymore.

31:10.496 --> 31:13.292
Two, their wife doesn't love them.

31:14.752 --> 31:17.015
Three, they want to see what they're missing.

31:17.362 --> 31:21.469
And four, they want, if just for a moment,

31:21.797 --> 31:22.993
to taste it.

31:24.484 --> 31:25.525
Five...

31:36.854 --> 31:38.672
maybe there were just four.

31:41.498 --> 31:43.777
You want to go somewhere with me, Walter?

31:47.329 --> 31:48.461
I do.

31:49.214 --> 31:52.185
Blackstone hotel. Get us a room.

31:52.399 --> 31:53.535
I'll follow.

31:53.874 --> 31:55.378
- Now?
- Now.

31:56.029 --> 31:57.754
Um, I have to pay my bar tab.

31:57.820 --> 32:00.561
No, I got it. Go the hotel, boy scout.

32:15.866 --> 32:17.451
How's that for no mercy?

32:18.029 --> 32:19.673
Jimmy, Blackstone hotel, now.

32:19.907 --> 32:20.871
I'm not going there.

32:21.517 --> 32:22.581
No, you're not,

32:22.843 --> 32:24.577
though it sure seemed like you wanted to.

32:25.033 --> 32:26.703
What the fuck was that kiss?

32:27.256 --> 32:29.703
I was just playing the part, Ray, going with it.

32:29.749 --> 32:31.470
- A little too well.
- You're hurting me.

32:31.527 --> 32:34.343
Well, maybe I'm just playing the part of the jealous boyfriend.

32:37.517 --> 32:40.313
I'm sorry. See? See what you do to me?

32:40.984 --> 32:42.934
You are a hell of an actress.

32:43.699 --> 32:44.568
Thank you.

32:45.392 --> 32:46.252
Come here.

32:51.090 --> 32:52.953
- I'll see you later tonight?
- Okay.

32:57.516 --> 32:59.006
Good seeing you, Mason.

33:05.877 --> 33:06.733
What was that?

33:06.783 --> 33:07.849
I was acting.

33:07.900 --> 33:10.997
Acting like what, a whore?

33:11.310 --> 33:13.654
Because it was bloody brilliant, definitive.

33:13.726 --> 33:15.379
You're drunk, Mason, and you smell.

33:15.437 --> 33:16.495
You smell.

33:17.085 --> 33:19.434
He smells. This whole bloody thing smells.

33:19.655 --> 33:20.566
Go home.

33:29.514 --> 33:33.505
I just wanted to say you were really great.

33:33.961 --> 33:34.958
Thank you.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.358
It's really nice of you to come up and tell me that.

33:38.481 --> 33:43.309
I know some people are shy about approaching actors, but it really makes my day.

33:43.402 --> 33:44.241
What's your name?

33:44.538 --> 33:45.297
Melissa.

33:45.649 --> 33:46.871
I'm his wife.

33:47.534 --> 33:49.177
- Oh.
- "Oh?"

33:49.397 --> 33:50.294
That's it?

33:51.102 --> 33:53.467
That's all I get? That's all you have left?

33:53.606 --> 33:56.432
I didn't know you would be here. They didn't tell me.

33:56.498 --> 33:58.823
Okay. Let's blame them.

34:11.301 --> 34:13.103
So she's dead?

34:13.359 --> 34:14.568
I'm dead.

34:15.443 --> 34:16.245
Ready?

34:16.887 --> 34:18.478
Speak to the spirits.

34:18.985 --> 34:21.520
"Light as a feather, stiff as a board."

34:21.724 --> 34:24.244
"Light as a feather, stiff as a board."

34:24.478 --> 34:27.050
"Light as a feather, stiff as a board."

34:27.152 --> 34:28.246
Sorry to interrupt, girls.

34:28.309 --> 34:29.876
Just thought I'd bring in some sodas.

34:30.435 --> 34:31.310
Mom.

34:31.949 --> 34:34.443
That's cool, mrs. Lass. Thanks.

34:35.542 --> 34:38.472
Would you like to play a game with us?

34:38.585 --> 34:40.971
- No way.
- What are you playing?

34:41.453 --> 34:42.409
Nothing.

34:42.503 --> 34:45.804
Reggie... chill out. Your mom is cool.

34:46.811 --> 34:49.800
Um, why don't you girls levitate without me?

34:53.275 --> 34:55.870
"Light as a feather, stiff as a board."

34:58.025 --> 35:00.791
Wow. Aren't you...

35:01.078 --> 35:03.147
- I mean...
- Aren't I what?

35:04.564 --> 35:05.757
You look good.

35:07.279 --> 35:08.778
Thank you.

35:09.024 --> 35:10.546
I'm going to go take a peek.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.076
If she sees you, she'll freak.

35:14.647 --> 35:15.829
Thanks for inviting me.

35:16.725 --> 35:18.834
If you get caught, I know nothing.

35:19.976 --> 35:22.198
So what exactly is "goth"?

35:22.496 --> 35:23.289
Dad!

35:23.463 --> 35:26.002
You're not supposed to be here. No boys allowed.

35:26.894 --> 35:28.834
- Reggie?
- What?

35:30.657 --> 35:31.871
We're eating in the living room.

35:31.952 --> 35:32.551
Uh, Reggie--

35:32.612 --> 35:34.359
I think the greasy food should stay in the kitchen.

35:34.430 --> 35:37.887
Mom, don't embarrass me. Dad, get out!

35:42.509 --> 35:43.585
What the hell, Joy?

35:44.817 --> 35:49.105
A few simple sacrifices to the devil, followed by pizza.

35:49.426 --> 35:51.193
I'm not comfortable with this.

35:51.767 --> 35:55.095
- It's harmless, all right? A phase.
- How do you know that?

35:56.590 --> 35:58.284
I'm not in love with it,

35:58.709 --> 36:01.096
but it's an actual party, Clancy.

36:01.571 --> 36:03.737
With actual friends.

36:03.851 --> 36:04.931
Reggie has friends?

36:05.771 --> 36:07.751
Reggie has friends.

36:14.109 --> 36:16.062
Wow. Look who's back.

36:16.512 --> 36:18.785
Still panning for gold in dry gulch?

36:19.292 --> 36:20.295
No.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.693
So what's the sad story this time?

36:24.770 --> 36:26.276
I think you'll like this one.

36:26.475 --> 36:27.826
Once upon a time,

36:28.416 --> 36:31.422
there were these four guys named Benjamin,

36:31.550 --> 36:34.540
and they could have turned into a nice leather jacket,

36:34.585 --> 36:39.604
but instead, they ended up on your crummy desk.

36:40.095 --> 36:42.189
I thought Arthur Simms didn't have a family.

36:42.239 --> 36:43.489
He does now.

36:43.903 --> 36:45.184
Complicated guy.

36:45.728 --> 36:48.394
Can I just have a receipt, please?

36:48.645 --> 36:49.921
One second.

36:53.669 --> 36:55.004
Nice frog.

36:56.586 --> 36:58.189
That's general Tsao.

36:59.214 --> 37:00.017
And this...

37:01.354 --> 37:02.813
is Arthur Simms.

37:04.210 --> 37:05.496
You're shitting me?

37:05.542 --> 37:07.922
What'd you think you were getting for $400?

37:07.988 --> 37:10.287
A grave. A headstone.

37:10.354 --> 37:13.218
The city hasn't had funerals for transients for years.

37:13.349 --> 37:14.512
We burn them.

37:15.074 --> 37:17.578
- There's a landfillover by the freeway--
- Yeah, I get it.

37:18.641 --> 37:25.166
No, no, no, no. You paid for them, they're yours.

37:27.435 --> 37:29.396
What the fuck do I want them for?

37:29.913 --> 37:31.726
Ashes have many uses.

37:31.802 --> 37:33.635
All kinds of things you can do with people.

37:33.860 --> 37:36.139
Don't try to play creepy death guy with me.

37:36.199 --> 37:37.962
I see death all the time.

37:38.028 --> 37:39.877
Well, you may see death all the time, sweetheart,

37:39.923 --> 37:42.247
but you obviously don't know what to do with it.

37:42.472 --> 37:44.346
And this one's yours.

37:46.082 --> 37:47.720
All right. Fine.

37:51.689 --> 37:54.448
Not very heavy for a whole dead guy.

37:54.514 --> 37:55.712
Ashes to ashes.

37:55.983 --> 37:57.966
But you know all about that, don't you?

37:59.153 --> 38:01.529
- You have no idea.
- Mm.

38:07.966 --> 38:11.538
- Okay, so tell me the rules.
- Yeah, me too.

38:11.601 --> 38:13.383
We'll just go around the circle until you get it,

38:13.434 --> 38:14.472
then you can join in.

38:14.534 --> 38:15.784
Don't embarrass me.

38:16.173 --> 38:18.225
Tabitha... go.

38:19.147 --> 38:20.375
Overdose.

38:20.499 --> 38:22.880
- Of what?
- Aspirin.

38:22.952 --> 38:24.057
Boring.

38:24.329 --> 38:25.517
Okay, wait.

38:26.004 --> 38:27.574
Boiling oil.

38:27.661 --> 38:29.320
Boiling acid.

38:30.591 --> 38:31.942
Electrocution.

38:32.045 --> 38:33.243
Decapitation.

38:33.392 --> 38:34.595
Flaying.

38:35.101 --> 38:36.515
Brain embolism.

38:37.063 --> 38:38.599
Carpal tunnel.

38:38.777 --> 38:42.013
- What's that?
- It's really, really bad.

38:42.992 --> 38:45.296
Okay. Mrs. Lass?

38:46.898 --> 38:50.369
Um, well...

38:54.001 --> 39:00.455
in my sleep, age 98, surrounded by flowers...

39:00.906 --> 39:02.427
and grandchildren...

39:03.169 --> 39:05.289
and all the people I love.

39:05.428 --> 39:07.481
Jesus, mom, that's not how you play the game.

39:07.571 --> 39:08.735
Well, that's my answer.

39:09.124 --> 39:10.323
That's okay, Reggie.

39:10.450 --> 39:11.223
You go.

39:12.527 --> 39:13.896
Okay...

39:14.541 --> 39:15.760
I'm killed...

39:16.913 --> 39:21.566
by a toilet seat that falls from a space station,

39:22.047 --> 39:23.681
and I'm blown to bits.

39:25.319 --> 39:26.326
Wow.

39:27.653 --> 39:29.641
Okay, party's over. Time to go.

39:31.090 --> 39:32.784
But my mom can't pick me up until later.

39:32.825 --> 39:34.173
Too bad. I said it's time to go.

39:34.243 --> 39:34.821
Mom.

39:34.883 --> 39:36.660
Come on, girls. Let's call your parents.

39:36.731 --> 39:39.050
Mrs. Lass, I totally think you're overreacting.

39:39.199 --> 39:43.020
Sandy, I think you need to go upstairs and get your things and go home,

39:43.096 --> 39:46.326
and put some cold cream on your face, and follow it up with some astringent.

39:46.402 --> 39:48.759
'Cause that pancake makeup is going to destroy your skin.

39:48.836 --> 39:50.550
You don't want to get acne scars.

39:50.996 --> 39:52.312
So mean!

39:56.676 --> 39:57.682
Thanks a lot.

39:57.764 --> 39:59.941
Your sister's death is not a game.

40:00.597 --> 40:01.472
Whatever.

40:01.784 --> 40:05.065
I'm sorry, Reggie, but I'm not comfortable--

40:15.838 --> 40:16.615
Who's that?

40:16.683 --> 40:18.983
Say hello to Arthur Simms.

40:19.089 --> 40:21.016
- He's had quite a day.
- Yeah.

40:21.891 --> 40:22.812
Hey, Kiff.

40:23.048 --> 40:24.543
- Coffee?
- No, I'm good.

40:24.911 --> 40:28.353
- Is that someone's ashes?
- No. No way.

40:29.109 --> 40:31.198
Don't put someone's ashes on my table.

40:31.430 --> 40:32.690
It's bad luck.

40:35.725 --> 40:38.049
He woke up this morning life-size...

40:38.147 --> 40:39.355
now look at him.

40:39.569 --> 40:41.786
No headstone. No nothing.

40:42.027 --> 40:45.315
You don't need a headstone if nobody's going to come to see it.

40:48.417 --> 40:50.864
- Are those ashes?
- Yes.

40:51.643 --> 40:52.821
I was cremated, you know.

40:52.898 --> 40:55.309
- You burned to death.
- That's what I just said.

40:55.365 --> 40:58.789
Gone with the wind... on gone with the wind.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.395
I didn't find that funny.

41:03.404 --> 41:04.480
I did.

41:04.581 --> 41:05.959
How'd your big day go?

41:06.507 --> 41:07.715
Perfect.

41:08.129 --> 41:10.890
I nailed every scene.

41:11.038 --> 41:11.678
Really?

41:11.760 --> 41:13.260
Apparently, I'm a very gifted actress.

41:13.685 --> 41:14.520
Really?

41:15.273 --> 41:17.110
Ask Mason. He was there.

41:17.818 --> 41:19.886
- What's that?
- Arthur Simms.

41:20.767 --> 41:21.634
Who's that?

41:21.709 --> 41:22.886
Uncle Arthur.

41:22.973 --> 41:27.484
Uncle Arthur! You've lost weight. Cheers. Cheers.

41:27.642 --> 41:28.477
Cheers.

41:29.029 --> 41:32.671
So, Mason, was Daisy a good actress?

41:34.200 --> 41:35.737
Yes, she is.

41:35.818 --> 41:36.485
Thank you.

41:36.546 --> 41:38.097
Always has been, it turns out.

41:38.139 --> 41:40.345
My eyes have been opened.

41:40.401 --> 41:43.704
My ears have heard that which they thought they never would.

41:43.817 --> 41:45.041
All right, Mason.

41:45.757 --> 41:47.441
Well, little miss movie star,

41:47.509 --> 41:50.643
we finally got someone that's somebody.

41:50.733 --> 41:52.286
Mm. Yes, I am.

41:52.429 --> 41:55.256
And that somebody should pick up the check.

41:56.766 --> 41:58.153
Uh, Roxy?

41:58.686 --> 42:01.133
Can you do me one more big favor?

42:01.189 --> 42:03.166
I'm not going anywhere with that dead man.

42:03.264 --> 42:04.881
It's a health code violation.

42:05.209 --> 42:07.580
Circle of life, right?

42:07.635 --> 42:10.395
Okay, but you have to go on my shift with me.

42:10.732 --> 42:13.257
- And he seats on the back seat.
- That's fine.

42:15.424 --> 42:17.641
- Congratulations, Daisy.
- Thank you.

42:27.921 --> 42:29.001
You keep doing that, you know.

42:29.047 --> 42:31.085
- What?
- Fixing your face.

42:31.172 --> 42:32.995
A girl's got to look good for her man.

42:33.066 --> 42:37.572
That man grabbed you by the arm, Daisy.

42:39.732 --> 42:41.605
I don't think I care for him much.

42:41.715 --> 42:44.469
What you don't care for is that he's dating me.

42:45.303 --> 42:48.731
I'd really appreciate it if you'd be civilized

42:48.975 --> 42:50.225
when he shows up.

42:50.648 --> 42:51.597
He's coming here?

42:51.652 --> 42:52.892
Yep. Of course.

42:53.506 --> 42:54.909
Rube wouldn't like that.

42:55.067 --> 42:58.928
You're right. Rube wouldn't like that, but he's not here, and you still are.

43:01.012 --> 43:02.605
You're so beautiful.

43:04.342 --> 43:05.881
And I love you.

43:08.704 --> 43:11.180
I just don't like you anymore.

43:23.229 --> 43:26.474
In a lifetime, we get to be many things.

43:26.540 --> 43:30.032
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief...

43:30.422 --> 43:33.519
doctor, lawyer, indian chief.

43:34.107 --> 43:39.248
Daughter, sister, scout, college dropout, friend,

43:40.196 --> 43:41.379
dead girl...

43:44.158 --> 43:48.940
Or maybe we just play the parts for a couple of hours until the curtain falls.

43:55.730 --> 43:57.491
From the moment I met him,

43:57.537 --> 44:00.563
I knew something about Arthur Simms was familiar.

44:01.628 --> 44:04.070
I understood wanting to disappear.

44:04.736 --> 44:06.728
I wanted to my whole life.

44:07.792 --> 44:09.072
And then I did.

44:09.729 --> 44:11.980
Okay, Arthur Simms, here you go.

44:12.217 --> 44:14.884
You lived, and then you died.

44:15.432 --> 44:17.285
You have not been forgotten.

44:31.714 --> 44:34.229
I could use some breakfast. You hungry?

44:34.687 --> 44:36.117
I could eat.

44:36.956 --> 44:38.784
Feels like an oatmeal morning.

44:41.992 --> 44:44.698
Maybe I'll try something different today.

44:45.702 --> 44:46.781
You should.

44:47.165 --> 44:48.375
It's a big menu.

44:49.061 --> 44:50.003
Hmm...

44:51.264 --> 44:55.023
