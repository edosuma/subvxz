00:09.458 --> 00:12.416
DAPHNE: Well, I'm off to get
our lunch. Any special requests?

00:12.578 --> 00:16.537
- No, anything you pick up will be fine.
- Okay, then. Back in a bit.

00:16.698 --> 00:17.847
She is such a doll.

00:18.058 --> 00:20.049
You are such a doll.

00:21.698 --> 00:24.451
- I thought she'd never leave.
- I know.

00:24.658 --> 00:28.412
- It's nice to have time alone finally.
- Come here, you.

00:32.298 --> 00:34.016
Hey, you, get your own!

00:34.218 --> 00:35.810
No, go on.
Now, get away. Come on.

00:36.018 --> 00:39.090
- Hey, come with me. Come on, Eddie.
- Go on. Go on.

00:39.258 --> 00:40.691
MARTIN:
There you go.

00:40.858 --> 00:43.326
Seat's already up for you.
It's happy hour.

00:43.498 --> 00:44.897
Bye.

00:45.298 --> 00:50.167
- Now, where were we?
- Oh, come here, you little devil, you.

00:50.778 --> 00:52.211
DAPHNE:
Look who was just coming home

00:52.378 --> 00:53.731
with take-out
from the gourmet shop.

00:53.898 --> 00:55.854
- Oh, isn't that lucky?
SHERRY: Hey, boys.

00:56.018 --> 00:59.977
My, don't you look handsome
in your best bib and tucker.

01:00.138 --> 01:03.653
Come on and give Aunt Sherry
a great big kiss.

01:03.858 --> 01:07.089
Or perhaps just a friendly wave
from across the room.

01:07.258 --> 01:09.055
Niles, you are so shy.

01:09.218 --> 01:12.608
Thank God your big brother isn't.
Come on, Fras, plant one on me.

01:14.778 --> 01:16.336
There you are.

01:18.138 --> 01:19.776
Has Eddie been licking you?

01:20.858 --> 01:23.088
- Yes.
- Yes, I thought your perfume had

01:23.258 --> 01:25.408
a hint of Snausage in it.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.729
SHERRY:
So you two have been shopping.

01:28.898 --> 01:30.536
Well, "antique-ing" actually.

01:30.698 --> 01:33.815
I just found the most exquisite
Japanese doorknocker.

01:34.018 --> 01:37.727
It's said to bring peace and tranquillity
to any home it adorns.

01:37.938 --> 01:40.054
I haven't seen any decent
Oriental knockers

01:40.218 --> 01:42.174
<i>since Empress Chow's
Shanghai Revue.</i>

01:45.698 --> 01:49.373
Isn't she great?
She's as funny as she is classy.

01:49.578 --> 01:50.977
No argument there.

01:52.898 --> 01:55.696
Oh, by the way, if you want someone
to install that for you,

01:55.898 --> 01:58.014
I can put you in touch
with my ex-houseman, Ghi.

01:58.218 --> 02:00.095
- Ghi?
- No, Ghi.

02:00.298 --> 02:02.334
- Ghi?
- No, no. Back of the throat. Ghi.

02:02.538 --> 02:04.654
Oh, what's the difference?

02:04.818 --> 02:08.697
I'm not so helpless that I cannot install
a simple doorknocker on my own.

02:14.178 --> 02:15.850
You might want to use the screwdriver.

02:16.538 --> 02:18.335
That's exactly what I was about to get.

02:21.938 --> 02:23.610
It's in the tool drawer.

02:27.178 --> 02:29.055
The drawer under
that big tea server thing.

02:29.218 --> 02:31.971
Dad, that is a Byelorussian samovar.

02:32.178 --> 02:33.736
By God, how long have you lived here?

02:34.818 --> 02:36.376
Here we are. Lunch is ready.

02:36.538 --> 02:40.451
Actually, I just remembered, I've got an
errand I gotta run before I get to work.

02:40.658 --> 02:43.855
Goodbye, Niles. Don't worry,
I'm not gonna kiss you.

02:44.018 --> 02:46.088
I know it embarrasses you.

02:46.258 --> 02:48.055
Wait, come here.

02:48.218 --> 02:50.049
You got some schmutz on your cheek.

02:51.858 --> 02:54.008
My mistake, it's a mole.

02:54.738 --> 02:56.808
You might wanna have that checked.

02:57.018 --> 03:00.772
Oh, I think now I'll just play it safe
and have it removed.

03:02.658 --> 03:05.934
Oh, Daphne, apparently this morning
when you were dusting, you forgot...

03:06.138 --> 03:09.448
<i>This objet does not face front,
but rather, askew.</i>

03:09.658 --> 03:11.808
Oh, I'm so sorry, Dr Crane.

03:11.978 --> 03:16.415
I should never have tried to do it
without that diagram you drew me.

03:16.618 --> 03:18.609
Frasier,
now that I know you like antiques,

03:18.778 --> 03:20.769
I've got a little present at home
for you.

03:21.378 --> 03:23.846
It's a lamp shaped like
two frogs kissing.

03:24.018 --> 03:26.373
And when you turn it on,
their hearts glow.

03:28.058 --> 03:30.014
When would you like me to bring it by?

03:30.218 --> 03:31.890
Preferably when I'm here.

03:33.658 --> 03:36.934
I'll bring it with me tomorrow. Bye-bye.

03:37.138 --> 03:39.015
Daphne, would you bring me
that hammer?

03:39.218 --> 03:41.174
I thought you just needed
a screwdriver.

03:41.338 --> 03:44.410
Well, I do. I just wanna be prepared
when that froggy lamp gets here.

03:46.578 --> 03:49.456
- See you later, honey. I'll call you.
- Okay, bye.

03:49.658 --> 03:51.808
- Oh, hi there, Mrs Langer.
- Ms.

03:52.018 --> 03:53.576
Oh, right, Mis...

03:53.778 --> 03:55.609
...erable old cow.

03:59.218 --> 04:02.449
- Tonight's your opera night, isn't it?
- Yes. Why?

04:02.658 --> 04:06.207
Well, I was wondering. I'd love to cook
a nice romantic dinner for Sherry,

04:06.418 --> 04:09.171
but I can't do it at her place
because I'm allergic to her cats,

04:09.338 --> 04:11.135
and there's just no privacy
around here.

04:11.298 --> 04:14.176
Say no more, Dad.
My bachelor pad is the perfect place

04:14.338 --> 04:17.011
to entertain a young lady.
Just remember:

04:17.178 --> 04:20.011
Always use coasters,
no snacking in the carpeted areas,

04:20.178 --> 04:24.091
and close the art books after viewing
so you don't crease the spine.

04:25.458 --> 04:28.211
I believe they have the same rules
at the Playboy Mansion.

04:29.698 --> 04:31.131
Well, there we are.

04:31.298 --> 04:33.209
That's that, huh? That's not so hard.

04:33.378 --> 04:36.575
Tomorrow, I may just have to tackle
that leaky sink in the powder room.

04:40.098 --> 04:42.566
Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought that was a joke.

04:43.898 --> 04:45.126
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

04:46.098 --> 04:47.770
The inaugural knock.

04:50.738 --> 04:53.047
Oh, what's this?

04:56.378 --> 04:58.812
"Your unauthorized doorknocker
violates the condo by-laws

04:58.978 --> 05:00.457
regarding hallway decoration.

05:02.138 --> 05:04.094
Remove it immediately."

05:04.298 --> 05:06.653
That's one of Mrs Langer's
"no-no" slips.

05:06.858 --> 05:08.086
I can't stand that woman.

05:08.298 --> 05:10.175
Just because she's president
of the condo board,

05:10.338 --> 05:11.930
she acts like this
building's her kingdom.

05:12.098 --> 05:14.453
Everything has to be done exactly
the way she likes it.

05:14.658 --> 05:17.775
Yes, well, Daphne, no one hates
a bossy fuss-budget more than I do,

05:17.938 --> 05:20.850
but, Daphne...
Askew, askew! Don't you see?

05:23.378 --> 05:25.892
But rules are there for a reason.

05:26.058 --> 05:29.607
I was obviously at fault for not getting
approval before I hung it up there.

05:29.818 --> 05:31.331
I did notice a sign in the lobby about

05:31.498 --> 05:34.171
some condo board meeting tonight
if you want to present your case.

05:34.338 --> 05:37.216
Perfect. We live in a democratic
system, and I will work within it.

05:37.378 --> 05:39.767
I'm sure I can persuade them
with my charm and eloquence.

05:39.978 --> 05:42.253
I don't know.
Those people can be very difficult.

05:42.418 --> 05:45.012
Pish-tosh. It's not as though
I'll be addressing the Supreme Court.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.134
I'll simply be talking to the board.

05:47.338 --> 05:50.330
Well, they will be by the time
he gets through.

05:53.618 --> 05:58.055
LANGER: After careful consideration
of the bids from a number of gardeners,

05:58.258 --> 06:02.615
we have decided to go
with Jordan Landscaping.

06:02.778 --> 06:04.052
Excuse me.

06:04.218 --> 06:06.937
I'm not too late, am I?
I was hoping to make a statement.

06:07.138 --> 06:09.652
Me too. No, they'll be getting
to new business shortly.

06:09.818 --> 06:13.413
Good, good. I have a matter
of some import to discuss.

06:13.578 --> 06:15.136
Well, then you should go before me.

06:15.338 --> 06:17.010
Oh, thank you. Why are you here?

06:17.218 --> 06:19.413
To ask them to make the ramp
out front less steep

06:19.578 --> 06:21.728
so I don't keep rolling into traffic.

06:23.098 --> 06:24.372
How about you?

06:24.538 --> 06:26.130
Oh, well...

06:26.298 --> 06:28.607
Perhaps you should go first.

06:29.378 --> 06:32.688
LANGER: Is that Frasier Crane
talking while I'm talking?

06:34.058 --> 06:36.208
Well, yes. I'm sorry, Ms Langer.

06:36.378 --> 06:39.415
I was just inquiring as to whether I was
too late to raise some new business.

06:39.578 --> 06:41.648
LANGER:
Well, we were just about to get to that.

06:41.858 --> 06:43.211
Why don't you go ahead?

06:43.418 --> 06:45.056
I'll be quick.

06:45.698 --> 06:48.656
Earlier today, I installed a doorknocker
without your permission.

06:48.818 --> 06:50.854
Now, I'd like to say
in my defence

06:51.058 --> 06:53.288
that my overeagerness
was not out of disrespect

06:53.458 --> 06:56.018
but enthusiasm for an object which,
I'm sure you will agree,

06:56.178 --> 06:57.452
is really quite beautiful.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.086
I understand the rule exists
to prohibit people

07:00.258 --> 07:02.294
from putting eyesores
in public places,

07:02.498 --> 07:05.456
but I ask you, should it apply
to something as beautiful as this?

07:05.658 --> 07:06.647
Here, if you will. Please.

07:06.818 --> 07:10.333
Something, which serves only
to elevate our spirits.

07:10.538 --> 07:13.336
Let's just say that someone passes
by my door, sees the knocker,

07:13.498 --> 07:17.377
and suddenly feels just a little bit
better, without even knowing why.

07:17.578 --> 07:20.490
That same person passes a perfect
stranger and smiles,

07:20.658 --> 07:24.537
who in turn reaches down, picks up,
perhaps, a piece of trash,

07:24.738 --> 07:28.970
plants a garden,
volunteers at a soup kitchen.

07:29.138 --> 07:33.177
Like little ripples on a still pond,
the happiness spreads.

07:33.378 --> 07:38.133
So, what I'm asking you to do is think
of this not simply as an ornament,

07:38.298 --> 07:40.528
but rather an opportunity.

07:40.698 --> 07:46.933
Dare I say it, knocking on a door
of a new, more civilized world.

07:47.098 --> 07:48.736
Thank you.

07:50.138 --> 07:52.732
- Allow us just a moment.
FRASIER: Of course.

07:53.258 --> 07:54.976
Request denied.

07:55.218 --> 07:58.688
You must remove the knocker
within 24 hours,

07:58.858 --> 08:01.816
despite the consequences
to world peace.

08:02.098 --> 08:03.770
Yes, well, I appreciate your...

08:03.938 --> 08:06.930
Are you still talking?

08:07.098 --> 08:10.329
- Your request is denied! Sit down!
- But there's been no discussion.

08:10.498 --> 08:12.170
It hasn't even been opened up
to the floor.

08:12.378 --> 08:14.096
I will entertain suggestions
from the floor

08:14.258 --> 08:16.897
if anyone has any idea how
to shut this man up!

08:17.458 --> 08:20.575
I came down here expecting a fair
hearing in the democratic tradition.

08:20.738 --> 08:22.774
But I see now that you are a tyrant,

08:22.938 --> 08:25.816
concerned more with the exercise
of power than with justice.

08:26.018 --> 08:27.736
Well, fine, I will leave now,

08:27.938 --> 08:30.771
taking solace in the certain knowledge
that, in time, you, Ms Langer,

08:30.938 --> 08:34.374
will join all tyrants on the ash heap
of history!

08:40.938 --> 08:42.769
I'm not here.

08:42.938 --> 08:44.451
Pardon me.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.775
Oh, dear. I'll just get those later.

MAN:
Dr Crane.

09:24.858 --> 09:27.247
- Yes. Who's there?
- A friend.

09:27.458 --> 09:29.335
Keep your distance.

09:29.538 --> 09:32.177
- Well, why can't I see you?
- That's not important right now.

09:32.378 --> 09:35.814
What's important is that you were
not afraid to go up against...

09:35.978 --> 09:37.730
...Ms Langer last night.

09:38.698 --> 09:41.371
- Without much success.
- More than you know.

09:41.538 --> 09:43.813
Most people in the building
are afraid of her.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.974
There is a group of us
who fight her, though,

09:46.138 --> 09:49.210
a small, but determined
band of resisters.

09:50.298 --> 09:53.973
You know the new doormat
by the service elevator?

09:54.178 --> 09:55.896
We did that.

09:56.698 --> 09:58.211
It's very nice.

09:58.538 --> 10:00.893
We would like you to be our candidate

10:01.058 --> 10:03.367
and go up against her
in the upcoming elections.

10:03.578 --> 10:05.455
I'm flattered, but I have a great
many demands...

10:05.618 --> 10:07.768
You are our only chance, Dr Crane.

10:07.978 --> 10:10.128
And she must be defeated.
She is evil.

10:11.098 --> 10:14.932
Nichols, in 1704, was two days late
with his condo fee,

10:15.138 --> 10:17.777
and she lowered the water pressure
in his shower.

10:17.938 --> 10:20.406
Eventually, he died.

10:20.898 --> 10:22.809
From bad water pressure?

10:23.018 --> 10:25.407
No, I think it was a hunting accident.

10:26.698 --> 10:28.893
But he spent his last months
on this earth

10:29.098 --> 10:33.091
unable to get all the conditioner
out of his hair.

10:34.058 --> 10:37.289
Only you possess the charisma
and courage to defeat her.

10:37.498 --> 10:39.329
Well, that may be, but...

10:39.498 --> 10:42.535
I am not asking you
to decide right now.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.772
I just want you to say
you'll think about it.

10:46.098 --> 10:47.531
All right.

10:47.698 --> 10:49.370
But why can't I see who you are?

10:49.578 --> 10:52.456
Because I'm remodelling
my bathroom.

10:56.498 --> 11:00.332
If she found out I was talking to you,
she would never approve my bidet.

11:02.098 --> 11:06.057
Just think of me as "Mr X."

11:14.418 --> 11:19.731
That would work better without
the vanity plates, Dr Dorfman.

11:22.978 --> 11:24.969
NILES: Frasier, wait.
- Oh, hello, Niles.

11:25.138 --> 11:27.447
The most extraordinary thing
happened to me in the garage.

11:27.618 --> 11:31.008
- Excuse me. Is Dad home now?
- Yes, as far as I know.

11:31.218 --> 11:33.607
- Oh, I was afraid of that.
- Why? Is something wrong?

11:33.818 --> 11:36.537
Well, last night I invited Dad
to use my apartment

11:36.698 --> 11:39.690
<i>for a quiet, romantic dinner with Sherry
while I attended La Traviata.</i>

11:40.138 --> 11:42.094
Well, the production
was just dreadful.

11:42.258 --> 11:46.456
In "Ah, fors'e lui" the soprano
couldn't hit the E flat above high C.

11:46.658 --> 11:49.616
So I got so fed up, I stormed out,
drove home, entered my apartment,

11:49.778 --> 11:53.771
and when I saw what Dad and Sherry
were doing there, I hit the note myself.

11:55.418 --> 11:57.613
- You mean they were?
- They were.

11:58.938 --> 12:00.132
What did you do?

12:00.338 --> 12:02.488
Pulled up a chaise longue
and took out my opera glasses.

12:02.658 --> 12:04.376
What do you think I did?

12:04.538 --> 12:06.096
I slammed the door and ran away.

12:06.298 --> 12:08.937
I've never been so embarrassed.
I don't think I can face him now.

12:09.098 --> 12:11.453
You simply have
to diffuse the entire subject...

12:11.618 --> 12:13.688
...with a simple adult conversation.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.849
I don't wanna recreate what happened
to Maris and me

12:16.018 --> 12:18.896
after the cabin incident, when I walked
in on her taking a shower.

12:19.058 --> 12:22.653
Oh, God. Months of avoidance
and awkwardness.

12:23.338 --> 12:24.566
Excuse me.

12:24.738 --> 12:27.889
You saw my Maris completely naked?

12:28.098 --> 12:30.453
Don't fret. It was nothing more
than a fleeting glance

12:30.618 --> 12:32.370
in a very steamy bathroom.

12:32.538 --> 12:36.736
More like glimpsing
a bird sapling through a thick fog.

12:37.498 --> 12:38.977
Life is so unfair.

12:39.138 --> 12:43.450
You get a vision of my Maris,
I get a big eyeful of Dad.

12:44.498 --> 12:47.888
Well, I'd say we hit about the same
level on the "yikes" meter.

12:49.218 --> 12:50.617
Oh, Roz, you're here.

12:50.778 --> 12:53.451
Is that your apology
for making me work on Saturday

12:53.618 --> 12:55.893
- and then getting here late?
- I was detained.

12:57.098 --> 13:00.295
Roz, the most extraordinary thing
happened. I was in the parking garage.

13:00.458 --> 13:03.177
Suddenly, I was blinded
by a set of headlights.

13:03.378 --> 13:05.653
A mysterious man crept from
the shadows

13:05.818 --> 13:10.130
and told me that I should run
for condo board president.

13:10.338 --> 13:12.408
You've been at your wine club,
haven't you?

13:14.018 --> 13:15.576
No. This really happened.

13:16.018 --> 13:17.974
Surely, you're not actually thinking
of running.

13:18.178 --> 13:20.408
You've never held an elected office
in your life.

13:20.578 --> 13:23.046
You're forgetting? I served two terms
back in high school

13:23.218 --> 13:25.857
as Grand Panjandrum
of the Vocabulary Club.

13:27.658 --> 13:30.650
Listen, Frasier,
this job is a nightmare.

13:30.858 --> 13:33.930
Trust me, I know. Like, if somebody
wants a garbage disposal,

13:34.138 --> 13:35.457
they'll bug you day and night.

13:35.618 --> 13:39.497
They'll leave kitchen scraps in your
mailbox until they get what they want.

13:39.698 --> 13:41.097
You've served on a condo board?

13:41.298 --> 13:44.051
No, but I have
a brand-new garbage disposal.

13:46.778 --> 13:48.257
- Hello, all.
FRASIER: Daphne.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.972
- Let me help you with those.
DAPHNE: Oh, thanks.

13:51.138 --> 13:53.049
I've had to lug these things five blocks.

13:53.498 --> 13:56.058
This morning, Mrs Langer gave me
one of those "no-no" slips

13:56.218 --> 13:58.937
for parking in the same vacant space
I've been using for years.

13:59.098 --> 14:01.453
Oh, I'm sorry, Daphne.
I'm afraid this is my fault.

14:01.658 --> 14:03.535
Ms Langer is simply retaliating
against me.

14:03.698 --> 14:09.056
You see, last night, I rather humiliated
her in a dazzling display of rhetoric.

14:09.258 --> 14:11.613
I heard you spilled your briefcase
all over the floor.

14:12.258 --> 14:16.331
This building has a grapevine
Ernest and Julio Gallo would envy!

14:17.058 --> 14:19.447
Well, you know, perhaps I should run
against Ms Langer.

14:19.778 --> 14:22.292
God knows she's ripe
for a good comeuppance.

14:22.498 --> 14:24.773
I know exactly what you mean,
Dr Crane.

14:24.978 --> 14:27.253
I was standing behind her in
the elevator the other day,

14:27.418 --> 14:29.409
looking at the back of her head,
and I thought:

14:29.578 --> 14:31.967
"You know, several stout whacks
with a tire iron

14:32.138 --> 14:34.208
and this building will be
a much happier place."

14:36.378 --> 14:38.687
I'll just get these bags
off to the kitchen.

14:39.458 --> 14:42.336
Frasier, this Langer woman sounds
if she wields considerable power.

14:42.498 --> 14:44.011
What if you run against her
and lose?

14:44.178 --> 14:46.294
I'm with Niles.
Let somebody else do it.

14:46.498 --> 14:48.216
What an appalling expression
of apathy!

14:48.418 --> 14:50.613
What kind of a world would this be
if everyone thought that way?

14:50.818 --> 14:51.933
Everyone does think that way.

14:52.098 --> 14:54.817
And look at the kind
of world it is! Corruption in high places.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.650
An electorate unconcerned
with real issues

14:56.818 --> 14:58.854
because they're too consumed
with their own pleasures.

14:59.058 --> 15:01.856
- Is this eclair spoken for?
- It's mine. Put it back!

15:02.498 --> 15:05.774
Roz, don't you see? For it is
if you're not willing to get involved,

15:05.978 --> 15:09.209
then you have no right to grumble
when things don't go your way.

15:09.738 --> 15:12.969
Look at this. I got two slips for not
taking Eddie on the freight elevator.

15:13.138 --> 15:14.412
It's ridiculous.

15:14.618 --> 15:16.370
Everybody uses the main elevator.

15:16.578 --> 15:19.650
Mrs Tornquist has her dog, Fluffy,
in there all the time.

15:19.858 --> 15:21.211
Well, that's it.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.016
I am running
for condo board president.

15:23.178 --> 15:25.089
A time comes in every man's life
when he must

15:25.258 --> 15:26.691
meet face to face
a challenge,

15:26.898 --> 15:28.729
rather than skitter away
like a coward.

15:28.938 --> 15:31.577
Well, I'm proud of you, son.
That's the way a Crane talks.

15:32.378 --> 15:34.972
Oh, Dad, nice seeing you.
I mean, not...

15:49.498 --> 15:51.011
DAPHNE:
Okay, Eddie. Now.

15:59.418 --> 16:01.488
Good boy, Eddie.
Now, go make dinner.

16:05.698 --> 16:08.849
It's just a little joke Eddie and I
have been working on.

16:10.698 --> 16:13.292
It's too bad. It explained so much.

16:15.778 --> 16:18.576
- What is this, another one?
- Oh, yes.

16:18.738 --> 16:20.615
Seems your father got it last night.

16:20.818 --> 16:23.616
I guess he's just refusing to take Eddie
in the freight elevator.

16:23.778 --> 16:26.008
Of course, all that'll be different
once you're elected.

16:26.178 --> 16:29.011
We don't wanna jinx it. But I must say,
I think my chances are good

16:29.218 --> 16:32.574
after this missive I found
this morning on my windshield.

16:33.258 --> 16:34.611
It's from the resistance.

16:36.338 --> 16:40.126
"Dear Dr Crane. We have polled
the building, the election is yours.

16:40.338 --> 16:43.330
Good work." Signed, "Anonymous."

16:44.178 --> 16:46.328
Wouldn't this be more anonymous
if it didn't say:

16:46.498 --> 16:48.966
"From the desk
of Dr William M. Dorfman"?

16:49.938 --> 16:52.213
Yes. Well, now you see
why they need me.

16:53.858 --> 16:54.847
My comfortable lead aside,

16:55.018 --> 16:57.657
I still wish I had a punchier opening
for the speech I wrote.

16:57.818 --> 17:00.127
Well, I'm running out of time.

17:00.898 --> 17:02.251
Unless...

17:02.658 --> 17:04.329
Yes.

17:04.498 --> 17:06.136
I think Ms Langer
may have given me

17:06.298 --> 17:09.017
the very ammunition I need
for my opening salvo.

17:09.218 --> 17:11.492
We'll just see how the voters feel
about a woman

17:11.657 --> 17:15.173
who tries to persecute a disabled
ex-policeman and his loyal little dog.

17:16.098 --> 17:17.895
It'll be nice to live
where people can hang

17:18.058 --> 17:19.969
whatever they damn well please
on their door.

17:20.178 --> 17:23.807
Of course.
Well, pending my approval.

17:25.498 --> 17:26.896
- Is he gone?
DAPHNE: Yes.

17:27.178 --> 17:29.692
- You're not avoiding him, are you?
- Well, yeah, kind of.

17:29.858 --> 17:33.168
I mean, it's pretty embarrassing about
getting caught last night in that hot tub.

17:33.338 --> 17:34.930
The whole building's
talking about it.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.969
- What happened?
- You haven't heard?

17:37.178 --> 17:38.531
No.

17:38.898 --> 17:42.095
- Well, never mind.
- No, no, no. What?

17:42.258 --> 17:45.295
Well, after dinner last night,
my hip was getting kind of stiff,

17:45.458 --> 17:46.732
so I went down to the hot tub.

17:46.898 --> 17:49.696
You know how it is when you kick
on the jets and your trunks fill up

17:49.858 --> 17:51.974
- like a hot-air balloon.
- No, but go on.

17:52.138 --> 17:54.811
Well, nobody's around,
so I just slipped out of them

17:54.978 --> 17:56.206
and tossed them on the deck.

17:56.378 --> 17:58.687
- You mean, you were...?
- Yeah, just floating free.

17:59.178 --> 18:01.533
So I'm just sitting there,
minding my own business

18:01.738 --> 18:03.490
and letting the bubbles
do their work,

18:03.658 --> 18:05.535
and suddenly,
old lady Langer shows up.

18:05.698 --> 18:08.929
She sees my trunks and writes me
out a "no-no" slip right there and then.

18:09.138 --> 18:12.335
You mean the "no-no" slip was
for being naked in the hot tub?

18:12.538 --> 18:13.607
Yeah.

18:14.458 --> 18:17.655
I told Dr Crane it was because you
took Eddie in the elevator.

18:17.818 --> 18:19.297
Oh, dear. I've got to get down

18:19.458 --> 18:21.449
- to that condo meeting.
- Why?

18:21.618 --> 18:23.336
I don't know what's going on
down there,

18:23.498 --> 18:25.454
but suddenly I have
a very queasy feeling.

18:26.778 --> 18:30.009
Just what Ms Langer said
when she tossed me my trunks.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.736
And so you can vote for me,

18:34.938 --> 18:37.498
a person who has worked
this past year

18:37.658 --> 18:40.968
to keep
this building running smoothly,

18:41.138 --> 18:43.333
or you can turn the building over
to a man

18:43.498 --> 18:46.774
who can scarcely keep
his own family under control.

18:48.298 --> 18:49.856
Thank you.

18:55.578 --> 18:57.409
Fellow condo owners,

18:57.618 --> 19:00.974
I am sorry my opponent has chosen
to be vindictive about my family,

19:01.138 --> 19:03.413
but that is merely characteristic
of her behaviour

19:03.578 --> 19:06.138
during her entire term in office.

19:06.298 --> 19:09.051
How else would one explain this?

19:09.258 --> 19:10.896
This citation my father
received last night

19:11.058 --> 19:13.777
is a perfect example of the pettiness
of which this woman is capable.

19:13.978 --> 19:16.731
We're all aware of your father's
behaviour last night.

19:16.938 --> 19:19.293
I'm surprised you're not
too ashamed to bring it up.

19:19.498 --> 19:21.454
Ashamed? Not at all.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.336
I defend his behaviour!

19:23.538 --> 19:25.847
So he had his little friend out
where he shouldn't be.

19:26.018 --> 19:28.816
So what?
He's been doing it for years.

19:29.858 --> 19:32.167
You approve of his behaviour?

19:32.378 --> 19:34.209
Approve? I applaud it.

19:34.418 --> 19:36.488
Have you no compassion?

19:36.978 --> 19:39.253
My father is getting older.

19:39.418 --> 19:42.216
He hasn't many pleasures left in life.

19:42.898 --> 19:45.366
I can't tell you the hours of joy

19:45.538 --> 19:47.529
that that little guy has brought him.

19:49.498 --> 19:50.726
And not just him.

19:51.178 --> 19:55.490
Who among us can't help but break
into a smile upon seeing the little fella?

19:56.938 --> 19:59.168
Oh, I know, you know,
sometimes it is irksome

19:59.378 --> 20:01.573
when his little Eddie appears
at inopportune moments...

20:01.738 --> 20:03.330
He's named it "Eddie"?

20:03.538 --> 20:05.210
Not exactly a name
that I might have chosen.

20:05.378 --> 20:07.334
I might have gone
with something a bit more,

20:07.498 --> 20:10.296
I don't know, whimsical, like...
Oh, "Puck."

20:11.338 --> 20:12.566
You know, the frolicsome sprite

20:12.738 --> 20:14.535
<i>from Shakespeare's
Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

20:14.698 --> 20:16.370
Oh, don't look so shocked.

20:16.578 --> 20:20.127
Whom does it really harm
if he unleashes Eddie once in a while?

20:20.578 --> 20:22.455
It's not as though he's alone
in such behaviour.

20:22.658 --> 20:25.331
Mrs Tornquist, I've seen you do
the same thing with your Fluffy.

20:26.378 --> 20:30.087
You know, if you ask me, not only is
his behaviour harmless, it's laudable.

20:30.258 --> 20:33.534
Why, you should see the looks
on the faces of the school children

20:33.698 --> 20:35.336
when he takes Eddie out
by the playground.

20:39.458 --> 20:41.449
What, what, what?

20:48.298 --> 20:50.209
On the other hand,

20:51.058 --> 20:52.457
we all need rules.

20:52.618 --> 20:54.051
Go, go, go!

20:57.658 --> 20:59.296
Sorry about the knocker.
