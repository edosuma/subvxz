00:42.824 --> 00:44.826
Here I sit alone and wait...

00:46.328 --> 00:47.829
Surrounded by broken tablets

00:48.330 --> 00:50.832
and new tablets
half-covered with writing.

00:50.832 --> 00:52.834
When will my hour come?

00:54.336 --> 00:56.838
The hour of my going down
and going under,

00:56.838 --> 00:59.541
for I want to go
among men once more.

01:01.043 --> 01:02.544
For I am waiting now...

01:02.544 --> 01:02.544
For I am waiting now...

01:04.046 --> 01:07.049
For first of the signs
that my hour has come.

01:09.051 --> 01:12.554
Meanwhile, I talk to myself
this one last time.

01:14.056 --> 01:17.059
Nobody tells me
anything new.

01:19.061 --> 01:20.562
So I tell myself...

01:22.564 --> 01:23.565
Myself...

01:37.279 --> 01:38.280
You want to see me?

01:38.280 --> 01:40.282
Yeah.
Commissioner gil...

01:41.283 --> 01:42.284
You play chess?

01:42.284 --> 01:44.286
What's going on?

01:44.786 --> 01:47.789
We got the dedication ceremony
in the morning at 10:00 sharp.

01:50.292 --> 01:51.293
I think you'd
better leave.

01:51.293 --> 01:52.294
Relax.

01:53.295 --> 01:55.297
We got just enough time
for a game.

02:06.308 --> 02:08.310
Perez prado...

02:08.310 --> 02:09.811
The original
mambo king.

02:12.314 --> 02:13.315
What?

02:15.817 --> 02:16.818
The music.

02:21.323 --> 02:25.327
I'm not sure I understand
your strategy, Mr. moon.

02:26.828 --> 02:27.829
Redemption.

02:31.333 --> 02:34.336
Redemption...

02:34.336 --> 02:36.838
Separates the wheat
from the shaft.

02:53.355 --> 02:54.356
Checkmate.

02:56.858 --> 02:59.861
And I do understand
redemption.

04:10.232 --> 04:12.734
Outward-bound passage

04:12.734 --> 04:15.237

04:27.148 --> 04:29.651
Outward-bound passage
leaves in one minute.

04:29.651 --> 04:31.152
Last call.

04:31.152 --> 04:33.154

leaves in one minute.

04:33.655 --> 04:35.156
Last call.

04:51.172 --> 04:54.676
Next passage of track 666
in 15 minutes.

04:55.176 --> 04:58.680
Next passage of track 666
in 15 minutes.

05:12.994 --> 05:14.996
Good to see you,
cam.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.502
When I say I don't
want feds, I mean it.

05:20.502 --> 05:21.503
Got the photos?

05:23.004 --> 05:25.006
Walk with me, cam.

05:25.006 --> 05:27.509
Where are you taking me?

05:27.509 --> 05:30.512
Commissioner giltner's
turning state's evidence.

05:30.512 --> 05:33.014
Moon's in trouble with
us and the syndicate.

05:33.014 --> 05:34.015
He's desperate, cam.

05:34.015 --> 05:37.519
He's trying to
clean out the problems.

05:37.519 --> 05:38.520
Clean out?

05:39.020 --> 05:41.523
Everybody who even looks
like a problem, clean.

05:42.023 --> 05:44.526
Lord knows it's
his only chance.

05:44.526 --> 05:46.027
I need those photos

05:46.027 --> 05:47.529
in case moon
gets to giltner.

05:47.529 --> 05:49.030
You want out, cam?

05:53.535 --> 05:55.036
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

05:55.036 --> 05:58.039
Now, that's more evidence
than any D.A. Could ask for.

05:58.039 --> 06:00.041
Don't ask me to testify.

06:00.041 --> 06:01.543
I'm leaving tonight
without the escort.

06:01.543 --> 06:03.545
Negatives?

06:03.545 --> 06:05.046
Stashed.

06:07.549 --> 06:09.551
Hey...Look...

06:09.551 --> 06:11.553
I gave you
what you wanted.

06:13.054 --> 06:15.056
You don't need me!
Just let go!

06:15.056 --> 06:16.558
Oh, shit!

06:17.058 --> 06:18.059
Shut up.

06:18.059 --> 06:19.060
Rat.

06:21.563 --> 06:23.064
I want 15 grand
for those negatives.

06:23.064 --> 06:25.066
Getting cam
wasn't gonna be...

06:25.066 --> 06:26.067
Getting you...

06:26.067 --> 06:28.069
Is what Mr. moon
wants, Jerry.

06:28.069 --> 06:29.070
Aah!

06:31.072 --> 06:31.573
And thank you.

06:32.073 --> 06:33.575
We've already
got the negative.

06:33.575 --> 06:34.576
Ricky.

06:36.077 --> 06:37.178
No!

06:48.289 --> 06:50.792
Purgatory systems
is checking your clearance.

06:51.292 --> 06:51.793
Stand by.

06:53.294 --> 06:54.295
What is this place?

06:54.295 --> 06:56.297
It's one of the syndicate's
construction projects,

06:56.297 --> 06:58.099
a new correctional
facility.

06:58.099 --> 07:00.502
It's a prison, Ricky.

07:00.502 --> 07:03.004
Now, how in the world
would the syndicate

07:03.004 --> 07:05.507
get to build a prison?

07:05.507 --> 07:06.508
Payoff, stupid.

07:07.008 --> 07:10.011
It's opening tomorrow,
ribbon-cutting and everything.

07:10.011 --> 07:12.514
Moon has got
a twisted sense of humor.

07:13.014 --> 07:14.516
Why does he
want us up here?

07:14.516 --> 07:15.517
This is spooky.

07:15.517 --> 07:17.018
Because he's here.

07:17.018 --> 07:19.020
Looks like the workers
cleaned out fast.

07:19.020 --> 07:20.021
What's this
damned thing

07:20.021 --> 07:21.022
all about,
fellas?

07:21.022 --> 07:22.023
Hey, don't do that.
I hate that.

07:22.023 --> 07:23.024
Do what?

07:23.024 --> 07:24.526
Swear when you
don't have to.

07:25.727 --> 07:27.028
What the hell are you
talking about, boy?

07:27.028 --> 07:28.530
Ha ha!

07:28.530 --> 07:30.532
I'll say "hell" whenever
I wanna say "hell," asshole.

07:31.032 --> 07:32.033
You shut up!

07:32.033 --> 07:33.034
Man's trying
to make

07:33.034 --> 07:34.035
a damn cultural
point, right?

07:34.035 --> 07:35.537
Enough!

07:35.537 --> 07:38.540
What are you, my God-almighty
father, all of a sudden?

07:38.540 --> 07:39.541
Are we there yet?

07:39.541 --> 07:42.043
Ok, my space...

07:42.043 --> 07:43.545
Your space.

07:45.046 --> 07:47.048
Look at that, Marcus.

07:47.048 --> 07:50.051
Strange, isn't it?
Us here and now.

07:50.051 --> 07:51.052
Uh-huh.

07:51.052 --> 07:52.554
Why are we all
together on this?

07:54.055 --> 07:55.056
We?

07:55.056 --> 07:57.559
We're together because
we were told to be.

07:57.559 --> 07:59.561
Yeah, yeah.
And moments later,

07:59.561 --> 08:00.962
we'll be picked up
by a damned limo

08:01.062 --> 08:02.564
at the corner of
fifth and Broadway.

08:03.064 --> 08:04.065
So why don't you
crawl up his ass

08:04.065 --> 08:05.567
for saying that, Ricky?

08:05.567 --> 08:06.568
For saying what?

08:08.570 --> 08:10.071
"Damned limo."

08:10.572 --> 08:11.573
Jesus. Are we
back on this?

08:11.573 --> 08:13.575
Direct quote.
Doesn't count.

08:13.575 --> 08:15.577
Is "damn" even
a swear word?

08:15.577 --> 08:17.078
Who cares,
for Christ's sake?

08:17.078 --> 08:20.081
Hey look d, I got a healthy respect
for profanity, ok?

08:20.582 --> 08:22.083
It's just that
they're not happy words,

08:22.083 --> 08:23.585
and it don't make me
happy to hear them.

08:23.585 --> 08:26.087
Use something over and over
and over again, you know,

08:26.087 --> 08:27.589
it ceases
to have any meaning.

08:27.589 --> 08:30.091
Hell, hell, hell, hell.
You know what I mean?

08:30.091 --> 08:31.593
So what do you care
if I use it

08:31.593 --> 08:32.594
if it doesn't
mean anything?

08:33.094 --> 08:34.095
Look, all I'm saying is,

08:34.095 --> 08:35.597
maybe you use them
a little less,

08:35.597 --> 08:36.597
they mean a little more.

08:38.099 --> 08:40.101
Especially
in the movies.

08:40.101 --> 08:42.102
Well, that's why
I use them, Ricky,

08:42.102 --> 08:43.605
because they don't
mean a damn thing.

09:28.249 --> 09:30.251
Purgatory requests
all weapons be checked in

09:30.251 --> 09:32.253
with cerebus
at the portal gateway.

09:34.255 --> 09:36.257
Just take the girl.
The other one's dead.

09:44.766 --> 09:47.468
Hey, Ricky, I'm not
gonna carry that bitch.

09:47.468 --> 09:48.970
I'll get her.

09:51.973 --> 09:52.974
Oh! Uhh!

09:57.579 --> 09:58.580
What the hell is this?

09:58.580 --> 09:59.581
None of our
business, darlin'.

10:04.786 --> 10:05.787
How about
the other one?

10:06.287 --> 10:07.288
Well,
he's not Lazarus,

10:07.789 --> 10:08.789
and Jesus ain't
showin' up today,

10:08.920 --> 10:10.760
so lock it
and leave it, Bob.

10:13.094 --> 10:16.097
You are now in the purgatory
security network.

10:16.598 --> 10:18.099

10:53.034 --> 10:55.036
Let's see
your weapons, boys.

10:55.036 --> 10:56.037
What's up?

10:56.037 --> 10:57.038
What is this?

10:57.538 --> 10:59.540
Mr. moon doesn't want
any heat at the meeting.

11:09.651 --> 11:10.151
Bang.

11:10.652 --> 11:11.152
You're dead.

11:23.765 --> 11:24.766
Well?

11:24.766 --> 11:26.567
It's green eggs and ham.

11:31.572 --> 11:32.473
Let's see
your weapons.

11:33.574 --> 11:36.077
You are now in the purgatory

Oh.

11:55.596 --> 11:57.098
What the fuck is this?

12:00.101 --> 12:01.102
Take it easy.

12:03.104 --> 12:06.107
Never seen you
before, man.

12:06.107 --> 12:07.108
From out of town.

12:12.113 --> 12:15.116
Who are you,
Dr. fuckin' Seuss?

12:15.116 --> 12:16.117
Funny.

12:32.734 --> 12:35.236
Ooh. Check
everywhere, sugar.

12:35.236 --> 12:36.738
You never know
what I'm hiding.

12:41.242 --> 12:43.244
Come on.

12:43.244 --> 12:44.245
Come on.

13:16.077 --> 13:17.578
That's gotta be you.

13:28.089 --> 13:28.589
Get goin'.

13:41.702 --> 13:43.704
Long time, d.

13:43.704 --> 13:44.705
Double "d."

13:46.207 --> 13:48.209
Buttface...

13:48.209 --> 13:49.710
Dickhead.

13:49.710 --> 13:50.711
I'm dickhead.

13:51.212 --> 13:52.713
I'm buttface.

13:52.713 --> 13:54.715
Don't forget.

13:54.715 --> 13:55.716
Anytime.

13:55.716 --> 13:56.717
Anyplace.

13:59.220 --> 14:00.221
She wants us.

14:00.221 --> 14:01.722
Lucifer command

14:01.722 --> 14:03.724

15:25.606 --> 15:27.108
I'm taking care of it.

15:27.108 --> 15:29.911
I'll turn the prison back
over to the city tonight.

15:29.911 --> 15:31.412
It'll be ready.

15:32.413 --> 15:33.414
Hey, moon...

15:33.414 --> 15:35.917
Nothing else
will go wrong.

15:35.917 --> 15:36.918
What the fuck is this?

15:37.418 --> 15:38.419
I know the deal.

15:38.419 --> 15:40.021
What is this?
I don't get it.

15:45.626 --> 15:48.229
Marcus, what's up, stud?
How's the world?

15:48.229 --> 15:50.231
Spinning right along.

15:50.231 --> 15:53.234
Jesus, I told you bring her,
not rip her head off.

15:53.234 --> 15:55.736
She's got a lot of balls
for an accountant.

15:55.736 --> 15:57.238
Yes, she does.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.742
Your boys are
kind of fresh, boss.

16:01.742 --> 16:03.744
I'll make sure to tell 'em.
Come here, slut.

16:07.548 --> 16:09.550
Aw, sweet pea, I didn't
expect you to be here.

16:09.550 --> 16:11.552
This is like
a members only thing.

16:12.053 --> 16:14.055
Big Bob said
it would be ok.

16:14.055 --> 16:14.555
Did he?

16:17.058 --> 16:17.558
Hey!

16:18.059 --> 16:20.561
Best laid plans
of moon and men.

16:20.561 --> 16:22.563
I'm sorry, boss.

16:57.198 --> 17:00.201
Marcus, you keep your head
about you, ok, man?

17:17.518 --> 17:20.521
The original mambo king.

17:20.521 --> 17:22.522
Huh?

17:22.522 --> 17:25.026
Makes you want to dance.

17:26.027 --> 17:27.528
Asshole.

17:34.835 --> 17:38.739
You have all
betrayed the syndicate.

17:38.739 --> 17:41.742
Maybe in little ways
over a long period of time.

17:41.742 --> 17:44.745
Maybe once.
Maybe one big time.

17:44.745 --> 17:46.247
Maybe something in-between.

17:46.247 --> 17:49.950
You blabbed, you stole,
you plotted,

17:49.950 --> 17:53.454
you saw too much,
maybe you did too little.

17:53.454 --> 17:54.955
Now, your individual sins
are written

17:55.456 --> 17:57.958
right on the cards
right in front of you.

17:57.958 --> 18:01.462
But I'm sure you know,
and we all know,

18:01.462 --> 18:03.964
what happens to those
that betray the syndicate.

18:03.964 --> 18:06.967
Our first intention was just
to murder you motherfuckers.

18:06.967 --> 18:08.469
Throw your punk asses
in a big-ass hole,

18:08.969 --> 18:11.972
cover it up with lime.
That'd be the easiest way.

18:11.972 --> 18:14.475
But that ain't
the most interesting, nah.

18:14.475 --> 18:15.976
So I convinced them,

18:15.976 --> 18:18.479
why don't you let me give
out prizes to the winners?

18:18.479 --> 18:19.980
Let the syndicate watch?

18:19.980 --> 18:23.184
This shit's gonna be
better than pay-TV.

18:23.184 --> 18:26.187
So look at all you
tough motherfuckers...

18:26.187 --> 18:29.390
Who is the best killer in here?
I don't know.

18:29.390 --> 18:30.391
Oh, shit.

18:30.391 --> 18:34.095
Best backstabber...
Step up, claim your prize.

18:34.095 --> 18:36.597
Gold, bronze, silver...

18:36.597 --> 18:39.900
To the losers...
Who gives a fuck?

18:39.900 --> 18:41.402
We are gonna find out

18:41.402 --> 18:43.404
who the coldest 3 motherfuckers
in this building are.

18:43.404 --> 18:45.906
Better believe that shit.
What's the prize?

18:46.407 --> 18:51.512
Obviously, loyalty means nothing
to anybody in this room.

18:52.012 --> 18:54.515
The prize
is $10 million cash.

18:54.515 --> 18:57.017
Split 3 ways.

18:57.017 --> 19:01.021
That comes up to
$3.3 million dollars each

19:01.522 --> 19:04.525
for the coldest motherfuckers
in this building.

19:04.525 --> 19:08.529
But every good game has to have
good, tough losers, too.

19:08.529 --> 19:11.532
So, who are the losers?

19:18.739 --> 19:21.242
So, what's the rules?

19:21.242 --> 19:25.246
Just like life...
Survival of the fittest.

19:26.247 --> 19:29.750
To win, you eliminate
the competition.

19:29.750 --> 19:32.453
All competition!

19:32.453 --> 19:34.455
Except 3.

19:34.455 --> 19:37.458
This whole prison has been
vacated and cordoned off.

19:37.458 --> 19:38.959
That's the ballpark.

19:38.959 --> 19:41.962
Elevators and gates
are cut off and locked.

19:42.463 --> 19:44.465
Everything else is open.

19:44.465 --> 19:45.966
Deep inside the ballpark

19:45.966 --> 19:48.469
is a briefcase filled
to the top with cash.

19:48.469 --> 19:49.470
That's the prize.

19:49.470 --> 19:52.973
Now, once everybody
gets spread out,

19:52.973 --> 19:55.476
why don't you killers
give a guy a call?

19:55.476 --> 19:58.479
Let me know what's going on,
who got took out.

19:58.479 --> 20:01.982
That way I'll know
when my game's over.

20:01.982 --> 20:03.484
The number's
on the back of your card

20:03.484 --> 20:04.985
right in front of you.

20:04.985 --> 20:07.988
There's phones
all over this joint.

20:07.988 --> 20:09.990
If any one of you
gets a bright idea

20:10.491 --> 20:11.992
and tries to leave
this ballpark,

20:11.992 --> 20:15.496
you'll be disqualified
permanently.

20:15.496 --> 20:17.498
It's the deadliest game.

20:17.498 --> 20:22.603
The true test of your skills,
whether real or imagined.

20:22.603 --> 20:25.105
No more bragging,
you fucking rats.

20:25.105 --> 20:28.309
Motherfuckers
got to show and prove now.

20:28.809 --> 20:32.513
Let the deadliest survive.
Questions?

20:32.513 --> 20:34.615
What the hell
you talking about, man?

20:41.522 --> 20:43.023
Questions?

20:43.524 --> 20:46.827
Yeah. Is there a predetermined
length for this game?

20:46.827 --> 20:50.331
Good question.
After 6 hours, you all die.

20:50.331 --> 20:53.534
After all, they dedicating
this place tomorrow.

20:53.534 --> 20:55.536
Question?

20:55.536 --> 20:56.937
Yeah. What if we
don't want to play?

20:58.539 --> 21:00.040
Then don't!

21:00.040 --> 21:02.042
Any other questions?

21:04.445 --> 21:06.046
Yes.

21:10.751 --> 21:12.753
Where can I get this cd?

21:14.255 --> 21:16.757
You like prado?

21:16.757 --> 21:20.261
Yes. Makes you
want to dance.

21:22.263 --> 21:23.764
Are there
any other questions?

21:26.767 --> 21:27.768
Good.

21:27.768 --> 21:30.271
All of you are more or less
professionals in here,

21:30.271 --> 21:33.274
so I expect you to act
with some form of dignity.

21:33.274 --> 21:35.776
We're not civilians,

21:35.776 --> 21:38.279
so I know
you understand the world.

21:38.279 --> 21:41.282
Life is not fuckin' perfect.

21:45.586 --> 21:47.087
What's going on?

21:47.087 --> 21:47.988
Shut up!

21:47.988 --> 21:49.690
I'll see you later.

22:04.271 --> 22:05.033
Get out of me

24:14.760 --> 24:15.569
it's going!

24:17.087 --> 24:17.723
It's going!

24:20.266 --> 24:21.070
It's gone!

25:03.314 --> 25:03.817
Get her!

25:21.594 --> 25:22.179
Go! Go!

25:28.696 --> 25:29.449
Come on, punk.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.457
Let's see if I'm really
as bad as I say I am.

26:27.368 --> 26:27.867
D...

26:33.172 --> 26:35.505
Well, that's just
too damn bad, Ricky.

27:01.803 --> 27:03.841
No! No! No!

27:04.482 --> 27:06.176
No! Aah!

27:18.917 --> 27:19.451
Bobby?

27:20.888 --> 27:21.507
Bobby?!

27:23.266 --> 27:23.881
Bobby?!

27:32.191 --> 27:34.272
Whoo!
I'm enjoying this!

27:46.530 --> 27:46.899
Come on, man.

27:55.255 --> 27:57.758
Hey, there
goes the bitch.

27:57.980 --> 27:58.545
Hey, man! Hey, man!

28:04.931 --> 28:07.691
Come on, curly.
That the best you can do?

28:14.835 --> 28:15.132
Oh, fell down!

28:49.377 --> 28:50.321
Let me get the rules
straight.

28:50.850 --> 28:52.358
We kill everybody else
before they kill us,

28:52.326 --> 28:53.241
and we get $10 million dollars?

28:53.473 --> 28:54.267
That's it 10 millions

28:54.518 --> 28:55.557
10 millions simple enough.
Yep.

28:56.005 --> 28:56.643
But it's only...

28:56.986 --> 28:58.353
The last 3 alive
who get the money.

28:58.539 --> 28:59.643
Last three, what if it's only 2?

29:00.198 --> 29:00.821
He wasn't
that specific.

29:01.030 --> 29:01.724
He wasn't
that specific?

29:01.997 --> 29:03.410
Yeah, he wasn't
that specific, he didn't say.

29:03.544 --> 29:03.938
He didn't say.

29:04.258 --> 29:04.516
No.

29:05.126 --> 29:06.268
Hey, Joey,
you up there?

29:07.142 --> 29:07.459
What?

29:09.591 --> 29:09.969
Joey?

29:35.608 --> 29:35.955
Joey!

29:41.440 --> 29:41.687
Aah!

29:59.370 --> 30:01.093
I don't think
this is so damn funny.

30:01.559 --> 30:02.353
Oslo.

30:03.768 --> 30:04.731
You think you scare me?

30:05.713 --> 30:07.270
I would have thrown
that knife by now.

30:07.879 --> 30:09.881
Even when you were good,
you were shit.

30:10.319 --> 30:13.265
Yeah, but I would have
thrown that knife already.

30:13.592 --> 30:14.720
I mean,
why take the chance?

30:15.099 --> 30:16.610
First, I want an answer.

30:17.727 --> 30:18.683
No answers.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.475
Nothing. Zero. Nada.

30:22.352 --> 30:23.359
No way outta here.

30:23.949 --> 30:25.459
No way you can
get off the hook.

30:25.931 --> 30:26.985
Then you're no use to me.

30:29.172 --> 30:31.876
I told you.
Don't hold the knife.

30:32.209 --> 30:33.726
Throw the fucking knife.

30:45.943 --> 30:46.817
Like the old days.

30:47.152 --> 30:48.216
Like the old days.

30:48.774 --> 30:49.320
You be good.

30:49.555 --> 30:50.180
You be bad.

30:50.383 --> 30:51.555
He be uglified.

32:05.398 --> 32:05.757
Get her!

32:17.843 --> 32:18.838
Damn! Don't shoot!

32:19.243 --> 32:20.309
Put the gun down.
She's with me d.

32:22.157 --> 32:22.823
Marcus...

32:22.962 --> 32:23.685
There's room
for all of us.

32:24.828 --> 32:26.117
Come on, lady,
if you wanna live.

32:49.987 --> 32:50.884
Ok, room for 3.

32:51.676 --> 32:52.928
But you better know how
to take care of business

32:53.155 --> 32:54.759
when the time comes,
number-cruncher.

32:55.339 --> 32:56.541
This ain't
the junior league.

32:57.413 --> 32:58.206
I know how
to cover my ass.

33:05.424 --> 33:06.965
You better learn
how to cover mine.

34:36.224 --> 34:38.259
You stinking bitch.

34:39.357 --> 34:40.527
How do we know
we can trust her?

34:41.061 --> 34:41.789
'Cause I say so.

34:43.080 --> 34:43.719
I got shot.

34:44.516 --> 34:45.293
But you got out.

34:46.204 --> 34:46.965
We're not out yet,

34:47.955 --> 34:48.900
and there's a lot
of problems

34:48.940 --> 34:49.726
in here with us.

34:50.550 --> 34:51.839
Why'd they all
just go along with it?

34:52.498 --> 34:54.455
Because when you drop
a pile of guns and bats

34:54.831 --> 34:56.415
into a room of killers
and tell them to go,

34:57.106 --> 34:57.846
they're gonna go.

34:58.656 --> 34:59.919
I'm not
part of this.

35:17.096 --> 35:17.475
Look, lady,

35:18.389 --> 35:19.750
reality is a cold,
hard thing

35:20.034 --> 35:20.571
when it comes up

35:20.824 --> 35:21.579
and bites you
in the ass.

35:21.964 --> 35:23.006
You're telling me.

35:24.411 --> 35:25.546
So what's the plan,
big man?

35:26.212 --> 35:28.073
Check the perimeter
and see how secure it is.

35:46.314 --> 35:47.104
You'll need this.

35:57.371 --> 35:57.602
No!

35:57.987 --> 35:58.714
No! Please!

35:59.137 --> 35:59.438
No!

36:00.382 --> 36:00.879
No! Don't!

36:01.906 --> 36:02.572
No! Wait!

36:49.076 --> 36:50.227
Where's your father,
little bitch?

36:51.045 --> 36:51.379
Lou!

36:54.477 --> 36:55.716
Now we're having fun,
sweetie.

37:04.865 --> 37:05.245
You ok?

37:11.483 --> 37:12.796
Get down, Lucy.

37:27.970 --> 37:29.762
We're really having fun now.

37:46.495 --> 37:47.384
Oh, man.

37:51.580 --> 37:52.882
Take somebody out.
That's right.

37:54.261 --> 37:54.927
Come on. Yeah.

37:55.766 --> 37:56.320
Yeah.

38:15.262 --> 38:15.671
Ok.

38:16.332 --> 38:16.740
Ok.

38:17.451 --> 38:17.810
Ok.

38:18.653 --> 38:19.551
Ok. I got one.

38:22.311 --> 38:23.067
I got one.

38:23.663 --> 38:24.348
It's Lenny.

38:26.552 --> 38:28.299
Whose idea was this
anyway?

38:33.410 --> 38:34.018
What does yours say?

38:34.339 --> 38:35.092
It's not your concern.

38:35.689 --> 38:36.436
What about you,
sweetie?

38:37.309 --> 38:38.509
Been skimming the cream
off the top?

38:40.869 --> 38:41.210
Let's see.

38:42.553 --> 38:43.070
What's that...

38:44.287 --> 38:44.885
A camera?

38:46.361 --> 38:47.317
What the hell
were you doing,

38:47.564 --> 38:48.896
taking pictures
of big man's wife?

39:13.085 --> 39:14.280
Don't get comfortable.

39:32.028 --> 39:33.806
He's getting ready to run,
isn't he?

39:39.088 --> 39:39.874
Maybe I could
get over there,

39:40.088 --> 39:41.620
and I could throw my jacket
over the fence.

40:06.124 --> 40:06.865
Snipers.

40:07.476 --> 40:08.582
So running is out.

40:09.131 --> 40:09.797
He can't.

40:10.781 --> 40:13.574
He is Vincent moon.
He can do what he likes.

40:16.582 --> 40:17.673
Hello, Marcus.

40:22.228 --> 40:23.836
We all do as we like.

40:24.503 --> 40:25.815
I truly hate this man.

40:28.343 --> 40:29.555
I know what
you're thinking.

40:29.702 --> 40:30.465
And you're right.

40:31.094 --> 40:31.806
4 is too many.

40:32.799 --> 40:33.863
Should I make it 3?

40:33.982 --> 40:35.279
Three, three, three?

40:35.638 --> 40:36.914
No. 4 is good, Lou.

40:37.676 --> 40:39.397
Would you like to hear
what it sounds like

40:39.744 --> 40:40.964
to have a bullet
rattle around

40:41.328 --> 40:43.137
inside that thick skull
of yours, d?

40:47.772 --> 40:49.637
Room for 3 at the end
of the game, Lou.

40:49.941 --> 40:50.680
You heard the rules.

40:51.298 --> 40:52.107
Rattle, rattle.

40:52.462 --> 40:53.412
4's good, Lou.

40:54.559 --> 40:55.137
4 is good.

40:56.104 --> 40:56.517
I'll put you down.

40:58.568 --> 41:00.168
You put her down,
and we're down to 2.

41:01.632 --> 41:03.077
I'll give you 5
to put down the gun,

41:03.287 --> 41:04.468
or I'll spray you
all over her.

41:09.524 --> 41:10.523
One.

41:14.164 --> 41:15.495
Countdown to destiny.

41:16.291 --> 41:17.108
You know I would.

41:18.142 --> 41:19.636
I like you, d.
Don't get me wrong.

41:21.072 --> 41:21.575
I just knew

41:21.886 --> 41:23.984
this would be the best way
to get my point across.

41:25.225 --> 41:26.012
You know, me...

41:26.287 --> 41:26.452
2.

41:30.035 --> 41:30.515
Everything's fine.

41:30.874 --> 41:31.465
4 is good.

41:32.740 --> 41:33.550
Please, Marcus.

41:35.760 --> 41:36.252
3.

41:36.417 --> 41:36.972
Marcus.

41:37.777 --> 41:40.551
I want you to know
if I miss, I'm sorry.

41:43.337 --> 41:43.868
4.

41:45.571 --> 41:46.324
4 is good.

41:47.023 --> 41:48.527
4 is good.

41:49.357 --> 41:51.591
Just like my good friend
d is saying here.

41:52.615 --> 41:55.091
Because there can only be
3 in the crow's nest.

41:55.933 --> 41:58.213
But 4's got a better chance
than 3, Marc-o.

41:59.032 --> 41:59.908
But 4 is too many.

42:02.583 --> 42:03.609
That's not a problem,

42:04.347 --> 42:06.149
because
at least one of us

42:06.903 --> 42:08.637
is sure to buy it
along the way.

42:09.013 --> 42:10.817
So we start with 4...

42:11.530 --> 42:12.713
One as ballast
through the game

42:13.912 --> 42:16.063
and if we're the only 4
left at the end,

42:16.691 --> 42:17.093
then...

42:17.839 --> 42:20.071
We'll burn that bridge
when we come to it.

42:22.151 --> 42:23.649
But 4 is better than 3.

42:25.206 --> 42:27.600
And much, much better
than 2.

42:28.669 --> 42:29.073
Sorry.

42:44.703 --> 42:45.633
We're agreed then.

42:49.693 --> 42:50.477
5.

42:50.785 --> 42:51.722
Logic prevails.

42:52.463 --> 42:53.193
Come on.

42:53.652 --> 42:54.919
We're settled,
partner.

42:55.161 --> 42:55.766
Put it up.

43:13.174 --> 43:13.827
Bang!

43:24.964 --> 43:25.966
You're a crazy man.

43:26.920 --> 43:28.381
I knew you'd hold up, d.

43:30.851 --> 43:31.529
You always do.

43:33.849 --> 43:34.835
Don't push me, Lou.

43:35.834 --> 43:36.688
Don't push me.

43:36.904 --> 43:37.832
You always back up.

43:38.555 --> 43:39.264
Why not push?

43:49.558 --> 43:50.686
I'm killing everybody.

43:51.014 --> 43:51.763
I'm killing moon.

43:52.391 --> 43:53.913
I'm killing moon's mama.

43:54.623 --> 43:56.279
I'm killing
any little moons.

43:57.285 --> 43:57.744
I don't care who...

44:08.163 --> 44:09.301
No warning next time,
eh?

44:09.730 --> 44:10.115
Right.

44:13.253 --> 44:14.077
Let's go call in, huh?

44:14.831 --> 44:15.558
Forgot about that.

44:17.161 --> 44:17.529
Moon...

44:18.316 --> 44:19.008
The asshole.

44:20.549 --> 44:21.671
Yeah, the boss gave us
those cards...

44:22.156 --> 44:22.704
Want me to call in?

44:24.132 --> 44:24.798
To keep track.

44:24.975 --> 44:25.617
Keep track,
who killed who.

44:28.119 --> 44:29.555
Good to see you again,
big man.

44:30.943 --> 44:31.672
You know him?

44:32.041 --> 44:32.532
Yeah.

44:33.390 --> 44:35.128
Political job
back in '92.

44:35.586 --> 44:37.959
He knows me.
Who's the squeak?

44:38.494 --> 44:39.585
She's with me.

44:39.920 --> 44:41.918
Ohh.
Isn't it romantic?

44:44.541 --> 44:45.081
Ding!

44:49.329 --> 44:50.630
I don't see where
you fit in here, Lou.

44:50.864 --> 44:52.027
You're not one
of moon's regulars.

44:54.895 --> 44:56.840
Well, I was in town
on another...

44:57.772 --> 44:59.168
Rather more
personal matter.

44:59.747 --> 45:01.798
Heard about this little
party beforehand,

45:02.020 --> 45:03.109
asked moon
if I could pull up

45:03.388 --> 45:05.763
and play along with all you
fine, fine people.

45:06.347 --> 45:07.299
You wanted to be here?

45:08.357 --> 45:10.883
I was absolutely dying
to be here, d.

45:11.118 --> 45:11.920
Stop. Stop!

45:15.001 --> 45:16.050
What are
we gonna do?

45:18.028 --> 45:19.825
I don't feel like dodging
sniper fire

45:20.053 --> 45:22.422
and spending the next 10 years
looking over my shoulder.

45:22.654 --> 45:23.101
D's right.

45:24.266 --> 45:25.455
4's better than 3.

45:26.546 --> 45:27.645
We'll play the game...

45:28.612 --> 45:29.423
And finish it.

45:31.189 --> 45:32.340
Minus one of us.

45:37.514 --> 45:39.386
Right now let's
eliminate the enemy.

45:40.984 --> 45:42.183
What I figure is,

45:43.603 --> 45:45.179
everybody's going
after the milk.

45:46.138 --> 45:48.779
I would. 10 million
of moon's money.

45:49.970 --> 45:51.235
Whoever's
got the cash

45:52.371 --> 45:53.316
has got
the position.

45:54.496 --> 45:57.316
Which is exactly what
everyone else is planning.

45:58.766 --> 45:59.845
What they forget

46:00.636 --> 46:02.919
is that it doesn't matter
who's got the money first.

46:03.626 --> 46:05.825
What matters is who's got
the money last.

46:06.698 --> 46:08.144
Marcus: Let's get on
with shaving the odds.

46:10.418 --> 46:12.455
This is good for you.
I can tell.

46:13.911 --> 46:15.009
Builds your character.

46:17.012 --> 46:17.639
Hey!

46:25.246 --> 46:26.678
Age before beauty.

46:34.974 --> 46:35.595
Joy.

46:57.674 --> 46:59.558
You're happy to see me.
I can tell.

47:01.145 --> 47:02.118
You and I...

47:02.564 --> 47:04.144
We speak the same language.

47:14.263 --> 47:14.859
No.

47:16.234 --> 47:17.734
No, we do not.

47:22.893 --> 47:23.403
What's yours say?

47:25.043 --> 47:26.345
Picture of a moneybag
with wings.

47:26.693 --> 47:27.084
Mine, too.

47:28.412 --> 47:29.272
They caught us
red-handed.

47:29.436 --> 47:29.846
Red-handed.

47:30.701 --> 47:31.454
How do you think
he found out?

47:31.644 --> 47:32.892
He found out.
It doesn't matter now.

47:33.993 --> 47:34.632
No, not one iota.

47:35.215 --> 47:35.514
Good word, "iota."

47:36.115 --> 47:36.401
Call in?

47:36.980 --> 47:37.531
And see who's dead?

47:38.109 --> 47:39.135
Yeah. Add ours
to the tally.

47:41.150 --> 47:42.681
6, maybe 6.
I don't know.

47:43.237 --> 47:43.982
I got 2
in the warehouse.

47:44.190 --> 47:44.376
I got one.

47:44.885 --> 47:45.258
Polite guy.

47:46.719 --> 47:47.241
Bad hair guy.

47:48.065 --> 47:48.488
6.

47:49.703 --> 47:50.334
Staircase guy.

47:50.490 --> 47:50.850
7.

47:50.850 --> 47:51.304
This guy.

47:51.601 --> 47:51.923
8.

47:52.855 --> 47:53.163
Is that all?

47:53.720 --> 47:54.142
Yup.

47:54.676 --> 47:55.141
No, no.

47:55.299 --> 47:55.570
Yeah.

47:56.017 --> 47:57.812
There was 3
in the warehouse.

47:58.555 --> 48:00.992
Blackie, bad hair guy,
big guy,

48:01.541 --> 48:04.164
uh, staircase guy,
this guy, and, uh...

48:05.942 --> 48:06.420
The screamer.

48:06.641 --> 48:07.454
Screamer. Bingo, 9.

48:09.066 --> 48:09.580
Beautiful.

48:12.453 --> 48:13.045
Rat trap.

48:20.680 --> 48:22.762
I am not an animal.

48:23.202 --> 48:25.595
I am not an animal.

48:37.990 --> 48:39.489
So, we call in.

48:39.972 --> 48:40.893
Moon will have
a fit.

48:41.071 --> 48:42.910
Shit fit when he finds out
how many we tagged.

48:43.100 --> 48:43.795
Let's find a phone.

48:44.111 --> 48:45.260
Let's go.
Ok.

49:29.265 --> 49:31.100
Are we gonna call in
and listen to the messages?

49:32.187 --> 49:33.812
It would be nice to know
who's still out there.

49:34.358 --> 49:35.347
What's the difference?

49:36.076 --> 49:37.221
We have to kill
them all!

49:38.170 --> 49:39.225
Can we do that?

49:39.590 --> 49:40.532
Sure, we can.

49:48.945 --> 49:50.238
Better to keep off
the line for now.

49:50.707 --> 49:52.996
Oh, the element
of surprise.

49:54.690 --> 49:55.652
Shut up, Lou.

50:03.341 --> 50:04.110
What is that?

50:04.669 --> 50:06.624
Valium, Prozac,
and ritalin.

50:06.978 --> 50:08.128
Breakfast
of champions.

50:30.344 --> 50:31.585
So, how'd you get
in the business?

50:32.789 --> 50:34.382
It's the only thing
I ever wanted to do.

50:35.183 --> 50:36.216
And what I didn't know,

50:37.724 --> 50:38.824
your government
taught me.

51:12.544 --> 51:14.007
That was very nasty.

51:15.282 --> 51:16.816
Honey,
don't even try it.

51:29.492 --> 51:30.921
What do we do now, boys?

51:36.636 --> 51:37.251
Hi there.

51:41.175 --> 51:42.209
You idiot.

52:23.806 --> 52:24.799
She's quick.

52:30.155 --> 52:31.262
Thanks, blondie.

52:52.576 --> 52:52.891
Help me.

53:47.741 --> 53:48.838
Help me.

54:19.057 --> 54:20.312
Would you
shut him up?

54:26.227 --> 54:29.066
No. Save your bullets.
Use that.

54:30.197 --> 54:30.931
Beat him to death?

54:37.574 --> 54:38.478
Get away from me, bitch!

54:39.217 --> 54:39.625
Get away!

54:43.369 --> 54:44.217
Get out of here!

54:44.714 --> 54:45.079
Go away!

54:59.744 --> 55:02.437
He's a mad dog
who needs to be put down.

55:03.346 --> 55:05.742
Prozac,
ritalin, valium.

55:06.621 --> 55:07.943
The man is a toilet.

55:23.404 --> 55:25.226
Get away from me bitch!

55:26.219 --> 55:28.141
No, no, no, no, no.

55:33.410 --> 55:35.476
I thought I told you
to shut him up.

55:36.323 --> 55:36.802
I can't.

55:37.879 --> 55:38.625
I just can't.

56:46.974 --> 56:48.142
No, no, no!

57:11.141 --> 57:12.385
I can't.
I can't!

57:16.682 --> 57:17.378
Please stop.

57:22.322 --> 57:24.037
How about
I shut you up?

57:28.055 --> 57:28.985
I can't.

57:31.353 --> 57:32.000
Did he get her?

57:33.809 --> 57:34.974
Just shut up.

57:35.571 --> 57:35.929
Oh, shit!

57:38.301 --> 57:39.527
Shut up.

57:40.512 --> 57:41.479
Shut up!

57:43.236 --> 57:44.535
Shut up.

57:52.128 --> 57:52.951
On the count of 3,

57:53.442 --> 57:54.910
one of you
is gonna be dead.

57:56.751 --> 57:57.558
1...

57:58.500 --> 57:59.097
2...

58:01.061 --> 58:01.699
Marcus!

58:04.894 --> 58:05.392
3.

58:05.557 --> 58:06.279
I can't!

58:12.606 --> 58:13.128
I'm sorry.

58:13.913 --> 58:14.766
I couldn't help it.

58:18.009 --> 58:19.094
Just too much fun.

58:28.573 --> 58:30.316
You do know
how to use this, right?

58:31.730 --> 58:33.308
Little trigger
under the heavy part.

58:34.841 --> 58:36.139
We can do this.

58:38.247 --> 58:39.238
What's wrong with you?

58:39.640 --> 58:40.617
It's them or us.

58:40.780 --> 58:41.617
Ok, that's enough.

58:42.007 --> 58:42.724
No, not ok.

58:43.315 --> 58:45.127
I need to know that
this babe can do it.

58:49.948 --> 58:52.630
You were thinking,
"let's get somebody else

58:52.858 --> 58:53.726
"to take care
of the problem.

58:54.344 --> 58:55.531
I'll be over here
knitting."

58:56.413 --> 58:57.883
You're an old woman,
my friend.

58:58.515 --> 59:01.048
I don't know
whether to screw you

59:02.142 --> 59:02.872
or kill you.

59:03.148 --> 59:03.844
You've made
your point.

59:04.009 --> 59:05.067
She's got to pull
her weight.

59:05.794 --> 59:06.777
I'm not like you guys.

59:08.392 --> 59:09.341
I didn't ask for this.

59:10.047 --> 59:12.720
Pull the weight
or lighten the load.

59:15.019 --> 59:16.011
Like this?

59:16.865 --> 59:18.146
How about
I just lighten you?

59:26.851 --> 59:27.579
Like this.

59:32.178 --> 59:33.927
What are you,
her mother?

59:36.101 --> 59:36.690
God.

59:37.758 --> 59:39.829
Gonna take a lifetime
to win this.

59:40.801 --> 59:41.424
Yeah.

59:44.523 --> 59:45.462
I'm depressed now.

59:45.824 --> 59:47.333
Got an idea how we can
speed things up.

59:47.772 --> 59:49.377
We just have to find
a way out of here.

59:49.580 --> 59:52.002
You can't.
It's a goddamn prison.

59:52.425 --> 59:54.465
Hey, she's got you
there, d.

59:55.872 --> 59:57.106
Well, let's
say once upon a time

59:57.278 --> 59:58.050
there were 3 bears.

59:58.657 --> 01:00:00.802
God, not another story.

01:00:01.011 --> 01:00:02.657
Yeah Marcus,
just spit it out.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:04.614
The bears went out
one day looking for food,

01:00:04.797 --> 01:00:05.495
which was other bears.

01:00:07.379 --> 01:00:08.640
Ah, cannibalistic
bears.

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:11.169
And when these 3 bears
got back to their house,

01:00:11.777 --> 01:00:13.154
they found
little goldilocks

01:00:13.413 --> 01:00:13.911
sleeping in their bed.

01:00:15.004 --> 01:00:16.176
Just before
they could eat her,

01:00:16.676 --> 01:00:18.956
papa bear said,
"no, just wait.

01:00:20.753 --> 01:00:22.162
We're
cannibalistic bears."

01:00:23.101 --> 01:00:24.962
Yes, yes, we are.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.524
I want to be
mama bear.

01:00:28.196 --> 01:00:29.337
3 bears.

01:00:30.147 --> 01:00:32.953
"Ahh," thought the bears.

01:00:33.305 --> 01:00:34.651
"Goldilocks
is tasty to us,

01:00:34.828 --> 01:00:36.353
"so goldilocks is tasty
to other bears.

01:00:36.581 --> 01:00:38.072
"And what we really like
to eat is other bears,

01:00:38.349 --> 01:00:40.065
"so why don't we use
goldilocks as a trap

01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:41.882
for the other bears?"

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:44.861
And all the bears
nodded their heads,

01:00:45.315 --> 01:00:47.103
and they said that
it was good, so they did.

01:00:48.271 --> 01:00:51.716
And goldilocks was a very good
trap for the other bears.

01:00:52.211 --> 01:00:54.735
And the 3 bears went back
to their nice homes that night

01:00:55.508 --> 01:00:57.430
simply stuffed
to the gills with bear.

01:00:58.096 --> 01:00:58.392
Yum yum.

01:00:59.725 --> 01:01:00.291
The end.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:03.572
So who do we use for bait?
Not goldilocks.

01:01:04.071 --> 01:01:04.830
Not who,

01:01:05.277 --> 01:01:05.878
but what.

01:01:06.461 --> 01:01:07.027
Precisely.

01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:08.520
I'm lost.

01:01:08.857 --> 01:01:09.516
Of course you are.

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:10.948
You're stupid.

01:01:12.523 --> 01:01:13.802
You're pushing
the limit, Lou.

01:01:14.449 --> 01:01:16.549
All right, we tell everyone
we found the money

01:01:16.807 --> 01:01:19.463
and invite all the bears
to try and take it from us.

01:01:19.823 --> 01:01:21.469
So how do we set up
the trap?

01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:24.585
There's got to be
a p.A. System around this joint somewhere.

01:01:24.895 --> 01:01:26.225
All we've got to do
is find a guard station.

01:01:26.954 --> 01:01:29.170
Provided we can find
a good spot to do it

01:01:29.742 --> 01:01:31.302
and not get whacked
ourselves.

01:01:31.686 --> 01:01:32.662
Already spotted a place.

01:01:33.255 --> 01:01:34.017
Marcus...

01:01:35.788 --> 01:01:37.822
Why is everybody
saying you're stupid?

01:01:40.149 --> 01:01:41.035
Now...

01:01:43.464 --> 01:01:45.361
You do know
how to use that, right?

01:01:46.189 --> 01:01:48.315
I mean, squeeze
your finger and all?

01:01:48.892 --> 01:01:50.579
We've already been
through this, Lou.

01:01:50.776 --> 01:01:52.491
Not to my satisfaction.

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:53.597
So she's goldilocks?

01:01:55.579 --> 01:01:57.568
And you are an idiot.
So what?

01:01:57.955 --> 01:02:00.074
I've had just about
enough of you, Lou.

01:02:03.174 --> 01:02:04.710
Don't even joke
about it, d.

01:02:05.535 --> 01:02:08.481
Anytime,amiga,
anytime.

01:02:09.747 --> 01:02:11.148
You're a player in this.
No choice.

01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:13.144
The sooner
we get it over with,

01:02:13.302 --> 01:02:14.589
the sooner we can
go back to our lives

01:02:14.728 --> 01:02:15.746
or go back
to killing each other.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.530
Right now we've got a lot
of problems to take care of.

01:02:19.256 --> 01:02:21.241
You'll stick with this bunch,
or I'll end it now.

01:02:21.487 --> 01:02:22.516
All but one of us
gets out, isn't it right.

01:02:23.653 --> 01:02:24.595
That's moon's rules.

01:02:26.389 --> 01:02:28.446
And rules are made
to be broken.

01:02:29.539 --> 01:02:30.440
At least some are.

01:02:31.408 --> 01:02:32.358
Let's go.

01:02:39.326 --> 01:02:42.059
Ho, man.
Getting hungry.

01:02:42.189 --> 01:02:42.931
For competition.

01:02:43.899 --> 01:02:45.658
Yeah. What should we do?

01:02:47.466 --> 01:02:48.114
Meat loaf.

01:02:55.147 --> 01:02:55.843
Kitchen.

01:02:56.351 --> 01:02:56.762
Food.

01:02:57.352 --> 01:02:59.493
What have you guys
got up your sleeves?

01:03:16.664 --> 01:03:19.070
Oh, that's twisted.

01:03:19.936 --> 01:03:21.183
Twisted, but fun.

01:03:27.112 --> 01:03:27.839
Ah, yes.

01:04:09.071 --> 01:04:10.322
Mmm, popsicle.

01:04:13.412 --> 01:04:15.869
Whoa, hello, Betty.

01:04:17.361 --> 01:04:19.425
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:04:19.969 --> 01:04:22.520
Oh, my God! They're dead!
They're dead!

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:25.123
You saved my life!
Thank you!

01:04:25.764 --> 01:04:27.039
Thank you!
They were hunting me!

01:04:29.214 --> 01:04:30.171
You saved my life.

01:04:33.551 --> 01:04:34.552
You...

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:35.202
You don't
understand.

01:04:36.211 --> 01:04:37.496
Whoa! Let me
get out of the way!

01:04:38.142 --> 01:04:40.315
If you had the chance, you would
have killed us dead as dickens.

01:04:40.655 --> 01:04:42.686
I don't belong here!
I don't belong here!

01:04:42.844 --> 01:04:43.448
I was with a friend!

01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:45.774
Yeah with a friend huh? She's cute.
Can we keep her?

01:04:46.465 --> 01:04:47.721
Neither one of us
can afford to go soft

01:04:48.306 --> 01:04:49.258
for a nice pair of tits.
Not today.

01:04:49.868 --> 01:04:51.756
I won't be any trouble.
I won't, you guys.

01:04:52.413 --> 01:04:54.504
I can help.
I'll be a decoy.

01:04:55.469 --> 01:04:56.880
I'll do anything
you want.

01:04:58.064 --> 01:04:58.730
She's your pet.

01:04:59.714 --> 01:05:01.480
You feed it, you clean it,
you kill it.

01:05:01.665 --> 01:05:03.789
Hey, I really
appreciate this I really do.

01:05:04.048 --> 01:05:05.417
A hundred percent.
You can count on me.

01:05:07.196 --> 01:05:07.774
Can I have a gun?

01:05:11.857 --> 01:05:13.027
Get this straight,
nipples.

01:05:14.527 --> 01:05:16.337
This ain't the girl scouts
or Melrose place.

01:05:17.014 --> 01:05:18.947
Cute doesn't cut it all
the way to the tree line.

01:05:20.431 --> 01:05:22.325
You do what we say
when we say it

01:05:22.478 --> 01:05:23.667
and maybe make it
out of here alive.

01:05:24.014 --> 01:05:25.058
Get in our way
or cross us,

01:05:25.417 --> 01:05:26.606
we'll put you down.

01:05:27.437 --> 01:05:28.627
You're built like
there's no tomorrow,

01:05:29.049 --> 01:05:30.211
but I'll put you
down just the same.

01:05:31.173 --> 01:05:33.253
If you think for one minute
we trust you,

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:34.527
you better think
a little harder.

01:05:35.112 --> 01:05:37.496
This is no time for
slutty games, get me?

01:05:37.865 --> 01:05:38.682
Yes, sir.

01:05:39.137 --> 01:05:40.534
All right, I'm sick of this.

01:05:41.075 --> 01:05:42.361
I'm calling you guys out.

01:05:43.348 --> 01:05:46.271
I'm taking all comers
in 15 minutes

01:05:46.518 --> 01:05:48.195
back in the place
where this all started,

01:05:48.759 --> 01:05:51.360
and I will personally
put holes in all of you.

01:05:52.528 --> 01:05:55.029
Anyone who wants a face-off,
bring it on.

01:05:55.722 --> 01:05:58.399
And by the way,
I found the 10 million,

01:05:58.617 --> 01:06:00.899
but I don't figure moon's
gonna let me leave with it

01:06:01.252 --> 01:06:02.671
unless
you're all taken out.

01:06:03.208 --> 01:06:05.659
Goody. Prime time.
Let's go.

01:06:33.292 --> 01:06:34.039
Everyone's
gonna be there.

01:06:34.631 --> 01:06:36.052
Easiest way
to clean up this mess.

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:37.274
Should have thought
of it, hoss.

01:06:37.321 --> 01:06:37.818
Hoss?

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:39.588
Need some
more bullets.

01:06:39.797 --> 01:06:40.314
A lot more.

01:06:41.715 --> 01:06:42.386
Your name's hoss?

01:06:43.215 --> 01:06:44.882
Hoss. Hoss and crow.

01:06:45.804 --> 01:06:46.915
Ever read
Sam Shepard?

01:06:47.137 --> 01:06:48.577
Tooth of crime?
Fantastic stuff.

01:06:49.533 --> 01:06:50.068
And who are you?

01:06:50.783 --> 01:06:51.448
Barbie.

01:06:52.189 --> 01:06:52.798
Like the doll?

01:06:53.208 --> 01:06:54.097
Like bonanza?

01:06:54.137 --> 01:06:56.848
I'm crow, this is hoss, you're Barbie.
Can we go now?

01:07:04.407 --> 01:07:05.369
Nice bottom.

01:07:05.553 --> 01:07:06.120
Tight bottom.

01:07:07.121 --> 01:07:07.819
About the money...

01:07:09.506 --> 01:07:11.820
I was just wondering
if they even have it,

01:07:11.997 --> 01:07:12.688
or is it just a trick?

01:07:13.493 --> 01:07:14.071
Beg pardon?

01:07:14.748 --> 01:07:16.445
Well, the money's the whole
point of this thing, right?

01:07:24.726 --> 01:07:25.803
I don't think she gets it.

01:07:26.708 --> 01:07:27.796
Barbie.
Barbie.

01:07:30.215 --> 01:07:30.850
Look, honey...

01:07:31.564 --> 01:07:32.544
The money doesn't matter.

01:07:33.285 --> 01:07:35.936
The 3 that walk out of here
are gonna the 3 with the money.

01:07:36.503 --> 01:07:38.086
You're putting the cart
before the horse.

01:07:38.525 --> 01:07:39.277
What if it's a trap?

01:07:39.731 --> 01:07:41.008
Of course
it's a trap.

01:07:41.082 --> 01:07:42.367
We kill people.
We're killers.

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:44.723
We set traps for a living.
Of course it's a trap.

01:07:45.743 --> 01:07:46.850
Do you think
it's smart?

01:07:47.071 --> 01:07:49.286
I don't remember asking
your opinion, pissflaps.

01:07:49.963 --> 01:07:50.404
Need a gun.

01:07:51.994 --> 01:07:54.436
Got one...
Got 2...Got 3.

01:07:54.602 --> 01:07:55.049
Meant her.

01:07:55.997 --> 01:07:57.733
Eighty-six
that idea right now.

01:07:59.776 --> 01:08:00.198
You lead.

01:08:02.456 --> 01:08:03.879
I do.
You do what?

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:04.898
I do need a gun.

01:08:05.484 --> 01:08:07.335
If somebody takes a crack
at me, I'm toast.

01:08:07.677 --> 01:08:08.875
How I can help you?

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:09.968
How can you hurt us?

01:08:10.134 --> 01:08:10.711
Bro, huh?

01:08:11.215 --> 01:08:12.301
I think
I've been clear.

01:08:12.653 --> 01:08:14.090
I do need a gun.

01:08:14.681 --> 01:08:15.905
They're gonna
blow my brains out.

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:19.300
Then keep your head down
until you grow one.

01:08:19.741 --> 01:08:21.095
Let's move. Come on.

01:08:26.638 --> 01:08:27.591
What if they don't come?

01:08:28.788 --> 01:08:29.746
They know it's a trap

01:08:30.871 --> 01:08:32.501
then we'll just have
to kill each other.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.546
This is warped.

01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:41.136
Warped? Watch mtv.
That's warped, man.

01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.214
What's the world coming to?

01:08:48.594 --> 01:08:49.872
How many flies and maggots

01:08:50.069 --> 01:08:51.880
can you work into
the shot here?

01:08:55.444 --> 01:08:57.761
You got lesbian
leather dykes on one hand,

01:08:59.249 --> 01:09:01.557
piss and b.M. In somebody's
mouth on the other.

01:09:04.138 --> 01:09:07.270
It's oglethorpe's playground
to a madness.

01:09:07.966 --> 01:09:09.500
And you'd know
all about that.

01:09:10.046 --> 01:09:10.907
What was that, d?

01:09:12.301 --> 01:09:12.783
Forget it.

01:09:13.453 --> 01:09:14.995
I didn't catch
your remark, d.

01:09:15.178 --> 01:09:15.640
You said it.

01:09:16.953 --> 01:09:18.319
Must want somebody
to hear it.

01:09:18.862 --> 01:09:19.551
I said...

01:09:23.388 --> 01:09:23.928
Nothing.

01:09:24.256 --> 01:09:26.270
Like always...Hot air.

01:09:27.205 --> 01:09:29.139
All talk, no walk.

01:09:29.812 --> 01:09:31.354
You're gonna
buy it today, Lou.

01:09:32.648 --> 01:09:34.176
I just got a feeling
about it.

01:09:35.787 --> 01:09:37.457
We're all gonna
buy it today, d.

01:09:38.158 --> 01:09:39.537
Haven't you
figured it out yet?

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:40.750
Shut up.

01:09:41.165 --> 01:09:42.384
Everyone, chill out.

01:10:17.035 --> 01:10:18.964
This rabbi and this priest,
they walk into a bar...

01:10:19.448 --> 01:10:20.077
A rabbi?

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:23.433
Hey, d, rattle, rattle.

01:10:28.417 --> 01:10:29.579
I swear to Christ, Lou,

01:10:31.046 --> 01:10:31.905
if you don't shut up...

01:10:32.358 --> 01:10:35.063
Waah-freaking-waah.
Boo-freaking-hoo.

01:10:39.547 --> 01:10:40.145
Dammit.

01:10:47.659 --> 01:10:48.664
I didn't mean to you.

01:10:52.875 --> 01:10:55.227
I think I'm going to have
to kill you, d.

01:10:56.237 --> 01:10:57.424
Don't threaten me, Lou.

01:10:57.947 --> 01:10:59.523
You're not the stud
you used to be.

01:11:00.415 --> 01:11:02.289
In fact, people
say you're through.

01:11:02.672 --> 01:11:04.082
You just don't know it yet.

01:11:05.078 --> 01:11:06.677
You remember
the first one, d?

01:11:08.342 --> 01:11:10.795
I mean, the first real one.
I do.

01:11:11.648 --> 01:11:14.165
It felt like freedom.

01:11:15.365 --> 01:11:17.247
Knowing what you can do
to the world.

01:11:18.968 --> 01:11:22.029
The next time...
You didn't feel a thing.

01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:26.567
No guilt, pain,
remorse, fear.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.701
We can change the world
with what we do.

01:11:31.822 --> 01:11:34.060
There is nothing
to be afraid of, is there

01:11:35.683 --> 01:11:36.953
the devil won't come.

01:11:38.248 --> 01:11:39.992
There is nothing
to stop you.

01:11:41.234 --> 01:11:42.129
Till you lose it.

01:11:47.125 --> 01:11:47.844
Exactly.

01:11:50.817 --> 01:11:51.865
Until you lose it.

01:11:55.063 --> 01:11:56.492
And when that happens, d...

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.341
You feel everything.

01:12:19.003 --> 01:12:19.573
Remember me?

01:12:21.543 --> 01:12:24.003
Your stepfather and mother
discussed it with me.

01:12:24.162 --> 01:12:24.769
Get out of here!

01:12:25.079 --> 01:12:27.222
We've decided this is
a bad place for you.

01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:30.570
You don't like it here,
do you, Lucy?

01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:32.063
Good.

01:12:34.252 --> 01:12:34.836
You can't come in!

01:12:35.219 --> 01:12:36.263
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

01:12:36.638 --> 01:12:37.775
You never gave
a shit before!

01:12:40.828 --> 01:12:41.888
I do now, Stan.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:45.942
Listen, Lucy, I get off
hurting bad people.

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.465
You don't have a problem
with that, do you?

01:12:51.405 --> 01:12:54.313
After this, neither of us
will have to worry, ok?

01:13:52.611 --> 01:13:54.346
Where the hell
are you going?

01:13:54.944 --> 01:13:55.852
I gotta piss, Lou.

01:13:56.339 --> 01:13:56.991
Sit down.

01:13:57.724 --> 01:13:58.359
Lou, let her go.

01:14:04.623 --> 01:14:05.751
What do you want
me to do, Lou?

01:14:07.535 --> 01:14:08.157
Go right here?

01:14:09.042 --> 01:14:10.282
I said, sit down.

01:14:11.545 --> 01:14:14.008
No one's going nowhere
until this is over.

01:14:16.517 --> 01:14:18.641
Piss in your mouth
for all I care.

01:14:36.130 --> 01:14:37.007
So, what time is it?

01:14:37.553 --> 01:14:38.155
Piss off!

01:14:59.432 --> 01:15:00.209
This is wrong, man.

01:15:01.761 --> 01:15:02.491
This is just wrong.

01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:08.653
I can't be here for this.
This is wrong.

01:15:09.418 --> 01:15:11.533
Wrong time, wrong place.

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:12.299
D...

01:15:16.173 --> 01:15:18.042
Wrong life.

01:15:26.498 --> 01:15:28.056
Wrong life.

01:15:29.461 --> 01:15:30.303
I gotta get out of here.

01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:33.715
I'm not waiting here to die.

01:15:57.877 --> 01:15:58.379
Load!

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:12.481
Load!

01:16:16.478 --> 01:16:16.911
Load!

01:16:59.478 --> 01:17:00.230
The fourth person.

01:18:26.841 --> 01:18:27.335
Load!

01:18:29.409 --> 01:18:30.717
Barbie, you bitch.

01:18:37.441 --> 01:18:37.869
Bob!

01:18:45.261 --> 01:18:46.097
I'm out!

01:18:46.097 --> 01:18:46.785
Bob!

01:18:47.844 --> 01:18:48.402
Shut up, bitch!

01:19:14.489 --> 01:19:16.330
Bobby, no!

01:19:26.523 --> 01:19:27.317
One hour left,

01:19:27.532 --> 01:19:28.901
then all the cows
come home.

01:19:29.648 --> 01:19:32.088
Forget it. I'm taking
my own chances now.

01:19:43.717 --> 01:19:44.373
Bitch.

01:19:44.745 --> 01:19:47.233
Just kill me,
you goddamn freak.

01:19:47.367 --> 01:19:47.762
Crow.

01:19:51.144 --> 01:19:51.782
Hoss.

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:02.687
We're the only ones left.

01:21:05.841 --> 01:21:06.204
3.

01:21:09.625 --> 01:21:12.216
We're the only ones left,
moon, goddamn it!

01:21:14.296 --> 01:21:15.385
There's more, asshole,

01:21:15.925 --> 01:21:17.077
and you got
one hour left

01:21:17.273 --> 01:21:18.470
before I clean up
all of you.

01:22:03.656 --> 01:22:04.109
Cam!

01:22:10.853 --> 01:22:12.471
Ollie, Ollie, oxen
free!

01:22:17.292 --> 01:22:18.836
You goddamn snitch.

01:22:25.308 --> 01:22:27.081
All right, we're closing in
on the winners.

01:22:29.759 --> 01:22:32.179
What do you say I speed up
the action in this ballpark?

01:22:33.242 --> 01:22:35.413
The money's in the third floor
locker room.

01:22:35.774 --> 01:22:38.355
That's 15 minutes, tops.
Go get it.

01:22:58.810 --> 01:23:00.636
Hey, moon,
how do you like it?

01:23:21.739 --> 01:23:23.702
Where's Lou?

01:23:54.281 --> 01:23:55.382
Is Lou your daddy now?

01:23:57.838 --> 01:23:58.860
And is he a good daddy?

01:24:02.656 --> 01:24:03.425
We're partners, right?

01:24:04.042 --> 01:24:04.505
You and me.

01:24:06.403 --> 01:24:07.657
We've got to get
out of this joint.

01:24:08.492 --> 01:24:10.125
There's a lot of nasty
guys out there,

01:24:10.975 --> 01:24:13.562
so we'll be
very, very quiet, yeah?

01:24:17.401 --> 01:24:18.077
Take my hand.

01:24:42.966 --> 01:24:43.411
Ugly.

01:24:43.899 --> 01:24:44.733
Yucky fuckin' yuck.

01:24:45.523 --> 01:24:47.502
Probably some novice
to get that messed up.

01:24:47.823 --> 01:24:49.905
Some high-school punk
who thinks he's tough.

01:24:50.037 --> 01:24:50.201
Happens all the time.

01:24:50.886 --> 01:24:51.915
Yeah, maybe
in your world.

01:24:52.731 --> 01:24:53.242
Are we there yet?

01:24:53.763 --> 01:24:54.378
We're on the third.

01:24:55.741 --> 01:24:56.261
Split up?

01:24:56.633 --> 01:24:57.028
No.

01:24:57.708 --> 01:24:59.688
You've got 2,
and you've got 3.

01:24:59.827 --> 01:25:00.372
I've got none.

01:25:02.695 --> 01:25:03.921
You guys, you're not
gonna leave me

01:25:04.074 --> 01:25:04.865
out on my own to die.

01:25:12.122 --> 01:25:12.489
Fine.

01:25:13.967 --> 01:25:14.652
So we stick.

01:25:16.754 --> 01:25:17.038
Fine.

01:25:17.287 --> 01:25:17.596
Fine.

01:25:32.867 --> 01:25:33.652
Give me a gun!

01:25:35.283 --> 01:25:35.931
Give me a gun!

01:25:55.203 --> 01:25:57.843
You tried to kill me,
you son of a bitch!

01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:01.403
You just wanted the money
like everyone else.

01:26:03.713 --> 01:26:04.914
You thought he was special?

01:26:08.924 --> 01:26:09.998
Drop the gun, Barb.

01:26:12.123 --> 01:26:12.903
Hold still a sec.

01:26:18.005 --> 01:26:19.693
She can keep it.
My gun.

01:26:20.164 --> 01:26:20.616
No.

01:26:21.312 --> 01:26:21.770
Yes.

01:26:22.733 --> 01:26:24.120
You want to reconsider
that thought?

01:26:39.477 --> 01:26:40.398
Just don't shoot me.

01:26:47.691 --> 01:26:48.364
We're not done
yet, crow.

01:26:51.138 --> 01:26:51.812
Think she'll shoot you?

01:26:52.193 --> 01:26:53.187
Just cap her
and call it over.

01:26:53.528 --> 01:26:54.064
I can't.

01:26:54.583 --> 01:26:55.775
Because I'm between her
and the bullet.

01:26:55.908 --> 01:26:56.880
All damn day.

01:26:57.701 --> 01:26:58.288
I like her.

01:26:59.424 --> 01:27:00.283
She doesn't
get the gun.

01:27:00.428 --> 01:27:01.959
She doesn't get the gun,
she's dead.

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:04.000
Doing fine
so far.

01:27:04.147 --> 01:27:04.600
So far?

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:05.306
So far.

01:27:11.207 --> 01:27:12.712
Shoot her.
Shoot her right now.

01:27:13.173 --> 01:27:13.837
Damn it, hoss.

01:27:13.978 --> 01:27:15.417
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

01:27:17.418 --> 01:27:18.579
Look, you gave us
this third leg,

01:27:18.743 --> 01:27:20.248
and now I've gotta deal
with your emotional life?

01:27:20.657 --> 01:27:21.297
I've been playing buddy

01:27:21.444 --> 01:27:23.176
because I'm supposed to play
buddy, and so are you,

01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:25.568
and I'm sick of playing
baby-sitter.

01:27:25.763 --> 01:27:27.433
You shoot her,
and you shoot me.

01:27:28.407 --> 01:27:29.065
You hear me, crow

01:27:29.242 --> 01:27:31.041
she gets the gun,
she kills both of us.

01:27:31.195 --> 01:27:32.028
Can't you see that?

01:27:33.464 --> 01:27:34.703
Look, you're not
thinking straight.

01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:39.213
I don't want to have
to shoot you, crow.

01:28:04.464 --> 01:28:05.330
How do we settle this?

01:28:11.356 --> 01:28:12.668
Gunfight
at o.K. Corral.

01:28:13.247 --> 01:28:13.938
Don't play.

01:28:15.151 --> 01:28:15.609
Jesus.

01:28:16.136 --> 01:28:17.426
You draw first,
she dies.

01:28:17.567 --> 01:28:18.879
I draw first, she
gets the gun.

01:28:19.037 --> 01:28:19.388
Don't.

01:28:20.758 --> 01:28:23.689
Ok, partner, you there
behind the wall,

01:28:23.866 --> 01:28:25.603
you yellow-bellied
sapsucker,

01:28:26.482 --> 01:28:28.499
let the little lady have
what she wants.

01:28:28.471 --> 01:28:28.816
No.

01:28:30.617 --> 01:28:31.075
Ok, crow.

01:28:34.117 --> 01:28:34.858
I call draw.

01:28:36.012 --> 01:28:36.728
You slap leather.

01:28:37.123 --> 01:28:37.883
Stop it.

01:28:47.848 --> 01:28:48.359
Ready, partner?

01:29:15.959 --> 01:29:18.037
You're gonna shoot me
dead as dickens, aren't you?

01:29:20.863 --> 01:29:21.981
Dead as dickens.

01:29:25.405 --> 01:29:27.355
And bingo
was his name, oh!

01:29:33.115 --> 01:29:33.549
I'm rich.

01:29:59.223 --> 01:30:00.058
I want you to stay here

01:30:00.196 --> 01:30:02.520
and guard these cases,
partner. Ok?

01:30:02.985 --> 01:30:03.602
Ok.

01:30:28.955 --> 01:30:29.490
How you doing?

01:30:30.233 --> 01:30:30.713
Good.

01:30:33.402 --> 01:30:36.342
Well, tooth fairy
won't be far away now.

01:30:37.522 --> 01:30:38.522
Come on, let's go.

01:31:21.075 --> 01:31:21.986
I'm not part of this.

01:31:24.384 --> 01:31:26.409
I don't belong here.
I didn't do anything.

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:28.182
I'm...

01:31:31.202 --> 01:31:31.769
I'm going. I'm...

01:31:34.097 --> 01:31:34.582
I'm getting out.

01:31:37.068 --> 01:31:38.837
She didn't shoot at us.

01:32:01.069 --> 01:32:02.839
That's a lot of silver.

01:32:03.210 --> 01:32:04.052
They're platinum.

01:32:04.538 --> 01:32:05.003
Like 'em?

01:32:08.945 --> 01:32:10.625
You having a good time,
little girl?

01:32:13.424 --> 01:32:14.430
Yeah. Me, too.

01:32:14.913 --> 01:32:15.969
Only gonna get better.

01:32:16.648 --> 01:32:18.084
You can't get them all.

01:32:18.831 --> 01:32:21.849
But what if I'm
really, really good?

01:32:25.487 --> 01:32:26.614
You'll see.

01:32:59.002 --> 01:33:00.015
It's not gonna be
that easy.

01:33:00.206 --> 01:33:01.460
Well, then what
do you want?

01:33:01.630 --> 01:33:02.497
What happened
to those pictures?

01:33:03.212 --> 01:33:04.244
They're in my pocket.

01:33:06.295 --> 01:33:07.004
Do you want to see?

01:33:20.729 --> 01:33:21.596
Better than I expected.

01:33:23.266 --> 01:33:24.580
You want to see
the best of show?

01:33:29.702 --> 01:33:31.227
Councilman graves.
That would have done it.

01:33:31.745 --> 01:33:32.369
Would have.

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:34.990
All this work
just to get out.

01:33:36.256 --> 01:33:38.052
Just out is plenty.

01:33:39.692 --> 01:33:41.314
I didn't know I was
laundering blood money.

01:33:42.302 --> 01:33:43.707
I didn't know
who I was working for.

01:33:43.854 --> 01:33:44.490
Not until you told me.

01:33:46.245 --> 01:33:48.186
Just out.

01:33:48.816 --> 01:33:49.679
That's all I wanted.

01:33:50.106 --> 01:33:51.514
Yeah, just out.

01:33:52.481 --> 01:33:52.898
Now...

01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:55.348
Is that the money?

01:33:56.883 --> 01:33:57.844
You didn't take these.

01:33:58.541 --> 01:33:58.937
No.

01:34:00.509 --> 01:34:01.018
Who did?

01:34:02.123 --> 01:34:02.939
They were sent
to me.

01:34:03.959 --> 01:34:05.164
Somebody
with a big grudge.

01:34:11.886 --> 01:34:12.777
Who took this one?

01:34:16.508 --> 01:34:17.380
Who knew you'd be there?

01:34:19.001 --> 01:34:19.500
Bob.

01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:20.581
Bob.

01:34:22.298 --> 01:34:24.118
I just killed his wife.
It was a contract.

01:34:24.591 --> 01:34:25.205
Barbie?

01:34:27.644 --> 01:34:29.340
How did Bob find out
about that?

01:34:30.642 --> 01:34:32.064
He didn't.
You got these pictures

01:34:32.234 --> 01:34:33.998
because Bob wanted
to expose Vincent moon.

01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:37.656
So, then what does moon
have against you?

01:34:51.168 --> 01:34:52.247
Let me ask you
a question.

01:34:53.983 --> 01:34:55.891
There's a man
who's killed 26 people,

01:34:56.282 --> 01:34:57.634
some innocent,
some not.

01:34:58.342 --> 01:34:59.227
26?

01:34:59.816 --> 01:35:01.750
Yeah, 26,
not including today.

01:35:03.062 --> 01:35:05.138
And if when you ask
why he did what he did,

01:35:05.331 --> 01:35:07.364
he's got reasons
he can tell you,

01:35:07.872 --> 01:35:08.618
would that
make it all right?

01:35:12.504 --> 01:35:13.362
No.

01:35:14.664 --> 01:35:15.050
No.

01:35:17.523 --> 01:35:18.367
I didn't think so.

01:35:22.007 --> 01:35:22.759
Don't make any calls.

01:35:22.946 --> 01:35:24.006
I'll call you
when it's over.

01:35:27.702 --> 01:35:28.078
Just...

01:35:28.932 --> 01:35:29.724
Stay out of sight.

01:35:33.021 --> 01:35:34.131
I never asked you why.

01:35:36.849 --> 01:35:37.625
Why you helped me.

01:35:41.025 --> 01:35:42.230
Doesn't matter anymore.

01:35:58.195 --> 01:36:00.136
All right, Louie,
there's only 3 left.

01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:02.142
Come see me
in the meeting room.

01:36:02.601 --> 01:36:04.363
Gather for the grand finale.

01:36:27.970 --> 01:36:28.344
Lucy.

01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:30.445
Lucy.

01:36:31.316 --> 01:36:31.957
How was your day?

01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:33.972
I'm cold, Lou.

01:36:34.526 --> 01:36:36.007
I'll be just
a little longer.

01:36:37.092 --> 01:36:38.459
Then we'll go
to a hotel.

01:36:39.664 --> 01:36:42.179
Then we'll get you
a nice, hot bath, ok?

01:36:42.647 --> 01:36:43.579
Ok.

01:36:47.794 --> 01:36:48.828
You can call me daddy.

01:36:49.683 --> 01:36:50.525
Daddy.

01:36:50.690 --> 01:36:51.895
I'm doing good for us.

01:36:52.981 --> 01:36:53.721
Ok.

01:37:08.649 --> 01:37:09.780
Kill that creep,

01:37:10.303 --> 01:37:11.187
will ya, Marcus?

01:37:40.238 --> 01:37:40.855
Marcus.

01:37:41.177 --> 01:37:43.373
That's it.
Game's over. We win.

01:37:44.076 --> 01:37:45.998
They're all dead?
What about d?

01:37:46.501 --> 01:37:47.654
Just you, me, and Lou.

01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:50.471
Can you come to where
we first all met?

01:37:50.850 --> 01:37:52.114
Yeah. Yeah, all right.

01:37:55.077 --> 01:37:57.272
Focus. You can do this.

01:38:06.843 --> 01:38:08.477
And baby
makes 3.

01:38:14.224 --> 01:38:16.401
Purgatory preset
time lock is released.

01:38:17.290 --> 01:38:18.225
Personnel transfer...

01:38:41.542 --> 01:38:44.287
Si, si.
I am an asshole,

01:38:44.836 --> 01:38:46.225
but everybody
in here understands

01:38:46.378 --> 01:38:47.313
how these things work,

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.581
or else you wouldn't
have made it this far.

01:38:50.630 --> 01:38:51.838
So where do we go from here?

01:38:52.329 --> 01:38:54.192
Well, I'll tell you
where we go from here.

01:38:54.352 --> 01:38:55.031
We know.

01:38:55.347 --> 01:38:56.233
Damn it, Vincent.

01:38:56.663 --> 01:38:58.375
I'm so excited
about this.

01:38:58.990 --> 01:39:01.763
You and Marcus...
2 of the best.

01:39:02.261 --> 01:39:03.308
What a challenge.

01:39:04.046 --> 01:39:05.136
You haven't
lost your skill

01:39:05.288 --> 01:39:06.995
since you went into
management, have you?

01:39:07.498 --> 01:39:08.846
No. I've been practicing.

01:39:09.394 --> 01:39:11.685
We don't want 3 left.
We want one.

01:39:12.698 --> 01:39:14.656
The last little Indian
that could.

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:16.486
It's so bent and twisted.

01:39:17.145 --> 01:39:19.572
I know exactly where
you're coming from, Vincent.

01:39:20.752 --> 01:39:21.856
This is beautiful.

01:39:22.015 --> 01:39:24.130
I am so glad
that we all agree.

01:39:28.367 --> 01:39:30.518
We're all gonna
kill each other? Why?

01:39:36.018 --> 01:39:36.828
I thought we won.

01:39:40.103 --> 01:39:41.071
But we won!

01:39:44.828 --> 01:39:46.263
Very classy, Vincent.

01:39:46.703 --> 01:39:49.431
Final stage.
This is the good part.

01:39:50.437 --> 01:39:50.744
Uno.

01:39:53.045 --> 01:39:53.523
Dos.

01:39:56.771 --> 01:39:57.648
And to the lady.

01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:02.601
Redemption time, people.

01:40:05.907 --> 01:40:08.316
Time for some good
old-fashioned redemption.

01:40:18.115 --> 01:40:19.090
Winner takes all.

01:40:20.086 --> 01:40:21.648
I don't belong here.

01:40:21.781 --> 01:40:23.243
You're the first one
down, lady.

01:40:26.835 --> 01:40:27.918
Let's do this.

01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:31.690
3...

01:40:51.227 --> 01:40:51.936
2...

01:40:58.916 --> 01:40:59.650
Oh, Lou...

01:41:00.932 --> 01:41:02.651
Did I forget
to put bullets in your gun?

01:41:04.518 --> 01:41:06.166
Rat-fucking ass.

01:41:11.013 --> 01:41:12.644
It's not fair, Vincent.

01:41:14.038 --> 01:41:14.572
You know, Lou,

01:41:15.245 --> 01:41:17.156
nobody can ever blame you
for wanting to kill somebody

01:41:17.345 --> 01:41:18.141
that raped your daughter,

01:41:18.693 --> 01:41:20.607
but, man, you always been
a little bit too bloody,

01:41:21.226 --> 01:41:21.928
way too bloody.

01:41:22.937 --> 01:41:24.858
To tell you the truth,
you scare us.

01:41:25.358 --> 01:41:26.422
That's what I do...

01:41:28.030 --> 01:41:29.564
Scare bad people.

01:41:29.939 --> 01:41:31.714
Syndicate feels
you're an issue now.

01:41:32.278 --> 01:41:34.617
You know, you've developed
this problem, you know?

01:41:35.039 --> 01:41:37.730
Parental responsibilities,
stuff like that.

01:41:38.622 --> 01:41:40.750
None of your
goddamned business.

01:41:41.089 --> 01:41:42.249
It's all our business.

01:41:51.206 --> 01:41:51.866
So you knew.

01:41:52.188 --> 01:41:55.083
When you passed out
the guns, I knew.

01:41:56.170 --> 01:41:57.517
Lou was too dangerous.

01:41:58.095 --> 01:41:59.630
Definitely needed the edge.

01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:05.780
All gone.

01:42:07.155 --> 01:42:08.149
There's still
you and me.

01:42:09.570 --> 01:42:11.276
Yeah, you and me, amigo.

01:42:12.836 --> 01:42:13.457
Just one of us
walks away.

01:42:13.647 --> 01:42:14.150
Is that it?

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:16.061
Or is it none?

01:42:17.471 --> 01:42:18.434
I get it. Yeah.

01:42:19.261 --> 01:42:21.034
Syndicate wanted
us all to disappear,

01:42:21.926 --> 01:42:22.336
didn't they?

01:42:22.698 --> 01:42:23.816
'Fraid so, Marcus.

01:42:24.892 --> 01:42:26.491
You know, maybe they
don't kill us all today,

01:42:26.641 --> 01:42:27.318
but sooner or later...

01:42:29.164 --> 01:42:29.815
So I say, hey...

01:42:30.424 --> 01:42:31.216
Why wait?

01:42:32.766 --> 01:42:34.987
Let's just go out in a blast
right fuckin' now.

01:42:40.584 --> 01:42:41.325
Come on, Marcus.

01:42:42.755 --> 01:42:43.340
Let's get down.

01:42:48.699 --> 01:42:49.256
Your call.

01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:03.873
Fuckin' Marcus

01:43:05.803 --> 01:43:07.083
I used to be
way quicker than that.

01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:08.528
I'm getting slow.

01:43:10.063 --> 01:43:10.728
Practice.

01:43:11.595 --> 01:43:12.307
I gotta practice.

01:43:13.018 --> 01:43:14.308
Yeah, I gotta practice more.

01:43:19.183 --> 01:43:20.366
It's a bit late,
old fella.

01:43:21.413 --> 01:43:24.013
Oh, what a tangled
web we weave

01:43:24.215 --> 01:43:27.476
when first we
practice to deceive.

01:43:29.487 --> 01:43:30.059
You still...

01:43:32.757 --> 01:43:34.717
You still don't
mean shit, Vincent.

01:44:05.564 --> 01:44:07.586
What a pathetic way
to go out...

01:44:08.828 --> 01:44:10.658
For a couple of studs
like us.

01:44:15.610 --> 01:44:16.585
Gimme your gun.

01:44:18.799 --> 01:44:19.754
I'll do you in.

01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:23.207
Suicide is a sin,
you know?

01:44:26.276 --> 01:44:27.913
Oh, don't worry
about me.

01:44:30.117 --> 01:44:31.532
I can't go yet.

01:44:34.442 --> 01:44:36.811
I've got my little girl
to look after.

01:44:38.741 --> 01:44:40.303
She's been
taken care of, Lou.

01:44:45.245 --> 01:44:46.392
You didn't.

01:44:51.919 --> 01:44:53.172
She was my daughter.

01:44:55.738 --> 01:44:58.063
She was my
real daughter, Marcus.

01:45:05.721 --> 01:45:07.147
Tell me
you didn't kill her,

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:09.883
even if it's
a goddamned lie.

01:45:10.782 --> 01:45:12.204
I didn't know
she was your kid.

01:45:13.419 --> 01:45:15.750
I was making good
for us.

01:45:21.993 --> 01:45:23.167
And you killed her.

01:45:25.884 --> 01:45:26.970
Make good now, Lou.

01:45:28.638 --> 01:45:29.304
Make good now.

01:45:32.247 --> 01:45:33.610
Gladly, Marcus.

01:46:19.421 --> 01:46:22.044
The man said to come in
when all the shooting was done.

01:46:22.415 --> 01:46:24.421
He said he wasn't really
going to kill you,

01:46:24.879 --> 01:46:26.120
just make you look dead.

01:46:26.572 --> 01:46:29.501
He said he was going to shoot
you here, not here or here.

01:46:30.090 --> 01:46:30.520
What?

01:46:31.913 --> 01:46:32.691
What man?

01:47:10.373 --> 01:47:11.345
Are you all right?

01:47:14.103 --> 01:47:14.637
I will be.

01:47:17.671 --> 01:47:18.555
I will be.

01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:35.948
Said this was for you, too.

01:47:56.112 --> 01:47:56.785
Lady...

01:47:57.689 --> 01:47:58.909
Are you my new mommy?

01:48:06.084 --> 01:48:07.210
I suppose I am, sweetie.

01:48:09.623 --> 01:48:10.134
Buckle up.

01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:21.707
Do you like that?

01:48:22.158 --> 01:48:23.593
I love mambo, don't you?
