WEBVTT

01:25.040 --> 01:26.633
She's coming down.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.358
William!

01:32.520 --> 01:34.989
- Yes, ma'am?
- Has my daughter-in-law telephoned?

01:35.200 --> 01:37.999
Mrs. Lisa phoned.
She'll be here at 4:00.

01:38.200 --> 01:41.033
It's 4:00 now. We'll be pouring tea
in the drawing room this afternoon.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.634
Very good, ma'am.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.950
- Mrs. Lisa is bringing someone.
- Yes, ma'am

01:45.360 --> 01:47.192
- Show them in here.
- Very good, ma'am.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.869
And please tell Miss Charlotte
to be down in 10 minutes.

01:51.680 --> 01:54.991
William, how many times must I tell you
not to have the table here at this time?

01:55.160 --> 01:56.195
Sorry, ma'am.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.918
What's that noise?

02:02.080 --> 02:04.276
Whoever is doing that
will kindly stop.

02:04.480 --> 02:05.595
I imagine whoever said that--

02:05.760 --> 02:06.909
Yes, that's Mother.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.191
I'll go smooth the path.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.996
Messy things, pipes. I like them.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.760
- Your coat, sir.
- Oh, yes, yes.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.678
Thank you.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.949
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.759
There can be no harm
in talking. I thought--

02:29.000 --> 02:32.675
Dr. Jaquith, my mother-in-law,
Mrs. Henry Windle Vale.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.632
- How do you do?
- I will not pretend...

02:34.800 --> 02:36.711
...you've been brought here
with my approval.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.998
No matter what Lisa may have told you,
my daughter, Charlotte, is no more ill...

02:40.160 --> 02:41.150
...than a molting canary.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.829
That's what we hope he will confirm.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.600
Mother's disapproval isn't personal.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.760
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.031
The last member
of your profession I consulted...

02:53.200 --> 02:55.077
...warned me my heart
would be the finish of me.

02:55.280 --> 02:57.590
The fact I've outlived him
for 15 years has not increased...

02:57.760 --> 02:59.239
...my meager trust of the pack of you.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.238
A highly sensible reaction.

03:01.520 --> 03:04.353
Please try to relax
your grim disapproval...

03:04.560 --> 03:06.278
...where this doctor is concerned.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.233
We're honored by the visit
of the foremost psychiatrist...

03:09.400 --> 03:10.470
...of the whole country.

03:10.680 --> 03:14.435
It was pretty sweet of him
to come from New York to Boston.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.473
Generally, he doesn't go to see people.
They go to see him.

03:17.680 --> 03:21.753
Wouldn't hurt if you added that's
from lack of time, not vanity.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.349
And, Mother, before I forget it...

03:24.560 --> 03:26.756
...don't call him
Dr. Jaquith in front of Charlotte.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.874
That's his name, isn't it?

03:29.080 --> 03:31.833
Yes, but forget the "doctor."
Make it "mister."

03:32.040 --> 03:35.920
She'll shut up like a clam if she suspects
we've trapped her into an examination.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.430
So please try to cooperate.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.551
I've already sent for her.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.234
My little girl will be here directly.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.233
Miss Charlotte.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.878
Your mother's waiting
in the drawing room.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.478
Is it facts about
my daughter you want or Lisa's fences?

04:15.680 --> 04:18.798
Anything interesting.
Charlotte was a late child.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.753
There were three boys.
After a while, this girl.

04:21.960 --> 04:24.315
"Child of my old age," I call her.

04:24.520 --> 04:25.715
I was well into my 40s.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.639
Her father passed on
soon after she was born.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.797
My ugly duckling.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.474
Of course, it's true
that all late children are marked.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.399
Often such children aren't wanted.
That can mark them.

04:36.920 --> 04:39.230
I've kept her close always.

04:39.440 --> 04:43.115
When she was young, foolish,
I made decisions for her.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.311
Always the right decisions.

04:45.520 --> 04:48.990
A child should wish
to repay a mother's kindness.

04:50.480 --> 04:53.950
There you are, Charlotte.
I'm so glad to see you.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.158
Hello, dear.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.795
This is my very good friend,
Mr. Jaquith.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.674
I ran into him
and brought him by for tea.

05:04.880 --> 05:08.077
I hoped you and Mother
would be pleased.

05:08.280 --> 05:09.634
How do you do?

05:11.120 --> 05:12.235
Well?

05:12.400 --> 05:14.357
Has the cat got your tongue?

05:25.160 --> 05:28.437
I apologize for my daughter's
bad manners, doctor.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.477
Mother, please!

05:32.440 --> 05:35.592
I will not countenance deceit, Lisa,
against one of my own flesh and blood.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.314
Nor will I approve her nonsense.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.756
Lisa says that
your latest peculiarities...

05:40.960 --> 05:43.349
...your crying, your secretiveness...

05:43.560 --> 05:46.313
...indicate the verge
of a nervous breakdown.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.959
Is that what you're trying to achieve?

05:48.560 --> 05:52.599
Charlotte, dear,
believe me, I'm trying to help.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.918
Dr. Jaquith has
a sanitarium. In Vermont.

05:56.240 --> 05:59.551
Probably one of those places with
a high wire fence and yowling inmates.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.991
I wouldn't want anyone
to have that notion.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.238
Cascade is where people go
when they're tired.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.238
Like you go to the seashore.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.954
The very word "psychiatry"____

06:11.280 --> 06:15.114
Doesn't it fill you with shame?
A member of our family?

06:15.320 --> 06:18.790
There's nothing shameful
or frightening about it.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.071
It's simple, what I do.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.920
People come to a fork in the road.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.236
They don't know which way to go.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.397
I put up a signpost:

06:28.560 --> 06:30.631
"Not that way. This way."

06:39.920 --> 06:41.354
Really, Mother.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.909
Excuse me. Miss Vale?

06:48.240 --> 06:51.312
I wonder if I might ask you a favor.

06:51.920 --> 06:56.551
Would you show me this house?
One doesn't often get the chance.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.911
I had a look at the downstairs
when I came in.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.720
There's nothing
like these Boston homes.

07:03.920 --> 07:08.073
Here on Marlborough Street
or Beacon Hill they stand like bastions.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.959
Firm, proud, resisting the new.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.797
Houses turned in, hugging their pride.

07:15.440 --> 07:20.071
- Introverted, doctor.
- I wouldn't know about that.

07:20.240 --> 07:24.871
I don't believe in scientific terms.
I leave that to fakirs and writers.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.916
That's the room where I was born.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.832
- My mother's.
- Fine room.

07:34.040 --> 07:35.838
Do you think so?

07:36.040 --> 07:38.839
I'd prefer to see your room.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.232
- I'm not your patient yet.
- Nobody thinks you ever will be.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.789
I've seen the rooms of many people.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.515
Of course, if you don't want to____

07:51.280 --> 07:53.237
It's on the floor above.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.958
When I was 17,
I came in once after midnight.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.629
That tread hasn't been fixed since.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.118
She locks her door.
Make a note of it.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.351
Significant, isn't it?

08:17.560 --> 08:20.029
It signifies that it's your door.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.834
A woman's home is her castle.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.558
My castle, doctor.

08:36.840 --> 08:39.480
This was built to last a lifetime.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.270
Solid.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.636
Enduring and inescapable.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.317
Are you comfortable here?

08:46.920 --> 08:49.560
I try to be. I'm here most of the time.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.513
Why, what's this?

08:54.320 --> 08:55.958
Did you do these?

08:56.560 --> 08:58.073
Why shouldn't I?

08:58.280 --> 09:00.191
The point is how you could.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.879
They're professional.
Do you mind if I look?

09:05.640 --> 09:07.313
No, I don't mind.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.240
They aren't difficult.
I get the raw ivory from New York.

09:11.440 --> 09:15.434
I have the tools.
It's just a matter of the doing.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.278
And the skill!

09:18.880 --> 09:20.757
This is very good detail.

09:21.200 --> 09:25.876
I admire people who are clever
with their hands. I'm clumsy.

09:27.440 --> 09:31.434
I should think you were the least
clumsy person I'd ever met.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.551
This is excellent!

09:36.000 --> 09:37.274
You may have one.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.869
- May I? Any one?
- Of course.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.991
All except this one.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.838
While I worked on it,
my mother sent for me.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.274
My chisel slipped.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.313
- A pity to ruin such a nice box.
- Yes.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.680
- I'll get something to wrap it in.
- No.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.872
Any old piece of paper will do.

10:05.080 --> 10:10.314
Do you happen to have a cigarette?
I left my tobacco in my coat.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.440
Do you think I hide cigarettes
in my room?

10:14.760 --> 10:16.398
Where do I hide them?

10:16.760 --> 10:18.592
Behind the books?

10:19.080 --> 10:22.630
Cigarettes and books
my mother won't let me read?

10:22.840 --> 10:25.434
A secret life hidden
behind a locked door?

10:25.640 --> 10:30.111
- It was the box that reminded me.
- How very perceiving you are.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.152
How very right you are.

10:32.360 --> 10:35.910
I was about to hide this album.
You should read it.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.794
It's a shame to miss your amusement.

10:38.960 --> 10:42.316
The intimate journal
of Miss Vale, spinster.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.716
Can I convince you
I don't wish to pry?

10:44.880 --> 10:47.076
You must pry. I insist you do.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.830
Nothing to frighten you.
A few snapshots, a memento.

10:51.040 --> 10:55.273
A record of my trip up the coast
of Africa with my mother.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.632
There's a picture of our ship,
a P&O steamer.

10:58.840 --> 11:02.310
You wouldn't have known me then.
I was 20.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.194
Oh, I say.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.193
That was a scorcher.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.510
Leslie, you act so funny.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.513
Do I?

11:29.320 --> 11:33.678
- I thought men didn't like prudes.
- You're gorgeous, Charlotte.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.353
Give us another.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.631
There's the first mate.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.719
There's always lots of work
before we dock.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.269
- Are you going ashore?
- Are we, pet?

11:43.440 --> 11:46.273
If I can't go, you won't, will you?

11:46.480 --> 11:50.360
- Even if that girl from New York does?
- Not likely.

11:50.680 --> 11:53.035
There's nothing like you in Africa.

11:53.240 --> 11:55.197
There he is again. I'd better go.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.474
- Leslie.
- Yes?

11:57.640 --> 11:59.199
Come here.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.954
Darling. Dearest darling.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.031
<i>/ had read that part in novels.</i>

12:13.200 --> 12:15.430
<i>About men not liking prudes.</i>

12:15.640 --> 12:17.995
<i>That's all I had to go by, novels.</i>

12:18.160 --> 12:21.312
<i>Leslie said he'd rather have me...</i>

12:21.520 --> 12:24.478
<i>...than any girl. I was so responsive.</i>

12:24.680 --> 12:29.038
<i>The others were like schoolgirls
compared to my lovemaking.</i>

12:35.880 --> 12:37.951
Where are your glasses?

12:38.320 --> 12:39.993
They're in my bag.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.759
They're so unattractive.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.359
- Other girls don't--
- Put them on.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.113
You'll never get another pair of eyes.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.438
What's that book?

12:47.640 --> 12:51.634
Marconi. Wireless. I'm studying it.

12:51.840 --> 12:56.277
- From whom are you learning this?
- Mr. Trotter lent me the book.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.360
- You mean the wireless officer?
- Yes.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.995
Are we taking the shore trip tonight?

13:02.200 --> 13:03.429
I think not.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.117
Then could I go alone?

13:07.280 --> 13:08.873
I don't mean really alone.

13:09.040 --> 13:13.318
The hostess is organizing groups.
I said I'd ask you.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.239
Remember, we're not
commercial travelers.

13:16.440 --> 13:20.718
It's bad enough to associate
with these tourists onboard.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.753
You have the vigor of a typical
American tourist.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.193
Sit down and write something
to someone.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.677
You've behaved
like an excited servant girl.

13:35.160 --> 13:38.039
<i>That night I left her in her room.</i>

13:38.800 --> 13:41.030
<i>/ would go read in the library.</i>

13:41.280 --> 13:43.669
<i>When she looked for me,
I wasn't there.</i>

13:43.880 --> 13:47.236
<i>She couldn't know I was with Leslie.
But she knew I hadn't gone ashore.</i>

13:47.440 --> 13:49.351
<i>She'd checked on that.</i>

13:50.040 --> 13:52.395
<i>Leslie and I always
had to be discreet.</i>

13:52.600 --> 13:56.355
<i>Because of Mother,
and also his position.</i>

13:57.240 --> 14:00.232
<i>Our favorite try sting place
was on the freight deck...</i>

14:00.440 --> 14:02.954
<i>...among canvas-covered automobiles.</i>

14:03.360 --> 14:05.715
<i>There was a particular limousine.</i>

14:11.800 --> 14:12.790
Come out at once.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.070
Trotter.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.353
I don't care. I'm glad.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.074
- Go to your cabin.
- I want to marry her.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.315
We're engaged.

14:26.520 --> 14:29.717
Do officers address
a passenger in that manner?

14:29.920 --> 14:32.070
Report to my quarters at once.

14:34.520 --> 14:35.954
Go to your cabin.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.752
<i>/ had said I was glad,
and I was glad.</i>

14:43.960 --> 14:46.839
<i>He defied my mother
and put me on a throne.</i>

14:47.040 --> 14:49.111
<i>And before a witness too.</i>

14:49.320 --> 14:51.880
<i>It was the proudest moment
of my life.</i>

14:52.080 --> 14:54.959
My moment didn't last long,
as you can see.

14:55.680 --> 14:59.753
My mother didn't think Leslie
was suitable for a Vale.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.312
What man is suitable?
She's never found one.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.356
What man would ever want me?

15:06.520 --> 15:10.070
I'm fat. My mother doesn't approve
of dieting.

15:10.280 --> 15:13.398
Look at my shoes.
My mother approves of sensible shoes.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.958
Look at the books. She approves
of good, solid books.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.517
I'm her well-loved daughter.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.394
I'm her companion. I'm her servant.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.193
My mother says!

15:25.360 --> 15:28.716
My mother!

15:38.840 --> 15:42.196
You won't get new eyes
if you spoil them with tears.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.631
Dr. Jaquith...

15:46.800 --> 15:48.677
...can you help me?

15:49.200 --> 15:50.952
Help you?

15:52.080 --> 15:54.151
When you were talking____

15:55.000 --> 15:57.514
About the fork in the road____

15:58.480 --> 16:01.438
There are other forks
further along the road.

16:01.640 --> 16:02.789
So many.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.240
You don't need my help.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.158
Here are your glasses.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.510
Put away your book,
come downstairs.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.233
I'll go ahead.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.710
Thank you again for this.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.350
It's as I said, isn't it? Nonsense.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.517
She is most seriously ill.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.911
- Charlotte is?
- Thanks to you.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.758
- Did you say--
- Mrs. Vale...

16:41.960 --> 16:46.318
...if you planned to destroy her life,
you couldn't have done better.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.357
How? By having exercised
a mother's rights?

16:48.560 --> 16:51.518
A mother's rights? Twaddle.
A child has rights.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.473
A person has rights
to discover mistakes...

16:54.680 --> 16:57.035
...to grow and bloom
in her own soil.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.672
Are we getting into botany?
Are we flowers?

17:03.400 --> 17:05.994
- Gloomy William.
- Hello, Miss June.

17:06.160 --> 17:09.039
You should get yourself a top piece.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.629
Like Mrs. Adams put on Charles.

17:11.840 --> 17:13.751
It's worth considering.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.839
- I have been worried--
- Black, or--

17:17.040 --> 17:19.839
Well, maybe red.
We'll think about it.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.634
- Hello, Aunt Charlotte.
- Hello, June.

17:22.840 --> 17:26.629
- You look ravishing. New dress?
- No, June.

17:26.840 --> 17:29.195
Anyway, it's devastating.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.718
Do you think we should
wear our skirts so short?

17:32.880 --> 17:34.871
June, mind your manners.
Hello, Grandma.

17:35.080 --> 17:36.718
- Why are you always late?
- I'm sorry.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.633
- Charlotte, will you pour tea?
Will you have tea?

17:39.840 --> 17:42.150
I'm heading for cocktails later.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.636
- Who's this?
- Doctor Jaquith.

17:44.840 --> 17:48.276
I'm June. You've heard of us,
June and December?

17:48.480 --> 17:50.517
- My infant.
- What's that?

17:52.520 --> 17:54.750
Charlotte gave it to you?

17:55.240 --> 17:57.595
One of her own precious, private____

17:58.040 --> 18:00.236
Aunt Charlotte, fess up.
A romance?

18:00.400 --> 18:02.835
Isn't this to be discussed?

18:03.040 --> 18:04.394
June, will you please--

18:04.560 --> 18:07.552
What's this? A hangover,
I believe it is.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.751
Aunt Charlotte's got the shakes.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.677
Go on, torture me.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.951
You like making fun of me?

18:15.120 --> 18:17.714
You think it's fun making fun of me!

18:20.520 --> 18:22.796
- Nice work, infant.
- I didn't mean--

18:23.720 --> 18:25.757
We've always ragged her.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.474
- It's just a game.
A nervous breakdown.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.638
No Vale has ever had
a nervous breakdown.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.911
There's one having one now.

18:35.880 --> 18:38.235
I suggest a few weeks at Cascade.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.956
I've been waiting for you.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.037
Looking lovelier than ever.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.595
- Good to see you.
- Sorry I'm late.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.717
- How is Charlotte?
- Better every week.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.718
She's almost well,
but she doesn't believe it.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.314
The prospect still looks dark to her.

19:09.520 --> 19:12.512
Her sickness is like
going through a tunnel.

19:12.720 --> 19:17.430
It's dark right at the end.
You'll find her feeling depressed.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.597
I told her she's a fledgling.

19:19.760 --> 19:22.479
It's time for her to get
out of the nest and try her own wings.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.830
Going home has struck her hard.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.798
I haven't told her yet
there's any alternative.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.230
- You think well of it?
- A gift from heaven.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.590
I'll tell her your plan later.

19:31.760 --> 19:35.913
Charlotte's lost a lot of weight.
She's a pretty sick girl.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.153
Charlotte, darling.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.709
I'm so glad to see you.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.912
Doctor Jaquith says
you're much better.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.474
That's what he says.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.079
This is Miss Trask, Mrs. Vale.

19:56.240 --> 19:59.119
She's chief of my police force.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.672
- What's this?
- I'm helping her weave.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.713
Excuse me,
I have a million things to do.

20:07.360 --> 20:10.000
The oculist said you don't need these.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.639
I feel undressed.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.309
It's good for you to feel that way.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.959
- How's Mother?
- Fine.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.919
She's having fun
visiting her children.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.350
Spending a month with me now.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.870
- Has Doctor Jaquith told you?
- What?

20:27.080 --> 20:30.789
He says I'm well enough to leave.
I've got to go home.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.758
I dread it so terribly.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.429
It's awful not to want to see Mother.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.399
Stop, look, listen.
New England conscience.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.876
Perhaps you don't have to. May I?

20:41.080 --> 20:44.960
Later. We'll see how she behaves.
We have a scheme.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.356
- What is it?
- I'm not telling.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.836
Marvelous chance, though,
to use your reeducation.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.236
My time for pleasure is up.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.590
I'll show Lisa around the place.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.916
You can show the rest later.

20:57.120 --> 21:01.353
- Meet me outside?
- I've been thrown out of better places.

21:06.800 --> 21:10.475
This morning I referred
to a quotation, remember?

21:11.880 --> 21:13.473
Yes, Walt Whitman's.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.559
I had it typed out on a slip of paper.

21:18.040 --> 21:21.670
If Walt didn't have you in mind,
he had others like you.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.275
He put into words
what I'd like to say.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.153
Better than I could express it.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.275
Read it.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.429
Bye.

21:32.720 --> 21:33.994
Bye.

21:37.920 --> 21:41.834
<i>Untold want, by life and land
Ne 'er granted</i>

21:42.320 --> 21:47.076
<i>Now, voyager, sail thou forth
To seek and find</i>

22:05.760 --> 22:07.592
We'll be on our way soon.

22:07.800 --> 22:10.189
The others have all gone.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.550
We'll all be ashore in a minute.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.677
Why are we waiting?
- Miss Beauchamp.

22:14.880 --> 22:17.440
She hasn't left her cabin
since New York.

22:17.640 --> 22:21.520
I saw her once. She looks pale,
but interesting.

22:21.720 --> 22:24.758
- More interesting if she's not late.
- Shh. Here she is.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.636
We've been waiting for you.

22:40.840 --> 22:42.160
I'm sorry.

22:51.760 --> 22:54.195
Miss Beauchamp. Miss Beauchamp.

22:54.360 --> 22:57.671
- Let me introduce Mr. Durrance.
- How do you do?

22:57.840 --> 23:01.037
There's only one shore vehicle left.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.914
Would you share yours with him?

23:04.480 --> 23:08.155
- Really--
- That's splendid. Miss Beauchamp.

23:08.360 --> 23:11.398
You're traveling alone and he is.
That's splendid.

23:11.560 --> 23:13.039
Splendid.

23:13.320 --> 23:17.200
It's an inconvenience.
If it's too much, just say so.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.638
Now, pull your own weight.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.360
I have taught you the technique,
use it.

23:25.520 --> 23:29.195
Forget you're a highbrowed
New Englander. Take part, contribute.

23:29.360 --> 23:32.557
Be interested in everything
and everybody.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.238
Sure you don't mind?

23:36.560 --> 23:40.349
Of course not.
I can stand it if you can.

23:40.560 --> 23:44.713
Are you a typical tourist? I am.
Not that you wouldn't know.

23:44.880 --> 23:48.589
It's foolish not to be
if seeing something new.

23:48.800 --> 23:52.191
I want to see everything.
The Queen's staircase____

23:52.520 --> 23:54.397
Why are you smiling?

23:55.280 --> 23:57.191
I was thinking of my mother.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.800
Your mother?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.799
Remember, we're not
commercial travelers.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.753
It's bad enough to associate
with these tourists onboard.

24:07.600 --> 24:12.720
- I'd be glad to see anything you like.
- You're a good sport.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.474
- The baba all right?
- Yes, thank you.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.279
Good.

24:28.240 --> 24:31.312
Will you excuse me to send
a cable to my wife?

24:31.520 --> 24:34.478
I should have this morning.
Isobel gets nervous.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.273
Of course.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.312
You must send it at once.

24:38.480 --> 24:40.391
Here, while I'm gone.

24:53.080 --> 24:54.559
I wish I understood you.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.434
Since we just met, how could you?

24:59.240 --> 25:00.639
I won't be long.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.557
He wishes he understood me.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.079
He wishes.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.795
That's done.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.072
I've ordered us Cointreaus.

25:24.960 --> 25:28.715
- You're different from what I expected.
- How?

25:28.920 --> 25:32.390
You're more comfortable to talk to.
Miss Beauchamp.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.916
I'm not Miss Beauchamp.
Renee is in Arizona.

25:36.080 --> 25:38.799
- The cruise manager--
- I know.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.072
They all think I'm Miss Beauchamp.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.518
The purser knows I'm not.

25:44.720 --> 25:47.360
I took her space at the last moment.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.949
It was too late to be on the list.

25:50.160 --> 25:53.676
Do you intend to keep
your identity a secret?

25:53.880 --> 25:56.872
No, I would've corrected
the mistake earlier...

25:57.080 --> 25:59.754
...only it would've been awkward.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.110
I don't know why I'm telling you.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.440
- A stranger.
- I'm awfully sorry.

26:05.640 --> 26:09.031
My name is Durrance.
Jeremiah Duveaux Durrance.

26:09.240 --> 26:10.799
Silly name, isn't it?

26:10.960 --> 26:13.474
My father named me after a professor.

26:13.680 --> 26:17.230
I was J.D. in college.
My wife calls me J. Duveaux.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.556
I'm Jerry to my friends.

26:19.760 --> 26:22.320
Won't you tell me who you are?

26:22.520 --> 26:26.150
My name is Vale, V-A-L-E.

26:26.760 --> 26:29.195
If it appears on the list, it will be:

26:29.600 --> 26:31.876
"C. Vale, Boston, Massachusetts."

26:32.080 --> 26:35.869
- Are you one of the Vales?
- One of the lesser ones.

26:36.080 --> 26:39.994
Which? I don't even know
if it's Miss or Mrs.

26:40.480 --> 26:44.155
It's Aunt.
Every family has one, you know.

26:44.360 --> 26:46.112
But Aunt what?

26:47.040 --> 26:49.236
My name is Charlotte Vale.

26:49.960 --> 26:51.678
Miss Charlotte Vale.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.718
Please, let's go.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.110
I hope I didn't offend you.

27:10.240 --> 27:14.199
I was going to ask for a favor
this afternoon.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.471
I must shop for my daughters.

27:16.680 --> 27:19.433
Well, I need a woman's help.

27:20.280 --> 27:21.839
Of course.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.039
A spinster aunt is ideal to
select presents for young girls.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.996
I think you did darn well.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.476
The jewelry is just right for Beatrice.

27:34.680 --> 27:36.876
At 16 they get the urge for glamour.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.037
And a sweater for Tina.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.949
- How old is Tina?
- Here, I'll show you.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.200
My harem.

27:46.840 --> 27:49.400
- Who is knitting?
- Isobel, my wife.

27:49.600 --> 27:54.037
The picture isn't very good of her.
If she'd only smiled.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.560
That's Beatrice next to her.

27:58.440 --> 28:01.353
That must be Tina
sitting cross-legged on the grass.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.799
We hope she won't have
to wear glasses all her life.

28:05.680 --> 28:09.719
Tina won't smile either.
She thinks she's an ugly duckling.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.320
Does Tina know she wasn't wanted?

28:15.120 --> 28:18.875
- There's an odd remark.
- I don't know why I made it.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.754
Odd because it is close to true.

28:21.960 --> 28:25.840
Before she was born her mother said--
Never mind that.

28:26.040 --> 28:28.634
Here is a slight offering.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.277
For being my guide today.

28:31.440 --> 28:35.195
<i>It's a mixture of flowers
called Jolies Fleurs.</i>

28:42.160 --> 28:43.912
Thank you very much.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.796
- I'll put it on my handkerchief.
- Good.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.839
Let's meet for a cocktail
before dinner.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.757
"Silver slippers
and silver evening bag...

29:20.920 --> 29:23.514
...will be found in accessory closet."

29:24.000 --> 29:27.197
Suppose she thought I'd wear
oxfords...

29:27.720 --> 29:29.996
...and carry a shopping bag.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.677
- I'm late, I know.
- I hoped you hadn't changed your mind.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.753
What will you have?

29:55.960 --> 29:59.191
- I'll leave that to you.
- Bourbon old-fashioneds?

29:59.960 --> 30:02.474
Will you have a cigarette?

30:03.280 --> 30:04.475
Thank you.

30:12.720 --> 30:16.395
You made a striking impression
in the doorway.

30:17.880 --> 30:21.475
- Probably too much lipstick.
- Not that I'd notice.

30:22.800 --> 30:24.757
I did notice your wrap at once.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.918
I recognize fritillaries
when I see them.

30:28.120 --> 30:31.556
- Fritillaries?
- The butterfly design on your coat.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.876
Butterflies are a hobby of mine.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.071
Will you mind leaning forward?

30:36.240 --> 30:39.676
Stark lines over your shoulders
must be antennae.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.951
- What's that?
- What's what?

30:42.160 --> 30:43.958
Something on your coat.

30:44.160 --> 30:47.551
It's pinned on. Somebody
must have played a joke.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.273
Unpin it, please.

30:54.640 --> 30:57.359
This should pigeonhole me for you.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.394
What does it mean?

31:04.560 --> 31:06.312
I can't make head or tail of it.

31:06.880 --> 31:09.599
That this cape belongs to Renee.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.155
- She lent it to me.
- Oh, I see.

31:12.360 --> 31:14.112
Your wings are borrowed.

31:14.320 --> 31:16.470
They suit you just the same.

31:17.200 --> 31:21.194
They don't suit me at all.
They're perfectly ridiculous.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.835
You're right, someone's
playing a joke.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.953
- It's funnier than you know.
- You're going?

31:27.160 --> 31:31.438
- Well, J.D.
- Mac! And Deb too, as I'm alive.

31:32.040 --> 31:36.830
My old friends Deb Mclntyre and Frank.
My new friend Miss Beauchamp.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.474
How do you do?

31:38.680 --> 31:41.194
How do you do?
I'm so happy to know you.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.279
Is it the Beauchamp
who does the invitations?

31:44.480 --> 31:48.075
No, another one.
This is Camille Beauchamp.

31:48.280 --> 31:50.999
Why don't we go up to the club?

31:51.200 --> 31:52.873
We can have dinner and dance.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.394
I don't dance.

31:54.600 --> 31:57.240
I don't either,
according to my daughters.

31:57.440 --> 31:59.431
- How are they?
- Fine.

31:59.640 --> 32:03.918
- I thought you were in Buenos Aires.
- We stayed in Nassau.

32:04.120 --> 32:06.680
- Business.
- I'm glad we joined the cruise.

32:06.880 --> 32:09.440
- We'll see you later.
- Thanks.

32:13.520 --> 32:14.874
Wait a minute.

32:15.080 --> 32:17.310
Why did you run off like that?

32:17.520 --> 32:19.830
I'm tired. I'll eat in my cabin.

32:20.040 --> 32:23.112
- You'll want your friends.
- It's more.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.196
Did you have to introduce me
like that?

32:26.400 --> 32:28.960
It wasn't up to me to let the cat
out of the bag.

32:29.160 --> 32:30.434
Did I do wrong?

32:30.640 --> 32:33.598
It doesn't make my situation
any easier.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.791
Then why didn't you stop me?

32:36.000 --> 32:37.673
Why did you call me Camille?

32:37.840 --> 32:40.559
It's the only French name
I could think of.

32:40.920 --> 32:44.038
- Besides Fifi.
- That's meant to be funny?

32:44.240 --> 32:47.631
My wife calls my lighter moments
"trying to be funny."

32:47.840 --> 32:52.437
I don't blame you for feeling the same.
I intended a compliment.

32:52.640 --> 32:55.359
In that dress, you're like a camellia.

32:55.520 --> 32:57.238
Likely.

32:57.840 --> 33:01.959
You haven't a very high opinion
of yourself, have you?

33:03.920 --> 33:06.150
Perhaps this will help you know why.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.794
You showed me your album,
I'll show you mine.

33:10.520 --> 33:12.238
A picture of my family.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.557
Family is right.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.637
- Your grandmother?
- My mother.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.232
A very strong character.

33:19.440 --> 33:22.080
- These?
- My brothers and their wives.

33:22.280 --> 33:26.035
Who's the fat lady with
the heavy brows and all the hair?

33:27.360 --> 33:29.317
A spinster aunt.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.520
Where are you?
Taking the picture?

33:34.560 --> 33:37.678
I'm the fat lady with the heavy brows
and all the hair.

33:37.880 --> 33:41.191
I'm poor Aunt Charlotte. I've been ill.

33:41.400 --> 33:44.518
I've been in a sanitarium
for three months.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.791
And I'm not well yet, and I--

33:58.240 --> 33:59.594
Forgive me.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.952
Feeling better?

34:07.440 --> 34:08.953
Much.

34:09.120 --> 34:11.839
Thanks to you.
Many, many thanks to you.

34:12.040 --> 34:13.474
Thanks for what?

34:13.680 --> 34:15.432
For sharing my carriage...

34:15.600 --> 34:17.352
...for sightseeing...

34:17.920 --> 34:20.070
...for lunch and shopping...

34:20.560 --> 34:23.439
...for helping me feel
there were a few moments...

34:24.120 --> 34:26.157
...when I almost felt alive.

34:26.320 --> 34:29.039
- Thank you.
- Thank you, who?

34:30.800 --> 34:32.598
Thank you, Jerry.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.760
I must go in now.

34:36.080 --> 34:38.549
Good night, Camille.
Meet me for breakfast?

34:39.440 --> 34:41.317
- Yes.
- Sleep well.

34:42.160 --> 34:43.673
Good night.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.598
I give up.
You're no help.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.474
That gives you 10 more.
You won't make this.

35:46.880 --> 35:49.679
I haven't heard Jerry
laugh like that in years.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.672
You're good for him.

35:52.760 --> 35:54.717
I'm exhausted.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.078
Charlotte...

35:58.240 --> 36:01.073
...what has Jerry said
about his life at home?

36:01.280 --> 36:04.557
That he's married
and showed me a snapshot.

36:04.720 --> 36:06.711
- He seemed proud.
- He would.

36:06.920 --> 36:09.958
Right out of the age of chivalry,
that boy.

36:10.120 --> 36:12.589
- Charlotte?
- No, thank you.

36:13.560 --> 36:16.552
There's not much joy in life for him.

36:16.720 --> 36:20.759
When I see what Isobel does to Jerry,
it makes me boil.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.231
- Does he have to stand it?
- The weak have great strength...

36:24.440 --> 36:26.795
...when clinging to something decent.

36:27.040 --> 36:30.476
He's been cursed by a passion
not to hurt her.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.155
There must be something.
He married her.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.510
Propinquity and propriety.

36:35.880 --> 36:37.996
Isobel was a high-minded girl...

36:38.200 --> 36:40.874
...who believed that a kiss required
a proposal of marriage.

36:41.480 --> 36:43.756
She's been about his neck ever since.

36:43.960 --> 36:47.919
He struggled at his architecture
to get together enough money.

36:48.560 --> 36:51.712
He had to give it up.
Only thing he ever loved.

36:51.920 --> 36:56.630
She reminded him he was married,
with financial responsibilities.

36:57.280 --> 37:00.033
Almost immediately she had a child.

37:00.240 --> 37:02.993
She considered herself a great martyr.

37:03.200 --> 37:07.398
That's her grasp on him.
Her martyrdom and her jealousy.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.637
She has no reason to be jealous.

37:09.840 --> 37:12.116
Jerry doesn't have flings.

37:12.320 --> 37:15.358
Mostly she's jealous of Tina,
the child she never wanted.

37:15.560 --> 37:17.676
Before Tina, she saw a doctor...

37:17.840 --> 37:20.753
...and tried to get him to say
her health wouldn't permit a child.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.429
Yet, if you could hear her
sanctimonious, maternal tone...

37:23.640 --> 37:26.712
...when she lets it leak out what
a self-sacrificing mother she's been____

37:28.120 --> 37:30.794
- What are you two so thick about?
- We're just being girls together.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.913
We're getting into the harbor.

37:36.440 --> 37:40.354
One of the few sights
that doesn't disappoint you.

37:40.560 --> 37:44.394
- What was Deb saying?
- She was rattling on.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.200
I want to know. About me?

37:48.400 --> 37:51.597
She was telling me
about your life at home.

37:58.080 --> 38:02.358
You mustn't miss this. There's only
one first sailing into Rio harbor.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.678
This is where I get off.

38:04.880 --> 38:08.589
Your boat goes on in three days.
Will I see you?

38:08.800 --> 38:12.077
Not unless you pay more attention
to your guide.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.229
Thank you.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.629
There's Sugar Loaf.

38:18.800 --> 38:21.519
Yes, it is. Sugar Loaf.

38:21.720 --> 38:24.519
The stretch of sand
is Copacabana beach.

38:24.720 --> 38:28.076
Copacabana.
There's music in the word.

38:28.600 --> 38:33.231
There's something for your architect's
heart. The Christus statue.

38:58.960 --> 39:03.318
Serves me right for getting a car
because I liked the driver's face.

39:03.920 --> 39:08.630
- It doesn't matter.
- We promised to meet Deb for dinner.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.036
How much farther is it?

39:11.200 --> 39:14.511
Giuseppe? Giuseppe?

39:14.680 --> 39:16.193
Don't look, just listen.

39:16.400 --> 39:19.279
- How far is it?
- Oh, banana trees.

39:20.080 --> 39:23.198
No. Distance, miles, kilometers.

39:27.480 --> 39:29.835
parakeets, parrots, rubber.

39:32.600 --> 39:33.829
The rubber.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.719
The card said
"English-spoking driver."

39:36.920 --> 39:39.992
He needs
Portuguese-spoking passengers.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.120
Sit back. He knows where he's going.

39:52.320 --> 39:55.915
- Where are we going?
- Must be the shortcut.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.593
Past the old church.

40:04.360 --> 40:08.718
- Are you sure this is the right way?
- I bet he doesn't know.

40:08.880 --> 40:12.396
- I'll make him turn around.
- He'll say, "Banana tree."

40:13.400 --> 40:16.199
<i>- Turn around.
- Okay, senhor.</i>

40:16.400 --> 40:17.834
I told you.

40:22.440 --> 40:26.070
Stop. Turn around. Go back.

40:27.280 --> 40:30.113
- No good?
- Turn around.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.754
Go back.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.637
I think so. Try it anyway.

40:45.680 --> 40:46.795
Stop!

40:48.760 --> 40:52.674
- Take it easy. Go forward.
- Yes, forward.

41:12.560 --> 41:15.074
Mister, please not be dead!

41:15.280 --> 41:17.749
Not be killed!

41:22.080 --> 41:24.720
Please, not be dead!

41:26.000 --> 41:27.832
All right?

41:28.480 --> 41:30.630
- I guess so.
- Sure?

41:36.080 --> 41:38.640
It's all right. Don't cry.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.676
Don't cry, Giuseppe.

41:44.520 --> 41:45.635
I'll try.

41:46.600 --> 41:47.999
Please, mister.

41:59.920 --> 42:02.673
All right. What does he say?

42:02.880 --> 42:05.156
I think he is going to get a horse
and a rope.

42:05.360 --> 42:08.239
<i>No, no. Not cavalo e corda.
Not now.</i>

42:08.400 --> 42:10.789
Get another automobile and chauffeur.

42:10.960 --> 42:12.951
<i>Senhorinha must go Rio immediately.</i>

42:13.160 --> 42:14.958
- Catch big boat.
- Boat?

42:15.120 --> 42:18.078
<i>Giuseppe stay here.
Senhor and senhorinha go Rio.</i>

42:18.280 --> 42:21.079
<i>Get cavalo e corda later.</i>

42:25.080 --> 42:27.515
Haven't you got paper?
Draw it for him.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.872
What's the word for "tonight"?

42:39.080 --> 42:41.310
Draw the face of a clock.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.073
Tonight.

42:44.480 --> 42:45.470
Ah!

42:48.240 --> 42:50.356
Big boat go. Depart.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.391
<i>Goodbye, senhorita e senhor.</i>

43:16.080 --> 43:19.755
We'll either have to bundle
or freeze tonight.

43:19.960 --> 43:24.557
They say bundling is a New England
custom both reverenced and honored.

44:20.760 --> 44:22.751
Thank you. Goodbye.

44:27.960 --> 44:31.954
- The tourist company is sending a car.
- Good.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.515
- The boat waited for two hours.
- Did it?

44:34.720 --> 44:36.677
- Did you wire Deb and Mac?
- Yes.

44:36.880 --> 44:40.760
You can rejoin them in Buenos Aires
tomorrow by plane.

44:42.200 --> 44:45.033
Another plane is going in five days.

44:45.240 --> 44:47.914
You'll get there the same day
as your ship.

44:48.640 --> 44:50.756
You know anybody in Buenos Aires?

44:50.960 --> 44:52.109
No.

44:52.320 --> 44:55.438
Seems a shame to spend
five days there alone.

44:56.200 --> 44:58.874
- You'll be busy.
- My business can wait.

44:59.080 --> 45:03.278
- We did start off on a tour.
- We started off for somewhere.

45:03.760 --> 45:07.674
If I promise to sit
at a different table and say:

45:07.880 --> 45:10.793
"Good morning. Miss Vale.
I hope you slept well."

45:11.640 --> 45:15.679
So people will hear and never guess
I'm head over heels in love with you.

45:19.080 --> 45:22.038
Don't say no, Camille.
Say, "I'll see."

45:23.760 --> 45:24.750
I'll see.

45:42.040 --> 45:44.316
May I have this dance?

45:45.120 --> 45:47.873
- I'm afraid I don't know how.
- Try it.

45:48.040 --> 45:49.838
Just this once.

46:13.800 --> 46:16.519
- How did you get here?
- Along the balcony.

46:16.720 --> 46:20.156
My room is down there.
The whole hotel has gone to bed.

46:20.360 --> 46:23.637
- So must I. It's late.
- Not by your Boston clocks.

46:24.080 --> 46:27.755
It's a little before dinner there.
Please, don't yet.

46:30.160 --> 46:33.391
- I'm not going to struggle with you.
- That's right.

46:33.600 --> 46:37.070
No telling what primitive instincts
you might arouse.

46:38.680 --> 46:40.273
Isn't it beautiful?

46:51.920 --> 46:54.036
Do you believe in immortality?

46:54.720 --> 46:56.119
I don't know.

46:58.040 --> 46:59.269
Do you?

46:59.440 --> 47:01.272
I want to believe happiness...

47:01.480 --> 47:04.233
...can be carried on somewhere.

47:04.720 --> 47:07.280
- Are you so happy, then?
- Close to it.

47:07.760 --> 47:11.196
Getting warmer and warmer,
as we used to say as kids.

47:11.400 --> 47:13.676
"Look out or you'll get burned,"
we used to say.

47:13.880 --> 47:16.918
Are you afraid of getting burned
if you get too close to happiness?

47:17.120 --> 47:20.158
I'm immune to happiness
and therefore to burns.

47:20.360 --> 47:24.399
- You weren't immune on the mountain.
- You call that happiness?

47:24.600 --> 47:27.797
Only a small part.
There are other kinds.

47:28.360 --> 47:29.839
Such as?

47:30.320 --> 47:31.754
Having fun together.

47:32.120 --> 47:34.555
Getting a kick out of
simple little things.

47:34.760 --> 47:36.592
Out of beauty like this.

47:36.800 --> 47:40.350
Sharing confidences you wouldn't share
with anybody else.

47:45.480 --> 47:47.437
Won't you say you are happy too?

47:47.640 --> 47:51.520
Since that night when
you told me about your illness, I--

47:51.720 --> 47:53.711
I can't get you out of my mind.

47:54.040 --> 47:56.077
Or out of my heart either.

47:57.760 --> 47:59.671
If I were free...

47:59.880 --> 48:02.599
...there would be only one thing
I'd do.

48:02.800 --> 48:05.189
Prove you're not
immune to happiness.

48:06.120 --> 48:10.353
Would you want me to prove it?
Tell me you would.

48:10.760 --> 48:12.398
Then I'll go.

48:16.480 --> 48:18.517
My darling, you are crying.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.071
I'm such a fool.

48:24.720 --> 48:27.234
Such an old fool.

48:28.560 --> 48:31.552
These are only tears of gratitude.

48:31.760 --> 48:34.991
An old maid's gratitude
for the crumbs offered.

48:35.200 --> 48:39.592
- Don't talk like that.
- No one called me darling before.

48:44.720 --> 48:46.518
Let me go.

48:50.640 --> 48:53.200
I was lucky.
I got them from a vendor.

48:54.440 --> 48:56.556
They're beautiful. Thank you.

49:25.640 --> 49:27.597
I hate goodbyes.

49:27.800 --> 49:29.677
They don't matter.

49:29.880 --> 49:33.191
- It's what's gone before.
- No, it's what can't go after.

49:34.280 --> 49:36.590
We may see each other sometime.

49:36.880 --> 49:38.439
No, we promised.

49:38.800 --> 49:41.030
We are both to go home.

49:42.640 --> 49:45.996
Will it help you to know
I'll miss you every moment?

49:46.800 --> 49:49.440
So will I, Jerry. So will I.

49:56.360 --> 49:57.839
Goodbye.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.513
Darling____

50:00.040 --> 50:01.519
Jerry.

50:53.840 --> 50:56.354
What am I here for?

50:56.560 --> 50:59.029
Be nice to Charlotte.
It won't hurt you.

50:59.240 --> 51:00.833
- Be nice to Aunt Charlotte.
- Yes.

51:05.400 --> 51:06.834
It's Charlotte!

51:09.360 --> 51:12.239
- Here I am.
- Charlotte!

51:12.400 --> 51:14.516
I didn't see you, Charlotte.

51:18.720 --> 51:21.951
This is Mr. Hunneker.
Two more Vales for you.

51:22.360 --> 51:24.158
How do you do?

51:24.360 --> 51:27.955
Tell me all the news.
Did you have a good trip?

51:28.160 --> 51:29.878
I got your cable.

51:30.040 --> 51:31.394
- Is Mother worse?
- No, no.

51:31.600 --> 51:35.958
- Hamilton Hunneker, polo player?
- Is that a question or accusation?

51:36.160 --> 51:39.790
I have to go. Don't forget
Glen Cove and the boat races.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.435
Be good. Say your prayers, Camille.

51:42.640 --> 51:44.950
- I'll be at the ceremony.
- What ceremony?

51:45.160 --> 51:47.720
There go the Ricketts. Wave goodbye.

51:47.920 --> 51:51.800
- Mother, pinch me.
- I'm too busy pinching myself.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.718
Ham, dear, you better go now.

51:53.920 --> 51:56.434
- I'll see you again soon?
- I hope so.

51:56.640 --> 51:59.109
Anything else I can do?
No, thank you.

52:00.480 --> 52:03.279
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

52:03.440 --> 52:04.919
We better get to customs.

52:05.120 --> 52:09.637
- We thought we'd lost you.
- We wanted to say goodbye.

52:09.840 --> 52:11.751
<i>Don't say goodbye. Just au revoir.</i>

52:11.960 --> 52:14.679
It's a sad time.
I want to tell you one thing.

52:14.880 --> 52:17.156
There was no lady as popular as you.

52:17.360 --> 52:18.634
<i>- Thank you.
- Au revoirf</i>

52:18.800 --> 52:22.509
- Don't forget to write soon.
- I promise. Deb.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.631
- Make a point of it.
- Goodbye.

52:24.840 --> 52:27.753
What is this?
Helios, goodbyes, look-me-ups--

52:27.960 --> 52:31.191
- I wonder where my luggage is.
- There are the Vs.

52:31.400 --> 52:34.438
- Knock me over with a feather.
- Not you, roly-poly.

52:34.640 --> 52:37.519
Where did you get your new figure?

52:37.680 --> 52:40.877
- I met a very clever doctor in Rio.
- Keep quiet.

52:41.040 --> 52:43.077
Johnny, my boy, how are you?

52:43.280 --> 52:45.556
- What's the program?
- Dr. Jaquith.

52:45.760 --> 52:47.751
I cabled him I would be half an hour.

52:47.960 --> 52:50.315
Will you tell him
about your boyfriend?

52:50.520 --> 52:51.590
Which one?

52:53.760 --> 52:54.989
Cigarette?

52:56.720 --> 52:58.552
- Thank you.
- They're cork-tip.

52:58.720 --> 53:01.189
Make sure you get the right end.

53:01.680 --> 53:03.671
Thanks for the instructions.

53:03.880 --> 53:06.759
If I were you, I'd give up.
After Dr. Jaquith?

53:06.960 --> 53:09.520
Back to Boston. I'm flying at 3.

53:09.680 --> 53:11.830
- Back home.
- I'll come with you.

53:12.040 --> 53:13.360
Hello, Jerry.

53:13.800 --> 53:14.915
I'm glad you could meet me.

53:15.120 --> 53:16.838
June is staying in New York.

53:17.040 --> 53:20.795
No, I wouldn't miss
this show for the world.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.674
I'll stand on the corner
and sell tickets.

53:32.720 --> 53:35.280
- Wish me luck.
- Want me to come in?

53:35.480 --> 53:38.393
No, thank you.
Oliver, take Mrs. Vale home.

53:38.600 --> 53:40.989
Bring the bags up later.
See you tonight.

53:41.200 --> 53:42.998
- Good luck.
- Goodbye.

53:48.680 --> 53:50.591
Hello, William.

53:51.440 --> 53:54.558
- Yes, William, it's me.
- Welcome home. Miss Charlotte.

53:54.760 --> 53:57.274
Your mother's waiting upstairs.

53:59.120 --> 54:01.680
- I expect you're Miss Charlotte.
- Yes.

54:01.840 --> 54:04.070
I tried to get down before you rang.

54:04.280 --> 54:07.477
Pickford is my name. Dora.
I'm the nurse.

54:07.640 --> 54:08.994
We'd better not stand here gabbing.

54:09.160 --> 54:11.879
She has ears like a cat and she heard
that bell as sure as preaching.

54:12.040 --> 54:14.190
- What happened to her?
- She's fit as a fiddle.

54:14.400 --> 54:17.040
She has a heart, but she denies it.

54:17.240 --> 54:21.552
At her age, who hasn't?
It'll last years if she's not excited.

54:21.760 --> 54:25.549
- How long has a nurse been necessary?
- It hasn't been.

54:25.760 --> 54:27.831
Mostly she's used us
to fetch and carry.

54:28.040 --> 54:31.829
There were a few others before me.
I lasted a whole month.

54:32.040 --> 54:34.031
She sacked me since you're home.

54:34.240 --> 54:38.313
You better hurry in.
When she waits, she gets mad.

54:38.480 --> 54:40.437
When she gets mad,
then get the smelling salt.

54:40.640 --> 54:42.711
She's all dressed for the party...

54:42.920 --> 54:45.514
...except for her gown.
Just as cute as a little red wagon.

54:46.480 --> 54:50.314
If you need help, I'm above, packing.
See you later.

54:59.200 --> 55:02.556
<i>Remember that
honoring one's parents is a good idea.</i>

55:02.760 --> 55:05.673
<i>You'll be a shock to her.
Soften the blow.</i>

55:05.880 --> 55:07.473
<i>Give her time.</i>

55:07.680 --> 55:10.638
<i>Remember that she's your mother.</i>

55:17.320 --> 55:19.994
Well, Mother. Hello.

55:25.760 --> 55:28.673
You look well.
Lisa said you'd been ill--

55:28.880 --> 55:30.234
Lisa knows nothing about me.

55:30.440 --> 55:32.716
Step where I can see you.

55:36.840 --> 55:38.319
Turn around.

55:43.280 --> 55:44.873
Walk up and down.

55:59.280 --> 56:03.114
It's worse than Lisa led me
to suppose. Much worse.

56:03.760 --> 56:07.799
- If you'd like me to go--
- No, I have things to say to you.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.479
Sit down.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.913
I've asked the family
to dinner tonight at 7:30.

56:16.120 --> 56:18.680
Lisa told me.
It's very nice of you.

56:18.880 --> 56:21.235
There'll be Lloyd and Rosa,
Hillary and Justine...

56:21.440 --> 56:23.238
...Lisa and June, Mr. Livingston...

56:23.440 --> 56:26.159
- ...Uncle Herbert.
- Do you mean Elliot Livingston?

56:26.640 --> 56:28.677
Yes. I'll wear my white lace gown.

56:28.880 --> 56:31.190
Wear your black and white foulard.

56:31.400 --> 56:34.631
- I've lost 25 pounds. It won't fit.
- Yes, it will.

56:34.800 --> 56:38.794
I've had Miss Till here.
Hilda is just Lisa's size.

56:39.120 --> 56:40.713
Your dresses are fitted.

56:40.880 --> 56:43.269
I've asked Miss Till to stay late...

56:43.440 --> 56:46.159
...in case any alterations
are necessary.

56:51.280 --> 56:53.635
You've thought of everything.

56:56.240 --> 56:59.278
There's something else I want to say.

56:59.480 --> 57:01.278
Now you're cured...

57:01.480 --> 57:04.836
...and returned to your duties,
I dismissed the nurse.

57:05.040 --> 57:08.829
I'm used to having a room
occupied on the same floor...

57:09.040 --> 57:11.873
...and with my heart,
it's a wise precaution.

57:12.080 --> 57:14.356
You will occupy your father's room.

57:14.560 --> 57:19.157
William moved your things:
your furniture, books, everything.

57:19.920 --> 57:24.357
But Mother, you had no right
to move my things.

57:24.560 --> 57:26.676
No right to move what I see fit?

57:29.280 --> 57:31.237
I'm not surprised you blush.

57:31.440 --> 57:33.909
I was there when William
took the books...

57:34.120 --> 57:37.670
...and what we found hidden
was a great shock.

57:37.840 --> 57:41.720
I hope that that shameful
episode in your life is past.

57:42.800 --> 57:44.757
If you'll excuse me. Mother.

57:46.120 --> 57:49.829
If you wear your glasses,
you will be less of a shock.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.673
Take off what is on your face.

57:52.360 --> 57:54.431
As to your hair and eyebrows...

57:54.640 --> 57:57.359
...say that after an illness,
one loses one's hair...

57:57.520 --> 58:00.273
...but you're letting yours grow.

58:44.360 --> 58:47.876
- Yes, Hilda. It's me.
- Welcome home. Miss Charlotte.

58:48.080 --> 58:50.640
This came by Air Express
from New York.

58:52.680 --> 58:55.274
Miss Till is here.
Do you want her in?

58:55.440 --> 58:57.670
In a little while.

59:22.160 --> 59:25.551
I'll bring your clothes
as soon as I get a chance.

59:25.760 --> 59:28.229
No, thank you, Hilda.
You needn't bother.

59:33.040 --> 59:34.519
What are you doing in this room?

59:35.440 --> 59:38.478
- I'm going to sleep here.
- You may go.

59:40.400 --> 59:43.597
I wished for someone
on the same floor.

59:44.240 --> 59:47.278
We can get a maid
or get the nurse back.

59:47.480 --> 59:50.916
"We"? So long as I pay the bills,
I run this house.

59:51.120 --> 59:53.396
Please remember you're a guest.

59:53.600 --> 59:56.240
If I am one, then treat me like one.

59:56.400 --> 1:00:00.871
Your guest prefers to sleep
in this room, if you don't mind.

1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:04.158
This is no time for humor. I do mind.

1:00:04.360 --> 1:00:07.432
- Where are the flowers from?
- From New York.

1:00:07.640 --> 1:00:08.755
From who?

1:00:08.920 --> 1:00:12.550
I've forgotten the name of the
florist. It's on the box.

1:00:12.760 --> 1:00:15.400
I had the box brought to me first.

1:00:15.600 --> 1:00:17.238
You know what I mean.

1:00:17.440 --> 1:00:21.877
- What person sent the flowers?
- There wasn't any card.

1:00:22.080 --> 1:00:24.435
You don't intend to tell me.

1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:29.517
I don't want to be
disagreeable or unkind.

1:00:29.680 --> 1:00:32.593
I've come home to live with you.

1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:34.996
But it can't be in the same way.

1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:39.398
I've been living my own life
for a long while now.

1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:43.036
I won't go back
to being treated like a child.

1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:47.313
I don't think I'll do anything
that will displease you...

1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:51.559
...but from now on you must give me
complete freedom.

1:00:51.760 --> 1:00:54.070
Including deciding what I wear...

1:00:54.280 --> 1:00:56.271
...where I sleep, what I read.

1:00:56.480 --> 1:00:58.391
Where did you get that dress?

1:00:58.600 --> 1:01:00.796
Lisa and I bought it in New York.

1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:04.197
Outrageous. Where's
the black and white foulard?

1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:06.994
I gave it to Miss Till.
She was so grateful.

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:11.516
Mother, please be fair
and meet me halfway.

1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:17.350
They said that my recompense
for having a late child...

1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:21.593
...was comfort in my old age,
especially if it was a girl.

1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:26.793
On your first day home after six
months, you behave like this.

1:01:29.400 --> 1:01:31.630
Wait, I'll go down with you.

1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:34.673
Thank you.
I prefer to go down alone.

1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:51.479
Hilda!

1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:53.995
Hilda, come here!

1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:55.793
She fell down the stairs.

1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.958
Go get the doctor down the street.

1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:06.594
Is she conscious?

1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:09.838
If not, this is the darnedest
torn ligament I've seen.

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:11.957
It'll swell. She mustn't walk.

1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:14.231
I'm responsible. We quarreled.

1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:17.990
I believe there are
guests waiting downstairs...

1:02:18.800 --> 1:02:21.679
...or have you discarded
your manners also?

1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:25.953
My family may come to see me,
one or two at a time.

1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:28.509
I think your mother enjoys
the excitement she causes.

1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:32.236
Must you whisper?
Am I to have no attention at all?

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:44.279
Hello, everybody.

1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:50.511
You look simply gorgeous.

1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:52.711
- I love your dress.
- Thank you.

1:02:53.880 --> 1:02:56.076
Hello, Aunt Hester, how are you?

1:02:58.760 --> 1:03:01.195
By Jove, Uncle.

1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:05.354
Rosa, I'm glad to see you.
How you've changed.

1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:08.712
But you haven't, Lloyd,
I'm happy to say.

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:12.435
- Justine.
- I couldn't be more astonished.

1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:17.077
It was a shock. The doctor
said it's only a torn ligament.

1:03:17.320 --> 1:03:20.312
- You did mean Mother?
- Naturally she meant Mother.

1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:22.198
Brother, dear.

1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:25.272
Thank you, William.

1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:27.759
How did it go?

1:03:27.920 --> 1:03:31.311
I don't know, Lisa.
I think I won the first round.

1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:33.989
By the way, do you know
Elliot Livingston?

1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:36.077
How do you do?

1:03:36.280 --> 1:03:37.998
Why haven't we met before?

1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:41.318
The world is small, but Boston is big.

1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:43.796
- You're right, it is.
- Let's have a fire.

1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:47.118
An open fire?
No, Mother won't like it.

1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:50.073
She asked you to come up
by ones and twos.

1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:52.875
Uncle Herbert, you go first,
you're the oldest.

1:03:53.080 --> 1:03:56.391
For as long as I can remember,
that fire's never been lit.

1:03:56.600 --> 1:03:58.910
High time it was then, Lloyd.

1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:01.558
Thank you, would you mind?

1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:16.437
I had no idea you played bridge.

1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:18.950
Are you doing anything Wednesday?

1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:21.515
If Mother would spare you--

1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:24.479
I'd love to, if you think I'd fit in.

1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:27.115
You'd fit in anywhere. Furthermore--

1:04:27.320 --> 1:04:29.596
Please, no more or I shall cry.

1:04:31.080 --> 1:04:34.311
- Good night.
- Good night.

1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:38.838
I'm proud.
Dr. Jaquith would be too.

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:40.911
- Good night, Lisa.
- Good night, dear.

1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:44.917
Can you ever forgive me?

1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:46.918
Never.

1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:52.837
I can't get over
our not having met.

1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:55.111
As a matter of fact, we have.

1:04:55.280 --> 1:04:58.796
- Once and almost twice.
- I'm mystified.

1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:02.476
You were the only boy
who danced with me in school.

1:05:02.680 --> 1:05:07.390
Then you were supposed to usher my
coming-out party and didn't show up.

1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:10.877
- I'm covered with shame.
- I shouldn't have told you.

1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:14.471
I hope you will allow me
to make up for my past rudeness.

1:05:14.680 --> 1:05:17.149
- May I telephone you?
- Of course.

1:05:17.320 --> 1:05:19.118
- Good night.
- Good night.

1:05:21.960 --> 1:05:24.873
- She wants to see you at once.
- I know.

1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:28.351
- Good night. Uncle.
- Thank you for an unusual evening.

1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:33.955
- She wants to see you.
- I know.

1:05:34.160 --> 1:05:35.912
She's had two hours' sleep.

1:05:36.120 --> 1:05:38.873
She sent Hilda to investigate
the fire.

1:05:39.080 --> 1:05:41.117
Let her blow off her steam.

1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:44.870
I put sherry and sleeping powder
in her hot milk.

1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:46.798
I'll wait outside the door.

1:05:46.960 --> 1:05:48.917
I suspect you're a treasure.

1:05:58.160 --> 1:05:59.719
How's your ankle?

1:05:59.920 --> 1:06:02.150
- Extremely painful.
- I'm so sorry.

1:06:02.360 --> 1:06:05.352
I've been thinking
as I've been here in pain...

1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:08.399
...listening to you having
a good time.

1:06:08.880 --> 1:06:12.555
- How much was the dress?
- It was frightfully expensive.

1:06:12.720 --> 1:06:15.599
- Tell you later.
- To whom did you charge it?

1:06:17.160 --> 1:06:19.629
To whom I've always
charged my clothes.

1:06:19.840 --> 1:06:23.913
You expect me to pay for articles
of which I do not approve?

1:06:24.840 --> 1:06:28.879
I could pay for it myself,
I've saved quite a little money.

1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:33.318
- I have about $5000.
- $5000 won't last very long.

1:06:33.680 --> 1:06:36.957
Especially if your allowance
is discontinued.

1:06:41.640 --> 1:06:43.631
I want to ask you something.

1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:46.952
When Father set up the trust
for the boys...

1:06:47.120 --> 1:06:50.511
- ...why didn't he make one for me?
- You were a child.

1:06:50.720 --> 1:06:54.031
He wisely left your affairs
to my better judgment.

1:06:54.480 --> 1:06:56.949
I'm sure you've had
everything you want.

1:06:58.800 --> 1:07:01.553
- I haven't had independence.
- That's it.

1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:05.073
Independence is what I want
to talk about.

1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:08.318
Buy what you choose, wear what
you choose, sleep where you choose.

1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:11.876
Independence.
That's what you mean by it?

1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:14.951
Dr. Jaquith says that...

1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:18.312
...independence is reliance
on one's own judgment.

1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:21.350
I make the decisions here, Charlotte.

1:07:26.760 --> 1:07:30.151
You'll occupy your old room
until I dismiss the nurse.

1:07:30.320 --> 1:07:32.675
She will occupy your father's room...

1:07:32.880 --> 1:07:35.633
...and will perform your duties.

1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:38.673
That'll give you a chance
to think this over.

1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:41.520
I will give a devoted
daughter a home...

1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:43.358
...and pay expenses...

1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:46.029
...but not if she scorns my authority.

1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:51.193
I could earn my own living.
I've often thought about it.

1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:55.155
- I'd make a good waitress--
- You may think that funny.

1:07:55.360 --> 1:07:59.240
You wouldn't laugh
if I did carry out my suggestion.

1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:02.159
I don't think I would.
I'm not afraid.

1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:06.518
I'm not afraid.

1:08:09.720 --> 1:08:11.119
I'm not afraid. Mother.

1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:12.390
Sit down.

1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:16.358
I want you to know something
I've never said.

1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:18.073
It's about my will.

1:08:18.280 --> 1:08:21.238
You'll be the wealthiest member
of the Vale family...

1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:23.073
...if I don't change my mind.

1:08:23.280 --> 1:08:25.669
I advise you to think it over.

1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:29.118
Where's Dora? I want Dora.

1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:34.551
I want my head rubbed...

1:08:34.760 --> 1:08:39.436
...leg re-bandaged, pillows fixed
and another cup of hot toddy.

1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:43.150
- Which first. Queen Elizabeth?
- Head rubbed.

1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:54.150
That's good. Don't stop.

1:08:56.160 --> 1:08:58.310
You're a good girl, Dora.

1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:00.756
A good, devoted girl.

1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:05.509
You wouldn't stick your nose up
at a pot of gold.

1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:07.956
You're talking absolute nonsense.

1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:11.596
Nobody's listening.
Charlotte's gone to bed.

1:09:15.880 --> 1:09:18.315
You're groggy. Granny dear.

1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:23.113
<i>Dear Dr. Jaquith:</i>

1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:25.470
<i>Summer, winter, now spring again.</i>

1:09:25.680 --> 1:09:29.036
<i>Time doesn't fly,
but it doesn't crawl as it used to.</i>

1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:31.635
<i>Mother and I have an armed truce.</i>

1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:33.797
<i>She threatens but doesn't act.</i>

1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:37.675
<i>/ follow your advice:
I stick by my guns but don't fire.</i>

1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:40.555
<i>There's a man
who's been nice to me.</i>

1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:44.873
<i>He proposed. There are no arguments
why I shouldn't marry him.</i>

1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:49.159
<i>Most every woman wants a man,
a home and a child of her own.</i>

1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:51.158
<i>His name is Elliot Livingston.</i>

1:09:51.360 --> 1:09:54.113
<i>He's from a fine family
and is a fine man.</i>

1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:56.550
<i>A widower with two half-grown sons.</i>

1:09:56.760 --> 1:10:00.719
<i>/ don't know why I tell you this
except I tell you everything.</i>

1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:11.356
- I can't force you to tell me.
- They're from Elliot.

1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:13.437
Why haven't you accepted him?

1:10:13.640 --> 1:10:16.553
Do you imagine a Livingston
on every corner?

1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:19.394
I've been waiting to see how you feel.

1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:23.036
It makes no difference to you
how I feel about it.

1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:24.753
You always do as you please.

1:10:26.320 --> 1:10:27.799
You're pleased.

1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:31.755
I'm nothing of the kind.
I'm only astonished that you...

1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:34.275
...should bring a feather to the cap.

1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:38.678
- If you approve. Mother dear--
- Keep that soft talk for Elliot.

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.832
Mother, there's no one like you.

1:10:42.040 --> 1:10:43.110
Come in!

1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:46.072
Your flowers just came.

1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:48.556
- Mr. Livingston's waiting.
- Is he?

1:10:48.760 --> 1:10:52.310
Finish arranging the roses?
Leave them here for Mother.

1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:54.830
Don't wait up. It's a concert.

1:10:55.040 --> 1:10:57.509
I shall wait up. If I want to.

1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:05.517
- Good evening, Charlotte.
- Hello, Elliot.

1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:07.438
We're a little late.

1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:11.275
- You look lovely.
- Thank you. For the roses too.

1:11:13.040 --> 1:11:16.078
Yet you wear camellias.
Why do you always?

1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:19.232
A personal idiosyncrasy.
We're entitled to them.

1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:21.909
You never let me buy them. Why?

1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:26.031
- Aren't you full of questions?
- Aren't you full of mystery?

1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:28.959
- I? Good night, William.
- Good night.

1:11:32.840 --> 1:11:35.992
There are many things about you
I don't understand.

1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:38.430
You put me off and don't say why.

1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:41.598
I don't even know
if you're thinking favorably.

1:11:41.800 --> 1:11:43.552
Favorably, Elliot.

1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:46.149
There are many things to think about.

1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:49.790
Taking over another
woman's house, her sons.

1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:51.513
I'll build you a new one.

1:11:54.320 --> 1:11:57.836
Elaine was a wonderful person.
Do you often think of her?

1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.560
Yes. I want to be honest.

1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:03.949
You needn't be afraid
that she will return.

1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:05.394
She's a memory.

1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:10.310
I'm sure she's much more substantial
than that. You have her sons.

1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:13.478
<i>And I have only a dried corsage...</i>

1:12:13.680 --> 1:12:17.036
<i>...an empty bottle of perfume.
I can't even say his name.</i>

1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:18.913
I want you to know...

1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:21.680
...that I'll be beginning
a new life for you.

1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:25.552
If we have a child,
which of us will it resemble?

1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:29.636
- A child?
- I've shocked you.

1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:32.992
When I marry you,
that'll be a chief reason.

1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:35.953
Well, whatever the reason,
if only you--

1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:38.959
I didn't say "if," Elliot,
I said "when."

1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:42.310
- Have another cocktail.
- I don't mind.

1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:46.436
- Hello.
- Charlotte, darling.

1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:49.353
- I know we're late.
- It's my fault.

1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:51.113
The last, the best.

1:12:51.280 --> 1:12:53.556
Find a cocktail. I'm up on you.

1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:57.549
Let's see, we have old-fashioneds
and martinis. Which?

1:12:57.760 --> 1:13:00.912
- Well, it doesn't really--
- You see a ghost?

1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:07.552
I think I know the man
who's talking to Barbara.

1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:11.913
Durrance. He's doing my job,
architect for the medical center.

1:13:12.120 --> 1:13:14.316
Nice chap.
Not Boston, but all right.

1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:16.391
We've been trying to get him
to dinner all winter.

1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:18.432
Shall I tell him your name?

1:13:18.640 --> 1:13:20.074
- Let him guess.
- All right.

1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:23.437
J.D., here's someone who thinks
she's met you.

1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:27.475
Of course. You do look familiar.

1:13:27.680 --> 1:13:29.353
Don't tell me her name.

1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:32.638
Wait, I've got it.
Beauchamp, isn't it?

1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:35.116
- Camille Beauchamp.
- I'm sorry, J.D.

1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:37.755
- This is not the same lady.
- My name is Vale.

1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:42.272
- I met you on a pleasure cruise.
- I hope you forgive me, I'm sure--

1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:44.756
I shall leave you to make peace.

1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:52.075
George tells me you've been
in Boston often this winter.

1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:55.598
- And I didn't know.
- Yes, several times.

1:13:56.320 --> 1:13:59.676
- You look simply glorious.
- An architect?

1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:02.312
I could cry with pride.

1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:05.677
It's an interesting job
I'm doing for George.

1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:08.309
I wanted horribly to call you up.

1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:10.670
- The medical center, isn't it?
- Yes.

1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:15.431
I walk by your house on Marlborough
Street. Once I almost rang the bell.

1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:17.670
Thank you.

1:14:18.400 --> 1:14:20.118
Tell me about Deb and Mac.

1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:23.551
You introduced me to them
on the pleasure cruise.

1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:25.159
They're both fine.

1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:28.997
How is Tina?

1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:37.319
Well, Tina--

1:14:37.520 --> 1:14:41.195
- I'm having a bad time with Tina.
- Tell me about it.

1:14:41.600 --> 1:14:44.274
I'm afraid we've got to send her away.

1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:48.519
She can't be with her mother.
I took her to see Dr. Jaquith...

1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:52.600
...who was highly recommended
by this Camille Beauchamp.

1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:55.189
Camille, I am still horribly in love.

1:14:56.560 --> 1:15:00.872
We have to dine now
or we'll never get to the concert.

1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:38.999
Camille____

1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:42.311
I must see you.

1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:45.076
May I come to your house tonight?

1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:47.669
I won't stay but 10 minutes.

1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:50.396
I must talk to you.

1:15:50.600 --> 1:15:52.557
Yes, do.

1:16:38.360 --> 1:16:40.715
Hello? Yes.

1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:42.757
What's the name, please?

1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:44.871
- Is that for me?
- Yes, miss.

1:16:45.920 --> 1:16:47.911
<i>- Hello?
Charlotte?</i>

1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:50.754
- Why didn't you-- ?
- I'm leaving tonight.

1:16:51.680 --> 1:16:54.718
- But why?
- I've got to get back on business.

1:16:55.360 --> 1:16:59.274
Mrs. Weston told me.
You're engaged to marry her brother.

1:16:59.440 --> 1:17:01.033
I wanted to tell you.

1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:04.551
I thought he was a grand person.

1:17:04.760 --> 1:17:06.319
I hope you'll be very happy.

1:17:06.520 --> 1:17:08.352
Where are you? I must see you.

1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:11.393
No, Charlotte,
I think it best that we don't.

1:17:11.600 --> 1:17:12.920
Goodbye.

1:17:19.320 --> 1:17:21.880
Hilda? Hilda.

1:17:22.040 --> 1:17:24.236
Call a taxi quickly, will you?

1:17:31.360 --> 1:17:33.033
Jerry.

1:17:33.200 --> 1:17:35.271
Charlotte, you shouldn't have come.

1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:37.909
I wanted to talk about Elliot.

1:17:38.680 --> 1:17:40.910
Why marry him?
Do you love him?

1:17:41.120 --> 1:17:43.555
Not like we do. Not like us.

1:17:43.760 --> 1:17:47.355
I thought it might grow to be
or something like it.

1:17:47.560 --> 1:17:49.597
I thought I was getting over you.

1:17:49.800 --> 1:17:51.677
I didn't think I'd see you again.

1:17:51.880 --> 1:17:53.837
We were living up to our pact.

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:56.560
What sort of man is Livingston?

1:17:56.760 --> 1:17:58.080
Like you in many ways.

1:17:58.280 --> 1:18:01.511
Not your sense of humor,
nor your sense of beauty...

1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:04.433
...nor your sense of play.
But a fine man.

1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:07.598
A kind of refuge
I thought I could never have.

1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:10.357
- You're not angry with me?
- No.

1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:12.551
Only with myself.

1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:14.472
I was a cad to make you care...

1:18:14.680 --> 1:18:18.150
...and then because of some noble sense
of duty, to leave you to get over it.

1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:21.031
There isn't a thing I can do.

1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:24.551
Isobel depends on me more and more.
She's ill and getting worse.

1:18:24.720 --> 1:18:26.393
And there's Tina.

1:18:26.600 --> 1:18:29.877
- If I could chuck everything--
- I wouldn't let you.

1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:33.150
What's the feminine for your word?

1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:37.877
I knew you were married, and I
walked in with my eyes wide open.

1:18:38.080 --> 1:18:41.038
- You said it'd make you happier.
- And it has.

1:18:41.240 --> 1:18:43.436
I've got back my work, due to you.

1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:45.511
I hoped you'd say that.

1:18:45.680 --> 1:18:49.230
I understand Tina more.
I'm kinder to Isobel.

1:18:49.440 --> 1:18:52.080
- So don't blame yourself.
- Then don't you.

1:18:52.280 --> 1:18:53.918
- It's different.
- It's not.

1:18:55.080 --> 1:18:57.549
Shall I tell you what you've given me?

1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:02.437
On that very first day, a bottle
of perfume made me feel important.

1:19:02.640 --> 1:19:04.517
You were my first friend.

1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:08.839
When you fell in love with me,
I was so proud.

1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:12.635
When I came home, I needed
something to make me proud.

1:19:12.840 --> 1:19:17.357
Your camellias arrived and I knew
you were thinking about me.

1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:19.915
I could've walked
into a den of lions.

1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:22.794
As a matter of fact I did,
and the lions didn't hurt me.

1:19:24.480 --> 1:19:26.551
Please take back what you said.

1:19:27.120 --> 1:19:30.317
If you can marry that man
and have a happy life, I will.

1:19:30.480 --> 1:19:31.595
I'll try.

1:19:31.760 --> 1:19:33.114
All aboard!

1:19:38.800 --> 1:19:41.030
I'll look for you around every corner.

1:19:41.240 --> 1:19:42.719
Goodbye, darling.

1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:44.712
Goodbye, darling.

1:19:45.160 --> 1:19:46.673
All aboard!

1:20:13.240 --> 1:20:15.550
Do you know where we'll be
in two weeks?

1:20:15.760 --> 1:20:18.593
We'll be on the ocean
off San Francisco.

1:20:20.240 --> 1:20:22.595
That's so soon, Elliot.

1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:24.632
I do want to be sure.

1:20:28.080 --> 1:20:30.310
You know what I'd like?

1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:35.190
I'd like you to take me to some
Bohemian restaurant for dinner...

1:20:35.400 --> 1:20:39.109
...where we can be very gay,
have cocktails and champagne.

1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:41.669
You could make love to me and____

1:20:46.120 --> 1:20:48.236
Well, what I mean is...

1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:55.234
...if I could get rid of
some of my inhibitions for once...

1:20:55.440 --> 1:20:57.317
...I might have more confidence.

1:20:57.480 --> 1:20:59.118
Time will give you confidence.

1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:03.313
- That's not what I mean.
- What do you mean?

1:21:07.640 --> 1:21:12.077
I read a novel once about a woman...

1:21:12.280 --> 1:21:13.679
...a repressed woman.

1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:17.515
She was in an automobile accident
with a man on a cold night.

1:21:17.720 --> 1:21:19.438
He gave her a drink to keep warm.

1:21:19.600 --> 1:21:24.231
And because of the drink
she lost her inhibitions.

1:21:25.280 --> 1:21:27.430
You see, she was just____

1:21:30.800 --> 1:21:32.871
I'm afraid I sound very depraved.

1:21:39.840 --> 1:21:41.353
- Elliot-
Charlotte-

1:21:43.320 --> 1:21:45.357
Are we both going to say
the same thing?

1:21:45.520 --> 1:21:47.238
About our trip____

1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:50.910
I can exchange the tickets
for three and take the boys.

1:21:51.120 --> 1:21:53.191
- Would you?
- Certainly.

1:21:55.360 --> 1:21:58.159
- I've been thinking about us.
- Yes?

1:21:59.120 --> 1:22:03.114
- Perhaps we wouldn't be happy.
- We wouldn't be, Elliot.

1:22:03.880 --> 1:22:06.872
You should marry one
who enjoys what you enjoy.

1:22:08.680 --> 1:22:11.274
Let's not linger over it, Elliot.

1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:16.714
Well, I suppose
you'll meet somebody, sometime.

1:22:17.200 --> 1:22:19.111
I don't think I'll ever marry.

1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:21.476
Some women aren't
the marrying kind.

1:22:21.680 --> 1:22:23.353
But you'll meet someone.

1:22:23.560 --> 1:22:27.918
Thank you for thinking it was me.
I have that on my record, anyway.

1:22:30.720 --> 1:22:33.678
- Do I kiss you goodbye?
- No, let's not.

1:22:34.280 --> 1:22:36.715
We'll see each other again, won't we?

1:22:36.920 --> 1:22:41.073
Of course we will.
Goodbye till we meet again.

1:22:41.600 --> 1:22:43.671
Goodbye till we meet again.

1:22:54.840 --> 1:22:57.309
<i>It's like the time when my father died.</i>

1:22:57.520 --> 1:23:01.354
<i>His breathing just stopped.
All over, finished.</i>

1:23:01.840 --> 1:23:03.717
<i>Ended forever.</i>

1:23:04.600 --> 1:23:07.319
<i>Fool! Oh, you fool!</i>

1:23:07.520 --> 1:23:10.876
<i>You'll never have a home
or a man of your own...</i>

1:23:11.080 --> 1:23:13.196
<i>...or a child of your own.</i>

1:23:23.560 --> 1:23:25.312
Hello, Mother.

1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:30.394
I thought Elliot was staying.
What's his hurry?

1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:32.712
We've broken our engagement.

1:23:33.280 --> 1:23:37.319
- What did you say?
- We've broken our engagement.

1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:41.354
- Why have you done that?
- Because I don't love him.

1:23:42.080 --> 1:23:45.118
Have you no sense of obligation
to your family?

1:23:45.320 --> 1:23:47.391
You have the chance
to join our name...

1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:50.240
...with one of the finest families
in the city.

1:23:50.440 --> 1:23:52.590
And you say that you're not in love?

1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:54.950
You behave like a romantic girl
of 18.

1:23:55.120 --> 1:23:56.633
I don't doubt it.

1:23:56.840 --> 1:23:58.751
What do you intend to do?

1:23:59.240 --> 1:24:03.154
Get a cat and a parrot and live alone
in single blessedness.

1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:05.431
Stop rocking!

1:24:05.640 --> 1:24:07.950
You've never made me proud...

1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:10.470
...or made yourself proud either.

1:24:10.680 --> 1:24:14.799
You should be ashamed to live
all your life as Charlotte Vale.

1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:16.997
Miss Charlotte Vale.

1:24:17.600 --> 1:24:20.592
Dr. Jaquith says that tyranny
is sometimes...

1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:23.590
...the expression
of the maternal instinct.

1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:26.310
If that's a mother's love,
I want no part of it.

1:24:26.520 --> 1:24:29.512
I didn't want to be born,
you didn't want me!

1:24:29.720 --> 1:24:32.712
It's been a calamity on both sides.

1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:39.955
Mother, let's not quarrel.

1:24:40.400 --> 1:24:43.756
We've been getting along
together so well lately.

1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:45.758
It was a horrid...

1:24:47.400 --> 1:24:49.152
...thing to say.

1:24:54.920 --> 1:24:56.399
Dora.

1:24:57.800 --> 1:24:59.552
Dora!

1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:03.039
We quarreled. I did it.

1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:07.759
I did it.

1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:10.794
I did it.

1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:15.433
To these household servants...

1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:17.916
...who were serving me...

1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:21.431
...I bequeath the sum of $3000.

1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:24.200
All the residue
and remainder of my estate...

1:25:24.400 --> 1:25:25.959
...real, personal or mixed...

1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:29.835
...I give, devise and bequeath
to my beloved daughter Charlotte.

1:25:31.080 --> 1:25:32.991
<i>/ did it. I did it.</i>

1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:39.273
<i>/ never did anything
to make my mother proud.</i>

1:25:39.480 --> 1:25:41.790
<i>/ must see Dr. Jaquith.</i>

1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.310
Oh, Jerry.

1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:49.518
Jerry, where are you now
when I need you so much?

1:26:01.280 --> 1:26:03.351
Hello, Scooter.

1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:07.156
Do you remember me? Do you?

1:26:07.720 --> 1:26:10.951
- Miss Trask?
- Well, look who's here.

1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:13.396
For goodness' sake,
I hardly know you.

1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:16.713
Oh, of course.

1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:20.311
I was about to send the police.
The doctor wired you were coming.

1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:22.670
It's been a very long drive.

1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:25.633
Could I go to my room right away?

1:26:25.840 --> 1:26:28.798
I've put you in room 18.
That's your old room.

1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:31.719
It'll make you feel at home.
How's Jaquith?

1:26:31.920 --> 1:26:34.514
Same. Handing out
common sense instead of sympathy.

1:26:34.720 --> 1:26:37.155
- Now____
- Could Samson get my bags?

1:26:37.360 --> 1:26:39.920
Samson? Get Miss Vale's bags.

1:26:55.920 --> 1:26:57.797
How's it coming?

1:26:58.320 --> 1:26:59.913
All right.

1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:04.836
- What's it supposed to be?
- I don't know.

1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:11.189
Here's the little girl's other slipper.

1:27:12.840 --> 1:27:15.275
Do you mind if I join you?

1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:19.350
What's the title of the picture?

1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:22.231
"The Proposal."

1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:26.954
I'll collect all the pink pieces
if you don't mind.

1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:29.515
Some people prefer
to do a puzzle alone.

1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:33.430
I know who you are.

1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:35.354
You do? Who am I?

1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:39.476
- You're my new nurse.
- No, you're quite wrong.

1:27:39.680 --> 1:27:44.038
You can't fool me.
I know why you've come here.

1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:46.516
To make sure I don't run away again.

1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:49.917
Did you run away once?
I didn't know.

1:27:51.880 --> 1:27:54.872
- What's your name?
- You know my name.

1:27:55.080 --> 1:27:57.071
That's why you stood
and stared at me.

1:27:57.280 --> 1:27:59.749
That was very rude of me.

1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:02.639
But, you see, you reminded me
of somebody.

1:28:03.440 --> 1:28:04.589
Who?

1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:08.555
Well, if you must know, myself.

1:28:09.040 --> 1:28:10.997
Of course at your age.

1:28:11.520 --> 1:28:13.033
You're about 14, aren't you?

1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:15.111
I'm 12...

1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:17.069
...nearly 13.

1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:18.469
There you are.

1:28:18.640 --> 1:28:21.996
Christine, you spend the evening
with the young people.

1:28:22.200 --> 1:28:24.237
- They don't want me.
- Of course they do.

1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:28.234
I bet they'll want you more
if you make a little effort.

1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:30.835
I've got a ping-pong game fixed up.

1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:33.156
Barbara and Betty
against you and Bob.

1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:37.957
- But he's the best player here.
- That's why you're his partner.

1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:41.630
But I'll be the worst one.
I'll die. I'll just die.

1:28:41.840 --> 1:28:43.911
Don't dramatize, Christine.

1:28:44.080 --> 1:28:45.991
Please, please, please.

1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:48.117
Don't make me.

1:28:48.320 --> 1:28:50.152
Don't make me!

1:28:50.360 --> 1:28:51.873
Don't make her.

1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:55.277
The doctor wants Christine
to exercise and--

1:28:55.440 --> 1:28:57.397
I'll see that she has some exercise.

1:28:57.600 --> 1:29:01.992
I have to take my car to the town
to have it washed.

1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:04.071
Christine could go,
we'll walk back.

1:29:04.240 --> 1:29:06.436
Or run if you like.

1:29:06.640 --> 1:29:10.110
If Christine would be kind enough
to go with me.

1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:11.640
Would you?

1:29:20.920 --> 1:29:23.594
- I'm sorry, Christine--
- Please, let me go.

1:29:23.800 --> 1:29:26.269
I promise to drink
all my cocoa tonight.

1:29:26.480 --> 1:29:28.551
For goodness' sake,
don't carry on.

1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:31.674
Get your coat.

1:29:33.720 --> 1:29:35.870
I'm sorry, Trask.

1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:37.593
I couldn't help it.

1:29:37.800 --> 1:29:40.872
I thought you were too tired
to do anything but just crawl into bed.

1:29:41.080 --> 1:29:43.754
Cascades has performed
another miracle.

1:29:43.920 --> 1:29:45.797
Tell her I'll be right down.

1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:49.914
Christine's room is next to yours,
you'll share the bathroom.

1:29:50.120 --> 1:29:53.351
Don't be disturbed by her crying.
Just ignore it.

1:29:53.520 --> 1:29:55.716
One of her tyrannies, like not eating.

1:29:55.880 --> 1:29:57.359
Ignore that too.

1:29:57.520 --> 1:30:00.433
If you could get her to eat,
it would help.

1:30:00.640 --> 1:30:02.313
I'll try.

1:30:12.160 --> 1:30:15.596
- How long have you been at Cascades?
- Ten days.

1:30:15.760 --> 1:30:17.512
Nearly 11.

1:30:17.680 --> 1:30:20.559
- You don't like it much, do you?
- No.

1:30:20.720 --> 1:30:24.395
Neither did I at 10 days.
The first two weeks are the worst.

1:30:24.600 --> 1:30:25.874
I'll never like it.

1:30:26.080 --> 1:30:28.959
- Do you want to go home?
- No.

1:30:29.160 --> 1:30:30.639
Where do you want to go?

1:30:30.840 --> 1:30:33.070
I don't know.

1:30:34.280 --> 1:30:36.590
My mother doesn't want me at home.

1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:39.110
That's why it's helping Father
for me to be here.

1:30:40.240 --> 1:30:42.197
Where were you going
when you ran away?

1:30:42.400 --> 1:30:46.109
For a telephone booth to put in
a reverse call to my daddy.

1:30:46.320 --> 1:30:48.834
- To ask him to come get you?
- No.

1:30:49.720 --> 1:30:52.758
I promised him I'd stay here
for two weeks.

1:30:52.960 --> 1:30:55.873
I just wanted to hear
Daddy's voice again.

1:30:57.560 --> 1:31:00.393
I'm almost sure my father's dying.

1:31:01.240 --> 1:31:02.560
Is he sick?

1:31:02.760 --> 1:31:05.195
They won't let me speak to him,
so I don't know.

1:31:07.920 --> 1:31:09.593
Listen, Christine.

1:31:10.440 --> 1:31:12.716
There's the telephone booth.

1:31:13.120 --> 1:31:15.111
And here's my change purse.

1:31:16.080 --> 1:31:18.390
Do you think he
will be home tonight?

1:31:19.760 --> 1:31:23.276
- You mean I can call him?
- That's exactly what I mean.

1:31:26.240 --> 1:31:29.198
Help me, will you?
I'm not sure I can run it.

1:31:30.960 --> 1:31:32.394
Of course.

1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:43.075
<i>Number, please.
- Long distance, please.</i>

1:31:43.280 --> 1:31:44.793
<i>Long distance.</i>

1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:47.958
I want to put in
a person-to-person call to--

1:31:48.160 --> 1:31:51.391
Jeremiah Duveaux Durrance.
Mount Vernon 2940.

1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:57.158
To Mr. Jeremiah Duveaux Durrance.
Mount Vernon 2940.

1:31:57.320 --> 1:31:59.755
<i>-2940?
- Yes, thank you.</i>

1:31:59.920 --> 1:32:02.309
<i>Deposit 50$, please.</i>

1:32:07.560 --> 1:32:09.233
All of that?

1:32:11.320 --> 1:32:14.597
Hello? Yes?

1:32:16.920 --> 1:32:18.752
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

1:32:21.840 --> 1:32:24.116
Hello? Hello, Daddy.

1:32:24.520 --> 1:32:26.352
Tina.

1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:29.993
- Anything wrong?
- Oh, hello. Daddy.

1:32:30.200 --> 1:32:32.316
Are you all right?

1:32:32.520 --> 1:32:35.353
I just wanted to hear you
speak to me.

1:32:35.560 --> 1:32:37.517
When are you coming to see me?

1:32:37.680 --> 1:32:39.591
I'm so lonesome here.

1:32:40.040 --> 1:32:42.156
Why can't you come tomorrow?

1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:45.236
Daddy, you promised.

1:32:47.120 --> 1:32:49.794
Yes, I remember. Goodbye.

1:32:54.440 --> 1:32:58.320
Thank you for letting me call him.
Thank you!

1:32:58.480 --> 1:33:00.835
I'd like to finish my ice cream now.

1:33:01.040 --> 1:33:04.920
We'd better have some fresh-
Bring us two more vanillas?

1:33:05.120 --> 1:33:08.670
But I'll owe you so much!
Daddy said I'm to pay you back.

1:33:08.840 --> 1:33:10.956
He wanted to know
who was letting me call...

1:33:11.120 --> 1:33:15.159
...and all I could say was a nice lady,
and I'd write him and tell him your name.

1:33:15.360 --> 1:33:19.593
- What is your name, please?
- Don't you think secrets are fun?

1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:23.549
Refer to me as the nice light lady.
It sounds so mysterious.

1:33:24.240 --> 1:33:26.959
I wouldn't tell Miss Trask
about the phone call.

1:33:27.160 --> 1:33:28.389
It might get me in wrong.

1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:33.509
Not Dr. Browns nor Dr. Jaquith.
I won't tell a single living soul.

1:33:34.480 --> 1:33:36.994
I'd soon as die than
put you in the wrong.

1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:38.793
Tina, really?

1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:40.479
You called me Tina.

1:33:41.640 --> 1:33:43.870
Did I? How stupid of me.

1:33:44.080 --> 1:33:46.549
But then it is a nickname
for Christine?

1:33:46.760 --> 1:33:49.229
But nobody calls me that,
except my daddy.

1:33:49.400 --> 1:33:50.754
I won't, then.

1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:54.635
No, please.
I want you to call me Tina.

1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:20.913
It's I, Tina. Don't be afraid.

1:34:21.120 --> 1:34:23.111
What's the matter?

1:34:27.880 --> 1:34:30.474
Oh, Tina.

1:34:33.560 --> 1:34:36.996
Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:40.070
I won't till you're asleep.

1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:43.075
Tell me, what's the matter?

1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:46.955
I'm ugly, and nobody likes me.

1:34:47.160 --> 1:34:50.152
- Tina, you?
- I'm not pretty in the least.

1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:51.879
You know I'm not.

1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:55.277
Whoever wants
that kind of prettiness?

1:34:55.480 --> 1:34:59.519
There's something you can have
if you earn it, a kind of beauty.

1:34:59.760 --> 1:35:01.239
What kind?

1:35:01.440 --> 1:35:04.239
Something that's nothing to do
with your face.

1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:08.234
A light that shines from inside
because you're nice.

1:35:08.440 --> 1:35:10.954
Someday you'll know I'm right.

1:35:11.800 --> 1:35:15.111
- Will they like me then?
- Who are "they"?

1:35:15.320 --> 1:35:16.879
Everybody.

1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:20.795
All the kids. Miss Trask,
and the nurses and the doctors.

1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:24.356
There must be something
awfully wrong with me.

1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:26.471
Do you like them, Tina?

1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:30.190
The kids and Miss Trask
and the nurses and the doctors?

1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:32.914
No, I hate them.

1:35:33.080 --> 1:35:34.479
Shh.

1:35:34.640 --> 1:35:36.870
That's something else to learn.

1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:41.318
If you want people to like you,
you've got to like people.

1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:44.478
That's why Miss Trask
asked you to cooperate...

1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:48.719
...and what Dr. Jaquith means when
he says to play the game.

1:35:50.560 --> 1:35:52.870
I bet you're only fooling me.

1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:55.071
You try it and see.

1:35:55.760 --> 1:35:58.070
In the meantime, if it helps...

1:35:58.280 --> 1:36:00.191
...I like you.

1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:04.075
I think you're very pretty, very sweet.

1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:07.879
All right?

1:36:09.480 --> 1:36:11.118
All right.

1:36:11.760 --> 1:36:13.671
Why are you so good to me?

1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:19.512
Because somebody was good to me once
when I needed somebody.

1:36:19.840 --> 1:36:21.672
Go to sleep.

1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:24.992
Close your eyes
and let your muscles go all limp.

1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:26.958
That's better.

1:36:27.640 --> 1:36:29.517
I'll tell you a story.

1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:34.071
Once upon a time, there was
a little girl who was afraid.

1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:36.510
A little girl, Tina...

1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:40.190
...who was afraid, because
she thought she was alone.

1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:48.638
<i>This is Jerry's child in my arms.</i>

1:36:49.680 --> 1:36:53.389
<i>This is Jerry's child clinging to me.</i>

1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:06.158
Impertinent. Upsetting rules.
Thinks she can run the works.

1:37:10.920 --> 1:37:12.638
Oh, I'm terrible.

1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:15.511
Of course you are. So am I.

1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:17.757
What's the difference? We'll learn.

1:37:18.480 --> 1:37:19.959
I want to talk to you.

1:37:20.160 --> 1:37:21.150
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:23.397
I thought you might.

1:37:24.160 --> 1:37:25.309
Here you go, Tina.

1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:33.840
I hear you're running Cascade now.

1:37:34.040 --> 1:37:35.997
You give orders to my doctors.

1:37:36.200 --> 1:37:39.511
- I didn't, I requested--
- You came to have a breakdown.

1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:42.917
I've decided not to have one,
if it's all right.

1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:46.636
Since you are a member
of my staff, doctor____

1:37:46.840 --> 1:37:49.229
- I've been impertinent.
- Maybe I like it.

1:37:49.440 --> 1:37:53.035
The child is so unhappy.
She's not being treated wisely.

1:37:53.200 --> 1:37:55.669
I was proud of you.
Now I'm ashamed.

1:37:55.880 --> 1:37:58.599
Isn't it wonderful that
you know so much better?

1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:02.395
I have a proposition.
I haven't anything to do.

1:38:02.600 --> 1:38:04.716
Mightn't I be the nurse?

1:38:05.560 --> 1:38:09.155
I promise not to do anything
without asking permission.

1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:11.351
I've already canceled the nurse.

1:38:11.560 --> 1:38:13.995
- Tell me what you'd do.
- Stay with her.

1:38:14.160 --> 1:38:17.357
Pay attention to her.
Make her feel important.

1:38:17.520 --> 1:38:20.876
As soon as you'd said we could,
I'd take her camping.

1:38:21.040 --> 1:38:24.556
- She adores camping.
- Sounds wonderful.

1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:27.997
I couldn't do it without
her parents' permission.

1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:30.317
What would her mother say?

1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:33.996
She'd accept any plan that would take
the child that's been a thorn in her flesh.

1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:36.800
She would protest
if she heard me say so.

1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:39.355
And her father?
What will his attitude be?

1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:42.149
Sympathetic and protective...

1:38:42.360 --> 1:38:44.510
...possibly too protective
for her good.

1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:46.279
Result: Mother's resentment.

1:38:47.280 --> 1:38:51.114
The child's absence became desirable
for all so I brought her here.

1:38:51.320 --> 1:38:54.153
I was recommended to the father
by a friend...

1:38:54.360 --> 1:38:57.193
...but he placed the child
in my care, not in yours.

1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:01.995
I suppose I'd better ask
you something.

1:39:03.360 --> 1:39:06.000
How much do you know
about South America?

1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:09.039
- Well, geographically--
- No, that's not what I mean.

1:39:09.240 --> 1:39:13.029
About my automobile accident
and the man who was with me.

1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:16.597
You said that he led me
from one difficulty into another.

1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:20.314
A patient of mine who
has a phobia about high places...

1:39:20.520 --> 1:39:24.229
...told me about an accident happening
to a man and a woman in Brazil.

1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:26.630
She knew the woman's name only.

1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:28.757
She told me before I could stop her.

1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:33.674
- Who told you the man's?
- Nobody. I don't know his name.

1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:37.157
Then you didn't know that
Tina's father and I met.

1:39:38.040 --> 1:39:39.439
No, I didn't.

1:39:39.640 --> 1:39:42.029
If I had, I wouldn't have suggested
your coming here.

1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:45.995
- I'd no idea you'd met Durrance.
- That alters the situation.

1:39:46.200 --> 1:39:49.431
I know nothing
about your relationship.

1:39:49.640 --> 1:39:52.598
I don't know how emotionally involved
you are.

1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:54.677
I can't work with a child involved.

1:39:54.880 --> 1:39:58.475
I'll tell you. It's over.
That's it in two words.

1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:02.071
Tina needs me as much now
as she did a minute ago.

1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:04.078
I've never been needed before.

1:40:04.840 --> 1:40:07.639
I'm crazy, but if you promise
to behave yourself____

1:40:07.840 --> 1:40:10.229
- I'll tell her.
- But you're on probation.

1:40:10.440 --> 1:40:12.636
Remember what is says
in the Bible: "The Lord giveth...

1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:13.995
...and the Lord taketh away."

1:40:14.200 --> 1:40:15.349
How does it feel to be the Lord?

1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:18.632
Not too wonderful since free will.
Too little power.

1:40:21.360 --> 1:40:23.158
I'm not going to have a nurse.

1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:25.670
I'm just going to have her.

1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:28.039
She'll be my--

1:40:28.560 --> 1:40:31.598
- What are you?
- Your friend.

1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:33.956
She's going to be my friend.

1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:36.879
I can tell you her name,
she said I could.

1:40:37.080 --> 1:40:39.151
It's Miss Vale.

1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:43.354
Not the kind you wear on your face.
But V-A-L-E.

1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:47.076
She's from Boston.
Oh, she's ever so nice.

1:40:47.440 --> 1:40:49.317
What's that. Daddy?

1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:52.876
He said to tell you thank you.
Would you like to talk to him?

1:40:54.800 --> 1:40:56.234
No, thank you.

1:40:57.640 --> 1:41:00.951
She won't talk to you.
I think she's quite shy.

1:41:01.160 --> 1:41:02.514
You know something?

1:41:02.720 --> 1:41:05.678
When the doctor says it's all right,
she'll take me away.

1:41:05.840 --> 1:41:08.559
Camping. Just her and me.

1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:18.791
I think I've got a trout.

1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:20.918
I think I have one too.

1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:53.111
Miss Vale!

1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:55.960
- What's cooking?
- Potatoes. They're cooked.

1:41:56.160 --> 1:41:57.878
They smell good.

1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:00.549
- What have you been doing?
- Writing a letter.

1:42:00.720 --> 1:42:03.599
- Is it a secret?
- Do we have secrets, Tina?

1:42:03.760 --> 1:42:06.149
I was writing a letter to Dr. Jaquith...

1:42:06.320 --> 1:42:08.755
...to see if I could keep you
for a while longer.

1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:10.439
When I go to Boston...

1:42:10.640 --> 1:42:13.792
...I'd like to take you home.
Would you like that?

1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:17.516
Why, I'd love it!
It'll be just like playing house.

1:42:18.200 --> 1:42:19.679
- Here.
- Thank you.

1:42:20.120 --> 1:42:21.997
Oh, Tina.

1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:24.470
I'm so sorry.

1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:29.635
Are you old enough to be my mother?

1:42:29.840 --> 1:42:31.911
Good heavens, of course I am.

1:42:32.520 --> 1:42:34.158
I wish you were.

1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:37.119
No, you don't.
You mustn't think that.

1:42:37.320 --> 1:42:42.190
You don't tell me what to do,
what not to do all the time.

1:42:42.480 --> 1:42:44.630
I don't want to call you Miss Vale.

1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:48.079
It sounds as if we didn't know
each other very well.

1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:50.436
Would you like to call me
some nickname?

1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:52.950
A special name of our own?

1:42:53.160 --> 1:42:55.470
- As if we were chums?
- I'd love it!

1:42:55.640 --> 1:42:57.153
What sort of a name?

1:42:57.360 --> 1:42:59.749
There are many abbreviations
for Charlotte.

1:42:59.960 --> 1:43:03.157
Could call me Carlotta or Charlie...

1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:05.795
...or Auntie or Tantie...

1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:09.956
...or a name I was called once in fun,
Camille...

1:43:10.520 --> 1:43:12.238
...or even Aunt Charlotte.

1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:16.434
I'll call you Camille.
It's kind of a funny name, though.

1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:30.670
Have you been here before?
- No.

1:43:30.880 --> 1:43:33.952
It's gloomy.
I don't know how anyone can live here.

1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:36.436
Tina writes she lives
like a princess.

1:43:36.640 --> 1:43:39.951
It feeds her starved sense
of self-importance.

1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:43.194
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

1:43:44.520 --> 1:43:46.238
Good evening.

1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:51.030
I thought you said "gloom."

1:43:52.040 --> 1:43:53.678
I'm amazed.

1:44:00.560 --> 1:44:02.790
Here, hold this for me.

1:44:06.160 --> 1:44:09.232
Hello. Welcome, Dr. Jaquith.
Remember me?

1:44:09.440 --> 1:44:12.034
Who could forget?
This is Tina's father.

1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:13.395
How do you do?

1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:16.029
- What goes on here?
- We're roasting weenies.

1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:18.311
- Roasting weenies?
- They make swell canapes.

1:44:18.520 --> 1:44:20.511
I'll introduce you
and you can roast too.

1:44:20.680 --> 1:44:22.591
?addyl

1:44:23.480 --> 1:44:25.471
- Daddy!
- Tina.

1:44:25.760 --> 1:44:28.320
Walk down slowly. You'll trip.

1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:35.399
Daddy!

1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:48.036
Can this be Tina?

1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:51.039
Do I look nice?
It's my first party dress.

1:44:52.240 --> 1:44:53.560
You look lovely.

1:44:54.720 --> 1:44:56.279
Do you really like me?

1:45:01.680 --> 1:45:03.114
I love you.

1:45:07.800 --> 1:45:10.918
It would be nice
to show your father your room...

1:45:11.120 --> 1:45:12.713
...and your studio.

1:45:12.880 --> 1:45:17.317
- Would you like to see my room?
- If Miss Vale will pardon us.

1:45:17.520 --> 1:45:19.511
How long will you call her Miss Vale?

1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:23.272
What should I call her?

1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:26.038
I don't know.

1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:30.996
Would it sound too funny if he
called you my name for you, Camille?

1:45:32.080 --> 1:45:34.356
I think it would sound
very nice indeed.

1:45:36.280 --> 1:45:38.237
Don't keep him too long.

1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:41.239
June has some very special
canapes for you.

1:45:54.800 --> 1:45:56.518
Thank you, Lisa.

1:45:56.680 --> 1:45:58.796
- Wonderful.
- What will you call this wing?

1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:00.479
I ought to name it after you...

1:46:00.640 --> 1:46:03.200
...since your time
and money made it possible.

1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:05.996
You're on the board of directors.

1:46:06.200 --> 1:46:08.316
How nice of you.

1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:12.598
I thought that this partition
was to be here.

1:46:16.040 --> 1:46:18.270
What are you looking at. Dr. Owl?

1:46:18.800 --> 1:46:20.234
I'm just wondering.

1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:23.592
Are you the same woman who
hadn't a single interest?

1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:25.515
No.

1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:29.156
I showed him everything.
Now he's in the library.

1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:33.877
Take care of Dr. Jaquith.

1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:35.673
That's a funny thing to tell me.

1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:37.114
How do you take care of a doctor?

1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:38.793
A doctor's supposed
to take care of you.

1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:41.839
- Have a chip.
- Thank you. Dr. Jaquith.

1:46:44.240 --> 1:46:45.913
What are you doing here?

1:46:46.520 --> 1:46:49.797
- I've decided to take Tina home.
- Take her home?

1:46:50.160 --> 1:46:51.195
But-

1:46:57.160 --> 1:46:59.231
But you can't.

1:46:59.400 --> 1:47:01.038
What do you mean?

1:47:01.200 --> 1:47:05.273
Dr. Jaquith says it would be
the worst thing for Tina to go home.

1:47:05.440 --> 1:47:09.070
Surely he's told you we have to wait
until she's physically fit...

1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:11.436
...before we can treat her
like a normal girl.

1:47:11.920 --> 1:47:14.150
I don't care what he says.

1:47:14.320 --> 1:47:18.473
No man would allow your
self-sacrifice to go on indefinitely.

1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:22.315
That's the most conventional,
pretentious, pious speech...

1:47:22.480 --> 1:47:24.073
...I've ever heard.

1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:25.514
I don't know you.

1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:29.310
I can't go on forever
taking from you...

1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:31.352
...and giving nothing, darling.

1:47:32.560 --> 1:47:34.710
Oh, I see.

1:47:35.480 --> 1:47:37.676
Forgive me. It's your pride.

1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:39.592
Let me explain.

1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:41.831
You will be giving.

1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:45.038
But don't you know that to take
is sometimes a way to give?

1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:48.636
The most beautiful way in the world
if two people love each other.

1:47:48.840 --> 1:47:53.232
You're giving me Tina. Every day
I'll be taking and you'll be giving.

1:47:54.160 --> 1:47:56.037
Very kind of you to put it that way.

1:47:56.240 --> 1:47:58.800
Don't you think she's happy here?

1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:00.195
Happy?

1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:03.796
She confessed that she loves you
almost as much as she loves me.

1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.753
What is the reason?
Is it something about us?

1:48:06.960 --> 1:48:09.873
Of course it is about us.
What else could it be?

1:48:19.960 --> 1:48:22.315
I wish you'd tell me what it is.

1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:25.873
Why didn't you marry Livingston?
I'll tell you why.

1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:28.594
Because I came along
and ruined him for you.

1:48:28.800 --> 1:48:32.953
And now my child claims all your
attention and takes your whole life...

1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:36.039
...when you should be finding
some man who'll make you happy.

1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:38.392
Some man who'll make me happy?

1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:43.750
So that's it. So that's it.

1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:46.639
I've certainly made a great mistake.

1:48:46.840 --> 1:48:48.956
Here I have been laboring
under the delusion...

1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:51.714
...that you and I
were so in sympathy, so one...

1:48:51.880 --> 1:48:54.633
...that you'd know
what would make me happy.

1:48:55.120 --> 1:48:58.112
And you come up here
to talk about some man.

1:48:58.320 --> 1:49:02.314
You haven't the slightest conception
of what torture it is to love a man...

1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:06.553
...and to be shut out, barred out,
to be always an outsider.

1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:08.279
- Charlotte, let me--
- When Tina said...

1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:10.795
...she wanted to stay with me...

1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:14.595
...it was like a miracle happening...

1:49:14.800 --> 1:49:16.632
...like having your child.

1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:18.999
A part of you.

1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:22.757
I even allowed myself
to indulge in the fantasy...

1:49:22.960 --> 1:49:26.510
...that both of us loving her, doing
what was best for her together...

1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:29.792
...would make her seem
like our child after a while.

1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.594
I see no such fantasy
has occurred to you.

1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:37.397
I've been just a big sentimental fool.
It's a tendency I have.

1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:40.239
Wait a minute.

1:49:40.920 --> 1:49:43.639
I was afraid you were keeping Tina
out of pity.

1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:46.878
But there was no note of pity
in your ridicule.

1:49:47.280 --> 1:49:50.830
Now I know you still love me.
It won't die, what's between us.

1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:55.796
Do what you will, ignore it,
neglect it, starve it...

1:49:56.200 --> 1:49:58.555
...it's stronger
than both of us together.

1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:01.112
Please let me go.

1:50:01.280 --> 1:50:02.350
Charlotte....

1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:08.116
Please let me go.

1:50:23.920 --> 1:50:26.389
Dr. Jaquith knows about us.

1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:29.831
When he said I could take Tina, he said,
"You're on probation."

1:50:30.720 --> 1:50:32.597
Do you know what that means?

1:50:32.800 --> 1:50:36.156
It means that I'm on probation
because of you and me.

1:50:37.560 --> 1:50:40.712
He allowed this visit as a test...

1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:43.920
...and if I can't stand such tests...

1:50:44.600 --> 1:50:46.318
...I'll lose Tina...

1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:49.116
...and we'll lose each other.

1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:51.834
Please help me.

1:50:56.400 --> 1:50:58.038
Shall we just have a cigarette?

1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:01.759
Yes.

1:51:35.920 --> 1:51:38.036
May I sometimes come here?

1:51:38.600 --> 1:51:42.150
Whenever you like.
It's your home too.

1:51:42.520 --> 1:51:44.875
There are people here who love you.

1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:46.633
Look at you and Tina...

1:51:46.840 --> 1:51:49.434
...share with you peace
and contentment?

1:51:49.640 --> 1:51:50.630
Of course.

1:51:50.840 --> 1:51:53.753
Just think it won't be
for this time only.

1:51:53.960 --> 1:51:56.759
That is, if you'll help me keep
what we have.

1:51:58.200 --> 1:52:00.237
If we both try hard...

1:52:00.720 --> 1:52:04.236
...to protect that strip of territory
that's ours...

1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:08.593
- ...we can talk about your child -
- Our child.

1:52:10.440 --> 1:52:12.511
Thank you.

1:52:12.840 --> 1:52:15.400
And will you be happy, Charlotte?

1:52:15.760 --> 1:52:18.479
Oh, Jerry, don't let's ask
for the moon.

1:52:18.680 --> 1:52:20.956
We have the stars.
