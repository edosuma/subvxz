WEBVTT

00:01.836 --> 00:03.460
<i>- Last year,
a competition was created</i>

00:03.504 --> 00:05.629
<i>to test the nation's
best bladesmiths.</i>

00:05.673 --> 00:08.007
<i>Thousands responded,
and this year,</i>

00:08.050 --> 00:09.925
<i>craftsmen
from all over the country</i>

00:09.969 --> 00:11.802
<i>and all walks of life
have come forward</i>

00:11.846 --> 00:13.971
<i>for their chance
to claim the title.</i>

00:14.015 --> 00:15.556
- I'm gonna be the next
"Forged In Fire" champion.

00:15.599 --> 00:16.807
- I want to win!

00:16.851 --> 00:18.267
- It would be
a life-changing moment.

00:18.310 --> 00:19.977
- Welcome to the Forge.

00:20.021 --> 00:22.312
<i>- Now, the Forge
returns with challenges</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:24.773
<i>unlike anything
ever seen before.</i>

00:24.817 --> 00:26.608
- You'll be using this.

00:26.652 --> 00:30.154
<i>- Skill and ingenuity
will be pushed to the limit.</i>

00:30.197 --> 00:32.157
<i>Some will rise to the challenge.</i>

00:32.199 --> 00:34.616
<i>Some will fall,
but only the best</i>

00:34.660 --> 00:37.286
<i>will be crowned
"Forged In Fire" champions</i>

00:37.329 --> 00:39.580
<i>and take home $10,000.</i>

00:39.623 --> 00:42.624
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

00:42.668 --> 00:49.298
<i>¶ ¶</i>

00:49.341 --> 00:50.507
<i>- My name's Earl Blackmore.</i>

00:50.551 --> 00:51.800
I've been a full-time bladesmith

00:51.844 --> 00:53.804
for the past
four and a half years,

00:53.846 --> 00:56.305
<i>but I've been doing this off
and on for about 18 years.</i>

00:56.348 --> 00:58.307
<i>- My name is Erin Simmons.</i>

00:58.350 --> 01:01.518
<i>I've been making blades
for 30 years now.</i>

01:01.562 --> 01:02.978
Working as a farrier,

01:03.022 --> 01:04.980
we had to learn
to make our own blades

01:05.024 --> 01:06.815
for shoeing horses.

01:06.859 --> 01:07.983
<i>- My name is Scott Thomas.</i>

01:08.027 --> 01:09.318
<i>I am pretty much self-taught.</i>

01:09.361 --> 01:10.986
I learned from
the horseshoeing trade

01:11.030 --> 01:12.362
to how to swing a hammer,

01:12.406 --> 01:14.490
<i>and the rest
of it is just doing.</i>

01:14.533 --> 01:16.075
<i>- My name is Jonathan Wick.</i>

01:16.118 --> 01:18.368
I spent 20 years as a goldsmith.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.538
It's always been a blade
in my hand, a hammer in my hand,

01:21.582 --> 01:23.999
and a fire in front of me.

01:24.043 --> 01:27.669
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to our Forge.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.379
You are here to engage
in three rounds

01:29.423 --> 01:32.341
of competition designed
to test every aspect

01:32.384 --> 01:35.010
of your bladesmithing
capabilities.

01:35.054 --> 01:36.720
After each round,
you will hand your work

01:36.764 --> 01:39.098
over to our panel
of expert judges:

01:39.141 --> 01:42.309
American Bladesmith
Society Master Smith J. Neilson,

01:42.353 --> 01:45.229
historic weapons re-creation
specialist, David Baker,

01:45.272 --> 01:47.022
internationally known
martial artist

01:47.066 --> 01:49.942
and edged weapon specialist,
Doug Marcaida.

01:49.985 --> 01:51.360
They will decide
which of you will be

01:51.403 --> 01:52.861
the "Forged In Fire" champion

01:52.905 --> 01:56.615
and leave here
with a check for $10,000.

01:56.659 --> 01:58.367
I hope you ate
a hearty breakfast,

01:58.410 --> 02:00.702
because today, we're doing
things a little bit differently.

02:00.746 --> 02:03.372
Today, you'll be using this.

02:03.415 --> 02:06.708
<i>[dramatic flourish]</i>

02:06.752 --> 02:08.043
- [laughs]

02:08.087 --> 02:09.962
- Coal forges.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.588
<i>- Oh, great.</i>

02:11.632 --> 02:13.882
<i>Coal forge...
Something I don't do.</i>

02:13.926 --> 02:15.926
My heart is pounding
out of my chest.

02:15.970 --> 02:18.220
<i>I'm gonna have
to really up my game</i>

02:18.264 --> 02:20.722
and pull it out of somewhere.

02:20.766 --> 02:22.474
- In your first round
of competition,

02:22.518 --> 02:26.228
you'll be paying respect
to the history of your craft.

02:26.272 --> 02:29.398
The electricity has been
turned off, gentlemen.

02:29.441 --> 02:32.568
All your shaping,
hammering, cutting,

02:32.611 --> 02:36.363
and welding will be
done by hand.

02:36.407 --> 02:38.240
<i>- My biggest concern
going into this challenge</i>

02:38.284 --> 02:40.951
<i>is how difficult
it is to use no electricity.</i>

02:40.995 --> 02:43.036
It's a lot of manual work.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.747
<i>I hope I can keep strong enough
to get through it.</i>

02:45.791 --> 02:49.168
- On your anvils, you'll find
a round of high carbon steel.

02:49.211 --> 02:52.754
From that, you must forge
a signature blade

02:52.798 --> 02:54.798
of your own design.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.592
The blades themselves must fall
within the following

02:56.635 --> 02:58.302
size parameters:

02:58.345 --> 03:00.929
<i>The length of your blade,
not including the tang,</i>

03:00.973 --> 03:04.099
<i>must be between 9 and 12 inches.</i>

03:04.143 --> 03:05.851
<i>The overall length
of that weapon</i>

03:05.895 --> 03:10.189
<i>must not exceed 22 inches.</i>

03:10.232 --> 03:12.112
Keep in mind that in round two,

03:12.151 --> 03:14.484
you will also have to attach
a handle to that blade,

03:14.528 --> 03:17.362
turning it into
a fully functional weapon.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.781
Your weapons will then be
tested by splitting

03:19.825 --> 03:23.660
<i>a 12-inch nail and slicing
through a sand bag.</i>

03:23.704 --> 03:25.787
Since you will be working
with coal

03:25.831 --> 03:27.456
instead of gas and machinery,

03:27.499 --> 03:30.292
this will be one of the most
difficult challenges

03:30.336 --> 03:32.336
we've ever had in the Forge.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.463
Therefore, you will have
an extra hour

03:34.506 --> 03:36.340
to forge your blades.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.133
Good luck, bladesmiths.

03:38.177 --> 03:40.510
Your time starts now.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.055
<i>[heavy rock music]</i>

03:43.098 --> 03:45.807
- I am so excited for this.
- It's gonna be cool.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.477
- A lot of bladesmiths
have always said,

03:48.520 --> 03:50.187
"I don't even like using
electrical tools,

03:50.231 --> 03:52.147
"because it takes
away from the feel

03:52.191 --> 03:54.650
of your blood, sweat, and tears
you're putting into it."

03:54.693 --> 03:58.195
- Hand crank,
run the coal forge.

03:58.239 --> 04:01.448
If you leave your fire,
it will die out.

04:01.492 --> 04:03.325
<i>If you're standing there,
cranking it,</i>

04:03.369 --> 04:06.203
<i>it'll keep going.</i>

04:06.247 --> 04:08.664
<i>- The uniqueness
of my bladesmithing is the fact</i>

04:08.707 --> 04:11.208
that I use old school stuff.

04:11.252 --> 04:12.668
<i>I love coal.</i>

04:12.711 --> 04:14.503
- Scott actually does

04:14.546 --> 04:17.965
all of his work
from a coal forge.

04:18.008 --> 04:20.509
<i>- Should give him
a little advantage there, then.</i>

04:20.552 --> 04:21.718
- I feel like
I'm powering one of those

04:21.762 --> 04:22.970
World War II telephones.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.013
"Hello, hello."

04:25.057 --> 04:28.183
I'm going to make
an Egyptian khopesh.

04:28.227 --> 04:30.686
<i>It's probably one
of the earliest blades,</i>

04:30.729 --> 04:33.689
<i>and it derived
from the Egyptian ax.</i>

04:33.732 --> 04:36.358
<i>First thing I've got to do
is build my fire properly.</i>

04:36.402 --> 04:38.860
- There's a lot of maintenance
with a coal fire,

04:38.904 --> 04:40.362
as opposed to the gas forges

04:40.406 --> 04:43.448
we normally use...
Just turn them on and go.

04:43.492 --> 04:46.702
- You can't rush
building your forge.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.037
<i>I always say it's like
makin' love to a woman.</i>

04:49.081 --> 04:51.373
Don't rush it.
She'll burn up and be done.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.041
That takes care of it.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.584
If you go too slow,
she'll get cold,

04:54.628 --> 04:56.211
and then won't be able
to do anything for you.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.755
<i>You got to get it just right.</i>

04:58.799 --> 05:01.883
You got to work it up slowly
to get that right heat going,

05:01.927 --> 05:03.343
<i>and once that heat's going,</i>

05:03.387 --> 05:04.720
then you stick your metal
right in there,

05:04.763 --> 05:06.930
and you get going.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.598
[laughs]

05:08.642 --> 05:10.976
- We look like a bunch
of organ grinder's monkeys

05:11.020 --> 05:13.270
out there, just kind
of cranking these wheels.

05:13.314 --> 05:14.896
- Whoo!

05:14.940 --> 05:16.606
- And the great thing
about it too...

05:16.650 --> 05:18.025
You're not gonna
be able to hide anything.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.444
You know, a lot of guys
can rough-forge

05:20.487 --> 05:22.321
and then go to the grinder
and clean everything up.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.822
We're not gonna have that.

05:23.866 --> 05:25.741
<i>¶ ¶</i>

05:25.784 --> 05:28.535
- My major concern
is keeping the metal hot.

05:28.579 --> 05:30.620
<i>It's a hard steel,
very hard to move,</i>

05:30.664 --> 05:32.539
and I know I'm gonna have to get
a lot of heat to this,

05:32.583 --> 05:33.957
and I don't want
it to be too cold

05:34.001 --> 05:35.250
<i>when I start hammering on it.</i>

05:35.294 --> 05:37.627
- Hey, napalm in the morning.

05:37.671 --> 05:41.214
<i>My signature blade
would be the integral blade,</i>

05:41.258 --> 05:44.718
<i>where the guard and the blade
are all one piece.</i>

05:44.762 --> 05:46.094
- I worry about Jonathan
over here,

05:46.138 --> 05:48.555
because Jonathan's got
a gigantic pile.

05:48.599 --> 05:49.599
- Right.
- Might be hard

05:49.641 --> 05:51.975
getting that all cooked out.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.602
<i>- I'm cranking it
and torching it,</i>

05:53.645 --> 05:55.645
<i>and, like, no,
this isn't working.</i>

05:55.689 --> 05:57.731
I know Scott's got some
knowledge that I don't have.

05:57.775 --> 05:59.358
<i>I say,
"Okay. I'm gonna look at Scott,</i>

05:59.401 --> 06:00.984
<i>and I'm gonna
do this the right way."</i>

06:01.028 --> 06:02.694
- Vent it and let the flame pop.

06:02.738 --> 06:03.945
Vent it and let the flame pop.
There you go.

06:03.989 --> 06:05.113
Keep the flame.
There you go.

06:05.157 --> 06:07.449
- Thank you.

06:07.493 --> 06:09.326
<i>¶ ¶</i>

06:09.370 --> 06:11.119
<i>- My particular style
of bladesmithing</i>

06:11.163 --> 06:12.537
<i>is very eclectic.</i>

06:12.581 --> 06:15.290
I really like making
early American stuff.

06:15.334 --> 06:18.293
<i>The general design for the
bowie knife I'm shooting for</i>

06:18.337 --> 06:21.963
<i>is just a real simple,
straightforward clip point.</i>

06:22.007 --> 06:24.132
Nothing fancy, just something
that'll get the job done.

06:24.176 --> 06:27.803
<i>¶ ¶</i>

06:27.846 --> 06:29.763
<i>So I got my fire going.</i>

06:29.807 --> 06:31.098
<i>I'm feeling pretty confident
about it.</i>

06:31.141 --> 06:32.682
It's fire.
How hard can it be?

06:32.726 --> 06:33.934
Everything's going well.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.311
I grab a hold of my steel,

06:36.355 --> 06:39.648
<i>and it's round, and my tongs
keep slipping off of it.</i>

06:39.691 --> 06:41.817
- Whoa, flying metal.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.152
<i>¶ ¶</i>

06:44.196 --> 06:45.862
- [chuckling]

06:45.906 --> 06:47.197
- Yeah, I think I'm gonna set
the record for how many times

06:47.241 --> 06:49.491
my metal hits the floor today.

06:49.535 --> 06:51.701
- It's not
how many times it falls.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.162
It's how many you pick up.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.289
<i>¶ ¶</i>

06:56.333 --> 06:59.835
<i>I do consider myself
a bit of a cowboy.</i>

06:59.878 --> 07:02.504
I wish they could
call you a cowman.

07:02.548 --> 07:06.174
You know, I don't think
I'm a boy anymore.

07:06.218 --> 07:09.678
<i>I'm going to make a bowie knife.</i>

07:09.721 --> 07:13.014
<i>I like it big enough
that you can chop wood,</i>

07:13.058 --> 07:16.685
but small enough
that you can use it to carve.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.061
- I think Erin's doing great.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.730
He's keeping his fire
tight and close.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.441
He's got the... probably
the hottest flame out there.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.734
- Yeah, great.
Great flames going.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.112
- I really
enjoy working in coal.

07:27.156 --> 07:31.199
<i>I learned to work
as a blacksmith in coal first.</i>

07:31.243 --> 07:33.535
<i>It feels part of me.</i>

07:33.579 --> 07:35.871
It's like coming back
to an old friend.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.664
<i>¶ ¶</i>

07:37.708 --> 07:39.166
- Three hours!

07:39.209 --> 07:42.043
Bladesmiths, you have
three hours remaining.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.920
[clanking]

07:43.964 --> 07:46.214
- Killing me.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.591
<i>Man, you feel the burn.</i>

07:47.634 --> 07:48.884
You start to feel it
in your shoulders.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.385
You start to feel it
in your biceps.

07:50.429 --> 07:51.428
<i>You start to feel it
in your wrists.</i>

07:51.472 --> 07:53.263
<i>Your hand starts to cramp up.</i>

07:53.307 --> 07:56.141
But once you get that bugger
down to about 3/4 of an inch,

07:56.185 --> 07:58.560
<i>then it's... you start
moving real fast.</i>

07:58.604 --> 08:00.437
- Look at that technique.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.772
I mean, Scott's on point.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.900
It sounds good, even.

08:04.943 --> 08:09.029
It seems like only half
of that bar is heated up.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.906
- That's pretty much
all you're gonna get right now,

08:10.949 --> 08:13.575
because you only have a certain
amount of heat in that coal,

08:13.619 --> 08:14.910
and you heat up that section,

08:14.953 --> 08:16.912
work it, heat up
another section, work it.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.622
Unlike the gas forges...
Heat the whole blade

08:18.665 --> 08:20.999
and run up and down.

08:21.043 --> 08:23.919
<i>¶ ¶</i>

08:23.962 --> 08:26.588
Honestly, I think Jonathan
is getting tired already.

08:26.632 --> 08:28.465
<i>- This challenge requires
a ton of physical effort.</i>

08:28.509 --> 08:30.800
<i>It's all about pacing yourself.</i>

08:30.844 --> 08:33.595
- No electricity.
No power hammers... none of that.

08:33.639 --> 08:36.097
I'm like,
"Just throw away the pain.

08:36.141 --> 08:37.599
<i>Push yourself."</i>

08:37.643 --> 08:39.601
<i>It's a lot of metal to move.</i>

08:39.645 --> 08:40.810
There's nothing gonna happen

08:40.854 --> 08:42.771
until this turns
into a piece of material

08:42.814 --> 08:45.899
<i>that I can begin
shaping my blade.</i>

08:45.943 --> 08:47.317

Four hammers.

- There it is. Four hammers.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.289
- There we go.

09:01.333 --> 09:04.626
To hear the power
driven by human hands

09:04.670 --> 09:07.295
in absence of
electrical tools... I'm amped up.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.797
I want to jump in there
and pick up something

09:08.840 --> 09:09.798

- Oh, boy.

09:30.988 --> 09:32.696
- He buried it.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.031
He's got to open up
a vent hole in that.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.866
He can crank all day long.
All he's doing is cooking.

09:36.910 --> 09:37.910
- He's gonna smother it.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.536
- Yeah.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.079
If he smothers that fire
right now, he's in trouble.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.099
- I think I may have made
a tactical error.

10:01.143 --> 10:04.436

your hose is not connected.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.854

- He's disconnected.

10:09.735 --> 10:12.694
He's been disconnected

- Push it closer
to the fire pot.

I really do.

Now, look at it.

10:28.754 --> 10:30.253
Now, look at it. There.

the steel reveals itself.</i>

10:56.990 --> 10:58.990
Uh-oh.

10:59.034 --> 11:02.410
I can see a stress fracture
in the steel,

11:02.454 --> 11:05.080
and you fix it by cutting it off

11:05.123 --> 11:06.414
and starting over again.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.625
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

11:08.669 --> 11:12.003
- He just cut off
all his thin material

11:12.047 --> 11:14.839
and left that back end
to work on.

11:14.883 --> 11:17.133
He's back to square one.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.219

to the finish.

11:19.262 --> 11:23.014

make a Scott-shaped blade.

- Not quite sure
where he's going, but...

11:27.646 --> 11:29.270

11:29.314 --> 11:30.605
- Exactly.
- Either that,

11:30.649 --> 11:31.856
or it's gonna be a khopesh.

- Scott knows what he's doing.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.527
<i>- I'm seeing
my profile come together.</i>

11:35.570 --> 11:37.278
I dog-legged it down.
I've got my curve,

11:37.322 --> 11:39.572

more time shaping up the tip,</i>

<i>No point in being

Now, it's time
for you to allow the judges

able to accomplish
without any power tools at all.

14:13.979 --> 14:16.187
Good design.
It does look like a blade.

14:16.231 --> 14:19.107
Get a good grip
on the handle there.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.608
- J, what do you think?

14:20.652 --> 14:22.277
- You got a lot of meat on here,

14:22.320 --> 14:24.153
and I see you got
a little fiery tip

14:24.197 --> 14:25.697
at one point on there.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.282
- I'm not used
to the coal forge.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.784
It was very challenging.

14:29.828 --> 14:33.121
- That's what
we call it... challenge.

<i>that actually stretched
that steel</i>

14:39.921 --> 14:42.463
<i>all the way down
to basically a bar stock</i>

14:42.507 --> 14:44.966
that most smiths
would actually start out with,

14:45.010 --> 14:47.302
and then you started
doing forming.

Very cool.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.638
- It was great
watching you work.

You had a plan.
You chased that plan,

just moved the metal
beautifully.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.312

14:59.524 --> 15:02.317
<i>- Erin, the hammer technique

15:02.360 --> 15:05.570
<i>When you did the heat treat,
that blade color</i>

15:05.614 --> 15:08.865
did not look nearly up to the
red that I would expect.

15:08.909 --> 15:12.535
Are you confident that you have
a fully hardened edge here?

15:12.579 --> 15:15.705
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.332
- I love your design.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.542
It was masterful to watch
you set everything up

15:19.586 --> 15:22.337
before you proceeded,
the way you worked your fire,

15:22.380 --> 15:23.671
and then sharing
that information

15:23.715 --> 15:25.715
with your neighbor next door.

15:25.759 --> 15:30.178
There's a brotherhood in there,
despite competition.

15:30.221 --> 15:33.723
- Earl, please present
your blade to the judges.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.850
<i>- You kept working
through the entire thing.</i>

15:35.894 --> 15:38.394
<i>It was very impressive.
You never gave up.</i>

15:38.438 --> 15:41.189
You never frowned.
You never got upset.

15:41.232 --> 15:43.191
I mean, you just rolled
with all the punches,

15:43.234 --> 15:46.736
so thank you very much
for all that effort.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.822
I'm gonna go ahead
and throw the tape on it.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.784
Now, you started out
with a 5 1/2 inch bar,

15:52.827 --> 15:54.452
and you stretched it out

15:54.496 --> 15:57.705
to a total
of about 8 1/2 inches.

15:57.749 --> 16:00.333
The parameters were
9 to 12 inches.

16:00.377 --> 16:03.252
I would call the blade
on this maybe about 5 inches,

16:03.296 --> 16:07.757
so you're definitely
under the parameters on that.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.885
- Earl, your blade did not
meet the parameters

16:10.929 --> 16:12.470
for this challenge.

16:12.514 --> 16:15.556
You did not make the cut.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.101
Please, surrender your blade.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.769
<i>- I'm disappointed,</i>

16:19.813 --> 16:21.938
<i>but I still had
just a fantastic time.</i>

16:21.982 --> 16:23.564
<i>I feel like I really
learned a lot,</i>

16:23.608 --> 16:25.274
it's an entirely
new experience for me,

round challenge

16:41.960 --> 16:43.418

16:51.678 --> 16:54.137
You will have three hours.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.681
Your finished weapons
will then be tested

16:56.725 --> 16:58.725

they perform splitting

16:58.768 --> 17:01.436

I remind you that
at the end of this,

17:06.818 --> 17:09.444
one of you
must surrender his weapon

17:09.487 --> 17:10.987

27:35.780 --> 27:37.821
It's time to send
one of you home.

27:39.158 --> 27:42.117
The bladesmith

<i>[metal music]</i>

27:46.999 --> 27:49.041
<i>[heavy metal music]</i>

27:49.085 --> 27:51.085
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

27:51.128 --> 27:55.172
- Bladesmiths, this has been
our toughest forge day yet.

27:55.216 --> 27:58.592
The work that you achieved
is commendable.

27:58.636 --> 28:01.929
Unfortunately,
not all of you can move forward.

28:01.972 --> 28:05.599
<i>¶ ¶</i>

28:05.643 --> 28:09.978
Erin, your blade
did not make the cut.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.522
- Erin,
you were a great competitor,

28:11.565 --> 28:13.482
and it was a joy
to watch you work,

28:13.526 --> 28:15.818
but at the end of the day,
it's about the knife.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.445
It's not a hardened blade,
so even though it's got

28:18.489 --> 28:21.782
a sharp edge,
it's obvious it won't hold,

28:21.826 --> 28:23.450
and it deformed on the nail.

28:23.494 --> 28:26.036
So for that, we have
to let you go.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.663
- I understand.

28:27.707 --> 28:31.125
- Erin, please
surrender your weapon.

28:31.168 --> 28:34.670
<i>- Yeah.
I'm almost short of words.</i>

28:34.714 --> 28:37.798
Um...
I can see the reasoning

28:37.842 --> 28:40.759
<i>why mine didn't make
it a little farther,</i>

28:40.803 --> 28:43.387
but I won't throw stones.

28:43.431 --> 28:48.225
I just try to understand
what went on and learn from it.

28:48.269 --> 28:50.185
<i>[somber music]</i>

28:50.229 --> 28:53.981
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

28:54.024 --> 28:55.649
- Gentlemen, congratulations,

28:55.693 --> 28:57.653
you made it
into the final round.

28:57.695 --> 28:59.153
In the first two rounds
of competition,

28:59.196 --> 29:01.488
you came to our forge,
used our tools,

29:01.532 --> 29:03.741
and created a blade
of your own design

29:03.784 --> 29:05.993
in your signature style.

29:06.036 --> 29:08.203
Now, we're sending you back
to your home forges

29:08.247 --> 29:11.123
to recreate an iconic blade
from history.

<i>[dramatic music]</i>

29:14.211 --> 29:16.128

29:16.172 --> 29:18.380
The Scottish claymore.
- [exhales sharply]

29:18.424 --> 29:21.467
<i>- The claymore was used
by Scottish mercenaries</i>

29:21.510 --> 29:24.678
<i>in battle from the 15th
to 17th century.</i>

29:24.722 --> 29:27.806
<i>The weapon,
usually 55 inches in length,</i>

29:27.850 --> 29:29.850
<i>would have to be held
with both hands,</i>

29:29.894 --> 29:32.686
<i>and swordsmen were unable
to carry a shield,</i>

29:32.730 --> 29:35.856
<i>symbolizing fearlessness
on the battlefield.</i>

29:35.900 --> 29:37.691
<i>The clansmen
would swing the sword</i>

29:37.735 --> 29:39.568
<i>in figure-eight movements,</i>

29:39.612 --> 29:42.863
<i>decapitating
and dismembering adversaries.</i>

29:42.907 --> 29:45.699
<i>Legend has it that Scottish
knight William Wallace</i>

29:45.743 --> 29:48.827
<i>used a claymore in the war
for Scottish independence.</i>

29:48.871 --> 29:51.079
<i>This epic weapon
has been immortalized</i>

29:51.123 --> 29:53.207
<i>in the classic movie
"Braveheart."</i>

29:53.250 --> 29:56.877
<i>¶ ¶</i>

29:56.921 --> 30:01.256
The length of the blade must be
between 39 and 47 inches.

30:01.300 --> 30:04.218
It must be an authentic,
working version

30:04.261 --> 30:05.928
of that deadly weapon.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.262
<i>- I'm terrified.</i>

30:07.306 --> 30:09.389
<i>This thing is by far</i>

30:09.433 --> 30:12.059
the biggest blade
that anyone makes.

30:12.102 --> 30:14.186
There's nothing bigger
than a claymore.

30:14.230 --> 30:16.355
- You will have five days
at your home forge

30:16.398 --> 30:18.732
to complete the construction
of this blade.

30:18.776 --> 30:21.401
After five days,
you will return to this forge

30:21.445 --> 30:23.195
and present
your finished claymores

30:23.239 --> 30:24.655
to our panel of judges.

30:24.698 --> 30:26.573
Only after they submit
those blades

30:26.617 --> 30:29.284
to a series of dynamic tests

30:29.328 --> 30:32.579
will they declare one of you
the "Forged In Fire" champion

30:32.623 --> 30:38.043
and the recipient of $10,000.

30:38.087 --> 30:39.503
All right.
Well, good luck, bladesmiths.

30:39.547 --> 30:43.715
We'll see you in five days.

30:43.759 --> 30:46.426
<i>[rock music]</i>

30:46.470 --> 30:47.594
<i>- This is the last challenge,</i>

30:47.638 --> 30:50.597

[laughs]

30:50.641 --> 30:53.767
When it comes to equipment,
I'm more basic.

30:53.811 --> 30:56.311

31:14.540 --> 31:16.957
<i>The plan is get
the blade forged out,</i>

31:17.001 --> 31:19.167

31:19.211 --> 31:20.544
Yeah. That's pretty good.

31:20.588 --> 31:23.797
<i>[rock music]</i>

31:23.841 --> 31:26.633
Crap.

31:26.677 --> 31:28.969

and I'm looking at my drawing,</i>

31:29.013 --> 31:30.888
<i>and I'm realizing I shaped</i>

31:30.931 --> 31:33.473
to the final image
of the drawing.

31:33.517 --> 31:36.810
The problem is... is I had to
forge less than the drawing

31:36.854 --> 31:39.980
so that I could stretch
the blade out to the drawing.

31:40.024 --> 31:42.316
<i>This is gonna cost me
some more time.</i>

31:42.359 --> 31:44.651
<i>I know I'm not gonna get
to the quench today</i>

31:44.695 --> 31:46.987

about that.

31:47.031 --> 31:49.823

31:49.867 --> 31:52.576

Come on.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.369
<i>It feels good to be home.</i>

31:54.413 --> 31:56.830
<i>I have the tools
that I'm accustomed to using,</i>

31:56.874 --> 31:58.665
and they may not be
the best tools...

31:58.709 --> 32:00.459
<i>Easy, old fella.</i>

32:00.502 --> 32:03.003
But they get the job done.

32:03.047 --> 32:06.006
I'm a smith.
We smite things.

32:06.050 --> 32:07.841
<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:07.885 --> 32:09.509
<i>I think the big challenge is
here is making sure</i>

32:09.553 --> 32:11.511
that all the parts
come together.

32:11.555 --> 32:14.640
<i>It's a complex kind of piece.</i>

32:14.683 --> 32:16.516
<i>The guard is crucial.</i>

32:16.560 --> 32:18.060
If the handle's too heavy,
if you go to strike something,

32:18.103 --> 32:19.519
<i>the blade's not gonna
be effective.</i>

32:19.563 --> 32:22.356
<i>It needs to be
in just the right balance.</i>

32:22.399 --> 32:24.107

all this forging by hand.</i>

[howling]

32:27.905 --> 32:29.696

32:29.740 --> 32:31.698
<i>I'm really wrestling
with the guard,</i>

32:31.742 --> 32:33.367
<i>and what I'm seeing coming out</i>

32:33.410 --> 32:35.410
is not where I want it to be.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.454
<i>Maybe I'll look at it tomorrow
and think it's better.</i>

32:37.498 --> 32:39.122
I'm gonna just sleep on it

32:39.166 --> 32:41.041
and see what it looks
like in the morning.

32:41.085 --> 32:44.002
<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:44.046 --> 32:47.047
<i>[tense music]</i>

32:47.091 --> 32:48.548
<i>- So, it's day two,</i>

32:48.592 --> 32:50.050
and if I don't get
it quenched today,

32:50.094 --> 32:52.469
then I'm doing something wrong.

32:52.513 --> 32:55.764
Because of the issue
with the width yesterday,

32:55.808 --> 32:57.641
<i>I'm gonna have to grind
those edges in</i>

32:57.685 --> 33:01.728
<i>before I can quench it,
and grinding isn't my style.</i>

33:01.772 --> 33:03.480
<i>So it's gonna take me
a little bit longer</i>

33:03.524 --> 33:05.732
<i>to grind the edges
in to keep them uniform.</i>

33:05.776 --> 33:06.776
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:06.819 --> 33:08.986
Yes!

33:09.029 --> 33:11.613
Now I'm gonna have to mess
around with that gas forge,

33:11.657 --> 33:14.908
get it dialed in
for the quenching.

33:14.952 --> 33:17.619
<i>I don't use the gas forge often.</i>

33:17.663 --> 33:21.164

Here goes nothing.

Up and in.

33:38.976 --> 33:40.434
I'm gonna pull this thing out.

33:40.477 --> 33:44.021
It's probably
gonna burst into flames. Or not.

33:44.064 --> 33:47.065
The heat treatment went well.
It didn't break.

33:47.109 --> 33:50.110
<i>[rock music]</i>

33:50.154 --> 33:51.695

I didn't like the guard,</i>

but as we know, looks
are secondary to performance,

37:03.347 --> 37:05.889
and that... we're about
to put your weapons

37:05.933 --> 37:08.141
through a series of tests.

37:08.185 --> 37:09.476
Doug.

37:09.519 --> 37:11.144
<i>[tense music]</i>

37:11.188 --> 37:13.313
- Bladesmiths,
this is the kill test.

37:13.357 --> 37:17.150
The term claymore in Gaelic
means great sword.

37:17.194 --> 37:19.486
To see how lethal your weapon is

37:19.529 --> 37:20.904
and to test its functionality

37:20.948 --> 37:22.489
according to its historic
design,

37:22.532 --> 37:24.991
I will deliver two killing blows
on this animal carcass.

37:25.035 --> 37:26.159
<i>¶ ¶</i>

37:26.203 --> 37:28.411
Scott, you're up.
You ready?

37:28.455 --> 37:30.664
- I'm ready.
Let's do it.

37:30.707 --> 37:32.499
<i>I see the pigs,
and I'm thinking,</i>

37:32.542 --> 37:34.167
"Aw, crap."

37:34.211 --> 37:36.044
<i>I've cut test against pigs,</i>

37:36.088 --> 37:38.296
<i>and they don't cut
very easily at all.</i>

37:38.340 --> 37:41.341
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

37:41.385 --> 37:43.843
<i>¶ ¶</i>

37:43.887 --> 37:46.763
Oh, [bleep].

37:46.807 --> 37:50.517
The moment Doug hits the pig
and I hear that thud,

37:50.560 --> 37:52.227
<i>I'm like, "Crap."</i>

37:52.271 --> 37:53.853
- Uh, Scott, we have
a little problem here.

37:53.897 --> 37:55.355
- [laughs]

37:55.399 --> 37:56.856
- The hardness of your blade

37:56.900 --> 37:59.693
is a little bit
on the, uh, flexible side.

37:59.736 --> 38:02.696
It did not even cut the carcass,

38:02.739 --> 38:04.948
so that brings into
question also

38:04.992 --> 38:08.201
the sharpness of your edge.

38:08.245 --> 38:09.494
I'm thinking
we're pretty much done.

38:09.538 --> 38:10.538
[laughs]

38:10.580 --> 38:14.374
<i>¶ ¶</i>

38:14.418 --> 38:16.710
- It will not kill.

38:16.753 --> 38:18.878
<i>¶ ¶</i>

38:18.922 --> 38:20.755
- This is a failure.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.590
- Jonathan, you're up.
Are you ready?

38:22.634 --> 38:23.717
- Absolutely.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.719
<i>¶ ¶</i>

38:25.762 --> 38:27.721
I am confident that
I made a good blade.

38:27.764 --> 38:30.557
<i>The blade is hard,
and it's ready to cut.</i>

38:30.600 --> 38:32.475
<i>This is gonna be spectacular.</i>

38:32.519 --> 38:35.478
<i>[rock music]</i>

38:35.522 --> 38:42.819

[bleep]

38:48.994 --> 38:51.077
<i>[heavy metal music]</i>

38:51.121 --> 38:54.581

38:54.624 --> 38:57.584
<i>The blade is hard,
and it's ready to cut.</i>

38:57.627 --> 38:59.252
<i>This is gonna be spectacular.</i>

Oh, boy.

39:15.645 --> 39:22.150
<i>¶ ¶</i>

39:22.194 --> 39:25.111
- Jonathan, we have
a major blade malfunction.

39:25.155 --> 39:26.863
It did initially cut through,

39:26.907 --> 39:29.074
but then it probably
hit the spine.

39:29.117 --> 39:30.283
It just exploded.

39:30.327 --> 39:32.660
<i>¶ ¶</i>

39:32.704 --> 39:34.120
<i>- I'm not completely confident</i>

39:34.164 --> 39:35.622
that I'm gonna come out
with a win here,

39:35.665 --> 39:37.499
<i>but my blade cuts,</i>

39:37.542 --> 39:40.251
and that's more than Scott's.

39:40.295 --> 39:43.463
- Jonathan, your blade
suffered catastrophic failure.

39:43.507 --> 39:45.340
For safety reasons,
we can no longer

39:45.384 --> 39:47.384
continue testing on your blade.

39:47.427 --> 39:51.054
<i>Since both weapons
have suffered malfunctions,</i>

39:51.098 --> 39:53.598
<i>Dave will now decide
on the best course of action</i>

39:53.642 --> 39:56.142
<i>to move forward
with the competition.</i>

39:56.186 --> 39:58.144
- Dave?

39:58.188 --> 39:59.479
<i>¶ ¶</i>

39:59.523 --> 40:01.815
- In "The Viking Sagas,"
swords broke.

40:01.858 --> 40:03.983
In "The Song of Roland,"
swords broke,

40:04.027 --> 40:07.237
but bent swords
can be straightened.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.406
So we'd like to give you
an opportunity, Scott,

40:09.449 --> 40:10.990
to straighten that weapon

40:11.034 --> 40:12.992
so we can take it forward
into a sharpness test

40:13.036 --> 40:15.870
to help us determine our winner.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.330
So Scott, why don't you
take a moment

40:17.374 --> 40:19.165
and straighten your weapon.
- Okay.

40:19.209 --> 40:26.673
<i>¶ ¶</i>

40:26.716 --> 40:28.174
- That's as straight
as it's gonna get.

40:28.218 --> 40:31.678
<i>¶ ¶</i>

40:31.721 --> 40:35.140
- Now, not only was the claymore
a battlefield intimidator,

40:35.183 --> 40:36.516
but it was also
a Scottish symbol

40:36.560 --> 40:38.685
for physical prowess
and strength.

40:38.728 --> 40:40.770
So what I'm gonna do to test
the edge of your blade

40:40.814 --> 40:44.357
is I'm going to cut
into this piece of sheet steel.

40:44.401 --> 40:47.527
So Scott, are you ready?
- Let's do it.

40:47.571 --> 40:52.532
<i>¶ ¶</i>

40:52.576 --> 40:54.826
<i>I've got a 50/50 shot
that it's gonna do well.</i>

40:54.870 --> 40:56.453
You know, I just want
to see what happens.

40:56.496 --> 41:01.458
<i>¶ ¶</i>

41:01.501 --> 41:03.334
<i>- I am desperate to win.</i>

41:03.378 --> 41:05.545
I mean, this is $10,000
on the line, here.

41:05.589 --> 41:08.548
<i>¶ ¶</i>

41:08.592 --> 41:09.883
- I don't even want to watch.

41:09.926 --> 41:16.055

<i>¶ ¶</i>

41:24.107 --> 41:26.357
- Well, Scott,

41:26.401 --> 41:28.443
there's actually still
an edge here.

41:28.487 --> 41:30.111
We can see what it did
to the steel.

41:30.155 --> 41:31.571
- Should've had the pig
made out of steel.

41:31.615 --> 41:34.574
It probably would've cut better.
[laughter]

41:34.618 --> 41:36.701
- All in all, well done.
- Thank you.

41:36.745 --> 41:38.244
<i>Overall, I'm pleased.</i>

41:38.288 --> 41:40.246
This was the first time
I've ever made a blade

41:40.290 --> 41:42.250
of this size,
of this complexity.

41:42.292 --> 41:45.418
<i>¶ ¶</i>

41:45.462 --> 41:47.212
- Gentlemen, this, by far,

41:47.255 --> 41:49.923
was our most
difficult challenge to date.

41:49.966 --> 41:51.299
Congratulations,

41:51.343 --> 41:54.427
you both delivered
your Scottish claymores,

41:54.471 --> 41:56.596
but there can only be
one champion.

41:56.640 --> 41:59.557
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

41:59.601 --> 42:01.434
Scott...

42:01.478 --> 42:04.145
congratulations, you are
the "Forged In Fire" champion.

42:04.189 --> 42:06.689
- Thank you.

42:06.733 --> 42:07.815
Hey, man.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.609
Good going.
Yeah, thanks.

42:09.653 --> 42:13.112
- Jonathan, unfortunately,
your blade did not make the cut.

42:13.156 --> 42:15.448
- Jonathan,
the design of your blade

42:15.492 --> 42:17.367
was really going
in the right direction.

42:17.410 --> 42:19.202
Basically,
once that blade snapped,

42:19.246 --> 42:21.496
there just wasn't anything else
we could do to test that blade.

42:21.540 --> 42:23.373
So that's why we're
letting you go.

42:23.416 --> 42:27.293
- Jonathan, please
surrender your weapon.

42:27.337 --> 42:28.836
- It was a great pleasure, man.
- Thank you, sir.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.339
I'll be back.

42:31.383 --> 42:33.132
<i>Absolutely proud of myself.</i>

42:33.176 --> 42:35.760
<i>With every failure, there is
a great lesson learned,</i>

42:35.804 --> 42:38.429
and I think
I'm moving forward from here.

42:38.473 --> 42:39.806
- Scott, congratulations,

42:39.849 --> 42:41.349
you are the
"Forged In Fire" champion,

42:41.393 --> 42:44.644
and you'll be receiving
a check for $10,000.

42:44.688 --> 42:46.145
Good job.

42:46.189 --> 42:47.814

42:47.857 --> 42:49.315

42:49.359 --> 42:51.159
This is the first time
I've ever won anything.

42:51.194 --> 42:53.570
<i>You try your best,
and you learn from it,</i>

42:53.613 --> 42:56.197
and then you do it again
until you perfect it,

42:56.241 --> 42:58.157
<i>and even though the sword
didn't do what I wanted,</i>

42:58.201 --> 43:00.994
<i>it's still okay... I won.</i>
