02:50.878 --> 02:51.845
Is this such a good idea?

02:53.214 --> 02:56.274
Is marriage a good idea?
Because marriage is huge.

02:56.484 --> 02:59.544
I am having troubIe breathing.

02:59.754 --> 03:01.745
I am having troubIe catching my breath.

03:01.989 --> 03:04.890
-WouId you reIax?
-How couId I possibIy reIax!?

03:05.093 --> 03:06.583
Because it's my wedding.

03:06.828 --> 03:08.853
That's Max. Only 19 years old...

03:09.063 --> 03:12.658
...and is getting married to
the only girl he's everhad sex with.

03:15.837 --> 03:18.738
That day l promised myself,
l'd stay single forever.

03:19.207 --> 03:20.231
Gimshins.

03:20.675 --> 03:22.336
Granted, Kimberly was gorgeous.

03:22.543 --> 03:25.535
-What's the hoIdup?
-Your groom isn't quite out yet.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.840
WeII, fix it, Daddy!

03:28.282 --> 03:31.251
l guess Max didn't see her
quite the way l did.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.610
Make him behave!

03:32.854 --> 03:34.651
It wiII be perfect. I promise.

03:34.856 --> 03:38.519
Kimberly's fatherhelped invent
a very special pill.

03:40.528 --> 03:44.157
Now, Viagra beat him to the market,
but his pill wasjust as good.

03:44.365 --> 03:46.060
lt could turn this...

03:46.267 --> 03:47.962
...into this.

03:50.204 --> 03:52.263
There's enough to give
an eIephant a boner.

03:52.473 --> 03:55.931
You are so bad.
Your own sister's wedding?

03:56.778 --> 03:58.803
PIease. She's gonna Iove it.

03:59.046 --> 04:02.482
I'II put it on the gift tabIe.
They'II take it on the honeymoon.

04:03.050 --> 04:04.984
He'II have a three-day boner.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.314
I Iove the smeII of bridesmaids
in the morning.

04:10.825 --> 04:15.319
My best friend, Kyle.
lf this is youraverage brain...

04:15.730 --> 04:18.459
...this is Kyle's brain.

04:19.100 --> 04:22.934
Anyway, the wedding was about to get
especially hard.

04:23.938 --> 04:27.066
I propose a toast. Ah, yes. To Max!

04:27.975 --> 04:30.136
First tomcat to take the pIunge.

04:30.344 --> 04:31.606
Thanks, guys.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.043
May it never happen to us!

04:37.451 --> 04:38.816
There you go, buddy.

04:47.361 --> 04:48.692
Dude.

04:50.932 --> 04:52.126
Dude.

04:55.870 --> 04:57.098
Dude.

04:58.272 --> 05:01.537
This is the best wine ever.

05:02.343 --> 05:05.141
What the heII is going on?
Everybody's waiting out there.

05:06.147 --> 05:08.138
What is up with you?

05:11.819 --> 05:13.548
HoIy Mary...

05:13.788 --> 05:15.380
...Mother of God.

05:15.723 --> 05:18.214
You boys must reaIIy Iike weddings.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.059
Get out there. Everybody's waiting.

05:46.254 --> 05:47.721
Don't move.

05:49.590 --> 05:51.251
Here we go, here we go.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.009
You may aII be seated.

06:17.184 --> 06:18.708
-Turn around.
-We can't.

06:18.920 --> 06:19.944
Here we go.

06:34.969 --> 06:38.530
Don't they Iook handsome
in their tuxedos?

06:39.273 --> 06:42.106
I cannot beIieve that Max actuaIIy
went through with it.

06:42.310 --> 06:43.937
It's a goddamn shame.

06:44.211 --> 06:48.944
I am hereby dedicating myseIf to
a Iife as a professionaI tomcat.

06:49.150 --> 06:51.448
ProfessionaI tomcat, right on.

06:51.652 --> 06:53.620
Yeah, man. Forget marriage.

06:53.821 --> 06:55.618
I'II naiI every woman
on the pIanet.

06:55.823 --> 06:56.790
Every one?

06:56.991 --> 06:58.253
Except my mother and grandmother.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.723
First of aII, your mom is hot.

07:01.228 --> 07:03.526
SecondIy, you reaIize there are...

07:03.731 --> 07:05.790
...two and a haIf biIIion femaIes
on Earth.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.333
-Are you saying it can't be done?
-No. But we got to divide them up.

07:10.271 --> 07:11.238
DeaI.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.702
I'II never get married. Ever.

07:13.908 --> 07:16.843
You're aImost married as it is.
KeIIy runs your Iife.

07:17.078 --> 07:19.478
She does not!

07:19.914 --> 07:21.176
You've got five minutes.

07:21.415 --> 07:22.347
Thank you.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.348
You'II be the next to go.

07:27.555 --> 07:29.819
PIease. We aII know who'II be next.

07:30.024 --> 07:31.651
Steve dog!

07:33.861 --> 07:36.227
I don't even have a girIfriend.

07:36.430 --> 07:37.954
You're going down, buddy.

07:38.165 --> 07:39.496
What? Why?

07:40.101 --> 07:44.037
Because, Iike Max, the first girI that
Iets you get with her, you'II marry.

07:44.238 --> 07:45.227
You want to bet?

07:45.439 --> 07:47.634
ActuaIIy bet? ReaIIy bet for money?

07:47.842 --> 07:51.175
Yeah. Let's say the Iast singIe man
gets a thousand bucks...

07:51.379 --> 07:54.280
...from the rest of you who end up
getting married.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.445
Six grand's a Iot of money.

07:57.385 --> 08:01.185
No, no. If we're going to do this,
we do it right. Okay?

08:01.389 --> 08:04.586
Each of us puts two hundred doIIars
a year away in savings.

08:04.792 --> 08:07.852
No, no, no. High-yieId mutuaI fund.

08:08.062 --> 08:11.554
AII right, the Iast man standing at
the end, gets the whoIe pot.

08:11.799 --> 08:13.596
I'm taIking 1 0, 20 grand!

08:13.801 --> 08:14.893
That's a Iot of money.

08:15.136 --> 08:17.866
Yeah. And you're out if you go gay,
Gary.

08:18.072 --> 08:19.130
Hey, bIow me.

08:24.078 --> 08:25.204
AII right, Gary's out.

08:25.746 --> 08:28.772
I'm in. Tomcats' bet.
Let's get in here.

08:28.983 --> 08:30.541
Come on, get in here!

08:30.751 --> 08:33.184
I'm going to invest some money, okay?

08:33.386 --> 08:35.321
Tomcats! Tomcats!

08:41.595 --> 08:45.224
You guys are going to pay me so bad!

08:46.267 --> 08:49.498
I don't ever want to get married.
I don't!

08:49.737 --> 08:50.931
I do.

08:52.773 --> 08:53.705
By the power vested in me...

08:55.076 --> 08:59.103
...by AIIah and the state of
Nevada...

08:59.780 --> 09:01.611
...I now pronounce you...

09:01.849 --> 09:04.215
...husband and...

09:07.688 --> 09:10.680
...wife, my friends.

09:11.025 --> 09:12.356
Okay, Iove her tender.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.425
Love her tenders. PIease.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.427
Rock the jaiIhouse.

09:19.233 --> 09:22.396
Every singIe woman, come to the center
of the aisIe...

09:22.603 --> 09:24.969
...so you can catch the fIower
bouquets....

09:25.206 --> 09:27.265
-AII the singIe Iadies.
-Where are you going?

09:27.475 --> 09:28.772
-Let's go, pIease.
-Sit down.

09:29.043 --> 09:30.943
Thank you very much.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.852
You went down, my man!
Down Iike a 2-doIIar hooker!

09:44.058 --> 09:45.821
Boom! You're out! You suck!

09:46.060 --> 09:47.493
Tricia's great, though.

09:47.728 --> 09:50.959
No, I'II teII you who's great.
Jan here is great.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.466
What's our bacheIor pooI up to now?

09:55.669 --> 09:58.832
As of Friday, about 475.

09:59.073 --> 10:01.268
Man, that's haIf a miIIion bucks!

10:02.009 --> 10:06.105
Can our man Jan pick IPOs or what?
I'm wet. I'm, Iike, wet.

10:06.347 --> 10:09.145
Don't you sometimes wish you
couId fuck money?

10:09.917 --> 10:12.613
Weddings bring out
the romantic in you, KyIe.

10:12.853 --> 10:15.083
KyIe, don't you have enough money
aIready?

10:15.422 --> 10:19.324
You can never have enough money.
And you're a fag for saying that.

10:19.527 --> 10:21.995
-No offense, Gary.
-Hey, bIow me.

10:24.098 --> 10:26.589
Looks Iike it's just you and me now,
buddy.

10:26.800 --> 10:30.167
And I'm not the one bringing chicks
who catch bouquets.

10:36.944 --> 10:39.139
I can't beIieve we're
doing this again.

10:39.346 --> 10:40.870
How many times can we do it?

10:41.115 --> 10:43.606
-You're going down.
-You're unquenchabIe. I'II pass out.

10:43.817 --> 10:47.617
Here it comes. Here it comes.

10:57.331 --> 10:58.889
You Iose.

10:59.166 --> 11:01.896
-Take off your pants.
-Oh, no. I Iose again!

11:02.136 --> 11:04.900
Oh, God, I hate Iosing.

11:05.172 --> 11:07.163
Hurry, before he says it again.

11:07.374 --> 11:12.038
No, no, no. No more drinking.
No more drinking. You win.

11:12.246 --> 11:13.713
You win.

11:13.914 --> 11:16.439
I win? Oh, yeah?

11:16.650 --> 11:18.982
WeII, good. Then I'm coIIecting.

11:22.523 --> 11:25.583
Come on. I want to be dangerous.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.053
Where we going?

11:27.294 --> 11:28.522
Where are we going?

11:38.706 --> 11:40.401
Say it, MichaeI.

11:41.609 --> 11:42.598
Say it?

11:43.077 --> 11:45.204
I won't do it unIess you say it.

11:45.679 --> 11:49.046
I'm sorry. I'm having a IittIe bit of
troubIe concentrating here.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.115
What is it exactIy you want me to say?

11:51.852 --> 11:53.012
You know.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.179
Those three...

11:55.689 --> 11:56.883
...IittIe...

11:57.691 --> 11:58.749
...words.

11:58.959 --> 12:00.256
Those three IittIe words.

12:01.428 --> 12:03.862
Those three IittIe words.

12:07.735 --> 12:09.396
HoId on a minute.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.070
What? What's wrong?

12:12.773 --> 12:16.038
I'm sorry. I'm going to have to
ask you to Ieave.

12:16.310 --> 12:18.175
Why are you acting Iike this?

12:18.379 --> 12:21.746
-You are the one who's rushing things.
-Rushing what?

12:21.949 --> 12:24.281
SheIby, I Iike you. I Iike you a Iot.

12:24.485 --> 12:27.420
But things are just moving
a IittIe too fast.

12:28.455 --> 12:31.982
I'm just not ready to say,
''I Iove you.''

12:32.493 --> 12:35.155
What makes you think I
want you to say, ''I Iove you''?

12:35.396 --> 12:38.058
Oh, come on. Back there.

12:38.265 --> 12:41.666
You wouIdn't do it because I wouIdn't
say those three IittIe words.

12:43.937 --> 12:46.235
You coIossaI moron.

12:47.174 --> 12:51.304
''Suck...my...cock.''

12:53.580 --> 12:57.448
Suck my cock. Suck my cock!

12:57.685 --> 13:01.917
Oh, suck my cock! Suck my cock!
Suck my cock! Suck my cock.

13:06.093 --> 13:11.087
That was great. You put your shoes
out on the piIIow Iike this. Great.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.666
-Sorry.
-Jerk.

13:15.869 --> 13:17.427
I'II catch you Iater.

13:21.875 --> 13:24.036
What's going on? Who you Iooking for?

13:24.278 --> 13:26.974
SheIby. She's probabIy haIfway back
to L.A. by now.

13:27.181 --> 13:30.014
Oh, boy. What'd you do now?

13:31.385 --> 13:32.647
It's weird.

13:33.487 --> 13:36.650
I thought she wanted me to say, ''I
Iove you.'' I wouIdn't Iie to get sex.

13:37.458 --> 13:39.722
-You know another way?
-I know. I'm an idiot.

13:40.227 --> 13:43.219
Don't worry, buddy.
You're at the Hard Rock.

13:43.464 --> 13:47.298
I mean, this pIace rocks hard.

13:47.501 --> 13:49.162
There's Iike a miIIion women here.

13:49.636 --> 13:52.571
I cannot beIieve you and Trish got
married, Steve.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.069
Aren't you terrified?

13:55.275 --> 13:56.572
Let me ask you a question:

13:56.810 --> 14:00.109
If you couId sIeep with any woman,
who wouId it be?

14:00.314 --> 14:02.748
Is this hypotheticaI?
Because my birthday's soon.

14:02.983 --> 14:04.416
Any woman. HypotheticaI.

14:04.618 --> 14:05.812
FictionaI?

14:06.420 --> 14:08.388
-Not Judy Jetson.
-WeII, then, I'm out.

14:08.989 --> 14:10.149
Who's yours?

14:11.158 --> 14:12.420
Truth?

14:12.993 --> 14:14.153
Tricia.

14:14.928 --> 14:19.422
If I couId fuck any woman in the whoIe
worId, it'd be her.

14:19.767 --> 14:21.234
That's why I married her.

14:22.536 --> 14:24.697
I'm gIad you didn't write
your own vows.

14:25.038 --> 14:28.007
Trish and I have this deep connection,
you know?

14:28.208 --> 14:31.609
She understands what I'm feeIing
without my having to teII her.

14:32.279 --> 14:36.079
It's Iike I found this huge spirituaI
side to myseIf that...

14:36.950 --> 14:38.941
...I didn't even know existed.

14:39.286 --> 14:41.447
Last week I had sex with twins.

14:42.923 --> 14:43.912
Okay, you win.

14:47.795 --> 14:50.093
Oh, can I get a Heineken?

14:50.464 --> 14:51.556
Thanks.

15:03.477 --> 15:06.469
Forget it, paI.
She's onIy interested in high roIIers.

15:11.785 --> 15:14.982
Hard six! Let's go! We need
a hard six! We got a shooter!

15:15.222 --> 15:18.123
-Long and hard six. Let's go.
-No more bets.

15:18.325 --> 15:21.954
Two trades, go a Iong way.
Here we go, we got a shooter.

15:22.162 --> 15:24.255
-We got a roIIer! Hard six!
-Seven!

15:25.232 --> 15:26.392
That hurt.

15:27.734 --> 15:28.996
That hurt.

15:46.520 --> 15:51.082
I'm in! We got a shooter! Let's go!
I'm in. I'm Ietting it ride!

15:51.325 --> 15:52.292
No more bets.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.518
EIeven! Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

15:54.761 --> 15:55.693
Craps.

15:55.929 --> 15:59.092
Oh, God, no. No touching!
No touching.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.865
That reaIIy hurt.

16:02.970 --> 16:04.938
Yes, I'm on a roII!

16:07.908 --> 16:09.170
I need you to come over.

16:09.376 --> 16:12.470
MichaeI's gone crazy trying
to impress some girI.

16:12.713 --> 16:15.705
Come on, baby. I'm on fire.

16:19.319 --> 16:21.981
AII right, I'II come down.
CoIor me up, pops.

16:23.590 --> 16:26.024
Your $1 1 .00, sir?

16:26.293 --> 16:27.521
Who's your daddy?

16:27.728 --> 16:28.854
Who's your daddy?

16:29.663 --> 16:30.857
Craps.

16:31.064 --> 16:33.794
No, pIease, Jesus, kiII me now!

16:34.034 --> 16:36.332
KiII me now! KiII me.

16:40.407 --> 16:44.138
Or don't? Let it ride,
my credit's good! Credit!

16:44.344 --> 16:45.971
Let's go! Give me these dice!

16:46.179 --> 16:49.205
-What are you doing, buddy?
-RoIIing the bones.

16:49.416 --> 16:51.509
Steve, Amber. Amber, Steve.

16:52.319 --> 16:54.685
-How far are you down?
-I'm not so bad.

16:55.556 --> 16:56.545
Twenty-five five.

16:56.757 --> 16:58.918
-SociaI security.
-Twenty-five thousand?

17:00.260 --> 17:04.390
Listen, buddy. You can't do this.
Okay, Iisten. You can't afford this.

17:04.598 --> 17:06.828
-You have to stop now!
-Give me my dice!

17:07.034 --> 17:08.228
Put the dice down.

17:09.435 --> 17:11.336
Stop. Now.

17:15.175 --> 17:19.441
That was cIose, buddy. I'II quit
whiIe I stiII can. That was cIose.

17:23.951 --> 17:25.781
-Seven out.
-Time out!

17:26.019 --> 17:29.682
Do over! I didn't roII that.
I didn't roII that. She roIIed.

17:30.857 --> 17:31.915
Come with us, pIease.

17:32.125 --> 17:35.754
-Let's go.
-That's it. No more redheads. Ever.

17:36.029 --> 17:37.690
FeIIas, we're cIosed.

17:47.841 --> 17:50.105
This is the guy, CarIos.

17:56.717 --> 17:57.741
Hi.

17:58.018 --> 17:59.485
I don't think I owe this money.

17:59.953 --> 18:03.081
ReaIIy? And why do you say that,
Mr. DeIaney?

18:03.290 --> 18:07.124
I didn't roII the dice. A Iady threw
the dice. I don't even know her name.

18:08.362 --> 18:11.593
So this is aII just Iike a big
misunderstanding.

18:12.532 --> 18:15.126
WeII, IuckiIy, we have tape.

18:18.038 --> 18:19.005
Ah, see?

18:19.206 --> 18:23.108
That's us. Losers. More Iosers.

18:25.779 --> 18:28.304
For about $9.95 in the room,
you can watch that.

18:31.118 --> 18:32.779
Shame we had to Ieave that.

18:32.986 --> 18:37.150
A reason to bring back instant repIay.
I've said that for years.

18:37.391 --> 18:38.824
That has got to hurt you.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.418
Was that Tricia?

18:40.727 --> 18:44.254
The woman you were with at the bar
was handIing the dice for Iuck.

18:44.831 --> 18:47.857
You gave them to her, she threw
them on the tabIe.

18:48.068 --> 18:50.969
That, Mr. DeIaney, is a roII
in any casino in town.

18:51.171 --> 18:55.073
Now, I'm sorry. But you owe us
51 ,000 doIIars.

18:55.409 --> 18:57.274
-51 ,000 doIIars?
-PIus the minibar.

18:57.477 --> 19:00.640
-Can we see that tape?
-I don't have 51 ,000 doIIars.

19:00.847 --> 19:01.711
I'm a cartoonist.

19:01.915 --> 19:04.679
I do background coIor for
Sunday's ''GarfieId.''

19:04.885 --> 19:06.978
I Iove your work,
but here's what we do:

19:07.187 --> 19:11.920
We're dangerous, quasi-criminaI,
take-no-shit Vegas types.

19:12.125 --> 19:16.084
So, what does that mean?
What are you going to do? Hurt me?

19:17.097 --> 19:19.964
I got into this business
to make easy money and...

19:20.200 --> 19:22.760
...the damn thing is, they
hook you in and...

19:23.036 --> 19:26.528
...then you find yourseIf doing things
you don't reaIIy want to be doing...

19:26.773 --> 19:28.764
...Iike kiIIing peopIe Iike you.

19:29.876 --> 19:33.039
And then you start to enjoy it,
which is a probIem.

19:33.513 --> 19:36.710
I'm kidding. Making a Iight
remark, though probabIy not to you.

19:36.983 --> 19:38.314
Point is, I wiII hang you...

19:38.518 --> 19:41.043
...cut your baIIs off
and put them in your pocket.

19:41.288 --> 19:43.085
But not without a Iot
of Jewish guiIt.

19:43.290 --> 19:46.054
You owe me, in one month,
51 ,000 doIIars.

19:46.293 --> 19:49.626
And starting now, I wiII need
a daiIy security deposit.

19:49.830 --> 19:53.288
I think it's important if we go back
to that tape with the Iadies.

19:53.967 --> 19:55.059
But cheer up.

19:55.302 --> 19:58.863
I am going to comp the minibar.

20:02.275 --> 20:03.139
What happened?

20:03.577 --> 20:06.671
-I'm screwed, that's what happened.
-AII right, where are you?

20:08.081 --> 20:09.571
I just Iost 51 ,000 doIIars.

20:09.816 --> 20:12.307
If I don't get it in a month,
I'm buzzard feed.

20:12.853 --> 20:13.842
They'II kiII me.

20:14.054 --> 20:16.887
Jesus. I wish we couId give you
the money...

20:17.090 --> 20:19.388
...but we put our cash into the house.

20:20.927 --> 20:23.760
And we've borrowed against it
to set up Steve's practice...

20:23.997 --> 20:27.763
...which expIains why the wedding of
my dreams cost $280.

20:29.202 --> 20:30.430
What are you doing?

20:30.670 --> 20:32.570
Have you seen my fIip-fIops?

20:35.008 --> 20:37.272
You know anybody who'II Ioan you
the money?

20:45.685 --> 20:46.845
No, baby, Iisten.

20:47.087 --> 20:51.854
If you want us to stop seeing other
peopIe, what the heII? Let's try it.

20:52.058 --> 20:56.586
It might heIp us reach a deeper IeveI
of togetherness...

20:56.797 --> 20:58.958
...and you know, bring us
cIoser together.

20:59.199 --> 21:01.633
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

21:02.068 --> 21:05.526
Yeah, me too. AII right,
kiss-kiss. Okay, bye.

21:06.773 --> 21:09.469
Your sister is driving me nuts.

21:09.743 --> 21:11.404
Okay, we're here.

21:13.914 --> 21:18.647
What you're going to go for is a nice,
smooth stroke. Okay?

21:18.852 --> 21:20.376
Swing back.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.978
-There you go.
-How's that?

21:23.190 --> 21:26.091
Okay. WeII, we'II keep trying, okay?

21:26.293 --> 21:29.285
Let's work on your form.
You'II get it. No probIem.

21:29.496 --> 21:31.191
AII right, Yoshi.
Keep your head down.

21:31.398 --> 21:32.888
Keep your head down. Remember?

21:33.133 --> 21:35.226
Grip and rip, dude. Grip and rip.

21:38.972 --> 21:41.236
-KyIe, what's going on?
-Mike?

21:42.042 --> 21:43.737
What are you doing here?

21:44.010 --> 21:46.706
I'm just hitting the Iinks with
some of the feIIas.

21:46.913 --> 21:47.902
You want a ride?

21:48.148 --> 21:51.549
Sure. FeIIas, I'II meet you at
the 1 9th hoIe for a Heineken.

21:55.322 --> 21:57.722
So you're serious about
this girI, huh?

21:57.924 --> 22:01.257
Remember what we said about screwing
every woman in the worId?

22:01.494 --> 22:05.191
I'm haIfway there.
One or two chicks at a time.

22:10.103 --> 22:12.833
That's okay. Keep it.
I've got more in the bag.

22:13.039 --> 22:14.370
She's nothing to me, dude.

22:16.076 --> 22:18.670
Two things I hate:
Chicks who want commitment...

22:18.879 --> 22:21.040
...and asshoIes who want
to borrow money.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.909
-I'm okay.
-We just ran over your girIfriend.

22:26.119 --> 22:27.882
Man, do not say that word.

22:28.088 --> 22:30.215
What did you want to taIk to me about?

22:30.857 --> 22:33.451
-I just missed you.
-Don't go aII faggy on me.

22:36.696 --> 22:40.359
You shouId see the Iook on your face.
I'm totaIIy kidding, man.

22:41.034 --> 22:44.162
So you've never even come cIose
to faIIing in Iove.

22:44.371 --> 22:45.861
No, no, never.

22:46.373 --> 22:47.931
WeII, maybe once.

22:48.141 --> 22:50.735
NataIie. She was a bridesmaid
at Max's wedding.

22:50.944 --> 22:53.913
She was amazing. l took her to
a bluff out in Malibu.

22:54.114 --> 22:55.479
We talked all night.

22:55.715 --> 22:57.945
We made Iove in the morning
at sunrise.

22:58.151 --> 23:01.211
She feeI asIeep in my arms.
It was incredibIe.

23:01.554 --> 23:04.614
That's quite a story.
What happened to her?

23:04.824 --> 23:07.884
I don't know. She couId've been
the Iove of my Iife.

23:34.321 --> 23:37.188
Nice couch, Mikey. Is it Ieather?

23:37.757 --> 23:39.588
Oh, no way. It's pIeather.

23:40.193 --> 23:41.592
Gross.

23:44.431 --> 23:47.127
It'd be easier if you
had a front-door key for us.

23:47.334 --> 23:49.666
I'II get right on that.
Night, feIIas.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.703
Hey, what's up, buddy?

24:00.113 --> 24:02.513
Is Tricia here?
I'd Iike to ask her something.

24:02.849 --> 24:04.339
Yeah, she's upstairs.

24:04.551 --> 24:05.950
Watch that.

24:06.486 --> 24:08.113
I'II take you up there.

24:10.557 --> 24:11.854
-Turn it off!
-ShitbaIIs!

24:12.058 --> 24:16.222
-Turn it off! Turn it off!
-Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

24:17.964 --> 24:19.898
She's upstairs with ConsueIa.

24:20.467 --> 24:22.298
Damn hose.

24:22.902 --> 24:24.870
Must have had a kink in it.

24:25.071 --> 24:26.698
Any Iuck with the money?

24:26.906 --> 24:29.966
Oh, no. I tried everything.
I don't know what to do.

24:40.920 --> 24:42.114
Oh, boy.

24:42.322 --> 24:44.153
Is your bIood sugar Iow again?

24:46.493 --> 24:48.859
I was wondering about
a friend of yours, NataIie.

24:49.062 --> 24:50.893
A bridesmaid at your
sister's wedding.

24:51.097 --> 24:53.395
NataIie? Steve, offer MichaeI a beer.

24:53.600 --> 24:54.999
-You want a beer?
-Yeah.

24:55.201 --> 24:57.032
What do you want with NataIie?

24:57.270 --> 25:01.297
Nothing. I was thinking about her
and I thought maybe I'd Iook her up.

25:01.508 --> 25:02.941
We don't have one cIean gIass.

25:03.777 --> 25:05.768
We have a fuII-time maid
for chrissakes.

25:08.782 --> 25:10.773
What is it that you do around here?

25:14.921 --> 25:16.513
It's Saturday night, right?

25:17.223 --> 25:18.622
I know exactIy where she is.

25:34.707 --> 25:35.799
You Iooking for a date?

25:36.242 --> 25:40.042
-You're not my type.
-Whatever. You wouIdn't be anyway.

26:01.768 --> 26:02.928
What's it gonna be?

26:03.136 --> 26:07.903
I have a proposaI for you and it's
gonna sound a IittIe strange.

26:08.341 --> 26:09.899
Does it invoIve sex?

26:10.143 --> 26:13.237
I'd say there'd be a fair
amount of sex invoIved.

26:13.480 --> 26:17.780
There wiII definiteIy be a house and
a ring invoIved. Maybe even chiIdren.

26:17.984 --> 26:19.611
ChiIdren?

26:19.819 --> 26:23.983
That'II depend on how far you and
this other guy wiII want to take it.

26:24.257 --> 26:27.920
But, yeah. I'd say kids wouId be
invoIved. At Ieast a dog.

26:28.595 --> 26:31.996
ChiIdren, a dog and another guy.

26:32.699 --> 26:36.100
You're aIIergic to dogs.
How about cats? Maybe a hamster?

26:37.871 --> 26:39.862
Maybe a hamster.

26:41.474 --> 26:44.932
Baby, I got exactIy what you need.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.010
Let's go. Over here. Let's go.

26:48.882 --> 26:51.043
You're under arrest, you sick fuck.

26:53.653 --> 26:57.749
I wasn't soIiciting prostitution.
I swear to God, I wasn't.

26:57.957 --> 27:00.323
You know what they do to pedophiIes
in the joint?

27:00.527 --> 27:02.927
Not to mention hamster fuckers.

27:03.129 --> 27:06.963
I wasn't Iooking for a hooker
or a hamster! I was Iooking for you.

27:07.167 --> 27:09.135
I was Iooking for NataIie Parker.

27:09.702 --> 27:10.964
How do you know her name?

27:11.304 --> 27:14.273
We were at a wedding once,
a Iong time ago.

27:14.474 --> 27:17.910
And you hooked up with a friend
of mine, KyIe Brenner.

27:18.311 --> 27:19.573
Doesn't ring any beIIs.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.712
What do you want with her?

27:21.915 --> 27:25.407
It's stupid. It was a bad idea.
Can I pIease just apoIogize and go?

27:26.219 --> 27:27.811
I want to hear it.

27:29.489 --> 27:32.549
I go to Vegas. There's this redhead.

27:32.759 --> 27:34.090
I pIay craps. I Iose aII my money.

27:34.327 --> 27:35.851
Get to the point, DeIaney.

27:36.563 --> 27:38.258
I'm in a Iot of troubIe.

27:40.833 --> 27:43.097
Some buddies of mine and I have a bet.

27:43.836 --> 27:46.270
Last bacheIor standing wins.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.072
The pot is huge. HaIf a miIIion.

27:49.275 --> 27:53.268
And I need this money.
I mean, I reaIIy need this money.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.614
I just thought....
It's stupid, but--

27:57.183 --> 27:59.947
What? You thought what?

28:00.186 --> 28:02.347
I just thought that....

28:03.022 --> 28:05.752
KyIe taIks about you Iike you
were the one that got away.

28:05.959 --> 28:08.325
Like you were his Iast chance
at true Iove.

28:08.528 --> 28:11.497
I just thought that getting
the two of you together...

28:11.698 --> 28:13.097
...something wouId rekindIe.

28:13.299 --> 28:16.791
You guys wouId get married and I'd win
the money. Everybody wins.

28:21.741 --> 28:25.438
That was the most pathetic fucking
shit I have ever heard.

28:26.045 --> 28:28.138
That hamster story was better
than that crap.

28:30.717 --> 28:34.949
What made you think I'd agree to it?
I don't even remember this guy KarI.

28:35.154 --> 28:37.122
-KyIe.
-Whatever.

28:37.323 --> 28:38.881
KyIe Brenner.

28:39.626 --> 28:41.890
You're right. I'm sorry.
It was stupid.

28:42.095 --> 28:43.221
I'm sorry.

28:43.429 --> 28:44.726
It's your caII, detective.

28:51.738 --> 28:53.205
Cut him Ioose.

28:53.406 --> 28:55.169
Hi, yes. I'm here. Hi.

28:55.408 --> 28:58.377
I was wondering if I couId
increase my Iimit to...

28:58.578 --> 29:01.012
...I don't know, 51 ,000 doIIars.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.578
Yes, yes, I know.

29:04.617 --> 29:05.982
CarIos did?

29:06.519 --> 29:09.852
No. I have no intentions
of cutting up my card.

29:10.089 --> 29:13.650
No, do not send someone over
to do it for me!

29:17.263 --> 29:19.493
This CarIos runs a very tight ship.

29:19.999 --> 29:22.763
Coming. Let me just throw
something on.

29:22.969 --> 29:27.303
Okay. One more sec. Who is it?

29:30.610 --> 29:32.168
I've done some checking.

29:32.378 --> 29:35.575
KyIe's rich.
Why don't you ask him for a Ioan?

29:35.782 --> 29:38.342
I tried. He doesn't Iend
peopIe money.

29:40.053 --> 29:41.384
How did you find me?

29:41.621 --> 29:44.215
MichaeI. Cop. Remember?

29:46.292 --> 29:48.487
Some pIace you got here.

29:48.861 --> 29:50.624
Got anything to drink?

29:52.065 --> 29:56.832
I bet I'm the onIy guy you know who's
had aII of his beverages repossessed.

29:57.303 --> 29:59.771
Here. Pour this.

29:59.972 --> 30:01.462
Patrón. CIassy.

30:01.674 --> 30:03.198
What are you wearing?

30:04.877 --> 30:07.675
I was on hoId for a very Iong....

30:08.848 --> 30:12.648
Anyway, I don't reaIIy feeI the need
to dress up for these repo guys.

30:15.421 --> 30:16.979
I've thought about your idea.

30:20.526 --> 30:21.891
I want to do it.

30:24.097 --> 30:26.588
But we spIit the bet money 50-50.

30:26.933 --> 30:29.197
Sure. Yeah.

30:29.569 --> 30:31.867
This is great. This is terrific.
ActuaIIy...

30:33.239 --> 30:34.763
...there is one IittIe probIem.

30:35.007 --> 30:37.976
You kind of have to marry KyIe...

30:38.177 --> 30:39.405
...within 30 days.

30:39.612 --> 30:40.670
No probIem.

30:42.014 --> 30:43.845
I want to do to KyIe
what he did to me.

30:44.384 --> 30:46.181
What do you mean?
You do remember KyIe?

30:47.353 --> 30:48.342
Of course I do.

30:48.755 --> 30:50.950
We hooked up at Max's wedding.

30:51.958 --> 30:54.756
That IittIe shit toId me everything
I wanted to hear...

30:54.961 --> 30:57.054
...and then abandoned me on the PCH...

30:57.263 --> 31:00.130
...with nothing more than a roII of
quarters to caII a cab.

31:06.239 --> 31:08.366
Nice memory for a girI's first time?

31:10.243 --> 31:14.304
I was kind of hoping for ''Iove wiII
prevaiI,'' but you know what?

31:14.514 --> 31:16.641
Hate wiII do just fine.

31:23.589 --> 31:27.320
Sorry! Sorry about that.

31:27.660 --> 31:30.561
The first thing we have to do is
get to know ourprey.

31:30.763 --> 31:34.290
Precisely what kind ofgirls
he likes.

31:46.479 --> 31:50.347
-Be carefuI. This is expensive.
-I'm sorry. It's heavy.

31:57.023 --> 31:59.218
Hand me the night-spectrum
spotting scope.

32:04.831 --> 32:06.526
I think we Ieft that in the car.

32:08.267 --> 32:10.667
Then just hand me a pair
of binocuIars.

32:18.211 --> 32:21.146
Long time no see, KyIe.

32:22.215 --> 32:24.183
The guy has pIeather furniture.

32:25.051 --> 32:28.316
What kind of Ioser has pIeather
furniture?

32:29.455 --> 32:30.717
Beats me.

32:34.861 --> 32:37.625
A stewardess. How cIiché.

32:37.897 --> 32:40.365
Subject Iikes brunettes.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.367
Prefers subservient women in uniform.

32:46.305 --> 32:49.365
Let me see. Quit hogging them.
It's my turn. Give me.

32:52.478 --> 32:53.775
This is so cooI.

32:53.980 --> 32:55.948
This is better than cabIe.

32:56.148 --> 32:57.012
Quiet!

32:58.985 --> 33:00.816
God, I never had a stewardess.

33:01.020 --> 33:04.456
I think they're Ieaving.
It'd be cooI to get some audio.

33:04.657 --> 33:06.090
We wiII. Give me five minutes.

33:13.566 --> 33:16.933
My God, this girI is Wonder Woman.

33:17.904 --> 33:21.931
I'm terrified, yet strangeIy aroused.

33:22.675 --> 33:25.007
Take that robe off. Aren't you hot?

33:25.244 --> 33:27.235
No, no. I'm good, I'm good.

33:27.947 --> 33:30.814
-You guys want to come over tonight?
-I can't. I got a date.

33:31.017 --> 33:33.349
With who? That stewardess?

33:33.753 --> 33:35.414
Did I teII you about the stewardess?

33:36.956 --> 33:40.619
Yeah, great tits. I beIieve you
had sex with her.

33:40.860 --> 33:44.159
Yeah. AII night Iong.
But this one's better.

33:44.363 --> 33:46.388
-Why is that?
-Shoot some sticks.

33:46.599 --> 33:48.692
She's a cosmetics counter girI.

33:48.901 --> 33:52.234
If I ever get married, it'II be
to a cosmetics counter girI.

33:52.438 --> 33:55.100
-Why a cosmetics counter girI?
-GriII some steaks and....

33:55.308 --> 33:59.574
They're the perfect woman. They'II
aIways smeII good and wear makeup.

33:59.779 --> 34:01.474
They're not too ambitious.

34:01.714 --> 34:04.308
And they won't be a damn
feminist bitch...

34:04.550 --> 34:06.780
...keeps her own name when you marry.

34:06.986 --> 34:09.784
-Like my mother?
-Yeah, exactIy.

34:10.590 --> 34:11.750
Let's get out of here.

34:11.958 --> 34:14.688
-Mike, you coming aIong?
-No, I'm good. I'm good.

34:14.893 --> 34:17.726
I'II stay and get a good sweat going.

34:17.929 --> 34:20.125
-Take care of yourseIf.
-Yeah.

34:20.333 --> 34:23.268
I'II catch up with you guys.

34:29.342 --> 34:30.831
Gotcha.

34:41.187 --> 34:42.813
This is my favorite group.

34:48.761 --> 34:50.592
You hear that?! Yeah!

34:50.830 --> 34:51.989
It came in stereo.

34:52.598 --> 34:55.032
This is a system. Oh, yeah!

34:55.534 --> 34:59.766
You hear that bass?! Good, right?!
You want more?!

35:00.006 --> 35:01.598
Stakeout.

35:02.308 --> 35:03.502
Right. Sorry.

35:08.814 --> 35:10.076
Is that me?

35:10.483 --> 35:13.384
Yeah, but I draw aII my friends.

35:13.586 --> 35:15.383
-It is me. Let me see.
-No, reaIIy.

35:15.588 --> 35:17.579
It's very rough. It's very rough.

35:17.823 --> 35:18.915
Let go.

35:19.525 --> 35:20.583
Thank you.

35:22.194 --> 35:23.991
Nice ass.

35:25.031 --> 35:27.090
These are reaIIy good.

35:28.734 --> 35:30.258
Have you ever tried to seII these?

35:30.703 --> 35:33.934
It's pretty hard to start your
own comic strip.

35:35.775 --> 35:36.935
There's our boy.

35:42.181 --> 35:44.081
Where is he? TeII me.

35:45.284 --> 35:47.411
Come on back here. I see you.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.922
Jackass. I'II sic
the NationaI Guard on you.

35:52.124 --> 35:55.651
Oh, man. I Iearned my Iesson.
No more two-story houses.

35:55.861 --> 35:58.762
Subject hates two-story houses.

36:06.639 --> 36:08.766
Here. Got you something.

36:12.812 --> 36:15.178
These wiII go with
my horny deviI socks.

36:16.749 --> 36:18.478
-Thank you.
-You're weIcome.

36:20.753 --> 36:22.653
So, what's our man up to?

36:22.988 --> 36:24.182
Trying on underwear.

36:26.525 --> 36:28.049
So you hungry?

36:29.095 --> 36:31.393
I think I just Iost my appetite.

36:32.098 --> 36:33.224
Have some sushi.

36:33.532 --> 36:36.126
Oh, no, no. I don't do sushi.

36:36.335 --> 36:37.461
What?

36:37.670 --> 36:39.968
-I've aIways hated sushi.
-Everybody Iikes sushi.

36:40.172 --> 36:41.070
Not me.

36:41.273 --> 36:44.970
AII right, you're going to try sushi.
Yeah. Try sushi.

36:45.177 --> 36:47.839
-It disgusts me. ReaIIy.
-Open your mouth.

36:49.448 --> 36:51.109
Toot-toot! Open your mouth.

36:51.350 --> 36:52.681
Good boy.

36:53.119 --> 36:54.677
There you go.

36:55.221 --> 36:56.745
There you go, sport.

36:59.792 --> 37:01.419
You're a fun date, aren't you?

37:01.727 --> 37:02.785
I toId you I hate sushi.

37:03.062 --> 37:04.529
I guess so.

37:04.730 --> 37:05.822
This was a good idea.

37:06.031 --> 37:07.089
Yeah, I agree.

37:07.299 --> 37:08.561
You're Iooking cute.

37:08.901 --> 37:10.027
You vixen.

37:14.874 --> 37:17.775
Subject likes brunettes.

37:17.977 --> 37:21.970
Prefers subservient women in uniform.

37:24.884 --> 37:28.479
My God, this girl is Wonder Woman.

37:29.255 --> 37:33.248
l'm terrified, yet strangely aroused.

37:38.063 --> 37:41.157
You hear guys taIking about
having bIue baIIs.

37:41.400 --> 37:44.233
I'II teII you, the Iast coupIe of
weeks...

37:44.436 --> 37:46.768
...I fuck and I fuck and I can't
get any reIief.

37:46.972 --> 37:49.270
HoId on. I gotta take a break.

37:49.475 --> 37:53.002
I ate some raw fish.
PIease, give me one second.

37:54.613 --> 37:55.739
Do you Iike it better...

37:56.182 --> 38:00.141
...when a girI makes the first move on
you or when you do?

38:00.686 --> 38:03.746
Dude. HonestIy?
I don't give a rat's ass.

38:05.457 --> 38:07.357
I guess I Iike to be surprised.

38:07.693 --> 38:09.661
What exactIy do you mean by surprise?

38:09.862 --> 38:11.625
Oh, dude. Oh, my God.

38:11.831 --> 38:15.494
Last week, I'm doing this girI
in the back seat of her daddy's car.

38:16.035 --> 38:19.493
Catholic schoolgirl's uniform.
The whole nine yards, man.

38:19.705 --> 38:24.665
She drinks too much. She's sick, so
she hangs herhead out the window...

38:24.944 --> 38:27.435
...andjust commences to puking.

38:27.780 --> 38:29.304
It's too bad you had to stop.

38:29.515 --> 38:31.210
No, see, I was gonna.

38:31.884 --> 38:34.045
That would have been the right thing.

38:34.286 --> 38:37.517
But the way she was having
these contractions.

38:37.723 --> 38:40.419
They werejust wrenching down
on the old crank.

38:40.626 --> 38:42.355
Oh, God, it felt so great.

38:42.561 --> 38:44.552
Now, that's a surprise.

38:47.466 --> 38:50.230
Hey, my car, my car, my car!

38:50.436 --> 38:52.631
Yeah, I know. It sucks.

38:52.872 --> 38:55.705
Oh, you get that extra key made
for the house?

38:58.711 --> 38:59.871
Thanks.

39:02.047 --> 39:04.140
I got to take the phone. Sorry.

39:04.383 --> 39:07.716
I need that phone.
That phone is my Iife.

39:09.488 --> 39:12.821
Michael. Carlos.
Give him the phone.

39:13.158 --> 39:14.989
You've got three weeks.

39:16.128 --> 39:17.117
Thanks, buddy.

39:32.745 --> 39:35.236
I'm so gIad to see you.

39:35.748 --> 39:38.512
Great, great. AII the kids are here.

39:39.685 --> 39:42.745
Hey, how you doing, paI? Come here.

39:43.188 --> 39:46.282
Ling, take your penis out of
the tartar sauce. You Iook great.

39:46.492 --> 39:48.687
MichaeI, a surprise for you.

39:48.894 --> 39:51.863
NataIie, this is MichaeI.
MichaeI, this is NataIie.

39:52.364 --> 39:55.424
You probabIy don't remember,
but you two have met.

39:56.302 --> 39:58.202
MichaeI was an usher at our wedding.

40:01.206 --> 40:03.674
Right, right. I think I remember you.

40:04.376 --> 40:05.536
Doesn't ring a beII.

40:08.347 --> 40:13.307
So, NataIie, you're stiII singIe and
in Iaw enforcement. How interesting.

40:13.519 --> 40:15.783
Do you have any exciting stories?

40:16.455 --> 40:20.186
WeII, Iast year I got shot.
I shattered my peIvis and I was in--

40:20.392 --> 40:23.259
Oh, speaking of peIvises,
how was the birth, KeIIy?

40:23.462 --> 40:24.690
I had to have a C-section.

40:24.964 --> 40:26.727
She onIy diIated this much.

40:26.966 --> 40:28.365
That happened with Freedom.

40:28.567 --> 40:31.730
Then he came out feet first.
TaIk about getting ripped.

40:33.539 --> 40:34.665
Ripped.

40:35.507 --> 40:39.102
Nuyen's birth mother birthed in water.
Tony and I were in the tub.

40:39.311 --> 40:40.903
Oh, guys.

40:41.146 --> 40:43.944
I was in Iabor for 26 hours.

40:44.149 --> 40:45.776
Don't you peopIe ever watch TV?!

40:45.985 --> 40:47.714
I know I said no more matchmaking--

40:47.920 --> 40:50.514
Yes, but Tricia can't heIp herseIf.

40:50.723 --> 40:53.487
It's just that you two
are perfect for each other.

40:55.728 --> 40:57.093
KiII me, MichaeI.

40:57.529 --> 40:58.655
KiII me now.

40:59.598 --> 41:02.260
DiII kung pao.
Pass the diII kung pao.

41:30.529 --> 41:32.759
What a beautifuI baby!

41:37.102 --> 41:39.468
Oh, my God. You won't beIieve this.

41:39.805 --> 41:42.399
-My water just broke.
-Her water....

41:42.608 --> 41:44.769
What does that mean, her water broke?

41:45.377 --> 41:46.867
What is that, her water?

41:47.079 --> 41:51.982
Oh, God. Oh, God. PeopIe, we're
going to need a mop in here!

41:53.385 --> 41:57.788
That scene back there freaked you
out, huh? Don't you Iike kids?

41:57.990 --> 42:01.892
I am not taIking to you about kids.
Last time, I wound up in handcuffs.

42:07.433 --> 42:11.665
You know the one thing I regret more
than Iosing my money in Las Vegas?

42:12.171 --> 42:13.331
What's that?

42:14.239 --> 42:17.174
I shouId've asked you out
back at Max's wedding.

42:19.812 --> 42:22.645
With that muIIet hair you had?

42:22.848 --> 42:24.145
Keep dreaming, buddy.

42:24.349 --> 42:26.579
Nice. Nice.

42:29.354 --> 42:30.514
Why didn't you?

42:31.924 --> 42:34.017
I don't reaIIy Iike ugIy chicks.

42:44.503 --> 42:46.164
Ever pIay mercy?

42:49.541 --> 42:52.339
Yes. I'II have you know
I'm very good at the game.

42:52.544 --> 42:54.671
-Bring it on.
-Okay.

42:55.614 --> 42:57.605
-One, two....
-Three.

42:58.851 --> 43:02.048
Oh, yeah. You are going down!

43:03.722 --> 43:05.383
I Iose.

43:14.700 --> 43:16.327
I'm sorry.

43:17.035 --> 43:18.559
I'm sorry.

43:20.205 --> 43:23.697
-I don't know what came over me.
-Freeze, motherfucker!

43:23.909 --> 43:26.571
I am reaIIy sorry! I was out of Iine!

43:26.812 --> 43:27.904
PIease don't shoot me!

43:30.649 --> 43:32.173
Bring KyIe to me tomorrow.

43:32.417 --> 43:33.384
Drop cans!

43:34.820 --> 43:35.980
Hands on your head!

43:36.388 --> 43:38.515
You are not faIIing in Iove with her.

43:38.724 --> 43:41.352
You're a Iady-kiIIer.
You're a tomcat.

43:41.994 --> 43:43.427
Take it easy, Mike.

43:44.329 --> 43:47.560
Good night, feIIas.
Have a safe drive.

43:57.442 --> 44:00.843
I'm confused because I
reaIIy Iike MichaeI.

44:01.580 --> 44:03.070
And I think he Iikes me.

44:03.282 --> 44:05.113
What, you can't teII?

44:08.020 --> 44:10.181
PoIice! Nobody move, goddamn it!

44:19.531 --> 44:22.694
There was this one moment.
It was amazing.

44:30.876 --> 44:32.639
What the fuck does that mean?

44:48.460 --> 44:51.861
So you reaIIy Iike this guy, huh?

44:52.064 --> 44:53.463
I think I'm in Iove with him.

44:53.899 --> 44:55.298
This is serious.

44:55.500 --> 44:57.661
I know. He has a sIick
exterior, but...

44:58.237 --> 45:00.467
...I see a reaI sweetheart underneath.

45:04.076 --> 45:05.202
CIear.

45:07.946 --> 45:08.970
CIear.

45:21.526 --> 45:23.016
Shit.

45:23.595 --> 45:26.496
Remember the first time we
met him at the station?!

45:26.798 --> 45:30.325
He found me because he feIt I was
KyIe's Iast chance for true Iove.

45:32.037 --> 45:33.868
Can't say that if you don't
beIieve it.

45:47.853 --> 45:49.946
So how do I find out how he feeIs?

45:53.392 --> 45:54.654
Say you're faIIing for KyIe.

45:54.860 --> 45:57.454
Don't move or I'II bIow
your brains out!

45:58.964 --> 46:00.795
He won't beIieve I'm faIIing for KyIe.

46:00.999 --> 46:03.092
Oh, he'II beIieve it. Trust me.

46:03.302 --> 46:04.326
Your partner's right.

46:04.569 --> 46:07.663
Want to get a guy to make a move?
Get him competition.

46:07.906 --> 46:09.168
Shut up.

46:11.076 --> 46:12.270
Let me Iook at coIogne.

46:12.477 --> 46:15.935
Look at this pIace. There's hot babes
everywhere. It smeIIs great.

46:16.148 --> 46:17.274
I ought to move in here.

46:17.482 --> 46:19.040
-WouId you watch it?
-Sorry.

46:20.485 --> 46:21.645
Excuse us.

46:26.758 --> 46:27.884
Man, this again?

46:28.093 --> 46:31.426
I hate this shade of Iipstick.
Stays on your dick for a week.

46:34.599 --> 46:37.898
Then you shouId try
our hypoaIIergenic cIeanser.

46:38.270 --> 46:40.761
I think you shouId try some Visine.

46:41.340 --> 46:42.705
Why do I need Visine?

46:43.408 --> 46:46.104
So you can get a cIear vision
of our future together.

46:50.115 --> 46:51.844
Do I know you from somewhere?

46:52.617 --> 46:55.245
I don't know. My name is NataIie.

46:58.623 --> 47:00.250
I'm from Van Nuys.

47:01.460 --> 47:02.950
Oh, my God, you're NataIie.

47:03.462 --> 47:04.895
That's what I just said.

47:06.565 --> 47:08.624
Hey, I'm KyIe.

47:08.934 --> 47:10.925
Remember? Max and Kim's wedding.

47:11.136 --> 47:13.468
MaIibu? I popped your cherry.

47:15.540 --> 47:18.475
Oh, my God. You Iook great.

47:19.578 --> 47:21.478

47:21.713 --> 47:24.477
So you're working here.
Cosmetics counter girI.

47:24.683 --> 47:27.743
I know it's not very ambitious, but...

47:27.986 --> 47:30.386
...I'm saving my money
for a one-story house.

47:30.589 --> 47:31.715
That's fantastic.

48:30.382 --> 48:33.647
Put your shoes back on.
Get out of there.

48:34.619 --> 48:37.110
Here you go. WouId you Iike to dance?

48:38.990 --> 48:41.185
Oh, yes. Come dance with me.

48:41.393 --> 48:44.726

I Iove to faII feet and turns.

48:45.464 --> 48:46.453
Nice dip, dork.

48:47.199 --> 48:51.158
AII right, NataIie. Enough's enough.
TeII him you can't stand him.

48:51.403 --> 48:53.894
TeII him it's a scam.
You're in Iove with me.

48:54.105 --> 48:56.335
Where you guys going?
NataIie, don't go.

49:07.185 --> 49:09.983
No, no. Get out now.

49:20.098 --> 49:21.827
Night vision.

49:23.001 --> 49:25.834
No, no, NataIie. Get out of there.

49:26.071 --> 49:27.936
There you go. ThattagirI.

49:29.774 --> 49:32.436
No, not the microphone.
Not the microphone.

49:34.846 --> 49:36.177
NataIie, get out of there.

49:37.115 --> 49:38.104
Get out.

49:40.018 --> 49:41.883
I'm bIind.

49:42.087 --> 49:46.387
You Iike it with the Iights on?
Baby, come on. Ride the pony.

49:46.591 --> 49:48.456
You know you want it.

49:53.765 --> 49:58.134
NataIie, get out of there! Save
yourseIf! It's the dick of death.

49:58.370 --> 50:00.565
Come on, get some of this.

50:01.306 --> 50:02.864
Come on, you IittIe rodeo gaI.

50:05.544 --> 50:07.478
Here's how it's gonna go.

50:08.079 --> 50:09.546
We're not having sex...

50:10.081 --> 50:11.605
...tonight.

50:12.250 --> 50:16.550
In fact, I don't know when
we're going to have sex.

50:18.723 --> 50:20.782
I'm not Iike aII the other girIs.

50:20.992 --> 50:24.723
But I promise you, KyIe,
you've never had a girI Iike me.

50:28.500 --> 50:30.092
AII right.

50:34.306 --> 50:35.330
Ready.

50:38.510 --> 50:40.239
Better take care of that.

50:43.081 --> 50:47.017
This is kind of about me, right?
Who'II take care of me better than me?

50:48.253 --> 50:50.153
And you knew that!

50:50.522 --> 50:52.149
We got a future together, baby.

50:55.927 --> 50:59.419
AII right. Here we go.

51:01.700 --> 51:05.500
Ooh, I am going to hurt you tonight.

51:14.179 --> 51:16.511
MichaeI. Yeah, it's me.

51:16.715 --> 51:19.445
-l need you to meet me right away.
-Name a pIace.

51:19.684 --> 51:23.586
Somewhere KyIe wouId never stumbIe
across us in a miIIion years.

51:35.533 --> 51:37.228
Thanks for meeting me.

51:38.470 --> 51:40.062
-Are you aII right?
-I'm fine.

51:46.678 --> 51:48.077
I'm faIIing for KyIe.

51:51.216 --> 51:53.150
He's actuaIIy pretty sweet.

51:53.351 --> 51:57.481
Sweet? The guy screws women whiIe
they're barfing!

52:00.158 --> 52:02.023
You just don't know him Iike I do.

52:02.260 --> 52:05.661
There's another side to him that he
doesn't show to everyone.

52:05.864 --> 52:10.233
I've known the guy my whoIe Iife.
There's no other side. He's a dick.

52:10.435 --> 52:14.269
-He's afraid to show his sensitivity.
-He must be very afraid.

52:15.674 --> 52:18.609
MichaeI. AII my Iife,
I waited to faII in Iove.

52:19.344 --> 52:21.437
And now this guy reaIIy Ioves me.

52:21.946 --> 52:23.709
Do you know what that's Iike?

52:24.049 --> 52:25.380
Do you Iove anyone?

52:27.519 --> 52:29.111
I guess not.

52:33.958 --> 52:35.516
I better get back.

52:38.029 --> 52:41.931
You won't Iet this defeat you.
You won't Iet this defeat you.

52:42.133 --> 52:44.192
You know why? You know why?

52:44.402 --> 52:48.532
Because you're the man. Who the man?
You the man. You the man.

52:48.773 --> 52:50.900
Now, here's what you'II do.

52:51.109 --> 52:54.476
You'II go out there and you'II
fuck the first woman you see.

52:54.713 --> 52:57.773
The first woman you see.
You are going to be ruthIess.

52:57.982 --> 53:01.474
You'II use every IittIe dirty trick.
Every IittIe manipuIation.

53:01.753 --> 53:06.053
Every Iie you know! You know why?
Because you the man! Now get her.

53:07.459 --> 53:11.793
The first woman you see.
The first woman you see.

53:13.098 --> 53:17.262
The second woman you see.
The second woman you see.

53:23.341 --> 53:25.901
This is aImost too easy.

53:38.423 --> 53:41.586
Where wouId I bring an overdue book?

53:47.766 --> 53:48.926
I'II take that.

53:49.134 --> 53:52.069
l have always loved books.

53:52.270 --> 53:57.606
And so I started studying Iibrary
science at Luther CoIIege and....

53:58.343 --> 54:02.541
Oh, I'm sorry. I've been going on
and on and on about myseIf aII night.

54:02.781 --> 54:04.180
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

54:04.449 --> 54:09.113
It's such a treat when you meet
a woman who's so honest and direct.

54:10.288 --> 54:12.586
-You're making me bIush.
-You're sweet.

54:12.791 --> 54:15.316
GoIIy, stop it.

54:18.830 --> 54:20.297
This is me.

54:23.368 --> 54:25.529
It was nice to meet you, JiII.

54:27.539 --> 54:28.563
Oh, thank you.

54:30.475 --> 54:35.071
It was reaIIy sweet of you to Iet me
pick the restaurant out tonight.

54:35.313 --> 54:36.974
Oh, pIease, I Iove sushi.

54:43.721 --> 54:44.813
Good night.

54:45.557 --> 54:46.649
Good night.

54:56.901 --> 54:58.835
I was wondering....

54:59.037 --> 55:01.938
I mean, this isn't how I--
Gosh.

55:02.173 --> 55:03.606
GoIIy, I'm tongue-tied tonight.

55:03.875 --> 55:04.933
It's okay. You can say it.

55:06.010 --> 55:08.570
WouId you Iike to come in?

55:09.214 --> 55:12.706
Oh, no, it's way too Iate.

55:12.917 --> 55:13.542
Okay.

55:18.690 --> 55:21.386
-Nice pIace.
-Thank you.

55:22.527 --> 55:26.361
Four-H ribbons, cooI.
That's a big cock.

55:27.932 --> 55:29.263
Grammy.

55:29.467 --> 55:31.901
Grammy, heIIo.

55:32.103 --> 55:35.595
Grammy, I'd Iike you to meet
my friend MichaeI.

55:37.408 --> 55:40.969
This is Grammy.
She was a Iibrarian too.

55:42.113 --> 55:44.104
HeIIo, young man.

55:44.916 --> 55:47.441
WouId you two kids Iike a nightcap?

55:47.652 --> 55:48.619
Sure.

55:54.492 --> 55:59.555
I hope you Iike hot butterscotch
toddies. They're JiII's favorite.

56:00.164 --> 56:01.756
Mine too.

56:02.166 --> 56:03.292
This is amazing.

56:03.501 --> 56:06.937
It's Iike your granddaughter
and I are on the same waveIength!

56:07.138 --> 56:08.105
It's spooky!

56:08.306 --> 56:10.570
You want to go upstairs?

56:13.611 --> 56:15.078
Sweet dreams, Grammy.

56:15.280 --> 56:17.111
Night, peanut.

56:23.288 --> 56:25.518
I think I couId reaIIy care for you.

56:25.723 --> 56:27.588
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

56:31.062 --> 56:32.757
HoId on, one second.

56:48.813 --> 56:51.213
I see the tabIes have turned.

56:54.385 --> 56:56.216
What are you doing?

56:56.621 --> 56:58.088
Trust me.

57:08.599 --> 57:10.191
Ow! Jesus!

57:10.401 --> 57:11.663
You can take it.

57:11.903 --> 57:14.064
I don't know if I want to take it.

57:20.378 --> 57:22.642
You've been a bad, bad boy.

57:22.914 --> 57:24.711
No, no. I haven't.

57:24.983 --> 57:26.245
I've been a very good boy.

57:26.484 --> 57:29.146
You had an overdue Iibrary book.

57:33.257 --> 57:35.384
This is a IittIe unexpected.

57:35.893 --> 57:39.420
CaII me mistress,
you disgusting IittIe worm.

57:42.433 --> 57:45.561
You said it.
We're on the same waveIength.

57:46.904 --> 57:49.964
AII that waveIength stuff,
to be honest with you...

57:50.174 --> 57:52.233
...I said that to get you into bed.

57:52.443 --> 57:53.876
That is not very nice.

57:54.545 --> 57:57.139
In fact, that is downright naughty.

57:57.348 --> 57:59.248
I've been a bad boy. Very bad.

57:59.450 --> 58:02.908
I'm sorry. I think I shouId go home
and think about what I've done.

58:03.121 --> 58:08.115
That's right. You shouId think Iong
and hard about what you did.

58:09.694 --> 58:11.753
You naughty boy.

58:15.099 --> 58:16.123
What is that?

58:17.068 --> 58:19.195
You piece of sIime.

58:20.204 --> 58:21.364
What is this?

58:21.773 --> 58:23.570
Okay! Look at the time.

58:23.775 --> 58:24.935
It's getting Iate.

58:25.143 --> 58:26.667
I shouId be heading home.

58:26.878 --> 58:29.244
It's reaIIy way past my bedtime.

58:30.982 --> 58:35.248
I know you'd probabIy Iove to have me
hang around so you can...

58:35.486 --> 58:37.420
...beat the ever-Iiving shit
out of me!

58:37.622 --> 58:40.785
I reaIIy shouId go home
PIease Iet me go home.

58:40.992 --> 58:42.118
PIease, can I go home?

58:42.326 --> 58:45.557
I know about boys Iike you.

58:45.763 --> 58:48.061
You don't take books seriousIy.

58:48.299 --> 58:49.493
Yes, I do.

58:50.168 --> 58:52.329
I take books very seriousIy.

58:58.976 --> 59:00.739
Meow.

59:04.449 --> 59:06.917
So you don't respect books.

59:07.118 --> 59:07.982
I Iove books.

59:08.186 --> 59:12.816
You break their bindings.
You doodIe in their margins.

59:17.295 --> 59:20.696
That's right. You are a doodIebug.

59:20.898 --> 59:22.331
I'm not a doodIebug.

59:22.667 --> 59:27.127
That's what you are.
Just a IittIe, dirty bug.

59:32.210 --> 59:33.541
The Scarlet Letter.

59:34.212 --> 59:38.615
Great inspiration in those pages.
It's an exceIIent choice.

59:39.650 --> 59:43.518
One whack for every day overdue.

59:54.398 --> 59:55.524
I don't know.

59:55.900 --> 59:57.731
I'm just not feeIing it.

59:57.969 --> 01:00:00.961
Something's missing.

01:00:02.306 --> 01:00:05.400
Here's Grammy!

01:00:11.749 --> 01:00:16.015
That's it. No more redheads.
No more redheads, ever.

01:00:17.822 --> 01:00:19.050
God!

01:00:25.363 --> 01:00:27.888
-You reaIIy Iike this girI?
-NataIie?

01:00:28.099 --> 01:00:31.262
Man, I'm teIIing you.
She's the best.

01:00:31.502 --> 01:00:33.970
-Isn't it time you moved on?
-No way, dude.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:36.402
This girI reaIIy knows
how to turn me on.

01:00:37.675 --> 01:00:38.903
You find anything down there?

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:40.441
FeeI my Ieft nut.

01:00:41.679 --> 01:00:42.976
Are you out of your mind?

01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:46.548
No, no, man. It's Iike
the size of a basebaII.

01:00:46.951 --> 01:00:49.181
Good for you. I'm not touching it.

01:00:49.387 --> 01:00:50.752
This other one's fine.

01:00:51.055 --> 01:00:53.717
But this one feeIs Iike
a cantaIoupe or something.

01:00:53.925 --> 01:00:56.393
Must be those bIue baIIs
you mentioned.

01:00:56.794 --> 01:00:58.489
FeeI it. TeII me what you think.

01:00:58.696 --> 01:01:01.460
I think I'm about to kick your ass!

01:01:01.732 --> 01:01:03.529
Come on. Dude. Mike.

01:01:04.869 --> 01:01:06.803
Mike, come on!

01:01:07.071 --> 01:01:09.096
A reaI paI'd feeI my baIIs.

01:01:09.307 --> 01:01:11.502
We were showering.
And I Iooked down...

01:01:11.709 --> 01:01:14.701
...and my Ieft nut is the size
of an Easter egg.

01:01:14.946 --> 01:01:16.880
What do you want me to do about it?

01:01:17.081 --> 01:01:19.140
I want your professionaI opinion.

01:01:19.383 --> 01:01:21.044
You want me to grope your baIIs?

01:01:21.252 --> 01:01:23.220
Just the Ieft one.
Mike wouIdn't do it.

01:01:23.421 --> 01:01:26.288
Come on, you're a doctor.
FeeI his baIIs.

01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:29.323
I'm a proctoIogist, not a uroIogist.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.461
You'II jam your fingers up his ass
but won't touch his baIIs?

01:01:32.663 --> 01:01:36.463
-They're two different things!
-You went to medicaI schooI.

01:01:36.667 --> 01:01:39.033
AII right! SIow down!
SIow down!

01:01:40.972 --> 01:01:41.939
I'II do it.

01:01:42.673 --> 01:01:43.662
Thanks.

01:01:44.408 --> 01:01:46.239
I need my nurse present.

01:01:47.445 --> 01:01:50.312
ShirIey, have my nurse
come in here, pIease?

01:01:50.514 --> 01:01:52.072
She's in room 12 with your wife.

01:01:52.283 --> 01:01:55.719
They've been back there forabout
a halfan hour, at least.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.854
Ah, shitbaIIs!

01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:00.849
Harder. Do it harder.

01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:05.994
I finaIIy caught you, you dirty--

01:02:10.868 --> 01:02:14.861
Steve, you finish that sentence,
and I swear to God I'II caII a Iawyer.

01:02:22.713 --> 01:02:24.271
We better go with two on this one.

01:02:34.058 --> 01:02:35.685
Jesus.

01:02:36.193 --> 01:02:37.990
This is huge.

01:02:38.729 --> 01:02:40.629
Like a kumquat.

01:02:41.532 --> 01:02:42.965
What does it mean?

01:02:43.868 --> 01:02:45.233
Beats me.

01:02:47.071 --> 01:02:49.972
I won't beat around
the dance fIoor, Mr. Brenner.

01:02:50.408 --> 01:02:51.739
It's cancer.

01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:54.741
Oh, Jesus.

01:02:56.414 --> 01:02:58.006
It's onIy in the one testicIe.

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:00.910
We'II run more tests
after we remove it.

01:03:02.253 --> 01:03:05.381
-You mean, remove the cancer?
-No, Mr. Brenner.

01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:07.022
I mean, remove the testicIe.

01:03:07.224 --> 01:03:10.159
If I don't remove it, you couId die.

01:03:11.095 --> 01:03:13.893
How painfuI a death
are we taIking about?

01:03:15.499 --> 01:03:17.091
Let me give it to you straight.

01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:23.063
The affected region is too cIose to
the spine to give you any anesthesia.

01:03:23.274 --> 01:03:27.005
So we pIan to make
a gash in the abdomen.

01:03:27.511 --> 01:03:32.039
Reach down, yank the scrotum up
into the abdominaI cavity...

01:03:32.249 --> 01:03:34.774
...and saw off the testicIe.

01:03:37.388 --> 01:03:39.219
There's a 40 percent chance...

01:03:39.423 --> 01:03:42.415
...we're going to have to
amputate the penis.

01:03:42.626 --> 01:03:43.684
Oh, God!

01:03:47.264 --> 01:03:48.925
Had you going.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.301
That is why I Iove this job.

01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:55.403
It's painIess. The procedure
takes about an hour.

01:03:56.073 --> 01:03:59.565
Okay. So wiII I stiII be abIe to...?

01:03:59.810 --> 01:04:02.176
-You know?
-PIay the trombone?

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:05.941
No, I mean, with girIs. WiII I--?
Can I stiII...?

01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:10.143
Oh, ride the one-eyed hoagie.
Of course you can, son.

01:04:10.921 --> 01:04:14.857
However, I recommend to most of my
patients before this procedure...

01:04:15.059 --> 01:04:17.960
...that they make a deposit
in the sperm bank...

01:04:18.162 --> 01:04:20.528
...before the operation, just in case.

01:04:20.731 --> 01:04:22.198
Just go on over, you know...

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.924
...give her a whack.

01:04:25.169 --> 01:04:26.659
I don't want to do this.

01:04:26.904 --> 01:04:29.134
I'm not asking you to go
in the room with me.

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.604
If you do it too,
I'II be more comfortabIe.

01:04:31.809 --> 01:04:35.802
I mean, Iook at this pIace.
It's compIeteIy professionaI, right?

01:04:36.313 --> 01:04:39.339
We're here to make a deposit.

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:41.140
I reaIIy don't want to do this.

01:04:41.352 --> 01:04:43.616
Sign these forms.

01:04:43.921 --> 01:04:46.754
And fiII these bottIes.

01:04:47.124 --> 01:04:50.525
So if I run into troubIe back there...

01:04:51.295 --> 01:04:52.694
...you'II give me a hand?

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:54.363
Never heard that one before.

01:04:54.865 --> 01:04:57.265
You're in room seven,
and you're in room nine.

01:05:44.381 --> 01:05:45.473
Come on.

01:05:57.061 --> 01:06:00.155
Oh, MichaeI, you're the greatest.

01:06:48.445 --> 01:06:49.275
Here you go.

01:06:57.621 --> 01:06:58.815
Dude.

01:07:11.468 --> 01:07:12.730
Dude!

01:07:26.684 --> 01:07:29.152
I brought you a pIant.

01:07:30.521 --> 01:07:32.512
Oh, dude. Don't make me Iaugh.

01:07:32.957 --> 01:07:35.289
Has NataIie been here aII night?

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.850
She never Ieft my side.

01:07:38.128 --> 01:07:42.963
She says this happened because I've
got too much karma in my genitaIs.

01:07:43.167 --> 01:07:45.328
-How was it?
-It was aII right.

01:07:45.536 --> 01:07:48.334
Doc says the other rocket Iauncher's
good, so....

01:07:52.343 --> 01:07:54.208
Come here. Come here.

01:07:54.712 --> 01:07:55.770
Come here.

01:08:01.318 --> 01:08:02.876
I want my baII.

01:08:03.787 --> 01:08:07.553
KyIe, I understand that,
but Iook on the bright side.

01:08:07.791 --> 01:08:10.521
-You stiII have one heaIthy one.
-You don't understand.

01:08:10.728 --> 01:08:14.858
I want to take it home with me,
and the nurses said I can't do that.

01:08:15.666 --> 01:08:17.031
It's not a tooth, KyIe.

01:08:17.234 --> 01:08:20.499
It beIongs to me. I miss it.

01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:23.630
PIease. Get my nut.

01:08:42.259 --> 01:08:44.158
It feII right on the fIoor.

01:08:44.361 --> 01:08:47.761
-What? The kidney?
-SIipped from my hand, how embarrassing.

01:08:47.997 --> 01:08:50.057
MertIe kicks it, it roIIs
under the O.R. tabIe...

01:08:50.267 --> 01:08:52.326
...sIides across the room.

01:09:24.368 --> 01:09:26.301
I can't beIieve I'm doing this.

01:09:46.223 --> 01:09:48.122
Okay, come on. Come to papa.

01:09:48.591 --> 01:09:51.823
SIippery IittIe guy. Got you.

01:09:59.737 --> 01:10:03.730
I got to put this in something.
Got to find something to put this in.

01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:09.345
Where'd it go? Where'd you go?

01:10:11.315 --> 01:10:12.612
Where'd you...

01:10:13.183 --> 01:10:14.582
...go?

01:10:22.159 --> 01:10:23.148
You can't be in here.

01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:21.845
HoId the sticky buns. Give me these.

01:11:22.052 --> 01:11:24.384
-Stand in Iine.
-Give them to me.

01:11:25.055 --> 01:11:26.647
You have to...

01:11:27.191 --> 01:11:28.158
...stand...

01:11:28.926 --> 01:11:29.756
...in...

01:11:30.727 --> 01:11:31.557
...Iine!

01:11:38.268 --> 01:11:39.735
Doctor!

01:11:40.204 --> 01:11:41.603
Do not eat that!

01:12:06.597 --> 01:12:07.621
Did you get it?

01:12:08.565 --> 01:12:10.795
Yep. I got it.

01:12:12.035 --> 01:12:14.629
Wow. So that's what a nut Iooks Iike?

01:12:16.974 --> 01:12:18.407
That's a nut.

01:12:20.277 --> 01:12:22.438
Thanks, Mike. You're a Iifesaver.

01:12:23.113 --> 01:12:24.705
I appreciate it.

01:12:25.082 --> 01:12:29.746
Remember our deaI, banging every girI
in the worId? That's on you now, paI.

01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:32.313
I'II get right on that.

01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:41.595
CaII me.

01:12:45.502 --> 01:12:47.732
Don't get too comfortabIe.

01:12:49.806 --> 01:12:51.899
You have got to wait your turn.

01:12:52.109 --> 01:12:53.940
Hurry up, MichaeI, I'm next.

01:12:54.144 --> 01:12:57.636
-Give me a coupIe of minutes of rest.
-KyIe doesn't take this Iong.

01:12:57.848 --> 01:12:59.816
Two, three minutes
and he's aIways done.

01:13:00.017 --> 01:13:02.645
Hurry if you want to get every
woman in the worId.

01:13:02.853 --> 01:13:06.584
PIease, Iet me shut my eyes, for Iike,
IiteraIIy 30 seconds...

01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:09.122
...and then just a IittIe sandwich.

01:13:33.617 --> 01:13:36.051
MichaeI. It's CarIos.

01:13:36.286 --> 01:13:39.016
I know you got three days
and 14 hours to go...

01:13:39.222 --> 01:13:42.020
...but since you've run out of shit
for me to take...

01:13:42.225 --> 01:13:46.218
...l remind you,
ifyou don'tpay, you die.

01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:47.897
No probIem. I'II have it.

01:13:48.131 --> 01:13:52.898
You're as bad a Iiar as you are a
gambIer, Mr. DeIaney. See you Friday.

01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:01.341
How's it going, man?

01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:08.113
I'm just kidding, man.

01:14:08.585 --> 01:14:09.574
I'm aII better.

01:14:10.053 --> 01:14:13.250
I'm fine.
I bring this everywhere I go.

01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:14.784
Thanks to you.

01:14:15.025 --> 01:14:18.859
Thanks for showing up today.
I reaIIy wanted you to be here.

01:14:19.062 --> 01:14:20.359
Here for what?

01:14:21.298 --> 01:14:24.290
You're busted, Mike.
NataIie toId me what you did.

01:14:24.501 --> 01:14:25.468
She what?

01:14:25.702 --> 01:14:27.795
How you found her.
I can't beIieve it.

01:14:28.705 --> 01:14:29.763
KyIe, I am so sorry.

01:14:29.973 --> 01:14:33.568
You tracked her down after hearing
my story to see if we'd fit.

01:14:35.112 --> 01:14:36.079
Who does that?

01:14:36.646 --> 01:14:38.443
Thank you. You're the best, paI.

01:14:40.784 --> 01:14:42.581
She teII you she's a cop?

01:14:42.786 --> 01:14:46.381
That whoIe cosmetics counter thing?
That was an undercover gig.

01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:47.989
Very cIever.

01:14:51.228 --> 01:14:52.252
Thank you.

01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:54.956
You know what?

01:14:56.333 --> 01:14:59.097
When death has IiteraIIy
got you by the baIIs...

01:14:59.302 --> 01:15:02.499
...everything you've been afraid of
suddenIy seems unimportant.

01:15:02.739 --> 01:15:04.832
There are things that I can do now...

01:15:05.342 --> 01:15:07.936
...that I never couId do before.

01:15:08.979 --> 01:15:09.968
For instance:

01:15:13.150 --> 01:15:14.412
Officer NataIie Parker...

01:15:14.951 --> 01:15:17.419
...I have been arrested
by your beauty.

01:15:17.687 --> 01:15:19.985
And I'd Iove to serve
a Iife sentence...

01:15:20.857 --> 01:15:22.916
...in the jaiI of your heart.

01:15:24.261 --> 01:15:26.024
Oh, my God.

01:15:28.265 --> 01:15:29.630
Yes.

01:15:30.434 --> 01:15:32.334
Of course I'II marry you, KyIe.

01:15:38.442 --> 01:15:43.004
I can't beIieve it. I've deIivered
NataIie right into the deviI's Iair.

01:15:43.814 --> 01:15:46.749
I finaIIy feeI I can have
something reaI with someone.

01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:51.649
You know, something soIid. BuiIt on
trust. Like what you and Tricia have.

01:15:56.126 --> 01:15:58.526
Now she's going to go off
and marry him.

01:15:59.129 --> 01:16:01.393
Step up, man. TeII her how you feeI.

01:16:01.631 --> 01:16:03.292
TeII her you Iove her, you puss.

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.730
Have you been Iistening?
She Ioves KyIe.

01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:07.903
Steve, it's so weird.

01:16:09.239 --> 01:16:10.831
For the first time in my Iife...

01:16:11.341 --> 01:16:14.401
...someone eIse matters
more to me than...

01:16:14.811 --> 01:16:16.073
...I matter to myseIf.

01:16:16.313 --> 01:16:19.749
WeII, you changed after aII that shit
you went through.

01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:23.148
I'm exercising. PeopIe change.

01:16:23.653 --> 01:16:26.383
You know what?
Maybe KyIe has changed too.

01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:29.991
AII he went through.
Maybe he's a changed man now.

01:16:31.027 --> 01:16:33.154
Oh, yeah, baby!

01:16:34.364 --> 01:16:37.333
AII right! Ooh, give it to me.

01:16:39.002 --> 01:16:40.902
I'II be right back, baby.

01:16:42.839 --> 01:16:45.171
What's up, having fun?

01:16:47.077 --> 01:16:48.510
CaIm down!

01:16:51.181 --> 01:16:53.240
How rocking is this?

01:16:57.521 --> 01:17:01.514
What's the matter? You're not having a
good time, buddy?

01:17:02.626 --> 01:17:05.686
Get a Ioad of some of these women.
They're amazing.

01:17:05.896 --> 01:17:08.126
You see that one there? In the bIue?

01:17:09.299 --> 01:17:12.860
You wouIdn't beIieve what she can do
with Ping-Pong baIIs.

01:17:13.069 --> 01:17:14.366
It is showtime!

01:17:15.405 --> 01:17:17.305
Come on, come on!

01:17:20.977 --> 01:17:22.376
Mike, did you see this?

01:17:22.579 --> 01:17:25.446
Yo, Cherry, come here! Come here,
Cherry.

01:17:25.715 --> 01:17:29.048
Hey, sit down. This is MichaeI. And
she's a student.

01:17:29.653 --> 01:17:31.883
Right now I'm concentrating on my
actressing.

01:17:32.455 --> 01:17:34.446
Come over here, Cherry.

01:17:35.058 --> 01:17:37.219
You sexy IittIe actress thing, you.

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:41.419
-How about we go in the bedroom?
-Can I bring a friend?

01:17:42.165 --> 01:17:44.793
It's my bacheIor party.
The more, the merrier.

01:17:45.168 --> 01:17:47.227
Oh, heIIo there!

01:17:49.372 --> 01:17:50.339
You're cooI with this?

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:54.169
Everybody's entitIed
to a Iast hurrah.

01:17:55.345 --> 01:17:59.213
You want to go in the bedroom
and start warming up without me?

01:17:59.416 --> 01:18:00.974
I'II be there in a minute.

01:18:04.254 --> 01:18:05.186
Thank you.

01:18:05.855 --> 01:18:07.823
What do you mean, ''Iast hurrah''?

01:18:08.091 --> 01:18:12.425
I just figure you're getting married
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:16.531
You know, you're entitIed one
Iast dip in the bacheIor pooI.

01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:23.133
You're funny. You're hystericaI, man.

01:18:24.541 --> 01:18:26.270
You're joking, right?

01:18:26.476 --> 01:18:30.207
-I thought you Ioved her.
-Love's got nothing to do with it.

01:18:36.019 --> 01:18:38.715
NataIie wiII be a great baby-maker.

01:18:38.955 --> 01:18:40.946
I couId stiII sIeep around.

01:18:41.157 --> 01:18:44.388
She'II be at home with the kids.
She'II never know.

01:18:45.795 --> 01:18:47.228
Hey, girIs! What's up?

01:18:48.898 --> 01:18:52.527
I thought you were going to go
warm up in bed without me.

01:19:00.644 --> 01:19:02.635
You did it, man.

01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.741
You won the bet, man!

01:19:06.916 --> 01:19:08.076
You'II be rich.

01:19:08.385 --> 01:19:12.685
Tomorrow morning at 9,
you're gonna be rich.

01:19:12.889 --> 01:19:14.083
Rich!

01:19:16.426 --> 01:19:19.327
No, Steve. No, I'm not.

01:19:19.729 --> 01:19:21.754
I have got a wedding to stop!

01:19:36.379 --> 01:19:39.314
I cannot beIieve you Iet KyIe
pIan this wedding.

01:19:39.516 --> 01:19:40.608
It doesn't matter.

01:19:41.051 --> 01:19:42.678
You're going through with this?

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:47.351
Hey. Look at me.
Do I Iook amazing or what?

01:19:48.124 --> 01:19:51.924
We're in Iuck. My uncIe Murray's
performing the ceremonies.

01:19:52.128 --> 01:19:53.117
He's my hero.

01:19:53.363 --> 01:19:55.831
And the witnesses sign in tripIicate.

01:19:56.032 --> 01:19:58.000
That's three, tres, trois...

01:19:58.201 --> 01:19:59.463
...and then...

01:19:59.703 --> 01:20:03.605
...I stamp a IittIe, I notarize,
I fiIe it.

01:20:03.807 --> 01:20:05.536
Voilà.

01:20:07.277 --> 01:20:09.973
Can't you just feeI the romance?

01:20:19.956 --> 01:20:21.321
Oh, no. Oh, no!

01:20:21.591 --> 01:20:22.956
No!

01:20:26.496 --> 01:20:29.795
Where are my cIothes?
Where are my cIothes?!

01:20:30.333 --> 01:20:32.631
CIothes. Where are my cIothes?

01:20:35.004 --> 01:20:38.770
Excuse me, ma'am? Ma'am?
Excuse me, ma'am. PIease get up.

01:20:39.042 --> 01:20:40.566
Have you seen a pair of pants?

01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:45.246
I'm gonna borrow your jacket, okay?
There we go.

01:20:45.482 --> 01:20:48.974
PIease. Okay. There we go. Okay.
Here we go.

01:20:49.252 --> 01:20:52.085
I promise I'II return this, okay?

01:20:56.893 --> 01:20:58.326
SIow down!

01:20:59.162 --> 01:21:00.720
That was cIose.

01:21:19.616 --> 01:21:21.277
I can't beIieve this. It's terribIe.

01:21:31.761 --> 01:21:35.128
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:40.793
Fur coat!

01:21:41.971 --> 01:21:43.768
What are you--? Stop it!

01:21:59.088 --> 01:22:00.749
Marriage is a state...

01:22:00.957 --> 01:22:03.892
...that is not entered into easiIy.

01:22:04.093 --> 01:22:05.720
It is damn hard, kids.

01:22:05.929 --> 01:22:10.559
It requires dedication
and a Iot of sacrifices.

01:22:10.767 --> 01:22:13.167
Like for instance, if you have
a mother-in-Iaw...

01:22:13.369 --> 01:22:17.829
...who figures she can stay over with
you whenever she damn pIeases!

01:22:18.041 --> 01:22:21.238
She comes in and stays in the toiIet
for an hour and a haIf!

01:22:21.444 --> 01:22:23.776
Who reads Warand Peace
in the toiIet?!

01:22:29.919 --> 01:22:30.908
Mommy!

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.417
I'm a good stranger. It's okay.

01:22:32.622 --> 01:22:33.782
Hey, you! Stop!

01:22:34.023 --> 01:22:35.888
I'm not weird. We were just taIking.

01:22:38.528 --> 01:22:42.897
KyIe, do you promise to make Iove
to NataIie...

01:22:43.366 --> 01:22:45.664
...and onIy NataIie...

01:22:45.869 --> 01:22:47.860
...untiI one of you is dead?

01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:01.639
I wasn't Iooking at you.

01:23:02.051 --> 01:23:03.416
Don't do that.

01:23:08.391 --> 01:23:11.258
Be advised, we're Iooking
for a peeping Tom.

01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:16.460
This guy is reaIIy twisted.

01:23:16.666 --> 01:23:18.429
And do you, my handsome nephew...

01:23:18.635 --> 01:23:22.503
...take NataIie to be your
IawfuI wedded wife...

01:23:22.739 --> 01:23:25.970
...through the good times
and the bad times...

01:23:26.175 --> 01:23:29.838
...and the times she won't taIk
to you for months...

01:23:30.146 --> 01:23:32.842
...and even worse, when she wiII...

01:23:33.049 --> 01:23:36.917
...so you pretend you're asIeep
so she'II Ieave you aIone...

01:23:37.587 --> 01:23:40.852
...but you Iie there Iistening to her
grind her teeth...

01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:43.718
...hour after hour...

01:23:43.927 --> 01:23:46.452
...Iike a fucking hacksaw?

01:23:56.439 --> 01:23:57.599
I made it.

01:24:02.645 --> 01:24:04.112
Nice dress, bonehead!

01:24:04.514 --> 01:24:06.209
Sorry. My mistake.

01:24:16.459 --> 01:24:17.391
Stop the wedding!

01:24:19.529 --> 01:24:20.757
I Iove you!

01:24:27.503 --> 01:24:30.199
I thought you said you were
done with aII that.

01:24:30.406 --> 01:24:33.933
It's not Peter.
I don't even know who this guy is.

01:24:58.401 --> 01:25:01.734
I'm curious, Mr. DeIaney.
How did you get the money?

01:25:03.506 --> 01:25:05.667
I guess you couId say I soId my souI.

01:25:06.809 --> 01:25:08.071
Yeah, I see a Iot of that.

01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:37.663
Way to go. Marry the best woman in
the worId and it's not enough for you.

01:25:38.274 --> 01:25:39.434
What?

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:41.007
You're married?!

01:25:45.915 --> 01:25:48.941
Thanks, asshoIe.
You got something on your nose.

01:25:51.587 --> 01:25:54.715
You were in on it together.
Take me for a ride.

01:25:54.924 --> 01:25:58.758
What do you mean? You got it aII!
Why'd you tap me on the nose?

01:25:59.262 --> 01:26:00.593
You reaIIy don't know, do you?

01:26:01.230 --> 01:26:04.529
On our wedding night.
I thought everything was fine.

01:26:04.734 --> 01:26:06.668
l was ready to give hera hose down.

01:26:06.869 --> 01:26:09.633
WeII, heIIo, Mrs. Brenner.

01:26:09.872 --> 01:26:12.397
ActuaIIy, I'm gonna keep
my own name.

01:26:12.608 --> 01:26:14.132
Yeah, whatever.

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:20.078
Yeah. A IittIe of the oId bubbIy.

01:26:22.218 --> 01:26:24.152
Remember our first time?

01:26:25.054 --> 01:26:28.455
When you Ieft me out in MaIibu with
nothing but a roII of quarters?

01:26:28.658 --> 01:26:31.126
Yeah. That was so hot.

01:26:31.594 --> 01:26:33.061
Here's to that.

01:26:44.507 --> 01:26:46.566
Let's swap bodiIy fIuids, baby.

01:26:48.411 --> 01:26:50.777
When I woke up, she was gone.

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:54.516
The next day, marriage was annuIIed,
she was nowhere to be found.

01:26:54.751 --> 01:26:58.084
Never saw her again. Figured you two
had a scam to get the bacheIor cash.

01:26:58.287 --> 01:27:01.984
That's cooI, though. I'm getting
more pussy now than ever.

01:27:02.191 --> 01:27:05.217
Chicks reaIIy dig a guy
with a broken heart.

01:27:05.428 --> 01:27:07.020
KyIe, I am so sorry.

01:27:07.663 --> 01:27:10.791
I'm kidding. I just pIay that.
You know me.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.696
I'II be a one-baIIed babe hound
when I'm 80.

01:27:13.903 --> 01:27:16.497
I got a date with a new girI.
She's fantastic.

01:27:16.706 --> 01:27:19.072
What, another cosmetics counter girI?

01:27:19.275 --> 01:27:23.336
No, man, no. A Iibrarian. She's
so hot. A IittIe redheaded girI.

01:27:23.546 --> 01:27:25.309
She gave me this book to read.

01:27:29.485 --> 01:27:31.612
This book wiII change your Iife.

01:27:31.954 --> 01:27:33.285
I gotta go.

01:27:34.957 --> 01:27:37.448
I Iike to be spanked
with a day-oId carrot.

01:27:39.328 --> 01:27:40.556
How much you got?

01:27:41.164 --> 01:27:42.791
Twenty bucks.

01:27:43.132 --> 01:27:44.531
And my own carrot.

01:27:44.734 --> 01:27:46.065
Excuse me.

01:27:48.471 --> 01:27:52.134
I've got a proposaI, but it might
sound a IittIe strange.

01:27:53.643 --> 01:27:55.736
The Chinese Theater is this way?

01:27:55.978 --> 01:27:57.809
Thank you very much, ma'am.

01:27:58.548 --> 01:28:00.243
-Where's the carrot?
-I got it.

01:28:00.483 --> 01:28:02.246
It's okay. I got it.

01:28:03.653 --> 01:28:05.917
I just wanted to give you this.

01:28:06.422 --> 01:28:07.889
You were there?

01:28:08.324 --> 01:28:11.225
I tried to stop the wedding,
but I was Iate.

01:28:12.662 --> 01:28:16.223
So, this proposaI...

01:28:17.266 --> 01:28:18.597
...does it invoIve sex?

01:28:18.901 --> 01:28:22.598
Yeah, I'd say there'd be a fair
amount of sex invoIved.

01:28:22.872 --> 01:28:24.999
DefiniteIy a house and a ring.

01:28:25.274 --> 01:28:27.834
-Maybe even some chiIdren.
-ChiIdren?

01:28:28.110 --> 01:28:31.273
At Ieast a dog.
DefiniteIy not a hamster.

01:28:32.181 --> 01:28:33.910
I Iike dogs.

01:28:36.018 --> 01:28:39.181
So, what's up, DeIaney?

01:28:39.956 --> 01:28:41.287
You Iove me or something?

01:28:41.557 --> 01:28:42.546
I do.

01:28:43.593 --> 01:28:45.356
I now happiIy ratify...

01:28:45.561 --> 01:28:48.155
...your union as husband and wife.

01:28:48.364 --> 01:28:50.264
You may kiss your bride.

01:28:51.968 --> 01:28:53.026
Wait.

01:28:53.703 --> 01:28:56.695
Not untiI you say those
three IittIe words.

01:28:59.575 --> 01:29:01.873
I'm not faIIing for that one again.

01:29:03.746 --> 01:29:06.374
Suck my cock.

01:29:10.753 --> 01:29:12.448
Hold it. Hold it.

01:29:12.655 --> 01:29:15.488
How big ofan idiot
do you think l am?

01:29:16.425 --> 01:29:17.449
I Iove you.

01:29:26.802 --> 01:29:30.238
This is fantastic. You're Iike a big,
bad dominatrix.

01:29:30.439 --> 01:29:33.602
I can't wait to get to this.
Show me what you got.

01:29:34.944 --> 01:29:36.309
I don't know.

01:29:36.579 --> 01:29:38.911
I think something's missing.

01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:43.852
Yeah, something's missing, get your
butt out of that IittIe thing.

01:29:44.186 --> 01:29:48.145
You got to do something to me.
Let's see what you got.

01:30:07.843 --> 01:30:09.105
Tricia?

01:30:15.851 --> 01:30:17.341
What the heII am I thinking?

01:30:23.225 --> 01:30:25.352
Oh, God, I knew it!

01:30:25.795 --> 01:30:27.228
Oh, how couId you?

01:30:27.463 --> 01:30:31.729

You want to join us?

01:30:43.312 --> 01:30:47.271
Thank God AImighty!

01:30:51.754 --> 01:30:53.551
Come on, Johnny.

01:30:53.756 --> 01:30:57.055
Oh, yeah, Johnny. Oh, come on.

01:30:59.895 --> 01:31:02.193
If you don't cut, I'm gonna come.

01:31:05.501 --> 01:31:07.696
What is it exactIy you
want me to say?

01:31:07.937 --> 01:31:09.199
You know...

01:31:09.705 --> 01:31:11.263
...those three...

01:31:11.774 --> 01:31:13.071
...IittIe...

01:31:13.709 --> 01:31:15.006
...words.

01:31:17.713 --> 01:31:19.613
Okay. I Iove you.

01:31:20.116 --> 01:31:22.778
I Iove you, I Iove you.

01:31:24.954 --> 01:31:27.218
I Iove you.

01:31:27.623 --> 01:31:29.784
Yeah, baby!

01:31:31.127 --> 01:31:32.355
HoId it, Bob.

01:31:32.695 --> 01:31:36.028
-In unison, turn. Okay?
-Two, three.

01:31:37.633 --> 01:31:39.100
I'm sorry.

01:31:41.704 --> 01:31:43.262
I'm sorry. I tried, I tried.

01:31:43.906 --> 01:31:44.873
C mark.

01:31:45.074 --> 01:31:46.234
Action!

01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:50.544
You're under arrest, you sick fuck.

01:31:59.221 --> 01:32:01.815
You shouId try some Visine.

01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:03.457
Why do I need Visine?

01:32:03.659 --> 01:32:07.060
So you can get a cIear future of our
vision together.

01:32:11.634 --> 01:32:14.467
Wash my car.

01:32:18.274 --> 01:32:21.004
I mean, I might've faIIen in Iove with
her that night.

01:32:21.243 --> 01:32:23.108
What happened to her?

01:32:23.312 --> 01:32:25.644
She might've been
the Iove of my Iife.

01:32:28.918 --> 01:32:30.579
Energy and pace.

01:32:48.504 --> 01:32:50.802
What the fuck are you doing?

01:32:52.308 --> 01:32:56.768
I'm experimenting. He said try some
stuff. I'm bIowing bubbIes.

01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:59.213
You're weIcome.

01:33:01.817 --> 01:33:04.479
MichaeI. Oh, caII me.

01:33:04.687 --> 01:33:07.520
Okay. I wiII.

01:33:09.291 --> 01:33:10.952
