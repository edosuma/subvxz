[growls]

00:31.781 --> 00:33.450
Enough hiding, Nari.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.452
This ends now.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.203
You're <i>not</i> taking her.

You're going down, buttsnacks!

No!

No, no, no. No, no, no! No!

01:19.621 --> 01:20.455
[creaks]

01:21.956 --> 01:26.002
[yelling] Claire! Steve! Nari!
What happened here?

01:26.086 --> 01:28.129
-[Krel groans]
-Krel! No.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.297
[Krel moans]

01:29.923 --> 01:32.050
Oof! Couldn't stop them.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.470
-Took Nari. Oh, wait!
-[Dadblank babbling]

01:36.971 --> 01:38.890
-He can show you.
-[buzzing]

01:39.474 --> 01:41.935
Wahoo! How are you, buckaroo?

01:43.436 --> 01:44.354
[yelling]

01:45.230 --> 01:47.148
[Krel screaming on recording] <i>Oof!</i>

01:47.232 --> 01:48.441
[screaming]

01:49.567 --> 01:51.277
[Claire screaming, Blinky yells]

01:51.694 --> 01:52.904

That's all, fo-- [whines] beep-boop...

02:02.580 --> 02:04.874
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
This wasn't supposed to happen!

02:05.041 --> 02:06.251
[clatters]

02:07.001 --> 02:09.963
No! Oh, please tell me
there's something in here to help.

02:10.046 --> 02:13.216
You don't need the book
to tell you the answer, Doux.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.384
Merlin was clear.

02:14.801 --> 02:18.388
If the Order has Nari,
we can't let them get the Seals,

02:18.471 --> 02:20.348
or it's arcane Armageddon.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.684
But I can't just leave our friends to die.

02:23.017 --> 02:24.769
It's not easy being a leader.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.897
[Archie] The Order will never stop
coming after the Seals.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.649
We'll spend the rest of our lives running.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.985
Save our friends or save the world?

02:32.402 --> 02:34.404
You have to make a decision.

02:35.572 --> 02:36.614
[Krel] We're out of time!

02:38.032 --> 02:41.286
Or maybe... time is all we have.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.469
[Steve] What are you creepozoids
doing to Nari?

02:58.553 --> 03:01.514
Ensuring she won't leave us again.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.725
Morgana, help us.

03:03.808 --> 03:07.228
My sister only looks out for herself.

03:07.562 --> 03:10.023
She'd leave any of you for dead

03:10.106 --> 03:12.108
-if it meant her freedom.
-[scoffs]

03:12.191 --> 03:14.736
You don't know me at all, brother.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.196
My patience grows thin...

mortals.

03:18.406 --> 03:23.453
-[screams]
-Don't you realize you've already lost?

03:23.536 --> 03:28.291
Merlin is dead at the hands
of his greatest champion,

03:28.374 --> 03:33.004
and we turned his Trollhunter against you.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.674
Tell us where to find Merlin's errand boy

03:36.758 --> 03:38.718
or be turned to ash.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.638
Jim! I know you're in there!

03:41.804 --> 03:42.931
[Steve wails]

03:43.014 --> 03:45.850
Arcane Order, Hisirdoux is here!

03:46.976 --> 03:50.480
Ah-ah-ah-ah--!
Hold your hexes if you still want these.

03:50.980 --> 03:51.814
[Skrael gasps]

03:51.898 --> 03:54.525
The Genesis Seals.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.945
You want them?
Well, come and get them.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.279
I'll be at the cafe.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.782
[Bellroc sighs]

04:01.574 --> 04:03.201
[Bellroc] Secure Nari.

04:03.284 --> 04:08.081
And if the others give you
any trouble... kill them.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.123
[buzzing]

04:10.166 --> 04:11.751
Your designs were complicated,

04:11.834 --> 04:15.463
but I'm 98.442 percent sure
that this will work.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.048
-[buzzes]
-[chuckles]

04:17.131 --> 04:20.134
Akiridion tech and magic
are so compatible!

04:20.218 --> 04:21.344
Who would have thought?

04:21.844 --> 04:24.347
-[Archie] No turning back now.
-Wasn't planning on it.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.766
Arch, pass me those salad bowls,
then head out.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.309
-Krel, prep the airship.
-[grunts]

04:28.434 --> 04:32.313
I'll always follow you, Doux,
but this could be a huge mistake.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.649
"A wizard doesn't make mistakes--

04:34.732 --> 04:37.235
he makes unexpected possibilities."

[doorbell jingles]

04:45.118 --> 04:45.952
Hmm.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.415
[Douxie] Milords and ladies...

04:50.665 --> 04:51.916
gather round!

04:52.458 --> 04:54.836
Test your luck with the Lad of Fortune.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.422
Find the Seals, win the planet.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.134
Keep your eyes on the prize.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.932
[Douxie] Round and round it goes...

05:08.057 --> 05:08.891
Whoo!

05:09.142 --> 05:10.476
Now, choose.

05:11.936 --> 05:13.187
That one.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.481
Are you absolutely positive?

05:15.690 --> 05:18.901
Enough games!
We have made our choice.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.572
[Bellroc] Agh! What is this strangeness?

05:22.780 --> 05:24.574
It's a miniature Heart of Avalon.

05:24.782 --> 05:26.576
Scrapped it together
out of bits the old one.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.745

05:28.828 --> 05:31.414
"Hisirdoux's Eternal Time Trap!"

05:31.497 --> 05:34.625
[Bellroc]
You dare meddle with the forces of time?

05:34.709 --> 05:38.171
[Skrael] You lack the power to control
such an instrument.

05:38.254 --> 05:42.842
My whole life, people-- Arthur, Merlin,
you-- have been saying that.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.761
And I believed it, so I never tried.

05:45.094 --> 05:48.306
But my friends helped me realize
I <i>am</i> strong enough.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.682
[guitar chord rings]

05:49.974 --> 05:52.602
-I am Hisirdoux Casperan...

06:00.860 --> 06:02.570
You want the Seals? Go get 'em!

06:03.571 --> 06:05.281

[Toby] I'd hug ya,
but I can't move my arms.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.670
-[Claire] Where is the Arcane Order?
-[Douxie] I have them preoccupied.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.048
[gasps] What's the Queen
of the Apocalypse doing here?

08:27.381 --> 08:30.843
What I should have done long ago--
deal with my brother.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.094
[Morgana] Get your injured to safety.

08:33.930 --> 08:37.141

-They locked her up somewhere.

-Uh...

[Douxie] All right, everyone on board.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.875
Krel will take you down to Arcadia.

09:30.611 --> 09:33.364
I am immune to your majicks.

09:33.447 --> 09:37.034
True, but there's a force
neither of us can escape.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.573
We are almost free!

10:20.244 --> 10:23.831
[gasps] Where is the boy wizard?

10:23.914 --> 10:26.375
[Bellroc] He's after Nari!

10:30.129 --> 10:31.005

[Nari grunts] Oh, thank you.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.969
Though the Order
will surely rip your soul to pieces.

We need to work on your pep talks.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.432
[Archie] Douxie! Douxie!

10:41.932 --> 10:44.852
Seems the Order's back from time,
which means we're out of it.

10:44.935 --> 10:47.480
-Hurry!
-[Douxie] Nari, you must keep running.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.231
[Douxie] Never stop.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.650
[Douxie] You can't let the Arcane Order--

10:50.733 --> 10:52.068
-[Bellroc] Nari!
-[Douxie] --find you.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.945

11:16.050 --> 11:18.219
You will die for this!

11:18.386 --> 11:19.804
That was kind of the plan.

11:19.887 --> 11:23.391
But it was worth it so my friends--
and Nari-- could get away.

11:31.315 --> 11:34.402
Aaarrgghh remind Jim who he was.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.488
Master Jim, snap out of it!

11:37.571 --> 11:39.240
-We are your friends.

-[gasps]
-Why do you fight, sister?

12:54.440 --> 12:57.943
This is what you wanted--
to fix the world.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.362
The world isn't ours anymore.

13:00.446 --> 13:03.449
You have failed to destroy it.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.409
I have failed to save it.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.037
[Morgana] Perhaps they can fare better.

[Morgana groaning]

14:02.550 --> 14:04.051

You are a disgrace to Camelot's memory.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.182
You want Camelot back?

Wha...?

16:29.738 --> 16:30.823
[sighs]

16:30.906 --> 16:32.574
Mordrax's miracles!

16:32.658 --> 16:35.411
If this is the afterlife,
I must surely be in--

16:35.494 --> 16:38.288
-Hello there, boy.
-What?

16:38.539 --> 16:40.541
Master! You're-- you're not dead!

16:40.624 --> 16:41.709
[laughs]

16:41.792 --> 16:46.255
Magic may be mastery over life,
but I am most certainly deceased.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.298
You saw me vaporize into soot.

16:48.590 --> 16:52.302
The question really is...
why are <i>you</i> here?

16:52.553 --> 16:53.470
[Merlin] Hmm?

16:57.266 --> 16:59.768
I see you translated my grimoire.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.938
-You wrote it in Draconic!
-Ancient Draconic.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.940
You figured it out, didn't you?

17:05.024 --> 17:08.027
Though you somehow did the exact opposite

17:08.110 --> 17:12.114
of my <i>extremely</i> specific instructions.

17:12.197 --> 17:13.824
Wha--

17:13.907 --> 17:15.075
[laughs]

17:15.159 --> 17:17.161
Uh... I knew you wouldn't approve.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.414
But I came up with my own plan.
No regrets.

17:20.831 --> 17:25.627
Yes. I can see you no longer need
my validation.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.463
Remember when I told you

17:27.546 --> 17:30.883
that magic is mastery over life?

17:30.966 --> 17:34.178
Nine hundred years
you've guarded this realm.

17:34.261 --> 17:37.973
You've disrupted time,
freed ancient beasts,

17:38.223 --> 17:42.269
fought to save one life
at the risk of countless others

17:42.436 --> 17:46.190
because you believed
every life was precious.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.608
[Merlin] And still...

17:48.108 --> 17:51.278
despite such relentless hardships,

17:51.361 --> 17:53.989
you managed to protect
those dearest to you.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.410
My, Hisirdoux,

17:58.494 --> 18:00.913
what a life you've lived.

18:01.497 --> 18:05.292
-What a wizard you've become.
-[sobs]

18:11.256 --> 18:13.425
[sniffles, sobs]

18:17.096 --> 18:18.597
[sighing]

18:25.395 --> 18:27.481
[woman's voice] Time to be off, then.

18:27.731 --> 18:30.109
You were a foolish old man,

18:30.192 --> 18:33.195
but you had good taste in apprentices.

18:33.612 --> 18:34.780
Morgana?

18:36.907 --> 18:37.908
[sniffles]

18:49.586 --> 18:51.755
I'd say you have to join us,

18:51.839 --> 18:54.800
but you've never listened
to anyone else before,

18:54.883 --> 18:57.010
so why start now?

18:57.261 --> 19:00.889
Alas, I fear the age of wizardry
ends with us.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.726
But you will carry on in the world of man.

19:04.810 --> 19:08.105
You must protect Nari no matter what.

19:08.188 --> 19:10.816
-Promise me that. And don't...
-But, master!

19:11.024 --> 19:13.235
..."But, master" me.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.362
[chuckles]

19:16.280 --> 19:19.158
Good luck, Master Wizard.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.327
Safe travels, Master Wizards.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.166
Eh..?

19:27.416 --> 19:28.250
[all gasp]

19:28.333 --> 19:31.837
-Douxie! You brave, foolish boy.
-[Douxie groans]

19:32.588 --> 19:34.381
[groans] But everything hurts.

19:34.464 --> 19:35.883
I can't believe you're okay.

19:35.966 --> 19:39.303
Barely!
Seems <i>you're</i> the one with nine lives.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.096
And don't you ever do that again.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.265
-[Claire] Happy you're alive, Teach.
-[Steve] Yeah!

19:43.348 --> 19:47.394
[groaning] Easy.
I just came back from beyond the grave.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.730
But wait, where's Jim?

19:55.068 --> 19:58.405
Mordrax's miracles.
It seems I've missed a lot.

19:58.488 --> 20:00.490
Same, but glad to be back.

20:00.782 --> 20:02.201
What about Arthur?

20:02.284 --> 20:03.660
Squished.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.204
[Blinky] Indeed.

20:05.287 --> 20:08.790
And I'm afraid with their demise,
Excalibur...

20:08.874 --> 20:09.708
[gasps]

20:10.042 --> 20:12.252
[Toby] Is right over <i>here!</i>

20:12.336 --> 20:14.379
[grunting]

20:14.463 --> 20:15.923
Okay, I just had to try.

20:16.006 --> 20:18.133
What of you, Master Jim?

20:18.217 --> 20:20.010
-What?
-[Douxie] Jim, Blinky's right.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.722
With Arthur gone, someone needs
to wield Excalibur.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.225
Who better than the Trollhunter?

20:34.316 --> 20:36.151
[grunting]

20:37.986 --> 20:38.987
[sighs]

20:40.030 --> 20:41.615
But without the amulet,

20:42.407 --> 20:44.076
am I still the Trollhunter?

20:45.118 --> 20:46.578
This means nothing, Jim.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.164
If I've learned anything,
it's that we don't draw strength

20:49.248 --> 20:53.043
from magic artifacts
like amulets and swords.

20:53.126 --> 20:57.256
Our strength is something
far less enchanted, but no less special--

20:57.714 --> 20:58.924
our friends.

20:59.007 --> 21:02.135
We are the protectors of this world.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.680
[Douxie]
<i>That's why I made the gamble I did.</i>

21:04.763 --> 21:08.308
<i>Because the only way to stop</i>
<i>the Arcane Order and save this world</i>

21:08.392 --> 21:10.269
is to do it together.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.648
Are you sure <i>our</i> Douxie
came back from the dead?

21:14.731 --> 21:16.692
-[meows, purrs]
-This one is super sappy.

21:16.775 --> 21:17.901
Cheeky.

21:17.985 --> 21:18.986
[laughing]

21:21.321 --> 21:22.781
It's time Nari and I got a move on,

21:23.448 --> 21:26.285
-before the Order catches up.
-[Claire] You're leaving? Already?

21:26.368 --> 21:28.120
[Steve] Yeah, you just finished
a whole speech

21:28.203 --> 21:30.122
about saving the world together.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.416
-[grunts]
-[Jim] Where are you going?

21:32.499 --> 21:34.501
I promised Merlin I'd keep Nari safe,

21:34.584 --> 21:37.087
which means taking her far away from here.

21:37.170 --> 21:41.008
Don't worry, I'll be seeing
you champions of Arcadia soon enough.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.743
The world's gonna end!
We're all gonna die!

22:07.826 --> 22:08.660
[driver] Hey, look out!

22:08.744 --> 22:11.788
The world's gonna end!
We're all gonna die!

22:11.872 --> 22:12.706
[clatters]

22:12.789 --> 22:14.291
