- What kind of publicist
would I be if I wasn't

01:47.374 --> 01:49.708
at my client's
very first book signing?

01:49.743 --> 01:51.743

            - Yeah...

01:51.779 --> 01:54.279
               Excited, nervous,
        tempted to run and hide.

01:54.315 --> 01:57.783
- Don't be silly. Your book is
amazing! Read it twice already.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.618
           - Not even my mom
           has read it twice.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.621
- It's so relatable.
You put into writing

02:02.656 --> 02:04.623
everything my girlfriends and I
secretly talk about.

02:04.658 --> 02:07.025
             - Well, it is based
            on my real break-up.

02:07.061 --> 02:10.395
- I know! It's like you got
your heart broken just for us.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.197
And all the things
you did to move on.

02:12.233 --> 02:15.067
I mean, who goes skydiving
to get over a heartbreak?

02:15.102 --> 02:17.603
           - Just doing my part.

02:17.638 --> 02:21.707
It's going to be really great to
have a familiar face here today.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.376
- Let's get inside. This
"familiar face" is freezing.

02:24.411 --> 02:26.545
        - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:28.149 --> 02:31.416
       - So are you ready?
       - Uh, define ready.

02:31.452 --> 02:34.753
  - Just relax and be yourself.
        This will be fun.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.622
      - OK, but you're sure
    that I won't have to read

02:36.657 --> 02:38.724
or answer questions? Because I
really hate speaking in public.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.460
   - Which is why you'll only be
     signing copies of your book

02:41.495 --> 02:43.395
     until Elliot turns up.
            - Elliot?

02:43.430 --> 02:45.731
                     - Somersby.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.900
      Of the <i> Dread Monarch Saga.</i>

02:47.935 --> 02:49.968
    - Oh, right, the dragon guy.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.970
              - The best-selling
                     dragon guy.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.906
         I used the fact
  that he's one of our authors

02:53.941 --> 02:55.974
      to get you displayed
          next to him.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.610
    - I think the dragon ate
       part of my display.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.946
     - Well, if you're not happy
        with it, we can move it.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.448
- Oh no! Are you kidding me?
My book is on display

03:03.484 --> 03:05.517
in a real bookstore.
I think this is fantastic!

03:05.553 --> 03:07.486
               - Well, it's just
                  the beginning.

08:01.915 --> 08:05.383
- I mean, I could sign a copy
of my book for you if you want.

08:05.419 --> 08:08.587
        - I deserve that.
    - Uh, sorry to interrupt,

08:08.622 --> 08:10.889
               but this crowd is
              a little restless.

08:10.924 --> 08:14.826
    - Great. Um, such a pleasure
               to see you again.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.796
       - Well, thank you.
 - Cassie, I'm gonna read this.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.898
      - You don't have to.
        - No, I want to.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.267
        It was nice meeting you,
              new writer Cassie.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.805
               - Isn't he great?
            He's a major talent.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.408
  (cell phone musical ringtone)
   Sorry, I have to take this.

08:30.444 --> 08:34.179
         - How about I treat you
         to a celebratory latte?

08:34.214 --> 08:36.347
            - Mm-hmm.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.383
               ♪♪

08:43.890 --> 08:46.758
  - OK, all I have heard about

08:46.793 --> 08:48.793
              is this Elliot guy
           and his book signing.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.363
         I want to hear about my
        brilliant best friend's.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.499
    Tell me, how did it go?
    - It didn't really "go."

08:54.535 --> 08:57.135
 - Couldn't have been that bad.
  - Let's just say I've signed

08:57.170 --> 09:00.005
           more coffee cups here
    in an hour than books there.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.007
   - OK, I think you're being
   modest. Is she, Jeannine?

09:03.644 --> 09:06.144
   - He even won her over. She's
     the toughest critic I know.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.046
                 Do you remember
     my first grade book report?

09:08.081 --> 09:09.848
        - Oh, I remember.
          - She made me

09:09.883 --> 09:11.683
              do four revisions,
     and it was a 30-page book--

09:11.718 --> 09:14.786
 - 30-page book on butterflies!
     - And to cheer you up,

09:14.821 --> 09:17.022
    I made you a vanilla bean
        ice cream float--

09:17.057 --> 09:19.558
  - With the cookie crumbles?
  - I think that was the start

09:19.593 --> 09:22.227
          of my career.
     - Writing is rewriting.

09:22.262 --> 09:26.898
 My Princeton students pay a lot
        for that advice.

09:26.934 --> 09:30.702
  What? You think I can't read
 and hear you at the same time?

09:30.737 --> 09:33.405
  And to answer your question,
       Cassie had a small

09:33.440 --> 09:35.807
      but supportive crowd.
    - And by that, she means

09:35.842 --> 09:38.376
  her and my publicist, Piper.
          - You haven't

09:38.412 --> 09:42.080
 done any publicity, you refuse
    to throw my name around.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.982
          - Because I don't want
             everyone to know me

09:44.017 --> 09:46.484
  as "PEN/Faulkner Award-winning
    Jeannine Jordan's daughter."

09:46.520 --> 09:48.386
                  I want to make
         my own name for myself.

09:48.422 --> 09:51.189
      - And I respect that,
 but if no one knows that you've

09:51.224 --> 09:54.092
   written a book, you're not
   gonna be known as anything.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.661
    Now, take Elliot here...

09:56.697 --> 09:58.530
             - "Elliot." They're
          on a first-name basis.

09:58.565 --> 10:01.499
- His performance made me
interested in reading a story

10:01.535 --> 10:04.903
about a talking dragon.
And I'm enjoying it.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.705
            - So why should that
                   matter to me?

10:06.740 --> 10:08.840
- Because I would never have
picked up a fantasy book

10:08.875 --> 10:10.842
  and now I can't put it down.
      (cell phone ringing)

10:10.877 --> 10:13.411
Sweetheart, you could have
the same effect on people.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.580
               - Uh, it's Piper,
            I need to take this.

10:15.616 --> 10:18.516
                 Just excuse me.
                     Piper, hey.

10:18.552 --> 10:21.119
               - Is there really
               a talking dragon?

10:21.154 --> 10:23.622
- Well, technically,
it's telepathic.

10:23.657 --> 10:26.024
            - Gotcha.
    - OK, I'll see you then.

10:26.059 --> 10:29.027
              Um...

10:29.062 --> 10:33.064
  So my book editor to meet me;
  what do you think that means?

10:33.100 --> 10:35.300
- Well, if it's lunch,
that's a good thing.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.435
                  - What if it's
                at their office?

10:41.008 --> 10:43.408
    - Who wants more lattes?
    - With cookie crumbles?

10:43.443 --> 10:45.610
       - Yeah. Coming up.
              - OK.

I have a 10 o'clock
appointment with Gwendolyn.

     they're expecting you.

            - "They"?

11:17.978 --> 11:20.512
       - Cassie! Thank you
         for coming in.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.947
  You know Piper and Julian...
  - We didn't officially meet,

11:22.983 --> 11:25.350
   but nice to see you again.
        - Oh, here he is,

11:25.385 --> 11:27.485
             Elliot.
         - Hello again.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.521
              - Hi.
  - Did you finish my book yet?

11:29.556 --> 11:31.289
- I have encyclopaedias
that are smaller.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.625
      Did you finish mine?
    - I did, actually, yeah.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.593
        - You're kidding?
       - No. It's alright,

11:35.629 --> 11:38.296
   you could make it up to me by
  reading mine on the book tour.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.298
               - What book tour?

11:40.333 --> 11:42.667
   - Piper and Julian told me
        how well you two

11:42.703 --> 11:45.036
   hit it off at the reading.
   - You had great chemistry.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.706
       - We barely spoke.
       - I felt it, too.

11:47.741 --> 11:50.008
- We recently had success
pairing new writers

11:50.043 --> 11:51.943
with our established authors.

11:51.978 --> 11:53.945
And as you may
have noticed,

11:53.980 --> 11:56.214
Elliot tends to draw a crowd
wherever he goes.

11:56.249 --> 12:00.151
          - Sure, but my book is
        a romantic comedy memoir

12:00.187 --> 12:02.187
   about getting over a breakup,
            and Elliot writes...

12:02.222 --> 12:05.690
         nerd novels. I'm sorry.

12:05.726 --> 12:08.493
- Uh, successful nerd novels.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.061
            - Still, I don't see
                 the connection.

12:10.097 --> 12:13.198
- Here's the thing, Cassie.
You need the exposure,

12:13.233 --> 12:15.133
especially with females
18 to 35.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.202
That's a large, loyal market

12:17.237 --> 12:19.971
that still buys books, then
blogs and tweets about them.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.873
And they happen to love

12:21.908 --> 12:24.042
        Elliot's novels.
          - Oh, I saw.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.311
          Practically passed out
     when he put on his glasses.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.680
 You know, I'm sorry, but do you
         even need those glasses

12:28.715 --> 12:30.548
   or are they the fake kind?
       - I'll never tell.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.383
      - So much chemistry.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.519
        - It's palpable.
      - This is why we want

12:34.554 --> 12:37.355
    you two on tour together.
             - Wow,

12:37.390 --> 12:39.324
           me on a book tour.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.526
 OK, well, how long is the tour?

12:41.561 --> 12:45.196
- It's a week trial run. Just a
few Northeastern college towns.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.899
         - And what does
        a trial run mean?

12:47.934 --> 12:51.169
       - Here's the thing:
    your book just came out,

12:51.204 --> 12:53.938
and our early projections
show sluggish sales,

12:53.974 --> 12:56.174
which is making it hard
to get reviewers to read it.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.576
           - But these things
           take time, right?

12:58.612 --> 13:00.512
- Slow roll-outs are
a thing of the past.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.581
Name recognition sells.
So the hope is that by teaming

13:03.617 --> 13:06.584
    you with our star author,
    we'll see sales increase.

13:06.620 --> 13:10.021
          - And if not?
     - Then, unfortunately,

13:10.056 --> 13:12.957
we'll have to re-evaluate
our partnership.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.627
      - No pressure, right?
          - I'm sorry.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.229
         It's tough for
     new writers out there.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.932
But we love your book and we see
    a lot of promise in you.

13:20.967 --> 13:24.269
          - What did you want me
          to do on tour? I mean,

13:24.304 --> 13:26.538
              aside from winning
              Elliot's fan base.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.640
                    - Similar to
         the signings yesterday,

13:28.675 --> 13:32.076
       but with readings.
           - Readings?

13:32.112 --> 13:34.579
         I just... I really hate
                public speaking,

13:34.614 --> 13:38.449
so what if I just sign the books
  and let Elliot do the talking?

13:38.485 --> 13:41.419
      - Well, there's also
   interviews and Q and A's...

13:41.454 --> 13:43.588
                - Maybe we could
          come up with something

13:43.623 --> 13:45.490
        that doesn't end with me
           breaking out in hives

13:45.525 --> 13:47.458
           or freezing on stage.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.461
        It's just not very good
              for sales.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.764
- Well, I was told that
your mother was at the reading.

13:52.799 --> 13:55.900
She's a big draw.
Maybe you'd be more comfortable

13:55.936 --> 13:58.670
   doing interviews with her?
   The press would eat it up.

             - Yeah.

I'm so sorry. I didn't mean
to run out like that.

I'm very appreciative
of everything

    today at MacDonner Press.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.018

I could tell. I'm sorry,

15:55.989 --> 15:57.789
I thought they would have given
you a heads-up about the tour.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.891

15:59.926 --> 16:01.793
 but you didn't have to come all
the way down here to deliver it.

16:01.828 --> 16:06.397

- Opening act, it's...
You're funny.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.707

                   on the clock,

16:15.742 --> 16:17.475
    so if you could just make it
 fast, whatever you have to say.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.944
         - As a barista?
         - Not all of us

16:19.980 --> 16:23.081
     were bestsellers by age 27,
     so some of us have to work.

16:23.116 --> 16:26.050
      - Aw, you googled me.
    - And you're stalking me.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.720
            How did you find me,
                     by the way?

to storytelling.

That's why I requested
you to be on the tour.

     an incredible opportunity--

16:43.269 --> 16:46.471
             - But?
 - Nobody wants to hear from me.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.940
     The moment anyone finds out
                  who my mom is,

16:48.975 --> 16:50.975
    I cease to exist as a person
         and much less a writer.

                       admit it,

16:53.113 --> 16:54.979
           that's why you wanted
         to tour with me, right?

might have crossed my mind,

17:01.154 --> 17:03.488

your book and realized

17:03.523 --> 17:04.989

Jordan's daughter.

          original barista, too.

to fly, we can make arrangements
            or get you a driver.

24:29.402 --> 24:32.102
 - How are my favourite authors?
  - I think I'm gonna be sick!

24:32.138 --> 24:34.238
     - You should do it now
     before you get on TV.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.474
      - You're not helping.
   - Just take a deep breath.

24:36.509 --> 24:39.810
          (deep breath)
           That's it.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.413
        And another one.
 - Now, when you get out there,

24:42.448 --> 24:44.882
          don't look in cameras.
          Just look at Samantha.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.951
           - Samantha?
           - The host.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.153
  She's gonna ask you about your
    book. Like what inspired it?

24:49.188 --> 24:51.322
What's your routine? Easy stuff.

24:51.357 --> 24:53.390
     Pretend like you're talking
         to one of your friends.

24:53.426 --> 24:57.061
  - One of my friends. Got it.
              - OK.

24:57.096 --> 24:59.096
           (knocking)
     - You're ready for us?

24:59.131 --> 25:02.800
              - OK.
       - Be good, Bungee.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.668
  - How does he make everything
          look so easy?

25:04.704 --> 25:06.804
        - That's Elliot.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.406
    I'll be just off camera.
     Don't forget to smile.

25:09.442 --> 25:11.842
       But not too smiley.

25:11.878 --> 25:14.144
- Smile but not too smiley.
That makes perfect sense.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.082
Are you live tweeting
the interview?

25:18.117 --> 25:21.252
     - What? No, I'm just making
   some arrangements for Bungee.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.856
             You're gonna be OK.
       You just have to breathe.

25:25.892 --> 25:28.526
- Why does everyone keep
reminding me to breathe?

25:28.561 --> 25:30.628
Has anyone ever forgotten
to breathe? Is that a thing?

25:30.663 --> 25:32.830
           - It's OK.
    - I'm gonna be right here

25:32.865 --> 25:35.533
if you need me, OK?
I got your back.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.835
- Elliot Somersby.
It's been a while.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.503
     - Samatha Wallace, hi.
          How are you?

25:39.539 --> 25:42.873
- And you must be Cassandra
Winslett. The interns cannot

25:42.909 --> 25:46.477
  stop talking about your book.
- Oh. Well, good things, I hope.

25:46.512 --> 25:48.212
- We all have
a breakup story, am I right?

25:48.247 --> 25:50.514
Elliot knows the drill.
We're gonna start with a segment

25:50.550 --> 25:52.850
on his book, and then we'll move
on to you, Cassandra.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.718
           Sound good?
            - Mm-hmm.

25:54.754 --> 25:58.355
   Oh, you can call me Cassie.
         - Cassie it is.

25:58.391 --> 26:03.160
      (TV show theme music)
 - I'm just trying to be myself.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.129
- OK. Here we go.

26:06.566 --> 26:09.967
Welcome back. With me now
is Elliot Somersby,

26:10.002 --> 26:12.202
   author of the best-selling
      <i> Dread Monarch Saga,</i>

26:12.238 --> 26:15.739
and an exciting new writer,
Cassie Winslett.

26:15.775 --> 26:18.375
Let's start with you, Elliot.
First of all, congratulations!

26:18.411 --> 26:20.911
Your second book is doing
even better than the first.

26:20.947 --> 26:23.581
       How does that feel?
     - Can't lie, Samantha,

26:23.616 --> 26:25.716
     it feels pretty great.
     - And I know your fans

26:25.751 --> 26:27.718
are eagerly awaiting
the third book

26:27.753 --> 26:30.921
in the trilogy. Any idea
when we'll be able to see that?

26:30.957 --> 26:33.023
- Um, let's just say I'm working

26:33.059 --> 26:35.059
very hard at giving it
the ending that it deserves.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.928
As for when you're gonna see it,

26:37.964 --> 26:40.364
well, I can't give away
all my secrets now, can I?

26:40.399 --> 26:43.567
 (Samantha and Elliot chuckling)
     - And, Cassie, I assume

26:43.603 --> 26:45.502
that there are no dragons
in your book.

26:45.538 --> 26:48.439
             - No dragons.

26:48.474 --> 26:50.941
     Although it is an adventure
           book, if you consider

26:50.977 --> 26:53.611
    everything that I did to get
   over my breakup an adventure.

26:53.646 --> 26:56.347
- I thought that the chapter
where you go stand-up paddle

26:56.382 --> 26:58.949
boarding is hilarious.
Would you say

26:58.985 --> 27:02.419
that <i> My Heartbreak Year</i>
is your <i> Eat, Pray, Love?</i>

27:02.455 --> 27:04.622
                   - Well, I did
                a lot of eating.

27:04.657 --> 27:08.192
        (women chuckling)
    Um, though the "journey"

27:08.227 --> 27:10.260
        was local and definitely
                    on a budget.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.962
      - So it's accessible?
        - (softly): Yeah.

27:11.998 --> 27:14.698
          - Pardon me?
             - Yes.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.367
           (mouthing)

27:16.402 --> 27:20.237
        And, um... We've all had
               our heart broken.

27:20.272 --> 27:23.641
                I know I've done
     my fair share of wallowing,

27:23.676 --> 27:26.443
         but I realized it's not
                about holding on

27:26.479 --> 27:29.446
    to the past, but your future
   and learning to love yourself

27:29.482 --> 27:32.416
            as you move forward.
    Sorry, I'm kind of rambling.

27:32.451 --> 27:35.285
      I'm a little nervous.
    - It's fine. The question

27:35.321 --> 27:37.788
that we all want to know is:
what does your mother

27:37.823 --> 27:41.792
    think about all of this?
          - My mother?

27:41.827 --> 27:43.927
- For those in the audience
that don't know,

27:43.963 --> 27:46.096
Cassie's mother is
author Jeannine Jordan.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.065
And this is your first book,
she must have had

27:48.100 --> 27:51.869
     tons of advice, right?
         - Um... Well...

27:54.273 --> 27:56.674
        ...we're very supportive
                 of one another.

27:56.709 --> 27:59.109
    - Great!

27:59.145 --> 28:01.178
Well, it looks like we're

28:01.213 --> 28:03.580
 out of time. I'd love to thank
    my guests Elliot Somersby

28:03.616 --> 28:06.016
and Cassandra Winslett
for being here today.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.818
Stay tuned. When we come back,

28:07.853 --> 28:11.355
we are gonna learn how to grow
tomatoes in the snow.

28:11.390 --> 28:14.591
      (TV show theme music)

28:14.627 --> 28:17.995
Alright! Great job, guys!

28:18.030 --> 28:20.931
I hope you have
a great rest of your book tour.

28:20.966 --> 28:24.334
          - Thank you.
          - Thank you.

28:24.370 --> 28:27.337
     - I completely bombed that,
              Elliot. I'm sorry.

28:27.373 --> 28:30.174
 You know, if you wanna back out
             of touring with me,

28:30.209 --> 28:32.943
    I completely understand.
 - Hey, hey. It wasn't that bad.

28:32.978 --> 28:35.713
Are you OK?

28:35.748 --> 28:37.848
                     - Yeah.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.917
           I just... It's a lot.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.988
- Yah. Um...

28:45.024 --> 28:47.024
       I'm gonna head back
        to the Green Room

28:47.059 --> 28:49.393
to make sure Bungee hasn't eaten
    any pillows or anything.

28:49.428 --> 28:52.463
 - I heard there's a gift basket
            with our name on it,

28:52.498 --> 28:55.232
so, you know, I could stress eat
     some candy right about now.

28:55.267 --> 28:58.202
              - OK.

29:05.344 --> 29:08.011
at did we get?

29:08.047 --> 29:10.147
- Oh, uh, a couple of mugs

29:10.182 --> 29:12.649
          and candy...

29:12.685 --> 29:15.185
  and copies of our own books.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.254
                    - Ha!

29:17.289 --> 29:19.356
        Well, at least, we could
              sign each other's,

29:19.391 --> 29:22.159
                sell 'em online.

29:22.194 --> 29:25.229
   - You know, I know we have

29:25.264 --> 29:27.231
     to do these interviews,
 but I don't have to like them.

29:27.266 --> 29:30.768
            - Why? You got this.

29:30.803 --> 29:33.170
- Just... You know, growing up,

29:33.205 --> 29:36.340
     I was always sheltered
   from my mom's writer life.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.375
     And then when I was 10,
           my dad died

29:38.410 --> 29:40.744
         and the shield
      wasn't there anymore.

29:40.780 --> 29:43.947
          - Oh. Sorry,
     that must've been hard.

29:43.983 --> 29:46.450
  - It was. Especially on her.

29:46.485 --> 29:49.186
 I mean, suddenly, she's single

29:49.221 --> 29:52.956
 and juggling everything and...

29:52.992 --> 29:55.125
You know, she is so impressive,

29:55.161 --> 29:57.294
       and I would happily
  talk about her all day long,

29:57.329 --> 30:00.564
 it's just it's everybody else.
   They want to pick us apart.

30:00.599 --> 30:03.767
      - Is that maybe where
   the stage fright came from?

30:03.803 --> 30:06.103
               ♪♪
          - I guess so.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.572
   - The fear of not living up
      to what came before?

30:08.607 --> 30:10.474
            I get it.

30:10.509 --> 30:13.243
           (chuckling)

30:13.279 --> 30:15.412
     - You know, growing up,

30:15.447 --> 30:17.948
 it didn't matter what I wrote,
   my teachers always compared

30:17.983 --> 30:20.150
      my work to my mom's.
      I mean, I was a kid!

30:20.186 --> 30:22.452
            - Yet you still
            became a writer.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.588
       (Cassie chuckling)
   - It's hereditary, I guess.

30:24.623 --> 30:28.125
It's just I really want my book

30:28.160 --> 30:30.661
  to be my own voice, you know?
           I don't...

30:30.696 --> 30:34.665
     I don't want to be seen
 as the "kid of someone famous."

30:34.700 --> 30:37.668
    It's very important to me
     that I make my own way.

30:37.703 --> 30:40.804
  I mean, otherwise, what's the
  point if nobody's interested?

30:40.840 --> 30:43.106
   - You make them interested.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.075
       You're the writer,
       you tell the story.

30:45.110 --> 30:47.811
       - Oh, is that some
     of your wizard wisdom?

30:47.847 --> 30:50.948
         - First of all, there's
          no wizards in my book.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.850
                You haven't read
          my book yet, have you?

30:52.885 --> 30:55.919
  - What snacks did you bring?
             - Wow,

30:55.955 --> 30:58.589
  nice pivot, great pivot. I'm
gonna let this one go this time.

30:58.624 --> 31:01.491
 - Come on, it's all beef jerky
        and potato chips!

31:01.527 --> 31:03.694
     - There's some turkey jerky
                   in there too.

31:03.729 --> 31:05.863
- Yeah, OK, wow.
You have not been

31:05.898 --> 31:07.798
on a road trip
with a woman in a while,

31:07.833 --> 31:10.167
            have you?
     - Bungee would eat it.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.603
    - Bungee would eat
    this grocery bag!

31:12.638 --> 31:14.504
           OK, we need
      to make a food stop.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.307
        (Elliot sighing)
  - OK, alright. You know what?

31:17.343 --> 31:19.309
       I know the perfect place.

31:19.345 --> 31:23.347
           (laughing)

31:27.086 --> 31:29.152
- Normally, we don't allow pets,

31:29.188 --> 31:31.889
but it's slow
and your dog is adorable.

31:31.924 --> 31:35.325
       - Thank you. It's so cold
outside, I really appreciate it.

31:35.361 --> 31:37.961
- And I'm also a fan.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.830
      (waitress chuckling)

31:39.865 --> 31:42.466
- Wow, where did you
find this place?

31:42.501 --> 31:44.401
On a list of places
where all your fans work?

31:44.436 --> 31:46.536
  - Actually, believe it or not,

31:46.572 --> 31:50.073
    I ate here three times a day
          for two days straight.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.808
- What? How did you do that?

31:51.844 --> 31:53.577
       - I was on my first tour.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.679
                  I was younger.
     I was trying to save money.

31:55.714 --> 31:57.848
            - Mm-hmm.
 - But you gotta admit, though,

31:57.883 --> 32:00.684
    the food is pretty good.
- You're right, delicious, but--

32:00.719 --> 32:02.486
  - It's better than beef jerky.

32:02.521 --> 32:06.490
   But not dog treats. Right,
   Bungee? Hm, you want one?

32:06.525 --> 32:09.860
     Yeah, good girl. Yeah.
  - You two are cute together.

32:09.895 --> 32:12.562
    - Yeah, well, we've been
         through a lot.

32:12.598 --> 32:15.098
       She was a congratulations
              for my first book.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.100
- Oh. From your publisher?

32:17.136 --> 32:20.771
  (music playing in background)
        - No. From, uh...

32:20.806 --> 32:24.041
       from my ex-wife, Allison.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.509
     You know, sometimes I think

32:25.544 --> 32:27.711
        Bungee likes her
     more than she likes me.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.780
- Oh, why is she with you?

32:29.815 --> 32:32.115
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to pry.

32:32.151 --> 32:34.384
     - No. Road trips are fueled
        on gasoline and stories.

32:34.420 --> 32:37.020
- Well, I did spill
my guts to you earlier.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.959
         - Allison just recently
               moved to Buffalo.

32:41.994 --> 32:45.228
     She hasn't seen the dog
        for a few months.

32:45.264 --> 32:47.097
           Actually, since we've
                  been divorced.

32:47.132 --> 32:50.567

01:00:50.848 --> 01:00:54.082
         for lost time.
 - Also congratulations, Elliot.

01:00:54.118 --> 01:00:56.385
           - For what?
      - You've been awarded

01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:00.756
        the American Publishers'
       Author of the Year Award.

01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:02.924
    The reception is in New York
                   in two weeks.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.327
     - Elliot, that's huge!
              - OK,

01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:07.195
       go freshen up. We'll meet
        back here in 45 minutes.

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:09.364
    - They'll get your bags.
              - OK.

01:01:14.204 --> 01:01:17.272
      - Alright, you guys,
      I ask all my guests

01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:19.241
     to join me in the Book Chat
                    Speed Round.

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:21.243
              Now, the rules are
              very, very simple.

01:01:21.278 --> 01:01:23.245
        Answer as many questions
                      as you can

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.313
            in under one minute.
                  Are you ready?

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:28.183
             - Sure.
 - OK, we're setting the timer.

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:30.752
             And... where do you
                  like to write?

01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:32.821
- My best friend's coffee shop,
Brewed by Becca

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:34.523
    in Princeton, New Jersey!
            - Elliot?

01:01:34.558 --> 01:01:36.958
      - Usually my laptop.

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:39.761
         - Oh, come on!
   - That's not a real answer.

01:01:39.797 --> 01:01:42.364
       - OK, favourite book that
      you've read most recently?

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:44.700
       -<i> My Hearbreak Year</i>

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:47.502
       by Cassie Winslett.
 - Is that another joke answer?

01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:49.337
       - No. I've read it
         multiple times.

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:52.507
           - You have?
     - OK. Off that answer,

01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:54.142
      what do you like most
   about each other's writing?

01:01:54.178 --> 01:01:56.445
- Uh, his imagination.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.314
       - She makes me want
     to be a better writer.

01:01:59.349 --> 01:02:01.883
           (tick tock)
            (buzzing)

01:02:01.919 --> 01:02:04.786
   - And that's our speed round.
           I honestly don't know

01:02:04.822 --> 01:02:07.022
           if we could've topped
        that last answer anyway.

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:09.458
                I'd like to give
                a huge thank you

01:02:09.493 --> 01:02:11.727
              to Cassie Winslett
            and Elliot Somersby.

01:02:11.762 --> 01:02:13.695
                  Thank you guys
          so much for coming on.

01:02:13.731 --> 01:02:17.299
     - Thanks for having us.
        - And we're off.

01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:20.836
     (cell phone vibrating)
   - Thanks. That was a blast.

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:22.871
         I'm sorry, I just gotta
               return this call.

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:24.406
    - Yeah.

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:26.675
       (inaudible talking)

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:29.911
  - That was really incredible
         what you said,

01:02:29.947 --> 01:02:31.980
but you have
your own book to promote,

01:02:32.015 --> 01:02:33.982
you don't have to pretend
to be into mine.

01:02:34.017 --> 01:02:36.017
             - I didn't. I meant
               every word of it.

01:02:36.053 --> 01:02:38.687
            - Really?
             - Yeah.

01:02:38.722 --> 01:02:40.555
                   But I do have

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:44.359
        to go. I'm late. I gotta
     drop Bungee off to Allison.

01:02:44.394 --> 01:02:46.161
But I'll see you at the Q and A?
            - Mm-hmm.

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:49.264
                - Great!

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:51.533
  - I can't wait to send these
   pictures to your roommate.

01:02:51.568 --> 01:02:54.603
  - You and Becca are friends?!
- Oh yeah, we text all the time.

01:02:54.638 --> 01:02:56.838
                 She reached out
     about your website, and now

01:02:56.874 --> 01:02:58.940
we're constantly trading photos.
     The three of us should have

01:02:58.976 --> 01:03:00.942
a girl's night when we get back.
          - Yeah, sure.

01:03:00.978 --> 01:03:02.944
          - Where did Elliot go?

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:06.681
- Oh! He went to go see his ex.
She wants to see the dog.

01:03:06.717 --> 01:03:08.416
                   - Huh.

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:10.752
- What does "huh" mean?

01:03:10.788 --> 01:03:12.888
     - I'm just really impressed
            that they get along.

01:03:12.923 --> 01:03:16.458
 I mean, he was crushed when she
left. I think he blames himself.

01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:19.528
- Oh. How did it end?

01:03:19.563 --> 01:03:22.430
            - He spent more time
             working on his book

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:24.466
      than his relationship, and
   one succeeded and one failed.

01:03:24.501 --> 01:03:26.735
               I guess it's just
                    how it goes.

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:28.837
       Let's get a coffee.

01:03:30.607 --> 01:03:33.208
               ♪♪

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:36.912
     - Alright, we have time
    for a few more questions.

01:03:36.947 --> 01:03:39.881
     You in the second row.
 - This question is for Cassie.

01:03:39.917 --> 01:03:42.217
       Which adventure was
  your favourite and which was

01:03:42.252 --> 01:03:44.386
       the hardest to do?
      - Which adventure was

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:46.788
                   my favourite?

01:03:48.692 --> 01:03:51.293
                I'm gonna answer
     your second question first.

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:54.763
       The hardest was going out
            to dinner by myself.

01:03:54.798 --> 01:03:56.731
               I don't mean just
                sitting at a bar

01:03:56.767 --> 01:03:58.900
    scrolling through your phone
     trying to look busy, alone.

01:03:58.936 --> 01:04:01.937
          You all know
     what I'm talking about.

01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:04.773
             I challenged myself
            to go out to dinner,

01:04:04.808 --> 01:04:07.342
               to sit at a table
     with no book, and no phone,

01:04:07.377 --> 01:04:09.444
     and just enjoy being there.

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:11.913
               Which was
        surprisingly difficult.

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:14.950
              But it also became
         my favourite adventure.

01:04:14.985 --> 01:04:18.453
    I appreciated the food more,
  I made friends with strangers,

01:04:18.488 --> 01:04:21.323
          and, most importantly,

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:24.926
       I felt good about myself.
  I challenge you all to try it.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:30.532
- Well, I have
one more question.

01:04:30.567 --> 01:04:32.500
Elliot,

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:34.502
      it's my understanding
 that after the signing tonight,

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:36.338
         this is the end
       of the book tour--

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:39.374
 - Yeah. Yeah. It went by fast.

01:04:39.409 --> 01:04:42.143
                 - Yeah, it did.

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:44.980
 - What do you plan to do after?
            - Write.

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:49.017
      I mean, you're all waiting
      for the third book, right?

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:51.753
        (crowd cheering)

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:55.590
 - Anything you want to tell us
     about your final book?

01:04:57.527 --> 01:05:00.896
  - As someone who just finished
        reading his second book,

01:05:00.931 --> 01:05:03.331
           I'm not even thinking
                  about a third.

01:05:03.367 --> 01:05:05.567
    I'm gonna read the first and
         second book over again.

01:05:05.602 --> 01:05:07.869
         Who's with me?
        (crowd cheering)

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:14.142
        - Cassie Winslett
      and Elliot Somersby!

           (cheering)

01:05:16.046 --> 01:05:18.346
- Thank you for the save.

01:05:18.382 --> 01:05:20.181
               - I owed you one.

01:05:22.753 --> 01:05:26.021
     - That was a long day.
      Well done, everyone.

01:05:26.056 --> 01:05:28.723
    - Who wants to celebrate?
      - Actually, I was...

01:05:28.759 --> 01:05:30.759
         I was gonna show Cassie
                around the city.

01:05:30.794 --> 01:05:33.862
- That's OK, we can go together.

01:05:33.897 --> 01:05:36.531
 - Julian, we should go. We have
      a lot of work to do still.

01:05:36.566 --> 01:05:38.833
            - We do?
            - Yeah.

01:05:38.869 --> 01:05:41.336
   Sure. We have tons of work.
       Have fun, you two.

01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:44.239

   Let me know where you are.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.408
            - Julian!
      - OK. You can pin it

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.343
     on the phone. There's
     a setting for pinning.

01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:53.315
       - (Piper): Julian!
          (soft music)

01:05:57.321 --> 01:06:00.622
- You know, I never thought
I'd say this,

01:06:00.657 --> 01:06:03.525
but I don't want
this book tour to end.

01:06:05.162 --> 01:06:06.928
            - Neither do I.

01:06:08.966 --> 01:06:10.865
       - (together): So...
         (both laughing)

01:06:10.901 --> 01:06:13.935

       - Yeah, so have I.

       - No. You, please.

 around here for a little while.

That's very... responsible.

                       a doctor?

01:10:00.197 --> 01:10:02.197

had this dream

01:10:02.232 --> 01:10:03.998
that I was gonna join
his medical practice.

and so respected,

01:10:08.939 --> 01:10:11.406
and I thought
I could never live up

01:10:11.441 --> 01:10:14.842
to any of his accomplishments.
So, I told him

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:16.844
that I was studying medicine,

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.746

Not that I was deceiving him,
but because I didn't try.

I thought I could never be
as good as he was,

01:10:29.025 --> 01:10:30.658

medicine altogether.

I bought my very first book here
    with my allowance money.

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:28.829
      And I also kicked off

01:19:28.865 --> 01:19:31.232
 my first book tour here, though
  I didn't know it at the time.

          Thanks to all
        of your support,

01:19:40.409 --> 01:19:42.543
      I am actually writing
            a novel,

01:19:42.578 --> 01:19:44.512
          and I believe
        that a sneak peek

01:19:44.547 --> 01:19:47.248
of my very first chapter
is on my website.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:49.750
   Just saying that this novel
            has been

01:19:49.786 --> 01:19:51.852
        a labour of love
      is an understatement.

01:19:53.556 --> 01:19:55.923
        Oh, and it looks
    like we have a question.

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:59.393
           - Take it.
  - OK. A question in the back?

01:19:59.428 --> 01:20:01.562
              - Yeah, uh, I know

01:20:01.597 --> 01:20:03.430
      that this book is fiction,
                   but the pages

01:20:03.466 --> 01:20:05.733
                on your website,
         they seem kind of real.

01:20:05.768 --> 01:20:08.969
                 I was wondering
         what the influence was.

01:20:09.005 --> 01:20:11.739
        - Uh, well, sir,

01:20:11.774 --> 01:20:13.941
      the book is inspired

01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:16.544
by a... a road trip I took

01:20:16.579 --> 01:20:19.280
   on my very first book tour.
           - And, uh,

01:20:19.315 --> 01:20:21.782
            who is the influence
   for your dashing leading man?

01:20:21.818 --> 01:20:24.552
  - I don't believe that I used
       the term "dashing"

01:20:24.587 --> 01:20:27.054
        to describe him.
- I mean, that was just implied.

01:20:27.089 --> 01:20:29.056
- Well, he was based

01:20:29.091 --> 01:20:31.091
          on the writer
  I went on tour with, loosely.

01:20:31.127 --> 01:20:33.060
        Elliot Somersby,
   maybe you've heard of him?

01:20:33.095 --> 01:20:36.630
 - I have actually. He's a very,
           very talented writer.

01:20:36.666 --> 01:20:38.232
        (crowd laughing)

01:20:38.267 --> 01:20:41.101
 So have you... have you thought
               of an ending yet?

01:20:41.137 --> 01:20:44.071
  - I'm still working on that.
   - Well, maybe your dashing

01:20:44.106 --> 01:20:46.440
 leading man could help you out.
  - You know, I actually think

01:20:46.475 --> 01:20:48.676
  that he has been too busy in
 his own personal life to help.

01:20:48.711 --> 01:20:50.477
        So if anyone else
        has questions...

01:20:50.513 --> 01:20:52.913
   - Yeah, I have another one.
   - Wait, what are you doing?

01:20:52.949 --> 01:20:55.349
     - It's fun. I've never been
            on this side before.

01:20:55.384 --> 01:20:58.285
- I mean, no, what are you
doing here? What about Allison?

01:20:58.321 --> 01:21:00.955
                      - Allison?

01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:04.458
       We're not together.
       - But your speech.

01:21:04.493 --> 01:21:06.026
         - Is that why you left?

01:21:06.062 --> 01:21:09.029
- Why don't we take five,

01:21:09.065 --> 01:21:10.598
and those of you who'd like
to line up for the book signing,

01:21:10.633 --> 01:21:14.668

01:21:16.005 --> 01:21:18.672
                - Allison and I,
we're just trying to be friends.

01:21:18.708 --> 01:21:20.541
                      That's it.

01:21:24.714 --> 01:21:27.047
                - I invited you.

01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:29.283
              I-I just wanted it
               to be a surprise.

01:21:29.318 --> 01:21:31.518
    - It just seemed
    like you had a lot

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:34.288
that you needed to work through.
      - Yeah, well, I did.

01:21:34.323 --> 01:21:36.891
                    And I needed
                 to do it alone.

01:21:36.926 --> 01:21:38.859
                     I needed to
                get over myself.

01:21:38.895 --> 01:21:41.862
              I needed to write.

01:21:41.898 --> 01:21:43.898

                   move forward.

01:21:45.735 --> 01:21:49.136
           I was able to do that
                 because of you.

01:21:49.171 --> 01:21:51.372
