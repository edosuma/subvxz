00:08.342 --> 00:12.631
In the championship match of the
Tenkaichi Budokai junior division,

00:12.846 --> 00:18.512
the two promising youths,
Goten and Trunks, had their showdown.

00:18.727 --> 00:23.847
The glory of victory shone over Trunks' head.

01:53.071 --> 01:57.986
"Restless Foreboding...
A Mysterious Warrior Appears!!"

02:03.582 --> 02:05.072
Papa”.

02:21.517 --> 02:25.101
Waugh! Y-You got me!

02:25.312 --> 02:29.271
You sure are strong! You beat me!

02:30.943 --> 02:34.902
Ringout! Amazingly, Trunks-kun is the winner!

02:35.113 --> 02:36.728
Oh, he did it on purpose, huh?

02:36.949 --> 02:38.564
That's our Satan for you!

02:38.784 --> 02:41.366
Way to go, world champion!

02:47.084 --> 02:50.121
That was nice work.
You are a very gracious loser.

02:50.337 --> 02:54.296
W-Well, I think I'll grab a
quick nap in my dressing room.

02:55.300 --> 03:00.920
|-| can't figure him out.
Maybe he really is strong.

03:11.942 --> 03:14.775
That hurt! I'm gonna die!

03:14.987 --> 03:19.981
C-Curse that dirty brat! I told him
to do it gently! That moron!

03:20.200 --> 03:23.533
We will now have a 30-minute
break before the start

03:23.745 --> 03:26.657
of the adult division of the Tenkaichi Budokai.

03:26.874 --> 03:33.370
The adult division will start
at 1:40 p.m., so please sit tight.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.955
Oh, there's a break, is there?

03:37.301 --> 03:40.464
I'm hungry. Maybe I'll get
a little something to eat.

03:41.513 --> 03:44.596
Oh, I'm sorry, only those who
have passed the preliminaries

03:44.808 --> 03:46.423
are able to enter here.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.726
Oh, yeah? The results of the
preliminaries are out already?

03:49.938 --> 03:53.522
In that case, I think it's likely
that all of us have passed.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.942
Oh? Just a moment, please.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.394
Your names, please?

03:58.614 --> 03:59.854
Son Goku.

04:00.073 --> 04:00.937
Kuririn.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.568
No. 18.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.820
Vegeta.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.117
Ma Junior.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.536
Ma Junior?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.579
Because of what happened long ago.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.043
It wouldn't do to enter
under the name "Piccolo."

04:12.252 --> 04:13.708
Well, true enough.

04:13.921 --> 04:17.539
Ah, ou're Oh here, ou're Oh here!
y
Please excuse me.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.373
You have all passed the preliminary round.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.504
Please, go right on in.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.508
There will be a drawing at 1:30
to determine the lineups.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.887
1:30, huh? That gives us 20 minutes.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.224
You know, aside from our group and Gohan,

04:33.440 --> 04:35.021
there don't seem to be any decent fighters,

04:35.233 --> 04:37.770
so we're going to claim
all of that prize money.

04:37.986 --> 04:41.069
I ain't got any way to use it in the Next World.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.067
It sure is nice for you, Goku.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.569
I mean, you don't age in the Next World, huh?

04:45.786 --> 04:47.492
Yeah. Kuririn, you wanna die, too?

04:47.704 --> 04:52.869
Now cut that out! I'm awfully happy
where I am right now. Right?

04:53.085 --> 04:54.575
Dummy.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.465
Hey, Goten! Come here and have a look!

05:11.561 --> 05:13.472
What?

05:13.689 --> 05:17.227
Look at that guy!
The one over there in the mask!

05:17.442 --> 05:19.228
That's a funny-looking mask, huh?

05:19.444 --> 05:22.777
If he's in there, it means
he passed the preliminary.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.025
And that means...

05:24.241 --> 05:27.153
How about it? We can use him, don't you think?

05:28.203 --> 05:31.445
With that outfit, we can both
fit inside, and no one will know.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.780
Hm? What do you mean?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.584
Don't you get it? In other words,
we go and pop him one,

05:36.795 --> 05:38.660
and while he's knocked out,
we take his clothes.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.916
We pretend to be him, and enter the matches!

05:41.133 --> 05:45.342
We can't do something like that!
You're talking crazy, Trunks-kun!

05:46.346 --> 05:49.713
What's wrong with you? Don't you
want to fight in the adult matches?

05:49.933 --> 05:52.219
Well, sure I do, but...

05:52.436 --> 05:55.052
Yeah, right? Okay, that settles it!

05:56.481 --> 05:58.597
H-Hold on!

05:58.817 --> 05:59.932
Excuse me!

06:00.152 --> 06:02.268
What, you want an autograph, kid?

06:02.487 --> 06:06.355
There's a pretty lady over there
who says she wants to talk to you.

06:06.575 --> 06:07.485
What?

06:07.701 --> 06:11.410
But she's too shy,
so she wanted me to come get you.

06:11.621 --> 06:12.997
|-|s that right? Where?

06:13.206 --> 06:14.787
Over here, over here!

06:16.710 --> 06:19.497
W-Where is she, where is she?
Is she really pretty?

06:19.713 --> 06:22.045
I should warn you,
I have pretty particular tastes.

06:22.257 --> 06:25.841
Where are you, where are you, pretty lady--

06:32.142 --> 06:34.224
All right!

06:34.436 --> 06:36.347
Trunks-kun...!

06:36.563 --> 06:38.474
Give me a hand, Goten.

06:40.609 --> 06:42.941
We did it! We did it!

06:48.950 --> 06:51.157
Hey, let's get his clothes off of him.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.196
--W-We're going to get inside here?
--Yeah!

06:56.416 --> 06:59.408
But we're so small,
they'll know it's us, won't they?

06:59.628 --> 07:02.836
You're such a dummy.
Both of us wear it together! Both of us!

07:03.048 --> 07:05.835
Huh? Both of us?

07:20.357 --> 07:22.188
You think no one can tell like this?

07:22.400 --> 07:25.483
You dummy! There's no way anyone will know!

07:30.826 --> 07:34.068
All right, it's perfect! No one will ever know!

07:34.287 --> 07:36.152
I don't know about this...

07:38.917 --> 07:41.454
The drawing is about to start!

07:41.670 --> 07:44.036
Right! I'll be right there!

07:44.256 --> 07:45.462
--Won't we?
--Uh-huh!

07:45.674 --> 07:47.380
All right, now to hurry back!

07:47.592 --> 07:50.459
H-Hey! The other way! The other way!

07:51.930 --> 07:52.919
Ow-w-w-w. . .!

07:53.140 --> 07:55.347
I can't see where we're going, you know!

07:55.559 --> 07:57.470
You can always poke some holes.

08:00.063 --> 08:00.893
You're right!

08:01.106 --> 08:03.563
Heh-heh, now it's perfect!

08:13.493 --> 08:15.984
Oh, that's good, that's good!

08:20.750 --> 08:24.368
H-Hey, are you sure you should
eat so much before the matches?

08:24.588 --> 08:28.206
And do dead guys get hungry
in the first place?

08:28.425 --> 08:31.462
It don't matter either way whether
you eat or not in the Next World,

08:31.678 --> 08:34.465
but the food in the lower realms
tastes much better!

08:35.640 --> 08:38.131
Ah, here you are!

08:38.351 --> 08:41.138
Oh, Gohan! How did it go?

08:41.354 --> 08:43.561
Ah, Trunks-kun won.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.858
Mister Satan-san looked
like he lost on purpose.

08:48.069 --> 08:52.779
Hmm, yeah, "on purpose."
How does he come up with this stuff?

08:52.991 --> 08:53.980
What do you mean by that?

08:54.201 --> 08:56.817
D-Don't make too much of it.

08:58.955 --> 09:02.243
Kuririn-san! Please, be careful
about what you say!

09:02.459 --> 09:04.199
A-All right.

09:06.087 --> 09:10.080
Gohan! We ordered for you, too.
You're eating, right?

09:10.300 --> 09:13.758
Oh, yes. |'m--|'m eating, I'm eating.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.098
This food is delicious, isn't it?

09:24.314 --> 09:26.680
Ain't it? Some more over here!

09:26.900 --> 09:29.562
What is with these people?

09:29.778 --> 09:33.896
For crying out loud, what is
the deal with Saiyan stomachs?

09:34.115 --> 09:35.275
Saiyan?

09:35.492 --> 09:36.356
Kuririn-san!

09:36.576 --> 09:40.569
O-Okay! Okay! I won't say anything else!

09:42.791 --> 09:45.658
|'m stuffed, |'m stuffed! That was delicious!

09:47.796 --> 09:52.130
Whoo! The food in this world sure is good!

09:52.342 --> 09:55.175
You didn't eat anything, huh? Are you dieting?

09:55.387 --> 09:57.799
The drawing is about to start, isn't it?

10:24.624 --> 10:28.208
H-Hey, that man is hovering in mid-air.

10:33.091 --> 10:36.800
Good day. You are Son Goku-san, yes?

10:37.012 --> 10:39.503
H-How do you know me?

10:39.723 --> 10:42.590
l have heard some stories.

10:42.809 --> 10:46.518
I wanted to come and play against you myself.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.772
I, too, was able to pass the preliminary round.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.396
| only hope that our lineups will work out

10:53.611 --> 10:56.068
to allow me to compete against you.

10:57.282 --> 11:00.615
Of course, I am not confident
that I could beat you...

11:00.827 --> 11:04.411
...but I would like to know
exactly how strong you are.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.838
By all means, if I could just shake your hand...

11:15.050 --> 11:18.008
Huh? Ah, pleased to meet you.

11:27.562 --> 11:32.181
Indeed. You possess a fine spirit,
just as the rumors told.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.105
Well then, if you will pardon me...

11:47.290 --> 11:49.747
W-Who was that, Goku?

11:51.086 --> 11:52.576
I don't know.

11:55.340 --> 12:01.757
But I'm bettin' we won't be the
only ones who get easy wins now.

12:03.431 --> 12:07.595
Oh, are you sure? He didn't seem that tough.

12:07.811 --> 12:11.429
He just looked like a weirdo to me.

12:42.011 --> 12:45.299
Those guys aren't from Earth, are they?

12:47.392 --> 12:49.348
You're right.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.553
l have no idea who they might be.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.388
Why would off-worlders
be someplace like this?

12:55.608 --> 13:00.102
Huh? H-Hey, what does he mean,
they're not from Earth?

13:00.321 --> 13:05.441
O-Oh, that man is... a little bit odd.

13:05.660 --> 13:06.991
Y-Yeah, you're right.

13:07.203 --> 13:10.036
Come to think of it, he looks a little pale, too.

13:10.248 --> 13:15.413
Okay, whatever, let's hurry up.
The tournament drawing is starting.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.583
Y-Yeah .

13:16.796 --> 13:21.005
Sixteen contestants will be competing, huh?
I wonder what they're like.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.754
Well, I doubt any of them are anything special.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.713
Ah, they're here, they're here!

13:28.933 --> 13:29.797
Yo!

13:30.018 --> 13:33.761
Let's see... Are all of our contestants here now?

13:33.980 --> 13:36.813
Okay then, let's call for Mister Satan.

13:37.025 --> 13:42.145
Mister Satan is resting,
and asked us to draw for him instead.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.196
O-Oh, he did? All right then, we will.

13:45.408 --> 13:48.024
Okay, everyone!
We're going to hold the drawing

13:48.244 --> 13:50.155
to determine our lineups now,
so when your name is called,

13:50.371 --> 13:52.828
please come and draw one of these numbers.

13:53.958 --> 13:54.993
Please, God,

13:55.210 --> 13:59.419
let me not run into these guys
in the first round, at least!

13:59.631 --> 14:02.543
Kuririn, when you say "God,"
you're talking about Dende.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.875
Oh, you're right. Doesn't matter, though.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.085
Please, God! Please, Dende!

14:18.775 --> 14:22.359
Other than those two,
nobody seems all that special.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.401
W-What's their story?
They sure look menacing, huh?

14:27.617 --> 14:29.949
They're overpowered, ain't they?

14:33.498 --> 14:37.912
H-He's a contestant, too?
He sure has a strange build.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.664
All right, I'll call you in
Japanese alphabetical order.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.121
Uh... Killa-san?

14:43.341 --> 14:44.831
Yeah.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.213
Number 14.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.509
Right, Contestant Killa is number 14.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.436
Contestant Killa, number 14.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.935
Contestant Killa, number 14!

15:03.069 --> 15:07.062
Contestant Killa, number 14...

15:07.282 --> 15:10.820
Oh, the pairings for the
first round have started!

15:14.038 --> 15:17.530
Next is Contestant Kibito. Please...

15:22.547 --> 15:25.163
Let's see, number 7.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.005
Contestant Kibito, number 7.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.050
Contestant Kuririn!

15:33.266 --> 15:35.598
Huh? Oh, me?

15:38.354 --> 15:41.187
Please, let it be a good number.

15:42.734 --> 15:46.022
Number 1! I'm in the leadoff match?

15:46.237 --> 15:48.273
Contestant Great Saiyaman!

15:48.489 --> 15:49.990
Right!

15:55.455 --> 15:56.945
Number 8.

15:58.291 --> 15:58.529
"Great Saiyaman"

15:59.208 --> 16:00.118
" Kibito "

16:02.879 --> 16:04.619
You'd best be on your guard around him.

16:04.839 --> 16:07.080
I don't think he's your ordinary customer.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.542
R-Right. He does give off
that sense, doesn't he?

16:10.762 --> 16:14.630
Next up... er, Contestant No. 18?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.352
What is your name, then?

16:18.561 --> 16:21.348
It doesn't really matter, does it?

16:26.736 --> 16:28.351
Number 9.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.395
Contestant Shin!

16:31.616 --> 16:33.106
Yes...

16:40.124 --> 16:41.625
Number 3.

16:50.176 --> 16:54.761
Shin, huh? I sure ain't ever
heard that name before.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.679
Hey, Goten, what's this guy's name?

16:57.892 --> 17:00.258
Hmm? I don't know that.

17:00.478 --> 17:03.891
Next is Contestant Spopovitch. Go ahead.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.646
Uh...

17:06.858 --> 17:09.851
Contestant Spopovitch, go ahead!

17:11.071 --> 17:14.906
Hey, there's no answer!
Could Spopovitch be this guy?

17:15.117 --> 17:16.278
Yeah, it has to be.

17:16.493 --> 17:17.825
Hurry and get going!

17:18.037 --> 17:19.446
U-Uh-huh.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.825
Spopovitch-san?

17:22.040 --> 17:24.656
Yes! Coming right now!

17:24.877 --> 17:27.835
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

17:28.047 --> 17:30.129
I wonder which one I'll get.

17:30.341 --> 17:33.674
Hmm? You're Mighty Mask-san, aren't you?

17:35.221 --> 17:36.722
Move it!

17:38.057 --> 17:39.593
I'm Spopovitch!

17:39.809 --> 17:41.595
Oh, sorry.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.140
Ow-w-w-w!

17:46.733 --> 17:50.191
You stupid jerk! You embarrassed us,
you know! What are you doing?!

17:50.403 --> 17:54.146
What do you mean? Trunks-kun,
you told me to, didn't you?

17:55.992 --> 18:00.656
Spopovitch-san, you certainly
have changed a lot since last time.

18:00.872 --> 18:03.579
I didn't recognize you.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.998
Let's see, number 6.

18:06.210 --> 18:09.748
Darn it! That sicko-looking bald dude

18:09.964 --> 18:11.955
should have just answered right away!

18:12.175 --> 18:14.541
Next is Contestant Jewel.

18:18.848 --> 18:19.883
Number 16.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.590
Right, Contestant Jewel is number 16.

18:23.728 --> 18:26.470
Oh, it's Jewel! He's the
champion from my town!

18:26.689 --> 18:29.977
He's extremely strong! He's bound to win!

18:30.193 --> 18:34.687
Idiot! There's no way he can beat Mister Satan!

18:34.906 --> 18:37.648
Goku-sa's not up there yet?

18:37.867 --> 18:40.028
I've gotta have him win it all, no matter what.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.326
Well, victory is a matter of fate.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.574
Vegeta and Piccolo are in it, too, after all.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.658
Pa! This is no time to be sayin' that!

18:47.877 --> 18:49.708
Our way of life is dependin' on this!

18:49.921 --> 18:53.914
Goten had his victory stolen away
by Trunks' dirty tricks!

18:54.133 --> 18:57.045
So now, we've got to have Goku-sa win it all

18:57.261 --> 18:59.843
and come back with all that prize money!

19:00.056 --> 19:03.719
Geez, our household is so strapped
for money, we're about to snap!

19:03.935 --> 19:06.472
All right, Son Goku-san!

19:06.687 --> 19:09.394
Ah, it's my turn. All right...!

19:14.403 --> 19:16.564
I wonder what number I'll get.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.072
Number 11, is it?

19:20.284 --> 19:22.775
Yeah?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.737
I still ain't got a partner, huh?

19:25.957 --> 19:27.447
I wonder who it will be.

19:27.667 --> 19:28.577
Videl-san!

19:28.793 --> 19:30.283
Yes!

19:34.757 --> 19:36.088
What's the story with Papa?

19:36.300 --> 19:40.009
Oh, Mister Satan is taking a little rest.

19:42.265 --> 19:43.050
Number 5.

19:43.266 --> 19:47.555
Hey, did she say Papa?
Is that Mister Satan's daughter?

19:47.770 --> 19:49.761
Y-Yes, that's right.

19:49.981 --> 19:53.394
Oh, yeah? I've heard rumors he had one,
but she doesn't look like him.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.395
She's pretty cute, huh?

19:55.611 --> 19:57.272
W-Well, I suppose she is.

19:57.488 --> 19:58.864
With just a little bit of pressure,

19:59.073 --> 20:01.735
I'll bet she'd let you marry her
in a second, wouldn't she, Gohan?

20:01.951 --> 20:05.569
N-Not at all! W-We're not even
going out with each other!

20:05.788 --> 20:07.824
Look, it's okay, it's okay.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.326
Contestant Punter is number 2.

20:11.335 --> 20:14.827
All right! He's the guy I'm going to get to fight!

20:21.012 --> 20:23.253
Are you the guy named Kuririn?

20:23.472 --> 20:24.723
Yeah, that's me.

20:24.932 --> 20:28.299
I don't show any mercy,
even against scum like you!

20:28.519 --> 20:31.306
I'm gonna crush you to
a quivering, gooey pulp!

20:31.522 --> 20:33.433
Aw, gee whiz.

20:33.649 --> 20:37.358
That is just what a weakling
who's all talk would say, isn't it?

20:37.570 --> 20:39.606
I can see right where this is going. Whoo!

20:39.822 --> 20:41.358
W-What did you say?!

20:41.574 --> 20:43.314
You could just wind up dead!

20:43.534 --> 20:45.695
You'd better write up
your will now, while you can!

20:45.912 --> 20:47.402
And get your coffin ready, too!

20:47.622 --> 20:50.034
I'm gonna make your funeral a real ugly affair!

20:50.249 --> 20:52.626
Next, Contestant Vegeta!

21:00.426 --> 21:02.633
Number 12, right?

21:02.845 --> 21:04.130
Vegeta is number 12?!

21:05.056 --> 21:07.092
Number 12, Contestant Vegeta.

21:07.308 --> 21:10.550
Hey, it's Goku and Vegeta,
right from the start?!

21:10.770 --> 21:13.978
I did it! Kakarrot is my opponent!
I've waited for this.

21:14.190 --> 21:19.059
I've waited for this day--the day
when I gain victory over Kakarrot!

21:19.278 --> 21:21.018
Vegeta, huh?

21:21.113 --> 21:22.273
"(11) Son Goku (12) Vegeta"

21:26.744 --> 21:26.948
This Tenkaichi Budokai will
be an incredible affair now.

21:30.623 --> 21:34.366
The adult division is about to begin!

22:41.819 --> 22:43.275
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:43.487 --> 22:47.230
Whoo! My opponent in
the first round is Vegeta?!

22:47.450 --> 22:49.941
I'm gonna have to stay on my toes for this!

22:50.161 --> 22:51.446
Hmm? What's the matter, Piccolo?

22:51.662 --> 22:55.780
Watch yourself, Goku.
There's something about that Shin guy.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.661
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:57.877 --> 23:01.836
"What Happened, Piccolo?!
An Unexpected Outcome in the First Round."

23:02.048 --> 23:05.461
How can Piccolo-san be so helpless?

23:06.305 --> 23:12.366
