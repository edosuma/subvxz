WEBVTT

00:08.476 --> 00:10.611
GUYS, I HAVE A BAD FEELING.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.684
( martial arts yells )

00:25.193 --> 00:26.727
AAAAH!

00:26.760 --> 00:28.662
( crash )

00:30.331 --> 00:32.031
( Klaxon sounds )

00:34.735 --> 00:37.771
ADAM, THAT WAS
THE REBEL LEADER.

00:37.805 --> 00:41.542
THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF
TODAY'S MISSION SIMULATION
WAS TO INTERROGATE HIM.

00:41.575 --> 00:45.279
I DID, AND HIS ANSWER WAS,
"AAAAAH!"

00:47.615 --> 00:52.620
HEY, NEXT TIME
COULD YOU MAYBE THROW IN
A CUTE, BLUE-EYED REBEL?

00:52.653 --> 00:54.555
WHAT? I'M JUST SAYIN'.
IT'S NOT GONNA KILL YOU

00:54.588 --> 00:58.259
TO ADD A LITTLE
SOMETHIN'-SOMETHIN'
FOR THE LADIES.

00:58.292 --> 01:01.429
STEP ASIDE, AMATEURS.

01:01.462 --> 01:02.796
GO AHEAD, BIG D.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.732
SET IT TO "AWESOME."

01:04.765 --> 01:09.670
LEO, THESE GOGGLES
ARE NOT A TOY.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.473
COME ON!
MY BIRTHDAY'S COMING UP--

01:12.506 --> 01:15.643
GLOBALLY KNOWN
AS "DIA DE LEO."

01:15.676 --> 01:18.612
NO. I DESIGNED
THE MISSION SIMULATOR

01:18.646 --> 01:21.715
TO FINE-TUNE THEIR BIONICS,
NOT TO GO ON 3-D JOYRIDES.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.084
BESIDES, YOU'RE NOT
TRAINED FOR IT.

01:24.118 --> 01:27.555
WELL, HOW ABOUT
AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT

01:27.588 --> 01:30.057
YOU GIVE ME
A BIONIC ABILITY?

01:30.090 --> 01:32.293
OR I COULD GIFT-WRAP REALITY

01:32.326 --> 01:34.128
AND YOU COULD PLAY
WITH THAT FOR A WHILE.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.798
SO LEO'S HAVING A BIRTHDAY.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.301
WHAT ARE YOU, LIKE, NINE?

01:41.735 --> 01:43.704
( laughs )

01:43.737 --> 01:45.839
NO, SERIOUSLY.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.741
SO HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO CELEBRATE?

01:47.775 --> 01:49.643
WE'RE ALL GOING TO
CELEBRATE.

01:49.677 --> 01:52.280
EVERY YEAR MY MOM THROWS ME
A BIG SURPRISE PARTY.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.447
REALLY?

01:53.481 --> 01:56.650
LAST YEAR SHE BAKED A CAKE
THE SIZE OF ME.

01:58.152 --> 02:01.522
I'M NOT GONNA BRAG,
BUT I WAS DELICIOUS.

02:02.890 --> 02:06.360
THE WORLD'S FIRST
 BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.828
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

02:07.861 --> 02:10.231
FASTER, SMARTER.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.766
THE NEXT GENERATION
 OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:12.800 --> 02:14.868
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?!

02:14.902 --> 02:17.137
**

02:19.640 --> 02:20.741
WHOO-HOO!

02:23.577 --> 02:25.379
( all screaming )

02:54.508 --> 02:56.410
GUESS WHAT?
I JUST FOUND OUT

02:56.444 --> 02:59.813
THAT I WON AN AWARD
FOR MY UNDERCOVER REPORTING
ON EXPIRED PRODUCE:

02:59.847 --> 03:02.550
"SOMETHING IN THE CRISPER
CAN KILL YOU."

03:02.583 --> 03:05.286
CONGRATULATIONS!
THAT'S SO GREAT!

03:05.319 --> 03:06.920
OH, THANK YOU.

03:06.954 --> 03:10.358
BUT THE AWARDS BANQUET
IS THE SAME NIGHT AS
LEO'S BIRTHDAY.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.526
I'M SORRY, HONEY.
I'M GONNA MISS IT.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.396
IF I DON'T SHOW UP,
I'M AFRAID THAT THEY'RE
GONNA GIVE MY AWARD

03:15.429 --> 03:18.332
TO THAT OVERDRAMATIC
SCREEN HOG LINDA MONTIERES.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.235
IT'S OKAY, MOM.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.937
GO HAVE FUN.
YOU DESERVE IT.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.541
HEY.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.643
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
GONNA THROW YOU A PARTY.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.545
I WAS PROMISED A PARTY!

03:31.579 --> 03:34.214
EVERY YEAR SHE COMES UP
WITH THIS LAME EXCUSE

03:34.248 --> 03:36.917
TO MAKE ME THINK
SHE'S NOT THROWING ME A PARTY.

03:36.950 --> 03:40.388
AWARD? PLEASE.
HAVE YOU SEEN HER REPORTING?

03:43.324 --> 03:45.593
LEO, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE NOT MAD?

03:45.626 --> 03:47.928
WE'VE NEVER BEEN APART
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.331
OH, PLEASE!
HE'LL HAVE PLENTY OF BIRTHDAYS,

03:50.364 --> 03:52.700
BUT WHO KNOWS IF YOU'LL EVER
WIN ANYTHING AGAIN.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.405
MOM, GO GET YOUR AWARD.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.873
( coughs )
CHOCOLATE FROSTING!

03:59.907 --> 04:02.543
I PROMISE WE WILL CELEBRATE
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.846
HEY, WHY HAVEN'T WE EVER HAD
A BIRTHDAY PARTY?

04:05.879 --> 04:07.548
DONALD!

04:07.581 --> 04:10.318
YOU NEVER CELEBRATED
THEY'RE BIRTHDAYS?

04:10.351 --> 04:13.521
OF COURSE I CELEBRATED
THEIR BIRTHDAYS.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.855
REMEMBER WHEN WE--

04:14.888 --> 04:17.791
WHEN WE WENT TO THE--

04:17.825 --> 04:20.394
YEAH, I NEVER
CELEBRATED THEIR BIRTHDAYS.

04:20.428 --> 04:24.298
DID YOU ALSO EAT
ALL THE COOKIES BEFORE
SANTA CAME DOWN THE CHIMNEY?

04:24.332 --> 04:25.566
WHAT'S SANTA?

04:27.335 --> 04:29.437
OH, COME ON!

04:29.470 --> 04:32.239
AND WHY WOULD YOU
GIVE HIM COOKIES?

04:32.272 --> 04:36.510
THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE BEST BIRTHDAY EVER.

04:36.544 --> 04:40.348
THE SIZE OF THE PARTY
IS EQUAL TO THE SIZE
OF THE EXCUSE.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.983
I'M GONNA GO WORK ON
MY SURPRISED FACE.

04:49.323 --> 04:52.960
WHOO-HOO! LEO'S HAVING
A SURPRISE PARTY!

04:52.993 --> 04:56.029
ADAM, IF LEO WAS HAVING
A SURPRISE PARTY,

04:56.063 --> 04:59.299
DON'T YOU THINK
WE'D BE INVITED?

04:59.333 --> 05:03.537
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHO DOES TASHA THINK SHE IS
NOT INVITING US?

05:03.571 --> 05:06.306
NO. TASHA AND DAVENPORT

05:06.340 --> 05:08.308
REALLY ARE GOING TO
AN AWARDS CEREMONY.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.978
THIS IS HORRIBLE.
LEO'S GONNA BE SO
DISAPPOINTED.

05:11.011 --> 05:14.582
UNLESS WE THROW HIM
A SURPRISE PARTY

05:14.615 --> 05:16.417
AND INVITE
EVERYONE FROM SCHOOL.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.420
WELL, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
THROWING A SURPRISE PARTY?

05:19.453 --> 05:21.555
WELL, IF IT WAS ME,
I'D WANT A BOUNCY HOUSE.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.323
AND A PIÑATA.
WAIT. AND A CLOWN.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.992
NO, WAIT.
PUT THE PIÑATA ON THE CLOWN,

05:25.025 --> 05:27.060
IN THE BOUNCY HOUSE,
AND HIT EVERYTHING AT ONCE.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.464
CANDY'S BOUND TO
COME OUT OF SOMEWHERE.

05:30.498 --> 05:33.367
WHOA!
LET'S INVITE GLITTERHEAD!

05:33.401 --> 05:37.371
YOU KNOW THAT INTERNET STAR
WHO SINGS HER SONGS
IN SIGN LANGUAGE?

05:37.405 --> 05:40.340
YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD
OF HER LATEST CD--
"TALK TO THE HAND."

05:40.374 --> 05:42.443
NO, NO, NO.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.745
LEO WOULD WANT SOMETHING
COOL AT HIS PARTY,

05:44.778 --> 05:48.416
LIKE THOSE SCI-FI MUTANTS FROM
HIS FAVORITE TELEVISION SHOW.

05:48.449 --> 05:51.585
SHARK MAN!
AND FLIPPER BOY!

05:51.619 --> 05:53.987
THAT'S YOUR
FAVORITE TV SHOW.

05:54.021 --> 05:57.024
IT COULD BE HIS ALSO.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.059
YA KNOW,
LEO'S A GREAT BROTHER.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.994
WHY DON'T WE JUST
GIVE HIM ALL THREE?

06:01.028 --> 06:03.397
WHOO-HOO! YEAH!
WE'VE HAVIN' A PARTY!

06:03.431 --> 06:06.767
LEO'S GONNA BE SO SURPRISED.
I'M GONNA GO TELL HIM.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.536
ADAM.

06:08.569 --> 06:12.706
OH, RIGH WELL,
I'M GOING TO GO TELL LEO

06:12.740 --> 06:16.544
HE'S NOT HAVING
A SURPRISE PARTY.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.979
THAT WAS CLOSE.
HE ALMOST FOUND OUT.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.621
WOW! A TUXEDO.

06:27.655 --> 06:31.124
YOU ARE REALLY COMMITTING
TO THIS THING.

06:32.693 --> 06:35.596
LOOK, LEO, I'M REALLY SORRY
WE'RE MISSING YOUR BIRTHDAY.

06:35.629 --> 06:38.732
BUT WAIT TILL YOU SEE

06:38.766 --> 06:44.572
IT IS WHOA-AMAZING-

06:44.605 --> 06:48.141

06:48.175 --> 06:50.911
IS IT A REMOTE-CONTROLLED TANK
UH-HUH.RES REAL LASERS?

06:50.944 --> 06:53.981
IS IT A REAL TANK
THAT FIRUH-HUH. LASERS?

06:54.014 --> 06:56.484
THEN I HOPE YOU

07:05.425 --> 07:08.562
EDDIE. LOOK WHAT I GOT LEO

07:08.596 --> 07:12.833
IT'S A HEXACOPTER.
I SCORED THE ONLY PROTOTYPE

07:12.866 --> 07:16.436
OH, THAT'S SO COOL.
 WANNA KNOW WHAT I GOT HIM?

07:16.470 --> 07:18.205
A BIG BOX OF NOTHING!

07:19.640 --> 07:22.409
COULDA GOT KNOCKED AROUND
A LITTLE IN SHIPPING.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.979
I SHOULD PROBABLY
TEST IT OUT FIRST.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.582
YEAH, OPEN IT!

07:30.217 --> 07:32.786
OH. OOH...

07:34.655 --> 07:36.156
NO REMOTES.

07:36.189 --> 07:39.026
YOU CONTROL IT
WITH YOUR MIND.

Tasha: DONALD!

08:08.556 --> 08:10.190
HEY, LEO,

Leo:
OKAY, HERE I COME!

08:15.529 --> 08:18.599

08:18.632 --> 08:22.536
WELL, I WILL JUST
WALK YOU TO THE DOOR, THEN.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.974
I'M APPROACHING
THE FRONT DOOR.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.511
I HAVE MY HAND
ON THE HANDLE.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.616
I'M GONNA OPEN IT.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.187
SURPRI--

08:44.925 --> 08:48.562
THANKS FOR THE PLAY BY PLAY.
SHALL WE?

08:50.764 --> 08:52.232
GOODBYE, BABY.

08:56.169 --> 09:01.008
OH, I SEE. THEY'RE GONNA
GET IN THE CAR, DRIVE AWAY,

09:01.041 --> 09:04.544
TURN AROUND,
THEN EVERYONE'S GONNA
HOP OUT OF THE BUSHES.

09:06.680 --> 09:10.317
THAT'S RIGHT,
CONVINCINGLY PULL OUT
OF THE DRIVEWAY...

09:12.720 --> 09:16.323
LOOK AT THEM
GETTIN' ON THE FREEWAY
LIKE THEY HAVE SOMEWHERE TO BE.

09:19.627 --> 09:22.696
HEY, WHERE YOU GOIN'?!
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!

09:23.731 --> 09:25.265
WAIT A SECOND.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.135
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET
ALL THESE BALLOONS UPSTAIRS
WITHOUT LEO NOTICING?

09:28.168 --> 09:29.703
OH, NO PROBLEM.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.048
( grunts )

09:45.986 --> 09:49.256
GUYS, MY MOM'S ACTUALLY
GOING TO AN AWARDS BANQUET.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.091
SHE'S NOT THROWING ME
A SURPRISE PARTY.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.694
OH, NO!

09:53.727 --> 09:55.663

10:03.804 --> 10:06.206
EDDIE, WE'RE MOVING
THE PARTY PREP UPSTAIRS.

10:06.239 --> 10:08.676
KEEP LEO IN THE LAB
UNTIL I GIVE YOU THE SIGNAL.

10:08.709 --> 10:12.579
WAIT. SO YOU WANT ME
 TO HOLD THE POOR KID
 AGAINST HIS WILL?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.114
I'M IN!

10:16.750 --> 10:19.286
OH, BUT IF I DID THAT, S.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.022
I'D RUIN THE SURPRISE PARTY
 THEY'RE PLANNING FOR YOU.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.725
THEY'RE THROWING ME
A SURPRISE PARTY?

10:24.758 --> 10:27.795
YEAH, WHAT A BUNCH OF LAME-O's.
 I WOULDN'T EXPECT MUCH.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.368
WELCOME TO LEO'S

10:35.402 --> 10:38.672
WHEN HE COMES UP
REMEMBER TO SCREAM REAL LOUD
AND PRETEND YOU'RE HIS FRIEND.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.143
OH! CHECK IT OUT!

10:43.176 --> 10:45.612
I ORDERED
A BREAK-DANCING CLOWN.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.156

10:56.189 --> 10:58.992

I KNEW THE SECOND

SOMETHING WAS FISHY.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.117
COME ON, GUYS,

11:24.151 --> 11:26.754
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE WAVES.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.891
OKAY, LET'S GO GET LEO.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.161
IT'S GLITTERHEAD!

11:34.194 --> 11:35.763
SHE ACTUALLY CAME

11:35.796 --> 11:39.332
STRAIGHT OFF THE INTERNET
AND INTO MY LIVING ROOM!

11:39.366 --> 11:42.669
I'M NOT GONNA LIE.
SHE'S KIND OF
FREAKIN' ME OUT.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.437

11:51.945 --> 11:54.982
BOUNCY HOUSE

OH, MAN. WHAT'S THIS THING

12:11.865 --> 12:14.067
WHAT IS TAKING THEM SO LONG?

12:14.101 --> 12:16.436
EDDIE, BRING UP
THE GREAT ROOM
ON THE MONITOR.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.841
WHAT?!

12:22.342 --> 12:24.945
NOT UNTIL I GET THE SIGNAL.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.980
OTHERWISE IT COULD
 RUIN THE SURPRISE.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.917
BUT THEY'RE CELEBRATING
WITHOUT ME!

12:29.950 --> 12:32.752
THAT'S NOTHING. WAIT TILL
 THEY START OPENING YOUR GIFTS.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.487

12:34.521 --> 12:36.723

13:33.413 --> 13:34.948
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

13:34.982 --> 13:38.485
SO YOU GUYS HAD
A SURPRISE PARTY FOR LEO...

13:38.518 --> 13:40.820
WITHOUT LEO.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.991
( laughing )
THAT'S--

13:44.024 --> 13:45.993
THAT'S ACTUALLY
KIND OF FU--

13:46.026 --> 13:47.827
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

13:47.861 --> 13:51.064
OKAY, WELL, UH,
LEO'S GONNA BE UP HERE
IN JUST A FEW SECONDS.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.000
WHY DON'T WE ACT LIKE
THE PARTY'S STILL GOING ON,

13:53.033 --> 13:55.035
TRY IT.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.339
All: SURPRISE!

13:59.372 --> 14:02.209
( noiseWHOO!s toot )

14:05.045 --> 14:09.082
I THOUGHT
MY FIRST BIRTHDAY WITH YOU GUYS
WAS GONNA BE AWESOME.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.184
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT PROBABLY WAS.

14:11.218 --> 14:14.221
BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW,
BECAUSE I WASN'T INVITED!

14:20.527 --> 14:22.963
HONEY, I KNOW YOUR BIRTHDAY
WAS A BIT OF A BUST,

14:22.996 --> 14:25.265
BUT I THINK I KNOW
WHAT WILL MAKE IT BETTER.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.200
DONALD,
GIVE HIM YOUR GIFT.

14:30.971 --> 14:34.174
YEAH, BIG D. MAYBE YOUR
AWESOME-TASTICAL GIFT
CAN CHEER ME UP

14:34.207 --> 14:36.509
AFTER BEING TOTALLY FORGOTTEN!

14:37.911 --> 14:40.213
WHAT, THAT GIFT?
YOU DON'T WANT THAT GIFT.

14:40.247 --> 14:44.184
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST GIVE ME THE NUMBER
THAT'LL KEEP THE TEARS BACK.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.053
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

14:46.086 --> 14:48.421
MR. DAVENPORT,
JUST GIVE HIM YOUR GIFT.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.958
YOU KNOW, I WOULD,
BUT I FORGOT WHERE IT WAS.

14:50.991 --> 14:54.361
OH, NO, IT'S RIGHT HERE.
IT'S IN THE CLOSET BEHIND
A BUNCH OF STUFF.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.529
THANKS, ADAM. GOOD EYE.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.034
AAAH...

15:01.068 --> 15:03.170
( laughing )

15:05.272 --> 15:07.140
( stops laughing )

15:11.044 --> 15:13.646
WELL, GREAT, LEO.
YOU BROKE IT.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.553
I AM THE WORST DAD EVER.

15:22.089 --> 15:25.125
WELL, DON'T ALL DISAGREE
WITH ME AT ONCE.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.529
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GONNA GLUE
THIS HEXACOPTER BACK TOGETHER.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.898
WELL, YEAH, SURE.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.067
NOW HE'LL FORGIVE YOU,
BUT WHAT ABOUT US?

15:34.101 --> 15:36.069
GUYS, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE NOTICED,

15:36.103 --> 15:38.105
BUT I'M KIND OF IN
THE "ME" BUSINESS.

15:40.073 --> 15:44.044
I FEEL TERRIBLE.
WE SHOULD HAVE JUST DONE
WHAT LEO WANTED.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.013
WAIT A SECOND.

15:46.046 --> 15:50.083
WHAT LEO REALLY WANTED
WAS TO GO ON A MISSION WITH US
IN THE SIMULATOR.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.485
SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
HE'S GONNA DO.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.387
BUT MR. DAVENPORT
SAID WE COULDN'T.

15:54.421 --> 15:57.257
WE'LL JUST SWIPE
THE CYBER KEY AWAY
FROM MR. DAVENPORT

15:57.290 --> 16:00.027
SO WE CAN START
THE SIMULATOR OURSELVES.

16:00.060 --> 16:04.497
THAT IS SNEAKY, CONNIVING,
AND TOTALLY REBELLIOUS.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.234
WE ARE FINALLY
NORMAL TEENAGERS!

16:12.005 --> 16:13.006
(whispering) OKAY,

16:13.040 --> 16:15.275
MR. DAVENPORT KEEPS
THE CYBER KEY

16:15.308 --> 16:17.177
ON THE LEFT SIDE
OF HIS DESK.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.246
IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS,
WE HAVE TO BE STILL.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.547
I GOT THIS.

16:23.050 --> 16:26.253
HELLO,
MR. DAVENPORT.

16:26.286 --> 16:30.157
LOOK AT YOU,
PLAYING WITH
YOUR BIG BOY TOYS.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.692
HEY, ADAM.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.095
WHAT IS THAT?!

16:35.128 --> 16:39.132
UH, THAT WOULD BE
A WALL, ADAM.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.000
YOU ARE CORRECT, SIR.

16:48.441 --> 16:52.112
LET ME GUESS. YOU'RE GONNA
LOCK ME DOWN HERE
AND GO ON VACATION.

16:52.145 --> 16:56.316
LEO, IT'S TIME FOR
YOUR BIRTHDAY MISSION.

16:58.218 --> 17:01.521
BUT MR. DAVENPORT SAID
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO
PLAY WITH THESE.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.557
BUT MR. DAVENPORT ISN'T HERE.

17:04.590 --> 17:05.791
ALL RIGHT! LET'S GO!

17:08.494 --> 17:09.695
( simulator beeps )

17:13.031 --> 17:14.401
NO OFFENSE, GUYS,

17:14.434 --> 17:17.204
BUT THIS IS A SERIOUSLY
EXPENSIVE LET-DOWN.

17:20.272 --> 17:22.409
HEY HEY! NOW WE'RE TALKIN'!

17:25.212 --> 17:27.079
OH! WHOA! WHOA!

17:27.114 --> 17:28.448
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!

17:28.481 --> 17:30.283
GUYS! A LITTLE HELP HERE!

17:30.317 --> 17:32.285
CHASE,
SHOW HIM HOW IT'S DONE.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.062
LEO, YOU'RE UP!
USE YOUR FORCE FIELD!

17:43.096 --> 17:44.764
WHAT?!
I DON'T HAVE A--

17:45.798 --> 17:46.833
OHH!

17:51.638 --> 17:54.107
I HAVE A FORCE FIELD!

17:54.141 --> 17:56.776
I'M BIONIC!
YES!

17:56.809 --> 17:59.479
YES! FINALLY!

17:59.512 --> 18:02.182
TIME TO GET YOUR BLUR ON.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.355
GO!

18:13.426 --> 18:15.328
WAIT. IF I CAN DO THIS...

18:15.362 --> 18:18.198
GO AHEAD, BIRTHDAY BOY,
THROW ME ACROSS THE ROOM!

18:25.272 --> 18:26.639
HOW DO YOU RESIST
THE TEMPTATION

18:26.673 --> 18:28.408
TO DO THAT TO ME
EVERY DAY?

18:36.816 --> 18:38.718
OH, YOU WANT SOME OF THIS.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.753
WELCOME TO DIA DE LEO!

18:58.338 --> 18:59.706
HEYAHH!

18:59.739 --> 19:01.641
I DON'T UNDERSTAND!

19:01.674 --> 19:05.212
THIS REBEL IS PROGRAMMED
WITH MORE SOPHISTICATED MOVES
THAN I'VE EVER SEEN!

19:09.349 --> 19:12.719
HEY, IT'S NOT COOL TO MAKE ME
LOSE ON DIA DE LEO!

19:12.752 --> 19:15.188
YEAH? AND IT'S NOT COOL

19:15.222 --> 19:18.391
TO STEAL SOMEONE'S
CYBER KEY.

19:18.425 --> 19:21.694
OH, MAN, YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD-LOOKING.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.398
I MEAN, NO OFFENSE.

19:25.432 --> 19:28.435
I'M SURE YOU'RE EYE CANDY
TO OLD PEOPLE.

19:29.669 --> 19:33.206
LEO, I TOLD YOU TO
STAY OUT OF THE SIMULATOR.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.908
YOU'RE NOTBIG D, WATCH OUT!

19:38.345 --> 19:40.313
OR MAYBE YOU ARE.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.615
THAT WAS GREAT, LEO!
AWESOME!

19:42.649 --> 19:45.918
SO DOES THAT MEAN
I GET TO USE THE SIMULATOR
WHENEVER I WANT?

19:45.952 --> 19:50.223
NO! THAT JUST MEANS
I HAVE TO CRANK UP
THE DIFFICULTY ABOUT 100%

19:50.257 --> 19:51.924
TO MAKE IT CHALLENGING
FOR THESE GUYS--

19:51.958 --> 19:54.227
WHO ARE IN BIG TROUBLE.

19:54.261 --> 19:57.364
WE'RE SORRY WE TOOK
YOUR CYBER KEY.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.832
WE HAD TO MAKE IT UP TO LEO
FOR MESSING UP HIS BIRTHDAY.

19:59.866 --> 20:03.202
AND BIG D, IF YOU WOULD HAVE
GIVEN THEM A PARTY OF THEIR OWN,

20:03.236 --> 20:05.505
THEY MAY NOT HAVE
HAD TO HIJACK MINE.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.840
I GOT IT.
BIRTHDAYS MATTER.

20:07.874 --> 20:11.378
YEAH, YOU SHOULD KNOW--
YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH OF 'EM.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.580
WHAT ARE YOU,
LIKE, FIFTY?

20:13.613 --> 20:15.548
I'M THIRTY-EIGHT.

20:15.582 --> 20:16.849
( all laughing )

20:16.883 --> 20:18.318
NO, SERIOUSLY.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.853
HA HA.

20:20.887 --> 20:24.391
OKAY, WHO'S UP FOR SOME
KICK-BOXING ON MARS?

20:24.424 --> 20:25.525
YEAH!

20:25.558 --> 20:27.594
SEE, THIS IS WHAT
BIRTHDAYS ARE ABOUT--

20:27.627 --> 20:29.396
KICKIN' BUTT AS A FAMILY.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.332
COME HERE.
IT'S TIME FOR A HUG.

20:37.504 --> 20:41.441
THIS PLACE IS NEVER
GONNA STOP BEING WEIRD.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.350
ALL RIGHT, LEO.
I KNOW...

20:50.383 --> 20:52.919

20:52.952 --> 20:56.289

20:56.323 --> 20:58.425
AND I REVERSE-ENGINEERED

20:58.458 --> 21:00.960

21:03.830 --> 21:05.398

21:32.359 --> 21:34.861

THINKING?!

21:34.894 --> 21:38.965
I WAS THINKING
I HOPE IT DOESN'T
CRASH INTO THAT WALL.
