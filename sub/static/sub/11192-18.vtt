00:25.600 --> 00:32.100
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your
colonel speaking. Welcome to... P3X-989,

00:31.919 --> 00:35.618
where it's a balmy... room temperature.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.634
Fan it out.

00:49.877 --> 00:51.252
Whoa.

00:55.555 --> 00:59.008
Well, the lights are on
but there's nobody home.

00:58.956 --> 01:02.953
The technology's advanced compared
to most human-inhabited planets,

01:02.875 --> 01:04.950
maybe even more advanced than Earth.

01:04.953 --> 01:09.533
<i>- How much more?
- Well, it feels older, somehow.</i>

01:09.433 --> 01:12.103
I know how it feels.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.150
This place has seen better days.

01:22.591 --> 01:24.834
It doesn't appear to be of Goa'uld origin.

01:24.832 --> 01:28.617
<i>- Teal'c, ever see anythin' like it?
- I have not.</i>

01:44.030 --> 01:46.105
A computer.

01:52.348 --> 01:55.219
Well, that sounds ominous.
Let's fall back.

03:18.378 --> 03:21.877
- What the hell...?
- Colonel?

03:23.217 --> 03:25.838
- Carter?
- Whoa.

03:27.056 --> 03:29.215
How'd we get into these outfits?

03:29.217 --> 03:31.294
I don't know.

03:34.576 --> 03:37.412
Welcome to PX3-989.

03:37.376 --> 03:39.617
<i>The transmitter's gone.</i>

03:49.534 --> 03:51.610
<i>Daniel?</i>

03:52.414 --> 03:55.250
Teal'c! You guys OK?

03:55.694 --> 03:58.233
- I am well.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

03:59.813 --> 04:04.191
Better than fine, actually, when you
consider the fact that we were just...

04:06.731 --> 04:09.981
Ah! Com-traya!

04:14.971 --> 04:17.259
Com-traya!

04:17.690 --> 04:21.106
- Daniel?
- I think that's a greeting.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.207
Yes. It is.

04:24.730 --> 04:28.098
Oh, well, then, um...

04:28.970 --> 04:32.718
Com-traya! We are explorers
from a place called Earth.

04:32.928 --> 04:35.218
I'm Daniel. Hello.

04:35.209 --> 04:37.367
Oh! This is your custom, yes?

04:37.369 --> 04:39.444
Hello!

04:39.449 --> 04:43.067
- You are the leader?
- Oh, no. That would be...

04:43.007 --> 04:46.459
Me. Colonel Jack O'Neill. Kum Ba Yah.

04:47.968 --> 04:50.588
- Com-traya.
- Whatever.

04:50.567 --> 04:52.939
- Why'd you attack us?
- Attack?

04:53.728 --> 04:57.560
Oh, attack. Yes, of course. It would
seem that way from your perspective.

04:57.485 --> 04:59.562
Yes. I did that.

05:01.086 --> 05:03.161
- Why?
- It could not be helped.

05:03.165 --> 05:05.454
Oh, are you suffering any pain?

05:05.446 --> 05:08.696
Aftereffects?
Occasionally the heart must be restarted.

05:08.646 --> 05:11.100
Uh, no. I think we feel fine.

05:11.084 --> 05:13.161
Oh, com-traya!

05:13.923 --> 05:16.759
You are all such wonderful specimens.

05:16.723 --> 05:19.393
You in particular. A female.

05:20.082 --> 05:22.538
- Colonel?
- Easy, Captain.

05:24.922 --> 05:29.250
Listen, we had some things
when we got here - some weapons.

05:29.481 --> 05:32.850
Oh, those. Mm, yes. Very dangerous.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.790
Very. Can we have them back?

05:35.762 --> 05:37.968
And our uniforms?

05:37.961 --> 05:41.081
Sorry, but they are gone.
This is better, yes?

05:41.040 --> 05:43.117
- No.
- Um...

05:43.680 --> 05:45.757
I am Harlan.

05:46.840 --> 05:50.209
I am the last survivor of Altair.

05:50.319 --> 05:53.487
Excuse me? The last survi...?

05:55.279 --> 05:58.149
- You're the only one on this planet?
- Yes.

05:58.759 --> 06:01.925
And your weapons are this way.

06:19.636 --> 06:23.384
<i>We are in section three.
There has been trouble here lately.</i>

06:23.315 --> 06:25.557
<i>- What kind?
- Mechanical breakdowns.</i>

06:25.555 --> 06:28.225
Very difficult to maintain
this complex all alone.

06:28.194 --> 06:32.144
Listen, Harlan.
Is there an outside to this place?

06:32.514 --> 06:35.800
- Outside is above. We are under.
- Under... the surface?

06:35.754 --> 06:38.293
Oh, yes. On the surface
we could not survive.

06:38.274 --> 06:40.978
Mm. Radiation. Very, very bad.

06:40.954 --> 06:43.954
Ah! This way to section four.

06:43.913 --> 06:46.665
<i>Um... what happened
to your civilisation?</i>

06:46.632 --> 06:50.002
Surely you started on the surface
and then moved under?

06:49.952 --> 06:52.028
Oh, yes. Long ago.

06:52.031 --> 06:56.029
We're curious about other worlds. We'd
love to hear what happened up there.

06:55.951 --> 06:59.403
- All in time.
- We've got all the time in the world.

06:59.350 --> 07:02.637
Yes, you do. You understand. Com-traya!

07:02.591 --> 07:06.504
What is that? "Com-traya"?
Is that like "aloha"?

07:06.430 --> 07:09.466
Harlan, how long have you
been on your own?

07:09.430 --> 07:11.920
Ah, now, let me see.

07:11.910 --> 07:16.204
Wallace was the last one to go.
I miss him.

07:16.108 --> 07:19.026
But you all remind me a little of Wallace.

07:18.987 --> 07:22.439
Um... except for you, of course.
You are female.

07:22.387 --> 07:25.507
And you are... whatever you are.

07:28.788 --> 07:32.406
Hubald. He was the creator of all this.

07:32.346 --> 07:36.723
But he died very early. Too early.
Took many secrets with him. So long ago.

07:36.627 --> 07:38.915
How long... exactly?

07:38.906 --> 07:43.781
Uh, exactly? 99,207,000 of your hours.

07:45.266 --> 07:47.591
That's 11,000 years.

07:47.584 --> 07:49.707
How did you know that?

07:51.223 --> 07:52.884
It's right?

07:54.343 --> 07:57.215
<i>- Yeah.
- Wait. How did you know that?</i>

07:57.903 --> 08:02.197
See? Everything is better, even your
minds. You are all much, much better.

08:02.103 --> 08:05.935
- Better than what?
- Do you not feel it? Are you not stronger?

08:05.862 --> 08:09.562
- Smarter?
- Jack, I think he's right. I feel great.

08:09.502 --> 08:12.502
Of course you do.
Because I have given you a great gift!

08:12.461 --> 08:16.709
- I have made you all... better!
- Better how?

08:16.622 --> 08:20.038
Oh, I have not hurt you.
I have only made you... better!

08:19.980 --> 08:22.935
All right. Listen. Listen closely.

08:22.901 --> 08:25.735
I'm gonna ask you
one more time, very simply.

08:27.819 --> 08:30.228
Better... how?

08:37.499 --> 08:40.664
- We're gone. We're outta here.
- Wh...

08:50.456 --> 08:52.580
Carter, dial us home.

08:56.496 --> 08:58.620
<i>Wait! You...</i>

09:00.696 --> 09:03.566
You cannot leave!
I cannot leave either. It is unsafe.

09:03.535 --> 09:06.240
<i>What isn't safe? Tell us.</i>

09:06.215 --> 09:09.667
All in time. There is
so much you must know first.

09:13.614 --> 09:16.187
Oh... If...

09:16.774 --> 09:19.230
You will be back! You will!

09:19.213 --> 09:22.130
You cannot leave me here all...

09:22.493 --> 09:24.568
alone!

09:27.092 --> 09:29.168
Oh, dear.

09:33.011 --> 09:36.677
- Colonel, how do you feel?
- Never felt better in my life.

09:37.932 --> 09:43.222
<i>- It's got me a little worried, actually.
- Well, this has got me a little worried.</i>

09:43.091 --> 09:45.167
Listen.

09:52.610 --> 09:54.686
I don't hear anything.

09:56.849 --> 09:59.422
What, this is better? I'm dead?

09:59.408 --> 10:04.118
Look, Colonel, to make sense of this
I'm gonna have to do a blood sample.

10:23.046 --> 10:26.212
My God. What the hell is that?
Get that outta me.

10:27.286 --> 10:29.859
Look, uh, I'm gonna need
x- rays on all of them.

10:29.845 --> 10:33.345
- What did he do to us?
- I don't know. Just let's stay calm.

10:34.524 --> 10:36.980
I no longer possess a Goa'uld.

10:41.643 --> 10:44.809
- Colonel, what the hell are you doing?
- Colonel!

10:59.402 --> 11:01.477
My God.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.942
<i>Alert. Security to the infirmary.</i>

11:05.921 --> 11:08.412
Whoa! Security? Dr. Fraiser, it is us.

11:08.399 --> 11:11.686
Just don't come any closer.

11:19.359 --> 11:22.894
Stand down, airmen. It's a little
misunderstanding. That's an order.

11:22.838 --> 11:25.710
Belay that order.

11:27.038 --> 11:32.412
- General, that is not Colonel O'Neill.
- Oh, for cryin' out loud. General, it's me.

11:33.038 --> 11:35.873
Would you call that human blood?

11:36.557 --> 11:38.679
I believe they're all impostors.

11:38.677 --> 11:42.211
He, or whatever he is,
has no detectable heartbeat.

11:42.836 --> 11:47.000
- Take them to the holding room. Guard it.
- General Hammond.

11:48.355 --> 11:52.019
- I don't know what that son of a bitch did.
- Follow the instructions...

11:51.956 --> 11:54.576
- Your wife died of cancer.
- ...and you will not be hurt.

11:54.554 --> 11:56.298
Your granddaughters
are Tessa and Kayla.

11:56.313 --> 12:01.653
Any resistance by any of you will be met
with deadly force. Is that understood?

12:05.274 --> 12:07.350
Understood.

12:08.113 --> 12:10.188
Perfectly.

12:27.230 --> 12:29.437
Looks and sounds like our people.

12:29.429 --> 12:34.176
- They certainly believe they're SG-1.
- It may be another Goa'uld trick.

12:34.828 --> 12:36.904
I don't know what to believe.

12:36.909 --> 12:39.826
He was right about
the names of my grandchildren.

12:39.788 --> 12:42.077
How would he know
if he isn't Jack O'Neill?

12:42.068 --> 12:46.897
Given our history with the Goa'uld,
keeping them here would be dangerous.

12:48.388 --> 12:51.092
I'll take that under advisement, Doctor.

12:55.386 --> 12:59.052
It's incredible. It looks like mine,
it feels like mine. It is mine.

12:58.986 --> 13:03.197
I mean, I don't feel any different.
If anything, I feel better.

13:03.105 --> 13:06.854
- That's what Harlan said.
- Why didn't he just tell us?

13:06.785 --> 13:10.865
- Probably afraid we'd damage him.
- Perceptive little runt.

13:10.784 --> 13:14.368
You know, Colonel, you can't blame
General Hammond for confining us.

13:14.304 --> 13:17.091
Hey. I know who I am.

13:17.065 --> 13:20.765
Well, so do I. In every respect
I feel like Sam Carter.

13:20.703 --> 13:25.865
But the evidence... Harlan must have
transferred our consciousness

13:25.744 --> 13:27.735
- Into these bodies.
- Bodies?

13:27.743 --> 13:30.234
Did you see the inside of this arm?

13:31.102 --> 13:33.854
We're machines, Carter.

13:34.461 --> 13:37.034
Teal'c, are you OK?

13:37.022 --> 13:39.097
Why?

13:40.461 --> 13:47.460
Well... for starters,
you've lost your... infant Goa'uld.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.966
- I still feel its presence.
- Really?

13:50.940 --> 13:55.731
That must be like continuing
to feel a limb after it's been... lost.

13:55.620 --> 13:57.696
Oh, for cryin' out loud. Daniel!

13:58.619 --> 14:04.490
I'm glad you're so fascinated by all this,
but it's time for a little reality check, OK?

14:06.057 --> 14:08.845
We are being held prisoner
by our own people.

14:09.057 --> 14:12.390
- They can't keep us in here for ever...
- Why not?

14:12.337 --> 14:14.828
What do you think is gonna happen?

14:14.817 --> 14:19.195
You really think military intelligence
is gonna let us continue as SG-1 like this?

14:19.096 --> 14:22.097
- We still have our rights, Jack.
- What rights?

14:22.056 --> 14:24.760
No matter what
he's done to us, we're still...

14:24.735 --> 14:27.903
Human?
Is that what you were gonna say?

14:30.975 --> 14:33.051
Harlan said we'd be back.

14:35.134 --> 14:37.211
Now we know why.

14:51.212 --> 14:53.620
Colonel O'Neill... Whoever you are.

14:53.613 --> 14:58.274
I have decided to send SG-5 to PX3-989
to see if they can shed some light on this.

14:58.173 --> 14:59.667
- That's a mistake.
- Why?

14:59.692 --> 15:03.191
- Harlan'll do to them what he did to us.
- Harlan?

15:04.171 --> 15:07.337
The indigenous person
we encountered on the other side, sir.

15:07.289 --> 15:11.917
We do believe that he transferred our
consciousness into these artificial bodies.

15:11.809 --> 15:15.510
- Why would anyone do that?
- He thought he was doing us a favour.

15:15.450 --> 15:18.653
He thinks this is "better".

15:19.570 --> 15:23.187
I never thought about it at the time,
but he must be artificial too.

15:23.129 --> 15:25.620
It would explain
how he got to be 11,000 years old.

15:25.609 --> 15:27.684
- What?
- General.

15:28.447 --> 15:31.365
I think it's imperative that we go back...

15:34.246 --> 15:36.738
- Get Dr. Fraiser!
- Yes, sir!

15:42.647 --> 15:45.138
General, we've gotta go back.

15:50.884 --> 15:55.511
- We'll send another team within the hour.
- Negative! Don't risk any more.

15:55.403 --> 15:57.480
Get this gate open.

16:13.922 --> 16:16.163
<i>My strength returns.</i>

16:16.163 --> 16:19.532
<i>- We ran out of energy.
- What?</i>

16:19.481 --> 16:24.688
Well, if these bodies are machines,
they need a power source. It's here.

16:24.562 --> 16:27.182
Ah!

16:27.640 --> 16:29.716
Com-traya!

16:30.559 --> 16:34.259
Here is where you belong now.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.948
Here is the only place you can be.

16:41.078 --> 16:44.662
You son of a bitch!

16:44.599 --> 16:47.802
You nearly waited too long.
I was worried. Feel better?

16:47.758 --> 16:51.922
- Better? What the hell did you do to us?
- You are angry.

16:51.837 --> 16:56.334
Yes! Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't break you in half!

16:56.238 --> 16:59.441
Only he can put our consciousness
back into our bodies.

16:59.397 --> 17:01.721
Oh, no, no, no. I cannot do that.

17:01.716 --> 17:05.382
In time you will see. I have transferred
your consciousness to the synthetic.

17:05.315 --> 17:09.182
- Well, transfer us back, now!
- No, I cannot. It is permanent.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.689
I do not wanna hear that!

17:11.674 --> 17:14.248
You are damaging me.

17:22.913 --> 17:26.116
I am sorry, but there is no way
to do what you ask.

17:26.074 --> 17:29.656
Your bodies are all gone.
It is all part of the process.

17:29.593 --> 17:32.262
This is what you are now!

17:35.271 --> 17:38.439
You will see. It is better!

17:52.950 --> 17:56.318
This way. Around the corner.

17:56.269 --> 18:00.932
Just a few more steps and home again!

18:00.829 --> 18:04.992
You should all rest now. Your internal
systems are not yet fully recharged,

18:04.909 --> 18:07.614
and they were allowed
to drain far too low.

18:11.987 --> 18:13.528
<i>Attention.</i>

18:13.547 --> 18:17.378
<i>Coolant leak
in secondary coiI, section two.</i>

18:17.307 --> 18:19.596
<i>Immediate attention is required.</i>

18:19.586 --> 18:21.744
Section two.
You see now why I needed you?

18:21.746 --> 18:24.865
This place is more
than one man can maintain.

18:26.067 --> 18:28.023
There's so much to do.

18:28.026 --> 18:31.976
You will see.
You will all feel much better soon.

18:31.904 --> 18:34.478
This will not take long at all.

18:44.544 --> 18:49.039
Jack, he said we should rest.
You don't wanna run out of energy again.

18:51.262 --> 18:53.551
He was right about this place.

18:53.542 --> 18:57.208
Half the stuff in this complex
isn't working, the rest is marginal.

18:57.143 --> 19:01.141
Look around. He's been
jerry-rigging things for centuries.

19:01.821 --> 19:04.989
- He was desperate.
- I say let the place fall down.

19:06.461 --> 19:10.078
To condemn Harlan would be
to condemn ourselves.

19:10.019 --> 19:12.261
Your point being?

19:13.660 --> 19:16.826
- What is done is done.
- Oh, please.

19:17.420 --> 19:21.369
Has it occurred to anyone
that all we are now is robots?

19:30.897 --> 19:33.815
- Where are you going?
- To find Harlan. Don't worry!

19:33.778 --> 19:37.644
Just to talk. Robot to robot.

19:44.977 --> 19:47.182
- What?
- Oh, it's nothing.

19:49.775 --> 19:55.279
Um... The notion of living 11,000 years
entered my mind for a moment,

19:55.134 --> 19:57.211
and I couldn't...

19:58.255 --> 20:00.330
It's a lot to take in.

20:00.973 --> 20:03.464
Apparently, we've got time to adjust.

20:05.214 --> 20:10.635
We really have the same sensations and
perceptions we did in our human form.

20:10.492 --> 20:13.613
Well, if you think about it,
the human body is just a machine.

20:13.574 --> 20:17.819
It's just a vessel for our consciousness.
I mean, it's just an organic one.

20:17.731 --> 20:21.183
- I mean, it performs work, requires fuel.
- It's not the same.

20:21.131 --> 20:24.500
No, it isn't, but...
Maybe, in a way, Harlan was right.

20:24.451 --> 20:27.238
Maybe this is... better.

20:28.490 --> 20:33.484
I mean, we're still us, we're still unique.
I mean, every thought, every feeling...

20:33.371 --> 20:36.656
Have you felt hungry or thirsty
since this happened?

20:36.611 --> 20:38.686
No.

20:40.048 --> 20:42.719
Teal'c!

20:42.689 --> 20:44.765
You still OK?

20:57.567 --> 21:00.402
- Where'd he go?
- He probably wants to be alone.

21:00.366 --> 21:03.782
I don't blame him. That way.

21:31.923 --> 21:36.251
I do not understand
this obsession of yours.

21:36.162 --> 21:40.539
It's not an obsession. I just wanna know
what you did with our bodies.

21:40.442 --> 21:45.353
You have no further use for them.
Oh, good. You are exploring.

21:45.240 --> 21:49.191
Yes, good, good. There is much to see.
Much to learn from the station.

21:49.121 --> 21:51.576
And you are feeling better, yes?

21:51.560 --> 21:54.182
No. Colonel, have you seen Teal'c?

21:55.161 --> 21:57.366
I left him with you.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.932
Perhaps he is best left alone.

22:01.440 --> 22:06.148
<i>- He is... different, yes?
- Yes!</i>

22:06.038 --> 22:10.117
Look, Harlan, I wanna know why
you did this. Why you did all of this.

22:17.836 --> 22:20.507
Our race was facing destruction.

22:20.477 --> 22:23.810
The biosphere of this planet
could no longer support us.

22:23.756 --> 22:27.208
This project was undertaken
to allow some of our people to live,

22:27.155 --> 22:29.278
even if our planet could not.

22:29.276 --> 22:32.692
Our former bodies would...
never have survived this.

22:32.635 --> 22:35.092
- How many were there originally?
- Uh...

22:35.076 --> 22:37.648
- A thousand.
- What happened to them?

22:37.634 --> 22:40.969
There were problems with
the transfer process. Some were lost.

22:40.914 --> 22:44.532
Sekura, Marith, Tira. Very, very sad.

22:44.473 --> 22:49.931
We could not repair Hubald, the creator
of all this. His secrets were lost.

22:49.792 --> 22:55.084
- But many survived... for a while.
- Where are they?

22:54.952 --> 22:58.617
Some left through the ring we discovered,
the ring you went through.

22:58.551 --> 23:02.930
They carried smaller, more portable
power sources with them.

23:02.832 --> 23:05.323
I expected them to come home. I waited.

23:06.031 --> 23:09.401
This is home, after all.

23:09.352 --> 23:11.428
But they... didn't.

23:12.990 --> 23:18.696
And the rest did not accept the gift.
They... ended their existence.

23:19.630 --> 23:21.705
How?

23:21.949 --> 23:24.355
They walked above the surface,
far from here,

23:24.348 --> 23:26.637
outside of the range of the power source.

23:26.628 --> 23:32.632
Wallace, he was the last one. He gave
his life for this station. An accident.

23:32.469 --> 23:36.762
And I have been alone since Wallace.

23:36.666 --> 23:39.288
But you are here now.

23:39.268 --> 23:42.055
And everything is better now.

23:44.786 --> 23:47.656
Will you hold this for me?

24:04.224 --> 24:06.976
Com-traya! Very helpful.

24:06.943 --> 24:11.023
We work together well. There, see?
We accomplish things.

24:11.383 --> 24:16.721
So, we must remain near the power
source in case it breaks down again.

24:16.582 --> 24:19.618
Without the continuous
stream of energy from the emitter,

24:19.583 --> 24:22.998
these bodies could not function
for more than a few hours.

24:22.942 --> 24:27.153
That is why I knew you would come back.

24:27.060 --> 24:30.310
Harlan, we want to go home.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.633
Oh, no, no. You must stay.
You are friends.

24:32.621 --> 24:34.827
New friends!

24:35.820 --> 24:38.941
Friends? I don't even like you.

24:38.901 --> 24:41.936
- Chances are, I'll never like you.
- Colonel.

24:42.898 --> 24:46.315
If we are ever going home, we need him.

24:46.259 --> 24:51.882
You still do not appreciate the gift.
Immortality.

24:52.978 --> 24:55.550
11,000 going on infinity, I always say.

24:58.457 --> 25:01.375
<i>Attention. Coolant leak in primary coiI.</i>

25:01.336 --> 25:03.958
Very bad. Very bad.

25:04.656 --> 25:08.155
- What is it?
- The power source... for us.

25:08.375 --> 25:11.826
I spent too much time away from
repairing the station to create you.

25:11.776 --> 25:16.604
Hurry. There's not much time.
We must repair it or else we will all... die!

25:25.453 --> 25:29.582
I think the thermal capacitator
has malfunctioned again.

25:29.493 --> 25:30.442
Aha.

25:30.493 --> 25:34.409
Tube 18 is blocked.
It draws heat in from the planetary core.

25:34.333 --> 25:39.161
It must be vented. The wind drives
irradiated rain into the ventilation system.

25:39.052 --> 25:41.342
It rusts the valves closed.

25:42.133 --> 25:45.798
- So what's keeping us going?
- Reserve power, like when you went...

25:45.731 --> 25:47.807
<i>Not much time!</i>

25:47.810 --> 25:50.017
Has this ever happened before?

25:50.010 --> 25:52.217
Not since Wallace was still alive.

25:52.211 --> 25:55.626
It is the reason I created you.
We must work together.

25:55.570 --> 25:57.362
Please help!

26:04.568 --> 26:06.644
All right. I'll help.

26:09.847 --> 26:14.723
- Where's Teal'c? We could use him.
- It does not matter. He is... different.

26:14.807 --> 26:19.055
- OK, so what do we do?
- I had to shut down most of the vents.

26:18.968 --> 26:22.171
We have to open more
and reroute the ventilation.

26:23.606 --> 26:25.682
There and there.

26:25.686 --> 26:28.521
I will stay here to operate the computer.

26:28.486 --> 26:30.894
How do we find these vents?
How do we open them?

26:30.885 --> 26:34.550
The automatic controls no longer work.
The vents are rusted closed.

26:34.486 --> 26:38.614
You will have to open up the vent shafts
and do it manually.

26:38.525 --> 26:42.190
Search your minds.
It is all there, I made sure of it.

26:43.444 --> 26:47.064
You have all the answers you need.
Now go! Go!

26:47.003 --> 26:49.079
Go!

26:59.282 --> 27:01.358
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

27:08.681 --> 27:10.757
This way.

27:13.480 --> 27:16.647
<i>Warning. Pressure rising to critical levels.</i>

27:16.881 --> 27:19.750
<i>Pressure level at four Hubald units.</i>

27:36.917 --> 27:40.203
<i>Pressure rising to six Hubald units.</i>

27:41.876 --> 27:43.750
<i>Warning.</i>

27:44.476 --> 27:46.551
There it is.

27:58.315 --> 28:00.391
- Did you see that?
- Daniel.

28:01.355 --> 28:03.431
Oh.

28:09.713 --> 28:11.873
Harlan was right. It's rusted shut.

28:30.310 --> 28:31.342
There. I got it.

28:33.750 --> 28:37.796
<i>Warning.
Pressure rising to eight Hubald units.</i>

28:44.470 --> 28:47.755
<i>Pressure rising to ten Hubald units.</i>

28:48.388 --> 28:51.556
<i>Override anti-steam valve.</i>

28:51.508 --> 28:54.130
Not yet, Harlan, not yet!

28:59.267 --> 29:02.599
Teal'c! Thank God.
Where have you been?

29:13.105 --> 29:15.347
<i>.. twelve Hubald units.</i>

29:17.585 --> 29:19.661
What are you doing?

29:22.263 --> 29:26.593
<i>Catastrophic coolant failure is imminent.</i>

29:31.743 --> 29:33.902
Come on, Teal'c. Come on.

29:34.103 --> 29:35.383
Teal'c!

29:40.103 --> 29:42.179
Teal'c!

29:45.622 --> 29:49.322
<i>You have succeeded
in venting sufficient pressure.</i>

29:49.261 --> 29:51.337
<i>Com-traya!</i>

29:51.340 --> 29:53.583
We did it.

30:09.179 --> 30:11.255
Teal'c! Don't!

30:18.417 --> 30:19.994
Colonel.

30:20.978 --> 30:24.311
- I'm all right.
- I'm sorry, but you're not.

30:24.257 --> 30:26.664
It is only damage. I can repair it.

30:27.777 --> 30:31.028
All will be well. You will see.
And your friend, too.

30:30.977 --> 30:33.134
- What, Teal'c?
- You killed him!

30:33.135 --> 30:35.377
He was malfunctioning.

30:35.375 --> 30:38.459
How will all be well with him if he's dead?

30:38.414 --> 30:43.242
You will see. Now the station is repaired,
go back to your quarters and wait.

30:43.134 --> 30:45.210
You... you will see.

30:47.094 --> 30:49.170
Keep an eye on him.

30:58.811 --> 31:00.887
Harlan! Open up!

31:01.652 --> 31:03.728
Harlan!

31:10.691 --> 31:14.984
- No, no, no, go away!
- Harlan, what the hell are you doing?

31:14.891 --> 31:18.509
- All will be well. Please.
- He's making a new synthetic of Teal'c.

31:18.450 --> 31:21.569
Go back to your quarters
and I will bring him to you.

31:21.529 --> 31:25.777
- How is this possible?
- Ah, yes. There were two minds before.

31:25.690 --> 31:28.015
The creature he carried within.
Two beings.

31:28.009 --> 31:31.876
The two minds could not coexist
and your friend malfunctioned.

31:31.807 --> 31:35.058
I did not know he was different.
I won't make that mistake again.

31:35.008 --> 31:39.301
Answer my question. How can you make
a synthetic Teal'c without the original?

31:39.209 --> 31:41.996
Captain Carter, stand aside.

31:43.126 --> 31:46.826
- Harlan, turn off that machine.
- The process is incomplete.

31:46.766 --> 31:48.842
Turn it off!

31:49.925 --> 31:52.631
Now answer the captain's question.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.564
Please. If you destroy me,

31:54.566 --> 31:58.230
you will destroy the last survivor
of an entire people, and yourselves.

31:58.164 --> 32:00.453
I'm gonna ask this question once.

32:01.286 --> 32:05.828
Do our bodies, our real bodies,
exist somewhere?

32:08.284 --> 32:10.442
Yes.

32:13.123 --> 32:16.657
Then I want you to put us back. Now.

32:16.843 --> 32:19.962
- I could not do that, even if I wanted to.
- Why?

32:20.563 --> 32:23.183
If you can transfer
our consciousness into these bodies,

32:23.162 --> 32:25.367
surely you can reverse the process.

32:25.363 --> 32:28.647
- No. It is impossible.
- Why?

32:31.442 --> 32:33.518
I will show you.

33:17.596 --> 33:23.182
I meant no harm. I would have
returned them through the ring

33:23.034 --> 33:26.403
as soon as I was certain
you had accepted your transference.

33:26.354 --> 33:30.932
Except that it's not really a transference,
is it? From one to the other.

33:31.834 --> 33:34.205
- We're copies.
- Yes.

33:34.193 --> 33:36.863
As good as the original. Better, even.

33:41.152 --> 33:44.686
If you had not been so insistent,
you would never have seen each other.

33:44.632 --> 33:46.339
Once the transfer was successful,

33:46.351 --> 33:50.978
I intended to send your organic selves
back to your world.

33:50.871 --> 33:53.362
Um... Their world.

33:54.391 --> 33:57.260
They would never have known
of your existence.

33:57.230 --> 34:01.097
And, in time, I hoped that
you would have accepted yours.

34:02.750 --> 34:08.206
We... can never go back.

34:08.070 --> 34:10.146
No, you belong here.

34:10.989 --> 34:13.396
You are welcome here.

34:19.588 --> 34:22.161
- Teal'c?
- Captain Carter.

34:22.628 --> 34:24.751
Colonel, he's all right.

34:27.746 --> 34:30.119
That's great, Captain.

34:56.943 --> 34:59.019
- Daniel?
- Uh...

35:00.222 --> 35:02.298
Sort of.

35:08.382 --> 35:10.458
Here, let me get that.

35:17.380 --> 35:19.586
Harlan, where've you been?

35:20.260 --> 35:22.929
- Extremely busy.
- I can see that. Doing what?

35:23.260 --> 35:28.172
Oh, uh... creating your synthetic others,
saving the planet. Busy, busy.

35:34.018 --> 35:36.224
- Synthetic?
- Yes.

35:36.858 --> 35:39.146
Sorry for having
restrained you for so long.

35:39.137 --> 35:42.054
I am afraid my plan
has failed rather... miserably.

35:42.536 --> 35:45.324
But as I promised, you are free to go.

35:48.817 --> 35:51.023
<i>This is impossible.</i>

35:51.016 --> 35:55.181
It's true. At first, we didn't even know
we'd been changed.

35:55.096 --> 36:00.849
- Recreating the neural structure on a...
- It defies the uncertainty principle.

36:00.695 --> 36:03.233
But we are identical.

36:03.614 --> 36:07.742
- Right down to the mole on our...
- Hey, hey, hey. Shut up.

36:09.894 --> 36:13.476
- Was not a copy made of me?
- Oh. Yes. Uh...

36:13.612 --> 36:16.282
Yes, uh... But, uh...

36:17.653 --> 36:20.358
I had to disintegrate you.

36:23.413 --> 36:25.155
I see.

36:26.851 --> 36:31.893
<i>- You get it. You just don't like it.
- Uh, well...</i>

36:31.771 --> 36:36.766
<i>I think, in time, our separate
experiences will make us different.</i>

36:57.528 --> 37:02.405
Listen, I'm not too happy
about this either, you know.

37:02.286 --> 37:04.909
You think you know how I feel?

37:04.887 --> 37:06.963
Well, yeah.

37:07.967 --> 37:11.086
We're basically the same guy, aren't we?

37:11.885 --> 37:14.175
- Have a look.
- Ow.

37:15.646 --> 37:17.521
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

37:19.806 --> 37:23.056
So, um... What the hell happened here?

37:27.284 --> 37:30.320
Somebody stole my life.
That's what happened.

37:30.284 --> 37:32.490
- You talking about my life?
- Hey!

37:32.483 --> 37:35.318
I've got every right to it that you do.

37:39.362 --> 37:41.983
I was hopin' I could figure out
a way to undo all this,

37:41.963 --> 37:44.454
get back into my body where I belong.

37:44.443 --> 37:47.478
Well, it's occupied, thank you.

37:47.443 --> 37:49.518
I noticed that.

37:51.362 --> 37:54.278
What does that make me?

38:01.081 --> 38:05.208
- What do you want?
- They're all debating the meaning of life.

38:05.119 --> 38:10.327
Both Daniels think this is all fascinating.
The Carters are arguing already.

38:10.199 --> 38:12.903
Teal'c feels left out.

38:15.358 --> 38:18.313
You and I have got
a few things to talk about.

38:18.277 --> 38:22.489
I won't give you a hard time about who
gets to go back, if that's what you mean.

38:22.398 --> 38:25.849
- Thank you.
- It has nothing to do with generosity.

38:29.157 --> 38:31.612
I can't go back.

38:31.596 --> 38:35.179
- If I could, it might be a different story.
- Yeah, well...

38:36.356 --> 38:40.603
There is the little issue of security.

38:41.356 --> 38:45.684
You know everything I know
about Earth. Codes, defences.

38:46.594 --> 38:49.050
We'll bury the gate. Don't worry.

38:49.594 --> 38:52.382
Don't even think about
sending a bomb to make sure.

38:52.355 --> 38:55.106
- I wasn't.
- Yes, you were. I know you.

38:57.753 --> 39:01.003
All right. All right.
You have my word... Colonel.

39:02.793 --> 39:05.876
Call me Jack.

39:05.831 --> 39:07.907
<i>Colonel O'Neill?</i>

39:08.793 --> 39:10.869
<i>Oh, for cryin' out loud.</i>

39:11.833 --> 39:13.909
I'll handle this.

39:25.469 --> 39:29.634
Ah! There you are. I was worried
about you. Where is the other one?

39:29.869 --> 39:35.492
He's... gettin' ready to go home.

39:35.349 --> 39:39.097
Yes, all for the best.
I hope, in time, you will forgive me.

39:41.907 --> 39:45.692
- You were just tryin' to survive.
- Yes! And we will!

39:45.628 --> 39:47.952
All will be well, you will see!

39:49.347 --> 39:51.422
Harlan...

39:52.067 --> 39:54.853
people are not supposed to live for ever.

39:54.826 --> 39:58.693
Maybe not. But if you try
just a few hundred years,

39:58.626 --> 40:01.248
perhaps you might
change your mind, yes?

40:16.545 --> 40:20.708
So... don't forget
to bury the gate when we're gone.

40:20.623 --> 40:23.458
Like that's something I'd forget.

40:26.663 --> 40:28.820
Well.

40:31.382 --> 40:33.458
See you.

40:34.541 --> 40:37.791
And, uh...
you should have that looked at. It's...

40:39.061 --> 40:41.137
Whoo.

40:43.661 --> 40:46.447
Have a good life.

40:48.900 --> 40:51.521
See you.
