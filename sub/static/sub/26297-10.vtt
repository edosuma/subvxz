WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.104
ADULT ADAM:
Ah, the holidays.

00:03.171 --> 00:05.573
A time for families
to come together
and celebrate the season.

00:05.639 --> 00:08.008
For some, it was about
finding the perfect tree.

00:08.076 --> 00:09.843
For others,
it was about the presents

00:09.910 --> 00:11.545
you'd unwrap
on Christmas morning.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.282
But for me,
it was about the movies.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.649
One for A Christmas Story,
please.

00:15.716 --> 00:16.850
One for Scrooged,
please.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.252
One for Christmas Vacation,
please.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.920
One for Ernest Saves
Christmas, please.

00:19.987 --> 00:21.389
Sorry, it's sold out.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.523
Damn it, no!

00:22.590 --> 00:24.192
I know
Ernest saves Christmas,
but how?

00:24.258 --> 00:26.260
It's one of
life's big questions.
Next!

00:26.327 --> 00:27.461
Bro, help me out here.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.863
I'm jonesing for a warm,
fuzzy holiday flick.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.099
Anything else
fit the bill?

00:31.165 --> 00:32.766
I don't know, man.
That one?

00:32.833 --> 00:35.803
ADULT ADAM:
That day, I discovered
the holiday's greatest hero...

00:35.869 --> 00:37.271
John McClane.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.439
Die Hard?

00:38.506 --> 00:40.441
How is that
a holiday movie?

00:40.508 --> 00:41.575
It takes place
at Christmas?

00:41.642 --> 00:43.043
Eh,
I'll give it a shot.

00:43.111 --> 00:45.579
Do you really think
you have a chance against us,
Mr. Cowboy?

00:45.646 --> 00:47.748
Yippee ki yay, .

00:49.483 --> 00:52.720
Best. Christmas. Movie.
Ever!

00:52.786 --> 00:55.589
ADULT ADAM:
I ended up seeing Die Hard
six times in the theater.

00:55.656 --> 00:58.058
And then, like any
movie-obsessed geek
in the '80s,

00:58.126 --> 01:00.994
I patiently waited for it
to premiere on network TV.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.231
Guys, here it comes,
the greatest line
in anything ever.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.833
Do you really think
you have a chance against us,
Mr. Cowboy?

01:05.899 --> 01:07.601
Yippee ki yay,
melon farmer.

01:07.668 --> 01:11.004
ADULT ADAM: Sadly, network TV
meant dubbing over
all the swear words.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.106
"Melon farmer"?

01:12.173 --> 01:13.441
What the hell's
a melon farmer?

01:13.507 --> 01:15.109
Someone
who farms melons.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.845
You think
someone's sole profession
is farming melons?

01:17.911 --> 01:19.113
Only melons?

01:19.180 --> 01:20.314
Forget the melon farming!

01:20.381 --> 01:21.549
They changed it for TV.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.452
Al, listen to me.
Nobody farms just melons.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.787
Melons and grapes, maybe.
But not just melons.

01:26.854 --> 01:27.955
That's ridiculous.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.457
Well, what do you know
from melons?

01:29.523 --> 01:30.791
Oh, I know melons.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.826
I got a beautiful cantaloupe
cut up in the fridge.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.129
Cantaloupe?
Of all the melons,

01:35.196 --> 01:36.697
that's the one
you go with?

01:36.764 --> 01:38.031
You got
a better melon?

01:38.098 --> 01:39.700
Honeydew.
Honeydew?

01:39.767 --> 01:41.202
That's madness.

01:41.269 --> 01:45.038
Hey, Bevy, bring your father
a forkful of that cantaloupe.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.707
Somebody call for
a forkful of cantaloupe?

01:46.774 --> 01:48.842
I'm getting sick and tired
of the melon talk.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.711
Eat the forkful, Al.
You'll see what I mean.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.713
Oh, that is good.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.649
Enough with the melons.
Just watch the movie.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.319
Admit it. Admit I was right
about the cantaloupe.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.488
Well, I came to the dance
with Honeydew,

02:00.554 --> 02:02.856
but it looks like
I'm going home
with Cantaloupe.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.192
Forget the melon!

02:04.258 --> 02:05.926
Nothing like
a nice cantaloupe,
am I right?

02:05.993 --> 02:07.361
That's a nice melon.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.363
I am so proud
of that melon.
It's a nice melon.

02:09.430 --> 02:12.400
Gah!
You stupid melon farmers
are ruining this movie!

02:12.466 --> 02:14.535
Mmm, that is so yummy.

02:14.602 --> 02:15.736
Hey, pass me
some of that cantaloupe.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.972
* I'm twisted up inside

02:19.039 --> 02:22.210
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

02:25.045 --> 02:26.514
* I don't know the future

02:26.580 --> 02:30.251
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:30.318 --> 02:32.186
ADULT ADAM:
It was December
1980-something,

02:32.253 --> 02:34.988
and like always,
my mom was prepping
for the holidays.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.358
Feliz Navidad, suckers!

02:37.425 --> 02:39.327
What the heck is on
your delicious little body?

02:39.393 --> 02:40.494
What does
it look like?

02:40.561 --> 02:41.929
Now that
I'm engaged to Lainey,

02:41.995 --> 02:43.597
I get to be
a Christmas fella.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.899
Oh, lucky!
Such a magical season.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.735
Well, you know
what's really magical?

02:47.801 --> 02:50.704
Hanukkah candles
and spinning tops

02:50.771 --> 02:52.873
and endless bowls...

02:52.940 --> 02:54.408
Of sour cream.

02:54.475 --> 02:55.576
Sour cream sucks.

02:55.643 --> 02:56.944
Boo.
That made me sadder.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.179
Well, as long as you live
under my Santa-less roof,

02:59.247 --> 03:01.715
you are a Hanukkah boy
and always will be.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.351
No! My whole life,

03:03.417 --> 03:06.119
I've lived in the only
dark, undecorated house
on the block.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.421
Now, thanks to Lainey,

03:07.488 --> 03:09.723
I get to soak in
how the Christmas half lives.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.925
I don't care if you marry
the Pope's sister.

03:11.992 --> 03:15.263
The only thing you're gonna be
soaking in is this.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.433
(I HAVE A LITTLE DREIDEL
PLAYS)

03:19.500 --> 03:21.769
(WE WISH YOU
A MERRY CHRISTMAS PLAYS)

03:21.835 --> 03:24.305
(BOTH SONGS PLAY
SIMULTANEOUSLY)

03:27.508 --> 03:29.443
Oh, man! They're having
a holiday sweater-off.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.078
Calm down, Geoff.

03:31.144 --> 03:32.713
This may be
the least important thing
that's ever happened.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.549
Hey! Ow! Ow!

03:35.616 --> 03:37.385
No!

03:37.451 --> 03:38.919
ADULT ADAM: Yep, it looked
like my brother's
Christmas wishes

03:38.986 --> 03:40.153
would be granted,

03:40.220 --> 03:41.255
or so he thought.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.391
Holy crap.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.958
This place
looks so sad.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.427
What am I looking at
right now?

03:46.494 --> 03:48.562
Just Boggle night.
C-A-T, cat.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.097
Way to go, Billy boy!
Damn it.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.299
I'm confused.

03:51.365 --> 03:54.167
Where's the tree
and lights and presents

03:54.234 --> 03:55.836
and three
ZZ Top-looking dudes

03:55.903 --> 03:57.671
handing out
Frankenstein and Myrth?

03:57.738 --> 04:00.107
Yeah, in our family,
we don't really do any of
the yuletide festivities.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.842
Or mention the word.
You mean "Christmas"?

04:01.909 --> 04:03.844
Shh!
Don't say the "C" word.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.012
Why can't I say
"Christmas"?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.314
Oh, God. Christmas.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.449
Damn you, Pookie!
You broke my heart.

04:08.516 --> 04:09.850
Hello, remember?

04:09.917 --> 04:11.952
Christmas Eve is the night
my mom skipped out on us.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.154
Ever since that night,
we don't do anything
for the holiday.

04:14.221 --> 04:16.357
Not even putting presents
in the chimney

04:16.424 --> 04:17.991
or leaving cookies
in your bed

04:18.058 --> 04:20.060
for Santa and his wife,
Christmas Carol?

04:20.127 --> 04:22.129
Wow, you really know nothing
about Christmas.

04:22.195 --> 04:23.497
Obviously!

04:23.564 --> 04:25.799
This was finally my chance
to eat gingerbread people

04:25.866 --> 04:27.335
and make out
under the kissy leaf.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.002
We may not have
gingerbread,

04:29.069 --> 04:31.138
but we got beanies and weenies
on the stove.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.540
Sit tight.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.308
You're eating beans
for Christmas?
And weenies?

04:34.375 --> 04:35.509
This sucks!

04:35.576 --> 04:37.277
Why do I have to marry
into the one family

04:37.345 --> 04:38.679
that refuses
to do Christmas?

04:38.746 --> 04:40.213
Yeah, I'm sorry
my mom abandoned me,

04:40.280 --> 04:42.550
causing a lifetime of turmoil
for my dad and I

04:42.616 --> 04:44.618
and slightly inconveniencing
your holiday plans.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.887
In time, I feel like
it'll get easier for me.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.222
Ugh, bad news.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.560
Had a case of the sads
last night
and ate all the weenies.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.194
But we got beans galore!

04:54.261 --> 04:55.829
Merry Boggle Night, Bar.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.064
**

04:57.130 --> 04:58.231
Merry Boggle Night.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.933
All the spoons are dirty.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.769
ADULT ADAM:
While Barry was "boggled"
by Lainey's Christmas,

05:01.835 --> 05:05.005
at our house,
the holidays always brought
a special visitor.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.675
Uncle Marvin!
Sweet ride.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.210
It's called a Mi-ya-ta!

05:10.277 --> 05:12.680
It's what
the Hollywood Reporter calls

05:12.746 --> 05:14.314
"safe for its size."

05:14.382 --> 05:16.550
Since when do you read
the Hollywood Reporter?

05:16.617 --> 05:19.887
Ever since your uncle
became a big TV star.
What?

05:19.953 --> 05:21.154
Let's just say
that recently

05:21.221 --> 05:23.323
I looked directly down
the barrel of a camera,

05:23.391 --> 05:25.926
and now the world wants more
of Mordechai Fishman.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.661
Who?
That's my stage name.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.229
Why?
Most actors,

05:29.296 --> 05:31.231
they want
to change their name
to something less ethnic.

05:31.298 --> 05:33.266
But when they zig, I zag!

05:33.333 --> 05:35.403
That's genius, Morty!
So, what's the show?

05:35.469 --> 05:36.904
Oh, it's only
the biggest hit on TV.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.005
Mr. Belvedere?

05:38.071 --> 05:39.507
Bigger and better.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.175
Better than Belvedere?
That's not possible.

05:42.242 --> 05:43.711
It's a gritty
new police show.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.345
And when it airs,
oh-ho-ho,

05:45.413 --> 05:48.081
I am going to be
a major player
in the industry.

05:48.148 --> 05:51.218
Dude, my dream
is to be a major player
in the industry!

05:51.284 --> 05:54.054
Then why don't we two
major players in the industry

05:54.121 --> 05:55.556
cook up
a project together?

05:55.623 --> 05:57.525
Yeah. Now that you're
a real working actor,

05:57.591 --> 06:00.060
let's join forces
and pitch our
own Die Hard!

06:00.127 --> 06:01.294
You mean
the action movie?

06:01.361 --> 06:03.130
Wait a minute.
That's already been done.
Exactly.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.198
It's a huge hit,
which means
Hollywood's gonna buy

06:05.265 --> 06:07.401
a ton of shoddy,
poorly-written carbon copies.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.702
I can write poorly.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.337
This is perfect for us!

06:10.404 --> 06:13.306
Hey, Dad,
Uncle Marvin's gonna parlay
his new TV connections

06:13.373 --> 06:14.942
into a huge sale for us.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.910
Hey, that's fantastic!

06:16.977 --> 06:18.712
Okay, if that's sarcasm,

06:18.779 --> 06:21.114
then I got something for you
to look at right here, mister.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.282
Good for you!

06:22.349 --> 06:23.484
Look at it!

06:23.551 --> 06:24.985
It's a Hollywood contract,

06:25.052 --> 06:26.720
and it's from
the Fox Broadcasting Company,

06:26.787 --> 06:27.921
which proves
that it's real.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.322
That's fantastic!

06:29.389 --> 06:31.124
What is happening?
Why are you believing in me?

06:31.191 --> 06:32.493
'Cause that's what I do.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.961
No, you don't.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.396
Every holiday, you accuse me
of being a liar and a con-man,

06:36.464 --> 06:38.231
and then you literally say,
"I don't believe in you".

06:38.298 --> 06:41.435
This year, I've decided
to just kick back
and enjoy the holidays,

06:41.502 --> 06:42.603
so have at it!

06:42.670 --> 06:44.271
Mur-man's on board.
Whoo-hoo!

06:44.337 --> 06:46.474
ADULT ADAM: As we ran off
to take Hollywood by storm,

06:46.540 --> 06:50.143
my mom was brewing up a plan
to keep her Hanukkah boy
at home.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.012
Seasons greetings,
handsome.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.081
Whoa.
What is all this?

06:54.147 --> 06:55.348
Oh, just a typical
Hanukkah.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.017
Maybe you call
Bill and Lainey,

06:57.084 --> 06:59.620
and invite them over for
a casual Ha-nook.

06:59.687 --> 07:00.854
Okay, what's going on?

07:00.921 --> 07:02.523
Mom's doing that thing
where she turns the holidays

07:02.590 --> 07:04.625
into a terrible competition
where no one wins.

07:04.692 --> 07:09.196
If that was true,
then why is my nickname
Easy Breezy Holiday Bevy?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.664
It's not.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.633
You got in a battle
over Christmas
with the Kremps,

07:12.700 --> 07:13.934
Thanksgiving
with Bill Lewis...

07:14.001 --> 07:15.302
Hanukkah
with my parents.

07:15.368 --> 07:16.770
Fourth of July
with the Karps,

07:16.837 --> 07:18.639
Presidents' Day
with that car dealership...

07:18.706 --> 07:22.109
For your information,
stealing a celebration
out of another family's arms

07:22.175 --> 07:24.044
is just the way
I show my holiday spirit.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.146
Well, there's no need
to compete with Bill.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.148
Why? 'Cause nothing
can compete with Christmas?

07:28.215 --> 07:29.683
No, no,
you don't understand.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.018
Oh,
I understand but good.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.286
I don't care how many presents
were under that tree

07:33.353 --> 07:34.788
or how many hams
were glazed...

07:34.855 --> 07:36.690
I will do
whatever I have to do

07:36.757 --> 07:39.392
to keep my babies
home with me
for the holidays.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.861
**

07:40.928 --> 07:42.863
ADULT ADAM:
In that moment,
Barry realized

07:42.930 --> 07:47.835
that he could use
our mom's holiday desperation
to his advantage.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.503
I don't know
if you can compete, Mom.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.505
I mean,
their Christmas was big.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.173
Oh, Mama can go big.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.043
But they had a 20-foot tree,
tons of tinsel,

07:56.109 --> 07:58.879
vats of bread pudding,
life-sized Nutcracker men,

07:58.946 --> 08:01.815
candy cane swords,
an eggnog ice luge,

08:01.882 --> 08:02.916
gum drop pillows,

08:02.983 --> 08:04.585
a working toy shop
with elves,

08:04.652 --> 08:07.154
and an appearance
by the man himself.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.522
Santa?
Not now, Geoffrey!

08:08.589 --> 08:09.923
Yes, Santa.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.059
With all his 47 reindeer.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.260
It was legendary.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.428
Oh, you want legendary?

08:15.495 --> 08:18.098
Erica, Geoff,
get your butts
to the Baderwood market.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.567
I'm gonna need
12 pounds of potatoes

08:19.633 --> 08:21.501
and all the sour cream
you can fit in the car.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.236
Nah.
Yes, ma'am!

08:23.303 --> 08:25.939
I don't know, Mom.
Hanukkah lasts eight nights.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.507
There's no way
you can sustain

08:27.575 --> 08:29.242
that kind of awesomeness
for that long.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.711
Well, buckle up, Schmoo.

08:30.778 --> 08:33.013
The festival of lights
is about to get nasty.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.282
Dude,
what was all that about?

08:35.348 --> 08:36.750
Lainey and Bill
don't even do Christmas.

08:36.817 --> 08:39.720
I know! They eat
beans from a can
like drifters.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.088
Then why'd you get Mom
all riled up?

08:41.154 --> 08:43.223
Think about it.
Hanukkah is
one lame holiday

08:43.290 --> 08:44.925
that drags on
for a whole week.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.127
But imagine if each night
was better than the last.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.262
Oh, my God.
Did you trick
Mom into making

08:49.329 --> 08:51.131
every night of Hanukkah
Christmas morning?

08:51.198 --> 08:53.133
If you put it that way,
it sounds really messed up.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.534
To be clear,
I think it's awesome.

08:54.602 --> 08:55.936
I just wanted to make sure
I knew the plan.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.237
Later, turd.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.773
All right, I am
freshly showered,

08:59.840 --> 09:01.809
and I am ready
to brainstorm.
Go!

09:01.875 --> 09:03.977
Okay, everyone knows
the best part of Die Hard

09:04.044 --> 09:07.114
is that the whole movie
is set in a building, right?

09:07.180 --> 09:10.751
So, I've been thinking
of a ton of locations
to die hard in.

09:10.818 --> 09:13.086
Mmm, I love how
you're thinking inside
of the box here, kid.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.956
What do you got?
Die Hard in a mall.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.558
It's too easy. Next.
Die Hard
in a water park!

09:18.626 --> 09:21.294
It's too wet. Next.
Die Hard
on a moon base.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.997
Boring. Next.
Die Hard in an airport.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.398
Lame. Next.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.067
Die Hard on a bus!

09:27.134 --> 09:28.501
That's the stupidest idea
I've ever heard.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.538
All I got left is
Die Hard in a tree house.

09:31.605 --> 09:35.508
Die Hard
in a tree house?

09:35.575 --> 09:37.144
I don't like it.
You love it?

09:37.210 --> 09:39.446
Oh, man, you ruined
the moment by saying
what I was gonna say.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.649
It just seemed
kinda obvious.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.818
Hey, Mur, if you need us,
we're gonna be
in the basement

09:44.885 --> 09:46.119
working on
our movie pitch.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.287
That sounds fun.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.588
We're gonna shoot
a sizzle reel.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.991
It's a sales tool to help
sell our movie to Hollywood.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.760
Great idea!

09:52.826 --> 09:56.029
Marvin gave me his word
our movie will be seen
up on the big screen.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.398
There ya go.
I have my hopes up
so much!

09:58.465 --> 10:00.000
Absolutely!

10:00.067 --> 10:01.501
POPS: Murray!

10:01.568 --> 10:03.804
Did you hear
that cockamamie scheme?

10:03.871 --> 10:05.438
You gotta shut it down.

10:05.505 --> 10:08.676
Not anymore. I'm done
shutting it down.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.110
But what about Adam?

10:10.177 --> 10:13.046
When Marvin
doesn't come through,
the boy will be crushed.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.315
Yeah.
You got to stop 'em.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.449
Look, it's the holidays.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.618
There's so much
feel-good TV on.

10:18.686 --> 10:21.188
I'll find something fun
and enjoy it.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.323
* Bad boys, bad boys*

10:23.390 --> 10:27.695
ADULT ADAM: Yep, to my dad,
the bad boys of COPS
brought pure holiday joy.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.496
DISPATCH: 83-62.

10:29.562 --> 10:30.898
Got a 10-45,

10:30.964 --> 10:32.966
white male wearing
a striped robe in the ally.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.503
Bring me up to speed,
Andrew.

10:36.569 --> 10:37.905
I'll handle this, Andy.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.373
My crooked landlord
locked me out,

10:40.440 --> 10:41.675
and if he doesn't give me
my keys back,

10:41.742 --> 10:43.210
I am going to take
his Miata!

10:43.276 --> 10:45.078
Murray,
that's your brother!

10:45.145 --> 10:47.647
He's on COPS.
I can see he's on COPS.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.616
Also, there's a...
ANDREW: Hey!

10:49.683 --> 10:51.384
You'll never catch me,
bacon!

10:51.451 --> 10:53.553
I do not consent
to search!

10:53.620 --> 10:55.689
I do not consent
to search!

11:01.729 --> 11:04.431
Get behind!
Aah!

11:04.497 --> 11:06.266
Wait a minute.
I want your badge numbers!

11:06.333 --> 11:08.235
Hey, what's with
the camera crew?

11:08.301 --> 11:09.502
I'm on TV?

11:09.569 --> 11:11.104
POPS:
Marvin's on COPS, Murray.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.539
You gotta shut it down!

11:12.605 --> 11:14.507
I gotta shut it down!
He's on COPS.

11:14.574 --> 11:17.577
ADULT ADAM: And with that,
my dad knew
his vacation was over.

11:17.644 --> 11:20.613
Marvin's on COPS.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.582
ADULT ADAM: Me and my uncle
were ready to hit it big

11:22.649 --> 11:24.617
with Die Hard
in a tree house...

11:24.684 --> 11:27.687
Which meant ripping off
actual Die Hard.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.556
We could totally
do that.
For sure.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.524
Aah!

11:31.591 --> 11:32.893
ADULT ADAM: But jumping off
a tree house was harder
than it looked.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.762
Sorry about your
tree house, man.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.397
Dude, don't be sorry.
I got it all on camera.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.266
Really?

11:39.332 --> 11:42.302
Even the part when I was
dangling from the hose,
and then I split my pants,

11:42.369 --> 11:44.537
and then the tree house
buckled under my weight,

11:44.604 --> 11:46.473
and I fell
and I hit my head?
All of it!

11:46.539 --> 11:49.476
Hey, your mom's only got
the Hanukkah train
for another hour.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.944
So, go get a ride
while you can.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.412
I want to talk
to your uncle.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.281
All right!
The Mur-Man wants
a piece of the action.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.415
Clear the set, kid.

11:55.482 --> 11:56.616
Let the money guys talk.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.051
So, you wanna invest?

11:58.118 --> 12:00.053
You were on COPS.
It aired?

12:00.120 --> 12:02.155
They said
they were gonna tell me!
How did I look?

12:02.222 --> 12:04.758
Like a criminal
because, you know, COPS!

12:04.825 --> 12:06.794
Well, an opportunity
is what you make of it.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.728
You really think COPS
is your big opportunity?

12:08.796 --> 12:10.563
The producers said
that I should call them

12:10.630 --> 12:12.165
any time that
I have an argument
with the police.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.667
That is a Hollywood
connection, Mur.
No!

12:14.734 --> 12:17.470
You're an adult, Marvin.
Why is it always
the same with you?

12:17.537 --> 12:18.939
'Cause I am
always the same!

12:19.006 --> 12:21.574
Every holiday,
I say next year
I'm gonna be better,

12:21.641 --> 12:22.976
but it never changes.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.445
Then it's time to start.
You shut it down.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.915
Do the right thing
and tell Adam the truth.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.049
You're right.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.350
It's time that I stop
depending on you

12:30.417 --> 12:32.585
and take some real
responsibility in my life.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.755
* Whatcha gonna do

12:35.823 --> 12:37.590
* Whatcha gonna do
when they come for you? *

12:37.657 --> 12:39.026
Probably should have
shut it down.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.660
ADULT ADAM: While Marvin
ditched our partnership,

12:40.727 --> 12:42.830
my mom was
luring in the Lewises

12:42.896 --> 12:44.865
with an epic
Night One of Hanukkah,

12:44.932 --> 12:46.900
which included
a Hanukkah tiki hut,

12:46.967 --> 12:49.469
Hanukkah chocolate fountain,
and Hanukkah
champagne tower.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.938
Hot damn.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.440
My accountant friend said
this is a minor holiday.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.442
Guess he was just
yankin' my chain.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.610
Oh, it's nothing.
Honestly, I forgot
it was Hanukkah

12:57.677 --> 12:58.946
till about an hour ago.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.447
Life-changing gift,
anyone?

13:00.513 --> 13:02.515
A '65 Fender
twin reverb amp?

13:02.582 --> 13:04.784
A pitching wedge
with my name on it?

13:04.852 --> 13:07.520
And I got a sensible
leather attache case!
Thanks, Mrs. G.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.457
What can I say?
It's just an average night
of Hanukkah

13:10.523 --> 13:11.691
here at the Goldbergs'.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.026
And it only gets better
from here, Bill!

13:13.093 --> 13:15.028
It gets better?
Infinitely.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.897
It's God's number-one rule.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.199
Every night must be
more awesome than the last.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.667
Uh, right.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.569
If you'll excuse me,
I just need to get
to the mall,

13:22.635 --> 13:25.839
supermarket, bakery, butcher,
and bank before they close.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.876
Hoo-wee!
I cannot wait
for Night Two.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.343
**

13:30.410 --> 13:31.611
Happy Night Two.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.413
ADULT ADAM: Which added
Hanukkah popcorn,

13:33.480 --> 13:35.015
a full
Hanukkah dessert bar,

13:35.082 --> 13:37.017
and Hanukkah
cotton candy?

13:37.084 --> 13:39.486
Hot Hebrew ham,
nothing can beat this.

13:39.552 --> 13:40.954
Nothing except
Night Three.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.356
**

13:43.423 --> 13:44.757
Happy Night Three.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.927
ADULT ADAM: Which now had
Hanukkah snow cones,

13:46.994 --> 13:48.361
Hanukkah pizza buffet,

13:48.428 --> 13:50.597
and I guess
a Hanukkah casino?

13:50.663 --> 13:54.201
Sweet chocolate money,
now this is
the night of all nights.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.603
Sounds like a man
who hasn't seen Night Four.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.106
**

13:59.172 --> 14:00.340
Happy Night Four.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.142
Look, I'm the rich kid
from Silver Spoons!

14:02.209 --> 14:03.843
I don't care
what happens tomorrow night,

14:03.911 --> 14:05.545
there's no way
to top this.

14:05.612 --> 14:08.348
You might think that,
but we're only
halfway through.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.617
I'm just gonna close my eyes
for a minute,
but don't worry.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.585
I can still serve.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.888
My family's Hanukkah sucks.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.257
ADULT ADAM: That night,
my mom burned out on Hanukkah,

14:17.324 --> 14:19.792
and the next day,
I was about to be burned
by my uncle.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.694
Hey, Dad,
have you seen Uncle Marv?

14:21.761 --> 14:23.563
The trailer for Die Hard 2
comes out today.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.632
We were gonna pay
to see Ishtar and then bail.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.601
Yeah, thing is,
he's not gonna call you back.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.803
Uncle Marvin knows
how important this is to me.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.406
He promised
to get our movie idea
onto the big screen.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.707
You'll see.

14:34.774 --> 14:35.909
But say it doesn't happen.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.978
You'll...
You'll still be fine, right?

14:38.045 --> 14:39.746
In that purely
hypothetical situation,

14:39.812 --> 14:41.148
no,
I'll be utterly destroyed.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.415
How about...

14:42.482 --> 14:43.783
I'll take you.
Perfect!

14:43.850 --> 14:45.085
Uncle Marvin
can meet us there.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.420
You can munch on popcorn
and your words.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.822
Popcorn?
That's how they get you.
We'll make our own.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.324
There's no time
to make popcorn.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.060
Well, fine.
I got a refrigerator
full of cantaloupe.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.361
We'll bring that.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.429
You can't bring cantaloupe
into a movie theater!

14:56.496 --> 14:58.932
Of course you can.
Cantaloupe's
the popcorn of fruit.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.301
You can't sit in a theater
and eat a plate of cantaloupe!

15:01.368 --> 15:02.902
Who said anything
about plates?

15:02.970 --> 15:05.605
We're gonna bring a knife
and cut it up nicely
in our laps.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.008
So, now we're cutting
a giant, juicy melon
in the dark?

15:08.075 --> 15:09.476
It's a two-minute trailer!

15:09.542 --> 15:12.512
Fine, princess!
We'll take
the melon baller.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.147
Gives you
two different size balls.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.282
Don't bring the melon.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.350
Uncle Marvin'll
buy me the popcorn.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.651
I'm gonna bring the melon.

15:18.718 --> 15:19.953
**

15:20.020 --> 15:22.522
Kudos.
You've made it through
the festive gauntlet

15:22.589 --> 15:23.957
of the first seven nights.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.492
Your reward?
Night Eight.

15:25.558 --> 15:26.793
I can't wait
for it to begin,

15:26.859 --> 15:28.895
but I don't want it
to end.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.964
I haven't felt this alive
in years!

15:31.031 --> 15:34.867
Hey, look,
it's... Chinese food
and hard candies?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.836
Where's the seven-course,
potato-based feast

15:36.903 --> 15:38.371
and some kind of
motorized dune buggy?

15:38.438 --> 15:39.839
BEVERLY: Oh, so tired.

15:39.906 --> 15:42.842
I'm sorry, Squishy.
Hanukkah broke Mama.

15:42.909 --> 15:45.045
What's going on here?
BARRY: Nothing.

15:45.112 --> 15:47.814
Let's just
go back to your house
for beans and sad Boggle.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.516
Bill, I give up.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.818
Take my boy
and do Christmas.

15:51.884 --> 15:52.919
I don't wanna do
Christmas.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.654
Oh, you have to do
Christmas.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.090
You can't force
Christmas on me,
you monster!

15:57.157 --> 15:58.325
Wait, did you not
tell your mom

15:58.391 --> 16:00.027
we don't
celebrate Christmas?
What?

16:00.093 --> 16:02.795
Funny story
that I'll relay to you all
privately and separately.

16:02.862 --> 16:05.098
So this whole thing
is not normal Hanukkah?

16:05.165 --> 16:06.733
No!

16:06.799 --> 16:09.836
By the eighth night,
I'm giving away socks
and dental floss

16:09.902 --> 16:13.240
and whatever loose mints
I can pick out of my purse.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.874
So, this was just a lie
from Beverly

16:14.941 --> 16:16.376
spurred on
by a lie from Barry?

16:16.443 --> 16:17.844
Kinda.
It's not great.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.646
The only thing
I wanted for the holidays

16:19.712 --> 16:21.681
was to be
part of a family again.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.650
I didn't need gifts
or some big party.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.886
I thought you guys
felt the same way.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.588
**

16:31.391 --> 16:33.526
ADULT ADAM:
After ruining the holidays
for the Lewises,

16:33.593 --> 16:35.728
my mom and Barry
had to come together

16:35.795 --> 16:37.597
to pull off
a Christmas miracle.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.199
Children, I've gathered you
here tonight

16:39.266 --> 16:41.168
because of
a true holiday disaster.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.969
We need to throw
a last-minute Christmas

16:43.036 --> 16:44.537
for people
who hate Christmas

16:44.604 --> 16:45.672
'cause we ruined Hanukkah
for them

16:45.738 --> 16:47.840
after a series
of lies and deceit.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.443
Okay, he's exaggerating,
but yeah, 100% yes.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.212
Wait, are you saying
we get to save Christmas?

16:52.279 --> 16:53.946
I've always wanted
to save Christmas.
Calm down, Geoff.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.748
We haven't heard
how dumb this is.

16:55.815 --> 16:59.919
Okay, I've been listening to
the Christmas radio station
nonstop for five minutes,

16:59.986 --> 17:01.221
and I know exactly

17:01.288 --> 17:02.989
what we need to give
Bill and Lainey.
Really?

17:03.056 --> 17:05.258
It's all right there
in the The Twelve Days
of Christmas song.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.394
Erica, Geoffrey,
write this down.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.695
On it!
No.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.963
First up,
we need a Partridge Family CD.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.765
I think you mean
partridge in a pear...
Buh-bup!

17:12.832 --> 17:15.368
We also need
12 Willis Drummonds,

17:15.435 --> 17:18.105
11 Roddy Pipers,
10 Laineys dancing...

17:18.171 --> 17:19.672
It's "ladies dancing."

17:19.739 --> 17:22.575
Why would Lainey's name
be in a song
from 200 years ago?

17:22.642 --> 17:24.077
That's where this
breaks down for you, Mom?

17:24.144 --> 17:26.813
We also need
nine Cloris Leachmans,
eight maids a-sweeping,

17:26.879 --> 17:29.416
seven Sprites for swigging,
six 6-piece nuggets,

17:29.482 --> 17:31.218
fi-i-i-ve onion rings,

17:31.284 --> 17:33.253
four Larry Birds,
three french fries,

17:33.320 --> 17:36.156
two leather gloves,
and, of course,
a Partridge Family CD.

17:36.223 --> 17:39.292
I'll get the fries, nuggets,
Sprite, and Larry Bird,
I guess!

17:39.359 --> 17:41.461
You focus on the rest.
Move!

17:41.528 --> 17:42.895
Okay,
it's up to you and me.

17:42.962 --> 17:44.464
Oh,
you'll actually help me?

17:44.531 --> 17:47.300
Normally, never,
but you royally screwed
this up for Bill and Lainey,

17:47.367 --> 17:48.968
so what do you need?

17:49.035 --> 17:51.438
Trees, lights, stockings,
nutcrackers, everything.
Let's move!

17:51.504 --> 17:53.806
You do know it's Christmas Eve
and everything's closed.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.509
True.
But the Kremps went skiing,

17:56.576 --> 17:59.679
and I'm supposed to be
taking care of their dog,
Daisy.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.315
So, we're gonna
break into the Kremps',
steal their Christmas,

18:02.382 --> 18:03.650
and then break
into the Lewises'

18:03.716 --> 18:05.285
and give them the Christmas
we just stole?

18:05.352 --> 18:06.419
It's not great.

18:06.486 --> 18:07.520
This whole thing.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.456
It's just,
it's not great.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.224
To be clear, I think it's
awesome. I just wanted to
make sure I knew the plan.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.593
ADULT ADAM:
With that, they were off
to make the holidays right.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.795
And when my uncle
didn't show up
to that theater,

18:15.862 --> 18:18.131
I realized I was wrong
to have trusted him.

18:18.198 --> 18:21.668
Look, your uncle likes to make
a lot of crazy plans,

18:21.734 --> 18:24.003
and usually
I shut him down, but...

18:24.070 --> 18:25.172
Shh! It's starting.

18:27.174 --> 18:30.877
NARRATOR: In this tree house,
high above the backyard,

18:30.943 --> 18:34.714
the last thing
cop Don McShane wants
to be is a hero.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.516
We got hostages
in the tree house.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.352
NARRATOR: But not
everybody gets what
they want for Christmas.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.987
**

18:41.053 --> 18:43.190
Yippee ki yay,
melon farmer.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.859
Oh, my God.
It's my movie.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.462
ADAM: This channel is reserved
for emergency calls only.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.331
Does it sound like
I'm ordering a pizza!?

18:51.398 --> 18:54.033
ADULT ADAM: That day,
I didn't see the trailer
for Die Hard 2.

18:54.100 --> 18:57.470
For the first time ever,
I saw something I wrote
on the big screen,

18:57.537 --> 18:59.406
and my life
changed forever.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.175
And I had one man
to thank for it.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.010
Uncle Marv
totally came through.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.645
He really did.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.480
ADULT ADAM: Turns out,
my dad saw a side
of Uncle Marvin

19:07.547 --> 19:09.182
he'd never seen before,

19:09.249 --> 19:10.917
a side he could trust.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.385
Hey. Marvin, wait up.

19:12.452 --> 19:15.255
It's fine. Don't make
a big thing out of it.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.556
How did you do that?

19:16.623 --> 19:18.858
I realized you were right,
so I came back,

19:18.925 --> 19:20.860
and I bribed the guy
in the projection booth.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.329
Well,
you did a nice thing.

19:22.395 --> 19:25.164
I felt like
I owed it to Adam.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.300
Man, that kid
means the world to me.

19:29.836 --> 19:33.873
Looks like this whole me
not shutting you down thing
worked out okay this year.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.975
You know what?
Maybe it's time for me

19:36.042 --> 19:37.777
to start cleaning up
my own messes.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.813
I think next year,
things are gonna be
different with you.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.882
That's usually my line.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.252
After you tell me
that you don't believe in me.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.754
Yeah, but after the way
you came through this time?

19:47.820 --> 19:49.489
I do believe in you.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.763
ADULT ADAM: Looking back,
that year was filled
with holiday miracles,

19:56.829 --> 19:58.130
and not just for my family.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.332
What's all this?

19:59.399 --> 20:01.934
Little Goldbergs Christmas
for our favorite family.

20:02.001 --> 20:05.104
How did you even
get in here?
Santa has his ways.

20:05.171 --> 20:08.441
Guys, this is beautiful,
but we don't do
this kind of thing.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.042
Well, you do now.

20:10.109 --> 20:13.079
'Cause even though you lost
some family on Christmas,

20:13.145 --> 20:15.582
now you've gained
a whole new one.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.417
**

20:17.484 --> 20:18.618
That sounds nice.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.052
Good.

20:20.119 --> 20:23.155
'Cause now we can make some
new traditions together.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.459
**

20:26.526 --> 20:29.796
ADULT ADAM: Truth is,
every family celebrates
the holidays in their own way.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.799
And while some of those
traditions go back
generations,

20:32.865 --> 20:35.768
the most exciting traditions
are the new ones you form

20:35.835 --> 20:37.804
with the people you love
at your side.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.939
Yippee ki yay,
melon farmer.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.308
ADULT ADAM:
And for me and my family,

20:41.374 --> 20:44.110
our favorite tradition
was sitting together

20:44.176 --> 20:46.913
and watching the greatest
Christmas movie ever.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.948
**

21:00.760 --> 21:02.862
Quick, change the channel.
I'm on TV again.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.365
No way! What show?
It's a hit legal drama.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.666
L.A. Law?

21:06.733 --> 21:08.668
Would you just change
the channel already, man?

21:08.735 --> 21:10.703
ANNOUNCER: What you are
witnessing is real.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.205
The participants
are not actors.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.609
Both parties have agreed
to dismiss their court cases

21:16.676 --> 21:18.545
and have their disputes
settled here...

21:18.611 --> 21:20.146
The People's Court.

21:20.212 --> 21:21.548
Fun fact...

21:21.614 --> 21:24.317
Wapner does not like it
when you bang his gavel.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.385
Huh.

21:25.452 --> 21:26.453
He hates that.
