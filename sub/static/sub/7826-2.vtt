19:55.490 --> 19:56.890
{\an1}Yay!

20:12.370 --> 20:16.410
{\an1}You people out there,
you are the stars!

20:16.480 --> 20:17.110
{\an1}Cool!

20:23.150 --> 20:24.150
{\an1}Hey, look at me!

20:24.220 --> 20:25.950
{\an1}I'm Blanche Dubois.

20:26.020 --> 20:26.890
{\an1}Mom!

20:27.690 --> 20:29.590
{\an1}Way to go, mom.

20:29.660 --> 20:32.190
{\an1}\h\h\h\hEverybody
was cheering for you.

20:32.260 --> 20:33.190
{\an1}Almost everybody.

20:33.260 --> 20:35.030
{\an1}Kids, wait in the car.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.730
{\an1}I want to talk to your mother
about this play thing.

20:37.800 --> 20:41.000
{\an1}( <i>British accent: )
Looking for a spot of fun with
the Missus, eh Gov'nor?</i>

20:41.070 --> 20:41.970
{\an1}Shut up, boy.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.870
{\an1}Marge, you were terrific.

20:43.940 --> 20:45.410
{\an1}Oh, come on, Homer.

20:45.470 --> 20:47.070
{\an1}By the end,
you were so bored

20:47.140 --> 20:49.680
{\an1}you could barely keep
your selfish head up.

20:49.740 --> 20:50.680
{\an1}I wasn't bored.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.690
{\an1}I was sad.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.610
{\an1}It really got to me

20:53.680 --> 20:57.450
{\an1}how that lady, uh, um...
you know which one I mean.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.190
{\an1}<i>You played her.</i>

20:58.250 --> 20:59.190
{\an1}Blanche.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.920
{\an1}Yeah, how Blanche was sad

21:00.990 --> 21:04.630
{\an1}and how that guy, Stanley,
should have been nice to her.

21:04.690 --> 21:06.390
{\an1}Yeah, go on.

21:06.460 --> 21:07.830
{\an1}It made me feel bad.

21:07.900 --> 21:11.140
{\an1}The poor thing ends up
being hauled to the nut house

21:11.200 --> 21:13.730
{\an1}when all she needed
was for that big slob

21:13.800 --> 21:15.570
{\an1}to show her some respect.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.800
{\an1}At least, that's what <i>I thought.</i>

21:17.870 --> 21:20.370
{\an1}But I have a history
of missing the point
of stuff like this.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.780
{\an1}\h\h\h\hNo, Homer,
you got it just right.

21:24.810 --> 21:27.180
{\an1}Hey, you know I'm a lot
\h\h\h\hlike that guy.

21:27.250 --> 21:28.720
{\an1}Really?

21:28.780 --> 21:31.720
{\an1}Yeah, like when I pick my teeth
\h\h\hwith the mail and stuff.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.620
{\an1}Maybe just a little.
