00:05.370 --> 00:07.670
<b>This is a bullet casing.</b>

00:08.580 --> 00:11.910
<b>Nothing mechanical is allowed here, right?</b>

00:12.620 --> 00:15.450
<b>So the underground rulers of NGL</b>

00:16.080 --> 00:19.520
<b>were manufacturing guns in addition to drugs.</b>

00:19.520 --> 00:22.140
<b>But judging by this...</b>

00:22.480 --> 00:24.250
<b>It wasn't done by a human.</b>

00:26.020 --> 00:29.000
<b>Most likely, it was a Chimera Ant.</b>

01:49.000 --> 01:54.050
<b>The x Fight x Begins</b>

02:00.550 --> 02:03.310
<b>The Chimera Ants continue their 
rampage throughout NGL.</b>

02:04.200 --> 02:07.780
<b>And they've finally struck against the don</b>

02:07.780 --> 02:10.210
<b>who ruled this country from the shadows.</b>

02:16.870 --> 02:19.400
<b>It's safe to assume that the Chimera Ants</b>

02:19.400 --> 02:22.190
<b>have assumed control of NGL's interior.</b>

02:23.880 --> 02:27.080
<b>The question is if we can reach their nest</b>

02:27.750 --> 02:30.080
<b>before the Queen births the King.</b>

02:48.840 --> 02:50.080
<b>More!</b>

02:50.820 --> 02:52.080
<b>More!</b>

02:53.160 --> 02:55.310
<b>I need much more.</b>

02:59.270 --> 03:04.500
<b>I need more food of high 
nutritional value for my child.</b>

03:08.190 --> 03:10.020
<b>Over a hundred a day?</b>

03:10.550 --> 03:13.460
<b>Yes, the Queen has requested</b>

03:13.460 --> 03:16.380
<b>more food, to aid the King's growth.</b>

03:16.640 --> 03:20.290
<b>We've been providing fifty a day.</b>

03:20.750 --> 03:22.870
<b>Just when we'd managed</b>

03:22.870 --> 03:26.390
<b>to assemble enough soldiers to ease the job...</b>

03:27.250 --> 03:28.390
<b>If the Queen commands,</b>

03:28.800 --> 03:31.390
<b>we will double or triple our quota.</b>

03:31.390 --> 03:33.980
<b>We should increase our ranks...</b>

03:33.980 --> 03:34.720
<b>No.</b>

03:35.310 --> 03:39.260
<b>Increasing them would be simple, but it 
would disturb the chain of command.</b>

03:39.710 --> 03:43.710
<b>We must start by instilling more discipline.</b>

03:44.660 --> 03:46.640
<b>We'll increase our ranks afterwards.</b>

03:46.940 --> 03:49.720
<b>First, we must eliminate sedition in all—</b>

03:49.720 --> 03:51.140
<b>Don't make me laugh!</b>

03:52.620 --> 03:55.670
<b>That isn't going to be necessary.</b>

03:56.240 --> 04:01.670
<b>The rare human I captured has the 
nutritional value of a thousand normal ones.</b>

04:02.120 --> 04:03.830
<b>One with the value of a thousand?</b>

04:04.160 --> 04:05.430
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

04:05.430 --> 04:06.860
<b>You didn't know?</b>

04:07.360 --> 04:14.040
<b>I'm saying that some unique humans 
are overflowing with life energy.</b>

04:14.750 --> 04:19.110
<b>They're hard to find, which is why they're rare.</b>

04:19.420 --> 04:20.970
<b>Rare?</b>

04:20.970 --> 04:24.970
<b>These special humans each have the 
nutritional value of a thousand normal ones?</b>

04:24.970 --> 04:25.950
<b>That's right.</b>

04:26.300 --> 04:27.120
<b>Impossible!</b>

04:27.120 --> 04:28.210
<b>No such human could—</b>

04:28.210 --> 04:29.950
<b>They do exist...</b>

04:30.220 --> 04:33.330
<b>I saw and fought one.</b>

04:33.330 --> 04:37.420
<b>And then, I accidentally took a bite!</b>

04:37.730 --> 04:38.740
<b>Pike!</b>

04:38.740 --> 04:41.800
<b>The one you took a bite out of wasn't rare.</b>

04:42.140 --> 04:43.790
<b>Oh, yeah.</b>

04:43.790 --> 04:45.140
<b>You're right.</b>

04:45.140 --> 04:46.990
<b>Don't spout nonsense!</b>

04:46.990 --> 04:50.310
<b>Your words were also nonsense, Zazan-sama.</b>

04:50.580 --> 04:52.680
<b>I spoke nonsense? When?</b>

04:52.980 --> 04:56.540
<b>You weren't the one who 
captured the rare human.</b>

04:56.540 --> 04:57.440
<b>I did.</b>

04:58.690 --> 05:03.440
<b>Remember how you praised me 
for the wonderful job I did?</b>

05:03.440 --> 05:05.920
<b>I'm the one who disabled him!</b>

05:05.920 --> 05:09.450
<b>But I'm the one who held him in place—</b>

05:12.520 --> 05:14.120
<b>Enough.</b>

05:14.120 --> 05:16.000
<b>Make yourself scarce.</b>

05:17.300 --> 05:19.230
<b>F-For...</b>

05:20.270 --> 05:22.840
<b>Forgive me!</b>

05:26.310 --> 05:29.300
<b>Was that story true?</b>

05:29.550 --> 05:32.330
<b>Wh-Why, if it isn't Bihorn-sama...</b>

05:32.330 --> 05:35.310
<b>Yes, there really was a rare human.</b>

05:35.310 --> 05:36.560
<b>Not that!</b>

05:36.560 --> 05:38.810
<b>Did you really take a bite?</b>

05:38.810 --> 05:43.880
<b>No, I took a bite of the normal 
human, not of the rare—</b>

05:44.910 --> 05:47.620
<b>It doesn't matter if it was rare or not.</b>

05:48.060 --> 05:51.330
<b>Consuming the Queen's food</b>

05:51.330 --> 05:52.530
<b>is not permitted.</b>

05:58.490 --> 06:00.540
<b>I'll never do it again,</b>

06:00.540 --> 06:03.880
<b>so please spare me just this once, Bihorn-sama!</b>

06:03.880 --> 06:06.560
<b>Hold it! Come back here!</b>

06:06.560 --> 06:07.550
<b>Bihorn.</b>

06:08.560 --> 06:11.610
<b>Have you ever seen a rare human?</b>

06:11.980 --> 06:15.280
<b>No, I've only heard about them from Zazan.</b>

06:15.280 --> 06:16.100
<b>Zazan,</b>

06:16.880 --> 06:19.480
<b>could you provide more detail 
about this rare human?</b>

06:19.980 --> 06:21.110
<b>Sure.</b>

06:25.590 --> 06:27.050
<b>Arrows of light...</b>

06:27.050 --> 06:28.200
<b>I understand.</b>

06:29.120 --> 06:32.120
<b>That explains the hole in the skull of that grunt.</b>

06:35.480 --> 06:38.210
<b>Yes, that must be it.</b>

06:38.210 --> 06:40.120
<b>One mystery has been solved.</b>

06:40.470 --> 06:45.030
<b>While the arrows are invisible to foot soldiers,</b>

06:45.030 --> 06:47.560
<b>an officer like Pike can see them.</b>

06:47.560 --> 06:49.130
<b>See them and stop them.</b>

06:49.630 --> 06:52.330
<b>In other words, officers can capture them.</b>

06:52.620 --> 06:55.390
<b>Yes, like I did.</b>

06:56.230 --> 07:00.840
<b>That one was clearly different from 
the other humans we've captured.</b>

07:00.840 --> 07:05.400
<b>Its whole body appeared to 
be shining with life energy.</b>

07:05.400 --> 07:07.090
<b>That's how I knew</b>

07:08.410 --> 07:12.310
<b>that it would have the nutritional 
value of over a thousand humans.</b>

07:12.840 --> 07:15.910
<b>More than ten days' worth in one human?</b>

07:16.370 --> 07:19.410
<b>If that's true, we're saved.</b>

07:19.890 --> 07:22.330
<b>It'd be far easier than carrying</b>

07:22.330 --> 07:25.420
<b>a hundred humans around each day.</b>

07:25.860 --> 07:29.520
<b>If we find one on the first day, 
we can rest the next nine.</b>

07:29.520 --> 07:30.490
<b>Fool!</b>

07:30.490 --> 07:33.410
<b>They're rare because they're hard to find!</b>

07:33.410 --> 07:35.180
<b>What? Again?</b>

07:36.510 --> 07:37.540
<b>Understood.</b>

07:37.540 --> 07:39.090
<b>Is something wrong?</b>

07:39.090 --> 07:43.630
<b>Rammot is acting without my permission again.</b>

08:03.920 --> 08:05.270
<b>Damn!</b>

08:05.270 --> 08:08.960
<b>Why am I stuck eating horses?</b>

08:09.600 --> 08:10.990
<b>Damn...</b>

08:10.990 --> 08:13.660
<b>This is all Colt's fault.</b>

08:19.770 --> 08:21.820
<b>I want to eat humans!</b>

08:27.910 --> 08:30.890
<b><i>First, I have to deal with Rammot.</i></b>

08:30.890 --> 08:32.880
<b><i>Otherwise, it sets a bad example.</i></b>

08:48.380 --> 08:51.240
<b><i>What is this presence?</i></b>

08:52.500 --> 08:53.420
<b><i>Could it be?</i></b>

09:09.180 --> 09:10.540
<b>No one's here.</b>

09:15.070 --> 09:15.880
<b>Say...</b>

09:16.360 --> 09:17.720
<b>Something smells.</b>

09:19.510 --> 09:20.740
<b>Coming from over there.</b>

10:02.720 --> 10:04.310
<b>It's like a morning sacrifice.</b>

10:05.970 --> 10:08.370
<b>A ritual practiced by birds 
called bull-headed shrikes.</b>

10:08.940 --> 10:11.930
<b>They impale their prey on sharp 
objects, such as branches.</b>

10:12.500 --> 10:13.420
<b>Hey!</b>

10:24.700 --> 10:25.230
<b>Wha?</b>

10:25.230 --> 10:27.130
<b>Wh-What is that?</b>

10:28.600 --> 10:31.060
<b><i>They're capable of concealing their presence?</i></b>

11:09.820 --> 11:11.090
<b>Trash.</b>

11:13.230 --> 11:15.400
<b>Those are mine!</b>

11:34.300 --> 11:35.760
<b>Ow!</b>

11:52.880 --> 11:54.550
<b><i>This guy is strong.</i></b>

11:55.370 --> 11:57.590
<b><i>Fighting him won't be easy.</i></b>

12:05.610 --> 12:07.040
<b>Gon... Killua...</b>

12:08.080 --> 12:11.300
<b>You two must deal with him yourselves.</b>

12:19.750 --> 12:22.000
<b>That is a Chimera Ant soldier.</b>

12:22.480 --> 12:26.180
<b>We will encounter many more like him.</b>

12:26.770 --> 12:29.940
<b>I won't be able to help you during combat.</b>

12:30.350 --> 12:32.650
<b>If you can't defeat it, you'll have to leave.</b>

12:35.070 --> 12:36.440
<b>You'll just be in my way.</b>

12:49.780 --> 12:51.530
<b>Weren't you listening, Kite?</b>

12:51.860 --> 12:53.430
<b>We are also pros!</b>

13:05.360 --> 13:07.490
<b>Don't treat us like kids!</b>

13:09.060 --> 13:10.750
<b><i>What trick is this?</i></b>

13:11.110 --> 13:13.570
<b><i>Suddenly, they feel far stronger.</i></b>

13:37.140 --> 13:38.420
<b><i>Time to test it!</i></b>

13:45.970 --> 13:47.470
<b>Thunderbolt</b>

13:46.040 --> 13:47.470
<b><i>Thunderbolt!</i></b>

13:55.210 --> 13:58.270
<b><i>First comes rock...</i></b>

13:59.790 --> 14:00.980
<b><i>Rock...</i></b>

14:01.370 --> 14:02.530
<b><i>Paper...</i></b>

14:03.370 --> 14:05.370
<b><i>Rock!</i></b>

14:08.330 --> 14:10.320
<b>Yes! Just enough!</b>

14:31.290 --> 14:33.020
<b>Bastards!</b>

14:33.020 --> 14:37.050
<b>I'm gonna eat you!</b>

14:38.680 --> 14:42.560
<b>I will! Remember this!</b>

14:47.290 --> 14:48.780
<b><i>Our attacks...</i></b>

14:49.380 --> 14:50.750
<b><i>They didn't work.</i></b>

14:53.420 --> 14:55.410
<b>That guy's smart.</b>

14:55.410 --> 14:59.040
<b>He let his soldier do the fighting, 
so he could learn our abilities.</b>

15:03.720 --> 15:04.810
<b>Are you coming?</b>

15:07.150 --> 15:12.210
<b>There's no need to feel down. 
Your attacks weren't that bad.</b>

15:12.610 --> 15:15.250
<b>You just need experience now.</b>

15:17.070 --> 15:21.030
<b>If you wish to become stronger, 
this is a perfect opportunity.</b>

15:21.030 --> 15:24.660
<b>But if you aren't prepared, you won't 
be able to endure the ordeal.</b>

15:27.050 --> 15:28.450
<b>Whether we win or lose,</b>

15:29.640 --> 15:32.440
<b>hell lies ahead of us.</b>

15:40.730 --> 15:41.740
<b>We're coming.</b>

15:42.500 --> 15:43.290
<b>Yeah.</b>

15:53.320 --> 15:55.020
<b>That hurts...</b>

15:55.590 --> 15:57.850
<b>Damn...</b>

16:00.830 --> 16:03.930
<b>Don't lay a finger on them.</b>

16:07.640 --> 16:09.610
<b>I'm gonna get my revenge.</b>

16:10.870 --> 16:12.490
<b>I'll kill them...</b>

16:13.090 --> 16:15.490
<b>I'll eat them all!</b>

16:18.490 --> 16:20.920
<b>I'm willing to let you kill them.</b>

16:21.530 --> 16:23.500
<b>But you may not eat them.</b>

16:23.950 --> 16:27.500
<b>Bodies brimming with so much life 
energy provide the finest nutrition.</b>

16:28.360 --> 16:30.760
<b>They must be fed to the Queen.</b>

16:31.520 --> 16:34.800
<b>No way! Killing them won't be enough!</b>

16:35.450 --> 16:40.270
<b>I have to tear them to shreds, 
fill my belly with them...</b>

16:41.110 --> 16:45.770
<b>Crap on their skulls, and crush them!</b>

16:46.390 --> 16:47.770
<b>And even still...</b>

16:47.770 --> 16:50.980
<b>That still may not be enough to quell my fury!</b>

16:51.940 --> 16:54.780
<b>I won't be satisfied with just killing them!</b>

16:55.480 --> 16:57.120
<b>Don't get above yourself.</b>

16:58.140 --> 16:59.670
<b>This is an order.</b>

17:00.030 --> 17:02.410
<b>You would defy your leader's command?</b>

17:04.880 --> 17:07.020
<b>It isn't just Yunju's team.</b>

17:07.610 --> 17:10.300
<b>The other teams do it all the time.</b>

17:11.110 --> 17:15.260
<b>Cheetu and Hagya's teams 
do whatever they want.</b>

17:15.750 --> 17:18.550
<b>Their leaders enjoy the hunt!</b>

17:19.820 --> 17:21.340
<b>Is that true?</b>

17:21.340 --> 17:22.310
<b>Yeah!</b>

17:22.960 --> 17:25.300
<b>They chase humans, kill them,</b>

17:25.300 --> 17:27.310
<b>then leave the dead bodies there.</b>

17:28.040 --> 17:33.530
<b>None of the other squadrons just haul 
bodies back like industrious little drones,</b>

17:34.450 --> 17:36.540
<b>my dear leader Colt.</b>

17:37.850 --> 17:42.670
<b>I'll transfer to a different squad if 
that's what it takes to kill them.</b>

17:45.170 --> 17:48.630
<b>Damn, it hurts!</b>

17:50.110 --> 17:51.200
<b>A reason?</b>

17:51.760 --> 17:54.090
<b>Because it's fun, of course.</b>

17:54.680 --> 17:57.780
<b>It's good that humans know how to speak.</b>

17:57.780 --> 18:01.100
<b>That way, we know what 
they think as they die.</b>

18:01.510 --> 18:04.390
<b>I enjoy seeing the fear on their faces.</b>

18:04.390 --> 18:06.390
<b>Yep, it's great!</b>

18:06.390 --> 18:09.500
<b>Once you've tried it, you can never go back.</b>

18:15.820 --> 18:18.110
<b>Do you feel the same way, Cheetu?</b>

18:19.190 --> 18:21.730
<b>You're wrong about one thing...</b>

18:21.730 --> 18:25.620
<b>Hagya's and my teams are meeting our quota.</b>

18:25.890 --> 18:29.270
<b>We use our free time to enjoy the hunt.</b>

18:29.570 --> 18:31.250
<b>However...</b>

18:31.250 --> 18:35.220
<b>You shouldn't waste the Queen's 
precious food for sport.</b>

18:35.220 --> 18:36.390
<b>Precious food?</b>

18:36.390 --> 18:38.130
<b>Don't make me laugh.</b>

18:38.130 --> 18:42.190
<b>There are more of them than she'll ever need.</b>

18:42.190 --> 18:43.720
<b>They're trash!</b>

18:45.120 --> 18:47.860
<b>I'm just taking out the trash.</b>

18:47.860 --> 18:49.240
<b>Got a problem with that?</b>

18:49.760 --> 18:51.050
<b>Not at all!</b>

18:52.960 --> 18:55.650
<b>Do you know about the rare humans?</b>

18:56.130 --> 18:57.540
<b>Rare humans?</b>

18:57.540 --> 18:58.680
<b>Oh...</b>

18:58.680 --> 19:02.280
<b>The ones that are overflowing with life energy?</b>

19:02.640 --> 19:05.160
<b>I haven't seen one yet.</b>

19:05.720 --> 19:10.530
<b>If you do, capture it alive and bring it back.</b>

19:18.780 --> 19:20.460
<b>Fine.</b>

19:20.460 --> 19:22.680
<b>I'll give the rare ones to the Queen.</b>

19:22.980 --> 19:27.080
<b>Let that Rammot guy know, so he calms down.</b>

19:28.290 --> 19:29.690
<b>I'll take that as a promise.</b>

19:37.900 --> 19:40.510
<b>Fool. You think I'd keep that promise?</b>

19:41.800 --> 19:45.770
<b>Let's find a rare one and eat it.</b>

19:45.770 --> 19:46.980
<b>Let's eat!</b>

19:58.000 --> 20:00.330
<b>How's Rammot doing?</b>

20:00.330 --> 20:02.330
<b>Tonight will be critical.</b>

20:02.330 --> 20:05.450
<b>But his anger and stamina 
should see him through it.</b>

20:06.120 --> 20:10.480
<b>Still, our army seems to have 
too much personality.</b>

20:10.840 --> 20:13.720
<b>Having multiple perspectives helps,</b>

20:13.720 --> 20:16.040
<b>but too many are self-centered.</b>

20:16.800 --> 20:20.810
<b>We're meeting our quota, so there's 
nothing to worry about.</b>

20:20.810 --> 20:22.490
<b>You're one to talk.</b>

20:25.440 --> 20:28.900
<b>Are you counting the humans you capture?</b>

20:28.900 --> 20:30.420
<b>Hmm... Kind of.</b>

20:30.790 --> 20:32.500
<b>That doesn't count.</b>

20:34.880 --> 20:38.410
<b>Perhaps we should have everyone 
assemble to discuss this.</b>

20:38.410 --> 20:41.890
<b>No, we operate at different times now.</b>

20:41.890 --> 20:44.260
<b>Assembling everyone is impossible.</b>

20:44.940 --> 20:48.750
<b>I'll talk to each leader and devise a solution.</b>

20:48.750 --> 20:50.250
<b>What about the Queen?</b>

20:51.910 --> 20:54.530
<b>She's busy nourishing the King.</b>

20:55.110 --> 20:56.680
<b>We can't distract her.</b>

20:59.940 --> 21:01.570
<b>I'll handle this.</b>

21:01.920 --> 21:04.590
<b>Sounds tough. 
Don't ruin your health.</b>

21:05.050 --> 21:08.000
<b>If you're honestly concerned, 
try to control yourself.</b>

21:18.290 --> 21:19.990
<b>This is ugly...</b>

21:20.460 --> 21:22.780
<b>The stench alone would guide us to the corpses.</b>

21:23.420 --> 21:24.340
<b>Look at this.</b>

21:27.710 --> 21:31.350
<b>So this is the hidden side of NGL.</b>

21:31.690 --> 21:32.720
<b>I suppose so.</b>

21:33.280 --> 21:34.980
<b>Killua... Kite...</b>

21:44.100 --> 21:48.590
<b>The silence of the drug factory 
overtaken by the Chimera Ants</b>

21:48.590 --> 21:51.200
<b>further intensifies the chill in the air.</b>

21:52.060 --> 21:55.370
<b>What awaits Gon and his friends there?</b>

23:26.160 --> 23:28.400
<b>Next time: Kite x And x Slots.</b>

23:28.400 --> 23:29.940
<b>Start the slots!</b>
