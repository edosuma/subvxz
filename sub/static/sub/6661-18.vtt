WEBVTT

00:06.677 --> 00:09.340
ARE YOU SURE THIS TEST
IS GONNA WORK?

00:09.340 --> 00:10.311
POSITIVE.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.012
SIMON DROPS
THE WASHING MACHINE

00:12.012 --> 00:13.414
AND IF SAM IS ABLE
TO USE HIS EVIL POWER

00:13.414 --> 00:16.047
TO PROTECT HIMSELF,
WE'LL HAVE OUR PROOF.

00:16.047 --> 00:18.119
HE'S THE SON
OF THE DEVIL.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.320
BUT IF HE'S JUST HUMAN,
HE'LL BE CRUSHED.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.253
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SUSPECTS HE'S
SATAN'S SPAWN.

00:22.253 --> 00:25.096
YOU WANT
TO KNOW FOR SURE?

00:26.026 --> 00:27.498
YES, I DO.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.475
AHH.

00:44.475 --> 00:46.777
THERE YOU GO. PROOF.

00:46.777 --> 00:48.079
HE IS EVIL.

00:48.079 --> 00:50.181
HE SEEMED LIKE SUCH
A NICE KID.

00:50.181 --> 00:51.222
SO HELPLESS.

00:51.222 --> 00:51.722
HELPLESS?

00:51.722 --> 00:54.625
TONY, COME ON,
THIS IS THE HEIR TO
THE DEVIL'S DOMAIN.

00:54.625 --> 00:56.257
THE HARBINGER
OF THE APOCALYPSE.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.528
HE WILL RISE TO POWER
IN HIS LIFETIME

00:57.528 --> 01:02.193
AND BRING ABOUT
THE DESTRUCTION OF
HUMAN CIVILIZATION.

01:08.399 --> 01:12.173
OH, HE IS EVIL LIKE NONE
HAVE KNOWN BEFORE.

01:26.457 --> 01:27.318
OOH.

01:27.318 --> 01:29.089
WHATCHA DOING?

01:29.089 --> 01:32.123
WHAT DOES THAT
LOOK LIKE TO YOU?

01:32.123 --> 01:35.095
UNICORN FIGHTING
A WEREWOLF.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.827
IT'S THE
ULTIMATE BATTLE.

01:36.827 --> 01:37.468
WHAT?

01:37.468 --> 01:39.330
DO YOU--DO YOU
SEE A PERSON?

01:39.330 --> 01:41.132
LIKE MAYBE
SOMEBODY WE KNOW?

01:41.132 --> 01:43.134
WHO DO YOU THINK
IT LOOKS LIKE?

01:43.134 --> 01:45.206
I THINK IT LOOKS
LIKE STEVE.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.106
STEVE?

01:46.106 --> 01:47.238
DEAD GAY
DEMON STEVE?

01:47.238 --> 01:48.839
YEAH, DO YOU
SEE IT? LOOK.

01:48.839 --> 01:52.213
STEVE FIGHTING
A UNICORN?

01:52.213 --> 01:54.285
YOU GUYS ARE JERKS!

01:54.285 --> 01:55.186
HEY!
HEY!

01:55.186 --> 01:57.648
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO PICK ME
UP FROM THE JAIL.

01:57.648 --> 01:59.550
OH, THAT WAS TODAY?

01:59.550 --> 02:01.652
COULD HAVE SWORN
THAT WAS TOMORROW.

02:01.652 --> 02:02.853
BENJI,
WE'RE SO SORRY.

02:02.853 --> 02:06.157
AT LEAST THEY
HOOKED YOU UP WITH
THAT WEIRD SUIT.

02:06.157 --> 02:09.760
YEAH, IT WAS A PRESENT FROM
AN ATTEMPTED MURDERER I MET.

02:09.760 --> 02:11.602
THAT'S AN ATTEMPTED
MURDER SUIT?

02:11.602 --> 02:12.763
YES.
NICE.

02:12.763 --> 02:13.834
CAN I TRY ON THE JACKET?

02:13.834 --> 02:14.635
HANDS OFF.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.337
I LET YOU TRY ON MY
HOMELESS GUY PANTS.

02:16.337 --> 02:17.508
COME ON.
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

02:17.508 --> 02:20.841
ALL RIGHT, I'M
GOING ON BREAK.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.916
I'M HOME!

02:25.916 --> 02:28.479
COMING TO DO MY LAUNDRY.

02:28.679 --> 02:30.781
UNLESS YOU WANNA
DO IT FOR ME.

02:30.781 --> 02:34.725
I COULD USE SOME IRONING
AS WELL IF YOU WANNA...

02:34.725 --> 02:36.827
THERE'S NOTHING
RATIONAL ABOUT IT!

02:36.827 --> 02:38.158
OK!

02:38.158 --> 02:41.362
WE ARE NOT.

02:45.736 --> 02:46.297
DAD?

02:46.297 --> 02:50.601
HEY, SAM, MUST BE
LAUNDRY DAY.

02:50.601 --> 02:52.943
YEAH, IS EVERYTHING OK?

02:52.943 --> 02:54.305
I SAW YOU GUYS FIGHTING.

02:54.305 --> 02:57.648
OH, THAT, YEAH, YEAH,
NO, WE'RE--WE'RE FINE.

02:57.648 --> 03:00.951
JUST THE USUAL THINGS--
MONEY, BILLS.

03:00.951 --> 03:04.555
WHY ARE YOU STANDING
IN A CIRCLE?

03:05.456 --> 03:06.186
WOW.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.218
LOOK AT THAT. UH...

03:07.218 --> 03:08.619
I-I-I DON'T KNOW.

03:08.619 --> 03:12.223
THERE WERE, UM,
SOME KIDS IN THE--

03:12.223 --> 03:13.964
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
DOING CHALK GRAFFITI.

03:13.964 --> 03:15.826
THERE'S CHALK ON YOUR PANTS.

03:15.826 --> 03:18.429
IT'S ON YOUR HANDS, TOO.

03:18.869 --> 03:20.471
WOW, LOOK AT THAT.

03:20.471 --> 03:22.973
THAT STUFF
IS EVERYWHERE.

03:22.973 --> 03:23.734
DAMN KIDS.

03:23.734 --> 03:26.737
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M
GONNA GET THE HOSE.

03:26.737 --> 03:28.379
ALL RIGHT?

03:45.796 --> 03:49.900
[WHISTLES]
YO, SAMMY!

03:52.863 --> 03:55.766
HEY. WHAT'S THIS?

03:55.766 --> 03:56.837
THE LOTTERY DAY.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.740
JACKPOT'S UP
TO 247 MILLION.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.871
YOU WANT A QUICKPICK?

04:00.871 --> 04:02.242
NO, I'M GOOD.

04:02.242 --> 04:02.973
YOU KNOW, I GOTTA SAY,

04:02.973 --> 04:04.645
THIS IS ONE OF MY
GREATEST INVENTIONS.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.876
YOU INVENTED THE LOTTERY?

04:05.876 --> 04:06.847
YOU BETCHA.

04:06.847 --> 04:07.818
STATE SPONSORED
GAMBLING.

04:07.818 --> 04:10.421
MINIMUM WAGE EARNERS
SPENDING THEIR LAST BUCK

04:10.421 --> 04:12.683
ON AN 18 MILLION
TO ONE LONG SHOT.

04:12.683 --> 04:13.253
HA HA HA.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.586
I LIKE TO CALL IT
THE IDIOT TAX.

04:15.586 --> 04:17.758
HOW DID YOU MEET MY DAD?

04:22.593 --> 04:25.596
DIDN'T YOUR PARENTS
EVER TELL YOU?

04:25.596 --> 04:27.468
NO. ALL THEY SAID
WAS THAT MY DAD WAS SICK

04:27.468 --> 04:29.770
AND THEY MADE A DEAL
WITH YOU SO HE GOT BETTER.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.342
THEY WEREN'T GOING
TO HAVE ANY KIDS,

04:31.342 --> 04:34.004
BUT YOU TRICKED THEM
INTO HAVING ME.

04:34.705 --> 04:36.647
WELL, HEY, IF THAT'S
WHAT THEY SAID,

04:36.647 --> 04:37.878
THEN IT MUST BE TRUE.

04:37.878 --> 04:38.879
I MEAN, WHY
WOULD THEY LIE?

04:38.879 --> 04:41.382
ARE YOU SAYING
THEY'RE LYING?

04:41.382 --> 04:42.012
LISTEN, SAMMY...

04:42.012 --> 04:44.455
THEY'RE YOUR PARENTS,
AND YOU LOVE THEM,

04:44.455 --> 04:45.956
BUT PEOPLE WHO
MAKE DEALS WITH ME,

04:45.956 --> 04:49.320
GENERALLY AREN'T
BIG ON INTEGRITY.

04:49.660 --> 04:52.022
YOU CAN'T GET BLOOD
FROM A STONE.

04:52.022 --> 04:52.723
I'M JUST SAYING.

04:52.723 --> 04:54.995
BUT HERE, THIS WILL
TAKE YOUR MIND OFF IT.

04:54.995 --> 04:55.896
SIT DOWN.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.868
YOUR NEXT SOUL.

04:57.868 --> 05:02.633
MADAME OZERA,
A ROMANIAN FORTUNE TELLER
FROM THE EARLY 1900s.

05:02.633 --> 05:03.704
SHE READ TAROT CARDS?

05:03.704 --> 05:04.905
YEAH, SHE WAS
THE REAL DEAL.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.978
SOLD HER SOUL TO ME
FOR THE POWER TO PREDICT
THE FUTURE.

05:07.978 --> 05:09.640
EARNED QUITE A REPUTATION
FOR HERSELF

05:09.640 --> 05:12.483
UNTIL THE LOCAL VILLAGERS
HUNG HER FROM A TREE

05:12.483 --> 05:15.546
FOR CONSORTING
WITH THE DEVIL.

05:15.546 --> 05:18.719
SURPRISINGLY PERCEPTIVE
FOR A BUNCH OF CLODS
WITH PITCHFORKS.

05:18.719 --> 05:22.793
LET ME GUESS,
THE FORTUNE TELLER'S
BACK IN BUSINESS.

05:22.793 --> 05:25.526
WITH A VENGEANCE.

05:33.664 --> 05:37.007
OH, THAT IS JUST RUDE.

05:37.007 --> 05:37.908
YOU KNOW WHAT'S RUDE?

05:37.908 --> 05:40.040
WE HAD LUNCH PLANS
FOR AN HOUR AGO,

05:40.040 --> 05:41.111
AND WHERE WERE YOU?

05:41.111 --> 05:42.443
HERE SLEEPING.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.515
NO. WELL, NOT ANYMORE.

05:44.515 --> 05:46.116
LET'S GO GET SOME
GRUB, HUH, BABY?

05:46.116 --> 05:46.947
I ALREADY ATE.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.550
OH. IN THAT CASE, DO YOU MIND
IF I GO BACK TO SLEEP?

05:49.550 --> 05:52.623
I WAS KIND OF HAVING
A KICK ASS DREAM ABOUT ZEBRAS.

05:52.623 --> 05:53.884
YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?

05:53.884 --> 05:55.686
THEY'RE JUST BASICALLY
STRIPED HORSES.

05:55.686 --> 05:58.729
SOCK! YOU DON'T
GET THAT YOU'RE BEING
A BAD BOYFRIEND.

05:58.729 --> 06:00.090
I'M NOT BEING
A BAD BOYFRIEND.

06:00.090 --> 06:02.463
YOU NEED
TO PUT MORE ENERGY
IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.

06:02.463 --> 06:06.497
OH, MY GOD.
JOSIE, RELATIONSHIPS
AREN'T ABOUT ENERGY.

06:06.497 --> 06:09.039
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
EFFORTLESS AND EASY.

06:09.039 --> 06:11.742
PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK
AT RELATIONSHIPS!

06:11.742 --> 06:12.703
ALL THE TIME.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:12.703 --> 06:15.606
IF THIS IS JUST ANOTHER JOB
I HAVE TO KEEP, THEN I QUIT.

06:15.606 --> 06:17.007
YOU QUIT?

06:17.007 --> 06:18.549
YOU'RE FIRED!

06:18.549 --> 06:20.010
OUCH.

06:20.010 --> 06:21.982
MM-HMM. AND WE'RE OVER.

06:21.982 --> 06:22.953
OH. SO CLEVER.

06:22.953 --> 06:27.017
NEVER HEARD THAT
ONE BEFORE. MMM.

06:27.418 --> 06:28.989
YOU GUYS BROKE UP AGAIN?

06:28.989 --> 06:30.561
SHE'LL BE BACK.

06:30.561 --> 06:33.393
THE DANCE CONTINUES.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.508
STEVE?

07:06.757 --> 07:08.028
SOCK, SOCK, LOOK.

07:08.028 --> 07:08.599
WHAT?

07:08.599 --> 07:10.631
IT CAME BACK THROUGH TWO
COATS OF FRESH PAINT.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.432
HUH. TOUGH
LITTLE BASTARD.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.434
YOU DON'T SEE STEVE AT ALL?

07:14.434 --> 07:15.666
UNICORN,

07:15.666 --> 07:16.537
WEREWOLF.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.638
END OF DISCUSSION.

07:17.638 --> 07:21.171
ALSO LOOKS LIKE
THE WEREWOLF GREW
A NICE SET OF JUGS.

07:21.171 --> 07:23.213
AW, SAM, SOCK.

07:23.213 --> 07:24.745
HEY, TONY, HOW YOU DOING?

07:24.745 --> 07:27.447
I GOT A QUESTION.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.949
YOU SEE ANYTHING?

07:28.949 --> 07:29.920
IT LOOKS LIKE BLACK MOLD.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.181
YOU SHOULD HAVE
THAT REMEDIATED.

07:31.181 --> 07:32.483
IT'S SUPER TOXIC.

07:32.483 --> 07:36.056
HEY, YOU GUYS, I NEED
TO ASK, UM, A FAVOR.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.187
DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

07:37.187 --> 07:38.689
YEAH, YEAH, SURE,
WHATEVER.

07:38.689 --> 07:39.630
I CAN'T REALLY
DISCUSS IT HERE.

07:39.630 --> 07:45.596
WE NEED TO DISCUSS
IT SOMEWHERE A LITTLE
BIT MORE CIRCULAR.

07:51.602 --> 07:53.674
HERE WE GO, OK.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.245
ALMOST.
ALL RIGHT.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.948
OW.

07:57.948 --> 08:01.682
3 DUDES IN A TENT, SEXY.

08:05.055 --> 08:07.558
WE HAVE A NEW PLAN.

08:07.558 --> 08:08.188
WHAT IS THIS?

08:08.188 --> 08:10.961
IT'S A CAGE, DESIGNED
MILLENNIA AGO

08:10.961 --> 08:13.063
BY KING SOLOMON
AND IN THIS CAGE,

08:13.063 --> 08:17.768
SOLOMON
CAPTURED ASMODEUS,
KING OF DEMONS.

08:17.768 --> 08:19.600
ITS STRENGTH
IS UNBOUNDED

08:19.600 --> 08:23.233
AND WE'RE GOING
TO USE IT TO TRAP

08:23.233 --> 08:24.775
AND BIND THE DEVIL.

08:24.775 --> 08:25.175
FOREVER.

08:25.175 --> 08:28.639
NO, TONY, THE LAST TIME YOU
TRIED TO DEFEAT THE DEVIL,

08:28.639 --> 08:30.110
IT ENDED IN DEATH
AND DESTRUCTION.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.242
I MEAN, COME ON, YOU GOT
TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

08:32.242 --> 08:35.816
I HAVE, SAM.
WE WILL SUCCEED.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.287
I DON'T WANT
TO BE INVOLVED.

08:37.287 --> 08:40.551
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT ASKING
YOU TO BE INVOLVED, SAM,

08:40.551 --> 08:42.522
BUT THIS CAGE IS
GOING TO NEED PLENTY

08:42.522 --> 08:47.558
OF SUPPLIES, SO I ONLY
NEED ONE THING FROM YOU.

08:49.900 --> 08:52.262
YOUR EMPLOYEE DISCOUNT.

08:52.262 --> 08:53.564
OH. OK.

08:53.564 --> 08:55.566
NO, WAIT, USE MINE,
USE MINE, TONY.

08:55.566 --> 08:57.237
I WANT THE COMMISSION.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.570

08:59.570 --> 09:01.071
HERE YOU GO.

09:02.673 --> 09:04.575

GRAB THE REST.

09:04.575 --> 09:07.277
UH, I'LL BE RIGHT IN.

09:07.277 --> 09:09.820
UH...

09:13.053 --> 09:16.326
JUST WANTED TO COME OVER
AND SAY THANK YOU.

09:16.326 --> 09:17.057
FOR WHAT?

09:17.057 --> 09:20.591
WELL, I THINK WHAT
YOU DEMONS ARE DOING
TO EL DIABLO IS AWESOME.

09:20.591 --> 09:23.764
I'M ALL ABOUT FIGHTING THE
POWER, TAKING DOWN "THE MAN."

09:23.764 --> 09:24.735

09:31.271 --> 09:33.704
LET ME TAKE
A LOOK AT THIS.

09:33.704 --> 09:35.906

I'M GONNA GO IN

09:35.906 --> 09:40.611

FOR YOU AND YOU STAY PUT, OK?

09:40.611 --> 09:41.682
I APPRECIATE THAT.

CUTE HORNS, BY THE WAY.

09:43.954 --> 09:46.116
NOT CREEPY AT ALL.

09:48.258 --> 09:51.792
MMM. OK, I'LL BE BACK.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.034

OF LIFE YOU ARE.

10:08.138 --> 10:12.943
YEAH, I GUESS IT IS PRETTY
AMAZING HOW FULL OF LIFE I AM.

10:12.943 --> 10:15.315
IT'S COMING OUT
OF EVERY HOLE.

KISS ME.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.348
UM, WHAT?

I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

10:25.996 --> 10:29.029
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW,
WE'RE ON A BREAK.

10:29.029 --> 10:29.800
IT JUST HAPPENED THOUGH.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.332
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT THE RULES ARE ON
THAT, SO I, YOU KNOW...

10:32.332 --> 10:35.866
JUST THINK OF IT
AS A THANK YOU FOR
ALL YOUR HELP.

10:35.866 --> 10:41.641
OK. I WILL THINK
OF IT LIKE THAT.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.173

CATCH MY BREATH.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.882

11:45.075 --> 11:45.906
THAT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

11:45.906 --> 11:49.379

YOU WANT ME TO HIRE
A DOMINATRIX?

12:09.860 --> 12:12.933

THINKING THAT MAYBE
THIS COULD HELP US

ALTHOUGH I CAN'T FIND

LOOKS LIKE STEVE?

ON THE SECURITY MONITOR
LOOKING RIGHT AT ME.

12:50.300 --> 12:53.003
AND NOW THE STAIN'S
BACK, AND I'M THINKING,

12:53.003 --> 12:55.445
IS THIS ALL IN MY HEAD?
IS THIS ACTUALLY--

12:55.445 --> 12:56.977

THAT CRAZY AT ALL.

TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.399
THEN WHY DOESN'T
HE JUST SAY IT?

WHY DID GOD APPEAR
TO MOSES AS A BURNING BUSH?

13:22.232 --> 13:25.175
OR WHY DO ANGELS
APPEAR IN DREAMS?

13:25.175 --> 13:27.978

THEY NEED TO PREPARE YOU

NEVER WORK ON ME.

POWER TO ENSNARE A DEMON,

CAPTURE HIS SON.

GREATER THAN WE KNOW?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.504
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
HE CAN'T CONTROL THEM.

A BETTER TIME TO CAPTURE

ENOUGH ENERGY TO SCRATCH
MY JUNK DRAWER.

MAKE ONE LITTLE PIT STOP

17:52.442 --> 17:54.174
BEFORE WE GO SOUL
NABBING, ALL RIGHT?

WAIT UNTIL I...

17:58.378 --> 18:02.752
NO, NO, SAM!
THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR ME!

18:02.752 --> 18:04.184
OK?

18:05.255 --> 18:06.286
OK.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.188
LET'S GO.

18:25.875 --> 18:26.376
YEAH.

18:26.376 --> 18:28.438
THESE ARE TOO HEAVY
TO HAUL BY HAND.

18:28.438 --> 18:31.841
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO BRING IN A FORKLIFT.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.119
HEY, WHAT
A COOL SURPRISE.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.352
YEAH, WE NEED TO TALK.

18:43.153 --> 18:44.824
ABOUT THE KISS.

18:47.157 --> 18:49.259
OK.

18:52.202 --> 18:55.165
I'M REALLY SORRY THAT
I KISSED YOU, SOCK.

18:55.165 --> 18:57.637
IT WAS RECKLESS
AND SELFISH OF ME

18:57.637 --> 18:58.908
AND IT'LL NEVER
HAPPEN AGAIN.

18:58.908 --> 18:59.769
SELFISH? WHAT?

18:59.769 --> 19:02.842
NO. NO, NO, NO.
NO, I DUG IT.

19:02.842 --> 19:03.243
REALLY?

19:03.243 --> 19:05.515
WELL, I DON'T ACTUALLY
REMEMBER THE KISS

19:05.515 --> 19:06.816
BECAUSE I BLACKED OUT.

19:06.816 --> 19:07.717
BUT HOW I FELT AFTERWARDS,

19:07.717 --> 19:11.521
IT WAS AMAZING, BUT
THEN CAME THE CRASH.

19:11.521 --> 19:14.524
THERE'S A REASON
FOR THAT.

19:14.524 --> 19:14.884
OH, YEAH?

19:14.884 --> 19:16.586
I'M A SPECIAL KIND
OF DEMON.

19:16.586 --> 19:17.827
OK.
A SUCCUBUS.

19:17.827 --> 19:18.828
A SUCCU-WHAT?

19:18.828 --> 19:20.760
IT MEANS I FEED
ON HUMAN LIFE FORCE.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.293
YOU FEEL REALLY GREAT
IN THE SHORT TERM,

19:23.293 --> 19:26.196
BUT EVERY TIME
I KISS YOU,

19:26.196 --> 19:30.800
IT SORT OF SHAVES ABOUT
A YEAR OFF YOUR LIFE.

19:31.571 --> 19:35.375
UH, BUT THAT WOULD BE THE
ASS-END OF MY LIFE, RIGHT?

19:35.375 --> 19:38.248
THE CRAPPY YEARS, RIGHT?

19:38.248 --> 19:40.480
I REALLY LIKE YOU, SOCK.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.712
THAT'S WHY IT CAN
NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

19:42.712 --> 19:45.415
RIGHT. RIGHT,
THAT MAKES SENSE.

19:45.415 --> 19:46.756
YEAH.
TOTALLY.

19:46.756 --> 19:48.718
TOTALLY MAKING
SENSE TO ME NOW.

19:48.718 --> 19:51.391
I MEAN, WHAT THROWING
AWAY A YEAR OF YOUR LIFE

19:51.391 --> 19:52.922
FOR THE BEST HIGH
ANYONE'S EVER FELT?

19:52.922 --> 19:54.824
THAT'S CRAZY!
YEAH.

19:54.824 --> 19:56.866
STUPID.

19:56.866 --> 19:59.399
[SIGHS]

19:59.929 --> 20:03.833
OK, ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I HAVE A PROPOSITION FOR YOU.

20:03.833 --> 20:04.304
OK.

20:04.304 --> 20:09.208
WHAT IF WE AGREE
TO HOOK UP ONCE A YEAR?

20:09.208 --> 20:09.879
YOU THINK?

20:09.879 --> 20:10.440
YEAH!

20:10.440 --> 20:12.782
BECAUSE THEN I DON'T HAVE
TO DIE OR WHATEVER RIGHT AWAY

20:12.782 --> 20:14.684
AND WE BOTH GET OUR FIX.

20:14.684 --> 20:16.215
THAT COULD WORK.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.287
THAT COULD TOTALLY WORK.

20:17.287 --> 20:19.789
GOOD, OK, GOOD, AW.

20:19.789 --> 20:21.621
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING
FOR NEW YEAR'S THEN?

20:21.621 --> 20:23.993
NOTHING!
ME NEITHER! FANTASTIBLE!

20:23.993 --> 20:24.924
OK, GOOD.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.696
SO THAT'S LIKE WHAT...

20:26.696 --> 20:29.859

20:41.240 --> 20:41.611
TONY!

20:41.611 --> 20:45.375
HEY, SAMMY, YOU BRING
THE REST OF THE SUPPLIES?

20:45.375 --> 20:45.945
YEAH.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.717
