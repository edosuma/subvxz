00:31.000 --> 00:35.280
Daniel? Any ideas about this place?

00:35.440 --> 00:39.880
It looks like it was built by an advanced
culture, then stripped and deserted.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.720
The MALP showed no life signs.

00:52.360 --> 00:54.680
Teal'c. What do you think?

00:54.840 --> 00:57.160
It is an ancient Goa'uld design.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.760
Now, that is not a good smell.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.840
Jesus!

01:35.520 --> 01:37.640
All right, level A.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.240
- (Teal'c) Here's another one.
- (O'Neill) More there.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.160
(Carter) These aren't quite human.
They're Goa'uld.

03:05.960 --> 03:09.440
(Teal'c) This mechanism seems to have
been damaged by a ribbon device.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.440
(Carter) Maybe they wanted
to contain whatever did this.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.360
(Daniel) Teal'c,
do you recognise this symbol?

03:17.320 --> 03:21.240
- It is the crest of the Linvris.
- (O'Neill) Which is what? Or who?

03:21.400 --> 03:24.320
A league of lesser Goa'uld
who challenge the System Lords.

03:24.480 --> 03:27.480
- A minor league?
- Yes. There are nine.

03:29.040 --> 03:33.480
Five... six, seven, eight, nine.
Found 'em.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.720
(Daniel) It's a Goa'uld tablet device,
like we found on Argos.

03:37.880 --> 03:41.280
- Can you translate it?
- Part of it. It's some sort of battle plan.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.840
I need the hand device
to make the screen go to the next page.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.760
That thing?

04:01.080 --> 04:02.080
(whoosh)

04:05.200 --> 04:06.960
Nothing's happening.

04:09.240 --> 04:12.400
- What?
- I felt something brush by me.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.160
All right, let's pack it outta here.

04:19.320 --> 04:22.760
Leave this to the medical containment
unit. It's getting creepy.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.320
(woman whispers) Doctor Jackson?

04:45.480 --> 04:47.400
Out in a minute!

04:50.920 --> 04:52.840
(whispers) Doctor Jackson!

05:21.120 --> 05:22.840
Daniel.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.080
- Were you calling me just now?
- No.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.440
You weren't calling me
in the locker roo
