<i>Hey, kid, next time,</i>

<i>They're pros.</i>

Ah, another delightful evening
of "amateur menacing the city."

[dog barking]

00:20.103 --> 00:22.606
Cody, come back here!

00:27.110 --> 00:30.322
Worst is, I'm partially
to blame for my new bad rap,

00:30.322 --> 00:34.826
since I'm the one selling
J. Jonah Jameson that footage
so I can pay for school.

00:34.826 --> 00:38.830
Who needs super‐villains
when you can be your own
worst enemy?

00:43.752 --> 00:44.962
[horn blares]
Huh?

00:46.255 --> 00:48.090
So maybe I've made
a few mistakes.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.175
I'm still
pretty new at this.
[laughs]

00:50.175 --> 00:53.470

a superhero instruction manual.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.771
I bet even the Avengers
aren't always perfect.

01:02.771 --> 01:06.191
Thor probably throws
loud parties with
his obnoxious Viking friends.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.527
I bet Tony leaves
hair gel everywhere.

01:08.527 --> 01:12.239
And Hulk?
Being angry and unlikable

Why am I the only one‐‐

01:13.865 --> 01:17.077

My old enemy, the Vulture.

01:17.077 --> 01:20.539
So much for Adrian Toomes
going into hiding
after prison.

01:20.539 --> 01:23.166
Whoa! Two Vultures?

01:23.166 --> 01:26.253
Well, like they say,
taking down two villains
is better than one.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.797
Actually, I have no idea
if anyone's ever said that.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.882
Wait. You're not Toomes,
are you?

Spider‐Man, we were hoping
we'd cross your path.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.603
Time for a little fun.

Gotta post this. Nice!

02:09.504 --> 02:12.132
Are these guys putting on
a fully rehearsed air show?

What the what?
[exclaiming continues]

02:14.176 --> 02:17.095
[male teen]
I didn't know the Wake Riders
were in New York!

02:17.095 --> 02:20.807
Yo, Spidey,
I caught you on the news.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.143
You got some serious skills.
Come on.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.604
Let's give the crowd
what they want. Boom!

Wait. What?

02:26.980 --> 02:30.025
Trust us.

Wait. That wasn't it?

was so cool?

thanks to pulling off this stunt
with the most epically awesome
superhero in New York City.

04:40.864 --> 04:44.743
And BT‐dub, great first test
of our new flight gear, Riders.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.454
Where did you get
these wing suits?

04:47.454 --> 04:50.373
They look... familiar.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.083
Built them all myself.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.503
A perfect blend
of high tech and showbiz.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.839
But this gear pales compared
to your natural skills, man.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.634
I'm thinking this'll be
our most watched stunt.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.428
Until tomorrow, you mean.
Mm.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.347
Let's make this
a thing, bro.

05:05.347 --> 05:08.183
"Spider‐Man
and the Wake Riders."

05:08.183 --> 05:09.768
What's more epic than that?

05:09.768 --> 05:13.104
4:00 p. m. at the old
Pemberton Building site,
maÃ±ana.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.524
See you there?
Oh, uh‐‐

05:15.524 --> 05:18.777
So cool
to actually meet you.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.074
[growls]

05:27.077 --> 05:30.831
Oh, man! I can't believe
you did a stunt
with the Wake Riders!

05:30.831 --> 05:33.416
First I thought they were
some kind of Vulture army,

05:33.416 --> 05:35.377
but they turned out
to be awesome.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.879
You're a fan?
Try "obsessed with them."

05:37.879 --> 05:39.464
You're the luckiest
guy ever.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.216
People cheered for me.
[chuckles]

05:41.216 --> 05:43.385
It's been a while
since that's happened.

05:43.385 --> 05:46.263
Uh, yeah.
You're the number one
trending topic right now.

05:46.263 --> 05:50.433
Not like "menace" trending,
but, like, "people actually
like you" trending.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.770
Our whole material science class
was watching it
when I walked in.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.314
Thirty million views?!

05:56.314 --> 05:59.442

compete with that.

<i>Whoa, Pete!</i>

06:05.949 --> 06:08.034
Didn't know you were a fan
of the Wake Riders.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.787
<i>You know about the Wake Riders</i>
<i>all the way over there</i>
<i>in Europe?</i>

06:10.787 --> 06:13.039

<i>about them except me?</i>

06:13.039 --> 06:14.749
You were never
the trendiest guy.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.085
I am today, apparently.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.004
A question, though.

06:19.004 --> 06:21.798
Oscorp hasn't lost
any Vulture gear recently,
have they?

06:21.798 --> 06:23.341
<i>You're wondering</i>
<i>if they stole it.</i>

06:23.341 --> 06:25.385
<i>Look, Oscorp's</i>
<i>had some break‐ins</i>

06:25.385 --> 06:27.512
<i>since my dad died,</i>
<i>but I doubt it's them.</i>

06:27.512 --> 06:30.140
<i>Barkley Blitz is famous</i>
<i>for creating his own gear.</i>

06:30.140 --> 06:33.518
<i>Don't turn this into</i>
<i>something it's not.</i>
<i>Just enjoy it.</i>

06:33.518 --> 06:36.354
Huh. Maybe I will.

06:40.984 --> 06:45.447
Don't tell me.
Your next stunt is still
under construction?

06:45.447 --> 06:47.198
Spider‐bro!

06:47.198 --> 06:49.784
Didn't I tell you guys?
Spidey wouldn't let me down.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.787
Well, despite my screaming
and general confusion,

06:52.787 --> 06:55.498
I had fun yesterday.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.958
So, what's today's
big stunt?

06:56.958 --> 06:59.169
Sheer epic‐ness.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.633
I fly up into the stratosphere
in this atmospheric balloon,

07:04.633 --> 07:07.469
then I'll freefall,
aiming right
where we're standing.

07:07.469 --> 07:10.347
But then‐‐ big drama‐‐
I'll pretend my suit fails,

07:10.347 --> 07:12.849
and you catch me.
Catch you?

07:12.849 --> 07:14.851
Your velocity's gonna be
so extreme‐‐

07:14.851 --> 07:17.103
Hey, don't overthink it, brah.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.939
You'll figure it out.
You're <i>the</i> Spider‐Man.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.567
I trust you with my life.

07:24.903 --> 07:28.573
[bystanders exclaiming]

07:28.573 --> 07:31.076
Wow!
What's that?

07:31.076 --> 07:34.287
The Wake Riders again?!
[promoter]
Prepare to be amazed.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.582
The Wake Riders
will blow your mind
with Spider‐Man by their side.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.417
Who wants to buy
a Wake Rider T‐shirt?

07:39.417 --> 07:41.753
Oh! Do you know
Spider‐Man too?

07:41.753 --> 07:44.506
I do.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.841
In fact, I'm his promoter.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.843
Who wants his autograph
after this?

07:48.843 --> 07:51.554
[crowd shouting]

07:51.554 --> 07:53.932
[promoter]
Hey, kid!

07:53.932 --> 07:56.267
Hey!
I'm the promoter here.

07:56.267 --> 08:00.021

of a little competition?

08:11.700 --> 08:14.786
[wind howling]

08:14.786 --> 08:17.122
Come on, Spidey.
Don't let me down, bro.
[grunts]

08:20.709 --> 08:24.546
Blitz has more faith in me
than I have in myself.
Can't mess this up.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.881
If he comes in
at the speed I expect,

08:26.881 --> 08:30.051
his momentum
could only be slowed
by the tensile strength of‐‐

08:30.051 --> 08:31.386
Got it!

08:31.386 --> 08:32.971
Each web net will slow

08:32.971 --> 08:37.058
his velocity exponentially
until he safely stops.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.601
[explosion]

08:38.601 --> 08:41.104
A crime? Right now?

08:41.104 --> 08:43.440
Uh, okay.
Blitz should be covered.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.692
Maybe I have time to‐‐
What?

08:45.692 --> 08:48.153
No! He's coming down
in the wrong location!

08:48.153 --> 08:51.573
The most amazing stunt
of all time
is going to make me famous.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.408
For destroying the Wake Riders!

08:57.328 --> 08:59.622
Blitz misjudged
the air currents.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.125
I am not ready for this.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.004
Oh, no!

09:06.004 --> 09:08.214
Blitz's wings won't open!
[bystanders exclaiming]

09:08.214 --> 09:11.926
What?! He'll smash
right into the ground!

09:11.926 --> 09:15.388
Come on, Spidey!
Web like you've never
webbed before!

09:26.232 --> 09:29.694
Nice! I knew you'd
find a way, Spidey.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.614
[both yell]

09:32.614 --> 09:34.616
[grunts]
[Blitz]
Now take a bow.

09:34.616 --> 09:35.992
[exclaiming]

09:35.992 --> 09:39.662
Ha! Menace who?
You rule, Spidey!

09:39.662 --> 09:41.623
This stunt
will break the Internet.

09:44.375 --> 09:47.128
[exclaiming continues]

09:52.175 --> 09:54.552
[grunts]
Hey! Where you going?

09:54.552 --> 09:56.721
We gotta celebrate, brah.
Sorry.

09:56.721 --> 10:00.391
I gotta handle something.
I'll be right back... brah!

10:05.605 --> 10:09.192
Still here? What,
are you going for the record
for slowest robbery ever?

10:09.192 --> 10:10.985
Who are you, Turtle Man?

10:10.985 --> 10:12.821
[sonic scream blares]

10:12.821 --> 10:15.198
Aah!
[grunts]

10:15.198 --> 10:18.493
I forgot how much
I hate that sonic scream.
[sonic scream blares]

10:25.458 --> 10:27.585
Time to catch up
on some fly‐fishing.

10:27.585 --> 10:30.296
Yeah, I said that.
[grunts]

10:30.296 --> 10:32.715
[grunts, groans]

10:34.008 --> 10:36.970
[electricity arcing]

10:36.970 --> 10:39.264
The original
wing‐suit guy

10:39.264 --> 10:41.641
hanging out
near the Wake Riders.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.184
What, seeing them
made you jealous?

10:43.184 --> 10:45.812
Of course not.
But seeing you working

10:45.812 --> 10:48.815
with those extreme criminals
has made me disgusted.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.859
What are you talking about,
Toomes?

10:50.859 --> 10:53.653
Who do you think
robbed that lab?

10:53.653 --> 10:57.740
You. I came to that conclusion
because I caught you doing it.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.701
Really? And did you
know the whereabouts

10:59.701 --> 11:01.786
of all the Wake Riders
during that stunt?

11:01.786 --> 11:04.122
[scoffs]
Yes.

11:04.122 --> 11:07.125
Ha! You only think you did.
But I tracked them.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.085
After they escorted
that balloon in the air,

11:09.085 --> 11:11.838
<i>they used the fireworks</i>
<i>as a diversion</i>
<i>for their break‐in‐‐</i>

11:11.838 --> 11:14.299
<i>to steal solar power packs</i>
<i>from this lab.</i>

11:14.299 --> 11:17.844
<i>This is what they do‐‐</i>
<i>use stunts as cover</i>
<i>to steal gear.</i>

11:17.844 --> 11:20.221
<i>Not only did they steal</i>
<i>my tech from Oscorp,</i>

11:20.221 --> 11:22.724
they've been pulling off
these heists across the globe!

11:22.724 --> 11:25.810
Well, if that's true,
why haven't you gone
to the authorities?

11:25.810 --> 11:27.520
No real proof.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.814
I tried to catch them
in the act,
but it was too late.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.692
I'm sorry, Toomes.
Not buying it.

11:32.692 --> 11:36.070
I've never seen Blitz
or any of the Wake Riders
do one thing wrong.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.822
You, on the other hand...

11:37.822 --> 11:41.242
I spent a lifetime perfecting
my scientific breakthroughs,

11:41.242 --> 11:43.786
but my mistakes in the past year
have branded me a criminal.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.663
And that I'm gonna change.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.790
When did you become so noble?

11:47.790 --> 11:49.918
I'm not a villain, Spider‐Man.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.837
I'm a scientist who got blinded
to what's right and wrong.

11:52.837 --> 11:56.424
Can you imagine what it's like
to be branded something
you're not?

11:56.424 --> 11:57.717
Maybe.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.761
I want the name
Adrian Toomes

11:59.761 --> 12:03.056
to stand for
scientific achievements,
not criminal mistakes.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.643
And the Wake Riders,
using my gear, threaten
to destroy all of that.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.061
[Blitz]
There's Spider‐Man!

12:08.061 --> 12:10.939
Hey! You missed the crowd!

12:10.939 --> 12:12.190
Hmm...

12:14.567 --> 12:16.819
The biggest audience
we've ever had.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.073
I got a little...
sidetracked.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.325
Well, don't get
sidetracked tomorrow.

12:22.325 --> 12:23.910
You're an honorary Wake Rider,

12:23.910 --> 12:26.204
the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.206
Tomorrow will be
our biggest stunt yet,

12:28.206 --> 12:29.916
and it won't work
without you.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.751
You need me
for every stunt?

12:31.751 --> 12:34.087
You're part of
the team now, bro.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.674
Look, we're good,
but you, my friend,
are like a master.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.134
Tomorrow, Erskin Center,
3:00 p. m.?

12:40.134 --> 12:42.053
I'll be there.

12:42.053 --> 12:43.054
Boom!

12:43.054 --> 12:45.056
It's gonna be epic!

12:46.891 --> 12:48.726
Huh. Every Wake Rider stunt

12:48.726 --> 12:51.271
does correspond
with a high‐tech crime.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.983
But Toomes is a criminal,
and Blitz has a clean record.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.401
Who do I trust?

12:56.401 --> 12:57.777
Hey, Double‐P,

12:57.777 --> 13:00.571
can you sign all these
Spider‐Man pics?

13:02.615 --> 13:04.867
Uh, why do you have
all these?

13:04.867 --> 13:07.412
Ah, just doing
what a promoter does.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.914
Spider‐Man doesn't
have a promoter.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.708
Pete, I'm‐‐

13:11.708 --> 13:13.835
we're gonna make
a killing off this.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.878
That balloon stunt
got 40 million hits.

13:15.878 --> 13:19.507
Your collab with the Wake Riders
could translate into cash,

13:19.507 --> 13:23.261
which means
never having to worry
about tuition ever again.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.762
[sighs]

13:24.762 --> 13:28.474
You don't seem as excited
about this as you should.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.269
Hypothetically,
if I gave you
a solar power pack,

13:31.269 --> 13:35.064
nano‐tech armor plating,
and propulsion boosters,
what would you build?

13:35.064 --> 13:37.066
Um, strange question.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.695
But obviously,
I'd build a rocket
that'd go straight into orbit.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.363
I mean, what else
would all that be for?

13:42.363 --> 13:44.699
For a personal jet‐suit!

13:44.699 --> 13:48.494
Except you'd need extremely
lightweight polymer wings.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.038
Exactly.

13:52.331 --> 13:56.294
So... you're not
signing these?

14:04.218 --> 14:06.137
Dude, where's my glossy?

14:06.137 --> 14:08.181
Soon. Spider‐Man's
very busy.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.433
Yeah, he is.
The Wake Riders

14:10.433 --> 14:13.227
are over the Erskin Center
right now!

14:20.401 --> 14:22.695
[excited chattering]

14:27.575 --> 14:31.204
Midday, no alarms, no worries.

14:39.587 --> 14:40.588
[beeps]

14:41.923 --> 14:43.466
Score.

14:48.471 --> 14:52.225
Hey, the show's
across the street.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.144
Oh! Spider‐bro, I was just‐‐

14:55.144 --> 14:59.107
Printing out illegal
polymer compound wings
from the material science lab?

14:59.107 --> 15:01.400
Dude, it's not
what it looks like.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.695
So you're not going
to combine these with
everything else you've stolen

15:04.695 --> 15:07.365
to create the world's
fastest rocket suit?

15:07.365 --> 15:11.119
How many more fans
will that get you?
And how much more money?

15:11.119 --> 15:14.580
[growls]
I thought you were cool, man.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.125
But don't feel bad.
You did your part.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.253
You upped our flash mob crowds
by almost 40 percent,

15:20.253 --> 15:23.881
keeping everyone's eyes
on the show,
including the police.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.926
Totally made
our secret missions
here easier.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.469
You used me.

15:28.469 --> 15:31.973
Yep. And now
you're all used up.

15:32.932 --> 15:36.561
[crying out]

15:36.561 --> 15:38.396
Being right really hurts!

15:40.356 --> 15:43.109
Aahh!
[grunting]

15:43.109 --> 15:46.154
[yells]

15:47.989 --> 15:49.782
[groaning]

15:49.782 --> 15:51.951
Spidey,
you're too old school.
[grunts]

15:51.951 --> 15:53.369
This is the new economy.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.538
We do what we want,
take what we want,

15:55.538 --> 15:57.999
and the world watches us online
like heroes.

15:57.999 --> 16:01.169
But do you have any idea
how competitive it is out there?
[groaning]

16:01.169 --> 16:03.254
We need to keep
our fans interested,

16:03.254 --> 16:05.214
with new gear
like this suit‐‐

16:05.214 --> 16:06.966
[sonic scream blaring]
Aahh!

16:06.966 --> 16:09.927
I hate that sonic scream!
Sorry, half‐wit.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.721
That is my tech.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.723
Ugh! My ears are ringing!

16:13.723 --> 16:16.475
[shouting]
How did you find me?
Am I screaming?

16:16.475 --> 16:19.604
I created a weapon to shut down
their stolen Vulture gear.

16:19.604 --> 16:22.648
Its targeting system tracked
his power generator.

16:22.648 --> 16:26.277
Now to stop
this imposter for good.

16:26.277 --> 16:29.447
Guys, get over here.
Spidey's onto us.

16:29.447 --> 16:32.450
But you'll never guess
who just showed up.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.914
[grunts]
Please, sir,
you don't understand.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.208
This is all
about your tech.

16:40.208 --> 16:43.127
You're right.
It is... thief!

16:43.127 --> 16:44.212
Whoa!

16:48.841 --> 16:50.092
Cool!

16:50.092 --> 16:51.636
Is Horizon
part of the show?

16:51.636 --> 16:54.430
Yeah, I don't think so.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.565
Sorry, Spider‐Man.
It was fun while it lasted.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.654
[groaning]

17:12.073 --> 17:14.033
Aahh‐‐
Wait!

17:14.033 --> 17:16.369
I‐I don't want
to fight you.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.914
You're‐‐ You're my hero.
Our hero.

17:19.914 --> 17:22.416
What?
All the robberies,

17:22.416 --> 17:25.836
all the stunts to cover them,
are so we could upgrade
this Vulture tech.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.047
We're trying to live up
to your genius.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.633
Why do you think
we're called the Wake Riders?

17:30.633 --> 17:34.053
A wake.
It's a group of vultures.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.231
[both grunt]
Looks like I have to
clip your wings!

17:45.231 --> 17:46.857
[grunts]
[grunts, groans]

17:46.857 --> 17:50.069
Get it? It's a bird joke.
[web shooter deploys]

17:50.069 --> 17:52.238
I hope you
like it, sir.

17:52.238 --> 17:55.032
That new rocket suit
will be put to better use
on you.

17:55.032 --> 17:58.119
And I can't tell you
the honor I have
wearing your old‐school wings.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.663
[Spider‐Man]
Wait. Aren't you two
supposed to be fighting?

18:00.663 --> 18:03.249
So shortsighted,
Spider‐Man.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.585
This is what
I'm supposed to be doing‐‐

18:05.585 --> 18:07.878
assuming
my rightful position.

18:11.382 --> 18:14.885
Is that
Adrian Toomes himself?

18:14.885 --> 18:17.597
I think you mean...
our new leader.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.600
What happened to repairing
your name, Toomes?

18:20.600 --> 18:23.144
Wanting the world
to recognize
your accomplishments?

18:23.144 --> 18:25.896
Exactly what I'm doing,
Spider‐Man.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.824
Is this the legacy
you want?

18:36.824 --> 18:40.119
Leading a wake of Vultures
who I inspire?

18:40.119 --> 18:43.164
I think it's exactly
what I deserve.

18:43.164 --> 18:46.250
And I think you all deserve
to be put behind bars.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.294
My Wake Riders, attack!

18:48.294 --> 18:50.087
Aah!
[grunting]
Don't let him get away!

18:50.087 --> 18:51.631
[chuckles]

18:59.597 --> 19:01.515
[grunts]

19:11.984 --> 19:15.237
Aah!
[grunting]

19:15.237 --> 19:17.448
[Vulture]
Wake Riders,
time to accomplish

19:17.448 --> 19:19.492
what everyone else
has failed to do.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.785
Finish him!

19:20.785 --> 19:23.204
[grunting]

19:23.204 --> 19:25.289
[blow lands]
Aahh!

19:26.332 --> 19:28.167
[both grunt]

19:28.167 --> 19:30.503
[grunts]

19:30.503 --> 19:32.338
[sonic scream starts, stops]
[muffled grunt]

19:32.338 --> 19:35.549
I can't believe I was
such a fan of those guys.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.176
[sonic scream blares]

19:37.176 --> 19:39.053
[both grunt]

19:40.304 --> 19:42.556
[sonic scream blares]

19:42.556 --> 19:45.893
Sorry, bro,
but this ends now.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.144
[grunts]

19:48.187 --> 19:49.689
[grunts]
Toomes' weapon.

20:02.326 --> 20:06.247
Yes, it does... bro.
[grunts]

20:06.247 --> 20:07.623
[grunts]

20:07.623 --> 20:10.918
[sonic scream blaring]
Whoa‐oa‐oa!

20:12.545 --> 20:16.215
This does not end here,
Spider‐Man!

20:17.758 --> 20:19.301
[Blitz groans]

20:19.301 --> 20:22.513
Is Vulture cool, or what?
[grunts]

20:26.100 --> 20:28.227
[crowd exclaiming]

20:32.523 --> 20:37.945
These athletes
were framed by the menace
known as Spider‐Man.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.573
<i>So Spider‐Man framed</i>
<i>the Wake Riders?</i>

20:40.573 --> 20:44.326
<i>Not only is he</i>
<i>menacing our city,</i>
<i>he's corrupting our youth!</i>

20:44.326 --> 20:49.290
So, I, um, still have
700 glossies of you,

20:49.290 --> 20:51.876
unsigned,
sitting in my lab.

20:51.876 --> 20:55.713
You want them?
No, but I'm sure
J. J. J. would.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.965
To rip 'em up on TV.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.592
Yeah, you'd think
being superheroes

20:59.592 --> 21:02.219
would make us the most popular
people in the world.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.513
But that's not why
we do this, is it?

21:04.513 --> 21:06.807
Then how do we know we're
making the world better?

21:13.647 --> 21:16.358
Spidey? You rule, man!

21:16.358 --> 21:18.360
I don't care
what anyone says.

21:18.360 --> 21:22.698
You just gotta notice it
in the little things.
[web shooters deploying]

21:22.698 --> 21:25.409
Spider high five, kid!
[laughs]

21:25.409 --> 21:27.953
[grunts, laughs]
