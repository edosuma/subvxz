01:16.869 --> 01:20.037
We are gathered here today
to immortalize in song

01:20.164 --> 01:23.624
the life and untimely death
of a great legend.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.043
- Rango.
- So sit back, relax,

01:26.170 --> 01:30.047
and enjoy your low-calorie popcorn
and assorted confections

01:30.174 --> 01:34.969
while we tell you the strange
and bewildering tale of a hero

01:35.053 --> 01:38.514
who has yet to enter his own story.

01:53.197 --> 01:55.907
Crunchy, creamy, cookie,
candy, cupcake.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.410
Okay, everybody,
let's take it from the top.

02:00.746 --> 02:04.248
The stage is set,
the night moist with apprehension.

02:04.333 --> 02:08.336
Alone in her chamber, the princess
prepares to take her own life.

02:09.045 --> 02:12.924
"It is far better to nourish worms
than to live without love."

02:13.008 --> 02:14.926
She reaches for the poisoned chalice.

02:15.052 --> 02:18.387
Meanwhile, the wicked Malvolio
plots his ascension to the throne

02:18.889 --> 02:20.890
while her aging father lies gravely ill.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.559
"Yes, I am gravely ill."

02:24.770 --> 02:26.896
"Hark, who goes there?"

02:27.105 --> 02:29.524
'Tis I, the much-anticipated hero,

02:29.608 --> 02:32.276
returning to rescue
his emotionally unstable maiden!

02:32.402 --> 02:34.445
Unhand her, you jailers of virtue,

02:34.530 --> 02:37.406
or taste the bitter sting
of my vengeance!

02:38.450 --> 02:40.409
The sting of my...

02:43.038 --> 02:44.288
Dr. Marx?

02:44.414 --> 02:47.041
Dr. Marx,
I'm not getting anything from you.

02:47.125 --> 02:51.045
People, we've talked about this.
Acting is reacting.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.631
Victor, you were wooden!
There, I said it.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.591
Mr. Timms? You were good.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.761
Perhaps a little too good.

02:59.263 --> 03:03.057
What's that, Victor? My character's
undefined? That's absurd.

03:03.141 --> 03:08.145
I know who I am.
I'm the guy, the protagonist, the hero.

03:08.272 --> 03:12.233
Every story needs a hero.
I mean, who else is better qualified

03:12.317 --> 03:15.987
to bask in the adulation
of his numerous companions?

03:34.965 --> 03:36.841
The stage is waiting.

03:37.301 --> 03:40.011
The audience thirsts for adventure.

03:42.306 --> 03:43.848
Who am I?

03:44.850 --> 03:46.434
I could be anyone.

03:46.852 --> 03:51.355
I could be the sea cap'n
returning from a mighty voyage

03:51.440 --> 03:53.649
to reclaim his mechanical arm!

03:55.152 --> 03:59.280
Or I could be the rogue anthropologist,
battling pythons down in the Congo!

03:59.364 --> 04:01.115
Down, Chongo, down!

04:01.867 --> 04:04.118
And if you desire romance,

04:05.537 --> 04:08.706
I will become the greatest lover
the world has ever known!

04:15.631 --> 04:19.800
I couldn't help but notice you
noticing me noticing you.

04:19.885 --> 04:23.638
You know, the womens find me
uncomfortably good looking.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.182
But you seem remarkably at ease.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.476
Stop it. No, really.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.978
Well, if you must. What are you doing?

04:31.063 --> 04:33.064
That tickles. Are those real?

04:34.149 --> 04:36.317
That's it! Conflict.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.986
Victor, you were right.
I have been undefined.

04:39.821 --> 04:44.200
People, I've had an epiphany.
The hero cannot exist in a vacuum!

04:44.368 --> 04:47.411
What our story needs is an ironic,
unexpected event

04:47.496 --> 04:50.247
that will propel the hero into conflict!

05:46.805 --> 06:09.410
Mr. Timms?

06:30.098 --> 06:32.099
That's right! You!

06:33.477 --> 06:35.478
Don't be shy. Come on.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.688
It's okay.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.774
That's it, a little closer.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.443
Good.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.737
I won't bite you.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.866
I need a little help here.

06:49.493 --> 06:50.743
Are you okay?

06:51.369 --> 06:53.871
I must get to the other side.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.749
The other side? You mean, just now,
that was you crossing the road?

06:56.833 --> 06:58.125
That's why the...

06:59.294 --> 07:00.544
Why'd you do that?

07:00.629 --> 07:03.756
This is my quest. He waits for me.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.216
What? Who?

07:05.300 --> 07:08.886
The Spirit of the West, amigo. The one.

07:08.970 --> 07:13.349
They say he rides an alabaster carriage
with golden guardians to protect him.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.226
What are you talking about?

07:15.310 --> 07:18.687
Enlightenment.
We are nothing without it.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.399
Nothing? Your delusional quest
just ruined my life!

07:22.484 --> 07:24.944
I had an incredibly complex
social network going!

07:25.028 --> 07:27.905
Highly sophisticated friends!
I was very popular!

07:28.740 --> 07:30.115
Friends? I don't see no friends.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.703
You are a very lonely lizard.

07:35.539 --> 07:38.916
Look, I need water, hydration.
My teeth are chapped.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.168
I need lotion.
I'm down to one layer of skin already.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.003
Pretty soon,
I'm going to start seeing my insides.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.714
Not unlike what you've got going there.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.633
Listen, I can't survive
in the desert, okay?

07:47.717 --> 07:49.635
I... I don't belong here.

07:49.803 --> 07:53.013
That may be true, but here you are.

07:54.224 --> 07:58.561
Now help me up
and I will help you find what you seek.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.146
- You will?
- And perhaps more.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.274
Quickly. I must get back to my quest.

08:03.567 --> 08:07.027
- You mean you've done this before?
- Yes. Many times.

08:07.696 --> 08:10.614
Come, come. That's it, pull my finger.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.700
The Spirit is waiting for me.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.535
Okay, okay.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.251
Okay. That's not going to work.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.295
I must get to the other side.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.881
Why don't you just wait
until there are no cars coming?

08:27.966 --> 08:29.633
It's not so easy as it looks.

08:29.718 --> 08:30.759
What?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.260
Is a metaphor.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.001
There's another one!

09:05.837 --> 09:06.920
I knew it.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.267
You need a little help, amigo?

09:20.352 --> 09:23.437
I think the metaphor broke my spleen.

09:23.521 --> 09:26.106
The path to knowledge
is fraught with consequence.

09:26.191 --> 09:29.026
I'm just looking for the path to water.

09:29.110 --> 09:33.822
If you want to find water,
you must first find Dirt.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.325
Dirt.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.536
Destiny, she is kind to you.

09:39.663 --> 09:42.539
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
The water comes.

09:43.541 --> 09:47.169
At noon, the townspeople gather
for a mysterious ritual.

09:48.380 --> 09:52.132
A town? You mean, with real people
and everything? Where?

09:52.217 --> 09:55.052
A day's journey. Follow your shadow.

09:56.846 --> 10:00.307
You want me to just walk out
into the desert?

10:00.392 --> 10:01.475
That's the way.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.977
Okay. So you're saying

10:04.062 --> 10:07.648
there's a town, a real town,
not a metaphor town.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.233
Go on. It's okay.

10:09.734 --> 10:10.901
Okay.

10:11.569 --> 10:12.986
Well, then, I'm going.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.407
I am leaving the road now!

10:16.991 --> 10:19.993
I'm walking into the desert!

10:20.578 --> 10:21.745
Alone!

10:21.871 --> 10:24.415
We all have our journeys to make!

10:25.083 --> 10:27.751
I will see you on the other side.

10:41.891 --> 10:45.018
Welcome, amigo

10:45.103 --> 10:48.105
To the land without end

10:48.606 --> 10:51.358
The desert and death

10:51.443 --> 10:55.362
Are the closest of friends

10:55.447 --> 10:58.365
We sing of his courage

10:58.450 --> 11:01.702
In magnificent song

11:01.786 --> 11:04.621
But pay close attention

11:04.706 --> 11:07.624
He won't be here long

11:11.921 --> 11:15.048
As the birds pluck his eyes
The sun bleaches his bones

11:15.133 --> 11:20.137
See his entrails get scattered
Watch him lose his cojones

11:26.770 --> 11:29.062
Here in the Mojave Desert,

11:29.147 --> 11:34.401
animals have had millions of years
to adapt to the harsh environment.

11:34.486 --> 11:37.738
But the lizard? He is going to die.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.492
"Four score and seven years ago,
our fathers..."

11:41.576 --> 11:43.660
- Don't move.
- What?

11:49.667 --> 11:51.585
- Don't move!
- Not moving.

11:51.669 --> 11:52.753
Not moving.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.005
Try to blend in.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.673
Blend in? What do you mean?

12:00.470 --> 12:01.678
Blend in.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.514
What are you saying?

12:05.350 --> 12:06.934
- Too late.
- No, no. It's not too late!

12:07.018 --> 12:09.269
I'm blending! I'm a blender!

12:09.521 --> 12:11.480
Hey, calm down! What are you doing?

12:14.567 --> 12:15.901
Stop moving!

12:16.528 --> 12:18.237
Try not to look conspicuous.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.289
- What are you doing?
- I'm blending.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.208
- Go blend somewhere else.
- Don't distract me.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.126
- No room at the inn.
- It's an art, not a science.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.170
- Find your own hiding place.
- No, this is good.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.965
Here she comes! You better run, Mojito!

12:38.049 --> 12:41.844
- What? I thought you said, "Don't move."
- That was before. Now, you run.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.226
Oh, hey. Proboscis.

13:31.895 --> 13:32.936
Testy.

13:45.909 --> 13:49.786
Please, no, please. I have vertigo!
My glands are swelling!

13:51.289 --> 13:52.456
Please, no.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.426
You! I'll kill you! You stupid lizard!

14:04.510 --> 14:06.428
Get out of there.
I'm going to strangle your huevos!

14:06.512 --> 14:08.305
Big bird! Big bird!

14:09.182 --> 14:11.892
No, wait! Come back! I was just kidding!

14:11.976 --> 14:13.894
- Come on, we're friends, right?
- I don't know you!

14:13.978 --> 14:15.771
- Lizards, frogs...
- Find your own hiding place!

14:15.855 --> 14:17.522
- We're practically related!
- No room at the inn!

14:17.607 --> 14:19.024
- Come on, move over!
- You're not my friend!

14:19.108 --> 14:21.234
I'll let you kiss my sister!

14:30.203 --> 14:31.870
You son of a...

15:26.759 --> 15:29.845
Where are your friends now, amigo?

15:58.374 --> 16:01.168
Get your slimy-webbed phalanges
off my boots!

16:02.253 --> 16:03.295
Sorry.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.631
I got a bead on you, stranger.
So you get up real slow

16:06.716 --> 16:08.175
lessen you want to spend the better part

16:08.259 --> 16:10.135
of the afternoon
putting your face back together!

16:10.219 --> 16:12.929
- No, ma'am, I don't.
- Who are you?

16:13.014 --> 16:15.348
- Who am I?
- I'm asking the questions here!

16:15.433 --> 16:17.893
Our town is drying up.
We're in the middle of a drought.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.728
Now someone's dumping water
in the desert!

16:19.812 --> 16:21.938
It's a puzzle of undeterminable size
and dimension,

16:22.023 --> 16:24.858
but I intend to find out
what role you playing in all this.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.569
- Role?
- What are you involved in?

16:27.904 --> 16:30.197
Well, I'm glad you asked.

16:30.281 --> 16:33.408
I've got two one-acts, a mystery
and a musical I've been gestating.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.620
I got the words, I'm just working on
the melody right now. It's like a...

16:38.790 --> 16:40.040
I think it's gonna be a western.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.751
A monkey got a cracker
His mother was a slapper

16:42.835 --> 16:46.463
She'll be coming 'round the mountain
in the rain

16:47.715 --> 16:50.634
You ain't from around here, are you?

16:51.803 --> 16:53.970
I'm still working on it.

16:55.556 --> 16:56.890
So, what's your name?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.518
- Beans.
- That's a funny kind of name.

16:59.602 --> 17:02.562
What can I say?
My daddy plumb loved baked beans.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.396
Well, you're lucky
he didn't plumb love asparagus.

17:04.482 --> 17:05.690
What are you saying?

17:05.775 --> 17:07.858
I mean,
I enjoy a hearty puttanesca myself,

17:07.944 --> 17:10.237
but I'm not sure that a child
would appreciate the moniker.

17:10.320 --> 17:14.950
My daddy was a great man, even if
he did exhibit a proclivity for legumes.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.577
- Spicy.
- You're eating his ashes!

17:18.954 --> 17:20.122
You carry his remains?

17:20.205 --> 17:23.500
No, his ashes. He loved to smoke.
They never found the body.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.585
Well, I'm sure he had his reasons.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.671
- What are you implying?
- Nothing.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.756
My daddy was never near
that mine shaft.

17:29.841 --> 17:31.424
He'd been sober for over a month!

17:31.509 --> 17:34.469
And for you to insinuate that he would
abandon his parental responsibilities

17:34.554 --> 17:38.515
at a delicate time in my personal
development is an affront to my sense...

17:42.186 --> 17:43.562
Miss Beans?

17:44.355 --> 17:46.815
Miss Beans? Hello?

17:48.776 --> 17:49.860
Hello?

18:06.127 --> 18:08.003
And until the people of Andromeda Five

18:08.087 --> 18:11.256
return him safe and sound,
I will not sell my ranch!

18:12.633 --> 18:14.968
- What... What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

18:15.052 --> 18:16.928
- What am I doing?
- You're cuddling me.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.430
- You were frozen.
- I was not.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.432
Yes, you were. You stopped talking.

18:20.516 --> 18:23.810
It's a defense mechanism.
Actually, lots of lizards have it.

18:23.895 --> 18:25.103
You're making that up.

18:25.897 --> 18:28.148
So, you gonna die out here,
or you want a ride into town?

18:28.232 --> 18:32.194
No, no, no. Yeah. No. Yes, please.
Thank you. Sorry.

18:32.278 --> 18:36.031
Today's Wednesday.
Wednesday's when we all get to it.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.241
So who are you, really?

18:38.326 --> 18:40.076
Well, I'm a man of many epithets.

18:40.161 --> 18:42.537
There's my stage name, my pen name,
my avatar.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.165
I had a pseudonym once,
but I had it legally changed.

18:45.249 --> 18:49.252
And so the stranger,
seeking companionship,

18:49.337 --> 18:53.673
finds the woman,
much like the sirens of ancient times

18:53.758 --> 18:58.053
luring him to his certain demise.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.430
...nom de plume, I have a CB handle.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.224
I'm actually one of the few men
with a maiden name.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.976
Whoa! Well, here we are.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.485
Right.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.154
Well, I sure do appreciate this,
Miss Beans,

19:16.239 --> 19:18.990
- and if there's ever anything that I...
- Get on up!

19:19.617 --> 19:21.117
Okay, then!

19:21.619 --> 19:23.620
See you, Beans.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.429
You heading out, Jim?

19:41.514 --> 19:44.641
Well, we gave it our best shot.
We had to sell out.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.602
Can't grow no crops without no water.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.689
Bye, now!

19:55.528 --> 19:56.945
What is it?

20:00.199 --> 20:01.283
What was that for?

20:01.742 --> 20:03.076
You're funny looking.

20:03.494 --> 20:05.829
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're funny looking, too.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.290
- That's a funny-looking shirt.
- That's a funny-looking dress.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.792
- You got funny-looking eyes!
- You got a funny-looking face!

20:11.836 --> 20:15.839
You're a stranger.
Strangers don't last long here.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.341
Here's your beans, Beans.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.468
I'm gonna need some more feed, too,
Willie.

20:20.553 --> 20:24.597
Now, Beans, you owe me three quarts
already. I can't give you more credit.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.975
But I'll have what I owe you at noon.

20:27.059 --> 20:32.314
You don't understand. It's Mr. Merrimack
down at the bank. He cut off all credit.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.607
Hey, Beans! Beans!

20:34.775 --> 20:36.818
You know that there fella?

20:36.902 --> 20:38.445
Hey, Beans! Miss Beans!

20:38.904 --> 20:40.488
Nope.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.781
Hey, Beans!

20:41.991 --> 20:43.033
Hey.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.787
Right. Blend in. Yeah, blend in.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.797
I'd like a glass of water.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.218
He wants a glass of water!

22:25.636 --> 22:27.595
Make it a double!

22:27.680 --> 22:29.055
Give him the spittoon!

22:33.978 --> 22:37.689
Cactus juice. That's what we got.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.256
Hey, there, fruit cup.

23:03.340 --> 23:07.385
You're a long ways from home, ain't ya?

23:07.511 --> 23:10.013
Who exactly are you?

23:14.351 --> 23:15.685
Who am I?

23:17.438 --> 23:18.521
I could be anyone.

23:22.359 --> 23:26.571
What's the matter?
You missing your mommy's mangos?

23:27.698 --> 23:29.866
As a matter of fact, I am.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.869
But not as much as
your daddy's cooking!

23:35.122 --> 23:38.291
Exactly where did you say
you were from?

23:38.375 --> 23:41.711
Me? I'm from the West.

23:41.795 --> 23:45.048
Out there, beyond the horizon.
Past the sunset.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.717
The Far West.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.387
Yeah, that's right, hombres.

23:51.472 --> 23:54.224
The place I come from,
we kill a man before breakfast

23:54.308 --> 23:56.476
just to work up an appetite.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.270
Then we salt him, and we pepper him.

23:59.396 --> 24:03.525
Then we braise him in clarified butter.
And then we eat him.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.652
- You eat him?
- That's what I said!

24:05.736 --> 24:09.864
Hell, I seen things make a grown man
lose control of his glandular functions!

24:09.949 --> 24:13.159
You spend three days in a horse
carcass, living off your own juices.

24:13.244 --> 24:16.120
It'll change a man. Oh, yeah.

24:18.499 --> 24:23.086
Had a few extra aces in this deck,
gents. Just the way I like it.

24:23.420 --> 24:28.091
So, no, my hirsute little rodent friend,
I am not from around these parts.

24:28.175 --> 24:30.510
You might say I'm from everywhere
there's trouble brewing

24:30.594 --> 24:32.887
and hell waiting to be raised.

24:32.972 --> 24:36.432
You might say
I'm what hell's already raised up.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.269
Name's

24:39.979 --> 24:44.274
Rango.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.111
Are you the fella
that killed them Jenkins brothers?

24:49.280 --> 24:51.573
Killed them with one bullet.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.449
Don't get no deader.

24:53.534 --> 24:55.618
All seven of them?

24:56.662 --> 24:58.121
That's right.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.456
All seven of them.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.669
Exactly how you do that, Mr. Rango?

25:07.214 --> 25:09.048
You know, I'm glad you asked me that.

25:09.133 --> 25:13.136
And I will be happy to tell you how.
But you're all gonna have to listen up!

25:14.346 --> 25:16.639
Because this is where it gets

25:17.349 --> 25:19.017
complicated.

25:21.145 --> 25:24.022
That'll close out your account,
Mrs. Oats, two gulps and a swig.

25:24.148 --> 25:27.400
Hands off, Mordecai! That's what's left
of your college education!

25:29.820 --> 25:32.071
I don't rightly have
no other choice, Beans.

25:32.156 --> 25:36.326
Times being so hard,
we just can't give no more credit.

25:36.910 --> 25:39.662
But this here is a bank.
This is where you keep the water.

25:42.833 --> 25:47.170
Beans, you've been like a niece to me
ever since your daddy

25:48.672 --> 25:52.216
did not fall drunk down a mine shaft.

25:52.343 --> 25:56.846
I've tried to protect you and others
from certain realities.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.931
But that... Well...

25:59.516 --> 26:01.225
- Mr. Merrimack?
- Realities are bearing down.

26:01.352 --> 26:02.852
Mr. Merrimack!

26:03.687 --> 26:04.896
Are you all right?

26:05.522 --> 26:09.025
Beans, I need to show you something.

26:16.742 --> 26:20.203
- That's all that's left?
- And this here is the reserve!

26:20.287 --> 26:21.954
I don't know if you've noticed,

26:22.039 --> 26:25.541
but folks just ain't making deposits
on a Wednesday no more!

26:25.626 --> 26:29.087
Mr. Merrimack, if I don't get some water,
I'm gonna lose my ranch

26:29.213 --> 26:31.547
and you're telling me
that's all that's left in the whole town?

26:31.632 --> 26:34.801
Now that just don't make no sense.
Now, listen.

26:34.885 --> 26:38.888
Someone is dumping water
in the desert.

26:39.556 --> 26:42.308
I seen it with my own eyes.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.020
Water in the desert?

26:46.105 --> 26:49.148
Was this during
one of your special times?

26:49.441 --> 26:50.483
No.

26:50.567 --> 26:54.654
Well, we can all dream,
but this is the reality.

26:54.738 --> 26:58.366
Why do you think so many people
are selling out? They just can't make it.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.910
Well, what am I supposed to do?

27:01.328 --> 27:04.038
Well, I suppose
we could talk to the Mayor.

27:04.123 --> 27:07.291
I hear he's been helping people out
in this time of crisis.

27:07.418 --> 27:08.501
The Mayor?

27:08.585 --> 27:11.295
He may be our only hope.

27:11.422 --> 27:14.340
Bullet hits a shovel, ricochets back
towards number three,

27:14.425 --> 27:15.800
and that's when the roof caved in,

27:15.926 --> 27:18.010
igniting the thermos
of pure grain alcohol

27:18.095 --> 27:21.931
instantly vaporizing his bodily form,
leaving nothing but a charcoal statue

27:22.015 --> 27:24.142
and a high-pitched squeal.

27:29.940 --> 27:33.860
Hold on, there. That's only six.
What happened to number seven?

27:35.112 --> 27:36.446
Number seven?

27:36.530 --> 27:38.865
Hell, he died of infection.

27:42.119 --> 27:44.162
- Seven men!
- One bullet!

27:44.288 --> 27:46.289
Drinks all around!

27:49.126 --> 27:51.169
Dance for me, Sod Buster!

27:51.295 --> 27:54.005
- Yes, dance like a chicken!
- That's right! Dance!

27:55.466 --> 27:57.633
You got corn in your ears, mate?

27:57.718 --> 28:00.678
You don't pay the mortgage,
you don't own the land!

28:00.804 --> 28:03.848
- That's basic real estate law, my friend.
- Quid pro quo!

28:03.974 --> 28:07.018
If I see your face in this town again,

28:07.144 --> 28:11.522
I'm gonna slice it off and use it
to wipe my unmentionables.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.399
Mind the beak.

28:14.568 --> 28:17.153
And don't come back!

28:18.989 --> 28:21.699
What are you all gawping at?

28:25.245 --> 28:28.831
Hey, Bad Bill,
there's something I got to tell you!

28:33.420 --> 28:34.712
What is this?

28:34.838 --> 28:38.841
You know who that is, Bill?
That there's Rango!

28:38.926 --> 28:42.762
Yeah, he ain't afraid of you!
He ain't afraid of none of you.

28:42.846 --> 28:44.305
Killed them Jenkins brothers.

28:44.389 --> 28:47.350
- Done it with one bullet, Bill.
- All seven of them!

28:48.018 --> 28:49.894
Is that right?

29:27.599 --> 29:29.892
Let me get that before you...

29:34.314 --> 29:36.065
No. Oh, I know. Here.

29:39.903 --> 29:42.446
Just take care of that for you.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.449
There. All better.

30:09.892 --> 30:12.435
T.O. T.O. Just a second.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.147
All right, now listen!

30:16.273 --> 30:19.483
I'm going to give you fellas
one last chance to reconsider!

30:23.989 --> 30:27.241
And if you don't want to reconsider

30:27.326 --> 30:30.453
I might consider reconsidering myself.

30:41.798 --> 30:45.176
Now that's what I'm talking about. Yeah.

30:45.302 --> 30:46.886
All right, now listen up!

30:46.970 --> 30:50.014
Things are going to be different
around here now that Rango's in town.

30:50.140 --> 30:53.184
Got some new rules!
I want my shoes shined every morning,

30:53.310 --> 30:55.186
my coffee hot, Danish on the side.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.521
Whatever you do,
don't look me in the eye.

30:57.648 --> 31:00.107
Stay out of my peripheral vision!

31:00.359 --> 31:02.151
- It's Rango.
- What's he up to?

31:02.277 --> 31:05.404
He ain't afraid of nobody.
He's telling that bird what's for!

31:05.489 --> 31:07.323
And when you see me coming,
stand aside.

31:07.616 --> 31:10.368
I take large steps and I don't want
none of you hayseeds

31:10.494 --> 31:13.162
getting your bodily fluids on my boots!

31:14.623 --> 31:17.833
Of course, there is no need for violence,

31:17.960 --> 31:20.878
as long as we stick together,
work as a team.

31:21.004 --> 31:24.382
So I want you all to come outside now
and line up single file

31:24.508 --> 31:25.967
while I take a brief intermission!

31:28.845 --> 31:30.638
What's he doing now?

31:30.722 --> 31:32.348
I think it's a number two.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.871
Never mind.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.477
Take a look-see over here!

32:18.562 --> 32:19.812
Well, look at him now!

32:19.896 --> 32:21.772
He's chasing after that hawk!

32:21.898 --> 32:52.887
Give him hell, Rango!

34:17.304 --> 34:20.099
- Did you see that?
- He killed that thing!

34:20.183 --> 34:21.851
What do you think, Doc?

34:22.561 --> 34:25.312
This hawk is dead!

34:25.897 --> 34:28.357
Shoot, I say we cook that right up.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.150
He did it with one bullet!

34:30.235 --> 34:31.777
Just like he said!

34:31.862 --> 34:33.612
It's about time
we had a hero around here.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.989
One who ain't in a pine box.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.493
I think it's time he met the Mayor.

34:39.578 --> 34:42.538
You hear that, Rango?
You're going to meet the Mayor!

34:42.664 --> 34:44.998
Let's hear it for Rango!

34:48.335 --> 34:50.754
And so the stranger basks

34:50.880 --> 34:54.216
in the adulation of his new friends,

34:54.342 --> 34:59.513
sinking deeper into the guacamole
of his own deception.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.265
When is he going to die?

35:01.391 --> 35:03.851
Soon, compadre. Soon.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.411
My land is not for sale!

35:23.580 --> 35:26.081
I came here to save my land, not sell it!

35:26.207 --> 35:29.877
I'm sure there's something reasonable
we can work out if you just talk to him!

35:31.254 --> 35:33.047
Beans! Where are you going? Beans?

35:33.590 --> 35:35.424
The Mayor will see you now.

35:40.889 --> 35:44.141
Water, Mr. Rango, water.

35:44.601 --> 35:47.937
Without it,
there's nothing but dust and decay.

35:48.063 --> 35:52.566
But with water there's life.

35:54.444 --> 35:59.448
Look at them, so desperate to live,
they'll follow it anywhere.

36:00.116 --> 36:02.201
That's the immutable law of the desert.

36:04.120 --> 36:08.332
Control the water
and you control everything.

36:08.583 --> 36:12.920
But I don't have to tell you that being
a true man of the West, as you are.

36:13.171 --> 36:17.424
Oh, yeah. The West is the best.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.760
This is from my private stock.

36:19.844 --> 36:22.972
Vintage rainwater
from the Great Deluge.

36:24.099 --> 36:27.559
Not Noah's deluge.
Good heavens, I'm not that old.

36:30.313 --> 36:32.690
I guess power has its privileges.

36:33.274 --> 36:34.775
You make a good point, son.

36:35.944 --> 36:38.862
But with privilege comes responsibility.

36:40.490 --> 36:43.450
Hell, I was mayor here
before there was a Dirt!

36:43.535 --> 36:46.870
And I may be
just a sentimental old turtle

36:46.997 --> 36:52.001
but I think there's a future for this town.
And I hope you'll be part of it.

36:54.129 --> 36:56.630
- To Dirt!
- To Dirt.

36:59.676 --> 37:03.178
You see them, Mr. Rango?
All my friends and neighbors?

37:04.180 --> 37:07.516
It's a hard life here. Very hard.

37:08.476 --> 37:12.021
Do you know how they make it through
each and every day?

37:12.147 --> 37:13.188
They believe.

37:13.815 --> 37:16.692
They believe it's going to be better.

37:16.818 --> 37:20.154
They believe that the water will come.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.740
They believe against all odds
and all evidence

37:22.866 --> 37:25.034
that tomorrow will be better than today.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.663
People have to believe in something.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.584
Right now, they believe in you.

37:35.837 --> 37:40.049
Pick it up, Mr. Rango.
Your destiny awaits.

37:43.553 --> 37:47.014
People have to believe in something.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.647
It's almost noon. Is everything ready?

37:55.732 --> 37:58.567
Yeah. But he might be a problem.

37:58.651 --> 38:02.071
He's not a problem, William.
He's a solution.

38:05.408 --> 38:06.742
It just don't make no sense.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.410
This whole town is drying up,

38:08.495 --> 38:11.079
and the Mayor is the only one
who don't seem to be affected.

38:11.206 --> 38:13.207
Doesn't that make you
just a wee bit suspicious?

38:13.333 --> 38:16.502
And what about that water
I saw out in the desert?

38:16.586 --> 38:20.923
All right! No need to incite anxiety.
I'll inquire about the Mayor.

38:21.049 --> 38:24.760
But if you really feel
there's some conspiracy occurring,

38:24.844 --> 38:27.888
I suggest you take it up
with the new sheriff.

38:29.182 --> 38:32.226
This is going to be good. Hey!
Watch that needle there.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.269
Not too tight.
I want to leave room for some pucker!

38:34.354 --> 38:35.395
That's good.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.022
Oh, easy there, tiger.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.690
- A little up and back?
- I don't think so.

38:38.775 --> 38:39.817
Have you got French cuffs with that?

38:39.901 --> 38:41.568
Excuse me, Sheriff Rango.
I want to talk to you.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.153
Hey, Beans,
what do you think of the new duds?

38:43.238 --> 38:45.239
I got a 1 0-gallon hat
marked down from 15.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.907
- That's nice.
- Have you met Angelique?

38:46.991 --> 38:48.826
- Hello, Beans.
- Hello, Angelique.

38:48.910 --> 38:49.952
- Tart.
- Floozy.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.246
- Trollop.
- Excuse me, Mr. Rango.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.956
I will blow that ugly right off your face!

38:54.249 --> 38:56.250
I was just thinking that...

38:57.001 --> 38:58.710
You want the old John Hancock,
do you?

38:58.795 --> 39:00.921
- Well, here. Hold this.
- Sheriff Rango, this isn't a social call.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.714
There's a bullet in there.

39:02.799 --> 39:04.341
I know about the shindig this afternoon.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.927
- I ordered myself some right fancy duds.
- Sheriff, I'd like to file a...

39:07.011 --> 39:08.762
- Mr. Rango!
- Oh, you, too? No problem.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.472
- Here, let me just...
- I need you to investigate...

39:10.557 --> 39:13.433
You know, Beans, I bet you clean up
real nice, you put a little effort into it.

39:13.518 --> 39:14.726
- What?
- Now, remember, son,

39:14.811 --> 39:17.354
stay in school, eat your veggies,
burn everything but Shakespeare.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.064
- Who's Shakespeare?
- Sheriff Rango,

39:19.524 --> 39:21.275
if that is your real name.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.569
I am trying to save my daddy's ranch,

39:23.653 --> 39:25.737
which is on the verge
of an agricultural meltdown

39:25.822 --> 39:28.740
while you're playing patty-cake
with this here trollop!

39:30.952 --> 39:34.288
Sad, really. Such a drab little thing.

39:34.956 --> 39:36.123
Why does she do that?

39:36.207 --> 39:39.459
- It's a survival reflex.
- Her switch is just broken.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.003
Well, that's an inconvenience.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.714
It is not a rash! It is a birthmark!

39:45.383 --> 39:46.675
I did it again, didn't I?

39:46.759 --> 39:48.010
Did what?

39:48.386 --> 39:49.970
Let me ask you something.

39:50.054 --> 39:54.141
Did anybody here mention
what happened to our last sheriff?

40:33.473 --> 40:37.851
Pardon, but may I ask you...
Excuse me, may I ask you...

40:37.936 --> 40:41.772
The last sheriff... Pardon me.
Where is everybody going?

40:42.315 --> 40:45.275
What exactly happened to the...

40:49.614 --> 40:51.198
All day

40:51.282 --> 40:55.285
I've faced the barren waste

40:55.787 --> 40:59.665
Without the taste of water

41:03.544 --> 41:07.047
Cool water

41:10.051 --> 41:13.303
Old Dan and I

41:13.388 --> 41:15.389
With throats burned dry

41:15.932 --> 41:20.143
And souls that cry

41:20.228 --> 41:22.813
For water

41:25.900 --> 41:27.192
Cool

41:29.112 --> 41:30.570
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

41:30.655 --> 41:33.115
Clear water

41:41.124 --> 41:42.874
This is a heck of a hoedown
you got going.

41:42.959 --> 41:44.751
Still working out those steps.

41:44.836 --> 41:48.714
So, is this considered
normal civic behavior?

41:48.798 --> 41:51.299
Every Wednesday, just like clockwork.

41:51.384 --> 41:53.135
You kill bird.

41:53.219 --> 41:56.096
Yeah. Matter of fact, I did.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.724
Bird dead. Snake come.

41:58.975 --> 41:59.975
Snake?

42:00.059 --> 42:01.852
He means Rattlesnake Jake, Mr. Rango.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.187
He never comes to town 'cause
he's scared of that hawk.

42:04.272 --> 42:05.564
But he might come now.

42:05.648 --> 42:07.232
Can I have your boots
when you're dead?

42:07.316 --> 42:08.400
No!

42:08.484 --> 42:10.861
And I ain't got no problem
with this Rattlesnake Jake.

42:10.945 --> 42:12.612
That's just what Amos said.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.823
Amos?

42:18.161 --> 42:20.495
You got any gold fillings?

42:38.765 --> 42:41.349
My fellow Dirtonians.

42:41.434 --> 42:46.438
I welcome you to our great day
of deliverance. Hallelujah.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.106
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

42:48.191 --> 42:51.735
Acolytes, prepare the holy spigot!

43:02.330 --> 43:05.665
We have a newcomer
amongst us today, my friends.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.502
A man I think needs
little introduction to you

43:08.586 --> 43:12.756
so bold has been his entry
into our fair society.

43:12.840 --> 43:16.093
Mr. Rango, would you step forward?

43:21.933 --> 43:26.269
The time has come, my friends.
The time that was foretold!

43:26.354 --> 43:28.021
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

43:28.106 --> 43:29.523
The sacred time!

43:29.607 --> 43:31.399
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

43:31.484 --> 43:33.860
The time of destiny!

43:33.945 --> 43:35.529
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

43:35.613 --> 43:38.115
The time of deliverance!

43:38.199 --> 43:39.241
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

43:39.325 --> 43:43.453
It is the time of hydration!

43:58.970 --> 44:01.388
- It's his fault!
- It's the newcomer!

44:01.472 --> 44:03.181
- Burn him!
- He's a witch!

44:03.266 --> 44:04.391
I get his boots!

44:04.475 --> 44:08.728
My friends, my friends!
Temper your frustrations.

44:08.813 --> 44:13.900
Times will be tough from now on.
Sacrifices will have to be made.

44:13.985 --> 44:17.654
But if I can help in any way,
please know that my door is always...

44:17.738 --> 44:19.364
Hold it, hold it!

44:19.448 --> 44:22.242
Now, this whole thing
stinks three ways to Sunday.

44:22.326 --> 44:24.828
First the bank's run dry
and now this here spigot?

44:24.912 --> 44:25.954
The bank's run dry?

44:26.038 --> 44:28.748
- What's she talking about?
- She said there's no water in the bank!

44:34.005 --> 44:37.174
This is all we have!
We can't give it all out!

44:37.258 --> 44:39.467
That was my rehydration account!

44:40.887 --> 44:44.890
None of that civil disobedience
in my town, thank you very much.

44:47.476 --> 44:50.770
Thank goodness you're here, Sheriff.
Things were getting out of hand.

44:50.855 --> 44:52.731
Come right in.

44:52.815 --> 44:56.860
Let me have a gander at the source
of the societal discontentment here.

44:59.655 --> 45:01.072
Mercy.

45:01.157 --> 45:03.867
All right, listen up! I've been thinking

45:03.951 --> 45:06.745
and I believe I've figured something out.

45:06.829 --> 45:09.289
You folks have a water problem!

45:11.292 --> 45:13.919
Now just pay attention, everybody.
I'm trying to make a point here.

45:14.003 --> 45:16.796
Let's say this fella here
were to take a drink of water.

45:16.881 --> 45:19.674
Just one little drink.
No harm, no foul, right?

45:22.845 --> 45:24.012
And you!

45:24.347 --> 45:27.098
You're just as dried up and parched
as a jackrabbit in July.

45:27.183 --> 45:30.268
So you belly on up
and take you a double shot!

45:31.479 --> 45:33.355
Stay with me.

45:34.232 --> 45:38.109
What do you think happens then?
Why we'd all be drinking!

45:38.819 --> 45:41.738
And before you know it,
there wouldn't be any more water.

45:41.822 --> 45:43.823
And then where would we be?

45:45.159 --> 45:46.910
We'd be thirsty.

45:47.453 --> 45:49.162
Real thirsty.

45:49.580 --> 45:52.082
We'd turn on each other
like a bunch of animals!

45:54.710 --> 45:59.589
Now look here.
We have got six days of water.

46:04.595 --> 46:07.305
We have got five days...

46:08.683 --> 46:12.435
As long as we've got water,
we've got ourselves a town.

46:13.646 --> 46:15.563
Sheriff Rango is right.

46:15.648 --> 46:19.276
As long as we have this water,
we have some hope.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.152
And you can all take it from me.

46:21.237 --> 46:24.698
My 100% full-time employment
from this moment on

46:24.782 --> 46:28.743
will be to protect
our precious natural resource.

46:28.828 --> 46:32.664
Ain't no one gonna tango
with the Rango.

46:45.553 --> 46:46.803
Evening, ladies.

46:46.887 --> 46:48.680
Evening, Sheriff.

46:48.764 --> 46:50.890
And don't you come back!

46:50.975 --> 46:54.561
Hold on there, Gordy. You get back
in there and you assert yourself,

46:54.645 --> 46:57.897
and I think you'll find the people of this
here town to be surprisingly hospitable.

46:57.982 --> 46:59.274
Thank you, Sheriff.

46:59.358 --> 47:01.234
What? Not you again!

47:02.695 --> 47:04.487
I stand corrected.

47:10.578 --> 47:13.121
- This ain't the bank.
- I told you, Jedidiah!

47:13.205 --> 47:14.497
Hold it right there!

47:14.582 --> 47:15.874
- Who's that?
- It's the Sheriff!

47:15.958 --> 47:17.625
Get them hands up
where I can see them!

47:18.336 --> 47:20.420
Just as I suspected.

47:20.504 --> 47:23.256
Prospecting without the authorized
equipment. Don't move a muscle.

47:24.050 --> 47:25.550
Prospecting?

47:29.638 --> 47:32.390
Now, you got your shovel,
pickaxe, Benadryl, loofah,

47:32.475 --> 47:35.727
assorted snacks, some puzzle books
and you're gonna need a permit.

47:35.811 --> 47:37.520
- Loofah.
- Ezekiel, Jedidiah!

47:37.605 --> 47:39.856
What the Sam Hill's going on up there?

47:39.940 --> 47:43.526
I've had polyps removed
smarter than the two of you!

47:43.986 --> 47:46.196
Hell's fire, this ain't the bank!

47:46.322 --> 47:49.908
Pappy, the Sheriff is standing right here,
helping us out.

47:49.992 --> 47:52.744
Gonna give us a permit for prospecting.

47:52.828 --> 47:55.413
That's right, sir. Just doing my duty.

47:56.165 --> 47:58.249
The lonely constable on his rounds,

47:58.334 --> 48:00.668
keeping an eagle eye out
for mayhem and malfeasance.

48:01.212 --> 48:03.213
Does he look like he sounds?

48:04.673 --> 48:08.468
Well, Sheriff,
if we was to hit the mother lode,

48:08.552 --> 48:10.678
being prospectors and such,

48:10.763 --> 48:13.932
where would we deposit said annuity?

48:14.016 --> 48:15.975
Here in the town of Dirt,
we happen to have

48:16.060 --> 48:18.895
the finest financial institution
this side of the Missouri.

48:20.648 --> 48:23.233
Protected morning, noon and night
by yours truly.

48:24.985 --> 48:26.986
Much obliged.

48:27.196 --> 48:30.073
The bank's been robbed!
The bank's been robbed!

48:30.157 --> 48:32.617
Good Lord, the bank's been robbed!

48:32.701 --> 48:34.119
What's going on?

48:34.203 --> 48:36.413
- It's gone! The water's all gone!
- What'd he say?

48:36.497 --> 48:37.789
He said the bank's been robbed!

48:38.707 --> 48:41.543
Dr. Marx! I'm on fire! Embrace me!

48:42.169 --> 48:46.798
The bank's been robbed, the town is dry
"We'll die of thirst," the people cry

48:46.882 --> 48:51.428
He promised to protect the vault
The water's gone, it's all his fault

48:52.096 --> 48:54.055
All right, folks, stand back,
clear the area.

48:54.140 --> 48:55.473
This is a crime scene now.

48:55.558 --> 48:58.685
Secure the perimeter, dust for prints,
check for fibers, scan for DNA.

48:58.769 --> 49:01.479
I want a urine sample from everyone.
And get me a latte.

49:01.564 --> 49:02.897
And don't mix up the two.

49:02.982 --> 49:04.149
What's this?

49:04.233 --> 49:05.900
"Prospecting Permit."

49:05.985 --> 49:07.777
I'll take that. Material evidence.

49:07.862 --> 49:09.404
What are we gonna do now, Sheriff?

49:09.488 --> 49:12.198
- We need that water.
- We're all going to die!

49:12.283 --> 49:15.910
My friends, we all know
what we have to do now.

49:15.995 --> 49:19.789
That's right.
We all know what we have to do now.

49:19.874 --> 49:21.916
- And that would be?
- Form a posse.

49:22.001 --> 49:23.877
Form a possum!

49:26.130 --> 49:27.630
A posse.

49:29.049 --> 49:32.135
Now, we're gonna be doing this
in an orderly fashion.

49:32.720 --> 49:37.640
First off, does anybody here know
how to use a firearm of any kind?

49:40.102 --> 49:41.728
All right, then.

49:41.812 --> 49:43.354
What do we do now, Sheriff?

49:43.439 --> 49:46.149
Now we ride!

49:59.121 --> 50:01.539
Where are we going?

50:01.624 --> 50:02.874
What?

50:02.958 --> 50:04.792
Where are we going?

50:12.134 --> 50:15.970
Now, as my deputy, you'll be in charge
of all tracking and finding of villains,

50:16.055 --> 50:18.890
utilizing your well-developed
Injun-uity, no offense taken.

50:18.974 --> 50:20.225
So which way do you think they went?

50:20.309 --> 50:22.894
You want to sniff the air or commune
with a buffalo or something?

50:26.607 --> 50:28.483
Oh, you're good.

50:31.070 --> 50:32.779
I'm depending on you, Spoons.

50:32.863 --> 50:35.532
You got a little tobaccy
in the beard there.

50:35.616 --> 50:38.576
Always good to have a medical man
along, Doc.

50:38.661 --> 50:41.412
Reptiles got to stick together, right,
my brother?

50:41.497 --> 50:42.789
I'm an amphibian.

50:42.873 --> 50:44.415
Ain't no shame in that.

50:47.670 --> 50:50.171
You sure you're
fit for duty there, soldier?

50:52.049 --> 50:53.883
Well, you got a little something
in your eye there.

50:54.635 --> 50:58.429
Oh, that? That there's conjunctivitis, sir.
It's hereditary.

50:59.431 --> 51:02.350
Well, I'm glad to hear
it's not contagious.

51:03.018 --> 51:06.688
Now, just wait a cotton-picking minute!
A posse ain't no place for a...

51:07.439 --> 51:08.773
Never mind.

51:08.857 --> 51:10.817
Hold on there, little sister.

51:10.901 --> 51:13.611
Someone's gonna have
to look after the town while I'm gone.

51:15.447 --> 51:16.864
Can I gut-shoot someone?

51:18.200 --> 51:20.243
Let's put a pin in that.

51:20.744 --> 51:23.705
Sheriff, you're going to bring
that water back, aren't you?

51:24.582 --> 51:26.082
Count on it, little sister.

51:29.169 --> 51:32.380
- Which way do we go, Sheriff?
- There's tunnels everywhere.

51:32.464 --> 51:34.048
Whole town's perforated with them.

51:34.133 --> 51:37.677
She got more holes in her
than a painted lady on a porcupine.

51:37.803 --> 51:40.722
Hey, my daddy took me to her place.

51:41.390 --> 51:43.099
Not what I expected.

51:43.934 --> 51:46.853
How'd them fellers
find the bank, anyway?

51:46.937 --> 51:49.063
Gentlemen, if we can just
stay on task here.

51:49.148 --> 51:51.691
Sheriff! Over here!

51:55.029 --> 51:56.738
- Would you look at that?
- Like seeing the face of God.

51:58.115 --> 51:59.574
Amen, brother.

51:59.658 --> 52:02.535
I remember when it used to flow
every Wednesday.

52:02.619 --> 52:04.620
Those were the halcyon days.

52:04.705 --> 52:06.956
Must be a reason she quit on us.

52:07.249 --> 52:10.793
Whatever the reason,
something is controlling this here water.

52:10.878 --> 52:12.670
What do you say, Sheriff?

52:13.672 --> 52:16.674
Clearly, the robbers came
from this direction.

52:16.759 --> 52:19.177
I say we track this pipe
back to its hydraulic origin

52:19.261 --> 52:21.763
and apprehend the culprits
behind this aquatic conundrum.

52:21.847 --> 52:24.182
- What'd he say?
- I think he said follow the pipe.

52:24.266 --> 52:26.684
- He said follow the pipe.
- He said follow the pipe.

52:31.231 --> 52:33.149
Sure is humid down here.

52:33.233 --> 52:36.277
Yeah, it's activating my piles.

52:36.362 --> 52:38.112
I had a goitre removed once.

52:38.197 --> 52:41.324
Looked like Tony Bennett
stepping out of the shower.

52:41.408 --> 52:44.243
Shoot, I put that on a tortilla.

52:55.506 --> 52:59.842
Whatever you do, do not look down.

53:02.346 --> 53:05.473
- What is this place?
- It's an aquifer.

53:07.351 --> 53:08.851
What's an aquifer?

53:08.936 --> 53:10.937
Well, it's for aqua.

53:11.939 --> 53:13.815
Well, it's empty now.

53:32.709 --> 53:34.669
That's a big one.

53:37.297 --> 53:39.924
- It's the end of the line.
- Don't go no further.

53:40.008 --> 53:43.803
Well, now that there is a pipe.
It's got to be connected to something.

53:43.887 --> 53:46.514
You talk too much.
Why don't you put a cork in it?

53:46.598 --> 53:48.975
Why don't you put a cork...
Tell you where the sun don't shine.

53:49.059 --> 53:50.560
Your mama did.
I'll cook her right up.

53:50.644 --> 53:52.186
You two just don't get it, do you?

53:52.271 --> 53:55.940
Someone or something
is messing with our hydration

53:56.024 --> 53:57.984
and that pipe
has got something to do with it.

53:58.068 --> 53:59.902
I thought
we was following bank robbers!

53:59.987 --> 54:02.280
We're experiencing a paradigm shift.

54:02.364 --> 54:04.991
I'm gonna shift the features on your face
if you don't shut up!

54:05.075 --> 54:06.367
Go ahead and try!

54:08.245 --> 54:11.038
Quiet, you savages! Stop your rattling.
You're affecting my cogitation.

54:13.417 --> 54:16.419
Whoa! I got it. Snuff out them torches.

54:22.176 --> 54:23.217
Sure enough.

54:23.802 --> 54:25.553
Smart thinking there, feller.

54:25.637 --> 54:28.347
- Start climbing.
- Get your foot out of my face!

54:28.432 --> 54:29.974
Not bad, huh, Beans?

54:30.058 --> 54:32.476
You keep thinking like that,
your hat's gonna catch on fire.

54:32.561 --> 54:35.021
Well, you know, you get on a roll,
you just...

54:35.856 --> 54:37.190
Hot, hot! Burn.

54:48.577 --> 54:51.954
Poor things.
All they wanted was a little water.

54:52.039 --> 54:55.499
Cactus dying of thirst. It don't bode well.

54:55.584 --> 54:57.293
- Hey, look what I found!
- What you got there?

54:57.377 --> 55:00.296
- I saw that first!
- Hey, that's mine!

55:00.380 --> 55:01.964
Give me that!

55:02.049 --> 55:04.050
It's empty anyway.

55:04.134 --> 55:05.593
I knew that.

55:05.677 --> 55:06.969
Where'd you find that?

55:07.054 --> 55:09.889
Sheriff! You're going to want to see this!

55:13.560 --> 55:15.269
It's Mr. Merrimack from the bank.

55:15.354 --> 55:16.771
What's he doing here?

55:16.855 --> 55:18.397
- Everybody stand back.
- All right, let me see.

55:18.482 --> 55:20.983
Looks like them varmints shot him
in the back.

55:21.068 --> 55:25.238
No, this man wasn't shot.
He was drowned!

55:25.322 --> 55:27.990
- Drowned?
- In the middle of the desert?

55:28.075 --> 55:29.825
What a way to go.

55:31.495 --> 55:35.248
Well, now, whose boot prints are those?

55:39.086 --> 55:42.546
That's interesting.
The ground's still wet.

55:42.798 --> 55:44.632
I suppose we should bury him.

55:44.716 --> 55:47.301
I don't know. Birds got to eat, too.

55:47.386 --> 55:48.678
Circle of life!

55:48.762 --> 55:49.804
Sheriff.

55:49.888 --> 55:51.430
Will you say a few words?

55:52.808 --> 55:54.725
Yeah. Yeah.

55:57.187 --> 55:58.479
Dearly beloved.

55:58.563 --> 56:03.317
We are gathered here today
to honor this man.

56:03.944 --> 56:05.152
Mr. Merrimack,

56:05.570 --> 56:07.154
you have the right to remain silent.

56:07.364 --> 56:09.573
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

56:09.658 --> 56:10.700
Amen.

56:10.993 --> 56:12.034
- Amen.
- Amen.

56:12.244 --> 56:15.079
Hey! What's that dad-gum Indian doing?

56:19.001 --> 56:21.711
I see you're consulting with the spirits.

56:21.795 --> 56:25.131
No, I'm moulting.
Means I'm ready to mate.

56:26.633 --> 56:28.175
I'll keep that in mind.

56:28.844 --> 56:29.969
Cactus fruit.

56:30.053 --> 56:32.847
Ah, yes. The ancient cactus fruit.

56:32.931 --> 56:34.724
I believe your people use it
as seasoning

56:34.808 --> 56:36.267
when preparing your native dishes.

56:36.351 --> 56:38.185
Also natural laxative.

56:39.855 --> 56:40.938
Pick up trail.

56:41.023 --> 56:44.483
Three men heading west.
One blind, one with

56:46.111 --> 56:48.529
enlarged prostate, riding sidesaddle.

56:48.613 --> 56:51.907
- What did he say?
- They're riding sidesaddle.

56:51.992 --> 56:53.409
- We're whispering.
- What'd he say?

56:53.493 --> 56:54.618
Someone's got a bad valve.

56:54.703 --> 56:57.663
All right, which one of you fellers
needs a check-up?

56:58.623 --> 56:59.749
Awkward.

57:01.084 --> 57:04.378
What exactly are we going to do now?

57:05.005 --> 57:07.381
Now we ride!

57:12.220 --> 57:15.931
That means we're riding now!
This moment.

57:58.934 --> 58:01.352
Marshmallows remind me
of going camping with my daddy.

58:01.436 --> 58:03.604
I could eat them all night long.

58:05.398 --> 58:08.609
Of course he did make me cough them
back up again for breakfast.

58:10.278 --> 58:13.447
This one time,
I coughed up an entire Dalmatian.

58:13.532 --> 58:17.368
That ain't nothing.
I coughed up a whole tribe of pygmies.

58:18.370 --> 58:20.329
They started looking at me weird.

58:20.413 --> 58:23.707
I remember them.
They was quite friendly.

58:23.792 --> 58:27.336
I found a human spinal column
in my fecal matter once.

58:30.423 --> 58:33.008
You might want to get that looked at.

58:34.344 --> 58:36.262
Pass the beans, Beans.

58:36.346 --> 58:38.055
- Sheriff?
- No, thanks.

58:38.140 --> 58:42.560
Mr. Rango? Can you tell us
about the Spirit of the West?

58:43.353 --> 58:46.480
- Yeah, tell us about that.
- Is it true what they say?

58:46.565 --> 58:50.234
Yes, the Spirit of the West!

58:50.318 --> 58:52.736
The eternally unattainable ideal.

58:53.155 --> 58:55.781
They say he rides in
an alabaster carriage

58:55.866 --> 58:57.449
with golden guardians to protect him.

58:58.577 --> 59:01.495
But he only appears to those
who have undertaken an epic quest!

59:02.247 --> 59:03.664
And have made it

59:03.999 --> 59:06.000
to the other side.

59:10.297 --> 59:11.547
The other side of what?

59:12.007 --> 59:13.591
It's a metaphor.

59:13.675 --> 59:14.717
My eye!

59:14.801 --> 59:16.343
That's gonna heal right up.

59:16.428 --> 59:20.431
Sheriff? What are you going to do
about Rattlesnake Jake?

59:20.974 --> 59:22.016
What? Where?

59:23.768 --> 59:27.730
Sorry about that. Word is
you come against him once or twice.

59:28.773 --> 59:30.107
Yeah.

59:30.192 --> 59:32.193
Jake. You mean my brother.

59:32.277 --> 59:34.153
- Your brother?
- That's what I said!

59:34.946 --> 59:37.531
But he's a snake and you're a lizard.

59:37.949 --> 59:40.409
Well, Momma had an active social life.

59:41.828 --> 59:42.953
Did he ever bite you?

59:43.038 --> 59:46.457
Sure enough did. Look at that baby.
Go ahead, you can touch it.

59:46.541 --> 59:50.461
That's interesting.
That there's a belly button.

59:50.587 --> 59:52.129
Luckily, I'm immune to his venom.

59:52.214 --> 59:54.131
Put some in my coffee
just to give it a little tang.

59:54.216 --> 59:56.175
Is it true he's only scared
of them hawks?

59:56.259 --> 59:59.887
Them's what we call
his natural predator.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.808
All this talk of that serpentine devil
is putting my quills on edge!

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:06.894
I ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir.

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:10.147
Don't you all worry about a thing.
Come tomorrow, we'll locate that water

01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:12.233
and return to a hero's welcome.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.903
Friends, before we bunk down

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:18.447
I'd like us all to join hands
for a moment,

01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:21.283
say a few words
to the Spirit of the West.

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:22.993
That's a good idea.

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:28.123
Ain't always spoken rightly to you,
Spirit of the West.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:34.129
But tonight I want to thank you for
bringing Sheriff Rango into our lives.

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:36.799
It's a hard life we got.

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:39.802
Sometimes I don't know how
we're gonna make it.

01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:43.722
But somehow, Sheriff Rango
makes me think we will.

01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:47.601
We needed a brave man
and you sent us one.

01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:51.772
Nice to have someone
to believe in again.

01:00:51.856 --> 01:00:55.484
Thank you, Spirit of the West. Amen.

01:00:56.444 --> 01:00:58.320
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:31.979
Just checking.

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:37.318
- It's a little cold tonight.
- Thank you.

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:42.656
You ever feel like those things
are looking at you?

01:01:42.824 --> 01:01:44.491
That's a Spanish dagger.

01:01:44.617 --> 01:01:47.411
But around here,
we just call them the Walking Cactus.

01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:48.579
Walking?

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:52.583
There's an old legend they actually
walk across the desert to find water.

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:56.420
When I was a little girl, I'd stay up late
watching them, to see if they'd move.

01:01:56.504 --> 01:02:00.591
I thought if I could follow them,
they'd lead me to someplace wonderful.

01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:04.345
Someplace with enough water
for everyone.

01:02:05.263 --> 01:02:09.808
Night after night, I watched them.
I never saw them move.

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:11.810
But you're still watching.

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:14.938
Who doesn't want to find
someplace wonderful?

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:18.692
We'll find the water, Beans.
I promise you.

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:24.490
That's such a lonely sound.

01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:27.284
You ever get lonely?

01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:28.786
Sometimes.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:33.374
I can't imagine it. You're such a charmer
and everyone likes you so much.

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:36.877
- I never made friends easy like that.
- No?

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:40.130
No, we're pretty isolated
out there on the ranch,

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:42.966
sort of like being sealed up
in a little box.

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:46.470
Don't really see a lot of folks.

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:48.806
I wouldn't know what that's like.

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:52.184
There someone special
in your life, Rango?

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:55.646
There used to be.
But she couldn't keep her head.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.731
Besides, my life's too dangerous
for that kind of thing.

01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:00.901
You know, it's an awful solitary
existence out there on the prairie.

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:03.237
Riding the ranges and the suchlike.

01:03:04.989 --> 01:03:09.159
Beans?

01:03:26.261 --> 01:03:30.347
I'm gonna skin you alive, boy! I'm gonna
whup you like a red-headed stepchild!

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:31.765
Choleric varmints, ain't they?

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:34.852
Dysfunctional family. Need intervention.

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:37.396
What's that coming?

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:40.899
It's the water.

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:46.780
I have a plan, and each and every one
of you has a part to play.

01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:48.115
What do I do?

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:50.033
Spoons, you got
the most important job of all.

01:03:50.285 --> 01:03:52.369
You stay up here on the ridge,
and if anything goes wrong,

01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:55.289
you give the signal.

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:09.636
Hey, Beans.
What size dress you wearing?

01:04:09.762 --> 01:04:12.389
- He got it!
- Hallelujah!

01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:14.141
- He found the water!
- You did it, son.

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:15.309
Well, actually...

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:18.228
Why can't you be all brainy
like your brother?

01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:20.731
Pappy, about that water.
There's something I gots to tell you.

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:22.649
Hush up, now. Somebody's coming.

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:28.489
Good sirs, gracious good afternoon
to thee and thee and thee.

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:30.824
May I present Madame Lupone's

01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:33.327
Terpsichorean Troupe
of Traveling Thespians!

01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:37.331
- What is that?
- I think they's thespians.

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:40.501
Thespians?
That's illegal in seven states!

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:44.421
The stage is set. The princess
prepares to take her own life.

01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:46.131
I yearn for love.

01:04:47.091 --> 01:04:49.134
Meanwhile, the lone sentry
stands watch at the castle gate.

01:04:51.179 --> 01:04:52.930
Stands watch at the castle gate...

01:04:54.098 --> 01:04:56.099
Hark! Who goes there?

01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:58.018
This plot is highly predictable.

01:04:58.102 --> 01:04:59.436
Quiet! This is my favorite part.

01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:02.189
Arriving to great fanfare
'twas her aged father,

01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:07.653
strucketh by Cupid.

01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:12.032
Prithee, unhand my fair daughter

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:13.825
and reach for the...

01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:17.996
- Line?
- "Reach for the sky!"

01:05:20.542 --> 01:05:22.125
What was that?

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:24.211
Must be that immersive theater.

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:25.546
We got you surrounded!

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:29.550
You and your entire family get
your hands up where I can see them.

01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:32.052
My entire family?

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:40.978
Grits and spit and collard greens

01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:45.482
Waffle chitlins, monkey brains

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:49.403
Refried bones and booger blood

01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:52.864
Pickled eggs and flaps of mud

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:58.328
It's a full house.

01:05:58.413 --> 01:06:01.707
Looks like we're gonna have ourselves
a good old-fashioned standoff.

01:06:02.584 --> 01:06:06.587
I'll have you know, you're not looking
at our entire contingent.

01:06:13.177 --> 01:06:15.596
What's that supposed to be?

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:17.097
That's the signal.

01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:20.851
That's the signal!
Something must have gone wrong!

01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:28.609
So something's supposed to happen?

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:32.195
I am open to suggestions.

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:41.622
Run!

01:06:47.795 --> 01:06:49.046
Get on the wagon!

01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:57.804
Should we have ourselves
some sport, chill'ens?

01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:00.724
I likes it when they run.

01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:03.810
Maybelle, give the holler!

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:11.735
Looks like we made it!

01:07:11.819 --> 01:07:13.320
That audience was quite responsive.

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:16.281
Yeah, well, I think that
chromosome pool is about dried up.

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:44.935
We got bats!

01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:47.646
Here! You drive.

01:07:55.655 --> 01:07:58.031
Looks like there's gonna be
soup tonight!

01:07:58.491 --> 01:08:00.617
Come on, let's get some!

01:08:09.961 --> 01:08:13.213
What in tarnation?
Don't shoot the water!

01:08:13.339 --> 01:08:16.800
Jedidiah! It's time for
the Alabama squeeze box!

01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:18.343
Okay, Pa!

01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:27.227
I am sensing hostility.

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:28.520
Incoming!

01:08:34.318 --> 01:08:35.569
Hello!

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:36.862
Goodbye!

01:08:46.663 --> 01:08:49.040
Lasso that swine!

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:11.270
I suggest we take evasive action!

01:09:11.354 --> 01:09:13.273
I suggest you shut up and shoot!

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.942
- What happened to the Sheriff?
- He had a previous engagement!

01:09:16.068 --> 01:09:18.737
Boseefus, give them some gumbo now!

01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:28.078
What was that? Go check it out!

01:09:29.372 --> 01:09:31.082
What is it? Is there a problem?

01:09:33.461 --> 01:09:34.920
You could call it that.

01:10:23.344 --> 01:10:24.469
Headache.

01:10:27.139 --> 01:10:29.266
Is that all you got?

01:10:47.159 --> 01:10:49.369
That wasn't altogether unpleasant!

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:52.038
Eat lead!

01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:04.301
Here, hold these.

01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:16.855
Get your hands off me!

01:11:21.903 --> 01:11:23.361
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:33.246
Jump!

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.729
It's impossible.

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:01.066
It can't be. It's empty.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:02.859
There's no water!

01:12:02.944 --> 01:12:06.404
No water?
Then what the hell we been fighting for?

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:10.742
Sir, you have defiled and desecrated
the very sustenance of our livelihood!

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:13.453
I think that there fella in the purty dress
is the Sheriff.

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:16.122
That's the same fellow what give us
a prospecting permit?

01:12:16.248 --> 01:12:19.084
- A what?
- Irrelevant! Obfuscation.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:21.169
You and your kin are under arrest
for bank robbery

01:12:21.295 --> 01:12:23.296
and the murder
of our beloved financial advisor

01:12:23.422 --> 01:12:26.883
Johannes Merrimack the Third,
AKA, Fluffy Joe.

01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:28.551
Sheriff, we didn't kill nobody.

01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:31.012
We done tunneled into that vault,
but there weren't nothing in it.

01:12:31.138 --> 01:12:33.056
Somebody done robbed that bank
before we robbed it.

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.891
Then where'd you get this here jug?

01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:36.977
That's what I been trying
to tell you, Pappy.

01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:38.269
I found it in the desert.

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:41.606
Then why in tarnation
did you bring it here?

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:45.652
Hold on! You're saying this here jug
was empty when you found it?

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:46.987
That's right.

01:12:47.113 --> 01:12:48.405
I don't believe a word of it.

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:50.031
- Let's hang them, Sheriff!
- String them up!

01:12:50.157 --> 01:12:51.616
Who'd dump water in the desert?

01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:53.785
Wouldn't be the first time.

01:12:54.286 --> 01:12:57.038
It's a puzzle!
It's like a big old mammogram!

01:12:57.164 --> 01:12:58.999
What's going on, Sheriff?

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:00.458
I don't know.

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:04.587
But I'm going to strip away this mystery
and expose its private parts.

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:06.965
You and your kin are coming with me.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:12.679
They're coming!

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:14.514
Here they come!

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:18.184
Looks like they got them robbers.

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:42.167
Where's the water?

01:13:45.212 --> 01:13:47.172
There weren't no water.

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.021
Where is he going?

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:06.566
He's going to see the Mayor.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:10.653
He's got to be pleased with that.

01:14:10.738 --> 01:14:12.572
That's a good one, boss!

01:14:22.374 --> 01:14:23.458
That's interesting.

01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:26.419
I do apologise for the shoes, Mr. Rango,

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:29.839
but there's a certain protocol
to this game, you understand.

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:32.258
I'm a bit of a stickler for protocol.

01:14:32.384 --> 01:14:35.303
Well, that's good, 'cause you got
a few questions to answer

01:14:35.429 --> 01:14:37.722
and I've got my own protocol.

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:44.604
But why would anyone dump water
in the blooming desert?

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:48.733
It does seem a bit naive, taking the word
of admitted bank robbers.

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:52.445
Besides, once they hang,
your job is done.

01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:54.030
- Bravo!
- Job well done.

01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:57.075
But what if somebody did rob the bank
before they got there?

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:59.327
And who would do that, Mr. Rango?

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:01.663
I was hoping you could tell me.

01:15:01.789 --> 01:15:04.749
That sounds marginally
near to an accusation.

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.835
Take it any way you like.

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:15.802
Something you said keeps rattling
around in my frontal lobe.

01:15:15.928 --> 01:15:17.095
What's that?

01:15:17.763 --> 01:15:21.474
"Control the water
and you control everything."

01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:24.144
Come now, Mr. Rango.

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:27.147
You attribute divine power to me.

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:30.441
How on earth
could I possibly control the water?

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:36.030
You've obviously mastered this game.

01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:39.576
Well, I've been playing it
for many years, sir.

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:42.829
I was here before the highway split
this great valley.

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:45.582
I watched the march of progress,

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:48.168
and I learned a thing or two.

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:51.838
Perhaps it's time you started
to take the long view,

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:55.800
begin to appreciate
the broad sweep of history.

01:15:56.468 --> 01:15:57.969
Look out there, son.

01:15:58.888 --> 01:16:01.306
You can almost see time passing.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.603
What are you building out here?

01:16:06.687 --> 01:16:10.023
The future, Mr. Rango, the future.

01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:13.818
One day soon,
all this is going to fade into myth,

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:16.738
the frontier town, the lawman,
the gunslinger.

01:16:16.864 --> 01:16:19.240
There's just no place
for them any more.

01:16:19.366 --> 01:16:22.660
- We're civilized now.
- That's right, civilized.

01:16:23.495 --> 01:16:25.079
That's what the future holds.

01:16:25.206 --> 01:16:28.541
You can either be part of it,
or you can be left behind.

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:32.795
Is that what happened to
Mr. Merrimack? Did he get left behind?

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.550
Careful, Mr. Rango. You seem to forget
you're just one little lizard.

01:16:37.885 --> 01:16:41.721
You seem to forget
I'm the law around these parts.

01:16:44.391 --> 01:16:47.477
Our new sheriff has been
playing the hero for so long,

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:49.979
he's actually starting to believe it.

01:16:50.064 --> 01:16:52.523
Call in Rattlesnake Jake.

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:55.276
But Jake's the Grim Reaper.

01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:57.737
He never leaves
without taking a blooming soul.

01:16:57.863 --> 01:16:59.072
Do it!

01:17:13.587 --> 01:17:17.799
Now be still. You gotta look
presentable to meet your maker.

01:17:23.597 --> 01:17:26.975
Death has arrived

01:17:31.438 --> 01:17:35.817
How will the hero survive?

01:17:39.613 --> 01:17:42.740
The Mayor has bought up
all the land in the valley,

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:44.701
except for your ranch, Miss Beans.

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:48.621
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:51.541
Unless he controls the water.

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:53.501
Like a monkey's bladder!

01:17:53.627 --> 01:17:55.878
Then he could bring it back
once he's bought up all the land.

01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:58.089
But how does he control the water?

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:02.552
Well, you gotta spend some time
and train them.

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:05.763
'Cause you know monkeys, when
they do go, you rub their nose in it.

01:18:05.973 --> 01:18:07.974
Sheriff, we got a problem.

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:18.109
Hold on, Beans.
That won't be necessary.

01:18:21.655 --> 01:18:24.866
- Hang him till his head turns blue!
- Give us them robbers!

01:18:24.992 --> 01:18:27.410
Hold on! Calm down, everyone!
Let me talk!

01:18:27.494 --> 01:18:29.787
- Nail them to the courthouse!
- Now, calm down, everybody.

01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:32.540
Get them out here
so we can cut off their giblets!

01:18:33.167 --> 01:18:34.751
You, too, Spoons?

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:38.212
They done taken that water.
They taken everything we got!

01:18:38.338 --> 01:18:41.299
No one's stringing anyone up.
Not while I'm sheriff.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:42.633
But this is all his fault!

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:45.094
You said you's gonna
bring the water back.

01:18:45.179 --> 01:18:47.722
It's just, we got no hope
without that water.

01:18:47.848 --> 01:18:49.724
We got nothing left to believe in.

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:51.976
You see that sign up there?

01:18:52.686 --> 01:18:54.896
As long as that sign says "Sheriff,"

01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:57.356
you can believe that there's
law and order in this town.

01:18:57.483 --> 01:19:01.527
But without law and order,
ruminate on that. Oh, yeah.

01:19:01.653 --> 01:19:04.822
Starts out slow, like a fungus.

01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:07.575
Somebody says a cross word.
Accusations start flying.

01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:10.495
Neighbor turns on neighbor.
Pretty soon, we're eating our children!

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:11.996
And then dogs and cats
are getting together

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:14.749
to create all sorts of unnatural
mutant aberrations!

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:19.378
So, you want something
to believe in, Spoons?

01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:21.047
Believe in me.

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.592
Believe in that there sign.

01:19:25.552 --> 01:19:29.055
For as long as it hangs there,
we got hope.

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:56.916
Hello, brother.

01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:59.085
Thirsty?

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:14.308
Long time, brother.
How you been keeping?

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:16.477
Well, you know...

01:20:18.939 --> 01:20:23.234
I hear you been telling about how
you killed all them Jenkins brothers.

01:20:23.318 --> 01:20:25.987
With one bullet, wasn't it?

01:20:26.113 --> 01:20:27.989
Isn't that right?

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:32.326
All these good folks here
believe your little stories, don't they?

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:36.247
Why, they believe you're just
a stone killer, don't they?

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:39.584
Seems these folks trust you.

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:42.753
They think you're gonna save
their little town.

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:46.340
They think you're gonna save
their little souls!

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:53.931
But we know better, don't we?

01:20:59.479 --> 01:21:03.107
So why don't you show your friends here
what you're made of?

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:06.027
Show them who you really are.

01:21:06.153 --> 01:21:09.155
Why don't you just pull your gun
and shoot me?

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:12.158
But, of course, you won't need all these.

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:14.202
Just one, right?

01:21:16.496 --> 01:21:19.957
Go ahead, hero. Pull the trigger.

01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:25.379
You got killer in your eyes, son?

01:21:27.674 --> 01:21:28.841
I don't see it.

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:35.348
You didn't do any of them things
you said, did you?

01:21:35.474 --> 01:21:39.477
You didn't kill them Jenkins brothers.
You ain't even from the West!

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:40.728
Are you?

01:21:41.521 --> 01:21:44.148
- Say it!
- No.

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:48.361
Speak up.
I don't think your friends here heard you.

01:21:49.988 --> 01:21:51.030
No.

01:21:51.156 --> 01:21:53.658
All you've done is lie
to these good people.

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:57.995
You ain't nothing but a fake
and a coward. Isn't that right?

01:21:58.247 --> 01:21:59.413
Yes.

01:21:59.539 --> 01:22:01.249
- Louder!
- Yes.

01:22:05.712 --> 01:22:08.881
Listen close, you pathetic fraud.

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:12.009
This is my town now.

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:16.555
If I ever see you again, I will take
your soul straight down to hell!

01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:35.074
Who are you?

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:33.192
Who am I?

01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:37.071
I'm nobody.

01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:33.270
Golden guardians.

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:36.815
The alabaster carriage.

01:26:41.821 --> 01:26:44.323
The Spirit of the West.

01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:52.665
Excuse me? Mister Spirit, sir?

01:26:55.168 --> 01:27:00.172
There's a beaut. Sometimes you got to
dig deep to find what you're looking for.

01:27:01.841 --> 01:27:03.217
So you made it.

01:27:04.177 --> 01:27:05.427
Is this heaven?

01:27:05.512 --> 01:27:09.348
If it were, we'd be eating Pop-Tarts
with Kim Novak.

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:10.808
Yeah.

01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:14.144
No kidding.
What are you doing out here?

01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:16.522
Searching, same as you.

01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:20.776
I don't even know
what I'm looking for any more.

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:22.820
I don't even know who I am.

01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:25.864
They used to call you
the Man with No Name.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:31.120
These days they got a name
for just about everything.

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:35.499
Doesn't matter what they call you.
It's the deeds make the man.

01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:39.378
Yeah, but my deeds just made things
worse. I'm a fraud. I'm a phony!

01:27:39.504 --> 01:27:43.382
My friends believed in me,
but they need some kind of hero.

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:45.175
Then be a hero.

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:49.179
No. No, no, you don't understand.
I'm not even supposed to be here.

01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:53.517
That's right. You came a long way
to find something that isn't out here.

01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:57.271
Don't you see? It's not about you.

01:27:58.273 --> 01:27:59.857
It's about them.

01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:04.194
But I can't go back.

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:06.697
Don't know that you got a choice, son.

01:28:10.535 --> 01:28:13.287
No man can walk out on his own story.

01:28:25.759 --> 01:28:27.468
So you made it.

01:28:28.887 --> 01:28:32.765
That's right, amigo.
The other side of the road.

01:28:35.226 --> 01:28:37.478
Did you just see that?

01:28:37.896 --> 01:28:40.773
We each see what we need to see.

01:28:41.775 --> 01:28:43.776
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:28:55.789 --> 01:28:56.914
Yeah.

01:28:57.999 --> 01:28:59.416
It is.

01:28:59.959 --> 01:29:03.796
Come, my friend.
I want to show you something.

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:12.096
Many years ago,
this entire valley was covered in agua.

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:16.141
Now only one question remains.

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:18.936
Where did it go?

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:55.973
They follow the water.

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:59.184
They follow the water! Come on!

01:30:34.053 --> 01:30:38.682
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.

01:30:39.392 --> 01:30:41.351
What are you building out here?

01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:43.353
The future, Mr. Rango.

01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:48.025
You can either be part of it,
or you can be left behind.

01:30:50.403 --> 01:30:53.280
I was here before the highway split
this great valley.

01:30:56.367 --> 01:30:58.952
I watched the march of progress

01:30:59.078 --> 01:31:01.330
and I learned a thing or two.

01:31:06.628 --> 01:31:08.796
Control the water

01:31:08.922 --> 01:31:11.298
and you control everything.

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:20.390
Come now, Mr. Rango.

01:31:20.475 --> 01:31:22.309
You attribute divine power to me.

01:31:22.435 --> 01:31:24.978
How on earth
could I possibly control the water?

01:32:01.891 --> 01:32:03.892
What now, amigo?

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:14.570
No man can walk out on his own story.

01:32:16.155 --> 01:32:17.573
I'm going back.

01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:20.409
But why?

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:23.537
Because that's who I am.

01:32:35.675 --> 01:32:40.345
You got a lot of nerve showing up here,
lawman. What is it you want?

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:45.058
Your pappy and them boys are about
to hang for something they didn't do.

01:32:46.519 --> 01:32:48.186
But I've got a plan.

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:19.092
I appreciate how difficult
this is for you, Beans.

01:33:19.218 --> 01:33:22.179
But you're making a practical decision.

01:33:22.263 --> 01:33:25.015
Decisions, decisions.

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:28.268
There's no need for any more suffering.

01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:38.278
Your family's ranch is nothing
but a wasteland now.

01:33:38.821 --> 01:33:43.575
Sign the deed and relieve yourself
of your father's burden.

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:48.455
My daddy was not a burden!

01:33:48.581 --> 01:33:50.958
Keep your blood money
and I'll keep my land!

01:33:57.090 --> 01:34:00.258
Do what he says or,
by all the fires of the black pit,

01:34:00.343 --> 01:34:03.762
I'll squeeze them pretty brown eyes
out of your skull!

01:34:04.514 --> 01:34:06.723
Now, hold on, Jake.
There's no need to...

01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:09.142
Let me do my job! You brought me in.

01:34:09.268 --> 01:34:11.812
Now we're gonna play this thing
out to the end!

01:34:12.605 --> 01:34:15.107
Sign the damn paper, woman!

01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:17.109
Go to hell!

01:34:17.276 --> 01:34:19.611
Where do you think I come from?

01:34:20.196 --> 01:34:22.531
Look into my eyes.

01:34:22.615 --> 01:34:24.992
I want to see you die.

01:34:30.123 --> 01:34:31.331
Jake!

01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:36.670
I'm calling you out!

01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:40.465
Jake!

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:45.178
This day
just got a little more interesting.

01:35:12.415 --> 01:35:13.623
Put her down.

01:35:13.708 --> 01:35:17.335
Or what, little man?
You going to kill me?

01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:19.337
That's just about the size of it.

01:35:22.008 --> 01:35:24.634
- Get your filthy paws off me!
- Shut your gob!

01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:27.888
All right, Sheriff, make your move.

01:37:00.148 --> 01:37:01.648
Now amigos!

01:37:06.195 --> 01:37:08.864
- Heave! Heave!
- Heave! Heave!

01:37:26.799 --> 01:37:29.050
That was a bad idea.

01:37:33.472 --> 01:37:34.514
Thirsty, brother?

01:37:38.227 --> 01:37:40.353
Here it comes!

01:37:42.148 --> 01:37:43.190
No. No!

01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:48.820
It's a miracle!

01:37:48.988 --> 01:37:50.363
Look out!

01:37:57.496 --> 01:37:59.164
- Lookee there!
- What is that?

01:38:01.083 --> 01:38:02.500
It's our salvation, Pa!

01:38:02.585 --> 01:38:05.712
It's a jailbreak, boys! We're busting out!

01:38:15.932 --> 01:38:20.018
I'm gonna blow so many holes in you,
your guts'll be leaking lead!

01:38:20.102 --> 01:38:22.854
Well, then
it's a good thing I brought some backup.

01:38:34.116 --> 01:38:35.200
What?

01:38:38.955 --> 01:38:40.830
Ain't no hawk.

01:38:40.915 --> 01:38:43.375
Ain't nothing but bats!

01:38:45.544 --> 01:38:49.798
Stick to the plan, boys!
Let's bleed that devil dry!

01:39:01.227 --> 01:39:03.395
It only takes one bullet.

01:39:03.479 --> 01:39:05.605
You ain't got the nerve.

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:08.233
Try me.

01:39:12.571 --> 01:39:14.239
Oh, Mr. Rango.

01:39:14.907 --> 01:39:16.574
Aren't you forgetting something?

01:39:21.831 --> 01:39:23.790
Hand me your gun, Sheriff.

01:39:26.669 --> 01:39:28.461
Now, Mr. Rango.

01:39:40.599 --> 01:39:42.934
Beans! Hold on.
Don't worry, I got a plan.

01:39:43.853 --> 01:39:45.979
Help!

01:39:46.105 --> 01:39:48.440
Open the door!

01:39:49.025 --> 01:39:50.525
Okay, plan B.

01:39:51.694 --> 01:39:52.819
Beans, you're mumbling.

01:39:53.362 --> 01:39:57.532
All my problems taken care of
except for one.

01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:59.326
It's a new West, Jake.

01:39:59.452 --> 01:40:03.788
There's no room for gunslingers
any more. We're businessmen now.

01:40:03.873 --> 01:40:05.623
Yeah, we got new hats.

01:40:05.708 --> 01:40:09.336
Where I come from,
we call this improvisation.

01:40:10.713 --> 01:40:12.464
You came back.

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:21.890
What was that?

01:40:21.974 --> 01:40:24.559
No need to panic,
but I think you just swallowed plan B.

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:25.810
What?

01:40:27.396 --> 01:40:28.938
Okay, panic time.

01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:31.983
You and the Sheriff are more alike
than you think.

01:40:32.068 --> 01:40:33.902
You're nothing but legends.

01:40:33.986 --> 01:40:37.739
Pretty soon,
no one will believe you even existed.

01:40:40.993 --> 01:40:43.578
One last bullet to kill one last outlaw.

01:40:45.915 --> 01:40:47.665
How fitting.

01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:24.077
Sheriff, I'm sure if we work together,

01:41:24.203 --> 01:41:28.331
we can reach a mutually beneficial
solution to our current situation.

01:41:28.416 --> 01:41:30.708
You better take it up with him.

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:43.721
One bullet.

01:41:45.099 --> 01:41:47.434
I tip my hat to you,

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:50.437
one legend to another.

01:41:52.273 --> 01:41:54.482
What was that you said?

01:41:54.567 --> 01:41:59.279
"Pretty soon,
no one will believe you even existed."

01:41:59.447 --> 01:42:01.573
No, Jake! No!

01:42:13.919 --> 01:42:15.295
Rango!

01:42:16.755 --> 01:42:20.550
You brought the water back,
just like you promised.

01:42:20.634 --> 01:42:22.302
You really are a hero.

01:42:23.596 --> 01:42:26.764
Well, the thing about heroes is,
whenever you...

01:42:26.849 --> 01:42:28.641
Don't spoil it.

01:42:28.767 --> 01:42:29.976
Right.

01:42:30.478 --> 01:42:33.771
Well, I don't know about you all,
but I could sure go for a dip.

01:42:37.276 --> 01:42:40.195
And so the lizard completes his journey

01:42:40.279 --> 01:42:44.324
from humble beginnings
to the legend we sing of today.

01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:49.120
And although he is certain to die,
perhaps from a household accident,

01:42:49.205 --> 01:42:52.248
which account
for 65% of all unnatural deaths,

01:42:52.333 --> 01:42:55.793
the people of the village
will honor his memory

01:42:55.961 --> 01:42:59.130
even as they abandon their dignity.

01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:09.057
- I'm going in.
- How about a cold one, there?

01:43:09.141 --> 01:43:11.184
Water ain't money. Money is money.

01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:13.895
- Well, I ain't got no...
- We're talking hard cash.

01:43:14.521 --> 01:43:15.772
We have a problem.

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:18.524
Who let Snuggles in the pool again?

01:43:18.651 --> 01:43:21.069
I really think you complete me.

01:43:21.153 --> 01:43:23.363
Prithee, unhand my fair maiden.

01:43:23.489 --> 01:43:26.574
- Cut. Cut. Everybody, take five.
- How can you keep missing your mark?

01:43:26.659 --> 01:43:27.700
What's my motivation?

01:43:29.536 --> 01:43:31.037
Oh, you kids.

01:43:31.163 --> 01:43:32.997
What did you do that for?

01:43:33.082 --> 01:43:35.541
I was just checking.
I hear if you get too sunburnt,

01:43:35.668 --> 01:43:37.418
you can peel a man's face right off.

01:43:37.503 --> 01:43:39.087
- What is it?
- That there's some human spleen.

01:43:39.171 --> 01:43:40.255
Don't touch it.

01:43:40.339 --> 01:43:41.923
That's the second time
that's happened to me.

01:43:42.007 --> 01:43:43.591
This water thing's great.

01:43:43.676 --> 01:43:45.176
I'm urinating right now.

01:43:45.261 --> 01:43:48.388
Adult swim, next five minutes.

01:43:48.514 --> 01:43:50.848
Stay between the buoys.

01:43:50.933 --> 01:43:52.267
I packed your lunch. Danish is in there

01:43:52.351 --> 01:43:54.060
and I picked the raisins out
just the way you like it.

01:43:54.186 --> 01:43:56.187
Don't forget, your nasal spray is
in your saddle-bag...

01:43:56.272 --> 01:43:57.897
- Beans!
- ...and your moisturizing lotion...

01:43:58.023 --> 01:44:00.233
- Now, Beans! We've talked about this.
- Lotion?

01:44:00.359 --> 01:44:03.069
That's for my gun. That's gun lotion.

01:44:03.237 --> 01:44:04.779
Sheriff, where are you headed?

01:44:04.863 --> 01:44:07.782
There's trouble down a dry creek.
Bad Bill's been acting up again.

01:44:07.866 --> 01:44:09.742
Now, honey, you come back
with all your digits.

01:44:09.868 --> 01:44:11.202
And don't go trying to be a hero.

01:44:11.287 --> 01:44:12.745
Beans, you are missing the point.

01:44:12.871 --> 01:44:15.206
I got an image to protect now.

01:44:16.292 --> 01:44:17.875
Where's my Tic Tacs?

01:44:19.211 --> 01:44:21.129
- I found them.
- What's going on?

01:44:21.213 --> 01:44:24.132
Well, in order to satisfy the needs
of the collective,

01:44:24.216 --> 01:44:26.009
the hero must abandon the self

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:30.054
and solidify his image as an icon
that will forever be remembered.

01:44:30.889 --> 01:44:33.266
So, this is the sunset shot.

01:44:41.734 --> 01:44:43.776
Give them a good one, amigo.

01:44:53.245 --> 01:44:54.787
Ready, Excelsior?

01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:57.040
My fellow comrades.

01:44:57.124 --> 01:44:59.792
There will be times
when you doubt yourself.

01:44:59.877 --> 01:45:03.087
When you feel pummeled
by the cataclysms of life,

01:45:03.505 --> 01:45:07.050
remember this moment.
Remember me.

01:45:07.593 --> 01:45:10.386
Know that I will be there watching you,

01:45:10.596 --> 01:45:13.431
sometimes at inappropriate moments.

01:45:13.724 --> 01:45:16.059
That's part of the deal.

01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:19.604
And remember, within all of us resides

01:45:19.938 --> 01:45:22.690
the true Spirit of the...

01:45:25.611 --> 01:45:27.904
Let's take it from the top.
