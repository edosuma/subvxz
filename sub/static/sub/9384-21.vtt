WEBVTT

00:02.586 --> 00:04.963
ANNOUNCER: We now return to
Little House on the Prairie.

00:06.423 --> 00:09.384
That's wonderful, Mary.
You're doing great with your Braille.

00:09.468 --> 00:11.553
I couldn't have done it without you, Pa.

00:11.637 --> 00:14.223
Why don't you go up to bed
and get some sleep, honey?

00:21.021 --> 00:24.191
Honey, you remember
where the stool was.

00:27.653 --> 00:31.615
Mary, you're in the kitchen,
sweetheart, you're all disoriented.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.867
Let me help you. The ladder's right here.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.118
Thanks, Pa.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.581
[Crashing]

00:39.665 --> 00:40.666
[Laughing]

00:41.875 --> 00:44.253
Jeez, life was a lot tougher back then.

00:45.003 --> 00:48.090
LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

00:48.173 --> 00:51.385
"is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:51.468 --> 00:54.638
"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

00:55.430 --> 00:57.891
"on which we used to rely?

00:58.475 --> 01:00.394
"Lucky there's a family guy

01:01.603 --> 01:04.940
"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

01:05.023 --> 01:06.775
"all the things that make us"

01:06.859 --> 01:08.360
"laugh 'n' cry"

01:08.443 --> 01:12.197
"He's a family guy"

01:15.200 --> 01:18.161
Listen up, everybody.
It's time for spring cleaning.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.706
ALL: Spring cleaning? Oh, not again.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.332
That was weird.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.042
Boy, that was weird, too.

01:24.126 --> 01:26.712
If we all pitch in,
we'll be done in no time.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.047
Lois, you know I swore
I'd never clean again.

01:29.131 --> 01:31.300
Not after Bounty
dropped me as their spokesman.

01:31.884 --> 01:32.885
Wait a second.

01:32.968 --> 01:36.513
Rosie, I've just poured this glass of
warm yellow liquid on the counter...

01:36.597 --> 01:39.725
...and you're telling me that Bounty
can pick it up in five seconds?

01:39.808 --> 01:41.268
-What is this?
-Four seconds.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.477
-Is that--
-Three seconds.

01:42.561 --> 01:44.021
-It smells like--
-Clean my pee!

01:44.354 --> 01:47.232
Mom, I can't clean. I got stuff to do.

01:47.316 --> 01:50.194
Sweetheart, we all know
you don't have any stuff to do.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.030
Now, I don't want to hear
any more excuses from anyone.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.699
ALL: Crap! We did it again!

01:58.035 --> 01:59.328
ALL: Ruth Bader Ginsburg!

02:00.037 --> 02:01.121
[Oohing]

02:06.168 --> 02:09.004
Look, Meg, it's your little baby booties.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.883
And your little bronze hat.
And your tail.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.468
MEG: My what?
LOIS: Nothing.

02:14.635 --> 02:18.764
Okay, Lois' list says clean the windows,
clear the gutters, and wash the siding.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.058
To most folks, that's three chores.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.561
To Peter Griffin and his big hose,
it's one.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.981
You're not working hard, Peter,
you're working smart.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.733
Hey, Chris, give me the juice!

02:40.077 --> 02:44.456
Peter, there's water and glass!
It's a disaster in here!

02:44.540 --> 02:46.917
Well, why don't you
put down your ginger ale...

02:47.000 --> 02:48.710
...and Redbook and get to work?

02:48.877 --> 02:50.254
Lazy.

02:50.337 --> 02:53.006
You're not helping!
Look, don't come near the house!

02:53.090 --> 02:54.424
Go do something else.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.303
JOE: This duffel bag is only half-zipped.
PETER: Where are you going?

02:58.387 --> 03:02.140
I'm going camping for the weekend
with Johnny-Cut-Corners.

03:02.224 --> 03:04.101
You guys want to come along?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.562
It would be nice to get out of the house.

03:06.645 --> 03:10.691
This is the time of the month when
Loretta is visited by her Aunt Flo.

03:11.108 --> 03:15.153
Loretta likes to personify
her menses in humorous ways.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.614
JOE: Hey, Quagmire!
You up for some camping?

03:17.698 --> 03:21.493
Sorry, bud, the only tent
I'm pitching this weekend is....

03:22.160 --> 03:24.288
Well, you see where I'm going with this.

03:25.163 --> 03:28.083
I want to go, Dad.
It'll get me away from the evil monkey...

03:28.166 --> 03:29.626
...that lives in my closet.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.503
Monkey in the closet.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.887
This is gonna be great.

03:39.970 --> 03:43.724
Last time I did male bonding was when
me and Cleveland went to Chinatown.

03:45.684 --> 03:49.062
Look, forget how it happened.
Can you just get us out of this?

03:57.154 --> 03:59.698
I say, Rupert, this paste is
quite delicious.

04:00.032 --> 04:02.159
It's almost worth the bowel obstruction.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.539
Are those my books?
What the hell are you doing?

04:07.623 --> 04:11.668
Papier-mâché. I used them to make
the houseboat from Surfside 6.

04:11.835 --> 04:12.836
You remember.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.048
STEWIE: [Singing]
"Surfside 6, who lives there?

04:16.131 --> 04:19.051
"Surfside 6, young bachelors

04:19.218 --> 04:20.969
"In Miami Beach"

04:21.053 --> 04:23.305
Those are my first editions,
you little punk!

04:23.680 --> 04:25.599
Mama, doggy scary!

04:25.682 --> 04:28.769
Brian, have you lost your mind?
He's just a baby.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.772
-He doesn't know what he's doing.
-This isn't over!

04:31.939 --> 04:36.109
If you're looking for your Dostoyevsky,
I used it to make the fort from F Troop.

04:36.193 --> 04:39.154
Look what I found, Stewie.
An appointment card.

04:39.238 --> 04:40.656
You've got a checkup.

04:40.739 --> 04:43.617
Marvelous. A quick weigh-in,
a "stick out your tongue"...

04:43.700 --> 04:47.204
...and a nice lollipop to cap it all off.
Remind me to ask the doctor...

04:47.287 --> 04:48.997
...when my other testicle will descend.

04:54.670 --> 04:59.049
Bang! I'm Daniel Boone! I'm a man!
I'm a big man! Bang! Bang!

05:00.133 --> 05:03.887
Now I'm Pat Boone. Gonna have
a Christmas special with Andy Williams.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.850
So beautiful.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.603
It's almost as if this world
was created especially for me.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.608
-Do you think he's onto us, Christof?
-No, he's an idiot.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.612
Dad, I dug the latrine 50 feet out.

05:20.696 --> 05:23.699
That's great. You want a cookie
every time you do something right?

05:23.782 --> 05:25.784
-Go get some firewood!
-Yes, sir!

05:26.410 --> 05:28.370
He's gonna grow up to be quite a man!

05:29.496 --> 05:31.582
That was incredible, Kevin.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.001
I'm not here to impress you. Am I, Dad?

05:34.084 --> 05:35.878
Did I say you could rest yet?

05:36.336 --> 05:38.589
I'm Abe Lincoln!
I just chopped some wood!

05:39.256 --> 05:40.382
Good for you, son.

05:40.632 --> 05:44.386
Where's Chris? I asked him
to fill up the canteens an hour ago.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.470
CHRIS: Hey, Dad, look.

05:45.804 --> 05:49.474
I covered my back with honey,
and now the ants are taking me home.

05:50.184 --> 05:53.187
He does the same thing at home
with Velveeta and cockroaches.

05:53.270 --> 05:56.398
If you turn the light on fast,
they slam him into the fridge.

06:01.737 --> 06:02.988
Great, Mirabella.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.657
December's Mirabella.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.453
What's your story?
Get lost on the way to the morgue?

06:09.536 --> 06:12.497
No, seriously, is that yours?
Because if it is, bravo.

06:12.915 --> 06:16.084
You remember
that short-lived sitcom, Fish?

06:16.168 --> 06:18.587
They should've put that on before CHiPs.

06:18.670 --> 06:21.131
The marketing practically writes itself.

06:21.215 --> 06:24.218
JOE: Let's go, Chris,
your dinner isn't gonna catch itself.

06:24.301 --> 06:27.888
I don't want to go.
I had a bad experience with a fish once.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.562
Oh, my God! My fish is gone!

06:36.313 --> 06:37.814
And he robbed me!

06:38.190 --> 06:39.483
Okay, see you, Chris.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.610
Peter, this is none of my business,

06:41.693 --> 06:43.654
but you're turning your
boy into a slacker.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.532
How dare you
call my parenting into question.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.784
If you were a woman, I'd slug you.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.537
I'm just saying
you should teach him some responsibility.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.747
All right, I'll show you responsibility.

06:53.830 --> 06:57.543
Hey, Chris, you are responsible
for guarding the camp while we're fishing.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.920
You got it, Dad. You can count on me....

07:00.003 --> 07:01.296
[Snoring]

07:01.463 --> 07:03.549
Chris, pay attention. I want you to....

07:03.632 --> 07:04.758
[Snoring]

07:04.883 --> 07:06.718
All right, take a deep breath, Stewie.

07:06.802 --> 07:07.803
[Giggling]

07:07.886 --> 07:11.390
Cold! Cold! Okay. I'm fine.

07:12.891 --> 07:13.892
[Sighing]

07:14.017 --> 07:17.312
Tell me, Dr. Hartman,
do all the children fall in love with you?

07:18.146 --> 07:19.898
That's cold.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.152
Twenty-nine pounds.
That's big for your age.

07:24.236 --> 07:27.030
Forgive me for not being
one of those anorexic babies...

07:27.114 --> 07:28.824
...from the diaper commercials.

07:29.575 --> 07:31.869
All right, little guy,
time for your immunizations.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.496
-You might want to hold him.
-Hold me for what?

07:36.874 --> 07:39.710
-What the deuce?
-I'm sorry, sweetie.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.380
Back off! Don't come any closer
or I'll cut her!

07:45.632 --> 07:48.093
I'll give her a series of splinters...

07:48.760 --> 07:52.014
...that could, you know, become infected.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.683
Look, Stewie, look at the dancing kitty.

07:54.766 --> 07:57.728
Oh, no! I'll not be taken in
by one of your....

07:57.811 --> 08:01.565
Oh, my. That's delightful, isn't it?
What's your name, you little....

08:01.648 --> 08:02.858
Oh, God!

08:06.028 --> 08:08.071
They call this the magic hour.

08:08.238 --> 08:11.241
The day's not quite gone,
but the night's not quite here...

08:11.450 --> 08:15.037
...and somewhere, Scott Baio
is plowing a woman he doesn't love.

08:15.204 --> 08:16.705
I got one, Dad!

08:17.414 --> 08:19.708
Looks like that's the one that got away.

08:19.791 --> 08:23.754
The hell it is! You get in there,
and you kick that fish's ass!

08:24.671 --> 08:26.173
God, I love him!

08:26.256 --> 08:29.301
CLEVELAND: I can't believe
how terrible the fishing was.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.470
PETER: Yeah, all we caught was a tire,

08:31.553 --> 08:33.514
a boot, a tin can and
this book of clichés.

08:33.597 --> 08:37.226
JOE: Well, thank God we came prepared.
We brought enough food to last us....

08:39.603 --> 08:43.357
Holy crap, Chris! What the hell?
I put you in charge of the food.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.567
The raccoons were here. See?

08:45.984 --> 08:50.072
CHRIS: We're a bunch of sneaky animals.
We're gonna wreck this food and eat it...

08:50.155 --> 08:52.449
...'cause we're naughty.
And there's a guy.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.118
Let's get him in trouble with his dad.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.038
Somehow I'm less than surprised.

08:58.121 --> 09:01.500
I'm sorry, Dad.
I messed up the entire trip.

09:01.667 --> 09:05.212
PETER: It's not your fault, Chris.
I failed you as a father.

09:05.671 --> 09:07.714
From now on, Joe will be your father.

09:08.465 --> 09:09.466
Cleveland?

09:10.050 --> 09:14.555
I'll teach the boy. Come, my son.
I'll show you the ways of the herd.

09:14.638 --> 09:15.639
[Gunshot]

09:19.059 --> 09:20.060
Crap!

09:22.938 --> 09:25.816
Peter, why are you sitting
with the sheets over your head?

09:27.651 --> 09:30.195
-Peter, what's wrong?
-That obvious?

09:30.279 --> 09:34.032
Well, you always do the skull gag
when you're depressed. Talk to me.

09:34.116 --> 09:38.620
Well, it's just, I've been trying to teach
Chris how to be a man, you know?

09:38.745 --> 09:41.164
First, I tried teaching him
how to eat an Oreo.

09:41.331 --> 09:45.794
Chris, the way to eat an Oreo is
to twist it, pull it apart, and lick it.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.421
Now, you.

09:49.464 --> 09:52.009
I tried teaching him
how to get out of paying a check.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.851
Waiter, there's a dead guy in my soup.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.562
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
Of course your soup is gratis.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.398
Thank you. Now, your turn.

10:09.860 --> 10:12.654
Waiter, there's a dead guy in my....

10:12.738 --> 10:13.739
[Screaming]

10:18.368 --> 10:21.997
Peter, you can't force-feed maturity.
He needs to learn it on his own.

10:22.414 --> 10:25.542
-Why don't you get him a job?
-Freeze-frame!

10:26.001 --> 10:29.630
That's it! I can teach Chris
responsibility by getting him a job.

10:29.922 --> 10:32.466
Isn't she great?
Now you see why I married her.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.303
Go away now.
I'm going to do stuff to her.

10:38.764 --> 10:42.768
I'm sorry Stewie ruined your books.
Here, I brought you some of Peter's.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.562
Mr. T by Mr. T.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.857
T and Me by George Peppard.

10:49.733 --> 10:53.278
For the Last Time, I'm not Mr. T
by Ving Rhames.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.781
[Disgusted groaning]

10:55.864 --> 10:57.407
Stewie, are you okay?

10:57.491 --> 11:00.285
Must we make small talk
every time we pass?

11:00.369 --> 11:03.914
You're burning up!
Must be a reaction to the shots.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.749
I'll go get you some baby aspirin.

11:05.832 --> 11:09.545
What are you talking about? The shots
were supposed to make me healthy!

11:10.170 --> 11:13.715
You believe Lois had them inject you
with something to make you healthy?

11:13.799 --> 11:15.801
I mean, you were already healthy, right?

11:15.884 --> 11:19.429
Oh, God! You're right!
I was pink as a pistol!

11:19.513 --> 11:23.642
"Pink as a pistol!" Good Lord!
I can't even form a cogent simile anymore!

11:23.725 --> 11:26.520
-What was in those needles?
-I've already said too much.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.482
I should have known!
Her treachery knows no limits!

11:32.442 --> 11:35.612
Getting dizzy! Fight it, Stewie!

11:35.988 --> 11:38.866
"Do not go gentle into that good night,"
to quote Bob Dylan.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.661
No, no, Dylan Thomas.

11:44.788 --> 11:48.458
Boys, I'm a miracle worker.
I have used all my parenting skills...

11:48.542 --> 11:52.171
...to change my son from a lazy slacker
into a working man.

11:54.923 --> 11:57.050
-Nice going, Peter.
-Up yours, Joe.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.178
-What?
-Thanks. Hey, Chris.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.847
Hey, Dad! I'm working! I'm....

12:02.806 --> 12:05.517
Careful, Chris,
you don't get dental for 60 days.

12:05.601 --> 12:09.521

is the best ball shagger we ever had.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.404
I sold twice as many buckets today...

12:17.487 --> 12:19.740
...because everybody
wants to hit the fat kid.

12:19.823 --> 12:23.535

I gotta hit more balls at this fat kid.

12:23.869 --> 12:27.164
-Peter, do you mind if Kevin and I....
-Nail Chris? He'd be thrilled.

Oh, Peter. I can't make Cleveland Jr.
sit still for anything.

12:46.642 --> 12:49.603
Sometimes, I wonder
if he's got the epilepsy...

12:50.270 --> 12:53.065
...but then I just go see
what's on the TV.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.692
Well, maybe you're not
as good a father as me.

better than that dad on Lost in Space.

into the greatest golfer ever!

always wanted to be a Broadway dancer?

What have they done to me?

14:00.048 --> 14:03.802
It could be any number of things.
Gene manipulation, sterilization.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.179
They want my seed!

14:05.262 --> 14:09.600
But from the look of your pupils, I'd say
it's some kind of mind-control serum...

14:10.475 --> 14:11.476
...or not.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.064
Mind control? But I feel so lucid.

No!

15:00.901 --> 15:02.653
Why is he freaking out like that?

15:02.736 --> 15:05.447
He's having a little hallucination
from the fever...

15:05.531 --> 15:09.034
...just like when you were 3
and you ate those adult brownies...
