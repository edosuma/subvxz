00:02.767 --> 00:03.933
- VERNON: Previously
on "Still the King"--

00:04.033 --> 00:05.967
- How 'bout we hit the bar
down the street?

00:06.067 --> 00:07.033
- We're actually 16--

00:07.133 --> 00:08.700
- Sixteen minutes
late to college stuff.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.100
- How are my two
favorite parolees, huh?

00:11.200 --> 00:12.467
- We saw you yesterday, Doily.

00:12.567 --> 00:14.200
- Yeah, but you can't
hug through prison bars.

00:14.300 --> 00:15.500
- Not for a lack of trying.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.033
- Better watch
your mouth, Ronnie.

00:17.133 --> 00:19.200
- I might just have
what it takes to make it

00:19.300 --> 00:20.933
in this business.

00:21.033 --> 00:22.567
- You wanna make
it with me, Ronnie?

00:22.667 --> 00:24.500
- One of you is the father
of this baby.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.500
But apparently we're not
gonna know who anytime soon.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.933
- If it's April 3rd, that
means it's Deb's birthday.

00:30.033 --> 00:31.067
I gotta go.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.500
- [indistinct chatter]

00:36.600 --> 00:38.233
- [alarm sounds]

00:38.333 --> 00:40.800
- MAN: Roberts twins,
time to go.

00:40.900 --> 00:44.667
- *

00:53.833 --> 00:59.800
*

01:12.567 --> 01:17.967
*

01:20.100 --> 01:22.133
- You can talk to the hand?
- Hmm?

01:22.233 --> 01:23.700
- [smack]

01:23.800 --> 01:24.700
- ALL: Ooh.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.067
- Ow.
- Good God.

01:26.100 --> 01:29.133
- *

01:29.233 --> 01:30.133
- Wow.

01:30.233 --> 01:31.367
- Where are you off to?

01:31.467 --> 01:32.733
- Are you finally running away?

01:32.833 --> 01:35.133
- Ronnie has a retreat at
his boss's house this weekend,

01:35.233 --> 01:37.600
and he asked me to come along.

01:37.700 --> 01:38.933
- That's right.

01:39.067 --> 01:41.600
It's for those of us who like
the finer things in life.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.267
Mansions, shrimps,

01:43.367 --> 01:45.967
flying buttresses,
mansion servants.

01:46.067 --> 01:47.433
It's also gonna be at a mansion.

01:47.533 --> 01:49.067
- Wait, so this party's
at a mansion?

01:49.133 --> 01:50.233
- You're gonna need help
packing?

01:50.333 --> 01:52.933
- No. All set.

01:53.067 --> 01:55.933
[grunting]

01:56.067 --> 01:56.933
I'll be in the car.

01:57.067 --> 01:58.300
- VERNON: Drive safe.

01:59.900 --> 02:00.967
Seems like you two

02:01.067 --> 02:02.933
got a pretty hot and heavy
weekend planned.

02:03.067 --> 02:05.300
- So that's why Ronnie
showered this morning.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.433
- Not that it's any
of your business, but I've been

02:07.533 --> 02:10.067
assured there's two
double beds in the guestroom.

02:10.167 --> 02:11.433
- You know,
if you push them together,

02:11.533 --> 02:12.600
you'll have a giant love nest?

02:12.700 --> 02:14.433
- I just need you two
on your best behavior

02:14.533 --> 02:15.500
while I'm gone, okay?

02:15.600 --> 02:16.900
Keep an eye on her, please.

02:17.067 --> 02:18.067
- Mom, I'm 16.

02:18.167 --> 02:19.067
I don't need a babysitter.

02:19.133 --> 02:20.267
- It's a good point.

02:20.367 --> 02:21.767
Look after him instead.

02:23.300 --> 02:24.867
And don't spend it on fast food.

02:24.967 --> 02:26.233
- CHARLOTTE: I won't!

02:26.333 --> 02:28.367
- I was talking to your dad.
- CHARLOTTE: Bye, love you.

02:28.467 --> 02:30.800
- Drive safe.
- Love you.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.333
- You know, I'm a little
offended that your mother

02:33.433 --> 02:36.333
doesn't trust us enough to act
in a responsible fashion

02:36.433 --> 02:37.467
over the weekend.

02:37.567 --> 02:38.933
- We're responsible.
- I know.

02:39.067 --> 02:41.467
I do have couple of buddies
that run an illegal poker game

02:41.567 --> 02:43.233
out of the back
of a pizza joint downtown.

02:43.333 --> 02:45.633
We could double our money.

02:45.733 --> 02:46.800
[laughs]

02:46.900 --> 02:48.133
- I'll go get my shoes.

02:48.233 --> 02:53.067
- *

02:53.133 --> 02:56.500
- [indistinct chatter]

03:01.067 --> 03:02.800
- Boom! Aces full of jacks!

03:02.900 --> 03:05.667
I'm on a heater round, you're
not gonna remember me again.

03:05.767 --> 03:08.067
- Well, that was
your child support money.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.200
But I guess that just
cuts out the middle man.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.933
- Hey, there you are.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.333
I thought I'd find you here.

03:13.433 --> 03:15.400
You know they say best friends
can read each other's minds.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.800
- Doily, I told you
they were here.

03:16.900 --> 03:18.667
You only agreed to come
when you got hungry.

03:18.767 --> 03:19.467
- That's true.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.667
- Guys, have a seat.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.800
I'll deal you in.
- Oh, no, no, no.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.067
We gotta go, come on.

03:24.133 --> 03:27.067
It's P.A.L.S. weekend:
Parolee And Lawman Social.

03:27.167 --> 03:28.533
- Weekend dedicated
to team building

03:28.633 --> 03:30.367
between parole officers
and their parolees.

03:30.467 --> 03:31.933
- Wait, wait, this is a thing?

03:32.067 --> 03:33.667
It sounds highly volatile.

03:33.767 --> 03:36.067
- It could be dangerous,
but fun.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.467
- You know, I promised her mom
that I'd stick around,

03:38.567 --> 03:39.800
keep an eye on her.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.133
- Oh yeah. No biggie.

03:42.233 --> 03:46.067
If you wanna go back to jail
and violate your parole, fine.

03:46.167 --> 03:47.733
- He ain't bluffing, Vern.

03:47.833 --> 03:50.367
He said he was gonna tase me
if I didn't get in the car.

03:50.467 --> 03:52.100
Then he tased me.
- I did, I did.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.900
- Twice.
- [laughing]

03:54.067 --> 03:55.133
- It's not funny.
- Sorta.

03:55.233 --> 03:56.700
- You know what, Dad,
you need to go.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.567
Okay, I don't need a babysitter.
I'm fine.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.067
You can trust me.
- Are you sure?

04:00.167 --> 04:02.067
Man, if your mom finds out,
she'll kill me.

04:02.100 --> 04:03.767
- Have fun, you deserve it.

04:03.867 --> 04:05.633
- Alright. Do me a favor though.

04:05.733 --> 04:07.700
Just keep an eye
on Dwayne, alright?

04:07.800 --> 04:09.300
He's had kind of a rough year.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.667
- DOILY: Alright, let's go.

04:10.767 --> 04:16.067
- *

04:16.133 --> 04:18.267
- Turns out, getting a job...

04:18.367 --> 04:20.200
isn't a hellish nightmare
I thought'd it be.

04:20.300 --> 04:21.533
Plus, I get to take you

04:21.633 --> 04:23.067
on a "romantical" weekends
like this.

04:23.133 --> 04:25.133
- Just a reminder, treating me
to fancy weekends

04:25.233 --> 04:27.167
does not mean sex.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.067
- Alright. Ah.

04:29.167 --> 04:31.700
- You want me to put that
in the Ronnie pocket for you?

04:31.800 --> 04:32.533
- No, babe.

04:32.633 --> 04:34.600
We can get fresh ones.

04:34.700 --> 04:36.633
We're above purse snacks now.

04:36.733 --> 04:37.700
- Ooh.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.267
- We're living the good life.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.533
- Care for a mask?

04:41.633 --> 04:44.667
- Oh, we're good, thank you.

04:44.767 --> 04:46.133
- What?

04:46.233 --> 04:47.400
- *

04:47.500 --> 04:49.467
- Dang, everything's so big.

04:49.567 --> 04:52.233
- Look, Ronnie,
it's a champagne fountain.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.433
- Look at the curtain rings.

04:54.533 --> 04:56.700
- So, it's true what they say.

04:56.800 --> 04:59.500
Behind every great man
is a woman.

04:59.600 --> 05:05.133
And behind that woman is me.

05:05.233 --> 05:07.067
Bonjour.

05:07.167 --> 05:10.067
- Ronnie, you didn't tell me
this was a masquerade party.

05:10.133 --> 05:11.833
- Oh, it's not.

05:11.933 --> 05:13.500
* Hello

05:13.600 --> 05:15.433
- Deb, meet Coy.

05:15.533 --> 05:18.167
He's the genius behind
this whole operation.

05:18.267 --> 05:20.800
- Your Ronnie here
is one of my top stallions.

05:20.900 --> 05:23.833
I got big plans for him.
[laughs]

05:23.933 --> 05:25.300
- You talking top stallions
over here?

05:25.400 --> 05:27.567
My ears are burning.
- Excuse me, boys,

05:27.667 --> 05:32.067
but I am going to trot this mare
over to the bar.

05:32.167 --> 05:33.633
Clipity-clopy, clipity-clop.

05:33.733 --> 05:35.333
- You guys really likes horses.

05:35.433 --> 05:37.400
- *

05:37.500 --> 05:39.067
- What are you doing here,
Pony Boy?

05:39.167 --> 05:41.067
- Coy personally invited me.

05:41.100 --> 05:43.200
- Coy personally
invited everyone, you idiot.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.767
It's his house.

05:44.867 --> 05:46.967
Just because you're hanging out
with the stallions, doesn't mean

05:47.067 --> 05:49.600
you're gonna be invited
into Coy's inner-sanctum.

05:49.700 --> 05:52.100
- Oh.
- His private cigar lounge.

05:52.200 --> 05:55.267
That's where only
the top stallions run unbridled.

05:55.367 --> 05:57.167
- Oh, I can outrun
any stallion.

05:57.267 --> 05:59.433
- Yeah?

05:59.533 --> 06:01.167
- [crunch]

06:04.433 --> 06:05.867
- Even got my own cigar.

06:05.967 --> 06:07.700
- You're a real class act,
Ronnie.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.300
Let's get out here, Blake.
- See ya there.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.633
[spitting]

06:12.733 --> 06:14.933
- [door dings]

06:15.067 --> 06:16.867
- Oh my God.
I can't believe that worked.

06:16.967 --> 06:18.800
- I know, that was so much fun.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.567
I wish my parents would leave
town every once in a while.

06:21.667 --> 06:22.933
Or the house, really.

06:23.067 --> 06:24.633
Wait, what time are
Lloyd's friends coming over?

06:24.733 --> 06:26.300
- Uh, I think I told him 8.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.733
I need to have
everyone out by 10,

06:27.833 --> 06:29.367
so me and Lloyd
can have some alone time.

06:29.467 --> 06:30.500
- Got it.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.600
- Good thing
you got prophylactics.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.067
- Got what?
- These, condoms.

06:35.167 --> 06:38.900
- Okay, Mabel, you don't
have to show the world.

06:39.067 --> 06:41.367
- You know, I read in "Cosmo"
that it's good

06:41.467 --> 06:44.600
for an independent feminist
to carry her own box of condoms.

06:44.700 --> 06:47.067
That could have helped
my mom at least 1 or 14 times.

06:47.167 --> 06:49.067
- *

06:49.100 --> 06:50.900
- What the hell
you got us into here, son?

06:51.067 --> 06:53.067
- Oh, this is gonna be fun.
Hi, Timmy.

06:53.167 --> 06:54.600
Hey, Joe. Hey, Spider.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.833
- In addition
to the Best P.A.L. title,

06:56.933 --> 07:00.700
the winner will receive
this state-of-the-art ham radio,

07:00.800 --> 07:04.667
and a $200 gift card
to Cracker Barrel.

07:04.767 --> 07:06.200
- Oh, I want that gift card.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.533
- I want that radio.

07:07.633 --> 07:09.867
- Hey, Doily.
- Hey.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.767
Freaking Don.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.333
I don't know what my ex-wife
Cynthia sees in him.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.667
- *

07:22.767 --> 07:24.067
- Those friends of yours, Vern?

07:24.100 --> 07:25.933
- No, I'm pretty sure
those guys wanna kill me.

07:26.067 --> 07:27.133
- Lose the bad attitude, man.

07:27.233 --> 07:29.333
We're gonna kill them.
We're athletes.

07:29.433 --> 07:30.867
They're not athletes.

07:30.967 --> 07:33.067
- No, I mean it, man,
those guys hate me.

07:33.100 --> 07:34.400
They vowed
they're gonna murder me

07:34.500 --> 07:36.600
the day they got out of prison.

07:36.700 --> 07:40.067
- I don't know.
They were always cool with me.

07:40.133 --> 07:41.100
- Hey.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.733
[whispering]

07:42.833 --> 07:46.467
- Then why does it say
"Kill Vern" on their knuckles?

07:46.567 --> 07:49.400
- *

07:49.500 --> 07:52.833
- Huh. I never noticed that.

07:52.933 --> 07:54.533
They are such jokers, man.

07:54.633 --> 07:56.467
- Let's have some fun.

07:56.567 --> 07:57.500
Go, P.A.L.S.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.467
- [doorbell rings]

07:58.567 --> 08:02.700
- Oh, uh, um...okay.

08:02.800 --> 08:06.300
[indistinct whispering]

08:06.400 --> 08:08.433
- I am ready to party.

08:08.533 --> 08:09.567
- Okay, it's not a party.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.167
It's a kickback.

08:11.267 --> 08:13.733
- Right.

08:13.833 --> 08:16.067
- Hi.
- Hey, is this the party?

08:16.167 --> 08:18.833
- Yeah, it's a party--
- Yeah, alright.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.400
Okay, hi, how are you?

08:20.500 --> 08:21.600
Mwah.
- Good.

08:21.700 --> 08:22.967
Hey, I invited
a couple of my friends.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.733
Is that cool?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:24.833 --> 08:27.300
- Yeah?
- Alright, come on in, y'all.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.433
- Wow, that's big.

08:28.533 --> 08:30.067
- Put that in the kitchen.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.833
Get that going on the table.

08:31.933 --> 08:32.967
- These are all your friends?

08:33.067 --> 08:35.500
- Oh no, that's dangerous.
- Okay.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.433
Nice to meet you all. Yeah.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.067
- When you're standing
in one of these crop circles,

08:43.133 --> 08:44.567
you'll notice the grass
is actually woven together.

08:44.667 --> 08:46.300
- Okay, okay, thank you, Walt.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.067
Maybe someone else
would like to share.

08:48.133 --> 08:50.267
Maybe something
a little more on topic.

08:50.367 --> 08:51.833
- Yah, I miss prison.

08:51.933 --> 08:53.633
I love my life there.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.833
I had discipline.

08:55.933 --> 08:58.200
I knew who I was, you know?

08:58.300 --> 09:00.067
I mean, truth be told,
I would do anything

09:00.167 --> 09:02.100
to get my ass back inside.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.100
Anything.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.567
- Now, that's fairly common.

09:04.667 --> 09:08.733
And I would suggest taking
some CrossFit classes.

09:08.833 --> 09:10.667
Maybe sleeping in your closet
for a while.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.467
- You know, I'd like to share.

09:12.567 --> 09:15.933
I feel sad for Mitch Doily,
who never wins.

09:16.067 --> 09:19.667
And, uh, I feel happy
for his sweet ex-wife Cynthia

09:19.767 --> 09:21.800
who now has me as a lover.

09:21.900 --> 09:23.200
- Suck it, Don.

09:23.300 --> 09:25.300
- Okay, thanks, Don.
Who else?

09:25.400 --> 09:26.800
- Me.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.067
- *

09:28.100 --> 09:30.900
- I got a friend who feels--

09:31.067 --> 09:32.767
- Vengeful.

09:32.867 --> 09:34.067
- --vengeful.

09:34.167 --> 09:35.533
Towards a certain person who

09:35.633 --> 09:39.067
really screwed him
and his twin brother over.

09:39.167 --> 09:41.467
- This person pinned
[bleep] on him.

09:41.567 --> 09:43.833
And they were sent
to solitary confinement

09:43.933 --> 09:45.600
for a year.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.733
- Well, maybe this person

09:47.833 --> 09:50.800
was stuck between
a rock and a hard place.

09:50.900 --> 09:54.067
- Well, maybe this person
better watch out,

09:54.100 --> 09:56.333
because my friend...

09:56.433 --> 10:01.167
and his brother
ain't too happy about it.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.133
- Man, I'd hate
to be that person.

10:03.233 --> 10:05.667
- Yeah, that person out there's
in some serious danger.

10:05.767 --> 10:07.867
- Hello!
Does nobody else here realize

10:07.967 --> 10:10.700
this person they're talking
about is me?

10:10.800 --> 10:12.667
- WOMAN: Vernon!
You're projecting.

10:12.767 --> 10:14.967
Okay, not everything
is about you.

10:15.067 --> 10:17.000
Okay? Alright.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.367
That is good work, everyone.

10:18.467 --> 10:21.233
We did good work today.

10:21.333 --> 10:23.133
- * Take it off,
take it off, whoo-hoo *

10:23.233 --> 10:24.867
* Take it off, take it off,
whoo-hoo *

10:24.967 --> 10:26.900
* Go down
to your birthday suit *

10:27.000 --> 10:28.867
* Who cares
who's watching you *

10:28.967 --> 10:30.467
* Take it off, take it off,
whoo-hoo *

10:30.567 --> 10:32.667
* Take it off,
take it off, whoo-hoo *

10:32.767 --> 10:34.267
* [unintelligible]

10:34.367 --> 10:36.567
* So get on down
to your birthday suit *

10:36.667 --> 10:38.267
*

10:38.367 --> 10:41.767
- Hey, I was wondering
if you wanted to check out

10:41.867 --> 10:44.600
my stained glass window...alone.

10:44.700 --> 10:47.400
- *

10:47.500 --> 10:48.267
- Yes.

10:48.367 --> 10:50.867
Yes, of course, I would, please.

10:50.967 --> 10:53.800
Take me to your window.

10:53.900 --> 10:55.367
- * Ain't no shame
in your underwear *

10:55.467 --> 10:57.067
* One more step,
then we'll be there *

10:57.167 --> 10:59.267
* Just come with me

10:59.367 --> 11:01.333
* Take it off, take it off,
whoo-hoo *

11:01.433 --> 11:03.167
* Take it off,
take it off, whoo-hoo *

11:03.267 --> 11:05.267
- MAN: Hey, guys, I heard
there's a stained glass window

11:05.367 --> 11:07.800
up here.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.600
Wow.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.233
I mean, that's a real
stained glass window.

11:12.333 --> 11:15.067
Yeah, hey, Derrick, Justin,
check out this room up there,

11:15.100 --> 11:16.367
this window, man.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.633
- Jeffery?

11:17.733 --> 11:19.633
- I mean, I've never seen
anything like this before.

11:19.733 --> 11:20.933
It's amazing.

11:21.067 --> 11:22.067
Look at the craftsmanship.

11:22.167 --> 11:23.433
- [indistinct chatter]

11:23.533 --> 11:25.800
- Hey, everybody, check out
this stained glass window.

11:25.900 --> 11:27.167
It's amazing.

11:27.267 --> 11:28.633
- Mabel.

11:28.733 --> 11:32.133
You are doing a really bad job
at distracting Lloyd's friends.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.067
Let's get everyone
back downstairs.

11:34.167 --> 11:36.167
- Okay, I got it.
- Okay.

11:36.267 --> 11:37.933
- Who wants to do keg stands?

11:38.067 --> 11:40.567
- ALL: [cheering]

11:40.667 --> 11:43.833
- ALL: [laughing]

11:43.933 --> 11:45.833
- Hey, Bill.
- Hey, Vance.

11:45.933 --> 11:47.500
- One Neutral Light, please.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.067
- Here you go.

11:51.133 --> 11:53.200
- Neutral Light?

11:53.300 --> 11:54.567
Real classy there, Ron.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.233
- Uh, yeah.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.667
Yeah, Neutral Light,
prince of beers.

11:58.767 --> 12:02.600
Both Neutral and Light.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.500
- The last time I drank
a Neutral Light

12:04.600 --> 12:06.067
was as a dare in college.

12:06.133 --> 12:07.433
- Hey, Blake, remind me.

12:07.533 --> 12:08.933
Where was it you went
to college?

12:09.067 --> 12:10.533
- Uh, you might
have heard of it. Harvard!

12:10.633 --> 12:13.500
- Boom! You just got the H bomb
dropped on you.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.067
I myself am
a Phoenix University man.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.333
Went there on
a full lacrosse scholarship.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.767
How 'bout you, Ronnie?
Where'd you go?

12:20.867 --> 12:23.367
- Uh...where'd I go?

12:23.467 --> 12:24.433
Um...

12:24.533 --> 12:27.100
- Actually, Ronnie
was a self-starter.

12:27.200 --> 12:30.067
He didn't need college
or a second half-ass school.

12:30.133 --> 12:31.100
- Well, that's impressive.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.667
And, um, what was your industry?

12:33.767 --> 12:35.633
- Uh, you know, um...

12:35.733 --> 12:37.067
- Just boats.
- Mm-hmm.

12:37.100 --> 12:39.433
- Actually, he had
his own television show.

12:39.533 --> 12:41.500
"Onboard with Ronnie."
I'm sure you saw it.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.633
- And a new baby, I presume.
- Uh-huh, yeah.

12:43.733 --> 12:45.333
- You must so proud.

12:45.433 --> 12:46.867
Have you thought of some names?

12:46.967 --> 12:48.933
- I got one--
- Actually, we have.

12:49.067 --> 12:51.400
If it's a boy,
it's gonna be Ronford Junior.

12:51.500 --> 12:55.233
Although those are
pretty big footsteps to fill.

12:55.333 --> 12:58.467
I couldn't ask for a better man
to be by my side.

12:58.567 --> 13:01.167
- Now you got
one on both sides.

13:01.267 --> 13:03.200
Can you imagine?

13:07.467 --> 13:08.800
- Okay, next up is Vernon Brown.

13:08.900 --> 13:11.100
- *

13:12.733 --> 13:15.467
- [indistinct whispers]

13:17.100 --> 13:18.167
- Huh-uh.

13:18.267 --> 13:20.300
- Vernon, this exercise
is all about trust.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.633
And it's important
that you trust them.

13:22.733 --> 13:24.600
- I don't though.
I'm not doing it.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.367
- Well, you have to,
otherwise our team's

13:26.467 --> 13:27.533
gonna be disqualified.

13:27.633 --> 13:29.433
We'll have to pay
for Cracker Barrel food.

13:29.533 --> 13:30.833
- Come on.

13:30.933 --> 13:32.633
- You know, technically,
anyone from your team can fall.

13:32.733 --> 13:34.500
- Okay, great, I'll do it.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.633
Vernon, I'll take your place.

13:35.733 --> 13:37.900
You're being ridiculous.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.067
I'm gonna show you just
how much I can trust, buddy.

13:41.767 --> 13:44.467
- Mitch, I don't think that we
can catch you from that high up.

13:44.567 --> 13:45.567
- Vernon, watch this.

13:45.667 --> 13:47.967
- Oh my God, go, go, go, go!

13:48.067 --> 13:52.633
- It's e-e-e-e-easy!

13:52.733 --> 13:57.067
- *

14:05.100 --> 14:05.833
- ALL: [groans]

14:05.933 --> 14:08.067
- Doily, get up!
- Doily--

14:08.133 --> 14:10.200
- Come on, man!

14:10.300 --> 14:12.600
- [laughs] That was fun, fellas.

14:12.700 --> 14:15.300
- [chanting] Chug,
chug, chug, chug.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.067
- [metal clangs]

14:18.633 --> 14:20.300
- [gasps]

14:22.333 --> 14:23.900
I'm too drunk to feel pain?

14:25.567 --> 14:27.533
I'm too drunk to feel pain!

14:27.633 --> 14:30.467
- ALL: [cheering]

14:30.567 --> 14:35.800
- *

14:35.900 --> 14:37.533
- You think that guy
was a real doctor?

14:37.633 --> 14:39.933
- Oh my God, I hope so--

14:40.067 --> 14:42.500
- Oh my.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.433
My special, special couple.

14:45.533 --> 14:47.733
I'd like to invite you both
to come inside

14:47.833 --> 14:50.933
my special, special place.

14:51.067 --> 14:52.600
Hmm?

14:52.700 --> 14:55.200
My private seagull.

14:55.300 --> 14:56.467
- Nice.

14:56.567 --> 14:59.200
- Wouldn't it be a shame
to end the evening here?

14:59.300 --> 15:01.200
Hmm?

15:01.300 --> 15:03.067
Hmm?

15:03.167 --> 15:05.400
Hmm?

15:05.500 --> 15:09.467
- [indistinct party chatter]

15:09.567 --> 15:10.667
- This is it, Deb.

15:10.767 --> 15:12.367
We get to role
with the top stallions now.

15:12.467 --> 15:14.633
- Oh, Ronnie, that's great.

15:14.733 --> 15:16.067
You know what?

15:16.100 --> 15:18.200
I think I'm just gonna go
try find something to eat

15:18.300 --> 15:19.567
and head to the room.

15:19.667 --> 15:22.567
Smoke probably
isn't good for the baby.

15:22.667 --> 15:23.633
You should go.

15:23.733 --> 15:26.533
- Really? You sure?
- Yes! Yes!

15:26.633 --> 15:29.467
Ronnie, this is important.

15:29.567 --> 15:32.233
You go get 'em.

15:32.333 --> 15:33.933
- COY: Ronnie?

15:34.067 --> 15:37.867
- [moaning]

15:37.967 --> 15:43.433
- [indistinct party noises]

15:43.533 --> 15:45.633
- [laughing]

15:45.733 --> 15:48.233
That is so hot.

15:48.333 --> 15:50.333
Mammoth. How'd you know?

15:50.433 --> 15:53.067
- I guessed.

15:53.100 --> 15:56.600
- Hey, you know if you mix
Schnapps with coffee liqueur,

15:56.700 --> 15:58.233
it tastes--it tastes like--

15:58.333 --> 15:59.800
- [vomiting]
- [screaming]

15:59.900 --> 16:03.200
- Mabel! Oh, really? Not my--

16:03.300 --> 16:04.333
- I'm sorry, Charlotte.

16:04.433 --> 16:07.433
I just--I don't think
tonight's our night.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.100
- [vomiting]
- [screaming]

16:09.200 --> 16:11.167
- Oh my God, that's--
- I'll get a bucket.

16:11.267 --> 16:12.200
Uh, uh, hold it, hold it.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.367
Come on, come on,
bathroom, let's go.

16:14.467 --> 16:16.333
- Vernon, I just overheard
the Roberts twins saying

16:16.433 --> 16:18.533
they're gonna shank you
at the finish line.

16:18.633 --> 16:20.200
I'm starting to think
they're bad dudes.

16:20.300 --> 16:21.567
- Welcome to the party.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.200
I got an idea.

16:23.300 --> 16:26.533
Hey, Hank.
You still homesick for prison?

16:26.633 --> 16:28.267
- With every fiber
of my whole being.

16:28.367 --> 16:29.700
You got no idea.

16:29.800 --> 16:33.367
You know, inside, I was
Hank the Shank, you know?

16:33.467 --> 16:38.133
Out here, I'm just Henry Dupree,
the man who stabbed

16:38.233 --> 16:42.433
his wife's lover
with a sharpened toothbrush.

16:42.533 --> 16:43.600
- I'll tell you what.

16:43.700 --> 16:45.733
I got an idea that might
help the two of us.

16:45.833 --> 16:47.700
You see these two guys
standing over here.

16:47.800 --> 16:48.833
Come here, check this out.

16:48.933 --> 16:50.467
- I never did like those two.

16:50.567 --> 16:53.333
- *

16:57.533 --> 16:59.700
- Ew.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.767
Luxury clotted cream?

17:01.867 --> 17:03.967
Gross.
- Here's Ronnie.

17:04.067 --> 17:05.767
I got the cure for the cravings.

17:05.867 --> 17:06.933
I got the waffles.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.200
I got the hash browns.

17:08.300 --> 17:09.067
I got the chicken.

17:09.167 --> 17:11.667
- Yes, yes! You read my mind.

17:11.767 --> 17:13.067
- For the babies.

17:13.100 --> 17:16.067
Ronford Junior and I
are pretty simpatico.

17:16.167 --> 17:18.067
- The kid has good taste
in hash browns.

17:18.133 --> 17:19.533
What happened
to the cigar lounge

17:19.633 --> 17:20.967
and the stallions?

17:21.067 --> 17:23.233
- Uh, I figured I'd have
more fun with you two.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.367
Besides, thanks for having
my back down there.

17:25.467 --> 17:26.867
- [laughs] It wasn't easy.

17:26.967 --> 17:29.667
- Yeah, I know you don't have
a lot to work with.

17:29.767 --> 17:30.833
What's that?
- What?

17:30.933 --> 17:33.833
- Ronford Junior? Is that you?

17:33.933 --> 17:35.933
You want mama and dada
to push the bed together?

17:36.067 --> 17:37.833
Have a family sleepover?

17:37.933 --> 17:39.667
- Don't push your luck. [laughs]

17:39.767 --> 17:41.533
- Baby's wishes, you know?
- [laughs]

17:41.633 --> 17:44.200
- *

17:44.300 --> 17:47.167
- You know, maybe it would be
more comfortable...for the baby.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.533
- For the baby.

17:48.633 --> 17:51.267
- I don't--I want your hands
above the covers all night.

17:51.367 --> 17:53.267
- It's not my hands
you have to worry about.

17:53.367 --> 17:55.300
- [laughs] Oh God.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.833
[groans]

17:57.933 --> 17:59.467
Let's see. What do we got here.

17:59.567 --> 18:01.800
- *

18:13.267 --> 18:14.700
- Okay.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.433
On your mark.

18:16.533 --> 18:18.467
Get set.

18:18.567 --> 18:20.100
Go!

18:20.200 --> 18:21.900
- *

18:22.067 --> 18:25.600
- We're going so fast,
I feel like Usain Bolt.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.467
- Vernon, they're gaining on us.

18:27.567 --> 18:29.100
- It's shanking time.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.100
- [screams]

18:30.200 --> 18:32.567
- *

18:32.667 --> 18:35.933
- [cheering]

18:36.067 --> 18:37.800
- [indistinct yelling]

18:37.900 --> 18:38.767
- We did it!

18:38.867 --> 18:40.400
Yeah!

18:40.500 --> 18:42.900
- [indistinct yelling]

18:49.067 --> 18:50.967
- Did you see the cheetahs
in the backyard last night?

18:51.067 --> 18:52.367
- I thought those
were painted cats.

18:52.467 --> 18:53.600
- No.

18:53.700 --> 18:57.333
- RONNIE: '98 Dodge Neon,
please.

18:57.433 --> 18:58.533
Oh boy.

18:58.633 --> 19:02.167
- Look who it is.
A butthole attached to a neck.

19:02.267 --> 19:04.067
You missed an epic time
last night.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.133
We smoked like a million cigars.

19:06.233 --> 19:07.900
My lungs burn so good right now.

19:08.067 --> 19:09.300
[laughs]

19:09.400 --> 19:12.400
[coughing]

19:13.467 --> 19:15.900
- Can you get
tuberculous in one night?

19:16.067 --> 19:18.067
- We had a big breakfast
this morning.

19:18.167 --> 19:20.400
And everything taste
like a fine cigar.

19:20.500 --> 19:23.367
- That's how you know
you had a good time.

19:23.467 --> 19:26.067
- Well, we had an amazing night
just doing our own thing.

19:26.100 --> 19:27.900
- Yeah, that's right.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.667
And breakfast tasted
like breakfast.

19:29.767 --> 19:31.067
- [horn honks]
- Yawn.

19:31.133 --> 19:33.267
- Alright, saddle up.

19:33.367 --> 19:35.567
We need you to get to
Smoking Little Hair of the Dog.

19:35.667 --> 19:36.933
It'll fix you right up.

19:37.067 --> 19:39.400
Sir, a little something for you.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.400
Keep the change.

19:40.500 --> 19:44.067
Kazah!

19:44.167 --> 19:46.300
- Did you really have
a good time last night?

19:46.400 --> 19:47.800
- Yeah, I did.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.600
- Me, too.

19:49.700 --> 19:52.067
- I should call and check in
on Vernon and Charlotte.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.733
- [phone ringing]

19:53.833 --> 19:55.267
- Debbie.

19:55.367 --> 19:58.600
Nope, everything is great.

19:58.700 --> 20:01.000
Nope.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.667
I told you you could trust me.

20:06.767 --> 20:08.267
Okay.

20:08.367 --> 20:10.000
I'll see you when you get home.

20:10.100 --> 20:12.333
- [glasses shattering]

20:12.433 --> 20:14.000
- What the hell?

20:14.100 --> 20:16.033
You said I could trust you.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.433
Your mama is gonna be pissed.

20:18.533 --> 20:19.767
- [glasses shattering]

20:19.867 --> 20:22.033
- At me or at you, because
you said you were gonna stay

20:22.133 --> 20:24.467
and then you left, so--

20:24.567 --> 20:25.567
- Well played.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.367
Better get me a bag.

20:27.467 --> 20:30.300
- *

20:39.667 --> 20:40.633
- Hi, guys.

20:40.733 --> 20:42.000
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.

20:42.100 --> 20:45.500
Whoo, pretty big weekend.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.800
But I'm pretty jetlagged,

20:47.900 --> 20:49.467
so I'm gonna catch up
with y'all later.

20:49.567 --> 20:51.767
- Ronnie, you can't get jetlag
from road trips.

20:51.867 --> 20:53.000
- So how was the weekend alone?

20:53.100 --> 20:54.600
- Good, good.
- Yeah.

20:54.700 --> 20:55.900
- How was yours?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.600
- It was good.
- VERN: Good.

20:57.700 --> 20:59.433
- What'd you guys do?

20:59.533 --> 21:01.900
- Um, we just played
some card games and--

21:02.067 --> 21:03.833
- Watched "Slap Fighter."
- --a movie, hmm.

21:03.933 --> 21:05.800
- "Slap Fighter
Four: Still Slapping."

21:05.900 --> 21:07.367
- Yeah. It was really good.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.800
The guy comes back at the end
and slaps him with a foot

21:09.900 --> 21:10.867
instead of his hand.

21:10.967 --> 21:12.400
- VERN: It was pretty cool.
- Yeah.

21:12.500 --> 21:13.667
- What the hell?

21:13.767 --> 21:15.433
Whose are these?

21:15.533 --> 21:19.267
- VERN: Um, I was looking
for a place to put these,

21:19.367 --> 21:21.200
and put them in the wrong place.

21:21.300 --> 21:22.700
- Vern nice, Vern.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.167
- *

21:29.533 --> 21:31.800
- I'm gonna assume you had
this conversation with your mom.

21:31.900 --> 21:32.833
- Yeah, yeah.

21:32.933 --> 21:34.300
I'm all good, thanks.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.633
- *

21:38.833 --> 21:42.867
- BOTH: [imitating explosion]

21:42.967 --> 21:45.967
[grunting]

21:46.067 --> 21:47.433
- Through the fire.

21:47.533 --> 21:51.733
- [grunting]

21:51.833 --> 21:53.367
- Flaming arrow.

21:53.467 --> 21:57.067
[imitating soaring arrows]

21:57.167 --> 21:59.500
- [groaning]

21:59.600 --> 22:01.633
- Oh, hey, Vernon.

22:01.733 --> 22:03.433
- * Say oh *

22:07.467 --> 22:09.167
- *
