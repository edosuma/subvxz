WEBVTT

00:00.017 --> 00:01.418
<i>Previously, on "Suits":</i>

00:01.419 --> 00:02.484
It was years ago,

00:02.485 --> 00:03.968
and it was only one time,

00:03.969 --> 00:05.335
but Donna and I slept together.

00:05.521 --> 00:07.359
I understand why you go after

00:07.360 --> 00:09.160
the unattainable woman.

00:09.196 --> 00:11.429
You are titillated by
what you cannot have.

00:11.464 --> 00:12.497
But I can have her, Doc.

00:12.532 --> 00:14.199
The only circumstances

00:14.234 --> 00:15.834
under which you can have her

00:15.869 --> 00:17.836
are if you choose to be
the bad boy.

00:17.871 --> 00:19.370
This is the second time

00:19.406 --> 00:20.783
that you haven't told me
the full truth

00:20.807 --> 00:21.906
in as many conversations,

00:21.942 --> 00:24.509
and right now, what I need
is some time to myself.

00:24.544 --> 00:25.443
- Paula, please...
- No.

00:25.478 --> 00:26.689
If you can't put
my need to process

00:26.713 --> 00:28.346
over your need to feel okay

00:28.381 --> 00:29.948
about yourself,

00:29.983 --> 00:32.049
then I'm afraid
we'll never get past this.

00:32.085 --> 00:33.151
Louis.

00:33.186 --> 00:34.686
What are you do...

00:36.923 --> 00:37.789
We're going into
your building,

00:37.824 --> 00:39.624
and we're going in there
right now.

00:39.659 --> 00:40.803
I'm ready to be your bad boy.

00:40.827 --> 00:42.360
<i>It was 12 years ago.</i>

00:42.395 --> 00:44.395
I've come so far.

00:44.431 --> 00:45.663
I made peace with my mom,

00:45.699 --> 00:47.932
and you're the one
that helped me with that,

00:47.968 --> 00:48.766
not Donna.

00:48.802 --> 00:50.902
So, the question is,

00:50.937 --> 00:52.637
you still want to come with me?

00:52.672 --> 00:54.639
I do, Harvey.

01:01.982 --> 01:03.114
Hey.

01:03.149 --> 01:04.882
Hey.

01:04.918 --> 01:06.551
Want a cup of coffee?

01:06.586 --> 01:08.086
Is it the morning?

01:14.794 --> 01:15.760
You know, for someone
who doesn't cook,

01:15.795 --> 01:17.073
you make surprisingly good
coffee.

01:17.097 --> 01:21.099
As I recall, I made you
a delicious steak dinner

01:21.134 --> 01:22.233
not too long ago.

01:22.269 --> 01:23.234
Yeah, and we both know

01:23.270 --> 01:24.402
that grilling isn't cooking.

01:24.437 --> 01:25.270
Obviously, you've never had

01:25.305 --> 01:27.438
a double Whopper with cheese.

01:27.474 --> 01:28.907
True, but I can't imagine

01:28.942 --> 01:31.075
it has anything on this coffee.

01:31.111 --> 01:33.077
Put something extra in it,
don't you?

01:33.113 --> 01:34.612
Vanilla.

01:36.116 --> 01:37.448
What?

01:37.484 --> 01:38.750
Paula,

01:38.785 --> 01:40.363
I know the last few days
have been rough,

01:40.387 --> 01:41.587
but I promise you,
from now on,

01:41.621 --> 01:43.788
I'm not gonna keep
something important from you

01:43.823 --> 01:46.457
just because I'm scared.

01:46.493 --> 01:47.458
Thank you, Harvey.

01:49.429 --> 01:51.229
What do you say
we go out tonight,

01:51.264 --> 01:52.764
have a nice dinner,

01:52.799 --> 01:53.965
and remind ourselves

01:54.000 --> 01:56.634
why we're together
in the first place?

01:56.670 --> 01:59.304
Yeah, that'd be nice.
I'd like that.

02:07.480 --> 02:08.645
Shit.

02:08.681 --> 02:10.414
My cell's in the living room.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:25.365 --> 02:27.165
I know someone's there.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.501
You should know,
I'm armed and dangerous,

02:30.537 --> 02:34.305
so get out now
while you still can.

02:34.341 --> 02:37.575
This is your last chance.

02:37.610 --> 02:39.644
I have a gun,
and I'm ready to use it.

02:39.679 --> 02:40.578
Good.

02:40.613 --> 02:43.381
But that's not the gun
I'm here for.

02:46.353 --> 02:47.563
So you better be
locked and loaded,

02:47.587 --> 02:49.687
because your only choice now

02:49.723 --> 02:51.556
is to fill me with lead.

02:51.591 --> 02:52.991
Oh, my gosh,
this is so hot.

02:53.026 --> 02:54.492
Louis, stay in character.

02:54.527 --> 02:55.393
I'm the burglar.

02:55.428 --> 02:56.361
I-I got it.

02:56.396 --> 02:59.263
And you're about to be
stripped clean.

02:59.299 --> 03:00.264
Yeah, I am.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.033
What are you gonna
make off with, you thief?

03:02.068 --> 03:03.568
My money?
My bonds? My jewels?

03:03.603 --> 03:06.404
Oh,
I'm after your jewels.

03:07.874 --> 03:09.540
And it looks like

03:09.576 --> 03:11.542
I found them!
- Holy shit.

03:11.578 --> 03:12.844
Sheila, I can't help it.

03:12.879 --> 03:14.090
I love it when you...
- Ah, ah, ah.

03:14.114 --> 03:15.446
Rule 29.

03:15.482 --> 03:17.181
No L word.

03:17.217 --> 03:18.182
I wasn't using it in...

03:19.986 --> 03:22.453
We were very clear
on the rules, Louis.

03:24.791 --> 03:26.891
We wrote the Bill of Badness.

03:26.926 --> 03:28.693
It outlined your
lack of rights,

03:28.728 --> 03:29.861
and you signed it.
- Sorry.

03:29.896 --> 03:30.973
I don't know what came over me.

03:30.997 --> 03:31.929
It's okay.
You're forgiven.

03:31.965 --> 03:32.797
But do it again,

03:32.832 --> 03:36.534
and next time,
we play prisoner... guard.

03:37.904 --> 03:39.437
Well, then,
I will do it again.

03:39.472 --> 03:40.438
Good,

03:40.473 --> 03:42.774
'cause I already got my Taser.

03:50.750 --> 03:51.827
Teddy, what are you
doing here?

03:51.851 --> 03:54.218
I thought you were off
sailing around the world.

03:54.254 --> 03:56.287
And I thought you were in
the office down the hall.

03:56.322 --> 03:58.990
Then I guess the news
didn't make it to Macau.

03:59.025 --> 04:00.992
Jessica's out.
I'm Managing Partner.

04:01.027 --> 04:03.528
Louis is number two,
and Donna's our new COO.

04:03.563 --> 04:05.563
Oh, glad to hear some people
still get rewarded

04:05.598 --> 04:07.065
for loyalty and hard work.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.210
- What does that mean?
- It means I got a call

04:08.234 --> 04:10.635
from the crew captain
at my old factory.

04:10.670 --> 04:12.748
Apparently, Adidas got an offer
they couldn't refuse,

04:12.772 --> 04:13.916
sold the company to
Kurt Baxter.

04:13.940 --> 04:15.440
Teddy, there's no way
that guy

04:15.475 --> 04:16.515
keeps your company intact.

04:16.543 --> 04:18.409
Why do you think I'm here?

04:18.445 --> 04:20.144
Baxter's gonna ship
all the labor overseas,

04:20.180 --> 04:22.113
which means my guys
are permanently out of work.

04:22.148 --> 04:23.481
I get that you want to
stop this,

04:23.516 --> 04:25.249
but you sold the company,

04:25.285 --> 04:27.151
and they sold it
to someone else.

04:27.187 --> 04:29.287
We don't have a legal leg
to stand on.

04:29.322 --> 04:31.522
Harvey, I built my company
on those guys' backs.

04:31.558 --> 04:33.791
I gave them my word
that they'd be protected.

04:33.827 --> 04:34.837
If I let them get tossed out,

04:34.861 --> 04:36.627
I'm as bad as Baxter.

04:36.663 --> 04:40.098
Now, I know I'm asking for
the impossible, but...

04:40.133 --> 04:42.233
isn't the impossible
what you do?

04:42.268 --> 04:44.097
All right, Teddy.
I'll see what I can do.

Hey,
whatever you're working on,

05:19.236 --> 05:20.435
what's the timeline?

05:20.471 --> 05:22.779
Uh, it's not urgent,
if that's what you're asking.

05:23.340 --> 05:25.607
So why are you asking?

05:25.642 --> 05:27.509
Teddy Doyle just came
to see me.

05:27.544 --> 05:28.977
I thought he retired.

05:29.012 --> 05:29.745
He did, but

05:29.780 --> 05:31.012
situation's come up,

05:31.048 --> 05:32.013
and he asked for my help.

05:32.049 --> 05:33.582
What kind of situation?

05:33.617 --> 05:34.983
The kind that includes
Kurt Baxter

05:35.018 --> 05:36.051
buying his old company

05:36.086 --> 05:37.919
and laying off
the whole factory.

05:37.955 --> 05:38.754
And if you're coming to me

05:38.789 --> 05:40.355
to stop Baxter from doing that,

05:40.391 --> 05:42.357
it must mean that there is
no way we can.

05:42.393 --> 05:43.470
Just like there was no way
for you

05:43.494 --> 05:44.604
to sue your own client
in a class action,

05:44.628 --> 05:47.028
or get into
the New York State Bar

05:47.064 --> 05:47.996
after going to prison.

05:48.031 --> 05:49.142
You're right, I do leap
tall buildings

05:49.166 --> 05:50.699
in a single bound.

05:50.734 --> 05:52.167
Good call,
coming to me for help.

05:52.202 --> 05:53.702
That's why I'm
Managing Partner.

05:53.737 --> 05:55.637
Harvey, why doesn't Teddy
just buy his company

05:55.672 --> 05:57.539
back from this bastard,
call it a day?

05:57.574 --> 06:00.008
Because Teddy sold it
for 200,

06:00.043 --> 06:01.576
Baxter wants 500,

06:01.612 --> 06:04.045
and unless you got
an extra 300 mil laying around,

06:04.081 --> 06:06.481
he doesn't have the money.
- Well, that's it.

06:06.517 --> 06:07.616
What do you got?

06:07.651 --> 06:08.962
Baxter doesn't care
where he makes his money from.

06:08.986 --> 06:11.052
He just cares that it's green.

06:11.088 --> 06:11.853
So we need to figure out

06:11.889 --> 06:12.821
how to make more money

06:12.856 --> 06:15.056
keeping the factory open
than closed,

06:15.092 --> 06:16.358
and those workers are safe.

06:16.393 --> 06:18.405
And I might still have time
to fly around the city tonight.

06:18.429 --> 06:20.061
You know I'm not just
gonna let you

06:20.097 --> 06:22.342
keep calling yourself Superman
and get away with it, right?

06:22.366 --> 06:24.366
Because that only leaves you
with Aquaman?

06:24.401 --> 06:26.468
He can breathe underwater.

06:26.503 --> 06:28.637
All right, fine, Harvey.
You can still be Batman.

06:28.672 --> 06:31.072
Or Green Lantern,
or Wonder Woman.

06:31.108 --> 06:33.842
I can just keep doing this.
How about Hawkman, huh?

06:34.978 --> 06:36.745
Okay.
The Silent Man it is.

06:39.950 --> 06:41.349
Gretchen.

06:43.954 --> 06:45.921
What are you
bellowing about now?

06:45.956 --> 06:47.333
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the fact that

06:47.357 --> 06:49.691
I'm sitting here with
a freshly blended prunie,

06:49.726 --> 06:51.538
30 minutes to myself,
and no morning newspaper?

06:51.562 --> 06:53.773
That's because when I went
to get you one, they were out.

06:53.797 --> 06:54.763
Well, then,
why don't you go to

06:54.798 --> 06:56.264
the newsstand down the street?

06:56.300 --> 06:57.265
'Cause I'm your secretary,
Louis,

06:57.301 --> 06:58.545
not the paper boy,
and that's that.

06:58.569 --> 07:01.203
No, that is not that,
because a day hasn't gone by

07:01.238 --> 07:03.216
that I haven't read
the newspaper since I was nine.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.172
So if it's all the same to you,

07:04.208 --> 07:05.874
I'll go out and
find one myself.

07:05.909 --> 07:08.343
Louis, wait.
They had the paper.

07:08.378 --> 07:09.911
I just didn't want you
to see it.

07:09.947 --> 07:10.947
Why not?

07:10.981 --> 07:12.881
Because there's an
announcement in there, Louis.

07:12.916 --> 07:14.783
That Sazs woman's
getting married

07:14.818 --> 07:16.117
in less than a week.

07:16.153 --> 07:17.619
I know that, Gretchen,

07:17.654 --> 07:19.788
and I appreciate your concern,

07:19.823 --> 07:21.690
but I've accepted
that she is moving on,

07:21.725 --> 07:22.791
and so am I.

07:22.826 --> 07:24.926
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go downstairs

07:24.962 --> 07:26.361
and get the newspaper.

07:26.396 --> 07:28.029
You're still tapping that,
aren't you?

07:28.065 --> 07:29.431
Say what?

07:29.466 --> 07:30.643
Don't lie to me.
You got a big old grin

07:30.667 --> 07:32.968
one second after mentioning
that woman moving on.

07:33.003 --> 07:35.203
- It was not a grin.
- I don't care what it was.

07:35.239 --> 07:36.071
You're dipping your pudding pop

07:36.106 --> 07:37.116
in someone else's candy cane.

07:37.140 --> 07:38.907
That doesn't even
make any sense.

07:38.942 --> 07:41.409
Louis Jr.'s having himself
a slumber party.

07:41.445 --> 07:42.377
Okay, please do not
call him that.

07:42.412 --> 07:43.912
Johnny-ready-to-go's

07:43.947 --> 07:45.058
snazzing round
the neighborhood.

07:45.082 --> 07:46.882
All right, fine!
So what if I am?

07:46.917 --> 07:48.717
So nothing.

07:48.752 --> 07:50.330
So you're not gonna tell me
that this is a huge mistake?

07:50.354 --> 07:51.831
It's a mistake, but since
you're already making it,

07:51.855 --> 07:53.288
we might as well skip the part

07:53.323 --> 07:54.400
where I tell you
that you're crazy

07:54.424 --> 07:56.958
and get to the part
where disaster ensues.

07:56.994 --> 07:58.894
It's not going to ensue,
Gretchen,

07:58.929 --> 08:00.295
because I know what I'm doing

08:00.330 --> 08:02.597
and I can live
with my decision.

08:02.633 --> 08:04.344
You know, I don't even
need the newspaper anymore,

08:04.368 --> 08:05.233
so if you don't mind,

08:05.269 --> 08:06.968
I'm gonna finish up
my prunie

08:07.004 --> 08:08.270
and I'm gonna make plans

08:08.305 --> 08:09.415
for my slumber party
with my pudding pop.

08:14.111 --> 08:15.577
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:15.612 --> 08:16.856
Do you mind if I ask
what you're working on?

08:16.880 --> 08:17.924
Uh, actually,
I'm in the middle of

08:17.948 --> 08:20.749
doing the impossible
for Harvey.

08:20.784 --> 08:23.585
But doing the impossible
is not gonna keep me out of

08:23.620 --> 08:25.620
Father Walker's office
at 7:00 p.m. tonight,

08:25.656 --> 08:26.766
which is exactly what you
came in here to remind me of.

08:26.790 --> 08:28.067
You think you know me
so well, don't you?

08:28.091 --> 08:30.659
Some might say better than
you know yourself.

08:30.694 --> 08:31.726
Okay, then tell me,

08:31.762 --> 08:34.195
what am I going to ask you
right now?

08:34.231 --> 08:35.797
"How'd you get
so damn handsome?"

08:35.832 --> 08:37.532
"Have you been working out?"

08:37.568 --> 08:39.366
"Tell me the truth:
is it the working out

08:39.403 --> 08:40.335
that's made you
so damn handsome?"

08:40.370 --> 08:42.136
- Mike...
- You're about to ask me

08:42.172 --> 08:44.439
if I've had time to get to
the questionnaire yet,

08:44.474 --> 08:48.977
and I haven't,
but it is right... here.

08:49.012 --> 08:51.880
- Mike, Father Walker said
it's important

08:51.915 --> 08:54.215
for each of us to write down
what we want as a couple

08:54.251 --> 08:55.650
and where we see
our lives going.

08:55.686 --> 08:57.485
- I know,
which is why I promise

08:57.521 --> 08:59.020
to have it filled out
by tonight.

09:00.257 --> 09:01.556
- Thank you.

09:06.229 --> 09:07.562
- Well?

09:07.598 --> 09:08.363
- Well, what?

09:08.398 --> 09:09.631
- You got something?

09:09.666 --> 09:10.532
- Let me get this straight.

09:10.567 --> 09:12.167
You asked me to do
the impossible,

09:12.202 --> 09:13.034
and then 15 seconds later,

09:13.070 --> 09:13.935
you just assume

09:13.971 --> 09:15.704
I came up with
a brilliant idea?

09:15.739 --> 09:16.571
- So you came
all the way down here

09:16.607 --> 09:18.173
to tell me
you got nothing?

09:18.208 --> 09:19.419
- Would I do that?
- You've done it before.

09:19.443 --> 09:23.211
- And I'll do it again,
but not today.

09:27.618 --> 09:28.750
- It's good, Mike.

09:28.785 --> 09:31.519
Did you do it yet,
or did you just think of it?

09:31.555 --> 09:32.587
- It's done.

09:32.623 --> 09:34.255
- How'd you manage that?

09:34.291 --> 09:36.424
- Well, I went back to
my roots.

09:36.460 --> 09:38.426
People love Teddy.
They care about him.

09:38.462 --> 09:40.261
I decided to use that
to our advantage.

09:40.297 --> 09:41.062
- That's good.

09:41.098 --> 09:42.564
It's what I'd do.

09:42.599 --> 09:43.932
- Then why didn't you?

09:43.967 --> 09:45.400
- And miss out on all of this?

09:45.435 --> 09:46.779
- Yeah, this isn't so good,
you know.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.436
- You say that now,
but someday,

09:48.472 --> 09:50.271
you're gonna miss me, buddy.
Trust me.

09:50.307 --> 09:52.407
- Am I?
- Nothing lasts forever.

09:53.477 --> 09:54.676
Come on.

09:54.711 --> 09:55.777
Let's go save some jobs.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.078
- I love this part.

10:01.385 --> 10:02.517
<i>- Louis,</i>

10:02.552 --> 10:04.519
I thought we agreed
you can't call me here.

10:04.554 --> 10:05.765
<i>- I don't care</i>
<i>what we agreed on.</i>

10:05.789 --> 10:08.056
<i>I want you, and I'm not</i>
<i>gonna be denied.</i>

10:08.091 --> 10:09.724
- What?

10:09.760 --> 10:10.925
- You heard me.

10:10.961 --> 10:13.194
My neighborhood watch
won't be on patrol

10:13.230 --> 10:14.396
tomorrow night,

10:14.431 --> 10:16.131
and I'm prime for
another break-in.

10:16.166 --> 10:17.899
- Okay, Louis,

10:17.934 --> 10:20.802
as much as your
lack of security excites me,

10:20.837 --> 10:22.537
<i>I can't tomorrow.</i>

10:22.572 --> 10:23.772
<i>I have to work.</i>

10:23.807 --> 10:25.218
- Well, then watch out
for the janitor,

10:25.242 --> 10:26.174
because he's coming
to clean your office,

10:26.209 --> 10:27.375
and it's very, very dirty.

10:27.411 --> 10:28.243
- Louis, I can't.

10:28.278 --> 10:30.545
I need to review
some application files

10:30.580 --> 10:31.446
since I got to work late

10:31.481 --> 10:33.281
this morning.

10:33.316 --> 10:34.649
- You negligent hussy.

10:34.685 --> 10:36.284
Sounds like someone
needs a spanking.

10:36.319 --> 10:38.398
- Louis, this bad boy thing
is really working for you.

10:38.422 --> 10:39.287
<i>- Call me "Louis" again,</i>

10:39.322 --> 10:40.555
and I'm gonna smack that a--

10:40.590 --> 10:42.090
- Oh, my God,

10:42.125 --> 10:43.125
this is so powerful.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.203
<i>- In that case,</i>
<i>forget the janitor.</i>

10:44.227 --> 10:45.126
The Dean of Admissions

10:45.162 --> 10:46.895
is coming to check on your work

10:46.930 --> 10:48.063
tomorrow night, Miss Sazs.

10:48.098 --> 10:49.798
- Ah.

10:49.833 --> 10:51.966
You mean Dean Hans
Von Schlongenhammer?

10:52.002 --> 10:53.312
<i>I see you heard of me,</i>

10:53.336 --> 10:57.072
and those papers
better be in order, Miss Sazs,

10:57.107 --> 10:59.908
or you're going to get a hammer
from the schlongen.

10:59.943 --> 11:01.843
<i>- Well, in that case,</i>
<i>I will be unprepared</i>

11:01.878 --> 11:03.778
<i>for an inspection</i>
<i>at 8:30 sharp.</i>

11:03.814 --> 11:05.258
Wait, can we make it 7:30?

11:05.282 --> 11:06.659
Because I have a prostate exam
in the morning.

11:08.385 --> 11:10.652
- What do you think?

11:10.687 --> 11:11.920
- It's a hell of a view.

11:11.955 --> 11:13.088
- Better be.

11:13.123 --> 11:15.256
Remember that building
on the corner of 57th?

11:15.292 --> 11:16.324
It was blocking the park,

11:16.359 --> 11:17.926
so I bought it,
then I tore it down.

11:17.961 --> 11:18.860
- Is that what you
plan on doing

11:18.895 --> 11:21.262
with Teddy Doyle's company?

11:21.298 --> 11:23.031
- It's not Teddy Doyle's
company--it's mine.

11:23.066 --> 11:24.532
Now what can I do
for you gentlemen?

11:24.568 --> 11:25.645
- Actually,
it's more of an issue

11:25.669 --> 11:26.868
of what we can do for you.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.636
- Then get to the point.

11:28.672 --> 11:29.749
- We know that
you're planning on

11:29.773 --> 11:31.973
shipping those
manufacturing jobs overseas.

11:32.008 --> 11:33.875
What if we told you that
instead of doing that,

11:33.910 --> 11:36.478
we'd cut a deal
with Teddy's old suppliers

11:36.513 --> 11:38.146
that would lower your costs
by 30%

11:38.181 --> 11:40.615
in exchange for
a five-year contract?

11:40.650 --> 11:42.984
- I'd say thanks,
but no thanks.

11:43.019 --> 11:43.985
- Did you hear what I said?

11:44.020 --> 11:47.021
That would increase
your cash flow by 80%.

11:47.057 --> 11:48.156
- So what?

11:48.191 --> 11:49.302
- Kurt, I understand you not
giving a shit about people

11:49.326 --> 11:51.126
when it makes you money,

11:51.161 --> 11:53.228
but not doing this
costs you money.

11:53.263 --> 11:54.263
- No, it doesn't,

11:54.297 --> 11:56.498
because I don't just want
more cash flow.

11:56.533 --> 11:57.565
I wanna sell the company,

11:57.601 --> 11:59.134
and China's not gonna buy it

11:59.169 --> 12:00.668
unless those jobs
come along with it.

12:00.704 --> 12:01.748
- Well, if you just
wanna sell,

12:01.772 --> 12:03.872
then why the hell'd
we take this meeting?

12:03.907 --> 12:05.974
- Because I didn't think
the mighty Harvey Specter's

12:06.009 --> 12:08.243
going to come down here,
groveling for a few jobs.

12:08.278 --> 12:10.745
I thought he was going to come
down here to match their price,

12:10.781 --> 12:12.347
because I'll let you in
on a secret.

12:12.382 --> 12:13.882
Paying me what I want

12:13.917 --> 12:15.817
is the only way those jobs
are staying here.

12:18.855 --> 12:20.255
Enjoy the view.

12:24.532 --> 12:26.633
- Harvey, listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

12:26.668 --> 12:27.764
I'm not gonna stop because

12:27.765 --> 12:30.769
some asshole with a view
wants a bidding war.

12:30.770 --> 12:31.936
We'll find another way.

12:31.971 --> 12:32.937
That was the other way.

12:32.972 --> 12:34.483
Harvey, I know that
Teddy's your friend,

12:34.507 --> 12:35.473
but he walked away.

12:35.508 --> 12:36.307
And he wouldn't have
done that

12:36.342 --> 12:37.961
if he'd known those workers

12:37.962 --> 12:39.593
wouldn't be able to
feed their families.

12:39.594 --> 12:41.494
You, of all people,
should relate to that.

12:41.529 --> 12:43.262
And you, of all people,
know that emotion

12:43.297 --> 12:44.263
shouldn't be mixed
with business.

12:44.298 --> 12:46.565
You two want to let me in
on what's going on?

12:46.601 --> 12:47.900
Donna, I don't have time to--

12:47.935 --> 12:49.113
Teddy caught me up on
what's happening, Harvey,

12:49.137 --> 12:51.670
including the fact that
he asked you to do something

12:51.706 --> 12:52.905
you have no standing to do,

12:52.940 --> 12:53.951
so I'm here to find out
what you're getting us into.

12:53.975 --> 12:56.408
There's nothing
to get into, Donna,

12:56.444 --> 12:58.188
because unless Teddy
suddenly finds enough money

12:58.212 --> 12:59.879
to match the Chinese,
it's over.

12:59.914 --> 13:01.313
Unless he doesn't need
more money.

13:01.349 --> 13:02.848
What the hell
are you talking about?

13:02.884 --> 13:04.583
I'm saying we push the price
back down

13:04.619 --> 13:05.951
to what Teddy sold it for

13:05.987 --> 13:07.097
and we get Stu Buzzini
to help us do it.

13:07.121 --> 13:08.532
You're talking about
shorting his stock.

13:08.556 --> 13:10.656
You think Baxter hasn't done

13:10.691 --> 13:12.057
the same thing
a thousand times?

13:12.093 --> 13:13.403
I don't care how many times
he's done it.

13:13.427 --> 13:15.027
Putting downward pressure
on a stock

13:15.062 --> 13:16.962
just to help a takeover attempt
is illegal.

13:16.998 --> 13:18.430
We can't ask Stu to do that.

13:18.466 --> 13:20.299
It's not illegal.
Nobody's going to jail.

13:20.334 --> 13:21.400
It's a civil violation.

13:21.435 --> 13:23.569
All we have to do
is convince Stu of that.

13:23.604 --> 13:25.204
And how exactly
are we gonna do that?

13:25.239 --> 13:26.239
We go to Louis.

13:26.274 --> 13:27.072
Stu trusts him,
and he's an expert

13:27.108 --> 13:29.408
on Securities Law.

13:29.443 --> 13:30.809
Harvey, this isn't
a good idea.

13:30.845 --> 13:32.222
You don't have to get Louis.
I'll do it.

13:32.246 --> 13:33.323
- Donna--
- Harvey, I know Stu.

13:33.347 --> 13:35.381
This isn't about convincing him

13:35.416 --> 13:36.482
with legal arguments.

13:36.517 --> 13:37.628
This is about
appealing to him personally,

13:37.652 --> 13:39.885
and nobody here can do that
better than me.

13:39.921 --> 13:40.886
Donna,

13:40.922 --> 13:41.999
you sure you want to do this?

13:42.023 --> 13:43.367
I'm sure I've seen
that look in Harvey's eye,

13:43.391 --> 13:45.958
which means someone's gonna do
it, whether I like it or not,

13:45.993 --> 13:47.126
and I'm also sure,

13:47.161 --> 13:48.861
if anybody can convince Stu,

13:48.896 --> 13:50.129
it's me.

13:52.637 --> 13:54.270
Gretchen! Hi.

13:54.305 --> 13:54.904
However long

13:54.939 --> 13:56.472
300 collated copies

13:56.507 --> 13:57.273
of Miller v. Georgia takes,

13:57.308 --> 13:58.808
that's how long I'll be.

13:58.843 --> 14:01.039
That's not what
I was going to ask.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.442
I wanted to know
if Louis is seeing someone.

14:04.619 --> 14:05.785
Say what now?

14:05.820 --> 14:07.320
If he isn't seeing someone,

14:07.355 --> 14:08.732
then I don't want to
make him feel badly

14:08.756 --> 14:09.909
by including a plus-one,

14:09.910 --> 14:11.238
but if he is seeing someone,

14:11.239 --> 14:12.205
then I don't want to be rude

14:12.240 --> 14:14.474
by not including a plus-one.

14:14.509 --> 14:17.644
Oh, he's seeing someone,
all right.

14:17.679 --> 14:18.645
What does that mean?

14:18.680 --> 14:19.712
W-What now?
I forgot

14:19.748 --> 14:21.714
your original question.
- No, no, no,

14:21.750 --> 14:22.994
you just said
he's seeing someone

14:23.018 --> 14:25.718
in a way that clearly means
you know something.

14:25.754 --> 14:27.453
I'm sorry,
I can't hear you

14:27.489 --> 14:30.857
over this rickety copier.

14:32.227 --> 14:34.827
So that's how this
is gonna be, huh?

14:34.863 --> 14:37.930
What are you not telling me?

14:37.966 --> 14:39.632
Louis is sleeping with
Sheila Sazs

14:39.668 --> 14:41.100
behind her fiancé's back.

14:41.136 --> 14:43.703
I told him he was crazy.

14:43.738 --> 14:44.837
God only knows what goes on

14:44.873 --> 14:47.006
in that man's soul.

14:47.042 --> 14:48.808
Now can you plug that thing
back in, please?

14:48.843 --> 14:50.877
I got copying to do.

14:58.707 --> 15:00.106
Didn't anyone ever tell you

15:00.142 --> 15:02.676
that staring at screens
is bad for the eyes?

15:02.711 --> 15:03.755
Didn't anyone ever tell you

15:03.779 --> 15:05.278
that you're good for the eyes?

15:05.314 --> 15:07.013
Only every day.

15:07.049 --> 15:08.559
It's good to see you, Donna.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

15:08.583 --> 15:11.051
I'm here to discuss
a business opportunity.

15:11.086 --> 15:12.363
Then I'm all ears,
because the last time

15:12.387 --> 15:14.587
you came to me with
one of those, I made a killing.

15:14.623 --> 15:15.833
Well, then get ready
to make another one

15:15.857 --> 15:19.259
by shorting Doyle Shoes.

15:19.294 --> 15:20.894
Doyle Shoes is about
to be sold at

15:20.929 --> 15:22.062
an 80% premium.

15:22.097 --> 15:22.962
Is it?

15:22.998 --> 15:24.331
Okay, what's going on here,
Donna?

15:24.366 --> 15:25.410
What do you know that I don't?

15:25.434 --> 15:27.033
I know that if you short
that stock,

15:27.069 --> 15:28.468
you'll make a fortune,

15:28.503 --> 15:30.236
and a good man
will get his company back.

15:30.272 --> 15:32.216
And driving a stock price
down to help with a takeover

15:32.240 --> 15:33.273
is an SEC violation.

15:33.872 --> 15:35.577
It's a risk to make money.
It's what you do.

15:35.578 --> 15:37.622
Not that kind of risk.
Not my license.

15:37.623 --> 15:38.558
And keeping your license

15:38.559 --> 15:39.624
won't stop you

15:39.659 --> 15:40.959
from being dethroned.

15:40.994 --> 15:42.460
You say my guys
are coming after me?

15:42.496 --> 15:44.062
Look around.

15:44.097 --> 15:45.730
Every single one of these guys

15:45.765 --> 15:48.733
is a young you,
looking to take you down.

15:48.768 --> 15:50.335
Traders are gunslingers, Stu,

15:50.370 --> 15:51.614
and gunslingers
don't follow people

15:51.638 --> 15:53.638
who never sling a gun.

15:53.673 --> 15:55.451
You guarantee I'm gonna make
a ton of money on this

15:55.475 --> 15:57.709
and not get caught?
- I'm not gonna lie to you.

15:57.744 --> 15:58.643
You might lose your license,

15:58.678 --> 15:59.644
but like I said,

15:59.679 --> 16:01.513
you're not in this
for the money,

16:01.548 --> 16:03.781
and sooner or later,
you stop taking risks,

16:03.817 --> 16:05.450
you're not gonna
be king anymore.

16:13.560 --> 16:14.826
Mom, hey.

16:14.861 --> 16:16.294
<i>Am I interrupting?</i>

16:16.329 --> 16:18.029
No, I'm just doing some work.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.997
Well, I'm just getting ready
to come down there.

16:20.033 --> 16:20.932
You coming to the city?

16:20.967 --> 16:22.633
<i>Yeah, just for tonight.</i>

16:22.944 --> 16:24.176
I know it's last-minute,

16:24.212 --> 16:26.445
but I was hoping you might be
available for dinner.

16:26.481 --> 16:27.346
<i>Dinner?</i>

16:27.381 --> 16:28.481
Yeah, you know,

16:28.516 --> 16:30.382
the meal people usually eat in
the evening?

16:30.734 --> 16:31.978
Yeah, I know what dinner is,
Mom.

16:33.670 --> 16:35.570
<i>Would you like to have some?</i>

16:35.605 --> 16:36.938
Of course I would.
It's just that

16:36.973 --> 16:39.121
I have plans tonight with
the woman I've been seeing,

16:39.122 --> 16:40.867
and we've just gone through
a little something,

16:40.891 --> 16:42.157
and I--
<i>- Say no more, Harvey.</i>

16:42.192 --> 16:44.492
Just tell me her name
in case I talk to Marcus.

16:44.528 --> 16:47.462
It'll be fun to have the scoop
on him.

16:47.497 --> 16:49.264
Her name's Paula, Mom.

16:51.268 --> 16:53.001
Why don't you join us?

16:53.036 --> 16:54.036
Are you sure?

16:54.083 --> 16:55.682
<i>Yeah, I'd love to have you,</i>

16:55.718 --> 16:57.301
and uh, I'm sure she would,
too.

16:57.302 --> 16:58.234
<i>Then I'd love to.</i>

16:58.269 --> 17:00.203
<i>Just tell me where and when.</i>

17:02.474 --> 17:04.140
Louis.

17:04.175 --> 17:05.407
Do you have a minute?

17:05.443 --> 17:06.443
For you, Rachel,

17:06.478 --> 17:08.277
always.
What's on your mind?

17:08.313 --> 17:10.346
Well, I was just
on my way out,

17:10.382 --> 17:12.848
and I don't really know
how to say this,

17:12.884 --> 17:15.151
but--
- Rachel, what's going on?

17:15.185 --> 17:16.386
Okay, look.

17:19.758 --> 17:20.857
I don't know if

17:20.892 --> 17:23.393
you're seeing anyone right now,
or not,

17:23.428 --> 17:26.529
but I just wanted you
to know that

17:26.564 --> 17:28.164
no matter who it is,

17:28.199 --> 17:29.732
if they make you happy,

17:29.768 --> 17:31.267
then they are more than welcome

17:31.302 --> 17:33.403
to come to our wedding.

17:33.438 --> 17:34.904
Gretchen told you,
didn't she?

17:34.939 --> 17:35.983
Yeah, she may have told me.

17:36.007 --> 17:37.740
But Louis, you were the one
that told me

17:37.776 --> 17:39.475
that Sheila came to you
in the first place,

17:39.511 --> 17:41.110
and I told you then

17:41.146 --> 17:42.578
that no matter
what you decided,

17:42.614 --> 17:44.458
it wasn't going to change
the way I feel about you,

17:44.482 --> 17:47.250
and I just want you to know
that it hasn't.

17:47.285 --> 17:49.152
Um, Rachel,
I appreciate that,

17:49.187 --> 17:52.522
but Sheila and I
can't be seen in public,

17:52.557 --> 17:54.657
and to tell you the truth,

17:54.692 --> 17:56.125
I wouldn't change that.

17:56.161 --> 17:58.394
- You wouldn't?
- No.

17:58.430 --> 18:01.230
In fact, for the first time
in my life,

18:01.266 --> 18:03.499
I have confidence.

18:03.535 --> 18:05.168
I feel like a king.

18:05.203 --> 18:07.003
Well...

18:07.724 --> 18:09.924
Louis, it is my pleasure
to inform you

18:09.960 --> 18:12.060
that I officially rescind

18:12.095 --> 18:13.728
your plus-one.

18:13.764 --> 18:14.996
Thank you, Rachel.

18:15.031 --> 18:16.865
I appreciate you understanding.

18:22.606 --> 18:23.872
Well, hello, you.

18:23.907 --> 18:25.707
<i>- Am I interrupting?</i>
- No.

18:26.144 --> 18:27.455
I was just finishing up
my notes for the night.

18:27.479 --> 18:29.212
Good, because
there's something

18:29.247 --> 18:30.947
I want to ask you.

18:30.982 --> 18:32.182
<i>What is it?</i>

18:32.217 --> 18:33.149
I know that tonight

18:33.185 --> 18:35.076
was supposed to be
just for us,

18:35.077 --> 18:38.445
but my mom's gonna be in town
for the night,

18:38.480 --> 18:41.481
and I was hoping that
maybe she could join us.

18:41.517 --> 18:44.585
Harvey, I'd love to
just say yes, but...

18:44.620 --> 18:46.386
<i>What is it?</i>

18:46.422 --> 18:47.465
Well, having dinner
with your mother

18:47.489 --> 18:49.790
would be a big thing,

18:49.825 --> 18:51.925
and we just went through
a big thing.

18:51.961 --> 18:53.794
That thing
wasn't a good thing.

18:53.829 --> 18:55.596
This would be.
<i>- I know--it's just,</i>

18:55.631 --> 18:57.008
are you sure this is
the perfect time?

18:57.032 --> 18:58.999
<i>Paula, I may not have</i>

18:59.034 --> 19:00.534
<i>a lot of experience</i>
<i>in this arena,</i>

19:00.569 --> 19:02.269
but is there such a thing
as a perfect time

19:02.304 --> 19:03.604
to meet someone's mother?

19:03.639 --> 19:04.605
<i>No, you're right.</i>

19:04.640 --> 19:06.607
<i>Of course she can join us.</i>

19:06.642 --> 19:08.075
Now I have to go.

19:08.110 --> 19:09.521
I need to figure out
what I'm gonna wear.

19:09.545 --> 19:11.478
<i>Wear the dress</i>
<i>with the thing.</i>

19:11.513 --> 19:13.247
<i>She'll love it.</i>

19:13.282 --> 19:14.681
How do you know?

19:14.717 --> 19:15.849
Because I love it.

19:15.885 --> 19:18.151
<i>I'm looking forward to it,</i>
<i>Harvey.</i>

19:18.187 --> 19:20.854
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

19:20.890 --> 19:21.622
Harvey.

19:21.657 --> 19:23.557
Baxter's on the phone,
line two.

19:23.592 --> 19:24.491
What do you mean,
line two?

19:24.526 --> 19:26.126
What are you,
my secretary now?

19:26.161 --> 19:27.539
He called me.
I transferred it to you.

19:27.563 --> 19:28.295
I thought we could
do this together.

19:28.330 --> 19:29.496
You know how to transfer?

19:29.531 --> 19:30.631
How'd they teach you that?

19:30.666 --> 19:31.498
I always drop the call.

19:31.533 --> 19:33.100
Okay, well,
he's gonna drop the call

19:33.135 --> 19:34.335
if you don't pick up line two.

19:34.573 --> 19:35.931
Kurt, it's Harvey Specter.

19:35.932 --> 19:37.365
How are you?
What can I do for you?

19:37.400 --> 19:40.067
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

19:40.103 --> 19:42.036
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

19:42.071 --> 19:43.349
<i>Bullshit.</i>
<i>You're trying to tank my stock</i>

19:43.373 --> 19:44.271
<i>and make my sale go away.</i>

19:44.307 --> 19:46.407
Kurt, Mike Ross again.

19:46.442 --> 19:49.110
Listen, we have no knowledge
of that, but if we did,

19:49.145 --> 19:50.322
<i>I think we'd just be</i>
<i>taking a page</i>

19:50.346 --> 19:51.212
<i>from the Kurt Baxter playbook.</i>

19:51.247 --> 19:52.013
You really think this is

19:52.048 --> 19:54.048
gonna work on me, huh?

19:54.083 --> 19:55.983
What I think is,
you're a smart man

19:56.019 --> 19:57.618
who knows when
to cut his losses

19:57.654 --> 19:58.998
and take the deal
that's on the table.

19:59.022 --> 20:00.809
<i>And what the hell deal</i>
<i>is that?</i>

20:00.810 --> 20:02.439
As I see it,
you got two deals.

20:02.440 --> 20:03.878
<i>You could take</i>
<i>the supplier deal</i>

20:03.879 --> 20:04.978
<i>Mike and I made for you</i>

20:05.014 --> 20:07.347
<i>and put a small fortune</i>
<i>in your pocket...</i>

20:07.383 --> 20:08.915
- Or.
<i>- Or you can take</i>

20:08.951 --> 20:09.916
the $200 million

20:09.952 --> 20:11.585
that our client
is prepared to offer

20:11.620 --> 20:13.287
for controlling interest
in his company,

20:13.322 --> 20:14.855
and you can keep the 30%.

20:14.890 --> 20:15.622
<i>You sons of bitches.</i>

20:15.658 --> 20:17.157
That is blackmail,

20:17.192 --> 20:18.025
and I'm not gonna let you
get away with it.

20:18.060 --> 20:19.226
<i>And if you want the SEC</i>

20:19.261 --> 20:20.505
<i>to go through your books</i>
<i>with a fine-toothed comb</i>

20:20.529 --> 20:21.128
<i>to make your case,</i>

20:21.163 --> 20:23.764
<i>you go right ahead,</i>

20:23.799 --> 20:25.432
but this offer
isn't gonna last forever,

20:25.467 --> 20:26.366
so in the meantime,

20:26.402 --> 20:29.036
my client's got financing
to arrange.

20:29.071 --> 20:30.671
All right, Baxter's gonna
have to

20:30.706 --> 20:32.017
wait till tomorrow.
I've got plans.

20:32.041 --> 20:33.640
Uh, me too.
What do you have going on?

20:33.676 --> 20:35.175
You're never gonna
believe this.

20:35.210 --> 20:37.778
I've got dinner with
my mother and Paula.

20:37.813 --> 20:39.346
- Oh.
- How about you?

20:39.381 --> 20:41.548
I have a sit-down with Rachel
and Father Walker.

20:41.583 --> 20:42.516
You wanna trade places?

20:42.551 --> 20:44.151
You do mine, I'll do yours.

20:44.186 --> 20:45.897
Tell you the truth,
I'm looking forward to mine.

20:45.921 --> 20:46.965
Wow, you are so not the guy

20:46.989 --> 20:48.522
that I said would never have

20:48.557 --> 20:49.990
a lasting relationship
of any kind.

20:50.025 --> 20:51.625
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

20:51.660 --> 20:52.759
Kind of is.

20:52.795 --> 20:54.695
Ah, you miss your buddy.

20:54.730 --> 20:56.007
- Ha, ha.
- Is that what this is?

20:56.031 --> 20:58.999
Shut up.
Go to your stupid dinner.

21:00.096 --> 21:01.797
So I know that they said

21:01.832 --> 21:04.145
we shouldn't
look at each other's answers

21:04.146 --> 21:05.334
until Father Walker's here,

21:05.335 --> 21:07.470
but I'll show you mine

21:07.471 --> 21:09.425
if you show me yours.

21:09.606 --> 21:12.974
Rachel, I didn't fill it out.

21:13.010 --> 21:14.320
What do you mean,
you didn't fill it out?

21:14.344 --> 21:16.211
I mean, I read it
and I thought about it

21:16.246 --> 21:18.177
like I said I would, but when
I tried to fill it out--

21:18.178 --> 21:19.418
Mike, what's the matter
with you

21:19.446 --> 21:21.646
that you can't take the time
to fill out a form?

21:21.682 --> 21:23.248
It wasn't about the time.

21:23.283 --> 21:24.927
I didn't fill it out because
I can't answer

21:24.951 --> 21:25.684
questions about the future

21:25.719 --> 21:27.585
because... I don't know

21:27.621 --> 21:28.665
what I want.
I'm not a planner.

21:28.689 --> 21:29.821
Well, I am,

21:29.856 --> 21:30.689
and when I looked at it,

21:30.724 --> 21:32.323
I realized that I have spent

21:32.359 --> 21:33.725
so much time worrying about

21:33.760 --> 21:35.326
trying to
keep you out of prison

21:35.362 --> 21:36.327
and how to get into the Bar

21:36.363 --> 21:37.373
that I never stopped to wonder

21:37.397 --> 21:38.897
if we really want
the same thing.

21:38.932 --> 21:39.664
Okay, so then what if I say

21:39.700 --> 21:41.066
I want whatever you want?

21:41.101 --> 21:41.803
I'd say if you
really wanted that,

21:41.804 --> 21:43.202
you would have put it
on the form.

21:45.940 --> 21:48.007
Did I interrupt something?

21:48.042 --> 21:49.353
Would you like me
to give you a few minutes?

21:49.377 --> 21:50.243
No.

21:50.278 --> 21:51.455
I'd say we're here
for counseling,

21:51.479 --> 21:54.680
it looks like
we could use some.

21:54.716 --> 21:56.582
Let me guess.

21:56.618 --> 21:57.618
You two don't want

21:57.652 --> 21:59.385
exactly the same things
out of life.

21:59.420 --> 22:01.120
Worse than that,
we don't know what we want

22:01.155 --> 22:03.422
because Mike didn't fill out
the form.

22:03.458 --> 22:04.423
And why is that?

22:04.459 --> 22:05.536
Because answering questions
about the future

22:05.560 --> 22:07.627
makes me feel locked in.

22:07.662 --> 22:08.706
Okay, but see, this is what
I don't understand.

22:08.730 --> 22:10.129
You're locked into me.

22:10.164 --> 22:11.964
And I love
being locked into you.

22:12.000 --> 22:12.865
All I'm saying is,

22:12.901 --> 22:14.267
why can't we just
live our lives

22:14.302 --> 22:15.902
for a while
and see what happens?

22:15.937 --> 22:18.704
Good.

22:18.740 --> 22:20.873
What do you mean, good?

22:20.909 --> 22:22.208
I mean, there's a reason

22:22.243 --> 22:24.610
we start with
these questionnaires,

22:24.646 --> 22:25.646
and the truth is,

22:25.680 --> 22:27.313
the couples that
I worry about the most

22:27.348 --> 22:29.482
are the ones that seem to have
the same answers

22:29.517 --> 22:31.918
to every single question.

22:31.953 --> 22:33.953
So you're saying we win
because we fight?

22:33.988 --> 22:34.988
No, I'm saying you win

22:35.023 --> 22:37.123
because you're honest
with each other.

22:39.093 --> 22:41.994
And I think we're done
for the night.

22:42.030 --> 22:43.996
But we've barely
done anything.

22:44.032 --> 22:45.898
Rachel, he's letting us
out of school.

22:45.934 --> 22:46.832
Don't ask for homework.

22:46.868 --> 22:47.566
Ah, I didn't say
there wouldn't be

22:47.602 --> 22:49.735
any homework, Michael,

22:49.771 --> 22:50.603
and before next time,

22:50.638 --> 22:52.271
I hope you find some ways

22:52.307 --> 22:53.606
to talk about the future

22:53.641 --> 22:54.674
without feeling

22:54.709 --> 22:55.975
locked into an outcome.

23:01.649 --> 23:02.782
And then,

23:02.817 --> 23:04.917
he just climbed up on the piano

23:04.953 --> 23:06.686
and started singing.
- No, no.

23:06.721 --> 23:08.120
Yeah. Six years old.

23:08.156 --> 23:09.466
Right in the middle
of the dinner party.

23:09.490 --> 23:11.190
My goodness.
What did you do?

23:11.225 --> 23:12.591
Well, the only thing
we could do.

23:12.627 --> 23:13.793
Gordon grabbed his sax

23:13.828 --> 23:16.195
and gave him some backup.

23:16.230 --> 23:17.964
You never told me
you could sing.

23:17.999 --> 23:19.598
Because he can't.

23:19.634 --> 23:20.933
Aw.

23:20.969 --> 23:21.969
For the record,

23:22.003 --> 23:23.869
that question
was directed at me.

23:23.905 --> 23:26.138
And somehow, I'm confident
it was answered correctly.

23:26.174 --> 23:27.139
Thanks, Mom.

23:27.175 --> 23:28.641
Anyway,

23:28.676 --> 23:29.976
as much as I would love

23:30.011 --> 23:31.777
to keep embarrassing Harvey,

23:31.813 --> 23:33.713
I should get back.

23:33.748 --> 23:36.215
Paula, thank you so much

23:36.250 --> 23:38.217
for letting me intrude
on your evening.

23:38.252 --> 23:39.218
It has been a pleasure.

23:39.253 --> 23:41.320
No, Lily,
the pleasure was all mine.

23:41.356 --> 23:42.621
I can't tell you how happy I am

23:42.657 --> 23:44.090
to have finally met you.
- Me too,

23:44.125 --> 23:48.127
especially since I have you
to thank for this evening.

23:48.162 --> 23:50.896
Oh, no, well, tonight
was actually Harvey's idea.

23:50.932 --> 23:52.732
I think what my mom meant was

23:52.767 --> 23:54.367
that you were gracious enough

23:54.402 --> 23:55.968
to let her come to dinner
tonight.

23:56.004 --> 23:56.902
No, I meant

23:56.938 --> 23:59.071
when you and I
mended our fences,

23:59.107 --> 24:00.706
you said the only reason
you did it

24:00.742 --> 24:02.575
was because someone special
in your life

24:02.610 --> 24:04.176
encouraged you to.

24:04.212 --> 24:06.846
Well, it's obvious
that someone was Paula.

24:11.419 --> 24:14.720
I just put my foot
in my mouth somehow, didn't I?

24:14.756 --> 24:15.821
Well, it's not your fault,

24:15.857 --> 24:17.001
but I think it just so happens

24:17.025 --> 24:18.257
I am not the special person

24:18.292 --> 24:19.436
that Harvey was talking about.

24:28.036 --> 24:29.735
Thought you could use a snack.

24:32.106 --> 24:33.372
You know me so well.

24:36.511 --> 24:39.645
Some may say,
better than you know yourself.

24:41.215 --> 24:43.849
Rachel, about tonight...

24:43.885 --> 24:46.285
- Bullshit.
- What?

24:46.320 --> 24:47.364
I thought you liked
Father Walker.

24:47.388 --> 24:50.256
I'm not saying that
his advice was bullshit.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.124
I'm saying, my parents
have a word they use

24:52.160 --> 24:54.627
when they want to talk about
the future in a safe way.

24:54.662 --> 24:57.096
If they say "bullshit,"
then they both know

24:57.131 --> 24:59.198
that anything
they say afterwards

24:59.233 --> 25:01.067
is... hypothetical,

25:01.102 --> 25:02.468
and they won't be
locked into it.

25:02.503 --> 25:04.570
Your parents have
the same problem we do?

25:04.605 --> 25:07.239
You should've seen
how they used to fight about

25:07.275 --> 25:09.141
where to go on vacation,

25:09.177 --> 25:12.978
let alone what to do
with their money.

25:13.014 --> 25:14.613
Do you want to try it now?

25:14.649 --> 25:15.614
No, I don't,

25:15.650 --> 25:16.782
because I just don't want

25:16.818 --> 25:18.951
to get into
another fight with you.

25:18.986 --> 25:20.119
To tell you the truth,

25:20.154 --> 25:24.156
I kind of love it
when we fight.

25:24.192 --> 25:27.126
- Do you?
- Not while it's happening,

25:27.161 --> 25:29.328
but Rachel,

25:29.363 --> 25:30.663
we don't fight about things

25:30.698 --> 25:32.398
like who didn't take
the garbage out

25:32.433 --> 25:34.667
or who forgot
to turn the lights off.

25:34.702 --> 25:35.979
We fight about things like
whether or not

25:36.003 --> 25:38.471
I should take a case
to protect prisoners

25:38.506 --> 25:41.841
at the expense of my
relationship with Harvey,

25:41.876 --> 25:43.275
and the only reason we do that

25:43.311 --> 25:45.010
is because you love me

25:45.046 --> 25:47.413
and you care about me,
and yes,

25:47.448 --> 25:50.015
maybe you do know me
better than I know myself.

25:51.953 --> 25:53.819
Wow, maybe we should
try this now.

25:53.855 --> 25:55.588
No, you were right.

25:55.623 --> 25:57.990
Think we've done enough growing
for one night.

26:09.804 --> 26:12.771
Paula,

26:12.807 --> 26:14.640
about what my mom said--

26:14.675 --> 26:15.708
you were right.

26:15.743 --> 26:16.876
I wasn't talking about you

26:16.911 --> 26:19.311
when I told her that, but...

26:19.347 --> 26:23.082
you... are the special woman
in my life now, and--

26:23.117 --> 26:24.783
I know that, Harvey, but--

26:24.819 --> 26:26.285
But what?

26:28.156 --> 26:30.890
I know you know
that Jacob cheated on me,

26:30.925 --> 26:32.892
but what you don't know is

26:32.927 --> 26:33.692
it happened with a woman

26:33.728 --> 26:36.295
that he worked with.

26:36.330 --> 26:38.230
They worked at clinic together,

26:38.266 --> 26:40.633
and they became close friends.

26:40.668 --> 26:43.402
So that's why Donna
bothers you so much.

26:43.437 --> 26:45.237
I know that I told you that

26:45.273 --> 26:47.006
I could handle you having her
in your life,

26:47.041 --> 26:48.073
but I don't think I can.

26:48.109 --> 26:50.242
- But I told you, I--
- Please, Harvey.

26:52.180 --> 26:54.213
I hate that I feel this way.

26:54.248 --> 26:56.081
I hate that I feel weak,

26:56.117 --> 26:57.583
and insecure,

26:57.618 --> 26:59.218
and that my last relationship

26:59.253 --> 27:00.653
is affecting this one,

27:00.688 --> 27:01.353
but most of all,

27:01.389 --> 27:03.022
I hate that I am about to say

27:03.057 --> 27:05.090
what I told myself I wouldn't.

27:05.126 --> 27:06.692
What is it?

27:08.629 --> 27:10.863
When I took the time
to process what you told me,

27:10.898 --> 27:13.866
I did a role-play in therapy,

27:13.901 --> 27:15.401
and when I did,

27:15.436 --> 27:17.236
I told you that I'm afraid

27:17.271 --> 27:19.705
if you keep working with Donna,

27:19.740 --> 27:21.674
we won't survive.

27:21.709 --> 27:23.943
Are you asking me
to fire her?

27:23.978 --> 27:25.144
I don't know what I'm asking,

27:25.179 --> 27:26.223
but it feels like there are
three people

27:26.247 --> 27:28.414
in this relationship,

27:28.449 --> 27:30.549
and the last time it felt
that way, there were.

27:30.585 --> 27:33.552
- Paula--
- I'm sorry, Harvey.

27:33.588 --> 27:35.287
I just can't do that again.

27:59.231 --> 28:00.864
<i>You calling with another</i>
<i>stock tip?</i>

28:00.899 --> 28:02.177
<i>Because it looks like</i>
<i>that last one's</i>

28:02.201 --> 28:03.333
<i>about to make me a fortune.</i>

28:03.369 --> 28:05.435
I'm calling you to tell you
to get out.

28:05.471 --> 28:06.481
We're about to make a deal,

28:06.505 --> 28:08.472
and it's gonna turn around.

28:08.507 --> 28:10.607
Message received.
Hey, do me a favor.

28:10.642 --> 28:13.310
Tell Donna
the gunslinger's back.

28:13.345 --> 28:14.878
<i>I don't get it.</i>

28:14.913 --> 28:16.524
She'll know what it means,
and not for nothing.

28:16.548 --> 28:17.514
Promoting her
was a brilliant move.

28:17.549 --> 28:18.782
What makes you say that?

28:18.817 --> 28:19.716
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>
<i>She could</i>

28:19.752 --> 28:20.951
<i>talk the stripes off a zebra,</i>

28:20.986 --> 28:23.420
<i>she's loyal,</i>
<i>and she knows the big picture</i>

28:23.455 --> 28:24.187
about keeping people happy.

28:24.223 --> 28:25.455
If I were you,

28:25.491 --> 28:26.890
I'd hold on tight.

28:26.925 --> 28:27.925
Thanks, Stu.

28:27.960 --> 28:30.027
<i>Thanks again for the tip,</i>
<i>Harvey.</i>

28:33.165 --> 28:34.464
You ready to do this?

28:34.500 --> 28:35.966
Yeah.

28:36.001 --> 28:37.401
Let's go.

28:37.436 --> 28:39.369
All right, Baxter, we're here.

28:39.405 --> 28:41.738
So you want to sign this thing
with your pen or mine?

28:41.774 --> 28:42.817
You can keep your shitty pen,

28:42.841 --> 28:45.709
just like you can keep
your shitty deal.

28:45.744 --> 28:47.611
If you think you could
call us here

28:47.646 --> 28:48.857
to renegotiate
a price last-minute--

28:48.881 --> 28:50.747
I didn't call to renegotiate.

28:50.783 --> 28:52.649
I called to see if you'd come
at my command,

28:52.684 --> 28:53.884
and here you are.

28:53.919 --> 28:56.219
- All right, listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

28:56.255 --> 28:57.255
Sale's not happening.

28:57.289 --> 28:58.366
Wait, you're passing
on Teddy's offer?

28:58.390 --> 29:00.323
I'd sooner wipe my ass
with Teddy's offer.

29:00.359 --> 29:01.491
Bullshit.
You turn him down,

29:01.527 --> 29:02.604
you're turning down hundreds
of millions of dollars,

29:02.628 --> 29:04.072
and you're not in the business
of losing money.

29:04.096 --> 29:05.273
I'm also not in the business
of letting assholes

29:05.297 --> 29:07.764
get the better of me,

29:07.800 --> 29:08.810
so I'm gonna hold on
to my company,

29:08.834 --> 29:10.901
I'm gonna ship those jobs
overseas,

29:10.936 --> 29:12.414
and I don't give a shit
if I take a bath doing it.

29:12.438 --> 29:14.438
You're really
that vindictive?

29:14.473 --> 29:16.573
Nice to meet you.
Name's Kurt Baxter.

29:18.043 --> 29:20.010
But I'm not doing this
out of spite.

29:20.045 --> 29:21.923
I'm doing this because
when word hits the street

29:21.947 --> 29:23.246
that I'm willing to lose
200 mil

29:23.282 --> 29:24.448
just to stick it to some guys

29:24.483 --> 29:26.616
who are trying to stick it
to me, the next guy--

29:26.652 --> 29:27.762
We're not trying to
stick it to you.

29:27.786 --> 29:28.718
We're trying to make a deal,

29:28.754 --> 29:30.687
and we put two of Th the t,

29:30.722 --> 29:31.555
so if you don't want to sell--

29:31.590 --> 29:32.889
I'm not taking
door number two,

29:32.925 --> 29:35.025
but if you're serious
about coming to terms,

29:35.060 --> 29:37.494
I just might be open
to renegotiating after all.

29:37.529 --> 29:38.895
Son of a bitch.

29:38.931 --> 29:41.331
That's what you really
called us to say, isn't it?

29:41.366 --> 29:42.666
Teddy Doyle wants my company,

29:42.701 --> 29:43.745
he doesn't just match
the Chinese.

29:43.769 --> 29:47.337
He beats them by 25%,
'cause my rules are,

29:47.372 --> 29:48.972
you come to play,
hard,

29:49.007 --> 29:52.008
and if you don't like it,
get the hell off my court.

30:03.222 --> 30:04.888
- Hello.
<i>- Oh, I'm glad you picked up,</i>

30:04.923 --> 30:05.856
<i>Harvey.</i>

30:05.891 --> 30:08.158
<i>I wanted to apologize.</i>

30:08.193 --> 30:09.893
Mom, you don't have to
do that.

30:09.928 --> 30:10.760
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

30:10.796 --> 30:12.329
We finally made peace,

30:12.364 --> 30:14.529
and I go and do
something like that.

30:14.530 --> 30:15.530
<i>Listen to me.</i>

30:15.652 --> 30:17.556
<i>Paula said it, and I agree,</i>

30:17.557 --> 30:19.356
it's not your fault.
You couldn't have known.

30:19.392 --> 30:20.257
<i>It is my fault.</i>

30:20.293 --> 30:22.026
It's the kind of stupid thing

30:22.061 --> 30:23.394
stupid mothers do.

30:23.429 --> 30:25.196
Mom, don't worry about it.

30:25.231 --> 30:26.463
I'm gonna be fine.

30:26.487 --> 30:28.347
<i>Please tell Paula again</i>

30:28.348 --> 30:30.050
<i>how much I enjoyed</i>
<i>meeting her.</i>

30:30.086 --> 30:31.218
<i>She's a keeper.</i>

30:31.512 --> 30:32.277
I gotta go, Mom.

30:32.312 --> 30:33.745
<i>I love you, Harvey.</i>

30:33.781 --> 30:35.247
I love you, too.

30:35.282 --> 30:36.982
Hey,for a second?

30:37.017 --> 30:38.984
We need to tell Stu,

30:39.019 --> 30:40.552
and we need to tell Teddy.

30:40.587 --> 30:41.386
I talked to Stu

30:41.422 --> 30:43.655
before we went over there.
He's out.

30:43.691 --> 30:44.923
And Teddy?

30:44.958 --> 30:46.124
Take the day.

30:46.160 --> 30:48.160
Think of anything you can.

30:48.195 --> 30:50.962
If not, I'll tell him tomorrow.

30:59.206 --> 31:01.440
Hey, I need to meet you.

31:01.475 --> 31:04.109
I need a favor,
and I need it soon.

31:14.455 --> 31:17.355
Hey, Red.
Nice digs.

31:17.391 --> 31:18.468
Stu, what are you
doing here?

31:18.492 --> 31:20.025
I came to thank you
for what you did.

31:20.060 --> 31:22.127
It actually got me thinking,

31:22.162 --> 31:23.128
my office could use
someone like you.

31:23.163 --> 31:24.796
Mm, couldn't everyone?

31:24.832 --> 31:25.909
But as you know,
use of The Donna

31:25.933 --> 31:28.233
is limited to
this office alone.

31:28.268 --> 31:30.802
I wasn't talking about
The Donna.

31:30.838 --> 31:33.405
I was talking about Donna.

31:37.377 --> 31:38.677
- This is a job offer.
- It is,

31:38.712 --> 31:39.544
and I think the numbers on it

31:39.580 --> 31:41.480
will show you that I'm serious.

31:41.515 --> 31:43.415
Stu, I would be lying
if I said this offer

31:43.450 --> 31:45.317
wasn't flattering, but--
- Then take it.

31:45.873 --> 31:47.239
I don't live under a rock,
Donna.

31:47.275 --> 31:48.452
I heard about Andrew Malik
saying that

31:48.476 --> 31:49.808
you don't deserve a job
like this.

31:49.809 --> 31:51.194
I don't care what
that son of a bitch said.

31:51.195 --> 31:52.462
I deserve everything I have.

31:52.463 --> 31:54.383
Then come over to me
and prove that to the world.

31:54.962 --> 31:57.062
I don't know anything
about the world of finance.

31:57.098 --> 31:58.341
You didn't know anything
about the legal world

31:58.365 --> 32:00.065
when you started, either,

32:00.101 --> 32:02.101
but I'm not hiring you
to make trades.

32:02.136 --> 32:03.569
I'm hiring you to do
what you do

32:03.604 --> 32:05.070
better than anyone
on the planet,

32:05.106 --> 32:06.450
because, like I told Harvey
to tell you,

32:06.474 --> 32:08.207
the gunslinger's back.

32:08.242 --> 32:09.242
He didn't tell me that.

32:09.276 --> 32:10.742
Well, he is,

32:10.778 --> 32:12.878
and he needs someone
watching his flank.

32:14.615 --> 32:16.281
I'll think about it.

32:16.317 --> 32:18.517
That's all I can ask.

32:28.896 --> 32:30.529
You better be ready,
Miss Sazs,

32:30.564 --> 32:31.530
'cause I'm ready to--

32:31.565 --> 32:34.032
Louis.

32:34.068 --> 32:35.868
What are you doing here?

32:35.903 --> 32:37.469
I came to discuss
the recruits

32:37.505 --> 32:39.104
that we talked about earlier.
I'm sorry.

32:39.140 --> 32:40.317
I didn't know that
you had company.

32:40.341 --> 32:42.941
Of course.
Louis, this is my fiancé,

32:42.977 --> 32:45.577
Zander.
Zander, Louis.

32:45.613 --> 32:47.479
Hey.

32:47.515 --> 32:48.680
Zander, is it?
- Yeah.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.260
Like I said, I was excited
about the recruits

32:50.284 --> 32:52.651
that we spoke about earlier.

32:52.686 --> 32:54.498
I didn't want to let any
of them get snapped up, s--

32:54.522 --> 32:55.487
but I can see you're busy.

32:55.523 --> 32:56.488
Of course.
We can talk about it

32:56.524 --> 32:59.057
on the phone... tomorrow.

32:59.093 --> 32:59.925
Tomorrow it is.

32:59.960 --> 33:01.460
Sorry to interrupt.

33:01.495 --> 33:03.595
It's nice meeting you.
- Likewise.

33:10.371 --> 33:11.904
That was weird.

33:11.939 --> 33:13.972
Not at all what I imagined.

33:14.008 --> 33:15.741
I mean, with the jacket...

33:15.776 --> 33:17.643
And the glasses
and that bow tie.

33:17.678 --> 33:20.012
I mean, what'd you see in him?
- I know.

33:20.047 --> 33:21.580
What do you say
we get some Chinese?

33:21.615 --> 33:22.581
Sounds good.

33:22.616 --> 33:24.483
I'm starving.

33:31.192 --> 33:32.536
Donna, whatever it is,
can it wait?

33:32.560 --> 33:33.570
Because I need--
- No, it can't wait, Harvey,

33:33.594 --> 33:36.828
because Stu Buzzini
just offered me a job.

33:36.864 --> 33:38.931
- He what?
- You know what.

33:38.966 --> 33:40.310
You can skip the part
where you pretend

33:40.334 --> 33:41.833
you weren't the one
who asked him

33:41.869 --> 33:43.368
to make that offer
in the first place.

33:43.404 --> 33:44.670
How'd you know?

33:44.705 --> 33:45.849
'Cause he gave me
some bullshit

33:45.873 --> 33:46.705
about what Andrew Malik
did to me,

33:46.740 --> 33:47.673
and there's no way
he'd know that

33:47.708 --> 33:49.208
if you didn't tell him.

33:49.243 --> 33:50.876
Does Stu know you know?

33:50.911 --> 33:52.978
I don't want to answer
questions anymore, Harvey.

33:53.013 --> 33:55.314
I want to know why you did it.

33:55.349 --> 33:57.849
Because Paula said
she doesn't think we'd survive

33:57.885 --> 34:01.153
if you and I
keep working together.

34:01.188 --> 34:03.055
Thought we were over that.

34:03.090 --> 34:04.556
Well, she's not.

34:04.592 --> 34:05.290
Then why didn't you
come to me

34:05.326 --> 34:06.892
and explain the situation?

34:06.927 --> 34:09.161
Or even have the balls
just to fire me?

34:09.196 --> 34:10.661
I could never fire you.

34:10.697 --> 34:12.563
Well, this doesn't feel
any different, Harvey,

34:12.600 --> 34:14.366
'cause I don't want
to go work with Stu.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.411
I want to stay here
in the position

34:15.436 --> 34:17.469
that I fought to get
and that I love

34:17.504 --> 34:19.571
and that I know I deserve.

34:19.607 --> 34:22.641
I know you do, too.

34:22.676 --> 34:25.010
Then why didn't you
stand up for me?

34:25.045 --> 34:27.679
Because you put me
in this position.

34:27.715 --> 34:30.047
It was one mistake, Harvey.

34:30.083 --> 34:32.150
One...

34:32.186 --> 34:33.485
in 13 years.

34:34.888 --> 34:36.755
Now I'm gonna lose my job
because of it?

34:36.790 --> 34:38.389
Donna, what do you want me
to say?

34:38.425 --> 34:39.469
I would've wanted you
to tell her

34:39.493 --> 34:41.260
that after everything
we've been through,

34:41.295 --> 34:42.995
making me leave isn't fair.

34:43.030 --> 34:44.206
I would've wanted you
to come to me,

34:44.231 --> 34:46.264
instead of going to Stu
behind my back,

34:46.300 --> 34:48.867
but most of all, I want you
to be there for me now,

34:48.902 --> 34:50.835
like I've been there for you
every single day.

34:50.871 --> 34:52.771
Do you think
I don't hate this?

34:52.806 --> 34:54.351
I do you think I haven't
wracked my brain,

34:54.375 --> 34:55.619
trying to figure
some other way out of it?

34:55.643 --> 34:57.609
Because I have, Donna,

34:57.645 --> 34:59.111
but I don't see one.

34:59.146 --> 35:00.712
Maybe I do.

35:10.970 --> 35:12.636
Come in.

35:14.774 --> 35:16.718
I hope you don't mind.
Harvey told me that you had

35:16.742 --> 35:19.109
a half-hour break
at this time of night.

35:19.145 --> 35:21.412
- I do, but--
- Please.

35:21.447 --> 35:23.714
Paula, just hear me out.

35:23.749 --> 35:25.215
Okay.

35:25.251 --> 35:28.952
I'm sorry I did what I did.

35:28.988 --> 35:30.421
I made a terrible mistake,

35:30.456 --> 35:33.791
and... I apologized to Harvey,

35:33.826 --> 35:37.127
but I didn't apologize to you.

35:37.163 --> 35:39.396
I'm sorry, Paula.

35:41.701 --> 35:43.467
I'm so sorry.

35:43.502 --> 35:44.680
I appreciate your apology,
Donna,

35:44.704 --> 35:46.804
but if you're asking me
to change my mind--

35:46.839 --> 35:47.839
I'm asking you

35:47.873 --> 35:49.306
not to put me in a position

35:49.341 --> 35:51.809
to leave the job that I love,

35:51.844 --> 35:53.210
a job that feels like

35:53.245 --> 35:55.479
I've worked my whole life
to get.

35:55.514 --> 35:58.148
I'm asking you as a woman

35:58.184 --> 36:00.818
and as a professional,

36:00.853 --> 36:02.953
please don't do that.

36:04.256 --> 36:06.790
I want to say yes to you,
but can you swear to me

36:06.826 --> 36:08.959
that nothing like that
will ever happen again?

36:10.863 --> 36:12.596
That.

36:12.631 --> 36:14.765
That right there is why
I said what I said to Harvey

36:14.800 --> 36:17.334
in the first place.

36:17.369 --> 36:19.169
I'm sorry, Donna.
I wish it weren't so,

36:19.205 --> 36:20.170
but it is.

36:29.590 --> 36:30.590
Can I come in?

36:30.624 --> 36:32.474
Depends.
You only come in person

36:32.475 --> 36:33.952
when it's really good news
or really bad.

36:33.953 --> 36:35.150
So which is it?

36:35.151 --> 36:36.461
Why don't you pour me
a cup of coffee,

36:36.485 --> 36:37.885
and I'll tell you inside?

36:40.489 --> 36:42.456
<i>I can't fix it, Teddy.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

36:42.491 --> 36:43.390
<i>Look, if you want,</i>

36:43.426 --> 36:44.503
I'll call your guy
at the factory

36:44.527 --> 36:47.327
and I'll tell him myself.

36:47.363 --> 36:49.663
No, I'll tell him.

36:49.699 --> 36:53.267
It was my word I gave,
not yours.

36:53.302 --> 36:54.468
This isn't your fault.

36:54.503 --> 36:56.070
You can't blame yourself.

36:57.540 --> 36:59.807
Those guys had bled for me,
Harvey.

36:59.842 --> 37:02.810
All they did wrong
was be loyal to me.

37:02.845 --> 37:04.678
I know how you feel.

37:04.714 --> 37:07.481
No offense, Harvey,
but I don't think you do.

37:07.516 --> 37:09.516
Teddy, I never told you this,
but a few years ago,

37:09.552 --> 37:11.418
there was a case
against the firm.

37:11.454 --> 37:13.187
Donna did something
to protect me,

37:13.222 --> 37:16.657
and... it looked like
it might be illegal,

37:16.692 --> 37:18.659
and Jessica had to
fire her for it.

37:18.694 --> 37:20.928
Well, it turned out,
it wasn't illegal,

37:20.963 --> 37:24.465
and we got the whole thing
straightened out, but...

37:24.500 --> 37:26.200
while she was gone...

37:28.504 --> 37:31.939
So, maybe you do know
how it feels.

37:33.476 --> 37:35.509
But you were able
to make it right.

37:35.544 --> 37:37.978
First chance you got,
you made Donna COO,

37:38.013 --> 37:39.179
a real partner.

37:39.215 --> 37:40.514
I--that means something.

37:40.549 --> 37:42.149
Wait, what did you just say?

37:42.184 --> 37:43.851
I said it means something.

37:43.886 --> 37:46.520
No, you said
I made her a partner.

37:46.555 --> 37:47.755
So?

37:47.790 --> 37:49.289
So, I think we may

37:49.325 --> 37:51.024
have a way to fix this thing.

37:55.765 --> 37:57.531
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Do you think we could

37:57.566 --> 37:59.867
still get that deal
from Teddy's suppliers?

37:59.902 --> 38:02.536
Yeah, but why would
we want to do that?

38:02.571 --> 38:03.837
We'd only be
helping out Baxter.

38:03.873 --> 38:09.076
No, we'd be
helping out Teddy.

38:09.111 --> 38:10.244
What did you do?

38:10.279 --> 38:11.323
I convinced him
to buy his company back

38:11.347 --> 38:13.647
based on your suggestion
in the first place.

38:13.682 --> 38:15.327
I thought you said
he didn't have enough capital.

38:15.351 --> 38:16.495
He didn't,
but when you're willing

38:16.519 --> 38:17.729
to offer equity partnership
to your employees,

38:17.753 --> 38:19.987
it's amazing how much
you can raise.

38:20.684 --> 38:21.750
The pension fund.

38:22.132 --> 38:23.398
The pension fund.

38:23.433 --> 38:24.711
And if we get the deal
with the suppliers,

38:24.735 --> 38:28.303
that makes the company worth
the markup that Baxter wants.

38:28.338 --> 38:30.438
- Exactly.
- I'll get on it.

38:31.225 --> 38:32.225
What?

38:32.260 --> 38:34.860
Nothing.
It's just--it's nice

38:34.896 --> 38:36.140
to be on the right side
of a corporate case

38:36.164 --> 38:37.296
for a change.

38:37.331 --> 38:39.064
Sure is, Mike.

38:39.100 --> 38:39.899
Sure is.

38:46.728 --> 38:48.607
San Diego.

38:48.643 --> 38:49.608
What?

38:49.644 --> 38:50.543
Bullshit.

38:50.578 --> 38:52.244
I want to live in San Diego.

38:54.815 --> 38:56.815
By the beach,
or in the mountains?

38:56.851 --> 38:57.783
See, this is the problem.
I don't know,

38:57.818 --> 38:59.618
and I don't want
to get locked in.

38:59.654 --> 39:01.620
Mike, bullshit can't
get you out of

39:01.656 --> 39:02.922
locking yourself in.

39:02.957 --> 39:04.223
Then I don't want to play.

39:04.258 --> 39:06.025
Yes, you do.

39:07.161 --> 39:08.928
All right.

39:11.032 --> 39:12.631
We live in San Diego.

39:12.667 --> 39:14.166
Mm-hm.

39:14.202 --> 39:16.502
I'll get a job
running a clinic,

39:16.537 --> 39:18.771
like Oliver and Nathan.

39:18.806 --> 39:20.239
We surf every morning,

39:20.274 --> 39:22.575
work two hours a day,

39:22.610 --> 39:24.944
and love each other
all night.

39:24.979 --> 39:27.646
Well, you catch on quickly.

39:27.682 --> 39:29.048
Your turn.

39:30.818 --> 39:33.152
Iceland.

39:33.187 --> 39:34.820
Why would you want
to live in Iceland?

39:34.855 --> 39:35.966
- Did I do that to you?
- Yes, you did.

39:35.990 --> 39:37.167
You asked me about
the beach and the mountains.

39:37.191 --> 39:39.458
No, no, no,
those were all positive things.

39:39.493 --> 39:41.205
And I'm positive I don't want
to live in Iceland.

39:41.229 --> 39:44.663
Okay, what if
I told you that...

39:44.699 --> 39:46.632
I've been there before,

39:46.667 --> 39:48.734
it is one of
the most beautiful places

39:48.769 --> 39:50.002
in the world,

39:50.037 --> 39:51.870
and living there together

39:51.906 --> 39:53.505
for a year would be

39:53.541 --> 39:55.774
the adventure of a lifetime?

39:57.311 --> 39:58.477
God, you're good.

39:58.512 --> 40:00.346
Oh, you have no idea.

40:00.381 --> 40:03.215
Yeah, Rachel, I do.

40:16.497 --> 40:17.863
<i>"Dear Harvey,</i>

40:17.898 --> 40:19.365
<i>"effective immediately,</i>

40:19.400 --> 40:20.666
<i>"I, Donna Paulsen,</i>

40:20.701 --> 40:22.801
<i>hereby resign from the firm."</i>

40:25.273 --> 40:28.040
<i>"Make no mistake,</i>
<i>I wish I could stay,</i>

40:28.075 --> 40:29.475
<i>but I know that I can't."</i>

40:31.445 --> 40:33.323
<i>"Therefore, I thank you</i>
<i>for giving me the chance</i>

40:33.347 --> 40:35.547
<i>"to be your</i>
<i>Chief Operating Officer.</i>

40:35.583 --> 40:38.484
<i>I hope I proved myself</i>

40:40.354 --> 40:42.721
<i>"Unfortunately, I didn't</i>
<i>prove myself worthy</i>

40:42.757 --> 40:44.123
<i>"as your friend.</i>

40:44.158 --> 40:46.425
<i>"I put myself first.</i>

40:46.460 --> 40:48.727
<i>"Therefore, it's time</i>
<i>for me to go,</i>

40:48.763 --> 40:50.329
<i>"though I will miss</i>
<i>working with you,</i>

40:50.364 --> 40:52.064
<i>"and everyone at the firm,</i>

40:52.099 --> 40:53.499

40:57.104 --> 40:59.438
<i>"Good-bye, Harvey.</i>

40:59.473 --> 41:02.508
<i>Please consider this</i>
<i>my formal resignation."</i>

41:27.301 --> 41:28.767
Hey.

41:28.803 --> 41:31.870
I didn't know
you were coming over.

41:31.906 --> 41:34.106
I didn't know I was, either,

41:34.141 --> 41:37.409
but I got in a cab,
and I ended up here.

41:37.445 --> 41:39.044
You let Donna go.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.948
She left her letter
of resignation on my desk.

41:42.983 --> 41:45.050
I am sorry, Harvey.

41:45.086 --> 41:47.419
You didn't make me do it.
I chose to.

41:52.159 --> 41:54.226
And now,
I'm choosing to undo it.

41:57.965 --> 41:59.298
I'm sorry, Paula.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.569
I wanted this to work
more than you know,

42:03.604 --> 42:05.404
but--

42:05.439 --> 42:07.439
but I can't give you
what you need.

42:12.046 --> 42:14.513
I hope you find someone
that deserves you.

42:26.026 --> 42:27.426
Good-bye, Paula.

42:29.897 --> 42:31.597
Good-bye, Harvey.

42:57.358 --> 42:59.224
Harvey, what are you
doing here?

42:59.260 --> 43:01.960
I came here to give you this.

43:04.398 --> 43:06.498
Are you sure?

43:06.534 --> 43:08.734
I am.

43:08.769 --> 43:09.968
Does she know?

43:10.004 --> 43:11.570
She does.

43:11.605 --> 43:13.572
It's over.

43:13.607 --> 43:14.840
Are you okay?

43:14.875 --> 43:17.576
Will you come back?

43:17.611 --> 43:19.077
Yes.

43:19.113 --> 43:20.679
Then I'm okay.

43:23.083 --> 43:25.050
See you tomorrow.

43:25.085 --> 43:27.386
Do you want to come in?

43:27.421 --> 43:30.355
Not tonight. No.

43:30.391 --> 43:31.657
Harvey.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.761
Thank you.
