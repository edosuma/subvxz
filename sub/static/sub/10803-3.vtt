WEBVTT

00:04.087 --> 00:07.423
RIKER: Geordi, have you found it yet?
- Not yet.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.762
I'm starting to get some fumes.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.931
Ammonia.

00:16.099 --> 00:19.768
Chlorine. Potassium chloride.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.156
[COUGHING]

00:39.622 --> 00:42.458
Well, I can feel the heat from here.

00:47.338 --> 00:49.089
There it is.

00:49.257 --> 00:53.927
RlKER: How far?
- About ten meters up the ODN line.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.679
Boy, it's hot.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.724
I'd say over 2,000 degrees.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.477
I'm going in.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.246
[ALARM BEEPING]

01:27.587 --> 01:31.340
We're okay. l've activated
the emergency suppression system.

01:31.883 --> 01:34.384
All his vital functions
are completely normal.

01:34.552 --> 01:37.805
The interface unit is operating
within expected parameters.

01:37.972 --> 01:40.182
Why did he start coughing
when he went through the gases?

01:40.350 --> 01:41.642
Psychosomatic response.

01:42.143 --> 01:44.353
I feel like I'm actually here.

01:44.521 --> 01:48.190
I mean, there, in the Jefferies tube.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.026
It's funny, when I saw the smoke
I couldn't help but cough.

01:51.486 --> 01:54.571
No one has ever reported
so complete a sensory experience.

01:54.739 --> 01:56.573
The interface is perfect for Geordi

01:56.741 --> 01:58.450
because his VISOR inputs
allow the probe

01:58.618 --> 02:01.912
to transmit information
directly into his cerebral cortex.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.498
It looks like this is going to work.

02:05.333 --> 02:08.669
Geordi, I'd like to get the probe
out of the Jefferies tube,

02:08.837 --> 02:11.839
onto the launch bay
before we reach Marijne VlI.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.757
Will do.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.260
Wait a minute.

02:16.469 --> 02:19.847
Something's wrong.
I can't get my left leg to work.

02:22.058 --> 02:23.559
What is it?

02:23.893 --> 02:25.310
The probe is designed to respond

02:25.478 --> 02:27.729
to any movement
Geordi intends to make.

02:27.939 --> 02:30.065
When his brain sends a message
to move his leg,

02:30.233 --> 02:32.609
the interface should move
the probe instead.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.070
Apparently,
the tactile sensors are too low.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.489
I will increase the input.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.493
There it goes.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.789
I'm on my way down.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.833
Why the body suit?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.626
It provides tactile sensations

02:49.794 --> 02:52.838
so that Geordi can feel he's in
the same environment as the probe.

03:01.222 --> 03:02.347
Geordi, what's wrong?

03:04.100 --> 03:05.392
Nothing.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.020
I'm seeing my reflection in a panel.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.607
Forgot what a handsome guy I am.

03:42.222 --> 03:46.391
PICARD:
Space, the final frontier.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.979
These are the voyages
ofthe starship Enterprise.

03:51.147 --> 03:56.318
Its continuing mission:
to explore strange new worlds,

03:56.653 --> 04:00.822
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

04:01.157 --> 04:05.494
to boldly go where no one
has gone before.

05:04.470 --> 05:08.223
PICARD:
Captain's log, stardate 4721 5.5.

05:08.391 --> 05:12.311
We are responding to a distress call
from the science vessel Raman,

05:12.478 --> 05:15.272
which is apparently trapped inside
the turbulent atmosphere

05:15.440 --> 05:18.025
of an unusual gas giant planet.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.235
We will use
an experimental interface probe

05:20.403 --> 05:22.654
in our attempt to rescue it.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.407
I have reviewed
the vessel's mission plans.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.784
The Raman was to descend
to the lower atmosphere,

05:27.952 --> 05:30.746
1 1 ,000 kilometers
below its current position.

05:30.913 --> 05:33.206
The crew was to sample
the atmosphere at that level,

05:33.374 --> 05:35.000
and then return to a safer orbit.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.835
Something must have happened
down there.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.045
Maybe the shields failed,

05:38.212 --> 05:41.548
or they had some kind
of an inversion reaction in the nacelles.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.758
Any life signs?

05:42.925 --> 05:44.593
LA FORGE:
Our biosensors are useless.

05:44.802 --> 05:46.345
Too much interference
in the atmosphere.

05:46.512 --> 05:47.763
Their crew might still be alive.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.931
There's no way we can tell
from up here.

05:50.099 --> 05:52.809
Will the probe be able to transmit
through that interference?

05:52.977 --> 05:55.812
The probe sends information
via a focused particle beam.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.939
It should be able to cut through
the interference.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.692
But we may have to operate the probe
at close-to-tolerance levels.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.862
Hm. Will your nervous system
be able to handle

06:04.030 --> 06:05.489
that much sensory input?

06:05.698 --> 06:08.367
We've already tested the interface
at about 70 percent tolerance.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.285
We shouldn't have any trouble
going higher.

06:10.453 --> 06:13.705
The safety override will kick in
at about 98 percent tolerance,

06:13.873 --> 06:15.415
and that will disengage the interface.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.627
Captain, l am receiving a transmission
from Starfleet Command.

06:18.795 --> 06:19.836
Admiral Holt.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.047
In my Ready Room.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.175
The seven people on that ship
are our first priority.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.719
- Is the probe ready for launch?
- Yes, sir.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.805
Send it directly
to the aft section of the Raman

06:29.972 --> 06:31.181
through the secondary airlock.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.767
That should put it just
one bulkhead away from the Bridge.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.978
I'll interface with the probe
as soon as it's ready.

06:37.146 --> 06:39.940
- Take it the rest of the way from there.
- Make it so.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.703
Hello, Marcus.

06:53.913 --> 06:57.833
- Jean-Luc.
- How's life on DS Three?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.585
We're hosting this year's palio.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.629
The, uh, Ferengi
have already been accused

07:02.797 --> 07:06.425
of trying to bribe the Breen pilot
into throwing the race.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.177
Well, there's nothing unusual
about that.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.512
Nothing at all.

07:12.473 --> 07:16.309
I wish l could say that l was calling
just to catch up on things.

07:17.895 --> 07:22.858
Nine days ago, the Hera left here
on a routine courier mission.

07:23.025 --> 07:26.611
We were in contact with it
for five of those days.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.448
Then the ship disappeared
without a trace.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.784
- The Hera?
- I'm afraid so.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.287
The Excelsior and the Nobel
have been retracing its course

07:35.455 --> 07:37.873
for the last 72 hours.

07:38.207 --> 07:42.210
Nothing. l'm going to keep them at it
for another 72.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.379
But to be honest,

07:44.547 --> 07:47.591
I don't think another week
would make any difference.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.343
I'll inform Commander La Forge.

07:59.395 --> 08:01.521
Mr. Data, I'd like a word
with Commander La Forge.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.774
Aye, sir. I will be on the Bridge.

08:10.573 --> 08:14.242
Geordi,
I've just spoken with Starfleet.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.870
The Hera is missing.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.581
Missing?

08:21.876 --> 08:23.543
My mother?

08:23.711 --> 08:27.923
Captain La Forge has disappeared,
along with the rest of her crew.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.895
SILVA:
I saw your father last week,

08:42.063 --> 08:44.564
and your sister
about ten days before that.

08:45.191 --> 08:49.027
- I decided l missed my favorite son.
- Your only son, Mom.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.696
You're going to have to see
the Hera again.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.865
We have a lot of new faces
onboard.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.617
Including a chief engineer

08:55.785 --> 08:59.454
who juices up the nacelles
every chance she gets.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.374
I think she's the best technician
in the fleet.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.085
Okay, second best.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.045
[DOOR CHIMES]

09:08.548 --> 09:10.090
Come in.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.806
- I'm sorry, l didn't know you were--
- Don't worry about it.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.897
Maybe you should meet her.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.191
We're going to be
in the same sector next week.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.569
Take a shuttle over
and l'll introduce you.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.321
My mother's
always trying to find me a wife.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.490
SILVA:
--at your father's birthday party.

09:35.658 --> 09:39.035
Remember, if you talk to him,
it's a surprise.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.627
This came in about three weeks ago.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.132
I never got back to her.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.307
Geordi, the probe has entered
the planet's atmosphere,

10:00.474 --> 10:02.017
and I'm ready to take it onto the ship.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.352
If you would like to take
a couple of days off,

10:04.520 --> 10:05.645
I'll run the interface.

10:05.813 --> 10:09.149
The interface is calibrated specifically
to my VISOR's inputs.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.526
It would take you at least ten hours
to convert it,

10:11.694 --> 10:13.236
and those crewmen down there
can't wait.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.405
The interface doesn't have to be
fully compatible.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.698
I could run it right now.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.700
I wouldn't have
the same control that you have,

10:18.868 --> 10:20.368
but it would still work.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.162
Forget it.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.164
I'm the best person for the job.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.458
There's no reason why
we shouldn't proceed as planned.

10:26.626 --> 10:30.295
- The Hera is reason enough.
- The Hera is missing, that's all.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.881
Until I hear something different,
my mother just might as well

10:33.049 --> 10:34.841
have taken the crew
on an unscheduled holiday.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.635
Let's go.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.312
Captain,
the probe is through the airlock

10:47.480 --> 10:49.606
and in position aboard the Raman.

10:49.774 --> 10:52.859
Picard to Commander Data. Report.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.278
We are ready
to bring the interface online, sir.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.988
PICARD:
Proceed.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.159
Activating the remote sensors.

11:01.702 --> 11:04.496
Initiating interface, now.

11:05.247 --> 11:07.916
Vital signs are normal.
Geordi, how do you feel?

11:08.125 --> 11:09.167
Fine.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.879
DATA: Do you have visual contact?
- Not yet.

11:13.631 --> 11:17.926
Data, turn up the input sensors.
I'm not seeing anything.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.803

11:19.970 --> 11:22.639
Okay, I can see. But no colors.

11:22.807 --> 11:26.309
Increasing signal strength
to 75 percent of tolerance.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.481
LA FORGE:
Ah.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.651
- That's better.
CRUSHER: Your pulse has gone up.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.904
Your nervous system probably
has to get used to the input levels.

11:38.072 --> 11:43.201
I'm excited, that's all, doctor.
This is like being on a roller coaster.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.577
[CHUCKLES]

11:44.745 --> 11:47.956
Or a first date. I'm all right.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.542
I'll be the judge of that.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.461
If your heart rate gets too high,
we're gonna disconnect you.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.047
Understood.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.800
It's a mess in here.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.761
There must be a breach in the hull
someplace.

12:03.848 --> 12:08.143
I'm picking up atmospheric gases
in the corridor.

12:08.394 --> 12:12.272
Methane and ammonia, primarily.

12:14.817 --> 12:19.195
That break in the hull
might even be on the Bridge itself.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.825
I'm heading towards the Bridge.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.288
I've found someone.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.206
DATA:
What is your position?

12:30.374 --> 12:34.836
About 12 meters
up the main corridor.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.881
He's trapped under some conduit
from the bulkhead.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.507
I can't move it.

12:39.675 --> 12:42.177
I'm gonna need more power
to the tractor beam.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.930
CRUSHER: Go to 80 percent
of tolerance, Data. No higher.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.516
[GRUNTS]

12:56.859 --> 12:58.610
He's dead.

13:00.362 --> 13:01.863
Data,

13:02.406 --> 13:05.950
that door at the end of this corridor.

13:06.118 --> 13:10.413
- What's it lead to?
DATA: A magnetic storage bay.

13:10.748 --> 13:16.377
If there was a break in the Bridge,
that'd be the safest place to go.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.719
[GRUNTING]

13:24.887 --> 13:27.639
Data, give me a phaser burst.

13:27.973 --> 13:32.143
Narrow focus, level-four intensity.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.027
I've found them.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.879
They're dead.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.173
All of them.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.261
There's a fire in here.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.764
- Aah!
- Data, disconnect.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.561
What happened? Geordi.

14:14.728 --> 14:18.773
I don't know. My hands...

14:22.278 --> 14:24.320
CRUSHER:
They're burned.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.454
PICARD:
How did this happen?

14:33.622 --> 14:36.708
CRUSHER: There was some kind of
energy discharge in the interface suit.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.252
But shouldn't the safety overrides
have prevented that?

14:39.420 --> 14:41.796
Yes, but I have a theory
why they didn't.

14:41.964 --> 14:45.258
The tolerance levels of the interface
were set extremely high.

14:45.426 --> 14:48.136
I think Geordi's neural response
to the input was so strong

14:48.304 --> 14:50.305
that it created a feedback loop.

14:50.472 --> 14:53.182
The sensors that were transmitting
the sensation of heat to my hands

14:53.392 --> 14:55.310
must have overloaded.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.520
The crew of the Raman are dead.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.315
I would like to retrieve them
and their vessel,

15:00.482 --> 15:02.901
but not if it means
putting Geordi's safety at risk.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.778
If we turn down the sensory input
on the probe, I should be fine.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.657
Seven people lost their lives
down there, captain.

15:09.825 --> 15:13.036
We should at least retrieve
the information they were collecting.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.621
Doctor?

15:14.788 --> 15:16.998
If we operate the interface
at lower input levels,

15:17.166 --> 15:20.001
I'd say the risk is acceptable.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.670
- Picard to Riker.
RlKER: Riker here.

15:22.838 --> 15:24.589
We will proceed with the probe.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.300
We'll have to take it into
the Raman's auxiliary control room.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.344
Their Bridge is too badly damaged.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.429
How long
before you have it in position?

15:31.597 --> 15:34.057
A couple of hours.
We have to cut through the bulkhead.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.767
Acknowledged.

15:39.396 --> 15:41.773
Well, it looks like
you'll have time to recuperate.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.983
Yeah.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.403
There's something
I've got to do anyway.

15:52.409 --> 15:53.660
How are you, Dad?

15:53.827 --> 15:57.288
As well as could be expected,
under the circumstances.

15:57.915 --> 16:01.292
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.878
I spoke with your sister this morning.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.423
She said she'll be in touch with you
in a few days.

16:07.591 --> 16:10.385
Right now, she's pretty upset.

16:12.888 --> 16:18.059
The service for the Hera
will probably be on Vulcan.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.269
Most of the crew were from there.

16:20.896 --> 16:24.357
But your sister and I
want to have a private ceremony.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.150
Dad...

16:28.529 --> 16:32.198
Don't you think
everybody's jumping the gun here?

16:32.741 --> 16:35.994
Last I heard, there were still two
starships out there looking for them.

16:36.161 --> 16:39.163
They found no debris,
no residual warp distortion.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.915
And no ship.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.875
Not yet,
but that doesn't mean they won't.

16:43.043 --> 16:47.046
Starfleet is considering
the Hera lost.

16:47.423 --> 16:51.300
The search isn't much more
than a formality at this point.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.679
Geordi,

16:55.264 --> 16:57.140
your mother's gone.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.560
Yeah, well, you can think that
if you want.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.855
But until I see some hard evidence,
I'm not gonna give up hope.

17:08.485 --> 17:10.278
All right, Geordi.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.072
Call me if you need anything.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.548
[DOOR CHIMES]

17:30.716 --> 17:31.883
Come in.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.512
Hey, Data.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.350
- Still working?
- No.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.644
I have completed the adjustments
to the interface.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.188
I am now waiting
for Commander Riker

17:45.355 --> 17:47.648
to finish moving the probe.

17:50.152 --> 17:53.738
- Do you need to be comforted?
- No.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.574
I was just passing by.
I was wondering what you were up to.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.828
I am using the time
to catch up on my study of poetry.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.920
LA FORGE:
Data, there's nothing on the screen.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.756
That is not entirely correct.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.550
While it is true
the display is currently blank,

18:14.718 --> 18:17.929
this emptiness
has a poetic meaning.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.973
Therefore it cannot be considered
nothing as such.

18:21.141 --> 18:24.435
- Says who?
- The ancient Doosodarians.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.897
Much of their poetry contained
such lacunae or empty spaces.

18:28.065 --> 18:30.858
Often these pauses
measured several days in length,

18:31.026 --> 18:33.528
during which poet and audience
were encouraged

18:33.695 --> 18:36.989
to fully acknowledge
the emptiness of the experience.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.075
I remember a few lectures
from Starfleet Academy

18:39.243 --> 18:40.284
that seemed that way.

18:43.539 --> 18:46.040
Are you certain you do not wish
to talk about your mother?

18:47.793 --> 18:48.960
Why would you say that?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.003
You are no doubt
feeling emotional distress

18:51.171 --> 18:53.381
as a result of her disappearance.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.008
While you claim to be
just passing by,

18:56.176 --> 18:58.427
that is most likely an excuse
to start a conversation

18:58.595 --> 19:00.555
about this uncomfortable subject.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.015
- Am l correct?
- No, Data.

19:03.183 --> 19:07.770
Sometimes just passing by
means just passing by.

19:07.938 --> 19:12.441
Hm. Then l apologize
for my premature assumption.

19:13.068 --> 19:16.863
This particular poem
has a lacunae of 47 minutes.

19:17.030 --> 19:20.283
You may experience
the emptiness with me if you wish.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.452
Thanks.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.463
You know, Data,

19:35.007 --> 19:39.260
maybe you gave up a little too easily.

19:39.636 --> 19:40.928
I do not understand.

19:41.096 --> 19:47.059
Well, when I said
just passing by means just passing by,

19:47.227 --> 19:49.103
I really didn't mean it.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.772
Then my initial assumption
was correct.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.442
You do wish to speak
of your mother.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.653
Am I crazy to think
that she's still alive?

19:57.821 --> 19:59.947
Your sanity is not in question.

20:00.115 --> 20:04.827
However, your evaluation
of the available information is biased.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.330
She's a starship captain.

20:07.497 --> 20:10.541
She's gotten herself into and out of
impossible situations before.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.710
Why should this be any different?

20:14.338 --> 20:16.631
Disappearances
fitting the profile of the Hera

20:16.798 --> 20:19.634
have rarely ended with
the safe recovery of ship and crew.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.845
Well, that makes me feel
much better.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.014
[SIGHS

20:27.434 --> 20:32.063
Look, I'm sorry, Data.
I didn't mean to snap at you.

20:32.773 --> 20:33.814
I am not offended.

20:34.024 --> 20:37.401
You are upset.
Your reactions are not surprising.

20:37.569 --> 20:42.490
It's just that if she really is dead,

20:44.451 --> 20:46.827
I don't know what l'm gonna do.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.417
We're receiving
the probe's telemetry.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.545
The input levels are currently
at 53 percent of tolerance.

20:56.713 --> 20:57.838
That's too low, Data,

20:58.006 --> 20:59.757
I won't be able
to do anything down there.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.468
I wanna start with as wide a margin
of safety as possible.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.345
We can adjust upward later.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.847
- Ready?
- Go ahead.

21:07.307 --> 21:09.392
Initiating interface.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.646
I can't see anything.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.524
DATA:
I am increasing the input now.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.150
LA FORGE:
Yeah.

21:18.318 --> 21:22.196
Yeah, that's better, but I need more.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.409
DATA:
ls this level sufficient?

21:32.708 --> 21:34.208
Geordi?

21:37.587 --> 21:39.463
Geordi, do you hear me?

21:45.762 --> 21:47.763
Mom?

21:49.766 --> 21:53.728
- Mom, is it you?
- Is it you?

21:55.397 --> 21:57.231
Oh, I forgot,
all you can see is this probe.

21:57.399 --> 22:00.401
Yes, it's me.
I'm actually on the Enterprise.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.528
I'm interfaced with this probe.

22:02.696 --> 22:03.779
Geordi.

22:04.239 --> 22:07.408
Who are you speaking to?
What are you seeing?

22:07.576 --> 22:09.702
But is it really you?

22:09.870 --> 22:13.289
Yes, Geordi. lt's Mom.

22:14.082 --> 22:16.083
But how can that be?
I mean, how is this possible?

22:16.251 --> 22:19.920
There's no time to explain.
We have to go down.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.757
- Down where?
- The surface.

22:22.924 --> 22:26.010
- Geordi, report.
- Hang on, doctor.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.472
Why? Why do we have to go down
to the surface?

22:29.639 --> 22:32.767
- We're dying.
- We?

22:33.977 --> 22:36.062
The Hera?
You mean the Hera is down there?

22:36.229 --> 22:37.897
CRUSHER:
We're disconnecting you right now.

22:38.065 --> 22:41.275
- No, wait.
- We need your help. I need your help.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.985
- Geordi--
- Mom-- Ah!

22:43.945 --> 22:46.864
The cutoff has been
automatically activated.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.493
He's in neural shock.

22:53.955 --> 22:56.957
The sensory overload didn't cause
any permanent damage,

22:57.125 --> 23:00.211
but I wouldn't want to expose his brain
to that kind of stimulus again.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.838
Is there any indication
what caused this hallucination?

23:03.006 --> 23:07.676
- His brain functions are normal.
- I told you, l wasn't hallucinating.

23:07.886 --> 23:11.055
Geordi, I have analyzed
the probe sensor logs.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.556
There are no records to indicate

23:12.724 --> 23:14.809
the presence of a living human
onboard the Raman.

23:14.976 --> 23:17.978
Well, she wasn't exactly there.
Her ship is down on the surface.

23:18.146 --> 23:21.607
So you believe that what you saw
was some kind of transmission?

23:21.983 --> 23:25.027
Somehow she has managed
to communicate with me.

23:25.195 --> 23:27.822
We have no indication
of a transmission of any kind.

23:28.365 --> 23:29.990
Maybe I'm the only one
who can detect it

23:30.158 --> 23:32.701
because I'm interfaced
with the probe.

23:34.329 --> 23:37.164
The probe does allow Geordi
to sense quantum fluctuations,

23:37.332 --> 23:39.166
subspace anomalies,
and other phenomenon

23:39.334 --> 23:41.627
not perceptible
by any other kind of sensor.

23:41.795 --> 23:44.713
Granted, but how could he perceive
his mother visually

23:44.881 --> 23:46.841
as if she were standing there
in the room?

23:47.008 --> 23:49.635
I'm not sure, but I do know
that our brains weren't designed

23:49.803 --> 23:53.097
to process the kind of sensory
information Geordi was getting.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.516
When the brain receives something
it doesn't understand,

23:55.725 --> 23:58.811
it interprets the input as best it can.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.981
Sometimes as a smell or a sound,
sometimes visually.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.358
- You see?
CRUSHER: But, Geordi,

24:05.235 --> 24:09.196
I'm not saying that your mother
was really communicating with you.

24:09.364 --> 24:12.366
I'm just trying to give you a reason why
you might have thought that she was.

24:12.576 --> 24:13.659
Look, I'm telling you,

24:13.827 --> 24:15.327
my mother's ship
is trapped down there.

24:15.495 --> 24:17.163
And we've got to help them.

24:17.330 --> 24:21.542
Geordi, the Hera's last reported
position was 300 light-years away.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.252
How could it end up here?

24:23.420 --> 24:25.087
If the Hera is on the surface,

24:25.255 --> 24:28.299
its hull could not possibly withstand
the pressure of the atmosphere.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.718
Well, at least let me go back
down there just to be sure.

24:30.886 --> 24:33.179
I do not recommend
that he use the interface again.

24:33.346 --> 24:35.181
The sensory overload
almost killed you.

24:35.348 --> 24:36.390
I'll be all right.

24:36.558 --> 24:39.059
No, no, l'm sorry Geordi,
I'm not prepared to risk your life.

24:39.227 --> 24:41.437
Data, find another way
of salvaging the Raman.

24:41.605 --> 24:44.565
I want an alternate plan in two hours.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.734
Geordi.

24:47.986 --> 24:52.198
I'd like you to talk to Counselor Troi.
She's expecting you.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.871
What's your mother like, Geordi?

25:00.415 --> 25:03.042
If you think I'm gonna start
talking about my childhood, counselor,

25:03.210 --> 25:04.877
you're way off.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.587
That's not what I asked.

25:12.093 --> 25:15.429
Well, she's...

25:18.517 --> 25:20.351
She's brilliant.

25:21.603 --> 25:22.686
Funny.

25:23.104 --> 25:25.981
She's incredibly perceptive.

25:26.149 --> 25:28.192
She knows people.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.612
Knows what they're all about
even before they open their mouths.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.657
She's always been that way,

25:35.867 --> 25:38.369
she's a real good judge of character.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.287
When was the last time
you saw her?

25:41.373 --> 25:43.290
About seven months ago,

25:43.458 --> 25:45.543
when she first took command
of the Hera.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.212
I went to a party
she had for her crew.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.631
She wanted me to come over
and see her

25:50.799 --> 25:54.134
but I was really busy at the time.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.348
I mean, I suppose
I could have made the time

25:59.558 --> 26:04.270
to go and see her but,
you know, I just didn't think that...

26:06.648 --> 26:12.152
I mean, you know,
I didn't think that...

26:12.320 --> 26:14.989
You didn't think
it would be your last chance to see her.

26:15.198 --> 26:17.491
That's not what I was gonna say.

26:20.912 --> 26:23.455
I want to suggest something.

26:23.623 --> 26:26.667
Call it a theory, all right?

26:27.711 --> 26:29.336
All right.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.631
You're worried about
the disappearance of your mother.

26:32.799 --> 26:36.427
Guilty that you didn't see her
when you had the chance.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.888
So you're unwilling to consider
that she might be dead.

26:41.057 --> 26:43.851
Your need to believe she's alive
is so strong

26:44.019 --> 26:48.480
that it manifests itself
as a physical image.

26:48.648 --> 26:51.025
Yeah, but she told me
she's trapped on that planet,

26:51.192 --> 26:52.526
that she's in danger.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.528
Now, if this were some sort
of wish fulfillment,

26:54.696 --> 26:57.573
don't you think I'd be fantasizing her
safe and sound?

26:57.741 --> 26:59.199
No.

26:59.576 --> 27:01.869
Because that would be the end
of your fantasy.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.829
You'd know it wasn't true.

27:06.833 --> 27:11.837
The more involved and complicated

27:12.005 --> 27:15.716
and unending your story is,

27:16.593 --> 27:19.845
the longer you can believe
your mother's still alive.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.891
Yeah, well, that's your theory,
counselor.

27:24.267 --> 27:26.226
I've got one of my own.

27:31.566 --> 27:34.151
I have been exploring the possibility
of using a tractor beam

27:34.319 --> 27:36.070
to pull the Raman
from the atmosphere.

27:36.237 --> 27:39.114
However, the high level of interference
prevents a positive lock.

27:39.282 --> 27:41.075
If we set up
some sort of relay system?

27:41.242 --> 27:43.077
That is my conclusion as well,
commander.

27:43.244 --> 27:46.080
Two shuttlecrafts staggered between
the Enterprise and the Raman,

27:46.247 --> 27:49.041
with their shields adjusted
to re-focus the tractor beam.

27:49.793 --> 27:52.002
Can we get the shuttles close enough
without danger?

27:52.170 --> 27:55.339
- Mr. La Forge?
- Sure. Um...

27:55.632 --> 27:57.925
Yeah, as long as we keep them both
above the troposphere,

27:58.093 --> 27:59.134
that will be all right.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.846
- Then in that case--
LA FORGE: But what about the Hera?

28:03.014 --> 28:05.557
We'd be leaving my mother
and her crew stranded on the planet.

28:05.725 --> 28:07.518
- Commander--
- I've been thinking about this.

28:08.978 --> 28:11.689
A couple of weeks ago,
I got a message from my mother.

28:11.856 --> 28:13.273
She said she had
a new chief engineer

28:13.441 --> 28:15.818
who had been experimenting
with the warp drive.

28:15.985 --> 28:17.403
Now, l've seen the Hera.

28:17.570 --> 28:21.115
It uses trionic initiators
in the warp coil.

28:21.282 --> 28:23.158
They have a reputation
for strange side effects,

28:23.326 --> 28:25.035
especially when you
play around with them.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.329
There have been reports
of warp bubbles

28:27.497 --> 28:29.415
and other subspace deformations.

28:29.582 --> 28:32.918
So, what if that's what happened?

28:33.086 --> 28:39.133
Not a warp bubble,
but a subspace funnel.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.009
Connecting two points
through subspace.

28:41.177 --> 28:43.637
Well, the Hera could have
accidentally created a distortion

28:43.805 --> 28:45.639
that emptied out right here
on Marijne VII.

28:45.807 --> 28:46.932
Why here?

28:47.100 --> 28:49.935
Well, the Hera passed by this planet
just ten days ago.

28:50.103 --> 28:53.105
Now, there's an awful lot of subspace
disturbance in the atmosphere.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.733
The ship could have accidentally
picked up some residual traces

28:55.900 --> 28:57.526
that directed the funnel
right back here.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.778
So the Hera's in one piece,
somewhere out there?

28:59.946 --> 29:03.115
Well, maybe it's being surrounded
by some kind of warp field,

29:03.283 --> 29:04.992
but who knows for how long?

29:05.160 --> 29:06.827
Mr. La Forge,
do you have any evidence

29:06.995 --> 29:08.662
to support this hypothesis?

29:08.830 --> 29:10.539
I did pick up some
strange subspace readings

29:10.707 --> 29:12.124
when I was interfaced
with the probe.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.500
That could have been anything.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.335
LA FORGE:
But l talked to her, commander.

29:15.503 --> 29:18.297
She asked me to bring the Raman
closer to the planet.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.633
Mr. Data, is any of this possible?

29:23.678 --> 29:27.055
Yes, sir.
However, it is highly unlikely.

29:27.265 --> 29:28.348
How unlikely?

29:29.350 --> 29:30.601
Nearly impossible, sir.

29:32.687 --> 29:34.146
Let's proceed with the shuttle plan.

29:34.314 --> 29:36.356
- Captain--
- Dismissed.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.611
Mr. La Forge.

29:44.991 --> 29:47.701
I want you to know
that I am not unsympathetic

29:47.869 --> 29:49.369
to what you're going through.

29:49.537 --> 29:51.789
Your mother's disappearance
is tragic,

29:51.956 --> 29:56.627
but I cannot risk your safety
on the basis of a dubious hypothesis.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.962
Captain, if I'm right,

29:59.130 --> 30:01.548
and there's just one chance in a million
that she's alive--

30:01.716 --> 30:05.219
I'm sorry, Geordi.
My decision is made.

30:06.554 --> 30:08.388
I understand, sir.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.609
We'll be in position
to use the tractor beam

30:20.819 --> 30:22.402
in less than an hour.

30:22.946 --> 30:25.823
You didn't come all the way down here
to tell me that.

30:26.658 --> 30:27.950
No, I didn't.

30:29.494 --> 30:30.953
Geordi.

30:32.747 --> 30:36.166
I may have seemed a little harsh
about the situation aboard the Raman.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.794
I just don't like the idea
of one of my best officers

30:38.962 --> 30:40.838
putting himself
in unnecessary danger.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.257
I guess l feel like
I should be the one to decide

30:43.424 --> 30:45.384
whether it's unnecessary or not.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.928
My mother died when I was a baby.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.305
All l had was pictures,

30:50.765 --> 30:53.600
and the stories that my father
used to tell me about her.

30:54.269 --> 30:57.771
I begged him to tell those stories
over and over.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.738
When I was 5
and I went to school,

31:06.948 --> 31:10.617
I started to tell my new friends
those same stories.

31:10.785 --> 31:13.161
Pretending that she was alive.

31:14.205 --> 31:15.956
Then I started believing
that she was alive,

31:16.124 --> 31:18.458
that she'd just gone away.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.752
But that she was coming back.

31:22.171 --> 31:24.464
The teacher got wind of this.

31:25.550 --> 31:28.093
She and my father
had this talk with me.

31:29.095 --> 31:32.598
They told me
it was important to accept the fact

31:32.765 --> 31:34.892
that my mother was dead.

31:35.602 --> 31:38.437
And that she wasn't coming back,

31:38.605 --> 31:43.984
and all the hoping in the world
wouldn't make it so.

31:46.195 --> 31:51.033
In my mind, that was the day
that my mother actually died.

31:52.702 --> 31:55.162
I cried all that night,

31:55.872 --> 31:58.582
but after that, it started feeling better.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.667
Your mother was dead.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.337
There was proof.
There was a body and a funeral.

32:03.504 --> 32:05.172
- It was a reality.
- Geordi--

32:05.340 --> 32:08.008
If I could see a body,
if there were wreckage,

32:08.176 --> 32:12.638
I could accept it,
but my mother has just disappeared.

32:12.805 --> 32:17.851
And now,
there's a possibility that she is alive.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.938
And I'm not gonna quit.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.024
Not yet.

32:45.129 --> 32:48.382
I suspected you would attempt
to operate the interface alone.

32:48.549 --> 32:49.883
Did you?

32:50.051 --> 32:51.969
I am familiar enough
with your behavior patterns

32:52.136 --> 32:55.472
to predict certain decisions.

32:56.057 --> 32:58.016
Well, I guess
you know me pretty well.

32:59.519 --> 33:00.936
You are disobeying the captain.

33:01.145 --> 33:02.562
I can't just sit back and do nothing

33:02.730 --> 33:04.856
when I know that my mother
may be down on that planet.

33:06.192 --> 33:09.111
I cannot allow you
to endanger your well-being.

33:10.989 --> 33:15.575
Data, if I leave
without knowing for sure,

33:15.743 --> 33:18.453
then I'll have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

33:18.621 --> 33:21.623
Wondering if I left her to die.

33:21.791 --> 33:24.001
I couldn't do that.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.670
That's why l've got to do this.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.589
I could have you confined to quarters
for the duration of the mission.

33:29.757 --> 33:32.634
If that's what you need to do, Data,
do it because nothing short of that

33:32.802 --> 33:35.095
is gonna stop me
from trying to save my mother.

33:42.895 --> 33:44.229
What are you doing?

33:44.397 --> 33:48.150
I will monitor the interface
and attempt to keep you safe.

33:50.361 --> 33:53.864
I cannot have you confined to quarters
for something you have not yet done.

33:54.657 --> 33:56.867
You know we could both get
in a lot of trouble for this.

33:59.120 --> 34:02.914
There is a high degree of probability
that you are correct.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.834
Thanks, Data.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.963
However, I do have a request.

34:10.131 --> 34:13.091
Yeah? What's that?

34:13.259 --> 34:15.510
I would ask you
to consider the possibility

34:15.678 --> 34:19.056
that what you see is not real.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.767
I will.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.269
I promise.

34:28.274 --> 34:30.400
I am establishing the interface.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.203
LA FORGE:
Mom?

34:44.499 --> 34:46.249
Mom?

34:46.417 --> 34:50.420
SILVA: Hello, Geordi.
- Mom.

34:50.588 --> 34:52.756
How did you get here?

34:53.174 --> 34:54.591
I'm not really with you, Geordi.

34:54.759 --> 34:58.845
I'm on my ship, on the surface.
We were pulled into a warp funnel.

34:59.013 --> 35:03.975
That's just what I thought.
How are we communicating?

35:04.143 --> 35:06.311
We found a way
to send a subspace signal

35:06.479 --> 35:08.480
that could cut through
the atmospheric interference.

35:08.648 --> 35:10.774
DATA: Geordi, are you seeing
the image of your mother?

35:10.942 --> 35:12.526
Yes.

35:12.693 --> 35:15.028
And she's just confirmed
everything I've been saying.

35:15.196 --> 35:18.573
I am reading unusual
subspace energy in your vicinity.

35:18.741 --> 35:20.450
Similar to what
the probe sensor recorded

35:20.618 --> 35:22.619
the first time
you encountered your mother.

35:22.787 --> 35:25.705
That's how
she's communicating with me.

35:25.873 --> 35:27.582
It's the only kind of signal
they could send

35:27.750 --> 35:29.543
that could cut through
the interference.

35:29.710 --> 35:31.336
We need your help.

35:31.504 --> 35:33.713
I've been thinking about this.

35:33.881 --> 35:37.342
I'm going to take the Raman
into a low stationary orbit

35:37.510 --> 35:39.803
and initiate an inverse
warp cascade.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.012
Why?

35:41.180 --> 35:43.223
The subspace distortion
from the cascade

35:43.391 --> 35:45.559
should reverse the warp funnel.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.978
Your ship will end up
right back where it started.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.814
Geordi, the atmosphere becomes
increasingly turbulent

35:50.982 --> 35:52.649
the farther down you go.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.359
You may not be able
to bring the Raman

35:54.527 --> 35:56.695
close enough to the Hera
before being destroyed.

35:56.863 --> 35:58.238
I have to try, Data.

35:58.447 --> 36:00.740
We're running out of time.

36:01.617 --> 36:03.785
Shields back online.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.831
We're starting our descent.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.167
Oh, thank God.

36:10.334 --> 36:13.211
- Thank God?
- That you're alive.

36:13.379 --> 36:16.423
That I was right about all of this.

36:16.591 --> 36:19.843
I can't wait to call Dad.
He and Ariana had given up.

36:20.011 --> 36:25.098
- We're going home.
- Well, eventually, yeah.

36:25.266 --> 36:29.936
Data, everything's fading in and out.

36:30.104 --> 36:31.771
I'm losing the interface.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.982
The probe is descending
out of range.

36:34.192 --> 36:37.068
You'll have to turn up the input gain
to maintain my connection.

36:37.236 --> 36:39.696
We are already at 75 percent
of tolerance.

36:39.864 --> 36:42.616
Data, you can turn it
all the way up to a hundred

36:42.783 --> 36:44.576
if you do it slowly enough.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.037
Give my nervous system
a chance to adjust.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.872
That is theoretically true.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.290
But even at this level of input,

36:50.458 --> 36:53.960
you are already experiencing
dangerous neural feedback.

36:54.128 --> 36:56.671
There are over 300 people
onboard the Hera, Data.

36:56.881 --> 36:59.466
You and l
are the only chance they've got.

37:02.470 --> 37:05.972
I will increase the gain incrementally
as you descend.

37:10.645 --> 37:11.853
It's working.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.231
When we are ready
to disconnect the interface,

37:14.398 --> 37:17.192
we must allow enough time
to lower the input levels.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.277
Otherwise, your nervous system
will go into shock

37:19.445 --> 37:20.904
from the sudden drop in input.

37:21.072 --> 37:24.491
Well, once I initiate the warp cascade,
we can start dropping the gain.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.409
DATA:
Understood.

37:26.869 --> 37:31.039
We'll be within sensor range
of the Hera in a few minutes.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.084
Mom.

37:34.669 --> 37:38.380
I'm really sorry I didn't get by
to see you a couple of weeks ago.

37:38.547 --> 37:41.341
You were too busy with work.

37:42.176 --> 37:44.135
Yeah, well, l'm sorry.

37:44.303 --> 37:46.680
It won't happen again.

37:50.351 --> 37:54.437
Captain, the Raman is descending
toward the planet.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.482
Geordi.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.609
We are at 90 percent of tolerance.

37:59.777 --> 38:03.196
My calculations show you will reach
1 00 percent of tolerance

38:03.364 --> 38:05.365
before you are in range of the Hera.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.492
Then we're gonna have to go
beyond tolerance.

38:07.660 --> 38:11.204
That would not be advisable.
You must cease your descent.

38:11.414 --> 38:14.666
No, Geordi, don't. Please.

38:16.335 --> 38:19.796
Data, I'm taking this ship down.

38:19.964 --> 38:23.883
Now, if you don't boost the gain
past tolerance levels,

38:24.051 --> 38:25.969
I'll lose the interface
when we go out of range

38:26.137 --> 38:27.804
and my system will go into shock.

38:27.972 --> 38:31.224
Geordi, you are putting me
in a difficult position.

38:31.726 --> 38:34.060
Please, cease your descent.

38:34.228 --> 38:36.229
I won't do it, Data.

38:36.397 --> 38:38.231
You're gonna have to increase
the tolerance.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.405
Disengaging safety systems.

38:45.573 --> 38:48.700
Going to full tolerance levels now.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.911
Thank you, Data.

38:53.706 --> 38:57.167
- We're getting close.
- Thank God.

38:57.918 --> 39:00.920
PICARD: Commander La Forge.
- Yes, captain?

39:01.088 --> 39:04.090
Stop your descent.
Prepare to disengage the interface.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.134
Sorry, captain, but I can't do that.

39:06.302 --> 39:08.595
Damn it, Geordi,
you're gonna kill yourself.

39:08.763 --> 39:11.181
If I come back now,
my mother and her entire crew will die.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.268
I'm scanning for your ship.

39:16.479 --> 39:18.772
I'm not getting anything.

39:18.939 --> 39:24.027
- We're still too far away.
- No, not really.

39:24.945 --> 39:28.114
I should be picking
something up by now.

39:29.825 --> 39:31.993
I'm not finding anything.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.913
There's no warp funnel.

39:35.289 --> 39:36.831
No ship.

39:38.292 --> 39:40.543
There's nothing there.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.092
PICARD:
Doctor, report.

39:47.259 --> 39:49.886
His neural synapses are overloading.
He can't survive this.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.513
Geordi, what's happening to you?

39:51.722 --> 39:54.808
Reverse tractor beam.

39:55.351 --> 39:57.685
DATA:
Reversing tractor beam.

40:11.659 --> 40:13.410
What are you?

40:13.577 --> 40:16.579
You're killing us. We must go down.

40:17.331 --> 40:19.124
PICARD:
Geordi.

40:19.291 --> 40:21.167
What's happening? Report.

40:21.377 --> 40:24.045
You're trapped?

40:24.255 --> 40:26.256
Is there any way
that we can disconnect him?

40:26.882 --> 40:30.135
If we take him off too abruptly,
he'll go into neural shock.

40:30.928 --> 40:32.053
Caught on the ship?

40:32.805 --> 40:35.598
Reduce the input gradually
and still get him out before it's too late.

40:35.766 --> 40:39.144
Are you saying
that you killed the Raman's crew?

40:39.311 --> 40:41.187
Perhaps we could deceive
his neural receptors.

40:41.397 --> 40:43.857
- Deceive them?
- By feeding them sensory information

40:44.024 --> 40:46.234
recorded from his earlier experiences
with the probe.

40:46.402 --> 40:50.029
We could disconnect the interface
and still maintain the input levels.

40:50.197 --> 40:52.198
We could then lower them
in a controlled manner.

40:52.366 --> 40:53.700
What do you want?

40:54.326 --> 40:57.412
- Like a decompression tank. Let's try.
LA FORGE: Then it was an accident?

40:57.580 --> 41:00.874
Captain, l have to take the ship
into the lower atmosphere.

41:01.041 --> 41:02.125
Explain.

41:02.293 --> 41:03.376
As I understand it,

41:03.544 --> 41:05.044
when the Raman
got close to the planet,

41:05.212 --> 41:07.839
it accidentally picked up
some life forms

41:08.007 --> 41:09.883
that live in the lower atmosphere.

41:10.050 --> 41:13.219
Subspace beings of some kind.
Intelligent.

41:13.429 --> 41:15.555
When the ship went back
into a higher orbit,

41:15.764 --> 41:16.973
the beings were trapped.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.516
How do you know all this?

41:18.684 --> 41:20.518
One of them
can communicate with me.

41:20.686 --> 41:23.021
It must have read my thoughts
through the probe interface

41:23.189 --> 41:25.356
and took the form of my mother.

41:25.524 --> 41:28.234
To try to talk me into taking the ship
closer to the surface.

41:28.402 --> 41:31.321
Are these beings responsible
for the deaths of the Raman's crew?

41:31.489 --> 41:34.449
LA FORGE: Yes,
but I don't think it was on purpose.

41:34.617 --> 41:36.534
They probably tried
communicating with them

41:36.702 --> 41:39.662
the same way
they're communicating with me,

41:39.830 --> 41:41.873
by directly accessing their thoughts.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.917
It must have been fatal to the crew.

41:44.084 --> 41:47.879
I guess the interface
is what protected me.

41:48.047 --> 41:50.548
I have to take them back, captain.

41:50.716 --> 41:54.093
They can't survive
so far up in the atmosphere.

41:54.261 --> 41:58.181
I'll turn the ship around
and come back just as soon as I--

41:58.349 --> 41:59.641
[GRUNTS]

41:59.808 --> 42:00.934
Geordi, what's happening?

42:01.101 --> 42:03.102
LA FORGE: The atmosphere
is getting more turbulent.

42:03.270 --> 42:04.896
It's overloading the systems.

42:05.064 --> 42:07.065
[ALARM WAILlNG

42:07.233 --> 42:09.734
I'm having difficulty
keeping the shields up.

42:09.902 --> 42:11.611
SILVA:
Geordi.

42:12.196 --> 42:14.280
We're safe now.

42:14.823 --> 42:16.491
Goodbye.

42:28.379 --> 42:31.214
[ALARM WAILlNG

42:32.132 --> 42:33.633
I'm losing power.

42:35.302 --> 42:37.470
Total shield failure in eight seconds.

42:37.638 --> 42:40.431
- Can we switch the inputs?
- Almost.

42:42.935 --> 42:44.018
Shields are failing.

42:46.730 --> 42:48.815
Switching inputs.

42:52.236 --> 42:53.528
[GROANING

42:57.825 --> 42:58.866
Is it working?

42:59.785 --> 43:02.996
His vital signs are stabilizing.
He's going to make it.

43:07.418 --> 43:09.252
PICARD:
Captain's log, supplemental.

43:09.420 --> 43:12.755
We have succeeded in disengaging
Mr. La Forge from the interface

43:12.923 --> 43:16.301
and are en route to Starbase 495.

43:16.468 --> 43:18.636
You disobeyed my direct order.

43:18.804 --> 43:21.931
You put yourself in grave danger.
I am not happy.

43:22.099 --> 43:23.182
Yes, sir.

43:23.350 --> 43:26.311
I take complete responsibility.
Data was only--

43:26.478 --> 43:29.022
I will deal with Mr. Data
at another time.

43:29.189 --> 43:31.024
Meanwhile,
I will have to write this incident

43:31.191 --> 43:32.859
into your permanent record.

43:33.902 --> 43:36.571
- Yes, sir.
- Dismissed.

43:37.698 --> 43:39.198
Geordi?

43:42.119 --> 43:44.537
I'm very sorry
that you didn't find your mother.

43:46.790 --> 43:48.625
Thank you, sir.

43:49.918 --> 43:53.087
You know, it's funny,
when I was down there,

43:53.631 --> 43:55.798
it was so real.

43:57.676 --> 44:00.553
I felt like
I had a chance to say goodbye.
