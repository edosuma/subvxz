 NAAZIM RICHARDSON: Every human
being that comes to this planet

00:38.939 --> 00:41.573
          has a fight.

00:41.575 --> 00:44.943
     The ultimate opponent
       is actually truth.

00:44.945 --> 00:48.047
      The truth will wean
      out everything else.

00:48.049 --> 00:52.017
  -Fighting for your identity
  or for who you are for real

00:52.019 --> 00:55.154
     is one of the hardest
     things you have to do.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.889
       -Boxing, I think,
       is conquering not

00:56.891 --> 00:58.991
      only your opponent,
         but yourself.

00:58.993 --> 01:01.093
         You've got to
      transcend your fear

01:01.095 --> 01:03.162
      and reach deep down
        to a part of you

01:03.164 --> 01:05.129
        that you may not
      even know is there.

01:12.807 --> 01:14.406
     RON HOWARD: The heroic
        nature of boxing

01:14.408 --> 01:16.475
is something that's undeniable.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.610
        There is skill,
       there's expertise,

01:18.612 --> 01:23.782
    but there's always this
possibility of tremendous loss.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.151
   DENZEL WASHINGTON: Boxing
   is just the anticipation.

01:26.153 --> 01:29.054
       It's one punch and
      it's all over with.

01:29.056 --> 01:32.124
       -A lucky punch can
    turn a guy into a star.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.226
        And being caught
     when he's not looking

01:34.228 --> 01:37.529
      could turn a star to
      a shadow of himself.

01:37.531 --> 01:40.466
        [music playing]

01:43.904 --> 01:46.538
-Rich kids don't go into boxing.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.674
        Boxing is a way
       out of the ghetto.

01:48.676 --> 01:51.810
     One minute, a boxer is
     not getting anything.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.679
     The next minute, he's
       signing a contract

01:53.681 --> 01:54.746
    for millions of dollars.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.815
    How do you handle that?

01:56.817 --> 01:59.685
 LOU DIBELLA: The sport itself,
    there's a purity to it.

01:59.687 --> 02:01.186
        But the business
       might be the most

02:01.188 --> 02:03.522
 unsanitized of all businesses.

02:03.524 --> 02:06.091
    -Boxing is one of those
   sports where the toughest

02:06.093 --> 02:08.460
 motherfuckers in the world are
letting some guys that couldn't

02:08.461 --> 02:11.062
make it take advantage of them.

02:11.065 --> 02:13.065
      LOU DIBELLA: It's a
   reflection of our society

02:13.067 --> 02:16.435
        and your ability
       to achieve dreams,

02:16.437 --> 02:19.204
   but it's also a reflection
  of our society and the fact

02:19.206 --> 02:21.907
   that we are unquestionably
   divided between the haves

02:21.909 --> 02:23.642
       and the have nots.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.178
       -It's not an easy
     way to make a living,

02:26.180 --> 02:29.248
       and it's the most
   dangerous sport there is.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.883
 But that's the risk you take.

02:56.577 --> 03:00.345
      -I'm the youngest of
       nine in my family.

03:00.347 --> 03:03.515
       As you can see, a
       black little boy.

03:03.517 --> 03:11.823
      Black and came from
   people call it the ghetto.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.693
     My mother didn't read,
     my father didn't read,

03:14.695 --> 03:18.063
 and so they were hard workers.

03:18.065 --> 03:22.367
   And that was my beginning.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.569
        When you live in
       a project, people

03:23.571 --> 03:26.338
throw their trash on the ground.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.073
       We were the family
     that picked the trash

03:28.075 --> 03:30.442
 up and put it in the dumpster.

03:30.444 --> 03:33.812
     And people looked and
       would laugh at us.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.048
   My mother said, you know,
 you live in this environment.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.850
You don't have to be like that.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.587
       Of course, people
       had money and they

03:41.589 --> 03:43.989
        used their money
       in the wrong way.

03:43.991 --> 03:48.293
        My mother didn't
      buy clothes or toys.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.595
        She bought food.

03:49.597 --> 03:52.864
   She knew that this is what
  we need to be able to live.

03:56.103 --> 04:01.306
  -My upbringing, it was four
    sisters, three brothers.

04:01.308 --> 04:04.009
   Coming out of Philadelphia
       is a task itself,

04:04.011 --> 04:06.745
    especially in the inner
   city called North Philly.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.184
    In the morning, we'd get
  up to my mother saying, OK.

04:12.186 --> 04:14.653
     Get up, get ready for
     school, this and that.

04:14.655 --> 04:18.957
 You had to ration out two cans
of pork and beans with six kids

04:18.959 --> 04:20.759
         and try to mix
      other stuff in there

04:20.761 --> 04:22.661
to call it something different.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.896
       Mom, it's the same
        pork and beans.

04:24.898 --> 04:28.267
  It's just got other meats in
it that make it something else.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.702
    My father was one of the
  guys that got up every day,

04:30.704 --> 04:32.971
     did what he had to do.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.307
     I never seen him sell
   drugs, anything like that,

04:35.309 --> 04:37.542
 but I know that he used drugs.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.711
     I know that he drank.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.914
    So I had the two parent
    structure in the house,

04:42.916 --> 04:48.754
      but it was a family
      where we was tight,

04:48.756 --> 04:51.223
      but there were some
       things that wasn't

04:51.225 --> 04:54.159
        as I would say a
    normal family would be.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.202
   -The worst characteristics
 you could think of black life

05:04.204 --> 05:05.304
     is where I stem from.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.472
        A lot of drugs.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.074
       Tons of violence.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.076
     My parents sold women.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.246
      They were in the sex
      industry and stuff.

05:14.248 --> 05:17.416
     That's what they did.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.584
 We weren't safe in the house.

05:19.586 --> 05:22.921
   We were always vulnerable.

05:22.923 --> 05:29.661
    A lot of men sleep with
      my sister, beat me.

05:29.663 --> 05:33.498
    -There was a pattern of
  abuse that Mike experienced.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.967
  Bullies in the neighborhood
   which routinely would pick

05:35.969 --> 05:40.639
     on him, but also Mike
   was beaten by his mother.

05:40.641 --> 05:43.675
         His father was
      pretty much absent.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.243
    MIKE TYSON: My mother's
       very promiscuous.

05:45.245 --> 05:50.515
 It was just the way life was.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.384
      Everybody I knew had
   just their mother at home

05:52.386 --> 05:54.052
  or their mother's boyfriend.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.221
Nobody was ever with his father.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.456
    I don't know that world.

05:57.458 --> 06:01.860
  My whole world is just lost
    kids with broken homes.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.095
   You know, forget poverty.

06:03.097 --> 06:05.430
     I don't care how much
    money you get, or game.

06:05.432 --> 06:06.565
          Forget that.

06:06.567 --> 06:10.035
    Poverty hurts and leaves
     an everlasting effect,

06:10.037 --> 06:10.836
       impression on you.

06:16.577 --> 06:20.379
      -Poverty has its own
    self perpetuating logic.

06:20.381 --> 06:23.382
     When you are strapped
        for cash and you

06:23.384 --> 06:25.450
        need to survive
       in the short term,

06:25.452 --> 06:29.421
   you start to adopt certain
practices that in the long term

06:29.423 --> 06:32.124
   end up preventing you from
    taking advantage of all

06:32.126 --> 06:35.026
     the opportunities that
   may be out there for you.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.595
       -We came in on the
      era where it really

06:36.597 --> 06:41.633
   got a little worse, where
      nobody had anything.

06:41.635 --> 06:44.102
  You couldn't tease me about
   my mother being on welfare

06:44.104 --> 06:46.505
      because your mother
        was on welfare.

06:46.507 --> 06:47.873
     JOHN PFAFF: Childhood
       poverty oftentimes

06:47.875 --> 06:51.710
  leads to adult poverty, and
 you get locked in these ruts.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.112
     So not only are these
      worse environments,

06:54.114 --> 06:57.015
     but they find it much
       harder to escape.

06:57.017 --> 07:00.218
  All these ills work together
 to create very strong barriers

07:00.220 --> 07:02.854
    to upward mobility, and
   very hard to still believe

07:02.856 --> 07:04.256
the American dream is out there.

07:04.258 --> 07:07.426
-The American dream is something
that we're all proud of, we all

07:07.428 --> 07:10.529
      embrace, yet it's a
     little bit dangerous.

07:10.531 --> 07:14.065
   America may be one of the
richest countries in the world,

07:14.067 --> 07:16.868
        but we also have
      the largest pockets

07:16.870 --> 07:19.971
       of poverty in the
      developed countries.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.340
      One in five children
      in the United States

07:22.342 --> 07:24.209
      grows up in poverty.

07:24.211 --> 07:28.046
    America has, by far, the
   most unequal distribution

07:28.048 --> 07:30.649
      of income and wealth
    in the developed world.

07:30.651 --> 07:35.353
 Yet, the idea of the American
     Dream is, in a sense,

07:35.355 --> 07:37.088
      what keeps the whole
        system running.

07:40.194 --> 07:43.495
 -I know what it is when people
move away from you because they

07:43.497 --> 07:46.798
    think that they're gonna
      catch what you got.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.735
  They think they're gonna get
 poor if they get to know you.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.504
       -I was just always
    searching for something.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.539
        I didn't like my
       life at home, so I

07:54.541 --> 07:56.141
        wanted to have a
     family somewhere else.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.944
 I tried to find a new family.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.612
    BERNARD HOPKINS: People
       that I hung around

08:00.614 --> 08:03.081
        was in the same
    situation that I was in.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.916
      You went on like you
      was going to school,

08:04.918 --> 08:10.055
 but in reality, we was in the
area, but not in the classroom.

08:10.057 --> 08:14.326
  We stayed around the school,
but not actually in the school.

08:14.328 --> 08:18.096
   And eventually, people do
  find out, but after a while,

08:18.098 --> 08:21.099
  you get lost in the system.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.168
        -When I went to
       school, they said

08:23.170 --> 08:24.503
  we wasn't gonna be anything.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.204
        They said, we're
      gonna be statistics.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.106
     You're not articulate.

08:28.108 --> 08:31.142
    You don't know your ABCs
     and the simple stuff.

08:31.144 --> 08:34.379
   And my mom always said, so
   they read better than you.

08:34.381 --> 08:37.115
       Who's the fastest
        in your school?

08:37.116 --> 08:38.650
    I said fastest at what?

08:38.652 --> 08:39.951
       She said, running.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.020
      Who run the fastest?

08:42.022 --> 08:43.722
      I outran everybody.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.857
My mom says, there's things that
you do better than that person.

08:45.859 --> 08:49.394
    I said, but momma, they
     don't talk about that.

08:49.396 --> 08:50.729
      Your day will come.

08:50.731 --> 08:55.066
   -My goal wasn't to be the
president of the United States.

08:55.068 --> 09:02.874
     My goal was to be the
   baddest guy that I can be.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.609
       We just basically
        looked at school

09:04.611 --> 09:09.981
  as being no fun, no action,
 and if you do catch us there,

09:09.983 --> 09:12.384
     it's gym where we get
      to play basketball.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.419
        We could just do
     things that we thought

09:14.421 --> 09:16.154
    was more important than
     reading, and writing,

09:16.156 --> 09:17.923
   and science, and history.

09:20.594 --> 09:21.826
     MIKE TYSON: I stopped
        going to school

09:21.828 --> 09:23.361
      because people were
        kicking my ass.

09:23.363 --> 09:26.064
     I just walk around the
   school 'til school is over

09:26.066 --> 09:28.033
     because I didn't wanna
       get my ass kicked.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.335
      One day, these guys
        came around me.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.636
      Three or four guys.

09:31.638 --> 09:33.471
   They pinned me up against
  the wall and they say, hey.

09:33.473 --> 09:34.039
              Yo.

09:34.041 --> 09:34.573
         Got any money?

09:34.575 --> 09:35.273
          I said, no.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.441
     So the guy says this.

09:36.443 --> 09:39.244
      He said, uh, do you
       wanna fly with us?

09:39.246 --> 09:40.111
     And I didn't know him.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.313
    It's a kid, 10 or nine.

09:41.315 --> 09:42.881
        I'm saying, OK.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.816
      So I'm helping these
     guys to this building.

09:44.818 --> 09:45.984
        This is like an
      abandoned building.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.953
        And I see a box,
       and it's pigeons.

09:47.955 --> 09:48.820
    And pigeons are flying.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.655
     I said, what the hell.

09:50.657 --> 09:51.923
       Now I know there's
        a place to hang

09:51.925 --> 09:53.358
 out with birds and these guys.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.659
         So I said, OK.

09:54.661 --> 09:57.195
  I'd rather be there than be
   in school and get bullied.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.097
  So I went back to the coop.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.199
       I said, need me to
      do anything for you.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.367
        They said, yeah.

10:02.369 --> 10:06.605
 And he took me robbing houses.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.140
          And-- Whoa.

10:09.142 --> 10:13.612
       And he didn't give
         me much money,

10:13.614 --> 10:14.546
   but he bought me clothes.

10:20.721 --> 10:21.586
     He bought me clothes.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.791
   LARRY SLOMAN: There are a
  number of reasons, I think,

10:26.793 --> 10:29.394
         why he kind of
    embraced the thug life.

10:29.396 --> 10:32.564
  One of which is, if you have
   a community of people who

10:32.566 --> 10:36.101
  are watching your back, then
 you're going to be protected.

10:36.103 --> 10:39.604
    And now he's buying the
   coolest velour sweatsuits,

10:39.606 --> 10:42.674
and he's buying ski goggles even
though he's never been anywhere

10:42.676 --> 10:46.211
   near a ski slope, and he's
   buying the greatest kicks.

10:46.213 --> 10:50.215
       So now, status in
        that environment

10:50.217 --> 10:52.417
   is who looks the coolest.

10:52.419 --> 10:56.254
-The role models that I've seen
 was the people in the street.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.890
     The pimps, the number
     writers, the hustlers.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.859
       They had the cars,
     they had the jewelry,

11:00.861 --> 11:05.163
    they had all the things
    that shine in your face.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.400
       As you grow up and
       you grow up fast,

11:08.402 --> 11:13.538
  you get to know what they're
  doing is not right, but got

11:13.540 --> 11:16.508
 them a lot of things and made
 them live different or better

11:16.510 --> 11:20.779
    than every working class
     person in the streets.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.080
       NAAZIM RICHARDSON:
      That's the situation

11:22.082 --> 11:24.816
       for a lot of young
       people out there.

11:24.818 --> 11:27.585
    They could step off the
   porch with all the values

11:27.587 --> 11:29.954
  in the world their mom gave
  them and dad can give them.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.290
    When they step off that
      porch into that den,

11:32.292 --> 11:34.526
      they've got to deal
      with it accordingly.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.561
 You can go out there and turn
the other cheek if you want to.

11:36.563 --> 11:37.996
      All they're gonna do
     is hit you in the head

11:37.998 --> 11:39.497
   and take that earring too.

11:39.499 --> 11:42.233
      So you had to adapt.

11:42.235 --> 11:47.806
  Those that adapt well become
predators out there themselves.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.909
    BERNARD HOPKINS: To me,
    it wasn't a hard choice.

11:50.911 --> 11:55.080
  I was the type of guy had no
 conscience of value of my life

11:55.082 --> 11:57.215
and repercussions of what I do.

11:57.217 --> 12:01.119
      When you think that
     the value of your life

12:01.121 --> 12:05.356
       it's not that much
    concern on your actions,

12:05.358 --> 12:09.661
      then that is a time
     bomb waiting to blow.

12:09.663 --> 12:11.629
CURTIS JACKSON: Ain't no rules.

12:11.631 --> 12:13.364
         You don't get
    disqualified for busting

12:13.366 --> 12:15.166
        a nigga over the
      head with something.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.068
       When you get hurt
     back, either your fear

12:17.070 --> 12:21.306
      consumes you or you
   become a bit insensitive.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.874
        Either you gonna
       be a punk, or you

12:22.876 --> 12:25.477
   gonna start to harden up a
   little bit following that.

12:25.479 --> 12:27.645
  However you handle yourself,
  you make it clear to people

12:27.647 --> 12:30.615
      that you don't have
       a problem with it.

12:30.617 --> 12:33.952
   Matter of fact, make them
  feel like you want the shit.

12:33.954 --> 12:37.856
   -In an environment that I
 grew up in, which was animal,

12:37.858 --> 12:41.626
   which was survival of the
 fittest, which was do or die,

12:41.628 --> 12:43.962
   you have to be strategic.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.130
       NAAZIM RICHARDSON:
         Very few of us

12:45.132 --> 12:47.332
        grow up in fear,
    because we live in this,

12:47.334 --> 12:49.901
     and we're taught early
   we can't be afraid of it.

12:49.903 --> 12:53.571
 Whenever we're confronted with
   an obstacle in the streets

12:53.573 --> 12:57.008
   of a physical nature, the
    first thing we think of

12:57.010 --> 12:59.844
is how to dissect the obstacle.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.828
       -My dream started
        off with a coach

13:16.830 --> 13:20.231
     told me I could be the
      heavyweight champion

13:20.233 --> 13:21.065
         of the world.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.967
 And I asked him, what was it.

13:22.969 --> 13:26.237
   And he said, Muhammad Ali.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.072
        He said, do you
       know Muhammad Ali.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.574
         I said, yeah.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.176
     And he said, you could
       be just like that.

13:35.649 --> 13:39.350
      First goal was to be
      the Boys Club champ.

13:39.352 --> 13:43.288
 I wanted to be great, because
I already know how it feels not

13:43.290 --> 13:45.490
      to be great, because
        I grew up in it.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.662
     In one fight, I became
      the Boys Club champ.

13:53.433 --> 13:57.569
      Every year, I would
      win the tournament.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.771
    DALTON CONLEY: Boxing's
    interesting in that it's

13:59.773 --> 14:02.941
       an escape from the
      violence and poverty

14:02.943 --> 14:05.243
        of many American
   neighborhoods, but you're

14:05.245 --> 14:07.345
        escaping through
        violence itself.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.514
       -People who fight
      fight their way out

14:09.516 --> 14:12.450
   of something, whether it's
  poverty, whether it's jail.

14:12.452 --> 14:13.518
     Rich kids don't fight.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.020
       Why the fuck would
       a rich kid fight?

14:16.022 --> 14:17.655
        Poor kids fight.

14:17.657 --> 14:20.391
     You want to fight your
   way to a different place.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.726
      AL BERNSTEIN: Boxing
       gives you a chance

14:21.728 --> 14:23.728
       to literally fight
      your way through it.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.698
      Boxers succeed based
       on their own work.

14:26.700 --> 14:30.134
  If you keep winning, and you
 keep succeeding, chances are,

14:30.136 --> 14:32.737
    eventually, you're going
     to get an opportunity.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.772
    GEORGE WILLIS: Boxing is
  the ultimate representation

14:34.774 --> 14:36.608
     of the American dream.

14:36.610 --> 14:42.680
It allows someone who came from
 nothing to achieve greatness.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.250
         It's about his
     talent, his own skill,

14:45.252 --> 14:47.352
   and his own determination.

14:47.354 --> 14:48.887
     MARK WAHLBERG: Boxing
    is such a special sport.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.655
      I think most people
      don't choose boxing.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.123
  I think boxing chooses them.

14:52.125 --> 14:55.226
    Disadvantaged childhood,
      less fortunate kids

14:55.228 --> 14:56.928
     in tough communities.

14:56.930 --> 15:00.198
     And we grew up boxing
       at the Boys Club.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.100
    We were able to go there
      and we had somebody

15:02.102 --> 15:04.402
 who cared about us, who wanted
   to take us off the streets

15:04.404 --> 15:05.603
  and give us something to do.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.139
  -If you look at the history
      of boxing over time,

15:08.141 --> 15:11.609
     you'll see some of the
 cultures and ethnicities that

15:11.611 --> 15:13.111
       have suffered the
        most have always

15:13.113 --> 15:15.213
produced the greatest champions.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.749
     DALTON CONLEY: Boxing
    both attracts and preys

15:17.751 --> 15:21.853
        upon talent from
   disadvantaged communities.

15:21.855 --> 15:24.722
    And it's almost like you
  can read a chart of history

15:24.724 --> 15:27.725
 of disadvantage, in the United
   States, at least, of which

15:27.727 --> 15:30.962
groups are struggling to make it
and then which groups have made

15:30.964 --> 15:34.232
    it when they disappear,
 really, from the boxing scene.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.000
  -Especially in America where
    you had the immigrants.

15:36.002 --> 15:39.203
       You had the Jewish
   boxers, the Irish boxers,

15:39.205 --> 15:42.540
  the Italian American boxers,
    African American boxers.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.108
       Now it's, I would
       say, predominantly

15:44.110 --> 15:46.144
      Hispanic boxers now.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.745
     LARRY SLOMAN: There's
      a certain generation

15:47.747 --> 15:50.515
         with Mike, and
     Evander, and Bernard.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.750
         Black kids who
       were disadvantaged

15:52.752 --> 15:56.888
  and saw boxing as a way out.

15:56.890 --> 15:58.723
   EVANDER HOLYFIELD: I lived
  in an all black neighborhood

15:58.725 --> 16:02.961
    and everybody said white
      boys couldn't fight.

16:02.963 --> 16:06.898
    And that's my first time
 experiencing that people tell

16:06.900 --> 16:11.970
 you lies, because that kid was
  white and he beat me twice.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.973
 I told the coach that I quit.

16:14.975 --> 16:17.275
Told him I didn't want to fight
anymore, because I didn't think

16:17.277 --> 16:20.912
     you could actually be
    a champion if you lost.

16:20.914 --> 16:26.084
  So I went home told my momma
 I lost, and I told her I quit.

16:26.086 --> 16:32.156
 And she told me something that
 has impacted my life even now.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.491
         She said, son.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.894
    Everything is not gonna
      always go your way.

16:36.896 --> 16:39.464
   If you quit, you'll never
    reach your destination.

16:39.466 --> 16:42.066
       She said, what is
       your destination.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.602
   I said, be the heavyweight
     champion of the world.

16:44.604 --> 16:48.272
     Of course, I went back
    and I finally beat him,

16:48.274 --> 16:54.445
 and that fight kind of changed
 my whole aspect about winning.

16:58.918 --> 17:01.853
   MIKE TYSON: I kept getting
    in trouble with the law.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.488
      One particular time,
        I got in trouble

17:03.490 --> 17:06.324
  and I went upstate New York.

17:06.326 --> 17:10.194
     I had a reputation as
     a troublemaker there.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.130
       I had to be locked
     down most of the time.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.265
     I couldn't go outside
   with the rest of the kids.

17:14.267 --> 17:17.702
     Weekends, I would see
   guys go on the other side.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.869
        And I would say,
        what's going on,

17:18.872 --> 17:20.771
      because I would see
       guys coming back,

17:20.773 --> 17:23.907
      swollen eyes, busted
       nose, busted lips.

17:23.910 --> 17:27.578
The most interesting thing about
  it is that they were happy.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.147
      When they would come
   back, they're all beat up,

17:29.149 --> 17:30.248
       but they're happy.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.984
    And I would say, what's
      going on over there.

17:32.986 --> 17:36.054
   And they said, Mr. Stewart
  is boxing with the inmates.

17:36.056 --> 17:41.225
  Mr. Stewart is probably 160
    pounds, white Irish guy.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.860
     I never fought before
        with gloves on,

17:42.862 --> 17:44.629
  but I just knew I could beat
    Mr. Stewart's white ass.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.498
 I just knew I could beat him.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.235
   I'm just flaring away, and
  he had hit me in my stomach,

17:51.237 --> 17:53.571
         and I had went
      down, and I started

17:53.573 --> 17:55.706
     throwing up everything
      I ate for two days.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.041
          Just blech.

17:57.043 --> 18:00.211
       So I asked him to
       start teaching me.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.779
       He wouldn't teach
      me unless I started

18:01.781 --> 18:03.481
behaving around the facilities.

18:03.483 --> 18:06.784
    And once I made my honor
  rolls and started doing well

18:06.786 --> 18:08.953
     in school, he started
    teaching me how to box.

18:08.955 --> 18:12.090
   -Bobby Stewart immediately
   saw the potential in Mike,

18:12.092 --> 18:14.258
   and Bobby said, if you're
      serious about this,

18:14.260 --> 18:17.728
      I'll take you to see
   this old guy in Catskill.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.964
          -Soon as Cus
      D'Amato saw me spar,

18:19.966 --> 18:22.500
       he was planning my
        life out for me.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.502
      First day he met me.

18:24.504 --> 18:27.338
     LARRY SLOMAN: Cus was
      a kind of gruff guy.

18:27.340 --> 18:30.608
 He didn't display any emotion.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.277
  At the end of this session,
 Cus turned to Bobby and said,

18:33.279 --> 18:35.079
   this guy's going to be the
  future heavyweight champion

18:35.081 --> 18:36.280
         of the world.

18:39.085 --> 18:42.320
MIKE TYSON: At that time, I was
about to be paroled back to New

18:42.322 --> 18:44.822
  York, and he didn't want me
 to go back because he believed

18:44.824 --> 18:46.891
    I would get in trouble,
        I'd get killed.

18:46.893 --> 18:49.026
     He asked me would I be
interested in staying with him.

18:49.028 --> 18:51.562
     And I said, why, sure.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.532
I didn't want to go back to the
 disgusting, wretched tenements

18:54.534 --> 18:57.168
       that we lived in.

18:57.170 --> 19:01.672
    This guy had a wonderful
     like 14 room mansion.

19:01.674 --> 19:02.640
        Roses and stuff.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.208
    I never saw that stuff.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.844
     LARRY SLOMAN: For the
   beginning of that period,

19:06.846 --> 19:11.149
         Mike was still
     living in two worlds.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.717
        While he was in
       Brownsville, he'd

19:12.719 --> 19:14.085
      fall in with his old
       friends and they'd

19:14.087 --> 19:16.020
   go out and start jostling.

19:16.022 --> 19:18.322
      Mike's first street
        mentor, this guy

19:18.324 --> 19:21.826
     Barqueem, I think they
   saw some pictures of Mike

19:21.828 --> 19:25.329
 with Cus and with Camille, and
 they looked, and he said, man.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.964
   Mike, these white people.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.799
  It looks like they love you.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.334
   And Mike said, yeah, yeah.

19:30.336 --> 19:31.702
         They love me.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.472
  And he goes-- Barqueem says,
 what are you doing here, man.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.040
         If I had white
     people that loved me,

19:36.042 --> 19:37.742
 I wouldn't stick around here.

19:37.744 --> 19:38.910
        And everybody in
        the neighborhood

19:38.912 --> 19:40.611
      is telling Mike, go.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.280
        Get out of here.

19:42.282 --> 19:46.584
At least 30% of all the families
  in Brownsville at that time

19:46.586 --> 19:49.220
     had no father figures.

19:49.222 --> 19:50.755
     DAVID LEONARD: I think
    when we look at boxing,

19:50.757 --> 19:53.824
        we see a number
       of men who grew up

19:53.826 --> 19:56.627
 without a father in the home.

19:56.629 --> 20:00.598
    But what's key is, they
    grew up in circumstances

20:00.600 --> 20:03.234
where the family was redefined.

20:03.236 --> 20:08.372
  The trainers became part of
  this larger extended family.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.575
  LARRY SLOMAN: Cus would tell
  Mike that he was a colossus.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.476
        He was a titan.

20:12.478 --> 20:16.314
   And he's telling him this
    and building up his ego

20:16.316 --> 20:19.150
      to a person who has
   absolutely no self esteem.

20:19.152 --> 20:20.851
So it's a very tricky situation.

20:23.122 --> 20:24.555
      MICKY WARD: I heard
    about this heavy weight

20:24.557 --> 20:26.224
     that they were saying,
     this guy is dangerous.

20:26.226 --> 20:29.927
He's from Cus D'Amato's camp and
he was trained by Kevin Rooney.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.929
      When I finally seen
     him, I was like, man.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.865
      He was like-- He was
     going through fighters

20:34.867 --> 20:39.804
  like a hot knife on butter.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.773
      From that moment on,
    we knew he was special.

20:49.616 --> 20:52.083
 BERNARD HOPKINS: North Philly
was known for a lot of fighters

20:52.085 --> 20:56.287
       back in the '60s,
     '70s, and in the '80s.

20:56.289 --> 21:00.057
    I got introduced to the
amateurs, and I had the talent,

21:00.059 --> 21:01.492
       I had the skills.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.961
        But then as time
     went on, eventually I

21:03.963 --> 21:06.998
    started getting respect
      as a street fighter

21:07.000 --> 21:10.001
  and I shot away from boxing.

21:10.003 --> 21:14.005
   Every time I got stabbed,
which was more than once, crazy

21:14.007 --> 21:19.510
   as it might seem, it gave
   more stock to who you are.

21:29.756 --> 21:35.893
     In 1984, I was put in
     jail for taking money.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.728
        At that time, I
       blamed the system

21:37.730 --> 21:41.265
      for everything, even
       for my ignorance.

21:41.267 --> 21:44.669
   That same year, my brother
   got in a fight and the guy

21:44.671 --> 21:45.970
       pulled a gun out.

21:45.972 --> 21:46.904
        He tried to run.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.172
          He got shot.

21:48.174 --> 21:50.007
 They couldn't find him because
    he ran down the street,

21:50.009 --> 21:53.377
  and when they found him, he
  was laying across the grass.

21:53.379 --> 21:54.478
   So can you imagine my mom?

21:54.480 --> 21:58.182
      It had to be hard on
      her to bury one son

21:58.184 --> 22:02.853
  and then get to see me being
   escorted by the sheriff's

22:02.855 --> 22:05.489
     department from prison
        to view the body

22:05.491 --> 22:07.491
  and then go back to prison.

22:07.493 --> 22:11.429
So basically, she lost two sons.

22:11.431 --> 22:15.866
      So 1984 was a really
       challenging year.

22:15.868 --> 22:18.769
        [music playing]

22:22.642 --> 22:25.009
       EVANDER HOLYFIELD:
     1984, Mike and myself,

22:25.011 --> 22:28.045
     we were both trying to
     make the Olympic team.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.381
   -There was a big emphasis
       placed back then,

22:30.383 --> 22:33.884
   especially on the idea of
    your amateur experience

22:33.886 --> 22:36.220
  and this Olympic experience.

22:36.222 --> 22:39.256
       It was very much a
     place where your worth

22:39.258 --> 22:41.425
  was going to be determined.

22:41.427 --> 22:43.527
      Holyfield and Tyson
       got an early taste

22:43.529 --> 22:46.497
     of what the other was
     about at the Olympics.

22:46.499 --> 22:50.101
      -That's when I got a
    chance to see him train.

22:50.103 --> 22:54.004
I'm one of the guys who kind of
 prides myself on working hard.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.741
       And when I worked
      in the gym with him

22:56.743 --> 23:02.313
and I'd seen all the things that
he would do, I was just amazed.

23:02.315 --> 23:04.315
   I was like, god, you know?

23:04.317 --> 23:06.050
             Shoot.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.151
         17 years old.

23:07.153 --> 23:08.953
     He's just a kid, man.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.988
      He's the only person
        in a gym that I

23:10.990 --> 23:14.024
 can admit that I worked with.

23:14.026 --> 23:18.195
     I didn't think nobody
      was gonna beat him.

23:18.197 --> 23:22.099
  -Mike unfortunately lost to
   a guy named Henry Tillman.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.334
 Didn't make the Olympic team.

23:23.336 --> 23:26.203
 He was voted as an alternate.

23:26.205 --> 23:27.638
     MIKE TYSON: I went to
      the Olympic trials.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.173
  I didn't make the Olympics,
       but the experience

23:29.175 --> 23:32.843
    in going to the Olympics
      was just incredible.

23:32.845 --> 23:35.913
   Evander Holyfield, he was
     just very competitive,

23:35.915 --> 23:38.682
because he was just very hungry.

23:38.684 --> 23:39.517
      Very hungry fighter.

23:39.519 --> 23:40.317
         And he fought.

23:40.319 --> 23:43.053
     It reminded me of me.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.522
      He was gonna win the
    most outstanding fight,

23:44.524 --> 23:46.157
   I thought, because he was
    knocking out everybody.

23:46.159 --> 23:49.593
He was beating everybody easily.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.829
 ANNOUNCER: Evander Holyfield,
   United States of America.

23:51.831 --> 23:54.331
   Kevin Barry, New Zealand.

23:54.333 --> 23:57.435
      Holyfield came into
        the competition

23:57.437 --> 24:00.438
     the unknown American,
      but he's known now,

24:00.440 --> 24:02.807
  and he's only 21 years old.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.708
       Look at Holyfield.

24:04.710 --> 24:05.676
          He's ready.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.077
          He's got the
      opponent hurt again.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.180
  He's ready to put him away.

24:09.182 --> 24:11.615
      Even though there's
        no blood there.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.551
       Oh, there it goes.

24:13.553 --> 24:14.518
         You saw that.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.455
       It was inevitable.

24:17.457 --> 24:20.157
       Now wait a minute.

24:20.159 --> 24:23.961
GEORGE WILLIS: Evander launches
a lethal hook that drops Barry,

24:23.963 --> 24:25.262
   and everybody thinks, OK.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.063
         Fight's over.

24:26.065 --> 24:27.431
            Move on.

24:27.433 --> 24:32.236
  All of a sudden, the referee
starts motioning to the judges.

24:32.238 --> 24:35.706
      He starts motioning
     to Evander, and nobody

24:35.708 --> 24:37.541
 knows exactly what's going on.

24:37.543 --> 24:40.244
   ANNOUNCER: He is going to
 disqualify Evander Holyfield.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.950
       GEORGE WILLIS: He
     makes the announcement

24:45.952 --> 24:51.989
that Evander is disqualified for
 hitting after he called stop.

24:51.991 --> 24:55.125
      Nobody really heard
     the referee say stop.

24:55.127 --> 24:58.295
        All they saw was
     Evander drop the guy.

24:58.297 --> 25:00.331
     LOU DIBELLA: Holyfield
      got screwed royally.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.199
     He shouldn't have been
  disqualified against Barry.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.467
         It was a joke.

25:03.469 --> 25:06.904
    ANNOUNCER: Holyfield in
  total command of the fight.

25:06.906 --> 25:11.375
        And I just don't
    understand this ruling.

25:11.377 --> 25:13.344
   Look at Holyfield's face.

25:13.346 --> 25:16.313
 What an untoward development.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.819
       EVANDER HOLYFIELD:
        Very conscious.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.287
          Controlling.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.855
     Controlling the anger.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.524
    Controlling the tongue.

25:26.526 --> 25:28.192
    I sit there and took it.

25:28.194 --> 25:31.128
       Howard Cosell made
      me bigger than life.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.630
ANNOUNCER: This is unbelievable.

25:32.632 --> 25:35.132
       Holyfield holding
       himself together.

25:35.134 --> 25:38.035
     -A raging controversy
   had reared its ugly head.

25:38.037 --> 25:41.205
Bill Simon, the president of the
 Los Angeles Olympic Committee

25:41.207 --> 25:42.239
      has gotten involved.

25:42.241 --> 25:45.342
      It really is a full
       blown controversy.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.311
       GEORGE WILLIS: He
    wanted that gold medal,

25:47.313 --> 25:51.882
  but by responding to it the
  way he did, not complaining,

25:51.884 --> 25:55.319
        showing a lot of
       grace, he probably

25:55.321 --> 25:59.690
   emerged from that Olympics
     as the most well known

25:59.692 --> 26:01.525
      of all those boxers,
         even the ones

26:01.527 --> 26:04.495
  that had won the gold medal.

26:04.497 --> 26:07.531
 That became his launching pad
  was the Olympics, while Mike

26:07.533 --> 26:10.267
      had to begin his pro
      career in obscurity.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.239
      MIKE TYSON: Cus got
        me into thinking

26:15.241 --> 26:16.574
   about the great fighters.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.242
  And every time I failed, I'd
  go read about their failures

26:18.244 --> 26:21.579
     and how they overcame
        their failures.

26:21.581 --> 26:23.247
     -Mike had a very high
       skill set, and he

26:23.249 --> 26:27.117
  had a profound understanding
 of boxing and boxing history.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.786
        And that's what
       made him special.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.287
      MICKY WARD: When he
   wanted to know something,

26:30.289 --> 26:32.790
    he'd sit there and watch
    numerous fights of guys

26:32.792 --> 26:35.159
       from the '50s, and
        '40s, and '30s.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.995
He's like a boxing encyclopedia.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.129
       MIKE TYSON: What's
         the difference

26:39.131 --> 26:41.799
     between a good fighter
     and the great fighter?

26:41.801 --> 26:43.167
      It's how far they're
         willing to go

26:43.169 --> 26:46.170
      and how much they're
       willing to endure.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.438
 It's the hunger for the world.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.973
 You want to be that champion.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.374
      GEORGE WILLIS: Once
     you get to know Mike,

26:50.376 --> 26:53.310
you know he was a very insecure
 human being and very insecure

26:53.312 --> 26:57.881
fighter, so a lot of that tough
guy image and a lot of the talk

26:57.883 --> 27:03.253
and the brashness was basically
 to hide his own insecurities.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.589
CRAIG JONES: Every time he went
  in the ring, he was scared.

27:05.591 --> 27:08.325
     It wasn't like he just
     knew he was gonna win.

27:08.327 --> 27:11.061
  But Mike also knew, when he
 looked in that opponent's eye,

27:11.063 --> 27:12.429
        he'd seen fear.

27:12.431 --> 27:13.664
       MIKE TYSON: Scared
       as I was fighting,

27:13.666 --> 27:16.033
     I realized these guys
     were more afraid of me

27:16.035 --> 27:19.503
 than I was of them, and that's
   when my whole game started

27:19.505 --> 27:22.673
     changing as far as my
     approach to fighting.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.074
        ANNOUNCER: Left
       hand almost drove

27:24.076 --> 27:26.477
        Richardson right
      through the canvas.

27:26.479 --> 27:28.512
        -I'd get all his
      early fights on ESPN

27:28.514 --> 27:31.081
and he knocked everybody out in
 the first three second round.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.716
        So you looked at
        it and said wow.

27:32.718 --> 27:34.885
 -Anybody that wants to stay in
 the business for a long period

27:34.887 --> 27:36.787
    of time, like myself, I
   plan on staying in boxing.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.922
    I would like to box for
   at least a good 20 years,

27:38.924 --> 27:39.923
    because I love the game.

27:39.925 --> 27:40.758
       -You took care of
       business tonight.

27:40.760 --> 27:41.558
     Congratulations, Mike.

27:41.560 --> 27:42.726
     -Thank you, very much.

27:42.728 --> 27:45.262
        -I studied every
     fight that Mike fought

27:45.264 --> 27:46.597
 and told everybody, be quiet.

27:46.599 --> 27:48.298
         I'm watching.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.833
        Well, you know,
    because my whole thing,

27:49.835 --> 27:53.237
I realized that was going to be
 the toughest fight in my life

27:53.239 --> 27:55.039
        if it happened.

27:55.041 --> 27:58.308
      This is the guy that
   I've got to face one day.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.389
        BERNARD HOPKINS:
      In prison, you have

28:12.391 --> 28:14.558
        a lot of energy
       that's bottled up.

28:17.263 --> 28:20.030
   From one way or the other,
    love it, don't love it,

28:20.032 --> 28:24.134
     agree to disagree, it
      has to be released.

28:24.136 --> 28:28.539
After getting in a few fights, I
built a reputation on the block

28:28.541 --> 28:30.674
      like I was building
        on the streets.

28:30.676 --> 28:32.676
  I was known, don't fight me.

28:32.678 --> 28:36.647
     You've got to stab me.

28:36.649 --> 28:42.753
     At home, you can hide,
   but in those institutions,

28:42.755 --> 28:49.426
  you have to see these people
     every day you wake up.

28:49.428 --> 28:55.199
      Someone is plotting
    for that vulnerability.

28:55.201 --> 28:58.869
      You gotta meet your
        fears every day.

28:58.871 --> 29:00.904
    Things going through my
   head was that I'd be dead

29:00.906 --> 29:03.373
    before I hit 18, or I'd
   be in prison all my life,

29:03.375 --> 29:06.076
    or that I'd be nothing.

29:06.078 --> 29:09.747
    As I got more mature in
  jail and I started watching

29:09.749 --> 29:11.815
    other people, I started
       saying to myself,

29:11.817 --> 29:14.818
       what's wrong with
        this situation.

29:14.820 --> 29:17.221
 I had to stop being ignorant.

29:17.223 --> 29:19.823
   I started doing research.

29:19.825 --> 29:25.829
     I seen something to me
    that really woke me up.

29:25.831 --> 29:26.830
     Prison is a business.

29:34.473 --> 29:37.207
     It's 50, it's $60,000
     a year for one inmate.

29:44.216 --> 29:50.587
How can I keep myself from being
 an employee of this business?

29:50.589 --> 29:52.689
  JOHN PFAFF: Oftentimes, the
    real problem with prison

29:52.691 --> 29:54.558
  is this stultifying boredom.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.895
 There's mountains of evidence
that the supermax prisons where

29:57.897 --> 30:00.097
      you're in a cell by
    yourself 23 hours a day,

30:00.099 --> 30:01.732
         they literally
      drive people insane.

30:01.734 --> 30:03.734
      The people who leave
       are substantially

30:03.736 --> 30:05.435
        mentally harmed
       by the experience.

30:05.437 --> 30:09.039
    It's just not what we as
 humans are designed to handle.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.908
    I think that thing that
   gives you something to do,

30:10.910 --> 30:13.710
  to hold on to, can be a very
   powerful means of getting

30:13.712 --> 30:18.348
      yourself through the
      mind numbing tedium.

30:18.350 --> 30:21.018
    EVANDER HOLYFIELD: They
  had an old gym with a ring,

30:21.020 --> 30:26.757
  with gloves, with sparring,
 and Smokey Wilson, AKA Michael

30:26.759 --> 30:32.129
   Wilson, continued to say,
    come on to the gym, man.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.430
      Come on to the gym.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.732
   Stop fighting on the black
  or you gonna go in the hole,

30:35.734 --> 30:37.601
        or you gonna get
   stabbed, or this an that.

30:37.603 --> 30:38.402
      So, all right, man.

30:38.404 --> 30:39.203
        All right, yeah.

30:39.205 --> 30:40.537
      I'll go to the gym.

30:40.539 --> 30:44.007
   And I sparred with one of
   the known, respected guys.

30:50.449 --> 30:53.317
  I didn't knock him out, but
  I gave him a boxing lesson.

30:53.319 --> 30:56.486
       And Smokey Wilson
       became my trainer.

30:56.488 --> 31:01.592
   I got a chance to get back
  into what I've deviated from

31:01.594 --> 31:05.329
  and used it to my advantage
      in the penitentiary.

31:05.331 --> 31:09.566
It came to a thing where now, in
 prison, you bet on each other.

31:09.568 --> 31:12.936
And I'm getting this reputation
    because now, the block,

31:12.938 --> 31:15.639
     the jail was buzzing.

31:15.641 --> 31:21.645
     I became the celebrity
    boxer in a penitentiary.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.380
       The boxing program
        was established

31:23.382 --> 31:29.086
   in 38 penitentiaries, from
  Philadelphia to Pittsburgh.

31:29.088 --> 31:35.659
      And so we had boxing
      tournaments in jail.

31:35.661 --> 31:40.797
   In [inaudible], Rockview,
Dallas, Graterford, Smithville,

31:40.799 --> 31:42.566
          Frackville.

31:42.568 --> 31:46.937
     We, on buses, escorted
    by guard with shot guns

31:46.939 --> 31:50.641
  from one prison to another.

31:50.643 --> 31:53.810
     I'm beating everybody
     in every penitentiary,

31:53.812 --> 31:58.181
 and I become the middleweight
  State Penitentiary champion.

32:00.719 --> 32:02.786
      I fell back in love
       with boxing again.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.428
         MARK WAHLBERG:
      Boxing is the sport

32:11.430 --> 32:14.197
 which all others aspire to be.

32:14.199 --> 32:16.600
   It's you and another guy,
     and who wants it more,

32:16.602 --> 32:18.869
  and who's got the heart, and
   the will, and the desire,

32:18.871 --> 32:21.605
      but it comes down to
     a lot more than that.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.641
    GEORGE WILLIS: The best
   combat is man against man.

32:24.643 --> 32:27.644
      I mean, since Roman
     times, the gladiators.

32:27.646 --> 32:31.114
  It's human nature for people
 to compete against each other.

32:31.116 --> 32:34.051
 AL BERNSTEIN: Sometimes I feel
  so guilty I'm a boxing fan.

32:34.053 --> 32:37.054
      I know on one level,
        I'm not supposed

32:37.056 --> 32:39.256
     to really be enjoying
       what I'm watching.

32:39.258 --> 32:43.593
     And yet on another, I
     can't control myself.

32:43.595 --> 32:44.494
  LOU DIBELLA: We're violent.

32:44.496 --> 32:45.562
         We're animals.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.397
     Like any other animal,
       there's a release

32:47.399 --> 32:49.700
       of aggression that
      comes with fighting.

32:49.702 --> 32:50.834
     There's a drama to it.

32:50.836 --> 32:52.169
       Boxing is theater.

32:52.171 --> 32:54.604
  If it's not theater, you're
  fucking up in presenting it.

32:54.606 --> 32:57.107
      MARY J. BLIGE: To be
   ringside, you're like wow.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.575
        This is amazing.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.911
      The part for me that
       stuck was, people

33:00.913 --> 33:02.646
     are literally fighting
        for their lives.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.481
        They're fighting
      for their families.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.250
        That's the thing
       that attracted me.

33:07.252 --> 33:10.420
   -It's an ancient, brutal,
 some would say barbaric sport,

33:10.422 --> 33:12.622
     but there's something
        very interesting

33:12.624 --> 33:18.128
about the individuals who choose
to try to perform at that level

33:18.130 --> 33:21.098
       and risk what they
       risk in the ring.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.332
           -It's raw.

33:22.334 --> 33:25.469
  It's something that appeals
     to our basic instincts

33:25.471 --> 33:28.238
     of survival or battle.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.973
      Nobody else is going
       in there with you.

33:29.975 --> 33:31.308
    You can't call timeout.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.076
       -It's like having
      a fight with blood.

33:33.078 --> 33:34.945
     A fighter doesn't care
      who his opponent is.

33:34.947 --> 33:35.879
         He my weight?

33:35.881 --> 33:37.814
           Bring him.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.449
      LOU DIBELLA: It's a
      different mentality.

33:39.451 --> 33:41.985
   They're a different breed.

33:41.987 --> 33:44.488
    Fighters know what they
   have to sacrifice and give

33:44.490 --> 33:48.358
up to try to perfect their game.

33:48.360 --> 33:52.796
     A fighter learns from
   walking through the fire.

33:52.798 --> 33:55.098
   ANNOUNCER: Dwight Muhammad
   Qawi and Evander Holyfield

33:55.100 --> 33:58.468
      in their WBA Junior
    Heavyweight Title fight.

33:58.470 --> 33:59.803
       And of course, you
       remember Holyfield

33:59.805 --> 34:01.671
     with the controversial
          bronze medal

34:01.673 --> 34:03.473
      at the Olympic games
        in Los Angeles.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.842
         Since then, 11
     successful pro bouts.

34:05.844 --> 34:08.344
     Is 11 enough for going
       up against someone

34:08.347 --> 34:10.313
   of the experience of Qawi.

34:10.315 --> 34:11.313
             [ding]

34:11.315 --> 34:12.549
       The bell rings and
       this is round one.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.217
     ANNOUNCER: And one of
  Evander's biggest challenges

34:14.219 --> 34:16.887
 here is going to be overcoming
   the psychological barrier

34:16.889 --> 34:18.688
       of going 15 rounds
      for the first time.

34:24.963 --> 34:27.330
 LOU DIBELLA: Just keeping your
   hands up for three minutes

34:27.331 --> 34:31.668
 and moving around the ring is
tremendous exertion physically.

34:31.670 --> 34:36.540
   But running around for 15
 rounds, three minutes a round,

34:36.542 --> 34:39.376
throwing punches at a guy who's
trying to hurt you, and getting

34:39.378 --> 34:42.913
  hit while it's all going on,
 there's just nothing like it.

34:42.915 --> 34:43.713
        ANNOUNCER: Qawi.

34:43.715 --> 34:45.148
   Holyfield is going for it.

34:45.150 --> 34:48.518
 He doesn't wanna go 15 rounds.

34:48.520 --> 34:52.188
  He's only in round three and
   he's using so much energy.

34:52.190 --> 34:56.659
  Qawi breathing very heavily,
     but he is relentless.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.129
       A left and a right
       combination again.

34:59.131 --> 35:01.098
      Boy, that combo has
   worked well for Holyfield,

35:01.100 --> 35:04.101
    but now a big left right
  left coming back from Qawi.

35:04.103 --> 35:07.571
    Holyfield, back against
  the ropes and sliding away.

35:07.573 --> 35:12.042
    Qawi's slipping an awful
   lot of those punches out.

35:12.044 --> 35:14.511
       He missed about 10
      consecutive punches.

35:14.513 --> 35:17.481
   Qawi got underneath almost
   every punch from Holyfield

35:17.483 --> 35:19.916
    and came back and landed
      punches of his own.

35:19.918 --> 35:20.884
   You saw the smiling shrug.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.019
          And that is
    demoralizing to Evander.

35:23.021 --> 35:25.989
        He built up some
      energy for a flurry

35:25.991 --> 35:27.991
 and he got nothing out of it.

35:27.993 --> 35:29.960
         Just watching
      these two go at it,

35:29.962 --> 35:32.462
  there's no way that I could
   imagine this one going 15.

35:34.967 --> 35:37.000
       EVANDER HOLYFIELD:
    Whatever I hit him with,

35:37.002 --> 35:41.738
 that guy never stopped coming.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.073
         ANNOUNCER: Now
       we're really going

35:43.075 --> 35:46.309
   to get to see what kind of
 shape Evander Holyfield is in.

35:46.311 --> 35:48.879
    He's only been to eight
   rounds once in his career.

35:48.881 --> 35:51.882
   Evander Holyfield started
     this fight very fast.

35:51.884 --> 35:53.483
     Won the first round in
   convincing and impressive

35:53.485 --> 35:54.818
            fashion.

35:54.820 --> 35:57.053
   But the grabs have gotten
 closer and closer since then.

35:57.055 --> 36:01.825
Perspiration flying off the face
 of Holyfield as Qawi gets in.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.194
     And he looks a little
       slower and slower

36:04.196 --> 36:06.897
   as this fight moves along.

36:06.899 --> 36:10.100
    EVANDER HOLYFIELD: When
  somebody's breathing on you,

36:10.102 --> 36:13.503
 and they have the right to hit
 you just as the right you have

36:13.505 --> 36:16.306
    to hit them, they become
      the toughest thing.

36:16.308 --> 36:19.809
    ANNOUNCER: A right left,
 right left combo to Holyfield!

36:19.811 --> 36:20.944
    Holyfield is staggering!

36:20.946 --> 36:22.279
    ANNOUNCER: He's gotta be
    feeling hurt right now!

36:22.281 --> 36:24.014
       ANNOUNCER: This is
      just trench warfare.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.549
       Right now, Dwight
      Qawi is winning it.

36:25.551 --> 36:26.683
         ANNOUNCER: The
       question is, who's

36:26.685 --> 36:27.784
        gonna get their
       second wind first?

36:30.589 --> 36:33.623
     EVANDER HOLYFIELD: And
   just like somebody putting

36:33.625 --> 36:36.993
 a mask over your head and put
  your hands behind your back

36:36.995 --> 36:39.796
     and throw you out into
    the middle of the ocean,

36:39.798 --> 36:43.600
that's how tough this fight was.

36:43.602 --> 36:48.138
  ANNOUNCER: Round 11 Evander
Holyfield's never gone this far

36:48.140 --> 36:53.143
  in his professional career,
    or in his career period.

36:53.145 --> 36:56.646
     Goes for the head, and
     a big, powerful right,

36:56.648 --> 36:58.148
       the likes of which
        we haven't seen

36:58.150 --> 37:00.483
from Holyfield in a few rounds.

37:00.485 --> 37:02.419
  ANNOUNCER: I'm a little bit
surprised that Evander has been

37:02.421 --> 37:04.554
     able to hang in there
       as well as he did.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.523
     He tired a little bit,
       but he's come back

37:06.525 --> 37:08.024
and he's very much in the fight.

37:08.026 --> 37:10.026
       ANNOUNCER: Qawi's
      eyes are blood red.

37:10.028 --> 37:12.028
  He has taken numerous shots.

37:12.030 --> 37:14.030
      ANNOUNCER: Breathing
      very, very heavily.

37:14.032 --> 37:16.032
      Bloody in the mouth.

37:16.034 --> 37:18.001
Evander has a tremendous heart.

37:18.003 --> 37:21.004
   It's a burning intensity.

37:21.006 --> 37:23.006
    ANNOUNCER: As these two
   try to chip away and chip

37:23.008 --> 37:25.008
      away at the stamina
         of each other.

37:25.010 --> 37:26.710
  ANNOUNCER: Both men showing
      unbelievable courage

37:26.712 --> 37:27.510
       and determination.

37:31.016 --> 37:33.717
   EVANDER HOLYFIELD: I lost
    15 pounds in that fight.

37:33.719 --> 37:36.519
    They were talking about
   my kidneys were messed up.

37:36.521 --> 37:39.122
 All I wanted to do is not die.

37:39.124 --> 37:41.024
     ANNOUNCER: Holyfield's
      eyes have that fire.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.726
  ANNOUNCER: He is officially
    a professional fighter.

37:42.728 --> 37:46.596
He can go these 14, and he will
  be able to go the 15 rounds.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.832
   ANNOUNCER: Dwight Muhammad
   Qawi who yesterday called

37:48.834 --> 37:51.534
       Evander Holyfield
       mediocre would not

37:51.536 --> 37:53.937
be saying that to us right now.

37:53.939 --> 37:54.904
           [dinging]

37:54.906 --> 37:56.373
     ANNOUNCER: And there's
        the final bell!

37:59.778 --> 38:01.511
         -I didn't die.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.880
        I made it to the
      land, and then they

38:03.882 --> 38:06.616
       gave me a bonus by
      giving me the belt.

38:06.618 --> 38:09.819
 ANNOUNCER: For the winner and
new junior heavyweight champion

38:09.821 --> 38:12.055
of the world, Evander Holyfield!

38:17.529 --> 38:18.995
       EVANDER HOLYFIELD:
       After that, I was

38:18.997 --> 38:20.363
the light heavyweight champion.

38:20.365 --> 38:21.498
          But my goal.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.599
       I never forgot it.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.801
     My goal was to be the
      heavyweight champion

38:24.803 --> 38:26.369
         of the world.

38:26.371 --> 38:28.738
   -Evander Holyfield started
  as light heavyweight, which

38:28.740 --> 38:31.775
      is, you know, kinda
      like being the vice

38:31.777 --> 38:33.743
president of the United States.

38:33.745 --> 38:38.848
  It's-- It's not-- You don't
    get a lot of attention.

38:38.850 --> 38:43.053
      -When you talk about
    boxing, for most people,

38:43.055 --> 38:45.188
    you're talking about the
     heavyweight division.

38:45.190 --> 38:48.358
    The heavyweight champion
    of the world is an icon.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.727
     ANNOUNCER: This is the
      event of the night.

38:50.729 --> 38:54.698
      The WBC championship
         of the world.

38:54.700 --> 39:01.004
  In the blue corner, with 27
   wins, no defeats, 25 KOs,

39:01.006 --> 39:05.709
     he is the challenger,
          Mike Tyson!

39:05.711 --> 39:11.014
  And in the red corner, he is
  the WBC heavyweight champion

39:11.016 --> 39:14.250
 of the world, Trevor Berbick.

39:17.255 --> 39:20.223
 MILLS LANE: Any questions from
the challenger or chief second?

39:20.225 --> 39:21.358
        -No, we're cool.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.226
       -Any question the
   champion or chief second?

39:23.228 --> 39:24.394
  All right, let's get it on!

39:24.396 --> 39:25.695
            Come on.
     ANNOUNCER: All right.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.197
      And with the word of
    Mills Lane, we're ready.

39:27.199 --> 39:29.366
 I don't know about you folks,
 but here at the Hilton Hotel,

39:29.368 --> 39:31.167
      there is electricity
         in the crowd.

39:31.169 --> 39:34.170
     Mike Tyson has trained
    his whole life for this.

39:34.172 --> 39:37.173
And let's watch how quick Tyson
  will jump on Trevor Berbick.

39:37.175 --> 39:39.142
        You get the idea
        now that Berbick

39:39.144 --> 39:41.644
      is showing a little
         bravado here.

39:41.646 --> 39:44.147
      And Tyson clubs him
      with the left hand.

39:44.149 --> 39:45.115
         Look at this!

39:45.117 --> 39:46.316
          Combination!

39:46.318 --> 39:48.618
    And Berbick ready to go,
   but he stays on his feet.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.120
 Another right hand clips him.

39:50.122 --> 39:52.589
      He can't take shots
      like this very long.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.591
    And he gets [inaudible],
         and he's done!

39:54.593 --> 39:56.593
       As he stands right
        up, the count's

39:56.595 --> 39:59.062
       to four, and five,
      and six, and seven,

39:59.064 --> 40:00.764
and eight, and he says he's OK.

40:00.766 --> 40:01.865
          -All right?

40:01.867 --> 40:04.067
     ANNOUNCER: Mills Lane
      let's them continue.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.535
     In comes Tyson again.

40:05.537 --> 40:07.036
        He knows he can
       hurt him any time.

40:07.038 --> 40:09.038
    Catches him with a right
  left hook, and he goes down!

40:09.040 --> 40:10.073
         He goes down!

40:10.075 --> 40:12.008
       He should be able
      to get up from this.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.209
      His legs maybe shot.

40:13.211 --> 40:14.277
           They are!

40:14.279 --> 40:16.513
    As Trevor Berbick falls
       back in the ropes,

40:16.515 --> 40:18.481
      I don't know if he's
   gonna be able to continue!

40:18.483 --> 40:20.750
      He's got the heart,
       but his body won't

40:20.752 --> 40:22.986
        let him do what
       his mind wants to.

40:22.988 --> 40:24.954
     And he's counted out.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.456
         It's all over.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.658
     We've got a brand new
      heavyweight champion

40:28.660 --> 40:29.459
         of the world.

40:29.461 --> 40:30.460
          Mike Tyson!

40:34.433 --> 40:38.034
 MIKE TYSON: That was the most
  exciting moment of my life.

40:38.036 --> 40:40.503
 People patting me on the back
 and saying, wow, you're great.

40:40.505 --> 40:41.938
      I never saw anybody
        like you before.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.840
       It was incredible.

40:43.842 --> 40:47.177
How am I gonna articulate this?

40:47.179 --> 40:50.013
     All I did about being
    the champion and stuff,

40:50.015 --> 40:51.614
     this is very serious,
        since I was 13.

40:51.616 --> 40:53.483
      This isn't be like,
        hey, we're gonna

40:53.485 --> 40:54.717
box and get some trophies, guys.

40:54.719 --> 40:56.019
              No.

40:56.021 --> 40:57.921
   Our purpose is to win and
  win in spectacular fashion.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.924
[MUSIC PUBLIC ENEMY, "WELCOME TO
        THE TERRORDOME"]

41:08.934 --> 41:10.366
      CURTIS JACKSON: Mike
     did something special.

41:10.368 --> 41:13.736
  He convinced me that no man
 on the planet could beat him.

41:13.738 --> 41:15.071
      You could get up and
      go to the bathroom,

41:15.073 --> 41:16.840
         come back, the
      fucking fight over.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.508
    NAAZIM RICHARDSON: Mike
   got a bad rep in the sense

41:18.510 --> 41:21.678
    that people concentrated
        on intimidation.

41:21.680 --> 41:22.879
      The only way you're
         intimidated is

41:22.881 --> 41:25.248
        because you seen
       him do something.

41:25.250 --> 41:27.784
     When you see somebody
   knock out 22 other people,

41:27.786 --> 41:30.687
     yeah, the 23rd guy may
    be a little intimidated.

41:30.689 --> 41:33.590
      LOU DIBELLA: He was
  unstoppable force of nature.

41:33.592 --> 41:36.326
   I mean, I still in my head
    have visions of Welcome

41:36.328 --> 41:38.795
    to the Terrordome being
 played where Tyson was walking

41:38.797 --> 41:41.431
    into the ring twitching
       with no socks on,

41:41.433 --> 41:43.399
      and the guy standing
       in the ring looked

41:43.401 --> 41:44.501
like he was shitting his pants.

41:47.038 --> 41:49.372
   -Don King told him, every
  time that you knock somebody

41:49.374 --> 41:52.242
   out in the first round, I
   give you $100,000 in cash.

41:52.244 --> 41:54.210
ANNOUNCER: And he's down again.

41:54.212 --> 41:56.179
      ANNOUNCER: He's not
       going to make it.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.548
         It's all over.

41:58.550 --> 42:01.484
 MARK WAHLBERG: First big fight
  I went to was a Tyson fight,

42:01.486 --> 42:03.253
     and there was nothing
    more exciting than that.

42:03.255 --> 42:05.655
       -He put on a show.

42:05.657 --> 42:08.525
 When the lights came on, Mike
 just knew, this is my moment.

42:08.527 --> 42:10.760
      Everybody's watching
         me right now.

42:10.762 --> 42:11.661
    -It was crazy in there.

42:11.663 --> 42:12.529
       Just great energy.

42:12.531 --> 42:13.930
      Unbelievable energy.

42:13.932 --> 42:15.431
CRAIG JONES: Every time we'd get
home, Mike said, well who came?

42:15.433 --> 42:16.566
    How did they look like?

42:16.568 --> 42:19.469
    He just wanted to know,
    what was the crowd like.

42:19.471 --> 42:21.104
        And it's hard to
       explain it to him.

42:21.106 --> 42:23.439
     You see Eddie Murphy,
     you see Donald Trump.

42:23.441 --> 42:26.209
      You see so many big
    people in the audience.

42:26.211 --> 42:28.945
    Like, if you was in that
   front three or four rows,

42:28.947 --> 42:30.346
       you were somebody.

42:30.348 --> 42:32.549
     -Tyson was superhuman.

42:32.551 --> 42:35.318
  He represented our culture.

42:35.320 --> 42:36.586
  He represented who we were.

42:36.588 --> 42:37.820
    Mike Tyson was a phenom.

42:37.822 --> 42:39.289
   Everybody heard about him.

42:39.291 --> 42:42.659
 -Mike Tyson represents in the
 community the American dream,

42:42.661 --> 42:46.162
  that anybody can make it if
  they have the determination.

42:46.164 --> 42:47.397
      MIKE TYSON: Cus put
       me in the mindset

42:47.399 --> 42:48.898
        that there's no
      room for everybody.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.466
  I need to suck all the air.

42:50.468 --> 42:52.001
   I need to reign with gods.

42:52.003 --> 42:54.037
     REPORTER: Do you ever
   stop to think about money?

42:54.039 --> 42:55.538
     MIKE TYSON: The stage
    of thinking about money

42:55.540 --> 42:56.639
          is far gone.

42:56.641 --> 42:58.608
     I don't have to worry
      about that no more.

42:58.610 --> 42:59.842
      I'm just having fun.

42:59.844 --> 43:03.746
    -They were able to sell
  Mike Tyson very effectively.

43:03.748 --> 43:06.783
He delivered, of course, because
he scored all these knock outs,

43:06.785 --> 43:09.586
        and you got this
     feeling of caged fury.

43:09.588 --> 43:13.656
 -In our era, what would boxing
 have been without Mike Tyson?

43:13.658 --> 43:15.158
   Could you say it would've
      been this exciting?

43:18.163 --> 43:21.664
       After Ali, people
     stopped liking boxing.

43:21.666 --> 43:26.135
   It don't bother me to say
 that I was in the right time,

43:26.137 --> 43:27.403
          with Tyson.

43:27.405 --> 43:32.308
   That's when the fire came
  back in the game of boxing.

43:32.310 --> 43:35.011
     BERNARD HOPKINS: When
    Tyson came in the game,

43:35.013 --> 43:39.248
       boxing became one
      of the most popular,

43:39.250 --> 43:43.486
    if not the popular sport
outside the walls of Graterford.

43:43.488 --> 43:45.154
We used to watch fights on ABC.

43:45.156 --> 43:48.091
We used to watch fights on ESPN.

43:48.093 --> 43:51.728
    Alexis Arguello and the
     fighters that was hot.

43:51.730 --> 43:53.896
       And I'm like, yo.

43:53.898 --> 43:54.998
     I can beat these guys.

44:01.606 --> 44:10.413
 For myself to come out and be
  paroled to a halfway house,

44:10.415 --> 44:15.184
      I said to myself, I
    gotta make boxing work.

44:15.186 --> 44:19.722
  I knew that this is the only
  thing that I had to gamble.

44:24.562 --> 44:27.597
    -Most guys go back when
   you're in that situation.

44:27.599 --> 44:29.465
     When they lock you up
      when you're like 17,

44:29.467 --> 44:31.567
      and you get out when
      you're like 23, 24,

44:31.569 --> 44:34.303
       now you're thrown
      into the adult world

44:34.305 --> 44:37.774
  with no job skills, nothing
   but a record on your back.

44:37.776 --> 44:40.410
      Plus, little guy you
      seen on your block,

44:40.412 --> 44:43.846
  he comes past you in a brand
   new car with a gold chain

44:43.848 --> 44:45.915
     big enough for you to
    see your reflection in.

44:45.917 --> 44:47.517
   That's hard to deal with.

44:47.519 --> 44:50.219
 -When you go away, if you come
back into the same environment,

44:50.221 --> 44:52.855
 around the same circumstances,
     around the same people

44:52.857 --> 44:55.058
    that you're comfortable
 making these decisions around,

44:55.060 --> 44:58.628
  and you have influences that
 make things easy for you to be

44:58.630 --> 45:02.832
      in a bad situation,
      temptation is great.

45:02.834 --> 45:06.102
 It's the same if you're trying
 not to be involved with drugs.

45:06.104 --> 45:07.637
       REPORTER: Because
       of its low price,

45:07.639 --> 45:11.307
  crack permeates the country,
  especially the inner cities.

45:11.309 --> 45:14.844
   -When the crack came into
    and flooded the streets,

45:14.846 --> 45:18.014
  it was just hard to say no.

45:18.016 --> 45:20.216
         The crack era
      affected everybody.

45:20.218 --> 45:23.186
      If you lived in that
    area where they sold it,

45:23.188 --> 45:25.321
 you were going to be involved.

45:25.323 --> 45:26.656
       -You're looking at
        your environment

45:26.658 --> 45:27.724
   and no one's helping you.

45:27.726 --> 45:29.025
    No one's doing anything.

45:29.027 --> 45:30.993
  Just feeding you the drugs,
    feeding you the alcohol,

45:30.995 --> 45:32.762
        feeding you the
       negative comments.

45:32.764 --> 45:35.465
   They're doing exactly what
  was done to you as a child,

45:35.467 --> 45:37.700
    so you have to shift and
    change your environment.

45:37.702 --> 45:38.501
         Do something.

45:38.503 --> 45:40.136
       Change something.

45:40.138 --> 45:41.871
     NAAZIM RICHARDSON: For
 Bernard to not violate parole

45:41.873 --> 45:44.907
  during that era, during that
 time, was the most impressive

45:44.909 --> 45:46.309
             to me.

45:46.311 --> 45:50.046
He dealt with it, he came home,
  he was able to move forward.

45:50.048 --> 45:52.081
     He realized it wasn't
       the life for him.

45:52.083 --> 45:54.150
   He was gonna make sure it
    wouldn't happen to him.

45:54.152 --> 45:58.321
  -How can I beat the system?

45:58.323 --> 45:59.122
           I fought.

45:59.124 --> 46:00.423
           I worked.

46:00.425 --> 46:01.457
     I worked in a kitchen.

46:01.459 --> 46:03.726
    I worked on landscaping.

46:03.728 --> 46:04.594
         I did roofing.

46:04.596 --> 46:07.296
    I found some new people.

46:07.298 --> 46:09.532
        Those new people
       got me into boxing

46:09.534 --> 46:12.401
as far as on the business side.

46:12.403 --> 46:14.904
     I was the only fighter
        to my knowledge

46:14.906 --> 46:20.209
   to take a team of trainers
     and go to Graterford,

46:20.211 --> 46:26.682
     and train and use that
    environment to remind me

46:26.684 --> 46:29.585
       where I came from.

46:29.587 --> 46:31.788
    AL BERNSTEIN: I think it
  speaks volumes about Bernard

46:31.790 --> 46:36.793
    and how he looks at life
  that he went back to prison

46:36.795 --> 46:40.630
    with his team, looked at
    the situation, and know,

46:40.632 --> 46:44.367
     this is what I do not
    want to fall back into.

46:44.369 --> 46:45.668
      -There were athletes
         who came along

46:45.670 --> 46:47.637
         who had better
      talent than Bernard.

46:47.639 --> 46:48.771
      There were athletes
         who came along

46:48.773 --> 46:51.674
   who had better positions,
       better situations.

46:51.676 --> 46:55.411
         His discipline
       has set him apart.

46:55.413 --> 46:56.846
       ANNOUNCER: And the
      new IBF middleweight

46:56.848 --> 47:00.516
     champion of the world,
        Barnard Hopkins!

47:05.456 --> 47:08.691
     BERNARD HOPKINS: I won
    my first title in 1994.

47:08.693 --> 47:12.795
From there, I went on to defend
 the middleweight championship

47:12.797 --> 47:14.797
         for 11 years.

47:14.799 --> 47:17.733
      ANNOUNCER: Oscar de
     la Hoya is knocked out

47:17.735 --> 47:22.171
     by a left hook to the
   liver by Bernard Hopkins.

47:25.076 --> 47:26.209
       NAAZIM RICHARDSON:
        Bernard Hopkins

47:26.211 --> 47:28.177
is our Ray Robinson of this era.

47:28.179 --> 47:30.646
      Those guys were cut
    from a different cloth.

47:30.648 --> 47:31.881
  The ones who could sustain.

47:31.883 --> 47:35.251
     ANNOUNCER: Tonight you
    have witnessed history.

47:35.253 --> 47:36.953
   Boxing's ageless warrior.

47:36.955 --> 47:38.354
        Bernard Hopkins!

47:43.428 --> 47:47.930
-He became the oldest fighter to
win a world title, at an age 48

47:47.932 --> 47:52.134
 when it's almost impossible to
 imagine a fighter doing this.

47:52.136 --> 47:53.536
       NAAZIM RICHARDSON:
    Bernard walked and kept

47:53.538 --> 47:56.672
    that middleweight weight
     for 20 title defenses.

47:56.674 --> 47:58.908
       20 title defenses.

47:58.910 --> 48:00.843
       That's gonna be a
     hard record to break.

48:00.845 --> 48:03.145
 -He's just always represented
    a hungry fighter that's

48:03.147 --> 48:06.215
       dedicated and put
       in a lot of work.

48:06.217 --> 48:10.019
  You can just tell he didn't
  get anything handed to him.

48:10.021 --> 48:12.455
    -Bernard Hopkins, to me,
   is a testament to the fact

48:12.457 --> 48:16.792
        that anyone can
    reshape their thinking,

48:16.794 --> 48:19.929
       can reshape their
       life, and continue

48:19.931 --> 48:22.064
  to live that reshaped life.

48:22.066 --> 48:25.501
    The Bernard Hopkins that
   I've known all these years

48:25.503 --> 48:28.337
        and the man who
      resurrected his life

48:28.339 --> 48:32.541
     is an absolute pillar
      of self discipline.

48:32.543 --> 48:36.746
   -What saved me was knowing
 that I can do this, and to be

48:36.748 --> 48:38.114
        able to do this
       in a penitentiary.

48:40.685 --> 48:43.486
        Those stages are
       critical, for me.

48:43.488 --> 48:45.254
       To be able to come
        through that era

48:45.256 --> 48:49.158
     and come through that
      time with the scars,

48:49.160 --> 48:53.529
   but I used it to motivate
     me in a different way.

48:53.531 --> 48:56.899
   It took time to get there.

48:56.901 --> 48:58.701
    -Bernard Hopkins is very
      lucky to have boxing

48:58.703 --> 48:59.835
    and to capitalize on it.

48:59.837 --> 49:01.871
     He had it, and then he
     took advantage of it.

49:01.873 --> 49:05.408
  People who don't have those
  options, it gets very bleak.

49:05.410 --> 49:07.109
   We've cut back on a lot of
    the educational options,

49:07.111 --> 49:08.611
      we've cut back on a
     lot of the facilities,

49:08.613 --> 49:10.446
       we've cut back on
     time out in the yard.

49:10.448 --> 49:12.915
    We've cut back on spots.

49:12.917 --> 49:14.383
        BERNARD HOPKINS:
       Energized inmates

49:14.385 --> 49:16.819
      use their energy in
      the right direction

49:16.821 --> 49:18.654
 by going to the boxing circle.

49:18.656 --> 49:24.160
       It releases energy
     that won't be released

49:24.162 --> 49:28.464
        on authority or
       on other inmates.

49:28.466 --> 49:31.067
        -Those kinds of
     programs are no longer

49:31.069 --> 49:33.569
 available in today's prisons.

49:33.571 --> 49:36.339
      Today's prisons are
     more about punishment

49:36.341 --> 49:40.076
  rather than recognizing the
 mistakes individuals may have

49:40.078 --> 49:44.313
        made and helping
      them grow from them.

49:44.315 --> 49:46.782
    JOHN PFAFF: Sometimes we
  completely perverse things.

49:46.784 --> 49:48.985
  In New York state, at least,
the single most popular training

49:48.987 --> 49:50.886
       program in prison
       is barber school.

49:50.888 --> 49:52.121
     So you have thousands
        of men training

49:52.123 --> 49:54.156
    to be barbers in prison.

49:54.158 --> 49:56.792
It's actually giving them a job
 to do while they're in prison,

49:56.794 --> 49:58.194
       providing actually
         a useful skill

49:58.196 --> 49:59.595
        they can use on
       the outside, only

49:59.597 --> 50:00.830
      they're not allowed
       to use it at all.

50:00.832 --> 50:03.332
       People on parole,
  ex-felons, can't be barbers.

50:03.334 --> 50:04.867
   Blanket ban for licensing.

50:04.869 --> 50:07.003
 Once you get into that system,
 we're actually setting you up

50:07.005 --> 50:09.171
even more to fail down the line.

50:09.173 --> 50:11.107
     They just keep making
    it tougher and tougher,

50:11.109 --> 50:13.442
and then shaking their heads in
 disappointment when they fail,

50:13.444 --> 50:16.145
  and making it tougher still.

50:16.147 --> 50:18.681
    DAVID LEONARD: Activist
 Angela Davis describes prisons

50:18.683 --> 50:21.417
      as this place where
     we don't make problems

50:21.419 --> 50:23.819
       disappear, we make
       people disappear.

50:23.821 --> 50:27.957
 We want to think of ourselves
   as never making mistakes,

50:27.959 --> 50:31.394
  and so when confronted with
 individuals who make mistakes,

50:31.396 --> 50:32.695
        we're forced to
      look in the mirror.

50:40.071 --> 50:41.871
     LOU DIBELLA: Muhammad
        Ali in his prime

50:41.873 --> 50:44.106
  was served by his character.

50:44.108 --> 50:46.442
       Mike Tyson didn't
      have that character.

50:46.444 --> 50:49.345
  He had tremendous ferocity,
 tremendous ability, god given

50:49.347 --> 50:51.113
       strength, but the
       people around him

50:51.115 --> 50:53.616
    weren't encouraging him
     to develop character.

50:53.618 --> 50:57.553
  They were enabling him, in a
lot of ways, to destroy himself.

50:57.555 --> 50:59.255
       GEORGE WILLIS: His
       only real mentors

50:59.257 --> 51:02.124
       were his managers
       and his trainers.

51:02.126 --> 51:04.460
      They weren't really
      trying to teach him

51:04.462 --> 51:08.931
  a lot of social skills other
  than how to deal with media.

51:08.933 --> 51:12.268
 LARRY SLOMAN: People treat you
differently when you're famous.

51:12.270 --> 51:15.805
   Fame really distorts your
  own perception of yourself.

51:15.807 --> 51:17.239
          -Just think.

51:17.241 --> 51:19.108
        Anybody in this
     planet with 6 billion

51:19.110 --> 51:22.144
   people-- 6 billion right?

51:22.146 --> 51:23.979
        Anybody in this
       planet, you could

51:23.981 --> 51:26.649
   beat them in a fair fight.

51:26.651 --> 51:30.252
        You tell me how
     that'd feed your ego.

51:30.254 --> 51:31.387
        LARRY SLOMAN: He
       starts buying all

51:31.389 --> 51:32.888
 these incredible sports cars.

51:32.890 --> 51:35.958
      He buys Bentleys, he
       buys Rolls Royces,

51:35.960 --> 51:38.427
      and he starts buying
        these mansions,

51:38.429 --> 51:40.629
      and of course, it's
    conspicuous consumption.

51:40.631 --> 51:44.533
    He's showing the world,
    look how far he's come.

51:44.535 --> 51:47.436
    MIKE TYSON: My life only
existed through accomplishments.

51:47.438 --> 51:49.371
You win this, you get this car.

51:49.373 --> 51:50.639
  You when this, you get this.

51:50.641 --> 51:52.575
  You win this, you get that.

51:52.577 --> 51:54.243
    BERNARD HOPKINS: And you
     have that much money,

51:54.245 --> 51:56.846
     everything's possible.

51:56.848 --> 51:58.414
      SPIKE LEE: The media
    was creating this image,

51:58.416 --> 52:00.950
      but Mike was helping
      them with the image

52:00.952 --> 52:03.018
       that he was just a
      savage, a wild man.

52:03.020 --> 52:04.954
  MIKE TYSON: I'll fuck you in
 your ass, you punk white boy.

52:04.956 --> 52:08.757
     I'll eat your asshole
       alive, you bitch.

52:08.759 --> 52:09.558
    I became a megalomaniac.

52:09.560 --> 52:12.094
     I thought I was a god.

52:12.096 --> 52:14.063
  If you were old enough, you
may have seen some of my fights

52:14.065 --> 52:15.731
     and some of the things
        I said to people

52:15.733 --> 52:19.668
  or said about myself as some
 kind of demigod or something.

52:19.670 --> 52:20.769
   I'm a tyrannosaurus, man.

52:20.771 --> 52:22.371
    I'm a tyrannical titan.

52:22.373 --> 52:23.739
       I'm the best ever.

52:23.741 --> 52:25.074
       There's never been
      anybody as ruthless.

52:25.076 --> 52:26.475
        That's just the
       way I was trained

52:26.477 --> 52:29.945
     to fight to have that
     kind of belief system.

52:29.947 --> 52:32.481
 -We all heard those stories of
  people that have had nothing

52:32.483 --> 52:34.817
    and then had it all and
 didn't know how to handle it.

52:34.819 --> 52:37.119
  It's one thing to be able to
have that drive and that desire

52:37.121 --> 52:39.555
     to become a champion,
       but to stay hungry

52:39.557 --> 52:45.327
  when you have that success,
  it becomes that much harder.

52:45.329 --> 52:48.330
 AL BERNSTEIN: We think of him
as this monster with huge power.

52:48.332 --> 52:53.769
And he did have power, but Mike
 Tyson was a small heavyweight

52:53.771 --> 52:58.741
      who needed to fight
     well to be effective.

52:58.743 --> 53:01.377
    A Mike Tyson that isn't
     perfectly conditioned,

53:01.379 --> 53:04.780
  and a Mike Tyson that isn't
   fighting the right style,

53:04.782 --> 53:06.815
         he's beatable.

53:06.817 --> 53:08.884
       ANNOUNCER: Please
    welcome the challenger,

53:08.886 --> 53:09.818
     James Buster Douglas!

53:15.626 --> 53:17.826
        AL BERNSTEIN: No
       one expected Mike

53:17.828 --> 53:20.162
Tyson to lose to Buster Douglas.

53:20.164 --> 53:21.830
  The odds were astronomical.

53:21.832 --> 53:26.068
     ANNOUNCER: Introducing
   the undefeated, undisputed

53:26.070 --> 53:28.470
      heavyweight champion
         of the world.

53:28.472 --> 53:33.008
        The one and only
        iron Mike Tyson!

53:36.113 --> 53:38.847
 AL BERNSTEIN: It was in Japan,
  and most news organizations

53:38.849 --> 53:41.250
    didn't even send anybody
      to cover the fight.

53:41.252 --> 53:42.051
            -Larry.

53:42.053 --> 53:43.419
   What are we about to see?

53:43.421 --> 53:48.023
 Another 90 second annihilation
  of an ill prepared opponent?

53:48.025 --> 53:50.459
    -Well, in the important
     game of expectations,

53:50.461 --> 53:54.263
  this fight is over before it
   begins or soon thereafter.

53:54.265 --> 53:57.266
      You have to remember
   that just nobody believes

53:57.268 --> 54:00.069
      anybody can compete
        with Mike Tyson.

54:00.071 --> 54:02.905
    ANNOUNCER: And there, of
  course, is Evander Holyfield

54:02.907 --> 54:05.507
      who has a guarantee
         of $12 million

54:05.509 --> 54:08.010
  to fight Mike Tyson in June.

54:08.012 --> 54:09.411
     AL BERNSTEIN: Everyone
      was looking forward

54:09.413 --> 54:11.714
     to Mike Tyson fighting
       Evander Holyfield.

54:11.716 --> 54:14.116
         I watched the
      Douglas Tyson fight

54:14.118 --> 54:16.085
       with Donald Trump
      and his executives.

54:16.087 --> 54:18.687
      They were expecting
      that Tyson Holyfield

54:18.689 --> 54:20.589
       fight to be on one
      of their properties

54:20.591 --> 54:22.791
      and would be a major
        event for them.

54:22.793 --> 54:25.794
    LARRY SLOMAN: Mike went
kicking and screaming to Tokyo.

54:25.796 --> 54:29.398
 He thought, I knocked out guys
  that beat Buster Douglas, so

54:29.400 --> 54:32.201
     why do I have to train
      for Buster Douglas.

54:32.203 --> 54:35.638
      So he got there and
        he didn't train.

54:35.640 --> 54:42.077
 And he instead enjoyed all the
 fruits of young Japanese women

54:42.079 --> 54:43.178
             there.

54:43.180 --> 54:45.681
     GEORGE WILLIS: Buster
      had nothing to lose,

54:45.683 --> 54:48.017
      and he was training
         his heart out.

54:48.019 --> 54:50.686
        Evander saw this
      and he knew trouble

54:50.688 --> 54:51.954
    might be on the horizon.

54:51.956 --> 54:54.390
 ANNOUNCER: Douglas is getting
    Mike Tyson to reach in.

54:54.392 --> 54:55.891
       When you reach in,
      that's what happens.

54:55.893 --> 54:58.127
    ANNOUNCER: That's a good
  right hand, and a good right

54:58.129 --> 55:01.363
     uppercut, and two more
    good rights by Douglas.

55:01.365 --> 55:04.833
    I don't think I've ever
  seen Tyson absorb that kind

55:04.835 --> 55:07.303
       of a four or five
       punch combination

55:07.305 --> 55:09.505
         before in his
      professional career.

55:09.507 --> 55:11.974
       And he has swelled
      up Mike Tyson's eye

55:11.976 --> 55:15.911
       and is dominating
      the fight right now.

55:15.913 --> 55:18.080
     AL BERNSTEIN: It was a
    perfect storm of events.

55:18.082 --> 55:21.483
  It was Mike Tyson not taking
  Buster Douglas as seriously

55:21.485 --> 55:23.352
       as he should have,
       and it was Buster

55:23.354 --> 55:25.454
       Douglas preparing
       himself correctly.

55:25.456 --> 55:26.655
      ANNOUNCER: Brawling
         willingly just

55:26.657 --> 55:28.924
   to try to get in the shot
    that will finish things.

55:28.926 --> 55:30.426
  ANNOUNCER: Oh, the uppercut!

55:30.428 --> 55:32.895
 ANNOUNCER: What an uppercut by
 Douglas, and down goes Tyson!

55:40.271 --> 55:43.238
        Down goes Tyson.

55:43.240 --> 55:52.614
    -Two, three, four, five,
    six, seven, eight, nine!

55:52.616 --> 55:54.083
       ANNOUNCER: He's--
     Well, it-- It's over!

55:54.085 --> 55:55.217
     ANNOUNCER: It's over!

55:55.219 --> 55:56.719
     ANNOUNCER: Mike Tyson
     has been knocked out!

55:56.721 --> 55:57.519
         Unbelievable!

56:02.693 --> 56:03.992
       LOU DIBELLA: There
      are a lot of lessons

56:03.994 --> 56:06.462
  fighters learn the hard way.

56:06.464 --> 56:08.263
      Every fighter comes
        to know the fact

56:08.265 --> 56:11.867
        that this is an
       unforgiving sport.

56:11.869 --> 56:13.836
         ANNOUNCER: And
      suddenly, Mike Tyson

56:13.838 --> 56:17.506
   has been reduced to being
  another heavyweight champion

56:17.508 --> 56:21.243
       who got defeated.

56:21.245 --> 56:22.611
      LOU DIBELLA: There's
      no other sport where

56:22.613 --> 56:24.780
        you can rise and
        fall so quickly.

56:28.853 --> 56:30.753
   EVANDER HOLYFIELD: When I
became the heavyweight champion

56:30.755 --> 56:35.090
   of the world for the first
   time with Buster Douglas,

56:35.092 --> 56:37.760
     people hated the fact.

56:37.762 --> 56:39.728
     ANNOUNCER: [inaudible]
       Holyfield-- right

56:39.730 --> 56:41.196
      hand stuns Douglas!

56:41.198 --> 56:42.631
ANNOUNCER: Caught him going in!

56:42.633 --> 56:45.067
   He is not going to get up.

56:45.069 --> 56:48.003
   There goes the heavyweight
   championship of the world!

56:48.005 --> 56:50.606
  ANNOUNCER: Evander Holyfield
 with a third round knock out!

56:50.608 --> 56:52.808
 EVANDER HOLYFIELD: They said,
 you can't get no credibility.

56:52.810 --> 56:55.511
Man, you still ain't the champ.

56:55.513 --> 56:58.147
     You ain't beat Tyson.

56:58.149 --> 56:59.882
      REPORTER: An Indiana
    grand jury has indicted

56:59.884 --> 57:02.418
       former heavyweight
    boxing champ Mike Tyson.

57:02.420 --> 57:04.520
       He is charged with
       raping a woman who

57:04.522 --> 57:05.954
        was a contestant
        in this summer's

57:05.956 --> 57:07.689
  Miss Black America pageant.

57:07.691 --> 57:09.024
      REPORTER: Within the
      past hour, the jury

57:09.026 --> 57:10.492
 has returned for indictments.

57:10.494 --> 57:13.796
   One for rape, two charges
  of criminal deviant conduct,

57:13.798 --> 57:15.030
 and one charge of confinement.

57:21.839 --> 57:26.041
-If I was in here for something
that I did, it would be easier,

57:26.043 --> 57:29.445
 but just the fact that I'm in
 here for something I didn't do

57:29.447 --> 57:31.747
       and I'm innocent,
     every day I'm walking

57:31.749 --> 57:33.081
   a thin line through hell.

57:33.083 --> 57:35.284
      I thought prison was
     for the rehabilitation

57:35.286 --> 57:37.486
 of men or women, so to speak.

57:37.488 --> 57:38.454
 That's what I always thought.

57:38.456 --> 57:39.421
  That's what they always say.

57:39.423 --> 57:40.656
        We send you here
      and we rehabilitate

57:40.658 --> 57:42.357
 you so you won't do it again.

57:42.359 --> 57:45.627
People come out of prison, they
  come out in worse condition

57:45.629 --> 57:47.596
       than they was when
      they first entered.

57:47.598 --> 57:49.631
  ANNOUNCER: In the lackluster
   heavyweight division, even

57:49.633 --> 57:53.068
       without his crown,
    Tyson is still the man.

57:53.070 --> 57:55.370
     Promoters even courted
       him at the prison,

57:55.372 --> 57:58.207
  hoping to share an estimated
      $100 million payday.

58:02.379 --> 58:03.879
       EVANDER HOLYFIELD:
   Waiting for my opportunity

58:03.881 --> 58:06.482
 to get a chance to fight him,
   there's a lot of writers,

58:06.484 --> 58:09.518
     in general, that think
  that really he's the champ.

58:09.520 --> 58:11.920
 But realistic, I am the champ.

58:11.922 --> 58:12.754
        I have the belt.

58:16.093 --> 58:18.427
     REPORTER: Long before
     dawn, news helicopters

58:18.429 --> 58:21.430
 hovered over the state prison,
    and cameras were ready.

58:21.432 --> 58:23.832
     Hundreds of them from
       around the world.

58:23.834 --> 58:25.534
         Tyson issued a
       written statement.

58:25.536 --> 58:28.170
      I'm very happy to be
    out and on my way home.

58:28.172 --> 58:29.805
 I will have more to say later.

58:34.445 --> 58:36.645
     GEORGE WILLIS: It was
  viewed as good versus evil.

58:36.647 --> 58:37.980
     The good was Evander.

58:37.982 --> 58:41.350
   The good Christian guy who
talks about the lord and things

58:41.352 --> 58:44.152
       like that, versus
     Mike, who at that time

58:44.154 --> 58:47.556
was the ex-con convicted rapist.

58:47.558 --> 58:51.527
  But Evander was perceived to
  have no chance against Mike.

58:51.529 --> 58:53.362
       When the fight was
        first announced,

58:53.364 --> 58:56.665
        Evander was a 25
        to one underdog.

58:56.667 --> 58:58.033
   I mean, that's huge odds.

58:58.035 --> 59:01.136
  For anybody to be 25 to one
 is like, they've got to shot.

59:01.138 --> 59:02.104
             [ding]

59:03.574 --> 59:08.377
    ANNOUNCER: As expected,
   Mike Tyson comes out fast.

59:08.379 --> 59:10.279
       -Don't push, don't
       push, don't push.

59:10.281 --> 59:11.346
           Let's go.

59:11.348 --> 59:13.482
       EVANDER HOLYFIELD:
     I'm from the hood too.

59:13.484 --> 59:17.319
  I may not act like I'm from
   there, but I'm from there.

59:17.321 --> 59:21.089
   Tyson never did insult me.

59:21.091 --> 59:22.324
       But the press did.

59:22.326 --> 59:25.761
      They talking about,
     Tyson gonna kill you.

59:25.763 --> 59:27.696
        ANNOUNCER: As we
       head for the bell.

59:27.698 --> 59:29.631
           [dinging]

59:29.633 --> 59:32.034
        They continue to
       go after the bell!

59:32.036 --> 59:33.635
       EVANDER HOLYFIELD:
     Ain't nothing that he

59:33.637 --> 59:36.605
     was gonna do that I'm
       not accustomed to.

59:36.607 --> 59:38.574
   ANNOUNCER: No intimidation
    factor here whatsoever.

59:38.576 --> 59:39.374
            -Great!

59:39.376 --> 59:39.841
           Step easy.

59:39.843 --> 59:41.043
             Back.

59:41.045 --> 59:43.078
   EVANDER HOLYFIELD: I knew
     he was gonna be tough,

59:43.080 --> 59:45.514
       but I had watched
       him my whole life.

59:45.516 --> 59:49.184
      It was almost like,
       this is the fight.

59:49.186 --> 59:53.589
      ANNOUNCER: The crowd
       behind Holyfield.

59:53.591 --> 59:55.557
  CROWD: (CHANTING) Holyfield!

59:55.559 --> 59:58.527
      ANNOUNCER: Chants of
 Holyfield as the crowd sensing

59:58.529 --> 01:00:02.965
      that Holyfield might
     have Tyson in trouble.

01:00:02.967 --> 01:00:06.768
 -Mike just wore down from not
  being able to hurt Evander,

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:09.871
 and that was something that he
 had never experienced before.

01:00:09.873 --> 01:00:10.839
  ANNOUNCER: Tyson in trouble!

01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:13.275
      Tyson's ready to go!

01:00:13.277 --> 01:00:17.212
  [inaudible] stops the fight,
   and Holyfield has the win!

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:18.647
       ANNOUNCER: I can't
    believe what I'm seeing.

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:20.115
         It's the most
    unbelievable thing I've

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:22.217
ever been privileged to witness.

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:23.518
      BERNARD HOPKINS: It
      was one of the most

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.153
 complete fights I ever fought.

01:00:31.195 --> 01:00:32.661
     AL BERNSTEIN: That was
      Holyfield's greatest

01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:33.996
          achievement.

01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:37.933
   Evander Holyfield ended up
  being in some of the largest

01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:42.070
    pay per view matches in
   the history of the sport,

01:00:42.072 --> 01:00:44.740
     but it took him a long
       time to get there.

01:00:44.742 --> 01:00:46.708
 LOU DIBELLA: Evander Holyfield
  was not just a good fighter.

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:47.776
    He was a great fighter.

01:00:47.778 --> 01:00:49.544
       He's an underrated
    heavyweight in my mind.

01:00:49.546 --> 01:00:52.714
  Very arguably belongs in the
top 10 heavyweights of all time

01:00:52.716 --> 01:00:53.882
even though he was a little guy.

01:00:53.884 --> 01:00:55.283
  Started as a cruiser weight.

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:56.084
             Tyson.

01:01:00.024 --> 01:01:02.124
    I don't think he became
     what he could've been.

01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:10.132
     DAVID LEONARD: Boxing,
       as we imagine it,

01:01:10.134 --> 01:01:15.537
    is driven by a desire to
    annihilate the opponent.

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:18.607
 The focus is on the external.

01:01:18.609 --> 01:01:22.778
        Looking at what
     boxers themselves say

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:25.747
is that it's about the internal.

01:01:25.749 --> 01:01:27.049
   It's about the discipline.

01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:28.750
     It's about the craft.

01:01:28.752 --> 01:01:30.952
         That it's not
      about the opponent.

01:01:30.954 --> 01:01:34.656
  It's not about the external,
  but it's about the internal.

01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:37.859
        It's about self.

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:40.495
      MICKY WARD: When you
      win, everybody wins.

01:01:40.497 --> 01:01:41.830
 When you lose, you lose alone.

01:01:41.832 --> 01:01:43.965
         And that's the
       truth, because you

01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:45.534
       have to deal with
       that by yourself.

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:50.338
  LOU DIBELLA: There's a large
  degree to which the fighter

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:54.109
     that achieves stardom,
      super stardom, they

01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:56.845
     represent the American
        dream to people.

01:01:56.847 --> 01:01:59.815
       They, the underdog
         that makes it.

01:01:59.817 --> 01:02:00.916
         But I gotta be
       honest with you, I

01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:02.651
     think a lot of that's
      greatly overstated.

01:02:05.522 --> 01:02:07.689
        Mike Tyson, the
     biggest athlete by far

01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:11.693
   of the 1990s, and biggest
     athlete of the 1990s,

01:02:11.695 --> 01:02:15.797
        and certainly a
       super star boxer,

01:02:15.799 --> 01:02:20.302
suffered a lot of ups and downs
 and was never really protected

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:22.337
       by the people that
         surrounded him

01:02:22.339 --> 01:02:25.173
for the majority of his career.

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:28.143
   MIKE TYSON: My self worth,
    even when I was a child,

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:30.846
      depended on how much
     I could hurt someone.

01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:33.415
     And as I got older and
     I met Cus, that, well,

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:37.152
  it continued to be how many
   people I could knock out,

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:40.722
  how fast I could knock them
out, how bad I could hurt them.

01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:45.026
         And so it just
      stayed on that path.

01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:47.028
  LOU DIBELLA: The kid doesn't
have a normal home environment,

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:49.698
     doesn't have a normal
   support system around him,

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.367
and then he's basically trained
   to be a fighting machine.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:53.735
      His life was crazy.

01:02:53.737 --> 01:02:57.305
     Tyson was a pit bull.

01:02:57.307 --> 01:02:59.341
    The ear biting incident
        was a check out.

01:02:59.343 --> 01:03:02.277
      Mike was messed up.

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:05.580
   I'm sure he'd be the first
     one to tell you that.

01:03:05.582 --> 01:03:07.616
    MIKE TYSON: You have to
understand, this is just what I

01:03:07.618 --> 01:03:10.719
  did, seven years of my life,
    eight years of my life.

01:03:10.721 --> 01:03:13.755
     My greatest moment was
     when I stopped boxing.

01:03:13.757 --> 01:03:15.657
    It was just dark for me.

01:03:15.659 --> 01:03:18.894
  Boxing got real dark for me.

01:03:18.896 --> 01:03:22.898
ANNOUNCER: A stunned crowd here
at the MCI Center in Washington

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:30.906
   DC as McBride defeats Mike
 Tyson, who quits on his stool.

01:03:30.908 --> 01:03:32.440
       -I got an ability
       to stay in shape,

01:03:32.442 --> 01:03:34.943
  but I don't got the fighting
 guys, I don't think, anymore.

01:03:34.945 --> 01:03:36.444
       REPORTER: When did
      you recognize that?

01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:37.612
   At what part of the fight?

01:03:37.614 --> 01:03:38.480
         -I don't know.

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:41.483
     Early into the fight.

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:42.751
        I'm just sorry I
      let everybody down.

01:03:42.753 --> 01:03:46.922
   I mean, I just don't have
   this in my heart anymore.

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:48.123
       REPORTER: Did you
       feel as though you

01:03:48.125 --> 01:03:49.624
 had it coming into the fight?

01:03:49.626 --> 01:03:50.926
              -No.

01:03:50.928 --> 01:03:54.329
   I'm just fighting to take
  care of my bills, basically.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.598
  DALTON CONLEY: We know from
  studies of lottery winners,

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.967
        of professional
      athletes, anyone who

01:03:58.969 --> 01:04:01.469
      comes into a sudden
       windfall of money,

01:04:01.471 --> 01:04:03.338
      be careful what you
     wish for, because that

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.106
     creates more problems.

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:07.008
   You have everybody coming
      out of the woodwork

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.276
        to try to get a
     piece of your action.

01:04:15.586 --> 01:04:19.120
   REPORTER: Tyson has pulled
 in an estimated $300 million.

01:04:19.122 --> 01:04:21.056
       He could have made
       more if he hadn't

01:04:21.058 --> 01:04:22.657
   racked up the prison time.

01:04:22.659 --> 01:04:26.428
And who knows how much he's lost
 in lawsuits or to the managers

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:28.230
   he claims ripped him off?

01:04:28.232 --> 01:04:31.499
     The bottom line, Tyson
      then, $300 million.

01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:33.935
     Tyson now, chapter 11.

01:04:33.937 --> 01:04:36.805
      -It's a sport where
        you can be used.

01:04:36.807 --> 01:04:39.875
      There's no training
      about how to handle

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:41.877
   yourself outside the ring.

01:04:41.879 --> 01:04:45.747
   Very few boxers are taught
about how to handle their money.

01:04:45.749 --> 01:04:49.117
   -If you don't have a good
   team of people around you,

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:50.385
    you will kill yourself.

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:53.154
    You will crash and burn,
 because every level of success

01:04:53.156 --> 01:04:56.925
    you have, you hit a wall
  that you have to learn more.

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:58.760
   LOU DIBELLA: I will always
  wonder why Mike Tyson didn't

01:04:58.762 --> 01:05:03.398
declare bankruptcy years before
his tax issues became crushing.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.033
I mean, he clearly was bankrupt.

01:05:05.035 --> 01:05:06.368
         Why didn't he
      declare bankruptcy?

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:09.204
   Because it was in people's
interests to keep his contracts

01:05:09.206 --> 01:05:11.606
      alive with those he
      was doing business.

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:13.174
       -Days after filing
        for bankruptcy,

01:05:13.176 --> 01:05:16.344
boxer Mike Tyson has filed suit
  against his former promoter,

01:05:16.346 --> 01:05:17.479
           Don King.

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:20.181
       -Don was-- I mean,
       he knew everybody.

01:05:20.183 --> 01:05:22.350
       It's like he was a
       step ahead of us.

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:24.419
     How could you prepare
    for something like that?

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:26.321
         You don't know
      who's trying to take

01:05:26.323 --> 01:05:28.523
      from you, who loves
      you, who likes you.

01:05:28.525 --> 01:05:31.626
  You don't know if somebody's
     trying to set you up.

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:33.194
      -Even when you play
       by the rule book,

01:05:33.196 --> 01:05:36.498
you find a person that has that
same energy that the person had

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:41.136
  that was trying to rob you,
  but they won't even give you

01:05:41.138 --> 01:05:44.472
      courtesy of pointing
         a gun at you.

01:05:44.474 --> 01:05:46.574
     They'll rob you and do
     it in black and white.

01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:48.777
      And I seen people do
      worse things to you

01:05:48.779 --> 01:05:54.349
  in corporate settings than I
  seen them do on the street.

01:05:54.351 --> 01:05:55.517
   Take everything from you.

01:05:58.488 --> 01:06:02.757
   BERNARD HOPKINS: There are
bottom feeders that will attach

01:06:02.759 --> 01:06:05.360
        themselves with
       their law license,

01:06:05.362 --> 01:06:11.333
  with their business savvy to
  a fighter from Brooklyn, New

01:06:11.335 --> 01:06:14.869
        York, Philly, or
      any other place that

01:06:14.871 --> 01:06:17.405
don't have really the education.

01:06:17.407 --> 01:06:19.541
   REPORTER: Just ask Atlanta
     car dealer Ken Sanders

01:06:19.543 --> 01:06:21.009
       who took Holyfield
         under his wing

01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:24.946
 when he needed a cosigner for
 a car and became his manager.

01:06:24.948 --> 01:06:26.815
     EVANDER HOLYFIELD: Ken
   Sanders wasn't my manager.

01:06:26.817 --> 01:06:29.050
    I just told people that
      because he ran a car

01:06:29.052 --> 01:06:31.519
        dealership so he
       knew about money.

01:06:31.521 --> 01:06:33.755
       I got into boxing
       because all I had

01:06:33.757 --> 01:06:35.423
 to do what know how to fight.

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:37.292
      I didn't know nobody
     who know about money.

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:40.362
    I don't know nobody who
      made a lot of money.

01:06:40.364 --> 01:06:43.431
 BERNARD HOPKINS: I mean, even
  when you hit the Powerball,

01:06:43.433 --> 01:06:45.000
        the first thing
      people will tell you

01:06:45.002 --> 01:06:47.535
     is, get an accountant
         and a lawyer.

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:50.939
    Well, boxing is the same
 way, but they don't tell you.

01:06:50.941 --> 01:06:55.276
 That's why most athletes wind
   up not having nothing when

01:06:55.278 --> 01:06:59.314
     all the hard labor and
   years in the ring is over.

01:06:59.316 --> 01:07:01.016
      -You ask Mike Tyson,
      how you doing, Mike.

01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:02.984
         He says, just
      living today today.

01:07:02.986 --> 01:07:03.785
    That's what he's doing.

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:05.487
    Just living today today.

01:07:05.489 --> 01:07:07.756
    -You can look at people
     like Evander Holyfield

01:07:07.758 --> 01:07:12.127
 that made hundreds of millions
  of dollars whose houses went

01:07:12.129 --> 01:07:16.765
   into foreclosure and who's
struggling right now to get by.

01:07:16.767 --> 01:07:19.334
 REPORTER: A foreclosure notice
 in the local newspaper states

01:07:19.336 --> 01:07:22.370
     Holyfield defaulted on
    a $10 million bank loan.

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:25.073
     A strange reversal of
     fortune for a champion

01:07:25.075 --> 01:07:27.342
        believed to have
      earned $200 million

01:07:27.344 --> 01:07:29.644
   during his storied career.

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:32.247
         The house that
    Holyfield built may soon

01:07:32.249 --> 01:07:36.117
    become his biggest loss
      outside of the ring.

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:38.853
EVANDER HOLYFIELD: When you get
money, you gotta ask questions.

01:07:38.855 --> 01:07:40.288
        I never did have
       to ask questions,

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:42.257
because I'd never had no money.

01:07:42.259 --> 01:07:43.892
        What happened to
       me is not so much

01:07:43.894 --> 01:07:46.127
      they stole, but they
       did take advantage

01:07:46.129 --> 01:07:48.129
     of what I didn't know.

01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:51.366
  AL BERNSTEIN: They all want
 this boxer to make them money.

01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:54.335
     Once the boxer doesn't
   make them any more money,

01:07:54.337 --> 01:07:56.604
they're cast aside like rubbish.

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:58.339
    LOU DIBELLA: You retire
      with a great record,

01:07:58.341 --> 01:08:00.909
  and then you'd be sitting on
  a stool in your living room,

01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:02.177
    where do I go from here?

01:08:02.179 --> 01:08:03.478
    I don't have any skills.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.546
I'm not trained to do anything.

01:08:04.548 --> 01:08:05.380
       I'm not educated.

01:08:05.382 --> 01:08:06.781
 I don't have a college degree.

01:08:06.783 --> 01:08:08.783
    A lot of guys don't have
      high school degrees.

01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:11.786
 LARRY SLOMAN: It's not at all
  uncommon to have even boxers

01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:15.290
     who had great acclaim
         wind up broke,

01:08:15.292 --> 01:08:19.627
     penniless, as greeters
     at a casino in Vegas.

01:08:19.629 --> 01:08:21.095
      -What you don't hear
        about is the guy

01:08:21.098 --> 01:08:23.665
      that fights on ESPN
       four times a year,

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:27.335
 and after he pays his manager,
 and his trainer, and everyone

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:30.104
       involved, is still
      at the poverty line.

01:08:30.107 --> 01:08:32.740
   The budgets on ESPN allow
     a guy in a main event

01:08:32.742 --> 01:08:35.109
  to get paid about 15 grand.

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:36.743
       Like I said, split
        that money off,

01:08:36.746 --> 01:08:38.479
      train for number of
     weeks for that fight,

01:08:38.482 --> 01:08:41.282
 and you're making-- You could
   make more money, honestly,

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:42.884
        taking a minimum
      wage job and working

01:08:42.886 --> 01:08:44.953
   a little bit of over time.

01:08:44.955 --> 01:08:46.955
     The minimum salary in
     Major League Baseball,

01:08:46.957 --> 01:08:50.358
      even in minor league
     baseball, is livable.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.926
      There is no minimum
     salary for a fighter.

01:08:52.929 --> 01:08:57.932
      The top 1% fighters
  probably make 99% of money.

01:08:57.934 --> 01:09:01.536
    -Boxing is laissez-faire
      capitalism run amok.

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:05.073
    There is essentially no
     one running the ship.

01:09:05.075 --> 01:09:07.841
There's different organizations
    that run a piece of it.

01:09:07.844 --> 01:09:12.113
There's promoters who go up and
 down and control parts of it,

01:09:12.115 --> 01:09:16.783
   but there are essentially
        no regulations.

01:09:16.786 --> 01:09:19.587
  FRANCISCO AGUILAR: Boxing is
 regulated at the state level.

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:21.456
      You have Nevada with
       its set of rules,

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:23.524
  you have California with its
set of rules, you have New York,

01:09:23.527 --> 01:09:24.759
      you have New Jersey.

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:26.594
    Jurisdictions will have
    a different perspective

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:28.328
         on a different
       matter, and nobody

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:30.064
         is on the same
       page at all times.

01:09:30.066 --> 01:09:32.667
   Most people think that we
   need a federal commission

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:35.236
to regulate the sport of boxing.

01:09:35.238 --> 01:09:37.404
     The federal government
   tempted to regulate boxing

01:09:37.407 --> 01:09:39.307
 by the passage of the Ali Act.

01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:42.143
   It's given some authority
   to the federal government

01:09:42.145 --> 01:09:45.747
     to enforce boxing from
    a business perspective.

01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:49.984
However, there has not been any
 prosecution or implementation

01:09:49.986 --> 01:09:52.487
 of the Ali Act for a fighter.

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:57.192
   -Why is it every sport in
  America is regulated or has

01:09:57.194 --> 01:10:00.461
       some type of union
       and boxing don't?

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:10.772
     -In other sports like
  baseball, football, tennis,

01:10:10.774 --> 01:10:14.108
  you have individuals who are
 well educated in those sports

01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:17.011
 to help guide those champions
      through their effort

01:10:17.013 --> 01:10:18.146
        and their time.

01:10:18.148 --> 01:10:20.114
       -If you're an NFL
   player, or an NBA player,

01:10:20.116 --> 01:10:21.616
       or a Major League
        Baseball player,

01:10:21.618 --> 01:10:23.618
   there is at least a core.

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:24.852
       You have the team.

01:10:24.854 --> 01:10:27.422
  You have whatever resources
     they have to help you.

01:10:27.424 --> 01:10:29.023
      You have the league
    that has some resources.

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:39.267
        BERNARD HOPKINS:
        Who do we go to?

01:10:39.269 --> 01:10:42.370
     It's crazy to put your
       body and your mind

01:10:42.372 --> 01:10:44.839
     through this hard way
       of making a living

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:46.741
 for yourself and your family.

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:51.980
And to wind up with nothing and
  not even your health, to me,

01:10:51.982 --> 01:10:53.715
           is a sin.

01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:55.083
        MAUREEN SCHAFER:
        We as a country,

01:10:55.085 --> 01:10:58.286
  are in love with our sports,
but when these two fighters step

01:10:58.288 --> 01:11:01.389
    into a ring, there is a
     level of violence that

01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:03.758
      is unlike any other
         sport in terms

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.427
   of duration and intensity.

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:09.631
    When a fighter receives
   a blow that is so severe,

01:11:09.633 --> 01:11:11.332
     what's going on inside
     the head is the brain

01:11:11.334 --> 01:11:13.835
  is suddenly slammed against
     the back of your skull

01:11:13.837 --> 01:11:16.638
    and then thrown forward
 again as the head snaps back.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.873
         It's commonly
      called a concussion.

01:11:26.916 --> 01:11:30.318
     It can swell and cause
      long term hematomas,

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.887
     bleeding on the brain,
      memory loss, strokes

01:11:32.889 --> 01:11:34.922
        or aneurysms, or
        vessel breakage.

01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:47.735
  It can cause death depending
   on how severe, how acute,

01:11:47.737 --> 01:11:50.571
    where the brain actually
       impacts the skull.

01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:54.042
    It has happened where a
  fighter will leave the ring.

01:11:54.044 --> 01:11:56.210
     Whether they've won or
     lost, they look fine.

01:11:56.212 --> 01:11:59.047
    They head out to dinner,
    everything's wonderful,

01:11:59.049 --> 01:12:01.015
      and one, to two, to
       three days later,

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:03.651
  something traumatic happens.

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:05.119
       LOU DIBELLA: I had
       a young champion,

01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:06.921
 a guy named Leavander Johnson.

01:12:06.923 --> 01:12:07.955
He was walking out of the ring.

01:12:07.957 --> 01:12:09.791
        I walked out of
      the ring behind him

01:12:09.793 --> 01:12:11.959
   and I saw he was a little
     unsteady on his feet.

01:12:11.961 --> 01:12:13.761
       He put his arm on
        me and I walked

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:15.697
 him back to his dressing room.

01:12:15.699 --> 01:12:18.566
 He was apologizing for losing.

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:20.101
   And I'll never forget it.

01:12:20.103 --> 01:12:22.003
       He sat on a stool,
      then he looked at me

01:12:22.005 --> 01:12:24.072
       and he said, Lou,
       I have a headache.

01:12:24.074 --> 01:12:27.442
And then he fell forward and he
 never regained consciousness.

01:12:27.444 --> 01:12:31.312
    He died, I think, it was
     five, six days later.

01:12:31.314 --> 01:12:35.283
  -Every society, for the most
 part, on the face of the Earth

01:12:35.285 --> 01:12:38.386
        has some primal
       need for violence.

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:42.323
       It's always there,
     that bloodthirstiness.

01:12:45.595 --> 01:12:49.097
GEORGE WILLIS: It's human nature
 to be fascinated by violence.

01:12:49.099 --> 01:12:51.632
    We hear a car wreck, we
     go see what happened.

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:52.767
         Horror movies.

01:12:52.769 --> 01:12:56.371
    How's somebody gonna be
    eaten alive or torn up?

01:12:56.373 --> 01:12:57.739
    It's all over the place.

01:12:57.741 --> 01:13:01.609
     We are just attracted
       by confrontation,

01:13:01.611 --> 01:13:04.512
  by conflict, by controversy.

01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:10.084
  That's what sells and that's
   what boxing tries to sell.

01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:13.254
FRANCISCO AGUILAR: Boxing needs
  something that can say, hey,

01:13:13.256 --> 01:13:16.124
there is support for a fighter.

01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:18.559
  The fighter is the one who's
   putting his life in danger

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.762
     to enter that ring and
     provide entertainment

01:13:20.764 --> 01:13:22.163
   to everybody that's there.

01:13:22.165 --> 01:13:24.832
   However, we have to weigh
     the resources we have

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:26.501
        with the actual
    regulation of the sport.

01:13:26.503 --> 01:13:29.370
     Over the last year, we
  generated about $5.5 million

01:13:29.372 --> 01:13:32.473
      in tax revenue just
       from ticket sales.

01:13:32.475 --> 01:13:35.109
   The state legislature then
     makes an appropriation

01:13:35.111 --> 01:13:37.545
  to the Athletic Commission,
      and that allocation

01:13:37.547 --> 01:13:39.647
       is about $450,000.

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:43.184
  So there's a huge disparity
 from a regulative prospective.

01:13:43.186 --> 01:13:45.453
   LOU DIBELLA: I'm concerned
   right now about the sport.

01:13:45.455 --> 01:13:49.290
  People in life have a right
   to take risks and a right

01:13:49.292 --> 01:13:51.426
       to live the lives
       they want to live.

01:13:51.428 --> 01:13:54.529
   Now, that being said, it's
   barbaric in a lot of ways

01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:58.566
  that there's no standardized
       health and safety

01:13:58.568 --> 01:13:59.934
 criteria in the United States.

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:01.569
       Think about that.

01:14:01.571 --> 01:14:02.937
       It's preposterous.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:05.773
  LARRY SLOMAN: It's high time
 that boxing began to regulate

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:08.776
      just like other pro
      sports like the NFL.

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:13.414
  -When there's no checks and
  balances, there's a problem.

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:14.882
     MAUREEN SCHAFER: When
     you see the people who

01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:17.585
  come from nothing, who come
    from less than nothing,

01:14:17.587 --> 01:14:20.421
      to see them perform
      and to see them give

01:14:20.423 --> 01:14:24.826
    such great entertainment
      is an amazing thing.

01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:27.595
   But as important as it is
    for us to celebrate them

01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:30.064
    at the top of where they
     are, it's as important

01:14:30.066 --> 01:14:32.867
       that we figure out
       how to carry them

01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:34.836
  when they need us the most.

01:14:34.838 --> 01:14:36.504
     LOU DIBELLA: There are
   some great success stories

01:14:36.506 --> 01:14:37.939
         and some great
      stories of those who

01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:42.443
     escape prison, escape
    the street and make it.

01:14:42.445 --> 01:14:44.579
   But for every one of those
   guys, there's a sad story

01:14:44.581 --> 01:14:46.647
     and there's a story of
    someone who's exploited,

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:49.383
or a story of someone who loses
 their health in the long term,

01:14:49.385 --> 01:14:52.153
    or a story that somebody
     who becomes a champion

01:14:52.155 --> 01:14:54.322
      and toils for years,
       and then winds up

01:14:54.324 --> 01:14:56.591
retired with virtually nothing.

01:14:56.593 --> 01:14:59.093
  It's the American dream and
  it's the American nightmare.

01:15:15.778 --> 01:15:17.745
 MIKE TYSON: When I'm over here
  and I'm looking at the Vegas

01:15:17.747 --> 01:15:20.648
  strip, I can think about all
the trouble I got in over there.

01:15:20.650 --> 01:15:22.083
  All the drugs I used there.

01:15:25.321 --> 01:15:28.222
  I never even think about all
 the great fights I had there.

01:15:28.224 --> 01:15:29.957
       I just think about
         all the things

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:34.095
      I did there, wasn't
         really moral.

01:15:34.097 --> 01:15:37.865
       All I did is knock
   people out, screw people,

01:15:37.867 --> 01:15:40.034
      have sex with women,
       get high on drugs.

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:45.072
      When me and my wife
      first got together,

01:15:45.074 --> 01:15:46.340
   I was a full blown addict.

01:15:51.214 --> 01:15:54.348
       My daughter passed
    away at four years old.

01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:56.918
      What happened was a
    tragic accident at home.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.252
    That's my lowest point.

01:16:02.992 --> 01:16:04.559
       When I was at the
      hospital, I realized

01:16:04.561 --> 01:16:06.994
      that other people's
    children were dying too.

01:16:06.996 --> 01:16:09.330
     And those people, just
      because I'm famous,

01:16:09.332 --> 01:16:11.299
  they took out of their way,
   left their dying children,

01:16:11.301 --> 01:16:13.568
   their sick children, came
 over here and prayed with me.

01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:14.769
  Then I realized, well, hey.

01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:16.837
    Their baby's dying too.

01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:19.473
 So what makes you so important
   that you think you should

01:16:19.475 --> 01:16:21.175
       be mad and angry,
     want to kill somebody,

01:16:21.177 --> 01:16:22.977
        and do-- just do
      this whole tough guy

01:16:22.979 --> 01:16:24.912
stuff because your baby's dying?

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:26.180
       Their baby's dying
       too, and they left

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:27.481
       them to come over
     here and talk to you.

01:16:27.483 --> 01:16:29.550
 You ain't shit, motherfucker.

01:16:29.552 --> 01:16:31.185
  You don't care about nobody.

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:32.453
       These people left
       their fucking baby

01:16:32.455 --> 01:16:34.922
       to talk to your no
       good fucking ass.

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:37.158
        And, um, that's
       just what it was.

01:16:40.797 --> 01:16:43.230
     And it's not about me.

01:16:43.232 --> 01:16:45.166
  The world's bigger than me.

01:16:48.538 --> 01:16:50.905
      My wife, she stayed
        by me and said,

01:16:50.907 --> 01:16:52.540
 we're gonna get through this.

01:16:52.542 --> 01:16:53.941
  Just kept it very positive.

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:54.842
      Constantly positive.

01:16:57.614 --> 01:17:00.715
    I just wanted to change.

01:17:00.717 --> 01:17:03.384
     I wanted to break the
     chain of self bondage

01:17:03.386 --> 01:17:05.753
   that my mother and father
   and her mother and father

01:17:05.755 --> 01:17:07.121
         probably had.

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:10.858
 And I wanted it to change with
  me so my kids wouldn't have

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:14.595
       to deal with that
        same suffering.

01:17:14.597 --> 01:17:17.932
  I'm so happy to be involved
    with the recovery world.

01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:21.135
  I met a bunch of people that
   were just amazing people.

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:22.203
    They didn't quit on me.

01:17:22.205 --> 01:17:23.571
      They didn't give up
      on me like the rest

01:17:23.573 --> 01:17:26.340
   of the people in my life.

01:17:26.342 --> 01:17:29.010
   It's an ongoing struggle.

01:17:29.012 --> 01:17:32.146
   The pain never goes away.

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:35.116
 I'm never in a situation that
   I'm so secure that I could

01:17:35.118 --> 01:17:39.654
never fall back into that nasty,
  dirty, disgusting, wretched

01:17:39.656 --> 01:17:41.088
  individual that I once was.

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:45.526
       I never think that
      guy's gone totally.

01:17:45.528 --> 01:17:47.294
     It's time now where I
    have to deal with things

01:17:47.296 --> 01:17:50.231
  from a serious perspective,
    and how me and my family

01:17:50.233 --> 01:17:51.532
     are gonna evolve from
       that perspective.

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:01.676
     EVANDER HOLYFIELD: He
    had to make adjustments.

01:18:01.678 --> 01:18:04.845
   Adjustment's part of life.

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:06.047
        Disappointment.

01:18:06.049 --> 01:18:07.715
   That's the biggest fight.

01:18:07.717 --> 01:18:11.018
      You want to see how
      strong somebody is?

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.587
  Have them get disappointed.

01:18:13.589 --> 01:18:15.523
     ANNOUNCER: It's over.

01:18:15.525 --> 01:18:16.490
           That's it.

01:18:16.492 --> 01:18:17.425
          It is over.

01:18:17.427 --> 01:18:18.759
     ANNOUNCER: That's it.

01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:22.730
  ANNOUNCER: Evander Holyfield
  has never been knocked out,

01:18:22.732 --> 01:18:27.635
      and Riddick Bowe is
       the one to do it.

01:18:27.637 --> 01:18:30.004
 ANNOUNCER: If I was Holyfield
  or any of his team members,

01:18:30.006 --> 01:18:33.941
I'd really have to reevaluate if
 he's fit to continue to fight.

01:18:33.943 --> 01:18:35.876
  With all the health problems
   and the heart conditions,

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:37.545
      is Evander Holyfield
     just completely done?

01:18:37.547 --> 01:18:40.047
         We don't know.

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:41.148
        BERNARD HOPKINS:
        My mother passed

01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:44.151
  before I fought Mike Tyson.

01:18:44.153 --> 01:18:48.289
    My brother passed before
     I fought Riddick Bowe.

01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:50.224
     I had a lot of tragedy
    in my family and stuff.

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:53.194
     So, you know, you have
      to put them behind.

01:18:53.196 --> 01:18:54.695
       ANNOUNCER: And the
        continuing life

01:18:54.697 --> 01:18:56.297
         in the ring of
       Evander Holyfield.

01:18:56.299 --> 01:18:58.165
Don't count me out yet, he says.

01:18:58.167 --> 01:19:01.435
     And tonight, with some
      new gas in the tank.

01:19:01.437 --> 01:19:04.305
 LOU DIBELLA: Evander Holyfield
     was an all time great.

01:19:04.307 --> 01:19:06.674
 But Evander didn't understand
      that the shell life

01:19:06.676 --> 01:19:08.242
    of a fighter is limited.

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:12.046
      ANNOUNCER: We may be
   seeing the end of an era.

01:19:12.048 --> 01:19:16.817
        And I think they
      throw in the towel.

01:19:16.819 --> 01:19:18.886
  LOU DIBELLA: I think he was
 forced to fight way too long.

01:19:18.888 --> 01:19:23.257
Fights at the end of his career
  are for virtually no money.

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:26.560
 GEORGE WILLIS: Evander is very
 confident in what he believes.

01:19:26.562 --> 01:19:29.096
        His stubbornness
      can be his greatest

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:34.001
         asset and his
      greatest liability.

01:19:34.003 --> 01:19:36.771
  EVANDER HOLYFIELD: I didn't
   get into boxing for money.

01:19:36.773 --> 01:19:39.907
  I got into boxing because I
  wanted to be the very best.

01:19:39.909 --> 01:19:41.942
   I'm the only person who's
 been the heavyweight champion

01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:46.580
of the world five times, because
 I got that many opportunities.

01:19:46.582 --> 01:19:48.849
       Everybody's gonna
       get off the path,

01:19:48.851 --> 01:19:50.451
        but the point is
       to get back on it.

01:19:50.453 --> 01:19:54.255
        Forgive yourself
        and get back on.

01:19:54.257 --> 01:19:56.390
  REPORTER: Evander Holyfield
 has faced plenty of opponents

01:19:56.392 --> 01:19:58.192
        in the ring, but
       nothing like this.

01:19:58.194 --> 01:20:00.728
    Together with his friend
   and financier Yank Barry,

01:20:00.730 --> 01:20:02.563
      they plan to deliver
       food aid and help

01:20:02.565 --> 01:20:04.532
        resettle Syrian
       refugees in a home

01:20:04.534 --> 01:20:06.734
  supplied by Barry's charity.

01:20:06.736 --> 01:20:07.868
       EVANDER HOLYFIELD:
        Yank Barry used

01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:10.504
my likeness to draw the people.

01:20:10.506 --> 01:20:14.842
 I was on my last leg, but this
   man gave me an opportunity

01:20:14.844 --> 01:20:17.044
      to fight back these
        people who were

01:20:17.046 --> 01:20:19.346
     taking my memorabilia
         and all this.

01:20:19.348 --> 01:20:22.683
       He did it himself.

01:20:22.685 --> 01:20:25.286
 GEORGE WILLIS: I think Evander
  has come to that realization

01:20:25.288 --> 01:20:28.956
  that he needs to be Evander
 Holyfield and not necessarily

01:20:28.958 --> 01:20:31.125
    Evander Holyfield, four
   time heavyweight champion

01:20:31.127 --> 01:20:32.426
         of the world.

01:20:32.428 --> 01:20:33.894
     EVANDER HOLYFIELD: If
    it wasn't for that Boys

01:20:33.896 --> 01:20:37.765
   Club and other people who
   had money who sponsored me

01:20:37.767 --> 01:20:41.802
      as a kid, I wouldn't
          be who I am.

01:20:41.804 --> 01:20:44.705
    The work that I'm doing
    now with Global Village,

01:20:44.707 --> 01:20:46.807
        that's what life
        is really about.

01:20:46.809 --> 01:20:48.375
      I go to Heaven, they
   ain't gonna be asking me,

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:50.044
   how many times you became
    the heavyweight champion

01:20:50.046 --> 01:20:51.178
         of the world.

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:53.147
    He's gonna ask, what did
     you do for the people.

01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:56.050
  The reason why you exist in
 the world is to help somebody.

01:20:56.052 --> 01:20:58.185
     Not just for yourself.

01:20:58.187 --> 01:21:00.187
    -One of my best friends
       was Muhammad Ali.

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:01.422
       Muhammad's health
        started failing

01:21:01.424 --> 01:21:05.159
    and I had to pick a new
      goodwill ambassador.

01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:05.960
        It was Evander.

01:21:05.962 --> 01:21:08.028
  And Evander brought in Mike.

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:10.564
-He brought-- You bought him in?

01:21:10.566 --> 01:21:12.199
             -Yep.

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:15.202
  -Evander Holyfield has been
    very gracious with Mike.

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:18.839
       Mike bit a portion
        of his ear off.

01:21:18.841 --> 01:21:22.376
that takes a lot of compassion,
  a lot of love in your heart,

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:23.444
      to forgive someone.

01:21:23.446 --> 01:21:26.347
     -If you forgive, then
       you'll have peace.

01:21:26.349 --> 01:21:28.816
 You won't have people fighting
    each other all the time.

01:21:28.818 --> 01:21:31.819
  That's what makes the world
  go around is people forgive.

01:21:31.821 --> 01:21:33.921
    -What did you think when
  Evander called you and said,

01:21:33.923 --> 01:21:36.523
       I want you to get
   involved in this project.

01:21:36.525 --> 01:21:38.325
   -Well, it's not like I was
   doing anything, of course.

01:21:38.327 --> 01:21:39.126
           You know?

01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:40.494
     I said, hey, um, yeah.

01:21:40.496 --> 01:21:41.662
              OK.

01:21:41.664 --> 01:21:43.631
   -Well, Mike always talked
      about that he never

01:21:43.633 --> 01:21:46.533
     wanted to be involved
      in the sport again.

01:21:46.535 --> 01:21:48.569
       But now that he's
      resurrected himself,

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:50.504
       you see him going
        back to boxing,

01:21:50.506 --> 01:21:55.042
establishing his own promotional
    company to not only help

01:21:55.044 --> 01:21:58.545
    the young boxers develop
       into good boxers,

01:21:58.547 --> 01:22:02.116
   but to help them not make
    some of the bad choices

01:22:02.118 --> 01:22:03.217
         that he made.

01:22:03.219 --> 01:22:04.618
       LOU DIBELLA: I was
     very critical of Mike.

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:05.986
        I'm happy to see
      him at a place where

01:22:05.988 --> 01:22:07.955
     I think he's much more
   at peace, and at a better

01:22:07.957 --> 01:22:10.524
     place in his life than
      I've ever seen him.

01:22:10.526 --> 01:22:11.992
         The Mike Tyson
       that's there right

01:22:11.994 --> 01:22:15.396
  now is an honest guy trying
     to do the best he can

01:22:15.398 --> 01:22:17.197
        to be happy and
       live a good life.

01:22:17.199 --> 01:22:20.434
GEORGE WILLIS: His core love of
boxing stems from the amateurs.

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:22.803
     That's when it was all
  about the love of the game.

01:22:22.805 --> 01:22:24.838
 It wasn't so much about money.

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.541
   And that's when boxing and
  the sport is at its purest.

01:22:30.446 --> 01:22:33.013
AL BERNSTEIN: It's the adversity
 that you face as a boxer that

01:22:33.015 --> 01:22:35.516
       really brings out
       the true champion.

01:22:35.518 --> 01:22:38.185
     Bernard, and Mike, and
      Evander, all of them

01:22:38.187 --> 01:22:39.853
        have faced that
       kind of adversity.

01:22:39.855 --> 01:22:43.590
  Inside the ring, to be sure,
 but outside the ring as well.

01:22:43.592 --> 01:22:47.328
And I don't think we can measure
the arc of some of these people

01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:49.496
      until we see them go
    through the adversities.

01:22:49.498 --> 01:22:53.133
   And when they do, it takes
  a lot to come back from it.

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:56.236
   The one thing that I think
    keeps them coming back,

01:22:56.238 --> 01:22:58.939
       both in the boxing
       ring and in life,

01:22:58.941 --> 01:23:03.143
    is the fact that boxers
       have perseverance.

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:07.614
  -I'm on a different mission
now that some ain't gonna like.

01:23:07.616 --> 01:23:08.582
      And they shouldn't.

01:23:12.855 --> 01:23:15.489
    What I would like to do
   in my second half of life

01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:17.458
        is to raise what
      they would perceive

01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:20.461
     to be hell amongst the
    people that want to keep

01:23:20.463 --> 01:23:25.733
   a society of prey to exist
   so they can take advantage

01:23:25.735 --> 01:23:28.535
    of the backs, and blood,
    and tears of a fighter.

01:23:28.537 --> 01:23:30.804
   -We need to start thinking
 about things in the long term,

01:23:30.806 --> 01:23:32.806
      and I think some of
      that responsibility

01:23:32.808 --> 01:23:35.242
  falls on those that interact
with the fighters on a more day

01:23:35.244 --> 01:23:36.610
         to day basis.

01:23:36.612 --> 01:23:38.612
 There's one particular fighter
  that has really stepped out

01:23:38.614 --> 01:23:40.447
      in front, and that's
        Bernard Hopkins.

01:23:40.449 --> 01:23:42.916
 BERNARD HOPKINS: Being a part
 of Golden Boy Promotion, what

01:23:42.918 --> 01:23:47.354
 I want to do is to take every
 fighter that comes through me.

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:51.058
       You've got to have
       your own account.

01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:55.195
       You've got to have
       your own attorney.

01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:58.332
    You've got to know what
     the business is about.

01:24:01.437 --> 01:24:04.104
 -This was the sport of kings.

01:24:04.106 --> 01:24:05.606
This sport changed history, man.

01:24:05.608 --> 01:24:07.141
     This sport had more to
    do with the advancement

01:24:07.143 --> 01:24:10.044
  of the civil rights movement
     than any other sport.

01:24:10.046 --> 01:24:14.181
    From Jack Johnson to Joe
     Lewis to Muhammad Ali.

01:24:14.183 --> 01:24:16.417
    This is a sport that is
    ingrained in the fabric

01:24:16.419 --> 01:24:17.718
        of this country.

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.854
         I think that a
    resurgence is possible,

01:24:20.856 --> 01:24:25.059
      but there has to be
       some changes made.

01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:26.860
     NAAZIM RICHARDSON: The
ultimate opponent for a fighter

01:24:26.862 --> 01:24:28.762
           is truth.

01:24:28.764 --> 01:24:29.963
     If he can be truthful
         with himself,

01:24:29.965 --> 01:24:31.832
     if he can look at his
      limitations and then

01:24:31.834 --> 01:24:33.967
         work on them.

01:24:33.969 --> 01:24:38.072
  If he can understand what he
 does well and then enhance it.

01:24:38.074 --> 01:24:40.541
  But he has to deal in truth.

01:24:40.543 --> 01:24:44.578
    -When you lose, you can
      only blame yourself.

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:47.748
     Go back and just look
     at what you did wrong.

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:51.785
 It's the ones that know how to
lose, and make yourself better,

01:24:51.787 --> 01:24:54.021
         and come back.

01:24:54.023 --> 01:24:55.022
         That's boxing.

01:24:59.428 --> 01:25:03.464
  BERNARD HOPKINS: In boxing,
  you have to have challenges,

01:25:03.466 --> 01:25:08.535
and you use those challenges to
 take it to a different level.

01:25:08.537 --> 01:25:10.938
         I'm a fighter.

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:13.740
   I'm that type of guy that
  could've been anything else

01:25:13.742 --> 01:25:17.711
        in my life if I
       chose to be that.

01:25:17.713 --> 01:25:21.615
   We all have talent in us.

01:25:21.617 --> 01:25:24.985
    You just gotta find it.

01:25:24.987 --> 01:25:28.755
 EVANDER HOLYFIELD: Everybody's
 tested in one way or another.

01:25:28.757 --> 01:25:30.791
         It ain't easy.

01:25:30.793 --> 01:25:33.127
        Your priorities
       gotta be lined up.

01:25:33.129 --> 01:25:36.330
      I have just as many
 distractions as somebody else.

01:25:36.332 --> 01:25:38.065
but I really wanted to be great.

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:43.504
     Victory is how you're
        able to inspire

01:25:43.506 --> 01:25:48.208
  people to want to be better.

01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:49.610
      MIKE TYSON: This all
     comes down to family,

01:25:49.612 --> 01:25:51.912
     love, and forgiveness,
          and respect.

01:25:51.914 --> 01:25:56.283
 Bridging the gaps between who
   I am and who I want to be.

01:25:56.285 --> 01:25:58.685
      I'll find different
        ways of becoming

01:25:58.687 --> 01:25:59.853
  more conscious about myself.

01:26:03.526 --> 01:26:06.727
    Human beings think a lot
    of themselves, you know.

01:26:06.729 --> 01:26:08.462
     To think that we'll be
     that privileged to see

01:26:08.464 --> 01:26:11.265
     the end of the world.

01:26:11.267 --> 01:26:14.668
   I don't think we're gonna
      have that privilege.

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:18.005
     I know there's things
      that have been bad,

01:26:18.007 --> 01:26:21.775
but you have to look at all the
good that's happening out here.

01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:24.878
I see a new birth in the world.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:26.647
          I see people
    respecting people more.

01:26:29.151 --> 01:26:31.552
       We have to evolve.

01:26:31.554 --> 01:26:34.188
     This is a great world,
     and it's the best deal

01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:35.322
       we ever got in our
        life, you know.

01:26:35.324 --> 01:26:37.124
          Life itself.

01:26:37.126 --> 01:26:38.025
     We got it for nothing.

01:26:38.027 --> 01:26:39.526
 Look at all we got in return.
