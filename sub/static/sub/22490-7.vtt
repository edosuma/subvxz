00:19.119 --> 00:21.019
It's alive!

00:35.702 --> 00:36.828
Aah!

00:39.539 --> 00:43.407
Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!

00:50.050 --> 00:51.608
Whew.

00:51.651 --> 00:54.677
I... ing hate you.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.553
You're gonna take
good care of my car, right?

01:00.593 --> 01:03.926
You guys got nothing to worry about.
I'm a professional.

01:03.963 --> 01:07.194
- A professional what?
- Come on, I'm hungry.

01:22.782 --> 01:24.477
Hey, you're not Michael.

01:24.517 --> 01:25.506
You can talk?

01:25.552 --> 01:29.079
If he can talk, I bet he can party!

01:29.122 --> 01:30.885
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:30.924 --> 01:35.588
Playing, playing with a car

01:35.628 --> 01:37.653
Ha ha ha! Yeah!

01:37.697 --> 01:41.155
Playing, playing with a car

01:43.203 --> 01:47.401
'Cause after parking limos...

01:47.440 --> 01:49.499
Blech!

01:49.542 --> 01:52.978
A car that talks

01:53.012 --> 01:56.448
Said it was a bad time

01:56.483 --> 01:57.950
For a turbo boost

01:59.519 --> 02:02.716
I said it was the right time

02:02.755 --> 02:05.622
For a raunchy pursuit

02:05.658 --> 02:06.955
Yeah

02:06.993 --> 02:11.589
Playing, playing with a car

02:13.833 --> 02:18.202
Playing, playing with a car

02:22.375 --> 02:23.865
Kitt?

02:25.812 --> 02:27.211
Kitt?

02:33.887 --> 02:36.788
Stop farting.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.223
That looked like my toe.

02:39.259 --> 02:41.022
Why you in such a hurry?
Going to the ball?

02:41.060 --> 02:43.528
Ha ha ha. Not anymore.

02:43.563 --> 02:45.155
We love you, Grandma.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.462
Oh, I don't like it here.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.060
Everybody's trying to kill me.

02:50.103 --> 02:53.664
Oh, mom, nobody's trying to kill you.

02:53.706 --> 02:56.732
Steve, we're gonna be late for the movie.

02:56.776 --> 02:59.176
We'll see you next week.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.304
Good-bye, Grandma!

03:00.346 --> 03:01.506
OK, dear.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.493
Ohh! Ooh!

03:25.338 --> 03:26.566
Aah!

03:29.776 --> 03:31.437
Eee!

03:43.189 --> 03:44.417
Argh!

03:45.692 --> 03:48.217
What the... Oh, no! Uhh!

03:48.261 --> 03:49.353
Ow!

03:58.137 --> 03:59.297
Yeah.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.408
Lights out means lights out.

04:12.218 --> 04:13.776
Bleh!

04:13.820 --> 04:18.052
Aah! Oh, gosh! Oh! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

04:25.265 --> 04:27.893
OK, everybody, no touching.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.732
They're eighteen now.
That's so awesome.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.169
Why's that?

04:32.205 --> 04:34.969
Because, you know, they're legal.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.498
Dude, you're, like, thirty-five.

04:36.542 --> 04:38.601
Thanks, everybody. See you soon.

04:41.147 --> 04:43.615
What's the latest fabulous news,
everybody?

04:43.650 --> 04:46.676
<i>The Mary-Kate and Ashley in Moscow</i>
DVD hit number one!

04:46.719 --> 04:47.708
I knew it would.

04:47.754 --> 04:49.187
The Olsen twins tropical toothpaste...

04:49.222 --> 04:52.123
was endorsed
by the American Tooth Association.

04:52.158 --> 04:54.888
I just saved a ton of money
by switching to Geico.

04:54.927 --> 04:56.394
- Great!
- Great!

04:57.997 --> 04:59.225
- Yes, chief?
- Yes, chief?

04:59.265 --> 05:01.426
- What? The city's in trouble?
- What? The city's in trouble?

05:01.467 --> 05:03.025
- We'll be right there.
- We'll be right there.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.162
- Olsen twin powers activate!
- Olsen twin powers activate!

05:06.639 --> 05:10.666
Form of a giant eagle!

05:10.710 --> 05:14.111
Shape of a bucket of water.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.514
Glee glee glee glee.
Glee glee glee. Gleek!

05:22.088 --> 05:23.749
Oh, my God!

05:35.468 --> 05:36.867
Oof!

05:38.438 --> 05:41.839
Oh, I hope the Olsen twins
get here in time.

05:42.742 --> 05:45.939
The dragon's tearing up the city.
We've gotta stop him.

05:45.978 --> 05:47.377
Let's do it, Mary-Kate.

05:49.615 --> 05:50.741
Ohh!

05:53.252 --> 05:54.549
- Aah!
- Aah!

06:02.428 --> 06:05.727
Ew! Did you see that?

06:05.765 --> 06:08.962
I totally did.
His skin is totally irritated.

06:09.001 --> 06:11.162
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

06:13.539 --> 06:17.441
Oh, you're not an evil red dragon,
are you?

06:17.477 --> 06:21.743
Oh, you're just a harmless dragon
with a bad skin condition.

06:21.781 --> 06:25.080
And that's what
Olsen oil skin cream was made for.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.915
Now lay down.

06:26.953 --> 06:29.387
Oh, doesn't this feel good?

06:35.595 --> 06:36.562
- We did it!
- We did it!

06:36.596 --> 06:37.824
Ahh...

06:38.931 --> 06:40.592
Oomph!

06:41.968 --> 06:43.833
Hooray! Hooray!

06:48.975 --> 06:51.273
Next time on <i>The Olsen Twins...</i>

06:53.413 --> 06:56.314
- Sandwich?
- No, thanks.

06:56.349 --> 06:59.512
Ha ha ha ha!

07:04.123 --> 07:05.488
Eh.

07:05.525 --> 07:08.824
Mommy, there's a monster in my closet.

07:08.861 --> 07:10.351
I know.

07:12.899 --> 07:14.389
He's dead.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.901
Ah, it's just a car.

07:24.577 --> 07:27.740
Murder's a new trick for a robot, isn't it?
Respond.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.078
I did not murder him.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.483
Must have done something
real bad to piss you off.

07:33.519 --> 07:34.679
Respond.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.154
I did not murder him.

07:37.190 --> 07:40.353
Or maybe you just hate humans.
Is that it?

07:40.393 --> 07:43.089
I did not murder him!

07:45.431 --> 07:47.331
Yeah, right.

07:59.278 --> 08:03.476
Meet George Jetson, his boy Elroy...

08:03.516 --> 08:06.815
daughter Judy, Jane, his wife.

08:06.853 --> 08:09.845
Their lives
have been tarnished by murder...

08:09.889 --> 08:12.585
murder by way
of a broken windowpane...

08:12.625 --> 08:15.219
and a fatal fall to the ground below.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.965
Who floats buildings that high up,
I'm asking you.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.762
They put treadmills
on the outside of them.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.234
You believe that?

08:23.269 --> 08:25.567
He could have fallen off
one of those things, for all we know.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.869
Damn, we are stupid in the future.

08:27.907 --> 08:31.035
One detective knew it was no accident.

08:31.077 --> 08:33.875
Don't you realize this is safety glass?

08:33.913 --> 08:36.711
It would have taken a robot to...
Oh, God!

08:40.520 --> 08:43.977
One man would speak out
for Rosie's innocence.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.617
Ridiculous. My robots are harmless.

08:46.659 --> 08:48.286
With the three laws of robotics...

08:48.327 --> 08:50.488
the things have to do
anything we tell them.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.988
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's time for my sponge bath.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.432
Come along, retard.

08:55.468 --> 08:58.631
Beedie beedie beedie beedie.
Somebody kill me.

08:58.671 --> 09:01.765
And what of the other victims
in this unsolved crime...

09:01.807 --> 09:04.071
the family of the deceased?

09:04.110 --> 09:07.511
It's not so bad.
I got a new dad and everything.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.141
Time to go to your room, kid.

09:10.182 --> 09:13.174
Rey! Ret rour rands roff rer!

09:13.219 --> 09:14.709
I don't know what you said...

09:14.754 --> 09:18.315
but I'm pretty sure
it's something people get neutered for.

09:21.961 --> 09:25.488
The family hasn't seen much
of Judy Jetson recently.

09:25.531 --> 09:31.094
Dad's dead, and now I'm in this alley,
and I have no... aah!

09:31.137 --> 09:34.732
Aw, come on. Of course Rosie did it.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.572
Those three laws are full of crap,
you know?

09:37.610 --> 09:42.673
She was built to keep the place clean,
but he always kept it messy.

09:42.715 --> 09:46.116
She probably killed him to make sure
the place wouldn't get dirty.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.584
How do I know this?

09:49.622 --> 09:52.489
Because I, too, am a robot.

09:52.525 --> 09:56.256
Git git git git got git git

09:56.295 --> 09:58.422
Gaw ge-gaw ge-gaw

09:58.464 --> 10:00.261
Ge ge go-gaw ge

10:00.299 --> 10:02.164
Eee, erh, robot

10:02.201 --> 10:04.692
Who killed George Jetson?

10:04.737 --> 10:09.367
Big businessman gone bad?
That pissing dog?

10:09.408 --> 10:12.434
Or was it truly
the soulless metal housekeeper?

10:12.478 --> 10:15.538
I really didn't murder Mr. J., you know?

10:15.581 --> 10:17.879
Perhaps, but just to be safe...

10:21.954 --> 10:25.981
Next time on <i>Unsolved Case Files,</i> Jem.

10:26.025 --> 10:28.391
Was she truly outrageous?

10:28.427 --> 10:32.329
Truly, truly, truly outrageous?

10:51.517 --> 10:53.041
- Ba-gawk!
- Bock.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.251
Stupid monkey.
