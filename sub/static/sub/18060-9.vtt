NARRATOR: <i>Previously in </i>Wonderland...

00:04.671 --> 00:07.257
I've never met a human
quite like you, Alice.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.259
I've never met a genie quite like you.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.472
-No!
-Cyrus. He's alive.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.682
Once long ago, I got you back your heart.

00:15.766 --> 00:18.268
Now, you need to help me get back mine.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.687
What we want can't be accomplished

00:20.771 --> 00:23.315
until the girl's made all her wishes.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.859
-I love you, Anastasia.
-I love you, Will Scarlet.

00:25.943 --> 00:29.238
People of Wonderland,
I give you your Queen.

00:29.321 --> 00:31.114
(CROWD CHEERING)

00:31.198 --> 00:32.199
Anastasia.

00:35.494 --> 00:37.621
CYRUS: <i>Today's the day we get out of here.</i>

00:37.704 --> 00:39.706
<i>Stay strong, Alice. I'm coming for you.</i>

00:39.790 --> 00:42.709
All I have to do is follow the sun west,
and I'll find you.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.839
My name's Elizabeth.
But most people call me Lizard.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.383
<i>Will and I, we just ran together.</i>

00:49.466 --> 00:51.426
Sounds like you two were close friends.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.346
-Cyrus!
-Alice!

00:55.222 --> 00:56.473
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

00:56.557 --> 00:59.852
You see that storm coming?
That is Jafar, and he's coming for us.

00:59.935 --> 01:02.062
Why would he be after you?
You're his partner.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.730
Was his partner.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.649
Tell me why you made an alliance
with a madman.

01:05.732 --> 01:06.942
I wanted you.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.696
I want you back.

01:10.779 --> 01:11.947
Look out!

01:12.030 --> 01:13.782
(GRUNTS)

01:15.033 --> 01:16.201
What happened? Is he...

01:19.454 --> 01:20.789
I can save her!

01:20.873 --> 01:23.083
I wish to end Alice's suffering.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.168
(ENERGY WHOOSHING)

01:26.503 --> 01:27.963
My binds, they're gone.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.756
Alice, I'm free.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.050
Will, you're a genius.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.343
Where is he?

01:33.427 --> 01:34.720
He's gone.

01:34.803 --> 01:35.971
Where's the bottle?

01:36.054 --> 01:38.223
Ah, bloody hell.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.523
(GRUNTS)

01:52.321 --> 01:53.697
Bloody hell!

02:00.829 --> 02:01.830
Huh?

02:17.638 --> 02:18.639
(GASPS)

02:20.724 --> 02:23.769
-Lizard? Whoa!
-Will?

02:23.852 --> 02:25.312
I thought you were dead!

02:25.395 --> 02:26.813
I thought you were stone.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.608
What were you doing in there?

02:29.691 --> 02:33.695
Long story, involves magic.
Even if I understood it, which I don't,

02:33.779 --> 02:36.448
I definitely don't have time
to explain it.

02:36.532 --> 02:37.783
You're leaving?

02:37.866 --> 02:39.785
Last I saw, Alice and Cyrus
were in real trouble.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.245
I have to make sure they're safe.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.205
-You just got here.
-I know. We'll catch up later.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.915
-I've just got to...
-Will, wait!

02:50.170 --> 02:51.171
What just happened?

02:53.048 --> 02:54.049
Bloody hell.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.762
-I think these are for you.
-What are they?

02:58.846 --> 02:59.847
Wishes.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.850
Mistress mine, my will is thine.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.309
Tell me your wishes three.

03:05.686 --> 03:06.687
Bollocks!

03:07.563 --> 03:09.398
I'm pretty sure I'm a genie, Lizard.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.404
And I'm your master.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.410
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

03:41.722 --> 03:42.723
Alice.

03:44.266 --> 03:45.267
Cyrus?

03:48.395 --> 03:50.814
I can hardly tell what's real
and what's a dream.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.066
You were in a deep sleep.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.110
But I promise, you're very much awake.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.992
See? Totally real.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.208
We're together.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.084
We did it.

04:11.543 --> 04:12.711
You did it, Alice.

04:16.215 --> 04:20.052
Ugh. You two are even more insufferable
together. Do you know that?

04:20.135 --> 04:22.471
-What are you doing here?
-Alice, wait!

04:22.554 --> 04:25.224
-Don't threaten me, darling.
-Enough!

04:25.307 --> 04:27.935
Now, we can work together,
or we can perish together.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.229
Why on earth would we work with her?

04:30.312 --> 04:31.897
She doesn't remember.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.565
Or maybe she just doesn't care.

04:33.649 --> 04:35.901
What are you two talking about?

04:35.984 --> 04:38.737
Wait, why are you two even talking at all?

04:38.820 --> 04:41.114
The Knave. We have to save him.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.659
Why do we need to save him?

04:43.742 --> 04:45.953
Same old Alice,
only thinking about herself.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.914
One more word, and I'll let her
give you what you deserve.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.879
The wish you gave to the Knave,
he used it to end your suffering.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.091
And as a result,
he not only saved your life,

04:59.174 --> 05:00.884
he granted me my freedom.

05:00.968 --> 05:04.471
Unfortunately, as you know,
magic always comes at a price.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.643
And a bottle always
has to have a genie inside.

05:09.726 --> 05:10.853
Oh, no.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.354
So Will, he's...

05:12.437 --> 05:13.689
I'm afraid so.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.233
That's why we can't leave Wonderland.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.568
Not yet.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.902
We have to save him.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.737
"We" don't have to do anything.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.324
-You're not seriously considering...
-Alice.

05:24.408 --> 05:26.285
If there's one thing I know
from being a genie,

05:26.368 --> 05:28.328
it's what people wish for
in their heart of hearts.

05:28.412 --> 05:31.623
And I am telling you, the Queen wants
the same thing as you do,

05:31.707 --> 05:33.542
to be with the one she loves.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.127
To be with Will.

05:36.545 --> 05:39.548
Besides, if you want to find him
before Jafar does,

05:39.631 --> 05:41.592
you need all the help you can get.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.094
And having a little bit
of magic on our side

05:44.178 --> 05:45.637
might prove to be useful.

05:50.434 --> 05:52.895
(SIGHS) Very well, then.

05:54.146 --> 05:56.064
We find the bottle, we save the Knave.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.985
And then get the hell out of Wonderland.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.699
The Red Queen's reign is over!

06:05.782 --> 06:07.826
I'm the master of Wonderland now.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.499
Enjoying the view, Father?

06:15.334 --> 06:18.879
Now you can watch me sit on the throne
you didn't believe I deserved.

06:18.962 --> 06:22.674
A throne is made when the man
who sits upon it is worthy.

06:22.758 --> 06:28.347
Where you sit, Jafar, is nothing
more than a large chair.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.434
And you, Father?

06:32.518 --> 06:34.686
Do you believe you were worthy?

06:34.770 --> 06:36.063
More so than you.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.525
You tried to murder your own son.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.282
If only I had succeeded,

06:48.867 --> 06:51.703
the world would be a far better place.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.087
Remove him!

07:15.060 --> 07:16.228
Jafar.

07:17.229 --> 07:20.732
Or should I say, Your Majesty?

07:21.358 --> 07:22.359
You're back.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.865
(SIGHS) You'd better have some good news.

07:27.948 --> 07:31.243
My men spent all night searching,
but no luck.

07:31.326 --> 07:34.746
They'll head out again
after they get some rest.

07:34.830 --> 07:35.831
Rest?

07:37.165 --> 07:39.251
The third wish has been made.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.295
The genie is back in his bottle.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.797
Get more men.
Raise an army if you have to!

07:43.881 --> 07:46.508
I need that bottle now,
before someone else finds it.

07:46.592 --> 07:49.511
I've tried, but word's gotten out.

07:49.595 --> 07:52.181
Working for you tends to

07:52.264 --> 07:55.475
shorten one's life expectancy.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.269
So does failing me.

07:57.728 --> 08:00.147
And you have failed spectacularly.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.108
Wait.

08:03.192 --> 08:07.863
There might be one way
to get what you want.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.198
Tell me.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.450
There's an ancient creature,

08:11.533 --> 08:14.912
imprisoned for one hundred years.

08:14.995 --> 08:18.582
Most are afraid to even speak its name

08:18.665 --> 08:21.752
for fear it might return.

08:21.835 --> 08:22.836
Go on.

08:23.378 --> 08:27.549
It's more powerful than any army.

08:27.633 --> 08:30.177
And once you tell it what you want,

08:30.260 --> 08:34.139
nothing, no one can stop it.

08:34.223 --> 08:36.725
But I beg you not to...

08:36.808 --> 08:38.435
-I need a name.
-(GROANS)

08:39.645 --> 08:41.647
It is called

08:41.730 --> 08:43.565
the Jabberwocky.

08:48.237 --> 08:51.198
So, if the bottle rolled down this hill.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.033
It most likely ended up here.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.409
CYRUS: In the river.

08:55.953 --> 08:58.163
Must we walk directly in the mud?

08:58.247 --> 08:59.873
What's the matter, Queen?

08:59.957 --> 09:02.709
Or is it only your hands
you don't mind getting dirty?

09:02.793 --> 09:05.546
Cyrus, you should really teach
your girlfriend some manners

09:05.629 --> 09:06.964
before someone else does.

09:08.382 --> 09:11.844
Chances are the bottle carried downstream.

09:11.927 --> 09:14.555
If we keep to the path of the river,
we'll find Will.

09:23.522 --> 09:24.940
Alice, are you all right?

09:25.023 --> 09:26.483
-Yes. I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

09:27.568 --> 09:29.695
-Of course I am.
-Yeah.

09:30.404 --> 09:33.824
I can't even begin to imagine
what you went through to get back here.

09:34.825 --> 09:36.451
How did you get back here?

09:36.535 --> 09:38.662
Rabbit and the Knave came and got me out.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.414
Out? From where?

09:42.040 --> 09:43.166
From England.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.461
They told me you were alive
and they brought me back to find you.

09:46.545 --> 09:49.298
But what about you?

09:49.381 --> 09:51.592
How long were you in Jafar's prison?

09:51.675 --> 09:53.635
I can only imagine how horrible it was.

09:57.514 --> 10:01.101
-We just have some catching up to do.
-We just need to talk. That's all.

10:01.185 --> 10:04.188
We won't always be in such close
quarters with the Red Queen.

10:04.271 --> 10:07.149
-We'll find time to be together.
-I know.

10:07.232 --> 10:11.570
It's just... (SIGHS) She's so devious.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.451
Cyrus?

10:17.534 --> 10:19.119
-What?
-Where is she?

10:19.786 --> 10:21.705
I don't know. She was right behind us.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.624
I can't believe I fell for it again.

10:23.707 --> 10:25.709
-Alice, we don't know...
-Yes, we do.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.337
-A tiger doesn't change its stripes.
-All right.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.756
So, what's her plan.
Off to find the Knave on her own?

10:30.839 --> 10:31.840
Undoubtedly.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.843
The more important question is why?

10:36.178 --> 10:38.680
Why risk your life
going back for Alice and Cyrus?

10:38.764 --> 10:42.768
I mean, you promised you'd help them get
back together, and now they're together.

10:42.851 --> 10:46.396
For all you know, they already
hightailed it out of Wonderland.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.440
You've got a point there.

10:48.524 --> 10:51.068
I'm just saying,
you've been through a lot,

10:51.151 --> 10:53.028
fulfilled all your obligations.

10:53.111 --> 10:56.323
Don't you think you deserve
a little "Knave time"?

10:57.616 --> 11:01.036
Well, I could use a chance
to catch me breath.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.459
How about this?
You grant me my first wish,

11:07.543 --> 11:10.295
and then you can run off,
do whatever you want.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.925
Fair enough.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.301
Okay.

11:16.385 --> 11:17.386
Let's see.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.556
-I wish...
-Wait! Be careful!

11:20.639 --> 11:23.851
There's rules to this genie business.
Very, very important rules.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.018
Like what?

11:25.102 --> 11:27.396
Like rules I'm trying
bloody hard to remember.

11:27.479 --> 11:28.772
Uh, right.

11:29.565 --> 11:30.941
I'm not allowed...

11:31.567 --> 11:33.318
(SIGHS) I can't...

11:34.945 --> 11:36.613
Something about...

11:36.697 --> 11:37.865
Here we go.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.575
I can't make anyone fall in love.

11:42.244 --> 11:44.913
Oh. Well, um... Okay.

11:44.997 --> 11:46.373
How about this instead?

11:46.456 --> 11:49.293
You tell me something you want,
and I'll wish it for you.

11:50.419 --> 11:51.503
You serious?

11:51.587 --> 11:54.131
Sure. For old times' sake.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.675
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.305
Well, I don't want it to be too big.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.390
There's consequences in that.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.058
But something small,

12:05.142 --> 12:07.728
something safe, something like...

12:09.438 --> 12:10.647
A beer.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.399
An ice-cold beer.

12:12.482 --> 12:15.360
Even better,
beers for everyone in the village!

12:15.444 --> 12:16.570
(ALL CHEERING)

12:18.030 --> 12:19.406
One diamond pin!

12:19.489 --> 12:21.033
(ALL CHEERING)

12:21.116 --> 12:24.036
One ring, looks like rubies!

12:25.871 --> 12:27.456
This'll feed us for months.

12:28.290 --> 12:33.170
The question is, what do we do with her?

12:36.256 --> 12:37.674
Where am I?

12:39.218 --> 12:41.345
Who are you people?

12:41.428 --> 12:42.429
You people?

12:43.597 --> 12:45.807
Did you hear that? "You people."

12:45.891 --> 12:47.476
(MEN CHUCKLING)

12:48.352 --> 12:50.437

or, rather, who you used to be

12:57.110 --> 13:00.739
before Jafar threw you
out of your fancy silver palace.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.866
He didn't throw me out of the palace.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.536
-I abandoned it!
-Just like you abandoned us!

take over our fields.

(GASPS) Oh, thank you, Sire.

14:03.969 --> 14:05.512
That is much more comfortable.

14:05.596 --> 14:07.931
Now tell me where
I can find the Jabberwocky.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.142
The Jabberwo... Wo... Why? What... What...

14:10.225 --> 14:12.644
I ask the questions, Tweedle.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.396
Show me where to find it.

14:14.479 --> 14:17.357
I would be more than happy to help.

14:17.441 --> 14:20.110
But with me not having a body,

14:20.194 --> 14:22.446
I'm afraid it's just not possible, is it?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.412
Anything is possible, Tweedle.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.496
Hmm.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.502
Would you like to be able to walk again?

14:36.585 --> 14:38.170
Of course.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.379
Then help me.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.382
And I'll help you.

It took 500 men
and Wonderland's most powerful magic

14:47.638 --> 14:49.348
to imprison the Jabberwocky.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.558
I must beg you, Sire,

14:51.642 --> 14:55.521
as your humble servant, do not do this.

14:55.604 --> 14:58.357
Yet it's precisely your fear,

14:58.440 --> 15:01.527
your willingness to do anything
to avoid facing it,

15:01.610 --> 15:03.946
that I find so intriguing
about this creature.

15:06.031 --> 15:11.245
You see, there's something
in Wonderland that I want.

15:11.328 --> 15:12.329
A genie.

15:13.705 --> 15:17.459
And, quite honestly,
I've grown tired of hunting for him.

15:17.543 --> 15:20.462
But perhaps with this creature at my side,

15:20.546 --> 15:23.465
with the threat of releasing it,

15:23.549 --> 15:25.926
I won't have to hunt any longer.

15:26.677 --> 15:30.305
Because all of Wonderland will be
falling over itself to bring him to me.

These people love me.
Couldn't have done it without you, Lizard.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.107
Now what are we gonna wish for next?

16:22.191 --> 16:23.859
Well, I thought you said
we had to be careful.

16:23.942 --> 16:25.903
We are being careful!
Do you see any consequences?

16:25.986 --> 16:28.238
I don't see any consequences.

I'm sure I'll have
a hangover in the morning,

16:30.073 --> 16:32.159
but I don't think that has
anything to do with the wish.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.411
Now we've got to come up
with something that you want.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.414
I'm working on it.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.498
Great.

16:39.458 --> 16:42.336
I have no idea what Cyrus
was complaining about.

We shouldn't be looking for the Red Queen.

16:47.257 --> 16:50.177
We should be looking for the Knave.
He's the one in danger.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.804
The sooner we find him,
the sooner we can leave Wonderland

16:52.888 --> 16:54.056
and start our life together.

16:54.139 --> 16:55.557
What if something's happened to her?

16:55.641 --> 16:56.808
The only thing that's happened

16:56.892 --> 16:59.228
is she's gone off
to get the bottle on her own.

17:00.979 --> 17:03.982

18:07.880 --> 18:10.883
I'm not. It's a simple location spell.
Anyone could learn it.

18:10.966 --> 18:12.926
-Who taught you?
-My mother.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.845
She taught all of us.

27:06.168 --> 27:09.505
If you hadn't sacrificed that necklace,
we'd all be dead right now.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.508
It shouldn't matter.
It's just an object, nothing more.

This just... It isn't how
I saw our first day together.

27:17.930 --> 27:19.681
I went through hell to find you,

27:19.765 --> 27:22.434
and there were days I thought
I'd never see you again.

27:22.518 --> 27:24.436
And now that we're finally together...

27:25.312 --> 27:26.313

27:27.856 --> 27:28.982
I'm afraid.

What are you afraid of, Alice?

27:31.985 --> 27:34.655
I'm afraid that the battles
will never end.

27:34.738 --> 27:37.199
I'm afraid there will always be
one more mission,

27:37.282 --> 27:40.953
one more thing preventing us
from being alone together,

27:41.036 --> 27:43.372

I know how hard it was for you
to part with the necklace.

30:53.187 --> 30:55.772
But that was a symbol of our past.

let you make your speech.
