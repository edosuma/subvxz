moving again?

18:43.740 --> 18:45.330
Ask your crazy husband.

18:45.370 --> 18:47.330
It took me a year and a half
to finish Park Avenue,

18:47.370 --> 18:49.370
and now he wants
to start over.

18:49.410 --> 18:51.670
But it's the penthouse.

18:51.710 --> 18:53.920
Oh! Come see the terrace.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.470
-So?
-It's pretty.

19:00.970 --> 19:02.890
You don't seem
that excited.

19:02.930 --> 19:04.100
What's wrong?

19:04.140 --> 19:05.720
I thought you lived
for this stuff.

19:05.760 --> 19:06.930
I do.

19:06.970 --> 19:09.850
I'm just tired.

19:09.890 --> 19:11.480
Andrew came home
late last night.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.440
You're skinny
and you're having sex?

19:13.480 --> 19:15.150
No, we didn't.

19:15.190 --> 19:18.110
The last time I saw Henry
naked was right before

19:18.150 --> 19:20.900
the twins turned three,
last year.

19:23.410 --> 19:26.330
I think Henry's having
an affair.

19:26.370 --> 19:27.870
I can't stand
to look at him,

19:27.910 --> 19:30.370
let alone sleep
next to him.

19:30.410 --> 19:31.960
Oh, I could so use you
and a martini.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.580
Say you'll go out with me
tonight.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.170
I would love to.

19:35.210 --> 19:36.800
Oh, no, wait.
Don't you have that thing?

19:36.840 --> 19:38.010
What thing?

19:38.050 --> 19:39.880
That fund-raising thing?

19:39.920 --> 19:42.090
Yes! I totally forgot.

19:42.130 --> 19:43.590
I'll be fine.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.180
I'll just hook up
with one of the workmen.

19:46.220 --> 19:47.810
I'm sure contractors
make more money

19:47.850 --> 19:49.560
than out-of-work novelists.

19:51.810 --> 19:54.190
[woman singing aria]

20:30.310 --> 20:32.270
[aria ends, applause]

20:34.650 --> 20:36.310
-Hey, Jim.
-Andrew.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.520
Hey, you know,
it's been years

20:37.560 --> 20:39.400
since you've worn
that dress.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.610
Is it too much?

20:40.650 --> 20:42.900
No, it's absolutely
perfect.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.570
Now, a glass
of champagne?

20:45.610 --> 20:47.280
Actually, could you make
mine water?

20:47.320 --> 20:48.780
I have a little bit
of a headache.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.200
Absolutely.

21:31.030 --> 21:32.200
[gasps]

21:40.090 --> 21:41.800
What the hell
are you doing?!

21:41.840 --> 21:44.210
I just wanted to show you
how much I missed you.

21:44.260 --> 21:46.680
Gemma said you were
gonna be here tonight.

21:46.720 --> 21:48.550
Henry?

21:48.590 --> 21:50.890
Relax. Andrew
can't see us.

21:50.930 --> 21:52.430
This is too much.

21:52.470 --> 21:54.020
No, what's too much is

21:54.060 --> 21:55.980
I haven't seen you
in a week.

21:56.020 --> 21:57.480
So you got detained
in the Hamptons. Fine.

21:57.520 --> 21:58.810
But then when
you didn't

21:58.850 --> 22:00.520
show up at the hotel,
I went to your place,

22:00.560 --> 22:02.520
and you just stared
at me from the balcony

22:02.570 --> 22:04.110
like I was some kind
of crazy person.

22:04.150 --> 22:06.490
And now this.

22:06.530 --> 22:08.110
I have to go.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.990
No, no.

22:10.030 --> 22:11.780
Not until you tell me
what's going on.

22:11.830 --> 22:12.990
We can't do this here.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.200
Andrew's waiting
for me.

22:14.240 --> 22:15.700
Like you care.
Let him wait.

22:15.750 --> 22:17.540
Henry, please.

22:17.580 --> 22:20.130
Fine. Meet me at
the hotel on Thursday.

22:20.170 --> 22:22.670
The nanny is taking the boys
to the park at noon.

22:22.710 --> 22:25.550
Um, uh, noon.

22:25.590 --> 22:28.510
I could be late. Traffic
from the new apartment.

22:28.550 --> 22:30.970
The apartment is two minutes
away from the Dandridge.

22:34.430 --> 22:36.810
You're making me
nervous, Siobhan.

22:36.850 --> 22:38.690
You won't even
look at me.

22:41.100 --> 22:45.360
Hey, I want to see you.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.610
OK.

22:47.650 --> 22:48.820
I'll meet you there.

22:50.610 --> 22:52.160
Nothing has changed
on my end.

22:59.830 --> 23:01.880
My hook is stuck.
Do you mind?

23:12.220 --> 23:13.800
Everything OK?

23:13.850 --> 23:15.010
Fine.

23:18.730 --> 23:21.400
It's just...I thought...

23:21.440 --> 23:22.940
You thought what?

23:25.020 --> 23:29.110
I don't know,
that we were cool?

23:29.150 --> 23:30.860
Cool? What are we, 12?

23:32.740 --> 23:34.910
Of course we're not cool.

23:36.450 --> 23:39.410
But tonight at the gala,

23:39.450 --> 23:42.420
you--you seemed
so happy.

23:42.460 --> 23:44.210
That was an act.

23:44.250 --> 23:45.790
This is your game,
Siobhan.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.630
I'm just playing
by the rules.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.930
What if I don't want
to play games anymore?

23:51.970 --> 23:54.640
Well, that would be a first.

23:54.680 --> 23:55.890
I'm serious.

23:59.220 --> 24:04.600
Why can't we just be nice
to each other, for real?

24:04.650 --> 24:06.230
Who are you?

24:08.780 --> 24:11.450
What do you mean?

24:11.490 --> 24:14.450
You're just so different.

24:14.490 --> 24:16.620
Just relaxed
and agreeable.

24:16.660 --> 24:18.200
And you don't like it?

24:18.240 --> 24:20.540
No.

24:20.580 --> 24:22.830
I love it.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.670
I just don't believe it.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.330
[sniffles]

25:07.920 --> 25:10.170
[heavy sigh]

25:10.210 --> 25:12.840
Mistakes aren't tragedies.

25:12.880 --> 25:14.630
But please, Higher Power...

25:14.670 --> 25:16.340
GROUP:
...help me learn from them.

25:18.930 --> 25:23.060
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do,

25:23.100 --> 25:27.520
but right now, it's
the only choice that I have.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.730
WOMAN: Sobriety is
the only choice.

25:32.570 --> 25:34.820
I feel like every time
I clean up a mess,

25:34.860 --> 25:37.530
I end up dirty.

25:37.570 --> 25:39.410
[sniffles]

25:39.450 --> 25:41.540
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

25:42.950 --> 25:45.000
It just did.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.460
The important
thing is

25:46.500 --> 25:49.210
for you to take responsibility
for your actions.

25:50.960 --> 25:54.420
In all this,

25:54.460 --> 25:56.930
I lost someone
who meant everything to me.

25:58.590 --> 26:00.550
I just got her back.

26:02.810 --> 26:05.520
Now she's gone.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.190
[sniffles]

26:07.230 --> 26:12.150
Maybe once things settle down,
I can go back to my old life,

26:12.190 --> 26:14.530
be normal again.

26:17.030 --> 26:18.570
But for now...

26:18.610 --> 26:20.990
[rock music playing]

26:21.030 --> 26:22.990
[man and woman
laughing]

26:25.250 --> 26:26.410
Andrew?

26:26.450 --> 26:27.620
[woman laughing]

26:38.840 --> 26:40.840
Juliet?

26:40.890 --> 26:43.140
What the hell, Siobhan!
Don't you knock?!

26:43.180 --> 26:44.810
What's going on?

26:44.850 --> 26:47.180
Wait. Is that my scarf?

26:47.230 --> 26:48.770
Send me the dry cleaning bill.

26:48.810 --> 26:50.020
Did you go through
my drawers?

26:50.060 --> 26:51.860
Will you just leave already?

27:01.660 --> 27:03.280
I'll text you.

27:05.370 --> 27:07.410
-Thanks a lot, Siobhan.
-I'm sorry.

27:07.450 --> 27:09.000
I didn't know you
were coming home.

27:09.040 --> 27:11.210
It's my house. I can
stop by any time I want.

27:14.040 --> 27:17.920
Of course you can. I just...
I wasn't expecting you.

27:17.960 --> 27:20.470
I shouldn't have to be
at boarding school anyway.

27:20.510 --> 27:22.340
The only reason that Daddy
sent me was because of you.

27:22.390 --> 27:24.180
Juliet, I'm not trying
to start a fight.

27:24.220 --> 27:25.390
Since when?

27:25.430 --> 27:26.850
[phone ringing]

27:30.890 --> 27:32.770
Hello?

27:32.810 --> 27:34.400
Yeah, whatever.

27:34.440 --> 27:36.820
Some guy is coming up
to see you.

27:36.860 --> 27:38.780
Who?

27:38.820 --> 27:40.150
Juliet, did they say who?

27:40.200 --> 27:41.570
[sighs]

28:00.920 --> 28:02.930
Wow. Heh heh!

28:02.970 --> 28:04.640
Far cry from Wyoming.

28:04.680 --> 28:06.260
You ever been?

28:08.060 --> 28:11.270
My name's Victor Machado.
I'm with the FBI.

28:14.310 --> 28:15.900
Siobhan Martin.

28:15.940 --> 28:17.520
How can I help you?

28:17.570 --> 28:19.030
I'm here to talk to you
about your sister.

28:19.070 --> 28:20.990
Can I buy you
a cup of coffee?

28:23.950 --> 28:27.160
So you really have no idea
where your sister is?

28:27.200 --> 28:29.330
Not a clue.

28:29.370 --> 28:30.870
Well, then I'm guessing

28:30.910 --> 28:33.160
you don't know what kind
of trouble she's in.

28:33.210 --> 28:34.920
Well, I assume you didn't
come all the way out here

28:34.960 --> 28:36.500
because she was jaywalking.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.920
[chuckles]

28:38.960 --> 28:40.460
That's amazing.

28:40.510 --> 28:42.300
The same pretty face,

28:42.340 --> 28:45.260
the same sarcastic
attitude.

28:45.300 --> 28:46.890
I'm sorry.

28:46.930 --> 28:49.310
I'm just not exactly sure
what this has to do with me.

28:49.350 --> 28:52.230
My sister and I
are not close.

28:52.270 --> 28:54.520
We haven't spoken
in years.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.770
Bridget's a fugitive.

28:56.810 --> 28:58.730
She assaulted
a police officer,

28:58.770 --> 29:01.110
and she stole his weapon.

29:01.150 --> 29:03.030
Bridget wouldn't
do that.

29:03.070 --> 29:05.410
You sound pretty confident,
and yet you're not close.

29:06.490 --> 29:08.320
We're twins.

29:11.790 --> 29:15.790
Bridget was the only
eyewitness to a murder.

29:15.830 --> 29:19.420
She'd been arrested for
prostitution and possession.

29:19.460 --> 29:21.840
We agreed to drop those
charges if she'd testify.

29:21.880 --> 29:25.300
But that never happened.

29:25.340 --> 29:28.470
We're very concerned
for her safety.

29:28.510 --> 29:30.350
If she didn't talk, why
are you so concerned?

29:30.390 --> 29:31.970
Because the man she was
supposed to testify against

29:32.020 --> 29:33.770
is now free,

29:33.810 --> 29:36.770
and he's gonna make sure he
doesn't go back to prison.

29:36.810 --> 29:41.360
Silencing your sister
is his only insurance.

29:41.400 --> 29:43.280
Mrs. Martin,
if you know something,

29:43.320 --> 29:44.530
anything, you need to tell me.

29:44.570 --> 29:46.570
She's facing arrest.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.870
Or worse.

29:48.910 --> 29:50.490
The bottom line--

29:50.530 --> 29:52.290
she's not going
to get far either way.

30:52.970 --> 30:54.140
Siobhan?

30:54.180 --> 30:55.930
[gasps]

30:55.970 --> 30:58.350
I--you scared me.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.020
What are you doing here?

31:00.060 --> 31:02.400
I thought I would
check on the progress.

31:02.440 --> 31:04.270
At 9:00?

31:04.320 --> 31:06.070
I was in the area.

31:08.490 --> 31:09.650
Huh.

31:09.700 --> 31:11.160
Well, I was going
to surprise you,

31:11.200 --> 31:13.240
but since you're
already here,

31:13.280 --> 31:15.160
won't this look amazing

31:15.200 --> 31:19.040
on that wall over a black
lacquered console table?

31:19.080 --> 31:20.870
Don't worry. Those holes
will be covered by tomorrow.

31:22.920 --> 31:25.000
Perfect.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.710
You know, if it weren't
for this pain-in-the-ass

31:26.750 --> 31:29.090
renovation, I'd be obsessing

31:29.130 --> 31:30.840
over who Henry's
having an affair with.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.390
Why else do you
think I'm here

31:32.430 --> 31:34.600
at 9:00 at night?

31:34.640 --> 31:37.020
At least you have a
sense of humor about it.

31:37.060 --> 31:38.810
Hmm.

31:38.850 --> 31:40.810
Do you have any idea
who it might be?

31:40.850 --> 31:42.980
Well, I went through
the list of usual suspects,

31:43.020 --> 31:45.110
but the trainer's gay,

31:45.150 --> 31:47.320
the maid's fat,

31:47.360 --> 31:49.690
the wife's best friend...

31:52.320 --> 31:54.700
I'm joking!

31:54.740 --> 31:57.160
Come on. You're
so not his type.

31:57.200 --> 31:58.450
[nervous chuckle]

31:58.490 --> 32:00.910
[knock on door]

32:00.960 --> 32:02.580
I'm not here to
sleep with you.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.080
Why? I'm here
to sleep with you.

32:04.130 --> 32:05.710
Henry, you're my
best friend's husband.

32:05.750 --> 32:07.300
OK. That never
bothered you before.

32:07.340 --> 32:09.800
Well, it does now.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.010
I don't get it.

32:12.050 --> 32:14.300
What is it, Siobhan?

32:14.340 --> 32:16.930
Gemma's on to us.

32:16.970 --> 32:18.350
She told me that she thinks
you're cheating on her.

32:18.390 --> 32:20.220
With whom?

32:20.270 --> 32:21.430
I suggested the nanny.

32:21.480 --> 32:23.270
Annafried's
a lesbian.

32:23.310 --> 32:24.600
Yeah, well, I really
couldn't think

32:24.650 --> 32:25.860
of what else to say
at the moment.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.070
How about,
Henry is a great guy,

32:27.110 --> 32:28.440
and he would
never cheat on you?

32:28.480 --> 32:29.980
We just need to
lay low for a while.

32:30.030 --> 32:33.150
-I've been trying to lay low.
-I'm serious.

32:33.200 --> 32:37.740
If you really love me,
you'll stay away.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.120
ANDREW:
This is the third time.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.630
I keep letting you get away
with this crap, but I'm done.

32:45.670 --> 32:47.540
Daddy, please. You don't
know what happened.

32:47.590 --> 32:51.510
No. You could
have gone to jail.

32:51.550 --> 32:53.760
And did you ever stop
to think for one second

32:53.800 --> 32:55.340
how your behavior is
affecting this family?

32:55.390 --> 32:57.260
What family?

32:57.300 --> 32:58.760
Siobhan hates me,

32:58.810 --> 33:01.470
and you're never around.

33:01.520 --> 33:04.190
I'm going to Mom's.

33:04.230 --> 33:05.980
You know that's
not an option.

33:07.940 --> 33:09.610
Great, Daddy.

33:09.650 --> 33:11.360
Just throw it in my face

33:11.400 --> 33:13.030
that she doesn't
want me either.

33:13.070 --> 33:14.820
Juliet, that's not
what I meant.

33:14.860 --> 33:16.860
Juliet.

33:18.410 --> 33:20.790
What's going on?

33:20.830 --> 33:22.370
Nothing.

33:22.410 --> 33:24.370
[cell phone ringing]

33:30.380 --> 33:31.920
Hello?

33:31.960 --> 33:33.760
Mrs. Martin,
this is Dr. Marx.

33:33.800 --> 33:35.470
I'm sorry to call so late,
but you didn't show up

33:35.510 --> 33:38.260
for your appointment
this afternoon.

33:38.300 --> 33:40.050
I'm sorry.

33:40.100 --> 33:42.520
I, um, I must've forgotten
to write it in my book.

33:42.560 --> 33:44.390
Well, reschedule
when you can,

33:44.430 --> 33:47.020
because your blood work
came back positive.

33:48.650 --> 33:50.650
Oh, is that a bad thing?

33:50.690 --> 33:52.690
No, no.
It's a great thing.

33:52.730 --> 33:54.240
Congratulations.

33:54.280 --> 33:57.360
You're about
four weeks along.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.820
I-I'm pregnant?

34:10.590 --> 34:12.800
Siobhan, what did you do?

34:23.310 --> 34:24.560
GEMMA: Pregnant?

34:24.600 --> 34:26.640
You sneaky bitch!

34:26.680 --> 34:29.850
So that's why
you haven't been drinking.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.860
-Isn't that great, Henry?
-It's great.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.780
Oh, he's just upset
'cause his editor

34:33.820 --> 34:35.320
doesn't like
his new pages.

34:35.360 --> 34:36.610
HENRY:
Thank you for sharing that.

34:36.650 --> 34:38.150
What? Don't let
your bad mood

34:38.200 --> 34:39.860
get in the way of
their good news.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.450
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

34:44.490 --> 34:46.620
ANDREW:
We're both very happy.

34:46.660 --> 34:48.620
Well, I could use a refill.

34:48.660 --> 34:51.920
-Henry.
-Uh, no, thanks.

34:51.960 --> 34:53.290
Step this way.
I'm buying.

35:03.470 --> 35:06.390
I'm sorry. I didn't want
it to come out that way.

35:06.430 --> 35:07.730
You know
that's my baby.

35:07.770 --> 35:09.480
-No, I don't.
-Oh, come on, Siobhan.

35:09.520 --> 35:10.690
We've slept together
a thousand times,

35:10.730 --> 35:12.270
and you've thrown
Andrew a bone,

35:12.310 --> 35:13.860
what, once, twice in
the past few months?

35:13.900 --> 35:15.400
That is my kid.

35:15.440 --> 35:16.900
And I'm not just
going to smile

35:16.940 --> 35:18.820
and pretend to be
happy for Andrew.

35:18.860 --> 35:20.070
-What do you want me to do?
-Leave him.

35:20.110 --> 35:21.700
I can't.

35:21.740 --> 35:23.700
If you don't leave
him, we're over.

35:23.740 --> 35:25.030
Make a choice.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.660
Him or me.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.580
I choose him.

35:40.550 --> 35:43.010
ANDREW: Look,
I know we negotiated that.

35:43.050 --> 35:45.890
But I want out.

35:45.930 --> 35:47.520
Look, the, uh, wife
just walked in.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.310
We'll finish
this later.

35:51.640 --> 35:54.150
Do you think Henry was
acting strange last night?

35:54.190 --> 35:56.650
You know
those artist types.

35:56.690 --> 35:58.320
They're temperamental.

36:01.780 --> 36:03.530
What about Juliet?

36:03.570 --> 36:05.070
I mean, she seemed
pretty upset.

36:05.120 --> 36:06.740
You both did.

36:08.870 --> 36:11.500
She got kicked out
of boarding school.

36:11.540 --> 36:13.080
For what?

36:19.840 --> 36:21.340
You're kidding me.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.380
Tell me about it.

36:23.430 --> 36:27.350
Well, she can't stay here.

36:27.390 --> 36:29.350
Not with the baby coming.

36:29.390 --> 36:30.560
Come on, Siobh.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.390
She's got nowhere
else to go.

36:35.150 --> 36:37.150
Hey, Miller.

36:37.190 --> 36:38.570
So you found them

36:38.610 --> 36:39.780
breaking into the
bus station lockers?

36:39.820 --> 36:41.440
Four kids, easy target.

36:41.490 --> 36:44.860
Didn't think much of it,
till we found this.

36:44.910 --> 36:47.030
Looks like your girl's
been here.

36:47.070 --> 36:51.000
Her sister Siobhan said
they hadn't spoken in years.

36:51.040 --> 36:52.790
Wonder what else
she's lying about.

36:52.830 --> 36:54.540
[police radio transmissions]

36:57.080 --> 36:58.790
[cell phone beeps]

37:01.590 --> 37:03.510
GEMMA: It's Gemma.

37:03.550 --> 37:05.050
Meet me at the
loft in an hour.

37:05.090 --> 37:07.010
I think I know who Henry's
having an affair with.

37:12.850 --> 37:14.440
Gemma?

37:19.110 --> 37:21.230
Gemma?

37:28.120 --> 37:29.450
Gemma?

37:39.920 --> 37:41.250
Gemma?

38:17.330 --> 38:19.670
[country music playing]

38:40.150 --> 38:42.110
[grunting]

38:47.740 --> 38:49.820
You have the wrong girl!

39:05.670 --> 39:07.340
[panting]

39:12.600 --> 39:13.970
[groaning]

39:14.010 --> 39:15.560
I'm not Bridget.

39:42.210 --> 39:43.460
Siobhan.

39:47.170 --> 39:49.130
[phone ringing]

39:50.970 --> 39:52.930
[continues ringing]

40:01.730 --> 40:02.900
Hello?

40:02.940 --> 40:05.610
MAN: Siobhan,
we have a problem.
