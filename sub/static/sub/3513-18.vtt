WEBVTT

00:11.878 --> 00:17.885
The Klaustreich I
came in contact with

00:18.752 --> 00:21.323
was aggressive.

00:25.392 --> 00:27.030
Predatory.

00:28.161 --> 00:29.401
And...

00:34.434 --> 00:37.438
A real ass. I can't write that.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.078
What's the word?

00:40.974 --> 00:42.385
Mean? No.

00:43.143 --> 00:45.123
Catty? Big no.

00:46.613 --> 00:47.921
Got it.

00:49.449 --> 00:52.293
Sadistic and treacherous.

01:35.562 --> 01:37.200
And what time does that leave?

01:37.263 --> 01:39.675
That's to Portland, bus 414.

01:39.732 --> 01:41.712
Let me get a departure
schedule for you.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.988
Thank you for calling RAZ bus line.

04:15.288 --> 04:16.665
Yes, I understand.

04:19.659 --> 04:22.435
One can't be too careful
entering the home of a

04:22.495 --> 04:26.238
police captain before
introductions are made, you know?

04:28.001 --> 04:29.002
So true.

04:31.070 --> 04:34.142
I was just, uh, following protocol.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.946
I don't care if you are
working for the Verrat.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.286
The next time you let yourself
into my home uninvited,

04:39.345 --> 04:40.983
I will shoot you.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.923
In self-defense, of course.

04:44.984 --> 04:47.396
My dear Captain,
if you didn't speak German,

04:47.453 --> 04:48.761
you'd be dead by now.

04:48.821 --> 04:50.630
But, uh, may I introduce myself?

04:51.824 --> 04:53.064
My name is Edgar Waltz.

04:56.863 --> 04:58.934
Who are you hunting?
His name is Ian Harmon.

04:59.465 --> 05:00.466
What's he done?

05:00.533 --> 05:02.308
He's a leader of the Resistance.

05:03.436 --> 05:04.710
One of the few still alive.

05:04.771 --> 05:06.182
But what's he done here,
in Portland?

05:06.239 --> 05:07.877
I don't know, and I don't care.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.817
Time is of the essence,
and I need to find him.

05:10.176 --> 05:14.249
We believe the Resistance has
established a presence here

05:14.314 --> 05:17.056
to harbor fugitives and
make them disappear.

05:17.684 --> 05:20.460
The Verrat's problems with the
Resistance are not my problems.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.590
Well, maybe your past is not
as far away as you think.

05:25.024 --> 05:27.197
The Verrat does not
make decisions for me.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.433
The High Command will
not be happy about that.

05:29.495 --> 05:30.496
I'm not concerned.

05:30.563 --> 05:32.668
It would be better for you
to be concerned about me

05:32.732 --> 05:35.076
and what will happen
should you refuse to help.

05:35.134 --> 05:38.047
I hope your Latin is
as good as your German.

05:38.204 --> 05:41.913
Si vis pacem, para bellum

05:44.177 --> 05:45.986
Auf Wiedersehen , Captain

06:00.593 --> 06:02.402
Si vis pacem, para bellum

06:04.030 --> 06:07.409
"If you seek peace,
prepare for war."

06:13.639 --> 06:14.674
Thanks for picking him up.

06:14.741 --> 06:16.345
I don't get my car
back until tomorrow.

06:16.409 --> 06:17.444
Coffee? Bacon?

06:17.510 --> 06:20.286
I usually take cream with my coffee,
but I'll try bacon.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.155
I heard about you and Adalind.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.059
We were together for about
half a cup of coffee.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.064
I don't know what happened,
where it came from,

06:27.120 --> 06:28.531
but I'm glad it's over.

06:28.588 --> 06:30.397
Well, between you and me,

06:30.456 --> 06:31.696
she was definitely not
good enough for you.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.898
If she wasn't a lawyer,
I'd think she roofied me.

06:34.961 --> 06:36.406
What? I woke up.

06:36.462 --> 06:37.805
She was gone.

06:37.864 --> 06:40.902
And these two other people
were in the room with me.

06:41.167 --> 06:42.578
It's more than I want to get into.

06:42.635 --> 06:44.945
Hank, it's more than I want you to.

06:46.839 --> 06:48.841
Whoa, whoa, whoa! He is mine.

06:49.175 --> 06:50.176
He's all yours.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.314
I'll see you tonight? Mmm-hmm.

06:52.378 --> 06:53.686
We've got a shooting
at the bus depot.

06:53.746 --> 06:54.747
Bodies?

06:55.481 --> 06:57.017
Just blood. Yuck.

06:58.684 --> 07:00.425
Bye. Watch your butts out there.

07:00.486 --> 07:01.487
We will.

07:33.719 --> 07:34.823
Rosalie!

07:36.889 --> 07:38.027
Ian?

07:38.090 --> 07:39.865
Oh, my God. What happened to you?

07:39.926 --> 07:41.405
I was shot.

07:41.761 --> 07:42.831
I have to get you to a hospital.

07:42.895 --> 07:45.432
No, no, no, no. You can't.
If they find out where I am,

07:45.498 --> 07:46.670
I'm as good as dead.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.538
Where's Freddy?

07:49.936 --> 07:51.711
Freddy was killed.

07:52.338 --> 07:53.749
In a robbery a few weeks ago.

07:56.509 --> 07:59.149
Freddy was supposed to
have some papers for me.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.816
That's why I'm here.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.315
Papers for what?

08:03.082 --> 08:04.356
A new identity.

08:04.884 --> 08:06.022
Who's trying to kill you?

08:06.085 --> 08:07.462
It's better if you don't know

08:07.520 --> 08:09.022
and it's better if I leave.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.693
You're not going anywhere.
Not like this.

08:13.092 --> 08:14.696
I'll help you UP

08:14.760 --> 08:16.603
I'll get you something
for the pain.

08:16.662 --> 08:17.663
I'm going to get some help.

08:18.431 --> 08:22.004
Apparently, the gunman crossed the
street here. Fired three times.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.480
Hence, broken car window,

08:24.537 --> 08:26.676
the defacing of our
friendly visitor greeting...

08:27.907 --> 08:30.683
Best guess is bloodstain
belongs to bullet number three.

08:31.110 --> 08:32.248
So, somebody got hit.

08:32.311 --> 08:33.381
But no body.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.448
Not yet. The search is ongoing.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.722
No blood trail to follow,
so we cordoned off five blocks.

08:37.783 --> 08:39.558
Any description of the
shooter or the ViC?

08:39.619 --> 08:41.929
We've got a witness at the bus
station awaiting your arrival.

08:41.988 --> 08:43.261
Maybe surveillance tape.

08:43.322 --> 08:44.323
And, uh, can I get that, please?

08:44.390 --> 08:45.767
Yes, sir.

08:46.893 --> 08:47.928
This.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.708
Nine millimeter. Yep.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.108
Let's check the witness.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.808
BUS DRIVER:
I didn't see the shooter.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.576
But I saw the guy
that was on my bus.

08:58.638 --> 09:00.709
He left this hat on the seat.

09:00.940 --> 09:01.975
I tried to catch up with him,

09:02.041 --> 09:03.748
but he was moving way too fast.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.823
Then, I saw that
car window shatter.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.414
I didn't know what the
hell was going on.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.084
Figured it was some
kind of gang thing.

09:09.148 --> 09:11.219
What can you tell us about him?

09:11.284 --> 09:12.422
His name.

09:13.653 --> 09:16.361
This is the ticket he
used to board the bus.

09:16.422 --> 09:18.561
Paid in cash. Lester Cullum.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.431
Had one of those old
leather rucksacks.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.530
You don't see too
many of those anymore.

09:22.595 --> 09:25.098
And British, I think.
He had an accent.

09:25.164 --> 09:28.338
Anyway, uh, name Lester
Cullum sounds kind of British.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.488
What's wrong? I smell blood.

09:39.545 --> 09:41.957
I know. Come with me.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.294
Please tell me this isn't
another zaubertrank.

09:44.383 --> 09:45.453
No, this one's a bullet.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.464
Oh. Well, look at that.

09:49.188 --> 09:51.464
Ian? This is my friend, Monroe.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.664
Monroe, this is Ian.

09:53.726 --> 09:54.727
Hey.

09:55.227 --> 09:56.228
Is he a doctor?

09:56.295 --> 09:58.366
No. But he's going to help
me get the bullet out.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.308
Why aren't we taking
him to a hospital?

10:00.366 --> 10:02.073
We can't. We have to do this now.

10:03.102 --> 10:06.276
I'm sorry. I don't entirely
understand the situation here.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.580
Ian is an old friend.
He's on the run.

10:08.641 --> 10:10.314
Someone tried to kill him.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.151
Well, what did he do?

10:12.612 --> 10:13.920
Have you heard of the Lauffer?

10:13.980 --> 10:15.288
The Lauffer? You mean,
the Resistance?

10:15.348 --> 10:16.884
Yeah, sure. But that's not here.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.019
That's old country stuff.

10:18.084 --> 10:19.461
Well, it's here now.

10:19.518 --> 10:21.395
That's Ian Harmon.
Have you heard of him?

10:21.454 --> 10:24.367
Really? The journalist?

10:24.423 --> 10:26.425
Yeah, well, he does that, too.

10:27.026 --> 10:28.699
He's one of the leaders
of the Resistance.

10:29.862 --> 10:31.773
So, are we talking
about the Verrat?

10:31.864 --> 10:33.434
Because those guys are serious.

10:33.499 --> 10:35.740
I think so.
Look, I cleaned the wound.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.678
I can see the bullet.
It's not that far in.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.678
And we're going to get it out how?

10:41.073 --> 10:43.417
This is my father's. I used to
watch him do this kind of thing.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.321
I just don't want to do it alone.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.414
Okay.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.420
What do you want me to do?

10:50.149 --> 10:52.356
Wash your hands. Sterilize these.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.653
Okay.

10:54.020 --> 10:56.398
Uh, upper right. We should see him.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.261
Well, that's got to be him.

10:59.892 --> 11:02.270
Average height. Average build.

11:02.628 --> 11:03.698
Rucksack.

11:03.763 --> 11:04.798
That will narrow it down.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.366
Any luck with the ID?

11:06.432 --> 11:07.570
I'm having a little
trouble connecting

11:07.633 --> 11:09.943
Lester Cullum to anybody.
It could be an alias.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.037
What about the bullet?

11:11.103 --> 11:13.413
We thought it was a regular
nine millimeter. It's not.

11:13.472 --> 11:15.383
According to ballistics,
the makeup of the brass

11:15.441 --> 11:18.786
identifies the company as
Deutsche Waffen Munitions,

11:18.844 --> 11:21.654
who manufactured the bullets for
their Luger semi-automatic pistols.

11:21.714 --> 11:23.022
What is this, 1944?

11:23.082 --> 11:24.652
Actually, it was
introduced in 1902.

11:24.717 --> 11:26.424
I think that eliminates
a gang shooting.

11:26.485 --> 11:28.590
More like a hit gone wrong.

11:28.821 --> 11:29.891
Guys, we've got a
shooter on the loose.

11:29.955 --> 11:31.093
And nothing from the hospitals.

11:31.157 --> 11:33.433
Nobody showing up with bullet
wounds in the last 12 hours.

11:33.592 --> 11:35.469
You know, we should check
with the St. Louis PD,

11:35.528 --> 11:37.269
where Lester Cullum
boarded the bus.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.932
See if we can get
any hits on there.

11:38.998 --> 11:40.534
Now, if we've got a
shooter still out there

11:40.599 --> 11:42.306
and the guy he's
after is still alive,

11:42.368 --> 11:43.642
he's going to try again.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.807
MAN 1: What the hell
are you doing that for?

11:44.870 --> 11:46.679
MAN 2: Bring it!
Right here! Right here!

11:52.011 --> 11:53.547
Hey. Knock it off.

11:55.748 --> 11:57.591
I said knock it off!

12:05.758 --> 12:06.793
Idiots!

12:08.260 --> 12:10.137
Hey, sorry about that, buddy.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.571
I've got one on the house for you.

12:12.631 --> 12:13.837
Oh, thank you. Yeah.

12:13.899 --> 12:14.969
Won't break me.

12:15.034 --> 12:17.139
Thank you. That is very kind.

12:19.138 --> 12:21.550
Look, I'm in kind of a jam.

12:21.607 --> 12:23.644
I was wondering if
you knew of any place

12:23.709 --> 12:26.189
where they make
some kind of papers.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.692
I'm a little out of date.
You know what I mean?

12:30.649 --> 12:32.151
What kind of papers
are you looking for?

12:33.252 --> 12:36.699
You know, something that
will get me out of here.

12:37.289 --> 12:38.359
Passport stuff.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.494
Yes.

12:41.227 --> 12:42.399
Um...

12:44.363 --> 12:45.364
Ah.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.912
This guy's good.
He's just downtown.

12:49.201 --> 12:50.202
Huh.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.041
I see.

12:52.204 --> 12:53.274
Are you sure he's the best?

12:53.339 --> 12:55.285
'Cause I can't afford
to get caught again.

12:55.341 --> 12:59.153
Anybody in town like us needs
a job like that, he's the one.

12:59.211 --> 13:02.090
Good. Good. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.022
Oh! Better not leave this.

13:13.993 --> 13:17.065
How is it they allow a
Lausenschlange to serve food?

13:17.930 --> 13:18.931
What?

13:22.735 --> 13:25.375
Hundjager. What do you want?

13:26.605 --> 13:28.482
A dead man.

13:32.044 --> 13:34.217
How do you know he's telling
the truth about who he is,

13:34.280 --> 13:36.521
who he's running from, any of it?

13:36.882 --> 13:37.986
He was a friend of Freddy's.

13:38.050 --> 13:40.690
Look, don't get me wrong,
I liked Freddy,

13:40.753 --> 13:43.757
but he was involved with
some seriously shady people.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.427
Freddy made some mistakes.

13:45.691 --> 13:47.329
Just like we all do.

13:48.861 --> 13:50.306
But I knew him, too.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.910
Well enough to trust him?

13:53.199 --> 13:56.203
I was with him for
a year and a half.

13:57.903 --> 13:58.904
Oh.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.814
We're talking more
than just... Yes.

14:03.042 --> 14:04.680
It was a long time ago.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.513
Can I ask what happened?

14:11.016 --> 14:13.553
He left. I wasn't happy about it.

14:13.752 --> 14:17.632
But, that is all in the past.

14:26.098 --> 14:28.601
Look. If someone is really
trying to kill this guy,

14:28.667 --> 14:30.442
we should call Nick.

14:31.237 --> 14:32.443
I mean, I don't know
what he'll say about

14:32.504 --> 14:34.040
being introduced to a Grimm,

14:34.106 --> 14:37.144
but right now, this guy doesn't
have a lot to say about anything.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.554
Rosalie.

14:42.147 --> 14:43.558
I'm here. Rosalie.

15:05.471 --> 15:07.451
The same casing as the bus station.

15:07.506 --> 15:09.884
9x19 mm Parabellum.

15:10.042 --> 15:12.249
Single bullet to the head.
No muss, no fuss.

15:12.344 --> 15:13.516
Killer came in here with a plan.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.559
Which looks like,
"Get the money and get out."

15:15.614 --> 15:17.685
He might have tried to fight back.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.397
Got a passport here.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.900
Ian Harmon.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.530
Huh.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.471
Kind of looks like the
guy the bus driver lD'ed.

15:30.529 --> 15:31.564
Wasn't he the victim?

15:31.630 --> 15:33.166
Victims need money, too.

15:33.232 --> 15:34.575
Hey, Sarge?

15:34.633 --> 15:35.634
Yeah?

15:35.701 --> 15:36.805
We've got a possible
witness out front.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.314
Okay, hold him. Copy.

15:38.370 --> 15:40.316
Got a possible witness outside.
Who wants him?

15:40.372 --> 15:41.442
I got it.

15:44.076 --> 15:45.919
Hi, I'm Detective Burkhardt.

15:45.978 --> 15:47.218
Oh, hi. Hi, Detective.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.953
Uh, I was across the street,
and I saw this man

15:50.015 --> 15:52.621
come running out. I didn't
think anything of it at first,

15:52.685 --> 15:54.756
and then, the police cars
came here and they told me

15:54.853 --> 15:56.332
the bartender was shot.

15:56.455 --> 15:57.900
Do you think you could
identify the man you saw?

15:57.957 --> 16:01.268
If I saw him again, maybe.
Yeah. But it's a...

16:01.327 --> 16:02.829
Did you... Did you arrest anybody?

16:02.895 --> 16:04.306
Not yet, no.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.372
Is this the man you saw?

16:10.869 --> 16:13.042
Just take it easy.

16:13.906 --> 16:16.409
I'm sorry. I was
just trying to help.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.012
I just want to know if
this is the man you saw.

16:21.547 --> 16:23.584
Yes. That's him. That's him.

16:24.016 --> 16:25.222
All right.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.421
I'm going to need
your name and number,

16:26.485 --> 16:28.192
just in case we need
confirmation on the ID.

16:28.253 --> 16:31.166
Yes, of course. Uh, Max Kurtz.

16:31.223 --> 16:32.361
K-U-R...

16:33.058 --> 16:34.503
Drink this.

16:36.295 --> 16:39.742
Look, I hope you warned your
friend that it could be very

16:39.798 --> 16:43.974
dangerous for either of
you to be wherever I am.

16:44.069 --> 16:47.573
Hey, if you want to meet someone
who's dangerous to be around

16:47.639 --> 16:49.175
you should meet my friend, Nick.

16:49.241 --> 16:52.950
He's a... He's a friend who...
He can, well, uh...

16:53.012 --> 16:54.355
He's a Grimm.

16:54.413 --> 16:57.326
Well, okay, so much for
the hemming and hawing.

16:57.383 --> 16:58.623
Are you serious?

16:58.684 --> 16:59.754
Actually, yes, very. But, look,

16:59.818 --> 17:01.229
he's not what you've
ever heard about.

17:01.286 --> 17:02.959
He's right. Nick is
not what you'd expect.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.798
He caught the men responsible
for killing Freddy.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.930
And he helped me when I first
got here and had to deal with

17:08.993 --> 17:11.804
his murder and the
shop and everything.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.104
And he got Monroe to help me

17:13.165 --> 17:15.111
when it was dangerous for me.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.669
Monroe has been
helping me ever since.

17:16.734 --> 17:18.442
And how much did you
have to pay this Grimm

17:18.503 --> 17:20.483
to go after the men
who killed Freddy?

17:20.539 --> 17:21.847
I didn't have to pay him anything.

17:21.906 --> 17:24.079
Yeah. Um, that's the other shoe.

17:25.611 --> 17:26.885
He's a cop.

17:27.945 --> 17:30.950
I know. My first encounter with
him wasn't exactly friendly.

17:31.016 --> 17:33.257
But, let me tell you,
Nick is the real deal.

17:33.318 --> 17:35.491
And if you need help in this town,
he is the man.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.056
Or, the Grimm.

17:37.689 --> 17:39.100
I know it's a lot to fathom,

17:39.158 --> 17:41.502
but he's friends with a Blutbad.

17:41.593 --> 17:43.163
And a Fuchsbau.

17:45.097 --> 17:46.235
Listen, dude,

17:46.298 --> 17:49.040
he has saved my ass.
And I've saved his.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.610
Believe it or not, he's just
trying to do the right thing.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.241
Do you know about the Resistance?

17:54.373 --> 17:55.408
Yeah.

17:55.474 --> 17:58.045
Do you know who the Verrat sends
after anyone associated with it?

17:59.478 --> 18:00.479
No.

18:00.546 --> 18:01.684
Hundjager.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.792
That is so not good.

18:06.452 --> 18:08.125
Rosalie, do you trust this man?

18:08.187 --> 18:09.257
I do.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.199
Well, then, by all means,

18:14.993 --> 18:16.870
put my life in his hands.

18:17.162 --> 18:18.766
Possible motive for
killing the bartender

18:18.831 --> 18:19.935
was the money in the register.

18:19.998 --> 18:21.636
But our suspect was
supposed to be wounded

18:21.700 --> 18:22.735
when he got off the bus.

18:22.801 --> 18:24.280
Could explain his desperation.

18:24.336 --> 18:26.145
Any identification on
the man who shot Harmon?

18:26.205 --> 18:27.548
Nothing. He wasn't on the bus,

18:27.606 --> 18:29.449
didn't show up on
surveillance cameras,

18:29.508 --> 18:31.647
the bar didn't have any security
except the alarm, and...

18:31.710 --> 18:32.745
It was off.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.723
All right, let's pull
out all the stops.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.088
Find the one we know, Harmon?

18:36.148 --> 18:37.320
Hopefully, he'll lead
us to whoever shot him.

18:37.382 --> 18:38.383
Yes, sir.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.896
And check with Scotland Yard.
See if they have any record on Harmon.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.830
Might help us identify
who this other man is.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.094
Yeah, Burkhardt.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.334
Can you get down to
the spice shop ASAP?

18:51.396 --> 18:52.397
Why? What's going on?

18:52.464 --> 18:53.909
It's kind of complicated.
There's a man here,

18:53.966 --> 18:56.003
he's like, a civil
rights activist slash,

18:56.068 --> 18:58.674
I don't know, freedom fighter.
With a bullet wound.

18:59.171 --> 19:00.650
Yeah, I'll be right there.

19:06.879 --> 19:07.880
Yeah.

19:07.946 --> 19:09.983
Wie geht's, Captain.
How is your day?

19:10.382 --> 19:11.520
Where are you?

19:11.583 --> 19:14.689
I'm enjoying your city.
It's really quite nice.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.490
It reminds me a little of,
uh, Firenze.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.694
So, have you made
any progress on that

19:19.758 --> 19:21.294
terrible murder at the bar?

19:21.827 --> 19:22.897
You know, you laid out the evidence

19:22.961 --> 19:24.440
a little too obviously
for my taste.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.998
Well, if you'd helped
me when I asked,

19:26.064 --> 19:27.771
we wouldn't be having this
conversation right now.

19:27.933 --> 19:30.436
You needed a reason to find Ian,
and now, you have it.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.673
I'm glad you're taking
it seriously now.

19:32.804 --> 19:36.718
You never know when a desperate
man like that will strike again.

19:36.775 --> 19:39.153
Oh, by the way, I liked
your Detective Burkhardt.

19:39.244 --> 19:41.246
There's more to him
than meets the eye.

19:41.313 --> 19:42.348
What do you want?

19:42.414 --> 19:43.757
I want to know why you
didn't tell me that

19:43.815 --> 19:45.522
you had a Grimm working for you.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.188
He could be very useful to me.

19:47.553 --> 19:48.827
Why don't you make that happen?

19:48.954 --> 19:50.194
Well, he doesn't know about me.

19:50.255 --> 19:52.565
Then, you are playing
a very dangerous game,

19:52.624 --> 19:53.659
my dear Captain.

19:58.063 --> 20:00.600
Reginald's Camera. Okay.

20:07.773 --> 20:08.774
Beautiful, aren't they?

20:08.840 --> 20:11.047
Oh, yes. Yes, I mean, the Leica ll,

20:11.109 --> 20:12.588
I mean, belongs in a museum.

20:12.644 --> 20:15.989
And the Voigtlander,
it's very nice. Very nice.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.652
I would say you must
be from Germany.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.889
Yes, yes. I think my
accent gets thicker

20:19.952 --> 20:22.489
when I look at German cameras.

20:22.988 --> 20:24.228
Well, feel free to look around.

20:24.289 --> 20:25.791
I like to think of this shop
as my own private museum.

20:25.857 --> 20:28.167
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Yes, yes.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.106
Ah. Beautiful. Look at that.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.871
These pictures, did you take them?

20:33.932 --> 20:35.377
Yes. Oh.

20:35.434 --> 20:36.640
That's my daughter, Julia.

20:36.702 --> 20:38.340
Yes? And her kids.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.041
Emily, Tommy, and Joey.

20:40.105 --> 20:42.107
Tommy, Joey. Oh. Gorgeous.

20:42.174 --> 20:45.451
Look at the quality of the light.
And the detail.

20:45.510 --> 20:48.081
You know, all this digital
nonsense has no sense of depth.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.651
Do you collect?

20:50.716 --> 20:52.252
Not cameras.

20:53.552 --> 20:55.725
Let me show you my favorite.

20:56.655 --> 21:01.297
This is a 1926 Luger P08

21:01.860 --> 21:03.703
9mm, with a silencer.

21:04.363 --> 21:06.468
It's been in my family
for generations.

21:06.531 --> 21:08.101
It works perfectly.

21:08.166 --> 21:10.112
Uh, I can't say I'm
a big fan of guns.

21:10.168 --> 21:11.442
I can imagine.

21:11.503 --> 21:13.414
Especially when you
have something to hide.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.452
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:15.540 --> 21:16.883
Let me tell you.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.944
You might shoot photographs
of your family.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.287
Well, I will just shoot them.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.326
Unless you decide that they are

21:23.382 --> 21:25.919
worth more than lying to me.

21:25.984 --> 21:28.123
Yes? Good. Good.

21:29.254 --> 21:31.131
We understand each other.

21:31.189 --> 21:32.497
Huh, Reginald?

21:32.557 --> 21:33.558
What do you want?

21:33.625 --> 21:35.764
Oh, yes. Let me show you.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.442
Have you seen this man?

21:40.299 --> 21:41.607
Come on.

21:46.004 --> 21:47.039
Good, you made it.

21:47.105 --> 21:48.140
Hey.

21:48.206 --> 21:49.378
Okay.

21:52.744 --> 21:54.280
Rosalie called me
this morning, early.

21:54.346 --> 21:56.383
She said she had some kind of
breaking and entering problem.

21:56.448 --> 21:57.722
You said bullet wound.

21:57.783 --> 22:00.127
Yeah. I know. Hang on.
I'm getting to that.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.499
Don't move. Whoa!

22:05.557 --> 22:07.059
Nick. Nick, wait. Wait.

22:07.125 --> 22:09.332
This man's wanted for murder.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.567
Well, I guess he's just
trying to do the right thing.

22:20.372 --> 22:23.012
I found his passport next to
the bartender that he shot.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.214
Ian lost his bag when he was shot.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.312
That's how the guy who shot him,
got his passport.

22:27.379 --> 22:28.380
That's what he told you?

22:28.447 --> 22:29.824
When was this bartender shot?

22:29.881 --> 22:30.951
Four hours ago.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.860
Then, it can't be him, Nick.
We've been with him for longer than that.

22:33.919 --> 22:36.058
Ian's been here since I
opened the shop this morning.

22:36.154 --> 22:39.101
Clearly, he wants you to
find me because he can't.

22:39.157 --> 22:41.364
That's why he shot this bartender.

22:41.693 --> 22:45.505
If you arrest me right now,
then he'll know exactly where I am.

22:45.564 --> 22:46.668
Did you check him for weapons?

22:46.732 --> 22:48.939
He doesn't have any.
He came here because my brother

22:49.000 --> 22:50.172
was supposed to help him.

22:57.042 --> 23:00.546
Well, Nick Burkhardt,
meet Ian Harmon.

23:00.746 --> 23:02.487
Ian, Nick.

23:03.014 --> 23:04.015
Pleasure.

23:05.484 --> 23:07.361
The man who's trying to kill you,
what's his name?

23:07.419 --> 23:10.332
Edgar Waltz. He's an
enforcer for the Verrat.

23:11.456 --> 23:13.163
Verrat? I thought they
only operated in Europe.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.398
Their influence is spreading.

23:15.994 --> 23:17.940
They occupy positions
of power everywhere.

23:18.263 --> 23:21.506
Politics, industry,
organized crime,

23:21.900 --> 23:26.042
anything that is corruptible is
susceptible to their influence.

23:26.304 --> 23:27.544
Even law enforcement.

23:27.639 --> 23:29.641
Nick, these guys make
the Spanish Inquisition

23:29.708 --> 23:31.312
look like SPCA.

23:31.376 --> 23:34.050
And Ian's resistance group,
the Lauffer,

23:34.112 --> 23:36.353
is the only thing that
stands in their way.

23:36.415 --> 23:39.021
This world is on the brink of war.

23:40.318 --> 23:43.822
The turmoil in the Middle East,
the crises in Europe,

23:44.055 --> 23:47.867
the Arab Spring all of
it is tied together.

23:48.727 --> 23:51.901
Agents of the Verrat,
working for the Seven Houses,

23:51.963 --> 23:55.570
have infiltrated the highest
levels of all governments.

23:56.535 --> 23:58.105
Seven Houses?

23:58.170 --> 23:59.615
The seven Royal Families.

24:00.572 --> 24:01.915
This is not a new struggle.

24:01.973 --> 24:04.317
It's been going on for centuries.

24:04.376 --> 24:06.879
With this struggle,
the Royal Families recognize

24:06.945 --> 24:09.585
opportunities to gain more control.

24:09.815 --> 24:13.456
People driven by fear,
choose stability over freedom

24:13.518 --> 24:15.191
when their neighbors start to die.

24:15.253 --> 24:17.164
My parents were part
of the Resistance.

24:17.222 --> 24:18.667
And my grandparents.

24:18.723 --> 24:19.963
My brother.

24:20.025 --> 24:22.005
I never wanted to be involved.

24:22.060 --> 24:24.267
It always seemed so far away.

24:24.329 --> 24:26.969
Your people changed
the balance of power

24:27.032 --> 24:28.978
when they decided to work
for the Royal Families.

24:30.936 --> 24:32.108
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:32.170 --> 24:33.171
Grimms.

24:34.573 --> 24:38.180
Evidently, you don't even know how
valuable you are to the Royals.

24:38.510 --> 24:41.582
Look, I don't mean
to be insensitive,

24:42.614 --> 24:45.094
but right now,
I'm trying to find a murderer.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.187
And not get a Wesen history lesson.

24:47.252 --> 24:49.232
Nick, Ian needs your help.

24:49.287 --> 24:51.790
We have to get him out of
here before Waltz finds him.

24:51.857 --> 24:53.803
The only reason he's not dead is

24:53.859 --> 24:55.600
because the bullet went
through his pack first.

24:55.660 --> 24:59.369
But he lost his papers and
without them, he can't leave.

25:02.100 --> 25:03.670
Oh, you're talking about
getting false documents

25:03.735 --> 25:04.839
to get him out of the country?

25:06.037 --> 25:07.277
I'm sorry.

25:08.139 --> 25:09.743
This just keeps getting
better and better.

25:09.808 --> 25:12.152
Rosalie's brother was
the last stop for Wesen

25:12.210 --> 25:14.019
trying to get out of the country.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.587
He was going to help me.

25:16.648 --> 25:18.992
All right, look,
if all of this is true,

25:19.050 --> 25:23.055
then the most important thing for
me to do is to find Edgar Waltz.

25:23.388 --> 25:25.629
I can't promise anything else, yet.

25:26.291 --> 25:27.702
Okay, yeah. Fair enough.

25:27.759 --> 25:29.261
Does Waltz know about Freddy?

25:29.327 --> 25:30.328
No.

25:31.596 --> 25:34.406
Well, if he did,
I would be dead by now.

25:34.633 --> 25:36.510
And so would they.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.339
Okay, stay here for now.

25:40.672 --> 25:42.913
Do you know where you
can get him new papers?

25:43.241 --> 25:45.187
I think so. We were looking
through the shop and found a

25:45.243 --> 25:47.484
bunch of fake passports
of my brother's.

25:47.646 --> 25:49.421
I know the man who did them.
His name is Reginald...

25:49.481 --> 25:51.154
Don't tell me anymore. Okay?

25:51.216 --> 25:52.456
Okay.

25:52.517 --> 25:53.791
I'll call you when I get something.

25:53.852 --> 25:55.195
Thanks, Nick.

26:03.662 --> 26:05.232
May I help you?

26:05.297 --> 26:07.174
My brother sent me.

26:07.465 --> 26:08.603
Who?

26:08.667 --> 26:09.873
Freddy.

26:10.502 --> 26:13.039
I know you helped him.
And now, I need your help.

26:13.104 --> 26:14.344
Please.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.714
What do you want?

26:15.774 --> 26:17.253
A passport.

26:18.476 --> 26:20.251
Do you know who this is?

26:20.845 --> 26:21.880
I can't.

26:21.947 --> 26:23.153
He's been shot.

26:23.214 --> 26:25.558
He came to Freddy for help.
I'm helping him now.

26:30.956 --> 26:32.867
I don't know where else to go.

26:37.162 --> 26:39.039
I'm going to need some time.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.350
EDUARDO GRIMM: After being
told of their arrest,

26:58.416 --> 27:00.555
I was able to get close
enough with my camera

27:00.619 --> 27:03.429
for the first time, to the
place where they took the men.

27:03.488 --> 27:08.233
The Verrat enforcers executed farmers
associated with the Spanish Republic.

27:08.727 --> 27:10.968
These enforcers infiltrated
the highest ranks

27:11.029 --> 27:13.532
of the Monarchists
and Franco's army.

27:13.598 --> 27:17.045
They exacted Verrat law
across the land with impunity.

27:19.237 --> 27:23.686
Accused of stealing, these innocent
Wesen were executed without trial.

27:24.009 --> 27:26.853
Their true crime was marrying
outside their own breed.

27:26.945 --> 27:29.824
The Verrat enforcers were
identified as Hundjager,

27:29.881 --> 27:33.055
from a race so tenacious
and vicious that it is said

27:33.118 --> 27:37.157
they are birthed by consuming their
own mothers from inside the womb.

27:37.789 --> 27:39.359
Eduardo Grimm.

27:39.524 --> 27:42.095
Madrid. 1936.

27:55.974 --> 27:57.749
Yeah. Burkhardt.

27:57.809 --> 28:00.016
Hello, Detective.
Let me introduce myself.

28:00.078 --> 28:01.216
I am Edgar Waltz.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.483
Apparently, you and I
have something in common.

28:05.116 --> 28:06.618
We're both looking for Ian Harmon.

28:06.685 --> 28:07.925
Where are you?

28:07.986 --> 28:09.329
Do you know the terms
of a Freidenreden?

28:13.458 --> 28:14.459
Yeah.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.564
So, let's just say, um,
Union Station? 10:00.

28:21.332 --> 28:22.402
And how will I know you?

28:22.467 --> 28:24.708
Oh, I don't think that will
be a problem, Detective.

28:33.778 --> 28:35.451
Are you always this animated?

28:35.513 --> 28:37.584
Well, you made me miss my yoga.

28:37.649 --> 28:39.026
So, um...

28:39.951 --> 28:41.931
You care about Rosalie.

28:41.986 --> 28:43.124
I do.

28:43.922 --> 28:46.425
I care about all my friends.
Even the ones you don't like.

28:46.491 --> 28:47.970
I don't dislike him.

28:48.026 --> 28:49.801
He's just a Grimm.

28:50.829 --> 28:52.740
Well, we're all equals.

28:52.931 --> 28:54.137
Isn't that what
you're fighting for?

29:00.004 --> 29:01.039
Yeah.

29:01.539 --> 29:02.779
What?

29:03.641 --> 29:05.382
Hang on. Hang on.

29:05.977 --> 29:07.650
You ever heard of a Freidenreden?

29:07.946 --> 29:09.050
Who is that?

29:09.114 --> 29:10.149
It's Nick.

29:10.215 --> 29:11.489
Put him on speaker.

29:14.052 --> 29:16.532
Yeah, you're on speaker with,
uh, me and Ian.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.931
Who asked you about a Freidenreden?

29:18.189 --> 29:19.259
Waltz called me.

29:20.391 --> 29:21.597
Does he know you found me?

29:21.659 --> 29:22.797
No, I don't think so.

29:23.862 --> 29:26.103
He wants me to meet
him at 10:00 p.m.

29:26.197 --> 29:28.199
He asked me if I knew
what a Freidenreden was.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.609
I said I did, but I don't.

29:29.667 --> 29:31.613
It's a truce. A white flag.

29:31.669 --> 29:34.707
Meaning you both come unarmed and
you both leave of your own accord.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.777
Dude, you can't seriously be
thinking of meeting this guy unarmed.

29:37.842 --> 29:39.185
He will honor it.

29:39.244 --> 29:41.190
They have a great belief
in the sanctity of rules.

29:41.713 --> 29:43.090
Nick, one more thing,

29:43.148 --> 29:45.822
once the truce is over,
the minute you walk away,

29:46.251 --> 29:47.753
anything goes.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.994
So, watch your back.

29:54.025 --> 29:56.005
Waltz is getting closer.

29:56.261 --> 29:57.899
This place isn't safe anymore.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.190
Detective Burkhardt.

30:18.950 --> 30:20.623
I admire punctuality.

30:20.685 --> 30:22.596
Hands out of your pockets, please.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.729
Why, you too.

30:31.196 --> 30:32.300
So, I guess you really did

30:32.363 --> 30:33.808
witness the murder
of the bartender.

30:33.865 --> 30:35.970
Yes, I really did.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.308
Just so you know, once this
little truce of yours is over,

30:39.370 --> 30:40.974
I'm arresting your ass for murder.

30:42.440 --> 30:45.319
If you try to arrest me,
you'd better be armed.

30:45.376 --> 30:48.482
Which means you violated the rules.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.623
I don't give a damn
about your rules.

30:51.716 --> 30:52.956
I brought mine, too.

30:54.152 --> 30:57.065
Rules are meant to be broken.
Aren't they, Detective?

30:57.989 --> 31:00.595
But before you get
all bold and brash,

31:00.658 --> 31:04.435
take a look around and
count the number of

31:04.495 --> 31:08.272
innocent victims that will die
if you attempt to arrest me.

31:08.933 --> 31:11.675
So, let's not waste time.
I want Ian Harmon.

31:11.736 --> 31:12.840
You can find him.

31:12.904 --> 31:14.212
So you can murder him.

31:14.272 --> 31:16.218
You're a Grimm. I'm a Hundjager.

31:16.274 --> 31:17.947
We're not friends,

31:18.443 --> 31:21.390
but we've always been,
how shall I put it,

31:21.446 --> 31:23.084
allies of convenience.

31:23.147 --> 31:24.751
Not around here, we haven't.

31:24.816 --> 31:27.763
If you don't help me find my prey

31:27.819 --> 31:29.730
within 24 hours,

31:29.787 --> 31:32.791
you will be finding dead
bodies all over the city.

31:34.759 --> 31:37.000
Would you excuse me for a moment?

31:37.295 --> 31:38.365
Thank you.

31:38.429 --> 31:39.567
Yeah?

31:40.531 --> 31:44.035
There's a woman here. She's asking
for a passport, like you said.

31:44.402 --> 31:47.076
Good. Keep the package
until I get there.

31:50.808 --> 31:53.015
Oh, and if you
attempt to follow me,

31:54.045 --> 31:56.457
I will shoot the
first person I see.

31:56.981 --> 31:58.426
Goodnight.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.159
The killer called you?

32:06.224 --> 32:07.396
Yes.

32:07.458 --> 32:08.664
Wu is running the number right now.

32:08.726 --> 32:10.433
He said his name is Edgar Waltz?

32:10.495 --> 32:12.497
He admitted to killing
the bartender.

32:12.563 --> 32:14.008
I thought we were
looking for Ian Harmon.

32:14.065 --> 32:16.170
We were. This is the guy
that shot Ian Harmon.

32:16.234 --> 32:17.269
So, why did he call you?

32:17.335 --> 32:18.746
Well, he wants us
to turn Harmon over

32:18.803 --> 32:19.838
in the next 24 hours.

32:19.904 --> 32:22.111
Or he's going to kill
more innocent people.

32:22.173 --> 32:23.379
Do we know where Harmon is?

32:23.441 --> 32:24.749
Not yet.

32:25.076 --> 32:27.283
We're not going to be held
hostage by some kind of lunatic.

32:27.345 --> 32:28.619
Do we know anything about him?

32:28.680 --> 32:29.920
Not much.

32:30.748 --> 32:31.749
But I believe him.

32:31.816 --> 32:33.420
We ran his name,
but came up with nothing.

32:33.584 --> 32:34.722
Sir.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.129
Got the ID back on that phone.

32:36.187 --> 32:37.723
Bad news is it's a burner.

32:37.789 --> 32:38.995
Purchased and activated yesterday.

32:39.057 --> 32:40.536
Any good news? Yes, sir.

32:40.591 --> 32:42.468
The phone was at
this address downtown

32:42.527 --> 32:44.438
when we triangulated
it three minutes ago.

32:44.495 --> 32:46.202
Place called Reginald's Cameras.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.107
Miss? Your passport.

32:57.041 --> 32:59.317
Thank you so much.
What do I owe you?

32:59.377 --> 33:00.515
Nothing.

33:02.580 --> 33:03.650
I'm sorry.

33:03.715 --> 33:04.785
For what?

33:05.049 --> 33:07.393
Uh, your brother.
He was a good friend.

33:09.587 --> 33:10.998
Thank you.

33:24.402 --> 33:25.745
Well done.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.647
You promise you won't
hurt my family.

33:28.706 --> 33:30.982
Of course not. You kept
your end of the bargain.

33:31.042 --> 33:33.750
I would never dream of
touching your family.

34:28.266 --> 34:30.643
That must be the burner phone.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.275
He's playing us.

34:49.286 --> 34:51.233
Oh, hi. Uh, are you open?

34:51.289 --> 34:52.699
I'm sorry. We're closed.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.565
Why don't you come back tomorrow?
We open at nine.

34:54.625 --> 34:55.797
Oh, please. Just a minute?

34:55.860 --> 34:58.363
I was told I could
get some help here.

35:00.465 --> 35:02.604
Give me a minute.
I'll see what I can do.

35:02.667 --> 35:04.442
Thank you. Thank you so much.

35:26.491 --> 35:27.868
Where is he?

35:39.670 --> 35:42.617
Oh, it's a good likeness,
don't you think?

35:44.108 --> 35:46.384
Look, I'd prefer not to hurt you.

35:46.744 --> 35:48.587
So go ahead. Call him.

35:49.247 --> 35:51.693
Let's see whose life is
more important to him.

35:52.116 --> 35:53.288
Goon.

35:59.190 --> 36:00.328
Hey. Did you make
it back from the...

36:00.391 --> 36:02.132
He's here, get Ian to safety.

36:03.895 --> 36:06.375
Are you done? Have you
said all you wanted to?

36:07.999 --> 36:10.343
May I? Thank you.

36:12.737 --> 36:13.943
Ian?

36:14.005 --> 36:16.007
I swear, If you touch
a hair on her head...

36:16.073 --> 36:17.677
I don't know who you are,

36:17.742 --> 36:19.278
but let me keep it simple for you.

36:19.343 --> 36:22.813
If you do not deliver Ian
Harmon to me in 15 minutes,

36:23.314 --> 36:25.089
I will kill your girlfriend.

36:39.730 --> 36:40.765
Yeah, Burkhardt.

36:40.831 --> 36:41.832
We have a problem.

36:41.966 --> 36:43.104
We're going back to the shop.

36:43.167 --> 36:46.444
Waltz has Rosalie.
He wants to make a trade.

36:47.605 --> 36:49.312
No, he's not going to trade.
He's going to kill you all.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.284
Well, if you've got a
better plan, I'm all ears.

36:51.809 --> 36:53.948
Just, um, give me five minutes.

36:54.011 --> 36:55.115
Maybe I can come up with one.

36:55.179 --> 36:57.352
We don't have five minutes, Nick.

36:57.415 --> 36:59.656
Don't do anything
until I get there.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.822
I'll wait as long as I can.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.431
But if push comes to shove,
I'm shoving.

37:06.624 --> 37:08.865
You may think I'm a monster,

37:10.094 --> 37:12.472
but what I am is necessary.

37:13.364 --> 37:15.776
No society can survive
without order.

37:16.601 --> 37:19.741
Free thought is not free.
There's no such thing as revolution.

37:19.804 --> 37:22.444
The oppressed always
become the oppressors.

37:22.506 --> 37:25.715
And the cycle repeats
itself over and over.

37:26.444 --> 37:30.221
The only way to win is
to stay out of the cycle.

37:31.682 --> 37:33.593
You don't understand a
word that I've been saying.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.130
I'm sorry. l wasn't listening.

37:40.825 --> 37:42.133
No, no. You're staying here.

37:42.193 --> 37:44.332
No, no, no. This is my fight.

37:44.395 --> 37:45.897
Nobody is going to fight it for me.

37:45.963 --> 37:47.442
The second he sees you,
you're dead.

37:47.498 --> 37:48.533
He doesn't know who I am.

37:48.599 --> 37:49.771
That doesn't mean he's
not going to kill you.

37:49.834 --> 37:50.938
Yeah, I get that.

37:51.002 --> 37:54.040
But we're not doing anything
until we find out about Rosalie.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.516
If she isn't already dead.

37:55.573 --> 37:57.484
Don't let your emotions
get the better of you.

37:57.541 --> 37:59.452
He will use that to his advantage.

37:59.510 --> 38:01.319
That's why he took her.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.422
I have a plan.

38:07.485 --> 38:08.555
You do? For real?

38:08.619 --> 38:10.724
Yeah. I'm going in.
You're staying out.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.665
No, no, no. You don't
understand Waltz.

38:12.723 --> 38:14.225
I understand him better
than you think I do.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.327
He won't be expecting me,

38:15.393 --> 38:16.872
and he doesn't know my
connection to any of you.

38:16.927 --> 38:18.270
So, what does that get us?

38:18.696 --> 38:19.800
Time.

38:25.603 --> 38:29.016
Well, it seems like your
Fuchsbau hero is a coward.

38:31.375 --> 38:32.513
Waltz.

38:32.843 --> 38:34.254
How did you know? You want Ian?

38:34.779 --> 38:35.780
I've got him.

38:35.846 --> 38:36.881
What?

38:36.947 --> 38:39.723
Shut up. Get on the floor.
Get on the floor.

38:40.818 --> 38:43.298
If you've got him, where is he?

38:45.890 --> 38:46.925
Whoa!

38:46.991 --> 38:48.334
Who are you?

38:48.392 --> 38:50.736
I'm the guy you called.
I've got Ian. Who's he?

38:50.795 --> 38:52.399
What the hell is going on here?

38:52.463 --> 38:54.238
You're going to believe a Fuchsbau?

38:54.298 --> 38:55.641
What are you trying to say, buddy?

38:55.700 --> 38:56.770
Well, I'm saying you're a liar.

38:56.834 --> 38:59.440
All Fuchsbaus are liars.
Who did you call?

38:59.503 --> 39:01.039
I didn't call a Fuchsbau.

39:02.973 --> 39:05.817
It's true. I'm not a Fuchsbau.

39:07.878 --> 39:09.221
Blutbad.

39:18.622 --> 39:19.828
Are you okay? Are you okay?

39:21.859 --> 39:23.202
It's over.

39:23.260 --> 39:24.933
No, it's not.

39:30.501 --> 39:31.502
Hey.

39:31.736 --> 39:32.942
Put the gun down.

39:33.003 --> 39:34.073
I can't.

39:34.138 --> 39:36.140
He's right. Even if he's dead,

39:36.207 --> 39:37.845
they'll send others after me.

39:37.908 --> 39:39.319
Ian, don't!

39:48.152 --> 39:50.928
But at least now,
your friends will be safe.

39:54.125 --> 39:56.196
Sometimes, it's hard to know
what the right thing is.

39:57.828 --> 39:59.865
Yeah, sometimes, it's not.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.917
Nick. Nick, please.

40:11.976 --> 40:13.182
If the Verrat knows where Ian is...

40:13.244 --> 40:15.087
You've got other
things to worry about.

40:19.049 --> 40:20.585
I'm so sorry.

40:20.651 --> 40:22.028
Don't be.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.210
Nick, come on. You can't do this.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.802
He killed Waltz to protect us.

40:36.867 --> 40:40.178
Listen to me, there's only one
thing that you need to do.

40:40.704 --> 40:41.876
What?

40:41.939 --> 40:43.509
Get rid of Waltz's body.

40:46.844 --> 40:48.915
Yeah. Okay.

40:54.151 --> 40:55.630
Come on.

41:15.172 --> 41:16.480
Get out.

41:18.409 --> 41:20.150
What are you doing?

41:20.244 --> 41:21.814
I'm saving my friends.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.853
If you go to trial,
they'll be dead.

41:31.922 --> 41:33.595
Don't come back.

42:10.127 --> 42:12.266
How do you know this is Waltz?

42:12.630 --> 42:14.007
Passport.

42:14.164 --> 42:15.234
Found it in his pocket.

42:15.299 --> 42:17.540
And the Luger, we believe
it's the gun used to shoot

42:17.601 --> 42:19.171
the bartender and the
camera store owner.

42:19.236 --> 42:20.772
What about Ian Harmon?

42:20.905 --> 42:22.509
You think he did this?

42:23.407 --> 42:26.650
If someone was trying to kill me,
I'd be trying to kill them.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.650
If we ever catch up with this guy,
maybe we'll find out.

42:29.813 --> 42:30.985
I wouldn't be so sure.

42:31.615 --> 42:33.595
Someone else may catch
up with him first.

42:34.051 --> 42:36.429
This world is on the brink of war.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
