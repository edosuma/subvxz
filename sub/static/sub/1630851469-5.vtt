00:09.000 --> 00:11.640
Katrine Poulsen.
She's Danish Secret Service.

00:12.120 --> 00:12.960
Go back to the office.

00:13.040 --> 00:13.840
You need me there.

00:13.920 --> 00:16.120
Get out or we lose him.
And that's on you.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.520
Arguments over Scottish
Independence rage.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.960
<i>Scotland's share of the oil revenues</i>
<i>has been far too high for too long.</i>

00:22.040 --> 00:23.200
Stop it!

00:23.280 --> 00:24.880
-That's not me.
-Certainly looks like you.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.480
It's a fake. That's a fake.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.600
Redback has got
to be bigger than this.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.440
They came within a ball hair
of killing the Prime Minister.

00:34.520 --> 00:35.760
Drop the gun!

00:36.360 --> 00:39.280
We believe the attempt on your life
was funded by a group

00:39.360 --> 00:41.760
who are also
backing Scottish terrorists.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.400
I've been brought
into the inner sanctum.

00:43.480 --> 00:45.640
Pub on the Borders
in two or three days.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.160
Localised explosion.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.560
Maximum publicity.

00:48.640 --> 00:49.640
Tell Laird it's on.

00:49.720 --> 00:51.720
This could cost us the union.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.800
And it's scheduled already, is it,
for tomorrow afternoon, this action?

01:44.600 --> 01:45.880
Once you approve it, yes.

01:46.520 --> 01:49.120
You see, the difficulty
is that it's not in my hands

01:49.200 --> 01:51.760
because the pub is Danish-owned.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.000
So, I've had to run this
past Michael Jespersen,

01:56.000 --> 01:57.840
who has delegated the decision

01:59.440 --> 02:00.400
to his deputy.

02:02.800 --> 02:03.640
Poulsen?

02:06.840 --> 02:08.200
Oh, God.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.640
I've been on this for two years.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.640
What, now I've got to bring
in someone who I don't even trust?

03:22.840 --> 03:23.760
Temple Laird.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.080
Scottish nationalist terrorist.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.080
Intel has him behind three attacks
on English-owned properties

03:29.160 --> 03:31.280
and two on European businesses
this year.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.360
He's been arrested four times.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.920
Police can never find
the evidence to charge him.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.280
And no fatalities?

03:37.880 --> 03:39.240
No. So far he's always called it in,

03:39.320 --> 03:41.400
but narratives like his
always end in murder.

03:41.480 --> 03:44.120
I thought you were gonna concentrate
on Redback.

03:44.720 --> 03:47.400
We believe that Laird
is funded by Russian money.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.480
-You believe?
-Can we just concentrate on Laird?

03:49.560 --> 03:52.640
You think that Russia
would fund a terror attack in the UK?

03:52.720 --> 03:54.800
I've seen a Russian terror attack
in the middle of London.

03:54.880 --> 03:58.520
I watched the agonising deaths
of two men, so...

04:00.480 --> 04:04.680
Listen, what you're talking about,
those were isolated attacks.

04:05.280 --> 04:06.560
What we're trying to assess

04:06.640 --> 04:10.600
is whether this lunatic is capable
of a mass-fatality event.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.120
Sorry. Do you think
we're winging this?

04:12.200 --> 04:14.400
We've been tracking him
for two years.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.960
All of our reports are verified
by forensic psychologists.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.080
He is dangerous.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.680
And in 24 hours we can lock him up.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.600
OK, Laird's cell.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.000
Do you have an agent
embedded with them?

04:26.400 --> 04:27.400
Yes.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.960
Well, then I need to speak to them.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.840
<i>Look, as soon as we've won</i>
<i>the referendum,</i>

04:33.920 --> 04:36.920
<i>I will of course renegotiate</i>
<i>the Continental Shelf Act.</i>

04:37.520 --> 04:40.040
<i>I mean, it's obvious.</i>
<i>Scotland's share of the oil revenues</i>

04:40.120 --> 04:42.200
<i>has been far too high</i>
<i>for far too long.</i>

04:43.040 --> 04:44.600
How are they getting away with it?

04:44.680 --> 04:46.200
How do people not realise?

04:46.280 --> 04:48.440
I think they do.
I think people know it's a fake.

04:48.960 --> 04:51.120
Really?
That's not what we're getting.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.040
Tell me.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.760
Private polling... Forget...
Forget what the papers are saying.

04:57.720 --> 05:01.560
Private polling has support for
Scottish independence at 53 percent.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.600
Do you still think most people
believe the film's a fake?

05:09.440 --> 05:11.800
The revolt against reason continues.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.920
Idiocrasy in your own party
fans the flames.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.200
People choose to believe the film
because of your honesty,

05:19.960 --> 05:22.040
which is a drum
you're very fond of beating.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.560
Makes them feel bad about themselves.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.960
The film gives them an opportunity
to tell you to fuck off.

05:34.320 --> 05:35.880
I should kill the referendum.

05:37.720 --> 05:38.520
Resign.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.200
No.

05:40.280 --> 05:42.160
Mr. Ogilvy
thinks it's the best option.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.640
I think it's the only option.

05:43.720 --> 05:45.800
Absolutely not. Adam...

05:47.720 --> 05:48.920
We're gonna win this.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.000
I didn't agree to this!

06:03.080 --> 06:03.880
Hey.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.440
Katrine Poulsen. DSIS.

06:08.640 --> 06:12.040
And I didn't agree to you planting
a bomb in a pub, but here we are.

06:12.120 --> 06:16.040
Because the pub is Danish-owned
we had to run it past DSIS.

06:18.760 --> 06:19.560
So?

06:21.400 --> 06:23.600
Why doesn't Laird
plant the bomb himself?

06:28.160 --> 06:29.840
Laird's a strategist, all right?

06:30.680 --> 06:33.360
He never handles explosives.
His dad's old SNLA mate,

06:33.440 --> 06:35.720
Deke McAllister,
assembles the devices.

06:36.320 --> 06:39.160
Laird's father blew himself up
when Laird was ten.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.480
When the device is operational,

06:40.560 --> 06:42.680
Laird gets one of his soldiers
to do the rest.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.280
OK. Talk me through it.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.320
Right, so tomorrow
I pick up the package.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.280
<i>I drive out to The Skanda pub.</i>

06:53.360 --> 06:55.960
<i>I head into the gents</i>
<i>where I disable the bomb.</i>

06:56.720 --> 06:59.760
<i>Slide it into a cupboard space</i>
<i>and then call in the warning.</i>

07:00.760 --> 07:03.080
But the bomb
has never been touched by Laird.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.520
Kelvin will have car trouble.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.920
He'll call Laird.
Laird will pick him up.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.920
The police will follow Laird.
I'm wearing a wire.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.600
No, no, no. No wire.
No, we went through this.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.880
-It's a risk we can't take.
-OK, OK. No wire.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.640
As soon as Laird drops me off,
the police pull him over.

07:18.720 --> 07:21.680
And then the TNT residue from Kelvin
links Laird to the bomb.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.280
GPS for Laird's croft.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.200
And just in case...

07:29.760 --> 07:31.120
The transmitter's in Laird's lighter.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.600
I didn't tell you to do that.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.120
Nobody saw me.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.080
How dangerous is Temple Laird?

07:38.440 --> 07:39.640
Jesus Christ.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.200
He's insane! All right?

07:42.280 --> 07:45.280
He's sourced AK-47s
and suicide vests.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.880
And if independence doesn't happen,

07:46.960 --> 07:48.880
he will carry out
a mass-casualty attack.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.560
Have you seen anything like that?

07:50.640 --> 07:53.480
You're planting a live bomb
in a crowded pub!

07:53.560 --> 07:54.840
It won't be live.

07:54.920 --> 07:58.360
Look, I was yodi for three years
in Afghanistan

07:58.440 --> 08:00.520
and I dealt with 100 roadside bombs.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.800
I know what I'm
doing!

08:03.200 --> 08:04.760
Is this happening or not?

08:09.200 --> 08:10.200
I don't know.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.560
Just leave it with me,
all right? Just...

08:34.000 --> 08:35.240
What's that on your phone?

08:36.760 --> 08:37.600
Oh.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.320
When I was asleep,

08:40.040 --> 08:42.680
Theo wanted to tell me
that he loved me, so my wife said,

08:42.760 --> 08:44.440
"Let's leave a message
on Daddy's phone."

08:45.080 --> 08:47.440
Aw, that's the sweetest.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.880
He left you a message.

08:49.720 --> 08:50.800
What age is he?

08:50.880 --> 08:51.680
Twenty-seven.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.880
No, he'll be six next month.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.160
I love you.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.840
You know, if we lose Scotland,

09:01.920 --> 09:03.960
they become
the seventh richest nation.

09:04.560 --> 09:05.600
We drop to sixteenth.

09:05.680 --> 09:06.600
Seventeenth.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.400
God.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.120
Adam's taking a massive risk.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.480
There is a solution.

09:18.360 --> 09:19.960
But I can't suggest it to Adam.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.000
What is it?

09:25.680 --> 09:26.840
This solution?

09:30.640 --> 09:33.040
The referendum's
going to be a digital vote.

09:34.720 --> 09:38.960
I know people, who if needs be,
can tweak the results.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.920
Look, I know.
I can't believe I'm saying it, but

09:43.360 --> 09:46.720
if we lose, the economic impact...

09:46.800 --> 09:48.040
Like, people will die.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.600
If I made that suggestion...

09:52.680 --> 09:53.640
He'd fire you.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.480
I'd lose my oldest friend.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.080
What if it came from me?

10:29.640 --> 10:30.600
What's happened?

10:32.640 --> 10:33.960
Fucking spy.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.200
Infiltrator.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.560
Betrayal.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.040
Nothing worse. Nothing fucking worse.

10:47.880 --> 10:48.760
Who is it?

10:53.520 --> 10:54.480
Come here.

11:24.240 --> 11:25.120
Deke?

11:26.360 --> 11:27.840
I knew somebody was at it.

11:29.000 --> 11:29.840
Took me a while.

11:30.720 --> 11:31.520
I got proof.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.720
Both knees.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.600
No, don't do it. No!

11:43.480 --> 11:44.520
Do it.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.280
No, no.

11:49.480 --> 11:50.280
No!

11:51.440 --> 11:52.240
No!

11:53.920 --> 11:54.880
No!

11:57.360 --> 11:58.520
Do it!

12:07.000 --> 12:08.800
No, no, no.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.560
No...

12:25.040 --> 12:26.400
You were gonna shoot me.

12:29.200 --> 12:33.240
This little psycho
was gonna fucking kneecap me.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.480
Who's my little fucking psycho now,
you wee beauty?

12:39.000 --> 12:39.960
You passed the test, son.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.320
You're on for tomorrow.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.080
Right, give me that.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.760
Right, yous pricks.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.960
Let's have a fucking drink!

12:48.040 --> 12:48.880
Aye!

12:49.840 --> 12:50.920
He's shite-ing himself.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.360
I would have done it for the cause.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.040
Hey.

13:02.560 --> 13:05.400
So, my office sent information
on your guy.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.080
Kelvin Cruickshanks.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.280
Orphaned at four.
Seven failed attempts at fostering.

13:12.080 --> 13:15.040
On the plus side, he has a pretty
impressive list of petty crimes.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.720
Right, as a kid,
he took the blame for others.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.840
He's passed every security clearance.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.080
-He's 29 years old.
-Uh-uh.

13:23.160 --> 13:24.200
No relationships.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.720
His motives are adolescent.

13:26.800 --> 13:27.760
I don't agree.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.560
I want to make my mark.

13:30.480 --> 13:34.160
I mean, come on. Loneliness
and the need to be recognised.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.040
Well, he's vulnerable
to manipulation.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.640
He's a grown man.

13:37.720 --> 13:40.600
A grown man
that would do anything for you.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.480
I think it gives you a kick.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.240
So, do you ever think
before you speak?

13:47.320 --> 13:48.840
But the agent handler thing.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.360
That's more intense
than any love affair.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.960
When a lover
says, "I'll die for you,"

13:54.040 --> 13:55.040
they never mean it.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.520
But in our world, it's real.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.680
Are you gonna OK
this operation or not?

14:03.360 --> 14:05.120
No, I'm not going to OK it.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.800
I don't trust your agent.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.440
I don't trust you.

14:12.360 --> 14:14.000
But sometimes
you have to take a chance.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.480
Not with people's lives.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.000
Yes?

14:38.880 --> 14:41.520
Latest MORI,
Gallup and Harris Interactive.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.840
-Is there a consensus?
-We all think you're safe.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.720
Yea, well, they only register
the opinion of the polite.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.600
Zac says if we lose Scotland,
people will die.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.840
Yeah, well, Zac will probably
tell you exactly how many.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.600
It's avoidable.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.440
It is, if we win.

15:03.680 --> 15:04.880
We don't have to lose.

15:13.920 --> 15:14.800
How?

15:16.560 --> 15:19.800
Theoretically, the voting system
could be hacked.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.400
How would you do that?

15:32.040 --> 15:33.040
Digital voting.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.320
There are people who can manipulate.

15:36.800 --> 15:37.680
Really?

15:38.880 --> 15:40.160
It would save lives.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.880
"It would save lives."

15:50.360 --> 15:53.840
Nicky, I hope that was a joke
because if it's not,

15:54.560 --> 15:56.280
and I'd have to check with Etta, but

15:57.120 --> 15:59.840
I think what you just said
could put you in prison.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.720
Have you stood your agent down?

16:06.520 --> 16:07.320
Not yet.

16:08.200 --> 16:11.680
Look on the positive side.
Now you can concentrate on Redback.

16:17.040 --> 16:20.200
Do you know that the redback
is a type of spider?

16:22.040 --> 16:24.520
You know what the female does
after sex?

16:24.600 --> 16:26.360
Has a fag and a douche.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.080
-Uh, no, she...
-Yeah, I know what she does.

16:36.800 --> 16:37.960
Michael. Hi.

16:39.640 --> 16:40.440
Yes.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.320
Yes. Great. Thanks.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.400
Your boss has overruled you.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.280
-It's on.
-No, I don't believe you.

16:51.360 --> 16:52.240
Call him.

16:56.800 --> 17:01.120
CCTV is disabled inside
and outside The Skanda.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.240
Now, you press this button.

17:05.080 --> 17:07.680
Starts the timer.
That gives them one hour.

17:19.240 --> 17:20.560
From Mr. Laird.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.840
You're like a son to him,
you know that?

17:29.080 --> 17:30.360
He was in the Black Watch?

17:30.440 --> 17:32.080
Belonged to his old fella.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.480
Independence...

17:37.320 --> 17:40.000
People think it's about politics.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.360
It's about blood.

18:02.000 --> 18:02.920
Good luck.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.200
Holly! It's Eva!

18:36.280 --> 18:37.240
Go away.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.040
Open the door!

18:42.520 --> 18:43.880
-Coming!
-Open the door!

18:50.280 --> 18:51.760
You forgot, haven't you?

18:51.840 --> 18:52.880
Forgotten what?

18:52.960 --> 18:55.880
Pub grub, cocktails.
All free. No cash required.

18:55.960 --> 18:59.560
Right. Yeah. 'Cause the honey monster
wants back in your knacks

18:59.640 --> 19:01.480
Don't be horrible. He's a nice guy.

19:02.480 --> 19:03.440
I'm not in the mood.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.520
Oh, come on.
You've not been out for time.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.280
I don't like Danish food.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.440
Fuck's sake, Holly.
Look at the state of you.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.280
Get some fresh air in your lungs.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.240
Doesn't it ever bother you?

19:16.320 --> 19:17.160
What?

19:17.600 --> 19:18.640
You don't fancy the guy.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.880
You're using him for free drinks.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.720
Holly, man, where's this coming from?

19:24.840 --> 19:26.600
I don't like
taking advantage of folk.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.280
Chill out. It cuts both ways.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.040
Yeah? What's he get?

19:32.440 --> 19:35.440
Hope. He can fantasise about,
you know?

19:37.520 --> 19:38.360
What?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.760
I don't know. A nice life.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.640
What if that's all you've got,

19:45.720 --> 19:48.000
it doesn't work out
and you're left with nothing?

19:49.640 --> 19:50.440
I think

19:52.200 --> 19:53.120
you need a drink.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.960
I can stretch
to a half-bottle of Bucky

19:57.480 --> 20:01.120
or we can jump on a bus
to a land of free cocktails.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.240
I don't like Bucky.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.600
Ah-ha! Yes!

20:06.040 --> 20:09.280
Come on! Get your face on!
The stage coach leaves at noon.

20:09.720 --> 20:11.840
-Come on. Move!
-Yeah, all right! I'm coming!

20:13.680 --> 20:16.000
Yeah. Beatrice. Good morning.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.520
Levi has some concerns
about the Scottish operation.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.240
The timing's not good.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.160
The timing?

20:26.960 --> 20:28.800
My agent's
on his way there right now.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.200
We can't afford another fuck-up.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.360
Not while we're contending
with Redback.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.520
We've had our funding cut
for the third year in a row.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.480
Look, we're facing multiple threats.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.920
This costs nothing and we take out
one of those threats for good.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.640
We're under scrutiny
from the Home Secretary.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.760
I'm under scrutiny
from the Home Secretary.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.560
All right. Pull the whole thing.
I'll reel Kelvin in.

20:50.640 --> 20:51.880
Laird will know we're on to him,

20:51.960 --> 20:54.720
and the next time he's on our radar
he'll be wearing a suicide vest.

21:02.840 --> 21:04.440
Don't worry about Zac Clark.

21:08.480 --> 21:09.480
No fuck-ups.

21:10.360 --> 21:11.160
Yeah.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.240
Listen, Laird.

21:43.080 --> 21:44.280
Yeah, I've got a problem.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.480
No, I'm outside the pub.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.520
But I had to walk the last half mile.
Something wrong with my car.

21:50.600 --> 21:54.080
<i>Fuck! Get the job done.</i>
<i>I'll get Deke to come for you.</i>

21:54.160 --> 21:54.960
All right.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.800
I made a professional judgement!

22:04.880 --> 22:06.760
Which I disagreed with. Deal with it.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.800
Michael agreed with me
and then you got Daddy to intervene.

22:10.520 --> 22:13.200
Do you ever wonder where you would be
if it wasn't for your father?

22:14.120 --> 22:15.760
-Yes?
-Fucking supply teacher!

22:16.280 --> 22:17.280
I'm about to go in.

22:17.360 --> 22:19.800
<i>-Laird bought it. We're all good.</i>
-OK.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.320
Call me when you're done.
Wait were we agreed.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.600
All right. I'm on my way.

22:26.400 --> 22:27.240
What is it?

22:28.200 --> 22:29.080
I'm fine.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.040
You're welcome.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.920
No, I don't have a spare.

23:01.880 --> 23:02.920
I know. I...

23:04.120 --> 23:05.160
I know.

23:05.640 --> 23:07.120
I fucked up.

23:26.880 --> 23:29.640
-Katrine? Are you...?
-What?

23:32.560 --> 23:36.120
Can you just go to Scotland and meet
your guy and do your job, OK?

23:46.280 --> 23:50.960
Cheers! Cheers!

23:57.160 --> 23:59.160
Listen very carefully.
This is Amy Brescin.

23:59.640 --> 24:02.080
We've planted a bomb
in The Skanda pub.

24:44.120 --> 24:45.080
Get in!

24:45.760 --> 24:47.400
Kelvin, get fucking in!

24:49.440 --> 24:51.000
No!

25:20.720 --> 25:21.880
Did you lose it?

25:24.840 --> 25:25.720
I don't know.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.360
You should go.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.200
No, I'm gonna take you
to hospital first.

25:30.280 --> 25:33.200
No. I'll be fine on my own. It's OK.

25:34.520 --> 25:35.360
No! Wait!

25:35.440 --> 25:36.840
The bomb went off.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.280
This is on you.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.040
Fuck.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.520
Kelvin, you set the timer?

26:00.240 --> 26:01.280
Yes.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.880
Could anybody have touched it?

26:04.720 --> 26:05.600
No.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.560
Could Deke?

26:12.760 --> 26:13.720
I don't know.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.200
Flat fucking tire, eh?

26:31.120 --> 26:32.840
You're the only one I trust now.

26:44.800 --> 26:45.720
I'm ten years old.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.560
My dad's in a locked ward.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.520
There's blood on his pillow.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.800
His face is half gone.

27:05.760 --> 27:06.840
I made him a promise.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.240
Scotland was gonna be free.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.640
Never gonna happen now, is it?

27:56.920 --> 27:58.000
Thanks.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.680
Have you been inside?

28:27.840 --> 28:30.160
They pulled us.
The building is unsafe.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.920
The fire chief's assessing
when we can go back in.

28:34.680 --> 28:35.520
Was it TNT?

28:36.440 --> 28:38.080
Yes. It was.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.280
Did you pick up anything else?

28:40.760 --> 28:41.560
Sorry?

28:42.120 --> 28:44.680
Did your spectrometer pick up
anything other than TNT?

28:45.480 --> 28:47.800
TNT tends to get the job done.

30:14.840 --> 30:16.240
He's not there?

30:17.120 --> 30:19.240
He's not in hospital.
He hasn't contacted me.

30:20.440 --> 30:22.880
There's no witnesses.
There's no CCTV, in or out.

30:22.960 --> 30:24.400
It was disabled this morning.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.240
The manager and the chef
are among the dead, apparently.

30:33.400 --> 30:34.520
They were Danish.

30:38.240 --> 30:42.600
You go to your meeting place
and, uh, I'll handle it here.

30:51.560 --> 30:52.480
It's OK.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.760
Just hold it together, all right?

30:53.840 --> 30:54.840
It's OK.

30:56.040 --> 30:57.320
Hey. Wait.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.600
-Holly.
-What happened? We just got here.

31:00.680 --> 31:03.400
I don't have any details.
What are you doing here?

31:03.480 --> 31:05.040
My friend's ex works there.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.600
I can't tell you anything.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.520
What's your friend's name?

31:11.120 --> 31:12.160
Niels...

31:12.640 --> 31:15.000
Niels Vilfort. He's the chef.

31:17.280 --> 31:20.640
Well, I've got Holly's number,
so if I hear anything, I'll call you.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.600
What if I need to call you?

31:22.680 --> 31:24.000
I'll send you my number.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.040
God.

32:01.280 --> 32:02.440
<i>Police have confirmed</i>

32:02.520 --> 32:05.600
<i>that the bomb blast at The Skanda pub</i>
<i>in the Scottish Borders</i>

32:05.680 --> 32:09.040
<i>has left a number of people suffering</i>
<i>life-changing injuries</i>

32:09.120 --> 32:11.000
<i>and multiple fatalities.</i>

32:11.080 --> 32:14.520
<i>But so far the exact death toll</i>
<i>is yet to be confirmed.</i>

32:15.400 --> 32:17.120
<i>The bomb is thought to be the work</i>

32:17.200 --> 32:19.800
<i>of the Scottish</i>
<i>nationalist terrorist organisation,</i>

32:19.880 --> 32:21.160
<i>Amy Brescin.</i>

32:21.880 --> 32:24.520
<i>A member of the group</i>
<i>called the police security number</i>

32:24.600 --> 32:28.000
<i>claiming responsibility</i>
<i>just seconds before the blast.</i>

32:29.040 --> 32:32.240
<i>This group</i>
<i>has been linked with attacks...</i>

32:33.360 --> 32:34.960
Right, well, I'll put a fire on.

32:56.320 --> 32:57.440
No!

33:00.760 --> 33:01.960
You fucker!

33:12.680 --> 33:15.240
-Who are you fucking working for?
-I don't know.

33:15.320 --> 33:17.080
Who are you fucking working for?

33:33.600 --> 33:35.040
I trusted you!

33:35.120 --> 33:37.080
I fucking trusted you!

33:42.080 --> 33:44.080
I fucking trusted you!

33:51.400 --> 33:52.440
Little brat!

34:00.560 --> 34:01.600
Do it.

34:02.320 --> 34:03.400
Do it, then!

34:04.800 --> 34:05.800
Do it!

34:34.040 --> 34:36.280
You all right?
It's OK, Kelvin. It's OK.

34:37.280 --> 34:38.080
You all right?

34:38.160 --> 34:39.960
Talk to me. It's all right.

34:53.240 --> 34:54.080
Hey.

34:54.520 --> 34:55.560
Hi.

34:55.640 --> 34:56.800
Something's odd?

34:57.760 --> 34:59.320
Yes. Odd.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.960
I found it in the gents.
It's the detonator.

35:03.440 --> 35:04.880
They used an AAL.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.840
It's the rubber seal
that holds the shot tube in place.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.480
So... So what's odd?

35:14.000 --> 35:15.120
Why is there two?

35:24.360 --> 35:25.160
Look,

35:26.040 --> 35:27.840
you have to talk to me, Kelvin.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.760
OK? I need to know what happened.

35:31.680 --> 35:32.520
No.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.960
No. You can have that
when you tell me that went wrong.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.240
I don't know what went wrong.

35:39.520 --> 35:41.360
I did what I was supposed to do.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.120
You couldn't have done!
Eleven people died!

35:45.920 --> 35:47.440
Somebody sabotaged it.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.120
Who could that have been?

35:50.200 --> 35:51.200
Too many knew.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.080
Who?

35:52.520 --> 35:55.360
That Danish bint, huh?
Her department.

35:56.200 --> 35:57.920
How many in your office knew?

35:58.000 --> 35:59.400
You used me!

35:59.480 --> 36:01.680
Don't blame the people I work with
for your screw-up!

36:02.520 --> 36:03.480
I...

36:07.560 --> 36:09.800
I killed 'em. Fuck.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.520
I killed all those people.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.200
There was a girl in there.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.200
And she smiled.

36:19.400 --> 36:20.800
She smiled at me.

36:25.640 --> 36:26.440
Come on.

36:27.640 --> 36:28.880
It's not your fault, Kelvin.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.240
I know. I didn't...

36:31.400 --> 36:32.760
I didn't mean to...

36:32.840 --> 36:34.840
I didn't... I didn't mean...

36:35.440 --> 36:36.480
What are you doing?

36:37.480 --> 36:39.520
Kelvin, get off of me.
Get off. What are you doing?

36:39.600 --> 36:40.400
Please help.

36:40.480 --> 36:41.520
What are you doing?

36:41.600 --> 36:43.600
-Please help me.
-Get off me. Kelvin!

36:43.680 --> 36:45.000
Help me.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.640
Don't ever do that to me ever again!

36:52.960 --> 36:54.880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:02.400 --> 37:03.240
Wait.

37:04.960 --> 37:05.760
No!

37:06.440 --> 37:07.320
No!

37:14.000 --> 37:17.080
The guy I talked to thinks
they used two detonators.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.760
Most of the evidence has been
formerly given to us to look at.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.920
And what when we can see
from what we have in front of us...

37:26.600 --> 37:28.200
Who benefits from this?

37:28.600 --> 37:30.160
The British government.

37:31.640 --> 37:32.920
What can I do?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.160
You decide.

37:39.760 --> 37:42.440
Now, Kelvin, the ambulance
will be here in a minute.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.960
This is on Laird.

37:47.720 --> 37:48.880
All right? Nobody else.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.600
You don't take the blame
anymore, Kelvin.

37:52.680 --> 37:53.480
Do you hear me?

37:55.160 --> 37:56.800
All right? You don't take the blame.

38:00.160 --> 38:03.200
<i>And as the standard death roll</i>
<i>rises to 11,</i>

38:03.280 --> 38:06.240
<i>we ask what does that mean</i>
<i>for Scottish independence?</i>

38:07.160 --> 38:09.360
I think we know what it means
for Scottish independence.

38:10.320 --> 38:12.720
Don't let anyone outside this room
hear you say that.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.280
Our official line,

38:18.320 --> 38:20.240
this is an absolute tragedy.

38:21.040 --> 38:22.960
We don't want it
to affect the way people vote.

38:24.560 --> 38:25.360
Right.

38:27.200 --> 38:28.200
The funerals.

38:29.440 --> 38:32.320
-I think we should consider...
-Do not say the optics.

38:32.880 --> 38:35.640
Should you attend the funerals?
That's all I'm asking.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.280
Or is it not better
we organise a service?

38:38.360 --> 38:39.880
Involve all the first responders.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.640
I'm going to the funerals.

38:42.640 --> 38:43.680
All of them.

38:43.760 --> 38:45.400
-The ones in Denmark?
-All of them.

38:45.480 --> 38:48.760
It'll be spun. Made to look
like it's about political capital.

38:48.840 --> 38:51.680
So, we put a poll in the field.
Somebody we trust.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.240
I don't need a bloody poll!

38:54.320 --> 38:56.400
I'm going
because it's the right thing to do.

39:00.800 --> 39:01.640
Well...

39:03.280 --> 39:05.560
I'm guessing you flirted an idea.

39:05.640 --> 39:06.640
Oh, he loved it.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.400
Said I could go to prison.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.280
No?

39:10.840 --> 39:13.160
Another day and there would've been
no need to mention it.

39:14.840 --> 39:17.920
Well, you always find
the silver lining.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.000
That's why you hired me.

39:22.560 --> 39:25.000
Kelvin's been sent
to Chatham Military Hospital. OK?

39:25.080 --> 39:26.680
I want an armed guard on the door

39:26.760 --> 39:28.600
and I want
round-the-clock suicide watch.

39:28.680 --> 39:31.040
And what am I supposed to tell
the Home Secretary?

39:31.560 --> 39:33.480
Tell him he'll have the answers
when we have them.

39:33.560 --> 39:36.520
And what about Laird? This whole
thing was about bringing him in.

39:36.600 --> 39:37.760
Yeah. I don't know.

39:37.840 --> 39:40.560
This is an unmitigated fuck-up,
Beatrice!

39:40.640 --> 39:41.840
This could bring us all down.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.080
I'm gonna fix it, all right?

39:43.160 --> 39:45.080
I said I'll fix it,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.040
Fuck!

40:22.320 --> 40:23.560
Morning.

40:23.640 --> 40:24.480
Good morning.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.240
Are you all done in Scotland?

40:27.320 --> 40:29.320
Yeah. Finished last night.

40:29.880 --> 40:30.800
Yeah.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.640
What I told you yesterday, I...

40:36.800 --> 40:39.000
I... I made a mistake.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.440
I was wrong
about there being two seals.

40:44.360 --> 40:45.320
OK.

40:45.400 --> 40:46.360
The...

40:47.520 --> 40:49.200
The force of the blast

40:49.800 --> 40:51.280
made it split along the seam.

41:00.480 --> 41:01.800
Better to know the truth.

41:04.280 --> 41:05.160
Sure.

41:07.800 --> 41:08.720
Have a good day.

41:09.240 --> 41:10.400
Yeah, you too.

41:20.800 --> 41:21.720
I get it. I get it.

41:23.240 --> 41:24.120
What happened?

41:25.800 --> 41:27.320
What do you mean what happened?

41:27.880 --> 41:28.680
To your head?

41:29.440 --> 41:30.440
Oh. Yeah.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.600
It was nothing.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.160
The baby's fine, by the way.

41:36.520 --> 41:37.640
OK, yeah.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.080
Right. Result.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.960
Home Secretary's guaranteed
they'll be no enquiry.

41:48.040 --> 41:50.480
The public have a madman
with a history of violence

41:50.560 --> 41:52.400
and terrorist
still under lock and key.

41:52.480 --> 41:54.560
Motive evidence. No CCTV.

41:54.640 --> 41:58.120
From now on, we can sign this
to history and move on.

41:59.160 --> 42:00.280
No more diversions.

42:00.360 --> 42:06.400
Tattoo Redback on your eyeballs!

42:07.360 --> 42:11.520
From now on, it's all you're
gonna see until we have cracked it,

42:11.600 --> 42:15.320
killed it
and pissed merrily on its corpse.

43:24.320 --> 43:26.880
Evil English bastards.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.280
Eleven dead
'cause you need our fucking oil.

43:32.360 --> 43:33.760
I know you need to believe that,

43:33.840 --> 43:36.080
but the truth
is one of our agents made a mistake.

43:36.160 --> 43:37.120
No.

43:38.320 --> 43:40.040
Your agent was EOD.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.240
That was sabotage.

43:44.600 --> 43:49.240
And you are some other bastard.

43:52.400 --> 43:53.920
That was no mistake.

43:58.800 --> 44:00.320
You don't like that, do you?

44:07.920 --> 44:09.640
Can't be having me in court.

44:10.400 --> 44:13.280
You wanna play the grownups' games,
you need to know the rules.

44:15.480 --> 44:16.840
I know the rules.

44:19.400 --> 44:20.920
I know who betrayed me.

44:25.680 --> 44:26.920
Who betrayed you?

45:00.800 --> 45:02.840
We've been
over Kutiev's online comms.

45:02.920 --> 45:04.400
Maybe he was bluffing about Redback.

45:04.480 --> 45:06.200
Then why did Adamov kill him?

45:06.280 --> 45:09.720
The coroner forged the report
from the bombing.

45:09.800 --> 45:12.560
Our intel
has Torben Jensen in London.

45:12.640 --> 45:14.920
He's in contact
with the bias linked to Daesh.

45:15.560 --> 45:17.600
You only care about yourself!

45:17.680 --> 45:19.800
I sacrificed every principle I have
to protect you,

45:19.880 --> 45:20.880
so don't fucking go there!

45:20.960 --> 45:23.400
I know about tweaking
the referendum results.

45:23.480 --> 45:24.920
You got it all wrong.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.400
It was a joke.

45:26.480 --> 45:30.600
Laird isn't the man I saw
and you can't make me say he is!

45:30.680 --> 45:34.760
I just had a message from Holly.
Someone she knows died in that bomb.

45:34.840 --> 45:36.440
Katrine said you know him.

45:36.520 --> 45:38.800
When I say no diversions,
I mean no diversions.

45:38.880 --> 45:41.320
Whoa, whoa! Redback? Who is it?

45:41.400 --> 45:44.720
This is an indication
that Redback is an individual.

45:44.800 --> 45:47.600
I have information
you're going to be interested in.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.160
Who is Redback?

45:50.280 --> 45:52.160
You know I can't allow that
to happen.
