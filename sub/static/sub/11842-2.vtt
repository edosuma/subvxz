26:37.944 --> 26:39.554
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.
IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE PLACES.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.990
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A MISSING GIRL.

26:41.034 --> 26:42.557
YOU MET HER AT THE CIRCUS
THE OTHER NIGHT.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.603
A TEENAGER NAMED NIKKI,
A CLOWN IN TRAINING.

26:44.646 --> 26:45.865
YOU WERE THE LAST PERSON
TO BE SEEN WITH HER

26:45.908 --> 26:47.344
BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED.

26:47.388 --> 26:49.782
YEAH, I REMEMBER HER.

26:49.825 --> 26:51.261
SHE WAS MAD

26:51.305 --> 26:53.481
BECAUSE THE OTHER CLOWNS
MADE HER STAY LATE

26:53.524 --> 26:55.222
TO CLEAN ME UP.

26:55.265 --> 26:57.050
THERE'S WITNESSES SAY YOU
THREATENED THE CLOWNS' LIVES.

26:57.093 --> 26:59.139
THEY STRIPPED ME DOWN
TO MY UNDERWEAR,

26:59.182 --> 27:01.010
MARCHED ME
TO THE CENTER RING,

27:01.054 --> 27:03.622
WHERE HALF THE AUDIENCE
THREW CHOCOLATE PIES AT ME

27:03.665 --> 27:06.581
WHILE THEY SANG THIS
"OH, SO FUNNY" RHYMING SONG

27:06.625 --> 27:07.887
ABOUT MY NAME --

27:07.930 --> 27:10.367
HA HA --
SO I THOUGHT THEY WERE DONE.

27:10.411 --> 27:12.761
BUT, NO --
THEY SAID I NEEDED A SHOWER,

27:12.805 --> 27:17.157
BUT THERE WAS NO SHOWER,
JUST SOME HORSE NAMED PEPPERS.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.811
OH, MY GOD.

27:18.854 --> 27:20.943
SOMEBODY DID THAT TO ME,
I'D WANT TO KILL THEM TWICE.

27:20.987 --> 27:22.902
AND I DIDN'T EVEN
SEE IT COMING.

27:22.945 --> 27:26.079
THEY MADE ME WEAR
SOME CLOWN MASK.

27:26.122 --> 27:27.907
SO WHEN NIKKI CAME BACK,
YOU GRABBED HER,

27:27.950 --> 27:29.560
FOLLOWED THE OTHER CLOWNS,
AND THEN RAN THEM INTO THE POND.

27:29.604 --> 27:31.388
WHEN YOU GOT OUT OF YOUR CAR
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED,

27:31.432 --> 27:33.216
YOU DROPPED YOUR MASK IN THE
BUSHES RIGHT WHERE WE FOUND IT.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.654
WHERE'S NIKKI, VON DEENIS?I DON'T KNOW!

27:35.697 --> 27:37.917
I NEVER CHASED AFTER THEM.
NIKKI DID.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.005
NIKKI?
Bryce: YEAH.

27:39.048 --> 27:41.094
I GAVE HER BACK
THE CLOWN MASK,

27:41.137 --> 27:43.444
THEN SHE HOPPED
IN ONE OF THE CLOWN CARS

27:43.487 --> 27:45.620
AND CHASED AFTER THEM
TO CATCH UP.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.622
AND YOU CAN PROVE IT WASN'T YOU
THAT WENT AFTER THEM?

27:47.666 --> 27:50.538
MY KIDS WOULDN'T EVEN GET
INTO THE CAR WITH ME.

27:50.581 --> 27:52.714
THEY MADE ME PLAY GAMES
IN THE MIDWAY

27:52.758 --> 27:54.237
UNTIL MY CLOTHES
DRIED OFF.

27:54.281 --> 27:55.891
HMM.

27:55.935 --> 28:00.156
Narrator: THE TRAIL OF
NIKKI HEAPS SEEMED TO GO COLD.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.768
THE PIE MAKER
RETURNED TO HIS APARTMENT

28:02.811 --> 28:05.727
AND PONDERED WHAT THE
TEMPERATURE OF HIS RELATIONSHIP

28:05.771 --> 28:07.773
WITH THE GIRL
ACROSS THE HALL WAS.

28:07.816 --> 28:08.904
[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]

28:08.948 --> 28:10.340
CHUCK?!

28:13.779 --> 28:15.650
I TALKED
TO THAT RING-TOSS GUY.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.652
HE CONFIRMED VON DEENIS
DIDN'T LEAVE THE CIRCUS

28:17.696 --> 28:19.610
TILL AFTER THEM CLOWNS
WOULD HAVE GONE INTO THE POND,

28:19.654 --> 28:20.829
SO HE DIDN'T DO IT.

28:20.873 --> 28:22.657
IT'S REALLY LATE.

28:22.701 --> 28:23.963
YOU GOT ANY TEA?

28:28.576 --> 28:29.925
IF BRYCE WAS TELLING
THE TRUTH ABOUT NIKKI

28:29.969 --> 28:31.535
AND SHE WAS THE ONE
WHO WENT AFTER THEM,

28:31.579 --> 28:33.755
THEN THAT PUTS NIKKI
AT THE SCENE OF THE MURDERS.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.235
AND HE SAID SHE WAS ANGRY.

28:35.278 --> 28:36.715
NIKKI DIDN'T RUN THEM CLOWNS
OFF THE ROAD.

28:36.758 --> 28:37.411
THAT AIN'T WHO SHE IS.

28:37.454 --> 28:38.717
I DON'T KNOW.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.022
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT PEOPLE.

28:40.066 --> 28:41.545
THEY DECIDE THEY WANT
A FRESH START,

28:41.589 --> 28:43.025
AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM
ENDS UP CHANGING.

28:43.069 --> 28:46.072
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT DEAD GIRL.

28:46.115 --> 28:47.551
WHY THE CHANGE OF HEART
ABOUT NIKKI?

28:47.595 --> 28:49.945
I GUESS MY GLASS IS HALF FULL
ON THIS ONE.

28:49.989 --> 28:51.730
GENERALLY SPEAKING, I WOULD SAY
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A GLASS.

28:51.773 --> 28:52.731
YOU JUST HAVE A WET RING
ON THE COFFEE TABLE

28:52.774 --> 28:54.210
WHERE THE GLASS
USED TO BE.

28:54.254 --> 28:57.561
HEY. WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A LOST LITTLE GIRL.

28:57.605 --> 28:59.650
NOW, MAYBE SHE IS A LITTLE
PISSANT PAIN IN THE ASS,

28:59.694 --> 29:06.527
BUT I DON'T THINK
SHE'S A MURDERER.

29:06.570 --> 29:07.441
WHY DID YOU TAKE
THIS CASE?

29:07.484 --> 29:08.964
NIKKI'S MOTHER ASKED ME

29:09.008 --> 29:11.793
IF I KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE
TO LOSE A DAUGHTER.

29:14.230 --> 29:17.712
DID YOUR DAUGHTER
RUN AWAY?

29:17.756 --> 29:20.671
WIFE RAN AWAY --
TOOK HER WITH SEVEN YEARS AGO.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.848
DOES ANYONE --NO ONE KNOWS.

29:22.891 --> 29:23.892
I KNOW.

29:23.936 --> 29:25.198
WISH YOU DIDN'T.

29:26.155 --> 29:29.593
I GOT TO GO.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.465
WOULD YOU STILL
RECOGNIZE HER?

29:37.166 --> 29:40.517
SHE WAS
A STUBBORN LITTLE THING.

29:40.561 --> 29:42.824
I'D RECOGNIZE THAT.

29:42.868 --> 29:45.479
AT LEAST SOME THINGS
NEVER CHANGE.

29:45.522 --> 29:48.047
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?
THIS IS ALL VERY WEEPY STUFF.

29:48.090 --> 29:49.613
YOU KNOW,
NIKKI'S MOTHER TOLD ME

29:49.657 --> 29:52.094
THE THING NIKKI HATED THE MOST
WAS BEING ALONE.

29:52.138 --> 29:53.922
SHE LEFT HOME WITH A MIME,
WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CLOWNS.

29:53.966 --> 29:56.055
I BET SHE NEVER EVEN LEFT
THE CIRCUS.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.839
I BET SHE'S TOO SCARED
TO GO VERY FAR.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.319
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?

30:00.189 --> 30:01.843
WISHFUL THINKING.

30:04.672 --> 30:06.282
I'M GONNA FIND THIS GIRL.

30:12.201 --> 30:13.724
ALRIGHT, WE'LL SPLIT UP.

30:13.768 --> 30:15.030
YOU TWO TAKE THE MIDWAY,

30:15.074 --> 30:16.379
I'LL GO AROUND BACK
TO THE BIG TOP.

30:16.423 --> 30:17.990
WHAT IF
WE CAN'T FIND HER?

30:18.033 --> 30:19.208
WELL, THAT MEANS
I'M WRONG ABOUT HER,

30:19.252 --> 30:20.819
AND WE'RE BACK
TO SQUARE ONE.

30:20.862 --> 30:23.604
Narrator: AS THE PRIVATE
INVESTIGATORS SET OUT ONCE AGAIN

30:23.647 --> 30:25.214
TO HUNT FOR THE MISSING GIRL,

30:25.258 --> 30:27.956
OLIVE AND LILY
ATE THE MORNING PORRIDGE

30:28.000 --> 30:30.002
AND WONDERED
IF THE TRUFFLE-HUNTING PIG

30:30.045 --> 30:33.483
MIGHT BE RETRAINED
TO HUNT FOR A PACKET OF SUGAR.

30:33.527 --> 30:36.269
I'D FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH
I HATED THIS MORNING PORRIDGE

30:36.312 --> 30:37.618
WHEN I WAS HERE.

30:37.661 --> 30:38.880
I COULD THROW UP
IN MY MOUTH A LITTLE

30:38.924 --> 30:39.968
AND NOT EVEN KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE.

30:40.012 --> 30:41.448
THIS IS A TERRIBLE THING
TO SAY,

30:41.491 --> 30:44.538
BUT I THOUGHT
THAT WHEN CHARLOTTE DIED...

30:44.581 --> 30:47.889
MY GUILT OVER WHAT I DID
TO VIVIAN MIGHT DIE, TOO.

30:47.933 --> 30:50.413
BUT IT DIDN'T.
IT LIVED ON.

30:50.457 --> 30:52.763
Narrator:
IT WAS THEN THAT OLIVE REALIZED

30:52.807 --> 30:55.941
SHE WOULD NOW HAVE TO KEEP
AN EVEN BIGGER SECRET FROM LILY

30:55.984 --> 30:58.117
THAT CHUCK WAS STILL ALIVE.

30:58.160 --> 31:01.860
MAYBE THERE'S SOME SORT OF
COSMIC REASON IT DIDN'T DIE.

31:01.903 --> 31:04.601
YOUR GUILT --
NOT CHARLOTTE, OF COURSE.

31:04.645 --> 31:07.822
I JUST CAN'T SEEM
TO PUT IT BEHIND ME.

31:07.866 --> 31:11.130
THE TRUTH IS, I HAVEN'T REALLY
PUT CHARLOTTE BEHIND ME, EITHER.

31:11.173 --> 31:12.827
Narrator:
SUDDENLY, WITHOUT WARNING,

31:12.871 --> 31:15.874
OLIVE SNOOK HAD A TINY,
YET VERY REAL, EPIPHANY.

31:15.917 --> 31:18.050
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T PUT
CHARLOTTE BEHIND YOU.

31:18.093 --> 31:20.704
MAYBE YOU SHOULD PUT HER
IN FRONT OF YOU.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.837
DON'T COMPLETELY LET HER GO.
CLING A LITTLE.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.360
WHAT ABOUT A FRESH START?

31:24.404 --> 31:25.796
IT'S TOO SOON.
YOU NEED TO GO HOME.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.363
YOUR SISTER NEEDS YOU.

31:27.407 --> 31:29.583
SHE'S LOST HER NIECE.
SHE CAN'T LOSE YOU, TOO.

31:29.626 --> 31:31.324
I CAN'T MAKE YOU STAY
IN THIS PLACE FOREVER.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.543
LILY, I CAME HERE
TO KEEP YOUR SECRET,

31:33.587 --> 31:35.806
BUT I'M STAYING
TO KEEP ONE OF MY OWN,

31:35.850 --> 31:41.812
ONE THAT I COULD NEVER,
EVER, EVER TELL YOU.

31:41.856 --> 31:43.510
TELL ME.

31:43.553 --> 31:46.295
I STILL LOVE THE PIE MAKER,
AND HE LOVES SOMEONE ELSE.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.341
DAMN IT.

31:48.384 --> 31:49.951
OH, FORGIVE ME.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.170
OH.

31:55.609 --> 31:58.612
NIKKI?NIKKI!

31:58.655 --> 32:00.092
CAN I JUST SAY I KNOW
YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF?

32:00.135 --> 32:01.702
WHEN YOU MOVED OUT,
I PANICKED

32:01.745 --> 32:03.573
BECAUSE I THOUGHT EVERYTHING
WAS CHANGING AND --

32:03.617 --> 32:04.923
EVERYTHING ISCHANGING.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.055
WAY TO RUIN A GOOD APOLOGY.

32:07.099 --> 32:09.971
WHAT IS SO TERRIBLE
ABOUT STARTING FRESH?

32:10.015 --> 32:12.365
BECAUSE "STARTING FRESH"
MEANS SOMETHING ELSE
IS ENDING STALE.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.977
YOU'RE CHUCK,

32:16.021 --> 32:17.370
WHO I DESTROYED
PLAY-DOH CITIES WITH,

32:17.413 --> 32:19.546
CHUCK, MY BEST FRIEND,
MY FIRST KISS.

32:21.374 --> 32:22.288
I DON'T WANT THAT TO CHANGE.

32:22.331 --> 32:23.898
YEAH.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.031
AND I'M ALSO CHUCK
WHO WENT ON A PLEASURE CRUISE

32:26.074 --> 32:27.858
AND GOT A PLASTIC BAG
PUT OVER HER HEAD.

32:27.902 --> 32:29.164
THAT'S NOT AS MUCH FUN
TO REMEMBER.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.687
BUT IT HAPPENED.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.254
AND WHEN IT WAS HAPPENING,
I WAS THINKING --

32:32.298 --> 32:34.300
WELL, ACTUALLY I WAS THINKING,
"SON OF A BITCH.

32:34.343 --> 32:35.736
WHY'D I HAVE TO GO GET ICE
FOR MY GINGER ALE?"

32:35.779 --> 32:37.564
BUT REALLY I WAS THINKING,

32:37.607 --> 32:41.176
"I FINALLY GET TO LIVE MY OWN
LIFE, AND IT'S ALREADY OVER."

32:41.220 --> 32:42.743
AND THEN YOU --

32:44.136 --> 32:46.312
YOU CAME AND YOU GAVE ME
ANOTHER CHANCE.

32:46.355 --> 32:47.356
SO IT'S MY FAULT.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.357
MY FIRST TIME AROUND,

32:48.401 --> 32:50.011
I WAS TERRIFIED OF CHANGE,

32:50.055 --> 32:52.013
AND I'M NOT GONNA MAKE
THAT MISTAKE AGAIN. I CAN'T.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.580
BUT HOW CAN
YOU START AGAIN

32:53.623 --> 32:55.799
WITH SOMEONE WHO ONLY KNOWS
WHO YOU WERE BEFORE?

32:55.843 --> 32:57.018
HOW DO WE MAKE IT WORK?

32:57.062 --> 32:58.759
I KNEW THE CATERPILLAR,

32:58.802 --> 33:01.501
BUT MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO BECOME THE BUTTERFLY.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.242
YOU DID NOT
JUST SAY THAT.

33:03.285 --> 33:06.245
DID NOT KNOW
YOU WERE THERE.

33:06.288 --> 33:09.509
TRUCKLOAD OF MIMES JUST PULLED
UP, AND THEY AIN'T TALKING.

33:09.552 --> 33:11.119
I MEAN, THEY CANTALK.

33:11.163 --> 33:13.034
THEY JUST AREN'T
SAYING ANYTHING

33:13.078 --> 33:15.994
EXCEPT THEY KNEW
THERE'D BE JOBS OPENING UP
AT THE CIRCUS.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.605
WORD MUST HAVE SPREAD ABOUT THE
CLOWNS NEEDING TO BE REPLACED.

33:18.648 --> 33:20.041
WAIT A MINUTE.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.087
ROCKY WAS LOOKING
FOR A JOB, TOO -- LOOK.

33:22.130 --> 33:23.871
"MIMES, JUGGLERS ARE INVITED

33:23.914 --> 33:26.352
TO FILL POSITIONS
AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY."

33:26.395 --> 33:30.530
THERE'S NO NAME,
BUT...SAME NUMBER.

33:30.573 --> 33:32.358
WE FOUND ROCKY THREE DAYS AGO.

33:32.401 --> 33:33.620
BEFORE THE CLOWNS DISAPPEARED.

33:33.663 --> 33:35.056
SO HOW DID
THE CIRCUS MANAGEMENT

33:35.100 --> 33:36.449
KNOW THEY NEEDED TO REPLACE
THE CLOWNS

33:36.492 --> 33:37.972
BEFORE THEY EVEN KNEW
THEY WERE DEAD?

33:38.016 --> 33:40.192
UNLESS SOMEONE KNEW
THEY WERE GONNABE DEAD.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.629
ARNO.

33:42.672 --> 33:44.587
IT WAS A UNION DISPUTE.

33:44.631 --> 33:46.024
UNION?

33:46.067 --> 33:47.590
THE CLOWNS WOULD PRETEND
TO GO DRINKING,

33:47.634 --> 33:49.288
BUT I KNEW THEY WERE HAVING
SECRET MEETINGS,

33:49.331 --> 33:50.680
TRYING TO ORGANIZE.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.465
THEY WANTED HEALTHCARE,
MORE MONEY.

33:52.508 --> 33:54.075
I WAS GONNA FIRE 'EM,
NOT KILL 'EM.

33:54.119 --> 33:56.077
HOW'D YOU KNOW
ABOUT THESE SECRET MEETINGS?

33:56.121 --> 33:58.210
NIKKI WAS MY SPY ON THE INSIDE.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.690
THE OTHER CLOWNS HAD NO IDEA.

34:00.734 --> 34:02.214
SHE LEFT HERE TO FOLLOW THEM
TO A MEETING

34:02.257 --> 34:04.390
THE NIGHT
THEY GOT RUN INTO THE LAKE.

34:04.433 --> 34:05.782
I SWEAR,
IT WAS THE LAST TIME I SAW HER.

34:05.826 --> 34:06.914
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

34:06.957 --> 34:09.090
'CAUSE I KNOW I'D LOOK GUILTY.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.092
WHEN SHE DISAPPEARED AND YOU ALL
CAME LOOKING FOR HER,

34:11.136 --> 34:12.746
I GOT SCARED I'D GET PUT AWAY.

34:12.789 --> 34:14.443
WHY WOULD NIKKI
WANT TO BE YOUR SPY?

34:14.487 --> 34:16.402
SAID EVERYONE THOUGHT
SHE WAS A WALLFLOWER,

34:16.445 --> 34:19.144
SO SHE WAS GONNA START OVER
AND BE A STAR.

34:19.187 --> 34:20.884
YEAH. YEAH.

34:20.928 --> 34:22.495
SHE DIDN'T LIKE HAVING TO PAY
HER DUES WITH THE OTHER CLOWNS,

34:22.538 --> 34:23.844
SO WE MADE A DEAL.

34:23.887 --> 34:25.759
SHE'D SPY ON THE CLOWNS'
UNION ACTIVITIES...

34:25.802 --> 34:27.587
IN RETURN,
YOU'D PUT HER IN THE SHOW.

34:27.630 --> 34:30.546
SHE SAID SHE'D DO ANYTHING
NOT TO GO BACK TO WHO SHE WAS.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.461
I JUST DIDN'T THINK
SHE WAS CAPABLE OF MURDER.

34:32.505 --> 34:34.202
[ MUFFLED BOOM ]
WHAT WAS THAT?

34:37.901 --> 34:39.686
OH, HELL NO!

34:41.557 --> 34:43.298
GET DOWN!

34:49.130 --> 34:50.784
TA-DA.

34:53.656 --> 34:55.832
I THINK THE HUMAN CANNONBALL
WAS MEANT FOR US.

34:59.793 --> 35:01.882
Narrator: WELL AWARE THAT
THE RANGE OF A HUMAN CANNONBALL

35:01.925 --> 35:05.581
IS LESS THAN THE DIAMETER OF
A LOW-RENT TRAVELING
CIRCUS...THERE!

35:05.625 --> 35:07.322
WAS THAT NIKKI?
