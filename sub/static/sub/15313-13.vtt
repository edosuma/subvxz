00:01.142 --> 00:02.940
- The King is coming.
- To Nottingham?

00:03.011 --> 00:05.776
Something has changed.
The King is returning.

00:05.848 --> 00:08.339
- Gisborne is saying...
...he'll marry Marian.

00:08.418 --> 00:10.477
- I promised to marry him.
- Under duress.

00:10.553 --> 00:12.713
Yes, to save my life and my father' s.

00:12.789 --> 00:14.655
- You do not love him!
- He has qualities.

00:14.725 --> 00:16.488
Gisborne was unwell, so he said.

00:16.560 --> 00:19.256
But he went to the Holy Land
to try to kill the King.

00:19.329 --> 00:21.628
The physician came every day.

00:21.700 --> 00:24.134
- Who was this physician?
- Pitts is his name.

00:24.202 --> 00:26.899
- What illness did he have?
- Fever. Contagion.

00:26.971 --> 00:29.235
- Tell me the truth.
- Sir Guy had business in London.

00:29.307 --> 00:31.242
He had business in the Holy Land.

00:31.310 --> 00:33.438
The physician will talk.
He did not treat Gisborne.

00:33.513 --> 00:36.380
- I do not know how to thank you.
- We'll think of something.

00:37.417 --> 00:40.945
Allan. Where is Allan? And Will.

00:41.022 --> 00:42.182
I have a plan of my own.

00:44.025 --> 00:45.583
The Nightwatchman?

00:46.595 --> 00:50.964
One final fling with something to make me
feel more comfortable in my marriage.

00:51.033 --> 00:53.263
The Sheriff has a scheme.
He intends to kill the King.

00:54.838 --> 00:56.203
Time to play, Nightwatchman.

01:00.577 --> 01:03.241
This Nightwatchman business
will be the death of you.

01:07.618 --> 01:09.712
- Gotcha.
- Robin.

01:10.556 --> 01:11.523
John!

01:11.591 --> 01:14.287
- This is not good, is it?
- Maybe not so good.

01:14.360 --> 01:16.225
She is going to die.

01:16.295 --> 01:21.290
- What are you doing? You'll hurt her!
- Where she is she cannot feel a thing.

01:29.010 --> 01:31.706
Where is the physician? I cannot wait.

01:32.580 --> 01:34.013
What have I done?

01:34.082 --> 01:37.713
Unless I am badly mistaken, the Sheriff
and Gisborne will arrive at any moment.

01:37.788 --> 01:40.950
- Your friend is dead.
- Dead?

01:47.799 --> 01:49.027
Marian.

01:55.407 --> 01:59.105
Robin! Oh, Robin!

01:59.780 --> 02:02.681
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

02:52.406 --> 02:55.204
You're getting slack, my friend.

02:56.545 --> 02:59.105
Could it have been easier for me, hm,

02:59.181 --> 03:02.844
if you'd led me by the hand
to your little hidey-hole?

03:02.918 --> 03:05.217
A clue, no.

03:05.288 --> 03:08.348
Allan. Where are Allan and Will?

03:14.031 --> 03:15.555
Now.

03:16.268 --> 03:18.599
- Stand!
- Oh.

03:18.669 --> 03:21.640
Stand or we shoot!

03:26.479 --> 03:29.472
- Er, there are two of you.
- Last warning.

03:30.150 --> 03:33.415
How many do you think
there could be of them?

03:34.221 --> 03:37.680
A dozen or so at the most.
Of the inner circle.

03:39.527 --> 03:43.486
- And how many of the outer circle?
- I don't know.

03:46.235 --> 03:49.329
You seem to misunderstand me, my friend.

03:49.405 --> 03:52.399
You do not have a bargaining position.

03:52.476 --> 03:55.968
Robin, what do I do with him?
If he dies you have nothing against Gisborne.

03:57.815 --> 03:58.975
Wait.

03:59.050 --> 04:03.750
Why are they not running? Why are
they not running? Hood must be in there.

04:03.822 --> 04:06.791
John? Now what?

04:09.964 --> 04:12.659
Bored now. Kill them!

04:12.733 --> 04:14.996
Positions.

04:15.068 --> 04:18.334
John, I think we're going to die.

04:19.374 --> 04:22.172
- A good day.
- What?

04:22.243 --> 04:24.769
A good day to die.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.082
- What?
- It's a saying.

04:28.150 --> 04:30.584
- Take aim.
- I hate sayings.

04:38.128 --> 04:39.254
Argh!

04:39.896 --> 04:41.797
There 's Hood! Shoot!

04:42.534 --> 04:43.932
Robin.

04:49.275 --> 04:50.502
Ah! My tooth!

04:55.381 --> 04:56.474
Where 's my tooth?

05:01.188 --> 05:02.951
Gisborne! Where 's my tooth?

05:04.691 --> 05:06.183
Eurgh!

05:06.261 --> 05:08.525
What is this? Hood does not kill.

05:17.140 --> 05:19.335
Do not shoot!

05:22.079 --> 05:26.176
Sir Guy! It's me.

05:27.318 --> 05:28.716
- Move.
- Sir Guy.

05:28.786 --> 05:31.416
- Kill him.
- I have always served you well.

05:31.489 --> 05:33.287
You've served your purpose. Kill him!

05:36.529 --> 05:38.020
Ah!

05:41.601 --> 05:43.535
You're learning.

05:46.140 --> 05:47.903
Second line forward.

06:01.659 --> 06:03.456
It's a good day.

06:10.335 --> 06:12.269
Come on, then!

06:12.337 --> 06:14.601
What is this? Is this suicide?

06:16.708 --> 06:21.170
We fight for Robin Hood and King Richard!

06:44.241 --> 06:45.367
Allan.

06:47.410 --> 06:50.072
- Do something, Gisborne.
- Regroup.

06:52.350 --> 06:53.613
Allan.

06:54.553 --> 06:56.213
Get me out of here.

06:57.289 --> 06:58.916
Robin Hood and King Richard!

07:01.460 --> 07:02.928
Get me out of here.

07:09.036 --> 07:11.231
Move back!

07:18.813 --> 07:21.476
Those blithering idiots cost me my tooth!

07:47.547 --> 07:48.946
Where were you two?

07:50.050 --> 07:51.381
I can explain.

07:53.353 --> 07:56.687
It's a woman, a mother, she was giving birth
to this newborn babe, right?

07:56.758 --> 08:00.193
We were going to take the haul.
Gisborne's money.

08:01.763 --> 08:05.699
We were going to take it to Scarborough.

08:09.638 --> 08:14.168
- Yeah. What can I say?
- Sorry.

08:16.780 --> 08:17.940
Really.

08:19.851 --> 08:23.810
Well, we're here now.
Saved your bacon, actually.

08:29.061 --> 08:30.085
What?

08:31.365 --> 08:33.094
We said sorry.

08:33.166 --> 08:37.034
Marian. Gisborne stabbed her last night.

08:39.506 --> 08:42.134
- And she's...
- She's dead.

08:45.847 --> 08:47.747
Marian's dead.

09:08.374 --> 09:10.739
We need to bury her.

09:10.809 --> 09:14.337
We must take her to Knighton Hall,
to her father.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.609
John, I want you to...

09:22.489 --> 09:24.583
Djaq, prepare her body.

09:27.128 --> 09:29.289
Will, I need you to make...

09:32.368 --> 09:34.836
- I need you to make a coffin.
- Shh.

09:36.138 --> 09:38.504
In good time.

09:38.574 --> 09:42.103
First... we say goodbye.

09:45.482 --> 09:48.076
She was a good woman.

09:48.687 --> 09:51.520
Kind and considerate.

09:53.325 --> 09:55.088
Good?

09:56.830 --> 09:58.798
Oh, she was...

10:00.600 --> 10:02.693
She was...

10:06.208 --> 10:08.175
She was all right.

10:10.879 --> 10:12.814
Yeah.

10:13.616 --> 10:16.380
Her, we liked.

10:16.452 --> 10:18.783
Her we loved.

10:18.854 --> 10:20.550
Her I loved.

10:23.894 --> 10:28.524
- I loved her and I never told her.
- Well, she knew.

10:30.635 --> 10:33.229
We all knew.

10:40.246 --> 10:43.704
I'm not being funny, right.
She's breathing.

10:52.426 --> 10:56.524
- On the blade. She is breathing.
- Eh? Told you.

10:57.633 --> 10:59.294
- What?
- The physician's draught.

10:59.368 --> 11:03.703
I have heard of this before. Hemlock.
Too much and the body freezes.

11:05.108 --> 11:07.407
The breathing stops.

11:07.478 --> 11:11.574
But if one is young and strong,
the body fights back.

11:11.649 --> 11:15.278
- Comes back from the dead!
- She died?

11:15.352 --> 11:17.822
And came back!

11:17.890 --> 11:20.016
That is...

11:23.529 --> 11:26.590
Marian? Marian?

11:27.634 --> 11:28.931
Marian?

11:32.973 --> 11:34.340
Where have I been?

11:34.409 --> 11:39.608
I don't know, but I'm glad you're back.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.647
It would have been nice to have dealt with
Robin Hood before the King returns.

11:47.724 --> 11:49.885
What?

11:51.262 --> 11:52.853
The King is not coming.

11:54.531 --> 11:56.295
What do you mean, the King is not coming?

11:56.366 --> 11:59.336
He is in the Holy Land.

12:01.039 --> 12:04.304
I have arranged an impostor.
Think about it.

12:04.376 --> 12:08.006
Is the real King, who spent God knows
how long fighting in the Holy Land,

12:08.081 --> 12:09.776
going to stop off in Nottingham for a chat?

12:09.849 --> 12:12.374
- A clue, no.
- Why?

12:12.452 --> 12:16.220
How many of our friends are against us?
Our pathetic lords.

12:16.291 --> 12:19.226
Merton, Woodvale, Edward.
How many of them are scheming?

12:19.294 --> 12:22.354
Smiling at us, lying, biding their time,
nodding their heads,

12:22.430 --> 12:26.093
all the while preparing for the return
of the precious Richard the Lionheart.

12:26.167 --> 12:29.535
Preparing to turn against us
the minute he walks through that door.

12:29.605 --> 12:32.268
- I don't know.
- None of them have ever seen the King.

12:32.342 --> 12:34.572
So, this way we find out, hm?

12:34.645 --> 12:36.476
The plots bubble to the surface.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.914
The rats come scurrying
out of the woodwork.

12:38.983 --> 12:44.217
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, sorry. Nothing personal. Hm?

12:44.289 --> 12:46.314
You should thank me.
You get to marry the girl.

12:46.391 --> 12:50.055
Yeah. But based on a lie.
The King is not really coming.

12:50.129 --> 12:53.121
Isn't that despicable?
How could you live with yourself?

12:55.469 --> 12:59.030
- What if Edward is one of them?
- I will hang him!

13:01.342 --> 13:03.607
Swap.

13:34.847 --> 13:38.874
- Robin, this is my fault.
- No. It was the Sheriff and Gisborne's.

13:41.254 --> 13:44.986
When the King returns, the Sheriff
will make his move. You know that?

13:45.059 --> 13:47.584
He will try to kill the King.
Help me stop him.

13:47.662 --> 13:51.292
My daughter' s wedding takes place
in Locksley on Saturday.

13:51.367 --> 13:53.996
At the same time the Sheriff
will meet the King in Nottingham.

13:54.070 --> 13:57.038
Maybe he's thinking I and others
will attend the wedding

13:57.106 --> 13:59.474
and leave him free to assassinate the King.

13:59.543 --> 14:01.443
But we must forget the wedding.

14:01.512 --> 14:06.040
- We must be in Nottingham.
- We? I don't think so.

14:06.117 --> 14:07.983
You, me and a number of loyal nobles.

14:09.621 --> 14:14.581
Now is the time to act.
To stand up and defend our King.

14:14.660 --> 14:16.925
- Join us.
- What about Marian?

14:18.264 --> 14:21.665
She cannot be left
to meet Gisborne at the altar.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.361
Gisborne!

14:24.506 --> 14:26.336
I'll get rid of him.

14:36.317 --> 14:37.512
Sir Guy.

14:37.586 --> 14:40.988
- I need to speak to Marian.
- She's indisposed.

14:41.057 --> 14:43.788
- Indisposed?
- Sleeping.

14:44.795 --> 14:47.855
- At this hour?
- She is unwell.

14:47.931 --> 14:49.662
- She's not here.
- She is here.

14:51.736 --> 14:53.636
I knew it.

14:53.705 --> 14:57.802
I knew she would not keep her promise.
She cannot run from me.

14:57.876 --> 15:02.041
- Sir Guy, I assure you that...
- Do not "Sir Guy" me.

15:02.115 --> 15:04.550
- Where is she?
- She has been injured.

15:04.618 --> 15:06.745
I do not know how.
Perhaps a fall in the woods.

15:06.821 --> 15:09.483
- Don't lie to me.
- I am not lying.

15:13.862 --> 15:16.489
- Ah.
- I told you.

15:24.207 --> 15:26.641
She looks pale. Marian?

15:29.346 --> 15:31.439
Shh. It's all right. It's only me.

15:39.458 --> 15:42.985
She is unwell.
I will send for a physician.

15:43.062 --> 15:46.590
No need. I'm sure rest and recuperation...

15:48.635 --> 15:51.570
Perhaps the excitement of the wedding.

15:54.442 --> 15:58.708
Is that true? The wedding excites her?

16:01.417 --> 16:04.715
- You wanted to tell her something.
- Yes.

16:06.722 --> 16:09.124
Tell her I am also...

16:12.830 --> 16:14.855
Goodbye.

16:14.931 --> 16:16.593
Goodbye, Sir Guy.

16:20.438 --> 16:25.206
"I will send for a physician."
He just killed one. He is revolting.

16:27.480 --> 16:31.576
- He killed one?
- Yes.

16:31.651 --> 16:33.586
Pitts.

16:36.423 --> 16:39.915
We thought he would denounce Gisborne.
But he was a traitor.

16:39.993 --> 16:42.861
He was also revolting.
I'm glad he is dead.

16:42.931 --> 16:44.991
Yeah, but she's got to marry Gisborne now.

16:45.067 --> 16:48.093
- Tomorrow.
- True.

16:50.607 --> 16:53.542
Marian, I will find another way out of this.

16:53.610 --> 16:55.908
Robin, I need to speak to you.

17:04.355 --> 17:06.415
Do you really have another
way out for Marian?

17:06.492 --> 17:08.117
I will think of something.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.388
If you cannot stop it,
then do not speak of it.

17:10.462 --> 17:13.900
Once Marian is married
it can never be undone.

17:13.968 --> 17:15.867
Then what is your plan?

17:18.472 --> 17:21.305
Edward, I will think of something.

17:21.375 --> 17:24.675
No. That is not good enough.

17:24.746 --> 17:28.079
You will raise Marian's hopes
only to see them dashed.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.517
If you care about her, spare her that.

17:30.586 --> 17:34.182
If you cannot save her, I beg you,
do the right thing. Let her go.

17:36.126 --> 17:38.287
Do you know something?

17:40.163 --> 17:44.156
I am sick of doing the right thing.

17:47.872 --> 17:49.840
Robin.

17:49.908 --> 17:52.104
I need your help.

17:52.177 --> 17:54.475
Robin.

18:02.423 --> 18:04.391
I knew you'd be here.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.392
It is my village.

18:13.369 --> 18:16.099
Remember the times
we used to sit up here?

18:17.806 --> 18:21.744
Sit up here and say there was
no finer place in England.

18:23.446 --> 18:25.472
Gisborne is stealing my life.

18:28.586 --> 18:30.645
Then you must let him.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.921
You heard Edward.

18:36.996 --> 18:39.260
The King is in danger.

18:40.666 --> 18:42.657
What is Locksley
if England can't be saved?

18:42.735 --> 18:46.002
At this moment I care more
about Locksley than England.

18:47.140 --> 18:49.165
It isn't Locksley, is it?

18:50.210 --> 18:51.406
It's Marian.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.210
We must let her go.

18:59.289 --> 19:01.314
I say "we". I mean you.

19:04.461 --> 19:06.190
There must be a way.

19:06.830 --> 19:09.197
Robin, the King is coming back.

19:09.934 --> 19:12.494
And if we can stop the Sheriff
from messing things up,

19:12.570 --> 19:14.299
then England will be right again.

19:15.139 --> 19:17.541
- Will it?
- Yes.

19:17.610 --> 19:21.739
The Sheriff will be out. You'll be in.

19:21.813 --> 19:26.410
We're talking days, surely.
I mean, you'll have your lands back.

19:27.587 --> 19:29.613
You'll be in Locksley,

19:30.591 --> 19:33.288
I'll be in Bonchurch.

19:33.361 --> 19:35.795
It's not a huge estate but it's big enough.

19:36.664 --> 19:39.394
A man could easily get lost on it. Easily.

19:42.338 --> 19:43.828
You know something?

19:43.906 --> 19:45.840
If you want to get lost...

19:47.177 --> 19:49.078
why don't you start practicing now?

19:52.449 --> 19:54.440
You don't mean that.

19:57.923 --> 20:02.417
A smaller man would be offended.
A smaller man would be wounded.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.689
You see, there is no smaller man, Much.

20:05.799 --> 20:08.734
You are the smaller man.

20:08.802 --> 20:13.763
All you care about is the roof
over your head, the food in your belly.

20:14.742 --> 20:18.200
You speak every facile thought
that comes into your head.

20:20.615 --> 20:22.777
You're like a pox on my skin.

20:24.687 --> 20:29.284
I keep scratching but you never go away.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.295
You go away!

21:06.167 --> 21:08.363
Marian.

21:08.437 --> 21:11.339
What is happening with Merton
and the other nobles?

21:11.407 --> 21:14.376
They are ready, making preparations.

21:14.444 --> 21:17.243
- Will you get word to the King?
- If we can.

21:17.314 --> 21:20.216
If not, we will protect him
as he arrives in Nottingham.

21:20.285 --> 21:22.048
It is so dangerous.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.782
Any move against the Sheriff,
if you were to be caught...

21:26.391 --> 21:28.291
I have waited too long, Marian.

21:28.360 --> 21:31.797
- And Robin?
- What of him?

21:31.863 --> 21:34.731
He used to be in charge
of the King's Private Guard.

21:34.800 --> 21:37.633
- He will assist you.
- I think not.

21:37.703 --> 21:40.696
- Why?
- He wants to stop your wedding.

21:43.444 --> 21:45.537
- He cannot.
- I have told him.

21:49.785 --> 21:52.117
Do you believe
Gisborne went to the Holy Land?

21:53.255 --> 21:56.156
Tried to kill the King? Attacked Robin?

21:57.227 --> 21:58.990
I do not know what to believe anymore.

22:00.830 --> 22:02.889
- Will you take me to him?
- Robin?

22:02.967 --> 22:05.595
No, Gisborne. I need to ask him.

22:11.577 --> 22:14.376
Get out and scour the country
for the Nightwatchman.

22:14.447 --> 22:16.711
I want him found by sunset.

22:19.285 --> 22:22.016
- Marian.
- I am quite well.

22:22.089 --> 22:25.423
Er, a robbery. A small thing.

22:25.492 --> 22:28.689
But I've taken extra precautions.
You're entirely safe.

22:28.762 --> 22:31.288
I hope you have not lost anything important.

22:31.366 --> 22:32.766
I'll get it back.

22:38.809 --> 22:41.107
Sir Guy, I must ask you a difficult question.

22:41.178 --> 22:42.668
I'm intrigued.

22:43.746 --> 22:46.444
Did you try and kill the King
in the Holy Land?

22:47.719 --> 22:50.153
- Pardon?
- Is it true?

22:51.122 --> 22:54.354
That last year you were not
in quarantine with a fever

22:54.426 --> 22:58.362
but that you traveled to the Holy Land,
you and others dressed as Saracens,

22:58.430 --> 23:00.330
and tried to kill the King?

23:02.536 --> 23:05.403
- Robin Hood.
- What of him?

23:05.473 --> 23:07.566
Been talking to him?

23:07.641 --> 23:11.079
This is a rumor which has been circulating
and I need an answer.

23:12.114 --> 23:14.479
I could not marry you if it were true.

23:14.549 --> 23:17.382
Rumors, Marian.

23:19.355 --> 23:24.418
You need to be more careful
who you listen to.

23:26.897 --> 23:31.267
The day the King returns
is a day of joy for me.

23:31.336 --> 23:34.669
- It is the day that I marry you.
- I am not sure.

23:35.874 --> 23:38.365
Well, you must be sure.

23:39.779 --> 23:42.441
- But...
- Have you not seen what you do to me?

23:43.784 --> 23:46.412
My passion for you?

23:53.928 --> 23:56.795
I have never felt like this before.

23:56.864 --> 23:58.331
- I must go.
- Stay.

23:58.399 --> 24:03.599
- I must go.
- Not until you tell me you believe me.

24:04.406 --> 24:06.374
I believe you.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.631
How are you feeling?

24:29.335 --> 24:31.896
I've been to see Guy.

24:31.972 --> 24:33.371
I've challenged him.

24:34.408 --> 24:36.377
And let me guess.

24:37.678 --> 24:43.312
You asked him if he was a traitor,
he said he wasn't and you believed him.

24:43.385 --> 24:45.854
Yes.

24:48.257 --> 24:49.885
I think you've been wrong about him.

24:49.960 --> 24:54.294
No. Trust me. I've been right about him.

24:54.364 --> 24:57.357
Maybe the difference between you and he
is not so huge.

24:58.669 --> 25:00.637
And isn't that your thesis?

25:02.006 --> 25:04.874
- Isn't that the Robin Hood world view?
- What thesis?

25:04.943 --> 25:07.434
That one man is much like another.

25:07.513 --> 25:11.176
That the poor are no different
from the wealthy and just as deserving.

25:11.250 --> 25:13.515
Why can't you apply your
charitable principles

25:13.587 --> 25:16.146
to somebody who's been deprived
in a different way?

25:16.222 --> 25:18.316
Deprived of love.

25:19.460 --> 25:22.521
Deprived of love.

25:32.175 --> 25:34.143
The Nightwatchman.

25:39.349 --> 25:41.010
This is goodbye, Robin.

25:42.520 --> 25:46.752
It's time for us to both grow up
and accept our lot in life.

25:47.960 --> 25:51.896
- Are you marrying him?
- I am marrying him.

25:53.499 --> 25:55.627
- Very well.
- Pardon?

25:55.702 --> 25:59.331
You said grow up and I'm growing up.

26:01.776 --> 26:03.745
Robin, where are you going?

26:09.751 --> 26:11.776
Arms. What about weapons?

26:11.854 --> 26:15.951
We will make sure all our men are armed
under their cloaks.

26:16.025 --> 26:18.688
I will alert the King's Private Guard
as best I can.

26:18.762 --> 26:22.562
I am anxious.
What if the Sheriff is planning...

26:22.633 --> 26:26.661
Remember, the Sheriff
will try to kill the King tomorrow.

26:26.737 --> 26:30.230
We will have the King's Private Guard
on our side.

26:30.308 --> 26:33.745
And not just that.
We will have right on our side.

26:33.813 --> 26:35.337
Justice.

26:35.414 --> 26:37.814
My lords, we have been biding our time
for too long.

26:48.429 --> 26:51.694
We are Robin Hood's men,
here to protect the King.

26:51.766 --> 26:53.734
Let them in. They are Robin's men.

26:53.801 --> 26:57.239
We can trust them.
Much served the King in Antioch.

26:57.307 --> 26:59.537
Welcome, Much. Robin is not with you?

26:59.609 --> 27:03.670
Robin is... by himself.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.477
There is no Robin.

27:43.626 --> 27:48.496
- Master? About your family.
- I have no family, Thornton.

27:49.867 --> 27:51.767
Thornton.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.440
Are you married?

27:56.508 --> 27:58.702
Alas, my wife has died, sir.

27:59.545 --> 28:01.569
Did she understand you?

28:01.647 --> 28:06.311
I... think so, sir. Yes.

28:07.621 --> 28:12.184
- That is the thing, to be understood.
- Yes, indeed, sir.

28:15.831 --> 28:19.598
- I have committed crimes.
- Really?

28:22.338 --> 28:24.669
Heinous crimes.

28:26.410 --> 28:32.211
But by taking Marian in holy wedlock...
I will wash away those crimes.

28:34.919 --> 28:39.855
Her pure heart... will cleanse mine.

29:10.760 --> 29:13.854
- Be careful.
- I will.

29:49.672 --> 29:53.507
I hope the decorations... the church...
please you.

29:53.576 --> 29:54.543
They do.

29:55.446 --> 29:58.176
- I hope I please you.
- You should not be here.

29:59.783 --> 30:01.012
Who should be here?

30:01.085 --> 30:04.282
You should be inside the church
waiting for me.

30:04.355 --> 30:07.382
Oh. Forgive me, I was unaware.

30:07.459 --> 30:10.223
- Have you never been to a wedding?
- No.

30:10.295 --> 30:12.321
Well, wait inside for me.

30:18.004 --> 30:19.973
Marian.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.406
I have dreamed of this day.

30:23.511 --> 30:24.478
Go.

30:28.450 --> 30:29.884
Sir Edward?

30:29.951 --> 30:32.716
He was needed on business.
He sends his apologies.

30:32.789 --> 30:35.314
What?

30:38.228 --> 30:40.196
Nothing.

31:07.261 --> 31:10.526
This is strange, the gang without Robin.

31:10.599 --> 31:15.968
It's fine.
He's made his decision. It's fine.

31:17.373 --> 31:19.238
What are you doing?

31:21.477 --> 31:24.936
There 's something I have to do.
I must find Robin.

31:26.650 --> 31:28.811
Come on. It's up to us.

31:57.987 --> 31:59.955
Majesty.

32:01.924 --> 32:07.022
Ha! Whoa! Your Majesty, welcome home.

32:07.097 --> 32:08.997
Wait!

32:11.801 --> 32:13.394
I'm Much.

32:13.471 --> 32:16.635
I fought in the King's Guard. I'm...
Your Ma...!

32:30.257 --> 32:31.690
Edward.

32:32.760 --> 32:34.728
Marian.

32:59.323 --> 33:01.258
Your Majesty.

33:03.929 --> 33:06.922
Welcome to Nottinghamshire,
the King's own county.

33:06.999 --> 33:09.901
We are glad to be back on English soil.

33:09.970 --> 33:11.801
I'm sure we are.

33:18.447 --> 33:20.414
My loyal subjects...

33:21.549 --> 33:24.178
we have survived the Holy Land

33:25.319 --> 33:30.657
and we are grateful
for your warm welcome.

33:31.828 --> 33:37.859
However, there are those amongst us
who are disloyal,

33:39.937 --> 33:42.406
who would plot against authority,

33:43.275 --> 33:47.837
who do not understand law and order.

33:50.383 --> 33:52.614
We must quash them now.

33:59.193 --> 34:00.854
Arrest Sheriff Vaizey.

34:02.230 --> 34:04.892
- Me?
- Take him to the dungeons.

34:04.966 --> 34:08.902
Me? Me? Blithering oaf! Me, arrested?

34:08.971 --> 34:12.498
Arrest all of them. Idiotic buffoon!

34:43.744 --> 34:49.012
Good subjects, we must judge the Sheriff
according to law.

34:49.083 --> 34:54.647
In such a case we shall hear French evidence.

34:54.724 --> 34:58.387
French evidence? What?

34:58.462 --> 35:01.897
Walter Lord of Merton.

35:32.700 --> 35:35.135
Walter, Lord of Merton,

35:35.204 --> 35:38.696
go left, à gauche,
to give evidence for the Sheriff,

35:38.774 --> 35:43.269
go right, à droit,
to give evidence against the Sheriff.

35:49.353 --> 35:51.754
Do you wish to give evidence
against the Sheriff?

35:51.823 --> 35:52.949
I do.

35:53.425 --> 35:57.827
Good. God save the King.

36:00.100 --> 36:01.226
Oh!

36:04.203 --> 36:07.970
Stop the wedding! Stop the wedding!

36:10.578 --> 36:14.605
Stop the wedding! It's not the King!

36:14.682 --> 36:16.844
The King is an impostor!

36:16.919 --> 36:19.820
The King is not in Nottingham!

36:19.888 --> 36:24.326
Whether the King is in Nottingham or not,
that has no bearing on a wedding.

36:24.394 --> 36:28.262
- Did you know this?
- The priest is right.

36:28.331 --> 36:30.322
This makes no difference. Our happiness...

36:30.400 --> 36:33.394
You lied to me.
What else have you lied about?

36:33.471 --> 36:36.565
He went to the Holy Land!
He tried to kill the King!

36:36.641 --> 36:40.577
I have done wrong
but you will wash away my sins.

36:40.645 --> 36:41.908
If it is not the King?

36:41.981 --> 36:44.848
It is a ruse by the Sheriff
to flush out his enemies.

36:44.917 --> 36:48.011
What will happen to them?

36:48.922 --> 36:50.822
My father. I must go to Nottingham.

36:50.891 --> 36:53.451
Your father will be safe.
I have made provision.

36:53.527 --> 36:57.089
You see? My influence, it benefits you.

36:57.165 --> 36:59.293
As my father-in-law, he is protected.

36:59.867 --> 37:01.926
As my father-in-law.

37:02.003 --> 37:04.131
- You are cruel.
- This is wrong!

37:04.673 --> 37:08.439
You must have legal grounds to object
or remain silent.

37:08.510 --> 37:10.570
- I have moral grounds.
- Get him out of here!

37:10.647 --> 37:16.712
This man is a traitor and a liar!
Is that legal?

37:16.787 --> 37:19.915
And her heart belongs to another!

37:23.929 --> 37:25.191
Let her tell you that.

37:28.500 --> 37:33.701
Marian, my lady, tell them.

37:36.610 --> 37:40.944
Yes, Marian, tell them.

37:41.782 --> 37:43.773
Remember your father.

37:46.122 --> 37:49.614
It is not true. I am sorry.

37:49.692 --> 37:53.857
I know you mean well
but my heart belongs here.

37:55.198 --> 37:59.157
- Get on with it.
- What? I don't understand!

37:59.236 --> 38:02.571
This is surely some mistake!

38:03.374 --> 38:05.639
You have a ring?

38:05.710 --> 38:08.838
He needs you, Marian!

38:10.917 --> 38:14.352
Wise decision. In time you will thank me.

38:14.420 --> 38:16.218
Aah!

38:23.864 --> 38:26.231
No, the left hand.
The ring must go on the left hand.

38:26.301 --> 38:28.496
No, the right is better.

38:37.981 --> 38:41.975
Do you take this man and this horse
as your route out of here?

38:42.053 --> 38:43.680
I do.

38:57.570 --> 39:00.699
Master! T he King!

39:00.774 --> 39:03.869
It's not the King! He's an impostor!

39:03.945 --> 39:06.277
A trap. I knew it.

39:06.347 --> 39:08.941
- Who's there?
- Everyone.

39:09.016 --> 39:11.349
- The gang.
- Robin, my father.

39:11.420 --> 39:13.445
He leads the rebellion.

39:25.369 --> 39:29.271
Former Sheriff,
Edward of Knighton.

39:29.340 --> 39:31.969
- Tell it how it is, Edward.
- I will.

39:38.818 --> 39:40.945
We can catch her for you, sir.

39:47.461 --> 39:49.430
No.

39:51.231 --> 39:52.756
Let her go.

40:10.487 --> 40:15.756
Lord Knighton, go left, à gauche,
to give evidence for the Sheriff,

40:15.828 --> 40:21.233
go right, à droit,
to give evidence against the Sheriff.

40:25.705 --> 40:28.174
- We can't be seen together.
- We'd never get in anyway.

40:28.242 --> 40:31.405
- I'll try the east gate.
- We'll try the west.

40:35.350 --> 40:38.649
- Marian!
- Robin!

41:12.826 --> 41:14.794
Much.

41:18.366 --> 41:22.599
Climbing. You know I hate climbing.

41:39.490 --> 41:43.518
Do you wish to give evidence
against the Sheriff?

41:48.267 --> 41:51.237
A clue, no.

41:53.873 --> 41:55.968
Help! Help!

42:02.550 --> 42:05.418
It's a trap! It's a trap!

42:05.487 --> 42:07.580
This is not the King!

42:07.656 --> 42:09.453
Arrest that impostor!

42:09.525 --> 42:11.652
I knew this smelt funny.

42:11.728 --> 42:13.923
- Get him.
- Run!

42:17.834 --> 42:19.495
It's not funny.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.701
No.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.907
Shall we leave?

42:29.982 --> 42:33.008
- Thought we were out of a job.
- Good to have you back.

42:33.086 --> 42:34.644
It's good to be back.

42:35.955 --> 42:38.049
Robin!

42:38.125 --> 42:40.093
Not so fast, my friend.

42:41.328 --> 42:43.694
Sorry to burst your bubble, Hood,

42:43.764 --> 42:47.223
but I'm sure you know how this goes, hm?

42:47.302 --> 42:48.462
Hands up.

42:49.270 --> 42:52.536
- Spoilt my game, Hood. Tut-tut.
- John, catch!

43:14.633 --> 43:17.034
Everybody still, if you please.

43:20.173 --> 43:22.141
I think we can safely say

43:22.208 --> 43:23.869
an audience with the King...

43:24.979 --> 43:26.379
has been suspended.

43:29.985 --> 43:33.149
Come on, lads. Let's go home.

43:34.824 --> 43:35.882
Come back!

43:35.958 --> 43:38.449
Get me down from here, you blithering oafs!

43:45.135 --> 43:46.291
Yeah!

43:47.305 --> 43:53.891
