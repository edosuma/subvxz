WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:04.429
Twenty-eight.
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

00:04.713 --> 00:06.848
Twenty-nive.
Oh, it burns.

00:06.882 --> 00:07.942
Whew!

00:08.768 --> 00:09.851
Thirty.

00:09.885 --> 00:12.887
- Hoo!
- You are lucky she can't count,

00:12.921 --> 00:14.689
'cause I'm pretty sure
that was three.

00:15.757 --> 00:18.659
Hey, don't hate, okay?

00:18.694 --> 00:20.661
Emma is
the perfect workout.

00:20.696 --> 00:22.864
As she bulks up,
so do I.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.665
Okay.

00:24.700 --> 00:27.635
Well, if your goal is to be able
bench your own body weight,

00:27.669 --> 00:29.069
it looks like
you're right on track.

00:30.005 --> 00:32.006
Oh yeah!
Gentlemen,

00:32.040 --> 00:36.577
the god of fun and irresponsible
behavior is smiling down upon us.

00:36.612 --> 00:38.579
Ye, we got that when
he dropped off your baby.

00:39.915 --> 00:42.917
No. We're having a party!

00:42.951 --> 00:44.919
Yes! Finally!

00:44.953 --> 00:47.655
You've been promising me a party
ever since I moved in here!

00:47.689 --> 00:48.990
And it is gonna be epic.

00:49.024 --> 00:51.692
Nobody throws a cooler,
wilder, crazier party

00:51.727 --> 00:53.027
- than we do.
- What is wrong with you?

00:53.061 --> 00:55.696
You know we can't have  aparty here
after that last one.

00:56.231 --> 00:57.865
I woke up in the alley.

00:58.900 --> 01:01.602
I wanna wake up
in the alley!

01:01.637 --> 01:03.104
No, I meant "we can't,"

01:03.138 --> 01:06.741
as in "that's what the large legal
document nailed to our front door said."

01:06.775 --> 01:08.776
If we have another party
in this apartment,

01:08.810 --> 01:10.978
- we are out.
- The key word is "this apartment."

01:11.013 --> 01:13.581
And the other key word
is "key"...

01:14.432 --> 01:15.683
 ...as in this one

01:15.717 --> 01:16.984
to Apartment 4C!

01:19.755 --> 01:21.722
- Isn't it vacant?
- Exactly.

01:21.757 --> 01:23.691
And our dear,
sweet landlord,

01:23.725 --> 01:25.860
sir hairy-back lazy-ass,

01:26.394 --> 01:28.996
has been leaving the key under
the mat for prospective tenants.

01:29.031 --> 01:30.898
So until somebody moves in--

01:30.933 --> 01:33.601
which we will all make sure
never happens--

01:33.635 --> 01:35.803
we have ourselves
a party space.

01:35.837 --> 01:36.971
Yes!

01:37.005 --> 01:38.573
Mmm!

01:38.607 --> 01:41.542
Hi, boys. Ooh!
Is that the key to 4C?

01:41.577 --> 01:43.878
- Thanks.
- Mom.

01:44.912 --> 01:46.614
Wh-- what are you doing?

01:46.648 --> 01:48.783
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm moving in.

01:50.586 --> 01:52.720
Oh, this is perfect!

01:54.056 --> 01:55.790
- Mom, I don't think it's such a good idea.
- Mom, no no no.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.558
Can we talk about this? I don't
think it's a great idea.

01:57.593 --> 01:59.727
Where's your god
of fun now? Huh?

02:02.598 --> 02:05.733

02:12.608 --> 02:14.842
Good morning, New York!

02:14.876 --> 02:17.511
It's me, Bonnie Wheeler!

02:17.546 --> 02:18.546
<i>Shut up!</i>

02:18.580 --> 02:19.947
No, you shut up!

02:23.785 --> 02:25.686
Oh, look at me,

02:25.721 --> 02:27.855
single gal in the city.

02:27.889 --> 02:29.857
Oh, it is time
to shake up my life

02:29.891 --> 02:32.927
and unleash "New Bonnie"
into the world.

02:32.961 --> 02:35.663
Mom, "unleash" is what
super-villains do

02:35.697 --> 02:38.833
with things like plagues
and death rays.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.601
Never ends well.

02:41.637 --> 02:42.670
This bachelorette pad
is missing

02:42.704 --> 02:43.738
only one thing--

02:43.772 --> 02:44.972
Bachelors.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.842
Riley, I can't
thank you enough

02:47.876 --> 02:49.577
for helping me
find this place.

02:51.780 --> 02:54.582
You told her
about this place?

02:54.616 --> 02:55.916
How could you
do that to me?

02:55.951 --> 02:59.587
Oh, I'm sorry. Is it awkward
having your mother so close?

02:59.621 --> 03:00.788
Because you sure didn't think so
when you dumped her

03:00.822 --> 03:03.758
at my place for
the last two weeks.

03:03.792 --> 03:06.694
It was funnier when I did it.

03:06.728 --> 03:07.862
It's called payback,
Ben.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.530
And at least now
I don't have to keep saying

03:09.564 --> 03:11.732
"Quit going through my things
or trying on my stuff."

03:11.767 --> 03:13.934
Hey, have you seen my
little pink jewelry box?

03:13.969 --> 03:15.603
It had Nana's good ring
in it.

03:15.637 --> 03:16.971
Oh, no.
Sorry, haven't seen it.

03:19.608 --> 03:21.842
You have to help me
get this off.

03:21.877 --> 03:23.844
Why are you wearing
Nana's ring?

03:23.879 --> 03:26.580
I was going through her things
and trying on her stuff.

03:27.716 --> 03:28.749
Hey, Riley,
just let me know if

03:28.784 --> 03:29.944
you see it back
at your place.

03:29.951 --> 03:32.620
Oh, and I'm also missing
those little blue earrings.

03:32.654 --> 03:33.934
- Those are mine.
- Worth a shot.

03:35.991 --> 03:37.525
Well, I should
probably go.

03:37.559 --> 03:38.559
I have a date with Fitch.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.628
I thought Dr. save-the-world

03:40.662 --> 03:41.929
flew back to Africa
last week.

03:41.963 --> 03:44.532
It's our daily video chat.

03:44.566 --> 03:46.600
And on the bright side, when your
boyfriend lives 6,000 miles away,

03:46.635 --> 03:48.669
you only have to look cute
from the neck up.

03:50.571 --> 03:51.839
This is not right, man.

03:51.873 --> 03:53.507
She cannot live here.

03:53.542 --> 03:55.910
So either you man up
and tell her to get out,

03:55.944 --> 03:57.778
or I will.

03:57.813 --> 03:59.880
Oh, hey, Mrs. Wheeler.
How you doin'?

04:01.516 --> 04:03.751
Let me know if there is
anything else you need.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.520
Oh! Thanks, Tucker.

04:06.555 --> 04:09.557
You're like the little
pocket-sized son I never had.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.660
Mom, we have
to have a talk.

04:12.694 --> 04:14.662
Look, Benji, I know
what you're gonna say.

04:14.696 --> 04:16.930
And if I'm being too
intrusive, just tell me.

04:16.964 --> 04:18.466
You're being too intrusive.

04:18.500 --> 04:19.800
Oh, come on.

04:19.834 --> 04:21.869
It's gonna be fun, huh?

04:21.903 --> 04:23.804
And I think you might
have forgotten

04:23.839 --> 04:26.707
how much fun your mom
is to have around.

04:26.742 --> 04:28.476
What!

04:31.713 --> 04:33.848
Wow!

04:33.882 --> 04:36.650
That was a blood bath.

04:36.685 --> 04:38.619
You really told her.

04:38.653 --> 04:39.954
I don't have to,

04:39.988 --> 04:42.623
because there's one thing
she's obviously forgotten.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.859
How much fun <i>I</i> am
to have around.

04:46.828 --> 04:47.895
<i>That reminds me,</i>

04:47.929 --> 04:50.698
the most amazing Sushi place
just opened up on third.

04:50.732 --> 04:52.633
Whoo! Listen to me
go on.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.969
You're not gonna forget me while I'm gone, are you?

04:55.003 --> 04:57.872
No. I truly only have eyes...

04:57.906 --> 05:00.474
For you.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.445
You. I-- I only
have eyes for you.

05:04.479 --> 05:06.680
Um, I gotta get back.

05:06.715 --> 05:07.681
I miss you.

05:07.716 --> 05:08.916
♪ Miss you too.

05:09.950 --> 05:10.918
Fitch.

05:11.952 --> 05:12.820
So...

05:12.854 --> 05:15.723
Other than not doing laundry,
what's been going on?

05:16.958 --> 05:18.793
Don't answer that.

05:19.895 --> 05:21.829
You know what
I just realized?

05:21.863 --> 05:23.597
This might be the first
time we've both been

05:23.632 --> 05:25.499
in relationships
at the same time.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.568
I mean, you with Milena;

05:27.602 --> 05:28.602
Me with Fitch.

05:28.637 --> 05:32.706
Who would look lovely
feeding me muffins or...

05:32.741 --> 05:35.843
Fried larva or whatever
it is he has for breakfast.

05:36.877 --> 05:38.746
Yeah, it's nice,
isn't it?

05:38.780 --> 05:41.515
Quick shower.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.884
You wait,
my little Dannichka.

05:50.592 --> 05:52.693
You have to help me
break up with Milena.

05:53.227 --> 05:56.730
What? Why?
You're her little Dannichka.

05:57.765 --> 05:58.899
She's getting too serious.

05:59.434 --> 06:01.702
I mean, I like her,
but I'm not ready to commit.

06:01.736 --> 06:02.736
And I don't wanna
lead her on.

06:02.771 --> 06:04.672
So can't you just
talk to her?

06:04.706 --> 06:06.774
I've tried, but there's
something about her.

06:06.808 --> 06:08.776
It's like she has
these powers.

06:08.810 --> 06:10.511
Powers?

06:10.545 --> 06:12.780
Like making your clothes
disappear?

06:12.814 --> 06:14.448
No.

06:14.483 --> 06:15.850
I start to say one thing,
then she kisses me,

06:15.884 --> 06:17.451
and I forget
what I'm talking about.

06:17.486 --> 06:19.620
Oh, how much more rational
men would be

06:19.654 --> 06:21.722
with just one extra
pint of blood.

06:23.458 --> 06:24.458
Will you help me?

06:24.493 --> 06:25.659
You've been dumped
a ton of times.

06:25.694 --> 06:26.827
Not that many times.

06:26.862 --> 06:28.729
Johnny, Teddy,

06:28.763 --> 06:31.432
- Big-hair Bobby--
- Okay, thank you. Point made.

06:31.466 --> 06:32.633
Hey, is that
my Nana's ring?

06:33.735 --> 06:34.869
How do you notice

06:34.903 --> 06:36.604
a little nondescript
diamond ring,

06:36.638 --> 06:38.472
and you didn't notice
that I cut my hair?

06:38.507 --> 06:40.641
Oh, yeah.
It looks really good.

06:40.675 --> 06:42.543
Two years ago.

06:44.846 --> 06:46.814
Wheeler, let's focus.

06:46.848 --> 06:49.617
My advice is you gotta
tell her the truth.

06:49.651 --> 06:51.685
And I think
the sooner the better.

06:52.721 --> 06:53.854
Danny?

06:53.889 --> 06:55.856
You want to join me
in shower?

06:56.891 --> 06:58.492
Sure.

07:00.762 --> 07:02.496
I think this will be
easier if I'm clean.

07:05.433 --> 07:07.568
<i>♪ well, I'm the new
Bonnie and I'm pleased to meet ya ♪</i>

07:07.602 --> 07:09.703
♪ you don't know how to party,
well, I'm here to teach ya. ♪

07:09.738 --> 07:11.472
Hey, Mom.

07:11.506 --> 07:12.706
Oh! Ben!

07:12.741 --> 07:14.575
Don't do that.

07:15.109 --> 07:16.510
I got called in
for an early shift,

07:16.545 --> 07:17.578
so you're gonna
have to watch Emma.

07:17.612 --> 07:19.847
And what
if I had plans?

07:19.881 --> 07:21.448
If you had what?

07:21.483 --> 07:24.451
Mom, you're hilarious.

07:24.486 --> 07:27.454
I happen to have
a very special date tonight.

07:27.489 --> 07:30.491
In fact, I just made him
my world-famous--

07:30.525 --> 07:33.427
is this my meatloaf?

07:33.461 --> 07:35.863
You should probably thank me.
It was a little dry.

07:36.897 --> 07:38.632
And how many times
have I told you

07:38.667 --> 07:41.402
not to drink
out of the carton?

07:41.436 --> 07:43.836
Guess we're just gonna have to
agree to disagree on that one.

07:44.806 --> 07:47.441
Okay, bye, baby.
Be good for Grandma.

07:47.475 --> 07:49.810
Oh, yeah, and I left
a couple shirts on the chair.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.478
Most of them
just need buttons,

07:51.513 --> 07:53.480
but one has a fresh
meatloaf stain.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.715
Hmm.

07:54.749 --> 07:56.717
And you're right.
I did forget how fun

07:56.751 --> 07:58.552
it is to have you around.

08:00.555 --> 08:02.523
<i>Milena, I swear...</i>

08:02.557 --> 08:04.558
It's not you, it's me.

08:04.593 --> 08:07.528
Yeah. No.

08:07.562 --> 08:08.643
What's wrong with that one?

08:08.663 --> 08:09.830
No woman likes to be
lied to.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.532
Plus, we already know
it's you,

08:11.566 --> 08:13.801
otherwise, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

08:13.835 --> 08:15.536
You know,
it's kinda hard to focus

08:15.570 --> 08:16.704
with your hand
in the air like that.

08:16.738 --> 08:18.639
It's like algebra class
all over again.

08:18.673 --> 08:21.642
"Oh oh!
Pick me, pick me!"

08:21.676 --> 08:24.378
Oh oh, well, you didn't seem to
mind that I had all the answers

08:24.412 --> 08:25.733
when you were copying
off my quiz.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.782
I just need
the swelling to go down.

08:28.817 --> 08:30.718
Oh! How about this?

08:30.752 --> 08:32.720
We can still be friends.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.460
Is something you say to someone
you never wanna be friends with.

08:40.761 --> 08:43.831
Oh, my God. I can move it.
Yes! A little soap.

08:43.865 --> 08:45.566
Danny, please help me
get this off.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.368
Milena's gonna be here
any minute,

08:47.402 --> 08:48.636
- and I still don't know what I'm gonna say.
- It's fine.

08:48.670 --> 08:50.404
Just be honest. You like her,
but you're not ready to commit.

08:50.438 --> 08:51.605
- Ow.
- Oh, got it!

08:51.640 --> 08:52.640
<i> Where did it go?</i>

08:52.674 --> 08:53.995
I think it rolled
under the couch.

08:57.479 --> 08:58.545
Oh, found it!

09:00.448 --> 09:01.715
Milena.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.385
Oh, my God.
Danny!

09:05.520 --> 09:07.755
Yes yes!
I will marry you!

09:10.525 --> 09:11.625
No. No no, Milena.

09:11.660 --> 09:13.727
- The ring is--
- The ring is perfect!

09:13.762 --> 09:15.729
I have to call my mother.

09:19.668 --> 09:21.402
<i>Mom?!</i>

09:23.571 --> 09:26.306
Well,
on the bright side...

09:26.341 --> 09:27.408
We got the ring off.

09:34.196 --> 09:35.363
What just happened?

09:35.897 --> 09:37.831
How could she think
I wanted to get married?

09:37.866 --> 09:39.833
I'm just guessing,
but it might have been

09:39.868 --> 09:41.768
the whole
on-bended-knee thing.

09:41.803 --> 09:43.537
We can't get married.

09:43.571 --> 09:45.606
I'm too young
to get married.

09:45.640 --> 09:46.940
Really?

09:46.975 --> 09:48.575
That's your takeaway
from this?

09:52.647 --> 09:55.849
Now remember,
what happens on the elevator...

09:55.884 --> 09:58.619
Stays on the elevator.

10:00.989 --> 10:02.656
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

10:03.892 --> 10:05.792
I can't believe it.
Look what Danny gave me.

10:05.827 --> 10:08.562
Milena! Hey! Don't
bother the nice lady.

10:08.596 --> 10:09.730
Come quick.
Danny needs to see you.

10:09.764 --> 10:11.465
- Hi, Mrs. Wheeler.
- <i>Hi.</i>

10:12.901 --> 10:15.602
Wow.
Really friendly building.

10:15.637 --> 10:17.938
That's one way to put it.

10:17.972 --> 10:20.474
Now I just want you
to know that you

10:20.508 --> 10:22.876
are the first official
visitor...

10:22.911 --> 10:23.944
To Bonnie town.

10:25.713 --> 10:28.548
You sure about that?

10:28.583 --> 10:29.683
Ben!

10:29.717 --> 10:31.718
- Hey, Mom.
- <i>Ohh.</i>

10:31.753 --> 10:33.487
Hey, Mrs. Wheeler.

10:33.521 --> 10:34.855
Looks like you're flying
first class tonight.

10:38.660 --> 10:39.960
Somebody's got herself
a layover.

10:41.796 --> 10:44.698
Dude, that's my mom.

10:45.732 --> 10:46.767
Boys,

10:46.801 --> 10:49.770
this is Jerry
and he's not a pilot.

10:49.804 --> 10:51.538
- He's a lieutenant...
- Captain.

10:51.572 --> 10:53.607
- ...in the Navy.
- Coast Guard.

10:53.641 --> 10:55.161
We're still getting
to know each other.

10:56.010 --> 10:59.680
So Jerry, why don't
you wait for me out

10:59.714 --> 11:02.616
on the terrace,
while I get us some wine

11:02.650 --> 11:04.785
and smother the children.

11:04.819 --> 11:06.486
Oh, yeah,
you're out of wine.

11:06.521 --> 11:07.688
And beer.

11:07.722 --> 11:09.756
But don't worry, I put
a list on the fridge.

11:10.959 --> 11:13.627
All right, what are
you two couch rats doing here?

11:13.661 --> 11:15.662
I told you
I had a date tonight.

11:15.697 --> 11:17.497
Oh!

11:17.532 --> 11:19.733
Was that tonight? Pfft!

11:19.767 --> 11:22.736
I've gotta learn
to write stuff down.

11:22.770 --> 11:25.739
Well, let me fill you in
on what's happened so far.

11:25.773 --> 11:28.809
Dinner? You ate it.
Night cap? You drank it.

11:28.843 --> 11:30.644
Good night kiss?
Not happening

11:30.678 --> 11:32.813
unless you two
get the hell of of here!

11:32.847 --> 11:34.648
- I'm in no hurry.
- Well, I am.

11:34.682 --> 11:35.782
Have you seen yourself?

11:38.753 --> 11:41.722
Seriously, Ben, you've got
two seconds to get out--

11:42.857 --> 11:45.492
Sweet! Pizza's here.

11:45.526 --> 11:46.626
Hey, Mom.
Can I borrow 20 bucks?

11:46.661 --> 11:47.828
- I'll totally pay you back.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

11:47.862 --> 11:50.664
It's not the first time
you've stolen my twenties.

11:50.698 --> 11:52.599
And thirties.

11:54.535 --> 11:56.803
All right, you,
fun-size, out.

11:58.539 --> 11:59.506
Calm down!

11:59.540 --> 12:00.607
I can take a hint.

12:00.641 --> 12:02.876
I know what you're trying
to do, Ben Wheeler.

12:02.910 --> 12:04.544
And you can just forget it.

12:04.579 --> 12:06.780
You are not going to
extinguish the radiant light

12:06.814 --> 12:09.583
that is New Bonnie.

12:09.617 --> 12:12.519
I can't believe
you'd think I'd do that.

12:12.553 --> 12:13.787
I'm so insulted.

12:15.523 --> 12:17.824
However, if this isn't
working out for you,

12:17.859 --> 12:19.793
you're on month-to-month,
right?

12:19.827 --> 12:21.862
Okay, when I get back,

12:21.896 --> 12:24.798
you and I are going
to have a serious conversation

12:24.832 --> 12:25.932
about boundaries.

12:25.967 --> 12:27.801
Wait. Get back from where?

12:27.835 --> 12:29.536
Well, some of the old neighbors
are throwing me

12:29.570 --> 12:31.471
a going-away party
tomorrow night.

12:31.506 --> 12:33.640
As a joke, they're calling it
a "good riddance" party.

12:34.809 --> 12:37.744
Which is exactly
what I am saying to you.

12:42.717 --> 12:44.518
I don't think
this is working.

12:44.552 --> 12:45.852
She is not
moving out.

12:45.887 --> 12:47.687
I wouldn't be too sure.

12:47.722 --> 12:49.589
Come on, man.
You heard her.

12:49.624 --> 12:50.724
Really?

12:50.758 --> 12:51.892
'Cause all I heard was

12:51.926 --> 12:54.795
the god of fun
and irresponsible behavior

12:54.829 --> 12:56.730
is back.

12:56.764 --> 12:59.633
Dude, we're having a party.

13:04.772 --> 13:06.440
Say "Aloha."

13:06.474 --> 13:07.607
Aloha!

13:07.642 --> 13:09.609
Oh.

13:09.644 --> 13:10.677
Aloha.

13:10.711 --> 13:12.546
Come here, girl.
How you doin'?

13:12.580 --> 13:13.880
What do you think, Emma?

13:13.915 --> 13:16.483
This is what we call
a party.

13:16.517 --> 13:18.919
Someday you'll grow up
and trash daddy's place,

13:18.953 --> 13:21.655
and the circle of life
will be complete.

13:21.689 --> 13:23.590
I actually get
kinda teary-eyed

13:23.624 --> 13:25.024
just thinking about it.

13:27.929 --> 13:28.929
Wow!

13:28.963 --> 13:30.530
I think I just
melted my teeth.

13:31.666 --> 13:32.799
You gotta try this, man.

13:32.834 --> 13:35.569
Sounds great,
but I can't.

13:35.603 --> 13:36.903
I'm designated daddy tonight.

13:36.938 --> 13:38.538
Plus, I need to make sure
things don't get

13:38.573 --> 13:39.706
too out of control.

13:42.977 --> 13:46.480
Okay okay. If people can
just leave the furniture

13:46.514 --> 13:47.547
where they found it.

13:48.683 --> 13:49.950
Hey, bro!
Amazing party.

13:49.984 --> 13:52.519
Too bad I'm about to be
an only child.

13:52.553 --> 13:53.854
Yeah, I know.

13:53.888 --> 13:55.956
- I didn't mean for it to get this wild.
- Don't worry.

13:55.990 --> 13:57.891
I won't let Emma forget you.

13:57.925 --> 13:59.659
You have to help me
shut this down.

13:59.694 --> 14:01.528
It's way too late for that.

14:01.562 --> 14:03.530
What do you mean?
It's not too late.

14:03.564 --> 14:06.800
Benjamin Bon Jovi Wheeler!

14:06.834 --> 14:09.769
Bonnie!

14:09.804 --> 14:11.838
It's too late!

14:11.873 --> 14:14.808
What the hell
is going on here?

14:14.842 --> 14:16.810
Whoo!

14:16.844 --> 14:17.811
Hey, everybody!

14:17.845 --> 14:19.813
Check out my fire dance!

14:21.000 --> 14:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:42.271 --> 14:44.038
Oh!

14:44.073 --> 14:46.140
Oh. Must you?

14:47.409 --> 14:49.995
It feels like an entire village
is running through my head,

14:50.029 --> 14:51.930
fleeing from
an erupting volcano.

14:53.799 --> 14:55.700
But just as
they reach the beach...

14:55.735 --> 14:56.835
Shark attack.

14:56.869 --> 14:58.149
Oh my God.

14:59.205 --> 15:03.108
- Whoo!
- Oh my God.

15:03.142 --> 15:05.110
I think I got
all the water up

15:05.144 --> 15:07.045
and I don't think there's
any real, permanent damage.

15:07.079 --> 15:10.015
Well, it's official...

15:10.049 --> 15:12.050
- Oh.
- Oh my...!

15:12.084 --> 15:15.120
At the ripe old age of...

15:16.956 --> 15:18.657
I'm homeless!

15:18.691 --> 15:20.792
They can't evict you.

15:20.826 --> 15:23.028
- Just tell 'Em it was my fault.
- Oh, no, Ben,

15:23.062 --> 15:26.698
I can't do that, because
then Emma would be homeless.

15:26.732 --> 15:31.002
I mean, what was so horribly bad
about me living across the hall?!

15:31.037 --> 15:32.103
I'm a delight!

15:34.807 --> 15:37.842
Yeah, I cannot believe that you did
all of this just to get rid of me!

15:37.877 --> 15:39.844
I guess
I just wanted my space!

15:41.080 --> 15:42.814
Which, now that
I say it out loud,

15:42.848 --> 15:44.115
sounds kind of selfish.

15:44.150 --> 15:47.052
Well, congratulations,
you've got your space now.

15:47.086 --> 15:48.853
She's gonna slam it again, isn't she?

15:48.888 --> 15:51.756
Yeah, and harder this time!

15:53.192 --> 15:55.060
Next time I have
a brilliant idea,

15:55.094 --> 15:57.128
someone remind me
that I'm an idiot.

15:57.163 --> 16:00.699
Okay okay, new rule:

16:00.733 --> 16:03.702
Nobody else speak
until further notice.

16:03.736 --> 16:04.869
Good morning!

16:04.904 --> 16:07.772
You were so funny
last night, Tucker.

16:07.807 --> 16:10.942
Hoo-wah!

16:10.976 --> 16:12.844
Danny, get dressed.
We have a lot to do today.

16:15.047 --> 16:17.916
- Help me.
- No. No!

16:17.950 --> 16:19.651
I am done helping you.

16:19.685 --> 16:21.052
You obviously want
this relationship,

16:21.087 --> 16:22.887
because if you didn't,
you would've put a stop to it.

16:22.922 --> 16:25.090
So either up the testosterone
or quit whining.

16:26.826 --> 16:28.927
I meant that
in the nicest possible way.

16:30.763 --> 16:32.797
I've tried. It's like
she has me under a spell.

16:32.832 --> 16:34.933
She does not have you
under a spell.

16:34.967 --> 16:36.935
Yeah, I--

16:39.772 --> 16:41.072
Is everything okay?

16:43.943 --> 16:46.711
No. No, it's not.

16:46.746 --> 16:48.146
Take a seat.
We need to talk.

16:51.016 --> 16:52.984
Milena, I--

16:53.018 --> 16:54.819
what is it?

16:54.854 --> 16:57.856
Umm...

16:57.890 --> 17:00.792
You see...

17:00.826 --> 17:02.927
- There's this--
- Oh, for the love of God, Wheeler.

17:06.766 --> 17:08.800
I can't marry you, the whole
ring thing was an accident

17:08.834 --> 17:10.594
and I don't think
we're right for each other.

17:11.904 --> 17:13.872
And spell broken.

17:15.007 --> 17:17.942
Why? I don't understand.

17:17.977 --> 17:19.810
Is it because
the two of you are--

17:19.845 --> 17:21.112
Oh, us? No no.

17:21.146 --> 17:23.181
I was just using my powers
to help him focus.

17:24.817 --> 17:26.050
I'm sorry.
I know I should've told you

17:26.085 --> 17:28.887
- all this before.
- But what happened?

17:28.921 --> 17:31.055
I thought we were
so good together.

17:31.090 --> 17:32.924
We are.

17:32.958 --> 17:35.093
I'm just not ready
to make a commitment.

17:37.096 --> 17:39.798
And I'm not ready to be
with boy who cannot.

17:42.201 --> 17:44.169
We can still be friends.

17:47.773 --> 17:49.974
That's worse than
"it's not you, it's me."

17:51.210 --> 17:53.778
I actually tried
to tell him that.

17:55.714 --> 17:57.148
Hey, Mom.

17:57.683 --> 18:00.985
Don't worry. I've got people
coming to get the boxes.

18:01.020 --> 18:03.021
Fortunately, Aunt Shirley
is letting me stay

18:03.055 --> 18:04.923
in one side
of her double-wide.

18:05.457 --> 18:08.993
- Mom, I don't--
- You know what is so funny about this, Ben?

18:09.028 --> 18:11.796
You were my inspiration
to make this move!

18:12.531 --> 18:15.133
When I saw what
you did with your life

18:15.167 --> 18:18.036
when Emma came into it,
I thought, "I could do that!

18:18.070 --> 18:19.938
I could change, too!"

18:20.272 --> 18:23.141
But how can I be New Bonnie
when I'm stuck with old Ben?

18:24.977 --> 18:27.178
Wait.

18:28.631 --> 18:29.598
Oh, what's this?

18:30.633 --> 18:32.634
All of my squashed
hopes and dreams

18:32.668 --> 18:34.569
in a convenient
carrying case?

18:35.605 --> 18:36.905
It's a lease...

18:36.939 --> 18:39.507
For a nice apartment
around the corner.

18:39.542 --> 18:42.644
- Really?
- Look, I know what I did

18:42.678 --> 18:46.615
was selfish and immature--
not two of my best qualities--

18:47.783 --> 18:49.751
but I want to change.

18:49.785 --> 18:51.720
I wanna be the guy
you think I am,

18:51.754 --> 18:53.521
the guy you think
I can be.

18:54.657 --> 18:57.459
And this is my way
of saying that I'm sorry

18:57.493 --> 18:58.660
and I'm trying.

19:00.563 --> 19:02.631
You forgive me?

19:04.467 --> 19:06.368
Ben, I'm your mother.

19:07.503 --> 19:09.638
Forgiving you is
a full-time job.

19:12.441 --> 19:13.742
But it's one that I love.

19:18.447 --> 19:20.649
I think that is
a perfect example of why

19:20.683 --> 19:22.517
I am not cut out
for a relationship.

19:22.551 --> 19:23.818
Oh, that is so not true.

19:23.853 --> 19:25.420
I don't care
how much you protest,

19:25.454 --> 19:26.655
you are a relationship guy.

19:26.689 --> 19:27.756
Oh, you think so?

19:27.790 --> 19:29.491
Oh, I know so.

19:31.252 --> 19:32.552
Anyway...

19:33.596 --> 19:34.729
I'm sorry
that I had to drop

19:34.764 --> 19:36.698
that kiss bomb on you.

19:36.732 --> 19:39.467
Never apologize
for saving my life...

19:39.502 --> 19:40.702
Or kissing me.

19:43.406 --> 19:44.773
- Well, that didn't last long.
- What?

19:44.807 --> 19:47.475
Us both being in a
relationship at the same time.

19:47.510 --> 19:49.377
Oh. Yeah.

19:49.412 --> 19:52.514
Honestly, I don't know how much
longer I'm gonna be dating Fitch.

19:52.548 --> 19:53.815
Really? Why?

19:54.349 --> 19:55.684
Just a sense.

19:55.718 --> 19:58.553
Like, we haven't talked or
chatted in a couple of days now.

19:58.587 --> 20:00.455
I'm sure
he has a good reason.

20:00.489 --> 20:02.590
Oh, yeah?
And what would that be?

20:02.625 --> 20:04.492
He was travelling.

20:05.528 --> 20:07.429
Oh my God! Fitch!

20:07.463 --> 20:10.498
- Hi!
-  Hi.

20:10.533 --> 20:11.766
Oh.

20:11.801 --> 20:13.768
Oh, I missed you
so much.

20:13.803 --> 20:15.637
I just had
to come home to see you.

20:15.671 --> 20:17.772
Mmm!

20:21.977 --> 20:22.844
Yup.

20:23.178 --> 20:25.447
That girl has definitely
got some powers.

20:29.475 --> 20:30.309
Done!

20:30.393 --> 20:33.228
The last of Mom's boxes
have been safely delivered.

20:33.762 --> 20:36.798
And I think some people from the
luau are living in the elevator.

20:36.832 --> 20:39.267
Sounds like I missed
a pretty epic night.

20:39.352 --> 20:41.753
- I was actually engaged for most of it.
- Oh, that reminds me--

20:41.787 --> 20:43.588
I've got to get this ring back to your mom...

20:43.623 --> 20:45.323
...before she realizes
I was the one that took it.

20:46.792 --> 20:49.361
Hey, Mom.
Settling in okay?

20:50.179 --> 20:51.413
Yeah, hold on.
Let me ask her.

20:52.197 --> 20:55.233
Mom wants to know what
you're doing with Nana's ring.

20:55.267 --> 20:56.701
How did she know
that I have the ring?

20:56.785 --> 20:58.887
And, Danny, she says,
"Get your feet off the table."

21:00.506 --> 21:02.440
Where is your mom's
new apartment?

21:02.475 --> 21:05.276
Ben, what did you do?

21:06.445 --> 21:08.580
She can't read lips,
can she?

21:08.614 --> 21:10.281
She says, "yeah."

21:11.550 --> 21:13.518
Say good night
to Grandma, Emma.

21:13.519 --> 21:17.954
