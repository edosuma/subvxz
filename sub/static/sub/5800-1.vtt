ALICE IN THE CITIES

01:39.517 --> 01:44.230
A FILM BY WIM WENDERS

07:37.583 --> 07:41.420
It just never shows what you saw!

07:52.598 --> 07:54.225
Shoot it!

07:54.350 --> 07:56.853
Shoot down everything
you can't stand.

08:06.863 --> 08:08.823
Talking to yourself...

08:10.992 --> 08:13.661
Actually, it's more like
listening than talking.

08:41.856 --> 08:44.650
I've never heard that to the end!

16:29.823 --> 16:32.785
FLIGHT CONTROLLERS ON STRIKE

17:07.027 --> 17:08.696
I'm not finished yet.

17:10.698 --> 17:13.617
I took a lot
of pictures and notes.

17:14.326 --> 17:16.120
I've got enough material.

17:16.245 --> 17:20.124
You weren't supposed to take pictures.
You were supposed to write a story.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.168
Yes, I know.

17:24.545 --> 17:27.506
But the story
is about things you can see.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.883
About images and signs.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.678
You've been on the road
for four weeks now,

17:32.803 --> 17:35.806
and all you've got
is a bunch of pictures.

17:35.931 --> 17:37.891
You were supposed
to write something.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.310
I could have gotten pictures
somewhere else.

17:40.477 --> 17:44.106
You were supposed to write
about the American landscape.

17:44.231 --> 17:47.359
I've already gotten three telexes
from the publisher in Munich,

17:47.484 --> 17:50.487
and I look like an idiot.
So what do I do now?

17:50.738 --> 17:52.906
I'm not done yet. That's all.

17:56.785 --> 18:00.414
When you drive around America,
something happens to you.

18:00.748 --> 18:03.083
The images you see change you.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.253
And the reason
I took so many photos...

18:08.213 --> 18:10.215
is part of the story.

18:10.632 --> 18:12.718
I can't explain it now.

18:12.843 --> 18:14.845
Tell that to the publisher.

18:15.012 --> 18:19.183
You won't meet the deadline.
That's all I can say.

18:20.350 --> 18:23.729
I'll finish the story in Germany.
I fly to Munich today.

18:23.854 --> 18:26.607
Do you have money
for the ticket?

18:27.024 --> 18:29.401
Just enough for the ticket.

18:31.779 --> 18:34.698
But I meant to ask you
for an advance.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.325
My dear friend...

18:36.533 --> 18:38.619
you won't get
a penny from me.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.249
And take your picture
postcards with you.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.885
I'll tell the publisher
you're coming back to Munich

18:55.010 --> 18:57.721
and that I've got nothing
to do with this anymore.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.511
Because of the
flight controllers' strike.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.973
I read about it but didn't realize
there were no flights to Germany.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.766
But I must fly back today!

20:25.225 --> 20:27.644
She just suggested
a flight to Amsterdam.

20:27.978 --> 20:31.732
Of all places!
I was in Amsterdam long enough.

20:32.107 --> 20:34.026
That's the only way.

20:35.402 --> 20:38.822
Can you ask when the next flight
to Amsterdam is today?

20:46.747 --> 20:48.248
Tomorrow afternoon.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.966
We can't go till tomorrow,
and only to Amsterdam.

20:58.133 --> 21:00.677
<i>We haven't been there
in a long time.</i>

21:02.304 --> 21:04.097
Are you from Holland?

21:04.932 --> 21:06.767
We lived there.

21:07.392 --> 21:09.227
Could you book
the flight for me?

21:09.603 --> 21:11.563
My English is so bad.

21:30.791 --> 21:32.668
Your first name.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.628
Lisa and Alice.

21:50.644 --> 21:52.646
Would you wait with us?

21:52.813 --> 21:54.982
Otherwise
I don't know how I'll stand it.

21:58.235 --> 22:02.239
I can do that,
but I'm not very entertaining.

22:02.614 --> 22:04.908
You could be mute for all I care.

22:17.546 --> 22:19.464
What does he want from us?

22:19.923 --> 22:21.341
Why?

22:21.466 --> 22:24.678
What do you have against him?
He's quite nice.

22:25.095 --> 22:28.515
I don't have anything against him.
But what does he want?

22:28.640 --> 22:30.851
He just helped us at the flight desk.

22:30.976 --> 22:32.894
You could be a little nicer.

22:33.020 --> 22:36.148
If you spoke English,
everything would be different.

22:54.833 --> 22:56.376
That was quick.

23:02.466 --> 23:05.010
- Nobody home.
- Who wasn't home?

23:08.889 --> 23:11.391
- Have you decided?
- No hamburgers!

23:13.060 --> 23:16.146
- What do you want, then?
- A hot dog.

23:32.079 --> 23:34.581
I hope the hotel isn't too expensive.

23:34.706 --> 23:37.125
No, I used to stay there myself.

23:39.753 --> 23:42.255
Why are you
in such a hurry to leave?

23:42.714 --> 23:44.925
I want to get back to Germany.

23:47.385 --> 23:49.638
I just broke up with a man.

23:49.763 --> 23:51.932
But I can't speak about it now.

24:00.941 --> 24:04.903
- See you tomorrow at the airport.
- Don't you want to have breakfast with us?

24:05.278 --> 24:07.781
I'll call you tomorrow morning
here at the hotel.

24:07.906 --> 24:09.324
Sure?

24:29.344 --> 24:31.388
I called a few times.

24:35.142 --> 24:37.060
Aren't you well?

24:40.438 --> 24:41.690
No.

25:03.795 --> 25:05.922
I got completely lost.

25:06.173 --> 25:08.341
It was a horrible journey.

25:12.137 --> 25:15.932
Once you leave New York City,
nothing changes anymore.

25:16.057 --> 25:17.684
It all looks the same.

25:17.851 --> 25:19.644
You can't imagine anything anymore.

25:19.811 --> 25:22.772
Above all,
you can't imagine any change.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.067
I became estranged from myself.

25:26.193 --> 25:30.197
All I could imagine
was going on and on like this forever.

25:33.867 --> 25:38.205
Some nights, I was sure
I would go back the next morning.

25:40.749 --> 25:43.585
But then I'd keep on driving...

25:45.962 --> 25:49.174
listening to that vulgar radio,

25:49.299 --> 25:51.509
and every night in a motel

25:51.635 --> 25:54.387
that looked just like
all the others before.

25:55.222 --> 25:57.974
I'd watch that barbarous television.

25:58.892 --> 26:01.019
I didn't know what hit me.

26:02.604 --> 26:05.440
You haven't known that
for a long time now.

26:06.191 --> 26:10.403
You don't have to travel
across America for that.

26:12.072 --> 26:17.744
That happens when you lose
all sense of your own self.

26:18.411 --> 26:21.414
And you lost that long ago.

26:22.707 --> 26:25.001
That's why you always need proof,

26:25.126 --> 26:27.587
proof you still exist.

26:28.421 --> 26:31.258
Your stories and your experiences â€’

26:31.925 --> 26:34.886
you treat them like raw eggs.

26:35.220 --> 26:38.265
As if you were the only one
to experience things.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.768
And that's why
you keep taking pictures.

26:41.935 --> 26:44.312
They're something
you can hold on to,

26:44.479 --> 26:48.817
more evidence that it was you
who saw these things.

26:54.155 --> 26:56.283
And that's why you came here.

26:58.827 --> 27:00.954
To have someone listen to you,

27:01.746 --> 27:05.625
to you and your stories
that you're only telling to yourself.

27:06.459 --> 27:09.254
But that's not enough
in the long run, my dear.

27:09.379 --> 27:10.922
That's right.

27:11.589 --> 27:14.467
Taking pictures
is a way of proving things.

27:18.763 --> 27:22.058
Waiting for the image to develop,

27:22.350 --> 27:24.853
I was often filled
with a strange unease.

27:25.520 --> 27:29.399
I could hardly wait
to compare the picture with reality.

27:30.442 --> 27:33.528
But comparing them
wouldn't reassure me either.

27:33.653 --> 27:36.489
As the still images
were always overtaken by reality...

27:36.698 --> 27:39.242
You can't stay here!

27:39.784 --> 27:42.287
...I photographed
even more obsessively.

27:43.538 --> 27:48.501
- You're really beside yourself!
- That's why I only took Polaroids...

27:48.668 --> 27:51.129
I don't want you to stay here,
understand?

27:52.255 --> 27:53.757
What?

27:56.343 --> 27:58.470
Are you serious?

28:00.347 --> 28:02.182
Yes, my friend.

28:04.684 --> 28:06.353
I can't help you.

28:08.897 --> 28:11.441
Though I'd like to comfort you.

28:13.193 --> 28:15.195
I don't understand.

28:17.030 --> 28:19.532
I don't know how to live either.

28:19.866 --> 28:22.202
Nobody has shown me either.

28:30.752 --> 28:33.171
In this city...

28:33.713 --> 28:35.924
when you reach an intersection...

28:36.841 --> 28:39.052
it's like...

28:44.140 --> 28:48.728
entering a clearing in the woods.

29:59.424 --> 30:02.260
I have to get a room
here at the hotel too.

30:02.385 --> 30:04.304
<i>- Have a look!</i>
- My friend...

30:13.646 --> 30:16.483
I'll bet you
I can blow it out from here.

30:16.649 --> 30:17.901
Never!

30:18.067 --> 30:19.527
Watch.

30:31.498 --> 30:33.333
Show me your watch.

30:36.503 --> 30:38.171
You cheated!

30:38.296 --> 30:42.050
To make up for that,
you'll take me there tomorrow.

30:45.970 --> 30:47.639
Go to bed now.

31:18.419 --> 31:21.631
Why don't you stay here?
There's plenty of room.

31:34.435 --> 31:36.563
During the last two years,

31:36.896 --> 31:39.065
we've lived in four different cities.

31:39.774 --> 31:41.025
Where?

31:41.776 --> 31:43.403
Where?

31:43.903 --> 31:46.906
Now he's been working here
for three months...

31:48.074 --> 31:50.743
and wants to settle
in America for good.

31:51.828 --> 31:54.372
But I don't think
he believes I'm serious.

31:55.957 --> 31:59.252
He expects me to come back
tonight with my suitcase,

31:59.377 --> 32:03.089
cry all night,
and everything will be fine again.

32:03.923 --> 32:06.426
He isn't Alice's father?

32:08.845 --> 32:13.057
Alice told me a joke this afternoon.
Do you know it?

32:15.226 --> 32:19.731
How do four elephants fit
into a red Volkswagen?

32:24.736 --> 32:26.738
I can't sleep with you

32:28.156 --> 32:31.284
But I'd like to share
the bed with you.

33:32.470 --> 33:34.430
What are you writing?

33:43.356 --> 33:45.358
"What's so barbaric about this TV

33:45.525 --> 33:49.320
is not that it chops up everything
and interrupts it with ads,

33:49.445 --> 33:51.114
though that's bad enough.

33:51.239 --> 33:55.952
Far worse is that everything it shows
turns into advertising too,

33:56.077 --> 33:59.247
ads for the status quo.

33:59.372 --> 34:04.711
All these TV images come down
to the same common, ugly message,

34:04.877 --> 34:07.296
a kind of vicious contempt.

34:08.089 --> 34:12.093
No image leaves you in peace.
They all want something from you."

34:12.260 --> 34:15.388
When I told Hans
I wanted to break up...

34:16.139 --> 34:19.684
he said everything would be fine
once we had a place in New York.

34:19.809 --> 34:22.395
He should stay in Europe
if he doesn't want to lose you.

34:25.231 --> 34:27.734
He says he'd rather kill himself.

35:53.694 --> 35:58.282
"I'll meet you at the Empire
State Building at 1:00 p.m."

37:06.726 --> 37:09.103
Your jacket is much too large.

37:12.440 --> 37:15.902
What have you got in there?
Hot dogs?

37:38.674 --> 37:41.052
So that's how it is!

37:44.805 --> 37:48.017
No need to wait here any longer.

38:42.780 --> 38:45.658
Do you have
another dime for me?

38:45.908 --> 38:48.494
No, we need to go back
to the hotel now.

38:48.661 --> 38:50.830
Mommy isn't coming anymore?

38:56.961 --> 38:59.130
Hey, you mustn't do that!

39:18.482 --> 39:22.028
The lady left the hotel
one hour ago.

39:26.532 --> 39:30.703
"I can't leave yet. Hans is desperate.
I can't leave him alone now.

39:30.870 --> 39:34.373
Please take Alice with you
or I'll never get away from here.

39:34.498 --> 39:36.208
Wait for me in Amsterdam.

39:36.375 --> 39:38.544
I'll be there the day after tomorrow."

39:38.669 --> 39:40.463
Who wrote to you?

39:40.629 --> 39:43.007
- Your mother.
- What did she write?

39:43.716 --> 39:46.302
That she'll join us
in Amsterdam.

39:57.021 --> 40:01.025
I saw all that when we got here.

40:07.573 --> 40:10.826
Do you have all you need
in your suitcase?

40:21.962 --> 40:23.923
Do you like flying?

40:27.635 --> 40:31.347
I like the food.
It's nicely wrapped up.

41:47.715 --> 41:49.717
I was looking for you!

41:53.929 --> 41:56.932
Can't you bring me
something to eat?

42:44.396 --> 42:47.024
Let's go. That's our flight.

43:15.719 --> 43:18.847
Are you looking forward
to going home?

43:19.556 --> 43:21.225
I don't know.

43:22.977 --> 43:25.646
I'd just as well stay in New York.

43:25.771 --> 43:27.648
Why don't you then?

43:29.191 --> 43:31.110
I have no money left.

44:37.843 --> 44:40.095
There's nothing on it!

44:41.972 --> 44:45.851
You have to wait a few minutes.
It gets very sharp.

45:01.533 --> 45:04.203
What did you ask the stewardess?

45:04.620 --> 45:07.247
I asked for an aspirin.

45:07.373 --> 45:09.541
Mommy's afraid of flying too.

45:09.750 --> 45:12.044
She even gets headaches beforehand.

45:15.714 --> 45:19.468
Maybe I should've eaten something.

45:20.010 --> 45:21.595
You see!

45:24.139 --> 45:27.226
It's a nice picture. It's so empty.

45:40.781 --> 45:42.616
Is there...

45:44.576 --> 45:46.578
an L?

45:49.832 --> 45:53.544
Is there... a U?

45:54.753 --> 45:56.213
Yes.

45:58.757 --> 46:00.759
Only one?

46:01.844 --> 46:04.638
One U, yes. It's not a Zulu.

46:05.848 --> 46:07.891
Is there an H?

46:08.100 --> 46:09.435
No.

46:10.144 --> 46:12.521
Is there an F?
No, we had that already.

46:12.646 --> 46:14.022
We had that already.

46:14.189 --> 46:15.816
Is there an O?

46:15.983 --> 46:17.276
No.

46:17.860 --> 46:19.903
One more line...

46:20.571 --> 46:22.448
and you're hanged.

46:24.658 --> 46:26.994
- An I?
- No.

46:27.494 --> 46:29.413
What's the word?

46:32.958 --> 46:34.418
"Dream."

46:34.543 --> 46:37.421
"Dream."
Words like that don't count.

46:37.546 --> 46:39.631
Only things that really exist.

47:44.404 --> 47:47.074
Why is the time different here?

47:48.075 --> 47:50.369
Can't you see?
It's already light.

47:54.998 --> 47:56.792
At midnight?

47:57.042 --> 47:59.336
Believe me, it's 5:00 a.m.

47:59.503 --> 48:01.922
Will we go back to sleep?

48:05.300 --> 48:07.553
At the closest hotel to the airport.

48:08.679 --> 48:10.722
No matter how much it costs.

48:44.631 --> 48:46.925
I'm not tired anymore.

48:47.134 --> 48:49.261
There's no way I can go to sleep.

48:49.428 --> 48:51.847
When do you want to wake up?

48:53.056 --> 48:54.516
At 11:00.

50:02.668 --> 50:04.586
Yes, yes. Thanks.

50:29.486 --> 50:31.697
Can I use your toothbrush?

50:32.531 --> 50:34.449
If you don't mind.

50:37.786 --> 50:40.872
Will we go downtown
and buy one?

50:41.790 --> 50:44.251
Go downtown for a toothbrush?

50:44.835 --> 50:46.503
I don't believe it!

50:46.670 --> 50:49.047
Do you want to stay
at the hotel?

50:50.048 --> 50:51.383
Yes.

50:53.468 --> 50:55.721
I could show you around.

50:57.389 --> 50:59.683
I used to live here.

51:05.856 --> 51:08.233
I had a strange dream.

51:22.497 --> 51:24.833
I turned on the TV.

51:25.709 --> 51:29.171
I sat down in a chair
and tied myself to it,

51:30.213 --> 51:33.175
and then suddenly
a horror movie came on.

51:34.134 --> 51:36.720
And I couldn't get free.

51:38.972 --> 51:42.309
I couldn't turn off the TV either.

51:43.935 --> 51:46.938
I couldn't close my eyes.

51:48.315 --> 51:50.567
I couldn't untie myself.

51:50.734 --> 51:53.236
So I had to watch the movie.

52:17.302 --> 52:19.596
Tell me something about yourself.

52:20.972 --> 52:22.974
I don't know what to tell you.

52:23.099 --> 52:27.312
You really don't know a thing
you could tell me about yourself?

52:29.856 --> 52:31.858
How old are you?

52:34.361 --> 52:36.154
Thirty-one.

52:41.701 --> 52:44.287
I want to take your picture.

52:59.386 --> 53:02.681
So at least you'll know
what you look like.

53:36.381 --> 53:40.343
Will you take a picture of Mommy
when she arrives at the airport?

53:40.760 --> 53:42.637
We'll have to get up early.

53:42.762 --> 53:45.599
As soon as we're back in the canals,
we'll go onshore.

53:45.724 --> 53:48.226
But the tour isn't over.

53:48.560 --> 53:50.896
You haven't seen anything yet.

53:51.646 --> 53:54.357
I don't want to see anything.

54:05.243 --> 54:07.370
I want to go back to the hotel.

54:07.537 --> 54:09.164
I'm hungry!

54:11.124 --> 54:13.460
You're walking too fast!

54:20.467 --> 54:21.968
Amsterdam!

54:22.802 --> 54:26.765
Amsterdam is
much more beautiful than New York!

54:27.599 --> 54:29.309
Well...

54:29.601 --> 54:31.353
Food!

54:32.479 --> 54:34.814
That's all you think about.

54:35.148 --> 54:37.776
I want to eat!

54:41.404 --> 54:44.532
Do we have to eat
in such a cheap restaurant?

54:45.700 --> 54:48.119
I don't have much money left.

54:48.495 --> 54:52.499
Then why are we staying
at such an expensive hotel?

54:53.500 --> 54:56.044
Because it's next to the airport.

55:05.804 --> 55:07.722
It's all in Dutch.

55:07.847 --> 55:09.724
I can't read it.

55:27.200 --> 55:29.327
That doesn't help!

55:29.661 --> 55:31.371
You wanted me to read.

55:31.538 --> 55:33.915
I don't want to eat here!

55:35.458 --> 55:38.169
We came here because of you,
remember?

55:38.336 --> 55:41.214
I do want to eat,
but not just anything.

55:41.423 --> 55:44.134
- What do you want to eat?
- A real meal.

55:45.635 --> 55:48.805
Listen, I won't let you
tyrannize me any longer.

55:48.972 --> 55:50.974
Because of you,
I'm wandering around this town!

55:51.099 --> 55:53.143
It's not my fault!

55:55.562 --> 55:57.522
You are so stupid!

55:59.816 --> 56:01.818
Baby face!

56:04.112 --> 56:06.865
You'll be glad to get rid of me,
won't you?

56:07.574 --> 56:09.701
Don't be bitchy.

56:15.957 --> 56:17.834
I'll read you a story.

56:18.501 --> 56:20.378
I can read on my own.

56:30.263 --> 56:33.224
Do you leave a light on
when you go to sleep?

56:33.391 --> 56:37.187
What do you mean?
Want me to leave a light on?

56:37.562 --> 56:40.356
Yes.
I can't sleep without a light.

56:42.067 --> 56:45.904
I'll turn on the bathroom light

56:46.029 --> 56:48.114
and leave the door ajar.

57:21.439 --> 57:23.108
What is it?

57:25.777 --> 57:27.278
Fear.

57:28.113 --> 57:30.240
What kind of fear?

57:34.661 --> 57:36.913
Are there different kinds?

57:37.288 --> 57:38.540
Yes.

57:45.088 --> 57:49.217
I'm afraid of fear.

57:50.677 --> 57:54.722
Why are you afraid of fear?

57:56.141 --> 57:59.144
Yes. Why?

57:59.561 --> 58:01.312
Aren't you cold?

58:10.697 --> 58:13.616
Can't you dry yourself
in the bedroom?

58:13.908 --> 58:15.743
I've got to go to the toilet.

58:16.327 --> 58:18.163
What are the matches for?

58:19.414 --> 58:21.583
So it doesn't stink.

58:59.746 --> 59:02.874
All the passengers from New York
came through long ago.

59:03.041 --> 59:06.377
I asked. Your mother wasn't
on the list of passengers.

59:06.544 --> 59:08.755
We'll go to the information desk.

59:09.214 --> 59:10.882
Then we'll see.

59:49.212 --> 59:51.256
Is that your daughter back there?

59:52.257 --> 59:56.761
She's been crying the whole time.
Maybe you should look after her.

59:57.095 --> 59:59.305
You may come in.

1:00:11.276 --> 1:00:12.902
Open up.

1:00:22.912 --> 1:00:25.373
Alice, please come out.

1:00:25.498 --> 1:00:27.750
Why didn't she come?

1:00:29.794 --> 1:00:31.963
I'm sure she'll be
on the next flight.

1:00:32.130 --> 1:00:35.425
We'll go to the information desk
and sort it all out.

1:00:35.758 --> 1:00:38.177
What do you want to sort out?

1:00:39.345 --> 1:00:41.264
They'll take care of you.

1:00:41.389 --> 1:00:43.975
You just want to get rid of me.

1:00:44.142 --> 1:00:48.354
Alice, I can't wait here at the airport
forever for your mother!

1:00:48.521 --> 1:00:50.481
But I'm supposed to?

1:00:50.690 --> 1:00:52.942
Where do you want to go then?

1:00:53.860 --> 1:00:55.653
I don't know.

1:01:02.577 --> 1:01:06.331
Didn't you say you wanted
to visit your grandmother?

1:01:06.497 --> 1:01:07.749
Yes.

1:01:07.915 --> 1:01:10.585
- Where does she live?
- I don't know.

1:01:12.295 --> 1:01:16.090
- But you can surely remember.
- I can.

1:01:16.883 --> 1:01:18.343
See.

1:01:21.971 --> 1:01:23.431
So?

1:01:24.891 --> 1:01:26.934
I can't think of it right now.

1:01:27.101 --> 1:01:29.437
Don't you even remember
the town?

1:01:29.604 --> 1:01:33.191
I don't know the name anymore.

1:01:40.198 --> 1:01:43.034
Maybe she lives in...

1:01:43.159 --> 1:01:45.244
Frankfurt?
- No.

1:01:47.121 --> 1:01:48.790
Gelsenkirchen?

1:01:48.956 --> 1:01:50.249
GÃ¶ttingen?

1:01:50.416 --> 1:01:51.918
Hamburg?

1:01:52.377 --> 1:01:53.753
Hanover?

1:01:53.920 --> 1:01:55.463
Heidelberg?

1:01:57.590 --> 1:01:58.966
Kassel?

1:01:59.133 --> 1:02:01.052
Koblenz?

1:02:01.219 --> 1:02:02.762
Cologne?

1:02:02.929 --> 1:02:05.807
Ludwigshafen?
LÃ¼beck? Mainz?

1:02:05.973 --> 1:02:07.392
Mannheim?

1:02:07.558 --> 1:02:09.310
MÃ¶nchengladbach?

1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:11.396
Munich?

1:02:14.232 --> 1:02:15.149
Nuremberg?

1:02:15.274 --> 1:02:16.275
Oberhausen?

1:02:16.442 --> 1:02:17.819
Offenbach?

1:02:17.985 --> 1:02:19.779
Recklinghausen?

1:02:19.946 --> 1:02:21.489
SaarbrÃ¼cken?

1:02:22.657 --> 1:02:26.035
Trier? I wouldn't want
to live in Trier either.

1:02:26.202 --> 1:02:27.829
Ulm?

1:02:30.248 --> 1:02:32.291
Now I've reached W.

1:02:33.459 --> 1:02:35.086
Wiesbaden?

1:02:35.711 --> 1:02:36.963
No.

1:02:37.296 --> 1:02:38.881
Worms?

1:02:39.340 --> 1:02:40.675
No.

1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:42.635
WÃ¼rzburg?

1:02:42.844 --> 1:02:44.011
No.

1:02:44.137 --> 1:02:46.764
Wuppertal?
- Wuppertal?

1:02:57.233 --> 1:03:00.695
And where in Wuppertal?

1:03:12.165 --> 1:03:14.292
I know exactly where.

1:03:14.459 --> 1:03:17.128
I'll find it when we're there.

1:03:23.134 --> 1:03:25.470
<i>How do you want your hair?</i>

1:03:25.636 --> 1:03:27.180
Alice?

1:03:28.639 --> 1:03:31.893
Can you tell the hairdresser
not to cut away too much?

1:03:32.018 --> 1:03:34.395
Only to layer the ends.

1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:37.523
<i>Don't make it too short.
He wants</i> â€’

1:03:40.776 --> 1:03:43.029
What does "layer" mean?

1:03:51.204 --> 1:03:53.873
<i>I don't understand.
Does he want me to thin it out?</i>

1:03:54.040 --> 1:03:55.458
<i>I think it's thin enough.</i>

1:03:55.583 --> 1:03:57.585
<i>Should I wash his hair
and give him a scalp massage?</i>

1:03:57.710 --> 1:04:01.422
<i>- Sounds like a good idea.</i>
- What did he say?

1:04:02.673 --> 1:04:04.175
Nothing.

1:04:07.678 --> 1:04:09.764
When does our bus leave?

1:04:13.017 --> 1:04:14.644
At 4:00.

1:05:22.920 --> 1:05:26.757
Alice, please. You must know
your grandmother's name!

1:05:27.425 --> 1:05:29.093
Not Van Dam?

1:05:29.260 --> 1:05:31.846
That's my name!

1:05:32.054 --> 1:05:34.432
Grandma has another name.

1:05:35.141 --> 1:05:38.894
Your mother.
What was her maiden name?

1:05:39.020 --> 1:05:41.480
What was her name
before she got married?

1:05:41.981 --> 1:05:44.191
I don't know!

1:05:48.613 --> 1:05:51.824
But I do know
where Grandma lives!

1:05:53.868 --> 1:05:57.038
I'll show you
when we pass by.

1:06:05.004 --> 1:06:07.423
Come on, Alice.
It's getting dark.

1:06:08.674 --> 1:06:11.135
We have to find a hotel.

1:06:13.679 --> 1:06:15.640
We'll continue tomorrow.

1:07:14.198 --> 1:07:16.367
Stop crying!

1:07:21.622 --> 1:07:25.084
Alice, don't get discouraged.

1:07:25.376 --> 1:07:27.878
We haven't really
started looking for her.

1:07:28.879 --> 1:07:31.215
Tomorrow we'll go to city hall.

1:07:31.382 --> 1:07:34.051
But I don't know the name!

1:07:45.271 --> 1:07:47.356
Will you tell me a story?

1:07:47.481 --> 1:07:49.900
I don't know any stories!

1:08:00.077 --> 1:08:04.081
Once upon a time
there was a man.

1:08:07.668 --> 1:08:12.173
Where'd you get that radio?
- I traded with the girl on the bus.

1:08:15.384 --> 1:08:17.970
Once there was a little boy

1:08:18.763 --> 1:08:20.765
who had gotten lost.

1:08:21.932 --> 1:08:26.020
He'd gone for a walk
in the woods with his mother

1:08:26.604 --> 1:08:29.190
on a beautiful summer afternoon.

1:08:31.442 --> 1:08:34.528
When they came to a clearing...

1:08:40.826 --> 1:08:42.953
where the sun was shining...

1:08:43.954 --> 1:08:47.583
his mother suddenly felt tired

1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.127
and wanted to rest.

1:08:51.629 --> 1:08:55.800
All of a sudden the boy heard
a rustling in the bushes,

1:08:56.300 --> 1:08:58.636
and he discovered a hedgehog.

1:08:59.678 --> 1:09:03.474
He followed the hedgehog
until he came to a stream.

1:09:03.641 --> 1:09:06.644
And in the stream he saw a fish.

1:09:07.353 --> 1:09:09.647
He walked along the stream
for a long time

1:09:09.772 --> 1:09:11.524
until he reached a bridge.

1:09:11.649 --> 1:09:13.484
On the bridge

1:09:13.818 --> 1:09:15.694
he saw a horseman.

1:09:26.413 --> 1:09:27.915
And then?

1:09:29.458 --> 1:09:31.335
The horseman...

1:09:32.211 --> 1:09:34.922
sat very quietly on his horse

1:09:35.172 --> 1:09:37.508
and looked into the distance.

1:09:38.801 --> 1:09:41.136
The boy went up to the bridge

1:09:41.262 --> 1:09:45.349
and walked cautiously
around the horse.

1:09:46.934 --> 1:09:50.479
Then the horseman
rode slowly away.

1:09:50.646 --> 1:09:55.526
The boy followed him
until he lost sight of him.

1:09:56.402 --> 1:09:59.029
And he reached a big road.

1:09:59.655 --> 1:10:02.533
On the road
there were many trucks.

1:10:03.534 --> 1:10:06.370
The boy waited on the roadside

1:10:06.537 --> 1:10:08.622
until a truck stopped.

1:10:08.747 --> 1:10:12.543
The driver asked him
if he needed a ride.

1:10:13.127 --> 1:10:15.296
The boy was delighted.

1:10:15.588 --> 1:10:18.549
He was proud
to sit next to the driver,

1:10:18.883 --> 1:10:22.553
who let him turn the dial
on the radio.

1:10:24.555 --> 1:10:28.017
And the boy drove with him
until they reached the sea.

1:10:29.727 --> 1:10:33.689
And at the sea
he remembered his mother.

1:11:09.475 --> 1:11:13.437
I don't like my cornflakes like this.
They're already soggy.

1:11:13.771 --> 1:11:16.523
I want to pour on
the milk myself.

1:11:16.690 --> 1:11:19.652
Bring her another bowl.
And tea for me.

1:11:22.655 --> 1:11:24.615
I've rented a car.

1:11:24.782 --> 1:11:27.034
We'll drive down all the streets.

1:11:27.159 --> 1:11:29.203
Then we'll surely find the house.

1:11:29.411 --> 1:11:32.331
When I see it, I'll recognize it.

1:11:34.583 --> 1:11:37.419
What kind of car?
- A Renault.

1:11:37.544 --> 1:11:39.505
- A big one?
- No.

1:11:41.632 --> 1:11:44.134
I thought you had no money left.

1:11:44.259 --> 1:11:47.346
I found a few Eurochecks
from last year.

1:11:47.513 --> 1:11:49.765
At the car rental
they didn't notice.

1:11:49.890 --> 1:11:51.809
Where does that come from?

1:11:51.976 --> 1:11:53.644
What?

1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:08.659
I forgot to give it back.

1:12:15.416 --> 1:12:18.002
What does the house look like?

1:12:22.172 --> 1:12:23.882
It was old.

1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:31.557
There were trees.

1:12:38.772 --> 1:12:40.983
That's all you remember?

1:12:41.692 --> 1:12:43.861
The staircase was dark.

1:13:00.210 --> 1:13:02.087
It's vibrating.

1:13:48.300 --> 1:13:51.053
What's green
and jumps from tree to tree?

1:13:51.178 --> 1:13:53.097
You better pay attention.

1:13:53.931 --> 1:13:55.933
You'll never guess.

1:13:56.642 --> 1:13:58.769
Look for your house.

1:14:03.649 --> 1:14:05.526
School is out.

1:15:00.831 --> 1:15:03.584
That's the street where our hotel is!

1:15:03.750 --> 1:15:05.002
So?

1:15:05.169 --> 1:15:06.795
I'm thirsty.

1:16:08.232 --> 1:16:10.984
<i>- What can I get you?</i>
- A coffee.

1:16:11.109 --> 1:16:13.070
I want something too.

1:16:13.487 --> 1:16:15.113
Then order something.

1:16:15.280 --> 1:16:17.074
A big sundae.

1:16:17.241 --> 1:16:18.867
<i>- Whipped cream?</i>
- Yes.

1:16:18.992 --> 1:16:21.620
<i>- Mixed flavors?</i>
- Yes.

1:16:23.914 --> 1:16:27.417
- I thought you were thirsty.
- But I want ice cream.

1:16:53.277 --> 1:16:56.029
Grandma doesn't live
in Wuppertal.

1:17:17.301 --> 1:17:19.553
Here you are.

1:18:27.537 --> 1:18:29.456
My, oh my...

1:18:51.645 --> 1:18:54.064
Why didn't you say so before?

1:18:59.653 --> 1:19:01.363
Do you think â€’

1:19:02.572 --> 1:19:05.951
Do you think I'm keen
on driving around with little girls

1:19:06.076 --> 1:19:08.078
and spending my last dime?

1:19:12.541 --> 1:19:14.584
God knows
I've got other things to do.

1:19:15.252 --> 1:19:17.838
I wanted to stay in Amsterdam.

1:19:20.257 --> 1:19:22.926
What do you have to do anyway?

1:19:23.427 --> 1:19:26.096
You're only scribbling away
in your notebook.

1:19:42.612 --> 1:19:45.198
I'm taking you to the police now.

1:19:47.033 --> 1:19:49.453
They can help you better than I.

1:20:44.049 --> 1:20:46.009
<i>Please sign here.</i>

1:20:49.471 --> 1:20:52.766
<i>Can we reach you at the hotel,
at least until tomorrow,</i>

1:20:52.974 --> 1:20:55.352
<i>in case we have any questions?
- Yes.</i>

1:20:56.603 --> 1:20:58.522
<i>If you leave...</i>

1:20:58.688 --> 1:21:03.026
<i>please inform us
and give us your new address.</i>

1:21:04.778 --> 1:21:08.907
Oh, my pen. Can you give it back?
You accidentally put it away.

1:21:09.032 --> 1:21:10.700
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

1:21:18.375 --> 1:21:20.001
Take care.

1:21:21.836 --> 1:21:24.089
I'm sure
they'll find your grandma.

1:21:25.590 --> 1:21:27.384
Or your mother.

1:24:20.223 --> 1:24:22.392
Now I know where my grandma lives.

1:24:22.892 --> 1:24:24.561
Do you?

1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:37.574
Well, then we'd better get going.

1:24:37.741 --> 1:24:39.117
- Yes.
- No!

1:24:39.242 --> 1:24:41.828
Earlier on,
one of the policemen was here.

1:24:42.412 --> 1:24:45.331
But I stayed
on the other side of street.

1:24:46.374 --> 1:24:49.753
You can't imagine what
they gave me to eat at the station.

1:25:13.401 --> 1:25:16.780
When the policemen
questioned me,

1:25:16.905 --> 1:25:19.616
I remembered
that Mommy and I

1:25:19.783 --> 1:25:23.787
used to live here in Wuppertal.

1:25:24.412 --> 1:25:26.039
When I was little.

1:25:26.247 --> 1:25:27.874
Not my grandma.

1:25:28.625 --> 1:25:31.169
The policemen looked it up...

1:25:32.003 --> 1:25:33.755
and I was right.

1:25:33.880 --> 1:25:37.675
And Mommy wasn't called
Van Dam, but KrÃ¼ger.

1:25:38.051 --> 1:25:40.136
And then I remembered,

1:25:40.261 --> 1:25:42.931
and I told the police

1:25:43.765 --> 1:25:46.893
that we used to travel
to Grandma's by train.

1:25:47.060 --> 1:25:50.230
And it couldn't be
very far from here,

1:25:50.814 --> 1:25:55.276
because we were always
back in the evening.

1:25:58.822 --> 1:26:01.908
And when Grandma
read a story to me,

1:26:02.075 --> 1:26:06.162
the pages always rustled
when she turned them,

1:26:06.287 --> 1:26:10.625
because little pieces of coal
came in through the window.

1:26:11.209 --> 1:26:16.464
Then the policemen said that
that makes it easy.

1:26:16.631 --> 1:26:18.842
Grandma lives in the Ruhr region.

1:26:19.509 --> 1:26:21.511
In the Ruhr region.

1:26:22.345 --> 1:26:24.138
Is that big?

1:26:24.681 --> 1:26:27.851
Not particularly.
We'll manage.

1:26:28.852 --> 1:26:31.396
I went to a rock-and-roll concert.

1:26:32.188 --> 1:26:33.398
What?

1:26:33.523 --> 1:26:36.192
Chuck Berry was singing.
Do you know him?

1:26:36.359 --> 1:26:37.986
I think so.

1:26:46.452 --> 1:26:48.621
Do you like rock and roll?

1:26:48.997 --> 1:26:50.290
Yes.

1:27:33.082 --> 1:27:35.585
- Have a good sleep?
- Yes.

1:27:35.752 --> 1:27:37.587
You're scribbling again?

1:27:42.008 --> 1:27:44.135
Here's your breakfast.

1:27:54.437 --> 1:27:57.357
And that is the Ruhr region.

1:27:58.399 --> 1:28:00.693
There are lots of people
called KrÃ¼ger.

1:28:00.818 --> 1:28:03.613
We need to know
your grandma's first name.

1:28:06.491 --> 1:28:08.076
Grandma!

1:28:11.371 --> 1:28:13.915
Didn't I show you the picture?

1:28:14.290 --> 1:28:16.167
What picture?

1:28:18.920 --> 1:28:23.549
I didn't show it to the policemen.
And then I forgot.

1:28:27.553 --> 1:28:30.264
Well, that makes it easy.

1:28:30.390 --> 1:28:32.141
Of course.

1:28:51.369 --> 1:28:54.163
- Do you know the Ruhr region?
- Yes.

1:28:55.373 --> 1:28:57.250
I lived here as a boy.

1:28:57.458 --> 1:28:59.460
I went to school here.

1:29:00.420 --> 1:29:04.507
But I haven't been back
in nine or ten years.

1:29:04.674 --> 1:29:07.677
You haven't seen your parents
in that long?

1:29:08.094 --> 1:29:09.679
Yes, I have.

1:29:09.887 --> 1:29:12.181
I see them now and then.

1:29:12.890 --> 1:29:15.643
But they don't live in Duisburg now.
- Where then?

1:29:16.019 --> 1:29:19.897
On the other side of the Rhine,
on the Lower Rhine.

1:29:21.107 --> 1:29:23.693
Where will we go first?

1:29:24.277 --> 1:29:26.237
To Essen.

1:29:26.362 --> 1:29:28.781
"Essen" means "to eat."
That sounds good.

1:29:29.282 --> 1:29:31.284
Does it ring a bell?

1:29:31.534 --> 1:29:32.702
No.

1:29:33.244 --> 1:29:37.540
We'll just ask everyone
if they know this house.

1:30:02.523 --> 1:30:05.359
Excuse me.
Do you recognize this house?

1:30:05.485 --> 1:30:07.403
Could it be nearby?

1:30:08.071 --> 1:30:11.407
Well, I haven't seen it
around here.

1:30:12.784 --> 1:30:15.078
I don't know.
It's not around here.

1:30:15.244 --> 1:30:20.083
These old buildings
are all being torn down.

1:30:20.249 --> 1:30:24.462
Krupp wants to build
a new hospital there, and â€’

1:30:24.629 --> 1:30:26.172
Thanks.

1:31:17.181 --> 1:31:22.728
I think it's a pity that the beautiful
old houses are being torn down.

1:31:23.521 --> 1:31:25.815
They don't bring in enough rent.

1:31:29.527 --> 1:31:33.281
The empty spaces look like graves.

1:31:33.406 --> 1:31:35.491
Like house graves.

1:31:52.383 --> 1:31:55.553
Have any of you
ever seen this house?

1:31:56.762 --> 1:31:58.764
NO SOLICITING
NO MOTOR VEHICLES

1:31:58.890 --> 1:32:00.850
NO SOCCER OR BALL GAMES

1:32:27.210 --> 1:32:30.004
Let's ask the taxi driver over there.

1:32:30.129 --> 1:32:32.381
He'll know the place.

1:32:41.724 --> 1:32:44.227
Do you know where this could be?

1:32:46.562 --> 1:32:50.233
Not here in Duisburg, in any case.
I don't recognize it.

1:32:50.358 --> 1:32:52.318
Maybe Oberhausen.

1:32:56.572 --> 1:32:57.907
Hold on!

1:32:58.074 --> 1:33:01.327
It could be in Gelsenkirchen,
around Schalke or so.

1:33:01.494 --> 1:33:05.081
- Thanks.
- ErdbrÃ¼cken Street.

1:33:05.665 --> 1:33:07.375
ErdbrÃ¼cken Street.

1:33:08.417 --> 1:33:10.711
Next time,
it will probably be in Hamburg.

1:33:10.836 --> 1:33:13.005
So where do we go first?

1:33:13.130 --> 1:33:15.424
Oberhausen or Gelsenkirchen?

1:33:16.050 --> 1:33:17.927
Oberhausen.

1:34:00.970 --> 1:34:04.140
Where Grandma lived,
it looked quite similar.

1:34:04.265 --> 1:34:06.892
Except that the houses
had two floors.

1:34:07.935 --> 1:34:10.271
Do you have a girlfriend?

1:34:12.940 --> 1:34:15.109
You know what?
I feel like going swimming.

1:34:15.318 --> 1:34:17.153
What about you?

1:34:17.820 --> 1:34:20.531
The water's probably dirty too.

1:35:10.164 --> 1:35:12.458
You want to stay back there?

1:35:12.583 --> 1:35:14.877
Yes. It's more comfortable.

1:35:20.049 --> 1:35:23.260
What city is this?
- Gelsenkirchen.

1:35:23.386 --> 1:35:26.722
ErdbrÃ¼cken Street.

1:35:27.848 --> 1:35:29.642
This must be it.

1:35:35.856 --> 1:35:37.441
These are nice pictures.

1:35:37.608 --> 1:35:40.444
At the police station
I wasn't allowed to smile.

1:35:40.611 --> 1:35:42.196
They took pictures?

1:35:42.738 --> 1:35:44.365
Of course.

1:35:53.249 --> 1:35:55.418
- Stop! There it is!
- What?

1:36:13.269 --> 1:36:15.604
This can't be.

1:36:47.636 --> 1:36:50.014
An Italian lady lives there.

1:36:50.639 --> 1:36:53.684
She says she's lived there
for two years.

1:36:55.144 --> 1:36:58.147
She doesn't know anything
about Grandma.

1:37:03.777 --> 1:37:06.071
Then we can go swimming now.

1:37:18.501 --> 1:37:20.127
You idiot!

1:37:21.837 --> 1:37:23.881
You silly old blockhead!

1:37:24.673 --> 1:37:26.342
Polliwog!

1:37:27.510 --> 1:37:29.136
Bed wetter!

1:37:30.429 --> 1:37:32.681
- You turd!
- Stupid cow!

1:37:34.725 --> 1:37:36.060
Fatso!

1:37:36.185 --> 1:37:37.895
Nanny goat!

1:37:38.020 --> 1:37:39.480
Soup bone!

1:37:39.605 --> 1:37:42.441
- Boiling chicken!
- Pain in the neck!

1:37:43.442 --> 1:37:46.529
I wonder if people think
you're my father.

1:37:46.904 --> 1:37:48.113
Me?

1:37:48.781 --> 1:37:50.199
Why?

1:37:52.910 --> 1:37:54.620
I don't know.

1:37:57.373 --> 1:37:59.917
What else would they think?

1:38:01.460 --> 1:38:03.712
I'll ask that woman over there.

1:38:04.630 --> 1:38:06.465
No, no, come.

1:38:13.597 --> 1:38:16.350
Do you think that's my father?

1:38:17.017 --> 1:38:19.019
No, never.

1:38:19.311 --> 1:38:21.230
I'd bet you anything.

1:38:21.814 --> 1:38:23.899
See? She doesn't believe it.

1:38:24.108 --> 1:38:25.401
Why not?

1:38:27.111 --> 1:38:28.904
Why not?

1:38:29.363 --> 1:38:33.576
- He's too fat.
- And he's always touching his nose.

1:38:37.413 --> 1:38:39.540
And he snores.

1:38:39.748 --> 1:38:42.459
He probably has flat feet.

1:38:42.585 --> 1:38:45.546
And he doesn't have any money.

1:38:45.671 --> 1:38:48.257
Not even enough
for a proper meal.

1:38:48.424 --> 1:38:50.426
You lying so-and-so!

1:38:51.260 --> 1:38:54.179
You won't eat anything
but hot dogs anyway.

1:38:54.471 --> 1:38:56.140
Are you hungry?

1:39:10.779 --> 1:39:12.990
That's all we needed.

1:39:17.953 --> 1:39:19.955
Someone who invites us to dinner.

1:39:55.449 --> 1:39:57.326
You little piggy!

1:39:57.493 --> 1:40:00.788
You really are acting
like her father.

1:40:00.996 --> 1:40:04.041
That's true.
She's brought me to this.

1:40:04.208 --> 1:40:06.669
But you seem to like it.

1:40:52.256 --> 1:40:55.175
I'm afraid the second bed
is a bit lower.

1:41:03.058 --> 1:41:04.893
How annoying.

1:42:25.891 --> 1:42:28.185
Will you get up?

1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:37.820
So early?

1:42:37.986 --> 1:42:40.072
Yes, please.

1:42:41.490 --> 1:42:43.033
Why?

1:43:23.198 --> 1:43:25.325
It's 6:00 a.m.!
Are you insane?

1:43:27.703 --> 1:43:29.955
Did you sleep well?

1:43:40.507 --> 1:43:44.469
Wouldn't you rather
have slept alone too?

1:43:45.554 --> 1:43:47.973
The couch was already taken.

1:43:48.307 --> 1:43:50.309
You got there first.

1:43:51.894 --> 1:43:54.187
What did you dream?

1:43:54.313 --> 1:43:56.356
I'll tell you later.

1:44:03.655 --> 1:44:05.782
Where do we go now?

1:44:07.743 --> 1:44:11.038
I don't even have enough money
to fill up the tank.

1:44:11.914 --> 1:44:14.708
We'll go to my parents' place.

1:44:25.010 --> 1:44:29.348
I'm thirsty.
Will you stop at the next kiosk?

1:44:29.723 --> 1:44:31.224
Yes.

1:45:01.922 --> 1:45:05.759
"Nine-year-old sought by police.
To help find her parents last night...

1:45:05.926 --> 1:45:09.972
a young man brought Alice Van Dam
to a police station in Wuppertal.

1:45:10.138 --> 1:45:13.809
One moment unobserved,
the child managed to run away.

1:45:13.934 --> 1:45:17.771
The blonde girl is wearing
a blue jacket that says 'Alaska.'''

1:45:17.896 --> 1:45:21.400
How far is it to your parents'?

1:45:21.566 --> 1:45:24.319
Just across the Rhine.
We'll take the ferry.

1:45:37.624 --> 1:45:40.794
You haven't taken
any pictures in a long time.

1:45:41.670 --> 1:45:43.547
Since Amsterdam.

1:45:45.424 --> 1:45:48.343
Are you looking forward
to seeing your parents?

1:46:46.485 --> 1:46:48.070
May I?

1:46:49.154 --> 1:46:51.490
There's nothing on it yet.

1:46:52.657 --> 1:46:54.451
It's coming.

1:46:55.035 --> 1:46:57.245
You must explain this to me.

1:46:57.454 --> 1:46:59.122
What?

1:46:59.247 --> 1:47:03.126
Why didn't you get in touch
with the police station?

1:47:03.710 --> 1:47:08.298
After all, you brought
the child there yourself.

1:47:09.299 --> 1:47:10.759
What?

1:47:10.926 --> 1:47:13.595
You didn't get
back in touch with us.

1:47:14.471 --> 1:47:18.850
The police found out yesterday
where the girl's grandmother lives,

1:47:19.434 --> 1:47:22.354
and her mother has shown up too.

1:47:23.772 --> 1:47:28.443
Only you and the child were missing.
You were simply gone.

1:47:29.486 --> 1:47:33.240
- How do you know that?
- I just talked to headquarters.

1:47:33.782 --> 1:47:35.575
They told me

1:47:35.700 --> 1:47:39.287
to take the girl
to the nearest station, in Duisburg,

1:47:39.496 --> 1:47:41.998
and put her on a train to Munich.

1:47:42.124 --> 1:47:43.959
- Really?
- Yes.

1:47:47.045 --> 1:47:49.131
Follow me in your car to Duisburg.

1:47:49.297 --> 1:47:51.258
I'll take the girl in my car.

1:48:15.407 --> 1:48:20.996
<i>Munich is preparing
for that honorable task.</i>

1:48:21.246 --> 1:48:23.331
<i>How old are you?</i>

1:48:23.498 --> 1:48:25.000
Nine.

1:48:27.127 --> 1:48:28.461
Nine.

1:48:34.301 --> 1:48:36.511
Do you have your ticket?

1:48:39.598 --> 1:48:42.350
Did you already return the car?

1:48:44.186 --> 1:48:46.646
Did you get any money back?

1:48:48.481 --> 1:48:50.859
The check just covered it.

1:49:08.668 --> 1:49:10.795
For your ticket.

1:49:23.850 --> 1:49:28.313
"LOST WORLD"
ON THE DEATH OF JOHN FORD

1:49:34.861 --> 1:49:37.239
What will you do in Munich?

1:49:41.785 --> 1:49:45.580
I'll finish writing that story.

1:49:47.999 --> 1:49:49.834
Your scribbling?

1:49:56.925 --> 1:49:59.594
And you?
What will you do?
