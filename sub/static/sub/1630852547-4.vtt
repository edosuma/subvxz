WEBVTT

00:05.731 --> 00:06.913
Oh, my goodness!

00:06.915 --> 00:09.842
You've put googly eyes
on everything!

00:10.069 --> 00:11.159
Except in the bathroom.

00:11.253 --> 00:12.569
No one needs
that kind of pressure.

00:12.588 --> 00:13.570
(laughs)

00:13.589 --> 00:15.255
I have so many new friends
to meet.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.257
And allow me to be
the first person

00:17.409 --> 00:19.743
to officially wish you
a happy 40th birthday.

00:19.762 --> 00:20.853
(laughs):
Oh...

00:21.004 --> 00:23.188
Officially! Yeah, yeah.

00:23.415 --> 00:26.416
Wouldn't want any, uh,
unauthorized "happy birthdays."

00:26.585 --> 00:29.419
No, wouldn't want the birthday
police knocking down the door

00:29.513 --> 00:31.697
and shoving a bunch of cake
in your face.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.366
-What are you looking for?
-Nothing.

00:34.518 --> 00:36.851
-Are you looking
for a birthday surprise?
-No.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.095
'Cause you said no surprises.

00:38.113 --> 00:39.429
You're right, I did.

00:39.523 --> 00:40.522
Why would I say that?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.599
More importantly,
why would he listen?

00:42.601 --> 00:45.786
Okay, off to work.
Have a great day, birthday girl.

00:45.938 --> 00:47.362
Yeah, you, too.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.006
See you tonight.

00:50.551 --> 00:54.511
Okay, if y'all know anything,
now's the time to tell me.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.209
(quiet chatter)

01:01.228 --> 01:02.394
Mm.

01:02.546 --> 01:03.896
("Get the Party Started"

Kentucky Kingdom was really fun,
but I am exhausted.

02:00.437 --> 02:02.770
My feet are screaming,
and, let's face it,

02:02.790 --> 02:05.532
twirly rides are
a young girl's game.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.276
It might have been the funnel
cake you ate before the ride

02:08.370 --> 02:10.796
and the funnel cake you ate
during the ride.

02:11.023 --> 02:12.280
Hey, I only ate half of that.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.282
The rest of it flew
out of my hand.

02:14.301 --> 02:17.261
(laughs): Yeah. That kid
behind us was pissed.

02:17.954 --> 02:19.396
Oh...

02:19.398 --> 02:21.974
Sometimes sitting down
is better than sex.

02:22.201 --> 02:24.201
It's been a long day.

02:24.219 --> 02:26.395
Not gonna take that personally.

02:28.298 --> 02:29.797
(groans)
But you're right.

02:29.875 --> 02:32.726
This couch might be the best
ride I've been on all day.

02:32.878 --> 02:34.135
(chuckles)

02:34.155 --> 02:36.238
(phone blips)

02:37.140 --> 02:38.306
My mom's back from Australia,

02:38.325 --> 02:40.534
and she wants to have dinner
with us.

02:41.403 --> 02:42.886
Meet your mom?

02:42.905 --> 02:44.388
Isn't it a little soon for that?

02:44.406 --> 02:46.147
I met yours
a week after we started dating.

02:46.241 --> 02:49.150
That's only because
I held her off for six days.

02:49.244 --> 02:50.502
Come on, she's gonna love you.

02:50.729 --> 02:52.729
I don't know.
I've got a rough track record

02:52.822 --> 02:54.748
when it comes
to meeting people's parents.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.258
It can't be that bad.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.510
Mom? Dad?

02:58.662 --> 03:00.012
This is Kat.

03:00.163 --> 03:02.306
(chuckles):
Hello. I brought you a gift.

03:11.266 --> 03:13.508
And that was one
of the better ones.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.360
That didn't really happen,
did it?

03:15.512 --> 03:18.605
(chuckles) You don't forget
your first restraining order.

03:18.757 --> 03:20.574
Your first?

03:25.931 --> 03:27.280
Hey, Erica.

03:27.433 --> 03:30.042
Hey. You left your sweatshirt
at my house last night.

03:30.193 --> 03:32.285
Ooh-hoo, my man!

03:32.438 --> 03:34.195
Thanks. You know,
I could have gotten it

03:34.289 --> 03:35.881
next time we see each other.

03:36.032 --> 03:37.624
Yeah, about that...

03:37.793 --> 03:40.201
I don't think there should be
a next time.

03:40.295 --> 03:41.720
My man.

03:41.947 --> 03:43.447
I thought we hit it off.

03:43.540 --> 03:44.631
We did.

03:44.874 --> 03:46.616
And I think you're great,
but I get the feeling

03:46.710 --> 03:49.043
you're looking
for something more serious,

03:49.063 --> 03:51.897
and I'm just in a casual place
right now.

03:51.974 --> 03:53.790
Oh.

03:53.883 --> 03:55.400
Sorry.

03:57.129 --> 03:59.446
This isn't even mine.

04:00.632 --> 04:02.366
It's nice, though.

04:04.060 --> 04:05.652
That's tough. I'm sorry.

04:05.729 --> 04:06.803
Thanks.

04:06.896 --> 04:10.398
Max, party of one,
your table's ready.

04:10.417 --> 04:13.159
-Hey, don't get down.
-Can't help it.

04:13.254 --> 04:15.069
It feels like everyone around me
is pairing up.

04:15.163 --> 04:16.904
Kat and Oscar. You and Randi.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.482
Phil and his new nurse guy.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.167
Oh. And you know lonely Allen
who comes in every night?

04:21.320 --> 04:23.929
Not lonely anymore.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.156
Well, you know what
always makes me feel better

04:26.249 --> 04:27.841
after being rejected by a woman?

04:27.935 --> 04:29.768
-What?
-Checking the mousetraps

04:29.919 --> 04:31.395
and cleaning the bathrooms.

04:34.090 --> 04:35.607
PHIL:
What the hell?!

04:35.684 --> 04:39.169
-What happened?
-I will tell you what happened.

04:39.262 --> 04:42.839
Cat Sajak ripped up my apron!

04:42.841 --> 04:44.116
He's had it out for me

04:44.343 --> 04:47.010
ever since I threw away
one of his favorite toys.

04:47.029 --> 04:49.195
It was a ball of foil.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.680
Get over it.

04:50.699 --> 04:53.458
Why don't you just crumple up
a new ball of foil?

04:53.610 --> 04:56.353
I tried that.
He could tell it was a fake.

04:56.355 --> 04:57.779
(laughs):
Oh, come on, Phil.

04:57.873 --> 04:58.964
Well, you laugh all you want,

04:59.115 --> 05:00.632
but this only means one thing:

05:00.784 --> 05:04.219
I have a cat nemesis.

05:07.308 --> 05:10.392
Great.
Okay, I have things to do.

05:12.538 --> 05:14.295
-Hi.
-RANDI: Hey!

05:14.464 --> 05:16.481
-Did you have any luck?
-Yes. I found the perfect dress

05:16.633 --> 05:18.633
for my dinner
with Oscar and his mom.

05:18.652 --> 05:22.637
It is flame-retardant
and already the color of wine.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.548
-Ooh...
-Smart choice.

05:24.641 --> 05:26.474
I keep telling Katharine it
doesn't matter what she wears--

05:26.493 --> 05:29.286
Oscar's mom
isn't going to like her.

05:30.222 --> 05:31.404
Way to stay on brand, Sheila.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.332
No, no.
Mothers never think anyone

05:33.483 --> 05:35.392
is good enough for their son.

05:35.410 --> 05:37.243
Your Grandma Silver hated me

05:37.338 --> 05:40.172
from the moment she met me
till the day she died.

05:40.323 --> 05:42.156
I swear, at her funeral,

05:42.250 --> 05:44.826
she glared at me
from the casket.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.011
KAT:
Please, Mom,

05:46.162 --> 05:47.679
I'm nervous enough.

05:47.906 --> 05:49.239
I thought I was helping.

05:49.257 --> 05:50.574
Wasn't I helping?

05:50.667 --> 05:52.667
Kat, you don't have anything
to worry about.

05:52.761 --> 05:55.595
Yeah, just be your wonderful,
charming self.

05:55.747 --> 05:57.004
RANDI:
But don't randomly

05:57.024 --> 05:58.415
break into song.

05:58.433 --> 06:00.250
And don't make up lies
to try to impress her.

06:00.268 --> 06:02.027
Ooh, and don't do
an Irish accent,

06:02.254 --> 06:04.696
because it always veers
towards pirate.

06:05.924 --> 06:06.940
Also, don't turn your head.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.350
Your profile is not your friend.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.111
RANDI:
And I can't believe

06:11.263 --> 06:12.429
that I even have to say this,

06:12.522 --> 06:14.856
but don't kick Oscar's mama
in the face.

06:15.024 --> 06:16.208
But again,

06:16.284 --> 06:20.712
the important thing
is to just be yourself.

06:28.872 --> 06:30.389
Just in case.

06:30.616 --> 06:31.948
You're gonna be fine.

06:31.967 --> 06:33.133
Tell that to my armpits.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.209
(high-pitched):
Don't sweat it, guys.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.378
(high-pitched):
Thanks, Oscar.

06:37.398 --> 06:40.315
-Hello, sweetheart.
-Hi, Ma.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.143
Hi. I'm Mary.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.478
Really? 'Cause I don't see
a little lamb! (laughs)

06:45.572 --> 06:47.906
I'm sorry, that was dumb.

06:48.057 --> 06:49.299
Uh, I'm Kat.

06:49.317 --> 06:52.244
So you see a little Kat,
not a little lamb.

06:52.395 --> 06:55.305
I'm gonna stop talking
right now.

06:55.307 --> 06:57.624
You're everything
Oscar said you were.

06:58.977 --> 07:00.160
Why don't we sit down.

07:00.312 --> 07:02.812
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

07:02.906 --> 07:04.147
I'm sorry I'm late.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.149
I couldn't get off the phone
with your<i> abuela.</i>

07:06.151 --> 07:07.317
She never stops.

07:07.410 --> 07:09.152
<i> ¿Cómo enciendo la televisión?</i>

07:09.171 --> 07:10.912
<i> ¿Por qué no me visitas más?</i>

07:10.931 --> 07:12.656
<i> ¿Cómo apaga la televisión?</i>

07:12.749 --> 07:15.675
(forced laughter)

07:15.827 --> 07:16.993
That's so funny.

07:17.012 --> 07:18.995
Oh, you speak Spanish.

07:19.014 --> 07:20.588
Yes, of course I do. I teach it.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.666
I-I mean, I used to. I did.

07:22.759 --> 07:25.760
But it was a whole thing.
Uh, someone died.

07:25.854 --> 07:27.612
And I was in the paper.

07:27.764 --> 07:29.430
I was in<i> el papel.</i>

07:29.450 --> 07:31.508
<i> El periódico.</i>

07:31.526 --> 07:33.510
Right, right, yeah,
I was in that one, too.

07:33.528 --> 07:35.695
Why don't we, uh,
order some appetizers?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.104
In English.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.773
(Irish accent):
Aye, there's a great idea.

07:38.976 --> 07:40.517
We'll start
at the top of the menu.

07:40.535 --> 07:43.444
Ho-ho, shiver me timbers,
brussels sprouts.

07:43.464 --> 07:46.856
Well, that's certainly
a lively take on vegetables.

07:46.875 --> 07:48.708
Let's order some of those.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.694
Oh, uh, let me get
the waiter. You...

07:50.712 --> 07:51.953
Oh! Oh! I am so sorry.

07:52.121 --> 07:53.638
-It's okay. It's just water.
-Let me get in there.

07:53.790 --> 07:55.882
-Oh! Oh, crap.
-OSCAR: Oh! Aw...

07:55.959 --> 07:57.124
Oh, dear.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.603
But I didn't kick her
in the face.

08:04.300 --> 08:05.650
And that month with the tribe
was life-changing.

08:05.802 --> 08:08.545
We had absolutely no contact
with the outside world.

08:08.638 --> 08:11.323
Except that one night I snuck
into town to get a pizza

08:11.474 --> 08:13.550
and check the score
of the Cardinals game.

08:13.643 --> 08:16.143
(laughs)
A woman after my own heart.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.496
Your life is so cool.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.664
Did you always know you wanted
to be a travel writer?

08:19.891 --> 08:22.501
Oh, gosh, no. I was a bookkeeper
until five years ago.

08:22.686 --> 08:24.503
But once my kids were
out of the house,

08:24.730 --> 08:26.079
I was free to follow my dreams.

08:26.231 --> 08:28.081
She likes to remind us
how we held her back.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.175
I call them
"my little ankle weights."

08:30.326 --> 08:31.826
(laughs)

08:31.845 --> 08:33.845
I'm kidding. You know you and
your sisters were the best thing

08:33.997 --> 08:35.238
to ever happen to me.

08:35.257 --> 08:36.740
I'm sure your mother
feels the same.

08:36.833 --> 08:39.759
Uh, I think we'd have to go
to the source on that one.

08:39.911 --> 08:42.428
You know, Ma, Kat kind of did
the same thing as you.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.581
She was a math professor
before she opened the cat café,

08:44.599 --> 08:46.916
and one day she said,
"Screw all of you,

08:47.010 --> 08:48.251
I'm following my dreams."

08:48.270 --> 08:50.177
Actually, I left
everyone in the department

08:50.272 --> 08:52.105
a nice note and a candle,
but yeah.

08:52.257 --> 08:56.368
Look at us, a couple of brave
women rewriting our own stories.

08:56.519 --> 08:57.443
Should we toast?

08:57.596 --> 08:59.204
Ooh, why would we
wave around liquid

08:59.355 --> 09:01.039
when this is going so well?

09:01.190 --> 09:02.523
You're right, you're right.

09:02.692 --> 09:04.601
Again, I'm-I'm sorry about that.
I hope your pants are dry.

09:04.619 --> 09:07.028
Oh, they are.
But speaking of wet pants,

09:07.105 --> 09:08.547
I have a funny story about Oscar

09:08.774 --> 09:11.383
when he was playing a tree
in a school play.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.777
Let's just say
he watered himself.

09:13.870 --> 09:15.445
Ma, Kat doesn't want
to hear that.

09:15.538 --> 09:19.115
Oh, yes, she does. She wants
to hear every single detail.

09:19.134 --> 09:20.617
Honey, I'm having dinner
with your girlfriend

09:20.635 --> 09:22.060
for the first time--
did you really think

09:22.229 --> 09:23.711
we weren't gonna get here?

09:23.730 --> 09:24.896
Fine, but no pictures.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.064
Of course not.

09:26.215 --> 09:27.473
I just AirDropped you the video.

09:27.626 --> 09:29.309
-(gasps)
-Why do you have that
on your phone?

09:29.461 --> 09:32.362
Yeah, and why is it taking me
so long to get it?

09:37.393 --> 09:38.484
How'd it go?

09:38.637 --> 09:40.227
Not well.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.913
Halfway through
the conversation,

09:42.065 --> 09:43.915
she remembered she's a lesbian.

09:44.976 --> 09:46.159
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

09:46.311 --> 09:48.144
Nothing. You're a smoke show.

09:48.163 --> 09:49.813
Maybe it's my breath?

09:49.906 --> 09:51.214
Blow on me.

09:52.150 --> 09:54.150
Ooh. That's minty fresh.

09:54.169 --> 09:55.743
Is it my clothes?

09:55.837 --> 09:57.095
Give me a twirl.

09:57.246 --> 09:58.430
Not gonna lie.

09:58.581 --> 10:00.824
You could bounce a quarter
off that ass, man.

10:00.842 --> 10:02.659
Well, then, what is it?

10:02.752 --> 10:04.418
You got rejected twice. Relax.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.420
No, but it's more than twice.
It's also Jessica.

10:06.498 --> 10:09.532
I've texted her a bunch
and gotten no response.

10:09.592 --> 10:10.925
A bunch?

10:11.019 --> 10:12.986
Show me.

10:14.689 --> 10:15.697
Dude.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.598
-Dude!
-What?

10:17.692 --> 10:19.692
Do you see what my thumb
is doing right now?

10:19.861 --> 10:21.319
It should not
still be doing that.

10:21.471 --> 10:23.680
Well, there was a typo,
so I texted to fix the typo

10:23.698 --> 10:26.941
and then there was a typo in
that, so I text to fix that...

10:26.960 --> 10:28.960
No, this is more
than a typo, okay?

10:29.037 --> 10:31.037
You're coming off
thirsty as hell.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.446
Am not.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.949
Really? 'Cause I'm seeing
a lot of emojis here.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.860
You taught me:
one per exchange.

10:36.862 --> 10:39.362
This looks like
a damn cave painting.

10:39.455 --> 10:41.306
I was just showing her
I was playful.

10:41.457 --> 10:43.975
You were showing her
you were nuts.

10:44.870 --> 10:46.219
I'm not a nut.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.055
I'm just, I'm ready to be
in a relationship again.

10:49.207 --> 10:50.982
I want what I had with Brigitte.

10:51.209 --> 10:52.876
Or what I could have had
with Kat.

10:53.044 --> 10:54.711
And I want that for you, too.

10:54.729 --> 10:56.546
But this is not the way.

10:56.639 --> 10:58.323
Well, I wanted her to know
I'm interested.

10:58.474 --> 11:00.049
You said you were interested
three times,

11:00.143 --> 11:01.885
and the last one you wrote
in all caps.

11:01.903 --> 11:03.662
You know what that sounds like,
right?

11:04.814 --> 11:07.207
I am interested, Jessica!

11:10.245 --> 11:12.729
I swear this cat
is staring at me

11:12.747 --> 11:15.581
like he's Bette Davis
and I'm Joan Crawford.

11:15.734 --> 11:18.551
Yeah, I don't know
who those people are.

11:23.074 --> 11:24.908
What the hell?

11:25.668 --> 11:27.744
Phil, what are you doing?
You're supposed to be folding

11:27.837 --> 11:29.354
the shirts,
not mopping the floor with them.

11:29.581 --> 11:32.190
It's Cat Sajak, I tell you.
He's out to get me.

11:32.341 --> 11:34.767
Aw, Cat Sajak is a good boy.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.920
He's not out to get you.

11:37.013 --> 11:38.271
(Cat Sajak hisses)

11:38.423 --> 11:39.272
(hisses)

11:39.441 --> 11:41.366
Hey, I got a text
from Oscar's mom.

11:41.593 --> 11:44.202
She wants to hang out again,
just with me.

11:44.429 --> 11:45.762
-Oh, that's great!
-Oh...

11:45.780 --> 11:47.021
My "meeting parents" curse
is over.

11:47.098 --> 11:48.623
I'm gonna go pick out an outfit.

11:49.451 --> 11:50.542
KAT:
Oh!

11:50.693 --> 11:51.710
I'm okay.

11:52.528 --> 11:55.029
I love her enthusiasm.

11:55.123 --> 11:58.425
I worry about her safety.

12:00.278 --> 12:01.961
You're very brave
inviting me out for wine

12:02.055 --> 12:03.463
after what happened last time.

12:03.539 --> 12:05.724
Offer still stands for me
to use a sippy cup.

12:05.892 --> 12:09.043
Don't be silly. But I do have
a change of clothes in the car.

12:09.137 --> 12:10.620
(Kat laughs)

12:10.622 --> 12:12.154
This is so good.

12:12.156 --> 12:13.547
I don't even care
that I'll have heartburn

12:13.567 --> 12:16.292
and assume I'm having
a heart attack later.

12:16.385 --> 12:18.069
I have antacids
if you need some.

12:18.221 --> 12:20.813
The trick is to take one
before you start.

12:20.966 --> 12:22.389
(gasps, imitates explosion)

12:22.484 --> 12:24.743
Mary,
you have just rocked my world.

12:24.970 --> 12:26.302
Today is my new birthday!

12:26.395 --> 12:28.413
Kat, you're fun.
I really like you.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.306
I'm so glad.
I really like you, too.

12:30.475 --> 12:33.142
Good. I need you to break up
with my son.

12:33.161 --> 12:35.086
Sure. Wait, what?

12:35.313 --> 12:38.173
You're very nice.
You're just too old for him.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.426
I'm 40. That's the new 20.

12:41.577 --> 12:43.094
Well, by your logic,
my son is ten,

12:43.321 --> 12:44.429
and you should be on a list.

12:44.656 --> 12:47.490
Whoa, whoa! Can you
please not say that so loud?

12:47.509 --> 12:50.009
Listen, I want grandkids,
and I don't see that happening

12:50.161 --> 12:51.344
if Oscar stays with you.

12:51.420 --> 12:52.887
Well, with all due respect,

12:52.998 --> 12:54.272
that's really up
to Oscar and me.

12:54.423 --> 12:55.832
My son lives in the moment.

12:55.850 --> 12:57.183
He doesn't think long-term.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.593
Or have you not seen
his Angry Birds tattoo?

13:00.429 --> 13:01.946
Well, you know,
just so you know,

13:02.098 --> 13:03.782
Halle Berry had
her first kid at 41

13:03.933 --> 13:06.284
and her second kid at--
wait for it-- 47.

13:06.435 --> 13:09.562
Sweetheart,
you're no Halle Berry.

13:09.714 --> 13:13.516
I know that. Or do you think
I'm old<i> and</i> delusional?

13:13.609 --> 13:15.685
I'm just keeping it real.
Things go downhill after 40.

13:15.687 --> 13:18.797
I was already in perimenopause
at your age.

13:19.024 --> 13:20.447
Okay, you've made your point.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.284
Do you get irregular periods,
mood swings, night sweats?

13:23.303 --> 13:25.286
That's your body
closing up shop.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.030
Okay, I think we're done here.

13:27.198 --> 13:28.865
I, uh, I'm gonna go.

13:29.701 --> 13:32.626
For the record,
I'm not ashamed of my emotions,

13:32.720 --> 13:34.461
I've always been a hot sleeper,

13:34.481 --> 13:37.524
and my periods
are regular as rain.

13:38.393 --> 13:40.527
Regular as rain!

13:47.494 --> 13:48.142
Hey.

13:48.236 --> 13:49.661
Hey. How'd it go?

13:50.497 --> 13:53.072
(sighs):
Good. We had a great time.

13:53.224 --> 13:54.833
Your mom is lovely.

13:54.984 --> 13:56.742
Couldn't be lovelier.

13:56.895 --> 13:58.485
The loveliest of lovely.

13:58.580 --> 14:00.563
Just a frickin' delight.

14:00.582 --> 14:02.990
Well, that took a turn.
Uh, what's going on?

14:03.009 --> 14:04.917
Well, uh...

14:05.070 --> 14:08.754
I'm not Halle Berry, and your
mom thinks I'm too old for you.

14:08.907 --> 14:10.590
-Wait, what?
-Yeah.

14:10.742 --> 14:12.684
That's crazy.
You sure that's what she meant?

14:12.835 --> 14:16.412
Well, she said, "I need you
to break up with my son,

14:16.414 --> 14:18.247
I think you're too old for him,"
but, you know,

14:18.266 --> 14:19.765
I could just be reading
into things.

14:19.918 --> 14:21.860
That is so out of line.
I'm calling her right now.

14:21.936 --> 14:25.104
-No, don't. Save your minutes.
-I don't know what that means.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.273
Of course you don't.
You're too young.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.017
(sighs)
What if she's right?

14:30.095 --> 14:31.685
You know,
my age starts with a four,

14:31.705 --> 14:34.263
-and yours starts with a two.
-Kat, I've dated women
my own age,

14:34.282 --> 14:35.598
and it never worked out.

14:35.691 --> 14:37.709
This is the first time
that it feels right.

14:37.860 --> 14:39.711
No, it does feel right.

14:39.862 --> 14:41.546
But the age thing is real.

14:41.773 --> 14:44.365
I'm having a lot of "old people"
things happen to me.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.201
You know, the other day
I tweaked my back sneezing.

14:47.295 --> 14:50.037
Then I made it worse
reaching for a handkerchief.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.298
Yes, I use a handkerchief.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.133
I have to wear glasses
to read small print.

14:54.285 --> 14:55.635
And if I'm being totally honest,

14:55.729 --> 14:57.954
I don't even remember where
I was going with all of this.

14:57.972 --> 14:59.546
You were explaining to me
why you're too old for me.

14:59.715 --> 15:02.049
Right. And it's only gonna
get worse down the road.

15:02.143 --> 15:03.717
Eventually,
my teeth are gonna fall out,

15:03.811 --> 15:06.312
and then you'll have to blend
my food and change my diapers

15:06.464 --> 15:08.814
and help me remember my life,
like in<i> The Notebook.</i>

15:08.891 --> 15:12.243
First, thank you for
comparing me to Ryan Gosling.

15:12.470 --> 15:14.804
Second, let's just slow down.

15:14.822 --> 15:16.897
Can we take this
one day at a time?

15:16.991 --> 15:18.583
But you do have to think
long-term.

15:18.734 --> 15:20.919
Like, what about kids?
You know, I froze my eggs,

15:21.146 --> 15:23.479
but that's not something
I can snooze on.

15:23.498 --> 15:25.531
I'm not even sure I want kids,
and if we decide we do,

15:25.683 --> 15:28.075
there are options:
we can foster, we can adopt.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.652
Maybe we just get some dogs.

15:29.671 --> 15:31.763
-Dogs?!
-Cats, cats.
I mean lots and lots of cats.

15:31.914 --> 15:34.824
Listen,
the one thing I know for sure

15:34.917 --> 15:37.827
is that I want to be with you
for all of it...

15:37.920 --> 15:40.355
'cause I love you.

15:41.090 --> 15:43.399
Wait, what'd you say?

15:44.427 --> 15:47.278
(shouting):
I love you.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.283
I love you, too.

15:53.194 --> 15:55.936
(chuckles):
Wow. We just did that.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.622
We did.

16:00.685 --> 16:03.703
40's turning out to be
a pretty good year.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.855
Wait. You're 40?

16:05.873 --> 16:07.382
(laughs)

16:08.784 --> 16:10.802
-Oscar said it first.
-Oh...

16:10.953 --> 16:12.378
And then I said it back.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.381
It was the first "I love you"
of my life.

16:15.458 --> 16:16.866
Oh, I'm so happy for you, Kat.

16:16.884 --> 16:19.310
I mean, it's gonna be weird
with his mom for a while,

16:19.387 --> 16:21.312
but, you know, I don't need
everyone to like me.

16:21.464 --> 16:22.555
Amen to that.

16:22.707 --> 16:24.131
-(knocking)
-Unrelated:

16:24.209 --> 16:25.483
if you were my boyfriend's mom,

16:25.634 --> 16:27.634
-would you prefer flowers
or chocolate?
-(laughs)

16:28.396 --> 16:30.396
-Hey.
-I know you're closed
for coffee,

16:30.490 --> 16:32.882
but are you open
for an intervention?

16:32.900 --> 16:34.659
Always. Step into our office.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.161
What's up?

16:37.388 --> 16:39.980
What are we intervening?
Drugs? Alcohol?

16:40.074 --> 16:41.499
His boring T-shirts?

16:42.727 --> 16:44.910
Worse. Somebody's taken
our cool, suave Max

16:45.063 --> 16:46.653
and replaced him with this dope.

16:47.598 --> 16:50.341
Wow, you live
in a good school district.

16:50.418 --> 16:52.343
That's where I'd want
my future kids to go.

16:52.495 --> 16:54.161
I mean,
I'm open to homeschooling,

16:54.255 --> 16:57.164
but that's a decision me and my
future wife will have to make.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.683
What do you think?

17:00.745 --> 17:02.503
Why is it so bad
to want to fast-forward

17:02.597 --> 17:05.565
through the chitchat
and get right to the real stuff?

17:06.918 --> 17:08.342
You got a nice smile.

17:08.436 --> 17:10.936
I'd love to take you to
my buddy's cabin in the woods.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.272
It's beautiful there.
Super remote.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.091
No cell service.

17:15.109 --> 17:20.204
Just you and me
in the middle of nowhere.

17:21.616 --> 17:23.207
That was a romantic getaway.

17:23.359 --> 17:25.284
She thought you
were gonna murder her, dude.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.378
She definitely made sure
her Taser was charged.

17:27.530 --> 17:31.440
She had 911 locked and loaded
on her way to the car.

17:31.534 --> 17:34.293
So you're saying
I'm coming on a little strong.

17:34.445 --> 17:37.280
A<i> little</i> strong?
You stink of desperation.

17:37.298 --> 17:38.705
That's what I've been trying
to tell him.

17:38.874 --> 17:40.132
But does he listen? No.

17:40.209 --> 17:42.952
Which is why we are here.

17:43.045 --> 17:45.121
I'm just so sick of dating.

and soul-sucking it is.

17:53.965 --> 17:55.073

Again, I say, "Shh."

17:58.469 --> 18:00.578
You know, Max, maybe
the thing to do right now

18:00.729 --> 18:02.471
is just to stop pushing so hard.

18:02.565 --> 18:06.142
Stop trying to force
something that isn't there.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.476
Well, then, what do I do?

18:07.495 --> 18:09.312
Just keep dating and dating,
with the drinks

18:09.330 --> 18:11.923
and the small talk
and the walks in the park

18:12.074 --> 18:13.499

I wish I could skip straight
to marriage, buy a house,

three is the perfect number.

19:03.125 --> 19:04.559
What do you think?

19:06.128 --> 19:08.271
Yeah, I think my boss needs me.

-Pretty much.

He got adopted this morning.

Good riddance.
