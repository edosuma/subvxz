00:58.659 --> 01:00.392
Ha-har!

01:01.461 --> 01:02.995
Ahoy, mateys!

01:02.997 --> 01:05.731
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:07.033 --> 01:08.067
Great!

01:08.069 --> 01:09.735
To start today's adventure,

01:09.737 --> 01:12.504
everybody say
the Pirate Password.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.206
Yo-ho-ho!

01:14.208 --> 01:16.208
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:16.210 --> 01:17.743
One more time.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.812
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:23.216 --> 01:25.484
<i>[Jake] Follow the</i>
<i>Bouncin' Bumble!</i>

01:26.386 --> 01:28.487
[Bones] Thar she is, cap'n!

01:28.489 --> 01:32.624
Just like I told ya...
The Bumble Bungalow.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.027
Home to them
Bouncy Bumbles.

01:35.029 --> 01:38.530
And you're positive
there's treasure in there?

01:38.532 --> 01:41.300
Ooh... A golden
treasure, cap'n.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.268
Step lively, boys.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.603
But beware, cap'n!

01:44.605 --> 01:48.140
The Bumbles' Golden Treasure
is guarded by their Queen!

01:48.142 --> 01:52.744
Pish posh! I've no fear
of any bumbling bug...

01:52.746 --> 01:54.913
Save me, Smee!

01:54.915 --> 01:56.782
[shouting]

01:56.784 --> 01:59.351
[grunting]

02:01.087 --> 02:03.789
Oh, I'm afraid
your buggy plan,

02:03.791 --> 02:06.358
though brilliant,
didn't work, cap'n.

02:06.360 --> 02:11.697
Perhaps, but I've got
an even better idea.

02:13.967 --> 02:17.970
Woo-hoo! Buccaneer Beach
Volleyball's the best!

02:17.972 --> 02:20.973
Get ready!
Here comes a big one!

02:20.975 --> 02:22.641
I got it! I got it!

02:22.643 --> 02:23.876
Huh?

02:23.878 --> 02:26.245
That's no volleyball.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.180
- It's a Bouncy Bumble!
- [buzzing]

02:28.182 --> 02:31.183
He's really far away
from Big Bug Valley!

02:31.185 --> 02:32.618
What's he doing here?

02:32.620 --> 02:36.588
I don't know, but he sure
seems upset about somethin'!

02:36.590 --> 02:38.390
[buzzing]

02:38.392 --> 02:41.160
C'mon, mateys, let's
follow the Bouncy Bumble

02:41.162 --> 02:43.795
and find out what's going on
in Big Bug Valley!

02:43.797 --> 02:45.964
Keep a look out
for gold doubloons.

02:45.966 --> 02:49.334
Whenever we solve a
pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.604
Then we'll collect 'em
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.640
Is everybody ready?

02:54.642 --> 02:57.476
- I've got my sword.
- I got my map!

02:57.478 --> 02:59.978
And I've got my pixie dust.

02:59.980 --> 03:03.415
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.484
But only in emergencies.

03:07.086 --> 03:10.155
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

03:10.157 --> 03:12.658
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

03:12.660 --> 03:14.426
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

03:14.428 --> 03:17.796
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

03:17.798 --> 03:20.566
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

03:20.568 --> 03:22.701
<i>¶ And me </i>

03:25.572 --> 03:28.106
Are we getting closer
to your home, Bouncer?

03:28.108 --> 03:29.641
[buzzing]

03:29.643 --> 03:32.477
Bouncer?
Is that his name?

03:32.479 --> 03:34.179
It is now.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.148
Look alive, me hearties!

03:36.150 --> 03:39.184
More Bouncy Bumbles,
bouncin' ahead!

03:39.186 --> 03:43.488
[giggles]
You look silly, Sharky!

03:43.490 --> 03:45.123
[Sharky]
Right back at ya, matey.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.159
Shiver me timbers!

03:47.161 --> 03:49.628
There is something
fishy going on here.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.364
Yeah! Those aren't
Bouncy Bumbles!

03:52.366 --> 03:55.300
Are you sure
this will work, cap'n?

03:55.302 --> 03:59.304
Just bounce around like
those blasted bugs.

03:59.306 --> 04:04.009
Then we shall bumble past them
and find their Golden Treasure.

04:04.011 --> 04:07.012
Now, bounce lively!

04:07.014 --> 04:09.214
- [Sharky] Boingy-boingy!
- [Bones] Bumbles we be!

04:09.216 --> 04:11.650
No wonder
Bouncer is so upset.

04:11.652 --> 04:15.320
It looks like Captain Hook
is going after the
Bouncy Bumbles' treasure!

04:15.322 --> 04:17.923
We gotta stop him and
help our new matey!

04:17.925 --> 04:20.259
But we're not
Bouncing Bumbles!

04:20.261 --> 04:22.928
What if they get upset when
they see us in their home?

04:22.930 --> 04:25.664
[buzzes]

04:25.666 --> 04:28.600
I think Bouncer wants us
to stay close to him.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.335
Then we'll be OK!

04:30.337 --> 04:32.137
Yo-ho, let's go!

04:32.139 --> 04:38.010
So, Bones, where is
this Golden Treasure
I've heard so much about?

04:38.012 --> 04:40.912
The treasure should be
with the Queen, cap'n.

04:40.914 --> 04:44.016
Right smack in the middle
o' their little bungalow.

04:44.018 --> 04:45.684
Splendid!

04:45.686 --> 04:49.921
Just keep moving forward and
the bugs won't even notice us.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.823
Be careful, sir!

04:51.825 --> 04:54.660
The floor seems to be
covered with Bumblewax!

04:54.662 --> 04:57.629
It's very slippery and slide'y!

04:57.631 --> 05:01.133
- Nonsense!
- [buzzing]

05:02.568 --> 05:04.369
<i>¶ Don't you stumble </i>

05:04.371 --> 05:06.705
<i>¶ Just bounce along</i>
<i>with that Bouncy Bumble ¶</i>

05:06.707 --> 05:10.942
<i>¶ Follow the Bouncing Bumble</i>
<i>as we go ¶</i>

05:10.944 --> 05:13.078
<i>¶ We're in cahoots</i>
<i>in Bumble Suits ¶</i>

05:13.080 --> 05:15.380
<i>¶ Until that XXXX </i>

05:15.382 --> 05:19.718
¶ And when their belly bouncin'
bumble XXXX about ¶

05:19.720 --> 05:21.787
<i>¶ So we might bumble </i>

05:21.789 --> 05:24.323
<i>¶ Just follow along</i>
<i>with those Bouncy Bumbles ¶</i>

05:24.325 --> 05:27.626
<i>¶ Bounce along with those</i>
<i>Bumbles to and fro ¶</i>

05:27.628 --> 05:30.162
<i>¶ Bounce along with them</i>
<i>Bumbles to and fro... ¶</i>

05:30.164 --> 05:31.563
Hook's gettin' away!

05:31.565 --> 05:32.698
<i>¶ Here we go </i>

05:32.700 --> 05:34.099
Wait a minute!

05:34.101 --> 05:37.736
How can we go after Hook
without slippin' and slidin'?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.237
I've got an idea.

05:39.239 --> 05:43.141
We can skate across,
just like ice skaters!

05:43.143 --> 05:47.646
Glide this way! Glide that way!

05:47.648 --> 05:51.249
Glide, glide, glide!

05:51.251 --> 05:52.784
[all giggling]

05:52.786 --> 05:56.254
- Woo-hoo!
- Yay-hey!

05:56.256 --> 06:00.158
We skated across the floor
and got two gold doubloons!

06:00.160 --> 06:03.729
Let's grab 'em and go catch up
to that bumblin' Captain Hook!

06:06.999 --> 06:10.869
I remember from me
Big Book of Bouncy Bumbles,

06:10.871 --> 06:14.840
this maze will take us straight
to the Queen's Chamber!

06:14.842 --> 06:18.143
Oh, I have a feeling
this isn't going to go well.

06:18.145 --> 06:21.179
Just follow me and stick close!

06:25.852 --> 06:28.520
Sharky? Bones?

06:28.522 --> 06:31.223
Mr. Smee? [echoing]

06:31.225 --> 06:33.258
Help!

06:33.260 --> 06:36.795
I'm lost! Save me, Smee!

06:36.797 --> 06:39.464
- [Smee] Oh, dear!
- [Bones] I want me mummy!

06:39.466 --> 06:42.667
Sounds like Captain Hook
and his crew are lost.

06:42.669 --> 06:46.772
Well, we won't get lost
as long as we follow Bouncer!

06:46.774 --> 06:48.807
Yay-hey, lead the way!

06:48.809 --> 06:49.808
- [buzzing]
- [Bones] Sharky?

06:49.810 --> 06:51.843
[Cubby]
Right behind you, Bouncer.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.346
[Bones]
Right behind you, Sharky!

06:54.348 --> 06:55.514
[Hook] Help me, someone!

06:55.516 --> 06:57.916
[Izzy] I think
we're almost there!

06:58.885 --> 07:00.252
Thanks Bouncer.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.254
We got through
the maze together,

07:02.256 --> 07:04.723
and we got three more
gold doubloons!

07:04.725 --> 07:06.224
Let's grab 'em and...

07:06.226 --> 07:09.594
Ahoy there, little pirate pals!

07:09.596 --> 07:13.398
- Have ye by chance seen...
- I found you!

07:13.400 --> 07:15.333
I'm saved! I'm saved!

07:15.335 --> 07:19.738
And what are you
puny pirates doing here, anyway?

07:19.740 --> 07:23.875
Stopping you from
swiping the treasure
of the Bouncy Bumbles!

07:23.877 --> 07:26.244
Is that so?

07:26.246 --> 07:30.749
Well, my Bouncy Bumbles
might have something
to say about that.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.684
Bounce on, boys!

07:32.686 --> 07:37.189
[all shouting]

07:37.191 --> 07:38.790
Come on, crew!

07:38.792 --> 07:40.959
[all whooping]

07:46.265 --> 07:47.766
Who goes there?

07:47.768 --> 07:50.168
It is I, Captain Hoo...

07:50.170 --> 07:53.338
I mean, Captain Bumble!

07:53.340 --> 07:57.943
I don't recall ever seeing
youzzz guyzzz here before.

07:57.945 --> 08:01.513
Me Bumbles and I
have been busy as bees,

08:01.515 --> 08:04.916
making sure that
no thievin' pirates...

08:04.918 --> 08:07.219
Pirate thievezzz?

08:07.221 --> 08:09.120
Here?!
Where are they?

08:09.122 --> 08:12.257
[kids whooping]

08:12.259 --> 08:16.661
There they are,
your Bumble-ness!
The scoundrels!

08:16.663 --> 08:18.763
Pirate thievezzz!

08:18.765 --> 08:22.801
How dare you even think of
stealing my Golden Treasure!

08:22.803 --> 08:24.836
We're not thieves,
your Highness!

08:24.838 --> 08:27.272
I'm Jake, and this is my crew.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.341
[buzzing]

08:29.343 --> 08:32.277
Bumble Guards, let them be.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.981
My loyal Bumble here says
that you all are good friends

08:35.983 --> 08:38.984
and you know what?
Any friend of a Bumble

08:38.986 --> 08:41.152
is a friend of mine!

08:41.154 --> 08:44.422
Aw, coconuts, thanks,
your Bounci-ness.

08:44.424 --> 08:48.059
We're here to stop Captain Hook
from stealing your treasure.

08:48.061 --> 08:52.030
Well, as you all can see
with your very own eyes,

08:52.032 --> 08:55.267
my Golden Treasure
is perfectly...

08:55.269 --> 08:58.336
[gasping] Gone!

08:58.338 --> 09:01.806
There's your pirate thief...
Captain Hook!

09:01.808 --> 09:04.776
No puny pirate or big bug

09:04.778 --> 09:07.679
will ever stop me
from getting treasure!

09:07.681 --> 09:09.314
Haha!

09:09.316 --> 09:10.682
[grunts]

09:10.684 --> 09:14.786
Oh no! This can't be
happening to me!

09:14.788 --> 09:17.956
Don't worry, your Majesty.
We'll get your Treasure back!

09:17.958 --> 09:19.457
Come on, mateys!

09:19.459 --> 09:23.795
[laughs] The Golden Treasure
is right where it belongs...

09:23.797 --> 09:26.231
...with me.

09:26.233 --> 09:30.802
Behold, a chest filled to
the brim with golden...

09:30.804 --> 09:32.370
Honey?!

09:32.372 --> 09:35.540
That's the Golden Treasure?

09:35.542 --> 09:38.510
Aye, cap'n!
Isn't it great?

09:38.512 --> 09:42.047
All the honey
you could ever dream of!

09:42.049 --> 09:45.116
What am I going to do
with a chest full of honey?!

09:45.118 --> 09:48.453
Blast!

09:48.455 --> 09:49.955
[Skully] Shiver me timbers!

09:49.957 --> 09:53.024
The Bumble Bungalow's
goin' down!

09:53.026 --> 09:55.860
Izzy, this is
one big emergency!

09:55.862 --> 09:59.197
Then it's...
pixie dust away!

10:03.869 --> 10:06.171
[all] Yo-ho, way to go!

10:06.173 --> 10:08.239
We saved the Bumbles' Bungalow,

10:08.241 --> 10:10.809
and we got four more
gold doubloons!

10:10.811 --> 10:14.179
Let's grab 'em and go return
the Bumble Queen's treasure!

10:15.581 --> 10:18.850
What are you smiling
about, ya big bug?

10:18.852 --> 10:21.419
- [whistles]
- [trumpeting]

10:23.122 --> 10:27.158
Again Mr. Smee. Save me!

10:30.930 --> 10:34.532
My new pirate friendzzz,
I love ya!

10:34.534 --> 10:37.969
I want to thank you for saving
all my Golden Treasure.

10:37.971 --> 10:42.140
So, guess what?
Honey for everybody!

10:42.142 --> 10:43.375
Thanks!

10:43.377 --> 10:45.110
[buzzing]

10:46.679 --> 10:49.214
Thanks for helping the
Bouncing Bumbles, mateys!

10:49.216 --> 10:51.182
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons

10:51.184 --> 10:53.318
into our Team Treasure Chest.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.028
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:03.030 --> 11:05.030

11:07.067 --> 11:09.834
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

11:09.836 --> 11:12.237
Come on. Count with us.

11:13.105 --> 11:14.839
[all] Yeah!

11:15.841 --> 11:17.342

11:19.846 --> 11:23.081

pirate problems today

11:26.286 --> 11:29.220

11:29.222 --> 11:32.791
And I've got a tasty treat
for everybody...

11:32.793 --> 11:34.759
Honey Cupcakes!

11:34.761 --> 11:36.895
[all] Sweet!

11:38.664 --> 11:42.400
I hope I never see
another gob of honey.

11:42.402 --> 11:46.471
Nothing that
tastes sweet, smells sweet,

11:46.473 --> 11:48.873
or even looks sweet!

11:48.875 --> 11:50.442
[Smee] Oh, cap'n.

11:50.444 --> 11:54.212
I've got just the thing
to cheer you up!

11:54.214 --> 11:56.581
[chuckling] Fresh from the oven!

11:56.583 --> 11:58.983
What in Never Land is that?

11:58.985 --> 12:03.922
Why, it's my world
famous honey cake...

12:03.924 --> 12:07.726
Mr. Smee, that's a
seagulls favorite food!

12:09.929 --> 12:11.763
Blast.

12:14.266 --> 12:16.668
<i>[Izzy] Sandy and the Clams.</i>

12:18.237 --> 12:19.938
<i>¶ Ba-ba-boo! </i>

12:19.940 --> 12:22.707
¶ Little lobster little lobster

12:22.709 --> 12:26.377

12:26.379 --> 12:29.114
¶ Little lobster little lobster

12:31.351 --> 12:35.120
<i>¶ You're a crimson jewel</i>
<i>in the Never Sea ¶</i>

12:35.122 --> 12:38.323
<i>¶ A red red ruby pearl! </i>

12:38.325 --> 12:42.293
<i>¶ Little lobster</i>
<i>Little lobster girl ¶</i>

12:42.295 --> 12:44.028

¶ She's got the prettiest smile
and the darkest eyes ¶

12:47.834 --> 12:50.401
<i>¶ The one that I adore! </i>

12:50.403 --> 12:53.938

13:23.170 --> 13:25.203
[all cheering]

13:25.205 --> 13:29.174
Ba-ba-boo! Thank you!
You're too kind. Ba-boo.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.542
Thank you, Never Land!

13:30.544 --> 13:32.343
We're here till
the tide changes!

13:32.345 --> 13:33.545
Love ya!

13:33.547 --> 13:36.281
Marina, that was awesome!

13:36.283 --> 13:39.951
Stormy and I knew you guys
would love Sandy and the Clams!

13:39.953 --> 13:43.188
They're the hottest new singing
group on land or under water!

13:43.190 --> 13:44.856
[Sandy] One more time, ba-boo.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.828
<i>¶ Ba-ba-boo!</i>
<i>Little lobster ¶</i>

13:49.830 --> 13:52.397
<i>¶ Ba-boo little lobster... </i>

13:52.399 --> 13:56.334
Oh, a catchy tune indeed.

13:56.336 --> 13:59.404
Oh! It's so toe-tappy!

13:59.406 --> 14:01.673
But who be makin' the music?

14:01.675 --> 14:07.412
Bah! It's just the babbling
of those puny pirates and
their water-logged playmates.

14:07.414 --> 14:08.780
Ignore it!

14:08.782 --> 14:10.748
There's important
work to be done!

14:10.750 --> 14:13.384
I need buckets of seashells!

14:13.386 --> 14:16.955
Shells to decorate
the pirate picnic
you're hosting...

14:16.957 --> 14:18.690
for Red Jessica!

14:18.692 --> 14:21.860
Ah, Red Jessica.

14:21.862 --> 14:26.931
She's as lovely as a schooner
under full sail! Huh?!

14:26.933 --> 14:28.299
[grunts]

14:28.301 --> 14:30.835
[Skully] Crackers! Incoming!

14:33.572 --> 14:36.007
- Coconuts!
- Look alive!

14:36.009 --> 14:37.909
Mama Mackerel!

14:37.911 --> 14:41.045
- Gotcha Sandy!
- Who's rockin'
the boat, ba-boo?

14:41.047 --> 14:44.782
- [gasps] The clams!
- Where'd they go?

14:44.784 --> 14:48.386
Whoa! Clamabunga!

14:50.289 --> 14:53.558
Oh my! Those are pretty shells!

14:53.560 --> 14:56.928
There they are! Next to
Mr. Smee on the beach.

14:56.930 --> 15:00.832
Perfect decorations,
they be! [chuckling]

15:00.834 --> 15:04.769
Yo-ho, oh no!
The clams are in
Mr. Smee's bucket!

15:04.771 --> 15:07.105
And he's leaving
with Captain Hook!

15:07.107 --> 15:09.007
What does Hook
want with the clams?

15:09.009 --> 15:11.476
Ever heard of clam chowder?

15:11.478 --> 15:15.313
I don't know about that,
but we've gotta
get the clams back!

15:15.315 --> 15:18.683
Mateys, will you help us
bring back the singing clams

15:18.685 --> 15:20.551
so they can finish
their concert?

15:22.288 --> 15:23.621
Great!

15:23.623 --> 15:25.990
Keep a look out
for gold doubloons.

15:25.992 --> 15:29.527
Whenever we solve a
pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.563
Then we'll collect 'em
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.699
Yo-ho, let's go!

15:34.701 --> 15:37.268
Ba-ba-boo!
I'm going with you, too.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.270
Good luck!

15:42.408 --> 15:45.576
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

15:45.578 --> 15:47.979
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

15:47.981 --> 15:49.347
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

15:49.349 --> 15:52.817
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

15:52.819 --> 15:55.653
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>

15:55.655 --> 15:57.455
<i>¶ And me </i>

15:57.457 --> 16:00.825
<i>¶ And me too, ba-ba-boo </i>

16:03.128 --> 16:05.096
[Smee giggling]

16:07.099 --> 16:10.435
Ah, there. All done.

16:10.437 --> 16:15.373
Hurry, men! Hurry!
Red Jessica will be
here at any moment!

16:15.375 --> 16:19.243
Everything about this picnic
must be pure perfection!

16:19.245 --> 16:22.180
Well, the decorations are done!

16:22.182 --> 16:25.917
And they look lovely,
if I do say so myself!

16:25.919 --> 16:28.853
And the food? I-is it ready?

16:28.855 --> 16:32.223
Ah. I hope we're
having pizza, dude!

16:33.392 --> 16:36.728
How dare you make fun
of me picnic!

16:36.730 --> 16:38.529
I didn't say a word, sir.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.365
Uh, not me, neither.

16:40.367 --> 16:44.168
Zip it, guys. Or we'll all
end up in the clam dip.

16:44.170 --> 16:49.207
I want no more shenanigans
when Red Jessica arrives.

16:49.209 --> 16:52.744
For after she and
I have feasted...

16:52.746 --> 16:56.080
I am going to give her this!

16:56.082 --> 16:59.417
Oh, what beautiful red pearls!

16:59.419 --> 17:02.987
Ah, pearls are the perfect
accessory for formal wear

17:02.989 --> 17:04.655
or casual attire.

17:04.657 --> 17:08.092
That's what I was thinking!
She can wear them with...

17:08.094 --> 17:10.028
who said that?!

17:10.030 --> 17:12.597
[Jessica] Oh James!

17:12.599 --> 17:14.465
I'm here!

17:14.467 --> 17:18.703
Welcome, m'lady,
to Pleasant Peak!

17:18.705 --> 17:21.439
I can see why
you asked me here.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.841
Just look at the view.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.144
[Hook] Spectacular, is it not?

17:26.146 --> 17:28.479
Why on a clear day
you can see...

17:28.481 --> 17:31.015
- [Skully] Woo-hoo!
- [Jake] Yo-ho, let's go!

17:31.017 --> 17:32.450
Aye-aye, Jake!

17:32.452 --> 17:34.318
Smee!

17:35.721 --> 17:37.755
You bellowed, sir?

17:37.757 --> 17:40.491
If you please,
show Red Jessica the view

17:40.493 --> 17:42.226
from the other side of the peak.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.763
I have a small errand
I must attend to.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.098
Aye, cap'n.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.699
Way to go, Skully!

17:48.701 --> 17:51.602
It took a sharp lookout
to spot Hook way up there.

17:51.604 --> 17:55.373
You there!
I've got no patience
for puny pirates today!

17:55.375 --> 17:56.741
Go away!

17:56.743 --> 17:59.677
[laughs] Well, ahoy to
you too, Captain Hook.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.780
We're here because when your
men were collecting shells...

18:02.782 --> 18:05.983
Get your own shells
somewhere else!

18:05.985 --> 18:08.820
In other words... go away!

18:10.355 --> 18:12.790
Whoa! Step lively, mateys!

18:12.792 --> 18:15.626
Rolling coconuts!

18:15.628 --> 18:17.628
Whoa, hang on, Sandy!

18:17.630 --> 18:19.430
Heads up, mateys!

18:19.432 --> 18:20.832
[shouting]

18:20.834 --> 18:22.133
Gotcha!

18:23.602 --> 18:25.803
All ashore who's goin' ashore!

18:25.805 --> 18:28.639
Wow! That was close!

18:28.641 --> 18:30.007
Too close!

18:30.009 --> 18:32.977
All right! We saved
Cubby and Sandy,

18:32.979 --> 18:35.546
and we got four
gold doubloons.

18:35.548 --> 18:39.150
Let's grab 'em and
go get the clams!

18:39.152 --> 18:41.986
So, how are we gonna
get to the top?

18:41.988 --> 18:44.255
Well, if Hook won't
let us use the trail,

18:44.257 --> 18:46.757
there's gotta be
another way up there.

18:46.759 --> 18:49.127
And there it is! See?

18:49.129 --> 18:53.164
All we gotta do is hop from rock
to rock till we get to the top!

18:54.900 --> 18:58.669
James, you've thought of
everything to make
a perfect evening.

18:58.671 --> 19:03.407
This party's a real snore!
They should play some game!

19:03.409 --> 19:05.176
Maybe the limbo!

19:05.178 --> 19:07.745
Oh! Limbo!
I love to limbo!

19:07.747 --> 19:09.814
Would you guys clam up?!

19:10.749 --> 19:13.451
Mm. This pirate punch
is delightful!

19:13.453 --> 19:17.588
Oh, there's still something
very special to come!

19:17.590 --> 19:21.359
But first we must
have... music!!

19:21.361 --> 19:24.829
[stuttering] What kind of music?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.097
A tango!

19:26.099 --> 19:28.733
[both] A pirate tango it is!

19:28.735 --> 19:32.103
Hit it, boys.

19:32.105 --> 19:36.607
Madame, may I have
this dance?

19:36.609 --> 19:39.076
But of course, Captain.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.554
We did it!
We made it to the top!

19:49.556 --> 19:52.223
Yay-hey! We hopped
up to the peak,

19:52.225 --> 19:54.959
and we got three more
gold doubloons.

19:54.961 --> 19:58.896
Let's grab 'em and go
get our clammy mates.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.432
Check it out, crew!

20:01.434 --> 20:03.734
The clams are straight ahead!

20:03.736 --> 20:09.707
[gasps] No! Those scurvy
swabs will ruin everything!

20:09.709 --> 20:14.245
[yelling] Oh, James...

20:14.247 --> 20:19.850
[panting] Why won't you puny
pirates leave me alone?!

20:19.852 --> 20:21.886
[tango continues]

20:21.888 --> 20:23.854
We'll go as soon
as you give us...

20:23.856 --> 20:26.490
Ah ha! I should have known!

20:26.492 --> 20:30.428
You've been after
the pearl necklace
all this time!

20:30.430 --> 20:35.199
To think you would
run off with me gift
for Red Jessica!

20:35.201 --> 20:37.335
Yay-hey, no way!

20:37.337 --> 20:40.171
We don't want that necklace,
we want...

20:40.173 --> 20:41.906
I don't care
what you want.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.809
I only care
about what I want.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.877
[Hook grunts]

20:46.879 --> 20:49.180
[Clam chuckles] Awesome!

20:49.182 --> 20:50.748
Oh dear.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.017
Shiver me cliffhangers!

20:53.019 --> 20:55.519
This is an emergency!
Pixie dust away!

20:57.055 --> 20:59.991
Oh no, what have I done.

20:59.993 --> 21:01.659
[Clam] Woo-hoo!

21:01.661 --> 21:04.362
Gotcha! And the pearls, too.

21:04.364 --> 21:07.598
All right! We saved the clams.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.368
and we got three more
gold doubloons!

21:10.370 --> 21:13.371
Let's grab 'em and go
bring 'em back home!

21:14.273 --> 21:16.607
Here you go, Captain Hook.

21:16.609 --> 21:20.111
[giggles] I hope Red Jessica
likes her new pearls.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.747
I, uh...

21:22.749 --> 21:24.115
thank you?

21:24.117 --> 21:25.716
[Jessica laughing] Ah, James.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.818
Haven't you forgotten something?

21:29.755 --> 21:33.324
Thanks for helping us bring
back Sandy's clams, mateys.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.192
Now let's count
our gold doubloons

21:35.194 --> 21:37.361
and put them in our
Team Treasure Chest.

21:44.569 --> 21:46.804
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:46.806 --> 21:48.839
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

21:48.841 --> 21:50.875
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

21:50.877 --> 21:53.811
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

21:53.813 --> 21:56.113
Come on. Count with us.

21:56.915 --> 21:58.649
[all] Yeah!

21:59.718 --> 22:03.287
[Jake] One, two, three, four...

22:03.289 --> 22:05.956
[Cubby] Five, six, seven...

22:05.958 --> 22:08.893
[Izzy] Eight, nine, ten.

22:08.895 --> 22:12.063
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today

22:12.065 --> 22:14.365
we got 10 gold doubloons!

22:15.667 --> 22:18.436
And I learned a new dance...

22:18.438 --> 22:20.504
...The Pirate Tango!

22:20.506 --> 22:23.274
[all laughing]

22:26.945 --> 22:28.913
<i>¶ Ba-ba-boo! </i>

22:28.915 --> 22:30.648
<i>- ¶ Little lobster </i>
<i>- ¶ Ba-boo </i>

22:30.650 --> 22:33.684
- ¶ Little lobster
- ¶ My little lobster girl...

22:33.686 --> 22:36.687
James, I can't believe you
got your little friends

22:36.689 --> 22:41.659
to sing that wonderful song
in honor of me and my red hair.

22:41.661 --> 22:44.061
Well, er, ah....

22:44.063 --> 22:46.931
Nothing is too good
for you, me dear.

22:46.933 --> 22:49.300
Including this...

22:49.302 --> 22:53.137
Oh you sweet rascal!

22:53.139 --> 22:57.007
Oh, the cap'n's blushing.

22:57.009 --> 22:59.610
He's as red as
her hair, he is.

22:59.612 --> 23:03.614
[Sharky chuckles]
Now he's a lobster boy!

23:04.716 --> 23:06.751
[up-tempo music]

23:06.753 --> 23:08.152
<i>¶ I spy </i>

23:08.154 --> 23:11.989
Keep a lookout now, mateys!
And don't forget your spyglass.

23:13.925 --> 23:16.060
<i>¶ Keep an eye out</i>
<i>for your mateys ¶</i>

23:16.062 --> 23:17.495
<i>¶ And sharply watch below </i>

23:17.497 --> 23:21.198
<i>¶ When stormy blows the sea </i>

23:21.200 --> 23:23.434
<i>¶ 'Cause your crew</i>
<i>is counting on you ¶</i>

23:23.436 --> 23:25.336
<i>¶ To guide them safely home </i>

23:25.338 --> 23:28.339
<i>¶ The lookout mate you be </i>

23:29.408 --> 23:33.010
¶ With my spyglass I can spy

23:33.012 --> 23:38.649
¶ With my weather eye
with the flash of my spyglass ¶

23:38.651 --> 23:40.551
<i>¶ I can see </i>

23:40.553 --> 23:42.119
<i>¶ Two hundreds league away </i>

23:42.121 --> 23:43.854
<i>¶ I can help us navigate </i>

23:43.856 --> 23:48.192
<i>¶ Across the Never Sea</i>
<i>my spyglass spies for me ¶</i>

23:48.194 --> 23:49.894
I spy a crooked Hook

23:49.896 --> 23:51.495
with my weather eye.

23:51.497 --> 23:53.397
But Jolly Roger's settin' sail

23:53.399 --> 23:55.366
so mateys look alive.

23:55.368 --> 23:59.103
I spy the tail of a whale
swimming off the bow.

23:59.105 --> 24:02.773
The big beluga says ahoy
by splashing all around.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.642
Ha-har!
