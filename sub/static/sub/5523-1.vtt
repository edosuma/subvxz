WEBVTT

01:53.286 --> 01:54.788
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.207
Mr. Doria? Virginia Goodman.

02:59.458 --> 03:02.003
I was sent by your
lawyer, Felix Leiva.

03:03.748 --> 03:04.749
A pleasure.

03:06.197 --> 03:07.949
- Come in.
- Thanks.

03:10.818 --> 03:13.821
- Give me two minutes to get dressed.
- Sure.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.826
By members of armed groups
that have demobilized

03:20.993 --> 03:23.871
and are contributing to
the search for the missing.

03:24.723 --> 03:27.518
In national news, the
main news this morning

03:27.711 --> 03:30.381
is the funeral held in
memory of Laura Vidal,

03:30.628 --> 03:33.005
the renowned photographer
and visual artist,

03:33.172 --> 03:35.857
allegedly murdered by
her lover, Adrian Doria,

03:36.014 --> 03:38.178
recently awarded
in the prestigious

03:38.202 --> 03:41.038
European Awards for Innovation
and Business Development

03:41.305 --> 03:42.884
as businessman of the year.

03:43.035 --> 03:45.824
Doria, who recently made
inroads into the Asian market

03:45.848 --> 03:47.902
with his company
Global Go Tech Media,

03:48.122 --> 03:51.690
is pleading innocent and states
he is the victim of a plot.

03:53.027 --> 03:54.903
I was expecting you later.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.279
Yes. We've had a setback.

03:57.459 --> 04:00.041
I tried to talk to Felix,
but his phone's off.

04:00.065 --> 04:00.895
He's out of town.

04:00.919 --> 04:05.360
But he said everything was under
control, that he had a lead...

04:05.384 --> 04:07.213
- That would change everything, yes.
- Exactly.

04:07.237 --> 04:09.237
That's what he said when
I last spoke to him.

04:09.375 --> 04:11.102
But I didn't know
then what I do now,

04:11.591 --> 04:12.854
and what he still doesn't know.

04:12.878 --> 04:13.671
What?

04:13.838 --> 04:16.480
It's very likely you'll be
called to testify tonight.

04:16.504 --> 04:17.211
What?

04:17.235 --> 04:18.995
One of my courthouse
sources says

04:19.019 --> 04:21.105
the prosecutor has a
last-minute witness

04:21.283 --> 04:23.536
who could turn your case around.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.261
We don't know who it is yet,

04:25.285 --> 04:27.116
but they're being
taken to the court

04:27.390 --> 04:29.584
to testify in three hours.

04:29.831 --> 04:30.832
I told the truth.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.531
Your testimony has holes,

04:34.012 --> 04:35.274
and I need details.

04:36.986 --> 04:39.196
Plausibility is
based on details.

04:39.530 --> 04:42.283
I can use them to convince the
world that you're innocent.

04:43.305 --> 04:44.849
I assure you, I can do it.

04:45.327 --> 04:49.123
So far I've never lost
a case before any judge.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.709
But I need you to cooperate.

04:52.418 --> 04:54.875
The police have turned
this place into a cell.

04:54.899 --> 04:56.065
I'm watched 24 hours a day.

04:56.991 --> 04:58.808
Don't you think if I
had anything to add

04:58.832 --> 05:00.277
I would've done it by now?

05:00.301 --> 05:03.472
They're going to request your
immediate arrest, Mr. Doria.

05:03.496 --> 05:06.082
We have 180 minutes
to start over,

05:06.348 --> 05:09.977
so I advise you to stop
whining and let's get to work.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.615
Right, let's go
back to the start.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.115
What were you and the
deceased doing at that hotel?

05:35.795 --> 05:37.171
We were told to go there.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.760
We'd been seeing each
other for a few months.

05:43.723 --> 05:46.180
Someone was trying
to blackmail us.

05:46.853 --> 05:48.772
We were following
their instructions.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.666
They wanted 100,000 Euros.

05:51.973 --> 05:53.595
It's better to buy
someone's silence

05:53.619 --> 05:55.112
than face a
million-dollar divorce.

05:55.136 --> 05:57.810
I never wanted to divorce
Sonia, I love her.

05:57.834 --> 06:00.953
Why that hotel, 200 miles
away from your lives?

06:01.213 --> 06:02.213
I don't know.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.509
Weren't you surprised they chose
somewhere so out of the way?

06:05.533 --> 06:07.076
Who cares which hotel it was?

06:07.243 --> 06:09.107
Had you and your lover
been there before?

06:09.131 --> 06:11.736
The problem here is someone
pinned a murder on me.

06:12.857 --> 06:14.570
Everything is
important, Mr. Doria.

06:16.545 --> 06:17.545
But it's alright,

06:18.865 --> 06:21.379
first let's talk about
the message on your phone.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.962
We'd been waiting for
two hours when it came.

06:47.404 --> 06:48.404
Something wrong?

06:53.873 --> 06:55.124
He has your cell phone.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.226
He just sent a message
from your cell phone.

06:59.378 --> 07:02.298
I'll TELL EVERYTHING ROOM
715, HOTEL BELLAVISTA

07:02.698 --> 07:03.716
It's a trap.

07:04.862 --> 07:05.862
Let's go.

07:33.029 --> 07:34.029
Adrian?

07:37.957 --> 07:39.834
I was unconscious
for a few minutes.

07:41.513 --> 07:42.674
And when I woke up...

07:43.509 --> 07:44.710
the nightmare began.

07:48.882 --> 07:50.413
What's the first
thing you remember?

07:51.488 --> 07:52.641
Banging on the door.

07:54.502 --> 07:55.502
Police!

07:57.909 --> 07:58.909
Are you alright?

08:24.023 --> 08:25.023
Police!

08:26.025 --> 08:27.025
Open the door.

08:37.660 --> 08:38.660
Out of the way.

08:39.770 --> 08:40.770
Laura!

08:45.776 --> 08:46.776
Do you hear me?

08:47.447 --> 08:48.447
Laura!

08:49.071 --> 08:51.782
We know you're in there!
Open the door!

08:52.433 --> 08:53.433
No, no.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.411
Laura! Help!

08:57.246 --> 08:58.521
Help, please!

08:59.067 --> 09:00.067
Police!

09:01.166 --> 09:02.251
Help!

09:04.295 --> 09:05.462
Get up!

09:06.261 --> 09:08.016
Hands up! Get up!

09:09.550 --> 09:11.036
There was someone in the room.

09:11.060 --> 09:12.594
Hands where I can see them.

09:12.894 --> 09:15.098
I didn't do anything.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.807
Hands up!

09:18.017 --> 09:19.727
- I didn't do anything.
- Get down!

09:19.992 --> 09:22.690
- There was someone else here.
- On the floor!

09:22.714 --> 09:24.090
Don't resist.

09:24.323 --> 09:25.658
Everybody out!

09:47.959 --> 09:50.132
The police report says that

09:50.466 --> 09:54.298
witnesses heard screams, but
didn't see anyone leave the room...

09:54.322 --> 09:56.115
So you didn't see
anyone leave the room.

09:56.627 --> 10:00.100
Which was locked from
inside by a chain.

10:01.402 --> 10:04.809
The report also said that no window
could be opened from the inside

10:04.833 --> 10:08.170
because in the cold months
the hotel removes the handles,

10:08.442 --> 10:10.611
and they hadn't been forced.

10:11.801 --> 10:15.342
They checked every way to
get out without being seen,

10:15.366 --> 10:17.741
but it was impossible
without leaving traces.

10:19.028 --> 10:20.858
And they didn't find any.

10:21.905 --> 10:23.438
So, according to your version,

10:23.697 --> 10:27.608
- your lover's murderer evaporated.
- That's right.

10:27.762 --> 10:30.515
- Before he got out, he had to get in.
- He was there when we arrived.

10:30.539 --> 10:32.674
But he had to get in somehow.

10:33.068 --> 10:34.409
And the hotel staff said

10:34.433 --> 10:37.065
only you had access to the key.

10:37.196 --> 10:40.240
The whole crime scene
was set up to frame me

10:40.354 --> 10:43.816
and give the police the false theory
that Laura fell in love with me

10:44.423 --> 10:45.627
and to protect my marriage

10:45.651 --> 10:47.987
I tried in vain to buy her off.
So I killed her.

10:50.820 --> 10:53.072
- But it's absurd, a trap...
- Whose trap?

10:53.320 --> 10:54.817
- I don't know.
- Why?

10:54.841 --> 10:56.244
I'm telling you I don't know!

10:56.577 --> 10:59.447
I just know my wife's left
me and taken my daughter.

10:59.471 --> 11:00.973
And someone's
getting away with it.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.080
Unless you pay attention

11:03.455 --> 11:06.617
and look for answers in the details
of your life, you know what?

11:06.641 --> 11:08.741
- What?
- You're saying the police are right.

11:08.929 --> 11:11.588
They say that
nobody had a motive

11:11.612 --> 11:13.245
to destroy you like this,

11:13.678 --> 11:17.227
so your version sounds like
make believe, Mr. Doria.

11:17.251 --> 11:19.339
It's not my job to
find the culprit. No.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.261
It's Felix's job and yours,
and the police, of course.

11:22.285 --> 11:24.120
They're meant to catch
the culprits, not me.

11:24.293 --> 11:26.314
You are their culprit.

11:29.565 --> 11:32.292
Mr. Doria, if you were me

11:32.987 --> 11:35.823
and I told you about this secret
plot, what would you think?

11:36.017 --> 11:38.577
I'm telling you what happened,
I don't know what else you expect.

11:39.609 --> 11:40.609
Do you know what?

11:43.578 --> 11:47.624
In my 30-year career I've
met two types of clients.

11:48.064 --> 11:50.379
Those who accept their
situation and cooperate,

11:50.645 --> 11:53.026
even if it means going
where they don't want to go,

11:53.140 --> 11:55.044
and those that think
they're smarter than I am

11:55.068 --> 11:58.157
and want me to get them
off without getting dirty.

11:59.014 --> 12:01.406
You're the second type.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.557
But let me be clear on this:

12:11.523 --> 12:14.234
There'll be no salvation
without suffering,

12:14.726 --> 12:16.401
and you're not
smarter than I am.

12:24.703 --> 12:27.664
YOUNG MAN DISAPPEARS IN BIERGE

12:29.833 --> 12:31.685
Have you wondered
what would happen

12:31.709 --> 12:33.522
if the state's
witness is involved?

12:38.091 --> 12:40.802
We've already wasted 10 minutes.

12:41.512 --> 12:43.424
I'll ask you this just once:

12:46.058 --> 12:49.186
Do you know who the
man in your room was?

12:49.353 --> 12:51.647
YOUNG MAN DISAPPEARS IN BIERGE

12:55.901 --> 12:57.402
If you want to find out,

12:57.708 --> 13:01.461
if you want me to get you out
of this without jail time,

13:02.533 --> 13:04.201
don't lie to me again.

13:20.159 --> 13:21.952
It all started three months ago.

13:31.084 --> 13:32.543
- Honey.
- How's Paris?

13:34.644 --> 13:38.003
- Full of nasty French people.
- Did the meeting go badly?

13:38.203 --> 13:40.547
- I don't think we'll get it.
- My dad called.

13:40.571 --> 13:43.377
He invited us sailing on Sunday.
I said we'd go.

13:43.492 --> 13:45.802
- He's dying to see Alex.
- Okay.

13:45.826 --> 13:49.545
It's Daddy. Say Daddy.
Say Daddy.

13:50.165 --> 13:52.374
Sonia, I have to
leave for the airport.

13:52.774 --> 13:55.290
Okay. Are you coming home
or staying in Barcelona?

14:00.623 --> 14:02.208
I'm coming home to you.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.211
Tell me when you've boarded.
I love you.

14:05.462 --> 14:06.462
I love you too.

14:15.011 --> 14:17.132
- Who was that?
- Sonia.

14:17.928 --> 14:18.928
What time is it?

14:19.323 --> 14:21.465
Almost six. We overslept.

14:39.820 --> 14:40.820
- Shall we go?
- Daddy.

15:20.191 --> 15:23.486
- We were doing fine.
- Sure, but this way is faster.

15:24.064 --> 15:25.315
You could drive faster, eh?

15:27.579 --> 15:29.598
- Shall I drive?
- You drive.

15:34.117 --> 15:35.117
What?

15:36.972 --> 15:38.100
I do nothing but lie.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.084
I think when you're
with me, you don't.

15:47.155 --> 15:49.282
The rest of the day I
lie because I'm with you.

15:50.867 --> 15:54.121
Being with me makes you happy.

15:55.997 --> 15:58.428
And I love the way I
feel when we're together.

16:00.971 --> 16:03.097
Remember what we said
when we started this?

16:03.923 --> 16:05.652
That we both wanted
the experience.

16:08.831 --> 16:10.343
We also said that
when the time came...

16:10.367 --> 16:12.275
Adrian, do you want
to leave Sonia?

16:12.463 --> 16:13.098
No.

16:13.455 --> 16:16.255
I don't want to leave Bruno either.
That's why what we have is perfect.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.752
But you can't have everything.

16:21.999 --> 16:23.493
You have to sacrifice something.

16:26.859 --> 16:27.983
We're doing fine.

16:29.987 --> 16:30.903
It's fine.

16:30.927 --> 16:33.276
No, what we're doing is
wrong, and you know it.

16:37.854 --> 16:38.854
That's it.

16:43.779 --> 16:44.779
I'm sorry.

17:02.497 --> 17:03.497
Are you alright?

17:05.680 --> 17:06.680
I think so.

17:39.313 --> 17:40.313
Hello?

17:54.495 --> 17:55.495
Are you alright?

18:14.185 --> 18:15.185
Shit!

18:22.414 --> 18:24.330
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.268
It's wasn't our fault,
it was the damn deer.

18:26.292 --> 18:27.371
I cut into his lane.

18:27.395 --> 18:29.165
He had no belt on
and he was texting!

18:29.276 --> 18:31.053
You made me drive too fast!

18:31.077 --> 18:34.579
You told me before,
there's always a sacrifice.

18:35.191 --> 18:36.867
- What are you saying?
- It's him or us.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.735
If you call the
police, we've had it.

18:40.056 --> 18:41.891
Listen to me, please.

18:43.154 --> 18:44.154
Nobody saw anything,

18:45.664 --> 18:46.664
nobody knows anything.

18:46.797 --> 18:49.180
Everything's still the same.
Your life, Sonia,

18:50.164 --> 18:51.164
your daughter,

18:52.310 --> 18:53.310
your career.

18:56.011 --> 18:57.477
You don't want to lose it all?

19:00.220 --> 19:01.220
Do you?

19:10.734 --> 19:11.734
Let's go.

19:28.042 --> 19:29.042
It won't start up.

19:30.429 --> 19:32.097
Come on, please start.

19:32.351 --> 19:35.687
Start! Start, for God's sake!
Let's go!

19:37.469 --> 19:39.262
- Shit.
- What is it?

19:39.420 --> 19:40.755
Someone's coming.

19:47.960 --> 19:48.960
Get out of the car.

19:58.307 --> 20:00.134
- What do we do?
- Leave it to me. Do what I do.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.158
Where are you going?

20:18.451 --> 20:19.493
He'll figure it out.

20:20.226 --> 20:21.914
What are you doing?

20:22.389 --> 20:23.916
We had an accident, okay?

20:24.444 --> 20:25.964
- We had an accident?
- Follow my lead.

20:31.935 --> 20:32.935
Hello.

20:35.467 --> 20:37.341
Need any help? What happened?

20:38.863 --> 20:42.904
I skidded and hit him, but
we're just trading details.

20:42.928 --> 20:44.698
Do you need an ambulance?

20:44.722 --> 20:47.629
No, really, we're fine. Thanks.

20:50.716 --> 20:51.716
Are you sure?

21:07.497 --> 21:10.041
It must be the insurance company.
I'll be right back.

21:15.458 --> 21:16.458
Hey.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.653
A good scare?

21:19.320 --> 21:22.083
A deer ran in front of
us and I'm still shaky.

21:27.333 --> 21:28.333
Hello?

21:28.850 --> 21:30.999
Hello. Yes, we called.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.246
- Are you sure?
- Thank you.

21:38.109 --> 21:39.694
How long will it be?

21:47.766 --> 21:49.535
Okay. Thanks. 'Bye.

21:52.876 --> 21:53.876
It's all sorted.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.369
I'm glad nobody got hurt.

21:56.917 --> 21:57.917
Thanks.

21:58.366 --> 21:59.786
- See you.
- See you.

22:03.956 --> 22:05.570
- What if he saw something?
- He didn't.

22:05.594 --> 22:07.302
He stopped, he
could've seen the kid.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.049
- We have to get rid of him.
- Are you crazy?

22:09.073 --> 22:10.445
There's a witness.

22:10.587 --> 22:12.547
If we leave him here,
he'll know we lied.

22:14.327 --> 22:15.327
Please.

22:29.808 --> 22:33.842
It's best if I stay
here and send for help.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.534
You take care of the body.

22:37.252 --> 22:38.252
What do I do with him?

22:39.606 --> 22:40.606
I don't know.

22:41.195 --> 22:44.114
But we have to get rid
of everything, okay?

22:45.949 --> 22:48.029
And then, if you want, we
can stop seeing each other.

22:50.902 --> 22:51.902
It's over.

23:14.031 --> 23:15.627
I drove for nearly an hour.

23:17.262 --> 23:18.597
And all I could think about

23:18.621 --> 23:20.700
was why I was there
instead of with my family.

23:24.362 --> 23:25.921
If I hadn't been with Laura,

23:26.739 --> 23:29.699
if we hadn't overslept, if
I hadn't taken the detour,

23:33.997 --> 23:36.200
that deer would never
have crossed my path.

23:37.865 --> 23:38.865
Ever.

23:43.979 --> 23:45.272
What did you do with the car?

23:49.520 --> 23:50.520
I buried it.

23:53.674 --> 23:54.687
The kid too?

26:22.292 --> 26:24.552
I kept hearing Laura's
words in my head.

26:29.047 --> 26:32.097
It was an accident. We couldn't
do anything for that kid.

26:33.713 --> 26:35.225
He had no future. We did.

26:36.304 --> 26:37.304
We did.

26:45.807 --> 26:47.644
He was like one
of those blotches,

26:50.166 --> 26:52.778
and I had to look at it like
that to keep from going insane.

26:57.867 --> 26:58.867
What then?

27:01.517 --> 27:04.533
I called Laura with a prepaid phone
card and told her where I was.

27:05.149 --> 27:07.853
We always used them
to talk to each other.

27:21.013 --> 27:22.013
It was horrible.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.309
What happened?

27:25.959 --> 27:27.251
Hello, my car broke down.

27:27.603 --> 27:30.188
No, I'm fine, but
I need a tow truck.

27:30.813 --> 27:31.813
Yes.

27:32.341 --> 27:33.341
Where am I?

28:26.241 --> 28:27.951
- Hello.
- Hello. Everything alright?

28:28.398 --> 28:30.734
Yes, a deer ran in front of
me, but I'm fine, thanks.

28:31.511 --> 28:33.263
You're lucky. You could've died.

28:34.032 --> 28:37.235
It won't start. The
engine won't start.

28:37.259 --> 28:40.489
I called road assistance
but they're overrun.

28:40.513 --> 28:41.722
Everything has a solution.

28:42.263 --> 28:44.502
I know these cars in and
out, they're good machines.

28:44.855 --> 28:45.967
What a coincidence.

28:46.434 --> 28:48.610
I was an engineer at their
Spanish factory years ago.

28:48.841 --> 28:50.677
Tomas Garrido. I've
got a garage now.

28:52.005 --> 28:53.005
Nice to meet you.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.311
- I need to get to Barcelona.
- Got a flash light?

29:02.471 --> 29:06.036
It's my sister's car. She lent
it to me and I don't know...

29:07.753 --> 29:10.530
Don't worry. I'll get mine.

29:24.717 --> 29:26.677
It's the starter system.

29:29.259 --> 29:32.392
The engine sensor's
probably stuck on 'stop'.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.953
If the impact didn't
damage anything else,

29:35.347 --> 29:37.891
you just reconnect the
control module and reset it.

29:39.366 --> 29:40.940
The rest looks alright.

29:41.597 --> 29:44.760
If you want, I can
tow it to my house

29:44.784 --> 29:45.784
and fix it there.

29:48.735 --> 29:50.599
If you prefer, I'll
call a tow truck

29:50.623 --> 29:52.759
and tell them where to find you.

29:52.957 --> 29:54.816
- How long would it take?
- The tow truck?

29:55.038 --> 29:56.557
No, for you to fix it.

29:58.103 --> 29:59.303
A couple of hours, tops.

30:00.212 --> 30:01.212
Alright.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.687
So you live in Barcelona.

30:10.682 --> 30:11.803
What brings you here?

30:12.593 --> 30:14.012
My sister lives in Barbastro.

30:15.856 --> 30:19.517
My wife worked near there,
in the nature reserve.

30:19.959 --> 30:21.655
Now she works near
Bierge, in the valley,

30:22.072 --> 30:23.507
20 minutes from home.

30:26.701 --> 30:29.008
She used to teach literature,
but she had to give it up.

30:29.996 --> 30:30.996
Cancer.

30:32.845 --> 30:35.754
That's why we moved here,
for a more peaceful life.

30:37.171 --> 30:38.301
What do you do?

30:47.353 --> 30:48.512
I've got a book store.

30:50.021 --> 30:51.091
I love reading.

30:52.946 --> 30:53.946
Especially plays.

30:54.554 --> 30:56.389
The classics are my weakness.

30:56.832 --> 30:58.213
My wife introduced me to them.

30:58.826 --> 31:01.336
That was how we met,
in a theatre group.

31:02.347 --> 31:04.382
She was very good, but I...

31:05.359 --> 31:06.819
I just joined to meet women.

31:10.455 --> 31:11.880
You haven't told me your name.

31:13.956 --> 31:15.833
- Raquel.
- Raquel.

31:18.169 --> 31:19.920
Raquel, your phone's ringing.

31:22.293 --> 31:23.293
You're right.

31:28.704 --> 31:30.328
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, Laura.

31:30.646 --> 31:33.059
How was the shoot?
When's your flight?

31:33.288 --> 31:35.719
I was about to call you.
I'm going to be late.

31:35.743 --> 31:36.455
Don't worry.

31:36.479 --> 31:39.565
I was about to take some work home.
You can't concentrate here.

31:39.838 --> 31:41.047
Too many interruptions.

31:41.297 --> 31:43.256
How come you're late?

31:43.280 --> 31:46.816
Nothing, a setback.
Engine trouble.

31:46.840 --> 31:49.218
Relax, just tell me
when you're taking off.

31:49.492 --> 31:50.785
No, you don't need to get me.

31:50.951 --> 31:54.450
I'll get some dinner here and
work till it's time to get you.

31:54.474 --> 31:57.823
- Don't come, please, Bruno.
- Laura, are you alright?

31:57.847 --> 31:59.085
Sorry, sorry, no,

31:59.251 --> 32:01.052
I'm fine, I really am.

32:01.401 --> 32:02.861
Sorry I didn't call you before.

32:02.961 --> 32:05.346
Okay, don't worry.
See you at home.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.426
- I love you.
- I love you too.

32:17.687 --> 32:18.687
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

32:19.990 --> 32:21.241
Elvira, my wife.

32:21.482 --> 32:23.502
This is Raquel,
she ran into a deer

32:23.526 --> 32:25.736
and it blocked the car's starter.
I'm going to fix it.

32:25.963 --> 32:27.631
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

32:28.066 --> 32:30.527
Are you hurt? You have
blood on your hand.

32:33.313 --> 32:34.964
- It must be from the deer.
- The deer?

32:35.073 --> 32:38.002
- Let me see. A cut could get infected.
- I'm not hurt.

32:39.856 --> 32:41.728
Sorry, I'm in a big hurry.

32:41.752 --> 32:44.213
Then we'll cut the chatter.
I'll get to work.

32:44.380 --> 32:46.257
- Like a coffee?
- Yes, please.

32:46.716 --> 32:49.051
- Come in.
- No, I can wait here.

32:49.191 --> 32:51.340
Wait here in this cold?
Come in, woman.

32:51.364 --> 32:52.782
You can clean that up.

32:53.517 --> 32:54.517
Come on.

33:18.638 --> 33:19.638
Everything alright?

33:20.188 --> 33:21.727
Yes, thanks, everything's fine.

33:21.751 --> 33:23.591
I'll take Tomas some
coffee and be right back.

33:24.394 --> 33:25.471
Okay, thanks.

34:24.188 --> 34:27.065
We had a couple of scares
too when we came here.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.223
You don't want anything to eat?

34:29.706 --> 34:30.706
No. Thanks.

34:32.313 --> 34:35.525
It's a good place to live,
but you have to adapt.

34:37.277 --> 34:38.277
Children?

34:40.152 --> 34:42.103
Do you have any children?
I see that...

34:42.304 --> 34:43.601
Oh, no, no.

34:44.438 --> 34:45.643
My husband wants to, but I...

34:45.668 --> 34:49.420
Well, I do too, but I work
a lot, I don't know...

34:49.813 --> 34:51.524
Don't let it get to you.

34:51.841 --> 34:55.206
I had Dani, I mean Daniel,
he doesn't like Dani,

34:55.427 --> 34:58.011
when I was nearly 40.
A child changes your life.

35:00.615 --> 35:02.575
But they give it all back too.
Excuse me.

35:05.629 --> 35:08.126
So handsome. He'll be home soon.
Maybe you know him.

35:11.221 --> 35:13.153
Clara? Hello.

35:14.561 --> 35:16.683
No, I'm waiting for him.
He went out with the boys.

35:18.815 --> 35:19.815
What?

35:21.412 --> 35:22.621
You're with the boys?

35:24.999 --> 35:26.147
And Daniel's not there?

35:28.460 --> 35:31.349
That's strange,
he left here at 6.

35:35.686 --> 35:36.686
Yes.

35:37.259 --> 35:39.529
Yes, he got back from
work, changed, and ran out.

35:44.356 --> 35:47.732
Right. You're all set.
I went over it and it's fine.

35:47.861 --> 35:49.012
Are you staying for dinner?

35:49.828 --> 35:51.591
I'm sure my wife convinced you.

35:52.151 --> 35:53.169
Okay.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.494
I'll get my coat, I'm really late.
Sorry.

35:55.801 --> 35:58.722
Yes, okay, Clara, I'll
call you right back.

36:01.994 --> 36:06.107
Clara says the boys haven't seen
Daniel, they thought he was with her.

36:07.917 --> 36:08.964
What do you mean?

36:09.391 --> 36:11.582
He should be with his friends.

36:11.606 --> 36:14.275
But nobody knows anything.
Did he say anything to you?

36:15.315 --> 36:18.402
Okay, don't get nervous.
Maybe he had other plans.

36:18.636 --> 36:21.305
Nervous no, Tomas, he told
be he'd be with friends.

36:21.705 --> 36:23.216
Maybe he didn't
tell you the truth.

36:23.825 --> 36:24.825
Why?

36:25.809 --> 36:27.306
What if he met another girl?

36:28.562 --> 36:31.106
No, Tomas, no. This
is all very strange.

36:31.732 --> 36:33.025
I'm going to call him.

36:37.877 --> 36:40.046
Leave him be. He's a big boy.

36:47.915 --> 36:50.115
- Do you hear that?
- Yes.

36:59.697 --> 37:00.975
Did you hear a cell phone?

37:03.263 --> 37:04.765
I'm calling him again.

37:06.642 --> 37:10.604
My son's not with his friends
and my wife's imagining things.

37:29.990 --> 37:30.990
Here it is.

37:32.793 --> 37:33.793
That's strange.

37:34.575 --> 37:36.335
Daniel never goes out
without his cell phone.

37:36.897 --> 37:38.639
He must've dropped it.

37:39.307 --> 37:40.432
You tell her, Raquel.

37:41.510 --> 37:43.554
I have to go. I'm really late.

38:06.267 --> 38:07.767
No one's heard from Daniel.

38:25.377 --> 38:26.377
What do we do?

38:29.516 --> 38:31.002
Tell me what we should do.

38:34.605 --> 38:35.699
I thought of something.

38:40.015 --> 38:41.205
But I'm in your hands.

38:47.052 --> 38:48.052
It depends on you.

38:53.442 --> 38:54.842
The look in her eyes scared me.

38:57.388 --> 39:00.349
I got rid of my car,
without a trace.

39:15.451 --> 39:19.978
I don't know, it's in
front of a scrapyard.

39:27.407 --> 39:28.653
Then I said goodbye,

39:28.677 --> 39:31.180
agreeing that it was the last
time we'd see each other.

39:39.737 --> 39:41.856
I reported my car stolen,

39:41.880 --> 39:44.091
pretending I just
got back from Paris.

39:46.622 --> 39:47.962
I told Sonia the same thing:

39:48.465 --> 39:51.979
I'd stayed overnight
in our city place.

39:52.003 --> 39:53.058
But are you alright?

39:53.178 --> 39:54.502
I spent a sleepless night.

39:55.561 --> 39:58.159
I felt like a
fraud, an impostor.

39:59.184 --> 40:02.396
It had taken me ten
years to reach the top,

40:03.615 --> 40:06.951
but I could lose it all
in the blink of an eye.

40:09.427 --> 40:11.013
The next day, I went to work.

40:12.565 --> 40:15.943
We were preparing the entry of
Global Go Tech Media into Asia

40:16.081 --> 40:18.109
and it would've been
strange if I wasn't there.

40:20.127 --> 40:22.637
I'd been trying to close
the deal for a year,

40:23.600 --> 40:26.203
and now it was about to
happen I couldn't screw it up.

40:33.287 --> 40:35.979
Before going home, I tried
to gather my thoughts

40:36.003 --> 40:37.957
in order to face my
wife and daughter.

40:41.440 --> 40:42.895
I needed to put on a mask

40:42.919 --> 40:45.513
to hide the man I wasn't
but would be again.

40:52.082 --> 40:54.084
And when I thought
I'd done it...

40:55.124 --> 40:56.114
the inevitable happened.

40:56.138 --> 40:57.803
Daniel Garrido, 23,

40:57.827 --> 41:02.292
left work in this
bank around 6 p.m.

41:02.773 --> 41:06.737
He went home and minutes
later went out again.

41:07.227 --> 41:08.931
His parents expected
him for dinner,

41:08.955 --> 41:10.570
but they've heard
nothing from him.

41:10.783 --> 41:13.119
Family and friends have
united to search for him,

41:13.285 --> 41:15.454
believing he had a car crash

41:15.655 --> 41:19.375
and perhaps his car is hidden
down a ravine in the area.

41:20.913 --> 41:23.624
The father's face
engraved on my retina.

41:24.649 --> 41:25.916
I saw myself in his pain.

41:30.386 --> 41:33.376
I swore it'd be the last mistake
I'd ever make in my life.

41:37.115 --> 41:38.364
- Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

41:42.940 --> 41:43.940
Hello.

41:47.563 --> 41:48.563
Are you sure?

41:52.535 --> 41:53.897
Tell me if there's any news.

42:00.724 --> 42:02.973
The state's witness
is in the courthouse.

42:03.850 --> 42:06.659
His identity is unknown,
but the judge is on his way.

42:10.345 --> 42:11.565
I have to talk to Felix.

42:15.492 --> 42:16.932
- What is it?
- Felix, where are you?

42:17.369 --> 42:19.378
Bilbao airport,
getting off the plane.

42:19.402 --> 42:20.790
Virginia Goodman's here because

42:20.814 --> 42:22.359
the prosecutor may
be ahead of us.

42:22.383 --> 42:24.636
- The prosecutor...?
- When will you be back?

42:24.815 --> 42:26.608
Tonight on the last flight.
Put her on.

42:27.956 --> 42:28.956
He wants to talk to you.

42:32.728 --> 42:34.230
- Felix.
- What's going on?

42:34.659 --> 42:36.030
A last-minute witness.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.469
- He just got to the courthouse.
- Virginia?

42:38.493 --> 42:41.413
Mr. Doria will probably
have to testify tonight.

42:41.773 --> 42:44.418
Send me the details in writing,
but I leave him in your hands.

42:44.442 --> 42:47.065
I'm going after something big.
It may be crucial to the case.

42:47.232 --> 42:49.484
- I'll call back in a couple of hours.
- Alright.

42:49.704 --> 42:50.772
Thanks, Felix.

43:03.301 --> 43:04.301
What did he say?

43:08.754 --> 43:10.922
It's all under
control, don't worry.

43:11.495 --> 43:14.039
Good. Let's continue.
Where were we?

43:15.838 --> 43:16.840
I focused on my life.

43:20.474 --> 43:21.794
But the police came around.

43:22.392 --> 43:24.002
Mr. Doria, you have visitors.

43:24.936 --> 43:25.942
It's the police.

43:27.680 --> 43:29.224
That's not on any file.

43:29.497 --> 43:30.506
How do you know?

43:31.541 --> 43:33.627
The details, Mr. Doria.

43:44.944 --> 43:48.811
The Bierge police found
debris from two collisions

43:48.835 --> 43:52.381
five miles from where
the missing man lived.

43:52.686 --> 43:56.232
But there's no record of
either of the accidents.

43:57.260 --> 43:59.506
Strangely, the
kid's father picked

43:59.648 --> 44:01.945
up a woman who'd
had an accident,

44:01.969 --> 44:05.414
right there, the same
day his son disappeared.

44:14.425 --> 44:15.425
Do you know her?

44:29.954 --> 44:30.789
What is this?

44:30.813 --> 44:34.817
Look, why would my client care
about what happened in Bierge

44:34.989 --> 44:36.402
when he was in Paris?

44:36.426 --> 44:40.706
She told the missing kid's
father that she'd hit a deer.

44:41.410 --> 44:44.622
But debris from a second
vehicle on that road

44:44.788 --> 44:47.703
leads us to the theory
that something happened

44:47.727 --> 44:50.188
and she covered it up
with someone's help.

44:50.548 --> 44:51.559
And?

44:51.583 --> 44:54.391
The license plate of the
vehicle this woman was driving

44:54.568 --> 44:58.086
belongs to a BMW in
your client's name.

44:58.110 --> 45:01.000
It was stolen from a private
car park that weekend.

45:01.600 --> 45:04.053
Are you insinuating
the Mr. Doria is lying

45:04.077 --> 45:06.447
to hide an accident about
which you have no proof?

45:06.716 --> 45:07.932
According to the report,

45:07.956 --> 45:12.019
you couldn't produce the parking
card to prove the car was there.

45:12.043 --> 45:14.208
I lost it. I usually
keep it in my wallet,

45:14.232 --> 45:16.980
but I must've left it in my jacket
and it fell out on the trip.

45:17.004 --> 45:20.253
I know, it's in your statement.
Very convenient.

45:20.277 --> 45:24.224
Hold on, did the license plate info
come from the missing kid's father?

45:26.516 --> 45:30.103
Now that is convenient,
and uncorroborated.

45:30.376 --> 45:32.868
That's what we're trying
to do: corroborate it.

45:32.892 --> 45:36.555
You needn't have bothered my client
to corroborate his Paris trip,

45:36.931 --> 45:39.767
you just had to ask his
secretary for the details.

45:40.820 --> 45:41.904
Are we done?

45:48.163 --> 45:49.372
Why are you so nervous?

45:53.628 --> 45:55.226
Tell me or I won't
be able to help you.

45:56.404 --> 45:58.759
Do you have anything to do
with this kid's disappearance?

46:00.429 --> 46:01.429
Well then?

46:07.334 --> 46:08.334
I wasn't in Paris.

46:11.814 --> 46:12.814
I was with a woman.

46:14.856 --> 46:18.153
So Eva can't prove to the
police that you were in Paris?

46:19.611 --> 46:22.859
Can you make them believe I was?
Can you buy me an alibi?

46:22.883 --> 46:24.963
- Do I have a choice?
- I ended it, it was a mistake.

46:26.867 --> 46:29.170
I can't let this
damn coincidence

46:29.194 --> 46:30.991
ruin my life with Alex and Sonia.
I can't.

46:32.679 --> 46:36.357
Next time you call me, start
by telling me everything.

46:41.471 --> 46:42.557
I need something else.

46:46.287 --> 46:47.287
What?

46:48.265 --> 46:50.466
The police file. I don't
want this to haunt me.

46:53.228 --> 46:54.248
I'll take care of it.

46:55.438 --> 46:57.119
Later, my Paris
alibi was checked out

46:57.143 --> 46:59.020
and the police
dropped the matter.

46:59.139 --> 47:02.769
Felix fulfilled the first part
of the deal, but not the second.

47:03.467 --> 47:07.426
One of my sources found your
name in the police files,

47:07.742 --> 47:10.023
and I'm afraid that the
prosecutor may have done the same.

47:15.875 --> 47:18.003
I'd never have gone so far
if it weren't for Laura.

47:18.353 --> 47:21.881
What did she do when you told her
the police asked you to ID her?

47:22.048 --> 47:23.049
I didn't tell her.

47:25.260 --> 47:26.689
I know you contacted her.

47:27.291 --> 47:31.420
The rich want to stay rich, protect
themselves and their property.

47:31.808 --> 47:36.563
Wherever there are rich people,
there are surveillance cameras.

47:36.730 --> 47:40.366
How'd you get the police to think
Daniel Garrido was on the run?

47:40.390 --> 47:43.268
- Where are you calling from?
- A phone booth.

47:43.634 --> 47:46.885
Talking in a place with so much
surveillance isn't very smart.

47:46.909 --> 47:48.911
My nerves gave me away, I know.

47:51.119 --> 47:53.784
But don't think I'm stupid
enough to contact Laura

47:53.808 --> 47:56.330
right after the police
tried to link me to her.

47:57.042 --> 47:58.627
When and why then?

48:01.633 --> 48:03.205
When I saw how far she could go.

48:06.551 --> 48:09.095
Laura never stopped when
she knew what she wanted.

48:10.347 --> 48:12.161
- Hello.
- Say hi to Grandpa.

48:12.185 --> 48:14.076
She did it with me when we met.

48:14.100 --> 48:15.100
Can I pay up?

48:16.227 --> 48:18.980
And she was doing it again
to put it all behind her.

48:19.180 --> 48:20.188
There you go.

48:20.212 --> 48:23.477
The police have ruled
out that Daniel Garrido,

48:23.501 --> 48:27.776
the young man from Bierge missing
for 3 weeks, had an accident.

48:27.800 --> 48:29.510
The latest investigations say

48:29.869 --> 48:34.313
he could've faked his own
disappearance in order to run away.

48:34.647 --> 48:36.763
Police sources state

48:36.959 --> 48:42.174
that he took 50,000 euros from
the bank branch where he worked.

48:42.198 --> 48:46.234
Daniel Garrido redirected
small amounts...

48:46.258 --> 48:47.802
All ready to set sail.

48:49.586 --> 48:52.555
I just got a call. An
emergency meeting with Mr. Lee.

48:52.764 --> 48:54.766
- Where are you calling from?
- A booth.

48:57.640 --> 49:00.258
See you in four hours in the
bar in front of the scrapyard.

49:12.576 --> 49:13.576
What's this?

49:15.348 --> 49:16.474
The kid's wallet.

49:18.773 --> 49:20.650
I got it before putting
the kid in the trunk.

49:23.917 --> 49:25.957
I thought it might be useful
to us, and it has been.

49:28.700 --> 49:31.155
After the accident, Bruno
worked at home for a few days.

49:33.167 --> 49:36.649
I used one of those mornings to
end this the only possible way.

50:40.497 --> 50:41.719
What are you telling me?

50:42.248 --> 50:46.254
Your lover was a computer banking
expert as well as a photographer?

50:46.795 --> 50:48.898
Do you want the jury to think
you're taking them for idiots?

50:48.922 --> 50:50.956
Laura met her husband while
she was working in that bank.

50:50.980 --> 50:55.197
Technology makes giant leaps,
you know that better than anyone.

50:55.428 --> 50:58.157
Did your love keep up to date
while she was a photographer?

50:58.181 --> 50:59.641
Maybe her husband helped her.

51:00.375 --> 51:03.461
Maybe she told him the truth
but wanted to keep me out of it.

51:04.646 --> 51:05.935
You didn't know Laura.

51:07.273 --> 51:08.895
She can highly seductive.

51:08.919 --> 51:11.171
The perfect femme
fatale prototype.

51:12.036 --> 51:13.620
Do you realize what you've done?

51:15.160 --> 51:16.160
What do you think?

51:18.037 --> 51:21.457
Don't worry, if I'd left any trace,
we wouldn't be here right now.

51:24.133 --> 51:25.133
What?

51:25.917 --> 51:27.836
Don't look at me like that.

51:28.628 --> 51:30.898
You didn't call the police because
we were doing the right thing.

51:30.922 --> 51:32.339
No, we weren't.

51:33.761 --> 51:34.761
Adrian,

51:35.969 --> 51:39.092
if I go down, you're
going down with me.

51:39.116 --> 51:40.378
The police came to see me.

51:42.085 --> 51:43.251
Don't threaten me.

51:45.069 --> 51:47.677
Don't you threaten me.

51:49.566 --> 51:51.693
I have photos that show
that you weren't in Paris.

52:34.503 --> 52:37.256
The following days
weren't exactly relaxed.

52:38.073 --> 52:40.300
My company entered
the Asian market

52:40.324 --> 52:42.603
with the world's
top technology firm.

52:43.494 --> 52:46.078
I was given the Businessman
of the Year award.

52:47.455 --> 52:49.541
I entered a media blitz.

52:55.171 --> 52:57.131
Mr. Doria, how do you feel?

52:58.635 --> 52:59.923
Very happy.

52:59.947 --> 53:01.936
I was sold as the
man of the hour.

53:03.164 --> 53:06.668
A model for young people like me,
winners who came from nothing.

53:07.894 --> 53:09.219
But it was all a sham.

53:10.224 --> 53:13.382
I'd felt rotten on the
inside for some time.

53:21.336 --> 53:22.754
Because I taught her.

53:22.913 --> 53:24.557
- To do what?
- To say 'Papa'.

53:24.581 --> 53:26.045
She's with her parents now...

53:26.069 --> 53:29.016
Mr. Doria, excuse me. A reporter
insists on speaking to you.

53:29.040 --> 53:31.579
- He says he knows you.
- Yes.

53:31.603 --> 53:34.571
- Please.
- If you'll excuse me.

53:34.957 --> 53:37.026
Be careful with that.

53:38.169 --> 53:39.169
See you soon.

53:44.021 --> 53:45.594
On the right, please. Thank you.

54:01.909 --> 54:05.422
Mr. Doria? Sorry to bother
you on such a special day.

54:09.340 --> 54:10.382
Do you know who I am?

54:13.501 --> 54:15.628
Just that you're not Ivan Souto.

54:23.845 --> 54:24.845
Please.

54:26.264 --> 54:27.969
I'm Daniel Garrido's father.

54:27.993 --> 54:30.523
I don't know if you've
seen the news, but...

54:31.582 --> 54:35.030
they say he ran away and
I have some questions,

54:35.480 --> 54:36.480
if it's alright with you.

54:38.458 --> 54:42.287
I only know what I read
in the paper, I'm sorry.

54:42.311 --> 54:46.945
My son is no thief and
he's not on the run.

54:47.744 --> 54:48.965
My son is dead.

54:49.797 --> 54:51.874
Someone is laughing
at my wife and at me.

54:54.308 --> 54:57.338
The day the police spoke to
you, Elvira and I were there.

55:01.440 --> 55:02.493
I know what I saw.

55:03.051 --> 55:04.750
Our son used his cell phone

55:04.904 --> 55:08.157
shortly before Tomas picked
up that woman on the road,

55:09.024 --> 55:12.062
so it's impossible that
the phone was at home,

55:12.086 --> 55:14.637
unless she brought it.

55:14.661 --> 55:16.228
And that could only happen

55:16.252 --> 55:18.819
if she ran into my
son at some point.

55:19.650 --> 55:22.236
And she wasn't alone,
someone was with her.

55:22.509 --> 55:24.059
How can you be so sure?

55:24.083 --> 55:25.306
I've already told you.

55:26.225 --> 55:28.932
She adjusted the driver's seat.

55:30.420 --> 55:31.420
She wasn't driving.

55:32.225 --> 55:33.225
She lied to me!

55:33.360 --> 55:35.119
It's my sister's car.

55:35.143 --> 55:36.798
She lent it to me
and I don't know...

55:36.951 --> 55:39.884
She lied and nobody
lies for no reason.

55:41.714 --> 55:43.134
She lied to protect herself,

55:44.374 --> 55:45.882
or to protect you.

55:46.842 --> 55:47.842
Got a light?

55:49.408 --> 55:50.860
That woman was hiding something.

56:04.695 --> 56:05.696
And so are you.

56:08.574 --> 56:09.774
I don't know anything, really.

56:11.327 --> 56:12.894
I was in Paris at the time.

56:14.166 --> 56:15.667
That's what the police said.

56:16.438 --> 56:19.191
But some plane tickets
and a hotel reservation

56:19.692 --> 56:20.739
don't prove anything.

56:21.772 --> 56:25.860
Still, we trusted the
police and went home.

56:31.374 --> 56:32.865
Until a few days later

56:32.889 --> 56:35.768
when the news accused my
son of being a thief...

56:42.846 --> 56:46.182
and we knew it was a
set-up, it wasn't Daniel.

56:46.765 --> 56:48.642
He was never bad to anyone.

56:51.586 --> 56:55.554
My wife was devastated when
she saw what that meant.

56:59.062 --> 57:00.708
But I wasn't giving up.

57:03.524 --> 57:05.466
And I followed the
only lead left.

57:07.503 --> 57:08.503
You.

57:10.776 --> 57:13.553
And I saw that you could
lose it all over a setback.

57:16.687 --> 57:20.706
What it would mean if you
admitted you weren't in Paris

57:20.730 --> 57:22.263
but with another woman.

57:24.766 --> 57:27.810
I went back to the police but
they still didn't believe me.

57:29.439 --> 57:31.409
There I realized how
powerful you are.

57:33.284 --> 57:35.652
Power makes the wolf
bigger than he is.

57:36.377 --> 57:38.486
But I'm not scared
of wolves like you.

57:40.602 --> 57:42.109
When you have the
most terrifying

57:42.133 --> 57:43.688
experience a parent
can go through,

57:44.295 --> 57:45.575
having your child
taken from you,

57:45.722 --> 57:47.683
vanishing without anyone caring,

57:48.933 --> 57:50.543
fear doesn't exist anymore.

57:51.798 --> 57:53.056
Nothing exists anymore.

57:55.928 --> 57:58.430
They'll soon discover
that I'm an intruder,

58:00.061 --> 58:01.493
so tell me the truth:

58:03.251 --> 58:04.251
Where is my son?

58:07.404 --> 58:08.903
I assure you, you're mistaken.

58:09.176 --> 58:12.323
You were in that car, with
that woman not called Raquel.

58:12.553 --> 58:15.348
You had an accident in the
place where I found her,

58:15.675 --> 58:17.398
and my son's car was there.

58:18.419 --> 58:20.037
Did you get rid of him?

58:22.467 --> 58:23.467
Was it that easy?

58:41.116 --> 58:42.147
Mr. Doria,

58:43.041 --> 58:44.374
was that what happened?

58:45.522 --> 58:46.627
From one father to another.

58:48.958 --> 58:51.485
My wife and I know
our son is dead.

58:52.154 --> 58:54.902
We just want to find him, bury
him and let him rest in peace.

58:54.926 --> 58:56.677
- Sir, you have to come with us.
- Don't touch me.

58:56.701 --> 58:58.286
- Please.
- Don't touch me!

58:58.758 --> 59:00.298
Please, Mr. Doria,
I'm begging you.

59:00.322 --> 59:02.011
Don't touch me! Please!

59:02.367 --> 59:04.911
If your girl had disappeared,

59:05.050 --> 59:08.546
you'd want the culprit to know
he wouldn't get away with it.

59:08.773 --> 59:10.066
Son of a bitch!

59:13.868 --> 59:15.041
Do you know him?

59:15.994 --> 59:17.066
Do you know him?

59:23.870 --> 59:24.870
Let's go inside.

59:33.393 --> 59:34.393
Address?

59:34.754 --> 59:38.225
5 San Ramon St., Bierge.

59:39.465 --> 59:41.078
No one linked him to me.

59:41.477 --> 59:42.311
Telephone?

59:42.445 --> 59:43.556
Nor did he.

59:45.647 --> 59:47.657
He knew it'd just
complicate things.

59:49.381 --> 59:52.478
And Felix had cleared my
name from his son's case.

59:52.502 --> 59:54.008
- What town was that?
- Bierge.

01:00:06.622 --> 01:00:09.920
He went home with just enough
strength to look after his wife.

01:00:17.195 --> 01:00:18.557
After that, he vanished.

01:00:20.874 --> 01:00:22.034
I never heard from him again.

01:00:26.327 --> 01:00:27.327
Fine.

01:00:28.586 --> 01:00:31.226
Now we have all the
cards on the table.

01:00:32.109 --> 01:00:34.218
Two dead people and two bodies.

01:00:34.882 --> 01:00:36.303
Your lover's murder

01:00:36.327 --> 01:00:39.610
seems to be a direct result of
the death of Daniel Garrido.

01:00:41.341 --> 01:00:43.928
But for the police
there's only one murder

01:00:43.952 --> 01:00:46.981
because they only have
one body, Laura Vidal's.

01:00:47.481 --> 01:00:49.302
And the suspect is you.

01:00:50.026 --> 01:00:53.526
But for us and for
Daniel Garrido's parents,

01:00:54.149 --> 01:00:56.202
there's another body
and another death:

01:00:56.475 --> 01:00:58.243
the missing kid.

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:02.564
And the Garridos suspect that you
and your lover are the culprits.

01:01:03.655 --> 01:01:06.645
She's dead, so
all that's left...

01:01:08.224 --> 01:01:09.224
is you.

01:01:11.378 --> 01:01:12.821
What does this puzzle
suggest to you?

01:01:15.432 --> 01:01:16.775
What does it suggest to you?

01:01:16.799 --> 01:01:20.189
It makes me think of the
mystery in the hotel room,

01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:24.177
of the man you say
killed your lover

01:01:24.201 --> 01:01:27.580
and then vanished,
as if by magic.

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:30.242
Someone linked to
Daniel Garrido.

01:01:33.116 --> 01:01:35.619
There's someone unnamed who
knows more than the parents.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.481
Need any help?

01:01:39.664 --> 01:01:41.169
Do you want the jury to believe

01:01:41.193 --> 01:01:43.219
that this driver lured
you to that hotel?

01:01:43.351 --> 01:01:44.473
To what end?

01:01:44.497 --> 01:01:48.001
To blackmail us with what he
knew: that we were guilty.

01:01:49.185 --> 01:01:51.505
Why he didn't know who I was
and that Laura wasn't my wife.

01:01:51.648 --> 01:01:53.307
Details, Mr. Doria.

01:01:53.525 --> 01:01:56.773
A jury will only believe
your twisted theory

01:01:56.797 --> 01:01:58.619
if the details are plausible.

01:01:58.786 --> 01:02:01.753
I haven't told you how he lured
us to the Hotel Bellavista.

01:02:05.003 --> 01:02:06.138
This came for you.

01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:13.654
SENDER: DANIEL GARRIDO

01:02:23.282 --> 01:02:25.659
I know what you and
you little friend did.

01:02:26.334 --> 01:02:29.212
The price for my silence
is 100,000 euros.

01:02:29.666 --> 01:02:31.889
In small, unmarked bills.

01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:35.858
Unless I get them today,
I'll send this photo

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.779
to the police so that
they find Daniel Garrido.

01:02:45.846 --> 01:02:47.181
At 5 o'clock sharp

01:02:47.723 --> 01:02:51.018
both of you are to go to
the Bierge train station.

01:02:52.844 --> 01:02:54.369
Be punctual.

01:02:54.772 --> 01:02:56.936
I'll call the phone
booth in the car park

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.481
and tell you where to
hand over the money.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:02.238
Don't come alone,
without the money,

01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:04.182
or try anything,

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:05.885
or I'll call the police.

01:03:07.678 --> 01:03:10.180
The package was sent from
Bierge three days ago.

01:03:11.896 --> 01:03:13.822
The sender signed
it: Daniel Garrido.

01:03:16.643 --> 01:03:18.963
- Was this where...?
- If it isn't, it looks a lot like it.

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:23.583
Mr. Doria.

01:03:24.041 --> 01:03:25.416
Did you notice the moon?

01:03:29.729 --> 01:03:31.939
There's a huge
full moon tonight.

01:03:34.255 --> 01:03:37.155
As big as the hole
in your story.

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:38.982
How do you know unless
you let me finish?

01:03:39.006 --> 01:03:41.164
How did that driver
know about the swamp?

01:03:41.188 --> 01:03:43.190
The noise I heard
before the car sank.

01:03:45.542 --> 01:03:47.020
What if it wasn't just the deer?

01:03:49.243 --> 01:03:51.973
What if Laura hadn't
convinced him we'd crashed?

01:03:52.155 --> 01:03:53.817
I'm glad it was nothing.

01:03:54.475 --> 01:03:55.475
Thanks.

01:03:57.084 --> 01:03:59.206
Maybe he saw something or
suspected our attitude,

01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:01.399
then pretended to
leave in order to hide.

01:04:02.111 --> 01:04:04.484
Sure. I understand your problem.

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:06.298
You're trying to lead your story

01:04:06.322 --> 01:04:08.238
away from Daniel
Garrido's death.

01:04:08.451 --> 01:04:10.773
- Excuse me?
- The driver was motivated by money.

01:04:10.797 --> 01:04:13.920
If you focus on the
blackmailing driver

01:04:13.944 --> 01:04:17.363
and people ignore the poor
kid, you'll look less guilty.

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:18.806
Have you got a better idea?

01:04:20.013 --> 01:04:21.543
I'm going to ask
you three questions.

01:04:21.567 --> 01:04:23.402
If you answer just one,

01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:25.904
we'll go on with your
far-fetched story.

01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:30.974
One: Why the incriminating
message on your cell phone?

01:04:31.398 --> 01:04:34.858
Two: Why didn't the killer take
the money if that was his main aim?

01:04:34.882 --> 01:04:38.881
And three: How did he get
in and out of the room

01:04:38.905 --> 01:04:40.369
like a ghost?

01:04:43.278 --> 01:04:44.278
Do you see?

01:04:44.571 --> 01:04:47.073
You're giving the prosecutor
just what he wants:

01:04:47.214 --> 01:04:50.507
unconnected crap that
will shatter the illusion

01:04:50.531 --> 01:04:52.699
that you have a solid
story without cracks.

01:04:52.723 --> 01:04:53.723
Don't give me that again.

01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:59.338
Surprise me, solve
one of the questions.

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:00.074
Alright.

01:05:00.209 --> 01:05:02.900
I'll tell you what could've
happened from what you've told me.

01:05:03.067 --> 01:05:05.398
- Please.
- Let's go back to the station,

01:05:05.422 --> 01:05:08.787
where the blackmailer had
to contact you at 5 p.m.

01:05:13.567 --> 01:05:14.992
It's 5 o'clock. It must be him.

01:05:17.214 --> 01:05:18.951
We shouldn't be seen together.

01:05:32.054 --> 01:05:32.805
Hello?

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:35.300
I'll wait for you in
the Hotel Bellavista.

01:05:36.066 --> 01:05:40.051
It's only accessible by using the
cog railway around the valley.

01:05:40.894 --> 01:05:45.114
I reserved room 715 for you.

01:05:46.991 --> 01:05:50.119
Another thing: Leave the
cell phone in the bin.

01:05:50.239 --> 01:05:54.284
Take the train that's
right in front of you.

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.657
If you don't leave
the cell phone,

01:05:56.681 --> 01:05:59.258
the police will discover
the body of Daniel Garrido.

01:06:42.291 --> 01:06:44.364
I'll ask. Wait here, okay?

01:06:52.025 --> 01:06:53.986
- Hello, good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

01:06:54.345 --> 01:06:57.522
I have a reservation.
Room 715, please.

01:06:59.925 --> 01:07:02.166
Yes, in the name
of Adrian Doria?

01:07:03.729 --> 01:07:05.606
Fill in this form

01:07:05.826 --> 01:07:07.405
and I'll get your key.

01:08:05.165 --> 01:08:06.375
Did anyone see you?

01:08:07.918 --> 01:08:09.482
Did he leave instructions?

01:08:10.477 --> 01:08:11.477
We have to wait.

01:08:17.024 --> 01:08:18.024
Something wrong?

01:08:18.451 --> 01:08:20.341
He just sent me a
message from your phone.

01:08:20.366 --> 01:08:22.286
I'll TELL EVERYTHING. ROOM 715.
HOTEL BELLAVISTA.

01:08:22.649 --> 01:08:23.649
It's a trap.

01:08:24.059 --> 01:08:25.059
Let's go.

01:08:38.322 --> 01:08:39.322
Adrian?

01:08:43.434 --> 01:08:44.471
No, no, no.

01:08:44.496 --> 01:08:46.122
No, no. Please.

01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:49.542
I don't know where he is.
It wasn't me.

01:08:49.736 --> 01:08:51.613
It wasn't me, I don't
know where he is.

01:09:03.301 --> 01:09:04.301
Hold on.

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.143
Hold on.

01:09:06.721 --> 01:09:09.313
You suspect that Tomas Garrido
was the person in the room?

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:10.479
Don't you?

01:09:10.942 --> 01:09:13.444
It's a plausible option to
use to build your defence,

01:09:13.767 --> 01:09:15.499
something the judge could buy.

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:19.676
Tomas Garrido has a powerful
motive for committing murder.

01:09:22.242 --> 01:09:24.161
If a father knows
that the police

01:09:24.328 --> 01:09:27.122
are protecting those responsible
for his son's disappearance,

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:30.591
he has only one option:
force them to face up to it.

01:09:30.616 --> 01:09:34.087
And killing one to incriminate
the other is a way to do it.

01:09:34.254 --> 01:09:35.336
Exactly.

01:09:35.524 --> 01:09:37.446
And it worked out perfectly.

01:09:37.685 --> 01:09:40.300
Everyone thought
you were guilty.

01:09:40.323 --> 01:09:43.636
The police, your own wife,
and your financial partners.

01:09:44.050 --> 01:09:47.321
Tomas Garrido not only framed
you for your lover's death,

01:09:47.594 --> 01:09:49.626
he destroyed your
life and your company.

01:09:50.032 --> 01:09:54.015
And only Felix could get you out
of jail on a million-Euro bail.

01:09:54.336 --> 01:09:56.367
Together you set up
the theory of the plot

01:09:56.391 --> 01:09:59.254
and I suspect he hired me

01:09:59.367 --> 01:10:01.202
because he wasn't
confident it'd be enough.

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:04.909
Your lawyer knew that if
your story convinced me,

01:10:05.595 --> 01:10:07.013
it'd convince a jury.

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:10.725
You hired someone to tell me
what to say in a trial, Felix?

01:10:10.749 --> 01:10:13.085
She's the top person
at preparing witnesses.

01:10:13.357 --> 01:10:17.065
She retired two weeks ago, but
she's taking this as a last case.

01:10:17.089 --> 01:10:20.343
And I assure you, she
doesn't want to lose it.

01:10:20.615 --> 01:10:25.025
The only way you can show that
you didn't kill your lover

01:10:25.285 --> 01:10:27.101
is to implicate Tomas Garrido,

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:30.155
and that means confessing
what you did to his son.

01:10:34.711 --> 01:10:36.125
Sure, but that does us no good

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:38.856
unless we work out how he got
out of the room without a trace.

01:10:39.367 --> 01:10:41.635
And when I came to,
there was no one.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.343
Help!

01:10:44.053 --> 01:10:45.053
Police!

01:10:46.443 --> 01:10:50.389
Are you familiar with the
concept of lateral thinking?

01:10:51.773 --> 01:10:55.274
It consists of changing
the perspective from which

01:10:55.298 --> 01:10:57.008
one analyses events.

01:10:57.327 --> 01:11:01.543
For example: in a wooden
barn that is completely empty

01:11:01.975 --> 01:11:05.317
a man is found hanging from
the middle of the main beam.

01:11:06.536 --> 01:11:09.163
The rope he hanged himself
with is 10 feet long

01:11:09.425 --> 01:11:12.229
and his feet are 10
inches above the floor.

01:11:13.417 --> 01:11:16.183
The nearest wall
is 20 feet away.

01:11:16.582 --> 01:11:19.835
You can't climb the
walls or reach the beam,

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:22.568
yet the man hanged himself.

01:11:23.798 --> 01:11:24.866
How did he do it?

01:11:27.264 --> 01:11:30.140
He climbed onto a block of
ice that melted from the heat.

01:11:31.538 --> 01:11:33.968
This is our barn.

01:11:36.744 --> 01:11:39.521
The police photo
file on your case.

01:11:44.278 --> 01:11:48.222
The answer has to be in the
nature of your own story.

01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:55.374
I don't know what
you expect me to see.

01:11:55.398 --> 01:11:57.234
The details, Mr. Doria.

01:11:58.069 --> 01:11:59.692
Focus on the details.

01:12:01.271 --> 01:12:03.957
They've always been
in front of our eyes,

01:12:04.281 --> 01:12:07.293
but you have to analyse them
from a different perspective.

01:12:10.534 --> 01:12:14.404
What if the answer to the enigma
was never inside the room,

01:12:15.582 --> 01:12:16.625
but outside?

01:12:16.792 --> 01:12:18.835
Now she works near
Bierge, in the valley,

01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:20.045
20 minutes from home.

01:12:20.504 --> 01:12:23.289
Being lured to that hotel so
far away is no coincidence.

01:12:23.523 --> 01:12:26.025
Tomas Garrido set
a trap for you.

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.897
He could've sent you
that package himself

01:12:31.367 --> 01:12:34.565
so you'd put the pieces of
the puzzle together wrongly

01:12:35.290 --> 01:12:38.086
and make you doubt
what really happened,

01:12:38.404 --> 01:12:42.773
because it was the only way
he'd find the missing piece.

01:12:44.486 --> 01:12:45.486
Hello?

01:12:45.832 --> 01:12:48.001
I'll wait for you in
the Hotel Bellavista.

01:12:48.156 --> 01:12:49.979
He couldn't have
known about the swamp.

01:12:50.003 --> 01:12:53.078
The area where you buried
him is full of swampy lakes

01:12:53.245 --> 01:12:54.815
and the locals know it.

01:12:55.205 --> 01:12:59.167
Tomas Garrido only had
to toss a coin in the air

01:12:59.635 --> 01:13:01.237
and wait for you to bite.

01:13:04.923 --> 01:13:06.159
And you did.

01:13:06.967 --> 01:13:09.344
- Was that what happened?
- You revealed yourself

01:13:10.543 --> 01:13:12.047
and gave up Laura.

01:14:41.939 --> 01:14:44.441
Here's your key
and have nice stay.

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:45.982
- Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:47.859
- Good afternoon.
- Hello, good afternoon.

01:14:48.026 --> 01:14:50.028
I have a reservation.
Room 715, please.

01:14:50.195 --> 01:14:51.948
That was how Tomas Garrido

01:14:51.972 --> 01:14:54.991
was able to get into the
room without leaving a trace.

01:14:55.276 --> 01:14:56.793
All he had to do

01:14:56.817 --> 01:14:59.362
was wait for you and Laura
to go up to the room.

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:03.037
From there he could send the
message from Laura's phone...

01:15:03.893 --> 01:15:06.062
He just sent me a
message from your phone.

01:15:06.822 --> 01:15:09.449
Knock you out to keep
you out of action,

01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:14.344
and carry out the perfect crime.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.555
- Did you hear that?
- If it was like that,

01:15:18.579 --> 01:15:22.124
Tomas Garrido only had to
prepare the scene to frame you

01:15:22.345 --> 01:15:25.890
and vanish the way out
his wife had set out.

01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:28.400
He left the money to frame you,

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:31.203
put Laura's cell phone
back in the room...

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:36.086
and made sure they found your
prints on the murder weapon.

01:15:49.379 --> 01:15:52.100
Hello? Is everything alright?

01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:55.152
No one's come out.

01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:02.010
Hello?

01:16:34.966 --> 01:16:36.488
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:16:36.512 --> 01:16:38.012
Where did the noises come from?

01:16:38.036 --> 01:16:40.372
A suite. Number 715.

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:08.062
Out of the way! Out
of the way, please!

01:17:13.574 --> 01:17:14.860
Police!

01:17:15.423 --> 01:17:16.423
Open the door.

01:17:33.339 --> 01:17:34.710
Everyone out!

01:17:34.734 --> 01:17:36.069
Come on, out.

01:17:38.159 --> 01:17:39.471
Call Forensics.

01:17:40.048 --> 01:17:42.947
Guys, tell Forensics,
we've found a body.

01:17:43.607 --> 01:17:44.607
Roger that.

01:17:54.028 --> 01:17:57.144
The kid's mother was why
they took us to that hotel.

01:17:58.091 --> 01:17:59.464
All she had to do

01:17:59.488 --> 01:18:02.783
was make her husband vanish
so that I'd look guilty.

01:18:04.056 --> 01:18:06.392
And the police never
linked her to you

01:18:06.599 --> 01:18:10.058
because Felix erased your
name from his son's case.

01:18:12.144 --> 01:18:13.144
Excuse me.

01:18:17.395 --> 01:18:18.395
Hello.

01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:21.230
Confirmed?

01:18:22.793 --> 01:18:23.793
One hundred per cent?

01:18:25.919 --> 01:18:27.761
Good. Alright, thanks.

01:18:28.854 --> 01:18:30.234
The prosecutor's witness?

01:18:30.695 --> 01:18:33.462
We still don't have his
name, but we know who he is.

01:18:34.291 --> 01:18:35.335
The driver.

01:18:36.597 --> 01:18:38.399
It means we have to think fast.

01:18:38.423 --> 01:18:41.498
- It also means I'm screwed.
- Not totally, if you obey me.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.637
Suppose you weren't in the
cabin with your lover that day.

01:18:47.108 --> 01:18:49.402
You were in Paris,
as your alibi says.

01:18:49.712 --> 01:18:52.373
Laura rented it, it's
only in her name.

01:18:56.065 --> 01:19:00.961
So you weren't at the accident
that killed Daniel Garrido.

01:19:01.235 --> 01:19:02.235
Hello?

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:06.184
The license plate and the other
evidence is circumstantial.

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:09.055
Therefore, it was Laura
who carried out the plan,

01:19:09.079 --> 01:19:11.279
faking that the kid was fleeing
because of embezzlement.

01:19:15.126 --> 01:19:16.839
We have to convince the judge

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:19.440
that you were one more
of Laura's victims

01:19:19.687 --> 01:19:23.119
and you ended up in that hotel room
because she asked you for help.

01:19:23.365 --> 01:19:26.452
Perhaps you knew nothing about
Daniel Garrido until that moment

01:19:26.565 --> 01:19:29.680
and the father is unjustly
accusing you of his disappearance.

01:19:29.849 --> 01:19:31.448
You want to turn me
into Laura's victim?

01:19:32.897 --> 01:19:34.899
The only piece we're missing

01:19:35.686 --> 01:19:38.684
is a way to link her
directly to Daniel's body.

01:19:38.708 --> 01:19:39.708
Tell me one thing.

01:19:39.923 --> 01:19:41.132
How will you do it?

01:19:41.801 --> 01:19:45.131
Hiding an object of Laura's
in the submerged car.

01:19:45.933 --> 01:19:50.254
We have to incriminate only
her in Daniel's disappearance.

01:19:53.527 --> 01:19:54.794
Your only crime

01:19:55.364 --> 01:19:57.958
will be having covered
it up unwillingly.

01:20:09.924 --> 01:20:10.938
Where did you sink it?

01:20:14.432 --> 01:20:16.862
We'll inform the police about
the body's location anonymously.

01:20:16.886 --> 01:20:18.514
You won't have to admit a thing.

01:20:18.837 --> 01:20:21.131
But no body, no crime,
and without a crime,

01:20:21.285 --> 01:20:24.163
we can't convince a
jury that Laura's murder

01:20:24.336 --> 01:20:25.876
wasn't a crime of passion.

01:20:26.602 --> 01:20:30.398
We'll get close enough to the
truth that you don't get burnt.

01:20:31.034 --> 01:20:34.370
How can I not get burnt if the
prosecutor holds the trump card?

01:20:35.456 --> 01:20:36.583
Hello. Hello.

01:20:36.749 --> 01:20:38.852
The driver will place
me at the crash scene.

01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:39.627
Need any help?

01:20:39.794 --> 01:20:41.714
Felix has been looking
for him to neutralize him.

01:20:41.815 --> 01:20:43.564
The prosecutor has no witness.

01:20:44.924 --> 01:20:45.890
What's that?

01:20:45.914 --> 01:20:47.749
No one's seen the judge.

01:20:48.094 --> 01:20:50.763
I made it up and
adjusted it in line with

01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:53.308
the details you've given me.

01:20:53.956 --> 01:20:55.369
Are you kidding me?

01:20:55.393 --> 01:20:57.811
Why didn't you tell me
the truth from the start?

01:21:02.199 --> 01:21:05.211
To find out if you could get Tomas
Garrido to vanish from the room.

01:21:09.066 --> 01:21:11.110
I've always known he was guilty.

01:21:14.212 --> 01:21:16.962
And it wasn't hard to find out
that his wife works in the hotel.

01:21:19.857 --> 01:21:22.067
Why did you wait
for me to tell you?

01:21:22.255 --> 01:21:26.140
To make sure I can put my life
in your hands, Ms. Goodman.

01:21:31.254 --> 01:21:32.547
Where did you sink it?

01:21:41.482 --> 01:21:42.984
It was here.

01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:07.706
I have something
else to tell you.

01:22:22.398 --> 01:22:24.813
We thought he was dead, I swear.

01:22:31.155 --> 01:22:33.574
Laura had taken it so far,
there was no turning back.

01:22:33.741 --> 01:22:36.611
If the police found the kid,
the autopsy would give me away.

01:22:37.122 --> 01:22:39.377
I had to be sure
you'd help me stop it.

01:22:41.992 --> 01:22:46.045
It's my duty to save you from
jail, not from who you are.

01:22:46.212 --> 01:22:48.125
Rubbish, Mr. Doria.

01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:50.063
And you'll take what I
say because you need me.

01:22:50.087 --> 01:22:53.549
The kid was virtually dead, I
had to decide in a split second.

01:22:55.562 --> 01:22:59.484
Don't lie to yourself.
You're a murderer!

01:22:59.508 --> 01:23:01.011
You're testing me again, right?

01:23:01.578 --> 01:23:03.663
So I can handle the
prosecutor's attacks.

01:23:03.864 --> 01:23:05.903
What you've said
changes everything.

01:23:05.927 --> 01:23:07.642
Now you're on my hands.

01:23:08.759 --> 01:23:12.310
You've told me enough.
If I tell the judge this,

01:23:12.334 --> 01:23:13.489
you're ruined.

01:23:13.595 --> 01:23:15.013
But you can't do that!

01:23:16.915 --> 01:23:18.276
You hear me? You can't.

01:23:18.804 --> 01:23:23.142
That's what the prosecutor
will look for, your despair.

01:23:23.166 --> 01:23:25.594
And look how easy I
got it out of you.

01:23:26.232 --> 01:23:28.318
You want to insult me? Go ahead.

01:23:28.664 --> 01:23:30.536
The prosecutor will be
looking for that too,

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.308
to bring out the arrogant
fool you have inside.

01:23:33.332 --> 01:23:34.375
That's enough!

01:23:37.532 --> 01:23:39.201
Aren't you here to defend me?

01:23:41.511 --> 01:23:42.632
Then defend me.

01:24:03.150 --> 01:24:05.939
I won't let my record be
tainted on my last day.

01:24:09.007 --> 01:24:12.010
From now on, we'll
do things my way.

01:24:12.529 --> 01:24:15.736
For that I need to be sure that
there are no more loose ends.

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.423
- There aren't.
- There aren't?

01:24:17.447 --> 01:24:19.533
But I think you're
still using me.

01:24:19.922 --> 01:24:22.544
Testing your adulterated
version of the facts on me,

01:24:22.568 --> 01:24:23.577
like I'm a puppet.

01:24:23.601 --> 01:24:24.931
Which part doesn't fit?

01:24:24.955 --> 01:24:27.582
True, it all could've
happened the way you said.

01:24:27.982 --> 01:24:30.073
But what if it wasn't you

01:24:30.097 --> 01:24:33.293
who broke the promise not
to meet again, but Laura?

01:24:34.059 --> 01:24:36.691
How did you make the police
think Daniel Garrido had fled?

01:24:37.304 --> 01:24:39.051
See you in 4 hours in the bar

01:24:39.075 --> 01:24:40.493
- in front of the scrapyard.
- Okay.

01:24:40.766 --> 01:24:42.930
- Don't be late.
- Okay, yes, I'll be there.

01:24:42.954 --> 01:24:45.998
Redirecting small amounts
from his customers

01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:47.977
shortly before disappearing.

01:24:49.210 --> 01:24:51.846
You could've gotten
the kid's things too.

01:24:52.509 --> 01:24:54.288
Adrian, what is all this?

01:24:55.106 --> 01:24:56.402
The kid's wallet.

01:24:57.522 --> 01:24:59.849
I got it before I
put him in the trunk.

01:25:01.465 --> 01:25:04.873
Put a price on it. You've always
had the means and contacts

01:25:04.993 --> 01:25:06.995
to change the course of events

01:25:07.183 --> 01:25:08.664
without leaving a trail.

01:25:08.688 --> 01:25:09.688
I'll take care of it.

01:25:10.694 --> 01:25:11.694
That's not true.

01:25:12.567 --> 01:25:14.652
- You can't prove it.
- Nor you the opposite.

01:25:14.986 --> 01:25:16.784
Let's look at it backwards.

01:25:18.498 --> 01:25:19.229
Hello.

01:25:19.253 --> 01:25:20.884
Wouldn't the pieces fit

01:25:20.908 --> 01:25:24.203
if you'd taken the
initiative in all of this?

01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:26.314
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

01:25:26.338 --> 01:25:28.955
Listen, it wasn't our
fault, it was the damn deer.

01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:30.793
Are you crazy?

01:25:32.253 --> 01:25:34.255
- What if he saw something?
- He didn't.

01:25:34.568 --> 01:25:35.666
We have to get rid of him.

01:25:39.258 --> 01:25:40.519
What if Laura was the one

01:25:40.543 --> 01:25:43.708
dragged into a desperate
situation impossible to control?

01:25:46.601 --> 01:25:48.561
According to this
medical report,

01:25:48.879 --> 01:25:51.772
your lover had acute
anxiety attacks

01:25:51.939 --> 01:25:54.772
after her return from your
supposed trip to Paris.

01:25:55.882 --> 01:25:58.672
Even someone as heartless
as her can break down.

01:25:58.696 --> 01:26:01.481
That's exactly what doesn't
fit for me, Mr. Doria.

01:26:02.347 --> 01:26:04.308
That she instigated it all,

01:26:04.332 --> 01:26:06.584
would support that you
would've saved that kid.

01:26:07.055 --> 01:26:08.640
But you drowned him.

01:26:12.031 --> 01:26:14.712
POSSIBLE INVOLUNTARY
DISAPPEARANCE

01:26:17.632 --> 01:26:20.481
And guilt of it
bore down on her,

01:26:23.554 --> 01:26:25.021
slowly dragging her down.

01:26:32.539 --> 01:26:36.543
Where Adrian Doria just
received the European Award

01:26:37.151 --> 01:26:38.527
for Businessman of the Year.

01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:42.557
Until she saw there was only
one way to regain her dignity.

01:26:48.683 --> 01:26:51.500
She couldn't give those poor
parents their son back...

01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:56.255
- My companion was there.
- But something she could do

01:26:57.893 --> 01:26:59.327
was tell them the truth.

01:27:03.636 --> 01:27:04.636
Daniel.

01:27:05.735 --> 01:27:07.772
So she arranged to
meet them in the hotel

01:27:07.796 --> 01:27:09.121
where the mother worked.

01:27:09.670 --> 01:27:12.146
An out of the way place
to carry out her plan.

01:27:13.813 --> 01:27:16.297
She went to Bierge alone
and crossed the valley.

01:27:19.258 --> 01:27:20.858
When she got to the
station by the hotel,

01:27:22.353 --> 01:27:24.129
she called you
from a public phone

01:27:24.153 --> 01:27:26.125
so you wouldn't
suspect anything.

01:27:29.113 --> 01:27:30.262
Somebody knows something.

01:27:30.936 --> 01:27:33.892
She made you believe the
driver had seen something...

01:27:33.916 --> 01:27:35.985
Then why answer the phone?

01:27:36.009 --> 01:27:38.396
And had found her and
was blackmailing them.

01:27:39.748 --> 01:27:43.377
It was her way of compensating
those poor people for their loss.

01:27:44.343 --> 01:27:47.763
She hadn't the courage to
confess it with her hands empty.

01:27:49.324 --> 01:27:52.005
Once in the hotel room,
she just had to wait

01:27:53.086 --> 01:27:55.157
and put the second part
of her plan in motion.

01:27:56.053 --> 01:27:57.543
She programmed a
message into her phone

01:27:57.567 --> 01:27:59.324
as a protective measure.

01:28:02.111 --> 01:28:04.810
Laura knew you'd
refuse to confess,

01:28:05.464 --> 01:28:07.676
because you only
care about one thing:

01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:08.998
yourself.

01:28:14.246 --> 01:28:16.210
You made sure no
one saw you arrive

01:28:16.234 --> 01:28:18.199
at the room where
Laura was waiting.

01:28:26.313 --> 01:28:28.918
But Laura had already crossed
the point of no return.

01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:33.950
And when she told you her
plan, you lost your head.

01:28:42.215 --> 01:28:44.379
When you got her
programmed message,

01:28:44.403 --> 01:28:46.812
you realized that you'd
fallen into her trap.

01:28:57.016 --> 01:28:58.786
The reservation's
in your name too.

01:29:01.531 --> 01:29:02.891
We're going to give
them the money.

01:29:04.364 --> 01:29:06.401
We're going to tell them
where you buried their son

01:29:06.425 --> 01:29:09.929
and we're going to turn
ourselves in, Adrian.

01:29:12.022 --> 01:29:13.409
There's no turning back.

01:29:36.205 --> 01:29:37.540
I didn't kill her

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:41.770
and I'll never testify before a jury.
Never.

01:29:41.794 --> 01:29:43.628
You killed her and
you were trapped

01:29:43.652 --> 01:29:45.389
in a room you
couldn't escape from.

01:29:48.889 --> 01:29:51.390
Hello? Is everything alright?

01:30:02.523 --> 01:30:05.151
You thought the message
could be useful to you

01:30:06.277 --> 01:30:09.962
and you searched for elements
to back your wild theory.

01:30:17.413 --> 01:30:18.413
Police!

01:30:21.192 --> 01:30:22.192
Are you alright?

01:30:25.745 --> 01:30:26.745
Police!

01:30:29.884 --> 01:30:32.422
Fine. You want to play?

01:30:33.315 --> 01:30:34.316
Let's play.

01:30:35.641 --> 01:30:37.648
Why haven't Tomas Garrido
or his wife spoken up?

01:30:38.358 --> 01:30:41.789
If Laura was going to tell them
the truth, why not call the police?

01:30:41.813 --> 01:30:43.498
They know you'll never
incriminate yourself

01:30:43.522 --> 01:30:46.300
by digging up their son's body,

01:30:47.033 --> 01:30:50.386
and without a body it's
hard to prove a crime.

01:30:50.410 --> 01:30:51.655
And they also know

01:30:51.888 --> 01:30:54.877
you'd do anything
to get away with it,

01:30:55.576 --> 01:30:59.163
even framing them for
your lover's death.

01:31:00.417 --> 01:31:01.417
Come with me.

01:31:13.725 --> 01:31:16.415
Second window on the right
of the second last floor.

01:31:18.224 --> 01:31:20.982
Take a good look, Mister Dorian.

01:31:26.690 --> 01:31:30.027
Tomas Garrido stopped trusting
the police a long time ago,

01:31:30.299 --> 01:31:33.162
and since then he's
been watching you

01:31:33.186 --> 01:31:35.154
in order to take justice
into his own hands.

01:31:46.502 --> 01:31:48.414
You assume things
you can't know.

01:31:48.438 --> 01:31:51.107
I know more about him
than you think. Why?

01:31:51.571 --> 01:31:53.443
You're smart. Work it out.

01:31:53.467 --> 01:31:55.010
I want an answer.

01:31:56.558 --> 01:31:58.649
When Tomas and his
wife got to the hotel

01:31:59.047 --> 01:32:00.749
and found out about
Laura's death,

01:32:01.222 --> 01:32:03.028
they understood
what had happened.

01:32:04.161 --> 01:32:06.193
They probably
studied their chances

01:32:06.217 --> 01:32:07.457
and hesitated about what to do,

01:32:07.879 --> 01:32:10.048
but with no faith in justice,
what was left for them?

01:32:10.209 --> 01:32:12.308
Watch their enemy and wait.

01:32:12.925 --> 01:32:14.593
All they could do was watch you.

01:32:22.909 --> 01:32:25.912
Tomas Garrido
became your shadow.

01:32:31.653 --> 01:32:34.072
He found a vacant room
opposite your building

01:32:34.319 --> 01:32:36.613
and took it over anonymously.

01:32:37.455 --> 01:32:40.264
Since then, he's had you

01:32:40.536 --> 01:32:43.122
and anyone near
you in his sights.

01:32:43.342 --> 01:32:45.978
Every meeting,
every conversation,

01:32:46.145 --> 01:32:47.828
every move you've
made to get free,

01:32:48.272 --> 01:32:50.841
Tomas Garrido has been
there to witness it.

01:32:52.035 --> 01:32:53.971
And of course he got to me.

01:33:01.478 --> 01:33:04.189
Who was he and what was he
doing in front of my office?

01:33:08.799 --> 01:33:11.719
I realized that he
was following Felix,

01:33:12.396 --> 01:33:15.663
so I had him watched.

01:33:18.663 --> 01:33:21.583
The kid's father brought
you to me, not the reverse.

01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:24.962
He gave you the thread to
pull to reach Daniel Garrido.

01:33:34.393 --> 01:33:37.611
This photo proves it all
could've happened the way I said.

01:33:37.938 --> 01:33:40.899
You're still not listening or
paying attention to the details.

01:33:41.066 --> 01:33:42.730
The kid's mother
was in the room.

01:33:42.754 --> 01:33:44.894
She was off that day.

01:33:45.290 --> 01:33:47.454
She went there with her
husband to meet Laura.

01:33:47.478 --> 01:33:49.433
This photo proves that...

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:51.561
This photo is a fake.

01:33:53.557 --> 01:33:55.291
It's been manipulated,
it's a set-up.

01:33:58.697 --> 01:34:00.165
Look at the mirror.

01:34:07.413 --> 01:34:08.541
Now tell me:

01:34:09.489 --> 01:34:10.489
Do you want my help?

01:34:11.425 --> 01:34:13.553
For the judge to believe you?

01:34:13.807 --> 01:34:16.722
Then admit that
you killed Laura.

01:34:16.746 --> 01:34:17.746
I killed her.

01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:38.301
Adrian, are you there?
Your phone's off.

01:34:38.582 --> 01:34:40.082
Call me when you can.

01:34:40.907 --> 01:34:43.493
The miracle we hoped
for has happened.

01:34:47.841 --> 01:34:51.006
Here, this is your
boarding card.

01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:52.030
Seat B52.

01:34:56.332 --> 01:34:58.402
Talk to him, it
sounds important.

01:34:59.812 --> 01:35:02.260
10 minutes break and
we'll start over.

01:35:03.607 --> 01:35:05.651
I know the strategy
for your defence.

01:35:06.026 --> 01:35:07.026
Don't worry.

01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:10.270
I'm going out to clear my head.

01:35:10.636 --> 01:35:12.062
- Do you have coffee?
- Yes.

01:35:13.104 --> 01:35:15.873
We'll need it. It's
going to be a long night.

01:35:16.187 --> 01:35:17.187
Okay.

01:35:26.457 --> 01:35:27.458
Ms. Goodman.

01:35:36.306 --> 01:35:37.306
Thank you.

01:36:05.335 --> 01:36:07.082
- Felix.
- I've been calling you.

01:36:07.106 --> 01:36:08.509
My phone went off. What is it?

01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:09.877
I found him.

01:36:10.549 --> 01:36:12.801
You were never on that road.

01:36:13.972 --> 01:36:15.290
Can we trust him?

01:36:20.684 --> 01:36:21.935
Completely.

01:36:23.774 --> 01:36:25.364
That's perfect.

01:36:27.357 --> 01:36:28.856
How is it with Virginia Goodman?

01:36:29.377 --> 01:36:31.015
I had to tell her everything.

01:36:31.987 --> 01:36:34.126
- Everything?
- Everything.

01:36:34.846 --> 01:36:36.065
How do you feel?

01:36:37.492 --> 01:36:39.786
You're right, she's very good.

01:36:41.633 --> 01:36:42.860
We can trust her.

01:36:45.465 --> 01:36:49.681
What was that prosecutor story?
The plane noise drowned you out.

01:36:49.851 --> 01:36:51.138
Nothing, don't worry.

01:36:53.717 --> 01:36:55.177
What the hell was that?

01:36:55.343 --> 01:36:56.428
What's going on?

01:36:56.970 --> 01:36:58.112
Felix, can you hear me?

01:37:06.688 --> 01:37:09.212
- Are you there?
- I'll call you back.

01:37:11.529 --> 01:37:12.629
Shit...

01:37:27.584 --> 01:37:28.883
No one's seen the judge.

01:37:28.907 --> 01:37:30.256
COWARD, MURDERER, IMPOSTOR

01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:31.800
The prosecutor has no witness.

01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:35.671
I made it up and
adjusted it in line with

01:37:35.695 --> 01:37:37.239
the details you've given me.

01:37:37.688 --> 01:37:40.941
- This photo shows...
- This photo is a fake.

01:37:41.287 --> 01:37:42.663
It's been manipulated.

01:37:43.642 --> 01:37:45.324
You assume things
you can't know.

01:37:45.348 --> 01:37:47.291
I know more about
him than you think.

01:37:47.315 --> 01:37:47.986
Why?

01:37:48.010 --> 01:37:50.095
You're smart. Work it out.

01:37:50.922 --> 01:37:53.299
My wife and I know
our son is dead.

01:37:53.491 --> 01:37:54.669
We just want to find him,

01:37:54.693 --> 01:37:56.361
bury him and let
him rest in peace.

01:37:56.511 --> 01:37:58.655
But with no faith in justice,
what was left for them?

01:37:58.679 --> 01:38:00.640
Watch their enemy and wait.

01:38:01.530 --> 01:38:04.121
That was how we met,
in a theatre group.

01:38:06.052 --> 01:38:09.597
You've told me enough.
If I tell the judge this,

01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:11.177
you're ruined.

01:38:11.201 --> 01:38:12.754
Now you're on my hands.

01:38:13.477 --> 01:38:16.063
Adrian, are you there?
Your phone's off.

01:38:19.147 --> 01:38:20.209
All under control.

01:38:24.832 --> 01:38:27.328
And the Garridos suspect
that you and your lover

01:38:27.352 --> 01:38:28.395
are the culprits.

01:38:28.728 --> 01:38:29.938
She's dead,

01:38:30.105 --> 01:38:32.415
so all that's left... is you.

01:38:38.597 --> 01:38:39.681
Where did you bury him?

01:39:03.930 --> 01:39:06.247
There'll be no salvation
without suffering,

01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:09.016
and you're not
smarter than I am.

01:39:24.986 --> 01:39:27.780
SONIA AND ALEX
MOTHER AND DAUGHTER

01:41:13.727 --> 01:41:14.737
Police. Can I help you?

01:41:15.067 --> 01:41:16.193
Mr. Doria?

01:41:16.394 --> 01:41:17.645
My name is Tomas Garrido.

01:41:17.866 --> 01:41:19.205
I'm Virginia Goodman.

01:41:19.803 --> 01:41:21.805
I'm Daniel Garrido's father.

01:41:24.237 --> 01:41:26.647
I want to tell you the truth
about what happened to my son.
