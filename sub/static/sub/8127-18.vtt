00:56.156 --> 00:59.658
I wonder if it's                
the same Mervyn Jerome.         

00:59.660 --> 01:01.026
            Who's Mervyn Jerome?

01:01.028 --> 01:03.895
         He used to run         
      the animal hospital       

01:03.897 --> 01:07.132
         where we used          
    to take Arthur, our cat.    

01:07.134 --> 01:10.401
         And Mr. Jerome         
  went to my high school too.   

01:10.403 --> 01:12.971
            Oh, my.             
    He was such a nice man.     

01:12.973 --> 01:15.473
    He was very close           
        to his animals.         

01:15.475 --> 01:20.244
    Archie always said          
 you couldn't smell 'em apart.  

01:20.246 --> 01:22.981
  Of course, that was a joke.   

01:22.983 --> 01:26.718
  It made Mr. Jerome laugh...   
        sometimes.

                What made you

is in the paper,

             Air Corps reunions?

06:28.788 --> 06:30.121
    Oh, now, come on.           

06:30.123 --> 06:32.823
     Are you comparing this     
    high school stupid stuff    

06:32.825 --> 06:34.859
to my Air Corps reunions?       

06:34.861 --> 06:37.362
     Our Air Corps reunions     
was held to "re-memorate"       

06:37.364 --> 06:38.762
 the great things we had done.  

06:38.764 --> 06:41.699
      Yeah, like bombing,       
      strafing, killing...      

06:41.701 --> 06:43.934
     Get away from me, huh?     

06:43.936 --> 06:45.936
      If your mother wants to go
      to that class reunion,    

06:45.938 --> 06:47.372
                     she can go 
                     without me.

06:47.374 --> 06:50.074
     Oh, Daddy, you know Ma     
never goes anywhere without you.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.309
Russell's taking me.            

06:51.311 --> 06:53.378
      Well, I ain't going,      
    and that's final.           

06:53.380 --> 06:55.713
Maybe this'll                   
change your mind, Edith.        

06:55.715 --> 06:58.582
I brought you a copy            
of the old school paper.        

06:58.584 --> 07:00.751
         <i>The Milestone?</i>         

07:00.753 --> 07:02.153
Yeah,                           
I had reprints made             

07:02.155 --> 07:03.154
for everybody                   
in the class.                   

07:03.156 --> 07:04.522
Here.                           

07:04.524 --> 07:07.791
Oh, look. Here's a picture      
      of the whole class.       

07:07.793 --> 07:09.994
            Let me see, Ma.     
            Which one is you?   

07:09.996 --> 07:12.997
There I am. Edith Baines.       

07:12.999 --> 07:15.466
                    Oh, you look
                    so young.   

07:15.468 --> 07:17.768
That's because                  
I was younger then.             

07:22.474 --> 07:24.808
  Archie, look, here's Amelia.  

07:24.810 --> 07:28.046
    Oh, look at Amelia          
      with all the braces.      

07:28.048 --> 07:30.648
 Jeez, what a face full of wire 
            you had.            

07:32.351 --> 07:34.785
         1943... Ma, can Michael
         and I look at this?    

07:34.787 --> 07:35.786
             Sure.              

07:35.788 --> 07:38.156
We were kids then, Archie.      

07:38.158 --> 07:41.292
        Everybody               
    had a face full of wire.    

07:41.294 --> 07:43.861
    Except Buck Evans.          
        He was perfect.         

07:43.863 --> 07:49.434
    Buck Evans... I haven't     
  thought about him in years.   

07:49.436 --> 07:51.402
 He was the handsomest thing... 

07:51.404 --> 07:53.804
 and Edith had a crush on him.  

07:53.806 --> 07:55.239
Oh...                           

07:55.241 --> 07:57.408
              Boy,              
  what a lousy Sunday this is.  

07:59.611 --> 08:03.814
        Oh, yeah,               
Buck Evans was so popular,      

08:03.816 --> 08:07.851
but he let me go with him       
    wherever he went.           

08:07.853 --> 08:10.054
            You know            
what they used to call me?      

08:10.056 --> 08:11.789
 "Who's that with Buck Evans?"  

08:15.594 --> 08:18.729
      Hey, Ma, which one is Buck
        in this picture?        

08:18.731 --> 08:20.998
      Oh, now, let's see.       

08:21.000 --> 08:23.901
    It's been so many years.    

08:23.903 --> 08:24.902
                    There he is!

08:24.904 --> 08:27.605
Oh, my...                       

08:27.607 --> 08:29.940
         Oh, is he good-looking.
                        Yeah.   

08:29.942 --> 08:34.611
      He was voted the Boy      
  Most Likely to Win the War.   

08:36.847 --> 08:39.183
        But that picture        
        don't do him justice.   

08:39.184 --> 08:42.086
    You had to see him          
      on the track field.       

08:42.087 --> 08:45.889
        Oh, he had              
    such a beautiful figure.    

08:45.891 --> 08:49.059
      And that golden hair      
     waving in the wind...      

08:49.061 --> 08:50.060
              Oh!               

08:50.062 --> 08:52.963
Sounds like a running fag.      

08:56.468 --> 08:58.436
He was anything but that.       

08:58.438 --> 09:00.471
         All the girls          
     were crazy about him.      

09:00.473 --> 09:03.207
  You, too, huh, Edith? Whoo!   

09:03.209 --> 09:04.542
Oh, yeah.                       

09:04.544 --> 09:07.145
             Remember? You used 
             to leave him notes.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.846
              "From an anonymous
                  admirer...    

09:08.848 --> 09:10.781
                      Signed,   
                  Edith Baines."

09:12.618 --> 09:14.452
                Why did you stop
                seeing him, Ma? 

09:14.454 --> 09:16.287
Well, he went                   
into the Air Corps.             

09:16.289 --> 09:19.357
Oh, my,                         
and in his uniform...           

09:19.359 --> 09:20.558
Ooh, he looked                  

09:20.560 --> 09:23.161
like the cover on one           
of those song sheets.           

09:23.163 --> 09:27.398
♪ He wore a pair                
Of silver wings... ♪            

09:27.400 --> 09:28.299
            Silver wings, oh!   

09:33.071 --> 09:34.238
  What's the matter with you?   

09:34.240 --> 09:35.839
You were in the Air Corps,      
          weren't you?          

09:35.841 --> 09:37.408
    That's right, Meathead.     

09:37.410 --> 09:39.477
     I was second in charge     
    of the motor pool.          

09:39.479 --> 09:42.079
 What'd you wear on your chest? 
      A little carburetor?      

09:46.652 --> 09:48.852
 Oh, Edith, I got to get going. 

09:48.854 --> 09:50.454
        Now, you're sure        
you won't change your mind      

09:50.456 --> 09:51.789
                 about coming   
                 to the reunion?

09:51.791 --> 09:54.692
Oh, no, Amelia.                 
I'm sorry.                      

09:54.694 --> 09:58.529
            Ah, Buck is gonna be
            awful disappointed. 

09:58.531 --> 10:01.365
Buck is coming                  
to the reunion?                 

10:01.367 --> 10:02.533
                      Sure.     
                Didn't you know?

10:02.535 --> 10:05.903
No. His name wasn't             
on the list you sent me.        

10:05.905 --> 10:08.606
Oh, but his answer came in late.
      He's gonna be there.      

10:08.608 --> 10:10.641
  Oh...                         

10:10.643 --> 10:12.210
      Archie, are you sure      
         you don't mind         

10:12.212 --> 10:14.111
    if I go to the reunion?     

10:14.113 --> 10:15.613
Well, wait                      
a minute, now. Uh...            

10:17.782 --> 10:20.084
            No. He doesn't mind.
            He said so 10 times.

10:20.086 --> 10:23.153
Oh... well, then,               
I think I'll go.                

10:23.155 --> 10:25.623
Yeah. I'm going                 
to the reunion.                 

10:25.625 --> 10:27.191
                Great. You're   
                going alone?    

10:27.193 --> 10:28.259
Why not?                        

10:28.261 --> 10:32.196
Hold it! Hold it there!         

10:32.198 --> 10:34.398
You ain't gonna do nothing      
of the kind there, Edith.       

10:34.400 --> 10:35.399
But, Archie...                  

10:35.401 --> 10:37.801
            No, no!             

10:37.803 --> 10:39.704
      I'm going with you.       

10:39.706 --> 10:41.305
              Because of        
              Buck Evans, Daddy?

10:41.307 --> 10:43.541
                    No!         

10:43.543 --> 10:46.844
    Because no real man lets    
 his wife go out alone at night 

10:46.846 --> 10:49.614
             after Buck... dark.

         I didn't ask,          
 "What's the spot? What is it?" 

11:38.998 --> 11:42.132
I asked, "What's the spot?      
 What's it still doing there?"  

11:42.134 --> 11:44.569

11:47.640 --> 11:49.773
         Why don't you just move
         your tie clip down?    

11:49.775 --> 11:51.676
          Or you could          
      tie your knot higher      

11:51.678 --> 11:54.111
and tuck the end in your pants. 

12:01.086 --> 12:04.054

    Come on. Let's go.          

12:06.925 --> 12:08.092
              Ma, you remembered
                  the ticket?

No. It ain't nice, Edith.       
        It's dumb.              

12:19.071 --> 12:21.772
    I'm your husband.           
      I ain't your friend.

                better hurry.
