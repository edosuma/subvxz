00:13.720 --> 00:15.000
- No.
- Can't leave him alive.

00:15.040 --> 00:17.566
Please go. I'll finish it.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.321
This is between us.

00:22.960 --> 00:24.840
Do it quickly. I'll be waiting outside.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.930
Hey, what happened to you?
I went out front and you were gone.

00:30.120 --> 00:32.281
There were police. Is it done?

00:32.439 --> 00:34.568
Yes. He's dead.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.643
Call Ellie.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.963
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

00:40.160 --> 00:43.164
It's about Tom. It's urgent.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.407
I could lose my license for this,
go to jail.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.489
- You owe me.
- Why aren't we at a hospital?

00:51.680 --> 00:53.921
- He could die.
- He cannot die.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.361
I'm gonna need supplies, proper tools.

00:58.120 --> 01:00.487
Steven, hey. It's me.
Listen, your boat...

01:00.960 --> 01:03.281
Is it still sitting empty
or did you find a buyer?

01:03.480 --> 01:04.891
He's lost too much blood.

01:08.920 --> 01:12.481
- You're a fed.
- He is responsible for Meera's death.

01:12.680 --> 01:15.286
You were her Cl. You said
if I found the man responsible...

01:15.480 --> 01:17.520
- I thought you would arrest him.
- I will.

01:17.720 --> 01:21.008
I just need you to babysit
for a little while until I get some info.

01:27.840 --> 01:31.208
Let's get this straight.
I did not save you because I care.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.728
I saved you
because you have intel on Berlin.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.921
I want a name.

01:39.080 --> 01:41.287
- You bitch.
- Oh, I don't know, Tom.

01:41.480 --> 01:44.165
From where I'm sitting,
you look like the bitch to me.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.244
You spied on others?
This what you do?

01:47.440 --> 01:49.442
- I don't remember.
- I want a name. What bank?

01:49.640 --> 01:53.008
Monarch Douglas in Warsaw.
It's where Berlin keeps his money.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.487
What about accounts,
names of shell companies?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.163
Did you murder Jolene Parker?
What about Reddington?

01:59.360 --> 02:00.930
- I don't know.
- What do you know?

02:01.120 --> 02:04.408
- I told you I don't know!
- What do you know about Reddington?!

02:04.640 --> 02:06.961
Stop asking me, I don't know!

02:07.160 --> 02:11.245
When you're convinced I have
nothing left to offer, what then?

02:11.480 --> 02:14.848
I asked you a question.
Gina Zanetakos.

02:15.040 --> 02:18.487
Because you know when this is over,
you're gonna have to kill me, right?

02:19.480 --> 02:22.324
How often did you communicate
with Berlin, his associates?

02:22.520 --> 02:26.411
Tell me about the guests at our wedding. if
you want Ellie to look at that infection...

02:26.600 --> 02:28.204
...you have to answer my question.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.244
- I need a doctor!
- I need a name!

02:31.560 --> 02:35.565
- What about the adoption?
- Isn't that what married people do?

02:36.040 --> 02:41.126
You know, all this time, you never
asked me if I ever really loved you.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.962
Because I know the answer.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.402
I don't think you do.

02:48.200 --> 02:51.409
You told me if I gave you Berlin
that you would let me go.

02:51.600 --> 02:57.050
I knew the second you brought me down
you had no intention of letting me leave.

03:00.560 --> 03:01.971
So here's the deal, Liz.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.090
You're gonna do whatever
you're gonna do. You always have.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.006
Just do me one favor.

03:12.280 --> 03:16.046
Look me in the eyes when you do it.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.890
Your daughter told me
your name is Milos Kirchhoff.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.890
All these years, Mr. Kirchhoff...

03:31.080 --> 03:34.448
...you've believed with the blackest of
hearts that I murdered your daughter.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.608
And yet here she is.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.369
The story was wrong, Milos.

03:39.560 --> 03:41.403
Please enlighten me.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.763
What were you told
and who did the telling?

03:46.840 --> 03:49.047
It was in '91.

03:49.760 --> 03:53.082
The Soviet Union was falling apart.

03:53.280 --> 03:57.365
A small group of us,
members of the Politburo...

03:57.560 --> 04:02.122
...the military, KGB, Stasi...

04:02.320 --> 04:06.689
...we had a plan to push back
the progressives...

04:06.880 --> 04:10.362
...to stem the tide.

04:10.600 --> 04:17.483
We were meeting and discussing
strategy when a bomb...

04:20.680 --> 04:21.966
The Kursk bombing.

04:22.160 --> 04:28.202
Fifteen men were killed
and with them, our resistance.

04:28.400 --> 04:32.246
Rumors began that the Americans
were involved.

04:32.760 --> 04:35.286
One name emerged.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.561
Yours.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.286
You came after my daughter.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.370
You exposed her as a dissident.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.961
She went to jail.

04:45.560 --> 04:49.121
After that, my loyalty was questioned.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.891
I was exiled to the Gulag...

04:52.080 --> 04:57.564
...where one by one
her bones were sent to me.

04:57.760 --> 05:01.242
You fled. You must have had help.
Who?

05:02.800 --> 05:04.802
There was a man.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.369
He said he could protect me from...
From you.

05:11.280 --> 05:17.049
- What was his name?
- I never met him. I don't know.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.971
His people, they called him
The Decembrist.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.163
Please. That's all I know.

05:29.360 --> 05:34.082
You killed my friends. You destroyed
my life once. Isn't that enough?

05:42.800 --> 05:47.203
At some point I may call,
ask for your assistance.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.927
- About what?
- The Decembrist.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.691
We can't let him walk out of here.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.840
We agreed when this was over,
I'd arrest him.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.320
That was four months ago.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.642
If you turn him in now,
we'll both go to jail.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.121
- I am not a murderer.
- Neither am I.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.766
Look, you don't have
to be the one to do it.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.566
There are people.
But he can't walk out of here alive.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.925
Close that door. Keep him quiet.

06:33.840 --> 06:34.887
Whoa, whoa.

06:35.080 --> 06:39.244
- Easy! Harbor master. Put the gun down.
- I'm gonna need to see some kind of ID.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.968
We got a call, reports
that someone's trespassing.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.766
Yeah. That's why I'm here. FBI.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.406
We're searching for two fugitives
escaped last night.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.285
Cleared the boat but they're said
to be in the area and armed.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.811
My office wasn't contacted.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.367
Bureau would have reached out.
Homelands running point.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.490
If you do see anything...

07:02.680 --> 07:04.728
- Be careful.
- Yeah, you too.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.091
Dembe. Where is he?

07:11.680 --> 07:13.330
You're working with Berlin?

07:13.520 --> 07:18.162
I need to talk to you about a bombing
in the Soviet Union, Kursk, 1991.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.127
- Fella won't talk!
- Keep pushing him.

07:24.320 --> 07:29.281
I'm telling you, he's more scared
of talking than he is of dying!

07:29.480 --> 07:33.166
- Keep pushing.
- I'm gonna need lunch!

07:33.360 --> 07:36.284
Tuna on rye!
Coleslaw if they have it!

07:39.120 --> 07:42.283
- What the hell is going on?
- We're shaking a few trees.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.124
There's been a development.

07:44.320 --> 07:48.291
It seems Berlin is merely a pawn
who's been tragically manipulated.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.768
- Manipulated by who?
- That's what Brimley's trying to ascertain.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.803
Berlin killed Meera,
he put Tom in my life.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.571
Every time you have a chance
to stop him, you let him go.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.888
Berlin will be held accountable
for his actions...

07:59.120 --> 08:02.090
...after I acquire the name of the man
who set him against me...

08:02.280 --> 08:05.204
...a man they call the Decembrist.

08:05.400 --> 08:09.007
If you want to find the one ultimately
responsible for gutting Harold Cooper...

08:09.200 --> 08:13.285
...and killing Meera Malik,
I suggest you help me find him.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.324
The man we're looking for
is known as the Decembrist.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.643
His acts contributed to the end
of communism in Eastern Europe.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.320
- How's he connected to Berlin?
- Tried to assassinate him...

08:26.560 --> 08:28.961
...during a meeting
and faked his daughter's death.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.527
Berlin's been hunting Reddington,
hunting us.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.609
Reddington wants to help Berlin
get revenge?

08:33.799 --> 08:37.361
That bombing, the men who were killed
were leaders of the Soviet Old Guard.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.847
Think we should be helping
these two settle scores?

08:40.080 --> 08:41.650
Our goal is to take down Berlin.

08:41.840 --> 08:45.287
If that means solving a terrorism case
along the way, I'm fine with that.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.130
- I'll contact the FSB.
- They won't help.

08:47.320 --> 08:50.688
The bombing was considered an act
of patriotism, they never pursued it.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.809
Pull the Russian reports, crime-lab data.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.889
I want our own analysis.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.330
- They have the bomber's DNA?
- Yes.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.524
The Russian crime lab reported
finding epithelial cells...

09:14.720 --> 09:17.007
...on the lip of a coffee tin
found in the debris.

09:17.240 --> 09:20.449
How do you know it was the bomber's
DNA? Didn't anyone else like coffee?

09:20.640 --> 09:22.927
The reports ID'd the explosive device
as Semtex...

09:23.160 --> 09:26.289
...same explosives a bomber
used to down Pan Am 103...

09:26.480 --> 09:30.326
...by hiding the explosives...
- In a coffee tin. Our guy copied that?

09:30.520 --> 09:32.249
- They have a name?
- Only a DNA profile...

09:32.440 --> 09:36.001
...which was useless 20 years ago before
they had a database to run it against.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.931
- But today...
- You found the Decembrist.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.803
Kiryl Morozov.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.321
Twenty years ago,
he was a low-level KGB operative.

09:45.560 --> 09:49.406
- And today?
- One of the most powerful men in Russia.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.204
Hey!

09:52.680 --> 09:54.409
Someone there?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.409
Okay.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.930
Oh, thank God.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.685
Please.

10:18.240 --> 10:21.449
Kiryl Morozov is one
of Putin's most trusted advisers.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.125
The man runs the Finance Ministry.

10:23.320 --> 10:26.324
And we have reason to believe
he's responsible for the 1991 bombing...

10:26.560 --> 10:30.201
...in Kursk that left...
- Twelve people dead. In Russia.

10:30.440 --> 10:33.762
FBI investigates crimes that happen
in America or against Americans.

10:33.960 --> 10:37.601
Reddington won't give us Berlin
until we give him Morozov.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.564
At the least,
we should question the man.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.205
I'm not sending you to Moscow...

10:41.400 --> 10:43.641
...to interrogate a high-ranking
Russian official...

10:43.840 --> 10:47.287
...about an act of terror he may or may
not have committed 25 years ago.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.209
If Reddington gets to Morozov first...

10:49.400 --> 10:51.971
Harold, that's an order.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.962
That's it?
You're just gonna stand down on this?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.527
You heard her. My hands are tied.

11:02.760 --> 11:06.685
But Reddington has anonymous sources.
I'm sure he'll get that name somehow.

11:06.880 --> 11:11.920
- Won't he, Agent Keen?
- Yes, sir. I'm sure he will.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.560
Tell me you have a name.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.843
I do, but this can't come back
on the task force. Are we clear?

11:24.280 --> 11:26.089
Hold on. I'll be right back.

11:26.280 --> 11:28.851
- What? Everything okay?
- No, everything's not okay.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.127
We got a situation here.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.361
- I'm sorry. I got to go.
- Lizzy, what's going on?

11:33.560 --> 11:38.168
The Decembrist,
his real name is Kiryl Morozov.

11:38.360 --> 11:42.285
- Something's wrong.
- Kiryl Morozov.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.801
- I got a name.
- So it's done?

11:54.080 --> 11:56.731
- No.
- What are you proposing?

11:56.920 --> 11:58.524
A trip to Moscow.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.929
- Went out for a smoke, he was here.
- What the hell?

12:18.240 --> 12:19.969
- Homeboy had a gun.
- Are you out of your mind?

12:20.160 --> 12:22.128
- It was him or me.
- He's got blood on him.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.402
- How are we supposed...
- If he doesn't answer...

12:24.600 --> 12:27.410
...someone is gonna come
looking for him.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.851
Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna let him go.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.160
- We'll move Tom.
- Let him go? He's gonna talk.

12:34.240 --> 12:37.084
So let him talk. He says anything,
it's his word against mine.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.280
- And he's an informant.
- Look, lady.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.085
This is obviously official business.
I can look the other way.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.209
- You got to kill him.
- No, please! Listen.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.721
Look, if you let this guy go,
he's going to the cops.

12:46.920 --> 12:50.561
When he does, we are all going to jail,
starting with you...

12:51.040 --> 12:53.327
...for torture, kidnapping,
wrongful imprisonment...

12:53.520 --> 12:55.966
...take your pick, sweetheart.

12:56.880 --> 12:57.961
You got to kill him.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.564
No. I can fix this.
I have a storage unit.

13:03.800 --> 13:06.201
We'll wait till dark.
We'll keep him here temporarily...

13:06.400 --> 13:08.528
...until we can find ano... No!

13:08.720 --> 13:10.440
It's better this way. Let him do it.

13:10.480 --> 13:12.050
Get off me! Get your hands off me!

13:15.000 --> 13:18.288
Tom, no! Tom, stop!

13:20.040 --> 13:22.964
- Aah!
- Next one goes in your chest.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.966
Tom, let him go!

13:36.360 --> 13:38.408
I think maybe you should call
Mr. Kaplan.

13:49.920 --> 13:52.241
Vadim. Mercury City Tower.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.683
Kiryl Morozov
is paranoid and well protected.

13:55.880 --> 14:00.522
He has no clear weakness for women
or drink. However, like any politician...

14:00.720 --> 14:05.408
...he does have an unending need
to hide his ill-gotten gains.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.647
The diamonds.

14:06.840 --> 14:10.731
Which he buys and sells through your
broker at Mercury City Tower in Moscow.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.322
There was a friendly and rather
convenient diamond heist this morning.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.443
When Morozov learns
the broker's been hit...

14:16.640 --> 14:19.120
...he'll insist on a meeting
to assess his exposure.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.243
When he does, we'll be there waiting.

14:21.880 --> 14:24.167
Milos, focus.

14:24.360 --> 14:30.527
I've made Morozov millions and
he's the one who set all this in motion?

14:30.760 --> 14:32.808
The meeting at Mercury Tower,
when it happens...

14:33.000 --> 14:35.890
...it'll happen fast before
the MUR arrives.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.124
My people will be ready.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.843
Who are you? What do you want?

15:00.080 --> 15:02.003
I am retribution.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.240
I don't know what you're talking about.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.725
Kursk.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.761
- Milos?
- The bombing, my daughter...

15:10.960 --> 15:14.407
...all of it brings us here.
- I did what I was told. Aah.

15:14.600 --> 15:18.764
- You're not the Decembrist.
- It was the American. It was him.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.523
- They gave the order.
- What people?

15:24.720 --> 15:25.926
I can't say.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.688
Who is the Decembrist?

15:33.520 --> 15:34.601
Fitch.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.687
His name is Alan Fitch.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.804
- Milos, this you cannot do.
- Give me one reason.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.281
- Because he's mine.
- Yours? He gave the orders...

15:47.480 --> 15:49.687
...discredited you
and you want to protect him?

15:49.920 --> 15:53.003
- This is not for you to do.
- But I will.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.290
Alan Fitch is dead.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.130
Call the florist.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.602
The joint chiefs want
another forward base.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.201
That will only happen
if we can convince Islamabad.

16:04.440 --> 16:09.287
Which is unlikely. it will happen if we
tether it to foreign military investment.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.767
Alan?

16:11.960 --> 16:14.042
Sir, will you make the call?

16:23.360 --> 16:25.522
A little early in the day,
don't you think, Ray?

16:25.720 --> 16:28.121
I'm still on Moscow time.

16:29.280 --> 16:34.127
Just got back from calling on
an old friend of yours, Kiryl Morozov.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.290
You met with
the Russian finance minister?

16:37.480 --> 16:42.327
- To what end?
- To his end as it turned out. Drink?

16:42.560 --> 16:45.609
The finance minister of Russia is dead.

16:45.800 --> 16:50.010
If a single word of this gets out,
if anyone suspects we sanctioned it...

16:50.200 --> 16:52.089
- I didn't sanction anything.
- Damn it.

16:52.320 --> 16:55.085
Your team discovers Morozov
was behind the Kursk bombing...

16:55.320 --> 16:58.290
...and 18 hours later, he's dead?
Reddington is behind this.

16:58.480 --> 17:01.563
Reddington called an hour ago.
He believes Fitch's life is in danger.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.842
Did Reddington bother to tell you...

17:04.079 --> 17:07.721
...why Berlin is suddenly interested
in killing Alan Fitch?

17:07.960 --> 17:11.009
He believes he's the one
who orchestrated the Kursk bombing.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.965
Are you accusing the assistant
director of National Intelligence...

17:15.160 --> 17:17.321
...of being a terrorist?
- We need to bring him in.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.409
Alan Fitch is not your concern.

17:19.640 --> 17:25.249
I'll contact the secretary of Homeland
Security and have the situation handled.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.560
- Ray, will you listen?
- We had an agreement.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.290
- Yes.
- I don't go after you...

17:29.520 --> 17:32.842
...you don't come after me.
- I know the terms, Ray.

17:33.040 --> 17:37.682
- But Berlin predates it.
- You ordered the bombing in Kursk.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.530
Then you pinned it on me.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.405
You blamed me for killing his daughter.

17:42.600 --> 17:47.970
Some years ago, a copy of this photo was
left on the corpse of an associate of mine.

17:48.160 --> 17:52.085
Taking it as a warning, I traced the girl
to a man they call the Stewmaker.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.681
He told me a story about the girl.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.730
She was sent to him by a man
she'd never met.

17:57.920 --> 18:00.082
She was in trouble,
needed to disappear...

18:00.280 --> 18:04.205
...so he took her photo, put it in a locket
and sent it to her father.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.290
All those years spent searching
for the man...

18:07.520 --> 18:11.081
...who supposedly murdered
his daughter, and it was you.

18:11.280 --> 18:14.090
You sat here in this very room...

18:14.320 --> 18:20.521
...and pretended you had no idea who
Berlin was or why he was coming for me.

18:20.720 --> 18:24.930
He was coming, Alan,
because you sent him.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.647
I sent a lot of guys.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.366
You and I were not on
the best of terms at the time.

18:31.720 --> 18:35.202
And since you're playing the innocent
victim in all this, let me remind you...

18:35.400 --> 18:38.165
...you stole some very damaging
information about us...

18:38.360 --> 18:40.044
...when you disappeared.

18:40.240 --> 18:43.767
- You violated our agreement.
- No.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.041
I honored it.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.528
I got the others to hold off
but Milos Kirchhoff...

18:48.720 --> 18:51.724
...Berlin,
whatever the hell name he's using...

18:51.920 --> 18:54.082
...he chewed through the leash.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.526
I couldn't stop him.

18:56.280 --> 18:59.568
Well, now your dog is tracking
a new scent, yours.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.161
And there's nothing
I can do about that, Alan.

19:02.360 --> 19:06.365
I have my people looking for him
but Berlin has gone into the wind.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.881
And he's coming for you.

19:10.840 --> 19:13.411
You have no allies in my group.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.284
Without me to protect you...

19:15.480 --> 19:19.246
...they'll take you down and they'll
let the chips fall where they may.

19:20.080 --> 19:24.005
So this is as much your problem
as it is mine.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.563
ODNI has credible intel that
there might be an attempt on your life.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.728
- What did they say?
- Still waiting to hear.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.367
They want to move you to Fort McNair
to do a full briefing.

19:35.560 --> 19:39.724
Deputy Fitch, Homeland Security.
We need you to come with us.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.121
Guardian's en route.
Delivery on schedule.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.048
Our office has notified the university.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.646
We have the package.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.724
Contact the D.C. field office.

20:10.920 --> 20:14.163
Get me an update on any eyewitnesses,
satellite footage.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.846
Alan Fitch's abduction
must be on Mossad's radar.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.647
Reach out to your people in Tel Aviv.
And you, talk to him.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.484
Elizabeth, we need to talk. Now.

20:34.840 --> 20:35.921
Tom.

20:37.320 --> 20:42.087
- What?
- You told me Torn is dead. He's not.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.042
Who told you he's alive?

20:46.560 --> 20:51.248
I'm disappointed you haven't felt that you
could trust me enough to tell me this.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.606
Look, okay, I lied.
But I only kept it a secret...

20:58.760 --> 21:00.200
...because I know you want him dead.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.324
You kept it a secret because
you didn't want to admit to yourself...

21:03.520 --> 21:05.010
...that you still love him...

21:05.240 --> 21:07.083
...that even after everything
he has done...

21:07.320 --> 21:10.688
...after how horribly he treated you,
you still can't let him go.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.645
So you're playing house.

21:13.840 --> 21:17.447
I've been using him as a source
and he's been incredibly valuable.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.649
Normally, any intelligence you could
gather from Tom Keen...

21:23.880 --> 21:25.245
...would be yesterday's news...

21:25.440 --> 21:28.922
...but Berlin has gone to ground and
is likely dependent on former assets...

21:29.120 --> 21:31.566
...he used when your husband
was in his employ.

21:31.760 --> 21:36.004
So it seems Tom may
be of some value after all.

21:36.200 --> 21:40.285
I need to know everything he can tell
you about Berlin's former safe houses...

21:40.520 --> 21:42.204
...former contacts.

21:42.440 --> 21:46.081
All that matters is finding Alan Fitch.

21:52.920 --> 21:56.003
- This ends now.
- I already gave you Berlin.

21:56.200 --> 21:59.010
- I told you where to find him.
- Yes, and he disappeared.

21:59.200 --> 22:02.682
- I did everything I could from in here.
- Forget it.

22:02.920 --> 22:05.160
- I already told you...
- And I told you it's the only way.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.244
Take a look, Liz.
This is a problem.

22:09.440 --> 22:14.128
- And time is not on your side.
- I need information, not advice.

22:14.320 --> 22:16.607
We both know
that you are in over your head.

22:16.800 --> 22:20.168
You are not equipped for this, Liz,
because you are not a killer.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.971
It's why I'm still alive
and you've got a corpse there...

22:23.160 --> 22:26.562
...that you have done nothing with.
And your bodyguard...

22:26.760 --> 22:29.764
...the one that you shot,
where do you think he is right now?

22:29.960 --> 22:31.530
He's getting a gun so he can...

22:31.720 --> 22:33.722
...kill me and
then probably kill you too.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.763
Now, I told you
there is a way out of this.

22:36.000 --> 22:42.451
I can give you Berlin
and all you have to do is let me go.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.564
Gosh, he's a popular guy.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.568
I bet somebody's gonna miss him.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.450
Berlin.

22:58.560 --> 23:01.131
- Orenburg six.
- Scorpio.

23:01.320 --> 23:05.041
- That function is no longer valid.
- Wait, wait, listen.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.766
Tell him Tom Keen wants to talk.

23:08.480 --> 23:12.690
Liz, why would you do this?
I mean, you're risking everything.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.120
To find Berlin.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.400
You're a federal agent
harboring a fugitive.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.649
I mean, worse than that,
you're keeping him captive.

23:19.840 --> 23:22.286
Five hundred cops
are out looking for Fitch right now...

23:22.480 --> 23:25.290
...and we're gonna find him
because of this.

23:29.880 --> 23:31.530
I thought you were dead.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.206
- I need you to bring me in.
- No.

23:34.400 --> 23:38.246
- Listen to me. I can help you.
- Well, time has passed.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.568
- Plans have changed.
- I know you have Fitch.

23:40.760 --> 23:42.842
I know everything they know
about your operation.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.884
You're gonna want to hear it
but I'm not telling you anything...

23:46.080 --> 23:47.730
...until you bring me in.

23:49.800 --> 23:53.043
Whether he leads us to Fitch or not,
I got to take him in.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.851
Are you hearing me?
You had to know when you told me...

23:56.080 --> 23:58.765
...that this is where it was gonna go.

23:58.960 --> 24:03.045
- Liz, I can't be part of this.
- He's an informant like Reddington.

24:03.240 --> 24:07.325
The difference is you're not in love
with Reddington.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.569
- I got an address.
- Where?

24:12.800 --> 24:14.928
Where? What difference
does it make where?

24:15.120 --> 24:18.408
What? You're gonna follow his lead to
someplace he says Berlin is hiding?

24:18.640 --> 24:21.928
- No. There could be 50 guys waiting.
- That's stupid.

24:22.120 --> 24:25.841
- Hey, shut up. I wasn't asking you.
- You want Berlin or not?

24:26.040 --> 24:29.089
No way I'm gonna let you go in there.
This is a setup, an ambush.

24:29.720 --> 24:30.960
What are you, her boyfriend?

24:32.920 --> 24:34.843
Hey!

24:35.800 --> 24:37.450
What address?

24:52.440 --> 24:56.126
3952 Spalding Street, Apartment 24.

24:56.320 --> 25:01.451
- Hey, pal. I'm coming for you.
- Good luck with that.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.285
Down!

25:19.240 --> 25:20.765
Target's neutralized.

25:20.960 --> 25:25.124
- I think we have a problem.
- Clear it out. Let's go. Clear out.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.760
Looks like we're dealing
with a plastic explosive, C4...

25:54.840 --> 25:56.046
“approximately 2 kilos.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.521
Sir, the blasting cap's
wired to a receiver.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.848
- We found our detonator.
- Can be detonated remotely.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.445
We need to jam the frequencies...

26:02.640 --> 26:05.803
...in case this nutjob tries to set it off.
- Then you're gonna disarm it?

26:06.040 --> 26:07.849
We have a vehicle
for controlled detonation.

26:08.080 --> 26:10.162
Should be big enough
for Fitch and one of my men.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.648
Once he's contained, we can attempt
to disassemble and disarm the device.

26:13.880 --> 26:15.450
How long will that thing take to get here?

26:15.600 --> 26:16.720
Half-hour minimum...

26:16.840 --> 26:20.287
...unless you've got another
R.F.-resistant armored box that fits two.

26:20.480 --> 26:23.563
Actually, I think it fits four.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.920
We managed to gain access
to the internals...

27:01.040 --> 27:03.850
...trying to circumvent the keypad.
Here's what we got so far.

27:04.040 --> 27:07.123
The Semtex runs along the circumference
of the collar, as you can see.

27:07.320 --> 27:10.244
Encased within that, approximately
14 inches of solid core wire...

27:10.480 --> 27:12.164
...connected to a microprocessor
which...

27:12.400 --> 27:14.607
- ...creates a closed circuit.
- Cut the collar off...

27:14.800 --> 27:16.768
...you interrupt the circuit and bang?

27:17.800 --> 27:20.201
- Then how do we disable it?
- Cautiously.

27:20.400 --> 27:23.006
We need to chip through the Semtex
to see what's underneath...

27:23.240 --> 27:25.322
...make sure there aren't
any redundant circuits.

27:25.520 --> 27:28.205
And you can do that
without triggering that thing?

27:28.400 --> 27:30.084
We'll find out, won't we?

27:31.560 --> 27:34.245
Look, I know I disobeyed a direct...

27:34.400 --> 27:36.482
You found him. That's all that matters.

27:36.680 --> 27:38.808
- Fill me in.
- We got played, Keen.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.889
I mean, look at it. Berlin's gone.

27:41.080 --> 27:42.730
- Tom's free.
- He brought us Fitch.

27:42.920 --> 27:47.050
Berlin handed us Fitch on a silver platter
after he had a bomb strapped to his neck.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.491
Look, I've been thinking about
what I said in the car and...

27:52.680 --> 27:55.923
Don't worry about it, Ressler.
I'll tell Cooper.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.651
I understand you're responsible
for finding Fitch.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.850
- About the source...
- Yeah.

28:07.080 --> 28:11.165
- Does he have information about Berlin?
- Yes, we believe he does.

28:11.360 --> 28:15.445
I don't care if your source is confidential
or what promises you've made him.

28:15.640 --> 28:20.601
I want him here, I want him interrogated
and I want his name.

28:21.360 --> 28:24.284
- You must be kidding.
- Do I sound like I'm kidding?

28:25.560 --> 28:29.690
It's Reddington.
Her source is Reddington.

28:36.920 --> 28:39.366
Please excuse my intrusion.

28:40.720 --> 28:44.088
I'm curious. Your father,
I assume he's been trying to reach you.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.560
Has he called?

28:49.800 --> 28:51.723
I thought as much.

29:10.400 --> 29:13.324
Sir, the device has a secondary
detonator built in as a safeguard.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.483
- What kind of safeguard?
- A timer.

29:15.680 --> 29:18.286
Think it was activated
when the receiver broke radio contact.

29:18.520 --> 29:19.806
- How long do you have?
- Unclear.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.685
We see the timing circuit
but no display. Could be a minute...

29:22.880 --> 29:24.120
...it could be an hour.

29:33.720 --> 29:36.121
- You're not hungry?
- It's fine.

29:36.320 --> 29:40.405
Let's get you something else. Huh?
Whatever you like.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.931
- I can tell them to go.
- No. I'm the one who should go.

29:47.120 --> 29:50.442
No, no.
They make you uncomfortable.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.045
I'm glad you called.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.003
You're scared.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.165
I am too.

30:10.520 --> 30:13.967
I don't know how to talk to someone...

30:15.160 --> 30:16.491
...like you.

30:18.440 --> 30:21.967
- I really should go.
- No. Please don't.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.606
I know you have your life.

30:25.080 --> 30:28.607
I have no place there. I know.

30:28.840 --> 30:33.846
But I just want you to stay
a little longer.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.488
Hello, Milos.

30:48.200 --> 30:52.410
Thank you, my dear. Passports,
tickets and my eternal gratitude.

31:04.120 --> 31:07.442
The bomb.
I need to know how to stop the bomb.

31:08.520 --> 31:11.410
- I don't know.
- That's the wrong answer.

31:12.640 --> 31:13.971
I'm telling you, I don't...

31:16.000 --> 31:17.843
Think harder.

31:23.760 --> 31:26.366
- What's your name, son?
- What?

31:26.560 --> 31:28.801
Your name. What is it?

31:29.640 --> 31:32.610
Sir, I need to be as still as possible.

31:32.960 --> 31:36.851
Any movement,
the vibrations of your voice...

31:38.600 --> 31:40.443
You have a wife?

31:41.560 --> 31:44.848
Kids?
That's what makes it the hardest...

31:45.040 --> 31:46.644
...a wife and kids.

31:48.160 --> 31:50.811
I've been in the intelligence field
a long time now.

31:51.000 --> 31:56.450
On my orders,
763 men and women have died...

31:57.160 --> 31:59.447
...in service to their country.

31:59.680 --> 32:03.048
And there wasn't a grieving wife
or mother or husband...

32:03.240 --> 32:06.881
...I didn't either call
or visit personally.

32:07.640 --> 32:10.928
Thank them for their sacrifice.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.647
That's what makes it the hardest,
the families.

32:16.120 --> 32:18.282
You can't disarm it, can you?

32:19.560 --> 32:22.291
Sir, I asked you to be
as still as possible.

32:22.840 --> 32:25.650
Seven hundred and sixty-three.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.921
That's more than enough.

32:31.560 --> 32:35.007
I'm not gonna make it 764.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.164
What's your name?

32:39.040 --> 32:42.203
Mike. My name's Mike.

32:42.400 --> 32:44.482
Go home, Mike.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.202
You've done everything you can.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.450
Harold, I know you're listening.

33:17.680 --> 33:19.648
Tell Ray I need to see him.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.209
What a long, strange trip it's been,
Alan.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.562
Listen to me, Ray.

33:58.800 --> 34:02.850
I don't know how much time we have,
so you need to pay attention.

34:03.040 --> 34:04.849
I've been able to hold everyone off...

34:05.040 --> 34:09.409
...convince them that it's
in their best interests to let you live.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.967
But people aren't as scared
as they once were.

34:12.159 --> 34:14.481
Some aren't so sure you even have it.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.487
Do you have it, Ray?

34:17.800 --> 34:19.324
Do you have the fulcrum?

34:23.239 --> 34:25.049
They're gonna demand proof.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.606
I can't stop this thing, Alan.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.004
I tried.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.089
I can't.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.489
My death will trigger a series of events.

34:36.719 --> 34:38.768
The moderates
were already outnumbered.

34:38.960 --> 34:42.760
The closer we get to 2017,
the more radicalized they'll become.

34:42.960 --> 34:45.645
Talk to Mitchum and Hobbs.

34:45.840 --> 34:48.446
They might be persuaded.

34:48.639 --> 34:51.166
Jasper sides with the Chinese.

34:53.080 --> 34:55.128
Listen to me, Ray. This is critical.

34:55.360 --> 34:58.091
I have a safe. Get to it.

34:58.320 --> 35:04.680
The combination, 8-30-44.

35:04.880 --> 35:07.884
- Remember that. Say it back.
- 8-30-44.

35:08.120 --> 35:10.361
8-30-44.

35:14.440 --> 35:16.807
Margaret's birthday.

35:17.960 --> 35:20.725
You've had a wonderful life together,
Alan.

35:21.640 --> 35:25.167
Fifty-one years last month.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.728
The safe.

35:31.320 --> 35:33.288
Yeah, the safe.

35:34.880 --> 35:39.090
It's at St. Petersburg in the wall
on the second floor of...

35:59.680 --> 36:01.489
Untie him.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.206
Thank you.

37:14.320 --> 37:19.531
I remember the parades
from when I was a young boy...

37:19.720 --> 37:22.690
...standing by my father...

37:22.920 --> 37:29.166
...seeing those trucks that went by
with the rockets and cannons.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.601
Beautiful. Ha-ha-ha.

37:34.560 --> 37:39.248
And all those men marching as one...

37:39.480 --> 37:43.121
...saluting at me as one.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.050
Our soldiers, our nation.

37:51.640 --> 37:55.326
Yuri Gagarin
was the first man in space.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.606
We were so proud.

39:09.040 --> 39:12.761
Your gentleman friend with the earring
said he moved the body.

39:15.080 --> 39:19.085
Mr. Kaplan is with him now.
We're trying to contain the situation.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.731
You should have come to me.

39:26.080 --> 39:28.560
- I didn't need to.
- Look around you, Lizzy.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.531
- We found Fitch because of Tom.
- It wasn't worth it.

39:31.760 --> 39:36.926
Not if the cost was you here in this...

39:39.000 --> 39:40.729
...filth.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.962
I couldn't do it.

39:47.160 --> 39:52.724
I told you I could kill Tom
but after you left, I just...

39:57.880 --> 40:00.804
After all the lies
and everything he did to me...

40:01.040 --> 40:07.605
...I told myself I was using him,
that I was finally in control.

40:12.480 --> 40:15.211
When you love someone,
you have no control.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.368
That's what love is...

40:18.960 --> 40:21.167
...being powerless.

40:22.240 --> 40:25.050
I don't know what's wrong with me.

40:27.080 --> 40:29.287
There's nothing wrong with you.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.281
There's nothing wrong with you.

You are never to see her again.

42:16.200 --> 42:20.205
You know, for what it's worth, I spent
four months on that ship chained up...

42:21.840 --> 42:24.241
...and I never told her about us.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.601
Not one word.
