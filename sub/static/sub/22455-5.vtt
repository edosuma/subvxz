MUSIC: Flagpole Sitta by Harvey Danger

00:02.717 --> 00:06.154
<i>I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

00:06.198 --> 00:09.190
<i>And I'm so hot</i>

00:09.238 --> 00:13.755
<i>Cos I'm in hell</i>

00:19.160 --> 00:23.234
Soph, just heard. The Shapiro Finance
presentation's been cancelled.

00:23.281 --> 00:26.592
- Rod's hypoglycaemic again.
- Oh, dear. Poor Rod.

00:26.642 --> 00:30.795
Yeah, terrible. On the bright side, free hour.

00:30.843 --> 00:33.437
Want to see if Marketing have left
any biscuits in Meeting Room B?

00:33.483 --> 00:39.037
Maybe. But I don't think it's a good
idea for us to hang out together.

00:39.085 --> 00:40.279
Oh?

00:40.325 --> 00:44.797
It's just... The thing is...
Jeff's asked... said, actually...

00:44.846 --> 00:49.921
He thinks you and I should see less
of each other. He's old-fashioned.

00:49.967 --> 00:54.086
Old-fashioned? What's next?
Put you in a chastity belt

00:54.128 --> 00:58.486
and make you... drive around
in an old-fashioned car?

00:58.529 --> 01:04.001
He's going to move in with me for
a couple of months, see if it helps.

01:04.050 --> 01:07.964
Moving in won't help.
Give him space. That might help.

01:08.011 --> 01:09.205
I'm really sorry, Mark.

01:10.491 --> 01:14.849
'I'm staring into the abyss.
I don't like the look of the abyss.'

01:14.892 --> 01:18.806
He's right here. It's switchboard.
Urgent call for you.

01:18.853 --> 01:19.603
Thanks.

01:19.653 --> 01:23.124
'Maybe I can fill the abyss
with lots of urgent calls.'

01:23.174 --> 01:25.291
- Hello.
- When are you getting back from work?

01:25.335 --> 01:29.328
6.30, like normal.
You said it was urgent, Jeremy.

01:29.375 --> 01:31.207
We're supposed to be flatmates.

01:31.256 --> 01:37.207
Nancy is in the States
and Super Hans is on the rig. I need a friend.

01:37.257 --> 01:40.967
Jez, just relax. Isn't Ready, Steady, Cook on?

01:41.018 --> 01:46.935
Just finished. Green peppers won, as
usual. It's Nuremberg all over again.

01:46.979 --> 01:52.054
There's some chocolate in the fridge
under the egg tray. See you tonight.

01:56.021 --> 01:57.818
'OK, going undercover.

01:57.861 --> 02:05.816
'Jeff's apparent mate, who would never try to nick
his bird from under his stupid old-fashioned nose.

02:05.863 --> 02:12.213
'Man chat topics: footballer Darren Anderton.
Figure of ridicule due to repeated injuries.

02:12.265 --> 02:19.377
'Turkish shepherd, ate his own testicles.
NB: Ignore tragic earthquake context.

02:19.426 --> 02:23.500
'Ferrari Testarossa, fast car.
Obviously no need to note that.

02:23.547 --> 02:27.666
'Shit, I'm making too many notes!
Just imbibe the culture.

02:27.708 --> 02:32.737
' Yes, civilisation is definitely doomed.'

02:32.789 --> 02:35.702
Hey. What's with all the mags?

02:35.750 --> 02:39.504
If you can't have sex with a monkey,
make friends with the organ grinder.

02:39.550 --> 02:43.430
Right. You didn't try
to have sex with a monkey?

02:43.471 --> 02:45.542
No. I'm going to the pub with Jeff.

02:45.592 --> 02:46.741
With Jeff?

02:46.792 --> 02:48.191
This is a special mission.

02:48.232 --> 02:51.305
Mark, I'm bored, dangerously bored.

02:51.353 --> 02:56.826
I considered doing that thing that that MP
and Michael Hutchence did. You know...

02:57.034 --> 03:02.905
Jez, don't do that. I won't be long.
Then we can talk about... stuff.

03:02.955 --> 03:06.426
I don't want to talk. I want to live.
I want to do things.

03:06.476 --> 03:07.352
What sort of things?

03:07.396 --> 03:12.835
Fun things, normal things. Archery,
badger-baiting. Whatever people do.

03:12.877 --> 03:14.869
I'll be as quick as I can.

03:14.918 --> 03:20.039
If you do that thing, don't do it in here -
the hook's practically out of the door.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.794
Why the sudden urge to join the pool league?

03:26.840 --> 03:27.990
I didn't even know you played.

03:28.041 --> 03:33.036
Oh, yeah. I play, all right.
Misspent youth. You know the score.

03:34.162 --> 03:35.072
Right.

03:35.122 --> 03:39.116
Plus I thought it would be good to hang out a bit.

03:39.163 --> 03:43.635
You're a bloke, I'm a bloke.
We're both bloody good blokes,

03:43.684 --> 03:49.635
unlike that Turkish shepherd who chewed off
his own knackers. Did you see that?

03:49.685 --> 03:51.438
No, I don't think so.

03:51.486 --> 03:54.364
Bloody shithead.

03:55.687 --> 03:59.475
Yes! Mark the shark is in business!

03:59.527 --> 04:00.358
You're stripes, Mark.

04:00.408 --> 04:05.005
Oh, yes. Right.
You play that, do you? Of course.

04:05.049 --> 04:10.204
So... FHM have only gone and done
a bloody sex issue. Did you see that?

04:10.250 --> 04:13.926
Loads of birds, foil bag, the whole caboodle.

04:13.971 --> 04:20.241
Carmen Electra's in there. I would seriously
love to really, really bang her.

04:20.291 --> 04:26.926
Although, if it was a choice between that or a drive
in a Ferrari Testarossa - phew, too close to call.

04:26.973 --> 04:29.966
You've given up trying to hump Soph?

04:30.014 --> 04:31.367
Pardon?

04:31.414 --> 04:35.124
- I said, you've given up trying to...
- Yes, I heard what you said.

04:35.175 --> 04:39.408
Well, let's be honest.
I suppose the best man won.

04:39.456 --> 04:40.650
Right.

04:42.537 --> 04:44.971
This is fun. Isn't it?

04:46.417 --> 04:48.613
- Hey, Marky Mark.
- Hey, Jez.

04:48.658 --> 04:54.370
Thanks for the call. This beats
being home in the same old trousers.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.488
That's Jeff's.

04:55.539 --> 04:58.008
- Jeff's?
- He's in the bog.

04:58.060 --> 05:04.136
It's going a bit terribly. But it's
important I make friends with him.

05:04.181 --> 05:06.935
So I thought you're more of a fun guy than me.

05:06.982 --> 05:09.371
So I'm the fluffer?

05:09.422 --> 05:13.701
No, it's not like that.
If I don't make friends with Jeff,

05:13.743 --> 05:18.499
there's a chance I'll never speak
to Sophie properly ever again.

05:18.544 --> 05:21.105
Oh, hi, Jeff. You remember Jeremy.

05:21.145 --> 05:24.695
Nice to see you, mate. Fantastic trainers.

05:24.746 --> 05:25.656
Cheers, mate.

05:25.706 --> 05:30.337
I got a pair. The straps go all
the way up, like a Roman sandal.

05:30.387 --> 05:34.142
So, what now?
A round of sambucas and hit a club,

05:34.188 --> 05:38.182
or just head back to ours or Sophie's?

05:38.229 --> 05:45.147
A mate just called. He has a poker school.
If you're interested in losing a bit of money, we could go.

05:45.230 --> 05:51.784
'Bonding with Jeff. I'm almost there, Soph.
Clear the runway. I'm coming in to land.'

05:51.831 --> 05:52.708
Mark.

05:52.752 --> 05:57.065
Right. Sorry. 'I think I've got a pretty good hand.

05:57.113 --> 06:02.313
'But there's always a chance someone
else might have a better one.

06:02.354 --> 06:05.187
'There's no way of knowing for sure.'

06:05.234 --> 06:07.544
I fold.

06:07.595 --> 06:10.906
'This is it.
I have entered the world of men.

06:10.956 --> 06:14.392
'All I need is some beef jerky
and somewhere to spit.

06:14.436 --> 06:16.792
'So, what have I got?

06:16.837 --> 06:19.874
'All the reds. That looks amazing.'

06:19.917 --> 06:22.796
I'm hot...

06:22.838 --> 06:25.433
like Pol Pot.

06:25.479 --> 06:27.071
Squeeze me.

06:27.119 --> 06:29.508
No. Too rich for my blood.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.235
I'll stay, friend.

06:33.280 --> 06:36.318
And I'll raise you...

06:37.721 --> 06:39.474
30.

06:39.522 --> 06:43.914
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll stay too... friend.

06:43.963 --> 06:49.880
And when the going gets tough,
you need to roll out the big potatoes.

06:49.924 --> 06:51.516
May I?

06:51.564 --> 06:53.283
Er... maybe.

06:53.325 --> 06:55.395
Let's eat.

06:57.000 --> 07:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:04.567 --> 07:05.795
I'm out.

07:05.847 --> 07:09.124
Red sky at night, shepherd's delight.

07:10.968 --> 07:13.244
Nice bluffing, lad!

07:13.289 --> 07:18.922
Yeah. 'Hey, I'm really good at this
without realising how. This is ideal.'

07:18.970 --> 07:25.080
So we're all gonna be great mates.
We could pile back to yours and Sophie's?

07:25.131 --> 07:30.206
Bit late for you. What do you play?
Seven-card stud? Texas Holdem?

07:30.252 --> 07:33.609
I just play the cards as they're dealt, my friend.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.610
Or stay here and play something else.

07:35.654 --> 07:37.451
Should we go for a drink?

07:37.494 --> 07:39.803
Yeah.

07:39.854 --> 07:44.930
'It's a relief. Tell me your dreams,
memories and reflections, Jeff.

07:44.976 --> 07:48.252
'What a surprise - you haven't got
any because you're a gristle-head.

07:48.296 --> 07:50.367
'Time to cut out the middleman.'

07:50.417 --> 07:52.726
- Hey, Soph.
- Oh, hey, Mark.

07:52.777 --> 07:57.056
I was talking to Alan
about Rod from Shapiro Finance.

07:57.098 --> 07:58.851
We should do something for him.

07:58.899 --> 08:00.298
Yeah.

08:00.339 --> 08:03.935
Yeah, for diabetes.
Give something back to a top JLB client

08:03.980 --> 08:08.611
and give a nasty, unglamorous illness
a kick in the pants at the same time.

08:08.661 --> 08:11.175
I said I'd talk to you about a sponsored something.

08:11.221 --> 08:13.611
Sure. We could, but...

08:13.662 --> 08:17.975
It is for charity,
but I could tell Alan you're not into it.

08:18.023 --> 08:21.618
No. Sure, we could do a sponsored something.

08:21.663 --> 08:23.859
I could do a sponsored run.

08:23.904 --> 08:30.344
You could do a sponsored history... thing.
Or dig. Or just reading.

08:30.385 --> 08:35.460
If we do something together,
it would capture people's imagination.

08:35.506 --> 08:39.500
Maybe... 'Maximum physical contact.
Potential horseplay.'

08:39.547 --> 08:40.535
Swimming?

08:40.587 --> 08:42.897
Mark, I don't think...

08:42.948 --> 08:45.018
Let's brainstorm later. Sorry, Soph.

08:45.068 --> 08:51.066
Jeremy, you can't just pop in
cos you're bored. I'll be home in an hour.

08:51.110 --> 08:53.226
Why don't you kill some time at Caesar's World?

08:53.270 --> 08:56.263
Actually, I've come to see Jeff.

08:56.311 --> 09:01.022
I appreciate what you're doing,
but the Jeff project's been abandoned.

09:01.072 --> 09:06.466
No, he asked if I fancied going
kickboxing and I thought, why not?

09:06.513 --> 09:08.629
You're going out with him for fun?

09:08.673 --> 09:11.711
Yeah. Jeff's a really good guy.

09:11.754 --> 09:14.872
He doesn't complain
that the music's too loud in bars

09:14.915 --> 09:20.115
or when it's his round and you ask him
for an extra bag of nuts. He's a real man.

09:21.476 --> 09:23.911
'Sponsored bungee.

09:23.957 --> 09:27.997
'Three days to organise, a lifetime
to look back on from our cottage in Dorset.'

09:28.038 --> 09:30.233
Alan's gonna be so pleased with us.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.836
Feel a bit safer strapped together?

09:31.878 --> 09:34.791
Yeah. Sorry about the big panic.

09:34.839 --> 09:38.196
'She bought it. "Ooh, I'm so scared."'

09:38.240 --> 09:40.754
I feel better doing a tandem jump.

09:40.800 --> 09:45.795
'This is great. I think I prefer
this to sex. No responsibility.

09:45.841 --> 09:50.233
'I'm strapped on. If I get a bonk on,
I'll say it's a buckle.

09:50.282 --> 09:51.841
'Be too much to think about anyway,

09:51.883 --> 09:57.993
'what with falling towards the ground with
only a massive rubber band between me and...

09:58.044 --> 09:59.762
'What the fuck am I doing?!

09:59.804 --> 10:04.196
'All my normal sensible cowardice
has been overridden by stupid love! '

10:04.245 --> 10:06.077
- Oh, God.
- You all right, Mark?

10:06.126 --> 10:08.720
- Yes. No, I don't know.
- What's the matter?

10:08.766 --> 10:14.718
I think I'm actually very hungry.
Let's not jump and just have lunch.

10:14.768 --> 10:19.240
I'm genuinely really, really hungry,
too hungry to jump!

10:19.289 --> 10:20.642
Guys, you're on.

10:20.689 --> 10:23.726
Relax. I'll be with you all the way.

10:23.769 --> 10:25.886
I don't want to go. I need a sandwich.

10:25.930 --> 10:27.761
Looks like we got ourselves a Humpty.

10:27.810 --> 10:31.360
It's too late to back out. Stay calm.

10:31.411 --> 10:34.245
Humpty, cling on to your girlfriend.

10:34.292 --> 10:35.202
I'm not his girlfriend.

10:35.252 --> 10:36.480
Stop calling me Humpty!

10:36.532 --> 10:38.763
Come on, Mark.

10:38.813 --> 10:41.122
No, no! No! I'm hungry!

10:41.173 --> 10:44.928
- I'm too bloody hungry to jump!
- But we're here now.

10:44.974 --> 10:48.684
I'm starving! It's not fair.
You can't make a hungry man jump!

10:48.735 --> 10:49.884
Do I just undo it?

10:49.935 --> 10:53.611
No, you do not just undo that!

10:56.817 --> 11:00.093
Thanks so much. It all makes a difference.

11:00.137 --> 11:02.254
I don't think we should be doing this.

11:02.298 --> 11:03.697
Why not? Who loses?

11:03.738 --> 11:05.694
It feels dishonest.

11:05.738 --> 11:12.088
Wake up. You think no-one mimed at Live Aid?
The ends always justify the means.

11:12.140 --> 11:13.937
Doesn't it prick your conscience?

11:13.980 --> 11:18.850
It was a long way down. Most people
would be scared to even go up there.

11:18.901 --> 11:21.860
Most people wouldn't volunteer
for a charity bungee jump.

11:21.902 --> 11:24.700
There's no need to go sarcastic.

11:24.743 --> 11:29.294
I've got a plan. Trek the Andes.
I've got a mate and he did it.

11:29.343 --> 11:32.973
Two weeks in Peru
and we can stick it to arthritis.

11:33.024 --> 11:39.625
Listen. I know you're doing this
to spend time with me and I appreciate it.

11:39.666 --> 11:44.661
But there's Jeff. I don't think
we should see each other any more. Sorry, Mark.

11:45.187 --> 11:47.781
'I've entered the abyss.

11:47.827 --> 11:52.538
'I've bought a house in the abyss.
I'm getting my post forwarded to the abyss.'

11:54.189 --> 12:01.221
I'm off to five-a-side with Jeff. Can I take
a couple of Garfields as shinpa... Jesus Christ!

12:01.270 --> 12:05.389
Jez, don't worry. I'm not actually cutting myself.

12:05.431 --> 12:10.267
I just need to convince Sophie
I'm desperate and I need some evidence.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.031
That's why you're cutting yourself?

12:12.073 --> 12:16.032
I'm not actually cutting myself. It's for evidence.

12:16.073 --> 12:20.944
Blood is coming out of your arm.
For fuck's sake, stop it!

12:20.995 --> 12:25.227
Self-harm might be appealing.
She'll want to take care of me.

12:25.275 --> 12:26.834
Let me finish the S.

12:26.876 --> 12:31.712
There must be a better way to get to Sophie.
What about a poem?

12:31.757 --> 12:37.628
Brilliant. Get a cup,
we'll catch the blood, and I'll write her a poem.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.637
'OK, come on. You can do this.

12:42.679 --> 12:46.719
'Oh, shit. There he is.
Am I actually gonna do this?

12:46.760 --> 12:51.994
'I've done self-harm. Compared to that,
this is a walk in the park. Do it for Sophie.'

12:52.041 --> 12:53.714
How's it going, Jeff?

12:53.762 --> 12:56.071
Not bad. You?

12:56.122 --> 12:58.078
Not bad.

12:58.122 --> 13:00.079
Hey, look at that.

13:00.123 --> 13:04.879
Mike's arse. Quite a nice arse
he's got on him, wouldn't you say?

13:04.924 --> 13:10.238
- You what?
- I certainly wouldn't mind... giving him one.

13:10.285 --> 13:12.754
Are you trying to tell me you've gone gay?

13:12.806 --> 13:17.403
There's no need to spread it around.
But yes, those are the facts.

13:17.447 --> 13:20.325
Sexuality is a broad spectrum and...

13:20.367 --> 13:21.960
And you've moved into the gay bit.

13:22.008 --> 13:27.959
That's right. I have gone somewhat,
in fact almost entirely, gay.

13:28.009 --> 13:34.483
So... Colin from Human Resources -
would you... would you suck him off?

13:34.530 --> 13:37.329
Yeah, well, now I've gone gay,

13:37.371 --> 13:41.923
would it be all right if I came over
to see Sophie now and again?

13:41.972 --> 13:44.247
I don't know. Ask her. I'm not a prison warder.

13:44.292 --> 13:48.684
What? But she said... She said you'd said...

13:48.733 --> 13:50.372
It's fine by me.

13:50.414 --> 13:54.327
That's great, Jeff. Thanks a lot.

13:54.374 --> 13:56.730
No worries.

13:56.775 --> 14:00.974
Gay or not, there's no threat from you, pal.

14:02.096 --> 14:07.888
You could have your cock in her
and still not have the balls to fuck.

14:09.258 --> 14:10.816
See you later.

14:10.858 --> 14:13.133
Thanks.

14:13.178 --> 14:16.216
See you later, Jeff.

14:16.259 --> 14:18.933
'I'm experiencing humiliation.

14:18.980 --> 14:22.974
'Blood boiling, anger rising up, ready to explode...

14:23.021 --> 14:28.176
'Then falling back in on myself
in the familiar shower of self-loathing.

14:28.222 --> 14:33.297
'Mmm. Warm copies make everything better.'

14:35.423 --> 14:36.697
You sure this is OK?

14:36.744 --> 14:38.223
It's fine.

14:38.264 --> 14:39.663
All right, Jez.

14:39.704 --> 14:43.220
Hi. Thought I'd pop over, since that's cool.

14:43.265 --> 14:43.936
Mark.

14:43.985 --> 14:49.106
Soph, let's cook for these guys while
they're in the pub. I've got wine.

14:49.146 --> 14:51.103
I don't know.

14:51.147 --> 14:53.707
You were moaning about
getting left on your own again.

14:53.747 --> 14:56.706
Right. Well, you should come in.

14:56.748 --> 15:02.142
It's Ernest and Julio. Fictional,
obviously, but it gives a nice image.

15:03.829 --> 15:09.029
So basically, man is programmed
to do two things - kill and knob.

15:09.070 --> 15:11.585
In the Stone Age, you'd get up, kill an antelope...

15:11.631 --> 15:13.110
And knob the corpse.

15:13.151 --> 15:15.620
No, Jez.

15:16.792 --> 15:20.991
Aye-aye. A couple of high-street
honeys at three o'clock.

15:21.033 --> 15:28.110
'God, this is so butch! If I was with Mark we'd
just be sitting in the corner rating the alcopops.'

15:28.154 --> 15:30.794
Right. Mine's the blonde.

15:30.835 --> 15:35.352
What, really? What about Nancy? Or Sophie?

15:35.396 --> 15:40.312
Jez! We're not gonna do anything.
We're just going over.

15:48.679 --> 15:52.719
- How long is Das Boot, exactly?
- Four and half solid entertainment hours.

15:53.840 --> 15:57.550
Soph, I was talking to Jeff the other day

15:57.601 --> 16:01.959
and it seems he doesn't mind
me being round here at all.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.481
I don't want to go into that now.

16:03.522 --> 16:05.878
Right. It's just, you said...

16:05.923 --> 16:09.632
Yeah. I thought it would be simpler
for us to keep a distance.

16:09.683 --> 16:13.233
Right. Because of... feelings.

16:13.284 --> 16:15.879
No, not because of feelings. Just simplicity.

16:15.925 --> 16:17.802
Right.

16:19.205 --> 16:24.041
'Ha, got my emotional meathook in.
Now time to waggle it around.'

16:24.086 --> 16:28.797
I suppose I was kind of surprised
Jeff was cool about me coming over.

16:28.847 --> 16:32.238
I mean, you and I have a bit of history.

16:32.288 --> 16:33.801
Yeah. Well, history's history.

16:33.849 --> 16:36.647
But new volumes keep being published.

16:36.689 --> 16:38.920
'That's not a saucy metaphor.'

16:38.970 --> 16:41.530
I mean, I might try some of my moves.

16:41.570 --> 16:42.969
Yeah, right

16:43.010 --> 16:45.889
'My moves are nothing, are they? '

16:45.931 --> 16:51.484
You ought to be careful wearing tops
like that. I am a man, after all.

16:51.532 --> 16:55.162
- Oh, are they in a submarine?
- Yes, they're in a submarine.

16:55.213 --> 16:57.250
All right? Sorry I'm a bit late.

16:57.294 --> 16:59.569
Hi, Jeff.

16:59.614 --> 17:02.971
Come on, gorgeous. Let's get you to bed.

17:03.015 --> 17:04.414
Jeff, we're watching a film.

17:04.454 --> 17:07.367
Stupid video or comfy warm bed?

17:07.415 --> 17:09.372
It's nearly finished anyway, right?

17:09.415 --> 17:10.690
No, not really.

17:10.736 --> 17:13.968
It's been pretty good. Good night.

17:17.657 --> 17:20.776
Thanks for keeping her warm for us, mate.

17:20.819 --> 17:23.492
Sure. No problem.

17:23.539 --> 17:26.179
You can... let yourself out, yeah?

17:31.261 --> 17:35.301
'You're a bottler, Corrigan.
You couldn't bungee, you wouldn't lunge.

17:35.342 --> 17:40.019
'Maybe I'm too nice.
I should have tried, "Hey, baby, suck this."

17:40.063 --> 17:46.412
'No, it's not my style. Got to stick
to my own methods, my homespun charm.

17:46.464 --> 17:48.216
'Also, I'd never be able to carry it off.'

17:48.264 --> 17:49.664
Psst! Mark!

17:49.705 --> 17:50.615
Jeff.

17:50.665 --> 17:56.582
Got a mission for you. Need a few
rubber johnnies and I'm not dressed.

17:56.626 --> 18:00.415
You want me to... No, I don't think so, Jeff.

18:00.467 --> 18:02.537
Do you have a problem with that?

18:02.587 --> 18:08.459
Why would I have a problem?
I'm just a mate round seeing a couple of mates.

18:08.509 --> 18:11.069
'This is it. This is my lowest ever.

18:11.109 --> 18:16.947
'Wish I'd told him to fuck off
except then I'd never be allowed back.

18:16.991 --> 18:21.782
'Fetherlite. Don't want him
to enjoy it any more than necessary.

18:21.832 --> 18:28.227
'Ultra Strong. Yeah, he won't feel a thing.
But then maybe he'll last longer.

18:28.273 --> 18:34.543
'Oh, Jesus. This is a minefield. Serve him right
if I prick them all with pins and then...

18:34.594 --> 18:41.035
'Sophie got pregnant and he ended up...
getting married? Got to think through these plans.

18:41.076 --> 18:46.026
'I'll go for these. Coloured.
It'll make him look faintly ridiculous.

18:46.077 --> 18:49.274
'I win... in the most minor way possible.'

18:52.958 --> 18:55.996
I was gonna twat this geezer
and it turns out they're both Polish.

18:56.039 --> 18:58.473
"Twat a geezer"?

18:58.519 --> 19:01.751
Were you playing the Lock, Stock
And Two Smoking Barrels video game?

19:01.800 --> 19:05.953
It was brilliant. And then... I can't really tell you.

19:06.001 --> 19:09.074
Did Jeff fart in a pint?

19:09.122 --> 19:12.876
No, much better than that. But I can't tell you.

19:12.922 --> 19:14.561
Go on. You can tell me.

19:14.603 --> 19:16.753
No, I can't. I really can't.

19:18.044 --> 19:24.314
All right. If I tell you, you have to promise
not to tell anyone. On your mum's life.

19:24.365 --> 19:26.162
I promise on my mum's life.

19:26.205 --> 19:30.882
OK. Basically, Jeff... he... not really, but a bit...

19:30.926 --> 19:33.122
got off with this girl.

19:33.167 --> 19:34.566
He...

19:34.607 --> 19:37.361
Oh, my God!

19:37.408 --> 19:43.518
I've hit the mother lode! I've been waiting for this!
I can really fuck him with this!

19:43.569 --> 19:50.487
No. I only told you for a laugh. It's all
a great big laugh. You promised not to tell.

19:50.530 --> 19:54.410
Hitler promised not to invade Czechoslovakia.
Welcome to the real world.

19:54.451 --> 19:56.841
What about your mum's life?

19:56.892 --> 20:00.283
What about it? What are you gonna do, kill her?

20:00.333 --> 20:04.042
Please don't. Jeff's my mate. We've got a bond.

20:04.093 --> 20:08.087
Right. Who's your real best mate, me or Jeff?

20:08.134 --> 20:11.730
You don't have to ask that, Mark. That's obvious.

20:11.775 --> 20:19.047
'Didn't actually have to say.
Don't even have to decide in my own head.

20:19.097 --> 20:23.728
'No, I don't think I'm going to.
My brain can't make me. So there.'

20:27.858 --> 20:32.934
'Brilliant. This is brilliant. Oh, life is sweet! '

20:32.980 --> 20:35.733
- Hi, there, Soph.
- Hey, Mark.

20:35.780 --> 20:40.696
Soph, listen. I've been turning
this over and over in my head

20:40.741 --> 20:42.858
like a bloody horrible pancake.

20:42.902 --> 20:45.462
- I just don't know what to do.
- What about?

20:45.502 --> 20:50.452
There's something I need to tell you,
something I think I should tell you.

20:50.503 --> 20:52.859
But it's just so damn hard.

20:52.904 --> 20:55.418
Don't say anything you'll regret. I'm with Jeff now.

20:55.464 --> 21:00.984
That's the thing.
That's what this horrible decision relates to,

21:01.026 --> 21:05.623
something that Jeff's done that
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

21:05.667 --> 21:06.986
What are you talking about?

21:07.027 --> 21:11.863
Oh, no, now I've said too much.
Damn. Damn these lips of mine.

21:11.908 --> 21:14.706
Stop being weird and tell me what Jeff's done.

21:14.748 --> 21:18.628
It's not for me to tell tales on a mate.

21:18.669 --> 21:24.621
But just ask him, all right,
what happened in the pub by the fruit machine

21:24.671 --> 21:29.621
with a woman... and the lips.
I can't say anything else. I won't.

21:29.672 --> 21:34.383
'I hope I wasn't too subtle.
That definitely wasn't too subtle.'

21:35.633 --> 21:37.988
Has Jeff said anything about...

21:38.033 --> 21:40.707
I don't wish to converse with you.

21:40.754 --> 21:42.551
You're a promise-breaker and a tom-tailed tit.

21:45.555 --> 21:48.866
- Sophie!
- Hi, Mark. Can I come in?

21:48.916 --> 21:52.272
Of course. Soph, are you OK?

21:52.316 --> 21:54.512
Yeah, fine...

21:54.557 --> 21:57.436
I hate him, I hate him, I hate him!

21:57.478 --> 22:01.551
There, there, Soph. It's fine. It's OK. Come
through.

22:01.598 --> 22:03.476
Come through with good old Mark.

22:03.519 --> 22:07.911
'Her breast is just brushing my side there.'

22:07.960 --> 22:10.190
I shouldn't be here. I don't know what I'm doing.

22:10.240 --> 22:13.995
It's OK. I'll make us a nice cup of tea.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.761
It's my fault for always picking wankers!

22:16.802 --> 22:19.680
Does... Does he beat you, Soph?

22:19.722 --> 22:22.157
God, no. He broke a plate once but...

22:22.203 --> 22:25.116
Does he come at you with a stick?

22:25.164 --> 22:26.597
No, never. It's nothing like that.

22:26.644 --> 22:30.923
He does beat you mentally.
And with his hands and fists.

22:30.965 --> 22:31.681
No.

22:31.725 --> 22:35.116
- Hey, Soph. You OK?
- Yeah, just getting my head together.

22:36.566 --> 22:37.635
God, your head - is it OK?

22:37.686 --> 22:41.157
Oh, hi, Jeff. You're downstairs?

22:41.207 --> 22:43.437
Do I know where Soph is?

22:43.487 --> 22:46.480
Uh... No. No, mate. No idea.

22:46.528 --> 22:49.805
Right. OK.

22:49.849 --> 22:52.363
Sorry about that, mate. Bye.

22:53.530 --> 22:57.045
What... Why did you cough?

22:57.090 --> 22:58.524
Because I've got a cough.

22:58.571 --> 22:59.640
No, you haven't.

22:59.691 --> 23:02.764
Yeah, I have. I'm phlegmy.

23:02.812 --> 23:04.609
Bollocks! You gave him a signal!

23:04.652 --> 23:09.568
Jesus! Can't I have a cough without
being taken to Guantanamo Bay?

23:09.613 --> 23:12.811
Well, actually, I'm trying to have a conversation.

23:12.854 --> 23:14.253
It's all right, Mark.

23:14.294 --> 23:17.810
Sounds like your relationship was a prison

23:17.855 --> 23:22.646
with one innocent prisoner, you,
and one guard, Jeff.

23:22.696 --> 23:24.891
Well, it was a passionate relationship.

23:24.936 --> 23:26.529
That must be horrible.

23:28.617 --> 23:29.732
That's Jeff.

23:29.777 --> 23:32.850
How coincidental, Jeremy! How very coincidental!

23:32.898 --> 23:35.538
This could be a coincidence. Easily.

23:37.179 --> 23:38.214
Hello?

23:38.259 --> 23:41.093
You're not wanted here, Jeff! Get away from here.

23:41.140 --> 23:44.371
- Shouldn't we just? Him and Sophie...
- I need to see Soph!

23:44.420 --> 23:47.140
Get away from the door
or I will give you the broom!

23:47.181 --> 23:49.821
Mark, I need to see Sophie. >

23:49.862 --> 23:53.855
I'm gonna give you the broom, Jeff!
I'm gonna broom you!

23:53.902 --> 23:56.019
Don't worry, Soph. I'm giving him the broom.

23:56.063 --> 24:00.137
You can't broom him. He's my mate.
He's a solid gold mate.

24:00.184 --> 24:02.857
How did Soph find out about
that girl in the pub, Jez?

24:02.904 --> 24:04.816
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. >

24:04.865 --> 24:08.141
Just let me in, mate. Please, Jez.
I need to see Soph.

24:08.186 --> 24:12.657
We hate you! You're a cocksucker!
Jez told me about your fling.

24:12.706 --> 24:16.256
Your friendship's bullshit and you're a fuckhead!

24:16.307 --> 24:18.538
It isn't bullshit! Let him in! >

24:18.588 --> 24:20.544
Let me in, Jez, please!

24:20.588 --> 24:23.786
'Mark or Jeff? Jeff's normal.

24:23.829 --> 24:27.106
'I could make a new life. I could learn
to like football and learn his ways.

24:27.150 --> 24:31.906
'I'd be in the mainstream instead
of being a freak in our weird puddle.'

24:31.951 --> 24:34.988
Oh, fuck. I can't do it, Jeff. I can't do it.

24:35.031 --> 24:38.342
<i>Ha-ha! You lose, Jeff! You losel</i>

24:38.392 --> 24:41.351
How dangerous am I now, eh?!

24:41.393 --> 24:43.224
Let him in, Mark.

24:43.273 --> 24:49.509
Sophie, you don't need to do this.
There are places you can go. Women's refuges.

24:49.554 --> 24:52.547
Just open the door. We need to talk.

24:54.195 --> 24:57.427
Jeff, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean...

25:01.717 --> 25:06.508
Brilliant. My mate and your woman
have just gone to fuck each other.

25:06.558 --> 25:10.632
What are we gonna do? Go make a tent
in the living room and eat Dairylea?

25:10.679 --> 25:13.990
Is that what you want?
Cos that's what's gonna happen.

25:20.801 --> 25:22.359
<i>Paranoia, paranoia</i>

25:22.401 --> 25:25.314
<i>Everybody's coming to get me</i>

25:26.002 --> 25:28.597
<i>Just say you never met me</i>

25:29.043 --> 25:33.435
<i>I'm running underground
with the moles, digging holes.</i>
