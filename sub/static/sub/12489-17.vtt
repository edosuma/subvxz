WEBVTT

00:05.376 --> 00:07.538
OH, DEAR.
HEY, MOM.

00:07.538 --> 00:09.710
HONEY, YOU ALWAYS CHECK
THE FIRMNESS OF THE SIDEWALK

00:09.710 --> 00:11.582
BEFORE YOU STEP ON IT,
DON'T YOU?

00:11.582 --> 00:13.544
UH, NO. WHY?

00:13.544 --> 00:16.317
A JOGGER IN ENGLAND
FELL THROUGH UP TO
HER ARMPITS.

00:16.317 --> 00:19.220
SHE'S ALL RIGHT,
BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO BE
HAPPENING MORE AND MORE.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.122
FINE. NO SIDEWALKS.

00:21.122 --> 00:24.555
IS IT OKAY IF I MEET DUSTIN
TODAY-- IF I LEAP FROM
ROOF TO ROOF?

00:24.555 --> 00:27.698
WOW, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
SEEING EACH OTHER FOR A WHILE.

00:27.698 --> 00:31.362
SO SWEET. FRESH BLOOM
OF FLOWERING EMOTIONS.

00:31.362 --> 00:32.733
MOM, GROSS!
WHAT?

00:32.733 --> 00:34.665
THERE'S NOTHING GROSS
ABOUT LIKING A BOY.

00:34.665 --> 00:36.667
NO. YOU TALKING
ABOUT IT IS GROSS.

00:36.667 --> 00:40.211
FINE. I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS.

00:40.211 --> 00:42.573
WOULD IT BE GROSS IF I ASKED YOU
WHERE YOU'RE GOING?

00:42.573 --> 00:44.575
WELL, IT WASN'T
UNTIL YOU MADE YOUR

00:44.575 --> 00:46.577
"MY LITTLE GIRL
IS GROWING UP" FACE.

00:46.577 --> 00:49.080
BUT WE'RE GOING TO
A SPOKEN WORD POETRY SLAM

00:49.080 --> 00:51.722
AT THIS REALLY COOL PLACE
CALLED PLACE.

00:51.722 --> 00:54.585
I LOVE POETRY.
I RHYME ALL THE TIME.

00:54.585 --> 00:58.329
GOOD ONE, ELLEN.
HOW GOOD? THERE'S NO TELLIN'.

00:58.329 --> 01:01.692
I NEED GRAPES.
GRAPES WILL HELP.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH DAD?

01:01.692 --> 01:03.394
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S WRONG WITH DAD.

01:03.394 --> 01:05.366
DAD IS A LITTLE UPTIGHT
BECAUSE DAD HAS TO

01:05.366 --> 01:07.538
TURN IN HIS BOOK IN TWO DAYS
AND DAD ISN'T FINISHED.

01:07.538 --> 01:09.740
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH DAD.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH DAD?

01:09.740 --> 01:11.342
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S WRONG WITH DAD.

01:11.342 --> 01:12.573
DAD IS A LITTLE UPTIGHT
BECAUSE---

01:12.573 --> 01:14.205
YOUR FATHER HAS PUT OFF
FINISHING HIS BOOK

01:14.205 --> 01:15.606
UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE,
AND NOW HE'S STRESSING OUT.

01:15.606 --> 01:17.478
YOU PROCRASTINATED!

01:17.478 --> 01:20.111
IT'S PART OF
MY CREATIVE PROCESS.

01:20.111 --> 01:22.313
REALLY? YOU'VE BEEN
DRAWING HAND TURKEYS

01:22.313 --> 01:23.814
AND REPAIRING
THE HEELS ON YOUR SHOES.

01:23.814 --> 01:26.617
WHY PAY A COBBLER?
I HAVE THE TOOLS.

01:26.617 --> 01:29.760
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT I'D SET
A BETTER EXAMPLE FOR YOU,
BENNETT.

01:29.760 --> 01:33.194
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.
VERY DISAPPOINTED.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.126
IS EVERYBODY DONE?

01:35.126 --> 01:37.198
EVERYBODY BUT YOU.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.799
( all laugh )

01:38.799 --> 01:40.771
Stan: PROCRASTINATION
IS A FUNNY THING.

01:40.771 --> 01:42.503
AND I'LL TELL YOU
ALL ABOUT IT

01:42.503 --> 01:44.335
AS SOON AS I CHECK OUT
THIS WEBSITE THAT SHOWS

01:44.335 --> 01:46.207
WHAT I'D LOOK LIKE
WITH A NOSE JOB.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.479
HERE'S WHAT I'D LOOK LIKE
WITH GEORGE CLOONEY'S NOSE.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.582
HERE'S ME WITH A PIG NOSE.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.487
OH, THIS IS SUCH
A TIME-WASTER.

01:56.487 --> 01:58.449
OOH, WHAT WOULD I LOOK LIKE
WITH BIGGER EARS?

02:00.851 --> 02:03.324
♪♪

02:20.411 --> 02:23.474
BENNETT, YOU'VE BEEN
NURSING THAT SAME CUP OF COFFEE

02:23.474 --> 02:25.846
FOR HALF AN HOUR. IT'S TIME
TO GET BACK TO WORK.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.649
YOU'RE RIGHT. THIS IS JUST
THE KIND OF GENTLE PUSH

02:28.649 --> 02:31.382
THAT I NEED TO MOTIVATE MY--
OH, LOOK, AVERY'S BACK!

02:31.382 --> 02:32.553
TELL US EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOUR DATE,

02:32.553 --> 02:34.154
NO MATTER HOW MANY
HOURS IT TAKES.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.826
AH, IT WAS FINE.

02:35.826 --> 02:38.689
THE POETRY SLAM WAS GREAT,
DUSTIN AND I BROKE UP,

02:38.689 --> 02:40.331
THEN I HAD A PEACH,
NOW I'M HOME.

02:40.331 --> 02:42.493
WAAH. WHAT?
YOUR BROKE UP?

02:42.493 --> 02:44.335
WHAT HAPPENED?
ARE YOU OKAY?

02:44.335 --> 02:46.337
OH, YEAH. FINE.
TOTALLY FINE.

02:46.337 --> 02:47.868
IT WAS MUTUAL.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.501
WE HAD A FRIENDLY, THOUGH
SOMEWHAT DISPASSIONATE, HUG,

02:50.501 --> 02:52.573
THEN I HAD THE PEACH
I MENTIONED EARLIER,

02:52.573 --> 02:55.246
THEN I SIGNED UP TO DO
A SPOKEN WORD PIECE NEXT WEEK.

02:55.246 --> 02:57.378
I'VE ACTUALLY
ALREADY STARTED IT.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.909
IT'S ABOUT A GUY NAMED SAUL--

02:58.909 --> 03:01.352
SAUL GOOD.

03:01.352 --> 03:03.354
"TWO KIDS WHO MET IN SCHOOL."

03:03.354 --> 03:05.716
"AT FIRST, HE WAS
JUST MY ALGE-BRO

03:05.716 --> 03:09.420
"THEN IT WAS A LITTLE MO',
NOW IT'S NO MO'

03:09.420 --> 03:10.791
SAUL GOODE."

03:10.791 --> 03:14.525
I'M GONNA GO
WORK ON IT.

03:14.525 --> 03:17.498
WOW. SHE, UH, SHE REALLY
TOOK THAT BREAKUP WELL.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.969
THAT'S AVERY--
MY BRAVE SOLDIER.

03:18.969 --> 03:21.402
SHOULD YOU GO TALK TO HER?
NO. NO.

03:21.402 --> 03:24.475
I KNOW MY DAUGHTER.
SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT THE EMOTIONAL STUFF.

03:24.475 --> 03:27.408
EVERY TIME I'VE TRIED,
SHE'S PUSHED ME AWAY.
BUT SHE'S FINE.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.880
EVEN WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE,
SHE DIDN'T SHED A SINGLE TEAR

03:29.880 --> 03:31.642
WHEN HER PET LIZARD
GOT SUCKED INTO THE VACUUM.

03:31.642 --> 03:33.484
I MEAN, RAN AWAY.

03:36.547 --> 03:39.650
AND THAT'S WHY NO MATTER
HOW TEMPTING IT MIGHT SEEM,

03:39.650 --> 03:42.953
YOU SHOULD NEVER KISS A MONKEY.

03:42.953 --> 03:46.257
ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS
ABOUT WORKING AT THE FOOD TRUCK,
HAWK,

03:46.257 --> 03:49.730
IS HEARING ALL THE COOL STORIES
YOU TELL WHERE YOU ALMOST
LOSE A LIP.

03:49.730 --> 03:53.304
I AM NOTHING IF NOT
A CAUTIONARY TALE.

03:53.304 --> 03:55.406
LOOK AT ALL THIS GARBAGE
I FOUND UNDER THE TRUCK.

03:55.406 --> 03:56.967
BOTTLES, WRAPPERS,

03:56.967 --> 04:00.240
AND THESE TWO BLOCKS OF WOOD
SOME DOOFUS LEFT BEHIND
THE TIRES.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.714
YEEEAH, SEE,
THESE ARE WHEEL BLOCKS,
TALL BUDDY.

04:03.714 --> 04:06.847
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
I TRADED MY EMERGENCY BRAKE

04:06.847 --> 04:08.849
FOR A REALLY COOL COWBOY HAT.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.522
THESE KEEP THE TRUCK
FROM ROLLING AWAY,

04:11.522 --> 04:14.325
WHICH GIVES ME PEACE OF MIND,
SINCE I LIVE IN IT.

04:16.327 --> 04:18.529
( loud crash )

04:19.630 --> 04:22.333
SURE LOVE TO SEE
THAT COWBOY HAT.

04:25.336 --> 04:28.669
"HIS NAME WAS DUSTIN,
AND I WASN'T NONPLUSSED IN

04:28.669 --> 04:31.542
FACT; SAUL GOODE."

04:31.542 --> 04:35.275
IT'S YOUR FIRST BREAKUP.
YOU'RE SADDER THAN
YOU'RE LETTING ON.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.407
I CAN SMELL IT.

04:36.407 --> 04:39.049
YOU SMELL SADNESS?
OH, YEAH.

04:39.049 --> 04:40.681
DOGS SMELL FEAR, JOY,

04:40.681 --> 04:42.683
SADNESS-- BUTTS, OF COURSE.

04:43.854 --> 04:46.387
SAD SMELLS LIKE
A PUDDLE ON THE STREET

04:46.387 --> 04:48.789
WHERE'S THERE'S ALSO BEEN
A TINY PIECE OF SALAMI.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.462
WELL, YOUR SMELLER
NEEDS TO BE RECALIBRATED,

04:51.462 --> 04:53.524
BECAUSE I AM JUST FINE.

04:53.524 --> 04:57.067
I CAN COMFORT YOU.
I'M A DOG. IT'S MY THING!

04:57.067 --> 05:01.001
COME ON, PET ME.
IT'S WHY I USE CONDITIONER.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.373
IS THIS HELPING AT ALL?

05:02.373 --> 05:04.905
IF I GO ANY DEEPER
I'M GONNA GET A SNOUT CRAMP.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.640
OKAY, STAN,
CAN DOGS SMELL ANNOYED?

05:09.640 --> 05:11.542
BECAUSE YOU'RE STARTING
TO BUG ME.

05:11.542 --> 05:15.416
OH, YEAH. IT'S MUSTARD WITH
A LITTLE BIT OF DIRTY BALLOON.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.719
STAN, PLEASE.
I'M TRYING TO WORK ON MY POEM.

05:21.852 --> 05:23.454
Stan:
I KNOW SHE'S SAD.

05:23.454 --> 05:25.596
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO HELP HER.

05:25.596 --> 05:28.399
( sniffing )
STRAWBERRIES AND RABBIT?

05:28.399 --> 05:31.031
OH. CHLOE'S EXCITED
ABOUT SOMETHING.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.734
( squealing,
whooping )

05:33.734 --> 05:35.906
THERE'S THE SUGAR!

05:40.641 --> 05:44.615
( knock on door )
HOW'S IT GOING IN THERE, HONEY?
HOW'S THE BOOK COMING?

05:44.615 --> 05:47.077
Bennett: FANTASTIC!
BUT I NEED QUIET.
DO NOT COME IN.

05:47.077 --> 05:50.120
IT'S LIKE A BLIZZARD
OF IDEAS IN HERE!

05:52.653 --> 05:54.785
THIS IS AWESOME!

05:54.785 --> 05:56.627
DON'T TELL MOMMY.

05:56.627 --> 06:00.360
SHE WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND
HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS
TO MY CREATIVE PROCESS.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.593
HOW IS THIS IMPORTANT
TO YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS?

06:02.593 --> 06:06.437
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION,
BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE
A LONG TIME TO ANSWER.

06:06.437 --> 06:08.939
SO LET'S GO DISCUSS IT
OVER A SNACK.
OKAY!

06:10.841 --> 06:14.445
Stan: YIKES. SOMETIMES
I DON'T KNOW IF HE IS
A CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST

06:14.445 --> 06:18.078
OR HE NEEDS A CHILD
PSYCHOLOGIST.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.681
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING IN HERE
THAT CAN HELP AVERY.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.883
WHAT HAVE YOU WRITTEN
SO FAR, BENNETT?

06:24.014 --> 06:25.416
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!

06:25.416 --> 06:27.057
I'M NOT IN THE DEDICATION!

06:27.057 --> 06:29.389
COME ON, COME ON...

06:29.389 --> 06:31.762
"CHAPTER FOUR.
"MOTHER KNOWS BEST.

06:31.762 --> 06:34.064
SHE WAS ONCE
A TEENAGE GIRL TOO..."

06:34.064 --> 06:36.727
HOW IS THAT GONNA
HELP AVERY?

06:36.727 --> 06:38.168
WAIT...

06:40.100 --> 06:43.403
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU LETTING ME SPEND
THE NIGHT HERE, TYLER.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.405
YOU LIVE IN THAT TRUCK,
AND I CRASHED IT.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.508
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.
LET ME JUST CLEAR IT
WITH MY FOLKS.

06:47.508 --> 06:50.410
IF IT'S A PROBLEM,
THE HAWK HAS SPENT
MANY A NIGHT UNDER THE STARS.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.683
ONCE IN THE FLAMINGO MARSH
AT THE ZOO.

06:52.683 --> 06:55.015
I ACTUALLY STARTED
TO GROW FEATHERS. LOOK.

06:56.547 --> 06:59.089
( bird-like squawking )

06:59.089 --> 07:01.752
( laughing )
I'M KIDDIN'.

07:01.752 --> 07:04.154
SO, UH, IT'S OKAY
IF I STAY?

07:04.154 --> 07:07.427
YOU'RE STAYING HERE
UNTIL YOUR TRUCK
IS FIXED TOMORROW.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.000
I INSIST,
MY PARENTS WILL INSIST.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.103
IS IT OKAY IF A BUDDY
SPENDS THE NIGHT--
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

07:13.103 --> 07:15.806
BUT MOM, I--
YOUR FATHER HAS TO
FINISH HIS BOOK.

07:15.806 --> 07:17.508
NO DISTRACTIONS.
RIGHT, BENNETT?

07:19.470 --> 07:23.443
BENNETT!
BUILDING A JUICE BOX JUMBO JET
IS PART OF MY PROCESS.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.477
I'M GONNA GO UP ON THE ROOF
AND SEE IF THIS BABY FLIES.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.080
COULD MY FRIEND JUST STAY--
NO!!!

07:30.080 --> 07:32.152
THEY'RE COOL WITH IT.
COME ON IN.

07:38.789 --> 07:41.091
WHAT A DAY!
HA HA HA!

07:41.091 --> 07:43.934
I JUST WANT TO PUT MY FEET UP
AND RELAX.

07:43.934 --> 07:46.166
Bennett: YES, ELLEN,
I'M GOING BACK TO WORK.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.038
RACE YOU UP THE STAIRS!
OHH!

07:48.038 --> 07:49.600
GO GO GO!

07:49.600 --> 07:51.101
( footsteps pounding )

07:51.101 --> 07:52.603
HEY!!!

07:52.603 --> 07:54.945
HOW BIG ARE YOUR FEET
GETTING?!

07:54.945 --> 07:56.607
( fake laugh )

07:59.479 --> 08:02.252
(sniffing ) OH.
IT SMELLS EVEN SADDER IN HERE.

08:04.615 --> 08:06.857
STAN.

08:06.857 --> 08:09.690
THERE'S SOMETHING IN
YOUR DAD'S NEW BOOK
THAT CAN HELP YOU.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.662
I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T NEED ANY HELP.

08:11.662 --> 08:13.193
NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS:

08:13.193 --> 08:15.125
"OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT
HAVE THEIR HEART SHATTERED,

08:15.125 --> 08:17.497
"FEELINGS SCATTERED,
DIGNITY TATTERED,

08:17.497 --> 08:20.000
"SOUL BATTERED,
HOPE SPLATTERED.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.003
LUCKY FOR ME,
IT NEVER REALLY MATTERED."

08:23.003 --> 08:25.235
I LIKE THE LIGHT,
BREEZY TONE.

08:25.235 --> 08:28.208
AVERY, YOUR DAD'S BOOK SAYS
YOUR MOM IS THE KEY.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.840
SHE'LL KNOW HOW TO HELP YOU.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.842
YOU JUST HAVE TO IGNORE
ALL THE CRAZINESS

08:31.842 --> 08:33.944
THAT USUALLY
COMES OUT OF HER MOUTH.

08:33.944 --> 08:37.217
THAT'S MY PART,
IT WASN'T IN THE BOOK--
UNTIL I TYPED IT.

08:37.217 --> 08:40.250
SHE'S THE LAST PERSON
I WANT TO TALK TO
ABOUT GETTING DUMPED.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.553
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE
THAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP.

08:42.553 --> 08:44.695
WAIT. DUSTIN DUMPED YOU?

08:44.695 --> 08:47.858
YOU SAID IT WAS MUTUAL.
NO WONDER YOU'RE SO UPSET.

08:47.858 --> 08:49.860
I'M NOT UPSET!
THEN WHY ARE YOU
RAISING YOUR VOICE?

08:49.860 --> 08:52.703
I'M NOT RAISING MY VOICE.
YOU HAVE SUPER-HEARING.

08:52.703 --> 08:55.165
AND A DRAMATIC PROFILE.

08:55.165 --> 08:57.167
BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

08:57.167 --> 09:00.310
I'M FINE. I DON'T NEED
TO TALK TO MOM,
OR ANYONE ELSE.

09:00.310 --> 09:03.173
IT'S LIKE MOM ALWAYS SAYS:
I'M HER BRAVE SOLDIER.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.076
AVERY, I WANT TO HELP YOU!

09:06.076 --> 09:09.249
WELL, I WANT YOU
TO LEAVE ME ALONE!

09:09.249 --> 09:11.321
NOW I'M SMELLING
A LITTLE BIT OF PEE.

09:11.321 --> 09:14.785
PROBABLY BECAUSE SHE SNAPPED
AT ME AND IT SCARED ME.

09:14.785 --> 09:17.087
IF AVERY WON'T GO TO HER MOM,

09:17.087 --> 09:18.959
I'VE GOTTA GET HER MOM
TO GO TO HER.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.861
I'VE GOTTA GET THIS MESSAGE
TO ELLEN.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.793
BUT I HAVE TO BE SUBTLE.

09:22.793 --> 09:23.864
( doorbell rings )

09:25.596 --> 09:28.769
♪ I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM ♪

09:28.769 --> 09:30.340
♪ SO YOU NEED TO TALK TO-- ♪

09:32.142 --> 09:34.244
SO MUCH FOR
THE GORILLA-GRAM.

09:34.244 --> 09:36.146
ON TO PLAN B.

09:36.146 --> 09:38.078
YES, HELLO, THIS IS ONE OF

09:38.078 --> 09:39.610
AVERY'S TEACHERS,

09:39.610 --> 09:41.812
I REALLY THINK
YOU NEED TO TALK--

09:41.812 --> 09:43.814
I'M SORRY. YOUR NAME IS?

09:43.814 --> 09:46.757
MY NAME? MR. DOGMAN.

09:46.757 --> 09:50.090
STAN, YOU WANT TO
COME TO MY TEA PARTY?

09:50.090 --> 09:53.223
MY IMAGINARY FRIEND
UNDER-THE-STAIR BEAR
MIGHT BE THERE.

09:53.223 --> 09:55.225
OW! YOU'RE ON MY TAIL!

09:55.225 --> 09:56.767
WHAT?!
OH--

09:56.767 --> 09:58.198
MY--MY PONYTAIL.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.330
I'M A HIPPIE.
I TEACH ENGLISH, MAN.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.936
I KNOW ALL OF AVERY'S TEACHERS.
I DON'T RECALL A MR. DOGMAN.

10:05.936 --> 10:07.978
CHLOE, DO YOU KNOW
A TEACHER AT SCHOOL
NAMED MR. DOGMAN?

10:07.978 --> 10:10.941
YES. I HEAR HE'S RUFF!

10:11.982 --> 10:13.213
OH, I-I'M A SUBSTITUTE.

10:13.213 --> 10:16.086
I'M FILLING IN
FOR MR. SICKMAN.

10:16.086 --> 10:17.287
AND I SUPPOSE
HE'S OUT SICK.

10:17.287 --> 10:20.751
NO, HE'S AT A FRIEND'S
WEDDING, ACTUALLY.

10:20.751 --> 10:23.153
I DON'T APPRECIATE
PRANK PHONE CALLS.

10:23.153 --> 10:24.755
NO, DON'T HANG UP. I--

10:24.755 --> 10:26.126
( dial tone )
OHHH.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.128
WELL, AT LEAST THE CALL
I MADE BEFORE THIS WORKED OUT.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.230
WE'VE GOT FIFTEEN PIZZAS COMING!

10:30.230 --> 10:31.862
WHOO-HOO!

10:31.862 --> 10:33.303
YEAH-EAH!

10:34.234 --> 10:36.266
OH! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

10:36.266 --> 10:38.769
I SAID YOU COULD
HANG IN MY ROOM.
GOTTA EAT.

10:38.769 --> 10:42.272
NEED MY LATE-AFTERNOON-
EARLY-EVENING-PRE-DINNER NOSH.

10:42.272 --> 10:44.675
THIS IS A FINELY TUNED
MACHINE.

10:44.675 --> 10:47.417
OKAY, OKAY...
YOU DO NOT WANT
A LIGHTHEADED HAWK.

10:47.417 --> 10:49.319
HE DON'T FLY SO STRAIGHT.

10:49.319 --> 10:51.882
GO BACK TO MY ROOM
AND I'LL BRING YOU A SNACK.

10:51.882 --> 10:53.984
OH, YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

10:53.984 --> 10:57.127
AND I'M NOT FUSSY,
BUT IF YOU'VE GOT
FRESH SEASONAL FRUIT

10:57.127 --> 10:59.229
DRIZZLED WITH FLAX SEED
AND HOME-ROASTED GRANOLA

10:59.229 --> 11:01.091
ACCOMPANIED BY
A FEW MISSION FIGS,

11:01.091 --> 11:02.662
THAT'D BE DUCKY.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.134
Bennett: TYLER!
YOU UP THERE?

11:04.134 --> 11:06.997
HEY! REMEMBER MY SISTER?
YOU SHOULD SAY HI TO HER!

11:06.997 --> 11:08.939
OH, TYLER!
THERE YOU ARE.

11:08.939 --> 11:10.140
JUST ONE SECOND, DAD.

11:13.003 --> 11:15.145
LOOK! AVERY, IT'S HAWK.
TALK TO HIM.

11:15.145 --> 11:18.008
HELLO?

11:18.008 --> 11:20.010
HOWDY-DO!

11:20.010 --> 11:22.382
HOWDY-DO PRETTY GOOD!

11:25.685 --> 11:27.187
OH, COOL!

11:27.187 --> 11:29.689
YOU SLEEP WITH BUTTERFLIES.

11:29.689 --> 11:34.024
YEAH. IN MY FOOD TRUCK
I SLEEP WITH BUTTER AND FRIES.

11:35.726 --> 11:37.898
JUST TRYING TO RELATE.

11:42.172 --> 11:45.005
DON'T FEEL BAD.
THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.880
I'D LOVE TO TALK,
BUT SHOULDN'T YOU
GET BACK TO YOUR BOOK?

11:49.880 --> 11:54.144
EXACTLY. SON, I NEED
SOME AUTHENTIC TEENAGE QUOTES
FOR ONE OF THE CHAPTERS.

11:54.144 --> 11:56.887
MAN, DO I HAVE TO?
PERFECT! MORE OF THOSE.

11:58.188 --> 12:01.351
YOU SEE, IN SPOKEN WORD,
YOU SAY WHAT YOU FEEL,

12:01.351 --> 12:05.255
AND THROUGH THOSE WORDS
EVOKE A SENSE OF EXACTLY
HOW YOU FEEL.

12:05.255 --> 12:08.198
OKAY. HERE GOES:

12:08.198 --> 12:09.399
"SO HUNGRY,

12:09.399 --> 12:10.931
"HEAD SPINNING,

12:10.931 --> 12:12.132
"LEGS WOBBLING,

12:12.132 --> 12:13.403
GETTING DARK."

12:17.167 --> 12:18.839
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS!

12:18.839 --> 12:21.471
CAN'T YOU JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?
THIS IS SO LAME!

12:21.471 --> 12:23.143
THESE ARE ALL GREAT!

12:23.143 --> 12:25.445
"THIS IS SO LAME."
THANKS!

12:28.979 --> 12:30.080
AAAH!

12:32.752 --> 12:34.324
HOWDY-DO!

12:37.157 --> 12:39.259
HEY, MOM,
COULD I HAVE A SNACK?

12:39.259 --> 12:40.760
AS LONG AS IT'S HEALTHY.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.094
DO WE HAVE ANY SEASONAL FRUIT,
FLAX SEED, OR FIGS?

12:44.094 --> 12:46.266
WHAT?
THOSE THINGS
JUST MELLOW ME OUT.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.437
AAAH!

12:55.445 --> 12:57.107
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?!

12:57.107 --> 12:58.778
I NEEDED AIR.

12:58.778 --> 13:02.112
AH! I CAN SEE ORION'S BELT--
AND HIS BELLY BUTTON.

13:02.112 --> 13:04.414
ORION, PLEASE!
PULL YOUR SHIRT DOWN!

13:06.156 --> 13:08.458
I THOUGHT I TURNED
THE PATIO LIGHTS ON.

13:13.223 --> 13:15.195
Stan: GOTTA PEE,
GOTTA PEE, GOTTA PEE!

13:15.195 --> 13:16.827
SOMEBODY LET ME OUT!

13:16.827 --> 13:18.999
OKAY, STAN, I GET IT.
WATER.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.331
(barks) OH,
DON'T SAY WATER!

13:21.331 --> 13:22.502
REFRESHING WATER!

13:22.502 --> 13:24.204
PLEASE DON'T SAY--

13:24.204 --> 13:26.036
WET, WONDERFUL WATER!

13:26.036 --> 13:28.208
AAAHHH!
DOESN'T SHE UNDERSTAND?

13:28.208 --> 13:31.481
IF SHE DOESN'T LET ME OUT
I'M GOING TO EXPLODE?!

13:31.481 --> 13:34.214
WAIT! THAT'S AVERY'S PROBLEM--

13:34.214 --> 13:36.346
SHE'S HOLDING
ALL THESE FEELINGS INSIDE,

13:36.346 --> 13:38.018
AND IF SHE DOESN'T
LET THEM OUT,

13:38.018 --> 13:40.120
SHE'S GOING TO EXPLODE!

13:40.120 --> 13:42.853
I HAVE TO GO TELL HER THAT.
IMMEDIATELY!

13:42.853 --> 13:45.225
OKAY, NOT IMMEDIATELY.

13:51.061 --> 13:54.534
SO, I'M IN BAJA,
AND I'M ON THIS MULE...

13:54.534 --> 13:56.466
YEAH, YEAH,
NEVER KISS A MULE.

13:56.466 --> 13:58.068
LET'S GO BACK
TO MY ROOM.

13:58.068 --> 14:00.410
TYLER, YOU'VE BEEN
ACTING WEIRD ALL NIGHT.

14:00.410 --> 14:02.042
DO YOUR PARENTS
REALLY KNOW I'M HERE?

14:02.042 --> 14:04.975
YEAH! IT'S JUST MY DAD
CAN'T HAVE ANY DISTRACTIONS.

14:04.975 --> 14:06.846
HE'S BUSY
FINISHING HIS BOOK.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.920
AH. THEN THE HAWK
IS INVISIBLE.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.122
( loud clatter )

14:12.122 --> 14:13.523
WHAT WAS THAT?

14:13.523 --> 14:14.885
QUICK! GET IN HERE!

14:14.885 --> 14:17.587
I TOLD YOU PEOPLE
I AM TRYING TO WORK!

14:21.992 --> 14:23.533
WH--

14:23.533 --> 14:25.936
I...KNOCKED THEM OVER
WITH MY BIG FEET.

14:27.237 --> 14:28.899
COME HOLD THIS TOGETHER
WHILE I GLUE IT.

14:33.643 --> 14:35.946
ARE YOU THE
UNDER-THE-STAIR BEAR?

14:35.946 --> 14:37.307
I'M THE HAWK!

14:37.307 --> 14:38.878
THAT'LL DO.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.911
TEA?
OOH.

14:40.911 --> 14:42.252
TWO SUGARS, PLEASE.

14:42.252 --> 14:44.554
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT REAL,
RIGHT?

14:44.554 --> 14:45.585
THEN THREE.

14:49.219 --> 14:50.520
AVERY, LISTEN--

14:50.520 --> 14:52.392
BEFORE YOU START
GIVING ME MORE ADVICE,

14:52.392 --> 14:54.624
CHECK THIS OUT.
IT'S A PICTURE OF SAUL GOODE--

14:54.624 --> 14:55.926
TO GO WITH MY POEM.

14:58.298 --> 15:01.601
I SEE. I'M NOT SURE
IF SAUL GOODE FOR
THE KID ON THE ALLIGATOR

15:01.601 --> 15:03.333
WITH THE PIANO
FALLING ON HIS HEAD.

15:03.333 --> 15:04.534
IS THAT DUSTIN?

15:04.534 --> 15:06.676
NO, IT'S JUST SOME
RANDOM ALLIGATOR.

15:06.676 --> 15:10.941
AVERY, YOU'RE SAD BECAUSE
YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR EMOTIONS IN.

15:10.941 --> 15:14.384
YOU NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT
AND CRY AND LET IT ALL OUT!

15:14.384 --> 15:17.017
YEAH, THAT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE ME.

15:17.017 --> 15:20.590
BESIDES, I'VE GOT MY POEM
AND MY THINLY VEILED ARTWORK.

15:23.653 --> 15:28.228
ONE THING I KNOW AS A DOG IS,
YOU HAVE TO LET IT OUT
OR YOU'LL EXPLODE!

15:28.228 --> 15:29.960
AND ACCORDING TO
YOUR FATHER'S BOOK,

15:29.960 --> 15:32.002
YOU HAVE TO LET IT OUT
ALL OVER YOUR MOM.

15:32.002 --> 15:33.633
IT WON'T HELP, STAN.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.635
I DON'T EVEN THINK
SHE'D KNOW WHAT TO SAY
ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.307
HAVE YOU EVER ASKED HER?

15:37.307 --> 15:38.708
WELL...NO, BUT--

15:38.708 --> 15:41.541
IT'S NOT FAIR TO ASSUME
SOMEBODY CAN'T HELP

15:41.541 --> 15:42.642
IF YOU'VE NEVER ASKED.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.475
AND I'M GONNA KEEP BUGGING YOU
UNTIL YOU TALK TO HER.

15:45.475 --> 15:48.518
BUG ME ALL YOU WANT.
I AM NOT TALKING TO HER.

15:48.518 --> 15:50.950
FINE. THEN I'M GONNA
RECITE THE MANUSCRIPT

15:50.950 --> 15:54.324
FOR MY TEEN VAMPIRE NOVEL
FROM START TO FINISH.

15:54.324 --> 15:56.356
"AT FIRST LIGHT,
JENNY FELT SAD AND CON--"

15:56.356 --> 15:57.527
FINE! I'LL TALK TO HER.

16:00.130 --> 16:02.062
WHERE IS HE?!
WHO?!

16:02.062 --> 16:05.135
HOW MANY FOOD TRUCK OWNERS
HAVE YOU GOT STUFFED IN HERE?

16:05.135 --> 16:06.596
THE HAWK.

16:06.596 --> 16:10.570
OH. HE DROPPED AN ORANGE,
AND IT ROLLED DOWN
THE TUNNEL OF DESPAIR.

16:11.671 --> 16:15.145
WE MAY NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.
TEA?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.614
OHH! (gasps)

16:24.614 --> 16:27.617
WHAT MAGICAL PORTAL
HAVE I GONE THROUGH?

16:29.719 --> 16:31.521
( clatter, glass breaks )

16:31.521 --> 16:34.394
NO MORE DISTRACTIONS,
BENNETT, NO MORE.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.226
"IS TALKING TO YOURSELF
A DISTRACTION?"

16:36.226 --> 16:38.028
"YES."
"THEN STOP IT!"

16:41.201 --> 16:43.103
HAWK, WHERE ARE YOU?

16:46.036 --> 16:48.308
WHERE WERE YOU?
I LOOKED ALL OVER THE HOUSE!

16:48.308 --> 16:51.241
I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE HOUSE.

16:51.241 --> 16:53.543
I WAS TOO BIG TO TURN AROUND,

16:53.543 --> 16:56.046
SO I JUST KEPT
FOLLOWING THE LIGHT.

16:56.046 --> 16:58.288
I THINK I SAW MY GRANDMA.

16:58.288 --> 17:00.290
LET'S GET YOU
OUT OF THIS HALLWAY, QUICK.

17:00.290 --> 17:01.621
LEVEL WITH ME, TYLER.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.694
YOUR PARENTS REALLY DON'T
KNOW I'M HERE, DO THEY?

17:04.694 --> 17:07.557
NO. NO, HAWK,
THEY DON'T.

17:07.557 --> 17:10.160
THAT IS NOT COOL, MAN.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.502
I DIDN'T WANT TO
LET YOU DOWN AFTER WHAT I DID.

17:12.502 --> 17:14.664
I THOUGHT I COULD PULL IT OFF
FOR ONE NIGHT.

17:14.664 --> 17:16.306
WHILE I APPRECIATE
THE GESTURE,

17:16.306 --> 17:18.438
WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS NOT MATURE.

17:18.438 --> 17:21.771
AND THIS IS COMING FROM A GUY
WHO STILL CARRIES A SCRAP
OF HIS BINKY.

17:21.771 --> 17:22.772
( gasps )

17:24.043 --> 17:25.115
OHH...

17:27.577 --> 17:30.480
GIVE ME ONE MORE CHANCE
TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.622
PLEASE. YOU GO TAKE A SHOWER,

17:32.622 --> 17:35.625
AND WHEN YOU COME DOWN,
IT'LL ALL BE GOOD.

17:35.625 --> 17:37.287
I PROMISE.

17:37.287 --> 17:40.460
FINE. BUT I MIGHT BE
IN THAT SHOWER FOR A WHILE.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.763
THIS TOP LAYER
IS JUST THE TIP
OF THE DIRTBERG.

17:47.537 --> 17:50.600
HI, MOM.
HI, SWEETIE.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.103
I JUST NEED TO TALK TO YOU
REAL QUICK. IT'S--

17:53.103 --> 17:55.445
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL
OR ANYTHING, IT'S...

17:55.445 --> 17:56.576
IT WAS ACTUALLY
A FRIEND'S IDEA.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.748
OKAY. WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

17:58.748 --> 18:01.451
DUSTIN.
OH.

18:01.451 --> 18:02.682
YEAH, I, UH,

18:02.682 --> 18:04.784
I THOUGHT THAT
THIS MIGHT HELP.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.317
A SCRIPT?

18:07.317 --> 18:10.120
YEAH. YOU SAY YOUR LINES
AND I'LL SAY MY LINES.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.222
IT'LL BE FUN!

18:12.222 --> 18:14.124
OKAY. I'LL PLAY AVERY.

18:14.124 --> 18:15.695
JUST KIDDING.

18:17.667 --> 18:20.700
RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
( laughs nervously )

18:20.700 --> 18:21.831
"MOM, COULD I TALK TO YOU--"
"MOM, COULD I TALK TO YOU--"

18:21.831 --> 18:24.704
SORRY, SORRY.
I WAS NERVOUS.

18:24.704 --> 18:25.835
LET'S START AGAIN.

18:25.835 --> 18:28.538
"MOM, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?"

18:28.538 --> 18:31.381
"OF COURSE, AVERY.
WHAT IS YOUR CONCERN?"

18:31.381 --> 18:32.682
COULD I SAY
"WHAT'S" YOUR CONCERN?

18:32.682 --> 18:33.683
THE "WHAT IS" SOUNDS
A LITTLE FORMAL.

18:33.683 --> 18:35.515
YEAH, WHATEVER
FEELS NATURAL.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.647
NONE OF THIS FEELS
NATURAL, SWEETIE.

18:37.647 --> 18:39.249
MOM?

18:40.750 --> 18:43.122
"SOMETHING SEEMS TO BE
BOTHERING YOU."

18:43.122 --> 18:45.695
"AS YOU KNOW,
DUSTIN AND I HAVE...

18:49.199 --> 18:50.660
BROKEN UP."

18:50.660 --> 18:53.132
"AND ARE YOU OKAY?"

18:53.132 --> 18:55.705
"ACTUALLY, I AM A LITTLE SAD."

18:55.705 --> 18:57.607
YOU ARE?

18:57.607 --> 19:00.210
THAT'S NOT IN THE SCRIPT.

19:00.210 --> 19:02.542
YA KNOW, FORGET IT.
THIS ISN'T EVEN WORKING.

19:02.542 --> 19:03.743
SWEETIE,
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.546
I KNOW. BUT WE'VE NEVER
DONE THIS BEFORE.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.378
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT,
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT--

19:08.378 --> 19:11.150
I THOUGHT THAT
THE SCRIPT WOULD HELP,
BUT I GUESS NOT.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.284
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I DON'T NEED A SCRIPT
TO TALK TO YOU!

19:14.284 --> 19:16.726
NOT IF IT'S ABOUT CHEERLEADING
OR ABOUT MY GRADES

19:16.726 --> 19:19.529
OR ABOUT FALLING
THROUGH SIDEWALKS, BUT...

19:19.529 --> 19:21.361
WE NEVER TALK
ABOUT MY FEELINGS.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.632
YOU'VE NEVER LET ME.

19:23.933 --> 19:26.696
I THOUGHT THAT YOU WANTED ME
TO BE YOUR BRAVE SOLDIER.

19:26.696 --> 19:30.200
OH, I DIDN'T MEAN
YOU COULDN'T COME TO ME
WHEN YOU NEEDED ME.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.702
I'LL ALWAYS
BE HERE FOR YOU!

19:32.702 --> 19:36.476
(crying) MOM,
WHY DO I FEEL SO BAD
THAT DUSTIN DUMPED ME?

19:36.476 --> 19:39.349
I DIDN'T EVEN
CARE ABOUT HIM THAT MUCH.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

19:39.349 --> 19:41.581
NO, SWEETIE.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU.

19:41.581 --> 19:45.615
IT'S YOUR FIRST BREAKUP.
BREAKUP'S ARE HARD.
IT'S OKAY TO BE SAD.

19:45.615 --> 19:47.787
IT FEELS SO GOOD
TO LET IT OUT.

19:50.460 --> 19:52.462
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE REALLY
GOOD AT THIS, MOM.

19:52.462 --> 19:53.623
( laughs affectionately )

19:55.525 --> 19:57.427
BUT IT REALLY HURTS!

19:57.427 --> 19:59.269
I KNOW, SWEETIE, I KNOW.

19:59.269 --> 20:02.602
NO-- YOUR BONY CHIN
IS JABBING INTO MY SKULL.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.633
OH!

20:07.277 --> 20:09.909
MMM. PEPPERMINT
AND POODLE BUTT.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.682
HAPPINESS!

20:12.682 --> 20:15.915
I WAS REALLY GLAD
I COULD HELP AVERY
AND HER MOM COME TOGETHER.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.618
AND I'M REALLY GLAD
AVERY DIDN'T EXPLODE.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.690
GRANTED, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A SMALL EXPLOSION,

20:20.690 --> 20:23.953
BUT STILL, THERE WOULD HAVE
BEEN EMOTION EVERYWHERE.

20:23.953 --> 20:26.796
AND I'M GLAD IT GAVE
BENNETT THE IDEA FOR
HIS NEW BOOK TITLE--

20:26.796 --> 20:28.728
"LET IT OUT."

20:28.728 --> 20:30.930
I WAS THINKING OF SUING,

20:30.930 --> 20:33.603
BUT THEN I JUST DECIDED I'D
WRITE MY OWN PSYCHOLOGY BOOK--

20:33.603 --> 20:35.535
"YOU SMELL SAD."

20:39.469 --> 20:41.311
OKAY, I HAVE
SOMETHING TO ASK YOU,

20:41.311 --> 20:42.612
BUT I DON'T
REALLY KNOW HOW.

20:42.612 --> 20:45.275
OH, SWEETIE,
YOU CAN ALWAYS COME TO ME!

20:45.275 --> 20:47.577
I WILL ALWAYS
BE HERE FOR YOU!

20:47.577 --> 20:49.379
NO, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

20:49.379 --> 20:51.521
AND OW! YOUR CHIN.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.754
WHAT IS IT, SON?
YOU CAN ASK US
ANYTHING.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.727
LET'S SAY I HAD A FRIEND--
LIKE THE HAWK--

20:57.727 --> 21:00.390
SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN
REALLY GOOD TO ME--
LIKE THE HAWK--

21:00.390 --> 21:02.292
AND LET'S SAY, HYPOTHETICALLY,

21:02.292 --> 21:04.294
I CRASHED THE HAWK'S
FOOD TRUCK BY ACCIDENT,

21:04.294 --> 21:06.636
AND THE HAWK,
OR THAT FRIEND,

21:06.636 --> 21:08.468
HAD NOWHERE
TO SLEEP FOR THE NIGHT.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.670
WOULDN'T YOU EXPECT ME
TO HELP THAT FRIEND OUT?

21:10.670 --> 21:15.875
(sighs) TYLER,
WE WILL DEAL WITH
THE TRUCK SITUATION LATER.

21:15.875 --> 21:19.509
CALL THE HAWK RIGHT NOW...

21:19.509 --> 21:22.051
TELL HIM HE IS WELCOME
TO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH US.

21:22.051 --> 21:23.683
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,

21:23.683 --> 21:27.687
UH, BUT DOES THE SHOWER LEVER
GO LEFT OR RIGHT?

21:27.687 --> 21:29.759
I'M TRYING TO GET
THAT MIDDLE NOZZLE

21:29.759 --> 21:31.921
TO POWER CLEAN MY CREASES.

21:33.423 --> 21:34.994
IS THAT YOUR BATHROBE?

21:34.994 --> 21:36.666
NOT ANYMORE.
