00:02.752 --> 00:04.378
Previously on Friends:

00:04.546 --> 00:06.046
- Excuse me, miss.
- It's Phoebe.

00:06.256 --> 00:08.340
- Will that be all?
- They're twins.

00:08.550 --> 00:11.051
Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot.

00:11.261 --> 00:14.972
- It's for Ursula.
- Sure, yeah. Okay, it fits.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.932
Marcel, give Rossy the remote.

00:19.561 --> 00:20.894
How did he do this?

00:21.104 --> 00:23.439
It's this whole stupid Ursula thing.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.859
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?

00:27.068 --> 00:29.319
- You don't know my sister.
- Talk to Joey.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.363
- He's falling in love with her.
- You won't lose him.

00:32.573 --> 00:36.035
They haven't even slept together yet.
That's not serious.

00:37.412 --> 00:40.122
Oh. Um, yeah.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.665
May we help you?

00:43.126 --> 00:44.626
Rachel! Rachel!

00:44.961 --> 00:47.087
I'm okay. I'm okay.

00:49.007 --> 00:50.924
Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow.

00:51.092 --> 00:53.469
Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow.

00:54.387 --> 00:57.473
Uh, hi, uh, my friend was taking down
our Christmas lights...

00:57.682 --> 01:00.934
...and she fell off the balcony
and may have broken her foot or ankle.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.729
My God, you still have
your Christmas lights up?

01:06.149 --> 01:07.900
Fill this out and bring it back.

01:08.318 --> 01:11.612
- Okay. Here you go.
- Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.990
Okay. Whew.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.283
All right.

01:16.618 --> 01:17.993
Name...

01:18.244 --> 01:19.495
...address...

01:20.371 --> 01:22.915
Okay. In case of emergency, call?

01:23.166 --> 01:24.333
You.

01:24.709 --> 01:25.751
Really?

01:26.377 --> 01:27.419
Yeah.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.588
Oh, that is so sweet.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.842
Oh, gosh. I love you.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.594
Okay, insurance?

01:35.887 --> 01:38.806
Oh, yeah, check it.
Definitely gonna want some of that.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.475
You don't have insurance?

01:41.726 --> 01:43.310
Why? How much is this gonna cost?

01:43.561 --> 01:46.313
I have no idea, but X-rays alone
could be a couple hundred dollars.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.982
- What are we gonna do?
- There's not much we can do.

01:50.068 --> 01:53.737
Uh, unless I use yours.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.573
No, no, no, no, no.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.075
Well, now, wait a second.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.495
Who did I just put as my
"in case of emergency" person?

02:01.913 --> 02:03.497
That's insurance fraud.

02:05.208 --> 02:08.502
Well, all right, then. Forget it.
Might as well just go home.

02:08.752 --> 02:10.044
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Okay, okay.

02:11.589 --> 02:15.008
- Okay, come here. I hate this.
- Thank you. I love you.

02:15.885 --> 02:20.389
Hi, heh. Um, I'm gonna need
a new set of these forms.

02:20.890 --> 02:21.932
Why?

02:23.393 --> 02:25.435
I am really an idiot.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.022
You see, I was filling out
my friend's form...

02:29.232 --> 02:31.400
...and instead of putting
her information...

02:31.651 --> 02:32.901
...I put mine.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.028
You are an idiot.

02:35.905 --> 02:39.199
Yep, that's me. Heh.
I am that stupid.

02:41.244 --> 02:44.246
I had a dream last night
where I was playing football with my kid.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.331
- That's nice.
- That's nice.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.375
No, no. With him.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.715
I'm on this field,
and they hike me the baby.

02:56.426 --> 03:00.179
I know I've gotta do something because the
Tampa Bay defense is coming right at me.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.599
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.

03:04.517 --> 03:05.893
Right, but...

03:07.145 --> 03:11.106
...it is just me and the baby,
so I'm thinking they can take us.

03:12.942 --> 03:14.985
And so I, uh, heh...

03:15.153 --> 03:16.737
I just heave it downfield.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.864
What are you, crazy?
That's a baby.

03:19.073 --> 03:21.325
He should take the sack?

03:24.913 --> 03:28.332
Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield.

03:28.583 --> 03:32.419
And I realize that I'm the one
who's supposed to catch him, right?

03:32.670 --> 03:35.380
Only I know there's no way
I'm not gonna get there in time.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.424
So I am running and I'm running...

03:37.634 --> 03:39.301
...and that is when I woke up.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.930
See, I am so not ready
to be a father.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.057
Hey, you're gonna be fine.

03:45.266 --> 03:48.644
You're one of the most caring,
responsible men in North America.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.022
You're gonna make a great dad.

03:52.273 --> 03:55.859
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby
just need better blocking.

03:59.155 --> 04:03.033
Oh. Have either of you ever been to
the Rainbow Room? Is it expensive?

04:03.284 --> 04:04.952
Only if you order stuff.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.580
I'm taking Ursula tonight.
It's her birthday.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.833
- Whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
- When's that?

04:12.001 --> 04:13.585
Uh...

04:14.462 --> 04:15.504
...tonight.

04:15.672 --> 04:19.091
Ugh, man, what are the odds
of that happening?

04:21.261 --> 04:22.970
You take your time.

04:28.476 --> 04:29.643
There it is.

04:33.564 --> 04:34.606
So, what are you gonna do?

04:35.441 --> 04:39.319
What can I do? I don't want
to screw it up with Ursula.

04:39.570 --> 04:40.612
And your friend Phoebe?

04:40.863 --> 04:44.741
If she's my friend, hopefully
she'll understand. Wouldn't you guys?

04:45.243 --> 04:47.077
Man, if you tried that on my birthday...

04:47.328 --> 04:50.580
...you'd be staring at
the business end of a hissy fit.

04:53.167 --> 04:56.211
You add a pinch of saffron,
it makes all the difference.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.466
Okay, uh...

05:01.634 --> 05:03.552
- Monica?
- Yes?

05:04.012 --> 05:05.762
Yes, she is.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.640
- Hi. This is my friend Rachel.
- Hi.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.392
Hi, uh, Rachel, I'm Dr. Mitchell.

05:10.601 --> 05:13.103
And I'm his friend Dr. Rosen.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.023
Aren't you a little cute
to be a doctor?

05:16.232 --> 05:17.482
Excuse me?

05:17.734 --> 05:19.609
God, young, young.
I meant young, heh.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.069
Young to be a doctor.

05:21.237 --> 05:23.071
- Oh, good, Rach.
- Thank you.

05:23.239 --> 05:24.323
Right.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.752
So he said it was just a sprain,
and that was it.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.254
Uh, you left out the stupid part.

05:39.922 --> 05:40.964
It's not stupid.

05:41.215 --> 05:45.552
The very cute doctors asked us out
for tomorrow night, and I said yes.

05:45.803 --> 05:49.056
I think it's totally insane.
I mean, they work for the hospital.

05:49.265 --> 05:52.184
It's like returning
to the scene of the crime.

05:52.810 --> 05:56.813
- I say we blow off the dates.
- What? Monica, they are cute.

05:57.065 --> 06:00.692
They are doctors. Cute doctors.
Doctors who are cute.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.653
All right, what have
we learned so far?

06:12.914 --> 06:14.206
Surprise!

06:21.881 --> 06:24.716
What the hell are you doing?
You scared the crap out of me.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.387
- Was that the cake?
- Yeah.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.972
I got a lemon shmush.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.683
Come on.
She'll be here any minute.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.769
I hope it's okay.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.983
"Happy Birthday, Peehee."

06:43.986 --> 06:46.446
Maybe we can make
a B out of one of those roses.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.116
Yeah, we'll just use
our special cake tools.

06:50.034 --> 06:51.827
- Hey, what's going on?
- Oh, we just...

06:51.994 --> 06:53.495
Surprise!

06:53.663 --> 06:55.497
Oh, oh, oh!

06:56.958 --> 06:58.750
This is so great.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.001
Oh, my God.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.087
This was not at all scary.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.005
Hi, everybody. Hi, Betty.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.465
Betty, hi.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.969
You found Betty.
Oh, my gosh. This is so great.

07:09.220 --> 07:12.597
Everybody I love is in the same room.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.516
Where's Joey?

07:17.353 --> 07:18.770
Did you see Betty?

07:29.240 --> 07:32.993
I tell you, I wouldn't mind having a piece
of this sun-dried-tomato business.

07:33.786 --> 07:38.165
Five years ago, if somebody'd said to me,
"Here's a tomato that looks like a prune"...

07:38.374 --> 07:40.750
...I'd have said,
"Get out of my office."

07:44.130 --> 07:46.965
Dad, before I was born,
did you freak out at all?

07:47.175 --> 07:48.925
I'm not freaking out.
I'm just saying...

07:49.093 --> 07:50.927
...if someone had come to me
with the idea...

07:51.095 --> 07:55.682
Dad, Dad, Dad. I'm talking about
the whole, uh, baby thing.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.768
Did you, uh, ever get this sort of...

07:59.020 --> 08:03.440
...panicky, "Oh, my God, I'm gonna
be a father" kind of a thing?

08:03.691 --> 08:04.983
No.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.695
Your mother really did the work.
I was busy with the business.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.780
I wasn't around that much.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.991
Is that what this is about?

08:13.201 --> 08:14.951
No, no, Dad. I was just wondering.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.622
There's time to make up for that.
We can do stuff together.

08:18.873 --> 08:23.251
You always wanted to go to colonial
Williamsburg. How about we do that?

08:23.878 --> 08:25.712
Thanks, Dad. Really, heh.

08:25.963 --> 08:28.590
You know, I just, I just...

08:29.258 --> 08:31.551
I just needed to know, um...

08:31.761 --> 08:34.846
...when did you start
to feel like a father?

08:35.056 --> 08:41.186
Oh. Well, I guess it must have been
the day after you were born.

08:41.812 --> 08:44.856
We were in the hospital room,
your mother was asleep...

08:45.107 --> 08:48.902
...and they brought you in
and gave you to me.

08:49.111 --> 08:51.238
You were this ugly little red thing.

08:52.657 --> 08:56.952
And all of a sudden, you grabbed
my finger with your whole fist...

08:57.203 --> 08:58.745
...and you squeezed it...

08:58.996 --> 09:00.705
...so tight.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.459
And that's when I knew.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.465
So you don't want to go
to Williamsburg?

09:13.803 --> 09:15.720
We can go to Williamsburg.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.640
Eat your fish.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.230
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.

09:25.481 --> 09:26.898
Okay, coming.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.776
Hi, come on in.
Hey, Michael, Jeffrey.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.361
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.654
Uh, here, we brought wine.

09:32.822 --> 09:36.992
Look at this. It's from the cellars
of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.911
- So how could we resist?
- Oh, that's great.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.205
- So, Monica, how's the ankle?
- It's, uh...

09:44.709 --> 09:46.585
Why don't you tell them?

09:47.003 --> 09:48.753
After all, it is your ankle.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.215
You know, it's feeling a lot better.
Thank you.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.093
Listen, why don't you guys sit down,
and we'll get you some glasses.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.178
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:57.346 --> 10:00.098
- Um...
- Stat.

10:02.727 --> 10:06.021
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we
just tell them who we really are?

10:06.272 --> 10:10.150
- I mean, I think it'll be fine.
- It will not. We'll get in trouble.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.277
Monica, would you stop being
such a wuss?

10:12.612 --> 10:16.323
A wuss? Excuse me
for living in the real world.

10:16.657 --> 10:18.950
- So?
- So they still seem normal.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.410
That's because they are.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.330
You have to admit, when we go out
with women we meet at the hospital...

10:23.497 --> 10:25.665
Would you relax?
Take a look around.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.127
There are no pagan altars.

10:30.212 --> 10:33.089
No piles of bones in the corners.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.467
They're fine. Go like this:

10:39.347 --> 10:43.391
I said we are not going to do it, okay?
Sometimes you can be such a big baby.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.226
- I am not a baby.
- Be serious.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.604
- You get uptight...
- You act like a princess.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.231
- You know what? You know what?
- What? What?

10:50.441 --> 10:54.361
Every day you are becoming
more and more like your mother.

10:54.570 --> 10:57.489
Excuse me. Hello, here we go.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.576
This is a great place.
How long have you lived here?

11:01.786 --> 11:04.746
Thanks. I've been here
about six years.

11:04.955 --> 11:08.124
And Rachel moved in a few months ago.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.711
See, I was supposed to get married...

11:11.921 --> 11:13.963
...but, um, I left the guy at the altar.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.219
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:19.470 --> 11:22.180
Yeah, I know
it's pretty selfish, but, heh...

11:22.431 --> 11:24.808
...hey, that's me.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.855
- Why don't you try the hummus?
- Ahem.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.399
So, Monica, what do you do?

11:32.566 --> 11:35.902
Uh, I am a, uh, chef
at a restaurant uptown.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.571
- Oh, good for you.
- Yeah, it is.

11:39.907 --> 11:44.828
Mostly because I get to boss people
around, which I just love to do.

11:47.289 --> 11:48.957
Well, this hummus is great.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.875
God bless the chickpea.

11:55.756 --> 11:56.965
Oh, God.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.634
I am so spoiled.

12:03.889 --> 12:04.931
That's it.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.227
And by the way, have I mentioned
that back in high school...

12:09.437 --> 12:10.812
...I was a cow?

12:13.149 --> 12:15.275
I used to wet my bed.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.987
I use my breasts to get
other people's attention.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.114
We both do that.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.214
Monica and Rachel's apartment.

12:38.382 --> 12:42.427
Uh... Uh, yeah, just one second.
Uh, Rachel, it's your dad.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.639
Hi, Dad.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.850
No, no. It's me.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.604
Listen, Dad,
I can't talk right now. Um...

12:52.813 --> 12:54.898
But there's something, um...

12:55.107 --> 12:57.942
There's something
that I've been meaning to tell you.

12:58.444 --> 12:59.486
Excuse me.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.946
Remember back in freshman year?

13:02.156 --> 13:05.116
Well, Billy Dreskin and I
had sex on your bed.

13:15.419 --> 13:16.503
Daddy...

13:17.588 --> 13:20.465
Daddy... Daddy, why?
Why would I sleep with Billy Dreskin?

13:20.716 --> 13:22.967
His father tried to put
you out of business.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.677
You are dead.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.100
Ross, he's got the remote again.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.519
Good.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.063
Maybe he can switch it back.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.276
Maybe not.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.196
Hello?

13:45.199 --> 13:46.699
Uh, ueah... Uh...

13:47.701 --> 13:51.120
Okay, uh, hold on a second and let me
just check and see if she's here.

13:51.330 --> 13:55.250
It's the woman from the hospital.
There's a problem with the form.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.168
Oh, God, what do we do?

13:57.419 --> 13:59.212
I don't know.
Just find out what they want.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.297
Okay. No, you do it.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.217
Hello. This is Monica.

14:04.635 --> 14:05.760
Yeah?

14:06.595 --> 14:08.179
Oh. Okay.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.723
Yes, we'll be right down.
Thank you.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.644
We forgot to sign
one of the admissions forms.

14:15.312 --> 14:18.106
- Okay, you're right, this wasn't worth it.
- Thank you.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.066
- Okay, let me just change.
- Yes.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.238
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.240
Trouble?

14:28.492 --> 14:30.618
Your sister stood me up
the other night.

14:30.828 --> 14:34.455
Oh, no. Don't you hate it
when people aren't there for you?

14:36.417 --> 14:39.377
- Did you try calling her?
- I've been trying for two days.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.380
When I called the restaurant,
they said she was too busy to talk.

14:42.631 --> 14:45.300
I can't believe
she's blowing me off.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.778
Hey.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.323
Oh.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.409
Um, you got a minute?

15:11.660 --> 15:14.495
Um, yeah, I'm just working.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.631
- So...
- Uh-huh?

15:26.342 --> 15:28.551
Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.345
Oh, wow, you remembered.

15:35.059 --> 15:38.311
Oh. It's a Judy Jetson Thermos.

15:38.520 --> 15:39.812
Right. Like the kind you...

15:40.022 --> 15:41.189
Right.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.025
Oh, I got something for you too.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.443
How'd you know I was coming?

15:45.611 --> 15:48.780
Um, yeah, um, "twin" thing.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.368
I can't believe you did this.

15:53.577 --> 15:55.370
I can't believe you...

15:55.621 --> 15:57.246
...did this.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.670
So, what's the deal with, um,
you and Joey?

16:04.505 --> 16:05.838
Oh, right.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.841
He is so great. But that's over.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.594
- Does he know?
- Who?

16:12.471 --> 16:17.100
Joey. You know, um, ahem,
he's really nutsy about you.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.060
He is? Why?

16:19.353 --> 16:21.229
- You got me.
- Right.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.522
Excuse me...

16:22.773 --> 16:25.400
...doesn't this come
with a side salad?

16:27.027 --> 16:28.861
So, um, are you gonna call him?

16:29.071 --> 16:31.948
- What, you think he likes me?
- No. Joey.

16:32.324 --> 16:37.078
Oh. No, no. He is so smart.
He'll figure it out.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.955
Do you want some chicken?

16:39.748 --> 16:42.083
No, no.
No food with a face, remember?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.128
You have not changed.

16:45.462 --> 16:46.879
Yeah, you too.

16:50.384 --> 16:53.094
- Hi. Remember us?
- Mm-hm.

16:53.762 --> 16:57.557
Um, yeah, you just called about needing
a signature on the admissions form?

16:57.808 --> 17:00.268
Well, it turns out
we need a whole new one.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.562
Because, um, you see...

17:03.105 --> 17:05.231
...I put the wrong name again.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.776
- Because, um...
- You're that stupid.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.739
I am. I'm that stupid.

17:13.323 --> 17:15.825
Yeah, and I'm just gonna pay
for this with a check.

17:16.242 --> 17:18.077
You know, your insurance will cover that.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.872
Yeah, I know.
I'm just not that bright either.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.584
Okay, worst case scenario:

17:24.917 --> 17:28.212
- Say you never feel like a father.
- Uh-huh.

17:28.380 --> 17:32.341
Say your son never feels
connected to you as one.

17:32.843 --> 17:36.471
Say all of his relationships
are affected by this.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.389
Do you have a point?

17:39.600 --> 17:41.517
You know, you'd think I would.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.522
What's up with the simian?

17:47.608 --> 17:49.650
It's just a fur ball.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.154
Okay, whose turn is it?

17:53.363 --> 17:55.323
Yours. I just got 43 points for "kidney."

17:55.741 --> 17:59.077
No, you got zero points for "idney."

17:59.286 --> 18:01.621
I had a K. Where's my K?

18:08.712 --> 18:11.631
You've got to help me.
My monkey swallowed a K.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.341
Get that animal out of here.

18:13.550 --> 18:17.011
The animal hospital is way across town.
He's choking. I don't know what to do.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.889
- What's going on?
- Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.

18:22.017 --> 18:25.645
Excuse me.
This hospital is for people.

18:25.854 --> 18:28.231
Lady, he is people.
He has a name, okay?

18:28.440 --> 18:30.066
He watches Jeopardy...

18:30.275 --> 18:33.027
...he touches himself
when nobody's watching.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.613
Please, have a heart.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.074
- I'll take a look at him.
- Oh, thank you.

18:38.325 --> 18:39.367
- Michael.
- Rachel.

18:39.576 --> 18:40.618
- What?
- Monica.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.620
- Oh.
- Hi.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.175
Hey.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.261
Urs.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.763
What are you doing here?
I've been trying to call you.

19:01.932 --> 19:02.974
Listen, um...

19:03.142 --> 19:07.019
Don't say "listen." I know that
"listen." I've said that "listen."

19:08.272 --> 19:09.313
I'm sorry.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.358
I don't get it.
What happened?

19:12.609 --> 19:15.027
What about everything
you said under the bridge?

19:15.988 --> 19:18.322
Yeah, um, ahem...

19:19.116 --> 19:21.742
You know, just forget about
what I said under the bridge.

19:21.952 --> 19:25.163
I was talking crazy that night.
I was so drunk.

19:26.832 --> 19:27.874
You don't drink.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.585
That's right, I don't.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.087
But I was drunk on you.

19:34.256 --> 19:37.049
- Oh, Urs.
- But, yeah, so it's not gonna work.

19:37.759 --> 19:40.428
Why? Is it because
I'm friends with Phoebe?

19:41.680 --> 19:44.473
If it was, would you
stop hanging out with her?

19:46.643 --> 19:47.685
No.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.645
No, I couldn't do that.

19:50.397 --> 19:53.107
Um, then, yeah, it's because of Phoebe.

19:54.526 --> 19:57.278
So you know, it's either her or me.

19:58.739 --> 20:01.866
Then, uh... Then I'm sorry.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.080
You know...

20:08.248 --> 20:10.625
...you're gonna be
really, really hard to get over.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.501
I know.

20:18.717 --> 20:23.137
I don't know whether it's just
because we're breaking up or what...

20:23.388 --> 20:25.389
...but you have never
looked so beautiful.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.099
Really?

20:57.965 --> 20:59.423
- Pheebs?
- Yeah.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.394
He looks so tiny.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.814
- We just got the message.
- Is he all right?

21:15.023 --> 21:17.358
Yeah, the doctor got the K out.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.319
He also found an M and an O.

21:22.239 --> 21:25.074
We think he was trying
to spell out "monkey."

21:31.415 --> 21:34.875
The doctor says he'll be fine.
He's just sleeping now.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.337
So you feel like a dad yet?

21:38.588 --> 21:40.339
No. Why?

21:40.716 --> 21:44.343
Hey, come on, you came through.
You did what you had to do.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.053
That is very dad.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.763
Oh, look, he's waking up.

21:48.098 --> 21:50.558
Hey, fella. How you doing?

22:19.713 --> 22:21.672
Ooh.
