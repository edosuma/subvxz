00:40.297 --> 00:44.494
Year after year, 20-something
women come to New York City...

00:44.668 --> 00:47.500
...in search of the two L's:

00:47.671 --> 00:50.866
Labels and love.

00:53.742 --> 00:55.904
- Yeah.
- It's the best.

00:57.047 --> 00:59.105
Hot dress!

00:59.516 --> 01:02.610
Twenty years ago, I was one of them.

01:13.730 --> 01:18.826
Having gotten the knack for labels early,
I concentrated on my search for love.

01:19.003 --> 01:23.165
Turns out, a knockoff is not as
easy to spot when it comes to love.

01:23.340 --> 01:25.240
What? You're married?

01:25.407 --> 01:27.672
You fucking asshole!
Motherfucker, you're married?

01:27.844 --> 01:30.175
- Until it is.
- I fucking hate you.

01:30.348 --> 01:32.780
That is why you need help to spot them.

01:33.316 --> 01:34.942
Lots of help.

01:35.117 --> 01:38.143
Help also known as Charlotte York...

01:39.724 --> 01:41.621
...Miranda Hobbes...

01:42.425 --> 01:44.220
...and Samantha Jones.

01:44.527 --> 01:47.928
- Oh, my God, look at his.
Hey.

01:48.230 --> 01:49.458
Hi, how are you?

01:53.236 --> 01:54.327
Oh, well.

01:56.274 --> 02:00.232
My name is Carrie Bradshaw,
and I'm a writer.

02:00.410 --> 02:04.210
Year after year,
my single girlfriends were my salvation.

02:04.382 --> 02:07.009
And as it turns out, my meal ticket.

02:09.251 --> 02:12.242
I've been dating since I was 15.
I'm exhausted. Where is he?

02:12.421 --> 02:14.821
Charlotte was looking
for the perfect love.

02:14.991 --> 02:18.049
- Trey can't get it up.
- Well, almost perfect.

02:18.227 --> 02:19.750
I'm becoming a Jew.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.932
We're not barren,
we're reproductively challenged.

02:27.103 --> 02:29.333
- They're giving us a baby.
- That's our baby.

02:29.506 --> 02:32.906
So Charlotte and Harry journeyed
to China and back...

02:33.076 --> 02:35.270
...for their daughter, Lily.

02:36.112 --> 02:38.636
Miranda was a disciple of tough love.

02:38.815 --> 02:40.510
Bye. Great sex.

02:42.352 --> 02:43.944
- Steve, I'm pregnant.
- You're what?

02:44.120 --> 02:45.142
Carrie.

02:45.322 --> 02:48.188
I, Miranda Hobbes,
take you, Steve Brady...

02:48.357 --> 02:51.385
And Miranda journeyed to Brooklyn
for Brady and Steve.

02:51.561 --> 02:53.722
Who wants a Popsicle?

02:53.898 --> 02:55.864
Oh, man. Boy.

02:56.033 --> 02:58.968
Samantha's love was sex.

02:59.136 --> 03:00.659
Lots of sex.

03:00.838 --> 03:03.360
I'm dating a guy
with the funkiest-tasting spunk.

03:03.540 --> 03:04.870
Can I cancel my rice pudding?

03:05.042 --> 03:08.636
And then she found a man
that combined sex and love.

03:08.812 --> 03:10.144
I'm gonna help you be a star.

03:11.915 --> 03:13.212
Yes, he is interested...

03:13.383 --> 03:18.615
So Samantha journeyed to Hollywood
with television star Smith Jerrod.

03:19.256 --> 03:23.021
As for me,
I was looking for something big.

03:24.194 --> 03:25.492
Get in.

03:25.664 --> 03:31.692
Mr. Big. Turns out when that big
love comes along, it's not always easy.

03:31.969 --> 03:33.128
Just tell me I'm the one.

03:33.303 --> 03:36.431
And despite all the other chapters
of my life...

03:36.607 --> 03:40.099
...no one was ever quite
big enough until...

03:40.276 --> 03:41.573
Carrie, you're the one.

03:41.745 --> 03:44.646
And just like that, I was.

03:46.284 --> 03:49.046
Three books and three years later...

03:49.220 --> 03:52.986
...we still feel like those
four single girls.

03:53.158 --> 03:55.716
And even though time
had moved us on...

03:55.893 --> 03:59.453
...I managed to stay exactly
where I was:

04:01.732 --> 04:02.791
In love.

04:16.180 --> 04:17.805
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:18.081 --> 04:19.983
I got a good feeling
about this one, kid.

04:20.152 --> 04:22.210
Oh, I hope so.
I've always loved this block.

04:23.153 --> 04:25.178
Hi, 3C?

04:25.357 --> 04:28.223
Finding the perfect apartment
in New York City...

04:28.393 --> 04:32.055
...is like finding the perfect partner.
It can take years.

04:32.228 --> 04:35.925
- So how many is this?
- Thirty-three.

04:36.099 --> 04:38.261
Lucky 33.

04:41.472 --> 04:46.409
- The worst. I just left you a message.
- And the kitchen's through here.

04:47.812 --> 04:49.473
That's the window with the best view.

04:50.916 --> 04:54.908
Thirty-four? Lucky 34?

04:55.420 --> 04:58.411
Well, if anything else opens up,
let us know.

04:58.591 --> 05:01.421
We're very interested
in this building.

05:01.592 --> 05:04.459
I do have another apartment
that's not even on the market yet.

05:04.628 --> 05:05.889
Care to take a look?

05:06.064 --> 05:07.086
- Sure.
- Sure.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.821
All right, then.

05:09.467 --> 05:12.229
It's more than you were looking to pay.

05:12.402 --> 05:14.701
- How much more?
- More.

05:23.316 --> 05:26.011
So this is where they keep the light.

05:26.183 --> 05:28.241
Oh, my God.

05:28.419 --> 05:33.289
I have died
and gone to real-estate heaven.

05:34.391 --> 05:36.358
Just a simple home for two.

05:37.928 --> 05:40.897
And across the rooftop terrace...

05:41.066 --> 05:43.328
What, nirvana?

05:47.406 --> 05:50.499
Hello. I live here.

05:51.109 --> 05:52.837
Your wife has quite a sense of humor.

05:53.879 --> 05:57.109
- They're not married.
- He's my boyfriend.

05:57.648 --> 05:59.446
This way.

06:00.651 --> 06:04.245
Aren't I a little old
to be introduced as your boyfriend?

06:04.420 --> 06:08.255
Point taken. From now on,
you'll be my man-friend.

06:08.426 --> 06:12.156
- That sounds like a dog.
- Well, if the shoe fits...

06:12.328 --> 06:14.729
And this is the master bedroom.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.161
Uh.

06:16.333 --> 06:20.598
It's hideous. I hate it. Hurts my eyes.

06:21.773 --> 06:25.571
- How is this place even available?
- Nasty divorce.

06:25.743 --> 06:28.872
If you live here,
what is there to fight about?

06:35.387 --> 06:36.683
Hm.

06:36.854 --> 06:40.516
- Well, now I understand the divorce.
- I can build you a better closet.

06:43.495 --> 06:44.963
Welcome home, baby.

06:46.230 --> 06:49.131
Can...? Can we afford this?

06:50.368 --> 06:51.994
I got it.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.737
Okay, let's sign some contracts.

06:55.907 --> 06:57.169
"I got it. " Just like that.

06:57.342 --> 07:00.309
- Like he was picking up a check for coffee.
- It sounds perfect.

07:00.478 --> 07:02.741
Except for the closet,
which Big says he can redo.

07:02.915 --> 07:04.540
And he says the kitchen needs work.

07:04.715 --> 07:08.048
Of course, I don't know about that
because I keep sweaters in my stove.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.346
So he bought it
and you'll live there with him.

07:10.521 --> 07:11.818
Yes, together. That's right.

07:11.990 --> 07:14.653
But he'll own it, so
you're keeping your own place, right?

07:14.827 --> 07:17.386
I haven't figured out the details,
but I'm a smart girl.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.961
I'll figure out something
that I'm comfortable with.

07:20.131 --> 07:22.223
I just wanna be sure
that you're being smart.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.832
And I love you for that.

07:24.001 --> 07:26.560
But for now,
can't you stop worrying for me...

07:26.738 --> 07:29.933
...and just go ahead and feel
what I want you to feel, jealous?

07:30.309 --> 07:35.574
Oh, jealous of me living in this
gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.576
- All right, I'm jealous.
- Thanks.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.648
You live in real-estate heaven
and I live in Brooklyn.

07:40.818 --> 07:43.718
New York magazine said
Brooklyn is the new Manhattan.

07:43.887 --> 07:45.719
Whoever wrote that
lives in Brooklyn.

07:45.890 --> 07:48.291
- Hey, there she is.
Hey, Hollywood.
- Hey.

07:50.028 --> 07:51.927
Oh, lady. Hi.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.065
- How was your flight?
- Fabulous.

07:54.233 --> 07:55.255
- Oh, good.
- Good.

07:55.432 --> 07:57.060
- Let's go in. I'm so excited.
Show us.

07:58.403 --> 08:03.466
It was a rare occasion that brought
all types of New York women together.

08:03.641 --> 08:05.164
Sorry.

08:05.944 --> 08:09.470
Blair Elkenn was a waitress
turned model turned actress...

08:09.648 --> 08:12.549
...turned billionaire's girlfriend
who came home one night...

08:12.717 --> 08:16.346
...to find herself unceremoniously
turned out on the street.

08:16.521 --> 08:17.545
Oh, my God.

08:17.724 --> 08:21.055
And now she was getting
the ultimate breakup revenge:

08:21.226 --> 08:23.249
An embarrassing
and very public auction...

08:23.430 --> 08:26.557
...of all the jewelry he had given her
when they were happy.

08:27.033 --> 08:30.057
There it is. My baby.

08:30.235 --> 08:31.723
Oh, she's a beauty.

08:31.903 --> 08:34.837
When I saw it in the catalog,
I said to Smith:

08:35.006 --> 08:39.465
"This flower ring is the essence of me.
One of a kind, filled with fire. "

08:39.645 --> 08:42.580
- And a little too much.
- Exactly.

08:42.748 --> 08:46.274
Let's go spend some of
my hard-earned Hollywood money.

08:46.451 --> 08:49.419
And now Lot 39, the flower ring.

08:49.586 --> 08:50.612
That's it.

08:50.790 --> 08:53.519
We'd like to start the bidding
on this at $ 10,000, please.

08:53.693 --> 08:56.523
At ten-thousand doll...
Thank you, madam. At 10,000.

08:56.695 --> 08:59.184
Fifteen thousand. At $ 15,000.

08:59.364 --> 09:02.265
Hey, she's bidding for somebody
on the phone.

09:03.035 --> 09:05.901
That's not fair.
- Bitch.

09:06.070 --> 09:08.094
The gloves are off.

09:08.273 --> 09:10.833
At $30,000. Now it's against you.
Thirty-five thousand.

09:11.010 --> 09:13.443
- I work hard, I deserve this.
- At 40,000 now.

09:13.713 --> 09:17.113
At 40? Forty thousand?
Forty thousand, thank you.

09:17.283 --> 09:20.218
Forty-five thousand. At $45,000.
Now 50,000?

09:20.386 --> 09:22.945
Fifty fucking thousand.

09:23.722 --> 09:28.351
At 50,000. Fifty-five thousand?
At $55,000 against you.

09:28.527 --> 09:32.962
Would you like to say 60?
Sixty to our colorful bidder? At 60,000?

09:33.131 --> 09:35.190
I draw the line at 50.

09:37.503 --> 09:40.836
I thought this auction would be more fun,
but it's kind of sad.

09:41.006 --> 09:42.063
Isn't it?

09:42.241 --> 09:45.404
I thought it was just sad for me
because I know her.

09:45.578 --> 09:47.272
But it really is sad, huh?

09:47.780 --> 09:49.839
And it's funny
because they were so happy.

09:50.015 --> 09:52.482
- Yeah, till they weren't.
- I know, right?

09:53.817 --> 09:57.948
We all told her to get married
but she didn't wanna listen.

09:58.124 --> 10:01.388
He'd been married three times before,
so she let it ride...

10:01.559 --> 10:05.392
...and then she came home one night
and he had locked her out.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.428
She didn't even have anywhere to live.

10:07.900 --> 10:11.095
Such a shame. After 10 years.

10:11.270 --> 10:12.965
She was a smart girl...

10:13.140 --> 10:15.267
...till she fell in love.

10:23.515 --> 10:25.643
I'm thinking...

10:26.484 --> 10:29.612
...I'm going to sell my apartment...

10:29.788 --> 10:31.848
...and put the money towards
heaven on 5th.

10:32.023 --> 10:34.013
Why? You love your apartment.

10:34.192 --> 10:38.185
I know, but there's plenty of room
in the new place and...

10:38.596 --> 10:41.759
And besides, I...

10:41.934 --> 10:44.493
I want to make us a life there.

10:44.803 --> 10:47.863
You know, I... I want it to be ours.

10:48.039 --> 10:51.203
It is ours. I bought it for us.

10:51.377 --> 10:55.211
And that's so amazing,
but you bought it.

10:56.014 --> 11:01.179
So really it's your place
and if anything were to happen...

11:01.352 --> 11:02.752
What's going to happen?

11:02.920 --> 11:07.723
Come on, I have to be smart here.We're
not married, I'd have no legal rights...

11:07.894 --> 11:12.125
...you know, to...
To this home that I built...

11:13.232 --> 11:15.061
...with you.

11:17.204 --> 11:19.069
Did you wanna get married?

11:22.241 --> 11:25.869
Well, I didn't...
I didn't think that was an option.

11:26.246 --> 11:27.644
What if it was an option?

11:29.515 --> 11:31.539
Why? What, do you wanna get married?

11:31.950 --> 11:34.943
I wouldn't mind being married to you.

11:35.121 --> 11:37.554
Would you mind being married to me?

11:38.157 --> 11:42.183
No. No, not if...
Not if that's what you wanted.

11:44.430 --> 11:47.887
I mean, is...? Is that what you want?

11:48.934 --> 11:50.925
I want you.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.332
So...

11:54.073 --> 11:55.768
...okay.

11:55.941 --> 11:57.431
So...?

11:57.676 --> 12:00.873
-Really? We're..? We're getting married?
-We're getting married.

12:01.047 --> 12:04.504
- Should we get you a diamond?
- No, no.

12:05.118 --> 12:07.712
Just get me a really big closet.

12:08.888 --> 12:14.019
So the other night Big and I
were talking about...

12:14.193 --> 12:19.187
...you know,
moving in together and our future...

12:19.365 --> 12:22.199
...and, you know, what makes sense
as we move forward and...

12:23.937 --> 12:25.836
...well...

12:27.306 --> 12:28.864
...we decided to get married.

12:31.777 --> 12:33.769
- And I'm deaf.
- I'm so excited!

12:34.247 --> 12:36.441
- Everybody is looking.
- Sorry!

12:36.615 --> 12:38.642
I'm so sorry, everyone...

12:38.817 --> 12:41.946
...but this is my friend
and she just got engaged.

12:42.121 --> 12:47.286
And she has been going out
with the man for 10 years.

12:51.563 --> 12:52.792
I'm mortified.

12:52.966 --> 12:56.060
There is literally a ringing in my ear.

12:57.503 --> 12:58.969
And the big news
was about to go bicoastal.

12:59.138 --> 13:00.161
Samantha Jones.

13:00.339 --> 13:04.436
Well, I made a little decision
I hope you'll be happy about.

13:04.612 --> 13:09.446
- Oh, honey, you finally got Botox.
- No, I did not get Botox.

13:09.615 --> 13:13.109
-I'm telling you,Carrie,you're gonna love it.
-I did not call...

13:13.286 --> 13:15.948
...to talk about Botox.
- Well, I'm just saying.

13:16.122 --> 13:18.351
So last week...

13:18.525 --> 13:21.890
...after the auction,
I started thinking about my options.

13:22.061 --> 13:25.155
- Right.
- And, um...

13:27.633 --> 13:30.193
Well, Big and I decided
to get married.

13:31.272 --> 13:34.240
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:34.609 --> 13:37.303
Well, that's great.

13:38.012 --> 13:39.875
You sounded more excited
about the Botox.

13:40.046 --> 13:43.345
Honey, I am excited for you,
but you know me.

13:43.517 --> 13:45.506
I don't really believe in marriage.

13:45.685 --> 13:49.348
Now, Botox, on the other hand,
that works every time.

13:49.522 --> 13:51.455
Honey, I... I gotta go.

13:51.624 --> 13:54.023
We can catch up
when I'm in town next week.

14:07.107 --> 14:08.131
Hello.

14:08.908 --> 14:10.375
I think I was in shock.

14:10.945 --> 14:13.174
I mean, it's you getting married.

14:13.346 --> 14:15.575
This is not some
random person, it's you.

14:15.749 --> 14:16.773
Yeah, I hear you.

14:16.950 --> 14:20.579
I thought that after that big mess with
Aidan, you'd never wanna get married.

14:21.954 --> 14:24.889
So I put you in my
"we're never getting married" file.

14:25.057 --> 14:27.253
Now I'm gonna have to
take you out of that file.

14:27.426 --> 14:31.420
Well, I'm sorry about
all the extra paperwork.

14:31.599 --> 14:32.622
You'll get my bill.

14:32.798 --> 14:35.768
Samantha, it just feels
so different this time.

14:35.936 --> 14:40.703
You know, there's no clichéd
romantic kneeling on one knee.

14:40.874 --> 14:42.465
It's just...

14:42.841 --> 14:47.369
...two grownups making a decision
about spending their lives together.

14:48.014 --> 14:50.607
Well, I'm happy for you.

14:51.283 --> 14:52.649
Oh, and hey, one more thing.

14:52.819 --> 14:57.189
I want you to be maid of honor.

14:57.357 --> 15:00.621
- How do you feel about that?
- The same way you feel about Botox:

15:00.794 --> 15:02.524
Painful and unnecessary.

15:03.030 --> 15:07.796
-Seventy-four,75,76. Seventy-six guests.
-Seventy-five sounds better.

15:07.968 --> 15:11.460
A small wedding of 75 guests.

15:11.639 --> 15:14.697
Seventy-six trombones, yes.
Seventy-six guests, no.

15:14.875 --> 15:16.865
As a wedding gift,
Charlotte had given me...

15:17.043 --> 15:19.670
...Anthony Marantino,
friend and wedding planner.

15:19.847 --> 15:21.473
All right.

15:21.947 --> 15:23.778
Well, that's...

15:24.250 --> 15:26.947
Cutthroat. I love it.
I hope you're this decisive...

15:27.120 --> 15:30.056
...when it comes to location and the dress.
- I found the dress.

15:30.224 --> 15:32.623
- What? When?
- Yeah, the other day. I have it.

15:34.862 --> 15:38.319
- This is gonna be good.
- I am so excited.

15:38.498 --> 15:40.329
Okay.

15:40.835 --> 15:42.699
Here it is.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.470
That was the exact reaction
I was aiming for.

15:49.810 --> 15:53.142
It's pretty, but it's... It's so simple.

15:53.313 --> 15:55.213
It's simple and classic.

15:55.382 --> 16:00.478
When I saw it, I thought,
"That is what I should marry Big in. "

16:00.654 --> 16:04.954
- Well, who's it by? What's the label?
- No one. I found it at a vintage shop.

16:06.060 --> 16:08.654
The bride wore a dress by no one.

16:08.829 --> 16:11.422
Oh, come on,
you know I'm gonna merchandise it up...

16:11.599 --> 16:13.998
...style it up with some shoes.
- Right.

16:15.236 --> 16:17.170
The invitation is fancier than the dress.

16:17.337 --> 16:19.305
- I heard that.
- I meant you to.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.897
Don't tell anyone.

16:31.184 --> 16:34.951
- "The ultimate single gal, Carrie
Bradshaw, will be married in Manolos...

16:35.123 --> 16:39.683
...to New York financier
John James Preston come fall. "

16:39.859 --> 16:43.023
- Our wedding's on Page Six.
- Who would put that in there?

16:43.196 --> 16:48.498
"Proving to single gals everywhere
that there can be a happy ending over 40."

16:50.938 --> 16:52.426
- Carrie.
- Congratulations.

16:52.605 --> 16:56.099
It seemed everywhere I went,
people had seen Page Six.

16:56.277 --> 17:00.237
Even people you didn't expect,
like my Vogue editor, Enid.

17:00.415 --> 17:02.974
We're putting together
our annual age issue...

17:03.150 --> 17:04.640
...and we'd like you to do 40.

17:04.819 --> 17:07.080
- Great. Who am I interviewing?
- No.

17:07.252 --> 17:09.347
You. You are 40.

17:09.523 --> 17:13.219
I want you to be featured in
the magazine as the 40-year-old...

17:13.394 --> 17:16.055
And here's the brilliant twist.
- Bride.

17:18.065 --> 17:21.363
Wait, I'm...
I would be in the magazine?

17:21.535 --> 17:24.992
In bridal couture.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...

17:25.172 --> 17:30.303
...so spare me a week of
faux soul-searching and just say yes.

17:30.477 --> 17:33.877
Enid, I am so very flattered,
but honestly, I...

17:34.047 --> 17:35.776
Carrie, Vogue designers.

17:35.950 --> 17:37.609
Vogue photographers.

17:37.785 --> 17:39.411
Vogue airbrushing.

17:40.054 --> 17:42.921
Nod your head. Yes.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.087
Thank you. It will be a sensation.

17:48.263 --> 17:50.730
We're calling it "The Last Single Girl. "

17:50.898 --> 17:54.925
Well, I'm hardly the last single girl.

17:55.103 --> 17:59.298
No, but 40 is the last age a woman
can be photographed in a wedding gown...

17:59.474 --> 18:02.374
...without the unintended
Diane Arbus subtext.

18:02.544 --> 18:06.037
I thought the issue was
"Great Style at Every Age. "

18:06.214 --> 18:09.307
Style, yes. Bride, no.

18:14.153 --> 18:16.314
- Is that better?
- Just your typical Wednesday.

18:16.490 --> 18:18.958
Hanging out with old friends
like Stanford Blatch...

18:19.592 --> 18:22.495
...and new friends like Vera Wang.

18:22.665 --> 18:26.258
She's looking at home for someone
who didn't think she had the bride gene.

18:26.432 --> 18:29.162
- Well, I guess with the right man...
- And the right dress.

18:29.703 --> 18:33.162
When I get married, I'm wearing
something like that, only bigger.

18:34.441 --> 18:35.931
Beauty. Hot.

18:36.478 --> 18:38.000
Love the veil.

18:38.178 --> 18:40.476
And Carolina Herrera.

18:43.118 --> 18:45.518
- Nothing fancy, but it's beautiful.
Good work.

18:45.686 --> 18:46.777
Great, let's do it.

18:57.999 --> 19:00.193
And Christian Lacroix.

19:09.678 --> 19:10.975
And Lanvin.

19:15.951 --> 19:16.974
And Dior.

19:25.727 --> 19:28.286
And Oscar de la Renta.

19:32.198 --> 19:36.500
And finally, Vivienne Westwood.

19:36.672 --> 19:39.003
A dress so special...

19:39.174 --> 19:44.167
...it could bring a wedding tear from
even the most unbelieving of women.

19:50.317 --> 19:54.584
And then, the impossible happened.

20:20.848 --> 20:22.213
And just like that...

20:22.384 --> 20:26.444
...Vivienne Westwood
kicked my sweet little suit's ass.

20:35.528 --> 20:37.224
Can I lean?

20:44.271 --> 20:47.402
Are you the last person in New York
still taking out library books?

20:47.575 --> 20:49.874
I love the smell.

20:51.112 --> 20:52.545
Mm.

20:53.781 --> 20:56.750
Oh. That's an oldie.

20:57.218 --> 20:59.652
"Love Letters of Great Men,
Volume One. "

20:59.822 --> 21:01.880
- Oh, am I in there?
- No, no.

21:02.057 --> 21:06.187
But some of your classmates are,
like Voltaire, Napoleon.

21:07.762 --> 21:11.925
- Young lady, you need to get glasses.
- No, I don't. I have yours.

21:12.099 --> 21:14.329
Okay, here's Napoleon.

21:14.770 --> 21:18.432
"My dearest Josephine,
I wake consumed with thoughts of you. "

21:18.607 --> 21:21.839
Typical short guy.
Gives it all away upfront.

21:22.144 --> 21:25.113
- Why are you reading this?
- It's research for my new book.

21:25.281 --> 21:28.875
- Oh. What's it about?
- Love.

21:29.050 --> 21:30.677
I used to write about finding love.

21:30.853 --> 21:34.254
Now I wanna write about
what happens after you've found it.

21:34.423 --> 21:36.185
Interesting.

21:36.357 --> 21:39.588
- What happens?
- Mm. Stay tuned.

21:40.261 --> 21:42.525
Oh, here, listen. It's Beethoven.

21:42.698 --> 21:45.063
Bring it, Ludwig.

21:46.702 --> 21:50.160
"My thoughts go out to you,
my immortal beloved.

21:50.339 --> 21:54.138
I can live only wholly with you
or not at all. "

21:54.310 --> 21:55.641
Good stuff.

21:55.811 --> 21:58.176
"Be calm my life, my all.

21:58.347 --> 22:01.180
Only by calm consideration
of our existence...

22:01.351 --> 22:04.147
...can we achieve
our purpose to live together.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.753
Oh, continue to love me.
Never misjudge...

22:06.921 --> 22:09.856
...the most faithful heart of your beloved.

22:10.024 --> 22:15.154
Ever thine. Ever mine. Ever ours. "

22:19.101 --> 22:21.500
Have you ever written me a love letter?

22:21.668 --> 22:23.136
Does a love fax count?

22:24.038 --> 22:28.169
- When have I ever gotten a love fax?
- Oh, I'm sure my secretary sent you one...

22:28.344 --> 22:30.675
...at some point.
- Yeah.

22:31.146 --> 22:34.241
What can I tell you, baby?
It's not my style.

22:34.416 --> 22:37.782
Besides, those guys had to write.
They were separated from their loves...

22:37.952 --> 22:41.615
...by wars
and hundreds and hundreds of miles.

22:41.789 --> 22:43.917
I'm right here.

22:44.094 --> 22:46.028
Hello.

22:47.496 --> 22:51.591
- You make me very happy.
- Yeah, yeah. Put it in writing.

22:52.735 --> 22:57.399
With my mind prenuptially preoccupied,
I became delinquent with my library books.

22:57.573 --> 23:01.374
So now the tragic love stories
of Wuthering Heights and Love Story...

23:01.545 --> 23:03.670
...were going to cost me
more than a few tears.

23:03.846 --> 23:05.836
Excuse me, which way is the wedding?

23:06.080 --> 23:07.980
Up the stairs.

23:18.960 --> 23:21.053
It was perfect.

23:21.231 --> 23:24.255
Big and I would be married
in the classic New York landmark...

23:24.433 --> 23:28.199
...that housed all the great love stories.

23:31.374 --> 23:33.169
Where is the waiter with the check?

23:33.341 --> 23:36.936
Jeez, Miranda, relax.
Magda hasn't even finished yet.

23:37.112 --> 23:39.739
I still have a brief to work on
when I get home.

23:39.914 --> 23:43.475
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- I'll take him.

23:43.653 --> 23:44.710
Thank you, Magda.

23:45.653 --> 23:49.420
We're gonna wash that beautiful face.
Come, darling.

23:51.794 --> 23:52.817
What?

23:52.995 --> 23:55.463
We can't let the hard-working nanny
finish her supper?

23:55.632 --> 23:59.260
I'm sorry, I'm exhausted.
Brady woke me up at 5 a. m.

23:59.435 --> 24:02.460
- Hey, he woke me up too.
- Yeah.

24:02.638 --> 24:05.435
We gotta stop letting Brady
come into our bed.

24:09.813 --> 24:11.677
You got milk on your top lip.

24:13.450 --> 24:14.610
What now?

24:14.784 --> 24:18.083
- It's like you're always criticizing me.
- I am not.

24:19.021 --> 24:23.185
You wanna go through life with foam
on your lip and no one ever telling you?

24:30.798 --> 24:33.029
Anything you wanna tell me?

24:40.109 --> 24:42.976
Hm. Is there anything you wanna tell me?

24:49.619 --> 24:54.113
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Wait. Wait. Don't come already.

24:54.290 --> 24:57.849
- Yeah.
- No, wait. Get on top.

24:58.026 --> 25:00.655
Let's just get it over with.

25:04.867 --> 25:08.303
I mean, we gotta get up
in four and a half hours.

25:09.506 --> 25:12.962
We never have sex
and you wanna get it over with?

25:18.182 --> 25:22.049
- Steve, we have sex.
- When was the last time we had sex?

25:23.019 --> 25:24.814
Um...

25:27.557 --> 25:30.390
There was snow on the ground.

25:36.901 --> 25:39.595
- How often do you guys have sex?
- Sex.

25:39.769 --> 25:41.565
- Miranda, please.
- What?

25:42.038 --> 25:44.165
She's 3.
She doesn't know what it means.

25:44.342 --> 25:46.331
I'm 41 and I still don't know
what it means.

25:46.508 --> 25:48.772
I know, but she is repeating everything.

25:48.945 --> 25:53.075
If I'd known the girl talk was gonna be on
lockdown, I wouldn't have flown 3000 miles.

25:53.248 --> 25:55.877
No, we can talk.
Let's just not use that word.

25:56.519 --> 26:00.045
Fine. How often do you guys...?

26:00.223 --> 26:01.917
- Color?
- Thank you.

26:02.091 --> 26:06.425
Well, I can't color enough.
I could color all day every day.

26:06.597 --> 26:10.691
If I had my way,
I would use every crayon in my box.

26:10.868 --> 26:14.099
We get it. You love to color.

26:14.270 --> 26:16.032
Why are you asking?

26:16.205 --> 26:21.405
Well, last night Steve and I were coloring,
and I was just about to...

26:21.579 --> 26:24.341
Come.
I'm sorry, there's no crayon equivalent.

26:24.513 --> 26:28.040
And he wanted to switch positions
and I said:

26:29.052 --> 26:30.610
"Let's just get it over with. "

26:33.224 --> 26:35.783
- He kept trying to make it last longer.
- This is bad?

26:35.959 --> 26:38.827
- It is when you have a full-time job.
- I have a full-time job.

26:38.996 --> 26:41.829
You don't also have a 5-year-old,
play dates, PTA meetings...

26:41.999 --> 26:45.434
...and a mother-in-law in a rest home
with advancing Alzheimer's.

26:45.602 --> 26:48.799
We're just going through
a no-coloring phase.

26:48.973 --> 26:51.770
- It comes and goes, right?
Every couple is different.

26:52.175 --> 26:54.666
Harry and I make love
two, three times a week.

26:54.843 --> 26:58.074
- Great, now I feel worse.
- Well, when was the last time for you?

27:00.084 --> 27:02.176
- Six months ago.
- Oh, my.

27:03.454 --> 27:05.444
It sounds long.

27:05.623 --> 27:08.592
- But... But that's a dry spell.
- I bet it is.

27:08.759 --> 27:12.159
Hey, Carrie. What about you and Big?

27:12.630 --> 27:15.655
Come on. I told. Tell.

27:15.833 --> 27:17.059
Mm-mm.

27:17.234 --> 27:19.200
But I will tell you this.

27:19.369 --> 27:21.132
When Big colors...

27:22.704 --> 27:26.104
...he rarely stays inside the lines.

27:26.277 --> 27:28.766
Well, this has been very helpful.

27:38.555 --> 27:40.386
John?

27:47.230 --> 27:49.424
- Hey.
- Come here.

27:57.607 --> 28:00.404
Totally outside the lines.

28:08.351 --> 28:11.718
Well, send it to Smith Jerrod
at the office address.

28:12.188 --> 28:14.520
I gotta go. Something just came up.

28:16.626 --> 28:20.527
- I got a gift for you.
- So far, I like it.

28:29.005 --> 28:30.336
How'd...?

28:30.908 --> 28:34.036
Wait. That was you on the phone
at the auction.

28:34.211 --> 28:38.341
- I knew how much you wanted it.
- But I was gonna buy it for myself.

28:38.749 --> 28:40.578
Well, I wanted to give it to you.

28:41.452 --> 28:43.578
For our anniversary.

28:43.753 --> 28:45.744
We met five years ago today.

28:47.257 --> 28:48.623
Right.

28:49.693 --> 28:51.024
Do you like it?

28:51.194 --> 28:54.094
Well, just to be clear,
this is a ring with diamonds...

28:54.264 --> 28:57.029
...it's not a diamond ring, right?
- Yeah.

28:58.300 --> 29:00.327
Well, in that case, I love it.

29:00.505 --> 29:03.871
It's my second favorite thing
I've ever found in there.

29:05.609 --> 29:10.273
Now, my gift is a little bit more oral.

29:11.715 --> 29:16.617
- Babe, I have to go to bed.
- Bed? It's 7:30.

29:16.787 --> 29:20.482
I have to be at the studio by 6 a. m.
And I need to get a workout in before that.

29:20.657 --> 29:22.319
You see, this is how it starts.

29:22.493 --> 29:26.825
Next thing you know, we're only
having sex three or four times a week.

29:56.827 --> 30:00.787
And that is how Samantha learned
she had a new neighbor.

30:01.698 --> 30:04.599
From then on, night after night...

30:04.768 --> 30:07.327
...while Smith got his beauty sleep...

30:09.275 --> 30:14.040
...Samantha found something
more interesting to watch than TiVo.

30:18.215 --> 30:21.012
- Keep going.
- Okay.

30:22.085 --> 30:24.213
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

30:25.689 --> 30:29.022
Okay. Open them.

30:31.362 --> 30:33.386
Double doors.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.998
So far, so good.

30:46.379 --> 30:48.505
Oh, my God.

30:51.782 --> 30:56.515
- Oh, you did me proud, mister.
- You like it?

30:57.922 --> 30:58.979
"Like it?"

31:03.828 --> 31:05.988
It's love at first sight.

31:06.164 --> 31:08.357
Oh, my.

31:08.532 --> 31:11.764
Here. Wait.

31:11.936 --> 31:13.459
Hold this.

31:21.210 --> 31:24.111
Now I believe this is all really happening.

31:25.016 --> 31:27.107
I can't believe it sold so fast.

31:27.284 --> 31:30.152
- It's a sign.
- Yeah, it's a sign I priced it too low.

31:31.557 --> 31:34.922
Hey, that's the food. Will you buzz
them in? And money's on the table.

31:35.093 --> 31:38.425
I'm gonna get started on the closet.
I should be done in about 17 years.

31:38.595 --> 31:41.893
All right. Pink Post-it: Take.

31:42.299 --> 31:45.358
Purple: Toss. Yellow: Storage.

31:45.536 --> 31:47.937
Oh, you're very good friends.

31:53.877 --> 31:55.674
Oh, my God.

31:58.149 --> 32:01.447
- I can't believe it.
Lily, look who it is. Aunt Samantha.

32:03.889 --> 32:07.483
- What are you doing here?
- A lot of shit went down in this place.

32:07.660 --> 32:10.184
Attention must be paid.

32:10.761 --> 32:11.852
Ah.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.456
Really, champagne.

32:23.576 --> 32:25.475
- Remember this?
- Oh, yeah.

32:25.644 --> 32:28.942
While Samantha put on
The Best of the '80s...

32:30.380 --> 32:33.282
...I put on the worst.

32:40.457 --> 32:42.084
Banana clip.

32:45.864 --> 32:47.626
Yeah.

32:48.198 --> 32:49.826
Work it.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.593
Madonna.

32:53.773 --> 32:56.968
Whoo, whoo!

33:05.984 --> 33:07.007
No fun.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.302
Aw.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.437
Work it harder.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.344
Oh, man.

34:27.534 --> 34:29.022
- Come here.
- Come here.

34:29.202 --> 34:31.532
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.907
It took four friends three days...

34:43.080 --> 34:47.176
...to put 20 years into 38 boxes.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.721
While I run over
to see your mother tomorrow...

35:30.896 --> 35:33.831
...maybe you could take Brady
by the first birthday party alone.

35:33.999 --> 35:38.697
And then I'll meet you at the twins' party,
and you can leave and be at the bar by 6.

35:39.605 --> 35:41.004
What's the matter?

35:43.242 --> 35:45.674
I had sex with someone else.

35:48.581 --> 35:51.448
And you're so amazing...

35:52.084 --> 35:54.848
...and I don't know how
I could do that to you.

35:55.020 --> 35:58.749
You and I hadn't had sex
in a really long time and I...

35:58.924 --> 36:00.254
God.

36:00.759 --> 36:03.318
It didn't mean anything.
It just happened once.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.190
And it's been killing me.

36:07.298 --> 36:09.027
It's killing you?

36:09.201 --> 36:10.463
It just happened.

36:11.237 --> 36:13.932
L... I...

36:14.106 --> 36:15.937
I... I... I wasn't thinking.

36:16.241 --> 36:18.904
Do not follow me.

36:30.190 --> 36:32.214
Scout, off.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.897
Miranda, it's still me.

36:46.373 --> 36:47.999
Is it?

37:01.420 --> 37:04.253
Steve. I just... I can't believe it.

37:04.724 --> 37:06.883
- That's what I said.
Yes, it's sad.

37:07.058 --> 37:10.152
But I'm not gonna make it any sadder
by staying at a bad hotel...

37:10.328 --> 37:13.197
...while I look for a place.
Could you pass the salt?

37:13.367 --> 37:15.767
Plus, I have to be downtown
and close to Brooklyn.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.768
We're gonna keep Brady's life
as normal as we possibly can.

37:18.938 --> 37:21.964
I'm gonna have him on my days
and Steve will have him on his...

37:22.142 --> 37:24.871
...and Magda will shuttle
back and forth between.

37:25.044 --> 37:28.036
Well, I don't really know
if this question is allowed...

37:28.214 --> 37:29.875
...but how is Steve handling this?

37:30.049 --> 37:32.985
Says he's devastated,
begs me to forgive him.

37:33.153 --> 37:35.746
It's not gonna happen.
I can barely even look at him.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.047
Miranda, honey,
are you sure you wanna do this?

37:38.557 --> 37:40.957
It's just one time.
Anyone can have a slip.

37:41.127 --> 37:45.222
Even if I could get my mind around that
justification, it's the cheating part.

37:45.665 --> 37:49.567
The behind-my-back part, the violation
of the trust. That's what's killing me.

37:58.778 --> 38:01.210
Thank you for being you.

38:04.416 --> 38:07.943
Charlotte made love to Harry
four times that week.

38:08.122 --> 38:11.454
Okay. Wedding crunch time.
We need to get really serious here.

38:12.825 --> 38:15.591
Okay, not now.
I just got an e-mail from our contractor.

38:15.763 --> 38:18.390
He's pushed the move-in date yet again.

38:18.565 --> 38:20.464
- I gotta write this guy and...
- No, no, no.

38:20.634 --> 38:24.433
No. Wedding before contractor, all right?

38:24.606 --> 38:29.302
Unless you're planning to invite him,
which would make the guest list 201.

38:31.043 --> 38:34.068
Two hundred?
Jesus, Carrie, it went up again?

38:34.247 --> 38:37.239
- It's the dress.
- You said 75 people.

38:38.416 --> 38:41.146
How can I explain this?

38:42.923 --> 38:44.514
Look...

38:44.991 --> 38:46.959
...you play poker, right?

38:47.127 --> 38:49.186
Well, the dress upped the ante.

38:51.332 --> 38:52.764
Hey.

38:54.501 --> 38:57.469
How you doing on your vows?

38:57.637 --> 39:02.301
A reminder. You'll be saying these in front
of a lot of people, so the pressure is on.

39:02.475 --> 39:04.374
All right, up. I have to finish this. Up.

39:04.544 --> 39:06.205
- Hey.
- I don't have time for this.

39:06.378 --> 39:10.839
- You're not taking it seriously.
- No, no, I'm not. It is a circus.

39:15.522 --> 39:17.386
Two hundred people?

39:17.557 --> 39:19.821
Page Six?

39:23.428 --> 39:28.059
This is my third marriage.
How do you think that makes me look?

39:35.607 --> 39:39.670
I didn't know that was even an issue.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.711
So why didn't you say anything sooner?

39:47.621 --> 39:51.351
- You wanted all of this.
- Well, yeah.

39:51.859 --> 39:54.088
- But don't you want...?
- I want you.

39:54.395 --> 39:55.885
That's what I want.

39:57.730 --> 40:00.494
I could have just gone down to city hall.

40:20.286 --> 40:23.119
I think it's too late for city hall now.

40:24.325 --> 40:27.317
Well, no, I wasn't suggesting that...

40:27.494 --> 40:28.791
I was just saying.

40:31.664 --> 40:34.565
See, that's the face...

40:34.735 --> 40:37.795
...I've been trying to avoid.

40:38.672 --> 40:40.401
Come here.

40:46.847 --> 40:49.644
You're a great man-friend.

40:53.153 --> 40:57.851
And soon,
it was the night before the big day.

41:00.027 --> 41:02.051
There they are.

41:20.214 --> 41:23.182
Now, I know it's tradition
at the rehearsal dinner...

41:23.350 --> 41:28.151
...for the maid of honor to reveal
embarrassing things about the bride.

41:29.856 --> 41:33.188
But in our group, we never kiss and tell.

41:34.496 --> 41:38.487
- So I'd like to make a toast to the groom.
- There's a word he's heard before.

41:42.201 --> 41:44.830
- Who's that guy again?
- Karl. He's a partner at the firm.

41:45.005 --> 41:46.028
Karl's kind of a jerk.

41:46.207 --> 41:48.264
You know what they say,
three time's a charm.

41:48.441 --> 41:50.671
Hey, dickwad, I'm speaking.

41:53.147 --> 41:56.014
- Yeah, Samantha.
- Yeah.

41:58.351 --> 42:02.788
Now, there were times when we had
our doubts about this gorgeous man.

42:02.956 --> 42:07.415
But after careful observation
over the last hundred years...

42:07.594 --> 42:09.720
...my doubts are over.

42:09.897 --> 42:12.889
So here's to the groom...

42:13.067 --> 42:16.400
...a man who finally got "Carrie-d" away.

42:16.571 --> 42:18.628
Aww.

42:18.805 --> 42:20.067
Here's hoping, John.

42:20.373 --> 42:22.501
That guy is a jackass. Here.

42:22.677 --> 42:24.575
- Cheers.
- That was really nice. Thank you.

42:24.744 --> 42:26.871
There's nothing like
an illegal Cuban cigar...

42:27.047 --> 42:29.606
...after dinner, huh?
Exactly.

42:29.783 --> 42:31.875
So that was quite a toast, Samantha.

42:32.052 --> 42:33.314
Well, you're quite a guy.

42:33.520 --> 42:35.248
Oh, my God, there's a cab.
Oh, yeah.

42:35.423 --> 42:37.413
- Hey, buddy, hold on.
- Get it.

42:39.360 --> 42:40.487
Steve.

42:41.196 --> 42:44.891
- I don't wanna bother you all.
- You're not bothering us.

42:46.334 --> 42:47.995
But...

42:48.670 --> 42:51.297
...I need to talk to Miranda.

42:51.905 --> 42:54.396
Samantha, could you ask her
to come out?

42:54.574 --> 42:56.873
I don't wanna go in. It's a party and all.

42:57.811 --> 42:59.175
Sure.

43:03.550 --> 43:06.884
Hey. I haven't talked to you all night.

43:07.055 --> 43:08.613
Steve's here.

43:12.426 --> 43:15.191
They're not poodles.
You know what I mean.

43:15.764 --> 43:19.597
Hey, guys. Would you give us...?

43:20.100 --> 43:22.330
Yeah, sure, going in.

43:25.572 --> 43:27.335
You're all right?

43:35.116 --> 43:38.950
You didn't leave me any choice.
You won't return my calls.

43:39.120 --> 43:42.180
You only talk to me in front of the baby
and I can't say anything.

43:42.357 --> 43:45.723
What could you possibly have to say
that could make it any better?

43:46.194 --> 43:51.290
- Please. It was just that one time.
- You broke us!

43:51.466 --> 43:54.399
You broke us. What we had is broken.

43:56.069 --> 43:57.730
What the fuck is happening?

44:04.979 --> 44:07.708
I changed who I was for you.

44:14.354 --> 44:15.821
Hey.

44:16.890 --> 44:19.858
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

44:20.428 --> 44:25.295
You two are crazy to get married.
Marriage ruins everything.

44:36.044 --> 44:40.845
Hey. There you are.
I thought you'd skipped out on me.

44:41.016 --> 44:42.142
No.

44:42.317 --> 44:45.183
Well, the all-gal sleepover's
about to commence.

44:51.058 --> 44:53.687
Hey, is everything okay?

44:53.863 --> 44:56.421
Yeah. I'm just tired, I guess.

44:56.598 --> 44:58.897
All right. Well, go home and go to sleep.

44:59.068 --> 45:01.968
But first give me a kiss good night
and make it a good one...

45:02.304 --> 45:06.604
...because it's the last single-girl kiss.

45:09.043 --> 45:13.069
- I always knew she would marry Big.
- Oh, you did not.

45:13.248 --> 45:15.580
- That's crazy.
- Yes, I did.

45:15.749 --> 45:20.119
After every breakup I secretly thought,
"Nope. They belong together. "

45:20.288 --> 45:22.221
You thought that
after the second breakup?

45:22.389 --> 45:24.084
- Yup.
- After the fifteenth?

45:24.259 --> 45:27.228
Ha-ha. That's hilarious.
We broke up a lot.

45:27.395 --> 45:30.922
Yeah, but after the breakups
comes the hot make-up sex.

45:34.002 --> 45:37.459
Hey, you wanna get that? Open up.

45:38.540 --> 45:40.201
- Now say something.
- Sex.

45:44.546 --> 45:47.014
Are you sure she's not my child?

45:47.681 --> 45:49.842
- Hello?
- It's me.

45:50.019 --> 45:52.417
Oh, my God, did you just hear Lily?

45:52.586 --> 45:55.350
- I need to talk.
- What?

45:55.521 --> 46:01.189
I'm sitting here
trying to write these vows and...

46:02.331 --> 46:04.627
Is this something we really wanna do?

46:05.968 --> 46:09.403
Hey, you know what? You guys, it's Big.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna take it.

46:10.204 --> 46:13.537
Get some sleep, groomie.

46:17.545 --> 46:20.514
- What's the matter?
- It's just...

46:20.847 --> 46:24.079
...everything is great as it is.

46:24.987 --> 46:27.820
- I don't wanna screw it up.
- You won't.

46:27.990 --> 46:30.287
I screwed it up twice before.

46:31.560 --> 46:33.256
Here's the thing.

46:33.762 --> 46:39.131
This is me you're marrying tomorrow.
Me. It's nobody else.

46:40.035 --> 46:43.266
- Yeah?
- And I'm marrying you.

46:43.438 --> 46:44.962
It's me and you.

46:45.374 --> 46:48.308
And do you wanna hear
the great news there?

46:48.476 --> 46:49.499
Yeah.

46:49.678 --> 46:52.510
We've both already done
everything we can to screw it up.

46:54.249 --> 46:57.876
- Is that a smile I'm hearing?
- Yeah.

46:58.053 --> 47:02.489
It sounds to me like you've got
a bit of writer's block on the vow front.

47:02.658 --> 47:03.785
Yeah.

47:03.959 --> 47:06.825
And I find, you know,
as a professional writer...

47:06.996 --> 47:10.896
...that it's best to just, you know...

47:11.066 --> 47:14.694
...just stop thinking about it so much
and go to bed.

47:14.870 --> 47:16.928
And in the morning...

47:17.104 --> 47:20.336
- You'll know what to do.
- Exactly.

47:20.510 --> 47:23.638
And if not, then just write this:

47:23.813 --> 47:25.438
I will love you.

47:25.614 --> 47:27.708
Simple, to the point...

47:27.883 --> 47:32.182
...and I swear I won't even
try to take credit for it.

47:34.123 --> 47:36.615
So you're gonna go to bed now, right?

47:37.427 --> 47:40.986
Okay. Good night.

47:41.162 --> 47:44.221
I'll see you tomorrow. And hey...

47:45.433 --> 47:47.527
...it's me and you.

48:21.503 --> 48:23.198
Now, there's a bride.

48:29.279 --> 48:31.405
Before we leave, we're gonna
pick up our flowers, right, girls?

48:32.981 --> 48:35.848
Miranda, you're gonna have the dahlias.
Samantha, you have the roses.

48:36.019 --> 48:39.681
- And Charlotte...
We can take care of it.

48:40.889 --> 48:42.584
Hello?

48:43.393 --> 48:46.155
Could you put Carrie
on the phone, please?

48:47.694 --> 48:48.958
Hello?

48:54.771 --> 48:57.705
Who let the dogs out?
Get these dogs out of here!

48:57.874 --> 49:01.537
That's all we need is the lift of a leg
on the train of a dress.

49:01.710 --> 49:04.075
Could you open this door, please?

49:04.246 --> 49:07.114
- Wait, wait, hold it.
I'm trying to find out...

49:07.284 --> 49:08.579
- Oh, my God.
Hey.

49:08.752 --> 49:10.946
- The girls are in this car.
- All of us together?

49:11.119 --> 49:14.088
All of you together.
Okay? Come on, lift it up. Let's go.

49:14.255 --> 49:16.122
Hey, it's Carrie. Leave me a message.

49:16.293 --> 49:20.285
- See you then. Bye-bye.
Just so beautiful.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.127
Blue.
Yes, sir.

49:26.302 --> 49:29.600
- Red and black.
Okay, I'll see you there.

49:29.772 --> 49:31.865
- Where's black?
- Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming.

49:32.041 --> 49:33.974
- You're following the red.
- I'm coming.

49:34.144 --> 49:36.611
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

49:36.780 --> 49:38.939
- Ready?
- Yeah, okay, you're in.

49:39.114 --> 49:40.307
Okay.

49:40.481 --> 49:44.577
There's the bride. Look, she's dressed
like a princess, do you see?

49:44.752 --> 49:46.812
- Can you hold that?
- Oh, yes.

49:46.989 --> 49:48.423
Thank you. Okay.

49:49.092 --> 49:51.024
Come on, scootch over.

49:53.496 --> 49:56.556
It's like pushing a cream puff
through a keyhole.

49:56.732 --> 49:57.926
See you at the library.

49:58.101 --> 50:01.537
- Hey, it's Carrie. Leave me a message.
- Why haven't you called me back?

50:01.704 --> 50:05.366
Look, I really need to talk to you.
Call me as soon as you get this.

50:07.842 --> 50:10.903
No more wedding guests on these stairs,
understand? Bridal party only.

50:11.079 --> 50:12.308
Got it.

50:13.716 --> 50:16.149
We've got a problem. They're not here.

50:16.318 --> 50:19.116
- They're probably stuck in traffic.
- Both of them?

50:25.395 --> 50:30.356
- Hey, it's Carrie. Leave me a message.
- I can't go in without you.

50:32.001 --> 50:33.593
Baby...

50:35.104 --> 50:40.005
...this whole bride-and-groom thing
has really got me thrown.

50:44.646 --> 50:47.481
I need to know that it's still us.

50:47.651 --> 50:51.644
Just you and me. Like you said.

50:56.926 --> 50:58.723
I was putting it on.
I know.

50:58.894 --> 51:00.258
Good job. Beautiful.

51:01.631 --> 51:04.863
Come on, baby.
Turn around, let me see you.

51:07.570 --> 51:10.232
You look so beautiful.

51:19.383 --> 51:20.542
It looks beautiful.

51:20.717 --> 51:22.581
It really does. It looks so beautiful.

51:23.619 --> 51:25.143
Oh, look at Mommy, here they come.

51:25.322 --> 51:26.583
Easy does it.
We're here.

51:26.756 --> 51:29.849
The traffic was the worst.
57th Street was just...

51:30.026 --> 51:33.895
- It's okay.
Hello. You guys look great.

51:36.164 --> 51:39.963
- Okay, honey, let's go upstairs.
Ready. We're ready.

51:41.504 --> 51:43.266
He's not here.

51:43.840 --> 51:45.569
- Who's not here?
- The groom.

51:46.343 --> 51:47.365
What's happening?

51:49.045 --> 51:53.175
- Big's not here.
- But we're 25 minutes late.

51:53.350 --> 51:55.476
Well, did anybody call him?

51:58.721 --> 52:02.213
Well, give me a phone.
Somebody give me a phone.

52:06.395 --> 52:09.330
- All right, I don't know how to work this.
- Here, sweetie.

52:09.499 --> 52:11.057
Thank you.

52:21.644 --> 52:25.307
Hey, you know what?
Let me just look at your tie for a minute.

52:25.516 --> 52:27.347
Hello.
- Are you okay?

52:27.518 --> 52:28.917
I've been calling for an hour.

52:29.086 --> 52:32.577
- Why haven't you been answering?
- Because I don't know where my phone is.

52:34.057 --> 52:35.820
So, what's going on? Where are you?

52:36.260 --> 52:39.490
I was out front. I just left.

52:43.167 --> 52:44.793
I can't do this.

52:50.039 --> 52:51.802
Oh, my God.

52:56.312 --> 52:58.507
Carrie? Carrie.

53:01.784 --> 53:05.777
- He's not coming. Oh, my God.
- What do you mean, "He's not coming"?

53:08.725 --> 53:10.625
Get me out of here.

53:10.793 --> 53:12.351
- Get me out of here!
- Go, go, go.

53:12.530 --> 53:15.657
- You take her, I'll take care of all of this.
All right, all right.

53:15.833 --> 53:17.265
Here we go.

53:39.088 --> 53:41.489
What the fuck am I doing?
Turn around, go back.

53:41.659 --> 53:43.181
It's a one-way street.

53:43.360 --> 53:45.987
By the time we go around the block,
she'll be gone.

53:46.162 --> 53:48.461
There's no one behind us. Turn around.

53:56.172 --> 53:59.164
- I think this is them.
- Pull over. Pull over.

54:00.611 --> 54:02.168
Carrie.

54:09.319 --> 54:13.278
Carrie. I freaked out for a minute,
but I'm ready now.

54:15.627 --> 54:17.650
Oh, God.

54:19.864 --> 54:23.162
I knew
you would do this! I knew it!

54:23.333 --> 54:26.302
- Carrie, I'm sorry.
- I am humiliated!

54:26.470 --> 54:29.064
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry, Carrie.

54:29.239 --> 54:30.330
Come on. Come on.

54:31.708 --> 54:35.474
- Carrie, wait, I'm sorry. Carrie...
- No! No!

54:36.780 --> 54:38.508
Come on, we're gonna get in the car.

54:39.416 --> 54:41.749
It's all right, it's all right.

55:03.574 --> 55:05.098
Let's go, man. Move it.

55:34.037 --> 55:37.063
I thought I would still be in extreme pain.

55:40.277 --> 55:42.245
I feel nothing.

55:45.016 --> 55:47.348
I'd like some more nothing.

55:53.323 --> 55:55.017
Yes, I'm still jilted.

55:56.994 --> 56:00.394
What the hell got into him?
He was perfectly fine at the dinner.

56:01.465 --> 56:03.956
I knew it when he called last night.

56:04.501 --> 56:07.401
- I could tell.
- Then why didn't you say anything?

56:09.507 --> 56:12.340
I didn't wanna believe it. I di...

56:12.511 --> 56:15.741
I didn't even wanna say it out loud.

56:18.282 --> 56:21.376
- Now I have nowhere to live.
- You'll stay here.

56:21.553 --> 56:22.813
Forever.

56:23.921 --> 56:26.446
Maybe you should eat something.

56:27.624 --> 56:29.922
- Anyone? Hungry?
- No.

56:31.828 --> 56:34.991
I can never go back there again.
How am I gonna get my clothes?

56:35.165 --> 56:39.329
Oh, honey, I can hire people to do all that.
Anything you need.

56:40.071 --> 56:41.266
A hit man?

56:43.274 --> 56:46.139
I have nothing to wear
but a wedding gown.

56:46.910 --> 56:49.573
You have your honeymoon clothes here.

56:50.748 --> 56:53.078
Well, there's the silver lining.

56:54.985 --> 56:59.115
A honeymoon
at a romantic Mexican resort...

56:59.289 --> 57:01.223
...that's prepaid on my credit card...

57:01.391 --> 57:03.859
...because I wanted to surprise
the man who jilted me.

57:04.027 --> 57:05.688
I can get you out of that.

57:05.862 --> 57:08.764
Worse comes to worse,
I'll say there was a death or something.

57:08.933 --> 57:10.661
Wasn't there?

57:14.339 --> 57:17.798
Keep those eyes closed.
Keep them closed.

57:32.290 --> 57:33.416
Charlotte.

57:33.591 --> 57:35.387
Come here. Come here.

57:38.428 --> 57:41.225
I did something really bad, I think.

57:41.933 --> 57:44.767
I said something to Big
at the rehearsal dinner.

57:46.305 --> 57:47.463
What do you mean?

57:47.639 --> 57:51.130
It was right after Steve showed up.
I was upset.

57:51.309 --> 57:55.039
Big came over to me,
and I said something like:

57:55.880 --> 57:57.938
"You're crazy to get married. "

57:58.750 --> 58:00.649
It just came out.

58:00.818 --> 58:04.778
- Do you think it's totally the reason?
- No.

58:04.956 --> 58:07.948
Big has been weird
about marriage for years.

58:10.130 --> 58:13.621
- I keep thinking I should tell Carrie.
- No, no, no.

58:13.798 --> 58:17.096
This is a bad time to even mention it.

58:18.168 --> 58:22.901
No, no, no. Find another time later.

58:23.074 --> 58:24.062
Uh-huh.

58:24.243 --> 58:28.178
Well, it turns out, I couldn't get her
out of the honeymoon, but I got us in.

58:28.780 --> 58:32.080
- What?
- I just booked us three seats on the flight.

58:32.250 --> 58:34.946
Mexico, here we come.

58:35.320 --> 58:38.154
I can't go to Mexico. I have a job.

58:46.365 --> 58:49.355
Jerrod. Smith Jerrod, with a J.

58:49.534 --> 58:53.401
That's right. Great, thank you.

58:54.739 --> 58:58.698
- Make sure that the car is there...
- We're here, I'll call you back later.

59:01.779 --> 59:02.803
Welcome to Mexico.

59:08.452 --> 59:10.011
Do you have wi-fi? Thanks.

59:13.759 --> 59:16.989
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
I'm waiting for a Mr. And Mrs. Preston.

59:17.162 --> 59:21.325
Honey, you'll be waiting a long time.
We'll talk.

59:27.772 --> 59:30.672
This will kill her.

59:32.611 --> 59:34.670
- Where is she?
- In the powder room.

59:34.847 --> 59:37.575
- Well, let's look around.
- Yeah.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.831
And this is a master suite.

01:00:39.243 --> 01:00:41.177
Oh, my God.

01:00:41.879 --> 01:00:43.541
Here.

01:00:43.714 --> 01:00:45.546
You get that side.

01:00:47.387 --> 01:00:49.547
Where are we gonna put these?

01:00:50.454 --> 01:00:54.515
Here. No more honeymoon stuff.
This is very important.

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:02.629
Here she comes.

01:01:15.914 --> 01:01:17.641
It's going to be a gorgeous sunset.

01:01:19.852 --> 01:01:21.114
Close the shutters.

01:01:28.293 --> 01:01:29.555
All of them.

01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:52.376
Morning.

01:01:54.754 --> 01:01:56.244
Did I dream it?

01:02:10.202 --> 01:02:11.999
Carrie?

01:02:12.938 --> 01:02:15.566
It's dinnertime. You slept the whole day.

01:02:16.708 --> 01:02:18.335
So?

01:02:31.357 --> 01:02:35.793
Honey? You have to eat a little breakfast.

01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:38.989
I'm tired.

01:02:39.164 --> 01:02:42.599
Well, eat something,
then you can go back to sleep.

01:03:17.235 --> 01:03:19.568
- Oh, thank you, Paulo.
- Sure.

01:03:22.776 --> 01:03:27.643
With all this gorgeous fresh food, you're
gonna eat that pudding crap the entire trip?

01:03:27.814 --> 01:03:30.373
It's the only thing in the pantry
that's totally safe.

01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:34.315
See? "Made in Poughkeepsie. "
I didn't wanna chance it.

01:03:34.488 --> 01:03:36.251
It's a five-star resort.

01:03:36.622 --> 01:03:38.613
It's Mexico.

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:48.328
Carrie.

01:03:50.937 --> 01:03:52.028
Is there coffee?

01:03:53.105 --> 01:03:55.836
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

01:04:02.949 --> 01:04:05.348
The sun feels nice.

01:04:09.187 --> 01:04:11.315
Jesus, honey, wax much?

01:04:11.691 --> 01:04:14.660
What? I didn't know
I was gonna be wearing a bathing suit.

01:04:15.028 --> 01:04:17.791
- What are you talking about?
- I forgot to wax.

01:04:17.963 --> 01:04:21.729
- Since when, 1998?
I've had other things on my mind.

01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:24.496
I could be on death row
and not have that situation.

01:04:24.672 --> 01:04:27.764
Well, when you're married,
you have a different set of priorities.

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:29.532
Oh, honey, don't blame marriage.

01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:32.576
This one's married and
she's not growing a national forest.

01:04:32.746 --> 01:04:36.646
How do you even cross your legs?
Let me make you a spa appointment.

01:04:36.816 --> 01:04:39.411
Any thicker,
and you won't be able to find it.

01:04:41.754 --> 01:04:43.721
So, what, it's my fault?

01:04:43.891 --> 01:04:47.018
I let the sex go out of my marriage.
I deserve what I got?

01:04:47.193 --> 01:04:50.891
- Thanks for understanding.
- Honey, I'm sorry. That's not what I...

01:04:51.065 --> 01:04:52.690
I'm fine.

01:05:04.011 --> 01:05:06.639
Hey, let's go down to the hotel
for dinner tonight.

01:05:06.815 --> 01:05:08.577
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:05:08.748 --> 01:05:11.445
I gotta do something
to pull me out of my "Mexi-coma. "

01:05:11.617 --> 01:05:14.210
Oh, honey, you made a little joke.

01:05:14.387 --> 01:05:16.321
Good for you.

01:05:17.157 --> 01:05:18.316
Yeah.

01:05:34.675 --> 01:05:38.805
- My name is Felix, I'll be your server.
- Felix, we'll start with cuatro margaritas.

01:05:38.979 --> 01:05:41.209
Oh, no, I'm not drinking.
Just bottled water.

01:05:41.379 --> 01:05:43.610
- I'll drink hers.
- May I have your room numbers?

01:05:45.051 --> 01:05:48.987
We're staying in one of the private houses.
Uh, number 3.

01:05:49.590 --> 01:05:50.749
Very good, Mrs. Preston.

01:05:55.596 --> 01:05:57.257
That was like taking a bullet.

01:06:02.504 --> 01:06:05.267
Charlotte has pudding in her Prada.

01:06:11.613 --> 01:06:14.079
- Will I ever laugh again?
- Yes.

01:06:14.248 --> 01:06:17.944
- When?
- When something is really, really funny.

01:06:20.922 --> 01:06:24.720
Thank God for that mariachi band
or I'd be able to hear my own thoughts.

01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.659
Fabulous. And keep them coming.

01:06:30.296 --> 01:06:31.661
Thanks.

01:06:37.403 --> 01:06:38.837
Thank you.

01:06:44.877 --> 01:06:47.607
He couldn't get out of the car.

01:06:48.082 --> 01:06:51.517
After 10 years
of what he already put me through...

01:06:51.685 --> 01:06:55.849
...he couldn't make the effort
and get out of the car.

01:06:56.157 --> 01:06:57.988
I made the effort.

01:06:58.157 --> 01:06:59.955
I put a bird on my head.

01:07:00.127 --> 01:07:01.650
- Is that what that was?
- Yeah.

01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:04.354
- I thought it was feathers.
- It was a bird.

01:07:04.531 --> 01:07:07.864
- It was beautiful.
Beautiful.

01:07:08.268 --> 01:07:10.394
He's a bad guy.

01:07:11.471 --> 01:07:13.664
Always was.

01:07:13.841 --> 01:07:17.743
- Bad guys do bad things.
- And good guys do bad things.

01:07:17.912 --> 01:07:20.846
The good guys screw you
and the bad guys screw you.

01:07:21.014 --> 01:07:23.073
The rest of them
don't know how to screw you.

01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:26.377
- Trust me, I've done the legwork.
After everything I know...

01:07:26.553 --> 01:07:30.957
...after 20 years of
everything we've learned...

01:07:31.125 --> 01:07:35.025
...I threw it all away for the thrill of
putting his name on the honeymoon suite.

01:07:36.496 --> 01:07:38.760
If I met me now, I wouldn't know me.

01:07:40.234 --> 01:07:42.701
As long as we're going down this road...

01:07:42.871 --> 01:07:47.329
...I can't believe
that my life revolves around a man.

01:07:47.507 --> 01:07:49.839
On what planet
did I allow that to happen?

01:07:50.011 --> 01:07:51.070
But you love him.

01:07:51.246 --> 01:07:54.942
Does that mean saying his name
50 times more a day than I say my own?

01:07:55.682 --> 01:07:59.516
Does it mean worrying about him
and his needs before me and mine?

01:07:59.686 --> 01:08:02.052
Is it all about the other person?
Is that love?

01:08:02.222 --> 01:08:05.588
- No, that's marriage.
- Even this ring.

01:08:05.759 --> 01:08:07.250
I wanted to buy this for myself.

01:08:07.428 --> 01:08:09.690
That meant something to me,
to be able to do that.

01:08:09.863 --> 01:08:13.458
- And then he buys it for me.
- Because he knew how much you loved it.

01:08:13.634 --> 01:08:17.569
Yes, but now every time I look down at it,
I see him not me.

01:08:19.908 --> 01:08:22.432
- Is every...?
- We'll take another round.

01:08:22.743 --> 01:08:25.769
- Another?
- Relax. We're on vacation.

01:08:25.948 --> 01:08:27.710
Technically, we're on my honeymoon.

01:08:27.881 --> 01:08:30.782
No, I think we're on their honeymoon.

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:34.720
Yeah, it's all so hot three days in.

01:08:42.263 --> 01:08:45.756
"Mailbox full. " Yeah, I'll bet it is.

01:08:45.933 --> 01:08:48.232
- There's no time like the present.
No.

01:08:49.136 --> 01:08:50.965
I'm not ready to face it all yet.

01:08:51.705 --> 01:08:54.935
Hey. I'm going for a run
and then to the gym for Pilates.

01:08:55.108 --> 01:08:57.133
Anybody wanna...?

01:08:58.412 --> 01:09:00.675
- Hi.
- Hey, good news.

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:02.906
I got an e-mail
from your buyer's attorney.

01:09:03.084 --> 01:09:06.679
They're willing to sell you back
your old apartment at the escalated price...

01:09:06.854 --> 01:09:09.719
...and "are willing to vacate
by the time you return...

01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:11.917
...pending an additional financial offer. "

01:09:12.093 --> 01:09:15.756
Well, apparently you can go home again,
but it'll cost you.

01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:18.625
- Let's work on getting your things there.
Wow...

01:09:19.033 --> 01:09:21.696
...you two could rule the world.

01:09:22.403 --> 01:09:24.928
After her workout,
Charlotte couldn't help but think...

01:09:25.106 --> 01:09:27.004
...how truly blessed she was.

01:09:27.174 --> 01:09:30.906
This week had made her feel more grateful
than ever for her happy marriage.

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:35.377
And just for a second, while picturing
her loved ones at home in New York...

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:39.750
...she forgot where she was
and opened her mouth.

01:10:02.142 --> 01:10:03.165
Hello, miss.

01:10:07.347 --> 01:10:09.543
- Have you had that happen?
Not recently.

01:10:09.717 --> 01:10:11.445
Sweetie, what's...?

01:10:11.618 --> 01:10:13.518
It's locked, she's mopping.

01:10:13.688 --> 01:10:15.280
Try the...

01:10:24.165 --> 01:10:26.565
- Did you just...?
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

01:10:26.734 --> 01:10:28.724
And just like that...

01:10:28.903 --> 01:10:30.961
...Charlotte "Poughkeepsied"
in her pants.

01:10:33.174 --> 01:10:36.700
Oh, my God.

01:10:40.213 --> 01:10:41.545
Miranda was right.

01:10:41.717 --> 01:10:46.585
When something was really,
really funny, I laughed.

01:10:47.622 --> 01:10:49.556
Oh, my God.

01:11:14.349 --> 01:11:15.712
First message:

01:11:15.885 --> 01:11:20.980
Received Saturday,
September 20th, 12:30 p. m.

01:11:21.156 --> 01:11:24.590
Carrie, call me.
I need to talk to you before...

01:12:16.611 --> 01:12:20.479
There was no better time I could think of
to hire an assistant.

01:12:20.649 --> 01:12:24.106
Um, no. I do not lift boxes.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:29.351
Yeah, definitely, no.
I would love a career in fashion.

01:12:29.524 --> 01:12:31.492
Oh.

01:12:32.527 --> 01:12:34.393
This is not nonfat.

01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:36.161
Oh.

01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:40.359
I love your books. Your shit's brilliant.

01:12:40.536 --> 01:12:42.127
Cathy?

01:12:43.138 --> 01:12:45.833
- You seem drunk.
- Little bit.

01:12:46.007 --> 01:12:47.839
Never made it to bed last night.

01:12:48.011 --> 01:12:50.374
But I type like a motherfucker!

01:12:50.546 --> 01:12:52.536
I have a degree in finance
from Princeton...

01:12:52.714 --> 01:12:55.376
...and I've been assistant to a V.P.
At Merrill Lynch.

01:12:55.551 --> 01:13:00.681
That's impressive. And, Paul,
why do you think you're right for this job?

01:13:08.497 --> 01:13:13.161
- So you're from St. Louis?
- That's right. Louise from St. Louis.

01:13:13.335 --> 01:13:15.235
And you have a degree
in computer science?

01:13:15.405 --> 01:13:18.395
- Yes, that's correct.
- Well, good for you. I can barely text.

01:13:20.442 --> 01:13:24.139
- Have you ever been a personal assistant?
- No, but I'm the oldest of six kids...

01:13:24.313 --> 01:13:26.506
...so I'm sure I can handle
anything you got.

01:13:26.683 --> 01:13:29.515
- Wow. Six kids, what's that like?
- Crowded.

01:13:29.952 --> 01:13:33.080
I had to move to New York just to
get some room. Where did I end up?

01:13:33.257 --> 01:13:35.883
In a one-bedroom apartment
with three roommates.

01:13:36.391 --> 01:13:39.553
Well, aside from the space issue,
why'd you move to New York?

01:13:41.496 --> 01:13:42.758
To fall in love.

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:47.665
- What? That's corny, right?
- No.

01:13:47.836 --> 01:13:51.795
No, no, it's... It's just very honest.

01:13:52.841 --> 01:13:57.038
I don't think that I've heard
anybody say that in a very long time.

01:13:57.578 --> 01:13:58.910
Well...

01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:04.182
So Louise from St. Louis,
I just have one more question.

01:14:04.354 --> 01:14:05.378
Okay.

01:14:05.588 --> 01:14:07.920
How does an unemployed girl
with three roommates...

01:14:08.091 --> 01:14:10.615
...afford the Patchwork Denim Bowley
Louis Vuitton bag?

01:14:10.994 --> 01:14:15.396
It's rented. Bag Borrow or Steal?
It's like Netflix for purses.

01:14:15.564 --> 01:14:19.330
- How can I not know about this?
- Girl, stick with me. I'll hook you up.

01:14:24.339 --> 01:14:27.399
And did she hook me up.

01:14:27.944 --> 01:14:31.937
Hi. This is Louise.
I'm calling for Carrie Bradshaw.

01:14:32.582 --> 01:14:36.643
Yes, she received your invitation,
but she will be unable to attend.

01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:38.447
Thank you.

01:14:42.524 --> 01:14:44.582
Put that over there.

01:14:45.695 --> 01:14:47.560
After only three days...

01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:52.358
...I began to think of her
as Saint Louise from St. Louis.

01:14:53.103 --> 01:14:55.295
Ain't nothing in there for you.

01:14:56.205 --> 01:14:59.299
And as I moved back
into my old apartment...

01:14:59.475 --> 01:15:02.443
...Miranda searched for a new one,
downtown.

01:15:02.611 --> 01:15:05.581
You see the Chinese writing?
Yeah.

01:15:05.749 --> 01:15:08.979
New York magazine says this is
the new up-and-coming neighborhood.

01:15:09.951 --> 01:15:12.944
- Okay, maybe down that way?
- Maybe you come home.

01:15:14.424 --> 01:15:17.051
Look, white guy with a baby.

01:15:17.427 --> 01:15:20.883
Wherever he's going,
that's where we need to be.

01:15:21.663 --> 01:15:23.154
Come on.

01:15:28.571 --> 01:15:33.200
I lived here before.
This used to be all-Ukrainian area.

01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:35.104
A U-Haul.

01:15:35.845 --> 01:15:37.242
Coming or going?

01:15:37.913 --> 01:15:40.973
- Going. Oh, boy. I'm gonna check it out.
- Okay.

01:15:41.151 --> 01:15:42.139
Wait down here, okay?

01:15:43.786 --> 01:15:44.980
Okay.

01:15:45.154 --> 01:15:47.520
Hi. Do you have an apartment?
Stay, stay, stay.

01:16:01.838 --> 01:16:06.034
And there in old Ukrainia,
Miranda found her new apartment.

01:16:06.208 --> 01:16:08.974
- Hi. I'm interested in the apartment upstairs.
Yeah.

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:13.247
"And there they remained
for the rest of their days...

01:16:13.415 --> 01:16:15.406
...for the birds
were constantly on guard...

01:16:15.584 --> 01:16:19.020
...and the women could not so much
as step one foot out the door.

01:16:19.188 --> 01:16:23.716
And Cinderella and the prince
lived happily ever after. "

01:16:30.267 --> 01:16:33.758
You know that this is just a fairy tale,
right, sweetheart?

01:16:33.937 --> 01:16:37.269
I mean, things don't always
happen like this in real life.

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:42.239
- I just think you should know that now.
- Again.

01:16:43.414 --> 01:16:45.245
And another one bites the dust.

01:16:45.416 --> 01:16:47.405
- Hi.
Hi.

01:16:47.884 --> 01:16:49.850
Mommy's home.

01:16:50.452 --> 01:16:52.852
Thanks for watching Lily
while I went to the doctor.

01:16:53.021 --> 01:16:57.118
- Oh, sure. Everything okay?
- Mm-hm.

01:16:57.828 --> 01:17:01.730
- I'm pregnant.
- How?

01:17:01.898 --> 01:17:06.562
You know how people always say
that when you stop trying, it can happen?

01:17:06.737 --> 01:17:10.069
And my doctor says that she knows
other couples who have adopted...

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.401
...and then they get pregnant.

01:17:13.043 --> 01:17:16.342
- Sweetie.
- Carrie, I'm pregnant.

01:17:18.148 --> 01:17:21.082
I guess in certain houses,
fairy tales do come true.

01:17:24.434 --> 01:17:26.628
Oh, that was really hot.

01:17:28.005 --> 01:17:32.407
- You seem kind of distant.
- Distant? You're still in me.

01:17:39.650 --> 01:17:44.176
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- When have I ever wanted to talk about it?

01:17:44.353 --> 01:17:47.790
Okay. I'll talk about it.

01:17:47.958 --> 01:17:50.255
Your best friends got screwed over
by their guys.

01:17:50.426 --> 01:17:52.859
How could you not be distant?

01:17:54.664 --> 01:17:56.860
It's more than that.

01:17:58.003 --> 01:18:02.802
Lately, I haven't been feeling
a connection to...

01:18:03.308 --> 01:18:05.104
- What, me?
- No.

01:18:05.642 --> 01:18:11.045
To it, here. I have no real connection
to our life here.

01:18:11.214 --> 01:18:13.911
What life here? Seriously.

01:18:14.084 --> 01:18:15.380
All I do is work...

01:18:15.552 --> 01:18:17.951
...and you run off to New York
every chance you get.

01:18:18.122 --> 01:18:22.387
Well, not every chance I get.
Only for the A-list things.

01:18:22.559 --> 01:18:25.652
And my managing you, it's...
It's getting to be too much.

01:18:25.829 --> 01:18:27.557
I'm starting to resent it.

01:18:27.730 --> 01:18:30.325
For the last two years,
it's been all about you.

01:18:30.502 --> 01:18:33.630
Well, for the first three years,
it was all about you.

01:18:33.805 --> 01:18:36.932
I know. That was so much more fun.

01:18:39.311 --> 01:18:42.473
Well, I won't be coming to New York
for a while.

01:18:42.647 --> 01:18:46.046
We're gonna spend some time
reconnecting on weekends...

01:18:46.215 --> 01:18:48.080
...do the L.A. -couple thing.

01:18:48.252 --> 01:18:50.413
Yeah, hi. Can you put on Samantha?

01:18:51.021 --> 01:18:55.014
Really. At first I was all,
"You can't tell me what I can do. "

01:18:55.192 --> 01:18:57.160
But then I had to admit, he had a point.

01:18:57.394 --> 01:18:59.725
Please deposit another 85 cents.

01:18:59.897 --> 01:19:01.762
Honey, a payphone? Where's your cell?

01:19:01.932 --> 01:19:04.263
At the bottom of the ocean in Mexico.

01:19:04.435 --> 01:19:08.030
- Want me to hook you up with a new one?
- No, not yet. No phone, no calls.

01:19:08.206 --> 01:19:12.300
No calls, no questions.
No questions, no explaining no wedding.

01:19:12.476 --> 01:19:14.875
Plus, it's an excuse
to bust out the gloves.

01:19:15.143 --> 01:19:17.204
Please deposit another 85...

01:19:17.981 --> 01:19:20.882
Carrie Bradshaw's web page is a mess.

01:19:21.051 --> 01:19:23.177
Interesting. So is Carrie Bradshaw.

01:19:24.388 --> 01:19:28.949
Hey, when are we gonna get to the really
important stuff, like unpacking my closet?

01:19:29.126 --> 01:19:32.061
One thing at a time. You ever gonna
answer any of these e-mails?

01:19:32.228 --> 01:19:33.787
- Yes.
- When?

01:19:34.999 --> 01:19:36.761
- Now?
- Okay.

01:19:36.935 --> 01:19:40.461
- Well, I'll read and you tell me what to do.
- Okay.

01:19:40.838 --> 01:19:45.206
Who's john@jjpny. com?

01:19:46.177 --> 01:19:49.704
Oh, shit. That's him, right?

01:20:02.127 --> 01:20:03.149
Delete.

01:20:05.628 --> 01:20:08.960
And isn't there some cyberspace place
that you can send those...

01:20:09.133 --> 01:20:12.534
...so that I never have to see
an e-mail from him ever again?

01:20:13.505 --> 01:20:15.232
Do that, please.

01:20:17.408 --> 01:20:19.933
You sure you wanna end
all communication with him?

01:20:20.111 --> 01:20:21.579
Mm-hm.

01:20:25.683 --> 01:20:28.048
Okay. Great.

01:20:30.588 --> 01:20:32.452
I can't believe you're even dressing up.

01:20:32.623 --> 01:20:36.114
All the parents in Brady's school
dress up. It's fun.

01:20:36.292 --> 01:20:40.457
Fun thought up by a group of non-working
mothers with nothing else to do all day.

01:20:40.632 --> 01:20:45.624
All right, what do they got?
Witch and sexy kitten.

01:20:45.803 --> 01:20:50.138
That's it. The only two choices
for women, witch and sexy kitten.

01:20:50.308 --> 01:20:52.400
You just said a mouthful there, sister.

01:20:52.577 --> 01:20:56.776
Maybe I should wear this and
a briefcase, and go as myself.

01:20:57.749 --> 01:20:59.977
I got an e-mail from Big.

01:21:00.585 --> 01:21:02.313
"I don't know what to say. "

01:21:02.488 --> 01:21:07.425
- Uh, then don't send an e-mail.
- What were you expecting?

01:21:08.192 --> 01:21:11.559
And in the subject box, two words:

01:21:11.728 --> 01:21:14.993
- "I'm sorry. "
- Ugh.

01:21:15.365 --> 01:21:17.493
Steve is all about the "I'm sorry. "

01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:20.398
"I'm sorry" e-mails,
"I'm sorry" voice mails...

01:21:20.572 --> 01:21:23.096
..."I'm sorry" flowers, "I'm sorry" cards.

01:21:23.274 --> 01:21:27.210
How about, don't do anything
to be "I'm sorry" for?

01:21:27.378 --> 01:21:29.743
Well, maybe he's sorry.

01:21:29.913 --> 01:21:32.245
Well, maybe so is Big.

01:21:32.584 --> 01:21:33.811
Point taken.

01:21:36.221 --> 01:21:37.709
Hey, you're scaring the women.

01:21:37.889 --> 01:21:41.688
It's gonna take a little more than that
to scare me after what I've been through.

01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:46.856
I still cannot believe this happened to me.
I mean, I... I know it happened.

01:21:47.031 --> 01:21:52.162
But I just... I can't believe it happened.

01:21:53.505 --> 01:21:59.374
I lay awake at night going over
every detail of that last week in my head.

01:22:00.179 --> 01:22:05.615
Carrie, there's a detail about that last week
I've been meaning to tell you.

01:22:05.782 --> 01:22:08.876
- At the rehearsal dinner...
- And then I saw it.

01:22:09.052 --> 01:22:13.352
The only thing scary enough to scare me
after what I'd been through.

01:22:13.524 --> 01:22:16.425
You look great.
You look amazing. So that's the worst of it.

01:22:16.595 --> 01:22:17.787
Wait, wait, wait.

01:22:19.164 --> 01:22:21.221
What does it say there
in the editor's note?

01:22:21.399 --> 01:22:24.629
"The wedding of Carrie Bradshaw
and John James Preston was canceled...

01:22:24.801 --> 01:22:27.997
...as this issue went to press.
Bradshaw is... "

01:22:30.241 --> 01:22:32.435
Bradshaw is what?

01:22:33.877 --> 01:22:34.901
Wait...

01:22:37.148 --> 01:22:41.140
"Bradshaw is still single
and living in New York City. "

01:22:48.593 --> 01:22:50.788
I didn't wanna buy it...

01:22:50.962 --> 01:22:53.556
...but I figured it was
one less Vogue in New York.

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.334
I saw it. The pictures are gorgeous.

01:22:56.502 --> 01:22:58.058
Yeah, I'm a beautiful bride.

01:22:58.536 --> 01:23:00.798
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

01:23:00.972 --> 01:23:04.202
Hey, hey, hey, come on in.
- Come on, sweetie.

01:23:04.375 --> 01:23:06.171
Get your hat.

01:23:07.312 --> 01:23:09.472
- Look, the people who don't know...
- Yeah.

01:23:09.646 --> 01:23:12.708
...will only see the beautiful pictures.
The people who do know...

01:23:12.885 --> 01:23:14.908
...will only see what an asshole he is.

01:23:16.254 --> 01:23:17.619
Mommy said a bad word.

01:23:20.758 --> 01:23:23.852
Oh. Is that for me?

01:23:24.028 --> 01:23:26.861
Oh, Lily, thank you.

01:23:27.031 --> 01:23:29.225
Hey, what are you gonna be
for Halloween?

01:23:29.399 --> 01:23:30.458
Cinderella.

01:23:31.537 --> 01:23:35.870
- Or we also bought Mulan.
- No.

01:23:36.342 --> 01:23:39.333
We came to ask you if you would
go trick-or-treating with us.

01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:42.207
- Yeah!
It's just in our building...

01:23:42.381 --> 01:23:44.814
...if you're in the mood.
- Yeah!

01:23:45.883 --> 01:23:47.782
Yeah!

01:23:57.997 --> 01:23:59.931
- No costume?
No, look closer.

01:24:00.098 --> 01:24:04.466
I'm the scariest thing in New York,
jilted at 41. Boo!

01:24:07.906 --> 01:24:10.066
You know you have to
give me some of your loot?

01:24:10.242 --> 01:24:12.903
- Yeah.
- Aw.

01:24:13.712 --> 01:24:16.374
Let's put your mask on.

01:24:16.547 --> 01:24:18.981
- Look...
- Trick or treat!

01:24:19.151 --> 01:24:21.515
Oh! Carrie.

01:24:21.687 --> 01:24:23.450
I saw you in Vogue.

01:24:23.622 --> 01:24:25.612
I'm so sorry.

01:24:27.291 --> 01:24:28.349
There you go, honey.

01:24:30.796 --> 01:24:32.955
Trick or treat!

01:24:57.423 --> 01:24:58.821
Louise.

01:25:01.226 --> 01:25:04.388
Oh, my Lord. I didn't even recognize you.

01:25:04.563 --> 01:25:07.428
That's the point. My head's
in the Witness Protection Program.

01:25:07.597 --> 01:25:09.658
I'm feeling that look on you though.

01:25:09.836 --> 01:25:14.465
- And I am feeling that Chanel on you.
- Mine till Tuesday.

01:25:16.641 --> 01:25:20.042
- All right, so...
- Here. Time to rejoin the world.

01:25:20.213 --> 01:25:22.042
Already?

01:25:23.882 --> 01:25:29.343
- Your new number, area code 347-85...
- Ho... Ho... Hold it.

01:25:29.621 --> 01:25:31.280
347?

01:25:31.456 --> 01:25:35.187
Oh, no. No, I'm a 917 gal,
always have been.

01:25:35.494 --> 01:25:38.362
I tried. It's no longer available.

01:25:38.531 --> 01:25:39.963
Now you're 347.

01:25:40.432 --> 01:25:41.660
Samantha Jones.

01:25:41.834 --> 01:25:45.098
Carrie Bradshaw. Or I used to be.

01:25:45.269 --> 01:25:46.499
Talk to me.

01:25:47.105 --> 01:25:50.872
I'm a 347 area code. How awful is that?

01:25:51.043 --> 01:25:53.011
347 is the new New York.

01:25:53.178 --> 01:25:57.239
Well, I want the old New York
with my old 917 and my old will to live.

01:25:57.417 --> 01:26:01.183
Old New York, new New York.
Honey, at least it's New York.

01:26:01.886 --> 01:26:04.515
Another hard thing about being in L. A:

01:26:04.823 --> 01:26:06.882
My sex-on-a-stick next-door neighbor.

01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:09.585
- I can't stop looking at him.
- Looking?

01:26:09.762 --> 01:26:14.927
Just looking. After seeing Steve's face
at the rehearsal dinner, I could never...

01:26:15.934 --> 01:26:18.959
Oh, but you should see this guy.
Every night...

01:26:19.138 --> 01:26:21.765
...sex with a different partner. He's like...

01:26:22.675 --> 01:26:27.110
...me five years ago.
- Yeah. When I was a 917.

01:26:27.279 --> 01:26:30.372
I mean, what's the point
of having a hot guy next door...

01:26:30.548 --> 01:26:33.143
...if you can't have sex with him?

01:26:33.319 --> 01:26:37.118
We agreed that no one else from the show
but Smith was going to be on the cover.

01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:40.449
Well, get back to me.

01:26:46.064 --> 01:26:47.121
Hey.

01:27:15.395 --> 01:27:18.831
And in an effort to stay out of the house
and out of trouble...

01:27:18.998 --> 01:27:21.521
...Samantha went shopping.

01:27:24.604 --> 01:27:26.003
Rescue a puppy today?

01:27:34.012 --> 01:27:38.574
- She needs a good home. Interested?
- No.

01:27:38.751 --> 01:27:42.653
And just as Samantha convinced herself
that the dog wasn't for her...

01:27:46.492 --> 01:27:49.552
She's been fixed,
but she hasn't lost the urge.

01:27:58.238 --> 01:28:01.695
And because Samantha
couldn't get off...

01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:04.507
...she got things.

01:28:16.855 --> 01:28:20.051
What would happen if these
were to magically disappear?

01:28:20.226 --> 01:28:24.218
- Yeah, I know where you live.
- For a pair like this, I could move.

01:28:24.763 --> 01:28:27.425
Wait, Carrie, not that one.

01:28:33.267 --> 01:28:34.961
Do you want me to get rid of it?

01:28:36.937 --> 01:28:38.563
No.

01:28:39.438 --> 01:28:41.267
No, it's too beautiful.

01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:44.632
I'll just...

01:28:44.843 --> 01:28:47.711
...bury it deep in the back...

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:50.007
...like I did my feelings.

01:28:51.218 --> 01:28:54.674
- Do you miss him?
- Every day.

01:28:56.022 --> 01:28:58.047
It's weird...

01:28:58.990 --> 01:29:01.516
...I haven't cried very much at all.

01:29:01.794 --> 01:29:03.659
I don't know, maybe...

01:29:04.397 --> 01:29:08.094
Maybe you're only allotted
a certain amount of tears per man...

01:29:08.267 --> 01:29:10.166
...and I used mine up.

01:29:10.336 --> 01:29:12.668
Yeah, I know how you feel.

01:29:12.839 --> 01:29:16.332
Because my St. Louis boyfriend
broke up with me last year...

01:29:16.642 --> 01:29:18.439
...and I miss him all the time.

01:29:18.846 --> 01:29:23.681
Suddenly, it dawned on me. There
were two broken hearts in my walk-in.

01:29:26.953 --> 01:29:30.514
Louise, we need a cocktail.
Grab your rental.

01:29:31.358 --> 01:29:34.020
And it threw me so hard.

01:29:34.429 --> 01:29:37.191
Because, you know, I thought Will...

01:29:37.363 --> 01:29:39.057
That's his name.

01:29:39.499 --> 01:29:43.799
- I thought he was the love of my life.
- Well, what happened?

01:29:44.770 --> 01:29:48.228
He said he loved me and all,
but he didn't think that I was the one.

01:29:49.708 --> 01:29:54.545
That shit hurt. But, you know, whatever.

01:29:54.715 --> 01:29:57.683
- I'm not gonna give up on love.
- Good.

01:29:57.850 --> 01:30:00.182
Love is the thing, you know.

01:30:02.989 --> 01:30:04.013
You see that?

01:30:04.191 --> 01:30:09.060
That's love.
And I'm bringing it to me all day long.

01:30:10.998 --> 01:30:12.589
Excuse me.

01:30:17.537 --> 01:30:21.233
Oh, I remember that smile.
Who's the guy?

01:30:21.407 --> 01:30:24.569
Someone I just met.
He wants me to meet him for drinks.

01:30:24.744 --> 01:30:27.770
At 11:30? Oh, that's a booty call.

01:30:27.948 --> 01:30:31.508
No, it's not.
He's a waiter, he just got off work.

01:30:31.684 --> 01:30:35.916
Louise. Now, I may not get texts,
I may not send texts, but trust me.

01:30:36.090 --> 01:30:39.285
The subtext of that text? Booty.

01:30:40.527 --> 01:30:43.519
But if he meets me,
then it's not a booty call, right?

01:30:45.697 --> 01:30:49.361
All right, then. Enjoy yourself.

01:30:49.536 --> 01:30:51.263
That's what your 20s are for.

01:30:51.939 --> 01:30:54.237
Your 30s are to learn the lessons.

01:30:54.408 --> 01:30:57.001
Your 40s are to pay for the drinks.

01:30:57.577 --> 01:31:01.307
Well, in that case, I'll take another one.

01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:05.075
It's all about the desk.

01:31:05.252 --> 01:31:08.277
If I find the desk, the writing will come.
And it better come...

01:31:08.455 --> 01:31:12.516
...because I'm using my new book advance
to pay the fancy decorator.

01:31:13.828 --> 01:31:18.626
I think it is so great that you're
redoing your entire apartment.

01:31:18.798 --> 01:31:21.232
Yeah, well, out with the old and...

01:31:21.401 --> 01:31:24.960
...oh, in with the overpriced.

01:31:28.009 --> 01:31:32.809
Hey. Harry called me and
mentioned that you're not running.

01:31:33.013 --> 01:31:37.383
- Why'd he do that?
- Because he loves you and he's concerned.

01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:39.678
There's nothing to be concerned about.

01:31:39.854 --> 01:31:44.585
Well, did...? Did the doctor say
that it's not safe or something?

01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:48.519
No. She said because
I'm already a runner, it's fine.

01:31:49.629 --> 01:31:51.255
So then, why are you not...?

01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:53.694
Because I'm afraid
something bad is gonna happen.

01:31:53.867 --> 01:31:57.702
- It's a miracle I'm even pregnant.
- Okay.

01:31:58.839 --> 01:32:01.636
I have everything I ever wanted.

01:32:01.808 --> 01:32:04.174
I am so happy that I'm terrified.

01:32:04.711 --> 01:32:09.670
Nobody gets everything that they want.
Look at you. Look at Miranda.

01:32:10.450 --> 01:32:12.849
You're good people
and look at what happened to you.

01:32:13.018 --> 01:32:15.318
Of course something bad
is gonna happen to me.

01:32:15.488 --> 01:32:17.046
Sweetie...

01:32:17.225 --> 01:32:19.920
...you shit your pants this year.

01:32:20.093 --> 01:32:21.218
Maybe you're done.

01:32:25.868 --> 01:32:28.529
You run every day, that's what you do.

01:32:28.704 --> 01:32:32.569
You can't stop being who you are
because you're afraid, right?

01:32:34.408 --> 01:32:35.705
All right.

01:32:36.109 --> 01:32:39.476
Okay. Here we go.

01:32:41.314 --> 01:32:42.975
Okay.

01:32:47.319 --> 01:32:50.448
And as the last
of the autumn leaves fell away...

01:32:50.623 --> 01:32:53.059
...so did Charlotte's fear.

01:32:55.196 --> 01:33:00.462
By the time the first snow fell,
Charlotte got her stride back.

01:33:07.841 --> 01:33:11.505
Are you sure you don't want me
to R.S.V.P. To any of these holiday parties?

01:33:11.679 --> 01:33:14.305
No, I am perfectly happy
spending time alone.

01:33:14.481 --> 01:33:16.813
You sure?
Because this looks like a good one.

01:33:16.983 --> 01:33:20.247
Go home. Seriously,
you're gonna miss your plane, go.

01:33:20.655 --> 01:33:24.489
Okay. But first...

01:33:27.463 --> 01:33:29.693
Merry Christmas.

01:33:31.799 --> 01:33:35.359
- You didn't have to.
- It's just something silly.

01:33:37.738 --> 01:33:39.171
Oh.

01:33:39.706 --> 01:33:43.197
- Oh, Louise from St. Louis.
- You said you never saw it.

01:33:43.376 --> 01:33:45.777
Well, jeez.

01:33:45.946 --> 01:33:47.881
Now I feel bad.

01:33:48.049 --> 01:33:51.575
If I had known
we were exchanging gifts...

01:33:55.356 --> 01:33:58.188
...I would have bought you one
two weeks ago...

01:33:58.359 --> 01:34:00.918
...and hidden it here.

01:34:04.399 --> 01:34:09.027
- That is not what I think it is.
- I don't know, open it.

01:34:21.983 --> 01:34:23.848
Oh, my God.

01:34:24.118 --> 01:34:26.245
My very own Louis Vuitton?

01:34:26.422 --> 01:34:29.252
That's right. No more rental for you.

01:34:29.791 --> 01:34:32.691
Look who's home from the big city.

01:34:34.328 --> 01:34:37.319
It was the best money I'd ever spent.

01:34:38.199 --> 01:34:41.327
New Year's Eve and a cup of noodles.

01:34:50.779 --> 01:34:53.213
So you remember
what you're gonna say at midnight?

01:34:53.382 --> 01:34:56.543
- Happy New Year.
- Yeah.

01:34:56.717 --> 01:34:59.515
Except you're gonna say it
much more excited than that.

01:34:59.687 --> 01:35:04.988
- You're gonna say, "Happy New Year!"
- Happy New Year.

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:09.721
Yeah. And you say that
and then you kiss.

01:35:17.572 --> 01:35:19.096
All right.

01:35:19.774 --> 01:35:21.765
- All ready to go, B-boy?
- Yeah.

01:35:21.943 --> 01:35:24.934
Did you remember to pack
the Batman that Santa brought you?

01:35:25.113 --> 01:35:26.477
I think it's in the kitchen.

01:35:26.648 --> 01:35:28.739
Oh, you gotta have the new Batman, huh?

01:35:36.625 --> 01:35:38.820
You got plans with the girls?

01:35:38.993 --> 01:35:40.290
Um...

01:35:40.462 --> 01:35:43.328
We're all kind of staying in tonight.

01:35:45.199 --> 01:35:48.191
Would you like to
come out and eat with us?

01:35:49.504 --> 01:35:52.769
We could go someplace
on your side of the bridge.

01:35:52.941 --> 01:35:55.773
No. Thank you.

01:35:59.915 --> 01:36:02.748
Miranda, I never meant to hurt you.

01:36:07.121 --> 01:36:09.112
I found him.

01:36:09.956 --> 01:36:13.290
- Batman.
- Oh, there he is. Batman.

01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:15.087
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:36:15.263 --> 01:36:16.924
- Put your hat on.
- Yeah.

01:36:17.097 --> 01:36:20.125
- It's snowing out.
- Here you go.

01:36:20.303 --> 01:36:23.031
I'm gonna bring Batman.
Okay.

01:36:23.205 --> 01:36:24.934
Happy New Year.

01:36:25.774 --> 01:36:27.035
Happy New Year.

01:36:28.242 --> 01:36:29.402
Kiss.

01:36:40.322 --> 01:36:42.619
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

01:36:45.595 --> 01:36:47.494
This is my new...

01:36:50.298 --> 01:36:52.095
You know what we're gonna do?

01:36:52.267 --> 01:36:55.462
We're gonna light a firecracker
at midnight.

01:37:46.922 --> 01:37:49.686
- Hello?
Happy New Year.

01:37:49.857 --> 01:37:51.520
We're having a fabulous time.

01:37:51.693 --> 01:37:54.218
The only thing missing is you. Come.

01:37:54.396 --> 01:37:57.832
That's sweet but I can't.
I'm... I'm writing.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.967
Oh, okay.

01:38:00.536 --> 01:38:02.162
You're not really writing, are you?

01:38:03.739 --> 01:38:07.038
No. You're not really
having a fabulous time, are you?

01:38:07.209 --> 01:38:08.870
No. Rescue me.

01:38:10.546 --> 01:38:11.977
There's no one fun here.

01:38:12.147 --> 01:38:13.910
It's very forced-festive.

01:38:14.082 --> 01:38:17.313
Oh, yes. That's just what
every New Year's Eve party needs...

01:38:17.486 --> 01:38:19.647
...a visit from the lost Brontë sister.

01:38:20.989 --> 01:38:23.149
Well, better a Brontë sister
than a Hilton sister.

01:38:23.326 --> 01:38:25.349
Thanks, but...

01:38:25.526 --> 01:38:30.122
...by 10 p. m. I will be in bed asleep...

01:38:31.098 --> 01:38:37.059
...and blissfully unaware of
how fabulous this night is supposed to be.

01:38:58.127 --> 01:39:00.059
- Hello?
So I thought...

01:39:00.227 --> 01:39:02.321
...that one of the perks
of having a family...

01:39:02.498 --> 01:39:06.228
...was that you didn't have to spend
New Year's Eve alone with Chinese food.

01:39:06.402 --> 01:39:08.890
I am alone with Chinese food.

01:39:09.738 --> 01:39:13.435
- I was asleep.
- Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

01:39:13.610 --> 01:39:17.339
No, no, that's okay. Where's Brady?

01:39:17.513 --> 01:39:21.210
- It's Steve's night.
- Oh. Right.

01:39:21.384 --> 01:39:26.150
- Don't wake up. Go... Go back to sleep.
- No, it's okay.

01:39:26.322 --> 01:39:28.789
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

01:39:28.956 --> 01:39:31.016
I got all choked up...

01:39:31.194 --> 01:39:34.719
...watching stupid New Year's Eve stuff
alone on TV.

01:39:34.897 --> 01:39:38.730
- You want me to come over?
- I'm all the way downtown.

01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:41.563
No, I can... You know, I can...
I grab a cab.

01:39:42.573 --> 01:39:46.337
On New Year's? No way.
I'm... I'm... I'm fine.

01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:48.910
Really. I just...
I just wanted to talk a little.

01:39:49.079 --> 01:39:52.672
Go back to sleep. I'll...
I'll see you next year.

01:39:53.148 --> 01:39:55.548
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:40:33.556 --> 01:40:35.047
Good one.

01:40:41.130 --> 01:40:43.724
- It's almost time.
- Champagne?

01:40:54.009 --> 01:40:56.909
Oh, my God. Thank God you're here.

01:42:30.206 --> 01:42:32.800
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

01:42:33.176 --> 01:42:35.111
You're not alone.

01:42:39.315 --> 01:42:42.216
Happy New Year.

01:43:27.097 --> 01:43:29.257
- A young child that perhaps they've...
- Oh!

01:43:29.433 --> 01:43:31.297
- Hey, easy there, girl.
- You all right?

01:43:31.466 --> 01:43:32.492
Yeah. Thanks.

01:43:32.670 --> 01:43:35.866
Three months driving in L.A.
And I forgot how to use my fucking legs.

01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.803
Every spring, the women of New York...

01:43:37.975 --> 01:43:42.376
...leave the foolish choices of their past
behind and look forward to the future.

01:43:42.545 --> 01:43:44.740
This is known as Fashion Week.

01:43:44.982 --> 01:43:46.949
Excuse me. Hi.

01:43:47.917 --> 01:43:49.543
Oh, there we are.

01:43:50.153 --> 01:43:54.089
- We're in the front row?
- I had to pull some strings.

01:43:54.624 --> 01:43:56.682
- Very nice.
- I should go thank them.

01:43:56.860 --> 01:44:00.852
Decide where we're gonna go for lunch
and I'll make a call. It's just like old times.

01:44:01.466 --> 01:44:03.955
So this is what you all
spent your Saturdays doing...

01:44:04.135 --> 01:44:06.932
...while I was with Brady and Steve
at the Brooklyn Aquarium?

01:44:07.604 --> 01:44:09.433
Well...

01:44:09.706 --> 01:44:11.901
...not every Saturday.

01:44:12.075 --> 01:44:16.274
Just so you know, we always had
front row at the mammal show.

01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:19.506
Steve does the funniest
dolphin impression.

01:44:19.683 --> 01:44:23.550
Actually, it's more Steve as a dolphin.

01:44:28.925 --> 01:44:30.722
You really can't forgive him?

01:44:32.029 --> 01:44:33.620
Are you suggesting something?

01:44:34.598 --> 01:44:37.464
I like Steve. I always liked Steve.

01:44:37.634 --> 01:44:41.264
He's apologized 100 times.
He's not seeing anyone else.

01:44:41.439 --> 01:44:42.461
What's it gonna take?

01:44:42.839 --> 01:44:44.931
Are you also suggesting
that she forgive Big?

01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:49.271
No. I could kill Big.

01:44:49.713 --> 01:44:52.113
Sometimes when I'm running...

01:44:52.414 --> 01:44:56.715
...I imagine what I would say to him
if I ever saw him again.

01:44:56.887 --> 01:44:59.913
I have the perfect opening line.

01:45:00.091 --> 01:45:02.057
Do you wanna hear it?

01:45:02.893 --> 01:45:05.020
Uh, yeah.

01:45:06.263 --> 01:45:09.288
I curse the day you were born.

01:45:10.601 --> 01:45:14.127
That's impressive. You better work up
a hand gesture to go with it.

01:45:25.116 --> 01:45:27.084
I didn't know if it was the fashion...

01:45:27.250 --> 01:45:30.048
...or the fact that the four of us
were together again...

01:45:30.221 --> 01:45:32.951
...but for the first time in a long time...

01:45:33.124 --> 01:45:35.524
...I felt like myself.

01:46:06.592 --> 01:46:10.993
Well, let's get a cab, okay?
I'm absolutely starving. I don't know what...

01:46:11.161 --> 01:46:12.753
Fur is murder!

01:46:12.929 --> 01:46:16.363
Murder! Murder!

01:46:16.533 --> 01:46:20.595
- Murder! Murder!
- God, I miss New York.

01:46:23.504 --> 01:46:28.375
And a couple of weeks later, I met
Saint Louise's St. Louis boyfriend, Will.

01:46:28.546 --> 01:46:31.344
Over Christmas, they realized
how much they loved each other.

01:46:31.515 --> 01:46:33.176
- I'm Carrie.
- Will.

01:46:33.751 --> 01:46:36.014
Just in time for Valentine's Day.

01:47:01.878 --> 01:47:02.904
Hello?

01:47:03.081 --> 01:47:06.413
I'm calling to make sure that you
aren't hanging from your shower rod.

01:47:07.217 --> 01:47:11.017
- You called about an hour too early.
- So, what's the V-Day plan?

01:47:11.188 --> 01:47:14.714
Well, Miranda and I are going to dinner...

01:47:14.892 --> 01:47:17.291
...and then a very violent slasher movie.

01:47:17.461 --> 01:47:19.053
- Perfect.
- You?

01:47:19.429 --> 01:47:22.660
I'm making Smith sushi.
Pause for reaction.

01:47:22.833 --> 01:47:24.699
Wow, you do that?

01:47:24.869 --> 01:47:27.235
We took a class a while back.

01:47:27.406 --> 01:47:29.532
And when he comes in that door
at 7:30...

01:47:29.708 --> 01:47:33.700
...I'm going to surprise him by
laying naked on the dining-room table...

01:47:33.879 --> 01:47:36.210
...covered with homemade sushi.

01:47:36.381 --> 01:47:38.905
Boy, you do have time on your hands.

01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:41.181
So, what else is new?

01:48:04.808 --> 01:48:07.937
There is a whole lot of love in this room.

01:48:08.113 --> 01:48:11.240
Is it me or is Valentine's Day
this year on steroids?

01:48:11.415 --> 01:48:14.942
No. I think it was like this last year.
We just played for the other team.

01:48:15.754 --> 01:48:18.813
Good evening.
This is our Valentine's night menu.

01:48:18.991 --> 01:48:22.756
All of our specials are romantically themed
and designed to be split for two.

01:48:22.926 --> 01:48:24.259
- Are we having wine?
- Yes.

01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:25.657
- Glass or a...?
- Bottle.

01:48:25.865 --> 01:48:28.764
I'll be right back to take
you and your girlfriend's order.

01:48:35.206 --> 01:48:39.005
Why would you have looked
at the Vogue today of all days?

01:48:39.175 --> 01:48:41.200
Because I'm an emotional cutter.

01:48:42.381 --> 01:48:45.440
I deserve what I got.
Running all over New York...

01:48:45.617 --> 01:48:48.084
...believing that I'm finally getting
my happy ending.

01:48:48.251 --> 01:48:49.913
"See? Love does conquer all.

01:48:50.086 --> 01:48:52.249
Look at me in
my one-of-a-kind wedding gown...

01:48:52.424 --> 01:48:55.416
...marrying the love of my life. "
- Would you like another bot...?

01:48:55.593 --> 01:48:56.992
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:48:58.563 --> 01:49:01.690
And Miranda, in that article,
I did not say "we" once.

01:49:02.134 --> 01:49:06.660
No. The whole article
was "I think" and "I want. "

01:49:06.838 --> 01:49:09.897
- It was from your point of view.
- Yeah, exactly. My point of view.

01:49:10.075 --> 01:49:13.375
Exactly. The whole wedding
was my point of view.

01:49:14.578 --> 01:49:17.306
I let... I let the wedding
get bigger than Big.

01:49:19.918 --> 01:49:23.353
I am the reason that
he did not get out of the car.

01:49:24.991 --> 01:49:26.513
Okay.

01:49:27.293 --> 01:49:31.819
I said something to Big
that I shouldn't have...

01:49:31.997 --> 01:49:33.828
...at the rehearsal dinner.

01:49:34.331 --> 01:49:35.822
What do you mean?

01:49:37.135 --> 01:49:40.194
After Steve showed up,
I was really upset.

01:49:40.372 --> 01:49:42.600
And I bumped into Big...

01:49:45.309 --> 01:49:47.743
...and I said that you two
were crazy to get married.

01:49:47.913 --> 01:49:50.244
Here we go, your Shiraz.

01:49:59.791 --> 01:50:02.350
Okay, great. Thanks so much.

01:50:06.799 --> 01:50:10.630
I'm sorry. I was upset. Steve had...

01:50:10.801 --> 01:50:15.237
I have been going over this and over this
in my mind for five months.

01:50:16.974 --> 01:50:20.602
And for five months,
you kept a secret like that?

01:50:20.779 --> 01:50:23.305
- I tried to tell you once, but then...
- Once?

01:50:23.483 --> 01:50:26.076
You tried to tell me once?

01:50:26.551 --> 01:50:29.451
You should have tried to tell me
every single day.

01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:32.054
I know. I was waiting for the right time.

01:50:32.224 --> 01:50:35.124
There is no right time to tell me
that you ruined my marriage.

01:50:35.292 --> 01:50:37.817
It just happened. I wasn't thinking.

01:50:39.899 --> 01:50:43.664
- Carrie, please don't go.
- You know what I think hurts the most?

01:50:44.535 --> 01:50:46.935
Is that you kept a secret from me.

01:50:47.105 --> 01:50:51.405
And I have never, ever
kept a secret from you.

01:50:51.576 --> 01:50:53.237
Ever.

01:50:55.547 --> 01:50:57.674
No, I'm lying. For the last five months...

01:50:57.849 --> 01:51:02.182
...I've been thinking that it is
a huge mistake that you left Steve.

01:51:02.354 --> 01:51:03.821
There.

01:51:04.756 --> 01:51:06.518
How does it feel?

01:51:06.691 --> 01:51:09.591
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:51:29.748 --> 01:51:31.772
Any minute now.

01:51:41.627 --> 01:51:43.527
Hey, babe, it's me. Pick up.

01:51:44.329 --> 01:51:45.886
Pick up.

01:51:46.299 --> 01:51:48.425
All right, it's 7:20. I'm still at the studio.

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:52.560
We're behind. I'm gonna be a little bit late.
Sorry. Bye.

01:52:02.247 --> 01:52:03.941
Forty minutes later...

01:52:04.115 --> 01:52:08.483
...sushi, Samantha, still no Smith.

01:52:15.027 --> 01:52:16.995
This is bullshit.

01:52:48.228 --> 01:52:52.595
It was the same Valentine night
Samantha had planned...

01:52:52.765 --> 01:52:54.959
...minus the sushi.

01:52:56.535 --> 01:52:58.730
And the other woman.

01:53:08.782 --> 01:53:10.611
I'm home.

01:53:11.116 --> 01:53:13.915
- Man, that was a long day.
- You're three hours late.

01:53:14.087 --> 01:53:16.417
Bummer, I know. Did you eat?

01:53:16.589 --> 01:53:18.079
Yes, I ate.

01:53:18.257 --> 01:53:20.384
I ate the sushi
that I hand-made for you.

01:53:20.859 --> 01:53:25.796
The sushi that I laid all over my naked body
as a Valentine surprise for you.

01:53:26.266 --> 01:53:28.789
Why are you so upset? I called.

01:53:28.968 --> 01:53:30.799
I couldn't pick up the phone.

01:53:30.970 --> 01:53:33.962
My body was covered everywhere
with sushi.

01:53:34.141 --> 01:53:37.667
I got wasabi in places where
one should never get wasabi.

01:53:37.842 --> 01:53:42.906
Oh, you think it's funny
that I slaved all day in this kitchen...

01:53:43.083 --> 01:53:45.915
...to make a lovely meal for you?

01:53:46.752 --> 01:53:50.280
You made some sushi. It's not a big deal.

01:53:50.457 --> 01:53:52.616
"Not a big deal. " Here.

01:53:53.427 --> 01:53:54.825
I am not the type of woman...

01:53:54.994 --> 01:53:57.292
...who sits home all day
waiting for a man!

01:53:58.432 --> 01:54:02.993
Enjoy your California handmade roll!

01:54:05.171 --> 01:54:08.606
Happy fucking Valentine's Day.

01:54:16.749 --> 01:54:18.581
It's Carrie, leave me a message.

01:54:18.752 --> 01:54:21.447
Carrie, it's me. Please pick up.

01:54:21.619 --> 01:54:26.250
Three days of
"I'm sorry" calls and e-mails and flowers...

01:54:26.426 --> 01:54:28.359
...and I still wasn't ready.

01:54:28.527 --> 01:54:32.053
It was the longest we'd ever gone
without speaking.

01:54:38.704 --> 01:54:39.966
Carrie.

01:54:40.539 --> 01:54:41.631
Hi.

01:54:42.609 --> 01:54:46.203
- I need to talk to you.
- How long have you been waiting here?

01:54:47.881 --> 01:54:49.643
Seventeen-dollars long.

01:54:52.217 --> 01:54:54.379
Please get in. It just hit 18.

01:55:08.067 --> 01:55:12.697
- This is weird, not talking.
- I'm upset.

01:55:13.973 --> 01:55:18.604
Carrie, I understand, but it just happened.
I never meant to hurt you.

01:55:23.082 --> 01:55:25.072
You have to forgive me.

01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:28.012
You know...

01:55:28.187 --> 01:55:29.210
- What?
- No.

01:55:29.389 --> 01:55:31.480
No, please, what were you gonna say?

01:55:31.657 --> 01:55:34.625
You badger me to forgive you
in three days.

01:55:34.794 --> 01:55:38.732
You won't even consider forgiving Steve
for something he did six months ago.

01:55:39.131 --> 01:55:40.689
It's not the same thing.

01:55:41.736 --> 01:55:43.292
It's forgiveness.

01:55:48.208 --> 01:55:51.041
I don't know that I can trust
that it won't happen again.

01:55:52.612 --> 01:55:54.375
Steve, you're very quiet today.

01:55:56.215 --> 01:56:00.515
Miranda, I know I made it hard
for you to trust me...

01:56:03.788 --> 01:56:06.587
...but you made it hard for me to trust you.
- Me?

01:56:06.759 --> 01:56:10.160
The way you treated me
and cut me out of your life like that.

01:56:10.329 --> 01:56:12.992
I mean, yeah, I broke a vow...

01:56:13.167 --> 01:56:16.135
...but what about the other vows?

01:56:16.304 --> 01:56:20.261
Like promising to love someone
for better or for worse.

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:22.169
What about that?

01:56:22.809 --> 01:56:25.972
How do I know she's not gonna
punish me for the rest of my life?

01:56:26.145 --> 01:56:27.407
You don't.

01:56:28.247 --> 01:56:32.776
And she doesn't know for sure that
you won't have another indiscretion.

01:56:35.355 --> 01:56:38.416
All you can know is that
you wanna move forward...

01:56:38.592 --> 01:56:42.995
...and risk that the love you have
for each other won't allow that to happen.

01:56:46.299 --> 01:56:49.234
And that's what we'll discover here.

01:56:55.042 --> 01:56:57.531
So we're done with our last session.

01:56:57.710 --> 01:57:00.271
We're not allowed to talk to each other
for two weeks...

01:57:00.447 --> 01:57:04.176
...while we figure out if being together
again is something that we really want.

01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:07.807
And then we had to
pick a place to meet...

01:57:07.987 --> 01:57:11.947
...and if we both show up on that day,
the past no longer exists.

01:57:12.127 --> 01:57:14.821
It's like showing up
is the promise to each other...

01:57:14.996 --> 01:57:19.557
...that we're both willing to
let it all go and move forward.

01:57:19.733 --> 01:57:21.063
Wow.

01:57:21.235 --> 01:57:23.668
- Can you do that?
- I don't know.

01:57:23.838 --> 01:57:27.001
I don't know.
I have a lot of thinking to do.

01:57:27.174 --> 01:57:30.801
- Thinking? Or feeling?
- What do you mean?

01:57:30.977 --> 01:57:35.311
Well, Miranda, you're a lawyer. You know,
you can argue both sides of any case.

01:57:35.483 --> 01:57:40.886
But why we feel what we feel
isn't logical. It's emotional.

01:57:41.055 --> 01:57:42.919
So I'm sorry, Harvard, but I'm afraid...

01:57:43.089 --> 01:57:46.547
...you're gonna have to base
this decision on your emotions.

01:57:46.727 --> 01:57:49.921
Well, then I'm screwed.
I don't know what I feel.

01:57:50.096 --> 01:57:52.496
You will. There will come a moment
when you know.

01:57:52.666 --> 01:57:55.293
And if it's "yes,"
then all that brilliant logic...

01:57:55.468 --> 01:57:58.062
...it's gonna go right out the window
with the past.

01:57:58.239 --> 01:57:59.227
Ugh.

01:57:59.405 --> 01:58:02.067
And I thought picking a spot to meet
was gonna be the challenge.

01:58:02.241 --> 01:58:05.440
- Where is it?
- On the Brooklyn Bridge.

01:58:06.615 --> 01:58:10.744
- Halfway between our two places.
- Very logical, and yet poetic.

01:58:11.283 --> 01:58:13.479
Poetic if we both show up.

01:58:13.653 --> 01:58:16.418
Otherwise you're on a bridge, rejected.

01:58:17.690 --> 01:58:19.682
It's not a good plan.

01:58:25.066 --> 01:58:27.193
- Hey.
Hey.

01:58:27.701 --> 01:58:29.100
I got two pieces of good news.

01:58:29.268 --> 01:58:31.932
- Oh, and I've got two coffees.
- Thank you.

01:58:32.106 --> 01:58:33.835
Here you go. So, what's up?

01:58:34.009 --> 01:58:37.944
I just heard from your realtor
and the apartment on 5th has finally sold.

01:58:38.112 --> 01:58:42.548
You got 60 days before the new owner
takes possession, and you're out of there.

01:58:44.084 --> 01:58:45.984
And what is the other news?

01:58:50.958 --> 01:58:54.824
I'm moving back to St. Louis
and we're getting married in the fall.

01:58:54.996 --> 01:58:56.427
Oh, my God.

01:58:57.098 --> 01:58:59.965
Wait a minute, I gotta see that.

01:59:00.165 --> 01:59:04.727
- Well, it's gorgeous.
- And you know what? It ain't rented.

01:59:09.075 --> 01:59:11.167
On the day of her decision deadline...

01:59:11.344 --> 01:59:14.973
...true to form, Miranda had argued
both sides of the case.

01:59:15.149 --> 01:59:16.673
Thank you.

01:59:38.706 --> 01:59:40.696
It suddenly dawned on Miranda...

01:59:40.875 --> 01:59:44.936
...that Steve's list might have
had more cons than pros.

02:00:30.192 --> 02:00:33.216
And Miranda never looked back.

02:00:38.934 --> 02:00:42.368
Well, almost never.

02:00:42.536 --> 02:00:44.162
Kiss me.

02:00:48.942 --> 02:00:52.605
Meanwhile, back in Lost Angeles...

02:00:55.450 --> 02:00:59.079
Turns out New Age philosophy
wasn't the secret.

02:01:01.089 --> 02:01:04.718
Samantha had money, a career,
and a man who loved her.

02:01:04.894 --> 02:01:08.851
But still, she couldn't shake the feeling
that something was missing from her life.

02:01:09.029 --> 02:01:10.929
Baby, come back.

02:01:11.432 --> 02:01:13.525
That's not our house.

02:01:13.702 --> 02:01:16.363
Where are you going?

02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:55.900
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

02:01:56.077 --> 02:01:57.474
I'm your next-door neighbor...

02:01:57.645 --> 02:02:00.342
...and my dog ran up on
your dick... Deck.

02:02:03.284 --> 02:02:06.412
Suddenly it wasn't so secret
what she was missing.

02:02:06.787 --> 02:02:08.119
Wanna join me?

02:02:11.992 --> 02:02:13.550
Uh...

02:02:18.065 --> 02:02:20.899
Hey. I'm Dante.

02:02:21.068 --> 02:02:23.832
Stop by anytime.

02:02:26.075 --> 02:02:28.134
It was official.

02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:30.801
From the minute she met Dante...

02:02:30.979 --> 02:02:34.073
...Samantha was in hell.

02:02:35.952 --> 02:02:39.045
And by spring, I looked like my old self...

02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:43.019
...in my new apartment,
just in time for the baby shower.

02:02:43.191 --> 02:02:45.591
- Oh, excuse me, honey. Hi.
- Sure.

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:46.783
Hi.

02:02:46.962 --> 02:02:49.487
A woman put a glass on your new desk
without a coaster.

02:02:49.664 --> 02:02:52.222
I said, "If you do it again,
I'm gonna break your arm. "

02:02:52.399 --> 02:02:53.423
- Thanks.
- Bathroom?

02:02:53.602 --> 02:02:56.197
- Yes. Hey, how's it going?
- Pretty good, I think.

02:02:56.372 --> 02:02:57.838
Good, good, good.

02:02:58.006 --> 02:03:00.474
Where's Samantha?
Her plane landed two hours ago.

02:03:00.642 --> 02:03:03.042
Oh, you know her.
She's probably working out first.

02:03:03.211 --> 02:03:05.042
There's no place like home.

02:03:05.214 --> 02:03:07.373
Sweetie.

02:03:09.518 --> 02:03:10.849
You have a rat in your purse.

02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:13.282
- That rat better be housebroken.
- Take your coat?

02:03:13.456 --> 02:03:16.389
- Sure.
- Hey, cute bag.

02:03:17.659 --> 02:03:19.147
Oh, my gosh, Samantha.

02:03:21.428 --> 02:03:23.624
You have a dog.

02:03:23.799 --> 02:03:26.767
Did you ever think you'd see the day?
Me with a pooch?

02:03:26.935 --> 02:03:28.698
Mother of God, what's with the gut?

02:03:30.706 --> 02:03:32.605
Well, she's eating something out there.

02:03:33.475 --> 02:03:35.534
- Come on in!
Hi!

02:03:35.710 --> 02:03:37.438
We've been waiting for you.

02:03:41.317 --> 02:03:44.682
I eat so I won't cheat.

02:03:44.853 --> 02:03:46.514
What exactly are you eating?

02:03:46.922 --> 02:03:49.186
Everything except Dante's dick.

02:03:49.356 --> 02:03:52.019
Language, please.
This is a grown-up apartment now.

02:03:52.929 --> 02:03:56.057
I guess I didn't realize how big I was
until I saw it on your faces.

02:03:56.233 --> 02:03:59.065
How...? And I say this with love.

02:03:59.235 --> 02:04:01.758
How could you not realize it?

02:04:01.938 --> 02:04:05.305
- I've been avoiding mirrors.
- Well, I'm proud of you for not cheating.

02:04:05.475 --> 02:04:07.566
I don't think there's anything
to be proud of.

02:04:07.743 --> 02:04:11.873
I stuff my face to stop myself from
doing something that feels natural to me.

02:04:12.047 --> 02:04:16.279
Now, listen, this isn't about the weight.
You would look gorgeous at any size.

02:04:16.451 --> 02:04:19.977
- But are you happy?
- Well...

02:04:21.556 --> 02:04:26.790
...relationships aren't always
about being happy, right?

02:04:26.963 --> 02:04:29.590
I mean, how often do you feel happy
in your relationship?

02:04:30.432 --> 02:04:32.731
I'm pretty sure that's to you.

02:04:33.869 --> 02:04:37.234
- Every day.
- You feel happy every day?

02:04:37.406 --> 02:04:41.433
Not all day every day, but every day.

02:04:41.611 --> 02:04:44.099
When was the last time you felt happy?

02:04:44.279 --> 02:04:46.371
Six months ago.

02:04:46.648 --> 02:04:49.582
I think that's normal for L.A.

02:04:49.751 --> 02:04:52.481
- What am I gonna do?
- What's your gut tell you?

02:04:55.824 --> 02:05:00.625
I know, but Smith stayed with me
through chemo.

02:05:01.797 --> 02:05:04.630
And if he can stay with me
through that...

02:05:04.799 --> 02:05:08.064
...then I should be able to
stay in this relationship for him.

02:05:08.237 --> 02:05:11.968
Sweetie, you just compared
your relationship to chemo.

02:05:12.140 --> 02:05:16.666
There we were,
the three mirrors Samantha couldn't avoid.

02:05:16.844 --> 02:05:18.869
And Samantha?

02:05:19.383 --> 02:05:21.942
That pillow cost $300.

02:05:31.627 --> 02:05:33.594
Hi.

02:05:33.762 --> 02:05:35.731
My little monster. Hi.

02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:40.265
Hey. You're home.

02:05:40.434 --> 02:05:43.994
- I thought you were staying the week.
- We need to talk.

02:05:45.307 --> 02:05:47.570
Oh, man.

02:05:49.445 --> 02:05:52.471
- I knew this was coming.
- Yeah.

02:05:52.648 --> 02:05:54.514
This isn't working.

02:05:54.684 --> 02:05:58.641
I've done my best.
I've given it five years and 15 pounds.

02:05:58.821 --> 02:06:00.720
Well, what?

02:06:02.893 --> 02:06:06.759
- You don't love me anymore?
- Yes, I love you.

02:06:07.296 --> 02:06:08.523
It's just...

02:06:10.865 --> 02:06:14.324
I'm just gonna say the thing
you're not supposed to say.

02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:17.303
I love you but I love me more.

02:06:17.473 --> 02:06:20.967
And I've been in a relationship
with myself for 49 years...

02:06:21.145 --> 02:06:23.077
...and that's the one I need to work on.

02:06:25.814 --> 02:06:30.219
You're gonna find a wonderful woman
who loves being in a relationship.

02:06:33.423 --> 02:06:35.514
What will you find?

02:06:36.159 --> 02:06:37.625
I don't know.

02:06:38.326 --> 02:06:40.955
But that's a risk I'm willing to take.

02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:50.169
- Hey, no. Keep it.
- Okay.

02:06:53.075 --> 02:06:55.635
Every time I look down at it...

02:06:59.014 --> 02:07:01.278
...I'm gonna think of you.

02:07:03.586 --> 02:07:07.647
Some love stories aren't epic novels.
Some are short stories.

02:07:07.824 --> 02:07:11.758
But that doesn't make them
any less filled with love.

02:07:12.262 --> 02:07:13.728
At this time...

02:07:13.896 --> 02:07:16.161
...we ask that all passengers
fasten their seat belts...

02:07:16.333 --> 02:07:18.733
...in preparation for landing.

02:07:19.202 --> 02:07:22.261
We're landing in New York.

02:07:22.671 --> 02:07:24.264
I'm gonna need to take that now.

02:07:26.976 --> 02:07:29.740
Okay. Here we go now. Give me that.

02:07:32.948 --> 02:07:35.849
As someone returned to my life...

02:07:36.018 --> 02:07:37.042
...someone left.

02:07:37.219 --> 02:07:39.380
- Stamps, mailing labels.
- Okay.

02:07:39.556 --> 02:07:43.185
And I put all your unopened mail
from your P.O. Box in these envelopes.

02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:44.884
All right.

02:07:48.798 --> 02:07:50.959
And please, please...

02:07:51.133 --> 02:07:54.193
...do not make a mess
out of CarrieBradshaw. Com.

02:07:54.371 --> 02:07:57.828
- Okay.
- It's my masterpiece.

02:07:58.807 --> 02:08:02.436
- What am I gonna do without you?
- You'll find some other girl...

02:08:03.079 --> 02:08:05.012
...but she won't have my style.

02:08:06.047 --> 02:08:08.072
Saint Louise.

02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:11.347
You brought me back to life.

02:08:11.954 --> 02:08:15.391
And you gave me Louise Vuitton.

02:08:21.765 --> 02:08:25.166
Serious. We need to stop crying.

02:08:26.435 --> 02:08:28.596
- Your keys.
- Oh, thanks.

02:08:28.772 --> 02:08:32.036
Wait, wait, wait. Don't forget your love.

02:08:32.908 --> 02:08:36.139
No. I found my love.

02:08:36.446 --> 02:08:38.878
I'm leaving that with you.

02:08:39.583 --> 02:08:43.576
- See you at my wedding.
- I'll meet you in St. Louis.

02:08:47.524 --> 02:08:49.015
Bye.

02:08:55.732 --> 02:08:57.426
And a couple of weeks later...

02:08:57.601 --> 02:09:00.764
...a slow-moving Charlotte
grabbed a quick lunch.

02:09:00.938 --> 02:09:02.733
- Well, when are you due?
- Next week.

02:09:02.904 --> 02:09:06.101
- You look gorgeous.
- Oh, thank you.

02:09:18.054 --> 02:09:21.683
- Hi. Can I get you something to drink?
- No, no.

02:09:21.859 --> 02:09:24.258
- No?
- No. I can't stay.

02:09:24.728 --> 02:09:27.389
Help me. Help me move the table.

02:09:30.900 --> 02:09:32.491
Charlotte.

02:09:33.437 --> 02:09:35.596
Charlotte, wait. Wait.

02:09:35.770 --> 02:09:39.035
Charlotte. Charlotte, don't run,
you're pregnant.

02:09:39.208 --> 02:09:42.906
I don't wanna see you.
I'm so mad at you.

02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:47.778
I was always on your side.
And then you go and you do that to Carrie.

02:09:47.951 --> 02:09:53.287
No! No! I'm not gonna cry.
I'm not gonna waste tears on you.

02:09:54.557 --> 02:09:57.457
I curse the day you were born.

02:10:01.264 --> 02:10:03.788
I think my water just broke. Oh, my God.

02:10:03.968 --> 02:10:06.094
- Taxi!
- My car's right there.

02:10:06.268 --> 02:10:08.897
I don't wanna get in your car! Taxi!

02:10:09.073 --> 02:10:11.666
Please, I gotta get you
to the hospital, okay? Please?

02:10:12.642 --> 02:10:13.665
- Okay?
Lenox Hill.

02:10:13.844 --> 02:10:15.435
Okay. Start the car.

02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:25.311
Hey.

02:10:25.489 --> 02:10:29.652
Hi. Congratulations. A girl.

02:10:30.125 --> 02:10:32.923
It's my lot in life to be surrounded
by beautiful women.

02:10:33.697 --> 02:10:35.130
Come here.

02:10:40.438 --> 02:10:43.930
- She's gorgeous.
- Say hello to Rose.

02:10:44.109 --> 02:10:48.601
- Rose. What a beautiful name.
- It's after Harry's bubbe.

02:10:48.778 --> 02:10:51.974
Now we got a Lily and a Rose.

02:10:52.651 --> 02:10:54.083
Well...

02:10:54.251 --> 02:10:58.049
...I have to say,
you two are very cool customers...

02:10:58.222 --> 02:11:03.454
...making the "baby's here" call
without all the "I'm in labor" drama.

02:11:03.626 --> 02:11:06.219
There was plenty of drama.

02:11:07.162 --> 02:11:09.961
My water broke while I was standing
in front of a restaurant.

02:11:10.368 --> 02:11:14.531
- Wow, that's very dramatic.
- Wait, wait, she's not done.

02:11:14.706 --> 02:11:17.696
- It broke while I was talking to Big.
- What?

02:11:17.874 --> 02:11:19.934
See? Drama.

02:11:20.112 --> 02:11:22.738
I ran into him and
I got so upset, my water broke.

02:11:23.749 --> 02:11:27.478
He brought her to the hospital,
stayed until the baby was born.

02:11:28.652 --> 02:11:31.211
I think he was hoping to see you.

02:11:34.324 --> 02:11:38.525
Well, today is not about him.
It's about beautiful baby Rose.

02:11:39.663 --> 02:11:43.222
So we know she has Charlotte's hair.
What else do we know?

02:11:45.969 --> 02:11:49.929
- She's a doll. Mazel tov.
- Thank you.

02:11:50.941 --> 02:11:52.406
Bye.

02:11:52.778 --> 02:11:55.906
He asked me to ask you to call him.

02:11:56.781 --> 02:11:59.841
I know, it's none of my business,
but I felt bad for the schmuck...

02:12:00.017 --> 02:12:02.313
...hanging around the hospital
hoping to see you.

02:12:02.485 --> 02:12:07.184
Every time he heard someone in heels
walking down the hall, his heart stopped.

02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:13.496
Harry, it's... It's so much more complicated
than you can imagine.

02:12:13.665 --> 02:12:17.623
I know it is, and you have every right
to never call him, but I just...

02:12:17.802 --> 02:12:21.670
I'm a big pile of love today
and I feel bad for the guy.

02:12:21.838 --> 02:12:24.739
He said he's been writing you,
but you never responded.

02:12:26.377 --> 02:12:27.808
No, he's never written to me.

02:12:27.978 --> 02:12:31.070
He said he wrote because
he didn't have your phone number.

02:12:32.117 --> 02:12:35.051
No, he's never written. Ever.

02:12:35.219 --> 02:12:38.245
Then why would he say he had?

02:13:18.629 --> 02:13:23.588
Two hours, two manila envelopes
and countless e-mails later...

02:13:23.767 --> 02:13:27.897
...I was just about to give up
on the big riddle when...

02:13:28.072 --> 02:13:32.599
I had told Louise to put Big in a place where
I would never have to hear from him again.

02:13:44.757 --> 02:13:46.189
This is Louise, leave a message.

02:13:46.357 --> 02:13:48.348
Hey... Hey, Louise, it's me.

02:13:48.527 --> 02:13:52.894
Can you give me the password
for your assistant file?

02:13:53.064 --> 02:13:54.496
Um...

02:13:54.666 --> 02:13:57.066
Okay, call me. Thanks.

02:13:59.371 --> 02:14:01.598
Oh, shit.

02:14:17.922 --> 02:14:21.483
As soon as I typed in "love,"
there he was.

02:14:26.764 --> 02:14:29.062
And because Big
still didn't have the words...

02:14:29.234 --> 02:14:31.930
...he retyped a love letter
from Beethoven.

02:14:34.039 --> 02:14:35.266
And Lord Byron.

02:14:36.875 --> 02:14:39.208
And John Keats.

02:14:39.545 --> 02:14:40.841
And Voltaire.

02:14:41.546 --> 02:14:45.641
There they were, the love letters
of great men, volume one.

02:14:45.816 --> 02:14:50.254
Plus one more
written by John James Preston.

02:15:06.472 --> 02:15:08.961
I wanted to call him, but our love...

02:15:09.141 --> 02:15:12.370
...Carrie and Big,
volumes one, two and three...

02:15:12.844 --> 02:15:14.744
...stopped me.

02:15:20.085 --> 02:15:21.109
Hello?

02:15:21.285 --> 02:15:24.255
I didn't hear my phone.
We're shopping for my wedding gown.

02:15:24.422 --> 02:15:26.583
That dress makes your boobies look big.

02:15:26.758 --> 02:15:29.625
- Mama, can you please? This is a work call.
- Shut up.

02:15:29.795 --> 02:15:34.594
- No, it's okay, I figured it out.
- Well, I was gonna call you anyway.

02:15:34.767 --> 02:15:37.098
Today is the final day
on the 5th Avenue apartment.

02:15:37.268 --> 02:15:39.461
You have till 6:00
before they change the locks.

02:15:39.639 --> 02:15:41.402
No, I don't need to go over there.

02:15:41.973 --> 02:15:43.907
Do you not want those never-worn shoes?

02:15:44.075 --> 02:15:46.440
Oh, God, I completely forgot.

02:15:46.610 --> 02:15:50.237
If you don't, you can send them to me
and I'll squeeze my feet into them.

02:15:50.415 --> 02:15:52.280
But it's already 5:00.

02:15:52.449 --> 02:15:55.940
Hello? They are never-been-worn,
$400 shoes.

02:15:56.121 --> 02:16:00.992
Actually 525.
Yeah, okay. All right, thanks. Bye.

02:16:01.827 --> 02:16:03.885
Taxi!

02:16:13.339 --> 02:16:16.830
The light in our prewar apartment...

02:16:17.008 --> 02:16:20.307
...looked completely different postwar.

02:16:40.931 --> 02:16:45.632
I was gonna get these to you.
I didn't want it to be a total loss.

02:16:45.938 --> 02:16:49.805
It wasn't logic, it was love.

02:17:10.930 --> 02:17:13.897
Why did we ever decide to get married?

02:17:16.066 --> 02:17:21.562
I guess we were afraid
it would mean something if we didn't.

02:17:25.812 --> 02:17:28.644
I'm sorry to have done that to you.

02:17:29.581 --> 02:17:32.277
I'm sorry to have done that to you.

02:17:36.254 --> 02:17:38.346
You know the funny part?

02:17:40.392 --> 02:17:42.585
Is there a funny part?

02:17:42.762 --> 02:17:47.061
We were perfectly happy before
we decided to live happily ever after.

02:17:47.531 --> 02:17:49.397
Guess the joke's on us.

02:17:58.443 --> 02:18:02.312
- It's a good closet.
- Thanks.

02:18:05.584 --> 02:18:07.949
It's comfortable.

02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:11.651
Is this what you had in mind
when you installed the carpet?

02:18:12.691 --> 02:18:15.683
I'd like to think I was that smooth.

02:18:23.101 --> 02:18:26.936
We better get up
before the new owners bust in on us.

02:18:36.014 --> 02:18:39.745
And the way we decided to get married...

02:18:39.919 --> 02:18:41.852
...it was all business.

02:18:42.020 --> 02:18:44.147
No romance.

02:18:46.659 --> 02:18:51.754
That's not the way
you propose to someone.

02:18:53.199 --> 02:18:55.166
This is.

02:18:58.705 --> 02:19:00.763
Carrie Bradshaw...

02:19:01.474 --> 02:19:02.838
...love of my life...

02:19:05.743 --> 02:19:07.768
...will you marry me?

02:19:12.651 --> 02:19:14.981
See, this is why there's a diamond.

02:19:15.154 --> 02:19:17.281
You need to do something
to close the deal.

02:19:41.847 --> 02:19:43.040
And forsaking all others...

02:19:43.216 --> 02:19:47.117
And in the end, Carrie Bradshaw
married John James Preston...

02:19:47.287 --> 02:19:48.949
...in a label-less dress.
- I do.

02:19:49.421 --> 02:19:52.084
Then by the power vested in me
by the state of New York...

02:19:52.260 --> 02:19:56.820
...I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

02:20:07.439 --> 02:20:09.405
Ever thine. Ever mine.

02:20:10.210 --> 02:20:12.871
Ever ours.

02:20:15.315 --> 02:20:17.645
So you're okay that it was just us?

02:20:17.816 --> 02:20:22.378
It was perfect. You and me, like I said.

02:20:22.556 --> 02:20:25.819
Still, it would have been nice
if you had the girls here.

02:20:27.493 --> 02:20:29.893
Which is why I called them.

02:20:34.202 --> 02:20:36.895
- Hi, Carrie!
- Mazel tov!

02:20:40.105 --> 02:20:43.200
- Ham and eggs. Ham and eggs for you, sir.
- Yup, that's me.

02:20:43.376 --> 02:20:46.035
It wasn't a fancy, designer reception either.

02:20:46.579 --> 02:20:48.706
Just food and friends.

02:20:50.917 --> 02:20:52.781
Butter, ma'am?

02:20:55.055 --> 02:20:56.749
How's the marriage going?

02:21:16.943 --> 02:21:22.107
"And as I put the wedding gown away,
I couldn't help but wonder:

02:21:22.282 --> 02:21:26.481
'Why is it that we're willing
to write our own vows...

02:21:26.653 --> 02:21:30.145
...but not our own rules?"'

02:21:30.390 --> 02:21:32.879
And that's just a little something
I'm working on.

02:21:35.329 --> 02:21:37.091
Thank you.

02:21:38.765 --> 02:21:40.424
Oh, my God.

02:21:42.868 --> 02:21:45.495
Maybe some labels
are best left in the closet.

02:21:45.671 --> 02:21:47.196
Maybe when we label people:

02:21:47.375 --> 02:21:51.606
"Bride," "groom," "husband,"
"wife," "married," "single"...

02:21:51.778 --> 02:21:55.270
...we forget to look past the label
to the person.

02:21:56.484 --> 02:21:59.507
- This is delicious.
- Why did we ever stop drinking these?

02:21:59.685 --> 02:22:03.314
- Because everyone else started.
- Well, that one's an oldie but goodie.

02:22:03.490 --> 02:22:06.288
And speaking of an oldie but goodie...

02:22:09.228 --> 02:22:11.322
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

02:22:12.298 --> 02:22:14.322
Wait, wait, wait. A toast.

02:22:14.501 --> 02:22:16.024
To Samantha.

02:22:16.203 --> 02:22:18.966
Fifty and fabulous.

02:22:25.077 --> 02:22:26.909
To us...

02:22:28.649 --> 02:22:29.741
...and the next 50.

02:22:29.917 --> 02:22:32.215
To the next 50.

02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:38.690
And there, in the same city
where they met as girls...

02:22:38.859 --> 02:22:43.190
...four New York women
entered the next phase of their lives...

02:22:43.362 --> 02:22:46.992
...dressed head to toe in love.

02:22:47.635 --> 02:22:49.829
And that's the one label...

02:22:50.006 --> 02:22:53.201
...that never goes out of style.

02:23:02.416 --> 02:23:07.232
