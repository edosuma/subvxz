WEBVTT

00:13.981 --> 00:16.621
Initiate video. I need to
speak with him immediately.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.300
Location unknown,

00:22.456 --> 00:26.404
but I'm happy to report
the cure does exist.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.238
Yeah, no shit.

00:30.998 --> 00:33.035
Now, can I please have
my to-do list,

00:33.200 --> 00:37.205
so he can enjoy all the credit
and I can get on with it?

01:07.267 --> 01:09.747
We're in a bunker, hiding.
Would you choose diet?

01:09.903 --> 01:13.043
Is there Scotch involved
in this scenario?

01:13.407 --> 01:14.442
There is another way.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.551
Hatake's escape tunnel. We can
get everyone out of the base.

01:17.711 --> 01:20.954
No, that's just it, Sarah.
They will find us, they will kill us all.

01:21.114 --> 01:22.684
And that's not the worst of it.

01:22.849 --> 01:26.092
What we've seen of the virus
so far, it's small-scale.

01:26.253 --> 01:29.598
Ilaria has worldwide ambitions
and we can't let them succeed.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.226
There is no running, no hiding.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.063
Either they survive or we do.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.642
You're healing fast.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.813
Don't worry.
Daniel will be back soon.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.079
A parent always worries.

01:50.143 --> 01:54.649
I'm sure he'll find the last scientists.
For his own sake, I hope not.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.294
It is too late for them.

02:06.259 --> 02:08.830
The others? Did you find Duchamp?

02:19.139 --> 02:20.948
That's Bennett.

02:21.274 --> 02:23.413
That's Chang, Triantis.

02:25.579 --> 02:28.492
I can't help thinking whoever did this...
Was inhuman?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.492
...Was just like me.

02:31.652 --> 02:35.623
From what I can see,
the Scythe is a true sociopath.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.359
Maria's hatchet man.

02:38.191 --> 02:41.832
And yet your father worked
for the very same corporation.

02:42.195 --> 02:43.299
How do you defend that?

02:43.463 --> 02:46.307
I don't. Not anymore.

02:47.934 --> 02:49.777
I need a minute.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.114
We need to keep moving,
keep out of the open.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.683
They could be watching.
I'm hoping

02:58.845 --> 03:01.689
that's exactly what they're doing
and we can lure them out.

03:02.315 --> 03:03.658
Jesus. That's your plan?

03:08.155 --> 03:11.159
I need you down in the cabin.

03:11.324 --> 03:13.531
I've tasked Sarah
with keeping people calm

03:13.694 --> 03:17.301
and organized, but they know you
there and they could use your help.

03:17.464 --> 03:22.675
Given everything I've done,
that may not be the best idea.

03:35.482 --> 03:37.758
I'm still trying to
wrap my head around all this.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.091
Which part? Curing
your incurable cancer,

03:40.253 --> 03:43.359
or figuring out what to do
with the next thousand years?

03:43.523 --> 03:45.332
Heh.
Sorry. It's not funny.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.699
No, it kind of is.

03:48.361 --> 03:51.433
I'm really grateful to you
for saving my life.

03:51.598 --> 03:54.101
There's something to be said
for never having a cold

03:54.267 --> 03:56.713
or getting to work in the hot lab
without gloves.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.749
Not to mention looking like
you're 26 forever.

03:59.906 --> 04:03.012
That's how this works?
I understand it on a cellular level,

04:03.176 --> 04:05.782
but Hatake telling me
he was born in 1501?

04:05.946 --> 04:07.755
That makes him 513.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.360
Man doesn't look a day over 500.

04:14.888 --> 04:18.700
All I've ever wanted
was to make my mark on the world.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.304
You know, put my name on something
that really changed people's lives.

04:23.463 --> 04:25.067
And I know this may sound naive,

04:25.265 --> 04:28.906
but I feel like, with enough time,
we can do anything.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.106
It's a lot of options to consider.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.807
I know.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.917
People don't like
what they don't understand.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.785
We'll have to hide what we are,
not just from ilaria,

04:39.946 --> 04:41.482
but the rest of the world.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.992
Everyone around us
will eventually die.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.758
Friends, family...
I don't know if I can handle that.

04:47.921 --> 04:51.232
Let's hope we get the chance.
Next 12 hours, ilaria is gonna try

04:51.391 --> 04:54.270
and wipe this base off the face
of the Earth with us inside.

05:08.308 --> 05:12.085
We made good time today.
Nearly 40 kilometers. We rest here.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.748
At dawn, split into smaller groups
to hide our numbers.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.322
Take off in four-hour intervals,
maintain radio silence,

05:18.485 --> 05:20.590
then meet at the rendezvous
in Nunavut.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.325
Don't leave it.
Speaks like he's one of us.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.630
A little help here.
We all just fall in line, no questions?

05:26.793 --> 05:28.033
He may not be one of us,

05:28.195 --> 05:31.005
but he's a born leader
with tactical skills we need.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.337
I don't think it's his tactics
you're admiring.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.338
I'm not blind to his faults.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.179
But he knows ilaria Corporation
and their methods.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.182
It's because he's one of them.
He's a hired gun.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.843
He doesn't have any loyalties.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.455
He saved my life.
He saved our people.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.319
You think we're that special
to him?

05:47.480 --> 05:50.723
A couple days out on the ice gonna
make him forget who he really is?

05:50.884 --> 05:52.557
No.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.522
But I trust him.

05:56.623 --> 05:57.863
Go, this way.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.230
And what if you're wrong?

06:02.162 --> 06:05.336
Then I'll gut the son of a bitch myself.

06:19.646 --> 06:23.651
I got something. From six hours ago.

06:26.820 --> 06:30.233
- My God, he's young.
- His name is Spencer Chissik,

06:30.390 --> 06:34.566
but he prefers the name
of his weapon of choice, a scythe.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.175
And this child is responsible
for all those people on the elevator?

06:38.331 --> 06:40.277
Don't let his appearance deceive you.

06:40.433 --> 06:43.539
He has spent centuries perfecting
the art of human suffering.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.248
We would be foolish
to underestimate him.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.943
Well, we have one advantage.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.715
They will underestimate us.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.059
Where are they?

06:58.919 --> 07:00.796
They're in Hatake's office.

07:01.254 --> 07:05.430
It's too easy. Why are they just
walking around in the open like that?

07:05.592 --> 07:07.799
Perhaps their curiosity
got the best of them.

07:08.194 --> 07:10.640
No, Hatake's too smart for that.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.610
Would someone please shut her up?

07:27.414 --> 07:28.620
Oh, my God.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.951
I...

07:32.085 --> 07:33.996
- What is it?
- Security footage,

07:34.154 --> 07:36.225
from four days ago.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.061
It's Sutton.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.469
Show me.
I'm so...

07:41.628 --> 07:43.164
Show me.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.460
I'm so sorry.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.996
I will avenge my mother.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.217
No. This way <i>I</i> can keep a running tab.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.489
I think you should hear this.

08:40.553 --> 08:44.126
Our friends are about to lead us
to what we came for.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.405
<i>- It will never work.</i>
<i>- Why not?</i>

08:49.562 --> 08:51.371
<i>Looks like there's only three of them.</i>

08:51.898 --> 08:54.970
Even the remaining vectors
have more sense than you.

08:55.135 --> 08:58.673
They are hiding, as we should be.
Is that true?

08:58.838 --> 09:00.044
No sign of them anywhere.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.676
We are in this situation because
you brought Narvik back to the base.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.914
Without the Narvik,
there wouldn't be a cure.

09:06.079 --> 09:10.050
Now we have both.
Ilaria has invested tens of millions.

09:10.216 --> 09:14.255
They will not allow Narvik
or the cure to be destroyed.

09:14.421 --> 09:17.561
Well, it's a good thing
we're not asking their permission.

09:18.224 --> 09:21.728
Here's the plan. Daniel,
you'll create a base-wide diversion.

09:21.895 --> 09:25.604
Hatake and I will go after
and retrieve the virus and cure.

09:25.765 --> 09:27.540
Then it's a race to the incinerator.

09:28.668 --> 09:31.672
<i>Agreed. It's a bold
plan, but it should work.</i>

09:31.838 --> 09:33.749
Hiroshi.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.751
Taking orders in your own home.

09:37.677 --> 09:39.122
I almost feel sorry for him.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.126
What do you want us to do?

09:41.247 --> 09:44.091
Suit up. Let's finish
what my mother started.

10:08.074 --> 10:09.280
You and I need to talk.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.586
Good idea. Let's wait until
Nunavut, where ifs warmer.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.425
I want you to stay away
from my sister.

10:18.418 --> 10:19.795
You wanna ask her about that.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.933
She won't listen to me.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.259
What makes you think I will?

10:24.424 --> 10:26.563
My sister thinks
she can change you.

10:26.726 --> 10:29.639
But you and I,
we know the truth.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.106
Yeah? What's that?

10:32.265 --> 10:34.905
That you don't give a shit
about anybody but yourself.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.612
Yep. I'm out here risking my life
because I enjoy the scenery.

10:38.771 --> 10:41.775
You're doing this for Anana?
Because you care?

10:42.175 --> 10:45.281
What does it matter why I do this?
Because you're gonna hurt her.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.456
Maybe not tomorrow.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.592
But you will.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.756
Maybe she wants to get hurt.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.760
Maybe you should get on
that snowmobile and keep riding.

10:57.423 --> 10:59.460
You know, you kind of remind me
of someone.

11:03.496 --> 11:07.945
If you truly care about her,
you'll go.

11:18.778 --> 11:22.726
Can you hand me a torque wrench
and a three-eighth socket?

11:22.882 --> 11:24.987
It's the one that looks like, uh...

11:28.054 --> 11:30.660
Heh. Thank you.

11:31.791 --> 11:34.863
You think Alan's plan's gonna work?
Think they were watching us?

11:35.028 --> 11:39.135
I'm sure they were. I never thought
I'd be wishing I was back in Bolivia.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.178
Bolivia. Capital is Sucre.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.076
Major export, petroleum gas.

11:44.237 --> 11:47.980
You've been?
No. Uh, Encyclopedia Britannica.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.251
Hatake gave me one
for my 7th birthday.

11:51.077 --> 11:52.147
You grew up here?

11:54.214 --> 11:56.057
Yeah. Never left.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.257
Not even to travel?
I never left,

11:58.418 --> 12:02.264
because I believed in
Hatake and his work.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.699
I thought I was somehow part of it,
but everything he did was for you.

12:06.025 --> 12:08.005
Daniel, I...
it's not your fault.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.265
I chose to stay.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.608
And when all this is done, I'm gone.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.945
If we get out of this,

12:17.537 --> 12:20.211
I just want you to know
you can treat me like a sister.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.276
Thank you.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.592
But I already have one.

12:30.216 --> 12:32.127
We need to get going.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.369
You risk too much.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.099
Spencer is centuries old,

12:45.265 --> 12:46.642
an expert in tactics.

12:46.799 --> 12:49.575
Rather go on the offensive
than sit around waiting to die.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.545
You're impetuous like your brother.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.308
Don't bring him into this.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.453
I've met many men like you.

12:56.042 --> 12:59.285
They are only able
to see what is now,

12:59.445 --> 13:01.322
not what is coming
over the horizon.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.392
You're so consumed
with the long view,

13:03.549 --> 13:05.756
you can't see
what's right in front of you.

13:07.053 --> 13:11.627
I have dedicated many lifetimes
trying to engineer the virus

13:12.659 --> 13:16.072
to give humanity the greatest gift.

13:17.096 --> 13:19.133
Immortality.

13:19.832 --> 13:24.008
Even if it were true,
how is that your gift to give?

13:24.904 --> 13:30.616
An end to suffering,
disease, war and death.

13:30.943 --> 13:32.445
We will change the world.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.684
Gunnar suffered, went insane,
killed himself.

13:35.848 --> 13:37.987
You murdered Sutton.

13:38.151 --> 13:43.464
How has your immortality
improved your humanity at all?

13:44.691 --> 13:46.466
You do not understand.

13:46.926 --> 13:50.100
Biohazard. Biohazard.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.436
There's the diversion.
Biohazard.

13:52.598 --> 13:54.669
Biohazard.
Let's get the virus.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.652
Stay where you are.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.557
Put your hands
where I can see them.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.502
Hiroshi.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.362
Spencer.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.565
Don't ever call me that.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.510
You know what I want.

15:02.335 --> 15:07.444
I only know you are as foolish now
as when we first met.

15:09.008 --> 15:11.784
A 15-year-old still clinging
to his mother's skirts.

15:11.944 --> 15:15.016
Yes, my poor mother.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.424
You will answer to the board
for her.

15:18.851 --> 15:21.627
But first, my virus.

15:29.395 --> 15:30.430
Come and get it.

16:16.108 --> 16:17.917
What happened?
Did the trap work?

16:18.077 --> 16:20.421
We got one of them.
Spencer is still alive.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.253
Well, it's one less
we have to deal with.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.019
The other two are meaningless.

16:24.350 --> 16:27.160
We had our chance.
We will not have another.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.993
Can't stand around discussing this.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.431
We need to get back to the cabin.
Just hide?

16:31.591 --> 16:33.127
We have the virus, cure and food.

16:33.292 --> 16:36.273
If Spencer's like Sutton,
I'll take my chances in the cabin.

16:36.462 --> 16:38.999
It's settled. We go downstairs.
No more traps.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.150
I can't believe Thea would fall for that.

16:46.305 --> 16:47.443
She was reckless.

16:47.607 --> 16:50.451
She underestimated Hatake,
as did my mother.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.694
Why allow Hatake into her room
in the first place?

16:59.852 --> 17:00.956
Speak clearly.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.724
What threw Sutton off?

17:02.889 --> 17:04.232
Why didn't she just kill him?

17:08.794 --> 17:11.741
<i>Yet you were willing to
throw it all away. For what?</i>

17:11.897 --> 17:14.377
<i>This abomination?</i>

17:16.469 --> 17:17.675
<i>Was it worth it?</i>

17:17.837 --> 17:20.477
<i>Chasing the Willis hypothesis
to protect your daughter?</i>

17:22.174 --> 17:23.311
"Your daughter"?

17:23.476 --> 17:26.047
How? That's impossible.
What's the Willis hypothesis?

17:26.212 --> 17:27.555
The ravings of a madman,

17:27.713 --> 17:31.820
one who can no longer be allowed
to propagate his insane ideals.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.099
Listen to me, Blake, my love.

17:41.494 --> 17:44.168
I have a very important job for you.

17:45.831 --> 17:48.607
I need you to figure out
everything you can

17:48.768 --> 17:50.907
about that daughter.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.208
Now.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.214
Level B.

17:58.377 --> 18:00.755
It's almost over, Jules.

18:01.847 --> 18:04.919
I wish I believed that.
<i>Level</i> C.

18:06.285 --> 18:07.559
So do I.

18:08.888 --> 18:12.358
It felt good to say it, anyway.

18:15.294 --> 18:16.932
What was that?
Breaker must have tripped.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.542
Service error.
Happens about once a month.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.407
You sure that's all it is?
Service error.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.776
<i>Service error.</i>

18:40.252 --> 18:41.788
Hey.

18:42.588 --> 18:44.124
Somethings wrong.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.497
They should be back by now.
I know.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.503
We should look for them.
"No one in, no one out," Alan said.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.573
Oh, don't quote Alan's rules
back to me.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.836
I had enough of that growing up.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.606
Has he always been
such a stickler?

18:56.769 --> 18:58.077
Are you kidding?

18:58.237 --> 19:01.650
We got in a fight once because
I pulled one of those tags off a pillow.

19:05.177 --> 19:07.350
I'm sure they'll be back soon.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.152
And if not? What then?

19:09.682 --> 19:10.786
Alan will be back.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.025
How do you know?

19:13.753 --> 19:15.596
Because I know.

19:19.692 --> 19:22.832
You really care for him, don't you?
I do.

19:23.295 --> 19:24.433
He's my mentor.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.005
Your mentor.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.346
That's why you came up here
even though you're sick?

19:31.504 --> 19:33.142
I came up here
because ifs my job.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.279
Right.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.821
Why did you come up here?

19:41.614 --> 19:43.651
To run away
after you slept with Julia?

19:46.986 --> 19:49.466
I slept with Julia
because I loved her.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.967
<i>Service error.</i>

20:02.902 --> 20:05.143
Where's Julia?
<i>Level</i> D.

20:08.174 --> 20:09.517
She was right next to me.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.746
How the hell did she get out?
He has her.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.416
Then we have to go back upstairs.

20:15.581 --> 20:18.562
No. He knows
she is my daughter.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.494
<i>Level D.</i>
We must follow Spencer's rules now.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.533
And leave her there with that lunatic?
Of course not.

20:25.324 --> 20:28.931
They will only inflict more pain.

20:29.662 --> 20:30.766
We must wait.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.120
I have to go back up.

20:44.510 --> 20:47.514
We can't just sit around
waiting for some list of demands.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.524
I told you.
We must not provoke him further.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.720
I don't want to.
I wanna rip his head off.

20:52.885 --> 20:53.955
As do I.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.963
But that is what he wants.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.430
To unbalance us.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.729
He's succeeding.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.371
Be patient, then.

21:01.527 --> 21:04.303
Spencer will come when he's ready.

21:35.761 --> 21:38.332
"To the traitor Hiroshi."

22:02.588 --> 22:03.828
No.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.033
We're all gonna die.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.373
Everybody, just quiet!

22:23.309 --> 22:24.982
Move aside.

22:25.144 --> 22:28.182
This is exactly
what the Scythe wants.

22:28.480 --> 22:32.451
You once told me, to react in
anger is to act against yourself.

22:32.618 --> 22:36.225
That was before my daughter's
safety was threatened.

22:36.388 --> 22:38.698
Perhaps one day,

22:38.858 --> 22:42.203
when you have a family of your own...
I thought I did.

22:44.897 --> 22:48.367
You cannot stop me.
Maybe not. But I can slow you down.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.036
Stop it. Stop it.

22:50.636 --> 22:53.583
We're playing
right into his hands.

22:54.173 --> 22:57.677
Are you telling me you would not
sacrifice your own life for Julia?

22:57.843 --> 23:01.381
Of course I would,
unless there were any other way.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.827
What did the note say again?

23:11.023 --> 23:15.096
"She has nine more fingers,
but I only had one mother.

23:15.261 --> 23:17.263
Come directly to Isolation.

23:17.429 --> 23:21.536
The longer you wait,
the less of your daughter will be left."

23:22.368 --> 23:26.180
This is between Spencer and me.
I will go to him.

23:26.338 --> 23:27.783
Alone.
That's suicide.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.716
- There is no other way.
- He's right.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.590
He has to go alone
or Julia dies.

23:33.746 --> 23:37.091
She's dead either way. You think
he's just gonna let her walk out?

23:37.249 --> 23:42.198
No, but I'll be damned if I'm letting
that, that boy do any more harm to her.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.101
What did you do?
What did I do when?

23:56.568 --> 23:58.275
Stop it.
Not till you tell me

23:58.437 --> 24:01.543
what you said to Sergio.
I didn't say anything.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.446
Don't lie to me.
Qamut saw you two talking last night.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.922
I was only looking out for you.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.755
Who asked you to?
He's not one of us.

24:11.917 --> 24:14.090
He is not one of anybody.

24:14.586 --> 24:17.294
He was helping us, you idiot!

24:17.456 --> 24:19.060
Stop, Anana.

24:19.224 --> 24:21.329
Hey, over here.

24:21.493 --> 24:22.665
People don't change.

24:23.329 --> 24:24.933
He would've turned on us.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.971
You're wrong about him.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.578
You and Miksa both.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.150
That should be good.

24:38.344 --> 24:40.790
The halothane gas
system is confined to the ducts

24:40.946 --> 24:42.584
by a series of metal louvers.

24:42.781 --> 24:44.021
Now, if we can divert the gas,

24:44.183 --> 24:47.357
we could knock them all out
and get Dr. Walker back.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.795
The louvers
will need to be reset manually,

24:50.956 --> 24:53.994
which means somebody will need
to go back up into the ducts.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.332
- I've been there. I'll go.
- I'll go with you.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.874
No, no, Peter, you are still recovering.
I'm fine.

25:00.032 --> 25:03.946
Besides, who knows his way around
those ducts better than me?

25:10.976 --> 25:13.820
You're willing to give up
everything for Julia?

25:13.979 --> 25:15.117
Even your own life?

25:15.280 --> 25:17.783
Yes, of course. She's my daughter.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.827
And if it were your son?

25:21.020 --> 25:22.124
You know the answer.

25:22.287 --> 25:26.133
And yet you built this place
for a daughter,

25:26.291 --> 25:29.704
and then lied to your son about it.
Daniel...

25:29.862 --> 25:30.897
Miksa, I...

25:31.063 --> 25:33.509
You don't need to explain.
She's your blood.

25:37.569 --> 25:38.980
You've been a good son.

25:40.806 --> 25:43.047
I wish I could have been
a better father.

26:09.368 --> 26:11.109
Ah-ah-ah!

26:13.705 --> 26:16.777
I would not do that
if I were you.

26:18.744 --> 26:22.248
Mercury sensors are attached
to the trigger mechanism.

26:22.848 --> 26:25.294
Any sudden movement
and the device will go off.

26:29.721 --> 26:31.223
What is this thing?

26:31.390 --> 26:34.269
Simple explosive fitted to a collar.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.869
A little trick I picked up
from the Colombians.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.406
Why?

26:40.566 --> 26:42.239
See, your father,

26:42.401 --> 26:47.407
he's quite fond of separating
people from their heads.

26:47.573 --> 26:49.246
I figured I'd return the favor.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.099
You're worried about him.

27:08.927 --> 27:10.235
I'm worried about all of us.

27:11.830 --> 27:14.310
If it was my father...
He's not my real father.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.177
He's the man who stole me
from my family.

27:17.336 --> 27:18.940
What kind of a monster
does that?

27:19.104 --> 27:22.984
The same man who's out there
right now risking his life for Julia.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.482
That doesn't excuse what he did.
No, it doesn't.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.656
But I'm sure he would do
the same for you.

27:30.616 --> 27:32.857
You sound like you're on his side.

27:33.018 --> 27:35.294
I'm not taking any sides.

27:36.021 --> 27:38.023
But even monsters
have their reasons.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.047
There's a T-intersection up ahead

28:01.680 --> 28:04.854
- and that's where the louvers are.
- No, I don't think so.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.562
It's a dead end up there.
You wanna lead?

28:07.719 --> 28:10.393
Hey, I've spent a lot more time
up here than you.

28:10.556 --> 28:14.299
Well, you should have thought
of that before we got in here.

28:16.795 --> 28:18.706
This reminds me
of hiding in the attic

28:18.864 --> 28:20.969
when the old man
was on one of his benders.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.306
Well, that was usually me hiding.

28:23.468 --> 28:27.507
You were more often
in the line of fire.

28:27.673 --> 28:29.584
I did have a knack
for getting in his way.

28:29.741 --> 28:33.518
You're right, it's a dead end.
Told you.

28:33.679 --> 28:37.422
In case you're interested,
T-intersection's down here.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.837
I guess you did
spend some time up here.

28:53.932 --> 28:58.210
I was, uh, infected.

28:58.870 --> 29:01.373
I don't really remember this.

29:01.773 --> 29:03.377
Uh-huh.

29:06.111 --> 29:07.681
Hatake.

29:07.846 --> 29:10.918
Are you in position?
Almost there.

29:17.589 --> 29:18.727
Yes, it's cramped.

29:18.890 --> 29:21.734
Yes, were hungry, and we could
probably all use a hot shower.

29:21.893 --> 29:24.567
If you wanna take your chances
out there, go right ahead.

29:24.730 --> 29:26.732
Otherwise, please be patient.

29:26.898 --> 29:28.775
We're not the enemy.

29:29.735 --> 29:31.476
Daniel...

29:34.406 --> 29:36.113
Daniel.

29:47.919 --> 29:48.954
Daniel?

30:23.455 --> 30:25.526
I have what you want.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.339
Feels like it hasn't been opened
in years.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.141
Dad may have been an angry prick,
but he was right about one thing:

30:35.300 --> 30:36.938
Always bring WD-40.
Heh.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.813
Let's try it from the bottom.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.480
I think we'll get better leverage
up here.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.849
What are you doing? From the bottom.
Hey.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.719
Just because it's not your way
doesn't make it wrong.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.052
You never listen.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.886
Are you kidding? That's all I do.

30:54.052 --> 30:55.554
You never take me seriously.

30:55.721 --> 30:58.031
Yeah? That is not true.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.567
Then let's try it my way.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.800
From the top.

31:25.917 --> 31:30.093
Hatake, the last of the vents is
open and we're ready for the gas.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.370
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

31:33.992 --> 31:35.198
<i>Do you copy me?</i>

31:35.360 --> 31:36.668
<i>The vent is open,</i>

31:36.828 --> 31:39.741
<i>and we're ready
for the halothane gas.</i>

31:40.866 --> 31:43.540
Dr. Hatake, can you read me?

31:43.702 --> 31:45.875
What's he waiting for?

31:46.037 --> 31:47.516
Hatake?

31:47.672 --> 31:49.743
<i>Do you read me?</i>

31:51.243 --> 31:53.245
<i>I repeat, the vent is open.</i>

31:53.412 --> 31:55.756
<i>We're ready for the gas.</i>

32:07.626 --> 32:09.628
- Spencer.
- Hiroshi.

32:09.795 --> 32:11.274
Took you long enough.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.967
Just about to slice off
another piece of your daughter.

32:14.132 --> 32:16.476
Just 20 seconds shy.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.410
Thank you.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.777
You can run along now.
Go check on our friend.

32:27.245 --> 32:31.557
Let Julia go and you can
do with me as you please.

32:31.950 --> 32:35.659
I will not fight you.
That's very generous of you.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.799
Sacrificing yourself
for a loved one.

32:38.957 --> 32:42.063
There's nothing quite like a bond
between a parent and a child.

32:42.594 --> 32:47.270
I know that now
since you took my mother from me.

32:51.436 --> 32:54.974
My life for hers.

32:56.074 --> 32:57.178
I'm begging you.

33:00.145 --> 33:02.182
It doesn't quite look like
you're begging.

33:02.981 --> 33:06.121
Try again,
but this time on your knees.

33:21.099 --> 33:22.840
Please.

33:24.436 --> 33:27.042
Let my daughter live.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.645
You know,
I never thought I'd see the day.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.351
But ifs just the beginning.

33:42.487 --> 33:45.491
Behind the glass, your daughter.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.329
But wait.

33:57.235 --> 33:58.714
Daniel.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.723
This is barbaric,

34:18.422 --> 34:20.061
even by your standards.

34:20.225 --> 34:21.761
You will answer to the board.

34:21.927 --> 34:24.498
Where was your concern for them
when you killed Mother?

34:24.663 --> 34:28.007
She would have killed me.
Only had you let her.

34:28.333 --> 34:31.074
It would have spared you
the decision you now have to make.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.786
What do you want? The virus?

34:40.946 --> 34:43.358
I already have the virus.

34:43.514 --> 34:46.860
What I want is for you
to make a choice.

34:47.886 --> 34:52.527
One lives and one dies.
It's completely up to you.

34:57.963 --> 35:00.534
I refuse to play your sick game.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.269
I think you will,

35:02.434 --> 35:04.573
because, see, if you fail to choose,

35:06.605 --> 35:08.414
I kill both of them.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.647
Oh, and what fun is a game

35:10.809 --> 35:12.720
if it's not against the clock?

35:14.879 --> 35:16.790
So who will it be?

35:16.948 --> 35:19.428
The miracle
that is your biological daughter,

35:19.584 --> 35:24.055
or your loyal son,
who dedicated his life to you?

35:25.557 --> 35:27.503
You will kill them both.

35:27.659 --> 35:30.469
I will not.
One of them loses their head

35:30.629 --> 35:33.075
and one of them goes free.
That is a promise.

35:36.234 --> 35:39.306
No. I cannot.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.246
You will.
I will not!

35:41.406 --> 35:42.817
Say goodbye to your children.

35:42.974 --> 35:46.649
Stop. You don't have to choose.
Daniel?

35:48.446 --> 35:51.450
- There is no decision to make.
- Daniel, please.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.124
Don't do anything foolish.

35:53.451 --> 35:55.294
I love you, Father.

35:55.453 --> 35:57.455
I always will.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.096
And I forgive you.
Daniel!

36:28.119 --> 36:29.325
Daniel.

36:33.725 --> 36:36.296
That make you feel powerful?
No, but this does.

37:20.705 --> 37:22.378
Mom?
