00:06.480 --> 00:07.320
[Jermaine] Today?

00:07.400 --> 00:08.760
[light piano music playing]

00:08.840 --> 00:10.920
Well, then how you only callin' me now,
bruv?

00:11.000 --> 00:13.120
- [man] How long you gonna be?
- [whispers] One sec.

00:15.320 --> 00:16.280
All right.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.360
Yeah, yeah. It'll be cool, it'll be cool,
it'll be cool, I'll get on it.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.360
Where?

00:21.560 --> 00:22.440
Hmm.

00:23.480 --> 00:26.480
Yeah, I know where that is.
My gran got her cataracts done there.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.320
We'll be there, don't worry.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.920
Bruv! Oi, look, listen.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.320
Oi, don't start stressin' out now, yeah?
And then stressin' me out.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.560
I told you I'll be there, I'll be there.
Aight?

00:41.440 --> 00:42.360
All right.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.440
- Bro.
- One second, yeah? I need to make a call.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.400
I thought this was supposed
to be about me.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.800
- This is my time, bro.
- [waiter] Everything okay, sir?

00:52.880 --> 00:54.160
Yes, thanks. Everything's good.

00:54.240 --> 00:55.720
Can I get you anything else?

00:56.040 --> 00:56.880
[Jermaine] No.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you think you're doin'?

01:02.160 --> 01:03.640
Does that look finished to you?

01:03.880 --> 01:05.920
When I'm finished, I'll let you know.
Thank you.

01:07.240 --> 01:09.640
Listen, this is about you.
It's all about you.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.720
Why do you think we're here?
Look at this place.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.480
Just gimme two minutes, yeah?
Gimme two minutes, bruv.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.560
It's what agents do,
we make calls, innit?

01:16.640 --> 01:17.960
[ringing tone]

01:18.040 --> 01:18.880
Yeah.

01:19.600 --> 01:20.680
Yes, today, bruv.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.840
Yeah, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know,

01:24.920 --> 01:27.080
but he just called me now, innit,
so what can I do?

01:28.720 --> 01:30.080
You know what to do, innit?

01:30.440 --> 01:32.440
Yeah. Get the stuff
and then pick me up at my office.

01:36.120 --> 01:39.520
What do you mean when, bruv? Now.
They're takin' him into reception now.

01:41.040 --> 01:44.560
Yes. Please. Quick as you can.
Aight, safe, bro. Thank you.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.360
Look.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.920
As long as I got my phone, yeah,
I make anywhere my office, yeah?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.120
This is where I like to bring
my top clients, like you,

01:52.200 --> 01:55.800
for our business meetings so we can,
you know, flex a little.

01:55.880 --> 01:56.960
You know what I mean?

01:57.280 --> 01:59.040
You just said someone's
comin' to pick you up.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.920
Come on, fam, don't worry about that.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.720
Look, I've always got time for you.
All right?

02:03.800 --> 02:05.240
Now, come on, tell me.

02:05.440 --> 02:07.160
[inhales sharply] What's goin' on?

02:12.120 --> 02:13.840
[electric kettle bubbling]

02:15.080 --> 02:16.480
[murmuring]

02:16.840 --> 02:18.440
Coffee ain't even here, fam.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.200
'Cause all this shit is there.

02:21.920 --> 02:22.920
[sighs]

02:25.680 --> 02:26.560
[chuckles]

02:27.600 --> 02:28.720
I can't believe it.

02:29.640 --> 02:30.680
It's all tea!

02:32.080 --> 02:33.480
Ah, man. Come on.

02:37.680 --> 02:38.680
[sighs]

02:40.280 --> 02:41.160
[tsks]

02:47.600 --> 02:48.640
[Tish] Hi, Dushane.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.800
- Whoa.
- How are you?

02:51.480 --> 02:53.840
Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm good. How are you?

02:54.240 --> 02:56.320
I slept very well, thank you.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.080
This is my kitchen.

02:59.880 --> 03:00.960
[Dushane] Okay.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.560
Excuse me.

03:02.880 --> 03:05.840
Mum thinks it's hers, but it's mine.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.760
Have you got any coffee in your kitchen?

03:07.840 --> 03:10.560
I'm afraid not. I don't drink coffee.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.720
Oh, yeah. Too young, innit?

03:12.800 --> 03:14.680
Did you have a sleepover?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.360
Yeah.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.560
Yeah, a sleepover.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.400
I have sleepovers here sometimes
with my friends.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.440
- Mm.
- Mum doesn't have sleepovers.

03:23.520 --> 03:24.560
Okay.

03:27.880 --> 03:28.920
Let me help you with that.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.680
You tell me when, okay?

03:36.120 --> 03:37.720
- When.
- There you go.

03:38.040 --> 03:38.880
Enjoy.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.160
Thank you, Dushane.

03:40.240 --> 03:41.320
That's okay.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.760
See you later.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.320
[Tish humming in background]

03:57.800 --> 03:58.760
Hey.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.320
Wake up.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.080
Babe.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.600
- Tea.
- What time is it?

04:07.880 --> 04:09.200
Chill, man. Don't worry. Here.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.000
Oh, I gotta get Tish ready for school.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.720
Don't worry about Tish, she's fine.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.920
She downstairs eatin' breakfast,
she's good.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.519
It's hot. Be careful.

04:16.959 --> 04:18.160
She saw you?

04:18.240 --> 04:19.360
Yeah. [chuckles]

04:19.560 --> 04:20.560
[Shelley sighs]

04:20.640 --> 04:21.640
What did she say?

04:21.720 --> 04:22.840
Oh, I don't know.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.120
She thought I was Black Panther
or something.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.800
Started screamin', 'Wakanda!'

04:28.120 --> 04:29.560
I'm only joking.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.040
But she did say...
you ain't got no coffee in your kitchen.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.240
What's all that about?
What type of kitchen is that?

04:36.840 --> 04:37.840
What's wrong?

04:39.960 --> 04:42.240
No one's ever brought me tea
in the mornin' before.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.360
Well, you know,
I know how to spoil a woman.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.400
Nah, I got mornin' breath.

04:50.840 --> 04:53.440
All I can smell is that fuckin' weird tea.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.240
Last night...

05:06.200 --> 05:07.400
This...

05:10.680 --> 05:12.320
It's a bit of a surprise, innit?

05:13.920 --> 05:15.560
It's a good surprise, though.

05:15.880 --> 05:16.760
Right?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.440
Well, you seem happier.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.080
Where's my phone?

05:37.960 --> 05:39.280
[Dushane sighs] Oh, man.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.280
[indistinct chatter in courtyard]

05:47.280 --> 05:48.480
Bless, my brother.

05:57.480 --> 06:00.240
[seagulls squawking]

06:04.320 --> 06:06.320
[train passing by]

06:22.920 --> 06:23.800
[Stefan] Yo.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.000
Has Jaq called you yet?

06:34.080 --> 06:35.080
She ain't called.

06:35.760 --> 06:36.720
What are you gonna do?

06:36.800 --> 06:38.680
- What are you askin' me for?
- What?

06:38.760 --> 06:41.440
- It's your fault we're in this.
- You asked me to come with you.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.440
- Fact, you begged me to come with you.
- No, I never.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.960
Now you're tryin' to blame it on me.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.720
If you hadn't gone to Jaq
in the first place

06:46.800 --> 06:48.360
- none of this would've happened.
- It's you.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.560
You was the one holdin' the bag.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.160
- You need to pay Jaq the money.
- Are you mad?

06:51.240 --> 06:52.480
Why don't you ask Jamie for it?

06:52.560 --> 06:54.520
- He has Ps.
- Fam, if Jamie found out what we're doin'

06:54.600 --> 06:56.200
- he'll kill me.
- He won't give a shit, man

06:56.280 --> 06:58.080
- How'd you think he makes money?
- Shut up, man!

06:58.160 --> 06:59.800
You're just talkin' rubbish. Just shut up.

06:59.880 --> 07:03.040
Man, you're so dumb.
You think I don't know what Jamie does?

07:03.120 --> 07:05.320
Everyone knows what he does, fam.
Everyone!

07:06.600 --> 07:07.440
[boy] Fight!

07:07.520 --> 07:08.880
[kids clamouring]

07:08.960 --> 07:11.920
[kids chanting] Fight! Fight! Fight!

07:12.000 --> 07:15.320
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

07:15.400 --> 07:17.600
[man] Hey! Oi! You two!

07:17.680 --> 07:18.840
Stop that!

07:20.320 --> 07:21.920
I said stop it!

07:22.000 --> 07:22.880
[kids booing]

07:22.960 --> 07:24.400
- [man] Stefan!
- Ay, shut up, man!

07:24.480 --> 07:26.400
[kids laugh nervously]

07:28.680 --> 07:31.200
I ain't gettin' any respect, bruv.
Three games in a row, I'm on the bench.

07:31.280 --> 07:34.240
- The boss won't even look me in the eye.
- That's mad, bruv.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.960
- Finish what you're sayin'...
- Jermaine, bruv.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.920
- You even listenin' to what I'm tellin'...
- Yes, man.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.240
I'm listenin' to what you're sayin'.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.520
You said that Roy won't look you
in the eye, but fuck him anyway.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.680
- I'm gonna make him look you in the eye.
- You need to tell him about the money.

07:45.760 --> 07:46.680
[Jermaine tsks]

07:46.760 --> 07:49.520
'Cause with the baby on the way and that,
my girl is stressin' me, bro!

07:49.600 --> 07:52.080
I know, the baby.
Bruv, you told me about the baby already.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.600
I know about that, yeah?

07:53.960 --> 07:56.680
Look, look.
You need to provide, all right?

07:56.760 --> 07:59.720
You need to provide for your family.
I get that more than most people.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.440
We're gonna make that
happen together, yeah?

08:02.520 --> 08:03.800
You just need to stay focused.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.760
- [mobile phone vibrates]
- Bruv, where are you?

08:06.240 --> 08:08.640
No, bruv, it's the one at the top,
near the corner.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.560
- Fuck. Listen, don't fuck this up.
- Bro.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.320
If we miss him, we're fucked, all right?

08:13.920 --> 08:15.040
Oh, you see it, yeah?

08:15.680 --> 08:17.040
Aight, cool, cool. Cool, cool.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.320
Look, I'm gonna get Roy
to pay you what's right.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.680
Leave it with me, okay?

08:21.760 --> 08:23.280
- You know Linton?
- [sighs]

08:23.360 --> 08:25.640
You know he's gettin' 2K more than I am,
you know?

08:25.720 --> 08:26.960
- How is that even a thing?
- Bruv!

08:27.040 --> 08:29.200
Look, man. I've had enough
of this shit now, all right?

08:29.280 --> 08:31.280
Stop your fuckin' negative thinkin', okay?

08:31.360 --> 08:33.440
You're one of the best players
I look after by far,

08:33.520 --> 08:35.880
so you're gonna get the money,
I'm gonna get you the money you deserve.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.440
And you're gonna get the respect
you deserve, all right?

08:38.520 --> 08:41.320
Just stay focused. Be patient, all right?

08:42.760 --> 08:43.760
All right.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.280
- What? You're leavin'?
- Yes, bruv.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.440
Look, I gotta go, all right?

08:47.520 --> 08:49.480
But, look, you're gonna be a great dad,
all right?

08:49.560 --> 08:50.400
Come...

08:59.000 --> 08:59.920
What?

09:08.320 --> 09:09.280
Yo.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.280
Yo!

09:11.560 --> 09:12.560
We good?

09:12.640 --> 09:14.400
- [yawns]
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.840
Listen, listen. None of that, yeah?

09:15.920 --> 09:18.760
I need you man awake and on point.
Stop that.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.320
It's all there, my brother.
Under the coat.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.440
[Jermaine breathes rapidly]

09:40.160 --> 09:42.760
What the fuck's goin' on?
Where's the youngers?

09:42.840 --> 09:44.960
- [Dris] They ain't showed up.
- What, none of them?

09:45.760 --> 09:47.960
Fam, no one wants to be on
the losing side.

09:48.040 --> 09:49.680
What're you talkin' about,
'losing side'?

09:49.760 --> 09:51.720
- [tsks]
- [Dris] It's how they see it.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.160
I'm just tellin' you, bro.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.760
Some of 'em started shottin'
for the ZTs already.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.920
- Fuck all that, man.
- You need to get off the roadside, fam.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.040
Stay indoors.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.400
Are you fuckin' mad?

10:01.480 --> 10:04.480
Stay indoors?
You tellin' man what to do now, yeah?

10:04.680 --> 10:07.840
All this losing side shit,
that's bullshit, fam.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.840
- Man's winning out here.
- [tsks]

10:10.760 --> 10:13.200
Get on your phones,
start hollerin' at people.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.880
Find out if there's any new supplier
in town that's got enough food

10:15.960 --> 10:17.760
to give Jamie and them fuckin' ZT pricks.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.520
We did that already, though.
None of the youngers have heard nothin'.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.320
Did you hear me say
anything about youngers?

10:22.400 --> 10:23.760
I'm talkin' about everyone.

10:23.840 --> 10:27.000
Next gang, soldiers, roadmen,
I don't give a shit.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.480
And if that don't work,
fuckin' ask your mum,

10:29.560 --> 10:32.120
or your aunt, your fuckin' uncles.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.200
Or the fuckin' kebab man,
I don't give a shit.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.520
Someone knows somethin'.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.440
When you find that person,
tell 'em to come and see me.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.000
I got P for them.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.920
And find us a base
if you're that fuckin' smart.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.040
Fuckin' slackin', man. Lazy.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.320
Yo!

10:49.800 --> 10:51.680
[Jaq] The fuck you gonna do
with them, bruv?

Go down the Fields, yeah?

11:04.080 --> 11:06.080
Keep your eyes and your ears open.

11:06.440 --> 11:10.080
Anything you see or you hear about
Jamie's supply, you let me know.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.200
Got a hit for you.

11:12.480 --> 11:13.880
We won't let you down, man.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.480
Wait. Can you just give us

11:17.080 --> 11:19.440
I'm gonna give you something now

11:19.520 --> 11:21.240

forget your job.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.720

Get the fuck in the car.

[tyres screeching]

13:19.000 --> 13:19.920
[Modie] Let's go!

13:20.000 --> 13:21.800
[Modie whoops with joy]

13:21.880 --> 13:22.800
Fuck!

13:23.200 --> 13:24.280
Ah!

13:24.520 --> 13:26.800
Oh! [laughs]

13:26.880 --> 13:28.400
[hip hop plays in background]

13:28.480 --> 13:31.240
[Farah] Bruv, take your time
when you're counting that, for real.

13:32.440 --> 13:33.480
[scoffs]

13:33.560 --> 13:35.000
Do the ting properly.

13:36.640 --> 13:37.480
[Si] Dunno, bruv.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.040
You ain't serious, Si,
you're doin' it like that.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.120
[indistinct chatter in background]

14:11.760 --> 14:13.520
[Farah] Count the money properly, bruv.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.040
- Si.
- [Si] Man knows how to count money.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.000
My dad taught me, fam.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.720
- [Farah] Your dad, yeah?
- Yeah.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.200
- Ah! You're messin' up my concentration!
- [Farah] Bruv, me?

14:23.280 --> 14:25.600
- Bruv, the both of you are childish.
- Bruv, me, childish?

14:25.680 --> 14:28.560
- [Kit] Yeah, you.
- Rah, like that? Like that? See that?

14:28.640 --> 14:30.320
Another bag. You know what that means?

14:30.400 --> 14:31.520
[Farah] Shut up, fam.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.640
[Kit] What are you doin'?

14:34.720 --> 14:36.000
Are you seein' this guy?

14:36.080 --> 14:37.800
- That's Ps, fam.
- [laughter]

14:37.880 --> 14:41.040
Chill out, man.
After a bag, man gets a dab, innit?

14:41.120 --> 14:42.520
Another bag, another dab.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.720
Another bag, another dab.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.200
[Kit vocalises] Another! Another dab!

14:47.280 --> 14:48.600
[Tyrone] Ay, ay, ay, ay.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.800
Man a madman.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.480
Hey! I ain't ever seen
this much Ps before.

14:52.560 --> 14:53.840
[Kit] Maybe in Scarface, blud.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.400
- [mobile phone vibrates]
- [Si] Man is carrying so much cash.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.000
- No, no, no, no, no. Fuck, bruv!
- [Kit] What?

15:02.080 --> 15:03.160
Yo, Modie's escaped.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.400
- [Kit] What you talkin' about?
- Fam, it's right there!

15:06.720 --> 15:07.680
[Farah] Fuck.

15:07.760 --> 15:08.840
[Si] Oh, shit.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.640
[Tyrone] So what?
Does that mean Modie's comin' back?

15:11.720 --> 15:13.120
[Kit] What d'you mean, back?

15:13.200 --> 15:14.960
- [Tyrone] To run the Fields?
- Nah, man.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.280
That definitely ain't happenin'.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.240
Blud, he knows if the feds see him,
they'll shoot him dead on sight, blud.

15:19.320 --> 15:20.240
[scoffs]

15:20.680 --> 15:21.520
[tsks]

15:21.600 --> 15:23.000
[indistinct chatter]

15:24.000 --> 15:25.400
[Farah] Bruv, how did he get out?

15:33.640 --> 15:35.680
Fam, you think this is gonna be
a problem for us?

15:36.720 --> 15:37.960
Yeah, man, I do.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.560
Question is, how big?

15:41.600 --> 15:42.800
[Kit sighs]

15:51.680 --> 15:53.080
[dog barking in background]

15:56.560 --> 15:58.440
[Dushane sighs] For fuck's sake.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.040
[Sully sighs]

16:02.640 --> 16:03.720
Come on, man.

16:04.640 --> 16:05.800
Are you takin' the piss?

16:06.160 --> 16:07.320
[Dushane scoffs]

16:07.840 --> 16:09.200
Bruv, call that boy.

16:09.880 --> 16:11.080
- [bag thuds on ground]
- Ay!

16:11.160 --> 16:12.800
[ringing tone]

16:14.760 --> 16:17.400
Ay, yo, Dris!
Are you tryin' to piss me off?

16:19.360 --> 16:22.720
Well, fuckin' somewhere with
a fuckin' bed and heatin' or somethin'!

16:23.920 --> 16:26.320
Bruv, we're gonna have
to fuckin' stay here now, innit?

16:27.320 --> 16:28.720
[Dushane] Dickhead, man. [tsks]

16:30.400 --> 16:33.360
[Sully] If we're gonna stay here,
we need beds.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.840
It's fuckin' freezin' in here as well.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.640
[Ricky] Got man's shop and that.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.680
Say nothin', man, I'll handle that.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.040
Later.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.280
[door shuts]

17:30.040 --> 17:32.320
[string-led ambient music playing]

18:13.840 --> 18:14.920
[exhales sharply]

18:50.040 --> 18:51.200
[door opens]

18:55.600 --> 18:56.440
[door shuts]

18:56.520 --> 18:57.440
[Aaron] Stef?

19:02.600 --> 19:03.960
What are you doin' in here?

19:04.040 --> 19:05.840
You know you shouldn't be in here,
little man.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.200
Why's your face like that?
What's wrong with you?

19:16.760 --> 19:19.080
So, you're not gonna tell me
what's wrong, no?

19:27.200 --> 19:28.960
Jamie's a roadman, ain't he?

19:34.280 --> 19:36.800
- Nah, it ain't like that...
- Don't lie to me! I ain't dumb!

19:40.200 --> 19:45.080
Look, anything we need,
he provides for us, doesn't he?

19:46.120 --> 19:47.000
Right?

19:48.360 --> 19:49.400
Right?

19:58.240 --> 19:59.360
Does he sell drugs?

20:01.440 --> 20:03.600
I don't know. Haven't asked him.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.000
What I know...

20:08.200 --> 20:09.640
is that he pays for the food,

20:10.560 --> 20:12.040
he pays the rent

20:12.120 --> 20:13.360
and he pays the electric.

20:19.160 --> 20:22.720
Ats told me he's a roadman,
and I know what roadmen do.

20:23.960 --> 20:27.320
They sell drugs, they shoot people,
they kill people.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.480
[sighs] Nah, man,
Jamie ain't done none of that.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.480
- And how d'you know that?
- 'Cause he's my brother.

20:34.560 --> 20:35.760
He's my brother, too.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.080
So, what, you think
Jamie just runs around shootin' people?

20:45.840 --> 20:47.040
I don't know that, do I?

20:54.960 --> 20:57.160
Look... [sighs]

20:57.240 --> 20:59.280
All your trainers, your school uniform,

21:00.040 --> 21:01.360
my books for uni,

21:01.880 --> 21:03.320
Jamie pays for all that.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.000
That's all I know.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.320
[Stefan sighs]

21:14.520 --> 21:16.000
Will he get arrested?

21:20.080 --> 21:21.040
No.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.600
He ain't gettin' arrested, all right?

21:27.520 --> 21:29.040
I wish he'd just come home.

21:31.800 --> 21:32.800
[Aaron sighs]

21:42.760 --> 21:43.720
[knocking on door]

21:52.040 --> 21:53.600
- Hi.
- You all right?

21:53.680 --> 21:54.720
Yeah, co... come in.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.480
Didn't think you'd come, you know.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.680
Er, Tasha, come on.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.560
Hey, did you tell her that I was her dad?

22:08.720 --> 22:09.760
Um...

22:09.840 --> 22:12.520
Paul and I decided it was best
if she knew, so we told her last night.

22:14.960 --> 22:15.960
[Taylor] Come on.

22:16.040 --> 22:17.880
- [footsteps on staircase]
- Come on.

22:24.280 --> 22:25.120
You all right?

22:27.480 --> 22:28.640
Got this for you.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.200
[Taylor] That's nice.

22:32.680 --> 22:33.960
What do you say, Tash?

22:35.880 --> 22:36.880
Natasha.

22:37.560 --> 22:38.400
Thanks.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.280
Probably don't remember who I am, do you?

22:44.880 --> 22:47.360
Do you wanna show your dad your bedroom
before you go to sleep?

22:47.760 --> 22:49.080
He's not my dad.

22:50.680 --> 22:53.560
[Taylor] Hey. Listen, do you remember,
what did we talk about last night?

22:53.640 --> 22:54.600
It's not a problem.

22:56.600 --> 22:57.680
Look, Tash...

23:00.400 --> 23:01.240
Natasha...

23:03.200 --> 23:04.200
my name's Sully.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.680
And, um, it's nice to meet you.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.800
[Taylor] What do you say?

23:11.480 --> 23:13.160
She don't have to say anything.

23:16.680 --> 23:17.560
Um...

23:18.760 --> 23:20.240
Yeah, like your mum said, if you...

23:21.320 --> 23:22.160
go to bed,

23:23.720 --> 23:27.160
and, at any moment, you feel like
you want to show me your room,

23:28.520 --> 23:29.840
then I would like that.

23:31.880 --> 23:32.840
All right?

23:35.680 --> 23:37.080
Come on. Bedtime.

23:37.880 --> 23:38.760
Up.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.800
Be down in a minute, okay?

23:40.880 --> 23:41.760
Paul?

23:45.400 --> 23:46.440
Hi, Sully.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.120
I'm Paul.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.240
You all right, man?

23:53.080 --> 23:54.400
- I'll take it.
- Got it?

23:54.480 --> 23:55.520
Mm-hmm.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.520
Thanks.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.640
Yo, T, what did you tell Natasha about me?

24:16.480 --> 24:19.160
We... told her you've been away for work.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.120
Not a complete lie, I suppose.

24:28.840 --> 24:29.800
[Paul] Kids...

24:31.280 --> 24:32.840
You have to be patient, you know?

24:34.360 --> 24:36.040
Sometimes they don't wanna talk,

24:36.320 --> 24:37.320
and later they do.

24:37.680 --> 24:41.000
We want you to feel like you can
have a relationship with Tasha.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.560
Come and see her and spend time with her.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.120
Get to know each other.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.160
If...

24:50.880 --> 24:52.320
that's what you want, of course.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.160
[chuckles]

24:57.600 --> 24:59.880
- What's your game? What d'you want?
- [Taylor] Sully.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.880
Look, Paul and me were talking,

25:07.960 --> 25:09.960
and thought that maybe

25:10.040 --> 25:10.960
the four of us,

25:11.640 --> 25:14.120
me and Paul and you and Tash,

25:14.760 --> 25:16.720
could go out for a day one weekend.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.000
- That's weird. [chuckles]
- [scoffs]

25:19.080 --> 25:20.920
- Okay. Fine.
- What, is that not weird to you?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.440
Yes, yes, of course it's weird,
but at least we're trying.

25:23.520 --> 25:26.000
[Paul] Look, if it helps,
I don't need to come.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.680
It'd just be the three of you.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.680
[Sully chuckles] Really?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
[Taylor sighs, clears throat]

25:35.600 --> 25:37.920
You must have a lot of trust
in your relationship.

25:38.480 --> 25:41.320
- If it's just something like...
- We all trust each other in this house.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.120
[exhales sharply]

25:44.400 --> 25:46.920
You must have found God or something
'cause from what I remember,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.720
- trust weren't exactly your thing.
- Why do you think that was, Sully?

25:50.440 --> 25:51.800
[footsteps]

25:55.320 --> 25:56.920
[Taylor] What are you doin' out of bed?

25:57.360 --> 25:59.360
I've got my necklace on.

26:00.040 --> 26:01.440
[Paul] That looks pretty, Tash.

26:01.880 --> 26:02.720
[Tasha] Oh.

26:03.400 --> 26:06.080
- Thank you.
- Yeah, it does.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.600
Would you like to come see my room?

26:11.960 --> 26:12.960
Yeah.

26:14.120 --> 26:15.680
- You wanna take me there?
- Yeah.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.440
[loud hip hop music playing]

26:26.520 --> 26:28.520
[loud overlapping chatter]

26:35.720 --> 26:37.120
We made it happen!

26:37.720 --> 26:39.440
We made it happen!

26:39.880 --> 26:41.520
[laughter]

26:41.680 --> 26:44.120
[overlapping chatter continues]

26:45.240 --> 26:47.480
- [Jermaine] Ay, yo!
- Who's that on the phone, though?

26:48.040 --> 26:49.120
Is that my sister?

26:49.800 --> 26:50.840
Let me chat to her.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.880
Yeah, look, I gotta go

26:52.960 --> 26:54.960
Yo. Yo! [laughs]

26:55.040 --> 26:57.240
- What you sayin'? Guess who it is?
- Don't say your name.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.480
- You don't know who's listenin'.
- It's your baby brother!

26:59.560 --> 27:03.000
- Bruv, what the fuck did I just say?
- Listen, chill, man. I didn't say my name.

27:03.080 --> 27:06.720
Yo, are you seein' the news right now?
My face is everywhere.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.960
- Sayin' that I'm public enemy number one.
- Bruv!

27:09.040 --> 27:10.640
- Armed and fuckin' dangerous!
- Hey!

27:10.720 --> 27:12.880
[Jermaine] Bruv, give me the phone
and stop fuckin' about!

27:12.960 --> 27:15.440
Look, I'm gonna pass the phone
to your man, yeah?

27:15.520 --> 27:17.000
'Cause he's tweakin' right now, innit?

27:17.080 --> 27:19.240
I'mma chat to you soon.
I'm gonna pass him the phone.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.320
Ay, listen, I need you
to do something for me.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.240
- Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
- Yeah?

27:23.640 --> 27:25.160
- Babe...
- Let's go.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.160
Yeah. No, everything's okay. Don't worry.

27:27.240 --> 27:28.280
Let's go!

27:28.360 --> 27:30.080
- Yeah, I'll call you later.
- [Modie laughs]

27:30.160 --> 27:31.520
I love you, too. Bye.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.000
Bruv, oi, listen.
Don't fuckin' do that again, yeah?

27:34.080 --> 27:36.560
Bro, I need you to do something for me.

27:36.640 --> 27:37.880
- Look...
- Listen to me, bro.

27:37.960 --> 27:38.800
Listen.

27:38.880 --> 27:41.320
Yeah, you listen, yeah?
Bruv, I need to get back to them.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.560
Yeah, and I need to get back
to my business, right?

27:43.640 --> 27:45.040
Business is like a garden, bruv.

27:45.120 --> 27:47.280
If you want it to grow,
you gotta tend to your garden.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.520
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- Where's this gardening shit comin' from?

27:49.600 --> 27:52.680
You're out now, yeah?
So, where's the money, bro?

27:52.760 --> 27:55.600
- One more thing I need you to do.
- No! Just give me my money, man!

27:55.680 --> 27:59.000
Listen to me, bro. Yeah? Listen to me.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.440
[chuckles]

28:00.520 --> 28:04.480
When you help me get Sully,
you'll get your money, bro.

28:04.840 --> 28:07.840
Yeah. I know you. I know you well.

28:07.920 --> 28:13.160
And there's no way that you're gonna miss
when we fuckin' smoke Sully.

28:13.240 --> 28:14.840
- There's no way, bro.
- All right, chill.

28:14.920 --> 28:19.680
You're gonna be there with me,
front and centre, live and direct.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.280
That's what I'm talkin' about, bro.

28:23.320 --> 28:24.400
My guy!

28:24.480 --> 28:25.760
My guy!

28:25.840 --> 28:27.960
[Modie moans, laughs]

28:28.600 --> 28:29.960
My guy!

28:30.240 --> 28:32.000
[man 1] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:32.320 --> 28:33.640
[Modie yells] Nah! Nah!

28:34.720 --> 28:37.240
- [man 1] Yeah, yeah, yeah! Hoo!
- [man 2] King!

28:37.760 --> 28:39.400
[man 1] My man's been away and that.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.160
[man 2] Yo, but man's back, though!

28:42.640 --> 28:44.600
These are my Twistable crayons.

28:45.040 --> 28:46.160
That you can twist.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.960
- [Sully] Do you like drawing?
- Yeah.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.120
I find it fun.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.840
I used to draw.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.000
It's a cool room you got.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.000
'Best friend, love Emily.'

29:02.080 --> 29:04.040
- [Sully] Is Emily your best friend?
- Yeah.

29:05.360 --> 29:07.840
[Tasha] I think I drew that picture
when I was four.

29:08.760 --> 29:10.160
It's a long time ago.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.160
Four years is a long time.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.360
[Sully] That's a cool picture.

29:18.440 --> 29:20.080
Yeah, it's a holographic unicorn.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.600
Well, actually two unicorns.

29:23.320 --> 29:24.320
[Sully murmurs]

29:25.160 --> 29:26.560
Do you believe in unicorns?

29:29.120 --> 29:30.080
No.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.240
[Tasha sighs dramatically]

29:33.760 --> 29:35.680
- [chuckles]
- Do you believe in aliens?

29:36.640 --> 29:37.560
Yeah.

29:37.880 --> 29:39.840
Okay, at least that's something.

29:39.920 --> 29:41.080
[chuckles]

29:42.880 --> 29:44.440
[Tasha] And this is my favourite.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.560
The Tiger Who Came to Tea.

29:51.760 --> 29:52.760
What's that about?

29:53.560 --> 29:55.360
A tiger who came to tea.

29:57.760 --> 29:58.760
[Sully chuckles]

29:59.880 --> 30:01.000
Makes sense.

30:02.520 --> 30:04.560
[Sully] 'Suddenly, there was
a ring at the door.

30:05.080 --> 30:06.640
Sophie's mummy said...'

30:07.120 --> 30:08.720
[Tasha] 'I wonder who that can be.'

30:08.800 --> 30:11.520
'It can't be the milkman
because he came this morning.

30:12.920 --> 30:17.240
It can't be the boy from the grocer
because this isn't the day he comes.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.640
And it can't be Daddy

30:23.080 --> 30:24.760
because he's got keys.

30:31.360 --> 30:33.120
We'd better open the door and see.'

30:44.360 --> 30:45.720
'Sophie opened the door,

30:45.800 --> 30:49.560
and there was a big, furry stripey tiger.

30:50.880 --> 30:51.920
And the tiger said...'

30:52.000 --> 30:52.960
Aah!

30:53.160 --> 30:55.120
- You scared me.
- [laughs]

30:56.000 --> 30:57.120
'The tiger said...'

30:57.760 --> 31:00.560
'Excuse me, but I'm very hungry.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.440
Do you think I could have tea with you?'

31:02.520 --> 31:03.560
[chuckles]

31:03.640 --> 31:07.040
'Sophie's mummy said,
"Of course, come in."'

31:10.720 --> 31:11.680
[chuckles]

31:15.240 --> 31:16.680
[imitating Donovan] Mother.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.160
[pounding on door]

31:27.000 --> 31:29.080
- [Dushane] Who the fuck is that?
- I got this.

31:32.840 --> 31:33.720
[door opens]

31:35.440 --> 31:37.320
- [Dris] Wah gwaan.
- [Ricky] What's goin' on?

31:37.600 --> 31:38.560
[tsks]

31:39.960 --> 31:41.000
[door shuts]

31:41.240 --> 31:43.160
Fuckin' knockin' the door like that, man.

31:44.120 --> 31:45.480
[Dris sighs]

31:52.520 --> 31:54.800
You heard anything about the supplier
or what?

31:55.080 --> 31:56.200
Nah, nothin'.

31:59.560 --> 32:00.520
[door opens]

32:04.440 --> 32:05.280
It's me.

32:06.600 --> 32:07.600
[Dushane] Yo.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.400
Hey, you want some of this food?

32:11.560 --> 32:12.440
[Sully] Nah.

32:13.480 --> 32:14.480
[Dushane] Yo, wassup?

32:17.040 --> 32:18.480
The fuck's his problem?

32:20.000 --> 32:21.960
Look, fam, I gotta go.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.680
What do you mean, you gotta go?
Go fuckin' where?

32:25.680 --> 32:26.920
You sleepin' at home?

32:27.000 --> 32:29.280
I ain't got no choice. I got Erin, innit?

32:29.560 --> 32:31.920
Her mum got knocked back by parole again.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.960
Screamin' at the parole board and shit.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.400
Yeah, fuck all that.

32:36.440 --> 32:38.360
Just take care of your daughter, man.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.800
Anyway, I'm gonna bounce, man.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.280
Be careful.

32:48.680 --> 32:49.800
[door opens]

32:52.240 --> 32:53.160
[door shuts]

33:05.520 --> 33:07.000
[Lauryn chuckles] What am I lookin' at?

33:07.560 --> 33:11.600
One of my regulars,
her dad left her the place after he died.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.760
She's never been a landlord before.
She wants to rent it out mad quick.

33:16.280 --> 33:17.800
What? You wanna rent it?

33:18.400 --> 33:20.560
She's gonna give me a low price
on the rent.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.120
It's not cheap, but...

33:23.160 --> 33:24.120
it's doable.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.360
What? That is so exciting!
Are you serious?

33:27.440 --> 33:29.000
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

33:30.000 --> 33:32.120
So this is where I'm gonna get
my mani-pedis from now on, yeah?

33:32.200 --> 33:34.600
Well, no, 'cause you're gonna be
workin' here and all.

33:34.960 --> 33:37.560
Shelley, you know I love you and that,
but come on.

33:38.040 --> 33:41.080
Come on, there's no way you're gettin'
these hands near some other bitch's feet.

33:41.160 --> 33:42.480
Front of house, innit?

33:43.440 --> 33:45.640
- You mean reception?
- [laughs]

33:45.720 --> 33:48.560
I mean, you're gonna be
the face of the company.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.000
Okay, all right.

33:51.440 --> 33:54.720
What, so it's like, 'Welcome to Shelley's.
How can I help?'

33:54.800 --> 33:55.960
[both laugh]

33:56.040 --> 33:57.480
Yes. So what's the pay?

33:59.240 --> 34:01.200
- Wait...
- What?

34:01.280 --> 34:02.560
What? You're tryin' to get paid?

34:02.840 --> 34:03.760
Huh?

34:04.280 --> 34:06.880
- 'Course I'm gonna pay you.
- [Lauryn laughs]

34:06.960 --> 34:10.840
Seriously, though, we're gonna need
to redecorate this shit immediately.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.159
Get a bit of style,
a little bit of colour.

34:13.239 --> 34:16.040
Especially if I'm gonna be reppin' it,
d'you know what I'm sayin'?

34:16.120 --> 34:17.000
[laughs]

34:17.080 --> 34:19.800
- I'm so gushed for you!
- Totally gushed!

34:19.880 --> 34:20.719
It's gonna be sick!

34:20.800 --> 34:22.800
[melancholy ambient music playing]

34:51.679 --> 34:52.560
Yo.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.199
Yo, Sully.

34:57.160 --> 34:58.160
Fuckin' hell.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.240
[sighs]

35:00.320 --> 35:02.200
- What?
- What do we know about him?

35:03.600 --> 35:05.040
- Who?
- Jamie.

35:05.720 --> 35:08.120
He's got them two brothers, yeah?
But they're not on the road.

35:09.200 --> 35:12.040
Then he's got his number two,
that big fat fucker.

35:13.480 --> 35:14.960
Go on. What you thinkin'?

35:15.040 --> 35:18.840
What I'm sayin' is, who's the only
other person we've seen him with?

35:23.040 --> 35:25.000
[Lizzie] Next shipment should be
coming in soon.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.280
Who's this?

35:31.120 --> 35:32.040
[Jamie] Modie.

35:32.680 --> 35:34.720
He used to run the mandem
before he went into jail.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.400
He thinks I might have snaked on him.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.440
And did you?

35:46.320 --> 35:47.760
Is he gonna be a problem?

35:49.040 --> 35:50.000
Yeah.

35:50.680 --> 35:53.880
Well, if you got rid of him once,
you can do it again.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.640
Permanently would be preferable.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.480
Don't do it yourself.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.520
Top boy shouldn't be takin' those risks.

36:04.440 --> 36:06.600
What, is that the only reason
you don't want me to do it?

36:06.680 --> 36:10.040
No. Don't want to risk losing
my business partner, now do I?

36:19.080 --> 36:20.000
No.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.720
Nothing's changed.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.400
You need to stop playing games.

36:25.920 --> 36:29.160
- I know you like it with me.
- Look, we're not having this conversation.

36:29.640 --> 36:30.560
We'd be good together.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.720
Yeah, we've got a good thing
goin' on here, Jamie.

36:33.640 --> 36:34.720
Don't fuck it up.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.480
[door bell jingling]

36:53.120 --> 36:54.040
[door shuts]

36:55.840 --> 36:57.400
- Hello.
- Wah gwaan.

36:59.800 --> 37:00.640
What you sayin'?

37:04.480 --> 37:06.800
Heard they've got some
mad little trinkets in here, innit?

37:06.880 --> 37:07.840
[Jaq] Mm-hmm.

37:08.480 --> 37:09.440
[Dushane] You want this?

37:10.680 --> 37:12.680
[laughs] What the fuck is that?

37:12.760 --> 37:13.760
I don't fuckin' know.

37:13.840 --> 37:14.840
[Jaq laughs]

37:18.880 --> 37:20.960
Yes, that's a beautiful piece.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.440
A friend of mine picked it up in Morocco.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.680
[Lithe] Wards off the evil eye.

37:26.760 --> 37:27.920
[Jaq and Dushane snicker]

37:28.000 --> 37:29.040
Jokin'!

37:29.120 --> 37:31.600
- [Lithe] Is it for yourself?
- [Jaq] Nah, my girlfriend.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.080
She kinda likes this shit still.

37:33.160 --> 37:36.280
Well, you should bring her in.
We've got plenty more in that style.

37:36.680 --> 37:39.080
- [Dushane] Hmm? When are you open?
- Huh?

37:39.800 --> 37:40.800
To bring her in.

37:43.000 --> 37:43.840
Excuse me?

37:43.920 --> 37:46.960
Well, the sign on the door says
you're only open a couple of days a week.

37:47.040 --> 37:48.320
[Lithe] Yeah, that's right.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.520
You get enough business
for those hours, yeah?

37:52.600 --> 37:54.520
Well, things could always be
a little busier.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.800
Yeah, 'cause the rent round here
is fuckin' high, innit?

37:56.880 --> 37:58.080
- Mm-hmm.
- We're blessed with

37:58.160 --> 38:00.280
a very loyal customer base.

38:00.360 --> 38:01.440
[Jaq chuckles]

38:02.800 --> 38:04.800
Look, um, you're gonna have to excuse me

38:04.880 --> 38:06.840
'cause I was actually just
shutting up for the day.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.040
Why so early?

38:10.200 --> 38:14.440
Why don't you bring your girlfriend in,
and I'd be happy to show her...

38:14.520 --> 38:16.040
You know, you need to get some cameras.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.320
Uh, most businesses,
they have cameras in the shop,

38:19.720 --> 38:21.440
just in case there's any trouble.

38:23.480 --> 38:25.360
Yeah, we're thinking of getting one.

38:25.840 --> 38:27.120
She's thinking of gettin' one.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.080
[both chuckle]

38:30.360 --> 38:32.160
You know you ain't gettin' no cameras.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.960
You don't want anyone to know
what's goin' on in here, do ya?

38:38.920 --> 38:39.880
Where's that other woman?

38:40.760 --> 38:42.320
The blonde one, where is she?

38:49.680 --> 38:50.720
[hangs up phone]

38:50.800 --> 38:52.720
Nah. Fuck that.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.640
Where is she?

39:10.800 --> 39:12.800
[indistinct chatter in background]

39:19.920 --> 39:20.920
Yes.

39:21.480 --> 39:23.240
Come here, bruv. All right?

39:23.880 --> 39:24.840
[Jamie] Oh!

39:26.920 --> 39:28.120
[Jamie sighs]

39:28.680 --> 39:31.360
Well, this is weird, man.
It's like visitation hours or something.

39:31.440 --> 39:33.640
Bruv, shut up, man. What's wrong with you?

39:33.720 --> 39:35.120
- All right?
- Come on.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.840
- Ay.
- [Stefan] Hurry up, man. I'm hungry.

39:38.520 --> 39:42.200
I brought you to this place
'cause they make a bangin' pizza,

39:42.440 --> 39:45.040
bangin' pasta.
Look, they got lasagna and all of that.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.640
- You can have anything you want, innit?
- Yeah, I'm hungry still.

39:47.720 --> 39:49.960
- All right, gimme a glass of wine then.
- Yeah, go on.

39:50.040 --> 39:52.040
- Lemme get some wine, too.
- No.

39:52.120 --> 39:53.840
[tsks] Don't mind, don't mind.

39:54.200 --> 39:55.440
What you lot sayin', though?

39:55.520 --> 39:57.400
How's the house and that?
Keepin' it clean?

39:57.480 --> 39:58.360
[Aaron] Yeah, man.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.720
Mm. What about the kitchen?

40:00.800 --> 40:03.680
I thought we came here for pizza, fam.
Why are you talkin' about cleanin'?

40:03.760 --> 40:06.320
Can we order now? I'm hungry.
I know what I'm gonna order.

40:06.480 --> 40:07.720
Let me get the...

40:09.320 --> 40:10.360
taligalata...

40:10.440 --> 40:11.920
- [Jamie chuckles]
- Li fileto.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.200
- Oh, this guy, man.
- A li ga puglia.

40:14.280 --> 40:17.240
Hey, what you talkin' about?
What you... What you talkin' about?

40:17.320 --> 40:18.960
Oh, my God.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.480
We can't order yet, anyway.
We're waitin' for someone.

40:21.560 --> 40:23.120
- Who?
- A girl.

40:23.800 --> 40:27.240
A girl? For real?
So what? You got a girlfriend now, yeah?

40:27.320 --> 40:29.000
- You'll see.
- [Aaron] All right.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.120
Yo, Stef, how's school?

40:31.200 --> 40:32.880
Yeah, it's calm still. [tsks]

40:32.960 --> 40:34.920
I decided I'm gonna study anthropology.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.800
Yeah? Come on.

40:36.880 --> 40:38.840
- Bro, do you even know what that is?
- Yeah, I do.

40:38.920 --> 40:41.160
- What is it then?
- It's deep. That's all you need to know.

40:41.240 --> 40:42.600
- You don't know what it is.
- Very deep.

40:42.680 --> 40:45.480
- You don't even understand what it is.
- Shut up, man.

40:45.560 --> 40:47.880
Don't worry, man,
you can study that at uni.

40:49.480 --> 40:50.880
There's that girl now.

40:52.600 --> 40:53.920
Hey, when'd you invite her?

40:54.000 --> 40:56.600
Well, it's about time I met that girl
that's been turnin' your head.

40:56.680 --> 40:58.960
- Ay, fam...
- Since she's always stayin' over and that.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.040
- Told you he knew.
- Yeah.

41:00.120 --> 41:01.960
You got clocked, you wasteman!

41:02.040 --> 41:04.120
- Snitched, innit?
- What, you thought I didn't know?

41:04.200 --> 41:06.120
I've got eyes everywhere, bro.

41:06.200 --> 41:07.480
You should know that.

41:07.680 --> 41:09.960
- [Aaron] You're a little snitch, man.
- [chuckles]

41:10.960 --> 41:13.400
- You all right, yeah?
- Hi, Jamie. Hi, Stef.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.560
Give her a kiss then, big man.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.240
Hey, relax, man. Whatcha tryin' to do?

41:17.320 --> 41:19.560
Go and give her a kiss.
That's why she's your girlfriend.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.840
You're not gonna give me a kiss
in front of your brothers?

41:21.920 --> 41:23.240
Such a drag, man.

41:23.720 --> 41:24.960
- [Jamie] Ooh!
- [Stefan retches]

41:25.040 --> 41:27.280
[Aaron] Relax, man. I'm feelin' violated.

41:28.120 --> 41:30.120
[suspenseful music playing]

41:48.920 --> 41:50.120
[Dushane] We're sweet, brudder.

42:12.400 --> 42:13.800
[lock clangs on floor]

42:19.960 --> 42:20.920
Hello again.

42:22.600 --> 42:25.040
What are you doin'? Put that down.
Drop the fuckin' knife!

42:26.160 --> 42:27.000
[Dushane chuckles]

42:27.280 --> 42:28.920
Don't do anything stupid, you know?

42:29.120 --> 42:31.320
'Cause my friend will shoot you
in your face. Understand?

42:31.400 --> 42:34.280
- Yeah. Yeah.
- [Dushane] Anyone else in the house?

42:34.360 --> 42:37.080
- [shivering] No.
- Are you expecting anyone?

42:37.440 --> 42:38.520
No, my...

42:40.160 --> 42:41.800
My husband's away on business.

42:42.320 --> 42:43.320
Yeah, fuck all that.

42:44.000 --> 42:44.840
Sit down.

43:03.640 --> 43:07.120
So, we haven't been properly introduced.

43:09.320 --> 43:10.320
Your name's Lizzie.

43:11.920 --> 43:12.880
Yeah.

43:16.480 --> 43:17.640
How do you know Jamie?

43:18.880 --> 43:20.120
[exhales nervously]

43:20.200 --> 43:21.160
We, uh...

43:22.960 --> 43:23.880
Oh, God.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.160
Please don't tell my husband.

43:31.280 --> 43:33.040
Please. [sobbing]

43:36.000 --> 43:37.400
[Lizzie sniffles] We've...

43:37.960 --> 43:38.920
We've been...

43:39.320 --> 43:40.560
seeing each other.

43:43.320 --> 43:44.560
We met in a bar...

43:46.040 --> 43:47.160
a few weeks ago.

43:47.240 --> 43:49.240
Christ, I'm so fuckin' stupid, I'm sorry.

43:50.840 --> 43:55.000
Please don't tell my husband, please.
It'll break his heart, please.

43:55.120 --> 43:57.360
[Dushane laughs]

43:58.440 --> 44:00.280
You... Are you fuckin' serious?

44:01.560 --> 44:03.360
- [Dushane] Bruv!
- Fuckin' real dribble as well.

44:03.440 --> 44:05.800
[Dushane] What the fuck is goin' on?
What's this?

44:06.280 --> 44:07.200
[Lizzie] What...

44:07.280 --> 44:08.760
[Dushane] Are you seein' this shit?

44:08.840 --> 44:09.920
Fuckin' hell.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.680
- You're good, you know.
- What do you want from me?

44:12.760 --> 44:14.560
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
Don't waste your time.

44:15.680 --> 44:17.920
We talked to your friend, Lithe.

44:19.040 --> 44:19.920
[Dushane chuckles]

44:20.200 --> 44:21.280
[murmurs]

44:21.360 --> 44:23.280
And her story is very different to yours.

44:24.080 --> 44:26.800
Apparently, Jamie has been gettin'
a lot more than pussy.

44:28.280 --> 44:30.960
Dark, white, weed, spice.

44:32.600 --> 44:33.520
All of that.

44:35.080 --> 44:37.400
Don't worry about your friend, though,
she's all right.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.760
One of our people are with her now.

44:41.280 --> 44:43.320
So as long as you do what the fuck we say,

44:44.920 --> 44:45.880
she'll be cool.

44:46.960 --> 44:47.960
What do you need?

44:49.440 --> 44:51.520
Your fuckin' prick boyfriend off the road.

44:54.040 --> 44:56.360
- [exhales]
- And you're gonna help us do it.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.120
Do you get me?

45:01.520 --> 45:02.360
Yeah.

45:02.920 --> 45:03.880
Good.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.320
What happens to me?

45:09.120 --> 45:09.960
After?

45:12.080 --> 45:13.240
[sighs]

45:16.440 --> 45:17.320
[tsks]

45:19.800 --> 45:22.240
I can help you with a lot more than Jamie.

45:23.640 --> 45:25.440
You're a businessman, right?

45:25.520 --> 45:28.040
I can supply you with
all the drugs you need.

45:29.960 --> 45:33.560
- Regular shipments, highest grade...
- Oh, mate, whatever.

45:33.640 --> 45:36.440
- Why the fuck would you do that?
- When you take Jamie out of the picture,

45:36.520 --> 45:38.240
you're leavin' me without
a business partner.

45:39.400 --> 45:41.640
[Lizzie] Everything I've been
supplying to Jamie.

45:42.560 --> 45:45.600
White, dark, anything you want.

45:47.560 --> 45:50.760
All of my stock can go exclusively to you.

45:50.840 --> 45:52.120
We have our own supplier.

45:52.880 --> 45:54.360
- Yeah?
- [Dushane] Yes.

45:56.560 --> 45:57.760
Are they reliable?

45:59.960 --> 46:00.920
Trustworthy?

46:07.920 --> 46:09.640
[Stefan groans] I'm bendy, man.

46:09.720 --> 46:11.760
Bruv, what d'you expect
when you had a whole pizza

46:11.840 --> 46:13.960
and a whole lasagna to yourself?

46:14.040 --> 46:15.840
You're gonna be fat, you know.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.680
This guy's gonna be wide, watch.

46:17.760 --> 46:19.080
[Abby] Do you want dessert, Stef?

46:19.160 --> 46:20.240
That's not funny, man.

46:20.320 --> 46:21.320
[laughs]

46:21.400 --> 46:22.520
[Jamie] Oh, man.

46:23.120 --> 46:24.240
[Abby] Was that you?

46:24.440 --> 46:26.360
How you let that off? That was you, innit?

46:26.680 --> 46:30.600
- [Abby] Oh, Stef!
- That's it, man. It's called natural gas.

46:30.680 --> 46:32.800
- What do you mean, natural gas, bruv?
- Natural gas.

46:32.880 --> 46:35.240
Make sure you go to the toilet
before you go to bed, you know.

46:35.320 --> 46:37.320
- [Abby] It does smell like you though.
- [Aaron] It's not me.

46:37.400 --> 46:39.240
We're in a big restaurant,
you think I'm gonna let it off?

46:39.320 --> 46:42.680
Hey, Abby. If my brother's ever unfaithful
to you, yeah, just know...

46:42.760 --> 46:44.080
Relax yourself, he did it.

46:44.160 --> 46:46.520
...just know,
I will personally fuck him up.

46:46.600 --> 46:49.080
Thanks, Jamie. But if your brother's
ever unfaithful to me,

46:49.160 --> 46:51.680
I'm perfectly capable
of fuckin' him up myself.

46:52.120 --> 46:54.600
Whoa. Hey, relax, man.
Why does everyone wanna fuck me up now?

46:54.680 --> 46:55.680
- Like...
- We're jokin'!

46:55.760 --> 46:57.960
I'm a faithful guy.
Like, no one needs to fuck me up.

46:58.040 --> 46:59.160
What's this about?

47:00.520 --> 47:01.800
How faithful are you, though?

47:01.880 --> 47:02.920
You all right?

47:05.080 --> 47:06.400
What's wrong, man? Talk to me.

47:07.840 --> 47:09.080
When will you be home?

47:11.240 --> 47:12.480
Couple more days.

47:15.600 --> 47:16.760
Will you get arrested?

47:17.760 --> 47:19.480
What do you mean, get arrested, man?

47:19.560 --> 47:20.760
Who's gonna arrest me?

47:20.840 --> 47:21.800
The feds.

47:23.840 --> 47:26.640
Listen, bro.
Don't worry about all of that, man.

47:26.720 --> 47:28.480
Ain't nobody gettin' arrested round here.

47:28.560 --> 47:30.440
Couple more days, I'm gonna be home,

47:30.800 --> 47:32.640
everything's gonna be back to normal.

47:33.120 --> 47:34.240
I promise.

47:38.920 --> 47:40.640
Yo, allow it, you man. It's calm.

47:40.840 --> 47:41.680
It's calm.

47:43.640 --> 47:45.640
What are you doin' here, Jermaine, man?
What's good?

47:45.720 --> 47:46.760
Jamie.

47:48.120 --> 47:49.560
You seem bigger now.

47:51.200 --> 47:53.040
I see you're havin' dinner
with your family.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.600
- That's nice.
- What's all this small talk?

47:55.680 --> 47:57.000
- Let me finish.
- Cut to the chase.

48:00.080 --> 48:01.880
I'm sure you've seen or heard, yeah?

48:03.560 --> 48:04.560
He wants to see you.

48:05.080 --> 48:07.520
Well, as you just said,
I'm here with my family.

48:07.600 --> 48:10.040
So tell him, he can tell me
wherever, whenever...

48:10.120 --> 48:12.440
Listen, enough with the talkin', bro,
yeah?

48:12.520 --> 48:14.240
He wants to see you now.
The car's outside.

48:14.840 --> 48:15.880
[Jermaine clears throat]

48:22.720 --> 48:26.120
Don't disrespect the respect
I'm showin' you right now, bro.

48:27.000 --> 48:27.920
Yeah?

48:28.200 --> 48:29.840
This could've been madness.

48:39.360 --> 48:41.280
[tsks] Say nothin', man.

48:41.560 --> 48:44.000
- Yo, Jamie, what's going on?
- [Jamie] Chill out, man, it's calm.

48:44.320 --> 48:46.560
You lot just go home.
I'mma call you in the mornin'.

48:46.960 --> 48:48.160
- Where you goin'?
- [Jamie] Yeah?

48:48.240 --> 48:49.720
Just gonna handle some business.

48:50.320 --> 48:51.320
Trust me, it's fine.

48:51.400 --> 48:52.720
I'll call you in the mornin'.

48:54.000 --> 48:54.840
Bless.

49:04.440 --> 49:05.480
[door shuts]

49:16.240 --> 49:17.160
[car door shuts]

49:18.920 --> 49:20.760
[car engine starts, revs]

49:31.640 --> 49:32.720
[chuckles]

49:43.200 --> 49:44.360
[Modie] Long time, bro.

49:47.680 --> 49:48.560
[sniffles]

49:49.680 --> 49:52.400
People are tellin' me that
you're runnin' the mandem now.

49:55.640 --> 49:58.000
Well, it ain't up to me
what people have been sayin'.

49:59.880 --> 50:00.760
Hm.

50:04.560 --> 50:05.400
Aight.

50:06.440 --> 50:08.480
Well, let me rephrase that then.

50:10.400 --> 50:11.640
What are you sayin'?

50:13.400 --> 50:14.320
Hm?

50:16.840 --> 50:17.680
Fam...

50:19.000 --> 50:22.080
all I did, yeah,
was step up while you was away.

50:35.360 --> 50:36.400
[Modie] He stepped up.

50:37.760 --> 50:39.600
[Modie chuckles] He stepped up.

50:39.680 --> 50:40.800
[Modie sniffles]

50:43.840 --> 50:45.040
What about Leyton?

50:47.280 --> 50:48.200
[Modie] Huh?

50:52.280 --> 50:54.200
Summerhouse got Leyton, fam.

51:02.960 --> 51:04.080
Is that so?

51:13.400 --> 51:14.560
[Modie sighs]

51:15.240 --> 51:16.320
Jamie.

51:20.800 --> 51:22.080
[Modie snickers]

51:31.000 --> 51:32.920
- Jamie.
- Bro, just listen.

51:33.840 --> 51:34.760
Man...

51:35.440 --> 51:38.760
You went away, and then I stepped up.

51:39.080 --> 51:41.840
Now the mandem have levelled up.

51:42.720 --> 51:44.320
And you know what that means.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.640
It means we're makin' a lot more Ps,

51:46.720 --> 51:49.240
a lot more Ps
that you're gonna need, my bro.

51:49.840 --> 51:52.160
Think about it. A man on the run.

51:53.120 --> 51:54.720
People gonna be chargin' you, like, what,

51:54.800 --> 51:59.040
two, three, four, ten times
what they're chargin' everyone else.

51:59.640 --> 52:03.040
Bro, I can give you anything you need
for you to escape.

52:04.240 --> 52:05.280
I got you.

52:06.480 --> 52:07.480
Escape?

52:09.800 --> 52:11.120
[chuckles]

52:13.280 --> 52:15.320
Did I ever say anything about an escape?

52:21.800 --> 52:23.080
I ain't goin' nowhere.

52:27.800 --> 52:31.920
But... I am gonna need
some of the Ps you've been makin'.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.040
In fact, fuck that.

52:33.120 --> 52:35.360
I'm gonna need all of the Ps
you've been makin'.

52:35.440 --> 52:37.000
[Jamie murmurs uncomfortably]

52:37.080 --> 52:38.520
And my guy Jermaine over here,

52:38.600 --> 52:40.560
he's gonna need some of the Ps
you're makin' too.

52:40.640 --> 52:43.280
Bro, you're not safe here.

52:44.520 --> 52:46.760
What you're doin' ain't makin' no sense.

52:46.840 --> 52:49.320
The feds are going to be on you like mad...

52:49.400 --> 52:52.600
I don't give a fuck who's comin' for me!

52:54.120 --> 52:57.840
The feds, Trident, Navy SEALs,
the fuckin' army.

52:57.920 --> 53:01.520
I don't care! These are my ends! Mine!

53:02.320 --> 53:03.280
Yeah?

53:04.960 --> 53:07.320
And I'm stayin' exactly where I am.

53:10.480 --> 53:11.720
I'm back, Jamie.

53:13.480 --> 53:16.600
And I'm back for good.

53:16.840 --> 53:18.880
[mobile phone ringing]

53:22.360 --> 53:23.200
Hello?

53:23.520 --> 53:24.720
[Dushane] Hey, Sheanay, listen.

53:25.240 --> 53:27.800
Sorry I ain't called before now, you know,
I just ain't had time.

53:28.520 --> 53:29.560
Things are mad.

53:30.240 --> 53:31.200
How are you?

53:31.280 --> 53:33.280
Yeah, I'm all right.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
I ain't stopped thinkin' about Donovan.

53:38.440 --> 53:39.480
You get me?

53:41.840 --> 53:43.240
He had good dreams, man.

53:49.280 --> 53:50.520
Sheanay, listen.

53:51.720 --> 53:53.240
There's something I want to do for him.

53:54.920 --> 53:56.920
[ominous music playing]
