WEBVTT

01:03.792 --> 01:06.542
Okay, the free time
is mind-boggling.

01:06.542 --> 01:08.708
I have class once a week,
and then the rest of the week

01:08.708 --> 01:10.458
is just mine
to do whatever I want with,

01:10.458 --> 01:12.875
so it's like
I'm doing kind of like
home economics stuff.

01:12.875 --> 01:16.542
I made these brownies myself
from scratch using just a mix.

01:16.542 --> 01:18.291
And they're good.

01:18.291 --> 01:20.208
Did you find me
my Amish bonnet yet?

01:20.208 --> 01:22.792
No, people here
are technically Mennonites,
they're not Amish,

01:22.792 --> 01:25.708
so it's actually
pretty offensive
to switch the terms.

01:25.708 --> 01:27.667
I'm off to Java House
to meet Trad for an espresso.

01:27.667 --> 01:29.083
Mm-kay, then you'll
come back to watch

01:29.083 --> 01:31.041
the "Torkelsons" marathon
with me on TeenNick?

01:31.041 --> 01:33.333
Oh, that sounds so fun,
but, you know what?

01:33.333 --> 01:35.166
I've gotta pop
across the river
and help DeDe

01:35.166 --> 01:37.250
put the finishing touches
on her chapbook.

01:37.250 --> 01:39.000
And then I've gotta
go check on Rafe.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.250
But we're gonna go
to that poet party
tonight, right?

01:41.250 --> 01:43.166
I mean, what other choice
do I have in this fuckin'
one-horse town?

01:43.166 --> 01:44.750
There's literally
nothing to do.

01:44.750 --> 01:47.500
- Elijah: Bye. ( kisses )
- Hannah: Bye, lovey.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.542
Oh.
Hi, Jessa.

01:49.542 --> 01:50.959
Oh, hey.

01:50.959 --> 01:53.500
I see you haven't backed off
on the self-tanner.

01:53.500 --> 01:57.667
Still see you're wearing
that same sad kimono.

01:57.667 --> 01:58.834
Bye.

01:58.834 --> 02:01.333
Um, so, have you been
writing a lot lately?

02:01.333 --> 02:04.125
- ( door closes )
- Yeah, I mean... yeah.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.000
Right now I'm in a more
pre-writing phase,

02:06.000 --> 02:10.375
but it's all...
happening or will happen.

02:12.125 --> 02:15.083
Um, what have
you heard from Adam?

02:15.083 --> 02:16.208
Have you talked to him?

02:16.208 --> 02:19.375
No, not really.
Briefly this morning.

02:19.375 --> 02:22.208
But before that,
maybe once or twice
yesterday

02:22.208 --> 02:23.834
and then otherwise
just at AA

02:23.834 --> 02:26.375
every single fucking day
for the rest of my life.

02:26.375 --> 02:28.959
Okay, well, that's sort of
a lot of time.

02:28.959 --> 02:31.542
Does he ever mention me?

02:31.542 --> 02:34.750
Um, no.

02:34.750 --> 02:37.250
( music playing
in background )

02:37.250 --> 02:38.500
Well, that's good
'cause actually,

02:38.500 --> 02:40.583
I hadn't thought of him
till just now.

02:40.583 --> 02:42.291
You said something else
that started with the letter A

02:42.291 --> 02:44.708
and it made me
think of Adam and
how he was doing.

02:44.708 --> 02:45.875
( music continues )

02:45.875 --> 02:49.000
Also made me think
of apples.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.208
Jessa!

02:53.000 --> 02:54.625
Oh, for crying
sweet Jesus.

02:54.625 --> 02:58.166
Nice, nice.

02:58.166 --> 03:00.333
I mean, it actually
does look nice.

03:00.333 --> 03:05.417
♪ 'Cause our love
keeps our bodies... ♪

03:05.417 --> 03:08.291
No, but see, it's not
just about sex.

03:08.291 --> 03:11.333
We text good night.
I met his cousin.

03:11.333 --> 03:12.917
He, like, puts
his hand on my butt

03:12.917 --> 03:14.458
when we're waiting
in line at Starbucks.

03:14.458 --> 03:16.333
He makes me look at him
when he comes.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.500
Okay, bottom line, as long
as he's with Clementine,

03:18.500 --> 03:19.917
you are not his priority.

03:19.917 --> 03:23.083
And you are definitely--
definitely not in any kind
of relationship.

03:23.083 --> 03:25.750
But I'm not the mistress.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.542
You are 1,000%
the mistress.

03:27.542 --> 03:29.792
Not if I end up
with him, I'm not.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.959
Fuck, I could've sold this
to Yusef last weekend.

03:31.959 --> 03:35.000
His situation with Clementine
is really fucking complicated.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.458
She's got, like,
this autoimmune illness

03:37.458 --> 03:39.458
where she gets
fevers and rashes.

03:39.458 --> 03:42.583
I mean, it's weird.
He has to be very careful
not to upset her.

03:42.583 --> 03:44.333
It could, like,
endanger her health.

03:44.333 --> 03:45.875
- "Fevers and rashes"?
- Yes.

03:45.875 --> 03:47.291
- Bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

03:47.291 --> 03:48.625
- Bullshit!
- He's really worked up
about this.

03:48.625 --> 03:52.291
- It's hard for him.
- This guy has it made
in the shade.

03:52.291 --> 03:53.792
He's got a bungalow
on Easy Street

03:53.792 --> 03:55.667
where he has his cake
and he eats it, too.

03:55.667 --> 03:58.625
Do you understand?
The man's a Svengali, okay?

03:58.625 --> 04:00.834
He's a Casanova
who counts cards secretly

04:00.834 --> 04:02.458
while he's got
four queens up the sleeve.

04:02.458 --> 04:04.667
He is not to be trusted.

04:06.625 --> 04:09.041
I don't know.

04:09.041 --> 04:12.291
Do you think maybe
this is just, like,
cosmic retribution

04:12.291 --> 04:15.375
for what we did
to Shoshanna?

04:15.375 --> 04:19.291
Putting aside my disdain
for the injection of witchcraft

04:19.291 --> 04:22.500
into a conversation
that was previously tethered
by logic and reason,

04:22.500 --> 04:23.834
no, I don't think
that's what's happening here.

04:23.834 --> 04:27.667
Yeah, you're right.
I'm way more upset
than she ever was.

04:29.208 --> 04:31.166
( sighs )

04:31.166 --> 04:36.208
Look, even if this knot
were to somehow untangle itself,

04:36.208 --> 04:38.083
even if he were
to jettison her,

04:38.083 --> 04:41.291
make a host of sweeping
promises to you,

04:41.291 --> 04:42.542
hop on a white horse,

04:42.542 --> 04:44.041
gallop to your place
with a truckload of roses--

04:44.041 --> 04:45.542
- even if he did all that...
- Mm-hmm.

04:45.542 --> 04:47.000
I still don't think
you should be with this guy.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.458
Is it 'cause he called you
a hepcat that one time?

04:50.458 --> 04:52.583
Because anyone who would
treat you this way

04:52.583 --> 04:54.125
is selfish and a coward.

04:54.125 --> 04:57.375
And we've already established
he has one massive
character flaw,

04:57.375 --> 05:00.208
which is that
he hasn't chosen you.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.542
- Is this okay?
- Yeah.

05:10.542 --> 05:11.750
Okay.

05:11.750 --> 05:13.375
Woman:
And, finally,
if all goes well,

05:13.375 --> 05:15.708
your responsibilities
might include

05:15.708 --> 05:18.750
allocating trend jewelry,

05:18.750 --> 05:21.875
and helping us implement
our cardigan story for spring.

05:21.875 --> 05:24.583
Oh, my God,
I love cardigans,
first of all.

05:24.583 --> 05:27.166
Um, also,
I really don't
want to boast,

05:27.166 --> 05:29.708
but I'm a little bit
of an expert when it
comes to trend jewelry.

05:29.708 --> 05:31.041
And maybe, like,
trends in general.

05:31.041 --> 05:33.125
Perfect, perfect.
Just perfect.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.583
Well, now that I've done
my little dog and pony show,

05:35.583 --> 05:36.917
do you have
any questions for me?

05:36.917 --> 05:40.208
Um, not really.
This interview was
super informative.

05:40.208 --> 05:43.750
And fun, right?
Am I crazy to say that?

05:43.750 --> 05:45.417
No, it was totally fun.
It was so fun.

05:45.417 --> 05:47.166
I feel like we were, like,
totally just grabbing drinks

05:47.166 --> 05:48.834
- Totally.
- ...like we were
best friends

05:48.834 --> 05:51.083
- and we were
talking about boys.
- Oh, my God, I love it.

05:51.083 --> 05:53.625
Listen, Shoshanna,
I can't officially
offer you the job

05:53.625 --> 05:54.917
until meet
the other candidates,

05:54.917 --> 05:56.708
but if you want it--
totally yours.

05:56.708 --> 05:59.417
Okay, that is literally
the exact feedback...

05:59.417 --> 06:01.083
- Yay!
- ...that I was hoping for.

06:01.083 --> 06:03.917
So I guess it's safe to say
I'll be seeing you really soon.

06:03.917 --> 06:07.458
Um, actually,
I don't know
if you will.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.625
Wh-- um,
I'm sorry, what?

06:10.625 --> 06:13.083
Well, I mean,
if I can be totally honest,

06:13.083 --> 06:14.834
which I feel like
I really can be with you...

06:14.834 --> 06:17.208
- Yeah.
- Um, I think
in my heart of hearts,

06:17.208 --> 06:19.750
I knew that, like, this was
really just a trial interview.

06:19.750 --> 06:22.125
You know,
to hone my skills,

06:22.125 --> 06:24.125
test, like, the firmness
of my handshake

06:24.125 --> 06:25.250
and the walkability
of these heels.

06:25.250 --> 06:26.750
Why would you come in here
and waste my time

06:26.750 --> 06:28.417
if you don't want to work
at Anne Taylor Loft?

06:28.417 --> 06:30.792
I just needed a run-through
before I went on an interview

06:30.792 --> 06:34.458
for a job that I was, like,
deeply passionate about,
you know?

06:34.458 --> 06:38.792
Okay, great.
Well, thank you
for your candor, I guess.

06:38.792 --> 06:40.500
Yeah, no, you should
know that about me.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.208
I think it's really
important to be honest,

06:42.208 --> 06:43.875
like, even when it's
a little bit difficult.

06:43.875 --> 06:46.917
Super important, yeah.
Here you go.

06:46.917 --> 06:50.291
Oh, no,
you can keep that.

07:20.458 --> 07:23.417
Uh, seriously?
Goosebumps.

07:23.417 --> 07:25.417
- Goosies. Feel it.
- He gets 'em big time.

07:25.417 --> 07:27.333
- ( laughing )
- Thank you.

07:27.333 --> 07:29.500
I think we definitely
have to get Marcos
in here.

07:29.500 --> 07:30.875
Fuck.
When's he back?

07:30.875 --> 07:33.208
Not soon enough.
Damn it.

07:33.208 --> 07:35.417
When can we get you guys
back in to meet Marcos?

07:35.417 --> 07:38.708
- I start shooting a movie
in a couple months...
- Really, any time.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.125
but before then, any--
yeah, any time.

07:40.125 --> 07:42.041
- Yeah. Who is Marcos?
- Woman: He's my boss.

07:42.041 --> 07:44.000
He's the one who can
really get the ball rolling.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.750
There's a ball
to get rolling?

07:45.750 --> 07:48.208
Oh, yeah.
A big ball.

07:48.208 --> 07:50.041
Wow.

07:50.041 --> 07:52.500
Okay, so tell me
before I pop off,
what's your story?

07:52.500 --> 07:54.208
- Yeah, we're just...
- Primarily acoustic.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.917
Yeah,
two singer-songwriters.

07:55.917 --> 07:57.291
We've recorded two demos.

07:57.291 --> 08:00.041
- How'd you meet?
- How long have you two
been together?

08:00.041 --> 08:02.667
- What's the sex like?
- Oh, my God!

08:02.667 --> 08:05.583
I'm just kidding.
Unless they're
gonna tell us.

08:05.583 --> 08:07.208
Woman #2:
I'm sorry.

08:07.208 --> 08:08.875
Uh, we're--
we're not together.

08:08.875 --> 08:10.959
Woman #2:
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

08:10.959 --> 08:13.959
- No, no, it's fine.
- No, don't feel bad.
That's a common mistake.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.250
Yeah, it happens a lot.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.583
I actually have a girlfriend.
Clementine Barrios is her name.

08:17.583 --> 08:19.375
She's a consultant.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.208
Bummer.

08:22.208 --> 08:25.375
I'm just kidding.
I'm-- I mean, that's great.

08:25.375 --> 08:27.417
She sounds great.

08:27.417 --> 08:28.583
Can I have
one of those...

08:28.583 --> 08:31.250
- Oh, a cigarette?
- Marnie: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.833
I would just love one
right about now

08:32.833 --> 08:34.667
- for some reason.
- Marnie, you can't
smoke in here.

08:34.667 --> 08:37.500
Well, we can go outside
and smoke out there.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.457
Marnie.

08:39.457 --> 08:40.750
What?

08:44.500 --> 08:46.250
We'll smoke after.

08:48.792 --> 08:50.542
We had agreed
on this once-a-month rule

08:50.542 --> 08:53.583
that was supposed
to help with boundaries
or some fuckin' shit.

08:53.583 --> 08:55.583
Yeah. I think
that's good, though.

08:55.583 --> 08:58.750
I mean, I hate talking
to people who aren't
within 50 feet of me.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.083
Yeah, but every time
I got her on the phone,

09:00.083 --> 09:02.875
- all she wanted to do
was talk about stupid shit.
- Right.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.542
Like they sell donuts
at the movie theater...

09:04.542 --> 09:06.333
- ( groans )
- ...or whatever.
Nothing real.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.208
I mean, she couldn't
have been getting anything
out of that.

09:08.208 --> 09:11.166
- Mm-hmm.
- I thought talking less
would keep us

09:11.166 --> 09:13.875
from having those
stupid conversations
about fuckin' zero.

09:13.875 --> 09:15.208
Guess who.

09:15.208 --> 09:17.917
- Hi.
- Hey, you wanna
go get a smoke?

09:17.917 --> 09:19.291
- No.
- Why not?

09:19.291 --> 09:20.792
I'm-- 'cause I'm
working right now.

09:20.792 --> 09:22.959
I'm involved.
I'm giving back.

09:22.959 --> 09:24.708
Can you just
take a break?

09:24.708 --> 09:27.417
No, no,
but if you want one,
you can have one.

09:27.417 --> 09:28.750
- Just take it.
- That'd be great.

09:28.750 --> 09:31.291
- You'll meet me
out there soon?
- Mm-hmm.

09:31.291 --> 09:33.458
- See you soon.
- Bye, bye.

09:34.750 --> 09:36.625
Man, you could've got
your dick sucked.

09:36.625 --> 09:38.917
( both laugh )

09:38.917 --> 09:41.834
I let that kid make out
with me the other night

09:41.834 --> 09:44.458
and he just, like, came
in his pants instantly.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.417
- Aw.
- Can you believe that?

09:46.417 --> 09:47.708
Were you pissed?

09:47.708 --> 09:50.291
No. I mean, I get it.
It was flattering.

09:50.291 --> 09:52.041
He's having trouble
with the whole God thing,

09:52.041 --> 09:55.500
so I told him just replace
the word "God" for "Jessa"
and, like, see if it helps.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.834
And now I'm, like,
the only thing

09:57.834 --> 10:00.333
standing between him
and a crack pipe.

10:00.333 --> 10:06.041
You think it's fine
if I throw out all of Hannah's
refrigerator magnets?

10:06.041 --> 10:10.333
Ugh, this whole thing
is why I hate relationships
between white people.

10:12.542 --> 10:14.083
- Well, you don't even smoke.
- You don't--

10:14.083 --> 10:15.875
I smoke every
once in a while.

10:15.875 --> 10:18.125
- When?
- I do every
once in a while.

10:18.125 --> 10:20.000
And then you started
acting-- I don't even
know what that was.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.291
- You derailed
the whole meeting.
- Don't be a drama queen.

10:22.291 --> 10:23.959
That's unprofessional.
No, that's unprofessional.

10:23.959 --> 10:25.875
Come on, they liked us.
We're going back to meet
with Marcos.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.083
- I know.
- Chill the fuck out.

10:27.083 --> 10:28.417
All right, it was
fuckin' strange, man.

10:28.417 --> 10:30.875
- It was weird.
- Don't call me "man."

10:30.875 --> 10:33.500
- Oh, my God.
- What?

10:33.500 --> 10:35.708
Bella, what is
going on with you?

10:35.708 --> 10:38.875
- Can you talk to me?
- I'm talking to you
right now.

10:38.875 --> 10:41.583
Because you are, like,
coming from a place that I--

10:41.583 --> 10:43.125
I don't even recognize
this person.

10:43.125 --> 10:46.041
Come here.
Come here.

10:46.041 --> 10:47.417
All right,
you know what?

10:47.417 --> 10:49.583
- You wanna know
what's wrong?
- Yeah.

10:49.583 --> 10:52.000
I'll tell you
what's wrong.
Sit down.

10:55.375 --> 11:00.250
Okay, just so you know,
what happened in there
was fucking awesome.

11:00.250 --> 11:02.708
- I'm so psyched about it.
- Yeah, me, too.

11:02.708 --> 11:06.333
What else is happening
in our relationship together,

11:06.333 --> 11:07.792
I can't do it anymore.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.458
You're talking
about the intimacy.

11:09.458 --> 11:11.083
Yes, I'm talking
about the intimacy.

11:11.083 --> 11:14.250
I can't do it anymore, Desi.
It's not working for me.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.250
I'm not supposed
to be someone's mistress.

11:16.250 --> 11:19.000
Nobody thinks of you
as a mistress, Marn.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.708
But because nobody
thinks about me at all,

11:20.708 --> 11:22.625
like, in relation to you.

11:22.625 --> 11:23.750
I do.

11:25.083 --> 11:27.417
That's not all
that matters to me.

11:27.417 --> 11:29.250
We're building
a future together,

11:29.250 --> 11:32.542
- a musical future
together.
- Yeah.

11:32.542 --> 11:36.750
So why the fuck
do you still have
a girlfriend who isn't me?

11:38.542 --> 11:41.500
Well, I never said that
I would end anything
with Clementine.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.417
Yeah, but, see,
it's normal for someone

11:43.417 --> 11:45.250
to not want the person
that they're sleeping with

11:45.250 --> 11:46.708
to be sleeping
with somebody else.

11:46.708 --> 11:49.792
Yeah, I think that's a very
culturally-specific statement.

11:49.792 --> 11:53.166
But I also think that
I've been very clear with you
from the beginning, Marn.

11:53.166 --> 11:55.166
Yes, you have,
but that doesn't
make it okay.

11:55.166 --> 11:57.041
That doesn't
make it feel okay.

11:57.041 --> 11:59.583
You are very young.
You are very smart.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.625
- You are very beautiful.
- Thank you.

12:01.625 --> 12:05.041
And you're living
in this amazing city, okay?

12:05.041 --> 12:07.917
And if we're gonna have
this incredible, explosive,

12:07.917 --> 12:12.125
sexually collaborative,
musical, love relationship,

12:12.125 --> 12:14.458
which I can totally see,
to be honest with you,

12:14.458 --> 12:16.625
maybe right now
what you need to be doing

12:16.625 --> 12:19.458
is exploring
and embracing your freedom

12:19.458 --> 12:23.625
and figuring out what it is
that you really, really want.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.208
The problem
with your plan...

12:30.208 --> 12:32.792
is that I already know
what I want.

12:34.542 --> 12:37.583
You're not
offering it to me.

12:37.583 --> 12:42.291
So it's my sober birthday
next week-- four months.

12:42.291 --> 12:44.583
Oh, cool.
What are you gonna do?

12:44.583 --> 12:46.500
Uh, I don't know.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.625
Laser tag, bumper cars
or something.

12:49.625 --> 12:50.834
You'll probably
have plans,

12:50.834 --> 12:54.291
so it'll just be me alone
at Chuck E. Cheese again.

12:57.166 --> 12:59.333
When's yours?

12:59.333 --> 13:03.834
I used to have one,
but then I... didn't.

13:03.834 --> 13:05.625
Well, make another one
then, no?

13:05.625 --> 13:07.375
No, you only get
one birthday.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.166
Oh.

13:09.166 --> 13:11.166
But if you're serious
about actually doing
something,

13:11.166 --> 13:12.875
I'm-- I'm in.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.875
Oh, okay.
I'll keep that in mind.

13:15.875 --> 13:19.000
How have your nights been
with what's-her-face?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.583
( laughs )

13:21.583 --> 13:24.583
- Good, good, good.
- Right.

13:24.583 --> 13:27.000
It's not like I see her
every day or anything.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.792
You're a liar.

13:28.792 --> 13:30.834
I mean, it's cute.
It's very funny.

13:30.834 --> 13:32.375
But, you know.

13:32.375 --> 13:34.750
I really have to pee.
Can you hold my bag a sec?

13:34.750 --> 13:36.542
I'll be one second.
I just--

13:36.542 --> 13:39.375
Adam:
You're-- you're gonna
do that here?

13:39.375 --> 13:43.875
I'm not waiting for a park
or, like, stepping into
a restaurant.

13:43.875 --> 13:46.834
Jesus fucking--
okay.

13:48.166 --> 13:50.041
( groans )

13:51.125 --> 13:52.166
Okay, cop, cop,
cop, cop, cop.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.375
- What--?
- ( siren chirps )

13:53.375 --> 13:54.750
Put a plug in it.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.166
( siren chirping )

13:57.166 --> 13:58.542
Are you serious?

13:58.542 --> 14:00.750
Sorry.
All done here, Officer.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.250
Sorry, Officer,
she's foreign.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.834
You can't piss
in the street, miss.

14:03.834 --> 14:05.917
Oh, come on.
Are you gonna write me up?

14:05.917 --> 14:07.625
- Yeah.
- Why don't you
write the city up

14:07.625 --> 14:09.667
for not having enough places
for women to piss in?

14:09.667 --> 14:11.583
- All right, Jessa.
- Are you kidding me?

14:11.583 --> 14:14.125
There's a toilet like
every 17 blocks, you know.

14:15.250 --> 14:16.375
This is insane.

14:16.375 --> 14:17.667
( ticket tears )

14:17.667 --> 14:20.917
This is your summons.
You'll pay a $50 fine,
all right?

14:20.917 --> 14:23.250
Are you serious?
( laughs )

14:23.250 --> 14:25.583
Why don't I just send you
the bill from my gynecologist

14:25.583 --> 14:27.417
when I get a UTI
from holding it in?

14:27.417 --> 14:29.083
No.

14:29.083 --> 14:30.250
Now, ma'am, you didn't
want to do that.

14:30.250 --> 14:32.959
You know what?
I'm tired of being
complacent. Bye.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.834
Turn around.
Stop walking.
Turn around.

14:34.834 --> 14:36.458
- You're under arrest.
- ( laughs )

14:36.458 --> 14:38.458
You're under arrest.
Do not resist.

14:38.458 --> 14:39.917
Ow, ow!
Come on, that hurts.

14:39.917 --> 14:41.959
- He's hurting her.
Stop, you're hurting her!
- Jessa: That hurts!

14:41.959 --> 14:43.750
- She's fine, she's fine.
- Stop resisting. Ma'am--

14:43.750 --> 14:45.458
- Ma'am-- hey, hey, hey!
- Would you stop?
You're hurting--

14:45.458 --> 14:46.959
- Get this guy off me!
Hey, knock it off!
- All right.

14:46.959 --> 14:49.417
- You're done.
Come over here.
- And you be still.

14:55.125 --> 14:58.000
( chatter )

14:58.000 --> 15:00.792
( music playing inside )

15:17.875 --> 15:21.333
Yeah, she literally said
that the guys from Green Day
wanted to have sex with her.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.333
- That's disgusting.
- Ugh.

15:23.333 --> 15:25.166
Zed, Zed,
do another bong hit,

15:25.166 --> 15:26.583
okay, 'cause by the time
I took the picture,

15:26.583 --> 15:29.834
the smoke wasn't in that
whimsical cloud shape anymore.

15:29.834 --> 15:31.834
( water bubbles )

15:33.500 --> 15:35.458
- ( shutter clicks )
- Oh, the whimsy.

15:35.458 --> 15:36.834
God, I love the poets.

15:36.834 --> 15:38.583
This party sucks dick.

15:38.583 --> 15:40.000
What are you talking about?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
The twins who live here
have legal access

15:42.000 --> 15:43.875
to medicinal mushrooms
and ecstasy.

15:43.875 --> 15:46.500
I mean, it's like,
you're welcome.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.333
I really don't feel good.
I think I have mono.

15:49.333 --> 15:52.000
- For the fifth time?
- Yeah.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.458
Maybe it's finally
something more serious.

15:55.458 --> 15:57.125
( gasps )
Lilly, Lilly,

15:57.125 --> 15:59.250
show me
those diminutive
little nips.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.417
- ( shutter clicks )
- Elijah: Yeah.

16:01.417 --> 16:02.708
What are you doing?

16:02.708 --> 16:04.500
Did you, like, watch
the Bill Cunningham
documentary?

16:04.500 --> 16:06.875
Why are you taking
so many pictures?

16:06.875 --> 16:09.000
I just realized I got
so good at taking selfies,

16:09.000 --> 16:10.875
I wasn't feeling
challenged anymore.

16:10.875 --> 16:12.041
And then I thought,

16:12.041 --> 16:16.041
"What would
happen if I turned
the camera around?"

16:17.375 --> 16:19.500
It was a real epiphany
for me, Hannah.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.458
I feel really uncomfortable.
Everyone from my program's here.

16:22.458 --> 16:24.125
I don't want
to be here right now.

16:24.125 --> 16:25.708
It's just because
you hot-rolled your hair.

16:25.708 --> 16:28.500
It's just you.
You're uncomfortable
in your own skin

16:28.500 --> 16:30.291
and you think
it's everybody
else's problem.

16:30.291 --> 16:34.458
But you know what?
Wherever you are,
there you go.

16:34.458 --> 16:35.917
Is that the quote?

16:35.917 --> 16:37.542
Does that sound right?

16:37.542 --> 16:40.708
Tito, what are you doing?
( smooches )

16:40.708 --> 16:43.041
It's just like everybody's
saying it's such a gift,
you know,

16:43.041 --> 16:45.542
to have all this time to write,
but then how come the only
thing I want to do

16:45.542 --> 16:49.250
is Google the one month where
Woody Harrelson and Glenn Close
were a couple?

16:49.250 --> 16:50.750
This is what
you always do, okay?

16:50.750 --> 16:53.834
It's like in college
when you would cry and cry
into your tater tots

16:53.834 --> 16:55.542
about not getting
your papers done on time,

16:55.542 --> 16:57.291
but somehow you would always
get those papers done.

16:57.291 --> 16:58.959
Yeah, but Marnie wrote
like half those papers,

16:58.959 --> 17:01.583
and now I'm in school
for the thing I actually
want to do,

17:01.583 --> 17:03.458
so shouldn't I actually
want to do it?

17:03.458 --> 17:05.583
No, that's not
how it works.

17:05.583 --> 17:08.250
Nobody likes
what they do.

17:08.250 --> 17:11.583
Do you think Dakota Fanning
wants to be Dakota Fanning?

17:11.583 --> 17:12.750
100%.

17:12.750 --> 17:14.250
Being Dakota Fanning
is amazing.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.959
You get so many
free boots.

17:15.959 --> 17:18.250
Well, if that's how you feel,
why are you even trying?

17:18.250 --> 17:20.165
Because I'm a writer
and that's what I do.

17:20.165 --> 17:23.583
Well, I was a dancer,
but you don't see me
five-six-seven-eighting

17:23.583 --> 17:24.916
my way into rooms
anymore, do you?

17:24.916 --> 17:27.625
And when you
let that go...

17:27.625 --> 17:28.792
what was that like?

17:28.792 --> 17:32.125
It was the biggest relief
in the world.

17:34.542 --> 17:36.208
- Hannah?
- Mm-hmm.

17:36.208 --> 17:38.625
Everything works out
the way it should.

17:42.458 --> 17:45.125
This side of the room
needs to be sexier.

17:45.125 --> 17:47.125
That's good.
That's really prom-y.

17:47.125 --> 17:48.834
( music playing )

17:48.834 --> 17:53.000
( sings along )
♪ You got me doin'
funny things like a clown ♪

17:53.000 --> 17:56.333
- ♪ Just look at me... ♪
- ( phone buzzing )

17:56.333 --> 17:57.458
Ploshansky.

17:57.458 --> 17:59.959
♪ When you wear
your high-heeled boots... ♪

17:59.959 --> 18:01.667
What?

18:02.792 --> 18:05.500
Are you fucking kidding me?

18:05.500 --> 18:07.166
When?

18:08.625 --> 18:10.083
Both of you?

18:10.083 --> 18:12.875
Chandra:
You know what I really hate
is this cross-pollination,

18:12.875 --> 18:15.959
like blogs becoming books,
which then become TV shows.

18:15.959 --> 18:17.208
Yeah, don't worry,
just breathe.

18:17.208 --> 18:19.959
Nobody's gonna force you
to watch "The Fault
in Our Stars."

18:19.959 --> 18:23.333
- ( all laugh )
- You guys sound so old.

18:23.333 --> 18:27.000
And I don't get
why we're so judgy
about popular writing.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.500
I write one story
with a blowjob in it

18:28.500 --> 18:30.041
and suddenly I'm
"Fifty Shades of Grey" girl.

18:30.041 --> 18:32.125
Yeah, that wasn't just
because of the blowjob,
Hannah.

18:32.125 --> 18:35.041
Yeah, some stories
about blowjobs have
literary merit.

18:35.041 --> 18:37.291
Yeah,
like D.H. Lawrence,

18:37.291 --> 18:39.333
Henry Miller,
Philip Roth,
Martin Amis.

18:39.333 --> 18:40.834
Ha!

18:40.834 --> 18:42.250
Ha?
What ha?

18:42.250 --> 18:45.250
Ha, you only named writers
with penises.

18:45.250 --> 18:48.041
- Oh, snap.
- She has a point.
She has a point.

18:48.041 --> 18:49.917
Chandra:
Yeah, how are you
gonna answer that, D?

18:49.917 --> 18:51.208
Uh, with an "And?"

18:51.208 --> 18:53.291
And it's the same kind
of patriarchal bullshit

18:53.291 --> 18:55.375
female authors have been
dealing with for centuries.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.375
- You're part of it.
- Take it easy.

18:57.375 --> 18:59.959
You're starting to sound
a little hysterical here, okay?

18:59.959 --> 19:02.500
- ( laughs )
- ( exhales ) Hysteria?

19:02.500 --> 19:05.708
Hysteria is how
they diagnosed women

19:05.708 --> 19:08.208
who they found uppity
in the 1800s

19:08.208 --> 19:10.375
and had an excuse
to remove their ovaries.

19:10.375 --> 19:11.542
That was not my intent.

19:11.542 --> 19:13.083
I was just saying it's getting
a little electric in here.

19:13.083 --> 19:14.542
Chandra:
You're missing
her points here.

19:14.542 --> 19:18.250
Being pigeonholed
isn't fun.

19:18.250 --> 19:20.291
And if you guys doubt me,

19:20.291 --> 19:23.375
why don't you take a turn
in the hot seat?

19:23.375 --> 19:24.959
For example,
look at Jeffrey.

19:24.959 --> 19:26.708
What a little rich,
whiney white guy.

19:26.708 --> 19:30.458
Thinks he's Updike,
thinks it's a revolution
that he hates his parents.

19:30.458 --> 19:32.583
You probably
only have one ball.

19:32.583 --> 19:35.417
I have two balls,
thank you.

19:35.417 --> 19:37.750
I don't know why
you're laughing, Chester.

19:37.750 --> 19:40.166
You are a tragically hip
gaysian...

19:40.166 --> 19:41.750
Thank you.

19:41.750 --> 19:47.041
...who is writing
manic-pixie-dream-girl-
pseudo-"Weetzie Bat" bullshit.

19:47.041 --> 19:49.625
Your whole story was just like
a winky-eye emoji

19:49.625 --> 19:50.708
followed by a poop emoji.

19:50.708 --> 19:52.166
- D. August: Dude.
- ( Priya laughs )

19:52.166 --> 19:53.750
- Chandra.
- All right, yeah.

19:53.750 --> 19:55.750
We started out as friends,
now I'm not so sure.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.458
But you were blessed
with an exotic name

19:57.458 --> 19:59.500
and now you get to be
the first and foremost
authority

19:59.500 --> 20:01.959
on third-world issues
here in Iowa.

20:01.959 --> 20:03.250
- Huh.
- Dude!

20:03.250 --> 20:04.375
- Priya.
- Hmm?

20:04.375 --> 20:06.166
If you keep writing
about prison in the South,

20:06.166 --> 20:09.166
I'm gonna murder
someone and go to prison
right here in Iowa.

20:09.166 --> 20:12.291
- Logan.
- Bring it, Hannah.
What?

20:12.291 --> 20:15.000
You are the most
bad mood Millie.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.250
There's like a storm cloud
over our whole classroom.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.250
Get it together.
Take an Ativan.

20:19.250 --> 20:21.166
You have no idea
what medications

20:21.166 --> 20:23.125
I'm already on,
frankly, Hannah.

20:23.125 --> 20:24.959
And we've got D. August.

20:24.959 --> 20:26.500
- ( scoffs )
- I know, I know.

20:26.500 --> 20:29.291
We don't mention D. August
because he's the golden boy
of our program

20:29.291 --> 20:32.333
and we're all busy, you know,
licking his anus, his balls,
and his taint.

20:32.333 --> 20:34.375
Somebody's licking my balls?
I didn't know that.

20:34.375 --> 20:37.750
- Thank you, guys.
- But this "patron saint
of the streets" thing,

20:37.750 --> 20:39.792
it's bullshit.
We know it.

20:39.792 --> 20:41.667
This is not
a hardened criminal.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.792
This guy's
never been to jail.

20:43.792 --> 20:45.083
Can I see your record?

20:45.083 --> 20:48.917
Can I see
your criminal record?

20:48.917 --> 20:52.166
Guys, this is
what history does to us.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.834
And I don't want to be
the only one who's honest.

20:54.834 --> 20:58.166
I want us to be honest
together.

21:11.083 --> 21:15.000
I think it's better
that you guys chew on
all this without me.

21:17.083 --> 21:18.375
Really soak it in.

21:18.375 --> 21:22.333
I have to go now.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.166
( thuds )

21:26.166 --> 21:29.667
Chandra:
I think we just found
our own Lindsay Lohan.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.834
That was
some fucked-up shit.

21:31.834 --> 21:33.041
( siren wailing )

21:33.041 --> 21:36.125
I hope you goons
are fuckin' proud
of yourselves.

21:36.125 --> 21:38.208
We didn't do anything.

21:39.417 --> 21:41.333
- You didn't do
anything?
- No.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.792
You guys are a pair
of barbarians.

21:43.792 --> 21:45.125
You know that?

21:45.125 --> 21:46.875
We live
in a civil society

21:46.875 --> 21:50.208
that's buttressed by decency
and respect, okay?

21:50.208 --> 21:52.750
We don't resist arrest
when we've done something
wrong.

21:52.750 --> 21:54.625
We don't tackle
police officers.

21:54.625 --> 21:57.500
And we sure as fuck do not
urinate on the sidewalk!

21:57.500 --> 22:01.041
It was abuse.
It was Stop and Frisk.

22:01.041 --> 22:03.708
You cretins owe me
three grand.

22:03.708 --> 22:05.333
Three grand!

22:05.333 --> 22:06.542
( car door closes )

22:06.542 --> 22:09.375
- ( tires squeal )
- ( horn honks )

22:09.375 --> 22:13.125
( police radio chatter )

22:13.125 --> 22:15.291
Fuckin' hate cops.

22:17.250 --> 22:22.583
Fuzz, po-po, pigs.

22:26.333 --> 22:28.458
Okay, later.

22:28.458 --> 22:29.625
Where are you going?

22:29.625 --> 22:31.583
I'm not doing this
with you.

22:31.583 --> 22:32.750
What?

22:32.750 --> 22:34.375
Adam, you saw
what they were doing.

22:34.375 --> 22:36.583
Grow up.

22:36.583 --> 22:39.000
You're a bad influence.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.500
I'm a bad influence.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.750
You're an adult man.
I can't be an influence.

22:42.750 --> 22:44.417
You know, I saw this
all the time with you
and Hannah--

22:44.417 --> 22:46.750
you getting her
into these fucking
ridiculous situations,

22:46.750 --> 22:50.250
walking away, just being
fucking manipulative.

22:50.250 --> 22:52.208
I had sympathy
because I knew
you had a problem,

22:52.208 --> 22:56.250
but you're sober
and you're still
pulling this shit.

22:56.250 --> 22:59.458
What are you
trying to provoke?

22:59.458 --> 23:02.208
You know what?
I don't even want to--
I don't want to know.

23:02.208 --> 23:04.125
It's, uh...

23:04.125 --> 23:07.500
I don't have time for this.
I don't need any more friends.

23:07.500 --> 23:10.458
Oh, so none
is enough for you?

23:15.792 --> 23:18.000
Adam, I do.

23:18.959 --> 23:20.625
Please.

23:23.125 --> 23:26.959
Adam, I really need you
to be my friend.

23:26.959 --> 23:29.250
- ( music playing )
- Yeah, we do.

23:29.250 --> 23:31.125
Yeah, we really do.

23:31.125 --> 23:33.667
( chatter continues )

23:48.458 --> 23:51.667
( crowd chattering )

23:53.583 --> 23:57.208
( crowd cheering,
chanting )

23:57.208 --> 23:59.792
