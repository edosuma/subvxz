Oh, my God. Wait.

00:06.073 --> 00:08.833
<i>..11 teams of

Go!

00:11.073 --> 00:13.393
Go! (LAUGHTER)

00:13.393 --> 00:14.473
We're going to Mexico!

00:14.473 --> 00:18.303
<i>In Mexico City, teams

00:18.303 --> 00:19.303
(YELLS)

00:19.303 --> 00:20.303
Ah!

00:20.303 --> 00:21.433
OK, we got 'em! We got 'em!

00:21.433 --> 00:24.353
<i>..and an explosive
start to the race.</i>

Bye, friends!

00:32.153 --> 00:34.033
<i>..while Scott fell to pieces.</i>

00:34.033 --> 00:35.793
I'm making big mistakes.

00:35.793 --> 00:37.473
So panicked.

00:37.473 --> 00:39.433
Oh, this is getting
desperate now.

00:39.433 --> 00:41.223
<i>After a cab race
to the Pit Stop...</i>

00:41.223 --> 00:43.273
Oh, my God. No, no, no.

Oh, my God. We
passed the Dancers.

You are team number one!

Come on, Daddy. -<i>Father and

00:52.393 --> 00:53.393

00:53.393 --> 00:56.593
I'm very sorry to tell you that
you are the last team to arrive.

00:56.593 --> 00:58.753
<i>..but got some shocking news.</i>

00:58.753 --> 01:00.753
You're not
eliminated. -Oh, my God!

01:00.753 --> 01:02.193
That's impossible.

01:02.193 --> 01:04.553
Why are you so excited
about being on this race?

01:04.553 --> 01:06.873
I think it's the
experience with my dad.

01:06.873 --> 01:11.063
You know, he's worked a lot and I
moved away from home kind of early

01:11.063 --> 01:14.513
and we didn't really get as much
time together as we wish we had

01:14.513 --> 01:17.873
and this is kind of our chance
to travel the world together

01:17.873 --> 01:18.873
and be together.

01:18.873 --> 01:21.983
How do you catch up at this
point, Scott? What do you do?

01:21.983 --> 01:23.713
I have a way. -Yeah? Tell me.

01:23.713 --> 01:25.993
I'm gonna take everything
out of my bag and just...

01:25.993 --> 01:27.393
Did you over-pack?

01:27.393 --> 01:28.793
I... Oh, Phil.

01:28.793 --> 01:30.673
You didn't bring a hair
dryer or anything, did you?

01:30.673 --> 01:32.633
I brought a hair dryer
and a curling iron!

01:32.633 --> 01:34.073
You did not bring
a hair dryer? -I did.

01:34.073 --> 01:35.553
You brought a hair dryer
on The Amazing Race?

01:35.553 --> 01:36.833
And a curling iron.

01:36.833 --> 01:39.513
Does your dad know that
you brought a hair dryer?

01:39.513 --> 01:40.753
He's carrying it for me.

01:40.753 --> 01:42.673
Your dad is carrying your...?

01:42.673 --> 01:44.433
I have a blow dryer.

01:44.433 --> 01:46.273
I have my curling iron.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.193
Did you want it? Did you
want me to give it to you?

01:48.193 --> 01:50.223
No, I've got
nothing left to curl.

02:47.711 --> 02:49.191
Alright.

02:49.191 --> 02:50.311
Let's see where we're going.

02:50.311 --> 02:53.351
"Fly to the walled city
of Cartagena, Colombia."

02:53.351 --> 02:55.991
<i>This is the first time
that The Amazing Race</i>

02:55.991 --> 02:58.951
<i>has been to the
Republic of Colombia</i>

02:58.951 --> 03:02.311
and the city of Cartagena,
a World Heritage site

03:02.311 --> 03:06.431
that has a wonderful mix of
colonial and modern architecture.

03:06.431 --> 03:09.911
<i>The team's first destination
is here at Totumo,</i>

03:09.911 --> 03:12.191
<i>where things are
guaranteed to get messy.</i>

03:12.191 --> 03:13.431
Airport?

03:13.431 --> 03:15.831
We've been engaged for
almost three and a half years.

03:15.831 --> 03:17.471
We have not set a
wedding date yet.

03:17.471 --> 03:19.951
I did maybe
influence Matt into

03:19.951 --> 03:21.431
getting engaged
before he was ready.

03:21.431 --> 03:22.431
Come on, come on.

03:22.431 --> 03:25.631
We're at a crossroads
right now where our careers

03:25.631 --> 03:28.551
are really exploding and we
need to find that balance.

03:28.551 --> 03:30.191
I believe in taking a leap

03:30.191 --> 03:33.071
and he's more like the
machine has to work perfectly

03:33.071 --> 03:34.991
before we commit to anything.

03:34.991 --> 03:36.911
OK, come on, let's go.

03:36.911 --> 03:38.191
There's the other team.

03:38.191 --> 03:39.951
Just follow them.

03:39.951 --> 03:43.151
I don't think we ever put out onto
the internet how competitive we are.

03:43.151 --> 03:45.471
A lot of teams will
see what we do online

03:45.471 --> 03:49.311
and think it's just playful
or non-competitive or goofy.

03:49.311 --> 03:53.231
They don't know how athletic we
are or how competitive we are.

03:53.231 --> 03:56.271
Leg one was love-fest,
non-elimination.

03:56.271 --> 03:58.071
Leg two
- get rid of someone.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.791
We're going to Cuba!

03:59.791 --> 04:01.511
No, we're going to Colombia.

04:01.511 --> 04:03.351
I always want to be connected

04:03.351 --> 04:06.791
and I've become so dependant on my
phone, I constantly reach for it.

04:06.791 --> 04:10.391
We have a month where we don't have
the phones with us, so we talk more.

04:10.391 --> 04:12.671
So, I'm excited for
that, a little selfishly.

04:12.671 --> 04:13.671
Kiss.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.671
Hola. -Hola.

04:15.671 --> 04:16.911
Gracias, gracias.

04:16.911 --> 04:19.471
Anybody who's watched my
vines could probably infer

04:19.471 --> 04:21.701
that I'm pretty intelligent, that
we're both pretty intelligent.

04:21.701 --> 04:25.231
I was entered into Mensa
after I took an IQ test.

04:25.231 --> 04:27.631
We can both solve a Rubik's
Cube in under a minute.

04:27.631 --> 04:29.311
We look at The Amazing
Race as just, like,

04:29.311 --> 04:32.671
the ultimate challenge
to prove our aptitude.

04:32.671 --> 04:34.351
We've got this in
the bag. -No mistakes.

04:34.351 --> 04:35.351
No mistakes.

04:35.351 --> 04:36.751
Front of the pack looks good.

04:38.021 --> 04:39.831
Cartagena, Colombia! -Colombia!

04:39.831 --> 04:41.951
BRODIE: Last leg, we
didn't finish up there

04:41.951 --> 04:43.111
but we were definitely close

04:43.111 --> 04:45.111
and this leg, we'll definitely
finish in the top three.

04:45.111 --> 04:46.991
Playing ultimate Frisbee
together for 10 years,

04:46.991 --> 04:50.671
we've had a lot of ups and downs and
already having done that together,

04:50.671 --> 04:52.701
I think that gives us a leg
up on some of the other racers.

04:52.701 --> 04:54.631
Very important,
very important.

04:54.631 --> 04:56.311
Got to get that early flight.

04:56.311 --> 04:57.951
Baby, it's South America.
We're going to South America.

04:57.951 --> 04:59.791
We're going to South America.
-I've never been to South America.

04:59.791 --> 05:00.791
It's a whole new continent.

05:00.791 --> 05:02.231
That's exciting. -That's
going to be awesome.

05:04.551 --> 05:06.071
These are all ticket counters.

05:06.071 --> 05:07.071
These? -Yeah.

05:07.071 --> 05:09.871
We need to get there
the earliest arrival.

05:12.991 --> 05:15.021
Yes, we'll take it. Take
it. Yes, we we'll book it.

05:15.021 --> 05:17.311
Cartagena, right? -Si.

05:17.311 --> 05:20.111
We are on a first fight
that leaves at 6:00.

05:21.311 --> 05:23.271
I mean, is this a line?

05:23.271 --> 05:25.511
Being assertive is kind of
hard for me to do a lot of times

05:25.511 --> 05:28.111
'cause I just have a kind of
a natural laid-back mentality.

05:28.111 --> 05:31.751
Tickets are disappearing as
other teams get the connections.

05:31.751 --> 05:34.151
That's where being assertive
would have come in handy.

05:34.151 --> 05:36.031
Let's book this ticket.
-OK. -Let's book it.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.031
So, we're going to book this

05:37.031 --> 05:38.391
and we're going to get
in at 9:00 in the morning.

05:38.391 --> 05:40.951
So, we have our ticket to
Cartagena, right? We're good?

05:40.951 --> 05:43.551
We're all together,
we're all tied for first.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.631
That means we're all
tied for first. Hopefully!

05:47.911 --> 05:49.711
Thanks, man. Cool.

05:49.711 --> 05:51.271
Thank you very much.
-No problem, man.

05:51.271 --> 05:52.311
Good to meet you.
-Thank you.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.711
Hasta luego, senor.
Muchas gracias.

05:54.711 --> 05:55.711
Let's go.

05:55.711 --> 05:58.151
I think, being a flight attendant,
I definitely have the experience

05:58.151 --> 05:59.991
in getting, you
know, airplane tickets

05:59.991 --> 06:02.631
and manoeuvring my
way through airports.

06:02.631 --> 06:03.791
What was it, Colombia?

06:03.791 --> 06:05.991
BOTH: (SHOUT)
Cartagena, Colombia!

06:05.991 --> 06:07.711
Aargh!

06:07.711 --> 06:10.031
I don't whether to
be excited or nervous.

06:10.031 --> 06:12.431
This is crazy! Can
I get a high five?

06:12.431 --> 06:13.511
Yes! -Yes!

06:14.831 --> 06:17.791
If we can get on an earlier flight
than some of the other teams,

06:17.791 --> 06:20.751
we could really use that advantage
because we have a Speed Bump to do.

06:20.751 --> 06:22.711
We're going to need to get
a few breaks here, aren't we?

06:22.711 --> 06:23.991
Yeah. -Yeah.

06:23.991 --> 06:26.511
Seconds could matter here to
get on the first flight. -Yeah.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.831
Wonder what the other
teams did. -I don't know.

06:30.751 --> 06:32.391
Book that one.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.871
9:30 in the morning.
-That's great. OK.

06:36.751 --> 06:38.271
OK. We'll take
that. -We'll take it.

06:38.271 --> 06:40.951
9:37. -Arriving at 9:37?

06:40.951 --> 06:45.031
Hi. We need to get to Cartagena,
Colombia, as soon as possible.

06:45.031 --> 06:46.871
Please, please, please.
We're in a huge rush.

06:46.871 --> 06:50.391
We need to go to Cartagena,
Colombia, as fast as possible.

06:50.391 --> 06:51.391
Rapido.

06:51.391 --> 06:53.191
Pretty please.

06:54.431 --> 06:55.431
OK.

06:59.751 --> 07:02.031
9:37. Oh, my gosh,
I could kiss you!

07:02.031 --> 07:03.351
We'll take it.
-Yes, yes, yes.

07:03.351 --> 07:04.351
We want that one. Yes.

07:07.391 --> 07:09.071
Oh, my God. Are
you kidding me?

07:09.071 --> 07:12.551

gracias. Un beso. Mwah!

07:12.551 --> 07:14.191
God, this is so frustrating.

07:14.191 --> 07:16.471
We all got here about
the same time and somehow,

07:16.471 --> 07:18.111
we're the only one that
ended up on a later flight.

07:18.111 --> 07:20.191
It's just frustrating that we
went to the wrong person in line.

07:20.191 --> 07:22.111
I just don't understand
why we got here before them

07:22.111 --> 07:23.111
and got a later flight.

07:23.111 --> 07:25.511
Let me guess.
There's no seats left.

07:28.271 --> 07:30.391
Alright. Let's get...
Let's get that one, then.

07:34.111 --> 07:37.751
It did not look like we were
going to make it. Oh, my God.

07:37.751 --> 07:40.031
Cartagena, Colombia.

07:40.031 --> 07:43.751
We're excited. It's going to be an
interesting, interesting journey.

You know, we're not in the
best place that we want to be

08:00.831 --> 08:02.471
but we're just going to
have to run as fast as we can

08:02.471 --> 08:04.351
and try to make up as
much time as we can.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.751
We're praying for tailwind.

08:05.751 --> 08:08.991
Due to a lack of competitive
initiative, something like that,

08:08.991 --> 08:10.151
we got the last flight.

08:10.151 --> 08:13.071
But we've caught up
before, so we're, you know,

08:13.071 --> 08:14.631
feeling pretty confident
that we can do it

08:14.631 --> 08:16.271
if we don't make
any more mistakes.

Vamos! Vamos!
Vamos! Very quick.

Colombia has dozens of volcanoes,
including Volcan Totumo,

that provides this
rich, therapeutic mud,

08:58.865 --> 09:01.425

than 2,000 feet deep.

this huge pit of mud.

like muddy water in the middle,

outsides was all mud.

09:38.105 --> 09:41.305
I was kind of nervous because I was
like, "How deep does this thing go?"

09:41.305 --> 09:42.305
Whoo!

09:44.015 --> 09:46.225
Go, babe. Go, go,
go. Careful, babe.

09:46.225 --> 09:47.895
Yeah, Brodie!

09:47.895 --> 09:49.785
I've got to find a satchel.

09:49.785 --> 09:51.785
I was just using my long
arms and hopefully...

09:51.785 --> 09:53.545
I finally felt, like, a rope

09:53.545 --> 09:56.505
and then I led it in my hand to
a satchel and I just ripped it.

09:56.505 --> 09:58.505
Aargh! I got it!

09:59.985 --> 10:01.625
I got it, Kurt!

10:01.625 --> 10:02.745
Yeah, Brodie!

10:02.745 --> 10:05.065
Climbed up the ladder and
then that's when I revealed

10:05.065 --> 10:06.895
what was inside and
it was the emerald.

10:06.895 --> 10:08.185
Yeah, Brodie!

10:10.345 --> 10:11.505
Get it, babe. Get it!

10:11.505 --> 10:13.585
Looks like he got the
emerald. Looking good, man!

10:13.585 --> 10:15.825
Yeah, Brodie!
Just be careful.

10:15.825 --> 10:17.015
Just be careful, baby.

10:17.015 --> 10:19.345
Oh, my God.

10:19.345 --> 10:22.705
OK. Wow, it's deep.

10:22.705 --> 10:23.945
Ah!

10:23.945 --> 10:26.185
I can't go down! Holy crap.

10:26.185 --> 10:28.065
It was like quicksand.

10:30.015 --> 10:31.545
It's disgusting.

10:33.785 --> 10:35.065
Ooh! This is cute.

10:35.065 --> 10:37.135
Alright, I'm going to the lagoon.
-Be careful. Just be careful.

10:37.135 --> 10:38.425
Lagoon, lagoon,
lagoon! -Just be careful.

10:38.425 --> 10:40.865
Oh, the Clue Box is out there!

10:40.865 --> 10:43.185
Yeah, Brods, we're in
first. Just be careful.

10:43.185 --> 10:44.385
An emerald!

10:46.065 --> 10:47.545
Good? -Por alla.

10:47.545 --> 10:50.425
Brody's going to the Clue
Box, which is out in the water.

10:50.425 --> 10:52.745
Whoo! Yeah, Brodie!

10:52.745 --> 10:55.015
Do it! Yeah, Brods!

10:55.015 --> 10:57.425
Come on, Brods!
You got this, baby!

10:59.505 --> 11:01.145
I can't breathe.

11:01.145 --> 11:02.385
OK.

11:02.385 --> 11:05.145
Let's hope Dana can find
it quick and get up here.

11:05.145 --> 11:06.825
Is it an emerald?

11:06.825 --> 11:08.585
Buenos dias.
-Buenos dias.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.145
Come one, Dana. You got it.

11:10.145 --> 11:13.385
I have a pink thing. I don't
know if that's an emerald.

11:13.385 --> 11:15.225
I'm going to
come down and try.

11:15.225 --> 11:17.105
Be careful coming
down. It's slippery.

11:17.105 --> 11:18.545
BOTH: "Who is a hot mess?"

11:18.545 --> 11:20.385
I am. -Are you alright?
You going to do it?

11:20.385 --> 11:22.305
"Who is a hot mess?" I am.
-"Who's a hot mess?"

11:22.305 --> 11:23.425
Korey is, Korey is!

11:23.425 --> 11:25.665
Yeah, Brodie! -There
was an inch of water.

11:25.665 --> 11:28.745
It was quicksand, mud
and an inch of water.

11:28.745 --> 11:31.545
You couldn't really kick, and
so I ended up just grabbing mud

11:31.545 --> 11:33.665
and just pulling
myself to the Clue Box.

11:33.665 --> 11:34.945
Come on, baby!

11:34.945 --> 11:36.985
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

11:36.985 --> 11:39.505
Come on, baby! He looks
like he's struggling a bit.

11:39.505 --> 11:41.465
I think he's a little bit winded,
but he's doing a great job,

11:41.465 --> 11:42.465
he's in first place.

11:42.465 --> 11:44.065
Alright, let's read this clue.

11:44.065 --> 11:45.265
Come on, buddy.

11:45.265 --> 11:47.265
(WOMEN LAUGH)

11:47.265 --> 11:48.545
OK. Route info.

11:48.545 --> 11:51.665
"Make your way to Mello

11:51.665 --> 11:53.025

your next clue."

11:55.065 --> 11:56.625
Let's go. -Aargh! -Let's go!

11:56.625 --> 11:58.585
Come on, baby.
Let's go, baby! -Whoo!

11:58.585 --> 11:59.745
(BOTH WHOOP)

11:59.745 --> 12:01.825
Oh, it sounds like
a team's finished.

12:01.825 --> 12:03.545
Ashley, you can do it, baby!

12:03.545 --> 12:06.345
I can't believe I'm doing
this! This is so crazy.

12:06.345 --> 12:07.865
Oh!

12:07.865 --> 12:09.825
I thought it would be colder,
it's actually really nice.

12:11.825 --> 12:12.825
Oh!

12:12.825 --> 12:14.145
(SQUEALS)

12:19.545 --> 12:21.385
You got this, Kor.

12:21.385 --> 12:23.745
Si? It's good? Good?

12:23.745 --> 12:25.745
This is good?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.025
I guess it's not right.

12:27.025 --> 12:28.425
Come on, Dana.

12:28.425 --> 12:30.385
Come on, Ash. You can do it!

12:30.385 --> 12:31.825
Got it. OK.

12:38.185 --> 12:39.705
Ashley's got a satchel.

12:41.185 --> 12:43.025
Does not every bag
have an emerald?

12:43.025 --> 12:44.025
That is not green.

12:44.025 --> 12:45.705
I'm looking for an emerald.

12:45.705 --> 12:48.945
Got it. Found it
on my first try.

12:48.945 --> 12:52.945
Oh, my God. (LAUGHS)

12:52.945 --> 12:54.225
Korey!

12:54.225 --> 12:56.225
I dropped my emerald
but I'll get it!

12:56.225 --> 12:58.505
Korey looked like
a gremlin, like,

12:58.505 --> 13:01.425
coming out of, like,
the depths of the earth!

13:01.425 --> 13:03.265
You look like Gollum!

13:03.265 --> 13:05.265
(LAUGHS) Looking for the ring.

13:05.265 --> 13:06.305
(LAUGHS)

13:11.185 --> 13:13.945
Oh. Damn, girl. Careful.

13:17.385 --> 13:19.785
Korey dropped the emerald.

13:19.785 --> 13:21.705
Where did it go? It was green.

13:23.025 --> 13:24.185
Oh.

13:24.185 --> 13:25.305
OK, babe, I got it.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.225
You got it? Good
job, good job!

13:27.225 --> 13:29.745
It's green! I got it!

13:29.745 --> 13:31.145
Yeah! You got it?

13:31.145 --> 13:32.585
I got it! -Alright, alright.

13:32.585 --> 13:34.945
Ah, so much...! Got
some mud in my butt.

13:34.945 --> 13:37.465
Korey's going back up again.
He's going to try a second time.

13:37.465 --> 13:38.465
He's going to get it.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.785
Colombia!

13:42.785 --> 13:44.105
Alright, let's go.

13:44.105 --> 13:45.105
Let's go, let's go.

13:45.105 --> 13:46.225
Rapido, rapido!

13:46.225 --> 13:48.385
Totumo? -Totumo? -Si.

13:48.385 --> 13:51.745
Our cab's passing everyone. Now
we're passing Joslyn and Erin.

13:51.745 --> 13:53.945
JOSLYN AND ERIN: (YELL) No!

13:53.945 --> 13:55.025
Oh, she's cute.

13:55.025 --> 13:56.505
Si! Si! Si!

13:56.505 --> 13:58.225
(BOTH WHOOP)

13:58.225 --> 14:00.345
(GASPS) Oh, my
God. -That's Sheri.

14:00.345 --> 14:01.985
Sheri and Cole just passed us.

14:01.985 --> 14:04.105
We just passed the models!

14:04.105 --> 14:05.705
You got this, Kor!

14:09.665 --> 14:12.705
He just emerged. He's going to
look and see if he's got an emerald.

14:12.705 --> 14:14.785
This one looks green again.

14:14.785 --> 14:17.625
Maybe I don't drop this one.

14:17.625 --> 14:19.025
Dig deep, baby. You can do it.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.985
I'm sure a lot of people are
disappointed at the Roadblock.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.225
They could have seen
me in a swimsuit,

14:22.225 --> 14:23.305
but no, they had
to see Ashley.

14:23.305 --> 14:25.505
People will have to learn to live
with that disappointment, I guess.

14:25.505 --> 14:27.865
You got this,
Kor. You got this.

14:27.865 --> 14:29.825
Let's go, let's go. How you
feeling, babe? You did great.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.745
Come on. You did good, baby.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.665
Team Green! Team Green!

14:33.665 --> 14:35.985
That beach body!

14:35.985 --> 14:37.705
Yay!

14:37.705 --> 14:39.105
Legwork. -OK.

14:41.065 --> 14:43.265
Hola. Rapido, por favor.

14:43.265 --> 14:44.705
Going to Totumo.

14:45.745 --> 14:46.985
Andale, por favor. Andale.

14:46.985 --> 14:47.985
Big race.

14:49.385 --> 14:51.785
We just landed in Cartagena.
Waiting to get off.

14:51.785 --> 14:55.225
We really want to see another
team as fast as possible.

14:55.225 --> 14:58.945
Can you go a little faster, por
favor? Please, please, please.

14:58.945 --> 15:01.905
I've never known a
car to go this slow.

15:01.905 --> 15:04.425
Totumo? Conoces Totumo?

15:06.425 --> 15:08.705
Rapido, por favor.

15:08.705 --> 15:11.625
There's literally been
six cars just pass us.

15:11.625 --> 15:14.625
If it's far, everyone had
to drive that far, so...

15:14.625 --> 15:16.665
We're behind a
decent amount of time,

15:16.665 --> 15:18.545
but we don't think it's,
you know, insurmountable.

15:18.545 --> 15:21.945
Gosh, people are passing us.
Please hurry. Please, sir, please.

15:21.945 --> 15:24.305
Can we go faster?
We are racing.

15:24.305 --> 15:26.705
Pretty please. Oh,
my gosh. Seriously.

15:26.705 --> 15:28.705
Look, like that. That speed.
A moped just passed us.

15:28.705 --> 15:32.145
The way we do things, we're
bound to pass somebody, I think.

15:32.145 --> 15:36.385
And hopefully we see the whites
in their eyes as they cry in fear.

15:36.385 --> 15:37.385
(LAUGHS)

15:37.385 --> 15:39.705
Please can you... -Sir, please.

15:39.705 --> 15:42.364
..can you follow them?
Por favor, please.

15:43.340 --> 15:45.060
BOTH: "Who is a hot mess?"
-I'll do it. -'Cause you're hot mess.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.460
I'm always a hot mess!

15:46.460 --> 15:48.180
BOTH: Oh, my God!

15:48.180 --> 15:49.780
I'm going to get in
mud right now! (SCREAMS)

15:49.780 --> 15:51.100
This is so amazing.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.580
I don't have a
bathing suit. Daddy!

15:53.580 --> 15:59.340
Do you have anything I could wear
as a bathing suit that isn't a thong?

15:59.340 --> 16:01.100
No, honey. Wear something.

16:02.220 --> 16:03.820
Oh, my God. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.420
I love you so much.

16:05.420 --> 16:07.300
It's one thing to run out
into a mud bath in a thong,

16:07.300 --> 16:09.660
it's another thing when your
father is standing there.

16:09.660 --> 16:11.380
Yeah, I voted for the
sharing the underwear.

16:11.380 --> 16:13.420
This is awesome.
She's going to kill it.

16:13.420 --> 16:15.580
We have two other teams
behind us right now.

16:15.580 --> 16:19.740
Right now, we're headed to
Totumo. We're in last place.

16:19.740 --> 16:21.540
We're going to have
to get way smoother.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.820
Please, please,
please. We're racing.

16:23.820 --> 16:25.820
Please, sir. El race-o.

16:25.820 --> 16:28.540
Mom, 'el race-o'? How do
you say 'race' in Spanish?

16:29.740 --> 16:31.500
Right here, right here.

16:31.500 --> 16:32.620
Let's go, let's go. Get out.

16:32.620 --> 16:34.220
Aargh!

16:34.220 --> 16:35.860
Do you have a
clue for us, guys?

16:35.860 --> 16:38.020
Welcome to Cartagena.
-Gracias, senor. Gracias.

and Indigenous recipes.

are among the world's best.

Pop-Up. "Put up a
sunshade." Let's go.

Girl, we've got
this. Oh, my gosh!

17:25.660 --> 17:28.060
Is it cold? Here I go.

17:28.060 --> 17:29.740
How does it feel?

17:29.740 --> 17:31.900
Whoo! (SCREAMS)

Oh, my gosh. This is like
the best day spa ever! I know!

17:39.580 --> 17:40.940
OK. Is it this way?

17:40.940 --> 17:42.820
This way.
-Where's the clue?

17:42.820 --> 17:44.100
I think we're pretty
good at building stuff.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.340
We put tents together.
You want to build it?

17:45.340 --> 17:47.620
OK, we're going to do Pop-Up.
We're going to do Pop-Up.

17:47.620 --> 17:48.860
Let's just build.
Do you want to build?

17:48.860 --> 17:49.860
Let's build. -Pop-Up.

17:51.740 --> 17:54.060
Oh, yes! Whoo!
Gracias, Charlie.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.250
This looks like it right here.

18:10.250 --> 18:14.660
There was, essentially, half of
the tent already set up for us

18:14.660 --> 18:16.180
and we had to mimic
the other half.

18:16.180 --> 18:18.490
These are our stakes, this
is where the next stake is.

18:18.490 --> 18:21.300

to put a yellow stick in it.

It's got to be deep.

Do you want to? I
can. -I'll just do it.

It looks like this.

18:42.770 --> 18:44.300

do a video tutorial about it!

No, that's blue.

the little...crotch.

27:09.541 --> 27:10.981
And it was pretty traumatic.

27:10.981 --> 27:13.141
I don't eat fish, I don't
like playing with fish,

27:13.141 --> 27:14.821

Alright, let's move on here.

Don't give up. You can do it.

27:22.541 --> 27:23.661
Come on, Hagan.

27:26.581 --> 27:28.301
Come on, Hagan. You can do it.

27:28.301 --> 27:29.421
Come on.

27:35.461 --> 27:36.941
Ready? -Yup. -OK.

27:36.941 --> 27:39.861
After arriving last
in the previous leg,

27:39.861 --> 27:42.581
Scott and Blair must now
complete a Speed Bump.

27:42.581 --> 27:48.141
They must help these local fishermen
pull in this enormous fishing net,

27:48.141 --> 27:52.341
then grab the catch of the day
before they continue racing.

27:52.341 --> 27:53.341
Alright! Grab!

27:53.341 --> 27:54.661
That way? Go down. OK.

27:54.661 --> 27:56.741
Oh, my shoes are going to
get wet. Pull, pull, pull.

27:56.741 --> 27:58.061
Just like they're
doing. Watch them.

27:58.061 --> 28:00.701
Pull. Pull. Pull just even.

28:00.701 --> 28:02.341
Let's go. Come on, pull!

28:02.341 --> 28:03.861
I'm pulling, Dad.

28:04.861 --> 28:05.981
I might pass out.

28:05.981 --> 28:07.461
The water was
pulling on the net.

28:07.461 --> 28:10.541
You had to wait for the wave
to kind of help you and pull.

28:10.541 --> 28:12.781
Go, Daddy, go! Yeah!

28:12.781 --> 28:16.621
This is harder than CrossFit
and Pilates together!

28:16.621 --> 28:18.061
Hi, guys. Hola.

28:18.061 --> 28:19.221
Hi!

28:19.221 --> 28:20.621
BOTH: Thank you!

28:20.621 --> 28:22.741
I'll do whatever you want to
do. -I think we should grill.

28:22.741 --> 28:23.741
Alright, let's go.

28:23.741 --> 28:26.021
(MUSIC BLARES)
It's pretty crazy.

28:26.021 --> 28:27.661
I can't hear anything but...

28:28.661 --> 28:29.661
..it's pretty fun.

28:30.661 --> 28:33.101
Babe, we didn't have to do it
in front of a truck, did we?

28:33.101 --> 28:34.781
No. -Are you sure?

28:34.781 --> 28:37.221
I'm not sure but
I think we're fine.

28:37.221 --> 28:38.221
I hope so.

28:38.221 --> 28:40.261
Cole, Cole, look
at me. Look at me.

28:43.941 --> 28:47.381
Look, look, look. Side
stakes are sideways.

28:47.381 --> 28:49.061
This stake is the
wrong direction.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.661
This one? -All of them!

28:53.301 --> 28:56.821
All of these are facing the
wrong direction, every single one.

28:56.821 --> 28:58.421
Help me turn it,
help me turn it.

28:58.421 --> 29:01.501
I can't turn it. We
have to dig it out.

29:01.501 --> 29:02.501
Turn it, turn it, turn it.

29:02.501 --> 29:04.901
You can't turn it
like this! You can't!

29:04.901 --> 29:07.181
Yes. -No, you
can't! Listen to me.

29:07.181 --> 29:08.781
If I could get two hands
on it... -No, you can't!

29:08.781 --> 29:10.701
I have a little bit
of a fiery personality.

29:10.701 --> 29:12.461
I'm not a grey-area
kind of person.

29:12.461 --> 29:14.341
Babe, you're going to
knock me off the chair.

29:14.341 --> 29:16.141
Alright. -The
chair's going down!

29:16.141 --> 29:18.541
I'm really either
a one or a 10.

29:18.541 --> 29:21.221
And Matt, whether he's
on fire or taking a nap,

29:21.221 --> 29:23.941
his personality
is always a five.

wait! I'm so happy!

So, my fish are descaled.
I've got my three fish.

29:59.381 --> 30:03.741
OK, three fish. We
haven't washed our hands.

30:03.741 --> 30:06.021
I think I just
stepped on fish guts.

30:06.021 --> 30:08.421
OK, I'm going to slide
this guy in real easy.

30:08.421 --> 30:10.661

I'll be good to you.

Wow. It's so smoky.

30:14.581 --> 30:17.781
Get these flakes off.
-We have to cook three plates.

supposed to go here?

the stacked area."

stuff. -You start on the plates.

'cause it's so much smoke.

ahead of the other teams,

through the...

very tough competition.

leg, but Tyler and Korey,

trick to finding this clue?

have the clue, right?

Did you go to the other
place? -It said come here.

It was the...the blue one.

Oh, no, you have to go somewhere
else in that town over here.

here 'cause it's falling apart.

though. -That's my concern.

to do another fish

one's head came off.

some fish scales for lunch?

36:05.739 --> 36:07.499
"Make your way to
the next Pit Stop."

36:07.499 --> 36:10.619
(BOTH SCREAM)

36:10.619 --> 36:11.939
We love you!

36:11.939 --> 36:13.659
Babe, we have to hurry.
People are finishing.

36:13.659 --> 36:14.699
Yep, yep, yep.

36:14.699 --> 36:15.699
Kind of nerve-racking

36:15.699 --> 36:17.419
'cause I see all these
other teams getting their...

36:17.419 --> 36:20.099
..things but, oh, well,
let's see if we can get it.

36:20.099 --> 36:21.849
It's far, Mom.

36:21.849 --> 36:24.849
Good Lord. Why
did we not drive?

36:24.849 --> 36:26.179
I hear music.

36:26.179 --> 36:27.979
I thought it was,
like, down the road.

36:27.979 --> 36:28.979
Me too.

36:28.979 --> 36:30.779
All their fricking
cabs are over here, Mom.

36:30.779 --> 36:32.939
Pink team just got here,
last team just got here, Dad.

36:32.939 --> 36:34.419
We just beat them
in the last challenge

36:34.419 --> 36:37.739
when they were there before us, so
this should be a similar process.

36:37.739 --> 36:39.659
We're hoping we can catch
up. I mean, this is...

36:40.889 --> 36:42.179
..a little more up our alley.

36:43.459 --> 36:45.419
(BOTH SCREAM)

36:47.019 --> 36:48.139
Let's go!

36:50.419 --> 36:52.779
Ah! Aargh!

36:52.779 --> 36:55.259
Blair, are you happy with
everything but the fish?

36:55.259 --> 36:58.019
Yeah. This is the
best one yet, Blair.

36:58.019 --> 36:59.779
I finally figured
out how to cook them.

36:59.779 --> 37:02.459
Good, Daddy. Good, Daddy.

37:02.459 --> 37:04.329
Si?

37:04.329 --> 37:06.819
Por favor! Por favor!
-Please, please, please!

37:07.819 --> 37:09.259
(SCREAMS) Oh, my gosh!

37:09.259 --> 37:10.739
Oh, we love you!

37:10.739 --> 37:13.539
We have to deliver the
plates to table four.

37:13.539 --> 37:14.939
Aargh! Ah.

37:16.459 --> 37:18.299
Huh? -It's falling apart.

37:18.299 --> 37:19.849
Whoo! -Smoke is tough.

37:19.849 --> 37:22.259
Come on, we got to go, we got
to go. We got to get there.

37:22.259 --> 37:24.419
Alright, Blair, we're
still in it so far.

37:24.419 --> 37:26.219
If we can just get
to the Pit Stop.

37:26.219 --> 37:27.259
Quick, quick!

37:28.699 --> 37:31.419
We should have brought our taxi.
We did not do that, unfortunately.

37:31.419 --> 37:32.419
We ran. -We ran.

37:33.419 --> 37:35.139
Looking good. -It's burnt.

37:35.139 --> 37:37.459
That one's burnt. Whoo!

37:45.109 --> 37:47.469
Fish has got to finish
up, Rice got to finish up,

37:47.469 --> 37:49.869
plantain's got to
roast a little bit more.

37:49.869 --> 37:51.789
I don't see any other
teams here right now.

37:51.789 --> 37:54.109
I see one more cab,
I think it's for...

37:54.109 --> 37:56.789
..Cam and Darius and our cab isn't
even here, so that's going to suck.

37:56.789 --> 37:58.029
Ah!

37:58.029 --> 37:59.789
Oops. Agh!

37:59.789 --> 38:03.259
Let's go, Momma. We're not behind.
Let's go. We're right there.

38:04.699 --> 38:07.629
(SCREAM AND CHEER) Hi!

38:09.389 --> 38:12.989
Oh, look! Oh, my
gosh! Oh, my gosh.

38:15.219 --> 38:18.219
That was insane! You came in
on top of each other there.

38:18.219 --> 38:19.469
Number seven again!

38:19.469 --> 38:21.219
Look at the fish I took out
and see if you think it's OK.

38:21.219 --> 38:23.739
Looks good, Mom.
I'll do the rice, OK?

38:24.739 --> 38:25.869
Yes!

38:25.869 --> 38:27.389
That looks terrible.

38:28.629 --> 38:30.949
You might want to start on
another fish just in case.

38:30.949 --> 38:32.909
Start on another fish.
Got to get it right.

38:33.909 --> 38:36.259
(IMITATES CAR)

38:37.349 --> 38:38.349
Very good.

38:38.349 --> 38:40.739
Does it make you feel good to
have got through two legs, Sheri?

38:40.739 --> 38:42.629
Yes. It feels good.

38:42.629 --> 38:44.829
As long as we're staying in.
-We'll just keep going.

38:44.829 --> 38:46.189
We didn't want to
move our way up.

38:46.189 --> 38:48.429
Good job, Mom. Come
on. We're doing great.

38:49.629 --> 38:51.109
Momma. -What? We're done.

38:51.109 --> 38:53.869
It looks like they just
finished and got the judge over.

38:53.869 --> 38:54.869
Ow!

38:54.869 --> 38:57.259
Please, please,
please. Please.

38:57.259 --> 38:58.509
Please. Por favor.

38:59.509 --> 39:02.429
(SCREAMS) Gracias!

39:02.429 --> 39:05.109
Thank you, thank you,
thank you. Thank you!

39:05.109 --> 39:06.739
Hagan and Marty
just finished theirs

39:06.739 --> 39:09.429
and I think they were the last
team to complete the challenge.

39:09.429 --> 39:10.429
Find the way to go.

39:10.429 --> 39:12.309
I'm trying. All our
stuff is in there.

39:12.309 --> 39:14.029
Oh, God. There's no
time to spare, Momma.

39:14.029 --> 39:15.029
OK.

39:15.029 --> 39:16.739
Daddy, come on!

39:16.739 --> 39:19.219
Hi! Hi! Hi!

39:19.219 --> 39:20.989
Scott and Blair, I
am pleased to tell you

39:20.989 --> 39:23.219
that you are team
number nine and you...

39:23.219 --> 39:26.189
(SCREAMS) Whoo-hoo!

39:26.189 --> 39:28.509
Good job, Daddy. I love you.

39:28.509 --> 39:30.349
Congratulations.
Way to come back!

39:30.349 --> 39:32.789
You did it, Daddy. Yeah!

39:32.789 --> 39:34.389
We got to get out of here.

39:34.389 --> 39:36.699
Check on the plantains.
They're too brown.

39:36.699 --> 39:38.309
That oil is just super hot,

39:38.309 --> 39:39.589
so if we just put
another one in there,

39:39.589 --> 39:40.789
it shouldn't take
that much time.

39:46.069 --> 39:48.989
Our cab is probably another...

39:48.989 --> 39:50.349
..half a mile away. -Mile.

39:50.349 --> 39:51.589
Hagan, how far? -Mile.

39:51.589 --> 39:54.069
That's a lot better.
This might be it.

39:54.069 --> 39:56.029
Think I got the
right cook time.

39:57.189 --> 39:58.189
Oh, yes. Here we go!

39:58.189 --> 39:59.629
We're almost there.

39:59.629 --> 40:02.469
Why did we not drive? -It's OK.

40:02.469 --> 40:04.829
Alright, call her
over, call her over.

40:11.029 --> 40:12.829
Oh. Gracias! -Oh, OK!

40:12.829 --> 40:13.829
Right, let's go.

40:13.829 --> 40:16.109
Oh, God. We're getting there.

40:16.109 --> 40:18.349
No. I'm not losing this race.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.149
Let's go!

40:20.149 --> 40:22.069
Mas rapido, por favor.

40:23.389 --> 40:25.789
Let's go. It's not over
yet till he says it's over.

40:26.909 --> 40:28.829
We've got to be
faster than them, man.

40:28.829 --> 40:31.309
Oh, snap. No! Oh, snap!

40:31.309 --> 40:33.469
That is nuts, dude! What?

40:33.469 --> 40:34.509
Hagan and Marty

40:34.509 --> 40:36.629
are running down this
road. To their taxi.

40:36.629 --> 40:39.069
I'm guessing they have to run
all the way to the juice stand.

40:39.069 --> 40:41.149
Yeah, I guess they left their
taxi all the way over here.

40:41.149 --> 40:42.699
Well, I wasn't expecting that.

40:42.699 --> 40:44.699
You never know. You never
know what can happen.

40:45.869 --> 40:48.469
That's it. That's it, Mom.

40:48.469 --> 40:50.669
That mistake just
cost us the race.

40:50.669 --> 40:52.739
Nightmare. I know.

40:52.739 --> 40:54.629
And that's why it's
important to not give up...

40:54.629 --> 40:56.509
(LAUGHS) ..when a team leaves.

40:56.509 --> 40:58.389
We're idiots. -Yeah.

40:58.389 --> 40:59.389
Pretty much.

41:02.029 --> 41:03.069
There he is!

41:06.669 --> 41:07.699
Phew.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.429
Darius and Cameron,
you're still in the race.

41:10.429 --> 41:11.869
Whoo! -You are team number ten.

41:11.869 --> 41:13.989
Oh, man! -Let's go, man.

41:13.989 --> 41:15.739
God!

41:15.739 --> 41:18.699
Has this been humbling so far?
You guys are very book-smart.

41:18.699 --> 41:20.949
Book-smart doesn't help
with international flights.

41:20.949 --> 41:23.829
Every leg we learn something
new, we take something from it,

41:23.829 --> 41:25.549
figure out what
we need to fix.

41:25.549 --> 41:26.789
We made a lot of
mistakes this leg.

41:26.789 --> 41:29.389
We underestimated the competitive
attitudes of the other teams.

41:29.389 --> 41:31.549
If what happened
today happens again,

41:31.549 --> 41:33.189
we won't play it the same way.

41:35.189 --> 41:37.109
(WHIMPERS)

41:38.189 --> 41:42.029
Marty and Hagan, I'm sorry to
tell you you are in last place

41:42.029 --> 41:43.789
and you have been
eliminated from the race.

41:45.069 --> 41:46.699
It's horrible. -We're so sad.

41:47.699 --> 41:50.669
Hagan, you were so invested
in being in this race.

41:50.669 --> 41:52.989
I had a lot left in me
to give to this race.

41:52.989 --> 41:55.069
I wasn't ready to give up yet.

41:55.069 --> 41:57.469
I'm just so proud of her. She
couldn't have done any better.

41:57.469 --> 41:59.549
I'm so proud of the
woman that she is

41:59.549 --> 42:02.219
and I just love her
with all my heart.

42:02.219 --> 42:03.549
My baby girl.

42:03.549 --> 42:05.349
I wanted to do the
race with my daughter

42:05.349 --> 42:07.469
because she's just
graduated from college,

42:07.469 --> 42:10.109
and so this is kind of one of
our last mother-daughter things

42:10.109 --> 42:11.589
we're going to get
to do for a while.

42:11.589 --> 42:14.539
There's nobody I would have wanted
to do the race with other than her.
