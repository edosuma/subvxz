WEBVTT

00:04.875 --> 00:06.542
There's something about the building.

00:06.543 --> 00:09.303
[Eerie whispering]

00:10.376 --> 00:16.276
Working at the Capitol Theatre, it
did leave you with an eerie feeling.

00:16.369 --> 00:21.709
I'm not easily scared,
but it's a feeling of evil.

00:24.141 --> 00:29.394
It's mine to make sure it's
secure, but I don't feel secure.

00:29.395 --> 00:30.408
Wham.

00:30.409 --> 00:33.654
There is something
definitely messing with me.

00:33.655 --> 00:36.175
[Demonic roar]

00:36.416 --> 00:38.182
I know what I saw.

00:38.183 --> 00:41.395
It sure as heck wasn't
in the job description.

00:41.396 --> 00:44.996
There's something behind you.

00:50.385 --> 00:53.025
[Haunting music]

01:10.821 --> 01:13.648
I've always to, you know,
work in law enforcement.

01:13.649 --> 01:19.549
It's kind of a cliche thing, but I
wanted to do it ever since I was a child.

01:19.667 --> 01:22.511
My job as a protective service officer

01:22.512 --> 01:27.192
is to watch over numerous
County facilities,

01:28.119 --> 01:31.789
and my first assignment
was the Capitol Theatre.

01:31.790 --> 01:34.756
It's been around for a long
time, the Capitol Theatre.

01:34.757 --> 01:38.957
It's a part of Salt Lake's history.

01:42.967 --> 01:45.967
Thanks for the ride.

01:54.712 --> 01:56.112
Come on in.

01:56.113 --> 01:58.567
I met officer Mathews.

01:58.568 --> 02:01.385
He was assigned to me
about a week, two weeks,

02:01.386 --> 02:07.286
depending how long it took an individual
to get accustomed to the building.

02:20.138 --> 02:21.805
He flipped the lights on.

02:21.806 --> 02:27.243
Then you truly get to see the theater,
and it's just absolutely gorgeous.

02:27.244 --> 02:29.764
It's amazing.

02:30.738 --> 02:33.482
When officer Murphy first
arrived, he was nervous.

02:33.483 --> 02:36.352
He was apprehensive, because
it was a new job for him,

02:36.353 --> 02:40.642
but he was eager to learn,
so we jumped right into it.

02:40.643 --> 02:44.093
There are surveillance cameras
throughout the facility.

02:44.094 --> 02:46.362
You can pull up anything
you want, all right?

02:46.363 --> 02:48.364
So you got your center stage.

02:48.365 --> 02:50.951
Next one.. Catacomb.

02:50.952 --> 02:53.122
- Front door, important.
- Okay.

02:53.123 --> 02:55.492
So you literally could
sit in the control room

02:55.493 --> 03:00.315
and monitor just about
anywhere in the building.

03:00.316 --> 03:04.456
- Ready for a tour?
- Let's do it.

03:04.680 --> 03:08.394
I felt officer Mathews didn't
want to say a whole lot to me

03:08.395 --> 03:11.455
except for my duties.

03:16.191 --> 03:22.091
Now, the first time when you come
on shift, you lock everything down.

03:24.767 --> 03:28.704
There are a lot of nooks and
crannies that anybody can be in,

03:28.705 --> 03:30.573
and so you want to make
sure that you check them out

03:30.574 --> 03:35.194
to make sure that
there's nobody in there.

03:48.658 --> 03:53.038
Bet you can't wait to be on your own.

03:56.599 --> 04:02.304
I took him down into the basement,
which is what we call the catacombs.

04:02.305 --> 04:04.139
The basement is massive.

04:04.140 --> 04:07.009
Security lights. See these lights here?

04:07.010 --> 04:08.643
There's a lot of rooms..

04:08.644 --> 04:10.345
Dressing rooms, locker rooms.

04:10.346 --> 04:13.047
There's maintenance, the wood shop.

04:13.048 --> 04:14.482
These are important.

04:14.483 --> 04:17.051
So you would just go through,
and you would test every doorknob

04:17.052 --> 04:19.952
to make sure that they were locked.

04:19.954 --> 04:25.854
And then you would work your
way up into the different levels.

04:29.064 --> 04:30.531
That's about it.

04:30.532 --> 04:32.378
That's everything?

04:32.379 --> 04:36.171
He was quiet. He was very quiet.

04:36.172 --> 04:38.512
That's it.

04:39.058 --> 04:44.038
I just felt that he was
holding something back.

04:57.228 --> 04:59.228
Finally I decided.. I
came to work one night.

04:59.229 --> 05:01.862
I thought, "I can do
this on my own". It's..

05:01.863 --> 05:04.563
It's not hard".

05:08.757 --> 05:11.567
I had the building down.
I knew what had to be done.

05:11.568 --> 05:14.748
I've got it down pat.

05:25.289 --> 05:31.189
So as I come up the west stairwell,
now I'm on the third floor.

05:32.921 --> 05:37.301
And the building's all but locked down.

06:03.329 --> 06:06.029
[Eerie crackling]

06:15.041 --> 06:18.101
[Indistinct whispering]

06:20.914 --> 06:21.981
[Walkie-talkie clicks off]

06:21.982 --> 06:25.042
[Indistinct whispering]

06:27.555 --> 06:33.455
I make my way down, and this is
where the rehearsal rooms are.

06:38.498 --> 06:44.398
I stick my head in quickly just
to make sure there's nobody there.

06:45.740 --> 06:48.244
Everything was good.

06:48.245 --> 06:50.645
[Door slams]

06:52.381 --> 06:55.283
Door slams behind me.

06:55.284 --> 06:57.218
I mean, with incredible force, it just..

06:57.219 --> 06:59.259
[Claps]

07:01.461 --> 07:07.361
I'm looking to see if somebody ran down
the hall, if they ran and hit the exit.

07:11.769 --> 07:15.805
Officer Murphy called me, and he says,
"somebody just slammed a door up here".

07:15.806 --> 07:17.473
Can you check the cameras? Over.

07:17.474 --> 07:20.714
Copy that, checking now.

07:25.048 --> 07:26.949
- I don't see anything.
- Okay.

07:26.950 --> 07:29.650
I'm coming now.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.925
I'm thinking logically..

07:35.926 --> 07:37.627
"You can't slam the door.

07:37.628 --> 07:41.465
There's a hydraulic hinge on the top".

07:41.466 --> 07:46.180
So I start to remove my gun, and
I got it in the ready position.

07:46.181 --> 07:48.401
[Clicking]

07:50.775 --> 07:56.295
I get this strong impression
somebody's waiting for me.

07:56.547 --> 08:00.051
There is an individual in there.

08:00.052 --> 08:03.232
My adrenaline kicks in.

08:03.656 --> 08:04.956
It's my duty. I'm an officer.

08:04.957 --> 08:08.017
I'm gonna make sure.

08:18.371 --> 08:21.368
I remember running as fast as I could

08:21.369 --> 08:25.141
through the theater
to get to where he was.

08:25.142 --> 08:28.579
And you got to understand, when somebody
says, "there's somebody in here,"

08:28.580 --> 08:31.700
you believe them 110%.

08:34.989 --> 08:37.328
I walk in.

08:45.934 --> 08:48.574
[Water dripping]

08:54.097 --> 08:59.257
I just get.. This sickening
feeling comes over me.

09:00.982 --> 09:05.542
And as soon as I come
around the corner..

09:06.455 --> 09:09.575
I've got goose bumps.

09:25.140 --> 09:29.760
And this.. This cold
goes right through me.

09:32.213 --> 09:33.313
I'm freezing to death.

09:33.314 --> 09:35.954
[Water dripping]

09:38.719 --> 09:42.605
Sheriff's Department. Come out now.

09:42.606 --> 09:45.906
It's a feeling of evil.

10:02.759 --> 10:05.399
[Water dripping]

10:20.225 --> 10:23.964
I can see the sink, I see the
men's urinal, and I see the stalls.

10:23.965 --> 10:26.700
And I look underneath the
stalls, and there's no feet there.

10:26.701 --> 10:29.237
There's.. So I'm thinking
maybe they're on..

10:29.238 --> 10:33.618
Standing on the toilets, trying to hide.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.720
Nobody's there.

10:41.416 --> 10:44.452
And that's when I turn, and
I look at officer Murphy,

10:44.453 --> 10:50.058
and he's got this look of, like, "oh,
boy, I messed this one up big-time".

10:50.059 --> 10:52.335
Nothing here, dude.

10:52.336 --> 10:58.236
I'm not easily intimidated, but the
feeling I had in the restroom was..

10:58.820 --> 11:01.940
I was.. I was scared.

11:02.203 --> 11:05.673
All right, better do a full
sweep, see if anyone's hiding out.

11:05.674 --> 11:06.841
- All right?
- Okay.

11:06.842 --> 11:11.053
We decide, "okay, if there's somebody
in this building, we need to find 'em".

11:11.054 --> 11:14.534
We go to the second floor.

11:33.469 --> 11:36.705
I'm standing there in
amazement, and I'm shocked.

11:36.706 --> 11:39.475
I mean, I had just
turned those lights off.

11:39.476 --> 11:43.156
I mean, I'd just locked those
doors. I secured that floor.

11:43.157 --> 11:46.250
Every light is on, and doors are open.

11:46.251 --> 11:49.551
I just locked this door.

11:49.854 --> 11:54.114
- Did you come up here earlier?
- No.

12:01.533 --> 12:05.836
I turned the lights off, I locked
the door, and I went down the stairs.

12:05.837 --> 12:08.897
I know I secured it.

12:10.125 --> 12:14.079
It was kind of cold between,
I felt, Mathews and I

12:14.080 --> 12:17.740
the remainder of that evening.

12:18.791 --> 12:20.940
I don't want to say I was
holding something back, but

12:20.941 --> 12:23.581
there had been some unusual
things that had happened to me

12:23.582 --> 12:29.482
while working in the theater, and I
just couldn't come out and tell him.

12:30.135 --> 12:35.715
I needed to keep my credibility
as his training officer.

12:40.577 --> 12:44.237
[Whispering] Help me. Help me.

12:44.445 --> 12:48.249
I was sitting at my desk in the Security
room when I start to hear voices.

12:48.250 --> 12:51.910
[Voices whispering indistinctly]

12:52.696 --> 12:56.557
And when I'm talking voices, I'm not
talking about how I'm talking right now,

12:56.558 --> 12:59.293
but these are conversations
that are going on behind me..

12:59.294 --> 13:02.954
[Voices whispering indistinctly]

13:09.004 --> 13:10.170
[Imitates whispering]

13:10.171 --> 13:12.906
Like somebody's having a conversation
and they want to keep it private.

13:12.907 --> 13:16.567
[Voices whispering indistinctly]

13:19.314 --> 13:22.314
When I turn around..

13:24.060 --> 13:27.120
There's nobody there.

13:28.557 --> 13:32.085
[Voices whispering indistinctly]

13:32.086 --> 13:37.056
At this point, the hairs on the back
of my neck are starting to prick up.

13:37.057 --> 13:39.500
[Whispering] Now get.. Get out.

13:39.501 --> 13:41.235
[Coughing]

13:41.236 --> 13:42.536
My heart's going.

13:42.537 --> 13:44.638
[Whispering] Help.

13:44.639 --> 13:47.007
And I'm thinking, "something
really is messing with me"..

13:47.008 --> 13:48.843
I can't breathe.

13:48.844 --> 13:51.964
"Something or someone".

13:52.214 --> 13:54.215
I know I'm not crazy.

13:54.216 --> 13:57.876
[Voices whispering indistinctly]

14:00.290 --> 14:02.358
Get out. Get out of here.

14:02.359 --> 14:04.411
Get out of here. Get out.

14:04.412 --> 14:07.172
Get out of here.

14:09.155 --> 14:13.008
I went into the basement, where
all the dressing rooms are..

14:13.009 --> 14:15.289
No voices.

14:18.075 --> 14:21.255
It's almost cave-like.

14:22.433 --> 14:26.682
There was no windows.
There was no street access.

14:26.683 --> 14:29.323
You're trapped.

14:29.886 --> 14:32.822
And I smell something.

14:32.823 --> 14:36.903
And I recognize what that smell is.

14:37.093 --> 14:39.673
I smell smoke.

14:47.504 --> 14:49.773
That smoke smell is so constant,

14:49.774 --> 14:54.336
the theater would've had
to burn down multiple times.

14:54.337 --> 14:57.577
But I'm 100% positive..

14:58.058 --> 15:01.478
There is nothing going on.

15:03.555 --> 15:09.071
Something that's messing with you,
that's playing mind tricks on you,

15:09.072 --> 15:13.692
you really begin to
question your own self.

15:25.877 --> 15:27.911
I had come on duty one night.

15:27.912 --> 15:32.854
It was.. It was later in the afternoon,
so maybe 4:00, 5:00-ish, thereabouts,

15:32.855 --> 15:35.028
and I do my routine.

15:35.029 --> 15:36.975
- And there's a man..
- That's interesting.

15:36.976 --> 15:40.624
Standing at the end of the
hall talking to two women.

15:40.625 --> 15:44.027
So I'm in the corridor, and
I'm listening to the women

15:44.028 --> 15:46.129
tell this gentleman a story.

15:46.130 --> 15:49.065
Well, these ghost stories and hauntings,

15:49.066 --> 15:51.667
they've been going on
for many, many years.

15:51.668 --> 15:53.903
And I hear the word "ghost".

15:53.904 --> 15:55.605
That's got my attention now.

15:55.606 --> 15:56.563
Excuse me, Sir?

15:56.564 --> 15:58.394
You know, I introduce myself to him.

15:58.395 --> 16:01.310
Dave Murphy. I'm the new
deputy here at the theater.

16:01.311 --> 16:04.467
He says, "I'm Blair Fuller.
I'm the senior accountant".

16:04.468 --> 16:07.415
Would you mind if I
asked you a few questions?

16:07.416 --> 16:09.252
Sure. Why don't you step into my office?

16:09.253 --> 16:10.358
That'd be great. Thank you.

16:10.359 --> 16:14.513
He was very curious after having heard
that I'd had some experiences there.

16:14.514 --> 16:15.725
Have a seat right here.

16:15.726 --> 16:18.328
So I began to share
with him the story that

16:18.329 --> 16:21.051
happened to me as I was
there working late at night.

16:21.052 --> 16:26.692
I tend to get a lot more
things done when I work late.

16:27.805 --> 16:33.445
So I'm working at about
9:00 or 10:00 in the evening.

16:43.921 --> 16:48.458
Just outside of our main
office is an elevator.

16:48.459 --> 16:52.763
When the motor kicks on for
that, it's a very loud noise.

16:52.764 --> 16:56.484
[Motor whirring, elevator dings]

16:59.904 --> 17:02.544
[Elevator dings]

17:03.308 --> 17:05.463
I'm there in the building
alone, so I was very

17:05.464 --> 17:09.386
surprised to hear the
elevator moving at night.

17:09.387 --> 17:11.782
[Elevator dings]

17:11.784 --> 17:15.503
The elevator reached our floor.

17:16.489 --> 17:19.128
[Elevator dings]

17:32.577 --> 17:35.217
[Elevator dings]

17:49.915 --> 17:52.435
[Loud buzzing]

17:54.327 --> 18:00.227
It takes 30 to 40 seconds for an alarm to
go off if the door stays open that long.

18:02.168 --> 18:05.394
I walked out to the elevator
to see what was going on.

18:05.395 --> 18:08.575
[Elevator alarm buzzing]

18:18.586 --> 18:19.869
I thought, "that's really odd".

18:19.870 --> 18:22.327
There's nothing blocking the door

18:22.328 --> 18:25.228
I thought that it was
most likely a malfunction.

18:25.229 --> 18:29.913
So I got on the elevator, and just
as I'm about to leave the elevator..

18:29.914 --> 18:31.131
[Elevator dings]

18:31.132 --> 18:34.672
The basement button has lit.

18:42.439 --> 18:46.509
We're going down now three floors from
where my office is to the basement.

18:46.510 --> 18:48.944
[Elevator dings]

18:48.945 --> 18:50.540
And this whole time, my mind is running.

18:50.541 --> 18:52.262
"What is going on with this elevator?

18:52.263 --> 18:53.584
Why is it moving?"

18:53.585 --> 18:56.225
[Elevator dings]

[Elevator dings]

19:03.860 --> 19:06.500
[Elevator dings]

19:06.563 --> 19:09.803
We get to the basement.

19:10.708 --> 19:13.348
The doors open.

19:22.144 --> 19:25.864
There's nobody in the hallway.

19:26.414 --> 19:28.394
Hello!

19:31.953 --> 19:35.013
[Indistinct whispering]

19:42.118 --> 19:44.098
Hello!

19:51.705 --> 19:54.405
Is anyone there?

20:05.353 --> 20:07.953
There was nobody that I
could see, and I was very

20:07.954 --> 20:12.814
alone and very nervous
at that point in time.

20:18.366 --> 20:21.006
[Motor whirring]

20:24.973 --> 20:27.541
[Whispering] Help.

20:27.542 --> 20:29.762
[Coughing]

20:31.512 --> 20:37.284
I went back and sat down at my
desk, and then it even gets stranger.

20:37.285 --> 20:40.105
[Metallic scraping]

20:46.761 --> 20:49.581
[Metallic clanging]

20:54.101 --> 20:57.041
Clang, clang, clang.

20:57.771 --> 21:02.041
Clang, clang, clang,
clang, clang, clang, clang.

21:02.042 --> 21:04.101
I was very, very scared.

21:04.102 --> 21:08.653
I tried to find every way I could
to disprove what was going on..

21:08.654 --> 21:11.488
What my eyes and my
senses were telling me..

21:11.489 --> 21:14.669
And I couldn't do it.

21:14.818 --> 21:17.135
If there's anything
else you want to ask..

21:17.136 --> 21:19.002
From what I'm hearing from Blair,

21:19.003 --> 21:23.908
I felt that somebody else
has similar experiences to me.

21:23.909 --> 21:26.778
I'm not going crazy. Because
that's one of the things I felt..

21:26.779 --> 21:29.659
I was going crazy.

21:38.228 --> 21:42.483
We're getting towards the
end of my training period,

21:42.484 --> 21:48.384
and we're on the second tier of
the auditorium, the seating area.

21:48.679 --> 21:50.719
Morgan?

21:51.504 --> 21:52.869
What's up?

21:52.870 --> 21:57.638
I said, "do you ever get the feeling
you're being watched in this place?"

21:57.639 --> 21:59.645
What do you mean?

21:59.646 --> 22:04.806
Since I've started here,
I've heard weird noises.

22:05.216 --> 22:07.382
Doors have slammed on me.

22:07.383 --> 22:10.886
Lights are on in places
where you know there's nobody.

22:10.887 --> 22:13.988
I just have this..
Just a feeling of dread.

22:13.989 --> 22:17.612
That's kind of when he
starts to open up to me.

22:17.613 --> 22:20.128
And the voices..

22:20.129 --> 22:23.932
And we just started having
conversations about my experiences there.

22:23.933 --> 22:25.266
What he's been hearing..

22:25.267 --> 22:26.968
How long has this been happening to you?

22:26.969 --> 22:28.370
Since day one.

22:28.371 --> 22:30.005
What he's been feeling..

22:30.006 --> 22:31.606
And I think I'm right there..

22:31.607 --> 22:32.900
Gone.

22:32.901 --> 22:38.801
Once he opened up to me and we
started exchanging stories, um..

22:39.482 --> 22:41.455
My good friend Greg came to mind.

22:41.456 --> 22:44.287
And he's got a gift.

22:44.288 --> 22:46.928
An ability to..

22:47.131 --> 22:48.832
See things.

22:48.833 --> 22:52.926
Officer Murphy wanted to bring
him in and see what he could find.

22:52.927 --> 22:54.994
- Greg.
- Dave.

22:54.995 --> 22:56.189
Nice to see you.

22:56.190 --> 22:59.199
And I was like, "let's
do it. I'm all for it".

22:59.200 --> 23:00.634
This is my boss, Morgan.

23:00.635 --> 23:02.333
- Morgan, how are you?
- Good to meet you.

23:02.334 --> 23:06.540
I had known officer Murphy
for probably 15 years.

23:06.541 --> 23:09.711
Uh, shortly after he began
working at the Capitol Theatre,

23:09.712 --> 23:11.046
I received a call from him.

23:11.047 --> 23:13.215
- Give you the grand tour?
- Let's go.

23:13.216 --> 23:17.053
And he invited me to come over.

23:17.054 --> 23:20.064
I didn't tell him anything.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.475
I didn't tell him about
our experiences, nothing.

23:23.476 --> 23:26.236
He came in cold.

24:30.728 --> 24:35.737
Looking around, I noted that there
are many people standing there.

24:35.738 --> 24:38.973
So I'm playing stupid. I'm
like, "what do you mean, Greg?"

24:38.974 --> 24:42.454
The officers were oblivious.

24:45.247 --> 24:51.147
He said, "you didn't tell me this place
was haunted, and they're not good".

24:51.682 --> 24:54.512
And from that point on, I
was watching and listening

24:54.513 --> 25:00.413
to see if the things that I was going
through could be validated through him.

25:03.166 --> 25:07.272
There are stairs that lead down underneath
the stage into the dressing area,

25:07.273 --> 25:10.917
into the actors' dressing rooms.

25:10.918 --> 25:13.678
So we went down.

25:16.413 --> 25:20.417
So we're looking down the hallway..

25:20.418 --> 25:24.858
And we notice one of the doors is open.

25:25.323 --> 25:29.643
And it's open, you know, a good foot.

25:36.411 --> 25:37.423
[Door slams]

25:37.424 --> 25:40.146
Wham, that door shut
so hard and so fast.

25:40.147 --> 25:44.173
Mathews turns to me, and he's got
that "holy crap" look on his face.

25:44.174 --> 25:49.214
Both officer Murphy and
I reach for our weapons.

25:49.312 --> 25:52.132
- Cover?
- Gotcha.

26:00.189 --> 26:01.989
[Door handle rattling]

26:01.990 --> 26:03.658
The door handle started rattling.

26:03.659 --> 26:05.126
[Door handle rattling]

26:05.127 --> 26:10.767
Three of us are seeing, hearing
something physical happen.

26:20.845 --> 26:25.624
Doors slams, and then all of a sudden,
this door is shaking like crazy.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.751
You check the room out.
There's nothing there.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.442
I mean, how do you explain it?

26:30.443 --> 26:33.383
It's.. It's weird.

26:33.457 --> 26:37.994
They were both very, very
rattled at that point.

26:37.995 --> 26:40.728
Both officers were very, very rattled.

26:40.729 --> 26:43.099
You see now? Do you see? Do you see?

26:43.100 --> 26:44.534
It's been happening every night.

26:44.535 --> 26:49.171
How can you talk about your feelings
other than just like.. [Exhales]

26:49.172 --> 26:54.512
"Whoa, you know, this is
really happening right now"?

26:56.280 --> 26:59.640
We started down the hall.

27:00.885 --> 27:04.454
And as we proceeded
forward, it got warmer.

27:04.455 --> 27:09.426
Greg is hitting a hot spot where I
know that there's something there,

27:09.427 --> 27:13.627
because I can always smell the smoke.

27:15.299 --> 27:21.199
I said to Dave and officer Mathews,
"has there been a fire in this building?"

27:21.614 --> 27:23.298
And they said, "why do you ask?"

27:23.299 --> 27:27.199
And I said, "I can smell smoke".

27:34.485 --> 27:36.895
Greg, you all right?

27:36.896 --> 27:39.389
Shine the light in this corner for me.

27:39.390 --> 27:42.330
I saw a young man.

27:43.862 --> 27:46.762
I don't see anything.

27:46.763 --> 27:49.533
It's right there.

27:49.534 --> 27:51.539
I don't see anything.

27:51.540 --> 27:52.834
It's dark.

27:52.835 --> 27:55.872
We're the only three people
in the basement at that time.

27:55.873 --> 28:00.013
There is nobody else in the theater.

28:02.393 --> 28:05.792
Both officer Murphy and I just
kind of looked at each other.

28:05.793 --> 28:07.953
[Exhales]

28:09.987 --> 28:11.439
It was unbelievable.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.556
I mean, everything that he had told us,

28:13.557 --> 28:15.825
everything that had
happened to us previously

28:15.826 --> 28:20.630
and had happened to us that
night.. You know, it was validation.

28:20.631 --> 28:25.911
But it sure as heck wasn't
in the job description.

28:31.943 --> 28:37.454
You know, after Greg had left, things
just kind of got more and more crazy.

28:37.455 --> 28:40.639
The thing that really pushed
it over the edge for me

28:40.640 --> 28:45.089
was that the County had just installed
a brand-new camera.. Security Camera.

28:45.090 --> 28:47.631
It was an infrared camera,
so when the lights were off,

28:47.632 --> 28:53.092
you could actually see what
was going on in the dark.

28:55.335 --> 28:57.136
As I'm sitting there,

28:57.137 --> 29:03.037
I notice that there is something
sitting in one of the rows.

29:07.184 --> 29:11.824
I maximize that screen so it's
full screen on the computer monitor,

29:11.825 --> 29:13.478
and there's a figure.

29:13.479 --> 29:17.619
It looks like he's enjoying a show.

29:21.428 --> 29:24.908
And then all of a sudden..

29:26.217 --> 29:27.866
[Demonic roar]

29:27.867 --> 29:31.094
He just shoots across the sky.

29:31.095 --> 29:32.838
He's going.. [Roars]

29:32.839 --> 29:35.959
As he's going across.

29:36.828 --> 29:40.213
And that.. That scared me.

29:40.214 --> 29:45.914
And from that point on, I
would not work in the theater,

29:46.749 --> 29:52.649
because if there's something that is that
demonic, I don't want to be around it.

29:56.247 --> 30:02.147
Well, you always feel comfortable if
you have a partner, if you have a backup.

30:03.971 --> 30:06.973
There's nobody now to back me up.

30:06.974 --> 30:09.614
I'm alone now.

30:10.110 --> 30:11.878
On the night I would come in..

30:11.879 --> 30:13.613
Lock, turn the lights off.

30:13.614 --> 30:16.716
Come back two hours later.

30:16.717 --> 30:19.357
Lights are on..

30:20.454 --> 30:25.124
Doors are open, and
nobody's in the building.

30:25.125 --> 30:29.195
Now I've got to search the basement.

30:29.196 --> 30:34.157
It's mine to make sure
it's safe. It's secure.

30:34.158 --> 30:37.518
But I don't feel secure.

30:58.335 --> 31:02.105
It was a quiet evening,
and I'm in the control room.

31:02.106 --> 31:05.466
Yeah, I'm still at work.

31:05.710 --> 31:09.145
And I hear music, like, ragtime music.

31:09.146 --> 31:12.146
[Ragtime piano music]

31:12.350 --> 31:14.417
Hold on. I'll call you right back.

31:14.418 --> 31:16.740
Everything's locked. I'd
gone through the building.

31:16.741 --> 31:18.688
I checked. There was
nobody in the building.

31:18.689 --> 31:21.689
[Ragtime piano music]

31:28.283 --> 31:33.023
The music wasn't coming
from the auditorium.

31:35.974 --> 31:38.554
[Music loudens]

31:47.619 --> 31:53.519
I made my way down the east-side
stairwell, and the music's getting louder.

32:01.538 --> 32:07.438
If I could come around the corner
and see a prankster on the piano..

32:08.843 --> 32:12.563
I'd breathe a sigh of relief.

32:20.223 --> 32:23.463
[Loud slam, music stops]

32:33.976 --> 32:37.156
Where's the individual?

32:56.379 --> 32:59.259
[Piano cover slams]

33:00.821 --> 33:06.101
I witnessed enough. I
didn't have to see any more.

33:06.547 --> 33:09.412
Who am I gonna call, dispatch?

33:09.413 --> 33:13.481
The piano's playing and
nobody's in the building?

33:13.482 --> 33:15.190
I don't want to be in the building.

33:15.191 --> 33:18.491
I just want to get out.

33:22.290 --> 33:26.122
The next day I went and
saw my Sergeant, and I said,

33:26.123 --> 33:31.703
"if you ever put me in that
theater again, I'll quit".

33:39.176 --> 33:41.381
I've been a police officer for
about five and a half years.

33:41.382 --> 33:46.962
Um, at this time, I was in
protective services division.

33:48.019 --> 33:49.720
First time I worked at Capitol Theatre,

33:49.721 --> 33:54.461
I'm walking downstairs
to the basement area.

33:57.528 --> 34:03.428
I had already cleared the building, made
sure no one was inside, doors were locked.

34:07.505 --> 34:10.495
I was in the patrol car that night,

34:10.496 --> 34:14.199
making sure the other officers
were safe, everything was okay.

34:14.201 --> 34:16.273
How's it going over there?

34:16.274 --> 34:19.418
- Just doing the rounds.
- I just thought I'd check up on you.

34:19.418 --> 34:21.985
First night and all.

34:21.987 --> 34:24.627
[Motor whirring]

34:28.136 --> 34:29.710
[Elevator dings]

34:29.712 --> 34:33.371
Murphy, the elevator's moving.

34:33.815 --> 34:36.817
I know it's impossible, but it's moving.

34:36.818 --> 34:39.402
I'm on my way.

34:39.404 --> 34:41.984
[Siren wailing]

34:44.687 --> 34:48.226
I race over to the theater.

34:50.063 --> 34:52.704
[Elevator dings]

34:53.701 --> 34:56.341
[Elevator dings]

34:56.505 --> 34:59.085
[Siren wailing]

35:01.713 --> 35:02.726
[Elevator dings]

35:02.727 --> 35:05.427
[Door clattering]

35:11.771 --> 35:13.805
There's no one there.

35:13.806 --> 35:15.948
And that kind of just freaked me out.

35:15.949 --> 35:17.515
[Siren wailing]

35:17.516 --> 35:21.791
I got there as quickly as
I could, but that night,

35:21.792 --> 35:24.594
I had no desire to be in the building.

35:24.595 --> 35:26.721
He meets me at the door.

35:26.722 --> 35:32.362
I mean, his eyes were huge.
I mean, his expression was..

35:33.403 --> 35:37.997
As soon as he arrived, I let him
know that I haven't seen anyone leave.

35:37.998 --> 35:39.203
Uh, let's go ahead
and clear the building.

35:39.204 --> 35:44.484
So we got our guns drawn,
and we're going through.

35:54.690 --> 35:57.450
[Eerie whispering]

35:58.928 --> 35:59.894
Did you see that?

35:59.895 --> 36:03.786
I look in the mirror, and all of
a sudden, I see something run by.

36:03.787 --> 36:06.868
I look at Murphy. "Did
you just see that?"

36:06.869 --> 36:09.929
I don't see nothing.

36:15.578 --> 36:20.018
You take the right. I'll take the left.

36:20.507 --> 36:23.120
I go towards the stage door.

36:23.121 --> 36:26.781
That's quite a distance away.

36:32.413 --> 36:35.413
[Light bulb crackles]

36:36.554 --> 36:38.943
[Indistinct whispering]

36:38.944 --> 36:40.416
What'd you say?

36:40.417 --> 36:42.326
All of a sudden, I hear a whisper.

36:42.327 --> 36:45.234
Didn't say anything.

36:45.235 --> 36:47.717
And I noticed he's clear on
the other side of the stage.

36:47.718 --> 36:49.419
Quit messing with me, man.

36:49.420 --> 36:52.060
I said, "what?"

36:52.189 --> 36:55.859
He says, "you just whispered in my ear".

36:55.860 --> 36:57.125
I get it. It's creepy.

36:57.126 --> 36:59.646
And he's got his back turned
towards the back of the stage,

36:59.647 --> 37:03.068
and I'm looking at the auditorium
where all the seats are at.

37:03.069 --> 37:07.209
Murphy, there's something behind you.

37:19.211 --> 37:23.013
Murphy, there's something behind you.

37:23.014 --> 37:25.954
I turn around slow.

37:33.993 --> 37:36.513
[Demonic roar]

37:36.663 --> 37:39.667
Holy cow, this.. What is this?

37:39.668 --> 37:41.333
I didn't want to see it.

37:41.334 --> 37:46.514
I pulled out my flashlight, and I
point it at it, and it disappears.

37:46.515 --> 37:49.242
There's nothing there.

37:49.243 --> 37:52.043
And I know I'm not just seeing this.

37:52.044 --> 37:55.916
The eyes were deep-socketed, and
it was just looking right at me,

37:55.917 --> 38:00.177
and that kind of just freaked me out.

38:02.314 --> 38:06.622
Now, I wanted to find
out who these beings were

38:06.623 --> 38:12.115
or the stories that were circulating,
so I went back, and I talked to staff.

38:12.116 --> 38:17.528
I mean, I talked to a lot of people,
but they weren't saying a whole lot.

38:17.529 --> 38:20.290
So as I was leaving, this man came out.

38:20.291 --> 38:22.843
Officer Murphy.

38:22.844 --> 38:24.574
He handed me a piece of paper.

38:24.575 --> 38:29.675
He said, "contact this
man if he's still alive".

38:41.423 --> 38:46.048
Doug Morgan is a stagehand
who had worked there.

38:46.049 --> 38:49.218
He'd probably been around the
Capitol Theatre a good 40 years.

38:49.219 --> 38:53.719
I remember having
Dave come to the house.

38:54.091 --> 38:59.551
He had stories that he
wanted to fill up little holes

38:59.663 --> 39:01.798
in the stories he had heard.

39:01.799 --> 39:03.800
Doug, thanks again for having me.

39:03.801 --> 39:08.446
And I said, "Doug, you know, "this is
what's been happening to me over there,

39:08.447 --> 39:10.071
and people think I'm crazy.

39:10.072 --> 39:12.175
I said, "can you shed some light?"

39:12.176 --> 39:15.345
Haven't opened this
case in a lot of years.

39:15.346 --> 39:18.575
I first started working at the theater..

39:18.576 --> 39:20.736
In 1948.

39:21.051 --> 39:24.520
I was an Usher at that time.

39:24.521 --> 39:29.081
Well, one day, I was
running some errands.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.392
And when I returned..

39:31.393 --> 39:35.797
I found the Capitol Theatre
surrounded with fire trucks.

39:35.798 --> 39:38.558
This is a photo.

39:40.096 --> 39:41.568
I'm like, "fire?"

39:41.569 --> 39:43.849
Fire, yes.

39:46.743 --> 39:50.943
I got back. That's the scene I saw.

39:51.013 --> 39:55.393
The fire itself started in the basement.

39:56.552 --> 40:00.275
That afternoon, there
was a movie being shown.

40:00.276 --> 40:05.994
And at least 600 people, had to
be evacuated from the theater.

40:05.995 --> 40:09.055
Well, Dougie had told me
that he knew another boy

40:09.056 --> 40:12.776
by the name of Richard Duffin.

40:13.604 --> 40:16.861
Richard Duffin was a new Usher.

40:16.862 --> 40:19.354
He went back in to help the..

40:19.355 --> 40:23.135
The folks that were still lost.

40:26.348 --> 40:30.236
Well, Richard was
trapped in that basement.

40:30.237 --> 40:34.017
And very possibly lost his way.

40:34.089 --> 40:37.210
And was overcome by this smoke.

40:37.211 --> 40:42.371
While he was trying to
help these people get out.

40:44.399 --> 40:46.834
There it was in black and white..

40:46.835 --> 40:51.038
Back in the '40s, the fire
in the Capitol Theatre..

40:51.039 --> 40:56.939
And the boy.. The young boy, Duffin..
The Usher that died in the fire.

40:59.639 --> 41:04.199
I think that Duffin
was a very brave man.

41:04.853 --> 41:08.853
Doug Morgan verified everything
I saw and everything I witnessed.

41:08.854 --> 41:10.419
Well, Doug, thanks
very much for seeing me.

41:10.420 --> 41:12.032
Well, thanks for coming over, Dave.

41:12.033 --> 41:17.031
This man almost brought me
to tears, because I knew..

41:17.032 --> 41:20.100
I knew before, I wasn't crazy.

41:20.101 --> 41:24.241
To this day, I know I'm not crazy.

41:24.981 --> 41:28.776
It just made sense with everything, you
know, everything that I'd gone through.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.545
A shaking door..

41:30.546 --> 41:31.980
Someone's trapped, and
they're trying to get out.

41:31.981 --> 41:32.963
[Door handle rattling]

41:32.964 --> 41:35.810
Here's this fire that killed somebody.

41:35.811 --> 41:39.711
And yet I can still smell smoke.

41:41.790 --> 41:45.593
I had been told by other officers,
"you need to learn to shut your mouth".

41:45.594 --> 41:48.354
Mm-mm, I can't.

41:49.486 --> 41:51.867
They were thinking I was making this up.

41:51.868 --> 41:55.528
I wanted to prove them wrong.

41:58.274 --> 42:00.142
I know what I saw.

42:00.143 --> 42:02.611
I know what I felt.

42:02.612 --> 42:07.472
These things.. That's
a part of my life now.
