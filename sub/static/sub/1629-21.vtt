Once Upon A Time...

ZELENA: I’m powerless.
Regina’s got my pendant.

00:06.591 --> 00:07.876
EMMA: Wanna meet your new uncle?

00:07.967 --> 00:10.253
-I saw Regina take your dagger.
-She gave it to Belle.

00:10.344 --> 00:13.051
If she has the dagger,
you'll have to do what she wishes.

00:13.139 --> 00:15.471
But she doesn't. Belle has a fake.

00:16.100 --> 00:17.089
(GASPS)

00:24.525 --> 00:27.016
Has your power returned
now that Zelena's been defeated?

00:27.111 --> 00:28.942
No. Iwon't need it in New York.

01:05.316 --> 01:07.307
WOMAN: All right, everyone,
back inside. Come on.

01:08.194 --> 01:10.981
-Back inside. It's almost dinner time.
-(ENG|NE STARTS)

Don't worry,
you'll find a home too, Emma.

01:41.811 --> 01:43.096
DAVID: Emma, you okay?

01:43.187 --> 01:45.473
What? Yeah, of course.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.350
You guys gonna finally tell me
the name of my little brother,

01:47.441 --> 01:48.726
or should Ijust
keep calling him, "Hey, there!"

01:48.859 --> 01:52.852
(SCOFFS) Well, the thing is,
there's sort of this tradition.

01:53.489 --> 01:56.231
Back in the enchanted forest,
when a new royal is born,

01:56.325 --> 01:58.862
you usually announce the name
in a coronation ceremony.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.364
We would have done it with you,
if we could have.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.991
You're not gonna hold him out
in front of the clock tower

02:03.082 --> 02:04.413
and present him like Lion King,
are you?

02:04.500 --> 02:05.910
(LAUGHING) Of course not.

02:06.502 --> 02:10.290
In fact, we've decided to forgo
all pomp and circumstance

02:10.381 --> 02:12.463
for a nice potluck at Granny's.

02:12.883 --> 02:15.750
MARY: The important thing
is to mark the occasion.

02:15.845 --> 02:18.552
Remind ourselves that
after all that we've been through,

02:18.639 --> 02:20.846
we're still together. As a family.

02:24.103 --> 02:25.092
(DOOR CLOSES)

02:25.730 --> 02:28.346
Hey, check it out!
I think I found us a place.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.894
You're looking for apartments?

02:30.985 --> 02:32.316
What do you think?

02:34.530 --> 02:36.737
Yeah, Emma. What do you think?

02:40.494 --> 02:44.078
I think your grandparents can't decide
what to name your uncle

02:44.165 --> 02:45.826
and they are using a fairy-tale tradition

02:45.916 --> 02:48.123
to try to buy themselves some time.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.050
ROBIN HOOD:
To the return of your heart.

03:00.306 --> 03:02.672
So, how does it feel?

03:04.894 --> 03:06.475
Stronger than ever.

03:09.190 --> 03:10.179
Mmm.

03:21.744 --> 03:23.200
What is it?

03:25.581 --> 03:27.993
I just never thought I'd have this.

03:29.960 --> 03:30.949
(LAUGHS)

03:31.921 --> 03:34.879
After I lost my wife,

03:34.965 --> 03:37.422
I felt like that for a long time.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.259
Her death was my fault.

03:41.806 --> 03:43.091
I'm sorry.

03:44.266 --> 03:48.134
Iwould have walked through hell
to be with my Marian again.

03:50.356 --> 03:53.473
But when I finally
admitted to myself that she was gone,

03:53.776 --> 03:56.313
and that she was never coming back,

03:57.988 --> 03:59.728
I had to let that guilt go.

04:00.366 --> 04:03.153
My first love, Daniel,
was killed because of me.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.618
Because he loved me.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.117
And that's why you never wanted
to open yourself up again?

04:11.001 --> 04:14.914
Tinker Bell told me it was possible.

04:15.214 --> 04:16.920
I could love again.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.007
She led me to this tavern.

04:21.095 --> 04:25.213
To a man who she said
I was destined to be with.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.223
I never saw his face,

04:30.396 --> 04:31.431
but

04:32.773 --> 04:34.889
I did see his tattoo.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.023
It was me?

04:37.111 --> 04:38.226
Yes.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.313
I was just too scared to approach you.

04:45.244 --> 04:49.112
Well, maybe things work out
when they're supposed to.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.706
Maybe it's all about timing.

05:16.859 --> 05:17.848
(BELLS JINGLE)

05:20.070 --> 05:23.813
Look. This...
This is too much power to keep with me.

05:23.908 --> 05:24.988
No, I don't want it, Belle.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.657
-The point was I trust you.
-I know.

05:27.745 --> 05:30.987
Well, then, is there somewhere
I can store it safely?

05:31.081 --> 05:34.665
Like back in our land, at your castle,
you had that vault.

05:34.752 --> 05:36.583
The... The one with no doors.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.833
That was for only the most dangerous
and unstable magic.

05:39.924 --> 05:41.710
That which even I couldn't comprehend.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.461
And this doesn't qualify?

05:44.178 --> 05:45.384
No.

05:45.471 --> 05:48.053
You see, I understand this all too well.

05:48.766 --> 05:51.724
I left that vault
and all its dangers behind.

05:52.645 --> 05:56.137
But this dagger is not dangerous,
because as I said,

05:56.232 --> 05:57.688
I trust you.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.643
Let's discuss
something a bit more pleasant,

06:01.737 --> 06:03.853
like, uh, our wedding.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.150
Yes.

06:06.242 --> 06:08.904
I told my father the good news

06:08.994 --> 06:10.985
and he gave us his blessing.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.662
The man who kidnapped you
in order to keep us apart?

06:13.749 --> 06:17.082
Well, I've forgiven him.
And he's forgiven you.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.670
He knows you're a changed man.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.753
I mean, everyone does.

06:22.258 --> 06:23.794
Especially me.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.771

-That's a good thing,

06:39.858 --> 06:41.814
because if that Sleeping Beauty
had been a monkey a day longer,

06:41.902 --> 06:43.984
she would've had a monkey baby.

Really? I can't hear the kid's name yet,
but I have to hear this story again?

07:00.921 --> 07:03.082
Well, my son should know
where he comes from.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.300
EMMA: Are you sure you want
the first thing he knows

07:05.384 --> 07:07.249
to be that his parents fell in love
during an armed robbery?

07:07.344 --> 07:08.629
I wasn't armed.

07:08.721 --> 07:10.131
Except with a rock.

07:10.222 --> 07:12.429
-I still have the scar.
-Which healed.

07:12.850 --> 07:15.762
But that's just how we met.
It's not how we fell in love.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.809
Yeah, that was a bit more complicated.

07:19.189 --> 07:23.023
See, there were Black Knights
when I saved your mother's life.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.350
Oh.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.147
And the attack on the Troll Bridge
when I saved his.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.491
But it wasn't until
I saw my mother's ring on her finger

07:32.578 --> 07:34.239
that I knew, in my heart,

07:34.330 --> 07:36.821
there was
no other woman I would ever love.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.908
lwish you had told me then.
We would have saved so much time.

I had to get to my wedding.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.419
Sorry. Have I missed something?

No. She was here when I left her.

that would explain the time portal.

Impossible.

Without her pendant, she's powerless.

let alone open
a time portal without magic?

curb any homicidal tendencies.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.257
I won't ask for an apology.

10:44.436 --> 10:47.644
She must've had just enough
residual magic to do herself in.

10:48.857 --> 10:52.020
And when she did, when she was gone,

10:52.110 --> 10:55.443
the magic in her pendant had no tether.
It was set free.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.365
Her last wish fulfilled.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.064
So how do we un-fulfill it?

10:59.159 --> 11:00.239
Excellent question.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.535
But until we figure it out,
no one should go near it.

catastrophic repercussions.

I don't wanna talk to you about this.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.012
Don't listen to me. Listen to your son.

11:24.852 --> 11:28.845
He thought this might remind you
of what you're leaving behind.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.349
Your family.

11:31.275 --> 11:34.233
Henry is my family,
and I am taking him where he is safe.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.277
No, Swan, the safety first nonsense
is just that.

11:38.156 --> 11:41.114
You defeated the bloody Wicked Witch.
You defeated Pan.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.817
You broke the curse.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.027
But you keep running.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.078
What are you looking for?

11:47.165 --> 11:48.245
Home.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.329
And that's in New York?
That wasn't real.

11:51.420 --> 11:52.455
The last year was.

11:52.546 --> 11:55.583
They were false memories.
It was based on magical nonsense.

11:55.674 --> 11:58.086
Now we have our memories back.
Now we can make it real.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.504
Why can't you do that here
with your entire family?

12:02.180 --> 12:03.761
Because of this.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.931
I don't see my family here.

12:07.019 --> 12:11.558
I see fairy tales, I see stories
of princes and princesses.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.356
That's not me.
I was never a part of any of this.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.730
Then what are you a part of, Swan?

12:17.821 --> 12:20.688
Besides being with Henry, I don't think
I've ever been a part of anything.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.189
But you could be.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.701
Look, when I was a kid I ran away.
It's just what I did.

12:27.039 --> 12:29.951
But the first time I did it,
I had the same exact thought.

12:30.292 --> 12:33.534
I wondered,
"What if I'm making a mistake?

12:33.879 --> 12:36.120
-"What if I miss this place?"
-Did you?

12:36.590 --> 12:39.423
Not the first time. Not any time.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.424
So you just keep running?

12:42.262 --> 12:44.799
I learned something
a long time ago, Hook.

12:45.933 --> 12:49.050
Home is the place when you leave,

12:49.978 --> 12:51.843
you just miss it.

12:52.773 --> 12:56.231
So yeah, I'm gonna keep running
until I feel that.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.058
So you're just gonna
leave your parents, then?

12:58.153 --> 13:00.565
Don't you even care about them?

13:01.531 --> 13:03.067
Or anyone in this town?

13:04.368 --> 13:05.778
Of course I care.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.700

37:50.894 --> 37:54.512
Really? You get my first dance
at my first royal ball,

37:54.606 --> 37:56.267
and all you can say is, "I told you so"?

37:56.733 --> 37:59.440
I believe what I'm trying to say,
Your Highness,

38:00.863 --> 38:03.354
is that you appear to be a natural.

38:05.284 --> 38:06.899
There's Charming.

38:08.912 --> 38:10.573
Would you care to dance?

38:10.706 --> 38:12.071
My feet are killing me.

38:12.708 --> 38:15.541
If only I'd thought
to wear my comfortable shoes.

38:16.545 --> 38:18.877
Would you like me
to fetch them for you, my dear?

38:18.964 --> 38:20.249
My hero.

38:29.558 --> 38:30.547
(SIGHS)

38:38.066 --> 38:39.055
(GASPS)

38:42.988 --> 38:44.228
Where is that ring?

38:59.171 --> 39:00.331
What a pleasure, my Queen.

39:01.006 --> 39:04.123
I thank you for honoring my daughter
with your presence.

39:04.259 --> 39:07.467
And thank you
for your generous hospitality.

39:07.763 --> 39:10.345
I hope you don't mind,
I brought some friends.

39:11.767 --> 39:12.756
Regina's here.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.141
Damn it.
This definitely was not in the plan.

39:18.273 --> 39:19.774
Breathe, Swan. She's a guest.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.520
The King's head would vanish
to another realm if he didn't invite her.

39:22.611 --> 39:24.272
Yeah, good point.

39:25.948 --> 39:27.609
Where's Charming?

39:34.998 --> 39:36.033
(GASPS)

39:36.124 --> 39:37.864
My ticket to freedom.

39:41.463 --> 39:42.543
Who are you?

39:43.840 --> 39:44.966
Stop! Thief!

39:47.678 --> 39:48.963
(BOTH GRUNT)

39:49.555 --> 39:50.544
You're a girl?

39:51.056 --> 39:52.216
Woman.

39:52.474 --> 39:53.463
(BOTH GRUNT)

39:53.850 --> 39:54.839
(GROANS)

39:56.812 --> 39:58.473
James. What's taking you so...

39:59.898 --> 40:00.978
You're...

40:02.484 --> 40:03.724
You're Snow White.

40:05.654 --> 40:06.643
Snow White!

40:06.989 --> 40:08.024
Snow White!

40:08.574 --> 40:09.814
(CROWD MURMURING)

40:09.908 --> 40:12.115
My Lord,
Snow White was spotted in the castle.

40:12.202 --> 40:14.909
The bandit Snow White? Here?
Get her.

40:27.801 --> 40:28.790
(GASPS)

40:41.189 --> 40:44.022
She did it!
She must have stolen the ring!

40:44.151 --> 40:45.140
(GROANING)

40:49.531 --> 40:51.032
(CLICKS TONGUE) Hyah! Hyah!

40:51.116 --> 40:52.822
You can't hide from me!

40:52.909 --> 40:54.900
Wherever you are, I will find you!

40:59.583 --> 41:00.914
Mission accomplished.
Now all we have to do...

41:01.710 --> 41:02.870
You'll find her
sooner than you think, my lord!

41:03.170 --> 41:04.159
(BOW CREAKS)

41:05.672 --> 41:06.661
EMMA: No. (GRUNTS)

41:14.598 --> 41:15.633
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

41:15.724 --> 41:16.679
The ring.

41:16.767 --> 41:19.224
You've got to get it to Snow.
Go! Igot this.

41:21.229 --> 41:22.218
(GRUNTS)

41:29.946 --> 41:31.937
There she is!
She helped the bandit escape.

41:35.118 --> 41:36.403
Going somewhere?

41:38.121 --> 41:39.110
(GRUNTS)

41:45.462 --> 41:46.577
Regina, I...

41:46.672 --> 41:48.412
That's a bit informal, wouldn't you say?

41:48.840 --> 41:50.580
Show some respect.

41:51.093 --> 41:53.755
It's "Your Majesty."

41:57.432 --> 41:58.421
QUEEN: Uh-uh.

41:59.017 --> 42:00.097
You're not going anywhere.

42:01.603 --> 42:03.844
Snow White may have
left the party early,

42:04.981 --> 42:07.267
but I suspect your night has just begun.

42:08.235 --> 42:09.224
(CHUCKLES)

42:09.611 --> 42:10.600
Take her away.

42:10.946 --> 42:12.277
GUARD: Come on.
