00:00.033 --> 00:01.472
Previously on Finding Carter...

00:01.484 --> 00:03.984
It's about Lori. She tried to kill herself.

00:04.009 --> 00:04.975
Have you talked to her?

00:05.060 --> 00:06.176
No, and I'm not going to.

00:06.261 --> 00:07.728
She could have died

00:07.763 --> 00:09.096
and you're acting like you
wouldn't have even cared.

00:09.181 --> 00:10.514
I think I'd like to see her.

00:10.599 --> 00:11.765
You shouldn't have come.

00:11.850 --> 00:13.100
No, I'm not gonna leave.

00:13.185 --> 00:14.267
I need to be alone, go away.

00:14.319 --> 00:15.268
I love you.

00:15.354 --> 00:16.937
Tell me you love me more.

00:17.022 --> 00:18.071
She said she loved me.

00:18.107 --> 00:19.856
She said I was her mom.

00:19.942 --> 00:22.442
It's gonna be okay.

00:24.279 --> 00:26.163
What is Carter's necklace doing in here?

00:26.248 --> 00:27.581
Max and I slept together.

00:27.616 --> 00:28.949
Don't give up on me, okay?

00:29.001 --> 00:30.867
I'm learning how to forgive.

00:30.953 --> 00:32.119
This feels good.

00:32.171 --> 00:34.454
I missed you.

00:34.540 --> 00:35.622
You're not leaving him.

00:35.708 --> 00:37.290
I can see that I'm hurting you.

00:37.342 --> 00:39.259
I had no idea that this was gonna

00:39.294 --> 00:40.260
turn out the way it did.

00:40.295 --> 00:41.461
Come on, Liz.

00:41.513 --> 00:43.630
You might be sorry for hurting me,

00:43.682 --> 00:46.383
but you're not sorry that
this is the way it's ending up.

00:47.302 --> 00:48.518
Sorry, Detective.

00:48.604 --> 00:49.302
No!

00:49.388 --> 00:50.520
Kyle!

00:50.606 --> 00:51.722
Stay with me!

00:51.807 --> 00:53.223
Don't leave me, okay, partner!

00:53.308 --> 00:54.808
I need some help!

00:54.860 --> 00:58.195
I need some help!

00:58.280 --> 00:59.896
You should get to the hospital.

00:59.982 --> 01:01.198
Gabe's gonna need you.

01:01.283 --> 01:03.400
- Why?
- Kyle's dead.

01:14.546 --> 01:15.545
Sure you don't want any?

01:15.597 --> 01:16.930
Eggplant parm's pretty good.

01:17.016 --> 01:17.764
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:17.850 --> 01:18.882
Funeral was about a week ago.

01:18.934 --> 01:20.434
I figured I'd bring the food over

01:20.519 --> 01:23.020
and maybe my relatives
would take a hint and leave.

01:24.773 --> 01:27.891
Why do people always bring
casseroles when somebody dies?

01:27.976 --> 01:30.727
Why not soups or salads
or cakes or something?

01:30.813 --> 01:32.112
'Cause you can just pop
'em in the microwave.

01:32.197 --> 01:33.647
Yeah, you can freeze them
and save them for later.

01:33.732 --> 01:35.232
And they're easy to carry.

01:35.284 --> 01:37.401
This conversation could
be perceived as morbid.

01:37.453 --> 01:38.702
Sorry.

01:38.737 --> 01:39.903
No, it's cool, you're
just stating the facts.

01:39.988 --> 01:42.289
Death and casseroles
do seem to go together.

01:42.374 --> 01:45.742
You know you can stay with
us if you need to, right?

01:45.828 --> 01:47.744
Yeah, thank you. I appreciate that.

01:47.830 --> 01:49.463
But once my relatives leave,

01:49.548 --> 01:50.914
which I'm hoping is today,

01:50.966 --> 01:52.799
I'm kind of looking forward
to getting my house back.

01:52.885 --> 01:54.000
Wow, you have a lot of cousins.

01:54.086 --> 01:55.919
Most of them I have never even met before.

01:55.971 --> 01:58.088
Yeah, it's weird what brings
people out of the woodwork.

01:58.173 --> 01:59.589
Okay.

02:00.809 --> 02:04.261
Gabe, what do you want to do right now?

02:04.313 --> 02:06.063
We'll do anything you want.

02:06.098 --> 02:07.264
I'm good just hanging out.

02:07.332 --> 02:09.014
Okay.

02:09.101 --> 02:12.319
Well, then we will just do that.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.419
Are you guys cool?

02:29.455 --> 02:31.037
Yeah, we're good.

02:41.075 --> 02:46.412
♪ Hoping it's all right,
old enough to die ♪

03:20.532 --> 03:22.615
Hey, can we talk?

03:24.118 --> 03:25.451
Look, I know you're still mad at me,

03:25.537 --> 03:26.619
and I don't blame you,

03:26.704 --> 03:28.538
but I want to make it up to you.

03:28.623 --> 03:29.589
How, Madison?

03:29.674 --> 03:31.007
You have been lying to my face

03:31.042 --> 03:32.425
since the moment you got here...

03:32.510 --> 03:34.877
when you had every opportunity
to tell me the truth.

03:34.963 --> 03:37.296
Carter, it's for you.

03:43.805 --> 03:44.720
Who is it?

03:44.806 --> 03:46.305
I don't know, some guy.

03:47.559 --> 03:48.558
Hi.

03:48.643 --> 03:49.692
Are you Carter Stevens?

03:49.727 --> 03:51.394
Uh, yeah?

03:52.530 --> 03:53.729
You've been served.

04:00.371 --> 04:01.571
Oh, my God.

04:01.623 --> 04:05.408
Lori's going on trial.

04:28.932 --> 04:30.132
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:31.769 --> 04:34.770
How is she suddenly considered
competent to stand trial?

04:34.856 --> 04:36.939
It says she petitioned for a reevaluation

04:37.025 --> 04:38.774
and the doctor signed off on it.

04:38.860 --> 04:40.660
You saw how unstable she was.

04:40.745 --> 04:42.778
Your mother's on the phone
with the D.A.'s office now.

04:42.864 --> 04:44.447
I don't know, maybe it'll
turn out to be a good thing.

04:44.532 --> 04:46.115
What did you find out?

04:46.200 --> 04:48.451
This is a complicated
situation because not only

04:48.503 --> 04:49.919
is she trying to get out,

04:49.954 --> 04:52.622
but she's trying to get custody of you.

04:55.176 --> 04:57.793
How are they even
considering letting her out?

04:57.845 --> 04:59.095
In the state of Virginia,

04:59.130 --> 05:00.463
when a child is detained by a legal parent,

05:00.515 --> 05:02.465
it's considered a
misdemeanor, not a felony.

05:02.550 --> 05:03.933
But she was never my legal parent.

05:03.968 --> 05:05.885
Well, her defense attorney
is going to try to prove

05:05.970 --> 05:07.019
that she was your legal parent

05:07.105 --> 05:08.354
when she abducted you.

05:08.439 --> 05:10.556
- You guys are my legal parents.
- Yes, exactly.

05:10.642 --> 05:11.691
She doesn't have a leg to stand on.

05:11.776 --> 05:13.693
David, it's the egg donation.

05:13.778 --> 05:14.810
It's not black and white anymore.

05:14.896 --> 05:16.445
That's ridiculous.

05:16.481 --> 05:18.147
The law is on our side.

05:18.199 --> 05:19.815
A jury would have to agree with us.

05:19.901 --> 05:21.150
What happens if they don't?

05:21.202 --> 05:23.653
Her penalty could be reduced.

05:23.738 --> 05:24.904
To what?

05:24.989 --> 05:27.323
Less than a year.

05:28.660 --> 05:29.792
Time served.

05:29.827 --> 05:31.994
She could be released immediately.

05:34.882 --> 05:36.382
It is so supremely creepy

05:36.467 --> 05:39.752
that Lori's making Carter
testify at her trial.

05:39.837 --> 05:41.220
I just feel like such an idiot

05:41.306 --> 05:42.221
for letting her use me.

05:42.307 --> 05:44.173
You're not the first one she's used.

05:44.258 --> 05:45.975
You probably won't be the last.

05:46.010 --> 05:48.344
Whoa, did you guys leave that door open?

05:48.396 --> 05:49.345
No, did you?

05:49.430 --> 05:50.346
I don't think so.

05:50.431 --> 05:52.181
There's someone in there.

05:57.488 --> 05:58.854
- Stay here.
- Max, no.

06:07.365 --> 06:08.447
Jesus!

06:08.483 --> 06:10.616
It's my parents.

06:10.652 --> 06:12.618
I don't get it.

06:12.654 --> 06:13.953
When I saw her,

06:13.988 --> 06:16.489
she told me she never
wanted to see me again.

06:16.541 --> 06:17.740
Or so she said.

06:17.825 --> 06:19.325
Maybe she changed her mind.

06:19.377 --> 06:22.662
But even if she somehow
convinced a jury to let her go

06:22.714 --> 06:23.879
and she got custody,

06:23.965 --> 06:25.164
what does she have to gain?

06:25.249 --> 06:26.832
Carter doesn't want to live with her.

06:26.918 --> 06:28.751
A judge would have to consider that.

06:28.836 --> 06:31.671
Well, if a jury says she's Carter's mother,

06:31.756 --> 06:34.590
the judge would probably consider that.

06:34.676 --> 06:37.059
I hate what she is doing to us.

06:37.145 --> 06:38.811
God, I should have never gone and seen her.

06:38.846 --> 06:40.479
Carter, it's not your fault.

06:40.515 --> 06:42.682
You tried to help. You did the right thing.

06:42.734 --> 06:45.401
God, this is so weird.

06:45.486 --> 06:46.736
She got her ex-boyfriend

06:46.821 --> 06:49.739
to come ask me to help put her in there,

06:49.824 --> 06:51.107
then she sends me all these letters,

06:51.192 --> 06:53.526
- lures me up there.
- Lures you?

06:53.611 --> 06:56.529
Are you saying the suicide
attempt wasn't real?

06:57.865 --> 06:59.332
Oh, sick.

06:59.367 --> 07:03.502
I mean, maybe she's been
thinking about this all along.

07:03.538 --> 07:06.038
Oh, my God, what if this was
her plan from the beginning?

07:06.090 --> 07:08.424
- To get out of prison?
- To get you back?

07:08.509 --> 07:09.792
I don't know.

07:09.877 --> 07:12.878
God, why are we still having
to deal with this stuff?

07:12.964 --> 07:14.380
It's okay, Carter.

07:14.465 --> 07:16.515
We're gonna go to talk to
the D.A. this afternoon.

07:16.551 --> 07:18.801
We're gonna find out what she's up to.

07:29.681 --> 07:31.064
You guys doing okay?

07:31.149 --> 07:32.982
Yeah, we're fine.

07:33.018 --> 07:35.351
It's pretty screwed up. The trial thing.

07:35.437 --> 07:39.389
Yeah, but it's good to
be here, hanging out.

07:39.458 --> 07:42.659
You realize, right, not
actually hanging out?

07:42.694 --> 07:43.693
You're obsessively cleaning?

07:43.762 --> 07:45.161
It's what I do.

07:45.197 --> 07:46.830
It's her coping mechanism.

07:46.865 --> 07:49.499
What about you? You got one?

07:49.534 --> 07:50.583
Hmm?

07:50.669 --> 07:53.036
Oh. No, I wish.

07:53.121 --> 07:54.537
That's what these are for.

07:56.041 --> 07:57.507
Jump, over the guy! Jump! Jump!

07:57.542 --> 07:59.259
- Oh, jump.
- How do you jump!

07:59.344 --> 08:00.510
Push "A." "A", "A," "A."

08:00.545 --> 08:01.544
He's not jumping!

08:01.596 --> 08:02.796
Jump, jump, you gotta jump!

08:02.881 --> 08:03.847
Jump!

08:06.134 --> 08:07.050
Wow.

08:07.135 --> 08:08.134
You're really kinda bad at this.

08:08.220 --> 08:09.302
It wasn't me, he wasn't jumping.

08:09.387 --> 08:10.270
Mm-hmm.

08:10.275 --> 08:12.692
Okay, I'm up. Give it to me.

08:12.778 --> 08:14.894
Gabe, where are the Swiffers?

08:14.980 --> 08:17.781
Uh... are they not underneath the sink?

08:17.816 --> 08:19.816
No. I can't find them.

08:19.901 --> 08:22.452
I don't know.

08:22.487 --> 08:25.905
My dad... usually takes care of that stuff.

08:25.991 --> 08:30.210
Oh, well, don't worry about it.

08:30.295 --> 08:31.494
I'll find them.

08:36.635 --> 08:38.918
Hey.

08:40.806 --> 08:42.304
Look.

08:42.340 --> 08:45.341
None of us have any idea what
you're going through right now.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.811
Yeah.

08:47.846 --> 08:48.845
I don't know.

08:48.930 --> 08:50.180
I've always known the risks.

08:50.232 --> 08:51.681
It doesn't make it easier, man.

08:51.767 --> 08:53.900
No, but it's something we
talked about all the time.

08:53.985 --> 08:55.485
And he prepped me for it.

08:55.520 --> 08:58.021
He said if, you know,
something were to ever happen,

08:58.073 --> 09:00.023
to be strong and move on with my life.

09:00.108 --> 09:02.158
So that's what I'm gonna do.

09:02.194 --> 09:04.277
Okay, but if there's anything we can do,

09:04.362 --> 09:05.528
you just let us know, all right?

09:05.614 --> 09:07.781
All I need you to do is act normal.

09:07.866 --> 09:09.115
We can do normal.

09:09.201 --> 09:10.417
See, I that might be kind of a stretch,

09:10.502 --> 09:11.418
but we can definitely try.

09:11.503 --> 09:12.869
Thanks.

09:12.954 --> 09:15.255
Oh, I found them!

09:15.340 --> 09:16.456
Sweet.

09:17.876 --> 09:18.842
All right, who's up?

09:18.877 --> 09:20.427
Me.

09:20.512 --> 09:22.178
My next victim.

09:22.214 --> 09:26.599
Neglectful, hypocritical,
overbearing, self-absorbed.

09:26.685 --> 09:28.635
- Bird, it's cool.
- I'm on a roll here.

09:28.720 --> 09:32.055
Unethical, corrupt. Overbearing.

09:32.140 --> 09:33.223
You already said that one.

09:33.275 --> 09:34.774
Yeah, well, I'm saying it again.

09:34.860 --> 09:36.309
You can't really blame 'em
for not wanting three people

09:36.394 --> 09:37.694
staying in their guest house.

09:37.729 --> 09:39.112
Yeah, well, you think they'd be grateful

09:39.197 --> 09:41.364
that you guys kept me
company while they were gone.

09:41.399 --> 09:43.867
I think you implying that we
were some kind of threesome

09:43.902 --> 09:45.235
might have thrown them.

09:45.320 --> 09:48.738
Well, I just said it to annoy them.

09:48.790 --> 09:50.457
- Apparently, it worked.
- I'm sorry.

09:50.542 --> 09:53.827
I didn't know they'd kick you guys out.

09:53.912 --> 09:55.211
No, it's cool.

09:55.247 --> 09:56.796
I've actually been thinking about

09:56.882 --> 09:57.914
getting my own place again.

09:57.999 --> 09:59.582
I could use a fresh start.

09:59.668 --> 10:02.302
Oh, fine, abandon me.

10:02.387 --> 10:03.586
I'm used to it.

10:03.638 --> 10:05.722
What about you?

10:05.757 --> 10:09.592
Where are you gonna go?

10:09.644 --> 10:10.760
No idea.

10:10.812 --> 10:13.263
What is wrong with me?

10:13.315 --> 10:14.981
Why didn't I just stand up for myself.

10:15.066 --> 10:18.935
Instead, I let them walk
all over me, as usual.

10:18.987 --> 10:21.271
They're your parents.

10:21.356 --> 10:22.772
You know, it's not that easy.

10:22.824 --> 10:24.107
Look at me, I...

10:24.159 --> 10:26.693
I ran away, instead of confronting mine.

10:26.778 --> 10:28.578
That's why it pisses me off.

10:28.613 --> 10:30.580
Max wants to find a place.

10:30.615 --> 10:33.283
You have no place to go.

10:41.126 --> 10:42.342
What are we doing here?

10:42.427 --> 10:47.514
Well, like I said, Bird's parents are back,

10:47.599 --> 10:48.882
so I've got to move on.

10:48.967 --> 10:50.466
But why your old apartment.

10:50.552 --> 10:52.936
There are a million places for rent.

10:52.971 --> 10:54.470
And we had some...

10:54.556 --> 10:56.222
some pretty good time in this place.

10:56.308 --> 10:58.975
Pretty happy here and I just thought that

10:59.060 --> 11:01.027
if it was here and I was here,

11:01.112 --> 11:02.445
you might wanna be here, too.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.148
Max, I'm not even out of high school yet.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.149
I can't move in with you.

11:06.201 --> 11:07.984
No, I'm... I know that.

11:08.036 --> 11:10.320
I'm not asking you to live here,

11:10.405 --> 11:12.488
I just want you to know that it is here

11:12.574 --> 11:14.741
if you ever need it.

11:14.826 --> 11:17.327
And me.

11:19.247 --> 11:20.580
That's really nice.

11:20.665 --> 11:24.167
So you think you'll
come by once in a while?

11:25.720 --> 11:26.836
Yeah, yeah.

11:26.888 --> 11:29.005
Once in a while.

11:30.842 --> 11:37.564
♪ I will wait forever
'til you are mine ♪

11:39.901 --> 11:41.234
I'm not gonna lie, I...

11:41.319 --> 11:43.436
I think you need some stuff.

11:45.740 --> 11:48.107
We have a lot going for us at trial.

11:48.193 --> 11:50.243
Carter's gonna make a very good witness.

11:50.328 --> 11:53.029
What kind of, um, questions,
are they gonna ask me?

11:53.114 --> 11:54.864
We'll go through all that, very
carefully, just the two of us.

11:54.916 --> 11:56.499
Okay, good.

11:56.534 --> 11:59.502
Now, we just got their final witness list.

11:59.537 --> 12:01.037
None of these names look familiar.

12:01.089 --> 12:03.506
One of them's her doctor
at the mental hospital.

12:03.541 --> 12:05.124
And this one, Benjamin Wallace?

12:05.210 --> 12:06.843
They added him at the last minute,

12:06.878 --> 12:07.427
but if you see there,

12:07.513 --> 12:08.929
they've been having trouble contacting him.

12:09.314 --> 12:10.180
Who is he?

12:10.265 --> 12:11.598
As I said, they haven't located him

12:11.683 --> 12:12.649
and we haven't either.

12:12.684 --> 12:13.933
It's a short list.

12:14.019 --> 12:15.235
Well, that's a good thing, though, right?

12:15.320 --> 12:17.020
Well, there aren't a lot of people speaking

12:17.105 --> 12:18.605
to the defendant's character,

12:18.690 --> 12:22.158
which is why they will be
very quick to defame yours.

12:22.194 --> 12:23.576
They'll be quick to bring up the affair.

12:23.662 --> 12:25.028
They will do whatever they can

12:25.113 --> 12:27.363
to make her look good
and your family look bad.

12:27.449 --> 12:31.167
David, you'll notice your name
is first on that witness list.

12:31.203 --> 12:33.086
They can't wait to get you up there.

12:33.171 --> 12:35.288
This is what she's wanted all along.

12:35.373 --> 12:36.673
What, hon'?

12:36.708 --> 12:39.793
She wants to publicly humiliate you two,

12:39.878 --> 12:41.127
you for rejecting her

12:41.213 --> 12:43.379
and you for taking Taylor
and me away from her.

12:43.432 --> 12:45.932
They will bring up
graphic, intimate details

12:46.017 --> 12:47.550
of your sexual relationship with her.

12:47.602 --> 12:49.552
And just so you know,

12:49.638 --> 12:53.223
they will portray you as
an unhappy, infertile shrew.

12:53.275 --> 12:55.141
Okay, but if they put her away,

12:55.227 --> 12:57.393
she's gone for what, like
20 years or something?

12:57.479 --> 13:00.113
There's no way to know
what'll happen at trial.

13:00.198 --> 13:02.282
Juries do some very strange things.

13:02.367 --> 13:04.484
- You know that, Detective.
- Yeah, she's right.

13:04.569 --> 13:07.821
Anyway, this may never
even go to trial at all.

13:07.906 --> 13:09.205
What do you mean?

13:09.241 --> 13:11.124
I mean there is a plea deal on the table.

13:11.209 --> 13:12.542
Are they considering it?

13:12.577 --> 13:13.910
We hope so.

13:13.995 --> 13:15.628
As I said, juries are very unpredictable

13:15.714 --> 13:17.464
and at least with a deal,

13:17.549 --> 13:19.916
we know she'll be put away for ten years

13:19.968 --> 13:21.084
and we would avoid

13:21.169 --> 13:24.170
a very public, very ugly ordeal.

13:27.425 --> 13:29.092
Take it.

13:29.144 --> 13:31.144
Take the plea deal, Lori.

13:31.229 --> 13:33.179
Why would I ever do that?

13:33.265 --> 13:35.565
Because you'd be guaranteed
a ten-year sentence

13:35.600 --> 13:38.184
instead of leading up to a
jury who could give you 40.

13:38.270 --> 13:40.603
And believe me, if this does go to trial,

13:40.689 --> 13:43.773
I'm going to do absolutely
everything in my power

13:43.825 --> 13:46.276
to make sure that is exactly what happens.

13:46.328 --> 13:48.077
They're not gonna do that.

13:48.113 --> 13:49.612
And how do you know that?

13:50.098 --> 13:52.615
Once I make them understand
that I am your mother,

13:52.667 --> 13:53.616
they'll let me go.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.001
You are not my mother.

13:55.086 --> 13:57.036
Elizabeth Wilson is my mother.

13:57.122 --> 14:00.089
That's for the jury to decide.

14:00.125 --> 14:02.125
Carter, I know things

14:02.210 --> 14:04.127
can never go back to the way they were,

14:04.179 --> 14:06.296
but we could have a whole new start.

14:06.381 --> 14:10.600
Oh, my God. You really are insane.

14:10.635 --> 14:14.804
No, this trial is gonna change everything.

14:14.890 --> 14:18.558
Lori, I am 17 years old.

14:18.643 --> 14:20.476
You are never going to get custody of me

14:20.562 --> 14:23.029
because I am never going to agree to it.

14:23.114 --> 14:25.281
Sweetie, that's just not for you to decide.

14:25.317 --> 14:29.235
After everything you've done to us,

14:29.321 --> 14:32.205
you are just not going
to get away with this.

14:33.491 --> 14:34.490
We'll see.

14:39.418 --> 14:40.784
Hey.

14:40.869 --> 14:43.170
Hey, Armadillo.

14:43.255 --> 14:44.288
What are you doing?

14:44.340 --> 14:46.456
Oh, just looking over these notes

14:46.542 --> 14:47.541
from the D.A. for tomorrow.

14:47.626 --> 14:49.009
You nervous?

14:49.094 --> 14:50.711
A little.

14:50.796 --> 14:52.929
Listen, Grant.

14:52.965 --> 14:55.349
You're probably gonna
hear some stuff tomorrow

14:55.434 --> 14:56.550
about Mom and Dad in court.

14:56.635 --> 14:57.968
I've heard it all before.

14:58.020 --> 14:59.386
Okay.

14:59.471 --> 15:01.688
I just wanted to make sure
you knew that in advance.

15:01.774 --> 15:04.558
We're gonna be fine though, okay?

15:04.643 --> 15:07.194
Yeah, yeah, of course.

15:07.279 --> 15:10.197
As the captain of the
junior high mock trial,

15:10.282 --> 15:12.482
can I give you a tip?

15:12.568 --> 15:13.650
Sure.

15:13.702 --> 15:17.154
All right, well, first of all...

15:17.239 --> 15:18.739
- Grant.
- Stop reading those.

15:18.824 --> 15:22.209
Say what they want you to
say, but in your own words.

15:22.294 --> 15:24.211
If you sound like you rehearsed,

15:24.296 --> 15:26.830
the jury won't listen.

15:26.980 --> 15:29.030
That's really good advice.

15:29.066 --> 15:31.733
Hey, I'll be there rooting for you.

15:31.785 --> 15:32.784
We all will.

15:32.870 --> 15:34.903
Thank you.

15:34.988 --> 15:37.122
No problem, Elephant.

15:39.460 --> 15:40.742
I have a confession.

15:40.794 --> 15:43.211
I didn't actually learn that at mock trial.

15:43.247 --> 15:47.249
I learned it from "The Good Wife." Sue me.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.637
Hey, how you doing?

15:55.723 --> 15:57.422
I'm okay.

15:59.093 --> 16:01.176
You sure?

16:01.262 --> 16:02.094
Yeah, actually.

16:02.146 --> 16:04.146
I was... I was just thinking about

16:04.231 --> 16:06.848
how amazing our kids are,
how they're handling this.

16:06.934 --> 16:08.600
Just want to get them through it.

16:08.652 --> 16:11.570
It doesn't matter what comes out, you know?

16:11.605 --> 16:15.774
Or how it makes... us look.

16:15.859 --> 16:18.110
It just doesn't seem important anymore.

16:18.195 --> 16:20.662
You're pretty amazing
yourself, you know that?

16:20.748 --> 16:23.332
Where do you think they get it?

16:23.417 --> 16:25.617
- I don't know.
- Well, I do.

16:25.703 --> 16:29.288
They're lucky to have you, Liz.

16:30.791 --> 16:33.675
How did it go at the
station with Kyle's things?

16:37.014 --> 16:37.963
Fine.

16:38.015 --> 16:40.799
You can talk to me about him, you know.

16:42.186 --> 16:43.185
I can't.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.438
I'm sorry.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.307
Okay.

16:49.893 --> 16:51.393
I'm here if you need me.

16:55.699 --> 16:56.865
Listen.

17:00.321 --> 17:02.120
What do you think about having Gabe

17:02.156 --> 17:03.822
stay here for a little while?

17:03.874 --> 17:07.041
The kids say that he doesn't
want to go to his relatives,

17:07.127 --> 17:08.827
and I'm worried about him.

17:08.912 --> 17:11.128
He needs our support.

17:11.165 --> 17:16.385
I think that's a really nice thought.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.086
You'd be okay with it?

17:18.172 --> 17:22.674
If that's what you need, sure.

17:22.726 --> 17:25.176
Thank you.

17:32.519 --> 17:35.737
No way, man. Diane Banks?

17:35.823 --> 17:36.772
Showed up at my door last night

17:36.857 --> 17:38.523
right after you guys left.

17:38.575 --> 17:40.575
Dude, she is smoking hot.

17:40.661 --> 17:41.910
Ridiculous.

17:41.995 --> 17:43.195
What'd she want?

17:43.247 --> 17:45.030
She just wanted to see
if she could do anything

17:45.115 --> 17:46.448
to help me get through this tough time.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.699
And did she?

17:47.785 --> 17:49.835
Did she what?

17:49.870 --> 17:51.953
You know, do anything

17:52.039 --> 17:53.588
to help you through this tough time?

17:53.674 --> 17:56.425
- Yeah.
- Twice.

17:58.679 --> 18:01.213
What?

18:03.517 --> 18:07.135
Well, I know I'm not nearly

18:07.221 --> 18:10.021
as exciting a houseguest as Diane Banks,

18:10.057 --> 18:12.557
but if you want, I
could crash here tonight,

18:12.609 --> 18:13.608
if you want some company.

18:13.694 --> 18:15.227
Thanks. I'm good.

18:15.312 --> 18:16.445
Okay.

18:17.898 --> 18:20.232
You know, also I was talking to my mom

18:20.284 --> 18:22.234
and she said you could stay with us

18:22.319 --> 18:24.736
for however long, if you want.

18:24.822 --> 18:27.906
Hey, I appreciate that, man. I really do.

18:27.958 --> 18:30.325
But I'm doing okay here, you know?

18:30.411 --> 18:33.044
I miss my dad.

18:33.080 --> 18:36.298
I feel like he could come walking through

18:36.383 --> 18:39.801
the door any minute.

18:39.887 --> 18:42.504
It's like it really hasn't
hit me yet or something.

18:42.589 --> 18:46.141
But I'm okay, you know,
I just gotta keep going.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.676
Yeah.

18:47.761 --> 18:48.927
But you know, at some point...

18:48.979 --> 18:52.013
At some point, what?

18:52.099 --> 18:54.599
You don't know what's gonna happen, okay?

18:54.651 --> 18:56.902
I mean, unless you're some kind
of professional grief counselor

18:56.937 --> 18:58.653
- and I didn't know.
- No, I'm not.

18:58.739 --> 19:01.356
Okay, then, let's drop it.

19:04.194 --> 19:05.444
Look, it's getting late.

19:05.529 --> 19:08.163
I think Diane's gonna
come back over, soon, so.

19:08.248 --> 19:11.533
Okay, well, I'll stop by tomorrow.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.201
It's cool, you don't have to.

19:23.347 --> 19:25.180
Hey. Hey.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.299
I put your clothes in your room.

19:27.384 --> 19:29.601
Thanks.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.386
How you doing?

19:33.273 --> 19:36.107
Yeah, I'm good, I'm just kind of nervous.

19:36.143 --> 19:39.528
Mmm.

19:39.613 --> 19:42.864
This helps with nervous.

19:42.950 --> 19:44.316
Thank you.

19:45.819 --> 19:46.985
Madame.

19:48.622 --> 19:49.538
Hey, girls.

19:49.623 --> 19:50.989
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:51.074 --> 19:53.959
Ice cream. What's the occasion?

19:53.994 --> 19:56.828
We are feeding our
anxiety with sugar and fat.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.164
I'm in.

20:01.084 --> 20:02.667
Everything's gonna be fine tomorrow.

20:02.719 --> 20:05.036
You know just what to say.

20:05.105 --> 20:06.671
Yeah, I guess.

20:06.740 --> 20:07.973
I just feels kind of strange

20:08.008 --> 20:09.307
that I'm the one that
has to put her in jail

20:09.343 --> 20:10.642
after all of this.

20:10.677 --> 20:13.512
If I could take this away
from you, Carter, I would.

20:14.982 --> 20:16.398
You know that, right?

20:18.402 --> 20:20.068
Yeah, I do.

20:20.153 --> 20:22.354
That's what makes you my mom.

20:34.687 --> 20:36.103
Come in.

20:37.657 --> 20:39.156
Hey. Hey, you're back.

20:39.242 --> 20:40.608
Am I interrupting? No.

20:40.693 --> 20:42.443
Just a little band practice.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.281
I brought you a housewarming gift.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.332
What is it?

20:48.417 --> 20:51.418
It's a crock pot. What does it look like?

20:51.454 --> 20:53.020
Mmm, thank you.

20:53.089 --> 20:55.172
I know you like to grow stuff.

20:56.626 --> 20:57.625
What's up?

20:57.710 --> 21:00.010
Uh...

21:00.096 --> 21:02.930
I was just at home

21:02.965 --> 21:05.800
trying not to think about tomorrow.

21:05.852 --> 21:07.768
And then I went into my room

21:07.804 --> 21:12.439
and started thinking about tomorrow.

21:12.475 --> 21:13.858
Yeah.

21:13.943 --> 21:16.610
You know, I've been putting
on this show for everyone

21:16.646 --> 21:20.030
like I'm ready to take whatever comes,

21:20.116 --> 21:21.398
fight the good fight,

21:21.484 --> 21:26.036
but I don't know.

21:26.122 --> 21:28.489
And then I was... I was thinking about

21:28.574 --> 21:30.157
what you said,

21:30.209 --> 21:35.246
about me coming here if
I ever needed anything,

21:35.331 --> 21:38.549
so I got in my car and here I am.

21:39.836 --> 21:42.803
I don't want to go, Max.

21:42.839 --> 21:44.171
I'm scared.

21:46.259 --> 21:48.425
Is it okay if I stay with you?

21:48.511 --> 21:50.594
Yeah.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.062
Yeah, of course you can.

21:52.148 --> 21:54.398
In the morning, I'll make you some waffles

21:54.483 --> 21:56.517
in my new crock pot.

21:58.104 --> 22:01.488
And I'll go with you.

22:01.524 --> 22:02.740
If you don't want to stay, you know,

22:02.825 --> 22:04.108
I can take you home, too.

22:04.193 --> 22:05.860
- You will?
- Mm-hmm.

22:05.912 --> 22:08.162
Whatever you need.

22:08.197 --> 22:11.749
Always, you know that.

22:28.384 --> 22:29.683
Hi, Gabe.

22:29.719 --> 22:31.385
Hi.

22:31.470 --> 22:33.387
Can I come in?

22:33.439 --> 22:35.639
Sure.

22:43.566 --> 22:45.282
You alone?

22:46.535 --> 22:50.487
Yeah, finally got rid of the relatives.

22:50.573 --> 22:51.872
Well, are you hungry?

22:51.908 --> 22:54.575
You want me to make you something?

22:54.627 --> 22:57.127
No, I'm good.

22:59.916 --> 23:01.548
Um...

23:01.584 --> 23:05.002
I have some stuff for you from the station.

23:05.087 --> 23:06.921
Thanks.

23:07.006 --> 23:10.090
I'll just...

23:16.732 --> 23:17.815
Can we talk a second?

23:17.900 --> 23:20.017
I'm kind of in the thick of it.

23:20.102 --> 23:21.101
Oh, right.

23:21.187 --> 23:24.321
Maybe later.

23:25.608 --> 23:27.441
We really don't need to do this.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.826
Do what?

23:28.911 --> 23:30.110
I'm okay.

23:30.196 --> 23:31.612
Really?

23:31.697 --> 23:33.948
Yes.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.200
Because I'm worried about you, Gabe.

23:36.285 --> 23:38.118
I just wanted to let you know

23:38.204 --> 23:41.922
that you can come to me for anything.

23:41.958 --> 23:43.290
If you need anything...

23:43.376 --> 23:46.176
If you want to come and stay with us,

23:46.262 --> 23:48.679
something to eat.

23:48.764 --> 23:52.132
If you want some advice or a hug, just...

23:52.184 --> 23:53.517
All you have to do is...

23:53.602 --> 23:54.635
What?

23:56.472 --> 23:58.355
Ask?

23:59.475 --> 24:00.641
Thanks a lot.

24:00.693 --> 24:02.276
Now that he's gone,

24:02.311 --> 24:05.145
you're finally ready to be my mom?

24:05.197 --> 24:07.481
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

24:07.533 --> 24:10.401
to be honest, when he was here,

24:10.486 --> 24:13.404
you weren't too interested in our family.

24:21.580 --> 24:23.330
Gabe, I am so sorry.

24:23.416 --> 24:25.215
I don't need your apologies.

24:26.669 --> 24:28.719
Or your advice.

24:32.174 --> 24:33.590
But thanks for the memories.

24:49.827 --> 24:51.794
You ready?

24:51.829 --> 24:54.129
Yeah.

24:54.165 --> 24:56.381
Uh, what do you think?

24:56.467 --> 24:58.500
I'm going for maternal.

24:58.586 --> 25:01.670
You are maternal, three times over.

25:02.890 --> 25:05.557
Gabe doesn't think so.

25:05.643 --> 25:08.277
Your motherhood is not on trial today.

25:08.345 --> 25:10.095
Yeah, well, in my experience,

25:10.181 --> 25:12.397
the jury puts whatever
they want to on trial.

25:13.767 --> 25:18.687
You are the most devoted,
loving parent I know.

25:21.192 --> 25:22.357
Let's hope that's enough.

26:04.235 --> 26:05.567
Hey.

26:05.653 --> 26:08.287
Hey.

26:10.741 --> 26:12.491
Gabe, you're here.

26:12.576 --> 26:13.876
Hi, Mrs. Ellis. Thanks for letting me stay.

26:26.924 --> 26:28.056
I'm here.

26:44.992 --> 26:46.325
Hey.

27:13.304 --> 27:15.053
Are you okay?

27:15.139 --> 27:16.188
Yeah, it's just...

27:16.273 --> 27:18.056
I've never seen her before.

27:22.062 --> 27:24.980
All rise. Court is now in session.

27:25.032 --> 27:28.233
The Honorable Judge Nadine Pryor presiding.

27:36.377 --> 27:37.326
There you are.

27:37.378 --> 27:38.827
What's up?

27:38.879 --> 27:41.880
I just thought you might
like to come shopping with me.

27:41.966 --> 27:42.914
No, thanks.

27:44.168 --> 27:45.584
I'll be home at 6:00.

27:45.669 --> 27:47.970
The Gibsons are expecting us for dinner.

27:48.005 --> 27:49.087
Please be ready.

27:49.173 --> 27:52.424
And wear something appropriate.

27:52.509 --> 27:54.343
Looks like you're almost ready.

27:54.428 --> 27:55.427
Do you need a ride, dear?

27:55.512 --> 27:56.511
No, she doesn't

27:56.563 --> 27:59.598
and if she does, I'll give her one.

27:59.683 --> 28:00.932
Please watch your tone.

28:01.018 --> 28:02.734
That car you're driving was a gift.

28:02.820 --> 28:04.853
- It can easily be taken away.
- Fine.

28:04.938 --> 28:06.021
Take it. Okay?

28:06.106 --> 28:07.773
I don't care what you do to me.

28:07.858 --> 28:10.075
I've been fending for
myself and living on my own

28:10.160 --> 28:11.743
and doing just fine,

28:11.829 --> 28:15.947
with a lot of people around
that care about me, okay?

28:16.033 --> 28:17.249
I'm going.

28:17.334 --> 28:22.120
We will discuss boundary
adjustments later, young lady.

28:26.427 --> 28:28.126
You're cute when you're mad.

28:28.212 --> 28:29.211
Thanks.

28:29.296 --> 28:32.047
Come on, let's put your stuff back.

28:32.132 --> 28:33.215
No, Bird.

28:33.267 --> 28:36.551
I really do have to go.

28:37.388 --> 28:38.804
I know this sounds insane,

28:38.889 --> 28:42.274
but seeing your parents
kind of made me miss mine.

28:42.359 --> 28:44.526
You mean seeing my lousy parents

28:44.561 --> 28:46.228
made you miss your lousy parents?

28:46.280 --> 28:47.779
Exactly.

28:49.199 --> 28:52.067
And...

28:52.152 --> 28:55.570
I just think I've done enough damage here.

28:55.656 --> 28:57.456
I think Carter and I are really done now.

28:57.541 --> 28:59.458
Maybe she just needs some time.

28:59.543 --> 29:01.076
No, I think it's over.

29:02.796 --> 29:04.880
Maybe you'll come visit me.

29:04.915 --> 29:06.581
Sure, I'll try.

29:06.667 --> 29:08.500
Well, how about a kiss for the road?

29:21.065 --> 29:23.765
Carter, can you tell the
jury what your relationship

29:23.851 --> 29:27.602
is to the defendant, Lori Stevens?

29:27.688 --> 29:29.738
Yeah, she's my kidnapper.

29:29.773 --> 29:32.858
And how old were you when
Miss Stevens kidnapped you?

29:32.943 --> 29:34.659
The first time, I was three.

29:34.745 --> 29:35.694
But this recent time,

29:35.779 --> 29:37.779
the second time she took you,

29:37.865 --> 29:40.582
did Miss Stevens drug you
before she abducted you?

29:40.617 --> 29:42.667
- Yes.
- Did she force you into a car,

29:42.753 --> 29:44.336
hold you in a motel against your will

29:44.421 --> 29:47.122
and then transport you to a second location

29:47.174 --> 29:50.792
in order for Miss Stevens to
try and abduct your sister?

29:50.844 --> 29:51.877
Yes.

29:51.962 --> 29:53.545
Were you aware during this kidnapping

29:53.630 --> 29:55.213
that your assailant had a gun?

29:55.299 --> 29:56.631
Yeah, I was.

29:56.683 --> 29:58.100
Did she threaten you with that gun?

29:58.135 --> 30:00.135
She used it to make sure I wouldn't run.

30:00.220 --> 30:03.138
Objection, Your Honor,
witness is speculating.

30:03.223 --> 30:06.108
Sustained. Jury will disregard the answer.

30:06.143 --> 30:08.026
Counselor, continue.

30:08.112 --> 30:10.061
Carter, who gave birth to you?

30:10.147 --> 30:11.363
Elizabeth Wilson.

30:11.448 --> 30:13.482
And what is your relationship
to Elizabeth Wilson?

30:13.534 --> 30:14.900
She's my mother.

30:14.985 --> 30:17.953
And once more, just for the record, Carter.

30:17.988 --> 30:20.822
What is your relationship to Lori Stevens?

30:20.874 --> 30:23.325
She is the woman who kidnapped me.

30:23.377 --> 30:25.994
And do you have any other
relationship to the defendant?

30:26.079 --> 30:28.296
No. None.

30:28.332 --> 30:31.583
And finally, will you
please state for the jury

30:31.668 --> 30:33.168
the name that you choose to go by?

30:33.253 --> 30:36.588
I have decided to go by
Wilson, Carter Wilson.

30:36.673 --> 30:37.672
It's my legal name.

30:37.758 --> 30:41.259
That's all, Your Honor.

30:57.694 --> 31:00.862
Looks like you need a time out.

31:00.948 --> 31:03.198
I get it, I've been there.

31:05.536 --> 31:07.502
I'm fine, thanks.

31:07.538 --> 31:09.037
Courtrooms are pretty intense.

31:09.122 --> 31:10.789
Know a lot about courtrooms, do you?

31:10.874 --> 31:13.208
Yeah, well, I've been in and
out of them my whole life, so.

31:13.293 --> 31:15.427
You look a little young to be a lawyer.

31:15.512 --> 31:16.795
I do, right?

31:16.880 --> 31:18.430
It's a great strategy, actually.

31:18.515 --> 31:19.598
Once the opposition sees

31:19.683 --> 31:20.882
that I'm not even old enough to drink,

31:20.968 --> 31:22.217
then they're thrown off their argument

31:22.302 --> 31:24.519
and I win the case.

31:24.555 --> 31:27.222
- Is that how it goes?
- Mm-hm.

31:27.274 --> 31:28.890
You just have to know how the system works.

31:28.942 --> 31:30.058
You know, not to brag or anything,

31:30.143 --> 31:32.644
but I've been doing this for 16 years,

31:32.729 --> 31:35.947
so I am pretty much an expert at it.

31:36.033 --> 31:38.066
- Not to brag or anything.
- No.

31:38.118 --> 31:40.202
No, I'm... I'm just telling the truth,

31:40.237 --> 31:42.120
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

31:43.407 --> 31:44.456
Right.

31:44.541 --> 31:46.908
So, this is the part where I ask you

31:46.960 --> 31:48.210
what you're doing here.

31:48.245 --> 31:50.412
Carter Wilson, they're ready for you.

31:53.550 --> 31:56.968
Well, maybe next time.

32:04.428 --> 32:07.062
Miss Wilson,

32:07.097 --> 32:09.481
is it true that you and the defendant

32:09.566 --> 32:12.067
lived together for 13 of your 17 years?

32:12.102 --> 32:13.151
Yes.

32:13.237 --> 32:15.270
During that time, was your relationship

32:15.322 --> 32:16.905
with the defendant a contentious one?

32:16.940 --> 32:19.157
No, but I was living in complete ignorance.

32:19.243 --> 32:21.610
Was it, in fact, a loving relationship?

32:21.695 --> 32:23.111
Depends on your definition of love.

32:23.196 --> 32:24.613
Did you ever tell the defendant

32:24.698 --> 32:26.031
that you loved her?

32:28.619 --> 32:29.751
Yeah, I did.

32:29.786 --> 32:31.119
Miss Wilson, was there, in fact,

32:31.171 --> 32:35.206
a phrase that you and the defendant

32:35.292 --> 32:38.376
said to each other about how
much you loved each other.

32:38.462 --> 32:39.761
Yeah, there was.

32:39.796 --> 32:42.464
It's a bit of a back and forth.

32:42.516 --> 32:43.498
A private phrase, correct?

32:43.567 --> 32:44.733
Yep.

32:44.801 --> 32:46.301
So if you said to the defendant,

32:46.353 --> 32:47.385
"I love you,"

32:47.471 --> 32:51.273
what would she say back?

32:51.341 --> 32:53.341
She would say, "I love you more."

32:53.410 --> 32:54.776
And how would you respond?

32:54.811 --> 32:56.811
"Not possible."

32:56.897 --> 32:58.697
And then she would say...

33:01.652 --> 33:02.984
"Yes possible."

33:13.818 --> 33:15.051
Miss Wilson,

33:15.120 --> 33:17.070
could you describe for the jury

33:17.155 --> 33:20.023
what your 13 years with Lori were like.

33:20.075 --> 33:22.942
Normal, I guess.

33:23.028 --> 33:23.910
Could you be a bit more specific?

33:23.995 --> 33:25.111
What do you want me to say?

33:25.196 --> 33:26.946
Yeah, she... she fed me, she clothed me,

33:27.032 --> 33:28.031
she took me to school.

33:28.083 --> 33:29.916
And this, "love you, love you more"

33:30.001 --> 33:31.167
word game you played,

33:31.202 --> 33:32.452
do you think she really loved you?

33:32.537 --> 33:34.754
That's completely subjective.

33:34.839 --> 33:35.955
No, not really.

33:36.041 --> 33:38.791
As a child, did you feel loved?

33:38.877 --> 33:42.295
- Yes.
- Was she kind to you?

33:42.380 --> 33:44.047
Again, that is completely subjective.

33:44.099 --> 33:46.049
I'm just trying to classify
what kind of mother she was.

33:46.101 --> 33:47.800
She wasn't my mother.

33:47.886 --> 33:48.935
But you thought she was.

33:49.020 --> 33:51.220
Yes, okay? I thought she was.

33:51.306 --> 33:52.722
Because I was being tricked,

33:52.807 --> 33:56.059
and if you really want to play this game,

33:56.144 --> 33:59.062
then, yeah, she loved me.

33:59.114 --> 34:01.531
I really think that she did.

34:01.566 --> 34:05.234
She took me on adventures,
she took me to the dentist.

34:05.287 --> 34:08.404
She treated me as if I was the
absolute center of her universe.

34:08.489 --> 34:12.574
She gave me confidence,
read to me, was kind to me.

34:12.661 --> 34:16.545
She did absolutely everything
a mother is supposed to do.

34:16.581 --> 34:18.797
I thought she was my mother
and she acted like my mother.

34:20.635 --> 34:23.585
But nothing you have me say right now

34:23.638 --> 34:25.138
is going to change the fact

34:25.223 --> 34:27.139
that that is the woman who kidnapped me

34:27.225 --> 34:29.891
from my real parents when I was three,

34:29.928 --> 34:31.177
only to drug me

34:31.262 --> 34:34.097
and do the exact same thing 13 years later.

34:34.181 --> 34:35.931
She is a criminal and
that's all that matters here.

34:36.016 --> 34:37.567
Miss Wilson,

34:37.601 --> 34:41.187
did you recently find out
that Lori Stevens is, in fact,

34:41.272 --> 34:43.822
your biological mother?

34:43.908 --> 34:45.858
She is the egg donor,
that is very different.

34:45.944 --> 34:49.245
Would you say that someone
that shares your biology,

34:49.280 --> 34:50.697
feeds you, clothes you,

34:50.782 --> 34:53.449
provides a roof over your head,

34:53.501 --> 34:56.085
and loves you more than
anything else in the world

34:56.121 --> 34:57.670
could be called a parent?

34:57.756 --> 34:59.789
A lot of people provide
support to children.

34:59.874 --> 35:01.124
It doesn't necessarily mean
they're all the parents.

35:01.176 --> 35:02.508
Answer the question, please.

35:02.594 --> 35:04.627
Would you consider a
person who did all that

35:04.679 --> 35:08.798
for their biological child a parent?

35:10.218 --> 35:11.384
Yes or no, please.

35:11.469 --> 35:14.437
Yes, but that's not the point here.

35:14.472 --> 35:16.522
Actually, that is the point.

35:16.608 --> 35:18.441
Not whether she made mistakes.

35:18.476 --> 35:21.778
But whether she was your parent.

35:21.813 --> 35:23.312
She wasn't my parent.

35:23.365 --> 35:24.364
Did you recently go
visit her in the hospital

35:24.449 --> 35:25.698
when she was ill?

35:25.784 --> 35:27.483
Yeah, she told me she wanted me to leave

35:27.569 --> 35:29.402
and she never wanted to see me again.

35:29.487 --> 35:31.371
But before that, you...
you had a conversation.

35:31.456 --> 35:33.039
Yeah, we had a conversation.

35:33.124 --> 35:34.490
Tell me about that.

35:34.576 --> 35:36.909
What condition was she
in when you got there?

35:36.995 --> 35:38.578
I don't know, quiet.

35:38.663 --> 35:40.463
Would you say she was depressed?

35:40.498 --> 35:42.331
I don't know, I'm not a doctor.

35:42.384 --> 35:46.169
Was it difficult seeing
her in that condition?

35:46.254 --> 35:48.554
Yeah.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.723
What did you say to her, specifically?

35:50.809 --> 35:52.008
I don't remember.

35:52.093 --> 35:56.512
Did you say something to the effect of...

35:58.683 --> 36:01.601
"That our life together wasn't a mistake"?

36:05.857 --> 36:07.440
Yeah What else did you say?

36:07.525 --> 36:11.244
Tell the jury what you said, Miss Wilson.

36:11.329 --> 36:12.695
If you don't, I can read it out loud.

36:12.781 --> 36:17.533
I told her that there was a point at which

36:17.619 --> 36:19.836
she was my mother,

36:19.871 --> 36:25.291
that she loved me and took care of me.

36:25.376 --> 36:28.928
That I loved her and I always would.

36:30.548 --> 36:35.268
Was this woman, in fact, your mother not?

36:40.942 --> 36:41.941
Maybe.

36:42.026 --> 36:44.977
Is there any part of
you that still loves her?

36:47.949 --> 36:50.366
Yes.

36:50.401 --> 36:52.068
No further questions.

37:03.998 --> 37:05.915
The court will now take a short recess.

37:12.674 --> 37:15.258
It's fine. Everything is going to be okay.

37:15.310 --> 37:17.260
I just ruined everything.

37:17.312 --> 37:19.812
You told the truth.
You did the right thing.

37:19.898 --> 37:22.064
Yeah, but now she might get out.

37:22.100 --> 37:23.432
It doesn't matter, Carter.

37:24.769 --> 37:26.435
- We're still a family.
- Yeah.

37:40.251 --> 37:42.118
Defense, you may call your first witness.

37:42.170 --> 37:43.669
Thank you, Your Honor.

37:43.755 --> 37:47.039
I call to the stand Benjamin Wallace.

38:02.774 --> 38:04.223
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,

38:04.309 --> 38:05.975
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

38:06.027 --> 38:07.059
I do.

38:15.069 --> 38:18.237
Will you please state
your name for the record?

38:18.323 --> 38:21.073
Ben Wallace. Benjamin.

38:21.159 --> 38:22.375
Would you please tell the jury

38:22.460 --> 38:25.628
your connection to the
defendant, Lori Stevens.

38:25.663 --> 38:28.881
Lori Stevens is my biological mother.

38:28.967 --> 38:33.553
And who, for the record,
is your biological father?

38:34.756 --> 38:37.006
Uh, my biological father is David Wilson.

38:51.438 --> 38:53.290
