WEBVTT

00:44.532 --> 00:46.500
They ought to make
the day the time changes

00:46.534 --> 00:47.870
the first day of summer.

00:47.903 --> 00:49.503
What?

00:49.537 --> 00:51.405
Well it's eight
o'clock and it's still light.

00:51.439 --> 00:54.008
Lot of good the
extra daylight does us.

00:54.041 --> 00:55.943
Now we still got a
three hour drive back,

00:55.977 --> 00:58.045
we're not gonna be home
until after midnight.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.614
You wouldn't do it.

01:00.647 --> 01:01.615
You think I
want to blow a Sunday

01:01.648 --> 01:03.516
on a scene like this?

01:03.550 --> 01:05.452
You know, I think that
we're either gonna have

01:05.485 --> 01:08.288
to put mother out here or move
the grave into Pittsburgh.

01:08.321 --> 01:10.556
She can't
make a trip like this.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.552
Coming back on the air

01:43.586 --> 01:45.421
after an interruption due
to technical problems.

01:57.465 --> 01:58.600
Nothing
wrong with the radio.

01:58.633 --> 02:00.502
Must of been the station.

02:00.535 --> 02:02.437
Which row is it in?

02:48.880 --> 02:49.848
Damn kids.

03:00.757 --> 03:02.226
I hate Halloween.

03:23.278 --> 03:24.545
Do you
remember one time

03:24.579 --> 03:26.915
when we were small,
we were out here.

03:26.949 --> 03:28.583
It was from right over there.

03:28.616 --> 03:30.650
I jumped out at you
from behind the tree

03:30.684 --> 03:32.220
and Grandpa got all excited

03:32.253 --> 03:33.520
and he shook his fist at me

03:33.553 --> 03:35.689
and he said, "Boy, you'll
be damned to hell."

03:36.757 --> 03:37.492
Remember that?

03:37.557 --> 03:38.592
Right over there.

03:38.625 --> 03:41.695
You used to really be scared.

03:41.728 --> 03:43.562
Johnny.

03:43.596 --> 03:45.265
You're still afraid.

03:46.466 --> 03:48.969
Stop
it now, I mean it.

03:51.570 --> 03:54.407
They're coming
to get you Barbra.

03:56.442 --> 03:57.443
Stop it.

03:57.476 --> 03:58.710
You're ignorant.

03:58.743 --> 04:00.880
They're
coming for you, Barbra.

04:00.913 --> 04:03.681
Stop it, you're
acting like a child.

04:03.715 --> 04:07.185
They're
coming for you.

04:07.218 --> 04:08.719
Look, there comes
one of them know.

04:11.489 --> 04:12.556
I'm getting out of here.

04:12.589 --> 04:13.791
Johnny.

04:21.631 --> 04:23.367
Johnny, help me!

04:58.265 --> 04:59.567
Sorry, Dad.

04:59.599 --> 05:00.901
I know I'm a little late.

05:00.935 --> 05:03.003
We had a group of
college kids walk in

05:03.037 --> 05:04.671
20 minutes before closing.

05:07.639 --> 05:09.641
Look, I know you hate Halloween.

05:09.675 --> 05:11.643
But I wish you wouldn't
be such a bummer.

05:11.677 --> 05:14.514
At least pass out all
the candy I bought.

05:17.950 --> 05:18.683

you a little scared?

09:05.092 --> 09:07.795
It's a little hard to be
scared of a hockey mask.

09:07.827 --> 09:08.828
What about Jason?

09:08.861 --> 09:11.731
Jason doesn't wear
princess sneakers.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.368
But.

09:15.401 --> 09:16.202
Mommy.

09:19.004 --> 09:20.038
Hi, hey baby.

09:21.373 --> 09:22.240
You missed it.

09:22.274 --> 09:23.842
I totally just scared Laurie.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.812
You did, did you?

09:25.844 --> 09:26.712
Oh yeah.

09:26.745 --> 09:27.879
She screamed bloody murder.

09:29.047 --> 09:30.816
Why is this place
such a disaster?

09:30.848 --> 09:33.017
It's complete chaos.

09:33.050 --> 09:36.587
I can't get either of them
to do any of their chores.

09:37.755 --> 09:38.824
Thanks.

09:38.856 --> 09:40.558
And what about your chores?

09:40.591 --> 09:42.058
Uh well, if they
don't do theirs

09:42.092 --> 09:43.259
I shouldn't have to do mine.

09:43.293 --> 09:44.094
It's only fair.

09:48.231 --> 09:50.934
Ever think about
leading by example?

09:52.268 --> 09:54.903
Hey, that's my breakfast.

09:54.937 --> 09:56.338
Is this the kind
of crap you guys eat

09:56.372 --> 09:58.040
when I'm not around?

09:58.073 --> 09:58.941
You heard, Mom.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.409
This crap is not good for you.

10:03.879 --> 10:04.880
What?

10:04.913 --> 10:05.848
Why is always me?

10:05.880 --> 10:07.850
What about Tweedledee
and Tweedledum?

10:07.882 --> 10:09.183
I'm offended.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.052
I am not dumb.

10:11.085 --> 10:12.954
Of course you're not, honey.

10:14.489 --> 10:15.456
I just feel like everything

10:15.490 --> 10:17.024
is always put onto my shoulders.

10:17.058 --> 10:18.625
I didn't ask to be the oldest.

10:18.658 --> 10:20.026
Well, you are the oldest

10:20.060 --> 10:22.963
and I need you to step up
for the next two nights.

10:22.996 --> 10:25.899
Wait, the next two nights?

10:25.932 --> 10:27.634
I had to pick up
the next two nights.

10:27.667 --> 10:30.636
Mom, Halloween is tomorrow
and I already have plans.

10:30.669 --> 10:31.937
I don't want to be stuck

10:31.971 --> 10:33.038
at home looking
after these dimwits.

10:33.072 --> 10:34.640
You won't be stuck at home.

10:34.673 --> 10:36.609
You'll be taking your
sister trick or treating.

10:37.910 --> 10:39.111
Is that his project?

10:39.145 --> 10:40.446
Yeah, it's due today.

10:40.479 --> 10:43.281
He's been on it
24/7 with Pork Chop.

10:43.314 --> 10:44.482
You mean Lawrence?

10:45.316 --> 10:46.886
How's he doing?

10:46.918 --> 10:49.087
Father Justice Martinez
wrote in his journal

10:49.120 --> 10:51.156
about a pack of mountain devils.

10:51.189 --> 10:52.757
Devils.

10:52.792 --> 10:55.092
Slaughtering his
entire wagon train.

11:32.693 --> 11:33.661
Oh no.

11:33.694 --> 11:34.495
Help!

11:42.168 --> 11:43.169
Let it go.

12:02.154 --> 12:04.156
Little fuck got away.

12:04.189 --> 12:04.958
No he didn't.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.524
Come on.

12:24.007 --> 12:24.775
Come on

12:32.248 --> 12:35.351
Where the fuck are
you, little bitch?

12:47.729 --> 12:51.432
Swear that kids gonna
eat my dirt tonight.

13:31.135 --> 13:32.169
Hey.

13:33.604 --> 13:34.538
What are you doing back there?

13:34.572 --> 13:36.574
I, I, I was hiding.

13:42.012 --> 13:43.346
From those guys in the van?

13:44.280 --> 13:45.049
Yeah.

13:45.081 --> 13:46.215
Why?

13:46.249 --> 13:48.117
I was at the Diablo's Den...

13:48.151 --> 13:49.118
Diablo's Den?

13:49.152 --> 13:50.553
What are you doing up there?

13:50.587 --> 13:52.689
I was grabbing some
establishing shots.

13:53.990 --> 13:54.791
What?

14:01.496 --> 14:04.099
I'm doing a documentary
on Diablo's Den for school.

14:06.267 --> 14:07.301
See.

14:09.136 --> 14:11.138
Aren't you scared
of who's up there?

14:11.974 --> 14:13.207
Who's up there?

14:14.275 --> 14:15.676
Bloody Bobby.

14:17.111 --> 14:18.511
Bloody Bobby?

14:22.449 --> 14:23.683
Well they're gone now.

14:24.885 --> 14:29.154
Yeah, I better get going.

14:29.188 --> 14:30.991
Thank you for not killing me.

14:32.191 --> 14:32.993
Listen.

14:34.159 --> 14:35.194
Watch your back and
be extra careful

14:35.227 --> 14:36.528
the next couple of days.

14:37.730 --> 14:39.264
You never know who
or what's gonna come

14:39.298 --> 14:40.800
out of the shadows on Halloween,

14:40.834 --> 14:42.333
especially in Fall Creek Valley.

14:45.037 --> 14:45.804
Okay, Pork Chop.

14:45.838 --> 14:48.040
Just get up and shut up.

14:50.675 --> 14:53.543
Keep walking, get on
your bike, ride home

14:53.577 --> 14:56.446
before you end up in some
creepy guy's basement.

14:56.480 --> 14:57.247
Bye.

15:15.431 --> 15:17.198
How can we not find the
fattest fucking kid ever?

15:17.232 --> 15:18.868
Seriously, man.

15:40.789 --> 15:41.755
Let's go, baby.

15:41.789 --> 15:43.356
I'm hungry for a pork chop.

16:00.205 --> 16:01.440
Well, well, well.

16:01.473 --> 16:03.341
Looks like lard ass
had a little accident.

16:03.375 --> 16:04.143
No.

16:05.376 --> 16:06.310
Did you just piss yourself?

16:07.545 --> 16:09.480
No, it's from a
puddle, butt breath.

16:10.982 --> 16:12.616
You can't stop running
that mouth of yours, can ya?

16:12.650 --> 16:15.386
Tons of fun here is
trying to be funny.

16:15.419 --> 16:17.088
How many times do
I have to tell you

16:17.121 --> 16:18.388
to stop spying on us?

16:18.421 --> 16:19.656
I wasn't spying.

16:20.825 --> 16:21.624
Then what were
you doing up there?

16:21.658 --> 16:22.927
Your mom.

16:25.228 --> 16:26.262
You fat little.

16:30.432 --> 16:31.467
Those assholes.

16:32.836 --> 16:34.104
Let him go!

16:34.137 --> 16:35.839
Oh you cum buckets
are gonna get it now.

16:37.272 --> 16:38.741
Laurie, you live here?

16:38.775 --> 16:41.409
And Pork Chop is a
friend of my brothers.

16:41.442 --> 16:42.443
- Yeah!
- We were just messing

16:42.477 --> 16:44.278
with him, like boys being boys.

16:44.312 --> 16:47.248
Looks like a couple
of dick less douche bags

16:47.281 --> 16:49.450
working through some
childhood issues.

16:50.685 --> 16:51.787
Hey,
I'm not dick less.

16:51.820 --> 16:52.755
Not you, sweetie.

16:53.955 --> 16:55.322
You got it all
wrong, beautiful.

16:55.355 --> 16:57.225
Lawrence here is our bro.

16:57.257 --> 17:00.260
Yeah a brother
from another mother.

17:00.293 --> 17:01.963
We were just playing with him.

17:02.797 --> 17:04.932
Weren't gonna hurt the kid.

17:04.966 --> 17:06.398
I'm sorry if it
seems I'm not listening

17:06.432 --> 17:10.503
it's just that bullshit
meter is ringing so loud

17:10.536 --> 17:12.371
it's making my ears bleed.

17:13.305 --> 17:15.075
Let's go.

17:15.108 --> 17:17.810
You mess with him,
you mess with me.

17:19.644 --> 17:20.445
Bye Lawrence.

17:24.150 --> 17:25.017
You okay?

17:28.286 --> 17:29.686
Thanks, Laurie.

17:31.655 --> 17:32.891
No problem, Pork Chop.

17:34.358 --> 17:36.293
How long have Ace and
Judd been picking on you?

17:36.326 --> 17:38.328
Everyday for the
past two years.

17:38.362 --> 17:39.496
Those assholes.

17:39.530 --> 17:41.165
And I think I pissed myself.

17:42.365 --> 17:45.836
In 1876, a missionary named
Father Justice Martinez.

17:45.869 --> 17:46.669
How do I look?

17:48.337 --> 17:51.041
Like you're sporting
a geriatric fall line.

17:51.074 --> 17:52.843
Don't worry, honey,
you're stuffs in the dryer.

17:52.876 --> 17:54.177
It will be ready soon.

17:54.210 --> 17:55.443
Good.

17:55.477 --> 17:56.179
That means you won't
smell like piss

17:56.212 --> 17:57.947
for the rest of the day.

17:57.980 --> 17:59.548
So what's this all about?

17:59.581 --> 18:00.883
Diablo's Den.

18:00.917 --> 18:02.151
Diablo's Den?

18:02.185 --> 18:03.485
Diablo's Den
has been the setting

18:03.518 --> 18:05.053
for pretty much tall
tale campfire story

18:05.086 --> 18:06.288
in Fall Creek Valley.

18:06.353 --> 18:09.490
It's this place up by
the hills in Burden Pass

18:09.523 --> 18:11.492
where all this crazy
shit's gone down.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.128
Hey,
watch your mouth.

18:13.161 --> 18:14.495
Sorry, Mom.

18:14.528 --> 18:18.398
Some believe it's an old
place for satanic rituals.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.668
Others believe it's a
haunted, unmarked burial site

18:21.701 --> 18:23.137
that's a gateway to hell.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.738
So Lawrence and I
decided to do our report

18:24.772 --> 18:27.208
on all the stories and
myths behind that place.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.810
Looks more like
Burkittsville, Maryland.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.078
Where?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.513
No, Burkittsville was
made up for the movie.

18:34.546 --> 18:36.548
Diablo's Den is real.

18:36.582 --> 18:37.884
Whatever, nerd.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.385
Hey, be nice.

18:40.419 --> 18:41.719
Okay, time to go.

18:41.753 --> 18:43.856
Regan, we're late.

18:43.889 --> 18:45.423
Leave the mask here.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.361
Shoo, come on, guys.

18:50.394 --> 18:51.830
Time for school.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.663
I need
to change my pants.

19:00.437 --> 19:03.040
You guys did a
great job with the decorations.

19:03.074 --> 19:04.275
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

19:04.308 --> 19:05.909
I think there's gonna
be some scared kids

19:05.942 --> 19:07.443
coming trick or
treating around here.

19:07.476 --> 19:08.945
That's the plan.

19:08.979 --> 19:10.579
So I talked to
your mom and she said

19:10.613 --> 19:12.916
you're gonna be spending
the weekend with us.

19:12.949 --> 19:14.550
Thanks, Mrs. Peterson.

19:14.583 --> 19:16.452
Oh, and honey just because
he's spending the weekend

19:16.485 --> 19:18.453
it's not gonna get you
out of mowing the lawn.

19:18.486 --> 19:20.455
I think the shaggy
lawn goes good

19:20.488 --> 19:22.057
with the Halloween decorations.

19:22.091 --> 19:24.960
Oh no, you are mowing
the lawn this weekend, sir.

19:24.994 --> 19:26.195
Fine.

19:26.228 --> 19:27.629
Okay, have a good day, guys.

19:27.662 --> 19:28.429
Bye, mom.

19:28.463 --> 19:29.463
Bye, Ms. Peterson.

19:29.496 --> 19:30.631
See you later.

19:30.664 --> 19:32.367
Laurie saved my ass today.

19:32.399 --> 19:33.400
So you owe her own.

19:33.433 --> 19:34.534
Me?

19:34.568 --> 19:35.602
You're the one she saved.

19:35.636 --> 19:37.471
You owe her, not me.

19:42.608 --> 19:43.377
Hey, ladies.

19:43.409 --> 19:44.745
So I am doing a

19:44.778 --> 19:46.046
- protest tomorrow night.
- I really like this one.

19:46.079 --> 19:47.413
- Sweetie, please.
- Before the dance

19:47.446 --> 19:48.581
and I was really wondering
if you guys could just,

19:48.614 --> 19:51.584
'cause I just think, whatever.

19:51.617 --> 19:53.753
Who pissed in your cup
of coffee this morning?

19:53.786 --> 19:56.454
It's just another
typical bullshit day

19:56.488 --> 19:58.157
in the life of Laurie Peterson.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.262
You better back off, okay?

20:03.296 --> 20:04.496
I meant what I said earlier.

20:04.529 --> 20:05.429
Sorry.

20:05.462 --> 20:06.597
I didn't know you knew him.

20:06.630 --> 20:07.631
Calm down, what happened?

20:07.665 --> 20:09.466
Yeah, don't get your
panties in a bunch.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.668
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

20:10.701 --> 20:11.970
It means that I
can't get that image

20:12.003 --> 20:14.438
of you in your panties
out of my head.

20:14.471 --> 20:15.472
Hey, beautiful.

20:15.506 --> 20:16.507
Hey.

20:16.540 --> 20:17.741
How you doing?

20:17.775 --> 20:19.509
What's going on?

20:19.542 --> 20:20.643
Nothing.

20:20.677 --> 20:21.912
Nothing?

20:21.946 --> 20:23.479
Laurie almost just
carved these guys up.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.515
No, it was just
a misunderstanding.

20:25.548 --> 20:26.516
Nothing to worry about.

20:26.549 --> 20:28.918
You see, my brother here
is kind of an idiot.

20:28.952 --> 20:31.520
Has a tendency to
say some dumb shit.

20:31.553 --> 20:33.455
What do you guys want?

20:33.488 --> 20:35.024
We wanted to see
if you guys want

20:35.058 --> 20:36.960
to go up to Diablo's
Den bonfire tonight.

20:36.993 --> 20:37.760
Tonight?

20:37.794 --> 20:38.527
Yeah.

20:38.560 --> 20:39.594
The game.

20:39.628 --> 20:40.696
Game?

20:40.730 --> 20:42.197
All you do is sit
on the bench, bro.

20:43.198 --> 20:44.132
Oh that's funny to you?

20:44.166 --> 20:44.933
You think this is for fashion?

20:44.967 --> 20:46.868
I'm hurt, asshole.

20:46.902 --> 20:47.668
Whatever.

20:47.702 --> 20:48.469
Pussy.

20:49.670 --> 20:51.306
How 'bout you, Laurie?

20:51.340 --> 20:52.640
I'm sorry.

20:52.673 --> 20:54.875
I'm just not really
interested in getting high

20:54.909 --> 20:57.144
with a couple of assholes.

20:57.178 --> 20:57.912
Good one.

20:59.646 --> 21:00.948
Don't look at me.

21:00.982 --> 21:02.482
I'll be doing anything
but going to Diablo's Den.

21:02.515 --> 21:05.352
You know I'm starting to think
you don't like me too much.

21:05.385 --> 21:07.553
Just now figuring this out?

21:07.586 --> 21:08.654
Well, I'm down.

21:08.687 --> 21:10.056
Seriously?

21:10.090 --> 21:11.157
What?

21:11.191 --> 21:12.658
What, it sounds like fun.

21:13.492 --> 21:14.493
And Phoebe's down, too.

21:16.229 --> 21:17.062
Sure.

21:17.096 --> 21:17.896
Why not?

21:19.597 --> 21:21.133
Well, whoever else
wants to join us tonight,

21:21.166 --> 21:23.501
you know where to find us.

21:26.571 --> 21:27.306
Toodles.

21:27.339 --> 21:28.639
Rather die.

21:28.673 --> 21:30.241
I really hate those
dick less douche bags.

21:30.274 --> 21:31.743
So annoying.

21:31.776 --> 21:33.643
You know you guys
have Judd all wrong.

21:33.677 --> 21:35.480
I've been tutoring
Judd in English.

21:35.512 --> 21:38.515
He isn't that much
of a Neanderthal.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.418
He's actually kind of smart.

21:40.451 --> 21:41.550
You can't be serious.

21:43.086 --> 21:45.422
Well, he's hot and he
definitely isn't dick less.

21:47.523 --> 21:49.692
I think she's banging
the dick less douche bag.

22:08.743 --> 22:09.911
What the hell?

22:19.953 --> 22:21.255
Phoebe!

22:24.224 --> 22:25.259
Stay out of my way next time

22:25.292 --> 22:26.060
Oh yeah?

22:26.093 --> 22:26.860
Yeah.

22:28.128 --> 22:29.028
Hey, cool off,
cool off, cool off.

22:29.062 --> 22:29.829
Cool off!

22:31.097 --> 22:32.465
You cool, Laurie?

22:32.498 --> 22:33.598
Are you?

22:35.567 --> 22:38.471
Have you decided what you
want to be for Halloween?

22:38.504 --> 22:40.972
Little Red Riding Hood
and the Big Bad Wolf.

22:41.006 --> 22:42.606
- So cute.
- I know.

22:45.676 --> 22:46.912
What's up your butt?

22:46.945 --> 22:49.580
You know that Halloween
is anti-Christian.

22:49.613 --> 22:50.581
So?

22:50.614 --> 22:51.615
So?

22:52.583 --> 22:53.884
Are you not worried
about your soul?

22:53.918 --> 22:55.886
Do you want to burn in hell?

22:55.920 --> 22:57.254
Yeah, actually I do.

23:00.357 --> 23:02.426
You're gonna drag
Flash down with you.

23:08.630 --> 23:11.768
Didn't you guys
used to be friends?

23:11.801 --> 23:14.270
Yeah, best friends.

23:14.304 --> 23:15.505
What happened?

23:15.538 --> 23:16.839
Isn't it obvious?

23:16.872 --> 23:18.807
Laurie started to hang
out with the popular kids.

23:20.542 --> 23:21.343
I'm with you.

23:25.981 --> 23:28.016
And to this day,
locals refer to this area

23:28.050 --> 23:30.151
as Diablo's Den.

23:30.184 --> 23:33.588
The most haunted landmark
in Fall Creek Valley.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.764
Good job, guys.

23:44.798 --> 23:47.134
But what is it with
the background?

23:47.167 --> 23:48.435
It's Diablo's Den.

23:48.468 --> 23:49.970
I know it's Diablo's Den.

23:50.003 --> 23:51.805
But what is it with
all the voodoo dolls

23:51.838 --> 23:52.872
hanging from the trees?

23:52.905 --> 23:54.206
Production value.

23:54.240 --> 23:55.941
Yeah, the combined
technical qualities

23:55.975 --> 23:59.178
of the methods, materials,
or stagecraft skills used

23:59.211 --> 24:01.679
in the production
of a motion picture

24:01.714 --> 24:03.048
or artistic performance.

24:03.082 --> 24:04.350
Production value.

24:04.383 --> 24:06.184
How did you get your
hands on a voodoo dolls?

24:06.217 --> 24:08.353
The art department.

24:08.386 --> 24:10.355
So Lawrence,
where did you obtain

24:10.388 --> 24:11.890
those ancient,
mysterious skills?

24:11.923 --> 24:13.124
YouTube.

24:14.359 --> 24:15.894
Told you it was a stupid idea.

24:15.927 --> 24:18.829
Well, gentlemen,
voodoo dolls and all,

24:18.862 --> 24:20.797
you guys did a good job.

24:20.831 --> 24:23.634
Anybody that has lived in
Fall Creek Valley long enough

24:23.666 --> 24:27.237
has heard the tales of went
on up there over the years.

24:27.271 --> 24:29.138
Like Bloody Bobby?

24:31.240 --> 24:34.310
It's Halloween this
weekend, so no homework.

24:34.343 --> 24:35.711
Have fun and enjoy yourselves.

24:35.745 --> 24:39.115
Be safe and always
check your candy.

24:41.283 --> 24:42.584
Hey, guys, hold up.

24:45.387 --> 24:46.788
Can I have a word with you?

24:51.226 --> 24:53.661
Where did you hear
about Bloody Bobby?

24:53.693 --> 24:55.729
This morning, why?

24:55.763 --> 24:57.998
Was it from some
local crazy guy

24:58.032 --> 25:00.668
who looks like he
hasn't slept in weeks?

25:00.700 --> 25:03.637
I'd say that description
is pretty spot on.

25:07.140 --> 25:09.842
That is local crock pot
and conspiracy theorist

25:09.876 --> 25:12.712
Alex Griffin, he is bad news.

25:12.745 --> 25:14.948
You guys need to
stay clear of him,

25:14.981 --> 25:17.282
especially around Halloween.

25:17.316 --> 25:18.684
Why?

25:18.717 --> 25:20.085
Take a look at this.

25:20.118 --> 25:21.220
People are gonna
take away from this

25:21.253 --> 25:22.454
whatever they want.

25:22.487 --> 25:23.589
It's not gonna stop
it from becoming

25:23.622 --> 25:25.023
some twisted urban legend.

25:25.057 --> 25:28.193
Parents are gonna find their
kids in the dark, chanting,

25:28.227 --> 25:30.261
as if they're trying
to channel his spirit

25:30.294 --> 25:32.230
and bring him back to life.

25:32.263 --> 25:34.465
They're gonna hear
their kids whispering,

25:34.498 --> 25:39.503
Bloody Bobby, Bloody Bobby,
Bloody Bobby, Bloody Bobby.

25:40.737 --> 25:41.706
He has spent the
last 10 years trying

25:41.738 --> 25:43.139
to convince anybody
who will listen

25:43.173 --> 25:44.908
that Fall Creek
Valley's being haunted

25:44.941 --> 25:48.912
by an evil demonic spirit
known as Bloody Bobby.

25:50.947 --> 25:52.815
Sounds like this
guys been smoking it up

25:52.848 --> 25:55.317
with the Barker Brothers
at Diablo's Den.

25:56.952 --> 25:59.723
He might be crazy,
maybe even dangerous.

25:59.755 --> 26:02.691
So play it safe and
stay away from him.

26:07.862 --> 26:10.064
Gentlemen, when did
you post this video?

26:10.098 --> 26:12.000
Earlier this
morning before school.

26:12.033 --> 26:13.401
Why?

26:13.434 --> 26:15.303
You, my friends, are a hit.

26:15.336 --> 26:16.337
Look.

26:21.341 --> 26:23.277
Oh my God, that is awesome.

26:23.310 --> 26:25.879
See, I told you
the voodoo dolls would work.

26:27.681 --> 26:28.581
- Have you seen this movie?
- And she was all

26:28.614 --> 26:29.915
up in Laurie's face, like

26:29.949 --> 26:32.485
you're gonna burn in hell and
bring Flash down with you.

26:32.518 --> 26:33.754
Oh, hell no.

26:33.786 --> 26:34.654
See, she's probably
gonna be at Diablo's Den

26:34.687 --> 26:35.955
partying with the rest of you.

26:35.988 --> 26:37.758
That born again bitch needs
to chill the fuck out.

26:37.790 --> 26:38.858
Or just get laid.

26:39.859 --> 26:40.859
I feel sorry for the poor guy

26:40.892 --> 26:41.960
that pops that cherry.

26:41.993 --> 26:42.861
I know.

26:42.894 --> 26:44.529
You guys, she isn't a virgin.

26:44.562 --> 26:45.765
What?

26:45.797 --> 26:47.632
Wait really, who?

26:47.666 --> 26:48.466
Flash?

26:49.834 --> 26:51.771
Flash already told me
the whole story though.

26:51.803 --> 26:53.804
You know, before she
came all self righteous

26:53.837 --> 26:57.041
and religious, they dated for
like three months in freshman.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.642
See, that sex was
probably so good,

26:58.676 --> 27:00.144
it was like a come
to Jesus moment.

27:00.177 --> 27:01.278
I'm telling you.

27:01.312 --> 27:02.680
Are you still talking to him?

27:02.714 --> 27:03.947
Uh, yeah.

27:03.981 --> 27:04.947
Wait, I mean I guess
that makes sense.

27:04.981 --> 27:06.549
That's why she
hates you so much.

27:06.582 --> 27:07.884
Amen or why I hate her.

27:07.917 --> 27:10.486
I bet Flash is amazing
between the sheets, too.

27:11.654 --> 27:13.389
Don't look at me,
I wouldn't know.

27:13.423 --> 27:15.525
Wait, you're telling me you
guys haven't done the nasty.

27:15.558 --> 27:16.491
No.

27:16.525 --> 27:17.993
What are you waiting for?

27:18.026 --> 27:18.894
You better break
that boy off a piece

27:18.927 --> 27:20.730
before someone else does.

27:20.763 --> 27:21.798
- Like me.
- Hey.

27:21.830 --> 27:23.298
- Or me.
- What?

27:23.332 --> 27:24.533
I'm just saying.

27:24.566 --> 27:25.802
You got a good
guy on your hands.

27:25.834 --> 27:26.902
You don't want to
make him wait too long

27:26.935 --> 27:27.969
and you never know,

27:28.003 --> 27:29.837
he might just end up
back with Karolyi.

27:29.870 --> 27:30.671
Sorry.

27:31.939 --> 27:34.075
I was actually thinking
of making tomorrow night

27:34.108 --> 27:35.376
the big night

27:35.409 --> 27:38.846
but that plans gone
down into flames.

27:38.879 --> 27:39.647
So.

27:39.680 --> 27:40.815
Why?

27:40.847 --> 27:44.384
Because, look I
can't go to the dance.

27:44.417 --> 27:45.820
What, why?

27:45.852 --> 27:46.920
My mom has to work.

27:46.953 --> 27:48.521
So?

27:48.555 --> 27:50.223
Well, somebody's got to
take Regan trick or treating.

27:50.256 --> 27:53.892
Why don't you just have Eliot
watch her for a few hours?

27:53.926 --> 27:55.661
That's actually
not a bad idea.

27:55.695 --> 27:57.196
He does owe me
after this morning.

27:57.229 --> 27:59.098
Not bad, more like brilliant.

27:59.131 --> 28:01.166
Okay, so little sis gets
to get off for Halloween

28:01.200 --> 28:03.102
and big sis gets
to get freaky deaky

28:03.135 --> 28:04.369
- Halloween costume sex.
- Yes, she does.

28:04.402 --> 28:05.937
Looks like it's gonna
be a good Halloween

28:05.970 --> 28:07.205
for the Peterson kids.

28:08.539 --> 28:10.208
I don't think Elliot
would agree with that.

28:10.241 --> 28:11.876
Oh, he'll get over it

28:11.909 --> 28:13.211
and like you said he owes
you one from this morning

28:13.244 --> 28:15.546
from saving his ass from
the Barker Brothers.

28:16.748 --> 28:19.082
I wish I didn't know
about you and Judd.

28:19.116 --> 28:20.684
Well, I'm not
embarrassed of him.

28:20.718 --> 28:23.019
Then why did you keep
your little fling a secret?

28:23.053 --> 28:25.555
Because you're always so
critical about everything,

28:25.589 --> 28:27.257
especially when
it comes to boys.

28:27.290 --> 28:28.557
I'm not critical.

28:28.591 --> 28:31.460
I just have time for
stupid high school guys.

28:31.494 --> 28:33.562
What about Dave
from chemistry?

28:33.596 --> 28:35.231
That was different,
Dave was...

28:35.264 --> 28:36.966
I thought this was
between me and you.

28:36.999 --> 28:38.634
So its okay for the
captain to keep secrets

28:38.667 --> 28:39.803
but not her crew?

28:39.836 --> 28:41.069
It was a one time thing.

28:41.102 --> 28:42.137
Why are we making
this such a big deal?

28:42.170 --> 28:43.806
Because you're the
one keeping secrets.

28:43.839 --> 28:45.306
Laurie and I are besties.

28:45.340 --> 28:47.777
Hey wait, I thought
I was your bestie.

28:51.246 --> 28:51.980
Got you.

28:52.013 --> 28:53.213
Snap that.

28:53.247 --> 28:54.448
Please.

28:54.481 --> 28:55.048
See, told
you I was scary.

28:55.082 --> 28:56.116
Yeah, you are.

28:56.150 --> 28:57.050
So what time are we meeting

28:57.084 --> 28:58.385
at the front of the school?

28:58.419 --> 28:59.821
I think I can get
out of this nuthouse

28:59.854 --> 29:00.954
and be there around nine.

29:00.988 --> 29:01.989
Nine works for me.

29:02.022 --> 29:03.624
Oh, fashionably late.

29:03.657 --> 29:05.458
We can make an appearance
that no one can forget.

29:05.491 --> 29:06.993
I love it.

29:07.026 --> 29:08.261
Hey, Elliot, how did it go?

29:08.294 --> 29:09.362
I'm viral.

29:10.630 --> 29:11.431
Mom, Mom!

29:12.298 --> 29:13.801
What happened?

29:13.834 --> 29:15.168
He uploaded a video

29:15.201 --> 29:18.937
and it's gotten like 66,000
views since this morning.

29:18.970 --> 29:20.572
H, that's impressive.

29:20.605 --> 29:22.307
Yeah, kind of a big deal.

29:22.340 --> 29:24.376
You've always been
a big deal, Pork Chop.

29:25.644 --> 29:26.913
So we'll be seeing you.

29:26.945 --> 29:28.680
Please be on time,
do not be late.

29:28.713 --> 29:30.247
Aye aye, Captain.

29:30.281 --> 29:31.649
Oh very funny.

29:31.683 --> 29:32.684
Mom!

29:32.717 --> 29:34.285
Mom, I'm viral.

29:34.318 --> 29:35.286
Oh my god?

29:35.319 --> 29:36.487
Is it contagious?

29:36.520 --> 29:38.757
Mom, not that kind of viral.

29:41.157 --> 29:43.159
Oh man, I love this family.

30:19.059 --> 30:20.527
Hey Judd, Judd.

30:21.528 --> 30:23.096
Ow, this prostate, bro.

30:25.065 --> 30:26.066
So better.

30:36.710 --> 30:37.443
Money.

30:40.045 --> 30:41.646
Delivery.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.515
This shit better be worth
the top dollar you're charging.

30:43.548 --> 30:46.417
Anything we sell is
Barker Brother approved.

30:47.686 --> 30:48.419
Sounds good.

30:49.855 --> 30:51.656
Hey, why you guys
taking off so early?

30:51.690 --> 30:53.390
The girls, freaked out

30:53.423 --> 30:55.025
about being up here so late.

30:55.058 --> 30:55.793
The girls?

30:56.761 --> 30:57.996
I got it.

30:58.028 --> 30:59.998
Would you like a ride?

31:00.030 --> 31:00.732
Yes, please.

31:06.536 --> 31:08.237
Only the finest
for you, my lady.

31:11.641 --> 31:13.109
Thanks, amigo.

31:16.244 --> 31:17.479
Score.

31:44.337 --> 31:45.104
What?

32:15.132 --> 32:18.101
Suck on that,
you dingle berry.

32:19.469 --> 32:20.972
Hey look at this.

32:21.005 --> 32:23.173
I'm here to kick ass
and chew bubblegum.

32:23.206 --> 32:25.241
So you're basically saying
a child who went missing

32:25.275 --> 32:27.344
30 years ago framed
your brother?

32:27.377 --> 32:30.646
Well it was our fault for
bullying him constantly.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.949
Little Robert Maxwell
with his bloody noses.

32:32.983 --> 32:34.516
Come see this.

32:34.550 --> 32:35.919
Not right now.

32:35.952 --> 32:38.187
This guy's kicking my ass.

32:38.220 --> 32:40.154
Lucky bastards homeschooled

32:40.188 --> 32:43.358
so all he has to do is
play video games all day.

32:43.391 --> 32:44.960
I found this clip
of Bloody Bobby,

32:44.994 --> 32:46.095
it's pretty creepy.

32:46.127 --> 32:47.796
Oh son of a bitch.

32:47.830 --> 32:48.697
Don't worry about that.

32:48.731 --> 32:50.231
Come see this.

32:55.202 --> 32:57.270
And what is thought
to be a double homicide,

32:57.304 --> 33:00.108
former sheriff Ryan Leavitt
and his daughter Sarah Leavitt

33:00.140 --> 33:01.441
were found dead
early this morning

33:01.475 --> 33:02.977
in their Fall Creek Valley home.

33:03.011 --> 33:05.311
Wait, is that your house?

33:05.344 --> 33:06.612
The murderer of the infamous

33:06.646 --> 33:09.181
2008 Fall Creek Valley Massacre.

33:09.215 --> 33:11.718
Leavitt resigned after
25 years of service

33:11.752 --> 33:13.185
with the FCVPD.

33:13.219 --> 33:15.055
Looks like this
from nine years ago.

33:15.088 --> 33:19.025
Neighbors reported hearing a
loud gunshot around midnight.

33:19.058 --> 33:21.393
When deputies arrived,
they found Sarah Leavitt

33:21.426 --> 33:23.194
with a gunshot
wound to the head.

33:23.228 --> 33:24.629
What the fuck?

33:24.664 --> 33:26.398
And Ryan Leavitt's body
was found inside the house

33:26.431 --> 33:27.833
with multiple stab wounds.

33:28.667 --> 33:30.467
There has been nothing said

33:30.501 --> 33:32.202
about these murders being linked

33:32.236 --> 33:34.839
to the murders a year
ago on Halloween.

33:58.961 --> 33:59.729
Phoebe?

34:04.365 --> 34:05.399
Pheebs?

34:09.203 --> 34:10.271
What is that?

34:11.539 --> 34:12.808
What is what?

34:14.810 --> 34:16.944
I saw that Lawrence
ass little fuck

34:16.977 --> 34:18.578
playing with these
the other day.

34:18.611 --> 34:19.479
What for?

34:20.647 --> 34:21.548
Hell if I know.

34:23.550 --> 34:25.853
What an ugly fucking doll, man.

34:25.886 --> 34:27.888
You know, it kind
of looks like you.

34:28.722 --> 34:29.689
Bullshit.

34:29.723 --> 34:30.456
No for real, check it out.

34:30.489 --> 34:31.290
It does.

34:32.257 --> 34:33.625
It does kind of.

34:35.762 --> 34:37.030
What the hell?

34:37.063 --> 34:37.797
Put it out of
it's misery, bro.

34:37.831 --> 34:39.199
What do we have here?

34:39.231 --> 34:40.264
What?

34:41.232 --> 34:43.135
Looks like you
got one, too, asshole.

34:43.168 --> 34:43.969
What?

34:45.671 --> 34:47.139
Give me that.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.073
Let me see it.

34:48.107 --> 34:48.941
- No.
- Come on.

34:48.974 --> 34:50.142
Catch it.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.375
- Hey, guys.
- Come and get it.

34:51.409 --> 34:52.977
Don't you dare,
don't you dare.

34:53.010 --> 34:53.911
You think this is a game huh?

34:53.945 --> 34:54.979
Give it back, give it back.

34:55.012 --> 34:56.613
You want some huh?

34:58.182 --> 35:00.118
Oh my god, real mature guys.

35:03.987 --> 35:05.188
Girls, wait up.

35:15.498 --> 35:17.833
So, your mom never told you

35:17.867 --> 35:19.802
that someone was murdered here?

35:19.835 --> 35:20.635
No.

35:21.971 --> 35:23.739
That's messed up.

35:23.773 --> 35:25.141
I don't think she even knows.

35:25.174 --> 35:27.475
Did you at least get a
good deal on this house?

35:30.277 --> 35:31.445
What are you guys doing?

35:31.478 --> 35:33.148
Whoa, damn, fellas.

35:33.181 --> 35:34.581
Why are you so paranoid?

35:34.615 --> 35:36.416
Did you know that Bloody Bobby

35:36.450 --> 35:38.452
killed two people in your house?

35:38.485 --> 35:40.419
Bloody who?

35:40.453 --> 35:42.689
A demonic little monster
who wants to kill everyone

35:42.723 --> 35:44.624
in Fall Creek
Valley on Halloween

35:44.658 --> 35:46.459
and according to the internet

35:46.492 --> 35:49.328
you guys live in the house
of the past two victims.

35:49.362 --> 35:50.596
Right.

35:50.630 --> 35:52.832
Well I wouldn't trust everything
you hear on the internet

35:52.865 --> 35:55.701
because most of it is bullshit.

35:58.137 --> 36:00.673
Well, I'm gonna go to bed.

36:00.706 --> 36:02.775
Be sure you're in bed
before Mom gets home, okay?

36:02.809 --> 36:04.375
Okay, fine.

36:04.408 --> 36:05.643
I'm holding you to it.

36:05.677 --> 36:07.411
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

36:08.914 --> 36:11.549
No one believes anything
on the internet these days.

36:17.021 --> 36:19.389
Yo, why would that
fat little bastard

36:19.422 --> 36:22.358
even have voodoo dolls
in the first place?

36:22.392 --> 36:23.694
I think it has something to do

36:23.727 --> 36:26.030
with the project he was
working with Elliot on.

36:30.834 --> 36:31.600
What project?

36:32.702 --> 36:34.369
Something about Diablo's Den.

36:34.403 --> 36:36.005
Yeah, I don't know.

36:36.039 --> 36:37.639
They posted it today and it
already has 66,000 views.

36:37.674 --> 36:38.708
Bullshit.

36:38.741 --> 36:40.075
No, I'm serious.

36:40.108 --> 36:41.375
No, no, no.

36:41.409 --> 36:42.744
There's no way in hell
that that little shit...

36:42.778 --> 36:44.313
Okay, I was wrong.

36:44.345 --> 36:46.748
It actually 100,000 views now.

36:46.782 --> 36:48.349
What, let me see that.

36:51.119 --> 36:52.419
What?

36:52.452 --> 36:55.089
Locals refer to this
area as Diablo's Den.

36:55.122 --> 36:59.026
The most haunted landmark
in Fall Creek Valley.

38:38.851 --> 38:40.285
Here, high five, though.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.522
Oh fuck me.

38:45.623 --> 38:47.625
Mission accomplished.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.294
Asshole.

38:49.328 --> 38:51.363
My curfew's midnight,
I'm gonna be late.

38:51.396 --> 38:52.495
Who's rule is that?

38:52.529 --> 38:54.265
My dad.

38:54.298 --> 38:55.166
You'll be fine.

38:55.199 --> 38:56.566
You do not know my dad.

38:57.735 --> 38:59.637
I'm glad I don't
know your dad.

38:59.670 --> 39:00.671
Yeah.

39:02.073 --> 39:03.407
He would kick your ass.

39:06.508 --> 39:08.778
Ow, fuck.

39:08.812 --> 39:10.479
Ow.

39:10.512 --> 39:11.314
Goddamn.

39:12.682 --> 39:13.917
I got to go find Phoebe.

39:18.854 --> 39:20.621
Yo, close the door.

39:20.656 --> 39:21.556
Fuck you.

39:36.337 --> 39:37.372
Marshmallow?

39:39.940 --> 39:41.708
Gross, it's burnt.

39:43.509 --> 39:44.711
Only on one side.

39:46.579 --> 39:47.381
Huh?

40:46.768 --> 40:48.970
Are you kidding me right now?

40:49.004 --> 40:50.739
Look, I don't know what you
think is gonna happen here

40:50.772 --> 40:52.873
but whatever you
think it is, it's not.

40:52.907 --> 40:53.641
Go.

40:53.674 --> 40:55.242
Phoebe.

40:55.276 --> 40:56.343
Phoebe, wait.

41:01.614 --> 41:03.084
Pheebs?

41:25.637 --> 41:27.339
Oh hell no, I'm
not doing this alone.

41:27.372 --> 41:28.139
Ace!

41:30.541 --> 41:31.342
Ace.

41:35.612 --> 41:36.647
Ace?

41:41.518 --> 41:43.019
Stop being an asshole.

41:43.053 --> 41:43.820
Please just come out.

41:43.854 --> 41:44.621
Phoebe.

41:46.156 --> 41:49.292
Phoebe, we have to go.

41:49.326 --> 41:50.861
We're gonna be late.

41:57.399 --> 41:59.869
I don't know where they are.

42:05.173 --> 42:06.674
Are you gonna help?

42:10.078 --> 42:11.212
Judd come on.

42:13.648 --> 42:16.350
Judd stop, I'm being serious.

42:16.383 --> 42:18.185
Judd, Judd stop, stop!

42:21.688 --> 42:22.723
Judd!

42:26.059 --> 42:26.927
Judd, stop!

43:05.895 --> 43:06.696
Ace?

43:22.744 --> 43:23.545
Oh my God.

44:05.917 --> 44:06.751
No.

44:08.820 --> 44:10.121
Say cheese.

44:10.154 --> 44:11.122
Please.

44:17.794 --> 44:19.930
You want a marshmallow?

44:38.948 --> 44:39.981
Really?

44:40.982 --> 44:41.983
What?

44:42.017 --> 44:44.085
We have company.

44:44.119 --> 44:44.886
Oh Pork Chop?

44:46.488 --> 44:47.789
He isn't company, he's family.

44:47.822 --> 44:49.424
I don't mind, Ms. Peterson.

44:49.457 --> 44:52.694
Oh, also, Elliot and
I found something out

44:52.727 --> 44:54.528
about this house last...

44:54.561 --> 44:55.863
What about the house?

44:55.896 --> 44:57.865
Just that it went up in value.

45:00.534 --> 45:03.203
Anyway, you guys are not
to eat any of the candy

45:03.237 --> 45:04.203
from trick or treating tonight

45:04.237 --> 45:05.639
till I get home and check it.

45:05.673 --> 45:07.206
Seriously?

45:07.240 --> 45:09.208
Who in the hell would
put drugs into candy?

45:09.242 --> 45:11.944
Not just drugs, glass,
poison, razor blades.

45:11.978 --> 45:13.813
Razor blades?

45:13.846 --> 45:16.716
Don't worry, honey,
that's mommy's gonna take it

45:16.749 --> 45:17.883
and get it x-rayed.

45:17.916 --> 45:21.053
I think you're
overreacting just a little.

45:21.086 --> 45:22.454
No, Laurie, I'm not.

45:22.487 --> 45:24.856
There's a lot of sick
perverts out there.

45:24.890 --> 45:26.124
Pervert candy?

45:26.158 --> 45:27.858
I don't want pervert candy.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.996
Don't worry, honey,
we're gonna check it

45:32.029 --> 45:33.564
and it's gonna be fine.

45:33.597 --> 45:35.132
Look, I just really need you

45:35.166 --> 45:38.035
to look after your brother
and sister tonight, please.

45:40.036 --> 45:41.037
Okay.

45:41.071 --> 45:42.072
Thank you.

46:06.795 --> 46:10.064
System deactivated.

46:59.143 --> 47:01.078
It's happening.

47:06.949 --> 47:08.518
Hey, sexy, what you doing?

47:10.119 --> 47:12.155
Just grabbing a couple
things for tonight.

47:12.188 --> 47:14.223
You expecting a big turn out?

47:14.257 --> 47:17.325
Well, you never want
to run out of candy.

47:17.359 --> 47:19.094
Yeah, those 10 year olds
can be pretty vicious.

47:19.127 --> 47:20.295
Uh huh.

47:20.328 --> 47:21.096
You want a ride?

47:21.129 --> 47:21.930
Yeah.

47:24.166 --> 47:25.635
Thanks.

47:25.668 --> 47:27.168
You look cute this morning.

47:27.201 --> 47:28.436
Oh, so do you.

47:29.704 --> 47:31.972
So, did you make it
out to Diablo's Den

47:32.006 --> 47:34.008
last night after the game?

47:34.041 --> 47:35.911
No, I wasn't gonna
go if you weren't.

47:38.379 --> 47:41.181
Hey, what time are you
leaving for the dance tonight?

47:41.214 --> 47:42.616
Oh I told
the girls around nine.

47:42.650 --> 47:44.117
Nine?

47:44.150 --> 47:45.485
Isn't that a little late?

47:46.986 --> 47:49.355
Well, I just thought it
would give us some alone time

47:49.389 --> 47:50.490
before the dance tonight.

47:50.523 --> 47:52.057
Yeah but nine is...

47:57.196 --> 48:00.767
Yeah nine is pretty much when
all the excitement starts.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.167
Be at the house around seven.

48:02.201 --> 48:04.969
That's when Regan and Elliot
should be trick or treating.

48:05.737 --> 48:06.872
Got it.

48:06.905 --> 48:10.107
I shall be there at six 60, 59.

48:10.141 --> 48:10.909
6:59.

48:29.058 --> 48:31.527
He does not like me, does it?

48:31.560 --> 48:33.663
Don't take it too personally.

48:33.697 --> 48:34.965
He's just bent out of shape

48:34.997 --> 48:38.033
because he's stuck taking Regan
trick or treating tonight.

48:39.835 --> 48:42.036
I mean that's not cool,
he's dancing with it.

48:45.173 --> 48:47.075
Hello?

48:47.108 --> 48:50.211
And that must be your mom.

48:50.245 --> 48:51.813
Yeah.

48:51.846 --> 48:55.015
Listen, I swear, tonight
they'll be no distractions.

48:55.048 --> 48:56.049
None.

48:56.083 --> 48:56.851
None at all.

48:56.885 --> 48:58.385
- Okay.
- Okay.

48:58.418 --> 49:00.020
I'll see you tonight.

49:00.053 --> 49:01.054
See you.

49:04.457 --> 49:05.258
Quit it.

49:08.427 --> 49:10.096
Wow, he's cute.

49:12.599 --> 49:14.534
Make sure you put
the lawn mower away.

49:14.567 --> 49:16.101
I will, I will.

49:18.069 --> 49:19.237
Brought you some lemonade.

49:20.071 --> 49:21.406
You're welcome.

49:43.560 --> 49:45.029
Your dad
and I will be home.

49:45.061 --> 49:47.263
We don't want anyone over now.

49:48.431 --> 49:50.099
Okay, have fun at
your old people party.

49:50.133 --> 49:52.100
I'm gonna go out with the
girls tonight, don't worry.

49:52.134 --> 49:53.068
You're going out?

49:53.101 --> 49:54.637
Yeah, to the school dance.

49:54.671 --> 49:56.773
Honey, we talked about that.

49:56.806 --> 49:57.640
We did?

49:57.674 --> 49:58.574
Yes, we did.

49:58.608 --> 49:59.541
Now come on, let's go, let's go.

49:59.575 --> 50:01.276
See you guys, have fun.

50:01.310 --> 50:02.712
Have fun, honey.

50:02.745 --> 50:04.445
- Don't have too much fun.
- Yeah, yeah.

Laurie, watch your language.

56:51.118 --> 56:52.519
Just coming.

56:59.160 --> 57:00.761
- Hi.
- Trick or treat.

57:00.795 --> 57:01.862
Oh, wow.

57:01.896 --> 57:05.497
Cool, my first
tricksters of the night.

57:05.531 --> 57:06.967
Here we go.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.903
Some for you and for you.

57:11.638 --> 57:12.639
Happy Halloween.

57:14.907 --> 57:16.342
You know what, on
second thoughts.

57:16.375 --> 57:19.311
You're probably my
last trick or treaters.

57:19.345 --> 57:20.779
You can just have it all.

57:20.813 --> 57:21.547
- Thank you.
- No problem.

57:21.580 --> 57:22.715
Thank you.

57:22.748 --> 57:24.683
Well, have a good one.

57:29.554 --> 57:34.092
That should eliminate all
distractions for the night.

57:47.070 --> 57:47.871
Wow.

57:49.406 --> 57:51.974
I'm sorry, I don't really
have any candy for you.

57:52.008 --> 57:56.612
I just gave it all away but
happy Halloween, little one.

59:06.176 --> 59:07.310
Jesus, Flash.

59:10.413 --> 59:12.248
Scary right?

59:12.282 --> 59:17.286
I am literally
freaking weirded out.

59:21.023 --> 59:22.124
Why are we weirded out?

59:22.157 --> 59:22.958
You okay?

59:25.694 --> 59:28.596
Yeah, just some weird
kid just kind of came

59:28.629 --> 59:30.798
and then probably just
some kids pranking.

59:30.832 --> 59:32.300
You're okay.

59:32.333 --> 59:33.601
Yeah.

59:33.634 --> 59:34.669
You look cute.

59:36.104 --> 59:36.838
So do you.

59:38.472 --> 59:39.639
Thanks.

59:39.673 --> 59:41.241
Do you have anymore treats?

59:41.274 --> 59:43.643
Maybe just might
of saved some.

59:43.677 --> 59:45.245
- Thank you.
- Happy Halloween.

59:45.278 --> 59:46.046
Thanks.

59:55.788 --> 59:56.655
Oh no.

59:56.689 --> 59:58.257
What?

59:58.290 --> 1:00:00.159
You have to have it
checked before you eat it.

1:00:00.192 --> 1:00:01.994
Could be pervert candy.

1:00:02.027 --> 1:00:04.729
I like to live my life
on the wild side of things.

1:00:05.830 --> 1:00:06.831
Your funeral.

1:00:06.865 --> 1:00:07.966
It's getting late.

1:00:07.999 --> 1:00:08.933
One more street.

1:00:08.967 --> 1:00:10.969
We've done all these houses.

1:00:11.002 --> 1:00:11.870
But my bag isn't...

1:00:11.903 --> 1:00:12.871
It is full.

1:00:12.904 --> 1:00:13.671
It was a good night.

1:00:13.705 --> 1:00:15.139
Let's go home.

1:00:15.172 --> 1:00:16.507
Fine.

1:00:19.209 --> 1:00:20.545
Wait.

1:00:20.578 --> 1:00:22.146
What?

1:00:22.179 --> 1:00:24.982
Let's cut through the church.

1:00:25.015 --> 1:00:25.816
Hell no.

1:00:26.816 --> 1:00:28.184

1:01:00.414 --> 1:01:03.716
I'm pretty sure we're gonna
have more fun in your room.

1:01:03.750 --> 1:01:04.751
Come on.

1:01:04.784 --> 1:01:07.420
Everyone's expecting us
and we're already late

1:01:07.453 --> 1:01:10.323
so we really gotta go.

1:01:32.910 --> 1:01:33.778
Slow down.

1:01:33.811 --> 1:01:35.379
Why are you going so fast?

1:01:35.413 --> 1:01:37.215
I think
someone's following us.

1:01:37.248 --> 1:01:38.049
Come on.

1:01:46.056 --> 1:01:48.626
Is he still following us?

1:01:48.659 --> 1:01:49.560
I don't know, I don't see him.

1:01:49.594 --> 1:01:50.793
Hey.

1:01:51.894 --> 1:01:53.697
I believe you're
in terrible danger.

1:01:53.729 --> 1:01:55.397
We don't want any trouble.

1:01:55.431 --> 1:01:56.365
Trouble?

1:01:56.398 --> 1:01:57.132
It's a little too late for that.

1:01:57.166 --> 1:01:58.100
He's already here.

1:01:58.133 --> 1:01:58.934
What are you talking about?

1:02:00.502 --> 1:02:03.639
Bloody Bobby's here and
you're the one responsible

1:02:03.672 --> 1:02:04.872
for calling for him.

1:02:04.906 --> 1:02:06.307
Me, what did I do?

1:02:06.341 --> 1:02:11.079
You invited him to
come out and play.

1:02:12.581 --> 1:02:16.250
You, your friends, your family,

1:02:17.619 --> 1:02:19.587
everyone is a target tonight.

1:02:19.621 --> 1:02:21.755
I told you the voodoo
dolls were a bad idea.

1:02:21.788 --> 1:02:24.124
No, I mean, I didn't, I just.

1:02:24.157 --> 1:02:25.826
They told me it was over.

1:02:25.859 --> 1:02:30.062
They said I was crazy but I
knew, I knew he would return.

1:02:30.096 --> 1:02:31.897
What the hell are
you talking about it?

1:02:31.931 --> 1:02:32.798
He isn't real.

1:02:32.832 --> 1:02:34.767
He's just a stupid urban legend.

1:02:35.835 --> 1:02:37.604
That little monster
killed my brother

1:02:37.638 --> 1:02:40.839
and if you don't take my
advice, you'll be dead, too.

1:02:40.872 --> 1:02:43.709
You, everyone.

1:02:45.043 --> 1:02:48.480
Go home, lock up, and if
anyone comes knocking,

1:02:48.513 --> 1:02:50.948
don't open the door.

1:02:50.981 --> 1:02:54.218
Until the clock strikes
midnight and Halloween is over.

1:02:58.455 --> 1:03:00.659
Told you he was crazy.

1:03:00.692 --> 1:03:01.760
I'm scared.

1:03:03.293 --> 1:03:05.995
Hey, what are you guys doing?

1:03:06.029 --> 1:03:08.498
Son of a bitch,
is that you Alex?

1:03:08.532 --> 1:03:09.832
Goddamn it.

1:03:09.866 --> 1:03:11.367
You're telling those
ghost stories again?

1:03:11.401 --> 1:03:14.103
I warned you about this.

1:03:14.137 --> 1:03:16.539
You want to spend another
Halloween behind bars?

1:03:16.572 --> 1:03:19.508
No, officer, he wasn't
harassing us or anything.

1:03:19.542 --> 1:03:22.177
He just saw us and
told us to go home.

1:03:23.579 --> 1:03:25.147
Fine.

1:03:25.180 --> 1:03:26.881
You three head home.

1:03:26.914 --> 1:03:27.915
Oh no.

1:03:29.417 --> 1:03:30.217
You stay.

1:03:33.254 --> 1:03:34.055
We need to talk.

1:03:42.095 --> 1:03:43.296
What?

1:03:43.330 --> 1:03:44.864
Nothing.

1:03:44.898 --> 1:03:47.568
You just, you look so
cute in that outfit.

1:03:49.903 --> 1:03:52.404
That outfit of
yours is absolutely...

1:03:52.438 --> 1:03:54.340
- Look out!
- Holy shit!

1:03:55.542 --> 1:03:56.909
What the hell was that?

1:03:56.942 --> 1:03:58.043
It looks like that
kid from earlier.

1:03:58.077 --> 1:03:59.478
The one who was
messing with you?

1:03:59.512 --> 1:04:01.213
Yeah.

1:04:01.246 --> 1:04:02.914
Just wandered out into
the middle of street.

1:04:02.947 --> 1:04:03.716
He's gonna get hurt.

1:04:03.749 --> 1:04:05.049
Or killed.

1:04:06.417 --> 1:04:07.218
Fuck.

1:04:09.053 --> 1:04:10.723
That dude
was scary weird.

1:04:10.756 --> 1:04:12.423
Yeah, he's one of those guys

1:04:12.457 --> 1:04:14.826
that gets off on scaring
little kids on Halloween.

1:04:14.858 --> 1:04:16.728
Well, he scared me.

1:04:16.761 --> 1:04:18.763
He was pretty convincing

1:04:18.796 --> 1:04:20.598
but it's all just pretend.

1:04:20.631 --> 1:04:22.466
It was make believe, okay?

1:04:26.036 --> 1:04:27.870
Can I watch a movie
before I go to bed?

1:04:27.903 --> 1:04:30.005
As long as you
watch it in your room.

1:04:30.039 --> 1:04:31.040
Sweet.

1:04:32.241 --> 1:04:34.210
Keep this Bloody Bobby
thing on the down low.

1:04:34.243 --> 1:04:36.879
I don't need Regan so freaked
out she can't sleep tonight.

1:04:36.912 --> 1:04:39.414
Yeah but do you
think that it was real?

1:04:39.447 --> 1:04:41.717
'Cause he sounded
really nervous about it.

1:04:41.751 --> 1:04:43.017
He was just crazy.

1:04:43.051 --> 1:04:44.553
Remember what Mr.
Carpenter said?

1:04:44.587 --> 1:04:46.388
It's just a stupid urban legend

1:04:46.421 --> 1:04:48.423
to get kids scared on Halloween.

1:04:49.924 --> 1:04:51.959
You're scared, aren't you?

1:04:51.992 --> 1:04:52.993
No.

1:04:54.662 --> 1:04:56.865
Okay, maybe just a little.

1:05:17.949 --> 1:05:21.353
System deactivated.

1:05:29.193 --> 1:05:29.994
Hello?

1:07:29.036 --> 1:07:30.037
Who's that?

1:07:30.070 --> 1:07:31.171
Just Eli checking in.

1:07:31.205 --> 1:07:32.874
Looks like they just got home.

1:07:32.908 --> 1:07:34.174
That's good.

1:07:34.208 --> 1:07:35.010
You heard anything
from the girls?

1:07:35.042 --> 1:07:36.176
No.

1:07:36.210 --> 1:07:38.879
I don't see any of
their cars here, either.

1:07:38.913 --> 1:07:41.749
Yeah no sign of the
Stabbing Cabin either.

1:07:41.782 --> 1:07:42.883
Thank god for that.

1:07:44.117 --> 1:07:46.520
Well, looks like we're
the first to get here.

1:07:46.554 --> 1:07:48.656
Let me just text Britney.

1:07:50.122 --> 1:07:52.525
I mean like, it's 10 o'clock.

1:07:52.559 --> 1:07:53.560
How fashionably late do you have

1:07:53.593 --> 1:07:55.528
to be to make an entrance?

1:07:55.562 --> 1:07:57.262
You know what Britney's like.

1:07:57.296 --> 1:07:59.064
Yeah, I know
their costumes suck.

1:08:01.400 --> 1:08:04.435
Burbank tower to
American flight 812, over.

1:08:05.938 --> 1:08:09.240
Burbank tower to American
flight 812, over.

1:08:09.273 --> 1:08:10.709
Holy mackerel.

1:08:10.742 --> 1:08:12.978
Burbank tower
to American flight 812.

1:08:42.805 --> 1:08:46.274
Ugh, I can actually
see you getting fatter.

1:08:46.307 --> 1:08:49.344
Didn't your mom put you
on a diet or something?

1:08:50.645 --> 1:08:51.779
It's a cheat day.

1:08:55.683 --> 1:08:56.951
Relax, dork.

1:08:56.985 --> 1:08:59.186
This is mine, yours is
over there by the door.

1:09:00.153 --> 1:09:01.823
My mom always checks
it before we're allowed

1:09:01.855 --> 1:09:02.656
to eat any of it.

1:09:03.890 --> 1:09:04.992
Yeah, I heard her
talking about that.

1:09:05.025 --> 1:09:07.293
Kind of overprotective,
if you ask me.

1:09:07.326 --> 1:09:10.797
Yeah, well she's seen a
lot of shit being a nurse.

1:09:12.131 --> 1:09:15.166
Don't worry, this is has my
Pork Chop seal of approval.

1:09:19.237 --> 1:09:20.806
What was that?

1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:23.141
I think Regan woke up?

1:09:25.745 --> 1:09:29.213
Regan?

1:09:29.246 --> 1:09:30.515
Regan, what's wrong?

1:09:33.018 --> 1:09:33.818
What?

1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:38.321
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1:09:42.392 --> 1:09:44.227
Can you leave the light on?

1:09:44.260 --> 1:09:45.062
Okay.

1:09:46.497 --> 1:09:47.263
Goodnight.

1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:07.516
I don't see them in there.

1:10:07.549 --> 1:10:08.650
I've been calling Judd and Ace

1:10:08.684 --> 1:10:10.052
and no ones answering
their phone.

1:10:10.085 --> 1:10:11.218
Think they ditched us?

1:10:11.252 --> 1:10:12.353
I don't know.

1:10:12.386 --> 1:10:13.254
They didn't ditch you.

1:10:13.287 --> 1:10:14.755
How would you even know that?

1:10:14.789 --> 1:10:16.389
Their bodies have
been found slaughtered

1:10:16.423 --> 1:10:18.191
up by Diablo's Den
earlier this morning.

1:10:18.224 --> 1:10:19.026
What?

1:10:20.528 --> 1:10:22.530
It's been
allover the news.

1:10:22.563 --> 1:10:25.533
I'm surprised that you
haven't heard anything.

1:10:25.566 --> 1:10:27.067
How did it happen?

1:10:27.100 --> 1:10:29.201
It's still
undergoing investigation

1:10:29.234 --> 1:10:32.237
so they're releasing
very little details.

1:10:32.271 --> 1:10:34.040
Look, who was up
there when you there?

1:10:34.074 --> 1:10:35.075
Ashley and Phoebe.

1:10:43.716 --> 1:10:45.184
Shit.

1:10:45.216 --> 1:10:47.920
Why won't anyone
answer their phone?

1:10:51.489 --> 1:10:52.255
Let's go home.

1:10:52.289 --> 1:10:55.059
let's get out of here.

1:10:55.093 --> 1:10:56.293
You hungry?

1:10:56.326 --> 1:10:57.360
I could eat.

1:10:57.394 --> 1:10:58.629
Of course you can.

1:10:58.663 --> 1:11:00.430
I was thinking about
throwing in a frozen pizza.

1:11:01.431 --> 1:11:03.232
You got any ranch?

1:11:03.265 --> 1:11:04.868
What?

1:11:04.901 --> 1:11:06.737
I like to have
ranch with my pizza.

1:11:09.438 --> 1:11:11.975
Yeah about three
quarters of a bottle.

1:11:15.177 --> 1:11:16.277
Big or little?

1:11:16.311 --> 1:11:17.245
I don't know.

1:11:17.278 --> 1:11:18.547
Normal.

1:11:18.581 --> 1:11:20.683
Okay yeah,
that should be enough.

1:11:55.481 --> 1:11:58.618
Says it will be done
in about 15 minutes.

1:12:19.203 --> 1:12:21.337
You know it.

1:12:22.206 --> 1:12:24.307
Hey, that's my sister.

1:12:24.340 --> 1:12:26.676
I know but your sister is hot.

1:12:26.709 --> 1:12:29.979
She has a sweet apple bottom.

1:12:30.013 --> 1:12:32.482
Does everything have
to be food with you?

1:12:34.017 --> 1:12:35.285
Hey.

1:12:35.317 --> 1:12:37.352
Power went out.

1:12:50.565 --> 1:12:53.034
Trick or
treat, smell my feet,

1:12:53.067 --> 1:12:55.402
give me something good to eat.

1:12:57.939 --> 1:12:58.706
It's.

1:12:58.739 --> 1:12:59.507
What?

1:12:59.540 --> 1:13:00.373
It, it's.

1:13:11.051 --> 1:13:12.752
It's coming
from inside the house.

1:13:12.786 --> 1:13:14.153
Wait here.

1:13:23.896 --> 1:13:24.697
Wait in the car!

1:13:49.418 --> 1:13:50.720
Hands off that, boy.

1:14:11.573 --> 1:14:12.406
It's okay, it's
okay, it's me, relax.

1:14:12.439 --> 1:14:13.807
What the hell happened?

1:14:13.841 --> 1:14:14.808
Bloody Bobby.

1:14:16.243 --> 1:14:17.478
What is that a
SoundCloud rapper?

1:14:17.511 --> 1:14:18.545
I don't know what that is.

1:14:18.579 --> 1:14:19.445
We got to get you
a hospital, man,

1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:20.481
you're bleeding everywhere.

1:14:20.514 --> 1:14:21.482
Come on, come on.

1:14:21.515 --> 1:14:22.783
- Oh, God.
- Christ.

1:14:28.688 --> 1:14:29.722
Regan.

1:14:29.756 --> 1:14:30.924
Go!

1:14:30.957 --> 1:14:33.760
Oh my god, you
guys, get in the car.

1:14:36.629 --> 1:14:37.429
Regan.

1:14:38.363 --> 1:14:39.164
Regan.

1:14:41.466 --> 1:14:43.001
Regan!

1:14:43.035 --> 1:14:44.770
Regan, open the door!

1:14:46.371 --> 1:14:47.406
Is she in there?

1:14:47.438 --> 1:14:49.241
I thought I told you
to stay in the car.

1:14:49.274 --> 1:14:50.508
Regan!

1:14:56.480 --> 1:14:57.848
Regan.

1:14:57.882 --> 1:14:58.983
Are you okay?

1:15:00.351 --> 1:15:01.485
That's not me.

1:15:09.526 --> 1:15:10.527
You're it.

1:15:13.963 --> 1:15:15.264
You okay?

1:15:15.297 --> 1:15:16.131
Are you all right?

1:15:16.899 --> 1:15:17.700
Um.

1:15:18.901 --> 1:15:20.436
I'm gonna teach this
little bitch a lesson.

1:15:20.469 --> 1:15:21.470
I'll be right back.

1:15:21.503 --> 1:15:22.871
Flash, wait, no!

1:15:22.905 --> 1:15:24.340
Oh my God, no.

1:15:27.141 --> 1:15:28.643
Where you at, you little shit?

1:15:32.413 --> 1:15:33.414
You're fucking dead.

1:17:06.766 --> 1:17:07.634
Look out!

1:17:19.678 --> 1:17:22.414
Time to mow the lawn.

1:17:30.088 --> 1:17:31.289
No!

1:17:32.657 --> 1:17:33.691
No.

1:17:36.661 --> 1:17:38.128
Oh my God!

1:17:48.438 --> 1:17:52.208
You really should of
put the lawnmower away.

1:17:55.311 --> 1:17:56.112
Regan.

1:17:57.113 --> 1:17:58.714
Get in the closet.

1:17:59.782 --> 1:18:00.683
Listen to me.

1:18:00.716 --> 1:18:03.051
No matter what, don't move.

1:18:16.230 --> 1:18:20.033
Come out, come
out wherever you are.

1:18:23.137 --> 1:18:23.904
I see you.

1:18:36.583 --> 1:18:37.382
No!

1:18:39.985 --> 1:18:42.320
Well, Regan's out.

1:18:47.159 --> 1:18:47.893
Why so sad?

1:18:47.926 --> 1:18:49.227
It's Halloween.

1:18:52.663 --> 1:18:54.064
Oh my God.

1:19:00.838 --> 1:19:01.738
Go, Regan, go!

1:19:03.773 --> 1:19:04.575
No!

1:19:05.742 --> 1:19:06.544
No!

1:19:10.346 --> 1:19:11.649
When's the last time

1:19:11.681 --> 1:19:12.916
you cleaned this
windshield, Gomez?

1:19:14.450 --> 1:19:16.653
146, we
got a report of a 1016

1:19:16.685 --> 1:19:18.720
at 6363 Detra Lane.

1:19:18.754 --> 1:19:20.422
Proceed with caution, over.

1:19:20.456 --> 1:19:22.858
Isn't that
Leavitt's old house?

1:19:22.891 --> 1:19:23.892
Let's go.

1:19:27.128 --> 1:19:28.863
What's going on?

1:19:28.896 --> 1:19:29.665
I don't know.

1:19:29.697 --> 1:19:30.465
I can't see shit.

1:19:37.237 --> 1:19:38.772
Stop, is that Alex?

1:19:38.805 --> 1:19:41.542
Time to end this nightmare.

1:20:40.328 --> 1:20:41.396
Hey.
