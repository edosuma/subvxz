00:38.548 --> 00:39.807
General's aboard.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.809
Good morning, Sir. How are you?

00:41.910 --> 00:43.712
- Welcome aboard.
- How are you? Thanks very much.

00:44.686 --> 00:46.922
Good morning, everybody,
stand easy, please.

00:47.022 --> 00:48.556
How is everybody today?

00:49.040 --> 00:50.040
Good.

00:51.877 --> 00:54.279
Can I have the key?
Thank you very much.

00:54.379 --> 00:56.114
Fire headquarters, missions?

00:56.214 --> 00:59.076
Be informed today, we have one
flying from Hickam to Kadena.

00:59.176 --> 01:01.995
8 F-4s, 4 K.C.-135s

01:02.095 --> 01:04.873
were executed by the sac
underground at 4:15.

01:04.973 --> 01:07.209
04:15 this morning.

01:07.309 --> 01:10.128
The president
is located at camp David.

01:10.228 --> 01:13.882
The commander-in-chief of Europe
is out of position until the 21st.

01:13.982 --> 01:16.218
And the vice C-in-C
is at Andrews for the day.

01:16.318 --> 01:19.054
He'll be back later this evening
at approximately 19:00.

01:19.154 --> 01:21.723
Ok, this is the current
world intelligence situation.

01:21.823 --> 01:24.226
And you might pay
particular note

01:24.326 --> 01:27.578
to the, uh, nuclear submarines
off the east and west coast.

01:28.121 --> 01:29.121
Ok.

01:30.749 --> 01:33.819
This is S.K.-1 command post with
communications check. How do you hear me?

01:33.919 --> 01:36.071
Complete the review
of those after we take off.

01:36.171 --> 01:37.447
Yes, sir.

01:37.547 --> 01:39.590
You are cleared for takeoff.

01:41.718 --> 01:43.537
Care for some coffee, general?

01:43.637 --> 01:44.637
Yeah, sure.

04:54.035 --> 04:56.187
The west has been unanimous

04:56.287 --> 04:58.148
in condemning the Soviet action

04:58.248 --> 04:59.649
and applying economic sanctions,

04:59.749 --> 05:02.277
which has not stopped the growing
Soviet military presence

05:02.377 --> 05:03.961
along the west German frontier.

05:04.629 --> 05:06.296
NATO intelligence sources report

05:06.506 --> 05:09.200
a massive buildup of infantry
and armored divisions

05:09.300 --> 05:12.954
along the Elbe river, and extending all
the way south to the Czech border,

05:13.054 --> 05:15.749
which the United States fears
could seriously jeopardize

05:15.849 --> 05:18.460
the current round of strategic
arms reduction talks.

05:18.560 --> 05:21.129
The Soviet ambassador declared
the maneuvers to be

05:21.229 --> 05:23.673
the usual Warsaw pact
training exercises.

05:23.773 --> 05:25.300
Ambassador Schiffrin told him

05:25.400 --> 05:27.177
that explanation was unacceptable

05:27.277 --> 05:29.137
and called the action "provocative."

05:29.237 --> 05:31.640
Ambassador Kuragin.

05:31.740 --> 05:33.892
"Provocative"?

05:33.992 --> 05:36.394
You call us "provocative"

05:36.494 --> 05:40.899
when you Americans
have 260,000 soldiers,

05:40.999 --> 05:43.777
and 7,000 nuclear weapons

05:43.877 --> 05:46.837
poised on the other side
of our border?

05:49.340 --> 05:51.409
A lot of kids are born with it.

05:51.509 --> 05:53.578
But we can do something
about it these days.

05:53.678 --> 05:57.290
Now here's the problem.
The septa don't meet properly.

05:57.390 --> 06:00.001
The aorta's rising
from the right ventricle,

06:00.101 --> 06:02.045
and the pulmonary from the left.

06:02.645 --> 06:04.839
We go in here and make
a nice little hole

06:04.939 --> 06:06.841
between the 2 sides of the heart

06:06.941 --> 06:09.173
to allow the blood
to carry enough oxygen

06:09.274 --> 06:10.470
to the rest of the body.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.180
Can you schedule it for Saturday?

06:12.280 --> 06:15.225
No way. I'm pulling 36 hours
straight up at Lawrence,

06:15.325 --> 06:16.830
starting tomorrow.

06:17.410 --> 06:19.896
Hello, Joe.
What did you have for lunch?

06:19.996 --> 06:22.556
Oh, I had turkey with yams,

06:23.333 --> 06:25.402
beans, cranberry sauce...

06:25.502 --> 06:27.378
Nurse said she's getting me
some ice cream,

06:27.478 --> 06:28.738
but she didn't come back.

06:28.838 --> 06:30.365
What flavor do you like best?

06:30.465 --> 06:31.866
Vanilla.

06:31.966 --> 06:33.852
Coffee, if they ain't got vanilla.

06:34.052 --> 06:36.887
You heard the man.
Let's find him his ice cream.

06:55.657 --> 06:58.935
Hey, any of you guys hear
anything about an alert?

06:59.035 --> 07:01.870
Not this weekend, buddy.
I'm going fishing.

07:03.289 --> 07:05.608
When Coop goes fishin',
he generally falls in love.

07:05.708 --> 07:08.737
When you fall in love,
you fall in love.

07:08.837 --> 07:10.697
Every weekend you fall in love.

07:10.797 --> 07:11.898
What's wrong with you, Coop?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.505
Ain't you got no self-control?

07:14.033 --> 07:15.485
Come to think of it,

07:15.586 --> 07:18.388
I could use a nice, quiet weekend.

07:18.488 --> 07:22.042
Weekend, hell, buddy.
I got 30 days paid.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.811
Me and Maureen is gonna take
a skip on down to New Orleans.

07:24.911 --> 07:27.438
I wouldn't go makin' any big
travel plans for a while.

07:27.538 --> 07:29.007
Is that an order?

07:29.607 --> 07:31.112
Just a feeling.

07:46.649 --> 07:48.651
We are so late.

07:50.044 --> 07:51.421
- Bruce, give me my vest.
- Look.

07:51.521 --> 07:52.572
Oh, gee.

07:52.672 --> 07:53.948
I gotta get my shoe.

07:54.048 --> 07:55.208
Hurry up!

07:55.308 --> 07:57.311
Your dad's gonna kick my butt
if we're late for this thing.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.471
Would you hurry?

07:59.971 --> 08:01.975
My hair is gonna be a mess.

08:02.276 --> 08:03.280
Ok.

08:04.642 --> 08:06.467
- All right, get on.
- Ok.

08:06.568 --> 08:07.828
Let's go.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.441
- Hang on!
- Ok.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.881
If I know Bruce,
he's gonna make a grand entrance.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.054
We should have told her
to come with us.

08:41.255 --> 08:43.731
Well, they probably just wanted
a little privacy.

08:43.831 --> 08:44.831
Privacy?

08:45.099 --> 08:47.692
You know, dad. Privacy.

08:49.537 --> 08:51.588
Jolene, that's disgusting.

08:54.150 --> 08:55.359
What did I tell you?

09:02.200 --> 09:04.284
And you thought
they weren't coming, reverend.

09:06.204 --> 09:08.580
Well, I figured
they'd show sooner or later.

09:14.879 --> 09:17.699
Ooh, does your old man
look ticked or what?

09:17.799 --> 09:20.175
I told you! I told you!

09:26.023 --> 09:27.275
Hello!

09:27.375 --> 09:28.901
Where have you two been?

09:29.001 --> 09:30.737
- Hey, mom!
- Sorry, Mrs. Dahlberg.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.346
Hi, reverend Walker.

09:33.506 --> 09:36.517
Hey, buddy. Keep this in your pocket
till I ask you for it.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.453
- You got that?
- You bet.

09:38.653 --> 09:39.804
Hi, Bruce.

09:39.904 --> 09:41.922
Well, shall we all get started?

09:43.825 --> 09:45.360
I'm sorry we're late.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.613
Sparrow 3-5 requesting
permission to land.

09:48.913 --> 09:51.941
Sparrow 3-5,
this is Oscar one control.

09:52.041 --> 09:55.252
You're cleared to land,
winds are 230 at 10.

09:55.378 --> 09:56.696
Roger, Oscar one.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.255
What are you bringing in?

09:58.381 --> 09:59.915
Dropping off a maintenance team.

10:23.631 --> 10:26.600
There's no site checks due, sir,
no problems with the personnel,

10:26.700 --> 10:28.704
- no weather reports.
- Sounds good.

10:29.704 --> 10:31.397
Stand ready to authenticate.

10:31.497 --> 10:34.917
Delta, echo, foxtrot,
golf, hotel, victor.

10:35.017 --> 10:36.017
Thank you.

10:53.877 --> 10:55.255
- How's it going?
- Good.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.223
- How's the weather topside?
- Oh, just fine.

10:58.423 --> 10:59.934
- Morning.
- How are you doin'?

11:00.904 --> 11:02.209
What do you have for us today?

11:02.319 --> 11:03.829
Everything looks to be normal.

11:04.009 --> 11:05.106
L.F. Status?

11:05.206 --> 11:06.608
All facilities are clean and green,

11:06.708 --> 11:08.109
with the exception of Oscar 11.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.410
We have maintenance on site
for 2 more hours.

11:16.225 --> 11:19.069
Gee, dad, your schedule's busier
than the president's.

11:19.169 --> 11:20.837
Maybe I should run for office.

11:20.963 --> 11:22.498
What, do I have to make an appointment

11:22.598 --> 11:24.726
for open heart surgery or something
to get an hour with you?

11:24.826 --> 11:26.628
Hey, what's eating you, fruitcake?

11:27.078 --> 11:29.080
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just jumpy.

11:29.300 --> 11:31.500
Don't say I sound like mom, please.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.886
You saw 60 minutes last night.

11:34.626 --> 11:36.428
No. Come on, I'm taking you

11:36.528 --> 11:37.997
someplace you work right next to,

11:38.097 --> 11:40.642
and I bet never been inside
in 15 years.

11:41.042 --> 11:42.278
Well, come on.

11:43.878 --> 11:47.515
Sometimes it's hard to know
how to experience a Chinese landscape

11:47.615 --> 11:51.060
because the artist doesn't tell you
where you're watching from,

11:51.160 --> 11:53.563
like in a Turner,
or a Corot or something.

11:53.663 --> 11:55.064
You know why?

11:55.264 --> 11:57.770
Because he wants you
to be in the landscape,

11:57.870 --> 12:00.870
a part of it,
not out here looking at it.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.416
You mean a God's eye
point of view.

12:05.816 --> 12:08.277
No. Well, yes,
if by God you mean

12:08.377 --> 12:10.929
everywhere and inside
sort of thing, yeah.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.167
You've got that funny in-between look.

12:23.267 --> 12:24.794
In between what?

12:25.594 --> 12:29.430
In between knowing whether
you should tell me something or not.

12:31.467 --> 12:33.285
Ok, daddy.

12:33.886 --> 12:35.686
I'm moving to Boston.

12:39.876 --> 12:41.326
How come?

12:41.452 --> 12:44.522
See? That's why
I didn't wanna tell you right away.

12:45.022 --> 12:49.110
I have to deal with your hurt
feelings, and mom's, not just...

12:49.210 --> 12:51.060
All I asked was why.

12:52.346 --> 12:55.340
Pop, it's time for me to leave home.

12:55.475 --> 12:58.894
But you haven't been
living at home for 2 years.

12:59.562 --> 13:01.506
An apartment 26 blocks away

13:01.606 --> 13:04.274
isn't exactly Independence,
Missouri, you know.

13:06.402 --> 13:09.846
Of course, choosing Boston
wouldn't have anything to do with...

13:10.198 --> 13:12.016
- What's his name?
- Gary.

13:12.116 --> 13:14.784
Gary starting Tufts medical this fall?

13:14.894 --> 13:15.894
No.

13:17.355 --> 13:19.406
Well, maybe a little.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.258
But it's not like we're going to be

13:21.426 --> 13:22.751
living together or anything.

13:23.820 --> 13:25.312
At least not right away.

13:27.256 --> 13:29.858
Growing up,
it's like growing apart.

13:30.927 --> 13:32.677
Maybe it's a natural phenomenon.

13:37.433 --> 13:38.808
Have you told your mother?

13:39.352 --> 13:40.352
Uh, tomorrow.

13:40.628 --> 13:42.836
I thought I'd start with you
and work my way up.

13:42.939 --> 13:44.140
Oh, I'm easy.

13:44.340 --> 13:45.899
Easier.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.028
It's not so easy, you know.

13:50.404 --> 13:51.404
What?

13:52.807 --> 13:54.032
Saying goodbye.

13:54.408 --> 13:56.394
If I go re-booking that plane ticket,

13:56.494 --> 13:58.203
man, I'm gonna lose my super saver.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.914
Don't know why you're flying
to New Orleans anyway.

14:01.207 --> 14:02.499
You ought to drive down.

14:02.625 --> 14:05.877
Visit all those pretty nice old plantations
down around Natchez.

14:06.237 --> 14:08.747
- Take one of them steamboat rides.
- Ok?

14:54.260 --> 14:55.760
Come on, you guys.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.099
- Kenny, come on!
- All right! All right!

15:21.896 --> 15:23.446
Hey, get my bag, will you?

15:31.505 --> 15:33.491
What did they say is wrong
with this thing anyway?

15:33.591 --> 15:34.791
Won't fly.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.377
Hey, Willie,
we got a silo here, man.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.894
Mommy, can I make cookies?

15:46.062 --> 15:48.121
You can't make cookies.
You're only 4.

15:48.481 --> 15:49.773
You could show me.

15:49.982 --> 15:51.816
Sure, kids. Go ahead.
But clean up.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.517
Since NATO's insistence on

15:59.617 --> 16:01.910
positioning medium-range
Pershing-2s

16:02.044 --> 16:06.289
and cruise missiles in Europe
has caused Great Britain

16:06.389 --> 16:08.693
to re-evaluate its own
nuclear commitment.

16:08.793 --> 16:11.311
Scrub it all together
if the labor party had its way.

16:11.412 --> 16:14.706
You see, the real fear is
that when the chips are down,

16:14.907 --> 16:16.357
and the red light's blinking,

16:16.859 --> 16:18.744
the United States won't really want

16:18.844 --> 16:20.887
to sacrifice Chicago for Hamburg.

16:21.513 --> 16:24.375
Our correspondent in Europe
confirmed that

16:24.475 --> 16:26.476
according to NATO intelligence reports,

16:26.644 --> 16:29.729
as of this morning,
there are now three Soviet tank divisions

16:29.897 --> 16:31.748
poised along the Fulda gap.

16:32.108 --> 16:34.317
The United States issued a strong protest

16:34.610 --> 16:37.497
regarding the Soviet presence
in an emergency session

16:37.597 --> 16:39.598
of the U.N. Security council
this morning.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.242
A protest responded to
indirectly this afternoon

16:42.345 --> 16:45.613
by Soviet-born ministers
meeting in Brussels for trade talks

16:45.716 --> 16:46.897
with the common market.

16:46.997 --> 16:50.192
Speaking with A.B.C. News,
the Soviet-born minister claims

16:50.292 --> 16:52.544
the United States
have the cart before the horse...

16:54.964 --> 16:57.491
You can answer one question, can't you?
That won't hurt you none.

16:57.591 --> 16:58.800
All right, one question.

16:58.909 --> 17:00.109
- But remember...
- Where's Alan?

17:00.653 --> 17:03.062
Oh, he's over at Jackson's,
having supper.

17:04.181 --> 17:05.990
They had a varsity scrimmage at 7:00.

17:06.892 --> 17:09.344
He doesn't spend much time
around here, does he?

17:09.837 --> 17:11.128
Who does?

17:12.089 --> 17:13.330
Looks like I'm here.

17:14.275 --> 17:17.310
Yeah, that's kinda nice.

17:17.737 --> 17:18.737
Thank you.

17:19.888 --> 17:22.173
I thought you taught hematology
at Lawrence tonight.

17:22.282 --> 17:24.325
Sam's taking my classes for me.

17:25.035 --> 17:29.247
I'm, uh, going out tomorrow afternoon.

17:29.565 --> 17:31.169
Want to go to the movies, tonight?

17:32.426 --> 17:35.954
We could go to the Fern Hill
drive-in and neck.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.601
Well, what if we just stayed in?

17:40.701 --> 17:42.705
Yeah, suits me fine.
We'll light a few candles

17:42.805 --> 17:44.481
and put on some raunchy music.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.049
What's gotten into you?

17:48.225 --> 17:49.784
What, you don't like my ideas?

17:49.977 --> 17:51.791
I love your ideas.

17:51.892 --> 17:53.288
It's just that you're...

17:55.591 --> 17:58.818
Oh, you've been talking to Marilyn,
haven't you?

17:59.278 --> 18:03.907
Yeah. She told me about the scholarship,
and, uh, Boston.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.802
She said you were just
marvelous about it.

18:08.562 --> 18:10.246
I think I handled myself pretty well.

18:13.275 --> 18:16.211
It's good to see her
so excited about the move.

18:18.072 --> 18:19.647
Is that what's important?

18:20.541 --> 18:22.559
How excited she is?

18:25.688 --> 18:29.557
She'd follow Gary and that old rattletrap
to Nome or new Mexico.

18:30.084 --> 18:32.486
She only applied to Boston because...

18:32.586 --> 18:34.604
- Wait a minute, let me turn this up now, will you?
- Please, listen...

18:34.814 --> 18:36.723
I have been listening to that thing all day...

18:36.825 --> 18:38.717
...the blockade of West Berlin continues.

18:38.926 --> 18:42.382
The action follows reports earlier
this evening of widespread rebellion

18:42.488 --> 18:44.881
among several divisions
of the East German army.

18:45.032 --> 18:46.132
To repeat:

18:46.242 --> 18:49.452
East Germany tonight
sealed off the borders to West Berlin,

18:49.703 --> 18:52.690
closing the four principal
West German access corridors

18:52.790 --> 18:56.584
at Lauenberg, Helmstedt,
Herleshausen and Rudolphstein.

18:56.777 --> 18:58.311
I don't believe this is happening.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.548
Do you want to go in the living room
and watch?

19:04.060 --> 19:05.277
No.

19:07.721 --> 19:09.889
I just want to go upstairs
and get into bed

19:11.600 --> 19:13.093
with you.

19:15.896 --> 19:18.716
And Audie's got some kind of
stag party planned anyhow.

19:18.816 --> 19:22.652
So tonight's the last night
we'll see each other till Sunday.

19:22.945 --> 19:25.014
Yeah, but ma's still fittin' my gown.

19:25.114 --> 19:27.198
Hey, you know what?
No one's up at Arthur's tonight.

19:27.449 --> 19:28.783
They're all in town at the game.

19:30.452 --> 19:33.329
And it's not like we haven't
ever made love before, Bruce.

19:34.248 --> 19:36.275
Not without you getting sick on the pill,

19:36.375 --> 19:37.584
or rolling off the haystack...

19:40.004 --> 19:41.963
They're right over there.

19:47.177 --> 19:48.970
Can't you wait 2 more days?

19:50.973 --> 19:51.973
No.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.893
You're crazy.
You know that?

19:59.440 --> 20:00.440
Where is it?

20:01.275 --> 20:02.442
Upstairs.

20:03.068 --> 20:04.485
In my dressing table drawer.

20:05.112 --> 20:06.613
A lot of good
it's doing up there.

20:07.990 --> 20:11.034
Go get it. Go on.

20:12.453 --> 20:14.829
Come on, go get it.

20:52.368 --> 20:53.701
Jolene?

20:54.578 --> 20:56.454
Jolene, you give that
back to me!

20:56.664 --> 20:59.290
Jolene! Jolene!

21:00.376 --> 21:01.876
You brat, come here!

21:02.294 --> 21:04.029
Jolene, if I catch you,
I'm gonna kill you!

21:04.129 --> 21:05.823
Jolene, come on!

21:05.923 --> 21:08.299
We interrupt this program
to bring you a special report.

21:08.425 --> 21:11.287
East Germany tonight tightened
its stranglehold on West Berlin

21:11.387 --> 21:15.807
by halting all air traffic in and out
of Tegel and Tempelhof airports,

21:15.933 --> 21:18.184
severing the city's lifeline
to the west.

21:18.602 --> 21:21.437
This action has been condemned
by NATO foreign ministers

21:21.647 --> 21:25.191
as a blatant, unconscionable
violation of international law.

21:25.359 --> 21:27.151
Jolene! Jolene!

21:28.112 --> 21:28.903
Jolene!

21:29.071 --> 21:30.055
Jolene!

21:30.155 --> 21:31.155
Jolene!

21:36.203 --> 21:37.578
Jolene!

21:39.957 --> 21:45.169
Jolene, you open this door
right now,

21:45.295 --> 21:47.046
or I'll never talk to you again!

21:48.465 --> 21:49.966
Jolene!

21:50.175 --> 21:51.676
Tomorrow Berlin time,

21:51.927 --> 21:54.303
that's 6:00 A.M.
eastern daylight time,

21:54.513 --> 21:56.723
would be regarded
as an act of war.

21:57.224 --> 21:59.418
After an emergency meeting
with his cabinet

21:59.518 --> 22:01.477
and congressional leaders
of both parties,

22:01.770 --> 22:05.424
the president tonight declared all
United States military personnel

22:05.524 --> 22:07.775
on worldwide stage-2 alert.

22:08.193 --> 22:10.445
Soviet ambassador
Anatoli Kuragin

22:10.738 --> 22:13.740
was summoned to the White House
3 quarters of an hour ago.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.450
She was in my...

22:23.834 --> 22:24.834
Well?

22:27.296 --> 22:29.922
All right. You don't
have to tell me.

22:30.340 --> 22:33.160
But I expect the two of you to
settle it amongst yourselves.

22:33.260 --> 22:36.220
Otherwise I'll see that your
father settles it for you.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.918
Now Jolene, I could sure use
some help with the casseroles

22:41.018 --> 22:42.018
when you're through.

22:43.312 --> 22:44.937
Give that to me, you brat.

22:47.441 --> 22:49.650
Press secretary
David Townes reports

22:49.943 --> 22:52.904
that both sides are engaged
in frank and earnest talks

22:53.155 --> 22:57.700
aimed at finding ways to defuse the
heightening crisis in Berlin...

22:58.702 --> 23:00.953
Oh, god! It's 1962
all over again.

23:01.955 --> 23:03.706
Cuban missile crisis.

23:06.418 --> 23:08.252
Do you remember
Kennedy on television

23:08.420 --> 23:10.322
telling Khrushchev to
turn his boats around?

23:10.422 --> 23:13.174
Full retaliatory response.
He didn't bat an eye.

23:16.178 --> 23:18.387
We were in New York, in bed.

23:18.847 --> 23:20.765
Just like this, remember?

23:21.225 --> 23:23.267
118th street.

23:23.393 --> 23:25.937
Meatball sandwiches
from Sharkey's.

23:26.897 --> 23:28.898
Your last year's residency.

23:31.276 --> 23:34.570
I swear that we made Marilyn
that night.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.240
Then we got up,

23:38.200 --> 23:40.743
went to the window,
and looked for the bombs.

23:41.537 --> 23:43.162
It didn't happen.

23:46.083 --> 23:47.792
It's not gonna happen now.

23:49.002 --> 23:51.087
People are crazy,
but not that crazy.

23:51.547 --> 23:54.173
Well, do you want to know
from crazy?

23:57.469 --> 23:59.345
The Donnellys left today
for Guadalajara.

24:00.264 --> 24:01.206
Guadalajara?

24:01.306 --> 24:03.975
I swear it. I spoke to her
as they were pulling out.

24:04.852 --> 24:07.061
He said they were dovetailing
their vacation

24:07.813 --> 24:09.689
with the rising
international tensions.

24:09.857 --> 24:11.482
Oh, cut it out.

24:11.984 --> 24:12.984
I'm not kidding.

24:13.402 --> 24:15.361
They took their
Vietnamese maid with them.

24:15.988 --> 24:19.991
And that rotten
little barking dog

24:20.200 --> 24:21.602
with the pushed-in face.

24:21.702 --> 24:23.578
Oh, what about their little, uh,

24:23.704 --> 24:28.124
combination tractor lawn mower
golf cart with the silver hubcaps?

24:29.293 --> 24:30.459
Probably.

24:38.719 --> 24:40.094
What if it does happen?

24:42.931 --> 24:43.931
What do we do?

26:02.594 --> 26:04.679
You told me nothing like this
was ever gonna happen.

26:06.181 --> 26:08.250
Maureen, it's just an alert.
That's all.

26:08.350 --> 26:11.936
I mean, we got to run around and check
things twice instead of once. That's it.

26:12.437 --> 26:13.980
What am I going
to tell my mother?

26:14.189 --> 26:16.315
She's got the house all set,
a room for skip...

26:16.441 --> 26:17.692
Well, why don't you go on down?

26:18.902 --> 26:20.888
No, no, I'm serious. Honey,
why don't you just take skip,

26:20.988 --> 26:24.323
go down to your mother's, and then I'll just
join you when this whole thing is over.

26:24.741 --> 26:26.033
That's just great.

26:32.791 --> 26:34.166
Oh, Billy, I'm sorry.

26:35.752 --> 26:38.045
I know I'm not making this
any easier on you.

26:39.881 --> 26:41.382
I love you.

26:42.676 --> 26:44.051
Know that?

26:46.805 --> 26:48.514
I love you, too, Maureen.

26:49.933 --> 26:52.336
Just 5-and-a-half months,
that's it.

26:52.436 --> 26:53.337
5-and-a-half months,

26:53.437 --> 26:54.546
and I'll be out of the service.

26:54.646 --> 26:56.256
I'll be working 40 hours a week,

26:56.356 --> 26:58.316
making $17.50
per hour.

26:59.484 --> 27:00.943
You're taking everything
you've got?

27:01.695 --> 27:03.612
Damn it, Maureen, it's an alert!

27:04.865 --> 27:07.283
It's 4 sets of everything.

27:07.492 --> 27:10.036
It's just strictly by the book.

27:10.746 --> 27:12.455
I'm scared is what.

27:12.831 --> 27:14.081
Look, sit down.

27:15.625 --> 27:18.002
Maureen, there's
nothing to worry about.

27:18.587 --> 27:20.046
I'm gonna be right next door.

27:20.255 --> 27:22.324
I'm gonna be on the base
the whole time,

27:22.424 --> 27:24.050
and I'll call you every night.

27:25.510 --> 27:26.510
Ok?

27:27.888 --> 27:28.888
It's all right.

28:03.465 --> 28:04.840
Good morning, Mizzou!

28:05.008 --> 28:08.344
It's 5:30, clear skies, and 61
degrees in St. Clair county.

28:08.637 --> 28:10.414
There's a little rain
moving this way tonight.

28:10.514 --> 28:12.848
And this is the
W.W.I.Z. Farm report

28:13.016 --> 28:14.975
for Saturday, September 16th.

28:15.435 --> 28:18.979
Here's the commodity markets report
on the Chicago board of trade...

28:42.003 --> 28:43.003
Cows are out.

28:47.676 --> 28:49.510
What do you say you and
me get some breakfast?

28:56.852 --> 29:00.088
The White House today issued
a strong denial that the U.S.

29:00.188 --> 29:02.690
Contemplated any unilateral
military action

29:02.899 --> 29:05.693
in response to the deteriorating
situation in East Germany.

29:05.944 --> 29:08.680
Press secretary David Townes,
speaking for the president,

29:08.780 --> 29:12.700
unequivocally stated the administration
support for the NATO pact alliance...

29:28.717 --> 29:29.717
Bye.

29:41.646 --> 29:42.646
Denise?

29:46.568 --> 29:48.152
Where in hell have you been?

29:54.993 --> 29:56.702
Don't you just walk right by me

29:56.828 --> 29:58.454
when you hear me
asking you a question.

29:58.705 --> 30:00.581
What are you doing
sneaking in here?

30:01.374 --> 30:03.443
I'm not sneaking.
I never sneak.

30:03.543 --> 30:05.586
Then why didn't you
come in the back door?

30:06.421 --> 30:08.756
I didn't even know
the door was unlocked, daddy.

30:10.467 --> 30:12.009
I've been out with Bruce,
riding around.

30:12.260 --> 30:13.511
Riding around.

30:15.305 --> 30:16.305
All night.

30:18.600 --> 30:22.269
Frankly, daddy, that's
none of your business.

30:28.944 --> 30:30.694
As long as you live...

30:31.446 --> 30:33.280
Oh, daddy,
please don't say that.

30:33.949 --> 30:35.950
Because I'm getting
married tomorrow.

30:36.868 --> 30:38.118
Jolene!

30:38.620 --> 30:40.856
You get back in there
and stop eavesdropping.

30:40.956 --> 30:42.414
I'm not eavesdropping.

30:42.832 --> 30:44.500
I'm just waiting for you
to finish up

30:44.668 --> 30:46.335
so I can get by to the bathroom.

30:46.711 --> 30:49.213
Well, use the one outside
the kitchen, honey.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.382
The water is freezing out there.

30:51.633 --> 30:53.467
Well, hurry it up,
for Pete's sake!

30:57.556 --> 31:00.599
Can't you see
that we're talking?

31:00.725 --> 31:03.060
The whole world's
just holding its breath

31:03.186 --> 31:05.229
to hear what you're
talking about.

31:06.106 --> 31:08.023
What is all the commotion
out there?

31:13.071 --> 31:14.113
Nothing, Evie.

31:16.825 --> 31:18.701
Honey, let's just
forget what I said.

31:21.162 --> 31:22.538
You're no sneak.

31:38.555 --> 31:39.763
Hut 1, hut 2!

31:45.145 --> 31:47.104
Coach seems to know what
he's doing this year.

31:47.230 --> 31:49.189
I mean he's teaching
those kids good.

31:49.691 --> 31:51.066
Yeah, they sure look good.

31:51.318 --> 31:53.861
Yep. You got a boy
out there?

31:54.154 --> 31:56.322
Yeah, yeah. Number 80.
Alan Oakes.

31:56.489 --> 31:59.267
Oh, yeah. I've been
watching him. Got good hands.

31:59.367 --> 32:03.829
Good hands, good moves to the outside.
He's not afraid to take a hit.

32:04.456 --> 32:05.899
Do you have a son playing?

32:05.999 --> 32:08.709
Yeah. Doug Holland.
Number 68.

32:09.044 --> 32:10.961
He's only a sophomore.

32:11.171 --> 32:14.465
Yeah, he's a born guard,
though, you know? Stocky.

32:14.758 --> 32:15.758
All heart.

32:16.718 --> 32:19.345
I try not to miss a practice
when I'm not on the road.

32:19.721 --> 32:20.747
I don't like to embarrass him

32:20.847 --> 32:22.431
by hangin' around the bench.

32:23.266 --> 32:25.225
Oh, by the way,
I'm... I'm Doug senior.

32:25.352 --> 32:27.186
Oh! Russ Oakes.
Nice to meet you.

32:27.604 --> 32:28.604
Same here.

32:29.689 --> 32:32.191
Well, see you, Doug.

32:32.359 --> 32:33.651
Ok, bye.

32:46.081 --> 32:47.539
That NATO armored units

32:47.707 --> 32:50.167
have broken through the Helmstedt
checkpoint into East Germany,

32:51.002 --> 32:53.879
and, after heavy fighting, are
advancing under air support

32:54.005 --> 32:56.199
2 miles along the E-8
Bundestrasse corridor

32:56.299 --> 32:57.925
past Marienborn, toward Berlin.

32:59.302 --> 33:01.621
French news agency has
received conflicting reports

33:01.721 --> 33:04.181
of east German resistance
and heavy casualties.

33:04.891 --> 33:06.558
But ground observers
have confirmed

33:06.685 --> 33:10.145
that 2 Soviet-built Mig-25s
invaded West German airspace,

33:10.522 --> 33:12.356
firing several
air-to-ground missiles

33:12.482 --> 33:14.358
at a NATO munitions
storage facility,

33:14.526 --> 33:17.528
and also hitting a school and a
hospital outside of Wurzburg.

33:22.826 --> 33:25.160
While we save
a single blue baby,

33:25.578 --> 33:29.164
they're bombing hospitals
in Wurzburg.

33:30.041 --> 33:32.543
I'm afraid of listening
to the radio anymore.

33:33.628 --> 33:34.962
Have you heard the latest?

33:36.172 --> 33:39.633
There is a rumor they're
evacuating Moscow. Yeah.

33:41.052 --> 33:43.554
There are even people
leaving Kansas City

33:43.847 --> 33:45.556
because of the missile fields.

33:46.349 --> 33:49.435
Where does one go
from Kansas City?

33:50.061 --> 33:53.647
To, uh, the Yukon?
To Tahiti?

33:55.692 --> 33:58.485
We are not talking
about Hiroshima anymore.

33:58.611 --> 34:01.321
Hiroshima was... was peanuts.

34:01.990 --> 34:03.907
What's going on?

34:06.494 --> 34:10.121
Do you understand what's
going on in this world?

34:10.290 --> 34:14.251
Yeah. Stupidity has a
habit of getting its way.

34:14.668 --> 34:17.170
Dr. Oakes to
nurses' station "r"...

34:18.505 --> 34:19.255
Yes?

34:19.424 --> 34:22.009
Oh, Dr. Oakes. Your wife
would like you to call her.

34:22.135 --> 34:23.203
Oh, thank you.

34:23.303 --> 34:25.080
City of Moscow
is being evacuated.

34:25.179 --> 34:27.514
According to informed
administration sources,

34:27.724 --> 34:29.850
the city of Moscow
is being evacuated.

34:36.983 --> 34:40.053
It is not generally known in
Washington at the present time

34:40.152 --> 34:44.197
whether the evacuation order indicates
the entire population of Moscow,

34:44.449 --> 34:47.518
or whether other major Soviet
cities have been similarly affected

34:47.619 --> 34:49.369
by the evacuation order.

35:20.151 --> 35:21.177
Sam, yeah?

35:21.277 --> 35:22.444
Where's Dr. Oakes?

35:22.612 --> 35:24.738
Oh, he's probably stuck
in traffic on the I-70.

35:25.031 --> 35:28.033
Hey, haven't you heard?
Everyone's gone fishing.

35:29.244 --> 35:30.244
Who's in charge?

35:30.453 --> 35:32.579
Good question.
Montoya's in K.C.

35:32.705 --> 35:35.541
And Julian wants staff informed
of emergency procedures

35:35.667 --> 35:37.318
in case a general
Metro evacuation is ordered.

35:37.418 --> 35:38.460
So he needs a medical...

35:38.628 --> 35:39.962
Oh, no. Not me, Bauer.

35:40.088 --> 35:43.257
See, I'm just a resident with
120 freshmen bodies to examine.

35:43.633 --> 35:46.301
Unfortunately, most
of them are male.

35:46.594 --> 35:48.011
Nice try.

35:50.139 --> 35:51.390
It's just like the army.

35:51.891 --> 35:53.767
Yeah. I wonder where
we're gonna be next week.

35:53.935 --> 35:55.435
Somewhere in
the upper atmosphere.

36:06.681 --> 36:07.682
Name?

36:07.782 --> 36:09.257
Stephen Klein.

36:09.826 --> 36:13.280
K-l-e-i-n.

36:15.004 --> 36:16.211
Japanese?

36:17.484 --> 36:19.652
- Age?
- 19.

36:19.752 --> 36:21.128
- Residence?
- Joplin.

36:21.296 --> 36:22.530
No, I mean, on campus.

36:22.630 --> 36:24.631
Oh! uh, Davidson 4.

36:25.508 --> 36:26.550
What's your major, Stephen?

36:26.718 --> 36:27.718
Pre-med.

36:28.428 --> 36:30.028
He's shooting baskets at the "Y."

36:30.138 --> 36:32.598
He knows better.
This is my 2nd false alarm.

36:32.807 --> 36:33.891
I'm 10 days early.

36:34.058 --> 36:36.061
I'm an attention-grabber,
he says.

36:36.202 --> 36:37.209
Where's yours?

36:37.310 --> 36:38.582
- My what?
- Your husband.

36:38.685 --> 36:41.570
Oh, he's trying to catch a plane out
right about now.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.010
So what's he got to do
with anything?

36:44.110 --> 36:45.386
I'm not the one having the baby.

36:45.486 --> 36:47.706
- Yeah. What's it like?
- What?

36:47.806 --> 36:49.499
You know, having a baby.
What's it feel like?

36:49.599 --> 36:50.699
Never had one.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.100
But you said, "I know."

36:52.585 --> 36:54.484
- I know what?
- Back at emergency.

36:54.585 --> 36:56.538
I was tellin' you about the pains,
and you said, "I know."

36:56.664 --> 36:59.374
I know about the pains because
I'm a nurse who's seen a lot like you.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.126
Yeah. You want to know
what it feels like?

37:01.544 --> 37:03.754
It feels like I'm gonna
have a basketball.

37:08.676 --> 37:09.718
Where is everybody?

37:10.345 --> 37:11.845
They're all watching the news.

37:12.055 --> 37:14.806
Say, I saw Ticker and
Judy Francis takin' off,

37:15.224 --> 37:16.808
thumbs out, backpacks and all.

37:18.895 --> 37:19.978
So what are you doing here?

37:20.188 --> 37:21.506
Holding my place in line.

37:21.606 --> 37:23.424
If I don't get into Bowman's
metallurgy class this semester,

37:23.524 --> 37:24.983
I'm not gonna graduate in January.

37:31.366 --> 37:32.532
Hey, what's goin' on?

37:34.243 --> 37:36.453
They say the Russians
just invaded West Germany.

37:37.455 --> 37:40.707
3-pronged attack, spearheaded
by rapid Soviet tank

37:40.833 --> 37:42.834
and artillery advances
into the Fulda gap.

37:43.419 --> 37:45.572
Having already captured
NATO advance positions

37:45.672 --> 37:47.073
along the West German border.

37:47.173 --> 37:50.801
How far will
Warsaw pact forces go?

37:51.260 --> 37:53.553
Will the Russians advance
straight for the Rhine

37:53.680 --> 37:56.916
and defy NATO's declared policy
of defense by all means,

37:57.016 --> 37:59.476
including the use of
tactical nuclear weapons?

38:00.269 --> 38:01.853
The defense department today
reported...

38:01.980 --> 38:02.980
Fantasy land.

38:03.898 --> 38:05.216
You think they're
making this up?

38:05.316 --> 38:07.609
You think this is war of
the worlds or something?

38:08.194 --> 38:10.570
Look, did we help the Czechs,
the Hungarians,

38:10.738 --> 38:12.656
the Afghans, or the Poles?

38:12.824 --> 38:15.852
Well, we're not going to nuke the
Russians to save the Germans.

38:15.952 --> 38:18.453
I mean, if you were talking
oil in Saudi Arabia,

38:18.621 --> 38:19.788
then I'd be real worried.

38:20.623 --> 38:21.665
What do you think?

38:24.669 --> 38:25.961
I gotta get a haircut.

38:30.341 --> 38:33.218
You know, I think I'm going
to hitch home, see my folks,

38:34.053 --> 38:35.679
and I'll see what's
happening on Monday.

38:35.847 --> 38:36.596
Where do you live?

38:36.806 --> 38:37.931
Joplin?

38:41.310 --> 38:42.310
You going to Joplin?

38:46.024 --> 38:48.233
Hey, son, hop in.
I'll give you a ride.

38:48.526 --> 38:49.526
Oh, great.

38:56.909 --> 39:00.412
Make it pretty, Ollie. This is
my last trim as a free man.

39:01.247 --> 39:02.622
I'm getting married tomorrow.

39:03.458 --> 39:04.359
Is that right?

39:04.459 --> 39:05.234
Yeah.

39:05.334 --> 39:07.294
Well, congratulations.

39:07.462 --> 39:10.422
Who knows? The president's speaking
on television at 6:00 tonight.

39:10.548 --> 39:11.783
Maybe he'll tell us
something new.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.508
They'll tell us what
they want us to hear.

39:13.676 --> 39:15.453
Keep the panic at
the low-sweat stage.

39:15.553 --> 39:17.455
I really don't think either
side wants to be the first

39:17.555 --> 39:18.680
to use a nuclear device.

39:19.140 --> 39:21.308
It's not a question of
who, but where?

39:21.684 --> 39:23.185
Over whose real estate?

39:23.436 --> 39:26.188
Say we explode a nuclear
bomb over their troops,

39:26.606 --> 39:29.759
on our side, the fallout better
not drift over to their side.

39:29.859 --> 39:30.859
They're crazy.

39:31.027 --> 39:33.262
How do they expect it's going
to stop with just one bomb?

39:33.362 --> 39:34.847
You want to know what crazy is?

39:34.947 --> 39:36.990
Crazy is not staying out of
other people's business.

39:37.742 --> 39:39.534
We shouldn't be over there
in the first place.

39:42.163 --> 39:43.622
Well, maybe they'll contain it.

39:45.374 --> 39:47.402
After all, I've still got
symphony tickets for tonight.

39:47.502 --> 39:49.821
Thing that bothers me is that
damned launch-on-warning.

39:49.921 --> 39:50.712
What's that?

39:50.838 --> 39:53.574
That's when one side tells the
other they are gonna fire missiles

39:53.674 --> 39:55.842
when they think the other guy's
missiles are on the way.

39:56.219 --> 39:57.928
You know, use 'em or lose 'em.

39:59.764 --> 40:02.208
What do you really think the chances
are of something like that happening

40:02.308 --> 40:03.960
way the hell out here
in the middle of nowhere?

40:04.060 --> 40:05.060
Nowhere?

40:06.562 --> 40:08.146
There's no "nowhere" anymore.

40:08.773 --> 40:10.967
You're sitting next to the
Whiteman air force base right now.

40:11.067 --> 40:14.345
That's a 150 minuteman
missile silos

40:14.445 --> 40:16.071
spread halfway down
the state of Missouri.

40:17.198 --> 40:20.659
That's an awful lot
of bull's eyes.

40:27.208 --> 40:29.193
Close to announcing a ceasefire

40:29.293 --> 40:30.669
along the German border.

40:30.962 --> 40:33.672
There are still no eyewitness
accounts to substantiate the rumor

40:33.798 --> 40:35.825
that low kiloton range
nuclear weapons

40:35.925 --> 40:37.660
were detonated this morning
during the conflict

40:37.760 --> 40:40.121
resulting in the reported
destruction of Wiesbaden

40:40.221 --> 40:41.763
and the outskirts of Frankfurt...

40:44.809 --> 40:47.477
This is the emergency
broadcast system.

40:47.937 --> 40:51.815
All persons in transit in the
Kansas City metropolitan area

40:52.191 --> 40:55.986
are advised to proceed immediately
to the municipal shelter facility

40:56.737 --> 40:59.698
in the community or township
closest to your current location.

41:00.283 --> 41:03.076
While there is no immediate
danger to the Kansas City area,

41:03.828 --> 41:06.496
the federal emergency
management agency urges

41:06.747 --> 41:10.750
that you learn the steps to be taken
in the event of a probable attack.

41:11.544 --> 41:12.987
Hey, there, Jim.

41:13.087 --> 41:14.713
Jim, why don't you go home now?

41:14.839 --> 41:16.282
Reverend, we got a lot more...

41:16.382 --> 41:18.618
Well, I know, I know. But you
got plenty to do at home.

41:18.718 --> 41:20.051
What good does the dirt do?

41:22.513 --> 41:23.847
Get on in the truck, son.

41:24.640 --> 41:26.725
Listen, fellows,
I'm gonna cut on out now.

41:26.893 --> 41:28.852
Good luck to you.

41:37.403 --> 41:40.348
As soon as we get home,
you line up some milk jugs,

41:40.448 --> 41:42.782
about half a dozen of 'em.
Put 'em beside the water pump.

41:43.159 --> 41:45.144
We're gonna fill 'em up
and take 'em to the cellar.

41:45.244 --> 41:46.453
Yes, sir.

41:50.583 --> 41:52.709
My... my kids just left
on a camping trip.

41:54.921 --> 41:56.671
I don't know how I'm going to...

41:57.381 --> 41:58.465
What I'm going to...

41:59.926 --> 42:01.134
Wait a minute, please.

42:12.855 --> 42:14.189
Hey, one minute now.

42:23.950 --> 42:25.158
urges that you learn

42:25.284 --> 42:27.535
the steps to be taken
in the event of a probable...

42:29.789 --> 42:31.665
Get out of my way.
I was here first.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.584
Just get the cash!

42:40.341 --> 42:42.467
Move your cart!
Hurry up! Move it.

43:07.159 --> 43:08.144
Any more news?

43:08.244 --> 43:10.245
They just hit one of our
ships in the Persian Gulf.

43:11.706 --> 43:12.706
Who's they?

43:12.957 --> 43:14.249
The Russians.
Who do you think?

43:14.458 --> 43:16.418
But we hit 'em back,
one of their ships, you know.

43:43.029 --> 43:44.279
Dallas?

43:44.780 --> 43:46.531
Give me a ride.

44:00.254 --> 44:02.964
Sarah, Kenny, wash up for lunch.
Come drink your milk.

44:05.551 --> 44:07.469
Wish those clouds
would hurry and open up.

44:07.595 --> 44:09.512
Could use one more good rain
before the cuttin'.

44:09.805 --> 44:11.473
Hey, did you kids hear me?

44:13.017 --> 44:14.100
Wait a few minutes.

44:14.268 --> 44:15.518
Oh, honey, the biscuits...

44:19.632 --> 44:22.667
That 3 nuclear weapons

44:23.235 --> 44:25.462
in the low kiloton range

44:26.055 --> 44:31.067
were air burst this morning
over advancing Soviet troops...

44:36.248 --> 44:37.817
- Soviet presence in East Germany.
- Oh, Kenny.

44:37.917 --> 44:39.542
Kenny, come on.

44:40.544 --> 44:41.544
Come on.

44:47.635 --> 44:49.537
And that both sides
are working together

44:49.637 --> 44:51.455
to bring about the earliest
possible ceasefire.

44:51.555 --> 44:53.890
We're flying out of here.
Prepare for take off.

44:54.058 --> 44:55.251
Can we make clear ground?

44:55.351 --> 44:56.476
Checking on it.

44:56.936 --> 44:57.977
Stand by, Starr.

44:58.145 --> 44:59.145
Get 'em up.

45:09.615 --> 45:10.850
The state department
says the president

45:10.950 --> 45:13.853
is presently in direct communication
with Soviet premier...

45:13.953 --> 45:18.248
Tango, 5, 3, 6, 1.

45:20.835 --> 45:22.778
Nuclear bomb
of undetermined strength

45:22.878 --> 45:25.505
has exploded at regional
NATO military headquarters...

45:27.007 --> 45:28.716
Takeoff, runway 3-1.

45:57.496 --> 45:58.505
Eve.

45:59.081 --> 46:00.206
Where are the girls?

46:00.416 --> 46:04.502
uh, Jolene's makin' beds,
and Denise is takin' a shower.

46:04.962 --> 46:06.337
Well, get 'em downstairs.

46:07.006 --> 46:09.883
Oh, Jim, can't you see
all I've got to do?

46:11.552 --> 46:14.888
Don't you know there's pretty much
a national emergency going on?

46:15.222 --> 46:17.265
Well, it's just going to have
to go on without me

46:17.391 --> 46:19.335
because your daughter
is getting married tomorrow,

46:19.435 --> 46:21.019
and I've got 67 mouths to feed.

46:21.812 --> 46:22.937
I hope so.

46:23.314 --> 46:25.356
But first we got to get
some things into the cellar.

46:26.108 --> 46:28.177
You'd think there's a tornado comin'.

46:28.277 --> 46:32.238
Daddy, the man on the radio
said there might be a war.

46:32.740 --> 46:34.908
He's saying, you know,
we should unplug all our radio

46:35.367 --> 46:36.993
and T.V. And stuff.

46:37.536 --> 46:39.621
There's not going to be a war, is there?

46:51.342 --> 46:52.884
Sir, we need access to the keys

46:53.010 --> 46:54.844
and the authentication
documents at this time.

46:55.262 --> 46:57.055
- Do you have your key?
- Yes, sir.

47:26.418 --> 47:27.919
I don't even know why we're doing this.

47:28.587 --> 47:31.923
Township closest to your current location.

47:32.216 --> 47:34.300
I'm sorry, I can't take you any further.

47:34.593 --> 47:35.885
That's ok. Thanks a lot.

47:36.136 --> 47:37.887
Good luck, now.
Yeah, you, too.

47:38.055 --> 47:40.265
Learn the steps to be taken

47:40.474 --> 47:42.600
in the event
of a probable attack.

48:31.734 --> 48:32.551
I gotta go.

48:32.651 --> 48:33.943
Stand by for the message.

48:39.199 --> 48:41.576
Alpha, 7, 8,

48:41.785 --> 48:43.661
November, foxtrot,

48:43.871 --> 48:46.706
1, 5, 2, 2...

48:49.126 --> 48:51.878
Castle, listen,
this is Oscar 11.

48:52.671 --> 48:54.005
We just started, sir. Why?

48:56.300 --> 48:57.925
We gotta get out of here.

48:58.552 --> 49:00.329
Standby to copy the message.

49:00.429 --> 49:01.262
Standing by.

49:01.388 --> 49:02.639
Message follows.

49:03.599 --> 49:05.850
That's a J.C.S. Execution
from the president.

49:05.976 --> 49:07.727
I agree the message
is valid, also.

49:07.853 --> 49:09.562
Launch keys inserted.

49:09.688 --> 49:10.855
Roger.

49:18.614 --> 49:21.199
Let's enable the missiles.
Program enable.

49:23.202 --> 49:24.285
Unlock code inserted.

49:24.536 --> 49:26.480
Stand by, unlock codes inserted.

49:26.580 --> 49:27.705
Enable switch. Enable.

49:28.332 --> 49:28.941
Enabled.

49:29.041 --> 49:30.625
Coordinate naval command.

49:30.959 --> 49:33.127
Yes, this is ops,
all enabled. Thank you.

49:34.129 --> 49:35.364
Key turn at my Mark.

49:35.464 --> 49:36.323
Standing by.

49:36.423 --> 49:37.965
5, 4...

50:12.126 --> 50:14.293
You kids come in here right now.

51:12.478 --> 51:13.644
Where's mama, honey?

51:14.354 --> 51:15.605
Upstairs.

51:16.648 --> 51:19.317
Now, I want you to take
those tarps and canvases

51:19.443 --> 51:21.027
down in the basement
like I told you.

51:21.737 --> 51:23.696
And stay there with Jolene,
you understand?

51:25.282 --> 51:26.282
Yes, daddy.

51:37.586 --> 51:39.504
Evie, don't bother
with the beds just now.

51:40.506 --> 51:42.882
Evie, we've got to get down below.
Listen.

51:44.051 --> 51:45.551
Those missiles have all gone off.

51:51.517 --> 51:53.392
No!

52:32.975 --> 52:34.392
Step on it.

52:36.019 --> 52:38.521
The gate, Willie,
watch the damn gate.

52:38.647 --> 52:40.022
I got it!
I got it!

52:45.779 --> 52:46.362
Hear anything?

52:46.655 --> 52:48.307
Are you in communications
with the capsule down there?

52:48.407 --> 52:50.449
Shuts down during a launch.
Even the radio went out.

52:50.784 --> 52:52.019
Last thing I heard
was they knocked out

52:52.119 --> 52:53.228
two of our radar warning stations.

52:53.328 --> 52:54.730
Where? Beale air force
base, California,

52:54.830 --> 52:56.122
and somewhere in England.

52:56.331 --> 52:58.708
Can you believe it?
They really gone and done it.

52:59.084 --> 53:00.986
They shacked 'em!
They pushed all the buttons.

53:01.086 --> 53:02.461
You know what that means, don't you?

53:02.713 --> 53:05.115
Either we fired first and
they're gonna try to hit what's left,

53:05.215 --> 53:08.217
or they fired first, and we just
got our missiles out of the ground in time.

53:09.052 --> 53:10.412
Either way,
we're going to get hit.

53:10.512 --> 53:11.862
So what are we standin' around here for?

53:11.964 --> 53:12.965
Where do you wanna go?

53:13.065 --> 53:15.626
How about out of here for starters?
I gotta get my wife and my kid.

53:15.726 --> 53:16.851
We're still on alert, Billy.

53:16.977 --> 53:18.233
No one leaves this facility.

53:18.334 --> 53:19.713
- Oh, come on, man.
- Not until the choppers come in.

53:19.813 --> 53:22.620
Are you kiddin' me, man?
The bombs will be here before the choppers will.

53:23.317 --> 53:24.592
Listen, listen to me, man.

53:24.693 --> 53:26.252
The war is over.

53:26.403 --> 53:28.696
It's over.
We've done our job.

53:29.197 --> 53:30.933
So what are you still guarding, huh?

53:31.033 --> 53:32.586
Some cotton-pickin' hole in the ground?

53:32.687 --> 53:34.394
- All dressed up and nowhere to go!
- He's right.

53:34.594 --> 53:36.996
What about Starr and Boyle?
What about 'em?

53:37.102 --> 53:38.106
What are they doin'?

53:38.206 --> 53:40.958
Yeah, they're 60 feet down,
sippin' cold beer and whistlin' 'Misty'.

53:41.084 --> 53:42.468
- Well, I'm goin' down there.
- Forget it, man.

53:42.636 --> 53:44.462
You can't go down there,
that elevator's secured.

53:44.755 --> 53:46.005
You hear yourself talkin', bozo?

53:46.256 --> 53:48.951
'Cause I hear you sayin' that we got
direct orders to be sittin' ducks!

53:49.051 --> 53:50.494
There's a ladder on the side of the shaft.

53:50.594 --> 53:53.121
So what?
They're still behind an 8-ton steel door

53:53.221 --> 53:54.414
with food and water for 2 weeks.

53:54.514 --> 53:55.541
They're not gonna let you in there.

53:55.641 --> 53:57.208
There's that little room out the elevator.

53:57.404 --> 53:58.809
Tommy, you know as well as I do

53:58.919 --> 54:01.922
that a direct hit'll take out the main
shaft and Boyle and Starr, too.

54:02.022 --> 54:03.689
I'd rather take my chances down there.

54:41.770 --> 54:43.396
Come on, Billy.
This was your idea.

54:44.564 --> 54:46.983
No, no hole in the ground was my idea.

54:48.276 --> 54:51.570
Yeah. Yeah, sure, man, come on.
Make up your mind.

54:52.155 --> 54:53.599
You gonna crawl down the hole

54:53.699 --> 54:55.157
or you gonna shoot me in the back?

54:55.659 --> 54:57.493
So, what does the book say, bozo?

55:27.774 --> 55:28.983
What's going on?

55:30.068 --> 55:31.318
Those are minuteman missiles.

55:33.238 --> 55:35.464
Like a test, sort of.
Like a warning?

55:37.893 --> 55:39.385
They're on their way to Russia.

55:43.498 --> 55:45.516
They take about 30 minutes
to reach their target.

55:46.626 --> 55:48.762
So do theirs, right?

55:48.862 --> 55:50.238
Missile warning, this is Beale.

55:50.338 --> 55:52.882
Confidence is high.
I repeat, confidence is high.

55:53.800 --> 55:55.869
Roger. We got 32 targets
in track

55:55.969 --> 55:57.970
and 10 impacting points.

55:59.014 --> 56:02.641
Wanna confirm,
is this an exercise?

56:04.770 --> 56:07.313
Roger, copy.
This is not an exercise.

56:07.439 --> 56:08.744
Roger. Understand.
Maj. Rinehart,

56:08.845 --> 56:10.946
we have a massive attack
against the U.S. at this time.

56:11.050 --> 56:13.326
I.C.B.Ms,
numerous I.C.B.Ms.

56:14.905 --> 56:15.931
Roger. Understand.

56:16.031 --> 56:17.633
Over 300 missiles inbound now.

56:42.515 --> 56:44.600
Do we have to go down there?

56:44.976 --> 56:47.228
Well, I guess we could stay
up here for a while.

56:47.395 --> 56:49.955
Uh, I think you better
go downstairs, folks, please.

57:05.539 --> 57:06.789
Hey!

57:58.241 --> 58:00.134
Oh, come on, baby,
don't die on me now.

59:25.428 --> 59:26.887
Danny! Don't look!

59:48.743 --> 59:49.743
I got you, son.

59:49.869 --> 59:50.869
It's all right.
I got you.

01:02:17.475 --> 01:02:21.270
That's Rusty.
Dad, we left Rusty.

01:02:23.815 --> 01:02:25.899
We might be down here a long time.

01:02:27.318 --> 01:02:29.403
There's not gonna be enough
food and water for Rusty.

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:32.239
You mean he's just going
to die out there?

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:40.289
Honey, we're going to have to get
used to things being a lot different.

01:02:41.416 --> 01:02:45.210
What matters is we're alive,

01:02:46.004 --> 01:02:47.504
and we're together.

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:50.132
It smells awful.

01:02:50.717 --> 01:02:52.718
How long will we
have to stay down here?

01:02:53.928 --> 01:02:58.015
I don't know. I don't know
anything about radiation.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.309
What's radiation?

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:43.560
Where did you get that?

01:03:44.062 --> 01:03:45.463
Near the broadcasting center,

01:03:45.563 --> 01:03:46.855
there's a museum in the basement,

01:03:47.106 --> 01:03:48.315
if it still works.

01:03:55.907 --> 01:03:58.575
These are getting scarcer
than hen's teeth.

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.478
You shouldn't have
stayed out so long looking.

01:04:00.578 --> 01:04:02.204
We need one for the shortwave.

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:04.732
I hope I don't go and blow myself up.

01:04:04.832 --> 01:04:06.625
I'm not sure about any of this.

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:08.835
Red is positive...

01:04:10.255 --> 01:04:11.505
Come on.

01:04:19.138 --> 01:04:21.765
Is this thing connected or is
Connie still up on the roof?

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:23.809
She should forget that stuff
and get down here.

01:04:44.163 --> 01:04:45.163
Here it comes.

01:04:54.882 --> 01:04:56.091
Where am I?

01:04:57.527 --> 01:04:59.412
- You're burned.
- Where's Dr. Montoya?

01:04:59.512 --> 01:05:00.517
Julian?

01:05:00.617 --> 01:05:01.821
Upstairs, putting out the fire.

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:02.957
3 is filled up.

01:05:03.057 --> 01:05:05.642
Yeah, get the beds in the
halls away from the window.

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:07.086
Have you seen the number
of people in here?

01:05:07.186 --> 01:05:09.005
This is supposed to double
as a fallout shelter.

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:10.548
They're standing
in shock or hysterical...

01:05:10.648 --> 01:05:13.150
Where's Dr. Wallenberg? She's
got the radiological equipment.

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:15.944
Listen, why don't
we have emergency power here?

01:05:16.195 --> 01:05:17.347
There's no electricity anywhere.

01:05:17.447 --> 01:05:19.281
Wh-what did you see?

01:05:20.241 --> 01:05:21.742
You were coming
from Kansas City.

01:05:22.535 --> 01:05:23.660
What did you see?

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:26.413
I was on the freeway,

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:29.875
about 30 miles away.

01:05:31.169 --> 01:05:32.210
I'm not sure.

01:05:34.172 --> 01:05:35.464
It was high in the air,

01:05:36.466 --> 01:05:39.635
directly above downtown.

01:05:41.512 --> 01:05:45.057
Like the sun exploding.

01:05:45.266 --> 01:05:47.684
I'm taking you into the hall.
You'll be safer here.

01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:49.811
Protect you from the fallout.

01:05:49.937 --> 01:05:52.314
It comes right through the windows,
through the walls and...

01:05:52.982 --> 01:05:54.941
Over to your right.

01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:57.929
Julian, Julian.
Oh, thank god you're here.

01:05:58.029 --> 01:05:59.738
There are only a handful
of doctors on duty.

01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:01.849
I'm down to about a quarter
of the hospital staff.

01:06:01.949 --> 01:06:03.810
You've gotta get the uninjured in the
shelters in the campus building.

01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:05.869
Right, I'll see what I can do.

01:06:09.008 --> 01:06:10.011
- Is it over?
- I don't know.

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:11.526
- It seems to be.
- How many were there?

01:06:11.626 --> 01:06:13.486
Two, Kansas City.
There are more to the south.

01:06:13.586 --> 01:06:15.590
Was it just Kansas or the whole country?
I don't know.

01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:17.899
My husband's in Sedalia.
What about Sedalia?

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:20.034
When are you due?
I'm overdue.

01:06:20.134 --> 01:06:21.578
We're going to do
everything we can

01:06:21.678 --> 01:06:23.238
to protect ourselves from the fallout.

01:06:23.638 --> 01:06:24.638
What for?

01:06:24.764 --> 01:06:26.615
Can I have your attention,
please.

01:06:26.724 --> 01:06:30.435
This is... this is only a campus hospital.
We don't have many supplies.

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:32.463
Unless you're seriously injured,

01:06:32.563 --> 01:06:34.424
could you please go to one of
the other campus buildings?

01:06:34.524 --> 01:06:38.318
We have to clear the area
for those who have a serious...

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.359
Ok, burn cases over here.

01:08:06.741 --> 01:08:09.701
Please, listen to me.
Listen to me!

01:08:10.995 --> 01:08:12.370
We need your help.

01:08:12.955 --> 01:08:14.706
This is a hospital.

01:08:14.916 --> 01:08:17.626
Those of you not
seriously ill or injured

01:08:18.252 --> 01:08:22.046
have to work.
Work with our staff.

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:24.466
Now, this work will be dangerous.

01:08:25.635 --> 01:08:26.968
We have to do it

01:08:27.511 --> 01:08:29.455
in order to survive.

01:08:29.555 --> 01:08:33.058
We tried hooking up an auxiliary
pump to a backup generator,

01:08:33.434 --> 01:08:35.018
and we're still only getting a trickle.

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:37.479
I still don't understand.
Did they burn out?

01:08:38.272 --> 01:08:40.357
They could have been subjected
to the E.M.P. Effects.

01:08:42.527 --> 01:08:43.527
What's that?

01:08:43.653 --> 01:08:45.612
Electro-magnetic pulse.

01:08:47.198 --> 01:08:50.075
When a large nuclear device is
air burst at a high altitude,

01:08:51.452 --> 01:08:53.411
a lot of electrical disruption
can be created,

01:08:53.787 --> 01:08:56.997
principally with radios,
communication systems,

01:08:57.792 --> 01:09:00.377
electrical wires, computers,

01:09:01.295 --> 01:09:04.631
cars, transistors. Of course,
it's all theoretical.

01:09:05.383 --> 01:09:06.550
It's never happened before.

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:10.929
In short,
very little electricity.

01:09:12.974 --> 01:09:13.974
Forever?

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:18.645
We'll have to find the nearest hand
pump and chain-gang the water in.

01:09:19.104 --> 01:09:21.048
Nobody's gonna go out there
and expose themselves...

01:09:21.148 --> 01:09:23.091
We have to have water.
How are we gonna operate?

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:25.734
Wait a minute. Sit tight
for a couple of minutes.

01:09:26.444 --> 01:09:27.612
Now...

01:09:29.115 --> 01:09:31.825
What about fuel
to boil water, heat food,

01:09:31.993 --> 01:09:33.743
sterilize surgical instruments?

01:09:33.953 --> 01:09:35.328
What about bringing in wood?

01:09:35.746 --> 01:09:37.648
You can't burn wood
that's been contaminated.

01:09:37.747 --> 01:09:39.541
Just put radiation
right back in the air.

01:09:40.167 --> 01:09:41.334
What about bottled gas?

01:09:41.586 --> 01:09:43.837
There's some butane. But no
more than about 3 days' worth

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:02.423
it's Bruce!

01:10:02.523 --> 01:10:03.216
Hush.

01:10:03.316 --> 01:10:04.608
What's going on?
Be quiet.

01:10:13.993 --> 01:10:15.660
What are you
going to do with that?

01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:25.462
Jim, that's no dog up
there, it's a person.

01:10:34.513 --> 01:10:35.414
Get the hell out of here!

01:10:35.514 --> 01:10:36.874
Whoa! Please don't shoot.

01:10:36.974 --> 01:10:38.266
Jim, stop it.
Get back, Eve.

01:10:38.392 --> 01:10:40.352
I was only looking
for some water.

01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:42.729
Have you got another cellar
out in the barn?

01:10:43.522 --> 01:10:44.731
Look, I'll die out here.

01:10:45.524 --> 01:10:46.467
Let him stay, Jim.

01:10:46.567 --> 01:10:47.567
Sure,

01:10:47.735 --> 01:10:49.986
tonight there'll be 20 people
poundin' on the door.

01:10:50.613 --> 01:10:52.572
No, there won't.
They're all dead.

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:55.075
I'm the last one.

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:57.702
Look, I'll help you
any way you want.

01:10:59.330 --> 01:11:02.666
I won't be any trouble.
I even brought my own food.

01:11:08.589 --> 01:11:10.548
Well, get on down here.
Shut that door first.

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:24.646
Jolene, cut that light off.
Save it for when we need it.

01:11:25.272 --> 01:11:27.065
Just wanted to see who it was.

01:11:27.233 --> 01:11:28.358
All right.

01:11:32.613 --> 01:11:33.780
My name's Stephen.

01:11:34.573 --> 01:11:36.282
We're the Dahlbergs.

01:11:37.118 --> 01:11:38.660
I'm Eve. That's Jim,

01:11:39.078 --> 01:11:41.496
Denise, Jolene, and Danny.

01:11:58.347 --> 01:12:00.056
He looked at one going off.

01:12:02.101 --> 01:12:04.060
Flash blinded.

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:07.131
He burned his retinas.

01:12:07.231 --> 01:12:09.190
What do you know about it?

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.860
Not a whole lot.

01:12:12.737 --> 01:12:14.154
I'm a pre-med over at K.U.

01:12:15.322 --> 01:12:18.283
Do you know Bruce Gallatin?
He... he's a senior.

01:12:18.492 --> 01:12:19.534
No.

01:12:19.827 --> 01:12:21.312
But... but you're from Lawrence,

01:12:21.412 --> 01:12:22.829
so maybe Bruce is all right.

01:12:23.831 --> 01:12:24.831
Well,

01:12:27.501 --> 01:12:29.461
I don't know
what happened to Lawrence.

01:12:32.089 --> 01:12:34.007
I was close to Harrisonville
when it started.

01:12:35.968 --> 01:12:40.430
Must have been
5 or 6 of them to the north,

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:45.977
and a whole string
of 'em to the south.

01:12:48.064 --> 01:12:51.566
They must have hit every missile silo
from Sedalia to El Dorado Springs.

01:12:52.359 --> 01:12:53.526
Hold that.

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:55.570
All right.

01:13:50.417 --> 01:13:52.377
Have you been in shelter
for the past few days?

01:13:53.003 --> 01:13:56.172
Last night we slept in a
chicken Coop in lone Jack.

01:13:58.884 --> 01:14:00.844
But otherwise, you've
been outside since then?

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:09.227
Hold still.

01:14:10.855 --> 01:14:12.605
No sense making
a martyr of yourself.

01:14:18.487 --> 01:14:20.864
You know what's going to happen
next around here, don't you?

01:14:22.074 --> 01:14:24.033
I've been trying
not to think about it.

01:14:25.077 --> 01:14:27.912
We may be the only hospital
operating within 100 miles.

01:14:29.456 --> 01:14:32.584
Everyone half-alive or dying
will find their way here.

01:14:33.294 --> 01:14:35.253
Too late to become a dentist.

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:43.678
What are you thinking?

01:14:46.724 --> 01:14:48.183
I wonder who was spared.

01:14:50.477 --> 01:14:55.648
I wonder if New York,
Paris, Moscow

01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:59.819
are just like Kansas City now.

01:16:37.042 --> 01:16:40.211
Hello, hello, is anybody there?

01:16:43.048 --> 01:16:44.549
Is anybody there?

01:16:47.886 --> 01:16:49.304
This is Lawrence.

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:53.850
This is Lawrence, Kansas.
Is anybody there?

01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:59.173
This is Joe Huxley. I'm broadcasting
out of the science building

01:16:59.273 --> 01:17:02.108
at the university of Kansas.

01:17:03.068 --> 01:17:04.277
Is anybody there?

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:09.741
I have an atmosphere report
for anybody who's listening.

01:17:11.952 --> 01:17:13.911
Dr. Oakes, do you read?

01:17:16.498 --> 01:17:18.359
Come in, Dr. Oakes.
Do you hear me?

01:17:18.459 --> 01:17:20.418
Yes, Joe.

01:17:21.462 --> 01:17:24.505
We're holding fast
at just a hair under, uh,

01:17:25.466 --> 01:17:27.383
50 rads per hour.

01:17:28.594 --> 01:17:30.553
I thought that it
would have diminished by now.

01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:34.083
I guess that means we're
picking up a lot of fallout

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:39.562
from titan missile bases
in Wichita and wherever else

01:17:40.272 --> 01:17:41.340
out west.

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.399
That's the way the wind blows,

01:17:43.942 --> 01:17:45.902
straight toward St. Louis.

01:17:46.153 --> 01:17:48.013
When will it be safe

01:17:48.113 --> 01:17:49.697
to move people
to other buildings?

01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:53.284
It'll never be safe.

01:17:53.911 --> 01:17:55.870
Come on, Joe.

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:02.001
Wait till it gets down
to under 2 rads an hour.

01:18:03.462 --> 01:18:04.879
If and when.

01:18:05.422 --> 01:18:07.324
You picked up anybody else
on your...

01:18:07.424 --> 01:18:09.050
On your end?

01:18:11.178 --> 01:18:12.303
Not a soul.

01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:16.474
This is Lawrence.

01:18:18.227 --> 01:18:20.186
This is Lawrence, Kansas,
is anybody there?

01:18:21.855 --> 01:18:23.356
Anybody at all?

01:18:27.694 --> 01:18:28.804
That's the first time
you've closed your eyes

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:29.946
in 3 days.

01:18:32.491 --> 01:18:34.325
I do it when you're not looking.

01:18:35.494 --> 01:18:36.619
You look terrible.

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:38.871
You sound just like my wife.

01:18:47.881 --> 01:18:49.173
Here.

01:18:50.634 --> 01:18:52.468
I think you should eat
a piece of this orange.

01:18:53.679 --> 01:18:55.638
This may be the last orange
you'll see for...

01:18:58.058 --> 01:19:00.017
A week and a half.

01:19:05.399 --> 01:19:06.941
When you close your eyes,

01:19:09.069 --> 01:19:10.153
you start remembering.

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:13.281
Remembering what?

01:19:15.993 --> 01:19:17.076
My son...

01:19:21.999 --> 01:19:25.168
Catching a pass. My daughter
staring at a painting.

01:19:28.297 --> 01:19:29.964
I...

01:19:30.215 --> 01:19:32.175
It's an accident, you know,

01:19:33.844 --> 01:19:35.344
my being here.

01:19:35.762 --> 01:19:40.933
If I hadn't come back
to take my hematology class,

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:44.103
I'd be in Kansas City,

01:19:47.399 --> 01:19:48.399
with them.

01:19:51.236 --> 01:19:53.112
I'm sorry.

01:19:55.449 --> 01:19:57.267
Raving.

01:19:57.367 --> 01:19:59.327
No, rave on, please.

01:20:02.039 --> 01:20:03.998
I never imagined you...

01:20:04.541 --> 01:20:06.459
Look at that.

01:20:09.129 --> 01:20:10.989
Impervious.
What?

01:20:11.089 --> 01:20:12.590
To radiation.

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:14.759
You are looking at man's legacy.

01:20:14.968 --> 01:20:18.513
The only guaranteed survivor
of a nuclear war.

01:20:24.478 --> 01:20:26.338
Come on, Danny,
I want you to eat.

01:20:26.438 --> 01:20:27.605
I'm not hungry!

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:31.734
Denise, eat this,
otherwise it'll go bad.

01:20:33.987 --> 01:20:35.196
Jolene.

01:20:41.245 --> 01:20:42.604
The battery went dead.

01:20:42.704 --> 01:20:44.664
We can see that, Jolene.
Where are the matches?

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:53.130
What is it, day or night?

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:56.259
It's day, I think.

01:20:56.718 --> 01:20:57.927
What day?

01:20:58.554 --> 01:21:00.513
Wednesday.

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:03.224
It's Thursday.

01:21:04.184 --> 01:21:05.768
2: 30.

01:21:06.144 --> 01:21:08.062
Wonder if it's sunny out.

01:21:10.941 --> 01:21:12.233
I can't remember.

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:15.152
Can't remember what?

01:21:17.281 --> 01:21:19.031
It's only been 5 days

01:21:19.992 --> 01:21:22.535
and I can't remember
what Bruce looks like.

01:21:24.371 --> 01:21:26.998
Now, we've all been through a
lot, sittin' here in the dark.

01:21:28.625 --> 01:21:30.543
What are we doin'
down here anyway?

01:21:32.004 --> 01:21:33.963
It's all over, isn't it?

01:21:36.341 --> 01:21:39.677
It smells so bad down here,
I can't even breathe.

01:21:39.970 --> 01:21:41.413
Now, listen, Denise,
you get a hold of yourself.

01:21:41.513 --> 01:21:43.165
You know that we can't
go out of here...

01:21:43.265 --> 01:21:45.224
Why did I have to
use that thing?

01:21:45.892 --> 01:21:47.852
We'd be married by now, anyway.

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:51.882
Why didn't I at least
get pregnant?

01:21:51.982 --> 01:21:53.175
Just pipe down, Denise.

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:55.802
Because now I can't
even see his face!

01:21:55.902 --> 01:21:59.822
I can't see anything!
I can't see anything!

01:22:00.741 --> 01:22:02.325
I can't see anything!

01:22:02.701 --> 01:22:04.603
Denise, honey, just calm down.

01:22:04.703 --> 01:22:06.662
Let go of me.
I can't see.

01:22:07.748 --> 01:22:09.707
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:22:10.542 --> 01:22:12.501
I'll get her. I owe you.

01:22:14.504 --> 01:22:15.546
No, Jim.

01:22:29.269 --> 01:22:30.269
See?

01:22:31.229 --> 01:22:33.022
There's nothing wrong out here.

01:22:33.523 --> 01:22:35.050
It's a beautiful day.

01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:36.150
No.

01:22:36.902 --> 01:22:38.152
It only looks that way.

01:22:49.039 --> 01:22:50.039
Hey!

01:22:50.624 --> 01:22:51.624
Hey!

01:22:52.959 --> 01:22:53.959
You can't see it.

01:22:56.213 --> 01:22:57.380
You can't feel it.

01:22:59.508 --> 01:23:01.467
And you can't taste it.

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:04.720
But it's here,

01:23:06.098 --> 01:23:08.641
right now, all around us.

01:23:11.645 --> 01:23:14.730
It's going through you
like an x-ray,

01:23:16.483 --> 01:23:17.858
right into your cells.

01:23:19.444 --> 01:23:21.404
What do you think
killed all these animals?

01:23:27.452 --> 01:23:29.354
Get away!

01:23:29.454 --> 01:23:31.288
Now, come...

01:23:31.415 --> 01:23:33.374
Ah! Get away!

01:24:40.484 --> 01:24:41.692
Where are you going?

01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:43.652
Holden.

01:24:44.237 --> 01:24:46.197
Oh, yeah, how come?

01:24:47.365 --> 01:24:48.365
People there.

01:24:49.326 --> 01:24:50.326
How do you know?

01:24:51.161 --> 01:24:53.120
A man with a C.B.
Back in Leeton.

01:24:53.747 --> 01:24:54.872
You from Leeton?

01:24:55.749 --> 01:24:57.208
How's Sedalia?

01:24:58.752 --> 01:25:00.544
I... I said, how's Sedalia?

01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:03.589
There ain't no Sedalia.

01:25:04.841 --> 01:25:09.011
Ain't no Green Ridge,
no Windsor, no nothin'.

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:27.655
No more room.

01:25:28.448 --> 01:25:30.407
No more room!

01:25:41.002 --> 01:25:44.547
Russell, 17 people
died in here this morning.

01:25:44.798 --> 01:25:46.742
I would say we're running
a serious cholera risk.

01:25:46.842 --> 01:25:49.635
To say nothing of the bodies,
and the morgue is filled.

01:25:50.679 --> 01:25:52.263
Should we start
using the garage?

01:25:52.681 --> 01:25:55.542
Move the terminal radiation
patients back into the ward rooms,

01:25:55.642 --> 01:25:57.726
make them as comfortable
as possible.

01:25:57.853 --> 01:25:59.671
And I'll talk to Joe Huxley
about the rad situation.

01:25:59.771 --> 01:26:02.106
Dr. Oakes, we're running
very low on morphine.

01:26:02.274 --> 01:26:03.383
There's been quite a lot
of stealing going on.

01:26:03.483 --> 01:26:04.885
They're stealing food
from the kitchen.

01:26:04.985 --> 01:26:08.571
Dr. Strayhorne got his wrist broken
trying to stop a fight down in emergency.

01:26:08.822 --> 01:26:10.155
Close the doors!

01:26:10.407 --> 01:26:13.033
Don't let anyone else in. Put
on extra guards if you have to.

01:26:13.368 --> 01:26:15.812
How can we care for people
if we have no control,

01:26:15.912 --> 01:26:17.830
isn't that what you're trying
to tell me, Julian?

01:26:19.291 --> 01:26:20.332
Yes.

01:26:32.429 --> 01:26:35.639
Doctor, have you heard
about firing squads?

01:26:36.141 --> 01:26:37.892
Anything about firing squads?

01:26:41.021 --> 01:26:42.104
What are you talking about?

01:26:42.272 --> 01:26:43.564
They're shooting people.

01:26:44.190 --> 01:26:46.635
Shooting? What for?

01:26:46.735 --> 01:26:49.612
Looting, hijacking,
rape, murder.

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:51.322
Without a trial?

01:26:53.325 --> 01:26:55.284
That's nonsense.
That's crazy!

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:57.369
Go back to work!

01:27:18.725 --> 01:27:19.725
Hey.

01:27:28.068 --> 01:27:29.193
What the hell are you doin'?

01:27:34.074 --> 01:27:36.033
Hey. Hey, whoa.
Hey, wait a minute.

01:27:36.368 --> 01:27:38.327
No, no, come on,
don't do that, man.

01:27:38.912 --> 01:27:39.912
Cool it.

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:44.583
Hey, no, no. D-don't do that.
Come on, man.

01:27:47.379 --> 01:27:48.363
Who's that?

01:27:48.463 --> 01:27:49.463
Go on.

01:27:52.759 --> 01:27:53.884
Wait, wait.

01:27:58.098 --> 01:28:01.433
It's ok, man.
Just relax. It's all right.

01:28:02.936 --> 01:28:04.812
Hey.

01:28:05.981 --> 01:28:07.147
Want some...

01:28:14.906 --> 01:28:16.240
Did you see these people?

01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:18.659
That's us, man,
if we don't get to Lawrence.

01:28:19.869 --> 01:28:20.854
You hear me?

01:28:20.954 --> 01:28:22.856
Hey, that's legal tender,
by the way.

01:28:22.956 --> 01:28:24.957
They got a hospital in Lawrence.

01:28:27.043 --> 01:28:28.544
You're not a big talker,
are you?

01:28:30.296 --> 01:28:33.215
Did Dr. Montoya discuss
caesarian section with you?

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:35.926
I'm wide enough.
There's nothin' in the way.

01:28:37.262 --> 01:28:39.179
I'm just waitin' around here
like everybody else.

01:28:40.223 --> 01:28:41.390
Who knows what for?

01:28:43.393 --> 01:28:45.352
Maybe that's why
you're 2 weeks overdue.

01:28:46.813 --> 01:28:49.732
If you were in utero and you had
any choice about the matter,

01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:53.110
would you be dying to be born
into a world like this?

01:28:57.407 --> 01:29:01.076
You think your baby's deciding
whether or not to be born?

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.997
You think I'm holding back
by force of will, Dr. Oakes?

01:29:05.999 --> 01:29:06.900
Bad toilet training?

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.626
No, I think
you've got to be willing

01:29:10.670 --> 01:29:13.422
to let your baby come
whether you like it or not.

01:29:14.632 --> 01:29:16.493
You're holding back hope.

01:29:16.593 --> 01:29:18.177
Hope for what?

01:29:19.888 --> 01:29:21.847
What do you think
is gonna happen out there?

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:25.669
You think we're gonna sweep up the
dead and fill in a couple of holes

01:29:25.769 --> 01:29:27.728
and build some supermarkets?

01:29:29.439 --> 01:29:31.341
You think all those people left
alive out there are gonna say:

01:29:31.441 --> 01:29:35.402
"Oh, I'm sorry. It wasn't my fault.
Let's kiss and make up"?

01:29:36.863 --> 01:29:38.197
We knew the score.

01:29:38.782 --> 01:29:40.991
We knew all about bombs,
we knew all about fallout.

01:29:41.659 --> 01:29:43.368
We knew this could happen
for 40 years.

01:29:45.205 --> 01:29:46.430
But nobody was interested.

01:29:50.543 --> 01:29:52.686
- I can't argue with you.
- Argue with me.

01:29:54.297 --> 01:29:55.506
Please.

01:29:56.174 --> 01:29:58.092
Give me a reason.
Tell me about hope.

01:30:00.178 --> 01:30:01.637
Tell me why you work
so hard in here.

01:30:04.057 --> 01:30:05.057
I don't know.

01:32:35.458 --> 01:32:37.084
Corn will be a total loss.

01:32:42.048 --> 01:32:43.632
Should've harvested 10 days ago.

01:32:44.133 --> 01:32:46.051
Cows can't graze.

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:49.930
Contaminate the milk,
as well as themselves.

01:32:50.473 --> 01:32:52.182
We're lucky to be alive.

01:32:54.018 --> 01:32:55.811
We'll see how lucky that is.

01:33:19.609 --> 01:33:20.609
Name?

01:33:20.712 --> 01:33:21.893
McCoy, William.

01:33:21.994 --> 01:33:23.740
- Airman first class.
- Home?

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:26.454
Whiteman air force base,
Sedalia, Missouri.

01:33:26.755 --> 01:33:28.802
- This is my friend...
- One at a time.

01:33:29.262 --> 01:33:30.470
He can't talk.

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:31.638
What's your injury?

01:33:31.806 --> 01:33:33.765
I, uh, I can't keep nothin' in.

01:33:36.311 --> 01:33:37.536
Not even my own hair.

01:33:43.026 --> 01:33:46.862
I got... I got... I got these bruises,
like, all... all over my arm, see?

01:33:47.572 --> 01:33:48.613
And it's real bad.

01:33:49.907 --> 01:33:52.743
Look, look. See... see, look.
See, look. Look at Cody.

01:33:52.952 --> 01:33:54.703
See, Cody's got them
all up his arm, like...

01:33:57.290 --> 01:33:59.359
Look, I know we got
radiation sickness.

01:33:59.459 --> 01:34:01.960
The only question is, is there
anything that we can do about it?

01:34:05.631 --> 01:34:09.885
The radiation count is now
0.4 rads an hour.

01:34:10.178 --> 01:34:13.764
This is considered safe
for limited exposure outdoors.

01:34:14.057 --> 01:34:18.518
We urge all of you not suffering
from specific physical injury

01:34:18.644 --> 01:34:21.229
to seek fresh shelter
in campus buildings.

01:35:48.526 --> 01:35:50.110
There was a great earthquake,

01:35:50.862 --> 01:35:52.362
and the, uh,

01:35:53.322 --> 01:35:55.615
the sun became black
as sackcloth,

01:35:57.994 --> 01:35:58.994
and a third

01:36:00.413 --> 01:36:02.122
of the earth was burnt up.

01:36:02.915 --> 01:36:05.834
A third of the trees
and all the green grass.

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:10.213
And then from the smoke came locusts on
the earth with the power of scorpions.

01:36:10.673 --> 01:36:11.840
And they were told...

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:17.888
Th-they...
They were told not to harm

01:36:18.764 --> 01:36:21.850
the grass of the earth
or any green tree,

01:36:23.519 --> 01:36:27.230
but only those who have not the
seal of god upon their foreheads.

01:36:31.110 --> 01:36:32.694
Are we here today

01:36:33.863 --> 01:36:35.864
counted among god's servants?

01:36:43.456 --> 01:36:44.956
We give thanks to thee,

01:36:46.417 --> 01:36:49.377
oh, lord god almighty,
for rewarding thy servants,

01:36:51.714 --> 01:36:54.508
and those who fear thy name,
both great and small,

01:36:58.846 --> 01:37:01.723
and for destroying
the destroyers of the earth.

01:37:17.365 --> 01:37:18.949
Pettis county's closed down.

01:37:19.492 --> 01:37:21.602
Well, there's...
there's a university hospital in Lawrence.

01:37:21.702 --> 01:37:23.345
I don't know. It's awful far.

01:37:23.746 --> 01:37:25.263
Well, it's her only chance.

01:37:25.648 --> 01:37:26.748
And Danny's, too.

01:37:28.002 --> 01:37:29.026
Look, you stay here...

01:37:29.126 --> 01:37:30.168
She's my daughter.

01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:31.962
I'm gonna bring 'em back.

01:37:41.998 --> 01:37:43.198
What's goin' on?

01:37:57.947 --> 01:38:01.007
Eve, we're gonna have to try
to get her up here a little more secure.

01:38:02.493 --> 01:38:05.004
I'm gonna try to put her feet through here.

01:38:05.204 --> 01:38:07.308
Maybe you could help me with her head.

01:38:07.435 --> 01:38:08.438
Yeah, let me... let me get out.

01:38:08.541 --> 01:38:10.234
Move over for your sister,
would you, please?

01:38:10.334 --> 01:38:12.252
Just lie right down there,
sweetheart.

01:38:26.225 --> 01:38:27.726
Denise, can you hear me?

01:38:27.852 --> 01:38:28.852
It's your daddy.

01:38:30.771 --> 01:38:31.938
Daddy.

01:38:32.648 --> 01:38:33.815
Daddy loves you.

01:39:02.954 --> 01:39:04.506
- What do you see?
- Oh,

01:39:05.007 --> 01:39:06.057
cows,

01:39:06.932 --> 01:39:08.558
telephone poles.

01:39:10.770 --> 01:39:11.811
Usual stuff.

01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:38.213
Have you seen
what's going on out there?

01:39:38.422 --> 01:39:39.422
Yes.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.049
Well, what are we going to do?

01:39:41.676 --> 01:39:43.259
Going to let them in, Paul.

01:39:43.844 --> 01:39:45.428
As many as you can.

01:39:52.687 --> 01:39:56.064
The president
of the United States.

01:39:56.732 --> 01:39:58.175
My fellow Americans,

01:39:58.275 --> 01:40:01.569
while the extent of damage to
our country is still uncertain,

01:40:02.196 --> 01:40:04.489
and shall probably remain so
for some time,

01:40:05.616 --> 01:40:09.494
preliminary reports indicate that
principal weapons impact points

01:40:09.829 --> 01:40:12.288
included military
and industrial targets

01:40:12.873 --> 01:40:15.041
in most sectors of the United States.

01:40:16.085 --> 01:40:18.169
There is, at the present time,

01:40:18.587 --> 01:40:20.630
a ceasefire
with the Soviet Union

01:40:21.173 --> 01:40:23.925
which has sustained damage
equally catastrophic.

01:40:25.094 --> 01:40:27.846
Many of you
listening to me today

01:40:28.472 --> 01:40:32.142
have suffered personal injury,
sudden separation from loved ones,

01:40:32.893 --> 01:40:35.004
and the tragic loss
of your families.

01:40:35.104 --> 01:40:36.938
I share your grief,

01:40:37.481 --> 01:40:39.983
for I, too,
have suffered personal loss.

01:40:41.152 --> 01:40:43.027
During this hour of sorrow,

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:47.266
I wish to assure you
that America has survived

01:40:47.366 --> 01:40:48.700
this terrible tribulation.

01:40:48.826 --> 01:40:51.202
There has been no surrender,

01:40:51.662 --> 01:40:55.165
no retreat from the principles
of Liberty and democracy

01:40:55.291 --> 01:40:58.460
for which the free world
looks to us for leadership.

01:41:00.296 --> 01:41:02.088
We remain undaunted

01:41:02.506 --> 01:41:04.632
before all but almighty God.

01:41:06.469 --> 01:41:11.306
The government functioning under certain
extraordinary emergency options,

01:41:11.599 --> 01:41:14.017
we are prepared to make
every effort

01:41:14.226 --> 01:41:19.522
to coordinate relief and recovery
programs at the state and local levels.

01:41:21.233 --> 01:41:22.317
During the next 2 weeks,

01:41:22.943 --> 01:41:25.763
my staff and cabinet
will attempt to relocate

01:41:25.863 --> 01:41:28.615
to national emergency
reconstruction headquarters.

01:41:28.866 --> 01:41:30.074
At the present time,

01:41:30.534 --> 01:41:33.870
and until radiation pattern
reports are made available

01:41:33.996 --> 01:41:36.289
over the
emergency broadcast band,

01:41:36.415 --> 01:41:38.082
or through
your local authorities,

01:41:38.667 --> 01:41:41.028
I urge you to remain

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:44.005
in areas offering maximum
shelter protection

01:41:44.173 --> 01:41:45.840
from radioactive fallout,

01:41:46.175 --> 01:41:49.052
and to obey all local curfews.

01:41:49.845 --> 01:41:52.722
We are counting on you,
on your strength,

01:41:53.224 --> 01:41:54.349
your patience,

01:41:54.767 --> 01:41:57.060
your will, and your courage

01:41:57.436 --> 01:42:00.355
to help rebuild
this great nation of ours.

01:42:00.689 --> 01:42:02.273
God bless you all.

01:42:03.776 --> 01:42:06.069
That's it?
That's all he's gonna say?

01:42:06.445 --> 01:42:07.862
Hey, maybe we're gonna be ok.

01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:09.072
What do you wanna hear?

01:42:09.323 --> 01:42:12.450
I want to know who started it,
who fired first, who pre-empted.

01:42:12.618 --> 01:42:13.769
You're never gonna know that.

01:42:13.869 --> 01:42:15.203
What difference does it make?

01:42:15.371 --> 01:42:16.689
He doesn't know how bad...

01:42:16.789 --> 01:42:18.790
He sure would have told us
if they fired first.

01:42:19.208 --> 01:42:20.776
He doesn't want anyone
to think we lost the war.

01:42:20.876 --> 01:42:23.753
You believe that? You believe
everything they tell you?

01:42:24.088 --> 01:42:25.088
Doctor?

01:42:25.714 --> 01:42:28.508
You know what Einstein said
about world war III?

01:42:30.719 --> 01:42:33.471
He said he didn't know how they
were gonna fight world war III,

01:42:35.307 --> 01:42:37.475
but he knew how they would
fight world war lv.

01:42:39.395 --> 01:42:41.062
With sticks and stones.

01:42:41.647 --> 01:42:44.148
Can I get some help
here, please?

01:42:47.528 --> 01:42:50.238
Dr. Oakes, we have to contend
with the number of bodies,

01:42:50.656 --> 01:42:53.032
the time required for
each individual burial...

01:42:56.704 --> 01:42:57.704
Dr. Oakes?

01:42:57.955 --> 01:43:00.665
The danger of infection now
is so grave, the only solution

01:43:00.791 --> 01:43:03.418
is to prepare public graves
on the outside of town.

01:43:04.837 --> 01:43:05.837
Dr. Oakes!

01:43:06.088 --> 01:43:06.822
Dr. Oakes!

01:43:06.922 --> 01:43:09.090
You're wanted in surgery.
You're already 5 minutes late.

01:43:10.634 --> 01:43:11.634
Dr. Oakes!

01:43:12.553 --> 01:43:15.013
Dr. Oakes,
are you all right?

01:43:23.272 --> 01:43:24.381
You got a boy out there?

01:43:24.481 --> 01:43:25.982
Number 80. Alan Oakes.

01:43:29.111 --> 01:43:31.404
I swear that we made Marilyn
that night.

01:43:32.323 --> 01:43:34.741
We're all changing, daddy,
don't you see?

01:43:35.826 --> 01:43:38.870
Stupidity has a habit of getting its way.

01:43:40.623 --> 01:43:41.831
Hey.

01:43:42.708 --> 01:43:44.375
I'm moving to Boston.

01:43:45.252 --> 01:43:46.461
What if it does happen?

01:43:47.171 --> 01:43:48.113
What do we do?

01:43:48.213 --> 01:43:50.381
Hiroshima was peanuts.

01:43:51.717 --> 01:43:56.262
All the way!

01:43:57.765 --> 01:44:00.141
Because the artist wants you
to be in the landscape,

01:44:00.643 --> 01:44:01.502
a part of it.

01:44:01.602 --> 01:44:04.062
Like the sun exploding.

01:44:05.439 --> 01:44:07.649
People are crazy,
but not that crazy.

01:44:24.041 --> 01:44:25.500
I'd like some water, please.

01:44:28.003 --> 01:44:29.170
Helen?

01:44:33.467 --> 01:44:34.717
You're not Helen.

01:44:43.811 --> 01:44:45.770
This must be the hospice.

01:44:46.188 --> 01:44:47.772
I'm cold!

01:44:52.861 --> 01:44:54.570
Probably thinks I'm dying.

01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:59.158
Maybe I am.

01:45:01.328 --> 01:45:02.745
Maybe we're all dying.

01:45:04.081 --> 01:45:06.374
Nurse! N-nurse!

01:45:06.959 --> 01:45:08.418
I... I can't find my shirt!

01:45:08.961 --> 01:45:10.863
I can't find my shirt.
I can't find my...

01:45:10.963 --> 01:45:12.547
I looked. I looked.

01:45:12.673 --> 01:45:13.965
I've got your shirt, right here.

01:45:14.174 --> 01:45:16.342
No, no, I... I can't find
my shirt! I...

01:45:17.302 --> 01:45:18.386
It's ok.

01:45:20.139 --> 01:45:21.723
Ok, ok, ok.

01:45:23.934 --> 01:45:25.018
Yes, sir.

01:45:25.853 --> 01:45:26.894
Ok, ok, ok.

01:45:27.271 --> 01:45:31.607
Ok, ok.

01:45:46.498 --> 01:45:48.207
Yo, hey,

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:49.709
give me a hand?

01:45:50.961 --> 01:45:52.879
We're running out of body bags.

01:45:53.255 --> 01:45:56.049
Can we use
trash-can liners instead?

01:46:10.564 --> 01:46:13.357
Hurry up, it's been days!
We're hungry.

01:46:28.290 --> 01:46:29.957
That's it, no more.

01:46:31.043 --> 01:46:32.460
What do you mean, no more?

01:46:32.878 --> 01:46:34.655
I've got 3 chits
for powdered milk

01:46:34.755 --> 01:46:37.658
and 2 kids who haven't eaten
since day before yesterday.

01:46:37.758 --> 01:46:39.576
I'm sorry, lady.
What do you want me to do?

01:46:39.676 --> 01:46:41.870
You wanna come in and look around
at the stuff we're hiding?

01:46:41.970 --> 01:46:44.206
Yeah, you've got
more food in there.

01:46:44.306 --> 01:46:45.348
That's for the other camp.

01:46:51.605 --> 01:46:59.362
Food! Food! Food!

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.251
Are you really a doctor?

01:47:13.585 --> 01:47:15.002
You sure don't talk like one.

01:47:15.671 --> 01:47:18.506
Well, I'm... actually,
I'm the pizza man.

01:47:22.970 --> 01:47:23.970
What's your name?

01:47:24.429 --> 01:47:25.429
Sam.

01:47:26.682 --> 01:47:28.266
Sam Hachiya.

01:47:29.351 --> 01:47:30.601
What kind of name is that?

01:47:30.978 --> 01:47:32.270
What's it sound like?

01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:35.148
I don't know. Italian?

01:47:35.357 --> 01:47:36.357
There you go.

01:47:36.692 --> 01:47:40.403
Hey, what do you know?
Sam Hachiya pizzeria, eh?

01:47:44.116 --> 01:47:45.741
When can I see my sister?

01:47:49.872 --> 01:47:51.205
Um, that depends, kiddo.

01:47:52.875 --> 01:47:54.792
You stay here.
I'll be back.

01:47:56.753 --> 01:47:57.879
I'm not goin' any place.

01:48:05.053 --> 01:48:07.346
So what we want you to do now,

01:48:07.723 --> 01:48:09.557
burn out your current crops,

01:48:10.475 --> 01:48:12.393
start decontaminating the soil,

01:48:13.562 --> 01:48:14.937
and plan next spring's planting.

01:48:16.064 --> 01:48:18.024
Crop selection
must consider plants

01:48:18.275 --> 01:48:20.902
least susceptible to
ultraviolet radiation,

01:48:22.029 --> 01:48:24.864
and yields for human rather
than animal consumption.

01:48:25.365 --> 01:48:26.517
Excuse me, Mel,

01:48:26.617 --> 01:48:30.161
but how do you go about
decontaminatin' the soil?

01:48:31.038 --> 01:48:33.164
Well, you chiefly wait

01:48:33.290 --> 01:48:37.084
for the fallout to decay to
safe enough levels to either

01:48:37.336 --> 01:48:39.629
plow under or
scrape off the top layers.

01:48:40.047 --> 01:48:41.964
How do you know what safe is?

01:48:45.135 --> 01:48:47.162
Uh, we'll have a, uh,

01:48:47.262 --> 01:48:52.225
N.E.R.A. Task force advising each
county agricultural cooperative.

01:48:52.392 --> 01:48:53.476
Task force?

01:48:53.685 --> 01:48:55.504
Where the hell's he think
they're coming from?

01:48:55.604 --> 01:48:59.148
We're just going to have to channel
animal feed to human needs.

01:48:59.816 --> 01:49:00.983
Except for, uh,

01:49:01.735 --> 01:49:04.346
except for dairy cows that pass
muster, and certain poultry.

01:49:04.446 --> 01:49:05.571
What is he talking about?

01:49:05.739 --> 01:49:09.158
Can you explain what you mean by scraping
off the top layers of my topsoil?

01:49:09.409 --> 01:49:14.580
Uh, exactly that, Jim. You just take
the top 4 or 5 inches of your topsoil.

01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:16.374
Yeah, and do what with it?

01:49:17.542 --> 01:49:20.586
We're talking 150,
maybe 200 acres a man in here.

01:49:20.712 --> 01:49:21.697
That's right.

01:49:21.797 --> 01:49:24.257
Bein' big is one thing.
Bein' realistic is another.

01:49:24.466 --> 01:49:27.468
Suppose you find a hole where you
can drop all this dead dirt,

01:49:27.719 --> 01:49:30.346
what kind of topsoil is that gonna
leave you for raisin' anything?

01:49:31.598 --> 01:49:33.292
Where'd you get
all this information, John?

01:49:33.392 --> 01:49:36.018
All this good advice? Out of
some government pamphlet?

01:49:36.186 --> 01:49:38.938
Damn, somebody's
gotta take charge.

01:49:39.856 --> 01:49:43.276
Fellas, we're talking catastrophe
here, not life as usual.

01:49:43.652 --> 01:49:47.139
Now the national emergency
reconstruction administration's

01:49:47.239 --> 01:49:49.699
primary goal
is to establish order,

01:49:50.117 --> 01:49:53.786
and to aid you in salvaging your
resources for the country at large.

01:50:10.721 --> 01:50:12.305
What's goin' on down there?

01:50:14.391 --> 01:50:16.309
What do you think
you're doin' down there?

01:50:41.126 --> 01:50:42.668
Who are you folks?

01:51:02.522 --> 01:51:03.647
This is my home.

01:51:27.964 --> 01:51:29.632
Where's nurse Bauer?

01:51:55.867 --> 01:51:56.951
Tell me. Sam.

01:51:59.621 --> 01:52:00.621
What was it?

01:52:03.583 --> 01:52:04.583
Meningitis.

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:12.925
Doc.

01:52:30.819 --> 01:52:31.819
You know.

01:52:32.529 --> 01:52:35.281
You shouldn't go back to work right away.

01:52:35.866 --> 01:52:36.949
Doctor's orders?

01:52:39.077 --> 01:52:40.077
Right.

01:52:42.914 --> 01:52:43.914
All right.

01:52:44.416 --> 01:52:46.000
I'll take some time off.

01:52:46.626 --> 01:52:47.626
See the sights.

01:52:50.922 --> 01:52:53.048
Take yourself a little vacation.

01:52:53.216 --> 01:52:55.092
Nice time of the year, Fall.

01:52:57.721 --> 01:52:58.846
Where you thinking of going?

01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:01.140
Kansas City.

01:53:09.983 --> 01:53:10.983
Aren't you curious?

01:53:12.861 --> 01:53:14.612
Don't you wonder about it?

01:53:19.659 --> 01:53:21.327
I'm not going back there.

01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:26.624
Why don't you come with me.

01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:35.257
They probably won't let you
back in anyway.

01:53:42.474 --> 01:53:44.808
I want to see my home
before I die.

01:54:11.294 --> 01:54:12.294
Ready.

01:54:12.587 --> 01:54:13.587
Fire.

01:54:19.344 --> 01:54:20.553
- No!
- Ok!

01:54:21.263 --> 01:54:22.263
All right, all right.

01:54:23.014 --> 01:54:25.099
I'll get the bandages back on,
take your hands down.

01:54:31.856 --> 01:54:32.856
There they go.

01:54:34.150 --> 01:54:35.150
Ok.

01:54:38.196 --> 01:54:39.196
Ok.

01:54:52.877 --> 01:54:54.795
This isn't gonna work, is it?

01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:59.008
It hasn't been that long, Danny.

01:54:59.217 --> 01:55:01.385
The nerves might still grow back.

01:55:01.678 --> 01:55:03.137
Your voice is shaking.

01:55:07.934 --> 01:55:09.461
I'd like to go home now.

01:55:09.561 --> 01:55:11.353
I want to be with my Mom and Dad.

01:55:18.028 --> 01:55:19.028
Danny?

01:55:20.572 --> 01:55:21.572
I'll take you.

01:55:23.033 --> 01:55:24.033
Steven?

01:55:25.285 --> 01:55:26.493
What about Denise?

01:55:30.707 --> 01:55:32.124
We're all going home.

01:55:32.542 --> 01:55:33.542
Ok?

01:55:34.294 --> 01:55:35.294
Come on.

01:55:40.008 --> 01:55:41.008
Thank you.

01:55:47.265 --> 01:55:49.600
You're not really Italian, are you?

01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:52.144
No.

01:55:54.522 --> 01:55:55.731
So where you from?

01:55:59.861 --> 01:56:00.861
Kansas City.

01:58:09.908 --> 01:58:12.367
You look like you fell off your bike.

01:58:17.665 --> 01:58:20.584
Denise? I had a hard time finding you here.

01:58:21.961 --> 01:58:23.161
How's Danny?

01:58:24.214 --> 01:58:25.198
He's ok.

01:58:25.298 --> 01:58:26.632
What about his eyes?

01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:29.101
Uh, Doctor says,

01:58:29.552 --> 01:58:32.004
that I'll be able to take you home
in a couple of days.

01:58:34.724 --> 01:58:35.724
Phones working?

01:58:36.434 --> 01:58:39.269
Are you kidding?
There aren't going to be any phones.

01:58:39.979 --> 01:58:40.979
They,

01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:48.028
they gave me this ribbon to wear.

01:58:54.702 --> 01:58:57.788
But I haven't got any damn hair
to put it into.

01:59:16.683 --> 01:59:17.683
You look great.

02:02:27.999 --> 02:02:28.999
Helen.

02:02:42.430 --> 02:02:44.014
Get out of my house.

02:03:05.536 --> 02:03:06.787
Didn't you hear me?

02:03:09.123 --> 02:03:13.251
I told you to get out of my house.

02:04:49.432 --> 02:04:50.432
Hello?

02:04:50.641 --> 02:04:51.866
Is anybody there?

02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:53.760
Anybody at all?

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.500
