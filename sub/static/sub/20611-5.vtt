00:02.736 --> 00:05.639
- Here in the Forge,
America's best bladesmiths

00:05.673 --> 00:07.675
have gone head-to-head...
- Whoo!

00:07.708 --> 00:10.511
- Creating some of history's
deadliest weapons.

00:10.544 --> 00:13.447
But this time,
in a "Forged in Fire" first,

00:13.481 --> 00:15.383
we let the fans vote online

00:15.416 --> 00:17.751
to bring back their favorites,
so tonight,

00:17.785 --> 00:20.621
four of the competition's
most memorable craftsmen

00:20.654 --> 00:22.523
return for a second shot
at victory.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.458
- I'm going to tear it up.

00:24.492 --> 00:26.227
- Which fan favorite
will take home $10,000

00:26.260 --> 00:27.261
and be declared...

00:27.295 --> 00:28.529
- Whoo!

00:28.562 --> 00:31.165
- "Forged in Fire" champion?

00:31.199 --> 00:34.135
[dramatic music]

00:34.168 --> 00:41.609
*

00:41.642 --> 00:43.111
- My name is Robby Bowman.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.712
A lot of people refer to me

00:44.745 --> 00:46.114
as the blacksmithing cowboy

00:46.147 --> 00:48.116
of the Great Smoky Mountains.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.784
This time, it's the fans
that voted me on.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.687
They know I'm better
than what I performed last time,

00:53.721 --> 00:55.256
and I'm here to win it
this time.

00:55.289 --> 00:56.257
Whoo!

00:56.290 --> 00:57.491
[chuckles]

00:57.525 --> 00:59.227
- My name's Chad Osborne.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.494
The fans have spoken.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.230
That's why I'm back here.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.232
Hopefully because
I'm a nice guy.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.400
I made it all the way
to the finals last time.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.468
I didn't win.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.203
This time, I'm gonna make

01:09.237 --> 01:10.504
a forge-a-licious blade

01:10.538 --> 01:13.374
that will be worthy of the show.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.344
- I'm Josh Weston.
The last time I was here...

01:16.377 --> 01:18.412
I don't want
to talk about this.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.614
I will. I will.
I'm just kidding.

01:20.648 --> 01:24.318
I didn't handle the problems
that I ran into well at all,

01:24.352 --> 01:26.120
and we all got to watch that

01:26.154 --> 01:31.459
by watching my hair
go from this to that.

01:31.492 --> 01:35.129
Maybe it's the hair,
is why I'm a fan favorite.

01:35.163 --> 01:38.766
- My name is Ray Kirk.
I'm 72 years old.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.702
It is an exceedingly
humble experience

01:41.735 --> 01:44.605
that people wanted
to see me back on here.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.907
When I was here last time,
I enjoyed it,

01:46.940 --> 01:49.277
and I think I could
win this one.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.744
I think.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.213
*

01:52.246 --> 01:53.547
- Welcome back to the Forge.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.649
It's good to see you guys again.

01:55.683 --> 01:57.518
You're here because fans decided

01:57.551 --> 01:59.353
that you deserved
a second shot at the title,

01:59.387 --> 02:01.489
so don't squander it.

02:01.522 --> 02:04.225
As before, every aspect of your
bladesmithing capabilities

02:04.258 --> 02:05.859
will be put to the test
under the scrutiny

02:05.893 --> 02:07.861
of our panel of expert judges:

02:07.895 --> 02:10.631
world-famous bladesmith
Jason Knight,

02:10.664 --> 02:12.266
historic weapons
recreation specialist

02:12.300 --> 02:13.734
David Baker,

02:13.767 --> 02:15.869
Kali martial artist
Doug Marcaida.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.871
*

02:17.905 --> 02:19.473
In this round of competition,

02:19.507 --> 02:21.509
you'll have to forge
signature blades

02:21.542 --> 02:24.178
using a piece of 1084 steel.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.180
The blade parameters
are as follows:

02:26.214 --> 02:28.382
the length of your blade,
not including the tang,

02:28.416 --> 02:30.651
must be between
8 and 10 inches.

02:30.684 --> 02:31.885
The overall length
of your weapon

02:31.919 --> 02:34.655
cannot exceed 22 inches.

02:34.688 --> 02:38.526
Additionally, your blade also
must be made out of...

02:38.559 --> 02:40.428
*

02:40.461 --> 02:42.263
Barbed wire.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.431
- Are you forging kidding me?

02:43.464 --> 02:45.266
Barbed wire?

02:45.299 --> 02:49.270
It's for farm fences,
not for blades.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.239
- Your finished blades
will be tested for strength

02:51.272 --> 02:52.773
and durability
in a barbed-wire chop

02:52.806 --> 02:54.642
and for edge retention,

02:54.675 --> 02:58.279
slicing through
a Kevlar-reinforced sandbag.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.847
You'll have ten minutes
to work on your designs.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.883
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.652
Good luck, bladesmiths.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.954
Your ten-minute
design window starts now.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.657
*

03:09.690 --> 03:10.924
- The first hurdle
they're gonna have

03:10.958 --> 03:13.227
is forge welding
the barbed wire.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.796
It's important as to where
they put this piece of steel,

03:15.829 --> 03:19.967
'cause the barbed wire is not
a hardenable piece of steel.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.271
- I'm making sort of like
a camp knife.

03:23.304 --> 03:28.342
I like a design that's easy
to use and easy to modify.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.379
"Forged in Fire"
has changed my life a lot.

03:31.412 --> 03:35.015
I get my picture taken
with a lot of people,

03:35.048 --> 03:36.684
but they don't buy no knives.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.752
*

03:38.786 --> 03:41.722
- I'm making
a chopper-style blade.

03:41.755 --> 03:45.259
It's got a heavier front,
slightly curved forward.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.295
Last time I was here,
my wife, she had cancer,

03:47.328 --> 03:48.896
and I was hoping to win
so I could take her

03:48.929 --> 03:51.399
on a nice Hawaiian cruise.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.601
But she's doing better,
so this time,

03:53.634 --> 03:56.504
I'm doing it for me so I can
prove that I can actually do it.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.506
*

03:58.539 --> 04:00.274
- I'd like to see
some 10-inch blades.

04:00.308 --> 04:02.343
It all depends on
how much barbed wire they use,

04:02.376 --> 04:05.946
but they should have enough
steel to make more than that.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.916
- My design is
a clip-point hunter

04:08.949 --> 04:13.053
that will pierce,
slice, and chop.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.055
In November,
the Great Smoky Mountains

04:15.088 --> 04:17.658
had a devastating fire.

04:17.691 --> 04:20.728
Thousands of families
lost everything they owned,

04:20.761 --> 04:22.696
and I want to help.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.799
You know, I can't afford
to write a $10,000 check.

04:25.833 --> 04:29.337
But I could win one
and give it to somebody.

04:29.370 --> 04:34.542
- My game plan is to do
a Anglo Saxon-style seax.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.910
Brokeback,
it has a really nice point.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.612
This blade will be--

04:38.646 --> 04:39.947
I'm trying not to swear
this time,

04:39.980 --> 04:41.649
by the way.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.051
I have an aunt,
and she said to me,

04:44.084 --> 04:47.020
"Josh, I really like
seeing you on TV,

04:47.054 --> 04:49.757
"but I can't show it
to my church group.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.092
Do you think maybe you
could not swear this time?"

04:52.125 --> 04:54.495
- Your design period is closed.

04:54.528 --> 04:57.831
Your three-hour forge time
starts now.

04:57.865 --> 05:01.402
[rock music]

05:01.435 --> 05:03.371
- When you're forge welding
barbed wire,

05:03.404 --> 05:05.606
it doesn't end up making
that much steel.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.375
The best thing
that they could do

05:07.408 --> 05:09.743
is twist the wire
as tight as they can

05:09.777 --> 05:10.978
and keep doubling over
and twisting it,

05:11.011 --> 05:13.414
doing all that cold,

05:13.447 --> 05:16.049
and then compressing it into as
small of a bundle as they can,

05:16.083 --> 05:18.586
and then forge weld that
into a bar.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.454
- How am I gonna do this
in three hours?

05:20.488 --> 05:22.823
That's the first thing
that goes through my head.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.459
My plan is to make a billet
out of the barbed wire,

05:25.493 --> 05:28.829
make a billet
out of the 1084, weld,

05:28.862 --> 05:33.367
and make a sweet-looking
forge-a-licious blade.

05:33.401 --> 05:34.968
I'm twisting it tight.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.037
I'm trying to make me
a nice cable out of it.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.006
Then I know when I forge weld
it, it's gonna stick.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.541
- Wow, look at that.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.942
He's putting some muscle
into it.

05:41.975 --> 05:42.910
- There you go.
Look at him go, man.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.578
This is a good idea.

05:44.612 --> 05:47.815
*

05:47.848 --> 05:50.918
- Barbed wire and I are gonna
have to go on a first date.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.120
It might be
a little bit awkward,

05:53.153 --> 05:58.025
but in the end,
barbed wire's got to marry me.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.461
I have to get a little bit
handsy with Barb.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.162
- Josh is doing what I was
talking about:

06:02.195 --> 06:05.533
he's bundling it cold
to get it compressed down

06:05.566 --> 06:08.536
as small as he can get it
before he forge welds it.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.970
- I just got to give her
a little bit more love

06:10.003 --> 06:12.873
and affection, because...

06:12.906 --> 06:15.108
Barb's a prickly bitch.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.177
*

06:17.210 --> 06:19.713
- My plan for the knife
is to try to infuse

06:19.747 --> 06:23.150
the barbed wire toward the spine
on the 1084

06:23.183 --> 06:25.486
and not have so much
along the cutting edge,

06:25.519 --> 06:28.856
'cause I don't know how hard
I can get that barbed wire.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.124
*

06:31.158 --> 06:33.461
I'm gonna hammer the bar flat.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.496
I'm gonna take 6-inch strips
of the barbed wire,

06:35.529 --> 06:37.097
hammer 'em flat,

06:37.130 --> 06:40.133
and then forge weld them
into the metal.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.903
If the forge weld holds,
I'm gonna do it again,

06:42.936 --> 06:44.772
and we'll see what happens.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.907
How crazy is this barbed wire?

06:46.940 --> 06:48.609
Whoo!

06:48.642 --> 06:50.578
- I love the way
he says "barbed wire."

06:50.611 --> 06:52.980
- "Barbed wire."

06:53.013 --> 06:55.048
- The hardest part
about using barbed wire

06:55.082 --> 06:57.485
is that, being small,

06:57.518 --> 07:00.621
trying to forge weld that
to something thicker...

07:00.654 --> 07:03.891
- Ray Kirk, the only smith in
the history of "Forged in Fire"

07:03.924 --> 07:05.526
to finish 45 minutes early

07:05.559 --> 07:07.027
and ask for a cup of coffee.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.763
- I'm getting kind of dry.

07:09.797 --> 07:15.135
My plan is to make two equal
bundles of the barbed wire

07:15.168 --> 07:18.105
and to squeeze them down
to as small as I can get 'em

07:18.138 --> 07:22.810
so I have two pieces
to put on each side.

07:22.843 --> 07:26.113
- You have two hours remaining
to finish your work!

07:26.146 --> 07:27.681
- Whoo!

07:27.715 --> 07:29.717
- [chuckling]

07:29.750 --> 07:32.986
- My barbed wire's cooking.
I got my 1080.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.922
When you look at that
little bar, you're terrified.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.624
You don't know
if you've got enough metal.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.826
So I really draw it out.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.762
- Chad got his metal moved.
Drawn out and everything.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.697
- His billet looked beautiful.

07:43.731 --> 07:47.134
- I like my blades to be maximum
length for cutting power.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.902
I get my 10-inch
maximum length,

07:48.936 --> 07:52.105
but I draw out lots of excess.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.742
That's gonna be
part of my san mai-style

07:54.775 --> 07:59.580
Damascus billet that's gonna go
with the barbed wire.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.114
My blade is gonna rock.

08:01.148 --> 08:04.652
*

08:04.685 --> 08:07.054
- I have a forge welded piece,

08:07.087 --> 08:11.859
but this blade right now
is giving me some problems.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.595
I've got a blade
that looks like this,

08:14.628 --> 08:16.564
and it's way too sharp
of a curve.

08:16.597 --> 08:17.631
[bleep].

08:17.665 --> 08:19.633
Sorry, Aunt Edie.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.302
- I'm not sure exactly
what Josh has got going on.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.606
Right now, it looks like he's
got the blade of a hockey stick.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.776
- Last time I was here,
I spazzed out,

08:28.809 --> 08:31.679
and I really don't want
to do that this time,

08:31.712 --> 08:34.982
so I'm just trying to stay calm.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.051
*

08:38.085 --> 08:40.320
- Oh, dang, Robby's got a knife
over there. Look at that.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.556
- He is really moving along.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.157
- I'm grinding the slag off

08:44.191 --> 08:47.561
the sides of the blade
to check my forge weld.

08:47.595 --> 08:50.998
It's a good, solid weld.
I'm extremely excited.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.133
I'm gonna rock this thing.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.735
- I have a question about Robby.

08:54.768 --> 08:55.936
What stays on longer:

08:55.969 --> 08:57.771
the cowboy hat or the boots?

08:57.805 --> 08:59.272
- Oh, cowboy hat.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.041
Cowboy dresses
from the top down.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.577
I'm dressed from the bottom up.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.913
- The last time on the show,
I got extremely hot,

09:05.946 --> 09:07.848
but this time,

09:07.881 --> 09:10.651
if I get any hotter,
I'm taking these pants off.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.654
If I still continue to overheat,
I'm taking my shirt off.

09:13.687 --> 09:16.356
If I continue to overheat,
I'm gonna take my hat off,

09:16.389 --> 09:17.958
and I'm gonna forge you
this blade.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.961
[retching]

09:23.330 --> 09:26.199
Whoo! I like it!

09:26.233 --> 09:29.937
- I have the blade
in the size that I want,

09:29.970 --> 09:32.339
so I weld on the barbed wire...

09:32.372 --> 09:34.141
- Man, I really like Ray Kirk.

09:34.174 --> 09:37.044
Just seeing how much joy
he gets out of making--

09:37.077 --> 09:39.212
I really like
seeing him in here.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.948
- I'm gonna tear it up.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.983
*

09:43.016 --> 09:45.686
The rhythm
of a good air hammer

09:45.719 --> 09:47.888
is hard for a bladesmith
to resist.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.823
[hammer pounding]

09:49.857 --> 09:52.793
It's kind of like,
"Thump, thump, thump, thump,"

09:52.826 --> 09:54.928
kind of like the drums
in the jungle.

09:54.962 --> 09:58.398
They call you to go out
late at night...

09:58.431 --> 09:59.900
[percussive music]

09:59.933 --> 10:02.169
Get crazy.

10:02.202 --> 10:05.639
- You have only one hour left
to finish your blades!

10:05.673 --> 10:07.841
[rock music]

10:07.875 --> 10:12.112
- My blade is finally
where I can accept it,

10:12.145 --> 10:14.181
and I don't want to waste
any more time.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.884
I want to get this
to heat treat.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.953
- Josh is really being careful
with his whole thermocycling.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.789
- That's good.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.792
- I pull out my blade
on the final cycle,

10:24.825 --> 10:26.727
and I'm ready to quench.

10:26.760 --> 10:30.898
*

10:30.931 --> 10:34.034
Pull it out--
initially, it's looking good.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.236
So I go, "All right, let's cool
it off a little bit more."

10:36.269 --> 10:37.838
*

10:37.871 --> 10:39.973
[bleep].

10:40.007 --> 10:43.110
At this point,
I think I cool it off too much,

10:43.143 --> 10:45.846
because it starts going...whoop.

10:45.879 --> 10:46.847
*

10:46.880 --> 10:48.916
[bleep].

10:48.949 --> 10:51.118
The blade just continues...

10:51.151 --> 10:53.353
*

10:53.386 --> 10:55.055
- I don't know about you guys,
but I'm starting

10:55.088 --> 10:57.424
to see some frustration
with Josh there.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.828
That significant of a warp
is hard to come back from.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.731
- Right now, I'm somewhere
in between pissing my pants

11:03.764 --> 11:05.265
and throwing up
all over the place.

11:05.298 --> 11:11.004
*

11:11.038 --> 11:15.308
going to be
able to get this warp out,

11:15.342 --> 11:18.345
and even though
I'm running out of time,

11:18.378 --> 11:19.813
I make the decision:

11:19.847 --> 11:22.049
I'm going to quench again.

11:22.082 --> 11:25.052
[rock music]

11:25.085 --> 11:26.787
- I kind of like
the shape of Chad's blade.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.421
- It's too long.

11:28.455 --> 11:31.124
- That's a temporary problem.
- I hope so.

11:31.158 --> 11:34.294
- I measure.
It's too long.

11:34.327 --> 11:38.732
So I go over to the grinder,
and I'm just going to town.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.367
I'm about to panic.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.802
I don't think I'm gonna
quench this blade.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.136
*

11:43.170 --> 11:44.337
- Come on, baby.

11:44.371 --> 11:48.241
Straight, hard, no cracks.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.509
The last time I was on the show,

11:49.542 --> 11:52.112
my blade did not
heat-treat good.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.114
It had some hard spots
and soft spots,

11:54.147 --> 11:56.116
so this time,

11:56.149 --> 12:00.420
I'm really ensuring myself
on a good, hard quench.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.490
The blade is born
when it goes into the quench,

12:03.523 --> 12:06.794
and it's straight,
and it's hard.

12:06.827 --> 12:07.928
It's straight.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.129
It's hard.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.764
It's a boy!

12:10.798 --> 12:13.300
- I love to hear
Robby's commentary.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.469
- That's a good way to get bit
by a rattlesnake, ain't it?

12:16.503 --> 12:19.372
*

12:19.406 --> 12:21.541
- Last time on the show,
I quenched my blade,

12:21.574 --> 12:24.077
and it warped horribly.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.880
This time,
I'm not taking any chances,

12:26.914 --> 12:29.516
so I do an edge quench.

12:29.549 --> 12:33.086
- I guess Chad's gonna just use
Ray's oil to quench there.

12:33.120 --> 12:37.557
*

12:37.590 --> 12:41.094
He's got fire, fire!
- Yes!

12:41.128 --> 12:43.530
- Chad seems very happy
with his quench there.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.198
- Ready or not, here I come.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.267
- Chad passed the torch off
to Ray.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.568
- That was cool.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.270
- The last time I was here,

12:50.303 --> 12:52.439
my blade was not hard.

12:52.472 --> 12:57.911
I did a different heat treat,
and I didn't do it properly.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.380
This time, I'm going to
heat-treat my blade

13:00.413 --> 13:04.217
with a torch,
the way I do at home.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.586
- A little happy dance,
and in the oil.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.221
[dramatic music]

13:08.255 --> 13:11.424
- Ten, nine, eight,

13:11.458 --> 13:15.162
seven, six, five, four...

13:15.195 --> 13:16.229
- Watch out, ripple.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.899
- Three, two, one.

13:18.932 --> 13:21.301
Bladesmiths, shut down
your machines, drop your tools.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.603
The forging time is over.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.139
*

13:26.173 --> 13:28.408
- During this challenge,
there were a couple of times

13:28.441 --> 13:31.278
where I might have started
to overheat,

13:31.311 --> 13:33.346
and I would just think
about why I'm here:

13:33.380 --> 13:35.082
the fans voted me,

13:35.115 --> 13:37.550
and that brought
my attention

13:37.584 --> 13:39.486
back where it should have been
to start with.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.990
*

13:43.023 --> 13:45.525
- Bladesmiths, in this
first round of competition,

13:45.558 --> 13:47.861
you had three hours
to make signature blades

13:47.895 --> 13:49.429
between 8 and 10 inches

13:49.462 --> 13:52.432
using 1084 steel
and barbed wire.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.167
Now it's time for the judges

13:54.201 --> 13:56.303
to take a closer look
at your blades.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.438
Robby, you're up first.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.874
*

14:00.908 --> 14:02.509
- Well, Robby, I am impressed

14:02.542 --> 14:05.312
that you were able to get
the barbed wire to stick.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.415
There's not much of it,
but it is there.

14:08.448 --> 14:12.352
You got some warp going on,
but overall, well done.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.587
- Thank you, sir.
- You're up next, Ray.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.190
Please present your work
to the judges.

14:17.224 --> 14:20.160
*

14:20.193 --> 14:23.630
- Being one of the youngest
competitors in this group,

14:23.663 --> 14:27.067
you brought so much fun
into it to show everyone

14:27.100 --> 14:29.602
that you can do your best work
when you're having fun.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.205
- When you get older,
you can afford to have more fun.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.141
- It shows in your work.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.910
It's nice to see your profile
in your blade here.

14:36.944 --> 14:39.479
It feels good in the hand.
Good job, sir.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.315
- Thank you, sir.
- All right, Josh. You're up.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.351
Please present your work
to the judges.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.354
*

14:47.387 --> 14:49.622
- For what we're doing,
this shape is great.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.691
It's got that really
aggressive point on it.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.994
It's got a nice
chopping surface on it.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.029
There's a couple of places
where the welds--

14:56.063 --> 14:57.164
I can get a finger in 'em,

14:57.197 --> 14:59.466
but they're not peeling up.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.668
All in all, looking good.
- Thank you.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.403
- Chad, you're up.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.372
Please present your work
to the judges.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.341
*

15:08.375 --> 15:10.077
- What I really liked is,

15:10.110 --> 15:12.579
the welds are all clean
and really nice.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.581
Your steel's fantastic,

15:14.614 --> 15:17.084
and it's just got that classic
chopping shape to it.

15:17.117 --> 15:20.253
But it looks really big to me.

15:20.287 --> 15:24.992
*

15:25.025 --> 15:26.994
Ah...

15:27.027 --> 15:33.967
*

15:35.702 --> 15:39.106
I'm measuring
from your tip to your plunge,

15:39.139 --> 15:42.242
and I saw you measure this
a lot,

15:42.275 --> 15:43.676
and you're about 1/4 inch over.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.645
*

15:45.678 --> 15:48.481
- I thought it was
below 10 inches.

15:48.515 --> 15:52.986
- You're 1/4 inch
over the length.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.688
- Chad, this is a competition.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.291
Your blade, being outside
of the parameters,

15:58.325 --> 16:01.528
does not qualify you
for the second round.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.363
For that reason,
I have to ask you

16:03.396 --> 16:06.433
to please leave the Forge.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.301
- I thought
my blade was rocking.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.238
I thought I had
a forge-a-licious blade.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.140
It's just a kick in the butt--

16:13.173 --> 16:14.741
another lesson learned.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.443
They always told me,
"Go big or go home,"

16:16.476 --> 16:19.646
and I went big,
and I went home.

16:19.679 --> 16:20.780
- All right, gentlemen.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.449
You're all fortunate enough

16:22.482 --> 16:24.017
to have made it
to the second round

16:24.051 --> 16:25.152
because somebody
failed to follow

16:25.185 --> 16:27.254
the rules in the first round,

16:27.287 --> 16:29.756
but don't think you'll earn
a spot in the final that easily.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.025
Of course, in this round,
you'll be putting handles

16:32.059 --> 16:35.128
on your blades to turn them
into fully functional weapons.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.330
Just to make things
a little bit more difficult,

16:37.364 --> 16:38.765
you'll also
have to include a guard

16:38.798 --> 16:41.734
into your handle's design.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.137
You will have three hours
in this round.

16:44.171 --> 16:47.440
Good luck, bladesmiths.
Your three hours starts now.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.675
[rock music]

16:48.708 --> 16:50.077
- And away we go.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.145
- Whoo!
- Whoo! Hoo!

16:52.179 --> 16:53.213
- What do you think
about putting guards

16:53.246 --> 16:55.215
on these knives, Jason?

16:55.248 --> 16:56.716
- Well, we didn't tell them
what the guard material

16:56.749 --> 16:58.718
hard to be, and traditionally,

16:58.751 --> 17:01.721
guards are brass
or bronze or steel.

17:01.754 --> 17:05.592
- My plan is to first
grind my knife down

17:05.625 --> 17:08.328
to where I know the thickness

17:08.361 --> 17:11.264
of the slot
to make for the guard.

17:11.298 --> 17:14.201
You have to do that before
you can proceed any further.

17:14.234 --> 17:17.270
My plans are to finish
this blade in time for coffee.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.639
*

17:19.672 --> 17:22.409
- The first thing I'm gonna do
is grind my blade

17:22.442 --> 17:24.344
to try to get
some of the warp out of it.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.745
- Robby's got to be
really careful,

17:25.778 --> 17:27.680
because his blade
was already thin,

17:27.714 --> 17:31.218
and I see him over there
grinding on it pretty hardcore.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.353
- The warp in my blade--
it's in an area

17:33.386 --> 17:35.355
that my handles
might not fit properly,

17:35.388 --> 17:37.657
so it was serious to get
that warp out.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.726
*

17:39.759 --> 17:43.096
- I'm going to use brass
for my guard material

17:43.130 --> 17:45.865
and wood for my handle.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.101
One of my daughters knew
that last time,

17:48.135 --> 17:51.504
I had trouble
with the handle challenge,

17:51.538 --> 17:53.573
so before I left
to come here this time,

17:53.606 --> 17:55.442
she gave me a card.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.810
This is the card
that she made me,

17:57.844 --> 18:00.413
and these are the different
handles for different things.

18:00.447 --> 18:03.750
These are longer handles,
and the shorter ones.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.418
[gentle music]

18:05.452 --> 18:07.520
Thank you, Josephine,
for the help.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.722
- You have only two hours
remaining

18:09.756 --> 18:11.458
until the weapons tests.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.460
[rock music]

18:13.493 --> 18:17.330
So everything's pretty much
as we expected with Ray:

18:17.364 --> 18:19.132
nice and slow and steady.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.301
- Hey, easy well done
is awesome.

18:21.334 --> 18:24.137
- I decided on a brass guard,
and I'm gonna use

18:24.171 --> 18:26.139
brown linen Micarta
for the handle.

18:26.173 --> 18:29.342
This is strong,
and this is strong.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.244
This is strong too.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.713
*

18:33.746 --> 18:36.849
- The Kirinite looked like
barbed wire.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.152
I thought that would incorporate
the theme

18:39.186 --> 18:40.787
with the barbed wire blade,

18:40.820 --> 18:42.755
so I grabbed that,

18:42.789 --> 18:45.592
and then I grabbed some antler
for the guard.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.661
The antler will give it
more character.

18:48.695 --> 18:52.232
And I'm gonna slot this into
an S and get it up in there.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.800
- He was talking about
cutting an S shape

18:53.833 --> 18:55.535
out of the antler scale.

18:55.568 --> 18:59.606
- That will not be
visually appealing to me.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.609
- That's big, bad,
and ugly, ain't it?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.611
*

19:04.644 --> 19:06.279
- I need to put a pin
in the guard

19:06.313 --> 19:08.448
so it won't fly off.

19:08.481 --> 19:12.219
I feel confident that a pin
is the right way to go,

19:12.252 --> 19:15.522
but my guard isn't as secure
as I want it...

19:15.555 --> 19:17.590
[bleep].

19:17.624 --> 19:20.293
So my option now is to just try

19:20.327 --> 19:23.363
to squeeze the guard on

19:23.396 --> 19:25.932
and just hold it there
by pressure.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.335
- Josh over here is having
a little bit of trouble

19:28.368 --> 19:29.602
with his brass guard.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.604
- When I squish it in the press,

19:31.638 --> 19:35.408
squish has way bigger muscles
than me, and it just...

19:35.442 --> 19:37.277
[blows raspberry]

19:37.310 --> 19:39.512
Ruined it.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.581
[bleep].

19:41.614 --> 19:43.616
I hope that I can fix it,

19:43.650 --> 19:47.620
because if I can't produce
a guard, that's it for me.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.656
- He's walking in circles.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.325
That could be
the brain shutting down.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.660
- I'm done.

19:53.693 --> 19:58.931
[bleep].

19:58.965 --> 20:01.601
- Josh is having trouble
with his brass guard.

20:01.634 --> 20:04.971
- If I can't produce
a guard, I'm done.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.006
And I didn't come here
to be done,

20:07.039 --> 20:10.877
so I have to abandon ship.

20:10.910 --> 20:14.447
- He's cut it off.
- Oh. So he's starting over.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.416
- I don't know if he has enough
time to make another guard.

20:16.449 --> 20:19.686
[dramatic music]

20:19.719 --> 20:21.554
Ray Kirk over here
on the grinder,

20:21.588 --> 20:24.857
just doing what Ray Kirk does:
making knives.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.294
- At this point,
I'm grinding my blade down

20:27.327 --> 20:30.463
so that I can etch it
and then sharpen it.

20:30.497 --> 20:33.866
*

20:33.900 --> 20:35.768
- I'm working really hard.

20:35.802 --> 20:39.372
Clock's a-ticking.
My heart's a-pumping.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.408
I'm working
with an aggressive belt

20:41.441 --> 20:43.576
to remove as much material
as possible

20:43.610 --> 20:46.346
from the handle
and the guard.

20:46.379 --> 20:50.683
- My biggest concern with Robby
is how thin his handle is.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.519
- I've seen a lot
of classic bowies

20:52.552 --> 20:55.422
where the handle is very thin,

20:55.455 --> 20:57.324
but they aren't very
comfortable to use.

20:57.357 --> 21:01.294
*

21:01.328 --> 21:03.463
- I finally got a new guard on.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.064
I'm happy with it.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.966
- Josh has got
a very unique shape there.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.702
It's gonna be interesting
to see how it works.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.804
- After my sharpness test
failure

21:11.838 --> 21:13.640
the last time I was here,

21:13.673 --> 21:16.008
I had a three-month dry spell.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.877
Nobody bought a knife.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.046
What good is a knife
if it's not sharp?

21:20.079 --> 21:23.550
So my business depends

21:23.583 --> 21:25.485
on this blade being sharp.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.086
*

21:27.119 --> 21:30.757
- Ten, nine, eight, seven,

21:30.790 --> 21:34.026
six, five, four,

21:34.060 --> 21:37.029
three, two, one.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.865
Bladesmiths, drop your tools,

21:38.898 --> 21:40.767
secure your blades,
head back to your anvils.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.569
- Whoo!

21:42.602 --> 21:45.705
I like it.
- Cheers, men.

21:49.976 --> 21:53.713
but as I'm looking at it,
thatI'm changing my mind.dy,

21:53.746 --> 21:56.082
This is a beautiful blade.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.784
- Bladesmiths, this is

21:57.817 --> 21:59.719
the strength
and durability test.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.788
I'll be taking your knives

22:01.821 --> 22:04.724
and chopping
into this barbed wire twice.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.359
Robby, are you ready?

22:06.393 --> 22:08.528
- I'm ready.
- You better be.

22:08.561 --> 22:11.698
- The knife is too.
- Good.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.966
- I'm up first for this test,
and I don't know

22:14.000 --> 22:15.435
if it's a good thing
or a bad thing,

22:15.468 --> 22:16.836
but I'm nervous right now.

22:16.869 --> 22:23.843
*

22:31.150 --> 22:32.685
- We did get a little bit
of edge damage...

22:32.719 --> 22:34.454
- Okay.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.623
- I am surprised, though,
that this handle

22:36.656 --> 22:38.658
didn't give me
much more trouble than it did.

22:38.691 --> 22:43.129
It actually--it indexes well,
even though it's square.

22:43.162 --> 22:45.432
Josh, you're next.

22:45.465 --> 22:52.371
*

23:03.182 --> 23:05.952
Well, Josh, it looks like

23:05.985 --> 23:09.522
your edge has no damage.

23:09.556 --> 23:12.759
So all that time you took
in heat treating,

23:12.792 --> 23:14.794
your thermocycling, paid off.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.429
Overall, well done.

23:16.463 --> 23:19.699
- Thank you.
- Good job.

23:19.732 --> 23:23.402
- Ray, I know you're ready.
- Always ready.

23:23.636 --> 23:30.577
*

23:37.049 --> 23:40.019
- Ray, I like the way
your knife feels...

23:40.052 --> 23:41.654
- Thank you.

23:41.688 --> 23:43.222
- A little bit
on the thick side,

23:43.255 --> 23:45.091
but it still has got
the kind of edge

23:45.124 --> 23:46.626
that just gets into things,

23:46.659 --> 23:48.595
so overall, well done, Ray.

23:48.628 --> 23:50.162
- Thank you, sir.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.664
- For the sharpness test,

23:51.698 --> 23:54.467
I'll be turning you over
to Doug.

23:54.501 --> 23:56.135
Hi, Doug.

23:56.168 --> 23:58.705
- Bladesmiths,
I'm gonna take your weapon,

23:58.738 --> 24:00.139
and I'm gonna see
how well it stabs,

24:00.172 --> 24:02.008
and I'm gonna see
how well it cuts

24:02.041 --> 24:04.844
on these Kevlar-reinforced bags.

24:04.877 --> 24:07.847
Let's see if your weapons
are for real.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.148
Robby, you're up first.
You ready?

24:09.181 --> 24:15.221
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do this.

24:15.254 --> 24:16.823
- I'm sitting there,
thinking to myself,

24:16.856 --> 24:17.824
"My little bit
of an edge problem

24:17.857 --> 24:19.659
from the first test

24:19.692 --> 24:21.694
might have me
behind the other two."

24:21.728 --> 24:24.631
[rock music]

24:24.664 --> 24:31.638
*

24:31.671 --> 24:33.806
- Okay, Robby.
Stabbing was good.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.543
Of the three layers,
you only cut through two.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.879
Overall, your blade is sharp
to stab and cut.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.648
- Yes.
- Good job.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.215
- Thank you.
- Josh, you're up next.

24:43.249 --> 24:46.786
You ready?
- I'm dying for this redemption.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.088
I have been waiting a long time

24:49.121 --> 24:51.624
to get another one
of my blades in Doug's hand.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.192
- It's got some spots here

24:53.225 --> 24:55.094
that I can run my hand
safely through it.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.664
It doesn't cut as well
as I thought it wod.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.165
- It needs to cut.

24:59.198 --> 25:05.672
*

25:05.705 --> 25:09.241
- Okay, Josh, the edge you have
over here is sharp enough.

25:09.275 --> 25:12.879
It lacerated the first layer,
but not into the second layer.

25:12.912 --> 25:16.816
Overall, it is sharp enough
to puncture and lacerate.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.250
Good job.
- Thank you.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.186
- Ray, are you ready?

25:20.219 --> 25:22.655
- I'm always ready.
- It's your turn. Let's go.

25:22.689 --> 25:25.592
- I'm always excited to see
Doug wield his blades.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.226
He's got the moves.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.695
[laughing]

25:28.728 --> 25:35.668
*

25:38.304 --> 25:40.272
- Your edge over here lacerated
through two layers,

25:40.306 --> 25:41.741
the outer layer
and the first layer,

25:41.774 --> 25:43.275
of the Kevlar-reinforced bag,

25:43.309 --> 25:44.977
so it's sharp.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.579
It will cut.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.047
- Perfect.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.951
[dramatic music]

25:51.984 --> 25:54.353
- They're gonna have
a real tough decision this time.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.922
- I hope.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.056
- All right, judges,
our bladesmiths

25:57.089 --> 25:58.190
have turned in their work.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.126
Let's take a closer look.

26:00.159 --> 26:03.195
I'd like to start
with Robby's blade right here.

26:03.229 --> 26:06.733
- Robby's blade was the one that
I was most concerned with.

26:06.766 --> 26:09.902
It did work okay,
but the biggest problem was,

26:09.936 --> 26:14.941
Robby had edge damage
all the way down the edge.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.175
- Dave, why don't you go ahead

26:16.208 --> 26:17.677
and pick up Ray's blade?

26:17.710 --> 26:19.612
*

26:19.646 --> 26:21.313
- What he did
that I really like is,

26:21.347 --> 26:23.750
he left enough material
in this blade--

26:23.783 --> 26:25.017
there's enough mass
in this blade--

26:25.051 --> 26:26.953
for that barbed wire chop.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.387
His fit is great.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.790
The handle's comfortable
in the hand.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.825
Ray does great work.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.727
- Let's move on to Josh's blade.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.162
*

26:36.195 --> 26:37.329
- The feel of the handle
is good.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.699
I can index well.

26:39.732 --> 26:42.702
In the testing, it penetrated
in the thrust, in the cuts.

26:42.735 --> 26:44.637
It only cut through one
of the three layers,

26:44.671 --> 26:46.839
not into the Kevlar.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.741
- All right, judges, it's time
to make a final decision.

26:48.775 --> 26:50.009
Doug, have you made yours?

26:50.042 --> 26:51.110
- Yes, I have.
- Dave?

26:51.143 --> 26:52.812
- Oh, yeah.
- Jason?

26:52.845 --> 26:55.782
- Yeah, man.
- Let's go tell our smiths.

26:55.815 --> 26:58.217
Bladesmiths, the judges
have made a final decision,

26:58.250 --> 27:00.186
and it's time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

27:00.219 --> 27:04.724
*

27:04.757 --> 27:08.060
Robby, your blade
did not make the cut.

27:08.094 --> 27:11.898
- Robby, this isn't about what
your knife does to the test;

27:11.931 --> 27:14.033
it's about what the test
does to your knife.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.835
Out of all three blades,

27:15.868 --> 27:18.104
your blade had
the most edge damage,

27:18.137 --> 27:19.906
and that's why we have
to send you home.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.674
- Okay.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.843
- Robby, please surrender
your weapon.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.945
*

27:25.978 --> 27:28.147
- You know, I have no regrets.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.116
The last time, I didn't get
to finish the knife.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.751
I didn't get to see it tested.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.285
This time I did.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.789
I've accomplished
what I come to do.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.758
*

27:38.791 --> 27:40.359
[exhales sharply]

27:40.392 --> 27:41.794
You know, even though
I didn't become

27:41.828 --> 27:43.996
the "Forged in Fire" champion,

27:44.030 --> 27:46.198
there's a lot
of people behind me, and...

27:46.232 --> 27:48.034
*

27:48.067 --> 27:49.201
[exhales sharply]

27:49.235 --> 27:50.803
I can't do this, y'all.

27:50.837 --> 27:54.874
*

27:54.907 --> 27:56.743
- Josh, Ray, congratulations.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.277
You're both one step closer
to the title

27:58.310 --> 28:00.012
of "Forged in Fire" champion

28:00.046 --> 28:01.881
and that check for ten grand.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.249
When you came here,
you used our tools

28:03.282 --> 28:05.117
and equipment
to make your blades;

28:05.151 --> 28:06.886
now we're sending you back
to your home forges,

28:06.919 --> 28:08.254
where you will have five days

28:08.287 --> 28:10.890
to make an iconic weapon
in history.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.825
Are you ready to see
what that weapon is?

28:12.859 --> 28:13.860
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

28:13.893 --> 28:14.894
- All right.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.395
*

28:16.428 --> 28:17.964
- The panabas.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.098
- Okay.

28:19.131 --> 28:21.233
*

28:21.267 --> 28:24.270
- Known as a chopping tool
for both agriculture and combat,

28:24.303 --> 28:26.739
the panabas earned its place
as a weapon of war

28:26.773 --> 28:29.008
in the southern Philippines
during the 19th century.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.143
Its sharp,
forward-curved blade

28:31.177 --> 28:33.012
acted like an oversized
meat cleaver

28:33.045 --> 28:34.881
and delivered deep,
clean cuts,

28:34.914 --> 28:37.416
which made it ideal
for executions.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.752
On the battlefield,
warriors carrying the panabas

28:39.786 --> 28:41.320
would follow behind
the front lines

28:41.353 --> 28:44.123
and behead anyone unlucky enough
to have survived

28:44.156 --> 28:45.524
the first wave of attacks.

28:45.557 --> 28:46.826
*

28:46.859 --> 28:48.194
The length of the blade

28:48.227 --> 28:50.863
must fall between
18 and 20 inches,

28:50.897 --> 28:52.431
and the overall length
of your weapon

28:52.464 --> 28:55.935
must be between
35 and 37 inches.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.503
You will return
and present your panabases

28:57.536 --> 28:59.138
to our panel of expert judges,

28:59.171 --> 29:00.406
and only after they've put them

29:00.439 --> 29:02.875
through a series
of extreme tests

29:02.909 --> 29:04.343
will they declare one of you
the champion

29:04.376 --> 29:05.845
and hand you that check.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.379
- When we hit testing,

29:07.413 --> 29:10.182
my panabas has to be
super sharp.

29:10.216 --> 29:14.220
The last time I went to
the final round, I fell short.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.522
- Five days is just
way too much time

29:16.555 --> 29:19.425
for that particular weapon,
I think.

29:19.458 --> 29:22.528
I may change my tune whenever
I start hammering on it,

29:22.561 --> 29:24.964
but that's part of the game.

29:24.997 --> 29:28.534
- Do your best work.
Good luck, bladesmiths.

29:28.567 --> 29:29.468
- See you in five days.

29:29.501 --> 29:33.272
*

29:33.305 --> 29:37.076
- Today is day one,
and what I plan on doing today

29:37.109 --> 29:41.981
is to cut the steel
and forge it to the shape,

29:42.014 --> 29:43.883
and we'll just see
where it goes from there.

29:43.916 --> 29:46.986
*

29:47.019 --> 29:49.956
This is the first time
I've ever undertaken a project

29:49.989 --> 29:53.993
that had a curved blade
that was over 18 inches long,

29:54.026 --> 29:56.462
but this one, I just love it.

29:56.495 --> 29:58.931
Itay be a bit of a challenge
to get the curve,

29:58.965 --> 30:00.132
of course, correctly,

30:00.166 --> 30:02.534
but I think I can do that.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.403
It's looking very good
at this point.

30:04.436 --> 30:07.974
*

30:08.007 --> 30:10.342
- Let's get it lit.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.111
I'm home, I'm prepped,

30:12.144 --> 30:14.446
and I'm ready to build
a panabas,

30:14.480 --> 30:17.049
a weird-looking blade.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.384
I'm not even sure
how to describe it,

30:18.417 --> 30:20.386
and I've certainly
never built one.

30:20.419 --> 30:23.990
It's always so much fun
to watch it squish in the press.

30:24.023 --> 30:27.559
My plan is to put some of
the fancier elements to it.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.461
[press whirring]

30:29.495 --> 30:31.363
Ah, [bleep].

30:31.397 --> 30:34.566
My press has seized up.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.368
This is one of those things

30:36.402 --> 30:39.438
that could be
a devastating three-hour fix,

30:39.471 --> 30:41.573
and I have to have this machine.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.475
It's one of those things that

30:43.509 --> 30:46.545
I haven't had to deal with
in about a year,

30:46.578 --> 30:50.950
and of course, as soon as I
come home to do the final round,

30:50.983 --> 30:53.552
something like this
has to happen.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.254
I have to fix this,

30:55.287 --> 30:58.590
or I may just lose
the entire day.

30:58.624 --> 31:04.496
*

31:04.530 --> 31:06.598
- The most challenging
thing today

31:06.632 --> 31:09.668
is to get my blade ready
for heat treat.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.071
Whoo! Watch that torch, bud.

31:12.104 --> 31:15.641
*

31:15.674 --> 31:17.676
Not bad.

31:17.709 --> 31:21.680
Building the panabas
has been extremely fast.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.950
Got it all tempered,
the handle attached,

31:23.983 --> 31:26.218
bark shaped.

31:26.252 --> 31:31.390
This is wet rawhide to keep
everything pretty solid,

31:31.423 --> 31:33.926
and if everything
holds together good,

31:33.960 --> 31:37.363
we'll put the final--rats.

31:37.396 --> 31:40.699
The rawhide--it broke,

31:40.732 --> 31:43.435
and I didn't really have enough
to finish it,

31:43.469 --> 31:46.672
so I pulled strands
out of some paracord,

31:46.705 --> 31:48.574
and I made sure
that I had enough

31:48.607 --> 31:50.476
to go from one end to the other.

31:50.509 --> 31:51.677
[press whirring]

31:51.710 --> 31:55.147
- Oh, who's back in action?

31:55.181 --> 31:57.449
I need to make up for some
lost time from yesterday,

31:57.483 --> 32:00.186
so I'm going to spend
the day forging

32:00.219 --> 32:02.021
and just smoothing out
all the bumps.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.423
It's just starting to slim out.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.158
*

32:06.192 --> 32:07.726
Rough grind, done.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.196
*

32:10.229 --> 32:12.698
- I plan to test
the edge of my knife,

32:12.731 --> 32:14.300
cutting some saplings down,

32:14.333 --> 32:16.302
and I stole my dog's bone,

32:16.335 --> 32:18.504
and I'm gonna chop that
and see how it works.

32:18.537 --> 32:21.440
[rock music]

32:21.473 --> 32:26.178
*

32:26.212 --> 32:27.479
Now for the bone chop.

32:27.513 --> 32:30.983
*

32:31.017 --> 32:32.584
[dog whines]

32:32.618 --> 32:34.453
That's my baby.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.722
It performed excellent.

32:36.755 --> 32:40.592
This particular challenge went
exceptionally fast for me.

32:40.626 --> 32:43.462
Now, it's time to relax
for a little bit.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.331
*

32:45.364 --> 32:47.566
- I have wood prepped
for my handle,

32:47.599 --> 32:49.601
and I have it epoxied together,

32:49.635 --> 32:51.337
but I still don't have
anything close

32:51.370 --> 32:54.040
to looking like
a finished handle.

32:54.073 --> 32:57.343
But what I'm going to do
is test it to see

32:57.376 --> 33:01.047
if it's strong or not
before I do anything else.

33:01.080 --> 33:04.216
This test is a make-or-break
moment for me.

33:04.250 --> 33:07.319
If it doesn't pass,
I've essentially lost two days.

33:07.353 --> 33:14.160
*

33:14.193 --> 33:15.727
Damn, I like this sword.

33:15.761 --> 33:22.701
*

33:25.271 --> 33:27.039
It's one of those swords
that I feel like

33:27.073 --> 33:28.574
I should be at a stone wheel

33:28.607 --> 33:31.043
with a bicycle sharpener,
going...

33:31.077 --> 33:32.644
[imitating sharpener]

33:32.678 --> 33:35.414
At this point,
I could hand in my sword

33:35.447 --> 33:38.284
to the competition
and fare okay,

33:38.317 --> 33:41.753
but today, I want to take
the time to do embellishments

33:41.787 --> 33:43.589
and do fine detail work.

33:43.622 --> 33:46.658
Fortunately, I am an artist.

33:46.692 --> 33:49.661
Detail work could have
a significant payoff.

33:49.695 --> 33:53.465
If my sword and Ray's sword
perform exactly the same,

33:53.499 --> 33:56.802
it will be the defining factor
that gets me the win.

33:56.835 --> 34:00.372
I can live with that.
I'm gonna do some sweet

34:00.406 --> 34:02.608
little artistic touches
to the blade

34:02.641 --> 34:05.777
and make sure that this thing
is sharp as [bleep].

34:05.811 --> 34:07.679
Sorry, Aunt Edie.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.682
[dramatic music]

34:10.716 --> 34:12.584
*

34:12.618 --> 34:14.120
- Josh, Ray, welcome back.

34:14.153 --> 34:15.821
You've had five days

34:15.854 --> 34:18.524
at your home forge
to work on your panabases.

34:18.557 --> 34:22.194
Josh, how did it go?
- It went pretty well.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.330
I didn't like this blade
when I first saw it,

34:24.363 --> 34:27.099
but over the last five days,
I really fell in love with it.

34:27.133 --> 34:30.336
It's hard, it's sharp,
and it's ready for battle.

34:30.369 --> 34:31.737
- All right.
Ray, how'd it go for you?

34:31.770 --> 34:33.805
- I just found a new love.

34:33.839 --> 34:36.775
It's basically my style
of making knives to start with.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.510
It's just bigger.

34:38.544 --> 34:41.547
I didn't even need to use
all five days,

34:41.580 --> 34:43.782
and I really enjoyed it.

34:43.815 --> 34:45.684
- All right, gentlemen.
We're gonna see

34:45.717 --> 34:47.886
if your weapons can hold up
in a kill, strength,

34:47.919 --> 34:50.722
and sharpness test. Doug?

34:50.756 --> 34:52.558
*

34:52.591 --> 34:54.593
- This is the kill test,

34:54.626 --> 34:57.463
to see what kind of lethal
damage your panabas will do.

34:57.496 --> 34:59.198
I will take your weapon

34:59.231 --> 35:02.234
and deliver slashes
across this pig carcass.

35:02.268 --> 35:03.535
Josh, you're up first.
You ready?

35:03.569 --> 35:05.204
- Absolutely.
- Let's do this.

35:05.237 --> 35:06.772
*

35:06.805 --> 35:08.807
- Doug's about to cut this pig,

35:08.840 --> 35:10.709
and he does all these
prep strokes.

35:10.742 --> 35:11.910
My chest is just going...

35:11.943 --> 35:13.879
[imitating heart beating]

35:13.912 --> 35:20.786
*

35:23.689 --> 35:25.624
Yes.
- Okay, Josh.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.926
This is a scary weapon.

35:27.959 --> 35:31.597
It's got a sweet spot in there
that allows for a nice chop,

35:31.630 --> 35:35.701
and, of course, second chop
cut through the spine,

35:35.734 --> 35:37.936
the ribs, everything.

35:37.969 --> 35:41.473
Your panabas will kill.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.409
Good job.

35:43.442 --> 35:44.543
- Good job.
- All right, Ray.

35:44.576 --> 35:45.811
It's your turn. You ready?

35:45.844 --> 35:48.814
- You betcha.
- Let's do this.

35:48.847 --> 35:52.951
- I'm thinking, "I just got
to do as good as Josh did."

35:52.984 --> 35:56.455
But I loved it when Doug said,
"It will keel."

35:56.488 --> 35:57.923
That's with two Es.

35:57.956 --> 36:04.930
*

36:09.401 --> 36:11.670
- I didn't even need
a cup of coffee, Ray.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.505
- You betcha.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.607
- In the feel of this,
I can feel the blade

36:15.641 --> 36:17.443
already wanting to chop.

36:17.476 --> 36:20.746
The arc is right
where the sweet spot is.

36:20.779 --> 36:24.383
That allows the blade to cut
cleanly all the way through.

36:24.416 --> 36:27.886
And overall, your panabas
will kill.

36:27.919 --> 36:30.422
- My favorite.
- Next up is strength test.

36:30.456 --> 36:32.891
Dave?

36:32.924 --> 36:34.960
- Gentlemen, in 1521,

36:34.993 --> 36:37.496
the explorer Magellan landed
on the island of Cebu,

36:37.529 --> 36:39.798
sparking several decades
of conflict

36:39.831 --> 36:42.501
between the Philippines
and Spain.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.403
So to test your panabas,

36:44.436 --> 36:46.805
I'm going to strike
a Spanish morion twice

36:46.838 --> 36:48.940
with the edge of your weapon.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.343
Now, this is not about what
your weapon does to the helmet,

36:51.377 --> 36:55.414
but what the helmet does
to your weapon.

36:55.447 --> 36:56.782
Josh, you're up.
You ready?

36:56.815 --> 36:58.717
- Sure.
- Okay.

36:58.750 --> 37:05.691
*

37:19.438 --> 37:21.773
I n't see any wrinkling,
any deformation,

37:21.807 --> 37:24.643
any rolling upon your edge,
which is pretty amazing.

37:24.676 --> 37:25.977
I put some dents in that helmet.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.746
- [laughs]

37:27.779 --> 37:29.715
- Ray, you ready for this?

37:29.748 --> 37:31.417
- Can't hardly wait.
- Let's make it happen.

37:31.450 --> 37:38.390
*

37:47.533 --> 37:50.502
Okay, Ray, I can see
a little shiny spot here.

37:50.536 --> 37:52.304
It's just that wire edge feels

37:52.338 --> 37:55.307
like it's kind of tipped
just a hair.

37:55.341 --> 37:56.975
It's definitely still sharp.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.644
It's very nice.
Felt good in the hand.

37:58.677 --> 38:02.314
- Thank you.
- Next up is the sharpness test.

38:02.348 --> 38:04.015
For that,
I'll give you back to Doug.

38:04.049 --> 38:06.352
*

38:06.385 --> 38:08.954
- Bladesmiths, we know
your blades can kill,

38:08.987 --> 38:12.458
we know your blades are strong,
but are they still sharp?

38:12.491 --> 38:14.693
To test the edge retention
of your blade,

38:14.726 --> 38:16.628
I will take your panabas,
and I will cut the rope.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.930
That will release this sandbag,

38:18.964 --> 38:21.767
which simulates
an oncoming attack.

38:21.800 --> 38:27.339
I will then run the blade
across this and cut it.

38:27.373 --> 38:28.440
p first.
You ready?

38:28.474 --> 38:29.541
- Yes, sir.

38:29.575 --> 38:32.511
[dramatic music]

38:32.544 --> 38:39.485
*

38:43.855 --> 38:45.391
Yes.

38:45.424 --> 38:47.025
*

38:47.058 --> 38:49.861
- Oh, he died.
- Me like-a the feel.

38:49.895 --> 38:51.930
It feels good
in the hand.

38:51.963 --> 38:55.901
Enough to move and maneuver
in close-quarter combat--

38:55.934 --> 38:59.405
and overall,
your weapon will cut.

38:59.438 --> 39:00.706
- That's all I ever
wanted to hear.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.908
[laughter]

39:02.941 --> 39:04.376
- Ray, it's your turn.
You ready?

39:04.410 --> 39:05.744
- You betcha.
- Let's do this.

39:05.777 --> 39:06.978
- Let's do it.

39:07.012 --> 39:13.985
*

39:22.594 --> 39:24.930
- This is gonna be tough, Ray.
- I know it.

39:24.963 --> 39:26.565
- I like your blade too.

39:26.598 --> 39:29.568
Your panabas das dinitely
is a cutter,

39:29.601 --> 39:31.703
and it's easy to wield.

39:31.737 --> 39:34.072
Your panabas will cut.

39:34.105 --> 39:36.508
- Thank you, sir.
- Good job.

39:36.542 --> 39:40.078
- Heading into judging, I feel
really neck-and-neck with Ray,

39:40.111 --> 39:41.780
but I can see myself,

39:41.813 --> 39:44.149
like the end
of a John Hughes film,

39:44.182 --> 39:46.752
with that panabas
blade above my head.

39:46.785 --> 39:49.455
It's got to happen.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.022
- Josh, Ray, the judges

39:51.056 --> 39:53.992
have deliberated
the results of the tests,

39:54.025 --> 39:57.162
and they've made
a final decision.

39:57.195 --> 39:59.831
However, before I give you
that decision,

39:59.865 --> 40:02.534
they have some things they'd
like to say to both of you.

40:02.568 --> 40:04.903
- This is one of the
competitions that's so much fun,

40:04.936 --> 40:07.539
because it's obvious
why you guys are fan favorites.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.875
Your attitude,
your camaraderie right now

40:09.908 --> 40:11.042
is great to watch.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.178
With the tests being even,

40:13.211 --> 40:17.182
what it came down to was us
looking at your craftsmanship,

40:17.215 --> 40:19.851
the artistry of your blade.

40:19.885 --> 40:21.687
But there's no loser
between the two of you.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.021
These blades were fantastic.

40:23.054 --> 40:25.056
*

40:25.090 --> 40:28.159
- Josh and Ray, I honestly
hate that it's come to me

40:28.193 --> 40:30.529
to be the guy
that has to say these words,

40:30.562 --> 40:33.465
but there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" champion

40:33.499 --> 40:34.633
in this arena...

40:34.666 --> 40:37.803
*

40:37.836 --> 40:39.505
And that champion is...

40:39.538 --> 40:42.708
*

40:42.741 --> 40:45.477
Josh.

40:45.511 --> 40:48.680
Ray, unfortunately, your panabas
did not make the cut.

40:48.714 --> 40:50.782
Jason Knight will explain.

40:50.816 --> 40:53.118
- When it comes down
to this type of competition,

40:53.151 --> 40:54.920
sometimes,
just the little details

40:54.953 --> 40:56.922
are the game-changer, Ray.

40:56.955 --> 41:00.025
Josh had a little bit
more subtleties in his design.

41:00.058 --> 41:02.694
His handle was
octagonally faceted,

41:02.728 --> 41:05.196
and he had file work
in the spine,

41:05.230 --> 41:07.165
and those subtle details
are the reason

41:07.198 --> 41:09.568
why Josh's blade won.

41:09.601 --> 41:12.671
- Ray, please
surrender your weapon.

41:12.704 --> 41:15.607
- Buddy, give me a hug.
- You got it.

41:15.641 --> 41:17.008
Got to hug you.
- Aww.

41:17.042 --> 41:18.810
- Oh, I feel great.

41:18.844 --> 41:22.047
I came here
not to prove anything.

41:22.080 --> 41:25.551
I just enjoy the competition.

41:25.584 --> 41:27.853
My knife performed,
and his knife performed,

41:27.886 --> 41:30.055
so he got the money
and I got the fun.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.857
*

41:31.890 --> 41:33.559
- Josh, congratulations.

41:33.592 --> 41:35.126
You are
the "Forged in Fire" champion

41:35.160 --> 41:37.996
and will be receiving
a check for $10,000.

41:38.029 --> 41:39.665
You're super excited
right now, aren't you?

41:39.698 --> 41:44.202
- This is like--
it just feels so good.

41:44.235 --> 41:47.305
All of you fans,
wherever the hell you came from,

41:47.338 --> 41:49.107
I [bleep] love you guys.

41:49.140 --> 41:52.010
Josephine, with your designs
that helped me

41:52.043 --> 41:55.080
get through round two
with the handle, thank you.

41:55.113 --> 41:57.315
You made Daddy win.

41:57.348 --> 42:00.218
I am the
"Forged in Fire" champion!

42:00.251 --> 42:01.653
That's what the [bleep]
happened.

42:01.687 --> 42:02.654
Whoo!

42:02.688 --> 42:04.289
[bleep].

42:04.322 --> 42:05.256
Sorry, Aunt Edie.

42:05.290 --> 42:09.227
