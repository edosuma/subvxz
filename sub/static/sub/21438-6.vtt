WEBVTT

00:01.391 --> 00:03.358
Are you coming?

00:03.627 --> 00:05.762
We got a DNA match
on those bloodstains.

00:05.795 --> 00:07.464
Your girl Cora.

00:07.497 --> 00:09.533
She's all over that blanket.

00:09.566 --> 00:12.536
The questions surrounding
murder defendant Cora Tannetti

00:12.568 --> 00:14.137
have only intensified.

00:14.170 --> 00:16.740
Cora,
you can see how this doesn't look

00:16.773 --> 00:17.774
very good for you.

00:17.807 --> 00:19.476
I didn't kill anybody.

00:19.509 --> 00:22.512
Else. You didn't kill anybody else.

00:22.546 --> 00:25.615
I don't want to do this anymore.

00:25.649 --> 00:28.418
I need you to move out.

00:28.452 --> 00:30.987
My lawyer thinks I should take
the deal they're offering.

00:31.020 --> 00:33.189
No, don't make any moves right now.

00:33.222 --> 00:34.658
I might have a lead.

00:34.691 --> 00:36.726
What's this I hear about you

00:36.760 --> 00:39.529
poking around the Beverwyck?

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

02:49.926 --> 02:51.895
911, what is your emergency?

02:51.928 --> 02:53.296
Hi, I need help.

02:53.329 --> 02:55.765
Someone's been shot.

02:55.799 --> 02:58.802
4245 Harren Road.

03:03.740 --> 03:04.774
Sir?

03:04.808 --> 03:06.943
Are you still there?

03:40.844 --> 03:42.145
You know, I bought these things

03:42.178 --> 03:43.680
for us to go in the water with them.

03:43.713 --> 03:45.615
You...you do know that, right?

03:45.649 --> 03:46.950
Oh, yeah, this is...

03:46.983 --> 03:49.152
this is my kind of tubing right here.

03:50.854 --> 03:52.588
Mmm.

04:32.796 --> 04:34.964
Are you okay?

04:36.265 --> 04:38.668
More.

04:52.716 --> 04:56.652
Harry? Harry?

04:57.987 --> 04:59.055
Harry?

04:59.088 --> 05:00.857
Oh, God damn it.

05:00.890 --> 05:02.025
Harry!

05:02.058 --> 05:04.961
Harry!

05:08.064 --> 05:09.899
You're supposed to tell me to stop.

05:14.470 --> 05:15.772
I'm fine.

05:15.805 --> 05:18.074
Hey, it's nothing.

05:22.846 --> 05:23.980
What the hell is wrong with you?

05:24.013 --> 05:25.915
Nothing.

05:25.949 --> 05:27.250
'Cause what just happened,
you passing out like that?

05:27.283 --> 05:29.085
That's a whole different game.

05:33.957 --> 05:36.059
You could at least talk to me.

05:36.092 --> 05:39.062
This isn't just...

05:39.095 --> 05:41.998
you didn't always pay me, you know?

05:48.938 --> 05:50.106
Okay.

05:50.139 --> 05:51.908
Wait.

05:53.009 --> 05:54.744
I don't want to do this anymore.

05:54.778 --> 05:56.279
I'm serious.

05:56.312 --> 05:57.847
That's it.

05:57.881 --> 05:59.816
We're done.

06:06.856 --> 06:09.292
No, you should have taped off
the whole road,

06:09.325 --> 06:11.294
so start from the corner,

06:11.327 --> 06:12.862
and you got to tell the camera guys

06:12.896 --> 06:13.930
to park over at the gas station.

06:13.963 --> 06:15.765
Yep.
Okay?

06:15.799 --> 06:17.300
You look weary.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.335
There's coffee in the van.

06:19.368 --> 06:21.504
I told you not to bring them in.

06:21.537 --> 06:23.106
One day after you interview them,

06:23.139 --> 06:26.542
he gets shot at close range?

06:26.575 --> 06:29.178
Somebody's getting nervous
about Cora Tannetti.

06:32.081 --> 06:36.519
Like a spider in your brain,
that woman.

06:36.552 --> 06:39.755
And the worst part is, you feed it.

06:41.157 --> 06:43.026
Seriously.

06:43.059 --> 06:44.961
Get a cup of coffee, hmm?

06:48.031 --> 06:49.899
With your DNA on that blanket,

06:49.933 --> 06:52.969
they'll be gunning
for a second murder charge.

06:54.370 --> 06:56.239
You still have the DA's offer.

06:58.107 --> 07:00.844
I'm not confessing
to something I don't remember.

07:03.112 --> 07:07.016
Look, the DA's not working
with me without a confession,

07:07.050 --> 07:09.352
and unless we've got
some significant new evidence,

07:09.385 --> 07:13.022
we can't reverse your plea
and go to trial.

07:13.056 --> 07:14.123
I think we got to be realistic

07:14.157 --> 07:15.825
and work with what we got.

07:15.859 --> 07:17.927
I want to speak to Detective Ambrose.

07:19.195 --> 07:21.831
You really think he has
your best interests in mind?

07:22.966 --> 07:25.101
At least he's doing something.

07:26.169 --> 07:27.837
Cora, I want to help you,

07:27.871 --> 07:30.039
but there's only so much I can do.

07:31.074 --> 07:32.842
I don't know what his angle is,

07:32.876 --> 07:35.111
but I am trying to offer you
real options.

07:40.616 --> 07:43.186
Look, if you need anything...

07:43.219 --> 07:46.089
something to read,
somebody to talk to...

07:46.122 --> 07:47.823
call.

07:54.898 --> 07:57.967
We found a natural gas tank
with a security camera

07:58.001 --> 08:00.870
right down the block
from the victim's house.

08:00.904 --> 08:03.072
Mason Tannetti?

08:03.106 --> 08:05.208
An air conditioning service man
offs a guy

08:05.241 --> 08:09.946
because his wife dated him
before they got married?

08:11.280 --> 08:13.416
It doesn't add up.

08:13.449 --> 08:16.052
Maybe your math is better than mine.

08:21.257 --> 08:23.259
July 3, 2012.

08:23.292 --> 08:26.029
Cora goes out to meet JD Lambert,

08:26.062 --> 08:27.463
who she's seeing at the time,

08:27.496 --> 08:29.232
and she doesn't come home that night.

08:29.265 --> 08:31.634
In fact, she isn't seen again

08:31.667 --> 08:33.937
until two months later, September 5th,

08:33.970 --> 08:37.240
when she shows up at
the Riverside Wellness Clinic,

08:37.273 --> 08:39.442
and then working with a therapist

08:39.475 --> 08:41.277
in the medical unit.

08:41.309 --> 08:43.645
She remembers meeting a young woman,

08:43.679 --> 08:45.081
Madeline Beecham,

08:45.114 --> 08:47.984
JD's ex-girlfriend,

08:48.017 --> 08:50.153
and now she's been missing
for five years,

08:50.186 --> 08:54.924
and then Cora remembers
some landmarks in the woods,

08:54.958 --> 08:56.259
which leads us to a body

08:56.292 --> 08:58.194
that's found near the Beverwyck Club,

08:58.227 --> 09:00.997
a club that has a history
of sexual allegations

09:01.030 --> 09:03.066
and huge settlements.

09:03.099 --> 09:05.468
But whatever happened to her there,

09:05.501 --> 09:08.704
it's kept secret
by the Beverwyck lawyer,

09:08.737 --> 09:12.108
which is the same guy
that repped JD Lambert,

09:12.141 --> 09:14.210
and now, shortly after,

09:14.243 --> 09:17.180
JD Lambert is dead.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.916
That's the math on this.

09:25.254 --> 09:28.191
All I heard was...

09:28.224 --> 09:29.959
missing women,

09:29.993 --> 09:32.295
drug addicts, sexual allegation,

09:32.328 --> 09:34.998
and a private club.

09:38.067 --> 09:41.971
Nothing about the one question
that matters,

09:42.005 --> 09:44.240
which is why did Cora Tannetti

09:44.273 --> 09:46.976
kill Frankie Belmont?

10:11.601 --> 10:15.505
I wish I could just
live in your body for one night.

10:16.606 --> 10:19.343
Drive it all over town.

10:20.710 --> 10:22.912
I wish you could too, though I, uh...

10:22.946 --> 10:26.516
I don't think I would
make it back in one piece.

10:26.550 --> 10:29.953
But it would be a night to remember.

10:38.728 --> 10:41.365
Do you even want to go
to Florida anymore?

10:42.632 --> 10:44.501
Of course I do.

10:44.534 --> 10:46.703
You never talk about it.

10:46.736 --> 10:48.705
We're not saving any more money.

10:48.738 --> 10:50.574
I've just been busy.

10:52.742 --> 10:53.777
Yeah.

10:55.679 --> 10:59.949
With JD and his micro-penis.

10:59.983 --> 11:02.486
It's not micro.

11:02.519 --> 11:04.954
It's not like I would know.

11:04.988 --> 11:06.990
Well,
maybe I don't want to share every detail

11:07.023 --> 11:08.658
of my sex life.

11:11.495 --> 11:14.764
So you have a sex life now?

11:16.633 --> 11:18.802
My head's killing me.

11:21.805 --> 11:23.540
I don't have to go
if you don't want me to.

11:23.573 --> 11:26.510
I can stay.

11:26.543 --> 11:28.545
Yes.

11:30.747 --> 11:33.550
No.

11:37.821 --> 11:40.790
God, I hate Schubert.

12:03.713 --> 12:05.849
You like that?

12:08.585 --> 12:11.588
You want it?

12:11.621 --> 12:15.492
Yeah.

12:15.525 --> 12:17.461
Ohh.

12:18.828 --> 12:21.665
Don't stop.

12:21.698 --> 12:23.767
You have to ask for it.

12:26.870 --> 12:29.806
Please.

12:29.839 --> 12:32.776
Please, please.

12:44.621 --> 12:45.789
Where are my shoes?

12:45.822 --> 12:48.558
I swear I left them here last night.

12:50.860 --> 12:52.862
Maddie.

12:52.896 --> 12:55.632
What are you doing?

12:55.665 --> 12:57.066
I'm looking for my shoes.

12:57.100 --> 13:00.804
I can't exactly go home without them.

13:00.837 --> 13:02.639
Come here.

13:03.607 --> 13:04.941
Come here.

13:18.622 --> 13:20.790
I thought we talked about this.

13:22.659 --> 13:24.561
Jealousy keeps you from your potential.

13:24.594 --> 13:26.563
You're better than this.

13:27.597 --> 13:29.633
We're all in this together,

13:29.666 --> 13:31.568
right?

13:33.937 --> 13:35.939
And that's what you said.

13:37.907 --> 13:39.976
Right?

13:41.778 --> 13:43.647
Yeah.

13:47.617 --> 13:49.786
Can you give me and Cora a minute,
please?

14:03.967 --> 14:06.703
I saw two guys leaving
in a black Pontiac,

14:06.736 --> 14:08.805
and then I went inside.

14:08.838 --> 14:11.641
I found him dead there at the table saw.

14:11.675 --> 14:13.810
The machine was still going.

14:13.843 --> 14:17.847
You just...walked right in?

14:18.882 --> 14:21.885
I know that I shouldn't have, but...

14:23.587 --> 14:27.957
This guy attacked my father, so...

14:27.991 --> 14:29.793
You went for revenge.

14:29.826 --> 14:30.994
No.

14:31.027 --> 14:33.630
I just went there to tell him to...

14:33.663 --> 14:36.165
back off, and that's all.

14:36.199 --> 14:38.034
Were you armed?

14:44.874 --> 14:46.876
Yes.

14:56.052 --> 14:59.656
Harry, what are you doing?

14:59.689 --> 15:02.726
I'm fertilizing the dogwoods.

15:02.759 --> 15:05.662
It's raining.

15:05.695 --> 15:09.866
They needed it,
and nobody was getting to it, so...

15:09.899 --> 15:11.868
I'll be gone in five minutes.

15:11.901 --> 15:14.871
You can't just show up
whenever you want.

15:14.904 --> 15:19.008
I planted these trees.
I'm not gonna let them die.

15:19.042 --> 15:21.745
Then put 'em in your car
and take them.

15:21.778 --> 15:22.979
They're rooted already.

15:23.012 --> 15:24.648
They can't be moved.

15:24.681 --> 15:26.750
Well, then that's too bad.

15:28.251 --> 15:30.854
You decided to do this now.

15:30.887 --> 15:33.857
It's not their fault.

15:33.890 --> 15:36.125
So I'm fertilizing them.

15:38.728 --> 15:40.697
You need to leave.

15:40.730 --> 15:42.732
Right now.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.234
It's not fair.

15:45.268 --> 15:48.705
You don't get to just decide.

15:48.738 --> 15:50.640
I do.

15:50.674 --> 15:52.776
For the first time, I do.

15:54.944 --> 15:56.980
I've been trying.

15:58.047 --> 16:01.751
This whole time.

16:01.785 --> 16:04.253
You think I haven't been trying,

16:04.287 --> 16:06.923
but that's all I do.

16:09.793 --> 16:11.995
I'm always trying.

16:15.765 --> 16:17.801
I know.

16:18.968 --> 16:21.738
And I hope it gets easier for you.

16:22.972 --> 16:25.008
I really do.

17:02.346 --> 17:03.980
Yeah, they just left it here.

17:05.515 --> 17:07.483
Black Pontiac Grand Am, '04.

17:07.517 --> 17:09.319
Jersey plates.

17:09.353 --> 17:11.021
So we just got the car

17:11.055 --> 17:13.290
that Mason Tannetti saw
at the crime scene.

17:13.323 --> 17:15.625
Reported stolen last week in Trenton.

17:15.659 --> 17:18.494
Matches the tracks found
at the crime scene.

17:18.528 --> 17:20.396
Two passengers,

17:20.430 --> 17:22.232
probably oxy users,

17:22.266 --> 17:23.532
maybe dealers.

17:23.567 --> 17:25.635
Detective Leroy is gonna handle this.

17:25.669 --> 17:27.671
Looks like a local thing.

17:27.704 --> 17:30.307
Thanks.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.289
You saw JD lying there?

17:46.190 --> 17:47.992
Yeah.

17:51.128 --> 17:53.363
Do they know who did it?

17:54.198 --> 17:55.399
I mean,
the police are looking for 'em now.

17:55.432 --> 17:57.334
I don't know.

18:05.442 --> 18:08.078
I don't know what I was trying to do.

18:11.081 --> 18:14.184
But I think not knowing

18:14.218 --> 18:16.320
what was happening with you...

18:18.455 --> 18:21.291
Just made me want to fix it somehow.

18:21.325 --> 18:23.293
I don't know.

18:25.863 --> 18:29.133
I should never have lied to you.

18:29.166 --> 18:32.002
No, I mean...

18:32.036 --> 18:34.204
it was me too.

18:38.843 --> 18:41.245
For a long time...

18:44.214 --> 18:47.117
I felt like something was wrong.

18:48.452 --> 18:50.387
I was afraid to...

18:50.420 --> 18:53.157
to find out the answer.

18:57.127 --> 19:00.364
It wasn't just you.

19:06.236 --> 19:08.238
Were you ever really happy?

19:10.440 --> 19:12.376
With me?

19:15.279 --> 19:17.347
Yes.

19:17.381 --> 19:19.416
I was.

19:24.221 --> 19:26.223
I don't know what to do.

19:41.338 --> 19:43.140
Hello.

19:43.173 --> 19:46.210
You have to get me out of here.

19:46.243 --> 19:48.212
We really shouldn't be talking.

19:48.245 --> 19:50.147
Take me to where
you think it happened...

19:50.180 --> 19:52.249
the club, the basement.

19:52.282 --> 19:54.218
Maybe if I could just go,

19:54.251 --> 19:56.386
then I can remember the rest.

19:56.420 --> 19:59.256
It's a state police matter now,

19:59.289 --> 20:01.358
so they won't let me take you out.

20:01.391 --> 20:03.193
Why not?

20:05.930 --> 20:09.233
Because they think I'm getting
too close to you.

20:11.936 --> 20:13.470
You've given up.

20:15.405 --> 20:17.341
No, I haven't.

20:17.374 --> 20:19.409
I can hear it in your voice.

20:19.443 --> 20:22.212
Just...

20:22.246 --> 20:23.914
I hit a wall, is all.

20:23.948 --> 20:26.383
With the case or with yourself?

20:31.288 --> 20:33.157
Harry...

20:34.224 --> 20:36.293
You have done more for me
than anyone I know,

20:36.326 --> 20:38.562
and you are all I've got.

20:40.297 --> 20:42.132
Please.

20:45.735 --> 20:47.571
Just leave me alone.
Honey, please.

20:47.604 --> 20:48.872
You're just making it worse.

20:48.905 --> 20:50.707
We'll pray together.
Get out.

20:50.740 --> 20:52.876
Get out of my-just leave me alone!

20:55.512 --> 20:57.714
What's going on?

20:57.747 --> 20:59.616
She passed out this morning.

20:59.649 --> 21:04.654
The doctor says her T cell count
is elevated.

21:04.688 --> 21:06.490
It can't end like this.

21:07.857 --> 21:09.693
It just can't.

21:52.704 --> 21:55.105
She's got some idea that by going back

21:55.240 --> 21:57.075
to the scene of the crime,

21:57.108 --> 21:59.077
she's gonna get some kind of release,

21:59.110 --> 22:01.146
a catharsis.

22:02.513 --> 22:06.417
Is this some weird game
you two are playing?

22:06.451 --> 22:09.587
Look, I think if I took her
back to the Beverwyck,

22:09.620 --> 22:11.456
she'll tell me what she did.

22:15.260 --> 22:17.996
You have to convince Judge Baird.

22:18.029 --> 22:19.564
No.

22:19.597 --> 22:22.200
Come on. I got work to do.

22:22.233 --> 22:24.002
Oh, I really hate to do this,

22:24.035 --> 22:27.238
but I remember back in my patrol days

22:27.272 --> 22:31.877
when I pulled over a young
assistant district attorney

22:31.910 --> 22:34.980
with at least half a drink
too many in her.

22:35.013 --> 22:38.049
Are you really gonna play that
for this?

22:38.083 --> 22:39.584
Yeah.

22:50.896 --> 22:52.563
Sorry.

22:54.532 --> 22:57.135
You can't get through an hour
without checking in with her.

23:00.505 --> 23:01.973
Do you realize that?

23:08.947 --> 23:11.082
She depends on me.

23:12.083 --> 23:13.919
Cora,
if Phoebe really cared about you,

23:13.952 --> 23:15.553
she'd let you go.

23:17.055 --> 23:19.624
She'd tell you to go live your life.

23:21.559 --> 23:23.962
Has she ever said anything like that?

23:28.934 --> 23:30.601
You know why?

23:31.970 --> 23:34.605
She wants your life for herself.

23:35.640 --> 23:37.108
She's a vampire,

23:37.142 --> 23:41.079
and as long as you stay with her,

23:41.112 --> 23:43.081
you'll be a shell.

23:56.694 --> 23:58.663
This Saturday,

23:58.696 --> 24:01.933
tell Phoebe and your parents
you're going out.

24:01.967 --> 24:05.070
Pack a change of clothes in your purse,

24:05.103 --> 24:08.006
meet me at the Taproom.

24:08.039 --> 24:10.108
When we're done celebrating,

24:10.141 --> 24:12.110
just come home with me.

24:13.344 --> 24:15.146
You don't go back.

24:20.685 --> 24:22.553
Give me the phone.

24:40.038 --> 24:42.373
No touching the inmate
unless she needs to be subdued,

24:42.407 --> 24:43.708
recovered, or medically revived.

24:43.741 --> 24:45.143
Understand?
Yes.

24:45.176 --> 24:46.644
No unscheduled stops.

24:46.677 --> 24:48.613
Fast food, casinos,

24:48.646 --> 24:50.381
movie theaters, motels.

24:50.415 --> 24:52.050
Got it.

24:52.083 --> 24:54.185
Judge Baird has given you two hours.

24:54.219 --> 24:56.354
If you are not back
in the allotted time,

24:56.387 --> 24:58.123
we automatically issue a warrant

24:58.156 --> 24:59.724
for both of you.

24:59.757 --> 25:01.626
You have a Taser?

25:01.659 --> 25:03.028
No.

25:03.061 --> 25:05.396
You want a Taser?

25:05.430 --> 25:08.066
No.
Suit yourself.

25:08.099 --> 25:11.002
Two hours. See you at 6:00.

25:18.043 --> 25:21.046
Uh, let me get this...

25:23.414 --> 25:25.216
Is that all right?

25:27.085 --> 25:29.120
Um...

25:30.121 --> 25:33.691
You want your hands outside?
Mm-hmm.

25:33.724 --> 25:35.060
How's that?

25:35.093 --> 25:37.128
Good.
Good.

25:46.637 --> 25:48.206
Did you move?

25:48.239 --> 25:50.075
Yeah, kind of.

25:55.713 --> 25:58.649
So once we get to the club,

25:58.683 --> 26:02.220
we only got a half hour,
and then we got to head back.

26:02.253 --> 26:04.122
That's all we got.

26:07.658 --> 26:10.027
What if I don't remember anything?

26:11.262 --> 26:13.064
Yeah...

26:54.872 --> 26:56.307
Cora.

27:01.247 --> 27:02.181
Ms. Grayston, I know that...
It has all been

27:03.950 --> 27:05.117
arranged by the board.

27:05.151 --> 27:07.053
We are an open book to you, Detective.

27:07.086 --> 27:08.120
Oh, really?

27:08.154 --> 27:10.122
Well, I appreciate that.

27:10.156 --> 27:12.291
Be sure to thank the board for me.

27:21.033 --> 27:23.035
I've been here before.

27:43.722 --> 27:46.692
Yeah, this is it.

27:46.725 --> 27:48.694
We need to do this part on our own.

27:48.727 --> 27:51.163
Thank you.

27:51.197 --> 27:53.199
Of course.

28:14.386 --> 28:16.288
You ready?

29:30.296 --> 29:32.131
Are you all right?

29:34.200 --> 29:35.634
This isn't the place.

29:38.170 --> 29:39.505
This is the basement.

29:46.345 --> 29:48.414
You're not getting anything?

29:49.448 --> 29:51.250
No.

29:51.283 --> 29:54.220
I'm trying,
but I just can't make it happen.

30:14.506 --> 30:16.242
I'm sorry.

30:26.252 --> 30:28.354
You could've called.

30:31.257 --> 30:32.658
I lost track of time.

30:32.691 --> 30:34.426
Sorry.

30:36.295 --> 30:38.297
You're gonna leave me.

30:39.365 --> 30:40.499
Stop.

30:43.702 --> 30:46.138
You're in love.

30:50.242 --> 30:52.110
It doesn't matter.

30:53.279 --> 30:55.281
It'll be easier when I'm gone.

30:56.348 --> 30:57.383
Don't say that.

30:57.416 --> 30:58.884
You're not going anywhere,

30:58.917 --> 31:01.119
and neither am I.

31:15.401 --> 31:17.169
Shh.

31:17.203 --> 31:21.240
Come on.

31:31.317 --> 31:33.919
Tell me what he does to you
when you're alone.

31:33.952 --> 31:37.189
No.

31:37.223 --> 31:38.590
Cora.

31:43.295 --> 31:44.496
We touch.

31:44.530 --> 31:47.399
Great. You touch.

31:47.433 --> 31:51.303
There's...

31:51.337 --> 31:53.505
there's...I don't know.

31:53.539 --> 31:55.374
Rubbing.

31:56.575 --> 32:00.178
Where?
The usual places.

32:04.283 --> 32:05.584
Show me.

32:09.588 --> 32:12.524
Show me how he kisses you at least.

32:15.594 --> 32:17.429
Cora.

32:46.024 --> 32:48.327
Where does he touch you?

32:54.032 --> 32:56.234
Please.

33:14.386 --> 33:16.288
What does he say?

33:24.496 --> 33:27.499
He says, "Do you want it?"

34:06.137 --> 34:08.440
Can you turn right up here?

34:09.375 --> 34:11.543
Uh, we don't have the time, Cora.

34:12.578 --> 34:14.780
Just a minute?

34:27.458 --> 34:29.327
They're not home.

34:30.596 --> 34:32.563
Me and my sister's room is right there,

34:32.598 --> 34:34.331
in the front.

34:35.634 --> 34:37.703
We made a lot of plans in that room.

34:42.507 --> 34:44.109
Gonna move to Naples, Florida.

34:44.141 --> 34:46.411
Mapped it all out.

34:48.746 --> 34:52.751
I was in Cape Coral once.

34:54.652 --> 34:58.690
I remember the air there.

34:58.724 --> 35:01.359
It was thick.

35:02.528 --> 35:04.563
It felt like silk.

35:06.598 --> 35:08.800
I wish I was there now.

35:13.505 --> 35:15.474
Me too.

35:17.175 --> 35:19.745
We could go.

35:26.652 --> 35:28.820
Did your wife ask you to move out?

35:34.460 --> 35:36.562
Yeah.

35:37.629 --> 35:39.965
Why?

35:39.998 --> 35:42.734
Uh...

35:42.768 --> 35:47.439
I'm just, uh...

35:47.473 --> 35:48.507
I'm not easy.

35:48.540 --> 35:50.709
I'm not good at, uh...

35:53.011 --> 35:55.814
Talking.

36:00.686 --> 36:02.554
Me neither.

36:05.557 --> 36:10.562
Everyone assumes we start out
in the same place.

36:14.032 --> 36:15.701
We don't.

36:59.077 --> 37:01.847
Take me back to the club.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.248
We can't. We're late already.

37:03.281 --> 37:04.616
Come on.
I can't go back there.

37:04.650 --> 37:06.952
I can't...not shut in like that.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.489
Maybe we missed something.

37:16.628 --> 37:18.764
You think we did?

37:18.797 --> 37:21.767
I don't know...

37:21.800 --> 37:23.802
but I have to try.

37:23.835 --> 37:25.604
Please.

37:31.744 --> 37:31.944
Hey.

37:34.313 --> 37:37.584
This is gonna make this easier.

37:39.719 --> 37:41.654
Okay, turn.

37:44.857 --> 37:46.025
Thank you.

37:47.359 --> 37:48.861
Oh, shit.

37:48.895 --> 37:50.797
I've been expecting...

37:52.632 --> 37:53.833
I got to take this.

37:53.866 --> 37:56.569
Don't go far.
Okay.

37:57.870 --> 38:00.306
Yeah.
Detective Ambrose.

38:00.339 --> 38:03.242
It's Dean from
the medical examiner's office.

38:03.275 --> 38:05.612
Uh-huh. What do you got?

38:12.785 --> 38:14.687
Hello?

38:16.322 --> 38:18.290
Is the detective with you?

38:20.660 --> 38:21.894
He's coming.

38:30.102 --> 38:32.672
Okay.

38:32.705 --> 38:34.607
Look, I got to go.

38:43.115 --> 38:45.317
She went through the library.

38:57.897 --> 38:59.932
Cora?

39:19.786 --> 39:21.788
Cora!

39:23.823 --> 39:25.892
Cora!

39:51.984 --> 39:54.020
That's it.

39:56.923 --> 39:59.826
It happened down there.

40:10.202 --> 40:13.172
I feel sick.

40:18.510 --> 40:21.981
Cora, you don't have to do this.

40:22.014 --> 40:23.983
It's up to you.

41:13.099 --> 41:14.934
I remember now.
