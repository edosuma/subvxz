WEBVTT

00:03.303 --> 00:04.705
Good morning, ladies.

00:04.771 --> 00:06.306
Oh, look, my coffeemaker's
on the fritz.

00:06.372 --> 00:07.641
Can I borrow a cup?

00:07.708 --> 00:09.275
Hot cup of Joe
comin' right up.

00:09.342 --> 00:10.276
Alright.

00:16.315 --> 00:17.618
That's about right.

00:18.652 --> 00:19.920
You like cream?

00:21.522 --> 00:24.057
What do you know.
I can measure every sip, huh?

00:24.625 --> 00:25.726
Good morning.

00:26.993 --> 00:28.895
Hey, there.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.431
Well, what is all
these dishes?

00:31.497 --> 00:33.800
Who is tryin' to grow
Penicillin in my sink?

00:35.135 --> 00:36.503
Don't look at me,
it's Synclaire's turn

00:36.570 --> 00:37.504
to do the dishes.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.773
Nah‐huh.
It's Khadijah's turn.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.976
I traded two do‐the‐dishes
for one clean‐the‐bathroom.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.277
Thank you.

00:44.344 --> 00:45.546
Then why does the bathroom
look like

00:45.612 --> 00:46.880
it belongs in a bus station?

00:46.947 --> 00:48.414
[Kyle laughing]

00:48.481 --> 00:51.417
Maybe because you were supposed
to go buy cleanin' supplies

00:51.484 --> 00:52.819
and all you came back with

00:52.886 --> 00:55.622
was some nail polish
and a copy of "Blackhair Today."

00:56.757 --> 00:58.091
I can't believe this.

00:58.158 --> 01:01.334
We're all too busy
or too bougie

01:01.401 --> 01:03.269
to clean our own house.

01:03.336 --> 01:05.972
Hey, man, how you guys
keep your house so clean?

01:06.039 --> 01:07.040
Well, first of all

01:07.107 --> 01:08.575
we don't let you all
come visit.

01:10.744 --> 01:13.246
And second, you know, I shower
at the gym, I dine out

01:13.313 --> 01:15.215
and when my dates go well

01:15.281 --> 01:17.317
I can usually cajole them
into vacuuming

01:17.383 --> 01:18.451
on their way out
in the morning.

01:18.519 --> 01:19.452
Bye‐bye.

01:21.555 --> 01:24.190
Ladies, the time
has come for us

01:24.257 --> 01:26.326
to hire a maid.

01:26.392 --> 01:28.862
What? I don't want
some old feisty woman

01:28.929 --> 01:30.396
messin' with my stuff.

01:30.463 --> 01:33.199
We're not the Jeffersons.

01:33.266 --> 01:34.968
(as George)
Well, hold on there, Weezy.

01:37.538 --> 01:39.506
We could get somebody
who could cook, too!

01:39.573 --> 01:42.208
Imagine coming home
to a big old platter

01:42.275 --> 01:45.579
of hot sloppy joes
on buttered buns.

01:45.646 --> 01:46.580
Mmm.

01:47.948 --> 01:49.449
Wait, with melted cheese on top?

01:49.516 --> 01:51.718
Wisconsin's finest.

01:51.785 --> 01:52.753
I'll get the phonebook.

01:52.819 --> 01:53.854

Okay, now,
I loosened the band

02:29.830 --> 02:32.599
so, you can get
your big head in this.

02:32.666 --> 02:34.901
‐ Okay, how does that feel?
‐ Well, it's okay.

02:34.968 --> 02:37.738
But it tickles my nose
every time I inhale.

02:37.804 --> 02:40.140
Well, honey, a good bride
never breathes.

02:40.206 --> 02:41.307
[inhales deeply]

02:43.844 --> 02:46.680
Obie! It's bad luck.
Don't look at me.

02:48.048 --> 02:49.449
It only applies
to your weddin' dress

02:49.516 --> 02:51.451
not your weddin' drawers.

02:52.553 --> 02:55.088
You look beautiful,
my‐bride‐in‐bloomers.

02:56.456 --> 02:58.592
Hey, that's
a nice veil, Regine.

02:58.659 --> 03:01.301
Wrap that lace
around a muzzle

03:01.367 --> 03:03.504
be perfect
for your weddin'.

03:03.570 --> 03:05.839
At least I'll have
a wedding, Marmaduke.

03:07.641 --> 03:08.909
Good news, baby.

03:08.975 --> 03:11.612
Max's landlord is lookin'
for a new handyman

03:11.678 --> 03:13.113
and thanks to her
recommendation

03:13.179 --> 03:14.681
he hired me on the spot.

03:14.748 --> 03:16.550
I told him
Overton works cheap

03:16.617 --> 03:19.219
doesn't flash people,
and never has been hospitalized

03:19.285 --> 03:20.386
for schizophrenia.

03:21.788 --> 03:23.256
Are you sure you can
live up to all of that?

03:23.323 --> 03:25.592
Yup, and with marriage
and the prospect

03:25.659 --> 03:27.127
of little James‐Joneses

03:27.193 --> 03:29.495
I figured this would be a good
time to build a nest egg.

03:29.563 --> 03:32.465
Oh, Overton, you don't have
to work two jobs.

03:32.533 --> 03:34.701
If we plan ahead
for hard times

03:34.768 --> 03:36.036
we'll be just fine.

03:36.102 --> 03:38.839
Yeah, and if "If" was a fifth

03:38.905 --> 03:40.306
we'd all be drunk.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.348
Synclaire,
why are you cleanin'

03:48.414 --> 03:50.551
when the housekeeper
will be here any minute?

03:50.617 --> 03:52.686
I am not about to let
a complete stranger

03:52.753 --> 03:55.355
see how we keep house.

03:55.421 --> 03:57.658
When maids aren't
scrubbing toilets

03:57.724 --> 03:58.825
they talk.

04:00.694 --> 04:03.870
Well, I say we trash the place
and get our money's worth.

04:03.937 --> 04:04.971
There, let her have that.

04:05.038 --> 04:07.173
Oh, what are you doing?

04:07.240 --> 04:09.676
Oh, it's not a "Her,"
it's a "Him."

04:09.743 --> 04:11.512
What?

04:11.578 --> 04:13.246
Oh, great.

04:13.313 --> 04:14.748
He shrinks my bras
in the dryer

04:14.815 --> 04:16.750
I'll have
to give them to Max.

04:19.119 --> 04:20.921
[knock on door]

04:20.987 --> 04:24.424
Khadijah, it is tres chic
to have a man Friday.

04:24.490 --> 04:26.026
That way,
your apartment is clean

04:26.092 --> 04:28.028
for your man on Saturday.

04:31.131 --> 04:32.232
Good day.

04:38.304 --> 04:41.675
I'm Reese. I believe
you were expecting me.

04:41.742 --> 04:44.010
Good day.
I'm Regine.

04:44.077 --> 04:45.746
I'm the lady of the house.

04:45.812 --> 04:48.314
Oh, uh, Khadijah and Synclaire
live here, too.

04:50.383 --> 04:53.086
Hey, uh, do you make
Sloppy Joes?

04:53.153 --> 04:56.156
Actually, I prepare
a variation I like to call

04:56.222 --> 04:57.490
Tidy Josephs.

05:01.434 --> 05:04.137
You know, I used to not like
sweets in the morning

05:04.204 --> 05:06.239
but, uh,
you're changin' my mind.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.176
Just call me boy candy.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.278
Alright, you got it.

05:12.345 --> 05:13.614
[knocking on door]

05:13.680 --> 05:14.615
Oh, come on.

05:14.681 --> 05:15.616
(Overton)
'Ms. Shaw'

05:15.682 --> 05:16.883
'it's your handyman.'

05:16.950 --> 05:18.519
'Ha‐ha‐ha.'

05:18.585 --> 05:19.886
[laughing]

05:20.721 --> 05:21.655
Oh.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.027
What are you doin' here
so early?

05:27.093 --> 05:29.563
I got a six‐page
list of things to do.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.131
How come you didn't tell me
this place was a house

05:31.197 --> 05:32.633
of handyman horrors?

05:33.900 --> 05:36.102
I told you
my landlord was cheap.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.606
When my radiator broke
he gave me a hot‐water bottle.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.607
[knocking]

05:45.078 --> 05:48.214
‐ Hello, Shaw.
‐ Good morning, Mr. Leon.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.215
Slumlord.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.587
Oh, hey, Mr. Leon.
What's up, man?

05:53.654 --> 05:55.889
This building is crumbling
all around us

05:55.956 --> 05:57.323
that's what's up.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.926
3C has no electricity.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.468
1A can't get a picture
on his TV

06:02.536 --> 06:06.172
and 3A isn't getting
any hot water.

06:06.239 --> 06:07.941
Them damn people
take a shower every day.

06:08.008 --> 06:08.942
'Hm.'

06:10.443 --> 06:11.945
I'll tell you what

06:12.012 --> 06:14.915
I'm on it like trouble
on a Dallas Cowboy.

06:35.536 --> 06:37.771
‐ Oh, hey, hey, Kyle.
‐ Hey, Overton.

06:37.838 --> 06:39.272
How you doin', bro?

06:41.708 --> 06:42.909
Wha..

06:42.976 --> 06:44.578
What the devil.

06:44.645 --> 06:46.079
What happened?

06:46.947 --> 06:49.115
Order and cleanliness.

06:49.182 --> 06:50.817
No!

06:52.285 --> 06:54.955
I had a pencil
on each one of these piles.

06:55.021 --> 06:57.023
Straight up and down
means it's finished.

06:57.090 --> 06:58.992
Diagonal means
I have to reread it.

06:59.059 --> 07:00.761
And two pencils means

07:00.827 --> 07:03.670
fire the person
who gave me this trash!

07:03.737 --> 07:05.105
Forgive me.

07:05.171 --> 07:07.073
Next time I won't put
the pencils in the cup

07:07.140 --> 07:08.809
after I've sharpened them.

07:08.875 --> 07:11.578
Oh, no, you didn't.

07:12.913 --> 07:15.148
Don't you know it's bad luck
to sharpen a pencil

07:15.215 --> 07:17.017
before I finish
proofin' it?

07:18.084 --> 07:20.521
Look at this..

07:20.587 --> 07:23.590
...not one dull point
in the whole bunch.

07:24.858 --> 07:27.227
Why don't you just
push me out a window?

07:30.531 --> 07:33.900
Attention, the mailbox is now
off limits for about an hour.

07:33.967 --> 07:35.702
It's full of bleach.

07:35.769 --> 07:38.905
Nothin' like comin' home
to clean mail.

07:38.972 --> 07:41.374
Yep. Well, I'm off
to scrub out the air ducts

07:41.441 --> 07:43.176
and fill them
with dried apricots.

07:43.243 --> 07:45.011
I see.

07:45.078 --> 07:47.213
So, the next time
you turn on the furnace

07:47.280 --> 07:50.350
this apartment will smell
like mom's hot cobbler.

07:51.618 --> 07:54.187
You've dabbled in this
profession, haven't you?

07:56.122 --> 07:58.258
Well, I'm no Jeffery, but..

08:02.536 --> 08:04.470
...let's just say
I've got skills.

08:06.607 --> 08:07.541
‐ Hey, Max.
‐ 'Yeah.'

08:07.608 --> 08:08.942
Are you familiar
with the phrase

08:09.009 --> 08:11.444
"The building is only as strong
as its weakest apartment?"

08:11.512 --> 08:12.713
Are you familiar
with the phrase

08:12.779 --> 08:15.048
"Who gives
a rat's butt?"

08:15.115 --> 08:18.484
Well, I traced the source
of all this building's problems

08:18.552 --> 08:20.486
to this particular apartment.

08:20.554 --> 08:24.558
Your turbo showerhead decreases
other tenants water pressure

08:24.625 --> 08:26.727
and the constant
power outages are caused

08:26.793 --> 08:30.063
by your three heavy‐duty
microwaves.

08:30.130 --> 08:33.265
Yeah. I can pop popcorn,
nuke three TV dinners

08:33.332 --> 08:35.235
and zap a box
of hot pockets

08:35.301 --> 08:37.236
all at the same time.

08:38.739 --> 08:40.006
Okay, alright.

08:40.073 --> 08:41.775
Hey, well,
maybe I am

08:41.842 --> 08:44.144
a little bit
of an energy pirate.

08:44.210 --> 08:47.147
You're not gonna
drop a dime on me, are you?

08:48.549 --> 08:51.117
Nah, I just change your fuse
to the circuit breaker

08:51.184 --> 08:53.019
that will reduce
your amperage overload

08:53.086 --> 08:55.288
and put a flow restrictor
in your showerhead

08:55.355 --> 08:56.790
you know, on the down low.

08:56.857 --> 08:57.791
Alright.

08:57.858 --> 08:58.792
[laughs]

08:58.859 --> 09:00.333
[beeping]

09:00.400 --> 09:01.502
Oh, man.

09:02.402 --> 09:04.437
Oh, man. Ms. Royster.

09:04.505 --> 09:06.540
Probably got
bad TV reception again.

09:06.607 --> 09:08.441
If that lady
can't see "Judge Judy"

09:08.509 --> 09:10.443
she blows a gasket.

09:13.814 --> 09:14.848
Oh

09:14.915 --> 09:18.284
Jamaican number nine incense.

09:18.351 --> 09:20.453
Mmm. Thought Kyle was
the only one

09:20.521 --> 09:22.155
into this stuff.

09:22.222 --> 09:24.525
[sniffs]
Who turned you onto it?

09:24.591 --> 09:26.793
Now, did I ask you
any questions

09:26.860 --> 09:28.361
when I caught you
and Synclaire filling

09:28.428 --> 09:30.697
your caulking gun
with hot caramel?

09:33.567 --> 09:34.500
Good point.

09:36.770 --> 09:38.338
Hey, uh, Overton

09:38.404 --> 09:40.974
I'm headed down
to Grovetta's Fish Cottage.

09:41.041 --> 09:44.778
Uh, can I, uh, pick you up
a little some‐something?

09:44.845 --> 09:47.514
Aw, that's, uh, mighty generous
of you, Mr. Leon.

09:47.581 --> 09:49.850
Well, it's
two‐for‐one Tuesday.

09:49.916 --> 09:52.686
And if you give me
$2.79 for your lunch

09:52.753 --> 09:54.020
then mine's free.

09:56.122 --> 09:58.124
Uh‐huh.
Well, uh, anyway

09:58.191 --> 10:01.101
I pinpointed
your, um, reception trouble.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.870
‐ Satellite dish.
‐ What satellite dish?

10:03.937 --> 10:06.106
That one right there.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.141
What the hell is this?

10:08.208 --> 10:10.544
Hell, I didn't approve
no damn satellite dish!

10:10.611 --> 10:12.979
Oh, so we got a bit
of tomfoolery, huh?

10:13.046 --> 10:15.481
Now, well, we don't know
who did it yet

10:15.549 --> 10:18.018
but when I do find out

10:18.084 --> 10:19.653
they gonna be out of here

10:19.720 --> 10:22.455
faster than that fat gal
at the citadel.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.025
Now..

10:25.091 --> 10:26.560
Now, the cable leads down

10:26.627 --> 10:29.630
to Mrs. Moreno's apartment.

10:29.696 --> 10:32.933
Now, what does a old,
deaf, and blind woman

10:32.999 --> 10:34.735
need with a satellite dish?

10:34.801 --> 10:36.903
Yeah, but see,
if you look a little closer

10:36.970 --> 10:39.172
you'll see
that the crafty culprit

10:39.239 --> 10:42.609
rerouted the wire
down that drainpipe

10:42.676 --> 10:43.877
straight across

10:43.944 --> 10:47.514
till Max..

10:47.581 --> 10:49.249
Well, how's coffee?

10:49.315 --> 10:51.151
Man, I had a hankerin'
for some all day.

10:51.217 --> 10:52.586
When you go down
to Grovetta's Fish Cottage

10:52.653 --> 10:53.587
why don't you pick me up some?

10:53.654 --> 10:55.488
Wouldn't you know it?

10:55.556 --> 10:58.424
The cable leads straight
to Shaw's apartment!

10:58.491 --> 11:00.861
Oh, man. It might not
even be a satellite dish.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.103
Might be one of those
remote control bird baths.

11:03.169 --> 11:05.005
Put it here, fill it up
with water, the birds'll

11:05.071 --> 11:07.574
chirp, chirp..

11:07.641 --> 11:11.512
Overton, in one minute

11:11.578 --> 11:14.280
HBO is gonna stand for

11:14.347 --> 11:15.616
"Her Butt's Out."

11:17.117 --> 11:18.051
Mr. Leon..

11:18.118 --> 11:19.786
[knock on door]
'Open up, Shaw.'

11:19.853 --> 11:20.787
Damn!

11:20.854 --> 11:22.856
Goddam. Get off me.

11:22.923 --> 11:24.190
What the hell.

11:25.125 --> 11:27.360
[knocking continues]

11:27.427 --> 11:30.731
‐ What the hell do you want?
‐ You want to know what I want?

11:30.797 --> 11:33.199
Oh, I'll show you
what I want.

11:35.669 --> 11:36.970
I want

11:37.037 --> 11:39.940
your TV‐piratin' ass

11:40.006 --> 11:41.575
out of my buildin'!

11:42.943 --> 11:44.878
Where did that come from?

11:46.412 --> 11:49.182
Overton, tell this man
I'm innocent.

11:49.249 --> 11:52.485
Overton's the one
who blew the whistle on you.

11:52.553 --> 11:56.289
I still think we should
question the blind lady.

11:56.356 --> 11:59.626
Shaw, you are in violation

11:59.693 --> 12:02.636
of your tenant's agreement.

12:02.703 --> 12:06.472
And I don't like
your attitude.

12:06.540 --> 12:08.709
You got one week

12:08.775 --> 12:11.244
to pack your crap
and get out.

12:13.714 --> 12:15.281
Listen, I..

12:15.348 --> 12:16.983
‐ Good work, Overton.
‐ Oh.

12:23.056 --> 12:26.960
What in the hell
were you thinking, man?

12:28.161 --> 12:29.930
Look, I just saw
a dish up there.

12:29.996 --> 12:32.533
‐ I didn't know it was yours.
‐ Why not?

12:32.599 --> 12:35.168
You know me.

12:35.235 --> 12:38.238
I mean, where am I supposed
to live now!

12:38.304 --> 12:39.940
Damn!

12:40.006 --> 12:41.074
Well, you could, uh, crash

12:41.141 --> 12:42.709
with me and Kyle
for a little while.

12:42.776 --> 12:44.778
I'd rather stick
a chopstick up my nose

12:44.845 --> 12:45.912
and scramble my brain.

12:45.979 --> 12:47.247
Damn!

12:47.313 --> 12:49.049
I can't believe
you got me evicted

12:49.115 --> 12:51.585
after I pulled all those
strings to get you this job!

12:51.652 --> 12:54.988
Uh, now, hold up there,
Geppetto.

12:55.055 --> 12:57.624
It ain't like you're completely
innocent around here.

12:57.691 --> 12:59.059
You know, you're really
the Boy Scout.

12:59.125 --> 13:00.260
You'd rather
sell out a friend

13:00.326 --> 13:02.636
than ignore a little
creative wiring.

13:02.703 --> 13:04.838
You a fine one
to talk about friends

13:04.905 --> 13:06.272
borrowing things,
never return 'em.

13:06.339 --> 13:07.641
Eatin' up
other people's food

13:07.708 --> 13:09.843
and when you do get caught
with your hand in the cookie jar

13:09.910 --> 13:12.713
you blame the chef
for makin' 'em, oh, so tasty.

13:14.280 --> 13:18.051
What relative did you
get that colorful phrase from?

13:18.118 --> 13:20.186
Uncle Smoke Eye?

13:20.253 --> 13:21.187
'Cousin Hambone?'

13:21.254 --> 13:23.957
Grandpa Cotton Gin?

13:24.024 --> 13:25.859
Actually that was
one of my own.

13:25.926 --> 13:27.828
And here's another
pearl of wisdom.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.564
Your self‐centered chickens
have come home to roost

13:30.631 --> 13:32.633
so, cock‐a‐doodle‐do, girlie.

13:35.636 --> 13:37.871
Damn! I'm gonna go
get some air.

13:39.239 --> 13:40.741
Kyle Barker,
get out here right now

13:40.807 --> 13:43.409
'cause your woman
really startin' to piss me off.

13:46.613 --> 13:48.615
Oh, Overton, you know,
I could see Max

13:48.682 --> 13:50.250
from our apartment, man,
so, I came over to, you know

13:50.316 --> 13:52.285
just pull down her shades
a litlte.

13:52.352 --> 13:54.855
Cut the bull, shorty.
I know you and Max havin' sex.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.222
Your secret is
safe with me.

13:56.289 --> 13:57.791
Man, it's just sex,
that's all it is.

13:57.858 --> 13:59.593
You know, it's not like
the last time, you know?

13:59.660 --> 14:01.001
Well, I hope
it's good sex for you

14:01.067 --> 14:03.003
to deal with a woman
like that.

14:06.940 --> 14:08.174
Hoo.

14:09.976 --> 14:11.945
‐ It is. Mm‐hmm.
‐ Okay.

14:12.012 --> 14:13.814
Well, how come you ain't
tell me about it then?

14:13.880 --> 14:16.282
Because I was afraid you'd say
what you just said, man.

14:16.349 --> 14:18.184
Oh, no, I'm just
getting started.

14:18.251 --> 14:20.320
That got to be the most
stubborn, hard‐headed woman

14:20.386 --> 14:22.088
I ever met in my life.

14:22.155 --> 14:23.590
Yeah, well, I concur.

14:23.657 --> 14:25.692
She's greedy
and she's selfish.

14:25.759 --> 14:27.193
True that.
True that.

14:28.428 --> 14:31.932
‐ Plus she owe me five dollars.
‐ She owe me 30.

14:31.998 --> 14:33.133
Wait a minute.
Now, one of us

14:33.199 --> 14:35.135
is supposed to be
on the other side, right?

14:36.302 --> 14:38.839
Brother, we are talking
about Maxine here.

14:39.940 --> 14:41.875
‐ True that.
‐ Come on.

14:43.409 --> 14:46.112
Yo, isn't Reese back
from gettin' my dry cleanin'?

14:46.179 --> 14:48.949
Regine, he's a housekeeper
not an errand boy.

14:49.015 --> 14:51.384
Call him what you want.
He's gettin' my laundry.

14:52.519 --> 14:54.354
Okay, ladies

14:54.420 --> 14:55.622
time to swab the decks.

14:55.689 --> 14:58.091
Chop, chop.
Let's move some furniture!

15:00.126 --> 15:03.203
Ms. Hunter,
your dry cleaning

15:03.269 --> 15:06.540
and your feminine products.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.042
No, you didn't.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.545
Girl, please.
My coupon expires today.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.781
Reese, have you been
near my desk again?

15:14.848 --> 15:18.251
No! I‐I've steered clear
of that sacred ground.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.721
In fact, I won't be

15:20.787 --> 15:23.289
darkening your doorway
any longer.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.792
What? You, you're
not quittin' on me?

15:25.859 --> 15:27.528
Uh, not just on you.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.730
On the entire profession.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.197
In a few short hours

15:31.264 --> 15:33.099
your industrious roommate

15:33.166 --> 15:35.602
has shown me
how inadequate I am.

15:38.104 --> 15:41.241
Oh, but, Reese, I was just
tryin' to help a brother out.

15:41.307 --> 15:44.745
And what a magnificent job
you've done!

15:47.247 --> 15:49.015
This doorknob

15:49.082 --> 15:52.719
it shines as though
it opens the gate to heaven.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.689
Get up off that now.
Don't touch it.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.660
You are a domestic dynamo.

16:00.827 --> 16:04.971
I am not worthy
to carry your feather duster.

16:05.038 --> 16:08.474
Now, I'm generally a pretty
compassionate person..

16:09.543 --> 16:11.878
...but this is just stupid.

16:11.945 --> 16:15.215
Reese, this old house
used to be this old mess.

16:15.281 --> 16:17.450
But your presence here
made me understand

16:17.518 --> 16:20.086
that I could clean like
I've never cleaned before.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.221
Isn't that what
a good leader does

16:21.287 --> 16:22.488
lead by motivation?

16:22.556 --> 16:24.858
Like Benson
and the Governor?

16:24.925 --> 16:28.094
‐ Hey, I need you.
‐ The profession needs you.

16:28.995 --> 16:31.497
The world needs you.

16:31.565 --> 16:34.000
Ms. James, you've rekindled
my lust to dust.

16:34.067 --> 16:35.368
Here.

16:35.435 --> 16:36.703
‐ Go, man, go.
‐ Thank you.

16:39.439 --> 16:42.609
Hey, um, Reese,
this isn't my scarf.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.310
Gucci.

16:45.846 --> 16:46.847
Never mind.

16:52.218 --> 16:54.821
Oh, hey, Max. How's the search
for the new crib goin'?

16:54.888 --> 16:56.890
Does this sofa still pull out
into a bed?

16:59.292 --> 17:01.134
Watch out, Khadijah.

17:01.201 --> 17:03.269
He might find
a 90‐watt bulb

17:03.336 --> 17:05.672
in a 60‐watt socket
and have you shot.

17:07.440 --> 17:10.777
I'm not gonna sink
to your level of immaturity

17:10.844 --> 17:12.112
homeless woman.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.750
‐ Look, man, let me tell you‐‐
‐ It's your fault. You..

17:16.817 --> 17:17.784
‐ I don't give no..
‐ Put yourself in the..

17:17.851 --> 17:20.820
Hey! I'm trying'
to watch TV here.

17:20.887 --> 17:23.757
Shaggy and Scooby are about
to unmask the fake ghost.

17:26.192 --> 17:27.728
I knew it was you!

17:27.794 --> 17:30.263
Ah, those meddling kids.

17:30.330 --> 17:32.332
Are you just gonna
let him sit there

17:32.398 --> 17:34.467
after he had
your sister evicted?

17:34.535 --> 17:36.136
He didn't get you
evicted, Max.

17:36.202 --> 17:37.403
You got yourself evicted.

17:37.470 --> 17:38.672
Testify.

17:40.240 --> 17:42.042
Et tu, Khadijah?

17:42.108 --> 17:44.144
Max, come on, now.

17:44.210 --> 17:47.748
Look, Overton,
has always had our back.

17:47.814 --> 17:49.916
I mean, when you
were outta work

17:49.983 --> 17:51.417
who made you
his apprentice?

17:54.755 --> 17:56.657
And when he had insomnia

17:56.723 --> 17:58.458
who built you a sauna?

18:01.401 --> 18:03.904
And who is always
coming over to your house

18:03.970 --> 18:06.039
to fix things for free?

18:09.409 --> 18:10.711
'Come on.'

18:12.579 --> 18:13.680
[clears throat]

18:14.648 --> 18:16.717
Uh, Mr. Jones..

18:16.783 --> 18:18.985
...perhaps I was remiss
in my assignation

18:19.052 --> 18:21.955
of blame with regard
to my domicile.

18:22.022 --> 18:24.691
Ipso facto,
I imputed responsibility

18:24.758 --> 18:25.892
on an inculpable party

18:25.959 --> 18:28.061
a grievous error
and judgment I regret.

18:30.030 --> 18:31.632
Ebonically speakin'

18:33.166 --> 18:35.736
word up she was dead wrong
and she be sorry.

18:40.206 --> 18:41.708
Oh, okay.
So, we cool.

18:41.775 --> 18:43.844
‐ Yo, way to go, girl.
‐ I know.

18:43.910 --> 18:45.045
Well, alright, Khadijah,
you mind

18:45.111 --> 18:46.713
if I store some stuff
over here?

18:46.780 --> 18:48.815
My bed, my tennis racket, me?

18:50.651 --> 18:53.554
You know, Mr. Leon
might see things differently

18:53.620 --> 18:55.822
if the bunion was
on the other foot.

18:57.257 --> 18:58.391
What are you gettin' at?

18:58.458 --> 19:00.634
Well, allow this Boy
Scout to show you

19:00.701 --> 19:01.668
that he too has

19:01.735 --> 19:04.304
a...dark side.

19:06.607 --> 19:07.608
Overton..

19:07.674 --> 19:09.610
Boy, this better be good

19:09.676 --> 19:11.311
'cause I was dreamin'

19:11.377 --> 19:14.047
about Cleopatra Jones.

19:14.114 --> 19:15.849
She had gotten behind
in her rent

19:15.916 --> 19:19.352
and we was just about
to work somethin' out.

19:20.754 --> 19:22.756
I just thought
you'd like to know

19:22.823 --> 19:24.124
that the problem
with the reception

19:24.190 --> 19:26.459
is not with the satellite dish.

19:26.527 --> 19:29.530
Actually, the wirin'
in the buildin' is quite old.

19:29.596 --> 19:31.532
Did someone say "Old wiring?"

19:31.598 --> 19:33.066
Who the hell are you?

19:33.133 --> 19:35.101
Inspector James,
Department of Housing.

19:37.771 --> 19:39.673
Uh, there isn't a problem
with the wiring

19:39.740 --> 19:40.974
is there, inspector?

19:41.041 --> 19:44.144
Not as long as you don't mind
waking up on fire.

19:44.210 --> 19:45.612
I know you.

19:45.679 --> 19:47.781
You that hip‐hop chick
from across the street.

19:50.551 --> 19:54.120
Yeah, well,
I'm also a paramedic..

19:54.821 --> 19:56.356
...and a paralegal

19:57.558 --> 20:00.934
and I'm at the top
of my Amway Pyramid.

20:01.001 --> 20:03.637
Mr. Leon didn't mean
to upset you, inspector

20:03.704 --> 20:04.738
did you, Mr. Leon?

20:04.805 --> 20:06.206
Oh, no!

20:06.272 --> 20:07.808
Oh, of course not.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.342
Look, I'm going
to hire someone

20:09.409 --> 20:11.812
to clean up this mess
immediately.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.914
Well, you know
outside contractor's gonna

20:13.980 --> 20:16.850
cost you upwards of 15 grand.

20:16.917 --> 20:18.685
Overton, you know I ain't got
that kinda scratch.

20:18.752 --> 20:21.622
Okay, hands behind your back,
palms facin' up, please.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.557
‐ Hold on, inspector.
‐ Maybe I can help out.

20:23.624 --> 20:25.025
Look, look here, Mr. Leon.

20:25.091 --> 20:27.260
Uh, you know, if you buy
all the materials

20:27.327 --> 20:30.096
I can fix everything up
with my regular salary.

20:30.163 --> 20:31.297
Thank God

20:31.364 --> 20:33.466
'cause I'm too pretty
to go to prison.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.103
There is one hitch.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.105
Max has got to stay.

20:45.579 --> 20:47.213
Tell her to stop writin'
"Go to hell"

20:47.280 --> 20:49.182
on her rent checks..

20:49.249 --> 20:50.984
...and we got a deal.

20:51.051 --> 20:52.719
Hey, I can fix the wirin'

20:52.786 --> 20:54.721
but I am not God.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.226
You know, Mr. Leon..

21:00.293 --> 21:02.402

21:10.410 --> 21:12.546
‐ We got him.
‐ Good, good, good, good, good!

21:12.613 --> 21:14.548
‐ Good, inspector.
‐ Oh, my goodness.

21:14.615 --> 21:16.583
You're lucky
I didn't break character.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.018
Oh, I wanted to beat him down

21:18.084 --> 21:20.020
when he called me
a hip‐hop chick.

21:20.887 --> 21:22.656
I'll give him some hip hop.

21:22.723 --> 21:25.425
[laughing]

21:25.491 --> 21:26.993
All I wanna know is, uh

21:27.060 --> 21:28.895

with them handcuffs?

21:28.962 --> 21:30.897
I need those back.

21:32.899 --> 21:34.167
Hot date tonight.

21:39.139 --> 21:40.774
