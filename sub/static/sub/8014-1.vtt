00:53.101 --> 00:55.501
You scored yourself a
nice corner. Good job.

00:55.503 --> 00:57.671
Hi. I'm Maura Ellis.

00:57.673 --> 00:59.772
I'm not part of a
religious group or anything.

00:59.774 --> 01:03.143
I'm just a nurse who likes
to give back on her days off.

01:03.145 --> 01:05.111
You know, when you're living outdoors,

01:05.114 --> 01:06.946
skin cancer is a real concern.

01:06.948 --> 01:08.714
So I got you some sunscreen,

01:08.716 --> 01:11.550
and you, my friend, have
some irregular moles.

01:11.552 --> 01:13.452
You're a very friendly person.

01:13.454 --> 01:15.755
Wanna come to my house and take a shower?

01:15.757 --> 01:17.023
Maybe make a list of goals?

01:17.025 --> 01:18.824
Oh, I have a girlfriend.

01:18.826 --> 01:20.860
Great. It's important to have
a lady out there in the street.

01:20.862 --> 01:23.529
What do you call it, a
road bitch or something?

01:23.531 --> 01:24.663
Her name's Karen.

01:24.665 --> 01:26.732
Your little mama? Your street wife?

01:26.734 --> 01:27.901
(SIGHS) Anyway,

01:27.903 --> 01:29.403
I'm pretty good with sayings,

01:29.405 --> 01:33.874
so I make these cards for my sister,
but I think maybe you could use one.

01:33.876 --> 01:37.109
Without the dark night, we
would never see the bright stars.

01:37.111 --> 01:38.412
Is this from <i>Twilight?</i>

01:38.414 --> 01:39.478
No, I made it up.

01:39.480 --> 01:40.880
Mmm, no, you didn't.

01:40.882 --> 01:41.948
Yeah, I did.

01:41.950 --> 01:43.817
See you later.

01:43.819 --> 01:44.918
Wait.

01:44.920 --> 01:46.485
Wait a minute.

01:46.487 --> 01:47.720
Hey!

01:47.722 --> 01:49.156
You're not homeless?

01:49.158 --> 01:50.589
You were on a roll.

01:50.591 --> 01:51.991
Well, give me back the sunscreen

01:51.993 --> 01:53.993
so I can give it to an
actual homeless person!

01:53.995 --> 01:55.162
Like this lady.

01:55.164 --> 01:58.865
Fuck off! I'm the manager here.

01:58.867 --> 02:00.736
0 for 2.

02:02.805 --> 02:05.806
MAURA: Polenta! Come get your dinner.

02:05.808 --> 02:08.708
(LAPTOP RINGING)

02:08.710 --> 02:10.509
Mom?

02:10.512 --> 02:11.710
- Hi. Can you hear me?
- (MEOWING)

02:11.712 --> 02:13.913
BUCKY: <i>Hiya, kid. What
are you up to today?</i>

02:13.915 --> 02:16.615
Dad, come in front of the
camera so I can see you.

02:16.617 --> 02:18.518
DEANNA: <i>How are things
at the hospital, honey?</i>

02:18.520 --> 02:20.554
<i>We heard that Atlanta
had a terrible storm.</i>

02:20.556 --> 02:21.788
- <i>Garage sale.</i>
- Okay.

02:21.790 --> 02:25.524
Can you guys both sit in front
of the camera when you talk

02:25.526 --> 02:27.727
so that I can see you and
hear you at the same time?

02:27.729 --> 02:30.030
- <i>We don't get this Skype crap.</i>
- There's nothing to get.

02:30.032 --> 02:31.798
- You're doing it.
- DEANNA: <i>Maura,</i>

02:31.800 --> 02:33.566
<i>we have some news.</i>

02:33.568 --> 02:35.837
<i>Maura, we have some news.</i>

02:36.972 --> 02:39.138
- Oh, my God. Who's sick?
- BUCKY: <i>Oh, for cry-eye, Maura.</i>

02:39.140 --> 02:41.240
<i>Relax!</i>

02:41.242 --> 02:44.178
<i>We decided</i>

02:46.514 --> 02:48.681
<i>to sell the house.</i>

02:48.683 --> 02:50.951
Yeah, okay. Funny joke. What's the news?

02:50.953 --> 02:52.619
<i>We are. We're selling it.</i>

02:52.621 --> 02:54.086
The one we grew up in?

02:54.088 --> 02:55.187
Are you selling it to each other?

02:55.189 --> 02:56.655
<i>No, honey.</i>

02:56.657 --> 02:59.024
- Why would you do that?
- DEANNA: <i>We don't want it anymore.</i>

02:59.026 --> 03:00.092
- <i>It's too big.</i>
- Look, if this is some kind

03:00.094 --> 03:02.762
of financial thing, I can
help you out with money.

03:02.764 --> 03:04.364
DEANNA: <i>No, honey.</i>

03:04.366 --> 03:07.500
<i>All we need you to do is to
come and clean out your bedroom</i>

03:07.502 --> 03:08.768
<i>because it's a bottomless pit.</i>

03:08.770 --> 03:11.971
Okay. I can come. Just don't
make a move until I get there.

03:11.973 --> 03:13.773
Does Kate know about this?

03:13.775 --> 03:15.574
BUCKY: <i>We haven't told her yet.</i>

03:15.576 --> 03:17.911
<i>You two take news so differently.</i>

03:17.913 --> 03:20.746
<i>We wondered if maybe</i>

03:20.748 --> 03:23.048
<i>you should tell her.</i>

03:23.050 --> 03:24.684
<i>Because we don't want to.</i>

03:24.686 --> 03:26.722
Why do I always have to be the one?

03:27.756 --> 03:28.788
Oh, shit.

03:28.790 --> 03:31.124
I think you guys froze.
Hold on. Can you hear me?

03:31.126 --> 03:33.692
Hello?

03:33.694 --> 03:35.961
You're blinking. You're fake freezing.

03:35.963 --> 03:39.766
Unbelievable. Just call
her. You're her parents.

03:39.768 --> 03:42.102
(SNEEZES)

03:42.104 --> 03:45.407
Dad! Let it go.

03:52.881 --> 03:56.549
KATE: See, where most stylists
blow it is they color your hair

03:56.551 --> 03:58.918
- but they leave your Santa eyebrows.
- Hmm.

03:58.920 --> 04:00.987
They half-ass it, but I'm a perfectionist.

04:00.989 --> 04:02.288
Thank you.

04:02.290 --> 04:05.225
So why are we covering
this gray today, Phil?

04:05.227 --> 04:09.796
Well, I have a date with an engaging
new gal, somewhat younger than me.

04:09.798 --> 04:12.097
Good for you, because ladies
your age are gross, right?

04:12.099 --> 04:15.234
Well, I just hope it looks
natural. It smells very strong.

04:15.236 --> 04:17.870
No. It's super gentle. They
use it on pageant babies.

04:17.872 --> 04:19.272
Mom! I'm home!

04:19.274 --> 04:20.906
(SHRIEKS)

04:20.908 --> 04:23.310
My daughter's home! She has
been gone half the summer.

04:23.312 --> 04:26.613
I'll be right back. If it feels
like it's burning, it's working.

04:26.615 --> 04:28.214
(BOTH SHRIEKING)

04:28.216 --> 04:30.283
- Wow!
- (LAUGHS AND SHRIEKS)

04:30.285 --> 04:34.154
(GRUNTS) You have been gone
for so long! Did you get taller?

04:34.156 --> 04:36.822
I've only been gone a month, and
I stopped growing a long time ago.

04:36.824 --> 04:38.591
Um, is this supposed to be getting warm?

04:38.593 --> 04:40.026
Let it cook, Phil.

04:40.028 --> 04:41.327
HALEY: Um...

04:41.329 --> 04:43.062
Mom?

04:43.064 --> 04:45.130
Why are you doing some
guy's hair in the bathroom?

04:45.132 --> 04:47.666
- Huh?
- P.S. this does not feel right. Hello.

04:47.668 --> 04:48.969
(HISSING)

04:48.971 --> 04:51.070
Why aren't you doing it in a salon?

04:51.072 --> 04:52.305
Please don't tell me
you quit your job again.

04:52.307 --> 04:54.106
I didn't quit! All right.

04:54.108 --> 04:56.041
You know that dipshit
lady on Channel Eleven

04:56.043 --> 04:58.010
who does the segments
where she tries new things?

04:58.012 --> 05:00.312
- Yeah. Go on.
- Well, she wanted bangs,

05:00.314 --> 05:02.949
but then afterwards she decided
that she didn't want bangs.

05:02.951 --> 05:04.817
And my manager started bitching me out,

05:04.819 --> 05:07.320
so I shoved him and his
American Girl Doll glasses broke.

05:07.322 --> 05:08.788
Okay. So you got fired.

05:08.790 --> 05:11.690
Why do you keep doing this, Mom?

05:11.692 --> 05:13.093
You wanna have a cereal party?

05:13.095 --> 05:16.997
No, I don't. I want you to be
responsible so that I don't have to be.

05:16.999 --> 05:18.365
It is too stressful

05:18.367 --> 05:21.901
sleeping with you on a pull-out
couch in your friend's dining room.

05:21.903 --> 05:23.836
She is not my friend. She was our bug man.

05:23.838 --> 05:26.238
I need to learn to be more irresponsible

05:26.240 --> 05:29.709
otherwise I'm going to be
hazed so bad in college.

05:29.711 --> 05:30.776
It's bubbling like Pop Rocks.

05:30.778 --> 05:32.077
- I'm gonna stay at Annie's house again.
- All right.

05:32.079 --> 05:35.781
Okay, that's a lie because Annie
is in Italy with her family.

05:35.783 --> 05:37.117
I know how to use Facebook.

05:37.119 --> 05:40.019
I will keep sending you pictures
so that you know that I'm safe.

05:40.021 --> 05:42.122
No. You cannot just leave again
and not tell me where you are.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.390
You know why I don't
tell you where I'm going?

05:44.392 --> 05:47.360
Because you'll show up there and
you'll make a big scene like a hothead!

05:47.362 --> 05:50.130
I am not a hothead! I am brassy.

05:50.132 --> 05:53.433
I love you, Mom, but your life
is just too chaotic right now.

05:53.435 --> 05:55.570
- It is not chaotic.
- DANA: Kate!

05:57.238 --> 05:58.772
Is this your waxing strip?

05:58.774 --> 06:01.007
I don't know, Dana. It must be a client's.

06:01.009 --> 06:03.743
My dog had this in his feces.

06:03.745 --> 06:05.211
- (WHIMPERS)
- And before I could stop him

06:05.213 --> 06:08.914
he ate the poop with the
waxing strip in it again.

06:08.916 --> 06:11.117
- And then he threw that up.
- Okay.

06:11.119 --> 06:13.920
You know how many times a day
I kiss that dog on the mouth?

06:13.922 --> 06:15.387
An unsettling amount.

06:15.389 --> 06:17.423
Now when I kiss him,

06:17.425 --> 06:20.293
I'm gonna picture that he ate

06:20.295 --> 06:22.995
some stranger's pubes.

06:22.997 --> 06:25.231
And it's gonna affect
my relationship with him.

06:25.233 --> 06:26.800
KATE: Oh, boy.

06:26.802 --> 06:28.067
All right. Let's bring
this in for a landing, Dana.

06:28.069 --> 06:29.902
You get out of here by tomorrow.

06:29.904 --> 06:31.303
- (STAMMERS)
- You're done!

06:31.305 --> 06:33.807
- Where the hell am I gonna go?
- (BARKING)

06:33.809 --> 06:36.009
You wanna explain that to my daughter?

06:36.011 --> 06:37.409
- Haley?
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)

06:37.411 --> 06:40.312
Shit.

06:40.314 --> 06:41.748
(SHOUTS) Haley?

06:41.750 --> 06:43.551
Haley!

06:45.454 --> 06:47.786
Okay, Haley, just come back
up, and we will talk about this.

06:47.788 --> 06:48.921
Hey, it's me.

06:48.923 --> 06:51.724
Hello? This is very unprofessional.

06:51.726 --> 06:53.325
Hey. I can't talk right now.

06:53.327 --> 06:54.793
Real quick. Mom and Dad called.

06:54.795 --> 06:56.128
Ugh, what now?

06:56.130 --> 06:57.997
What's up? Everything all right?

06:57.999 --> 07:01.200
- No, I don't need lotion in there.
- (SHUSHES)

07:01.202 --> 07:02.836
Yeah, you do need lotion in there.

07:02.838 --> 07:04.771
Hey, here's something fun.

07:04.773 --> 07:07.005
Mom and Dad want us to come down.

07:07.007 --> 07:09.743
<i>They need us to clear out
some of our old bedroom stuff.</i>

07:09.745 --> 07:11.444
Why? They have other rooms.

07:11.446 --> 07:14.147
MAURA: <i>I don't know. Maybe
they wanna get a treadmill.</i>

07:14.149 --> 07:17.819
(SCOFFS) A treadmill? Mom
can't even sit right on a couch.

07:21.189 --> 07:23.389
- I'm just gonna shape them real quick.
- All right.

07:23.391 --> 07:26.358
Yeah, no. I can't afford to
come to Orlando right now.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.327
Well, I'll send you money for the flight.

07:28.329 --> 07:31.964
Come to Orlando. Ellis sisters reunion.

07:31.966 --> 07:35.468
<i>Coming home always
makes things better.</i>

07:35.470 --> 07:38.538
That's actually a really good idea.

07:38.540 --> 07:40.942
Tell me the truth.

07:42.410 --> 07:45.881
<i>Next stop, Orlando Airport.
Thank you for riding Greyhound.</i>

07:51.153 --> 07:53.152
AIRPORT ANNOUNCER ON PA: <i>Please
maintain contact with your baggage.</i>

07:53.154 --> 07:56.356
<i>All unattended baggage
will be confiscated.</i>

07:56.358 --> 07:59.959
Hey. Could I get a small glass of tequila?

07:59.961 --> 08:02.495
Like a shot of tequila?

08:02.497 --> 08:05.197
Yeah, a shot. Just keeping it classy.

08:05.199 --> 08:06.365
Paging Mr. Herman.

08:06.367 --> 08:08.034
Oh, Mr. Pee-wee Herman!

08:08.036 --> 08:09.435
(KATE SHRIEKS)

08:09.437 --> 08:12.005
- Look at you.
- Hi!

08:12.007 --> 08:13.038
- MAURA: Look at you.
- KATE: Uh-uh, uh-uh.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.873
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

08:14.875 --> 08:17.243
- Wow, turn it around. This is soft.
- (CHUCKLES)

08:17.245 --> 08:18.877
- You look great.
- No.

08:18.879 --> 08:21.214
I look like a dead deer
bloated on the highway.

08:21.216 --> 08:24.082
No. You look like a pretty
deer who's still alive.

08:24.084 --> 08:25.819
- Mmm.
- But also, just recently hit.

08:25.821 --> 08:27.219
(SNORTING)

08:27.221 --> 08:29.856
- Your hair is long! It's so mermaid-y.
- Yeah.

08:29.858 --> 08:33.258
Oh, I got a whole intricate sewn-in
system under there, but it's human.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.227
Okay, well, you have to be
careful when you get fake hair

08:35.230 --> 08:38.131
because some countries give
their young girls chicken hormones

08:38.133 --> 08:40.232
- and make them grow it in their basements.
- (SCOFFS)

08:40.235 --> 08:42.871
Do they get paid? Because I would do that.

08:44.004 --> 08:47.140
Hey, honey. I'm sure you're out having fun

08:47.142 --> 08:52.045
but I'm dying to see that
photo you were gonna send me.

08:52.047 --> 08:55.180
She's having such a great summer,
but I think she's getting homesick.

08:55.182 --> 08:57.349
- I'm sure she misses you.
- I miss her.

08:57.351 --> 09:00.118
Like, in my body.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.421
Mmm. She'll be back soon.

09:02.423 --> 09:04.257
What's your deal? Been doing anything fun?

09:04.259 --> 09:07.160
Yeah. Rescue dogs have
so many hidden skills.

09:07.162 --> 09:10.997
I've been teaching Polenta
how to smell diabetes.

09:10.999 --> 09:12.299
You've been divorced for two years.

09:12.301 --> 09:15.568
You should at least be going to
Chili's with your work friends

09:15.570 --> 09:17.337
or some such basic shit,

09:17.339 --> 09:19.504
instead of spending the night
on Skype dates with Mom and Dad.

09:19.506 --> 09:21.541
I've been having a lot of fun.

09:21.543 --> 09:23.844
I've been teaching
myself how to make cheese.

09:24.946 --> 09:27.379
I'm fine. I'm really good. I'm real good.

09:27.381 --> 09:30.416
What about you? Do you have
a job or a place to live?

09:30.418 --> 09:32.517
I got an idea that's gonna solve
everything. Haley's gonna flip.

09:32.519 --> 09:34.420
What's your idea?

(LAUGHS) Hey, look at you.

10:10.057 --> 10:12.992
Come on, Dave Blackmon! I was
a senior, you were a junior.

10:12.994 --> 10:15.228
I lingered back so we
could be seniors together?

10:15.230 --> 10:17.563
You were my first non-hand
I ever did it with.

10:17.565 --> 10:20.967
Oh, my God. Yes. I swallowed your earring.

10:20.969 --> 10:22.502
That was a true honor.

10:22.504 --> 10:24.369
Aw, thank you. Thank you.

10:24.371 --> 10:26.539
Wow. Somebody told me you died.

10:26.541 --> 10:28.708
That's crazy. That's the second
person that's said that to me.

10:28.710 --> 10:29.709
Hmm, you should check it out.

Island parties, baby. (VOCALIZES)

Such good times, right?

10:36.317 --> 10:39.051
Yeah. You scaling that
fireplace with them heels?

10:39.053 --> 10:40.686
Oh, man. That was a beautiful sight, baby.

10:40.688 --> 10:44.123
And who's this fine-ass female?

10:44.125 --> 10:47.426
Hi, Dave. I'm Maura, Kate's younger sister.

10:47.428 --> 10:50.563
I held your mullet back one time
when you were vomiting at our party

10:50.565 --> 10:53.432
so you wouldn't impale your
face on our cactus garden.

10:53.434 --> 10:56.335
(LAUGHING) No. Shit. Those
were fun times, though, huh?

10:56.337 --> 10:59.071
Yeah. You know, in a way.

10:59.073 --> 11:01.708
You sure bloomed into
a juicy peach, holy...

KATE: So is this your liquor store?

11:04.446 --> 11:07.412
Oh, you know, I got some stock,
I got some handshake options.

11:07.414 --> 11:08.982
Because you heard what happened, right?

11:08.984 --> 11:11.316

- Eaten by a sinkhole?

- Mmm-hmm.
- That is a Florida heartbreak.

- Just putting it out there.
- Listen, life is about putting it out there.

11:26.533 --> 11:27.767
- And then swatting it away.
- Isn't it?

11:27.769 --> 11:30.236
Sometimes it stays out
there. Where you put it.

11:30.238 --> 11:31.637
And then sometimes it
goes right into the trash.

11:31.639 --> 11:33.272
So that's, like, a no. I understand.

11:33.274 --> 11:34.574
I think we should go.
Great to see you, Dave.

and we were considering it.

this without consulting me.

smell urine-y, like a death-cafeteria.

home, it's an adult community.

15:54.635 --> 15:57.435
Why didn't you tell me
that you sold the house?

try to talk us out of it.

No, I'm not dying. I'm
just sick of winding them.

meant something to us.

piece in the story of our lives.

16:42.015 --> 16:43.581
No!

16:43.583 --> 16:46.651

man at the flea market

16:46.653 --> 16:48.753

to do is go to lunch.

the house is the best plan for us.

up. It's all spiffed out.

house, I wanna poop at the house.

29:48.634 --> 29:51.402
- Hae-Won.
- Hae-Won.

29:51.404 --> 29:53.572
I feel like I'm saying it right. No?

29:53.574 --> 29:56.440
I'm too high. (DEEP
VOICE) Hae-Hae-Won.

29:56.442 --> 29:58.209
Yes.

29:58.211 --> 29:59.744
It's not coming out right, but I'll get it.

29:59.746 --> 30:02.581
Like, "I'm having fun at party."

30:02.583 --> 30:05.784
"Hey." Plus "one."

30:05.786 --> 30:08.786
Hey one.

30:08.788 --> 30:10.455
- So you like parties.
- HAE-WON: Yes.

30:10.457 --> 30:11.555
Hmm.

30:11.557 --> 30:14.325
- Your name?
- Oh, my name is Maura.

30:14.327 --> 30:15.794
Maura.

30:15.796 --> 30:17.295
Watch me. Maura.

30:17.297 --> 30:18.763
(GROWLING) Maura.

30:18.765 --> 30:21.399
I don't open my mouth like
that. (CHUCKLES) Just, Maura.

30:21.401 --> 30:22.633
Maura.

30:22.635 --> 30:24.803
It's not Maura.

30:24.805 --> 30:27.439
You see the difference in my mouth? Maura.

30:27.441 --> 30:28.640
(GROWLING) Maura.

30:28.642 --> 30:30.142
We have different mouths.

30:30.144 --> 30:32.045
It's okay.

30:34.647 --> 30:38.549
Why do they always have to give
them American names? It's so sad.

30:38.551 --> 30:41.686
I bet Nail Pimp Daddy over there
treats them like his whores.

30:41.688 --> 30:43.889
- We need to get Lucy Liu to go under...
- Lisa Ling.

30:43.891 --> 30:47.292
Lisa Ling to go undercover and
investigate these dirty-ass nail salons.

30:47.294 --> 30:50.761
But they are hiring and you
are licensed to do nails.

30:50.763 --> 30:53.797
I don't wanna work here. They
have a bass in their aquarium.

30:53.799 --> 30:56.601
It's beautiful here.
Everything smells like lavender.

30:56.603 --> 30:58.937
Plus, you could teach them a
lot, because you know your shit.

30:58.939 --> 31:00.771
I do know my shit.

31:00.773 --> 31:03.509
I could French manicure a
chicken while it was running away.

31:04.810 --> 31:06.878
Guess I could get something
better once we're settled, right?

31:06.880 --> 31:10.382
Exactly! And then just wait
until you get that better job

31:10.384 --> 31:12.717
before you quit this one.

31:12.719 --> 31:15.421
I'm open to new ways.

31:16.957 --> 31:18.957
(SIGHS) So, do you like working here?

31:18.959 --> 31:21.061
I love it.

31:22.429 --> 31:23.827
Do you get proper lunch breaks?

31:23.829 --> 31:25.963
What is lunch?

31:25.965 --> 31:28.199
Oh, my God. That's terrible.

31:28.201 --> 31:29.567
Hey.

31:29.569 --> 31:31.569
Thank you so much for
this. This is a great place.

31:31.571 --> 31:32.873
NAIL SALON OWNER: Of course.

31:35.375 --> 31:38.045
So, uh, I see you're hiring.

31:39.946 --> 31:42.948
Oh, we are not hiring right now.

31:42.950 --> 31:45.683
You just got a big old sign.

31:45.685 --> 31:49.554
Hey, Hae-Won. Would you like
to come to a party tonight?

31:49.556 --> 31:51.555
You and your friends come, okay?

31:51.557 --> 31:52.958
To do nail?

31:52.960 --> 31:55.427
Oh, no. No, no, no. Party?

31:55.429 --> 31:56.728
You can bring whoever you want.

31:56.730 --> 31:59.264
Party, yes.

31:59.266 --> 32:01.665
- Sojus.
- Jews.

32:01.667 --> 32:04.001
- Soju there?
- Sure. There'll be Jews there.

32:04.003 --> 32:07.271
I love jus. Koreans love jus.

32:07.273 --> 32:08.440
Koreans love Jews.

32:08.442 --> 32:10.307
- I love jus.
- I love Jews, too.

32:10.309 --> 32:11.543
Jus.

32:11.545 --> 32:14.511
Adam is thinking of coming,
and Gabe is on the fence, so...

32:14.513 --> 32:15.613
Soju.

32:15.615 --> 32:18.783
I'm worried we aren't
talking about the same thing.

32:18.785 --> 32:20.719
- Juice. Drinking juice.
- HAE-WON: Jus.

32:20.721 --> 32:22.254
You stupid.

32:22.256 --> 32:24.689
There'll be juice there. There'll be
food there. There'll be Jews there.

32:24.691 --> 32:26.658
- Okay. Yes.
- Great.

32:26.660 --> 32:29.526
Okay, listen. My daughter
and I are moving to Orlando

32:29.528 --> 32:31.729
and I really need a job.

32:31.731 --> 32:34.066
Oh, no.

32:36.869 --> 32:39.770
Okay, look. Just smile and shake
my hand like you gave me a job

32:39.772 --> 32:41.472
and I will text you a picture of my boobs.

32:41.474 --> 32:43.607
Real good ones. High and happy.

32:43.609 --> 32:45.376
No? I misread your deal.

32:45.378 --> 32:46.577
Smile and shake my hand

32:46.579 --> 32:48.947
(WHISPERING) or I will text
you a picture of my boobs,

32:48.949 --> 32:50.481
and I know you don't wanna see them.

32:50.483 --> 32:52.383
(CHUCKLES)

32:52.385 --> 32:54.686
Awesome! Thank you, Vicky.

32:54.688 --> 32:57.788
I will see you on Monday.

32:57.790 --> 32:59.958
Boom! I got a job.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.994
And look what I pulled out of your
wallet. "Success is desire in action."

33:02.996 --> 33:04.763
Amazing! You're crushing it!

33:04.765 --> 33:06.064
Whoo!

33:06.066 --> 33:07.365
KATE: We need to cancel
dinner with Mom and Dad.

33:07.367 --> 33:10.468
What if we lie to Mom and Dad
and then they die in their sleep?

Don't let them smell your guilt.

33:15.474 --> 33:17.642
Hey, Mom, we are doing
so much work over there

33:17.644 --> 33:20.478
and doing nothing else,
and I am telling the truth.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.080
Well.

33:22.082 --> 33:26.317
I was just, um, putting the
silverware in the drawers here.

33:26.319 --> 33:28.452
Hey, we can't have dinner tonight.

33:28.454 --> 33:33.591
Yeah, because we're in such packing
mode we don't wanna stop our groove.

33:33.593 --> 33:35.362
Sounds good!

33:48.709 --> 33:49.774
Oh.

33:49.776 --> 33:51.609
No. We've...

33:51.611 --> 33:52.977
Okay!

33:52.979 --> 33:54.845
- KATE: Bye.
- We're leaving!

33:54.847 --> 33:57.015
Did we just cock block our parents?

33:57.017 --> 33:58.682
They were fresh off the sex griddle.

33:58.684 --> 34:00.786
There was so much color in her face.

34:02.823 --> 34:05.957
Hey, see you tonight! You know, I'm
laying down a bread base. (CHUCKLES)

34:05.959 --> 34:08.125
So I wanna stop by Sam and
Cray's house, real quick.

34:08.127 --> 34:09.893
Oh, I haven't seen those
homos since high school!

34:09.896 --> 34:11.862
I know.

34:11.864 --> 34:13.864
They said that we could borrow those
cool chairs they had at their wedding.

34:13.867 --> 34:16.501
Gays know how to throw a party.

34:16.503 --> 34:19.737
Go to Costco, get a pan of hot wings.

34:19.739 --> 34:21.972
Get some big, basic salamis.

34:21.974 --> 34:24.708
Or just make a fuckload of potato salad.

34:24.710 --> 34:26.043
With Tostitos Scoops.

34:26.045 --> 34:29.045
It's like a spoon you can eat.

34:29.047 --> 34:33.617
Obviously, it's the gay men
who have the great party ideas.

34:33.619 --> 34:36.887
I wish being gay was a choice because I
always did like that shorts and boots look.

34:36.889 --> 34:38.789
Yeah, I don't know.

34:38.791 --> 34:40.492
For me, the deal breaker might
be the eating of the pussy.

34:40.494 --> 34:43.762
Oh, really? Because for me it would just
be the fucking unbearable amount of talking.

34:43.764 --> 34:45.498
Bye, guys!

That looks amazing on you.

34:56.510 --> 34:58.809
I never met a Brayla before.

34:58.811 --> 35:00.478

Oh, so you're trending. God bless.

35:03.150 --> 35:07.851
You know, it's a lot of under teat
but I think I'm getting away with it.

35:07.853 --> 35:10.289
Also it's, um, on backwards.

35:12.559 --> 35:15.126
- You think?
- Yeah.

35:15.128 --> 35:16.728
How's it going in there?

35:16.730 --> 35:18.796
I don't get this dress.

35:18.798 --> 35:21.865
One of my apples keeps
rolling out of the bag.

35:21.867 --> 35:24.836
But I like the story it
tells with the fringe.

35:24.838 --> 35:26.637
You're gonna have to rock
a thong with this, though.

35:26.639 --> 35:29.673
Oh, no, I don't wear thongs.
I have a very fussy taint.

35:29.675 --> 35:32.110
You just have to build up
a callus. Right, Brayla?

35:32.112 --> 35:34.579
That looks amazing on you.

35:34.581 --> 35:37.215
I worry that she just wants the
sale. She's not telling us the truth.

35:37.217 --> 35:40.918
- No. Brayla has no pleasure center in her brain.

Gramps, and you know I love Orlando.

35:53.599 --> 35:55.934
I'm super excited about this!

35:55.936 --> 35:57.969
Yeah, you know what? I was
real excited about it, too,

35:57.971 --> 36:01.039
and it turns out that Gram and
Gramps are selling their house.

36:01.041 --> 36:02.673
Oh...

36:02.675 --> 36:05.844
Okay, I like that it has a strong message,

36:05.846 --> 36:08.012
but I am afraid that I'm
gonna zip my bush up in there.

36:08.014 --> 36:13.050
We can still make Orlando happen.
I promise, I will find another way.

36:13.052 --> 36:15.153
Don't be upset.

36:15.155 --> 36:16.720

- Hey, honey. It's Maura.
- Hey.

Listen, your mom forgot to tell
you the most important part,

36:20.960 --> 36:25.496
which is that she got a job out
here at a very fancy nail salon.

earlier next week, and surprise her.

She really misses you.

going to help you for a while,

back with your mother.

Would you like to flank me at a party

I'm sorry, are you having a party here?

- Nope.
- Nope.

40:48.961 --> 40:51.262
It really looks like you're having a party.

Oh, Gosh. I hate to make
you feel like a dick,

40:53.766 --> 40:56.133
but this is actually for a wake.

40:56.135 --> 40:58.436
I am very sorry to hear that.

40:58.438 --> 41:02.106
Yeah. We always told our cousin,
"Don't play on the tracks."

41:02.108 --> 41:03.407
Dear God.

41:03.409 --> 41:05.041
I'm so sorry for your loss.

41:05.043 --> 41:07.912
Obviously, our cousin was a dumbass.

41:07.914 --> 41:09.380
- But we will miss her.
- Him.

haunt the house forever.

41:28.067 --> 41:29.032
Why?

41:29.034 --> 41:31.903
You've asserted yourself,
and you got a job,

41:31.905 --> 41:34.871
so maybe I could give you a loan.

41:34.873 --> 41:36.574
To get a new place.

41:36.576 --> 41:38.909
When you say, "loan," do you
mean the kind you pay back,

41:38.911 --> 41:41.244
or, like, a "wink-wink" loan?

41:41.246 --> 41:42.345
All loans are supposed to be paid back.

41:42.347 --> 41:43.947
Not in my experience.

41:43.949 --> 41:45.849
But you can do that now
because you have a job.

41:45.851 --> 41:47.985
(SING-SONG) I do.

41:47.987 --> 41:51.322
That is an awesome offer. All right!

41:51.324 --> 41:53.257
Okay, wait.

41:53.259 --> 41:56.260
I am going to ask you for
something in return for the money,

41:56.262 --> 41:58.963
and I don't want you to think that
this loan is contingent on that,

41:58.965 --> 42:00.965
but I will say that if you don't do it,

42:00.967 --> 42:02.934
I feel like I might not give you the money.

42:02.936 --> 42:04.202

just get screwed up. I'll do it.

This where we live, okay?

01:17:43.173 --> 01:17:45.406
And this is our property
for the next 24 hours.

01:17:45.408 --> 01:17:47.675
A lot of sex is gonna
happen. A lot of sexy times.

01:17:47.677 --> 01:17:49.378
You can't stop that.

01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:51.347
Last time I checked, sex
wasn't against the law,

01:17:51.349 --> 01:17:53.415
as much as you would
love that, wouldn't you?

01:17:53.417 --> 01:17:55.084
- Maura, please behave.
- Why don't you step off, blue?

01:17:55.086 --> 01:17:57.285
Don't you know I'm <i>loco?</i> Shit!

01:17:57.287 --> 01:17:58.553
KATE: Now we know that.

01:17:58.555 --> 01:17:59.488
MAURA: Officer Donuts.

01:17:59.490 --> 01:18:01.389
Why don't you go back into your squad car

01:18:01.391 --> 01:18:03.058
and go save a kitten from a tree,

01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:05.126
because these pussies are doing fine.

01:18:05.128 --> 01:18:07.463
So, wrap your mind
around that, Cap'n Crunch.

01:18:07.465 --> 01:18:09.130
Capeach?

01:18:09.132 --> 01:18:11.165
I know something about you.
You're a nice person, right?

01:18:11.167 --> 01:18:15.403
And you look like a Ken doll, hopefully
with the genitals. Fingers crossed.

01:18:15.405 --> 01:18:18.374
You've picked a very great
profession. And I salute you.

01:18:18.376 --> 01:18:20.241
But you know what? This
is how I'll salute you.

01:18:20.243 --> 01:18:22.378
Like this. I'm sorry.

01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:23.544

happen, nobody saw that.

01:18:23.546 --> 01:18:25.046
MAURA: I got this.

01:18:25.048 --> 01:18:26.447
- What are you writing down?
- Nothing. It's my pad.

01:18:26.449 --> 01:18:27.648
MAURA: Here, I have something
you should write down.

01:18:27.650 --> 01:18:30.352
E-A-T.

01:18:30.354 --> 01:18:31.687
S-H-I-T.

01:18:31.689 --> 01:18:35.758
Okay, my sister is clearly riding
the ditch at this late hour.

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.291
Can you shut this shit down?

01:18:37.293 --> 01:18:38.693
(STAMMERS) Was that Maura Ellis?

01:18:38.695 --> 01:18:39.762

(CHUCKLES)

01:18:41.231 --> 01:18:43.031
She went to the sophomore formal

01:18:43.033 --> 01:18:44.366
with my cousin who has spina bifida.

01:18:44.368 --> 01:18:46.335
Of course she did!

01:18:46.337 --> 01:18:49.303
She is a lovely person.
He still talks about it.

01:18:49.305 --> 01:18:52.206
- Yeah.

No. No! Wait!

Good, I think.

01:19:13.697 --> 01:19:15.531
Yeah, I think you're all set.

01:19:15.533 --> 01:19:17.833
I'm gonna have to come back
tomorrow and finish this,

01:19:17.835 --> 01:19:22.236
because I am drunk and stoned.

01:19:22.238 --> 01:19:23.805
- Well, I'm totally sober, so.
- (CHUCKLES) Yeah.

01:19:23.807 --> 01:19:25.273
I did a really bad job.

You're very tall. How tall are you?

01:19:27.744 --> 01:19:31.780
About 6'3". With the ladder, about 7'6".

01:19:31.782 --> 01:19:34.249
- (CHUCKLES)
- So, I'm just gonna...

01:19:34.251 --> 01:19:37.218
Thanks so much for cleaning this all up.

01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:38.788
Oh, yeah.

01:19:40.224 --> 01:19:43.424
Do you wanna keep working off the clock?

01:19:43.426 --> 01:19:45.494
- Yeah.
- Because my bed is broken.

01:19:45.496 --> 01:19:46.594
Do you want me to fix it?

01:19:46.596 --> 01:19:48.131
Yeah. Lock the door.

01:19:49.733 --> 01:19:53.302

here, and I say it's over.

01:19:53.304 --> 01:19:56.537

This is such a brilliant idea!

Free slicking.

I wish we had some lubricant.

01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:14.755
What perfume is on you?

01:20:14.757 --> 01:20:16.124
- You like that?
- Yeah, I do.

You can only get it at Kohl's.

01:20:24.268 --> 01:20:28.538
I cannot!

01:20:30.373 --> 01:20:34.276
What did I ever do to you
to make you abhor me so?

01:20:34.278 --> 01:20:35.777
Are you seriously asking?

01:20:35.779 --> 01:20:37.211
You probably don't remember.

01:20:37.213 --> 01:20:38.379
Oh, I remember.

01:20:38.381 --> 01:20:41.549
We were about to have the
best Ellis Island party ever

01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:44.419
because my cousin met John Stamos
at Disney and he was coming.

01:20:44.421 --> 01:20:47.289
But you narced to your cop dad.

01:20:47.291 --> 01:20:49.191
I narced because he made me!

01:20:49.193 --> 01:20:51.226
How? How did he even know?

01:20:51.228 --> 01:20:54.495
Because when I found out that
I wasn't invited to your party

01:20:54.497 --> 01:20:58.767
it hurt me so very deep,
that I threw up really hard.

01:20:58.769 --> 01:21:01.337
Why didn't you invite me?

01:21:03.173 --> 01:21:05.540
(SQUEALS) Why?

01:21:05.542 --> 01:21:07.808
I was kind and clean!

01:21:07.810 --> 01:21:09.343
And I got mostly B's!

01:21:09.345 --> 01:21:10.611
I know, I cheated off you.

01:21:10.613 --> 01:21:13.482
And then you decided that I was a "no."

01:21:13.484 --> 01:21:16.585

decided that I was a "no"!

01:21:16.587 --> 01:21:19.955

decided that I was a "no"?

01:21:21.524 --> 01:21:23.592
Me.

01:21:23.594 --> 01:21:29.531
So, I have decided that
tonight I deserve to be here.

01:21:29.533 --> 01:21:33.268
Tonight, I am a "yes."

01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:35.937

I am a "fuck to the yeah"!

01:21:49.286 --> 01:21:50.384
No.

01:21:50.386 --> 01:21:52.787
The saddest part

01:21:52.789 --> 01:21:55.691
is that you and I used to
have a blast in grade school.

01:21:55.693 --> 01:21:58.259
And we would probably still be friends

01:21:58.261 --> 01:22:01.330

You lying mofos!

01:35:48.824 --> 01:35:50.424
I'm gonna kill you.

01:35:50.426 --> 01:35:52.692
Stop it. Stop it! We are fed up.

01:35:52.694 --> 01:35:54.594
We have no energy for this goddamn shit.

- Smell that armpit.
- DEANNA: Stop!

01:35:56.599 --> 01:35:58.665
Our whole house looks like
Pompeii, and you two are wrestling?

01:35:58.667 --> 01:36:00.268
I'll tell you what.

01:36:00.270 --> 01:36:03.170
Since we're all finally
telling the goddamn truth,

01:36:03.172 --> 01:36:04.571
here's our truth.

01:36:04.573 --> 01:36:07.442
And we mean this from
the bottom of our hearts.

01:36:07.444 --> 01:36:11.111
We are so tired of the both of you.

We're so tired. We really are.

01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:15.750
You know, everybody always said to us...

01:36:15.752 --> 01:36:19.853
"Enjoy your kids while they're
young because it goes so fast."

01:36:19.855 --> 01:36:22.389
I don't know what the fuck
they were talking about,

01:36:22.391 --> 01:36:25.159
because it seems like we'll never be done.

01:36:25.161 --> 01:36:27.661
We keep trying to pass you the baton.

01:36:27.663 --> 01:36:29.397
You won't take it.

01:36:29.399 --> 01:36:30.764
Take it!

01:36:30.766 --> 01:36:34.802
Just take the fucking baton!

01:36:34.804 --> 01:36:37.772
I agree. We all think you
should take the baton, Kate.

01:36:37.774 --> 01:36:39.740
Maura, cut the shit.
We're talking to you, too.

01:36:39.742 --> 01:36:41.776

- Yeah.

01:36:50.119 --> 01:36:51.852
- We know!
- Yeah. We interrupted one of your day-bangs.

01:36:54.823 --> 01:36:57.458
I want a different village,

before when my condo sankholed.

01:37:25.521 --> 01:37:27.321
I'm gonna talk you through it.

that a house is a building

(SIGHS) I blew it with him.

01:45:34.176 --> 01:45:35.942
No, he's still asking about you.

01:45:35.944 --> 01:45:37.244
- He is?
- Yeah.

01:45:37.246 --> 01:45:38.911
He is the greatest.

01:45:38.913 --> 01:45:40.246
James just needs some...

01:45:40.248 --> 01:45:42.116
No! Stop deciding what other people need.

01:45:42.118 --> 01:45:45.321
You need help. Let him help you.

01:45:47.023 --> 01:45:49.656
I got to go scrub "I heart
balls" off the fridge.

01:45:49.658 --> 01:45:51.325
I'm sorry I wrote that.

01:45:51.327 --> 01:45:54.294
- Wait!
- Mmm.

01:45:54.296 --> 01:45:56.429
What do I do when I see him?

01:45:56.431 --> 01:45:59.866
See, I'm asking for help already.

01:45:59.868 --> 01:46:02.068
Find a way to make him come to you.

01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:04.138
But go big.

01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:06.509
Make it clear that you need him.

01:46:16.185 --> 01:46:19.186
MAURA: Help!

01:46:19.188 --> 01:46:21.457
Help!

01:46:32.967 --> 01:46:35.470
Help.

01:46:37.372 --> 01:46:39.973
I know you used to be a lifeguard.

01:46:39.975 --> 01:46:41.977
I need it.

01:46:45.146 --> 01:46:47.082
Save me, please!

01:46:59.328 --> 01:47:01.027
Oh, my God.

01:47:01.029 --> 01:47:02.196
I'm drowning.

01:47:02.198 --> 01:47:03.897
Don't die.

01:47:03.899 --> 01:47:05.701
Come here.

01:47:14.342 --> 01:47:17.910
Water feels good on my ballerina hole.

01:47:17.912 --> 01:47:19.746
(SIGHS)

01:47:19.748 --> 01:47:22.014
- What about your dick burns?
- Ooh.

01:47:22.016 --> 01:47:24.652
Nice to meet you, Dick Burns.

01:47:33.863 --> 01:47:35.831
(TRUCK BEEPING)

01:47:39.234 --> 01:47:40.902
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:48:00.122 --> 01:48:02.889
How in the hell did you pull this off?

01:48:02.891 --> 01:48:07.028
Well, I usually give 30% and I
went for the full 100 this time.

01:48:08.096 --> 01:48:11.397
You might need one more coat.

01:48:11.399 --> 01:48:14.268
What?

01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:16.303
There we go.

01:48:16.305 --> 01:48:18.972
- Thanks for doing this.
- Oh, well...

01:48:18.974 --> 01:48:20.574
Thank you for bringing me Dave.

01:48:20.576 --> 01:48:23.242
He's really quite the tender love maker.

01:48:23.244 --> 01:48:25.077
So, this is awesome.

01:48:25.079 --> 01:48:26.179
Come on, girlfriend.

01:48:26.181 --> 01:48:27.683
Dave has chlamydia.

01:48:28.818 --> 01:48:30.586
Right, friendship.

01:48:40.429 --> 01:48:43.229
Mom, this guy wants to know if
he can get 10% off his manicure

01:48:43.231 --> 01:48:45.031
because he only has nine fingers.

01:48:45.033 --> 01:48:47.267
Hang up. It's your grandpa pranking us.

01:48:47.269 --> 01:48:48.968
Nice try, Gramps.

01:48:48.970 --> 01:48:51.405
Gross! Get a room!

01:48:51.407 --> 01:48:52.873
Ah, you know you love it.

01:48:52.875 --> 01:48:53.840
- (CHUCKLES)
- KATE: It's 10:00!

01:48:53.842 --> 01:48:55.275
Champagne time.

01:48:55.277 --> 01:48:56.543
JAMES: I'm gonna do this every week.

01:48:56.545 --> 01:48:58.845
- Hae-Won, you're incredible.
- Thank you, Jack.

01:48:58.847 --> 01:49:00.112
- High five!
- No.

01:49:00.114 --> 01:49:02.449
- Sorry.
- All right, everybody, gather up.

01:49:02.451 --> 01:49:06.018
On behalf of my co-owner
Hae-Won and myself.

01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:07.854
- Yay!
- Thank you, Alex,

01:49:07.856 --> 01:49:09.322
for investing in our dreams.

01:49:09.324 --> 01:49:11.258
Just here to do my part. (CHUCKLES)

01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:12.425
Whoa! Hair part! (LAUGHING)

01:49:12.427 --> 01:49:13.492
Oh, God. Here we go.

Yoinks! (CHUCKLES)

01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:17.030
There is a lid for every pot. (CHUCKLES)

01:49:17.032 --> 01:49:18.464
I'm gonna punch him right in the dick.

01:49:18.466 --> 01:49:21.268
Let's do this! (SQUEALS)

01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:22.535
MAURA: Merry Christmas.

01:49:22.537 --> 01:49:24.303
- Haley, you ready?
- HALEY: I'm coming!

01:49:24.305 --> 01:49:26.875
Hello! Hi.

01:49:29.011 --> 01:49:32.245
Merry Christmas, my two angel.

01:49:32.247 --> 01:49:34.348
And welcome to your new home! (CHUCKLES)

(KIDS LAUGH)

01:49:35.516 --> 01:49:38.218
Come on, let's go pick a room!

01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:39.486
Really?

01:49:39.488 --> 01:49:42.488
- No, wheelie.
- (LAUGHS)

01:49:42.490 --> 01:49:46.526
If this doesn't smell like our
Christmas, I will flip a table.

01:49:46.528 --> 01:49:48.227
DEANNA: Hi!

01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:49.662
Oh, hi!

01:49:49.664 --> 01:49:51.565
- BUCKY: All right, hi!
- DEANNA: Oh, come here.

01:49:51.567 --> 01:49:55.067
- DEANNA: Look at you.
- JAMES: No, look at you. Look at you.

01:49:55.069 --> 01:49:57.169
DEANNA: Cookies!

01:49:57.171 --> 01:50:00.273
- Oh, how beautiful! Look at these!
- JAMES: They're store-bought.

01:50:00.275 --> 01:50:01.575
Good to see you. Good to
see you. Good to see you.

01:50:01.577 --> 01:50:03.110
- Did you make these?
- No.

01:50:03.112 --> 01:50:06.045
No, I bought them at a gas station.

01:50:06.047 --> 01:50:08.048
Still feels like our Christmas.

01:50:08.050 --> 01:50:09.383
Yeah.

01:50:09.385 --> 01:50:11.687
Because we're the home.

01:50:13.655 --> 01:50:15.988
Yeah.

01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:17.693
Come here, bootch.

01:50:25.301 --> 01:50:28.337

- Okay.

- Sorry. Bloopers!
- MAN: Yeah.

Whoo! Hey, I put in a special
request for our Applebutt...

Hey, I... Fuck me, sorry. Fuck, sorry.

01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:26.727
- Can I try it again?
- Ellis I... Sure.

01:51:26.729 --> 01:51:28.428
- MAN: Let's try again.
- Sorry.

01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:29.696
Oh, you probably don't remember.

01:51:29.698 --> 01:51:32.232
Oh, I remember.

01:51:32.234 --> 01:51:35.302
Oh, I remember. I don't remember.

01:51:35.304 --> 01:51:38.104
My safe word is "Dow
Jones Industrial Average."

01:51:38.106 --> 01:51:40.173
My safe word is "geopolitical disaster."

01:51:40.175 --> 01:51:42.509
My safe word is "pseudoparathyroidism."

that cum-guzzling road whore.

Good job. Now I put it in your head, sorry.
