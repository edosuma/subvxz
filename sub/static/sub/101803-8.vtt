00:04.091 --> 00:07.355
<i>Previously on</i><i>
What did your captors employ</i>

00:07.398 --> 00:09.052
-<i>during captivity?
Icepicks. Power tools.</i>

00:09.096 --> 00:10.706
But warriors, we want
to keep serving the best way

00:10.749 --> 00:12.447
<i>we know how,
people act like we're addicts.</i>

00:12.490 --> 00:14.057
That was my friend Hannah.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.102
<i>When I was in Texas,</i>

00:15.145 --> 00:16.755
we became more than friends.

00:16.799 --> 00:19.323
If we decide to make this real,
one of us needs

00:19.367 --> 00:22.500
-to leave Bravo.
-I could consider going
to another team.

00:22.544 --> 00:24.154
<i>Maybe you're not regressing</i>

00:24.198 --> 00:25.764
<i>if you're returning to
something that you love.</i>

00:25.808 --> 00:27.723
My replacement, Lieutenant Soto.

00:27.766 --> 00:30.204
Something tells me that Soto
isn't really the sit-back type.

00:30.247 --> 00:32.075
It's a new day
and a new Bravo, gentlemen.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.294
<i>Warriors, they weren't meant</i>

00:33.337 --> 00:34.904
<i>to survive the battlefield.</i>

00:34.947 --> 00:36.471
<i>I quit the one job
that I ever loved.</i>

00:36.514 --> 00:37.907
<i>Been expecting you
to walk in here</i>

00:37.950 --> 00:39.430
since I learned
I'm losing Natalie

00:39.474 --> 00:41.128
-to San Diego.
-Sir, I've identified

00:41.171 --> 00:43.391
the one job that makes me want
to get up in the morning.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.262
And what job
is that?

00:45.306 --> 00:47.308
Being Bravo 1 again.

00:49.005 --> 00:51.268
Well, crushed
that diving package.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.270
Safely say that Bravo is back.

00:53.314 --> 00:55.272
Team's never moved so fast
in the water.

00:55.316 --> 00:57.274
Even with Sonny checking his six
every three seconds.

00:57.318 --> 00:59.494
You know, I'll tell you what,
I think he was moving that fast

00:59.537 --> 01:01.496
because of the shark
-in the water.
-Oh, God!

01:01.539 --> 01:02.845
Yeah, won't be laughing

01:02.888 --> 01:04.586
when that shark's got
you in his jaws.

01:04.629 --> 01:07.197
Yeah, I just don't understand
why we're doing all this diving

01:07.241 --> 01:09.765
for that one lake
in Afghanistan.

01:09.808 --> 01:12.855
Well, so much for your promise
to never complain again

01:12.898 --> 01:15.466
after Jace came back and
Thirty returned to Charlie.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.990
Well ...!

01:18.034 --> 01:19.992
Now that Ray's been cleared hot,

01:20.036 --> 01:21.385
I am itching

01:21.429 --> 01:22.908
to stop training and
get back to fighting.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.258
Makes two of us, brother.

01:24.301 --> 01:25.998
I know Jace is feeling the same

01:26.042 --> 01:27.826
after all those hoops
Lindell made him jump through

01:27.870 --> 01:29.219
to get back to Bravo 1.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.134
Let's go.

01:32.135 --> 01:34.485
-What the hell is this?
Bravo Team's

01:34.529 --> 01:36.052
next three months.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.836
Starting with mandatory
NeLs tomorrow.
Whew!

01:37.880 --> 01:39.795
Mandatory means mandatory.

01:39.838 --> 01:41.144
Wow, look at these colors.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.624
Navy eLearning.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.191
Nope, it's not gonna work.

01:44.234 --> 01:45.627
We don't fight
behind a computer.

01:45.670 --> 01:48.456
Besides, I want us working
on CQC training.

01:48.499 --> 01:50.632
Seems we disagree,
Master Chief.

01:50.675 --> 01:53.287
Again. Learning curve
as you and I figure out

01:53.330 --> 01:55.158
how to work together
is getting a little long.

01:55.202 --> 01:57.204
Well, you know what,
you'll get used to it.

01:57.247 --> 02:00.903
See, Bravo has a... a way
of doing things around here,

02:00.946 --> 02:02.252
and they work.

02:02.296 --> 02:04.428
Well, I'm here
to keep you working.

02:04.472 --> 02:06.126
Trust the process.

02:09.825 --> 02:11.957
It's kind of cool to see it
all laid out like this,

02:12.001 --> 02:13.785
-color coded.
-Yeah, includes

02:13.829 --> 02:15.439
actual breaks.

02:15.483 --> 02:18.616
It's nice for those of us
who have stuff outside of work.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.096
Yeah.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.838
Brock, hey, let's go hit
the shooting range, huh?

02:22.881 --> 02:24.274
Knock off that rust, see if you

02:24.318 --> 02:25.493
can still shoot straight there,
cowboy.

02:25.536 --> 02:27.538
Eh, Metal's got me, man. Thanks.

02:27.582 --> 02:29.192
Metal has you?

02:29.236 --> 02:31.194
If he's looking for something
to do, let him join you.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.718
Otherwise, he's
gonna make you go diving again.

02:33.762 --> 02:36.460
And again. And again.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.245
That's all right, man,
I got plenty to do.

02:38.288 --> 02:40.203
I'll give some muster to
the cake-eaters,
that's what I'll do.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.205
Oh, uh, actually, we're good.
I've been doing that

02:42.249 --> 02:44.294
since you left.
Is that right?

02:47.036 --> 02:48.864
You got to be kidding me.
Do you believe these guys?

02:48.907 --> 02:50.779
That's all right--
we know what's best
for the team.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.955
Tell you what,
unified front to Soto.

02:52.998 --> 02:54.478
We got this.

02:55.610 --> 03:00.092
Hey, brother, you know,
now that I'm warrant, I...

03:00.136 --> 03:03.400
I can't really check
a fellow officer like that.

03:03.444 --> 03:06.186
Besides, I don't have time--
I'm, uh, leaving for Jordan

03:06.229 --> 03:08.623
as soon as I swing by the house
and kiss the kids goodbye.

03:08.666 --> 03:10.233
-Your S.A. assignment?
-Yeah.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.192
Thought that wasn't
for another two weeks.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.236
Yeah, plans changed.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.543
Well, must be something big.

03:15.586 --> 03:18.372
Jace, you know you're not
cleared for details, brother.

03:18.415 --> 03:20.591
B-Besides, uh,
I only found out this morning.

03:20.635 --> 03:23.464
I didn't want to split focus
from the diving FTX.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.466
Something's off with the team.

03:25.509 --> 03:27.468
Doesn't seem right.

03:27.511 --> 03:28.643
Like Sonny said,
everybody wants

03:28.686 --> 03:30.340
to get back to it,
me especially.

03:30.384 --> 03:33.474
I get it. Just wish you
were rolling with Bravo, is all.

03:34.605 --> 03:36.564
Hey, it's the first time
I'm heading out

03:36.607 --> 03:39.001
as warrant officer
since you been back.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.481
There's bound to be
some growing pains

03:40.524 --> 03:41.917
while we get used to
the new Bravo, right?

03:47.923 --> 03:49.359
"The new Bravo."

04:06.158 --> 04:07.943
Hi.

04:07.986 --> 04:09.858
So much
for the guard dog.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.468
Looks like I'm gonna need
a new one.

04:11.512 --> 04:13.209
Least one old dog learned
the new trick

04:13.253 --> 04:14.993
of enjoying retirement.

04:15.037 --> 04:16.604
Aren't you supposed
to be in, like,

04:16.647 --> 04:18.214
music theory class
on Friday?

04:18.258 --> 04:20.303
Canceled.
Professor wanted to get a jump

04:20.347 --> 04:21.696
on the week-long break.

04:21.739 --> 04:24.220
So I decided
to come see

04:24.264 --> 04:26.222
-how you're holding up.
-Holding up?

04:26.266 --> 04:27.832
You left your job,

04:27.876 --> 04:30.835
and Natalie went
to San Diego without you.

04:30.879 --> 04:33.664
Most people would
spin out after that.

04:33.708 --> 04:36.319
-I'm not most people.
-I know,

04:36.363 --> 04:38.626
but you were closer
than you used to be.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.106
It feels like
an actual home.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.369
I mean, all
the furniture

04:42.412 --> 04:43.848
is in one piece.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.241
Natalie was a good influence.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.765
So, what are you
not trying to say here?

04:47.809 --> 04:49.767
I'm saying that
I like this.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.987
Okay, you like this.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.423
And I liked you
with Natalie,

04:53.467 --> 04:54.946
because I knew
you were happy,

04:54.990 --> 04:56.644
but now that you're
back with the team

04:56.687 --> 04:58.298
at your old job, I just...

04:58.341 --> 05:00.343
wonder if it all goes back
to how it was.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.302
Not going back to how it was,
I'm not spinning out,

05:02.345 --> 05:04.347
not going backwards.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.218
Yet.
Yet?

05:06.262 --> 05:08.786
All these changes, you think
they'll survive you operating?

05:10.832 --> 05:12.268
Dad? I'm sorry.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.965
You plan on spending
your whole break here,

05:14.009 --> 05:15.053
checking up on me?

05:15.097 --> 05:16.446
Yep.

05:16.490 --> 05:19.449
How about a little privacy
right now, okay?

05:21.233 --> 05:23.410
It's not my first day
of school, babe.

05:23.453 --> 05:25.063
You don't have to worry.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.717
You were up again
last night.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.807
Got thirsty.
I wanted some water.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.809
You know you
won't scare me, right?

05:31.853 --> 05:33.637
With the details.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.073
I survived and made it home.

05:35.117 --> 05:36.684
Those are the only details
that matter.

05:38.120 --> 05:41.166
I can handle whatever
you're comfortable sharing.

05:41.210 --> 05:43.604
I'll be comfortable
with getting back to work.

05:43.647 --> 05:46.215
Just... just glad
the day's finally here.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.743
Hey. I will never understand

05:52.787 --> 05:55.442
that instinct
to run back into a fight.

05:56.704 --> 05:59.750
Babe, when someone flatlines
in the ER, what do you do?

05:59.794 --> 06:02.492
-You pack it in?
-It's not the same.

06:02.536 --> 06:05.365
You're the first Navy SEAL
to be captured.

06:05.408 --> 06:08.368
And I've been
trained to handle all this.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.327
You're leaving again?

06:13.416 --> 06:16.201
Yes, ma'am, and I
-will miss you every day.
-Last time

06:16.245 --> 06:17.725
you left, you got hurt.

06:19.117 --> 06:20.902
Come here.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.777
Look...

06:26.821 --> 06:29.476
I know the last few months
have been confusing and scary.

06:29.519 --> 06:32.609
I mean, it's okay
to be worried.

06:33.915 --> 06:35.917
But you want to know
what one of my favorite things

06:35.960 --> 06:37.092
about my job is?

06:37.135 --> 06:38.833
What?

06:38.876 --> 06:41.401
It gives me lots of chances
to be brave.

06:41.444 --> 06:44.055
And this is a
chance for you

06:44.099 --> 06:46.144
to be brave, too.

06:46.188 --> 06:47.842
Can you do that?

06:47.885 --> 06:50.801
Are you leaving
because you have to go...

06:50.845 --> 06:53.282
or because you want to go?

06:53.325 --> 06:56.416
Baby girl...

06:56.459 --> 06:59.157
you know I would never
willingly leave you, don't you?

07:00.463 --> 07:02.987
We'll be brave together.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.299
Come on.

07:18.873 --> 07:20.570
Hey.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.616
I'm heading to the gym.
-You want to come?
-Did you know

07:22.659 --> 07:25.401
that Echo's done two JCETs
in Panama in the last year?

07:25.445 --> 07:27.185
I did not, but...

07:27.229 --> 07:29.492
what the hell has that got to do
with you coming to the gym?

07:29.536 --> 07:32.452
Echo Team's intel officer's duty
assignment is up in a month,

07:32.495 --> 07:35.150
and... I put in my application.

07:35.193 --> 07:37.457
Ooh. Okay. Uh...

07:40.547 --> 07:43.375
Well, your stock is skyrocketing
at Command.

07:43.419 --> 07:46.422
You sure you want to cash it in
for a lateral move?

07:46.466 --> 07:49.294
It's the best way to
clear a path for us.

07:49.338 --> 07:51.035
And...

07:51.079 --> 07:53.951
I know that it's a lot
to throw at the guys,

07:53.995 --> 07:56.519
so I could use your help
figuring how to tell them

07:56.563 --> 08:00.131
that I'm leaving Bravo...
and we're together.

08:00.175 --> 08:02.046
It's simple-- just tell them
you got a new job,

08:02.090 --> 08:03.918
and then you and I will get
a little frisky

08:03.961 --> 08:05.528
in front of them. Yeah.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.791
Sonny, it's hard enough
being taken seriously

08:07.835 --> 08:09.358
as a woman in this job.

08:09.401 --> 08:11.447
The last thing that I need
is people thinking

08:11.491 --> 08:13.667
that I changed my assignment
for a guy.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.538
No, the team
doesn't think like that.

08:15.582 --> 08:18.715
If you're happy,
they're gonna be happy for you.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.891
Clay and Ray were
last time.

08:20.935 --> 08:23.851
-What, Clay knew, too?
-That's my point.

08:23.894 --> 08:26.375
Nobody saw or treated you
different, did they?

08:26.418 --> 08:28.769
No. Lisa...

08:28.812 --> 08:31.423
you got to stop looking
for the clouds...

08:31.467 --> 08:34.339
'cause there ain't nothing
but <i>Sonny</i> skies ahead.

08:40.868 --> 08:43.740
Hope we didn't wake
all the neighbors up.

08:43.784 --> 08:46.874
With these paper-thin walls?
Are you kidding me?

08:49.441 --> 08:51.966
Oh, speaking of which...

08:52.009 --> 08:54.795
what-what happened
to Jazzercize?

08:54.838 --> 08:55.926
What?

08:55.970 --> 08:57.319
Jazzercise.

08:57.362 --> 08:59.277
Oh, come on, Jazzercise lady

08:59.321 --> 09:02.324
who used to wake us up every
morning with her workouts?

09:02.367 --> 09:04.718
Oh...

09:04.761 --> 09:06.589
She, um...

09:06.633 --> 09:09.157
-she moved.
-What?

09:09.200 --> 09:11.333
Yeah, like, to...

09:11.376 --> 09:12.726
I think, like...

09:12.769 --> 09:14.641
-Omaha, maybe?
-Really?

09:14.684 --> 09:16.425
-Yeah.
-Oh.

09:16.468 --> 09:17.774
Oh, man.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.036
Hmm.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.342
Did I do that?

09:20.385 --> 09:21.822
No, I...

09:21.865 --> 09:23.954
I tweaked it training.
Jace has been pushing us

09:23.998 --> 09:25.956
-pretty hard.
-I can't believe
he's back.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.959
After everything he sacrificed,
you know,

09:29.003 --> 09:31.832
not being able to move on to a
new chapter seems a little sad.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.877
Nothing wrong
-with embracing who you are.
-No, not at all,

09:33.921 --> 09:35.575
but you said yourself he had,
you know,

09:35.618 --> 09:37.577
-good reason to step away.
-Yeah, just...

09:37.620 --> 09:40.101
I guess he... found
a better reason to come back.

09:40.144 --> 09:42.364
After everything
that Ray went through,

09:42.407 --> 09:44.366
and Blackburn getting promoted,

09:44.409 --> 09:45.715
team needs him.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.804
Team's always gonna need him.

09:49.066 --> 09:50.633
You can't fault somebody
for returning

09:50.677 --> 09:52.113
to something they love.

09:52.156 --> 09:53.680
It's the same thing I'm doing.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.507
Yeah, sure, but, you know,
at some point

09:55.551 --> 09:57.161
it can become unhealthy for him.

09:57.205 --> 09:58.641
When is that, exactly?

09:58.685 --> 10:00.338
When he's just repeating
a broken pattern,

10:00.382 --> 10:02.253
you know, doing the same thing
over and over again,

10:02.297 --> 10:03.515
expecting a different result.

10:05.822 --> 10:08.433
You think that's
what we're doing?

10:10.697 --> 10:13.830
No.

10:13.874 --> 10:15.832
I think that we're
very different people

10:15.876 --> 10:17.878
than we were last time around.

10:17.921 --> 10:20.489
There's hope for us.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.101
Okay?

10:25.799 --> 10:27.757
One more.

11:01.095 --> 11:04.228
I recommend the house blend
with sage.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.752
I'm actually more
of a coffee man.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.101
Then let's get you some.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.668
Hmm.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.931
Nice to finally meet you,
Warrant Officer Perry.

11:10.974 --> 11:13.194
Excited to be working
with you, Mina.

11:13.237 --> 11:14.674
I assume that shop
is connected

11:14.717 --> 11:16.153
to the missing weapons
we're looking for,

11:16.197 --> 11:19.113
unless that armed man
I saw was a coincidence.

11:19.156 --> 11:22.072
Oh, good eye.
The arms dealers we're tracking

11:22.116 --> 11:24.901
go there to wheel and deal
the old-fashioned way.

11:24.945 --> 11:27.512
Hmm.
The owner, my asset,

11:27.556 --> 11:30.428
records them and signals me
when it's time to collect.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.082
That's pretty risky
on the owner's part.

11:32.126 --> 11:34.868
Well, like most refugees,
she's seen more danger in a day

11:34.911 --> 11:37.000
than most people can handle
in a lifetime.

11:37.044 --> 11:38.828
I handled some
of that danger for her once

11:38.872 --> 11:41.788
and this is how
she pays me back.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.441
All right.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.752
-Ugh.
You need a second

11:49.796 --> 11:51.841
to settle in,
call your family?

11:51.885 --> 11:54.975
Uh, no, you know,
we already started.

11:55.018 --> 11:56.846
-Let's keep at it.
-All right.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.769
There a reason you're not
with the rest of Bravo

12:06.813 --> 12:07.988
working on the NeLs?

12:08.031 --> 12:09.641
Yeah. Yeah, there is a reason.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.600
Reason is you need to learn
how Bravo works

12:11.643 --> 12:14.081
before you start messing
with my system.

12:14.124 --> 12:17.388
Your system left this team
undeployable without you.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.739
It's my job to make sure
Bravo can run in top form

12:19.782 --> 12:21.871
with or without Jason Hayes.

12:23.830 --> 12:27.355
Look, if the Bravo you came
back to feels different,

12:27.398 --> 12:29.096
-it's because I want it to be.
-You want it to be?

12:29.139 --> 12:30.619
Yeah.
Yeah?

12:30.662 --> 12:33.274
This team will not be
dependent on one person.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.015
Let me explain something to you.
Every team needs a leader,

12:35.058 --> 12:36.233
and I'm that leader.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.582
No one's
disputing that.

12:37.626 --> 12:38.845
But your teammates
are stepping up

12:38.888 --> 12:40.281
and Ray's now a warrant officer,

12:40.324 --> 12:42.326
so your role
has changed.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.981
You don't have to carry
as much of the load anymore.

12:45.025 --> 12:48.898
So enjoy the new Bravo.
You've earned it.

13:07.743 --> 13:10.485
We've been playing for a week
and this is all you've learned.

13:10.528 --> 13:13.444
Corps of Engineers
has my team out every day

13:13.488 --> 13:15.838
putting up these wells,
Ibrahim. I'm tired.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.666
Because you return
to an empty home, my friend.

13:17.709 --> 13:20.234
What is a man if he has
no family to work for?

13:20.277 --> 13:22.062
He's someone who keeps
things simple.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.979
Working and living
without anyone

13:26.022 --> 13:28.764
looking over his shoulder.

13:28.808 --> 13:32.333
Turn your receiver
ten degrees to the right.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.737
Boom.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.262
Gold at the end of the rainbow.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.394
We've got I.P. addresses,
e-mails and GPS locations

13:50.438 --> 13:51.613
coming in.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.359
Another game, Ray?

13:59.882 --> 14:01.492
Ray?

14:03.930 --> 14:05.540
Another game?

14:05.583 --> 14:08.630
You know what,
let's run it back, Ibrahim.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.545
Feel like my losing streak's
coming to an end.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.416
Perhaps.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.554
How was work?

14:19.597 --> 14:21.338
How was work? After a
week of online courses,

14:21.382 --> 14:22.905
I don't want to see
another computer screen.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.080
Just put it away, will ya?

14:24.124 --> 14:25.516
I'm leaving to meet Laura.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.170
You'll have
a screen-free zone soon.

14:27.214 --> 14:29.172
No, seriously,
just put it away.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.044
Come on. Let's ...d, I, um...

14:33.611 --> 14:35.396
"Transfer
application."

14:36.397 --> 14:38.007
I thought you loved NYU.

14:38.051 --> 14:40.096
I did. I-I do.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.837
It's just ...u did or you do?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.317
I-I do. Uh ...at is it?

14:43.360 --> 14:45.101
-Megan and Haley both left.
-Yeah.

14:45.145 --> 14:48.365
And the auditions are
way more competitive this year.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.715
I-I have to be better than,
like, a hundred other girls.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.282
Well, you are.
I've heard you.

14:52.326 --> 14:53.980
You're just saying that
'cause you're my dad.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.285
No, I'm saying it because
it's true. It's different.

14:55.329 --> 14:58.288
Well, it doesn't feel that way.

14:58.332 --> 14:59.942
I'm not gonna let you quit
because it's hard.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.510
Sure. It's not like
you'd know anything about that.

15:02.553 --> 15:03.946
-What's that supposed to mean?
-It means I'm not

15:03.990 --> 15:05.730
just thinking about myself here.

15:05.774 --> 15:08.342
If I transfer,
I-I could be closer to home.

15:08.385 --> 15:09.996
Stop with being
closer to home, okay?

15:10.039 --> 15:11.998
You've been here
all week, okay?

15:12.041 --> 15:12.999
You've seen me here.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.000
I am fine.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.305
Fine ...s.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.785
...isn't blowing up
a good relationship

15:16.828 --> 15:18.395
and quitting your job
just so you could go back

15:18.439 --> 15:20.006
to the only place
you've ever felt comfortable.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.572
I'm sorry, don't you have
a friend named Laura

15:21.616 --> 15:22.922
you need to go see
-right about now?
-Yeah.

15:29.450 --> 15:32.322
I'm still not so sure
about you rolling with Echo.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.498
I mean, of all the teams,
Davis, come on.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.239
Are you jealous

15:36.283 --> 15:38.850
of me hanging out
-with other operators?
-No. No.

15:38.894 --> 15:41.114
-Is that what's happening here?
-No! No, no, no, no.
Sonny Quinn don't get jealous.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.985
Mm.
Okay? I don't.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.205
I don't. I mean,
those guys are so dull,

15:45.248 --> 15:47.555
they make Brock
look like Rip Taylor.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.950
Echo is the play.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.952
Since-since Jason
and Ray are back,

15:52.995 --> 15:54.301
there's no way that
you're leaving Bravo.

15:54.344 --> 15:55.955
-This is good for us.
-Yeah. It is, right?

15:55.998 --> 15:57.086
Yes.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.088
Okay. Got to ride
that gravy train

15:59.132 --> 16:00.394
with biscuit wheels.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.618
Oh, look who it is.

16:07.662 --> 16:08.837
Oh! Hey!

16:08.880 --> 16:10.099
What's going on here?

16:10.143 --> 16:12.928
Uh, you know,
I actually have to go, uh,

16:12.972 --> 16:15.278
make room for, uh,
more drinks...

16:15.322 --> 16:17.063
-...since you showed up.
-Ew. You're gross.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.325
-Pull the tail.
-Bye.

16:18.368 --> 16:19.108
-I'm feeling it tonight!
-Pull the tail.

16:20.718 --> 16:21.806
Thank you, babe.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.375
You guys are...

16:25.419 --> 16:27.116
you guys
are really doing this again?

16:27.160 --> 16:29.031
-Doing what?
-Come on.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.642
After your DRB,
Sonny getting banished to Texas,

16:31.686 --> 16:33.731
you guys can't afford
to get in any more trouble.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.907
We're not gonna get in trouble
this time.

16:35.951 --> 16:37.170
It's...

16:38.475 --> 16:41.652
I'm... transferring to Echo.

16:41.696 --> 16:43.002
You're what?

16:43.045 --> 16:44.481
What about-- what about Bravo?

16:44.525 --> 16:46.135
I mean, what-what are
we gonna do without you?

16:46.179 --> 16:49.008
I'm-- I think
what Clay is trying to say

16:49.051 --> 16:50.792
is that you look very happy
and congratulations.

16:50.835 --> 16:52.533
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

16:52.576 --> 16:56.319
I'm just trying to avoid
the same mistakes as last time.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.147
Yeah.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.891
H-Honestly, I'm...

17:02.934 --> 17:03.979
I'm impressed.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.199
I am.
I never thought

17:06.242 --> 17:07.809
that I'd see
Sonny commit to anything

17:07.852 --> 17:09.071
other than being a frogman.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.638
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.509
I am gonna miss you
though.

17:12.553 --> 17:14.294
It's not like you're
never gonna see each other.

17:14.337 --> 17:15.643
We can double-date.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.384
Right?
Yes.

17:17.427 --> 17:20.126
Oh, or we can go
on a couples vacation.

17:20.169 --> 17:23.172
Th-There, there is a thought.

17:23.216 --> 17:24.521
Right?

17:24.565 --> 17:25.435
Oh, it's definitely
a thought.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.046
Totally.
Yeah, I mean,

17:27.089 --> 17:28.438
with Sonny and Stella there,
we're gonna hit

17:28.482 --> 17:30.179
both ends
of the culture spectrum. Right?

17:30.223 --> 17:32.181
I mean, museums by day,

17:32.225 --> 17:33.878
-the red-light district by night.
God.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.576
My favorite, the
-red-light district.
-Let's...

17:35.619 --> 17:37.186
let-let's start
-with a round.
-Totally. Oh, yeah.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.231
-Yeah?
-Ooh, yeah.

17:38.274 --> 17:40.189
Yeah.
Thank you.

17:41.756 --> 17:44.063
Will you do me
a favor and just,

17:44.106 --> 17:46.630
uh, keep this to yourselves
until it's official, please?

17:46.674 --> 17:49.329
Um... it'd be nice
to cross the finish line

17:49.372 --> 17:50.547
without any speed bumps.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.897
I promise.
We won't say anything.

17:52.941 --> 17:54.899
Thank you.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.861
Seriously though,
you and I used to talk

17:59.904 --> 18:02.820
about going on a real vacation
all the time, and we never did.

18:02.864 --> 18:04.909
So why don't
we plan one?

18:04.953 --> 18:08.130
Refundable deposits in case
you get spun up and everything.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.045
I know the uncertainty
isn't easy.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.264
It's not.

18:11.307 --> 18:14.136
But it's not a
deal-breaker, right?

18:14.180 --> 18:18.009
We can cancel and rebook it
a hundred times if we needed.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.403
It'd just be
really nice to have something

18:20.447 --> 18:22.144
to look forward to together.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.537
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

18:23.580 --> 18:24.799
Yeah.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.192
Mm.

18:26.235 --> 18:27.671
What's this regular
Sunday night trip

18:27.715 --> 18:29.847
he makes to Daraa?

18:29.891 --> 18:31.414
His mother
lives there.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.112
Family dinner, maybe?

18:34.330 --> 18:35.940
Check his e-mails.

18:35.984 --> 18:38.247
These guys are never as sly
as they want to be.

18:42.599 --> 18:44.035
I heard an operator

18:44.079 --> 18:46.473
on an S.A. assignment
was captured and escaped.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.083
Know anything about that?

18:48.127 --> 18:50.303
Sounds like an urban myth to me.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.305
Maybe.

18:53.306 --> 18:55.525
But there's always
a little truth to a myth.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.701
Heard he's back in the field,
-too.
-Yeah.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.921
Well, his partner on that op
wasn't as lucky.

19:01.836 --> 19:04.534
We got imagery
on that Sunday night GPS data?

19:04.578 --> 19:06.188
Yeah.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.016
It's...

19:09.409 --> 19:11.367
Take a look at this.

19:12.673 --> 19:14.283
What do we got?

19:14.327 --> 19:16.894
Hoping that's not
his mom's house.

19:18.635 --> 19:21.160
We've got our target.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.074
Let's get an
assault team out here.

19:23.118 --> 19:24.250
Copy.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.515
Come on. That's it. Let's go.

19:30.952 --> 19:33.172
How 'bout some water, huh?
All right.

19:34.216 --> 19:35.391
Look at this, huh?

19:35.435 --> 19:37.480
Come here. Cerby.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.272
Thanks for, uh,

19:46.315 --> 19:48.926
telling me that you spent
the night at Laura's last night.

19:48.970 --> 19:51.451
Didn't need you spinning up
Bravo to search for me.

19:51.494 --> 19:52.669
Look, I'm sorry.

19:52.713 --> 19:53.888
Probably should've
handled it

19:53.931 --> 19:55.237
a lot better
yesterday

19:55.281 --> 19:56.586
but not one of
my strong suits.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.240
I just want
to make sure

19:58.284 --> 20:00.068
you make the right decision
here.

20:00.111 --> 20:01.243
It's...

20:06.683 --> 20:07.945
-I'm spinning up.
-It's fine.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.512
We don't need to
talk about school.

20:09.556 --> 20:12.167
The mission and your men
come first.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.221
Look.

20:23.831 --> 20:27.574
You don't need to leave NYU
to be close to me.

20:27.617 --> 20:29.010
I'm fine.

20:29.053 --> 20:30.620
I'm not going backwards.

20:30.664 --> 20:32.579
Well, what are you doing?

20:32.622 --> 20:34.668
-I'm doing what I love.
-Mm.

20:34.711 --> 20:37.192
And what I love
is being with Bravo Team.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.412
It's where I'm meant to be.
Like you.

20:39.455 --> 20:42.197
NYU is where you're meant to be,
because...

20:42.241 --> 20:44.199
that's where you need
to be right now.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.809
And maybe I'm wrong,

20:45.853 --> 20:46.984
but I just don't want you
to give up your dream

20:47.028 --> 20:49.378
because of me.

20:49.422 --> 20:53.077
Did not expect to hear
the W-word from you.

20:53.121 --> 20:56.037
Really is more than a new coat
-of paint around here, huh?
-Hey, look,

20:56.080 --> 20:58.779
me and Cerby,
new tricks for old dogs, right?

20:58.822 --> 21:01.216
Maybe next semester,

21:01.260 --> 21:03.262
I rent
a Greenwich Village loft,

21:03.305 --> 21:04.959
and he can come live
with me.

21:05.002 --> 21:06.656
Whoa, he likes
that, huh?
Yeah?

21:08.179 --> 21:10.007
I'll give New York another shot.

21:10.051 --> 21:12.401
You're gonna find ways
to make this work.

21:12.445 --> 21:13.881
I know you.
I believe in you.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.709
-All right?
-Mm-hmm.

21:15.752 --> 21:17.232
And then, you know, maybe
you can give me some pointers,

21:17.276 --> 21:18.581
when you find it out.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.017
Okay.

21:20.061 --> 21:22.716
-Come home safe.
-I always do.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.422
Wow.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.903
Ain't this
a nice surprise.

21:35.946 --> 21:37.992
Driving a stolen car

21:38.035 --> 21:40.168
across, uh, Texas
state lines is a felony.

21:40.211 --> 21:43.127
Well, ignoring my phone calls
should be one, too.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.999
Yeah, uh...

21:45.042 --> 21:47.131
I apologize for
the radio silence.

21:48.132 --> 21:50.265
Do you have a second to talk?

21:50.309 --> 21:51.832
One exactly.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.921
Uh, we're getting
spun up.

21:53.964 --> 21:56.053
When will you be back?

21:57.054 --> 21:58.578
I don't know.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.623
Is everything okay?

22:04.061 --> 22:05.541
I'm pregnant.

22:10.677 --> 22:13.201
Okay, uh...

22:16.378 --> 22:19.033
Man, this would've been
a lot easier on the phone.

22:19.076 --> 22:21.514
Seeing your reaction...

22:21.557 --> 22:23.559
Um, uh...

22:25.561 --> 22:27.476
I, uh...

22:32.220 --> 22:34.396
Okay.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.398
Yeah, I'll-I'll call.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.487
Um, I'll call you.

22:41.098 --> 22:43.318
I'll-I'll call you
when I get back.

23:01.597 --> 23:03.207
Sonny.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.471
Hey.

23:06.733 --> 23:08.430
Huh?

23:08.474 --> 23:10.040
-Are you all right, man?
-Uh, yeah.

23:10.084 --> 23:11.433
Good to have the team back,
huh, reunited?

23:11.477 --> 23:13.435
-Yeah, it's good.
-Yeah. Yeah.

23:13.479 --> 23:14.741
You sure you're okay?

23:14.784 --> 23:16.177
You're usually foaming
at the mouth

23:16.220 --> 23:16.960
to get out of Vah Beach,
crush some skulls.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.875
Yeah, just, uh...

23:18.919 --> 23:21.748
something,
you know, something is...

23:21.791 --> 23:23.489
Something's brewing in Texas.

23:23.532 --> 23:25.055
Texas?

23:25.099 --> 23:26.709
Sandbox is in
the other direction, man.

23:26.753 --> 23:29.538
Yeah, just, um, this could,
this could be a big deal.

23:32.106 --> 23:33.847
Well, look, whatever's in Texas

23:33.890 --> 23:35.196
is gonna be there
when we come back.

23:35.239 --> 23:36.980
I need my, uh, reliable
knuckle-dragger

23:37.024 --> 23:38.504
ready to roll, huh?

23:38.547 --> 23:40.244
-So, let's focus up, okay?
-Roger that.

23:40.288 --> 23:41.855
Good? Yeah.
Yeah, yes, sir.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.204
Hey, let's get together, boys.

23:43.247 --> 23:44.466
Wake 'em up.

23:44.510 --> 23:45.902
-Your cover identification.
-Wake up.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.687
We are Army Corps
of Engineers,

23:47.730 --> 23:49.428
working in Jordan.

23:49.471 --> 23:50.603
We'll be staging
from there

23:50.646 --> 23:52.474
to recover Iranian drones

23:52.518 --> 23:54.563
Special Activities
has located across the border

23:54.607 --> 23:56.609
in Daraa, Syria.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.175
Be nice to be rolling with Ray.

23:58.219 --> 23:59.699
Have the whole team
back together.

23:59.742 --> 24:01.483
Eh, not just rolling with him.

24:01.527 --> 24:03.790
Since this operation is
primarily Special Activities,

24:03.833 --> 24:05.139
he'll be acting OIC.

24:05.182 --> 24:06.575
What? Does that mean

24:06.619 --> 24:08.011
that he outranks Jason?

24:08.055 --> 24:09.796
'Cause that
will be different.

24:09.839 --> 24:12.015
No, it doesn't.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.626
All it means is
the active OIC

24:13.669 --> 24:15.366
knows how Bravo operates.

24:15.410 --> 24:17.325
Ray will read us in
when we arrive.

24:17.368 --> 24:18.457
Good.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.981
Let's get ready
to roll, boys.

24:21.024 --> 24:22.678
Hey, we, uh...

24:22.722 --> 24:24.898
We sure Ray's
gonna be ready?

24:25.942 --> 24:27.683
First op back
after being sidelined.

24:27.727 --> 24:29.642
I know how tough
it was for me.

24:29.685 --> 24:31.948
Well, yeah, but the minute
those, uh, bullets

24:31.992 --> 24:33.472
started flying, you...

24:33.515 --> 24:35.474
you were ready to go,
like you never left, right?

24:35.517 --> 24:37.388
Yeah, but probably gonna be
a little harder for him,

24:37.432 --> 24:38.955
you know,
after what he survived.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.914
That's why we have our training.

24:40.957 --> 24:42.742
Right?

24:42.785 --> 24:44.874
He wouldn't have come back
if he wasn't right in the head.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.397
-He's good.
-Copy.

24:46.441 --> 24:48.922
It's just, uh...

24:48.965 --> 24:50.750
It's a lot for him to shoulder.

24:50.793 --> 24:52.360
You know, on top of the pressure
of being in charge of the op.

24:52.403 --> 24:54.057
There is no pressure.

24:54.101 --> 24:56.495
My team. My op.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.366
No one knows that better
than Ray, right?

25:04.590 --> 25:06.548
Hey.
Hey.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.419
What's going on?

25:08.463 --> 25:11.379
It looked like you
and Jason, something ..., y-yeah.

25:11.422 --> 25:13.512
He was just bending my ear
about Soto's changes.

25:15.339 --> 25:16.602
Yeah.
Yeah.

25:16.645 --> 25:18.778
That new dynamic
can't be easy for him.

25:19.909 --> 25:21.737
Yeah.
Hey, you were
right, by the way.

25:21.781 --> 25:24.653
About the guys and us.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.742
You know, I mean,
Clay knows the whole deal.

25:26.786 --> 25:28.614
He was great about it.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.312
That's good.

25:32.661 --> 25:34.707
I got to check on my gear.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.197
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:48.329 --> 25:50.200
Oh. Boys.

25:50.244 --> 25:51.767
All right.

25:51.811 --> 25:53.987
Your bunkroom's upstairs
on the left.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.815
It's a bit crowded,
but you guys will manage.

25:55.858 --> 25:58.078
You're not in
there with us?

25:58.121 --> 25:59.079
No, I got my own setup.

25:59.122 --> 26:00.820
Ooh, Mr. Warrant Officer.

26:00.863 --> 26:03.300
A little too fancy to stay
with the masses here, huh?

26:03.344 --> 26:05.694
No, I've just been putting in
real late hours running this op,

26:05.738 --> 26:07.348
so I figured I'd spare you all
the distraction.

26:07.391 --> 26:09.480
Go ahead, check it out.

26:12.353 --> 26:13.920
Hey, uh, I got this, uh...

26:13.963 --> 26:15.835
Should've given it
to you earlier, but...

26:15.878 --> 26:17.227
holding onto it.

26:17.271 --> 26:19.882
It's your watch
you lost in Tunisia.
Ah.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.623
I don't need it. I'm set.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.233
Thanks.

26:23.277 --> 26:24.757
Everything okay?

26:24.800 --> 26:26.497
Absolutely.

26:28.456 --> 26:30.676
I don't know, just...

26:30.719 --> 26:32.852
You being back here
in this environment

26:32.895 --> 26:34.505
and everything
you went through, man.

26:34.549 --> 26:36.725
I get it.
Like I said,
brother, just another op.

26:36.769 --> 26:38.858
Go ahead and get settled, man.

26:38.901 --> 26:40.424
Warno in five.

26:44.733 --> 26:46.387
Everyone,
meet our S.A. liaison,

26:46.430 --> 26:48.737
Chief Petty Officer
Mina Hassan.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.957
Thank you. Hadi Fadel,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.002
Syrian national,
has brokered

26:53.046 --> 26:55.614
a deal selling
five Iranian drones similar

26:55.657 --> 26:57.528
to those used in an attack
on the American base

26:57.572 --> 26:58.704
in Baghdad last month.

26:58.747 --> 27:00.531
-Who's the seller?
-Unknown.

27:00.575 --> 27:02.185
Buyer?
Also unknown.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.187
But Fadel is set to deliver
in the next 24 hours.

27:04.231 --> 27:07.800
Intel has the transfer
at this warehouse in Daraa.

27:07.843 --> 27:10.019
Now, our primary objective
is to destroy the drones,

27:10.063 --> 27:11.586
but we're cleared
to capture anyone--

27:11.630 --> 27:13.414
Fadel, buyer, seller-- on site.

27:13.457 --> 27:14.850
When do we roll out?

27:14.894 --> 27:16.635
Soon as we confirm
weapons are on target.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.375
Ah, it seems like a pretty
quick hit, right? Helo in...

27:18.419 --> 27:20.421
Negative. We're gonna run
a Trojan Horse.

27:20.464 --> 27:21.727
Cross the border in
the back of a truck

27:21.770 --> 27:23.250
driven by one
of my local assets.

27:23.293 --> 27:24.730
You're not considering
border guards.

27:24.773 --> 27:26.514
It's a lot easier to fly
over their heads, Ray.

27:26.557 --> 27:28.603
Well, there's no way we're
getting clearance on air assets.

27:31.301 --> 27:33.129
This is like
watching <i>Boogie Nights</i>

27:33.173 --> 27:34.609
with your parents
level of awkward.

27:35.958 --> 27:37.220
If you need help
filling out a request,

27:37.264 --> 27:38.700
Spenser here, he's, uh,

27:38.744 --> 27:40.354
good at filling out forms, now.

27:40.397 --> 27:42.704
Right?
Whatever you need.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.489
I'll execute
whatever plan you two pick.

27:45.533 --> 27:46.969
Air's a nonstarter.

27:47.013 --> 27:48.841
It's already been requested
and denied twice.

27:48.884 --> 27:50.843
-Push the issue.
-Jordan is not
supporting this operation

27:50.886 --> 27:52.671
-at any level.
Ray, push the issue.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.977
So, we do not fly helos
through their airspace, period.

27:55.021 --> 27:56.675
We infil via truck. Clay.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.677
-Prep the CTR cameras.
-Copy that.

27:58.720 --> 27:59.939
Sonny.

27:59.982 --> 28:01.331
Prep RFDs.

28:01.375 --> 28:02.376
Standard charges, too.

28:02.419 --> 28:04.595
Roger that.

28:06.510 --> 28:07.773
What the hell was that?

28:07.816 --> 28:09.818
Mission planning usually

28:09.862 --> 28:11.733
is a discussion
between the two of us.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.517
Not you openly challenging me.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.476
I reminded you of the facts

28:15.519 --> 28:17.086
that you may have overlooked.

28:17.130 --> 28:18.740
Like us needing to operate
under the radar out here.

28:18.784 --> 28:21.177
And I look at those facts,
and I make a decision.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.788
Except this is my op,

28:22.831 --> 28:24.311
and I know more
-about it than anyone.
-Oh, okay.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.269
So that's how
it's gonna be now?
Jace.

28:26.313 --> 28:28.054
I'm sorry you feel
like I stepped on your toes,

28:28.097 --> 28:29.708
but part of my new job is
being a leader.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.405
We can't let
how Bravo used to do things

28:31.448 --> 28:33.320
dictate how they're done now.

28:33.363 --> 28:34.930
Situation's changed.

28:49.292 --> 28:51.338
Hey. Where's Sonny?

28:51.381 --> 28:53.166
Thought I told him
to check the RFDs.

28:53.209 --> 28:54.645
Yeah, he's finished.

28:54.689 --> 28:55.951
That's good.

28:55.995 --> 28:57.823
At least someone
around here is, uh,

28:57.866 --> 29:00.826
doing what I ask them to do.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.305
If it wasn't for me

29:02.349 --> 29:03.393
talking to Lindell, you wouldn't
even be on this team.

29:03.437 --> 29:04.873
-Yeah, I know.
-Yeah.

29:04.917 --> 29:06.440
So a little loyalty
would be nice.

29:06.483 --> 29:08.529
You could've had my back
in there.

29:08.572 --> 29:11.793
Not openly agreeing with Ray
was me backing you up.

29:11.837 --> 29:14.056
So, you did agree with him?

29:14.100 --> 29:16.842
Or was it you just don't want
to mess with his confidence

29:16.885 --> 29:18.321
on his first op back?

29:18.365 --> 29:20.019
Look, man, it's...

29:20.062 --> 29:23.413
It's weird for all of us
that he outranks you on this op,

29:23.457 --> 29:24.850
probably you mostly.

29:24.893 --> 29:26.329
Listen.

29:26.373 --> 29:28.288
job stays the same

29:28.331 --> 29:29.942
no matter what changes
in the head shed.

29:38.037 --> 29:40.343
I'm glad Bravo was up next
in the rotation

29:40.387 --> 29:42.041
when we completed
the target package.

29:42.084 --> 29:44.347
W-W-Wait. What do you mean
next up in the rotation?

29:44.391 --> 29:46.001
Didn't...
Ray didn't request us?

29:46.045 --> 29:48.482
-Luck of the draw.
-Wait, wait, what...

29:49.657 --> 29:51.354
Luck of the draw?

29:52.573 --> 29:54.705
How's, uh...
I'm sorry, how is he...

29:54.749 --> 29:56.011
How's he doing out here?

29:56.055 --> 29:56.969
Well, I don't really
have anything

29:57.012 --> 29:58.231
to compare him to.

29:58.274 --> 29:59.798
Compared to other,
you know, operators

29:59.841 --> 30:01.103
that you've worked with.

30:01.147 --> 30:02.235
Or, you know,
any warrant officer,

30:02.278 --> 30:03.758
um, just in general.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.281
You're worried
he's suffering aftereffects

30:05.325 --> 30:06.761
from what he went through?

30:06.805 --> 30:08.241
Has he talked to you
about his captivity?

30:08.284 --> 30:09.546
No.

30:09.590 --> 30:12.114
But I haven't seen
any red flags.

30:12.158 --> 30:14.551
I mean, he's clearheaded.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.118
Making sound decisions.

30:16.162 --> 30:18.555
Forcing me
to up my game.
Yeah?

30:18.599 --> 30:19.948
Yeah. And the fact

30:19.992 --> 30:21.558
that he requested
to start his assignment

30:21.602 --> 30:23.647
two weeks early sets
a pretty high bar.

30:23.691 --> 30:24.866
He requested?

30:28.000 --> 30:30.480
He told me he was called
out here early.
No.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.395
It was Ray's choice.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.702
The officer he turned over with
didn't mind going home early.

30:50.196 --> 30:52.067
Coming up to
the border crossing.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.592
How long has the driver
been an asset, Ray?

30:55.636 --> 30:57.638
A few years. He's solid.

30:57.681 --> 30:59.901
Yeah. These guards get nosy,
we're done.

31:27.450 --> 31:30.540
Hold. Hold.

31:34.718 --> 31:36.416
Mm-mm.

32:06.272 --> 32:08.230
Havoc, this is 1.
I pass Ripley.

32:08.274 --> 32:10.754
I copy Ripley, Bravo 1.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.133
Two guards on either side

32:41.176 --> 32:42.830
of the front entrance.

32:42.873 --> 32:45.311
-Stand by to break out.
Praise the good Lord.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.617
Starting to feel like
a bunch of sardines in a can.

32:47.661 --> 32:49.445
Starting to smell like it, too.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.322
Let's bust them.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.433
Havoc, this is 1.
I pass Jackpot.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.871
Sonny, get out
-the standard charges.
-Roger that.

33:23.914 --> 33:26.656
Only three boxes.
Means we're missing two drones.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.049
Mission failure without 'em all.

33:28.093 --> 33:30.095
The truck took us too long
to get here.

33:30.138 --> 33:31.574
Should've came in by helo.

33:34.099 --> 33:36.405
There's got to be something
-here that left a trail.
Go SSE

33:36.449 --> 33:37.406
with Metal and Brock.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.582
Roger.

33:49.679 --> 33:51.290
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.074
Multiple vehicles approaching
your pos from the south.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.249
ETA four mikes.

33:54.293 --> 33:56.425
Good copy. All right, Sonny.

33:56.469 --> 33:58.079
Let's wind it up. Let's go.

34:09.264 --> 34:10.744
Sonny, blow it.

34:13.442 --> 34:15.096
What the hell, Sonny?

34:15.140 --> 34:17.055
I don't know what's wrong.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.752
Thought I told you
to check the RFDs.

34:18.795 --> 34:21.189
I did. RFD is fine.
Charge just didn't blow.

34:21.233 --> 34:22.538
Got to be kidding me.

34:22.582 --> 34:24.497
We got to go back
and figure this out.

34:24.540 --> 34:25.976
-What's the call?
-If it's a hang fire,

34:26.020 --> 34:27.456
it could blow
while we're inside.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.980
We got nothing else.
Sonny, Clay, back inside.

34:30.024 --> 34:31.243
Manually detonate.

34:31.286 --> 34:32.461
Move!

34:33.680 --> 34:34.768
Incoming.

34:52.394 --> 34:53.830
Brock, Metal, fall back!

34:56.703 --> 34:59.009
Jace, you're moving us
within the blast radius!

34:59.053 --> 35:00.620
Rather be in a gunfight?

35:07.105 --> 35:09.281
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Move it!

35:17.332 --> 35:19.378
Hurry up, Sonny.

35:20.901 --> 35:22.729
Havoc, this is 1.
I got troops in contact.

35:30.998 --> 35:32.391
You didn't label your fuses?

35:32.434 --> 35:34.610
-That's demo 101, Sonny.
-We're good.

35:34.654 --> 35:36.438
Okay? Just got to connect
the shorter one

35:36.482 --> 35:38.788
and initiate.

35:44.185 --> 35:45.926
Havoc, this is 1.

35:45.969 --> 35:48.058
Tango's kilo. All quiet. Over.

35:52.106 --> 35:53.455
I see smoke.

35:53.499 --> 35:55.240
Let's roll.

35:55.283 --> 35:57.372
Burning. Breaking out. How copy?

35:57.416 --> 35:58.504
That's a good copy, 3.

36:00.288 --> 36:01.594
We're moving! Moving! Moving!

36:01.637 --> 36:03.639
Moving! Moving!

36:12.996 --> 36:16.261
Havoc, this is 1.
I pass Connor. Requesting exfil.

36:17.349 --> 36:19.438
Copy, Bravo 1.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.006
Tell me what you got.

36:23.050 --> 36:26.009
NSA sent over thermal imagery

36:26.053 --> 36:27.881
of the target building.
Crates for two drones

36:27.924 --> 36:29.230
were moved out
through what appears to be

36:29.274 --> 36:30.884
an underground tunnel
last night.

36:30.927 --> 36:33.843
Well, I guess those helos
wouldn't have helped.

36:33.887 --> 36:35.715
So, we got two
drones in the wind

36:35.758 --> 36:37.586
and no clue if they're with
Fadel, the buyer or the seller.

36:37.630 --> 36:38.979
We better find those two drones,

36:39.022 --> 36:40.763
or they're gonna unleash
even more hell.

36:40.807 --> 36:42.765
We're not cleared for additional
operations, so Bravo's wheels up

36:42.809 --> 36:44.419
-tomorrow.
-I can help process the intel

36:44.463 --> 36:45.768
-until we leave.
Thanks, Davis.

36:45.812 --> 36:47.553
It's gonna be
a long night.

36:50.164 --> 36:51.774
-Hey.
Hey.

36:51.818 --> 36:53.776
Got a little dicey
out there, huh?

36:53.820 --> 36:55.474
Yeah. The RFD didn't fire.

36:55.517 --> 36:58.259
-Wasn't my fault.
-I'm not saying it was.

36:58.303 --> 37:01.349
I'm just glad everybody
-made it back okay.
-Yeah.

37:04.309 --> 37:07.486
Hey, is everything
okay with Sonny?

37:07.529 --> 37:09.662
Might be a little
off his game. Why?

37:09.705 --> 37:11.359
I-I mean, he's been weird

37:11.403 --> 37:13.143
ever since I told him
that you know about us.

37:13.187 --> 37:15.233
Think it could be cold feet?

37:15.276 --> 37:16.582
About you?

37:16.625 --> 37:19.454
You said it yourself.
Commitment's

37:19.498 --> 37:20.977
not really his thing.

37:21.021 --> 37:22.631
Look, I'll-I'll see where
his head's at, okay?

37:22.675 --> 37:25.373
No, it's my drama.
It's not yours, so...

37:25.417 --> 37:28.158
Look, maybe it is, maybe
it isn't. Who knows?

37:28.202 --> 37:30.117
But the thing is, it affects all
of Bravo if he's losing focus.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.162
Yeah, but I don't
want you ...ok,

37:32.206 --> 37:33.816
if-if you're gonna
give up Bravo,

37:33.860 --> 37:35.949
then you at least deserve
to know where his head's at.

37:35.992 --> 37:38.038
I'll talk to him.
All right?

37:40.736 --> 37:42.782
Blowing those charges
with time fuze?

37:42.825 --> 37:46.394
That is some old-school
Vietnam techniques right there.

37:46.438 --> 37:49.354
-Makes Sonny mission MVP.
-No, no, no.

37:49.397 --> 37:50.790
That makes me
Chuck Norris with muscles

37:50.833 --> 37:52.095
is what it makes me.

37:52.139 --> 37:53.793
Problem is Chuck Norris

37:53.836 --> 37:55.447
wouldn't have made that
rookie mistake with those fuses.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.318
What?

37:57.362 --> 37:59.494
Rookie? What are you
talking about? I can I.D.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.670
the length of a fuse
with my eyes closed

38:01.714 --> 38:03.498
quicker than you could I.D.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.892
a Taylor Swift song
with your ears plugged.

38:05.935 --> 38:08.590
That-that doesn't
-make any sense.
Yes, it does.

38:08.634 --> 38:10.984
Uh, no.
But it does make you wonder

38:11.027 --> 38:14.117
what else can Sonny I.D.
just by feel?

38:14.161 --> 38:16.859
Tell you what, why don't we
blindfold him and find out.

38:18.513 --> 38:21.299
All right. Better yet, okay,

38:21.342 --> 38:24.824
why don't we, uh,
raise your glasses here

38:24.867 --> 38:27.348
to Chief Warrant Officer
Raymond Perry.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.742
The best OIC
that Bravo ever had!

38:31.396 --> 38:33.354
Thanks, brother.

38:33.398 --> 38:35.704
Uh, you know what? Hey,

38:35.748 --> 38:39.055
thanks to all of y'all for, uh,
trusting me out there today.

38:39.099 --> 38:40.535
How'd it feel
being back in the fire?

38:40.579 --> 38:42.450
Like I never left.

38:42.494 --> 38:44.017
All right. You know what?

38:44.060 --> 38:46.846
I am still on the clock, so...

38:46.889 --> 38:48.238
Hey.

38:48.282 --> 38:49.631
Hey, Ray.

38:49.675 --> 38:51.720
Whoa, Ray. Look, man,

38:51.764 --> 38:53.722
I know it's been a bumpy reentry
back for the team,

38:53.766 --> 38:57.465
but what do you say we kick back
and have a beer like old times?

38:57.509 --> 38:59.859
Show everyone that, uh,
things aren't so different.

38:59.902 --> 39:01.382
You of all people
are giving me a hard time

39:01.426 --> 39:03.079
because I'm determined
to finish this up?

39:03.123 --> 39:05.430
Right, as determined
as you were to start it.

39:05.473 --> 39:08.171
-What's that mean?
-It means that the Navy

39:08.215 --> 39:10.870
didn't make you come out here
early. That was on you.

39:10.913 --> 39:12.872
You lied to me.

39:12.915 --> 39:14.874
They gave me an opportunity,
-and I took it.
-Hmm.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.571
If I didn't explain that
to you adequately,

39:16.615 --> 39:18.356
I am sorry
for the miscommunication.

39:18.399 --> 39:19.487
-"Miscommunication"?
-Jason,

39:19.531 --> 39:21.010
someone's running around
out there

39:21.054 --> 39:22.403
with two military drones
and possible ordnance.

39:22.447 --> 39:23.926
You gonna let me find them
or not?

39:23.970 --> 39:25.711
Mm-hmm.

39:30.672 --> 39:33.675
Hey. Uh, I found something.

39:33.719 --> 39:37.200
A cell phone collected on
target communicated with Fadel

39:37.244 --> 39:38.811
through self-destructing messaging apps.

39:38.854 --> 39:40.421
Points to our seller

39:40.465 --> 39:42.815
as Yassine Kassen,

39:42.858 --> 39:44.512
aka Raqqa Jacques.

39:44.556 --> 39:46.906
The French Algerian leader

39:46.949 --> 39:49.865
of a paramilitary splinter unit
of AKM.

39:52.607 --> 39:54.479
You okay?

39:54.522 --> 39:55.784
Look, I'm sorry. I-I...

39:55.828 --> 39:57.220
should've warned you that AKM

39:57.264 --> 39:58.787
<i>was involved.</i>

40:00.006 --> 40:02.095
You need a minute?

40:11.278 --> 40:13.323
It's just, uh...

40:15.282 --> 40:17.589
Nice to put a name to the face.

40:17.632 --> 40:20.418
Oh, you've seen this guy before?

40:21.462 --> 40:23.595
When he tortured me in Syria.

40:25.031 --> 40:28.513
Hey. You cannot tell the guys.

40:28.556 --> 40:31.124
-What? Why not?
-Davis.

40:32.125 --> 40:34.040
What do you think
it's gonna do to them

40:34.083 --> 40:35.781
when they find out
that they're this close

40:35.824 --> 40:37.173
and they can't do anything now?

40:37.217 --> 40:39.654
Jason should know.

40:39.698 --> 40:41.874
Ray ...have to handle this
my own way.

40:41.917 --> 40:43.397
What way is that? This guy

40:43.441 --> 40:44.616
tortured you.

40:44.659 --> 40:46.922
I'll do
what I was trained to do.

40:46.966 --> 40:49.011
But you?

40:50.535 --> 40:51.971
You don't say a word.

40:53.799 --> 40:55.583
To anyone.

41:07.334 --> 41:09.379
Hey, brother.

41:10.990 --> 41:12.600
How's it going in there?

41:12.644 --> 41:15.168
Uh, intel
hasn't yielded anything yet.

41:15.211 --> 41:18.171
Nothing or nothing
actionable?

41:18.214 --> 41:20.173
Nothing.

41:20.216 --> 41:22.088
Wow. That's too bad

41:22.131 --> 41:23.698
you can't keep
an assault team on hold.

41:23.742 --> 41:25.526
How long before

41:25.570 --> 41:26.962
you, uh, have a target?

41:27.006 --> 41:28.486
As long as it takes.
And s-stop fishing

41:28.529 --> 41:30.096
for a reason to stay
and let me do my job.

41:30.139 --> 41:31.750
It's part of your job.
You're still on Bravo.

41:31.793 --> 41:34.666
And part of my job
is keeping an eye on my team.

41:34.709 --> 41:36.319
-On me?
-Yeah, on you.

41:36.363 --> 41:39.932
Bravo 2 and I,
we don't miscommunicate.

41:39.975 --> 41:41.803
What the hell's
-going on with you?
What's going on is my role

41:41.847 --> 41:43.065
has changed,
and you can't handle it.

41:43.109 --> 41:44.197
Your role has changed

41:44.240 --> 41:45.546
-or you've changed?
-I'm fine.

41:45.590 --> 41:46.808
I'm just sorry you're not.

41:46.852 --> 41:48.244
So, now it's
my problem?
Yes.

41:48.288 --> 41:49.942
Jason,

41:49.985 --> 41:51.160
you are distracting me
from my work.

41:51.204 --> 41:52.684
-Distracting you?
-Yes, you are.

41:52.727 --> 41:54.555
-How?
-So, would you
please get some sleep
