WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:07.875
Operation Icebreaker.

00:10.461 --> 00:13.088
- How we liking that?
- We never used that before, did we?

00:13.297 --> 00:15.424
- Isn't that the name of a breath mint?
- What?

00:15.632 --> 00:18.719
- Ice Breakers, right? Breath mint?
- Nobody's gonna think that.

00:18.927 --> 00:21.805
Gonna be thinking about some ship
in the North Pole breaking ice.

00:22.014 --> 00:24.892
Says you. I'm gonna be thinking
Operation Breath Mint.

00:25.100 --> 00:28.896
I'm thinking Operation Breath Mint every
time you and me are on a stakeout.

00:29.104 --> 00:31.690
Your breath can knock a buzzard
off a shit waggon.

00:31.899 --> 00:36.278
All right, Operation TBD.

00:36.487 --> 00:37.613
Thanks for nothing, Gom.

00:38.197 --> 00:42.159
Anyway, say hello to
Domingo Gallardo Molina.

00:42.367 --> 00:46.121
A.k. a. Krazy-8. Way smarter
than your average cheese eater.

00:46.330 --> 00:49.917
I turned him out when he was street,
but this dude's like <i>The Jeffersons... </i>

00:50.125 --> 00:52.544
...moving on up.
- Every dealer he'd throw at us...

00:52.753 --> 00:56.715
...he'd end up snaking their customers.
- Turns out he's missing, presumed dead.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.134
Found his car out in the boonies.

00:59.343 --> 01:03.430
Last guy he ratted out
was none other than his cousin...

01:03.639 --> 01:05.349
...Emilio Koyama.

01:05.557 --> 01:07.976
You thinking the cousin found out
and took revenge?

01:08.185 --> 01:10.813
Could be, turns out he's missing too.

01:11.021 --> 01:14.358
And normally I'd say
someone did the world a favour.

01:14.566 --> 01:18.445
But our snitch's car, turns out
we find two grams of meth in it...

01:18.654 --> 01:20.656
...we take it to the lab,
they come back...

01:20.864 --> 01:23.617
...they tell us it the purest
they've ever seen.

01:23.826 --> 01:25.452
Ninety-nine-point-one percent.

01:25.661 --> 01:28.205
Our chemist is blown away.
Said he couldn't do better.

01:28.413 --> 01:31.416
Worse yet, it didn't come out
of some super lab in Mexico...

01:31.625 --> 01:34.753
...we're thinking this was cooked
here in the Land of Enchantment.

01:34.962 --> 01:38.423
Car was abandoned
at what appears to be a cook site.

01:38.632 --> 01:41.093
This is the only other thing
left behind.

01:41.301 --> 01:44.763
We're sending it off to Quantico,
see if they can pull something off it.

01:44.972 --> 01:49.977
Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter
element and found the same 99.1 meth.

01:51.436 --> 01:52.604
So be on notice.

01:53.730 --> 01:56.108
We got new players in town.

01:56.942 --> 02:00.445
Now, we don't know who they are,
or where they come from...

02:00.654 --> 02:03.073
...but they possess
an extremely high skill set.

02:03.615 --> 02:05.451
<i>Me, personally... </i>

02:06.201 --> 02:09.872
<i>...I'm thinking Albuquerque</i>
<i>just might have a new kingpin. </i>

02:44.608 --> 02:47.152
Jesus, Walt,
you're burning the shit out of them.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.237
Damn it.

02:49.446 --> 02:51.865
Hey, Sky, you got any more chicken?

02:52.073 --> 02:54.034
Emeril, here,
is gonna need a fresh pack.

02:56.203 --> 02:57.454
All right, looking good.

02:57.662 --> 03:00.373
Is this low-fat mayonnaise
in the coleslaw?

03:00.999 --> 03:03.627
I don't know, it's store-bought.

03:03.919 --> 03:06.630
Okay, Hank, you need another beer?

03:06.838 --> 03:08.423
Does the pope shit in his hat?

03:08.632 --> 03:12.344
Yeah, I don't think that he does, Hank,
and I think everybody would like it...

03:12.552 --> 03:13.929
...if you'd stop saying that.

03:14.137 --> 03:16.348
- Marie, some more wine?
- I'm all right, thanks.

03:16.556 --> 03:18.308
- All right.
- Hey, I want a beer.

03:18.517 --> 03:21.603
Yeah, I want Shania Twain
to give me a tuggy.

03:21.811 --> 03:23.688
Guess what. It ain't happening either.

03:23.897 --> 03:25.982
- How about some more soda?
- Yeah, sure.

03:26.191 --> 03:28.151
Honey, do you need anything?

03:28.360 --> 03:31.988
- No, Walt, thank you.
- Okay. Be right back.

03:51.591 --> 03:54.344
- No.
- What, are you kidding me?

03:54.553 --> 03:56.805
You look like
a damn movie star, man.

03:57.013 --> 03:59.516
Girls gotta be lining up left and right.

04:00.100 --> 04:02.561
- Tell him how good-looking he is.
- He's adorable.

04:02.769 --> 04:05.522
He doesn't wanna be fricking adorable,
he wants to be hot.

04:05.730 --> 04:08.275
See what I'm talking about?
That's female perspective.

04:08.483 --> 04:12.445
- She's supposed to say that.
- Look, a guy doesn't gotta look like...

04:12.654 --> 04:15.824
...you know, Charlton Heston...
I'm talking Moses days.

04:16.031 --> 04:19.619
- To get a girl, all right?
You just gotta have...

04:20.327 --> 04:22.038
...confidence.

04:22.247 --> 04:24.875
Confidence and persistence.

04:25.083 --> 04:27.335
Okay? That's what I'm talking about.

04:27.544 --> 04:30.046
I chased your aunt Marie, here,
all over creation.

04:30.255 --> 04:32.966
I kept bugging her for a date,
she kept saying no.

04:33.175 --> 04:34.801
What, I asked you, like, 50 times?

04:35.010 --> 04:38.847
Yeah, it was before they tightened
the stalking laws.

04:39.598 --> 04:43.852
Anyway, how about your dad here?
That there's a good story, Walt.

04:44.060 --> 04:48.773
- Tell him how you met Skylar.
- Mom was a waitress in Los Alamos...

04:48.982 --> 04:52.652
...and Dad said that thing to you.

04:52.861 --> 04:55.989
Well, actually, your mother
wasn't a waitress...

04:56.198 --> 05:00.368
...it was a summer job,
and she was the hostess...

05:00.577 --> 05:03.163
...and she also worked
the cash register.

05:03.371 --> 05:07.042
And I used to go in there a lot because
it was close enough to the lab...

05:07.250 --> 05:10.045
...where I could ride my bicycle.

05:11.087 --> 05:12.756
And once I noticed her...

05:13.298 --> 05:18.345
...it got to be so that I would only go in
when I knew she was working.

05:18.553 --> 05:21.640
When it was slow,
she would lean against the counter...

05:22.182 --> 05:26.269
...doing her crossword puzzles,
but kind of hiding it...

05:26.478 --> 05:28.647
...pretending that
she was still working...

05:28.855 --> 05:30.982
...and once I caught on to that...

05:31.191 --> 05:35.070
...I would do crossword puzzles while
I ate my grilled-cheese sandwich.

05:35.278 --> 05:37.948
It got so that every day at lunch...

05:38.156 --> 05:41.409
...we would both be doing
<i>The New York Times</i> crossword puzzle...

05:41.618 --> 05:44.204
...10 feet from each other.

05:45.330 --> 05:48.625
And eventually...

05:49.209 --> 05:52.003
...I caught her looking over at me...

05:53.171 --> 05:55.090
...so I began saying:

05:55.298 --> 06:01.137
"Excuse me, 14 across,
seven-letter word for whatchamacallit...

06:01.346 --> 06:04.808
...may I ask what you wrote down?"

06:05.016 --> 06:09.187
And, well, that got us talking...

06:09.396 --> 06:13.733
...and, boy, I tell you,
I was terrible at those puzzles.

06:14.151 --> 06:17.654
I don't think that I finished
even one of them.

06:17.863 --> 06:21.032
But your mother
would do them in ink.

06:21.241 --> 06:22.367
Very smooth.

06:23.702 --> 06:26.288
I bet you didn't think
your old man had it in him, huh?

06:26.496 --> 06:29.624
But that's what I'm talking about,
that's persistence, you see?

06:29.833 --> 06:31.877
Once you set your cap
for something...

06:32.085 --> 06:35.589
...or somebody,
you gotta just, you know...

06:37.883 --> 06:41.720
- Skylar.
- Mom, are you all right?

06:41.928 --> 06:44.055
Hey, hey.

06:44.264 --> 06:46.057
Honey, it's okay.

06:46.266 --> 06:48.268
What's the matter?

06:51.354 --> 06:53.190
What is it?

06:54.191 --> 06:56.318
Ask him.

07:05.911 --> 07:07.829
What's she talking about?

07:12.792 --> 07:13.960
Walt?

07:21.468 --> 07:23.720
I have cancer.

07:28.099 --> 07:29.601
Lung cancer.

07:39.611 --> 07:41.279
It's bad.

08:02.801 --> 08:04.594
<i>Ask him how long he's known. </i>

08:06.471 --> 08:10.016
- I guess a month, maybe.
- Oh, for God sakes, Walt.

08:10.225 --> 08:13.520
We're just sitting out there having
a cookout like nothing's going on.

08:13.728 --> 08:16.273
He made me promise
not to tell anybody.

08:16.648 --> 08:20.110
Christ, these last 48 hours.

08:20.360 --> 08:24.781
And it's the weekend, so I couldn't
even get his doctor on the phone.

08:24.990 --> 08:27.993
Buddy, why...? I mean, why wouldn't
you wanna tell anybody?

08:28.201 --> 08:33.999
Walt, don't you see
everybody just wants to help you.

08:34.207 --> 08:38.253
We're family.
We get through these things together.

08:38.461 --> 08:43.008
And I don't get, you know, lung cancer?
How can that happen?

08:43.216 --> 08:45.760
- You don't even smoke.
- You know, I'm thinking...

08:45.969 --> 08:47.888
...that this goes back 20 years,
maybe...

08:48.096 --> 08:51.725
...to the applications lab, all those
chemicals they had you working around.

08:51.933 --> 08:54.186
We always took
the proper precautions.

08:54.394 --> 08:57.689
One time you complained that
they didn't give you the right kind of...

08:57.898 --> 09:01.151
...I don't know, some kind of
ventilation hood or something...

09:01.359 --> 09:04.196
...and then the headaches.
- Honey, it wasn't that.

09:04.404 --> 09:06.740
How do they think
they can get away with this?

09:06.948 --> 09:12.871
- We should hire a lawyer.
- Okay, so first let's deal with this.

09:13.079 --> 09:16.958
Okay, so,
what's the next step for Walt?

09:17.167 --> 09:20.212
Certainly a second opinion, right?

09:20.420 --> 09:22.964
Right. Right, absolutely.

09:23.173 --> 09:27.511
Okay, so first thing tomorrow,
I talk to my radiologists...

09:28.094 --> 09:33.892
...we find you the best,
the oncology dream team.

09:34.100 --> 09:37.020
That's good. That's good.

09:37.229 --> 09:38.814
Yeah.

09:40.524 --> 09:42.067
Yeah?

09:43.068 --> 09:44.194
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

09:44.402 --> 09:45.779
Yeah.

09:51.409 --> 09:53.829
I'm gonna go check on Walt Jr.

09:54.746 --> 09:56.665
I'm gonna see...

09:56.873 --> 10:00.418
...if I can talk him into,
I don't know, joining us.

10:00.710 --> 10:04.881
I really didn't mean for him
to find out that way.

10:11.263 --> 10:12.806
Walt...

10:14.182 --> 10:16.101
...whatever happens...

10:17.602 --> 10:19.980
...I hope this goes without saying...

10:20.188 --> 10:22.274
...but whatever happens...

10:23.108 --> 10:25.110
...I want you to know that...

10:26.653 --> 10:29.489
...I'll always take care of your family.

10:57.142 --> 10:59.895
Yo, check out these fake Pop-Tarts.

11:00.103 --> 11:02.731
- These are mad tight, yo.
- No, thanks, man, pass.

11:02.939 --> 11:06.735
Your loss. These are from, like,
Canada, or something. Imported.

11:06.943 --> 11:08.987
Hey, yo, what happened
to your hallway, man?

11:09.196 --> 11:12.866
- Did, like, the ceiling fall down, or?
- Oh, yeah...

11:13.074 --> 11:16.369
...no, man,
I think the house is just settling.

11:16.578 --> 11:18.747
You know,
it's been caving in left and right.

11:18.955 --> 11:20.707
Hit me in the eye.

11:21.208 --> 11:23.627
- It's bananas.
- Yo, my pops could fix you up...

11:23.835 --> 11:26.171
...he's, like,
a contractor or something.

11:26.379 --> 11:28.715
Yeah? Yeah, right on,
I should grab that number.

11:28.924 --> 11:31.551
Say, Jesse,
you still cook a little crystal?

11:35.889 --> 11:39.476
Could be, yeah.
You know, from time to time.

11:39.684 --> 11:42.479
I heard you lost your partner.

11:42.687 --> 11:43.939
Emilio.

11:45.524 --> 11:46.775
Didn't he get locked up?

11:46.983 --> 11:49.569
No, man, he's out.
His cousin bailed him out.

11:49.778 --> 11:51.696
I think he skipped town
or something.

11:51.905 --> 11:54.199
I don't know about any of that,
I've just been...

11:54.407 --> 11:56.660
...kind of doing my own thing
these days, so...

11:56.868 --> 11:59.412
But you maybe
got some crystal, man?

11:59.621 --> 12:03.416
Because I could seriously go for a bowl
right now, you know, take the edge off.

12:03.625 --> 12:07.796
- Hell, yeah, Sunday night bowl, yo.
- All right.

12:10.465 --> 12:14.386
Well, maybe it just so happens...

12:14.594 --> 12:18.139
...that I just recently cooked
the best batch ever.

12:19.683 --> 12:20.725
Yeah?

12:21.268 --> 12:23.478
Oh, yeah. Came up
with this whole new recipe.

12:23.687 --> 12:25.730
It's more like a formula.

12:25.939 --> 12:30.277
It's, like,
way, way more chemically...

12:30.485 --> 12:33.321
Shit, you know,
it's just the bomb, so...

12:34.489 --> 12:37.617
But, you know, I don't know,
I've been thinking lately...

12:37.826 --> 12:39.786
...I'll just lay off of it for a while...

12:39.995 --> 12:42.956
...because lately it's been
kind of making me paranoid, so...

12:47.961 --> 12:51.047
You know, for, like,
health-wise, just lay off.

12:51.256 --> 12:55.677
Yo, if you're not into sharing, man,
just tell us to piss off, it's cool.

12:55.886 --> 12:58.305
- We don't need no soap opera.
- Yeah, man, whatever.

12:58.513 --> 13:00.348
No, no, it's all good, you know.

13:00.557 --> 13:04.728
I'm just saying,
hey, I got plenty of pot.

13:04.936 --> 13:07.189
Yeah, I think I'll bounce, man.

13:07.397 --> 13:09.566
Yeah, sounds about right.

13:09.774 --> 13:14.070
Hey, yo, yo. Hey, homes, I'm joking.

13:14.279 --> 13:17.240
Okay, I'm totally joking with you.

13:17.449 --> 13:20.035
You kidding? Sit down.

13:26.708 --> 13:29.336
Best scante ever.

13:29.544 --> 13:30.587
Grab that pipe.

16:24.761 --> 16:25.762
Okay, there.

16:33.311 --> 16:35.105
Shit.

16:45.574 --> 16:49.035
Walt, do you need some help?

16:51.121 --> 16:56.668
Oh, no, I'm fine, honey. I'm fine.
Just privacy.

16:56.877 --> 16:58.587
Thanks.

17:00.672 --> 17:03.383
I'm right outside if you need me.

17:03.758 --> 17:05.301
Okay.

17:12.267 --> 17:14.310
Yeah, any time on Friday
is absolutely fine.

17:14.519 --> 17:17.314
Thank you so much
for working us in.

17:19.648 --> 17:22.402
Can I just put that on a credit card?

17:22.611 --> 17:24.654
Great. Perfect.

17:24.863 --> 17:29.951
Okay, so we will see you at 10:45
on Friday morning.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.704
Thank you so much.

17:32.913 --> 17:34.498
Okay.

17:35.540 --> 17:38.460
Oh, yes.

17:38.668 --> 17:39.753
Honey...

17:39.961 --> 17:43.673
...the best oncologist, I mean,
not even just in New Mexico...

17:43.882 --> 17:46.968
...but one of the top 10
in the entire nation...

17:47.177 --> 17:50.388
...his name is Dr. Delcavoli...

17:50.597 --> 17:52.724
...and we see him on Friday.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.813
I mean,
Marie really came through for us.

17:58.021 --> 18:00.023
She had her boss call, and...

18:02.734 --> 18:06.780
Okay, this is good.

18:07.531 --> 18:09.241
From here on out, things are gonna...

18:09.449 --> 18:11.827
What's that we're putting on
a credit card?

18:12.035 --> 18:15.163
It's just a deposit kind of thing.

18:15.622 --> 18:19.543
- How much of a deposit?
- It's $5000.

18:19.918 --> 18:21.461
Five thousand?

18:24.381 --> 18:25.882
Jesus.

18:28.552 --> 18:30.720
What's that, just to start? I mean...

18:30.929 --> 18:33.098
...just to tell me
what I already know?

18:33.306 --> 18:35.809
Walt, he's not in our HMO, okay?

18:36.017 --> 18:38.854
So be it, we'll figure it out.

18:40.188 --> 18:43.692
Come on,
don't get hung up on money here.

18:43.900 --> 18:47.404
- We can always borrow from Hank.
- Absolutely not.

18:50.240 --> 18:51.616
No, I just...

18:51.825 --> 18:53.702
We're not gonna do that.

18:54.411 --> 18:56.079
Well, maybe we can ask your mom.

18:58.665 --> 19:00.542
Have you even called her yet?

19:03.628 --> 19:06.506
Walt, regardless, you're gonna have to
tell her about this...

19:06.715 --> 19:09.759
...I mean, I'm willing to do it, but I...
- I'll call. I'll call.

19:10.177 --> 19:12.137
Okay, look...

19:13.013 --> 19:16.766
...I don't even want us
thinking about money.

19:16.975 --> 19:18.977
Money is not the issue here.

19:19.186 --> 19:21.813
- It's not.
- I know. I know.

19:24.399 --> 19:25.400
It's not.

19:25.609 --> 19:27.027
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:27.235 --> 19:28.862
Okay.

19:29.613 --> 19:32.032
I'll take care of the deposit.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.825
Yeah?

19:34.409 --> 19:35.911
Yeah.

19:37.913 --> 19:40.624
I'll borrow it from my pension.

20:11.363 --> 20:12.405
Damn it!

20:15.242 --> 20:18.703
Hey. Hey, pal, what's up?

20:21.331 --> 20:24.292
Oh, yeah, no, I thought I heard mice.

20:25.085 --> 20:27.629
Boy, that's all we need, huh?

20:29.464 --> 20:31.341
So, what's up, pal?

20:31.550 --> 20:34.135
What the hell's wrong with you?

20:36.930 --> 20:41.226
- What?
- You're acting all...

20:41.434 --> 20:43.270
You're...

20:43.812 --> 20:49.192
You're all...
Why are you acting so weird?

20:49.401 --> 20:53.071
- Son.
- You're acting like nothing is going on.

21:46.333 --> 21:48.960
Oh, no, please. Please, please, no.

22:40.679 --> 22:42.305
Hey, no, hey!

22:43.390 --> 22:45.142
- Hey!
- Put that douche bag on the phone.

22:45.350 --> 22:46.393
Oh, come on.

22:46.601 --> 22:50.605
Hey, am I gonna have to
come down there and whup your ass?

23:03.910 --> 23:07.455
And let me tell you something else,
I'm not doing this for charity, right?

23:07.664 --> 23:10.000
I'm the best he's got.
He knows it, I know it...

23:10.208 --> 23:13.587
...I expect to be paid to a level
commensurate with...

23:13.795 --> 23:16.715
I said, " Dave, do you think 40 grand
is a proper bonus?"

23:17.257 --> 23:20.010
That's less than 10 percent
of what I booked this quarter.

23:20.218 --> 23:22.345
I'm not gonna sit here
and be disrespect...

23:22.554 --> 23:24.681
Oh, he's shitting bricks.

23:24.890 --> 23:26.266
Oh, you know he is.

23:26.475 --> 23:28.894
Yeah, that man lives in fear.
I'll go across town...

23:29.102 --> 23:30.437
Hell, I could go anywhere.

23:30.645 --> 23:32.647
Hoffman, Gordon Bradley, or Sorcher.

23:32.856 --> 23:36.693
Even Goldberg-Wayne. They'd make me
a partner for walking in the damn door...

23:36.902 --> 23:39.237
...that's how ecstatic they'd be.
- Next customer.

23:39.446 --> 23:41.615
Hells, yes, brother man.

23:42.824 --> 23:44.951
Dude, you should check this chick out.

23:45.994 --> 23:47.829
Who? No.

23:48.038 --> 23:49.956
Buddy, she's a cow.

23:50.540 --> 23:51.958
Stacey's a cow.

23:52.542 --> 23:55.170
We're talking major
barnyard boo-hog.

23:55.378 --> 23:59.508
Roll her in flour and look for
the wet spot before you hit that, man.

23:59.716 --> 24:02.427
That kind of stink does not wash off.

24:02.636 --> 24:05.013
- Sir?
- Right.

24:05.222 --> 24:06.890
Sir.

24:07.808 --> 24:08.892
Oh, yeah?

24:09.100 --> 24:11.186
- Sorry. Hi.
- Oh, totally.

24:11.394 --> 24:13.522
- Hi. What can I do for you today?
- Which dude?

24:13.730 --> 24:16.149
- That dude that looks like a lizard?
- Next in line.

24:16.358 --> 24:19.903
- And he limps like some leper.
- I'm sorry, I would like...

24:20.111 --> 24:22.072
...a cashier's cheque...
- Grosses me out.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.490
...in the full amount...

24:23.698 --> 24:28.495
...made out to Oncology Partners
of New Mexico, please.

24:28.829 --> 24:33.583
Oh, that's O-N-C-O-L-O-G-Y.

24:33.792 --> 24:35.669
Yeah, you got it.

24:37.712 --> 24:39.840
I don't understand
why they're forcing you...

24:40.048 --> 24:41.800
...to choose between
piccolo and oboe.

24:42.008 --> 24:43.802
You show so much promise
with both.

24:44.010 --> 24:46.346
They can't have any
switching between woodwinds.

24:46.555 --> 24:49.391
No matter how they divide it up,
someone would be left out.

24:49.599 --> 24:52.769
- Rules are rules, I guess.
- Sure, rules are rules. I'm all for that.

24:52.978 --> 24:56.148
But I'm telling you,
you really shine on that oboe.

24:56.356 --> 24:58.775
You have real talent,
and I'm not just saying that.

24:58.984 --> 25:00.652
Thanks.

25:01.111 --> 25:02.404
What about Mr. Pemberton?

25:02.612 --> 25:04.823
Is he giving you enough
individual attention?

25:05.031 --> 25:07.325
I'd say so.
He tries to talk to each one of us...

25:07.534 --> 25:09.619
...at least once during every practise.

25:09.828 --> 25:13.665
- That's good. Feedback's important.
- It's key, I think.

25:14.249 --> 25:17.169
Hey, so how was soccer practise?

25:20.755 --> 25:22.424
I think that was in our backyard.

25:31.349 --> 25:32.642
Who's there?

25:39.357 --> 25:41.735
What the hell are you doing out here?

25:44.905 --> 25:46.072
Hey, Dad.

25:47.657 --> 25:48.992
Hey, Mom.

25:49.534 --> 25:51.036
Jake.

25:51.244 --> 25:53.955
Got new patio furniture.

25:54.873 --> 25:56.708
Right on.

25:59.794 --> 26:01.463
My leg.

27:05.777 --> 27:07.863
What do you think it could be?

27:09.406 --> 27:11.616
God knows I'm no expert.

27:11.825 --> 27:15.453
I don't know. Uppers, downers?
Your guess is as good as mine.

27:15.662 --> 27:19.249
I think we should check his arms
for needle marks.

27:22.752 --> 27:23.837
Do we let him stay?

27:25.130 --> 27:28.133
The Presbyterian Church
has those meetings.

27:28.341 --> 27:32.012
So maybe on condition, you know?
If he agrees to attend.

27:33.221 --> 27:35.932
I just don't know what to tell Jake.

27:43.732 --> 27:46.985
- Hey.
- Hey. Good evening.

27:47.652 --> 27:49.905
Well? Sleep well?

27:50.489 --> 27:53.533
What time's...? What time is dinner?

27:54.784 --> 27:57.120
In about an hour.

28:00.123 --> 28:03.084
You know,
I could wash those clothes if you like.

28:03.293 --> 28:05.253
They look a little lived in.

28:06.505 --> 28:09.966
No, that's cool. Maybe later.

28:14.638 --> 28:16.181
We are not doing this again.

28:16.681 --> 28:18.183
No.

28:18.391 --> 28:21.520
We said we'd lay down the law,
we lay down the law.

28:21.728 --> 28:24.648
We just have to be
consistent about it.

29:10.485 --> 29:12.028
Hey.

29:13.029 --> 29:16.825
You're not taking the bus?

29:20.370 --> 29:22.414
All right. Well, listen.

29:22.998 --> 29:26.126
Give me maybe another 20 minutes,
and we'll get out of here.

29:26.334 --> 29:29.671
- All right.
- All right.

29:30.422 --> 29:32.174
Yeah, good.

30:02.913 --> 30:06.458
You know, I just think that...

30:09.711 --> 30:13.089
...things have a way
of working themselves out.

30:37.864 --> 30:39.950
When did you get this?

30:40.158 --> 30:42.369
Last May at the year-end assembly.

30:42.577 --> 30:45.497
They gave me that one too.
The one on the end.

30:46.832 --> 30:50.418
Environmental Consciousness
Award.

30:50.627 --> 30:54.422
What's that mean? What, you,
like, recycle cans and shit?

30:54.673 --> 30:56.424
I contacted
<i>The Albuquerque Journal... </i>

30:56.633 --> 30:59.427
...and asked what chemicals
they use to bleach their paper.

30:59.636 --> 31:02.722
- Wound up writing an article about it.
- Right on, little bro.

31:02.931 --> 31:05.767
Making mad inroads
with the business community.

31:05.976 --> 31:07.519
All right.

31:07.727 --> 31:09.479
Now, hey, remember...

31:09.688 --> 31:13.483
...not all learning
comes out of books.

31:17.154 --> 31:18.947
Look at you.

31:19.656 --> 31:22.117
You know, we should...
We should hang out more often.

31:22.325 --> 31:26.496
You know, just kick back and chill.

31:26.746 --> 31:31.793
I mean, if you ever, like,
I don't know, need advice.

31:32.252 --> 31:35.922
Because, you know, I've been...
I've been through it all. For real.

31:39.176 --> 31:42.804
Yeah, man, you... You play the flute?

31:43.597 --> 31:47.517
- It's a piccolo, actually.
- Dude, play some Jethro Tull.

31:50.770 --> 31:53.315
Hey, guys, how we doing in here?

31:54.191 --> 31:56.234
We're good.

31:57.861 --> 32:00.572
- Jake?
- Yeah. Fine, Mom.

32:00.780 --> 32:05.452
Well, that's good. That's great.

32:13.043 --> 32:16.755
You know, what the hell?
You see this?

32:17.464 --> 32:19.216
What am I,
some criminal or something?

32:20.258 --> 32:22.969
- Whatever.
- Whatever?

32:23.178 --> 32:25.430
What, you think that's okay?

32:25.639 --> 32:31.061
Like, "Oh, we can't let that scumbag
warp the mind of our favourite son. "

32:31.269 --> 32:32.729
I'm the favourite?

32:34.022 --> 32:35.732
Yeah, right.

32:35.941 --> 32:38.109
You're practically
all they ever talk about.

34:15.498 --> 34:18.627
Oh, snap.

34:19.710 --> 34:21.670
Awesome.

34:54.496 --> 34:56.998
- Yeah?
<i>- Yo, man, it's me.</i>

34:57.541 --> 35:00.919
Hey, listen. You know that product?

35:01.127 --> 35:02.838
You got any more of that?

35:03.046 --> 35:05.131
No, man, okay?
I'm done giving out freebies.

35:05.340 --> 35:07.634
You want charity,
go ask the Salvation Army.

35:07.843 --> 35:09.594
<i>No, no charity. No. </i>

35:09.803 --> 35:12.139
I got this cousin,
he's got him some rich friends.

35:12.347 --> 35:15.100
These dudes are in town,
they're looking to party.

35:15.308 --> 35:18.770
And your stuff is, like, so sweet.

35:18.979 --> 35:20.689
<i>So, what do you say?</i>

35:21.398 --> 35:23.275
You up for making some fat stacks?

35:23.483 --> 35:25.735
Because they'll buy
everything you got.

35:35.829 --> 35:39.457
Yes. Yes. Okay.

35:45.213 --> 35:47.340
Oh, you can't be serious.

35:48.925 --> 35:50.552
What the hell are you doing here?

35:50.760 --> 35:55.432
Yo, I waited till the ball buster left.
I mean, no offence.

35:57.184 --> 35:58.977
Who sent you, huh?

35:59.186 --> 36:00.687
- You wearing a wire?
- Hey. Jesus.

36:00.896 --> 36:02.439
- You setting me up?
- Homo.

36:02.981 --> 36:04.483
A wire? You want a wire?

36:04.691 --> 36:07.444
I got a wire.
Speak into the mike, bitch.

36:07.652 --> 36:09.154
What the hell's wrong with you?

36:09.362 --> 36:11.198
A wire.

36:11.406 --> 36:12.657
Jesus.

36:14.367 --> 36:17.287
- So who did you tell about?
- Nobody. What, are you nuts?

36:17.496 --> 36:19.915
Then why are you here?

36:21.917 --> 36:23.585
I don't know.

36:23.793 --> 36:27.047
To, like, touch base.

36:27.631 --> 36:28.798
Touch base?

36:30.008 --> 36:32.010
Yeah, you know.

36:32.219 --> 36:35.847
What they call a debrief.

36:36.056 --> 36:37.766
Maybe we could, like...

36:37.974 --> 36:39.726
Thought we could debrief.

36:39.935 --> 36:41.770
Debrief?

36:42.229 --> 36:43.772
Wow, that's...

36:43.980 --> 36:47.150
That's what you think we need,
debrief?

36:49.277 --> 36:53.406
Yeah, after what happened,
it just seems like the thing to do.

36:53.615 --> 36:55.575
Kind of, you know, talk about it.

36:55.784 --> 36:58.620
I mean, we can't talk to anybody else.

37:00.121 --> 37:02.874
Anyway, that and I wanted to...

37:03.083 --> 37:04.209
Wanted to, you know...

37:04.417 --> 37:08.338
...tell you how much everybody digs
that meth we cooked.

37:08.922 --> 37:12.592
Everybody digs the meth we cooked.

37:13.635 --> 37:19.683
Seriously. I got dudes that would give
their left nut for a little more.

37:20.183 --> 37:23.061
- Great.
- I'm just saying, I mean, if you ever...

37:23.937 --> 37:25.981
...you know, saw your way clear...

37:26.189 --> 37:32.946
...to, you know,
you and I cooking a little more...

37:41.037 --> 37:42.789
Get the hell off my property.

37:42.998 --> 37:45.750
- What? I'm just saying.
- Go. And don't come back.

37:46.418 --> 37:47.961
Now.

37:50.005 --> 37:51.381
All right.

37:52.048 --> 37:53.675
All right, you know what?

37:53.884 --> 37:55.886
Four grand.

37:56.845 --> 38:00.474
Your share from selling that batch.

38:01.016 --> 38:03.351
That's why I'm here.

38:03.727 --> 38:07.939
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Hey, I didn't smoke it all.

38:32.797 --> 38:35.383
Non-small-cell adenocarcinoma.

38:35.592 --> 38:40.305
Stage 3A, which means it's spread
from the lung to the lymph nodes.

38:40.514 --> 38:42.974
There's no denying it's very serious.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.811
But it... Is it...?

38:46.436 --> 38:48.188
It is...

38:49.022 --> 38:50.357
...curable?

38:51.024 --> 38:53.443
I prefer the word "treatable. "

38:53.902 --> 38:56.988
But the treatments we have
at our disposal can be very effective.

38:57.197 --> 39:00.575
Without making any promises,
I can tell you that the specific course...

39:00.784 --> 39:04.788
...of radiation and chemotherapy I'm
going to suggest has been successful.

39:04.996 --> 39:09.334
In certain cases, it's prolonged a
patient's life and resulted in remission.

39:11.253 --> 39:13.713
What about the side effects?

39:13.922 --> 39:17.425
Well, they can be mild
to practically non-existent.

39:17.634 --> 39:19.511
Or they can be pretty darn awful.

39:19.719 --> 39:23.348
It varies from patient to patient.
Typically, there's hair loss...

39:23.557 --> 39:27.352
...which begins a couple of weeks
after the start of chemotherapy.

39:27.936 --> 39:30.856
You may find yourself unusually
fatigued, not much energy.

39:31.064 --> 39:32.858
You won't want to get out of bed.

39:33.066 --> 39:37.112
You may lose weight due to reduced
appetite and certain intestinal issues.

39:37.320 --> 39:40.490
Muscle aches and pains,
gums will get sore and bleed.

39:40.699 --> 39:44.536
And, of course,
there's the possibility of nausea...

39:44.744 --> 39:48.373
...although we'll prescribe an
antiemetic and try to counteract that.

39:48.582 --> 39:50.375
Possible kidney or bladder irritation.

39:50.584 --> 39:53.044
You may wind up with
increased bruising and bleeding.

39:53.253 --> 39:59.301
There are maybe sexual symptoms.
Your skin may become dry...

40:27.370 --> 40:29.498
Got anything to say?

40:36.171 --> 40:37.589
What do you know about that?

40:39.257 --> 40:41.885
- Nothing.
- Well, that's not gonna fly this time.

40:42.093 --> 40:44.846
How many chances
have we given you?

40:45.055 --> 40:46.890
How many times have we
sat right here...

40:47.098 --> 40:49.559
...and had the same conversation
over and over again?

40:49.768 --> 40:52.229
Where you look us in the eye
and you plead ignorance?

40:52.437 --> 40:54.022
And you play on our emotions...

40:54.231 --> 40:57.400
...and tell us anything and everything
you think we want to hear...

40:57.609 --> 41:00.195
...just so we'll give you
another chance.

41:00.403 --> 41:04.699
And it makes us feel like fools.
Every time.

41:08.745 --> 41:10.997
Enough, Jesse.

41:11.498 --> 41:12.499
Enough.

41:13.959 --> 41:16.628
We are not going to have this
in our house.

41:18.088 --> 41:20.590
We need you to leave.

42:00.005 --> 42:02.215
Thanks for not telling on me.

42:07.053 --> 42:09.431
You think I could have it back?

42:23.904 --> 42:26.323
It's skunk-weed anyway.

42:44.925 --> 42:47.344
<i>The Air Force is aware</i>
<i>of the widely-held belief... </i>

42:47.552 --> 42:50.013
<i>...that some of these</i>
<i>could be flying saucers from... </i>

42:50.222 --> 42:52.474
You know,
this is actually very hopeful.

42:52.682 --> 42:54.392
<i>Nothing conclusive</i>
<i>in the evidence...</i>

42:54.601 --> 42:57.270
<i>...but probing and digesting</i>
<i>of information about UFOs... </i>

42:57.479 --> 42:58.939
<i>...continues unceasingly. </i>

42:59.606 --> 43:00.941
Did you hear me?

43:01.149 --> 43:04.653
I said this is really
very, very hopeful.

43:04.861 --> 43:08.615
<i>Defence Command in</i>
<i>Colorado Springs issued an order... </i>

43:08.824 --> 43:13.328
So can I call them
and tell them you'll start next week?

43:15.580 --> 43:18.041
<i>Even as they did so,</i>
<i>the military wondered whether... </i>

43:18.250 --> 43:20.794
<i>...their scientific know-how</i>
<i>and their best weapons... </i>

43:21.002 --> 43:27.801
<i>...would be effective in any battle</i>
<i>of the Earth versus the flying saucers. </i>

43:28.385 --> 43:33.306
I just think that we need to discuss it
a little more, that's all.

43:33.515 --> 43:35.934
What is there to discuss?

43:36.143 --> 43:39.604
You're gonna get the best treatment,
and he's the best.

43:39.813 --> 43:45.402
Well, there's the money discussion.
I think... No, $90,000 out of pocket.

43:45.610 --> 43:47.445
- Maybe more.
- There's a way, Walt.

43:47.654 --> 43:48.947
There's financing...

43:49.156 --> 43:53.410
...there's instalment plans.
I could always go back to work.

43:53.618 --> 43:57.080
- Walt, there's always a way.
- All right.

43:57.289 --> 44:00.250
Skyler, say that there is a way.

44:00.458 --> 44:03.545
And we spend all that money, and...

44:15.307 --> 44:19.603
Am I supposed to leave you
with all that debt?

44:20.061 --> 44:22.564
No. Honey.

44:22.772 --> 44:26.318
I just don't want emotions ruling us.

44:27.110 --> 44:29.946
Maybe treatment isn't the way to go.

44:31.239 --> 44:34.576
Then why don't you just fucking die,
already?

44:37.746 --> 44:40.165
Just give up and die.

45:29.631 --> 45:32.092
Come on, move your ass.

45:33.510 --> 45:35.512
Name of the guy? You'll like him.

45:37.305 --> 45:40.767
Yeah, dude, I'm not worried.
I got the best fricking attorney.

45:40.976 --> 45:43.478
I would not want to be
on the other side of this one.

45:43.687 --> 45:47.774
He's got this little team of ninjas, too,
that go out and do forward operations...

45:47.983 --> 45:50.110
He's got crap on people.

47:02.933 --> 47:04.267
What the hell?

47:08.688 --> 47:10.649
- What?
- Don't go near it, buddy.

47:10.857 --> 47:14.277
What...? What are you doing?
Call somebody. Call the fire people.

47:14.486 --> 47:16.196
Yeah. I have a fire...

47:16.404 --> 47:19.199
I don't believe this.
Do you know how much I paid for that?

47:24.287 --> 47:26.456
Why are you doing this?

47:27.305 --> 47:33.184
