01:03.665 --> 01:05.432
<i>I never believed in fate</i>

01:06.000 --> 01:09.904
<i>or destiny, kismet,
whatever you want to call it.</i>

01:11.739 --> 01:16.443
<i>Never believed in Santa,
magic, even as a kid.</i>

01:17.411 --> 01:18.613
<i>The supernatural.</i>

01:19.847 --> 01:21.949
<i>God, heaven, hell.</i>

01:23.250 --> 01:23.951
<i>No.</i>

01:27.354 --> 01:29.322
<i>I never believed
in anything really.</i>

01:32.259 --> 01:33.527
<i>And then I met Floyd.</i>

01:38.900 --> 01:41.435
Let's talk about that
for a moment, Sam, if we could.

01:42.036 --> 01:44.304
I believe that's chapter...

01:45.707 --> 01:47.642
Yes, chapter three
from the book.

01:51.578 --> 01:54.381
I don't remember much
of the night I met Floyd.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.552
I remember
that I was intoxicated

01:58.853 --> 02:02.522
and had been since
around 1:30 that afternoon.

02:03.423 --> 02:04.926
Fuck.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.294
<i>I remember that
I couldn't pay my rent again</i>

02:07.561 --> 02:09.731
<i>and that I hadn't paid it
for five months.</i>

02:09.764 --> 02:11.666
It's all over everywhere!

02:11.699 --> 02:15.268
<i>I remember that it had been
a year since Kathleen dumped me.</i>

02:16.804 --> 02:18.840
<i>Almost two since my mother died.</i>

02:21.676 --> 02:25.378
<i>And everything felt incrementally
shittier with each passing day.</i>

02:25.412 --> 02:27.915
Fuck!

02:27.949 --> 02:31.284
<i>And I remember that I took
a brief mental inventory,</i>

02:31.619 --> 02:34.254
<i>considered my overwhelming
lack of prospects,</i>

02:34.756 --> 02:37.257
and in my state
of absolute crapulance...

02:38.592 --> 02:40.527
...came to the superb
conclusion that...

02:43.664 --> 02:45.066
...that it's time to go.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.315
Shit.

07:29.083 --> 07:30.351
Oh, fuck!

07:30.384 --> 07:32.119
Oh, shit.

07:41.062 --> 07:41.962
Oh, shit.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.384
Okay, okay.

08:03.417 --> 08:04.885
Hey, hey, hey.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.921
Hey, okay. Hey. Look at me.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.256
Hey, hey. Hey, son, son.

08:09.290 --> 08:11.225
There's been an accident.
But you look fine.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.293
Everything's fine.

08:15.696 --> 08:16.897
Oh, fuck.

08:19.033 --> 08:20.167
Oh, shit.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.375
Stay with me.
Stay with me. Shit.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.045
Stay with me.

08:33.881 --> 08:37.118
God, God!

08:37.451 --> 08:39.120
God!

10:52.920 --> 10:55.256
<i>It's a goddamn
miracle that the kid's alive.</i>

10:55.889 --> 10:57.958
<i>I would have to say "miraculous"</i>

10:57.992 --> 10:59.927
<i>is the only adequate
description.</i>

11:00.461 --> 11:02.863
<i>So aside from the
bum wrist and the, uh,</i>

11:02.896 --> 11:05.366
- <i>broken ribs.</i>
- <i>Well, there was the associated puncture</i>

11:05.399 --> 11:07.067
<i>of the right lung, of course.</i>

11:07.101 --> 11:08.535
<i>The perforation of the bladder.</i>

11:09.903 --> 11:11.805
- <i>Uh, the bladder is functioning quite well now.</i>
- <i>Hmm.</i>

11:12.439 --> 11:15.309
So he won't need, uh,
diapers or anything

11:15.876 --> 11:17.911
- permanently?
- No, he will not.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.783
Can you smoke in here?

11:24.051 --> 11:25.252
I'm afraid you can't.

11:28.122 --> 11:31.859
He exited the coma at
approximately 9:15 last night.

11:32.593 --> 11:36.930
His last recollection is being in
the city on the day of the accident.

11:37.298 --> 11:43.003
He's lucid, communicative if not somewhat
despondent, which is to be expected.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.106
He will recover.
But I should tell you

11:46.140 --> 11:48.542
that there may be some
hurdles in the near term.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.412
What kind of hurdles?

11:51.445 --> 11:53.615
Oh, he may experience
mood swings,

11:53.648 --> 11:56.850
agitation, occasional confusion,
but, uh...

11:58.352 --> 12:00.054
...that should
dissipate with time.

12:05.959 --> 12:06.860
The brain.

12:08.262 --> 12:10.230
The brain is an incredible
instrument, Floyd,

12:11.365 --> 12:13.635
capable of the most
amazing things.

12:13.668 --> 12:17.371
But for all of its tremendous
power and magnificence,

12:18.038 --> 12:22.543
it is incredibly fragile
and remarkably sensitive.

12:23.277 --> 12:27.848
<i>And miracles aside, with all the
trauma that Samuel has suffered,</i>

12:28.382 --> 12:31.185
<i>it may be some time before
his faculties come back to him.</i>

12:32.052 --> 12:35.889
<i>Truth be told, he may never be
that Samuel again.</i>

12:56.043 --> 12:56.944
How are you doing?

13:04.551 --> 13:05.452
Who are you?

13:08.188 --> 13:09.156
The guy?

13:10.457 --> 13:11.358
My name's Floyd.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.262
Hey.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.035
I guess I should put these
in some water.

13:27.709 --> 13:30.511
You know, a lot of people out
there might frown upon a man

13:30.544 --> 13:32.246
giving another man
some flowers, but...

13:33.815 --> 13:37.151
...you don't have to worry about it.
I'm not sweet on men, nothing like that.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.187
I'm a family man.

13:42.489 --> 13:46.593
And I can assure you that I am definitely a fan of the dames.

13:47.161 --> 13:50.998
So, uh, Sammy,
please accept these flowers.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.200
- Please don't call me that.
- Call you what?

13:54.301 --> 13:57.404
Sammy. Don't call me Sammy.

13:57.438 --> 14:00.474
Sammy? Sammy is one of the greatest
nicknames in the history of mankind.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.143
- Hands down.
- Nobody calls me that.

14:03.177 --> 14:05.479
I prefer Samuel or...

14:07.448 --> 14:08.348
...Sam.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.486
Well, let's go with Sam.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.955
Thank you.

14:16.190 --> 14:18.358
- You really don't like Sammy?
- No, I really don't like it.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.561
Okay.
It's no problem.

14:20.594 --> 14:21.528
I'll call you Sam.

14:29.036 --> 14:34.074
You know, I've been, uh, here quite
a bit since the accident and, uh...

14:35.175 --> 14:36.076
Uh...

14:42.717 --> 14:43.685
I'm sorry I hit you.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.123
It just kind of happened.

14:52.627 --> 14:57.297
I still don't know what...
How... What...

15:03.170 --> 15:05.607
I'm just... I'm just... I'm just
sorry that I... that I hit you.

15:08.810 --> 15:10.210
It's fine. I'm fine.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.714
I'm here, uh...

15:14.147 --> 15:17.084
Besides, I don't remember any of
it, and it could have been worse.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.319
Yeah. Could have been worse.

15:26.393 --> 15:29.631
They said that your father
has not come to this...

15:29.664 --> 15:31.198
I... I don't want
to talk about it.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.535
Okay, I understand.

15:41.408 --> 15:44.211
Dr. Ike told me
that you were a writer.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.084
So I've been thinking, uh...

15:55.289 --> 15:57.190
...Would you consider
writing my biography?

15:59.259 --> 16:01.829
Uh, I don't...

16:03.163 --> 16:04.565
I'm not really, uh...

16:08.201 --> 16:13.140
I mean, thank you for thinking of
me, but I write short stories mostly.

16:13.173 --> 16:17.411
The occasionally essay,
a few poems. Biography?

16:18.613 --> 16:20.080
So you don't think
you can do it?

16:20.581 --> 16:23.383
It's not that I can't do it.
Of course I can do it.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.152
I'm capable. It's just...

16:26.186 --> 16:29.624
It's not my thing, Floyd.

16:30.591 --> 16:32.492
No, I understand, you're
an artist. I respect that.

16:32.526 --> 16:34.294
I can... I can see it
and I can feel it.

16:34.561 --> 16:35.596
But I challenge you.

16:36.965 --> 16:43.503
I challenge you to at least try
for once to do something different.

16:44.438 --> 16:47.642
Because when opportunity knocks on
your door, you might want to answer it,

16:47.909 --> 16:50.243
even if she's
wearing a goofy hat.

16:50.678 --> 16:53.246
- Huh?
- Just hear me out. I spoke to Dr. Ike,

16:53.280 --> 16:55.282
and he explained to me
the situation

16:55.315 --> 16:56.884
you're in with your landlord
in the city.

16:56.918 --> 16:58.686
- Why is he telling you all this?
- No, no, listen,

16:58.720 --> 17:00.454
there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.422
Everybody skips out
on their rent every so often.

17:02.690 --> 17:08.194
It's nothing. What I'm proposing is
that you come and stay with us out here,

17:08.228 --> 17:11.633
me and my family, until you get
yourself back on your feet.

17:12.265 --> 17:17.270
I can give you a cash stipend or a cash advance
if you want to get professional about it.

17:17.304 --> 17:20.907
And... and all you have to do is
concentrate on... on healing up, man.

17:21.575 --> 17:25.278
Just heal up
and write at your own pace.

17:25.311 --> 17:28.816
No deadlines. Just as it comes.

17:29.984 --> 17:31.585
How much of a cash stipend
are we talking?

17:31.619 --> 17:34.689
- How much do you want?
- Uh... um...

17:35.790 --> 17:37.190
Five hundred.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.258
- Five hundred it is.
- Per week.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.292
Dollars?

17:40.227 --> 17:42.262
What do you think I meant?

17:43.430 --> 17:44.699
I know what you meant.

17:50.738 --> 17:53.473
This might sound strange, but...

17:55.342 --> 17:57.411
...I have this funny
feeling that...

17:57.945 --> 18:02.582
<i>He paused for a moment,
pondering it, reconciling.</i>

18:03.450 --> 18:05.185
<i>Before finally admitting</i>

18:05.953 --> 18:07.521
<i>this was meant to be.</i>

18:09.556 --> 18:12.627
I repeated it to myself
in my head several times.

18:13.460 --> 18:19.599
"This was meant to be, this was
meant to be, this was meant to be."

18:20.300 --> 18:22.502
And wondered for just a moment

18:23.004 --> 18:26.406
if there was any possibility
he could be right.

19:09.851 --> 19:10.785
This is it.

19:12.820 --> 19:13.988
Beautiful home, Floyd.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.625
She really is, isn't she?

19:20.628 --> 19:21.796
Come on, let's go meet the kid.

19:24.632 --> 19:26.500
Hey, you all right, pal?

19:29.904 --> 19:30.805
Yeah.

19:32.774 --> 19:33.908
Come on, I'll get your stuff.

19:36.744 --> 19:38.780
Aloha. We're here.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.016
I got that.
Here, take a load off.

19:46.087 --> 19:49.657
Where's the goddamn welcoming committee, Jackie?

19:50.091 --> 19:50.992
Coming.

20:10.711 --> 20:13.346
<i>Jacqueline, Floyd's second wife.</i>

20:13.380 --> 20:15.448
<i>And over a quarter century
his junior.</i>

20:17.018 --> 20:19.921
<i>She was a successful attorney,
and on the partnership track</i>

20:19.954 --> 20:22.089
<i>at Hutchinson,
Zimmer, Wallerstein,</i>

20:22.123 --> 20:23.925
<i>Wallerstein, Cohen and Clemens.</i>

20:25.993 --> 20:28.830
<i>She loved the city,
hated the long commute.</i>

20:28.863 --> 20:30.597
<i>Would often work very late.</i>

20:30.631 --> 20:33.000
<i>She claimed to let the traffic
simmer down.</i>

20:36.671 --> 20:39.807
- Here's my boy, Eddie.
- Edward.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.978
<i>He reminded me of myself.</i>

20:51.551 --> 20:55.957
<i>He was a freshman at St.
Gerard Academy, the youngest in his class.</i>

20:55.990 --> 21:00.828
<i>A dangerous combination of incredible
precociousness and hardwired pessimism.</i>

21:02.096 --> 21:06.433
<i>His penchant for mischief hadn't yet
become a serious cause for concern</i>

21:06.466 --> 21:07.902
<i>between Floyd and Jacqueline.</i>

21:08.669 --> 21:10.771
<i>And though he didn't have
many friends.</i>

21:10.805 --> 21:13.074
<i>He seemed perfectly content
with the fact,</i>

21:13.841 --> 21:17.712
<i>as he said, "People are scared
of me and I like it."</i>

21:21.782 --> 21:25.720
Lily, can you do us a damn kindness
and come downstairs, please?

21:44.872 --> 21:47.608
<i>Lily was Floyd's daughter
from his first marriage.</i>

21:49.210 --> 21:52.479
<i>After graduating from
the music school at Fair Gate,</i>

21:52.512 --> 21:56.183
<i>she experienced a great deal of
difficulty pursuing a legitimate career</i>

21:56.217 --> 21:57.450
<i>as a violinist.</i>

22:04.725 --> 22:09.196
<i>Her growing sorrow helped turn occasional
drinking into frequent cocaine use.</i>

22:09.630 --> 22:13.000
<i>And this culminated in the
inevitable mini breakdown...</i>

22:14.501 --> 22:17.605
<i>...and requisite move back home
to reorganize.</i>

22:22.777 --> 22:23.945
Welcome to the family.

22:25.279 --> 22:29.016
Thank you so, so much.

22:34.288 --> 22:35.455
Very good.

22:58.746 --> 23:03.117
Uh, excuse me, but why
is my silverware so small?

23:05.286 --> 23:08.022
- How do you mean?
- Look, my fork, it's half...

23:10.057 --> 23:10.958
Uh.

23:12.126 --> 23:16.263
It...

23:16.897 --> 23:22.203
I'm... I'm sorry, I didn't, I didn't mean
smaller, I jus... I just meant I, uh...

23:22.937 --> 23:24.071
I meant.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.676
I me... Water.

23:33.314 --> 23:35.515
- Looks delicious, Gloria.
- <i>Gracias.</i>

23:38.085 --> 23:39.754
- You're good?
- Yeah.

23:40.621 --> 23:41.822
Okay, everybody, <i>Mangia</i>.

23:44.058 --> 23:48.729
So, Samuel, Floyd tells me that the two
of you are working together on a book.

23:49.830 --> 23:51.065
How exciting.

23:51.832 --> 23:53.667
I have no idea

23:53.701 --> 23:56.604
what it's about because he won't
give me any details, but...

23:57.271 --> 24:02.575
...I am sure it's going to be
just... sensational.

24:03.077 --> 24:04.779
- It's a secret.
- Mm.

24:05.146 --> 24:09.750
- Is it?
- Mm-hmm. Classified. For now.

24:12.386 --> 24:14.922
May I use the powder room?

24:14.955 --> 24:17.691
- Yes, uh, it's right down the hallway.
- Thank you.

24:17.725 --> 24:20.194
- It's to the... to the left.
- Okay, left.

24:24.732 --> 24:25.699
Dad.

24:25.733 --> 24:27.735
- Mm-hmm?
- Is he okay?

24:27.768 --> 24:28.702
Mm-hmm.

24:29.670 --> 24:32.206
He's fine. Just a little
shaken up, you know,

24:32.973 --> 24:36.911
from the, uh, accident.
Otherwise, he's fine.

24:38.979 --> 24:40.214
Pass the cheese.

24:58.099 --> 24:59.300
Rabbit.

25:24.859 --> 25:26.894
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

25:27.928 --> 25:30.030
- What fuck is that?
- The fuck's what?

25:32.466 --> 25:33.667
Is that a dead rabbit?

25:35.169 --> 25:36.904
Yeah, pretty much.

25:38.339 --> 25:40.207
Jesus fucking Christ. Well, will you...
will you please go back outside

25:40.241 --> 25:41.642
and bury that little fellow?

25:42.076 --> 25:45.813
- Hey, you been smoking again?
- Yep.

25:48.449 --> 25:51.085
You... you gotta quit smoking, man.
That shit's going to kill you.

25:51.118 --> 25:53.821
You're gonna end up like pops.
You want to end up like pops?

25:53.854 --> 25:54.755
Yep.

26:16.510 --> 26:17.945
Just a second.

26:19.480 --> 26:20.915
- Decent?
- Yeah.

26:24.151 --> 26:27.188
Brought you a little something,
a little housewarming, so to speak.

26:27.221 --> 26:30.357
- Floyd, this is completely unnecessary.
- Ah, don't worry about it.

26:30.391 --> 26:31.692
Open it up.

26:43.771 --> 26:44.872
There you go.

26:45.506 --> 26:47.174
Yeah, that's a fine robe.

26:50.945 --> 26:52.079
I don't know what to say.

26:53.247 --> 26:54.281
Nothing to say.

26:55.149 --> 26:56.150
You already thanked me.

26:59.420 --> 27:02.790
Well, thank you again. Really.

27:06.360 --> 27:07.861
All right. I'll leave you to it.

27:13.934 --> 27:15.169
It's good to have you here, pal.

27:56.577 --> 28:00.881
<i>I calculated quickly and figured
that it was very likely a suicide note.</i>

28:01.348 --> 28:02.449
<i>My suicide note.</i>

28:03.685 --> 28:05.386
<i>Of course, I had to assume
that the word "dome"</i>

28:05.919 --> 28:06.854
<i>was meant to be "done."</i>

28:07.554 --> 28:09.223
<i>It was a minor spelling error,</i>

28:09.256 --> 28:11.258
<i>and to be expected
under the circumstances.</i>

28:12.126 --> 28:13.861
<i>I had to forgive myself.</i>

28:42.890 --> 28:47.561
Um, I was never really a bathrobe guy before that.

28:48.429 --> 28:50.230
I've been a bathrobe
guy for ages.

28:50.531 --> 28:54.234
Used to steal them from hotels and...
uh, but now I can afford them.

28:55.336 --> 28:58.005
Barely.

28:58.038 --> 29:00.307
- How about you, Linda?
- I'm a woman, Dick.

29:00.341 --> 29:03.877
I would never have guessed that.

29:06.113 --> 29:07.247
Are we even getting paid
for this?

29:07.281 --> 29:10.351
Mm-mm.

29:10.384 --> 29:13.087
Okay, went off the rails
there for a bit. We're...

29:13.954 --> 29:15.089
Oh, yes.

29:16.256 --> 29:18.359
Floyd's life story.

29:18.392 --> 29:19.627
Right. Well, um...

29:21.562 --> 29:24.565
A few days had passed
before we got to work and

29:25.299 --> 29:27.334
I didn't really know
where to begin.

29:27.601 --> 29:32.139
But then I remembered reading Dmitry
Hardow's book on Francois Lip Shits,

29:32.506 --> 29:34.341
so I figured
I'd do the same thing.

29:34.609 --> 29:38.445
Just, uh, you know,
start interviewing him,

29:39.046 --> 29:41.982
ask him questions,
keep it relaxed and...

29:42.583 --> 29:45.052
...figure the rest
out from there.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.354
I should read the book.

29:57.231 --> 29:58.265
Why the French flag?

29:59.400 --> 30:02.102
Part French on my father's side
and part Indian too.

30:03.036 --> 30:04.071
Potawatomi.

30:05.472 --> 30:08.008
All the way back to the French-Indian
war on that side of the family.

30:11.111 --> 30:12.312
Napoleon?

30:17.719 --> 30:21.221
History has misjudged that man and
I can think of no greater tragedy.

30:21.689 --> 30:22.556
Hmm.

30:25.392 --> 30:27.327
The man's legacy... Hey.

30:28.061 --> 30:29.496
You should be recording this.

30:34.468 --> 30:37.971
Mmm, I haven't touched
this thing in years.

30:40.441 --> 30:43.611
- It's all yours.
- Micro Cassette.

30:47.615 --> 30:50.284
- Always wanted one of these.
- Knock yourself out.

30:54.354 --> 30:55.522
- Okay, let me have that.
- Oh...

30:55.556 --> 30:56.624
- I am sorry.
- Thank you very much.

30:56.658 --> 30:57.591
I didn't mean to, uh...

30:57.625 --> 30:58.559
Yeah, sorry.

30:58.592 --> 30:59.460
I'll change that out.

31:04.565 --> 31:05.599
Fresh take. There you go.

31:08.335 --> 31:10.738
Floyd, you've got a great voice.

31:11.706 --> 31:14.007
I used to be able to carry
a tune, but not anymore.

31:15.710 --> 31:17.377
Do you mind if I s... start?

31:18.245 --> 31:19.146
I'm an open book.

31:22.650 --> 31:27.054
Right, uh, before I do,
regarding the book.

31:27.488 --> 31:28.723
I have to ask.

31:31.626 --> 31:33.360
Why are you keeping it a secret?

31:34.161 --> 31:35.062
Hmm.

31:36.163 --> 31:37.364
It's a good question.

31:41.335 --> 31:44.338
We all live multicolored lives.

31:44.706 --> 31:47.609
Each and every one of us
and, uh...

31:49.510 --> 31:51.478
...we all have a range
of experiences.

31:53.146 --> 31:54.515
- And...
- You've been unfaithful.

31:58.185 --> 32:00.822
Let's not shit in the soup
just yet, my friend, okay?

32:00.855 --> 32:04.191
I mean, we're gonna pull some teeth but let's
try to ease into it a little bit, right?

32:04.224 --> 32:07.729
- Okay.
- For the record, I will say that my wife and I,

32:07.762 --> 32:12.299
we have a great relationship,
really terrific, uh...

32:13.200 --> 32:15.502
But I will admit that, uh,
Jacqueline...

32:17.404 --> 32:19.072
Well, we'll get to that.

32:20.541 --> 32:24.679
But, uh, what I will say is that
I've had some experiences in my life.

32:24.712 --> 32:27.581
Some... some jobs, some things
that I've done that she's...

32:28.850 --> 32:30.551
...not quite aware of per se.

32:31.719 --> 32:32.620
Hmm.

32:34.254 --> 32:35.355
Like what?

32:43.397 --> 32:47.601
Military. Government. Et cetera.

32:49.136 --> 32:51.839
- I'm intrigued.
- Well, there's a lot more where that came from,

32:51.873 --> 32:54.374
and we're gonna get there,
and then you'll understand.

32:54.642 --> 32:57.244
But back to Jacqueline, she...

32:59.146 --> 33:02.215
She also might think that, you know,
me writing my biography is, uh...

33:03.517 --> 33:06.320
- It's a bit, uh...
- Braggadocious?

33:07.655 --> 33:09.824
No, I wouldn't say that.

33:09.857 --> 33:12.259
That's, uh, that's not
the right word for it.

33:12.292 --> 33:14.161
Hmm. Premature?

33:15.562 --> 33:19.232
- No, not that one either.
- Pointless.

33:20.500 --> 33:21.401
Pointless?

33:21.435 --> 33:22.336
Well, I certainly...

33:25.707 --> 33:29.209
I certainly don't feel
that my life has been pointless.

33:29.242 --> 33:31.478
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- No, listen, I've done a lot of...

33:36.516 --> 33:40.287
I've done many great things with my
life, things that I'm very proud of,

33:41.321 --> 33:44.558
and everybody is going to read
about it when the time is right.

33:46.193 --> 33:50.530
Uh, well, uh... Secret's safe.

33:53.901 --> 33:55.903
Um, do you have
a pencil sharpener?

33:56.938 --> 33:58.538
That's a pencil sharpener?

34:00.440 --> 34:01.341
Thank you, sir.

34:17.759 --> 34:18.659
Hey.

34:21.261 --> 34:22.161
Are you all right?

34:25.232 --> 34:25.933
I'm over here.

34:28.502 --> 34:29.603
Over here.

34:43.417 --> 34:47.955
Is that you talking?

34:47.989 --> 34:49.657
Of course,
who do you think it was?

34:49.956 --> 34:51.693
God. God.

34:53.995 --> 34:55.429
What the fuck?

34:55.462 --> 34:56.697
What the fuck is happening?

34:56.731 --> 34:58.866
No, no. Please don't be scared.

34:58.900 --> 35:00.534
I'm just trying to...

35:02.770 --> 35:04.304
You're up early.

35:05.673 --> 35:09.443
Is everything okay? I heard a lot
of yelling and dirty language.

35:09.476 --> 35:10.678
Oh, yeah.

35:11.478 --> 35:14.281
Oh, I'm sorry,
appreciate the concern.

35:14.314 --> 35:18.720
I was, uh, just...
I was, uh... hoo...

35:18.753 --> 35:20.955
I was, uh, doing push ups.

35:22.589 --> 35:23.490
With one arm?

35:24.692 --> 35:26.526
Uh, yeah, just a few.

35:28.562 --> 35:31.598
- I like to stay in shape myself so...
- I can tell.

35:31.632 --> 35:33.333
I mean, yes, obviously.

35:33.366 --> 35:36.336
I mean, I mean, of course,
it's... it's good to...

35:41.441 --> 35:42.476
I should go to work.

35:42.944 --> 35:44.511
Me too. Writing.

35:45.378 --> 35:47.014
- The book.
- Yeah.

35:47.715 --> 35:48.582
The book.

35:50.685 --> 35:51.585
Yeah.

35:55.388 --> 35:56.657
Have a good day, Samuel.

36:02.764 --> 36:05.633
Hey.

36:06.100 --> 36:07.668
- Let's see her. Let's go.
- All right.

36:08.770 --> 36:11.839
Oh, this is, uh, this is
the guy I hit, my biographer.

36:11.873 --> 36:15.375
- Sam. Nick.
- Boy, you did a number on Floyd's caddie.

36:15.643 --> 36:17.377
I didn't think
she was gonna make it.

36:17.645 --> 36:19.847
But we got her all done up like
new for you, inside and out.

36:19.881 --> 36:22.382
I can't wait to see her
because if I got to drive that

36:22.415 --> 36:24.685
goddamn rice grinder
my daughter calls a car

36:24.719 --> 36:26.621
- even one more day...
- There she is.

36:29.624 --> 36:31.424
Well, that's... that's, uh...

36:33.995 --> 36:35.562
That's not the same color,
is it?

36:36.831 --> 36:38.398
Well, about the color, Floyd,
you see, never really matched

36:38.431 --> 36:40.333
the factory tint
on a full repaint.

36:40.668 --> 36:44.872
- So in a certain light, you might find it a little off.
- A little off?

36:45.706 --> 36:47.440
Let me get inside
and start her up for you.

37:04.959 --> 37:05.860
Dammit.

37:23.443 --> 37:26.747
Who hasn't considered a pre-circuit
at some point in your life.

37:29.050 --> 37:31.585
I suppose what kept me away
was thinking about

37:32.019 --> 37:35.890
those guys in those layers of heavy
cloaks in the middle of the summer time.

37:37.859 --> 37:40.995
So that's the reason you didn't
go to the seminary. The clothes?

37:41.829 --> 37:44.397
Well, that and the,
uh, celibacy issue.

37:44.832 --> 37:46.600
That stuff's stuff
what those guys do.

37:47.534 --> 37:49.436
But don't do.

37:50.671 --> 37:53.741
Do you mind if I ask you what you did
before you were writing full time?

37:55.977 --> 37:59.146
Just working for my father
reluctantly.

37:59.579 --> 38:00.480
Doing what?

38:01.581 --> 38:05.753
Franchise operations consultant
was my formal title.

38:06.821 --> 38:08.555
Uncle Pete's Frozen Custard.

38:08.588 --> 38:11.591
He's the CEO. He's Uncle Pete.

38:12.026 --> 38:15.997
He was grooming me to take over the whole
company eventually, but I couldn't stand it,

38:16.463 --> 38:19.566
traveling all over the country
in a shitty suit and tie,

38:19.599 --> 38:22.136
dropping in on franchises
and shitty strip malls,

38:22.169 --> 38:25.873
making sure they're displaying all
their shitty promotional material.

38:25.907 --> 38:29.210
It just... I don't know, the whole
thing depressed the shit out of me.

38:29.243 --> 38:31.411
It made me physically ill.
Seriously.

38:31.846 --> 38:34.649
Anyway, he fired me.
Then a bunch of other bad stuff happened,

38:34.682 --> 38:37.985
with my girlfriend dumping me
and even more bad stuff, so...

38:40.855 --> 38:42.823
...I hate him
and we'll never speak again.

38:44.524 --> 38:46.894
I hated him before he fired me actually,
hated him long before I even worked for him

38:46.928 --> 38:48.663
which is why
I was reluctant to...

38:51.265 --> 38:52.432
Why did you stop?

38:54.936 --> 38:59.472
I... I... I was eating
Uncle Pete's frozen custard

38:59.506 --> 39:01.842
the night of the accident
just before I hit you.

39:01.876 --> 39:06.180
I was eating Uncle Pete's frozen custard,
and it's like my favorite ice cream.

39:07.181 --> 39:08.950
It's everybody's
favorite ice cream.

39:08.983 --> 39:11.252
Why do you think they have
almost 2000 locations?

39:11.285 --> 39:14.587
It's actually not ice cream.
It's custard. There's a difference.

39:14.622 --> 39:18.225
Custard contains pasteurized egg yolks,
which gives it its creamy finish,

39:18.259 --> 39:20.828
- and the machine used...
- Does it not seem strange to you?

39:22.196 --> 39:26.000
No, I mean... not really, no.

39:29.704 --> 39:30.604
I...

39:36.043 --> 39:37.044
Why do you hate him?

39:45.720 --> 39:47.188
That stuff is delicious, man.

39:59.033 --> 40:00.634
I want to show you something.

40:06.573 --> 40:07.274
Who is he?

40:08.242 --> 40:10.077
This is my father.

40:13.881 --> 40:14.915
Yes, indeed.

40:16.317 --> 40:19.220
This old cocksucker
is my dear old dad.

40:20.921 --> 40:22.323
Can he hear us?

40:22.356 --> 40:24.658
Can't hear a goddamn thing.
Can you, pops?

40:27.628 --> 40:28.595
This isn't right.

40:29.030 --> 40:31.699
Exactly. Exactly.

40:34.201 --> 40:36.070
Listen, I don't know
the pertinence on the decline

40:36.103 --> 40:38.773
of your relationship with your
father, and I'm not asking.

40:38.806 --> 40:41.876
I just want to let you know that you
can talk to me about anything any time,

40:41.909 --> 40:44.645
and there will never be
any judgment. Understood?

40:46.347 --> 40:49.150
As far as
this old bag of bones...

40:50.651 --> 40:51.485
...I hate him too.

40:52.219 --> 40:53.921
I just wish
he could hear me say that.

40:58.793 --> 41:00.795
Sometimes family
isn't family at all.

41:03.831 --> 41:05.833
Hey, why don't you, uh,
wait in the car?

41:05.866 --> 41:07.234
- I'll be right down, okay?
- Sure.

41:09.737 --> 41:11.138
- Hey, brother.
- What's up, Floyd?

41:11.672 --> 41:13.040
- Thanks for the help.
- Yeah, my pleasure.

41:13.074 --> 41:15.810
- Here's 20.
- Oh, you, uh, said 50.

41:16.911 --> 41:18.079
- Did I?
- Yeah.

41:19.080 --> 41:19.980
Okay.

41:20.948 --> 41:22.616
Of course I thought
it was his real father.

41:23.050 --> 41:25.219
I had no reason to believe
otherwise. And...

41:28.255 --> 41:29.924
...he got so emotional.

41:33.127 --> 41:34.028
I felt for him.

41:35.863 --> 41:37.298
And I knew he felt for me.

41:38.766 --> 41:40.067
He was coming from a good place.

41:41.902 --> 41:45.106
And he hadn't told you
yet what he did for a living?

41:49.310 --> 41:50.945
He said he was semi-retired,

41:51.679 --> 41:53.614
that he was working
for Grand Bath Martlin.

41:53.981 --> 41:55.716
<i>The government contractor.</i>

42:02.456 --> 42:03.991
Hey, what for the hell
are you doing?

42:04.024 --> 42:05.659
- Do it!
- No, don't do it.

42:05.693 --> 42:07.128
Do it!

42:09.497 --> 42:11.699
Are you fucking kidding me?

42:11.732 --> 42:13.901
You got to go to a hospital
to take that thing off.

42:13.934 --> 42:16.871
I am not going
to that hospital again.

42:16.904 --> 42:18.973
- Ever.
- Oh, it stinks.

42:20.975 --> 42:23.410
- Why aren't you at school?
- Sick.

42:26.313 --> 42:27.915
I got to go to work.

42:27.948 --> 42:29.717
Put an ace bandage on that thing
or something.

42:30.284 --> 42:32.853
- Ridiculous.
- Oh, it's so...

42:33.354 --> 42:34.655
...weak.

42:35.322 --> 42:36.824
And pale.

43:05.386 --> 43:06.287
Don't you agree?

43:08.455 --> 43:12.393
Uh, yeah. Uh, completely.
Absolutely.

43:12.426 --> 43:17.064
It's not like I want to be a
librarian, but I'm just there.

43:17.531 --> 43:18.866
Until I sort things out.

43:19.833 --> 43:23.204
Plus... I love being
surrounded by books.

43:24.471 --> 43:27.141
- Who wouldn't?
- Alright.

43:27.174 --> 43:29.910
You are all set back.

43:30.844 --> 43:31.745
There you go.

43:32.980 --> 43:34.215
Fantastic.

43:34.815 --> 43:35.883
Thank you, Lily.

43:36.150 --> 43:37.318
Hey, uh,

43:37.785 --> 43:39.453
you could always be a nurse.

43:40.888 --> 43:42.323
Fantastic.

43:42.990 --> 43:44.158
Thank you, Lily.

43:45.059 --> 43:47.895
Uh, you can always be a nurse.

43:51.232 --> 43:53.400
Are you ok... Are you okay?
What's wrong?

43:55.002 --> 43:57.371
Did I...

43:58.405 --> 44:05.012
Did I just thank you twice in
a row like exactly the same way?

44:06.213 --> 44:09.416
No. No, just once.

44:10.217 --> 44:11.518
Very nicely.

44:14.321 --> 44:16.190
I'm sorry. It's just...

44:18.092 --> 44:21.528
Still getting
my wits about me.

44:22.563 --> 44:23.464
Yeah, it's okay.

44:24.999 --> 44:26.133
You're doing great.

44:32.006 --> 44:33.440
Do you need anything
before I go?

44:39.046 --> 44:41.448
Well, I am heading
to the library.

44:41.482 --> 44:42.383
I'll see you later.

44:56.063 --> 44:58.399
<i>What made you join the military?</i>

44:58.866 --> 45:00.167
<i>Oh, I was recruited.</i>

45:01.368 --> 45:04.204
<i>The marines, they were
starting a new clandestine unit.</i>

45:04.238 --> 45:06.073
<i>Very small. Very secret.</i>

45:07.742 --> 45:11.378
<i>And they needed, uh, ten men total,
ten men in the whole country.</i>

45:12.647 --> 45:15.015
<i>So they, uh, they went
searching coast to coast.</i>

45:15.049 --> 45:16.850
<i>Wrangled up
about 100 candidates,</i>

45:16.884 --> 45:21.155
<i>and sent us up, uh,
it was up north to Alaska.</i>

45:21.922 --> 45:24.024
<i>Nine months of torture.
Pure torture.</i>

45:24.659 --> 45:27.194
<i>It makes the SEALs look like
nap time at a nursery school.</i>

45:28.195 --> 45:31.031
<i>I really don't know how
I survived it, in fact, uh,</i>

45:31.398 --> 45:33.300
<i>there was a few
recruits that I know...</i>

45:36.570 --> 45:37.471
<i>Sorry.</i>

45:38.640 --> 45:42.042
<i>Uh, there was, uh,
a few young men who died</i>

45:42.076 --> 45:45.045
<i>the first week there on the
Younger York Island.</i>

45:47.047 --> 45:49.416
<i>Anyhow, the last ten
bastards standing</i>

45:49.450 --> 45:52.486
<i>all happened to be Ivy Leaguers
with backgrounds of science.</i>

45:53.420 --> 45:55.289
<i>And it was mostly plastics.</i>

45:56.423 --> 45:57.891
<i>Plastics?</i>

45:59.259 --> 46:01.929
<i>And is that... is that the work
you do now? Uh, plastics?</i>

46:02.396 --> 46:04.398
<i>Yes. So... some plastics.</i>

46:04.965 --> 46:09.970
<i>Some of the work is also with,
uh, lenses. Lenses and lasers.</i>

46:12.005 --> 46:13.040
<i>Wow.</i>

46:14.308 --> 46:17.010
<i>Yeah. It's a...
Yeah, it's amazing stuff.</i>

46:19.480 --> 46:21.048
Hey, maestro. Here you go.

46:21.415 --> 46:22.983
Find your Beethoven right here.

46:23.484 --> 46:27.388
Personally, not a fan, but I got
you some other stuff too.

46:27.722 --> 46:30.357
That musty, old garage down
there, full of treasures.

46:30.391 --> 46:31.659
By the way,
do you play table tennis?

46:33.193 --> 46:34.261
Ping pong?

46:34.495 --> 46:36.664
No, not ping pong, table tennis.

46:37.197 --> 46:39.266
Ping pong is like
the "N" word in our sport.

46:39.299 --> 46:40.234
Table tennis.

46:41.135 --> 46:43.003
Now that you've shed
that plaster cast,

46:43.303 --> 46:46.507
perhaps me and you can, uh,
partake in a little game.

46:47.174 --> 46:49.343
- When you're ready.
- Yeah, sure.

46:49.376 --> 46:50.511
Maybe sometime.

46:51.578 --> 46:52.479
Okay.

46:54.081 --> 46:56.483
- "Natural Sounds of Earth"?
- Oh, yeah,

46:56.517 --> 46:59.353
I picked that out for you because I
know you need to relax a little bit.

46:59.386 --> 47:01.488
This is especially good
when you're having a rough day.

47:01.522 --> 47:05.025
- You just sit back and close your eyes.
- You breathe through it.

47:05.058 --> 47:05.993
Personally,
it's helped me a lot.

47:06.026 --> 47:07.027
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

47:07.361 --> 47:08.262
I'll check it out.

47:09.596 --> 47:11.699
So, how is this coming?

47:13.100 --> 47:18.972
Oh, I, um, uh, I... I haven't really
committed much to the page yet.

47:19.006 --> 47:21.008
I'm s... still
in my discovery face.

47:21.041 --> 47:22.976
No, I can see that.
There's no pressure.

47:24.077 --> 47:25.479
It'll come.

47:25.512 --> 47:28.650
And I've got the general
direction mapped out.

47:28.683 --> 47:30.551
There's um, uh,

47:30.584 --> 47:34.455
so, I mean, yeah, I'm...
I'm... I'm... I'm feeling re...

47:34.488 --> 47:36.624
I'm feeling pretty good
about it, actually.

47:36.658 --> 47:38.626
Okay, well,

47:38.660 --> 47:42.730
that reminds me, I got here $350,
it's all I got on me right now.

47:42.764 --> 47:45.332
- Put the rest on my tab.
- Tab?

47:47.100 --> 47:50.537
- Floyd, it's $300.
- That's $350 there.

47:51.673 --> 47:54.174
- It's $300.
- Okay, my bad. $300.

47:54.208 --> 47:56.376
Put the rest on my tab.
I'll get it to you, like, uh,

47:57.277 --> 48:00.047
Friday, Saturday, but soon,
I'll get it to you soon.

48:00.080 --> 48:02.483
It's fine, whenever.
I know you're good for it.

49:04.311 --> 49:06.313
- Hey, is this the kid?
- This is him.

49:06.681 --> 49:09.516
Did you know, you just can't waltz
into the arena and start bullfighting.

49:09.550 --> 49:12.654
Believe me, I've tried twice.
It's a blood sport we are talking about.

49:12.687 --> 49:15.088
- Mr. Floyd.
- Hey, Sonny, what it be?

49:15.757 --> 49:16.724
What are we doing here?

49:16.758 --> 49:17.725
I'm taking you to lunch.

49:18.325 --> 49:19.226
Oh.

50:10.177 --> 50:11.478
Mm.

50:13.715 --> 50:14.616
Mm.

50:17.217 --> 50:21.588
Look at this. "Beans' big
buckets do it again."

50:22.556 --> 50:25.893
This hulking mass of pure fury
is Lentil Beans Washington.

50:26.928 --> 50:28.863
One of the best basketball
players in the country.

50:29.529 --> 50:31.431
He plays for Eddie's school
at St. Jerry's.

50:48.382 --> 50:50.450
High school basketball
is a very big deal around here.

50:50.685 --> 50:51.585
Very big deal.

50:52.552 --> 50:53.387
You a basketball fan?

50:53.921 --> 50:55.188
Yeah, sure.

50:55.623 --> 50:57.257
- Pros.
- Pros.

50:57.290 --> 50:59.359
There's no purity
in professional basketball.

50:59.393 --> 51:01.528
It's barely any in college.
High school basketball

51:01.561 --> 51:02.930
is where the game
is really played.

51:03.665 --> 51:04.666
At its essence.

51:05.532 --> 51:06.968
Let's check it out.

51:08.703 --> 51:11.405
Boy's made out of metal,
he's a goddamn machine.

51:11.438 --> 51:14.909
- How old is that fucking guy?
- Old enough.

51:18.012 --> 51:18.913
Sit down.

51:20.547 --> 51:22.684
Atta boy, Beans. Atta boy!

51:27.287 --> 51:29.691
What the fuck do you think
you're doing in here?

51:29.957 --> 51:31.926
This is a close practice,
you jagoff.

51:31.959 --> 51:34.194
It's also
a Catholic school, Greg,

51:34.629 --> 51:36.530
one that I pay an exorbitant
amount of tuition for

51:36.563 --> 51:38.666
I might add, Jagoff.

51:39.734 --> 51:41.435
Get the fuck out of here, Floyd.

51:41.468 --> 51:42.770
You fucking jackass.

51:43.570 --> 51:44.806
Door's that way.

51:45.673 --> 51:46.573
Sit down.

51:49.010 --> 51:50.343
- Fucker!
- Hey!

51:53.815 --> 51:54.749
We're leaving.

52:01.421 --> 52:02.589
Hey, Beans...

52:05.459 --> 52:08.295
Hey, Greg,
say hi to your wife from me.

52:08.328 --> 52:10.698
Woo!

52:10.732 --> 52:13.668
Come on. Let's go.
Keep playing, keep playing.

52:24.311 --> 52:26.413
His wife,

52:26.647 --> 52:29.483
she goosed me
at a fundraiser last October,

52:29.516 --> 52:30.718
and he saw the whole thing.

52:31.384 --> 52:33.654
I hit him low!

52:33.688 --> 52:36.590
Okay. Put your arms up.

52:36.624 --> 52:39.627
Put your arms up, breathe,
breathe, breathe. Ah...

52:42.997 --> 52:46.566
Hey, hey. You alright, pal?

52:48.970 --> 52:49.971
Tell me you're OK.

52:51.239 --> 52:56.510
Must have gotten light headed from...
from running.

52:57.577 --> 52:58.478
Jokes.

52:59.714 --> 53:01.749
Yeah. Okay, come on.

53:02.083 --> 53:03.851
Give me a hand. Let me,
let me get you up.

53:04.118 --> 53:05.418
Let me get you to the car.

53:06.988 --> 53:08.522
It's fine. I'm fine.

53:08.956 --> 53:10.524
- I promise.
- You sure?

53:12.860 --> 53:17.665
- Yes. Are you kidding me?
- Totally.

53:19.100 --> 53:20.768
Okay, if you're sure.

53:28.508 --> 53:33.547
Hey, listen, uh, I think Eddie has
a detention again today and, uh...

53:34.548 --> 53:36.583
He might be getting out soon.
So we're gonna wait around

53:36.617 --> 53:39.452
- and give him a ride home, okay?
- Of course.

53:39.486 --> 53:40.955
Is there any orange juice?

53:41.622 --> 53:43.291
Yeah, I'll see what I can find.

53:44.725 --> 53:45.893
I'm gonna get some fresh air.
I'm feeling a little damp myself.

53:52.099 --> 53:54.702
<i>Edward did have
detention again that day</i>

53:55.535 --> 53:56.971
<i>as he would the next day,</i>

53:57.672 --> 54:00.708
<i>and the next,
and many more after that.</i>

54:02.643 --> 54:05.512
<i>But it wasn't Edward
that Floyd was waiting for.</i>

54:07.114 --> 54:08.683
<i>It was Beans.</i>

54:25.066 --> 54:26.366
Hello, stranger.

54:28.069 --> 54:28.970
Santa?

54:29.937 --> 54:32.940
Is... is that you?

54:33.708 --> 54:35.910
No, little boy. It's not Santa.

54:36.543 --> 54:37.945
But I have something for you.

54:38.713 --> 54:40.380
Have you been a good,
little boy?

54:50.625 --> 54:51.524
Are you...

54:52.727 --> 54:55.096
...really in here right now?

54:57.131 --> 54:58.032
I don't know.

54:59.734 --> 55:01.501
Why don't you
touch me and find out?

55:11.112 --> 55:12.713
Is that it?

55:14.514 --> 55:16.183
- Do you want me to touch you?
- Uh-huh.

55:17.151 --> 55:18.619
- On your penis?
- Yeah.

55:19.954 --> 55:21.689
No. Oh my God.

55:21.722 --> 55:23.523
What are you doing? What am
I doing? No, this can't...

55:23.556 --> 55:25.525
Relax. It's okay.

55:26.160 --> 55:29.964
Hey, no, wait. You...
you are married to... to Floyd.

55:29.997 --> 55:33.167
And what... Floyd... No.
He's like...

55:33.901 --> 55:37.104
He's... he's, like, becoming
like... like a father to me now.

55:37.138 --> 55:38.172
Kind of.

55:39.206 --> 55:41.842
He ran you over with his car.

55:43.644 --> 55:46.914
Yeah, but he didn't, like,
he didn't, like, run me over.

55:46.948 --> 55:49.549
- I flew over. It wasn't...
- He won't care.

55:49.984 --> 55:51.018
And he won't know.

55:51.052 --> 55:53.721
We can be quiet and quick.

55:54.288 --> 55:55.656
I don't mind.

55:57.725 --> 55:59.492
Hey... he... I'm sorry.

55:59.526 --> 56:00.895
I... I... Please, I can't.

56:01.896 --> 56:02.830
It's Lily, isn't it?

56:03.297 --> 56:05.933
What? No. Lily?

56:05.967 --> 56:08.703
- You kidding me? Ew.
- You want to fuck her I know.

56:09.804 --> 56:12.773
Look, I love her.

56:13.207 --> 56:14.909
Like my own daughter. I do.

56:15.977 --> 56:21.182
But that girl is a little
fucking coke whore with deep,

56:21.215 --> 56:23.617
dark, deep emotional problems.

56:25.286 --> 56:26.787
I'm just putting that out there.

56:27.154 --> 56:28.089
Okay.

56:29.223 --> 56:30.191
I'm sorry.

56:31.659 --> 56:32.559
Okay.

56:33.794 --> 56:35.696
You're very sex... Pretty.

56:35.730 --> 56:37.098
I... I just...

56:41.568 --> 56:42.269
Uh.

56:43.037 --> 56:44.205
I... I like your robe.

56:45.706 --> 56:48.609
Floyd got it for me.
For Christmas.

56:59.954 --> 57:01.022
I'm sor...

57:01.822 --> 57:02.690
All right.

57:03.224 --> 57:04.191
Sleep tight.

57:45.833 --> 57:46.801
See you soon.

58:18.833 --> 58:20.034
What you looking at?

58:28.809 --> 58:30.344
What are you doing here?

58:31.278 --> 58:33.214
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

58:38.319 --> 58:39.887
You are...

58:42.056 --> 58:43.090
...beautiful.

59:53.127 --> 59:54.795
The cooler!

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.968
Is that...

01:01:47.274 --> 01:01:48.542
Oh, no, no, no.

01:01:55.416 --> 01:01:56.817
I'm sorry.

01:02:12.032 --> 01:02:13.934
It's me.

01:03:09.056 --> 01:03:10.157
Floyd!

01:03:13.728 --> 01:03:14.662
Fuck...

01:03:17.131 --> 01:03:18.132
Floyd!

01:03:21.201 --> 01:03:22.936
- Floyd!
- Yeah. Yeah?

01:03:23.237 --> 01:03:25.607
No, I'm no shark. But I got
a funny feeling about this, Gus.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.007
Yeah, but...

01:03:32.513 --> 01:03:35.516
Uh, Gus, le...
No, no, everything's okay.

01:03:35.549 --> 01:03:37.117
Uh, let me holler back at you.

01:03:37.151 --> 01:03:39.086
Yeah. I'll call you back.

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:40.020
All right, pal.

01:03:41.656 --> 01:03:43.223
You all right?

01:03:43.257 --> 01:03:45.125
- Huh? Okay.
- I had a horrible nightmare.

01:03:45.159 --> 01:03:47.561
- What? Tell me what happened.
- I had a horrible nightmare.

01:03:47.594 --> 01:03:52.466
<i>I told him about the dream...
and how this one was very different.</i>

01:03:53.367 --> 01:03:56.003
<i>Felt different.
Like it was real.</i>

01:03:58.005 --> 01:04:00.374
<i>I told him about Lily and...</i>

01:04:01.341 --> 01:04:02.376
<i>...the demon.</i>

01:04:04.144 --> 01:04:06.346
<i>I told him about
falling and, um...</i>

01:04:07.514 --> 01:04:10.050
<i>...watching myself die...</i>

01:04:11.719 --> 01:04:13.120
<i>...and about the painting.</i>

01:04:14.756 --> 01:04:16.557
<i>I didn't know if...</i>

01:04:18.793 --> 01:04:23.397
<i>...if the place was haunted...
or if it was me.</i>

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:31.338
He said he had some background
in parapsychology.

01:04:31.639 --> 01:04:34.274
"More than just armchair,"
is how he put it.

01:04:35.042 --> 01:04:36.276
Wanted to give me some tests.

01:04:37.444 --> 01:04:39.213
What kind of tests?

01:04:40.113 --> 01:04:45.319
Uh, there were shapes, uh,
geometric shapes.

01:04:46.621 --> 01:04:50.991
Uh, just drawings of animals.

01:04:54.394 --> 01:04:55.295
Is it a llama?

01:04:55.329 --> 01:04:56.731
No, but close.

01:04:57.397 --> 01:04:58.666
It's not a llama,
it's an alpaca.

01:04:59.233 --> 01:05:01.401
Very similar, but not the same.

01:05:05.372 --> 01:05:07.675
- It's a penny.
- It's not just any penny.

01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:12.179
This little fellow,
he was minted in 1909.

01:05:12.212 --> 01:05:15.549
It's worth a couple thousands bucks.
In perfect condition.

01:05:16.818 --> 01:05:20.320
And it was in perfect condition until
my Lily painted this heart on it.

01:05:21.522 --> 01:05:24.258
She was a little girl.
She thought that would make me happy.

01:05:25.627 --> 01:05:27.427
Now, it's technically worthless.

01:05:30.765 --> 01:05:32.165
But it's priceless to me.

01:05:34.769 --> 01:05:36.336
I'm gonna ask you
to do something.

01:05:37.304 --> 01:05:38.606
When I give you the go ahead.

01:05:39.273 --> 01:05:40.808
I want you to close your eyes.

01:05:40.842 --> 01:05:42.376
I want you
to take a deep breath.

01:05:43.811 --> 01:05:47.514
And I want you to count down
from six to zero.

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:53.688
And when you open your eyes,
you're gonna focus on this penny.

01:05:55.522 --> 01:05:56.658
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:05:57.224 --> 01:05:58.158
Okay.

01:06:02.129 --> 01:06:03.363
And...

01:06:03.397 --> 01:06:05.532
Six.

01:06:06.333 --> 01:06:07.234
Five.

01:06:08.168 --> 01:06:09.069
Four.

01:06:09.737 --> 01:06:10.638
Three.

01:06:11.606 --> 01:06:12.506
Two.

01:06:13.273 --> 01:06:14.174
One.

01:06:15.142 --> 01:06:16.143
Zero.

01:06:30.257 --> 01:06:31.859
Yes! Yes!

01:06:31.893 --> 01:06:34.528
I haven't finished reading
but you have to tell me.

01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:36.430
Where did it go?

01:06:37.531 --> 01:06:40.133
Uh, well, I guess you'll
just have to finish reading.

01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:42.837
Um, what do you think so far?

01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:44.404
I haven't read it.

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.275
- But you just said...
- My assistance's reading it.

01:06:48.308 --> 01:06:49.744
She loves it. I love it.

01:06:50.678 --> 01:06:52.412
- We want it.
- You...

01:06:53.615 --> 01:06:54.616
Really?

01:06:55.382 --> 01:06:56.618
Oh my.

01:06:57.952 --> 01:07:00.655
Wow.

01:07:00.688 --> 01:07:02.389
I'm gonna be published.

01:07:02.957 --> 01:07:06.226
- But wait, if she hasn't...
- Doesn't matter, we want it.

01:07:06.259 --> 01:07:08.362
We want you.
You're a bestseller.

01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:12.132
Watch, we're already talking
movie rights.

01:07:12.667 --> 01:07:14.836
- What is that?
- It's French. The whole package.

01:07:14.869 --> 01:07:16.603
Now tell me what happened.

01:07:38.726 --> 01:07:40.594
- Shit.
- What's that?

01:07:41.428 --> 01:07:42.697
A little louder.

01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:45.900
I feel like shit.

01:07:45.933 --> 01:07:48.870
Oh, don't worry. Eddie's coming up
with a Falkenhagen and two quasidream.

01:07:48.903 --> 01:07:49.804
You'll feel better.

01:07:55.475 --> 01:07:56.911
I'm sorry, Floyd.

01:07:57.612 --> 01:08:00.514
- What are you sorry about?
- About your penny.

01:08:00.547 --> 01:08:02.582
- My penny?
- It's priceless.

01:08:02.617 --> 01:08:04.484
- Now it's gone.
- Priceless?

01:08:04.518 --> 01:08:06.486
That was just a figure
of speech. It's just a penny.

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.956
What was priceless is
what just happened out there.

01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:12.727
That was like a one in a million thing. Less
than that, it was like one in 100 million.

01:08:13.293 --> 01:08:14.729
That was very special stuff.

01:08:16.831 --> 01:08:17.732
That was magic.

01:08:23.004 --> 01:08:25.238
Do you realize that
we can make a killing with that?

01:08:25.272 --> 01:08:26.406
There's some serious money.

01:08:28.274 --> 01:08:29.341
Plenty of pennies.

01:08:31.011 --> 01:08:33.915
You have a precious talent.

01:08:34.381 --> 01:08:37.484
You have a gift, and you can
call it what you want,

01:08:37.517 --> 01:08:38.685
- but if we...
- A curse.

01:08:39.386 --> 01:08:41.388
I call it a fucking curse.

01:08:45.392 --> 01:08:46.961
- What is this?
- Beer.

01:08:47.995 --> 01:08:49.029
Thank you.

01:08:49.063 --> 01:08:50.965
Okay. You got two?

01:08:52.033 --> 01:08:52.934
All right, thanks.

01:08:54.801 --> 01:08:55.770
What are you doing?

01:08:57.104 --> 01:08:59.941
Just what you told me to.
Brought the beer and the sinus pills.

01:09:03.343 --> 01:09:04.444
Feel better.

01:09:12.486 --> 01:09:16.423
I usually buy American, but the
Falkenhagen's got special ingredients.

01:09:16.456 --> 01:09:18.558
It's gonna settle your stomach.
And the quasidream,

01:09:18.591 --> 01:09:19.993
it's going to clear your head.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.697
Those two little fuckers are
gonna cut right through the fog.

01:09:22.729 --> 01:09:23.663
Go ahead. Take them.

01:09:27.769 --> 01:09:28.736
There you go.

01:09:31.906 --> 01:09:35.308
Good. Sam, listen to me
very carefully.

01:09:35.341 --> 01:09:39.613
Floyd, I am not going
to do it again ever.

01:09:39.647 --> 01:09:43.350
So don't ask, and please...

01:09:43.383 --> 01:09:45.385
- That's okay.
- Please don't tell anyone.

01:09:45.417 --> 01:09:47.520
I'm not gonna tell anybody.
Why would I tell anybody?

01:09:47.554 --> 01:09:49.055
I don't know.
But everything is different now

01:09:49.090 --> 01:09:51.457
after the accident.
Nothing's normal.

01:09:51.826 --> 01:09:54.662
- Listen, you want to see Dr. Ike?
- I'm not going to a hospital.

01:09:54.695 --> 01:09:56.396
Okay.
You're not going to a hospital.

01:09:56.931 --> 01:09:58.331
I just want you to feel better.

01:09:58.933 --> 01:10:01.803
- I'm crazy.
- Everything's crazy.

01:10:02.036 --> 01:10:03.470
And that's normal.

01:10:04.972 --> 01:10:06.674
You're gonna
get through this, pal.

01:10:07.642 --> 01:10:08.542
Okay?

01:10:51.551 --> 01:10:55.522
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

01:10:56.123 --> 01:10:58.525
I'm not okay at all.

01:11:01.796 --> 01:11:04.665
<i>From under the cover of my bed
sheet, I explained to Floyd</i>

01:11:04.699 --> 01:11:07.601
<i>that a most severe depression
had consumed me,</i>

01:11:07.835 --> 01:11:11.072
<i>and that it would be entirely
impossible for me to face anybody.</i>

01:11:11.672 --> 01:11:14.374
<i>For how long? I didn't yet know.</i>

01:11:15.475 --> 01:11:18.045
<i>I asked for some time away
from our work on the book.</i>

01:11:18.478 --> 01:11:21.381
<i>He immediately obliged
and then left me alone.</i>

01:11:32.727 --> 01:11:36.596
<i>Though he wouldn't tell me then, for fear of
further degrading my delicate mental condition.</i>

01:11:40.668 --> 01:11:42.803
<i>He found the penny
at the end of the driveway.</i>

01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:48.776
<i>Special stuff indeed.</i>

01:12:02.657 --> 01:12:04.557
<i>I stayed in that room for days.</i>

01:12:04.959 --> 01:12:06.694
<i>I have no idea how many.</i>

01:12:09.997 --> 01:12:12.166
<i>And I didn't have
an appetite for anything.</i>

01:12:19.974 --> 01:12:22.877
<i>An impossible darkness
had descended upon me.</i>

01:12:24.979 --> 01:12:29.516
<i>My conversations with Santa became
more frequent, almost constant,</i>

01:12:29.549 --> 01:12:34.789
<i>and gradually took on a tone that
could only be described as adversarial.</i>

01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:37.758
You want me gone, don't you?

01:12:38.192 --> 01:12:41.028
<i>Say it! Say it! Just say it!</i>

01:12:41.062 --> 01:12:44.564
<i>You stinking little shitty,
little fuzzy, fucking fussy!</i>

01:12:44.799 --> 01:12:49.770
<i>Say it, "I'll do it. You know
I will."</i> <i>Just say it!</i>

01:12:50.304 --> 01:12:52.039
Getting really
tired of this, Sam.

01:12:52.673 --> 01:12:54.742
I've been trying to help you.

01:12:56.777 --> 01:12:58.212
<i>One of us had to go.</i>

01:13:09.991 --> 01:13:11.792
Stop it. Stop it.

01:13:12.226 --> 01:13:15.029
Stop it! I don't...
Stop it!

01:13:27.675 --> 01:13:29.576
Are you...

01:13:31.846 --> 01:13:34.181
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Oh.

01:13:41.155 --> 01:13:42.790
<i>Eventually, I let Floyd in.</i>

01:13:43.057 --> 01:13:44.692
<i>He suggested that we talk,</i>

01:13:45.026 --> 01:13:48.996
<i>and after my initial refusal,
we did. For hours.</i>

01:13:49.864 --> 01:13:54.101
<i>He had no idea where Santa came from or
why he was in there in the first place.</i>

01:13:54.335 --> 01:13:56.737
<i>Especially
outside of the season.</i>

01:13:57.171 --> 01:13:58.873
<i>Nonetheless, we continued,</i>

01:13:58.906 --> 01:14:01.642
<i>and I revealed things to him
on that day</i>

01:14:01.675 --> 01:14:03.210
<i>that I've never revealed
to anyone.</i>

01:14:04.045 --> 01:14:06.647
<i>It helped me a great deal.</i>

01:14:41.315 --> 01:14:43.684
I wasn't with Floyd on
the night of the big game.

01:14:44.952 --> 01:14:47.354
Though I had begun to feel
a bit more like myself,

01:14:47.388 --> 01:14:49.223
I wasn't out of the woods.
Not yet.

01:14:50.357 --> 01:14:52.093
<i>I walked alone into town</i>

01:14:52.126 --> 01:14:54.361
<i>to the King's Imperial Theater
on Main Street.</i>

01:14:54.995 --> 01:14:58.199
<i>They were screening a restored
print of</i> Victory, Oh, Victory

01:14:58.232 --> 01:15:00.968
<i>by the Austro-Bavarian
director Jan Vogelweide.</i>

01:15:25.159 --> 01:15:27.061
Turn it up.
Turn it up. Turn it up.

01:15:27.695 --> 01:15:30.798
- Turn it up.
- Hey, I meant to ask you, how's the, uh,

01:15:30.831 --> 01:15:33.367
- bibliography coming along?
- Not now, Roy. Not now.

01:15:34.034 --> 01:15:36.170
Well, folks, St.
Jerry's face crosstown rival

01:15:36.203 --> 01:15:37.738
Northeast High tonight.

01:15:37.771 --> 01:15:40.274
And, uh, jeesh,
where do we begin?

01:15:40.307 --> 01:15:45.813
National phenom Beans Washington
turned in an absolutely abysmal

01:15:45.846 --> 01:15:47.982
five points on 57 attempts.

01:15:48.349 --> 01:15:50.784
Yeah, you heard that right.

01:15:54.488 --> 01:15:57.324
<i>It was his lowest point
total since the second grade,</i>

01:15:57.958 --> 01:16:01.996
<i>a striking aberration in the season
where he averaged over 50 points a game.</i>

01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:04.265
<i>When questioned afterward,</i>

01:16:04.298 --> 01:16:05.966
<i>he stated
with complete certainty,</i>

01:16:06.767 --> 01:16:08.702
<i>"I'm definitely
catching that pink eye."</i>

01:16:08.969 --> 01:16:12.039
<i>Despite little to no outward
appearance of discoloration.</i>

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:17.711
<i>Greg Osterhoudt was promptly relieved of
his coaching duties the following morning.</i>

01:16:18.345 --> 01:16:20.848
<i>It was their worst loss
in seven seasons.</i>

01:16:28.889 --> 01:16:30.157
Traitor!

01:16:30.891 --> 01:16:32.793
Shut the fuck up, Jimmy!

01:16:32.826 --> 01:16:34.128
Shut the fuck up!

01:16:34.495 --> 01:16:36.230
Yes, yes!

01:16:46.173 --> 01:16:47.074
Count it.

01:16:51.045 --> 01:16:52.746
That should take care of my tab.

01:16:56.483 --> 01:16:59.787
- There's an extra 100.
- Performance bonus.

01:17:00.854 --> 01:17:04.058
I'm gonna take you to dinner in the city.
I got this great, little Italian joint.

01:17:04.091 --> 01:17:05.426
I want you to meet somebody.

01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:44.458
- How are you, my love?
- Good.

01:18:44.491 --> 01:18:45.592
Good.

01:18:46.661 --> 01:18:49.596
Samuel, this is Kimmi Hamasaki,
my acupuncturist.

01:18:50.164 --> 01:18:51.098
Best in the city.

01:18:53.033 --> 01:18:54.902
This is Samuel, my biographer.

01:18:54.935 --> 01:18:56.403
The young man I hit with my car.

01:18:57.404 --> 01:18:59.873
Uh... uh, wow, um.

01:19:00.974 --> 01:19:03.277
It's a...
It's so nice to meet you.

01:19:04.545 --> 01:19:07.114
Floyd told me so much about you.

01:19:16.523 --> 01:19:20.327
She is also an expert in shiatsu

01:19:20.961 --> 01:19:24.565
- and other forms of...
- Eastern massage.

01:19:24.598 --> 01:19:27.368
That's right, Eastern massage.
That's what we like to call it.

01:19:27.401 --> 01:19:28.636
Oh.

01:19:32.206 --> 01:19:34.274
Will you gentlemen excuse me?

01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:37.211
- I'm going to.
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:38.479 --> 01:19:39.480
Hurry back.

01:19:45.486 --> 01:19:46.387
Mm.

01:19:48.956 --> 01:19:52.192
- She's something.
- Yeah, definitely something.

01:19:52.559 --> 01:19:54.328
Floyd, what exactly is she?

01:19:54.696 --> 01:19:57.331
- You didn't get her for me?
- I'm in love with her, pal.

01:19:59.266 --> 01:20:00.167
Got it really bad.

01:20:03.971 --> 01:20:05.506
I'm gonna say something to you
off the record.

01:20:07.408 --> 01:20:10.277
Me and Jacqueline, it's not
really working right now.

01:20:10.745 --> 01:20:12.479
The waters are choppy,
you understand?

01:20:14.448 --> 01:20:16.984
Listen, relationships
are strange.

01:20:17.017 --> 01:20:19.920
It's like an enigma.
Women are an enigma.

01:20:20.354 --> 01:20:22.089
No, women are more
like a riddle.

01:20:23.123 --> 01:20:26.326
The whole goddamn
thing is a... is a conundrum.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:27.261
That's what it is.

01:20:28.195 --> 01:20:29.631
A man, he has to eat, right?

01:20:30.998 --> 01:20:33.567
And when there's no food at home,
he's got to go out for dinner.

01:20:40.174 --> 01:20:42.376
Personally I don't like
their cars very much.

01:20:42.409 --> 01:20:44.077
But the Japanese people...

01:20:45.613 --> 01:20:49.116
...they have this relentless pursuit
for absolute perfection in everything.

01:20:50.017 --> 01:20:53.086
I mean, and the women...
I'm telling you, man,

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.221
it's like...

01:20:55.589 --> 01:20:57.057
What a culture.

01:20:58.091 --> 01:20:59.293
Yeah.

01:21:01.261 --> 01:21:02.463
How's the mac and cheese?

01:21:08.368 --> 01:21:11.706
So I said, "Honey, you can't make peanut butter
cookies without a little peanut butter."

01:21:13.474 --> 01:21:14.541
Oh, here you go.

01:21:18.545 --> 01:21:20.147
Who the fuck
is this little fruit?

01:21:21.515 --> 01:21:22.617
This is Bobby.

01:21:23.885 --> 01:21:26.987
- This is the assistant tennis pro?
- Try paralegal, dude.

01:21:27.689 --> 01:21:29.523
- Dude?
- Yeah, dude.

01:21:32.459 --> 01:21:34.696
- Look who has a sense of humor.
- What the fuck, man?

01:21:35.229 --> 01:21:38.599
I'll fucking sue your ass. I work at a law firm, fuck face.

01:21:38.633 --> 01:21:40.735
Bobby, I would like you
to meet my husband, Floyd.

01:21:41.368 --> 01:21:44.004
Oh, and his female friend
from the "Rub and tug."

01:21:44.606 --> 01:21:46.808
- What's your name, sweetie?
- I am Kimmi.

01:21:46.841 --> 01:21:47.742
I'm sorry.

01:21:49.142 --> 01:21:50.544
And this is Samuel.

01:21:50.577 --> 01:21:52.279
My husband's victim
in a vehicular assault

01:21:52.312 --> 01:21:54.248
which resulted
in a traumatic brain injury.

01:21:54.682 --> 01:21:56.149
What's up?

01:21:57.451 --> 01:22:00.187
Well, it was nice
seeing all of you.

01:22:01.188 --> 01:22:02.089
Night, night.

01:22:05.292 --> 01:22:06.193
Hey, Bobby boy.

01:22:08.395 --> 01:22:09.429
Forgot your purse.

01:22:10.597 --> 01:22:11.699
Here you go.

01:22:18.405 --> 01:22:19.306
Fuck!

01:22:20.608 --> 01:22:22.509
- Come on, baby.
- My papers...

01:22:22.543 --> 01:22:24.344
What papers? Leave them!

01:23:54.201 --> 01:23:55.502
I'd like to apologize.

01:23:58.405 --> 01:24:00.742
I yelled at you
when I was going crazy.

01:24:01.776 --> 01:24:03.243
You were just concerned.

01:24:03.945 --> 01:24:05.178
You didn't deserve it.

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:07.849
I'm sure I frightened you.

01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:11.551
I know you're mad at me.

01:24:14.622 --> 01:24:16.156
You're really
very sweet.

01:24:17.959 --> 01:24:20.193
I... I can't stop thinking
about it.

01:24:20.227 --> 01:24:21.696
I feel terrible, so...

01:24:29.369 --> 01:24:32.640
Uh, will you... will you please
forgive me?

01:24:35.877 --> 01:24:37.444
It's... it's fake.

01:24:39.479 --> 01:24:40.380
It's silk.

01:24:41.548 --> 01:24:43.517
It's real. It's just silk.

01:24:47.254 --> 01:24:48.588
Smells like a real rose.

01:24:48.623 --> 01:24:50.992
Yeah, they must spray them
or I don't know.

01:24:51.025 --> 01:24:53.393
I would... I...
I wouldn't get too close.

01:24:53.427 --> 01:24:55.630
Might give you a rash or something.

01:25:05.707 --> 01:25:09.276
Thank you for my smelly,
little rose.

01:25:11.713 --> 01:25:13.313
And thank you for apologizing.

01:25:15.016 --> 01:25:15.950
So...

01:25:17.685 --> 01:25:18.953
...you forgive me?

01:25:27.394 --> 01:25:29.797
Cool.

01:25:31.899 --> 01:25:34.635
<i>Floyd found it to be a
terribly haunting coincidence</i>

01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:36.904
<i>that on the night
of our accident</i>

01:25:36.938 --> 01:25:40.007
<i>he was enjoying a delicious
uncle Pete's frozen custard,</i>

01:25:40.041 --> 01:25:44.377
<i>and my father happened to be the
founder CEO and corporate namesake.</i>

01:25:44.812 --> 01:25:49.483
<i>This vexed him greatly and he mentioned
it to me several times during my stay,</i>

01:25:49.516 --> 01:25:53.755
<i>always befuddled, insisting that
there must be a connection.</i>

01:25:54.756 --> 01:25:56.423
<i>I didn't think so at the time...</i>

01:25:58.659 --> 01:26:01.829
<i>...as the fates would have it,
whomsoever they might be,</i>

01:26:01.863 --> 01:26:04.866
<i>it just so happened
that Beans was also enjoying</i>

01:26:04.899 --> 01:26:07.068
<i>a delicious
uncle Pete's frozen custard</i>

01:26:07.101 --> 01:26:10.303
<i>on what could be considered
an equally momentous evening.</i>

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:14.776
Bro, don't... come on, don't do that.

01:26:14.809 --> 01:26:15.877
Excuse me a moment, sir.

01:26:16.978 --> 01:26:18.378
Lentil Washington, I presume?

01:26:19.781 --> 01:26:22.850
We've been following your career
for quite some time, Mr. Washington.

01:26:24.719 --> 01:26:26.486
You an agent or somethin' like
that?

01:26:26.754 --> 01:26:27.755
Something like that.

01:26:28.890 --> 01:26:31.424
The man I work for is incredibly
wealthy, very powerful,

01:26:32.026 --> 01:26:33.728
and he's taken
a great interest in you.

01:26:34.662 --> 01:26:37.665
He request your audience this
evening if you'd be so inclined.

01:26:37.698 --> 01:26:40.902
- Of course.
- Yeah, why not?

01:26:41.636 --> 01:26:44.672
I'm sorry. We're gonna have to ask your
friend to stay behind this evening.

01:26:44.705 --> 01:26:47.074
- Come on, man. I'm his body guard.
- Chill, chill, man, it's...

01:26:48.142 --> 01:26:50.611
- Look, I'll holler at you.
- All right, man.

01:27:29.583 --> 01:27:31.719
Hello?

01:27:34.421 --> 01:27:35.555
Yeah, I'll accept the call.

01:27:37.992 --> 01:27:39.827
Hey, hey, hold... slow down.

01:27:39.861 --> 01:27:41.162
I can't understand a word
you're saying, you know,

01:27:41.195 --> 01:27:42.930
you're crying, the tears
and all that.

01:27:44.065 --> 01:27:44.999
Who fucked you up?

01:27:46.533 --> 01:27:49.402
What... What do you mean you don't know
what happened? Wha... What happened?

01:27:50.872 --> 01:27:52.539
You were at Uncle Pete's
custard?

01:27:52.572 --> 01:27:54.008
Tha... That's a delicious
custard.

01:27:54.474 --> 01:27:57.011
You know, my biographer, he's,
uh, his father was the one...

01:27:57.044 --> 01:27:58.646
Okay. Yeah. Sorry, go ahead.

01:27:58.679 --> 01:27:59.680
Tell me what happened.

01:28:01.514 --> 01:28:03.583
They took you... Where did they
take you for a ride?

01:28:04.551 --> 01:28:05.786
They put a sack on your head?

01:28:07.622 --> 01:28:09.023
What kind of shot
did they give you?

01:28:10.157 --> 01:28:11.792
What do you mean
you don't remember?

01:28:13.794 --> 01:28:15.696
You started talking.
Okay, listen, Beans.

01:28:16.163 --> 01:28:17.765
Listen to me very carefully.

01:28:17.798 --> 01:28:19.499
Did you mention my name?

01:28:21.302 --> 01:28:23.905
What do you mean you don't know? You either
mentioned my name or you didn't mention my name.

01:28:25.706 --> 01:28:27.975
Well, what do you know?
Tell me wha... what you remember?

01:28:29.509 --> 01:28:31.612
So, you're all bruised up.
The bruises go away quickly.

01:28:31.646 --> 01:28:34.715
Just have to get some rest, okay?
Just go home and get some rest.

01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:37.785
They left you naked
in the street?

01:28:39.654 --> 01:28:41.122
Oh, racist bastards.

01:28:41.756 --> 01:28:44.759
Okay, listen to me. You gotta
get some clothes or a top or...

01:28:44.792 --> 01:28:45.927
or put a hat on that thing.

01:28:47.061 --> 01:28:47.962
Beans.

01:28:48.495 --> 01:28:49.797
Do you hear what I... Beans?

01:28:51.498 --> 01:28:52.967
Fuck. Beans?

01:28:53.768 --> 01:28:54.969
Goddamn it.

01:29:05.279 --> 01:29:07.648
<i>I remember
stopping, wiped off my goggles.</i>

01:29:07.682 --> 01:29:09.717
<i>And I looked back at Tex.</i>

01:29:10.818 --> 01:29:12.887
<i>And the poor guy was barely
hanging on behind me.</i>

01:29:13.688 --> 01:29:16.223
<i>I knew right then and there,
he was gonna loose both hands.</i>

01:29:17.024 --> 01:29:21.662
<i>So I took out my serrated knife
and held his head in my hand.</i>

01:29:21.696 --> 01:29:22.363
Hey.

01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:24.865
What the fuck?

01:29:27.201 --> 01:29:28.736
I hadn't heard that one.

01:29:30.071 --> 01:29:31.906
I'm sure he'll tell you
himself someday.

01:29:33.674 --> 01:29:34.675
Doubt it.

01:30:22.589 --> 01:30:23.891
...there's a note on my locker.

01:30:24.225 --> 01:30:26.660
I mean, how passive egregious
can you be?

01:30:26.961 --> 01:30:29.130
Right? Then, Murph accuses me
of stealing his comb.

01:30:29.630 --> 01:30:30.898
I mean, why would I steal
his comb?

01:30:30.931 --> 01:30:32.266
I got my own damn comb
right here.

01:30:36.737 --> 01:30:38.139
You feeling all right, Floyd?

01:30:38.172 --> 01:30:40.041
You seem like you're not
feeling, uh...

01:30:40.941 --> 01:30:42.309
Well, you're not
feeling alright.

01:30:44.979 --> 01:30:47.214
Had a meatball hoagie for lunch.

01:30:47.248 --> 01:30:50.651
Went sour on me.
I might have to shed a tear.

01:30:51.986 --> 01:30:54.622
Let it out. That's me here.

01:30:58.692 --> 01:30:59.960
Thanks for the lift, Floyd.

01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:17.344
So,
he was named after his mother.

01:31:17.378 --> 01:31:19.146
Uh, yes, Florence.

01:31:19.947 --> 01:31:22.650
But he had gone by
Floyd since he was very young.

01:31:22.683 --> 01:31:24.085
- For obvious reasons.
- Hmm.

01:31:24.652 --> 01:31:26.654
- Children can be so cruel.
- Hmm.

01:31:28.022 --> 01:31:31.992
And you weren't aware
of any of his other aliases?

01:31:32.026 --> 01:31:36.197
No, I wasn't aware of any of that, uh...
that side of things, uh...

01:31:37.431 --> 01:31:40.034
Until the afternoon
that we met Anselm

01:31:43.104 --> 01:31:45.973
You know what the word "chaos" means?

01:31:47.241 --> 01:31:49.143
- "Chaos?"
- I have an idea.

01:31:49.176 --> 01:31:54.014
Yeah, it's, uh,
total lack of order? Mayhem?

01:31:54.448 --> 01:31:58.319
Yeah, uh, but it's also the stuff that
existed before the universe was born.

01:31:59.353 --> 01:32:03.090
The Ancient Greeks, they thought
that we all came from chaos.

01:32:03.124 --> 01:32:04.058
Floyd!

01:32:07.328 --> 01:32:08.229
Who the fuck is that?

01:32:30.619 --> 01:32:33.354
Well, there seems to be, uh,
some sort of, uh...

01:32:33.888 --> 01:32:38.659
...misunderstanding, and I'm prepared
to clear things up by phone anytime.

01:32:40.027 --> 01:32:41.929
I'm afraid that won't work.

01:32:42.429 --> 01:32:43.864
Oh, shit.

01:32:48.269 --> 01:32:51.305
Do you mind if I bring my biographer?
He's chronicling my life.

01:33:03.083 --> 01:33:04.351
Toothpick?

01:33:08.355 --> 01:33:09.857
Are they flavored?

01:33:10.457 --> 01:33:11.325
Fuck's sake.

01:33:12.459 --> 01:33:13.327
Cinnamon.

01:33:14.094 --> 01:33:16.830
Nah, sorry, allergic.

01:34:09.483 --> 01:34:11.986
May I interest
either of you any refreshment?

01:34:12.319 --> 01:34:16.991
Yes, I would like a pip Winkelmann.
Heavy on the lemon, easy on the rocks.

01:34:17.024 --> 01:34:18.425
- Of course.
- Thank you.

01:34:18.459 --> 01:34:21.328
- And for you, sir?
- Uh, I do a Falkenhagen

01:34:21.362 --> 01:34:22.329
if you've got one.

01:34:22.363 --> 01:34:23.564
We certainly do.

01:34:35.576 --> 01:34:37.811
You're gonna tell me
what the fuck we're doing here?

01:35:04.305 --> 01:35:07.341
Gentlemen, thank you so much
for joining us.

01:35:07.875 --> 01:35:10.010
Why don't you grab
your beverages and follow me?

01:35:15.549 --> 01:35:17.518
I'm one of Mr. Vogel Vita's
attorneys,

01:35:17.551 --> 01:35:19.219
also his second cousin.

01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:21.889
Did You say, Vogel Vita?

01:35:22.122 --> 01:35:24.058
Any relation to Yan Vogel Vita?

01:35:24.091 --> 01:35:27.494
- The Austro-Bavarian propagandist filmmaker?
- Distant.

01:35:28.295 --> 01:35:29.196
But yes.

01:35:30.431 --> 01:35:32.866
Falkenhagen, it's one
of our beer brands.

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:34.401
Get out!

01:35:34.902 --> 01:35:37.371
Really? We love this stuff.

01:35:37.604 --> 01:35:40.074
Must take a lot of beer
to buy a place like this.

01:35:40.107 --> 01:35:42.509
Aside from the brewery
and import businesses,

01:35:42.543 --> 01:35:45.379
Anselm has interests in a wide
range of corporate concerns.

01:35:45.412 --> 01:35:48.415
The financial sector,
software and technology.

01:35:48.683 --> 01:35:50.117
Ah, speaking of which.

01:35:50.584 --> 01:35:53.387
- Hello, Andre.
- Hello, Charles.

01:35:56.123 --> 01:35:57.191
Follow me.

01:36:23.584 --> 01:36:24.518
Oh.

01:36:46.608 --> 01:36:49.644
My little nephew. Louis.

01:36:51.713 --> 01:36:53.580
Anselm, your guests,

01:36:54.548 --> 01:36:57.685
Floyd and his biographer.

01:36:57.719 --> 01:36:59.052
Uh, Samuel.

01:36:59.486 --> 01:37:01.989
Your nephew is incredible.

01:37:02.022 --> 01:37:05.325
- I'm a huge Beethoven fan and that...
- Same here, a big fan.

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:09.163
Terrific fan of Beethoven. Your
nephew, very talented musician.

01:37:09.396 --> 01:37:13.367
And, uh, it was a nice touch with the
wig and the little knickers, I dig it.

01:37:16.437 --> 01:37:17.337
Floyd.

01:37:21.308 --> 01:37:23.243
I've been looking for you.

01:37:24.311 --> 01:37:25.647
Oh, thank you.

01:37:29.516 --> 01:37:32.453
Chin, please. The dossier.

01:37:36.223 --> 01:37:40.360
Fred X. Dennis.
A.k.a Frederick Dobson.

01:37:40.394 --> 01:37:42.429
A.k.a Freddie Pendergrass.

01:37:42.463 --> 01:37:43.997
A.k.a Rick Stops.

01:37:44.264 --> 01:37:47.702
Born Florence
Miguelito Devereaux Gutierrez.

01:37:47.735 --> 01:37:49.503
Presently Floyd.

01:37:50.170 --> 01:37:53.006
After dropping out of high school,
spent several fruitless years

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.777
wandering the west Coast
as an aspiring jazz vocalist,

01:37:55.810 --> 01:37:58.312
but developed into
a small time con artist,

01:37:58.345 --> 01:38:03.217
- penitentiary marijuana dealer, and occasional gigolo instead.
- Naughty boy.

01:38:03.250 --> 01:38:05.552
Over a dozen misdemeanor
arrests that we found,

01:38:05.586 --> 01:38:07.321
and two expunge felonies.

01:38:07.354 --> 01:38:10.157
Currently under investigation
for insurance fraud,

01:38:10.190 --> 01:38:12.092
suspected of forgery
and counterfeiting,

01:38:12.125 --> 01:38:14.495
arson and public intoxication.

01:38:15.295 --> 01:38:18.532
Previously employed locally by
Febreze auto as a used car salesman.

01:38:18.565 --> 01:38:21.769
Hey, hey! I've never sold used.

01:38:27.541 --> 01:38:29.376
Until he was fired.

01:38:30.912 --> 01:38:35.349
And presently working flex time as a
security guard at Grand Bath Martlin.

01:38:37.484 --> 01:38:38.552
Is that...

01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:42.055
...more or less
the synopsis of your...

01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:44.759
...biography?

01:38:45.392 --> 01:38:49.196
No, no, it's not,
not at fucking all.

01:38:49.697 --> 01:38:51.031
Can I get another drink?

01:39:19.861 --> 01:39:25.566
Do you know
why we brought you here today?

01:39:44.719 --> 01:39:47.087
You've stolen from me.

01:39:47.722 --> 01:39:49.256
I steal from you, pal?

01:39:52.794 --> 01:39:55.395
You see, Floyd.

01:39:56.631 --> 01:40:00.567
Much like you, I quite enjoy
gambling on athletics.

01:40:01.501 --> 01:40:05.105
In particular high school hoops.

01:40:07.609 --> 01:40:14.581
But when I recently lost a significant
speculation on a near certain winner,

01:40:15.182 --> 01:40:20.120
I have decided to do
a little digging for myself.

01:40:23.523 --> 01:40:27.862
You paid Lentil Washington,

01:40:27.895 --> 01:40:31.131
a.k.a Beans...

01:40:32.232 --> 01:40:33.735
...to throw that game

01:40:34.769 --> 01:40:37.705
in order to guarantee
a win for yourself.

01:40:37.739 --> 01:40:41.174
A piddling $11,000.

01:40:42.844 --> 01:40:45.145
And your little transgression...

01:40:46.648 --> 01:40:49.784
...caused me to lose.
And I know this all for certain.

01:40:49.817 --> 01:40:51.619
And you know I know this
for certain, don't you?

01:40:54.789 --> 01:40:59.861
I could've went fink on you,
I could've told your bookie...

01:41:01.796 --> 01:41:04.264
...but you'd be dead already,
and that does nothing for me.

01:41:04.297 --> 01:41:05.800
So, this is what we shall do.

01:41:06.968 --> 01:41:11.471
There is a particular politician from
the Congo coming to town in a few weeks.

01:41:11.906 --> 01:41:14.541
He's been giving me a bit of
trouble in his part of the world.

01:41:14.942 --> 01:41:18.980
I will not tire you with the
tedium as it is entirely material.

01:41:19.013 --> 01:41:21.314
But, essentially...

01:41:22.684 --> 01:41:27.421
...I shall need you
to extinguish him.

01:41:29.657 --> 01:41:32.827
Extinguish? As in kill?

01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:34.494
Mm-hmm.

01:41:36.130 --> 01:41:39.599
Sorry, pal. I've done a lot of things
in my life, murderer isn't one of them.

01:41:43.738 --> 01:41:44.639
Okay.

01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:47.942
Then you shall pay me
what you owe me,

01:41:47.975 --> 01:41:50.544
plus interest within seven days.

01:41:51.846 --> 01:41:55.883
Or I shall extinguish you.

01:41:57.785 --> 01:41:58.820
How much would that be?

01:42:00.655 --> 01:42:06.994
- $919,756.66.
- That's bullshit.

01:42:07.895 --> 01:42:09.697
How am I supposed
to get that in a week?

01:42:11.331 --> 01:42:15.703
I don't care, rob a bank.

01:42:41.595 --> 01:42:43.530
He was a dreadful attorney.

01:42:44.564 --> 01:42:46.566
But that fact aside...

01:42:47.434 --> 01:42:48.870
...if I will do that to him,

01:42:49.670 --> 01:42:50.705
my own cousin...

01:42:52.807 --> 01:42:58.679
...please know, I will do
the same to you with pleasure.

01:42:59.747 --> 01:43:01.314
Thank you for listening.
Bye-bye.

01:43:07.722 --> 01:43:10.057
Okay. Hold on a sec.
Hold on a sec.

01:43:12.894 --> 01:43:13.828
Bye-bye!

01:43:17.865 --> 01:43:21.601
Oh, and please make sure
Charles is not breathing

01:43:21.636 --> 01:43:23.738
before you dump him. Thank you.

01:43:25.039 --> 01:43:26.406
Okay. Where were we?

01:43:27.507 --> 01:43:30.044
You are going to dance for me.

01:43:33.815 --> 01:43:35.850
Okay, guys,
we'll see you next week.

01:43:37.618 --> 01:43:39.053
These guys are not that bad.

01:43:39.086 --> 01:43:41.454
I always say, you gotta
kill them with kindness,

01:43:41.488 --> 01:43:43.590
and they will kill you...

01:43:46.861 --> 01:43:49.096
You fucking liar!

01:44:01.642 --> 01:44:04.879
Fucking shit. Piece of shit.

01:44:04.912 --> 01:44:08.582
When the smoke clears, everybody's
lying about something. Everybody.

01:44:08.616 --> 01:44:10.651
You're a sociopath.

01:44:10.685 --> 01:44:12.119
Yeah. Well, I'm not the one
hearing voices.

01:44:12.153 --> 01:44:14.689
I said sociopath,
not schizophrenic!

01:44:14.722 --> 01:44:16.958
Whatever. They're both tomatoes.

01:44:17.892 --> 01:44:20.962
- Listen, I'm sorry. I was going to come clean.
- Fuck you, man.

01:44:21.428 --> 01:44:22.797
I will put this shit
in the book.

01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:23.865
- All of it.
- Do I care?

01:44:23.898 --> 01:44:26.133
Do I care? No, I don't care.

01:44:26.167 --> 01:44:28.703
- Write whatever you want.
- Oh, I will, asshole.

01:44:28.736 --> 01:44:30.071
- Fine, asshole.
- Asshole?

01:44:30.104 --> 01:44:31.571
You're the asshole!

01:44:34.441 --> 01:44:35.142
Yeah.

01:44:37.144 --> 01:44:39.714
Wipe your fucking nose.

01:44:46.053 --> 01:44:46.954
Why?

01:44:58.666 --> 01:45:00.735
<i>He knew that I
wouldn't trust him anymore.</i>

01:45:01.068 --> 01:45:03.436
<i>That a simple apology
wouldn't suffice.</i>

01:45:04.504 --> 01:45:07.507
<i>So he answered my questions,
filled in the gaps</i>

01:45:07.775 --> 01:45:09.944
<i>and asked only
that I withhold judgment</i>

01:45:10.244 --> 01:45:11.779
<i>just as he would for me.</i>

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:18.451
<i>He told me he needed me
as a friend and he meant it.</i>

01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:21.088
- Oh...
- Game!

01:45:27.895 --> 01:45:28.996
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:45:34.835 --> 01:45:35.736
So...

01:45:36.904 --> 01:45:39.941
...what are you gonna do?
Can you mortgage the house?

01:45:39.974 --> 01:45:41.876
No, the house isn't mine.
It belongs to Jackie.

01:45:42.643 --> 01:45:43.744
She has all the cash.

01:45:45.146 --> 01:45:46.981
Can you ask her for...

01:45:48.716 --> 01:45:50.785
Right.

01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:55.555
I made my bed but I got a plan.

01:45:55.588 --> 01:45:58.859
I'm going to do what that what's
his name said, I'm gonna rob a bank.

01:45:59.526 --> 01:46:00.560
No, you're not.

01:46:00.593 --> 01:46:01.494
Yeah.

01:46:02.897 --> 01:46:05.967
It's an old chestnut, I know,
but that's why it's going to work.

01:46:06.533 --> 01:46:07.735
Have a good feeling about it.

01:46:08.302 --> 01:46:09.804
Besides, where am I going to get

01:46:10.671 --> 01:46:12.572
close to a million dollars
in less than a week?

01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:16.143
Bank I guess.

01:46:17.244 --> 01:46:18.946
Do you have a gun from work?

01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:22.482
No, we use bear spray
and sticks.

01:46:23.884 --> 01:46:24.819
But...

01:46:28.222 --> 01:46:30.891
- You're gonna rob a bank with that?
- Mm-hmm.

01:46:32.093 --> 01:46:36.197
It doesn't work. Sitting on the bottom
of a retention pond for over a year.

01:46:36.230 --> 01:46:37.898
I don't even have bullets
for it, but...

01:46:38.766 --> 01:46:40.801
...we're gonna have to pull
something in there.

01:46:42.602 --> 01:46:44.138
Not worried about it.
We'll be fine.

01:46:44.872 --> 01:46:46.207
We? What?

01:46:46.774 --> 01:46:47.842
Are you kidding me?

01:46:47.875 --> 01:46:49.310
- No.
- No, no, no.

01:46:49.343 --> 01:46:52.313
I am not robbing
a fucking bank, Floyd!

01:46:52.346 --> 01:46:54.782
- No, no way.
- Of course you're not robbing the bank.

01:46:54.815 --> 01:46:56.183
I would never put you
in harm's way.

01:46:57.051 --> 01:46:58.786
- It's why you're driving.
- Floyd.

01:47:00.788 --> 01:47:01.689
No.

01:47:02.923 --> 01:47:04.125
This is your thing.

01:47:08.262 --> 01:47:09.897
Well, I figured you'd say that.

01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:14.101
Suppose I could
drum up somebody else.

01:47:27.248 --> 01:47:29.050
Better lay off that flask,
my friend.

01:47:31.018 --> 01:47:34.088
I'm nervous, I'm about to
rob a damn bank, Floyd.

01:47:34.789 --> 01:47:37.725
I'm robbing the bank, you're driving.
You shouldn't be drinking.

01:47:41.062 --> 01:47:41.962
Let me have that.

01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:47.001
Hmm.

01:47:51.939 --> 01:47:53.174
You got your lipstick on it.

01:47:55.943 --> 01:47:58.112
What are you doing?
Putting lipstick on

01:47:58.145 --> 01:47:59.780
if you're just gonna wear
a damn mask.

01:48:00.948 --> 01:48:02.149
Helps me get into character.

01:48:06.787 --> 01:48:07.855
Oh.

01:48:08.289 --> 01:48:10.057
There's no way
that thing's gonna work.

01:48:11.192 --> 01:48:13.194
You're right, it doesn't.

01:48:14.929 --> 01:48:16.664
- Oh, shit.
- Where'd it go?

01:48:17.398 --> 01:48:18.332
Shit.

01:48:21.102 --> 01:48:22.369
- Is that blood?
- A little bit.

01:48:22.403 --> 01:48:23.838
- Am I bleeding?
- A little bit.

01:48:25.573 --> 01:48:28.843
- Floyd, why am I bleeding?
- Just put a little pressure on that right now and... Here.

01:48:28.876 --> 01:48:30.911
Keep drinking, all right?
Just keep drinking.

01:48:31.178 --> 01:48:32.213
Oh, shit.

01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:34.448
Fuck. And, uh, let me
get organized here.

01:48:34.482 --> 01:48:37.751
I'm just gonna take care of business.
I'm gonna go in and out.

01:48:37.785 --> 01:48:40.855
Five minutes. It will take five minutes.
Here, hold that mirror up.

01:48:40.888 --> 01:48:41.956
I'll be right back.

01:48:42.456 --> 01:48:44.191
Oh, fuck. Where's the mirror?

01:48:44.225 --> 01:48:45.893
Hold it up.
I can't see, goddamn it.

01:48:46.861 --> 01:48:47.761
Stop shaking.

01:48:49.130 --> 01:48:51.165
I can't...
I can't see a goddamn thing.

01:48:51.198 --> 01:48:52.366
Oh, shit. That looks terrible.

01:48:53.267 --> 01:48:55.836
Oh, shit. Hold it up!
Hold it up!

01:48:56.203 --> 01:48:58.372
Fuck.

01:48:59.807 --> 01:49:03.144
Okay, all right. Just give me five minutes.
I'll be right back.

01:49:03.177 --> 01:49:04.345
We'll get you stitched up.

01:49:05.312 --> 01:49:06.213
Where's my purse?

01:49:10.084 --> 01:49:11.852
Hurry up, Floyd.

01:49:18.325 --> 01:49:19.226
He shot me.

01:49:22.296 --> 01:49:24.965
F...

01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:33.874
Oh, shit.

01:49:36.477 --> 01:49:38.312
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:49:38.979 --> 01:49:41.182
Go, go, go, go!

01:49:41.215 --> 01:49:42.983
Go, go, go, go!

01:49:43.017 --> 01:49:44.785
Straighten out, straighten out!
Where are you going?

01:49:44.818 --> 01:49:48.255
Where are you going?
Straighten out! Straighten out!

01:49:48.289 --> 01:49:50.157
Come on, come on. Oh, shit!

01:49:56.497 --> 01:49:57.765
You're kidding me.

01:50:04.104 --> 01:50:06.974
<i>As Roy slowly
tiptoed to the other side,</i>

01:50:07.007 --> 01:50:09.910
<i>Floyd's fortune
or lack thereof found him unable</i>

01:50:09.944 --> 01:50:12.179
<i>to successfully evade
the police after his heist.</i>

01:50:12.479 --> 01:50:17.184
<i>Dispatched immediately in seeking a
transvestite suspect in white evening gloves,</i>

01:50:17.218 --> 01:50:20.254
<i>they found their man just 100
yards from the bank's entrance.</i>

01:50:21.121 --> 01:50:22.022
Are you sure?

01:50:23.290 --> 01:50:24.858
All right, losers weepers.

01:50:27.294 --> 01:50:30.097
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:50:30.130 --> 01:50:32.199
<i>Luckily,
he would avoid yet another arrest</i>

01:50:32.433 --> 01:50:34.969
<i>because these cops on this day...</i>

01:50:35.002 --> 01:50:37.438
<i>...just couldn't bear the thought of all that paperwork.</i>

01:51:29.890 --> 01:51:31.925
<i>Do they know you
don't have the money?</i>

01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:36.130
<i>Did you tell them you got robbed
by the cops, or...</i>

01:51:37.298 --> 01:51:38.999
<i>...did you ask for more time?</i>

01:51:41.902 --> 01:51:42.803
<i>Time's up.</i>

01:51:49.611 --> 01:51:51.111
What are you gonna do?

01:51:57.151 --> 01:51:58.052
You're smoking?

01:51:58.352 --> 01:52:00.487
I bumped it from Eddie.

01:52:09.530 --> 01:52:12.066
You know, about a month ago,
Kimmi asked me

01:52:12.099 --> 01:52:14.535
to move with her to Colorado
where her sister lives.

01:52:16.303 --> 01:52:17.871
Kimmi loves the mountains.

01:52:23.911 --> 01:52:25.079
Should've said yes.

01:52:28.382 --> 01:52:29.483
What about your family?

01:52:31.452 --> 01:52:33.087
Eddie's at that age..

01:52:35.122 --> 01:52:36.390
Well, he can't stand me.

01:52:37.191 --> 01:52:39.326
And, uh, Jackie.

01:52:47.534 --> 01:52:48.602
Lily might care.

01:52:50.070 --> 01:52:51.305
She knows how much I love her.

01:53:16.130 --> 01:53:18.098
Where did you find this?

01:53:18.132 --> 01:53:20.100
I found it in the street
by the mailbox.

01:53:20.635 --> 01:53:22.436
How did...

01:53:25.372 --> 01:53:27.675
I want you to have it.

01:53:39.086 --> 01:53:39.987
Floyd.

01:53:42.222 --> 01:53:43.924
There's something
I have to tell you.

01:53:46.661 --> 01:53:47.561
I don't...

01:53:50.464 --> 01:53:52.299
I don't really remember, but...

01:53:53.768 --> 01:53:54.669
...I think...

01:53:56.103 --> 01:53:57.371
...I think...

01:54:02.309 --> 01:54:04.044
The night you hit me...

01:54:07.147 --> 01:54:08.182
...it wasn't your fault.

01:54:13.487 --> 01:54:14.955
I wanted you to hit me.

01:54:27.702 --> 01:54:31.038
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm lucky you did.

01:54:32.139 --> 01:54:33.574
You're the closest...

01:54:41.081 --> 01:54:41.982
You saved me.

01:55:30.597 --> 01:55:31.633
Hey, pal. How you doing?

01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:36.136
- Let me go upstairs, grab your cash, I'll be right back.
- Certainly.

01:55:39.339 --> 01:55:40.374
But please be cognizant.

01:55:41.609 --> 01:55:44.144
You're not back down here in
90 seconds with what's expected,

01:55:44.646 --> 01:55:47.347
you're gonna make things very
difficult for me and for yourself.

01:55:51.251 --> 01:55:52.152
Okay.

01:56:09.737 --> 01:56:10.838
What?

01:56:14.341 --> 01:56:15.610
You know I love you, right?

01:56:38.532 --> 01:56:39.433
Hey.

01:56:44.806 --> 01:56:46.774
- What are you doing?
- I'm just reading.

01:59:05.579 --> 01:59:07.314
He's gone. In the woods.

01:59:54.929 --> 01:59:55.963
Floyd!

01:59:58.598 --> 01:59:59.767
Wait!

02:00:21.923 --> 02:00:24.457
No! Please don't kill him!

02:00:29.462 --> 02:00:30.564
Six. Five.

02:00:34.836 --> 02:00:35.770
Two.

02:00:36.103 --> 02:00:37.004
One.

02:00:37.805 --> 02:00:38.806
Zero.

02:01:50.011 --> 02:01:50.912
The bush!

02:03:20.201 --> 02:03:21.102
I miss him.

02:03:24.238 --> 02:03:25.538
I'm sorry, I'm...

02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:29.710
Where were we?

02:03:31.112 --> 02:03:32.013
The epilogue.

02:03:40.621 --> 02:03:43.090
I <i>was in the hospital
during Floyd's funeral.</i>

02:03:44.125 --> 02:03:47.527
<i>Wouldn't have been able
to go anyway. Not then.</i>

02:03:51.032 --> 02:03:53.067
<i>They didn't even have
anything to bury.</i>

02:03:54.702 --> 02:03:59.173
<i>They just put a few of his
favorite things into a casket.</i>

02:04:05.913 --> 02:04:07.748
<i>The meteor hit that same night.</i>

02:04:11.752 --> 02:04:13.054
<i>It was in my dream.</i>

02:04:14.288 --> 02:04:15.856
<i>I told Floyd about it
and he knew it meant something.</i>

02:04:16.090 --> 02:04:17.590
<i>Just didn't know what.</i>

02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.561
This, mm...

02:04:23.731 --> 02:04:24.632
Delicious.

02:04:34.942 --> 02:04:35.843
Oh.

02:05:07.241 --> 02:05:10.678
<i>Jacqueline called me out of the
blue, she wanted to meet.</i>

02:05:13.147 --> 02:05:15.950
<i>She sold the house,
moved to the city with Edward,</i>

02:05:15.983 --> 02:05:18.219
<i>bought a block from Floyd's
favorite old diner.</i>

02:05:19.286 --> 02:05:21.722
<i>She had just gotten engaged
to an architect,</i>

02:05:21.755 --> 02:05:24.325
<i>little younger I guess,
said Edward really liked him.</i>

02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:28.362
<i>She told me her sister
had been in Las Vegas</i>

02:05:29.230 --> 02:05:30.831
<i>and swore she saw Floyd.</i>

02:05:31.899 --> 02:05:35.970
<i>She said if he was alive,
if he ever</i>

02:05:36.704 --> 02:05:38.072
<i>reached out to me...</i>

02:05:39.874 --> 02:05:42.743
<i>...she'd just want him to know that
they were doing fine, they were happy,</i>

02:05:43.110 --> 02:05:46.213
<i>and she hoped he finally
found happiness wherever he was.</i>

02:05:50.751 --> 02:05:54.021
<i>Not long after that,
I was in Denver for a signing.</i>

02:06:12.806 --> 02:06:13.707
It's unbelievable.

02:06:24.818 --> 02:06:25.753
<i>It was like...</i>

02:06:26.220 --> 02:06:27.188
It was him.

02:06:28.322 --> 02:06:29.857
<i>...I'd seen a ghost.</i>

02:06:36.830 --> 02:06:37.731
Astonishing.

02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:40.801
Truly.

02:06:44.371 --> 02:06:45.272
What about Lily?

02:06:54.048 --> 02:06:54.949
Thank you.

02:07:03.057 --> 02:07:05.192
<i>Lily moved away
soon after the funeral.</i>

02:07:06.227 --> 02:07:09.296
<i>She came to visit me
in the hospital before she left.</i>

02:07:10.898 --> 02:07:12.933
<i>I hadn't seen her
since then but...</i>

02:07:14.268 --> 02:07:16.270
<i>...I thought about her
every single day.</i>
