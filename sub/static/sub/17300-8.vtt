WEBVTT

00:03.205 --> 00:04.799
In tonight's episode:

00:05.174 --> 00:08.295
Knight in our reasonably priced car.

00:08.829 --> 00:12.350
Maserati's new coupe is it in for our track.

00:13.781 --> 00:17.141
I close the door mirrors. We went in search

00:17.176 --> 00:19.928
the fastest driver of white vans in Britain.

00:25.116 --> 00:28.853
But first, followed by an apology.
In last week's show,

00:28.888 --> 00:33.191
mainly we deal with the
environment and I think I blew it.

00:33.226 --> 00:34.785
As we neared the end,

00:34.820 --> 00:37.814
inadvertently I said I unto
death to išutiram domestic owl.

00:37.849 --> 00:40.567
You said you were going to išutirati to death for fun.
-I know.

00:40.602 --> 00:43.286
Is it now that we can clarify? Even if you walk

00:43.321 --> 00:46.440
after the branch of a tree and
an owl you get in their way,

00:46.475 --> 00:49.559
Do not kicking it.
-I Just do not.

00:49.974 --> 00:53.452
We failed ourselves, but we failed and owls.

00:53.487 --> 00:57.230
This was our attempt to be green,
we screwed up thing

00:57.265 --> 01:00.973
we will no longer be green,
this week we will be scarlet.

01:04.294 --> 01:09.315
And that is why we are in
the studio of the new BMW M5.

01:09.350 --> 01:14.193
Four-door sedan and 400 hp under the hood.

01:14.568 --> 01:17.598
Many of you have no idea about what is KS 400,

01:17.633 --> 01:21.649
so I made this run chart that I explained to you.

01:21.898 --> 01:27.827
Here, this is the power, and this is in order
to simplify, the number of double-decker bus.

01:28.818 --> 01:36.342
For example, Nelson's Monument, 10 double-deckers.
Big Ben on 30 June.

01:36.377 --> 01:40.343
And here we have a 400 horsepower, about here,

01:40.378 --> 01:46.579
40 double-deckers.
If you could spread out 400 hp per country,

01:46.614 --> 01:52.704
thickness of 15 cm,
to cover an area of ​​Belgium.

01:54.192 --> 01:59.925
A BMW is not the only manufacturer that
puts so much of Belgium under the hood.

01:59.960 --> 02:04.930
Look at this. This is a Jaguar S Type R, now with

02:04.965 --> 02:09.866
turbocharged V8 engine of 4.2 liters and 400 hp.

02:09.901 --> 02:13.203
Auto is divine,
and Jaguar are certainly very satisfied

02:13.436 --> 02:17.540
because finally,
after all these years caught up with BMW.

02:18.021 --> 02:22.454
But now joined by Audi and raised the bar.

02:27.585 --> 02:31.902
In fact, they took an ordinary,
rather antiseptic body

02:31.937 --> 02:37.284
A6 model and equipped the V8 engine
of 2.4 l with a double turbo-powered

02:37.571 --> 02:43.691
that achieves a whopping 450 hp.

02:49.139 --> 02:52.623
This is the same size as Portugal.

02:53.031 --> 02:56.043
You could equip the Cathedral
of St. Paul seven times

02:56.356 --> 03:00.743
power output of 450 hp. Seven times.

03:02.434 --> 03:08.026
Therefore, it is much stronger than the M5 which
is also noticeable in addition to all of the wires

03:08.061 --> 03:13.619
and bright pier.
You know immediately that this thing serious.

03:14.558 --> 03:21.348
0-100 km / h developed for ...
I do not know, 0 seconds. Top speed is limited

03:21.383 --> 03:25.622
at 250 km / h to happiness
to the German Green Party,

03:25.657 --> 03:29.507
but the other day I was driving on the test track

03:29.542 --> 03:33.323
and video that was 280 km / h on the meter.

03:33.358 --> 03:36.197
I appreciate to be able to
develop up to 360 km / h

03:36.232 --> 03:38.332
If you have a long enough track.

03:40.397 --> 03:45.056
God, it's fast. Such forces.

03:48.677 --> 03:55.055
RS6 is sold as a sedan or estate,
both for about 58,000 pounds.

03:55.090 --> 03:58.720
That's 5,000 pounds more than the BMW M5,

03:58.755 --> 04:04.284
but I think this is one of
the best cars on the road.

04:12.592 --> 04:16.103
Many rock aristocrats ride this fast Audije.

04:16.137 --> 04:17.999
Kenny Jones, Mitch Mitchell ...

04:18.034 --> 04:21.158
They made their fortunes,
and will have a calm and moderate

04:21.192 --> 04:23.477
for the later years of life, but it is the same as

04:23.512 --> 04:25.873
and acoustic albums that record. I can not resist

04:25.908 --> 04:29.834
they have 42 lasers and inflatable pig.

04:30.582 --> 04:34.357
Yes, I will Audi.
I want to be a moderate, but look, and fenders,

04:34.392 --> 04:38.132
See the huge front grille.
I want to. Thick rubber.

04:39.225 --> 04:43.779
And this is a country rock star.
All rock aristocracy ends here

04:43.814 --> 04:48.989
14 when the album comes out
in a double-platinum release.

04:49.676 --> 04:52.598
This is for example the back yard Gordon Sting

04:52.633 --> 04:56.162
Wiltshire, or as you call it.
In addition to this work

04:56.197 --> 04:59.494
who borrowed accountant only he has not noticed.

05:02.745 --> 05:07.111
Everyone here is in a group, it makes a stop

05:07.146 --> 05:10.887
and inquiries for directions rare treat.

05:12.012 --> 05:16.191
Excuse me,
can you direct me to the home of Steve Winwood?

05:16.476 --> 05:21.260
Steve Winwood? Straight to Van Morrison House,

05:21.624 --> 05:26.489
Sting then left to the pond. Strolling along the

05:26.693 --> 05:30.318
and then at the intersection in front
of the house Peter Gabriel left turn.

05:30.353 --> 05:32.813
Great, thanks. From that you group?

05:32.848 --> 05:35.273
Pink Floyd. Oh, yeah, you're a drummer.

05:35.586 --> 05:38.354
Do you have Audi? Yes, a few.

05:38.389 --> 05:41.743
Do you own this model?
-Stiže For Christmas. -Thank you very much.

05:47.945 --> 05:51.744
I do not blame rock dinosaurs you choose Audi.

05:51.779 --> 05:55.925
It's not only well-designed
volcano out of control.

05:55.960 --> 05:59.442
Harnesses the power of Quattro
system with drive to all four wheels,

05:59.477 --> 06:02.403
a few are strengthened and the suspension.

06:03.552 --> 06:08.498
No, Jeremy, you're wrong. Not a little but a lot.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:19.467 --> 06:22.619
I could live with the hard ride,
which is a good job,

06:22.654 --> 06:26.339
because I could not live without
that looks and this strength.

06:26.374 --> 06:30.025
This car is a "stairway to heaven",
"Bohemian Rhapsody".

06:31.307 --> 06:35.458
But the Audi Unfortunately,
this is not the end of the story.

06:35.960 --> 06:41.023
Easily better than the BMW M5 and Jaguar S Type R.

06:41.058 --> 06:44.565
But in the Mercedes went wild.

06:49.771 --> 06:56.311
Welcome to E55. Welcome to the dawn of 500 hp.

06:59.446 --> 07:03.509
I'm not a fan of E-class style. Looks like Honda,

07:03.544 --> 07:07.285
I'm not even a fan of Mercedes' customer service.

07:10.703 --> 07:15.515
However,
I'm a big fan of this huge V8 turbocharged

07:15.550 --> 07:19.126
engine volume of 5.5 liters.
The same engine is placed in SL,

07:19.161 --> 07:26.367
sounds like a Tornado fighter jet and NASCAR,
with a hint of thunder.

07:27.053 --> 07:32.434
I have to admit that it was quite silenced,
but the strength is still there.

07:32.948 --> 07:39.531
If you do not mind spending a liter of petrol
to 2.5 km, this miracle is absolutely flying.

07:45.883 --> 07:49.816
Yes, it cost 3,000 pounds more than the Audi,
but you get more.

07:49.851 --> 07:52.915
On a flat road is even faster.

07:53.547 --> 07:59.583
One caveat.
This car reminds me somewhat on Eurofighter

07:59.618 --> 08:03.009
who can not fly without the integrated computer

08:03.044 --> 08:05.564
who constantly adjust course.

08:05.599 --> 08:08.078
And this is the same.
Do not forget that there is no AWD.

08:08.349 --> 08:11.720
I do not think you can drive it in this weather

08:12.564 --> 08:15.981
rain and wet leaves without traction control.

08:16.942 --> 08:20.604
Constant love and you can feel how it works.

08:24.306 --> 08:27.273
Even the slightest hint of gas,

08:28.122 --> 08:34.768
will turn on a light that tells me
that the machine just saved belaja.

08:38.886 --> 08:45.844
You are right on the edge.
500 hp. Beyond that, you can not.

08:54.517 --> 08:57.995
So, this car or Audi?

08:58.612 --> 09:02.279
The same level of quality,
the same size, the interior ambience.

09:05.111 --> 09:08.445
The choice is not difficult. Look at it this way.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.345
If Audi Kit Mun, wild and riotous,

09:12.380 --> 09:16.210
then Mercedes Charlie Watts. Quiet and unassuming.

09:16.901 --> 09:22.520
Yeah? I've always been a fan of The Who.
That's why I choose Audi.

09:24.981 --> 09:28.163
Is that really a drummer from Pink Floyd?
Yeah, Nick Mason.

09:28.198 --> 09:31.373
He went over to borrow a cup
of sugar from Roger Doltrija.

09:31.408 --> 09:34.132
So Mercedes is the most powerful?
-Yes.

09:34.167 --> 09:37.182
And which car was the fastest on the track?
-On The track, in the dry,

09:37.217 --> 09:40.102
I'm pretty convinced that it was a Mercedes,

09:40.305 --> 09:44.077
But of course,
the inevitable rain falling when we gave Stig,

09:44.112 --> 09:47.849
Audi is powered by 4 point was 2.5 seconds faster.
Really?

09:48.236 --> 09:51.507
Da 1:33. Same as the SL and the NSX.

09:51.542 --> 09:55.652
This is very, very fast car.
Just quick. All the time.

09:55.687 --> 10:00.899
However, it is the second.
This Mercedes trip with strength

10:00.934 --> 10:03.519
where the Germans are now engaged,
BMW with 400 hp,

10:03.554 --> 10:07.490
However, Audi with 450 hp and 476
hp with Mercedes, we have this chart

10:07.525 --> 10:12.306
Let's see where it leads.
Now we are in 2002 with 400 hp.

10:12.341 --> 10:16.237
If you continue to follow the rise,
by 2008 we will have

10:16.272 --> 10:19.652
the strength of a thousand million hp.

10:20.184 --> 10:23.881
And that is the distance
between Earth and the moon.

10:24.128 --> 10:27.666
Okay. Tonight's show is dedicated to driving cars.

10:27.701 --> 10:30.649
What compels us to contemplate
whether it is possible

10:30.684 --> 10:33.563
that from something, anything,
compile the driver's car.

10:33.598 --> 10:38.400
To do this,
we found a guy who has Ladu and we stole it.

10:41.476 --> 10:44.846
This is the base of Lotus in Hedel, Norfolk.

10:45.069 --> 10:49.289
And this is 1.5 E Lada Pola Sherwood.

10:49.496 --> 10:52.630
She is six years and is worth 200 pounds.

10:59.147 --> 11:01.938
Silly mission took Kris Arnold,

11:01.973 --> 11:05.251
General Manager Lotus Sport & Performance.

11:05.886 --> 11:07.965
So that's it?
-Yes. It's a project car?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.347
Oh my God. I do not understand much in Lade.

11:10.382 --> 11:12.936
How long did you have? Something less than a year.

11:12.971 --> 11:15.999
Lada gets into your blood,
and when you enter you can not get rid of.

11:16.034 --> 11:17.817
It's a good car.

11:17.852 --> 11:20.317
I meant to talk about aerodynamics,
but I'm not sure

11:20.352 --> 11:22.661
what can we do. It is rather boxy.

11:24.611 --> 11:27.075
This eclipse, to the interior Lade.

11:27.110 --> 11:29.181
It's pretty dark in there.
-Yes.

11:29.216 --> 11:33.138
And that old steering wheel
is not exactly fashionable.

11:33.173 --> 11:36.512
You can insult it, you can target the bricks,

11:36.547 --> 11:40.036
but it is only one firm, uncouth car.

11:41.448 --> 11:44.483
Here's your Lada 1500 engine Vulgaris.
-Yes.

11:44.518 --> 11:47.484
It is basically a Russian tractor engine.

11:47.519 --> 11:50.255
To be honest,
I do not think it pays to do something with this.

11:50.290 --> 11:54.618
I'd say all of this to pluck up,
and I put a new motor in there.

11:54.653 --> 11:59.594
The desire to always help,
we spent 200 pounds and bought him a new engine.

11:59.841 --> 12:04.067
A little worried that she do something bad.
Really.

12:10.921 --> 12:13.824
Oh my God. What's he doing?

12:14.884 --> 12:17.309
In order to assess the
conditions of the upcoming task

12:17.344 --> 12:19.766
related to the ride and handling,
Lotus has released its

12:19.801 --> 12:21.824
best man, Gavin Kershaw.

12:37.907 --> 12:41.789
This is definitely the worst car I've ever driven.

12:46.801 --> 12:49.478
It's not every day that Russell Kar

12:49.513 --> 12:52.155
and his team of designers get their hands Lade.

12:52.526 --> 12:55.139
If we find good wheels at the right size

12:55.174 --> 12:57.752
and if we determine a good height
to give him a stronger stance.

12:57.787 --> 13:00.197
And to correct the attitude
of the wheels and the body.

13:00.965 --> 13:04.595
This piece carbon fiber worth £
500 more expensive than the car.

13:05.230 --> 13:08.252
Questions were raised about the color,
or black will cover

13:08.287 --> 13:11.730
better disguised some details that we put,

13:11.765 --> 13:15.173
but it will cleanse the surface.
It'll be just fine.

13:15.582 --> 13:18.497
They should just shake loose
grate and see what it does.

13:19.265 --> 13:21.933
We could mix these two colors.

13:22.225 --> 13:24.994
To get out of the center console,
perhaps to remove it

13:25.029 --> 13:27.764
and this partition,
to put under the aluminum carrier,

13:27.799 --> 13:29.164
to clean up there.

13:29.199 --> 13:31.610
Perhaps to add some detail in silver

13:31.645 --> 13:33.986
to obtain a sporty feel, more like this.

13:34.021 --> 13:37.344
The owner was worried that
you will spoil the look.

13:41.371 --> 13:43.822
I hope it will not prove that he was right.

13:43.857 --> 13:46.273
It will be hard work, but if anyone can do it,

13:46.308 --> 13:48.878
it's those brave guys from Lotus.

13:48.913 --> 13:51.413
Can fix Voksal to work on Proton.

13:51.448 --> 13:55.756
Later we will look at how they fared with Lado,
but first let's go to the news.

13:56.335 --> 13:59.806
Absolutely.
Let's start with a story about parking.

13:59.841 --> 14:04.042
Rio Ferdinand,
who came to him as a football player ...

14:04.588 --> 14:07.818
For which team plays? Manchester United.

14:07.853 --> 14:10.196
So that was able to afford
an Aston Martin Venkviš,

14:10.231 --> 14:12.505
but should you can afford a fine of 40 pounds

14:12.540 --> 14:17.204
he received because he was not parked
in a box that was not wide enough.

14:17.425 --> 14:20.699
Should not that boxing is wide
enough to accommodate a car?

14:20.734 --> 14:22.303
That would make sense. He had been lucky.

14:22.338 --> 14:24.129
I am a few days ago received a sentence,
I'm not kidding you,

14:24.164 --> 14:28.484
because I badly parked.
When it became like ice skating?

14:28.519 --> 14:32.805
Where will all stand and evaluate:
"I would not say that is a nice park."

14:32.840 --> 14:35.628
"I just three points from
the judges from Nigeria."

14:36.993 --> 14:38.994
A has a negative effect. If it will work,

14:39.029 --> 14:41.625
then you have to work on the principle
of carrot and stick, and to do

14:41.660 --> 14:44.186
something positive,
especially if they think you're a nice park.

14:44.221 --> 14:46.602
I ought to praise or to make glue
"bee" on the windshield.

14:46.637 --> 14:50.726
Or a booklet with coupons.
-When Speaking of parking,

14:50.761 --> 14:54.816
know where we compile this program,
in the center of London.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.678
Across the road is a multi-storey
garage where for two hours

14:57.713 --> 15:01.532
paid 9 pounds.
If you stay 2 hours, 15 minutes, 18 pounds.

15:02.295 --> 15:04.672
Last weekend I went to Oxford, I parked

15:04.707 --> 15:08.011
the illegal site, exactly where I fit,

15:08.558 --> 15:12.046
I took the kids to lunch,
we went to watch James Bond,

15:12.081 --> 15:15.535
we returned 5 hours later,
I received a sentence of 20 pounds.

15:16.217 --> 15:17.503
It is quite reasonable.

15:18.503 --> 15:21.080
Admit that you invented valet parking. I did.

15:21.115 --> 15:25.955
I lived in Fulham next to parking services,

15:25.990 --> 15:29.473
so I was able to drive to the West End,
drink a few drinks,

15:29.508 --> 15:31.981
leave the car,
to be staggered home as best they can,

15:32.016 --> 15:34.840
and when I woke up in the morning,
they would have it towed home.

15:36.197 --> 15:39.003
It was a little expensive but it was worth it.

15:40.206 --> 15:42.949
Well, news from Citroën. Berlingo Multispas.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.900
We saw it at the very beginning of the series,
and we all agreed

15:45.935 --> 15:48.817
it is a fantastic car.
Great family car, a great ride

15:48.852 --> 15:51.294
and everything else, and best of all it is cheap.

15:51.329 --> 15:56.275
This is new, it is not completely new,
it was a little upeglali, but it looks nicer.

15:56.661 --> 16:02.670
A more important is that it is still beautiful.
- "Nicer" is a relative term.

16:03.092 --> 16:07.892
As if they use a hammer to hit En Vidék.
-She Would be nicer.

16:12.296 --> 16:14.739
But most importantly, if we neglect appearance,

16:14.774 --> 16:17.594
is that you get the whole package
of cheap and because we still

16:17.629 --> 16:20.569
doing the same arrangement with the
refund until the end of the year

16:20.604 --> 16:23.509
which means that costs about 8,000. A big car for 8000.
-I know.

16:24.243 --> 16:28.608
Here we are. Astra. We all waited. Come on now.

16:28.643 --> 16:31.573
The hot Astra, 200 hp.

16:31.807 --> 16:35.599
It costs 16,500 pounds.
Cheaper to 3,000 pounds of Focus RS

16:35.881 --> 16:39.220
that does not have anywhere near that much power.
It does not go to his head.

16:41.061 --> 16:44.344
In ancient times,
a pet with 200 hp was really fast car.

16:44.379 --> 16:47.628
Developing the 0-100 km / h in 7 seconds.
What you eat quickly, but ...

16:47.663 --> 16:52.597
This is Voksal, unsung idiot! Okay, you're right.

16:52.632 --> 16:56.205
No one will want to buy it. And now ...
-Audi TT.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.950
It was found that on your wall you Kul invented

16:58.985 --> 17:01.660
and in which you are putting the cars
without any consultation ... Yeah.

17:01.695 --> 17:04.976
That the TT was cool and then started to move ...

17:05.011 --> 17:08.145
I have to ask. Is the Audi TT cool car?
Raise your hands

17:08.180 --> 17:11.279
those who think it's cool.
Now those who think it's not cool.

17:11.314 --> 17:13.396
There you go, it's not cool.
-You are absolutely right.

17:13.431 --> 17:17.144
It is obvious that they are listened to.
Cool wall began to act.

17:17.179 --> 17:20.858
Now they put a higher engine V6 3.2-liter, 240 hp.

17:21.121 --> 17:23.680
The following transactions R32 in
order to impart a little tower.

17:23.714 --> 17:27.159
Or 240 hp, 225 in each case. This is 15 hp more.

17:27.194 --> 17:29.265
The engine will be more difficult. Yes, it will.

17:29.300 --> 17:32.562
You probably will not be much faster,
but here's what's exciting.

17:32.597 --> 17:35.982
It has an exciting transmission.

17:38.002 --> 17:42.390
It's called DSG. Yeah not a nonsense of Formula 1?

17:42.425 --> 17:45.427
I did not know, so I called and asked
Audi to send me something about it

17:45.462 --> 17:48.968
and behold, they sent, which is great
because this is where you explain everything.

17:50.648 --> 17:53.418
With the control logic
integrated into the junction box,

17:53.453 --> 17:56.328
enables optimum gear changes
carried out by lightning ...

17:57.683 --> 18:02.761
You're rushing to do, we will not understand. You read this part?
-Yes.

18:02.796 --> 18:06.432
It's all in the Manner of reading. A little drama.

18:06.467 --> 18:10.711
As on conventional manual gearboxes,
transmissions are

18:10.746 --> 18:15.721
at the inlet and the auxiliary
shaft in the form of pairs of gears.

18:16.029 --> 18:19.477
Unlike a manual transmission,
the input shaft is divided

18:19.512 --> 18:25.187
into two parts, the outer hollow shaft and ...
Is there any engineers?

18:25.452 --> 18:29.364
Is there someone here who
understands took into engineering?

18:29.399 --> 18:35.560
You? I'll give you this, and until the end of the news
I want to understand everything about the transmission.

18:35.595 --> 18:37.787
Work through it a bit. It's your home.

18:37.822 --> 18:42.726
We have no idea what it is. I do not buy
this car because transmission is not working.

18:43.445 --> 18:47.218
I'd like to call the dealer and say:
"This transmission. I do not know, mate."

18:47.604 --> 18:50.496
"Is it automatic or manual? I do not know, mate."

18:50.888 --> 18:52.829
"This is a magic, that's what."

18:54.240 --> 18:55.982
The only thing we were able to figure out,

18:56.017 --> 18:58.285
Seriously, the whole week we sat in this newsroom

18:58.320 --> 18:59.823
and the only thing we were
able to figure out is that,

19:02.120 --> 19:05.077
having two clutches, that is able to tell

19:05.112 --> 19:08.034
that is ready for insertion into the next gear.

19:08.292 --> 19:12.929
In the third speed and you are accelerating,
how he knows what you want next?

19:12.964 --> 19:15.305
You may think that you will find in the
fourth because they are accelerating,

19:15.340 --> 19:16.797
no, I want to transfer to another.

19:26.003 --> 19:29.561
Last week we decided to find out the fastest faith

19:30.157 --> 19:35.048
and this week we're looking for the
fastest drivers of white vans in the UK.

19:35.083 --> 19:37.596
A few weeks ago we in the
show looking for candidates

19:37.631 --> 19:42.130
and this is how they are reported via e-mail.

19:42.583 --> 19:46.642
We kicked psychotics and other five of us.

19:49.593 --> 19:53.400
Starting from this region are: I'm from Don Kent.

19:53.435 --> 19:55.654
Don from Kent. A driving: A-Ford Escort.

19:55.689 --> 19:59.983
The color?
-White. -Of course. And what you hear in it? -STI Den.

20:00.018 --> 20:04.278
What is your favorite album, "Pretzel Logic"?
- "Gaucho".

20:04.479 --> 20:08.354
I prefer "Rikki Do not Lose That Number."
Nice song.

20:08.389 --> 20:10.953
I hope you win. I love all of them.

20:10.988 --> 20:13.468
I hope you win. Sorry, guys, I love Den styles.

20:13.503 --> 20:15.948
I guess you like Bon Jovi.
-Yes. How did you know?

20:16.417 --> 20:21.269
Because you can not recognize.
You have not shaved, which is ugly.

20:21.304 --> 20:23.653
What will your mother say? And what do you drive?

20:24.359 --> 20:27.180
My pride and joy.
-Nisan Vanes? -Yes.

20:27.433 --> 20:30.473
By profession?
-Heat Engineer. -Vodoinštalatér.

20:31.161 --> 20:36.772
You are?
-John Votrik. What you listening to? Tom Jones. Tom Jones?

20:42.204 --> 20:46.250
It is clear that working for Royal Mail.
I've a bit of a psychopath.

20:46.538 --> 20:51.191
What do you drive?
-Lejland DAF. -You are? -Dejl Miler.

20:51.226 --> 20:56.277
Work for?
-NTL. -NTL Digging roads and miserable our life.

20:56.312 --> 21:01.328
What do you drive?
-Pežo Expert. -Pežo Expert? You stupid name.

21:01.577 --> 21:03.991
You are?
-Stiv Hogan from Amersham.

21:04.026 --> 21:06.600
From Amersham. A work for?
-Island.

21:06.635 --> 21:09.174
A beautiful country.
What are you listening? Would dziś.

21:10.429 --> 21:12.584
I'm rooting for Don and I hope they will win.

21:12.619 --> 21:17.585
Otherwise, they are more vehicles,
and we will see later.

21:17.805 --> 21:20.569
Yes, we'll see what happens. Back in '80.

21:20.778 --> 21:23.719
The most you could have fun in the Super Mini.

21:23.754 --> 21:27.753
They are free and easy, and you could lose it,
but it does not go fast.

21:29.267 --> 21:34.059
Super Minis have become bigger,
heavier, faster and better equipped,

21:34.317 --> 21:38.754
which is nice,
but what if you still want something fun to drive?

21:38.789 --> 21:41.633
Are you in doubt? Let's find out.

21:46.369 --> 21:49.357
Last year, one of every three cars purchased

21:49.392 --> 21:53.410
was a Super Mini. These cars are everywhere.

21:53.445 --> 21:57.428
We're not crazy.
We took the 1.4-liter versions of the car

21:57.724 --> 21:59.467
average class to make it look realistic,

21:59.502 --> 22:03.717
the first being najprosečniji of all,
the Ford Fiesta.

22:04.433 --> 22:08.222
It is a typical Ford.
You have all of the equipment,

22:08.257 --> 22:12.627
but everything is bulging into one
of the ugliest instrument panel

22:12.662 --> 22:16.012
I've ever seen. It's nasty.

22:16.047 --> 22:19.399
The only thing that is doing well is driving.

22:19.434 --> 22:22.751
Not that shines, but really not bad.

22:23.266 --> 22:27.884
Near is that fine sense of vigor that we seek.

22:30.184 --> 22:32.198
The old Fiesta is also good vehicles,

22:32.233 --> 22:35.164
or do not have space in the back seat.

22:35.199 --> 22:38.061
This problem is solved and now has some space.

22:38.096 --> 22:42.651
For 9,995 pounds comes with air conditioning,
but not something more.

22:42.686 --> 22:47.206
Its problem is that it looks boring,
inside and out.

22:47.410 --> 22:49.266
It is better to park in a visible place,

22:49.301 --> 22:51.122
otherwise you will forget that you purchased.

22:51.634 --> 22:54.271
When it launched the new Fiesta,
Ford has managed to move

22:54.306 --> 22:57.748
the small car market is not an inch.

22:57.783 --> 23:01.221
They just look inside and fix old problems.

23:08.202 --> 23:13.615
This looks promising. Citroen C3.
The spiritual successor to the 2CV.

23:13.916 --> 23:19.022
It is far more funky than the Fiesta,
which is a surprise for Citroen

23:19.057 --> 23:24.378
who last year threw out designs
milder chicken in white sauce.

23:25.130 --> 23:27.633
From here, it seems easy, airy and cheerful

23:27.668 --> 23:31.457
as most of the French car, although weak,

23:31.664 --> 23:36.097
When all external parts
fall off after about a week,

23:36.132 --> 23:40.530
the rest of the car will continue to drive,
probably for good.

23:41.550 --> 23:46.367
And the way you will enjoy the ride
smooth and fine, even if was not fast.

23:46.402 --> 23:48.741
There are a handful of nice moves inside,

23:48.776 --> 23:52.514
who do nothing unwise except
they give a lot of storage space.

23:52.549 --> 23:54.947
After all, the only ventilation is ventilation,

23:54.982 --> 23:59.313
and the handle of the door,
when the door opens only elongated.

24:05.808 --> 24:09.733
But there is one person in their own sweet way.

24:17.554 --> 24:19.937
So C3 is sweet, but not smart.

24:19.972 --> 24:23.029
For that you need a lot of
"mozgovitija" Honda Jazz.

24:23.064 --> 24:26.004
Currently, the big hit ispadajući from showrooms

24:26.039 --> 24:28.532
faster than dealers can insert them into them.

24:28.567 --> 24:31.262
If a car is the sum of
everything that people expect

24:31.297 --> 24:34.402
of the Super Mini, it is this one.

24:40.981 --> 24:44.585
The inside is really massive for such a small car.

24:44.620 --> 24:48.154
It's really impressive big and very smart.

24:48.189 --> 24:51.141
To the last centimeter is small, tiny Mini MPV.

24:52.603 --> 24:56.164
But it comes with a downside of an MPV because he

24:56.199 --> 24:57.970
one big box. It is a plosive,

24:58.005 --> 25:03.105
the noise is rejected.
A little it is difficult to drive.

25:03.310 --> 25:05.830
Not quite stable and that is the price you pay.

25:05.865 --> 25:08.315
You can not have quality and size MPV

25:08.350 --> 25:11.481
and at the same time you have
all the attributes of brisk car.

25:13.042 --> 25:16.253
But what we are dropping the price of Jazz.

25:16.288 --> 25:19.368
You will pay 10,300 pounds
for a car of the middle class,

25:19.403 --> 25:24.604
you will have a pay supplement if you
want CD player or aluminum wheels.

25:30.226 --> 25:33.484
But where jazz enters the room-sized cars,

25:33.519 --> 25:36.743
sales of the new funky Nisan Mikre relies on toys

25:36.778 --> 25:39.763
many of which you will never need.

25:39.798 --> 25:42.714
How much you should be sad that you need auto

25:42.749 --> 25:46.853
which will give you a happy birthday?
I prefer friends.

25:48.353 --> 25:50.640
It is made in Sunderland, in the factory

25:50.675 --> 25:52.903
najopsednutijoj quality control in Europe.

25:52.938 --> 25:55.597
And for the same money you
get a bad equipped Jazz,

25:55.632 --> 25:57.726
you can get Mikrá fully armed.

25:57.761 --> 26:03.181
You get alloy wheels, CD player,
toy-sized cars, Keyless.

26:03.216 --> 26:09.032
I have not finished.
Wipers are lit automatically when it rains.

26:09.557 --> 26:11.911
It has sensors that facilitate parking

26:11.946 --> 26:15.482
preparation for the attack in a car
behind you when you go into reverse.

26:16.059 --> 26:18.481
I have the controls on the
steering wheel for stereo,

26:18.711 --> 26:23.188
There is adequate climate control,
not only air conditioning but climate control.

26:25.548 --> 26:28.981
Pleasant and sophisticated, or even represent

26:29.016 --> 26:31.394
today's adults Super Minis in a small,

26:31.429 --> 26:35.762
If you long to hiss and scratch a small car,

26:35.797 --> 26:38.641
you will have to look for something else.

26:41.772 --> 26:46.428
MG ZR. Spoilers, reflectors and bright colors.
Fantastic.

26:46.463 --> 26:50.316
Again in 1983 Discreet like Brigitte
Bardot in the Basque Country,

26:50.351 --> 26:54.170
but you can not resist, not to look at. Is not it?

27:08.651 --> 27:12.786
This is by far the closest to
the original feel of small cars.

27:13.348 --> 27:18.370
No apology and compromise, this is a
small car and represents the best of him.

27:21.355 --> 27:27.142
Do not forget that we elected
superior versions of these cars.

27:27.177 --> 27:32.930
This is the basic 1.4-liter engine ZR,
but the feeling is still special.

27:34.152 --> 27:38.332
10,000 will buy ZR 105 with 105 hp.

27:38.367 --> 27:42.729
This bar is 20 hp more than
all the others we looked at.

27:43.664 --> 27:45.834
Everything is incredibly outdated.

27:45.869 --> 27:50.935
It seems to me that has not been
no attempt to make it ... Nothing.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.228
It's pretty embarrassing.

27:53.263 --> 27:56.705
But it does not matter in the least,
because as soon as you go,

27:56.740 --> 27:59.717
all the work on the suspension,
all those smart things below,

27:59.752 --> 28:04.662
indicate that it is more
meaningful and wants to grips.

28:06.516 --> 28:12.005
All right, is that it is below the
Rover 200 but really deserves MG emblem.

28:12.650 --> 28:16.472
You know what I mean.
You can not understand what is taking place below.

28:17.728 --> 28:20.499
Or body parts will fall away from the shaking.

28:21.327 --> 28:26.509
A loving and curves.
Just loves them. This is a fun car.

28:27.292 --> 28:29.670
Ugly, scary or funny.

28:35.411 --> 28:38.520
So, if you want a practical car:
It's the Honda Jazz.

28:38.555 --> 28:42.541
The producer has just bought.
-Praktičan Man. -In This color.

28:44.854 --> 28:47.765
And if you want a sports car?
Then this is the MG ZR.

28:47.800 --> 28:50.676
On the track,
he was two seconds faster than the other cars.

28:50.711 --> 28:52.678
Two seconds? Yes, it's a huge difference.

28:52.713 --> 28:58.029
Are based on the old Rover 200,
which is in turn based on the Brontosaurus,

28:58.064 --> 29:03.756
or MG did a great job. This is a car that should
be taken if you are interested in these things.

29:04.037 --> 29:10.422
And if the MG managed to do with the Rover,
what will you do with Lotus Lado?

29:14.630 --> 29:16.905
With the deadline only two
weeks to turn Poles Ladu

29:16.940 --> 29:22.523
into something special, Lotus has invested the
last gram of expertise to complete it on time.

29:23.850 --> 29:26.500
A shopping list containing the new brakes,

29:26.535 --> 29:30.168
handmade exhaust system, special lotus black

29:30.203 --> 29:35.349
and handmade finishing work on
the seats of decorator action.

29:37.655 --> 29:40.998
Do you remember the piles
of rust from the workshop?

29:41.618 --> 29:45.414
35 HP now has 180 hp.

29:57.017 --> 29:59.857
After two weeks, and thousands of hours after Pol

29:59.892 --> 30:05.517
left his secreted in the workshop,
the time has come to unite again.

30:05.552 --> 30:10.466
Well, we'll stop here.
Before we do anything, this is virtuously.

30:16.176 --> 30:19.377
What do you think it was?
-They're The tailpipe.

30:20.171 --> 30:23.351
Take off the blindfold and take a look.
How are you feeling? Here we go.

30:23.386 --> 30:25.487
Holy shit!

30:25.522 --> 30:29.762
What are you saying?
-That's awesome. Come have a look at. -God Mild.

30:29.797 --> 30:32.384
Just done a thorough job. Nope it is not.

30:32.592 --> 30:34.802
You'll feel the artwork.

30:35.023 --> 30:39.575
You met Chris.
-Hello. What do you have to tell him? -Thank you very much.

30:39.610 --> 30:45.002
She's beautiful.
-In This is worth more than a thousand hours.

30:45.037 --> 30:50.293
A thousand. And it's not anyone's hours,
but people from Lotus.

30:50.857 --> 30:53.728
The best there is. She's lovely.
Are you satisfied?

30:53.763 --> 30:54.905
I'm really pleased.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.722
When the car arrived and when
the alternator broke down

30:57.757 --> 31:00.397
and when he fell off Radkape, I wondered

31:00.432 --> 31:02.688
what we have to make, but we have more progress

31:02.723 --> 31:04.945
I thought that we will make
something out of this car.

31:04.980 --> 31:08.434
Remember that we switched
the engine under the hood

31:08.469 --> 31:11.435
Fiat's Twin Er,
because the old Ladin was destroyed.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.911
It looks a lot better than ...
It's the same engine.

31:15.842 --> 31:18.322
He helped us a man hired by Lotus

31:18.357 --> 31:22.237
and that is probably the world's
leading authority on this.

31:22.272 --> 31:25.127
The former Formula 1 engineer knows his job.

31:25.162 --> 31:27.948
Stay there to look, while I get this.

31:27.983 --> 31:30.552
He wrote a book about it.
He literally wrote the book.

31:30.973 --> 31:33.978
I've done detailed work.
Where's Rob? Rob, come on.

31:34.013 --> 31:37.028
You're taking a technician?
-Yes. It's official name.

31:37.063 --> 31:40.043
I heard a rumor that you're
literally standing and you know what?

31:40.306 --> 31:45.000
You look terrible. Get some sleep.
Stop thinking about this car.

31:45.404 --> 31:48.894
There is also Gev, we have already met him.
And you met him

31:48.929 --> 31:52.349
because your driving a pile of garbage.
-Bukvalno Killed her.

31:52.384 --> 31:55.763
I think it's time to get you out
on the track and scare to death.

32:00.633 --> 32:02.382
Damn!

32:12.568 --> 32:15.175
It is certainly different. And how different.

32:17.906 --> 32:21.369
What are you going to see is called slippage.

32:22.247 --> 32:24.385
You can proklizavaš.

32:30.298 --> 32:32.764
I'd be too scared to do it.

32:35.511 --> 32:37.004
The real beast.

32:43.401 --> 32:49.749
And here we are. Proof that any car
can be converted into a racing car.

32:49.784 --> 32:55.478
Provided that you have ten people,
two weeks, and 100,000 pounds

32:55.513 --> 33:00.273
how much would it cost to go to
Lotus and ask for the same thing.

33:00.308 --> 33:03.471
So, Paul, you better look so grateful.

33:03.506 --> 33:06.634
I am very grateful. No, look so.

33:07.040 --> 33:12.341
More rewarding than that for people from Lotus.
In fact, kneel. Get on your knees.

33:13.590 --> 33:18.658
They fell down on the floor.

33:27.755 --> 33:31.682
Every week we put a star in
our reasonably priced car,

33:31.717 --> 33:34.957
a week's guest is more than a star,
he is a knight.

33:34.992 --> 33:38.428
Ladies and gentlemen, Sir Michael Gambon.

33:43.483 --> 33:44.544
Who are you?

33:47.057 --> 33:50.347
This week's show is mainly
engaged in driving cars.

33:51.192 --> 33:54.045
Does it fit with your ...
-I do not really,

33:54.080 --> 33:57.175
because'm like glumac. spent his life jam

33:57.210 --> 34:00.357
Traffic West End.
-Drive Belt for buses.

34:00.392 --> 34:03.388
You can pretty fast to drive belt for buses.
-I know.

34:03.423 --> 34:06.384
I tried, but I'm too excited.
-Do You have a Ferrari?

34:06.419 --> 34:09.192
Yes, but it's not a Ferrari,
which would you like to have.

34:09.226 --> 34:12.983
Every time I mention my Ferrari 348.
-This is shocking.

34:13.018 --> 34:16.987
Yes, but I do not care, I like it.

34:18.527 --> 34:21.943
I enjoyed your many roles for many years,

34:21.978 --> 34:25.610
but mostly I liked her role in "Longitude".
Fantastic.

34:25.645 --> 34:30.355
John Harrison, the man who invented
the device that you finding any.

34:30.885 --> 34:34.443
Is there a little bit of it in you?
-Yes. Really?

34:34.478 --> 34:37.186
Because I have a large
engineering workshop at home.

34:37.860 --> 34:45.437
I say things. Like what?
-Svakakve. Watches, mechanical parts.

34:45.472 --> 34:48.092
Besides the fly.
-Yes. I'm not good at it,

34:48.127 --> 34:53.051
because I once ran an actor
who is afraid of flying.

34:53.458 --> 34:58.952
I convinced him to come into my
airplane to prove how much he is safe.

34:59.463 --> 35:03.050
He wanted to travel jumbo jet,
and I told him: "My alike."

35:05.554 --> 35:08.686
It is basically the same.
However, when I crossed the Thames,

35:08.721 --> 35:11.209
in the north, before the London airport opened,

35:11.244 --> 35:13.803
I faked a heart attack.

35:18.560 --> 35:21.149
There is something in me that
wants to constantly joking,

35:21.184 --> 35:24.218
I was a little bit boring, we flew at a height

35:24.253 --> 35:27.253
of 600 meters in the direction of Ipswich,
when I gasped.

35:31.633 --> 35:34.640
I pushed a little left rudder
and held him ten seconds.

35:34.675 --> 35:38.326
Well, the plane began to be tilted.
I could've gotten to see Tower Bridge on the left.

35:39.120 --> 35:43.228
Would you expect it to go crazy?
-Yes. Yes you wanted to record it,

35:43.263 --> 35:46.085
but did nothing. Just sitting?
-Ukipio Be.

35:46.120 --> 35:48.907
He was ready to collapse. He was ready to die.

35:48.942 --> 35:51.274
Then I came to him and I apologized,

35:51.309 --> 35:53.521
but I can not tell you what he said.

35:55.066 --> 35:58.314
Are you still friends?
I do not see each other anymore.

35:59.949 --> 36:02.090
Remind me never to get into the plane with you.

36:02.125 --> 36:05.399
I wanted to ask you, when he plays at
the Royal Scottish theater ... Yes?

36:05.434 --> 36:09.472
Do you sit in the dressing room
and read magazines about cars?

36:09.507 --> 36:13.300
I just got off the play at the Royal
Court Theatre, but this is serious

36:13.335 --> 36:17.093
literary theater.
This is a good way to irritate people,

36:17.128 --> 36:18.865
to sit there with a magazine on automobiles.

36:19.570 --> 36:24.332
The lady Maggie Smith.
Mrs Maggie, see the section "50-70".

36:26.070 --> 36:30.297
They hate it. I think she really likes cars.
I do not know. Really?

36:30.332 --> 36:34.798
Ask her,
so we'll call her to test his luck in Suzuki.

36:35.018 --> 36:38.436
Do you often go to Hollywood? To party with the stars.
-Yes.

36:38.471 --> 36:42.972
I played a little bit.
I played in 5-6 films in Hollywood.

36:43.007 --> 36:45.654
Christian Slater drove me in his Bubi.

36:45.689 --> 36:53.865
There's a great trick. He went out to
the Pacific coastal highway, hit the Hour

36:53.900 --> 36:57.785
and then managed with the help of bow windows.
-Please?

36:57.820 --> 37:01.636
Explain the logic behind it.
-There Is some logic.

37:01.671 --> 37:05.184
If you sit on the handbrake auto ...
-What's up? -Bubu.

37:05.219 --> 37:09.138
Volkswagen's Beetle?
-Yes. It has a large bow windows. More is not true?

37:09.173 --> 37:12.099
No, not true Bubu.
They make this new, but it's Golf.

37:12.134 --> 37:16.278
He sits like and how they move, they act as

37:16.313 --> 37:20.072
rudders on the plane, but can not fly.

37:22.897 --> 37:26.751
So, I sit in the back and he is
sitting in the middle of the car

37:27.171 --> 37:31.029
as in McLaren and do this. I have to ask this.

37:31.064 --> 37:33.030
Sit in the car with Christian Slater,

37:33.065 --> 37:36.581
How did you come about the story?
Did she suddenly said:

37:36.616 --> 37:39.351
"I have a great idea"?
No, we talked about the jokes by car

37:39.386 --> 37:41.254
and then he said: "I'll show you a good joke"

37:41.492 --> 37:44.038
and he did it for me.
And then you told him to attack you?

37:44.073 --> 37:46.158
Yes. That would really be a good joke.

37:46.603 --> 37:49.392
Of course, we are not here just to
be here to talk about what you have,

37:49.427 --> 37:51.410
what you do, the Christian Slater.
-Not.

37:51.632 --> 37:55.753
You came here to try our Suzuki Liana.
-Do not.

37:55.788 --> 37:58.893
You watched the show?
-Yes. -We Have all of these people who have tried out.

37:58.928 --> 38:02.398
These are some of this time,
Harry Enfield's not even close,

38:02.433 --> 38:05.833
He was at the very bottom,
but all the others are here somewhere.

38:05.868 --> 38:08.199
Did the track was wet or dry when you leave?
Very wet.

38:08.234 --> 38:10.949
Very wet. Again? Another wet circuit.

38:10.984 --> 38:13.160
Shall we see what happened?
-Don't.

38:13.195 --> 38:15.351
I'm afraid we will. Leave the tape.

38:19.569 --> 38:21.257
This is pretty good.

38:22.253 --> 38:25.233
You had to look to change the transmission speed,

38:25.873 --> 38:29.693
it is like to move your lips while reading,
and this is what you do.

38:30.555 --> 38:34.342
I have to ask, is this an act?
-Not.

38:34.377 --> 38:39.117
I did not even know that there had been cameras.
-Delujete Quite frightened.

38:40.415 --> 38:42.064
Tires!

38:43.336 --> 38:46.281
You have gone too close to the tires.
Well, that's how it should be.

38:46.316 --> 38:47.916
Yes, it was great.

39:03.086 --> 39:06.936
Before we left, you asked me:

39:06.971 --> 39:09.659
"Did not you roll over it?" And I said, "No, no."

39:10.127 --> 39:12.647
I did not mean it. I thought: "Will it fall over."

39:12.682 --> 39:15.613
Well, that, on the evidence.

39:15.827 --> 39:18.776
Is it horrible? Yeah, I'm scared.

39:18.811 --> 39:21.725
He's completely lifted from the ground.
We need to see it again.

39:23.012 --> 39:28.111
Leave a slow motion. You hit your mark.

39:28.423 --> 39:30.359
And then...

39:35.240 --> 39:38.343
This is a great control.
Is that what happened in štopovanom circle?

39:38.378 --> 39:41.467
Yes. What's my time? Shall we take a look?

39:42.701 --> 39:46.783
Including the truly spectacular moment ...

39:46.818 --> 39:50.865
Did you damage the car? I did.
Fell off the rear-view mirror.

39:52.669 --> 39:55.509
You have damaged our car at a reasonable price?

39:55.544 --> 40:01.142
I wanted to take it back.
-Does not matter. Here we are. Michael Gambon ...

40:01.954 --> 40:08.367
Wet. Another rainy day.
You exported for 1 minute and ...

40:08.402 --> 40:13.247
What do you think?
-I have no idea. -1: 55th

40:20.068 --> 40:24.774
Two seconds faster than Jonathan Ross,
and he rode in dry conditions.

40:26.303 --> 40:29.268
Stig took you out to show you where to drive.
-Yes.

40:29.303 --> 40:33.277
When did you first sit behind the wheel,
he said that since all the other

40:33.312 --> 40:36.962
assess best racing line.

40:38.970 --> 40:41.511
He said that most youngsters are turning this way,

40:41.546 --> 40:45.247
but you were more old bull.
-More Jackie Stewart.

40:46.835 --> 40:50.564
He did not say.
Maybe we could bring Džekija once.

40:50.798 --> 40:53.198
I thought it was Jackie Stewart.

40:53.545 --> 40:56.462
Did you think you were?
-We're. Yes, Jackie's Stig?

40:56.740 --> 40:58.287
Not with that accent.

40:58.675 --> 41:01.624
Do you have any idea who he is?
No, I thought that changed the emphasis.

41:01.659 --> 41:04.605
I do not know. I really have no idea who the Stig.

41:04.640 --> 41:07.551
We thought that maybe Morin from driving schools,

41:09.588 --> 41:12.447
but I do not think so,
judging by slipping in a curve.

41:12.482 --> 41:15.349
He speaks with a French accent, but not French.

41:15.384 --> 41:19.634
He took me to put the A6 Honda RSX.
Scared me shit.

41:24.221 --> 41:27.733
I did not know it was possible
to drive so fast in a curve.

41:27.768 --> 41:29.739
Is it going too sideways?

41:29.774 --> 41:33.957
You were looking through the side window.
-Pripala Me sick in the end.

41:34.272 --> 41:36.795
It was a great pleasure for
us you were the customer.

41:36.830 --> 41:39.525
Ladies and gentlemen, Sir Michael Gambon.

41:50.929 --> 41:57.078
This week's trading news on new cars.
2002 will be a record year

41:57.113 --> 42:00.839
the number of registered cars.
2.5 million units of the new car.

42:00.874 --> 42:04.085
This is about 80,000 more than last year,
but last year was also a record.

42:04.120 --> 42:07.355
The game is a huge amount of
pride among manufacturers sold

42:07.390 --> 42:09.423
most car and those who are second and third.

42:09.458 --> 42:11.774
I know that the first place belong to Ford.

42:11.809 --> 42:15.405
Others will be Voksal GM.
The third will be the Peugeot,

42:15.640 --> 42:20.103
or being a woman fight for fourth
place between Renault and Volkswagen.

42:20.399 --> 42:23.334
The result is that Volkswagen is
desperately fighting for fourth place

42:23.566 --> 42:27.188
made a deal with drug dealers
and basically they offered

42:27.223 --> 42:30.776
something Poloa,
Golf and Passat and gave them a discount of 30%

42:30.811 --> 42:36.295
in some of these models.
This means that something like Passat 2.0 S,

42:36.510 --> 42:39.213
great car normal price of 14,600 pounds,

42:39.248 --> 42:44.286
now on offer for 11,995 pounds.
That's a good deal,

42:44.321 --> 42:47.958
because Pasat really good car
and usually not overrated.

42:49.353 --> 42:54.303
It's almost like the price of the new Golf.
Discount for 2,700 pounds.

42:54.577 --> 42:57.259
There were to be purchased. Fantastic offer.

42:57.294 --> 43:01.631
Now, Suzuki Liana.
We start, auto reasonably priced, 9,995 pounds.

43:01.666 --> 43:03.248
Then we began to occur dealers saying:

43:03.283 --> 43:05.631
"No, we will not sell one for 8,995 pounds",
then 7,995.

43:05.666 --> 43:07.979
This week I received an email
from a dealer in North London,

43:08.014 --> 43:09.912
I can not call it, but they have a powder blue,

43:09.947 --> 43:15.121
just like ours, air conditioning,
ABS, air bags, 7,495 pounds.

43:15.156 --> 43:18.853
Does not anyone take the car every
week even though they show on TV?

43:18.888 --> 43:21.490
I would not know to tell you.
This is an inexpensive car.

43:21.525 --> 43:24.949
This is abnormal reasonable.
And finally, re-registered car.

43:24.984 --> 43:29.247
This is something that manufacturers are
working to raise the number of registered cars.

43:29.282 --> 43:32.346
Basically,
the whole bunch register rings on their behalf,

43:32.381 --> 43:35.014
and then trying to sell them.
-So, Are not sold them,

43:35.049 --> 43:38.392
but the number of registered kola grows.
So all this is a battle

43:38.427 --> 43:41.219
to reach the fourth place. Absolutely.
-I realized.

43:41.254 --> 43:43.977
In the end, they have to find a home for them,
so they appear on the market

43:44.012 --> 43:47.201
as polovnjaci,
but if you buy it when the time comes to sell it

43:47.236 --> 43:49.815
will have two previous owners.
You and manufacturers.

43:49.850 --> 43:52.359
It makes no difference in price,
but the real difference

43:52.394 --> 43:55.451
the price that you're paying now.
This week they offered me

43:55.486 --> 43:58.509
Reno Senik, remember,
Reno is in the race for fourth place.

43:58.710 --> 44:02.050
Normal price had 12,500.
This is a 1.4 engine, has air conditioning,

44:02.085 --> 44:05.986
alloy wheels, a real car.
They offered it to me this week to 9,000 pounds.

44:06.021 --> 44:08.055
This is very useful family car for 9,000 pounds.

44:08.090 --> 44:10.779
Without milage. Maybe 3-4 km.

44:10.814 --> 44:13.229
If you want something even cheaper,
how about this:

44:13.264 --> 44:17.583
Ford Focus 1.4 CL, three-door,
the normal price is 10,500.

44:17.865 --> 44:22.327
At this moment you can buy registered for 7,795 pounds.
-Good price. -Yes.

44:22.362 --> 44:26.020
And finally, if you want something really cheap,
remember, last week

44:26.055 --> 44:30.026
Ford Ka, the normal price of 6,500,
some dealers have been lowered to 4,995.

44:30.061 --> 44:33.998
How about this option:
pre-registered Fiat Punto Mia 1.2

44:34.033 --> 44:40.253
three doors, 4,995. And now: the '40s and' 50s

44:40.288 --> 44:45.851
Maserati was exotic,
nenabavljiv as a banana or nylon.

44:46.542 --> 44:51.116
Now that I think about it,
it was desirable as a banana in a nylon stocking.

44:51.750 --> 44:54.803
But by the time I started to notice things

44:54.838 --> 44:57.856
Maserati was a wreck with
2 turbos along the road M1.

44:57.891 --> 45:02.501
However, it is now assumed Ferrari Maserati

45:02.809 --> 45:07.538
and again is considered to act chic and tropical.

45:23.263 --> 45:27.931
This is the last model.
You've seen the style of a coupe earlier.

45:27.966 --> 45:31.749
Not very nice,
but not a new taillights do not help.

45:33.389 --> 45:36.229
But there is something else.

45:38.275 --> 45:44.777
It has a new engine, 4.2 liter V8.
He replaced the old 3.2-liter turbo.

45:45.029 --> 45:48.915
I develop nearly 400 hp.

45:49.782 --> 45:53.389
And what is that in this day and age?
Almost 400 system.

45:54.158 --> 45:58.725
As you almost 180 cm tall.
You recently won the lottery.

46:04.186 --> 46:07.941
And then we're going in
spite of these elegant hinges

46:07.976 --> 46:12.241
and the gentle cheats,
we learn that there are four seats.

46:12.276 --> 46:16.506
also find and watch how to
pay tribute to Dave Brent

46:16.541 --> 46:17.938
for retirement.

46:17.973 --> 46:22.264
We find something that Maserati is called
"Cambio korsa"

46:22.558 --> 46:27.195
and we call him stupid, idiotic Formula 1 gearbox.

46:28.144 --> 46:29.348
Great.

46:32.156 --> 46:35.125
Will not start. Why will not it work?

46:35.932 --> 46:38.245
This must be ler.

46:40.055 --> 46:43.109
Are you going to enter into neutral?
My foot is on the brake.

46:43.622 --> 46:47.549
Here we are, ler.
Glossy these gearboxes. I adore them.

46:48.197 --> 46:50.935
Sad beeps at me. We moved.

47:06.103 --> 47:10.057
However,
there are two good things about this transmission.

47:10.092 --> 47:14.011
First of all,
the system is the same as that of the Ferrari 575,

47:14.046 --> 47:19.576
but in a Ferrari costs 6,000, 3,000 and at this.

47:19.795 --> 47:22.651
Another good thing is that
you do not have to take it.

47:22.686 --> 47:25.192
You can take a normal manual gearbox,

47:25.227 --> 47:30.988
which means that your head will shake
every time you insert it in gear.

47:33.469 --> 47:35.988
God, that's disgusting.

47:54.777 --> 47:59.947
The old engine is not very interested in me,
but this is not bad.

48:04.458 --> 48:08.021
To gain strength in the way,
Maserati comes in four

48:08.056 --> 48:11.585
different settings for all.
Transmission, seats, everything.

48:11.866 --> 48:14.924
Just think of all that the Italian electronics.

48:15.460 --> 48:18.523
And there is something called Skyhook suspension

48:18.558 --> 48:21.679
which can be adjusted to your every mood.

48:21.714 --> 48:24.710
It sounds nice, but it is not.

48:29.218 --> 48:32.123
The problem is that when you press the "sport"

48:32.158 --> 48:36.379
to secure and tighten all the gear,

48:36.414 --> 48:40.601
turns from almond cream marshmallow.

48:42.114 --> 48:46.751
Do not drive this car as much as you stick to.

49:06.539 --> 49:08.845
And woe to the one who thought that the

49:08.846 --> 49:12.766
turn off the traction control a good idea.

49:15.442 --> 49:19.253
Here's our hammer curve. Oh my God.

49:19.626 --> 49:21.977
I screwed it up.

49:26.957 --> 49:29.723
So I tried again.

49:34.819 --> 49:38.161
Again, I screwed up and I'm pissed.

49:42.524 --> 49:48.565
I've never had a problem on this
kind of track I have in this car.

49:53.461 --> 49:56.039
This, then, is not a sports car.

49:56.074 --> 50:00.254
Frankly, the sooner you will find
a sports car if you turn to watch

50:00.480 --> 50:02.275
"Monarch of the valley" or "heartbeats"

50:02.310 --> 50:05.253
or drama of any period which is given to the TV.

50:05.818 --> 50:09.922
Helmet Nika Beriah works sportier than this.

50:11.532 --> 50:17.146
But this car might not built to be
the driving rival Porsche and Ferrari.

50:17.401 --> 50:20.433
Perhaps it is meant to be the pasta Bolognese,

50:20.468 --> 50:25.414
alternative to roast beef and
Yorkshire pudding as Jaguar.

50:30.407 --> 50:33.323
And in this case, where the abundance?

50:33.558 --> 50:37.819
Why they built the narrow
school chairs instead of seats?

50:37.854 --> 50:42.080
Where is the sense of wellbeing
that provides Jaguar XKR?

50:42.573 --> 50:47.054
Do you know what this is?
"Mr. Almost Autić" worth 61,000 pounds,

50:47.302 --> 50:53.170
Stuck somewhere in no man's land between
the Jaguar and Ferrari's hammer anvil.

50:54.791 --> 50:57.971
So, not good?
-Not really.

50:58.006 --> 51:01.757
From the audience hear only is
horrible and it is not so good,

51:01.792 --> 51:05.509
but it is not so, because if you will,
there's a lot of space,

51:05.544 --> 51:08.313
I admit it, but if you want a comfortable cruiser,

51:08.348 --> 51:11.770
buy a Jaguar or Mercedes SL,
and if you want to dry performance,

51:11.805 --> 51:15.692
Porsche, Ferrari, you know.
-More They are worth to buy DB7.

51:15.727 --> 51:19.579
Yes, much more.
But there is another chance to redeem himself.

51:20.718 --> 51:22.826
Pour Stiga.

51:23.314 --> 51:25.699
I started,
but she does not care how long it will take him

51:25.734 --> 51:29.452
to pass a circle,
because it has already spent 15 minutes to start

51:29.487 --> 51:33.171
and adjust transmission and
suspension to his relentless taste.

51:33.206 --> 51:36.111
Of course, to choose the appropriate CD.

51:43.482 --> 51:46.751
Approaching the hammer head and if
he could he visit without turning,

51:46.786 --> 51:50.503
we may let him down and sits
by the fire on Christmas Day.

51:54.975 --> 51:56.422
He managed!

52:01.164 --> 52:03.504
Increases strength,
and that "Masi" is not missing,

52:03.539 --> 52:07.326
up tremendous speed until it
reaches the last two corners.

52:07.719 --> 52:10.542
Here comes the bend which will
from now on be known as Gambon.

52:10.577 --> 52:13.932
Not passed laterally Michael
and exceed the target!

52:15.223 --> 52:22.163
Brilliant ride, but not brilliant time. 1:38 PM.

52:22.696 --> 52:27.515
This is only slightly faster than the Bentley. Not a very good car.
-Not.

52:27.778 --> 52:30.485
A little earlier, we met with our van drivers.

52:30.520 --> 52:33.193
Bleje around, having fun,
struggling with crossword puzzle from Sana

52:33.228 --> 52:35.903
and watch the girls. But here they are again.

52:35.938 --> 52:38.980
And all considered to be
useful in the way of the wheel.

52:39.015 --> 52:42.023
But how do they do?
Somewhere where there is no possibility

52:42.058 --> 52:44.688
that someone ripped off the
rearview mirror by the door.

52:45.216 --> 52:47.880
Of course,
they all came with weapons of your choice,

52:47.915 --> 52:51.706
But today it will not be used,
because if you are looking for the fastest

52:51.741 --> 52:55.581
van driver, you need a special van:

52:56.142 --> 52:59.458
Ford World Rally Transit,
and is not just a nice painted.

52:59.493 --> 53:02.784
The engine was modified to achieve 200 hp.

53:02.819 --> 53:06.884
There racing wheels, brakes,
suspension and exhaust.

53:07.546 --> 53:12.851
A look at this. Even the interior of the race.

53:23.580 --> 53:27.406
Well, now to business.
The first is John from Royal mail.

53:27.801 --> 53:30.882
That's it. Are you a wimp or are you kombadžija?

53:38.436 --> 53:40.890
Are drivers Rojal mails generally quick?

53:42.849 --> 53:45.474
Where they are not. Everywhere these intersect.

53:46.378 --> 53:48.304
And while the postman Five was on the track,

53:48.339 --> 53:51.660
I picked up the occasional
crumb of wisdom van driver.

53:51.695 --> 53:54.982
They are the worst in the world, brother.
All women drivers.

54:01.691 --> 54:05.717
Next up was Steve from Iceland.
The companies, not the state.

54:08.413 --> 54:10.832
I have attached the wrong speed.

54:15.536 --> 54:19.486
This is the type that yesterday
destroyed a police car. Really?

54:19.521 --> 54:24.829
Yes. When she went into reverse.
He smashed them. In its Island van.

54:29.838 --> 54:33.336
Is there a technique for driving the van?
Yeah, just step on.

54:33.371 --> 54:34.914
Just step? That's good.

54:36.666 --> 54:38.754
Steve, please do not spoil it. It's always helpful

54:38.789 --> 54:41.574
to leave a couple of dents,
but these are more people leaning out of the way.

54:41.895 --> 54:44.934
And Steve was determined to add some extra ones.

54:57.910 --> 55:01.238
Next was Don who got lost on the way.

55:01.466 --> 55:04.225
There. And then left.

55:17.719 --> 55:22.103
And of course, once again lost.

55:22.679 --> 55:24.991
Again he was wrong.

55:26.877 --> 55:28.386
Over here!

55:29.230 --> 55:31.339
Left, left!

55:40.811 --> 55:43.040
He made.

55:43.387 --> 55:45.849
Dale was ćutljivko in society.

55:45.884 --> 55:48.940
He left the driving to speak for him.

55:54.746 --> 55:56.759
You should let the clutch.

55:58.302 --> 56:03.684
At last. He says the driver of the van.
Silent and deadly with speed.

56:08.582 --> 56:14.364
And that strikes a classic finals on
Friday at 17:29, maneuver back to the base.

56:19.559 --> 56:21.105
He got the tire.

56:24.951 --> 56:27.493
Because you're going to get out of a bad name.

56:28.507 --> 56:30.809
The man that does not lack confidence, Roger,

56:30.844 --> 56:33.912
How are you feeling?
-Very good. Poteraj me.

56:42.721 --> 56:44.530
And another old fashioned kombadžija.

56:44.565 --> 56:47.203
I do not mean to be picky at other people's tires,

56:49.946 --> 56:53.531
nor cares how much the marked path.

56:57.702 --> 57:02.506
All in all,
his tactics had provided good fast circuit.

57:02.953 --> 57:05.594
That was good, right? Smooth.

57:13.694 --> 57:18.500
Okay, fine. Here we have the results.

57:18.726 --> 57:23.270
In fifth place ...
I was rooting for you, and you're lost!

57:25.048 --> 57:27.299
You were useless.

57:27.467 --> 57:35.093
Most took 2 minutes, 2:10, 4:55 and you.

57:37.233 --> 57:42.750
And that's why we give you a false prize,
which is part mirrors

57:42.785 --> 57:48.568
that Michael Gambon was cut with Suzuki Vines.

57:48.603 --> 57:51.956
Here, Done. Thank you, Jeremy.

57:53.516 --> 57:59.323
Now the rest of the results: On the 4th,
2:09, postman John. Congratulations.

58:01.737 --> 58:06.767
In 3rd place, plumber Roger.
-Heat Engineer.

58:07.087 --> 58:08.447
Plumber.

58:08.482 --> 58:11.361
9.

58:12.996 --> 58:18.878
Stations gusto. 2:03, Steve Iceland.

58:20.148 --> 58:22.306
And that means ...

58:23.578 --> 58:29.525
Jason, get the trophy,
because the winner Dale from NTL-a. 2:02.

58:34.367 --> 58:37.161
Congratulations, Dale. Congratulations.

58:37.196 --> 58:42.311
Next week we will have a full
program of all the cars. Goodnight.
