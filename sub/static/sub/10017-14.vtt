01:04.099 --> 01:06.190
- Good morning.
- I wouldn't go that far.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.364
You can't be crabby.
You were off yesterday.

01:08.565 --> 01:12.018
- Morgenstern called about Vennerbeck.
- That MI that crumped?

01:12.230 --> 01:14.320
Kayson claims I presented
the case incompetently.

01:14.529 --> 01:17.119
Morgenstern wants me
in his office in an hour.

01:17.328 --> 01:18.691
I wanna throw up.

01:18.894 --> 01:22.655
Kayson's just trying to cover his ass.
Morgenstern knows that.

01:23.193 --> 01:25.852
Maybe I'll get lucky
and Kayson'll fall in front...

01:26.058 --> 01:28.148
lx-nay on the Ayson-kay.

01:28.890 --> 01:30.981
- Good morning, Dr. Greene.
- Morning.

01:40.454 --> 01:42.078
- You seen Carter?
- Took a DB to 4.

01:42.286 --> 01:45.274
- Pathology's backed up.
- Yeah, what else is new?

01:51.183 --> 01:53.115
Oh, sorry! Excuse me.

01:53.782 --> 01:54.838
Dr. Benton?

01:56.082 --> 01:57.069
Carter.

01:57.514 --> 01:58.501
Carter!

01:59.046 --> 02:00.205
What are you doing?

02:00.413 --> 02:02.241
- Sleeping.
- Sleep when I tell you.

02:02.446 --> 02:05.309
Get up. I got a new student
for you to break in.

02:06.711 --> 02:07.699
Come here.

02:08.610 --> 02:09.597
- What's your name?
- Deb.

02:09.810 --> 02:13.172
This is Carter, he'll show you around.
She's all yours.

02:13.375 --> 02:16.806
- Dr. Benton, you're not going...
- Yes, I am. And no, you can't.

02:17.007 --> 02:19.029
I've got wall-to-wall surgeries.

02:19.239 --> 02:21.670
The last thing I need
is to babysit you.

02:25.004 --> 02:26.594
Is he really dead?

02:26.904 --> 02:29.869
Five bucks gets you
Super Lotto and Insta-pick.

02:30.069 --> 02:31.500
- Timmy?
- Pass.

02:31.702 --> 02:32.861
- Carol?
- Oh, why not?

02:33.068 --> 02:35.192
Morning, gang.
Timmy, what do we got?

02:35.400 --> 02:38.627
Our specials for today are:
Suicidal junkie in 4.

02:38.833 --> 02:40.627
- Going once...
- I'll take it.

02:40.832 --> 02:42.922
I could use a little cheering up.

02:43.131 --> 02:45.028
Hamster vs. Finger
in the Suture Room.

02:45.230 --> 02:46.218
Ross took it.

02:46.430 --> 02:50.020
HIV-positive kid with a busted tooth
in one. Lots of blood.

02:50.228 --> 02:51.591
What's an LL owie?

02:51.795 --> 02:54.260
Scissors in the left leg.
A medical term.

02:54.460 --> 02:56.789
- Ubaldo's back, stinky as ever.
- Oh, man!

02:56.993 --> 02:58.924
He's drunk, possible seizure.

02:59.125 --> 03:00.522
Double-glove time.

03:03.957 --> 03:05.355
So is this the perp?

03:05.556 --> 03:07.646
His name is Royden B.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.911
I thought you'd want to
check him for rabies.

03:10.121 --> 03:13.052
The only way that Royden B.
Could have rabies...

03:13.254 --> 03:15.378
...is if he's been bitten
by a wild animal.

03:15.586 --> 03:18.016
Given his lifestyle,
that's unlikely.

03:18.218 --> 03:21.615
That finger's infected, probably
because Lucy's been sucking on it.

03:21.817 --> 03:25.578
We'll clean it, give her antibiotics,
and your daughter'll be fine.

03:25.749 --> 03:26.772
Niece.

03:27.215 --> 03:28.203
Niece, sorry.

03:28.648 --> 03:30.909
There was a family resemblance.

03:31.514 --> 03:33.502
You go to the Fifth Street Gym?

03:34.047 --> 03:35.444
No. I've never been.

03:36.346 --> 03:37.834
My mistake...

03:38.211 --> 03:40.267
...but you work out.
I can tell.

03:41.144 --> 03:42.132
Excuse me.

03:43.343 --> 03:46.967
Well, you know, I play a little
basketball now and then.

03:47.175 --> 03:49.662
- Bulls fan?
- Yeah. I'm a Bulls fan.

03:49.874 --> 03:53.135
I have a friend who can
get tickets. Courtside.

03:53.439 --> 03:55.462
That is, if you're interested.

03:58.837 --> 04:01.563
I have tickets, so maybe
I'll see you there.

04:10.433 --> 04:11.694
Care for a drink?

04:11.899 --> 04:13.092
After you.

04:14.565 --> 04:16.462
- You get away for the weekend?
- Yeah.

04:16.665 --> 04:19.494
Tag and I rented a cottage
in Door County on the lake.

04:19.697 --> 04:22.161
- Went ice fishing.
- That was the highlight?

04:22.362 --> 04:24.123
The one I can tell you about.

04:25.194 --> 04:26.591
Have you set a date yet?

04:26.827 --> 04:30.383
Why does everyone keep asking that?
What's the big rush?

04:30.593 --> 04:31.581
Sorry I asked.

04:31.792 --> 04:35.349
It's just, I feel like I'd
finally gotten my life in order...

04:35.557 --> 04:37.420
...and now it's all shaken up again.

04:37.590 --> 04:38.749
You having doubts?

04:38.957 --> 04:40.819
Well, it's a big step.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.484
It's natural to have
some doubts, right?

04:43.688 --> 04:45.449
Maybe it's the forever part.

04:45.655 --> 04:48.279
It's like infinity,
it's hard to get a handle...

04:48.986 --> 04:49.974
What?

05:50.365 --> 05:51.421
Bye-bye.

05:52.897 --> 05:54.795
That was more than an
invitation to basketball.

05:54.996 --> 05:56.825
I know. I've been invited
to basketball games.

05:57.029 --> 05:59.221
- So what?
- So I want an explanation.

05:59.427 --> 06:00.654
Mark, grow up.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.951
Does this mean you
and Linda are serious?

06:03.159 --> 06:06.147
Serious? Our longest phone
conversation is "Get over here."

06:06.359 --> 06:08.517
Yeah. So what happened in there?

06:08.725 --> 06:11.884
- I've been summoned.
- Don't worry. It'll be fine.

06:12.090 --> 06:15.646
I'm just curious how you can
turn down guaranteed sex...

06:15.855 --> 06:17.877
...with an undeniably
attractive woman.

06:18.088 --> 06:21.417
If that's all there is,
I'd rather play tennis.

06:21.653 --> 06:24.278
This is very disappointing
coming from you.

06:25.019 --> 06:27.643
Nine times I've been stuck.
Never even caught the flu.

06:27.851 --> 06:30.407
- I've been lucky so far.
- This makes 5 for me.

06:30.617 --> 06:33.878
Isn't the chance of getting HIV
from a needle-stick 1 in 100?

06:34.082 --> 06:36.309
One out of 250
if the patient's infected.

06:36.514 --> 06:40.104
When Ubaldo wakes up, I'll try and
consent him so we can test him.

06:40.313 --> 06:42.937
- I'll get his T cell count regardless.
- Thanks, Lydia.

06:43.145 --> 06:44.633
It says here to be safe...

06:44.845 --> 06:48.072
...you shouldn't have unprotected sex
until after the follow-up...

06:48.277 --> 06:49.902
...in six months.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.870
Thanks, Wendy.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.131
I'm Dr. Greene.

06:58.341 --> 07:00.931
- Serena, U.S. Customs.
- We're going this way.

07:01.139 --> 07:03.502
- What's the problem?
- Picked him up at O'Hare.

07:03.705 --> 07:08.159
He's a body packer. He's got cocaine
in his belly wrapped in condoms.

07:08.370 --> 07:10.131
Here, sit right here.

07:11.336 --> 07:12.699
- What's your name?
- Jorge.

07:12.902 --> 07:14.492
He doesn't speak English.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.427
He's been retaining the
evidence for 8 days.

07:17.633 --> 07:20.564
Eight days? Sounds like one for
the Guinness Book of Records.

07:20.765 --> 07:23.162
Can't blame him for trying.
He's facing 20 years.

07:23.365 --> 07:25.421
No obvious signs of toxicity.

07:25.631 --> 07:27.357
The condoms must still be intact.

07:27.563 --> 07:29.994
If you can give him a laxative,
it'd make my job easier.

07:30.195 --> 07:33.251
I can't give him any medication
without his consent.

07:33.461 --> 07:35.949
Borrow a pen?
We'll work him up, x-ray him...

07:36.160 --> 07:40.114
...hope that nature takes its course
before a condom breaks.

07:55.054 --> 07:56.746
Where'd you learn Spanish?

07:56.953 --> 07:58.044
Here.

07:58.985 --> 08:01.678
We work Benton's hours,
sleep when he sleeps. Never.

08:01.884 --> 08:03.941
We've been on call since yesterday.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.604
This is an IV cart. Most patients
get an IV when they come in.

08:07.815 --> 08:11.008
Angiocath 16 needle if they're
bleeding. You can start an IV?

08:11.215 --> 08:14.078
- Yeah. Actually, no.
- I thought you were third year.

08:14.280 --> 08:18.643
A body packer in four. Work him up.
KUB, drug screen, urinalysis.

08:18.845 --> 08:20.276
Ever do a urinalysis?

08:20.477 --> 08:22.272
Carter, do a rectal.

08:22.476 --> 08:24.374
This is your lucky day.

08:33.606 --> 08:35.469
- What do we got?
- Respiratory distress.

08:35.673 --> 08:38.761
- He crashed.
- From bradycardic at 35 to flatline.

08:38.971 --> 08:40.493
Temp's 104.
Blood cultures sent.

08:40.703 --> 08:43.601
Septic shock. Give him
an amp of epi, a mig of atropine...

08:43.803 --> 08:46.529
...1.5 of each Erythro and cefotaxime.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.495
- What's going on?
- You his father?

08:48.701 --> 08:50.962
- Yes.
- We're stimulating his heart.

08:51.167 --> 08:52.927
Epi and atropine on board.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.121
- Any heart sounds?
- Negative.

08:55.332 --> 08:57.854
Piggyback an Isuprel drip.
This ever happen before?

08:58.064 --> 08:59.723
Once, when he had pneumonia.

08:59.931 --> 09:01.521
- Cerebral palsy?
- Brain damage.

09:01.729 --> 09:04.320
- Got a pulse.
- All right, heart's back.

09:10.660 --> 09:12.387
- He's in V-tach.
- What the hell?

09:12.593 --> 09:15.751
Hold the Isuprel now,
and give him lidocaine.

09:15.958 --> 09:17.514
Fifty milligrams, IV push.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.984
- What's happening?
- His heart is racing.

09:20.156 --> 09:21.144
- Why?
- I don't know.

09:21.356 --> 09:24.411
Let's get the 12-lead in there
and see what's going on.

09:24.621 --> 09:25.881
Move that.

09:26.087 --> 09:28.780
Move it. Draw petrillian.

09:31.219 --> 09:33.446
I told Kayson this kind of
finger-pointing...

09:33.652 --> 09:37.083
...runs contrary to the spirit
of a teaching hospital.

09:37.284 --> 09:39.681
- Juice?
- No, thank you.

09:40.216 --> 09:44.011
He failed to see my point.
He's bringing disciplinary charges.

09:44.215 --> 09:46.476
What does that mean, exactly?

09:46.747 --> 09:49.338
You'll come before the committee,
defend yourself.

09:49.546 --> 09:52.636
We'll make a determination
and take steps accordingly.

09:52.845 --> 09:56.708
Dr. Morgenstern, I tried
to present Mr. Vennerbeck's history.

09:56.910 --> 09:59.001
Dr. Kayson cut me off
and released him.

09:59.209 --> 10:00.936
The specifics don't concern me...

10:01.142 --> 10:04.834
...nearly as much as your
inability to assert yourself.

10:05.140 --> 10:06.197
Excuse me?

10:06.407 --> 10:08.497
You allowed Kayson to intimidate you.

10:08.705 --> 10:09.898
Not the first time.

10:10.106 --> 10:13.593
I recall a similar incident with
Benton about an appendix.

10:13.805 --> 10:15.134
I was right about that.

10:15.336 --> 10:17.995
But you deferred to Benton's judgment.

10:18.203 --> 10:21.258
You lack the authority
to put forward your own opinions.

10:21.468 --> 10:24.228
To act as an aggressive
advocate for your patients.

10:25.433 --> 10:28.330
I guess I have to work on that.

10:28.533 --> 10:29.930
Yes, you do.

10:35.563 --> 10:36.823
Confidence.

10:37.196 --> 10:39.593
Composure under pressure.
Assertiveness.

10:39.795 --> 10:43.692
These are the requisite qualities
of a good ER specialist.

10:44.959 --> 10:47.220
I'll give you the chance
to develop them.

10:47.425 --> 10:49.390
If you don't, we'll have
a discussion...

10:49.591 --> 10:53.147
...about which specialty
might best match your temperament.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.718
Peaked T waves, unstable rhythm.
Gotta be potassium, right?

10:59.921 --> 11:01.250
- His lytes back?
- Not yet.

11:01.454 --> 11:04.044
Can't wait. Give him
calcium gluconate 15 mils.

11:04.253 --> 11:06.377
- It could kill him.
- Just do it.

11:06.585 --> 11:09.550
- Asystole.
- All right, repeat epi and atropine.

11:09.751 --> 11:12.840
- Doctor?
- Your son's potassium is too high.

11:13.049 --> 11:15.606
Probably from renal failure.
We'll try to bring it down.

11:15.815 --> 11:18.076
I got a pulse.
Weak, but it's there.

11:18.281 --> 11:20.542
- BP 35 palp.
- I'll take it.

11:21.946 --> 11:23.968
Lytes are back.
Potassium's high, 7.5.

11:24.179 --> 11:27.144
We're on the right track.
Stand by with glucose and insulin.

11:27.345 --> 11:28.367
Is he gonna live?

11:28.778 --> 11:30.368
Looks like he'll make it.

11:43.072 --> 11:46.504
I heard you got stuck again.
What is it, number four?

11:46.705 --> 11:49.863
- Count them.
- Five. Wow! I've only got three.

11:50.070 --> 11:54.125
Put me down for emptying the sharps
containers. I need to catch up.

11:54.335 --> 11:55.766
Don't tempt the Fates.

11:55.968 --> 11:59.127
- You and Tag set a date yet?
- Not yet.

12:03.798 --> 12:04.786
How'd it go?

12:04.998 --> 12:07.519
How'd it go?
Well, it's hard to describe.

12:07.730 --> 12:09.718
Timmy, where's Petrofsky's chart?

12:09.929 --> 12:11.326
Why? What happened?

12:11.995 --> 12:15.256
If I told you right now,
I think I'd lose it.

12:17.893 --> 12:19.722
Go down to Exam Two.

12:19.925 --> 12:22.686
- You live at the Marymount Home?
- For the emotionally disabled.

12:22.891 --> 12:24.754
That's what society has labeled me.

12:24.958 --> 12:27.479
- What's open?
- Trauma. Everything else is full.

12:27.690 --> 12:29.985
When did the
shortness of breath start?

12:30.189 --> 12:32.585
A month ago.
But this week it got worse.

12:32.788 --> 12:34.014
Are you on medication?

12:34.221 --> 12:37.879
Yes. This is my medical binder.
I've kept it since I was 14.

12:38.086 --> 12:41.812
Medications are in orange.
Actually, it'd be more pumpkin.

12:42.018 --> 12:45.505
And you take lithium,
Depakote and Synthroid.

12:45.716 --> 12:47.375
Yes. I've taken these.

12:48.049 --> 12:50.571
My allergy section.
These pages are mauve.

12:50.782 --> 12:52.747
Vaccinations are gray.

12:53.048 --> 12:55.104
Doctors' names and numbers
are plum...

12:55.313 --> 12:58.278
...and past medical records
are in various shades of red...

12:58.479 --> 13:00.967
...from vermillion to puce.

13:01.178 --> 13:02.200
Very colorful.

13:02.377 --> 13:03.365
Thank you.

13:03.777 --> 13:07.435
- And you're dressed all in blue.
- Yes. It's Monday.

13:15.339 --> 13:16.635
Come on in, Alan.

13:18.072 --> 13:19.059
I can't.

13:19.271 --> 13:21.066
- Why not?
- It's green.

13:22.437 --> 13:23.697
Is that bad?

13:25.069 --> 13:26.194
Very.

13:35.033 --> 13:36.225
He asleep?

13:36.432 --> 13:38.693
Yeah. I went and got
a few of his things.

13:38.897 --> 13:41.294
Ben's pretty sick.
He's got pneumonia...

13:41.497 --> 13:43.860
...which caused his heart
problems earlier.

13:44.062 --> 13:45.584
I hope the antibiotics
will help.

13:45.795 --> 13:47.726
Last time they put him
on a ventilator.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.450
We may do that if his
blood gases don't improve.

13:50.660 --> 13:54.023
- When will you know?
- We'll check in an hour or so.

14:00.490 --> 14:01.921
He likes rhythm.

14:03.222 --> 14:06.619
Before the accident, he was
taking trumpet lessons.

14:07.521 --> 14:09.645
He used the metronome to practice.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.579
I don't think he remembers.

14:15.452 --> 14:17.077
Kid had a hell of a bat.

14:18.384 --> 14:21.837
Now if that picture isn't there
when he wakes up, he gets this look.

14:24.815 --> 14:26.610
What happened?

14:30.846 --> 14:33.141
He's on his bike,
an 85-year-old man...

14:33.345 --> 14:34.934
...waves Ben across the street...

14:35.144 --> 14:37.938
...then gets confused between
the brake and the accelerator.

14:39.576 --> 14:40.633
Look...

14:40.842 --> 14:42.172
...I got a job interview.

14:49.473 --> 14:50.665
You got kids?

14:51.838 --> 14:52.963
I have a son.

14:53.172 --> 14:55.228
- How old?
- He's eight.

14:55.737 --> 14:57.225
That's a nice age.

15:01.369 --> 15:05.822
Okay, Deb. As we say around here
quite often, "Glove up and dig in."

15:06.033 --> 15:07.896
Carter, isn't that your job?

15:08.099 --> 15:09.326
Deb's gotta learn.

15:10.432 --> 15:11.954
Exactly what do I look for?

15:12.165 --> 15:15.459
Obstructions, masses,
anything out of the ordinary.

15:15.797 --> 15:18.285
But I don't have anything
to compare it to.

15:18.495 --> 15:19.858
You will soon.

15:22.028 --> 15:25.049
Mr. Jorge, could you turn
on your side, please?

15:26.260 --> 15:27.247
Thank you.

15:29.792 --> 15:30.916
I'm sorry.

15:33.357 --> 15:34.617
Everything okay?

15:35.157 --> 15:38.349
Well, he seems a little tense.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.181
Show him who's boss.

15:42.654 --> 15:43.641
Sorry.

15:44.453 --> 15:46.112
<i>Santa Maria!</i>

15:48.818 --> 15:50.477
How's it going in there?

15:51.583 --> 15:53.412
I'm stuck.

15:54.350 --> 15:56.247
- Deb?
- Yes?

15:56.449 --> 15:58.346
Did you use any lubricant?

15:59.814 --> 16:01.837
Was I supposed to?

16:02.680 --> 16:04.145
Breathe.

16:05.446 --> 16:07.070
Fever's 101.

16:07.278 --> 16:10.175
Have your doctors told you
you have a heart murmur?

16:11.443 --> 16:13.068
I don't think so.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.037
I could check my book, though.

16:15.242 --> 16:16.707
Have you had a cough lately?

16:16.875 --> 16:17.863
Yes.

16:18.074 --> 16:20.006
Loose cough, bringing up sputum?

16:20.174 --> 16:21.161
Yes.

16:21.640 --> 16:22.866
What color?

16:24.606 --> 16:25.628
Sort of a...

16:26.005 --> 16:29.561
...sulphur yellow with saffron mixed in.
Kind of like these tiles here.

16:29.771 --> 16:33.565
But more of a yellow... These are more
yellow-beige, I suppose.

16:33.769 --> 16:35.394
Alan's into colors.

16:35.602 --> 16:36.828
I see.

16:37.068 --> 16:39.589
I want to run some tests,
do a chest x-ray.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.629
All right.
Did you have red hair as a child?

16:43.399 --> 16:46.091
I thought I saw a touch
of russet in your hair.

16:46.398 --> 16:48.488
It was probably ketchup from lunch.

16:51.295 --> 16:54.488
Zeidenberg's going to a lecture series
in Detroit next week.

16:54.695 --> 16:56.320
You want to cover for him?

16:56.927 --> 16:57.914
Sure.

16:58.127 --> 17:02.081
You have to take over the scheduling,
risk management, shift reports...

17:02.292 --> 17:06.586
No problem. It'll be good training for
when I'm chief surgical resident.

17:06.857 --> 17:10.788
That's what I like about you,
naked ambition tempered by arrogance.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.852
You have an emergency call.
Your brother-in-law.

17:14.055 --> 17:17.416
- I'm scrubbing in for surgery.
- He said your mother's missing.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.141
Go. I'll get Schneider to scrub in.

17:21.718 --> 17:23.910
Peter, go. It's your mother.

17:24.117 --> 17:27.878
Okay, I'll be back this afternoon
in time for the pheo.

17:32.415 --> 17:33.402
Hold on.

17:34.047 --> 17:38.240
Dr. Lewis, you took care of
Miss Callahan, who went up to OB, right?

17:38.479 --> 17:40.445
Dr. Bernardi, upstairs, for you.

17:41.078 --> 17:42.737
Her chart still around?

17:43.777 --> 17:45.333
This is Dr. Lewis.

17:45.543 --> 17:48.133
Yeah. We gave her...

17:49.142 --> 17:52.664
...magnesium sulfate, a six-gram bolus.

17:52.974 --> 17:54.962
Right before we sent her to you.

17:56.573 --> 17:58.061
Yeah, no problem.

17:58.272 --> 18:01.703
Hey, Timmy. Any idea why Mark
signed this chart?

18:13.300 --> 18:15.663
- Where's Greene?
- Exam Room 4.

18:20.631 --> 18:22.926
There must be at least
100 of them in there.

18:23.130 --> 18:25.118
- Are they moving along?
- Not really.

18:25.329 --> 18:29.021
- How long is this gonna take?
- You'll have to ask Jorge that.

18:29.361 --> 18:31.588
Why are you cosigning my charts?

18:32.460 --> 18:33.448
Excuse me.

18:33.660 --> 18:37.556
- My charts have your signature. Why?
- Morgenstern told me to.

18:37.758 --> 18:40.587
You think you need
to oversee my decisions?

18:40.790 --> 18:42.687
- No.
- You tell Morgenstern that?

18:42.889 --> 18:46.752
- He didn't ask my opinion.
- Why didn't you stand up for me?

18:46.955 --> 18:49.818
You seem to forget a patient died.
Your patient.

18:50.053 --> 18:52.780
It could've happened to any of us,
but it happened to you.

18:52.986 --> 18:55.474
And now there's a lawsuit
and an inquiry.

18:55.685 --> 18:58.582
And because I'm chief resident,
it's my problem too.

18:58.784 --> 19:03.238
So if Morgenstern wants me to cosign
your charts, I'm gonna do it.

19:04.182 --> 19:07.170
You knew what he was gonna
say to me today, didn't you?

19:09.513 --> 19:10.944
- Yes.
- You talked about me.

19:11.146 --> 19:13.940
I talk with Morgenstern
about every resident.

19:14.145 --> 19:16.837
- What'd you say?
- That Kayson gives you a hard time.

19:17.044 --> 19:20.032
And the way he rides you,
it's no wonder this happened.

19:20.242 --> 19:23.503
And when you go head-to-head with
guys like Benton and Kayson...

19:23.709 --> 19:25.299
...you tend to back down.

19:28.373 --> 19:30.464
Son of a bitch.

19:41.502 --> 19:43.490
Hey, Ben. How are you?

19:49.232 --> 19:50.220
I got it.

20:01.995 --> 20:03.392
Dr. Ross.

20:03.595 --> 20:05.560
Hey, Wendy, look who's up.

20:05.760 --> 20:08.089
O-2 sat's falling.
Get him on a ventilator.

20:08.292 --> 20:09.951
You better look at this.

20:13.757 --> 20:15.245
"Do not resuscitate"?

20:15.890 --> 20:17.253
His father did this?

20:31.784 --> 20:36.340
Wendy, give Mr. Menkens
350 milligrams a minute of dopamine.

20:36.949 --> 20:38.642
I think you mean micrograms.

20:38.848 --> 20:41.040
- That's what I said, isn't it?
- No.

20:46.179 --> 20:49.406
- Have Ubaldo's T cells come back?
- No. Lab's backed up.

20:49.611 --> 20:52.236
Get this little smidge
out of my face.

20:52.443 --> 20:54.568
- What's wrong with him?
- Who cares?

20:54.776 --> 20:57.435
- Carol, can you get a chart going?
- Sure.

20:57.641 --> 21:00.163
- What did you do?
- Questioned her sexual orientation.

21:00.374 --> 21:01.566
Well, that's rude.

21:01.774 --> 21:04.500
- No malice intended.
- Did she do this?

21:04.706 --> 21:07.103
- Newsstand guy.
- What'd you say to him?

21:07.305 --> 21:10.668
Derogatory comments about his heritage.
Didn't take much.

21:10.836 --> 21:14.029
- Injuries anywhere else?
- Think I've got a cracked rib.

21:14.202 --> 21:15.190
Newsstand guy?

21:15.402 --> 21:18.231
Florist in Wicker Park,
sensitive about his hairweave.

21:18.434 --> 21:21.228
Malik, give me a hand.
Take him to the Suture Room.

21:21.433 --> 21:25.364
What do you do? Go around insulting
people until they hit you?

21:25.731 --> 21:29.163
I'm a sociologist at Chicago,
specializing in violence.

21:29.363 --> 21:32.522
I select a subject, ask two questions
to probe for insecurities...

21:32.729 --> 21:35.819
...then I antagonize them
until they assault me.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.186
- Sounds dangerous.
- Tell me about it.

21:38.394 --> 21:42.052
My insurance company charges me the
same premiums as NASCAR drivers.

21:52.822 --> 21:56.616
We'll move him to Intensive Care soon.
I see you made a decision.

21:57.987 --> 22:00.508
Mr. Gaither, Ben's blood
gases are not good.

22:00.719 --> 22:02.547
He's not getting enough oxygen.

22:03.152 --> 22:05.117
If he's not ventilated,
he could die.

22:06.917 --> 22:07.905
When?

22:09.050 --> 22:10.742
It could be a matter of hours.

22:13.115 --> 22:14.705
With the proper care...

22:15.180 --> 22:17.304
...he could live a long time.

22:18.946 --> 22:20.775
Are you sure...

22:20.978 --> 22:22.705
...that you want to give up?

22:38.373 --> 22:40.099
I can't believe Mrs. Lukey.

22:40.305 --> 22:43.168
She's too senile to do the job.

22:43.371 --> 22:46.200
Myatt's kid may have seen
your mom down at the corner.

22:46.403 --> 22:49.799
- She waited two hours to call us.
- Not us. Me.

22:50.002 --> 22:52.694
- She made me look like an idiot...
- Look, Peter.

22:52.901 --> 22:55.196
I left a station full of
cars that need service.

22:55.400 --> 22:59.195
All because you had to hire some
old woman to take care of your mom...

22:59.398 --> 23:02.057
...instead of putting her in a home.
- She's not doing that.

23:02.264 --> 23:05.956
- Like hell she isn't.
- Walt, don't tell me what to do.

23:06.263 --> 23:09.092
I won't let you put us
through this anymore.

23:09.295 --> 23:11.816
I'm sorry if it makes you sad,
but there's no choice.

23:12.027 --> 23:13.822
She's my mother.
Who are you to tell me...

23:14.026 --> 23:18.355
I paid for her food, her clothes
and her care for the last six years.

23:18.558 --> 23:20.387
She lets you live in her house.

23:20.590 --> 23:23.851
Who pays the damn mortgage?
Who pays the bills?

23:24.056 --> 23:26.078
You don't get anything out of it?

23:26.289 --> 23:28.311
How many high-school
dropouts do you know...

23:28.522 --> 23:31.748
...have a $ 100,000 business
just dropped in their laps?

23:32.486 --> 23:33.951
High-school dropout?

23:35.119 --> 23:38.050
I cared for your family for six years.

23:38.317 --> 23:40.874
I carried your family for six years.

23:42.083 --> 23:46.310
I'm responsible for your mother, your
sister, the house and the station.

23:46.515 --> 23:50.310
The only one that Peter
is responsible for is Peter.

23:51.447 --> 23:53.469
I'm gonna look by the firehouse.

23:56.844 --> 24:00.570
Okay, Mr. Desmond, I'm going to
clean your abrasions.

24:01.443 --> 24:03.431
We'll start with your wrist.

24:03.642 --> 24:05.198
It may sting a little.

24:05.774 --> 24:08.603
- That's a big engagement ring.
- Isn't it?

24:08.807 --> 24:10.931
Kind of ostentatious,
don't you think?

24:11.206 --> 24:12.194
No, I don't.

24:12.405 --> 24:13.734
Can I ask you two questions?

24:14.272 --> 24:15.294
All right.

24:15.538 --> 24:16.526
Excuse me.

24:17.837 --> 24:20.064
- What does your fiancé do?
- He's a doctor.

24:20.270 --> 24:23.428
So, gonna be a doctor's wife.
When's the date?

24:23.969 --> 24:25.957
We haven't set one yet.

24:26.134 --> 24:27.121
Why not?

24:27.867 --> 24:29.594
Your two questions are up.

24:30.333 --> 24:32.957
What's the matter?
Somebody can't commit?

24:33.165 --> 24:36.721
Based on the ring, I don't think
it's him. So what is it?

24:37.597 --> 24:39.153
Think you're too good for him?

24:39.363 --> 24:43.555
Scared of spending your life with
someone who doesn't meet your standards?

24:43.862 --> 24:45.724
Got a high opinion of yourself,
don't you?

24:45.927 --> 24:49.790
"Sure, I'll marry you.
Just don't tie me down to a date."

24:49.959 --> 24:50.982
That stings!

24:51.192 --> 24:52.850
- Really?
- Yes, it does.

24:53.824 --> 24:54.881
God!

24:55.090 --> 24:57.521
Twenty-one second PAI...

24:57.723 --> 25:00.654
...puts you in the top percentile
on the hostility index.

25:01.222 --> 25:04.846
- PAI is?
- Provocation-to-assault interval.

25:05.653 --> 25:06.777
You're good.

25:07.786 --> 25:08.843
God, you're good.

25:11.284 --> 25:12.272
John, what's this?

25:12.485 --> 25:13.950
It's a laryngoscope.

25:14.450 --> 25:16.245
No, no.
Second shelf from the top.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.942
- Can you teach me how these work?
- Some other time.

25:21.415 --> 25:23.505
We need this crash cart in Four.

25:23.813 --> 25:26.040
Body packer popped a condom.

25:26.246 --> 25:27.541
Got it? Let's go.

25:32.610 --> 25:34.973
- Give me some room, huh?
- There you go.

25:35.909 --> 25:38.874
- Try not to get in the way.
- Can't you pull out the coke?

25:39.075 --> 25:40.869
We gotta stabilize him first.

25:41.074 --> 25:45.505
- He's having multifocal PVCs.
- Lidocaine 150, IV push.

25:45.905 --> 25:47.370
He's in fib. Paddles.

25:48.039 --> 25:49.163
Oh, my God!

25:51.571 --> 25:53.399
- What was that set on?
- 200.

25:53.603 --> 25:55.364
He should be okay.

25:57.101 --> 25:59.828
Thank you. Why don't you
check on him, okay?

26:00.000 --> 26:00.988
Clear.

26:02.333 --> 26:05.594
That's not good. Let's go again.
Three hundred.

26:06.998 --> 26:08.054
Clear.

26:09.931 --> 26:11.521
Normal sinus.
Take him upstairs.

26:11.729 --> 26:15.990
Notify the O.R. They got a laparotomy.
We gotta get these condoms out.

26:17.261 --> 26:20.021
Don't worry, honey.
He just bumped his head.

26:22.626 --> 26:26.182
Alan, the guy with the colors?
His films came back.

26:26.392 --> 26:28.822
Radiology had a bunch
from a few years ago too.

26:30.956 --> 26:31.979
Susan?

26:41.319 --> 26:43.409
I can stay in this room all day.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.680
It's warm, like flannel.

26:46.018 --> 26:47.347
I wish I could wear it.

26:47.917 --> 26:51.541
When you gave me your history,
you didn't say you had cancer.

26:51.749 --> 26:54.237
What's nice about this room is that...

26:55.247 --> 26:57.712
...it's not too bright.

26:59.879 --> 27:01.969
When yellow's too bright,
it's not welcoming.

27:02.179 --> 27:05.042
Alan, you have a tumor
in your chest...

27:05.278 --> 27:08.175
...encasing your heart
and infiltrating your lungs.

27:08.410 --> 27:09.875
On the other hand...

27:10.409 --> 27:14.170
...if yellow's too pale,
it feels cold and clammy.

27:15.008 --> 27:18.063
There are treatments:
Chemotherapy, radiation...

27:18.273 --> 27:20.704
Dr. Lewis and I think you
should see an oncologist.

27:20.906 --> 27:22.201
I'll tell you one thing:

27:22.471 --> 27:24.993
Whoever made this room
sure knew his yellow.

27:32.701 --> 27:34.132
Could I be alone, please?

27:34.400 --> 27:35.388
Sure.

27:59.992 --> 28:00.979
Ma?

28:02.357 --> 28:04.515
Ma, what are you doing up here?

28:04.723 --> 28:06.348
Who is that?

28:07.822 --> 28:09.980
- Peter?
- Yeah, Ma, it's me.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.744
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

28:13.420 --> 28:16.317
Ma, I work at a hospital, remember?

28:16.485 --> 28:17.473
I'm a doctor.

28:18.085 --> 28:19.380
I know that.

28:22.250 --> 28:26.045
Why do I feel I don't
get a chance to see you?

28:27.648 --> 28:30.045
Well, because they keep
us pretty busy.

28:31.247 --> 28:33.439
But we see each other sometimes.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.072
So serious.

28:37.278 --> 28:41.732
I remember you sitting
in that green chair by the window...

28:41.943 --> 28:43.408
...reading your books.

28:43.609 --> 28:45.870
So serious.

28:51.973 --> 28:53.598
You know, Ma...

28:57.570 --> 29:00.797
...with Jackie at work all day
and the kids at school...

29:02.136 --> 29:04.102
...we worry about you being alone.

29:04.668 --> 29:08.121
Oh, I don't like it that way either.
I like a full house.

29:08.334 --> 29:10.890
Well, that's why we were thinking...

29:11.599 --> 29:15.621
...maybe you'd be happier in a place
where, you know, there's...

29:16.431 --> 29:20.691
Where there's other people your age,
people that can take care of you.

29:21.496 --> 29:26.189
I used to bring Jackie
to take skating lessons right here.

29:26.761 --> 29:28.623
And your father and I...

29:28.826 --> 29:31.848
...watched you in
the Little League...

29:32.059 --> 29:33.615
...right on this field.

29:34.158 --> 29:35.248
Remember?

29:35.557 --> 29:36.783
Yeah, I remember.

29:40.056 --> 29:41.816
Your father's dead.

29:44.820 --> 29:45.808
Yeah.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.711
Yeah. He's dead, Ma.

29:51.618 --> 29:52.606
Peter...

29:58.815 --> 30:02.144
...I don't want to go
into a nursing home.

30:09.212 --> 30:10.371
All right.

30:16.476 --> 30:18.964
It's all right, Ma.
It's all right.

30:21.774 --> 30:26.137
Spin a crit, type and cross-match
4 units. Get some O-negative here.

30:26.339 --> 30:29.202
- Man, you gotta do something.
- Out of the way.

30:29.572 --> 30:30.730
Out of the way!

30:31.138 --> 30:33.500
Stay here.
We're gonna take care of her.

30:34.269 --> 30:36.700
- BP's 40 palp.
- Someone call a surgeon.

30:36.902 --> 30:38.594
I see the entrance.
Who sees the exit?

30:38.801 --> 30:40.993
- Here, on her back.
- It was a drive-by.

30:41.201 --> 30:43.927
- She was a bystander.
- Her brother's a banger.

30:44.166 --> 30:45.722
- Look at his clothes.
- What do we got?

30:45.933 --> 30:47.659
Gunshot to the chest.
Through and through.

30:47.865 --> 30:49.989
She's hyperresonant.
Tracheal shift left.

30:50.198 --> 30:52.186
- She needs a chest tube.
- I'll do it.

30:55.529 --> 30:58.516
Heart sounds funky.
Get a cardiologist down here.

31:00.594 --> 31:03.218
- Damn it. Where's this coming from?
- Pressure's crashing.

31:03.426 --> 31:05.482
- She's taching.
- Bullet tumbled into the heart.

31:05.692 --> 31:08.156
- Let's crack her, clamp the bleeder.
- Thoracotomy tray.

31:08.358 --> 31:09.517
I'll do it.

31:10.423 --> 31:12.048
- What's the problem?
- We have a bleeder.

31:12.390 --> 31:13.480
It sounded like a murmur.

31:13.689 --> 31:16.052
- Open her quick.
- Give her O-neg, wide open.

31:19.220 --> 31:22.617
Damn it! I need suction.
I can't visualize the lungs.

31:25.019 --> 31:27.245
- How about now?
- I can't see the pleura.

31:27.451 --> 31:29.178
Her cut's not deep enough.

31:29.384 --> 31:30.371
Susan?

31:31.149 --> 31:33.909
Yes, it's deep enough.
I just can't see anything.

31:34.115 --> 31:35.808
Calm down, you'll get it.

31:37.114 --> 31:38.102
She's bleeding out.

31:41.312 --> 31:44.073
- How long will you let her do this?
- More suction.

31:44.278 --> 31:45.903
- We're losing her!
- She can't do it.

31:50.443 --> 31:52.238
Damn it! I can't see!
You try.

31:54.574 --> 31:55.562
Scalpel.

31:59.039 --> 32:00.300
Okay, I'm in.

32:04.638 --> 32:07.432
I see the bleeder.
Pulmonary artery. Clamp.

32:07.704 --> 32:08.691
No, Stadinsky.

32:15.933 --> 32:17.592
Got it.
Let's get her to O.R.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.197
Good job, Dr. Greene.

32:21.765 --> 32:22.957
Okay. Let's go.

32:48.289 --> 32:50.345
We've got a possible
appendectomy in 6.

32:50.555 --> 32:53.281
See who else is on.
I'm late for a pheo.

32:58.452 --> 33:00.111
- You got his picture?
- It's there.

33:00.318 --> 33:01.806
- The metronome?
- It's there.

33:02.017 --> 33:05.413
- We can take it from here.
- It's okay. I'll take him up.

33:12.514 --> 33:14.502
I didn't know you had a son.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.936
Well, we're not exactly close.

33:17.911 --> 33:19.275
What's his name?

33:19.577 --> 33:21.701
I don't know. Never seen him.
Here we go.

33:23.076 --> 33:24.201
Watch yourself.

33:28.708 --> 33:30.798
- The DNR sticker's on there.
- Thanks.

33:57.431 --> 34:00.555
Are we doing an anterior approach
or excising laterally?

34:00.763 --> 34:05.126
Peter, there's no need to scrub in.
I asked Schneider to assist.

34:05.328 --> 34:06.816
Hey, Peter.
How's it going?

34:07.028 --> 34:09.050
Did you take the Eisenhower in?

34:09.260 --> 34:11.554
Ever notice that piano showroom
near Halsted?

34:11.759 --> 34:15.156
- I got my wife's harpsichord there.
- Wait. You've been inside?

34:15.358 --> 34:18.152
They have a Steinway collection
that'll knock your socks off.

34:18.356 --> 34:19.911
When did you notice this place?

34:20.123 --> 34:21.985
- About two years.
- Two years ago?

34:39.882 --> 34:41.007
Where is he?

34:41.547 --> 34:43.775
We took Ben up to Intensive Care.

34:45.713 --> 34:46.871
Intensive Care.

34:47.079 --> 34:49.045
They're aware of your decision.
You okay?

34:49.213 --> 34:50.199
Yeah.

34:51.978 --> 34:55.875
I just got offered a job managing
a recycling plant in Detroit.

34:56.510 --> 34:58.236
I gotta pick up and move.

35:06.207 --> 35:08.865
Coming back, I just couldn't
help thinking...

35:09.438 --> 35:12.198
...how much easier it would be
if Ben were dead.

35:16.969 --> 35:19.161
What kind of a man thinks like that?

35:21.900 --> 35:25.626
What kind of a father prays
for his own boy to die?

35:29.099 --> 35:32.927
For two years, it's been
just me and Ben.

35:33.130 --> 35:34.459
Been no work.

35:34.963 --> 35:36.326
No friends.

35:37.428 --> 35:38.587
Nobody.

35:40.061 --> 35:42.548
He needs me 24 hours a day...

35:42.860 --> 35:44.086
...to turn him...

35:44.293 --> 35:45.849
...and feed him...

35:48.825 --> 35:51.222
...and sing to him when he cries.

35:58.654 --> 36:00.313
I love my boy.

36:05.652 --> 36:07.708
I've given Ben two years.

36:09.618 --> 36:11.310
Two years.

36:15.848 --> 36:18.336
I just can't give anymore.

36:22.713 --> 36:25.507
I need for this to end.

36:25.911 --> 36:28.433
I need for this to end.

36:30.876 --> 36:32.398
Dear God!

36:50.070 --> 36:51.694
Well, well. Look who's back.

36:51.902 --> 36:52.925
My head.

36:53.135 --> 36:56.657
You took quite a fall. But don't worry,
Deb's been caring for you.

36:56.866 --> 36:59.127
She worked you up real good.

37:04.631 --> 37:08.153
"Blood pressure, 90 over 60.
Respiration..."

37:08.363 --> 37:10.294
"Guaiac negative stool"!
You gave me a rectal?

37:10.495 --> 37:12.222
Haleh thought it would be
good practice.

37:12.428 --> 37:13.758
Good practice?
Good practice!

37:13.961 --> 37:16.586
Settle down.
She has to learn, doesn't she?

37:16.793 --> 37:18.157
Oh, Deb, another thing.

37:18.359 --> 37:21.620
The proper term isn't
"average male genitalia."

37:21.825 --> 37:24.312
- It's "normal male genitalia."
- What?

37:24.524 --> 37:26.183
Where does it say that?

37:28.956 --> 37:30.853
Oh, you guys are just kidding.

37:31.888 --> 37:33.285
So you didn't.

37:34.087 --> 37:35.075
You didn't.

37:35.953 --> 37:37.646
Told you we'd get him.

37:43.117 --> 37:45.673
Do you know where you are,
Mr. Parnell?

37:45.883 --> 37:49.644
In the chump cellar.
Three knockout losses in a row.

37:49.848 --> 37:50.904
Damn!

37:51.681 --> 37:53.976
And I had him against the ropes too.

37:54.613 --> 37:57.135
I stepped into that cross.

37:58.745 --> 38:01.471
Thought you might like
some company, Mr. Desmond.

38:02.743 --> 38:04.106
This is Mr. Parnell.

38:04.310 --> 38:05.605
Hello.

38:06.908 --> 38:08.703
What happened to you?

38:09.441 --> 38:11.599
Don't want to talk about it.

38:14.606 --> 38:16.730
Can I ask you two questions?

38:31.600 --> 38:33.963
I should've warned you
about Morgenstern.

38:34.532 --> 38:38.293
And I should've been more up-front
about the cosigning business.

38:42.596 --> 38:44.494
I didn't know how to tell you.

38:49.594 --> 38:52.491
No one could've done that
thoracotomy under the circumstances.

38:52.692 --> 38:56.180
With Kayson breathing down your neck,
and the hearing next week...

38:56.391 --> 38:58.652
Are you trying to make me feel better?

39:01.456 --> 39:03.353
I'm trying to apologize.

39:03.988 --> 39:06.044
So you can feel better yourself?

39:12.718 --> 39:15.945
Some of us are going
to Doc Magoo's after work.

39:16.851 --> 39:18.282
If you want to come...

39:44.141 --> 39:45.231
Alan?

39:50.539 --> 39:54.095
My buddy Max moved out of the home
last summer, got an apartment.

39:54.304 --> 39:56.235
Been trying to get me
to split the rent.

39:56.436 --> 39:58.958
The problem is the bathroom.

40:00.002 --> 40:01.558
Celadon green.

40:02.201 --> 40:04.030
I asked him to re-tile.

40:04.767 --> 40:06.891
Now I'm thinking...

40:07.232 --> 40:08.528
..."What the hell?"

40:09.199 --> 40:12.254
Sometimes you gotta take
the plunge, you know?

40:14.997 --> 40:17.553
Well, you don't want to
forget your book.

40:18.629 --> 40:20.094
There's a section missing.

40:21.761 --> 40:23.385
Guess which color.

40:25.260 --> 40:26.350
Green.

40:29.125 --> 40:31.749
- Lydia, you going to Magoo's?
- In a few minutes.

40:31.957 --> 40:34.649
- Anyone seen Carol?
- She's upstairs. I'll let her know.

40:34.856 --> 40:37.446
Try and see if you can
get Susan to come.

40:37.722 --> 40:39.347
What a day.

40:43.653 --> 40:45.380
That answers your two questions!

40:45.685 --> 40:49.707
Lydia, somebody should probably
check on Mr. Desmond.

40:56.349 --> 40:59.472
It's soaked in 100-proof alcohol.
It's totally sterile.

40:59.680 --> 41:01.770
I'm not drinking anything
with a worm in it.

41:01.980 --> 41:05.467
- Who's got the tequila?
- Give me your glass, Dr. Ross.

41:06.844 --> 41:09.036
Wait. The curly fries are mine.

41:09.611 --> 41:11.667
You have to sit at the counter
with her.

41:12.009 --> 41:14.338
Hey, I'm not kidding.
Sit at the counter.

41:14.542 --> 41:16.973
They just announced the
$40-million jackpot...

41:17.174 --> 41:19.435
...went to a dry cleaner in Winnetka.

41:19.640 --> 41:22.197
Oh, man! And I was counting
on that money too.

41:22.405 --> 41:24.303
You didn't even kick in.

41:24.738 --> 41:28.135
- You hear about Carter's electroshock?
- Sorry I missed it.

41:28.337 --> 41:30.529
Guess how many condoms
this guy had in his belly.

41:30.736 --> 41:32.894
- 150?
- 185.

41:33.102 --> 41:34.533
And he lived?

41:35.268 --> 41:38.427
Hey, B! I got your double burger,
double cheese here.

41:38.633 --> 41:40.962
Keep your lard-burgers to yourself.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.892
Everybody, listen.
Carol has an announcement.

41:44.098 --> 41:46.756
It's no big deal.
Just keep May 18th open.

41:46.964 --> 41:49.225
That's when Tag and I
are getting married.

41:54.961 --> 41:57.085
- Susan coming?
- Couldn't find her.

41:57.893 --> 41:59.381
- What's this?
- Lotto ticket.

41:59.593 --> 42:01.149
- How's your mother?
- Fine.

42:01.792 --> 42:03.382
How was your rectal?

42:04.357 --> 42:05.721
Hey, I won ten bucks!

42:05.923 --> 42:07.320
Great. Pick up the check.

42:07.523 --> 42:09.784
- What are the odds?
- How can you tell?

42:09.989 --> 42:11.420
Just flip it over.

42:11.622 --> 42:13.416
Let me get a fruit plate.

42:13.621 --> 42:17.382
Let's see, ten-dollar win,
one in 250. Sounds familiar.

42:17.587 --> 42:20.381
Don't think about it.
What are the odds you'll win $ 10...

42:20.585 --> 42:23.016
...set a wedding date and get HIV
on the same day?

42:23.184 --> 42:24.274
You got yogurt?

42:25.083 --> 42:26.344
A bran muffin?

42:27.783 --> 42:30.112
Hey, everyone,
I want to propose a toast.

42:32.848 --> 42:34.006
To Carol.

42:35.947 --> 42:39.105
May your upcoming marriage
bring you laughter...

42:39.312 --> 42:41.436
...and happiness and kids...

42:41.644 --> 42:43.041
...and most of all, love.

42:43.244 --> 42:45.868
God knows you deserve
all of those things.

42:46.176 --> 42:47.300
Hear! Hear!

42:49.608 --> 42:50.868
Congratulations, girl.

42:51.540 --> 42:52.665
To Carol!

42:54.906 --> 42:56.303
About time, Hathaway.

42:56.506 --> 42:58.028
Where's the stripper?

43:00.571 --> 43:01.628
I had a May wedding.

43:02.603 --> 43:04.398
What month did you divorce?

43:05.169 --> 43:07.361
Hey, B, looks like
you put on some weight.

43:07.569 --> 43:09.466
When you say that, smile, brother.

43:09.668 --> 43:11.599
I think you're right, Timmy.

43:11.800 --> 43:15.595
- Rudy and I also have an announcement.
- We got married last week.
