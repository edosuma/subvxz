00:06.058 --> 00:08.326
There is so much to talk about.

00:08.394 --> 00:09.861
Philip and Elizabeth's lives.

00:09.928 --> 00:12.220
Not the other ones...
those should never be discussed.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.732

00:16.857 --> 00:19.424

documents from the Rezidentura.

00:27.231 --> 00:29.866
you reported several times
over the years about Philip.

00:29.935 --> 00:31.336
Can we trust him?

00:31.404 --> 00:32.971
I'm not a spy.

00:35.642 --> 00:37.343
We'll die before we'll talk.

00:37.411 --> 00:39.413
I'm sorry. We had to
know if you were the mole,

00:39.481 --> 00:41.081
if we could... Trust you.

00:41.149 --> 00:44.518
I'm gonna kill you,
you stupid bitch!

00:44.585 --> 00:46.053
Tell whoever approved this

00:46.087 --> 00:49.056
that your face is a present
from me to them!

00:49.123 --> 00:50.891
You told them
I considered defecting.

00:50.958 --> 00:52.492
That's why this is happening.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.059
What did you tell them?

00:54.127 --> 00:57.081
I told them that
you liked it here too much.

00:59.308 --> 01:01.448
<i>Thousands of
protesters are demonstrating</i>

01:01.573 --> 01:02.700

01:02.768 --> 01:04.035
Why not?

01:04.102 --> 01:05.737
You do not need
more leg warmers, Paige.

01:05.804 --> 01:06.871
Henry.

01:06.940 --> 01:08.508
People in China are starving,

01:08.575 --> 01:10.878
but if Paige gets leg warmers,
it's gonna start a famine.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.780
- Paige, you have 16 pairs.
- That's a gross exaggeration!

01:12.848 --> 01:14.783
Henry, what are you doing?
Get over here and eat, please.

01:14.850 --> 01:16.585

Talk about what... the fact
that our own people tortured us

01:57.301 --> 01:58.501
because they don't trust us

01:58.569 --> 01:59.869

02:05.676 --> 02:07.077
I'll be at The Carnegie Hotel.

02:07.145 --> 02:08.645
Yeah, have a good time.

straight to the point.

06:48.457 --> 06:50.258
A friend of Adam Dorwin,

for the past year and a half.

06:53.128 --> 06:54.395
Adam's dead.

06:54.463 --> 06:56.431

We had to eliminate him.

06:57.165 --> 06:58.099
<i>You</i> killed him?

06:58.167 --> 07:00.034
I was very fond of Adam.

07:00.102 --> 07:01.803
I can't say the same

07:01.870 --> 07:03.104
since we've only just met,

07:03.139 --> 07:04.973

Not really.

07:44.014 --> 07:45.481
Well,
you're missing the boat, Phil.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.316

07:56.526 --> 07:58.660
We're both riding
the revolutionary soul train...

07:58.728 --> 08:01.129
- Faneuil hall, Paul Revere's ride.
- Right.

08:01.197 --> 08:03.498
The white house,
the Jefferson memorial,

08:03.566 --> 08:05.000

Phil.

08:58.691 --> 09:00.191
So have I.

09:05.497 --> 09:07.298
Bonjour, Montreal.

09:20.145 --> 09:21.478
You think I owe you an apology.

09:21.546 --> 09:23.281
I think you owe me
more than an apology.

09:25.551 --> 09:27.952
We had to find the mole.
You know the drill.

09:28.020 --> 09:30.888
I was following orders,
dear, same as you.

09:32.024 --> 09:33.558
Nevertheless, I'm sorry.

09:43.035 --> 09:44.936
I'm sorry I didn't kill you.

09:45.003 --> 09:46.838
That's my apology.

09:50.136 --> 09:51.743
Better luck next time.

10:06.814 --> 10:09.359
Bad things happen,
not only in literature.

10:09.427 --> 10:10.827
Is that a threat?

10:10.895 --> 10:14.197
Only if you're serious
about killing me, Nadezhda.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.265
Don't call me that.

10:15.332 --> 10:16.499
It upsets you?

10:16.567 --> 10:18.535
It confuses me.

10:18.603 --> 10:22.039
I like to keep my wits
when I'm handling snakes.

10:24.342 --> 10:27.510
Very well, <i>Elizabeth.</i>

10:27.578 --> 10:30.280
Did you meet Prince?

10:30.348 --> 10:31.881
I did. And?

10:31.949 --> 10:33.449
He's a degenerate gambler.

10:33.517 --> 10:35.952
We all have our issues.

10:36.020 --> 10:39.189
He's gonna lose his kneecaps
or worse.

10:39.257 --> 10:40.223
How much?

10:40.291 --> 10:41.591
20 grand.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.989

11:04.372 --> 11:06.183

11:06.717 --> 11:11.045

_

11:17.355 --> 11:18.786
_

11:41.786 --> 11:43.521
So if Bielawski's
such a critical threat,

11:43.588 --> 11:45.356
why doesn't the Soviet union
just kill him?

11:46.358 --> 11:47.958
It's a catch-22.

11:48.026 --> 11:50.361
Bielawski's the fuse that
ignites the Polish street.

11:50.429 --> 11:52.696
Without him, the forces
that are gaining momentum

11:52.764 --> 11:55.867
to fight for Polish independence
from moscow wither and die,

11:55.934 --> 11:57.535
but Bielawski has to live

11:57.603 --> 12:00.372
to maintain the fiction
of Polish independence.

12:04.377 --> 12:05.610
You're as handsome as ever.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.948
You, as well.

12:10.916 --> 12:13.785
Your life in America...
is it a full life?

12:15.855 --> 12:16.888
Yes.

12:18.157 --> 12:19.257
You're married.

12:19.325 --> 12:20.925
Yes.

12:20.993 --> 12:22.160
Children?

12:22.227 --> 12:23.761
Two... a boy and a girl.

12:23.829 --> 12:24.796
You?

12:24.863 --> 12:26.230
I was married.

12:26.298 --> 12:27.265
Divorced?

12:27.332 --> 12:28.633
He died.

12:30.168 --> 12:31.269
Children?

12:31.336 --> 12:33.070
Yes...

12:33.138 --> 12:34.172
A son.

12:36.741 --> 12:38.575
Thank you.

12:42.013 --> 12:43.414
I have to go.

12:47.685 --> 12:48.985
Good luck.

12:49.053 --> 12:51.120
And to you.

13:03.759 --> 13:05.393
Oh, hi! Hi! Come in. Come in.

13:05.461 --> 13:08.063
We brought dessert. Oh, thank you!
It's beautiful.

13:08.130 --> 13:10.498
Is it... blackout cake...
Stan's favorite. Good.

13:10.566 --> 13:11.766
Did you bake it yourself?

13:11.834 --> 13:13.434
I bought it
with my own two hands.

13:14.937 --> 13:16.404
So when does Philip get home?

13:16.472 --> 13:18.039
Um, tomorrow.

13:18.107 --> 13:19.207
Can I watch TV?

13:19.274 --> 13:20.541
Yeah, no, of course.

13:20.609 --> 13:23.077
Um, I also have Foosball
in the basement.

13:23.111 --> 13:25.179
Cool! Oh. Where's Matthew?

13:25.247 --> 13:28.583
Oh, he's actually upstairs
finishing his homework.

13:28.651 --> 13:30.718
You ready to lose to me
in a game of Foosball?

13:30.786 --> 13:33.121
Like that's ever gonna happen.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.724
Um, I hope you're not starving
because, you know, Stan said

13:35.791 --> 13:38.026
that he would be home
any minute, but, um...

13:38.094 --> 13:40.863
We're fine. We're fine.

13:42.031 --> 13:43.265
Sorry I'm late.

13:43.333 --> 13:44.933
Oh, not a problem, my dear.

13:46.436 --> 13:47.536
Andrzej.

13:47.604 --> 13:49.138
Anne.

13:51.508 --> 13:53.108
Virginia!

13:54.010 --> 13:55.277
I'm gonna buy you a drink.

13:55.345 --> 13:57.079
You know what? I have
a meeting with a client.

13:57.147 --> 13:58.547
One drink.

13:58.615 --> 14:01.050
Santa claus does not take no
for an answer.

14:01.118 --> 14:02.551
Why not?

14:03.720 --> 14:04.887
There you go.

14:09.659 --> 14:11.060
Uh, another bottle
of the Latour?

14:11.127 --> 14:13.461
No more, Charles, please.
I beg you, no more.

14:13.529 --> 14:15.330
No more.

14:15.398 --> 14:17.666
The priest doth protest
too much, methinks.

14:17.734 --> 14:19.601
I-I thought the two of you
should meet.

14:19.669 --> 14:21.636
I was born in Poland.

14:21.704 --> 14:23.105
Do you speak Polish?

14:24.707 --> 14:27.342
Well, I don't
understand a word-ski

14:27.410 --> 14:29.011
of the blood-ski language.

14:29.078 --> 14:32.014
Pardon me. There's a phone call
for you, Mr. Duluth.

14:32.082 --> 14:34.350
Save the juicy stuff
for when I get back,

14:34.417 --> 14:35.651
and some of the Latour.

14:35.719 --> 14:37.553
It costs a bloody fortune.

14:41.658 --> 14:42.926
What took you so long?

14:44.729 --> 14:45.829
I got distracted.

14:45.897 --> 14:47.464
Yeah, you and Andrzej both.

14:47.532 --> 14:48.498
How's it going?

14:48.566 --> 14:49.800
She's got him dangling

14:49.834 --> 14:51.468
from the tip
of her lovely little finger.

14:53.705 --> 14:54.805
And you?

14:54.872 --> 14:57.173
I don't make vows I can't keep.

14:59.343 --> 15:02.011
Yeah, I will do that.

15:02.079 --> 15:04.447
I have to leave...
an emergency at work.

15:04.515 --> 15:06.048
No, no, no.
Please, please, sit.

15:06.116 --> 15:07.950
Finish your dinner.
Finish the Latour.

15:08.018 --> 15:09.352
I insist.

15:10.254 --> 15:11.387
Bye, Charles.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.061
Hello?

15:19.129 --> 15:20.362
It's dad!

15:20.430 --> 15:23.032
I'm coming.

15:25.702 --> 15:27.570
Hey.

15:27.637 --> 15:30.539
Um, I'm not gonna be able
to make dinner tonight.

15:31.541 --> 15:32.808
Oh. I'm sorry.

15:32.876 --> 15:34.076
I'm just... Swamped.

15:34.144 --> 15:35.344
No, it's fine.

15:35.412 --> 15:36.812
I will leave something
on the stove

15:36.880 --> 15:37.880
for when you come home.

15:37.948 --> 15:40.216
Okay. Thanks.

15:47.157 --> 15:51.427
Stan apologizes and said
to start without him.

15:51.495 --> 15:53.262
What else is new?

15:53.330 --> 15:56.733
Matthew, your father is doing
some extremely important work.

15:56.801 --> 15:59.202
Mom, dad hasn't been home
for dinner in a week.

15:59.270 --> 16:00.904
The president
of the United States

16:00.972 --> 16:02.539
eats dinner with his family
occasionally.

16:02.607 --> 16:03.907
Is he more important
than the president?

16:03.975 --> 16:05.241
Matthew.

16:05.309 --> 16:07.944
Are you sure he still
even lives here, mom?

16:15.019 --> 16:16.720
In '38, they fled to Canada,

16:16.788 --> 16:20.190
where my father drove a taxi
and my mother cleaned houses,

16:20.258 --> 16:24.562
but they never, not for one day,
regretted leaving Poland.

16:24.629 --> 16:27.065
They were grateful
they made it out alive.

16:27.132 --> 16:28.600
Hmm.

16:28.667 --> 16:30.735
My journey was an internal one.

16:30.803 --> 16:33.538
I had a comfortable life. Yeah.

16:33.606 --> 16:35.941
I was celebrated
by the Russians...

16:36.008 --> 16:39.377
a hero...
had a wife, children...

16:39.445 --> 16:41.079
A mistress.

16:43.449 --> 16:44.883
And now?

16:44.951 --> 16:47.585
Oh, now I live a life
of faith and purpose.

16:47.653 --> 16:50.422
<i>When 19th-century</i>
<i>Polish patriots</i>

16:50.489 --> 16:52.257
<i>rose against</i>
<i>foreign oppressors,</i>

16:52.291 --> 16:56.394
<i>their rallying cry was,</i>
<i>"for our freedom and yours."</i>

16:56.462 --> 16:59.230
<i>Well, that motto still</i>
<i>rings true in our time.</i>

16:59.298 --> 17:02.634
<i>There is a spirit of solidarity</i>
<i>abroad in the world tonight</i>

17:02.702 --> 17:04.669
<i>that no physical force</i>
<i>can crush.</i>

17:04.737 --> 17:06.637
<i>It crosses national boundaries</i>

17:06.705 --> 17:09.473
<i>and enters into the hearts</i>
<i>of men and women everywhere.</i>

17:09.541 --> 17:11.343
<i>We, the people</i>
<i>of the free world,</i>

17:11.411 --> 17:14.813
<i>stand as one with our Polish</i>
<i>brothers and sisters.</i>

17:14.847 --> 17:17.782
Are you always accompanied
by chaperones?

17:17.851 --> 17:19.417
It's for my own protection.

17:19.486 --> 17:21.987
There are people who would
be happy to see me dead.

17:22.055 --> 17:23.321
I'll keep you safe.

17:24.891 --> 17:26.258
Excuse me, guys.

17:26.325 --> 17:28.292
Give me a break...
five minutes. Come on.

17:28.361 --> 17:30.362
All right.

17:31.364 --> 17:32.431
Where are you staying?

17:32.499 --> 17:33.599
The Carnegie Hotel.

17:33.667 --> 17:35.167
Me too!

17:35.235 --> 17:37.103
Oh, what a charming
coincidence.

17:37.170 --> 17:39.038
Or fate.

17:39.105 --> 17:40.339
Such a lovely evening,

17:40.407 --> 17:42.775
and I've had far too much
to drink,

17:42.843 --> 17:44.377
so I'll keep walking.

17:44.444 --> 17:45.544
It's not far.

17:45.612 --> 17:48.681
What's so funny?

17:48.749 --> 17:51.184
I've just... I've never been on
a date with a priest before.

17:51.252 --> 17:53.152
No! Aah! Give me the purse!
Give me the purse!

17:53.220 --> 17:55.488
Get off of me!

17:58.258 --> 17:59.659
Come back here!

17:59.693 --> 18:01.460
You go left.
I'll cut him off on the right.

18:05.232 --> 18:08.835
Over there! Hey!

18:12.206 --> 18:13.239
Are you all right?

18:13.307 --> 18:14.441
I think so.

18:14.475 --> 18:16.644
Your hand!

18:16.712 --> 18:19.213
West 59th street.

18:46.627 --> 18:47.860
Hey. I'm gonna hit the bar,

18:47.928 --> 18:49.495
see if I can
get into some trouble.

18:49.563 --> 18:50.863
Want to come?

18:50.931 --> 18:54.067
Um, I'm not a bar guy.
What's a bar guy?

18:54.135 --> 18:56.069
Someone who goes home
when the bars close.

18:56.137 --> 18:58.571
You know, I smell your farts
in the car, Stanley,

18:58.639 --> 19:00.006
and it ain't potpourri,

19:00.074 --> 19:03.142
so be a pal,
do your partner a solid,

19:03.210 --> 19:04.710
and let him buy you a drink.

19:04.778 --> 19:07.046
The Russkies will still be here
in the morning.

19:07.415 --> 19:10.017
One drink... One.

19:10.085 --> 19:11.686
Okay. You're a prince.

19:13.755 --> 19:16.157
You know, Stan... he works
really hard, <i>really</i> hard.

19:16.224 --> 19:18.892
He's doing very important work.

19:18.927 --> 19:21.962
Yeah, I know.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.164
I mean, he can't talk
about what he's doing.

19:24.232 --> 19:26.232
You know, it's
a national-security thing,

19:26.300 --> 19:27.867
but, I don't know, I just...

19:29.270 --> 19:31.404
I miss talking.

19:31.472 --> 19:34.473
I mean, I understand
the crazy hours,

19:34.541 --> 19:36.041
and national security...

19:36.109 --> 19:38.244
it's not like
you can just turn it on and off.

19:38.312 --> 19:40.379
Stan punches a clock,

19:40.447 --> 19:43.149
but the clock never stops
ticking, never.

19:44.485 --> 19:46.586
Marriage is hard.

19:46.653 --> 19:49.088
Well, it's not
for sissies, that is for sure.

19:50.758 --> 19:52.759
But at the end of the day,

19:52.827 --> 19:54.561
you just...

19:54.629 --> 19:57.063
Choose to keep going,
or you don't.

19:59.467 --> 20:01.201
You think it's that simple?

20:01.269 --> 20:03.937
Simple? No.

20:04.005 --> 20:06.273
I don't know, you know,
we've been married for 20 years.

20:06.340 --> 20:07.707
That's a lifetime.

20:07.775 --> 20:09.042
Mm.

20:09.109 --> 20:10.676
It's got to count
for something, right?

20:11.678 --> 20:12.745
Mm-hmm.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.515
You know, I envy you?

20:16.583 --> 20:18.383
You envy me? I do.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.020
I mean, I know you can't
judge a book by its cover,

20:21.088 --> 20:22.889
but you can judge a cover
by its cover,

20:22.957 --> 20:25.058
and you and Philip...
you just...

20:25.125 --> 20:28.895
you work together,
you're partners, you're a team.

20:30.264 --> 20:32.365
I just...

20:33.367 --> 20:35.501
don't think I could ever
see Stan and I doing that.

20:41.842 --> 20:42.975
Ah!

20:43.043 --> 20:44.444
Hurt? Just a bit.

20:47.114 --> 20:48.614
Oh, I-I got blood
on the bed sheet.

20:48.682 --> 20:50.449
I'm sorry.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.551
That's the beautiful thing
about hotels...

20:54.388 --> 20:55.821
housekeeping.

21:20.914 --> 21:22.215
_

21:30.793 --> 21:31.999
_

21:36.362 --> 21:37.880
_

21:40.933 --> 21:42.667
I want you,

21:42.735 --> 21:44.669
but I cannot have you.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.410
You're climbing
the ladder of success

21:53.445 --> 21:55.212
faster than
a rhesus monkey, Stan.

21:55.280 --> 21:56.814
What does that mean?

21:56.881 --> 21:58.549
It means I've been in C.I
for five years.

21:58.617 --> 22:00.151
You've been here, what,
a couple of months?

22:00.218 --> 22:01.619
Gaad looks at you for answers

22:01.686 --> 22:03.187
before he even knows
the goddamn question.

22:03.255 --> 22:05.323
Is that a problem?

22:05.391 --> 22:06.824
For some guys, maybe,
but not for me,

22:06.892 --> 22:08.292
but the thing is...

22:08.360 --> 22:09.794
and you can bite my head off
if you want to...

22:09.862 --> 22:12.463
the higher you go up,
the crappier you look.

22:12.531 --> 22:13.865
Is that right?

22:13.933 --> 22:15.533
Sometimes you walk around
with this face

22:15.568 --> 22:17.335
like you want to put someone's
head through a wall.

22:17.403 --> 22:18.903
What's up with that?

22:18.971 --> 22:20.739
I got things on my mind.

22:20.806 --> 22:23.375
You know what you need...
some strange.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.143
I'm married with a kid, Chris.

22:25.211 --> 22:27.580
I'm short and I'm bald.
It doesn't stop me.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.382
Now, look,

22:30.450 --> 22:33.853
you see the Contessa
down the bar there?

22:33.920 --> 22:36.855
She's been looking at you
the whole night.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.490
She's not my type.

22:38.558 --> 22:39.992
What are you looking for,
a blood donor?

22:40.060 --> 22:42.761
Go over there, chat her up,

22:42.829 --> 22:44.063
show her your piece.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.564
Yeah, I don't think so.

22:45.632 --> 22:46.732
Why not? I got nothing
to say to her.

22:46.800 --> 22:47.933
Oh, my God! Say anything.

22:48.001 --> 22:49.434
This is a bar.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.103
Nobody listens
to what anyone says in a bar.

22:51.171 --> 22:52.504
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

22:52.572 --> 22:53.839
Like...

22:53.907 --> 22:57.510
You go up to her,
and you say, "hi."

22:57.578 --> 22:59.679
Can I buy you a drink?"

22:59.747 --> 23:01.681
She's thinking, "I wonder
if he'll go down on me"

23:01.749 --> 23:03.149
even if I don't take a shower."

23:04.485 --> 23:08.121
Unleash your python
on that lovely lady.

23:09.290 --> 23:11.124
I will see you tomorrow.

23:11.192 --> 23:13.827
Big dogs got to hunt.

23:28.044 --> 23:29.511
May I?

23:33.850 --> 23:34.883
I am so sorry.

23:34.951 --> 23:36.018
It's nothing.

23:37.987 --> 23:39.955
Oh.

23:42.057 --> 23:44.392
Do you remember the last time
we saw each other?

23:44.460 --> 23:46.627
Of course I do.
I told you that...

23:46.695 --> 23:48.262
that you were ending
the relationship

23:48.330 --> 23:51.799
because I was going away,
and you've met someone else.

24:02.210 --> 24:03.477
That's my son...

24:06.581 --> 24:08.249
our son.

24:12.221 --> 24:15.923
When you were admitted
to the academy, I was pregnant.

24:19.194 --> 24:20.427
Why didn't you tell me?

24:20.494 --> 24:22.796
Because you never
would have left.

24:22.863 --> 24:25.131
You would have been true
to me and the baby,

24:25.199 --> 24:28.033
and you wouldn't have followed
your dream... our dream.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.941
He's a good boy.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.778
He's going into the army
before the university.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.447
He wants to serve.

24:53.561 --> 24:55.462
I cried...

24:55.530 --> 24:57.831
For a long time after you left.

24:57.899 --> 25:00.334
I prayed that one day
we'd be together.

25:00.401 --> 25:02.803
I didn't believe in God,
but I prayed.

25:14.148 --> 25:15.415
I'm ready now, mischa.

26:16.309 --> 26:17.276
What's wrong?

26:17.344 --> 26:18.811
What do you mean?

26:18.878 --> 26:20.746
You said you had to see me.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.147
I did.

26:23.483 --> 26:24.516
Why?

26:26.553 --> 26:28.554
I...

26:29.990 --> 26:33.626
That's a good question.

26:33.694 --> 26:35.561
Are you drunk?

26:35.629 --> 26:37.396
Maybe. A little.

26:38.966 --> 26:40.667
Enough.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.341
Nina.

27:15.201 --> 27:16.701
Hello?

27:16.769 --> 27:18.603
Oh, did I wake you?

27:22.608 --> 27:24.809
Are... are the kids okay?

27:24.877 --> 27:27.979
Yeah, yeah. No, they're...
everyone's fine.

27:28.047 --> 27:30.849
We had dinner at the Beeman's.

27:30.917 --> 27:32.317
Stan never showed up.

27:32.385 --> 27:33.719
I-I think they're
having some problems...

27:33.786 --> 27:36.088
you know,
some personal problems.

27:40.126 --> 27:43.362
I've been... I've been
thinking about you...

27:45.765 --> 27:47.632
about us.

27:49.602 --> 27:51.069
I miss you.

27:58.577 --> 27:59.811
Are you there?

28:03.282 --> 28:05.616
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.

28:08.820 --> 28:11.388
Come home.

28:50.264 --> 28:52.098
You don't have to worry.

28:52.166 --> 28:54.601
What happened happened.

28:57.839 --> 29:00.040
I wanted you.

29:04.813 --> 29:06.881
It never has to happen again.

29:10.353 --> 29:13.221
I'm not going to hurt you
or use it against you,

29:13.289 --> 29:15.757
so smile.

29:15.825 --> 29:17.125
It's okay.

29:18.628 --> 29:21.497
You Americans think everything
is white and black.

29:21.565 --> 29:25.468
For us, everything is gray.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.014
Andrzej! Andrzej!

29:37.082 --> 29:38.348
Mr. Bielawski!

29:38.416 --> 29:41.485
Open, open.

29:41.552 --> 29:43.086
Excuse me.

29:43.154 --> 29:44.655
Charles?

29:44.722 --> 29:46.190
What have you done?

29:46.257 --> 29:48.492
Do you have any idea
of the damage you've done?

29:48.560 --> 29:50.861
I drank too much.
I made a fool of myself.

29:50.929 --> 29:52.830
You've done more than that.

29:54.432 --> 29:56.200
You jeopardized
the entire movement

29:56.267 --> 29:58.735
for a free and independent
Eastern Europe.

30:02.874 --> 30:04.274
Where did you get these?

30:04.342 --> 30:06.443
What did you think?
Were you thinking?!

30:08.446 --> 30:11.048
I don't remember.

30:11.115 --> 30:13.050
Anne called me from
the police station last night.

30:13.118 --> 30:15.519
You're lucky that I had contacts
in the police department.

30:15.587 --> 30:17.320
I don't understand.

30:17.388 --> 30:19.590
What, that you were drunk,
that you look like shit...

30:20.926 --> 30:22.726
that you raped her?!

30:22.794 --> 30:26.296
Charles, this is a lie.
This is a lie!

30:26.364 --> 30:27.731
Anne is in the hospital!

30:27.799 --> 30:29.466
Any moment,
the police are gonna come

30:29.534 --> 30:31.001
scouring your room
for evidence.

30:31.069 --> 30:32.036
Evidence? What the...

30:32.103 --> 30:33.971
blood on the sheets!

30:34.039 --> 30:36.140
Blood from bruising...

30:36.208 --> 30:38.542
Like the bruises on your hand?!

30:38.610 --> 30:40.644
Charles...

30:42.280 --> 30:43.314
help me.

30:43.382 --> 30:47.385
Charles, help me, please.

30:50.289 --> 30:53.659
Andrzej is a good man,

30:53.726 --> 30:55.661
and we destroyed him.

30:57.130 --> 30:59.331
I can't do it anymore...
I can't.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.567
I want to live
like a normal human being.

31:01.635 --> 31:02.668
Irina.

31:02.736 --> 31:05.371
No, I-I'll disappear.

31:05.439 --> 31:08.174
I have passports. I have money.

31:09.242 --> 31:11.877
Come with me, mischa.

31:11.945 --> 31:15.248
We'll disappear together,
and they will never find us.

31:33.836 --> 31:36.138
May I have a word
with you, Mr. Fucci?

31:36.205 --> 31:38.273
Uh, talk to someone up front
about scheduling a move.

31:38.341 --> 31:40.242
Oh, yeah, no, I'm not moving.

31:40.310 --> 31:42.178
I mean, I'm not moving-moving.

31:42.246 --> 31:44.614
I just need a minute
of your time.

31:44.682 --> 31:47.651
It's about a friend of mine,
Sandford Prince.

31:47.718 --> 31:49.920
He doesn't have friends.

31:49.988 --> 31:51.855
He has one... me.

31:51.923 --> 31:55.326
Well, your <i>friend</i>
<i>is into me for 20 grand.</i>

31:55.394 --> 31:56.560
Right.

31:58.830 --> 32:00.765
It's all there.

32:02.768 --> 32:05.669
He's not for sale. Why not?

32:05.737 --> 32:09.340
Because he's a clit,
and I prefer my pound of flesh.

32:09.407 --> 32:10.541
Okay.

32:12.177 --> 32:14.511
Well, the thing is, um...

32:16.014 --> 32:17.782
I'm not asking.

32:21.920 --> 32:22.953
No?

32:23.021 --> 32:24.588
Mm, no.

32:27.927 --> 32:29.394
Um...

32:33.266 --> 32:35.834
I'm telling you
how it's gonna be.

32:37.136 --> 32:39.137
There's $20,000 cash
in an envelope.

32:39.204 --> 32:42.073
It is yours.
In return, I get Prince.

32:42.141 --> 32:43.208
He is mine.

32:48.781 --> 32:49.848
Aah!

32:55.155 --> 32:56.255
What's up?

32:58.391 --> 33:00.592
When is the right time
to exfiltrate a source?

33:00.660 --> 33:02.027
Never.

33:02.095 --> 33:03.529
There's no gold watch
in this business.

33:03.596 --> 33:06.832
I've given my source
at the Rezidentura assurances.

33:08.334 --> 33:09.934
You told her
what you had to tell her.

33:10.002 --> 33:13.104
Anyway, the Russians think
they've found their mole.

33:13.172 --> 33:14.205
She's safe.

33:14.273 --> 33:15.439
Well, for now.

33:15.507 --> 33:17.074
She's not an ingenue, Beeman.

33:17.142 --> 33:18.542
She's a spy.

33:18.577 --> 33:20.578
She could have you and me
for breakfast.

33:26.418 --> 33:28.870
Has she had you
for breakfast, Stan?

33:31.756 --> 33:33.757
She has held up
her end of the bargain.

33:33.825 --> 33:35.926
We cannot just feed her
to the wolves.

33:35.994 --> 33:39.096
Okay. I get it.

33:39.164 --> 33:41.398
You're worried
about her safety.

33:41.466 --> 33:43.834
I'll think about it.

33:48.441 --> 33:51.476
<i>I'm stepping aside from
the Polish liberation movement</i>

33:51.544 --> 33:53.979
<i>to tend to my personal</i>
<i>and spiritual life.</i>

33:54.046 --> 33:57.883
<i>I will no longer attempt</i>
<i>to form a government in exile.</i>

33:57.951 --> 34:00.086
<i>What does this
mean for the democracy movement?</i>

34:00.153 --> 34:01.554
<i>Who will take your place?</i>

34:01.622 --> 34:03.290
<i>I have nothing further</i>
<i>to say, please.</i>

34:03.357 --> 34:05.325
<i>What about the Polish worker?</i>

34:08.730 --> 34:11.231
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

34:13.333 --> 34:15.001
I'm not going with you.

34:17.739 --> 34:20.107
Did you tell them?
Is it over for me?

34:20.175 --> 34:21.373
No.

34:22.376 --> 34:23.976
Run, Irina. Disappear.

34:24.045 --> 34:25.411
Go where
they'll never find you.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.813
Come with me, mischa.

34:28.750 --> 34:29.882
I can't.

34:31.753 --> 34:33.320
They don't care about you.

34:33.388 --> 34:35.255
They don't care
what happens to any of us.

34:35.322 --> 34:38.759
I have a wife, family.

34:40.561 --> 34:42.195
Why are you here, then?

34:44.864 --> 34:46.933
The boy...

34:47.001 --> 34:48.201
is he real?

34:50.572 --> 34:53.474
Only duty and honor
are real, mischa.

34:53.542 --> 34:55.944
Isn't that what we were told?

34:56.012 --> 34:57.846
<i>Attention, passengers.</i>

34:57.914 --> 35:00.949
<i>The 11:00 train to Montreal</i>
<i>is now boarding on track 16.</i>

35:01.017 --> 35:04.553
<i>Track 16...</i>
<i>the 11:00 train to Montreal.</i>

35:50.902 --> 35:54.337
I paid your debt, Sandford,
which means you're mine now.

35:54.404 --> 35:55.738
Are we all right with that?

35:55.806 --> 35:57.340
Do I have a choice?

35:57.408 --> 35:58.842
No.

36:00.144 --> 36:02.011
Oh, come on. It's not so bad.

36:02.079 --> 36:03.713
I'm not your wicked stepmother.

36:03.781 --> 36:05.014
What do you have for me?

36:05.082 --> 36:07.617
There's a team
at livermore labs,

36:07.684 --> 36:09.552
works with lasers,
X-ray physics.

36:09.620 --> 36:11.687
Yeah, they've been working
in missile defense for years

36:11.755 --> 36:12.722
with very little success.

36:12.790 --> 36:13.890
Until now.

36:13.957 --> 36:15.291
They've had a breakthrough.

36:15.359 --> 36:17.027
It's only a matter of time.

36:17.094 --> 36:18.928
It's all in there.

36:26.336 --> 36:27.770
Good.

36:45.323 --> 36:47.291
Anyone home?

36:47.358 --> 36:48.726
In here.

36:52.196 --> 36:53.830
Where's mom?

36:58.636 --> 36:59.836
<i>Anyone</i> miss me?

36:59.904 --> 37:01.972
You're so funny sometimes, dad.

37:03.707 --> 37:04.941
How was New York?

37:05.009 --> 37:06.810
It was fine.

37:06.878 --> 37:09.313
Did you see any hobos
or drug dealers?

37:10.582 --> 37:11.749
A few.

37:11.817 --> 37:13.852
Okay.

37:16.355 --> 37:17.489
No.

37:18.591 --> 37:21.927
Your move.

37:31.671 --> 37:33.705
How'd it go?

37:33.773 --> 37:35.140
Bielawski's finished.

37:35.207 --> 37:38.009
The Reagan administration
doesn't want a rapist

37:38.077 --> 37:40.612
leading the movement to push
the Soviets out of Poland.

37:40.680 --> 37:42.881
Right, they're afraid
if the KGB found out,

37:42.949 --> 37:44.516
they'd use it against them.

37:44.584 --> 37:46.117
Yeah.

37:46.185 --> 37:47.285
Philip.

37:50.956 --> 37:52.457
When they tortured us,

37:52.524 --> 37:55.994
I blamed you
for what happened...

37:56.061 --> 37:58.129
To me, to us.

37:58.197 --> 37:59.964
It wasn't your fault.

38:00.031 --> 38:01.265
I'm sorry.

38:06.604 --> 38:08.105
I missed you.

38:10.141 --> 38:11.242
I didn't want to.

38:12.711 --> 38:16.848
I want us to be able
to say what's true.

38:16.915 --> 38:20.384
I want us... it to be...

38:22.120 --> 38:23.687
What?

38:23.755 --> 38:26.324
I want it to be...

38:28.293 --> 38:30.227
real.

38:30.295 --> 38:32.663
Do you think that...

38:34.132 --> 38:36.900
we could do that?

38:39.069 --> 38:40.804
I don't know.

38:43.574 --> 38:45.442
I would try.

38:45.510 --> 38:48.145
Will you try?

39:01.425 --> 39:03.259
Yes.

39:09.365 --> 39:10.933
Um...

39:11.000 --> 39:12.734
I have to ask you something.

39:12.802 --> 39:15.470
Just promise
you'll tell me the truth.

39:15.538 --> 39:16.704
Of course.

39:19.675 --> 39:21.909
Did something happen
between you and Irina?

39:23.502 --> 39:24.479
Do you still love her?

39:25.046 --> 39:27.481
Nothing happened.

39:29.384 --> 39:30.551
There's only you.

39:30.619 --> 39:32.620
It has always been you.
