00:04.900 --> 00:06.790
Previously on Blunt Talk.

00:06.790 --> 00:09.480
I'm recently divorced for the fourth time.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.440
There are custody issues.

00:11.450 --> 00:12.890
And how old is your ex-wife?

00:12.890 --> 00:14.120
She's 35.

00:15.170 --> 00:16.379
That's very nice.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.000
- Here's your coffee. - Thanks.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.590
Where'd you get those mugs?

00:21.590 --> 00:23.700
All I found in the kitchen were these paper cups.

00:23.700 --> 00:26.660
Oh, and Jim's sushi from yesterday, which I ate.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.370
That wasn't from yesterday.

00:29.170 --> 00:30.260
Are you married?

00:32.890 --> 00:35.050
Did you give that young man a ride home again?

00:35.050 --> 00:37.850
I did. I told him we have an open marriage.

00:37.850 --> 00:40.900
I met a woman, you know, at the salad bar at Whole Foods.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.580
You told me about her two nights ago.

00:43.580 --> 00:44.440
I did?

00:44.610 --> 00:48.390
I need to be a better father to the American people.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.660
And, of course, to my own children.

01:26.030 --> 01:27.760
Oh, Harry, there you are.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.000
Yes, Major.

01:32.540 --> 01:35.410
It appears I went below deck for a little while.

01:35.410 --> 01:38.830
I've been thinking, Harry, while you were gone.

01:39.340 --> 01:43.840
Drinking makes us sadder, not happier.

01:43.980 --> 01:45.590
Have you noticed that?

01:45.890 --> 01:48.490
Yes, Major. I have noticed.

01:49.390 --> 01:51.340
For how long have you noticed?

01:51.340 --> 01:54.330
Off and on for the last 10 years.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.940
Well, it's only after the fourth drink

01:56.940 --> 01:58.890
that things turn bleak.

01:58.900 --> 02:01.470
But now that I'm going to AA,

02:02.420 --> 02:04.540
I think we should start cutting back.

02:04.540 --> 02:06.420
That would be prudent, sir.

02:13.710 --> 02:14.590
Harry.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.580
Yes, Major?

02:19.690 --> 02:21.980
I'm very scared about tomorrow.

02:22.690 --> 02:25.480
I know your fears seem real, Major,

02:25.570 --> 02:28.090
but let me remind you who you are.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.690
You've interviewed world dignitaries.

02:30.690 --> 02:33.140
You've jumped out of airplanes.

02:33.180 --> 02:36.840
You've had malaria and shingles twice.

02:37.340 --> 02:39.020
You've been wounded in battle.

02:39.120 --> 02:42.490
And you saved my life in battle.

02:43.590 --> 02:47.600
So I think you can face a five-year-old boy who loves you.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.130
Thank you, Harry.

03:09.080 --> 03:13.370
Only in Los Angeles would you have valet parking at a preschool.

03:14.440 --> 03:15.510
Yes, sir.

03:17.890 --> 03:19.590
Harry, did we make the right choice?

03:19.590 --> 03:21.810
Is this jacket paternal enough?

03:23.960 --> 03:27.690
Today is day one of being a better father.

03:29.950 --> 03:31.770
Okay, there they are.

03:34.550 --> 03:35.460
Shit.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.250
Fucking dickhead car.

03:40.150 --> 03:42.620
Vivian! Bertie!

03:42.620 --> 03:44.340
Oh, it's Daddy.

03:45.410 --> 03:47.240
Walter Blunt!

03:50.790 --> 03:52.720
Oh, you know,

03:53.620 --> 03:56.190
you can call me Dad, Bertie.

03:56.190 --> 03:58.640
You know? Walter Blunt is for the public.

03:59.010 --> 03:59.650
Hi, Vivian.

03:59.650 --> 04:02.000
Hi. I'm surprised you made it.

04:02.830 --> 04:04.640
Well, of course I made it.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.970
I got the email.

04:05.970 --> 04:07.980
I volunteered for story corner.

04:07.990 --> 04:11.040
I have got a thrilling passage to read.

04:12.280 --> 04:16.070
Um, did I just smell alcohol on your breath?

04:16.740 --> 04:17.920
Aftershave.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.829
Here. Take two.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.190
Come on.

04:27.460 --> 04:29.180
What's happened to all our coffee mugs?

04:29.180 --> 04:32.960
- It's weird. - I know, it's confusing.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.540
Guys, can I tell you something personal

04:35.540 --> 04:38.820
and strange and homoerotic that's bothering me?

04:38.820 --> 04:40.910
Please. I love that kind of stuff.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.300
- Yeah, me, too. - Well, last night I dreamt that--

04:43.300 --> 04:45.510
Jim, did you see the new cut of my segment

04:45.510 --> 04:47.230
on fecal impaction therapy?

04:47.550 --> 04:50.350
I did. It was very interesting.

04:50.350 --> 04:52.530
Um, I'm sorry. I got to get to the edit.

04:52.530 --> 04:54.850
Martin, we'll talk about your homoerotic story later.

04:54.850 --> 04:55.990
Jim, don't kill the piece.

04:55.990 --> 04:58.360
Fecal impaction therapy is good for the immune system.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.940
Jim, Terrence from HR called.

04:59.940 --> 05:01.590
He wants you to come to his office.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.260
- The big guy? - Yeah.

05:05.340 --> 05:06.180
Shit.

05:07.020 --> 05:10.650
*Always be yourself, but if you can be a unicorn*

05:10.650 --> 05:13.070
*always be a unicorn*

05:13.140 --> 05:14.520
*Just the men*

05:14.530 --> 05:18.230
*Always be yourself, but if you can be a unicorn*

05:18.230 --> 05:20.270
*always be a unicorn*

05:20.270 --> 05:22.300
- Jumping! - He's so cute.

05:22.300 --> 05:24.710
Bertie's voice is the most beautiful.

05:26.140 --> 05:26.790
Well, it is.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.910
I know, but people are trying to listen, Walter. Shh.

05:28.910 --> 05:32.770
*Always be yourself, but if you can be a unicorn*

05:32.770 --> 05:34.910
*Always be a unicorn*

05:34.910 --> 05:36.630
Are there any unicorns here?

05:36.630 --> 05:37.930
Yeah!

05:37.930 --> 05:39.740
Are there any unicorns here?

05:39.740 --> 05:41.260
Yeah!

05:43.600 --> 05:45.070
Thank you. Thank you so much.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.030
I've been a musician for my entire life

05:48.240 --> 05:50.410
and honestly, this is both

05:50.410 --> 05:52.610
a personal highlight and a career highlight.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.840
I don't get it. Who is this idiot?

05:55.260 --> 05:57.540
It's Moby the rock star.

05:57.540 --> 05:59.320
- What? - Moby the rock star.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.440
- Moby? - Moby.

06:00.440 --> 06:01.740
Like Moby-Dick?

06:02.750 --> 06:05.240
Walter, Westlake is very lucky to have him.

06:05.250 --> 06:06.340
- Yeah? - Yeah.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.080
Do you think he named himself?

06:10.110 --> 06:12.330
And if you'll have me back,

06:12.740 --> 06:13.990
I'd love to come back next year

06:13.990 --> 06:16.380
and continue my tenure

06:16.590 --> 06:19.350
as musician in residence here at Westlake Preschool.

06:22.540 --> 06:24.380
One more time!

06:24.390 --> 06:27.970
*Always be yourself, but if you can be a unicorn*

06:27.980 --> 06:29.290
*Always be a unicorn*

06:29.960 --> 06:31.750
Run in circles!

06:35.300 --> 06:36.300
Martin?

06:38.130 --> 06:40.250
No, it's me. Not Martin.

06:40.460 --> 06:42.740
Teddy, what are you doing here?

06:42.740 --> 06:44.810
Can't I bring my lovely wife flowers?

06:46.930 --> 06:48.380
I lost my keys again.

06:48.380 --> 06:51.480
Oh, no, how is this possible?

06:51.480 --> 06:52.590
I don't know.

06:53.150 --> 06:54.870
I was at the hardware store getting ant spray,

06:54.870 --> 06:57.370
tried to remember this poem by Mark Strand.

06:58.020 --> 07:00.850
"I open the family album and look at myself as a boy.

07:00.860 --> 07:02.330
What good does it do?"

07:03.780 --> 07:07.170
You can remember poetry, but you lose your keys.

07:07.170 --> 07:09.650
I guess so. When I went out to the parking lot,

07:09.650 --> 07:12.260
the keys were gone, so I took an Uber here.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.910
I'm so sorry.

07:19.270 --> 07:22.580
You know, we haven't made love in your office in a long time.

07:24.700 --> 07:28.450
"'The best thing for being sad,' replied Merlin,

07:28.690 --> 07:31.000
'is to learn something.

07:31.350 --> 07:34.580
That is the only thing that never fails.

07:34.580 --> 07:37.540
You may miss your only love,

07:38.060 --> 07:40.300
you may see the world about you

07:40.410 --> 07:44.090
devastated by evil lunatics,

07:44.140 --> 07:48.480
or know your honor trampled in the sewers

07:48.480 --> 07:50.390
of baser minds.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.820
There is only one thing for it then,

07:54.450 --> 07:56.330
to learn.'"

07:58.040 --> 08:00.480
Thank you. Thank you.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.200
I don't want a explanation, Mr. Stone.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.770
You have to let us in your office.

08:05.770 --> 08:06.720
Now, I've been emailing you.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.490
And I meant to write you back.

08:08.490 --> 08:10.470
The cleaning staff says it's been seven months.

08:10.470 --> 08:13.350
It's against fire code to put your own lock on the door.

08:13.350 --> 08:16.170
I don't like strangers in my office touching things.

08:16.170 --> 08:18.380
Especially after they've been cleaning the bathroom.

08:18.380 --> 08:20.640
- Mr. Stone-- - People don't wash their hands.

08:20.840 --> 08:22.590
That's how diarrhea gets spread.

08:22.590 --> 08:23.630
Diarrhea?

08:23.630 --> 08:25.530
Like if I put my hand on your desk

08:25.530 --> 08:27.310
and then I put a finger in my mouth

08:27.310 --> 08:29.750
without thinking, which happens all the time--

08:29.750 --> 08:31.190
What are you doing? Stop that.

08:31.190 --> 08:32.260
I'm just trying to demonstrate

08:32.260 --> 08:34.159
that if there's diarrhea on your desk,

08:34.159 --> 08:35.490
I just put it in my mouth.

08:35.490 --> 08:37.450
There is no diarrhea on my desk.

08:37.460 --> 08:38.700
In a perfect world.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.130
This has gone on long enough.

08:40.130 --> 08:41.500
I'll have maintenance let me in your office.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.720
Hold it. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:44.640 --> 08:45.950
Wait, um...

08:53.870 --> 08:56.580
Tell me about diarrhea on my desk.

09:06.860 --> 09:08.200
What are you doing here?

09:08.200 --> 09:09.890
How did you get past security?

09:09.890 --> 09:11.260
Have you seen my smile?

09:11.340 --> 09:13.860
Well, you shouldn't have come here without asking me first.

09:13.860 --> 09:16.370
- That's stalking. - How am I supposed to ask you?

09:16.370 --> 09:17.730
I've sent you dozens of texts.

09:17.730 --> 09:19.580
You haven't responded to any of them.

09:20.140 --> 09:21.640
Well, you're a married man.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.660
Doesn't mean I don't have feelings.

09:23.860 --> 09:26.430
Listen, it was very nice with you.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.220
Wonderful, actually.

09:28.220 --> 09:29.470
But it was a one-time thing.

09:29.470 --> 09:30.670
I don't want to hurt another woman.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.840
No, no, no. I told you we're separated.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.470
Y-yeah, we still live in the same house,

09:34.470 --> 09:36.630
but you can be together and be separated.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.340
How would you do that, magic?

09:39.580 --> 09:40.410
Yes.

09:40.930 --> 09:42.770
Let me tell you what I love about you.

09:42.790 --> 09:46.470
I love that you say that you like American chocolate.

09:46.470 --> 09:49.350
Although we both know it's not as good as the British chocolate.

09:49.350 --> 09:52.940
I love that you could have waved the flag on not dating me,

09:52.940 --> 09:54.610
but you didn't. You took a shot.

09:54.610 --> 09:57.030
And that before the date you actually took a shot.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.050
I love that you get that little crinkle above your nose

09:59.060 --> 10:01.490
'cause I'm expressing myself through lame magic tricks.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.820
I love that you're the first person 

10:02.820 --> 10:04.100
I want to pick a card in the morning

10:04.100 --> 10:05.800
and the last person I want to pick a card at night.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.690
And you're probably sick of all the card tricks.

10:09.550 --> 10:11.790
I came here today because I realized

10:11.930 --> 10:14.870
that you and I, we have a joint connection.

10:15.110 --> 10:16.550
And when you have a joint connection,

10:16.550 --> 10:19.480
you kind of want that joint to start as soon as possible.

10:22.420 --> 10:24.480
- Are those real? - Of course they are.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.630
- They're vintage. - I told you I love pearls.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.280
How much did those cost?

10:29.280 --> 10:32.260
Oh, a magician never reveals his secrets.

10:32.260 --> 10:35.220
But I do want to impress you. $2,000.

10:47.300 --> 10:48.150
Hello.

10:49.140 --> 10:51.000
You're my son's music teacher.

10:51.430 --> 10:52.200
I'm Walter Blunt.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.260
I just washed my hands. I shouldn't shake.

10:54.370 --> 10:56.040
I don't mind a wet hand.

10:56.380 --> 10:57.790
You know, it's funny,

10:57.990 --> 10:59.350
given the terms of my parole,

10:59.350 --> 11:01.740
I probably shouldn't even be using that bathroom.

11:04.550 --> 11:06.450
Oh, I'm sorry. That was a joke.

11:07.020 --> 11:08.640
Your son is very talented, Walter.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.730
It's nice to meet you.

11:12.810 --> 11:14.550
Hi, how are ya?

11:15.430 --> 11:17.320
All right, see you, okay.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.160
That was very intimate.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.230
Are you dating Moby-Dick?

11:24.230 --> 11:26.640
It's just Moby. No Dick.

11:26.640 --> 11:27.540
And, yes, I am.

11:27.540 --> 11:28.530
And when did this happen?

11:28.530 --> 11:30.530
Walter, we're divorced. It's none of your business.

11:30.530 --> 11:33.460
Yes, it is my business. I don't want my son exposed

11:33.460 --> 11:35.560
to a debauched rock star who's doing drugs.

11:35.570 --> 11:36.680
He's a vegan

11:36.680 --> 11:38.750
and he's sober. Unlike you.

11:39.070 --> 11:41.250
Bertie's parents? You can come in now.

11:48.340 --> 11:50.730
I need to show you something that could be a problem.

11:50.730 --> 11:52.550
Morning Joe did the exact same story

11:52.560 --> 11:54.990
I produced for the health segment tonight. Read it.

12:06.260 --> 12:07.850
- That is odd. - Yeah.

12:07.850 --> 12:10.540
MSNBC did your fecal impaction story.

12:10.850 --> 12:12.450
Probably just zeitgeist.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.910
Fecal impaction therapy is very zeitgeist, I admit,

12:15.910 --> 12:19.640
but the way they linked dead modern foods and dead colons,

12:19.650 --> 12:21.360
it's too weird and similar.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.200
Someone must have leaked my story after we left last night.

12:24.670 --> 12:25.800
I'm telling Rosalie.

12:25.800 --> 12:29.040
It's zeitgeist. You're being paranoid.

12:30.270 --> 12:32.970
Not now, Shelly. We're busy.

12:32.970 --> 12:35.060
- But Morning Joe-- - It can wait.

12:36.220 --> 12:37.730
Are you Martin?

12:37.830 --> 12:39.480
Oh, I've heard a lot about you.

12:40.480 --> 12:41.300
Rosalie.

12:43.870 --> 12:45.420
I can't trust you to be alone with him.

12:45.420 --> 12:46.950
You can't even take care of yourself.

12:46.950 --> 12:48.590
- That's not true. - It is true.

12:48.590 --> 12:49.840
I know your pattern, Walter.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.420
The anniversary of the Falklands is coming up.

12:51.430 --> 12:52.170
And that-- no!

12:52.190 --> 12:54.060
That is when you and Harry really go nuts.

12:54.060 --> 12:56.430
- Who's Harry? - We remember the fallen.

12:56.430 --> 12:58.320
We're here to talk about Bertie's academics, so--

12:58.320 --> 13:00.180
You had alcohol on your breath this morning.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.630
Listen, I worked with my team till 2:00 AM last night

13:02.640 --> 13:04.220
so I could be at this parents' day.

13:04.220 --> 13:05.190
When I got home,

13:05.190 --> 13:07.470
I had a couple of scotches just to help me sleep.

13:07.470 --> 13:09.050
- A couple? - You should also know

13:09.050 --> 13:10.730
that we were working on a health special

13:10.730 --> 13:13.060
inspired by my concern for Bertie.

13:13.130 --> 13:14.300
As you will see tonight.

13:14.310 --> 13:15.300
Well, we've stopped watching.

13:15.300 --> 13:16.740
I think it confuses him.

13:17.770 --> 13:19.720
You don't even let him watch me on TV?

13:19.720 --> 13:21.610
Have you guys thought of FaceTiming?

13:21.610 --> 13:25.060
That seems to work for a lot of our families in your situation.

13:25.060 --> 13:28.930
I like that. I think you need to work on your listening skills.

13:28.930 --> 13:32.320
I don't know how to FaceTime. I'm on AOL.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.930
Ah! Fuck!

13:48.390 --> 13:49.770
Where are you, Major?

13:50.140 --> 13:51.570
Oh, there you are.

13:52.130 --> 13:54.040
I'm gonna stay in the Challenger

13:54.140 --> 13:56.510
and sleep off the rest of this hangover, sir.

13:56.510 --> 13:59.600
Harry, I hate this car like an infection.

13:59.600 --> 14:03.280
I'll say it again, sir. You could sit in the front seat.

14:03.280 --> 14:05.540
And you could sit on my face.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.640
Jim, we know you're in there

14:09.640 --> 14:11.360
and we need your advice on something.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.280
Can't right now. Having an issue.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.430
Sorry to let you down, buddy.

14:14.430 --> 14:17.400
Just give me 20 minutes. Maybe 25.

14:17.450 --> 14:20.040
I still want to hear your homoerotic story.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.490
- What? - Just--

14:21.730 --> 14:22.910
Let's go to Celia's.

14:22.910 --> 14:24.250
Ooh, I saw her go in there a while ago.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.180
She's always napping.

14:25.180 --> 14:26.960
Well, she has an iron deficiency.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.480
Right.

14:29.950 --> 14:31.040
I'm indisposed.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.300
I'll be out in 10 minutes.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.230
We have a problem with my beautiful segment.

14:34.230 --> 14:36.380
I'll be out in 10 minutes!

14:36.380 --> 14:37.410
What's going on?

14:37.420 --> 14:39.090
MSNBC ran a piece this morning

14:39.090 --> 14:41.370
that's eerily similar to the segment I produced.

14:41.370 --> 14:42.270
Eerily?

14:42.280 --> 14:44.680
I think we've been hacked or we have a leak.

14:44.680 --> 14:47.560
Or Shelly's paranoid and it's just zeitgeist.

14:47.560 --> 14:48.600
Stop saying zeitgeist.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.080
Just either way, we need to come up with a new health segment.

14:51.080 --> 14:52.940
I'd like to suggest an equally beautiful segment

14:52.940 --> 14:54.210
that I cut together a few weeks ago.

14:54.210 --> 14:54.930
Stop saying beautiful.

14:54.930 --> 14:56.950
It's a beautiful segment that Jim killed

14:56.960 --> 14:58.270
about how emotional trauma

14:58.270 --> 15:00.250
can be stored in our DNA and then passed on.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.920
That Harvard worm study.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.080
Oh, yeah. You know it. It's good, right?

15:04.080 --> 15:05.800
Hi, Mr. Blunt.

15:10.570 --> 15:11.960
Hello, Walter.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.580
Vivian is dating a musician.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.640
Now it's really over.

15:31.650 --> 15:35.460
Walter, you've been divorced seven months.

15:35.460 --> 15:37.770
But this has reopened the wound.

15:37.770 --> 15:41.110
You need to put a veneer over your heart.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.810
I've told you this before.

15:42.810 --> 15:45.860
I will, later. Right now I'd just like to spoon,

15:45.860 --> 15:47.700
if that's all right with you?

15:48.260 --> 15:51.400
I don't know that we have time to spoon right now.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.830
We have an issue.

15:52.830 --> 15:55.140
She also won't let me see Bertie.

15:55.140 --> 15:56.640
Well, she's probably right.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.310
I'm a terrible father.

15:58.380 --> 16:00.540
He'd be better off with Moby.

16:00.850 --> 16:02.550
She's dating Moby?

16:03.290 --> 16:07.310
Just be patient. Vivian's not unreasonable. Now listen--

16:07.310 --> 16:10.920
But I'm losing my way again, Rosalie. I can feel it.

16:10.920 --> 16:14.610
I'm uncentered, unmoored.

16:14.620 --> 16:16.430
You can't lose your way again.

16:16.430 --> 16:18.240
You just lost it two weeks ago.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.700
I need one of my men to keep it together.

16:20.700 --> 16:21.900
What's that supposed to mean?

16:21.900 --> 16:24.680
It means stop being a baby.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.350
Then spoon me.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.920
Jesus Christ!

16:35.000 --> 16:39.270
We need to replace Shelly's fecal impaction story.

16:39.280 --> 16:42.300
MSNBC ran the same thing this morning.

16:42.300 --> 16:43.640
Oh, damn it.

16:43.650 --> 16:47.030
That whole health series was meant for Bertie.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.770
Mr. Blunt.

16:50.150 --> 16:52.720
Now what the hell is going on here?

16:52.820 --> 16:54.080
Spooning.

16:54.760 --> 16:55.860
Hi, Walter.

16:59.250 --> 17:00.210
Jim.

17:02.190 --> 17:03.780
Jim, it's Walter.

17:04.060 --> 17:05.940
You need to open your door.

17:06.079 --> 17:07.869
I can't right now, Walter.

17:07.869 --> 17:10.530
I'll come out later after everyone's gone.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.960
Is this a cry for help, Jim?

17:13.430 --> 17:15.450
- No! - Are you sure?

17:15.450 --> 17:19.420
Because I've been told that I'm not a good listener.

17:19.420 --> 17:22.619
If you've been crying out and I haven't heard you...

17:22.619 --> 17:26.270
No, I have not been crying out.

17:26.270 --> 17:27.730
Then open the door!

17:27.730 --> 17:29.730
Jim, this is a fucking newsroom!

17:29.730 --> 17:31.580
Open the fucking door!

17:35.170 --> 17:37.020
Winston, open him up.

17:37.150 --> 17:38.540
No, no, stop.

17:38.540 --> 17:41.010
Jim is a valued member of my staff.

17:41.010 --> 17:42.930
This is undignified.

17:43.590 --> 17:45.560
Celia, she can reason with him.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.810
They're close. Where is she?

17:48.240 --> 17:49.460
Excuse me.

18:01.020 --> 18:03.100
- Hello. - Who the hell are you?

18:03.100 --> 18:04.700
- Francis. - What is it, Walter?

18:04.700 --> 18:06.270
Um, how was Parents' Day?

18:06.270 --> 18:07.790
Celia, who is this man?

18:08.020 --> 18:09.840
He's a friend. He's a magician.

18:09.840 --> 18:10.800
'Cause I thought it might

18:10.800 --> 18:12.440
be fun to do a little piece on sleight of hand.

18:12.440 --> 18:15.150
I don't have time for this. You have to speak to Jim.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.040
He has locked himself in his office.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.480
- Excuse me. - I don't understand.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.380
Why has Jim locked himself in his office?

18:21.380 --> 18:22.500
We don't know.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.210
He said something about diarrhea.

18:24.210 --> 18:25.630
I couldn't follow him to be honest.

18:25.630 --> 18:27.890
I think I know what's going on here.

18:28.280 --> 18:31.020
He snapped and he leaked my story to Morning Joe.

18:31.020 --> 18:33.750
He always spikes my stories, and this time he leaked one.

18:33.750 --> 18:36.070
I don't like that kind of speculation, Shelly.

18:36.070 --> 18:38.000
Sorry, but I think I'm right.

18:40.350 --> 18:42.450
- Jim. - You do sleight of hand?

18:43.270 --> 18:44.150
Jim.

18:45.330 --> 18:46.920
Do you know where my keys are?

18:46.920 --> 18:49.840
Celia is here. Talk to her.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.110
No, Walter,

18:51.110 --> 18:52.940
she doesn't like me 'cause I'm Jewish.

18:52.940 --> 18:56.000
No, that's not true. No, I like to tease you.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.210
I love that you're Jewish.

18:59.060 --> 19:00.820
What's going on? What's happening?

19:01.400 --> 19:03.720
I have issues.

19:03.940 --> 19:05.650
What kind of issues?

19:06.060 --> 19:07.910
If I told you, you wouldn't like me.

19:07.910 --> 19:09.140
Nobody would.

19:09.140 --> 19:11.570
Of course we would. We all have issues.

19:11.570 --> 19:13.580
I have loneliness issues.

19:13.700 --> 19:16.860
Intimacy issues. Nighttime driving issues.

19:16.860 --> 19:19.860
Anxiety issues. Promiscuity issues.

19:19.860 --> 19:21.940
See, those all sound like fun issues.

19:21.940 --> 19:25.330
Your only issue, Mr. Stone, is to open this damn door.

19:25.340 --> 19:27.080
I don't have time for this craziness.

19:27.090 --> 19:28.630
Yeah, he's right, Jim.

19:28.640 --> 19:31.680
Now, we broadcast in 90 minutes

19:31.680 --> 19:33.550
and we need a new segment.

19:33.550 --> 19:36.660
You didn't leak anything to Morning Joe, did you?

19:36.950 --> 19:37.650
What?

19:37.650 --> 19:41.050
Because if you didn't, then you have nothing to hide.

19:41.050 --> 19:43.640
So open up. That's an order, Jim.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.430
No! I'm a monster.

19:48.560 --> 19:49.610
Open it.

20:01.230 --> 20:04.400
You know, I think we're gonna need to get a locksmith.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.650
Oh, Jesus.

20:05.650 --> 20:07.480
I can try to kick the door down.

20:08.230 --> 20:09.670
I have powerful legs.

20:09.670 --> 20:12.560
- It's true. - No, Teddy, I'll break the door down.

20:12.560 --> 20:14.980
And injure yourself? Mm-mm.

20:22.090 --> 20:23.110
Voila!

20:30.120 --> 20:31.670
He's a hoarder.

20:32.260 --> 20:34.440
Good Lord.

20:37.930 --> 20:40.500
Is that my Queen Elizabeth mug?

20:54.360 --> 20:56.240
And after we come back from the break,

20:56.240 --> 20:58.920
we will tell you about a fascinating Harvard study

20:58.920 --> 21:01.070
which indicates that emotional trauma

21:01.070 --> 21:04.660
can be found in our DNA and passed on.

21:04.860 --> 21:08.090
Put Walter's mike up. Maybe he's gonna praise my writing.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.880
So what is going on with Jim?

21:10.880 --> 21:12.890
Jim's computer is clean.

21:12.890 --> 21:15.730
He didn't leak that story. It was just Zeitgeist.

21:15.730 --> 21:16.140
Told you.

21:16.150 --> 21:19.120
But now I got to talk to him about this hoarding.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.860
No, no, no. I'll go to him. I'll counsel him.

21:21.860 --> 21:24.690
But what's going on? Everybody seems to be losing their mind.

21:24.690 --> 21:27.200
- They take your lead. - Oh, thank you.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.030
They look to you as a father figure.

21:29.030 --> 21:31.140
You crack, they all crack.

21:31.140 --> 21:33.790
You get it together, they all get it together.

21:33.790 --> 21:35.840
So it's because of me that Jim's a hoarder,

21:35.840 --> 21:36.760
Shelly's paranoid,

21:36.760 --> 21:39.690
and Celia's having sex with a magician in her office?

21:39.700 --> 21:42.450
What's wrong with that? She's a senior producer.

21:42.450 --> 21:46.070
And it was very special. He gave me a pearl necklace.

21:48.250 --> 21:52.310
No, no, no, no, no! An actual pearl necklace.

21:55.110 --> 21:58.510
Walter, you-- I meant this. I meant a real necklace.

22:01.430 --> 22:03.730
Harry, there you are.

22:03.730 --> 22:07.030
Oh, Lord. Are you still hungover?

22:07.030 --> 22:08.620
Just about cured.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.760
This herring is restoring my brain cells.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.620
Well, we have to get a move on. We must go to Jim's.

22:14.950 --> 22:16.360
I'll tell you what, though.

22:16.370 --> 22:20.180
You can give me a piece of that herring for courage.

22:20.190 --> 22:22.840
God knows what we're gonna find at Jim's apartment.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.340
Open wide, Major.

22:24.830 --> 22:26.820
Here comes the herring.

22:52.590 --> 22:53.940
These are great, Walter.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.410
Oh, thank you, Jim.

22:56.470 --> 23:00.400
It comes of spending so much time in a tent when I was a Marine.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.380
When my eldest son was little,

23:02.380 --> 23:04.450
I used to do them for him at bedtime.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.510
- Your son the boxer? - Yes.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.450
Rafe the boxer.

23:08.940 --> 23:10.710
I don't do them so much for Bertie,

23:10.710 --> 23:14.510
but then he was born just as I launched Blunt Talk, so...

23:14.510 --> 23:16.470
I know I'm supposed to FaceTime him,

23:16.470 --> 23:18.390
but I don't know how to.

23:18.650 --> 23:21.810
Anyway, I-I'm sorry to have been going on like this.

23:21.810 --> 23:24.700
Look, Jim, I'm here for you.

23:24.850 --> 23:27.430
I know you see me as a father figure.

23:27.430 --> 23:29.610
I don't, actually, Walter.

23:29.620 --> 23:32.450
- Oh? - But I do see you as a mentor.

23:32.450 --> 23:35.530
Like a father mentor?

23:36.100 --> 23:36.970
Sure.

23:37.670 --> 23:39.170
I look up to you.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.250
I-- I--

23:41.350 --> 23:43.910
I hope to be on the air someday just like you.

23:43.910 --> 23:47.970
I like that, Jim. It's healthy to have goals.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.810
But before you ascend to my throne,

23:51.810 --> 23:55.080
let's take baby steps.

23:55.130 --> 23:56.390
Why do you...

23:58.800 --> 23:59.950
you know?

24:00.300 --> 24:02.740
Live like a beaver that's lost his mind?

24:03.050 --> 24:04.210
Exactly.

24:05.470 --> 24:10.840
Well... I think it's a way to put off death.

24:11.860 --> 24:13.490
By never throwing anything away,

24:13.490 --> 24:17.470
then it's like I can use everything again

24:17.470 --> 24:19.850
and live forever.

24:19.860 --> 24:22.340
But you're being buried alive.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.500
I know. It's not quite working.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.720
Oh, well, that's why I am going to help you.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.410
I'm going to pay for you to see my analyst.

24:32.410 --> 24:37.350
That will be my first step as a father mentor figure.

24:37.350 --> 24:38.280
Thank you. Um...

24:40.980 --> 24:44.950
As your son protege figure...

24:45.690 --> 24:48.090
maybe there's something I can do for you.

24:49.610 --> 24:50.780
It's ringing.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.060
Vivian, it's Walter!

24:55.250 --> 24:56.640
I can see that.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.960
I'm FaceTiming. Isn't this exciting?

24:58.960 --> 25:00.720
Can I speak to Bertie, please?

25:00.720 --> 25:02.120
Glad you figured it out.

25:04.940 --> 25:07.730
Walter. It's Claude Rains.

25:07.730 --> 25:10.690
The Invisible Man. Brrr!

25:12.430 --> 25:13.410
Hi, Walter.

25:13.410 --> 25:16.320
Is that Moby? Hey, what's up, Moby?

25:16.320 --> 25:17.570
Hi, how are you?

25:18.970 --> 25:20.390
My son, please.

25:20.390 --> 25:23.340
Oh, Vivian's getting him. Walter, I have a question for you.

25:23.350 --> 25:24.840
When you shave your head,

25:24.840 --> 25:27.610
do you use a straight razor or clippers?

25:27.610 --> 25:29.340
'Cause I tried using a straight razor

25:29.340 --> 25:31.300
and I took big chunks out of my scalp

25:31.300 --> 25:32.640
and there was blood everywhere.

25:32.640 --> 25:33.900
But when I look at your scalp,

25:33.900 --> 25:35.440
I don't see any nicks or cuts.

25:35.450 --> 25:36.820
So how do you do that?

25:36.820 --> 25:38.070
I'm good with a blade.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.530
Now step away from the computer, please.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.650
Hello, Bertie.

25:47.650 --> 25:49.240
Walter Blunt.

25:50.760 --> 25:52.540
Is this the news?

25:53.305 --> 25:59.376
