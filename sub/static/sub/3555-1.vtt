03:43.849 --> 03:45.433

- (yelping)

03:58.155 --> 03:59.363
Good boy.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.243
Mother: Lili!

04:05.329 --> 04:07.622
Come on, Lili,
I'll be late.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.875
- Lili: How long is the flight?
- Mother: More than a day.

04:11.043 --> 04:13.502
- Lili: Where will you land?
- Mother: In Sydney.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.755
- Lili: And from there?
- Mother: By car.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.339

04:32.814 --> 04:34.398
Don't rip it.

06:05.157 --> 06:08.617
- Professor, please accept this.
- It's not necessary.

06:08.785 --> 06:09.910
For your daughter.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.165
I'm not a professor
anymore.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.543
- Next week then.
- Yes, well...

06:24.092 --> 06:26.385
Lili: You're at the sea
for three months?

06:26.553 --> 06:29.138
Mother: Ocean. In Australia
it's the ocean.

06:29.306 --> 06:30.848
Lili: How far
is the university?

06:31.016 --> 06:33.434
- Mother: 200 meters.
- Lili: You're so lucky.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.561
You'll be fine with Dad too.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.356
Do you have her passport?

06:41.276 --> 06:42.860
(dog whining)

06:44.696 --> 06:46.405
Thanks.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.491
Finally! Is it him?

06:48.658 --> 06:49.742
(laughs)

06:50.410 --> 06:52.578
- I'll be right back.
- Fine.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.221
(suitcase rolling)

07:14.226 --> 07:15.518
Wait, let me.

07:23.318 --> 07:24.819
Will you be home
for the concert?

07:24.986 --> 07:26.278
How?

07:27.030 --> 07:29.657
- Take good care of them.
- Them?

07:29.825 --> 07:31.951
She brought her dog too.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.329
Man: I won't have any dog.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.998
Where should I put him?

07:38.166 --> 07:41.252
- The professor will babysit it.
- You mean Hans?

07:41.711 --> 07:44.130
He'll be at the conference too.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.508
Tripping up the ladder,
are we?

07:50.137 --> 07:52.847
- Don't do this to me.
- Don't start.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.724
Come on, darling, time to go.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.524
Obey your father, OK?

08:03.692 --> 08:05.818
Three months is nothing.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.614
- (car starts)
- Mother: Take care.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.135
No kiss?

08:44.274 --> 08:45.608
I brought this for you.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.694
- What is it?
- A bubble-maker.

08:49.446 --> 08:53.115
Thanks,
but I'm not a kid anymore.

08:53.909 --> 08:56.827
- What's that on your neck?
- An access card.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.162
Lili: Can I have it?

08:59.289 --> 09:00.998
Are you chewing gum?

09:02.500 --> 09:03.500
No.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.421
Okay. Spit it out.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.535
- (beeping)
- Lili: Twenty.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.080
Father: Key button. 1965.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.462
Woman: What's this mutt doing here?

09:48.672 --> 09:50.506
Lili: Hagen...

09:50.674 --> 09:53.801
- You want to keep it here?
- For a while.

09:53.969 --> 09:57.221
Woman: How long exactly?
It can't stay here.

09:57.389 --> 10:03.060
They've posted the ruling.
Mutts have to be reported.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.187
They're making a list now.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.940
- I didn't know.
- Read the order.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.485
- Mutts have to be reported.
- I'll do just that.

10:11.653 --> 10:12.695
Thank you.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.033
Dirty pig.

10:20.412 --> 10:21.870
(sizzling)

10:26.501 --> 10:28.836
- (whimpering)
- Lili: You'll get some.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.933
Good boy.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.728
Lili, leave that dog
alone already.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.438
In here at least.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.985
Why do you
have the pass?

10:53.153 --> 10:55.112
- Where should I put it?
- Why didn't you put it back?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.865
- Where?
- You have to ask.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.158
Give it to me.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.121
Lili, this belongs here, OK?

11:15.508 --> 11:19.178
- Lili, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

11:20.764 --> 11:24.892
Lili, here you'll eat
what I cook.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.519
The dog eats dog food.

11:28.355 --> 11:33.192
- So dig in.
- I told you I'm not hungry.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.527
Fine, then go to bed.
Take the dog.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.114
(dog whimpering)

11:58.468 --> 12:00.886
Come on, put your nightgown on.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.846
Turn around then.

12:18.363 --> 12:21.323
- (dog whimpers)
- Which bed do you want, Lili?

12:21.491 --> 12:24.201
- The same one as Hagen.
- Hagen?

12:24.369 --> 12:26.829
Hagen's not sleeping
in this room.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.664
- Why?
- He's a dog,

12:28.832 --> 12:30.749
and I'm not
sleeping with dogs.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.793
Come on. Out!

12:36.840 --> 12:38.132
Father: We're leaving now.

12:38.299 --> 12:41.677

13:02.866 --> 13:05.325
When will he stop?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.619
He's not used to being alone.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.040
(whining, yelping continues)

13:14.961 --> 13:16.378
I can't sleep.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.601
- Where are you off to?
- I have to pee.

13:30.768 --> 13:34.396
Don't go to him.
He'll stop. Please stay here.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.733

Canine control.
About the dog.

Pardon me?

being bitten by your dog.

I don't own a dog.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.552
What's that then?

15:29.262 --> 15:32.180
It's an elephant,
can't you see?

15:33.474 --> 15:36.268
Sir, this is a
mixed-breed street dog.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.562
It's not a Hungarian breed.
You have to pay a tax.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.314
Would you like to pay now
or by postal order?

15:40.481 --> 15:44.026
I'll never own a dog.
The dog belongs to my ex-wife.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.320
I'm not paying anyone for it.

15:46.487 --> 15:47.988
My ex-wife doesn't live with me,

15:48.156 --> 15:49.615
so neither do her dog
and its fleas!

15:49.782 --> 15:51.408
Dogcatcher:
It's a street mixed-breed.

15:51.576 --> 15:54.036
- It's subject to a fee.
- What if I don't pay?

15:54.203 --> 15:55.871
Dogcatcher: The dog can go
to an animal shelter.

15:56.039 --> 15:58.332

be here next time.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.002

16:15.600 --> 16:18.268
Get dressed. I'll shower

23:35.331 --> 23:39.334
You want me to throw it out?
Put it out on the street here?

23:40.294 --> 23:43.296
Is that what you want?
Let's hear it, kid!

23:45.841 --> 23:48.968

27:04.957 --> 27:06.416
You want to be sick?

27:09.837 --> 27:13.339

Beatrix?

- Trixi.

53:59.653 --> 54:01.946
Wipe off your lipstick.

54:02.865 --> 54:05.617
Trumpet players

54:06.243 --> 54:09.996
So, what is Tannhäuser about?

54:12.875 --> 54:13.958
Lili.

54:14.209 --> 54:16.002
- Who cares?
- Pardon me?

54:16.170 --> 54:19.380
You want to teach us to
tell lies or play the trumpet?

54:20.382 --> 54:22.800
Tannhäuser is about love,

54:22.968 --> 54:25.094
but you wouldn't understand,
because you're heartless.

- Hello?
- (rattling)

58:58.327 --> 59:01.746
- You can't come in here.
- Is this the dog pound?

59:01.914 --> 59:05.833
- It's not adoption day.
- May I see if my dog's here?

59:06.001 --> 59:08.419
- Why, where is it?
- I don't know.

59:08.587 --> 59:10.671
It's where you put it,
probably.

59:10.839 --> 59:12.590
He disappeared.

59:12.758 --> 59:14.383
- Disappeared?
- Yes.

59:14.551 --> 59:15.801
Okay, come here!

59:21.141 --> 59:22.433
Don't you lie to me, kid.

59:22.601 --> 59:24.352
I'm not.
My dad threw him out.

59:24.519 --> 59:27.521
And you helped, right?
What kind of dog?

59:28.774 --> 59:31.484
This is him.
Can I see if he's here?

59:31.652 --> 59:33.653
I can't see without my glasses.

59:33.820 --> 59:36.739
Is it a Labrador,
or a Shar Pei

59:36.907 --> 59:42.870
- No, mixed breed.
- Oh, of course, not purebred.

59:43.038 --> 59:46.457
Well, you threw him out
in the garbage, obviously.

59:47.459 --> 59:49.835
- When did he disappear?
- Weeks ago.

59:50.003 --> 59:52.004
Then you've got no dog.

59:52.172 --> 59:54.966
If it's out for weeks,
there's no hope.

59:55.133 --> 59:57.802
Either it's lost,
or got hit by a car,

59:57.970 --> 01:00:01.013
- or ended up in the Danube.
- Or you put them down!

01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:05.226
No, people spread lies.
We don't put them down here.

01:00:05.394 --> 01:00:06.644
You kill them!

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:12.441

- Blowing fags like you in jail.

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:39.927

You've never touched a dog,
only cash.

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:48.412
This isn't even a dog.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.748

- How much for the dog?
- He's not for sale.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:45.047
- There's always a price.
- Uh-huh, sure.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:47.466
Not for you.
You fucked me over.

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:50.427
When I was dirty, you shunned me,
but now you don't?

01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:53.305
It's not you.
It's the dog I want.

- Man: Calm down! Stop shouting!

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:12.866

He's my dog!
