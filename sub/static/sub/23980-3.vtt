00:25.240 --> 00:28.880
Hi, Anna. Thanks for taking
Charlie to the party.

00:28.920 --> 00:33.080
How was it? Rowdy. You know
how unbearable some children can be.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.320
Mum! Look what I won at the party!
The others are losers!

00:36.360 --> 00:39.160
I won the ugly face competition.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.880
The words every proud mother
loves to hear

00:41.920 --> 00:45.440
Though, to be fair, I think
your dad takes the credit.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.520
I want the keyring! You can't!
I won it, Jack.

00:48.560 --> 00:54.160
It's not fair! I wanted one!
Well, tough! Cos you're a loser!

00:54.200 --> 00:57.120
Loser, loser, loser, loser!
Kids, eh?

00:57.160 --> 01:00.760
Can't live with them... You've got
no bloody choice though, have you?

01:00.800 --> 01:04.000
At least when they're fully grown,
we can harvest their organs.

01:05.720 --> 01:08.280
So, um, any plans for the weekend?

01:08.320 --> 01:13.200
Yes, Toby and I are having our usual
romantic Saturday date night.?

01:13.240 --> 01:14.680
Our therapist seems to think

01:14.720 --> 01:17.560
if we go through the motions
of having a loving relationship,

01:17.600 --> 01:20.320
we might be able to trick our brains
into thinking it's real

01:20.360 --> 01:24.880
and achieve some sort of
emotional connection. Well, it only
takes a spark to light a bonfire.

01:24.920 --> 01:29.000
Yes, I have thought about that,
but Jack would miss him.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.440
So, every Saturday,
we send Jack on a sleepover.

01:31.480 --> 01:35.560
Toby and I go to a restaurant
together, drink enough wine

01:35.600 --> 01:39.560
to float a small frigate
and then we attempt to have sex.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.600
Don't the waiters mind?

01:41.640 --> 01:46.920
I'm not convinced about the whole
idea, but I'm making the effort.

01:46.960 --> 01:52.000
We try to go for a different style
every week. The food, not the...

01:52.040 --> 01:54.920
I won the keyring!
I won the keyring!

01:54.960 --> 01:59.240
I hate you! Jack! You know
that hate is a Mummy and Daddy word.

02:07.760 --> 02:11.880
Do you mind?
Some old lady's about to find out
her priceless Ming vase

02:11.920 --> 02:13.280
is actually from Poundland.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.240
I can't find it anywhere.
This is awful.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.040
What?

02:20.080 --> 02:22.280
Charlie's keyring that
he won at the party.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.600
I think Jack stole it.

02:26.640 --> 02:27.800
Are you sure?

02:27.840 --> 02:30.240
Well, I've looked everywhere
and there's no sign of it.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.480
And Jack really wanted one.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.400
Maybe Charlie gave it to him.

02:34.440 --> 02:36.080
Charlie?

02:36.120 --> 02:37.680
Our Charlie?

02:37.720 --> 02:39.840
Giving away his competition prize?

02:39.880 --> 02:42.800
All right,
maybe Charlie sold it to him.

02:42.840 --> 02:46.040
He didn't give it to him.
He's really upset it's gone missing.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.320
Has Jack nicked things before?

02:48.360 --> 02:52.120
Not that I know of. But there was
that Furby that vanished recently.
The what?

02:52.160 --> 02:55.200
You know, that little bright pink
toy that makes funny noises.

02:55.240 --> 02:59.240
One eye missing, smells funny, ear
hanging off. Are you sure it didn't
just kill itself?

03:00.480 --> 03:03.760
You can't start blaming Jack
for everything that goes missing.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.200
OK, fine.
I can't prove he stole the Furby,

03:06.240 --> 03:09.320
but I'm sure he did steal
the keyring. All right.

03:09.360 --> 03:13.160
If you tell me he stole the keyring,
he stole the keyring. Good.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.240
Well? Well, that's sorted then,
isn't it?

03:19.280 --> 03:22.520
You can stop looking for it.
Is that it?

03:22.560 --> 03:25.160
Well, I could phone CID,
but I think they're still working

03:25.200 --> 03:28.000
full time on the "who left
the lid off the toothpaste" case.

03:32.360 --> 03:35.000
All right.
What do you want to do about it?

03:35.040 --> 03:40.080
Go round and tell Anna and Toby.
You're not serious!
It'll be fine, they're our friends.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.880
Exactly. And when there's a problem
between friends, you're supposed to
do the adult thing.

03:43.920 --> 03:47.520
Don't mention it,
resent them for a few weeks,
and hope the whole thing goes away.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.040
I really think we should say
something. For Jack's sake too.

03:51.080 --> 03:54.880
He needs to learn that stealing
is wrong. What if one day
he ends up locked up in jail?

03:54.920 --> 03:58.840
Well, then, stealing big keyrings
will be a useful skill to have.

03:58.880 --> 04:02.200
OK, maybe Anna and Toby
ought to know about this.

04:02.240 --> 04:06.720
Going round there is probably
the right thing to do. Thank you.

04:06.760 --> 04:10.400
Good luck.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.000
We're both going.
I need your back-up. Trust me.

04:15.040 --> 04:16.800
You've got my back up.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.440
Hi!

04:31.480 --> 04:34.760
Hello. This is a surprise.
Just passing.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.520
- It's not fair!
- Stop shouting!

04:37.560 --> 04:39.680
- No!
- Do not speak to me like that!

04:39.720 --> 04:42.360
I hope we're not interrupting
anything. Not at all.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.720
You are in BIG trouble now, Jack!
Jack, look, Lee and Lucy are here.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.960
Hello. I'm sorry if you heard
our little contretemps.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.640
No. Not really.

04:53.680 --> 04:56.760
Yeah, couldn't hear anything over
all that screaming.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.760
We weren't expecting you.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.520
Well, there was something
I wanted to talk to you about.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.680
In fact, we both wanted to,
didn't we, Lee?

05:04.840 --> 05:06.520
Yes.

05:09.400 --> 05:13.040
Are we just going to stand around,
looking at each other awkwardly?

05:13.080 --> 05:14.960
I get enough of that
on our date night.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.880
Date night?
Is that one of those kinky ones

05:18.920 --> 05:22.160
when you fantasise you've
never met each other? No.

05:23.160 --> 05:25.360
That is a fantasy
I have quite often though.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.280
Remember that toy keyring that
Charlie won at the party?

05:31.320 --> 05:34.480
Well, after you left, he couldn't
find it and I remembered that

05:34.520 --> 05:40.000
Jack really wanted one and
so we wondered if Jack had taken it.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.200
I see.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.760
Well, I'm glad you came
round and told us.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.240
I'd have hated for you not
to have said anything.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.680
I knew you would.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.760
But just to let you know,
he didn't take it.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.480
Charlie probably put it down
somewhere and lost it.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.240
It's easily done in the mess of...

06:00.800 --> 06:03.320
..people's houses.

06:03.360 --> 06:06.240
To be fair, Anna, we can't be
certain that Jack didn't take it.

06:06.280 --> 06:10.120
Right. Well, there's a very simple
way to settle this.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.240
Jack, will you come downstairs,
please?

06:16.080 --> 06:18.880
What?
Can you come and sit down, Jack?

06:18.920 --> 06:21.640
We just want to ask you
a few questions.

06:21.680 --> 06:22.920
Nothing to worry about.

06:32.080 --> 06:35.000
Jack, when you were at
Lucy's house earlier,

06:35.040 --> 06:38.640
did you take Charlie's toy keyring?
No.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.160
Scout's honour? Yes.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.680
Right.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.600
Well, good.

06:44.640 --> 06:49.120
Wow! That was like watching
Michael Madsen cut that bloke's ear
off in Reservoir Dogs.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.400
Yes, Toby.
Let's do this properly, shall we?

06:52.520 --> 06:54.320
Turn out your pockets, please.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.960
Mum... Do it.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.840
There you go. No keyring.
Yeah, but he could have put it
somewhere else.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.200
Shall I fetch a rubber glove
from the kitchen?

07:12.320 --> 07:14.320
You can go now, Jack.

07:19.680 --> 07:23.240
Glad to have put your minds at rest.
It is possible he's not telling
the truth, Anna.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.240
So now he's a liar and a thief?

07:25.280 --> 07:28.000
No, but perhaps he told you what
he thought you wanted to hear to

07:28.040 --> 07:31.400
avoid getting into trouble. We don't
do that in our house, do we, Toby?

07:31.440 --> 07:33.480
Absolutely not, darling.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.040
Jack knows the meaning of the words
right and wrong

07:36.080 --> 07:38.160
and that makes him an honest boy.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.840
Well, I know the meaning of the word
ecclesiastical, doesn't make me a...

07:44.040 --> 07:47.680
Perhaps you should have gone
with a word you do actually
know the meaning of.

07:47.720 --> 07:51.600
I don't know if you noticed,
but Jack and I were having
a disagreement when you came in.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.120
Do you know why?
Because I wasn't available?

07:56.680 --> 07:59.600
Because ever since we left
your house, he's been going on

07:59.640 --> 08:02.440
and on about wanting one of those
ridiculous little keyrings.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.240
Do you really think he'd be doing
that if he'd stolen Charlie's?

08:05.280 --> 08:06.560
Right.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.560
Well, I didn't realise that.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.120
Clearly.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.520
So, is there anything else
we can help you with?

08:15.960 --> 08:18.600
Look, I think we should put all
this behind us and move on.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.640
What do you say, Anna? I don't know.

08:20.680 --> 08:22.600
What do you say to people
who've made

08:22.640 --> 08:26.160
allegations against your family?
"See you later, allegators?"

08:29.360 --> 08:32.120
Is now a good time to mention
the pink Furby? Bye.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.039
Kids? We're leaving in ten minutes.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.560
Make sure you've got your costumes
and armbands.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.160
Swimming lessons?
No, Hitler Youth rally.

08:51.880 --> 08:56.320
Yes, swimming lessons.
Are you still looking for that
keyring? It's not here.

08:56.360 --> 09:01.000
Jack definitely stole it.
You've changed your tune. Well,
you didn't see the look he gave me.

09:01.040 --> 09:05.440
He looked so guilty. He's a boy.
They have a permanent look of guilt.

09:05.480 --> 09:07.120
He's in training for being a man.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.440
But like Anna said,
if he'd have stolen it, why would

09:11.480 --> 09:14.320
he still be acting all moody
and begging her to buy him one?

09:14.360 --> 09:18.120
Exactly! Acting!
He was putting on a performance.
I find that hard to believe.

09:18.160 --> 09:22.920
I know how the mind
of an eight-year-old boy works.
I find that easier to believe.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.720
Look, I know it was my idea to go
round there in the first place,

09:25.760 --> 09:29.000
but I think I got it wrong.
All right, then.
So, where's the keyring?

09:29.040 --> 09:32.680
I don't know, but I don't think
Jack's got it. In fact, I think
we should stop at Anna

09:32.720 --> 09:35.280
and Toby's on the way to swimming
and apologise.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.880
You're coming, too.

09:36.920 --> 09:41.080
No chance! In the words of Molly's
favourite song, let it go!

09:41.120 --> 09:44.400
And in the words of my favourite
song, that kid's for hanging,

09:44.440 --> 09:48.320
he took what's ours,
and we're gonna make him pay...by...

09:48.360 --> 09:50.760
Are you making this up? Yeah.

09:59.160 --> 10:02.160
Don't tell me. You're back
and this time you have a warrant.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.440
We've come round to say we're sorry,
Anna.

10:06.480 --> 10:09.200
We shouldn't have made accusations.
Should we, Lee?

10:09.240 --> 10:13.440
No. I should never have called
Jack a juvenile delinquent.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.880
You didn't.
I know, I should never have said
he should be locked up in borstal.

10:16.920 --> 10:21.080
You didn't say that either.
And I definitely shouldn't have said
that Anna is a self-righteous...

10:21.120 --> 10:22.760
Yes, thank you, Lee.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.600
Speak of "the devil".

10:29.640 --> 10:32.440
Well, thank you for coming round
to clear the air.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.760
Yes, it was very gracious of you
both to accept you were

10:35.800 --> 10:38.280
completely and utterly in the wrong.

10:38.320 --> 10:42.320
Perhaps I should go upstairs
and apologise to Jack in person.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.720
There's no need to do that.

10:43.760 --> 10:47.520
Yeah, and we've got to go, the kids
are in the car, we've got swimming.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.600
Actually, could I just
use your toilet before we go?

10:50.640 --> 10:52.600
Can't you wait
until we're at the pool?

10:55.160 --> 10:58.080
They've got a chemical that makes
the water turn blue.

10:58.120 --> 11:01.000
We're going to be late.
Well, I'll meet you there.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.760
OK. Bye.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.680
And sorry again.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.240
The toilet's just there.

11:10.280 --> 11:13.600
Right, well, you might want to turn
the radio up nice and loud then.

11:16.640 --> 11:19.520
Or use a different toilet.
Probably for the best.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.560
After all,
we have just cleared the air.

11:23.640 --> 11:26.320
Where is it?
At the train station down the road.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.160
It's upstairs.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.360
I'm just looking for the bathroom.
It's there.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.040
That your bedroom, is it?
What do YOU think?

11:52.080 --> 11:56.200
Would my mum have a sign
on her bedroom door that says
"Danger! Toxic!"?

11:58.680 --> 12:00.800
Well? Are you going to
the bathroom or not?

12:58.600 --> 12:59.840
Gotcha!

13:04.080 --> 13:06.320
Don't leave your swimming
stuff in your bags.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.520
It'll go all stale and mouldy!

13:08.560 --> 13:10.160
That's how we grew your father.

13:11.320 --> 13:14.640
You're here.
Why didn't you come swimming?

13:14.680 --> 13:19.400
Because I was so weighed down
with my newfound knowledge,
I thought I might drown.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.520
I've got something to show you.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.640
Actually,
I've got something to show you.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.560
Charlie put his coat on
after swimming

13:27.600 --> 13:29.480
and guess what fell
out of the sleeve.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.000
So, it's a good job
we apologised to Anna.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.280
Turned out Jack didn't steal
it after all.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.720
Hi, Anna.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.640
Come in.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.080
Everything OK? It's a bit awkward.
Actually, it's about that keyring.

13:56.120 --> 13:59.760
Jack's been complaining non-stop
about not having one

13:59.800 --> 14:02.320
and I did what every parent
shouldn't do.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.800
I gave in.

14:03.840 --> 14:08.480
So, first thing this morning,
just before you two came round to

14:08.520 --> 14:13.560
apologise, I popped out and bought
Jack the identical keyring.

14:14.640 --> 14:18.840
Right. Well, the thing is,
it's now suddenly disappeared.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.600
And?

14:20.640 --> 14:24.520
Well, Jack's keyring went missing
just after Lee had gone

14:24.560 --> 14:25.960
upstairs to use the toilet.

14:27.680 --> 14:30.560
I think the two might be related.
Are you sure?

14:30.600 --> 14:32.720
You didn't know Lee
when you got pregnant.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.680
If Lee had seen the keyring,
he would, of course,

14:36.720 --> 14:38.640
have assumed it to be Charlie's.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.720
Hang on, are you saying Lee
stole Jack's toy keyring?

14:41.760 --> 14:43.600
Well...

14:43.640 --> 14:45.280
Yes, I am saying that.

14:45.320 --> 14:49.320
You're saying your child's toy
was stolen by my husband? Yes.

14:49.360 --> 14:51.240
A grown adult?

14:51.280 --> 14:53.200
I didn't say that bit.

14:54.520 --> 14:58.360
This is ridiculous.
Lee did go upstairs at our house.
Yeah, but to use the toilet.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.200
But he didn't use the toilet.
I went in there afterwards

15:01.240 --> 15:05.280
and the brand new bar of soap
hadn't been touched.
Trust me, that proves nothing.

15:06.920 --> 15:09.680
OK, well,
there's a simple way to settle this.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.560
Lee, can you come down here, please?

15:16.240 --> 15:20.120
What? It's OK. We just wanted
to ask you a few questions.

15:20.160 --> 15:23.640
Lee, when we were at Anna's earlier,
did you take Jack's toy keyring?

15:23.680 --> 15:25.760
No.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.200
Do you promise?

15:27.240 --> 15:28.760
Yes.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.400
Turn out your pockets, please.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.960
Do it.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.640
Do you want to frisk him,
or shall I?

15:42.680 --> 15:45.600
Let's not argue, girls.
Why don't you both do it?

15:45.640 --> 15:48.760
No, thank you.
My vaccinations aren't up to date.

15:48.800 --> 15:52.560
Look, Jack just probably put it
down somewhere and forgot about it.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.040
Easily done in the mess
of some people's houses.

15:56.120 --> 16:00.520
I've stripped Jack's bedroom,
the playroom, it's definitely gone.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.840
Well, it's not here.

16:01.880 --> 16:04.360
Right. Well,

16:04.400 --> 16:06.600
I suppose there's not much
more to discuss.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.040
She's got a nerve.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.280
Making accusations like that.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.200
Typical Anna.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.760
What did you do that for? Because
I haven't got a baseball bat.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.880
What have you done with it?
Done with what? You know what.

16:28.920 --> 16:32.120
What have you done with the one
of these you stole from Jack?

16:32.160 --> 16:34.960
He probably just lost it,
like you said.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.960
Quite easy with
the state of his bedroom.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.400
I would have thought.
All right, yes, I did nick it

16:41.440 --> 16:43.760
and I've just stashed it
in my sock drawer.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.120
How was I to know Anna was going
to buy him another one?

16:46.160 --> 16:49.160
No, naturally you assumed the one
Charlie won was a one-off

16:49.200 --> 16:52.560
bespoke and handcrafted piece.
Why did you steal it back, anyway?

16:52.600 --> 16:55.960
Why didn't you just tell Anna
and Toby you found it
when you were there?

16:56.000 --> 16:59.480
Because I thought you would want
to share in the righteous glory.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.400
I thought I was doing the right
thing, Lucy. Of course you did.

17:02.440 --> 17:05.359
Because stealing toys
from an eight-year-old's bedroom is

17:05.400 --> 17:08.000
the kind of thing we're encouraged
to do in the Bible!

17:08.040 --> 17:11.359
You could at least have used
the toilet while you were there.
I might be a thief,

17:11.400 --> 17:16.480
but I'm not the kind of weird thief
that does a dump in the house.
Are you going to tell on me?

17:16.520 --> 17:21.040
Trust me, I'd be more than happy
to, but not now I've just lied
and told them you didn't steal it.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.680
I know. What about this?

17:22.720 --> 17:26.560
We go round,
say we're just passing by... Again?

17:26.599 --> 17:29.440
You do realise
they live in a cul de sac?

17:29.480 --> 17:34.720
Where exactly are we supposed to be
heading every time we're passing by?
I go upstairs, again,

17:34.760 --> 17:38.760
and I sneak the keyring back
in Jack's bedroom where I found it.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.160
It's a no brainer.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.480
Finally, some self-awareness.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.560
To start with,
I don't think they'll ever let you

17:45.600 --> 17:48.320
upstairs in their house again,
and even if they did, imagine

17:48.360 --> 17:51.200
if you went up to the toilet
and the keyring suddenly appears.

17:51.240 --> 17:54.480
What would that look like?
A very disgusting magic trick?

17:54.520 --> 17:58.120
All right. We'll just put it in any
room. They'll never prove it was us.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.520
If that keyring appeared after
we'd been there, they'd know.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.680
And we'd know they knew.
And they'd know we knew they knew.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.520
And we'd know that.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.000
We'd all understand what
was going on perfectly.

18:09.040 --> 18:12.920
Not all of us.
If we want to sneak that keyring
back in to the house,

18:12.960 --> 18:16.160
we'll have to do it without anyone
ever knowing we were there.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.160
How?

18:18.200 --> 18:21.000
It's Anna and Toby's romantic
date night tonight.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.440
Jack's at a sleepover.

18:23.480 --> 18:25.520
The house is empty.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.640
Let me get this straight.

18:27.680 --> 18:31.440
We are going to prove that we
are not thieves by sneaking

18:31.480 --> 18:34.280
round in the dead of night
and breaking into their house.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.640
We don't have to break in.

18:35.680 --> 18:39.680
I know for a fact that Anna hides
the spare key under the wheelie bin.

18:39.720 --> 18:43.760
Do you know the code? The alarm
code? No, Lucy. The dress code!

18:43.800 --> 18:47.080
I was thinking black and white
stripes, with a big swag bag.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.760
I've been and out of that house
with Anna loads of times

18:49.800 --> 18:53.360
and she never sets the alarm.
I'll phone Mum and see
if she can babysit.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.920
Well, tell her we'll be back in two
to three years with good behaviour.

19:06.080 --> 19:10.480
Where are you going?
Putting it back in Jack's bedroom,
behind the photo, where I found it.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.400
But Anna said she's already searched
Jack's room, from top to bottom.

19:13.440 --> 19:15.680
She'll know someone put it
back there.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.560
We might as well leave a Parcelforce
card, saying, we called,

19:18.600 --> 19:22.320
you were out,
so we broke into your house.
So, where am I supposed to put it?

19:22.360 --> 19:24.360
Where she definitely
hasn't searched.

19:24.400 --> 19:27.120
Where did Anna say she'd looked?
In Jack's bedroom, playroom.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.880
Exactly, all the fun places,
where Jack would have had it.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.480
But where does the least
amount of fun happen?

19:32.520 --> 19:34.040
Anna and Toby's bedroom?

19:34.080 --> 19:36.560
Exactly.

19:36.600 --> 19:37.880
That was actually a joke.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.640
Don't put the light on!

19:44.680 --> 19:47.440
It'll look like they've
got burglars.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.680
- Yeah.
- That's much less suspicious

19:49.720 --> 19:53.640
The neighbours will just think
they've ordered some Milk Tray.

19:53.680 --> 19:57.240
See? You wouldn't expect to find
toys in here, would you?

19:57.280 --> 19:59.360
I hope to God we don't.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.560
So, where are we going to plant it,
then?

20:03.600 --> 20:05.360
In the wardrobe?

20:05.400 --> 20:08.360
No, I don't really want
to open the wardrobe.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.160
Got this horrible feeling I'm going
to find Anna hanging

20:11.200 --> 20:14.400
upside down with her arms
folded across her chest.

20:14.440 --> 20:17.160
Well, where, then?
Under the bed?

20:17.200 --> 20:18.920
Anywhere! Can we just go, please?

20:21.520 --> 20:23.000
Perfect.

20:25.080 --> 20:28.240
Congratulations, Toby,
on ruining yet another date night.

20:28.280 --> 20:31.000
I didn't ruin it, Anna,
I merely voiced an opinion.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.040
Yes, an opposite opinion to mine.

20:37.280 --> 20:40.080
I just don't think there was any
need for you to go round to Lee

20:40.120 --> 20:42.560
and Lucy's house
and to accuse them of stealing.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.880
No. That's right.

20:45.920 --> 20:49.200
Your advice was to do absolutely
nothing whatsoever, as usual.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.480
I know. We'll get a gun.
Don't be facetious.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.520
It's not to stop people
stealing stuff.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.320
I promised I'd never divorce you,

20:59.360 --> 21:01.440
so I need to find other
exit strategies.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.400
Is it me, or is it cold in here?

21:05.440 --> 21:07.360
Can I choose both?

21:09.280 --> 21:12.200
It should have been you going round
to their house, not me.

21:16.240 --> 21:20.000
Why can't you handle confrontation?
I can.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.720
I just don't need to go round
to their house to get it.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.680
I just wish you'd grow a pair.

21:28.720 --> 21:32.000
I'm too busy growing apples to help
you poison the Seven Dwarves.

21:34.320 --> 21:37.080
Hang on.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.800
What's that?

21:38.840 --> 21:40.600
What?

21:40.640 --> 21:42.280
Under the bed.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.120
Well, well, well.
What do we have here?

21:51.160 --> 21:54.720
God!
So, Lee didn't steal it after all.

21:54.760 --> 21:56.240
Seems you owe him an apology.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.920
I knew you'd misjudged him.

22:00.960 --> 22:05.120
He's not the kind of person who'd
snoop round people's bedrooms.

22:05.160 --> 22:08.080
In fact, I think
you owe them both an apology.
Well, it's a bit late now.

22:08.120 --> 22:12.120
They'll probably be in bed.
I'll do it in the morning.

22:13.160 --> 22:17.200
And I think I owe you
an apology too, Toby.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.960
Wow, that's...unprecedented.

22:21.640 --> 22:25.720
I'm sorry date night
ended so quickly.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.160
Yeah,
we didn't even finish our starters.

22:28.200 --> 22:32.720
Well,
maybe date night hasn't ended yet.

22:32.760 --> 22:36.640
Maybe there's still
time for a little bit...more.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.520
OK, well, why don't
I slip out of this shirt and jacket,

22:43.560 --> 22:46.720
put on something more comfortable,
jump in the car and go get us

22:46.760 --> 22:48.600
both a takeaway?

22:49.800 --> 22:51.680
I'm talking about sex.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.600
Right, well,
if that's what you want.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.600
It's not a question
of what I want, Toby.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.680
But why pay a therapist all that
money and not follow her advice?

23:02.720 --> 23:06.000
It would be like hiring an au pair
and then doing your own ironing.

23:07.080 --> 23:10.680
OK, then.
Let's...crumple some garments.

23:25.480 --> 23:28.840
Do we have to have the music?

23:28.880 --> 23:30.960
You know I can't get there
without Buble.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.360
Is that good?.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.440
Buble?.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.200
There? There.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.960
There? There.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.440
Yeah? Yeah.

23:52.480 --> 23:55.400
Yeah? Yeah.
Happy with that? No, Toby.

23:55.440 --> 23:58.360
No, no. Yeah.
Yeah?.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.040
Yeah? Yes.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.560
Bright pink. One eye missing.

24:05.600 --> 24:08.120
Our Furby! Jack did steal it!

24:09.600 --> 24:11.960
Who cares?

24:18.240 --> 24:21.000
I'm not keeping you awake,
am I, Toby?

24:21.040 --> 24:24.440
What? Never mind.
Carry on doing what you were doing.

24:24.480 --> 24:28.280
With the same frequency,
or with more frantic oscillations?

24:29.480 --> 24:31.440
You were doing fine.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.560
Fine? I'm glad you're enjoying it.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.640
If you wouldn't mind filling
in a short survey afterwards.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.760
Wake up!

24:45.760 --> 24:49.520
Happy? Yep. Yeah? Yeah.

24:51.840 --> 24:54.360
Wake up!

25:24.400 --> 25:29.720
See? Jack is a thief. You two must
be feeling pretty embarrassed now.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.560
Well, that was a bit awkward.

25:44.680 --> 25:47.320
A bit awkward is trying to hug
someone who only wants

25:47.360 --> 25:49.080
to shake your hand.

25:49.120 --> 25:53.920
Not breaking into your friends'
house, hiding under their bed
and listening to them having sex.

25:53.960 --> 25:56.720
All right, a bit illegal.

25:56.760 --> 25:59.400
Well, hopefully, they'll forgive us.

25:59.440 --> 26:03.720
Especially since we proved Jack
is a thief. Yeah, hopefully.

26:03.760 --> 26:07.160
For all we know, they're planning
revenge and hiding under OUR bed.

26:09.680 --> 26:12.520
They're not there,
I've already checked.

26:14.680 --> 26:19.280
So, it's safe if me and you want
to have a bit of... Wow.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.480
I'm humiliated and you're horny.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.880
Well, that's the introductions
out of the way.

26:25.920 --> 26:30.760
Well. At least we now know that
everyone's child has got the correct
toy keyring.

26:30.800 --> 26:34.360
Yeah, suppose. Can you pass me
your phone, so I can text Anna

26:34.400 --> 26:37.720
and say we'll pop round tomorrow
and apologise properly?

26:37.760 --> 26:40.560
And, hopefully, we can put all
this theft talk behind us.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.600
Hang on. What's this?

26:53.400 --> 26:56.160
I've come away with Anna's knickers
by mistake. God!

26:58.480 --> 27:00.560
Don't worry. I've got a plan.
