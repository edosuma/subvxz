00:09.233 --> 00:12.233
(gentle rock music)

02:06.785 --> 02:09.868
(intense rock music)

03:14.875 --> 03:19.875
(baby crying)
(intense rock music)

03:58.621 --> 04:01.371
(dramatic music)

04:16.730 --> 04:18.720
- Was Ryan only dating me

04:18.720 --> 04:20.870
just because he wanted
to have sex with me?

04:24.971 --> 04:26.663
Did he cheat on me?

04:31.890 --> 04:34.983
Great, this is great, love that.

04:36.030 --> 04:38.730
What was the name of the
person he cheated on me with?

04:42.860 --> 04:46.790
No, no, no, no, no, no, I need a name.

04:46.790 --> 04:49.533
What is the name of the
person he cheated on me with?

04:53.440 --> 04:57.130
No, first it's my boyfriend, then my dad,

04:57.130 --> 04:57.983
and now you.

04:58.930 --> 05:00.893
I'm surrounded by assholes.

05:06.760 --> 05:10.723
If my mom could've said
anything to me before she died,

05:11.610 --> 05:12.860
what would she have said?

05:16.790 --> 05:18.420
Why am I wasting my time

05:18.420 --> 05:21.057
talking to this fucking
piece of cardboard?

05:30.216 --> 05:31.049
A,

05:32.065 --> 05:32.898
T,

05:36.334 --> 05:37.167
T,

05:39.733 --> 05:40.566
I,

05:44.016 --> 05:44.849
C,

05:47.093 --> 05:47.926
attic.

05:49.995 --> 05:51.078
Attic, attic.

05:55.029 --> 05:57.696
(ominous music)

06:37.970 --> 06:41.290
- [Mother] Alexis, your father
and I are beside ourselves

06:41.290 --> 06:43.595
with anticipation to meet you,

06:43.595 --> 06:45.431
our unborn child.

06:45.431 --> 06:47.413
You are scheduled to arrive in two days

06:47.413 --> 06:49.010
and you are all we can
think or talk about.

06:49.010 --> 06:51.733
We want only the best for you.

06:51.733 --> 06:53.690
We will do everything within
our power collectively

06:53.690 --> 06:54.523
to provide it.

06:55.454 --> 06:57.584
We love you with all of our hearts

06:57.584 --> 06:59.250
and can't wait to meet you.

06:59.250 --> 07:00.757
Love, mom and dad.

07:00.757 --> 07:03.424
(ominous music)

07:08.502 --> 07:10.585
(crying)

07:15.936 --> 07:17.186
- [Alexis] Why?

07:19.582 --> 07:22.249
(ominous music)

07:53.937 --> 07:56.270
(screaming)

08:03.663 --> 08:06.663
(breathing heavily)

08:24.365 --> 08:27.032
(ominous music)

08:31.077 --> 08:33.313
- Move along, Alexis.

08:33.313 --> 08:37.313
You don't want to be late
for class now, do you?

08:38.544 --> 08:41.211
(ominous music)

09:07.397 --> 09:10.947
For your sin, he will take something away

09:12.357 --> 09:15.720
and you will suffer greatly day after day.

09:19.296 --> 09:20.600
The height of your suffering

09:20.600 --> 09:22.893
will be given back tenfold.

09:24.340 --> 09:26.120
This is what is written,

09:27.772 --> 09:29.772
the story has been told.

09:30.976 --> 09:33.643
(door creaking)

09:38.016 --> 09:40.349
Hold still for him, my dear.

09:43.148 --> 09:45.815
(ominous music)

09:46.917 --> 09:49.167
(growling)

09:53.360 --> 09:55.693
(screaming)

09:59.564 --> 10:02.302
(coughing)

10:02.302 --> 10:04.105
(crying)

10:04.105 --> 10:06.772
(ominous music)

10:16.350 --> 10:17.183
- Alexis!

10:18.689 --> 10:19.522
Alexis!

10:20.633 --> 10:21.466
Alexis!

10:22.846 --> 10:24.489
Alexis!

10:24.489 --> 10:25.322
Alexis!

10:26.632 --> 10:27.465
Alexis!

10:30.873 --> 10:31.706
Alexis?

10:33.113 --> 10:33.946
Alexis!

10:35.412 --> 10:36.662
Alexis, Alexis.

10:38.819 --> 10:41.319
Alexis, no, no, no Alexis, no.

10:44.334 --> 10:47.001
(ominous music)

10:58.380 --> 11:01.343
Now remember, there's
nothing to be afraid of.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.690
All they're gonna do
is just run some tests

11:04.690 --> 11:06.050
and see what's wrong

11:07.050 --> 11:08.400
and I hope you feel better.

11:09.310 --> 11:12.010
- The image we'll be able
to obtain from the MRI

11:12.010 --> 11:13.410
will give us better insight

11:13.410 --> 11:15.586
for what's going on inside

11:15.586 --> 11:18.500
and hopefully some answers.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.220
Now I'll be in the room
with you the entire time

11:21.220 --> 11:23.010
and your dad'll be in the next room.

11:23.010 --> 11:27.630
So if you feel any tension,
discomfort or claustrophobia,

11:27.630 --> 11:30.613
wave your hand and I'll bring
you right back out, okay?

11:32.334 --> 11:37.334
(ominous music)
(machine beeping)

11:56.500 --> 11:58.770
From what I've been able to see,

11:58.770 --> 12:01.710
everything has healed nicely.

12:01.710 --> 12:06.630
There are no physical
deformities or shortcomings

12:06.630 --> 12:08.873
that are preventing the ability to speak.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.230
Now it's not unheard of

12:12.747 --> 12:16.440
after a traumatic event
or a series of events

12:16.440 --> 12:19.920
that a triggering loss
of certain faculties,

12:19.920 --> 12:22.330
speech being most common,

12:22.330 --> 12:25.112
that leads us to the next probable place

12:25.112 --> 12:28.243
that could be the cause of your condition.

12:29.510 --> 12:33.290
I'm going to refer you
to an esteemed colleague

12:33.290 --> 12:36.733
and friend of mine, Dr. Dawson,

12:37.651 --> 12:39.790
a state top psychiatrist.

12:39.790 --> 12:42.970
If what's preventing your ability to speak

12:42.970 --> 12:46.060
is mental more than physical,

12:46.060 --> 12:48.470
hopefully she can get to the bottom of it.

12:48.470 --> 12:50.420
- Thanks doc, I really appreciate this.

12:51.470 --> 12:54.053
(upbeat music)

13:03.150 --> 13:07.015
- Hey, I know you're
not on board with this

13:07.015 --> 13:09.163
but you've got to trust me.

13:10.948 --> 13:12.693
A fresh start is exactly what we need.

13:14.266 --> 13:17.103
Your mom would've been okay with that

13:17.103 --> 13:21.429
plus after everything that
just happened recently.

13:21.429 --> 13:24.012
(upbeat music)

14:19.006 --> 14:19.839
- Hey!

14:20.682 --> 14:21.515
Hey!

14:23.368 --> 14:26.125
Give that thing a rest, will ya?

14:26.125 --> 14:27.875
We've got work to do.

14:36.817 --> 14:37.734
Good to go.

14:43.065 --> 14:45.565
(tense music)

15:20.286 --> 15:22.119
Hey, the pizza's here.

15:24.609 --> 15:25.959
Why don't you take a break?

15:28.887 --> 15:31.387
(tense music)

15:37.017 --> 15:40.560
When your mom and I first started dating,

15:40.560 --> 15:42.163
she was such a spitfire.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.320
You're so much like her.

15:46.833 --> 15:49.356
You know what impressed me most about her

15:49.356 --> 15:51.623
was the fact that she never
took shit from anyone.

15:53.090 --> 15:56.920
She used to work at this ice cream parlor

15:56.920 --> 15:59.430
and she hated her boss.

15:59.430 --> 16:02.190
His name was Tom.

16:02.190 --> 16:04.173
She was the youngest employee there.

16:05.390 --> 16:09.233
And Tom would always try to humiliate her

16:09.233 --> 16:10.537
in front of the other girls,

16:10.537 --> 16:11.954
just a real jerk.

16:13.633 --> 16:15.157
I know right?

16:15.157 --> 16:18.053
One day, she decided she had enough.

16:18.970 --> 16:23.877
So she calls Tom up and
she goes, "Hey Tom."

16:25.260 --> 16:26.630
And he goes, "What?"

16:27.919 --> 16:30.417
And she goes, "There's only one difference

16:30.417 --> 16:33.681
"between you and a dead prostitute."

16:33.681 --> 16:35.670
(laughs)

16:35.670 --> 16:39.890
And he goes, "Oh yeah,
smart ass, what's that?"

16:39.890 --> 16:42.460
She goes, "You still suck."

16:42.460 --> 16:44.710
(laughing)

16:47.270 --> 16:48.880
And she just takes her apron off

16:48.880 --> 16:53.020
and just throws it on
the floor and walks out

16:53.020 --> 16:55.680
and all her coworkers
started applauding her

16:55.680 --> 16:56.700
and they were happy

16:56.700 --> 16:59.373
'cause no one really
stood up to Tom like that.

17:00.470 --> 17:02.250
Tom, he felt so bad

17:02.250 --> 17:04.619
that he actually called her the next day

17:04.619 --> 17:06.220
and he offered her the job back.

17:07.063 --> 17:09.869
Yeah, and I was like wow,

17:09.869 --> 17:11.440
it was just incredible.

17:13.145 --> 17:15.017
She would've been so proud of you.

17:21.489 --> 17:22.321
Hey,

17:25.351 --> 17:27.268
got a big day tomorrow.

17:31.788 --> 17:33.628
Demolished the pizza.

17:33.628 --> 17:36.211
(upbeat music)

17:39.895 --> 17:42.135
(bell ringing)

17:42.135 --> 17:44.718
(upbeat music)

17:54.991 --> 17:56.310
Well,

17:56.310 --> 17:58.268
you still brake like grandma.

17:58.268 --> 18:00.879
(upbeat music)

18:00.879 --> 18:02.712
You're getting better.

18:06.429 --> 18:08.596
(beeping)

18:43.702 --> 18:45.035
- What the fuck?

18:46.670 --> 18:47.770
What you got a dick in your ear?

18:47.770 --> 18:49.423
I said what the fuck.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.610
- Sorry about that.

18:51.610 --> 18:54.476
My friend here put a tampon
in backwards this morning

18:54.476 --> 18:55.836
with the applicator still attached.

18:55.836 --> 18:56.886
Where are you headed?

19:00.553 --> 19:01.873
Oof, Miss Baker?

19:03.633 --> 19:04.466
Shit, good luck.

19:05.428 --> 19:06.644
Go this way,

19:06.644 --> 19:07.477
this way down the hall,

19:07.477 --> 19:08.840
take a left, you'll meet the witch.

19:10.023 --> 19:15.023
(bell ringing)
(tense music)

19:15.397 --> 19:17.420
- We are the brave,

19:17.420 --> 19:19.409
we are the proud,

19:19.409 --> 19:22.973
the ones who stand out in any crowd.

19:24.090 --> 19:25.840
So let it be known

19:25.840 --> 19:28.260
through all the schools,

19:28.260 --> 19:30.673
Cranston High football rules.

19:32.209 --> 19:35.788
(class applauding)

19:35.788 --> 19:36.780
- Thank you, Britney.

19:36.780 --> 19:38.750
That doesn't exactly fall in

19:38.750 --> 19:41.670
to any of the assigned categories

19:41.670 --> 19:44.873
but we'll just chalk that
one up to free verse.

19:50.907 --> 19:51.824
Who's next?

19:54.197 --> 19:56.477
(knocking)

19:56.477 --> 20:01.477
You're late.
(ominous music)

20:07.406 --> 20:10.000
I suggest not making that a habit

20:10.000 --> 20:12.053
if you wish to pass this class.

20:21.200 --> 20:25.313
Excused from speaking,
well, that's a first.

20:27.450 --> 20:30.423
Very well, please take your seat.

20:40.583 --> 20:41.416
Who's next?

21:02.668 --> 21:03.967
(ominous music)

21:03.967 --> 21:07.540
- There is a world beyond comprehension,

21:07.540 --> 21:10.343
too diabolical for me to mention.

21:11.380 --> 21:13.240
It's not for the meek,

21:13.240 --> 21:14.950
but fake glimpse you seek,

21:14.950 --> 21:17.587
you need warning, pay attention.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.225
(class snapping)

21:21.225 --> 21:23.892
(ominous music)

21:25.748 --> 21:28.246
Whoa, whoa, love that.

21:28.246 --> 21:31.187
(bell ringing)

21:31.187 --> 21:33.854
(ominous music)

21:44.310 --> 21:45.483
- Hey shit for brains,

21:48.762 --> 21:50.520
you dropped something.

21:50.520 --> 21:51.900
- Shit for brains, huh?

21:51.900 --> 21:53.452
That's a choice name,

21:53.452 --> 21:54.767
you get it at home a lot?

21:54.767 --> 21:56.540
- You think you're funny?

21:56.540 --> 21:58.950
- I just wondered if you
hear it at home a lot.

21:58.950 --> 21:59.783
That's all it is.

21:59.783 --> 22:00.950
- Real funny, shit for brains.

22:00.950 --> 22:01.840
Let's see how funny you are

22:01.840 --> 22:03.825
after school in the parking lot.

22:03.825 --> 22:06.492
(ominous music)

22:08.502 --> 22:10.566
(bell ringing)

22:10.566 --> 22:12.983
(rock music)

22:24.280 --> 22:26.780
- Hey new girl, watch where
the fuck you're going.

22:29.843 --> 22:32.348
- Hey shit for brains,
ready for some laughs?

22:32.348 --> 22:35.765
(kids oohing and aahing)

22:38.081 --> 22:40.664
- Where you think you're going?

22:42.974 --> 22:45.641
(crowd gasping)

22:57.203 --> 22:59.090
- If someone say they
gotta go, they gotta go.

22:59.090 --> 22:59.923
You understand?

23:09.517 --> 23:10.850
Fake ass chains.

23:12.800 --> 23:16.977
- Just relax and concentrate
on the pendulum and my voice.

23:19.413 --> 23:21.230
When I count down to one,

23:21.230 --> 23:25.093
you will be in a highly suggestive state.

23:27.290 --> 23:28.123
10,

23:29.500 --> 23:30.333
nine,

23:32.240 --> 23:33.073
eight,

23:34.860 --> 23:35.693
seven,

23:37.850 --> 23:38.683
six,

23:40.449 --> 23:41.353
five,

23:44.790 --> 23:45.623
four,

23:47.450 --> 23:48.283
three,

23:50.060 --> 23:50.893
two,

23:52.678 --> 23:53.511
one.

23:59.072 --> 24:00.572
What is your name?

24:09.533 --> 24:10.773
Can you say it?

24:19.310 --> 24:20.143
Why not?

24:29.840 --> 24:31.040
Who won't let you?

24:31.970 --> 24:36.970
(scribbling furiously)
(ominous music)

24:38.640 --> 24:39.490
- She needs help.

24:40.827 --> 24:42.323
Stop her, do something!

24:44.870 --> 24:46.780
- Okay, when I count to 10,

24:46.780 --> 24:48.930
you will come out of your suggestive state

24:48.930 --> 24:51.343
and back to normal, fully aware.

24:52.753 --> 24:53.586
One,

24:53.586 --> 24:55.078
two,

24:55.078 --> 24:56.220
three.
- Alexis.

24:56.220 --> 24:57.660
- Four,

24:57.660 --> 24:58.493
five,

24:59.350 --> 25:00.780
six,

25:00.780 --> 25:02.080
seven,

25:02.080 --> 25:03.160
eight,

25:03.160 --> 25:04.893
nine, 10.

25:06.994 --> 25:07.827
- Alexis.

25:08.910 --> 25:10.653
- Are you fully aware?

25:10.653 --> 25:13.320
(ominous music)

25:16.753 --> 25:19.503
How many fingers am I holding up?

25:27.974 --> 25:28.807
Can I have the notepad?

25:29.718 --> 25:32.635
(dark piano music)

25:39.777 --> 25:43.526
Does this name mean anything to you?

25:43.526 --> 25:44.359
- No.

25:45.615 --> 25:48.532
(dark piano music)

26:05.201 --> 26:07.784
(upbeat music)

26:57.804 --> 27:00.471
(kids laughing)

27:09.729 --> 27:11.146
- So I was about,

27:12.529 --> 27:14.070
I was about 11 years old all right.

27:14.070 --> 27:16.420
So I'm waiting in line
to sit on Santa's lap.

27:16.420 --> 27:17.253
Mind you, I don't want to be there,

27:17.253 --> 27:19.203
my parents are making me go.

27:20.578 --> 27:22.110
I fuck with these fingers,

27:22.110 --> 27:24.080
just to throw that out there.

27:24.080 --> 27:26.500
So we finally get to
the front of the line.

27:26.500 --> 27:28.554
Then the elf picks me up,

27:28.554 --> 27:31.450
puts me on sweet Santa's lap,

27:31.450 --> 27:33.140
and then before Santa could say anything,

27:33.140 --> 27:37.070
I look over and I see a huge sack of toys

27:37.978 --> 27:40.603
and I'm just like, "Wow,
that's a huge sack."

27:42.892 --> 27:46.080
And then he goes, "My, yes it is."

27:46.080 --> 27:49.113
And then I go, "You want to know why

27:49.113 --> 27:50.290
"that's a huge sack?"

27:50.290 --> 27:52.547
And he goes, "Why?"

27:52.547 --> 27:55.823
"Because you only comes once a year."

27:55.823 --> 27:58.073
(laughing)

28:05.600 --> 28:07.550
- Isn't that the new chick from school?

28:09.094 --> 28:13.439
- Yeah, I heard she tried to off herself,

28:13.439 --> 28:15.380
that's why her dad moved her out here.

28:15.380 --> 28:18.743
- I heard her mom died
while giving birth to her.

28:20.130 --> 28:21.410
- No way, you're full of shit.

28:21.410 --> 28:23.730
- Why would I make that up?

28:23.730 --> 28:25.510
- Because Delora, you're a bitch.

28:25.510 --> 28:28.150
- No, you're a bitch.

28:28.150 --> 28:30.017
- No, you're a bitch.

28:31.366 --> 28:32.199
Ow!

28:33.848 --> 28:35.171
Damn!

28:35.171 --> 28:37.421
(laughing)

28:44.852 --> 28:46.769
Where's this guy going?

28:51.453 --> 28:52.873
- Look under your hand.

29:03.352 --> 29:05.350
- Yo Seth, don't you know it's not nice

29:05.350 --> 29:06.510
to chew and screw?

29:06.510 --> 29:08.520
- Sorry, I'm broke, I'll
get you back next time.

29:08.520 --> 29:09.670
- Say you better loser.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.860
- He was too busy writing his number down

29:13.860 --> 29:15.200
to pull out of his ball.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.527
- Okay, fuck you guys.

29:17.527 --> 29:18.983
- Get in the car, pretty boy.

29:20.089 --> 29:23.172
(intense rock music)

29:35.483 --> 29:38.180
Delora, you can't drive for shit.

29:38.180 --> 29:40.287
- Yeah, you know those mailboxes

29:40.287 --> 29:41.350
aren't worth points, right?

29:41.350 --> 29:43.440
- For real, his grandmother
drives better than you.

29:43.440 --> 29:44.373
- And she's dead.

29:45.609 --> 29:46.442
- Can you guys just shut up?

29:46.442 --> 29:47.610
You're giving me a headache.

29:47.610 --> 29:49.670
- Aw, sorry, snookums.

29:49.670 --> 29:54.090
- Yeah, sorry kissy face, love muffin.

29:54.090 --> 29:57.310
- [Ed] Snootchikins,
honey bunny, sugar booger.

29:57.310 --> 29:59.937
- [Judah] Hookey wookey, cuddle wuddle--

30:00.830 --> 30:01.663
- Wait.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.760
Those guys are idiots.

30:07.760 --> 30:08.870
- What they lack in brain power,

30:08.870 --> 30:10.890
they make up or in boyish charm.

30:10.890 --> 30:11.723
- Debatable.

30:13.400 --> 30:17.170
So you liked what you
saw in the diner today?

30:17.170 --> 30:18.530
- Maybe.

30:18.530 --> 30:21.330
- You know I could totally
make that happen for you.

30:21.330 --> 30:23.223
- I can handle it on my own, thanks.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.693
- Or I could give you something
you might like better.

30:31.828 --> 30:32.820
(laughing)

30:32.820 --> 30:34.003
- You have issues.

30:36.646 --> 30:39.563
(mysterious music)

30:45.520 --> 30:47.600
- 10 bucks she's not gonna call you.

30:47.600 --> 30:48.920
- Whoa dude, that's harsh.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.984
- Call it how I see it, man.

30:50.984 --> 30:51.817
You're not her type.

30:51.817 --> 30:52.650
- He's right.

30:52.650 --> 30:54.737
She's gonna be dating a
football player by week's end.

30:54.737 --> 30:55.570
- I don't know,

30:55.570 --> 30:57.330
you didn't see the way she
looked at me at the diner.

30:57.330 --> 30:58.390
I think I have a shot.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.910
- If one of us has to
spell yell, yeah, maybe.

31:00.910 --> 31:03.973
- Bullshit, none of us are
powerful enough for that yet.

31:06.543 --> 31:07.710
- What are you doing?

31:07.710 --> 31:09.476
- What do you think I'm doing?

31:09.476 --> 31:10.694
Lighting a fire.

31:10.694 --> 31:11.527
- Wait.

31:22.236 --> 31:24.079
- How the fuck did you do that?

31:24.079 --> 31:25.681
I mean I know how you did it but

31:25.681 --> 31:27.604
how'd you get so powerful?

31:27.604 --> 31:29.940
- I made another
sacrifice the other night.

31:29.940 --> 31:30.810
- What was it?

31:30.810 --> 31:32.760
- My neighbor's pomeranian.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.220
- That's a next level move.

31:34.220 --> 31:35.370
Why take the risk?

31:35.370 --> 31:38.201
You could get into some
serious shit for that.

31:38.201 --> 31:39.510
- Because the more we sacrifice,

31:39.510 --> 31:41.407
the more powerful he becomes.

31:41.407 --> 31:43.710
And the more powerful he becomes,

31:43.710 --> 31:46.580
the more powerful we become.

31:46.580 --> 31:49.150
Besides, I made sure no one
could trace it back to me.

31:49.150 --> 31:50.440
- How did you get away with it?

31:50.440 --> 31:52.810
- Fucking thing escaped constantly.

31:52.810 --> 31:54.110
It was only a matter of time

31:54.110 --> 31:57.359
before one of the neighbor's
other dogs attacked it.

31:57.359 --> 31:59.001
I mean I think I did it a favor.

31:59.001 --> 32:00.390
- Guys, this is big.

32:00.390 --> 32:02.920
None of us have ever been
this powerful before.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.677
Think of what we could do.

32:04.677 --> 32:08.160
- What we could do with a real sacrifice.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.063
I mean this, it's a parlor trick.

32:10.936 --> 32:12.838
If we sacrificed--

32:12.838 --> 32:14.255
- A goat, a goat.

32:15.715 --> 32:17.798
- The ultimate sacrifice.

32:18.760 --> 32:21.460
- No way, we're not ready for that yet.

32:21.460 --> 32:23.590
- Tomorrow night is the solstice,

32:23.590 --> 32:25.480
if we sacrifice her then--

32:25.480 --> 32:26.563
- Sacrifice who?

32:27.588 --> 32:30.190
- Look, we did some digging

32:30.190 --> 32:32.880
and we're pretty sure this
new chick is a virgin.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.262
- Alexis?

32:34.262 --> 32:37.663
No way, there's something
different about her.

32:37.663 --> 32:38.964
- So what?

32:38.964 --> 32:40.410
Time's ticking, man.

32:40.410 --> 32:42.380
- She's not like the
others, I'm telling you.

32:42.380 --> 32:44.010
Maybe she's not a virgin.

32:44.010 --> 32:45.860
- She is definitely a virgin.

32:45.860 --> 32:47.423
- How do you know?

32:47.423 --> 32:48.256
- I can tell.

32:48.256 --> 32:50.353
- I don't know, I just
don't think she's the one.

32:50.353 --> 32:51.850
- Come on, don't puss out on us

32:51.850 --> 32:53.957
just because you want to bang her.

32:53.957 --> 32:54.900
- I don't want to bang her.

32:54.900 --> 32:57.570
- Bullshit, we all saw the
way you were looking at her

32:57.570 --> 32:59.337
at the diner the other day.

32:59.337 --> 33:02.420
You want to have her fun with her, fine,

33:02.420 --> 33:04.610
just do it now

33:04.610 --> 33:07.380
because tomorrow night she is ours.

33:07.380 --> 33:08.943
- Delona's right,

33:08.943 --> 33:09.910
she's the one, we all know it.

33:09.910 --> 33:12.564
- No, we don't know.

33:12.564 --> 33:14.140
- Ow, fuck.

33:14.140 --> 33:16.790
- We made a pact

33:16.790 --> 33:20.553
and he's not backing
out of it, is he guys?

33:20.553 --> 33:22.883
- All right, then we'll
do it tomorrow night.

33:26.649 --> 33:27.482
Fuck.

33:29.628 --> 33:32.211
(gentle music)

35:00.661 --> 35:03.328
(alarm beeping)

35:10.147 --> 35:12.814
(ominous music)

35:21.326 --> 35:23.011
(gasps)

35:23.011 --> 35:25.678
(ominous music)

35:36.057 --> 35:38.890
(voices growling)

35:42.241 --> 35:44.908
(ominous music)

35:50.412 --> 35:53.420
(breathes heavily)

35:53.420 --> 35:56.087
(ominous music)

36:12.827 --> 36:15.744
(breathes heavily)

36:25.292 --> 36:28.292
(footsteps walking)

36:43.841 --> 36:46.508
(ominous music)

37:41.255 --> 37:44.323
- In every town and every city,

37:45.356 --> 37:47.106
there waits a wolf tempting pretty.

37:48.757 --> 37:50.920
Chisels away at the corner stone

37:52.620 --> 37:56.640
till flesh is gone and turns to bone.

38:01.454 --> 38:03.356
(alarm ringing)

38:03.356 --> 38:06.273
(breathes heavily)

38:14.530 --> 38:17.113
(gentle music)

38:23.745 --> 38:24.578
- Hey.

38:26.924 --> 38:28.341
Where you headed?

38:35.824 --> 38:36.657
- Seth.

38:38.385 --> 38:39.218
Huh.

38:41.643 --> 38:44.147
Will there be any adults there?

38:46.726 --> 38:47.976
Any other kids?

38:51.084 --> 38:52.751
Send me the address.

38:53.745 --> 38:56.460
Alexis, I'm happy you're
making friends so quickly.

38:59.080 --> 39:02.707
Remember what we talked
about, no drinking, okay?

39:09.339 --> 39:10.358
Love you, kiddo.

39:10.358 --> 39:13.275
(mysterious music)

39:17.555 --> 39:20.138
(upbeat music)

39:43.254 --> 39:48.254
(dramatic music)
(growling)

40:06.929 --> 40:09.512
(bell ringing)

40:11.250 --> 40:12.750
- Hey, glad you could make it.

40:14.640 --> 40:17.043
Oh, this, skateboarding accident.

40:18.899 --> 40:19.816
Come on in.

40:25.690 --> 40:27.050
Want a drink?

40:27.050 --> 40:28.577
I got it, I got it.

40:37.106 --> 40:38.508
Here you go.

40:38.508 --> 40:39.743
And open it,

40:39.743 --> 40:42.493
you never know who you can trust.

40:48.076 --> 40:50.326
(giggling)

40:53.948 --> 40:56.365
(dark music)

41:01.591 --> 41:02.424
- Are you blocking me?

41:02.424 --> 41:03.630
- Yup.

41:03.630 --> 41:05.140
- Since when can you do that?

41:05.140 --> 41:07.607
Since last week.

41:07.607 --> 41:09.120
- I tried it out on Mr.
Crowley during class,

41:09.120 --> 41:10.580
got all up in his head.

41:10.580 --> 41:12.231
Worked out pretty well,

41:12.231 --> 41:13.690
so I thought I'd give it a shot on you.

41:13.690 --> 41:16.030
- Oh you thought you'd
give it a shot on me.

41:16.030 --> 41:17.271
- Yeah.

41:17.271 --> 41:18.470
- Your fucking mind tricks out of my head,

41:18.470 --> 41:19.603
stay out of my head.

41:21.167 --> 41:23.550
- We gotta test out our powers somehow.

41:23.550 --> 41:25.650
- Yeah, don't test 'em out on me, asshole.

41:26.782 --> 41:29.449
(ominous music)

41:38.876 --> 41:39.895
- Hey.

41:39.895 --> 41:40.728
- Sorry to bother you,

41:40.728 --> 41:42.015
just thought you'd want to know,

41:42.015 --> 41:42.848
if you don't already,

41:42.848 --> 41:44.970
your car that left here earlier tonight,

41:44.970 --> 41:46.903
it has a headlight out.

41:46.903 --> 41:50.040
- Oh, I wasn't aware.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.042
Thank you for letting me know.

41:52.042 --> 41:52.875
- Of course,

41:52.875 --> 41:54.800
just looking out for my new neighbor.

41:54.800 --> 41:55.680
- [David] Thank you.

41:55.680 --> 41:56.513
- Yeah, name's Carl.

41:56.513 --> 41:57.770
I live in the beige house

41:57.770 --> 41:59.780
on the other side of those trees.

41:59.780 --> 42:00.613
- David.

42:00.613 --> 42:01.446
- Nice to meet you, David.

42:01.446 --> 42:02.938
- Nice to meet you.

42:02.938 --> 42:05.227
Actually, I was just having a night cap.

42:05.227 --> 42:07.680
Would you care to join me?

42:07.680 --> 42:11.010
- Sure, I've been known to make
a mistake or two in my life

42:11.010 --> 42:13.775
but turning down a night
cap is not one of 'em.

42:13.775 --> 42:15.767
- Good, good, please come in.

42:15.767 --> 42:17.167
- [David] Thank you.

42:17.167 --> 42:19.834
(ominous music)

43:08.164 --> 43:10.664
Everything all right in there?

43:15.710 --> 43:16.813
Much obliged.

43:19.428 --> 43:20.426
- To new beginnings.

43:20.426 --> 43:22.093
- To new beginnings.

43:25.550 --> 43:29.313
You know this town has seen better days.

43:31.120 --> 43:31.953
- Really?

43:33.012 --> 43:36.193
- Most people nowadays are
moving out rather than in.

43:37.800 --> 43:38.840
If you don't mind me asking,

43:38.840 --> 43:39.993
what brings you here?

43:42.410 --> 43:43.730
- Well, in short, I

43:45.680 --> 43:48.323
had too many memories where I was at.

43:50.564 --> 43:52.053
So I just had a change of scenery.

43:53.820 --> 43:55.350
Unfortunately, my wife passed away

43:55.350 --> 43:57.828
giving birth to our daughter, Alexis.

43:57.828 --> 43:58.661
- Oh my.

43:59.527 --> 44:01.253
I'm so sorry to hear that.

44:02.970 --> 44:06.827
- You know they say as time
goes on it gets easier.

44:08.218 --> 44:10.643
But in my case, it's just got harder.

44:21.427 --> 44:23.927
I had to look for a new place.

44:24.778 --> 44:25.861
I found this.

44:28.191 --> 44:31.260
It was too good to pass on.

44:31.260 --> 44:34.093
One thing led to another and here we are.

44:40.042 --> 44:41.875
- I'm sorry to say but

44:44.640 --> 44:48.373
my wife passed on under an
unusual circumstance as well.

44:50.650 --> 44:51.783
One day I came home,

44:54.159 --> 44:56.272
the front door was wide open.

44:56.272 --> 44:58.780
I found that quite peculiar.

44:58.780 --> 45:00.630
I called out to Margaret.

45:00.630 --> 45:01.683
She wasn't around.

45:03.110 --> 45:04.840
I searched the yard,

45:04.840 --> 45:06.203
called a few neighbors,

45:07.297 --> 45:08.823
no one had seen her.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.200
So I called the sheriff.

45:12.240 --> 45:13.590
He sent out a search party.

45:15.078 --> 45:19.577
Days, weeks, months went by.

45:23.820 --> 45:24.823
She never showed up.

45:27.300 --> 45:28.900
Sheriff didn't find any leads

45:30.060 --> 45:32.143
but I know what took her.

45:39.217 --> 45:40.467
- I'm so sorry.

45:42.169 --> 45:44.197
You say you know what took her?

45:48.980 --> 45:52.399
- See the thing you have to
understand about Pekansit

45:52.399 --> 45:53.233
is that it's cursed.

45:55.003 --> 45:56.933
There's a clearing out in the woods.

45:58.460 --> 46:02.453
Legend has it that when
Satan fell from heaven,

46:04.010 --> 46:06.940
he hit Earth right in the
middle of that clearing,

46:06.940 --> 46:08.440
fell straight through to hell.

46:10.470 --> 46:15.384
Since then, there's been a
balance of good and evil,

46:15.384 --> 46:16.683
for the most part,

46:17.617 --> 46:19.950
but every now and again,

46:19.950 --> 46:22.637
the scale tips in one
direction or the other.

46:24.920 --> 46:26.263
My wife,

46:27.810 --> 46:29.600
she dabbled in the occult.

46:32.032 --> 46:33.350
And I truly believe

46:33.350 --> 46:35.533
that that contributed
to her disappearance.

46:37.168 --> 46:40.390
Stay away from that,
you'll be good as gold.

46:47.118 --> 46:48.973
Is that your wife, that picture?

46:51.640 --> 46:53.190
- Yeah, that's my wife, Sariel.

46:54.760 --> 46:56.723
- My wife had that same necklace.

46:58.838 --> 47:01.840
Well anyway, I'm going
on like a damn fool.

47:01.840 --> 47:03.973
I'm sorry, old habits die hard.

47:05.192 --> 47:09.850
Look, there's just as
much good in this town

47:09.850 --> 47:10.683
as their is bad.

47:12.903 --> 47:15.660
- Thank you so much for coming by.

47:15.660 --> 47:18.486
Hey, and I really appreciate
you letting me know

47:18.486 --> 47:19.319
about the headlight.

47:19.319 --> 47:20.510
I'll definitely let my daughter know

47:20.510 --> 47:21.380
as soon as she gets home.

47:21.380 --> 47:22.850
- Yes, yes, no worries

47:22.850 --> 47:26.450
and now that you know all the
unpleasantries of this town,

47:26.450 --> 47:29.462
I promise the next conversation'll
be much more agreeable.

47:29.462 --> 47:30.700
- Okay, of course.

47:30.700 --> 47:32.059
- [Carl] Thanks for the drink.

47:32.059 --> 47:34.726
(ominous music)

47:48.900 --> 47:52.262
- Aren't you guys a little too old

47:52.262 --> 47:53.783
to be at a high school party?

47:54.740 --> 47:57.020
- We all graduated Cranston
High a couple years ago.

47:57.020 --> 48:00.240
- Yeah, we're only in
town for the weekend,

48:00.240 --> 48:03.900
casting roles for a movie
we're producing in LA.

48:03.900 --> 48:05.660
- I love movies.

48:05.660 --> 48:07.174
Can I be in it?

48:07.174 --> 48:08.007
- Of course.

48:08.007 --> 48:11.197
Perhaps we can go some place more private

48:11.197 --> 48:13.141
to talk about it.

48:13.141 --> 48:13.974
- Okay.

48:17.650 --> 48:18.690
- Hey, what's up?

48:18.690 --> 48:20.170
This is Delora.

48:20.170 --> 48:21.033
- We've met.

48:22.930 --> 48:24.973
- And that is Judah.

48:36.230 --> 48:37.330
- How you doing today?

48:38.490 --> 48:39.323
My name's Judah.

48:41.271 --> 48:44.433
Say, you just arrived for my
favorite part of the night.

48:48.320 --> 48:49.920
It's time to get wild everybody.

48:55.677 --> 48:56.759

50:01.809 --> 50:03.209
- Maybe we should make sure.

50:04.290 --> 50:06.710
- I think Seth's got it under control.

50:16.360 --> 50:18.800
- I'm really glad you came tonight.

50:18.800 --> 50:19.860
This may be a small town

50:19.860 --> 50:22.720
but it still has its share of bad people.

50:22.720 --> 50:23.960
You need someone like me

50:23.960 --> 50:25.640
who can take me under their wing

50:25.640 --> 50:27.690
and keep you away from the bad people

50:27.690 --> 50:29.140
and get you in with the good.

50:30.471 --> 50:31.430
A few of us are gonna go to a campfire

50:31.430 --> 50:33.570
a little ways back in the woods.

50:33.570 --> 50:34.403
Want to come?

50:37.927 --> 50:39.813
I promise, I won't bite.

50:48.487 --> 50:50.787
Come on, ladies and
gents, the night is young.

50:55.009 --> 50:57.676
(ominous music)

51:12.092 --> 51:14.332
(grunting)

51:14.332 --> 51:16.999
(ominous music)

51:24.368 --> 51:26.652
- [Alexis] Hi, you have
reached Alexis Ayers.

51:26.652 --> 51:29.969
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

51:29.969 --> 51:32.636
(ominous music)

51:38.249 --> 51:41.082
(voices mumbling)

51:49.488 --> 51:53.366
- Dude, cut that out, I can't see shit.

51:53.366 --> 51:54.199
- Can you see shit now?

51:54.199 --> 51:55.032
'Cause I can.

51:56.011 --> 51:58.261
(laughing)

51:59.185 --> 52:01.120
- Shh, shh, guys what was that?

52:01.120 --> 52:02.650
- Probably nothing.

52:02.650 --> 52:04.463
Let's keep moving, we're almost there.

52:07.562 --> 52:10.062
- Nectar of the gods, bitches!

52:13.580 --> 52:16.497
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

52:18.880 --> 52:22.083
Let's make a night to remember.

52:24.683 --> 52:26.210
Anybody got any ideas?

52:26.210 --> 52:27.250
- I've got an idea.

52:27.250 --> 52:29.103
- Okay, shoot your shot.

52:30.123 --> 52:32.206
- We could have a seance.

52:33.820 --> 52:35.366
- Whoa, hold up guys,

52:35.366 --> 52:36.199
a certain member of our party

52:36.199 --> 52:38.163
doesn't want to partake in a seance.

52:38.163 --> 52:40.246
(booing)

52:42.580 --> 52:44.180
- It's completely harmless.

52:44.180 --> 52:46.610
All those stories you hear are bullshit.

52:46.610 --> 52:49.547
It's just like a good
way to pass the time,

52:49.547 --> 52:51.383
like telling ghost stories.

52:52.430 --> 52:53.670
- Come on guys, we're not gonna do it

52:53.670 --> 52:55.320
unless she's comfortable with it.

52:56.707 --> 53:01.707
- Do it, do it, do it, do
it, do it, do it, do it,

53:01.782 --> 53:03.449
do it, do it, do it.

53:05.440 --> 53:07.597
- Yeah, yes.
- Let's go.

53:09.243 --> 53:10.910
- Let's get started.

53:22.902 --> 53:25.569
(ominous music)

53:41.766 --> 53:42.700
- Elders from beyond the grave,

53:42.700 --> 53:44.440
move among us.

53:44.440 --> 53:46.660
We bring you gifts in your time of need

53:46.660 --> 53:48.223
and seek counsel in ours.

53:49.130 --> 53:50.810
Be guided by our voice,

53:50.810 --> 53:51.713
visit among us.

53:52.816 --> 53:54.953
Show us a sign of your presence.

53:57.969 --> 54:00.636
(ominous music)

54:02.670 --> 54:04.250
- Great job, dip shit.

54:04.250 --> 54:06.937
- Chill guy, I know what we need.

54:08.456 --> 54:11.123
(ominous music)

54:57.158 --> 54:57.991
Delora.

55:01.150 --> 55:03.540
- Wait, it won't work now.

55:03.540 --> 55:05.220
- What are you talking about?

55:05.220 --> 55:07.030
- We already started with her.

55:07.030 --> 55:07.960
In order for it to work,

55:07.960 --> 55:10.110
we would've had to
finish without stopping.

55:11.990 --> 55:13.392
- That's bullshit.

55:13.392 --> 55:14.340
- I'm serious.

55:14.340 --> 55:15.190
To make it proper,

55:15.190 --> 55:17.283
we have to start with someone else.

55:18.262 --> 55:21.291
(ominous music)

55:21.291 --> 55:22.124
- Come on, it's harmless.

55:22.124 --> 55:23.707
It'll shut these guys up

55:23.707 --> 55:24.693
so we can get back to the party.

55:25.547 --> 55:28.214
(ominous music)

56:05.115 --> 56:07.930
- Dwellers of the
netherworld, move among us.

56:07.930 --> 56:11.870
Isbel, give us the strength to
transcend the spiritual realm

56:11.870 --> 56:14.090
and meet you on the road to Gehena

56:14.090 --> 56:18.205
as we offer the worthiest
of sacrifices at your feet,

56:18.205 --> 56:19.970
a virgin.

56:19.970 --> 56:21.773
Feed on the sacrifice,

56:21.773 --> 56:23.462
let it augment your strength.

56:23.462 --> 56:25.398
Oh ruler of all that is unholy.

56:25.398 --> 56:30.398
(speaking in foreign language)
(ominous music)

56:43.513 --> 56:46.263
(laser blasting)

56:53.099 --> 56:54.112
- Get her.

56:54.112 --> 56:56.779
(ominous music)

57:16.571 --> 57:17.404
Oh Alexis.

57:20.192 --> 57:23.310
(ominous music)

57:23.310 --> 57:24.143
- Alexis.

57:25.097 --> 57:27.764
(ominous music)

57:28.667 --> 57:30.673
- Come out, come out, wherever you are.

57:30.673 --> 57:33.340
(ominous music)

57:46.648 --> 57:49.231
- Alexis, we're gonna find you.

57:50.107 --> 57:52.774
(ominous music)

58:00.974 --> 58:02.474
- Tide draws near,

58:04.665 --> 58:06.915
all truth shall be revealed

58:08.974 --> 58:12.724
and the righteous will
stand in their fields.

58:18.952 --> 58:21.202
But first, comes suffering.

58:23.416 --> 58:25.666
And great though it may be,

58:27.317 --> 58:31.067
the souls of the chosen
set all sinners free.

58:36.414 --> 58:39.164
(dramatic music)

58:41.042 --> 58:43.709
(ominous music)

58:50.470 --> 58:55.230
- You know, it's a shame
it had to end this way.

58:55.230 --> 58:56.600
You see all of this could've been avoided

58:56.600 --> 58:58.773
if he had stayed out of it.

59:01.120 --> 59:03.720
Remember when you asked
your ouija board for answers

59:05.108 --> 59:06.443
about your boyfriend and your dead mom?

59:08.350 --> 59:10.200
You were actually talking to a demon,

59:11.410 --> 59:14.010
the very demon we're gonna
sacrifice you to tonight.

59:16.160 --> 59:17.173
How do I know that?

59:18.180 --> 59:19.713
See, we're connected to him.

59:21.140 --> 59:22.520
The more powerful he is,

59:22.520 --> 59:23.973
the more powerful we become.

59:25.496 --> 59:27.780
And in order to become more powerful,

59:27.780 --> 59:28.823
he needs souls.

59:29.910 --> 59:31.570
He tried to take yours that night

59:32.720 --> 59:34.837
but the big man upstairs didn't let him.

59:36.060 --> 59:36.893
He interfered

59:37.800 --> 59:39.883
and he's not going to interfere this time.

59:45.310 --> 59:46.540
- You're looking sweaty.

59:46.540 --> 59:49.483
Allow me to powder your face.

59:50.355 --> 59:52.605
(coughing)

01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:09.073
- Dang bro, you got yourself a good one.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.770
How many fingers am I holding up?

01:00:19.542 --> 01:00:22.355
- Oh that was some good stuff.

01:00:22.355 --> 01:00:24.472
Oh that kicked in quick.

01:00:24.472 --> 01:00:26.722
(laughing)

01:00:27.736 --> 01:00:28.569
You're fucked up.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.830
(laughs)

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:34.420
- Look at you.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:37.230
Look what you got yourself into.

01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:38.983
Fool, what a fool.

01:00:41.038 --> 01:00:43.455
(dark music)

01:01:01.469 --> 01:01:03.052
- Death approaches.

01:01:04.393 --> 01:01:05.683
Spirits call.

01:01:08.175 --> 01:01:10.342
The warrior must take fall

01:01:12.801 --> 01:01:15.884
before the true destiny comes to wait

01:01:18.401 --> 01:01:21.568
and she begins a new and eternal fate.

01:01:25.953 --> 01:01:28.703
(dramatic music)

01:01:29.863 --> 01:01:32.196
(sad music)

01:01:52.672 --> 01:01:53.505
- Mom.

01:01:53.505 --> 01:01:55.088
- My child,

01:01:55.088 --> 01:01:57.703
I've waited so long for this day.

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.797
You have completed the first step.

01:02:01.797 --> 01:02:03.937
You've told me your sins.

01:02:03.937 --> 01:02:06.855
Now, I will grant you the power

01:02:06.855 --> 01:02:10.439
to carry out the next
light of your journey.

01:02:10.439 --> 01:02:13.780
Forgive me for what I must do, my child,

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:16.660
but it is the only way to
complete your atonement

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:18.273
and fulfill the prophecy.

01:02:21.175 --> 01:02:23.925
(dramatic music)

01:02:26.321 --> 01:02:28.904
(gentle music)

01:02:35.479 --> 01:02:37.777
(inhales sharply)

01:02:37.777 --> 01:02:40.360
(gentle music)

01:02:59.673 --> 01:03:03.079
What has been taken has
been given back tenfold.

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:04.820
In your voice, you can find the power

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:08.880
to dispel darkness leaving only light.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:13.210
Now go forth and save
mankind from darkness.

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:14.703
I will always be with you.

01:03:16.247 --> 01:03:17.997
I love you, my child.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.847
(ominous music)

01:03:29.916 --> 01:03:31.320
- What are you waiting for?

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.153
Get her.

01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:46.213
Typical male, no balls.

01:03:48.526 --> 01:03:50.776
(grunting)

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.943
- Stay away from my daughter.

01:04:15.575 --> 01:04:18.492
(gunfire blasting)

01:04:28.369 --> 01:04:30.619
(grunting)

01:04:50.348 --> 01:04:55.098
(screaming)
(screeching)

01:05:05.597 --> 01:05:08.014
(dark music)

01:05:51.073 --> 01:05:54.854
- You have all made a grave mistake

01:05:54.854 --> 01:05:56.153
in the path you have chosen.

01:05:57.127 --> 01:06:00.027
You have ignored the signs
pointing you towards salvation.

01:06:03.357 --> 01:06:05.170
I made a similar mistake.

01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:10.370
However, he had made other plans for me

01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:14.193
which is why I stand here before you.

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:16.533
As he has done with me,

01:06:17.546 --> 01:06:20.594
he has chosen to use your strength

01:06:20.594 --> 01:06:23.870
to help dispel darkness from mankind.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:30.703
The process of transcending
human existence is not pleasant.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.343
Forgive me for what I must do.

01:06:39.357 --> 01:06:42.107
(dramatic music)

01:06:57.431 --> 01:07:02.181
- In the mouth of madness lies
the key to heaven's gates.

01:07:05.207 --> 01:07:09.374
A myriad of fulfillment
for those who lie in wait.

01:07:10.706 --> 01:07:14.623
Those who grow impatient
must pay a deeper debt

01:07:18.077 --> 01:07:21.927
and burn in desperation of
what hasn't happened yet.

01:07:27.608 --> 01:07:31.570
- You have all been
chosen for your strength.

01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:34.730
Alexis, yours was known to me upon birth.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.590
The rest of you discovered yours over time

01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:42.850
only believing the
result of your sacrifices

01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:44.050
to the purveyor of lies.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:51.440
In reality, they were inherent
in all of you upon birth.

01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:55.330
Now that the darkness has been removed,

01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:58.750
over time, light will
fill the empty spaces

01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:01.846
making you the true warriors of light

01:08:01.846 --> 01:08:03.846
you were destined to be.

01:08:05.126 --> 01:08:08.468
You're the last hope for
the survival of mankind.

01:08:08.468 --> 01:08:11.240
Their gifts provide you what is necessary

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.513
to fulfill the prophecy.

01:08:15.198 --> 01:08:17.781
(gentle music)

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.819
- Like me, you've not only been given

01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:33.420
the opportunity to atone for your sins

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.832
but have been identified as warriors.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:41.700
Like me, you have been given
the power to dispel darkness

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:44.133
leaving only light.

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:47.600
Together, we will fight to save mankind

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:51.006
from those who were like we once were.

01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:54.487
It will not be easy for you.

01:08:56.031 --> 01:08:59.774
I have reached the height of my suffering.

01:08:59.774 --> 01:09:00.858
You have not.

01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:06.014
Find strength in each other and in me

01:09:06.014 --> 01:09:09.514
and together, we will fulfill our mission.

01:09:11.613 --> 01:09:14.363
(dramatic music)

01:09:30.974 --> 01:09:33.307
(screaming)

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:37.453
(rock music)

01:10:41.610 --> 01:10:42.777
- [Male] Fuck!

01:10:45.413 --> 01:10:46.840
- Got you bitches.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.700
- [Male] Such an asshole.

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:49.910
- What the hell are you waiting for?

01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:51.310
It's showtime, get in there.

01:10:56.211 --> 01:10:57.530
- [Male] How'd you get her to come here?

01:10:57.530 --> 01:11:00.547
- [Male] I made her an
offer she couldn't refuse.

01:11:07.049 --> 01:11:07.882
- Guys.

01:11:10.051 --> 01:11:11.560
Did I get that role or?

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.840
- Not just yet.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.363
There's still one more
thing we need you to do.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.440
- No, there's not.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.273
- [Male] Fuck.

01:11:22.231 --> 01:11:25.690
Woohoo, look at here boys,

01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:28.510
a couple more stars looking
to make it into show business.

01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:30.733
Let's see if they have what it takes.

01:11:32.094 --> 01:11:35.190
(dramatic music)

01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:37.440
(grunting)

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.283
- Hi, I'm ready for my close up.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.694
- Hey, wait a second now.
- Let's dance, cowboys.

01:11:46.694 --> 01:11:47.527
- Stop!

01:11:49.315 --> 01:11:51.648
(screaming)

01:11:54.537 --> 01:11:57.287
(ominous music)
