Buongiorno, miei amici.

00:10.459 --> 00:12.230
(IN ITALIAN ACCENT)

00:12.231 --> 00:14.000
The captain said we will be

00:10.459 --> 00:14.000
docking at the Italian island

00:14.042 --> 00:16.042
of Capaldi in two hours!

00:16.082 --> 00:17.522
He also said I need

00:17.523 --> 00:18.959
to work on my Italian accent.

00:20.167 --> 00:22.105
Oh, I cannot wait to explore

00:22.106 --> 00:24.042
the ancient Roman ruins there!

00:24.083 --> 00:25.292
A beautiful island

00:25.293 --> 00:26.500
and a history lesson.

00:26.542 --> 00:28.959
Is this a vacation or heaven?

00:30.042 --> 00:31.209
Nice necklace, Jessie.

00:31.250 --> 00:33.167
- Yeah, where
- did you get it?

00:33.209 --> 00:34.355
And does it have anything

00:34.356 --> 00:35.500
to do with why we had

00:33.209 --> 00:35.500
to leave Spain so quickly?

00:35.542 --> 00:37.751
No, that was because

00:37.752 --> 00:39.959
Luke caused an

00:35.542 --> 00:39.959
international incident.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.125
Okay. If you can't block

00:41.126 --> 00:42.250

00:42.292 --> 00:43.876
you have no business

00:43.877 --> 00:45.459
calling yourself the

00:42.292 --> 00:45.459
Minister of Defense.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.292
Anyway,

00:48.334 --> 00:50.000
- my dad actually got
- this necklace

00:50.042 --> 00:51.042
While he was stationed

00:51.043 --> 00:52.043
in Italy years ago.

00:52.083 --> 00:53.772

00:53.773 --> 00:55.459
but that could just mean

00:52.083 --> 00:55.459
it was on sale.

Hey, why did you two

00:57.460 --> 00:59.417
pile your dirty clothes

00:55.500 --> 00:59.417
in my room?

00:59.459 --> 01:02.042
Uh, so you can wash them.

01:02.083 --> 01:03.583
Why else do you think

right here in Capaldi.

- reached for my necklace.

a very beautiful woman.

04:24.356 --> 04:25.626
yourself, Jessie.

04:30.667 --> 04:32.626
- who are almost as
- beautiful as me.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.584
Actually, no.

- Most of the women - here are not known
- For their beauty.

the beautiful woman

04:53.481 --> 04:54.834
loved the Emperor's son,

04:54.876 --> 04:56.792
- but the Emperor
- did not approve.

04:56.834 --> 04:58.356

- Harrius Backus.

struck me from

06:48.125 --> 06:52.250
across the battlefield,

06:52.292 --> 06:53.685
- and I just had to
- bring it back to you.

the same thing.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.022
Right before

07:00.023 --> 07:01.042
I chopped his legs off.

07:01.083 --> 07:02.584

07:02.626 --> 07:04.906
- And now I'm wondering - if
this flower was - Always red.

- of tendon?

Hottia, while I was

07:11.334 --> 07:12.751
all I could think about was

07:12.752 --> 07:14.167
my deep love for you.

07:14.209 --> 07:15.709
And not getting killed.

07:15.751 --> 07:17.209
- But mostly my

07:22.314 --> 07:23.792

waists in waste?

07:28.250 --> 07:30.584
He is a descendant of royalty,

07:30.626 --> 07:31.980
while you are

07:31.981 --> 07:33.334
a filth-encrusted peasant.

07:33.375 --> 07:34.626
You do the math.

07:34.667 --> 07:35.751
Actually do not,

07:35.752 --> 07:36.834
it always ends badly.

07:37.876 --> 07:38.876
True.

07:40.667 --> 07:42.375
Hey.

07:42.417 --> 07:44.250
Let's become gladiators.

07:44.292 --> 07:45.292
No one's braver

07:45.293 --> 07:46.293
than those guys.

07:46.334 --> 07:47.751
The ladies will love us!

07:47.792 --> 07:49.334
Brilliant, Odorus!

07:49.375 --> 07:50.501
But do you think

07:50.502 --> 07:51.626
there are any openings?

07:53.250 --> 07:55.000
- (CRASHING)
- (MAN SCREAMING)

07:55.626 --> 07:57.334
(PEOPLE GASPING)

07:59.334 --> 08:00.459
I'm guessing yes.

08:05.918 --> 08:07.042
Ditzia!

08:07.083 --> 08:08.500
Sarcastica!

08:09.584 --> 08:10.814
Are you sleeping

08:10.815 --> 08:12.042
on the job?

08:12.083 --> 08:13.209
What kind of lazy,

08:13.210 --> 08:14.334
good for nothing

08:14.375 --> 08:16.001
servant naps when there's

08:16.002 --> 08:17.626
work to be done?

08:20.542 --> 08:22.376
Sorry, Emperor,

08:22.377 --> 08:24.209
but we didn't get much

08:20.542 --> 08:24.209
sleep last night.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.543
Our mattress is made

08:25.544 --> 08:26.834
from the bones

08:24.250 --> 08:26.834
of your last servants.

08:27.751 --> 08:29.042
Silence!

08:29.083 --> 08:30.730
It is now time for the

08:30.731 --> 08:32.375
imperial grape-feeding.

08:32.417 --> 08:33.417
Ah!

08:36.082 --> 08:37.292
You do it.

08:37.333 --> 08:38.958
No, you do it.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.417
Do you know how hard it is

08:40.458 --> 08:41.897
to get a job as

08:41.898 --> 08:43.333
a nine-fingered servant

08:40.458 --> 08:43.333
in this economy?

08:45.792 --> 08:47.334
(CHOMPING)

08:47.375 --> 08:49.292
- Blech! (SPITS)
- (SHRIEKS)

08:51.459 --> 08:53.792
These grapes are not peeled!

08:53.834 --> 08:55.626
What am I, livestock?

08:56.626 --> 08:58.542
You two can make it up to me

08:58.584 --> 09:00.626
with a back waxing!

09:01.459 --> 09:02.709
(RETCHING)

09:02.751 --> 09:04.043
I think I'm gonna need to

09:04.044 --> 09:05.334
hit the vomitorium.

09:08.334 --> 09:09.959
Emperor Baldius...

09:10.000 --> 09:11.626
I mean, Berteus...

09:11.667 --> 09:13.584
You have visitors.

09:13.626 --> 09:15.251
Father, I know you do not

09:15.252 --> 09:16.876
approve of our union,

09:16.918 --> 09:18.709
but I love Hottia Messica

09:18.751 --> 09:20.042
and I intend to marry her.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.792
What?

09:23.667 --> 09:25.588
- Yeah, maybe I'll just go
- wait in the chariot.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.042
So go ahead,

09:29.083 --> 09:30.459
throw us to the lions,

09:30.500 --> 09:31.959
burn us at the stake,

09:32.000 --> 09:33.250
hurl us from the

09:33.251 --> 09:34.500
highest mountains...

09:32.000 --> 09:34.500
Sweetie.

09:34.542 --> 09:35.626
Stop giving him ideas.

09:37.626 --> 09:39.042
Very well.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.063
If you two are truly in love,

09:41.064 --> 09:43.042
then I support you.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.500
Say whatticus, now?

09:46.417 --> 09:48.334
- In fact, I have
- a gift for you.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.417
The Enchanted Necklace.

09:52.459 --> 09:53.334
(GASPS)

09:53.375 --> 09:55.542
Hey!

09:55.584 --> 09:56.626
You said that would be my

09:56.627 --> 09:57.667
reward for a life of

09:55.584 --> 09:57.667
brain-numbing servitude.

09:57.709 --> 09:59.231
Well, don't believe

09:59.232 --> 10:00.751
anything I say when

09:57.709 --> 10:00.751
I'm hungry for grapes.

10:02.459 --> 10:03.771
Welcome to the family,

10:03.772 --> 10:05.083
my dear.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.375
Aw, thanks, Dad.

10:07.417 --> 10:09.042
- Ugh...
- Okay. Okay.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.584
It's baby steps, gotcha.

10:12.083 --> 10:14.459
Meet me at the arena tonight!

10:14.500 --> 10:15.834
We shall celebrate

10:15.876 --> 10:17.147
by watching a tiger

10:17.148 --> 10:18.417
eat a thief's foot!

10:20.083 --> 10:21.563
I feel like Emperor Berteus

10:21.564 --> 10:23.042
is just misunderstood.

10:23.083 --> 10:25.542
He sounds like a great guy!

10:25.584 --> 10:27.542
- No, he was
- obviously a mean,

10:27.584 --> 10:29.063
Demanding, bossy-pants

10:29.064 --> 10:30.542
who mistreats his servants.

10:31.626 --> 10:33.042
I'm tired of standing.

10:33.083 --> 10:35.000
- Knee seat!
- (SIGHS)

10:38.876 --> 10:40.542
Signorina Jessie,

10:40.584 --> 10:42.375
- there is something
- I want to ask you.

10:42.417 --> 10:43.439
Uh-oh.

10:43.440 --> 10:44.459
Here it comes.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.000
He wants to borrow money.

10:47.667 --> 10:48.855
Or ask you to

10:48.856 --> 10:50.042
carry his suitcase,

10:50.083 --> 10:51.251
"just until you

10:51.252 --> 10:52.417
get through customs."

10:53.125 --> 10:55.042
No, no, no.

10:55.083 --> 10:56.292
I wish to ask Jessie

10:56.293 --> 10:57.500
to be my date to the

10:55.083 --> 10:57.500
Festival of Fire.

10:57.542 --> 10:59.751
Oh, Marco, I would love to.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.689
I'll wear my best

11:01.690 --> 11:03.584
flame-retardant dress and

10:59.792 --> 11:03.584
go easy on the hair spray!

11:03.626 --> 11:04.855
You make me the happiest man

11:04.856 --> 11:06.083
in all of Capaldi!

11:06.125 --> 11:07.584
Except for Giuseppe.

11:07.626 --> 11:08.813
He invented

11:08.814 --> 11:10.000
the stuffed crust pizza.

11:10.042 --> 11:12.042
He live like a King!

11:12.083 --> 11:13.042
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)

11:13.083 --> 11:15.542
Oh, mi scusi, per momento.

11:18.584 --> 11:20.584
Well, Jessie,

11:20.626 --> 11:22.602
- it looks like you finally got - the
romantic adventure - You were looking for.

11:22.626 --> 11:23.792
You can say that again.

11:23.834 --> 11:24.959
Slump over!

11:25.542 --> 11:26.876
(GASPS)

11:26.918 --> 11:29.417
Jessie, you ruined the ruins!

11:30.667 --> 11:31.792
That was already broken.

Man, Marco was right.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.167
Girls love firewalking.

11:52.209 --> 11:53.459
Come on.

11:54.083 --> 11:56.626
Uh, hi.

11:56.667 --> 11:57.855
Me and my bro are going

11:57.856 --> 11:59.042
to be firewalking later, too.

11:59.083 --> 12:00.042
- (CHUCKLES)
- Huh?

12:00.083 --> 12:01.542
But, you know,

12:01.584 --> 12:02.709
even slower

12:02.751 --> 12:04.667
and, uh, brave-ier.

12:09.856 --> 12:11.042
Yeah?

12:11.083 --> 12:12.938
I'm afraid your mouth has

12:12.939 --> 12:14.792
written a check our feet

12:11.083 --> 12:14.792
cannot cash.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.334
I also think I just broke

12:16.335 --> 12:17.834
one of my knuckles.

12:17.876 --> 12:19.460
Okay, who wants to hear

12:19.461 --> 12:21.042
the rest of the story

12:17.876 --> 12:21.042
of the necklace? Huh?

12:21.083 --> 12:22.500
What else is there to hear?

12:22.542 --> 12:23.876
Emperor Berteus is awesome.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.209
End of story.

12:25.250 --> 12:26.897
Oh, no, stories on Capaldi

12:26.898 --> 12:28.542
are notoriously long.

12:28.584 --> 12:30.042
- Minimum two
- bathroom breaks.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.355
Don't you worry. I have the

12:31.356 --> 12:32.626
bladder of an elephant.

12:33.167 --> 12:34.584
- Okay, not what men
- want to hear.

12:34.626 --> 12:35.751
On with the story!

12:37.626 --> 12:38.667
Oh.

12:38.709 --> 12:40.459
Hunkio.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.772
As an early wedding present,

12:41.773 --> 12:43.042
I got you this

12:40.500 --> 12:43.042
designer sundial watch.

12:43.083 --> 12:44.792
It keeps perfect time.

12:44.834 --> 12:46.059
- As long as you
- use it outside.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.834
- During the day.
- And there's no clouds.

12:49.709 --> 12:51.626
Hottia, I'm sorry, but...

12:52.209 --> 12:53.709
The wedding is off!

12:53.751 --> 12:54.938
Okay, not an

12:54.939 --> 12:56.125
accessories guy. Noted.

12:56.918 --> 12:58.709
No, it is...

12:58.751 --> 13:00.334
I cannot explain it.

13:00.375 --> 13:01.709
Somehow...

13:01.751 --> 13:02.897
I am just not in love

13:02.898 --> 13:04.042
with you anymore.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.147
What? Is this about

13:05.148 --> 13:06.209
your father?

13:06.250 --> 13:07.417
No...

13:07.459 --> 13:09.063
I do not know what it is.

13:09.064 --> 13:10.667
It is just over.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.167
Wait!

13:13.209 --> 13:14.438
Hunkio, can't we talk

13:14.439 --> 13:15.667
about this?

13:15.709 --> 13:17.667
- Oh, but you're just gonna
- keep the watch?

13:17.709 --> 13:19.000
Okay. All right...

13:22.876 --> 13:23.960
My lady,

13:23.961 --> 13:25.042
are you all right?

13:25.083 --> 13:26.751
No.

13:26.792 --> 13:28.230
The love of my life

13:28.231 --> 13:29.667
just handed me my

13:26.792 --> 13:29.667
walking parchments.

13:29.709 --> 13:30.772
And I have

13:30.773 --> 13:31.834
no clue in Hades why!

13:31.876 --> 13:33.230
I am so sorry that

13:33.231 --> 13:34.584
happened to you.

13:34.626 --> 13:36.292
- The names
- Odorus Armpiticus.

13:36.334 --> 13:37.959
Here's my Roman numeral.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Call me.

13:39.876 --> 13:41.709
Excuse him.

13:41.751 --> 13:42.959
He's feeling rather confident

13:43.000 --> 13:44.522
as we have just

13:44.523 --> 13:46.042
signed up to be gladiators!

13:46.083 --> 13:47.959
- I hear they have a great
- retirement plan.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.439
Of course,

13:49.440 --> 13:50.876
no one's ever lived

13:48.000 --> 13:50.876
to use it, but still.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.459
Okay, I'm done

13:55.460 --> 13:56.834
cutting your hair.

13:56.876 --> 13:57.876
All four of them.

13:58.876 --> 14:01.959
Hey, you got it easy!

14:02.000 --> 14:03.396
It's like trying to cut

14:03.397 --> 14:04.792
through marble down here!

14:04.834 --> 14:06.667
Gross, nasty marble.

14:08.751 --> 14:10.059
- You know what would
- make that harder?

14:10.083 --> 14:12.042
If I cut off your hand.

14:12.083 --> 14:13.459
Which, I won't do,

14:13.460 --> 14:14.834
as I'm in such a good mood.

14:14.876 --> 14:16.460
Because you're happy

14:16.461 --> 14:18.042
that your son has found

14:14.876 --> 14:18.042
true love with Hottia?

14:18.083 --> 14:20.042
What? No!

14:20.083 --> 14:22.209
Their relationship is doomed!

14:22.250 --> 14:24.501
The enchanted necklace

14:24.502 --> 14:26.751
I gave Hottia

14:22.250 --> 14:26.751
has a spell on it!

14:26.792 --> 14:29.042
(GASPS) A spell?

14:29.083 --> 14:31.167
I had a witch curse it.

14:31.209 --> 14:32.584
Whoever is in possession

14:32.585 --> 14:33.959
of that necklace,

14:34.000 --> 14:35.522
will forever be

14:35.523 --> 14:37.042
unlucky in love.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.083
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

14:41.083 --> 14:42.626
Now, if you'll

14:42.627 --> 14:44.167
excuse me, it is time

14:41.083 --> 14:44.167
for my milk bath.

14:44.209 --> 14:45.605
Servants,

14:45.606 --> 14:47.000
squeeze me a goat!

14:49.292 --> 14:50.709
This is terrible!

14:50.751 --> 14:51.814
We have to go

14:51.815 --> 14:52.876
warn Hottia.

14:52.918 --> 14:55.042
And that goat!

14:55.083 --> 14:56.924
- JESSIE: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
- stop right there!

14:57.292 --> 14:58.417
So...

14:58.459 --> 15:00.059
- The necklace that
- I'm wearing right now,

15:00.083 --> 15:01.605
The one I thought

15:01.606 --> 15:03.125
was lucky, is actually cursed?

15:03.167 --> 15:05.042
- It's not that simple,
- you see.

15:05.083 --> 15:06.897
Oh, mi scusi,

15:06.898 --> 15:08.709
one more time,

15:05.083 --> 15:08.709
per favore.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.375
Wait, so...

15:11.417 --> 15:12.730
My love life is the

15:12.731 --> 15:14.042
victim of an ancient curse?

15:14.083 --> 15:17.375
That explains so, so much.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.334
Yeah!

15:20.375 --> 15:22.064
That necklace is the

15:22.065 --> 15:23.751
reason that Jessie and

15:20.375 --> 15:23.751
I are not a couple.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.834
- Hmm, it's not even on
- the first page of reasons.

15:27.375 --> 15:28.397
You know what,

15:28.398 --> 15:29.417
my dad gave me

15:27.375 --> 15:29.417
this necklace

15:35.209 --> 15:36.918
You mean the mascot?

15:36.959 --> 15:37.959
No.

15:39.125 --> 15:40.959
What about Marco?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.022
Yeah, he's obviously

15:42.023 --> 15:43.042
into you.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.292
Maybe you guys are right.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.334
- Marco is great,
- and he does seem to like me.

15:50.167 --> 15:51.834
And her!

15:51.876 --> 15:53.000
What!

15:53.042 --> 15:54.251
That two-timing tour

15:54.252 --> 15:55.459
guide has a girlfriend?

15:56.500 --> 15:58.292
Maybe I am cursed.

15:58.334 --> 16:00.918
I'll never find true love.

16:00.959 --> 16:02.439
We didn't have to travel all

16:02.440 --> 16:03.918
the way to the Mediterranean

16:00.959 --> 16:03.918
to find that out.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.168
Many apologies, my friends,

16:08.169 --> 16:09.834
for all the interruptions.

- a cute vein on your forehead

16:12.083 --> 16:14.792
Going boom-boom-boom.

16:14.834 --> 16:15.897
Yeah, that means I either

16:15.898 --> 16:16.959
want to smack someone,

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
or it's going to rain.

16:19.834 --> 16:21.518
- Come on, kids,
- let's get back to the boat.

16:21.542 --> 16:22.855

16:22.856 --> 16:24.167
to hear the end

16:21.542 --> 16:24.167
of the necklace story?

16:24.209 --> 16:25.564
Yeah, maybe there's a way

16:25.565 --> 16:26.918
to break the curse.

16:26.959 --> 16:28.501
Right, I mean, you don't want

16:28.502 --> 16:30.042
to end up like Ravi.

16:30.083 --> 16:32.000
Hey!

16:32.042 --> 16:33.438
I will have you know

16:33.439 --> 16:34.834
I have been chatting

16:32.042 --> 16:34.834

All right. Fine.

While he still has his teeth.

16:48.167 --> 16:50.042
- So...
- Where were we?

16:51.918 --> 16:53.022
Can't I just throw this

16:53.023 --> 16:54.125
cursed necklace away?

16:54.167 --> 16:55.584

16:57.542 --> 16:58.918
No!

16:58.959 --> 17:00.001
There's only one way

17:00.002 --> 17:01.042
to lift the curse.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.563
You must place it in

17:02.564 --> 17:04.041
the Cave of

17:01.083 --> 17:04.041

17:08.083 --> 17:09.563
and no one

17:09.564 --> 17:11.041
has a problem with that.

17:11.083 --> 17:12.751
But first, you must get past

17:12.752 --> 17:14.416
the vicious lion that guards

17:11.083 --> 17:14.416
the entrance.

17:14.459 --> 17:15.730

17:15.731 --> 17:17.000

- some gladiators.

Would scrawny, smelly

17:41.000 --> 17:42.022
Remember, you must go

17:42.023 --> 17:43.042
to the back of the cave

17:43.083 --> 17:45.042
- and place the necklace
- on the marble altar.

17:45.083 --> 17:46.518
- Then wait for a large
- puff of smoke,

17:46.542 --> 17:48.375
- Which means the curse
- has been reversed.

17:48.417 --> 17:50.042
We think.

17:50.083 --> 17:51.083
Nobody's ever made

17:51.084 --> 17:52.084
it out of there alive.

17:53.564 --> 17:55.000

Huh. Thank Jupiter!
