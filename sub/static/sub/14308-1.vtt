WEBVTT

00:12.300 --> 00:15.467
- TA-DA.
WELCOME TO OUR NEW HOME.

00:15.500 --> 00:18.467
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:18.500 --> 00:21.333
- I THINK
YOU MUST HATE US.

00:21.367 --> 00:24.100
- COME ON,
I-IT'S NOT SO BAD.

00:24.133 --> 00:27.133
I KNOW IT COULD USE
A LITTLE DUSTING.

00:30.733 --> 00:33.367
A-AND SOME NEW LIGHT BULBS.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.400
- UGH.
WHAT ABOUT THAT HORRIBLE SMELL?

00:36.433 --> 00:38.300
- SORRY, THAT WAS ME.

00:38.333 --> 00:41.467
AIRPLANE LASAGNA DOES NOT
AGREE WITH ME.

00:49.833 --> 00:52.567
WHOA.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.567
- YEAH, NOTHING SAYS
"HOME, SWEET HOME"

00:54.600 --> 00:58.067
LIKE A DEAD BIRD
ON THE PIANO.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.133
- I KNOW.

00:59.167 --> 01:01.167
THIS IS THE BEST HOUSE EVER!

01:02.767 --> 01:04.567
AND DOWNSTAIRS WILL BE
THE BAKERY WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.400
- NOW, TAYLOR, I KNOW
IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT

01:07.433 --> 01:08.333
FROM OUR APARTMENT
IN NEW YORK.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.600
- BUT I THINK,
IF YOU GIVE IT A CHANCE,

01:10.633 --> 01:11.600
YOU'LL GET USED
TO IT.

01:11.633 --> 01:13.100
- MOM!

01:13.133 --> 01:16.067
- WHY IS THAT CHAIR ROCKING
BY ITSELF?

01:16.100 --> 01:21.167
- IT'S JUST THE BREEZE.
I THINK.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.067
[cat screeches and hisses,
both scream]

01:24.100 --> 01:26.067
- TAYLOR, IT'S JUST A CAT!

01:26.100 --> 01:29.400
- 'CAUSE I LOVE ANIMALS!

01:29.433 --> 01:31.700
TAY, LISTEN,

01:31.733 --> 01:36.400
THIS MOVE TO NEW ORLEANS
IS GOING TO BE GREAT FOR US.

01:36.433 --> 01:38.533
IT'S A FRESH START
AFTER THE DIVORCE.

01:38.567 --> 01:40.400
- I DIDN'T WANT
A FRESH START.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.733
- I WAS ON THE STATE CHAMPION
GYMNASTICS TEAM.

01:42.767 --> 01:44.300
I HAD MILLIONS
OF FRIENDS.

01:44.333 --> 01:45.600
NOW I'M GOING
TO BE THE NEW KID

01:45.633 --> 01:47.067
WHO NOBODY KNOWS.

01:48.433 --> 01:50.200
TWO WORDS:
FACE TATTOO.

01:50.233 --> 01:52.267
PEOPLE WILL TALK.

01:52.300 --> 01:54.733
- TAY, YOU'RE GOING
TO MAKE FRIENDS.

01:54.767 --> 01:56.500
EVERYTHING IS GOING
TO BE FINE.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.533
I'M GOING TO GO
WASH UP.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.133
- FRANKIE, WHAT WAS
THAT WEIRD NOISE?

02:03.167 --> 02:06.267
- I TOLD YOU, THAT LASAGNA'S
PUTTING UP A FIGHT.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.133
EASY, GIRL.

02:09.167 --> 02:11.567
OKAY, THAT WASN'T ME.

02:20.633 --> 02:23.567
- GHOST BOY!
MOM!

02:23.600 --> 02:26.400
- I AM LOVING
THIS HOUSE.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.500
- HEY, TOSS ME YOUR HEAD.
WE'LL PLAY CATCH.

02:43.433 --> 02:45.700
WHY AREN'T YOU RUNNING OFF
SCREAMING, LIKE YOUR SISTER?

02:45.733 --> 02:51.400
- BECAUSE YOU ARE AWESOME.

02:51.433 --> 02:52.600
I'M FRANKIE,
BY THE WAY.

02:52.633 --> 02:54.067
- LOUIE.
WAIT.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.567
NO INTRODUCTIONS.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.233
I'M A GHOST,

02:57.267 --> 02:59.533
AND I'M HERE TO SCARE YOU
OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.700
PRETTY SCARY, HUH?

03:03.733 --> 03:07.633
- NOT EXACTLY.

03:10.233 --> 03:13.500
AH, COME ON, LOUIE.
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT.

03:13.533 --> 03:15.767
- YOU ARE ADORABLE.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.133
- NO, I'M NOT.

03:17.167 --> 03:19.367
I'M MEAN AND SCARY.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.300
I'LL BE BACK.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.733
WAND, PLEASE.

03:35.333 --> 03:36.833
- MILES,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:36.867 --> 03:38.633
- A NEW FAMILY'S MOVED IN.

03:38.667 --> 03:39.800
HELLO.

03:39.833 --> 03:42.567
I'D LIKE TO MAKE
A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.567
- WE'RE GHOSTS, SON.

03:44.600 --> 03:48.100
WHEN THEY SEE YOU,
THEY'RE GONNA FREAK OUT.

03:48.133 --> 03:50.667
- NOT IF I'M WEARING
THIS SOOTHING SHADE OF LAVENDER.

03:50.700 --> 03:55.333
THIS COLOR SAYS,
"WELCOME, FRIEND."

03:55.367 --> 03:57.167
- DAD, WE GOT A PROBLEM.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.267
I JUST DID
MY HEADLESS BOY TRICK,

03:59.300 --> 04:01.667
AND THE NEW GIRL THOUGHT
IT WAS ADORABLE.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.200
"ADORABLE."
WHAT GHOST WANTS TO HEAR THAT?

04:05.233 --> 04:06.200
- ACTUALLY, I THINK
THAT'S VERY--

04:06.233 --> 04:08.467
- BESIDES YOU.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.900
- CALM DOWN, LOUIE.

04:09.933 --> 04:11.700
WE'LL FIND A WAY
TO SCARE THESE PEOPLE AWAY.

04:11.733 --> 04:13.667
- YOU GUYS
AND YOUR SCARING.

04:13.700 --> 04:16.467
HOW ABOUT, FOR ONCE,
WE STOP ACTING LIKE GHOSTS

04:16.500 --> 04:18.133
AND START ACTING
LIKE HOSTS?

04:18.167 --> 04:20.567
HUH?
WHO'S WITH ME?

04:22.900 --> 04:24.667
- WHOA...

04:24.700 --> 04:26.933
NOT COOL, LOUIE.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.167
OOH, MY LUCKY PENNY!

04:29.200 --> 04:30.867
- LOUIE.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.500
- I'M ONLY SAYING,
IT'S BEEN A WHILE

04:37.533 --> 04:38.767
SINCE I'VE HAD
SOMEONE MY OWN AGE

04:38.800 --> 04:41.067
TO HANG OUT WITH
AROUND HERE.

04:41.100 --> 04:42.267
IT COULD BE NICE.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.200
GHOSTS AREN'T NICE!

04:47.233 --> 04:49.567
DAD, THOSE WOMEN
HAVE GOT TO GO,

04:49.600 --> 04:51.333
AND I'M JUST THE GHOST
TO DO IT.

04:51.367 --> 04:53.133
- YOU WANT TO TAKE THE LEAD
ON THIS HAUNT?

04:53.167 --> 04:54.633
- YES, I DO.

04:54.667 --> 04:59.667
I'M GONNA BRING THE SCARE,
HEH HEH, LOUIE STYLE.

05:04.300 --> 05:08.467
A BANANA?
AW, MAN.

05:14.267 --> 05:16.733
- WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT
IT COULDN'T WAIT?

05:18.667 --> 05:21.833
- THE TINY GHOST CHILD
WHO WAS HOLDING HIS OWN HEAD.

05:21.867 --> 05:24.833
- SHE'S LOST IT, MOM.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.767
- MOM, I KNOW WHAT I SAW.
- I GET IT.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.467
YOU'RE GETTING BACK AT ME
FOR MAKING YOU LEAVE

05:28.500 --> 05:29.867
ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS.

05:29.900 --> 05:31.900
- UH-OH.
SHE'S ABOUT TO LOSE IT.

05:31.933 --> 05:34.333
- HERE WE GO.
THREE, TWO--

05:34.367 --> 05:36.633
- I MAY NOT BE
THE MOST PERFECT SINGLE PARENT,

05:36.667 --> 05:37.900
BUT I'M TRYING.

05:37.933 --> 05:40.333
- YES, TRYING.
- "A" FOR EFFORT.

05:40.367 --> 05:42.300
- SO I'M NOT GOOD
AT SEWING OR HOUSEWORK,

05:42.333 --> 05:45.100
AND YOU'LL BOTH PROBABLY INHERIT
MY SIZE 13 FEET.

05:45.133 --> 05:47.667
- COOL.
- PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.700
- BUT I LOVE YOU GUYS,

05:49.733 --> 05:54.433
AND I WANT THIS MOVE
TO BE A--A NEW CHAPTER FOR US.

05:54.467 --> 05:55.767
- MOM, CALM DOWN.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.200
IT WAS DARK.

06:00.233 --> 06:02.133
I WAS PROBABLY
JUST SEEING THINGS.

06:02.167 --> 06:03.767
- THAT'S MY GIRL.

06:03.800 --> 06:08.167
SORRY FOR GETTING
SO EMOTIONAL.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.367
MM. COME ON,
LET'S GET SOME SLEEP.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.700
WE HAVE A BAKERY
TO OPEN.

06:13.733 --> 06:14.733
AND REMEMBER,

06:14.767 --> 06:17.167
THERE IS NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF

06:17.200 --> 06:18.633
IN THIS HOUSE.

06:18.667 --> 06:22.200
SWEET CHRISTMAS! WITCH!

06:22.233 --> 06:23.367
- THAT'S YOU, MOM.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.133
- I KNEW THAT.

06:26.167 --> 06:27.667
EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE FINE.

06:33.367 --> 06:36.600
TAY, YOU MISSING
YOUR GYMNASTICS TEAM?

06:36.633 --> 06:38.567
- JUST A LITTLE.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.533
- AND THE CROWD
GOES WILD!

06:45.567 --> 06:50.133
ESPECIALLY THE MOM
WHO NEEDS HER TABLES WASHED.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.567
- HI, SORRY,
WE ACTUALLY OPEN TOMORROW.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.100
- OH, NO.

06:57.133 --> 06:59.300
I WAS WALKING BY
AND SAW THAT MOVE YOU JUST DID.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.700
THAT WAS AN AMAZING BACK TUCK.
- THANKS.

07:01.733 --> 07:05.333
ALTHOUGH I DID CRUSH A MUFFIN
ON MY LANDING.

07:05.367 --> 07:06.800
I'M TAYLOR.
- LILLY.

07:06.833 --> 07:07.767
YOU GUYS
JUST MOVED IN?

07:07.800 --> 07:09.167
- THAT WE DID.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.900
WELCOME TO PIE SQUARED.

07:10.933 --> 07:12.167
GET IT?

07:12.200 --> 07:14.767
ALL THE PIES
ARE SQUARE,

07:14.800 --> 07:19.400
AND IT'S ALSO A MATH TERM,
SO FUN ON TWO LEVELS.

07:19.433 --> 07:23.733
- HEY, I'M ON MY BREAK,
MRS. HATHAWAY.

07:23.767 --> 07:27.367
- WELL, WE COULD SO USE YOU
ON OUR GYMNASTICS TEAM.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.600
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE GOING
TO KIRSCHNER MIDDLE SCHOOL?

07:29.633 --> 07:31.667
- I AM.
THEY HAVE A TEAM?

07:31.700 --> 07:33.267
- YEP.
HOME OF THE FIGHTING INCHWORMS.

07:33.300 --> 07:34.733
- I WOULD LOVE
TO BE AN INCHWORM.

07:34.767 --> 07:36.467
- WELL, HEY, I COULD SWING BY
AFTER PRACTICE

07:36.500 --> 07:37.567
AND INTRODUCE YOU
TO ALL THE GIRLS.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.833
YOU'LL FIT RIGHT IN.

07:38.867 --> 07:40.733
THAT'D BE GREAT.

07:40.767 --> 07:42.433
- COOL.
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND 6:00?

07:42.467 --> 07:44.800
- GO, INCHWORMS!

07:52.200 --> 07:53.733
MOM, HUGE NEWS.

07:53.767 --> 07:55.400
THAT GIRL, LILLY,
SHE'S BRINGING OVER

07:55.433 --> 07:57.100
SOME GIRLS
FROM THE GYMNASTICS TEAM

07:57.133 --> 07:58.133
TO MEET ME LATER.

07:58.167 --> 07:59.367
- GREAT.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.467
OH, BE SURE
TO PUSH THE DONUTS.

08:00.500 --> 08:03.867
THEY'RE SQUARE, TOO.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.933
DON'T JUDGE ME.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.700
- PLEASE DON'T BE SCARED.

08:21.733 --> 08:24.567
- OKAY,
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.400
YOU'RE A GHOST
IN A LAVENDER SHIRT.

08:27.433 --> 08:29.733
- IT'S SOOTHING,
RIGHT?

08:29.767 --> 08:32.433
TAY, RELAX.

08:32.467 --> 08:33.833
I'M A GOOD GHOST.

08:33.867 --> 08:35.200
THE NAME'S MILES,

08:35.233 --> 08:37.233
RHYMES WITH "SMILES."

08:37.267 --> 08:42.267
- I'M TAYLOR, RHYMES WITH
"GET ME OUT OF HERE."

08:42.300 --> 08:44.767
- LOOK, LET ME GIVE YOU
THE 411 ON MILES PRESTON.

08:44.800 --> 08:48.567
I'M INTO JOURNALING,
BACKGAMMON, AND DANCING.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.200
HEY!
WHAT? HEY!

08:51.233 --> 08:53.233
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A BLAST TOGETHER.

08:53.267 --> 08:55.400
- UH-HUH.
SURE.

08:55.433 --> 08:57.633
MOTHER!

08:57.667 --> 08:59.333
MOM, I KNEW
I WASN'T SEEING THINGS.

08:59.367 --> 09:00.400
THIS HOUSE IS HAUNTED.

09:00.433 --> 09:01.533
OH, MY GOSH.

09:02.567 --> 09:06.267
- THAT'S CLAY BANNISTER.

09:06.300 --> 09:07.433
- AFTERNOON.

09:07.467 --> 09:08.833
I'M CLAY BANNISTER,

09:08.867 --> 09:11.333
FOOD CRITIC
FOR THE TASTE OF NEW ORLEANS.

09:11.367 --> 09:14.267
YES,
THAT CLAY BANNISTER.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.600
- MR. BANNISTER,
THANKS FOR COMING.

09:16.633 --> 09:20.567
OH, A GOOD REVIEW FROM YOU
WOULD BE HUGE.

09:20.600 --> 09:25.167
UH, LET ME GRAB YOU
SOME PIE TO SAMPLE.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.533
- MOM, DID YOU HEAR
A WORD I SAID?

09:26.567 --> 09:29.233
- THAT'S NICE, DEAR.

09:31.300 --> 09:32.267
- ALL RIGHT.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.667
TIME TO GET MY SCARE ON.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.167
- HEY, LOUIE.

09:37.200 --> 09:42.900
DON'T DO THAT.
YOU REALLY SCARED ME.

09:45.867 --> 09:48.767
- NO, ONLY PEOPLE
WHO LIVE IN THE HOUSE CAN.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.667
NOW, CAN YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?

09:50.700 --> 09:54.200
- I WAS THINKING I CAN GIVE YOU
A FEW TIPS ON SCARING PEOPLE.

09:54.233 --> 09:57.633
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
I SENSE YOU'RE STRUGGLING.

09:58.700 --> 10:00.933
WELL, WATCH THIS.

10:05.267 --> 10:07.633
I DON'T GET IT.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO--

10:07.667 --> 10:11.367
SCARY CLOWN!

10:11.400 --> 10:12.733
- YAY!

10:16.533 --> 10:18.800
- HE WAS THERE A MINUTE AGO,
I PROMISE.

10:18.833 --> 10:20.633
- HERE WE GO,
MR. BANNISTER.

10:20.667 --> 10:23.800
ONE FRESH APPLE WALNUT.

10:23.833 --> 10:26.500
FINGERS CROSSED.

10:26.533 --> 10:32.267
- NAPKIN, PLEASE.
I'M NOT AN ANIMAL.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.633
- SORRY, DAD.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.700
PRETTY WEAK SCARE, HUH?

10:36.733 --> 10:38.567
- HEY, YOU'LL GET THERE, SON.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.200
NOW, YOU WANT TO SEE
YOUR OLD MAN IN ACTION?

10:41.233 --> 10:42.700
- OH, YEAH.

10:47.700 --> 10:51.600
- WELL, I MUST SAY--

10:55.367 --> 10:56.533
HUH! OH, MY.

10:56.567 --> 10:59.333
THIS IS GOING
TO GET VERY UNPLEASANT.

11:14.467 --> 11:16.567
- MOM,
THE MAN'S POSSESSED.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.167
ADMIT IT.
WE'VE GOT GHOSTS.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.167
- TAYLOR, JUST BECAUSE
WE'VE SEEN SOME WEIRD THINGS

11:20.200 --> 11:21.167
DOESN'T MEAN--

11:30.167 --> 11:31.633
- YEAH.
WE'VE GOT GHOSTS.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.400
- NO ONE SCARES OFF
AN IMPORTANT FOOD CRITIC

11:41.433 --> 11:42.567
AND MESSES
WITH MY BUSINESS.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.300
THIS COULD GET UGLY, GIRLS.

11:48.867 --> 11:50.500
HOLY MOLEY!
THOSE ARE GHOSTS!

11:50.533 --> 11:52.667
DON'T BE SCARED,
LITTLE ONES.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.300
MOMMY'S HERE.

11:54.333 --> 11:57.267
- HEY,
THERE'S THE "L" DOG.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.267
DAP IT.

12:00.300 --> 12:03.567
- NO.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

12:03.600 --> 12:06.367
- OKAY, I'M SENSING
A LOT OF TENSION HERE.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.633
WAIT, YOU KNOW
WHAT WE NEED?

12:09.733 --> 12:11.900
- INTRODUCTIONS.

12:11.933 --> 12:14.233
LET'S GO AROUND THE ROOM
AND EACH GIVE OUR NAME

12:14.267 --> 12:16.600
AND ONE INTERESTING FACT
ABOUT OURSELVES.

12:16.633 --> 12:20.333
I'M MILES.
I'M ALLERGIC TO TAFFY.

12:20.367 --> 12:22.200
- WELL, I'M RAY,

12:22.233 --> 12:23.700
BUT IT REALLY
DOESN'T MATTER,

12:23.733 --> 12:26.600
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE IN OUR HOUSE MUCH LONGER.

12:26.633 --> 12:28.733
- YEAH, YOU PEOPLE NEED
TO PACK UP AND GO

12:28.767 --> 12:31.133
BEFORE I LOSE
MY TEMPER.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.300
- WHEN HE GETS WORKED UP,
HE PUTS ON AN EVENING GOWN.

12:34.333 --> 12:36.133
- PEOPLE, FOCUS.

12:36.167 --> 12:38.700
YOU THINK I WANTED TO MOVE
INTO THIS HOUSE OF HORRORS?

12:38.733 --> 12:40.900
I LEFT BEHIND
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

12:40.933 --> 12:42.633
- YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

12:42.667 --> 12:45.600
IT'S ALL IN HER DIARY...

12:45.633 --> 12:49.933
WHICH I DID NOT
ACCIDENTALLY READ.

12:49.967 --> 12:51.500
- UNBELIEVABLE.

12:51.533 --> 12:53.867
I FINALLY GOT A CHANCE
TO MAKE FRIENDS HERE,

12:53.900 --> 12:55.133
BUT I HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT A BUNCH

12:55.167 --> 12:56.567
OF STUPID GHOSTS
RUINING IT?

12:56.600 --> 13:00.567
- WAH, WAH, WAH.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.767
- ZIP IT, TINY TIM.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.267
BIG PEOPLE ARE TALKING.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.433
- OH, OH-OH.

13:05.467 --> 13:08.233
OH, NO.
YOU DID NOT JUST GO THERE.

13:08.267 --> 13:10.700
SO LET'S DO THIS.

13:13.967 --> 13:17.633
I'M A RABBIT, AREN'T I?

13:17.667 --> 13:20.900
- UH, HE'S STILL LEARNING.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.300
- LISTEN CLOSELY.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.633
YOU'VE GOT 20 MINUTES

13:23.667 --> 13:25.133
TO PACK YOUR THINGS
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

13:25.167 --> 13:27.333
YOU GOT THAT,
SAXOPHONE STU?

13:27.367 --> 13:30.433
GOOD SLAM, RIGHT?
'CAUSE HIS NAME'S RAY.

13:30.467 --> 13:33.767
- OKAY,
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.933
HOPE YOU GOT
YOUR MITTENS.

13:36.967 --> 13:38.433
THAT'S YOUR COMEBACK?

13:38.467 --> 13:40.433
IT'S 80 DEGREES OUTSIDE.

13:41.667 --> 13:45.267
OKAY! THE MITTENS
MAKE SENSE NOW!

13:45.300 --> 13:47.167
SCORE ONE FOR RAY!

13:47.200 --> 13:48.900
- THANK YOU!

13:48.933 --> 13:53.200
- WHOO-HOO!
I'M KING OF THE WORLD!

13:53.233 --> 13:54.833
- THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.233
I HAVE TO CANCEL
WITH LILLY.

13:56.267 --> 13:57.600
- YOU ARE NOT
CANCELLING ANYTHING.

13:57.633 --> 13:59.600
I'M CALLING IN
A GHOST EXTERMINATOR.

13:59.633 --> 14:00.667
both: CAT!

14:05.267 --> 14:08.433
- DOKARA!
CASSIMMI!

14:08.467 --> 14:10.600
WOPATINA!

14:10.633 --> 14:12.367
- WELL, IF THE GHOSTS DON'T
SCARE OFF MY FRIENDS,

14:12.400 --> 14:13.733
THIS GHOST BUSTER WILL.

14:13.767 --> 14:15.300
- SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

14:15.333 --> 14:16.667
SHE CAME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

14:16.700 --> 14:19.900
FROM THE MAN OUTSIDE
WHO TALKS TO HIS HAND.

14:19.933 --> 14:23.767
- DOKARA!
CASSIMMI!

14:23.800 --> 14:25.633
WOPATINA!

14:25.667 --> 14:27.900
- UM, IF THIS
IS THE BABYSITTER,

14:27.933 --> 14:30.567
I'D LIKE
TO SEE REFERENCES.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.600
- NOPE, SHE'S HERE
TO GET RID OF OUR GHOST PROBLEM.

14:32.633 --> 14:34.900
- NOT IF I HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT IT.

14:34.933 --> 14:36.733
YO, LADY.
WE NEED TO TALK.

14:39.267 --> 14:42.767
- YOU'RE BUSY.
I GET IT.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.667
- OH, MAN, THE GIRLS ARE GONNA
BE HERE IN TEN MINUTES.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.633
I JUST WON'T
OPEN THE DOOR.

14:47.667 --> 14:48.700
- NO, I TOLD YOU,
YOU'RE NOT CANCELLING,

14:48.733 --> 14:49.767
AND YOU'RE NOT.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.700
GO.
I'VE GOT THIS.

14:51.733 --> 14:53.333
IT'S ALL GOOD.

14:53.367 --> 14:54.833
- OH, NO.
THIS IS BAD.

14:54.867 --> 14:57.267
VERY BAD.

14:57.300 --> 15:00.867
- I'M FEELING
STRANGE VIBRATIONS.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.267
WAIT.
OH, IT'S JUST A TEXT.

15:11.933 --> 15:13.833
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:13.867 --> 15:15.867
YOU SHOULD BE.

15:15.900 --> 15:19.233
I'M HERE TO TAKE YOU DOWN,
TAYLOR.

15:19.267 --> 15:22.167
IN PING-PONG.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.500
- LOOK, MILES, YOU SEEM
LIKE A VERY NICE...

15:24.533 --> 15:26.233
WHATEVER YOU ARE,

15:26.267 --> 15:27.633
BUT I'VE GOT A CHANCE
TO MAKE ACTUAL FRIENDS HERE,

15:27.667 --> 15:30.267
SO DO YOUR LITTLE GHOST THING
AND DISAPPEAR.

15:30.300 --> 15:31.800
- I GET IT.
YOU HAVE PLANS.

15:31.833 --> 15:33.200
WELL, THE LEAST I CAN DO
IS HELP

15:33.233 --> 15:36.433
AFTER MY FAMILY
MADE SUCH A MESS.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.767
NOT BAD,
RIGHT?

15:42.800 --> 15:43.833
I CLEANED THE WHOLE BAKERY
AND--

15:47.400 --> 15:50.800
- WAXED THE KITCHEN FLOOR.
SORRY.

15:50.833 --> 15:54.200
- MILES.

15:54.233 --> 15:55.900
I HAVE ICING
IN MY HAIR.

15:57.767 --> 15:59.433
- OH, NO.
THEY'RE HERE.

15:59.467 --> 16:02.367
- DON'T WORRY.
I CAN FIX THIS.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.933
IT WILL ONLY
TAKE A SECOND.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.633
[hairdryer blowing,
scissors snipping]

16:23.900 --> 16:25.500
I LOOK LIKE THE BRIDE
OF FRANKENSTEIN.

16:26.833 --> 16:28.767
- NO, YOU'VE DONE
ENOUGH DAMAGE.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.667
JUST STAY AWAY FROM ME.
GOT IT?

16:40.700 --> 16:44.133
ANOTHER FAKE GHOST BUSTER?
HA!

16:44.167 --> 16:46.700
WE'RE SO SCARED.

16:46.733 --> 16:47.867
- WOPATINA.

16:49.767 --> 16:51.533
- LET'S GO
BACK UPSTAIRS, SON.

16:54.767 --> 16:57.667
- SCORE ONE
FOR MICHELLE.

16:57.700 --> 17:01.967
- ONE MORE TIME.
- YEAH.

17:02.067 --> 17:03.900
UH-OH.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.233
- THERE THEY ARE.

17:09.267 --> 17:12.133
- HEY, TAYLOR.
ARE YOU--

17:12.167 --> 17:13.933
EVERYTHING OKAY?

17:13.967 --> 17:17.267
- YEAH.
JUST A BAD HAIR DAY.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.800
YOU GUYS MUST BE THE REST
OF THE GYMNASTICS TEAM.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.567
COME ON IN.

17:23.600 --> 17:26.200
- YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING
ON YOUR NOSE THERE.

17:26.233 --> 17:28.867
HUH. WEIRD.

17:28.900 --> 17:32.200
- SO THIS IS SUSAN,
ANNE, AND KIMBER.

17:32.233 --> 17:33.567
SUSAN IS ALSO
FROM NEW YORK,

17:33.600 --> 17:35.133
AND KIMBER IS SUPER
INTO BAKING,

17:35.167 --> 17:36.867
SO EVERYONE COULDN'T WAIT
TO MEET YOU.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.667
THAT IS SO COOL.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.833
SO, SO COOL.
I MEAN, WHO DOESN'T LIKE BAKING?

17:40.867 --> 17:42.667
OH, MY GOSH, I LOVE BAKING!
BAKING IS AMAZING!

17:42.700 --> 17:47.167
WHO DOESN'T LIKE BAKING?
SO COOL.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.700
SO, SUSAN, WHERE IN NEW YORK
ARE YOU FROM?

17:52.200 --> 17:55.567
- GOOD TOWN, GOOD TOWN.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.333
WHO WANTS LEMONADE?

17:58.367 --> 18:01.767
- SURE.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.600
SO I WAS TELLING THE GIRLS

18:03.633 --> 18:05.433
ABOUT THAT KILLER
GYMNASTICS MOVE I SAW YOU DO.

18:05.467 --> 18:07.900
- OH, LILLY'S JUST
BEING NICE.

18:07.933 --> 18:10.467
ALTHOUGH MY OLD COACH
DID NICKNAME ME "STICK,"

18:10.500 --> 18:13.700
'CAUSE I'M SO SURE-FOOTED
AND ALWAYS NAILED MY--

18:19.167 --> 18:21.233
LANDINGS.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.567
- SORRY.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.733
I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED
I WAXED THAT SPOT, TOO.

18:24.767 --> 18:26.400
- GO AWAY.

18:26.433 --> 18:29.233
- NO.

18:29.267 --> 18:32.433
I'M TALKING
TO MYSELF.

18:32.467 --> 18:34.833
- I'M GETTING
A LITTLE FREAKED OUT HERE.

18:34.867 --> 18:38.167
- UM, TAYLOR, I THINK
WE'RE JUST GONNA LEAVE.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.767
- CAN'T SAY
I BLAME YOU.

18:40.800 --> 18:41.867
- UM, OKAY.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.867
WELL, SEE YOU IN SCHOOL.

18:43.900 --> 18:45.967
- YEP.
CAN'T WAIT.

18:49.933 --> 18:51.933
- UM, THE DOOR'S LOCKED.

18:51.967 --> 18:53.867
- I'LL GET IT.

19:03.867 --> 19:06.067
- DID YOU SEE
THAT LAYOUT?

19:07.800 --> 19:08.967
TAY, YOU HAVE
TO COME WITH US

19:09.067 --> 19:10.633
TO THE GYM
TOMORROW AFTER SCHOOL.

19:10.667 --> 19:11.833
PROMISE?

19:11.867 --> 19:15.433
- I PROMISE.
THANKS, GUYS.

19:15.467 --> 19:16.967
FIGHTING INCHWORMS!

19:23.500 --> 19:25.667
YAY!

19:25.700 --> 19:27.833
- CONGRATULATIONS,
TAYLOR.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.433
SORRY I ALMOST
MESSED IT UP FOR YOU.

19:31.733 --> 19:33.867
YOU SAVED IT
FOR ME.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.233
THANKS, MILES.

19:35.267 --> 19:36.767
- YOU GOT IT.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.333
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO WANT TO MAKE A FRIEND.

19:39.367 --> 19:44.300
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.400
MAYBE YOU AND I
CAN BE FRIENDS.

19:47.433 --> 19:49.767
I'D LIKE THAT.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.967
HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
TAYLOR?

20:00.467 --> 20:03.600
- THEY'RE ALL HERE.
IT'S TIME.

20:05.333 --> 20:07.600
- MOM, PLEASE.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

20:07.633 --> 20:10.233
- I'M SORRY, HONEY.
IT HAS TO HAPPEN.

20:10.267 --> 20:12.600
- ISN'T THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO?

20:12.633 --> 20:14.500
- AFRAID NOT.

20:14.533 --> 20:17.400
ONLY THING LEFT TO DO
IS SAY BYE TO OUR HOME.

20:17.433 --> 20:20.633
A LOT OF GOOD MEMORIES HERE
WITH YOU BOYS.

20:20.667 --> 20:22.200
- WAIT.
CALL OFF THE SPELL.

20:22.233 --> 20:23.633
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"CALL OFF THE SPELL"?

20:23.667 --> 20:25.567
YOU WANTED THEM GONE
MORE THAN ANY OF US.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.833
- I WAS WRONG.

20:26.867 --> 20:27.833
THEY AREN'T JUST
A BUNCH OF GHOSTS.

20:27.867 --> 20:29.233
THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE.

20:29.267 --> 20:30.633
MILES JUST REALLY
HELPED ME OUT.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.667
- BUT CHILDREN SHOULDN'T BE
AROUND GHOSTS.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.200
I MEAN,
THAT'S PARENTING 101.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.667
I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE A GOOD MOM.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.700
- THEN TRUST ME
AND SAVE THEM.

20:38.733 --> 20:41.300
- PLEASE HELP US.
- COME ON.

20:41.333 --> 20:42.767
- AH, PLEASE.
WE'LL DO ANYTHING.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.167
- TAYLOR.
- OKAY, YOU'RE--YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.267
I CAN'T DO THIS.

20:45.300 --> 20:47.267
SHUT IT DOWN,
STICK LADY.

20:47.300 --> 20:48.833
- FINE.

20:48.867 --> 20:51.633
I GET PAID EITHER WAY.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.733
GHOSTUS RESURECTUS.

20:56.267 --> 20:57.900
- IT'S NOT WORKING.

20:57.933 --> 20:59.467
GIVE ME THAT.

20:59.500 --> 21:00.900
- OHH!

21:02.667 --> 21:03.867
- TAY, YOU DID IT.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.533
THEY'RE COMING BACK.

21:05.567 --> 21:08.633
- YOU SMASHED
MY MAGIC ORB.

21:08.667 --> 21:12.367
YOU OWE ME 6 BUCKS.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.300
- WHEW! MY ARMS.

21:14.333 --> 21:15.500
OH, YEAH.

21:15.533 --> 21:17.600
THE FLESH CANNONS
HAVE RETURNED.

21:20.700 --> 21:22.867
I HAVE MY LEGS!
I HAVE MY LEGS!

21:22.900 --> 21:25.567
I CAN DANCE AGAIN.
OOH.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.267
all: YAY.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.867
- YEAH.

21:30.900 --> 21:33.167
- TAYLOR, THANKS
FOR HAVING MY BACK.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.333
- OF COURSE.
WE'RE FRIENDS, RIGHT?

21:35.367 --> 21:38.533
- SO I HAVE NO CLUE
HOW THIS'LL WORK--

21:38.567 --> 21:40.200
TWO FAMILIES,
ONE HOUSE--

21:40.233 --> 21:42.333
BUT WE'RE WILLING TO TRY
IF YOU ARE.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.233
- YEAH.
- WE ARE.

21:44.267 --> 21:45.833
- YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

21:45.867 --> 21:48.300
FOR NOW.

21:48.333 --> 21:49.533
- DID THE LITTLE ONE
JUST SAY "FOR NOW"?

21:49.567 --> 21:51.900
I-I THINK HE JUST SAID
"FOR NOW."

21:59.500 --> 22:02.500
- THIS IS...NICE.

22:06.567 --> 22:07.800
- HEY, I KNOW.

22:07.833 --> 22:10.233
WHY DON'T WE ALL
GO AROUND THE ROOM AND--

22:10.267 --> 22:12.233
all: NO.

22:12.267 --> 22:13.933
- I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

22:13.967 --> 22:15.633
I'M TAYLOR,
AND I THINK

22:15.667 --> 22:17.467
LIVING WITH GHOSTS
WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.067
- BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

22:19.067 --> 22:22.233
WHO WANTS TURKEY?

22:23.833 --> 22:27.300
- THEN AGAIN, MAYBE NOT.

22:27.333 --> 22:30.533
- LOUIE.

22:30.567 --> 22:33.233
NOT BAD, SON.

22:33.267 --> 22:36.067
- THIS IS GOING
TO BE AWESOME.

22:36.067 --> 22:40.267
*
