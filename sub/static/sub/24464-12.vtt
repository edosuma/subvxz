00:12.920 --> 00:16.010
Muscle Man, there is no way you're gonna pull this off.

00:16.010 --> 00:18.180
I swear, I've done it, before.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.070
Watch me!

00:41.850 --> 00:43.850
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!!

00:43.850 --> 00:44.580
We were just...

00:44.580 --> 00:46.900
WHY WOULD YOU LIGHT UP ALL THE FIREWORKS

00:46.900 --> 00:49.460
BEFORE THE BIGGEST EVENT OF THE YEAR?!

00:49.460 --> 00:50.910
Just hang on now, Benson.

00:50.930 --> 00:53.720
I know this looks bad, but I can fix it.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.780
Fix it?! FIX WHAT?!!

00:55.820 --> 00:58.150
YOU JUST RUINED THE 4TH OF JULY!

00:58.200 --> 01:00.440
I know, I know. Just hear me out.

01:00.590 --> 01:03.990
I know a guy who's got the hook up a cheap fireworks.

01:03.990 --> 01:05.690
I DON'T WANT CHEAP FIREWORKS!

01:05.690 --> 01:08.730
THAT STUFF YOU JUST BLEW UP WAS TOP OF THE LINE!

01:08.770 --> 01:11.270
Benson, trust me. This guy's stuff is quality.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.270
I'll pay for it out of my own pocket.

01:13.290 --> 01:14.390
Alright, fine.

01:14.550 --> 01:18.080
But if you guys aren't back before the show starts at sundown,

01:18.080 --> 01:19.160
YOU'RE FIRED!

01:21.740 --> 01:24.540
Dude, you better to be able to get those fireworks.

01:24.540 --> 01:26.210
Don't worry, we'll get 'em.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.790
Dude! No way,

01:32.790 --> 01:35.330
is this where they make South of the Line chile rellenos?

01:35.330 --> 01:37.180
Oh yeah! I've heard about those.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.730
These are the really spicy ones right?

01:38.760 --> 01:41.080
Yeah, my boy Hector runs this place.

01:41.090 --> 01:42.720
So they sell fireworks here?

01:42.720 --> 01:45.610
Yeah, but it's just a little business he's got goin' on inside.

01:45.620 --> 01:47.210
So keep in under DL.

01:47.490 --> 01:51.100
Alright, just stay put and don't go anywhere!

01:51.140 --> 01:52.400
I'll be right back.

02:00.900 --> 02:03.400
Are you lookin' for somethin' friend?

02:04.230 --> 02:05.990
I'm here to see Hector.

02:07.920 --> 02:08.759
Oh man.

02:08.789 --> 02:09.930
Let go of me!

02:10.120 --> 02:11.360
Dude, what's goin' on!

02:11.360 --> 02:13.570
Just keep your mouth shut!

02:17.970 --> 02:19.660
Hey, Hector.

02:23.910 --> 02:25.680
Muscle Man!

02:25.710 --> 02:27.560
It's good to see you...

02:27.560 --> 02:29.560
Why don't you never come to visit me, huh?

02:29.560 --> 02:30.070
I...

02:30.180 --> 02:31.470
Who are your friends?

02:31.510 --> 02:33.180
Oh it's just a couple of...

02:33.730 --> 02:35.390
friends from The Park.

02:36.730 --> 02:39.380
Well welcome, friends from The Park.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.800
- Hey, dude. - Nice to meet you.

02:41.810 --> 02:43.640
So, tell me.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.530
What do I owe dis pleasure?

02:46.550 --> 02:47.680
Ah, let me guess!

02:47.710 --> 02:51.290
You're here for some of the world's spiciest chile rellenos!

02:51.900 --> 02:53.140
Thanks Hector.

02:53.330 --> 02:56.090
But, we were actually wondering if we could get some...

02:56.540 --> 02:57.800
fireworks.

02:58.970 --> 02:59.810
Some what?

03:00.660 --> 03:02.410
Just some fireworks.

03:03.540 --> 03:05.390
I don't think I heard him correctly,

03:05.500 --> 03:06.820
did you hear what he just said?

03:06.820 --> 03:09.480
He said fireworks.

03:10.050 --> 03:11.290
Fireworks.

03:13.030 --> 03:15.450
YOU COME HERE ASKIN' FOR FIREWORKS ON THE FOURTH OF JULY!!!

03:17.290 --> 03:21.190
Look, we screwed up, and blew all of our fireworks by accident.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.430
So, you think you can come to your uncle Hector,

03:23.430 --> 03:24.930
and bare you out huh!

03:25.350 --> 03:26.320
I understand.

03:26.730 --> 03:29.330
People make mistakes, and I'm a reasonable man.

03:35.490 --> 03:36.980
Does this please you?

03:36.980 --> 03:39.630
- Yeah! - That's perfect. Thank you Hector.

03:39.630 --> 03:40.870
Then hand it over.

03:42.220 --> 03:43.470
Where is the rest?

03:43.470 --> 03:45.250
What do you mean? It's all there.

03:45.270 --> 03:49.180
But these are last minute fireworks, it's gonna cost you double!

03:49.270 --> 03:50.830
But that is all we have!

03:50.830 --> 03:53.150
It's one box minimum. You can't afford it,

03:53.150 --> 03:55.260
then get out of my place of business!

03:55.260 --> 03:57.460
How 'bout you just give us that one big one over there.

04:01.060 --> 04:02.510
You want to buy El Diablo?

04:02.550 --> 04:05.170
Let me tell you a little story about El Diablo.

04:05.300 --> 04:08.080
It has been prophesized that if it is ever lit,

04:08.200 --> 04:09.230
it will kill me.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.010
So no, it is not for sale!

04:13.020 --> 04:14.660
C'mon Hector, please!

04:14.670 --> 04:18.269
You gotta hook us up with the fireworks! We'll do anything!

04:18.950 --> 04:21.470
Get off of me you filthy dog!

04:21.529 --> 04:22.310
Alright!

04:22.690 --> 04:24.590
You want the fireworks so bad!

04:24.730 --> 04:25.330
Here!

04:26.340 --> 04:29.240
If you deliver this package with no questions asked?

04:29.600 --> 04:31.680
I will give you that box of fireworks!

04:31.680 --> 04:34.170
Oh Thank You Hector! Thank You!

04:37.950 --> 04:39.790
Alright! Let's do this.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.790
Can I help you?

04:42.840 --> 04:46.270
We're here to deliver a package for Armando.

04:50.060 --> 04:51.870
What's the matter with you?! I got a club in here!

04:51.870 --> 04:53.250
You guys have any money?!

04:53.700 --> 04:54.250
What?!

04:54.290 --> 04:55.950
- Armando. - Yeah!

04:56.000 --> 04:58.630
Package delivery from Hector.

04:59.320 --> 05:00.260
Then come on in!

05:02.480 --> 05:05.320
Just wait here for a minute. I got something for you to deliver to Hector.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.730
We kinda have to get going.

05:09.730 --> 05:11.320
Yeah have a seat!

05:12.000 --> 05:13.320
Yeah have a seat.

05:14.030 --> 05:16.190
Keep going ladies why are you so lazy?!

05:22.180 --> 05:23.350
Nice doggy!

05:23.880 --> 05:25.610
Forget this I'm going to find this dude.

05:25.610 --> 05:27.850
- Rigby wait! - Dude! No! Don't!

05:41.630 --> 05:45.360
You're putting gunpowder in the South of the Line chile rellenos!

05:45.360 --> 05:46.620
I told you to wait!

05:49.580 --> 05:50.680
Dude! What's goin' on?!

05:57.830 --> 05:59.660
Tisk, Tisk, Tisk!

05:59.800 --> 06:02.850
Looks like somebody stopped their nauces somewhere they don't belong!

06:02.870 --> 06:04.600
Hector, we can explain!

06:04.600 --> 06:07.300
No! Let me explain something to you amigo.

06:07.410 --> 06:11.980
The FDA allows zero percent gunpowder in each chile relleno.

06:12.180 --> 06:13.940
Do you know how much gunpowder

06:13.940 --> 06:16.070
is in each South of the Line chile relleno?

06:16.330 --> 06:18.250
500%!

06:19.190 --> 06:21.680
We're not gonna tell the FDA Hector!

06:21.680 --> 06:23.910
I know you're not gonna tell the FDA,

06:24.130 --> 06:27.950
'cuz we're gonna blow you into a million little Muscle Man pieces!

06:29.540 --> 06:31.700
Hector! You don't have to do this!

06:31.700 --> 06:34.170
Oh don't worry! It's no trouble really!

06:37.040 --> 06:38.550
Happy Fourth of July!

06:44.910 --> 06:48.160
Muscle Man, how do you even know this guy!

06:48.160 --> 06:50.260
Yeah, you got us into this Muscle Man!

06:50.260 --> 06:51.740
What are we gonna do?!

06:53.760 --> 06:57.360
I got an idea, follow my lead! Stand!

06:58.140 --> 06:59.590
Now turn around!

07:01.590 --> 07:03.210
Lets stop them!

07:03.760 --> 07:05.030
C'mon! C'mon!

07:09.150 --> 07:09.950
Lets go.

07:09.950 --> 07:11.050
Give me the keys!

07:17.360 --> 07:18.880
Lets go! Lets go!

07:19.640 --> 07:20.560
Get them!

07:34.470 --> 07:35.820
We're not going to make it.

07:41.550 --> 07:43.790
Hey! Whats going on? Why arent they starting yet?

07:43.790 --> 07:45.070
Yeah! It's sundown.

07:47.610 --> 07:51.030
I'm going to ask you to please remain patient.

07:51.030 --> 07:53.790
The fireworks show will commence shortly.

07:56.970 --> 07:58.710
I know we couldn't trust them!

08:06.180 --> 08:07.710
Where have you guys been?

08:07.710 --> 08:09.880
I told you to come before the show.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.080
Sorry it took so long.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.080
We're good to go! Round em and stack em!

08:13.360 --> 08:16.460
Wait, wheres the rest of the fireworks?

08:16.460 --> 08:17.870
This is all we could get.

08:17.870 --> 08:20.340
You guys only got one firework?

08:20.340 --> 08:22.340
Thats not just any firework

08:22.340 --> 08:23.680
This wasnt the deal!

08:23.730 --> 08:26.100
You guys were supposed to replace the ones

08:26.100 --> 08:27.610
that you set off this morning.

08:27.640 --> 08:31.010
Thats it! Ill call it off. You guys are all fired!

08:31.100 --> 08:33.100
Oh, come on Benson!

08:36.720 --> 08:37.900
Hand it over

08:39.650 --> 08:40.780
WHO ARE YOU?

08:40.840 --> 08:44.280
I'm the guy whose business your employees just destroyed

08:44.300 --> 08:48.910
and I'm also the guy that's gonna blow you all sky-high with this,

08:49.900 --> 08:52.540
starting with you HEPE.

08:53.390 --> 08:55.000
Men! What are we going to do?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.190
I think I got an idea.

08:59.450 --> 09:00.330
Hey Hector!

09:01.060 --> 09:05.310
Your chili rellenos are the least spiciest chili rellenos in the world.

09:06.290 --> 09:07.080
WHAT!

09:07.110 --> 09:09.240
Yeah! They're not even world-renowned

09:09.730 --> 09:12.320
Noone's even heard about them, Hector!

09:12.360 --> 09:15.220
And all the people who have heard about them

09:15.230 --> 09:17.140
don't even think they're spicy.

09:17.140 --> 09:20.760
SOUTH OF THE LINE CHILI RELLENOS ARE THE SPICIEST,

09:20.790 --> 09:25.580
MOST WORLD-RENOWNED CHILI RELLENOS IN THE WORLD!

09:27.420 --> 09:28.270
NOW!

09:29.360 --> 09:32.370
NO, THE PROPHECY!

09:42.750 --> 09:47.020
She's even more beautiful than I could ever imagined.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.710
Hector!

10:02.110 --> 10:03.620
No!

10:31.880 --> 10:33.050
Alright, you guys,

10:33.200 --> 10:37.170
somehow you managed to top last year's firework show.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.000
So I guess I'm not gonna fire you.

10:40.340 --> 10:44.860
In fact, I'm putting you four in charge of a very special job.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.810
Oh, cool! What special job?

10:46.820 --> 10:51.440
Replacing the three football field or the grass you just burnt!

10:53.150 --> 10:58.780
Don't worry, I know a guy who's got the hook up on real cheap field.
