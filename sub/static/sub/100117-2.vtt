WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:02.959
This isn't how the story
is supposed to end.

00:03.003 --> 00:03.960
This isn't just a story.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.135
It's our lives!

00:05.179 --> 00:06.832
So God or no God,
you go to Hell.

00:06.876 --> 00:08.051
Fine!

00:14.318 --> 00:16.364
Hey, Chuck!

00:16.407 --> 00:17.582
Aah!

00:17.626 --> 00:19.323
Chuck: Story's over.
Welcome to The End.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.803
Dean: What the hell
is happening?!

00:20.846 --> 00:22.979
Cass: Souls from Hell.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.981
Cass: That's not Jack.
That's a demon.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.156
How in the hell?

00:26.200 --> 00:28.854
Uh, hi.
Uh, my name is Belphegor.

00:28.898 --> 00:30.682
I said get out of him.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.032
No. I can help.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.772
If you wanted
to buy some time,

00:33.816 --> 00:34.860
you could always
contain the ghosts.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.079
Contain them how?

00:36.123 --> 00:37.733
Imagine a salt circle
a mile wide.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.996
No ghosts get in,
no ghosts get out.

00:45.610 --> 00:46.698
Sam: Let's go.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.432
Ugh.

01:35.878 --> 01:37.488
Oh.

01:37.532 --> 01:38.881
Rob.

01:38.924 --> 01:41.318
You didn't evacuate.

01:41.362 --> 01:43.451
And you seem to
be breathing fine.

01:43.494 --> 01:46.628
You ask me, this whole
"benzine leak" sounds phony.

01:46.671 --> 01:49.500
Everyone's been camped out
at the high school for two days.

01:49.544 --> 01:52.938
I just snuck back to get
Debbie's allergy meds.

01:52.982 --> 01:54.157
All this going on,

01:54.201 --> 01:56.159
and you know what
she's worried about?

01:56.203 --> 01:59.031
That they'll cancel
the school spelling bee.

01:59.075 --> 02:02.034
She studied
her butt off for it.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.429
Do you, uh...

02:05.473 --> 02:08.128
Do you -- Do you think they'll
cancel the spelling bee?

02:09.520 --> 02:10.565
Rob?

02:12.219 --> 02:13.307
Rob?

02:33.414 --> 02:34.806
Disembowel.

02:34.850 --> 02:39.159
D-i-s-e-m-b-o-w-e-l.

02:39.202 --> 02:41.378
Disembowel.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.218
I just don't know how much
longer we can control them.

02:55.262 --> 02:56.785
I don't think they're
buying the benzine story.

02:56.828 --> 02:59.875
I think -- One man told me his
wife, she's gone missing and --

02:59.918 --> 03:01.398
Wait, wait. What?

03:01.442 --> 03:02.269
Who?

03:02.312 --> 03:04.314
He said her name
was Nan.

03:06.664 --> 03:08.318
Alright, we'll find her.

03:08.362 --> 03:11.191
Will you tell the Hunters in
the zone to keep an eye out?

03:11.234 --> 03:13.976
Got it.
Thank you.

03:16.587 --> 03:18.198
Give me a minute.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.817
C-Can I have your attention?

03:28.860 --> 03:30.166
'Scuse me!

03:30.210 --> 03:31.994
Um, can I have --

03:32.037 --> 03:33.517
Excuse me!

03:33.561 --> 03:36.346
Can I have your attention,
please?

03:36.390 --> 03:38.522
Great.

03:38.566 --> 03:42.309
First off, we expect to have you
back in your homes shortly.

03:42.352 --> 03:44.615
Uh, EPA techs
will be here tomorrow

03:44.659 --> 03:47.966
to determine the source of
the elevated benzine levels

03:48.010 --> 03:50.926
and how to properly respond.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.058
In the meantime, it is essential

03:53.102 --> 03:57.628
you stay out of the quarantine
zone until it's safe.

03:59.064 --> 04:00.849
Thanks.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.720
Okay.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.026
Any questions?

04:18.823 --> 04:19.911
Too much EMF.

04:19.955 --> 04:21.130
You can still
see 'em, right?

04:21.173 --> 04:22.392
Yeah, there were
some over there,

04:22.436 --> 04:25.090
but they spotted us
and left.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.396
Not their favorite.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.485
So you were a dick
to 'em in Hell, huh?

04:28.529 --> 04:29.660
No.

04:29.704 --> 04:31.314
I did my job.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.751
It's Hell.
It's not a day spa.

04:33.795 --> 04:37.277
Can't believe I've teamed up
with a demon again.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.756
Think I'd know
better by now.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.192
Teaming up with a Hunter.

04:40.236 --> 04:42.325
I could say the same.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.631
Why are you helping?

04:43.674 --> 04:46.808
I told you, I like Hell
the way it was.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.724
I'm a good soldier.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.641
Escape attempt, 11:00.

04:58.167 --> 05:01.126
Yeah.
Eh, nice shot.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.302
Well, he hit the warding.

05:02.345 --> 05:03.520
At least that's
still holding.

05:03.564 --> 05:04.913
Mm. For now.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.654
I mean, the spell is --
it's not gonna last forever,

05:06.697 --> 05:10.353
and these aren't your normal
ghosty-ghosts, you know.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.964
They're more dangerous.

05:13.008 --> 05:14.531
Dangerous how?

05:14.575 --> 05:18.796
Well, I mean, that guy you just
shot, it's Francis Tumblety.

05:18.840 --> 05:19.928
Who?

05:19.971 --> 05:21.973
Uh, "Jack the Ripper."

05:25.107 --> 05:26.151
Cool.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.376
I did ask 'em again, Andy,

05:33.420 --> 05:36.379
and it is
the same old runaround.

05:36.423 --> 05:39.817
"Doing everything
they can."

05:39.861 --> 05:40.992
Right.

05:41.036 --> 05:42.733
I just...

05:42.777 --> 05:44.996
What can we do?

05:45.040 --> 05:46.346
I don't know.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.481
There's somethin' goin' on
in this town, okay?

05:51.525 --> 05:54.658
And it ain't
the "benzine."

05:54.702 --> 05:56.312
Nan went out.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.445
She never came back.

06:00.098 --> 06:03.058
We're gonna get in there,
and we're gonna find her.

06:03.101 --> 06:07.584
They got guys patrolling
the town -- guys with guns.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.804
There's not enough of 'em.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.762
The area's too big.

06:11.806 --> 06:15.200
Hey, we'll find a way.

06:28.257 --> 06:29.258
Francis: Order.

06:29.301 --> 06:31.173
I will have order.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.049
Shut. Up!

06:38.093 --> 06:39.703
Oh.

06:39.747 --> 06:43.315
I-I know you're all wondering
why we were spit out of Hell

06:43.359 --> 06:45.448
and what's going on.

06:45.492 --> 06:48.538
Well, I have answers.

06:48.582 --> 06:51.846
It appears we were liberated
by cataclysm

06:51.889 --> 06:53.195
at the hands of...

06:53.238 --> 06:54.283
Ready?

06:55.545 --> 06:58.113
...God, Himself. Yes.

06:58.156 --> 07:03.292
I overheard it from the louts
who hold us captive -- Hunters.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.294
How do you know
they're Hunters?

07:05.337 --> 07:07.427
I was just shot with rock salt.

07:07.470 --> 07:08.950
Wild guess.

07:08.993 --> 07:12.736
Further, the Hunters are being
abetted by demons.

07:12.780 --> 07:17.741
I personally had an encounter
with none other than Belphegor.

07:17.785 --> 07:20.875
What do you suggest...
"Doctor?"

07:20.918 --> 07:24.618
Reach out to all the cowards
who are hiding in the shadows

07:24.661 --> 07:27.316
and tell them
to stand with us.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.840
Our strength is in numbers.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.887
We will find
a way out of here.

07:32.930 --> 07:35.019
But the warding...

07:35.063 --> 07:37.108
Warding is a door.

07:37.152 --> 07:38.458
Doors have locks.

07:38.501 --> 07:42.374
Locks have keys,
or they can be forced.

07:42.418 --> 07:45.203
But until we find a way,

07:45.247 --> 07:50.121
we make it as ugly as possible
for those who stand guard.

07:53.690 --> 07:56.606
Yeah, I just want to make sure
we're clear over there.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.145
Man: Another!

08:14.189 --> 08:16.713
Got it!

08:28.464 --> 08:31.554
I just think we need to
tell the family something.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.425
I mean, we found
his wife's body.

08:33.469 --> 08:35.166
Cass, we will.

08:35.210 --> 08:36.951
When we can.
When we can?

08:36.994 --> 08:38.648
Cass, we have people
outside that door

08:38.692 --> 08:40.520
who are barely
keeping it together.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.173
We start talking murder --

08:42.217 --> 08:43.305
Rowena: Knock knock!

08:43.348 --> 08:46.526
Am I interrupting
something juicy?

08:47.788 --> 08:49.833
No.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.269
Rowena,
thanks for coming.

08:51.313 --> 08:54.185
Samuel. Castiel.

08:54.229 --> 08:56.753
What?
A town full of ghosts!

08:56.797 --> 08:59.060
Messy even by Winchester
standards.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.278
We're hoping you can help.

09:00.322 --> 09:02.454
Can you boys do
nothing on your own?

09:02.498 --> 09:03.847
Very well.

09:03.891 --> 09:05.196
What do you want?

09:05.240 --> 09:06.546
Remember a couple years ago

09:06.589 --> 09:07.938
when we were trying
to get rid of Amara?

09:07.982 --> 09:09.331
God's sister, aye.

09:09.374 --> 09:10.854
Sticky business, that.Hmm.

09:10.898 --> 09:13.553
You made a crystalline device --
a bomb.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.076
You want to blow up
the ghosts?

09:15.119 --> 09:16.294
No. No. No, no.

09:16.338 --> 09:19.254
But the "bomb" was
powered by souls.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.603
Souls that were
sucked into it.

09:20.647 --> 09:23.563
Ah...and ghosts are
nothing but souls.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.129
I hope you're
not thinking --

09:25.173 --> 09:26.783
Trap them
in a crystal --

09:26.827 --> 09:29.220
Samuel, no!
That was so difficult.

09:29.264 --> 09:30.700
It took everything I had.

09:30.744 --> 09:33.355
-Yeah. Rowena...
-Sam.

09:33.398 --> 09:34.922
We got a situation.

09:41.102 --> 09:43.191
Hey, what's going on?

09:43.234 --> 09:44.540
Guy's wife disappeared.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.238
I guess he came back in here
looking for her.

09:47.282 --> 09:50.067
Alright.
Hey, uh, guys.

09:50.111 --> 09:51.895
What's happening?

09:51.939 --> 09:53.636
Uh, we're gonna have to ask you
to leave this area

09:53.680 --> 09:55.159
and head back to the school.

10:00.121 --> 10:02.340
Sam, they're possessed.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.392
Clear the way.

10:10.435 --> 10:12.263
We're leaving.

10:12.307 --> 10:14.614
Open the warding. Now.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.528
Obviously that's
not gonna happen.

10:16.572 --> 10:18.574
We're not in the mood
to argue.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.751
His insides are
being torn apart

10:21.795 --> 10:23.710
by the spirit
possessing him.

10:23.753 --> 10:26.495
So sad.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.149
That's far enough.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.280
Stop.

10:29.324 --> 10:31.239
The warding.

10:31.282 --> 10:32.632
Now!

10:48.604 --> 10:49.997
Hello, lads.

10:58.919 --> 11:01.573
Okay.
Ketch, how are you here?

11:01.617 --> 11:03.837
Oh, I-I just happened
to be in the area

11:03.880 --> 11:05.142
when you sent out word
looking for help

11:05.186 --> 11:07.492
with your little...
situation.

11:07.536 --> 11:08.798
Oh.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.495
Eh?

11:10.539 --> 11:13.281
Dean: Right, well.
That's -- Lucky us.

11:13.324 --> 11:15.805
What is that?

11:15.849 --> 11:18.678
Uh, it fires iron flakes,
expelling ghosts

11:18.721 --> 11:20.941
without harm to
the possessed victim,

11:20.984 --> 11:23.117
courtesy of
the British Men of Letters.

11:23.160 --> 11:26.511
I lifted it along with a few
other...toys when I left.

11:26.555 --> 11:29.253
Dear? I'd prefer
a wee shots of Scotch --

11:29.297 --> 11:31.473
18-year-old single malt,
if you have it handy.

11:31.516 --> 11:34.084
Ah, a witch with
fine taste.

11:34.128 --> 11:37.609
Rowena, I do hope
there's no hard feelings

11:37.653 --> 11:39.699
still after our initial
introduction.

11:39.742 --> 11:42.179
My people were holding
you prisoner and...

11:42.223 --> 11:46.314
But you let me escape,
and I haven't forgotten.

11:46.357 --> 11:48.098
Hmm.

11:53.408 --> 11:56.977
Rowena's working on a little
gadget that vacuums up souls.

11:57.020 --> 11:59.501
Oh.

11:59.544 --> 12:00.850
Fascinating.

12:00.894 --> 12:03.026
It's what I do.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.595
Yeah, problem is --
ghosts keep coming

12:06.638 --> 12:08.771
and the warding we put up
is only gonna last so long,

12:08.815 --> 12:11.295
so...all hands on deck.

12:11.339 --> 12:13.384
Right.

12:13.428 --> 12:14.777
Belphegor:
Streets are quiet.

12:14.821 --> 12:18.912
Which just means they're
planning their next move.

12:18.955 --> 12:21.653
Jack?Um, no.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.568
I get that a lot.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.396
So, Jack is...

12:25.440 --> 12:27.181
Dead.

12:27.224 --> 12:29.183
Jack is dead.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.445
Killed by God.

12:32.229 --> 12:33.883
I guess kid
got under His skin.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.798
And now I'm under Jack's.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.236
Yeah, literally.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.064
Belphegor's the name.

12:41.108 --> 12:43.197
You're Belphegor?

12:43.240 --> 12:45.155
And you're assisting
Sam and Dean

12:45.199 --> 12:46.983
with this whole
ghost business?

12:47.984 --> 12:49.681
This is awkward.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.727
What?

12:51.771 --> 12:54.599
Well, truth be told,
in my current employment

12:54.643 --> 12:57.124
as a freelance contractor,
I was asked to, um,

12:57.167 --> 13:00.301
assassinate
the demon Belphegor.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.433
You're not here
to help?
Well,
I certainly am now.

13:02.477 --> 13:05.436
I was told that Belphegor was
a monstrous threat to humanity.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.874
Apparently not correct,
yes, hmm?

13:07.917 --> 13:09.092
Who told you that?

13:09.136 --> 13:11.791
An attractive
female demon named --

13:11.834 --> 13:13.140
Ardat.

13:14.706 --> 13:17.318
She doesn't like you.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.800
Point is -- Don't kill him,
alright?

13:20.843 --> 13:21.844
We need him.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.063
For now.

13:29.983 --> 13:31.811
Hmm.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.335
Nice touch, Kimiko.

13:36.293 --> 13:38.774
Feel free to go deeper.

13:45.999 --> 13:49.611
Oh, oh, maybe not that deep.

13:49.654 --> 13:50.960
Whoa!

13:51.004 --> 13:52.614
You!

13:52.657 --> 13:53.876
Hi, sis.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.270
Did you smite
my masseuse?

13:58.011 --> 13:59.229
Oh, my --

13:59.273 --> 14:01.014
We agreed to give
each other space.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.754
I know.
I'm totally on board with that.

14:02.798 --> 14:03.973
Truly, I am.

14:04.017 --> 14:05.888
I just felt like, you know,
checking in.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.150
We are family.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.848
You're the darkness.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.154
I'm the light.

14:11.198 --> 14:14.375
So, how about the
"Game of Thrones" ending?

14:14.418 --> 14:16.638
Pretty great, right?

14:16.681 --> 14:18.596
Small talk? Really?

14:20.729 --> 14:22.296
Why are you here?

14:28.824 --> 14:30.260
First Nan went missing.

14:30.304 --> 14:31.653
Now Dave and Sheri.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.350
We are looking
for them everywhere.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.787
You said
you'd keep us safe.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.882
This is quite the list
of ingredients.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.187
Hope you got
an Amazon account.

14:44.231 --> 14:45.667
Prime.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.930
The trap requires
a tricky bit of spellery.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.192
I need what I need.

14:49.236 --> 14:50.890
Even then, no guarantee.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.630
Well, you're
the mad scientist.

14:52.674 --> 14:57.200
So, uh, tell me
about Arthur Ketch.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.898
Seems like you've met.

14:58.941 --> 15:02.118
That was more of a
torturer-torturee relationship.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.599
Fun, but I didn't really
get to know him.

15:04.642 --> 15:08.385
Rowena, we have ourselves
a crisis on our hands, okay?

15:08.429 --> 15:09.734
Find yourself
another boy toy.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.911
You don't want to get
involved with Ketch.

15:13.608 --> 15:14.826
Don't I?

15:22.617 --> 15:23.748
Hey.

15:23.792 --> 15:24.924
Yeah, hey.

15:26.882 --> 15:30.581
Dean, I recognize that
I...dropped the puck.

15:30.625 --> 15:31.713
Ball.

15:31.756 --> 15:34.890
It's, uh -- It's
"dropped the ball."

15:34.934 --> 15:38.024
Ball, right.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.722
I didn't tell you
about Jack,

15:40.765 --> 15:43.159
and then after what happened
with your mother...

15:46.293 --> 15:47.816
Don't.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.081
You're angry.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.387
Yes, I am angry.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.476
At everything. All of it.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.045
All of it?

15:59.088 --> 16:01.917
This mess --
all the messes.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.527
It turns out that
we're just hamsters

16:03.571 --> 16:05.094
running in a wheel
our whole lives.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.531
What do we have to
show for it, huh?

16:07.575 --> 16:10.099
Tell me you don't
feel conned.

16:10.143 --> 16:13.320
God's been lying to you,
Cass, forever.

16:13.363 --> 16:15.322
You bought into
the biggest scam in history.

16:15.365 --> 16:16.845
You don't think I'm angry?

16:16.888 --> 16:18.978
After what Chuck did?
After what he took from me?

16:19.021 --> 16:20.980
He killed Jack.

16:21.023 --> 16:24.287
But that doesn't mean
it was all a lie.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.376
Really?

16:26.420 --> 16:27.987
Chuck is all-knowing.

16:28.030 --> 16:30.598
He knew the truth, he --
he just kept it to himself.

16:30.641 --> 16:32.948
Well, now that
his cover's blown,

16:32.992 --> 16:35.603
everything that we've
done is for what?

16:35.646 --> 16:36.473
Nothing?

16:36.517 --> 16:38.301
Even if we didn't know

16:38.345 --> 16:40.390
that all of the challenges
that we face

16:40.434 --> 16:43.393
were born
of Chuck's machinations,

16:43.437 --> 16:45.874
how would we describe
it all?

16:45.917 --> 16:48.181
We'd call it "life."

16:48.224 --> 16:51.097
Because that's precisely
what life is.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.489
It's an obstacle course,

16:52.533 --> 16:54.448
and maybe Chuck
designed the obstacles,

16:54.491 --> 16:56.145
but we ran our own race.

16:56.189 --> 16:57.842
We made our own moves.

16:57.886 --> 17:01.716
And mostly,
we did well with that.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.326
Did we?

17:04.371 --> 17:06.286
I'll tell you
what we do know.

17:06.329 --> 17:10.594
Nothing about
our lives is real.

17:10.638 --> 17:11.856
Everything that we've lost,

17:11.900 --> 17:15.338
everything that we are
is because of Chuck.

17:15.382 --> 17:18.646
So maybe you can stick
your head back in the sand,

17:18.689 --> 17:23.955
maybe you can pretend that
we actually had a choice.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.479
I can't.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.440
Dean.

17:30.484 --> 17:34.270
You asked, "What about
all of this is real?"

17:38.361 --> 17:39.928
We are.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.553
Oh, here.
Almost forgot.

17:56.597 --> 17:59.382
You're gonna
wanna wear this.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.645
Um...not really...me.

18:01.689 --> 18:03.212
Neither is possession.

18:03.256 --> 18:04.822
It's iron.
Put it on.

18:04.866 --> 18:05.954
Mm-hmm.

18:09.262 --> 18:11.220
So, based on what
you're telling me,

18:11.264 --> 18:14.397
the enemy is
actually...God?

18:14.441 --> 18:16.095
Yeah, go figure.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.662
You guys didn't come up with
a cool weapon for Him, did you?

18:18.706 --> 18:19.750
No.

18:19.794 --> 18:22.579
God was always
more...theoretical --

18:22.623 --> 18:24.929
more rumor than fact.

18:24.973 --> 18:27.932
Hmm.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.760
So, um...

18:31.284 --> 18:32.676
Tell me about the witch.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.243
Aw, come on.
What is it with you two?

18:34.287 --> 18:35.331
What?

18:41.468 --> 18:42.860
Trouble.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.819
Two Hunters
haven't checked in.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.816
That's not good.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.166
Ben?

19:27.209 --> 19:28.384
Frankie?

19:53.496 --> 19:55.977
Stop it!

19:56.020 --> 19:58.240
Stop! Get out.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.459
Now!

20:14.387 --> 20:15.997
Kevin?

20:21.089 --> 20:22.743
I don't believe it.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.484
Yeah, I was gonna meet up
with you guys sooner,

20:24.527 --> 20:27.443
but I...kinda
just got here.

20:27.487 --> 20:28.705
Kevin Tran.

20:28.749 --> 20:30.185
Former prophet...

20:30.229 --> 20:31.752
Arthur Ketch, uh...

20:31.795 --> 20:34.537
former assassin.

20:34.581 --> 20:35.930
Mostly.

20:35.973 --> 20:37.845
What are you -- What are you
even doin' here?

20:37.888 --> 20:39.238
You're supposed
to be in Heaven.

20:39.281 --> 20:40.500
Yeah, not so much.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.197
Chuck said he was
sending you to Heaven.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.373
Yeah, what he said,
not what he did.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.419
Wait, he lied?

20:46.462 --> 20:48.377
For what? Kicks?

20:48.421 --> 20:50.466
Turns out, God's a dick.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.902
Look, it doesn't matter.

20:51.946 --> 20:54.949
We are going to
get you to Heaven, okay?

20:54.992 --> 20:59.562
Right after we shove
all these ghosts back down.

20:59.606 --> 21:03.044
At least the town
is warded.

21:03.087 --> 21:05.699
Yeah, but it's fading.

21:05.742 --> 21:07.135
I can feel it.

21:07.178 --> 21:10.269
So, the others feel it,
as well?

21:10.312 --> 21:11.574
Uh, not sure.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.794
But if they do,
you've got a lot of problems.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.622
What, your -- your --
your pals know

21:15.665 --> 21:17.711
that you, me, and Sam
have history?

21:17.754 --> 21:19.887
I mean, you did just yell at 'em
and saved my ass.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.367
I yell at 'em all the time.

21:21.410 --> 21:22.585
They take it.

21:22.629 --> 21:24.370
Since God himself
cast me down,

21:24.413 --> 21:26.502
I've got kind of
a bad-boy rep.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.199
Oh.

21:28.243 --> 21:31.028
That means you can mingle.

21:31.072 --> 21:33.379
It's way older than five...

21:33.422 --> 21:35.729
Vegetables and herbs
are finely chopped,

21:35.772 --> 21:37.948
added to a sexy pastiche
of fragrant tripe.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.994
Passing now is Kirk. Now it--

21:41.691 --> 21:43.302
I called room service
like an hour ago.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.955
How long's a burger take?

21:48.655 --> 21:49.873
You know...

21:49.917 --> 21:52.789
That, uh...little retreat
of ours,

21:52.833 --> 21:56.315
it taught me how priceless
our relationship is.

21:58.142 --> 22:00.797
And, you know, since
I'm on an extended break

22:00.841 --> 22:03.452
from my omniscient
benevolence,

22:03.496 --> 22:07.282
why not use the time
to deepen what we have?

22:07.326 --> 22:10.111
So, you know, why not drop by
another dimension?

22:10.154 --> 22:11.373
Check it out.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.114
Maybe start a new species?

22:13.157 --> 22:13.941
Huh?

22:13.984 --> 22:15.638
You know? A family project.

22:15.682 --> 22:18.249
Sound good?

22:18.293 --> 22:22.166
I'm...fine.

22:22.210 --> 22:25.561
I am running a hot streak
in craps.

22:25.605 --> 22:27.607
I like Reno.

22:27.650 --> 22:32.002
Everyone here
is so not...you.

22:38.922 --> 22:40.402
What?

22:40.446 --> 22:41.925
Do I have a booger?

22:44.450 --> 22:47.409
Interesting.

22:47.453 --> 22:50.499
What...is it?

22:50.543 --> 22:52.283
I don't know.

22:55.765 --> 22:57.419
You need me.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.682
Of course I need you,
Amara.

22:59.726 --> 23:01.684
You're my big sis.

23:01.728 --> 23:05.296
You've never needed me.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.821
What...is going on?

23:11.302 --> 23:13.392
Oh.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.876
Oh, there it is...

23:19.920 --> 23:21.095
Hm.

23:22.531 --> 23:24.141
Your shoulder.Ow!

23:28.232 --> 23:29.886
Something happened.

23:29.930 --> 23:31.975
You're not complete.

23:32.019 --> 23:35.936
You're not
at full strength.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.026
And you're afraid.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.336
Okay, look, it's great
to have Kevin around --

23:45.380 --> 23:46.773
even Ghost Kevin --

23:46.816 --> 23:48.949
but do you think it's safe
having him do what he's doing?

23:48.992 --> 23:50.864
No. No.
I mean, none of this is safe

23:50.907 --> 23:53.344
for any of us, but if he can
give us some information,

23:53.388 --> 23:55.651
you know...

23:57.914 --> 24:00.177
Would you stop
sneaking up on us?

24:00.221 --> 24:01.875
Hey, we just heard
from a reliable source

24:01.918 --> 24:03.093
that the warding
is fading.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.617
Yeah. Sure, sure.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.009
Like -- Like I said it would.

24:06.053 --> 24:07.924
I guess I just assumed
you two pros

24:07.968 --> 24:10.274
woulda wrapped it up by now.

24:11.754 --> 24:13.539
What can I say?
Goofy optimist.

24:13.582 --> 24:15.932
Okay, meanwhile, we're gonna
need you to charge her back up.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.543
Oh...

24:17.586 --> 24:19.022
Yeah, if only.

24:19.066 --> 24:20.937
Sorry, guys.
It was a one-time thing.

24:23.070 --> 24:25.768
Well, Kevin says the ghosts
may sense its weakness.

24:25.812 --> 24:27.378
Oh, "Kevin says"?

24:27.422 --> 24:28.467
Kevin Tran?

24:28.510 --> 24:29.772
Whiny Kevin Tran?

24:29.816 --> 24:31.078
Ugh. Typical millennial.

24:31.121 --> 24:32.775
Kevin's not even
supposed to be in Hell,

24:32.819 --> 24:34.168
okay, so when
this is all over,

24:34.211 --> 24:36.126
we're gonna send him up
in Heaven where he belongs.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.955
Yeah, yeah, not gonna happen.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.653
Souls cast down to Hell?

24:40.696 --> 24:41.784
That's the end of it.

24:41.828 --> 24:42.785
Heaven can't take 'em.

24:42.829 --> 24:44.308
That's not true.

24:44.352 --> 24:45.962
Our dad made it to Heaven
after he was in Hell.

24:46.006 --> 24:47.050
And Bobby Singer.

24:47.094 --> 24:48.138
So God made an exception.

24:48.182 --> 24:50.576
Didn't he used
to like you two?

24:50.619 --> 24:52.099
Just saying.

24:52.142 --> 24:55.668
Without the big guy...
them's the rules.

25:19.474 --> 25:21.432
Still
with the shoulder?

25:21.476 --> 25:23.391
I'm okay.

25:23.434 --> 25:24.566
It's getting better.

25:29.702 --> 25:31.834
I felt it.

25:31.878 --> 25:34.837
Yes, yes, I felt it, too.

25:34.881 --> 25:39.668
The warding that surrounds us
is indeed beginning to falter.

25:39.712 --> 25:43.542
So, we just hang loose for
a while, then when it fails,

25:43.585 --> 25:44.717
we just stroll outta here.

25:44.760 --> 25:48.198
No, I say
we seize the moment.

25:48.242 --> 25:50.200
Use our collective strength.

25:50.244 --> 25:53.377
We find the most vulnerable
point in the warding,

25:53.421 --> 25:56.685
mass our power,
and break through now.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.034
Then back to all the fun

25:58.078 --> 26:00.123
that sent us to Hell
in the first place.

26:00.167 --> 26:03.213
We can't be the only ones
noticing the wall's got issues.

26:03.257 --> 26:06.869
The Hunters will be workin'
overtime to send us back.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.573
What have we here?

26:16.270 --> 26:19.969
Well, look who Hell
just coughed up.

26:20.013 --> 26:21.667
Kevin Tran.

26:21.710 --> 26:24.626
Yeah, so what?

26:24.670 --> 26:26.367
Answer the lady.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.108
What do we do
about the Hunters?

26:28.151 --> 26:29.718
Well, you tell me, Kevin.

26:29.762 --> 26:32.155
Aren't you privy
to their plans?

26:32.199 --> 26:35.550
Who, me?

26:35.594 --> 26:36.986
Are you kidding?

26:38.466 --> 26:41.382
In Hell, I was never
as impressed by you

26:41.425 --> 26:44.080
as my more gullible
colleagues.

26:44.124 --> 26:46.605
I've heard demons
say that in life,

26:46.648 --> 26:50.260
you were quite closely
connected to the Hunters.

26:50.304 --> 26:52.915
To the Winchesters,
in particular.

26:52.959 --> 26:56.310
Oh, you know how
the Hellspawn are.

26:56.353 --> 27:01.271
All they talk about is
Sam and Dean, Sam and Dean...

27:01.315 --> 27:03.012
Okay.

27:03.056 --> 27:04.753
I've had enough of this.

27:07.538 --> 27:09.628
Mnh.

27:11.151 --> 27:14.284
Rowena: I do like
a left-brained man.

27:14.328 --> 27:19.376
Logic, cause and effect,
calculations -- very butch.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.422
It does, however,

27:21.465 --> 27:25.426
lack the more nuanced
perspective of...

27:25.469 --> 27:27.994
the right brain.

27:28.037 --> 27:32.912
The, um...voodoo,
booga-booga perspective.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.828
One might welcome
the coupling of both.

27:35.871 --> 27:37.220
Ah.

27:37.264 --> 27:41.137
The dominating,
analytical enforcer -- you --

27:41.181 --> 27:45.533
and the pulsating,
throbbing firebrand -- me.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.232
Hmm.

27:51.321 --> 27:56.631
Well, in the, um...
spirit of...coupling...

27:57.763 --> 28:00.679
...may I suggest a shortcut
to your alchemy,

28:00.722 --> 28:05.422
one we used at the, um,
British Men of Letters?

28:05.466 --> 28:07.555
Mm.

28:07.598 --> 28:09.862
Right. Mm.

28:21.308 --> 28:22.613
Mm.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.231
Oh!

28:37.106 --> 28:39.152
I think you'll find

28:39.195 --> 28:42.851
you can skip
the next two steps.

28:42.895 --> 28:46.942
The power of science.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.727
But...

28:48.770 --> 28:51.077
if we were to marry

28:51.120 --> 28:55.429
the power of science
with the power of magic,

28:55.472 --> 28:58.301
you might find
we had a situation

28:58.345 --> 29:02.871
that was highly explosive.

29:11.619 --> 29:15.362
Yes, Dean, what?

29:15.405 --> 29:18.887
Aye, it's almost there.

29:18.931 --> 29:21.977
But you can't rush
these things.

29:22.021 --> 29:24.066
Fine, fine.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.813
Right.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.394
Rowena.

29:47.437 --> 29:49.831
Delicious to see
you again.

29:49.875 --> 29:53.095
Francis Tumblety!

29:53.139 --> 29:54.836
You're an unfaithful dog.

29:54.880 --> 29:55.837
Oh?

29:55.881 --> 29:58.535
And you're Mary Poppins?

29:58.579 --> 30:00.973
You know I always thought
of you as special.

30:01.016 --> 30:02.844
I gutted my other dates.

30:02.888 --> 30:05.804
I told you centuries back,
our liaison was finito,

30:05.847 --> 30:07.109
so let me pass.

30:07.153 --> 30:09.416
What's in the bag, Red?

30:12.898 --> 30:14.290
Oh, don't tell me.

30:14.334 --> 30:17.467
You're working with
the Hunters now?

30:17.511 --> 30:19.426
How sad.

30:21.384 --> 30:23.865
But perhaps there's
a silver lining.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.475
You can deliver a message.

30:25.519 --> 30:31.481
Tell the Winchesters we have
their boy, and we want to talk.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.832
5879 Maple.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.572
We'll be waiting.

30:35.616 --> 30:37.879
You there!
Charm School.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.141
Run.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.991
I got here as quick
as I could.

31:03.035 --> 31:04.688
Mr. Ketch and I were
attacked by ghosts.

31:04.732 --> 31:06.952
He may still be
fightin' them.
Are you okay?

31:06.995 --> 31:09.824
He --
Francis said they have your boy.

31:09.868 --> 31:10.825
Kevin?

31:12.218 --> 31:13.610
Did you bring
the soul catcher?

31:13.654 --> 31:15.134
Is that what
you're calling it?

31:15.177 --> 31:17.353
I like soul catcher.Whatever.

31:17.397 --> 31:20.008
There's been such a fuss,
there's no telling if it works.

31:20.052 --> 31:22.184
Well, if it doesn't,
nice knowin' all of you.

31:35.545 --> 31:37.939
The Messrs. Winchester.

31:37.983 --> 31:41.769
I hope this encounter's more
productive than the last one.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.031
You said you wanna talk.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.293
Indeed.

31:44.337 --> 31:46.339
The terms are quite simple.

31:46.382 --> 31:48.167
You shut down the warding.

31:48.210 --> 31:50.909
I won't devour Kevin whole.

31:50.952 --> 31:53.346
Well, here's our offer.
You go to Hell.

31:53.389 --> 31:55.957
Not what
it's cracked up to be.

32:01.658 --> 32:04.270
Well, boys,
what's it gonna be?

32:12.104 --> 32:13.235
Capare!

32:24.638 --> 32:26.248
Thanks.

32:27.554 --> 32:30.949
I think my badass days in Hell
may be over.

32:30.992 --> 32:32.863
Yeah, looks like.

32:32.907 --> 32:34.474
Nice work, Rowena.

32:34.517 --> 32:37.259
Oh, it's not as powerful
as the first one.

32:37.303 --> 32:39.000
A few ghosts at a time,
I'm afraid.

32:39.044 --> 32:40.262
A lot of them got away.

32:40.306 --> 32:41.437
So what now?

32:41.481 --> 32:42.917
They have a backup plan --

32:42.961 --> 32:46.051
They know that the warding's
been fading.

32:46.094 --> 32:48.923
They think if they mass all
the ghosts at its weakest point,

32:48.967 --> 32:50.272
they'll be able to bust out.

32:50.316 --> 32:52.274
Well, where's its
weakest point?

33:00.326 --> 33:02.850
So...not good.

33:02.893 --> 33:05.113
You can see 'em.
How many of 'em are there?

33:05.157 --> 33:08.290
100 at least.
More keep coming.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.820
Easy.

33:16.864 --> 33:18.213
It's just me.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.400
Yeah, that's
not gonna work.

33:31.444 --> 33:33.576
There -- There's
too many of them.

33:38.407 --> 33:40.061
How 'bout it?

33:47.199 --> 33:49.027
Capare!

33:53.118 --> 33:54.684
It's working.

33:59.211 --> 34:01.691
Capare!

34:03.084 --> 34:04.781
Ketch?

34:14.835 --> 34:16.967
Son of a bitch.

34:22.930 --> 34:24.366
Oh, Dean.

34:24.410 --> 34:26.020
Did you run out?

34:29.110 --> 34:30.372
Wouldn't matter anyway.

34:30.416 --> 34:32.070
And thank you.

34:32.113 --> 34:34.202
Thank you so very much.

34:34.246 --> 34:35.856
Francis...

34:35.899 --> 34:40.295
The thing about souls
is...they're almost pure power,

34:40.339 --> 34:44.560
so even with the few trapped
inside your little gizmo here,

34:44.604 --> 34:48.782
I am in possession of
a massively powerful weapon,

34:48.825 --> 34:53.569
one which I will happily use
to blow open that warding.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.624
Capare!

35:09.194 --> 35:10.804
Capare!

35:31.999 --> 35:33.566
I tried to heal him,
but it didn't work.

35:33.609 --> 35:34.784
I don't know why.

35:34.828 --> 35:36.786
You're probably
just tired, Cass.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.527
We all are.

35:40.486 --> 35:42.575
They're gonna
get you fixed up.

35:42.618 --> 35:45.360
Sorry about the whole
iron bullets.

35:45.404 --> 35:47.275
There just didn't
seem to be another way.

35:47.319 --> 35:49.016
Oh, admit it.

35:49.059 --> 35:50.278
You've killed me once.

35:50.322 --> 35:52.280
You've been itching
to do it again.

35:52.324 --> 35:53.847
Well, there's that.

35:56.110 --> 35:58.112
Take care, man.

36:32.842 --> 36:34.583
Hey.

36:34.627 --> 36:36.846
Kevin said
he wants to leave.

36:36.890 --> 36:37.978
"Leave"?

36:38.021 --> 36:39.022
No. No, no, no.

36:39.066 --> 36:40.807
We -- We gotta get
you into Heaven.

36:40.850 --> 36:43.679
How?

36:43.723 --> 36:45.986
Belphegor says...

36:46.029 --> 36:48.336
I've been in Hell.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.686
Heaven can't let me in.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.037
Kevin, being a ghost

36:54.081 --> 36:58.346
with nothing to hold you...
anywhere...

37:00.000 --> 37:03.221
...that would be
a terrible way to exist.

37:03.264 --> 37:04.657
That's true.

37:04.700 --> 37:08.878
Look, I got two options --
Hell or Earth.

37:08.922 --> 37:10.924
In one, I get tortured
for eternity.

37:10.967 --> 37:12.926
In the other,
I might go crazy.

37:12.969 --> 37:15.276
Guess I'll take
door number two.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.235
I won't go back to Hell.

37:20.890 --> 37:23.806
Maybe...

37:23.850 --> 37:28.376
I know Belphegor can't
power up the warding...

37:28.420 --> 37:34.164
but maybe he can make
just a bit of it dip?

37:34.208 --> 37:35.253
You know, for a minute.

37:35.296 --> 37:37.559
E-Enough to let me out.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.133
I'm sorry, Kevin.

37:46.176 --> 37:48.353
I wish there was some way
to make this right.

37:48.396 --> 37:51.094
Me, too, but there isn't.

37:51.138 --> 37:55.751
And sometimes, you just
gotta accept that.

37:55.795 --> 37:59.059
Besides, I'm better off
than I was and...

38:00.321 --> 38:01.844
I mean, there's a whole world
out there.

38:01.888 --> 38:03.977
Would you come on,
already?

38:10.113 --> 38:13.073
Take care, Kev.

38:13.116 --> 38:14.944
I love you guys.

39:08.694 --> 39:10.826
Going somewhere?

39:10.870 --> 39:12.480
Yes.

39:12.524 --> 39:13.699
Great.

39:13.742 --> 39:15.309
Where we headed?

39:15.353 --> 39:17.485
Alone.
I'm going alone.

39:17.529 --> 39:19.400
Amara, we've been
all through this.

39:19.444 --> 39:21.054
We belong together.
Yes.

39:21.097 --> 39:23.317
Yes, yin, yang,
balance of nature.

39:23.361 --> 39:27.365
I am willing to coexist with
you, brother, in the universe.

39:27.408 --> 39:30.455
Just not, you know,
anywhere near you.

39:30.498 --> 39:31.804
Hey, don't test me.

39:31.847 --> 39:34.067
I front the group.
You sing backup.

39:34.110 --> 39:35.764
Oh, really?

39:35.808 --> 39:37.853
Because you're "God"?

39:37.897 --> 39:40.160
Amara, just --
Don't.

39:43.250 --> 39:46.688
Even on your best day,
you couldn't force my hand.

39:46.732 --> 39:51.824
And this is not
your best day.

39:51.867 --> 39:56.394
In fact, I don't think you
can do much of anything.

39:58.787 --> 40:00.528
Ah, a few parlor tricks,
perhaps,

40:00.572 --> 40:04.532
but you can't leave this world,
not without my help.

40:04.576 --> 40:06.447
And me?

40:06.491 --> 40:09.537
I'm done, Chuck.

40:09.581 --> 40:11.496
I've changed.

40:11.539 --> 40:12.453
I've adapted.

40:12.497 --> 40:13.846
I've...

40:13.889 --> 40:16.152
I've become
the better me.

40:16.196 --> 40:17.589
And you?

40:17.632 --> 40:22.420
You are still the same --
petulant, narcissistic.

40:22.463 --> 40:25.466
So...I'm leaving you here.

40:31.037 --> 40:37.478
Once, long ago,
you sealed me away.

40:37.522 --> 40:42.135
Now, in a way...
I'm doing the same to you.

40:43.789 --> 40:49.316
You're trapped,
diminished, abandoned.

40:51.449 --> 40:55.496
So I guess you got what
you've always wanted.

40:55.540 --> 40:57.324
You're on your own.

41:11.947 --> 41:14.036
Dean: What's going on?

41:17.344 --> 41:19.912
They just keep coming.

41:19.955 --> 41:21.609
Soon, they're
gonna overrun us.

41:21.653 --> 41:22.915
Again.

41:22.958 --> 41:25.308
Once my spell comes
crashing down...

41:25.352 --> 41:27.789
My little toy isn't strong
enough to handle all this.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.748
We have to find
another way.

41:29.791 --> 41:32.794
Before it's too late.

41:32.838 --> 41:36.494
Alright, then that's
what we'll do.

41:36.537 --> 41:39.279
How?
