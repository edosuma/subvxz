WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:05.396
Whoo!

00:05.483 --> 00:06.397
Whoa.

00:07.529 --> 00:08.617
All right.

00:08.704 --> 00:10.184
Stretch it out.

00:10.271 --> 00:11.272
How was your run?

00:11.359 --> 00:13.143
I think it might have been

00:13.230 --> 00:14.536
my personal best.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.799
Two miles in...

00:16.886 --> 00:19.671
46 minutes.

00:19.758 --> 00:20.672
You'’re really
committed to this.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.152
Good for you.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.806
Yeah, well, you know
how they talk about

00:23.893 --> 00:25.808
that runner'’s high?

00:25.895 --> 00:28.028
Well, it'’s real.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.551
It'’s not great, but it'’s real.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.163
Nice.

00:33.250 --> 00:34.817
So, listen,

00:34.904 --> 00:36.036
I got a call...

00:36.123 --> 00:37.211
Uh-huh.

00:37.298 --> 00:38.429
About you.

00:38.516 --> 00:39.778
Okay.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.954
You do know
we'’re having a drought.

00:43.695 --> 00:45.828
Yeah, I'’ve chosen
not to participate.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.657
So you got a call?

00:48.744 --> 00:50.137
Right.

00:50.224 --> 00:53.096
It was a very surprising call.

00:53.183 --> 00:54.532
Why are you dragging this out?

00:54.619 --> 00:55.751
Because you'’re in a good mood

00:55.838 --> 00:58.014
and I'’m gonna miss that.

00:58.101 --> 00:59.537
Who called?

00:59.624 --> 01:00.886
It was a private investigator

01:00.973 --> 01:03.715
hired to track you down.

01:03.802 --> 01:05.978
All right, pack your bags.
We knew this day would come.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.068
No. No, no, no.

01:08.155 --> 01:11.288
He was hired by...

01:11.375 --> 01:12.855
your mother.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.378
What?

01:14.465 --> 01:15.988
She wants to meet you.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.557
Huh.

01:19.644 --> 01:20.428
You okay?

01:20.515 --> 01:22.517
Is that a good "huh"?

01:22.604 --> 01:24.040
A bad "huh"?

01:24.127 --> 01:25.737
A shoot the
messenger "huh"?

01:25.824 --> 01:28.523
How'’d this guy find me?

01:28.610 --> 01:29.872
Um, well,

01:29.959 --> 01:31.439
your recent DUI

01:31.526 --> 01:33.615
seems to be the gift
that keeps on giving.

01:35.312 --> 01:37.488
Anyway, your mom lives
in San Francisco,

01:37.575 --> 01:40.100
but she'’d be willing to drive
here if you want to meet her.

01:40.187 --> 01:43.190
Nice to know she gave up her kid
but kept the car.

01:45.366 --> 01:46.758
Okay, here'’s what
I want you to do.

01:46.845 --> 01:48.456
I want you to call
this detective

01:48.543 --> 01:49.935
and tell him he'’s got
the wrong Bonnie Plunkett.

01:50.022 --> 01:51.589
My mother died
stopping terrorists

01:51.676 --> 01:52.895
from blowing up Disneyland.

01:52.982 --> 01:54.331
What?

01:54.418 --> 01:56.028
That'’s what I decided
when I was nine,

01:56.116 --> 01:57.117
and I'’m sticking with it.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.120
Okay, I'’ll call him.

02:00.207 --> 02:02.252
Wait! Stop.

02:02.339 --> 02:04.428
Didn'’t move.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.126
What is going on here?

02:06.213 --> 02:07.779
Why am I getting
so upset about this?

02:07.866 --> 02:10.826
This is just a woman
I share DNA with.

02:10.913 --> 02:12.915
I don'’t know, maybe
I should meet her.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.482
Who knows?

02:14.569 --> 02:16.788
Maybe I'’ll need a kidney
or bone marrow someday.

02:16.875 --> 02:18.486
Liver, more likely.

02:18.573 --> 02:19.965
[scoffs]

02:20.052 --> 02:23.404
For God'’s sakes,
it'’s a historic drought!

02:23.491 --> 02:24.970
Nope, not gonna do it.

02:25.057 --> 02:26.581
If I need an organ,
I'’ll get it from you.

02:26.668 --> 02:27.973
[sighs]

02:28.060 --> 02:30.324
My liver might not be
an upgrade.

02:30.411 --> 02:34.023
That woman gave me up
when I was four years old.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.329
You know what happens
to four-year-olds

02:35.416 --> 02:36.678
who get tossed into the system?

02:36.765 --> 02:38.593
They don'’t get adopted,

02:38.680 --> 02:40.638
especially when they'’re
five feet tall!

02:40.725 --> 02:42.074
Okay, we'’re walking again.

02:44.555 --> 02:48.211
Hey, how '’bout
we go to a meeting?

02:48.298 --> 02:50.474
You go to a meeting.
I'’m going for a run.

02:50.561 --> 02:51.867
You just did that.

02:51.954 --> 02:53.956
Remember how I used to do blow?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.089
Now I run like that.

03:18.676 --> 03:21.244
So you'’re not the least bit
curious to meet her?

03:21.331 --> 03:22.593
She'’s not my mother.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.291
This woman is more my mother.

03:24.378 --> 03:26.075
She'’s fed me more times.

03:26.162 --> 03:29.209
Be nice if you said "please"
and "thank you" once in a while.

03:31.167 --> 03:34.170
In her defense, she did
give you life.
I disagree.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.128
How do you disagree
with that?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.174
I would'’ve gotten here
some other way.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.917
Don'’t you wonder what she wants?

03:42.004 --> 03:42.918
Who cares what she wants?

03:43.005 --> 03:44.311
First she wanted a little girl,

03:44.398 --> 03:45.573
then she didn'’t want
a little girl.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.444
Now she wants
a little girl again?

03:47.531 --> 03:48.837
Well, I'’m not gonna be her
little girl. Not gonna happen.

03:48.924 --> 03:51.970
[whispering]: She thinks
she'’s a little girl?

03:52.057 --> 03:53.972
Bonnie, I know you don'’t
want to hear this,

03:54.059 --> 03:55.539
but seeing her again
might be good for you.

03:55.626 --> 03:56.801
It might be healing.

03:56.888 --> 03:59.587
Oh, please.
Who am I if I heal?

04:01.241 --> 04:02.938
I want to meet her.

04:05.157 --> 04:06.463
You'’re kidding, right?

04:06.550 --> 04:08.160
She'’s my grandmother.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.162
I'’d like to know
where I come from.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.991
I can'’t believe you'’re not
on my side with this.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.776
I'’m not taking sides.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.343
We have no relatives.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.127
Roscoe had to make
a family tree

04:18.214 --> 04:19.214
for school last year.

04:19.302 --> 04:21.870
It had one leaf.

04:21.957 --> 04:25.308
Wouldn'’t it have four leaves
since he has a sibling and...

04:25.395 --> 04:26.614
Trying to make
a point, Wendy.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.747
Do what you want.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.882
You'’re welcome.

04:48.549 --> 04:49.680
Hi.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.987
I'’m Christy Plunkett.

04:52.074 --> 04:53.684
Hello, Christy.

04:53.771 --> 04:56.426
It is so nice
to meet you.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.994
Well, it'’s nice
to meet you, too.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.171
You are so pretty.

05:02.258 --> 05:04.956
Thank you.

05:05.043 --> 05:07.742
You smell like
gingerbread.

05:09.657 --> 05:12.050
That'’s always how
I imagined you'’d smell.

05:12.137 --> 05:15.184
You imagined smelling me?

05:15.271 --> 05:18.405
Mostly at Christmas.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.537
I think we have the
same nose. [chuckles]

05:20.624 --> 05:23.540
Okay, now,
this is getting weird.

05:23.627 --> 05:26.891
Wait, aren'’t you
Shirley Stabler?

05:26.978 --> 05:28.676
No, that'’s me.

05:30.242 --> 05:31.722
[sighs]

05:31.809 --> 05:33.028
I'’m sorry.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.986
I thought you were
my grandmother.

05:35.073 --> 05:36.553
Well, we'’re even.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.033
I thought you were nuts.

05:42.777 --> 05:43.691
Hi.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.170
Hi.

05:45.257 --> 05:46.694
Nice to meet you.

05:46.781 --> 05:49.087
It'’s nice to meet you, too.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.525
Ah. You smell
like cigarettes.

05:53.222 --> 05:56.704
Yep, you'’re my
grandmother.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.227
Look at you.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.968
You look...

06:00.055 --> 06:02.449
nothing like I pictured.

06:02.536 --> 06:06.061
That lady thought
I was pretty.

06:06.148 --> 06:07.758
Oh, you are.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.457
You'’re beautiful.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.459
No way that'’s
your natural hair color.

06:14.025 --> 06:16.288
But it looks good on you.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.422
I'’m sorry your daughter
couldn'’t be here.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.337
Oh, that'’s okay.

06:21.424 --> 06:23.905
I figured it was a 50/50 shot.

06:23.992 --> 06:26.777
It'’s cute you thought
it was that close.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.867
I'’m guessing she hates me.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.130
Yeah, but...

06:32.217 --> 06:34.263
she hates
so many people.

06:34.350 --> 06:35.612
She hates Elton John.

06:35.699 --> 06:36.918
I mean, who hates
Elton John?

06:37.005 --> 06:39.442
The guy'’s
a hit machine.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.923
Oh, so you'’re a babbler, huh?

06:42.010 --> 06:44.621
Only when I'’m
uncomfortable.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.971
Not that I'’m uncomfortable
now. I mean...

06:47.058 --> 06:49.626
Yeah. Yeah, I am
a babbler.

06:49.713 --> 06:53.587
Well, I'’m glad you came.

06:53.674 --> 06:56.111
You look like
you turned out fine.

06:56.198 --> 06:58.679
Actually,
the first 33 years

06:58.766 --> 07:01.638
were kind of
touch and go.

07:01.725 --> 07:05.468
I was an alcoholic
and a stripper

07:05.555 --> 07:06.861
and a bit of
a drug addict.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.428
WOMAN:
Oh, Christy.

07:13.215 --> 07:15.347
I-I turned it around.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.220
Hey, go find your own
granddaughter.

07:21.223 --> 07:23.965
Now I have
a great job,

07:24.052 --> 07:25.662
I'’ve gone
back to school,

07:25.749 --> 07:28.012
I have two
terrific kids.

07:28.099 --> 07:29.318
You got any pictures?

07:29.405 --> 07:31.015
Um...

07:31.102 --> 07:32.669
Okay.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.715
This is Roscoe.
Aw.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.543
He'’s ten.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.154
This was a rash

07:39.241 --> 07:41.461
I was concerned about,
but it'’s cleared up.

07:41.548 --> 07:42.810
This is Violet.

07:42.897 --> 07:45.465
Oh, she'’s a beauty.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.118
And...

07:47.205 --> 07:49.120
there'’s your daughter.

07:49.207 --> 07:51.906
Those eyes.

07:51.993 --> 07:55.866
The same beautiful eyes.

07:55.953 --> 07:58.608
Did she finally grow
into those big feet of hers?

07:58.695 --> 08:00.218
Almost.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.222
So...

08:04.309 --> 08:06.703
what happened with
the whole thing with you?

08:06.790 --> 08:10.098
Oh. Right to the chase, huh?

08:10.185 --> 08:12.492
It'’s okay,
you don'’t have to.

08:12.579 --> 08:13.580
No. No, no, no.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.059
That'’s why we'’re here.

08:15.146 --> 08:17.409
Um...

08:17.497 --> 08:21.239
Well... right after I turned 20,

08:21.326 --> 08:25.069
Bonnie'’s father got killed
in a motorcycle accident.

08:25.156 --> 08:28.420
And I didn'’t have no family
to help me out,

08:28.508 --> 08:30.510
so I had to get work,

08:30.597 --> 08:33.381
mostly cleaning houses.

08:33.469 --> 08:35.471
Um, I couldn'’t afford
a babysitter,

08:35.558 --> 08:39.388
so I got fired a lot
for bringing Bonnie with me.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.259
[sighs]

08:41.346 --> 08:42.522
It was bad.

08:43.871 --> 08:45.176
There were some days

08:45.263 --> 08:47.831
when I could barely afford
to feed her.

08:49.354 --> 08:51.661
I once gambled away
our rent money

08:51.748 --> 08:54.751
and ended up with
my kids in a motel.

08:54.838 --> 08:58.494
You trying to top my story?

08:58.581 --> 09:00.409
No, no.

09:00.496 --> 09:02.237
I'’m-I'’m sorry.
Go on.

09:02.324 --> 09:04.413
Well, anyway,

09:04.500 --> 09:08.635
the day that I moved us
into my car,

09:08.722 --> 09:12.073
I figured the only shot
she had at a decent life

09:12.160 --> 09:14.075
was if I put her in foster care.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.772
So...

09:15.859 --> 09:17.731
that'’s what I did.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.432
That'’s heartbreaking.

09:23.519 --> 09:26.566
I'’m glad she could be
a better mother to you

09:26.653 --> 09:28.045
than I was to her.

09:33.398 --> 09:36.053
Let'’s just say
it'’s a horse race.

09:38.142 --> 09:40.318
...not as simple as you think.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.582
She had no money,
she couldn'’t feed you.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.496
Giving you up broke her heart.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.107
Nice story.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.631
I'’m sticking with
the Disneyland terrorists.

09:48.718 --> 09:50.807
You need to see her.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.461
It might be your last chance.

09:52.548 --> 09:53.984
What are you talking about?

09:54.071 --> 09:57.466
The reason she reached out
to you is...

09:57.553 --> 09:58.598
she'’s dying.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.952
How long does she have?

10:05.039 --> 10:06.693
Couple months.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.521
I'’m going for a run.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.524
Really? Is that
the new thing with you?

10:12.612 --> 10:15.397
Every time you can'’t deal with
your feelings, you go jogging?

10:15.484 --> 10:17.399
[sighs]
You'’re right.

10:17.486 --> 10:19.053
Why don'’t you make some tea?

10:19.140 --> 10:21.011
We'’ll sit down
and talk about it.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.404
Thank you.

10:22.491 --> 10:25.276
Now you'’re acting like an adult.

10:25.363 --> 10:26.974
[door slams]

10:30.107 --> 10:31.979
I'’m still making tea.

10:41.945 --> 10:43.555
Five minutes,
and then we'’re out of here.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.340
I'’m really proud of you.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.385
Hey, if I were dying,
I know you'’d want to see me.

10:47.472 --> 10:50.171
Wouldn'’t miss it
for the world.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.347
Hello, Christy.

10:54.131 --> 10:55.480
CHRISTY:
Hi.

10:55.567 --> 10:58.005
Well, well, well.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.572
Mom...

11:00.660 --> 11:03.488
Finally decided to crawl out
from under your rock, huh?

11:03.575 --> 11:04.925
Mom, Mom, Mom.

11:05.012 --> 11:06.187
No, you brought me here--
I'’m doing this.

11:07.928 --> 11:10.321
You'’re a real piece of work,
wanting my forgiveness.

11:10.408 --> 11:11.671
Mom, please...

11:11.758 --> 11:13.716
I don'’t know
what you'’re dying of,

11:13.803 --> 11:16.676
but I hope it'’s
slow and painful.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.112
She'’s not your mother.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.637
You have a super day.

11:25.597 --> 11:26.511
Christy.

11:26.598 --> 11:28.209
Oh, good.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.211
[clears throat]

11:30.298 --> 11:31.603
This is your mother.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.518
Hello, Bonnie.

11:40.874 --> 11:43.224
Probably be more comfortable
if we sat down.

11:46.227 --> 11:47.750
I'’ll go first.

11:55.236 --> 11:56.759
Okay.
[chuckles]

12:03.244 --> 12:06.247
Well, I was wrong about it
being more comfortable.

12:09.119 --> 12:12.340
Thank you so much
for being willing to see me.

12:12.427 --> 12:13.733
I'’m only here
'’cause you'’re about to die.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.084
What do you got anyway?

12:17.171 --> 12:18.520
Uh, it'’s my heart.

12:18.607 --> 12:21.044
Something hereditary
we need to worry about?

12:21.131 --> 12:25.266
No, just years of hard living
finally caught up with me.

12:27.442 --> 12:30.358
Maybe we should worry a little.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.667
Honey, I-I...

12:35.755 --> 12:38.453
I knew what I was gonna say
to you when I saw you,

12:38.540 --> 12:40.455
but now I-I don'’t know
where to start.

12:42.892 --> 12:45.939
Just tell her
what you told me.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.683
Bonnie, giving you up
was the hardest thing

12:51.771 --> 12:54.991
and the worst mistake
I ever made in my whole life.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.515
But I want
you to know

12:57.602 --> 13:00.040
that I thought of you
every single day.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.693
Yeah, terrific.
Why didn'’t you come back?

13:01.781 --> 13:03.173
You said you were
gonna come back.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.740
Well, I wanted to. I tried.

13:04.827 --> 13:06.873
You left me bouncing
around foster homes.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.484
I was trying to make money,
trying to get on my feet.

13:09.571 --> 13:10.485
Yeah, so?

13:10.572 --> 13:12.574
It got complicated.

13:12.661 --> 13:13.836
What the hell does that mean?

13:13.923 --> 13:16.534
Oh, God.

13:16.621 --> 13:19.842
I was a cocktail waitress
in Tahoe.

13:19.929 --> 13:23.193
And I met this guy...

13:23.280 --> 13:25.152
and I moved in with him.

13:26.414 --> 13:27.458
And?

13:27.545 --> 13:30.331
And...

13:30.418 --> 13:31.506
Tell me.

13:33.029 --> 13:36.685
He said he didn'’t want
any kids around.

13:38.948 --> 13:40.558
I'’m sorry.

13:40.645 --> 13:42.212
I-I didn'’t know
this part.

13:42.299 --> 13:45.607
So you picked
your happiness over mine.

13:45.694 --> 13:48.262
I was young, I was scared.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.612
What can I say? I screwed up.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.744
No, I screwed up with her.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.356
What you did to me
is unforgivable.

13:55.443 --> 13:57.837
I know.

14:04.147 --> 14:06.933
On the bright side, she'’s dying.

14:14.462 --> 14:16.812
You were gone a long time.

14:16.899 --> 14:20.816
I decided to run
until I wasn'’t mad anymore.

14:20.903 --> 14:24.559
I went, like, 18 miles, puked
and had to take the bus back.

14:26.387 --> 14:29.433
Listen, Marjorie really
wanted to talk to you, so...

14:29.520 --> 14:31.783
Stop. I already know
what she'’s gonna say.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.089
I don'’t need
to hear it come out

14:33.176 --> 14:34.264
of her shrunken
little apple head.

14:34.351 --> 14:36.049
Hello, Bonnie.

14:37.702 --> 14:40.662
Do you not know
how to give a heads up?

14:42.229 --> 14:44.971
Sit down and listen
to the apple head.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.973
Let me guess-- you want me
to forgive my mother

14:47.060 --> 14:48.757
and invite her
back into my life.

14:48.844 --> 14:49.976
No, I just...

14:50.063 --> 14:51.934
That woman threw me away,

14:52.021 --> 14:54.937
and I'’ve spent every day since
then thinking I was unlovable.

14:55.024 --> 14:57.897
And sometimes you are.

14:59.507 --> 15:02.771
That being said,
there might be an alternative

15:02.858 --> 15:05.165
to hating your mother
for the rest of your life.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.994
You got my attention.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.101
Hi.

15:28.188 --> 15:29.102
Hi.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.103
Come on in.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.497
Thanks for seeing me.

15:33.584 --> 15:36.370
Oh, I was so happy
when you called.

15:36.457 --> 15:38.024
You want some coffee?

15:38.111 --> 15:39.112
Sure.

15:39.199 --> 15:40.461
Black okay?

15:40.548 --> 15:42.071
That'’s fine.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.510
[sighs softly]

15:46.597 --> 15:48.469
So how long have you lived here?

15:48.556 --> 15:50.297
About 20 years.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.341
It'’s nice.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.126
No, it ain'’t.

15:56.216 --> 15:57.826
No, it ain'’t.

15:57.913 --> 16:02.178
I guess you got a lot
of questions for me, huh?

16:02.265 --> 16:05.529
Well, yeah.

16:05.616 --> 16:07.531
I don'’t know anything
about my father.

16:07.618 --> 16:08.968
I don'’t even
know his name.

16:10.752 --> 16:12.014
It was Henry.

16:12.101 --> 16:14.364
Uh, just a terrific guy.

16:14.451 --> 16:17.019
Had a great sense of humor.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.108
He was handsome, tall.

16:20.936 --> 16:23.243
Couldn'’t ride a motorcycle
to save his life.

16:24.722 --> 16:25.767
Literally.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.510
So he wasn'’t
Paul Newman.

16:29.597 --> 16:31.468
And another
fantasy dies.

16:34.428 --> 16:37.257
I thought you might like
to have a picture of him.

16:42.479 --> 16:45.178
Is that... me he'’s holding?

16:45.265 --> 16:46.353
Yeah.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.745
Oh.

16:47.832 --> 16:49.573
What, was I about
two years old here?

16:49.660 --> 16:51.880
No, about six months.

16:55.318 --> 16:56.667
So what was your deal?

16:56.754 --> 16:58.234
Drugs? Booze?

16:58.321 --> 16:59.409
Sorry?

16:59.496 --> 17:01.150
Well, I just assumed

17:01.237 --> 17:03.587
if we'’re related, it must be one
or the other or both.

17:03.674 --> 17:04.632
Oh, no.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.763
Well, I smoked a little pot,

17:06.851 --> 17:08.983
but it just always
made me paranoid.

17:09.070 --> 17:12.596
And I never developed
a taste for alcohol.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.032
It has a taste?

17:15.859 --> 17:19.429
Uh, Christy told me
that you had a problem.

17:19.516 --> 17:22.084
But you seem to be
dealing with it.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.738
I'’m doing great.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.131
Yes, you are.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.483
Anyway...

17:31.311 --> 17:34.053
...I came here to, uh, tell you

17:34.140 --> 17:37.186
that, um, I forgive you.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.450
Mm, thank you.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.452
No, don'’t thank me.

17:42.539 --> 17:43.801
I'’m not doing it for you.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.586
I'’m doing it for me.

17:45.673 --> 17:46.891
What do you mean?

17:46.978 --> 17:49.807
Shirley, a good friend
of mine told me

17:49.894 --> 17:53.855
if I could forgive you,

17:53.942 --> 17:58.512
I could fi... finally be free
of all the anger in my heart.

17:58.599 --> 18:02.429
And I really...
need to be free of it.

18:04.257 --> 18:07.129
Because if I'’m not, I'’m, uh...

18:07.216 --> 18:09.262
I'’m gonna drink again.

18:10.785 --> 18:13.657
Or jog myself to death.

18:15.442 --> 18:16.704
That'’s good.

18:16.791 --> 18:19.359
Then we... we can start over.

18:19.446 --> 18:20.708
No, I don'’t think so.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.362
I-I... Just because
I forgive you

18:22.449 --> 18:24.103
doesn'’t mean I want you
in my life.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.672
That'’s something
my friend told me, too.

18:28.759 --> 18:30.674
Who'’s this friend?

18:30.761 --> 18:32.894
Well, to be honest,
she'’s not so much a friend

18:32.981 --> 18:35.462
as the... mother I never had.

18:37.768 --> 18:40.815
But I'’ll be damned
if I'’ll tell her that.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.950
Okay, uh, I got to go.

18:46.037 --> 18:47.648
Already?

18:47.735 --> 18:50.129
Am I... am I gonna
see you again?

18:50.216 --> 18:52.131
I don'’t know.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.132
Maybe.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.003
I need some time.

18:55.090 --> 18:58.224
Can I at least give you a hug?

18:58.311 --> 19:00.791
I'’m sorry, I
don'’t think so.

19:00.878 --> 19:02.141
Not... not yet.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.152
Thank you for the picture.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.815
[Shirley sobbing quietly]

19:39.526 --> 19:41.267
Did you have a nice time
at your dad'’s?

19:41.354 --> 19:42.746
Yeah, it was great.

19:42.833 --> 19:43.791
So, listen.

19:43.878 --> 19:45.140
I'’m a little confused.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.750
How long have you
known about her?

19:46.837 --> 19:49.449
Well, we met her
a couple days ago.

19:49.536 --> 19:50.754
So what do I call her?

19:50.841 --> 19:52.234
Great-Grandma?

19:52.321 --> 19:54.628
I think she'’d really like that.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.934
I made cookies.

20:00.590 --> 20:03.376
Who says you can'’t
pick your family?
