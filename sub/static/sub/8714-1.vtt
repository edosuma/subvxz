WEBVTT

00:30.997 --> 00:35.593
- [Girl] But I'm tired!
- It's the beginning of the day now. Come on.

00:35.668 --> 00:37.829
[Girl]
All right.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.314
[Giggling]
You're it.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.825
Forward!

01:07.333 --> 01:09.665
Now hold up.

01:12.105 --> 01:15.404
The Bible says, for everything,
there is a season.

01:15.475 --> 01:17.409
And after two years
of marriage...

01:17.477 --> 01:19.570
the time has finally come
for Willie and me...

01:19.646 --> 01:22.114
to put down roots
on a ranch of our own.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.215
- So long.
- { Narrating] We left the wagon train today...

01:29.289 --> 01:32.224
and are heading out alone through
desolate and beautiful country.

01:35.528 --> 01:38.964
It's not green like the farm.
More golden.

01:40.667 --> 01:44.364
As you can tell by my handwriting,
the way is pretty bumpy.

01:44.437 --> 01:47.770
Willie's worried we got
a late start leaving Denver.

01:47.841 --> 01:51.072
August is not a good month
to start up a ranch.

01:51.144 --> 01:54.511
I did get a full year of teaching in,
and we can use the money.

01:54.581 --> 01:57.311
We also may be starting up
something else.

01:57.383 --> 02:02.320
Namely, your first grandchild.
I haven't told Willie yet.

02:02.388 --> 02:04.652
He's got so much
on his mind already.

02:04.724 --> 02:07.887
There will be plenty of time
to tell him after we've settled.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.452
For everything,
there is a season.

02:19.572 --> 02:21.597
Willie, can you pull up
for a minute?

02:30.884 --> 02:34.081
[Retching]

02:34.154 --> 02:36.714
[Coughing]

02:47.400 --> 02:49.391
Feel better?

02:50.803 --> 02:52.794
Yes.

02:52.872 --> 02:55.739
You're bound to get sick
pitching around in that wagon.

02:55.808 --> 03:00.745
There's still a couple of hours left
of daylight. We can keep going if you want.

03:00.813 --> 03:04.579
Nah, that's okay.
We'll get an early start in the morning.

03:05.885 --> 03:08.820
Come on. I'll help you
get supper started.

03:15.828 --> 03:21.266
Looks like they're alone, Trent.
Just out for a little romantic ride in the country.

03:21.334 --> 03:24.770
Shouldn't we do a roundabout,
make sure they ain't part of a wagon train?

03:24.837 --> 03:26.828
[Grunts]

03:36.816 --> 03:40.445
[Neighing]

03:49.162 --> 03:51.096
I'm tired.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.462
What I'd like'd
be a hot bath...

03:53.533 --> 03:55.467
a bottle of whiskey
and a woman.

03:55.535 --> 03:58.265
- Well, one out of three ain't bad.
- What do you say?

03:58.338 --> 04:01.136
Enough talk.

04:01.207 --> 04:03.141
Let's make me rich today.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.319
- The sodbuster ties his gun down.
- So do we.

04:15.388 --> 04:19.825
But your average rancher
don't tie his gun down, Mason.

04:24.397 --> 04:27.628
- What do you say, Trent?
- Some other time maybe.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.018
- Welcome, folks.
- Thank you, sir.

05:22.088 --> 05:25.854
Frank Taylor. Proud owner of the greatest
general store in this parts.

05:25.925 --> 05:29.383
Oh, Missie LaHaye.
And this is my husband, Willie.

05:29.462 --> 05:32.226
Pleasure. You folks
just passing through?

05:32.298 --> 05:35.699
- We're figuring on staying.
- Well, that's good news to Texford Junction.

05:37.403 --> 05:41.134
Well, if you could just show us
the land offices, Mr. Taylorson.

05:41.207 --> 05:43.266
Yes, sir.
About two doors down.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.277
Good-bye.

05:46.946 --> 05:51.076
This is the track you'll be homesteading.
Just north of McClain Place.

05:51.150 --> 05:54.608
See? There's the main creek
threading through the middle...

05:54.687 --> 05:57.019
with plenty of branches
for the cattle to water.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.253
It's a good place to start a family.
Here's the deed.

06:00.326 --> 06:03.727
I wish you folks
the very best of luck.

06:03.796 --> 06:06.094
Many come. Not many last.

06:06.165 --> 06:09.601
- We'll last.
- With hard work and a lot of prayer.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.686
[Gasps]

06:29.422 --> 06:32.357
What are you doing?

06:44.670 --> 06:49.004
Next to marrying you,
this is the happiest day of my life.

06:49.075 --> 06:52.977
- Our life.
- Missie LaHaye...

06:53.045 --> 06:56.173
as God as my witness,
I swear to work harder...

06:56.249 --> 06:58.547
than any man to build you
a home on this land.

06:58.618 --> 07:01.416
And we'll raise a family...

07:01.487 --> 07:05.150
and watch generations after generations
of LaHayes thrive and prosper.

07:06.592 --> 07:09.789
Well, Willie, I have something
to say about that.

07:09.862 --> 07:14.026
- [Chicken Clucking]
- Hey, get back here. Get back here.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.126
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I didn't see nothing, mister, honest.

07:17.203 --> 07:20.502
[Both Laughing]

07:20.573 --> 07:23.371
Chicken thieves start early
in these parts.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.377
That's the first child
I've seen.

07:25.445 --> 07:29.848
Yep. Glad you brought
all those books just for that one.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.975
I'm sure there are more.

07:34.253 --> 07:36.813
First the ranch.

07:36.889 --> 07:39.551
Then teaching.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.025
- Then everything else.
- Everything else?

07:42.094 --> 07:47.157
You know what I mean. What were you gonna
tell me before that chicken butted in?

07:47.233 --> 07:52.500
Just that, uh-
that I'm happy too, Willie.

08:03.950 --> 08:07.215
- Hello, young man.
- Howdy.

08:07.286 --> 08:10.255
I'm Missie LaHaye.
What's your name?

08:10.323 --> 08:13.087
- Jeff Huff, ma'am.
- How old are you, Jeff Huff?

08:13.159 --> 08:15.753
- Twelve years old, ma'am.
- Did you catch that chicken?

08:15.828 --> 08:19.286
No. Got distracted
by your smooching.

08:19.365 --> 08:23.131
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Well, I'm sorry we caused you
to lose your chicken.

08:23.202 --> 08:26.638
Oh. Weren't mine, anyway.
Just fooling around.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.370
[Horses Neighing]

08:57.303 --> 08:59.999
- Willie.
- Sonny! Sonny!

09:00.072 --> 09:03.235
Where you been? I been waiting
so long for you to come back.

09:03.309 --> 09:07.177
Where have you been?
Sonny? Where you been, Sonny?

09:07.246 --> 09:09.407
[Mason]
"Where you been, Sonny?"

09:09.482 --> 09:12.144
[Chuckles]

09:12.218 --> 09:14.846
- Ow.
- Leave him be. I mean it.

09:14.921 --> 09:17.481
I'm just having a little fun
with your little brother, Sonny.

09:19.659 --> 09:23.026
Why don't you and I
go in and have a drink?

09:24.730 --> 09:26.664
Sonny...

09:27.900 --> 09:29.800
you can go play.

09:40.112 --> 09:43.138
- Don't go embarrassing me like that!
- Sorry, Sonny.

09:43.215 --> 09:45.445
Got you something.

09:57.430 --> 10:01.696
Easy there, Jeff. Don't that widow feed you?
I pay her good money.

10:01.767 --> 10:05.225
I don't like it there, Sonny.
I wanna go with you.

10:05.304 --> 10:08.034
Yeah, well, you can't.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.575
I told you that
a hundred times.

10:24.857 --> 10:26.848
Whoa.

10:30.396 --> 10:33.832
I'll build you a house
a lot better than that one.

10:33.899 --> 10:37.858
Oh, no. Willie,
this house is just fine.

10:38.838 --> 10:40.669
Let's go take a look.

10:59.058 --> 11:01.253
[Missie Gasps]

11:09.502 --> 11:11.868
[Clears Throat]

11:11.937 --> 11:16.567
Humble as it may be, sweetheart, this is
the first home of our own that we've ever had.

11:23.916 --> 11:26.714
[Giggles]

11:47.707 --> 11:51.199
- No stove.
- I can use the fireplace.

11:51.277 --> 11:54.440
My cooking can't get
any worse than it is right now.

12:00.619 --> 12:04.248
Lord, bless this house
and all who enter.

12:04.323 --> 12:06.314
[Together]
Amen.

12:41.093 --> 12:45.757
Sometimes I can almost hear
your voices in the soft prairie wind.

12:59.812 --> 13:02.144
I worry about Willie.

13:02.214 --> 13:05.581
He works with a ferocity
that sometimes scares me.

13:05.651 --> 13:08.211
He's so concerned
we won't be ready for winter.

13:10.990 --> 13:14.824
I've still not found the right time
to tell him about the baby.

13:27.139 --> 13:30.199
Willie and I went riding
over our land.

13:30.276 --> 13:33.109
What a beautiful country
the Lord has made.

13:38.784 --> 13:41.412
Just the other day,
we saw Indians on our ridgeline.

13:43.689 --> 13:45.919
Willie is very concerned
for my safety...

13:45.991 --> 13:49.518
though there hasn't been any Indian attacks
in years in these parts.

14:14.486 --> 14:18.081
Willie and I are sending you a treasure map
to our hard-earned savings...

14:18.157 --> 14:21.649
which we just buried in
the wilds of our new ranch.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.444
I certainly hope
you never need to use it.

14:41.513 --> 14:44.141
Willie doesn't trust
banks out here.

14:44.216 --> 14:47.344
But then, this is
a strange and wild place.

14:52.591 --> 14:55.116
I've been punching cattle
over three years, Mr. LaHaye.

14:55.194 --> 14:58.129
I'm not as experienced as some,
but more than others.

14:58.197 --> 15:02.429
- Where you hail from, Henry?
- What does that matter? I'm here now.

15:06.305 --> 15:08.603
All right.

15:08.674 --> 15:10.938
I suppose it's none
of my business anyway.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.944
- No offense.
- None taken...

15:13.012 --> 15:16.175
if... you give me a job.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.007
How.

16:21.847 --> 16:24.577
Uh, I'm Missie LaHaye.

16:24.650 --> 16:29.178
My husband and I,
uh, homestead this place.

16:29.254 --> 16:31.279
We raise, uh, cattle.

16:33.993 --> 16:38.396
This "how," what is
that supposed to mean?

16:38.464 --> 16:40.557
You speak English?

16:40.632 --> 16:43.430
That's what they tell me.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.732
I'm Miriam Red Hawk McClain.

16:45.804 --> 16:48.034
Married to Sean McClain?

16:48.107 --> 16:51.076
We homestead the next tract
to the south of here.

16:51.143 --> 16:54.306
- Oh, we're neighbors.
- Mm-hmm. Yes, ma'am.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.940
Oh!

16:57.016 --> 16:58.950
Please. Please come in.

17:00.953 --> 17:04.513
- I don't understand, mister-
- Just Scottie's fine.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.284
Been cowboying
since I was a kid.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.294
I've done everything
there is to do.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.990
How come you haven't been hired
by one of the big outfits?

17:16.734 --> 17:21.569
I can't use this no more,
so most people think I'm washed up.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.503
But I learned
to get by with my left.

17:27.846 --> 17:31.338
You take me on, Mr. LaHaye,
and I won't let you down.

17:35.654 --> 17:38.248
You got yourself a job.

17:45.564 --> 17:50.331
Uh, I'm just getting started.
Trying to make this place into a home.

17:51.770 --> 17:53.931
Please, sit.

17:58.510 --> 18:03.140
I think I have one last jar
of strawberry preserves...

18:04.550 --> 18:08.509
that I've been saving
for just such an occasion.

18:13.392 --> 18:15.383
Please, here.

18:19.131 --> 18:22.623
Now, this here is a county fair
blue ribbon winner.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.072
Mm. Mm.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.845
This is very good. You must teach me
how to make this.

18:35.914 --> 18:40.647
Oh, my mother made it.
I'm not a very good cook.

18:40.719 --> 18:44.018
When I was growing up,
I mostly helped out my pa-

18:44.089 --> 18:48.025
riding horses, plowing the field,
tending to the chickens.

18:48.093 --> 18:50.391
Then you will do
very well here.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.396
Many women who come here
are soft.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.830
They don't know how to do
these things. You do.

18:54.900 --> 18:59.166
Still, I feel that my husband
would prefer a good meal.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.706
I brought you some things.

19:03.775 --> 19:08.007
It is too late to start a garden this year,
so corn, potatoes, beets.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.675
- Oh, thank you, Miriam.
- We are neighbors.

19:11.750 --> 19:15.846
The last family was here, well,
they could have asked us for more help...

19:15.921 --> 19:20.187
but... I think
they feared my Shoshone ways.

19:20.259 --> 19:25.663
Oh, well, my husband and I will be grateful
for whatever help we can get.

19:25.731 --> 19:27.961
Um, what is in there?

19:28.033 --> 19:32.402
- The secret to flaky biscuits.
- [Sniffs]

19:32.471 --> 19:35.099
- Pig lard.
- [Gagging]

19:35.174 --> 19:38.610
Excuse me. Sorry, sorry.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.482
- [Lowing]
- [Chattering]

19:55.561 --> 19:58.052
- What do you think about these?
- You could breed 'em.

20:03.969 --> 20:06.437
- Would you be Mr. LaHaye?
- I would.

20:06.505 --> 20:10.134
Well, I'm Fyn Anders.
I would like job, sir, if please.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.677
Uh, what kind of foreigner
is you, son?

20:12.744 --> 20:14.871
I come from Norway on boat...

20:14.947 --> 20:18.348
to find adventure
in the big, wide open spaces.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.351
Well, you have any experience
around cattle?

20:20.419 --> 20:25.356
No, sir. But I am big,
strong. Own horse.

20:25.424 --> 20:30.691
Well, Fyn Anders from Norway,
this'll be strictly trial basis.

20:32.164 --> 20:35.190
- Hope you learn fast.
- Don't worry, Mr. LaHaye.

20:35.267 --> 20:40.170
I learn good and fast.
You betcha.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.704
- What do you think?
- Probably 40 or 50-

20:46.778 --> 20:48.439
Good cow.

20:48.513 --> 20:52.108
The boys will love the jam.
And so will their pa.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.675
Sure I can't give you
any biscuits.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.448
No.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.857
Thank you, though.

20:59.925 --> 21:03.156
Well, maybe next time
I'll make them with the pig lard.

21:03.228 --> 21:05.162
[Both Laughing]

21:05.230 --> 21:07.221
If I don't retch.

21:10.435 --> 21:14.997
When you're ready to bring this little one
into the world, I will be there.

21:16.642 --> 21:20.476
- I've delivered many babies.
- Oh, Miriam, thank you!

21:35.060 --> 21:37.654
- I'll bring some books for the boys.
- Good.

21:37.729 --> 21:41.597
I don't want them growing up
illiterate like their pa.

21:41.667 --> 21:43.692
Very nice to meet you,
neighbor.

21:43.769 --> 21:45.498
You too.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.749
Here comes trouble.

22:07.292 --> 22:12.025
I, uh, heard you were
hiring some cowpokes.

22:12.097 --> 22:14.190
Jobs are filled.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.962
Oh, this is the bunch
you hired.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.601
You're really scratching
the bottom of the barrel.

22:20.672 --> 22:25.234
Too bad you just couldn't have waited
a bit, hired some real men.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.244
Just where would I find
these real men?

22:27.312 --> 22:29.212

22:38.123 --> 22:41.388
but most important,
we can shoot.

Hey, mister. I bet you can't
shoot worth nothing.

23:11.123 --> 23:14.320
How would you feel about hiring
on another broke-down old cowboy?

23:14.393 --> 23:18.124
Well, I suppose I wouldn't feel
so good about that, mister-

23:18.196 --> 23:21.188
- My name is Cookie.
- You're a cook.

the exact moment...

25:14.546 --> 25:16.707

told me about you.

I was standing in the kitchen
eating breakfast...

your mother looked when she told me.

And as for you, my strong daughter,
I hope you are feeling well...

I'm crying.

35:50.615 --> 35:52.378

Miriam McClain to us.

a thing like that?

37:09.860 --> 37:13.421
I'd like to raise
a coffee cup to, uh-

37:13.497 --> 37:16.830
seeing as this is the strongest we got-
to Mr. And Mrs. LaHaye...

37:16.901 --> 37:18.926

37:35.353 --> 37:38.322
What is it? I'm awake.

37:38.389 --> 37:42.348
They were just so kind
and concerned tonight.

37:44.195 --> 37:47.323
- The hands?
- Mm-hmm.

37:47.398 --> 37:49.389
Yep.

37:52.270 --> 37:56.036
What about their families?

37:56.107 --> 37:58.837
I really don't know
much about them.

38:00.044 --> 38:02.376
But they're good workers.

38:02.446 --> 38:06.348
And that's the most
important thing.

38:06.417 --> 38:09.580
Shouldn't we know
if they have families or not?

38:10.755 --> 38:14.054

38:14.125 --> 38:18.459

to get away from things.

38:19.864 --> 38:21.855
You gotta respect that.

38:24.702 --> 38:27.967

such a lonely life.

- [Chuckles]

39:08.813 --> 39:11.111

Well, looks like they figured it
all by their lonesome.

39:15.720 --> 39:18.382
Let's make me rich today.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.806
Willie says you know
the good book.

39:36.874 --> 39:40.469
Sunday mornings, my husband
and I read the Bible and pray together.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.876
You're invited to join us.

39:42.947 --> 39:46.439
Well, thank you, Mrs. LaHaye,
but, uh, I don't think so.

39:46.517 --> 39:50.647
- Aren't you a churchgoing man?
- Actually, I used to be a preacher.

39:50.721 --> 39:54.623
- A preacher?
- Yeah, well...

39:54.692 --> 39:57.160

39:58.496 --> 40:00.589
and the Lord taketh away.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.664

from you?

40:06.036 --> 40:08.027
Something very special.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.554
Mrs. McClain, I know
when we first met I was-

41:05.629 --> 41:09.429
Out here, neighbors need
one another, Mr. LaHaye.

41:09.500 --> 41:12.230
I couldn't agree more.

41:12.303 --> 41:15.397
- Please.
- Thank you.

41:43.167 --> 41:46.534
Basically,
you just take it up-

41:53.644 --> 41:57.444
Well, practiced lots of hours
to make it look like that.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.075
Okay, come here.
Remember how I showed you.

42:00.150 --> 42:04.052
You coil it in your left hand, like that.
Make sure there ain't no kinks in the line.

42:04.121 --> 42:06.817
This is the noose.

42:06.891 --> 42:09.553
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

42:09.627 --> 42:11.686
Let's see what you got.

42:15.299 --> 42:19.668
Now loosen your wrist.
When you're ready, cast it off.

42:21.972 --> 42:23.997
Oh, missed again.

42:24.074 --> 42:27.635
That's all right. Keep practicing.
I'll get another rope.

42:38.155 --> 42:40.282
I'm Missie LaHaye.

42:40.357 --> 42:42.757
He seems like a nice boy.

42:42.826 --> 42:44.760
My brother.

42:44.828 --> 42:47.956
I'm glad to hear
that he has family.

42:48.032 --> 42:51.092
- I've been a little worried about him.
- He's fine.

42:51.168 --> 42:54.194
And your mother and father?

42:55.205 --> 42:57.139
They're gone.

42:57.207 --> 42:58.765
No offense, ma'am...

42:58.842 --> 43:02.141
but it ain't your business worrying
about someone's not your kin.

43:02.212 --> 43:05.613
It's just Christian charity,
Mr. Huff.

43:09.687 --> 43:11.848
I hope we're not
interrupting you, ma'am.

43:11.922 --> 43:14.288
What do you want, Trent?

43:14.358 --> 43:17.885
I think you'd better
get saddled up.

43:17.962 --> 43:20.590
We got some riding
to do.

43:27.137 --> 43:30.538
Sonny. I did it.
I roped the post.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.940
Gotta go now.

43:33.010 --> 43:35.376
Behave yourself.
Keep practicing.

43:35.446 --> 43:39.439
- You'll be back though.
- You know it.

43:39.516 --> 43:42.212
You got my rope.

43:57.568 --> 43:59.661
Is Sonny gone a lot?

43:59.737 --> 44:02.297
It's his job.

44:02.373 --> 44:05.536
He's making money so we can have
a ranch of our own someday.

44:05.609 --> 44:08.077
He sounds like
a very good brother.

44:14.852 --> 44:17.446
[Lowing]

44:24.128 --> 44:26.062
Got yourself a strong breed.

44:26.130 --> 44:30.624

Let's call it a day.

44:39.276 --> 44:42.040
Now, children...
and Mr. McClain...

44:42.112 --> 44:46.378
I want you to write
these letters on your slates...

44:46.450 --> 44:48.475
and then sound them out.

44:48.552 --> 44:50.486
And when you know them...

44:50.554 --> 44:53.250
you'll have mastered
the entire alphabet.

44:54.591 --> 44:56.957
Help each other out now.

45:01.365 --> 45:03.925
The weather's turning cold...

45:04.001 --> 45:06.469
and Sharp Claw and his camp
will be leaving tomorrow...

45:06.537 --> 45:09.734
and you probably shouldn't
get a chill riding over.

45:09.807 --> 45:13.106
So, this is my last class
for a while?

45:13.177 --> 45:16.169
The children have learned
much from you, Mrs. LaHaye.

45:26.890 --> 45:30.155
Keep at it,
Mr. McClain.

45:30.227 --> 45:34.288
Having a turbulent time
finding a word that starts with an "X."

45:34.364 --> 45:36.298
[Chuckles]
That is a difficult letter.

45:39.870 --> 45:42.964
Well, not
for much longer.

45:47.878 --> 45:49.869
Thank you.

45:57.020 --> 45:59.147
Snow'll be coming soon.

46:00.524 --> 46:03.618
Now remember, really sound out
the words with them.

46:05.229 --> 46:08.357
And when you come back, they'll be
ready for the advanced readers.

46:08.432 --> 46:10.559
I'll keep them on it.

46:10.634 --> 46:13.102
Good.

46:13.170 --> 46:15.695
God go with you
and your family, Sharp Claw.

46:15.773 --> 46:17.900
Thank you.

46:17.975 --> 46:21.308
And, Miriam,
I'll be seeing you.

46:21.378 --> 46:23.642
Yes, you will.

46:23.714 --> 46:25.648
Safe travels.

46:25.716 --> 46:28.514
Thank you. Good-bye.

46:30.988 --> 46:32.979
[Missie]
Come on!

46:39.096 --> 46:41.496
to ensure the livestock
survive the long winter.

46:41.565 --> 46:45.399
And that over there
is gonna be all your peas.

46:45.469 --> 46:49.235
Cookie and I have prepared the soil
for a large garden next spring.

46:49.306 --> 46:52.332
I so enjoy his companionship
and his cooking.

46:52.409 --> 46:56.175
Here I just might make
a- a sweet tater patch.

46:56.246 --> 46:58.510
- Oh.
- Have large taters in here.

47:06.790 --> 47:08.655
It's all coming together.

47:08.725 --> 47:12.456
It's beginning
to feel like... home.

47:19.670 --> 47:22.833
[Men Chattering]

47:22.906 --> 47:26.398
Now, as we wait for snow, the ranch hands
have time to go into town...

47:26.476 --> 47:29.001
for some well deserved
relaxation.

47:29.079 --> 47:32.879
- This time I got a better hand-
- { Scottie] Don't tell us what you got.

47:51.068 --> 47:53.798
Maybe more now,
knowing the baby's coming.

47:58.876 --> 48:00.810
As we prepare for winter...

48:00.878 --> 48:05.645
I'm reminded of Isaiah preparing
the way for our savior's birth...

48:05.716 --> 48:09.208
and I think warmly of all of you
as Christmas approaches.

48:13.757 --> 48:16.248
[Shivering]

48:20.530 --> 48:23.090
Are you warm enough?

48:23.166 --> 48:25.157
I'm fine.

48:25.235 --> 48:28.693
Why are you always so warm?
Even your feet.

48:28.772 --> 48:31.673
Well, someone's gotta warm them
icy toes of yours.

48:31.742 --> 48:34.575
[Laughs, Sighs]

48:34.645 --> 48:36.670
I guess that's why
we're a perfect match.

48:38.382 --> 48:42.614
The sky looks like snow.
We're lucky it held off this long.

48:44.354 --> 48:46.549
You know,
I was thinking today...

48:46.623 --> 48:49.114
this is gonna be our first Christmas
in this house, Willie.

48:51.094 --> 48:55.155
I bet you miss your family and all those
family traditions you talk about.

48:56.700 --> 48:59.828
Yeah, sure, I miss them.

48:59.903 --> 49:02.098
But we'll start
new traditions here.

49:02.172 --> 49:04.367
Well, with the weather
settling in...

49:04.441 --> 49:08.070
this might be our last chance
getting to town for a while.

49:08.145 --> 49:10.477
Better tell Santa
what you want for Christmas.

49:10.547 --> 49:15.382
No, nothing store bought.
That would be just a waste of money.

49:15.452 --> 49:17.818
Well, what then?

49:19.523 --> 49:22.048
All I want for Christmas
is to be surrounded...

49:22.125 --> 49:24.992
by the people
we care about.

49:36.940 --> 49:38.999
This here's mine.

49:39.076 --> 49:41.567
No.
[Coughs]

49:43.914 --> 49:45.905
You got the watch.

49:46.950 --> 49:50.283
I got the watch...

49:50.354 --> 49:53.050
because mine broke.

49:53.123 --> 49:56.854
It's a practical thing.
I have to know the time...

49:56.927 --> 49:59.395
in order to steal.

50:00.797 --> 50:02.890
Gimme more money.

50:03.834 --> 50:06.564
No.

50:06.636 --> 50:09.127
You got two brooches
and a watch, and I don't got none of that.

50:12.809 --> 50:15.573
You ever wish you had
a place to call your own?

50:24.721 --> 50:26.951
[No Audible Dialogue]

50:28.191 --> 50:30.659
More coffee?

50:30.727 --> 50:33.389
Thank you.

50:44.841 --> 50:47.901
Mrs. LaHaye would
like to say something.

50:47.978 --> 50:51.004
Well, as you all know...

50:51.081 --> 50:53.413
Christmas will be here
before we know it.

50:53.483 --> 50:56.816
Santa Claus will never find us
all the way out here, I bet.

50:56.887 --> 51:00.653
Well, he will if my wife
has anything to say about it.

51:00.724 --> 51:05.024
Willie and I would like to cordially invite
you all to Christmas dinner.

51:07.230 --> 51:09.664
Unless you have
other places to be.

51:14.671 --> 51:18.300
Well, then that settles it.
Christmas dinner with all the trimmings.

51:18.375 --> 51:20.309
Trimmings?

51:20.377 --> 51:22.845
Now, where do you
rustle up some of those?

51:22.913 --> 51:25.711
Well, I was hoping you
might help me, Cookie.

51:34.424 --> 51:36.358
I got that.

51:36.426 --> 51:38.986
Mrs. LaHaye! Mrs. LaHaye!

51:39.062 --> 51:42.361
- Jeff. What is it?
- Mrs. LaHaye, I got something.

51:42.432 --> 51:44.195
- From Sonny.
- What's it say?

51:45.202 --> 51:48.296
Not sure.

51:48.371 --> 51:50.362
Come here.

52:02.953 --> 52:05.979
"Dear little brother,
it's real hot here.

52:06.056 --> 52:09.856
"I'll bring you some beans
that jump all by themselves.

52:09.926 --> 52:13.828
"Stay good, and I'll
see you after Christmas.

52:13.897 --> 52:15.922
Sonny."

52:19.936 --> 52:22.302
Best be going, Missie.

52:23.406 --> 52:25.704
Well, thank you,
Mrs. LaHaye.

52:39.422 --> 52:43.017
That boy's got
one speed- runnin'.

52:51.034 --> 52:54.902
I think on how long the world
lay in darkness...

52:54.971 --> 52:58.634
before the light of the world
was born in that humble little stable.

53:00.277 --> 53:03.940
We have been blessed
to receive his light.

53:04.014 --> 53:07.973
Not only to live in hope ourselves,
but to take hope to others.

53:08.051 --> 53:13.648
I am sending you something which I know
you'll remember from many Christmases past.

53:13.723 --> 53:17.284
May it start a new tradition
in the LaHaye household...

53:17.360 --> 53:20.227
and remind you
we are there in spirit...

53:20.297 --> 53:23.733
sharing your first
Christmas on the ranch.

53:23.800 --> 53:25.734
And know we will miss you...

53:25.802 --> 53:29.135
but our hearts are forever
knit together in love.

53:41.351 --> 53:44.809
Round. Take it
round there, Henry.

53:44.888 --> 53:46.856
Round. Here.

53:46.923 --> 53:50.086
Here. Fyn.
Come on, Fyn. Hurry up.

53:54.831 --> 53:58.358
I just don't understand why Willie had to
go into town on Christmas Eve.

53:58.435 --> 54:01.495
Oh, I'm sure he'll
be along shortly, ma'am.

54:08.578 --> 54:11.945
Willie LaHaye, where have you been?
It's Christmas Eve!

54:12.015 --> 54:14.040
I know.

54:14.117 --> 54:16.176
There's gonna be one more
for Christmas, Missie.

54:17.787 --> 54:19.948
Merry Christmas,
Mrs. LaHaye.

54:21.524 --> 54:24.550
Merry Christmas, Jeff.

Please come in.
Come in.

54:42.712 --> 54:46.273

one thing missing.

stood on top...

54:59.095 --> 55:03.327
of every Christmas tree
we had when I was growing up.

Mm, thank you,
Mrs. LaHaye. This is...

55:43.807 --> 55:48.107
the finest Christmas dinner
I've had in many a year.

55:48.178 --> 55:51.614
Many a year?
It's the best one I ever had.

55:53.183 --> 55:55.981
Well, thank you, but I couldn't have
done it without Cookie.

55:56.052 --> 55:58.543
Well, thank you, ma'am.

56:00.190 --> 56:02.124
Now is it time
to open presents?

56:06.663 --> 56:09.325
Yes, Jeff, I think now
it's time to open presents.

56:14.304 --> 56:16.329
All right.

I ever had.

present I ever got.

Well, gentlemen, I know how you all
feel about Bible reading...

57:29.779 --> 57:32.304
but it wouldn't be
Christmas without it.

57:32.382 --> 57:35.146
So, you are welcome to stay,
but if you want to leave-

57:35.218 --> 57:38.847
l- I believe I'd
like to stay, ma'am.

57:38.922 --> 57:41.891
Yeah, I'd like to stay too.

and decent with you guys?

some privacy.

real nice of you, Trent.

to tell you about.

Um, it's kinda hard
to know where to start.

As long as the old man
don't blow it.

01:00:49.178 --> 01:00:51.112
Mind if I sit in?

Uh, I'm out.

Just a few more hands.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.745
I can win it all back.
I feel it.

Uh, let's go, Fyn. You're almost
out of money anyway.

- LaHayes doesn't pay you.
- Well, like all cowboys...

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:07.625
we get paid
when the cattle is sold.

01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:10.928
No, no, no.
Mr. LaHaye pay us anyway.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.902

dollar bills just to pay us.

It's like a-
a buried treasure.

be going too.

makes them the way they is...

it bides
looking into sometime.

Henry, will you be so kind
as to lead us in prayer?

I don't know, ma'am. I'm-

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:20.192
I'm afraid I'm
out of practice.

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:24.899
Kind of-
Kind of hard to...

01:02:24.974 --> 01:02:27.169
start.

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:30.212
It's okay to stumble.

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:32.213
He's ready to catch you.

[Clears Throat]

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:46.785
Lord, sometimes...

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:50.993
we look
but don't perceive.

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:58.068
Sometimes we listen
but don't understand.

01:02:58.141 --> 01:03:02.305
Please, open our ears
and eyes...

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:04.369
to your truth.

01:03:05.748 --> 01:03:07.739
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:10.217
- Amen.
- { Knocking]

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:13.050
It's open to
everyone on Sunday.

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:19.350
Oh, Fyn. Oh, I'm so happy to see you.
Please come in.

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:30.064
Sorry, boss.
He got the jump on me.

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:32.266
- What do you want?
- I want your money.

01:03:33.776 --> 01:03:35.607
Let's go.
Follow him.

01:03:35.678 --> 01:03:37.646
Get up.
Move it out.

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:42.251
Hey, there, come on.!

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:44.684
Let's go.
Come on.

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:47.746
Come on. Come on.
Good Sunday morning to y'all.

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:03.438
Sonny?

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:10.811
Jeff, l- I didn't know.
I thought you was in town.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.110
What ya doing?

01:04:14.717 --> 01:04:16.776
Ain't this sweet?

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:20.050
All right,
all of you, sit down.

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:22.215
Come on.

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:27.152
You too, kid.

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:29.494
Just do as the man says.

01:04:34.003 --> 01:04:37.131
I'll just go over
and get my treasure map.

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:38.798
Leave her alone!

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:41.300
Now...

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:44.744
I missed on purpose,
but I won't do it twice.

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.782
Please. You can see
she's expecting.

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:48.783
So am I.

01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:51.649
I'm expecting to come back here
with more money than I left with.

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:55.451
I don't know what makes you
think that there's any money.

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:59.517
Well, your Norwegian cowpoke...

01:04:59.595 --> 01:05:03.531
has a tendency to run off at the mouth
after a couple of pints.

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:06.090
Showing off his money,
and bragging about...

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:09.831
how his boss has a treasure
buried on his land.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:12.272
Tie him up.

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:20.514
You do as he says, Missie,
you'll be all right.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:23.143
You remember where
we dug that hole?

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:26.279
- I think I remember.
- You'll be fine.

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:31.186
All right.
Enough said.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.285
Let's make me rich today.

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:35.330
Hyah.!

01:05:48.811 --> 01:05:50.802
Hurry it up.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:54.247
- I need something to dig with.
- Well, then use your hands.

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:56.478
Make it quick.

01:06:06.929 --> 01:06:09.454
Is that it or not?

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.560
Well, then toss it over.

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:39.393
You're gonna have to show me where
the rest of the money is.

01:06:39.462 --> 01:06:42.954
But y-you have all the money.
There is no more.

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:45.500
No, I don't have
all the money.

01:06:45.568 --> 01:06:49.732
'Cause that Norwegian,
he wasn't spending silver.

01:06:49.805 --> 01:06:52.239
He was spending cash.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:05.112
I could just about eat me
a whole side of beef right now.

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:09.624
Well, if you turn me loose,
I'll cook you whatever you want.

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:12.957
- Like rat stew.
- Oh, and now how stupid you think I am?

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.554
You're working for Trent,
ain't you?

01:07:15.631 --> 01:07:17.963
Equal partners is what we is.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:20.002
That right, Sonny?

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:22.731
You equal partners
with these lowlifes?

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:25.501
Shut your mouth!

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:29.905
[Chuckles]
Ooh.

01:07:29.979 --> 01:07:31.810
Why don't you tell
your brother, Sonny?

01:07:33.482 --> 01:07:36.246
Why don't you tell him what
you do to make money?

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:38.582
Tell him how all you do
is rob innocent people.

01:07:38.654 --> 01:07:40.588
Probably been involved
in a murder or two.

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:42.453
That's a lie!

01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:45.585
Tell him he's wrong, Sonny.
You ain't never killed nobody.

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:49.495
Tell him, Sonny. Tell-Tell him
you ain't like these other bad men.

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:54.261
I ain't never
killed nobody. Never.

01:07:57.873 --> 01:08:01.036
Don't you see?

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:03.578
I'm doing this
for us, Jeff.

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:06.342
Our future. You and me
and the life we're trying to have.

01:08:06.415 --> 01:08:10.146
No, Sonny.
You can't mean that.

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:12.517
What would Ma and Pa say
about your thieving ways?

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:14.647
They'd say,
"Good for you, Sonny.

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:17.953
Trying to make a life for
you and your little brother. '"

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:20.086
So you think...

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:23.689
they're looking down from heaven
right now, and they're proud of you?

01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:26.758
Aren't you tired of living
in that boardinghouse?

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:30.703
Huh? No place
that's really yours?

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:32.741
I want a better life
for us, Jeff.

01:08:32.808 --> 01:08:34.832
That's why I'm doing this.

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:37.935
These folks are
my friends, Sonny.

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:40.379
Mrs. LaHaye been
teaching me to read.

01:08:40.448 --> 01:08:44.145
Mr. LaHaye fetches me for the Sunday
meetings, and he's teaching me ranching.

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:48.953
These are the kind of people things always
work out for. They'll be fine.

01:08:49.024 --> 01:08:52.255
We ain't taking nothing from them
they can't get back 10 times over.

01:08:56.932 --> 01:09:00.662
When this is over, you and me
can spend all the time you want together.

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:25.024
Get it out of there.

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:32.863
Toss it to me.

01:09:51.819 --> 01:09:54.812
- You got a key for this?
- No.

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:02.993
Don't you trust
nobody anymore?

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:13.131
Oh, my,
isn't that pretty?

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.336
- Whoo-wee.
- { Gun Cocks]

01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:17.140
Put your hands in the air.

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.649
You know how to use that?

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:29.652
I missed on purpose.

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:31.989
I won't do it twice.

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.325
Shooting a man's
a different story.

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:38.162
A good Christian woman
like yourself wouldn't hurt anyone.

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:40.202
So what you gonna do?

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:51.543
That's two more shots.

01:10:55.117 --> 01:10:57.551
- [Yells]
- [Grunts]

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:26.147
This is for your own good.

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:38.187
Look.

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:42.055
Where's the woman, Trent?
What did you do?

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:43.758
Mi-

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:46.027
Where is she?
Go get her! Go find her!

01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:48.865
- What are you doing here?
- It's all right, Jeff. I will. I will.

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:51.030
- Get her.
- Jeff, it's all right.

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:53.404
Listen to me.
Listen to me. I will, Jeff.

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.670
What'd you do with that girl?
Where is she?

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:58.508
It's all right.
It's all right, Jeff.

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.605
It's all right.
Where is she, Trent?

01:12:00.683 --> 01:12:05.052
You'd better tell me
she ain't hurt, or so help me.

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:16.353
Drop your gun, Sonny,
or he's dead.

01:12:16.432 --> 01:12:18.457
Missie.

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:22.364
- Missie?
- Sonny, go cut Willie loose...

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:24.406
and don't you
so much as nick him.

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:34.312
Find it hard to believe
you got the drop on Trent.

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:36.647
I got his gun
and his dignity.

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:53.393
Missie, pick up the gun,
and move away from him.

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:06.840
Looks like you got me.

01:13:06.915 --> 01:13:11.181
Sonny, tie him up.
Just like you did us.

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:14.017
Then maybe we'll ask
the law to spare your life.

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:20.961
Here, let me help you
with that, Sonny.

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:28.031
Sonny!

01:13:33.342 --> 01:13:35.776
[Wheezing]

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:38.108
It's okay.
Just don't go away, Sonny.

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:40.114
Don't go.

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:42.047
Don't go away.

01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:46.186
Fix him up, won't ya?
He wouldn't have hurt ya.

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:49.622
Oh, I would fix him if I could.
I knew he wouldn't hurt me.

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:56.122
I'm so sorry for
what I done, ma'am.

01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:58.132
Please forgive me.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:01.499
Don't hold my deeds
against him.

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:03.538
He's got no one now.

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:05.971
He's got nobody.

01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:08.373
Oh, no, forgiveness
is yours, Sonny.

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:10.742
He'll be with us now,
I promise.

01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:21.380
You grow up to be a man...

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:25.757
that Pa would be proud of,
you hear me, Jeff?

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:28.422
I will.

01:14:28.497 --> 01:14:33.332
And you promise me you won't
spend your days missing me.

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:35.768
Ask me no questions...

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:37.931
I'll tell you no lies.

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.575
I'll pray for you, Sonny.

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:47.046
Now, don't go wasting
your prayers on me, ma'am.

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:53.686
I done too many bad things
for God to be forgivin'.

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:56.747
Long ago,
there was a thief...

01:14:56.825 --> 01:14:59.055
left on a cross to die,
just like you, Sonny.

01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:05.088
But then he heard the glorious words
of the Lord about redemption.

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:08.193
And he knew that very day
he was gonna be in paradise.

01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:12.606
He's waiting
for you, Sonny.

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:16.143
Go with God.

01:15:55.284 --> 01:16:00.620
"Thou anointest my head with oil,
and my cup runneth over.

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:03.180
"Surely, goodness and mercy...

01:16:03.258 --> 01:16:07.490
"shall follow me
all the days of my life-

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:12.091
and I will dwell in
the house of the Lord forever. '"

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:14.328
Amen.

01:16:32.754 --> 01:16:36.383
Jeff's part of
our family now.

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:40.459
Yep.

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:42.861
If someday he wants to
take the LaHaye name...

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:46.592
I'd be fine
with that too.

01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:51.195
That would
be nice, Willie.

01:16:57.212 --> 01:17:00.545
We are gonna need
a bigger house.

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:03.050
I was thinking I could
knock out this back wall...

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:05.086
maybe put in
a bedroom or two.

01:17:05.153 --> 01:17:07.087
- Maybe-
- [Inhales] Willie.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:14.528
- Yeah?
- I think maybe you should put your boots back on.

01:17:17.065 --> 01:17:18.828
It's time.

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.892
But Miriam said we were
still a few weeks away.

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:24.666
No, I think you'd best
be getting Miriam.

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:27.038
Now.

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:29.043
What's the matter?

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:35.109
You're gonna sleep in the bunkhouse
tonight, Jeff, just like a real cowboy.

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:38.513
I'm having the baby.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:00.869
Maybe I'll go, uh,
check on those cattle.

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:05.037
Okay, sure.

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:07.206
I'll go with you.

01:18:07.282 --> 01:18:09.807
Uh, maybe I'll wait
a little bit.

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:13.654
Okay.

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:15.485
Yeah, I'll wait.

01:18:15.557 --> 01:18:18.492
It ain't your firstborn
you're worrying about.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.051
Now quit it.
You're making the boss crazy.

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:27.631
It's gotten
awfully quiet in there.

01:18:46.021 --> 01:18:49.479
- It's a boy!
- [Cheering]

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:52.493
Willie.

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:56.925
Come and meet your son.

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:26.356
We never did get around
to deciding what to name him.

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:29.226
I was thinking...

01:19:29.297 --> 01:19:31.231
"Matthew."

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:33.290
After your brother.

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:38.031
Matthew Isaiah LaHaye.

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:42.843
Mattie.

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:47.081
It fits.

01:19:55.891 --> 01:19:58.018
Shoo. Shoo.

01:19:58.093 --> 01:20:00.152
She needs her rest.

Who knows what
the next year will bring.

in the words...

01:22:35.483 --> 01:22:37.815
"For everything,
there is a season...

01:22:37.886 --> 01:22:41.754
and a time for
every matter under heaven. '"
