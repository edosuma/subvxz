<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> two and a half men...

00:02.937 --> 00:04.403
There is something I...

00:04.405 --> 00:06.805
Probably should've told you
before we slept together.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.307
Oh, god. Husband
or herpes?

00:08.309 --> 00:10.476
For the first 40
years of my life,

00:10.478 --> 00:13.512
I was a man named paul.

00:14.948 --> 00:17.950
Wow.
(chuckles)

00:17.952 --> 00:20.285
Um...
You don't look...

00:20.287 --> 00:22.354
40.
Oh...

00:27.861 --> 00:30.129
I love christmas
in malibu.

00:30.131 --> 00:33.899
I just saw santa claus
smoking a joint on the beach.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.167
No, that's just crazy don.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.236
He's a homeless guy with a beard
who asks girls

00:37.238 --> 00:39.805
To sit on his lap and try
to find the north pole.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.907
Berta:
This came for you.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.176
I'm pretty sure it's from jake.

00:44.178 --> 00:48.514
He spelled "malibu"
m-a-l-I-b-o-o.

00:48.516 --> 00:49.448
Oh. No,

00:49.450 --> 00:51.917
Actually, it's "maliboobs."

00:51.919 --> 00:54.453
He put little nipples
on the o's.
(laughs)

00:54.455 --> 00:57.289
I just can't get used to
christmas without him.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.690
It's just
not the same.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.093
Remember how he used to
screw up christmas carols?

01:01.095 --> 01:03.095
♪ shark named harold

01:03.097 --> 01:04.830
All:
♪ could not sing

01:04.832 --> 01:08.767
♪ let's all go to burger king

01:10.904 --> 01:12.571
Oh, look. He
sent a note.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.540
Oh. Here we go. Uh...
Oh...

01:14.542 --> 01:16.875
"hey, guys. Uh, sorry
I can't be there.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.011
"I am having a
lot of fun in japan.
"in japan."

01:19.013 --> 01:21.280
"uh, christmas is
very commercial here.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.615
"sometimes I think
they don't even remember

01:23.617 --> 01:25.284
"it's santa's birthday.

01:26.853 --> 01:29.888
I hope you enjoy this little
homemade holiday treat." oh.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.290
Aw, maybe he baked us cookies.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.624
Mmm.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.727
Oh, dear lord, it's sushi.
Oh!

01:35.729 --> 01:37.329
Oh, man.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.598
Well, at least he tried.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.067
He packed 'em in ice.
(coughs)

01:42.069 --> 01:44.736
Well, it's better than the time
he sent us those easter eggs.

01:44.738 --> 01:48.640
Alan:
Mmm.
And that poor, poor bunny.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.046
Looks like, uh,
jenny's christmas present

01:54.048 --> 01:55.380
Got here early.
Mm-hmm.

01:55.382 --> 01:57.216
And from the sounds
of it last night,

01:57.218 --> 02:00.085
It's a scream my name elmo.
Jenny:
Hey,

02:00.087 --> 02:01.487
Guys, this is brooke.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.355
Um, brooke, this
is my uncle alan,

02:03.357 --> 02:05.023
And this is walden.

02:05.025 --> 02:07.960
Walden runs the
alan sanctuary.

02:07.962 --> 02:09.194
Hi.

02:09.196 --> 02:10.362
Hi. Nice to meet you.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.197
Where did, uh,
you two meet?

02:12.199 --> 02:13.465
At my work.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.733
Oh, and, uh,
what do you do?

02:14.735 --> 02:16.068
I'm an esthetician.

02:16.070 --> 02:18.537
Ooh, an esthetician.
Very impressive.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.572
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

02:20.574 --> 02:22.574
No.
Zero.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.109
How do I put this?

02:24.111 --> 02:26.011
Do you guys like
hairless vaginas?

02:26.013 --> 02:27.679
Aw, yeah.
Yeah.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.214
Okay, there you go.
That's what I do.

02:29.216 --> 02:33.085
You know, waxing, tweezing,
threading and plucking.

02:33.087 --> 02:35.921
She plucked the hell
out of me last night.

02:35.923 --> 02:39.591
Ooh, and brought a whole
new meaning to "ho, ho, ho."

02:40.894 --> 02:42.895
Listen, you want to go
get some breakfast?

02:42.897 --> 02:44.630
Nah, I got to bounce.
Thanks again.

02:44.632 --> 02:45.697
See you.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.904
(door shuts)
did I just get blown off?

02:51.906 --> 02:54.006
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Big-time.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.474
Well, no biggie.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.744
I'll just go back
to plucking myself.

02:59.712 --> 03:01.046
I feel bad for her.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.782
Do you remember the first time
you were rejected by a woman?

03:03.784 --> 03:06.385
Yeah. When the maternity
nurse handed me to my mom.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.455
♪ men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men ♪

03:10.457 --> 03:13.859
♪ ah.
♪ men.
♪ men.

03:16.896 --> 03:18.430
(commentator speaking over tv)

03:18.432 --> 03:20.699
Care for some mulled cider,
mull-lady?

03:20.701 --> 03:23.101
Oh... Thanks,

03:23.103 --> 03:24.570
But I can't.
I take hormones,

03:24.572 --> 03:27.172
And the acid in the
cider makes my beard grow.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.640
(groans)

03:28.642 --> 03:29.975
God, you are so lucky.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.878
I wish I could grow a beard.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.880
Oh. Look what else I have,
hmm?

03:34.882 --> 03:36.882
A, uh, sprig of mistletoe.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.951
Okay, great. Game's
in overtime.

03:38.953 --> 03:41.019
Mwah. Come on!

03:46.226 --> 03:50.796
(groans)
I had the craziest day
at the mall today.

03:50.798 --> 03:53.365
You heard me
about the overtime, right?

03:53.367 --> 03:55.701
You heard me
about the mall, right?

03:55.703 --> 03:57.836
Darn it.
(groans)

04:03.443 --> 04:05.310
Is everything okay
down there?

04:05.312 --> 04:07.579
Oh. (chuckles)
my bad.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.581
I got phantom nuts.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.217
Hmm...

04:12.219 --> 04:13.952
You can scratch mine
if you want.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.721
Woman:
Hey, paula,

04:15.723 --> 04:17.589
I'm just...
Oh, sorry.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.991
I didn't realize
you had company.

04:18.993 --> 04:20.993
No, no. Come on in. Uh...

04:20.995 --> 04:22.661
Rachel, this is alan.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.162
Alan, this is my ex-wife.

04:24.164 --> 04:26.098
Oh. I, uh... I didn't know
you were married.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.600
Uh, then again, I didn't know
you had a penis, so...

04:28.602 --> 04:30.669
She lost them both
at about the same time.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.137
Nice to meet you, alan.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.906
Oh. You, too. It's really great
that you guys are still friends.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.609
Yeah. And thankfully
the same shoe size.
Oh.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.411
By the way, those silver
platforms that you lent me

04:39.413 --> 04:40.846
Really did a number on my back.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.447
Oh, I'm sorry.
But you're in luck.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.816
Alan here is one of
the top chiropractors

04:44.818 --> 04:48.086
In los angeles.
Well, I was named, uh,

04:48.088 --> 04:49.821
One of the "top chiropractors
to watch"

04:49.823 --> 04:52.357
By the personal injury lawyer
trade association.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.092
Paula:
Yeah, he's just

04:54.094 --> 04:55.694
Being modest.
Last night,

04:55.696 --> 04:58.864
He threw my back out.
This morning, fixed it.

04:58.866 --> 05:01.667
Oh...
(chuckles)

05:01.669 --> 05:04.036
Well, maybe I can come
by your office.

05:04.038 --> 05:05.704
Oh, well, uh, I-I
closed my office.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.773
Uh, I'm actually
semi-retired.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.608
Uh, I-I do philanthropic work

05:09.610 --> 05:11.476
Out in malibu with
a billionaire.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.512
We, uh... We run
a sanctuary.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.613
What kind?

05:14.615 --> 05:16.415
Uh, you know,
the homeless,

05:16.417 --> 05:19.885
Unemployed middle-aged men,
lesbian alcoholics, the usual.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.420
That's nice.
Mm-hmm.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.089
Well, um, maybe
you'd make a house call

05:24.091 --> 05:25.590
If that's not too weird?

05:25.592 --> 05:28.160
No weirder than
me dating a dude.
(chuckles)

05:30.997 --> 05:33.665
Oh. Somebody's been
sneaking the cider.
What?

05:33.667 --> 05:36.735
What? Really?
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

05:40.306 --> 05:42.040
Hey.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.942
Hey.

05:46.312 --> 05:49.948
Looks like someone's celebrating
the 12 steps of christmas.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.951
Yeah, well, I've had
a tough morning.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.553
You want to
talk about it?

05:54.555 --> 05:55.854
Let's rap.

05:56.889 --> 05:59.624
"rap"?

05:59.626 --> 06:02.894
You're like the creepy guidance
counselor I had in high school.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.231
"tell me all
about your lesbian experiences.

06:06.233 --> 06:09.568
I can't help you
unless I know every detail."

06:09.570 --> 06:11.603
God, I hated her.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.673
She was good in bed, though.

06:14.675 --> 06:17.008
Really? Tell me about it.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.611
I can't help you unless
I know every detail.

06:21.848 --> 06:24.082
Oh, come on. You're
a relationship guy, right?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.884
I don't know. I mean,
I-I do believe

06:25.886 --> 06:27.819
There is someone out
there for everyone.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.756
I'm just terrified that
my someone is alan.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.891
So... (clears throat)
how do you know

06:32.893 --> 06:35.894
When you want to be
in a relationship?

06:35.896 --> 06:37.763
The first sign is that
you start asking people,

06:37.765 --> 06:41.199
"how do you know when you
want to be in a relationship?"

06:41.201 --> 06:42.534
Oh, god.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.736
Sick of plucking
yourself already?

06:46.072 --> 06:48.373
Is it the, uh, girl
from yesterday?

06:48.375 --> 06:50.375
Yeah.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.444
Brooke.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.279
Why don't you just call her?

06:54.281 --> 06:57.349
No. No. I'm the girl
that gets called.

06:57.351 --> 06:59.451
I don't do the calling.

06:59.453 --> 07:02.654
Oh, my god, she gave you
a fake number.

07:02.656 --> 07:06.958
It's possible she lives in the
back of a mexican restaurant.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.294
Hey, look,
if you really like this girl,

07:09.296 --> 07:11.963
Look her up on facebook
and send her a message.

07:11.965 --> 07:15.801
Oh, or... Send her a picture
of your boobs.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.669
That's desperate.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.605
Besides, she already
has a picture of my boobs.

07:20.607 --> 07:24.643
Or the busboy in the back of
the mexican restaurant has it.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.645
All right, look.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.980
Sometimes in life

07:28.982 --> 07:30.916
You have to take a risk

07:30.918 --> 07:32.918
And put yourself out there.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.719
Sometimes it doesn't work.

07:34.721 --> 07:37.489
But sometimes it does.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.391
And sometimes

07:39.393 --> 07:41.993
It works so well that you
end up proposing to them

07:41.995 --> 07:43.462
And they say no

07:43.464 --> 07:47.332
And all you're left with
is a custom designed ring

07:47.334 --> 07:51.403
That you can't return whose
very existence mocks you.

07:52.772 --> 07:55.373
(exhales)

07:56.342 --> 07:57.976
You want to rap about it?

07:57.978 --> 08:00.045
Shut up!

08:01.547 --> 08:03.482
I will have this set up
in a sec.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.985
(loud cracking)
oh! My back.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.620
Oh, my god, are you okay?

08:08.622 --> 08:10.222
(cracking)
(chuckles)

08:10.224 --> 08:11.957
Little chiropractor humor.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.559
I call it "cracking you up."

08:14.561 --> 08:16.962
Hop on up.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.397
How long have you and paula
been dating?

08:19.399 --> 08:20.732
Oh, just a-a couple
of weeks.

08:20.734 --> 08:24.002
You know, still holding hands,
running the water while I pee.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.071
How long were you
and paul together?

08:26.073 --> 08:27.472
20 years.

08:27.474 --> 08:31.142
Wow. That's pooping
while the other one showers.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.545
Uh, so, uh, paul's change

08:33.547 --> 08:35.780
Must have been
a big adjustment for you.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.949
Oh, I was pretty
angry at first.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.685
When he said he wanted to become
a woman, I grabbed a knife

08:40.687 --> 08:43.588
From the kitchen and offered
to do the surgery myself.

08:43.590 --> 08:44.589
Woop!
(chuckles)

08:44.591 --> 08:46.458
Baggage just stowed for takeoff.

08:46.460 --> 08:49.928
Um, at least the two of you are
in a healthy place now.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.596
Oh, it's not easy.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.798
Can you imagine
how annoying it is

08:53.800 --> 08:55.333
That she's a better-looking
woman than I am?

08:55.335 --> 08:57.068
And the boobs, by the way,

08:57.070 --> 08:58.503
Exact copies of mine.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.372
Well, I think
you're both very beautiful,

09:00.374 --> 09:03.542
And, uh...
And kudos on the boobs.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.944
Would you mind working
a little lower?

09:05.946 --> 09:07.212
Oh, sure. Let's, uh...

09:07.214 --> 09:08.880
Let's narrow it down
to the lumbar region.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.483
Uh, where does it hurt?
Uh, l5? L4?

09:11.485 --> 09:12.817
Lower.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.153
Okay, we're into
the-the sacral region.

09:15.155 --> 09:18.290
Uh, that's s2. S3?

09:18.292 --> 09:20.559
A-a little lower.

09:20.561 --> 09:21.726
Okay.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.462
Uh, I believe
we are out of the s's

09:24.464 --> 09:26.865
And into the asses.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.466
How does that feel?

09:28.468 --> 09:31.202
Uh, like the tension
has moved out of your back

09:31.204 --> 09:33.305
And into my pants.

09:33.307 --> 09:35.240
I'm sure
this is wildly inappropriate,

09:35.242 --> 09:37.375
But I'm very attracted to you.

09:37.377 --> 09:40.045
Well, I'm-I'm flattered.
Uh-uh, it's just that...

09:40.047 --> 09:42.113
I'm dating your ex-husband.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.251
Boy, that was a weird thing
to hear yourself say.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.219
I understand.

09:48.221 --> 09:51.289
Let me know if you
change your mind.

09:52.358 --> 09:55.226
You do realize your hand
is still on my ass.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.128
I do.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.630
Still there.

09:58.632 --> 10:01.700
I'm just glad you don't know
where my other hand is.

10:05.304 --> 10:08.239
Hi. So, I have you down for

10:08.241 --> 10:10.442
The total bro-zilian wax.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.911
Yeah, I wasn't really sure
which one to choose.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.913
It was either that
or the butt reynolds.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.514
Wait, don't I know you?

10:16.516 --> 10:18.683
Yeah, I'm walden.

10:18.685 --> 10:21.419
Hang on. Did you chase me out
of your house the other day

10:21.421 --> 10:24.789
For banging your wife?
'cause she came on to me.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.125
No, uh, you hooked up
with my friend jenny.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.593
Uh, we live in malibu.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.262
Oh, yeah, yeah, jenny.
Yeah, she was a lot of fun.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.864
Oh-oh, god,
does she have herpes?

10:32.866 --> 10:34.199
Is that why you're here?

10:34.201 --> 10:36.801
(chuckles)
no, that is not why I'm here.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.937
Actually, I wanted
to see if you...

10:38.939 --> 10:40.005
Ow!

10:40.007 --> 10:42.440
Oh!

10:42.442 --> 10:43.642
(panting)

10:43.644 --> 10:45.143
Okay. Oh, my god.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.645
How 'bout a little
heads-up next time?

10:46.647 --> 10:47.445
Okay, heads-up.

10:47.447 --> 10:51.383
Hey!
(panting)

10:51.385 --> 10:54.486
So, why are you here?

10:54.488 --> 10:56.087
Uh, well... (laughs)

10:56.089 --> 10:58.590
Well, um, my-my
friend jenny--

10:58.592 --> 11:00.458
She thinks that
you're really cool.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.093
And this is
kind of awkward.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.762
I don't really know
how to say this.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.397
Take her out again!

11:05.399 --> 11:07.265
Yeah, I don't know.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.367
I mean, I like
to keep it casual.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.769
Lesbians get too attached,

11:10.771 --> 11:14.806
And then somebody always
ends up screaming or crying.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.541
(screams, crying)

11:16.543 --> 11:18.376
I get that.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.578
Um, uh, but
here's the thing.

11:20.580 --> 11:21.780
Like,

11:21.782 --> 11:23.381
Jenny's really awesome,

11:23.383 --> 11:25.350
And I think
if you took a chance

11:25.352 --> 11:28.086
To get to know her
that you would really like her.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.921
Yeah? I don't know.
Turn over.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.723
What?

11:31.725 --> 11:32.824
All fours, butt up.

11:33.926 --> 11:35.960
Oh. This...

11:35.962 --> 11:40.799
This reminds me of a horrible
prison nightmare I once had.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.904
You know, I got to say,
if you're willing

11:45.906 --> 11:48.273
To go through all
of this for your friend,

11:48.275 --> 11:50.075
She must be all right, huh?

11:50.077 --> 11:51.643
Yeah.
I'll give her a call.

11:51.645 --> 11:53.845
(sighs)
okay.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.013
This one's gonna hurt.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.915
This one?

11:56.917 --> 11:59.050
(shouting):
Mommy!

12:22.942 --> 12:24.743
(sighs)

12:24.745 --> 12:25.810
Whoa.

12:27.513 --> 12:30.181
Some might say
that a guy who does this

12:30.183 --> 12:32.917
Out in the open wants
his housekeeper to catch him.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.087
No, I-I... (sighs)

12:38.190 --> 12:41.559
Oh, hey, johnson and johnson.

12:41.561 --> 12:42.761
And johnson.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.829
(laughs)

12:48.000 --> 12:50.034
Oh.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.403
(laughs)

12:52.405 --> 12:54.305
Hold on.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.174
Weren't you the one
that called the house meeting

12:56.176 --> 12:57.642
About no more masturbating
in the kitchen?

12:57.644 --> 13:00.044
No, I... I, uh...

13:00.046 --> 13:02.447
I got groomed.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.882
Actually,

13:03.884 --> 13:06.684
I went down to brooke's salon...

13:06.686 --> 13:09.120
And asked her if she would
go out with you again.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.488
Are you insane?!

13:10.490 --> 13:12.824
What, you think
I can't get my own dates?

13:12.826 --> 13:14.359
Do I look like a child?

13:14.361 --> 13:17.562
No, but thanks to brooke, I do.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.533
And thanks to me,

13:21.535 --> 13:23.835
She wants to go out
with you again.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.904
She wants to go out
with me again?

13:25.906 --> 13:27.071
What did she say?

13:27.073 --> 13:29.207
You want to rap about it?

13:30.643 --> 13:34.312
She said that she would call you
in a few days,

13:34.314 --> 13:37.315
And that my balls
would stop burning by tomorrow.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.683
Or wait.

13:38.685 --> 13:41.386
Was it that she would call you
tomorrow,

13:41.388 --> 13:44.189
And my balls would stop burning
in a few days?

13:44.191 --> 13:46.191
Let me know when she calls.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.492
Okay?

13:47.494 --> 13:50.161
Thank you. Thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.464
You are welcome
from the bottom of my scrotum.

13:56.402 --> 13:57.602
(panting)

13:57.604 --> 13:58.903
Wow. That was amazing.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.271
(both laugh)

14:00.273 --> 14:01.539
I got to tell you.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.408
The guy who built your hoo-hah
is an artist.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.676
Aw.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.845
He's like van gogh,
but instead of cutting off ears,

14:06.847 --> 14:08.980
He's cutting off...
Well, you know.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.082
(sighing)

14:11.084 --> 14:12.917
Hey.
What?

14:12.919 --> 14:14.752
Can we talk about us?

14:14.754 --> 14:17.088
Oh, god, can't I...
Can't I just buy you something?

14:17.090 --> 14:19.224
Well, gifts are
always welcome,

14:19.226 --> 14:23.661
But, uh, I was just wondering
if we were exclusive.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.597
Okay, look, alan...

14:25.599 --> 14:26.931
(panting)

14:26.933 --> 14:30.101
...I like you, but I always...
I always promised myself

14:30.103 --> 14:33.004
That if I had the courage
to become a real woman,

14:33.006 --> 14:35.006
That that woman...

14:35.008 --> 14:37.041
Would be a total slut.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.544
Okay, so-so...
So, just to clarify...

14:39.546 --> 14:40.612
Mm-hmm.

14:40.614 --> 14:43.448
...You... Or me are free

14:43.450 --> 14:45.783
To date anybody else,
anybody in the world?

14:45.785 --> 14:47.085
Yes.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.853
Okay, if that's what you want.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.922
(laughs)

14:58.731 --> 15:01.132
Oh, hey, you look great.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.567
No, I don't.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.502
I've tried on, like,
a hundred outfits.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.671
Butch, femme, lipstick, pixie.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.539
There was even a dark moment

15:08.541 --> 15:10.909
Where I was wearing
one of alan's polos.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.911
Oh, actually,
they're called "polas."

15:12.913 --> 15:15.680
He buys them at a gas station.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.815
If you look close,
the guy's not playing polo.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.684
It's a gardener riding a donkey.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.453
I'm a nervous wreck.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.455
Oh, come on.
You're going to be fine.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.291
Just be yourself.
Right.

15:26.293 --> 15:29.894
Right. Right,
just be myself.

15:29.896 --> 15:32.130
W.W.J.D.?

15:32.132 --> 15:35.700
What would jenny drink?

15:35.702 --> 15:38.303
I don't think
that alcohol is the answer.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.872
Well, clearly,
you don't know the question.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.810
On vodka, on soda,

15:45.812 --> 15:48.680
On blender, on mixer!

15:48.682 --> 15:51.449
Okay, I'm just gonna go back
to blowing myself.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.791
So, uh, did you ask santa
for anything special this year?

15:59.793 --> 16:02.727
Oh, just someone
to stuff my stocking.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.196
Oh. Someone's on
the naughty list.

16:05.198 --> 16:08.866
Well, I hope that won't keep me
from getting a nice big package.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.868
Oh, don't you worry.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.905
I'm sure santa's got something
in his sack for you.

16:13.907 --> 16:16.140
Ooh, look
who's on the naughty list now.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.308
(laughs)

16:17.310 --> 16:18.576
But you have to be careful

16:18.578 --> 16:20.111
About shipping rates
around the holidays.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.847
You could pay extra
for a package that's oversized

16:22.849 --> 16:25.283
Or an irregular shape.

16:27.086 --> 16:29.287
Rachel?

16:29.289 --> 16:31.289
Paula?

16:31.291 --> 16:33.491
Alan? What's going on here?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.727
Uh, well, this is a...
An awkward coincidence.

16:35.729 --> 16:38.262
It's not a coincidence.
I come here every Friday night,

16:38.264 --> 16:40.231
And she knows it.
Oh, this is completely innocent.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.734
Oh, please. You're wearing
my screw-me pumps!

16:42.736 --> 16:45.236
That's funny.
Uh, I have a screw-me pump, too.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.373
I only need it
when I'm drinking too much.

16:49.808 --> 16:52.143
All the women in the world,
and you have to pick my ex-wife?

16:52.145 --> 16:54.712
Uh, first of all,
I don't actually get to pick.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.048
I'm more of a
take-what-comes kind of guy.

16:57.050 --> 16:59.150
Besides, you said
we weren't exclusive.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.152
Oh.
Yeah, he can date
whoever he wants.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.254
Okay, you only brought him here
to make me jealous.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.589
Oh, please. Don't
flatter yourself.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.891
Okay, let's all...
Let's just calm down here.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.793
Hey, I see it now.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.294
You guys do have the same boobs.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.868
Jenny?

17:16.870 --> 17:18.870
Are you okay?

17:18.872 --> 17:20.938
I'll be right there.

17:22.975 --> 17:25.676
Can you knock again
so I can find the door?

17:25.678 --> 17:27.178
Okay, I'm coming in.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.780
Hey.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.048
Hey, walden!

17:30.050 --> 17:31.382
Are you drunk?

17:31.384 --> 17:34.585
No, I only had one drink.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.788
Okay, I went to a lot
of trouble for you,

17:36.790 --> 17:39.190
And you are going
on this date.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.125
Why do you care so much?

17:41.127 --> 17:43.227
Well, I can give you
a bro-zilian reasons why.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.629
Now, come on.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.231
Let's get you
sobered up.
Okay, let me just use

17:47.233 --> 17:48.833
The bathroom
real quick.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.536
Jenny?

17:51.538 --> 17:53.304
That's not the bathroom.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.440
Too late.

17:56.675 --> 17:58.042
How could you do this to me?

17:58.044 --> 18:01.179
It hurts losing the man of
your dreams, doesn't it?

18:01.181 --> 18:03.147
Please. Alan is not
the man of my dreams.

18:03.149 --> 18:04.816
He's just the only guy
who didn't think

18:04.818 --> 18:06.851
An inside-out wiener
was a deal breaker.

18:06.853 --> 18:11.155
I've also been told
I have nice eyes, but okay.

18:11.157 --> 18:14.292
Well, you <i>were</i> the
man of my dreams.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.327
Don't you see
what's going on here?

18:16.329 --> 18:18.162
You still care for her,

18:18.164 --> 18:20.264
And you're just trying
to make her jealous

18:20.266 --> 18:22.500
By dating a sexy, handsome,
well-endowed man.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.837
I do still have feelings
for you.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.505
And you still have feelings
for her,

18:27.507 --> 18:30.174
Despite taking a lover whose
charm and wit is only matched

18:30.176 --> 18:32.143
By his unbridled passion
in the boudoir.

18:32.145 --> 18:35.179
I do miss you.

18:35.181 --> 18:36.881
I miss you, too.

18:38.083 --> 18:40.384
Oh, how nice is this?

18:40.386 --> 18:41.686
You two should kiss.

18:41.688 --> 18:44.589
Come here.

18:46.091 --> 18:48.759
You two are probably gonna want
a picture of this.

18:53.732 --> 18:56.434
Let's get some
coffee in you.

18:56.436 --> 19:01.272
Okay, I'll have
a half-caff zach braff.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.276
(snoring)
oh.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.444
Perfect.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.613
(doorbell rings,
walden scoffs)

19:08.615 --> 19:10.715
It's a tale as old as time.

19:10.717 --> 19:14.285
Don't wax your ass to help
your roommate's lesbian niece.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.188
Hey, waldo!

19:18.357 --> 19:21.225
Hi, baldo.

19:23.295 --> 19:24.829
Brooke, are you drunk?

19:24.831 --> 19:27.532
No, I'm merloaded.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.600
You drank
that whole bottle yourself?

19:29.602 --> 19:33.204
It's okay. I'm gonna
eat later. Shh.

19:35.774 --> 19:37.341
Come on.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.944
I'm sorry.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.747
I never do second dates,

19:42.749 --> 19:45.349
And I was nervous
'cause I really like jenny.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.552
Hello. Hey, there's jenny!

19:47.554 --> 19:49.720
Okay, nap date.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.722
Uh, good idea. Mm.

19:54.059 --> 19:56.060
How cute.

19:56.062 --> 19:59.330
It's like two drunk,
gay puppies.

20:01.633 --> 20:04.769
Ah. They're gonna want
a picture of this later.

<i>'twas the night</i>
<i>before christmas</i>

20:19.852 --> 20:23.588
<i>When all down the beach</i>
<i>not a creature was stirring,</i>

20:23.590 --> 20:26.023
<i>Not even a leech.</i>

20:26.025 --> 20:28.859
<i>Alan was nestled,</i>
<i>all snug in his bed,</i>

20:28.861 --> 20:32.697
<i>While visions of lesbians</i>

20:32.699 --> 20:36.701
Brooke and jenny were sleeping,
<i>a long winter's nap,</i>

20:36.703 --> 20:39.837
<i>Surrounded by bottles</i>
<i>with nary a cap.</i>

20:39.839 --> 20:41.739
<i>Jenny was nervous</i>
<i>and frightened,</i>

20:41.741 --> 20:43.908
<i>But took a big chance.</i>

20:43.910 --> 20:48.179
<i>She let brooke in her heart,</i>
<i>as well as her pants.</i>

20:48.181 --> 20:51.549
<i>While berta in her vest</i>
<i>and I in my hattie</i>

20:51.551 --> 20:53.851
<i>Had just baked our brains out</i>

20:53.853 --> 20:56.921
<i>With a big christmas fatty.</i>

20:56.923 --> 21:00.758
<i>We started to doze,</i>
<i>we hadn't a care.</i>

21:00.760 --> 21:04.262
<i>Happy christmas to all.</i>
<i>My balls have no hair.</i>
