00:00.471 --> 00:01.505
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.528 --> 00:07.063
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.131 --> 00:09.499
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.567 --> 00:12.068
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.136 --> 00:14.404
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.472 --> 00:16.573
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.640 --> 00:19.809
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.877 --> 00:22.445
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.513 --> 00:24.047
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.115 --> 00:25.682
Should we shoot them?

00:25.750 --> 00:28.251
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.319 --> 00:30.653
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.721 --> 00:33.123
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.190 --> 00:35.358
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.426 --> 00:37.861
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:37.928 --> 00:39.529
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:45.702 --> 00:46.825
<i>For spies,</i>

00:46.826 --> 00:49.427
<i>top-secret clearance</i>
<i>is just the beginning.</i>

00:49.495 --> 00:51.429
<i>S.C.I. --</i>
<i>The right to view</i>

00:51.497 --> 00:53.365
<i>sensitive compartmentalized</i>
<i>information --</i>

00:53.432 --> 00:55.066
<i>is reserved</i>

00:55.134 --> 00:58.236
<i>for the most trusted people</i>
<i>in the intelligence community.</i>

00:58.304 --> 01:00.572
That kind of access
comes with fewer constraints,

01:00.640 --> 01:02.073
<i>limited oversight,</i>

01:02.141 --> 01:05.343
<i>and a frightening ability</i>
<i>to do real harm.</i>

01:12.485 --> 01:15.053
I'm getting a little jealous
of that badge.

01:15.121 --> 01:18.523
I remember when you couldn't
keep your hands off me.

01:18.591 --> 01:20.892
I've waited years to see my name
on this again.

01:20.960 --> 01:22.694
Now that it finally is...

01:22.762 --> 01:25.730
A psychopath blackmails you
into using it

01:25.798 --> 01:28.667
to destroy files
in the CIA's computer system.

01:28.734 --> 01:31.403
And when I do this,

01:31.470 --> 01:34.806
Anson Fullerton
goes back to being a ghost.

01:34.874 --> 01:36.808
I don't want you doing anything
for that man.

01:36.876 --> 01:38.677
If I don't do this, Fi,
you'll spend

01:38.744 --> 01:41.580
the rest of your life in jail
for something you didn't do.

01:41.647 --> 01:44.816
You think he's just gonna hand
over the evidence he has on me?

01:44.884 --> 01:46.251
He'll keep forcing you
to do his bidding.

01:46.319 --> 01:49.154
There is no end to this.
That is a possibility,

01:49.222 --> 01:51.456
but right now,
I don't have much choice.

01:51.524 --> 01:54.059
Well, I'm not willing
to throw in the towel yet.

01:54.126 --> 01:56.995
Can you call Anson,
tell him you need to meet?

01:57.063 --> 01:58.330
For what?

01:58.397 --> 02:00.966
Make up a reason.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.801
But if you can get him
away from his car,

02:02.869 --> 02:04.970
Sam and I can plant
this tracker.

02:05.037 --> 02:07.405
We can follow the rat
back to his nest.

02:07.473 --> 02:10.208
Anson's not gonna hide blackmail
material under his pillow.

02:10.276 --> 02:11.776
Well, maybe we get lucky
and he does.

02:11.844 --> 02:13.311
It's too risky
for a "maybe."

02:13.379 --> 02:14.746
It's even riskier
to do nothing.

02:14.814 --> 02:16.815
We can't win
if we don't play.

02:20.086 --> 02:22.454
18 bucks for a mojito?

02:22.521 --> 02:24.623
What kind of a tourist trap
is this?

02:24.690 --> 02:27.259
A tourist trap with a good view
of Michael's meeting place.

02:27.326 --> 02:29.461
You're wishing that
was a sniper rifle, aren't you?

02:29.528 --> 02:31.897
Can you think of anyone

02:31.964 --> 02:34.366
who deserves a bullet
more than that soulless bastard?

02:34.433 --> 02:36.701
Well, for now, let's just stick
to finding out where he lives.

02:36.769 --> 02:39.404
Okay, here he comes.

02:39.472 --> 02:41.473
Break a leg, Fi.

02:43.476 --> 02:46.611
Michael,
you look tired.

02:46.679 --> 02:50.148
Laboring on my behalf,
I presume?

02:50.216 --> 02:52.117
We better walk and talk.
Can I buy you a lemonade?

02:58.824 --> 03:00.392
You haven't answered
my question.

03:00.459 --> 03:01.893
There's a little delay.

03:01.961 --> 03:03.194
A delay?

03:03.262 --> 03:04.496
You have official access

03:04.563 --> 03:06.932
and the tools
to erase my name from that file.

03:06.999 --> 03:09.434
- Why isn't it done?
- Clearance is being held up.

03:09.502 --> 03:11.236
- It shouldn't be long, but --
- No.

03:11.304 --> 03:12.504
What do you mean, "no"?

03:12.571 --> 03:15.140
There's a great sentence
in your psych eval.

03:15.207 --> 03:18.743
It says, "Westen is particularly
skilled at social engineering,

03:18.811 --> 03:20.745
"creating rapport
with targets

03:20.813 --> 03:22.914
and steering them
towards an objective."

03:22.982 --> 03:24.716
I know your moves
better than you do.

03:24.784 --> 03:26.151
I don't know
what you're planning,

03:26.218 --> 03:28.086
but I'm not
going to fall for it.

03:32.858 --> 03:35.727
I can't see them.
Am I clear?

03:36.929 --> 03:39.331
We're good. Mike walked
Anson out to the dunes, so...

03:39.398 --> 03:41.833
Yeah, go for it.

03:41.901 --> 03:43.668
Friday.

03:43.736 --> 03:45.904
Have my name erased
from those files by Friday,

03:45.972 --> 03:48.173
or Fiona gets used
to taking group showers.

03:53.379 --> 03:55.313
Hang on, Fi. He's turned around.
Get out of there.

03:55.381 --> 03:56.815
No. There's still
a way to do this.

04:02.688 --> 04:03.998
He's headed to the bridge.

04:04.023 --> 04:05.383
He's gonna have to cross
the light at Collins.

04:05.391 --> 04:06.558
I'll catch him there.

Anson's not stuck in traffic.
He's making another stop.

05:19.822 --> 05:20.611
All right. Good.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.480
Show us where you live, doc.
Come on.

05:25.150 --> 05:28.319
No.

05:28.387 --> 05:30.221
Looks like he's
just going to the dentist.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.223
Well, Sam and Fi are on his ass.
He's bound to go home at some point.

05:32.291 --> 05:33.557
Just relax.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.661
Hey, Maddy.

05:36.728 --> 05:39.397
Hey, ma.
What are you doing here?

05:46.638 --> 05:48.906
I couldn't do this
on the phone.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.441
Do what?
What is it?

05:50.509 --> 05:53.577
It's Andre.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.780
He was shot.

05:55.847 --> 05:57.748
He's dead, Michael.

05:57.816 --> 05:58.716
What?

06:00.519 --> 06:02.453
When?

06:02.521 --> 06:04.155
Last night.

06:04.222 --> 06:05.523
Who's Andre?

06:05.590 --> 06:07.591
He was my best friend
since childhood.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.260
Aw, Jesus.

06:10.962 --> 06:13.331
How's Ricky?

06:13.398 --> 06:15.533
His brother's dead.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.735
He sounded like
he was in shock.

06:17.803 --> 06:20.604
He wanted to know if --
if you would come by.

06:34.086 --> 06:37.188
You boys looked so sweet
back then.

06:37.255 --> 06:39.990
It's easy to forget what little
hell-raisers you could be.

06:40.058 --> 06:42.226
You know, growing up,

06:42.294 --> 06:44.995
Andre always thought
of you two as family.

06:45.063 --> 06:48.766
I am so sorry, Ricky.

06:48.834 --> 06:51.802
I thought
he was still in jail.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.170
When did he get out?

06:53.238 --> 06:54.605
Eight months ago.

06:54.673 --> 06:56.674
He kept saying
he was gonna call you,

06:56.742 --> 06:58.876
but I guess he...
- He never got around to it.

06:58.944 --> 07:01.445
It's okay. We hadn't talked
in a long time.

07:01.513 --> 07:03.881
I know you two
had your differences,

07:03.949 --> 07:05.449
but you'd have been
surprised.

07:05.517 --> 07:07.151
Andre turned his life
around.

07:07.219 --> 07:08.652
I'm really glad
to hear that.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.888
It wasn't a hollow promise
this time.

07:10.956 --> 07:13.357
I mean, he -- he was working
in the community,

07:13.425 --> 07:14.759
trying to make
a difference.

07:14.826 --> 07:19.230
All he wanted to do
was make his little girls proud.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.033
Do the cops know
who did this?

07:23.101 --> 07:26.103
Honestly?
They don't care.

07:26.171 --> 07:30.074
They just figure Andre
got back in the game and...

07:30.142 --> 07:32.009
Got killed for it.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.445
But I know
that is not true.

07:34.513 --> 07:36.447
Andre made some mistakes,

07:36.515 --> 07:38.749
but I've always known
he had a good heart.

07:38.817 --> 07:42.353
You should eat something,
honey.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.755
I'll make you a plate.

07:46.825 --> 07:48.426
Ricky, if there's
anything you need --

07:48.493 --> 07:51.162
anything at all --
you don't hesitate to call me.

07:52.664 --> 07:54.331
There is one thing.

07:54.399 --> 07:57.268
I need to talk to you
for a minute, uh...

07:57.335 --> 07:58.669
Outside.

08:03.675 --> 08:06.410
I found this burner
in Andre's car.

08:06.478 --> 08:09.013
He got five calls
from a blocked number yesterday.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.515
If we can figure out who made
'em, I think we find his killer.

08:11.583 --> 08:12.917
Why didn't you give this
to the police?

08:12.984 --> 08:14.185
Come on, man.

08:14.252 --> 08:16.420
Cops don't cut
their coffee breaks short

08:16.488 --> 08:18.889
to find out who called
a dead ex-con in Overtown.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.025
I have a friend
who can trace the blocked calls,

08:21.092 --> 08:23.427
but...are you sure
you want me to do this?

08:23.495 --> 08:25.329
You might not like
what we find.

08:25.397 --> 08:27.198
Now, I know you gave up on Andre
a long time ago --

08:27.265 --> 08:30.601
and I get it --
but I never did.

08:30.669 --> 08:32.403
Now, I just need to know
the truth.

08:37.609 --> 08:38.708
I'll look into it.

08:44.616 --> 08:47.685
<i>The advantage of having</i>
<i>a GPS tracker on a vehicle</i>

08:47.752 --> 08:49.386
<i>is it allows you</i>
<i>to stay close to your target</i>

08:49.454 --> 08:50.821
<i>without being seen.</i>

08:50.889 --> 08:54.124
Okay, Anson just turned left
again. He's back on Biscayne.

08:54.192 --> 08:55.493
- Again?
- Yeah.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.561
Guy's driving around in circles
like he's Pac-Man.

08:57.629 --> 08:59.029
Oh, he must be worried
about being followed.

08:59.097 --> 09:00.831
Maybe he's finally going
someplace important.

09:00.899 --> 09:01.999
Okay.
He just turned right.

09:03.502 --> 09:05.536
Okay. He stopped.

09:05.604 --> 09:08.138
4th and Elm. Fi, get there. Let's go!

09:08.206 --> 09:11.075
<i>The disadvantage a following</i>
<i>someone without visual contact</i>

09:11.142 --> 09:12.710
<i>is that</i>
<i>when they get out of their car,</i>

09:12.777 --> 09:15.279
<i>you've got to catch up</i>
<i>in a hurry or risk losing them.</i>

09:22.521 --> 09:24.822
There he is.

09:24.890 --> 09:26.156
Damn it.

09:26.224 --> 09:27.825
Dollars to doughnuts
he's heading home,

09:27.893 --> 09:29.894
but there's no way to follow him
without getting made.

09:30.962 --> 09:33.864
Well, if we get
a better vantage point,

09:33.932 --> 09:35.399
we won't
have to follow him.

09:35.467 --> 09:37.801
- Oh, Fi, no. No, no, no.
- Oh, yeah.

09:41.673 --> 09:43.073
Oh, Fi. Come on.
Slow down.

09:43.141 --> 09:44.608
You said
you wanted to go faster.

09:50.849 --> 09:52.716
Whoa, whoa.
Van. Van!

09:52.784 --> 09:54.151
Try not to distract
the driver.

10:05.664 --> 10:08.699
There he is.
3 blocks, 11:00.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.537
Now we know
where the bastard sleeps.

10:13.605 --> 10:15.205
Yeah, well,
don't spike the ball just yet.

10:15.273 --> 10:17.141
There's got to be 300 units
in that complex.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.208
We can't just knock
on every door until we find him.

10:19.268 --> 10:21.436
No...
But it's a start, Sam.

10:21.580 --> 10:24.181
<i>Whether it's espionage,</i>
<i>international gunrunning,</i>

10:24.249 --> 10:25.849
<i>or managing</i>
<i>a local street gang,</i>

10:25.917 --> 10:28.185
<i>the preferred method</i>
<i>of communication</i>

10:28.253 --> 10:30.387
<i>used by people involved</i>
<i>in illegal activity</i>

10:30.455 --> 10:31.989
<i>is the burner phone.</i>

10:32.057 --> 10:33.524
<i>Cheap and disposable,</i>

10:33.592 --> 10:36.026
<i>they can be used a few times</i>
<i>and thrown away --</i>

10:36.094 --> 10:38.362
<i>which means, if you're using</i>
<i>one to trace someone,</i>

10:38.430 --> 10:41.465
<i>you've got to move fast.</i>

10:41.533 --> 10:43.634
So, um, I had one of the techs
at my firm

10:43.702 --> 10:45.536
trace the calls
on your brother's phone

10:45.604 --> 10:46.980
to that house right there,
the white one.

10:46.981 --> 10:47.901
Did you get a name?

10:47.906 --> 10:50.040
No. No, the calls came
from another burner.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.042
Last one was
about a half-hour before...

10:52.110 --> 10:53.844
Andre was, uh...

10:53.912 --> 10:55.579
All right.

10:55.647 --> 10:57.681
- Let's go find out who he was talking to.
- Way ahead of you.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.286
Figure I'll take the front.
You take the back.

11:02.354 --> 11:04.221
You got one for me?

11:04.289 --> 11:06.256
Um...

11:06.324 --> 11:08.292
I was thinking you should
stay in the car, just kind of --

11:08.360 --> 11:11.528
Whoever's in that house either
killed my brother or set him up.

11:11.596 --> 11:12.830
You don't know that
for sure.

11:12.897 --> 11:14.632
- That's why I'm going in.
- Slow down.

11:14.699 --> 11:17.601
There's a chance whoever's
in there might know who you are.

11:17.669 --> 11:21.338
Now, you asked for my help.
Trust me and stay back.

11:23.875 --> 11:25.976
All right.
Do your thing.

11:26.044 --> 11:28.178
<i>It's a good idea</i>
<i>to keep your initial contact</i>

11:28.246 --> 11:30.014
<i>with someone</i>
<i>who might be dangerous</i>

11:30.081 --> 11:31.281
<i>non-threatening.</i>

11:31.349 --> 11:33.017
<i>You're a lot less likely</i>
<i>to get shot at.</i>

11:33.084 --> 11:34.718
Miami Gas and Electric.

11:34.786 --> 11:37.621
We got a report
of a leak in the area. Hello?!

11:41.393 --> 11:43.761
<i>Although just because</i>
<i>something's less likely</i>

11:43.828 --> 11:45.362
<i>doesn't mean</i>
<i>it never happens.</i>

12:03.715 --> 12:05.049
Get the hell off me!

12:05.116 --> 12:07.685
I don't -- I don't think so.

12:07.752 --> 12:10.020
Dolly? What the hell
are you doing here?

12:10.088 --> 12:11.092
Wait. You know her?

12:11.117 --> 12:12.533
I thought you and Andre
were friends.

12:12.557 --> 12:14.258
How could you --
why did you kill my brother?

12:14.325 --> 12:15.592
I didn't kill Andre!

12:15.660 --> 12:17.027
Why were you
trying to kill me?

12:17.095 --> 12:18.529
I didn't know
who you were.

12:19.998 --> 12:21.598
Who did you think
we were?

12:22.934 --> 12:24.568
- Who killed my brother?!
- I don't know!

12:24.636 --> 12:26.303
I ain't telling y'all anything.
Let me go!

12:28.440 --> 12:29.506
Let's take
a little ride.

12:32.371 --> 12:33.496
I know you're not feeling chatty

12:33.497 --> 12:35.031
but we need to have
a conversation.

12:35.739 --> 12:38.074
Y'all ain't cops. I don't
have to tell you a damn thing.

12:38.141 --> 12:39.809
No. We're not.

12:39.876 --> 12:43.679
But we're happy to take you
to them, along with this.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.048
Come on, Dolly.

12:46.115 --> 12:48.517
We both know a convicted felon
can't walk around with a gun.

12:48.585 --> 12:49.985
You ready to go
back to lockup?

12:51.754 --> 12:54.656
Dolly, listen to me --

12:54.724 --> 12:57.192
I promise none of this
comes back on you.

12:58.495 --> 13:01.196
I just want to know
who killed my brother.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.902
Dion Carver.

13:10.206 --> 13:14.710
Dion's a gangster
from the Magic City Overlords.

13:14.777 --> 13:18.080
I guess Andre
got back in the game after all.

13:18.147 --> 13:20.883
Oh, no,
Andre wasn't doing dirt.

13:20.950 --> 13:23.552
He's been on the up-and-up
since he got out of prison.

13:23.620 --> 13:26.188
Y'all heard the shot caller of
the Overlords got killed last month?

13:27.624 --> 13:29.892
Yeah, well, the street's
been hot ever since --

13:29.959 --> 13:32.628
people pointing fingers,
stirring up old beefs.

13:32.695 --> 13:34.563
Andre said the only way
to cool things down

13:34.631 --> 13:36.131
was to find out
who really did it.

13:36.199 --> 13:39.635
He figured out it was Dion
and got killed for it.

13:39.702 --> 13:40.536
You told Andre
who did it?

13:42.171 --> 13:43.138
How did you know
it was Dion?

13:44.541 --> 13:47.709
Dion and I,
sometimes...

13:47.777 --> 13:50.279
You know,
we see each other.

13:50.346 --> 13:53.582
And one night,
he comes home covered in blood,

13:53.650 --> 13:55.350
carrying two duffel bags.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.619
Thought I was asleep.

13:57.687 --> 14:01.089
I looked in the bags
when he was in the shower.

14:01.157 --> 14:03.492
I've never seen
so much cash.

14:03.560 --> 14:06.295
So Dion robbed and killed
the leader of his own gang?

14:06.362 --> 14:07.863
I told Andre what I knew.

14:09.232 --> 14:10.866
I thought
that I was helping,

14:10.934 --> 14:12.901
and now
Dion's gunning for me.

14:12.969 --> 14:15.003
You can still help Andre.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.205
First, we need to find
someplace safe for you.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.340
Mike,
what are you thinking?

14:18.408 --> 14:20.909
I'm thinking
we're gonna take down Dion,

14:20.977 --> 14:22.644
like your brother wanted.

14:22.712 --> 14:25.714
Seriously, you stashed Dolly
at your mom's place?

14:25.782 --> 14:27.816
Yes. Now, can we borrow
the Porsche or not?

14:27.884 --> 14:29.618
Listen, Dolly knows
everything we need

14:29.686 --> 14:31.453
to pin Dion
for killing that gangster.

14:31.521 --> 14:33.121
She should be at the police
station, spilling her guts.

14:33.189 --> 14:35.524
No. Dion and the O.G. he killed
were like brothers.

14:35.592 --> 14:37.326
It'd be his word
against Dolly's.

14:37.393 --> 14:39.027
And the words
of known junkies

14:39.095 --> 14:40.929
aren't worth much
down at the precinct.

14:40.997 --> 14:42.731
Unless we can prove
Dion had motive.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.079
And to do that, we need
to get him out in the open

14:44.104 --> 14:45.304
with the stolen cash.

14:45.535 --> 14:47.035
Now, Dolly said
he's gearing up for war.

14:47.103 --> 14:48.370
I already called,

14:48.438 --> 14:50.005
told him I have a friend
selling heavy weapons.

14:50.073 --> 14:51.573
He is ready to meet.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.675
Okay, okay. Listen,
I hate to rain on this parade.

14:53.743 --> 14:55.777
Dion's not gonna make
a million-dollar deal

14:55.845 --> 14:58.413
if there's a witness out there
that knows how he got the cash.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.248
We're gonna make the deal
too sweet to say no.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.950
Yeah, you hope,
but saying that doesn't --

15:02.018 --> 15:05.487
I turned my back on a friend.
And now he's dead.

15:07.690 --> 15:10.926
I can't make that right,
but I can take down his killer.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.695
We're gonna get Dion
to bring out the stolen cash,

15:13.763 --> 15:16.565
and we're gonna take the cash
and Dolly to the cops.

15:16.633 --> 15:18.000
Now, I'm not asking you
for permission.

15:18.067 --> 15:20.535
I'm asking
to borrow your car.

15:20.603 --> 15:23.105
All right...
Under one condition --

15:23.172 --> 15:24.473
I make the approach.

15:25.775 --> 15:27.342
Mike, this is way too personal
for both of you.

15:27.410 --> 15:29.578
Ricky has to be there
to make the intro.

15:29.646 --> 15:31.013
Someone's got to keep
a level head.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.748
I should be the one
that goes in there with him.

15:32.815 --> 15:35.250
All right, Jesse.
You're in.

15:53.770 --> 15:58.974
Man...I'm still broke up
'bout what happened to Andre.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.009
He was like family to me,
man.

16:03.846 --> 16:06.281
You have no idea how much
that means coming from you.

16:06.349 --> 16:07.783
Who we got here?

16:07.850 --> 16:10.218
Dion, this is Khalil,

16:10.286 --> 16:12.487
the friend I was telling you
about from Los Angeles.

16:13.589 --> 16:14.623
What's up?

16:14.691 --> 16:17.192
- You run guns?
- I run security.

16:17.260 --> 16:19.227
You ever hear about a rapper getting
busted on a yacht with a .50 cal,

16:19.295 --> 16:20.662
you can probably blame
my ass, okay?

16:20.730 --> 16:21.797
Let's just put it
like that.

16:21.864 --> 16:22.898
So,
what you got for me?

16:22.965 --> 16:25.200
I'm glad you asked.

16:27.370 --> 16:30.839
Hey! Your man asked me
a question. May I please?

16:30.907 --> 16:34.476
You got them trained.
I like that.

16:36.612 --> 16:38.013
It's a Desert Eagle.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.716
It's the most powerful gun
on the streets,

16:40.783 --> 16:43.485
and it is a cap gun
compared to what we're selling.

16:43.553 --> 16:45.320
I'm talking USAS-12S,

16:45.388 --> 16:48.323
RPGs, body armor,
night-vision scopes.

16:48.391 --> 16:49.691
You name it.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.359
We're calling it the, um --
the what -- the --

16:51.427 --> 16:53.061
the "Scarface"
deluxe package.

16:53.129 --> 16:54.930
And -- oh, but wait,
there's more --

16:54.997 --> 16:56.665
everything half price.

16:56.733 --> 16:58.166
What's the catch?

16:58.234 --> 17:00.535
My dude wants to unload the
whole shipment for a million.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.971
And what am I supposed to do
with a million dollars worth of artillery?

17:03.039 --> 17:04.573
Use your imagination, man.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.907
What, you arm your whole crew
to the gills, you sell the rest.

17:06.976 --> 17:09.144
How much an M60 going for
on the streets right now, Rick?

17:09.212 --> 17:11.113
Let me see. Let me get out
my little calculator.

17:11.180 --> 17:14.316
Um, oh, a lot.

17:14.383 --> 17:16.017
You'll quadruple your profit, dawg.
Think about it.

17:16.085 --> 17:18.386
You'll never make that
slinging dope, D.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.021
Why am I sitting here, trying
to convince this dude, Rick?

17:20.089 --> 17:21.589
Look, I thought you said
he was a player.

17:21.656 --> 17:24.693
Hey. Homeboy, this dude is
standing right in front of you.

17:24.761 --> 17:27.194
He the biggest player in Overtown.
- Look, I get it.

17:27.262 --> 17:28.864
I see this all the time
in the music biz.

17:28.931 --> 17:31.900
Talented cats,
spotlight comes on -- pow!

17:33.002 --> 17:35.003
Shrinks up.

17:35.071 --> 17:37.472
Can't everybody handle
the big time. It's all good.

17:37.540 --> 17:40.475
Look, I'm sure you can get
your hands on some MAC-10s,

17:40.543 --> 17:41.877
maybe a couple
street sweepers.

17:41.944 --> 17:43.311
But guess what.

17:43.379 --> 17:45.714
So can everybody else
you got a beef with.

17:45.782 --> 17:47.582
I'm trying to provide you

17:47.650 --> 17:50.986
with the opportunity to separate
yourself from the pack.

17:51.053 --> 17:55.257
But I can see you ain't ready.
So have a nice life.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.892
I didn't say no.

17:56.959 --> 17:58.260
All right.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.494
Now, first off,

17:59.562 --> 18:01.196
I want a demonstration
of what I'm buying.

18:01.264 --> 18:02.731
And I want to meet
your supplier.

18:02.799 --> 18:05.634
If it turn out that
you're wasting my time, partner,

18:05.701 --> 18:07.002
knowing Ricky
ain't gonna help you.

18:08.704 --> 18:10.105
You feel me?

18:10.173 --> 18:12.374
Yeah. Yeah,
I feel you, D.

18:12.441 --> 18:14.910
<i>A tough reality of surveillance</i>
<i>is that</i>

18:14.977 --> 18:17.179
<i>no matter how many hours</i>
<i>you spend outside a building,</i>

18:17.246 --> 18:18.780
<i>you can't see through walls.</i>

18:18.848 --> 18:21.383
<i>So, if you want to learn</i>
<i>which unit in an apartment</i>

18:21.450 --> 18:23.885
<i>your target has used</i>
<i>without raising his suspicion,</i>

18:23.953 --> 18:26.454
<i>you need to find someone else</i>
<i>to go in for you.</i>

18:26.522 --> 18:28.623
<i>College campuses</i>
<i>are a great place</i>

18:28.691 --> 18:31.760
<i>to find a highly intelligent</i>
<i>and enthusiastic workforce.</i>

18:31.828 --> 18:34.863
<i>The student body</i>
<i>may not get up before noon,</i>

18:34.931 --> 18:36.431
<i>but they'll be eager</i>
<i>to give you their free time,</i>

18:36.499 --> 18:38.834
<i>if you can come up</i>
<i>with a worthy cause.</i>

18:38.901 --> 18:40.535
Finally,
we've been contacted by a group

18:40.603 --> 18:43.004
with an exciting proposal
to fight corporate waste.

18:43.072 --> 18:44.472
Guys,
join me in welcoming

18:44.540 --> 18:46.575
environmental attorney
Mr. Charles Finley.

18:46.642 --> 18:47.976
Thank you.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.177
Thanks, Dakota.

18:49.245 --> 18:50.679
You know,
it's really heartening

18:50.746 --> 18:54.182
to see so many young people
working to save the world.

18:54.250 --> 18:57.519
But did you know that there
are some wonderful opportunities

18:57.587 --> 18:58.820
to do some good
right here in Miami?

18:58.888 --> 19:00.822
For example,
there are some condo complexes

19:00.890 --> 19:03.992
with carbon footprints
that are larger than Sri Lanka.

19:05.228 --> 19:07.128
That's a country.

19:07.196 --> 19:09.464
Mr. Finley's firm is leading
a class-action lawsuit

19:09.532 --> 19:11.366
against
the Marina Parkway complex.

19:11.434 --> 19:13.635
That's right, because
they are the worst offenders

19:13.703 --> 19:16.304
of nonrenewable energy
east of the Mississippi.

19:16.372 --> 19:17.839
And for some reason

19:17.907 --> 19:20.675
they're getting tax breaks
for being "energy efficient."

19:20.743 --> 19:23.445
Are you kidding me?
We got to put a stop to this.

19:23.512 --> 19:25.680
So I need you to document
every tenant in that complex

19:25.748 --> 19:28.583
so that we can calculate
the ratio

19:28.651 --> 19:32.087
of power suckage to tenants
on said properties.

19:32.154 --> 19:34.389
We need volunteers
to knock on every door,

19:34.457 --> 19:36.091
on every window,
on every gate.

19:36.158 --> 19:37.993
We got to get
that information out.

19:38.060 --> 19:41.396
It is time to hold
the Marina Parkway accountable!

19:43.699 --> 19:45.800
I have a question.
Yes, sir?

19:45.868 --> 19:49.004
I assume your firm will earn
1/3 of the damages if you win.

19:49.071 --> 19:51.172
Are we being paid
for this canvassing?

19:51.240 --> 19:53.341
What are you, kid?
Pre-law?

19:53.409 --> 19:56.544
Listen, I don't know about you,
but the satisfaction

19:56.612 --> 19:58.513
of stopping an ice cap
from melting

19:58.581 --> 20:00.181
or saving
a nest of baby penguins...

20:01.350 --> 20:02.884
...Is all the payment I need.

20:11.827 --> 20:14.663
Hey, hey.

20:14.730 --> 20:15.540
Where's Sam?

20:15.547 --> 20:16.717
You talk to him
about coming to the deal?

20:16.721 --> 20:17.921
No.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.868
Um...

20:19.936 --> 20:22.971
Dion said it's a non-starter
if he doesn't meet the supplier.

20:23.039 --> 20:24.472
He'll meet the supplier --
me.

20:24.540 --> 20:26.107
We covered this. You're not
in the right frame of mind --

20:26.175 --> 20:28.176
I've had plenty of time
to get my head straight.

20:28.244 --> 20:29.544
I'm not sending anyone else

20:29.612 --> 20:31.413
to scam a cold-blooded killer
with a gun deal.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.214
Besides,
we have bigger problems.

20:33.282 --> 20:35.650
- Like what?
- Like, I can't get the guns.

20:35.718 --> 20:38.053
What? Mike said
it wouldn't be a problem.

20:38.120 --> 20:39.354
Wishful thinking.

20:39.422 --> 20:41.823
I don't have
that kind of inventory,

20:41.891 --> 20:44.592
especially since I've had
to keep a low profile lately.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.328
People, the wheels
are in motion here.

20:46.395 --> 20:48.363
This is happening.
I-I can't just hit "rewind."

20:48.431 --> 20:50.598
We might not have to.
Fi happens to know

20:50.666 --> 20:52.667
where one of her "associates"
keeps his inventory.

20:52.735 --> 20:54.903
- So you want to steal the guns?
- No.

20:54.971 --> 20:57.205
We'll sneak in,
do the demonstration, sneak out.

20:57.273 --> 21:00.108
Mm-Hmm. Okay.
Except that's crazy.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.043
Doesn't mean
it won't work.

21:02.111 --> 21:03.278
All right.
I'm calling Sam.

21:03.346 --> 21:06.448
We're definitely gonna need
some backup.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.016
<i>Like con-artists,</i>

21:08.084 --> 21:10.585
<i>spies sometimes find themselves</i>
<i>in the unique position</i>

21:10.653 --> 21:12.654
<i>of selling things</i>
<i>they don't actually own.</i>

21:12.722 --> 21:14.756
<i>To close the deal,</i>
<i>you just need</i>

21:14.824 --> 21:16.958
<i>a believable story</i>
<i>and a lot of confidence.</i>

21:17.026 --> 21:18.994
<i>Of course, when your cover I.D.</i>
<i>is a weapons supplier</i>

21:19.061 --> 21:21.796
<i>who's crazy enough to deal</i>
<i>with a murdering gangster,</i>

21:21.864 --> 21:25.200
<i>it doesn't hurt</i>
<i>to act a little crazy, too.</i>

21:25.267 --> 21:27.769
I trust Khalil made it clear.

21:27.837 --> 21:29.261
We have a very small window
to make this deal happen.

21:29.286 --> 21:30.305
I hear you're trying

21:30.306 --> 21:32.007
to make room for a new shipment,
Mr. Turner.

21:32.074 --> 21:34.642
But you don't move good product
at half price

21:34.710 --> 21:36.011
just 'cause you want to clear
floor space.

21:36.078 --> 21:38.446
So, tell me,
why the rush?

21:42.618 --> 21:44.319
You got me.

21:44.387 --> 21:48.256
Chalk it up to a banking error,
as in my banker is dead.

21:48.324 --> 21:50.692
Cash flow
has been turned off,

21:50.760 --> 21:53.461
and I've made certain promises
to certain Colombians

21:53.529 --> 21:54.829
that must be kept.

21:54.897 --> 21:57.132
So [chuckles] uh, if we're
gonna make this deal happen,

21:57.199 --> 21:58.466
we just need to do it
right now.

21:58.534 --> 22:00.668
Show me what I'm buying.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.470
Where do we begin?

22:05.141 --> 22:06.775
Looks like Mike's doing okay
in there.

22:06.842 --> 22:09.077
- Just wish he'd hurry up.
- He'll be fine,

22:09.145 --> 22:10.979
but you are supposed to have
your eyes on the road,

22:11.047 --> 22:13.014
make sure
there are no surprises.

22:14.183 --> 22:16.718
Feast your eyes on this.

22:16.786 --> 22:18.787
USAS-12 shotgun.

22:18.854 --> 22:20.155
Take it
for a test-drive.

22:28.197 --> 22:30.765
You feel that?
That is sexy, right?

22:30.833 --> 22:35.336
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Fi, I got
a silver 4x4 heading our way.

22:35.404 --> 22:37.439
I thought you said
no one would be here.

22:37.506 --> 22:40.275
I can't control it if someone
stops by the office on a Sunday.

22:40.342 --> 22:42.377
That guy makes a surprise visit
here, Mike and Jesse are dead.

22:42.445 --> 22:44.012
What the hell is that?
Gas grenade.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.680
I come prepared.

22:47.016 --> 22:49.818
Excuse me, sir.
Can I talk to you a moment?

22:49.885 --> 22:50.785
Hey! Hey!

22:52.021 --> 22:54.322
Easy, fella.
It'll be over soon.

22:54.390 --> 22:56.524
What's going on?
Whose truck is that?

22:56.592 --> 22:58.526
Yeah?

22:58.594 --> 23:00.028
Michael,
you almost had a party crasher.

23:00.096 --> 23:01.863
We stopped him,
but we couldn't do it quietly.

23:01.931 --> 23:04.966
My associate was
just asking about that truck.

23:05.034 --> 23:06.334
Better make up
a good story.

23:06.402 --> 23:09.637
Thanks.
That is great news.

23:09.705 --> 23:12.407
Well, just make sure
the blast area is clear.

23:12.475 --> 23:15.376
Dion, I had that truck brought
in for a little demonstration.

23:15.444 --> 23:17.779
Now,
for the grand finale.

23:17.847 --> 23:21.716
You can't truly appreciate
an RPG,

23:21.784 --> 23:24.853
until you have held it in your
arms like your firstborn child.

23:24.920 --> 23:26.354
Just imagine

23:26.422 --> 23:29.190
your enemies coming
down the street for a drive-by

23:29.258 --> 23:32.760
and they don't know
you've got this in your arms.

23:35.331 --> 23:37.665
Make it sing, baby.
Make it sing.

23:51.013 --> 23:52.814
So, we got a deal?

23:52.882 --> 23:55.183
Let's just say I'm gonna
need to stop by an ATM.

23:57.904 --> 24:00.896
<i>Whether it's getting a bureaucrat</i>
<i>to hand over state secrets</i>

24:00.945 --> 24:02.246
<i>or a gangster to bring out</i>

24:02.313 --> 24:04.014
<i>the stolen money</i>
<i>that will get him busted,</i>

24:04.082 --> 24:05.382
<i>spies know convincing people</i>

24:05.450 --> 24:07.584
<i>to take action</i>
<i>when they don't want to</i>

24:07.652 --> 24:09.286
<i>is only half the battle.</i>

24:09.354 --> 24:12.222
<i>The hard part is making them</i>
<i>do it on</i> your <i>schedule.</i>

24:12.290 --> 24:13.557
Dion called.
He needs a week

24:13.625 --> 24:15.192
to pull together
the money for the deal.

24:15.260 --> 24:17.594
A week? The man's sitting
on a million dollars --

24:17.662 --> 24:19.430
a million dollars
that we need him to bring out

24:19.497 --> 24:21.532
for your plan to work.
He's stalling.

24:21.599 --> 24:24.468
He's just trying to buy time
until he finds Dolly.

24:24.536 --> 24:27.004
She's the only person
who knows he stole the cash.

24:27.072 --> 24:29.239
He'll want to kill her
before he spends it.

24:29.307 --> 24:31.075
We're not waiting around
for him to hunt her down.

24:31.142 --> 24:33.477
But what else can we do? He
already heard the sales pitch.

24:33.545 --> 24:36.246
We need to make sure
he knows he's got to act now.

24:36.314 --> 24:38.515
Mike, you push him too hard,
you could get killed.

24:38.583 --> 24:40.651
That's why we need a backup plan
just in case it gets ugly.

24:40.719 --> 24:42.252
Jesse and I
are gonna talk to Dion.

24:42.320 --> 24:43.754
Jesse's keys
are gonna be bugged.

24:43.822 --> 24:46.690
I need you and Fi close by,
listening in.

24:46.758 --> 24:48.425
You know the players
in Dion's crew better than us.

24:48.493 --> 24:50.594
So, if you sense something
going wrong,

24:50.662 --> 24:52.996
you can give me a heads-up.
- I'll get my stuff.

24:56.067 --> 24:57.434
Mr. Carver,

24:57.502 --> 25:01.638
when I said
I needed this to happen now,

25:01.706 --> 25:02.906
I meant right <i>now!</i>

25:02.974 --> 25:04.608
I'm doing a deal tomorrow

25:04.676 --> 25:07.111
with you
or without you.

25:07.178 --> 25:10.247
What in the hell
is that supposed to mean?

25:10.315 --> 25:12.249
You talking
to other buyers?

25:12.317 --> 25:15.285
This is
a once-in-a-lifetime deal, dawg.

25:15.353 --> 25:17.855
What? What, you thought we
wouldn't explore other options?

25:17.922 --> 25:19.256
Come on, now.

25:19.324 --> 25:20.958
I think you forgot to do
your homework, dawg.

25:21.025 --> 25:22.760
The last fool who backed out
of a deal on me --

25:22.827 --> 25:24.828
he had a real nice funeral.

25:24.896 --> 25:26.930
Hey, D.

25:26.998 --> 25:29.366
Hey, man.
Hector just called.

25:29.434 --> 25:31.535
Somebody saw your girl
on Rows on 5th,

25:31.603 --> 25:33.070
and she about to catch a fade,
player.

25:33.138 --> 25:34.905
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

25:34.973 --> 25:37.040
Hey, Billy,
break out a bottle of Dom.

25:39.043 --> 25:40.577
Oh, no.

25:40.645 --> 25:42.346
What?
What did they just say?

25:42.413 --> 25:44.181
Hector is
one of Dion's shooters.

25:44.249 --> 25:46.083
Sounds like the gang
just found Dolly.

25:46.151 --> 25:47.718
She's supposed to be
at Madeline's.

25:47.786 --> 25:50.487
I guess she left. They just said
she was going to catch a fade.

25:50.555 --> 25:52.422
- "Catch a fade" means --
- She's getting shot in the head.

25:52.490 --> 25:55.425
- How do I get to the Row?
- It's an alley at 5th and Jensen.

25:55.493 --> 25:57.094
Go!

26:03.268 --> 26:05.702
You know
how a banger from Overtown

26:05.770 --> 26:08.238
who was never the biggest
or smartest, even,

26:08.306 --> 26:09.840
ends up
in a place like this?

26:10.842 --> 26:12.142
Vision.

26:12.210 --> 26:13.610
That's great,
but I don't need your champagne.

26:15.180 --> 26:17.681
- I need a deal.
- Relax.

26:17.749 --> 26:20.584
The last little obstacle to our
business has been taken care of.

26:20.652 --> 26:24.054
So...I'm-a do you one better
than your deal, Mr. Turner --

26:24.122 --> 26:25.389
a hell of a lot better.

26:39.971 --> 26:41.705
Uh-oh.

26:41.773 --> 26:43.307
Dolly...

26:43.374 --> 26:45.242
Hey, Ricky.

26:45.310 --> 26:46.410
What happened?

26:46.477 --> 26:49.680
I was feeling so bad.
I just needed a fix.

26:49.747 --> 26:52.616
I-I'm gonna --
I'm gonna be fine.

26:52.684 --> 26:54.785
Shh, shh.
I'll tell 'em what I know.

26:54.853 --> 26:57.120
I want you to save your energy
now, okay?

26:57.188 --> 26:59.323
I'm gonna...

26:59.390 --> 27:02.159
I'm gonna...

27:03.595 --> 27:05.128
Dolly.

27:05.196 --> 27:08.632
Come on, now.
Come on.

27:08.700 --> 27:11.134
Dolly. Dolly,
you stay with me, girl.

27:13.071 --> 27:14.471
- She's gone.
- No.

27:14.539 --> 27:15.839
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- She's gone.

27:15.907 --> 27:17.941
- No.
- Come on. We got to get out of here.

27:18.009 --> 27:20.811
Ricky, right now, we've got to go.

27:20.879 --> 27:23.513
Come on. Go. Go!

27:23.581 --> 27:25.315
<i>Part of being a good operative</i>

27:25.383 --> 27:28.585
<i>is knowing what to do</i>
<i>when things go wrong.</i>

27:28.653 --> 27:31.755
<i>If an entire operation depends</i>
<i>on a single witness to a crime</i>

27:31.823 --> 27:33.423
<i>and that witness gets murdered,</i>

27:33.491 --> 27:35.392
<i>you've got a hard choice</i>
<i>to make --</i>

27:35.460 --> 27:38.328
<i>risk more lives or cut your</i>
<i>losses while you still can.</i>

27:38.396 --> 27:39.963
I've got more bad news.

27:40.031 --> 27:41.598
Now that Dolly's out
of the way,

27:41.666 --> 27:43.133
Dion didn't just go
for the deal.

27:43.201 --> 27:44.935
He wants me to be
his new weapons supplier.

27:45.003 --> 27:47.371
So instead of going to jail,
he's making a power play?

27:47.438 --> 27:49.640
Without Dolly
to tell the truth,

27:49.707 --> 27:51.275
he can make up any excuse
about how he got the money.

27:51.342 --> 27:52.876
Then he's got
nothing to fear.

27:52.944 --> 27:55.212
Jesse and I are meeting him
at Stubby's tomorrow.

27:55.280 --> 27:57.948
Now, we're gonna tell Dion
our shipment was delayed,

27:58.016 --> 28:00.550
but we won't be able to keep up
that charade for long.

28:00.618 --> 28:01.852
Why go
to the meeting at all?

28:01.920 --> 28:03.220
To buy you time.

28:03.288 --> 28:05.589
You need to leave town.
Tomorrow.

28:05.657 --> 28:07.791
Andre's funeral
is Thursday.

28:07.859 --> 28:09.326
I know, but it
won't be safe for you now.

28:09.394 --> 28:10.994
Once the gun deal
goes bad,

28:11.062 --> 28:13.330
Dion will come after you
for setting it up.

28:13.398 --> 28:16.600
Sam's working on a new I.D.
Get whatever cash you can --

28:16.668 --> 28:19.870
so Dion gets to walk around
with a pile of cash

28:19.938 --> 28:22.172
and Andre's blood
on his hands?

28:22.240 --> 28:24.841
And I'm supposed to get
on a bus

28:24.909 --> 28:26.743
with a fake name
and some pocket change?

28:26.811 --> 28:29.279
It's just until we figure out
another way to take him down.

28:29.347 --> 28:30.981
You said
<i>this</i> would work!

28:31.049 --> 28:32.616
You gave me your word.

28:32.684 --> 28:34.351
I'm sorry, Ricky.
I am trying.

28:37.755 --> 28:40.357
It's not your fault,
Mike.

28:41.993 --> 28:44.194
It just is what it is.

28:49.667 --> 28:51.702
Damn it!

28:56.441 --> 29:00.277
Hey, Fi.
Finley's army came through.

29:00.345 --> 29:03.022
Looks like the kids narrowed down
the hunt for Anson to three condos.

29:03.381 --> 29:05.449
Great, we'll figure out
which one's his

29:05.516 --> 29:08.251
right after I drop off
Ricky's get-out-of-town package.

29:08.319 --> 29:09.286
Hey, Fi.

29:09.354 --> 29:11.922
I'm sorry
things went bad.

29:11.990 --> 29:14.224
You know,
it's just a bump in the road.

29:14.292 --> 29:16.960
Here -- fake I.D., credit cards,
new cellphone.

29:17.028 --> 29:18.962
If I were you,
I would head out west.

29:19.030 --> 29:20.364
Can you do me a favor?

29:21.100 --> 29:22.683
Tell Mike not to worry
about making that meeting.

29:22.708 --> 29:24.127
Well,
of course he's going.

29:24.469 --> 29:26.803
- He wouldn't leave you hanging like that.
- You don't understand.

29:26.871 --> 29:29.439
He cannot go
to that meeting.

29:29.507 --> 29:32.275
It's not safe.

29:32.343 --> 29:34.277
Well, what the hell
are you talking about?

29:34.345 --> 29:37.681
Just give him the message...
Please.

29:42.020 --> 29:44.554
Ricky, what do you need
fertilizer for?

29:44.622 --> 29:46.490
Just reseeded
the backyard.

29:46.557 --> 29:47.991
Wire cutters?

29:50.628 --> 29:52.129
Kerosene.

29:52.196 --> 29:53.930
Jesus, Ricky.
You made a bomb.

29:53.998 --> 29:55.599
Like I said...

29:55.666 --> 29:57.934
Tell Mike
to skip the meeting.

30:00.972 --> 30:02.706
Screw that.

30:02.774 --> 30:04.408
You can tell him yourself.

30:06.521 --> 30:08.747
<i>As a spy,</i>
<i>you get use to the idea,</i>

30:08.773 --> 30:11.575
<i>that today's enemy</i>
<i>could be tomorrow's friend.</i>

30:11.643 --> 30:13.944
<i>Unfortunately, it also works</i>
<i>the other way around.</i>

30:14.012 --> 30:15.412
<i>Under the wrong conditions,</i>

30:15.480 --> 30:17.281
<i>your friends</i>
<i>could turn into adversaries.</i>

30:17.348 --> 30:19.716
<i>And the closer they are,</i>
<i>the worse it is.</i>

30:19.784 --> 30:21.018
We're running out of time,
Ricky.

30:21.085 --> 30:23.720
Where is the bomb?
I said no.

30:23.788 --> 30:26.557
I'm sorry, but Dion's
gonna get what he deserves.

30:26.624 --> 30:27.991
Dion's not
the only person in there

30:28.059 --> 30:29.927
everybody in there
has blood on their hands!

30:29.994 --> 30:31.762
This isn't the right way,
Ricky.

30:31.829 --> 30:33.797
Oh, no?
Well, it's the only way.

30:33.865 --> 30:36.400
I take out all the Overlord
shot callers in one go,

30:36.467 --> 30:38.101
maybe there'll be
peace in Overtown.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.871
You do that,
you will only make it worse.

30:40.939 --> 30:42.940
Dion shot Andrew down
like a dog.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.474
He left him in the street.

30:45.810 --> 30:48.145
And I want him to pay
as much as you do.

30:48.213 --> 30:50.314
But don't let him turn you
into a murderer.

30:50.381 --> 30:52.683
Andre wouldn't want that,
and neither do I.

30:54.385 --> 30:57.054
So we just let Dion
walk away?

30:57.121 --> 30:59.022
No. You let me take care
of this.

30:59.090 --> 31:02.259
You trust me.
I will take him down.

31:02.327 --> 31:04.628
But you got to tell me
where the bomb is.

31:06.431 --> 31:08.131
Ricky...

31:09.934 --> 31:12.903
There's a storage room
in the ground floor,

31:12.971 --> 31:14.371
right under
where they're meeting.

31:14.439 --> 31:15.706
I-I snuck in through the alley
in the back.

31:15.773 --> 31:17.608
There's a door there.

31:17.675 --> 31:20.410
Dion's calling me.
What should I tell him?

31:20.478 --> 31:22.713
You tell him
we're on our way.

31:22.780 --> 31:23.914
Shouldn't we be defusing
the bomb?

31:23.982 --> 31:25.449
No, I don't want you to
defuse it.

31:25.516 --> 31:28.285
We're gonna make a tweak on it,
use it to our advantage.

31:28.353 --> 31:30.287
It's back there,
right behind those boxes.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.461
Really think we should
just turn this thing off.

31:37.528 --> 31:39.596
Whatever Michael's planning,
it won't work without an explosion.

31:39.664 --> 31:40.897
This baby has to blow.

31:40.965 --> 31:43.033
We'll just do it
without killing anyone.

31:43.101 --> 31:46.036
There's enough nitrate in here
to take out a city block.

31:46.104 --> 31:48.105
- Where did you learn to do this, Ricky?
- The Internet.

31:48.172 --> 31:51.508
Don't quit your day job.

31:51.576 --> 31:54.211
<i>A bomb's effectiveness</i>
<i>comes down to two factors --</i>

31:54.279 --> 31:58.115
<i>the amount of fuel mixture used</i>
<i>and the location of the charge.</i>

32:01.619 --> 32:04.655
<i>If you want to create</i>
<i>the sensation of a big blast</i>

32:04.722 --> 32:06.089
<i>without</i>
<i>the devastating effects,</i>

32:06.157 --> 32:08.258
<i>you need to reduce</i>
<i>the explosives</i>

32:08.326 --> 32:10.927
<i>and place the charge</i>
<i>in an open space</i>

32:10.995 --> 32:12.696
<i>instead of against</i>
<i>a load-bearing wall.</i>

32:12.764 --> 32:16.633
<i>Do it right, and your explosion</i>
<i>will still have all the bark,</i>

32:16.701 --> 32:18.268
<i>even if you take out</i>
<i>most of the bite.</i>

32:18.336 --> 32:19.836
She's ready.

32:19.904 --> 32:22.172
Now, finally, these are the guys
I been telling y'all about,

32:22.240 --> 32:24.408
the reason I called
for this sit-down.

32:24.475 --> 32:26.910
Now, it ain't no secret
these are some tough times.

32:26.978 --> 32:29.546
We lost our leader. Some of us
have blamed each other.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.948
Now, I want know who was behind
it just as much as y'all do.

32:32.016 --> 32:33.483
But you know
what I want even more?

32:33.551 --> 32:35.719
I want to put food
on my table.

32:35.787 --> 32:39.189
And I want to stop losing
corners to every gang in Miami.

32:39.257 --> 32:41.858
Now, our enemies think
the Overlords are weak now.

32:41.926 --> 32:44.127
They think we so busy
pointing fingers at each other

32:44.195 --> 32:46.229
that we can't handle
our business.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.098
Now, I think it's time for us
to set the record straight.

32:50.335 --> 32:52.169
This is
Khalil and Mr. Turner.

32:52.236 --> 32:53.970
Thanks to these two,

32:54.038 --> 32:55.839
the Overlords have
a new revenue stream --

32:55.907 --> 32:57.507
guns, fellas.

33:00.945 --> 33:03.146
And now the only crew
bringing more heat than us

33:03.214 --> 33:04.648
is the National Guard.

33:04.716 --> 33:06.550
Uh, we have a problem --

33:06.617 --> 33:08.085
a "let's talk outside"
kind of problem.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.657
Man, are you crazy?
I called this meeting.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.092
I understand that.

33:15.159 --> 33:17.627
That's why you'll want to hear
what I have to say.

33:19.364 --> 33:20.731
All right,
check it out, fellas.

33:20.798 --> 33:22.466
Me and my boy right here,
we gonna have a little chat,

33:22.533 --> 33:23.934
go over
some of the finer points.

33:24.001 --> 33:26.636
Now, Khalil -- he'll walk y'all
through our first order.

33:26.704 --> 33:27.971
We'll be right back.

33:29.941 --> 33:32.943
Um...Yeah.

33:34.245 --> 33:35.612
Anybody here know anything

33:35.680 --> 33:37.481
about the USAS-12
automatic shotgun?

33:37.548 --> 33:39.649
All right.

33:39.717 --> 33:41.485
You got your
little private moment.

33:41.552 --> 33:42.886
Now, what the hell
going on?

33:42.954 --> 33:44.521
There's been
a little snag.

33:44.589 --> 33:46.757
My guy over at the ATF

33:46.824 --> 33:48.325
says my warehouse
is under surveillance.

33:48.393 --> 33:49.860
Can't even go near it.

33:49.927 --> 33:52.662
This don't smell right.
You trying to play me?

33:52.730 --> 33:55.132
I'm sorry to put a damper
on <i>your</i> day.

33:55.199 --> 33:58.001
I'm the one whose
entire inventory is off-limits.

33:59.537 --> 34:00.971
I warned you
what was gonna happen

34:01.038 --> 34:02.506
if you pulled out
of the deal.

34:02.573 --> 34:04.608
Oh, you don't -- you don't
belie-- you don't believe me?

34:04.675 --> 34:07.377
Here.
Call this number.

34:07.445 --> 34:10.414
It's the ATF. You call that.
You ask for Agent Torres.

34:10.481 --> 34:12.516
You say you're
a concerned citizen.

34:12.583 --> 34:15.452
All right.
I'm-a call your bluff.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.925
Moment of truth,
Mr. Turner.

34:38.842 --> 34:40.643
- What the hell --
- Dion, you just blew up Stubby's.

34:40.710 --> 34:42.846
Let's go.
Wha--

34:45.882 --> 34:48.150
Can't believe
they just did that.

34:48.219 --> 34:50.053
Did what?
What the hell just happened?!

34:50.121 --> 34:53.290
Are you an idiot? They
just tried to blow us up, man!

34:53.357 --> 34:55.125
Turner tries to screw me out
of my cut,

34:55.193 --> 34:57.694
and your boy Dion just made
a play to run Overtown.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.663
No.

34:59.730 --> 35:02.165
Dion's crazy,
but he'll never dis--

35:02.233 --> 35:04.034
Settle all his beefs
in one shot? He just did.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.536
Or you think he's lucky,

35:06.604 --> 35:09.372
walking out of here a minute
before the place went boom?

35:09.440 --> 35:11.198
He probably set it off
with a cellphone or something.

35:11.683 --> 35:12.683
It's true.

35:12.710 --> 35:15.345
Look, I saw Dion dial his phone
right before the blast.

35:15.413 --> 35:18.648
Dion's asking for a toe tag.
I say let's give it to him.

35:18.716 --> 35:20.083
- Hell yeah.
- Hell yeah.

35:26.757 --> 35:30.627
Oh, I see.
This is about Andre.

35:30.695 --> 35:32.629
About you murdering him?
Yeah.

35:32.697 --> 35:35.465
What you gonna do, man?
Shoot me?

35:36.801 --> 35:38.368
Come on, Rick.
You ain't got the stones, man.

35:38.436 --> 35:39.603
Hey!

35:43.374 --> 35:45.075
I'm not gonna kill you,
Dion...

35:45.142 --> 35:47.043
But your gang is.

35:47.111 --> 35:49.179
They think
you just tried to blow them up.

35:49.247 --> 35:51.615
Come on, man, you're crazy.
I'll them what really happened.

35:51.682 --> 35:53.517
They gonna be looking for you,
playboy!

35:53.584 --> 35:54.851
Why's that?

35:54.919 --> 35:56.987
His phone's not the one
that triggered the bomb.

35:57.054 --> 35:59.122
Cops can track
things like that.

35:59.190 --> 36:01.691
What do you think your friends
are gonna do when they find out?

36:01.759 --> 36:03.293
Who do you think
they'll come for?

36:04.962 --> 36:08.398
Hey, Rick,
I am so sorry, man.

36:08.466 --> 36:10.166
It hurts me to my soul,
what I did.

36:10.234 --> 36:12.402
But hey, hey, hey --
I can make it up to you, man.

36:12.470 --> 36:14.571
I can get you money.

36:14.639 --> 36:16.172
Andre's little girls, man --
I'll set them up for life.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.308
Anything you want!

36:18.376 --> 36:21.511
I want my brother back.

36:21.579 --> 36:23.747
Can you make that
happen?

36:25.716 --> 36:27.951
The only way
you get out of this

36:28.019 --> 36:30.253
is to confess
to Andre's murder.

36:30.321 --> 36:31.855
Man, Rick...

36:31.923 --> 36:34.724
You think the Overlords
can't find me in prison, man?

36:34.792 --> 36:38.128
You might as well shoot me now.
I won't last a day in there.

36:38.195 --> 36:39.696
Not if you cut a deal.

36:39.764 --> 36:42.232
You give up what you know
about the Overlords.

36:42.300 --> 36:46.002
They'll put you in isolation,
but at least you'll be alive.

36:46.070 --> 36:47.337
That's more
than you deserve.

36:47.405 --> 36:48.939
So, what's it gonna be,
Dion?

36:49.006 --> 36:51.341
Are we handing you to the cops
or throwing you to the wolves?

37:05.256 --> 37:09.225
Got a call from Sam's buddy
over at the Miami P.D.

37:09.293 --> 37:13.597
Dion made a full confession.
He flipped on his gang.

37:13.664 --> 37:16.099
He's in solitary
for the rest of his life.

37:16.167 --> 37:19.436
Wherever Andre is right now,
I know he's smiling.

37:20.771 --> 37:23.206
Mike...

37:25.443 --> 37:27.077
...Thank you

37:27.144 --> 37:30.180
for talking me out of...
What I wanted to do.

37:30.247 --> 37:32.315
I would have regretted it
the rest of my life.

37:32.383 --> 37:33.650
Don't mention it.

37:33.718 --> 37:35.819
I'm glad you pushed
for answers on your brother.

37:35.886 --> 37:37.721
I'm sorry I doubted him.

37:37.788 --> 37:40.991
Do you boys remember
the summer you took the engine

37:41.058 --> 37:44.527
out of my lawn mower
and built a go-kart?

37:44.595 --> 37:47.130
Andre drove that thing
like a mad man.

37:47.198 --> 37:48.999
"No fear.
No fear, Michael."

37:49.066 --> 37:50.800
Right, except
until he lost control

37:50.868 --> 37:52.836
and then took out that
rose bush. Remember that?

37:52.903 --> 37:55.238
Yeah.

37:55.306 --> 37:57.307
Man had thorns in his eyelids.

37:57.375 --> 37:59.843
Andre never told you
that he came back a week later

37:59.910 --> 38:02.212
with an apology...

38:02.279 --> 38:04.614
And a new rose bush.

38:04.682 --> 38:07.384
He planted it
all by himself.

38:09.487 --> 38:10.887
You're not saying that,
uh...

38:10.955 --> 38:12.555
These are from Andre.

38:15.793 --> 38:20.597
Told you --
he had a good heart.

38:22.867 --> 38:24.668
Thank you, Mrs. Westen.

38:24.735 --> 38:26.469
Okay, honey.

38:47.885 --> 38:49.853
<i>Breaking into</i>
<i>a trained operative's place</i>

38:49.921 --> 38:52.522
<i>is an extremely dangerous thing</i>
<i>to do.</i>

38:52.590 --> 38:55.692
<i>The consequences of getting caught</i>
<i>range from jail time to death --</i>

38:55.760 --> 38:58.528
<i>making it crucial to protect</i>
<i>your team at all costs.</i>

38:58.596 --> 39:01.731
<i>That's why it's best to</i>
<i>schedule a break-in for a time</i>

39:01.799 --> 39:04.467
<i>when you're sure your target is</i>
<i>going to be away from home --</i>

39:04.535 --> 39:07.871
<i>ideally because</i>
<i>they're meeting with you.</i>

39:07.939 --> 39:10.273
He just pulled up, Fi.
You guys get in yet?

39:10.341 --> 39:12.108
Just made it in.

39:12.176 --> 39:13.643
You find anything,
you call me.

39:13.711 --> 39:16.279
Well, Anson has gone out of his
way to keep this place a secret.

39:16.347 --> 39:17.547
We'll find something.

39:17.615 --> 39:21.184
Hey, Michael.
I thought you'd be busy today.

39:21.252 --> 39:23.687
Or am I already free and clear
of the CIA's systems?

39:23.754 --> 39:25.655
Not exactly.

39:25.723 --> 39:28.892
Oh, maybe I overestimated
your affections for Fiona.

39:28.960 --> 39:30.660
I need to know
before I go in there --

39:30.728 --> 39:33.530
before I break into
the CIA's computers for you --

39:33.598 --> 39:35.540
I need to know that
there is an end to this.

39:35.565 --> 39:36.765
What, do you want
a guarantee?

39:36.801 --> 39:38.101
That everything's
gonna be okay?

39:38.169 --> 39:39.269
Would that
make you feel better?

39:40.504 --> 39:42.038
That reminds me --

39:42.106 --> 39:45.008
I had the most interesting
conversation with your mom

39:45.076 --> 39:46.743
in one of our sessions --
just touching.

39:46.811 --> 39:48.917
Let's stay focused
on the matter at hand.

39:48.942 --> 39:50.855
Do you remember the time that you poured
all your dad's liquor down the drain?

39:50.856 --> 39:52.082
I don't need to know
about this.

39:52.205 --> 39:54.350
- You hated what happened when he drank...
- I don't -- I don't need to hear about this.

39:54.352 --> 39:55.552
And you thought
you could fix it.

39:55.620 --> 39:57.354
Your heart
was in the right place,

39:57.421 --> 39:58.912
but it didn't work out
so well, did it?

39:58.937 --> 40:00.137
No. It didn't.

40:00.625 --> 40:02.292
No, your dad
went into a rage

40:02.360 --> 40:03.560
and your mom
got the worst of it.

40:03.628 --> 40:05.462
The point is,
little Michael always thought

40:05.529 --> 40:07.998
he could fix things,
and I admire that.

40:08.065 --> 40:10.500
But at some point,
you have to grow up, right?

40:10.568 --> 40:13.803
And you have to realize that,
try as you may,

40:13.871 --> 40:15.805
you can't keep your dad
from beating your mom,

40:15.873 --> 40:17.941
you can't save Nate
from his demons,

40:18.009 --> 40:20.710
and you can't prevent Max
from bleeding out in your arms.

40:20.778 --> 40:22.946
And now as much
as it hurts,

40:23.014 --> 40:26.483
you have to do
something really terrible.

40:26.550 --> 40:27.784
But don't worry, Michael.

40:27.852 --> 40:29.519
We're gonna get through this
together.

40:32.390 --> 40:34.190
<i>Whether it's a stray hair</i>

40:34.258 --> 40:36.793
<i>arranged to detect</i>
<i>someone's opened a drawer</i>

40:36.861 --> 40:39.729
<i>or a cabinet booby-trapped</i>
<i>with explosives,</i>

40:39.797 --> 40:42.632
<i>skilled operatives know how</i>
<i>to secure their hiding places.</i>

40:42.700 --> 40:44.300
So if you're searching
a pro's home,

40:44.368 --> 40:47.237
<i>you can't just toss the place</i>
<i>like a cop with a warrant.</i>

40:47.304 --> 40:51.207
<i>If you don't find any measures</i>
<i>taken to counter intruders,</i>

40:51.275 --> 40:52.842
<i>that tells you something,</i>
<i>too --</i>

40:52.910 --> 40:55.045
<i>usually that</i>
<i>there's nothing worth finding.</i>

40:55.112 --> 40:58.114
No computer, no clothes
hanging in the closet.

40:58.182 --> 41:00.417
Why the hell
does he come here?

41:00.484 --> 41:01.851
I think I know.

41:04.188 --> 41:07.257
Well, what is that for?
Free cable?

41:07.324 --> 41:09.559
No, it's an antenna
for a combat-network radio.

41:09.627 --> 41:12.195
The army uses 'em to encrypt
transmissions in the battlefield.

41:12.263 --> 41:14.931
So I'm thinking that
Anson is relaying his signal

41:14.999 --> 41:17.167
from some
government building's network.

41:17.234 --> 41:19.980
So, he does that, he can reach
out to anywhere in the world.

41:20.005 --> 41:20.670
Uh-huh.

41:20.671 --> 41:22.772
That's it?
That's all that's here?

41:22.840 --> 41:24.407
A glorified telephone?

41:24.475 --> 41:26.810
At least if we know
how he's sending his messages,

41:26.877 --> 41:28.344
we can intercept them.

41:28.412 --> 41:30.947
Yeah, it's nothing that's
gonna help Michael right now.

41:31.015 --> 41:33.316
<i>Intelligence-agency</i>
<i>computers...</i>

41:33.384 --> 41:35.785
<i>...Make use</i>
<i>of the most sophisticated</i>

41:35.853 --> 41:37.654
<i>anti-hacking techniques</i>
<i>on the planet,</i>

41:37.722 --> 41:39.789
<i>but any system</i>
<i>can be compromised</i>

41:39.857 --> 41:42.325
<i>if it's compromised</i>
<i>from the inside.</i>

41:42.393 --> 41:44.794
<i>Hackers know you can't put</i>
<i>a drive into a computer port</i>

41:44.862 --> 41:46.162
<i>without it registering.</i>

41:46.230 --> 41:48.498
<i>So if you need to sneak</i>
<i>software into a system</i>

41:48.566 --> 41:50.500
<i>without leaving a trace,</i>

41:50.568 --> 41:53.470
<i>you need to hide it</i>
<i>in another accessory.</i>

41:53.537 --> 41:56.372
<i>Wiring a thumb drive to</i>
<i>the inner workings of a mouse</i>

41:56.440 --> 41:58.374
<i>gives you access</i>

41:58.442 --> 42:01.377
<i>without raising red flags</i>
<i>after you're gone.</i>

42:04.915 --> 42:09.586
<i>Sometimes betrayal is as easy</i>
<i>as pushing a button.</i>

42:14.859 --> 42:18.361
<i>But the hard part is being able</i>
<i>to live with yourself</i>

42:18.429 --> 42:19.562
<i>after you've done it.</i>
