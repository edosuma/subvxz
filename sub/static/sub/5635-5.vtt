00:23.791 --> 00:27.494
Ugh. That guy can't <i> still</i>
be using the massage chair.

00:27.495 --> 00:28.962
He knows we're waiting.

00:28.963 --> 00:30.730
We have to meet Mom
in five minutes.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.432
It's now or never for
our chair massage.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.901
We all know
we're not gonna buy the chair,

00:34.902 --> 00:37.504
but we take turns pretending
we're gonna buy the chair.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.105
All right, sir,
let's push it along.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.807
Other people
want to use the chair.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.109
You know w...
Listen, I've got to get back to work

00:43.110 --> 00:44.744
in about a minute, and I've just

00:44.745 --> 00:46.746
got to work out this
knot that's right here.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.314
Uh-huh...
It's just, you know,

00:48.315 --> 00:49.816
it's mall etiquette
to share the chair.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.451
I'm almost done.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.853
Okay, well, it seems like
you're real relaxed.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.355
Well, I was.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.323
Why don't we make it
even more relaxing?

00:57.324 --> 00:59.959
We can crank up this
white noise machine for you.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.261
You like gentle rain?
(static humming)

01:01.262 --> 01:03.162
Uh-oh!
Not so gentle.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.165
More like a tropical storm.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.367
Oh, what's jungle sounds?
(birds chirp, insects hum)

01:07.368 --> 01:08.601
Caw, caw!

01:08.602 --> 01:11.004
Uh-oh.
Tidal wave!

01:11.005 --> 01:13.106
(imitates foghorn)
That's a foghorn.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.375
Okay, okay, I'm getting up.

01:15.376 --> 01:18.645
What? So soon?
I hope not because of us.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.647
You know, if I were
a kid, I wouldn't

01:20.648 --> 01:23.516
be acting the least bit naughty
this close to Christmas. Oh...

01:23.517 --> 01:25.552
Well, you're not a kid.
You're a...

01:25.553 --> 01:27.453
Whoa.
Mm-hmm.

01:27.454 --> 01:31.057
I'm Santa. You just kicked
Santa out of a massage chair.

01:31.058 --> 01:32.525
Isn't that a song?

01:32.526 --> 01:34.794
Umm, you're not <i> Santa.</i>

01:34.795 --> 01:37.230
You're a mall Santa.
I'm assuming.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.065
Yes, but as mall Santa,

01:39.066 --> 01:42.535
I'm required to report
on good <i> and</i> bad behavior.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.671
And it all goes back
to headquarters...

01:44.672 --> 01:46.673
you know, if you get my gist.

01:46.674 --> 01:49.008
To Santa-Santa.
Mm-hmm.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.543
(exhales) Okay.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.045
Seems unlikely.

01:52.046 --> 01:53.713
Plus, you don't
even know our names.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.815
Yeah, we didn't tell you
that we were the Belchers.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.149
Yeah.
Guys!

01:57.184 --> 01:59.219
Well, just try and be nice,

01:59.220 --> 02:01.254
Belchers.
Merry Christmas.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.022
Geez. Way to make us feel bad

02:03.023 --> 02:05.725
about kicking a guy
out of a massage chair.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.526
Ah, I feel better.
(chair humming)

02:07.561 --> 02:10.062
Christmas morning, Christmas
morning, Christmas morning!

02:10.097 --> 02:11.998
Presents, presents, presents,
presents, presents!

02:11.999 --> 02:13.733
A letter from Santa?

02:13.734 --> 02:16.502
I thought Santa letters were
kind of one-way, but all right.

02:16.503 --> 02:18.037
Read it already, damn it.

02:18.038 --> 02:19.706
"Dear Tina, Gene, and Louise.

02:19.707 --> 02:23.209
"Per mall Santa
number 5748's account

02:23.210 --> 02:25.211
"of the Massage Chair Incident,

02:25.212 --> 02:27.347
"you have all been placed
on the naughty list

02:27.348 --> 02:29.582
"and will not be receiving
any presents this year.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.118
Ho, ho, ho, Santa." What?

02:32.119 --> 02:34.954
Coal?!
I got coal, too!

02:34.955 --> 02:38.191
Maybe it's fool's coal?
It's not fool's coal!

02:38.192 --> 02:39.892
Ho, ho, ho.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.794
ALL: No!

02:41.795 --> 02:43.196
No!

02:43.197 --> 02:45.197
<i>Santa doesn't really</i>

02:45.232 --> 02:46.733
give coal, does he?

02:46.734 --> 02:48.735
You had a bad dream,
sweetie. It's okay.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.370
Have some eggs.
Eat your eggs, come on.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.605
I'll eat her eggs.
Crap, I already ate her eggs.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.374
I mean, Santa knows
when you're sleeping.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.142
He knows when you're
awake. I get that.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.144
He's got some kind
of sensor somewhere.

02:58.145 --> 03:00.880
But I never imagined
he'd use mall Santas

03:00.881 --> 03:03.249
as his eyes and ears.
It's brilliant.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.985
We are so screwed.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.587
Louise, it'll be okay.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.155
I'm sure you'll all
get presents this year.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.324
Are you, Dad? Are you so sure?

03:11.325 --> 03:12.825
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.260
I'm sorry, all of sudden

03:14.261 --> 03:15.728
you're a Santa expert?

03:15.729 --> 03:17.397
Did Santa grant you
an exclusive interview

03:17.398 --> 03:18.831
you never told us about?

03:18.832 --> 03:21.301
Did you intern in the North Pole
as an undergrad?

03:21.302 --> 03:23.336
That's not how...
You know what?

03:23.337 --> 03:24.771
For... Just forget it.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.572
Guys, we can't
not have presents.

03:26.573 --> 03:29.776
We got to smooth things over
with that mall Santa and fast.

03:29.777 --> 03:32.411
("Good King Wenceslas"
plays over speakers)

03:33.947 --> 03:35.415
Hello, kids.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.917
Belchers, wasn't it?
Yes. Hi.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.420
Look, I think everyone
was disappointed

03:40.421 --> 03:42.422
with how things
shook out yesterday, right?

03:42.423 --> 03:43.656
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.258
We provided some ambiance

03:45.259 --> 03:47.627
that might have been
misinterpreted as annoying,

03:47.628 --> 03:49.461
you threw some major attitude.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.197
And if someone
would have just gotten

03:51.198 --> 03:52.999
out of a massage chair earlier,

03:53.000 --> 03:54.966
we wouldn't even be here.

03:55.002 --> 03:58.236
Oh, so you're worried
about being on the naughty list.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.472
<i>I'm</i> not worried.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.940
I've been great this year.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.875
I'm worried that you're worried.

04:02.876 --> 04:06.446
Everyone squeeze together
and say "cheese log."

04:06.447 --> 04:07.547
Cheese log.
Cheese log.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.981
No, we don't need a picture.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.550
We just need a couple more...

04:10.551 --> 04:12.218
Wait, you don't want
a picture with Santa?

04:12.219 --> 04:13.519
We're almost done.
Guys,

04:13.520 --> 04:14.887
I'm gonna have to
move you along.

04:14.888 --> 04:15.988
GENE: Hey!
LOUISE: Huh?

04:15.989 --> 04:17.022
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.725
LOUISE: Okeydokey.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.993
I'm gonna get to
the back of the line!

04:20.994 --> 04:23.528
I'll see you in 40 minutes.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.799
Hi.
Hi.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.135
(chuckles)
We got, uh, cut off before.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.571
What do you say
to a little snack?

04:31.572 --> 04:33.706
There's a crazy
rumor going around

04:33.707 --> 04:35.908
that you folks like
milk and cookies.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.244
(laughs) There sure is, Gene.

04:38.245 --> 04:40.379
So maybe while you're
enjoying these,

04:40.414 --> 04:43.049
which are in no way
an admission of our guilt,

04:43.050 --> 04:44.149
just something nice

04:44.184 --> 04:45.818
that we're doing for you,

04:45.819 --> 04:48.887
you forget to tell Santa-Santa
a thing or two, eh?

04:48.922 --> 04:50.990
Are you trying to bribe us?

04:50.991 --> 04:53.259
(laughs) No.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.061
Absolutely not.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.029
Tina, milk.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.031
Aah!
Oh!

04:59.032 --> 05:00.700
Oh! Soak it up with cookies!

05:00.701 --> 05:03.703
Soak it up with cookies!
Come on!

05:03.704 --> 05:06.539
We need security at
Santa's Village. Code Blitzen.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.275
Code Blitzen.
No code Blitzen, no code Blitzen!

05:09.276 --> 05:11.244
BOB: <i>Louise, it's okay.</i>

05:11.245 --> 05:12.612
It's gonna be fine.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.047
Santa stopped giving you
presents ages ago.

05:15.048 --> 05:18.084
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.751
You really don't, Bob.
Thanks, Teddy.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.754
It's Christmas Eve.
Santa's sled

05:21.755 --> 05:23.556
is gonna launch in seven hours.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.691
How are we supposed
to convince mall Santa

05:25.692 --> 05:27.393
that we deserve to
be on the nice list

05:27.394 --> 05:29.529
if we're banned
from Santa's Village?

05:29.530 --> 05:31.898
We could write down all the nice
things we've done this year

05:31.899 --> 05:33.599
and read it to him
from outside the village

05:33.600 --> 05:35.034
in our best public
speaking voices.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.536
Okay, there
might be something there.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.271
We could scratch an apology
into the ice

05:38.272 --> 05:40.039
in the skating rink.
He sits across from it.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.274
He couldn't miss it.

05:41.275 --> 05:42.809
The Rinky Dink.
Of course.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.478
Guys. We got to do
an ice show, huh?

05:45.479 --> 05:47.613
Ice show?
Ooh, Ice Capades.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.382
ALL: Yes.
(whoops)

05:49.383 --> 05:51.951
Uh, you really don't need
to do an Ice Capades.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.120
Dad, you want to ruin Christmas?

05:54.121 --> 05:55.755
I-I... I don't.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.590
You know, I followed
the Ice Capades for a season.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.659
Like a lot of young guys
trying to find themselves.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.261
We'll do a little Ice Capading
about how good we've been.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.664
And that's what Santa-Santa
will hear about.

06:04.665 --> 06:08.067
Hold on. We could call it
<i>Nice Capades.</i>

06:08.068 --> 06:10.269
Yeah.<i> Nice Capades.</i>
Love it.

06:10.270 --> 06:13.840
Oh, my God.
♪ Nothin' better than <i> Nice Capades</i> ♪

06:13.841 --> 06:15.975
♪ On Christmas Eve. ♪

06:15.976 --> 06:18.110
Or <i> Mice Capades.</i>
No, no.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.612
<i>Spice Parade Capades.</i>

06:19.613 --> 06:22.235
Oh wait, uh,
<i>Heidi Fleiss Capades.</i>

06:27.177 --> 06:29.812
Okay, so, no problem, we just
need to put on a full-scale

06:29.813 --> 06:31.814
Ice Capades with singing
and dancing tonight.

06:31.815 --> 06:33.782
And costumes.
I mean,

06:33.817 --> 06:36.718
that's a lot to do,
but it's not like too much, right?

06:36.753 --> 06:38.521
Hard to tell, hard to tell.

06:38.522 --> 06:42.397
Merry Christmas Eve Day.

06:42.426 --> 06:43.726
I got you something, Bob.

06:43.727 --> 06:45.995
Um, o-okay.
Uh, thanks.

06:45.996 --> 06:49.364
Aw.
Well, open it. Oh, no.

06:49.399 --> 06:50.766
You've never
received a gift before.

06:50.767 --> 06:52.334
You don't know what to do.

06:52.369 --> 06:54.402
No, I-I know how to...
I know what to do.

06:54.438 --> 06:57.506
Just rip it open with
your weird grizzly hands, Dad.

06:57.507 --> 06:59.674
I don't think Dad's weird
grizzly hands are that weird.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.777
It's just got
a lot of tape on it.

07:01.778 --> 07:03.512
A box of envelopes?

07:03.513 --> 07:05.881
Right! It's for putting
your rent checks in.

07:05.882 --> 07:08.216
I thought perhaps that's
what was holding you back?

07:08.251 --> 07:10.419
Oh. Uh, n-no.

07:10.420 --> 07:13.221
It's the stuff that goes
in them. The money.

07:13.256 --> 07:14.590
Hey, uh, Mr. Fischoeder.

07:14.591 --> 07:16.391
You don't happen
to own the mall, do you?

07:16.426 --> 07:19.061
Own the mall? No.
Damn it.

07:19.062 --> 07:21.364
I own a minority share
of a holding company

07:21.365 --> 07:22.865
that owns the debt of the mall.

07:22.866 --> 07:25.433
Why do you ask?
Do you wish to buy it?

07:25.469 --> 07:27.903
Uh, no, but you know
that little ice rink

07:27.904 --> 07:30.171
across from Santa's Village?
The Rinky Dink.

07:30.207 --> 07:31.941
Know it?
I named it.

07:31.942 --> 07:35.243
I named it after my dink.
It's very rinky. Hmm.

07:35.278 --> 07:37.580
Well, we need to borrow the rink
to put on a little show tonight

07:37.581 --> 07:38.947
to impress mall Santa.

07:38.982 --> 07:41.349
Oh, not a little show.
A big show.

07:41.385 --> 07:43.953
Oh.
With singing and dancing

07:43.954 --> 07:46.121
and skating
and lights and skating.

07:46.156 --> 07:48.189
And music by this mammajamma.

07:48.225 --> 07:50.059
I suppose, uh,
I could talk someone

07:50.060 --> 07:52.395
into letting you use
the Rinky Dink for, say,

07:52.396 --> 07:54.463
the last half hour
that the mall's open.

07:54.464 --> 07:55.697
Oh, baby!
Yes!

07:55.732 --> 07:57.466
I'll give it to you for a song.

07:57.467 --> 07:59.801
As in, I get to perform a song.

07:59.836 --> 08:01.803
You get three minutes.
I need five.

08:01.838 --> 08:03.972
We'll kill the mic after four,
and I'm not joking.

08:04.007 --> 08:07.042
Deal. And my brother
Felix will accompany me.

08:07.077 --> 08:08.076
Oh, like a duet?

08:08.078 --> 08:09.445
Uh... no.

08:09.446 --> 08:11.313
I'll sing and he'll ice-dance.

08:11.314 --> 08:14.883
Question:
How provocative can he be? PG-13.

08:14.918 --> 08:16.718
I'll rein him in.
See you tonight.

08:16.753 --> 08:19.621
All right, we got our ice time
and one ice skater-dancer.

08:19.656 --> 08:21.424
You know, if you need more
skaters, there's some guys

08:21.425 --> 08:22.658
on my hockey team
that could help out.

08:22.659 --> 08:23.826
On Christmas Eve?

08:23.827 --> 08:24.994
It's a Jewish hockey league.

08:24.995 --> 08:26.295
We're the Mighty Schmucks.

08:26.296 --> 08:27.729
Don't tell 'em I'm not Jewish.

08:27.764 --> 08:29.865
Great. Gene, how's
the music coming?

08:29.866 --> 08:32.000
Have not started.
Started.

08:32.034 --> 08:33.501
Good stuff.
Tina... lyrics.

08:33.503 --> 08:35.503
You did some nice things
this year. What you got?

08:35.539 --> 08:37.206
Well, over the summer,
I found a horseshoe crab

08:37.207 --> 08:38.874
that was stuck on its back.

08:38.875 --> 08:41.043
I flipped it over, and it
went back into the ocean.

08:41.044 --> 08:43.044
Someday when you need help,
you're gonna get it,

08:43.046 --> 08:45.280
and it's gonna be that crab.
I know.

08:45.315 --> 08:46.849
Yeah, that's
a sweet thing you did,

08:46.850 --> 08:48.516
but it's not nearly enough.

08:48.552 --> 08:50.019
It's not?
No.

08:50.020 --> 08:52.520
We got to wow the beard
off that mall Santa.

08:52.556 --> 08:54.456
We got to ratchet this thing up.

08:54.491 --> 08:55.824
Like ratchet it up how?

08:55.859 --> 08:57.693
Like: You didn't
just plop the thing

08:57.694 --> 09:00.696
back into the ocean, you...
adopted it, huh?

09:00.697 --> 09:03.364
And raised it as your own.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.600
But that's not the truth.
Screw the truth.

09:05.635 --> 09:07.970
I mean, the whole truth is
that I kind of kicked it

09:07.971 --> 09:09.504
back into the ocean.
Its leg came off.

09:09.539 --> 09:11.339
We can spin that.
Gene, how about you?

09:11.374 --> 09:13.142
Well, one time
at school on taco day...

09:13.143 --> 09:14.643
which I don't have to tell you

09:14.644 --> 09:16.145
is like having
a birthday once a week...

09:16.146 --> 09:18.981
I let Regular-Sized Rudy
have the last taco.

09:18.982 --> 09:20.983
And I had to eat
burned chicken nuggets.

09:20.984 --> 09:22.718
Wait, don't you love
burnt chicken nuggets?

09:22.719 --> 09:24.519
That's not the point.

09:24.554 --> 09:26.822
Ugh, it's nice,
but not nice-list nice.

09:26.823 --> 09:28.324
There are no presents
if we don't

09:28.325 --> 09:30.259
make a big splash here, people.

09:30.260 --> 09:32.495
And I don't know about you,
but I asked Santa

09:32.496 --> 09:34.896
for something big this year.
Big.

09:34.931 --> 09:36.865
Well, what are you gonna
sing about, Louise?

09:36.900 --> 09:38.734
I got lots of stuff.
You do?

09:38.735 --> 09:41.670
I do. I mean, I will.
Some of the nicest stuff

09:41.671 --> 09:44.706
anyone's ever done
is what I'm gonna sing about.

09:44.741 --> 09:46.675
I'm pretty sure
there's a preset on here

09:46.676 --> 09:48.444
for 30-minute Ice Capades show.

09:48.445 --> 09:52.413
(farting sounds) No. No. Hmm.

09:53.850 --> 09:56.519
Here comes trouble.
Oh, brother.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.854
Hi. Uh, my wife sent me here
for costume supplies.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.223
I'm glad you're still open.
I just need a few things.

10:02.259 --> 10:04.860
You hear that, Harold?
He just needs a few things.

10:04.861 --> 10:06.995
Oh, don't we all.

10:07.030 --> 10:09.030
Okay, um,
do you have fabric glue?

10:09.065 --> 10:11.032
(laughs) Do we? I forget.

10:11.067 --> 10:12.801
And purple felt?
(Harold muttering)

10:12.802 --> 10:14.737
And orange felt and yellow felt.

10:14.738 --> 10:17.540
Oh, sure, we've got those
things, but it's gonna cost you.

10:17.541 --> 10:21.342
Right, uh, well, that makes
sense, because I'm the customer.

10:21.378 --> 10:23.212
No. Because it's Christmas Eve.

10:23.213 --> 10:25.981
On Christmas Eve,
we jack the prices way up.

10:25.982 --> 10:28.016
We jack 'em to the moon.

10:28.051 --> 10:29.652
Why are you advertising that?

10:29.653 --> 10:31.453
Also, please don't
jack the prices...

10:31.454 --> 10:33.556
To the moon, Chubs!

10:33.557 --> 10:35.491
And there's nothing
you can do about it,

10:35.492 --> 10:37.426
because it's Christmas
Eve, and you need felt.

10:37.427 --> 10:39.194
Oh, my God.

10:39.229 --> 10:41.964
You know, we're having a hell
of an after-Christmas felt sale.

10:41.965 --> 10:43.766
Tell him about it!

10:43.767 --> 10:46.201
(laughing): But you can't wait
till then, can you, Chubs?

10:46.236 --> 10:49.104
No, I can't!
You know I can't wait till then!

10:49.105 --> 10:52.007
I really wish we had another
art supply store in town.

10:52.008 --> 10:55.143
♪ ♪

11:02.118 --> 11:03.953
LOUISE: Hey, I just want
to thank everyone

11:03.954 --> 11:05.653
for coming out
on your Christmas Eves.

11:05.689 --> 11:08.823
No problem for me. Coming off
a hell of a Hanukkah, right, guys?

11:08.858 --> 11:11.794
Great. Now, let's go out there
and convince that judgy red man

11:11.795 --> 11:13.362
that the Belchers are good kids.

11:13.363 --> 11:15.096
Are we all ready?

11:15.131 --> 11:17.333
Almost. I'm not
fully squeezed into my...

11:17.334 --> 11:18.867

Ensemble.

11:18.868 --> 11:19.968
(zippering) Okeydokey.

11:20.003 --> 11:21.704
Okay, we've got to be ready now.

11:21.705 --> 11:23.706
Um, Louise?
Tina, what?!

11:23.707 --> 11:25.874
I'm not exactly comfortable
with the whole lying part.

11:25.875 --> 11:28.043
Yeah, I mean, we didn't
really do the stuff

11:28.044 --> 11:29.445
we're gonna sing we did.

11:29.446 --> 11:31.146
Do you want presents
or what? Huh?

11:31.147 --> 11:32.781
No, we do.
Right. Right.

11:32.782 --> 11:35.483
That's what I thought.
Cue the music. Lights!

11:35.518 --> 11:36.518

11:36.519 --> 11:38.187
Oh, it's starting!

11:38.188 --> 11:39.954
Who's doing the lights?
Couple of Schmucks.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.190
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

11:42.225 --> 11:45.027
welcome to the <i> Nice Capades:</i>

11:47.697 --> 11:50.132
And a warm-up act...
the Brothers Fischoeder.

11:50.133 --> 11:52.234
Give it up for them.

11:52.235 --> 11:54.069
Thank you!

on, people.

12:26.670 --> 12:28.270
Um, Louise?

12:28.271 --> 12:30.406
'Cause we are gonna rock
this mall Santa's world.

12:30.407 --> 12:31.774
Um...
Rock it hard.

12:31.775 --> 12:33.208
Uh... Louise?
What?!

12:33.209 --> 12:34.642
Mall Santa's gone.

12:34.678 --> 12:36.210
LOUISE: Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

12:36.246 --> 12:38.210
No!

12:40.779 --> 12:42.546
Where's Santa?!
Where the hell is he?!

12:42.547 --> 12:45.216
As you can see by the sign,
Santa's gonna be right back.

12:45.217 --> 12:47.618
We... need him! Now!

12:47.619 --> 12:50.754
He... will... be... back!

12:50.755 --> 12:52.188
Uh, what's going on here?

12:52.224 --> 12:53.591
This unhelpful elf knows

12:53.592 --> 12:55.125
where mall Santa is,

12:55.126 --> 12:56.961
but she's keeping her elfin'
trap shut!

12:56.962 --> 12:58.528
Louise, calm down.

12:58.563 --> 13:01.865
Look, he had to attend
to some personal business.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.334
Okay, Santa's pooping.
No, he's...

13:03.335 --> 13:05.069
Everyone poops, even Santa.

13:05.070 --> 13:06.570
Santa's not pooping.

13:06.571 --> 13:08.172
He's shopping, okay?

13:08.173 --> 13:10.440
But the mall closes
in 20 minutes.

13:10.475 --> 13:13.143
He's got to see our show,
or we don't get presents.

13:13.144 --> 13:15.145
Louise, stay here
in case he comes back.

13:15.146 --> 13:17.947
Bob, we need to find Santa.
Right. Yup.

13:17.983 --> 13:20.586
Thank you. Thank you.
That's all for us. (applause)

13:20.619 --> 13:22.519
No, no, no,
we want a big happy crowd

13:22.520 --> 13:24.153
for when mall Santa comes back.

13:24.189 --> 13:26.723
LOUISE: Stretch. And now...
Oh. What is... this?

13:26.758 --> 13:29.092
Stretch.
Stretch it out.

13:29.127 --> 13:31.095
What is... stretch? What?

13:31.096 --> 13:32.997
Ooh, okay. Um...

13:32.998 --> 13:35.899
So, uh...
where's everybody from?

13:35.934 --> 13:37.368
Hmm? You, where are you from?

13:37.369 --> 13:39.336
Say somewhere good,
someplace funny.

13:39.337 --> 13:41.107
Say... Nantucket.

13:41.139 --> 13:44.073
Oh, Calvin, you've never
been good at crowd work. You...

13:44.109 --> 13:45.709
where'd you get
that hat? Your mom?

13:45.710 --> 13:46.943
(airy laugh)

13:46.978 --> 13:48.345
(squeaky cough)

13:48.346 --> 13:50.313
That's how you do crowd work.

13:50.348 --> 13:51.715
Santa.
Santa!

13:51.716 --> 13:53.683
Yeah. Yeah.
We found you.

13:53.718 --> 13:55.451
We need you.
Ooh, fudge!

13:55.487 --> 13:57.821
Um, I kind of stopped doing
ironic pictures with grown-ups.

13:57.822 --> 14:00.357
My lap is not as strong
as it used to be.

14:00.358 --> 14:01.711
Nothing personal.

14:01.726 --> 14:04.928
Drrr... umroll, please.

14:04.963 --> 14:06.830
(drum machine plays
rapid percussion)

14:06.831 --> 14:08.299
(grunting)

14:08.300 --> 14:10.334
(rim shot)
Hey, how about that? Hmm?

14:10.335 --> 14:13.603
Anyone can make it look easy,
but he makes it look hard!

14:13.638 --> 14:15.072
Come on, Mom and Dad.

14:15.073 --> 14:16.773
Bring back that rent-a-beard!

14:16.808 --> 14:19.208
Sounds like your kids
have put in a lot of work.

14:19.244 --> 14:20.677
So will you come with us now?

14:20.712 --> 14:22.179
You know, it's just that I have

14:22.180 --> 14:23.480
so much more shopping to do.

14:23.481 --> 14:24.961
I have to get something
for my nephew.

14:24.983 --> 14:26.517
Oh, Bob could get
something for your nephew.

14:26.518 --> 14:27.884
I could?

14:27.919 --> 14:29.653
That would be great.
It would?

14:29.654 --> 14:31.321
All right, come on,
let's go, Santa.

14:31.356 --> 14:33.456
Wait. What's he into?
Your nephew.

14:33.491 --> 14:35.625
You know.
Regular... nephew stuff.

14:35.660 --> 14:37.661
Well, so, like,
is he into sports, or...

14:37.662 --> 14:39.896
or board games, uh, calendars?

14:39.931 --> 14:41.751
Did you say,
was he into calendars?

14:41.766 --> 14:43.669
I did. Yeah.
I don't know.

14:43.702 --> 14:45.335
No one's into calendars.

14:45.370 --> 14:47.371
I just couldn't think
of anything else.

14:47.372 --> 14:49.505
I'll do better. Don't worry.
I'll get him something good.

14:49.541 --> 14:53.042
So the nurse says, "Rectum?
I damn near killed him!"

14:53.078 --> 14:55.890
Well, those
are all the clean jokes I know.

14:55.914 --> 14:57.414
He's here! We got the big man!

14:57.415 --> 14:59.415
Yes! He is here, people!

14:59.451 --> 15:00.850
Okay, let's do this!

15:00.885 --> 15:02.353
No! You're-you're closing early!

15:02.354 --> 15:04.955
I-I'm shopping for Santa!

15:04.956 --> 15:06.422
Crap.

15:07.459 --> 15:09.592
(piano plays flourish)

15:09.627 --> 15:13.096
Hello. This year was a banner
year for us Belcher kids.

15:13.131 --> 15:15.366
We did so many nice things.

15:15.367 --> 15:18.035
Too many to list, so we're going
to sing them to you.

15:18.036 --> 15:20.804
Take it away, Gene, my brother.
(light applause)

15:20.805 --> 15:22.672
I did a bunch
of nice things this year.

15:22.707 --> 15:25.241
But one in particular
comes to mind.

15:25.276 --> 15:28.746
♪ Taco Tuesday was
the day at school ♪

15:28.747 --> 15:31.648
♪ A day that always
makes me drool ♪

15:31.649 --> 15:34.952
♪ But when only one taco
was left ♪

15:34.953 --> 15:38.288
♪ I said "Rudy, friend,
you take the rest" ♪

15:38.289 --> 15:41.592
♪ But the only thing
left to eat ♪

15:41.593 --> 15:45.295
♪ Was nuggets
from the deep, deep freeze ♪

15:45.296 --> 15:48.732
And then those reheated
evil nuggets got mad

15:48.733 --> 15:51.001
and turned
into an angry tornado!

15:51.002 --> 15:52.735
Oh!

15:52.771 --> 15:54.438
(quietly):
I made those nugget costumes.

15:54.439 --> 15:56.773
I made 'em a few hours
ago. It's no big deal.

15:56.808 --> 15:59.910
So I did what I had to do
to save the world.

15:59.911 --> 16:03.113
♪ I ate the nuggets,
I ate the evil nuggets, yeah! ♪

16:03.114 --> 16:06.650
♪ I ate the nuggets, the evil,
evil nuggets, yeah! ♪

16:06.651 --> 16:08.585
So that's something nice I did.

16:08.586 --> 16:11.487
And now I'm gonna hand it off
to my handsome sister, Tina.

16:11.523 --> 16:13.824
(applause) Don't look at the bag.
It's not calendars,

16:13.825 --> 16:16.426
but if it is, they're
great... calendars.

16:16.461 --> 16:19.029
♪ I kissed my family
on all of their cheeks ♪

16:19.030 --> 16:21.831
♪ Then I took a little walk
along the beach ♪

16:21.866 --> 16:24.268
♪ A horseshoe crab
was on its back ♪

16:24.269 --> 16:26.936
♪ Nearly having a heart attack ♪

16:26.971 --> 16:28.505
♪ I didn't kick it ♪

16:28.506 --> 16:30.174
♪ I gently nudged it
back into the sea ♪

16:30.175 --> 16:32.042
♪ I didn't kick it ♪

16:32.043 --> 16:35.145
♪ It had all the right number
of legs when I left it, yeah ♪

16:35.146 --> 16:37.014
The end.
(Louise clears throat)

16:37.015 --> 16:38.982

(applause) Lin,
this is not going very...

16:45.356 --> 16:47.791
Breathtaking.
It's just breathtaking.

16:47.792 --> 16:50.093
Yup. Right. Yeah, that's
what I was about to say.

16:50.128 --> 16:52.830
And now enjoy the stylings of
my super nice sister, Louise.

16:52.831 --> 16:54.498
(piano plays flourish) (quietly):
Nice job, Tina.

16:54.499 --> 16:56.300
I think he bought it.
I'm just glad it's over.

16:56.301 --> 16:57.701
I feel dirty.
That's the spirit.

16:57.702 --> 16:59.535

17:28.199 --> 17:29.666
(grunting)

17:29.667 --> 17:31.268
What? What are we doing?

17:31.269 --> 17:35.120
Do I still spin around?
What do I do? <i> Oy gevalt.</i>

17:36.662 --> 17:39.420
Louise, what's going on?
I can't do it.

17:39.421 --> 17:41.189
You were right.
We shouldn't have lied.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.724
Yeah, but I didn't know
stopping was an option.

17:43.759 --> 17:45.659
Hey, listen,
you got to tell Santa-Santa

17:45.694 --> 17:48.362
to bring Gene and Tina
presents tomorrow.

17:48.397 --> 17:49.897
They're good kids.

17:49.898 --> 17:51.899
And I don't belong
on the nice list.

17:51.900 --> 17:54.235
I mean, a nice person
doesn't put on a <i> Nice Capades.</i>

17:54.236 --> 17:55.770
They wouldn't need to.

17:55.771 --> 17:57.437
They would just
call it <i> "Capades."</i>

17:57.473 --> 17:58.940
All right,
show's over, everyone.

17:58.941 --> 18:01.608
Merry Christmas. LINDA: No!

18:01.643 --> 18:03.543
No, no!
Louise, wait.

18:03.579 --> 18:04.979
You're a nice person, Louise.

18:04.980 --> 18:06.748
You do belong on the nice list.

18:06.749 --> 18:08.115
Sing it, Bob.

18:08.150 --> 18:09.884
(microphone feedback squeals)
Um, I...

18:09.885 --> 18:12.120
Wait, hold on. I want to say
something else to you, Louise.

18:12.121 --> 18:13.988
You think you're a tough cookie,

18:13.989 --> 18:17.190
but you're really just as soft
as the rest of us, maybe softer.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.993
Yeah. You do nice
stuff all the time,

18:18.994 --> 18:20.461
but you don't even realize it.

18:20.462 --> 18:21.996
Like...
your constructive criticisms

18:21.997 --> 18:23.797

are really helpful.

18:32.474 --> 18:34.776
And, Louise, I know
you don't like

18:34.777 --> 18:36.410
watching
The Weather Channel, but

18:36.445 --> 18:38.746
you sit and watch it

18:46.522 --> 18:48.923
When we were walking to school,
you told me I should

18:48.924 --> 18:51.659
put away my penis before
we got to school, and I did.

18:54.663 --> 18:59.467

18:59.468 --> 19:02.235
That's nice of you all to say,
but it's not gonna matter.

19:02.271 --> 19:04.404
You know, I'm turning in
my report tonight.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.640
(sighing): Yeah. I know.

19:06.675 --> 19:10.044
And I want to tell you, this was
amazing, what you did here.

19:10.045 --> 19:12.947
You know, you may care
about what Santa thinks of you,

19:12.948 --> 19:14.681
but I think you care more

19:14.716 --> 19:16.616
about what <i> you</i> think of you.

19:16.652 --> 19:18.686
And I'm gonna say
that you're a leader

19:18.687 --> 19:21.354
who really thinks hard
about right and wrong.

19:21.390 --> 19:22.824
And you know what, sweetie?

19:22.825 --> 19:25.193
The world needs people like you.
Really?

19:25.194 --> 19:27.761
And some tough-looking
security guys are motioning

19:27.796 --> 19:29.497
for me to wrap it up.

19:29.498 --> 19:31.131
It's best to listen to them.

19:31.166 --> 19:33.367
So, Louise, what do you want
for Christmas?

19:33.368 --> 19:35.903
What do you want Santa
to bring you for Christmas?

19:35.904 --> 19:37.472
A pet shark.

19:37.473 --> 19:40.774
Uh, okay,
I'm gonna recommend the shark. Yes!

19:40.809 --> 19:42.376
Uh...
eh...

19:42.377 --> 19:44.312
But just in case,
do you have a backup?

19:44.313 --> 19:45.846
Nope.
Well, y...

19:45.881 --> 19:48.148
(lights clunk off) And
they shut off the lights.

19:48.183 --> 19:49.851
<i>So, I guess we'll just
make our way to the wall</i>

19:49.852 --> 19:51.752
<i>and feel our way out.</i>

19:51.753 --> 19:53.054
TINA: <i>Everyone grab hold of Dad.
He'll pull us.</i>

19:53.055 --> 19:54.689
BOB: <i>What? No. No.</i>

19:54.690 --> 19:56.257
GENE: <i>Pull us to Christmas!</i>
(thudding)

19:56.258 --> 19:57.657
ALL: <i> Aah!</i> LINDA: <i>Ow! My fudge!</i>

19:57.693 --> 19:59.626
LOUISE:
<i>You know, getting presents</i>

19:59.661 --> 20:02.996
is nice, but it's not what
Christmas is about, right?

20:03.031 --> 20:04.999
Look. There's one more
for Louise.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Give me! Give me!
Give me!

20:07.035 --> 20:10.204
"A special present for
a special kid. Santa." Aw.

20:10.205 --> 20:12.205
A goldfish?

20:12.241 --> 20:13.708
It <i> is</i> a goldfish.

20:13.709 --> 20:15.076
Look at that!

20:15.077 --> 20:16.511
Way better than a shark.

20:16.512 --> 20:18.713
Very funny, Santa-Santa! Ha, ha!

20:18.714 --> 20:20.114
You're hilarious!

20:20.115 --> 20:21.848
I get it. I get it.

20:21.884 --> 20:24.685
You got to be ten
to get a shark? Is that it?

20:24.686 --> 20:26.554
Okay, I can wait.
Starter shark. Love it.

20:26.555 --> 20:27.921
Next year, though,

20:27.956 --> 20:30.024
I want a great white
under the tree.

20:30.025 --> 20:33.657
Did you hear that? I think
I just heard him say, "No way."

20:33.658 --> 20:36.761
Shh, shh. Dad, you don't
know anything about Santa.
