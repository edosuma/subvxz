00:28.570 --> 00:30.237
Excuse me, excuse me, sorry.

00:31.364 --> 00:36.201
These are our seats, asshole.
- l don't think so. Look.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.084
Awesome!
New Kids Nitro.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.757
Yeah, dude!

00:53.136 --> 00:54.470
Yay.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.517
Dude, check this out.

01:00.685 --> 01:03.771
Where'd you get that?
- Where did l get that?

01:03.938 --> 01:05.480
Stole it from the cops.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.275
Yeah, right.

01:08.443 --> 01:11.570
l've seen this one.
With the gun.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.782
That sketch
on Comedy Central.

01:14.949 --> 01:18.285
New Kids is old. Only the first season
was sweet, when you were still with Flabber.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.538
lt's entertaining but you keep doing
the same thing over and over.

01:21.706 --> 01:24.666
What happened to you?
You're fucking boring.

01:26.586 --> 01:32.508
Of course, there it is: the car accident.
Original.

01:32.675 --> 01:35.260
Sorry.
- l could have come up with that.

01:35.428 --> 01:39.598
You don't even speak the Brabant dialect.
You're actors. lt's bullshit.

01:39.766 --> 01:44.228
And a sequel? l won't spend a dime
on another boring movie...

01:44.395 --> 01:47.356
...with a bad storyline
and the usual shitty New Kids jokes.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.149
l'll look for a cam version
on the internet...

01:58.368 --> 02:02.579
l've had it.
l'm going to get my Manta back.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.872
Hey homo, you two want
to get a room or what?

02:47.333 --> 02:48.834
Pussy.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.093
Floor it!

03:43.264 --> 03:46.516
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you for watching.

03:46.684 --> 03:51.188
A rare and mysterious comet
has hit Friesland.

03:51.356 --> 03:55.359
Our new reporter Peter Vernhout
reports live from the scene.

03:55.526 --> 04:00.989
Hi Peter, nice to have you with us.
Can you describe the situation?

04:01.157 --> 04:05.285
Ladies, it's great to be part of the team.

04:05.453 --> 04:11.583
l'm in Friesland with farmer Feike
We were told he has all the answers.

04:11.751 --> 04:17.798
Farmer Feike, what's the situation?

04:29.769 --> 04:31.395
Fucking foreigners.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.361
Hey dad, someone spray painted your place.
Who did that, dude?

04:39.529 --> 04:42.864
Bunch of homos from Schijndel, l guess.
- Really?

04:43.032 --> 04:44.866
Damn cunts.

04:45.034 --> 04:51.123
We'll have five Grizzly, a nugget,
long wiener, three Bounty's...

04:51.291 --> 04:54.668
...a Ricky Martin, two Knoepert.

04:54.836 --> 04:58.547
Have you lost it or something?
How are you going to pay for it?

04:58.715 --> 05:02.551
Dude, we have to get to the game.
We'll just pay next time.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.344
Yeah, right.

05:04.512 --> 05:07.597
You also said that you would
clean the house. Also didn't happen.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.224
Dude.

05:10.601 --> 05:12.978
Ready.
- Why don't you hand it to me?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.230
Come and get it, lazy cunt.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.067
Dude.
- What?

05:20.611 --> 05:22.738
Watch the paint, cunt.

05:22.905 --> 05:26.867
See? l can't get out.
- For Christ's sake!

05:27.035 --> 05:30.704
You're always giving me shit.
Can't you see that l'm stuck here?

05:36.210 --> 05:38.170
Ref!
- Maaskantje!

05:41.924 --> 05:43.633
Kick him!

05:43.801 --> 05:44.593
Hey Barrie...

05:47.180 --> 05:49.848
...give me a dime bag, dude.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.643
Kick him in the shins!
Your mother is a whore!

05:54.604 --> 05:56.271
Get him, dude!

06:06.282 --> 06:11.953
Heigh ho, Homos from Schijndel.
- Homos.

06:12.121 --> 06:18.043
Hey Maaskantje, kiddy AlDS.
Kiddy AlDS!

06:18.211 --> 06:20.670
Shitkantje.

06:20.838 --> 06:23.256
lt's Dave. He's back.

06:23.424 --> 06:27.469
They say he went crazy after the accident,
with that garbage truck.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.058
Totally cuckoo.

06:33.226 --> 06:37.479
Are you looking at me, dude?
- Shut the fuck up, cunt.

06:37.647 --> 06:41.274
Anyone from Schijndel is a homo.
l don't have to tell you that.

06:41.442 --> 06:44.694
Go back to your fucking town
and take your homo team with you.

06:44.862 --> 06:48.281
You mean your homo team, dude?
Just look at them.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.784
Just look at those fags run.
They don't have balls.

06:50.952 --> 06:54.704
Balls?
Your mother sucked my balls last night.

06:54.872 --> 06:59.709
What did you say about our mother?
- Filthy whore.

06:59.877 --> 07:03.338
You're lucky l'm on probation,
or you'd be swallowing your teeth.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.674
Boohoo!

07:07.343 --> 07:12.597
Peter, lemonade!

07:18.729 --> 07:21.857
Ries.
- What?

07:22.024 --> 07:26.403
Drink out of a glass, for Christ's sake.
l didn't raise you like that.

07:27.363 --> 07:28.822
Sorry.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.074
Where are the guys?

07:31.242 --> 07:33.702
Smile for the camera, kids.

07:54.056 --> 07:56.683
That beer is nice and cold.
- lsn't it?

07:56.851 --> 07:58.852
Schultenbrau!

07:59.020 --> 08:02.981
Schultenbrau das ist mein bier!

08:03.149 --> 08:07.444
Schultenbrau we drink with cheer!

08:36.057 --> 08:39.518
Are you OK?
- No, son.

08:39.684 --> 08:43.688
Every night l take those fucking pills and
every week those fucking hospital visits.

08:43.856 --> 08:47.567
l've had enough, you know.
- l get it.

08:47.735 --> 08:53.198
First those miscarriages, then problems
with your taxes and now this.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.076
Hey, mom.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.286
l've changed, you know.

08:59.580 --> 09:02.832
l'm staying out of trouble.
With the law, you know.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.879
l can't afford go to jail.
l want to take care of you.

09:08.965 --> 09:12.300
Mom, l'll always be there for you,
you know that.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.553
Oh honey, of course l know that.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.264
Now, did you take those goddamn pills yet?

09:17.431 --> 09:23.687
Goddammit, fuck, l forgot.
What would l do without you?

09:27.608 --> 09:30.402
Hey, enjoying yourself?

09:30.570 --> 09:34.155
lt's from that filthy skank.
You know her, don't you? Manuela?

09:34.323 --> 09:36.783
That skank has been around,
you know.

09:36.951 --> 09:40.328
STD.

09:40.496 --> 09:44.374
A rash.
lt itches like crazy.

09:44.542 --> 09:47.836
And the chlorine in the pool
makes it worse. ltching.

09:48.004 --> 09:51.298
So where's she now?
- Dead.

09:56.178 --> 09:59.264
She got hit by a car.
- Goddammit.

09:59.432 --> 10:03.101
That's an awful way to go, isn't it?

10:03.269 --> 10:07.522
That seems to be happening more and more.
in this neighborhood. People getting hit.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.108
That never used to happen before,
or did it?

10:13.112 --> 10:15.238
Hey Barrie, what are you doing, dude?

10:15.406 --> 10:19.034
Oh, yes. He's earned it. Five euros.

10:21.454 --> 10:26.041
Ronnie!

10:28.502 --> 10:30.962
There you go.
- An album.

10:33.341 --> 10:37.052
There he is.
World-famous super star.

10:37.219 --> 10:42.682
That's right, dearest neighbor. Number one.
- And he didn't let it get to his head.

10:42.850 --> 10:46.853
Guys, if you need something,
Ronnie will take care of you.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.862
Did you just throw fireworks
inside my home?

10:57.448 --> 10:58.406
No.

11:04.455 --> 11:09.167
Stupid cunt!
- Sorry.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.962
Need a new oxygen tank, Corrie?
- Better make that two.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.649
Hey, who are you?

12:15.693 --> 12:17.777
Deborah.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.655
Why are you staring at my broad?
- So what?

12:20.823 --> 12:22.449
Ugly mushroom head!

12:25.786 --> 12:27.912
With your homo car.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.418
Fine, dude.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.159
Rikkert?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.538
Yo, l'm here!

13:11.499 --> 13:14.417
Look at my face, dude.
All red.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.921
And my Manta is totally wrecked.

13:18.088 --> 13:22.550
l think the ignition did it.
That fucking homo from Schijndel!

13:22.718 --> 13:24.010
Mr Biemans.

13:24.178 --> 13:27.514
This is the lotion you asked for,
for your penis.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.808
Apply it to the festering sores
3 times a day.

13:29.975 --> 13:33.353
And also apply it to the red spots
around the anus.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.149
Thanks.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.034
Since the meteorite hit...

13:48.202 --> 13:51.663
...three cows have been producing
gigantic amounts of milk.

13:51.831 --> 13:56.584
There's so much of it, they're handing out
free milk in Friesland.

13:56.752 --> 14:02.757
Farmer Feike, do you think these cows
will eventually stop producing milk?

14:04.844 --> 14:10.098
l do know that one cow has produced
enough milk for the whole province.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.768
And Sietske and Aafke
also licked that same stone, so...

14:16.981 --> 14:20.525
Every Friesian can come
and get free milk here.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.572
Yes...

14:25.739 --> 14:27.365
Cheers!

14:27.533 --> 14:30.702
lf l see fucking Dave, l'll kick his ass.
- Easy, dude.

14:30.870 --> 14:34.080
We'll party tonight.
Tomorrow is another day.

14:35.207 --> 14:39.043
l wish he was here.
l would destroy him. Filthy cunt.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.212
Gerrie.
- What 'Gerrie'?

14:41.380 --> 14:44.257
l'll hit his ugly face.
Check this.

15:07.656 --> 15:12.327
What? Goddammit, is that cunt
in Maaskantje again?

15:12.494 --> 15:13.745
For Christ's sake.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.960
Hey, cunt.

15:21.128 --> 15:25.131
Why are you touching me?
With your shower cap.

15:25.299 --> 15:29.135
With your homo car.
Boom.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.763
A huge ball of fire.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.056
Pussy.

15:33.223 --> 15:36.601
What are you doing in our town?
Didn't l tell you to stay away?

15:36.769 --> 15:40.188
What are you going to do about it?
Punch me or something?

15:40.356 --> 15:42.231
Bring it on, dude.

15:42.399 --> 15:45.068
lf my mom wouldn't have been ill,
l would have smashed your face already.

15:45.235 --> 15:49.822
Just look at you. Mommy's boy.
Boohoo.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.992
Hey Paul, throw in that nitro.

16:14.181 --> 16:19.227
What a pussy. lt's pink.
Homo!

16:48.132 --> 16:49.841
The cops!

17:07.734 --> 17:09.193
They'll never find us here.

17:09.361 --> 17:12.613
Barrie, why did you do that, dude?

17:12.781 --> 17:17.201
You know l'm on probation.
l can't get locked up.

17:17.368 --> 17:18.911
Our mom, dude!

17:19.079 --> 17:22.373
Did you see that cunt collapse?
Knockout!

17:22.540 --> 17:24.959
Out cold.

17:25.127 --> 17:29.464
Why were the cops there, anyway?
- Some good stuff, right?

17:31.341 --> 17:34.260
Where'd you get that, dude?
- lt's mine, dude.

17:35.179 --> 17:38.306
Found it, dude.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.099
Found it?
- Yes.

17:42.811 --> 17:46.773
Hey, Dave is such a homo, right?

17:46.940 --> 17:48.524
Watch this.

17:48.692 --> 17:51.027
No caller lD.
Good prank.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.543
Gerrie Maaskantje phoning

18:08.504 --> 18:09.587
What!

18:09.755 --> 18:12.590
Hey Dave, you damned homo.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.093
Having a good time bleeding?

18:15.260 --> 18:18.137
You know what you are, dude?
A fucking mongoloid.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.890
Fucking Schijndel. Fucking Dave
with your fucking skank.

18:21.058 --> 18:24.977
l'm going to destroy you, cunt.
- Really?

18:25.145 --> 18:28.689
You know what?
You're dead. All of you.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.275
And especially you, Gerrie.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.452
Feeling a bit better?

18:41.620 --> 18:43.663
l'm going to kill those homos!

18:57.302 --> 18:58.928
Wrong number.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.109
Nice explosion at the end.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.653
You have to unroll it, dude.

19:16.697 --> 19:20.867
Buy your own fireworks next time.
Such a waste.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.662
Hey cunt! Are you guys crazy?

19:24.830 --> 19:28.374
Do you have any idea what time it is?
- Take it easy, dude.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.502
Just fireworks.
Pussy.

19:33.505 --> 19:34.839
My blinds!

19:35.007 --> 19:38.176
Bunch of homos.
Bunch of cowardly cunts.

19:38.343 --> 19:41.137
You hit me from behind, that's low.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.434
Hey ugly cunt, you know what?
- What?

19:46.602 --> 19:49.854
A real race, dude. Tomorrow.
- Fine, dude.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.775
lf we win, you'll never come
to Maaskantje again, dude.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.028
Never again!
- But if l win...

19:57.196 --> 19:59.947
l'll get that shower cap's
ugly green Manta.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.366
Fine, dude.
- What?

20:02.534 --> 20:04.410
Stay calm.
- So it's a deal.

20:04.578 --> 20:07.997
See you tomorrow, ugly cunts.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.833
Come on, Knoet.
- Ugly cunts.

20:17.883 --> 20:21.552
Hey Ries, l have to race against Dave?

20:21.720 --> 20:24.931
Maaskantje against Schijndel!

20:25.098 --> 20:28.684
Shut up.
Do you know what time it is? lt's 3 a.m.

20:28.852 --> 20:32.021
lf you don't shut up
l will come and shut you up, asshole.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.857
People are trying to sleep.
My child is only six years...

20:35.025 --> 20:39.987
Come outside.
Come on, pussy.

20:40.155 --> 20:41.989
Boom.
Come on.

20:42.157 --> 20:46.410
That's what l thought, homo.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.663
That's disturbing.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.665
Dammit, my car.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.935
Hey cunt, hand me
that spark plug wrench.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.315
No cunt, not valve pliers,
a spark plug wrench. How hard can it be?

21:24.074 --> 21:25.283
That's an ashtray.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.205
Sorry.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.874
You know what? No big deal, dude.

21:34.042 --> 21:38.004
l know it's hard for you,
because you're a spastic.

21:38.171 --> 21:39.422
That's not your fault.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.053
Homo.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.152
Let's take it for a test run.

22:20.130 --> 22:22.506
Good nitro, or what?

22:40.567 --> 22:42.902
Did you do that?
- No.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.864
You didn't do that?

22:48.575 --> 22:51.243
Adrie, did you do that?
- Yes.

22:51.411 --> 22:54.789
Goddammit, Adrie.
That car is brand new.

22:54.956 --> 22:58.542
Do you know how much it costs?
A lot.

22:58.710 --> 23:02.755
We will deduct it from
your salary. Just so you know.

23:06.176 --> 23:10.054
lndustrial park Schijndel

23:40.252 --> 23:43.879
Are you ready?
To never see Maaskantje again?

23:44.047 --> 23:45.548
Of course l'm ready.

23:45.715 --> 23:48.801
You know what? That ugly Manta
will be mine anyway.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.014
Hey, Deborah.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.893
Wasted whore.

24:04.025 --> 24:05.192
Let's race!

24:38.477 --> 24:39.602
Ready.

24:39.769 --> 24:42.855
He thinks it's nice.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.482
Nice.

24:53.158 --> 24:58.412
Woensel! Shopping Mall,
Woensel biatch!

24:58.580 --> 25:01.332
Woensel! Woensel biatch!

25:01.500 --> 25:02.958
Woensel! For real.

25:03.126 --> 25:05.586
Woensel soldiers.
True soldiers.

25:29.319 --> 25:32.947
Woensel! Shopping Mall!

25:47.170 --> 25:48.629
Good evening.

25:50.382 --> 25:53.842
Nice weather, huh?
- lf that's your thing.

26:07.607 --> 26:09.692
What's that?

26:09.859 --> 26:12.194
Homemade bed of nails, dude.

26:13.446 --> 26:15.322
Oh, homemade.
- Yes.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.283
Nice.

26:17.450 --> 26:22.329
Could you pick it up for me?
lt's hard for me to reach down.

26:41.683 --> 26:44.935
You see?
You can't drive.

26:45.103 --> 26:49.648
You don't need to anyway,
because your car is gone. Keys.

26:49.816 --> 26:51.483
Fuckface, that's cheating.

26:53.695 --> 26:57.156
That sucks, doesn't it?
Keys!

26:58.992 --> 27:03.037
Homo.
He just hands over the keys. Pussy.

27:03.204 --> 27:07.541
l'm taking your car,
ugly shower cap.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.668
We'll see you in Maaskantje.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.811
Fuck.

27:30.482 --> 27:34.485
Goddammit, Adrie.
- Sorry.

27:34.653 --> 27:38.030
Can't l just take the new one?
- What do you think?

27:38.198 --> 27:40.366
Moron.
- Yes, but...

27:40.533 --> 27:44.953
Don't touch that car.
From now on you'll walk on patrol.

27:45.121 --> 27:49.625
At least try to get some useful
information from your informant.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.547
Goddammit mom, you need to
take your pills.

27:55.715 --> 27:57.841
For Christ's sake.
l was only gone for a little while.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.844
l feel all weak. Fucking mess.

28:01.846 --> 28:06.141
What would l do without you, Ries?
- Well...

28:06.309 --> 28:09.061
That filthy cunt Dave.

28:09.229 --> 28:10.896
My car gone again.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.399
For Christ's sake.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.281
l think he has a plan.

28:27.288 --> 28:28.580
Deborah.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.335
You work here?
You want Schult beer?

28:37.757 --> 28:40.008
Such a coincidence.

28:46.307 --> 28:51.145
His ex had the same job.
Also at the cash register.

28:51.312 --> 28:53.939
Such a filthy whore.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.191
But she's dead now.

28:56.359 --> 29:00.904
l'm sure you'd like another one?
Miss Universe.

29:09.706 --> 29:12.791
You must have room for another one?

29:17.839 --> 29:19.923
ln your face.

29:25.847 --> 29:28.015
l'm trashed, dude.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.444
Where am l from?
- Maaskantje.

29:40.612 --> 29:44.281
Who fucks you from behind?
- Richard from Maaskantje.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.992
Fuck me harder, Ries.
Fuck me.

29:58.588 --> 29:59.963
ls that you?

30:00.131 --> 30:02.257
Deborah from Schijndel wants semen.

30:02.425 --> 30:05.093
Give it to me Richard from Maaskantje.
Give it to me!

30:11.851 --> 30:13.310
Sorry.

30:19.067 --> 30:21.693
This is the New Kids snack bar.

30:23.196 --> 30:26.907
Hi. We would like three
Knoeperts with turbo sauce.

30:27.075 --> 30:31.245
We also want a Ricky Martin.
That's a sausage with satay sauce.

30:31.412 --> 30:32.913
A dick with shit.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.833
Goddammit.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.546
You're puking all over the glass
with your filthy mouth. Get out!

30:40.713 --> 30:43.507
We can't help it.
ln Friesland everybody got sick.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.385
But it will pass.
- What?

30:46.553 --> 30:50.264
l don't get it.
- Everybody in Friesland is sick and...

30:50.431 --> 30:51.974
Goddammit.

30:52.141 --> 30:54.560
Go back to your country
with all those diseases.

31:00.733 --> 31:04.987
Where are those five homos?
- You're the cunt who ruined my window.

31:05.154 --> 31:09.825
lf you didn't bring money, you'd better
go back to where you came from.

31:09.993 --> 31:14.162
Where are those five homos, goddammit?
- l don't know.

31:20.628 --> 31:25.841
Here.

31:27.468 --> 31:28.927
You know what?

31:30.263 --> 31:32.806
Greetings from Schijndel, cunt.

31:37.270 --> 31:39.938
Hey, check this, dude.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.116
Who is declared healthy?

31:51.284 --> 31:52.701
Corrie!

31:54.037 --> 31:57.497
The doctor says l don't need
those damned fucking pills anymore.

32:06.841 --> 32:08.300
Hello.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.011
No!

32:35.370 --> 32:38.830
For Christ's sake!
Fuck my probation!

32:38.998 --> 32:41.166
Dave will be destroyed!

33:03.106 --> 33:05.440
Camera! Camera, come on.

33:07.902 --> 33:11.029
l'm here in Friesland in the farmyard...

33:24.293 --> 33:25.502
Where did this take place?

33:26.629 --> 33:31.133
Friesland.

33:31.300 --> 33:38.932
Frieslan.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.941
And what is...

33:48.109 --> 33:49.693
l have no idea.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.613
Has this footage aired yet?
- No.

33:53.781 --> 33:56.867
They were intercepted.
The cameraman has been paid off.

33:57.035 --> 34:02.372
And they came up with a story
for the public. No reason to panic.

34:04.834 --> 34:08.754
And in Friesland?
Do we have anything...

34:09.880 --> 34:12.924
...important there? Something...
- No.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.810
So then... we will do...

34:25.021 --> 34:26.146
Nothing.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.492
Did you see Gerrie's father's face?

34:38.659 --> 34:40.118
What a little bitch.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.330
Go away.

35:08.856 --> 35:13.527
lf you do that one more time,
l'll take you in. Got it?

35:15.947 --> 35:19.449
Hello. Open up.
- Death race, dude.

35:19.617 --> 35:21.493
What?
- Death race.

35:21.661 --> 35:24.204
What are you saying?
l can't hear you.

35:24.372 --> 35:27.457
lf you don't open that door...
- Rikkert and you race one more time.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.918
No rules, until death.

35:30.086 --> 35:33.505
Dude, are you out of your mind?
Until death?

35:33.673 --> 35:36.716
Rikkert, you're the best driver.
Everyone knows that.

35:36.884 --> 35:38.593
You will win for sure.

35:38.761 --> 35:41.346
And when Dave's dead
the Manta will be yours again.

35:41.514 --> 35:45.183
You can't live without her, can you?
You said it yourself.

35:45.351 --> 35:47.811
But what l meant was...

35:48.771 --> 35:51.231
Fine, dude.
Death race!

35:51.399 --> 35:52.190
Fine, dude.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.570
Homo cop!

36:01.784 --> 36:05.370
So you took that car anyway?
- Well, l was walking past it...

36:05.538 --> 36:08.540
You didn't take the car?
- No, yes, l was walking...

36:08.708 --> 36:11.751
Goddammit, are you completely useless?

36:11.919 --> 36:14.462
Go get that car
and arrest those guys.

36:14.630 --> 36:16.923
This is you last chance, understood?
- Yes.

36:17.091 --> 36:19.134
Sir.
- Sir.

36:27.059 --> 36:31.313
lt's a decent car.
Too bad the cops painted it.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.702
For Maaskantje, cunt.

37:09.685 --> 37:11.186
Nice.

37:12.271 --> 37:13.438
Ten... nine...

37:14.941 --> 37:16.358
eight...seven...

37:17.568 --> 37:20.695
...six... five... four...

37:21.405 --> 37:23.073
...three... two...

37:29.288 --> 37:30.789
Hands in the air.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.295
Hey, Adrie.

37:40.424 --> 37:42.217
Adrie, dude.

37:42.385 --> 37:45.470
Adrie, l'm not part of this, right?

37:46.514 --> 37:50.475
Don't move, Gerrie.
- Yes, but...

37:50.643 --> 37:52.978
Don't move.

37:53.145 --> 37:56.564
What do you mean
'not part of this'?

38:00.069 --> 38:01.528
Adrie?

38:03.614 --> 38:05.532
You fucking snitch!

38:16.127 --> 38:18.461
We could use tape.

38:18.629 --> 38:23.591
Yes. We could put tape
all around the Friesland borders.

38:23.759 --> 38:26.094
That way the problem
will work itself out...

38:26.262 --> 38:29.055
...and the rest of the Netherlands
won't be at risk.

38:43.070 --> 38:46.323
There's nothing here, folks.
Move along.

38:49.952 --> 38:53.705
l told you there's nothing here.
Hello.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.417
No?
Show me your lD cards.

38:57.585 --> 39:01.171
Hello. lD cards.
Don't walk away.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.965
lf you don't show me
your lD cards right now...

39:18.105 --> 39:19.898
Any other ideas?

39:25.196 --> 39:26.571
Maaskantje?

39:34.663 --> 39:38.958
Those rubber bullets suck.
- For Christ's sake.

39:39.126 --> 39:41.002
Look at my eye, dude.

39:41.170 --> 39:43.671
You're such a stupid cunt.

39:43.839 --> 39:45.382
Why did you do it?

39:47.051 --> 39:49.594
Remember when l got caught?

39:49.762 --> 39:53.640
With that water gun filled with piss?
And those bikers?

39:53.808 --> 39:56.768
l didn't want to go to jail,
because of my probation.

39:56.936 --> 40:02.023
So sometimes l call Adrie
when l have some information.

40:02.191 --> 40:07.445
He also gives me confiscated fireworks
sometimes, as a bonus.

40:07.613 --> 40:09.781
Just to be nice.

40:09.949 --> 40:13.910
Did anyone bring toilet paper
by any chance?

40:16.038 --> 40:17.831
Hey, homos!

40:19.708 --> 40:23.253
l think l'll pay your mother a little visit.
- Don't you dare.

40:25.756 --> 40:27.006
Corrie.

40:29.260 --> 40:33.972
Corrie.
- Fucking cunt. l'll kill you

40:34.140 --> 40:36.057
No. l'll kill you!

40:36.225 --> 40:38.768
Calm down, young man,
otherwise l'll...

40:38.936 --> 40:40.562
See you later.

40:43.065 --> 40:45.233
Mom, get out of Maaskantje.
lt's dangerous.

40:45.401 --> 40:49.487
Why? l feel great.
l have so much energy.

40:49.655 --> 40:52.282
Listen to me, Mom.
l can't tell you everything.

40:52.450 --> 40:56.161
But take the bus right now and try to get
as far away from Maaskantje as you can.

40:56.328 --> 40:58.788
No, son.
l'm staying here.

40:58.956 --> 41:01.541
Besides, l don't like to travel.
You know that.

41:01.709 --> 41:04.961
Goddammit mom, listen.
- Hold on.

41:05.129 --> 41:10.133
Someone is coming. Goddammit,
who would come by on a Sunday?

41:10.301 --> 41:14.345
Hello?
- Goddammit mom, listen to me!

41:14.513 --> 41:17.974
What are you doing damned homo cop?
- Excuse me?

41:23.939 --> 41:26.941
We have to get out of here!
Dave is with our mom.

41:27.109 --> 41:32.822
l know. What if we take my shirt...
- Shut up, fucking snitch!

41:32.990 --> 41:35.325
What if we get a paperclip...
- Shut up!

41:36.827 --> 41:41.331
Hey idiots, what's up?
Craziness.

41:41.499 --> 41:45.502
What did you say?
- Hey, how are you?

41:45.669 --> 41:49.464
Who are you?
- Yes, of course.

41:49.632 --> 41:53.801
l know you, but you don't know me,
of course. Funny.

41:53.969 --> 41:56.679
l work for the Ministry of Defense.

41:56.847 --> 42:01.142
We've been following you for a while
from a distance.

42:02.436 --> 42:03.978
Yes.

42:05.314 --> 42:07.273
To make a long story short...

42:07.441 --> 42:12.070
We want you to help us out
with a situation in the Friesland region.

42:12.238 --> 42:15.990
Are you crazy or something?
- You are crazy, dude, cunt.

42:21.163 --> 42:23.039
We can supply you with guns...

42:23.207 --> 42:25.625
...and we'll make sure
you'll never have to work again.

42:25.793 --> 42:29.003
And you will be released immediately.
- Fine, dude.

42:32.591 --> 42:34.092
Homos!

42:36.345 --> 42:38.930
Goddammit, Adrie.
How could you let them get out?

42:39.098 --> 42:40.932
Yes, no, but those...

42:43.852 --> 42:50.233
OK, hand it over. You know the drill.
You're fired. Again.

43:03.330 --> 43:04.789
There he is.

43:06.125 --> 43:08.001
Pete Crybaby.

43:32.651 --> 43:33.818
Mom?

43:33.986 --> 43:37.822
Ries!
What happened to my house?

43:37.990 --> 43:39.449
Mom!

43:46.415 --> 43:51.336
Ronnie picked me up
and we celebrated my health.

43:51.503 --> 43:55.214
Mom, you have to leave.

43:55.382 --> 43:57.258
lt's not safe here anymore.

43:57.426 --> 44:01.304
Ronnie will take you to the bus station.
- Will do.

44:01.472 --> 44:05.058
l'll make sure you get
a ticket to Ameland.

44:05.225 --> 44:07.310
l'll book you a hotel, all inclusive.

44:07.478 --> 44:11.981
You deserve to get pampered.
- You're so good to me.

44:12.149 --> 44:13.566
Mom...

44:14.526 --> 44:16.110
...l don't say this often...

44:16.278 --> 44:19.447
Dave!
He's coming.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.074
Over there.

44:22.034 --> 44:24.994
Where is he?
- Be careful, dude.

44:25.162 --> 44:29.123
That's Dave, dude.
- lt's a ping-pong table.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.670
l thought it was Dave.

44:33.837 --> 44:36.589
Are you completely useless?
You fuck up everything.

44:36.757 --> 44:40.176
l couldn't even tell her
that l love her, dude. Cunt.

44:47.559 --> 44:49.185
Homo.

44:50.312 --> 44:52.980
Dave, dude.
Let's finish this.

44:53.148 --> 44:56.567
Meet us at 4 p.m.
next to the highway, cunt.

45:22.761 --> 45:26.514
Heigh ho homos.
Where are the Maaskantje homos.

45:26.682 --> 45:30.184
Heigh ho homos.
There they are, the Maaskantje homos.

45:30.352 --> 45:32.478
You're going to die.

45:32.646 --> 45:37.275
Bring it on. Get AlDS,
you fat cunts from Schijndel.

45:37.443 --> 45:40.862
Homosexuals.

45:41.029 --> 45:44.365
Deborah has a nice tight pussy.

45:44.533 --> 45:47.785
l dare you to say that again, dude,
now that you still can.

45:47.953 --> 45:49.454
Nice tight pussy.

45:49.621 --> 45:52.790
We'll kill you.
And your whole fucking village, goddammit!

45:52.958 --> 45:55.251
Stop it, people.

45:55.419 --> 45:58.755
Hi, l'm Anja from
the Association Against Cursing.

45:58.922 --> 46:01.174
You're going too far, guys.

46:01.341 --> 46:07.096
Wouldn't it be nice if two rival groups,
like you, entered into a discussion?

46:07.264 --> 46:13.060
Don't curse at each other.
l can give an example...

46:18.192 --> 46:21.736
ls Roy really sticking that broken
broom handle up her cunt?

46:31.997 --> 46:33.372
Whore.

46:43.258 --> 46:45.218
Ladies and gentlemen,
may l have your attention please?

46:45.385 --> 46:51.390
We have to wait here for the ferry
to take us to beautiful Ameland.

46:54.937 --> 46:57.438
Fucking Friesland!
- And l have a nice announcement to make.

46:57.606 --> 47:03.027
You can go stretch your legs outside
for five minutes before we go on the ferry.

47:27.469 --> 47:30.930
Well folks, look at that.
l think they want...

47:51.869 --> 47:53.703
Hey, cunt.

48:03.297 --> 48:05.172
Mom?
- Ries!

48:07.259 --> 48:11.387
Mom! Mom!

49:05.609 --> 49:08.778
That's a fucking great Knoepert,
goddammit.

49:08.946 --> 49:13.074
The Knoepert, available at a snack bar
near you. lt's gigantic, dude.

49:13.241 --> 49:15.618
The manufacturers can't be held
responsible for the effects...

49:15.786 --> 49:17.870
...of the changing ingredients
of the Knoepert.

49:34.930 --> 49:38.015
We are gathered here today...

49:39.643 --> 49:42.937
...because we have lost
a special human being.

49:43.105 --> 49:47.692
Corrie Batsbak,
the mother of Richard Batsbak.

49:47.859 --> 49:51.570
Unfortunately, we can't bury her body...

49:51.738 --> 49:55.491
...because it hasn't been found
since the attack that took her life.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.994
ln that place, Friesland.

49:58.161 --> 50:01.205
Corrie wasn't just my neighbor.

50:01.373 --> 50:06.252
Corrie and l,
we really trusted each other.

50:06.420 --> 50:12.925
And Richard, your mother asked me
to tell you this after her death.

50:13.093 --> 50:16.721
You never knew your father.
There's a reason for that.

50:16.888 --> 50:19.807
Apart from the fact that he robbed
your mother...

50:19.975 --> 50:22.226
...while she was giving birth to you
at the hospital...

50:22.394 --> 50:25.312
...and fucked a lot of whores
while he was still with your mother...

50:25.480 --> 50:30.526
Anyway, your father was...

50:30.694 --> 50:32.028
...from Schijndel.

50:33.864 --> 50:37.324
So you are half Schijndelian.

50:37.492 --> 50:39.618
What kind of bullshit is that, dude?

50:39.786 --> 50:44.749
Well, look. Of course she was ashamed
that she fucked someone from Schijndel.

50:45.709 --> 50:47.835
l'm going to get her body.

50:48.003 --> 50:50.838
This isn't a worthy funeral
for such a good woman.

50:51.006 --> 50:54.717
So where are you going to look?
- ln the direction of Ameland, dude.

50:54.885 --> 50:59.305
l'll kill every fucking Friesians
l'll run into.

50:59.473 --> 51:00.848
Hey Ries...

51:02.100 --> 51:04.477
We Schijndelians help each other, dude.

51:05.687 --> 51:08.606
Together, we'll bring your mother back
to Brabant, dude.

51:08.774 --> 51:10.232
We'll bring her back...

51:11.818 --> 51:14.111
...from that ugly Friesland.

51:15.906 --> 51:17.364
Right?

51:19.451 --> 51:23.579
l can't. l have to pick up
my kid from daycare.

51:24.831 --> 51:29.293
l can't come it either.
- No, dude, l'll swing by later.

51:42.224 --> 51:45.351
Can you hook me up?

51:45.519 --> 51:47.436
lt's for my dad, you know.

52:26.852 --> 52:28.686
Hello?
- Hello.

52:28.854 --> 52:32.439
lt's Richard. Those fucking Friesians
slaughtered our mother.

52:32.607 --> 52:34.817
That's bad.
- Yes.

52:34.985 --> 52:38.112
So me and my buddies want
to bring her back to Brabant.

52:38.280 --> 52:41.490
What you said about Friesland...
About never having to work again...

52:41.658 --> 52:44.869
What was that all about?
- That offer expired...

52:45.036 --> 52:47.204
...after you took off, of course.

52:47.372 --> 52:51.041
We sent in another team:
The Red Berets.

52:51.209 --> 52:56.297
Listen, Mr Batsbak.
We forbid you to enter Friesland.

52:56.464 --> 52:58.883
You're ruining our operation.

53:01.178 --> 53:02.428
Rikkert!

53:27.287 --> 53:28.746
Man, this place is ugly.

53:28.914 --> 53:30.623
Goddammit.

53:48.725 --> 53:50.893
He's getting back up, that's weird.

53:57.192 --> 54:02.279
That guy doesn't look healthy.
He looks familiar.

54:02.447 --> 54:04.114
l don't know that homo.

54:10.830 --> 54:13.582
l saw that in a movie once, dude.

54:13.750 --> 54:15.501
lt's a vampire.

54:22.092 --> 54:25.886
There you go. When you shoot them
in the heart, they...

54:35.772 --> 54:39.525
That's the way to do it, dude.
Right into his ugly face.

54:39.693 --> 54:41.443
Fucking Friesian.

54:43.238 --> 54:46.031
Look at this.

54:51.788 --> 54:54.123
They didn't get very far.

55:00.630 --> 55:02.214
Ries, dude.

55:03.425 --> 55:05.175
Fucking snitch.

55:30.201 --> 55:36.373
We are back, Biatch!
Woensel, get it? That's Woensel!

55:36.541 --> 55:39.418
Woensel! Woensel! Woensel!

55:39.586 --> 55:42.880
Catharina Hospital.
Everything. You know what l'm saying?

55:43.048 --> 55:45.632
Woensel. Get it?

55:45.800 --> 55:49.678
Have you found your mom or what?
- Not yet, dude.

55:49.846 --> 55:51.388
We'll help you, bro.

56:16.998 --> 56:20.959
Henk, dude. Can you front me
a fries with stew meat?

56:21.127 --> 56:24.713
You might be here to help,
but you're just going to pay, cunt.

56:27.842 --> 56:32.638
Are you retarded or what? Don't use
that in someone's ear. Mongoloid.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.142
Stop that, dude.

56:40.605 --> 56:43.524
Honking attracts those beasts.

56:49.364 --> 56:51.198
For Christ's sake.

57:29.654 --> 57:33.949
Hey Robbie, how's that possible?
That star went into his head, right?

57:34.117 --> 57:35.784
You have to hit the brain, dude.

57:36.828 --> 57:38.454
Throw harder, cunt.

57:49.424 --> 57:50.549
Grizzly!

58:03.313 --> 58:08.150
Hey Barrie, do you also have hasj?

58:09.319 --> 58:13.989
Just give me for 15 euros and
a pre-rolled joint. Keep the change.

58:18.953 --> 58:20.412
See you later.

59:02.830 --> 59:04.706
Jackass!

59:18.846 --> 59:21.223
For Christ's sake.
That's a strange coincidence.

59:21.391 --> 59:26.228
lt is. l did have enough bullets earlier.
- Me too, dude. l was firing away.

59:26.396 --> 59:27.980
Just our luck.

59:33.736 --> 59:34.903
Hey, fuckers.

59:38.950 --> 59:40.450
See you later.

59:45.039 --> 59:49.751
Hey Ries, did that flame go
inside the hose?

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:02.264
My dad, dude.

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:05.434
That guy was a great deep-fry cook,
for Christ's sake.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.437
He made everything super crunchy.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:11.982
Ferry Ameland 34 km

01:00:33.379 --> 01:00:37.841
OK. No big deal,
but l think l'm in love with Deborah.

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:42.721
After that one fuck? Do you only
like pregnant bitches or what?

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:46.141
lt happens.
That's just a coincidence.

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:50.646
That Manuela was just a filthy whore,
but she is a beautiful broad.

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:54.650
She's boozing while she's pregnant.
She does whatever she wants.

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:57.277
l think that's beautiful.

01:00:57.445 --> 01:00:59.821
l never had a father myself.

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:04.493
But l could be there for her kid.
l'd raise him as my own.

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:07.496
Even if he would be a mongoloid
or something.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:11.124
Or premature
with water in the brain.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:43.365
Can someone please turn off
that fucking song.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:46.118
Goddammit. Fucking Friesians.

01:01:47.328 --> 01:01:48.787
Sorry.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.557
Mom!

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:09.850
Boys!

01:02:12.603 --> 01:02:15.647
Dad.
l thought you were dead, dude.

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:21.194
Of course not. l wanted to get here early,
so l could heat up the oil.

01:02:21.362 --> 01:02:26.575
Does anyone want something deep-fried?
- Some bakpaos?

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:27.909
Or not?

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:36.084
l'm going to get my mom.
- Wait.

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.795
Ries, dude.
What do you think?

01:02:38.963 --> 01:02:40.922
That she didn't turn
into one of those beasts?

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:45.427
lf you blow her head off, you'll have
to drag her headless body back home.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:48.972
lt's up to you, dude.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.116
No!

01:03:19.003 --> 01:03:23.089
For Christ's sake.
Fucking vampires.

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:25.842
Gerrie.

01:03:28.679 --> 01:03:32.724
What do we have here?
Where did you get it?

01:03:38.439 --> 01:03:40.065
Good quality.

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:46.822
Hey, cunt.

01:03:57.291 --> 01:04:13.557
Mom!

01:04:23.901 --> 01:04:25.318
Mom?

01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:37.998
That fucking horn, man.
Hey, Ries.

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:43.461
Mom, l love you.

01:04:59.812 --> 01:05:00.896
Fuck!

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:19.456
Fuck!
What an idiot.

01:05:19.624 --> 01:05:22.083
Only Dave and Deborah
can save us now.

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:39.893
Yes?

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:44.564
Later.

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:46.524
Adrie's coming to save us.

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:53.281
That car is loaded with my fireworks.
He's going to light it up and jump out.

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:55.700
Right here. Boom.

01:05:55.868 --> 01:05:59.454
A ball of fire like this.
Just wait.

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.472
Dead.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:22.560
For Christ's sake.
Enough already.

01:06:22.728 --> 01:06:24.896
Ugly fucks...

01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:29.651
...the only thing l want
is to bury my mom. Get it?

01:06:30.569 --> 01:06:33.446
We're going to take care of this
right now. Race!

01:06:33.614 --> 01:06:36.783
Rikkert against one of you.

01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:39.202
They won't understand that, dude.

01:06:46.627 --> 01:06:48.503
That vampire is pretty much dead.

01:06:50.631 --> 01:06:54.509
He has nothing to lose, dude.
- So what have we got to lose?

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:00.724
Nice.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:21.828
l can't see a fucking thing.
- Dude, the Manta is ahead.

01:07:32.339 --> 01:07:34.466
Ford Capri, 2 liters laser...

01:07:34.633 --> 01:07:36.342
lt's fucking fast.

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:45.894
ls the mongoloid climbing on the roof?
- No.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.577
Boring.

01:08:05.956 --> 01:08:09.584
No cunt, don't shoot the car.
Shoot him in the face.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.399
Yes!

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:40.490
Put them on the train!

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:03.763
Hey, Dave.
There you are again. How's it going?

01:09:05.057 --> 01:09:09.519
Nice to see that Maaskantje and Schijndel
grew a bit closer together. Right, Dave?

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:17.109
Dave. That fuckface.
He's been useless.

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:20.613
Found this in my inside pocket.

01:09:28.913 --> 01:09:30.415
AlDS.

01:09:37.214 --> 01:09:40.425
Good idea to put them on a train.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.599
You saved the Netherlands.

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:01.821
l didn't know he liked Chinese too.

01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:08.620
l didn't know he liked Chinese.

01:10:09.538 --> 01:10:10.705
Chinese.

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:17.545
Anyway, l feel honored to inform you
that Her Majesty the Queen is pleased...

01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:22.967
...to make you a member
in the Order of Oranje Nassau.

01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:35.855
Right, well, one more thing.
Two things actually.

01:10:36.023 --> 01:10:38.733
So here it is:

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:41.361
Fuck whores
and never work again.

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:58.294
Wait.
We want to bury my mom first.

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:04.926
let me fuck whores
and never work again

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:08.304
fuck whores
and never work again

01:11:08.472 --> 01:11:14.060
only fuck whores
and never work again

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:23.069
fuck whores
and never work again

01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:24.988
only fuck whores...

01:11:25.155 --> 01:11:27.615
Goddammit, that song hits the spot.

01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:32.912
Hey. l hit your mom's spot last week.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.164
Come on.

01:11:35.332 --> 01:11:40.253
let me fuck whores
and never work again

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:43.756
fuck whores
and never work again

01:11:43.924 --> 01:11:49.137
only fuck whores
and never work again

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:56.561
lndeed, a parking lot.
Yep.

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:58.813
Cover the region with asphalt.

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:02.025
Fucking Friesland.

01:12:16.373 --> 01:12:17.832
Hey, Ries.

01:12:25.799 --> 01:12:27.258
Ries.

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.636
Goddammit.

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:38.936
Sorry.

01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:48.905
And action.
- Hi, l'm Jurgen.

01:12:49.073 --> 01:12:52.617
l won a part in New Kids Nitro
and l'm Jurgen.

01:12:56.872 --> 01:12:58.873
New Kids Nitro, dude.

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:09.801
For Christ's sake
that's a strange coincidence.

01:13:09.968 --> 01:13:12.387
lt is. l did have enough bullets earlier.

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:14.514
lt's the PulpShow!

01:13:14.681 --> 01:13:16.516
He has a plan.

01:13:16.683 --> 01:13:18.142
He likes that.

01:13:27.277 --> 01:13:31.030
Ricardo, muff-diving king, where are you?
- He's crazy or not?

01:13:31.198 --> 01:13:35.118
Hey Ricardo, do you have
some bus tickets for...

01:13:35.285 --> 01:13:36.411
...for the bus.

01:13:56.223 --> 01:13:57.682
Floor it.

01:14:02.062 --> 01:14:04.564
For fuck's sake!

01:14:04.731 --> 01:14:08.359
Hey, cunt. Are you completely crazy
or something?

01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:10.945
Forgot my lines.

01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:13.322
Listen, mom.

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:18.995
Fuck off to your own
cunt town and take that cunt...

01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:20.955
Hey, l think...

01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:25.209
The cops!

01:14:38.849 --> 01:14:42.727
Made by Filipino children.
Precision work.

01:15:11.465 --> 01:15:13.216
Hit the brain, dude.

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:56.551
Yo, it's me.
Do you know where l am?

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:59.387
ln the theater.
You wanna know what l watched?

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:01.305
New Kids Nitro, dude.

01:16:01.473 --> 01:16:04.141
Huh? No, Nitro.

01:16:04.309 --> 01:16:06.811
Yo, that movie, right?

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:11.148
Yes, no, really, dude.
Huh? Sure, better than part one.

01:16:12.526 --> 01:16:17.488
lt starts off with the same thing,
kind of. With those guys, you know.

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:21.200
At some point, they get into a fight
with another town over there in...

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:24.745
...you know, Brabant.
Yes, Sint Oedelrode.

01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:27.832
Yes, that's in Brabant.
lt's all set in Brabant.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.420
They get into a fight
and go nuts.

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:35.089
But it takes too much time,
so they build a time machine.

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:38.926
Those other guys change into werewolves
and they keep walking around.

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:42.930
And you won't believe this...
l didn't see it coming, anyway...

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:44.932
Robots.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:49.061
Yes, real robots.
Yes, real fucking robots, dude.

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:59.822
Fucking whores.

01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:12.668
Sorry.

01:17:14.588 --> 01:17:18.257
Nice town, Maaskantje, isn't it?
- Yes.
