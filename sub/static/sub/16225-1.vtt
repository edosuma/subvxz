00:34.576 --> 00:36.328
I hate this part.

00:36.495 --> 00:39.294
You're still here but I know
you're going and I hate that.

00:39.456 --> 00:42.505
Well, I'll call you, baby.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.466
Don't tease me.

00:48.131 --> 00:51.101
I miss you so much
when you're gone.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.599
Well, I miss you too, baby.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.932
Listen, last time Streck told me...

00:57.099 --> 00:59.773
if I bellyached about you
for one more minute...

00:59.935 --> 01:02.154
he was gonna toss my ass
right off the ship.

01:03.272 --> 01:07.652
You tell Streck
your ass belongs to me...

01:07.818 --> 01:11.994
- And he can keep his hands off it.
- All right.

01:14.825 --> 01:18.170
My class wants you to come by
when you get back.

01:19.663 --> 01:24.464
I think I can arrange a visit
if you're nice.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.338
How nice?

01:33.135 --> 01:35.058
You like fruit?

01:36.722 --> 01:38.349
Yeah.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.981
Well...

01:44.855 --> 01:47.699
- Come here a minute. Come here.
- Ha, ha. Ha, ha.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.569
Ain't that a peach?

01:52.321 --> 01:53.868
Hm?

01:54.031 --> 01:56.875
- Is that for me?
- That's for you.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.829
<i>Victory, this is Mission Control.</i>

01:59.995 --> 02:01.087
<i>All systems are go.</i>

02:01.246 --> 02:04.216
<i>Flight commander,
all computers are functioning.</i>

02:04.374 --> 02:06.547
<i>The crew of Victory has been given a go...</i>

02:06.710 --> 02:08.586
<i>for orbit operations
by Mission Control.</i>

02:08.753 --> 02:10.256
<i>Crew members are doing well...</i>

02:10.464 --> 02:13.343
<i>and all systems of the orbiter
are performing satisfactorily.</i>

02:13.508 --> 02:19.390
<i>Three, two, one, zero and liftoff.</i>

02:20.849 --> 02:23.728
<i>Mission Control, we have left the pad.</i>

02:23.894 --> 02:25.237
Roger <i>that,</i> Victory.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.568
<i>You are go for throttle up.</i>

02:27.731 --> 02:30.405
<i>Mission Control,
this is Victory. We have throttled up.</i>

02:30.567 --> 02:32.615
<i>It's a fine day for flying, Houston.</i>

02:34.112 --> 02:36.410
<i>All systems are go.</i>

02:44.748 --> 02:46.591
Pineapples!

02:46.750 --> 02:50.129
- What do they have in Kansas?
- Corn.

02:50.295 --> 02:54.766
Yes, corn. And what about Georgia?

02:54.925 --> 02:58.099
- What do they have in Georgia?
- Peaches.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.309
Very good.

03:00.514 --> 03:05.270
- And what do we have here in Florida?
- Oranges!

03:05.435 --> 03:07.779
And rocket ships.

03:07.938 --> 03:11.283
Yes, Calvin, and rocket ships.

03:11.775 --> 03:15.154
- Mrs. Armacost, you have a phone call.
- Thank you, Brian.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.118
Okay, let's go to page seven.

03:18.156 --> 03:21.080
And work quietly, okay?

03:24.413 --> 03:25.756
<i>- Hello.
- Mrs. Armacost.</i>

03:25.914 --> 03:27.336
Yes, this is Jillian Armacost.

03:27.499 --> 03:30.093
<i>Mrs. Armacost,
NASA communications.</i>

03:30.252 --> 03:32.346
<i>We have your husband for you.</i>

03:32.546 --> 03:34.139
<i>Go ahead, commander.</i>

03:34.297 --> 03:36.641
<i>- Jillian?</i>
- Spencer?

03:36.800 --> 03:39.428
<i>Yeah, I told you I'd call.
It's amazing, isn't it?</i>

03:39.594 --> 03:42.347
<i>- Yes, amazing.
- Hey, Jill.</i>

03:44.141 --> 03:47.145
<i>- Yeah.
- What are you wearing?</i>

03:47.310 --> 03:49.278
Spencer.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.440
<i>Come on, now.
Ain't nobody else listening.</i>

03:51.606 --> 03:54.985
<i>Not exactly, commander.
Including Houston and JPL...</i>

03:55.152 --> 03:57.120
<i>there are about 300 folks
on the line today.</i>

03:58.822 --> 04:02.622
<i>- It's a nice day down there?
- Beautiful.</i>

04:02.784 --> 04:04.786
<i>Can you see outside, Jill?</i>

04:05.954 --> 04:07.547
Yeah.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.300
<i>Fifteen seconds, commander.</i>

04:10.459 --> 04:12.177
<i>I'm right above you.</i>

04:13.670 --> 04:16.798
<i>- You looking up, honey?
- Ten seconds.</i>

04:17.632 --> 04:20.180
<i>Won't you smile for me?</i>

04:20.343 --> 04:22.687
I already am.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.349
He called you from outer space?

04:25.515 --> 04:28.815
Well, technically,
from Earth's orbit but, yes.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.399
He called me from the orbiter.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.857
Stanley won't call me
from the Beef and Brew...

04:33.023 --> 04:35.526
And you get a call from outer space.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.160
The Earth's orbit, whatever.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.663
Technically speaking, Jill, you scored.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.241
I don't get it.
We grew up in the same house.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.206
You land Johnny Rocket boy.
I get different versions of...

04:45.368 --> 04:46.870
Throws-Up-On-Himself Elmo.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.874
I bet he's good at the little things too,
isn't he?

04:52.334 --> 04:54.086
What little things?

04:54.252 --> 04:57.176
Just those little things
that mean so much.

04:57.756 --> 05:01.181
It's true. You know,
men are like parking spaces.

05:01.343 --> 05:02.560
The good ones are taken...

05:02.719 --> 05:05.768
and all the available ones
are handicapped.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.735
What?

05:15.398 --> 05:17.275
Spencer.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.700
- And now, <i>back</i> to our program.
- Nan, something happened.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.164
Come on.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.745
Keep checking.

05:30.747 --> 05:34.377
Mrs. Armacost,
I'm Sherman Reese from NASA.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.261
- It's your husband.
- What's happened?

05:36.419 --> 05:38.217
Well, we'd like you to come with us.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.599
- We have a car.
- Something about Spencer!

05:40.757 --> 05:42.054
Please, Mrs. Armacost.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.436
- Captain Streck's wife is already there.
- Jill!

05:45.053 --> 05:46.305
The director wants...

05:46.471 --> 05:48.599
<i>The condition of Armacost
and Streck...</i>

05:48.765 --> 05:52.395
<i>as well as the rest of the shuttle crew
is at this time unknown.</i>

05:52.561 --> 05:54.108
<i>Reporting live from NASA...</i>

05:54.312 --> 05:55.689
ls my husband dead?

05:56.481 --> 05:58.483
I don't know anything
about your husband.

05:58.692 --> 06:03.118
- Is my husband dead?
- Ma'am, I just don't know.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.953
Then take me to someone who does.

06:19.588 --> 06:22.762
- He's dead. I know he's dead.
- No, they're not dead.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.803
They're not dead.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.814
- What have they told you?
- Nothing.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.441
They won't tell me anything.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.653
Mrs. Streck, Mrs. Armacost.

06:36.813 --> 06:40.158
- First, your husbands are alive.
- Oh, thank God.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.785
They're back on the orbiter...

06:41.943 --> 06:44.492
and we're gonna
bring them down immediately.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.951
What happened up there?

06:46.114 --> 06:48.367
Your husbands
were outside the orbiter...

06:48.533 --> 06:50.535
performing some repairs
on a satellite.

06:50.744 --> 06:55.841
There was an explosion and
we lost contact with both astronauts...

06:55.999 --> 06:57.842
for about two minutes.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.799
- You lost contact?
- What?

07:01.004 --> 07:03.678
- What do you mean, lost contact?
- After the explosion...

07:03.840 --> 07:05.513
they drifted behind the shuttle.

07:05.675 --> 07:09.305
We had to bring the craft around
180 degrees to get them.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.475
- They were all alone?
- But now, they're back on the shuttle...

07:12.641 --> 07:15.520
and they'll be back down here
<i>as</i> soon as we can manage it.

07:15.685 --> 07:20.691
Mr. Reese here will stay with you
until we can get you to them.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.537
They were all alone out there, Jillian.

07:29.574 --> 07:32.544
It's okay. They're alive.

07:32.702 --> 07:36.002
This will give you
a view from the shuttle as they land.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.713
Would you like me
to get you the linkup?

07:39.709 --> 07:40.801
I'll get the linkup.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.816
<i>Twenty-five seconds
to re-entry interface.</i>

07:58.979 --> 08:01.107
<i>Flight controllers
will be closely watching...</i>

08:03.608 --> 08:04.734
<i>Maintain descent.</i>

08:08.405 --> 08:11.329
<i>Wind shear, this is minimum trajectory.</i>

08:13.076 --> 08:16.956
<i>Velocity at 2600 LBP.</i>

08:18.957 --> 08:23.258
<i>At 235 knots,
maintaining descent. At 220.</i>

08:23.420 --> 08:29.427
<i>Eight at 215, five at 210,
two at 200.</i>

08:31.386 --> 08:32.729
<i>One foot.</i>

08:32.886 --> 08:36.015
<i>Ground Control, this is Victory.
We are down.</i>

08:36.349 --> 08:39.443
He's breathing on his own.
His vital functions are good.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.652
As far as we can tell,
there has been no brain damage.

08:42.856 --> 08:47.157
It should only be a matter of time before
your husband regains consciousness.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.654
- So he's gonna be okay?
- Absolutely.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.083
And what about Alex?

08:54.951 --> 08:58.080
Captain Streck is an older man
than your husband.

08:58.246 --> 09:02.968
There was a tremendous strain
on his heart.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.677
Natalie.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.651
Jillian.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.452
Jillian.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.837
Hey.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.169
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:42.332 --> 09:45.711
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

09:55.470 --> 09:58.144
I missed you so much.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.652
How are you?

10:06.815 --> 10:08.817
- I'm all right.
- Yeah.

10:08.983 --> 10:12.032
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Good.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.913
I gotta pee.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.871
- I gotta pee.
- Yeah.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.335
I'll see what I can do for you.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.253
Where's Alex?

10:30.672 --> 10:32.549
Is he all right?

10:42.183 --> 10:44.106
Spencer.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.109
Spencer.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.860
Spencer, what is that?

10:56.531 --> 10:57.874
Did you feel that?

10:58.533 --> 11:00.035
- Alex.
- My God, what is that?

11:00.201 --> 11:01.748
Alex. Honey, I'm here.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.044
Goddamn it!

11:06.207 --> 11:08.255
- What can I do?
- Gonna need a change here.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.092
Alex!

11:11.421 --> 11:12.547
Jesus! Hold him.

11:18.261 --> 11:19.808
Help him!

11:20.013 --> 11:21.105
Epi.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.962
Essentially, he's still at zero.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.794
Nothing.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.088
- Charging, 300.
- Clear.

12:01.304 --> 12:02.806
Good job.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.440
- We got him.
- Clear.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.435
Hold off on that intubator.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.361
Stand by with some dopamine.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.988
Let's get an EKG prepped.

12:30.917 --> 12:31.964
What did you say?

12:32.126 --> 12:35.847
Well, I told that bloated
fast-food-eating motherfucker...

12:36.005 --> 12:39.350
we'd never have gotten to be heroes
if he hadn't cut our budget...

12:39.509 --> 12:43.184
and forced us to put that piece of shit
exploding satellite up in orbit.

12:43.346 --> 12:44.814
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.395
And then what happened?

12:46.599 --> 12:49.694
Aw, he said he'd never been talked to
like that before by anybody.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.322
I said I didn't give a rat's ass
and if he ever called me again...

12:53.481 --> 12:54.824
I would track him down...

12:54.983 --> 12:58.078
roust him out of his bunk,
pull his pants around his ankles...

12:58.236 --> 13:01.365
and spank him with a hanger
in front of his wife and children.

13:01.531 --> 13:04.876
- Well, that's real subtle.
- Yeah, I thought it would be subtle.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.537
Wanna tell me what you really said
to the President?

13:07.704 --> 13:08.830
Yeah.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.250
I thanked him for his call.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.669
Then I asked him
what he was wearing...

13:13.835 --> 13:18.341
and he started breathing kind of heavy,
made a funny noise and hung up.

13:18.506 --> 13:21.100
- What do you think that means?
- Maybe he's not into you.

13:21.259 --> 13:23.011
I guess not. Now, she got balloons.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.225
- Why didn't I get balloons?
- You got candy.

13:25.388 --> 13:27.732
- I didn't get no candy.
- You got candy.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.767
- Where's my candy?
- In the car.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.897
Does he ever talk about it?

13:34.772 --> 13:38.402
Did Spencer ever say anything
about what happened up there?

13:38.568 --> 13:41.162
What it was like
when they were alone?

13:43.031 --> 13:45.250
It's gonna be okay.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.167
They're back.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.789
He doesn't talk about it, does he?

13:52.415 --> 13:57.592
Neither does Alex.
Never mentions it, not a word.

13:58.421 --> 13:59.718
Well, do you blame them?

14:04.969 --> 14:07.438
Those two minutes,
they almost died, Jillian.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.441
- But they didn't.
- But they almost did.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.563
To go through that together,
to come back...

14:14.729 --> 14:17.278
and never talk about it,
never bring it up...

14:17.440 --> 14:18.487
it's bizarre.

14:19.817 --> 14:22.787
Natalie, it's over.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.285
Honey...

14:27.116 --> 14:29.494
I know this has to be hard
for you too.

14:30.953 --> 14:35.083
It just scares me
that they act like it never happened.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.182
- There you go.
- Thanks, commander.

14:43.341 --> 14:46.185
- You got it, buddy.
- Hey, Mike, what did he write?

14:46.344 --> 14:48.142
- Hey.
- Hm?

14:48.304 --> 14:51.148
- Guess what.
- What?

14:54.268 --> 14:56.646
I'm resigning from the service.

14:58.523 --> 15:03.745
- Because of what happened?
- No, it's because I'm done up there.

15:05.029 --> 15:11.833
I got an offer from an aerospace firm,
executive position.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.171
Lots of money.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.833
I mean, boatloads of money, Jill.

15:16.999 --> 15:20.048
What do you know about
being an executive?

15:20.253 --> 15:23.132
- You're a flier, Spence.
- No, honey.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.846
What I am is a true American hero.

15:26.008 --> 15:29.558
Now, the President of the United States
said that and you heard it.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.264
Yeah.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.687
Anyway

15:34.642 --> 15:36.565
it's pretty good for business...

15:36.769 --> 15:40.865
to have a true American hero
on the company letterhead, you know.

15:43.985 --> 15:47.535
The thing of it is, Jill...

15:47.697 --> 15:51.668
is that the company headquarters...

15:53.911 --> 15:56.039
it's in New York City.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.542
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.882
- New York?
- Yeah.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.762
- You hate New York.
- Yeah.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.891
- Too many people, remember?
- I know.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.389
We have a life here, Spencer.

16:13.723 --> 16:18.069
- My job, our friends, everything.
- Yeah.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.111
So, what do you say?

16:22.732 --> 16:24.450
Will you do it?

16:25.735 --> 16:27.408
Will you move to New York City
with me?

16:29.906 --> 16:31.624
Hm?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.578
You've always been there for me.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.582
I wanna be there for you.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.844
Let's go to New York.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.887
- Mrs. Armacost.
- Yes, Paula?

16:53.054 --> 16:56.399
When your husband is in space,
does he ever see God?

16:57.225 --> 16:59.603
What about aliens?
Does he see aliens?

16:59.769 --> 17:02.773
Does he bring a laser gun
in case there are aliens?

17:02.939 --> 17:04.612
I'd bring two laser guns...

17:04.773 --> 17:06.946
one for my pocket
and <i>a</i> laser rifle.

17:07.108 --> 17:10.454
Does your husband have a laser rifle?
Does he get to bring it home?

17:10.613 --> 17:12.741
Does it work here on Earth
or only in space?

17:14.116 --> 17:16.414
- You know what, Calvin?
- What, Mrs. Armacost?

17:17.118 --> 17:18.415
I'm going to miss you.

17:29.298 --> 17:34.395
Oh, no, no, no. No.

17:34.595 --> 17:38.691
<i>My friend, I'll say it clear</i>

17:40.476 --> 17:46.324
<i>I'll state my case
Of which I'm certain</i>

17:46.607 --> 17:51.613
<i>I've lived a life that's full</i>

17:51.779 --> 17:53.656
<i>I've traveled each</i>

17:53.823 --> 17:55.621
They ain't the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.785
<i>And every highway</i>

17:58.703 --> 18:03.504
<i>But more Much more than this</i>

18:03.666 --> 18:09.514
<i>He did it his way</i>

18:12.842 --> 18:16.972
<i>Regrets, I've had a few</i>

18:17.346 --> 18:23.149
<i>But then again, too few to mention</i>

18:23.311 --> 18:24.483
Here's to you.

18:24.645 --> 18:27.444
<i>I did what I had to do</i>

18:27.690 --> 18:28.816
Thank you.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.030
<i>I saw it through</i>

18:32.945 --> 18:34.572
Okay.

18:34.739 --> 18:38.039
<i>I planned each careful step</i>

18:39.368 --> 18:41.871
<i>Along the highway</i>

18:42.747 --> 18:45.091
<i>And more, much more</i>

18:45.249 --> 18:47.092
To you, spaceman.

18:47.543 --> 18:52.549
<i>I did it my way</i>

18:53.758 --> 18:58.229
<i>I've loved and been a snide</i>

18:58.387 --> 19:03.564
<i>I've had my fill...
My share of losing</i>

19:04.393 --> 19:08.739
<i>And now the tears subside</i>

19:11.067 --> 19:14.287
<i>I find it all so amusing</i>

19:14.987 --> 19:18.412
<i>Were times, I'm sure you knew</i>

19:19.784 --> 19:23.584
<i>When there was fuck
Fuck, fuck all else to do</i>

19:25.748 --> 19:29.378
<i>But through it all
When there was doubt</i>

19:30.753 --> 19:33.302
<i>I shot it up</i>

19:33.506 --> 19:35.099
Stop.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.521
<i>And the world</i>

19:42.056 --> 19:46.311
<i>And did it my way</i>

19:52.650 --> 19:54.072
<i>For what is a brat</i>

19:58.155 --> 20:02.001
<i>When he wears hats
And he cannot</i>

20:04.036 --> 20:06.334
<i>Say the things he truly</i>

20:06.580 --> 20:08.298
Spencer!

20:09.250 --> 20:13.096
Spencer!

20:16.173 --> 20:17.971
Spencer!

20:18.634 --> 20:19.681
Spencer!

20:20.803 --> 20:22.146
Spencer!

20:22.346 --> 20:23.689
<i>My Way</i>

20:26.559 --> 20:28.152
Alex!

20:35.651 --> 20:37.494
Baby

20:39.822 --> 20:41.369
Alex.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.193
I have a brief prepared statement...

21:10.352 --> 21:12.525
and then there will be time
for questions.

21:12.688 --> 21:16.534
Captain Alex Streck
died last night at 8:55.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.536
Cause of death has been determined
to have been a stroke...

21:19.695 --> 21:23.040
what the surgeons are calling
a severe insult to the brain.

21:23.199 --> 21:27.170
Alex was an asset to this program
way beyond his professional expertise.

21:27.328 --> 21:31.504
He will be missed terribly by all of us.
There will be a private ceremony.

21:33.626 --> 21:38.177
- Is Commander Armacost in any danger?
- I'll let Dr. Patraba answer that.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.393
Commander Armacost has been
through an array...

21:42.551 --> 21:44.519
of examinations and tests.

21:44.678 --> 21:47.056
It is the opinion of myself
and my colleagues...

21:47.223 --> 21:50.227
that he's in no more danger
than any of us.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.325
Hey.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.741
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

22:05.074 --> 22:07.452
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.379
- I'm gonna be over here, baby.
- Okay.

22:10.538 --> 22:13.291
- You okay?
- Yeah.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.630
- Where's Natalie?
- She's in the back.

22:15.793 --> 22:18.296
- She's been asking for you.
- Okay.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.214
- I'll see you in a bit.
- All right.

22:20.381 --> 22:21.883
Okay.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.571
Natalie?

22:41.277 --> 22:42.950
Jillian.

22:51.787 --> 22:54.506
They talked to him every night.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.127
All the time.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.804
I couldn't understand them.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.020
Who talked to him, Natalie?

23:13.309 --> 23:15.152
They did.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.324
They did, Jillian.

24:01.815 --> 24:04.489
He's hiding inside me.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.045
I certainly
do appreciate your concern...

24:22.211 --> 24:25.215
but I have been probed
and poked by enough needles.

24:25.381 --> 24:27.884
Your superiors have given me
a clean bill of health.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.052
I know that but, commander, I...

24:30.219 --> 24:31.562
It's probably nothing but...

24:31.720 --> 24:34.018
Do your bosses know you
wanna do this, Mr. Reese?

24:34.181 --> 24:35.228
No.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.359
- What, is there a storm?
- Strange.

24:52.241 --> 24:53.242
Oh, God!

24:56.745 --> 24:58.839
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh. My God!

24:59.331 --> 25:02.210
Oh, God. No. No.

25:02.376 --> 25:05.596
Oh, no. No.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.756
No!

25:20.936 --> 25:24.440
I'll be sure and let you know
of some good places for you to shop.

25:24.606 --> 25:28.110
That dress is really sweet
but it's not really appropriate.

25:28.986 --> 25:31.330
You'll meet all sorts
of interesting people here.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.911
They like the sort of things like I do.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.748
You feel the first kick
after the main engine sparks.

25:36.910 --> 25:40.414
But, you know, you're very lucky.
I...

25:41.123 --> 25:47.301
But then solid rocket boosters come on
and that's when you know...

25:47.463 --> 25:50.012
- That you're going somewhere real fast.
- Zoom, zoom, zoom.

25:50.174 --> 25:53.644
- That's right.
- I used to be into AIDS...

25:53.802 --> 25:55.930
but now I'm into hunger.

25:58.766 --> 26:03.146
- I teach.
- Oh, at the university?

26:03.312 --> 26:05.610
No, second grade.

26:05.773 --> 26:08.367
I'm sorry. I thought you said
you taught second grade.

26:08.525 --> 26:09.777
Yes. I...

26:09.943 --> 26:13.493
Oh. Ambrose, Hi. You look great. Yeah.

26:13.655 --> 26:16.329
- Will you excuse me?
- Yeah, sure.

26:33.634 --> 26:36.979
Yeah, all right. Excuse me, Phillip.

26:40.808 --> 26:42.481
Now, don't worry about her.

26:42.643 --> 26:46.193
Total lack of body fat has made her
something less than human.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.733
Don't think she's had
her period in three years...

26:48.941 --> 26:52.696
which I guess is a blessing
for the gene pool, wouldn't you say?

26:52.861 --> 26:55.364
- Shelly McLaren.
- Jillian Armacost

26:55.531 --> 26:57.374
Yeah, I know.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.043
Oh.

27:00.202 --> 27:03.832
- Your husband must be...
- Jackson McLaren.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.214
They all had cigars...

27:05.374 --> 27:08.548
but Jackson had
the biggest cigar of all.

27:08.710 --> 27:11.054
- Can I...? Thanks.
- Here we go.

27:14.007 --> 27:16.476
Do you have many friends here
in the city?

27:17.052 --> 27:20.682
Yeah, some, at work
and Spencer, of course.

27:20.848 --> 27:24.273
- What? Your husband and your friend?
- Yeah.

27:24.852 --> 27:26.604
You better not let that get around.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.613
You know, they're gonna
haul you up on charges.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.450
That I like.

27:32.609 --> 27:36.705
- What?
- Your laugh. That's an honest laugh.

27:36.864 --> 27:41.040
- It's been a while since I've heard one.
- Thank you.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.875
It's all right. I'll be right down.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.415
There's some minor disaster
in the kitchen...

27:46.582 --> 27:48.584
something to do
with burning rum balls.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.252
Now, I'm gonna call you...

27:50.419 --> 27:52.797
and we're gonna go out
and laugh, all right?

27:53.005 --> 27:54.882
- Okay.
- All right.

28:26.955 --> 28:29.549
- You all right?
- I'm drunk.

28:32.294 --> 28:34.592
Well, that's good, honey.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.094
That's good.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.813
Tell me what happened up there.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.654
Tell me.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.702
All right.

29:07.829 --> 29:11.003
- Come on, let's take a walk.
- Okay.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.648
You wanna know what happened?

29:33.021 --> 29:34.238
Yeah.

29:34.398 --> 29:36.025
Let me tell you.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.532
Yeah.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.499
You wanna know about them
two minutes?

29:45.534 --> 29:47.912
You never talk about it.

29:54.876 --> 29:56.844
Two minutes.

29:57.879 --> 29:59.631
Dark...

30:00.382 --> 30:02.055
black...

30:03.260 --> 30:05.058
no light.

30:07.180 --> 30:09.274
There was an explosion...

30:09.433 --> 30:14.439
and everything shut down.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.739
No light...

30:17.274 --> 30:19.402
no communication.

30:19.901 --> 30:23.747
It was black, silent.

30:25.741 --> 30:31.874
No sound but loud, something loud.
Loud nothing.

30:32.247 --> 30:35.296
And it was cold.
It was so cold, Jill.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.758
And I knew what that cold was.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.428
It was death.

30:43.550 --> 30:46.474
And it held me real tight
for about the first minute.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.305
And then...

30:50.724 --> 30:52.772
I felt warm.

30:53.435 --> 30:55.938
It was the warmth of your vagina...

30:56.438 --> 31:00.318
the warmth of your body,
your hands.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.954
The inside of your mouth...

31:04.446 --> 31:06.619
the warmth of your cunt...

31:06.782 --> 31:09.501
the warmth from inside you, Jillian.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.836
Your warmth.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.838
I felt it all around me.

31:18.126 --> 31:20.504
It made me breathe.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.855
It made me breathe.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.837
- Spencer.
- Jillian.

32:10.512 --> 32:12.014
Spencer.

32:13.515 --> 32:15.358
Spencer.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.865
No.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.779
Spencer!

32:35.036 --> 32:37.004
Spencer.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.546
What's happening?

32:42.586 --> 32:43.803
Spencer.

32:46.923 --> 32:48.925
What's happening?

33:56.368 --> 33:57.961
Spencer?

34:01.289 --> 34:02.415
What are you doing?

34:04.626 --> 34:07.505
I couldn't sleep, so I just...

34:08.463 --> 34:10.761
Listening to some music.

34:32.696 --> 34:35.165
I'm sorry if I was a bit rough.

34:35.991 --> 34:38.835
I guess maybe
I had a little too much to drink.

34:46.126 --> 34:48.049
Come on, let's go to bed.

35:06.146 --> 35:08.148
Goodnight, sweetheart.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.905
"She began to guess
the little man's name."

35:49.064 --> 35:51.783
'Is it Conrad Peppermill?' she said.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.906
"And the little man said..."

35:54.069 --> 35:56.743
No.

35:56.905 --> 36:00.250
"'I know, I know.
It's Sir William Doorknob.'

36:00.408 --> 36:02.376
And the little man said..."

36:02.535 --> 36:05.254
No.

36:05.413 --> 36:06.881
"'I have it."

36:07.040 --> 36:09.418
It must be little ribs of beef.'

36:09.584 --> 36:11.382
"And the little man said..."

36:11.544 --> 36:14.639
No.

36:15.090 --> 36:18.264
"'It couldn't be Rumpelstiltskin,
could it?'"

36:18.802 --> 36:21.225
'What did you say?' said the little man.

36:21.388 --> 36:26.986
- "I said it couldn't be...?" '
- Rumpelstiltskin.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.770
"And the little man screamed..."

36:30.939 --> 36:33.283
"And stamped his foot."

36:43.910 --> 36:46.288
<i>Honey, you sound so sad.</i>

36:46.454 --> 36:47.956
It's just the city, Nan.

36:49.624 --> 36:52.093
It just gets inside you, that's all.

36:52.252 --> 36:53.845
<i>You can't let it.</i>

36:54.045 --> 36:56.514
<i>That's how you got in trouble
after Mom and Dad died.</i>

36:56.673 --> 36:59.096
<i>And you sound like you did then.</i>

37:00.135 --> 37:02.684
<i>Have you found a doctor
to talk to yet?</i>

37:03.763 --> 37:06.186
Not yet.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.477
<i>Promise me something, okay?</i>

37:09.853 --> 37:13.153
<i>If it gets like it was before, you'll just...
You'll find someone to talk to.</i>

37:15.859 --> 37:18.988
Nan, I really have to go, okay?
Bye.

37:19.154 --> 37:21.703
- Hey, Jill.
- Hey.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.075
You're late.

37:24.826 --> 37:28.330
You didn't get my message?
I had a dinner meeting tonight.

37:28.496 --> 37:31.045
- No. I didn't check the machine yet.
- Oh.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.629
Yeah, I'm sorry.

37:32.792 --> 37:36.217
I still ain't conquered this
corporate shit yet.

37:36.379 --> 37:40.100
- I'm gonna take a shower, honey.
- Okay.

38:42.570 --> 38:45.915
Do you ever think
what if I had an F-15 in World War ll...

38:46.074 --> 38:48.918
- Or a B-17 in World War I?
- No, never.

38:49.077 --> 38:52.126
What kind of ass I could kick if I had
that type of technology?

38:52.288 --> 38:55.087
And how many different kinds
of ass are there, Jackson?

38:55.250 --> 38:56.877
Many kinds, love.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.592
But the modern battlefield
is all electronic...

38:59.754 --> 39:02.758
and the fighter that this man
helped us design can detect...

39:02.924 --> 39:06.554
sort, identify and eliminate
anything electronic.

39:06.719 --> 39:11.441
You got two McLaren engines
pumping 25,000 pounds of thrust...

39:12.183 --> 39:13.730
wingspan of 75 feet.

39:13.893 --> 39:16.988
- Fully extended.
- Yeah, that's fully extended.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.657
You got a top speed
of 1800 miles per hour...

39:19.816 --> 39:24.697
a ceiling of 55,000 feet
and a crew of two.

39:25.280 --> 39:30.161
The modern battlefield is a blizzard,
a transparent, electronic blizzard...

39:30.326 --> 39:34.081
with planes and tanks
and computers and missiles...

39:34.247 --> 39:38.502
all humming away
and into that storm flies our fighter.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.839
It doesn't drop bombs.
It doesn't shoot missiles.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.133
It just sends out a signal.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.134
It's like the voice of God.

39:46.301 --> 39:49.225
It's just a signal
that turns everything off.

39:49.721 --> 39:50.973
I forget, Jackson.

39:51.139 --> 39:54.985
Who is the enemy now that we need
your plane to defend us from?

39:55.143 --> 39:56.816
The enemy at this moment?

39:56.978 --> 39:58.855
- You are, dear. You are.
- Ha, ha.

40:00.481 --> 40:04.361
The signal it makes,
what does it sound like?

40:04.527 --> 40:08.828
Humans can't hear it, dove.
Humans can't hear it at all.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.830
Excuse me.
Miss Augusta would like to see you.

40:11.993 --> 40:13.620
Oh, all right. Come on, Jackson.

40:13.786 --> 40:15.788
Augusta has summoned us
to her bedside.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.457
It's the goodnight kiss.

40:18.458 --> 40:22.383
After allowance,
it's the most important event of the day.

40:22.545 --> 40:23.888
The joys of parenthood.

40:24.047 --> 40:26.971
- Come on, Jackson.
- Coming.

40:48.863 --> 40:51.082
Why are you so far away?

40:51.282 --> 40:53.034
I'm right here.

40:53.409 --> 40:55.207
What's the matter?

40:55.662 --> 40:59.883
- What's wrong?
- I don't understand any of this.

41:00.375 --> 41:03.379
What they're talking about,
it's like they're speaking in code.

41:03.544 --> 41:06.514
Honey, it's business, that's all.

41:06.673 --> 41:09.096
Why do you have to build that plane?

41:09.300 --> 41:12.895
The way you talk about it,
it doesn't even sound like you.

41:13.054 --> 41:15.227
Baby, it's my lob...

41:15.390 --> 41:17.063
My job.

41:18.226 --> 41:21.196
You used to say you'd fly forever.

41:21.854 --> 41:25.233
You used to say
they'd have to bury you in the sky.

41:26.734 --> 41:29.203
Yeah. They almost did.

41:36.244 --> 41:39.373
What are you looking for
when you look at me like that?

41:39.539 --> 41:41.758
What are you hiding from me?

41:46.754 --> 41:48.597
Nothing.

41:50.258 --> 41:52.056
Nothing.

41:59.934 --> 42:03.063
- No.
- Yeah.

42:04.981 --> 42:06.073
- Yeah.
- No.

42:06.232 --> 42:07.449
Yeah.

42:10.653 --> 42:13.782
This is going to be a little cold.

42:18.119 --> 42:20.963
Let's have a look in here, shall we?

42:23.291 --> 42:25.635
There it is.

42:26.002 --> 42:27.128
Let's take a measurement.

42:30.757 --> 42:35.183
Nine weeks, give or take a few days.

42:35.386 --> 42:38.981
See this here? This flickering?

42:39.140 --> 42:41.313
- What is that?
- That's the heartbeat.

42:46.481 --> 42:51.954
- Is it supposed to be moving that fast?
- I would be worried if it were not.

42:52.320 --> 42:55.164
Everything looks fine, Jillian.

42:58.785 --> 43:00.958
Well, that's interesting.

43:01.829 --> 43:03.627
What?

43:03.790 --> 43:06.339
Well, wait. I'm not sure.

43:11.297 --> 43:12.674
See this here?

43:13.466 --> 43:16.515
- What is that?
- A second heartbeat.

43:16.677 --> 43:19.021
Two heartbeats.

43:20.056 --> 43:23.526
It's twins, Mrs. Armacost. Twins.

43:28.481 --> 43:32.156
This is a number of a support group...

43:32.318 --> 43:35.663
for women who are expecting twins.

43:38.199 --> 43:41.999
There's something
I didn't tell you from my chart.

43:43.663 --> 43:45.586
I know I should've but...

43:47.041 --> 43:52.844
A few years ago,
after my parents died, I...

43:56.050 --> 43:57.848
I had a bad time.

43:59.262 --> 44:00.388
How bad, Jillian?

44:04.100 --> 44:06.694
I would see people I knew.

44:08.855 --> 44:10.232
I would see them dead.

44:11.774 --> 44:13.902
And sometimes, I...

44:15.695 --> 44:17.538
I would see myself.

44:21.909 --> 44:24.253
Did you seek treatment?

44:25.246 --> 44:27.590
Were you hospitalized?

44:29.542 --> 44:31.260
Yes.

44:36.924 --> 44:38.267
Does he know?

44:40.303 --> 44:42.101
He's the one that got me through it.

44:43.014 --> 44:45.392
You are afraid...

44:45.558 --> 44:48.937
that this pregnancy
is going to bring all that back, right?

44:49.103 --> 44:51.151
Yeah.

44:52.273 --> 44:55.777
Spend time with Spencer.
Go through this together.

44:56.277 --> 44:59.281
Now that you know that
these feelings you've been having...

44:59.447 --> 45:01.449
are caused by the life
growing in you...

45:01.616 --> 45:06.167
and by your body adapting to it,
oh, cherish it.

45:06.329 --> 45:07.421
Okay.

45:07.580 --> 45:11.676
And if you need, call me any time,
day or night.

45:12.251 --> 45:13.969
Thank you.

45:43.324 --> 45:45.167
Just a nightmare, baby.

45:46.661 --> 45:49.005
You were talking in your sleep.

45:51.165 --> 45:54.465
- What was I saying?
- Couldn't tell.

45:54.627 --> 45:57.050
It didn't sound like words, really.

45:57.213 --> 45:58.715
It was more like sounds.

46:00.174 --> 46:01.676
I'm scared.

46:03.970 --> 46:07.520
Well, I think it'd be strange...

46:07.682 --> 46:10.356
if a first-time mother
wasn't scared, honey.

46:11.644 --> 46:13.396
Yeah.

46:16.232 --> 46:18.655
Come on. Come with me.

46:22.029 --> 46:23.497
There you go.

46:23.656 --> 46:24.999
That's better, ain't it?

46:25.700 --> 46:28.544
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

46:33.165 --> 46:36.544
Everything's gonna be okay, isn't it?

46:38.254 --> 46:40.677
Everything's gonna be
just fine, honey.

46:41.841 --> 46:45.061
And they're gonna be healthy, right?

46:45.886 --> 46:49.060
And they'll be beautiful,
just like their mother.

46:52.059 --> 46:54.357
What do you think they'll be
when they grow up?

46:54.520 --> 46:57.273
- What are they gonna be'?
- Yeah.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.863
Shit, they're gonna be pilots, honey.

47:00.860 --> 47:04.581
- Just like their father.
- Just like their father.

47:06.157 --> 47:09.878
All right, lean back here.
Let me wash your hair.

47:17.752 --> 47:19.550
Am I dreaming, Spencer?

47:22.048 --> 47:23.925
No.

47:26.761 --> 47:28.388
No, you're not dreaming.

47:32.308 --> 47:34.151
And then he gives you that look...

47:34.310 --> 47:37.610
you know,
that "honey, I understand" look. Ha.

47:37.813 --> 47:40.282
I don't care how long
he rubs my feet for.

47:40.441 --> 47:42.114
He doesn't understand a thing.

47:42.276 --> 47:45.997
- He rubs your feet?
- I know what you mean.

47:46.197 --> 47:48.620
We're supposed to be going
through this together...

47:48.783 --> 47:51.627
but I have never felt
more separate from him.

47:51.786 --> 47:56.166
It's like there's something going on
in my body he knows nothing about.

47:56.332 --> 47:57.925
He rubs your feet?

48:00.628 --> 48:02.301
I got into the bathtub
with my socks on.

49:25.045 --> 49:26.718
Oh, my God.

49:28.924 --> 49:31.302
Jesus, you scared me.

49:35.055 --> 49:38.434
You are in big trouble.

49:39.018 --> 49:40.235
Do you like the pie?

49:41.395 --> 49:44.069
I don't believe I can take
much more of this, honey.

49:44.231 --> 49:47.610
How much do you like the pie?

49:47.860 --> 49:51.865
- Come get the pie.
- First, I'm gonna drink you...

49:52.031 --> 49:54.409
- Then I'm gonna eat you.
- Get the pie.

49:54.575 --> 49:57.795
- Want me to eat that, right?
- Yeah.

49:57.953 --> 49:59.751
- Think you can handle all of us?
- Yep.

49:59.914 --> 50:00.961
- Yeah?
- Yep.

50:01.123 --> 50:02.545
- Love the belly?
- I love it.

50:02.708 --> 50:04.756
Good, I love the belly too.

50:13.469 --> 50:15.437
Excuse me.

50:24.271 --> 50:25.864
Mrs. Armacost...

50:26.607 --> 50:28.405
do you...?

50:28.609 --> 50:29.610
Do you remember me?

50:31.987 --> 50:35.491
- Mr. Reese?
- Yes.

50:42.248 --> 50:43.966
- How many months?
- Just a few.

50:45.084 --> 50:47.257
I need to speak with you.

50:47.419 --> 50:50.138
Spencer works for McLaren now
if you're looking for him.

50:50.297 --> 50:55.474
No, I need to speak with you,
Mrs. Armacost.

50:57.137 --> 50:59.356
About those two minutes.

50:59.515 --> 51:02.485
The two minutes, Mrs. Armacost.

51:02.643 --> 51:04.645
What is it, Mr. Reese?

51:05.312 --> 51:09.033
Noticed any change in your husband's
behavior since the shuttle mission?

51:09.191 --> 51:12.821
I've been through these files
and there are some peculiarities.

51:12.987 --> 51:14.489
Like right here.

51:14.655 --> 51:17.283
Your husband's signature
before the shuttle.

51:17.449 --> 51:19.201
Here's a form signed
when he returned.

51:19.410 --> 51:25.463
Now, they are similar but not the same.
Not the same signature.

51:25.624 --> 51:28.798
Mr. Reese, are you in New York
on official NASA business?

51:28.961 --> 51:31.180
And here's the results
of the medical tests...

51:31.338 --> 51:33.215
- We ran when he got back.
- Mr. Reese.

51:35.843 --> 51:38.642
- Are you on official NASA business?
- Everything is fine.

51:38.804 --> 51:40.351
Everything shows up normal...

51:40.514 --> 51:42.562
but everything's a bit different.

51:42.725 --> 51:45.148
Blood levels, temperature,
EKG, EEG.

51:45.311 --> 51:47.860
Everything's just a little bit off
from what it was.

51:48.022 --> 51:50.525
- I mean, look at this.
- Mr. Reese.

51:50.691 --> 51:52.364
Does NASA know you're here?

51:53.193 --> 51:54.695
Oh.

51:54.862 --> 51:59.868
They wouldn't listen.
They terminated my employment.

52:03.329 --> 52:05.172
- I have to go now.
- No.

52:05.331 --> 52:09.552
If you have anything to say,
you can call my husband at McLaren.

52:10.544 --> 52:13.013
I showed them facts.
They terminated my employment.

52:13.172 --> 52:15.550
They referred me to a psychiatrist.

52:15.716 --> 52:17.844
Don't follow me.

52:18.886 --> 52:20.559
I've seen Streck's autopsy report.

52:20.721 --> 52:24.396
It was a stroke. His system overloaded.
His body couldn't stand the strain.

52:24.558 --> 52:27.732
I've seen Natalie Streck's autopsy
report <i>as</i> well.

52:30.064 --> 52:31.532
That was a suicide.

52:31.690 --> 52:34.534
- She killed herself. I was there. I saw it.
- Yeah, she did.

52:34.693 --> 52:38.618
According to the report, when she killed
herself she was three weeks pregnant.

52:39.615 --> 52:40.912
What did you say?

52:41.075 --> 52:43.794
She conceived right after her husband
left the hospital.

52:43.994 --> 52:46.247
She was pregnant, Mrs. Armacost.

52:46.747 --> 52:48.920
So, what happened
during those two minutes...

52:49.083 --> 52:50.926
when they were alone,
what happened?

52:51.085 --> 52:54.089
The suits your husband and
Streck wore had built-in recorders.

52:54.254 --> 52:57.383
Something happened out there
that scared the shit out of them.

52:57.549 --> 53:00.268
- What could do that?
- No.

53:00.427 --> 53:02.145
It was an accident, an explosion.

53:02.304 --> 53:04.557
- The satellite...
- They train for explosions.

53:04.723 --> 53:07.101
They train for accidents.
They trained for hours.

53:07.267 --> 53:09.941
They have a plan. They don't panic.
They don't deviate.

53:10.104 --> 53:11.947
Stick to the plan.
That's what they do.

53:12.106 --> 53:16.327
Something happened out there
that these two men had not trained for.

53:16.527 --> 53:19.246
What would do that
to two highly trained astronauts?

53:19.405 --> 53:20.657
Scare them like that?

53:20.823 --> 53:23.622
Can you swear to me
that he's still your husband? Can you?

53:25.536 --> 53:29.291
- Let go of me, Mr. Reese.
- Ma'am, is this man bothering you?

53:32.126 --> 53:34.800
Yes. Yes, he is.

53:35.546 --> 53:38.345
You know, don't you?
You already know.

53:38.549 --> 53:39.971
- Okay.
- Room 304...

53:40.134 --> 53:42.853
Nesbit Arms, Mrs. Armacost.
Please, Mrs. Armacost!

53:44.972 --> 53:48.146
Okay. Settle down. Just settle down.

53:52.438 --> 53:55.487
<i>I'm gonna
rotate the panel 48 degrees. You got me?</i>

53:55.649 --> 53:58.528
<i>Spencer, what is that? Did you feel that?</i>

53:58.694 --> 53:59.820
<i>Spencer, what is that?</i>

54:03.866 --> 54:07.666
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ!
What the hell is that?</i>

54:13.292 --> 54:17.672
No, no. No, no.

54:43.697 --> 54:46.200
I'm looking
for the pregnant woman in 24-F.

54:46.366 --> 54:47.367
Yeah.

54:49.036 --> 54:50.629
Jillian, what's wrong?

54:52.706 --> 54:55.585
He said she must have gotten
pregnant...

54:55.751 --> 54:57.549
right after Alex got back.

54:58.128 --> 55:02.099
- Did he say anything else?
- Oh, God, Nan.

55:02.257 --> 55:05.852
Oh, honey, the last thing
you need to worry about is that freak.

55:06.011 --> 55:09.732
- I mean, just have Spencer call someone.
- No, Nan.

55:11.725 --> 55:13.443
Spencer can't know about this.

55:13.644 --> 55:15.567
But Jillian, you said he looked crazy.

55:16.271 --> 55:21.243
You have to promise me
you won't tell Spencer.

55:21.401 --> 55:22.903
Please promise me.

55:23.070 --> 55:26.574
You can't keep these things
bottled inside you, Jillian.

55:28.575 --> 55:30.248
You're right.

55:34.248 --> 55:35.591
Okay.

55:35.749 --> 55:38.093
If he bothers me again...

55:38.877 --> 55:42.598
I'll tell Spencer, okay? Deal?

55:45.592 --> 55:47.970
- Sure.
- Okay.

55:48.178 --> 55:51.398
- Mr. Armacost, your table's ready.
- Oh, great. All right.

55:51.557 --> 55:53.059
- Let's go sit down.
- Yeah.

55:55.602 --> 55:56.649
Oh, Stan?

55:56.812 --> 55:59.440
This year's grand marshal
at the parade of losers?

55:59.606 --> 56:03.156
He's gone. We can't all be as lucky
as Jill here.

56:03.318 --> 56:06.117
Oh, no. It's me that's lucky.

56:11.243 --> 56:14.087
You all right, honey?
What's the matter?

56:15.914 --> 56:18.008
What's the matter, honey?
You all right?

56:18.959 --> 56:20.427
I'm just a little hot.

56:23.422 --> 56:24.924
You should have some water.

56:28.635 --> 56:30.512
I think I wanna go home.

56:42.482 --> 56:44.155
All right.

57:16.683 --> 57:18.310
Feeling better?

57:20.395 --> 57:22.147
Yeah.

57:25.859 --> 57:28.658
- Where's Nan?
- She went out.

57:28.820 --> 57:30.914
It's after midnight.

57:31.990 --> 57:34.664
She's young, Jill.
She's having fun.

57:36.536 --> 57:39.540
Don't you remember
when we used to have fun?

57:42.584 --> 57:43.801
No.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.217
No.

57:47.381 --> 57:49.509
You don't remember that?

57:50.884 --> 57:52.727
Okay.

57:55.097 --> 57:56.690
All right.

57:57.391 --> 57:59.564
What's wrong with you?

57:59.935 --> 58:02.188
You ever think
about what happened to Alex?

58:02.354 --> 58:03.776
Oh, shit.

58:03.939 --> 58:05.737
What happened to Natalie?

58:09.736 --> 58:12.364
I do, all the time.

58:13.073 --> 58:16.077
Those two minutes,
you could have died.

58:17.744 --> 58:20.213
Why do you wanna go back there?

58:20.872 --> 58:23.091
Why do you wanna
go back to that?

58:24.918 --> 58:29.264
Can't you just try for once to be happy?
Just once?

58:45.230 --> 58:47.653
I'm gonna go to sleep.

59:05.625 --> 59:07.923
- Mr. Reese?
- Yes.

59:08.086 --> 59:10.134
It's Jillian Armacost.

59:10.297 --> 59:16.054
The autopsy on Natalie Streck,
what did it say about the baby?

59:17.637 --> 59:18.889
Mr. Reese?

59:19.056 --> 59:20.774
<i>Not on the phone, Mrs. Armacost.</i>

59:20.932 --> 59:23.651
No, you don't understand.
You have to tell me.

59:23.852 --> 59:26.947
What did Natalie's autopsy say
about the baby?

59:27.105 --> 59:29.073
<i>Babies.</i>

59:32.611 --> 59:33.828
What?

59:33.987 --> 59:38.663
<i>Natalie Streck was pregnant with twins,
Mrs. Armacost.</i>

59:41.536 --> 59:43.538
Oh, my God.

59:45.457 --> 59:49.212
<i>- What's happening to me?
- You are too, aren't you?</i>

59:49.961 --> 59:51.963
<i>Mrs. Armacost.</i>

59:52.422 --> 59:54.015
<i>Pregnant with his twins?</i>

59:56.218 --> 59:58.846
Natalie's babies...

59:59.805 --> 01:00:01.807
Mr. Reese...

01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:04.810
what did the autopsy
say about them?

01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:09.022
<i>There's something
I need to show you, Mrs. Armacost.</i>

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:11.942
<i>Something you need to see.</i>

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:15.283
Do you know the story
of the princess...

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:18.665
whose beloved prince
dies in battle?

01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:22.586
<i>Mrs. Armacost,
I have something you need to see.</i>

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.919
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:33.047
The enemy prince...

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:37.138
after overrunning the castle...

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:43.106
finds the princess
and forces himself upon her.

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:49.563
Months later,
the princess is with child.

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:53.985
But whose?

01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:59.956
It's either the child of her enemy...

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:03.998
the man that killed her husband...

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.543
the man that raped her...

01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:15.013
in which case,
she'll kill herself and the child...

01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:20.807
or it's the child of her prince.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.059
The only thing she has left of him.

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:32.065
A part of him still alive within her...

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:35.400
kept safe inside her...

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:40.289
in which case...

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:47.621
But how would she know
until it was too late?

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.544
How will she know
until the child is born...

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:56.429
and she can see its eyes?

01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:01.848
<i>Meet me right now.</i>

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:03.603
<i>Somewhere public.</i>

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:06.561
<i>Leave your apartment.
Meet me now.</i>

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:33.459
Sherman Reese.

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:35.377
Mr. Reese.

01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:37.420
Sherman Reese.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.385
I thought that was you.

01:02:43.218 --> 01:02:45.971
I was standing over
across the street...

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:50.024
and I said to myself,
"Now, is that Sherman Reese?"

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:52.857
- Nice to see you.
- Commander Armacost.

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:54.066
Yeah.

01:02:54.229 --> 01:03:00.032
- Are you in town on official business?
- I'm not with NASA anymore.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:04.493
You know what?
You know what? I heard that.

01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:07.375
I heard and I thought
it was one of them agency rumors.

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:10.169
Well, listen...

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:12.839
if you need a recommendation...

01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:15.092
don't hesitate
because I can help you.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:18.800
- Well, I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:21.761
It's real weird running into you...

01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:25.768
because the thing of it is,
I was just thinking about you.

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:29.773
I was thinking about them tests
you wanted to run on me...

01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:31.558
you know, after Alex died.

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:33.352
If you got a couple of minutes...

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:35.612
we can have a cup of coffee
or something.

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:38.944
- Actually, I gotta...
- Oh, no, come on, now, Sherman.

01:03:39.107 --> 01:03:40.859
You're a man of leisure.

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:43.495
You ain't got nothing but time,
do you?

01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:45.702
Come on.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.117
Yeah, it's nice to see you.

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:08.307
Almost forgot your satchel,
Mr. Reese.

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:10.268
I got it.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.676
You were the only one
who knew, Nan.

01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:47.638
- I asked you not to tell him.
- I didn't, okay?

01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:50.224
What were you talking about
when I was sleeping?

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:52.185
- We were just talking.
- About what?

01:04:52.347 --> 01:04:56.318
Just talking. Look, don't do this.
It's not good for you.

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:58.274
Where did you go last night?

01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:00.780
- Will you listen to yourself?
- Where did you go?

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:02.987
I love you, okay?
And Spencer loves you.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:04.822
We all do so much.

01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:07.737
Spencer was there.

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:11.788
Nan, Spencer was there
with Reese...

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:14.499
and you were the only one
who knew, Nan.

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:17.130
How did he know
unless you told him?

01:05:17.288 --> 01:05:19.882
You promised me!

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:24.838
Jillian, I love you,
but I'm not gonna do this with you.

01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:33.142
Do what with me?

01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:34.476
Come back, Nan.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:38.021
Nan, come back!

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:41.438
Don't leave, Nan!

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:46.947
Shit!

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:13.770
<i>- Hello, Nesbit</i> Arms.
- Mr. Reese in Room 304.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:27.071
<i>There's no answer in Room 304.</i>

01:06:29.944 --> 01:06:32.413
Down <i>came</i> the rain

01:06:32.572 --> 01:06:35.496
<i>And washed the spider out</i>

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:42.003
<i>Out came the sun
And dried up all the rain</i>

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:48.923
<i>And the itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the spout again</i>

01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:27.538
Are you okay?

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:42.595
<i>It's like a joke, right?</i>

01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:47.518
<i>But if you are watching this tape,
I didn't get to that meeting.</i>

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:50.107
<i>If you are watching this tape,
Mrs. Armacost...</i>

01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:52.567
<i>I'm probably fucking dead!</i>

01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:56.868
<i>This is my backup.
That's what they taught us at NASA.</i>

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.529
<i>Always have a backup system.</i>

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:03.576
<i>I'm not crazy. I wish I was.</i>

01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:07.837
<i>I prayed I was. I know I'm not.</i>

01:10:07.995 --> 01:10:10.043
<i>You might think you're crazy.</i>

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:12.667
<i>How could you not?</i>

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:20.675
<i>Always have a backup.</i>

01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:23.641
<i>You're gonna hear two voices
on this tape.</i>

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:28.020
<i>One is your husband's
and the other Captain Streck.</i>

01:10:29.934 --> 01:10:34.189
<i>- I'm gonna rotate the pane/...
- This line is your husband's voice.</i>

01:10:34.355 --> 01:10:36.198
<i>This line is Captain Streck's.</i>

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:38.155
<i>- What is that?
- What the fuck?</i>

01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:41.617
<i>Jesus Christ! What the hell is that?</i>

01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:43.873
<i>Two voices, but three lines.</i>

01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:45.954
<i>There's something else on the tape.</i>

01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:51.294
<i>Something beyond our range of hearing,
but I translated it.</i>

01:10:51.456 --> 01:10:56.087
<i>I had to hear it and this...</i>

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.968
<i>is what it sounds like.</i>

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.773
<i>NASA said that it's static...</i>

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:13.982
It's not static.

01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:16.736
<i>Caused by the explosion
of the satellite.</i>

01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:19.447
<i>Static buildup in their suits, but it's not.
I tracked it.</i>

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:21.737
<i>- It is not static.
- Not static.</i>

01:11:21.903 --> 01:11:26.124
<i>It's not from their suits,
it's not from the shuttle. It's not...</i>

01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:30.666
<i>It's not from Earth, either.</i>

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:35.174
<i>Two minutes, that's all there is.
That's all it took.</i>

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:36.801
<i>If you wanted to come here...</i>

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:39.178
<i>from very, very far away...</i>

01:11:39.337 --> 01:11:42.841
<i>maybe you wouldn't have
to travel in a ship.</i>

01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:45.476
<i>Maybe you could travel
in a transmission...</i>

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:48.013
<i>at the speed of light, like a thought.</i>

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:53.770
<i>Just wait for two of us to be up there.</i>

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:58.357
<i>Two of us in orbit, near a target.</i>

01:11:58.523 --> 01:12:00.571
<i>Something to aim at, like the satellite.</i>

01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:05.830
<i>Two of us beyond suspicion.
Heroes, all-Americans.</i>

01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:08.457
<i>Wait for them...</i>

01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:14.043
<i>then erase them like a tape
and record your own message.</i>

01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:19.218
<i>He's not your husband anymore.</i>

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:20.754
<i>He's not.</i>

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.467
What?

01:12:23.798 --> 01:12:26.301
<i>The computer that runs this airplane,
it's not there.</i>

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:29.346
<i>Hasn't been designed yet,
but it's supposed to go here...</i>

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:33.983
<i>in the cockpit right where the pilots
are supposed to be.</i>

01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:40.691
<i>Two computers
that work off each other...</i>

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:43.952
<i>that feed off each other.</i>

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:45.862
<i>Twins.</i>

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:48.577
<i>Twin computers.</i>

01:12:49.407 --> 01:12:51.660
<i>Twins, Mrs. Armacost.</i>

01:12:51.826 --> 01:12:54.750
<i>What do you think
you have inside of you?</i>

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:58.041
<i>What do you think he put there?</i>

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.960
What are they gonna be?
They're gonna be pilots, honey.

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:05.514
Just like their father.

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:10.390
Hey, Jill.

01:13:13.848 --> 01:13:14.974
Hey.

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:18.235
- Did I scare you?
- I didn't hear you come in.

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:20.192
Oh.

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:24.530
Listen, I came home
because I felt bad for you...

01:13:24.692 --> 01:13:27.070
getting into that fight with Nan,
you know.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.118
Why don't you tell me
what it was about?

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.538
Just sister stuff.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.577
Have you heard from her?

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:39.173
- No.
- Well...

01:13:39.707 --> 01:13:41.755
I'm sure she'll call you.

01:13:45.379 --> 01:13:47.097
You're trembling.

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:52.645
I am?

01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:56.065
I'm a little cold.

01:13:59.977 --> 01:14:01.069
You know what I did?

01:14:01.228 --> 01:14:05.950
I brought something home
I believe is gonna cheer you right up.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.073
What do you think?

01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:10.913
Pop it in.

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:16.210
Oh.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:19.797
Were you watching something?

01:14:21.749 --> 01:14:25.128
Yeah, It's a...

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.763
It's a pregnancy video.

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:29.427
Oh.

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:34.391
Well, maybe
we should watch it together.

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:37.895
No.

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:42.020
Let's watch the movie.

01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:46.862
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:50.407
All right.

01:14:52.697 --> 01:14:55.041
Why are you building that plane?

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:57.793
- What's that?
- Why do you have to build that plane?

01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:01.130
It's a contract, Jill.

01:15:01.288 --> 01:15:04.918
And besides, I didn't add
half as much as Jackson said I did.

01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:08.554
They got some real sharp engineers
over there.

01:15:08.713 --> 01:15:11.307
Come here. Move on back here.

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:15.052
I love you.

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:27.816
I know what you're thinking.

01:15:30.234 --> 01:15:31.702
Don't you worry.

01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:36.499
Everything's gonna be just fine.

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:27.375
Yeah, these pesky goddamn satellites.

01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:30.795
I'm gonna rotate the panel
48 degrees. You got me Alex?

01:16:30.961 --> 01:16:32.463
Spencer, what is that?

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:33.677
Did you feel that?

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:35.716
Spencer, what is that?

01:16:35.883 --> 01:16:37.851
- What the fuck?
- Jesus Christ!

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:40.479
What the hell is that?

01:16:56.987 --> 01:16:59.160
Must have dozed off.

01:17:00.574 --> 01:17:03.703
- Were you dreaming?
- Hm?

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:07.669
No. Just sleeping.

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:11.043
You weren't dreaming?

01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:16.432
No, Jill, I wasn't dreaming.

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:22.305
Were you?

01:17:26.267 --> 01:17:28.986
My caterer gets them
from the French Caribbean.

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:33.446
I think the French are more advanced
in this way. Don't you think?

01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:40.453
Now, listen,
with these, all sales are final.

01:17:41.532 --> 01:17:44.001
Are you sure this is the way
you wanna go?

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:54.132
Yeah.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:59.509
Now, when you get home,
you take both pills and then go to bed.

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:01.927
It's gonna be a bit of vile cramping...

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:05.098
but as soon as you start spotting,
it goes real fast.

01:18:06.307 --> 01:18:07.524
And Spencer won't know?

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:10.778
If he's like the rest,
he'll think you had a miscarriage...

01:18:10.936 --> 01:18:12.984
and he'll go out
and buy you a bracelet.

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:23.742
Now, don't beat yourself up
about this, sweetheart.

01:18:25.159 --> 01:18:29.130
I mean, it's not as if
any of this means anything.

01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:42.723
There's a little bit of pain
and then it's over.

01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:49.483
Oh, God. I can't.

01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:51.360
Oh, God.

01:18:52.937 --> 01:18:54.405
I can't do it.

01:18:55.522 --> 01:18:58.526
It's gonna be really bad.

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:03.994
I'm so sorry.

01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:07.376
You'll understand.

01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:09.920
I have to.

01:19:11.872 --> 01:19:13.419
Okay.

01:19:13.999 --> 01:19:18.755
Just a little bit of pain...

01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:22.887
and then it's over.

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:26.311
Yeah.

01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:28.681
Okay.

01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:33.645
They're just babies.

01:19:33.811 --> 01:19:36.360
I can't do it. Oh, God.

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:38.741
I can't do it.

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:41.026
Oh, help me!

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:46.661
No. Don't do that.

01:19:49.994 --> 01:19:51.291
Oh, God.

01:19:52.413 --> 01:19:53.881
Oh!

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:55.507
<i>Oh, God. Stop it.</i>

01:19:56.333 --> 01:19:59.132
He's gonna... Oh, God.

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:02.799
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.858
Oh, God, no.

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:18.360
- What were you gonna do to them?
- No.

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:20.195
No.

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:24.786
No, you heard them. Oh, God.

01:20:24.945 --> 01:20:27.243
What were you gonna do?

01:20:28.949 --> 01:20:30.292
Nothing.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:34.170
No. No!

01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:41.504
No. No. No.

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:54.521
Jill, please.

01:20:57.936 --> 01:21:00.234
Let's just calm down
and talk about this, okay?

01:21:02.316 --> 01:21:03.408
No.

01:21:07.821 --> 01:21:09.789
Come on, now, honey.

01:21:18.248 --> 01:21:21.627
Where you gonna go, Jill?

01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:23.963
Where are you gonna go?

01:22:25.983 --> 01:22:28.953
Don't talk.

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:31.239
Don't say a word, honey.

01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:32.657
You're fine.

01:22:32.823 --> 01:22:34.621
You're fine now.

01:22:37.828 --> 01:22:40.331
They're still inside you, Jill.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:42.917
They're right where
they need to be...

01:22:43.083 --> 01:22:46.303
and we're not ever gonna mention
what you tried to do.

01:22:46.879 --> 01:22:49.132
What you tried to do
with them pills, okay?

01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:51.391
Doesn't exist.

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.393
Never happened, Jillian.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:59.396
- Spencer...
- I don't want to hear a peep out of you.

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:01.815
You hear me?

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:05.440
I love you so much.

01:23:06.273 --> 01:23:09.777
I don't know what I'd do if anything
happened to you or the babies.

01:23:11.278 --> 01:23:16.205
Now, you just keep quiet
and you rest.

01:23:16.366 --> 01:23:17.913
I'm here with you.

01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:23.959
I'm always gonna be here, Jill. Always.

01:23:28.545 --> 01:23:30.138
You sleep.

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:33.266
Good girl.

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:54.162
- Nan.
- Hey, Jilly. Hi. Hi.

01:23:57.074 --> 01:23:59.623
I don't wanna fight with you, Jilly.

01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:02.584
There's something wrong, Nan.

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:06.300
There's not.
Doctor says you can go home any day.

01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:12.465
No. Something's wrong
with Spencer and the twins.

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:15.137
- Hey, it's just this place.
- No.

01:24:16.426 --> 01:24:18.349
He did something to me, Nan...

01:24:19.346 --> 01:24:21.769
and I didn't tell you.

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:25.528
It's just being in the hospital
that makes you feel this way.

01:24:25.686 --> 01:24:27.939
- No.
- I know that you hate it here...

01:24:28.105 --> 01:24:31.029
I know that,
but we're gonna take you home soon...

01:24:31.191 --> 01:24:33.193
and we're all gonna take care of you.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.409
- You?
- Yeah, of course me.

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:38.040
Me, Spencer, all of us.

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:41.000
Oh, God.

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:44.713
I'm so scared.

01:24:45.622 --> 01:24:48.000
Something horrible is happening...

01:24:48.166 --> 01:24:50.840
to me and the babies.

01:24:51.003 --> 01:24:53.506
I don't know what's happening.

01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:56.888
Tell me, Jillian, what is it?

01:24:57.509 --> 01:24:58.806
Spencer.

01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:10.314
He's hiding inside me.

01:25:10.981 --> 01:25:13.109
Spencer...

01:25:14.401 --> 01:25:19.077
hiding inside me.

01:25:33.295 --> 01:25:36.424
I think she's awake, Mr. Armacost.

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:05.878
Tell me something, Jill.

01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:11.333
If the doctors had any idea
what you were thinking...

01:26:12.209 --> 01:26:16.760
you know,
them awful, dark thoughts...

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:20.509
what do you think they'd do?

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:26.148
They'd lock me up.

01:26:27.808 --> 01:26:29.481
They'd lock me up.

01:26:31.603 --> 01:26:33.401
Lock you up?

01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:36.825
They'd chain you to the wall, Jillian.

01:26:39.653 --> 01:26:42.748
Yeah, put you back in that hospital.

01:26:44.991 --> 01:26:48.586
- You want that to happen?
- No.

01:26:49.663 --> 01:26:51.256
No.

01:26:51.957 --> 01:26:54.676
I know you don't want that.

01:26:55.335 --> 01:26:56.427
Well...

01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:59.757
we ain't gonna let them, are we?

01:27:01.133 --> 01:27:03.886
- No.
- No.

01:27:05.595 --> 01:27:10.601
- Because we're gonna be strong.
- We're gonna be strong...

01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:12.610
together.

01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:15.689
We're gonna be strong for our family.

01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:19.660
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:24.160
We're connected now.

01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:29.498
You feel me inside there
where it's safe, don't you?

01:27:35.542 --> 01:27:36.668
See?

01:27:40.297 --> 01:27:42.174
I live here.

01:27:43.884 --> 01:27:45.386
We're one.

01:28:14.748 --> 01:28:16.876
Why do you have
Sherman Reese's bag?

01:28:21.421 --> 01:28:23.139
What did you do to my sister?

01:28:25.884 --> 01:28:27.181
Who are you?

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:32.395
What...?
What the hell are you doing?

01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:34.605
Let go of me!

01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:44.744
Nan.

01:28:44.903 --> 01:28:46.655
Jillian! Help!

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:07.972
Nan.

01:29:12.472 --> 01:29:14.099
Nan.

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:09.446
Washington Square Park.

01:31:07.921 --> 01:31:10.094
- Go, go!
- But it is red, missus.

01:31:10.256 --> 01:31:12.509
- I don't care! Just go.
- But, missus, I cannot.

01:31:12.676 --> 01:31:14.770
Will you go? You don't understand!

01:31:14.928 --> 01:31:16.145
- Please.
- I cannot.

01:32:16.656 --> 01:32:19.455
<i>Captain Alex Streck
died last night at 8:55.</i>

01:32:22.162 --> 01:32:25.336
<i>Cause of death has been determined
to have been a massive stroke.</i>

01:32:27.167 --> 01:32:30.262
<i>What the surgeons</i> are <i>calling</i>
a <i>severe insult to the brain.</i>

01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:33.219
<i>He's not your husband anymore.
He's not.</i>

01:33:41.533 --> 01:33:43.956
Hello. Welcome back, Mrs. A.

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:55.509
Good morning, Mr. A.

01:35:06.117 --> 01:35:07.744
Nan.

01:35:09.078 --> 01:35:10.671
Jillian!

01:35:13.708 --> 01:35:15.676
Jillian!

01:35:18.630 --> 01:35:19.802
Jillian!

01:36:23.736 --> 01:36:25.488
Jesus-fucking-Christ, Jill.

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:51.480
Stay away from me.

01:36:52.348 --> 01:36:54.225
Why are you doing this to me?

01:36:55.727 --> 01:36:59.652
I said stay away from me.

01:37:10.992 --> 01:37:12.960
Who are you?

01:37:13.494 --> 01:37:15.167
Who am I?

01:37:16.539 --> 01:37:19.634
I'm the only person in the world
who ever gave a fuck about you.

01:37:21.961 --> 01:37:24.714
I'm the one
that gave you a reason to breathe.

01:37:27.133 --> 01:37:30.353
I'm every single fucking moment
ever mattered in your life.

01:37:32.388 --> 01:37:34.436
No, you're not.

01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:37.227
I don't even know you.

01:37:38.102 --> 01:37:39.319
No?

01:37:39.479 --> 01:37:42.198
Well, I'll tell you what.

01:37:42.982 --> 01:37:46.156
There was a time I remember
when I was about to go up there...

01:37:46.319 --> 01:37:48.162
and you begged me not to.

01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:51.658
You remember
how scared you were?

01:37:51.824 --> 01:37:53.622
And I told you then...

01:37:53.785 --> 01:37:56.288
that I was gonna bring you back
a piece of heaven.

01:37:57.747 --> 01:37:59.715
And you cried.

01:37:59.874 --> 01:38:01.126
You remember that?

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.804
Well, fucking A! I did it!

01:38:06.798 --> 01:38:09.051
What do you think is inside you?

01:38:12.929 --> 01:38:15.148
I gave you heaven.

01:38:16.557 --> 01:38:18.651
No, you didn't.

01:38:20.228 --> 01:38:22.071
You're not Spencer.

01:38:27.068 --> 01:38:29.491
It don't gotta be like this.
Honey, come on, now.

01:38:29.654 --> 01:38:31.281
Step out of that water.

01:38:31.864 --> 01:38:33.616
Please, baby, get out of that water.

01:38:35.868 --> 01:38:38.417
- Come on.
- Oh, my God.

01:38:41.082 --> 01:38:42.800
Please.

01:38:44.794 --> 01:38:46.671
Oh, my God.

01:38:49.424 --> 01:38:51.392
You killed my sister.

01:38:55.555 --> 01:38:57.353
You killed my husband.

01:39:02.437 --> 01:39:04.485
Yeah.

01:39:05.481 --> 01:39:07.324
I did.

01:39:10.361 --> 01:39:12.284
And then I fucked his wife.

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:17.543
I live there.

01:39:18.744 --> 01:39:19.961
No.

01:39:46.355 --> 01:39:47.732
I live there...

01:39:49.066 --> 01:39:50.283
forever.

01:39:50.443 --> 01:39:52.320
No, you don't.

01:40:09.003 --> 01:40:11.097
- I live there.
- No, you don't.

01:40:11.255 --> 01:40:13.132
Yeah. Jillian!

01:41:15.027 --> 01:41:16.745
Ready for your first day of school?

01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:17.951
Ready.

01:41:18.114 --> 01:41:19.582
Wait.

01:41:20.658 --> 01:41:21.784
Okay.

01:41:21.951 --> 01:41:24.670
There's an apple in there.
No trading. Promise?

01:41:24.829 --> 01:41:26.376
Promise.

01:41:26.539 --> 01:41:28.541
Okay. Give me a kiss.

01:41:31.043 --> 01:41:32.215
Go: go' go...

01:41:32.378 --> 01:41:34.301
Be good.

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:40.303
What do you think they'll be
when they grow up?

01:41:40.469 --> 01:41:41.561
Grow up?

01:41:41.721 --> 01:41:44.565
Give them some time, Susan.
It's their first day of school.

01:41:45.308 --> 01:41:47.026
I think...

01:41:49.895 --> 01:41:51.238
they're gonna be pilots.

01:41:51.856 --> 01:41:53.950
Just like their father.

01:41:55.067 --> 01:41:56.159
Stepfather.

01:41:59.196 --> 01:42:00.698
No.

01:42:02.366 --> 01:42:03.663
You're their father now.
