Previously
on "Criminal Minds"...

00:02.348 --> 00:04.281
Jeez, I hope you're
training for something,

00:04.886 --> 00:06.727
or do you just
do sprints for fun?

00:06.728 --> 00:09.012
I'm trying to do this
triathlon in February, so...

00:09.097 --> 00:10.330
Oh, yeah, the FBI one.

00:10.398 --> 00:11.598
What's her name?

00:11.649 --> 00:12.833
- Beth.
- I like it.

00:12.901 --> 00:14.184
Ok, Rossi, out with it.

00:14.269 --> 00:15.686
Is Hotch dating?

00:15.753 --> 00:17.855
I don't know.

00:17.922 --> 00:20.357
So, I was reading that you shouldn't
train the week before the race.

00:20.441 --> 00:22.475
So...This might be it.

00:22.527 --> 00:24.177
What are we gonna do
about that?

00:24.245 --> 00:26.196
Well, I think
we should do something.

00:26.281 --> 00:28.198
You know, race day's
almost here.

00:28.283 --> 00:30.617
You'll need a new excuse
to see her.

00:30.668 --> 00:31.952

Just keep trying. Come on.

01:22.337 --> 01:24.338
This isn't working.

01:26.591 --> 01:29.876
Maybe you're just
not in the mood.

01:29.928 --> 01:32.479
Just give me
5 more minutes.

01:32.546 --> 01:36.149
Come on. Really?

01:36.217 --> 01:39.069
Look, I've done it before.

01:39.153 --> 01:41.488
I can do it. It works.

01:41.555 --> 01:43.490
Relax. I'm not saying
you're broken.

01:43.557 --> 01:46.326
It happens.
Don't worry about it.

01:46.394 --> 01:50.197
I already paid
for the night.

01:50.248 --> 01:51.298
Yeah, I know,

01:51.366 --> 01:54.372
but, honestly,
what's gonna happen now

01:54.373 --> 01:56.618
that hasn't happened
in the last couple of hours?

01:57.071 --> 02:01.842
Come on. I just want to try
one more thing.

02:03.928 --> 02:07.297
Hmm.

02:11.853 --> 02:13.971
Ohh...

02:29.404 --> 02:30.504
Uhh!

02:33.458 --> 02:35.625
Thanks.

02:35.710 --> 02:37.494
One chai tea.

02:37.562 --> 02:39.162
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,

02:39.230 --> 02:40.464
but chai means tea.

02:40.548 --> 02:42.499
So I just ordered you a--

02:42.567 --> 02:43.633
a tea tea.

02:44.719 --> 02:46.503
So, wait a minute.

02:46.571 --> 02:48.455
There's a chance you're gonna
be out on a case this weekend?

02:48.506 --> 02:49.956
Probably a good chance.

02:50.008 --> 02:51.641
What if you don't
make it back in time?

02:51.709 --> 02:53.510
I'll just have to do
another race.

02:53.578 --> 02:55.012
But you trained
for this one.

02:55.096 --> 02:56.813
I know. I'll just
have to do the next one.

02:56.931 --> 02:58.331
Maybe I'll do yours.

02:58.399 --> 03:00.017
But you trained so hard.

03:00.084 --> 03:02.019
I know.
All for nothing.

03:02.086 --> 03:05.922
Yeah, too bad nothing
good came of it.

03:06.941 --> 03:09.943
Um, well, assuming
you do make it back,

03:09.994 --> 03:11.828
I'd really like
to be there,

03:11.913 --> 03:12.829
you know.

03:12.914 --> 03:14.581
To see me collapse
at the finish line.

03:14.648 --> 03:16.983
I want that moment. I do.

03:17.035 --> 03:19.119
I know Jack's
gonna be there, so...

03:19.170 --> 03:20.187
That's fine.

03:20.254 --> 03:23.607
I'd love for you
to meet him.

03:26.177 --> 03:27.577
Great.

03:32.266 --> 03:34.935
Oh, you're not playing around.

03:35.002 --> 03:36.178
Mm. Will's away all week,

03:36.203 --> 03:38.570
so I am pulling double duty
with Henry.

03:38.773 --> 03:41.024
Please tell me we are still on
for Saturday night,

03:41.109 --> 03:42.944
because I have had it
circled on my calendar

03:42.969 --> 03:44.588
for the last 23 1/2 days,
which apparently,

03:44.589 --> 03:46.292
from the look of you,
you did not.

03:46.297 --> 03:49.232
Garcia paid good money
for those salsa lessons.

03:49.300 --> 03:50.851
I'll get a sitter.

03:50.918 --> 03:52.685
Let's get started.

03:52.737 --> 03:56.556
Ok. Atlanta field office
has a serial on their hands.

03:56.624 --> 03:58.825
Two prostitutes stabbed and
staged in the last two weeks.

03:58.893 --> 04:01.244
Atlanta's crime rate has skyrocketed
over the past few years.

04:01.312 --> 04:03.080
Especially the proliferation
of solicited sex

04:03.164 --> 04:04.664
and drug use
in the downtown district.

04:04.715 --> 04:06.366
Maybe this guy thinks
he's cleaning up the city.

04:06.417 --> 04:07.585
It's rare for an unsub

04:07.610 --> 04:09.672
who targets prostitutes
to pose the bodies.

04:09.837 --> 04:11.477
Means of disposal usually

04:11.502 --> 04:13.801
reflects how the person
feels towards them.

04:14.425 --> 04:15.926
It looks like he didn't
think poorly of his victims.

04:16.010 --> 04:17.377
Even kept them dressed.

04:17.445 --> 04:18.928
He could be
filled with remorse.

04:18.995 --> 04:20.430
The arms are folded,
the bodies are laid to rest

04:20.515 --> 04:22.715
in a quiet park outside the city.
Maybe he knew them.

04:22.767 --> 04:23.884
It could be personal.

04:23.951 --> 04:25.602
There's a lot of rage
in these kills.

04:25.686 --> 04:26.770
Multiple stab wounds.

04:26.854 --> 04:28.638
What about
sexual violations?

04:28.706 --> 04:29.832
No. The M.E.'s report says

04:29.857 --> 04:31.988
there's no evidence of
sexual activity before death.

04:31.993 --> 04:33.393
So what's he doing
with them?

04:33.444 --> 04:35.128
That's what we need
to find out.

05:32.644 --> 05:35.346
Both of the victims had $250

05:35.397 --> 05:37.348
Why wouldn't the unsub
take that?

05:37.399 --> 05:39.850
It's a lot to pass up.
Money must not be on his mind.

05:39.902 --> 05:41.519
Dumping the bodies
certainly is.

05:41.570 --> 05:43.738
He chose two different parks
outside of Atlanta.

05:43.822 --> 05:46.524
The parks are 15 miles
apart and 40 minutes from the city.

05:46.575 --> 05:47.708
It speaks to
his comfort zone.

05:47.793 --> 05:49.193
Or he didn't want to return
to the same location

05:49.244 --> 05:50.411
and risk getting recognized.

Hey, guys, I hate to be

05:53.098 --> 05:54.582
but yet another body
has been discovered

05:54.650 --> 05:56.334
by some joggers
at yet another park.

05:56.385 --> 05:58.302
Her name's Rebecca Moore,
and get this--

05:58.370 --> 05:59.837
a missing persons report
was filed on her.

05:59.888 --> 06:01.222
Well, how long
was she missing?

06:01.290 --> 06:02.273
36 hours.

06:02.341 --> 06:03.875
Who filed it?

06:03.942 --> 06:06.077
Her friend Allyson Parker.

06:06.145 --> 06:07.311
Prentiss, you and JJ
find out from Allyson

06:07.379 --> 06:10.047
if she has any insight
on why Rebecca was targeted.

06:10.098 --> 06:11.249
Morgan and Reid,
go to the disposal site,

06:11.316 --> 06:13.067
and Dave and I will set up
at the field office.

06:17.222 --> 06:18.856
Where have you been?

06:18.907 --> 06:19.857
Out.

06:19.908 --> 06:21.359
Did you pick up the milk?

06:21.410 --> 06:22.360
No.

06:22.411 --> 06:25.246
He likes milk
with his pancakes.

06:25.314 --> 06:26.831
Sorry.

06:26.898 --> 06:32.170
Sorry. It's not gonna make it
magically appear, now, is it?

06:33.288 --> 06:37.091
I made your favorites.

06:37.176 --> 06:39.260
And I know you like
a little oil in the pan

06:39.344 --> 06:40.795
so the edges are crispy.

06:44.299 --> 06:46.000
I considered making you
scrambled eggs,

06:46.068 --> 06:48.352
but with that whole recall
and everything,

06:48.420 --> 06:50.338
I figured pancakes
are a safer bet.

06:50.405 --> 06:52.056
How are they?

07:03.652 --> 07:04.986
You need to eat.

07:05.070 --> 07:08.005
Erika will be here
any minute.

07:08.073 --> 07:10.107
Oh, I'd like to have her
for dinner.

07:10.158 --> 07:11.726
How's tomorrow?

07:18.050 --> 07:19.483
Sweetheart. Sweetheart!

07:19.551 --> 07:21.819
You haven't taken
your vitamins.

07:23.555 --> 07:25.823
Those aren't vitamins.

07:25.891 --> 07:27.542
Donald.

07:39.988 --> 07:41.489
Hi. I'm Agent Brooks.

07:41.573 --> 07:43.841
Thanks for getting here
so fast.

07:43.909 --> 07:45.326
This guy's not taking
a break.

07:45.410 --> 07:46.994
Now 3 victims in two weeks?

07:47.079 --> 07:49.313
I thought there was supposed
to be a cooling-off period.

07:49.364 --> 07:50.831
His recovery time
is decreasing.

07:50.916 --> 07:51.832
What's that about?

07:51.917 --> 07:53.200
It's hard to say.

07:53.285 --> 07:55.419
Well, I hope we catch him
before there's another.

07:55.487 --> 07:57.321
Is your M.E. close?
I can get you a ride.

07:57.372 --> 08:00.124
We're picking up
Rebecca Moore's body now.

08:10.269 --> 08:12.603
Why didn't you say
anything at breakfast?

08:12.671 --> 08:14.138
He won't listen to me.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.606
So I have to be
the bad guy

08:15.674 --> 08:17.391
while you just watch, or are you
gonna sit there

08:17.476 --> 08:20.428
like a lump on a log with that
stupid look on your face?

08:20.495 --> 08:22.863
Linda, I don't want
to do this right now.

08:22.931 --> 08:24.482
Oh, you think I do?
When I am trying

08:24.533 --> 08:26.317
to give Jeffrey his pills,
I need you to back me up.

08:26.368 --> 08:28.202
Is that understood?

08:28.287 --> 08:30.688
Look at me.

08:33.191 --> 08:34.912
We both know
what happens when he

08:34.937 --> 08:36.136
goes off his medication.

08:46.388 --> 08:51.008
So he parks in the road
and then carries the body, what?

08:51.059 --> 08:53.678
52.6 yards.

08:53.729 --> 08:56.430
Uphill. So he's gotta
be in great shape.

08:56.498 --> 08:58.149
You know, more often than not,
prostitutes are murdered and dumped

08:58.216 --> 08:59.734
in the same area
that they work.

08:59.818 --> 09:02.186
So then why take the time to drive
the extra 40 miles outside the city?

09:02.237 --> 09:04.438
Maybe he's already up here.
He picks them up downtown,

09:04.523 --> 09:05.940
takes them to
a secondary location,

09:06.024 --> 09:09.026
kills them, and gets rid
of the body as fast as possible.

09:09.077 --> 09:10.945
Which means he lives nearby,
in the suburbs.

09:11.013 --> 09:13.197
With 76,728 other people.

09:16.535 --> 09:18.402
Your mom's so sweet.

09:18.453 --> 09:20.404
She invited me
to dinner tomorrow.

09:20.455 --> 09:23.124
Wanted to know
if I was a vegetarian.

09:23.208 --> 09:24.575
That's great.

09:24.626 --> 09:25.960
Now just give me
one more set.

09:26.044 --> 09:28.129
How about I give you
two more?

09:28.213 --> 09:29.413
Oh, really?

09:29.464 --> 09:31.132
Well, you want me to stop?

09:31.216 --> 09:32.883
No, no, no.
Keep going.

09:32.934 --> 09:35.252
Now, this is one that
I want you to keep up

09:35.303 --> 09:36.804
for when your friends
come over.

09:36.888 --> 09:39.607
Just remember that the bigger the
challenge, the better the resistance.

09:39.691 --> 09:41.892
Nobody really comes by
anymore.

09:41.943 --> 09:43.611
Really?

09:43.695 --> 09:45.946
Yeah, I mean,
they did at first,

09:46.031 --> 09:47.782
but once they
went away to school,

09:47.866 --> 09:50.518
nobody looked back.

09:50.585 --> 09:54.488
You know, sometimes friends,
they don't know how to handle it.

09:54.573 --> 09:56.857
They're afraid that they're
gonna say the wrong thing.

09:56.925 --> 09:58.325
Yeah.

09:58.410 --> 10:00.661
Don't worry, though. I'm gonna
keep you warmed up

10:00.746 --> 10:02.446
for when they
come around again.

10:02.497 --> 10:05.115
All right, stop this.
I want you to take a break.

10:09.221 --> 10:10.788
Now, let's change things up.

10:10.889 --> 10:13.307
Let's isolate your chest
and then 5 more pounds.

10:13.392 --> 10:15.559
This will increase
your upper body strength,

10:15.627 --> 10:17.511
which is gonna make it
easier for you

10:17.596 --> 10:19.180
when you're getting
in and out of your chair.

10:22.934 --> 10:24.890
You're gonna need a real
challenge now that

10:24.915 --> 10:26.115
you're getting stronger.

10:26.438 --> 10:27.405
What do you mean?

10:27.472 --> 10:29.306
Come on,
you haven't noticed?

10:29.357 --> 10:31.675
Maybe, a little.

10:31.743 --> 10:33.494
Are you kidding?
These past couple weeks

10:33.578 --> 10:34.862
you've been like Superman.

10:34.946 --> 10:36.814
Spill it--
what's your secret?

10:36.865 --> 10:39.400
I don't--
I don't know.

10:39.468 --> 10:42.203
No? Ok, fine.
You don't have to tell me.

10:42.287 --> 10:45.122
Just keep it up. Whatever it is,
you're doing great.

10:45.190 --> 10:47.925
Ok, get back in there.

10:50.045 --> 10:51.995
We're very sorry
for your loss.

10:52.047 --> 10:54.715
How long were you
and Rebecca friends?

10:54.800 --> 10:57.000
3 years.

10:57.052 --> 10:58.502
You two had
each other's backs.

10:58.553 --> 11:00.003
That's why
you filed the report?

11:00.055 --> 11:01.639
It was almost
two days.

11:01.690 --> 11:05.008
I thought she was
at the police station.

11:05.060 --> 11:08.395
Getting locked up is better than
disappearing with one of them.

11:08.463 --> 11:10.848
So what made you think
something was wrong?

11:10.899 --> 11:12.182
She always came back.

11:12.234 --> 11:15.319
Bad as it was,
this place was home, you know?

11:15.370 --> 11:18.205
Did she have any regular
customers?

11:18.290 --> 11:20.541
We all do.

11:20.625 --> 11:24.378
Rebecca had over $250
on her.

11:24.463 --> 11:25.863
She did?

11:25.914 --> 11:28.866
What would that kind
of money get a customer?

11:28.917 --> 11:30.367
A lot.

11:30.418 --> 11:33.036
Like all night or...

11:33.088 --> 11:36.340
Nowadays, yeah.

11:41.980 --> 11:44.047
What is it?

11:44.099 --> 11:46.550
We need to find another girl.

11:46.601 --> 11:47.718
We just did.

11:47.769 --> 11:49.052
So do it again.

11:49.104 --> 11:50.721
I can't go back there.

11:50.772 --> 11:51.889
Why not?

11:51.940 --> 11:53.290
It's too soon.

11:53.358 --> 11:54.725
Find another way.

11:54.776 --> 11:56.977
Is he really
getting better?

11:57.045 --> 11:58.996
I just heard Erika say
that she's noticed

11:59.063 --> 12:01.282
a big improvement
in the last couple of weeks.

12:02.617 --> 12:04.952
Don't you want him
to be happy?

12:07.572 --> 12:08.956
I'll take care of it.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.841
Good.

12:13.011 --> 12:14.929
Any sexual assault?

12:15.013 --> 12:17.932
Third victim,
still no signs of inflammation

12:18.016 --> 12:20.017
or forcible penetration.

12:20.084 --> 12:22.223
His inability to perform
sexually could be

12:22.248 --> 12:23.448
what triggers his rage.

12:23.738 --> 12:25.189
Well,
there's plenty of that.

12:25.256 --> 12:27.358
Multiple stab wounds
to the lungs.

12:27.425 --> 12:28.859
She drowned
in her own blood.

12:28.927 --> 12:31.645
It takes a lot of force
to inflict these types of wounds.

12:31.730 --> 12:32.930
Oh, he's strong,
no doubt.

12:32.998 --> 12:35.299
The knife cut right through bone
in some instances.

12:35.367 --> 12:37.484
And what's this
on her inner thigh?

12:37.569 --> 12:39.036
That's a tramline bruise.

12:39.103 --> 12:42.573
It's cause by something with a
longitudinal cylindrical surface.

12:42.624 --> 12:44.625
Like a rod?

12:44.709 --> 12:47.127
Yes. And I found the same type
of bruising on the others.

12:47.212 --> 12:49.663
Maybe some kind of restraint?

12:49.748 --> 12:51.615
It's possible.

12:52.801 --> 12:54.635
We need to take you back

12:54.719 --> 12:56.453
to the last time
you saw Rebecca.

12:56.521 --> 12:57.788
Where were you standing?

12:57.839 --> 13:00.140
About here.

13:00.225 --> 13:01.475
Facing which way?

13:01.560 --> 13:02.643
Street.

13:02.727 --> 13:04.461
A truck pulled up.

13:04.512 --> 13:06.230
He was one of
my regulars.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.818
I was talking to him
through the window

13:10.902 --> 13:13.153
when Rebecca pulled up
in a silver Beemer.

13:13.238 --> 13:14.822
Did you
recognize the car?

13:14.906 --> 13:17.157
No. It must have been
a new customer.

13:17.242 --> 13:18.659
What did she do after that?

13:18.743 --> 13:22.496
She looked back at me and
started walking down the walk.

13:22.581 --> 13:25.366
That's the last time
I saw her.

13:25.450 --> 13:26.817
Wait a second.

13:26.918 --> 13:28.919
There was an older gray van.

13:32.257 --> 13:34.174
I've seen it around here
before.

13:34.259 --> 13:36.510
It was parked there
a long time.

13:36.595 --> 13:37.912
A van? Where?

13:37.979 --> 13:40.247
It parks right there.

13:40.315 --> 13:42.099
Could you make out
a license plate?

13:42.166 --> 13:43.250
No, it was dark.

13:43.318 --> 13:44.718
How long
was it there?

13:44.803 --> 13:46.503
A few hours, probably.

13:46.571 --> 13:48.222
Why?

13:48.306 --> 13:50.808
It's a loading zone.
Permit parking only.

13:52.944 --> 13:54.612
Go long, Bobby! Hut!

14:00.168 --> 14:02.536
Excuse me.

14:02.621 --> 14:06.356
Hi. I'm not sure
I'm at the right address.

14:06.408 --> 14:07.558
Mr. Collins?

14:07.626 --> 14:08.993
Yes. Hi.

14:09.044 --> 14:11.061
I'm sorry,
can I help you?

14:11.129 --> 14:13.047
My name is Julie.
I'm here to see Jeffrey.

14:13.131 --> 14:15.382
Oh. Yes.

14:15.467 --> 14:17.251
Please, come in.

14:28.263 --> 14:30.514
Were you going to use
your insurance?

14:30.565 --> 14:32.683
I'd like to pay
out of pocket.

14:32.734 --> 14:35.019
Most of my clients
haven't filed, either.

14:35.070 --> 14:36.937
It's still considered
progressive treatment, I guess.

14:37.022 --> 14:38.639
That's a lovely necklace.

14:38.707 --> 14:41.224
Oh, thank you.

14:41.276 --> 14:43.944
Jeffrey's room is down
at the end of the hall.

14:44.029 --> 14:45.446
Great. Thanks.

14:51.619 --> 14:53.137
Reid, anything?

14:53.204 --> 14:54.955
Now that we have 3 victims,
there's a pattern.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.991
It looks like his area of
control is near Ridgecrest.

14:57.058 --> 14:58.909
That's a bedroom community.
Mostly white collar.

14:58.960 --> 15:02.245
It give him easy access to his
hunting grounds and disposal sites.

15:02.297 --> 15:04.598
Vehicle blends into
both places.

15:04.683 --> 15:06.667
Allyson remembered seeing
a van parked on the street

15:06.735 --> 15:08.352
the night that Rebecca
disappeared.

15:08.419 --> 15:09.753
And she'd seen it before.
But get this--

15:09.804 --> 15:11.939
it was parked in a loading
zone for hours.

15:12.023 --> 15:13.991
Well, let me check
any recent tickets.

15:14.059 --> 15:15.476
Our analyst already
did that. Nothing.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.478
It's not a residential
area, so a vendor maybe.

15:17.562 --> 15:18.645
Garcia's
pulling permits now.

15:18.730 --> 15:20.481
He's done this
3 times before.

15:20.565 --> 15:22.316
Each victim is left
with 250.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.152
That's a $750 investment
he didn't have to make.

15:25.236 --> 15:27.121
He has every chance
to take that money back,

15:27.205 --> 15:28.672
but he buries it
with them instead.

15:28.740 --> 15:31.358
It could be an obsession
or a manifestation of his guilt.

15:31.426 --> 15:32.993
Everything that happened
postmortem--

15:33.078 --> 15:35.829
keeping them dressed, crossing
their arms, laying them to rest--

15:35.914 --> 15:37.164
it's all very nurturing.

15:37.248 --> 15:39.216
But the kills
are the exact opposite,

15:39.283 --> 15:40.834
incredibly violent
and angry.

15:40.919 --> 15:42.169
Multiple personalities?

15:42.253 --> 15:43.287
Or multiple unsubs.

15:43.354 --> 15:44.838
The violent one
asserts his dominance

15:44.923 --> 15:46.924
and the submissive one
is left to clean up the mess.

16:11.166 --> 16:13.700
Help me.

16:34.505 --> 16:35.856
Help me.

16:35.940 --> 16:38.508
Help me.

16:38.560 --> 16:42.279
Help me. Help me.

16:49.869 --> 16:52.476
Her name's Julie Harmon.
Lives in a loft downtown.

16:52.478 --> 16:55.564
Envelope of cash was in her bag,
wrapped in plastic.

16:55.632 --> 16:58.400
That's new. It's like she's
prepped for a burial.

16:58.467 --> 17:00.819
This woman doesn't fit
his victimology.

17:00.904 --> 17:01.970
Look at her nails.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.155
The way she's dressed.

17:03.239 --> 17:04.806
Her shoes haven't hit
the pavement.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.325
Maybe she's a high-class
call girl.

17:06.392 --> 17:08.577
Who fought back
and got punished for it.

17:08.644 --> 17:11.396
Blunt-force trauma,
same bruising on the thighs.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.415
This is the most violent
and shortest time between kills.

17:14.483 --> 17:16.568
It feels like he's trying
to break some kind of record.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.587
This team has
a complicated dynamic.

17:18.655 --> 17:20.255
Ultimately they trust
one another,

17:20.323 --> 17:22.523
but they're still
codependent, enabling.

17:22.592 --> 17:24.009
It sounds like any
dysfunctional relationship.

17:24.093 --> 17:25.676
How do we narrow that down?

17:25.762 --> 17:27.628
Through her. The more
we can learn about Julie,

17:27.696 --> 17:30.365
the better we can understand
why they're doing this.

17:30.433 --> 17:33.919
Did you see
what he did to her?

17:33.987 --> 17:36.221
It wasn't any worse
than the others.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.522
It was as bad
as the coed.

17:37.607 --> 17:40.442
Ohh! Will you let that go!

17:40.509 --> 17:41.944
We've given him
everything he wants.

17:42.011 --> 17:43.779
I can't keep doing this.

17:43.846 --> 17:46.231
What do you want to do,
stop? She said he's getting stronger.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.699
What if he can walk again?

17:47.784 --> 17:49.351
You know what
the chances are.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.019
Well, he's always been
exceptional.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.321
I'm not giving up on him.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.241
Scrub!

17:56.326 --> 17:58.677
Use your scrub brush.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.217
We're looking for a pair
of white males

18:05.301 --> 18:07.052
in their late 20s
to early 30s,

18:07.136 --> 18:09.721
who've developed a pattern of
overkill followed by remorse.

18:09.806 --> 18:12.391
This usually points to
a dominant-submissive partnership.

18:12.475 --> 18:15.427
The submissive follows
the rules, knows the dominant's type,

18:15.511 --> 18:18.096
obtains the victims
and disposes of the body

18:18.181 --> 18:20.432
once the dominant has
completed his killing ritual.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.549
What is the ritual?

18:21.601 --> 18:24.069
It most likely involves
some form of bondage.

18:24.153 --> 18:26.905
All of the victims have identical
bruises on their thighs,

18:27.023 --> 18:30.909
but we're not sure if that's
done during capture or kill.

18:30.994 --> 18:32.911
There's no sexual assault,
which tells us the dominant

18:32.996 --> 18:34.913
is likely impotent
or is experimenting

18:34.998 --> 18:36.915
with other forms
of sexual release.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.784
We often refer to this
as a thrill kill.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.453
The dominant is inducing
pain and creating terror

18:41.537 --> 18:43.088
without a sexual element.

18:43.172 --> 18:45.407
This provides him
stimulation and excitement.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.758
Like an adrenaline rush.

18:46.843 --> 18:49.127
Exactly. The thrill of the murder
is only a temporary fix.

18:49.195 --> 18:52.381
Like any narcotic, the violence
satisfies his senses for a time,

18:52.432 --> 18:53.765
but then it fades.

18:53.850 --> 18:57.352
This is likely why his cooling-off.
period is nonexistent.

18:57.420 --> 18:58.687
Despite a public
investigation

18:58.754 --> 19:00.355
the unsubs have continued
killing.

19:00.423 --> 19:03.342
The risk of getting caught
does not trump their need to kill.

19:05.594 --> 19:08.630
We're moving on to the next
round of "Go the Limit."

19:08.698 --> 19:10.832
All right, come on.

19:10.900 --> 19:14.536
I just love this game.

19:14.603 --> 19:17.873
All right. Are you ready
to play our bonus round?

19:17.940 --> 19:19.941
Ready as I can be.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.276
Ok. Now, Mary Ellen...

19:21.641 --> 19:22.924
I want another one.

19:22.976 --> 19:25.728
We have to talk
about this, son.

19:25.779 --> 19:28.147
What is there
to talk about?

19:28.198 --> 19:31.950
Well, uh,
how are you feeling?

19:32.035 --> 19:34.036
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

19:34.103 --> 19:35.871
Your father's just
trying to ask you.

19:35.938 --> 19:37.573
We made a deal
when you moved back in

19:37.624 --> 19:40.376
that as long as you're under our roof,
you will take your meds.

19:40.443 --> 19:41.910
Well, they mess me up!

19:41.961 --> 19:44.913
Look, if this is your way
of trying to kick me out,

19:44.964 --> 19:46.448
just come out and say it.

19:46.499 --> 19:48.500
We're not trying
to kick you out.

19:48.585 --> 19:50.436
We'll ask the doctor
about changing your prescription,

19:50.503 --> 19:52.855
but for now you have to take your meds.
It's been a couple of weeks.

19:52.922 --> 19:54.217
How dare you!

19:54.242 --> 19:57.142
Just because she's been
popping pills my entire life

19:57.143 --> 19:58.360
doesn't mean I have to!

19:58.428 --> 20:00.345
That is enough!

20:00.430 --> 20:04.883
You're drunk,
aren't you, Dad?

20:04.951 --> 20:06.935
That's ok.
I don't blame you,

20:07.003 --> 20:09.188
for being married to her.

20:09.272 --> 20:11.206
I said that is enough!

20:11.274 --> 20:13.709
Or what? What are you gonna do
that she hasn't already ruined?

20:13.777 --> 20:16.245
We're doing
the best we can.

20:16.312 --> 20:18.113
You're not doing enough.

20:18.164 --> 20:20.616
You really want to help me?

20:20.667 --> 20:23.135
Then you'll put me
out of my misery.

20:32.312 --> 20:34.373
Ok, Sugar Lump. I got
all the information

20:34.398 --> 20:35.431
on the latest victim,

20:35.432 --> 20:37.266
and it turns out
you were half right.

20:37.333 --> 20:39.668
Julie Harmon was
a sexual surrogate.

20:39.769 --> 20:42.771
They help people
get their get-it-on on.

20:42.839 --> 20:45.057
It's like having a hall pass
with your therapist.

20:45.141 --> 20:46.809
Does she have a list
of patients?

20:46.860 --> 20:49.478
Oh, I'm sure she does, but I can't
find anything electronically.

20:49.529 --> 20:51.597
She probably had a little black book,
you know, Luddite like.

20:51.664 --> 20:54.867
All right. Thank you, mama.

20:54.951 --> 20:57.703
Julie Harmon
was a sexual surrogate.

20:57.787 --> 21:00.205
Whoa! Sounds like somebody
felt a little progressive prescription

21:00.290 --> 21:01.707
might fix everything.

21:01.791 --> 21:03.041
Well, they were wrong.

21:03.126 --> 21:04.910
That's not just going
from high- to low-risk victims.

21:04.994 --> 21:06.695
A sexual surrogate's
a very specific type.

21:06.746 --> 21:08.413
It's like they were
trying to fix something.

21:08.498 --> 21:09.882
Why else would you
call a therapist?

21:09.949 --> 21:12.551
They do treat patients
will all types of disabilities,

21:12.635 --> 21:15.254
whether it's developmental,
physical, or emotional.

21:15.338 --> 21:17.089
Well, my guess is
this guy had all 3.

21:17.173 --> 21:18.198
Let's look at the physical.

21:18.223 --> 21:19.842
He's got the upper-body
strength to kill.

21:19.843 --> 21:23.278
But the victims' bruises tells
us that he was using restraints.

21:23.346 --> 21:24.763
Only they're not around
the hands and feet,

21:24.848 --> 21:26.765
where you'd typically
restrain a victim.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.801
They're tramline bruises
around the thighs.

21:28.868 --> 21:31.436
It's as if the victims
are straddling a chair.

21:31.504 --> 21:32.771
Physical infirmity,
strong arms.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.106
What if the unsub's
in a wheelchair?

21:34.190 --> 21:36.275
That would explain
the van parked in the loading zone.

21:36.359 --> 21:38.577
Handicap permits grant access
all over the city.

21:38.661 --> 21:39.995
I'll call Garcia.

21:40.062 --> 21:41.997
We should talk to social workers,
physical therapists,

21:42.064 --> 21:44.266
anyone who deals directly
with the disabled.

21:44.334 --> 21:45.784
Given the anger
and inability to perform,

21:45.869 --> 21:47.286
those injuries
are not recent.

21:47.370 --> 21:49.121
His explosive outbursts
could be built-up frustration,

21:49.205 --> 21:50.131
which usually manifests

21:50.156 --> 21:51.723
when things are out of one's
control, like an accident.

21:51.724 --> 21:53.074
Ok, so let's go with that.

21:53.126 --> 21:55.410
I mean, whoever's helping
him has a definite loyalty.

21:55.461 --> 21:56.862
Responsibility, even.

21:56.930 --> 21:58.079
The caregiver could have
caused the impairment.

21:58.131 --> 22:00.749
He's the one who has
shown remorse and guilt.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.467
He might have
a sense of morality.

22:02.552 --> 22:05.086
If that's the case, the best way
to break up a partnership

22:05.138 --> 22:06.755
is to drive a wedge
between them.

22:06.806 --> 22:09.458
And the key to doing that is to
tell the caregiver he's forgiven.

22:09.526 --> 22:11.009
Give him the strength
to leave.

22:11.077 --> 22:14.062
I'll tell Agent Brooks
to organize a press conference.

23:11.588 --> 23:13.755
And we would like to appeal
to this individual,

23:13.823 --> 23:17.409
whom we believe functions as
a caretaker, to come forward

23:17.477 --> 23:19.595
and allow us to help.

23:19.662 --> 23:21.997
You can stop this
from happening to others

23:22.048 --> 23:26.518
by doing the right thing
and contacting the Atlanta P.D.

23:26.603 --> 23:30.222
We understand that you feel
a sense of loyalty towards your partner

23:30.306 --> 23:32.774
and the need to comply
with their demands,

23:32.842 --> 23:36.528
but if you contact us,
we will do everything in our power

23:36.613 --> 23:38.196
to help you both.

23:38.281 --> 23:40.782
That was FBI Agent Jareau...

24:06.509 --> 24:08.093
It's time.

24:08.161 --> 24:10.912
I know.

24:33.569 --> 24:35.640
How effective are those
press conferences?

24:35.641 --> 24:36.557
Incredibly.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.226
Then why haven't we
heard from him?

24:38.310 --> 24:40.561
A bond like this
takes years to develop.

24:40.646 --> 24:43.014
We're not going to break it
in a few hours.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.535
I'm so glad
you could make it.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.737
I never turn down
a home-cooked meal.

25:06.789 --> 25:08.072
These are for you.

25:08.123 --> 25:10.541
Oh, thank you.
They're beautiful.

25:12.845 --> 25:16.413
Everyone's waiting for you.

25:16.465 --> 25:18.766
Everything about Julie Harmon's
murder was different.

25:18.851 --> 25:22.220
It was the most violent
and remorseful.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.472
It's like the partners
were each at their extremes.

25:24.556 --> 25:27.028
All of the bodies were disposed
of in a nurturing way, but you're

25:27.029 --> 25:29.980
right. Julie was wrapped
in plastic. It's neat.

25:30.479 --> 25:31.979
It's almost too neat.

25:32.064 --> 25:34.098
Maybe the caretaker
is a woman.

25:34.149 --> 25:37.268
By nature, women prefer
cleaner disposal methods.

25:37.319 --> 25:39.987
I don't know. I mean, that terrain
was something serious.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.573
I mean, no offense, ladies,
but Reid and I hiked up that Ridge

25:42.624 --> 25:44.242
and there's no way a woman,
physically fit or not,

25:44.293 --> 25:45.793
could carry dead weight
all that way.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.079
And we profiled that the partner's
in a wheelchair,

25:48.130 --> 25:50.832
so that would make it impossible
for him to help with disposal.

25:50.916 --> 25:54.368
So there's a third person
involved. That rarely works.

25:54.436 --> 25:55.803
It's always two against one.

25:55.871 --> 25:57.338
They'd have to trust
one another completely.

25:57.422 --> 25:59.623
So what kind of relationship
involves that dynamic?

25:59.675 --> 26:01.458
They'd have to be
incredibly good friends.

26:01.510 --> 26:02.960
Or blackmailing
one another.

26:03.011 --> 26:04.178
Siblings.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.914
What if it's parents
protecting a child?

26:08.100 --> 26:10.818
They raise them.
They root for them.

26:10.886 --> 26:12.820
They would share
the same genes.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.389
Apples don't fall
far from the tree.

26:15.457 --> 26:16.747
A parent would hold
themselves accountable.

26:16.772 --> 26:17.972
That explains the guilt.

26:18.360 --> 26:20.811
But what kind of sick
family pulls this off?

26:20.863 --> 26:23.915
One that's probably
done it before.

26:47.856 --> 26:50.474
Oh, my God.

26:50.525 --> 26:52.176
I know. It worked.

26:52.227 --> 26:54.478
Can you believe it,
Mrs. Collins?

27:13.465 --> 27:15.216
We think they have
an only child.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.534
It's unlikely a sibling would
participate in something this extreme.

27:17.586 --> 27:19.370
If they felt responsible
for his accident,

27:19.421 --> 27:20.704
they might have
rationalized

27:20.756 --> 27:22.039
doing anything
to make him happy.

27:22.090 --> 27:23.707
Well, we doubt murder
is something they planned on.

27:23.759 --> 27:25.542
It's more like a lethal
side effect of their son's condition.

27:25.594 --> 27:28.062
If there was orbital cortex
damage from the accident,

27:28.146 --> 27:30.214
it would help explain why
killing is his release.

27:30.265 --> 27:31.715
If the mother has
psychopathic tendencies,

27:31.767 --> 27:33.601
she could have passed it down
through the X chromosome.

27:33.685 --> 27:36.253
Garcia's looking up accidents now
that have the parents at fault.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.589
That list has to be long.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.692
It is. So she's also looking for
unsolved cases in the state.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.578
There's a good chance this isn't
the first time the son's acted out.

27:44.646 --> 27:46.580
Mmm. The chicken's
nice and tender.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.082
Mm-hmm.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.067
I cooked it all the way
through, because,

27:50.118 --> 27:51.836
you know, salmonella
is the silent killer

27:51.903 --> 27:53.737
that nobody wants
to talk about.

27:59.077 --> 28:03.414
So, Erika, do you have
a big family?

28:03.465 --> 28:05.182
Um, I've got
two older brothers.

28:05.250 --> 28:06.417
Oh.

28:06.468 --> 28:08.185
You're the baby.

28:08.253 --> 28:09.687
And the only girl.

28:09.754 --> 28:10.855
Yep.

28:10.922 --> 28:12.473
So was it loud in your house,
all those boys

28:12.557 --> 28:13.858
clomping around?

28:13.925 --> 28:16.644
I never knew any different.

28:16.728 --> 28:18.929
When Jeffrey would come home
after a game with his friends,

28:18.981 --> 28:21.983
I swear they had
bricks in their shoes.

28:22.067 --> 28:25.536
They would shake
the whole house. Ha ha.

28:30.575 --> 28:34.045
And then Donald wanted
to go for a girl.

28:34.112 --> 28:35.663
Remember?

28:38.333 --> 28:40.083
'Cause he said,

28:40.108 --> 28:43.962
"Mama's boy. Mama's boy
and daddy's girl."

28:44.840 --> 28:47.508
But I said no, because I
knew that I could never love

28:47.576 --> 28:50.177
another child
as much as I love Jeffrey.

28:51.563 --> 28:55.566
I just didn't have room
in my heart for anyone else.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.576
Oh, that's--that's sweet.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.006
Have you got it?

29:36.058 --> 29:37.674
Yeah.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.213
Uh, Garcia, you're on speaker.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.782
Ok, the only thing I can find
that's remotely similar to this

30:01.850 --> 30:03.717
is from 5 years ago.

30:03.785 --> 30:07.138
A coed at Georgia State
was stabbed and left in a park.

30:07.205 --> 30:08.722
Did she have bruises
on her inner thigh?

30:08.807 --> 30:11.092
Uh, M.E. says...

30:11.176 --> 30:12.560
Yes, she did.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.711
All right, Garcia, check
student enrollment for that year

30:14.763 --> 30:16.614
for students with campus
handicap permits.

30:16.681 --> 30:19.400
I got a bushelful of matches.
Let's narrow this down.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.218
Look for in-state residents.

30:21.269 --> 30:24.138
If the unsub was injured, there's a
good chance he stayed close to home.

30:24.206 --> 30:25.823
They're all locals.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.408
The parents would have
covered it up

30:27.492 --> 30:29.243
and they would have
pulled their son out of school

30:29.327 --> 30:30.427
after the murder.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.329
Here we go. Jeffrey Collins.

30:32.397 --> 30:34.231
He dropped out of school
weeks after the murder

30:34.282 --> 30:35.533
and has since lived
with his parents.

30:35.584 --> 30:36.733
What's his story?

30:36.785 --> 30:38.285
Sending it to you right now.
He's the only child

30:38.353 --> 30:39.954
of Linda and Donald Collins.

30:40.038 --> 30:42.289
He was a local athlete
who became paralyzed

30:42.357 --> 30:44.208
when he was in a car accident
when he was 15.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.760
It says here the mother was driving,
but the injuries weren't consistent

30:46.845 --> 30:47.928
with being behind the wheel.

30:48.013 --> 30:48.929
But the father's were. Look.

30:48.997 --> 30:50.214
Broken ribs, ruptured spleen,

30:50.265 --> 30:51.549
minor concussion.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.217
He's obviously the one
who hit the steering wheel.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.885
Let me guess.
The father was drunk.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.303
Yeah. Twice the legal limit.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.556
Sounds like they switched places
and she covered for him.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.891
But helping your husband
avoid a DUI if far different

31:00.942 --> 31:02.977
than helping your son
dispose of bodies.

31:03.061 --> 31:04.761
Not necessarily.
The mother fixes things.

31:04.813 --> 31:06.230
She could have
manipulated the husband

31:06.281 --> 31:08.432
into making up
for his failure.

31:08.500 --> 31:09.650
Garcia, you got an address?

31:09.734 --> 31:11.402
Sending it to you now.

31:14.005 --> 31:15.539
That was good.

31:17.242 --> 31:20.077
Did you like it?

31:20.128 --> 31:23.447
Yeah, I did.

31:25.433 --> 31:27.351
Do you want to watch
something else?

31:31.473 --> 31:34.441
Actually, I'm feeling
kind of tired.

31:35.977 --> 31:37.261
Well, you've been squinting
all night.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.529
Do you have
one of your headaches?

31:38.597 --> 31:41.031
Yeah.

31:41.099 --> 31:42.900
Did you take your meds today?

31:44.802 --> 31:47.872
You can't stop
taking those, you know.

31:48.973 --> 31:51.692
Are they still
in your room?

31:51.760 --> 31:53.861
Yes, but my dad
can get them.

31:53.945 --> 31:55.646
That's ok.
I can get them.

32:04.623 --> 32:05.956
Oh--

32:17.185 --> 32:18.385
what is this?

32:18.470 --> 32:20.804
Why is there blood
under the bed?

32:20.855 --> 32:23.224
You really shouldn't
be in here.

32:23.291 --> 32:26.527
There's blood.
Why is there blood?

32:27.979 --> 32:29.730
I'm his mother.

32:29.814 --> 32:32.049
I would have
gotten the pills.

33:51.527 --> 33:52.708
We were on our way
to the Collins home

33:52.733 --> 33:53.933
when we received the call.

33:55.698 --> 33:58.833
Donald Collins was behind the wheel.
Died on impact.

33:58.885 --> 34:01.002
We found this
in his coat pocket.

34:01.053 --> 34:03.421
He confessed
to all 4 murders.

34:03.506 --> 34:06.040
Even in death
he's still covering for his son.

34:06.092 --> 34:07.926
No one else in the car?

34:07.994 --> 34:09.377
No.

34:09.428 --> 34:12.213
No skid marks. He probably hit the pole
going about 65 mph.

34:12.264 --> 34:14.683
He committed suicide.

34:14.750 --> 34:16.318
It looks like he was
trying to replicate the accident

34:16.385 --> 34:17.719
that made Jeff
a paraplegic.

34:17.770 --> 34:19.938
This was his
ultimate penance.

34:20.022 --> 34:21.156
Is this their endgame?

34:21.223 --> 34:22.524
If he was trying
to replicate the accident,

34:22.574 --> 34:24.643
Jeff and Linda would have
both been in the car.

34:24.710 --> 34:27.228
So where are they?

34:27.280 --> 34:29.331
When someone invites you over,

34:29.398 --> 34:31.983
you come in, you eat,
you smile,

34:32.051 --> 34:33.335
but then you leave.

34:33.402 --> 34:35.420
The flowers were
a really nice touch.

34:35.504 --> 34:37.672
But obviously the rest
of your manners are lacking.

34:37.739 --> 34:38.924
What the hell
are you doing?

34:39.007 --> 34:40.574
I gotta get her
out of here.

34:40.626 --> 34:42.344
She has nothing
to do with this.

34:54.204 --> 34:55.155
Somebody help me.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.092
She found out, and I'm not about
to let her ruin everything.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.753
I'm sorry. I know you really

34:59.778 --> 35:01.297
liked her, but I'll find you
someone else, ok?

35:01.298 --> 35:04.384
- FBI!
- Aah! Help me!

35:04.435 --> 35:06.136
Put the gun down.

35:06.220 --> 35:08.138
Listen, Mrs. Collins, we need you
to put down your weapon.

35:08.222 --> 35:09.439
Get the hell
out of my house!

35:09.507 --> 35:11.641
Get my dad.
He'll tell you she's crazy.

35:11.725 --> 35:13.610
Your father was killed
in a car accident.

35:13.694 --> 35:15.061
What?

35:15.112 --> 35:16.396
Did he tell you
what he did?

35:16.447 --> 35:18.731
He killed all those girls,
that sick son of a bitch.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.300
Linda, this is over.
Jeff is coming with us.

35:20.367 --> 35:21.434
He's not going anywhere.

35:21.485 --> 35:22.768
Your dad
took his own life

35:22.820 --> 35:24.954
because he couldn't stand
to be a part of this anymore.

35:25.039 --> 35:26.739
- He couldn't stand the guilt.
- He's a drunk.

35:26.791 --> 35:27.791
Look what he did
to my son!

35:27.875 --> 35:29.108
Look what he did
to my boy!

35:29.160 --> 35:31.777
You did this.
She's lying.

35:31.829 --> 35:34.113
You need to let him
take responsibility.

35:34.165 --> 35:36.149
We know that Jeff
hurt those girls.

35:36.217 --> 35:40.286
You people. You think
you're gonna come in here

35:40.337 --> 35:42.121
and you're just gonna
take my son

35:42.173 --> 35:44.591
and you're gonna lock him up
like some animal!

35:44.642 --> 35:46.910
Linda, put it down.

35:50.797 --> 35:52.649
Mom.

35:56.020 --> 35:59.272
I always told you

35:59.340 --> 36:02.225
that mommy would
take care of everything.

36:14.622 --> 36:15.622
It's ok.

36:34.024 --> 36:35.977
"Live so that when

36:36.002 --> 36:37.893
your children think of
fairness and integrity,

36:37.895 --> 36:39.479
they think of you."

36:39.962 --> 36:41.879
H. Jackson Brown Jr.

36:49.305 --> 36:51.556
I know there's no handbook,

36:51.624 --> 36:56.078
but what kind of parents
do that for their kid?

36:56.145 --> 36:59.081
Well, the Collinses obviously
had issues before Jeffrey,

36:59.148 --> 37:01.583
but the accident
and his paralysis

37:01.651 --> 37:04.586
pushed it over the edge.

37:04.654 --> 37:07.539
I guess so.

37:08.658 --> 37:12.077
So, what time should I
pick up Jack tomorrow?

37:12.161 --> 37:15.213
I have to leave by 5 a.m.

37:16.332 --> 37:19.134
Ok. Well, I tell you what.

37:19.201 --> 37:21.386
You put on the coffee
and I'll be there.

37:21.454 --> 37:23.472
Thanks.

37:24.640 --> 37:26.241
So you nervous?

37:26.309 --> 37:29.778
I mean, it's not too late
to back out.

37:31.164 --> 37:33.832
I'm ready.

37:33.900 --> 37:35.450
Maybe.

37:39.439 --> 37:41.089
Ohh.

37:41.157 --> 37:43.442
Still no sitter?

37:43.526 --> 37:45.444
My sitter
is not available.

37:45.528 --> 37:47.946
Apparently I have a better chance
of winning the lottery

37:48.030 --> 37:49.815
than getting a sitter
on a Saturday night.

37:49.882 --> 37:51.232
What's going on
tonight?

37:51.284 --> 37:53.234
Oh, it was
ladies night, but--

37:53.286 --> 37:54.503
I forgot
to book a sitter.

37:54.570 --> 37:55.904
I'll do it.

37:55.955 --> 37:57.222
Spence.

37:57.290 --> 38:00.074
What? I've seen an episode
of "Mr. Belvedere."

38:01.127 --> 38:04.079
You've never babysat
by yourself before.

38:04.147 --> 38:05.079
You know--uh--

38:05.131 --> 38:07.616
he could do
a couple of hours.

38:07.683 --> 38:09.201
What could possibly
go wrong?

38:24.383 --> 38:27.119
Whoo!

38:28.654 --> 38:31.923
Whoo! Whoo!

38:31.991 --> 38:33.942
A couple hours.
A couple hours.

38:33.993 --> 38:35.944
You guys didn't come home
till sunrise.

38:35.995 --> 38:37.278
Why are you yelling?

38:37.330 --> 38:38.580
Make him stop.

38:38.631 --> 38:39.781
Ok, hey, Jack, Jack.

38:39.832 --> 38:41.266
Earmuffs for a minute.
Earmuffs.

38:41.334 --> 38:43.668
What did you guys drink
last night?

38:43.753 --> 38:45.504
The green fairy.
You're in the FBI.

38:45.571 --> 38:48.306
Could you get the entire crowd
to stop cheering?

38:48.391 --> 38:51.193
By my estimates, Hotch will be
finishing any minute.

38:51.260 --> 38:52.327
Do you see him, Uncle Dave?

38:52.395 --> 38:53.979
I think I do, kiddo.

38:54.063 --> 38:55.463
Right there!
There he is!

38:56.766 --> 38:57.966
Waaah!

38:59.385 --> 39:02.554
There he is! Come on!

39:02.622 --> 39:04.673
Yeah! Come on!

39:04.740 --> 39:06.208
Get in there!

39:06.275 --> 39:07.574
Whoa!

39:07.575 --> 39:08.492
Come on, Jack.
Come on, Jack.

39:08.560 --> 39:11.128
Let's go see your dad, Jack.

39:16.801 --> 39:19.736
Go get him, Jack!
Go get him! Go, go, go!

39:19.804 --> 39:20.754
Go! Go, go!

39:20.822 --> 39:23.390
Thank you.

39:23.457 --> 39:24.391
You did it!

39:24.458 --> 39:26.343
I did, buddy, I did.
Can you believe it?

39:26.427 --> 39:28.128
Did you see my sign?

39:28.179 --> 39:29.396
I did. That's
for you, buddy.

39:29.463 --> 39:30.547
Your sign's fantastic.

39:30.615 --> 39:31.965
Look at you.
How do you feel?

39:32.016 --> 39:33.867
I think I'm gonna live.

39:33.935 --> 39:35.869
That's pretty impressive.
I had money on the swim killing you.

39:35.937 --> 39:37.321
I practiced.

39:37.405 --> 39:38.655
And it paid off.
Good job.

39:38.740 --> 39:39.656
Thank you.

39:39.741 --> 39:41.158
Hey, you guys want
something to eat?

39:41.242 --> 39:42.860
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, something greasy.

39:42.944 --> 39:44.344
Hotchner!

39:44.412 --> 39:46.146
Beth! Jack, there's someone
I want you to meet.

39:46.197 --> 39:47.764
Come here.

39:49.417 --> 39:50.501
You were amazing!

39:50.585 --> 39:51.735
Congratulations!

39:51.803 --> 39:53.036
Thanks.

39:55.206 --> 39:58.158
Beth, I'd like you
to meet my son Jack.

39:58.209 --> 39:59.626
Hi.
Jack, this is my friend Beth.

39:59.677 --> 40:01.461
Hey there, Jack.

40:01.513 --> 40:02.796
It's nice to meet you.

40:02.847 --> 40:04.331
Do you work
with my dad, too?

40:04.382 --> 40:06.333
No. We're just friends.

40:06.384 --> 40:08.936
Hey, don't tell me
you made that.

40:09.003 --> 40:12.890
Yep. I colored it myself and put
the sparkles on, too.

40:12.974 --> 40:13.891
You know what?

40:13.958 --> 40:15.392
I look at art
all day long,

40:15.476 --> 40:17.711
and that, my friend,
is pretty good.

40:17.779 --> 40:18.695
Thank you.

40:18.780 --> 40:20.113
Well, you're welcome.

40:20.181 --> 40:21.865
We were gonna go get something to eat.
You want to come?

40:21.950 --> 40:23.033
Sure.

40:23.117 --> 40:24.117
Ok. Great.

40:24.185 --> 40:25.402
Come on, buddy.
