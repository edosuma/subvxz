<i>Tango Foxtrot closing
in, attempt is 100 yards.</i>

02:13.723 --> 02:17.527
<i>You have to go.
I repeat, you have to go.</i>

02:17.561 --> 02:19.497
Target is on
the other side of this clearing.

02:20.497 --> 02:21.966
Petro, Vandewege,

02:22.733 --> 02:23.901
go on.

02:23.933 --> 02:25.335
Take the right.

02:25.368 --> 02:27.038
Snowden and Silva,
you're with me.

02:27.070 --> 02:28.272
We got this, brother.

02:29.006 --> 02:30.540
We always got this.

02:54.731 --> 02:55.733
It's hard.

02:57.067 --> 02:58.436
It's hard.

03:03.606 --> 03:06.743
Taking fire!

03:16.419 --> 03:18.756
- Daddy?
- Hmm?

03:18.788 --> 03:22.025
- You'll help them?
- Help who, honey?

03:23.394 --> 03:25.430
Those children, they're sad.

03:28.598 --> 03:30.867
<i>For just
30 cents a day.</i>

03:30.901 --> 03:33.471
<i>Less than one cup of coffee.</i>

03:33.503 --> 03:34.971
What does your
daddy do for a living?

03:36.973 --> 03:38.108
Child protection.

03:38.141 --> 03:39.977
So, what do you think
I wanna do?

03:41.444 --> 03:42.579
Help them?

03:43.847 --> 03:45.383
Exactly.

03:47.484 --> 03:50.054
<i>Hello, everybody,
And thank you for coming out today.</i>

03:50.086 --> 03:52.856
<i>Now being a more than
occasional reader...</i>

03:54.525 --> 03:56.560
Why'd you do that?

03:56.592 --> 04:00.663
There's a lot of bad things
going on in the world, babe.

04:00.697 --> 04:03.568
Got to protect energy
at this house at all costs.

04:05.502 --> 04:07.438
You know what?

04:07.471 --> 04:10.108
Let's go get dressed so we can
have some breakfast. Bring it in.

04:12.443 --> 04:14.578
Shh.

04:14.610 --> 04:18.815
Father God, thank you for this
meal and thank you for this moment.

04:18.848 --> 04:22.752
Being able to eat
what we want when we want,

04:22.786 --> 04:26.656
where we want and with whom
we want. Thank you.

04:27.458 --> 04:29.794
- Amen.
- Amen.

04:29.826 --> 04:34.865
And please, Lord, help Daddy save the
sad children inside the bad places.

04:36.899 --> 04:38.635
That's really sweet of you.

04:42.072 --> 04:47.545
And Lord, please bring
Mommy home.

04:54.617 --> 04:55.819
Amen.

04:55.853 --> 04:56.920
Amen.

05:26.283 --> 05:30.721
<i>Some of you have preferred
to be smug and greedy,</i>

05:30.754 --> 05:36.994
<i>but let me ask you, would someone
greedy build this? Come on, man.</i>

05:37.026 --> 05:41.231
<i>This store is more than just a store.
Nelson's is a symbol...</i>

05:44.033 --> 05:47.904
<i>A symbol of all the opportunity
I've created and provided.</i>

06:07.557 --> 06:09.927
You had 18 years, Pops.

06:16.899 --> 06:18.835
I'll make sure he pays for this.

07:04.982 --> 07:06.917
Hey, girl, what's up?
I'm at work. You good?

07:06.949 --> 07:10.286
Yeah. Calling to see if you want
to have cousins dinner tonight.

07:10.319 --> 07:12.689
It's your birthday, <i>chica.</i>

07:14.091 --> 07:16.561
- Sunny, my birthday was a week ago.
- <i>What?</i>

07:17.394 --> 07:19.295
We can still celebrate.

07:19.329 --> 07:21.632
<i>I'll try, but I'm buried
in bile over here.</i>

07:21.665 --> 07:25.135
All right, well, if not,
at least come by in the morning.

07:25.168 --> 07:27.805
Sam's doing his
big giveaway tomorrow.

07:27.838 --> 07:29.707
<i>In fact, bring Kyle with you.</i>

07:29.740 --> 07:31.975
Oh, yeah.
I'm sure he'd love that.

07:32.009 --> 07:34.278
- I'll try to make it, okay?
- Okay.

07:34.310 --> 07:35.680
- Bye, <i>chica.</i>
- Bye bye.

07:37.014 --> 07:38.816
Sunny says hi.

07:38.848 --> 07:42.319
- Tell her I said hello.
- Uh-huh.

07:42.351 --> 07:46.322
I got a call from a guy who says
he has a little Spanish boy,

07:46.355 --> 07:49.759
parents just disappeared.

07:49.793 --> 07:54.230
Just wondering if you could go with me in the
morning to help me with Spanish a little?

07:54.264 --> 07:56.133
Yeah, sure thing.

08:02.271 --> 08:05.108
I'm gonna head out early.

08:05.141 --> 08:08.646
Got some stuff I need to
take care of at the house.

08:14.117 --> 08:16.186
Please consider
more security if you want

08:16.218 --> 08:18.021
to keep doing
these public appearances, Sam.

08:18.055 --> 08:20.357
You're all the security
I need, Sparks.

08:20.389 --> 08:23.760
I don't want to seem like a big
shot surrounded by a bunch of suits.

08:23.793 --> 08:25.962
You know, we're going for
a man of the people.

08:25.995 --> 08:30.366
Think, it's an election year
and my customers are my voters

08:30.399 --> 08:34.170
and they love me and they love
getting their shit for cheap.

08:34.203 --> 08:37.073
They're saying it's getting kind
of dangerous out there, isn't it?

08:37.106 --> 08:39.943
- I'm not the President.
- Yeah, but you're on your way to.

08:42.078 --> 08:46.250
Well, let's put it this way. Americans
are crazy, but they're not that crazy.

08:48.150 --> 08:51.921
So, what do you wanna do
about Kyle?

08:55.192 --> 08:58.162
We're just going to swing by,
pick up Angel

08:58.195 --> 09:01.732
and Kyle always has a bug
up his ass or something.

09:01.764 --> 09:02.799
Yeah.

09:08.270 --> 09:09.272
Grandpa.

09:10.139 --> 09:11.141
Where's your dad?

09:11.875 --> 09:12.876
Inside, asleep.

09:28.225 --> 09:30.995
Kyle just...
Sparks, stay with her.

09:32.796 --> 09:37.068
Kyle, Angel is out there completely
unsupervised, all on her own.

09:37.933 --> 09:39.135
Is she ready to go?

09:43.273 --> 09:44.774
What the hell
are you doing here?

09:44.807 --> 09:48.245
Uh, for the slumber party
at Grandpa's house.

09:48.278 --> 09:51.716
You know, before the promotion
at the store tomorrow morning.

09:53.517 --> 09:55.953
Okay, I get it.

09:55.985 --> 10:00.356
Well, you don't care because I'm the man
who married your mother so you hate me.

10:00.389 --> 10:02.793
So it's okay.
I'll deal with it.

10:02.826 --> 10:05.863
But, Jesus, Kyle, don't let her
see you like this.

10:09.566 --> 10:10.768
Get him out.

10:15.138 --> 10:16.841
I know he's got a gun on him.

10:18.140 --> 10:20.543
I don't like guns in my house.
Get him out.

10:20.576 --> 10:24.914
Kyle, I know your wife left you,
and that sucks.

10:24.947 --> 10:26.082
I get it.

10:26.115 --> 10:31.053
But Angel's mother left her,
and that sucks more, okay?

10:31.086 --> 10:33.157
That's what you have
to think about now, son.

10:33.190 --> 10:36.460
And drinking like this.
You never even used to drink at all.

10:36.493 --> 10:39.096
- Do you know what your mother would say?
- Don't talk about my mother.

10:39.129 --> 10:41.831
The kind of hell she would raise
if you saw you

10:41.865 --> 10:44.802
- in this condition.
- Don't talk about my mother

10:51.006 --> 10:54.310
Kyle, your mother was grateful
for everything I did.

10:54.344 --> 10:56.347
I took you both out of poverty.

10:57.614 --> 10:59.850
You're the man in war
because of me.

11:02.284 --> 11:04.254
Where do you come up
with all this shit?

11:05.623 --> 11:10.060
You know what, Kyle? I think you
need to find your purpose again.

11:12.128 --> 11:14.565
A purpose is what makes
a man great.

11:20.336 --> 11:22.139
I had a lot of shit on my mind.

11:25.609 --> 11:28.011
I'm doing the best I can.

11:28.043 --> 11:31.148
Yeah. You know,
what scares me, Kyle,

11:31.181 --> 11:35.386
is sometimes your best
is the worst I've ever seen.

12:12.221 --> 12:13.624
All right. Let's do this.

12:33.943 --> 12:35.378
So Janine just left?

12:36.379 --> 12:38.182
No reason, no nothing?

12:38.948 --> 12:40.984
Nope, nada.

12:42.652 --> 12:43.888
Wow.

12:45.254 --> 12:47.124
Is Angel okay?

12:47.157 --> 12:51.629
Yeah, she's okay. I mean,
this all gets difficult at times but...

12:53.964 --> 12:56.667
Guess it's a blessing
that she's still so young.

12:56.700 --> 12:58.269
You know
that's not how that works.

13:01.437 --> 13:02.438
I'm sorry.

13:03.105 --> 13:05.241
- I'll shut up.
- It's okay.

13:06.442 --> 13:08.177
You're just looking out for her.

13:09.980 --> 13:12.081
It's why you're so good
at your job.

13:14.116 --> 13:17.019
I can't help myself.
I just wanna save every kid I can.

13:17.052 --> 13:18.121
We help them.

13:19.389 --> 13:21.125
We don't save them.

13:22.392 --> 13:25.528
That's the way we have to think
of this in order to survive.

13:33.535 --> 13:35.104
I know you don't believe that.

13:40.009 --> 13:41.278
You know who
Saint Christopher is?

13:46.349 --> 13:49.152
They say he carried a child
across a dangerous river.

13:49.184 --> 13:53.622
They got to the other side,
that child revealed himself to be Jesus.

13:53.655 --> 13:58.194
So now Saint Christopher is known as
the patron saint of safe journeys.

13:58.227 --> 14:00.563
I think we've got
to be like him.

14:00.596 --> 14:04.500
We have to believe that every single
child out there is worth saving.

14:06.635 --> 14:07.737
Here.

14:09.205 --> 14:10.507
- Take this.
- Clove...

14:10.539 --> 14:14.211
- No.
- You're on a rough journey right now. Maybe this will help.

14:28.291 --> 14:29.326
Thank you.

15:06.428 --> 15:08.631
You're the
child services people.

15:08.664 --> 15:10.567
I'm the caseworker
you spoke to earlier.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.470
Yes. This is my colleague.
Clove Martinez.

15:13.503 --> 15:15.072
About time you got here.

15:15.105 --> 15:17.274
So is the child injured, hungry?

15:17.307 --> 15:18.709
- Afraid?
- What do you mean?

15:18.741 --> 15:21.077
I didn't hurt him, all right.
I didn't cook breakfast for the kid,

15:21.110 --> 15:23.279
- but he didn't ask for anything.
- Okay, sir. Let's calm down. Okay?

15:23.312 --> 15:24.514
What the fuck you talking about?
I'm calm.

15:24.547 --> 15:26.682
Sir, do not talk
to my colleague like that.

15:28.183 --> 15:30.187
Me and you spoke earlier.

15:30.220 --> 15:33.322
You said that the parents left
the child in your custody, right?

15:33.355 --> 15:37.626
It's just a dad and a kid,
but the dad freaks out, disappears.

15:37.659 --> 15:39.328
Where's the kid now?

15:39.361 --> 15:42.131
Somewhere inside.
I keep him in the basement.

15:42.164 --> 15:44.300
- If I let him up...
- You keep him in the basement?

15:44.333 --> 15:46.702
But he's got a knife.
He tried to hurt me.

15:46.735 --> 15:48.605
All right? What if he tries
to use one of my guns?

15:48.638 --> 15:50.540
You keep guns in the house
with a child?

15:50.572 --> 15:52.007
It's my God damn house.

15:52.041 --> 15:54.611
If you don't like it, you can get
this kid out of my house right now.

15:56.278 --> 15:58.548
- What's the child's name?
- Manny.

16:02.184 --> 16:03.186
Manny.

16:06.322 --> 16:07.323
Come on out, kid.

16:07.356 --> 16:10.693
- Don't yell at the kid, okay?
- I'm not yelling.

16:10.726 --> 16:12.762
I'm not asking. That's an order.

16:14.197 --> 16:16.667
Stay right here.
You see him?

16:24.206 --> 16:25.208
Is that him?

16:30.279 --> 16:31.380
Manny...

16:32.849 --> 16:35.152
is that knife
to keep you safe?

16:40.889 --> 16:42.826
His dad gave it to him
for protection.

16:43.259 --> 16:45.195
Manny, listen.

16:45.227 --> 16:47.596
You can keep the knife.
It's okay, all right?

16:47.629 --> 16:48.731
We're here to help.

16:56.371 --> 16:57.506
My mom died.

16:59.609 --> 17:01.311
My dad brought me to America.

17:03.379 --> 17:05.248
He said that
if anything happens,

17:07.282 --> 17:09.485
Just stay with the man
until he comes back.

17:12.555 --> 17:15.926
But the man is mean.

17:17.693 --> 17:20.629
Listen, tell him

17:20.663 --> 17:25.268
we're going to do whatever we have to do to
help you to get back to your father, okay?

17:27.869 --> 17:30.639
Okay, come on out.

17:30.673 --> 17:32.741
Christ sake, are you leaving
or what?

17:32.775 --> 17:34.311
Huh? Get this kid out.

17:35.778 --> 17:38.248
Shut the fuck up.
You understand me?

17:38.280 --> 17:40.951
- I'm not playing with you.
- Kyle, stop.

17:42.585 --> 17:43.720
Calm down.

17:48.557 --> 17:49.559
I'm calm.

17:54.497 --> 17:55.932
Go, go, go.

18:21.057 --> 18:22.992
Excuse me, sir.

18:23.026 --> 18:26.230
Hi. I don't think repairs
were scheduled for today.

18:26.663 --> 18:28.464
You are correct.

18:28.498 --> 18:30.701
Just a work mix up.
But we're already done.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.675
Clothes and food is on us,
little man.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.444
You're a hero.

18:41.477 --> 18:44.982
How do you say,
"Little strong man"?

18:52.355 --> 18:53.957
That's you.

18:58.194 --> 19:00.429
Are we gonna let him
keep that knife?

19:00.462 --> 19:02.331
Let's just get him some food.

19:02.365 --> 19:04.634
We'll take care of the knife
in a minute, okay?

19:04.666 --> 19:07.470
- Let's go to Nelson's.
- Clove, no.

19:07.502 --> 19:10.039
- Nelson's is right there, Kyle.
- They're not even open yet.

19:10.073 --> 19:12.642
Come on. He's hungry.

19:12.674 --> 19:15.611
- Send the bill to Sam.
- You know how I feel about Sam.

19:15.644 --> 19:19.548
Ever since I got back,
he calls me weak and a freaking coward.

19:20.449 --> 19:21.951
What happened
to you over there?

19:23.118 --> 19:24.654
You know you can trust me.

19:41.570 --> 19:43.339
It's the worst moment
of my life.

20:04.559 --> 20:05.561
Thank you.

20:06.128 --> 20:08.397
Just breathe. Breathe.

20:12.868 --> 20:15.471
Please, please, please.

21:07.656 --> 21:09.859
You're the only person
I've ever told that to.

21:17.700 --> 21:20.670
I am so sorry
you had to experience that.

21:22.805 --> 21:25.508
You know what?
Since we're so close,

21:25.540 --> 21:28.110
let's just get him something to eat.
We'll be in and out.

21:29.711 --> 21:30.980
But you're paying.

21:49.030 --> 21:51.067
- Can I help you?
- You're the manager?

21:51.099 --> 21:53.535
Yes. My name is Sunshine.
Is there a problem?

21:53.568 --> 21:56.205
I'm Mr. Nelson's press manager.
Can you please do something about them?

21:56.239 --> 21:58.106
I don't want the camera
picking them up.

21:58.140 --> 22:01.778
You want me to tell my employees
to stop doing their jobs?

22:01.810 --> 22:06.148
Well, they're Sam Nelson's
employees, so, yes.

22:06.182 --> 22:09.019
They'll be done and out
of the way by the time we open.

22:20.162 --> 22:22.966
- Eagan.
- Who?

22:22.999 --> 22:27.103
This high school kid Sunny
used to tutor back in the day.

22:27.135 --> 22:30.606
He tells her, he's living in the woods.
He wants her to live with them.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.476
She called the cops.
She never saw him again.

22:33.675 --> 22:34.845
Come on, little man.

22:40.982 --> 22:43.819
It couldn't be him.

22:43.853 --> 22:46.256
He disappeared years ago. It's probably
just somebody who looks like him.

22:48.089 --> 22:49.592
She okay though, right?

22:49.925 --> 22:51.894
Yeah.

22:51.928 --> 22:54.664
What's it with the service?
I'm getting no signal.

22:54.696 --> 22:57.000
- I need my phone.
- There are full bars all the time.

22:57.032 --> 23:00.069
- I don't know why our phone...
- You should provide wifi then.

23:01.703 --> 23:02.771
Yeah.

23:03.638 --> 23:04.640
Hey,

23:07.076 --> 23:09.578
- Hi
- Welcome. Hi.

23:09.612 --> 23:10.980
I'm so sorry,
I missed your birthday

23:11.012 --> 23:15.183
Oh, my God.

23:15.217 --> 23:17.153
- Good to see you.
- Hey.

23:17.185 --> 23:19.154
We have a hungry young man here.

23:19.188 --> 23:21.591
Oh, well, food will be ready
any time.

23:21.624 --> 23:23.593
You want to just go
wander around?

23:23.625 --> 23:25.795
Yeah.

23:25.827 --> 23:28.865
<i>Hey, Sunshine, our clepto in
Home Dec is stuffing her pockets again.</i>

23:28.897 --> 23:31.934
Oh, yeah.
I'm getting her this time

23:39.942 --> 23:41.211
Gotcha.

23:42.377 --> 23:44.079
You little shit.

23:44.113 --> 23:46.316
Hey, whoa, whoa.

23:46.348 --> 23:47.983
You and I are gonna have
a little talk.

23:48.017 --> 23:50.219
What are you doing?
Let go of me!

23:50.251 --> 23:51.788
I was just putting returns back.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.757
Come with me. Now.

23:57.259 --> 23:58.995
What is happening?
I don't understand.

23:59.028 --> 24:00.329
- You don't understand.
- No.

24:01.230 --> 24:02.231
Sit.

24:05.867 --> 24:08.804
Do you know how long I've been
trying to catch you in the act?

24:09.704 --> 24:10.740
What are you talking about?

24:10.772 --> 24:12.875
You're on camera, sweetie.

24:14.042 --> 24:16.378
Now, do I need
to call the police

24:16.412 --> 24:18.815
or are you gonna show me
everything you have on you?

24:29.991 --> 24:31.293
Seriously?

24:32.728 --> 24:33.863
There's more.

24:37.266 --> 24:38.368
I know there's more.

24:43.239 --> 24:46.675
Serial killers, pirate radio,
Halloween...

24:47.843 --> 24:49.211
I don't know.

24:49.244 --> 24:51.980
Sunny and I watched it.
Fun movie.

24:52.013 --> 24:53.349
Definitely not for kids.

24:54.450 --> 24:55.986
Not on my watch.

24:56.317 --> 24:57.787
Nope.

24:57.819 --> 24:59.221
Let me check this rack.

25:00.923 --> 25:02.625
Wow.

25:03.826 --> 25:06.129
The hero always gets the girl.

25:08.998 --> 25:11.768
Howdy, everyone.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.935
This is the one and only,
Sam Nelson.

25:13.969 --> 25:17.206
May I have all the employees
up front?

25:17.239 --> 25:19.209
<i>All the employees up front.</i>

25:31.886 --> 25:33.423
Wow.

25:33.455 --> 25:36.192
- Are you gonna fire me.
- Um, yeah.

25:36.224 --> 25:37.394
<i>Hey, Sunshine. You there?</i>

25:39.461 --> 25:42.231
- What's up, John?
- <i>Did you put a lock on the back door?</i>

25:43.732 --> 25:44.733
What lock?

25:50.205 --> 25:51.773
We're about to open the door.

25:51.807 --> 25:52.976
Everybody up front.

25:53.509 --> 25:54.711
Well, look who's here.

26:01.349 --> 26:05.855
Raffles, giveaways, the whole
shebang, same thing we do every year.

26:10.326 --> 26:12.060
I want you on top of your game.

26:17.133 --> 26:18.468
Angel!

26:32.181 --> 26:33.883
You got any parents I can call?

26:33.915 --> 26:35.951
I'm a foster kid, all right?

26:37.385 --> 26:39.288
Is that your excuse
for being a thief?

26:40.556 --> 26:42.258
- What the hell?
- Shit.

26:43.893 --> 26:45.161
Rainey, where are you?

26:50.865 --> 26:52.501
Shit.

26:56.838 --> 26:57.973
Oh.

26:58.406 --> 27:00.009
You okay?

27:00.041 --> 27:02.077
Back against the wall,
let's go!

27:02.111 --> 27:03.513
Clove? Clove.

27:20.829 --> 27:22.932
- Sam, we're blocked.
- What about the side exit?

27:23.833 --> 27:25.067
Follow me.

27:26.301 --> 27:28.270
Good job, everybody.

27:28.304 --> 27:29.939
Way to to follow orders

27:38.146 --> 27:40.316
Attention shoppers.

27:42.852 --> 27:44.888
Nelson's is now mine.

27:46.888 --> 27:48.857
And you all belong to me.

27:53.596 --> 27:56.566
<i>Doors are packed with C4.</i>

27:56.598 --> 28:00.336
<i>If you try to open them,
you will level this building.</i>

28:03.571 --> 28:07.009
<i>But you can survive all of this
if you do as I say.</i>

28:09.545 --> 28:12.849
Everyone must come to
the front of the store now.

28:14.916 --> 28:21.124
If you hide, we will find you,
and you will be shot.

28:25.361 --> 28:28.298
You hear me, Sam Nelson?

28:30.065 --> 28:32.634
I know you were here.

28:32.667 --> 28:37.339
- <i>Come out, come out, wherever you are Sammy boy.</i>
- No.

28:37.373 --> 28:39.976
You're not going anywhere.
We stay put.

28:40.009 --> 28:42.377
Oh, I almost forgot.

28:42.411 --> 28:47.115
I am also wearing
a suicide vest.

28:50.184 --> 28:53.255
The button in my hand
will detonate everything

28:53.288 --> 28:57.093
if for any reason, my thumb
is raised of his button.

28:57.960 --> 29:02.498
For example, if I'm attacked
or killed.

29:02.530 --> 29:05.434
So be wise and do as I say.

29:05.934 --> 29:08.003
Front of the store.

29:09.070 --> 29:10.439
You have one minute.

29:30.192 --> 29:31.560
What do we do, Sparks?

29:34.163 --> 29:37.532
They're looking for you, Sam.
For all we know, it's to kill you.

29:39.034 --> 29:40.169
Sam.

29:40.201 --> 29:43.906
You're a bargaining tool.
Play ball and they'll let us go.

29:45.273 --> 29:46.975
- Yeah. No, I know.
- No.

29:47.977 --> 29:50.579
Absolutely not.

29:50.612 --> 29:54.150
Yeah, she's right. I can't leave the
employees out there on their own.

29:58.686 --> 29:59.688
Okay.

30:02.023 --> 30:04.559
But stay right next to me.

30:04.593 --> 30:06.262
The moment I think
they're going to shoot,

30:07.061 --> 30:08.063
get out of my way.

30:10.465 --> 30:12.434
Come on. No signal.

30:12.468 --> 30:13.603
We're trapped in here.
We should go.

30:13.635 --> 30:16.605
No, we're staying right here.
The door is reinforced.

30:16.637 --> 30:18.607
- Call 911.
- The line is dead.

30:19.307 --> 30:20.475
Okay.

30:20.509 --> 30:22.010
Something like this
is a good chance

30:22.044 --> 30:25.181
that police are already on their way.
They may even be outside already.

30:27.415 --> 30:30.052
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

30:30.987 --> 30:36.258
Look, my wife and my cousin
are out there.

30:36.290 --> 30:39.294
I won't leave the one safe place
we have if there's a chance of me

30:39.327 --> 30:41.096
getting them in here
with us, okay?

30:43.499 --> 30:45.300
- Okay? You understand?
- Uh-huh.

30:46.101 --> 30:47.303
Okay.

30:56.244 --> 30:57.980
You ready, okay?

31:01.416 --> 31:04.486
- Where's Sunny?
- She's somewhere in the store hiding.

31:04.519 --> 31:06.655
She's here. Okay.
Don't die, please.

31:11.727 --> 31:13.629
I'm not gonna let you die, okay?

31:16.798 --> 31:18.634
Stay with me, Clove.

31:18.666 --> 31:20.168
Stay with me.

31:23.638 --> 31:25.307
You.

31:25.773 --> 31:27.376
Move over there.

31:27.609 --> 31:29.011
Now.

31:32.815 --> 31:36.753
Stop trying to move. Now!
Get against the wall.

31:38.453 --> 31:40.757
I told you to stop trying.

31:56.471 --> 31:58.273
Don't be shy.
Come on down.

31:59.307 --> 32:00.576
Come on. Join the family.

32:04.313 --> 32:06.582
Kyle, you have to save Manny.

32:06.615 --> 32:08.317
I'm gonna get him out of here.

32:11.319 --> 32:12.487
Come out.

32:13.221 --> 32:14.389
Come out.

32:17.659 --> 32:19.295
Manny, no!

32:21.596 --> 32:22.597
Let's go.

32:30.705 --> 32:32.207
I'm not leaving her.

32:34.209 --> 32:37.380
- Move.
- No... Manny.

32:37.813 --> 32:39.182
Let's go!

32:50.291 --> 32:51.793
Faster. Let's go.

33:04.472 --> 33:05.407
Everything okay?

33:05.441 --> 33:07.442
Yeah, some little shit
ran into the store.

33:07.476 --> 33:09.245
- He was scared for his life...
- Shut up.

33:21.656 --> 33:23.326
Angel.

33:26.862 --> 33:28.598
Just stay right there, okay?

33:29.932 --> 33:31.866
I don't see anybody.

33:31.900 --> 33:34.470
Sunshine.

33:34.502 --> 33:36.471
- Sunshine, please.
- Mikki?

33:36.505 --> 33:37.907
Please.

33:39.575 --> 33:40.809
Thanks. Hurry.

33:50.251 --> 33:51.553
Come here.

33:52.653 --> 33:54.156
You're okay.

33:55.523 --> 33:57.259
You're safe.

33:57.893 --> 33:59.862
Where is Sam Nelson?

34:01.963 --> 34:04.900
Our great Congressman,
Sam Nelson.

34:06.734 --> 34:11.239
The multimillionaire founder
of Nelson's Corporation.

34:12.340 --> 34:15.476
Businessman Sam Nelson.

34:15.510 --> 34:21.551
Loyal friend, father,
grandfather and foodie.

34:26.420 --> 34:27.422
Step aside.

34:29.858 --> 34:32.862
Sparks, it's okay. It's okay.

34:35.030 --> 34:36.465
It's okay, Sparks.

34:44.672 --> 34:45.674
Congressman.

34:46.541 --> 34:47.876
Right this way.

34:47.909 --> 34:49.612
Go with Sophie.

34:53.715 --> 34:54.817
Where's the cameraman?

34:55.884 --> 34:58.586
The one in black.

34:58.619 --> 35:01.257
- Start recording now.
- What is this, God damn it?

35:01.289 --> 35:05.027
- It's confession time, Congressman.
- What? Confess what?

35:05.059 --> 35:07.862
You're going to look into
that camera and tell the world

35:07.896 --> 35:09.798
that you framed
your business partner.

35:09.831 --> 35:11.567
I don't have a business partner.

35:11.599 --> 35:14.369
You admit to what you did
or all these people die.

35:16.471 --> 35:18.541
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

35:21.076 --> 35:24.280
- Tell us about Luther Raize.
- Luther Raize?

35:24.313 --> 35:26.615
Jesus, he embezzled money
from me.

35:26.648 --> 35:29.719
I haven't thought about
that loser in 20 years.

35:31.585 --> 35:33.721
- What are you doing?
- Sparks.

35:33.755 --> 35:36.425
Please just think
about my daughter.

35:40.896 --> 35:42.898
I can't risk Sam getting killed.

35:42.931 --> 35:43.999
Stop.

35:44.032 --> 35:45.434
Sparks, no!

35:48.436 --> 35:49.438
Back up.

35:51.773 --> 35:53.709
Come on.

35:53.742 --> 35:55.711
Come on. You want to blow
this place up?

36:01.983 --> 36:03.653
You're bluffing.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.289
Only one way
to find out, bodyguard.

36:08.090 --> 36:09.858
Daddy.

36:11.659 --> 36:13.728
Sparks, put the gun down.

36:15.097 --> 36:17.466
- He's lying, Sam.
- Sparks, please.

36:31.746 --> 36:32.780
No just...

36:55.871 --> 36:57.573
Please, please.

37:07.615 --> 37:10.052
How many more people
are gonna die because of you?

37:27.469 --> 37:28.804
Sunny.

37:30.704 --> 37:32.940
- Rainey.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

37:32.974 --> 37:34.843
Rainey, thank God you're okay.

37:34.876 --> 37:36.945
We're in the security office.
You have to get here.

37:36.978 --> 37:39.715
- I can't.
- Let's go.

37:39.748 --> 37:40.750
<i>Rainey.</i>

37:44.719 --> 37:46.621
One of you is dying next.

37:48.222 --> 37:49.491
You.

37:52.827 --> 37:54.829
I got no problem with you.

37:54.862 --> 37:56.764
What? I can't hear you.
What'd you say?

37:56.797 --> 37:58.633
I ain't got no problem with you.

38:00.001 --> 38:01.236
Good.

38:01.268 --> 38:04.406
You don't mind dying if Sam
Nelson doesn't start talking.

38:06.775 --> 38:08.210
What's going on?

38:08.242 --> 38:10.078
Sunshine's in the
security office.

38:22.123 --> 38:23.692
Ready for your confession?

38:35.637 --> 38:37.172
What's he doing?

38:37.204 --> 38:39.574
Probably delivering
his manifesto.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.844
Psychotic narcissists
love that shit.

38:43.878 --> 38:46.014
Exactly one hour from now,

38:46.047 --> 38:48.784
a series of blasts will bring
this place to the ground...

38:50.918 --> 38:53.654
unless I see on the news,
a prosecutor

38:53.688 --> 38:56.724
bring charges against
Congressman Sam Nelson.

38:58.827 --> 39:00.129
Kyle.

39:01.896 --> 39:03.032
Something you know?

39:07.202 --> 39:12.608
As a sign of good faith.
I will release some hostages.

39:12.641 --> 39:17.780
But if anyone tries to enter or
negotiate with me, I will kill everyone.

39:19.581 --> 39:20.583
Clocks are ticking.

39:24.985 --> 39:26.153
You got that?

39:26.186 --> 39:28.523
Yeah, it recorded.

39:30.759 --> 39:32.027
All right. Here's the deal.

39:33.728 --> 39:35.797
Some of you are gonna go home.

39:35.829 --> 39:39.567
Some of you are going to stay
here and help me. Any volunteers?

39:45.172 --> 39:46.174
All right.

39:49.677 --> 39:51.547
You all are staying.

39:53.114 --> 39:55.918
You get that recording
to the police today.

40:00.021 --> 40:01.090
Let's go.

40:01.889 --> 40:03.525
Let's go!

40:05.594 --> 40:06.862
Move!

40:24.079 --> 40:25.314
That means you too.

40:29.918 --> 40:31.887
Nice and slow.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.923
Take Sam and the others
to electronics.

40:53.842 --> 40:54.843
Wait.

40:58.213 --> 41:00.015
- I know you.
- Why are you doing this?

41:00.047 --> 41:03.250
I know you. Don't I?

41:03.284 --> 41:10.692
You're the black stepson with a cute little
girl who got Sam Nelson the minority vote.

41:10.724 --> 41:15.264
Me and my daughter, don't have anything
to do with Sam and his politics.

41:16.764 --> 41:19.902
Tell me is that Mexican boy
he yours too?

41:31.913 --> 41:36.652
- I work for Child Protective Services.
- Kids don't need protection.

41:36.684 --> 41:38.920
A man like you came for me
when I was a boy,

41:39.621 --> 41:41.889
and I wouldn't let him take me.

41:41.922 --> 41:44.058
I'm a product of chaos.

41:44.092 --> 41:48.430
And violence is the only voice
that a man hears.

41:48.463 --> 41:50.798
You know that. I know that.

41:58.005 --> 42:00.408
So I take it this ain't
your first time doing this.

42:04.112 --> 42:05.114
Come here.

42:09.717 --> 42:12.953
- Come on, baby. Just stay with your daddy.
- Now.

42:12.987 --> 42:15.289
Daddy's gonna work it out.

42:16.224 --> 42:17.760
Why don't you read this?

42:40.347 --> 42:41.349
"Remembered?"

42:42.851 --> 42:44.885
Past tense?

42:44.918 --> 42:46.954
I want you to give that
to the police.

42:47.755 --> 42:49.223
Today is your lucky day.

42:50.291 --> 42:51.960
You both get to go home.

42:53.894 --> 42:56.030
Everyone back. Back.

42:58.900 --> 43:02.371
That recording that needs to get out to the
police. So make sure you get a copy fast.

43:06.141 --> 43:08.143
Sir, listen.

43:08.809 --> 43:10.778
I get it. You have a message.

43:10.811 --> 43:12.847
Surely we can deal
for Mr. Nelson's safety.

43:13.481 --> 43:15.050
I've had criminal clients.

43:15.083 --> 43:18.487
- I've gotten very good re...
- You work for Sam?

43:18.519 --> 43:22.724
I'm a personal media and communications
manager, not a Nelson's employee.

43:27.362 --> 43:30.365
Because now, you belong to me.

43:36.905 --> 43:38.340
Move. Let's go.

43:41.442 --> 43:42.945
You're next. Let's go.

43:43.878 --> 43:45.180
You. Move.

43:49.317 --> 43:50.351
Listen.

43:51.885 --> 43:53.288
Everything's gonna be all right.

43:54.121 --> 43:56.390
I need you to go outside
with this woman.

43:56.423 --> 43:58.326
She's gonna keep you safe, okay?

43:58.358 --> 43:59.927
What about Grandpa?

44:02.896 --> 44:05.032
I got him.

44:05.065 --> 44:09.003
I got everybody. I'm gonna go back
in there, make sure everybody's okay.

44:09.737 --> 44:12.273
- Please.
- Let's go, slow.

44:12.306 --> 44:14.142
Take care of her for me.

44:27.889 --> 44:28.891
Look at that.

44:33.126 --> 44:34.862
Jesus, Kyle.

44:36.965 --> 44:39.434
I swear that guy
looks like my CPS officer.

45:36.523 --> 45:37.960
Y'all got one out.

45:40.994 --> 45:42.130
One out.

45:43.331 --> 45:45.133
Come on, Rainey.

45:45.166 --> 45:47.169
Where are you?
I need to know you're okay.

45:52.673 --> 45:54.242
How do you know so much
about people?

45:56.110 --> 45:57.346
I'm a psychologist.

46:02.550 --> 46:05.053
I moved back here to

46:05.085 --> 46:07.955
be with Rainey while
she finishes veterinary school.

46:09.423 --> 46:11.326
I tried to give it
a shot here, but...

46:13.094 --> 46:14.563
I knew it was a long shot but...

46:15.563 --> 46:16.898
It must be hard.

46:18.099 --> 46:20.035
Yeah.

46:20.068 --> 46:22.170
But I'd do anything for her.

46:35.382 --> 46:37.151
Did my granddaughter get out?

46:37.184 --> 46:38.286
Of course she did.

46:38.318 --> 46:40.221
Did I? No.

46:44.425 --> 46:46.127
What? Are you kidding me?

46:46.159 --> 46:49.096
You're one of my employees.

46:49.130 --> 46:50.699
I was never one of your slaves.

46:54.335 --> 46:56.737
All right, team.

46:56.771 --> 46:59.441
This is the outsourcing
part of our adventure.

46:59.474 --> 47:01.443
Before I send you home,

47:01.476 --> 47:03.979
I got a little shopping
I need you all to complete.

47:05.213 --> 47:07.015
Let the work set you free.

47:08.516 --> 47:10.251
Let's go. Start movin'.

47:12.186 --> 47:13.689
Turn the TV on.

47:20.494 --> 47:21.730
Oh, the lesbo.

47:22.630 --> 47:24.199
The one with Sunshine.

47:25.532 --> 47:27.969
So tell me,
where is our little Sunshine?

47:29.237 --> 47:31.373
What's that little secret
you're hiding from me?

47:35.143 --> 47:39.114
You are the sunshine of my life.

47:39.146 --> 47:41.148
Didn't take you
as a Stevie Wonder fan.

47:42.315 --> 47:43.617
It's a Sinatra song.

47:44.117 --> 47:46.253
I stand corrected.

47:46.286 --> 47:48.655
Well, if you wanna
keep standing,

47:48.688 --> 47:50.357
you better tell me where she is.

47:50.391 --> 47:53.128
I swear.
I don't know where she is.

47:56.731 --> 47:59.468
I know you've been talking
to her in the security office.

48:00.802 --> 48:02.671
And I know it's reinforced.

48:07.641 --> 48:10.277
We'll get her to come out
one way or another.

48:12.847 --> 48:14.115
No?

48:16.751 --> 48:18.387
You're staying here with me.

48:44.846 --> 48:48.817
<i>The scene here at the Nelson
Store is escalating rapidly.</i>

48:48.849 --> 48:51.452
<i>While police
are still securing the area,</i>

48:51.485 --> 48:55.389
<i>demands have already
been received from inside,</i>

48:55.422 --> 49:00.561
<i>which suggests this very dangerous
situation could come to an end quickly...</i>

49:00.594 --> 49:02.696
You two go check the perimeter.

49:02.730 --> 49:04.132
I know the kid's still out there

49:04.164 --> 49:07.601
and I wanna make sure no one else
is trying to get their way out.

49:07.635 --> 49:09.704
What we do if we find someone?

49:13.541 --> 49:14.909
Kill him.

49:14.943 --> 49:17.612
If you don't have the balls to do
it, hold them till I get there.

49:20.581 --> 49:22.182
Showtime.

49:22.215 --> 49:24.184
<i>...act of terrorism</i>

49:24.217 --> 49:27.254
<i>or is it the violence
of disgruntled employees?</i>

49:27.288 --> 49:30.757
<i>To answer that, we go to a
video that has just surfaced...</i>

49:30.791 --> 49:33.628
Our moment of truth, Sam.

49:33.661 --> 49:35.229
<i>My name is Sam Nelson.</i>

49:35.262 --> 49:40.701
<i>Fifteen years ago, I framed my friend
and business partner, Luther Raize.</i>

49:40.735 --> 49:42.170
<i>He was an innocent man,</i>

49:42.202 --> 49:47.809
<i>but I made sure he spent most of
the rest of his life in prison.</i>

49:47.842 --> 49:51.713
<i>And that was only the first
of my many crimes.</i>

49:59.820 --> 50:01.422
<i>Police are telling us</i>

50:01.454 --> 50:05.326
<i>that there may be
up to three gunmen inside.</i>

50:05.358 --> 50:08.596
- What do we do with all this stuff?
- Shh.

50:08.628 --> 50:11.565
<i>Exactly one hour from
now, a series of blasts</i>

50:11.599 --> 50:14.702
<i>will bring this place
to the ground.</i>

50:14.735 --> 50:17.472
- So how'd we do?
- <i>Unless I see on the news...</i>

50:17.505 --> 50:19.207
Good work, team.

50:19.239 --> 50:22.409
<i>...bring charges against
Congressman Sam Nelson...</i>

50:22.842 --> 50:24.211
Now...

50:26.280 --> 50:27.615
you take those.

50:28.916 --> 50:30.719
I'd like you to tie her up.

50:37.425 --> 50:39.260
I'd like you to tie
your friend there too.

50:40.728 --> 50:41.863
Mmm.

50:55.342 --> 50:57.178
What are you doing, asshole?

50:58.346 --> 50:59.646
Give yourself up.

50:59.679 --> 51:01.682
You got it coming, old man.

51:11.692 --> 51:13.295
Next time I won't miss.

51:34.882 --> 51:37.251
I knew something was up,
but he's crazier than I thought.

51:37.284 --> 51:39.420
Jeb! What are you doing?

51:56.836 --> 51:58.204
Why are you all doing this?

51:58.239 --> 52:01.309
We're gonna burn this place to the
ground for what Sam did to Luther.

52:01.342 --> 52:03.478
So you're all doing
all of this for Luther?

52:04.378 --> 52:06.648
- Why?
- He saved us.

52:10.083 --> 52:11.485
Don't move.

52:13.586 --> 52:15.922
Don't move or I'll shoot.

52:15.956 --> 52:17.392
Do it!

52:20.661 --> 52:21.796
Oh, my God.

52:22.996 --> 52:24.498
You can't do it.

52:36.409 --> 52:38.312
You had it coming, old man.

52:42.416 --> 52:43.684
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

52:44.851 --> 52:46.487
<i>Kyle, it's Sunshine.</i>

52:47.822 --> 52:49.957
- Sunshine?
- Yes.

52:49.989 --> 52:51.892
Sunshine, where are you?

52:51.925 --> 52:53.927
<i>We're in the security office.
We're safe.</i>

52:55.563 --> 52:58.099
- Who's we?
- Me, me, Mikki Foss.

52:58.132 --> 52:59.867
You know,
Mikki "Sticky Fingers."

53:01.802 --> 53:03.605
You all see me right now?

53:05.139 --> 53:06.541
Totally.

53:15.750 --> 53:16.751
Why?

53:17.585 --> 53:18.920
Why are you doing this?

53:20.653 --> 53:23.391
Because all the wrong people
get all the best things in life.

53:24.492 --> 53:25.894
Nice jobs.

53:26.693 --> 53:27.929
The most money.

53:30.030 --> 53:32.432
Women.

53:32.465 --> 53:35.369
And people like you get all
the preference and opportunity

53:35.402 --> 53:38.439
while hardworking white men
get used up and die.

53:39.440 --> 53:40.708
Preference?

53:41.574 --> 53:43.009
I go to vet school,

53:43.043 --> 53:45.914
I'm in debt,
and I work at Nelson's.

53:46.847 --> 53:49.050
Not anymore.

53:49.083 --> 53:52.619
I'm gonna take everything he's
got if it's the last thing I do.

53:52.652 --> 53:54.621
If it's
the last thing you do.

53:54.655 --> 53:58.426
You wanna get back at him.
Not at us.

53:58.458 --> 54:00.861
- Let us go.
- Not yet.

54:02.996 --> 54:05.132
I want Sunshine
to come and get you.

54:12.072 --> 54:14.041
<i>Listen to me.</i>

54:14.074 --> 54:15.643
<i>I need you to stay right there.</i>

54:15.675 --> 54:17.811
Don't move from that office.
Hear me?

54:17.844 --> 54:18.913
<i>Got it.</i>

54:21.081 --> 54:22.650
Kyle, Kyle.

54:22.682 --> 54:24.152
One of them
is coming toward you.

54:24.851 --> 54:26.855
What? Where?

54:28.456 --> 54:29.958
<i>Two aisles ahead of you.</i>

54:31.759 --> 54:34.027
Okay, get off the mic right now.

55:43.597 --> 55:44.999
Damn, he's a badass.

55:45.298 --> 55:46.634
Yeah.

56:03.217 --> 56:05.619
Everything's going
according to plan.

56:05.652 --> 56:08.689
I know. And we go out before
anyone knows what happened.

56:11.724 --> 56:14.094
I wanna get back
to the farm.

56:14.128 --> 56:15.830
Stay true to the family.

56:16.963 --> 56:18.599
Farm it is.

56:18.632 --> 56:20.735
Let's bring Jeb and Shane
with us.

56:20.768 --> 56:21.970
Where are they?

56:24.771 --> 56:26.007
Will this do any good?

56:31.077 --> 56:32.679
You got balls.

56:34.782 --> 56:37.785
<i>Kyle, we have to be
careful now, more than ever.</i>

56:37.818 --> 56:39.954
<i>I know, I know.
Where are they?</i>

56:39.987 --> 56:41.556
Electronics.

56:43.157 --> 56:44.859
Please tell me Clove got out.

56:55.603 --> 56:56.971
I'm so sorry, Sunny.

57:00.173 --> 57:01.309
She's gone.

57:03.376 --> 57:05.045
<i>I promise I tried.</i>

57:36.210 --> 57:38.646
Sunny, listen to me.

57:41.081 --> 57:42.983
<i>We have to get
everybody out.</i>

57:43.817 --> 57:44.851
<i>Now.</i>

57:49.757 --> 57:52.126
<i>He's gonna blow himself up.</i>

57:53.393 --> 57:56.163
<i>There's explosives
all around the store.</i>

57:58.264 --> 58:00.033
<i>We only have 30 minutes.</i>

58:05.039 --> 58:06.908
I need you.

58:07.307 --> 58:08.710
We need you.

58:13.012 --> 58:14.081
<i>Hello?</i>

58:20.186 --> 58:21.221
<i>Sunny.</i>

58:21.855 --> 58:24.659
<i>He's gonna kill my stepdad</i>

58:24.692 --> 58:26.728
<i>and everyone connected to him.</i>

58:28.161 --> 58:30.063
<i>He's making some statement.</i>

58:39.172 --> 58:41.708
He's not gonna blow himself up.

58:41.742 --> 58:43.944
<i>What do you mean?</i>

58:43.976 --> 58:46.647
Suicides don't take
cash and jewelry.

58:50.983 --> 58:52.920
It's time for phase three.

58:52.952 --> 58:54.355
Everybody, up!

58:55.322 --> 58:56.724
Good.

58:57.891 --> 58:59.193
I see you're listening!

59:00.193 --> 59:02.362
You, you come over here!

59:04.431 --> 59:06.067
What about those two?

59:08.034 --> 59:10.103
No, you two stay.

59:10.137 --> 59:12.972
He made them take
money from the registers,

59:13.005 --> 59:15.775
<i>jewelry from the cases.</i>

59:15.809 --> 59:18.846
If he's saying this is a suicide
bombing, he's full of shit.

59:35.461 --> 59:37.364
Kyle, wait. No.

59:37.396 --> 59:40.000
- What's going on?
- You have to go back. Hide.

59:45.938 --> 59:47.074
Stop!

59:50.309 --> 59:52.212
What the fuck
are you all looking at?

1:00:01.954 --> 1:00:03.324
He's coming right at you.

1:00:17.838 --> 1:00:19.306
He's in Home Goods.

1:00:19.338 --> 1:00:21.275
Kyle, they're hiding
at the back.

1:00:21.307 --> 1:00:23.311
No one can see you unless you
walk right on top of them.

1:01:32.445 --> 1:01:34.081
What's going on?

1:01:35.414 --> 1:01:37.518
Police cut the power.

1:01:37.550 --> 1:01:39.119
It doesn't change anything.

1:01:41.922 --> 1:01:44.925
Eagan, is this the little shit
you've been looking for?

1:01:46.360 --> 1:01:48.329
Found him
hiding around the corner.

1:01:49.563 --> 1:01:51.499
You run away from me again

1:01:52.398 --> 1:01:55.335
and I will kill everyone.

1:02:02.576 --> 1:02:05.112
You run, boom!

1:02:06.914 --> 1:02:08.216
You got me?

1:02:09.583 --> 1:02:11.318
Don't let him out of your sight.

1:02:14.655 --> 1:02:15.957
Let's go.

1:02:16.422 --> 1:02:17.625
Now!

1:02:21.394 --> 1:02:23.163
Mikki, can you hear me?

1:02:25.264 --> 1:02:27.634
What's going on right now?

1:02:27.668 --> 1:02:29.871
<i>They're headed off
to the storerooms.</i>

1:02:36.076 --> 1:02:37.644
Move it.

1:02:37.677 --> 1:02:39.980
I'm helping you.

1:02:40.012 --> 1:02:43.049
Don't leave me in there
with everybody else. I just...

1:02:43.083 --> 1:02:45.052
Get inside.

1:03:00.300 --> 1:03:01.302
Boom.

1:03:03.336 --> 1:03:04.572
Sparks?

1:03:20.019 --> 1:03:21.387
Sparks?

1:03:21.420 --> 1:03:23.223
Man, what you doing?

1:03:24.523 --> 1:03:26.159
How did you get my gun?

1:03:29.195 --> 1:03:30.463
Long story.

1:03:31.130 --> 1:03:32.232
Shoot them.

1:03:33.400 --> 1:03:34.468
What?

1:03:35.601 --> 1:03:37.538
That bomb vest is bullshit.

1:03:39.338 --> 1:03:41.409
I've seen suicide bombers.

1:03:42.409 --> 1:03:43.644
He's lying.

1:03:45.378 --> 1:03:47.380
But what about
all the other explosives?

1:03:49.416 --> 1:03:52.553
Ones on the doors
look legit,

1:03:52.585 --> 1:03:54.554
but you're not gonna be
shooting the doors.

1:04:01.460 --> 1:04:03.563
Sparks, if the vest is fake,

1:04:05.231 --> 1:04:07.233
why are they doing all this?

1:04:09.068 --> 1:04:11.771
Your guess is as good as mine.

1:04:11.804 --> 1:04:15.275
Maybe they're only intending
on killing Sam...

1:04:17.344 --> 1:04:20.181
but you could take him out
before they hurt anybody else.

1:04:22.282 --> 1:04:25.419
The neck
or the back of the head.

1:04:27.286 --> 1:04:28.388
No.

1:04:28.822 --> 1:04:30.090
No.

1:04:30.123 --> 1:04:33.360
Once a Marine, always a Marine.

1:04:36.128 --> 1:04:38.665
Whatever happened to you
in Afghanistan,

1:04:39.199 --> 1:04:41.635
you're still a fighter

1:04:41.668 --> 1:04:43.503
and you still know how to shoot.

1:04:47.740 --> 1:04:50.710
- I'm not doing it.
- Look, look.

1:04:50.744 --> 1:04:53.547
Enough of your pussy
liberal shit, brother.

1:04:53.579 --> 1:04:57.150
The world is not safe.

1:05:00.387 --> 1:05:02.123
How many bullets you got left?

1:05:11.597 --> 1:05:13.099
Empty.

1:05:13.132 --> 1:05:14.567
One in the chamber.

1:05:16.436 --> 1:05:17.805
They sell ammo here?

1:05:19.371 --> 1:05:21.307
You know
you get a discount, right?

1:05:31.818 --> 1:05:33.721
You may not believe this

1:05:34.288 --> 1:05:36.190
but Sam does love you.

1:05:38.324 --> 1:05:39.592
Always has.

1:05:47.701 --> 1:05:49.369
<i>Kyle, we need you.</i>

1:05:52.838 --> 1:05:55.108
<i>Kyle, are you still there?</i>

1:05:55.141 --> 1:05:57.443
Sunny, wait.
What's going on?

1:05:57.476 --> 1:05:59.645
<i>They're headed off towards the storeroom.</i>

1:05:59.679 --> 1:06:01.648
Go. Go.

1:06:03.650 --> 1:06:05.820
Let's go, soldier. Go.

1:06:09.655 --> 1:06:10.791
Go, soldier.

1:06:24.304 --> 1:06:26.507
He got away. I'm getting by.

1:06:27.340 --> 1:06:28.509
What is this?

1:06:28.942 --> 1:06:30.344
Look at my leg.

1:06:33.179 --> 1:06:36.250
Bring me Sunshine or you die.

1:06:39.952 --> 1:06:41.889
Where the hell's Shane?

1:06:41.922 --> 1:06:44.157
He's either dead or he's hiding.

1:06:45.559 --> 1:06:46.794
Find him.

1:06:51.697 --> 1:06:53.433
Sunshine, it's me, Kyle.

1:07:01.273 --> 1:07:02.542
Are you okay?

1:07:04.811 --> 1:07:05.913
No.

1:07:10.282 --> 1:07:11.652
I'm sorry about Clove.

1:07:16.590 --> 1:07:17.725
It's okay.

1:07:23.630 --> 1:07:25.365
I gotta get us out of here.

1:07:27.701 --> 1:07:29.769
Where is everybody?

1:07:29.802 --> 1:07:32.205
Psycho locked them up
inside the storage room.

1:07:32.239 --> 1:07:34.507
He still has Nelson and Rainey
in Electronics.

1:07:34.541 --> 1:07:36.544
- And that boy you were with.
- Manny?

1:07:37.378 --> 1:07:39.380
- He's got Manny?
- Mmm-hmm.

1:07:48.420 --> 1:07:51.759
I know you're listening to me,
you sick son of a bitch.

1:08:28.595 --> 1:08:30.597
Yeah, I hear you, little piggy.

1:08:33.033 --> 1:08:35.703
And pretty soon,
I'm gonna blow this house down.

1:08:40.539 --> 1:08:42.042
Tell you what.

1:08:42.074 --> 1:08:44.043
You bring me Sunshine

1:08:44.077 --> 1:08:46.313
<i>and I'll give you
two of these three.</i>

1:08:47.780 --> 1:08:49.382
What do you say?

1:08:49.615 --> 1:08:50.717
Me?

1:08:52.719 --> 1:08:54.387
What does he want with me?

1:09:05.431 --> 1:09:07.268
He looks familiar to me.

1:09:08.967 --> 1:09:11.305
He's taking money.

1:09:11.337 --> 1:09:14.573
Means he has to get out of here
before the bombs go off, right?

1:09:14.606 --> 1:09:16.342
Okay, so what do we do?

1:09:17.944 --> 1:09:19.747
We tell him to go fuck himself.

1:09:23.048 --> 1:09:24.952
Listen to her. She's smart.

1:09:27.420 --> 1:09:29.722
I promised Clove
I'd save that little boy.

1:09:30.989 --> 1:09:32.592
I gave her my word.

1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:34.862
That's all I got.

1:09:35.427 --> 1:09:36.630
Kyle...

1:09:38.564 --> 1:09:40.033
Please get Rainey out.

1:09:41.067 --> 1:09:42.569
I'll handle it.

1:09:42.601 --> 1:09:44.371
I'll go get
all three of them out.

1:09:45.070 --> 1:09:46.573
Y'all get the rest.

1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:48.876
Let's do it

1:09:52.912 --> 1:09:54.414
Hey, brother.

1:09:56.483 --> 1:09:57.818
Go fuck yourself!

1:10:05.158 --> 1:10:07.861
You're pathetic. No one will even
remember your name in a month.

1:10:07.894 --> 1:10:09.930
Shut up. You're wrong.

1:10:09.962 --> 1:10:12.632
I'm making a statement here
that's gonna outlive us all.

1:10:13.699 --> 1:10:16.135
Oh, it's time
to say goodbye, Sam.

1:10:16.168 --> 1:10:17.805
No, wait, please!

1:10:18.070 --> 1:10:19.372
Boom!

1:10:21.140 --> 1:10:22.608
That's for Luther.

1:10:25.110 --> 1:10:27.713
No one is even gonna recognize
your corpse, Congressman.

1:10:27.747 --> 1:10:29.950
How's that for a legacy?

1:10:29.983 --> 1:10:32.386
After you're gone and
everyone thinks that I'm dead,

1:10:32.418 --> 1:10:34.387
I will be crawling
through a tunnel to freedom

1:10:34.421 --> 1:10:36.957
so that I can survive
and strike again.

1:10:36.989 --> 1:10:40.059
Because I am going to destroy
everything you love, Sam.

1:10:50.036 --> 1:10:52.639
Watch out.

1:10:57.810 --> 1:11:00.079
Shit...

1:11:00.113 --> 1:11:01.815
Come here. Get down.

1:11:03.449 --> 1:11:04.885
What do we do?

1:11:04.917 --> 1:11:07.420
- Find the hostages and get them out of here.
- Okay.

1:11:16.029 --> 1:11:17.631
Where are you gonna run to?

1:11:20.399 --> 1:11:23.170
Give me that, son.
Give me the gun. Come on.

1:11:24.703 --> 1:11:25.938
Let's go.

1:11:27.606 --> 1:11:29.009
- Sunny, can you hear? Where are you?
- Come on.

1:11:29.042 --> 1:11:31.611
<i>Rain, we're going
to the east exit.</i>

1:11:35.180 --> 1:11:38.050
Go ahead and shoot,
you'll all be charcoal anyway.

1:11:39.519 --> 1:11:41.855
I've had enough bad press
for the day.

1:11:41.887 --> 1:11:44.157
- Come on, let's get it.
- You can't just leave him!

1:11:44.189 --> 1:11:46.992
Yes, we can. Come on.

1:11:47.025 --> 1:11:49.962
Shit.
This isn't one of ours.

1:11:49.996 --> 1:11:53.800
Okay. Um, I need something
to cut this with. Like a...

1:11:53.832 --> 1:11:55.635
- I don't know.
- Here, here, here. How about this?

1:11:56.569 --> 1:11:57.871
Oh, okay.

1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:02.708
Hey, hey.
What is that? What is that?

1:12:04.077 --> 1:12:05.878
It is a bomb.

1:12:07.747 --> 1:12:09.016
Be careful.

1:12:10.682 --> 1:12:12.519
Okay. Come on, guys.
Let's go. Let's go!

1:12:12.551 --> 1:12:14.954
Everybody, out. Everybody, out.
Just keep going toward the door!

1:12:14.988 --> 1:12:17.758
Toward the...
Okay. Come on, let's go.

1:12:27.033 --> 1:12:28.202
Given up?

1:12:29.536 --> 1:12:30.737
Tired of running?

1:12:31.738 --> 1:12:33.006
You're out of bullets.

1:12:46.786 --> 1:12:48.121
You had it coming.

1:12:49.322 --> 1:12:50.690
I told you.

1:13:13.279 --> 1:13:15.582
- Sunny.
- Rain.

1:13:16.181 --> 1:13:17.951
Oh, my God.

1:13:21.154 --> 1:13:22.589
Shh.

1:13:24.157 --> 1:13:25.992
Are you guys okay?

1:13:26.024 --> 1:13:27.793
Yes, we're okay. Yes.

1:13:31.130 --> 1:13:32.298
Rainey?

1:13:35.335 --> 1:13:36.770
Where's Manny?

1:13:38.871 --> 1:13:40.172
He still has him.

1:13:42.708 --> 1:13:44.577
What are you doing?

1:13:45.244 --> 1:13:47.146
It's my job to protect him.

1:13:48.780 --> 1:13:50.250
You understand that, right?

1:13:52.085 --> 1:13:55.555
Go on, make your mother proud.
But do it fast, God damn it.

1:13:56.088 --> 1:13:57.823
Jesus. Now what?

1:13:57.856 --> 1:13:59.592
We need something
to pry the door open.

1:13:59.626 --> 1:14:03.195
Huh? Well, inside that door,
are all the tools in the world.

1:14:03.229 --> 1:14:04.731
Go get one.

1:14:11.003 --> 1:14:12.271
Manny?

1:14:21.079 --> 1:14:22.181
Manny?

1:14:40.733 --> 1:14:41.835
Manny?

1:14:45.438 --> 1:14:46.873
He's with Eagan.

1:14:51.810 --> 1:14:53.012
He's innocent.

1:14:53.046 --> 1:14:55.280
He's got nothing
to do with this.

1:14:55.314 --> 1:14:56.916
You're Sam's son.

1:14:56.948 --> 1:14:59.853
You brought him here.
That makes him a part of this.

1:14:59.886 --> 1:15:01.721
I know you don't like Sam.

1:15:01.753 --> 1:15:03.289
It was Luther that was guilty.

1:15:04.690 --> 1:15:05.791
Maybe.

1:15:06.993 --> 1:15:08.128
Maybe not.

1:15:08.161 --> 1:15:10.797
Uncle Luther did it.

1:15:10.829 --> 1:15:13.667
Sam put him up to it
and that makes him guilty.

1:15:15.134 --> 1:15:16.302
Uncle Luther?

1:15:18.037 --> 1:15:21.708
- That's your family?
- Yeah, Uncle Luther.

1:15:21.740 --> 1:15:24.711
Rotted away in prison
for 18 years.

1:15:24.743 --> 1:15:28.014
I had to raise myself,
Egan had to raise himself,

1:15:28.046 --> 1:15:29.982
and somebody's gotta pay.

1:15:31.751 --> 1:15:34.320
Right now that's you.

1:16:30.076 --> 1:16:32.746
- Get that door open!
- They're trying.

1:16:32.779 --> 1:16:34.748
Just shut up!
You're not in charge.

1:16:34.780 --> 1:16:37.818
She may not be in charge, but I am.

1:16:40.252 --> 1:16:42.088
You are so cool.

1:16:44.457 --> 1:16:48.328
So all the precision tools
in the world in this store

1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:50.730
and you pick a hammer.
Nice touch.

1:16:51.898 --> 1:16:54.100
<i>Sunshine, it's Raize.</i>

1:16:54.132 --> 1:16:57.737
- What?
- <i>The leader, it's Eagan Raize.</i>

1:17:00.907 --> 1:17:04.844
- Luther's son?
- Kyle, are you sure it's Eagan?

1:17:04.877 --> 1:17:06.513
<i>Clove thought she saw him
in the parking lot.</i>

1:17:06.546 --> 1:17:08.749
<i>Now one of his gunmen
confirmed it.</i>

1:17:44.182 --> 1:17:45.351
Stop it!

1:17:52.190 --> 1:17:54.927
Shall we try someone
with a brain now?

1:17:56.095 --> 1:17:57.530
Kyle, where are you?

1:17:58.997 --> 1:18:00.132
Kyle?

1:18:01.967 --> 1:18:08.907
R-A-I-Z-E.

1:18:08.940 --> 1:18:11.277
Narcissists always use their own names.

1:18:11.310 --> 1:18:14.147
We've got about ten minutes
until this place blows.

1:18:15.413 --> 1:18:16.916
I have to help him.

1:18:20.086 --> 1:18:21.320
You'll need this.

1:18:23.622 --> 1:18:24.957
Let's go.

1:18:35.134 --> 1:18:36.435
Where's the little boy?

1:18:37.136 --> 1:18:38.338
I don't know.

1:18:39.404 --> 1:18:40.573
Dead maybe?

1:18:41.640 --> 1:18:43.242
Like your cousin?

1:18:44.409 --> 1:18:45.878
You killed Terry?

1:18:46.979 --> 1:18:48.315
He had it coming.

1:18:50.416 --> 1:18:53.019
You know this place
is about to blow up, don't you?

1:18:54.020 --> 1:18:55.388
Tick-tock.

1:18:56.087 --> 1:18:57.189
What?

1:18:59.225 --> 1:19:00.493
Eagan, stop!

1:19:13.171 --> 1:19:15.074
You said you wanna see me?

1:19:15.640 --> 1:19:17.176
Here I am.

1:19:20.279 --> 1:19:21.481
Sunny...

1:19:22.981 --> 1:19:24.451
You look so beautiful.

1:19:25.618 --> 1:19:29.155
I know you're angry and afraid.

1:19:30.055 --> 1:19:33.025
I have a good escape plan.

1:19:33.059 --> 1:19:36.630
You don't need to do this.
Everyone got out. It's over.

1:19:37.662 --> 1:19:39.398
I want you to come with me.

1:19:41.434 --> 1:19:42.469
Okay.

1:19:43.168 --> 1:19:44.170
Okay.

1:19:48.474 --> 1:19:51.610
Just let me get Kyle out first.

1:19:51.644 --> 1:19:54.948
No, you're coming with me now.

1:19:58.751 --> 1:20:00.453
Go to hell.

1:20:17.502 --> 1:20:19.338
Don't come any closer!

1:20:26.345 --> 1:20:27.547
I earned this.

1:20:28.680 --> 1:20:30.582
Earn this, you piece of shit!

1:20:35.154 --> 1:20:38.091
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You okay?

1:20:38.123 --> 1:20:40.492
Are you okay? Rainey?

1:20:40.525 --> 1:20:42.394
Oh.

1:21:08.119 --> 1:21:09.221
Manny?

1:21:18.631 --> 1:21:20.300
Come here.

1:22:45.317 --> 1:22:48.121
Time to die, you little shit.

1:23:01.900 --> 1:23:03.368
It's over.

1:23:51.216 --> 1:23:52.618
Let's get out of here.

1:25:00.019 --> 1:25:03.322
<i>Authorities are saying the
evidence against Luther Raize</i>

1:25:03.354 --> 1:25:05.757
<i>is ironclad, indisputable,</i>

1:25:05.791 --> 1:25:08.994
<i>and Sam Nelson had
no wrongdoing in the matter.</i>

1:25:09.028 --> 1:25:11.797
This was not
an act of terrorism.

1:25:11.829 --> 1:25:13.832
I'm telling you,
the guy's a lunatic.

1:25:13.865 --> 1:25:17.703
I mean, the idea that he had
some great message is bullshit.

1:25:17.735 --> 1:25:20.872
I mean, look, the guy
just wanted to steal money

1:25:20.905 --> 1:25:22.774
from my business and he...

1:25:30.448 --> 1:25:32.018
Are you gonna say something?

1:25:33.351 --> 1:25:35.354
Yeah, Sam. I quit.

1:25:38.756 --> 1:25:42.461
This was full of money
ten minutes ago.

1:25:45.797 --> 1:25:47.699
I guess this means
we're unemployed.

1:25:48.033 --> 1:25:49.369
Yeah.

1:25:50.034 --> 1:25:51.770
No more Nelson's.

1:25:54.573 --> 1:25:57.643
So what if you opened up
your own practice?

1:25:57.676 --> 1:25:59.345
With what money?

1:25:59.377 --> 1:26:00.947
I've been doing a little saving.

1:26:03.748 --> 1:26:05.518
Mikki "Sticky Fingers."

1:26:05.551 --> 1:26:08.654
- You don't see me steal this.
- She has a point.

1:26:08.686 --> 1:26:10.055
You're putting that back, right?

1:26:10.722 --> 1:26:11.858
Maybe?

1:26:16.662 --> 1:26:18.530
All right.
Everything looks good.

1:26:18.564 --> 1:26:20.333
Vitals check out.
You're cleared.

1:26:21.533 --> 1:26:22.902
- Thank you.
- There he is.

1:26:25.069 --> 1:26:26.505
Baby.

1:26:29.108 --> 1:26:30.710
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1:26:32.110 --> 1:26:33.746
Did you save them, Daddy?

1:26:35.780 --> 1:26:37.949
I gave you and Clove
my word I would.

1:26:37.983 --> 1:26:40.119
I did the best I could.

1:26:40.152 --> 1:26:42.454
Looks like maybe
you've found your purpose.

1:26:44.422 --> 1:26:46.458
I guess I just made it up
along the way.

1:26:49.027 --> 1:26:52.364
You know,
you should come by sometime.

1:26:52.398 --> 1:26:55.668
Maybe me and Angel can put a little
something on the grill for you.

1:26:55.701 --> 1:26:58.770
- What do you say, Grandpa?
- I'll bring the steaks.

1:27:03.675 --> 1:27:06.378
Angel. Come here, come here.

1:27:06.412 --> 1:27:08.713
I want you to say hi to Manny.

1:27:08.747 --> 1:27:10.983
Manny, this is Angel.
Angel, this is Manny.

1:27:11.350 --> 1:27:12.652
Hi, Manny.

1:27:13.952 --> 1:27:15.954
Manny helped save
your dad's life.

1:27:17.488 --> 1:27:19.658
I owe this little man
everything.

1:27:21.592 --> 1:27:24.529
His father has been lost
and, um,

1:27:24.563 --> 1:27:27.600
I'm gonna go to the courts and see if
they'll let him stay with us for a while.

1:27:27.632 --> 1:27:29.101
Would you be okay with that?

1:27:37.810 --> 1:27:38.945
We're good.

1:27:41.012 --> 1:27:42.014
Okay.

1:27:42.047 --> 1:27:45.451
See, I told you
private school would pay off.

1:27:50.855 --> 1:27:53.458
Somebody's gotta
teach me Spanish soon.
