00:03.000 --> 00:04.834
(Ryan)
Previously, on Mech-X4...

00:04.917 --> 00:08.667
You are a technopath, who can
control machines with your mind.

00:08.750 --> 00:11.625
The monsters are sent
by people, terrible people.

00:11.709 --> 00:13.917
That's why I built Mech-X4.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.709
So you could stop them, Ryan.

00:15.792 --> 00:17.709
-(Spyder) Perfect fit.
-(Harris) Exact handwriting.

00:17.792 --> 00:20.834
(Ryan) This Leo guy, he knew
I had powers when I was a baby,

00:20.917 --> 00:23.291
and built this robot for me.

00:23.375 --> 00:25.458
-...rude young man!
-(thuds)

00:26.709 --> 00:27.750
Ah-ah-ah.

00:27.834 --> 00:30.417
We need answers.
We need to figure out who this guy is,

00:30.500 --> 00:32.792
and how and why
I got my powers.

00:34.792 --> 00:36.500
-What did you do?
-It wasn't me.

00:36.583 --> 00:38.792
-Well, it wasn't me and it's usually me.
-(alarm blaring)

00:39.417 --> 00:40.625
Oh, boy. Oh!

00:43.750 --> 00:45.000
Ah!

00:46.291 --> 00:48.125
Guys? We're pinned down
by drones.

00:48.208 --> 00:50.000
We could use
a little help over here.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.959
We're a little busy
ourselves, dude.

00:52.041 --> 00:55.166
Hang on! Here they come.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.333
Batter up!

00:58.417 --> 01:00.542
-That thing isn't going anywhere.
-(Mark) Yeah, it is.

01:07.166 --> 01:08.709
(grunts)

01:08.792 --> 01:09.834
You've left me no choice.

01:09.917 --> 01:13.250
The robot is going to self-destruct!

01:15.834 --> 01:17.625
(theme music playing)

01:34.959 --> 01:37.834
-(seagulls crying)
-(buoy bell clanging)

01:41.834 --> 01:44.250
Awesome, bro.
You're getting really good at that.

01:44.333 --> 01:45.417
At flipping?

01:45.500 --> 01:47.625
Yeah. You nailed it.

01:47.709 --> 01:48.875
World class, Ry-Guy.

01:49.750 --> 01:51.542
Uh, thanks.
(laughs)

01:51.625 --> 01:53.750
Do you need anything?
Uh... frozen yogurt?

01:53.834 --> 01:54.875
Nah.

01:54.959 --> 01:55.959
Fruit smoothie?

01:56.041 --> 01:57.125
Nope.

01:57.208 --> 01:58.667
Can I get you anything?

01:58.750 --> 02:00.875
-Some space? (laughs)
-Yeah.

02:03.125 --> 02:05.166
Okay, I'm gonna go down

02:05.250 --> 02:08.041
and see if Harris has anything
with that note that Mom gave me.

02:08.125 --> 02:09.375
Got you.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.291
Watch your step.

02:12.375 --> 02:13.834
-Sure.
-Got you.

02:13.917 --> 02:16.000
-I got this.
-I know.

02:16.083 --> 02:18.333
Then let go
of my hand, weirdo.

02:18.417 --> 02:20.709
There you go.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.709
Just watch your step.

02:25.041 --> 02:26.834
-You good?
-Yeah.

02:28.375 --> 02:32.208
Explain to me again why you tried to do
a double somersault off my lab bench?

02:32.291 --> 02:34.166
Because I was dared to.

02:34.250 --> 02:36.417
By me. I don't take that
from anybody.

02:36.500 --> 02:37.583
Aah.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.208
I don't have time
for this, Spyder.

02:39.291 --> 02:41.834
I'm analyzing the fingerprint
on Ryan's note.

02:41.917 --> 02:44.333
And I need to come up
with a project for the first round

02:44.417 --> 02:46.333
of the Harper Grant.
(sighs)

02:46.417 --> 02:49.250
Hey, look, I keep telling you:
invent self-repairing underwear.

02:49.333 --> 02:53.291
No. I'm already doing a study
on arthropod and mollusk hemocyanin.

02:53.375 --> 02:55.041
(snores, gasps)

02:56.125 --> 02:58.166
Seth Harper's gonna hate that.

02:58.250 --> 03:00.917
I once saw him wrestle a feral pig
on some wildlife show.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.750
That doesn't sound remotely true.

03:02.834 --> 03:06.000
The point is...
he's a maverick, an adventurer.

03:06.083 --> 03:08.500
-Like me.
-Like you?

03:08.583 --> 03:10.834
Yes, okay? If you want
to impress Seth Harper,

03:10.917 --> 03:12.500
you have to do something daring.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.417
Get in touch with your inner Spyder.

03:14.500 --> 03:18.125
Ignore that nerdy voice in your head
telling you to follow the rules.

03:18.208 --> 03:20.959
I love that voice.
It sounds like Morgan Freeman.

03:21.041 --> 03:22.667
Dude, trust me.

03:22.750 --> 03:25.792
The effects of an illogical thought
process on a logical mind.

03:25.875 --> 03:28.041
Hmm. Interesting.

03:29.750 --> 03:33.208
Have any of you been noticing
that Mark's been acting strange?

03:33.291 --> 03:35.875
Well, he didn't know my name
this morning, so no.

03:35.959 --> 03:38.250
And, Harris, I really hope
you analyzed the note

03:38.333 --> 03:40.291
before you started
playing doctor with Spyder.

03:40.375 --> 03:42.125
I'm already searching
all police

03:42.208 --> 03:44.333
and government databases
for the print we found.

03:47.667 --> 03:49.542
(whirring, beeping)

03:49.625 --> 03:52.667
(gasps)
Bam, y'all, we got a match!

03:54.792 --> 03:56.959
And the lucky winner is...

04:14.542 --> 04:16.125
(grunts)

04:16.208 --> 04:17.917
(Mastermind) (through computer)
I had them.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.041
Your robot and your pilots,
I had them in my grasp.

04:22.792 --> 04:24.166
Let me guess,
you lost them both.

04:24.250 --> 04:25.792
How's that make you feel?

04:25.875 --> 04:29.333
Hm. Feels like lunch is over.

04:29.417 --> 04:32.917
The only reason you're alive
is you have information I need,

04:33.000 --> 04:36.792
and... out of respect for our past.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.041
(laughs)

04:39.125 --> 04:41.291
You really are a softy,
anyone ever tell you that?

04:41.375 --> 04:42.917
Due to recent losses,
I've had to take

04:43.000 --> 04:45.834
a more hands-on role
in my mission.

04:45.917 --> 04:49.417
You're the only one now who can tell me
who the pilots are.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.709
I will break you, Leo.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.792
I will figure out a way
to make you talk.

04:58.083 --> 04:59.917
(panting)

05:01.041 --> 05:02.667
(grunts)

05:02.750 --> 05:04.667
See you at dinner!

05:05.917 --> 05:07.208
(Harris)
That's our guy.

05:07.291 --> 05:09.709
Leo Mendel. Finally a name.

05:09.792 --> 05:12.125
(Harris) Looks like the police
have a pretty thick file on him.

05:12.208 --> 05:16.375
He's suspected of stealing large pieces of
technology from several companies.

05:16.458 --> 05:18.667
And he probably took 'em here.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.166
Look! His last known address.

05:20.250 --> 05:23.750
(Harris) Ry, remember the chances
of Leo being there are pretty slim.

05:23.834 --> 05:25.917
-He said he could be dead.
-I know. I know!

05:26.000 --> 05:29.709
But if we follow the clues,
who knows what we'll find.

05:47.875 --> 05:49.583
(Spyder)
Oh, sweet!

05:49.667 --> 05:50.667
An empty lot.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.917
Okay, dibs on anything
pointy or rusty.

06:01.792 --> 06:03.792
Ah, there you go, buddy!

06:03.875 --> 06:05.333
-(Ryan laughs)
-Careful, now.

06:06.709 --> 06:07.875
(Ryan)
Geez.

06:09.875 --> 06:10.959
(sighs)

06:11.041 --> 06:13.583
(Spyder) Something's not right
about this place.

06:13.667 --> 06:16.625
That squirrel has run
back and forth four times now.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.750
Yeah, he's right.

06:18.834 --> 06:21.458
There's something off
about his place, I can feel it.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.959
It's a hologram.

06:51.125 --> 06:53.917
(Harris)
Whoa. What is this place?

07:21.458 --> 07:23.625
Whoa.

07:23.709 --> 07:27.041
This looks an earlier model
of Mech-X4.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.417
Only one way to find out.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.709
-Actually, there's many ways to find out.
-Dude, wait.

07:33.792 --> 07:35.709
You don't know
what's in there.

07:35.792 --> 07:37.667
Mark's right.
This could be dangerous.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.834
But your inner Spyder says...?

07:41.500 --> 07:45.000
Go big or go home! Whoo!

07:45.083 --> 07:46.083
What?

07:48.959 --> 07:50.500
Inner Spyder?

07:50.583 --> 07:52.333
We do stuff.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.500
(beeps)

08:30.709 --> 08:31.917
Okay, it's safe.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.667
What is wrong with you?

08:34.750 --> 08:37.750
Nothing.
I'm your big brother.

08:37.834 --> 08:39.709
-This is what big brothers do.
-Since when?

08:41.709 --> 08:44.500
Weird. There's no path
for a technopath.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.709
(Ryan) I wonder how
you control it?

08:47.709 --> 08:48.667
-Nice.
-There we go.

08:48.750 --> 08:49.750
All right.

08:50.750 --> 08:52.041
-Hi, there!
-(screams)

08:52.125 --> 08:53.792
Welcome to Mech-X3!

08:53.875 --> 08:56.291
-Leo?
-Please hold still while I...

08:56.375 --> 08:57.834
elim... eliminate you!

08:57.917 --> 09:00.125
(drones buzzing)

09:00.208 --> 09:01.667
-Hold on.
-(gasps)

09:02.750 --> 09:05.000
(drones buzzing)

09:08.792 --> 09:10.500
Wait, wait, wait!

09:10.583 --> 09:11.542
We can explain.

09:11.625 --> 09:12.834
We came here to find you.

09:12.917 --> 09:14.500
You're not authorized
to be... be here.

09:14.583 --> 09:16.542
I'm Ryan Walker.

09:16.625 --> 09:18.083
You're not authorized
to be... be here!

09:18.166 --> 09:20.583
Wait, Leo, it's me!
The technopath.

09:21.959 --> 09:24.166
(drone buzzing)

09:29.000 --> 09:31.458
My drone indicates
you're telling the truth.

09:31.542 --> 09:33.875
Plus, you know
the word technopath.

09:33.959 --> 09:35.792
That's totally a word Leo invented.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.667
You're not Leo, are you?

09:37.750 --> 09:43.375
I'm Leo-OS, the artificial intelligence
operating system for Mech-X3.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.959
-And?
-Oh, right, sorry.

09:46.041 --> 09:51.041
Technopathy was very important to
my creator, so I will not terminate you.

09:51.125 --> 09:52.291
Yay!

09:52.375 --> 09:53.417
For now.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.792
Yay?

09:54.875 --> 09:56.125
Come on. Go, shoo, scat.

09:58.709 --> 10:00.417
When is the last time
you saw Leo?

10:00.500 --> 10:03.000
It's been two years,
four days and 17 minutes. Wait!

10:03.083 --> 10:06.667
(ticking) Eighteen, just now,
just turned 18.

10:06.750 --> 10:11.333
Boy. That's way after
Leo made the video.

10:11.417 --> 10:15.000
He... He could be alive.

10:16.166 --> 10:18.959
(panting)

10:24.917 --> 10:27.083
(groans softly)

10:27.166 --> 10:28.959
Spork.

10:29.041 --> 10:30.667
(whirring)

10:36.875 --> 10:38.625
(screams)

10:40.333 --> 10:43.750
Spork. Spork makes spark.

10:47.959 --> 10:49.000
(grunts)

10:54.375 --> 10:55.709
(beeps)

10:55.792 --> 10:57.083
(hydraulic whir)

11:11.000 --> 11:13.542
(Leo-OS) It's just so strange
to have visitors in my head.

11:13.625 --> 11:15.333
It's also strange
to say that out loud.

11:15.417 --> 11:18.166
So you have no records
for a Ryan Walker.

11:18.250 --> 11:21.417
I have one reference
for a Bryan McWalker.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.291
Champion bagpipe player?

11:23.375 --> 11:24.417
Correct.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.667
(bagpipe music playing)

11:25.750 --> 11:27.250
-Oh, dude, whoa!
-Please stop.

11:28.500 --> 11:33.250
Mm. Yes. Yes.
Oh, yes, Bryan McWalker.

11:33.333 --> 11:36.041
He was never fully
respected for his talents.

11:36.125 --> 11:37.166
True dat.

11:37.250 --> 11:38.750
So what happened to you?

11:38.834 --> 11:41.542
I'm a... failed experiment.

11:41.625 --> 11:46.458
This is what... what happens I guess
when a robot doesn't have a technopath.

11:47.375 --> 11:49.542
Well, tell me everything.
Where to technopaths come from?

11:49.625 --> 11:52.208
Am I the only one?
What else don't I know...

11:52.291 --> 11:53.959
All files are classified
as per Leo's orders.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.792
But it would really help me out
if you could just tell me...

11:57.875 --> 12:00.792
All files are... are class...
Classified as per Leo's orders!

12:00.875 --> 12:02.500
Shutting down.

12:02.583 --> 12:03.542
Oh!

12:03.625 --> 12:05.166
Hey, not cool, fake Leo.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.417
What?

12:07.750 --> 12:10.709
Hey, you know,
if this robot's like ours,

12:10.792 --> 12:11.750
it was a data core.

12:11.834 --> 12:13.917
You know, if we override
the shutdown,

12:14.000 --> 12:17.083
I can technopathically
shuffle the data onto our phones.

12:17.166 --> 12:18.875
Harris, do you think
you can turn on the power

12:18.959 --> 12:20.834
and then re-route it
so the AI can't turn it off?

12:20.917 --> 12:22.208
Sure, I can do that.

12:22.291 --> 12:23.166
And I got your back.

12:23.250 --> 12:26.291
We should head to the data core
while these two turn on the power.

12:26.375 --> 12:29.750
Sneaking around a crumbling robot
that was just trying to kill us?

12:29.834 --> 12:31.000
Inner Spyder says...?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.208
-Let's do it!
-I'm so proud!

12:34.375 --> 12:36.250
-Watch it.
-Come on, let's go!

12:37.166 --> 12:38.834
Ah! Piece of cake.

12:38.917 --> 12:40.709
Oh, no. Okay,
not a piece of cake.

12:40.792 --> 12:43.375
You almost killed yourself when you
jumped over that piece of scrap.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.875
(snores)

12:44.959 --> 12:47.959
Oh my gosh. I'm becoming you?

12:48.041 --> 12:50.583
-Huh.
-I'm embracing my inner Harris.

12:50.667 --> 12:53.041
Possibly side effect
of me having an inner Spyder.

12:53.125 --> 12:58.417
Oh. Embracing my inner Spyder
makes me feel... alive!

12:58.500 --> 13:01.917
Embracing my inner Harris
makes me feel... 40?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.667
(beeps)

13:03.750 --> 13:06.333
-Aw.
-Nice.

13:06.417 --> 13:09.834
(buzzing and whirring)

13:12.333 --> 13:14.000
Whoa.

13:18.917 --> 13:21.208
This place looks like
it has a million records here.

13:21.291 --> 13:23.709
Just... download it all
and let's get you out of here.

13:31.875 --> 13:33.875
(beeping)

13:33.959 --> 13:35.083
It's working.

13:35.166 --> 13:37.291
(alarm blaring)

13:37.375 --> 13:40.542
Not fast enough.
Come on, dude.

13:40.625 --> 13:43.000
You're attempting
to steal classified data.

13:43.083 --> 13:46.166
Dang it. Now I don't
have anyone to talk to anymore.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.542
Wait. Why?

13:47.625 --> 13:50.583
Well, I kind of sort of
have to make you dead.

13:50.667 --> 13:53.834
Dead's gonna be a bummer.
Drones!

13:56.125 --> 13:57.291
What?

13:58.333 --> 13:59.834
(drones buzzing)

13:59.917 --> 14:01.333
Oh, my gosh. Go, go, go!

14:08.667 --> 14:10.291
-What did you do?
-It wasn't me.

14:10.375 --> 14:11.709
Well, it wasn't me
and it's usually me.

14:12.709 --> 14:14.083
Oh, boy. Go!

14:16.709 --> 14:17.709
(groans)

14:19.750 --> 14:23.667
Guys? We're pinned down by drones.
We could use a little help over here.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.834
We're a little busy ourselves, dude.

14:25.917 --> 14:29.000
Hang on.
Here they come.

14:29.083 --> 14:30.667
(buzzing)

14:30.750 --> 14:32.000
Batter up!

14:32.083 --> 14:33.625
(Ryan) That thing isn't
going anywhere.

14:33.709 --> 14:34.667
(Mark)
Yeah, it is.

14:37.625 --> 14:41.333
(laughs) Whoo!
He got all of that one!

14:41.417 --> 14:43.291
Okay, Mark, I need you to go
down to the equipment room

14:43.375 --> 14:44.667
and help out Harris and Spyder.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.291
No way, dude.
I'm not leaving you.

14:46.375 --> 14:47.375
(buzzing)

14:48.959 --> 14:51.000
I'm not leaving
until I have what I need!

14:51.083 --> 14:54.792
H... Hey! Those files
are for Leo's eyes only!

14:54.875 --> 14:57.125
But I'm on Leo's side!

14:57.208 --> 14:58.709
(buzzing)

15:02.875 --> 15:04.709
We should've never
come down here.

15:04.792 --> 15:05.792
I hate my inner Spyder.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.083
I'm going back
to my inner Harris.

15:08.166 --> 15:13.291
I'm a beautiful boy, who thinks,
likes to make plans.

15:13.375 --> 15:15.583
Spyder and Harris
are pinned down right now.

15:15.667 --> 15:17.667
I need you to go down there
and clear a path for them.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.250
Trust me, I'll be right behind you.

15:19.333 --> 15:20.750
No way, man,
I'm not leaving you.

15:20.834 --> 15:22.000
Brothers don't do that.

15:22.083 --> 15:23.959
You did that all the time before.

15:24.041 --> 15:25.291
That was before.

15:27.709 --> 15:30.500
Before... before you learned
I was adopted.

15:30.583 --> 15:31.917
Ow! You little dingus!

15:32.000 --> 15:33.083
Ow! Finally!

15:33.166 --> 15:36.000
-Uh, I'm so sorry, dude.
-No, don't be.

15:36.083 --> 15:38.333
Be the swaggering buttknuckle
I grew up with.

15:38.417 --> 15:40.041
I need him to help us right now.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.166
Nothing's changed.
I'm me and you're you.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.500
Get out of my body!

15:46.041 --> 15:48.959
Hey. Let's go save your loser friends.

15:55.083 --> 15:56.875
(whirring)

16:15.291 --> 16:16.625
-Whoo!
-Whoa, Mark, that was awesome!

16:16.709 --> 16:18.834
Come on, dingus... uh, dinguses.

16:18.917 --> 16:20.667
Harris, which one is it,
is it dingusi?

16:20.750 --> 16:21.583
Dingi!

16:21.667 --> 16:23.125
-Okay, come on.
-Let's just go!

16:27.166 --> 16:29.709
-(alarm blaring)
-(Leo-OS) Lockdown activated!

16:30.709 --> 16:32.500
Oh, man, now what?

16:32.583 --> 16:34.250
Oh!

16:36.583 --> 16:38.333
Whoa! Whoa!

16:39.208 --> 16:40.458
Really?

16:40.542 --> 16:42.667
(alarm continuing)

16:42.750 --> 16:46.208
The probability of you defeating
my drones continues to increase.

16:46.291 --> 16:48.917
The robot is going
to self-destruct!

16:49.000 --> 16:50.333
You've left me no choice.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.291
I can think of a lot of choices.

16:53.375 --> 16:55.291
Hmm. Let us go!

16:58.041 --> 16:59.542
Don't blow us up.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.417
Open the doors!

17:06.709 --> 17:08.750
-(grunting)
-Come on!

17:08.834 --> 17:10.375
-Let's go.
-Guys!

17:10.458 --> 17:12.792
-(buzzing)
-Guys, guys!

17:17.458 --> 17:18.583
(grunts)

17:18.667 --> 17:19.834
Go, go, go!

17:23.792 --> 17:25.750
Leo would not want you
to blow me up.

17:25.834 --> 17:28.041
What do you know
about what Leo wants?

17:28.125 --> 17:29.959
I know that Leo needs me.

17:30.041 --> 17:33.750
He built a robot specifically
for me to fight monsters.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.625
Same reason he built you, right?

17:36.834 --> 17:38.834
That means
we're in this together.

17:40.625 --> 17:42.583
We have the same purpose.

17:44.333 --> 17:45.959
We're kind of like brothers.

17:47.542 --> 17:49.083
(grunts)

17:49.166 --> 17:50.875
(beeping)

17:53.542 --> 17:54.709
Drones.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.875
(Mark)
It's okay, it's okay.

17:57.959 --> 17:59.667
Come on.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.750
You can think for yourself.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.041
If you blow us up, the bad guys win.

18:07.125 --> 18:10.750
You fail your mission. You fail Leo.
Is that what you want?

18:13.542 --> 18:15.000
It's not what he would want.

18:15.083 --> 18:17.166
Push it, push it.

18:17.250 --> 18:18.291
Come on!

18:19.583 --> 18:22.667
(power hums, stops)

18:25.000 --> 18:26.709
(beeping, whirring)

18:31.083 --> 18:32.625
Go, go, go!

18:37.875 --> 18:39.709
I miss him.

18:40.583 --> 18:43.333
I want to believe that Leo
is still out there.

18:43.417 --> 18:46.750
Is there anything in these files
that'll help me find him?

18:46.834 --> 18:52.041
No. But Leo implanted
a receiver chip in his brain

18:52.125 --> 18:54.834
to download his psychological
profile into me.

18:54.917 --> 18:56.959
I can send a pulse out
that will tell me where he is.

18:57.041 --> 18:59.208
So long as he's not dead
or out of range.

18:59.291 --> 19:00.709
That's great!

19:00.792 --> 19:03.542
Never tried it before because, well...

19:03.625 --> 19:07.125
to send out this pulse I'll have to
exhaust all my power and resources.

19:08.125 --> 19:10.208
(sighs)
What'll happen to you?

19:10.291 --> 19:12.083
I heard you and your brother
talk before.

19:12.166 --> 19:16.625
This is the kind of thing brothers do
for each other, right?

19:16.709 --> 19:18.417
Knuttbuckle. Heh.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.208
It's actually buttnuckle, but...

19:20.291 --> 19:21.417
Buttnuckle, is it?

19:21.500 --> 19:23.542
Wait, just give me
another chance to find...

19:23.625 --> 19:27.083
Please. Just tell Leo I said...

19:28.291 --> 19:29.709
Hey.

19:31.041 --> 19:32.417
(power hums, stops)

19:42.500 --> 19:44.542
(beeps)

19:53.583 --> 19:55.792
Come on, Leo. Don't be dead.
Don't... Please don't be dead.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.500
Come on, Leo.

20:00.834 --> 20:02.583
Oh, no.

20:07.959 --> 20:09.834
(beeping)

20:15.709 --> 20:17.583
I'll find him.

20:17.667 --> 20:19.250
I promise.

20:45.041 --> 20:48.083
(Mastermind) And now you know
there's no possibility of escape,

20:48.166 --> 20:51.041
and no one can find you here.

20:51.125 --> 20:54.333
You can tell me who the pilots are,
or you can rot here.

20:55.375 --> 20:56.500
Forever.

20:56.583 --> 20:57.917
(screams)

21:05.291 --> 21:06.500
Check it.

21:07.542 --> 21:10.625
"Finding Your Inner Spyder:
A first-person account of

21:10.709 --> 21:13.917
trying to figure out why people
make such terrible decisions."

21:14.000 --> 21:15.625
You're way more interesting
than a mollusk.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.458
That's not really
a compliment.

21:17.542 --> 21:19.375
Huh. Phone, please.

21:22.875 --> 21:24.750
Okay, I mapped the coordinates

21:24.834 --> 21:27.834
based on the data
we got from Leo-OS, and...

21:28.834 --> 21:30.166
He's at the bottom
of the ocean.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.125
So that could be a problem.

21:34.166 --> 21:35.834
(theme music playing)

21:58.834 --> 22:00.250
(barking)
