MRS. FORMAN.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.806
SHUT UP! YOU ARE LUCKY
TO EVEN LIVE HERE.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.767
YOU'RE AN ORPHAN.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.977
SHE CALLED ME AN ORPHAN.

03:49.145 --> 03:51.230
HEY, HE'S NOT AN ORPHAN.
HIS MOM JUST ABANDONED HIM.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.357
SHUT UP,
FORMAN!

03:53.524 --> 03:54.608

IT'S HORRIBLE.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.678
I CAN'T BE SEEN IN THIS.
IT'S LIKE...

05:46.846 --> 05:50.766
UGH! IT'S LIKE HAVING A STY.

05:50.933 --> 05:54.936
UH-OH, THIS VAN
WILL NOT BE ROCKING.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.564
OH, SURE IS SOMETHING.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.400
23 YEARS OF WORKING HERE,
AND NOW IT'S ALL GONE.

06:00.568 --> 06:01.985
OF COURSE YOU'RE
GONNA FIND WORK.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.488
YOU'RE A SUPERVISOR.

06:04.655 --> 06:08.533
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
EXCUSE ME.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.243

08:35.848 --> 08:40.227
I MEAN, I KNOW WE'VE MADE
OUT A COUPLE DOZEN TIMES.

08:40.394 --> 08:41.811

09:06.671 --> 09:08.880
I THINK YOU LIKE ME
SITTING ON YOU.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.551
IN FACT,
I KNOW YOU DO.

09:12.718 --> 09:18.056
OKAY, HA HA, BUT THAT'S
NOT THE POINT. HEH HEH.

09:18.224 --> 09:22.477

09:57.888 --> 09:59.514
KELSO?

09:59.682 --> 10:04.853
OH, MAN...
I MEAN, NOTHING.

10:06.188 --> 10:11.985
SO, ERIC, ISN'T
YOUR SISTER HOT?

10:12.361 --> 10:13.737
NO.

10:13.904 --> 10:15.572
IN FACT, KELSO, I THINK
YOU'RE THE ONLY LOSER HERE

10:15.740 --> 10:18.283
WHO THINKS SHE IS HOT.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.619
NOT TRUE.

10:20.786 --> 10:24.080
I HAVE PICTURED HER NAKED
HUNDREDS OF TIMES.

10:24.248 --> 10:27.334
WHY, JUST THIS MORNING
I WAS TAKING A SHOWER...

10:27.501 --> 10:29.461
COME ON, FEZ, MAN,

10:29.629 --> 10:32.922
IT IS ABSOLUTELY INAPPROPRIATE
AND DISRESPECTFUL

10:33.090 --> 10:36.259
TO TALK ABOUT HOW HOT
SOMEBODY ELSE'S SISTER IS.

10:36.427 --> 10:39.471
NO MATTER HOW BAD YOU
WANT TO GIVE IT TO HER.

10:39.639 --> 10:43.099
RIGHT, KELSO?

10:43.267 --> 10:44.392
OH, MAN.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.604
OH, MAN. I...

10:47.772 --> 10:49.606
WHAT IS IT, BOY?

10:49.774 --> 10:51.524
IS IT TROUBLE?

10:51.692 --> 10:55.278
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO
TELL US ABOUT ERIC'S SISTER?

10:55.446 --> 10:58.448
I TOTALLY DID IT
WITH HER!

10:58.616 --> 11:00.575
I'M SORRY, MAN.

11:00.743 --> 11:04.162
WHAT?!

11:04.330 --> 11:05.997
I... I MEAN,
SHE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.917
I'M... I'M VIOLATED.

11:09.085 --> 11:13.046
YOU IDIOT,
YOUR THUMBS ARE STILL UP.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.548
HEH HEH.
ACTING'S HARD.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.425
HEY, SHUT UP, PERV.

11:17.593 --> 11:20.387
THAT'S MY SISTER.
COME ON!

11:20.554 --> 11:22.514
I KNOW.

11:22.682 --> 11:27.519
IT IS FORBIDDEN,
TABOO, TITILLATING.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.771
ISN'T IT IRONIC THAT
TITILLATING HAS

11:29.939 --> 11:32.816
THE WORD "TIT" IN IT?

11:32.983 --> 11:35.443
OH, MAN,
THAT REMINDS ME.

11:35.611 --> 11:38.071
OH, SHUT UP!

11:38.239 --> 11:39.322
LOOK, I SWEAR TO GOD,

11:39.490 --> 11:41.199
YOU SAY ONE MORE WORD
ABOUT MY SISTER,

11:41.367 --> 11:44.452
AND I'M GONNA
TELL JACKIE.
