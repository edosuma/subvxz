37:14.232 --> 37:17.724
Scottie. Aren't you the challenging
woman to pin down?

37:20.530 --> 37:23.112
The FBI just received a call
from Airports Authority.

37:23.283 --> 37:26.901
Mr. Reddington escaped police custody
from a first class lounge at BWI.

37:27.078 --> 37:30.115
Can't be right. Tom called him
and warned him it was a setup.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.952
All I know is one officer's missing,
one's injured...

37:33.126 --> 37:35.242
...and I cannot reach Mr. Reddington.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.957
Get over there
and find out what happened.

37:38.548 --> 37:40.789
SCOTTIE:
I have to give you this, Raymond.

37:40.967 --> 37:44.551
It's been years since a man
worked this hard to gain my attention.

37:44.721 --> 37:48.179
Who hired you to go after
Elizabeth Keen?

37:49.058 --> 37:52.141
Howard would be so happy to see you.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.144
He still tells that story
at dinner parties...

37:55.315 --> 37:57.647
...about the night you were jumped
in Kuala Lumpur.

37:57.817 --> 38:00.650
Each time, there are five more machetes
you had to fight off.

38:00.820 --> 38:03.277
My fondness for your husband
holds no currency here.

38:04.699 --> 38:07.907
I didn't kill Masha-- Elizabeth Keen.
Whatever you wanna call her.

38:08.077 --> 38:09.692
She died in childbirth.

38:09.871 --> 38:12.032
Perhaps if she'd been
in a proper hospital....

38:12.749 --> 38:14.285
Aah. Damn you.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.457
[SCOTTIE GROANS]

38:17.670 --> 38:21.333
I couldn't foresee what happened
to that poor girl any more than you.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.801
I told you I was hired...

38:23.968 --> 38:26.755
...to abduct her, not take her life.

38:27.430 --> 38:30.467
-Who hired you?
-You know exactly who hired me.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.054
I'd like to be sure.

38:33.603 --> 38:35.719
Alexander Kirk.

38:35.939 --> 38:37.600
[m1

38:40.527 --> 38:44.019
I talked to the guard. He says his partner
jumped him from behind.

38:44.197 --> 38:45.403
Why, to help Reddington?

38:45.573 --> 38:48.064
More than likely, the guard
was in on the abduction...

38:48.243 --> 38:51.076
...which Reddington walked into
despite knowing it was a trap.

38:51.246 --> 38:55.455
I'm looking at a report that says
the containers never made it to evidence.

38:55.625 --> 38:57.661
The entire convoy
was hijacked this morning.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.202
-You think Reddington took it?
-| get the feeling...

39:00.380 --> 39:03.122
...he has an agenda here
he's not sharing with us.

39:03.299 --> 39:07.918
You know, I used to have such
high hopes for your organization.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.802
High hopes for Howard.

39:10.723 --> 39:14.762
Halcyon was once
such a promising company...

39:14.936 --> 39:16.722
...Iike AOL.

39:16.896 --> 39:20.764
Put an entire generation online.

39:21.317 --> 39:23.854
Companies can so easily
lose their way.

39:24.028 --> 39:27.862
Forget what it was that made them
great to begin with.

39:28.032 --> 39:32.401
I remember a time when your husband
never would have taken a job...

39:32.579 --> 39:34.490
...from a man like Alexander Kirk...

39:34.664 --> 39:38.577
-...if only out of respect for his friends.
-Howard didn't take that job.

39:38.751 --> 39:41.914
We haven't had sex in four years.
We're rarely in the same country...

39:42.088 --> 39:44.921
-...Iet alone the same bed.
-What bed have you been occupying?

39:45.091 --> 39:47.673
I've been assuming a larger role
in management position.

39:47.844 --> 39:51.007
-You don't say.
-We've never been more successful.

39:52.932 --> 39:55.969
Listen, Red.

39:56.853 --> 39:59.219
I regret what happened
to Elizabeth Keen.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.264
But her kidnapping was simply
a business decision.

40:02.442 --> 40:03.978
You should recognize that.

40:04.152 --> 40:06.689
We all do what we have to
in order to survive.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.148
You know, Howard and I do.

40:08.323 --> 40:10.439
Survival is all relative.

40:10.617 --> 40:12.107
There are limits...

40:12.285 --> 40:16.449
...even for people like us.
Especially for people like us.

40:18.124 --> 40:21.912
When Kirk hired us to abduct Masha,
he also wanted me to kill you.

40:22.086 --> 40:24.418
I'm sorry I didn't take that job.

40:26.507 --> 40:28.293
Here's where we stand.

40:28.468 --> 40:30.424
Elizabeth Keen is dead...

40:30.595 --> 40:32.756
...which means you are too.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.796
Alexander Kirk is coming to kill you.

40:34.974 --> 40:38.057
The only surprise is
that I got to you first.

40:38.227 --> 40:40.809
You've killed a lot of people
trying to reach me.

40:40.980 --> 40:43.471
Well, here I am.

40:43.650 --> 40:45.186
Finish what you came to do.

40:46.611 --> 40:48.852
You have it all wrong, dear.

40:49.030 --> 40:50.270
I didn't come to kill you.

40:50.448 --> 40:53.656
I came here because you and I
are about to climb into bed together.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.737
Just for a quickie.

40:55.912 --> 40:58.278
We now share a mutual enemy.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.572
So let's get you bandaged up.

41:00.750 --> 41:05.585
Not that you aren't even lovelier
with a little blood trickling down your arm.
