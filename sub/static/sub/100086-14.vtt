00:00.023 --> 00:02.591
<i>Back in the '80s,
our teachers looked like this.</i>

00:02.635 --> 00:06.343
<i>They were sad-sacks,
angry-sacks, or lonely-sacks.</i>

00:06.445 --> 00:07.727
<i>But that all changed in college,</i>

00:07.770 --> 00:09.859
<i>when Barry actually had a hot teacher.</i>

00:14.147 --> 00:15.700
Pour some knowledge on me.

00:15.779 --> 00:16.867
Stop it, Barry.

00:16.959 --> 00:18.193
She is an intelligent woman

00:18.287 --> 00:20.217
who shouldn't be reduced
to just an object,

00:20.311 --> 00:22.095
and, oh, my God,
she's got cheekbones for days.

00:22.158 --> 00:23.943
Why would she be a T.A.

00:23.986 --> 00:25.292
when she could be holding a number

00:25.335 --> 00:27.555
to indicate what round it is
in a boxing match?

00:27.599 --> 00:29.470
The only thing I get is that
you're a super gross horn dog.

00:29.513 --> 00:30.819
But it's not just that.

00:30.863 --> 00:32.821
She actually makes me want to learn.

00:32.865 --> 00:34.127
I'm hot for teacher.

00:34.170 --> 00:35.389
Like the Van Halen song?

00:35.432 --> 00:37.870
That song perfectly captures
both her profession

00:37.913 --> 00:39.872
and my feelings towards that profession.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.264
Let me hand back your essays.

00:41.308 --> 00:42.570
Fantastic job.

00:42.614 --> 00:44.877
Shama-lama-ding-dong!
Erica dids it again.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.183
And, Barry, yours is in here somewhere.

00:47.227 --> 00:49.359
Oh, just look for the one with
the strawberry-jam fingerprints.

00:49.403 --> 00:50.796
Here it is.

00:50.839 --> 00:53.276
- Excellent job, as well.
- Yes!

00:53.320 --> 00:55.104
Smarty people in the house!

00:55.148 --> 00:56.932
What the hell? You got an A, too?

00:56.976 --> 00:58.847
Yeah. I cranked that bad boy out quick.

00:58.891 --> 01:00.501
That's Barry's number-one trick

01:00.544 --> 01:02.808
for academic success... Speed.

01:02.851 --> 01:04.723
There is no way we both earned A's.

01:04.766 --> 01:06.986
Erica, when you say things like that,

01:07.029 --> 01:09.858
it makes me think
you think I'm not intelligent.

01:09.902 --> 01:10.946
I don't.

01:10.990 --> 01:12.600
You are widely considered
stupider than me

01:12.644 --> 01:14.820
by family, society, and
any jacket with a zipper.

01:14.863 --> 01:16.125
That was one jacket!

01:16.169 --> 01:17.823
And you're just mad that I got
the same grade as you.

01:17.866 --> 01:19.302
Mr. Goldberg.

01:19.346 --> 01:20.303
Please see me after class.

01:20.347 --> 01:21.609
Oh, no.

01:21.653 --> 01:22.871
She must've realized that English

01:22.915 --> 01:24.873
isn't your second language.

01:24.917 --> 01:25.961
Knock, knock.

01:26.005 --> 01:28.007
Wow. Check out all these books.

01:28.050 --> 01:30.662
It's like that weird store
in the mall that sells books.

01:30.705 --> 01:32.925
Well, you've got to read a lot
of them if you want a PhD.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.056
I get it.

01:34.100 --> 01:36.058
I'm gonna be a doctor, too,
but, like, a real one

01:36.102 --> 01:38.060
who plays God and parks
wherever he wants

01:38.104 --> 01:39.235
and tells loved ones he tried

01:39.279 --> 01:40.628
but it's their nana's time.

01:40.672 --> 01:42.151
I knew you were funny.

01:42.195 --> 01:44.850
That paper you wrote comparing
Weber's theory of rationalization

01:44.893 --> 01:46.721
to LL Cool J's song "Big Ole Butt"

01:46.765 --> 01:47.853
made me laugh out loud.

01:47.896 --> 01:50.377
I am so glad!

01:50.420 --> 01:52.205
You're so cool and pretty

01:52.248 --> 01:55.643
and know all of LL Cool J's
masterwork on butts.

01:55.687 --> 01:57.210
Go out with me tonight.

01:57.253 --> 01:59.386
That's intense, considering
it's Valentine's Day.

01:59.429 --> 02:01.867
Oh, no, Barry. You asked
your dream woman out

02:01.910 --> 02:03.564
on the most romantically
charged day of the year?

02:03.607 --> 02:05.827
- It's okay.
- No, forget I said anything.

02:05.871 --> 02:08.090
I'll just drop the class and quit school

02:08.133 --> 02:11.267
and become a lowly sixth man
on a struggling NBA franchise.

02:11.311 --> 02:12.573
Don't become a Charlotte Hornet.

02:12.616 --> 02:14.793
You know the NBA?

02:14.836 --> 02:16.925
I can't take it.
Reveal your shortcomings.

02:18.274 --> 02:20.102
You know what? Let's do it.

02:20.146 --> 02:22.104
- Let's go out.
- Wait. For real?

02:22.148 --> 02:25.107
I'm sick of dating snobby, bookish guys.

02:25.151 --> 02:26.282
You are so not them.

02:26.326 --> 02:28.110
I haven't listened since you said yes,

02:28.154 --> 02:30.112
so your reasons are your reasons.

02:30.156 --> 02:31.810
But this needs to stay between us.

02:31.853 --> 02:33.855
If word got out, it wouldn't be good.

02:33.899 --> 02:35.982
I'll have no trouble
keeping it to myself.

02:36.052 --> 02:37.648
<i>Well, he'd have a little trouble.</i>

02:37.685 --> 02:39.034
- Hey, Big Tasty.
- What's new?

02:41.950 --> 02:43.321
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside ♪</i>

02:43.425 --> 02:47.220
<i>♪ But nonetheless,
I feel the need to say ♪</i>

<i>♪ I don't know the future ♪</i>

02:50.946 --> 02:53.994
<i>♪ But the past keeps getting

02:54.088 --> 02:55.964
<i>It was Valentine's Day, 1980-something,</i>

02:56.008 --> 02:58.140
<i>and for the first time in a long time,</i>

02:58.184 --> 03:00.447
<i>I had my eye on someone special.</i>

03:00.490 --> 03:01.578
<i>No, it wasn't Dana.</i>

03:01.622 --> 03:03.009
<i>We were now just friends.</i>

03:03.056 --> 03:05.408
<i>In fact, we were both
interested in other people.</i>

03:05.452 --> 03:08.237
Okay, I'm gonna ask Brea to
the Valentine's Couples Skate.

03:08.281 --> 03:09.848
Glasses on or off?

03:09.891 --> 03:11.327
I thought your eye wanders
when you take them off.

03:11.371 --> 03:13.068
Not if I close it.

03:13.112 --> 03:14.504
What do you think?

03:14.548 --> 03:16.289
- I'd keep them on.
- Good note.

03:16.332 --> 03:17.420
Let's do this.

03:17.464 --> 03:18.595
<i>The plan was perfect.</i>

03:18.639 --> 03:20.119
<i>Dana and I would have our dates,</i>

03:20.162 --> 03:22.077
<i>and it would be the best
Valentine's day ever!</i>

03:22.121 --> 03:24.819
- Brea, want to hit the skate thing?
- Sure.

03:24.863 --> 03:25.951
<i>Or not.</i>

03:25.994 --> 03:27.169
What just happened?

03:27.213 --> 03:29.563
From what I can glean
from your devastated looks,

03:29.606 --> 03:31.260
your crushes just crushed on each other

03:31.304 --> 03:32.840
and now you're crushed.

03:32.894 --> 03:35.489
<i>So Dana and I found a way
to deal with our misery</i>

03:35.525 --> 03:36.850
<i>in the healthiest way possible...</i>

03:36.897 --> 03:38.137
<i>Ice cream.</i>

03:38.180 --> 03:40.270
Here's to being totally cool
with not having a Valentine.

03:40.301 --> 03:43.098
There's my scrumptious Valentine!

03:43.142 --> 03:45.318
Come on, give Mama a... Oh, Dana!

03:45.361 --> 03:46.915
Hell no! Not again.

03:46.939 --> 03:48.462
Nice to see you, too, Mrs. Goldberg.

03:48.506 --> 03:50.869
Mom, I know you're not Dana's
biggest fan, but we're just friends.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.119
Oh, thank God.
I thought you were back together.

03:53.163 --> 03:55.208
In fact, we just found out
the two people we like

03:55.252 --> 03:57.333
are going with each other
to the Couples Skate.

03:57.380 --> 04:00.426
Wait, another harlot dares
toy with my baby's heart?

04:00.470 --> 04:01.514
I'm a person.

04:01.558 --> 04:03.212
Dana, this is not about you.

04:03.255 --> 04:05.040
I need to know her name,
where she lives,

04:05.083 --> 04:06.432
and what time she goes to sleep.

04:06.476 --> 04:07.520
Her name's Brea,

04:07.564 --> 04:09.000
and I've already said too much.

04:09.044 --> 04:11.176
Besides, it's not like
there's anything I can do.

04:11.220 --> 04:13.657
I waited too long, and Andrew
Gallery asked her first.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.398
If it's just a timing thing,
I can fix that.

04:15.441 --> 04:16.486
I'll just break them up.

04:16.529 --> 04:18.661
You couldn't really do that, could you?

04:18.704 --> 04:21.882
Let me tell you about Adam's
father's first love, Ilene.

04:21.926 --> 04:23.014
What about Ilene?

04:23.058 --> 04:25.704
She was an awful toad, Murray.
Don't interrupt.

04:25.766 --> 04:26.767
She was nice...

04:26.830 --> 04:29.118
You know, with the hair
and the face and the other stuff.

04:29.219 --> 04:31.240
I knew he and that expired bag of soup

04:31.283 --> 04:32.502
were wrong for each other,

04:32.545 --> 04:33.764
so I had no choice.

04:33.808 --> 04:35.344
I had to go into "preventa" mode.

04:35.430 --> 04:36.506
Preventa?

04:36.549 --> 04:38.682
A preventa is the opposite of a yenta.

04:38.725 --> 04:40.902
Instead of putting people
together, they tear them apart.

04:40.945 --> 04:42.594
I'm among the world's best at both.

04:42.680 --> 04:43.697
I liked her.

04:43.752 --> 04:46.476
She smelled like lavender,
she made me corn muffins.

04:46.559 --> 04:47.604
What did you do to her?

04:47.647 --> 04:49.301
She did it to herself, Murray,

04:49.345 --> 04:51.782
by writing that letter
to her ex-boyfriend.

04:51.826 --> 04:54.480
All I did was get it out of her mailbox,

04:54.524 --> 04:56.569
break into your car,
and leave it for you to read.

04:56.613 --> 04:58.173
- You did that?
- Yes.

04:58.301 --> 04:59.728
And today, you have a loving wife

04:59.806 --> 05:00.835
and beautiful children

05:00.878 --> 05:03.272
who don't look like
butter-filled pinatas.

05:03.315 --> 05:05.230
It all makes sense.

05:05.274 --> 05:08.799
So, the point of this
incredibly upsetting story

05:08.843 --> 05:11.236
is that you can break up two
teenagers so we'll find love?

05:11.280 --> 05:12.977
It's what a good mama does.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.153
- Thank you for the offer, but...
- We'd love your help.

05:15.197 --> 05:17.068
You seriously want to
involve my mom in this?

05:17.112 --> 05:19.505
I like Andrew, you like Brea.

05:19.549 --> 05:20.915
What other choice do we really have?

05:20.940 --> 05:22.465
We can wait them out.

05:22.508 --> 05:25.076
And after their marriage goes
stale and the kids move out,

05:25.120 --> 05:26.904
they'll agree to amicably go
their separate ways.

05:26.948 --> 05:28.166
Then we pounce like cats.

05:28.210 --> 05:30.647
Or we let your mom preventa it up.

05:30.690 --> 05:32.649
You are wise beyond
your appearance, Dana.

05:32.692 --> 05:34.694
It's on. I'll see you
in the den in five.

05:34.738 --> 05:36.261
This will end bad.

05:36.305 --> 05:38.785
<i>While we were enlisting
my mom's help with love,</i>

05:38.829 --> 05:41.266
<i>the JTP had their own romantic plans.</i>

05:41.310 --> 05:42.464
Hey, JTP.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.487
We thought we'd swing by
and check in on you guys.

05:44.530 --> 05:45.880
We know how lonely
Valentine's Day can be.

05:45.923 --> 05:47.794
But cheggit, you're all dressed up.

05:47.838 --> 05:50.188
- So I guess you found dates?
- And yet we did not.

05:50.232 --> 05:52.625
In fact, we have no
romantic prospects at all.

05:52.669 --> 05:54.062
So, in lieu of lady companionship,

05:54.105 --> 05:56.210
we decided to celebrate our friendship.

05:56.235 --> 05:58.675
We call it Pal-entine's Day.

05:58.718 --> 06:00.111
At least you improved the name,

06:00.155 --> 06:02.505
because last year's Valen-dudes Day
was a real big whiff.

06:02.548 --> 06:04.594
First, we're gonna go to Dante & Luigi's

06:04.637 --> 06:06.117
for a little linguine and laughs.

06:06.161 --> 06:08.166
Then a carriage ride
around Rittenhouse Square

06:08.228 --> 06:09.519
to see the city lights.

06:09.555 --> 06:12.297
Finally, ice-skating at this
rink my uncle manages.

06:12.341 --> 06:14.343
He's gonna let us use it after
hours, so it'll be just us.

06:14.386 --> 06:15.822
I know it sounds crazy, you guys,

06:15.866 --> 06:18.216
but I really think we could raise a baby.

06:18.260 --> 06:20.784
Hello, Geoffrey and sister.

06:20.827 --> 06:23.091
I thought it might be
St. Valentine himself here

06:23.134 --> 06:26.007
to smile down upon the
lovers, the dreamers,

06:26.050 --> 06:27.791
and those that are neither
loved nor dreamed about.

06:27.834 --> 06:30.141
Ohh, don't touch my face
with your bathroom hand.

06:30.185 --> 06:32.839
Is that Polo Sport
by Ralph Lauren I smell?

06:32.883 --> 06:35.233
Indeed. It's made from the
sweet sweat of wealthy ponies.

06:35.277 --> 06:37.322
Wait, Bar, you have a Valentine's date?
That's amazing.

06:37.366 --> 06:38.933
What's her name, Jennifer Canada?

06:38.976 --> 06:41.587
First of all, Ms. "Ca-nada"

06:41.631 --> 06:44.025
moved back to the part of
Manitoba with no phone service.

06:44.068 --> 06:45.156
That all sounds right.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.418
Tell us about this new special lady.

06:46.462 --> 06:48.551
Well, she's...

06:48.594 --> 06:50.683
<i>In that moment,
Barry remembered the promise</i>

06:50.727 --> 06:51.946
<i>he made to Elana.</i>

06:51.989 --> 06:53.251
She's made up. Erica's right.

06:53.295 --> 06:55.210
I'm just a big fat phony who has no one.

06:55.253 --> 06:57.386
When you just cop to it,
it kind of ruins the fun.

06:57.429 --> 06:59.431
Yeah, no fun for you or me.

06:59.475 --> 07:00.780
Anyway, I'm off to the library.

07:00.824 --> 07:03.174
With a box of chocolates and a blazer?

07:03.218 --> 07:05.960
Brain food and wearing my brain blazer

07:06.003 --> 07:08.179
because I got a date with my brain,

07:08.223 --> 07:10.921
and he's about to get very lucky.

07:10.965 --> 07:12.618
For what it's worth, you guys
would make great fathers.

07:12.662 --> 07:14.055
Oh.

07:14.098 --> 07:16.231
He's wearing a blazer, he smells
like Macy's, and he's happy?

07:16.256 --> 07:17.889
Something's up. We need to follow him.

07:19.408 --> 07:20.931
Holy crap!

07:20.975 --> 07:22.237
He's on a date with our teacher!

07:22.280 --> 07:23.368
Do you know what this means?

07:23.412 --> 07:25.936
Barry's hot for teacher,
and teacher's hot for him!

07:25.980 --> 07:27.807
No, he didn't write a good paper.

07:27.851 --> 07:29.592
He smooched his way to that A.

07:29.635 --> 07:31.898
Oh, right, this is about you.
I'll do better.

07:31.942 --> 07:33.944
<i>As Erica had discovered Barry's secret,</i>

07:33.988 --> 07:36.120
<i>my mom was about to share
a few of her own.</i>

07:36.164 --> 07:37.992
Who's ready to break up some teens?

07:38.035 --> 07:39.602
I still don't think this is a good idea.

07:39.645 --> 07:41.865
It is. I already bought
a cute skating outfit.

07:41.908 --> 07:44.085
I like this color on you, Dana.

07:44.128 --> 07:47.436
It's just, breaking up two people
for no reason seems kind of mean.

07:47.479 --> 07:50.439
What's mean is allowing
two people to stay together

07:50.482 --> 07:51.788
when there are other people out there

07:51.831 --> 07:53.311
who would make them happier.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.462
- Way happier, Adam.
- Okey-dokey.

07:55.532 --> 07:57.360
Since this seems to be
happening anyway, I'm in.

07:57.448 --> 08:00.274
Now, the first thing we need
to do is start a bogus rumor.

08:00.345 --> 08:03.321
He's a pyromaniac, and she sells
organs on the black market.

08:03.365 --> 08:04.627
Too dark.

08:04.670 --> 08:06.585
But I wish I knew this Dana before.

08:06.629 --> 08:07.978
Oh, I've got one.

08:08.022 --> 08:10.633
Now all we need is a gossipy
hen to run with it.

08:10.676 --> 08:12.069
I know just the hen.

08:12.113 --> 08:14.376
Get this. Andrew Gallery,

08:14.431 --> 08:17.161
who's already going to the
Valentine's Skate with Brea Bee,

08:17.205 --> 08:19.207
sent flowers to the field hockey team.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.252
What happened to
the sanctity of monogamy?

08:21.296 --> 08:23.950
I don't know, but keep this to yourself.

08:23.994 --> 08:26.431
Definitely don't tell anyone.

08:26.475 --> 08:28.259
How can I?

08:28.303 --> 08:30.044
How can I?

08:30.087 --> 08:33.083
By lunchtime, the rumor should
be the talk of the cafeteria.

08:33.162 --> 08:34.482
Won't Andrew just deny it?

08:34.525 --> 08:37.006
Of course he will. But that
brings us to step two...

08:37.037 --> 08:38.139
Plant evidence.

08:38.182 --> 08:39.467
But it's not true.

08:39.530 --> 08:41.638
Why would I send flowers
to the field hockey team?

08:41.684 --> 08:42.763
They're 4-9.

08:42.809 --> 08:44.754
Thanks for the flowers, Andrew.

08:44.797 --> 08:46.060
I don't understand this!

08:46.103 --> 08:47.800
I do. You got busted.

08:47.844 --> 08:50.455
Have fun with all those plaid
skirts at the Valentine's Skate.

08:50.499 --> 08:52.066
And, finally, step three,

08:52.109 --> 08:53.328
be there to pick up the pieces.

08:53.371 --> 08:54.720
Hey, Brea.

08:54.764 --> 08:56.505
I heard what that coward did to you.

08:56.548 --> 08:58.159
Just know there are some
good guys out there.

08:58.202 --> 08:59.334
What was I thinking?

08:59.377 --> 09:00.857
There's no way to know.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.946
But... I'm here now.

09:02.989 --> 09:04.513
Thanks, Adam.

09:04.556 --> 09:06.515
Your mom really raised you well.

09:10.214 --> 09:12.618
<i>While my mom had preventa'd
another relationship,</i>

09:12.672 --> 09:15.828
<i>nothing was preventing Barry and his
hot teacher from hitting it off.</i>

09:15.872 --> 09:16.960
You ordered cupcakes?

09:17.003 --> 09:18.396
Or, as I like to think of them,

09:18.440 --> 09:19.919
muffins after dark.

09:19.963 --> 09:21.312
There's just no neat way to eat them.

09:21.356 --> 09:23.401
Well, maybe there is
something I can teach you.

09:23.445 --> 09:26.448
All you do is you take the top off,
put the bottom on top.

09:26.491 --> 09:28.711
You got yourself
a little cupcake sandwich.

09:28.754 --> 09:30.147
You don't mess around.

09:30.191 --> 09:32.032
One day, I hope to show you
my work with waffles.

09:32.915 --> 09:34.499
I want you to see the best in me, Elana.

09:34.543 --> 09:35.727
You know what?

09:35.805 --> 09:37.071
I'm having a pretty great time.

09:37.141 --> 09:38.399
Me too.

09:40.070 --> 09:41.158
Oh! No!

09:41.202 --> 09:43.552
- I'm so sorry!
- Don't worry.

09:43.595 --> 09:45.866
I'll just... I'll be right
back and we can try again.

09:46.555 --> 09:48.631
- Busted.
- What are you doing here?

09:48.656 --> 09:50.820
Finding out exactly how you got that A.

09:50.863 --> 09:53.475
- You're trading your body for grades.
- It's not like that.

09:53.518 --> 09:54.954
Whatever it is, it's awesome.

09:54.998 --> 09:56.173
Dude, you're hot for teacher!

09:56.217 --> 09:57.218
Thanks, buddy. You're a good friend.

09:57.261 --> 09:58.784
- Stay out of this, Geoff.
- On it, yeah.

09:58.828 --> 09:59.959
I just got to ask...

10:00.003 --> 10:01.570
Has she ever given you, like, a pop quiz

10:01.613 --> 10:02.788
but then the quiz is just kissing?

10:02.832 --> 10:04.660
- Geoff!
- Sorry, babe.

10:04.703 --> 10:06.270
Follow-up question...
Has she ever started class

10:06.314 --> 10:07.576
by emerging from behind a curtain,

10:07.619 --> 10:09.317
wearing nothing but a bikini and a sash?

10:09.360 --> 10:10.753
Dude! I didn't know this side of you.

10:10.796 --> 10:11.841
It's always been in there!

10:11.884 --> 10:14.278
Shh! You need to leave right now!

10:14.322 --> 10:15.801
I promised her I'd keep this a secret.

10:15.845 --> 10:17.760
No one can know! Just... go.

10:17.803 --> 10:20.154
Get over yourself. No one cares
about your disgusting love life.

10:20.197 --> 10:21.372
It's true, JTP.

10:21.416 --> 10:23.679
Barry's hot for teacher,
and teacher's hot for him.

10:23.722 --> 10:25.376
When I get clarity on the
sash, I'll call back.

10:25.420 --> 10:27.949
Oh, God. The JTP knows!

10:28.805 --> 10:30.089
It's already too late.

10:31.582 --> 10:33.908
<i>Barry swore he'd keep
quiet about dating his teacher.</i>

10:33.933 --> 10:36.588
<i>Unfortunately, the JTP told everyone.</i>

10:36.631 --> 10:40.113
I'm telling you, if word gets out,
Elana and I are done.

10:40.157 --> 10:42.027
Relax, Bar. No one even
listens to the JTP.

10:42.052 --> 10:44.605
- You're fine.
- Barry Goldberg, you da man.

10:44.630 --> 10:45.786
Okay.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.364
I mean, that could be completely
unrelated. You are da man.

10:48.389 --> 10:52.212
I suppose there's the possibility
it's completely unrelated.

10:52.256 --> 10:53.953
Bro, congrats on dating Elana,

10:53.997 --> 10:55.955
your smokin' hot sociology teacher.

10:55.999 --> 10:58.044
Okay, that was pretty specific.

10:58.088 --> 11:00.394
But I'm sure Elana won't even find out!

11:00.438 --> 11:02.048
I know everything, Barry.

11:02.092 --> 11:03.354
About sociology

11:03.397 --> 11:05.443
and not that our
super-sexy secret got out?

11:05.486 --> 11:06.966
You told everyone,

11:07.010 --> 11:09.055
not to mention there were
27 very aggressive apples

11:09.099 --> 11:10.187
on my desk this morning.

11:10.230 --> 11:11.275
They are in season.

11:11.318 --> 11:12.580
I liked you.

11:12.624 --> 11:14.017
But, for you,

11:14.060 --> 11:15.670
this was clearly an adolescent fantasy

11:15.714 --> 11:17.411
based on some Motley Crue song.

11:17.455 --> 11:18.804
It's Van Halen.

11:18.847 --> 11:21.676
God, I can't believe
I could lose my job over this.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.181
Thanks for nothing, Barry.

11:23.206 --> 11:26.064
<i>While word of Barry's hot
teacher had spread like wildfire,</i>

11:26.142 --> 11:27.711
<i>my mom was trying to stoke the flames</i>

11:27.743 --> 11:29.062
<i>of my romance with Brea.</i>

11:29.087 --> 11:30.059
What are you doing?

11:30.102 --> 11:32.407
As you know,
I used my preventa abilities

11:32.432 --> 11:35.522
to destroy Brea's
previous Valentine's date.

11:35.566 --> 11:36.828
Those are words.

11:36.872 --> 11:39.613
And now I'm waiting for Adam
to use this study session

11:39.657 --> 11:40.963
to ask her out.

11:41.006 --> 11:42.747
Oh, why doesn't he do it already?

11:42.790 --> 11:43.966
If I had to come up with something,

11:44.009 --> 11:45.184
it's because he's a giant wussbag.

11:45.228 --> 11:46.316
Murray!

11:46.359 --> 11:47.621
Don't blame me. I didn't raise him.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.358
Oh, I got to get down there
and turn up the heat.

11:49.389 --> 11:50.320
Well, good luck.

11:50.363 --> 11:53.149
I set the temperature to 66,
and I ripped off the knob.

11:53.192 --> 11:55.586
Who wants some nummy snacks?

11:55.629 --> 11:57.718
No, thanks, Mom. We kind of
got something going on here.

11:57.762 --> 11:58.850
Mm, doesn't look like it,

11:58.894 --> 12:00.199
and I've got the perfect thing

12:00.243 --> 12:02.332
to help rev up those study engines...

12:02.375 --> 12:04.725
Chocolate-covered strawberries.

12:04.769 --> 12:06.249
Go on. Feed each other.

12:06.292 --> 12:07.772
Wait. Did you say "feed each other"?

12:07.815 --> 12:09.426
What a great idea, huh?

12:09.469 --> 12:11.080
Just do what comes naturally.

12:11.123 --> 12:13.517
It seems natural that you'd
leave so we can study.

12:13.560 --> 12:17.216
Come on, close those books and
crack open a conversation.

12:17.260 --> 12:20.045
Oh, here's a topic...
Adam likes ice-skating.

12:20.089 --> 12:21.525
Thoughts, Brea?

12:21.568 --> 12:24.397
The only thing that comes to
mind is, "What's going on?"

12:24.441 --> 12:26.660
What's going on is this stereo.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.488
Ah.

12:28.532 --> 12:30.490
Don't you just love R&B?

12:30.534 --> 12:32.492
Feel the rhythm of the night.

12:32.536 --> 12:33.972
What the hell, lady?

12:34.016 --> 12:36.757
What's with the erotic fruit
and sensuous music?

12:36.801 --> 12:38.205
I did not break up Brea

12:38.229 --> 12:40.239
and her boy toy to have you
sit on the sidelines, Adam.

12:40.283 --> 12:42.241
I-I'm gonna do it.
Just give me a minute.

12:42.285 --> 12:44.287
- I'll give you two.
- That's a tight window!

12:44.330 --> 12:46.134
Well, it is what it is.
Now go show some fight.

12:47.290 --> 12:49.056
Is... Is everything okay?

12:49.142 --> 12:52.034
Yeah. I-I just need to
ask you something.

12:52.077 --> 12:54.992
Would you be interested in...

12:55.024 --> 12:56.262
<i>This was it.</i>

12:56.299 --> 12:57.909
<i>My mom's plan had led to this moment.</i>

12:57.953 --> 13:00.085
<i>All I had to do was pop the question.</i>

13:00.129 --> 13:01.986
...doing next week's lab
so we can get ahead?

13:02.011 --> 13:03.045
Oh.

13:03.088 --> 13:04.655
Oh, no. Is the power out?

13:04.698 --> 13:06.831
No. This is much worse.

13:06.874 --> 13:08.328
Look who found a study candle.

13:08.353 --> 13:09.529
You know what they say,

13:09.573 --> 13:11.444
everyone learns better in low light.

13:11.488 --> 13:12.880
I can't see anything.

13:12.924 --> 13:15.361
Just scooch in, share the flame.

13:15.405 --> 13:17.146
<i>As my mom refused to let up,</i>

13:17.189 --> 13:19.646
<i>Barry wasn't gonna let Erica
off the hook.</i>

13:19.671 --> 13:20.709
You.

13:20.741 --> 13:21.895
You did this!

13:21.933 --> 13:23.108
I'm still hot for teacher,

13:23.152 --> 13:24.501
but she is no longer hot for me.

13:24.544 --> 13:25.632
Oopsie-doopsy.

13:25.676 --> 13:27.286
Did I ruin your inappropriate affair

13:27.330 --> 13:29.375
so now you actually
have to earn your grade?

13:29.419 --> 13:31.315
You can't accept I earned
the same grade as you?

13:31.340 --> 13:32.862
I cannot, because you did not.

13:32.887 --> 13:34.946
You're unbelievable!

13:34.990 --> 13:38.080
Did you know this was the first
girl I liked since Lainey?

13:38.123 --> 13:40.050
Please, do not try to convince me that

13:40.097 --> 13:41.960
- this thing with our teacher is real.
- Why not?

13:41.997 --> 13:44.303
Maybe because you're shaped
like Grimace from McDonald's?

13:44.347 --> 13:46.349
Oh, thank you. That purple
gumdrop is a delight.

13:46.392 --> 13:47.480
He is not a delight.

13:47.524 --> 13:49.830
Grimace is a simpleton
with short, useless arms.

13:49.874 --> 13:51.919
He could still carry a shake!

13:51.963 --> 13:54.873
And his clumsy antics are the
perfect foil for Ronald.

13:54.898 --> 13:57.055
- He gets the job done.
- What job?

13:57.099 --> 13:59.144
And, oh, my God,
it's conversations like this

13:59.188 --> 14:01.581
that make me certain our
hot teacher couldn't like you.

14:01.625 --> 14:03.061
You never believe I could be something

14:03.105 --> 14:04.149
other than your dumb brother.

14:04.193 --> 14:05.281
That's not what I'm saying.

14:05.324 --> 14:08.327
For the first time
in a really long time,

14:08.371 --> 14:10.634
I had an amazing Valentine's Day.

14:10.677 --> 14:12.199
And you ruined it.

14:12.224 --> 14:13.692
- Thanks a lot.
- Barry, wait.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.222
I always thought Ronald McDonald

14:16.247 --> 14:17.945
looked a lot like my Uncle Allen.

14:17.989 --> 14:20.513
<i>As Erica had made a
mess of Barry's love life...</i>

14:20.557 --> 14:21.906
<i>...my mom had to do</i>

14:21.949 --> 14:23.473
<i>some romantic cleanup of her own.</i>

14:23.516 --> 14:24.561
Hi, Mrs. Goldberg.

14:24.604 --> 14:26.640
I could really use your help.

14:26.703 --> 14:29.261
See, Andrew still hasn't asked
me to the Valentine's Skate.

14:29.305 --> 14:30.393
I'm worried he's still into Brea.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.699
Damn it, Dana, do I need to
put on a Dana costume

14:32.743 --> 14:34.061
and finish the job myself?

14:34.086 --> 14:35.180
Why are you yelling at me?

14:35.224 --> 14:37.095
You said you were good
at this preventa stuff.

14:37.139 --> 14:38.602
I can lead a horse to water,

14:38.627 --> 14:41.032
but I can't make it drink
a tall glass of blech.

14:41.057 --> 14:42.978
- No offense.
- How do I not take offense to that?

14:43.022 --> 14:44.502
Look, you'll be fine.

14:44.545 --> 14:46.808
You'll marry rich, he'll
get bored after a month,

14:46.852 --> 14:48.419
and you'll clean up in the divorce.

14:48.462 --> 14:51.683
Right now the only love life
I'm concerned with is Adam's.

14:51.726 --> 14:53.119
Well, he better move fast,

14:53.163 --> 14:55.513
because Andrew's determined
to get Brea back.

14:55.556 --> 14:56.644
Okay, quick. What's Brea into?

14:56.688 --> 14:58.429
- Um...
- Okay, pick up the pace.

14:58.472 --> 14:59.865
No wonder Andrew has a wandering eye.

14:59.908 --> 15:00.909
She likes the band New Edition.

15:00.953 --> 15:02.433
I can work with that.

15:02.476 --> 15:05.305
As for you, give him these strawberries.

15:05.349 --> 15:08.308
And when he talks, you just nod a lot.

15:08.352 --> 15:10.397
But doesn't that just play
into ugly gender roles?

15:10.441 --> 15:12.714
- You will never find love.
- But I...

15:12.739 --> 15:15.370
<i>Yep, time was running out
to seal the deal with Brea.</i>

15:15.424 --> 15:18.057
Bro, you got to ask her out
before someone else does.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.277
I would, but she's half my age.

15:21.843 --> 15:23.323
Okay. I'm going in.

15:26.848 --> 15:29.460
This song goes out to the
lovely Brea... From Adam.

15:29.503 --> 15:30.896
Good God, no.

15:30.939 --> 15:32.463
♪ Brea, girl ♪

15:32.506 --> 15:34.073
♪ You are Adam's world ♪

15:34.116 --> 15:36.684
♪ It would be so great ♪

15:36.728 --> 15:39.165
♪ If you were his date ♪

15:39.209 --> 15:41.559
♪ He really, really, really, really ♪

15:41.602 --> 15:43.125
♪ Wants you to be his date ♪

15:47.042 --> 15:48.893
I'm a rock guy, but sometimes
good is just good.

15:48.918 --> 15:51.699
- You!
- Always pull through? I know.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.006
I told you I'd handle it on my own.

15:54.049 --> 15:57.314
But I found out that Andrew
is still hung up on Brea.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.664
He was gonna swoop right in,
and then you'd have no date.

15:59.707 --> 16:00.926
So what?

16:00.969 --> 16:02.797
This doesn't have
anything to do with you.

16:02.841 --> 16:04.582
Sweetie, we are in this together.

16:04.625 --> 16:06.584
When you hurt, I hurt.

16:06.627 --> 16:09.108
Are you also feeling
the overwhelming humiliation

16:09.151 --> 16:10.453
you just caused me?

16:10.478 --> 16:13.286
No, I'm actually still buzzing
from that amazing jam.

16:13.330 --> 16:14.505
Well, you're right about one thing.

16:14.548 --> 16:16.115
You're a great preventa,

16:16.158 --> 16:19.188
'cause you just made sure
me and Brea have no chance.

16:21.860 --> 16:23.078
<i>After losing Elana,</i>

16:23.122 --> 16:25.124
<i>Barry paid a visit to the head
of her department.</i>

16:25.167 --> 16:29.076
Professor Lee, there's this awesome
rock song about inappropriate love

16:29.101 --> 16:30.624
I'm trying to base my life on.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.180
You mean that deafening noise

16:32.205 --> 16:34.454
made by morally questionable gentlemen?

16:34.493 --> 16:36.625
- You're not a fan of rock?
- Only the ones I paint.

16:36.669 --> 16:38.018
This is one of my most recent.

16:38.062 --> 16:40.064
Oh, that's lovely!

16:40.107 --> 16:42.718
You got a medium-size one
and a little fella,

16:42.762 --> 16:44.155
and, look, there's a boulder.

16:44.198 --> 16:46.070
You know your rock sizes.

16:46.113 --> 16:48.159
So, is Elana in trouble
for going out with me?

16:48.202 --> 16:49.421
It's certainly frowned upon,

16:49.464 --> 16:52.250
but there's nothing
in the code of conduct

16:52.293 --> 16:54.208
that says a teacher
can't date a student.

16:54.252 --> 16:55.427
- There isn't?
- Nope.

16:55.470 --> 16:57.081
Had there been, I wouldn't have met

16:57.124 --> 16:58.734
my one and only sexual partner...

16:58.778 --> 17:00.562
My wife of 30 years.

17:00.606 --> 17:01.999
That's great...

17:02.042 --> 17:03.696
I mean, not about your old wife,

17:03.739 --> 17:05.393
but Elana's not getting in trouble?

17:05.436 --> 17:07.656
She's not... Unless she gave you
a grade you didn't deserve.

17:07.700 --> 17:08.743
She gave me an A.

17:08.788 --> 17:10.268
- I'm calling the dean.
- Oh, no!

17:10.310 --> 17:12.118
- Hang up that phone.
- Who are you?

17:12.144 --> 17:13.184
She's his sister.

17:13.227 --> 17:14.532
Geoff, I can speak for myself.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.105
- I'm his sister.
- Nailed it, babe.

17:16.130 --> 17:18.666
And here's the thing...
Barry earned that A.

17:18.711 --> 17:23.063
Barry's paper was smart,
creative, and oddly persuasive.

17:23.107 --> 17:24.455
You really liked it?

17:24.499 --> 17:25.544
I did.

17:25.587 --> 17:27.675
And I'm sorry I was so
petty and competitive.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.113
The fact is, you are so much smarter

17:29.156 --> 17:30.331
than I give you credit for.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.507
Thanks. That means a lot.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.813
It's true.

17:33.856 --> 17:35.963
And you deserve to go out with
Elana if that's what you want.

17:36.685 --> 17:38.513
- Then go.
- Okay.

17:38.549 --> 17:40.422
- All of you go!
<i>- With that,</i>

17:40.447 --> 17:43.083
<i>Barry knew just what to do
to fix his Valentine's Day,</i>

17:43.127 --> 17:45.912
<i>and I couldn't forgive my mom
for ruining mine.</i>

17:45.955 --> 17:47.000
Damn it, Adam, open up.

17:47.044 --> 17:48.697
You can't stay angry at me forever.

17:48.741 --> 17:50.264
I can, and I will.

17:50.308 --> 17:52.484
Hey. What's going on here?

17:52.527 --> 17:55.095
I hired a boy band
without Adam's knowledge

17:55.139 --> 17:57.141
to help lock down his Valentine's date,

17:57.184 --> 17:59.439
and for some reason, he's mad at me.

17:59.926 --> 18:01.014
That doesn't sound good.

18:01.058 --> 18:02.537
I can still fix it.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.235
I just need you to call the school,

18:04.278 --> 18:05.845
say you're Brea's dad,

18:05.888 --> 18:07.225
and demand her class schedule.

18:07.288 --> 18:09.631
How 'bout I do nothing
and you stay out of it?

18:09.675 --> 18:11.764
If I stayed out of it
with you and Ilene,

18:11.807 --> 18:14.027
you'd be married
to that sack of wet corn.

18:14.071 --> 18:16.551
Bevy, you and I being together

18:16.595 --> 18:20.642
has nothing to do
with you preventa'ing Ilene.

18:20.686 --> 18:21.948
'Course it does.

18:21.991 --> 18:24.168
No, I just liked you.

18:24.211 --> 18:27.907
Well, yeah, but she had the, uh...
The face and the stuff.

18:27.932 --> 18:30.083
You had everything.

18:30.696 --> 18:32.263
Oh, Murray.

18:32.310 --> 18:35.995
If this girl likes Adam,
it'll work out for him, too.

18:41.410 --> 18:44.174
Schmoo?

18:46.451 --> 18:49.062
I'm sorry I interfered with Brea.

18:49.106 --> 18:50.744
You ask her when you're ready.

18:54.459 --> 18:56.971
But what if she says no?

18:56.996 --> 18:58.680
Is that what you've been afraid of?

18:58.724 --> 19:00.508
I just like her so much.

19:00.552 --> 19:02.684
Well, you're never gonna know
if you don't ask.

19:02.728 --> 19:05.034
But I don't want to mess it up.

19:05.078 --> 19:09.430
Yeah, I might not be
impartial, but, uh...

19:09.474 --> 19:11.911
Anyone would be a fool to say no to you.

19:16.350 --> 19:18.586
<i>Turns out the scariest thing you can do</i>

19:18.688 --> 19:20.500
<i>is put yourself out there.</i>

19:20.572 --> 19:22.313
<i>But then you do, and you realize</i>

19:22.356 --> 19:24.880
<i>it was exactly what you needed
to move forward.</i>

19:24.924 --> 19:26.839
- So, no one's in trouble?
- Not even a little.

19:26.882 --> 19:28.536
And, even better, we can go out again.

19:28.580 --> 19:31.539
Here's the thing, Barry.
I don't think we should.

19:31.583 --> 19:32.801
Oh.

19:32.845 --> 19:34.629
You're a great guy.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.370
It's just not a good idea.

19:37.893 --> 19:39.373
That sucks, but I get it.

19:39.417 --> 19:40.766
I hope you're okay.

19:41.201 --> 19:42.811
I am.

19:42.855 --> 19:45.249
And I think it's time
to get myself back out there.

19:45.292 --> 19:47.251
Thanks for helping me realize that.

19:47.294 --> 19:49.122
Whoever that ends up being,

19:49.166 --> 19:50.384
she's a lucky lady.

19:50.428 --> 19:53.246
Not as lucky as the guy
who ends up with you.

19:54.475 --> 19:55.418
Barry, wait.

19:56.216 --> 19:57.347
One for the road?

Thank you. That was awesome.

20:12.915 --> 20:15.844
<i>And, sure, sometimes it
doesn't work out how you imagined,</i>

20:15.888 --> 20:18.456

chance, you'll never know</i>

20:18.499 --> 20:20.719
<i>if your dreams could become a reality.</i>

20:20.762 --> 20:23.156
I'm glad you asked me.
What took you so long?

20:23.200 --> 20:25.376
Just waiting for the right moment.

20:25.419 --> 20:28.509
<i>Because at the end of the day,
love is about finding someone</i>

20:28.553 --> 20:30.772
<i>who makes every day feel like a dream.</i>

20:38.780 --> 20:41.004
- Brea Bee.
- Hi!

20:42.794 --> 20:45.628
This really has been the
best Pal-entine's Day ever.

20:45.653 --> 20:46.856
My heart is full.

20:46.887 --> 20:49.190
So is my stomach.
That pasta was amazing.

20:49.278 --> 20:51.193
Oh! And the carriage ride?

20:51.237 --> 20:53.761
Even though we didn't have a
blanket, I still felt toasty.

20:53.804 --> 20:54.849
Let's finish strong.

20:54.892 --> 20:57.025
Okay.

21:21.868 --> 21:23.225
- We need girlfriends.
- So bad.

21:23.269 --> 21:24.492
Let's never speak of this.
