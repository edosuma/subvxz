03:15.289 --> 03:16.879
Look at me.

03:19.877 --> 03:21.135
I said look at me.

03:28.386 --> 03:29.477
Danny!

03:30.555 --> 03:31.646
Danny, it's me, mate.

03:32.140 --> 03:33.267
Your old mate Mickey!

03:35.143 --> 03:36.982
Here, Jack, have a look.
You'll never guess who it is.

03:37.061 --> 03:38.188
It's only young Danny.

03:38.438 --> 03:39.731
- Our Danny?
- Yeah.

03:41.399 --> 03:42.610
Danny?

03:47.071 --> 03:49.242
What the fuck's he doing
in a motor with Tony and Pat?

03:49.407 --> 03:52.753
Yes, Dan. What are you doing
in a motor with Tony and Pat?

03:52.994 --> 03:54.834
I thought you had more sense than that.

03:54.996 --> 03:57.760
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't know no Tony.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.220
That was me mate Jeff.

04:09.344 --> 04:11.184
Are you telling us that ain't Tony T?

04:13.724 --> 04:14.934
Jack, what do you reckon?

04:15.058 --> 04:16.149
Erm...

04:17.144 --> 04:18.485
Don't know, Mickey.

04:20.272 --> 04:21.613
I shot him in the face.

04:22.274 --> 04:23.366
Oh...

04:24.151 --> 04:25.243
No.

04:28.238 --> 04:30.374
Oh, mate, what a fucking mess.

04:32.201 --> 04:34.171
I'm so sorry, Dan. I feel so embarrassed.

04:38.124 --> 04:39.511
How about the other geezer in the back?

04:39.625 --> 04:40.836
- Paul
- Paul

04:41.127 --> 04:43.132
Paul, Paul, Paul.

04:43.296 --> 04:44.719
- Jack.
- Yo.

04:45.256 --> 04:47.641
- Did you shoot the other geezer in the...
- Yep.

04:48.676 --> 04:50.064
Shot him in the face, too.

04:52.805 --> 04:54.277
I don't know what to say, mate.

04:55.558 --> 04:57.777
Feel terrible. Terrible.

04:58.645 --> 05:00.068
Look at your motor.

05:00.146 --> 05:02.151
I've left it in a right two and eight, ain't I?

05:04.025 --> 05:05.532
- It's all right.
- No it ain't, Dan.

05:05.735 --> 05:07.206
- Because there's blood.
- Brains.

05:07.362 --> 05:09.746
And brains.
And that ain't never gonna come out.

05:09.823 --> 05:10.914
Never.

05:19.624 --> 05:21.096
Probably them, innit?

05:23.795 --> 05:28.351
Right, Dan, listen we got to slip away.
But you be lucky, yeah.

05:30.385 --> 05:32.889
- Right, Jack, let's crack on, son.
- Let's do it.

05:33.639 --> 05:36.142
- Third time lucky.

05:36.225 --> 05:38.111
It was the end of an era

05:41.188 --> 05:42.860
Well, for them lot anyway.

05:46.944 --> 05:49.198
For me, it was only the beginning.

05:49.780 --> 05:52.959
But before the pills and the clubs,
the birds, the booze,

05:53.033 --> 05:56.082
the torture and the tracksuits,
there was football.

05:56.203 --> 05:59.585
And more importantly,
football-related violence.

06:00.207 --> 06:04.300
Because as far back as I could remember,
I always wanted to be an hooligan.

07:44.189 --> 07:46.490
Well, I suppose we'd better start
near the beginning.

07:46.649 --> 07:47.823
School.

07:47.901 --> 07:51.993
What a shithole. But we made the most of it.

07:52.656 --> 07:54.577
Oh, have a look. That's me there.

07:55.033 --> 07:56.504
That's me best mate Fanta.

07:59.162 --> 08:01.926
And this wanker is Mr Burroughs.

08:01.998 --> 08:03.505
Something funny, Johnson?

08:03.667 --> 08:04.924
No, sir.

08:06.378 --> 08:07.849
Passing notes.

08:08.964 --> 08:11.514
Come on then. Come up to the front.

08:12.175 --> 08:15.059
We're all very keen to share the joke.

08:16.221 --> 08:17.313
Yes, sir.

08:20.976 --> 08:22.447
Ooh!

08:22.519 --> 08:25.200
Like I said, wanker.

08:30.819 --> 08:33.537
- It says that you had...
- To the whole class.

08:35.533 --> 08:39.328
It says that you had Freddie Fitzpatrick
round your house for extra maths tuition.

08:40.203 --> 08:41.544
Really, Johnson?

08:41.871 --> 08:45.171
And that you made him watch
while you touched your willy.

08:47.044 --> 08:49.678
And then bent him over
and tongued his butthole.

08:54.052 --> 08:56.021
- Anything else?
- Yeah, there's a picture here and all.

08:56.220 --> 08:57.561
Well, that's you, sir.

08:59.515 --> 09:01.106
And that's obviously you, Freddie.

09:05.563 --> 09:08.328
Johnson, you're going to end up
just like your father.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.903
Now this didn't sound like
such a bad thing to me.

09:11.194 --> 09:13.246
But I got the feeling he meant it as an insult.

09:13.738 --> 09:15.328
You wanna make one with me, son, do ya?

09:15.407 --> 09:18.372
That's me old man, Danny Senior,
the fucking legend.

09:18.451 --> 09:21.085
You want to make one with me?
Do you know who I am?

09:21.246 --> 09:23.880
Do you know who I am?
What you looking at?

09:24.207 --> 09:25.963
Come on then, oh, come on their attack...

09:26.168 --> 09:28.007
It was a shame he had
to ruin the game, though,

09:28.086 --> 09:29.427
because I wasn't a bad little player.

09:29.630 --> 09:31.800
Right, it's fucking on now.

09:31.882 --> 09:34.847
A scout from Man United came to our school
once and tried to get me to sign.

09:34.927 --> 09:36.101
Done you a favour there, son.

09:36.178 --> 09:38.265
That mob are never gonna
amount to nothing.

09:38.722 --> 09:40.229
- Hold that, mush.
- Mr Johnson.

09:40.307 --> 09:41.944
This is a school. Mr Johnson!

09:48.148 --> 09:51.162
Yep, my old man loved football.

09:51.235 --> 09:52.362
Never back down, son.

09:52.611 --> 09:56.953
Do you hear me? Always stand your ground.
Stand your ground!

09:58.451 --> 10:00.787
So I took a leaf out
the old man's book and said.

10:00.953 --> 10:03.587
Fuck off, you two-bob slag.

10:08.169 --> 10:11.467
Of course it turns out Burroughs
was fiddling Freddie Fitzpatrick after all.

10:11.589 --> 10:13.475
And they told me
I could come back to school

10:13.591 --> 10:14.802
But fuck that.

10:15.301 --> 10:19.726
Mr Johnson, due to your complete
lack of remorse for your crime

10:19.806 --> 10:24.231
and your repeated failure to show any signs
of wanting to change your lifestyle,

10:24.310 --> 10:26.316
I sentence you to five years.

10:27.564 --> 10:29.984
Without possibility of parole.

10:30.275 --> 10:32.197
Bailiff, take the prisoner down.

10:32.277 --> 10:35.077
Five years.
He could have done it standing on his head.

10:35.155 --> 10:36.626
Oh, yeah.

10:36.698 --> 10:37.825
Order!

10:37.908 --> 10:40.244
He ended up getting 30 years
for head-butting the bailiff,

10:40.368 --> 10:43.750
spitting on the clerk of the court,
booting this ginger bird in the face

10:43.872 --> 10:45.379
and assaulting the judge.

10:45.457 --> 10:47.592
You fucking knob. You fucking knob!

10:47.668 --> 10:51.262
The newspaper said he was the first man
in history to make a judge eat his own syrup.

10:51.338 --> 10:53.094
Eat the fucking wig!

10:53.173 --> 10:55.392
Fucking legend.

10:55.467 --> 10:58.231
And with me still a boy,
I was sent to live with me granddad Albert,

10:58.303 --> 11:00.143
while me old man was sent to do his bird.

11:01.765 --> 11:05.111
- What time's dinner in this gaff, Fur Face?
- Keep moving, scumbag.

11:05.185 --> 11:06.277
What the fuck's that all about then?

11:51.399 --> 11:53.451
Now, now, 4737.

11:53.568 --> 11:55.869
We don't want any trouble
like we had last year.

11:57.906 --> 12:00.160
The boys here have all clubbed together.

12:01.159 --> 12:04.541
Bought you a little hat, to say sorry.

12:08.792 --> 12:10.215
Very well.

12:11.003 --> 12:14.052
Happy birthday, 4737.

12:15.883 --> 12:17.436
Enjoy your cake.

12:19.928 --> 12:21.601
Baron.

12:33.651 --> 12:35.905
Oi, oi, Granddad. What's happening?

12:36.320 --> 12:38.740
What's for dinner? I am fucking Hank Marvin.

12:53.254 --> 12:54.547
What the fuck's all this then, Granddad?

12:56.549 --> 12:58.519
What the fuck's all this?

12:58.635 --> 13:00.806
What you talking about, you dozy little mare?

13:00.929 --> 13:03.313
I told you, I'm moving to Australia with Cyril.

13:03.640 --> 13:04.683
Since when?

13:04.766 --> 13:08.029
I told you months ago to get your own place.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.572
What you been doing all this time, hmm?

13:10.814 --> 13:13.364
Sitting on your arse smoking weed
with that ginger faggot.

13:13.942 --> 13:15.449
I thought I could just live here.

13:15.527 --> 13:19.454
I told you, Dan, I sold the place.
Moving to warmer climes.

13:21.950 --> 13:23.587
Nothing left for me around 'ere.

13:24.494 --> 13:26.381
What am I supposed to do?

13:27.289 --> 13:28.499
Time to grow up, son.

13:28.790 --> 13:30.546
Make something of your life.

13:31.209 --> 13:34.223
Do the fucking collar, get some reddies.

13:37.633 --> 13:38.926
So what you gonna do then?

13:43.263 --> 13:45.150
Don't take this the wrong way, mate,

13:45.224 --> 13:48.652
but recently I've been starting to think
there's got to be something more than this.

13:48.727 --> 13:50.898
You ain't gonna get a job, are you?

13:53.190 --> 13:56.654
No, what I'm saying is my old man
was a legend. A face.

13:58.195 --> 13:59.488
Look at me.

14:00.573 --> 14:03.337
You know, I want to be someone.
Want to be part of something.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.794
Okay, here's another one. Oi, mate!

14:10.249 --> 14:11.886
Fucking brilliant.

14:12.752 --> 14:16.050
Yeah, this has been fun and all, mate, but I
gotta chip back home and pick up me stuff.

14:16.172 --> 14:18.557
Oh, Dan, mate, why don't you
stay round mine a couple of days,

14:18.633 --> 14:19.926
just until you get back on your feet?

14:20.760 --> 14:22.848
No, don't worry about me, mate. I'm sweet.

14:22.929 --> 14:24.768
This time next week
I'll bell you from me penthouse.

14:24.848 --> 14:26.354
- Yeah?
- Yeah, fucking right, mate.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.197
We'll have a proper party.
Birds, booze, the lot.

14:29.936 --> 14:33.365
Oh, mustard, mate! Here we go.
Have a look. Oi, love!

14:33.732 --> 14:37.244
Oh, fuck off, you pair of melts.
That's the oldest trick in the book.

14:40.781 --> 14:42.252
Ooh!

14:46.578 --> 14:49.378
Yeah, anyway, as I was saying,
go get your stuff and I'll meet you later on.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.137
We can have a few bevvies.
Celebrate your independence.

14:52.251 --> 14:54.719
On me. Fancy an ice cream?

14:54.795 --> 14:56.765
- Yeah, go on then, mate.
- What flavour?

14:56.839 --> 14:58.678
- Anything. Don't get lemon.
- All right.

15:01.885 --> 15:05.729
Oh, my fucking God!
It's her off the telly.

15:05.806 --> 15:07.562
Oh, shit. Yeah, it is.

15:10.436 --> 15:13.449
Time to go, 4737.

15:14.064 --> 15:16.070
You're a free man today.

15:19.236 --> 15:20.328
Baron!

16:19.298 --> 16:21.018
You take care of yourself then, Dex.

16:21.091 --> 16:23.642
Don't you be getting
in no more trouble now, you hear.

16:23.719 --> 16:25.190
Fuck off, screw.

16:25.262 --> 16:27.065
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!

16:28.557 --> 16:30.313
Barry, it's happened again.

16:30.392 --> 16:32.896
Fucking how many times? I'm on fire again!

16:33.979 --> 16:35.107
Fucking burning!

16:36.691 --> 16:40.202
Chop, chop. We're gonna nip through
Harry Brown's tunnel. It's quicker.

17:00.465 --> 17:02.304
- Yeah, hello.

17:03.426 --> 17:06.973
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

17:07.055 --> 17:08.645
Karen! Karen!

17:08.765 --> 17:10.236
You called me, babe? What's the matter?

17:10.308 --> 17:12.194
Get our fucking kids out of here.

17:12.269 --> 17:15.233
Go round your mum's and don't come back
until I call you. All right?

17:15.313 --> 17:20.202
Oh, shit! Quick, kids! Get your fucking
coats on, we're going to your gran's!

17:20.318 --> 17:22.369
For fuck's sake, not again!

17:24.448 --> 17:27.627
I told you, "Never call my mobile."

17:27.701 --> 17:30.666
I got kids, for fuck's sake.

17:31.747 --> 17:33.088
- You wanker!

17:33.415 --> 17:34.459
But now they're out the way.

17:35.459 --> 17:36.966
Let's do this.

17:37.127 --> 17:40.010
Hola, my little Spanish prince.

17:40.673 --> 17:42.559
Tickle my front bottom, mate.

17:42.841 --> 17:43.933
What?

17:44.009 --> 17:45.896
Oh, yeah.

17:46.136 --> 17:48.023
I'm getting huge for you.

17:48.430 --> 17:52.393
Pablo, I want you to fuck me
like you did in Torremolinos.

17:52.476 --> 17:53.603
Do you remember, boy?

17:53.686 --> 17:54.778
Baron!

17:59.275 --> 18:00.912
Who the fuck is that?

18:00.985 --> 18:02.326
It's Dex.

18:02.945 --> 18:04.037
Who?

18:04.363 --> 18:06.203
- It's Dex.
- Hold on a minute.

18:08.201 --> 18:10.455
- Dexy boy.
- Baron!

18:10.536 --> 18:12.339
Finally let you out, did they?

18:12.413 --> 18:13.587
Oh, yeah, I'm out!

18:13.665 --> 18:14.708
And I'm coming for you!

18:16.125 --> 18:18.676
Oh, yeah. I think you'll find a lot's changed
since you went in.

18:18.753 --> 18:19.927
Oh, yeah?

18:20.004 --> 18:21.262
Yeah!

18:21.506 --> 18:23.476
Your mob's a fucking joke, son.

18:23.550 --> 18:26.100
Oh, and I've got top firm now.

18:26.177 --> 18:27.649
You're gonna get cut, Baron.

18:27.721 --> 18:29.274
And it's gonna be me that does it.

18:29.347 --> 18:30.688
Fucking hell.

18:31.141 --> 18:33.110
You couldn't hit water if you fell out a boat.

18:33.310 --> 18:35.362
I'm gonna slit you open like an envelope.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.821
You couldn't afford the postage.

18:38.273 --> 18:41.286
Yeah, I can.
And I'll send it recorded delivery and all.

18:41.359 --> 18:42.451
In that case,

18:42.527 --> 18:44.864
I won't be here to sign for it.

18:48.241 --> 18:54.542
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck you, Baron!

18:55.541 --> 18:57.178
Fuck it!

19:06.677 --> 19:09.014
- You sure about this, mate?
-'Course, mate. It's a shortcut.

19:09.096 --> 19:11.018
What's the matter? You shook?

19:11.891 --> 19:13.314
Well, yeah, a bit.

19:14.393 --> 19:18.404
Come on, you melt.
What's there to be scared of?

19:18.898 --> 19:20.286
Well, him for one.

19:25.196 --> 19:26.833
Stay with me if you like.

19:34.414 --> 19:36.549
Come on, tubby bollocks.

19:44.215 --> 19:46.018
Every time I stroke 'em.

19:48.636 --> 19:49.728
Come on, Dan.

19:51.973 --> 19:54.228
What did I tell you, it ain't that bad, is it?

19:54.351 --> 19:57.032
All right. That's Muggy Keith, that is.

19:58.355 --> 19:59.696
Sweet.

20:00.565 --> 20:02.617
Now I knew we shouldn't have
gone down that tunnel.

20:03.193 --> 20:07.155
But little did I know what would happen now
would change my life forever.

20:07.239 --> 20:09.707
You need to stop being such a pussy.
You're in safe hands.

20:09.783 --> 20:10.957
I'm a boat mate.

20:12.786 --> 20:14.127
Give me a cigarette.

20:14.538 --> 20:16.009
Sorry, mate, we don't smoke.

20:16.749 --> 20:17.840
We?

20:21.378 --> 20:22.422
Fuck.

20:22.504 --> 20:25.601
Well, give me your wallet
and I'll buy my own cigarettes.

20:26.300 --> 20:27.890
I'd never been mugged before.

20:27.968 --> 20:30.223
But in that moment I thought
what my old man had taught me.

20:30.304 --> 20:31.727
Never back down, son!

20:31.806 --> 20:33.562
Always stand your ground!

20:34.725 --> 20:35.817
No!

20:36.560 --> 20:37.818
What do you mean, "No"?

20:38.604 --> 20:40.075
I mean no, Kojak.

20:40.481 --> 20:42.735
Now if you want my wallet,
you're gonna have to come and take it.

20:42.817 --> 20:44.074
You peel-headed Si.

20:44.151 --> 20:46.488
It felt good. I felt powerful.

20:46.946 --> 20:50.458
My old man was right.
Never back down. Never give 'em an inch.

20:50.533 --> 20:52.834
Oh, I realised no one had ever
stood up to this guy before.

20:52.910 --> 20:55.379
I saw the fear wash over him like a...

20:55.622 --> 20:57.009
Oh, shit!

20:57.832 --> 20:59.920
Now, you gobby little shite,

21:00.502 --> 21:02.222
let's get something straight.

21:04.798 --> 21:08.641
This ain't a skinhead. It's alopecia.

21:09.260 --> 21:10.388
Yeah.

21:11.054 --> 21:12.976
It's a medical condition.

21:13.431 --> 21:15.437
- I've lived with this all my life.
- Yeah.

21:16.226 --> 21:17.982
Look at it.

21:18.436 --> 21:21.201
Have you any idea what it's like
growing up a hairless child?

21:22.274 --> 21:23.318
No.

21:23.525 --> 21:24.818
Hairless!

21:25.944 --> 21:27.534
Look, I'm really sorry, mate.

21:27.863 --> 21:29.251
Too late now.

21:29.865 --> 21:32.629
Now you're gonna get cut.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.005
You, me.

21:50.052 --> 21:52.556
Let's fucking have it, yeah? Fucking have it!

21:56.267 --> 21:58.153
Get me outta here.

21:58.894 --> 22:00.105
Yeah, you better run.

22:07.069 --> 22:08.909
Oi, mate. Mate.

22:10.782 --> 22:12.075
Thanks for back there.

22:12.617 --> 22:14.918
I could have handled it,
but me pal left me high and dry.

22:16.371 --> 22:19.088
Was that that ginger boy I saw
at the other end of the tunnel?

22:19.707 --> 22:21.713
Yeah. Yeah, was he all right?

22:22.001 --> 22:24.172
No. He was crying.

22:25.755 --> 22:27.558
And some geezer was stroking him.

22:31.177 --> 22:32.601
How's the nose, mate?

22:33.638 --> 22:35.228
It's all right.

22:37.476 --> 22:38.947
Took me stuff, though.

22:39.269 --> 22:40.942
Everything I own was in that bag.

22:42.230 --> 22:43.358
Hold still.

22:50.948 --> 22:52.075
You'll live.

22:53.659 --> 22:55.130
You did well back there, son.

22:55.494 --> 22:56.917
You stood your ground.

22:57.246 --> 22:59.630
And that's the most important thing.

22:59.748 --> 23:00.922
Thanks.

23:02.126 --> 23:03.253
I'm Dexter.

23:03.794 --> 23:04.921
Yeah, I know.

23:05.671 --> 23:06.763
I'm Danny.

23:06.922 --> 23:08.892
'Course I knew who he was.

23:08.966 --> 23:12.063
Dad told me stories all about Dex
and his crew when I was a kid.

23:12.762 --> 23:15.063
They were the hardest
football firm in the country.

23:15.139 --> 23:17.524
And Dex, he was their top boy.

23:18.893 --> 23:20.020
Come on.

23:28.569 --> 23:29.780
This is me.

23:30.196 --> 23:32.201
Oh, right. Yeah.

23:32.949 --> 23:35.286
Well, I guess I'll see you around then, yeah?

23:39.080 --> 23:40.919
- Danny.
- Yeah.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.803
Do you want to come for a pint?

23:45.670 --> 23:47.592
Yeah, mate, yeah. Sweet.

23:47.714 --> 23:48.806
Come on then.

23:50.175 --> 23:51.728
What else was
I gonna do on a Saturday?

23:54.012 --> 23:55.400
What an honour.

23:55.472 --> 23:58.604
I was walking into the legendary Iron Hoof
with the man of the hour.

24:01.019 --> 24:02.407
I felt drunk.

24:02.521 --> 24:04.158
Oh, my head was spinning.

24:04.231 --> 24:07.328
This is what I'd been searching for,
to belong.

24:08.402 --> 24:11.914
Everyone wanted to talk to Dex
and because I was with him,

24:12.156 --> 24:15.418
they all wanted to talk to me.
It was like a family.

24:15.492 --> 24:17.829
And he introduced me to everyone.

24:17.995 --> 24:20.629
There was Dexy and me
and there was Billy Bo Bells.

24:20.706 --> 24:23.043
Welcome home, Dex. Hold the bells.

24:23.250 --> 24:24.804
Scrimshank Stanley.

24:24.877 --> 24:25.969
Looking good, son.

24:26.045 --> 24:29.509
Knees Up Leroy Brown
and his half-brother Andy Old Iron.

24:29.590 --> 24:30.978
Come toilet, got something for you.

24:31.050 --> 24:33.387
His "business associate”, Little Boy Blue,

24:33.761 --> 24:37.189
and his boys Nicky Mince Pies
and Freddy the Nonce.

24:37.264 --> 24:39.151
All right, Dex. Who's your little mate?

24:39.225 --> 24:40.352
Then there was Jimmy Two Times.

24:40.434 --> 24:42.404
He got that name
because he said everything twice.

24:42.478 --> 24:44.151
Gonna get the currant bun, currant bun.

24:44.230 --> 24:45.820
A lot of the lads got their names that way.

24:45.898 --> 24:46.990
Like Pete the Killer.

24:47.066 --> 24:48.407
Took care of that thing for you.

24:50.111 --> 24:51.203
Mike the Rapist.

24:51.279 --> 24:53.996
There you go, ladies.
One for you, and one for you.

24:54.073 --> 24:55.794
His sister, Rita the Man Eater.

24:57.202 --> 24:58.329
And John the Cunt.

25:01.790 --> 25:03.296
But they were just extras.

25:03.374 --> 25:06.589
In the back room I was about to meet
the real top boys.

25:06.753 --> 25:08.675
The ones that struck fear into the hearts

25:08.755 --> 25:11.140
of every other football hooligan
in the country.

25:11.299 --> 25:12.391
The Factory.

25:12.467 --> 25:13.559
You ready?

25:13.635 --> 25:15.142
Oh, he didn't need to ask.

25:15.220 --> 25:16.347
I'm ready.

25:16.513 --> 25:18.518
Now you're gonna be all right tonight
because you're with me.

25:19.808 --> 25:22.228
You do not want to be in there on your own.

25:22.394 --> 25:23.568
Understand?

25:24.688 --> 25:26.195
Welcome to my world, son.

25:26.273 --> 25:27.910
- All right, Dex?
- Hello, mate.

25:36.116 --> 25:38.371
What the fuck is this?
I thought it was meant to be a party!

25:42.331 --> 25:43.885
Too fucking right!

25:55.678 --> 25:56.971
Midnight!

26:04.604 --> 26:08.198
Midnight, back in the day
he was the original black hooligan.

26:08.316 --> 26:11.413
Come on then, you fucking two-bob tossers.

26:11.486 --> 26:13.989
In fact, I think he was
the only black hooligan.

26:14.072 --> 26:16.575
I'm gonna chop off your blood clot!

26:16.658 --> 26:18.994
He made a name for himself
when he ran onto the pitch in a cup final.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.331
Come on, lads. Let's fucking have 'em.

26:21.412 --> 26:24.378
And tried to kidnap Portsmouth's mascot,
the Pompey pigeon, with a homemade shank.

26:24.457 --> 26:28.088
Get back. I'll kill him. I'll fucking kill him!

26:28.169 --> 26:29.297
Fucking legend.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.900
Dex. Welcome home.

26:42.517 --> 26:44.854
You're looking sweet, son.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.907
This is all for you, bruv.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.736
- Who's your mate?
- It's the boy Danny.

26:50.567 --> 26:51.694
All right, Dan?

26:52.694 --> 26:56.206
Anything you want, son, birds, booze,
bit of the other, just let me know, all right?

26:56.365 --> 26:58.168
- Sweet.
- Hey, Dexy!

26:58.325 --> 27:01.208
Hold on, mate. I'm coming over.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.581
Trumpet.

27:04.248 --> 27:06.335
Part of the new breed of football hooligan.

27:06.417 --> 27:09.181
Prides himself on the fact he's
never even been to a football match.

27:09.253 --> 27:12.847
Never misses a tear-up and he's seen
Green Street 2 over 140 times.

27:12.923 --> 27:15.427
Oh, I'm telling you, mate,
it's better than the original.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.352
All right, crack on, son.

27:17.428 --> 27:19.433
But he's a fucking thief.

27:19.513 --> 27:21.316
And he'll nick anything
that's not nailed down.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.563
I'll bell you Thursday, Chelle.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.733
All right, Trumpet.

27:34.070 --> 27:35.541
Thank Christ you're back, Dex.

27:36.030 --> 27:38.748
Things have been all too quiet,
but now the King's returned,

27:38.825 --> 27:40.415
we can have a proper tear-up.

27:40.535 --> 27:42.374
Give me a chance
to break in my new chopper.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.884
It's good to see you, Trumpet.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.256
Who the fuck are you?

27:48.793 --> 27:49.885
That's Danny.

27:50.295 --> 27:53.178
Say the word, Dex,
and I'll carve your name in his boat.

27:54.299 --> 27:56.387
Well, I appreciate the thought, Trumpet.
I really do.

27:56.676 --> 27:58.017
But he's all right. He's with me.

27:58.095 --> 27:59.352
Yeah?

28:00.180 --> 28:01.438
Hold out your hand.

28:01.932 --> 28:03.024
Eh?

28:03.100 --> 28:05.105
Hold your fucking hand out
and let me see how old you are.

28:20.451 --> 28:21.494
23, Gemini.

28:21.577 --> 28:23.796
- Oh, he's good. That is good.
- Fucking sweet.

28:23.996 --> 28:26.464
Fucking hell, that is unbelievable.
How did you do that?

28:26.582 --> 28:28.836
A magician never reveals his secrets.

28:29.126 --> 28:33.137
And by the way, you're one step away from
a free corn on the cob

28:33.214 --> 28:35.053
at Papa Poulet's Chicken Palace.

28:36.634 --> 28:37.975
That's a touch.

28:44.475 --> 28:45.649
He's got my wallet, ain't he?

28:45.810 --> 28:47.281
'Fraid so, son.

28:57.530 --> 28:58.657
Weasel!

28:58.740 --> 29:02.252
The thing about Weasel is
he didn't have the best start in life.

29:02.911 --> 29:05.675
His mum had been having a fling
with a young boy called John,

29:05.747 --> 29:08.132
but she had to break it off
when her fella got her pregnant.

29:08.208 --> 29:11.720
To say young John took it badly,
would be a bit of an understatement

29:37.946 --> 29:42.004
Baby. Baby, baby, baby, relax.
Relax, baby. Relax, baby. Baby.

29:42.076 --> 29:44.875
I did this to prove how much I love you.

29:47.289 --> 29:50.303
I love you, baby. I did this for both of us.

29:53.087 --> 29:54.807
Poor bastard never stood a chance.

29:54.922 --> 29:57.936
He was a crackhead before he was even born.

30:00.011 --> 30:01.221
Fucking result.

30:09.604 --> 30:11.276
You all right, Dexy, mate?
You look a bit down.

30:12.523 --> 30:14.410
No, I'm sweet, son. Sweet.

30:16.069 --> 30:17.575
Look, I'm glad I got you on your own

30:17.654 --> 30:19.575
because I want to talk to you
about my missus.

30:21.408 --> 30:24.421
Why? What you heard?

30:26.121 --> 30:28.457
Well, you took care of her
and that while I was inside.

30:29.332 --> 30:30.886
Oh.

30:31.167 --> 30:34.679
Right. Think nothing of it, bruv.

30:37.257 --> 30:41.350
I don't want to seem ungrateful, mate,
but, as you know, I was a long time gone.

30:41.928 --> 30:43.352
Too long, mate.

30:43.430 --> 30:44.853
Fucking right too long.

30:45.349 --> 30:48.861
And while I was inside I had one thing
on my mind and one thing only.

30:49.186 --> 30:51.191
- The Baron.
- Baron.

30:52.564 --> 30:54.118
Now he needs to get what's coming to him.

30:54.274 --> 30:55.366
Yeah.

30:55.818 --> 30:58.867
When I left we were the most violent,
blood-thirsty bunch of cunts in London.

30:58.946 --> 31:00.287
Yeah.

31:00.364 --> 31:03.543
Now tell me, Midnight, where do we stand?

31:06.871 --> 31:08.258
Where do we stand?

31:09.749 --> 31:11.635
When was the last time
we had a proper tear-up?

31:12.376 --> 31:17.300
Funny thing is, mate, recently when we show
up for a ruck, we get a reception from plod.

31:19.342 --> 31:20.813
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:21.969 --> 31:23.725
How long's that been going on?

31:23.805 --> 31:26.438
- Don't know. A couple of years.
- Fucking filth.

31:28.976 --> 31:30.697
Well, I'm here now.

31:31.646 --> 31:33.651
We'll take plod by surprise.

31:34.941 --> 31:36.780
When's the rest of the boys coming down?

31:39.362 --> 31:40.489
Erm...

31:42.115 --> 31:43.954
Well, this is it, mate.

31:48.663 --> 31:49.956
What do you mean this is it?

31:51.333 --> 31:52.460
Where's the old guard?

31:52.792 --> 31:54.216
- Where's Bobby Iron?
- He got ironed out.

31:54.294 --> 31:55.386
- By who?
- West Ham.

31:55.462 --> 31:56.636
- The Irons?
- Yeah.

31:56.713 --> 31:58.267
- What about Tommy Gun?
- Gunned down.

31:58.340 --> 31:59.432
- By who?
- Arsenal.

31:59.508 --> 32:00.551
What, the Gunners?

32:00.634 --> 32:03.482
Next thing you'll be telling me, Midnight,
is Barry the Hammer got beaten to death

32:03.553 --> 32:05.060
with his own hammer
on the steps of Upton Park!

32:05.138 --> 32:08.068
- So you read about it then?
- No, I didn't fucking read about it, Midnight!

32:16.650 --> 32:18.406
At least no one went down to Fulham, hey?

32:18.485 --> 32:19.613
Cottaging.

32:26.702 --> 32:29.170
You know, Fulham. Cottagers.

32:31.415 --> 32:33.467
What do you know about the Cottagers, boy?

32:35.044 --> 32:36.136
Erm...

32:37.213 --> 32:38.387
Nothing.

32:39.048 --> 32:40.306
It was just a joke, mate.

32:40.383 --> 32:43.182
As you probably know by now
I weren't one for backing down,

32:43.261 --> 32:45.064
but I weren't stupid either.

32:45.138 --> 32:46.229
I knew who this was

32:46.305 --> 32:49.983
This was Bullet,
Dex's right-hand man and a total nutter.

32:50.059 --> 32:53.986
First of all, I ain't your fucking mate, boy.

32:56.566 --> 32:57.907
And second,

33:00.153 --> 33:02.240
the Cottagers ain't no joke.

33:04.574 --> 33:06.579
You don't know you're born, do you?

33:08.078 --> 33:10.925
- You ever been down there?
- What? The Cottagers?

33:11.540 --> 33:13.592
Yeah. The big boys.

33:15.252 --> 33:19.179
'Cause I have. I've been there.

33:20.424 --> 33:23.010
We all have. Ain't we, boys?

33:23.093 --> 33:24.351
Yeah!

33:24.428 --> 33:26.647
Balls deep in shit.

33:27.431 --> 33:31.523
Hands grabbing at you from all angles.
Faces screaming.

33:31.769 --> 33:35.530
People you've never even met before
coming right in your face.

33:36.649 --> 33:38.701
That's when you find out
who your mates are.

33:39.193 --> 33:41.364
They're the ones who are right behind you.

33:41.445 --> 33:43.497
Packed in. Tight.

33:44.949 --> 33:49.339
That's what separates
us real men from little poofs like you.

33:51.372 --> 33:53.757
So come on then, Dex, who's the dry lunch?

33:53.833 --> 33:56.253
Drop him out, Bullet. He's just a kid.

33:57.211 --> 33:58.682
Welcome home, son.

34:05.303 --> 34:08.020
- Who the fuck are you?
- This is Bill.

34:08.598 --> 34:09.938
Allo, allo, allo.

34:10.141 --> 34:11.980
Pleasure to meet you at last, Dex.

34:12.310 --> 34:14.647
- What's the problem, Dex?
- What's the problem, Dex?

34:14.728 --> 34:16.781
- You're amongst friends now, mate.
- Am I?

34:16.898 --> 34:19.318
'Course you are. This geezer's Old Bill.

34:20.275 --> 34:22.531
He's been inside too long.
He's getting paranoid.

34:22.654 --> 34:26.034
Dex, he's sweet, mate. Old Bill's been
following us about for a while now.

34:26.199 --> 34:28.002
- How long?
- Couple of years.

34:32.664 --> 34:35.215
Sorry. Yeah. Can't be too careful.
You understand.

34:35.625 --> 34:39.505
Roger that. So, what were we talking about?

34:40.464 --> 34:41.757
Rucks, was it?

34:55.437 --> 34:57.359
I've seen nothing like it before.
It was fucking huge, mate.

35:16.042 --> 35:18.462
Oh, fuck, come on, Trumpet,
we're gonna be late for work.

35:20.546 --> 35:22.717
- What do you do?
- Florists.

35:24.509 --> 35:26.181
- What, all of you?
- Yeah.

35:26.886 --> 35:29.686
Obviously. Except for Bill of course.

35:30.723 --> 35:32.396
Why? What do you do, Bill?

35:35.186 --> 35:38.734
Why are you so interested in what we all do?
You undercover?

35:39.023 --> 35:40.234
What?

35:40.358 --> 35:43.906
'Cause if you are, you have to tell us.
It's the law.

35:45.614 --> 35:47.453
I don't think it is, Weasel, mate.

35:47.824 --> 35:49.746
So you know all about it then, do you?

35:49.951 --> 35:52.003
- Cozzer.
- Actually, he's quite right.

35:52.162 --> 35:55.756
Section 4, Paragraph 2 of
the Metropolitan Police Code of Conduct

35:55.957 --> 35:59.090
states that an officer only has to
identify himself at the point of arrest.

36:05.259 --> 36:06.730
Apparently.

36:09.138 --> 36:12.400
I don't know how he does it.
He's a fountain of knowledge, this geezer.

36:12.474 --> 36:14.277
Where do you get it all from?

36:16.937 --> 36:19.867
He's bailed you out there, son.
That's one you owe him.

36:21.775 --> 36:23.282
That's enough.

36:23.819 --> 36:25.789
No one's going to work today.

36:26.238 --> 36:29.620
Go home, sort yourselves out,
and meet back at my house.

36:29.700 --> 36:30.792
Lively.

36:30.868 --> 36:33.039
- Dex, mate, I don't...
- You don't what?

36:34.622 --> 36:35.714
Nothing.

36:37.708 --> 36:41.386
That's right, nothing.
My house, couple of hours.

36:43.297 --> 36:44.970
- Savvy?
- Sweet.

36:55.518 --> 36:57.986
- I feel rough.
- Get cleaned up back at mine.

36:58.813 --> 37:01.494
- Thanks, Dex.
- And don't worry about Bullet.

37:01.691 --> 37:03.613
He just don't like outsiders, that's all.

37:03.943 --> 37:06.162
- Well, he seems to like Bill enough.
- Yeah.

37:06.947 --> 37:09.450
Something not quite right about that one.

37:09.533 --> 37:11.953
Yeah, I thought that and all
I mean, you don't think he's...

37:12.244 --> 37:14.165
I don't miss a trick, boy.

37:15.580 --> 37:17.420
The geezer's undercover.

37:20.502 --> 37:22.258
Undercover journo.

37:39.813 --> 37:41.451
- Sharon!
- Who's that?

37:41.524 --> 37:42.864
- It's your husband.

37:49.073 --> 37:50.829
Now don't you start crying, princess.

37:51.033 --> 37:55.126
Dexy. Why didn't you call?
I must look terrible.

37:56.789 --> 37:58.260
No.

37:58.749 --> 37:59.841
You look beautiful.

38:02.545 --> 38:04.930
I've missed you so much.

38:05.214 --> 38:07.054
We've fucking missed you and all.

38:08.301 --> 38:10.638
- Where is it?
- He's there.

38:10.929 --> 38:13.397
Playing with his toys,
waiting to meet his daddy.

38:14.390 --> 38:17.320
Well, go on then, come and say hello.

38:20.063 --> 38:21.570
Go on, mate, it's all right.

38:23.858 --> 38:25.116
Right.

38:37.497 --> 38:38.625
My boy.

38:45.255 --> 38:47.426
Apple didn't fall far from the tree, did it, Dan?

38:49.051 --> 38:52.016
Ah! It's like two peas in a pod, mate.

38:52.971 --> 38:54.312
I know.

38:54.640 --> 38:57.986
I used to sit and play with my toys as well.
All the time.

39:00.688 --> 39:03.487
- Grab it for me, babe, I want to hold it.
- All right, babes.

39:03.941 --> 39:05.614
You are his daddy.

39:07.778 --> 39:10.626
His undisputed biological daddy.

39:16.621 --> 39:18.423
Dex, you might as well
be looking in a mirror, mate.

39:18.498 --> 39:20.135
Yeah, I know.

39:20.458 --> 39:22.048
Two peas in a fucking pod.

39:24.128 --> 39:27.094
Dan, mate. You don't mind
holding my kid for me, do you?

39:27.423 --> 39:28.716
Oh, no, of course not, mate.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.136
I'm just gonna go get some things for later,
you know what I mean?

39:31.261 --> 39:32.554
Come on, babe.

39:32.637 --> 39:34.938
- Hey, what's his name?
- It's fucking Curtis.

39:35.098 --> 39:36.486
'Course it is.

39:42.981 --> 39:46.861
Don't worry, babes.
Your room's just how you left it.

40:24.982 --> 40:26.370
Baron.

40:39.038 --> 40:43.463
Baron! Baron! Baron! Baron!

40:43.918 --> 40:48.509
- Baron! Baron! Baron!
- Babe. Babe.

40:48.589 --> 40:49.800
- Baron!
- Babe!

40:49.882 --> 40:50.974
- Baron!
- Dexter!

40:51.050 --> 40:53.471
What? What? What?

40:53.553 --> 40:54.894
It's Sharon.

40:56.514 --> 40:57.902
Right. Sorry, babe.

40:59.309 --> 41:03.401
Sharon. Sharon.

41:05.607 --> 41:06.900
Sharon.

41:09.444 --> 41:10.536
Sharon.

41:19.746 --> 41:21.253
That's my son.

41:25.294 --> 41:28.391
That picture was taken of us
before I got sent down.

41:28.547 --> 41:29.758
Oh, where is he, your son?

41:35.179 --> 41:37.765
It was the mid '80s.
And we were in our prime.

41:38.265 --> 41:40.567
No firm in London could touch us.

41:42.978 --> 41:45.197
It was the last game of the season.

41:45.272 --> 41:47.858
And we had one more firm to turn over.

41:47.942 --> 41:49.662
Dexter!

41:50.861 --> 41:54.076
- I'm calling you out.
- Well, here I am.

41:54.448 --> 41:56.454
And we didn't think you'd show.

41:56.534 --> 41:58.788
We've battered every firm in the country.

41:58.870 --> 42:01.420
Why wouldn't we show up to school
a second-rate outfit like yours,

42:01.497 --> 42:02.969
you two-bob shithead?

42:03.666 --> 42:07.676
Well, you're in bandit country now!
There ain't no going back!

42:07.795 --> 42:10.097
South London. I shit 'em.

42:12.467 --> 42:17.141
I see you've brought your boy with you.
Now you mind he don't get hurt.

42:17.305 --> 42:18.693
Shut up, you mug.

42:19.641 --> 42:23.022
- You fucking little shit.
- You want some, Baron?

42:24.312 --> 42:25.985
Come fucking get some!

42:27.315 --> 42:28.442
Come on!

42:42.873 --> 42:44.843
Dad! Dad!

42:45.083 --> 42:46.376
Move.

42:46.460 --> 42:48.263
Dad! Dad!

42:53.342 --> 42:55.228
Dexter!

43:07.022 --> 43:09.110
He'd be about your age now.

43:12.028 --> 43:14.531
I swore that day I'd avenge my son's death.

43:15.948 --> 43:19.128
And settle the score with the one person
I hold accountable.

43:19.202 --> 43:20.293
Hello, Dexter.

43:20.536 --> 43:21.628
Baron!

43:21.704 --> 43:24.883
So, finally found your way home, did ya?

43:25.208 --> 43:28.055
- I just had to pick up a present for ya.
- Oh, yeah?

43:28.920 --> 43:31.340
I've a little surprise waiting for you and all.

43:31.422 --> 43:33.309
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

43:34.551 --> 43:36.307
Don't waste my time, scum.
What do you want?

43:36.636 --> 43:39.317
All right. Slow down, son.
Just a courtesy call.

43:40.056 --> 43:43.568
Just to make sure
you ain't gonna bottle it tonight.

43:44.269 --> 43:48.065
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

43:48.148 --> 43:51.660
I've been waiting a long time
to be in the same room as you.

43:51.860 --> 43:53.912
Well, do try and contain yourself.

43:53.987 --> 43:58.210
It's a gentleman's rendezvous this evening,
not Tottenham away.

43:58.992 --> 44:00.997
You'll keep.

44:01.578 --> 44:04.508
But when the time comes, Baron,

44:04.581 --> 44:08.639
I'm gonna open you up like a village fete,
you saucy slag.

44:08.794 --> 44:09.886
Dexy.

44:10.629 --> 44:13.429
Don't bring another boy with ya.

44:14.300 --> 44:17.479
Finished. Finished. Hang up. Hang up.
Fucking hell.

44:21.515 --> 44:22.642
I'll get that, mate.

44:27.813 --> 44:28.941
Oh.

44:29.023 --> 44:31.823
You're the fucking butler now,
are you, lunch?

44:31.901 --> 44:34.749
- Fucking mug.
- Exactly.

44:35.613 --> 44:37.285
I'll stick the kettle on, Dex.

44:40.618 --> 44:42.339
Oh, fucking sweet.

44:42.412 --> 44:43.799
Nunchucks.

44:45.498 --> 44:47.171
Quite a collection you got there, Dex.

44:47.250 --> 44:48.887
I bet this lot has seen some action.

44:48.960 --> 44:50.052
You're fucking right they have.

44:50.211 --> 44:51.338
Ooh!

44:51.421 --> 44:55.098
- This looks particularly nasty.
- Well, of course, it fucking is.

44:55.175 --> 44:58.271
Dexter used that to stove in
Jimmy Higgins' head.

44:58.636 --> 45:00.973
Look. You must have heard about that, Bill.

45:02.307 --> 45:06.898
Yeah. I bet the gavvers would like
to get their hands on this bit of evidence.

45:06.978 --> 45:12.661
Why are you so interested, Bill?
You writing a book, are ya?

45:14.986 --> 45:16.992
Who brought the filth?

45:19.491 --> 45:22.754
Come on. Who's the pig?

45:22.828 --> 45:24.418
Finally, someone sees it.

45:24.496 --> 45:29.253
Of course, I see it. I could smell it
as soon as I came down the stairs.

45:30.878 --> 45:32.431
Weasel!

45:32.504 --> 45:35.304
Look at the turnout
you've left all over my Persian.

45:35.382 --> 45:37.601
- Fuck's sake!
- Oh, Weas!

45:38.177 --> 45:40.264
I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry, Dex.

45:40.346 --> 45:42.517
Now get your shoes off and take 'em outside.

45:43.641 --> 45:46.358
Hello. Ooh!

45:49.397 --> 45:50.607
Midnight.

45:51.023 --> 45:52.495
Sharon.

45:53.651 --> 45:56.237
- How's the little one?
- He's good.

45:57.196 --> 45:59.581
Nice having his daddy in the house again.

45:59.657 --> 46:00.784
I bet it is.

46:03.369 --> 46:06.217
Hello, Sharon, love.
How do you take your coffee?

46:06.289 --> 46:07.499
Black.

46:07.582 --> 46:10.132
- Like her men. Hey, boys?
- Hey.

46:11.503 --> 46:13.175
Sharon, do me a favour and fuck off.

46:14.547 --> 46:16.434
I want to talk to the boys.

46:21.554 --> 46:23.642
So I trust
you're all ready for the meet tonight?

46:23.723 --> 46:25.230
We are now, mate.

46:25.684 --> 46:26.775
You, too, Dan.

46:27.394 --> 46:29.695
- Yeah, mate.
- Hold on, dry lunch.

46:29.771 --> 46:32.737
You want to run with the foxes,
you got to get bloodied first.

46:34.151 --> 46:35.408
What?

46:38.030 --> 46:39.832
Now, Danny.

46:39.907 --> 46:44.379
I want you to put your hands together
for my friend and yours,

46:44.453 --> 46:46.375
Stanley.

46:46.663 --> 46:48.051
What you going to do with that?

46:58.092 --> 46:59.978
Oh, Jesus.

47:00.344 --> 47:02.017
He won't help ya.

47:06.392 --> 47:07.946
That's poison, that is.

47:16.235 --> 47:18.953
Don't bottle it in front of your new mate.

47:22.742 --> 47:25.625
Well, if you're gonna fucking do it,
then fucking do it.

47:28.456 --> 47:32.087
All right, fuck it. Give it 'ere. I'll do it myself.

47:37.006 --> 47:39.059
Oh, my God.

47:41.469 --> 47:42.513
Oh, you...

47:44.180 --> 47:45.355
Oh, my goodness.

47:46.892 --> 47:48.482
Well, he's ruined your grouting.

47:54.649 --> 47:56.452
Dan, mate, are you done?

47:56.902 --> 47:58.290
Yeah, mate.

48:00.197 --> 48:02.036
Well, you're gonna laugh.

48:14.211 --> 48:16.014
Want an ice cream, mate?

48:16.839 --> 48:18.227
Birds 'll love it.

48:20.217 --> 48:22.436
Dex, mate, can you do me a favour, geez?

48:22.553 --> 48:23.645
Mmm?

48:23.846 --> 48:26.100
Well, anything. You're in the Factory now.

48:26.182 --> 48:27.523
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

48:27.600 --> 48:28.988
Congratulations.

48:29.060 --> 48:32.109
Great. Can you...

48:32.188 --> 48:34.608
Can you call me an ambulance?

49:39.089 --> 49:42.020
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

49:44.970 --> 49:47.474
I'd like to thank you all for coming
and welcome ya

49:47.556 --> 49:53.524
to the 25th annual meet of the Hooligan
Association of the United Kingdom.

49:53.604 --> 49:55.692
- Come on!
- Yeah!

49:57.108 --> 50:02.625
Right then. I wanted to open up the floor
to any new business.

50:03.448 --> 50:06.794
Yeah. The honourable gentleman from
South of the River.

50:10.288 --> 50:12.507
That's you, Slasher.

50:20.840 --> 50:22.477
My friends,

50:23.677 --> 50:27.307
I look around and I see a lot of new faces.

50:28.306 --> 50:29.599
Some of which I've slashed.

50:31.351 --> 50:33.736
Some of ya I look forward to slashing
in the seasons to come.

50:37.065 --> 50:38.655
My fellow hooligans.

50:40.152 --> 50:44.661
What I'm about to say concerns us all.

50:48.619 --> 50:53.507
Who in this room
has got an autobiography coming out?

50:55.834 --> 50:57.425
For fuck's sake.

50:57.920 --> 51:00.850
This is what I'm talking about, Baron!

51:05.469 --> 51:07.356
Order!

51:07.847 --> 51:09.353
Sit down, Slasher.

51:11.183 --> 51:15.110
What we have here is
what's known as market saturation,

51:15.188 --> 51:19.328
hence forth all book releases
must be agreed to by myself forth...

51:19.901 --> 51:21.372
Move!

51:23.821 --> 51:28.911
Dexter. How lovely of you to join us.

51:28.993 --> 51:31.758
I had to take one of mine to the hospital.

51:34.040 --> 51:37.006
But don't worry.
What I got to say won't take long.

51:37.085 --> 51:38.556
Oh, good.

51:38.628 --> 51:42.010
Now there's over 4,000 Germans booked in
for Europe this summer.

51:42.424 --> 51:46.600
And they're gonna steamroller us unless
all our firms go together.

51:46.678 --> 51:47.852
With me as top boy.

51:48.180 --> 51:50.267
Testing.

51:50.390 --> 51:53.273
- One, two. One, two.
- Now in the past,

51:53.393 --> 51:56.608
our firm has rumbled
every single one of you lot.

51:58.231 --> 52:02.740
So I suggest it's me that leads the charge.

52:03.445 --> 52:06.293
One minute, mate. Who the fuck are you?

52:09.576 --> 52:10.751
I'm Dex.

52:10.828 --> 52:12.334
Weetadex more like.

52:14.331 --> 52:16.171
That's quite funny actually.

52:16.250 --> 52:17.638
What firm are you anyway?

52:17.710 --> 52:20.094
The Village People,
by the look of that moody tash.

52:21.088 --> 52:24.267
Have you not heard? The 1980s called.
They want their clobber back.

52:27.803 --> 52:30.271
Go on, mate, take no notice of them.

52:30.348 --> 52:31.854
Which outfit are you?

52:33.726 --> 52:36.027
- The Hooligan Factory.
- Yeah.

52:36.103 --> 52:37.147
The who?

52:37.230 --> 52:38.986
- Anybody read that one?
- Nah!

52:40.942 --> 52:44.406
Go on then, Magnum, P.I.
What's your book called?

52:46.906 --> 52:48.460
I don't have a book.

52:48.533 --> 52:51.879
You want to take us on tour
and you don't even have a book?

52:53.288 --> 52:57.049
You don't have a book? You mug.

53:03.340 --> 53:04.893
What a mug!

53:16.103 --> 53:19.033
Hey, you fucking crappy ugly bastard.

53:19.106 --> 53:20.696
Go on, fuck off.

53:21.149 --> 53:23.368
Dex. Dex, mate.

53:23.443 --> 53:25.780
Why are you following me for, eh?

53:25.863 --> 53:28.828
Didn't you hear 'em in there?
I'm a nobody. A fucking has-been.

53:28.907 --> 53:32.751
You're just a fucking kid.
Go home, Dan. Just fucking go home.

55:27.737 --> 55:29.374
Oi, Danny, mate.

55:30.907 --> 55:33.457
You get lost on your way to your penthouse,
did ya?

55:33.535 --> 55:35.291
You lemony fucking mug.

55:36.746 --> 55:38.419
No, fuck this.

55:38.498 --> 55:40.301
Yeah, jog on, you melt.

55:55.974 --> 55:58.311
Babe. What's the matter?

56:01.647 --> 56:03.533
You think I'm all right, don't ya, babe?

56:04.817 --> 56:06.407
You're the bollocks.

56:07.319 --> 56:08.707
You think?

56:09.613 --> 56:12.579
Of course, I do, you silly sod.

56:12.658 --> 56:18.257
You're a double hard bastard.
Always have been, always will be.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.764
Now come on, get up.
There's someone here to see ya.

56:35.515 --> 56:36.689
- Dex.
- Look, Dan, mate...

56:38.101 --> 56:40.022
You came here, you should go first.

56:41.646 --> 56:44.659
Look, mate, I just wanted to say sorry.

56:46.109 --> 56:47.283
Me, too.

56:48.403 --> 56:51.416
I shouldn't have gone off on you like that.
It was bang out of order.

56:52.741 --> 56:56.454
Sweet. Let's forget about it then.
Water under the bridge.

56:57.620 --> 56:59.590
So what do we do now, then?

57:00.206 --> 57:02.627
It's just I've never really apologised
for anything before.

57:04.377 --> 57:05.968
You know, we could hug.

57:06.671 --> 57:07.763
Hmm.

57:10.717 --> 57:14.265
Yeah. Yeah, we could do that.

57:28.485 --> 57:30.822
- I've missed ya.
- I've missed ya, too, mate.

57:30.904 --> 57:32.542
Yeah, that's my boy.

57:34.992 --> 57:36.914
That's a good boy.

57:38.037 --> 57:40.208
That's a good boy.

57:41.707 --> 57:44.092
- That's a good boy.
- Erm...

57:46.879 --> 57:49.050
That's good. Good boy.

57:49.131 --> 57:50.259
Oh!

57:51.425 --> 57:54.011
You're fucking killing me, you pair of melts.

57:55.304 --> 57:56.396
God.

58:04.439 --> 58:06.859
Dex, you still want to get back on top?

58:07.650 --> 58:09.287
More than anything.

58:09.360 --> 58:11.033
Good. Because I've got a plan.

58:11.696 --> 58:13.369
- Let's kit you out.
- Sweet.

58:13.448 --> 58:15.667
- Nah. That's muck.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:16.868 --> 58:18.707
I mean, it ain't normally my usual thing.

58:18.787 --> 58:21.207
All right. You don't like it,
you don't like it. Not a problem, mate.

58:21.289 --> 58:24.172
Now this.
That's proper fucking bit of garment, mate.

58:24.251 --> 58:27.715
No. You know what, mate?
I've got an idea.

58:28.922 --> 58:29.966
Oh, God.

58:37.848 --> 58:39.319
You mug.

58:51.320 --> 58:53.574
- Danny!
- Yeah.

58:55.658 --> 58:58.042
My plan was as simple
as it was brilliant.

58:58.119 --> 59:02.758
We'd get back on top the old-fashioned way.
By taking a fight to them. One firm at a time.

59:02.832 --> 59:05.051
But travelling around the country
don't come cheap

59:05.126 --> 59:08.305
and no bank was gonna lend us money
to kick the fuck out of someone.

59:08.379 --> 59:10.099
Soto put a bit of extra cash our way

59:10.172 --> 59:13.803
we all started working the door at one of
London's roughest clubs, the Bear Pit.

59:14.927 --> 59:17.431
Get out of the club,
you little dollop of shit.

59:18.765 --> 59:22.111
Fuck you lot. This club's a fucking shithole.

59:22.185 --> 59:25.115
I'm gonna get my guys,
come back and fucking screw you.

59:25.188 --> 59:27.608
Shut up!

59:28.399 --> 59:30.784
Welcome to the fucking neighbourhood!

59:30.860 --> 59:32.616
Hey, sluts, what's happening?

59:33.863 --> 59:36.746
Needless to say,
we took to it like ducks to water.

59:36.825 --> 59:40.705
£10? £10? You fucking rip off.

59:40.787 --> 59:43.291
Yeah. That's right.

59:43.373 --> 59:45.461
Within a week
we had the place on Iockdown.

59:45.542 --> 59:47.843
No more gangsters, no more drug dealers.

59:47.919 --> 59:49.011
Thank you, sir.

59:49.087 --> 59:50.594
But there was only one problem.

59:50.672 --> 59:52.558
What an absolutely charming venue.

59:53.967 --> 59:56.055
For some reason
the punters just stopped coming

59:57.429 --> 59:59.648
And the work dried up.

01:00:00.724 --> 01:00:04.106
But we soon found out running doors
weren't the only way to make money.

01:00:06.271 --> 01:00:10.911
There's more than one use for hired muscle.
Guarding packages, minding drug deals.

01:00:10.985 --> 01:00:12.906
Where's all the cocaine?

01:00:12.987 --> 01:00:16.249
Me and the lads got paid to make sure
things went down how they should.

01:00:18.242 --> 01:00:22.335
Go on, Weas, she fucking loves it, man,
like a fucking Hoover, yes, mate!

01:00:22.413 --> 01:00:26.091
Well, no one minds laying out
an extra 10% for peace of mind.

01:00:26.417 --> 01:00:29.098
And soon
people started to come to us for all sorts.

01:00:30.796 --> 01:00:33.596
So what the fuck are we doing out here?
What do you want from us?

01:00:33.674 --> 01:00:34.718
Well, basically, mates,

01:00:34.801 --> 01:00:38.681
what it is, we're just looking for
someone to keep an eye on things.

01:00:38.763 --> 01:00:40.982
Keep out the wrong element,
if you know what I mean.

01:00:41.057 --> 01:00:42.528
Good job you called us then.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.440
'Cause cracking heads is what we do best,
innit, boys?

01:00:44.519 --> 01:00:45.611
Yeah.

01:00:45.687 --> 01:00:47.240
No, Mr Dex, you misunderstand.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.363
Charles and I abhor violence.

01:00:50.442 --> 01:00:52.862
What we're trying to create here
is an environment of love.

01:00:53.319 --> 01:00:56.783
An environment where people from
all walks of life can come together,

01:00:57.282 --> 01:01:02.965
and dance, and sing and love,
free from the shackles of oppression.

01:01:03.038 --> 01:01:04.129
Mmm.

01:01:04.456 --> 01:01:06.295
Poofs night, is it, then?

01:01:06.374 --> 01:01:08.130
No, Mr Dex.

01:01:11.672 --> 01:01:13.593
What's that? Drugs?

01:01:13.674 --> 01:01:17.268
This isn't drugs, darling. This is pure love.

01:01:22.015 --> 01:01:24.601
I love you, man! I love you, man!

01:01:25.185 --> 01:01:27.950
Fuck off! Back off, all right?

01:01:31.483 --> 01:01:35.446
- Guys, why are you so angry?
- Step back. You're encroaching.

01:02:03.725 --> 01:02:05.231
You all right, lads?

01:02:05.727 --> 01:02:08.028
We've only gone
and taken one of them pills, ain't we?

01:02:08.104 --> 01:02:09.278
How is it?

01:02:09.355 --> 01:02:11.657
Fucking shit. Don't do nothing.

01:02:11.775 --> 01:02:12.866
Two-bob.

01:02:13.693 --> 01:02:17.490
Right, Midnight, give me another one.
Mine must be a dud an' all.

01:02:33.547 --> 01:02:35.516
These pills are fucking rubbish,
ain't they, mate?

01:02:35.591 --> 01:02:37.062
Fucking shit.

01:02:41.138 --> 01:02:42.977
We've known each other a long time,
ain't we, Midnight?

01:02:43.056 --> 01:02:45.525
Yeah, mate. A long time.

01:02:49.897 --> 01:02:51.902
You're like a fucking brother to me.

01:02:51.982 --> 01:02:55.411
I was just thinking the same thing.
We're like brothers.

01:02:58.906 --> 01:03:00.828
Oh, fuck me, I love ya.

01:03:00.908 --> 01:03:02.830
I fucking love ya an' all.

01:03:38.863 --> 01:03:40.370
What the fuck are they doing?

01:03:45.287 --> 01:03:48.300
Yeah!

01:03:52.169 --> 01:03:53.212
Oi...

01:03:53.295 --> 01:03:56.474
What have they been taking? Tablets.

01:03:56.548 --> 01:03:57.972
We were on our way.

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:00.389
Right, let's have ya.

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:01.726
With the money we made
from being doormen

01:04:01.804 --> 01:04:04.058
we had more than enough to pay for
a shitload of those happy pills

01:04:04.139 --> 01:04:06.394
and we sold 'em at raves
up and down the country.

01:04:06.475 --> 01:04:08.860
It was the easiest money we ever made.

01:04:16.402 --> 01:04:18.407
We hired a bus and a shitload of extras

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:21.869
and began to tour England
tearing up the firms one by one.

01:04:21.949 --> 01:04:23.835
But I still had one problem.

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:25.787
Bullet!

01:04:26.078 --> 01:04:28.084
- All right, Dex.
- What?

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:31.343
Oh, I'm sorry, Dan.
Can't tell the two of you apart nowadays.

01:04:31.751 --> 01:04:34.966
Funny. I remember when we first met.

01:04:35.046 --> 01:04:38.510
You remember that, don't ya, lunch?

01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:41.472
Let me fill you in.

01:04:41.552 --> 01:04:43.106
You might dress like Dexy,

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:46.940
but the only reason you're here is because
you remind him of his dead son.

01:04:48.601 --> 01:04:53.358
In case you're wondering.
That's me there. Right at the top.

01:04:54.899 --> 01:04:56.987
And it ain't alphabetical.

01:05:27.182 --> 01:05:31.939
You fucking sod.
It's fucking on now! Fuck this...

01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:36.402
Have that, you fucking mug.

01:05:40.237 --> 01:05:42.492
Fucking broke my glasses.

01:05:54.544 --> 01:05:56.845
What the fuck was that for?

01:05:56.921 --> 01:05:58.926
He's a bit keen, isn't he, Dex?

01:05:59.674 --> 01:06:00.766
He's new.

01:06:00.842 --> 01:06:06.097
He's mental.
Oi, this is supposed to be the verbals, son.

01:06:06.598 --> 01:06:09.611
You can't just go round hitting people.

01:06:10.226 --> 01:06:12.777
- I'm sorry.
- Don't say sorry to me.

01:06:13.605 --> 01:06:15.692
It's him whose glasses you broke.

01:06:16.358 --> 01:06:17.864
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

01:06:18.193 --> 01:06:19.285
- You all right?
- It's all right.

01:06:19.361 --> 01:06:20.404
- Sure?
- Yeah.

01:06:20.487 --> 01:06:23.951
All right. Now where were we?

01:06:24.032 --> 01:06:25.455
Oh, yeah. Come on then!

01:06:26.952 --> 01:06:28.293
It's fucking on!

01:07:05.658 --> 01:07:08.458
Right. Step back. Come on.

01:07:09.745 --> 01:07:11.383
Nothing to see. All over.

01:07:27.806 --> 01:07:29.692
God! What is going on?

01:07:48.702 --> 01:07:51.632
You flash, cockney bastards.
You know Stanley?

01:07:51.705 --> 01:07:53.259
Nah, mate.

01:07:53.749 --> 01:07:56.003
Do you know my little friend Makita?

01:08:50.974 --> 01:08:52.694
Fucking hell, boys.
What's the matter with ya?

01:08:52.767 --> 01:08:53.859
I'm sorry, Dex, mate.

01:10:18.939 --> 01:10:21.323
Call yourselves hooligans?

01:10:21.399 --> 01:10:23.286
They've done the lot of ya.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:28.877
And you, Farmer,
your lot were a fucking embarrassment.

01:10:28.949 --> 01:10:32.377
You're supposed to be
one of the top firms in the country.

01:10:32.452 --> 01:10:37.341
And you let yourself get turned over
by a fucking has-been.

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:44.975
He told me to give you this.

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:53.277
"You have been steamrollered by the..."
Fucking...

01:11:19.459 --> 01:11:21.096
What are you gonna do with that?

01:11:22.253 --> 01:11:25.018
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:27.512
You can't bring a gun to a ruck.

01:11:27.592 --> 01:11:29.146
Says who?

01:11:30.637 --> 01:11:32.856
Just can't. It's not cricket.

01:11:32.931 --> 01:11:36.941
Fuck cricket! This is football!

01:11:43.525 --> 01:11:47.452
I can't believe we did it. We got the top firm.

01:11:47.946 --> 01:11:50.532
When I go down to the shops
I get straight in at the front of the queue.

01:11:50.616 --> 01:11:53.166
Pop down the boozer,
people are buying me drinks.

01:11:53.243 --> 01:11:56.292
Feel like a legend. Like me old man.

01:11:57.664 --> 01:12:00.049
Yeah, well, we're not the top firm yet.

01:12:03.837 --> 01:12:04.881
All right, mate.

01:12:04.963 --> 01:12:07.432
Ah, Midnight,
you want to come in or something?

01:12:08.133 --> 01:12:09.936
No, I'm sound, bruv.

01:12:10.803 --> 01:12:11.895
Uh...

01:12:12.221 --> 01:12:13.728
Listen, Dex, erm,

01:12:14.974 --> 01:12:16.646
I can't come to the final ruck.

01:12:17.643 --> 01:12:21.523
- What you talking about?
- I'm looking to get out. Going straight.

01:12:21.856 --> 01:12:24.406
Got a geezer who said
he'll sort me out with a job.

01:12:24.483 --> 01:12:27.201
A proper job. Not a florist.

01:12:28.321 --> 01:12:31.583
Dex, I got a kid to support.

01:12:32.784 --> 01:12:33.994
No, you don't.

01:12:35.328 --> 01:12:38.258
No. You're right.

01:12:39.707 --> 01:12:41.000
I don't.

01:12:42.043 --> 01:12:43.680
It's just,

01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:47.600
-ever since that night at the rave...
- Oh, I knew it. I knew it.

01:12:47.674 --> 01:12:50.260
I can't even look you in the eye no more.

01:12:51.469 --> 01:12:53.356
And me heart's not in it.

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.192
Midnight, they need ya.

01:12:58.351 --> 01:13:00.107
- I need ya.

01:13:00.187 --> 01:13:01.314
I'm sorry, mate.

01:13:02.272 --> 01:13:05.535
Midnight! Midnight!

01:13:06.193 --> 01:13:07.534
Midnight.

01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:09.909
Dex, mate, it's the phone.
It's important.

01:13:14.243 --> 01:13:15.453
It's The Baron.

01:13:18.664 --> 01:13:21.298
- Baron!
- Hello, Dexter.

01:13:21.375 --> 01:13:24.922
I do hope
I'm not calling at an inconvenient time.

01:13:25.004 --> 01:13:27.091
Shut it, Baron.
Give me the where and the when.

01:13:29.717 --> 01:13:32.101
3:00 p.m. kick-off.

01:13:32.511 --> 01:13:35.726
- Where?
- Well, call me sentimental and all that,

01:13:35.973 --> 01:13:38.607
but one place does spring to mind.

01:13:39.101 --> 01:13:40.359
I think you know where.

01:13:42.813 --> 01:13:44.783
Dad!

01:13:45.816 --> 01:13:47.288
Yeah.

01:13:48.361 --> 01:13:49.452
I know.

01:13:53.741 --> 01:13:55.295
You okay, mate?

01:13:56.911 --> 01:13:59.841
Danny, I don't want you
coming to the final ruck.

01:13:59.914 --> 01:14:01.006
What do you mean?

01:14:03.918 --> 01:14:06.303
Look, you've done great so far.

01:14:06.421 --> 01:14:09.386
But this ain't Ipswich away.
These lot mean business.

01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:12.686
I thought I was part of something.

01:14:12.761 --> 01:14:14.267
And I thought you needed me.

01:14:14.346 --> 01:14:16.351
I do. More than you know.

01:14:16.431 --> 01:14:18.483
Well, then why are you
taking this away from me?

01:14:18.683 --> 01:14:22.361
Look, Dan, I've already lost one son.
I am not losing another.

01:14:22.437 --> 01:14:24.277
I'm not your son, Dex.

01:14:27.067 --> 01:14:30.080
- Danny.
- No, mate. I'm me own man.

01:14:31.989 --> 01:14:33.460
You're just a kid.

01:14:37.411 --> 01:14:39.748
Well, fuck you, Dex.

01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:41.800
You wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for me.

01:14:47.129 --> 01:14:48.636
Danny.

01:15:13.031 --> 01:15:14.537
It's quiet.

01:15:15.325 --> 01:15:18.788
- It's almost too quiet.
- Maybe they've bottled it.

01:15:39.432 --> 01:15:42.731
Something all too familiar about this,
eh, Dexter?

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.070
And I see you brought another boy with ya.

01:15:46.356 --> 01:15:49.074
Ain't you learnt nothing from the last time?

01:15:49.151 --> 01:15:51.370
What are you doing here, Dan?
I told you not to come.

01:15:51.445 --> 01:15:56.036
Fuck off, Baron, you kimono-wearing clown
I'll open you up like a tin of beans.

01:15:58.327 --> 01:16:00.877
He's got some stones on him, your boy,
I'll give him that.

01:16:01.955 --> 01:16:05.503
Well, you listen to me, boy.
As soon as I'm done with the old man,

01:16:05.918 --> 01:16:08.137
I'm coming for you, you fucking pinhead.

01:16:08.254 --> 01:16:09.807
You'll have to go through me first.

01:16:12.675 --> 01:16:14.063
Fuck it.

01:16:14.135 --> 01:16:16.021
You never back down, do you, boy?

01:16:16.387 --> 01:16:18.724
No. I always stand me ground.

01:16:19.724 --> 01:16:23.864
Oh, it's all very touching, Dexter.
So, any last words?

01:16:23.936 --> 01:16:26.736
I'm sick of talking, Baron.

01:16:28.024 --> 01:16:30.325
Let's do this. Come on!

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:24.873
Thanks, Dan.

01:17:24.957 --> 01:17:26.214
Next, I'll finish you!

01:17:26.292 --> 01:17:28.972
Don't start that, young man.

01:18:01.035 --> 01:18:03.504
Move! Move!

01:18:06.332 --> 01:18:09.013
Move! Dexter!

01:18:25.394 --> 01:18:29.024
You think you're a god.
A great god of vengeance.

01:18:29.106 --> 01:18:32.618
You're nothing, you porky slut.

01:18:33.694 --> 01:18:37.656
And now it's time for you to join your son.

01:18:50.044 --> 01:18:51.385
Fuck me!

01:18:52.087 --> 01:18:53.345
Dex.

01:18:54.882 --> 01:18:56.436
Midnight.

01:18:58.469 --> 01:18:59.680
Dex!

01:18:59.762 --> 01:19:01.269
Midnight!

01:19:04.183 --> 01:19:07.814
Come on,
let's have ya, ya wankers.

01:19:20.617 --> 01:19:22.419
This is for the Factory.

01:19:23.912 --> 01:19:25.751
This is from me.

01:19:28.583 --> 01:19:31.881
And this is for my son.

01:19:33.421 --> 01:19:34.632
Dex!

01:19:36.424 --> 01:19:39.639
Drop him out. He ain't worth it.

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:51.985
You've had a squeeze.

01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:02.063
Someone call an ambulance.

01:21:07.684 --> 01:21:08.811
Dex, mate.

01:21:10.604 --> 01:21:11.778
Dex.

01:21:14.691 --> 01:21:15.735
Midnight.

01:21:17.611 --> 01:21:21.372
- Look after little fucking Curtis for me.
- I will.

01:21:22.116 --> 01:21:25.829
- Like he was your own.
- Like he was my own.

01:21:27.621 --> 01:21:30.670
Boys, it's been emotional.

01:21:32.626 --> 01:21:35.889
Danny, come closer.

01:21:52.438 --> 01:21:54.360
You're the daddy now.

01:22:39.528 --> 01:22:42.660
So, which one of you
wants to tell us what happened?

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:45.670
Fuck you, cozzer. We ain't talking.

01:22:46.619 --> 01:22:47.876
Okay.

01:22:47.953 --> 01:22:51.714
Maybe you'll feel a bit more comfortable
speaking to an old friend.

01:22:51.791 --> 01:22:53.760
Bill, can you come in here, please?

01:22:57.421 --> 01:22:59.640
Allo, allo, allo, boys.

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:02.976
How does he know your name, Bill?

01:23:03.761 --> 01:23:06.691
Of course, they know his name.
He's a fucking face, ain't ya, Bill?

01:23:13.146 --> 01:23:14.320
Tell 'em, Bill.

01:23:16.983 --> 01:23:20.661
Bullet, I'm a police officer.

01:23:21.196 --> 01:23:23.117
You can't be.

01:23:23.656 --> 01:23:25.662
You fucking ain't, Old Bill.

01:23:27.952 --> 01:23:31.381
Danny, can you come with me, please?

01:23:32.624 --> 01:23:35.839
That's right. Going together.

01:23:37.254 --> 01:23:41.134
Solidarity! Don't tell 'em nothing, boys!

01:23:41.216 --> 01:23:44.847
Boys! Boys!

01:23:45.762 --> 01:23:51.231
Right. One of you's obviously grassed.
Which one is it?

01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:58.701
Dan, I'm sorry about what happened to Dex.
I know he meant a lot to ya.

01:23:58.776 --> 01:24:00.413
Thanks.

01:24:01.278 --> 01:24:02.999
Listen, Dan.

01:24:03.072 --> 01:24:06.002
I know you're not stupid,
so I'm gonna tell this to you straight.

01:24:06.075 --> 01:24:09.373
It's not you I'm after. It's that lot in there.

01:24:10.037 --> 01:24:11.129
Okay.

01:24:11.789 --> 01:24:14.043
So consider this your lucky day.

01:24:14.125 --> 01:24:18.265
All charges against you have been dropped.
You're free to go.

01:24:19.547 --> 01:24:22.596
- Really?
- But if I even get a whiff

01:24:22.675 --> 01:24:25.226
that you've been in kind of trouble at all,

01:24:25.303 --> 01:24:28.400
I'm gonna come down on you like
a ton of bricks. Do you understand me?

01:24:35.313 --> 01:24:39.489
Dex's death, tragic though it was,
taught me one thing.

01:24:39.567 --> 01:24:43.578
Life's funny.
You can be up one minute and dead the next.

01:24:43.905 --> 01:24:48.128
But remember, if someone gives you
a second chance, always take it.

01:24:48.201 --> 01:24:50.253
Because you may not get another.

01:24:53.915 --> 01:24:55.422
Fuck you, cozzer.

01:24:57.252 --> 01:24:59.304
You little shit, Johnson.

01:24:59.504 --> 01:25:04.309
You're going down for the rest of your life
Wherever you go, I'll be waiting.

01:25:04.384 --> 01:25:06.603
I hope it was fucking worth it!

01:25:08.889 --> 01:25:10.609
Was it all worth it?

01:25:12.309 --> 01:25:14.397
'Course it fucking was.
