00:00.834 --> 00:03.737
*

00:13.447 --> 00:16.150
Hey.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.552
Is everything in here
onion-like,

00:18.586 --> 00:21.789
bacon-esque or cheese-ish?

00:26.827 --> 00:29.497
(clerk clears throat)

00:29.530 --> 00:31.465
Ever seen one
of these things before?

00:31.499 --> 00:33.067
Yeah, it's a TV, Pops.

00:33.101 --> 00:35.136
You can read all about it
on the Interwebs.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.737
Why read when I can watch?

00:40.141 --> 00:41.475
GIRL (sighs):
Lame.

00:41.509 --> 00:44.112
Have a nice night.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.046
(door opens, bell chimes)

00:57.525 --> 00:58.259
(door opens, bell chimes)

00:58.292 --> 00:59.360
MAN:
Nobody move! Nobody move!

00:59.393 --> 01:01.595
Nobody move!

01:01.629 --> 01:03.431
- Don't move, man. Don't move!
- Behind the counter-- go.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.665
Nobody here!

01:04.698 --> 01:06.600
Not the money;
the Change Your Life

01:06.634 --> 01:07.735
scratch-offs-- all of them!

01:07.768 --> 01:09.270
Lottery tickets? There. There.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.372
Watch him, man.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.274
(unzipping bag)

01:18.379 --> 01:20.681
Hey! Eyes forward!

01:20.714 --> 01:21.515
Damn it!

01:23.684 --> 01:25.886
Come on, man!
Keep it together, guys!

01:25.919 --> 01:27.755
Okay, okay! Hey.

01:27.788 --> 01:30.224
(gun cocking)
Gun!

01:30.258 --> 01:32.660
Come on! Come on!
(shotgun blasting)

01:32.693 --> 01:33.861
Oh, my God!

01:33.894 --> 01:34.795
Oh, my God, he shot...

01:34.828 --> 01:36.664
(shotgun blasting)

01:36.697 --> 01:38.799
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:38.832 --> 01:43.204
Let's go! Let's go!
(bell chimes)

01:45.773 --> 01:46.807
(dialing number)

01:46.840 --> 01:48.242
(phone line ringing)

01:48.276 --> 01:49.777
CLERK:
Yeah, I've been robbed.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.912
Yeah, I shot one of them.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.481
I think he's dead.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.716
Just hurry, okay?

01:55.749 --> 01:57.651
(crickets chirping)

01:58.819 --> 02:00.254
(door opens)

02:03.824 --> 02:05.393
"Grow a ponytail."

02:05.426 --> 02:07.361
(chuckles)
Yeah.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.397
I found an old wish list.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.465
Whose? Steven Seagal?

02:11.499 --> 02:12.600
(chuckles)

02:12.633 --> 02:13.867
No, I wrote this, uh...

02:13.901 --> 02:15.736
when I just got out of college.

02:15.769 --> 02:18.672
All the things I wanted
to do with my life.

02:18.706 --> 02:21.775
All the dreams and aspirations
of your father's youth,

02:21.809 --> 02:24.878
as scribbled on a flyer
for a Donovan concert.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.481
"See Easter Island."

02:27.515 --> 02:30.484
"Take a cooking class
at Cordon Bleu in Paris."

02:30.518 --> 02:31.619
Yeah.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.521
"Date Barbara Eden"?

02:33.554 --> 02:35.189
Genies were very hot back then.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.790
You know what's weird?

02:36.824 --> 02:38.959
That I wanted to learn
how to play the banjo?

02:38.992 --> 02:40.594
- What's not on the list.
- What?

02:40.628 --> 02:41.795
Own a vintage home.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.964
Play golf at Augusta.

02:43.997 --> 02:44.765
Have kids.

02:44.798 --> 02:45.899
Well, you know, priorities
change.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.868
I mean, when you're young,

02:47.901 --> 02:50.371
your, uh...
your life is about adventure

02:50.404 --> 02:51.772
and, uh, mystery,

02:51.805 --> 02:52.973
and if you're lucky, uh,...

02:53.006 --> 02:55.776
- Love?
- I was going to say sex.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.645
- That's a wish?
- Well, come on, I was only 21.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.380
I wasn't in a rush
to get married and have kids.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.982
Well, it's too bad
life doesn't follow lists.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.318
Ah, maybe not back then, but...

03:04.352 --> 03:06.620
I feel I have
a second chance now.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.257
Yeah, you're actually going
to do all those things?

03:09.290 --> 03:11.259
- Why not?
- Grow a ponytail?

03:11.292 --> 03:12.860
I'm working on it.

03:21.602 --> 03:22.970
You'd better be careful.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.838
You know, my girlfriend's
coming back from Portland.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.907
Yeah? She can have
you when I'm done.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.377
Hey, baby, come here.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.248
Let me look at you.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.616
I felt you were gone
forever, huh?

03:35.649 --> 03:37.385
Oh, me, too.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.988
So...?

03:42.623 --> 03:45.759
Trial just took longer
than we thought.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.027
Yeah, huh?

03:47.060 --> 03:50.731
Well, shouldn't we get
something to eat, maybe?

03:50.764 --> 03:52.800
I just want to get out
of these clothes

03:52.833 --> 03:54.668
- and have a warm bath.
- Yeah.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.770
I think I can help you
on both those counts.

03:56.804 --> 03:57.938
Yeah?
(phone rings)

03:57.971 --> 03:59.873
Oh, just...

04:01.542 --> 04:02.976
- I know that ring.
- All right, I think

04:03.010 --> 04:04.011
I just need an hour.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.446
Eppes.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.882
The water's getting cold.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.718
LIZ:
Four armed robbers stormed in,

04:10.751 --> 04:12.553
demanding lottery tickets.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.721
DON:
All right.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.556
- Take anything else?
- Nothing.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.291
Even left cash
in the register.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.392
Pulling the
surveillance tape.

04:18.426 --> 04:22.062
Clerk provided a description
of the getaway vehicle:

04:22.095 --> 04:23.331
cargo van, no plates.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.332
Any prints?

04:24.365 --> 04:25.566
These guys don't leave prints.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.767
How do you know that?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.069
The same crew
has hit eight other stores.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.339
Always after the same thing:
Change Your Life scratch-offs.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.773
Boyd Keene,
security supervisor

04:32.806 --> 04:33.974
for the California
Lottery Commission.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.409
KEENE:
Change Your Life is one

04:35.443 --> 04:37.645
of 52 scratch-off games
that the lottery

04:37.678 --> 04:39.012
is currently running
in the state.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.515
And the answer to your
next question is no.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.684
We have no idea why
they're targeting those tickets.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.420
They've targeted stores
in several jurisdictions,

04:46.454 --> 04:49.022
so the LAPD threw
the case to us.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.924
Clerk fired two rounds.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.460
12-gauge, double-ought buck.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.527
First one missed.

04:53.561 --> 04:54.528
Second one didn't.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.898
Whoa, you all right there?

04:57.931 --> 04:59.533
Lottery commission
doesn't deal with a lot

04:59.567 --> 05:01.001
of... violent crime.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.438
How about I.D.?

05:04.472 --> 05:05.573
It was Wayne Peterson.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.007
He had a record.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.076
Not the kind you think.

05:09.109 --> 05:12.380
He hit a $150,000 jackpot
last year.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.047
He's a lottery winner.

05:25.559 --> 05:29.497
Wayne Peterson, 47, single,
unemployed landscaper.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.600
Won 150 grand on the
Fantasy 5 draw last year

05:32.633 --> 05:33.601
from the California
State Lottery.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.602
Why would a lottery winner

05:34.635 --> 05:36.470
with no criminal record

05:36.504 --> 05:38.672
rob convenience stores
for lottery tickets?

05:38.706 --> 05:41.041
Peterson's landlord said he was
two months behind on rent.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.710
- Anything else?
- No, not much.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.379
As far as we can tell,
he has no family in the area.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.381
(sighs)
Someone's got to know the guy.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.549
NIKKI: Here's an idea--
you found this

05:48.582 --> 05:49.349
in Peterson's apartment?

05:49.383 --> 05:52.420
They hold
weekly support meetings

05:52.453 --> 05:53.587
for lottery winners.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.456
What, are you kidding me?

05:55.489 --> 05:56.690
Hey, bags of money are heavy.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.759
Trust me, life can get
pretty complicated

05:58.792 --> 06:00.994
the day you take home
a big lottery payout.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.596
Well, I could handle it.

06:02.630 --> 06:03.964
These scratch-off games--

06:03.997 --> 06:06.066
how big a part of the lottery
are they?

06:06.099 --> 06:11.071
The state lottery is a
$3-billion-a-year business.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.674
Scratch-offs account
for over half of that.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.075
It's the most popular game,

06:15.108 --> 06:16.544
and it has the best odds.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.745
Then, what happens when
the tickets are stolen?

06:17.778 --> 06:18.779
Well, the retailer reports

06:18.812 --> 06:21.415
the serial numbers
of the missing scratch-offs.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.884
If anyone tries to redeem one,
an alert goes out to the store

06:23.917 --> 06:25.118
where the ticket
is being redeemed

06:25.152 --> 06:26.720
and to the local authorities.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.689
So why steal scratch-offs
if they can't be cashed?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.991
Most tickets are taken
by store employees

06:31.024 --> 06:32.593
or shoplifted
without the clerk knowing.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.161
They aren't reported right away.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.997
It gives the thieves time
to cash in before the alert.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.099
So, it's the gunpoint
that doesn't make sense.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.201
Unless someone's figured out
a way to beat the system.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.636
We're bringing down

06:42.670 --> 06:44.738
an agent from
our law enforcement division.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.874
She's an expert
in lottery-related crime.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.510
You got lottery cops?

06:49.543 --> 06:50.544
(elevator bell dings)

06:50.578 --> 06:52.513
Can you hold the elevator,
please?

06:52.546 --> 06:53.514
Hold the elevator.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.148
- Thank you.
- No problem.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.450
(woman sighs)

06:58.586 --> 07:00.621
Sorry, I'm not
usually this frantic.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.623
Missed a flight earlier today.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.224
I'd be 0-for-two
if I missed the elevator.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.659
Look at it this way--
you're 50% on time.

07:05.693 --> 07:06.660
I'll take it.

07:06.694 --> 07:07.861
It's better than most airlines.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.597
Do you know that 63%
of commercial flights

07:09.630 --> 07:11.665
run at least 22 minutes
behind schedule?

07:11.699 --> 07:13.033
I base my airport arrival time
on those odds.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.201
Doesn't always work out,

07:14.234 --> 07:16.003
but, overall, it's
a real time saver.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.238
- That's an excellent analysis.
- You know, odds, they,

07:18.271 --> 07:19.372
they get a bad rap.

07:19.406 --> 07:22.075
Even the name "odds," it
suggests irregularity, you know?

07:22.109 --> 07:25.178
But numerically, actually,
odds are hyper-regular.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.814
You know a lot about numbers,
huh?

07:26.847 --> 07:28.616
Yeah, yeah.
Well, it's kind of my job.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.118
I'm also quite knowledgeable
about the fact that--

07:31.151 --> 07:33.721
I don't know, I think
that you are following me.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.556
(chuckles)

07:35.589 --> 07:37.024
Ah, well, perhaps we are
two hypotheses

07:37.057 --> 07:39.259
that share an empirical
consequence.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.662
- We're going to the same place.
- I think we are.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.698
- Dr. Charles Eppes!
- What are the odds?

07:45.966 --> 07:49.737
Robbery crew has stolen
nearly 10,000 tickets.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.805
These guys really want to get
their hands on some winners.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.140
The odds
of Change Your Life

07:53.173 --> 07:55.509
are one in 5.47, so...

07:55.543 --> 07:57.978
you know, you could win
with fewer than six tickets.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.748
Small payouts outnumber
the large ones in these games.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.783
Mostly they'd win
a dollar or five.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.518
DAVID: The amounts add up;
the value of the stolen

08:04.552 --> 08:06.554
tickets is over $125,000.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.055
The robbers haven't cashed
any of them.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.591
They will.
It's just a matter of time.

08:10.624 --> 08:13.727
And what's this shaded area
here?

08:13.761 --> 08:15.896
Uh, that is the predicted
target area

08:15.929 --> 08:17.230
of the next robbery,

08:17.264 --> 08:19.266
according to, uh,
my calculations.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.734
Your methodology?

08:20.768 --> 08:23.704
The order of the prior
locations of robberies.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.172
Fractional diffusion equations?

08:25.205 --> 08:27.274
Yes, from Professor
Dirk Brockmann's work

08:27.307 --> 08:28.876
with human mobility networks.

08:28.909 --> 08:32.012
- That's fascinating.
- Care to let us in on the fun?

08:32.045 --> 08:34.214
Yes, of course.
We're, uh, we're talking about

08:34.247 --> 08:35.816
the importance
of order or sequence

08:35.849 --> 08:38.285
in establishing
a specific pattern.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.021
So, think of these
robbery locations

08:41.054 --> 08:42.756
as keys on a piano.

08:42.790 --> 08:45.726
There are 88 keys.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.929
But even playing
one note at a time,

08:48.962 --> 08:51.599
more songs can be
composed on a piano

08:51.632 --> 08:54.001
than there are atoms
in the known universe.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.704
The key to knowing a specific
pattern or melody,

08:56.737 --> 08:58.772
is to know the order
in which to play the notes.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.107
(plays first four notes

09:00.140 --> 09:02.042
of Beethoven's "Symphony No. 5
in C Minor")

09:02.075 --> 09:04.344
If we know the order
of notes in a melody,

09:04.377 --> 09:05.846
we can take a good guess

09:05.879 --> 09:06.747
at the next note.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.582
And by using
the sequence of robberies

09:08.616 --> 09:09.883
as the starting point,

09:09.917 --> 09:11.118
I've been able to produce

09:11.151 --> 09:14.722
a defined target area
with a high probability

09:14.755 --> 09:16.023
of accuracy.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.891
Math in stereo.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.292
Yeah, the target
area's pretty big.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.728
How many lottery retailers

09:20.761 --> 09:21.962
are in it?

09:21.995 --> 09:23.797
Uh... uh, 67.

09:25.799 --> 09:26.834
CHARLIE:
I think I can be helpful

09:26.867 --> 09:30.237
to Agent Hackett in refining
the predictive area.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.839
All right, we'll stick
to some of that plain, old,

09:31.872 --> 09:33.040
non-mathematical FBI work.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.808
We'll focus on the
dead guy, Peterson.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.380
MAN:
"Everybody needs

09:40.413 --> 09:42.049
"money.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.984
That's why they call it money."

09:44.017 --> 09:46.353
David Mamet wrote that,
and it's true.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.656
And now that you have money,

09:48.689 --> 09:51.158
everyone around you will
suddenly need money.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.694
And they won't hesitate
to ask for it, because,

09:53.727 --> 09:55.829
well, you got lucky.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.165
You didn't earn it, did you?

09:58.198 --> 10:01.735
What you must remind yourself
is, you did earn it.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.938
You decided to play
the odds and you won.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.307
And the fact that you earned it
means it's up to you

10:07.340 --> 10:09.943
how wisely or unwisely

10:09.977 --> 10:12.045
you decide to use your money.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.847
Okay, next week,

10:13.881 --> 10:15.916
we'll get into some specifics
about long-term investments.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.818
Thank you. Thanks.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.989
- Scott Wilson?
- Yeah.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.392
Oh, you must be the FBI agent.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.928
I am. And this is
Agent Hackett

10:27.961 --> 10:29.196
from the state lottery.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.964
You look, uh, kind of familiar.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.833
I was at the ceremony
when they awarded you

10:32.866 --> 10:34.367
the $15 million two years ago.

10:34.401 --> 10:37.805
You won the Super Lotto
with the numbers

10:37.838 --> 10:40.908
2, 7, 19, 23, 41

10:40.941 --> 10:43.343
and, of course,
the Mega Number-- 13.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.245
How do you remember that?

10:45.278 --> 10:46.413
They're all prime numbers.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.815
I mean, that hasn't
happened since

10:47.848 --> 10:49.883
the Rhode Island Super Bucks
miracle of '98.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.953
Ah, this is my son Zack.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.287
Say "hello" to these agents.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.323
They're with the FBI

10:56.356 --> 10:57.958
and the lottery commission.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.927
What do the FBI care
about the lottery?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.962
What do you do--
you shoot minors

11:01.995 --> 11:03.430
who try to buy lotto tickets?

11:03.463 --> 11:04.865
Only if necessary.

11:04.898 --> 11:08.001
You know what you
should do is, uh,

11:08.035 --> 11:09.837
stop stupid people
from buying them.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.005
WILSON:
Zack, come on.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.006
Lighten up.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.976
Try not to miss me too much.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.946
My wife passed away
five years ago.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.113
When you're a teenager,

11:20.147 --> 11:23.083
all the money in the world
doesn't make your dad cool.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.918
Well, how can I help you?

11:24.952 --> 11:27.888
Do you know this man?

11:30.390 --> 11:32.860
This is Wayne.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.895
He was a member of our group.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.897
I-I heard about his death.
It's just bizarre.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.866
What can you tell us about him?

11:38.899 --> 11:39.833
He was the classic winner

11:39.867 --> 11:41.869
who would have been better off
not winning.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.336
Most of the people

11:43.370 --> 11:46.139
I counsel have never had access
to a large sum of money.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.909
They have no idea how
to make smart decisions with it.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.043
You help them gain
that knowledge?

11:50.077 --> 11:52.045
I try to educate winners

11:52.079 --> 11:53.413
on life after the lottery.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.283
How to spot a con,
dealing with jealousy,

11:56.316 --> 11:57.851
getting started
with estate planning.

11:57.885 --> 11:58.952
What was Peterson's story?

11:58.986 --> 12:01.521
By the time he got here,

12:01.554 --> 12:04.057
he'd quit his job,
gotten himself a Porsche

12:04.091 --> 12:06.193
and bought a diamond ring
for a stripper

12:06.226 --> 12:08.796
he'd met two days before.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.230
He was pretty mad at himself.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.032
He knew he'd blown it.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.500
How much did he have left?

12:13.533 --> 12:15.068
He said about $15,000.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.103
He knew it wouldn't last.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.438
I sent him
to a financial advisor,

12:18.471 --> 12:20.841
someone who specializes
in working with lottery winners.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.876
Yeah, well, we'll need a name.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.514
Sara Lewis?

12:27.547 --> 12:29.016
Hi.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.517
I'm Agent Warner, FBI.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.920
I just need a few minutes.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.788
If you don't mind
walking with me.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.089
I'm late for a lunch.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.124
Sure.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.458
I understand

12:38.491 --> 12:40.293
you were Wayne Peterson's
financial advisor?

12:40.327 --> 12:41.294
Not really.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.996
I met with him twice.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.331
By the second time, he'd already
lost most of his net worth.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.299
He must've been upset
about that.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.968
Very upset, very typical.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.337
A lot of lottery winners
have a hard time

12:50.370 --> 12:52.072
holding on to their capital.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.974
75% go broke within five years.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.476
Yeah, but most don't rob
convenience stores,

12:56.509 --> 12:57.978
looking for more
lottery tickets.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.012
That's true,

12:59.046 --> 13:00.413
but we're talking about somebody

13:00.447 --> 13:02.415
who thought
his life had changed forever.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.085
Couldn't accept that
he was worse off than before.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.054
Think it was too much
for him to handle?

13:07.087 --> 13:10.390
I think it would be a lot for me
or you to handle, much less

13:10.423 --> 13:12.893
an impulsive guy
who made poor choices.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.395
I don't think
he ever had a shot.

13:15.428 --> 13:18.265
We need to see Peterson's
financial records.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.834
Get a subpoena,
and they're all yours.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.836
I have a reputation
of discretion

13:22.870 --> 13:24.905
to uphold and a lunch to get to.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.010
Remember how your
mother used to hide

13:30.043 --> 13:31.344
a lottery ticket
in the present?

13:31.378 --> 13:33.113
She'd call it a gift in a gift.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.281
- That's right.
- Yeah.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.416
And she'd line us all up
at the table

13:36.449 --> 13:38.351
and make us scratch them
all off together.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.319
- Yeah, yeah.
- Right.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.454
Until you turned nine,
you refused to play.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.123
That's right.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.492
You told her the lottery is
"a voluntary tax on stupidity."

13:45.525 --> 13:46.759
- And I was right.
- Yeah.

13:46.793 --> 13:50.130
No. I mean, some of the money
goes to fund schools, you know,

13:50.163 --> 13:51.298
and support teachers.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.933
Well, that's the irony,
isn't it?

13:52.966 --> 13:54.367
That the money funds
schools that teach,

13:54.401 --> 13:55.535
among other subjects,
mathematics.

13:55.568 --> 13:56.603
But, uh, I don't know.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.338
Look, if more people understood
the probabilities,

13:58.371 --> 13:59.506
believe me, fewer would play.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.174
Well, you know,
people give more money

14:01.208 --> 14:02.575
when they expect something
in return.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.211
Yeah, but they're
buying into a game

14:04.244 --> 14:05.612
that's designed to
make them believe

14:05.645 --> 14:07.447
that the odds are
better than they are.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.415
Listen, the lottery asks you

14:08.448 --> 14:10.583
to pick six numbers
between 1 and 47, right?

14:10.617 --> 14:12.085
Yeah. Yeah.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.386
Well, that's the same
as asking you

14:13.420 --> 14:15.355
to pick a number
between one and 14 million.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.124
That's why you have
your lucky numbers.

14:17.157 --> 14:17.958
Oh, and what?

14:17.991 --> 14:19.426
Yours are your
families' birthdays?

14:19.459 --> 14:21.594
You think I'd tell that
to the lottery Grinch?

14:21.628 --> 14:23.363
Hey, listen, a professor
at UCLA analyzed

14:23.396 --> 14:24.998
20 million sets
of numbers played

14:25.032 --> 14:26.233
in the California Super Lotto.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.969
Among the most popular were one,
two, three, four, five, six.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.537
One, two, three,
four, five, six?

14:30.570 --> 14:33.106
The odds are the same as picking
any other set of numbers.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.474
1 in 14 million.

14:34.507 --> 14:35.943
Are you sensing a theme here?

14:35.976 --> 14:37.144
Yeah. The odds are against us.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.311
So what? They usually are.

14:38.345 --> 14:41.148
And do you know that roughly
half the people that play

14:41.181 --> 14:43.216
every week have a yearly
household income under $35,000?

14:43.250 --> 14:44.417
Yeah, so, most of the people

14:44.451 --> 14:46.053
who waste the most money
can least afford it.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.320
So what? I mean, it's
their choice, isn't it?

14:47.354 --> 14:49.422
If it wasn't the lottery,
it would be a casino

14:49.456 --> 14:50.657
or a bookie.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.459
This way, the money
goes for a good cause.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.961
Oh, got to go.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.095
It's a numbers game,

14:55.128 --> 14:58.131
and if you understand
the numbers, it ruins the game.

15:01.969 --> 15:05.005
Ran the list of names
from the lottery support group.

15:05.038 --> 15:08.041
No histories
of robbery or violence.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.410
Our bad guys get
zero points for style.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.645
You know, they're
sloppy, anxious.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.114
Don't know how to
handle weapons.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.215
DAVID: Seems weird.
Why pull robberies

15:15.248 --> 15:16.683
to get tickets that give you

15:16.716 --> 15:18.218
a chance at winning money?

15:18.251 --> 15:20.220
Robbing a bank is
much more direct.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.522
What would you do if you won
the lottery, Sinclair?

15:22.555 --> 15:25.325
Uh, well... (chuckles)

15:25.358 --> 15:27.494
I'd drive a nice car to work.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.661
What about you?

15:28.695 --> 15:32.332
Well, first off,
I'd buy you a nicer car.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.601
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.269
Then I'd make you drive me
to work.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.205
(phone ringing)

15:38.238 --> 15:40.707
(laughs)

15:40.740 --> 15:42.409
Sinclair.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.244
Yeah.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.112
LAPD found the van

15:45.145 --> 15:47.180
used in the robberies.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.686
LIZ: A security guard reported
a suspicious vehicle

15:53.720 --> 15:55.188
parked here overnight.

15:55.222 --> 15:56.623
LAPD called it in.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.291
DON:
Trace it?

15:58.325 --> 16:00.327
The VIN number led us
to a rental agency,

16:00.360 --> 16:03.196
but the customer used a
fake name and paid in cash.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.132
Anything in it?

16:05.165 --> 16:07.367
Just a little something.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.051
LIZ:
10,000 lottery tickets.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.586
All of them scratched off
and just left there.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.688
HACKETT:
Yeah, not quite all.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.058
We checked the serial numbers
of the recovered scratch-offs

16:31.091 --> 16:32.725
against the list of
the stolen tickets,

16:32.759 --> 16:35.662
and seven of the tickets
were not in the van.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.031
So you're saying, we're
just missing seven tickets?

16:38.065 --> 16:40.233
Yeah, all seven of
which were winners

16:40.267 --> 16:43.403
of amounts less than $600,
which is a significant number.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.504
Okay, why is that?

16:44.537 --> 16:45.472
A ticket under

16:45.505 --> 16:48.275
$600 can be redeemed
at any state retailer.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.443
Amounts larger than that
have to be claimed

16:50.477 --> 16:51.644
at a lottery field office.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.114
But these guys left behind a lot
of other winning tickets.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.682
Yeah, who pulls nine
robberies for seven tickets

16:55.715 --> 16:58.118
worth less than $4,200?

16:58.151 --> 17:00.420
And they put a lot of effort
into checking

17:00.453 --> 17:01.588
every one of those tickets.

17:01.621 --> 17:02.389
You ever scratch off
10,000 tickets?

17:02.422 --> 17:03.790
You know,
it takes a lot of time.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.625
Takes a lot of patience,
you know.

17:05.658 --> 17:08.528
Not to mention, you run the risk
of getting that, um,

17:08.561 --> 17:10.163
carpal tunnel syndrome.

17:10.197 --> 17:13.600
Which would make it hard
to shoot that gun, young lady.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.636
I feel like you could
work through the pain.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.338
How's that scratch-off
case coming along?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.773
- The AG's asking about it.
- Why is that?

17:20.807 --> 17:23.576
The lottery commission's
a high-profile state agency.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.245
Gets a lot of media attention.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.480
Well, I mean, we don't have

17:27.514 --> 17:28.848
very much yet, you know.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.850
Lotteries make for so
many legal headaches,

17:30.883 --> 17:32.719
including class action suits.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.222
People claim states
lie about the true odds,

17:35.255 --> 17:36.723
that they skim the winnings.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.658
Well, maybe they're just not
worth the trouble, you know.

17:38.691 --> 17:39.792
The lawyer in me agrees.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.362
The gambler in me would love

17:42.395 --> 17:44.164
to retire to a villa in Italy.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.432
Oh, yeah? Italy, huh?

17:45.465 --> 17:46.599
Yeah.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.567
Italy.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.702
Live off investments,
that kind of thing?

17:49.736 --> 17:52.439
Like that new motorcycle
that's parked in your spot.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.840
Oh, you saw that.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.542
Go for a ride?

17:55.575 --> 17:59.312
Gonna have to tell
me about it first.

17:59.346 --> 18:02.415
You'd be finer with a set of
fish tailpipes and some bullet

18:02.449 --> 18:04.584
- axle caps.
- Excuse me?

18:04.617 --> 18:05.818
Used to ride a bike in college.

18:05.852 --> 18:08.655
If I look around, I can probably
still find my leather pants.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.226
Look around.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.429
(door closes)

18:16.463 --> 18:19.599
Oh, now, what's all this?

18:19.632 --> 18:22.169
That conversation we had about
lotteries got me feeling lucky.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.804
Well, then it's clear I
failed to make my point.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.706
Well, there's nothing wrong
with believing in luck.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.308
Shakespeare did.

18:28.341 --> 18:32.479
"Fortune brings in some boats
that are not steered."

18:32.512 --> 18:34.747
And the other 14 million sink.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.849
If I'm gonna do any of those
things on my wish list,

18:36.883 --> 18:38.418
I'd better have a way
of paying for it.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.752
Still growing the ponytail?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.788
- I gave up that one.
- Oh, what a shame.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.890
I had a scrunchie all
picked out for you, Dad.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.525
There is something
you could get me.

18:45.558 --> 18:46.759
- What's that?
- It's new on my list.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.228
Grandkids.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.596
That's not new.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.930
I've been hearing about that
for years.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.031
Yeah?

18:52.064 --> 18:52.899
(scratching ticket)
How's your lottery case coming?

18:52.932 --> 18:54.801
I tweaked Agent Hackett's
analysis.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.237
I wasn't able to refine
a smaller target area.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.206
There doesn't seem
to be any importance

18:59.239 --> 19:00.740
to the order of the robberies.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.742
So, I think now

19:02.775 --> 19:04.711
we just wait, basically,

19:04.744 --> 19:06.746
for the bad guys
to make their next move.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.416
Waiting to get lucky, huh? Yeah.

19:09.449 --> 19:10.717
Maybe this will
change your luck.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.885
- Try one.
- Tsk.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.455
Uh, there's a part of this
you forgot to scratch off.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.856
Yeah, that's for
the serial number.

19:16.889 --> 19:19.359
Once you know
you're not a winner, why bother?

19:27.534 --> 19:31.338
The robbers weren't looking
for the winning tickets.

19:31.371 --> 19:34.407
They were looking for the
information on the tickets.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.946
CHARLIE:
All the tickets recovered

19:39.979 --> 19:42.349
from the robberies were
completely scratched off.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.950
The serial numbers were visible,

19:43.983 --> 19:45.752
even on the losers.

19:45.785 --> 19:46.919
Oh, my.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.921
Oh, my, what?

19:48.955 --> 19:50.590
Well, the serial number tells us

19:50.623 --> 19:51.724
if it's a winner.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.760
It's the most important piece
of data on the ticket.

19:53.793 --> 19:54.827
Oh, does the serial
number tell you

19:54.861 --> 19:56.929
- how much the ticket's worth?
- Yeah, but we use

19:56.963 --> 19:59.466
a computer-generated code
to randomize the relationship

19:59.499 --> 20:02.235
between the prize amounts
and the winning serial numbers.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.504
It would be almost
impossible for someone

20:04.537 --> 20:06.673
to make the connection without,
you know, cracking the code.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.940
Technology to generate

20:07.974 --> 20:10.477
truly random number sequences
doesn't exist

20:10.510 --> 20:11.911
yet, and until it does,

20:11.944 --> 20:14.647
all codes are vulnerable.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.983
Yeah, but to break our code,
you'd need to access

20:17.016 --> 20:18.818
an enormous amount
of information.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.820
Well, the robbers have
10,000 tickets,

20:20.853 --> 20:22.789
each with a serial
number and a prize,

20:22.822 --> 20:24.591
for a total of 20,000
data points.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.992
(sighs)

20:26.025 --> 20:27.927
Uh, yeah, you're right.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.531
I guess that's why you're
the famous math professor,

20:31.564 --> 20:33.966
and I'm the state employee.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.668
Oh, God, I can't
believe this whole time,

20:35.702 --> 20:37.470
I've been focusing on the fact
that the robbers

20:37.504 --> 20:38.705
are looking for winners.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.540
First off, you're
a fine mathematician.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.709
It's a lot easier
to explain this stuff to you

20:42.742 --> 20:43.876
than it will be to the FBI.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.846
The fact is that the robbers
did want winning tickets.

20:46.879 --> 20:47.947
Lots of them.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.916
If they break the code
that links the serial number

20:49.949 --> 20:51.984
to the value of each ticket,
then they can figure out

20:52.018 --> 20:53.820
which serial numbers
represent the big winners.

20:53.853 --> 20:54.654
Right?

20:54.687 --> 20:56.623
If that's what this case is
about,

20:56.656 --> 20:58.625
then we're not
the only two involved

20:58.658 --> 20:59.959
that know a lot about math.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.694
One of the robbers does, too.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.464
DON:
Okay. Yeah.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.598
Hey, we got a hit.

21:05.632 --> 21:06.866
Someone's trying to cash

21:06.899 --> 21:08.735
one of the seven
stolen tickets right now.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.503
Right now? Where?

21:10.537 --> 21:11.838
Venice at some mini-mart.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.373
We sent an alert
to the retailer.

21:13.406 --> 21:14.607
He's trying to stall
the suspect.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.576
I got Nikki and Liz
heading over there.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.945
Somebody tried to cash in
the stolen tickets?

21:18.978 --> 21:20.480
I mean, that doesn't
fit our theory that

21:20.513 --> 21:23.550
this case isn't about cashing
stolen tickets.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.485
No.
No, that doesn't fit at all.

21:25.518 --> 21:26.819
(siren wailing)

21:26.853 --> 21:27.987
Hey!

21:28.020 --> 21:29.322
WOMAN:
Hey!

21:29.356 --> 21:30.623
He's over here!

21:30.657 --> 21:31.924
That's him! That's him!

21:31.958 --> 21:33.092
- NIKKI: Stop!
- LIZ: I got the car!

21:33.125 --> 21:35.362
All right, he's heading
for the canal!

21:40.633 --> 21:42.335
(wheels screeching)

21:43.503 --> 21:44.837
(wheels clacking)

22:15.067 --> 22:17.770
(siren wailing,
brakes screeching)

22:18.805 --> 22:20.039
Freeze! FBI!

22:20.072 --> 22:21.073
Off the bike!

22:24.777 --> 22:27.380
Guess you can skip
your spinning class today.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.718
- Zack?
- Wait, you know this kid?

22:31.751 --> 22:33.052
Yeah, we used to date.

22:33.085 --> 22:35.121
His father runs
the lottery support group.

22:35.154 --> 22:36.823
(panting)

22:36.856 --> 22:39.025
Looks like we found
the seven missing tickets.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.627
Your father withhold
a few thousand

22:40.660 --> 22:41.961
from your allowance this week?

22:41.994 --> 22:44.397
My dad doesn't have enough money
to pay attention.

22:44.431 --> 22:45.565
He won $15 million.

22:45.598 --> 22:46.633
Now he's broke.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.710
ROBIN: Zack was in possession
of stolen lottery tickets.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.111
That links him to the robberies.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.481
He doesn't fit
the description of the gunmen.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.049
Well, then how'd he get his
hands on the scratch-offs?

23:03.082 --> 23:04.116
He says he found them.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.419
And he seems pretty
unconcerned.

23:06.453 --> 23:07.854
He doesn't seem to know
that they link him

23:07.887 --> 23:09.656
- to a serious crime.
- You think he's

23:09.689 --> 23:10.723
- putting on an act?
- I think

23:10.757 --> 23:13.192
he's got no idea what he got
himself mixed up in.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.795
And we pulled his father's
financial records.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.830
They confirm what Zack told us.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.799
- His dad is bankrupt.
- Well, Wilson knew Peterson,

23:19.832 --> 23:21.934
the robber that got shot.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.202
And Peterson was also broke,
right?

23:23.235 --> 23:24.771
Then maybe

23:24.804 --> 23:27.674
we're looking at a crew
of bankrupt lottery winners.

23:27.707 --> 23:28.875
The evidence is circumstantial,

23:28.908 --> 23:31.611
unless Zack tells us that he got
the tickets from his dad.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.780
He's 16. All right,
we need to notify

23:33.813 --> 23:35.815
his father that he's in custody.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.750
If Wilson is one of the robbers,
there's no way

23:37.784 --> 23:39.619
he's going to let us
talk to his son.

23:39.652 --> 23:40.853
Yeah, but the kid's
his weak spot.

23:40.887 --> 23:43.856
Maybe we can use that.

23:45.224 --> 23:47.159
(knocking)

23:47.193 --> 23:48.695
DAVID:
Scott Wilson!

23:48.728 --> 23:49.629
FBI!

23:49.662 --> 23:51.230
(music plays over
headphones, door opens)

23:51.263 --> 23:52.899
Mr. Wilson?

23:55.201 --> 23:57.704
Whoa! Whoa! Hey! Who are you?!

23:57.737 --> 24:00.607
FBI, Mr. Wilson. We knocked.
The door was open.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.075
(stammering): I was
expecting my son.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.076
Why are you in my house?

24:04.110 --> 24:05.778
Well, we're here about Zack.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.548
Oh, my God.

24:08.581 --> 24:09.749
Did something happen to him?

24:09.782 --> 24:11.484
He's in custody.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.219
Arrested?

24:13.252 --> 24:14.186
What did he do?

24:14.220 --> 24:17.123
We need you to come with us.

24:18.591 --> 24:20.226
We're still convinced
that the robbers

24:20.259 --> 24:21.794
are collecting data
from the tickets

24:21.828 --> 24:23.930
in order to crack
the lottery's code.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.264
How is that possible?

24:25.297 --> 24:26.699
(chuckling):
Professor Eppes said

24:26.733 --> 24:27.934
he would have a hard time

24:27.967 --> 24:29.068
explaining it to you.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.202
That's why he brought
a visual aid.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.271
All right, what we've
got here is a three-dimensional

24:32.304 --> 24:33.973
representation of the lottery's

24:34.006 --> 24:35.141
numerical relationship between

24:35.174 --> 24:36.543
the serial numbers
and the prize amounts.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.144
We've got 50 data points.

24:38.177 --> 24:41.280
Each one represents a serial
number of a stolen scratch-off.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.448
As you can see,

24:42.481 --> 24:44.851
- they appear to be random.
- HACKETT: With a limited

24:44.884 --> 24:46.018
amount of information,
it's impossible

24:46.052 --> 24:47.587
to determine the algorithm used

24:47.620 --> 24:49.155
- to encode the tickets.
- CHARLIE: However,

24:49.188 --> 24:51.290
our robbers have accumulated
10,000 serial numbers.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.926
Which is a lot, so now

24:53.960 --> 24:56.262
we get to see what happens...

24:56.295 --> 24:59.031
(rapid chirping)

24:59.065 --> 25:00.032
DON: All right, so that's
interesting.

25:00.066 --> 25:02.101
- So it's not random.
- Yeah, once you know

25:02.134 --> 25:03.169
the pattern,
you can crack the code.

25:03.202 --> 25:05.237
HACKETT: Now, our robbers
have enough information

25:05.271 --> 25:09.909
to identify the serial number
of the jackpot ticket.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.544
DON:
Which is how much?

25:11.578 --> 25:13.179
Five million.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.815
Uh, this seems a bit
far-fetched.

25:15.848 --> 25:19.852
Even if someone knows
the serial number,

25:19.886 --> 25:21.554
they don't know
where to find the ticket.

25:21.588 --> 25:23.055
There are over

25:23.089 --> 25:25.925
20,000 retailers in the state
that sell lottery tickets.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.860
It could be any of them.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.762
Besides, didn't you say

25:29.796 --> 25:31.698
that Peterson was a landscaper?

25:31.731 --> 25:33.232
An-And Wilson was
a truck salesman.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.634
KEENE: No way they have
the math skills

25:34.667 --> 25:35.568
- to pull this off.
- Well, I mean,

25:35.602 --> 25:36.869
they could be working
with someone else.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.137
Now it sounds like

25:38.170 --> 25:39.906
we're making assumptions
to fit a theory.

25:39.939 --> 25:42.575
He's got a pretty
good track record.

25:42.609 --> 25:43.876
Trust me.

25:45.177 --> 25:47.614
Hey. Got the dad?

25:47.647 --> 25:48.881
He's in the interview room.

25:48.915 --> 25:51.651
So I ran the financial records
on the lottery support group.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.285
- Uh-huh.
- Turns out Wilson and Peterson

25:53.319 --> 25:55.154
aren't the only ones
who lost all their money.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.123
Two other members
are also broke:

25:57.156 --> 25:59.125
Carl Graham and Raymond Brown.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.860
And they've both gone missing
since the last robbery.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.028
The innocent ones don't
tend to hide, right?

26:02.061 --> 26:04.330
Wilson's lawyer's here.

26:04.363 --> 26:05.832
She's demanding that the FBI

26:05.865 --> 26:07.166
stop talking to Zack.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.035
Officially, we have to do
what she's asking.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.102
Yeah, how about unofficially?

26:10.136 --> 26:12.138
Well, I'm not going to tell you

26:12.171 --> 26:15.675
to put father and son
in a room, but if you did,

26:15.708 --> 26:17.677
and if a conversation
took place,

26:17.710 --> 26:18.878
it would be
spontaneous utterance.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.279
A lot of "ifs."

26:25.685 --> 26:26.619
What is this?

26:26.653 --> 26:28.721
Well, he'd like to talk
to his dad before we

26:28.755 --> 26:30.122
- process him.
- We'd like some privacy.

26:30.156 --> 26:31.658
What's the big deal?

26:31.691 --> 26:33.626
I tried to cash in
some lottery tickets.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.628
Zack, what the hell
were you thinking?

26:35.662 --> 26:36.996
Scott, don't say anything.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.965
He's my son. I'm going
to talk to my own son.

26:40.667 --> 26:43.903
Dad, this is an intervention.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.004
(snickers)

26:48.140 --> 26:50.009
Stop spending money.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.845
For God's sake,
this is not a joke.

26:52.879 --> 26:54.180
Sure it is.

26:54.213 --> 26:55.782
Knock, knock. Who's there?

26:55.815 --> 26:59.251
The kid whose dad blew
through $15 million.

27:01.187 --> 27:03.690
It's a tough crowd.

27:03.723 --> 27:04.957
Everything I did was for us.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.993
- We're done here.
- DON: Mm, we're not done.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.427
The tickets we found on him

27:08.460 --> 27:10.096
implicate him in a series
of armed robberies.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.098
- Armed robberies?
- Nine felony counts.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.300
You're going to be
processed as an adult.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.006
I didn't even know!

27:21.373 --> 27:25.644
Dad? Dad, I didn't even know.

27:28.715 --> 27:31.784
He didn't rob anybody.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.221
I did.

27:35.254 --> 27:36.823
The tickets were mine.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.024
I hid them in a desk drawer,

27:38.057 --> 27:39.959
and my son must've found them.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.894
I mean, he's, he's a smart-ass,

27:41.928 --> 27:43.062
but he is not involved.

27:43.095 --> 27:45.765
Scott, don't do
anything you'll regret.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.199
What do you want?

27:47.233 --> 27:49.702
I'll talk if you drop
the charges against Zack.

27:49.736 --> 27:52.739
I want Carl Graham,
and I want Raymond Brown.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.874
(sighs)

27:56.408 --> 27:58.444
Peterson said he knew someone

27:58.477 --> 28:00.947
who had a way
to make us our money back.

28:00.980 --> 28:03.716
- DON: Who?
- I don't know.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.752
None of us did.

28:05.785 --> 28:06.986
We were each given

28:07.019 --> 28:09.822
a list--
which stores to rob and when.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.423
Ask Carl and Ray.

28:11.457 --> 28:12.725
They'll tell you the same thing.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.727
We can't find them.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.398
(exclaims)

28:19.431 --> 28:20.466
Idiots.

28:20.499 --> 28:23.369
They wanted to keep going
after Wayne got killed.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.172
I told them I wouldn't do it.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.407
I want to know the next store
that's going to be hit.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.142
(bell chimes)
Nobody move!

28:30.176 --> 28:32.144
Where's the clerk?

28:32.178 --> 28:33.312
(bell chimes)

28:33.345 --> 28:35.047
Just hurry! Get the tickets!

28:40.820 --> 28:42.321
Let's go! Let's go!

28:42.354 --> 28:43.823
I got them!

28:43.856 --> 28:45.191
(bell chimes,
police siren whoops)

28:45.224 --> 28:47.159
DAVID:
FBI! Don't move!

28:47.193 --> 28:48.260
Put your guns down!

28:48.294 --> 28:49.962
You got nowhere to go!
Drop it!

28:49.996 --> 28:51.097
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

28:51.130 --> 28:52.264
It's going down!
It's going down!

28:52.298 --> 28:53.766
It's going down!

28:55.467 --> 28:57.369
Stay right there.

28:57.403 --> 28:58.437
(garbled radio transmission)

28:59.906 --> 29:01.007
Mr. Raymond Brown.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.178
And Mr. Carl Graham.

29:13.986 --> 29:16.889
Graham and Brown both claim
they don't know any more

29:16.923 --> 29:19.125
than Wilson does; Peterson
was dealing with someone else.

29:19.158 --> 29:20.459
Kept the rest of them
in the dark.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.128
- So we've got nothing.
- We're looking into

29:22.161 --> 29:23.930
phone records, and techs
are searching his computer.

29:23.963 --> 29:25.497
KEENE:
Agent Eppes.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.937
The commission's
just informed me that

29:30.970 --> 29:32.872
we've uncovered highly
suspicious activity

29:32.905 --> 29:34.841
in our software
over the past few days.

29:34.874 --> 29:35.774
- Like what?
- Someone accessed

29:35.808 --> 29:38.344
information about
the robbery locations,

29:38.377 --> 29:39.812
before the robberies occurred.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.814
- What, like you were hacked?
- No.

29:41.848 --> 29:43.415
This person had clearance.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.584
CHARLIE:
That totally makes sense.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.354
The tickets, the code,
going after the jackpot...

29:48.387 --> 29:50.422
The facts are lining up
like lottery balls

29:50.456 --> 29:52.358
in a drawing machine.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.994
Mmm, I love the smell
of probabilities in the morning.

29:55.027 --> 29:56.295
(Charlie chuckles)

29:56.328 --> 29:58.297
Well, we... we still
don't know how the robbers

29:58.330 --> 29:59.899
plan on locating
the jackpot ticket

29:59.932 --> 30:01.834
once they'd exposed
its serial number.

30:01.868 --> 30:03.135
I mean, they'd need to know

30:03.169 --> 30:04.136
where each ticket was being
distributed, right?

30:04.170 --> 30:06.538
Right, and looking
at a ticket individually,

30:06.572 --> 30:08.908
there's no way to do that--
unless...

30:08.941 --> 30:11.310
- "Unless" what?
- Well, we've been

30:11.343 --> 30:12.879
analyzing these
tickets individually.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.447
Looking at them like points
on a graph.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.548
Is there another way
to analyze the tickets?

30:16.582 --> 30:17.917
In groups.

30:17.950 --> 30:19.451
The actual tickets
are packaged.

30:19.485 --> 30:22.421
They're... they're sent
to our retailers in batches.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.991
So, once they knew the serial
number of the jackpot ticket,

30:25.024 --> 30:26.325
they would then need to know

30:26.358 --> 30:28.327
where the batch containing it
would be sold.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.396
Right, but that's
restricted information.

30:30.429 --> 30:31.998
Only lottery employees

30:32.031 --> 30:34.533
with the highest
clearance level know that.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.202
They're working with an insider.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.938
- You think you know who it is?
- Well, there's only

30:38.971 --> 30:40.572
a couple dozen employees
that have that clearance.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.441
I mean, I know them all.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.043
I work with them.
I... I trust them.

30:44.076 --> 30:48.047
I did most of their
clearances myself, so...

30:48.080 --> 30:49.648
Nancy Hackett.

30:49.681 --> 30:50.883
Yeah.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.184
You're under arrest.

30:52.218 --> 30:53.185
What?

30:53.219 --> 30:54.653
No, this is a mistake.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.122
This is crazy!

30:56.155 --> 30:57.256
Boyd, you know me. Tell them.

30:57.289 --> 30:58.958
Nancy, please.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.893
You may want to see a lawyer

31:00.927 --> 31:03.062
- before you say something.
- What?!

31:03.095 --> 31:04.063
- Now, wait a second.
- I'm sorry,

31:04.096 --> 31:05.197
we would've notified you
earlier,

31:05.231 --> 31:07.133
but we had to move fast,
as soon as we figured it out.

31:07.166 --> 31:08.600
This isn't right.

31:08.634 --> 31:09.601
Why do you say that?

31:09.635 --> 31:11.370
Because she's been helping us.

31:11.403 --> 31:13.372
Because she just got done
telling me her theory

31:13.405 --> 31:14.941
about how someone inside
the commission was involved.

31:14.974 --> 31:17.276
Why would she do that
if it'd only lead back to her?

31:17.309 --> 31:18.911
Come on,
what's your evidence, guys?

31:18.945 --> 31:20.046
Hackett used

31:20.079 --> 31:22.648
her private password to access
the lottery software.

31:22.681 --> 31:25.384
Records show that she
researched the serial numbers

31:25.417 --> 31:28.921
of the scratch-offs and
locations before every robbery.

31:28.955 --> 31:30.122
She was feeding
the robbers information.

31:30.156 --> 31:31.991
No, there has to be
another explanation.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.993
Show me an equation
that proves it,

31:34.026 --> 31:34.994
and I'm with you.

31:35.027 --> 31:36.095
Otherwise, we've got

31:36.128 --> 31:37.263
a pretty clear case

31:37.296 --> 31:38.397
against Agent Nancy Hackett.

31:48.607 --> 31:51.277
So, Agent Hackett was telling
the robbers where to hit.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.412
A routine security review
of the lottery commission's

31:53.445 --> 31:55.514
software flagged her
unusual activity.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.549
Yeah, it looks like
she was searching

31:57.583 --> 31:59.551
for specific batch numbers
of tickets

31:59.585 --> 32:02.188
and then pinpointing
their location.

32:02.221 --> 32:04.090
This happened
right under my nose.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.125
I should've figured it out
sooner.

32:06.158 --> 32:08.227
What happens to her now?

32:08.260 --> 32:09.695
I'll oversee her transport

32:09.728 --> 32:11.430
back to Sacramento
to face charges.

32:11.463 --> 32:14.600
You know, I can't say that
we've never had an instance

32:14.633 --> 32:17.603
of employee fraud before,
but nothing like this.

32:17.636 --> 32:20.539
This is a real blow
to our department.

32:22.574 --> 32:25.077
ALAN:
I heard that, uh,

32:25.111 --> 32:26.445
Robin is back in town, huh?

32:26.478 --> 32:28.080
Yeah, I haven't had a minute,

32:28.114 --> 32:29.681
but I'm happy she's back.

32:29.715 --> 32:31.317
Well, did you at least
tell her that?

32:31.350 --> 32:33.485
Well, yeah, in so many words.

32:33.519 --> 32:35.321
Donnie, it's men like you

32:35.354 --> 32:38.624
that are the reason that BeyoncГ©
sings that "Single Ladies" song.

32:38.657 --> 32:41.260
- Did you just say BeyoncГ©?
- Yes, I did.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.095
- I'm up on current trends.
- Uh-huh.

32:43.129 --> 32:44.663
For instance,
did you know, that, uh,

32:44.696 --> 32:46.265
ponytails for men
are out of style?

32:47.399 --> 32:48.700
DON: Really.
(Alan chuckles)

32:50.102 --> 32:52.071
So, how's that
lottery case coming?

32:52.104 --> 32:54.140
Well, we closed it.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.075
- Hey, that's great!
- Yeah, except

32:56.108 --> 32:58.710
Charlie's gut says
we've got the wrong person.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.612
His gut, huh?

33:00.646 --> 33:03.649
You know, I read that intuition
is actually a skill

33:03.682 --> 33:07.019
gained by expertise
in a particular field.

33:07.053 --> 33:09.655
It's what happens when you, um,
subconsciously see something,

33:09.688 --> 33:12.558
even though you can't put your
finger on exactly what it is.

33:12.591 --> 33:15.027
And then you just fill in
the details later on.

33:15.061 --> 33:17.029
Charlie's not wrong a lot.

33:17.063 --> 33:19.231
- I'll give him that.
- Nope, he's not.

33:19.265 --> 33:22.234
- What's that, Easter Island?
- Yeah. (chuckles)

33:22.268 --> 33:23.669
I always wanted to go there.

33:23.702 --> 33:26.438
The problem is,
it's a 14-hour flight,

33:26.472 --> 33:28.707
and I just can't see myself
on the plane for 14 hours.

33:30.842 --> 33:33.079
Wait, that's it.

33:33.112 --> 33:34.346
- What?
- The case.

33:34.380 --> 33:37.149
What has Easter Island got to do

33:37.183 --> 33:38.650
with the
California State Lottery?

33:38.684 --> 33:40.286
No, it's not the island,
it's the plane flight.

33:53.099 --> 33:55.101
Open it.

33:55.134 --> 33:56.702
We pulled the lottery
commission's security report,

33:56.735 --> 33:58.737
dates and times that
Nancy Hackett logged in,

33:58.770 --> 34:01.407
using her private password.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.275
Okay.

34:03.309 --> 34:04.643
- What's going on?
- She was late.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.545
She missed her flight.

34:06.578 --> 34:07.813
I recall that, yes.

34:07.846 --> 34:08.914
The report shows her

34:08.947 --> 34:12.318
logging in from a hard line,
from a ground location,

34:12.351 --> 34:14.286
when she was 31,000 feet

34:14.320 --> 34:16.322
in the air,
en route to Los Angeles.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.457
She was in two places at once?

34:18.490 --> 34:21.793
I don't know, there must
be some explanation.

34:21.827 --> 34:22.828
Maybe the explanation is,

34:22.861 --> 34:24.196
Nancy Hackett wasn't

34:24.230 --> 34:25.297
the only one
using her private password.

34:25.331 --> 34:28.367
Well, of course she was.
Who else would be using it?

34:28.400 --> 34:30.269
- You.
- DAVID: You're the one

34:30.302 --> 34:32.238
that requested the commission
look into software logs.

34:32.271 --> 34:35.141
Because we suspected an insider.

34:35.174 --> 34:36.375
You asked for a review one day

34:36.408 --> 34:37.776
before Wilson tipped us off.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.278
DAVID:
You had access to data

34:39.311 --> 34:41.213
about where tickets were
being distributed.

34:41.247 --> 34:44.183
And your name is all over
Peterson's phone records.

34:48.487 --> 34:51.323
How does this work?

34:51.357 --> 34:53.225
What can I give you?

34:56.262 --> 34:58.264
We know
you're not trained in math,

34:58.297 --> 35:00.132
so you must be working
with someone who is.

35:00.166 --> 35:01.533
Someone who could
break the code.

35:01.567 --> 35:02.468
Who?

35:10.776 --> 35:13.379
I'd like another 32 tickets.

35:13.412 --> 35:14.513
You feeling lucky or something?

35:14.546 --> 35:15.681
Something like that.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.455
(bell chimes)
Ms. Lewis.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.424
Agent Warner.

35:58.457 --> 36:00.292
And friend.

36:00.326 --> 36:02.461
I actually don't have time
to talk right now.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.496
Why do guilty people
love to say that?

36:04.530 --> 36:05.897
I wouldn't know.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.566
- You win anything?
- You were the financial planner

36:07.599 --> 36:09.768
of four members
of a robbery crew.

36:09.801 --> 36:13.272
Not responsible
for what my clients do.

36:13.305 --> 36:14.840
Unless you help them do it.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.408
Your connections

36:16.442 --> 36:18.444
within the lottery support
group gave you access

36:18.477 --> 36:20.279
to men who were
desperate for money.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.613
Boyd Keene gave you up.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.815
Oh, that little bastard.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.351
(handcuffs tightening)
I spent years

36:25.384 --> 36:27.719
watching idiots
win and waste millions.

36:27.753 --> 36:30.922
People who didn't deserve
what they got handed to them.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.958
I mean, using the money
to upgrade

36:32.991 --> 36:35.361
your single-wide to a double,
who does that?

36:36.728 --> 36:37.963
One guy spent millions

36:37.996 --> 36:40.732
on a company who promised
him a light saber.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.601
Their money, their choice,
not yours.

36:45.471 --> 36:47.473
I hear bingo night's
popular in prison.

36:51.643 --> 36:54.413
Is, uh, is that the
five- million-dollar ticket

36:54.446 --> 36:55.947
- all this was about?
- LIZ: Yep.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.716
- That's the one.
- Pretty crazy, huh?

36:57.749 --> 36:58.950
Yeah, I guess.

36:58.984 --> 37:01.487
You know, there was a case
in Oregon in 2007.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.554
A woman used
a stolen credit card

37:02.588 --> 37:05.524
to purchase a scratch-off
worth a million dollars.

37:05.557 --> 37:06.592
- Did they catch her?
- Oh, yeah.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.494
She had the ticket on her
when they arrested her.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.595
NIKKI:
And what happened to it?

37:09.628 --> 37:10.296
Well, the judge ruled

37:10.329 --> 37:11.630
that the seizing authority was

37:11.663 --> 37:12.864
in possession
of the winning ticket.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.767
So, uh, they got to
keep the prize money.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.538
- I interviewed her.
- I held the scratch-off.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.708
Agents,
the arresting authority

37:22.741 --> 37:26.044
is the FBI, so...

37:26.077 --> 37:28.246
I'm just going to take this
on down to Evidence.

37:29.381 --> 37:30.516
You trust him?

37:30.549 --> 37:31.983
With $5 million?

37:32.017 --> 37:33.485
Hey! Wait! Hey!

37:37.723 --> 37:38.957
You know, being gone so long,

37:38.990 --> 37:41.393
I wasn't sure what
I was coming back to.

37:41.427 --> 37:44.530
Who? Me?

37:44.563 --> 37:47.499
You know, you're the guy
who's always on the job.

37:47.533 --> 37:49.301
One foot out the door.

37:49.335 --> 37:50.536
I got used to that.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.671
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
You're the one who left.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.340
I wasn't the one in Portland.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.007
What if long distance
works for us

37:56.041 --> 37:57.476
because it's safe?

37:58.810 --> 38:01.513
Because we like keeping
each other at a distance?

38:01.547 --> 38:04.583
How are we going to do this?

38:05.651 --> 38:08.554
(sighing):
We're doing it.

38:20.499 --> 38:21.933
ALAN:
How about that Bulgarian

38:21.967 --> 38:23.702
lottery last September?

38:23.735 --> 38:25.036
Where six winning
numbers were picked

38:25.070 --> 38:27.873
- in two consecutive drawings?
- Not that unusual.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.841
'Cause Bulgaria has numerous
lotteries, so the same six

38:29.875 --> 38:31.610
numbers in two
consecutive drawings...

38:31.643 --> 38:34.045
Actually, the odds are only
one in 5.2 million.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.447
Really?

38:35.481 --> 38:36.782
As many as a billion people

38:36.815 --> 38:38.049
play thousands of lotteries

38:38.083 --> 38:39.651
all around the world.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.853
Wild coincidences
are bound to happen.

38:41.887 --> 38:42.954
My-my favorite is

38:42.988 --> 38:44.790
one woman bought tickets

38:44.823 --> 38:46.492
for both the Massachusetts

38:46.525 --> 38:48.794
and the Rhode Island State
Lottery on the same day.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.696
She picked the winning
numbers in both,

38:50.729 --> 38:53.064
- but she didn't win a dime.
- Why?

38:53.098 --> 38:54.099
- What happened?
- Her Massachusetts

38:54.132 --> 38:55.434
numbers won in Rhode Island.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.468
Rhode Island numbers

38:56.502 --> 38:57.469
won in Massachusetts.

38:57.503 --> 38:58.804
- No! Oh, wow.
- Yes!

38:58.837 --> 39:00.572
Well, given enough
opportunities,

39:00.606 --> 39:03.542
- the improbable will occur.
- Well, in that case,

39:03.575 --> 39:05.977
Charlie, why don't you put
your money where your mouth is.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.078
There.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.547
(Hackett laughs)
- CHARLIE: Now, see.

39:08.580 --> 39:09.648
- Come on, come on.
- See, I knew

39:09.681 --> 39:11.583
this was coming.
Listen, if I do this,

39:11.617 --> 39:12.651
you have to promise me

39:12.684 --> 39:15.086
to stop trying
to get me to approve

39:15.120 --> 39:17.689
of playing the lottery as a
legitimate form of investment.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.491
Charlie, just think
of it as a bandage.

39:19.525 --> 39:21.593
- Just rip it off.
- Oh, boy.

39:32.838 --> 39:35.407
Are you feeling numerically
violated? (chuckles)

39:36.908 --> 39:39.678
I think I just won $10,000.

39:39.711 --> 39:40.746
(gasps)
Let me see that.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.049
I can't believe it.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.084
I mean, I-I... I can, but...

39:46.117 --> 39:48.820
$10,000. What are the odds?

39:48.854 --> 39:50.622
- I don't recognize this game.
- Wait a minute!

39:50.656 --> 39:52.424
That reminds me
of that father in Pasadena

39:52.458 --> 39:54.726
who bought
a fake scratch-off ticket

39:54.760 --> 39:58.764
online to play a prank
on his genius but gullible son.

39:58.797 --> 39:59.631
(both laughing)

39:59.665 --> 40:01.800
- Yeah, I remember that story.
- Mm.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.869
The father was never
heard from again.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.170
So, what are you going to do?

40:05.203 --> 40:07.606
Take me out with differential
geometry, huh?

40:07.639 --> 40:09.675
Protractors and slide
rules at 20 paces?

40:09.708 --> 40:10.676
HACKETT:
Sorry, Charlie,

40:10.709 --> 40:12.578
but the odds are
with your father on this one.

40:12.611 --> 40:14.079
ALAN (laughs):
It's just a joke,

40:14.112 --> 40:15.447
Charlie, just a joke.

40:15.481 --> 40:17.182
(Alan laughing)

40:50.882 --> 40:51.717
(gunshot)
