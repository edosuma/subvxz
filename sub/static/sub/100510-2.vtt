Tonight on First with Frist,

14:52.392 --> 14:55.812
Biff Simpson on the tragic
massacre of his family.

14:55.854 --> 15:00.025
It'll be the little things
I miss most.

15:00.066 --> 15:03.653
Eating Little Caesars pizza...

15:03.695 --> 15:06.156
watching Six Million Dollar Man,

15:06.197 --> 15:08.199
cuddled on the couch.

15:08.241 --> 15:12.412
Just telling 'em "I love you."

15:16.041 --> 15:18.376
I wish I could have done more.

15:20.587 --> 15:24.549
I wish it'd... it'd been me.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.679
But my Lottie always said...

15:32.349 --> 15:36.561
love means never having
to say you're sorry.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.406
This has been
a special presentation

15:48.448 --> 15:50.116
of First with Frist.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.827
And now back
to your regular programming,

15:52.869 --> 15:55.163
Me and the Chimp.

16:02.003 --> 16:04.297
You don't remember us, do you?

16:04.339 --> 16:06.883
I don't think so.

16:06.925 --> 16:09.511
My mother always said, "Murray,
you have a forgettable face."

16:09.552 --> 16:11.680
Ages five to eight,
she reintroduced herself

16:11.721 --> 16:13.098
every time she saw me.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.058
True story.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.644
Oh, well, you-you were

16:17.686 --> 16:22.315
just a yingeleh...
F-five or six years old.

16:22.357 --> 16:27.278
Your safta took you to meet us
at Art's Deli.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.322
- Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Remember that, Murray?

16:29.364 --> 16:33.243
Cute as a kugel you were.

16:33.284 --> 16:36.788
You looked just like him.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.541
Hey, got something.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.001
An SS roll from Buchenwald.

16:42.043 --> 16:45.296
Names a Nazi engineer,
Karl Holstedder.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.007
Buchenwald. Engineer.
10-4, Eleanor.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.261
Yeah.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.849
Karl Holstedder,

16:55.890 --> 17:00.019
the Pied Piper of Buchenwald.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.647
He was the emcee
of the Buchenwald camp.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.024
A brilliant radio engineer,

17:05.066 --> 17:07.694
he ran the camp's
control center.

17:07.736 --> 17:10.572
But on Saturday, Shabbos,

17:10.613 --> 17:13.491
he held his horror show,
The Star of Buchenwald.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.410
Good Evening, Buchenwald!

17:15.452 --> 17:16.786
Your master of ceremonies,

17:16.828 --> 17:19.164
Hauptsturmfuhrer Holstedder
here.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.332
Back for another episode of

17:21.374 --> 17:24.544
THE STAR OF BUCHENWALD!

17:35.972 --> 17:38.725
It was a singing competition.

17:38.767 --> 17:41.561
A sadistic Gong Show.

17:41.603 --> 17:46.524
Every Shabbos,
Holstedder rounded up ten men

17:46.566 --> 17:51.112
and made them sing
for their lives.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.829
If you sang out of tune...

17:59.871 --> 18:01.998
It's a D-flat,

18:02.040 --> 18:04.042
Number 218763.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.351
If you forgot the words...

18:21.392 --> 18:23.937
Come on, 217742:

18:25.980 --> 18:30.652
"In the Graceland
of our Fathers."

18:39.869 --> 18:42.789
Someone is
a quarter step ahead...

18:46.334 --> 18:49.087
Until there was only one left.

18:57.428 --> 19:02.016
Well, Mr. Holstedder...

19:02.058 --> 19:04.811
come on down.

19:11.192 --> 19:14.279
So, how do you like The Hunters?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.406
They scare the shit out of me.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.827
Yes!

19:20.869 --> 19:24.789
How'd you recruit 'em, anyway,
Professor X?

19:27.917 --> 19:30.295
No.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.716
Well...

19:36.134 --> 19:38.928
I went to a matchmaker.

19:38.970 --> 19:42.181
-♪ Matchmaker, matchmaker,
make me a match... ♪
-But that's not all she is.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.938
♪ Night after night,
in the dark I'm alone... ♪

19:48.980 --> 19:50.732
Yes, thank you.

19:50.773 --> 19:53.568
♪ Of my own. ♪

19:53.610 --> 19:56.237
Oh, my God.

19:56.279 --> 19:59.324
- Shalom, my dear love.
- I can't believe this.

19:59.365 --> 20:02.035
- Oh, I can't either.
- Mwah.

20:02.076 --> 20:05.121
- My darling.
- Come sit, Meyerleh, sit.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.582
Eh, what a neighborhood.

20:07.624 --> 20:09.250
I know. Very fancy.

20:09.292 --> 20:14.213
- It is fancy.
I'm so glad I dressed.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.049
30 years in our new shtetl
of Manhattan,

20:16.090 --> 20:20.219
you don't break fast with me,
you don't venture to my sukkah.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.806
What did a little old matchmaker
do to deserve such kavod?

20:23.848 --> 20:25.934
Well, I wasn't looking
to be matched, Hilda.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.227
So, if that's all right
with you...

20:28.269 --> 20:31.147
It's 40 years pining
only for Ruth.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.358
This is the oldest
"Will They or Won't They"

20:33.399 --> 20:35.568
in the world,
since-since Jacob and Rachel.

20:35.610 --> 20:36.986
Oh, God.

20:37.028 --> 20:41.449
You have a lot of security
for a little old matchmaker, no?

20:41.491 --> 20:45.161
Well, you know, can you think
of a creature more dangerous

20:45.203 --> 20:47.372
than a Jewish mother
with an unwed daughter?

20:49.874 --> 20:53.002
Matchmaker in the daylight.

20:53.044 --> 20:55.922
But don't sell yourself short,
because you've commodified

20:55.964 --> 20:58.800
the occupation of yenta.

20:58.841 --> 21:02.261
You weaponized the Rolodex.

21:02.303 --> 21:05.264
You are the Jewish world's
fixer, no?

21:05.306 --> 21:06.933
Hmm?

21:06.975 --> 21:09.310
So...

21:09.352 --> 21:12.313
if not for a bride,
or even a shtup,

21:12.355 --> 21:15.817
you know, one might ponder why
the gentleman from Park Avenue

21:15.858 --> 21:18.152
comes all this way to see me.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.905
Hmm? Cut to the liver, darling.

21:22.782 --> 21:27.036
Well... Ruth and I,

21:27.078 --> 21:29.914
we found something.

21:29.956 --> 21:33.209
Two Nazi doctors...

21:33.251 --> 21:37.505
living here among us.

21:37.547 --> 21:40.800
So, we need you, Hilda.

21:40.842 --> 21:45.388
I help you with this,
it makes noise.

21:45.430 --> 21:48.433
In my line of work,
noise is death.

21:52.520 --> 21:56.065
31 years since liberation.

21:56.107 --> 22:01.029
You know, in that time,
I have made 345 matches,

22:01.070 --> 22:05.074
producing 957 new Jewish souls.

22:05.116 --> 22:09.412
And, and seven more imas-to-be
are pregnant as we speak.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.833
It should be enough
for Hashem, Meyer.

22:20.381 --> 22:22.759
I suppose so, too,
comes the responsibility

22:22.800 --> 22:27.764
to make the world better
for these 957 lives.

22:30.266 --> 22:33.102
You say there are Nazis
among us?

22:34.353 --> 22:37.607
I suppose, then,
you are asking me for...

22:37.648 --> 22:39.942
A team.

22:39.984 --> 22:44.864
I need highly skilled.
Covert. See?

22:44.906 --> 22:46.157
This is no team, dear.

22:46.199 --> 22:47.492
- No.
- No?

22:47.533 --> 22:50.078
This is appointed by God.

22:50.119 --> 22:53.706
This is a, is a congregation.
A tribe.

22:53.748 --> 22:57.710
What you need is a group
who knows how to bend the rules.

22:57.752 --> 23:02.173
A collective who will take
justice into its own hands.

23:02.215 --> 23:05.009
Ragtag, just like,
like The Dirty Dozens.

23:07.845 --> 23:11.849
957.

23:11.891 --> 23:16.395
Hilda, if God does not
hear that,

23:16.437 --> 23:18.773
then He is deaf.

23:18.815 --> 23:21.692
957.

23:25.404 --> 23:29.367
It's still 5,999,043 short.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.618
Yes.

23:30.660 --> 23:34.038
But we have time yet, yeah?

23:34.080 --> 23:36.207
Yes.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.251
Come on,

23:38.292 --> 23:41.504
let's go find you these rascals.

23:41.546 --> 23:43.297
You went to a matchmaker
to put together

23:43.339 --> 23:44.549
a group of Nazi hunters?

23:44.590 --> 23:47.885
That's... the Jewiest shit
I've ever heard.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.053
Why'd they say yes?

23:50.805 --> 23:55.601
In time, you'll come
to know their stories.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.520
Their secrets.

23:57.562 --> 24:01.107
And perhaps you'll come
to tell them yours.

24:02.984 --> 24:07.196
We leave shortly.
Time for a hunt.

24:07.238 --> 24:10.241
Just... I said no.
- I am not sitting

24:10.283 --> 24:12.243
your beached whale of a cousin,

24:12.285 --> 24:14.370
the insufferable
Eileen Shekenstein,

24:14.412 --> 24:15.788
anywhere near us, Murray.

24:15.830 --> 24:19.041
It's Amy's wedding. She'll sit
where Amy wants her to sit.

24:19.083 --> 24:21.252
You know she's still never
apologized to me

24:21.294 --> 24:23.212
for missing
Simchas Torah dinner.

24:23.254 --> 24:24.964
Her husband died
the night before.

24:25.006 --> 24:28.134
Well, exactly. That gave her
a whole day to RSVP.

24:28.176 --> 24:29.969
Get in the car.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.849
Um... Oh.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.517
Okay.

24:37.852 --> 24:41.147
Uh... sorry, man.

24:41.189 --> 24:43.816
Bet you never met
a movie star before, huh?

24:43.858 --> 24:46.402
Judah Macca-bro,
how's it hanging?

24:46.444 --> 24:48.446
Uh, fine, yeah.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.449
You know, the fear goes away.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.075
What? No, no.

24:53.117 --> 24:56.162
No, I'm-I'm... I'm cool.
I'm just, uh...

24:56.204 --> 24:57.598
As scared as an
uncircumcised schlong

24:57.622 --> 25:00.541
at a mohel convention?
I was, too.

25:00.583 --> 25:02.835
Gets easier, trust me.

25:05.755 --> 25:10.635
You know, I loved Ruth
like she was my own bubbe.

25:10.676 --> 25:13.095
Though, if only she was
a couple years younger,

25:13.137 --> 25:15.014
I might've loved her
a little differently.

25:15.056 --> 25:17.934
Know what I'm saying?
Mazel'd her Tov.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.518
Gefilte'd her fish.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.104
- That's fucked up, man.
- Hey, she found me
at rock bottom.

25:22.146 --> 25:25.399
Okay, she kicked my ass
into shape.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.526
Not as good a shape
as Kris Kristofferson's ass.

25:27.568 --> 25:29.612
That ass should be
in the Louvre.

25:29.654 --> 25:31.364
That's a, that's a thing
of miracles,

25:31.405 --> 25:33.074
but she saved me.

25:33.115 --> 25:34.992
- She saved you?
- Oh, yeah.

25:35.034 --> 25:38.120
Yeah, she was
one special lady, Ruth.

25:38.162 --> 25:42.083
And because I loved her,
I love you, brother man.

25:42.124 --> 25:46.003
So if any of these dicks
mess with you, I will...

25:46.045 --> 25:47.481
Well, I'm-I'm not gonna
fuck with them

25:47.505 --> 25:49.131
'cause they scare
the shit out of me,

25:49.173 --> 25:50.883
but I will definitely be like,

25:50.925 --> 25:54.220
"Yeah, they suck"
behind their backs with you.

25:54.262 --> 25:57.306
Anything you need,
Lonny Flash has got you.

25:57.348 --> 26:00.559
Cheeks and Bootyhole are never
gonna believe this shit.

26:00.601 --> 26:02.436
Oh, yeah, who's Bootycall?

26:02.478 --> 26:05.481
Bootyhole and-and Cheeks,
they...

26:05.523 --> 26:07.566
They're just some kids
on my block.

26:07.608 --> 26:10.861
Yeah. Well, if only
they could see you now, right?

26:10.903 --> 26:13.572
A real life fucking
Jew-per hero.

26:13.614 --> 26:18.160
Don't be nervous, man.
This shit'll be fun.

26:18.202 --> 26:20.788
It's just like the movies, huh.

26:28.004 --> 26:30.172
This summer.

26:30.214 --> 26:31.841
Nazis beware.

26:33.301 --> 26:37.263
This Army of the Night
is out for your head.

26:37.305 --> 26:40.850
Reich? Wrong.

26:42.810 --> 26:44.520
Orion Pictures presents

26:44.562 --> 26:47.064
The Hunters.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.817
With newcomer Jonah Heidelbaum

26:49.859 --> 26:53.237
as The Codebreaker.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.573
Jonah?

26:55.614 --> 26:59.785
You good?
You were mumbling to yourself.

26:59.827 --> 27:03.247
Oh, yeah, I'm good.
I just, uh, had a little...

27:03.289 --> 27:05.333
tickle in my throat, you know?

27:05.374 --> 27:08.461
Little cough.

27:08.502 --> 27:09.879
Time to go,

27:09.920 --> 27:12.340
Codebreaker.

27:26.437 --> 27:28.647
Immigration and
Naturalization Services.

27:28.689 --> 27:31.150
Hey, Betty, it's Millie.
Uh, my flight was delayed,

27:31.192 --> 27:33.110
but I'll be across town
in an hour, so...

27:33.152 --> 27:35.446
Don't bother, Mil. I pulled
the file you called about.

27:35.488 --> 27:37.656
-Yeah?
-Gretel Fischer.
Ain't nothing in it.

27:37.698 --> 27:39.533
What do you mean
there ain't nothing in it?

27:39.575 --> 27:42.703
I don't know. It's been
cleared out. It's empty.

27:42.745 --> 27:45.956
- Your files are all empty?
- No, just hers and one other.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.042
Looks like her brother,
a Hans Fischer.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.502
Hans Fischer?

27:49.543 --> 27:52.755
The family's files
are just gone.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.886
My mom made me work out
with her this morning.

27:58.928 --> 28:01.597
She made me do the rhythm method
with her.

28:01.639 --> 28:05.059
Bro, you think the rhythm method
is something

28:05.101 --> 28:06.685
it definitely ain't.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.649
Fucking stairs.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.360
Yo, J-Money.

28:14.402 --> 28:17.696
He's not gonna answer.
He's mad at us.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.990
You're gonna have
to talk to us, bro.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.618
Yeah, we shouldn't have
left you. We should...

28:22.660 --> 28:24.370
Look, we're-we're sorry, okay?

28:24.412 --> 28:25.847
We should... We shouldn't have
chickened out.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.498
He ain't home.

28:29.959 --> 28:32.461
I haven't seen him in two days.

28:32.503 --> 28:35.881
Two fucking days?

28:35.923 --> 28:39.635
I was actually starting
to get worried.

28:39.677 --> 28:43.681
Shit's fishier than a mermaid's
cooch at a dolphin orgy.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.434
Where the fuck did he go?

28:46.475 --> 28:49.687
Yeah, Hans and Gretel

28:49.728 --> 28:51.981
hadn't spoken for years.

28:52.022 --> 28:55.276
- You know how siblings
can drift apart.
Mm.

28:55.317 --> 28:58.154
But when her son called
about the accident,

28:58.195 --> 29:00.531
I-I was beside myself.

29:00.573 --> 29:03.325
She was such
a sweet woman, Gretel.

29:03.367 --> 29:05.619
- Oh, thank you, Ms. Fischer.
- There you go.

29:05.661 --> 29:08.205
- Um, if I may...
- Mm-hmm?

29:08.247 --> 29:10.583
Why is the FBI involved?

29:10.624 --> 29:13.878
Well, uh, she worked for NASA.
Just standard procedure.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.254
Oh.

29:15.296 --> 29:18.716
Actually, Frannie, I was hoping
I could speak with your husband.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.385
Uh, well,

29:21.427 --> 29:23.804
that won't be possible,
unfortunately.

29:23.846 --> 29:28.642
Uh, Hans died in a car accident
six months ago.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.728
I'm sorry.

29:30.769 --> 29:35.399
Yes, he... he drove home late.

29:35.441 --> 29:39.528
A chicken pox outbreak in town

29:39.570 --> 29:42.198
that kept him at work.

29:42.239 --> 29:44.492
He never let a single child

29:44.533 --> 29:47.369
go untreated.

29:47.411 --> 29:50.039
Police said it looked like

29:50.080 --> 29:52.082
his engine exploded.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.295
The force

29:56.337 --> 29:59.465
ripped his teeth
right out of his mouth.

30:07.139 --> 30:11.060
Did you notice anything strange
before your husband died?

30:11.101 --> 30:13.729
Was he on edge?

30:13.771 --> 30:16.148
Anyone bothering him?

30:16.190 --> 30:20.027
No. What do you mean?

30:20.069 --> 30:22.488
Oh, I'm just turning over
every stone.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.454
He was very handsome.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.331
I read that Hans

30:32.373 --> 30:34.291
was a German war refugee
like his sister.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.834
What did he do during the war?

30:35.876 --> 30:38.337
Hans was a doctor.

30:38.379 --> 30:40.464
Red Cross.

30:42.299 --> 30:46.345
- Did he have to help any Jews?
- Yes.

30:46.387 --> 30:48.389
How did he feel about them?

30:48.430 --> 30:52.351
Well, how does anyone feel
about them, dear?

30:52.393 --> 30:54.520
They're Jews.

45:05.745 --> 45:08.623
Fucking Christ, come on, man.

45:08.665 --> 45:12.252
You're gonna burst
his fucking eardrums, stop.

45:13.253 --> 45:14.754
What the fuck are you doing?

45:22.262 --> 45:24.764
Oh, my God!

45:24.806 --> 45:26.992
-It's all right.
-His fucking ear's bleeding.
Stop it, man!

45:27.016 --> 45:28.518
We know it.

45:31.187 --> 45:33.440
My God, I just...

45:33.481 --> 45:35.233
I just...

45:35.275 --> 45:36.776
They mail me tapes.

45:36.818 --> 45:40.572
I p... I broadcast them,
that's all I do!

45:40.613 --> 45:43.366
Who? Who-who tells you
to play them?

45:45.034 --> 45:47.787
There's a man, a man...

45:47.829 --> 45:49.414
One man, I don't...

45:49.456 --> 45:51.291
He's the only one
I've ever seen.

45:51.332 --> 45:53.001
Richter?

45:53.042 --> 45:55.545
I don't know any Richter!

45:55.587 --> 45:58.089
I swear, I don't,

45:58.131 --> 45:59.924
I don't know his name.

45:59.966 --> 46:02.969
We don't use our real names.

46:03.011 --> 46:04.471
Oh, my God.

46:04.512 --> 46:07.015
He's a man like me.

46:09.350 --> 46:12.145
A man who was brought here.

46:12.187 --> 46:14.022
Brought here?
Brought here by whom?

46:18.026 --> 46:19.861
By you!

46:21.279 --> 46:23.823
By you.

46:23.865 --> 46:25.408
Meyerleh, we need you now.

46:25.450 --> 46:27.660
Broadcasting
to the whole tristate area.

46:30.788 --> 46:31.956
Watch him.

46:40.131 --> 46:42.509
Water. Water.

46:42.550 --> 46:45.762
Water. Please.

46:46.971 --> 46:49.390
Oh, God.

46:52.352 --> 46:56.439
- I didn't do what they say.
- Shut the fuck up, man.

46:58.483 --> 47:01.653
But I was your age
when I first heard him.

47:01.694 --> 47:03.738
I don't want to hear
your Hitler fan fiction.

47:03.780 --> 47:07.283
Not Hitler. Wagner.

47:08.535 --> 47:11.204
My father was a cruel man.

47:11.246 --> 47:13.748
He believed music was weak.

47:15.750 --> 47:19.963
If you even dared hum,
he beat you senseless.

47:21.923 --> 47:25.385
But when I was 17, I heard it.

47:25.426 --> 47:30.223
Coming from the halls
of the Berliner Philharmonie.

47:31.766 --> 47:34.102
I never wanted to hurt anyone.

47:34.143 --> 47:38.147
I was just a boy...

47:38.189 --> 47:41.901
following orders.

47:44.529 --> 47:46.281
Perhaps like you.

47:46.322 --> 47:47.782
Shut the fuck up.

47:47.824 --> 47:51.369
- Shut the fuck up.
- If you keep on this path,

47:51.411 --> 47:53.913
you will hear it, too.

47:53.955 --> 47:56.040
Forever.

47:56.082 --> 47:59.210
The ringing in your ears.

47:59.252 --> 48:01.879
That is why...

48:01.921 --> 48:04.757
I made them sing.

48:04.799 --> 48:06.926
To drown it out.

48:06.968 --> 48:09.178
The ringing.

48:09.220 --> 48:13.766
S-So I could hear
the music again.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.397
I need water.

48:19.439 --> 48:21.125
- All right, all right.
- I need the water, please.

48:21.149 --> 48:23.401
- Fuck, okay. Okay.
- Please.

48:23.443 --> 48:25.069
Thank you. Oh...

48:25.111 --> 48:26.863
Just tilt your head back.

48:30.700 --> 48:32.243
Fuck.

48:33.494 --> 48:36.748
Hey. Take it easy.

48:36.789 --> 48:39.500
If you want the boy to live...

48:39.542 --> 48:41.794
you will let me out
of this fucking...

48:41.836 --> 48:43.338
No!

48:43.379 --> 48:45.173
What?

48:50.720 --> 48:52.430
What the fuck did you do?

48:52.472 --> 48:54.849
He was our only fucking lead.

48:54.891 --> 48:56.452
- You fucking child!
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

48:56.476 --> 48:58.478
You did this!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- Come on!

48:58.519 --> 49:00.414
-I didn't mean to.
-Piece of shit child.
-You're okay.

49:00.438 --> 49:02.398
Kid fucked up,
got Holstedder killed.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.025
It blew the broadcast.

49:35.098 --> 49:37.016
We got to go.

49:37.058 --> 49:38.434
We got to go. Come.

49:38.476 --> 49:39.852
Get, uh, whatever you can.

49:39.894 --> 49:41.270
Take it, take it.

49:50.488 --> 49:52.073
Jonah!

49:57.495 --> 49:59.580
Hey.

49:59.622 --> 50:01.207
Yeah. Jonah, Jonah.

50:01.249 --> 50:02.792
Yeah.

50:02.834 --> 50:04.377
Here, come here.

50:04.419 --> 50:06.063
-Jonah.
-I got him killed.
I got him killed.

50:06.087 --> 50:08.089
No, no. A Nazi, yes.

50:08.131 --> 50:10.967
And he would have killed you
if it weren't for Joe.

50:11.008 --> 50:12.986
- He would've killed you.
- No. Were you still
gonna kill him?

50:13.010 --> 50:14.071
Were you still gonna kill him

50:14.095 --> 50:15.888
if you got everything
that you needed?

50:15.930 --> 50:17.908
Were you still gonna kill him?
Were you still gonna kill him?

50:17.932 --> 50:20.101
I would have
delivered justice, yes.

50:20.143 --> 50:23.062
- Yes.
- No. No, no.

50:23.104 --> 50:25.314
Fucking shit.
We should've brought him in.

50:25.356 --> 50:27.066
- What?
- We should've brought him in.

50:27.108 --> 50:28.502
-To whom?
-We could've brought him in.
We could've brought him in.

50:28.526 --> 50:30.069
Who do we bring him in to?

50:30.111 --> 50:31.672
The fucking... the police.
The fucking police, the Feds.

50:31.696 --> 50:33.406
Oh, no. Jonah, Jonah,
I told you this.

50:33.448 --> 50:35.092
The fucking... the people who
take care of this fucking shit.

50:35.116 --> 50:37.160
I told you this before,
didn't I?

50:37.201 --> 50:42.623
In this country, Lady Justice
may be blind to all,

50:42.665 --> 50:44.375
but to many of us,

50:44.417 --> 50:46.085
she is also deaf.

50:46.127 --> 50:51.424
Do you know how many Nazis
the U.S. executed at Nuremberg?

50:51.466 --> 50:53.676
Twelve.

50:53.718 --> 50:58.473
12 perpetrators
out of eight million.

50:58.514 --> 51:02.685
And they're on the march again,
these forever soldiers.

51:02.727 --> 51:05.271
These monsters.

51:05.313 --> 51:07.857
No wonder they thought
they could come here.

51:07.899 --> 51:12.862
So we are left... us...
To do God's work.

51:12.904 --> 51:14.363
Ruth's work, Jonah.

51:14.405 --> 51:16.824
Ruth's.

51:16.866 --> 51:17.867
Come.

51:17.909 --> 51:20.077
We are missing maariv.

51:20.119 --> 51:21.746
What the fuck is maariv?

51:21.788 --> 51:23.748
It's evening services.

51:23.790 --> 51:27.168
To say Mourner's Kaddish
for Ruth.

51:27.210 --> 51:28.890
- No, I don't believe in that.
- Oh, Jonah,

51:28.920 --> 51:30.800
it doesn't matter
if you believe or not believe.

51:30.838 --> 51:33.007
I don't care if you believe
in Santa Claus.

51:33.049 --> 51:36.552
It doesn't matter.
It's about Ruth, not about you.

51:36.594 --> 51:40.723
It is the duty of Ruth's family
to pray for her soul.

51:40.765 --> 51:45.353
And if ever a soul deserved it,
it would be hers. No?

51:47.021 --> 51:48.689
Come, Jonah. Come.

52:07.834 --> 52:09.961
You didn't get me a souvenir?

52:10.002 --> 52:12.004
No Mickey ears or some shit?

52:18.219 --> 52:20.847
How much did you miss me?

52:26.310 --> 52:28.312
What's wrong, mama?

52:40.867 --> 52:45.830
You know, people think
flamingos are pink.

52:49.417 --> 52:52.837
It's a common misconception.

52:52.879 --> 52:55.673
They are white.

52:55.715 --> 52:58.134
Pure white.

52:58.175 --> 53:03.639
It's the red blood of
what they eat, their prey,

53:03.681 --> 53:05.766
that gives them their color.

53:11.147 --> 53:14.525
Why were you looking into
Gretel Fischer, Detective?

53:14.567 --> 53:16.736
What did you find?

53:19.322 --> 53:21.365
Shh, shh, shh. It's okay.

53:21.407 --> 53:23.451
It's okay.

53:23.492 --> 53:25.453
Hey, hey, hey. Listen.

53:25.494 --> 53:28.331
Shh. Shh.

53:31.334 --> 53:34.670
I know undue stress
can be bad for the baby.

53:38.716 --> 53:42.553
So how about we play
a little game instead, hmm?

53:42.595 --> 53:45.222
Fowl-inspired, of course.

53:48.976 --> 53:50.686
Duck.

53:50.728 --> 53:52.146
Hey.

53:54.148 --> 53:56.150
Duck.

54:00.321 --> 54:01.864
Goose.

54:01.906 --> 54:03.282
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

54:03.324 --> 54:04.492
Hey! Hey!

54:04.533 --> 54:06.118
No! No!

54:13.334 --> 54:15.670
There was a photograph.

54:15.711 --> 54:17.713
Of Gretel and Hitler.

54:17.755 --> 54:20.049
She was a Nazi.

54:20.091 --> 54:23.094
- Who else knows about this?
- No one but me.

54:25.429 --> 54:27.515
Fun. Another round.

54:27.556 --> 54:29.517
No. No. No! No!

Hey.

54:33.354 --> 54:34.772
Spaghetti.

54:37.233 --> 54:38.651
Spaghetti.

54:42.113 --> 54:43.698
- Meatball.
- No.

54:43.739 --> 54:45.700
No, no, no!

54:57.712 --> 55:00.214
She was an FBI agent.

55:00.256 --> 55:03.592
She's... her name's Millie.

55:03.634 --> 55:05.052
Millie Morris.

Hansel and Gretel...
Do you know that story?

55:16.605 --> 55:21.027
Two German children...
Blond-haired, blue-eyed...

55:21.068 --> 55:25.656
Find this rich old witch
living in the woods.

55:25.698 --> 55:29.910
The... the kids claim that the
witch wants to eat them alive.

55:31.912 --> 55:34.957
You know, use their good
Christian blood for food.

55:34.999 --> 55:40.963
And so the German children
push her into an oven,

55:41.005 --> 55:45.718
watch her burn alive,
and steal her fortune.

55:45.760 --> 55:47.762

55:59.565 --> 56:03.736
You know, I think
they called her a witch, but...

56:03.778 --> 56:05.780
but they really meant Jew.

56:08.199 --> 56:12.661
This old Jewish woman,
living in the woods,

56:12.703 --> 56:17.750
banished from town,
not doing anything to anyone.

56:17.792 --> 56:21.212

just burned her alive.
