WEBVTT

00:09.500 --> 00:11.500
Hey, we're running
out of sun, dingbat.

00:11.583 --> 00:13.750
- Come on. Let's play.
- Let me finish.

00:13.834 --> 00:15.333
Oh, hi, Skip.

00:15.417 --> 00:16.583
Oh, that's a
good one,
son.

00:16.667 --> 00:17.875
You even got
the robin's
nest.

00:17.959 --> 00:20.291
Thanks, Ma.
Where's Dad?

00:20.375 --> 00:22.125
Working late, I suppose.

00:22.208 --> 00:24.125
(male announcer on radio)
'And now, a new update.'

00:24.208 --> 00:27.500
'Yesterday, Japan continued
its attacks along Mount
Samat.'

00:27.583 --> 00:31.625
'The US Philippine Division
suffered heavy losses..'

00:35.667 --> 00:38.625
- Oh, my God.
- Golly.

00:48.750 --> 00:51.083
Sorry I'm late, sweetheart.

00:51.166 --> 00:52.875
How can we afford a new car?

00:52.959 --> 00:55.667
(Ray)
'The bank just cleared us
a loan for two new stores.'

00:55.750 --> 00:57.208
It's called franchising.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.959
I thought they said "no".

00:59.041 --> 01:01.041
I went to the old backup plan.

01:01.125 --> 01:03.166
The backup plan
being "Don't give
up?"

01:03.250 --> 01:05.083
- Never fails.
- Is this a Packard?

01:05.166 --> 01:07.875
Yep, gonna drive you
to art classes in style.

01:09.959 --> 01:13.125
Hey, what do we have here?

01:13.208 --> 01:14.917
Some fatheads at school.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.375
Blame me for Pearl Harbor.

01:16.458 --> 01:19.333
But we're as
American as those boys.

01:19.417 --> 01:20.917
You sock 'em back?

01:21.000 --> 01:24.166
- I thought fighting was bad.
- 'It is.'

01:24.250 --> 01:26.875
But standin' up for yourself
is another thing, son.

01:26.959 --> 01:29.667
Don't forget
that,
alright?

01:29.750 --> 01:31.458
Game of touch, Mr. T?

01:31.542 --> 01:33.709
- Absolutely, Skip.
- Here you go.

01:33.792 --> 01:35.291
Come on, huddle up,
Billy. You, too, honey.

01:35.375 --> 01:37.917
- Let's go.
- Skip, you're going down.

01:39.291 --> 01:41.583
Come on.
You stay away there, Skip.

01:41.667 --> 01:43.291
Alright, let's
do this. Ready?

01:43.375 --> 01:46.333
Ready?
Team!

01:46.417 --> 01:47.875
342!

01:47.959 --> 01:49.125
342!

01:49.208 --> 01:51.166
Oh, never seen such
a swell-looking center.

01:51.250 --> 01:52.834
What are ya doing
after the game, hotcakes?

01:52.917 --> 01:54.125
Wouldn't you like to know.

01:54.208 --> 01:57.417
- Dad, come on!
- Alright, hike!

02:05.125 --> 02:06.417
Dad?

02:17.208 --> 02:19.208
'"All Japanese persons,
both alien'

02:19.291 --> 02:21.291
"and non-alien,
will be evacuated

02:21.375 --> 02:25.375
"by noon
on April 7, 1942."

02:25.458 --> 02:27.875
What do they mean,
"alien and
non-alien"?

02:30.625 --> 02:31.792
They mean us.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.625
Court that bad?

03:11.291 --> 03:14.083
Coffee there makes
this stuff gourmet.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.417
The last day of
boss'
suspension.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.083
Jeffries said he put in
his retirement papers.

03:25.875 --> 03:27.542
Any word on
who'll be coming
in?

03:27.625 --> 03:29.625
Well, not Jeffries.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.125
Some clown from West.

03:31.208 --> 03:33.792
Been reassigned six times.

03:33.875 --> 03:36.417
Don't know what I'd do if I
didn't come here every day.

03:36.500 --> 03:37.500
Some things I'd miss.

03:37.583 --> 03:40.709
Some things I wouldn't,
like court.

03:40.792 --> 03:43.792
All pains in the
ass,
those ADAs.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.709
Yeah, real pains.

03:45.792 --> 03:49.000
Oil and water,
cops and lawyers.

03:49.083 --> 03:50.625
Usually, that is.

03:50.709 --> 03:52.458
More like 24/7.

03:52.542 --> 03:53.750
(Barbara)
'Excuse me.'

03:53.834 --> 03:55.834
Are you detectives?

03:55.917 --> 03:57.166
Yeah.

03:58.500 --> 04:02.166
My father, Raymond Takahashi,
was killed

04:02.250 --> 04:04.125
'in 1945.'

04:04.208 --> 04:05.250
They never caught who did it.

04:05.333 --> 04:08.166
60-plus years ago, long time.

04:08.250 --> 04:11.458
I just found a $20,000 check
from the government

04:11.542 --> 04:13.500
issued to my mother in 1990.

04:13.583 --> 04:14.792
Tax refund?

04:16.750 --> 04:18.291
Restitution.

04:18.375 --> 04:19.875
(Barbara)
'My family was'

04:19.959 --> 04:22.500
at the Manzanar
Relocation
Center.

04:22.583 --> 04:24.583
Manzanar, what's that?

04:24.667 --> 04:26.041
A camp in California

04:26.125 --> 04:28.208
where they held
Japanese-Americans

04:28.291 --> 04:29.291
'during World War II.'

04:29.375 --> 04:31.500
An internment camp.

04:31.583 --> 04:33.375
I was born there.

04:33.458 --> 04:35.333
Never knew it.
My mother was..

04:35.417 --> 04:36.834
too ashamed to tell me.

04:36.917 --> 04:39.834
So what's that got to do
with your father's murder?

04:39.917 --> 04:41.458
Well, my father was
killed a few months

04:41.542 --> 04:43.875
after we got out,
moved to Philly.

04:43.959 --> 04:46.166
Maybe the police were looking

04:46.250 --> 04:48.542
in the wrong place
for his murderer?

04:48.625 --> 04:50.417
Maybe.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.083
(Barbara)
'I found this old
picture..'

04:53.166 --> 04:57.125
'...of my parents
and my big brother, Billy.'

04:58.291 --> 05:00.166
Well, he died in the war.

05:01.750 --> 05:04.083
'The way she smiled at them..'

05:04.166 --> 05:05.875
she never looks
at me like that.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.625
I'd love one chance to meet

05:10.709 --> 05:12.208
the woman in that picture.

05:14.583 --> 05:15.709
We'll take a look.

05:15.792 --> 05:17.500
Can't promise
we'll find anything.

05:17.583 --> 05:18.875
I understand.

05:20.625 --> 05:21.875
Thank you.

05:24.125 --> 05:27.000
So the guy
survives
being locked up

05:27.083 --> 05:29.208
in an internment camp.

05:29.291 --> 05:31.750
Only to be killed
in the City of Brotherly Love.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.041
Ray Takahashi.

06:08.125 --> 06:09.583
'Body found a few blocks
from the old'

06:09.667 --> 06:10.917
Municipal Stadium.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.792
(Will)
'Night of the Army/Navy
football game.'

06:12.875 --> 06:14.583
He was beaten,
pushed down a flight

06:14.667 --> 06:16.083
of stairs,
broke his neck.

06:16.166 --> 06:18.542
Theory was some drunk
bigot roughed him up.

06:18.625 --> 06:20.208
Took things too far.

06:20.291 --> 06:21.625
All of two interviews

06:21.709 --> 06:22.792
worked real hard on this one.

06:22.875 --> 06:25.083
'Cause, "A Jap's a Jap," right?

06:25.166 --> 06:26.917
Well, Ray's family
lived in California

06:27.000 --> 06:28.250
till FDR banned all

06:28.333 --> 06:31.709
Japanese-Americans
from the West Coast in 1942.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.208
(Will)
'Over 100,000'

06:33.291 --> 06:35.625
were forced into camps
without due process.

06:35.709 --> 06:37.166
Most were born and raised here.

06:37.250 --> 06:39.458
And none were ever arrested
for espionage.

06:39.542 --> 06:43.208
Ray's son, Billy, gave up his
life for the American dream.

06:43.291 --> 06:45.625
Died overseas in 1944.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.500
Found an empty envelope
on Ray's body.

06:48.583 --> 06:49.917
Addressed to him
in Manzanar.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.834
Return address just
says "APO-513."

06:52.917 --> 06:55.834
Army Post Office, how we used
to get our mail home.

06:55.917 --> 06:57.458
The letter could be
from his kid, Billy.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.000
(Rush)
'Not likely; it was mailed'

06:59.083 --> 07:01.542
November 27, 1944.

07:01.625 --> 07:03.709
Billy died October 30.

07:03.792 --> 07:05.375
(Will)
An envelope, no letter.

07:05.458 --> 07:06.917
Contents could be a motive.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.208
So what's our
letter writer
hidin'?

07:09.291 --> 07:11.291
Something that happened
at Manzanar?

07:11.375 --> 07:13.625
Let's track down all the
records
we can get from there

07:13.709 --> 07:15.667
and have Latents take a look.

07:15.750 --> 07:17.000
(Valens)
'Good luck getting a print
off'

07:17.083 --> 07:18.834
a 60-year-old envelope.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.834
Boss was military, too.

07:21.917 --> 07:24.000
Might have some input.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.166
You'd have better luck
with the print.

07:32.125 --> 07:33.583
Thank you.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.709
Quiet getting to you?

07:39.792 --> 07:42.125
I'm not much
of a cook, frankly.

07:42.208 --> 07:43.750
Right.

07:43.834 --> 07:45.667
You here for the chili?

07:45.750 --> 07:47.667
No, for a job.

07:47.750 --> 07:52.542
A Japanese-American camp
internee killed in '45.

07:52.625 --> 07:54.750
Night of the Army/Navy game.

07:54.834 --> 07:56.959
My father went to that game.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.125
Proud Army man.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.000
Well, it must've
broke his heart.

08:00.083 --> 08:01.458
- You going Navy.
- 'Uh.'

08:01.542 --> 08:04.083
He got over it...eventually.

08:06.667 --> 08:09.166
Found this on
our
victim's body.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.709
APO's the only
clue
to who sent it.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.083
Well, have
Latents take a look.

08:14.166 --> 08:16.834
I'm sure Jeffries
already told you that.

08:18.625 --> 08:20.625
(Rush)
'Our victim's son, Billy'

08:20.709 --> 08:23.166
died in the war.
Was an Army guy

08:23.250 --> 08:26.250
442nd.

08:26.333 --> 08:28.417
An all
Japanese-American unit.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.625
Most decorated battalion
for its size.

08:30.709 --> 08:32.500
I could use your eyes
on this one, boss.

08:34.667 --> 08:37.125
I put my papers in already,
Lil.
You know that.

08:41.333 --> 08:44.500
So what're we supposed to do
without you kickin' our asses?

08:45.875 --> 08:47.250
Huh?

08:47.333 --> 08:48.750
You'll survive.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.458
Enjoy your chili.

09:11.458 --> 09:14.125
Why did you bring this
stranger here, Barbara?

09:14.208 --> 09:15.375
You know I don't
wanna talk about
it.

09:15.458 --> 09:17.834
It's been 62 years, mom.

09:17.917 --> 09:19.208
'Isn't it time you did?'

09:19.291 --> 09:22.625
You recognize this,
Mrs. Takahashi?

09:22.709 --> 09:24.166
- No.
- Your husband had it.

09:24.250 --> 09:25.625
When he was killed.

09:25.709 --> 09:27.917
He know anyone in the Army
who might've sent it?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.417
No.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.750
That's quite the picture.

09:36.834 --> 09:38.750
'You draw that?'

09:38.834 --> 09:41.458
My son did. Billy.

09:41.542 --> 09:44.375
That's him with his best
friend,
Skip, from home.

09:44.458 --> 09:47.375
Heard about your son's
unit, the 442nd.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.000
Not many have.

09:50.083 --> 09:51.583
Real heroic guys.

09:53.709 --> 09:57.125
The war was supposed
to make us equal.

09:57.208 --> 09:58.333
It didn't.

09:58.417 --> 10:00.667
Because you were in the camps?

10:02.625 --> 10:03.875
It's okay to talk
about it, mom--

10:03.959 --> 10:05.333
What difference does it make?

10:05.417 --> 10:07.417
Solving your husband's murder.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.166
'Maybe Manzanar had
something to do with it.'

10:09.250 --> 10:11.959
Why? We were just a number.

10:12.041 --> 10:14.834
No names. 8108.

10:14.917 --> 10:16.250
Like criminals.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.834
He make any enemies there?

10:20.875 --> 10:22.417
From the moment we arrived.

10:23.917 --> 10:25.291
(male #1)
'Let's go! Bring it out!
Let's go!'

10:25.375 --> 10:26.709
- Come on, right now!
- Yes, sir.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.458
Move it
out, quickly! Quickly!

10:28.542 --> 10:30.542
Come on, right here!
Right here! In a line!

10:30.625 --> 10:31.834
Right here! Let's go!

10:31.917 --> 10:32.834
'Get your things.'

10:32.917 --> 10:34.041
'Come on, right here, let's go.'

10:34.125 --> 10:37.208
'Come on, move it.'

10:51.625 --> 10:53.625
How long are we
going to be here for?

10:53.709 --> 10:54.709
Not too long.

10:54.792 --> 10:57.291
It's for our
own
protection.

10:57.375 --> 10:59.792
But why are the guns
pointed at us?

10:59.875 --> 11:01.667
Billy, we just sit tight,
be good citizens and

11:01.750 --> 11:03.834
we'll be out of here
lickety-split, understand?

11:05.834 --> 11:06.875
Your name, sir?

11:06.959 --> 11:08.250
Takahashi.

11:08.333 --> 11:11.375
Okay, you will be
in Block 18, room
7

11:11.458 --> 11:13.250
with the Watanabe family.

11:13.333 --> 11:14.959
We have to share?

11:15.041 --> 11:16.583
At least we'll be together.

11:17.458 --> 11:19.333
Mattresses.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.417
Down the way, you can
fill them with straw.

11:23.709 --> 11:25.250
Uh, so how is the school here?

11:25.333 --> 11:28.875
Bet you folks didn't know you've
got a young Rembrandt visiting.

11:28.959 --> 11:30.750
Oh, are you an artist?

11:30.834 --> 11:32.542
- I guess.
- Me too.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.333
I teach a pen and ink class.

11:34.417 --> 11:35.709
It's gonna be fun.

11:39.417 --> 11:40.917
I made this

11:41.000 --> 11:43.750
so that you don't forget
you're Americans.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.834
I just wanted to give
you
some sort of welcome.

11:45.917 --> 11:47.458
Well, your smile
is welcome enough.

11:47.542 --> 11:49.792
I've seen nothing
but frowns all day.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.625
Sun's still shinning.

11:51.709 --> 11:53.000
Don't understand.

11:53.083 --> 11:55.959
He messing with
you, Mary Anne?

11:56.041 --> 11:58.291
No, Larry. It's okay.

11:58.375 --> 12:01.458
Don't know why they let
you
people in this country.

12:01.542 --> 12:03.250
- I was born here.
- Uh-huh?

12:03.333 --> 12:04.667
Bet you got cousins
in the old country

12:04.750 --> 12:06.875
fighting for the emperor?

12:06.959 --> 12:09.583
Scholz. That German?

12:09.667 --> 12:10.875
Your cousins fighting
for Hitler?

12:10.959 --> 12:13.583
You watch it, mister.

12:13.667 --> 12:14.959
Pick it up.

12:15.041 --> 12:16.458
I said pick it up, Jap.

12:36.959 --> 12:39.667
The funny thing
about wars, kid..

12:39.750 --> 12:42.041
...they always find
a way to end.

12:42.125 --> 12:43.834
Hope we meet outside
this fence one day.

12:43.917 --> 12:45.458
Count on that.

12:45.542 --> 12:46.792
Yeah.

12:51.291 --> 12:54.083
And this guard had it out
for your husband?

12:54.166 --> 12:56.917
He trolled the
camp,
gun at the ready

12:57.000 --> 12:58.166
looking for trouble.

12:58.250 --> 13:00.709
He and Ray ever have
another run-in?

13:00.792 --> 13:02.208
Not that I know of.

13:04.959 --> 13:06.291
(Vera)
'I found our guard.'

13:06.375 --> 13:09.250
Larry Scholz.
Shipped out of Manzanar in
'43.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.667
Stationed in Italy
till the end of the war.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.500
A rock-solid
alibi
if I ever heard
one.

13:13.583 --> 13:16.834
Not quite. Got a medal at
the 1945 Army/Navy Game

13:16.917 --> 13:18.041
'here in Philly.'

13:18.125 --> 13:19.333
It's the same night
Ray was killed.

13:19.417 --> 13:20.959
(Valens)
'Maybe they met up again'

13:21.041 --> 13:23.500
and Larry decided the world
needed one less Jap.

13:23.583 --> 13:26.417
'Cause keeping them
in prison wasn't
enough.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.250
We were at war.

13:28.333 --> 13:30.750
They'd have done the same to us
if we were in Japan.

13:30.834 --> 13:32.834
Feel the same
if it was your family?

13:35.834 --> 13:39.250
So where's Larry Scholz's
current place of residence?

13:39.333 --> 13:42.375
Uh...VA Hospital
at Virginia.

13:42.458 --> 13:44.667
Whoa. That's a five-hour drive.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.083
Shame I got
all this
paperwork.

13:49.166 --> 13:50.959
Shame I'm still on hold.

13:51.041 --> 13:52.917
Have fun,
sweet-talkin
g

13:53.000 --> 13:54.458
tollbooth attendants.

13:56.041 --> 13:57.291
Yeah.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.458
(Vera)
'Larry Scholz?'

14:04.625 --> 14:06.041
(Miller)
'Philly PD.'

14:06.125 --> 14:07.750
Here about Ray Takahashi.

14:07.834 --> 14:09.375
Taga what?

14:09.458 --> 14:11.291
Hashi. Takahashi.

14:11.375 --> 14:14.250
He was at the Manzanar
internment camp in 1942

14:14.333 --> 14:15.250
under your watch.

14:15.333 --> 14:16.750
(Vera)
'Murdered in '45.'

14:16.834 --> 14:18.083
Witness thinks
you had a beef with him.

14:18.166 --> 14:20.083
Beef? You kidding me?

14:20.166 --> 14:21.875
I was just doing my job.

14:21.959 --> 14:23.166
We were at war.

14:23.250 --> 14:24.750
Imprisoning
our own citizens.

14:24.834 --> 14:26.250
Yeah, that makes sense.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.000
Sayin' you wouldn't
think twice about

14:28.083 --> 14:31.250
sittin' on a plane
next to an Arab after 9/11?

14:34.083 --> 14:35.333
Come on.

14:36.959 --> 14:40.625
Did you send this to Ray
while overseas?

14:40.709 --> 14:42.750
Never seen that before
in my life.

14:42.834 --> 14:43.792
Look close.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.667
I'll look all you want.

14:45.750 --> 14:48.291
I didn't send that letter
to some enemy of the state.

14:48.375 --> 14:50.125
Hated the guy, didn't you?

14:50.208 --> 14:53.291
Kept tabs on him at camp, sure.

14:53.375 --> 14:54.417
Part of my duties.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.959
How long did
you watch Ray
for?

14:56.041 --> 14:58.875
Till I realized his old ball
and chain was keeping him

14:58.959 --> 15:01.500
too busy
to make any trouble.

15:12.875 --> 15:15.500
You drawing me
another pretty blue jay?

15:15.583 --> 15:16.875
Sure, Ma.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.083
Hey, Roosevelt
lifted the ban

15:20.166 --> 15:22.166
against Japanese-American
enlistment.

15:22.250 --> 15:23.583
Does that mean
we can leave?

15:23.667 --> 15:26.458
Oh, no. But it means
you can enlist, son.

15:26.542 --> 15:27.500
Enlist?

15:27.583 --> 15:29.709
Prove we're as American
as the rest.

15:29.792 --> 15:31.208
(Ray)
'You're gonna make
a great soldier.'

15:31.291 --> 15:33.083
I know you got it in ya.

15:35.083 --> 15:38.500
- This what I'd be fighting
for?
- Billy..

15:38.583 --> 15:40.667
What would I say
on the first day,
Dad?

15:40.750 --> 15:42.542
Private 8108,
reporting to
duty?

15:42.625 --> 15:44.083
This is just temporary.

15:44.166 --> 15:46.041
We act right,
prove ourselves

15:46.125 --> 15:47.375
they'll see
we don't belong here.

15:47.458 --> 15:48.750
I'm not going.

15:55.417 --> 15:58.208
What the hell's
the matter with
him?

15:58.291 --> 15:59.667
We've been
acting
"right"

15:59.750 --> 16:01.166
for a year
already
in this place.

16:01.250 --> 16:02.875
The whole country's
making sacrifices.

16:02.959 --> 16:04.250
We have to play our part.

16:04.333 --> 16:07.333
We're living in a
shack,
standing in line

16:07.417 --> 16:08.625
for food like beggars.

16:08.709 --> 16:10.917
We have lost
everything
we worked for.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.959
Open your eyes,
Ray, for once!

16:14.834 --> 16:16.667
Wait, wait, wait!

16:16.750 --> 16:18.083
Wait, wait...Come on!

16:18.166 --> 16:20.750
You love them, Evelyn!
You love those plates.

16:24.375 --> 16:25.667
I'm pregnant.

16:29.166 --> 16:30.417
What?

16:31.333 --> 16:32.583
You are?

16:33.500 --> 16:34.792
That's fantastic.

16:37.834 --> 16:41.500
I can't raise a baby
in a place like this.

16:43.834 --> 16:44.750
Not as a prisoner.

16:51.500 --> 16:54.458
Didn't have it in me
to harass him after that.

16:54.542 --> 16:56.500
Real sweet
of you,
Larry.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.458
Where were you the
night
of the Army/Navy game?

16:58.542 --> 17:00.959
Getting my medal.
Ask Truman.

17:01.041 --> 17:02.417
Ceremony didn't last all night.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.041
Talk to my commanding officer.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.583
He's right down the hall.

17:05.667 --> 17:08.083
In the president's suite.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.583
(Rush)
'Larry Scholz's lieutenant'

17:09.667 --> 17:10.792
confirmed his alibi.

17:10.875 --> 17:12.542
A real door prize,
that guy.

17:12.625 --> 17:15.542
Forgot your file, Lil.

17:15.625 --> 17:16.875
John.

17:18.667 --> 17:20.667
Good to see you.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.083
Just droppin' it off.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.959
Any thoughts
on who sent the
envelope?

17:26.375 --> 17:28.291
I talked to my
military contacts about it.

17:28.375 --> 17:31.291
The Army Post Office number
came from a French hospital.

17:31.375 --> 17:33.667
- 'No Army examiner's stamp.'
- Meaning?

17:33.750 --> 17:35.458
Meaning it didn't go
through inspection.

17:35.542 --> 17:37.125
It came from an officer.

17:37.208 --> 17:38.709
Hmm. Thanks.

17:40.125 --> 17:41.792
Gotta go. Good luck.

17:47.041 --> 17:48.875
Just dropping
something off.

17:48.959 --> 17:50.208
Right.

17:50.291 --> 17:51.583
Manzanar logs.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.959
One visitor the three years
Ray was there.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.083
Skip Robertson.

17:55.166 --> 17:56.500
Billy's friend.

17:56.583 --> 17:58.041
Makes sense
he would
visit.

17:58.125 --> 18:01.417
Turns out Skip was
also Billy's lieutenant.

18:01.500 --> 18:05.125
Injured in the same battle
that killed Billy in France.

18:05.208 --> 18:06.875
Could be our letter writer.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.583
So what's he hidin'?

18:20.917 --> 18:23.333
Appreciate you driving
out from Jersey, Skip.

18:23.417 --> 18:25.000
Oh, please, call me Eugene.

18:25.083 --> 18:26.333
Hmm.

18:26.417 --> 18:27.834
Recognize this handwriting?

18:27.917 --> 18:30.750
'Yeah...it's mine.'

18:30.834 --> 18:31.834
Where'd you get it?

18:31.917 --> 18:33.291
Ray Takahashi had it

18:33.375 --> 18:34.750
when someone pushed him
down a flight of stairs

18:34.834 --> 18:37.834
the night of the
Army/Navy
game in '45.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.500
Ray Takahashi was murdered?

18:39.583 --> 18:42.250
You that someone, Skip?
Give him a push?

18:42.333 --> 18:44.458
Probably were in town
for the game. Right?

18:44.542 --> 18:47.000
I was with my Army buddies
all night

18:47.083 --> 18:48.542
and I can give you names.

18:48.625 --> 18:49.834
Do that.

18:49.917 --> 18:51.625
Listen, Billy was
my best friend.

18:51.709 --> 18:54.500
The Takahashis were
like family to me.

18:54.583 --> 18:57.917
Look, after Billy died,
I was sent to the South
Pacific.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.750
- And we lost touch.
- What was in the envelope?

19:00.834 --> 19:03.542
It was the last letter
Billy wrote before he died.

19:03.625 --> 19:06.291
I found it on his things
and sent it to his family.

19:06.375 --> 19:09.500
- What'd it say?
- I don't know.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.667
Listen, Billy was
a brave soldier.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.500
They all were, the 442nd.

19:13.583 --> 19:16.750
Billy didn't seem like
your
average gung-ho
soldier.

19:16.834 --> 19:19.375
He didn't want to enlist,
and it broke Ray's heart.

19:19.458 --> 19:21.750
And that's the reason
Ray asked me to come visit.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.542
I just can't wait
to get overseas.

19:25.625 --> 19:27.750
Let those Nazis have it.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.000
Your parents
must be so
proud.

19:32.166 --> 19:33.709
Your dad says
you're not joining up.

19:35.583 --> 19:38.875
No matter what we do,
we'll always be Japs to them.

19:38.959 --> 19:40.291
Hey, you won't
fight
for this country

19:40.375 --> 19:42.458
you make them right
about us, Billy.

19:42.542 --> 19:44.750
What do you know
about fighting?

19:44.834 --> 19:46.750
What?

19:46.834 --> 19:49.500
Why didn't you
sock
that guard, Dad?

19:49.583 --> 19:51.333
I thought you were supposed
to stand up for yourself.

19:51.417 --> 19:52.583
(Ray)
'You are, but..'

19:52.667 --> 19:54.709
...things
aren't
so simple now

19:54.792 --> 19:56.083
not in this world.

19:56.166 --> 19:59.208
They treat
us
like dirt
here.

19:59.291 --> 20:01.458
How can you ask me
to fight when you
won't?

20:05.792 --> 20:07.750
(Shinji)
'Ray.'

20:07.834 --> 20:09.250
You been telling boys
on the block to enlist?

20:09.333 --> 20:10.583
You stay out of this, Shinji.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.125
No, you stay out.

20:12.208 --> 20:13.875
This country treats our
children like caged
animals--

20:13.959 --> 20:15.709
Lower your voice.

20:15.792 --> 20:17.500
The guards will hear you,
send you away.

20:17.583 --> 20:18.875
Guards.

20:21.709 --> 20:23.959
You know what this is?

20:24.041 --> 20:25.875
Toilet paper.
Guess what we are.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.000
He do this?

20:43.083 --> 20:44.166
Don't ask me
that, guard.

20:44.250 --> 20:46.208
I'll ask what I want, Tojo.

20:46.291 --> 20:48.333
Did this man desecrate
the American flag?

20:54.458 --> 20:55.709
Yes.

20:57.417 --> 20:59.083
You worthless traitor!

20:59.166 --> 21:01.000
'You'll have our boys'
blood on your hands!'

21:01.083 --> 21:02.125
'This isn't over, Ray!'

21:02.208 --> 21:04.750
This isn't over!

21:04.834 --> 21:08.875
'Our kids, think about it!
Our kids!'

21:20.417 --> 21:22.333
I never forget the look
on his face..

21:23.583 --> 21:25.083
...like Billy abandoned him.

21:25.166 --> 21:27.500
Do you know if Shinji and
Ray
clashed again after that?

21:27.583 --> 21:30.166
Now, Shinji was sent off
to Tule Lake that day

21:30.250 --> 21:33.500
for desecrating the flag,
and I saw him leave myself.

21:41.417 --> 21:45.500
(Vera)
'Looking into the 1945 murder
of Ray Takahashi.'

21:45.583 --> 21:47.667
Name ring a bell?

21:47.750 --> 21:49.375
We lived in that
rat hole they called

21:49.458 --> 21:51.500
a detention center.
So what?

21:51.583 --> 21:54.333
Heard Manzanar was no
picnic;
Tule Lake was even worse.

21:54.417 --> 21:56.667
(Valens)
'Long interrogations,
cold weather'

21:56.750 --> 21:58.500
stockades,
you put up with a lot.

21:58.583 --> 22:01.041
All because Ray Takahashi
pinned you for a flag
burner.

22:01.125 --> 22:03.458
(Valens)
'Then Ray ends up dead
in the same city'

22:03.542 --> 22:05.375
you set up residence in.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.333
Coincidence?

22:07.417 --> 22:09.375
A lot of us came here
after the war

22:09.458 --> 22:11.375
because of the Quakers.

22:11.458 --> 22:14.208
They helped us
get back on our feet.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.125
My wife and I stuck.

22:17.208 --> 22:18.417
(Valens)
A guy like that

22:18.500 --> 22:22.333
"traitor", sends me
away from my family

22:22.417 --> 22:24.041
I'd be pretty pissed off.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.875
So maybe you get
out of Tule Lake

22:25.959 --> 22:27.250
sore to find your buddy Ray.

22:27.333 --> 22:29.917
I was still behind barbed wire
when Ray died.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.125
Didn't get out
of Tule Lake till '46

22:32.208 --> 22:33.583
'cause I answered "no" twice

22:33.667 --> 22:35.959
to the government
loyalty questionnaire.

22:36.041 --> 22:37.417
Loyalty questionnaire?

22:37.500 --> 22:40.083
Asked if we'd be willing
to fight in the war

22:40.166 --> 22:42.458
renounce the Japanese emperor.

22:42.542 --> 22:44.125
Oh, and you refused to?

22:45.834 --> 22:48.834
Didn't know
the damn emperor's name.

22:48.917 --> 22:50.250
I was born here.

22:50.333 --> 22:51.583
Just like you.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.834
As far as the government
was concerned..

23:00.750 --> 23:02.500
..."I was just a Jap".

23:04.750 --> 23:06.041
'And so was Ray.'

23:07.959 --> 23:09.667
But he still couldn't see it.

23:26.959 --> 23:28.250
Hey, Ray.

23:28.333 --> 23:29.625
You done for the day?

23:29.709 --> 23:31.417
Ah, almost.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.917
(Ray)
'I've been reading up
on your hometown,
Philadelphia.'

23:34.000 --> 23:36.333
Understand the Quakers
have quite a presence there.

23:36.417 --> 23:37.709
We do.

23:37.792 --> 23:41.333
Maybe when this
business is over..

23:41.417 --> 23:43.500
...you could help introduce
me to some folks.

23:43.583 --> 23:44.625
Of course.

23:44.709 --> 23:47.500
I could help you
find an
apartment.

23:47.583 --> 23:49.917
I appreciate it.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.166
Uh, wait, I have
something for
you.

23:53.834 --> 23:55.166
Carrots.

23:55.250 --> 23:56.542
For your victory garden.

23:56.625 --> 23:58.250
You and Billy can plant them.

23:58.333 --> 24:01.834
Thanks, but I'm
on my own today.

24:01.917 --> 24:03.875
Oh, busy with classes?

24:03.959 --> 24:07.417
Busy blaming me
for the whole war.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.875
It's that age.

24:09.959 --> 24:11.709
He..

24:11.792 --> 24:13.333
He doesn't want to enlist.

24:13.417 --> 24:16.333
Doesn't believe in dying
for this country.

24:16.417 --> 24:17.667
Does it make me
a bad American

24:17.750 --> 24:19.417
if part of me believes
that now, too?

24:19.500 --> 24:22.375
No. Not in this place.

24:22.458 --> 24:25.750
I always thought
I'd be judged on my
character..

24:25.834 --> 24:27.583
...not my skin.

24:29.500 --> 24:30.959
- I was wrong.
- Ray.

24:31.041 --> 24:33.250
You have to know

24:33.333 --> 24:36.375
I never saw
you
as the enemy.

24:36.458 --> 24:38.917
It's not fair that
you
have to start
over.

24:41.291 --> 24:43.417
I've been starting over
my whole life.

24:44.750 --> 24:45.792
Easy as pie.

24:49.625 --> 24:51.291
Thanks.

24:51.375 --> 24:52.625
For what?

24:54.959 --> 24:57.625
You make me forget about
where we really are.

25:05.667 --> 25:07.500
You make me forget, too.

25:22.500 --> 25:25.291
So, Ray and the Quaker
were doing the dirty?

25:25.375 --> 25:28.208
The man preached loyalty
on his soapbox

25:28.291 --> 25:29.667
but he wasn't loyal.

25:31.375 --> 25:32.959
At least not to his wife.

25:37.542 --> 25:38.667
Thanks for your time.

25:44.041 --> 25:46.583
So Mary Anne helped
Ray move to Philly.

25:46.667 --> 25:47.709
Continued the affair?

25:47.792 --> 25:49.667
Or not, if Evelyn found out.

25:49.750 --> 25:51.083
Dumped mistress,
betrayed wife.

25:51.166 --> 25:52.417
Nothing worse
than
a woman scorned.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.583
How about two?

25:57.667 --> 25:59.667
(Mary)
'Ray Takahashi?'

25:59.750 --> 26:02.291
Haven't heard that
name
in 60 years.

26:02.375 --> 26:03.792
We're investigating his murder.

26:03.875 --> 26:05.166
Heard you two were pretty close.

26:05.250 --> 26:08.041
Acquaintances at best.

26:08.125 --> 26:10.625
That all, Mary Anne?

26:10.709 --> 26:12.458
What are you implying?

26:12.542 --> 26:13.917
That you killed him.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.834
'When he wouldn't
leave his wife for you.'

26:15.917 --> 26:19.000
You think I killed my husband?

26:19.083 --> 26:21.583
That I wanted to
raise a child on my own?

26:21.667 --> 26:25.834
That era? Easier to be
a widow than a
divorcee.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.375
Yes.

26:27.458 --> 26:28.667
Easy.

26:28.750 --> 26:30.583
First Ray has an
affair
with a white woman.

26:30.667 --> 26:32.625
Next he's hauling
you and the baby

26:32.709 --> 26:35.083
around the
country
to her hometown.

26:35.166 --> 26:37.083
Talk about a
slap
in the face.

26:37.166 --> 26:38.291
I'd be angry.

26:38.375 --> 26:40.000
I was barely 25.

26:40.083 --> 26:41.208
Young, foolish.

26:41.291 --> 26:43.875
So you turned to Ray
for some desert lovin'.

26:44.792 --> 26:48.250
Men like Ray were rare.

26:49.166 --> 26:50.667
Special.

26:50.750 --> 26:53.041
What we were doing to them
was wrong.

26:54.583 --> 26:57.041
You fell in love.

26:57.125 --> 26:59.041
No.

26:59.125 --> 27:01.834
We had that one kiss,
that's all.

27:01.917 --> 27:05.125
He said his wife was the only
woman he could ever love.

27:05.208 --> 27:06.333
(Miller)
'Rejection like that?'

27:06.417 --> 27:07.667
Gotta hurt.

27:07.750 --> 27:10.542
Of course I was angry.

27:10.625 --> 27:14.125
Ray told her I was
the only woman he could love.

27:14.208 --> 27:15.375
And you believed him?

27:15.458 --> 27:17.583
Ray was a gentleman.

27:17.667 --> 27:19.709
We never spoke of it again.

27:19.792 --> 27:21.625
His wife find out about it?

27:23.542 --> 27:26.542
I didn't realize
my one, small indiscretion

27:26.625 --> 27:28.417
would destroy his family.

27:35.792 --> 27:37.083
Takahashi.

27:43.834 --> 27:45.834
Billy! Billy!

27:45.917 --> 27:47.959
- What are you doing?
- Joining up.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.834
You were just going to
leave
without saying good-bye?

27:49.917 --> 27:50.959
Not even to your mother?

27:51.041 --> 27:52.333
I said good-bye to her.

27:52.417 --> 27:55.000
What about me?

27:55.083 --> 27:56.417
You?

27:56.500 --> 27:58.917
You talk about being American

27:59.000 --> 28:00.959
about liberty and truth

28:01.041 --> 28:02.500
but you're
the biggest liar here.

28:02.583 --> 28:04.125
What are you
talking
about?

28:04.208 --> 28:06.083
You and that schoolteacher.

28:06.166 --> 28:07.875
- Everyone knows.
- You don't understand.

28:07.959 --> 28:09.166
What?

28:09.250 --> 28:10.583
Things aren't so simple now?

28:10.667 --> 28:11.875
Is that your excuse
for mom, too?

28:11.959 --> 28:13.583
You wanna be
a soldier,
fine

28:13.667 --> 28:14.875
but do it for
the right
reasons.

28:14.959 --> 28:17.417
- This isn't about me.
- Sure it is.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.417
It's about taking
a bullet for a country

28:19.500 --> 28:21.375
<i>you</i>
into a coward

28:21.458 --> 28:23.834
that's called me a Jap
since I can remember.

28:25.625 --> 28:27.041
You don't know what it's like.

28:27.125 --> 28:28.542
Don't I?

28:28.625 --> 28:31.125
I've been called
every name in the
book

28:31.208 --> 28:34.375
treated like dirt and
had
to smile in the face
of it.

28:34.458 --> 28:36.542
'But I never let
that destroy me'

28:36.625 --> 28:38.000
'make me run away.'

28:38.083 --> 28:40.625
Like you are now, son.

28:40.709 --> 28:43.166
Don't go, not like this.

28:46.041 --> 28:47.417
Too late.

28:50.125 --> 28:51.250
Billy!

28:51.333 --> 28:52.792
Billy!

28:52.875 --> 28:55.750
You do not walk away
from me, damn it!

28:58.542 --> 29:00.917
I want..

29:01.000 --> 29:03.667
I want you to..

29:03.750 --> 29:07.125
I want..

29:07.208 --> 29:09.166
I want you
to come home safe, son.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.667
Home?

29:14.750 --> 29:17.458
I don't have a home.

29:17.542 --> 29:18.792
Not anymore.

29:38.291 --> 29:41.625
We got the news about Billy
a few months later.

29:41.709 --> 29:43.709
They never got a chance
to make peace.

29:46.375 --> 29:47.959
(Mary)
'But I made sure
that Ray took me up'

29:48.041 --> 29:50.417
on the offer of the
job
and the apartment.

29:50.500 --> 29:51.834
That was the
least
I could do.

29:51.917 --> 29:55.208
Because you were the reason
Billy enlisted?

29:55.291 --> 29:59.417
You got your apartment
because
of Mary Anne's...generosity?

29:59.500 --> 30:02.750
If leaving that hell meant
taking advantage of a crush

30:02.834 --> 30:06.166
some silly woman had
on my husband, then so be it.

30:06.250 --> 30:09.000
Any mother would have done
the same.

30:09.083 --> 30:11.792
For Barbara?

30:11.875 --> 30:13.709
And for my son.

30:15.875 --> 30:18.917
I wanted him to come home
to a real home.

30:21.709 --> 30:24.291
Not one behind bars.

30:25.125 --> 30:28.417
But he never got that chance.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.375
And we'll leave
on a big train.

30:30.458 --> 30:31.959
And you'll get
to feel cool air

30:32.041 --> 30:34.917
instead of this dusty,
cold wind.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.834
(Ray)
'Train will be here soon.'

30:47.041 --> 30:49.208
I stopped by
the woodworking hut.

30:52.625 --> 30:55.250
I've been..

30:55.333 --> 30:57.250
I've been making
these for you.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.709
'To replace what we had.'

30:59.792 --> 31:02.667
Plus the next time you get
mad at me, they won't break.

31:04.959 --> 31:08.125
I guess it's time
for the backup plan.

31:08.208 --> 31:09.542
Don't give up?

31:09.625 --> 31:11.625
Don't give up..

31:11.709 --> 31:13.000
...on us.

31:14.709 --> 31:16.625
You're my whole life.

31:18.041 --> 31:20.583
You're the only thing
that kept me going here.

31:25.917 --> 31:27.834
We'll use them
in Philadelphia.

31:27.917 --> 31:29.291
In our new home

31:29.375 --> 31:30.917
when Billy returns.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.333
The four of us.

31:33.417 --> 31:34.834
The four of us.

31:37.875 --> 31:39.625
I like the sound of that.

31:41.583 --> 31:43.458
It's time to go.

32:12.625 --> 32:13.834
(Evelyn)
'Ray, what is it?'

32:26.000 --> 32:27.834
Ray?

32:29.917 --> 32:31.583
'Ray?'

32:42.959 --> 32:45.750
<i>(Evelyn)</i>
<i>That's how they told us</i>
<i>our son was dead.</i>

32:48.041 --> 32:49.375
In a telegram.

32:53.542 --> 32:54.834
I'm sorry.

32:57.375 --> 33:01.375
It breaks my heart that Ray and
Billy died angry at each other.

33:04.625 --> 33:06.125
It broke Ray's, too.

33:09.458 --> 33:13.208
We weren't the only family
that got a telegram that day.

33:13.291 --> 33:15.375
Shinji's family got one.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.458
Shinji Nakamura?

33:22.542 --> 33:24.583
The neighbor who
went to Tule
Lake?

33:24.667 --> 33:26.291
His son was in the Army?

33:26.375 --> 33:29.083
One of the first to enlist.

33:29.166 --> 33:31.834
Ray talked him into it.

33:34.667 --> 33:37.583
Finally got Shinji's
Tule Lake records.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.208
- Alibi check out?
- Nope.

33:39.291 --> 33:42.000
Shinji wasn't released in 1946
like he said.

33:42.083 --> 33:45.709
Got out on November 23, 1945.

33:45.792 --> 33:46.959
Few days before Ray was killed.

33:47.041 --> 33:48.625
Even better, he used
the train ticket

33:48.709 --> 33:50.750
the government bought him
to head to Philly

33:50.834 --> 33:52.458
but his wife was in California.

33:52.542 --> 33:56.542
And you don't travel 3,000
miles
just to say hello.

34:01.667 --> 34:03.083
(Vera)
'"You'll have
blood on your hands'

34:03.166 --> 34:05.375
convincing our boys to fight.
This isn't over."

34:05.458 --> 34:07.917
Wasn't just any blood Ray had
on
his hands. It was your son's.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.458
My son would've done anything
to prove he was American.

34:11.542 --> 34:12.709
He got his wish.

34:12.792 --> 34:14.125
That doesn't change
the fact that you were

34:14.208 --> 34:15.959
in Philadelphia
when Ray was murdered.

34:16.041 --> 34:19.041
See, we make good
on our threats, too.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.625
'Checked the records
at Tule Lake.'

34:20.709 --> 34:23.083
Twenty five bucks
and a ticket to Philly.

34:27.542 --> 34:28.792
I came here to see Ray

34:28.875 --> 34:29.959
but I didn't kill him.

34:30.041 --> 34:32.625
Then why lie?

34:32.709 --> 34:34.625
Frankly, not a lot of faith

34:34.709 --> 34:36.125
in the American justice system.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.333
Point taken. Doesn't
answer the question.

34:38.417 --> 34:40.375
I came here to give
him Billy's letter.

34:40.458 --> 34:42.834
'They were long gone when
the letter came to Manzanar.'

34:42.917 --> 34:45.125
Didn't realize
you two were bosom buddies.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.375
We weren't.

34:46.458 --> 34:47.834
But Ray paid the same price

34:47.917 --> 34:49.291
I did to this country..

34:51.291 --> 34:52.458
...a son.

34:57.917 --> 34:59.792
He deserved to have that letter.

35:01.417 --> 35:02.959
And I had a question to ask him.

35:03.041 --> 35:04.333
What question?

35:08.625 --> 35:10.417
"How to go on?"

35:13.250 --> 35:14.834
'But it was clear'

35:14.917 --> 35:17.417
he no longer had
any answers for me.

35:30.834 --> 35:32.083
Ray?

35:34.458 --> 35:35.917
What are you
doing here?

35:39.166 --> 35:41.834
(Shinji)
'This letter came
to Manzanar after you left.'

35:41.917 --> 35:43.959
My wife wanted
to make sure you got it.

35:45.959 --> 35:48.125
I don't want
anything
from that place.

35:50.208 --> 35:51.542
It's from Billy.

35:53.917 --> 35:55.500
Billy's gone.

36:01.041 --> 36:04.375
(Shinji)
'They're saying they can't
send my boy's body home'

36:04.458 --> 36:06.709
for at least another year.

36:06.792 --> 36:09.208
Do you know what I'd do
for a letter?

36:09.291 --> 36:12.625
(Shinji)
Anything from him?

36:12.709 --> 36:14.125
(Ray)
'They already tore it down.'

36:15.834 --> 36:17.875
The camp.

36:17.959 --> 36:19.875
Like it never existed.

36:22.041 --> 36:23.709
My son died for a country

36:23.792 --> 36:27.417
that tosses out its sins
like the kitchen garbage.

36:27.500 --> 36:30.166
I'm surprised they even
remember our boys' names.

36:39.208 --> 36:41.542
They were heroes.

36:41.625 --> 36:42.750
And this country

36:42.834 --> 36:46.208
should give our boys
the medals they deserve.

36:48.917 --> 36:51.125
Can they bring him
back
to me, Shinji?

36:53.542 --> 36:55.291
Can they do that?

37:20.041 --> 37:21.917
Shinji, wait.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.458
Shinji!

37:25.417 --> 37:28.792
He said he was
going
to get Billy his
medal.

37:28.875 --> 37:30.959
He changed his mind
just like that?

37:31.041 --> 37:33.667
After he read Billy's letter.

37:33.750 --> 37:36.625
That's why he was
outside the stadium.

37:36.709 --> 37:37.625
Army/Navy game.

37:37.709 --> 37:39.000
They were giving out the..

37:39.083 --> 37:41.083
...Distinguished Combat Medals
that night.

37:42.917 --> 37:44.583
Billy deserved a medal.

37:48.542 --> 37:50.500
Your son did, too.

37:56.083 --> 37:57.208
Threw himself
on a grenade

37:57.291 --> 37:59.166
to save a
white
battalion.

37:59.250 --> 38:00.625
What a brave kid.

38:00.709 --> 38:05.542
And Dad's last wish was
to see him honored for
it.

38:05.625 --> 38:08.250
Isn't this is
who
we speak for?

38:08.333 --> 38:11.208
People like Billy, Ray?

38:13.208 --> 38:15.500
Sure you can walk away
from them, boss?

38:23.834 --> 38:25.709
If Ray wanted his son
to get that medal

38:25.792 --> 38:28.875
he'd need a nomination
from his commanding officer.

38:28.959 --> 38:30.583
Billy's friend Skip.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.041
He was at the Army-Navy
game that night.

38:38.667 --> 38:40.000
France. Italy.

38:40.083 --> 38:41.917
The South Pacific.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.458
Two Bronze Stars
and a Purple Heart.

38:47.625 --> 38:49.291
You were quite
the soldier, Skip.

38:51.125 --> 38:52.583
Call me Eugene now.

38:54.417 --> 38:56.083
I served in Vietnam myself.

38:57.625 --> 38:59.417
Then you had it worse
than we did.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.041
'War is war, right?'

39:02.125 --> 39:04.250
I had a buddy in 'Nam,
Manny Isoy.

39:04.333 --> 39:06.667
Filipino guy.

39:06.750 --> 39:08.333
Here we were fighting off
the Viet-cong

39:08.417 --> 39:10.583
and I'm stuck with a guy
who looked just like the
enemy.

39:10.667 --> 39:13.667
What are the odds, huh?

39:13.750 --> 39:15.625
A soldier's a soldier.

39:15.709 --> 39:17.083
Manny proved himself to be.

39:17.166 --> 39:19.750
He died saving another guy
in our unit.

39:19.834 --> 39:21.667
A hero.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.125
(Stillman)
'Once we were on patrol we'

39:23.208 --> 39:26.041
got caught in an ambush.

39:26.125 --> 39:28.250
He got tore up pretty bad.

39:28.333 --> 39:29.417
When the smoke cleared

39:29.500 --> 39:31.917
I saw this gook
running towards me.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.542
I came this close
to killing him.

39:36.500 --> 39:37.917
But it was Manny.

39:38.041 --> 39:40.417
Why are you telling me this?

39:40.500 --> 39:41.917
Billy was your best friend.

39:44.417 --> 39:47.000
Yes, he was.

39:47.083 --> 39:48.458
A first-rate guy.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.250
So what happened?

39:55.333 --> 39:57.333
'When he died, you were shipped
to the South Pacific.'

39:57.417 --> 39:59.166
You saw kamikazes
ruin your ships

39:59.250 --> 40:01.125
'POW camps ruin
your friends.'

40:01.208 --> 40:02.417
I get it, Eugene.
Believe me--

40:02.500 --> 40:03.875
There's nothing to get.

40:07.208 --> 40:09.834
They want you to
come back to this
world

40:09.917 --> 40:11.709
and be the same
as when you
left.

40:11.792 --> 40:13.875
But you're not.

40:13.959 --> 40:16.959
Ray Takahashi appealed to Skip

40:17.041 --> 40:19.667
the boy he knew
in California

40:19.750 --> 40:21.041
but Skip was gone.

40:29.083 --> 40:32.250
Fighting for your
life
every day.

40:34.083 --> 40:35.917
You-You know
they're out
there.

40:37.166 --> 40:39.500
And those faces... hating you.

40:39.583 --> 40:41.375
Faces that looked
like Billy and like Ray?

40:41.458 --> 40:44.542
That's why they put
them
in these camps!

40:45.959 --> 40:47.834
They didn't deserve medals.

40:47.917 --> 40:49.208
They were the enemy.

41:04.208 --> 41:05.417
(Ray)
'Skip!'

41:12.625 --> 41:14.500
Go on. I'll just
catch up
with you guys later.

41:20.166 --> 41:22.583
- I need to talk to you.
- Can't.

41:22.667 --> 41:24.083
Shipping back out tomorrow.

41:25.959 --> 41:27.125
It's about Billy.

41:27.208 --> 41:28.709
He deserves the Distinguished
Combat Medal--

41:28.792 --> 41:32.125
Those medals are
for American
heroes.

41:32.208 --> 41:33.875
That's what he was,
and you know it.

41:33.959 --> 41:35.709
Billy sacrificed himself
to save others.

41:35.792 --> 41:39.041
<i>you</i>
people do, isn't
it?

41:39.125 --> 41:40.041
Kamikazes.

41:40.125 --> 41:41.125
Suicide missions.

41:41.208 --> 41:42.667
- Skip--
- Kill yourselves.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.375
And you take good,
innocent people with
you.

41:45.458 --> 41:46.959
A Jap's a Jap.

41:49.458 --> 41:52.041
What happened
to you over there?

41:52.125 --> 41:55.709
Why send this letter if you
didn't care about us anymore?

41:55.792 --> 41:56.792
Read this.

41:56.875 --> 41:59.250
Read this and tell me
it's a lie.

41:59.333 --> 42:00.709
Stop.

42:00.792 --> 42:02.333
- Tell me those boys
weren't--
- Stop!

42:02.417 --> 42:04.000
That Billy doesn't
deserve that medal.

42:04.083 --> 42:06.417
Go home, Jap.

42:06.500 --> 42:08.166
I am home.

42:08.250 --> 42:09.208
My boy was more

42:09.291 --> 42:11.083
of an American
than you'll ever be.

42:31.667 --> 42:33.041
<i>(Billy)</i>

42:36.667 --> 42:38.542
