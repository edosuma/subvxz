23:10.622 --> 23:13.624
that had appeared
on some blinds in there,

23:13.626 --> 23:16.002
and we had no source
for that material.

23:16.004 --> 23:17.628
We left the room.

23:17.630 --> 23:20.673
First, we photographed it
and documented it.

23:20.675 --> 23:22.675
And then I wiped down
the blinds.

23:22.677 --> 23:24.176
And then we sealed the room,

23:24.178 --> 23:27.304
and I thought,
if the grandmother

23:27.306 --> 23:29.639
had went in there
and introduced the oil,

23:29.641 --> 23:32.935
I wanted to make sure that she
didn't go in the second time.

23:32.937 --> 23:34.436
So we stuck a Q-tip
in the door,

23:34.438 --> 23:36.147
at the bottom of the door,

23:36.149 --> 23:37.607
and then we came back
about 40 minutes later,

23:37.609 --> 23:39.442
after Father Maginot
had blessed the house.

23:39.444 --> 23:41.069
And the Q-tip
was still in the door.

23:41.071 --> 23:43.362
We went in, and the blinds
were dripping oil again.

23:43.364 --> 23:45.322
Lieutenant Gruszka
went outside,

23:45.324 --> 23:47.908
and we shined flashlights
on the outside of the window

23:47.910 --> 23:49.494
to see if it was coming in

23:49.496 --> 23:51.161
from the outside
or from the ceiling,

23:51.163 --> 23:54.291
and we could never determine
the source of that.

23:57.169 --> 24:00.170
This CPS worker would be
the next to fall victim

24:00.172 --> 24:03.131
to the malevolent energy
in this home.

24:03.133 --> 24:05.301
The CPS opened the cabinet,

24:05.303 --> 24:07.261
and she took her left hand,
I remember.

24:07.263 --> 24:08.596
She may be left-handed.

24:08.598 --> 24:10.389
And she touched the dripping.

24:10.391 --> 24:12.058
- The fluid...
- The fluid.

24:12.060 --> 24:13.892
- That you'd been seeing.
- Right, right.

24:13.894 --> 24:15.520
And when she touched
the fluid,

24:15.522 --> 24:17.647
a whole half of her hand
changed

24:17.649 --> 24:19.564
like all the blood
had been drawn out of it.

24:19.566 --> 24:20.649
It went white?

24:20.651 --> 24:21.859
White.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.653
It was just completely white.

24:23.655 --> 24:27.490
And she had to leave the house.

24:27.492 --> 24:29.742
She had complained
of pain in that,

24:29.744 --> 24:32.411
and it did turn white.

24:32.413 --> 24:34.121
I went on the investigation,
like I said,

24:34.123 --> 24:37.082
at the very beginning,
thinking that it was a hoax.

24:37.084 --> 24:38.751
The more investigation we did,

24:38.753 --> 24:41.253
I believe
that there's something there.

24:41.255 --> 24:42.754
There's just too many people

24:42.756 --> 24:45.675

are truthful people

24:45.677 --> 24:49.219

some of them which I saw,

24:49.221 --> 24:50.804

24:50.806 --> 24:54.224
I was talking to the Child
Protective Services worker.

24:54.226 --> 24:56.727
Her hand was starting
to come back to life.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.311
Okay.

24:58.313 --> 25:03.525
And Father Maginot came to
the front porch stairs outside,

25:03.527 --> 25:06.821
and he stood there,
and he looked.

25:06.823 --> 25:08.740
I say, "Father, what's wrong?"

25:08.742 --> 25:12.869
And he looked exactly
like the CPS worker's hand.

25:12.871 --> 25:15.996
He was flush
as a sheet of paper.

25:15.998 --> 25:17.749
And it was like...

25:17.751 --> 25:19.375
I said, "What's wrong?"

25:19.377 --> 25:22.589
And he said,
"The blinds are dripping."

original owners.

30:14.922 --> 30:18.006
There, I learned that other
members of the Ammons family

30:18.008 --> 30:21.218
also took issue with
the claims they were making.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.678
Charles has got me

It says the grandmother
of the possessed kids

30:32.023 --> 30:34.732
insists none of this went on.

30:34.734 --> 30:37.068
Could this be
the other grandmother?

30:37.070 --> 30:38.069
I don't know.

30:38.071 --> 30:39.070
I read that...

30:39.072 --> 30:40.362
So Latoya Ammons,

30:40.364 --> 30:43.116

that lived in the house,

30:43.118 --> 30:45.118
that witnessed all that stuff

30:45.120 --> 30:47.078
and did all the interviews

30:47.080 --> 30:50.247
stating that she saw the kids
being lifted up

30:50.249 --> 30:52.332
and tons of other stuff.

30:52.334 --> 30:55.461
So now Latoya Ammons's
step-mother,

30:55.463 --> 30:57.129
which is a different woman:

30:57.131 --> 31:00.090
"My children,
Latoya's brother and sisters,

31:00.092 --> 31:03.093
are outraged,"
the step-mother told me.

31:03.095 --> 31:05.138
They know the true story,
and they're upset

31:05.140 --> 31:08.014
about the family's name
being dragged through the mud.

31:08.016 --> 31:11.101
"My family hoped
this would all blow over.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.853
It has not."

31:12.855 --> 31:13.855

of a ghostly figure

31:20.321 --> 31:22.405

31:22.407 --> 31:28.035
But this was almost definitely
faked using a cell phone app.

31:28.037 --> 31:30.955
On top of this,
I had the house inspected,

31:30.957 --> 31:32.999
and the inspector found mold
and other things

31:33.001 --> 31:35.542
that could have had
a psychological effect

31:35.544 --> 31:37.211
on the residents.

31:37.213 --> 31:40.048
So what does the house contain?

31:40.050 --> 31:42.802
Asbestos, black mold,
everything?

32:02.947 --> 32:07.369
Can that make you feel dizzy
or euphoric?

32:09.120 --> 32:10.535
And then you have
to think about, too,

32:10.537 --> 32:12.038
if any of those elements

32:12.040 --> 32:16.667
would affect the human mind
or the body

32:16.669 --> 32:18.794
to perceive those side effects

32:18.796 --> 32:23.299
as paranormal-induced type

32:23.301 --> 32:26.676
euphoria and spirit energy.

32:26.678 --> 32:32.641
So it's something to take
into consideration.

32:32.643 --> 32:34.435
I was starting to think
this may be

32:34.437 --> 32:37.146
an overblown case
of mass hysteria

32:37.148 --> 32:40.065
or that there was some other
normal explanation

32:40.067 --> 32:43.276
that was now being turned
into a money grab.

32:43.278 --> 32:46.697

with my own investigation,

32:46.699 --> 32:48.742

live there in the '90s.

33:06.177 --> 33:08.093

did have three kids also.
