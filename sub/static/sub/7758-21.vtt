00:51.785 --> 00:53.787
AT KENNEDY AND COLLINS
WHERE I WORK IN NEW YORK,

00:53.821 --> 00:56.090
WE HAVE THIS SAYING:

00:56.124 --> 00:58.426
"THE ONLY THING BETTER
THAN GREAT SEX

00:58.459 --> 01:00.494
IS A GREAT AD CAMPAIGN."

01:00.528 --> 01:03.164
SO WHEN I WAS ASKED TO COME
TO PITTSBURGH

01:03.197 --> 01:05.433
TO HELP CHOOSE THE AD PERSON
OF THE YEAR,

01:05.466 --> 01:07.668
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR
WAS SOMEONE

01:07.701 --> 01:08.869
WHO COULD GIVE GREAT AD.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.306
SOMEONE WHOSE WORK WOULD MAKE ME
STAND UP AND TAKE NOTICE.

01:12.340 --> 01:16.310
WELL, AFTER REVIEWING
THIS YEAR'S ENTRIES,

01:16.344 --> 01:18.712
I BELIEVE WE FOUND HIM.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.448
THIS YEAR'S ATLAS AWARD

01:20.481 --> 01:24.852
FOR PITTSBURGH'S AD PERSON

GO AND GET HIM, TIGER.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.360

[applause continues,

01:35.396 --> 01:38.232
*

01:38.266 --> 01:42.670
- * AND I WANT TO GO
TO NEW YORK CITY *

01:42.703 --> 01:45.306
* 'CAUSE THEY TELL ME
IT'S THE PLACE TO BE *

01:45.339 --> 01:48.442
- YEAH!

01:48.476 --> 01:50.744
- CARE TO TEST THAT SAYING?

01:50.778 --> 01:55.716
- * I JUST KNOW
THAT IT'S THE PLACE FOR ME *

01:55.749 --> 01:58.486
[indistinct chatter]

01:58.519 --> 02:07.761
*

02:07.795 --> 02:10.864
[both moaning]
* I'M GETTING PRETTY TIRED

02:10.898 --> 02:16.170
* OF GOING DOWNTOWN

02:16.204 --> 02:20.241
* YOU KNOW, THE SAME TRIP
EVERY DAY *

02:20.274 --> 02:22.776
* IT'S KIND OF
BRINGING ME DOWN *

02:22.810 --> 02:25.646
- I WAS STANDING THERE
WITH MY DICK OUT,

02:25.679 --> 02:28.649
WHEN THIS GUY AT THE URINAL
NEXT TO ME STARTED CRUISING ME.

02:28.682 --> 02:31.252
- DID YOU CRUISE HIM BACK?
- NO.

02:31.285 --> 02:32.620
- SO YOU DID NOTHING

02:32.653 --> 02:34.255
TO MAKE HIM THINK
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR SEX?

02:34.288 --> 02:35.889
- I JUST WANTED
TO TAKE A PISS.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.825
- SAME THING HAPPENED
TO THIS GUY FROM MY GYM.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.460
HE WAS OUT WALKING HIS DOG,

02:39.493 --> 02:41.529
STARTS TALKING TO SOME GUY,
WHO INVITES HIM BACK

02:41.562 --> 02:42.663
TO HIS PLACE.
- THANK YOU.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.265
- NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
HE'S BUSTED.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.299
- THEY CAN REALLY DO THAT?

02:45.333 --> 02:46.734
- OH, THEY CAN DO
WHATEVER THE HELL THEY WANT.

02:46.767 --> 02:47.901
- FUCK THAT.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.770
BETTER FIGHT IT.
- HEY!

02:49.803 --> 02:51.672
YOU DON'T PUT ANY IDEAS
IN HIS HEAD.

02:51.705 --> 02:52.606
- YOU WANTED ME TO FIGHT

02:52.640 --> 02:53.907
FOR THE GAY-STRAIGHT ALLIANCE
AT SCHOOL.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.309
- THIS IS DIFFERENT.

02:55.343 --> 02:57.278
YOU'RE 18,
AND YOU'RE HEALTHY.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.679
WHAT ARE OUR OTHER OPTIONS?

02:58.712 --> 03:02.350
TO PLEAD GUILTY.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.884
- WOULD HE HAVE
TO GO TO JAIL?

03:03.917 --> 03:05.319
- NO, NOT
FOR A FIRST OFFENSE.

03:05.353 --> 03:06.354
I MEAN, YOU'D PAY A FINE.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.256
- I'LL TAKE IT.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.990
PAY THE $2
AND BE DONE WITH IT.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.460
- AND IT WILL BE ON YOUR RECORD.
PERMANENTLY.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.328
- WHAT, YOU MEAN
AS A SEX OFFENDER?

03:14.362 --> 03:15.629
- OH, WILL THEY
MAKE HIM REGISTER

03:15.663 --> 03:16.830
WITH THE POLICE
AND EVERYTHING?

03:16.864 --> 03:18.632
- YEAH, THEY WILL.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.368
- JESUS.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.602
- WELL...

03:21.635 --> 03:23.637
THERE GOES MY SHOT
AT THE SUPREME COURT.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.306
- YOU COULD PLEAD
NOT GUILTY.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.574
- ONE MORE WORD OUT OF YOU...

03:26.607 --> 03:27.975
- WELL, THAT WOULD
INVOLVE GOING TO TRIAL.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.010
YOU'D HAVE TO GET UP
IN FRONT OF A JURY,

03:30.043 --> 03:32.012
AND SOME YOUNG,
AGGRESSIVE PROSECUTOR

03:32.045 --> 03:34.515
FROM THE D.A.'S OFFICE
WOULD CROSS-EXAMINE YOU,

03:34.548 --> 03:36.817
THE COP WHO ARRESTED YOU WOULD
BE SITTING IN THE FRONT ROW.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.653
- I CAN'T DO THAT.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.322
- HE CAN'T TAKE
ANY MORE STRESS.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.756
- SO YOU HAVE A MISDEMEANOR
ON YOUR RECORD.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.758
WHO'S GOING TO KNOW?

03:44.792 --> 03:46.327
- HE WILL.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.799
- SO WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
IN PITTSBURGH?

03:51.832 --> 03:52.866
- WHAT?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.735
- YOU'RE TOO GOOD
FOR PITTSBURGH.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.770
YOU SHOULD BE IN NEW YORK.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.472
- YEAH,
BUT FOR WHAT I PAY HERE,

03:58.506 --> 04:01.775
I HAVE A LOFT THE SIZE
OF A CITY BLOCK.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.577
AND THERE, I'D HAVE
A CLOSET IN QUEENS.

04:03.611 --> 04:04.778
- WOULDN'T BELIEVE
THE SALARIES

04:04.812 --> 04:06.614
THEY'RE PAYING IN THE CITY
THESE DAYS.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.948
I'M 27.

04:07.981 --> 04:11.885
I JUST BOUGHT
AN AMAZING DUPLEX IN SOHO.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.988
- WOW, SO...
WE'RE THE SAME AGE.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.591
- YOU KNOW, IN FACT,
THERE'S AN OPENING AT MY AGENCY.

04:17.625 --> 04:18.726
AT YOUR LEVEL.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.328
AND YOU CLEARLY
GOT EXPERIENCE,

04:20.361 --> 04:22.062
AND YOU'RE AN AWARD WINNER.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.497
[chuckles]

04:23.531 --> 04:27.267
I'D BE HAPPY TO PUT IN
A GOOD WORD FOR YOU.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.775
- IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU'D BE...HAPPY TO DO?

04:34.808 --> 04:36.944
[unzips pants]

04:47.355 --> 04:49.957
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SITTING IN THE DARK?

04:49.990 --> 04:50.958
- THINKING.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.393
HOW'S VIC?

04:52.426 --> 04:55.896
- OKAY, CONSIDERING
HE JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL.

05:00.601 --> 05:01.702
- I GOT A CALL FROM LORI.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.003
- OH, YEAH?

05:03.036 --> 05:05.573
- SHE AND GARY
ARE GETTING A DIVORCE.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.974
- THAT'S TOO BAD.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.342
YOU KNOW,
THESE STRAIGHT COUPLES

05:08.376 --> 05:11.412
CANNOT MAKE
THEIR MARRIAGES WORK.

05:11.445 --> 05:14.648
- HANK'S PRETTY UPSET.

05:14.682 --> 05:18.686
- WELL, YEAH,
I GUESS HE MUST BE.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.053
- SHE SAID HE'S NOT SPEAKING
TO HER,

05:20.087 --> 05:22.956
HE'S DITCHING CLASS,
HIS GRADES STINK,

05:22.990 --> 05:24.392
HE'S EVEN QUIT
THE HOCKEY TEAM.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.826
- HE'S NOT DOING DRUGS,
IS HE?

05:25.859 --> 05:30.698
- NO, SHE DOESN'T THINK SO.
HE'S JUST FUCKING ANGRY.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.666
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF ME.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.701
- DID HE SAY THAT?

05:33.734 --> 05:36.970
- NO, I DID.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.508
THIS'LL MAKE THE SECOND DAD
THAT HE'S LOST.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.614
- SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

05:46.647 --> 05:47.981
- THE PLAN?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.517
- WELL, A REAL TRIP
WOULD ACCOMPLISH

05:49.550 --> 05:50.651
A LOT MORE
THAN A GUILT TRIP.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.952
SHOULD I MAKE
A RESERVATION?

05:51.985 --> 05:56.490
- I ALREADY DID.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.392
THERE'S A RED-EYE
OUT OF CHICAGO WITH A CONNECTION

05:58.426 --> 06:01.729
THAT'LL PUT ME IN PORTLAND
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.932
I FIGURE THE SOONER
I GET THERE...

06:04.965 --> 06:08.469
- WELL, WHO SAYS
YOU'RE NOT A GREAT DAD?

06:08.502 --> 06:10.471
DROPPING EVERYTHING
AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE

06:10.504 --> 06:15.075
TO FLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY
TO BE WITH YOUR KID.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.510
SO WHEN'LL YOU BE BACK?

06:16.544 --> 06:20.147
- SOON AS I CAN.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.816
- THIS'LL BE THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE BEEN APART.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.752
- YEAH.

06:26.820 --> 06:30.057
- IT'S GONNA BE WEIRD,
YOU NOT BEING HERE.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.827
PROMISE ME
YOU'LL MISS ME?

06:33.861 --> 06:36.630
- [chuckles]
- A LOT?

06:46.574 --> 06:48.542
- AH, IF YOU SEE ANYTHING
IN THERE FOR AN ACCOUNTANT

06:48.576 --> 06:50.911
THAT INCLUDES WORLD TRAVEL AND
AN UNLIMITED EXPENSE ACCOUNT,

06:50.944 --> 06:52.112
LET ME KNOW.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.815
- FIRST I HAVE TO FIND
A JOB FOR MYSELF.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.717
- ANY POSSIBILITIES?

06:56.750 --> 06:59.086
- SURE, BUT THEY ALL
WANT TRAINING,

06:59.119 --> 07:00.788
EXPERIENCE, REFERENCES.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.556
WHO'S GOING TO HIRE
A CRYSTAL FREAK?

07:02.590 --> 07:04.925
- FORMER CRYSTAL FREAK.
- TWO? RIGHT THIS WAY.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.927
- [scoffs]
- GIVE YOURSELF A LITTLE CREDIT

07:06.960 --> 07:09.029
FOR ALL THE POSITIVE STEPS
YOU'VE BEEN TAKING, OKAY?

07:09.062 --> 07:10.998
- THANKS TO YOU.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.803
- HELLO, YOUNG LOVERS.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.204
[imitates gagging]

07:17.237 --> 07:20.073
[scoffs]

07:20.107 --> 07:23.210
- THERE'S THE GUYS,
COME ON.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.745
- TED SCHMIDT,

07:24.778 --> 07:26.547
HAPPY AT LAST.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.115
IT'S FUCKING UNBELIEVABLE.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.282
- YEAH,
WHO WOULD'VE GUESSED?

07:29.316 --> 07:31.685
- YEAH, COULD YOU JUST KEEP
THE PASSION TO A MINIMUM?

07:31.719 --> 07:35.556
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND OUT OF TOWN
AND NO MEANS FOR RELEASE.

07:35.589 --> 07:38.158
- HAVE YOU GUYS
SEEN THE NEW WAITER?

07:41.862 --> 07:43.096
- YOWZA!

07:43.130 --> 07:44.131
- YOU CALL THAT HOT?

07:44.164 --> 07:45.599
- [chuckles] YEAH.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.234
- AT YOUR AGE,
I GUESS YOU WOULD.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.102
- OH, AT YOUR AGE,
YOU WOULDN'T?

07:49.136 --> 07:50.270
- I'VE MOVED BEYOND THAT.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.972
[all laugh]
- SINCE WHEN?

07:52.005 --> 07:53.240
- SINCE LAST NIGHT.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.142
I DID THE HOTTEST GUY...

07:55.175 --> 07:57.277
- [scoffs]
- IN DAYS.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.146
- HE'S AN AD EXEC
FROM NEW YORK.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.648
HE SAID I'M TOO GOOD
FOR PITTSBURGH

08:00.681 --> 08:01.615
AND THAT I'M WASTING
MY TIME HERE.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.083
HE THINKS
I SHOULD BE THERE.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.652
- I BET HE SAYS THAT
TO ALL THE BOYS.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.087
- HE SAID...
THERE'S A JOB AT HIS AGENCY

08:07.120 --> 08:10.591
THAT I'D BE PERFECT FOR.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.693
I FAXED HIM MY RESUME.

08:12.726 --> 08:13.861
- YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.228
- YOU DON'T THINK SO?

08:15.262 --> 08:16.764
- SO IF YOU GET THIS JOB,
YOU'RE LEAVING?

08:16.797 --> 08:18.932
- NOT "IF," "WHEN."

08:18.966 --> 08:21.234
[indistinct
background chatter]

08:29.877 --> 08:31.612
- YOU THINK
HE REALLY MEANT IT?

08:31.645 --> 08:33.280
HE'S REALLY GOING TO GO?

08:33.313 --> 08:35.549
- WELL...
OF COURSE NOT.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.551
HE'S PROBABLY JUST BOASTING
'CAUSE SOME BIG SHOT

08:37.585 --> 08:39.587
FROM NEW YORK
IS COMPLIMENTING HIM.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.655
- AND THE BRIGHT LIGHTS
OF BROADWAY BECKON.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.724
- I DON'T KNOW,
HE SOUNDED PRETTY SERIOUS.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.092
HE EVEN SENT HIM
HIS RESUME.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.960
- YOU KNOW WHERE THAT'S
GOING TO END UP, DON'T YOU?

08:46.994 --> 08:49.129
ON THE BOTTOM OF SOME PILE.
MINE ALWAYS DO.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.264
- YEAH, PROBABLY
A THOUSAND OTHER GUYS

08:51.298 --> 08:52.265
CLAMORING
FOR THE VERY SAME JOB.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.667
- NO, TRUST ME,

08:53.701 --> 08:54.968
HE'S NEVER GOING
TO HEAR FROM THEM AGAIN.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.236
[cell phone rings]
OH...SHOOT, THERE'S A CALL.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.605
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TALK
TO YOU GUYS LATER.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.272
- OKAY.
- BYE.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.273
SO WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THAT WHOLE VIC THING?

09:00.307 --> 09:01.675
- YEAH?

09:01.709 --> 09:03.043
- YOU CALLED?

09:03.076 --> 09:04.978
- YEAH, THANKS
FOR RETURNING.

09:05.012 --> 09:08.281
LISTEN, BLAKE IS LOOKING
FOR A JOB,

09:08.315 --> 09:10.050
AND HE'S INTERESTED
IN BECOMING A PARALEGAL.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.351
AND I THOUGHT POSSIBLY
YOU MIGHT HAVE AN OPENING

09:11.384 --> 09:12.586
AT YOUR FIRM?

09:12.620 --> 09:14.622
- GOD, YOU ARE SO IN LUCK.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.323
ONE OF OUR ASSISTANTS
JUST QUIT THIS MORNING.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.358
HE COULD START RIGHT AWAY.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.660
- REALLY?

09:19.693 --> 09:21.328
- OF COURSE NOT.
[chuckles]

09:21.361 --> 09:24.197
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
JOBS ARE JUST FALLING OFF TREES?

09:24.231 --> 09:25.332
- ALL RIGHT,
NO NEED TO GET CUNTY.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.433
JUST THOUGHT I'D ASK.

09:26.466 --> 09:30.037
- THOUGH...HE IS A NICE GUY,
AND HE DID HELP VIC OUT.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.639
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE COULD
TAKE HIM ON AS A TEMP

09:31.672 --> 09:32.773
FOR A COUPLE WEEKS,

09:32.806 --> 09:34.207
SEE HOW HE DOES,
AND FIND HIM A REFERRAL.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.343
- THAT'D BE GREAT.

09:36.376 --> 09:40.714
AND, UH, MEL?
YOU'RE NOT REALLY, YOU KNOW.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.016
- I KNOW, YOU ARE.

09:45.853 --> 09:46.854
- [sighs]

09:46.887 --> 09:48.355
[laughter]

09:48.388 --> 09:49.823
- OH, SHOOT IT.
OH, NICE TRY.

09:49.857 --> 09:51.258
- NICE SHOT.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.393
- OH!
- [laughs]

09:53.426 --> 09:55.729
HERE, I'M OPEN, MAN.
COME ON.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.731
[door squeaks open]

09:57.765 --> 09:59.867
- FOR YOU.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.704
- A PECAN PIE?

10:03.737 --> 10:05.706
- WELL, WHENEVER MY MOTHER
PAID A VISIT,

10:05.739 --> 10:08.108
SHE ALWAYS BROUGHT ALONG
A PECAN PIE.

10:08.141 --> 10:11.011
OF COURSE, THIS ONE'S
FROM THE SUPERMARKET.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.747
SHE BAKED HER OWN.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.784
HER PIES WERE SO...

10:16.817 --> 10:18.686
AWFUL...
YOU KNOW.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.987
NO ONE REALLY NOTICED,
THOUGH,

10:20.020 --> 10:21.922
'CAUSE SHE WAS
SUCH A CHATTERBOX.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.391
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE
CALLED HER, "CHATTERBOX."

10:24.424 --> 10:26.660
I SUPPOSE I'M LIKE HER
IN THAT REGARD.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.261
REAL LITTLE CHATTERBOX.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.698
- I NEVER NOTICED.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.333
- YEAH, WHENEVER ANYTHING WAS
HAPPENING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

10:33.366 --> 10:37.137
YOU COULD ALWAYS COUNT ON ENID
TO BE RIGHT THERE WITH HER PIE.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.340
[chuckles]
SO, UH...

10:40.373 --> 10:42.209
SO IS ANYTHING HAPPENING?

10:42.242 --> 10:45.713
- YEAH, I'M TAKING OUT
THE GARBAGE.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.916
- I MEAN ABOUT
YOUR UPCOMING COURT APPEARANCE.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.154
- I PLAN
TO PLEAD GUILTY.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.323
- PLEASE DON'T.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.992
- LOOK, IT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.828
- NO,
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.963
IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO
WITH ME, WITH ALL OF US.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.898
BECAUSE I-IT COULD HAPPEN
TO ANY OF US.

11:04.932 --> 11:08.168
- WELL, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ANY
OF YOU. IT HAPPENED TO ME.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.170
- BY NOT FIGHTING,
YOU'RE LETTING THEM KNOW

11:10.203 --> 11:12.005
THAT THEY CAN KEEP
GETTING AWAY WITH THIS.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.406
- I'M SICK.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.076
- YOU'RE ALSO INNOCENT.

11:16.109 --> 11:19.312
- WHO GIVES A SHIT?

11:19.346 --> 11:21.214
THE COPS?
THE D.A.?

11:21.248 --> 11:23.116
- I WAS HOPING YOU.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.284
- OR ME.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.086
I JUST WANT IT OVER,

11:26.119 --> 11:29.322
SO I CAN BRING OUT THE TRASH
IN PEACE AND QUIET.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.292
- AS A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.827
- JESUS CHRIST.

11:33.861 --> 11:34.962
DO YOU HAVE
TO BROADCAST IT?

11:34.995 --> 11:37.330
- EVERYONE'S GOING
TO KNOW ANYWAY.

11:37.364 --> 11:41.268
- FINE. THEN I'LL JUST
HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT.

11:44.872 --> 11:48.976
- THAT'S JUST WHAT, UH,
WHAT MR. PETTIGREW SAID.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.811
- WHO?

11:50.844 --> 11:53.213
- MR. PETTIGREW.

11:53.246 --> 11:56.349
A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER BACK HOME
IN HAZELHURST.

11:56.383 --> 12:00.353
HE WAS ACCUSED OF EXPOSING
HIMSELF TO ONE OF HIS STUDENTS.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.489
HE SWORE IT WASN'T TRUE,
THAT THE KID WAS LYING

12:02.522 --> 12:04.457
'CAUSE HE FLUNKED HIM.

12:04.491 --> 12:08.195
- AND I SUPPOSE YOU'RE GOING TO
TELL ME HE WAS BEATEN TO DEATH

12:08.228 --> 12:09.963
OR HUNG HIMSELF
IN HIS JAIL CELL.

12:09.997 --> 12:12.132
- [scoffing]
NO, NO.

12:12.165 --> 12:17.504
NO, HE WENT TO LIVE WITH
HIS SPINSTER SISTER IN MERIDIAN.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.506
WHEN HE DIED
A FEW YEARS LATER,

12:19.539 --> 12:22.209
THEY SAY HE PUT
IN HIS WILL

12:22.242 --> 12:26.814
THAT HE DIDN'T WANT HIS NAME
ON HIS TOMBSTONE...

12:26.847 --> 12:29.316
BECAUSE IT WAS WORTHLESS.

12:41.461 --> 12:42.796
- DON'T GO.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.865
YOU CAN'T GO.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.533
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITHOUT ME?

12:46.566 --> 12:48.201
[chuckles]

12:48.235 --> 12:52.272
- I DON'T KNOW,
I GUESS I'LL SURVIVE.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.542
- DOUBT IT.

12:55.575 --> 12:59.412
[sighs]
WHAT ABOUT ME?

12:59.446 --> 13:02.950
- I'M SURE YOU'LL GET ALONG
JUST FINE ON YOUR OWN.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.952
- NO, I WON'T.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.353
- YEAH, YOU WILL.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.055
- YOU'RE GOING TO DO
WHAT YOU SHOULD'VE DONE

13:08.088 --> 13:09.857
A LONG TIME AGO.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.292
YOU'RE GOING TO MEET
SOME TWINKIE YOUR OWN AGE.

13:12.325 --> 13:15.162
- WHAT DO YOU THINK I WANT WITH
SOME KID WHO DOESN'T KNOW SHIT?

13:18.098 --> 13:20.300
- I NEED TO TAKE A SHOWER.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.935
- GO.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.171
GO TAKE YOUR SHOWER.

13:24.204 --> 13:27.908
GO TO NEW YORK.
GO TO YOUR NEW LIFE.

13:27.941 --> 13:30.410
IN A YEAR,
PROBABLY NOT EVEN THAT LONG...

13:30.443 --> 13:31.644
YOU WON'T EVEN
REMEMBER MY NAME.

13:31.678 --> 13:34.381
"OH, WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT KID
WHO WOULDN'T LEAVE ME ALONE,

13:34.414 --> 13:36.950
WHO THOUGHT HE WAS
IN LOVE WITH ME?"

13:36.984 --> 13:40.287
[scoffs] IF YOU FUCKING
THINK OF ME AT ALL.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.926
- I WON'T.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.997
I WON'T THINK OF YOU.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.099
- [scoffs]

13:54.301 --> 13:56.103
- WHEN I WALK OUT THAT DOOR,

13:56.136 --> 13:59.506
I DON'T PLAN
ON EVER LOOKING BACK.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.212
AND I EXPECT YOU
TO DO THE SAME.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.208
- [sniffling]

14:46.119 --> 14:48.655
- * TRY THIS ON

14:48.688 --> 14:50.590
- IT'S THE PERFECT
INTERVIEW SUIT.

14:50.623 --> 14:51.992
- YOU SURE?

14:52.025 --> 14:54.194
- TRUST YOUR BOYFRIEND.
HE'S GOT A GOOD EYE.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.530
THERE, YOU'RE ALL SET.
SO I'LL GO RING THIS UP.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.100
[soft jazz music]

15:00.133 --> 15:04.271
- * TRY THIS ON
FOR SIZE *

15:04.304 --> 15:06.306
[phone ringing]
- [chuckling]

15:06.339 --> 15:10.710
- * MM-MM-HMM

15:10.743 --> 15:14.014
[phone ringing]

15:14.047 --> 15:17.217
* YEAH,
EVERYTHING IS PERFECT *

15:17.250 --> 15:21.388
*

15:21.421 --> 15:25.558
* SHE FITS YOU RIGHT

15:25.592 --> 15:28.095
*

15:28.128 --> 15:33.166
* WE'LL LET IT OUT

15:33.200 --> 15:35.702
*

15:35.735 --> 15:37.337
- [gasps]

15:37.370 --> 15:39.306
[giggling]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:39.339 --> 15:41.341
- I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU
COULD USE A LITTLE HAND

15:41.374 --> 15:45.278
WITH YOUR PANTS HERE.
- UH, WELL, MM.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.580
I'M A--A BIG BOY AND...
- I'M SURE.

15:47.614 --> 15:51.184
- I CAN DRESS AND...
UNDRESS MYSELF.

15:51.218 --> 15:52.552
- YEAH, BUT ALL THESE PINS.

15:52.585 --> 15:55.388
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
YOU MIGHT GET PRICKED.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.224
- OW!
- SEE?

15:57.257 --> 15:59.192
CAREFUL.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.460
CAREFUL.
- MMM. MM.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.996
- * TRY THIS ON FOR SIZE

16:03.030 --> 16:04.064
*

16:04.097 --> 16:08.435
* LITTLE FELLA

16:08.468 --> 16:10.503
- LET'S GO FOR IT.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.072
- IN HERE?
- [chuckles]

16:12.105 --> 16:14.074
- WHAT IF WE GET CAUGHT?

16:14.107 --> 16:16.576
- THAT'S THE FUN PART.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.079
*

16:19.112 --> 16:22.349
- * SHE FITS YOU RIGHT

16:22.382 --> 16:25.685
*

16:25.718 --> 16:30.457
* WE'LL LET IT OUT

16:30.490 --> 16:34.761
- [panting]

16:34.794 --> 16:38.431
[gasping]

16:38.465 --> 16:41.068
- * COME ON

16:41.101 --> 16:43.570
* COME ON

16:43.603 --> 16:46.073
- [loudly]
YOU DOING OKAY IN THERE?

16:46.106 --> 16:47.674
- UH...
- UH, FINE.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.076
- GREAT!
- THANKS.

16:49.109 --> 16:52.779
HERE, GIVE HER THESE.

16:52.812 --> 16:56.616
- D-DONE WITH THESE.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.218
- [laughs]

16:58.251 --> 17:00.287
- UH, TAKE ALL THE TIME
YOU NEED, BOYS.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.454
- OH, WE WILL.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.522
[both giggle]

17:02.555 --> 17:05.392
- * TRY THIS ONE ON
FOR SIZE *

17:05.425 --> 17:08.195
- [gasping]

17:08.228 --> 17:10.697
- * MM-MM-HMM

17:13.433 --> 17:14.767
[papers rustling]

17:17.804 --> 17:19.806
- THIS IS NOT THE REPORT
I EXPECTED.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.641
I HAVE TO HAVE MY CLIENT...

17:21.674 --> 17:23.410
- TRY AND RELAX.

17:23.443 --> 17:28.148
- I JUST WANT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.417
- OKAY, HERE'S
THE POLICE REPORT.

17:30.450 --> 17:33.153
COP'S GOT LOUSY HANDWRITING,
AND HIS SPELLING'S ATROCIOUS.

17:33.186 --> 17:36.223
SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO CRACK OUT
YOUR READING GLASSES.

17:40.427 --> 17:43.396
- ANOTHER JOY
OF MIDDLE AGE.

17:51.438 --> 17:52.839
THIS ISN'T WHAT HAPPENED.

17:52.872 --> 17:56.109
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:56.143 --> 17:58.711
"THE SUSPECT UNZIPPED HIS PANTS
AND EXPOSED HIMSELF."

17:58.745 --> 18:01.214
GOD, I WAS PEEING.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.416
"SUSPECT BEGAN MASTURBATING
HIS HALF-ERECT PENIS."

18:03.450 --> 18:07.587
I NEVER DID.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.522
"SUSPECT SAID,
'WHAT ARE YOU INTO?'"

18:09.556 --> 18:11.724
I NEVER SAID THAT,
THE COP DID.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.594
- OKAY, ARE YOU SURE?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.796
BECAUSE SOMETIMES
YOU CAN PLAY AN INCIDENT

18:16.829 --> 18:19.199
OVER IN YOUR MIND
SO MANY TIMES,

18:19.232 --> 18:22.469
THAT YOU FORGET
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.737
- I WAS THERE.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.574
I KNOW.
[gavel bangs]

18:27.607 --> 18:30.377
- IN THE MATTER OF THE PEOPLE
VERSUS VICTOR GRASSI,

18:30.410 --> 18:32.612
IS COUNSEL READY
TO ENTER A PLEA?

18:32.645 --> 18:36.216
- YES, YOUR HONOR.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.652
WE PLEAD...

18:39.686 --> 18:41.554
- NOT GUILTY.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.290
- OKAY.
- OH, NOT GUILTY.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.592
[all murmuring]

18:45.625 --> 18:47.794
- THANK YOU, GOD.

18:47.827 --> 18:53.900
[chatter continues]

18:53.933 --> 18:56.169
- YOU PUT ME ON THAT STAND,

18:56.203 --> 18:59.772
I'LL TELL THAT WHOLE COURTROOM
HOW THAT FUCKING COP IS LYING.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.608
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
YOU WILL.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.943
- ONLY IT'LL JUST BE
YOUR WORD AGAINST HIS.

19:03.976 --> 19:07.146
BUT I'LL SEE
WHAT I CAN DIG UP.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.384
- SOUNDS LIKE
THIS COULD GET EXPENSIVE.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.519
- OH, DON'T--
NO, NO, DON'T WORRY.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.387
I'M TAKING THIS CASE
PRO BONO.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.555
- BONO?

19:15.588 --> 19:17.657
LIKE SONNY BONO?

19:17.690 --> 19:19.259
IT MEANS "FOR FREE,"
MOTHER.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.827
- OH, NO FUCKING WAY!

19:20.860 --> 19:21.928
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.196
WE INSIST ON PAYING.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.731
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.799
ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN PAY,
IN BABY-SITTING.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.668
AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING
WATCHING HIM SLEEP.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.737
I'M TALKING CHANGING
HIS HUGGIES, THE WORKS.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.406
- OKAY, WE ACCEPT.
[chuckles]

19:33.440 --> 19:35.542
AND--AND--AND JUSTIN
CAN HELP.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.676
RIGHT, SUNSHINE?

19:36.709 --> 19:39.479
- HMM?
SURE.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.621
I'M GLAD YOU DECIDED
TO FIGHT, VIC.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.461
[sighs]

19:59.266 --> 20:00.433
- [whispering]
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

20:00.467 --> 20:03.236
- BRIAN'S MOVING
TO NEW YORK.

20:03.270 --> 20:06.573
IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD
AS HE KNOWS IT.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.449
- CAN I COME IN?

20:16.483 --> 20:19.218
- IT WAS YOUR ROOM FIRST.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.726
- HE'S NOT MOVING
TO NEW YORK.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.961
- HE'S SURE TALKING
LIKE HE IS.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.563
HE FLEW THIS MORNING
FOR AN INTERVIEW.

20:30.597 --> 20:33.366
- WELL, THERE'S NO HARM
IN TAKING A MEETING.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.869
BESIDES, I'VE KNOWN HIM
A LOT LONGER THAN YOU HAVE.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.572
HE MAY BITCH AND MOAN
ABOUT PITTSBURGH, BUT...

20:39.606 --> 20:41.541
THERE'S NO WAY
HE'D STOP BEING TOP DOG

20:41.574 --> 20:42.775
TO BE ONE OF THE PACK.

20:42.809 --> 20:46.379
- THEN WHY'S HE PUTTING
HIS PLACE UP FOR SALE?

20:46.413 --> 20:48.815
- WHAT?

20:48.848 --> 20:51.784
- HE CALLED
A REAL ESTATE AGENT.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.624
WE SHOULD STOP HIM.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.759
- [scoffs]
YEAH, STOP BRIAN.

20:59.792 --> 21:03.730
RIGHT.
NEXT WE CAN TAKE ON STARBUCKS.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.865
- WELL, WE CAN'T
JUST LET HIM LEAVE.

21:05.898 --> 21:08.901
- WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.703
BESIDES, EVERYONE
HAS THE RIGHT TO DECIDE

21:10.737 --> 21:13.506
HOW THEY WANT
TO LIVE THEIR LIFE.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.976
LOOK AT YOU.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.779
YOU DECIDED TO LEAVE HOME,
AND...

21:19.812 --> 21:22.281
I BET NOTHING
COULD'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND.

21:23.816 --> 21:28.321
IT'S THE SAME
WITH BRIAN.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.089
- I LOVE HIM, MICHAEL.

21:30.122 --> 21:34.961
- I KNOW.

21:34.994 --> 21:39.399
ALL THE MORE REASON
WHY YOU HAVE TO LET HIM GO.

21:39.432 --> 21:40.733
- JUST LIKE THAT?

21:40.767 --> 21:44.671
- YEAH, JUST LIKE THAT.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.439
- YOU MUST NOT CARE
VERY MUCH.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.775
- [chuckles]

21:48.808 --> 21:53.413
I CARE MORE
THAN YOU WILL EVER KNOW.

21:53.446 --> 21:56.349
[phone ringing]

22:02.755 --> 22:05.958
HELLO?

22:05.992 --> 22:08.461
- HI.
I WAKE YOU?

22:10.029 --> 22:11.931
- MM, IT'S OKAY.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.600
[yawns]

22:13.633 --> 22:15.535
WHAT TIME IS IT THERE?

22:15.568 --> 22:18.871
- UH, I THINK
IT'S AROUND 10:30.

22:18.905 --> 22:21.974
- [yawning]
IT'S THREE HOURS LATER HERE.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.377
MMM.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

22:24.411 --> 22:26.779
- EVERYTHING'S FINE.

22:26.813 --> 22:30.750
HANK WAS REALLY GLAD
TO SEE ME.

22:30.783 --> 22:33.853
- I KNEW
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA YOU WENT.

22:33.886 --> 22:38.625
- HOW YOU DOING?
- MM.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.493
MISSING YOU.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.995
IT'S LONELY IN THIS BED.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.964
- IT'S LONELY HERE TOO.

22:44.997 --> 22:47.133
- I WAS DREAMING ABOUT YOU
WHEN YOU CALLED.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.936
- MMM, WHAT WAS I DOING?

22:49.969 --> 22:51.971
- I'M NOT TELLING.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.172
- LET ME GUESS.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.908
I HAD THE SAME DREAM.

22:55.942 --> 22:58.945
I WAS SUCKING YOUR COCK.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.012
- OH, YEAH?

23:00.046 --> 23:04.817
AND IT WAS...
REALLY...HARD.

23:06.453 --> 23:08.621
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

23:08.655 --> 23:10.890
- OH.
[groaning]

23:10.923 --> 23:13.025
I GUESS
I WAS REALLY HARD TOO.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.595
[chuckling]

23:15.628 --> 23:18.531
- THAT'S JUST LIKE
MY DREAM.

23:18.565 --> 23:21.601
YOU WERE RUBBING YOUR DICK
UP AGAINST ME,

23:21.634 --> 23:25.972
AND I WAS ASKING YOU
TO PUT IT INSIDE ME.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.541
- [moaning]

23:28.575 --> 23:31.578
YOU WANT ME TO PUT IT
INSIDE YOU?

23:31.611 --> 23:32.779
- YEAH.

23:32.812 --> 23:33.980
- [panting]

23:34.013 --> 23:35.915
HOW MUCH?

23:35.948 --> 23:38.685
- A LOT.

23:38.718 --> 23:39.919
GIVE IT TO ME.

23:39.952 --> 23:45.825
- [exhaling]
NOW?

23:45.858 --> 23:49.161
OKAY.

23:49.195 --> 23:50.797
- PLEASE.

23:50.830 --> 23:55.868
- I'M PUTTING IT
INSIDE YOU.

23:55.902 --> 23:59.038
- OH, GOD.
OH, YEAH.

23:59.071 --> 24:01.774
- I'M FUCKING YOU.

24:01.808 --> 24:04.243
I'M FUCKING YOU.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.645
[moaning]

24:05.678 --> 24:09.682
- * NOW

24:09.716 --> 24:12.885
* NOW

24:12.919 --> 24:14.721
* OH, NOW

24:14.754 --> 24:16.255
[moans of pleasure]

24:16.288 --> 24:20.560
* YES, NOW

24:20.593 --> 24:22.562
* OH, NOW

24:22.595 --> 24:25.832
- SO WHEN THE FUCK DID YOU
PLAN ON TELLING ME?

24:25.865 --> 24:27.567
- I WOULD SEND YOU
A CHANGE OF ADDRESS.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.168
- DON'T BE A SMART-ASS.

24:29.201 --> 24:32.705
- LOOK, THEY HAVEN'T EVEN
OFFERED ME THE JOB YET, OKAY?

24:32.739 --> 24:34.240
- YOU SAID THEY WERE
KNOCKED OUT BY YOUR RESUME

24:34.273 --> 24:35.842
AND THE INTERVIEW
WENT GREAT.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.545
- YEAH. YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
THEIR OFFICES,

24:38.578 --> 24:39.779
RIGHT ON MADISON AVENUE,

24:39.812 --> 24:43.049
WITH THIS KICK-ASS VIEW
OF MIDTOWN.

24:43.082 --> 24:46.986
AND THE GUYS AT THIS AGENCY,
THEY'RE FUCKING SMART.

24:47.019 --> 24:49.188
AND THEY'RE TOTALLY HOT.

24:49.221 --> 24:52.859
IT'S LIKE AN ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT LEAGUE.

24:52.892 --> 24:56.062
- SO YOU'RE JUST ABANDONING
YOUR SON.

24:56.095 --> 25:02.068
- DON'T START IN
WITH THE GUILT SHIT, OKAY?

25:02.101 --> 25:03.903
COME HERE, SONNY BOY.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.572
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HANG OUT

25:05.605 --> 25:08.240
WITH YOUR POP
IN MANHATTAN, HMM?

25:08.274 --> 25:09.976
GO TO THE GUGGENHEIM

25:10.009 --> 25:13.780
AND THE OPERA.

25:13.813 --> 25:15.147
SEE, YOU'RE GOING
TO THANK ME FOR THIS

25:15.181 --> 25:16.849
WHEN HE GROWS UP
TO BE SOPHISTICATED.

25:16.883 --> 25:17.750
- FUCK YOU, BRIAN.

25:17.784 --> 25:21.120
I KNOW HOW TO TAKE MY KID
TO A MUSEUM.

25:25.658 --> 25:27.994
- LINDSAY...

25:28.027 --> 25:30.029
IF I STAY HERE...

25:30.062 --> 25:32.665
I'M GOING TO GO
OUT OF MY MIND.

25:32.699 --> 25:33.900
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS
WHAT I'LL BECOME?

25:33.933 --> 25:36.068
- PROBABLY WHO YOU ARE NOW,
ONLY OLDER.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.069
- NO.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.905
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT?

25:38.938 --> 25:40.339
IT HAPPENS TO ALL OF US.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.042
- NOT ME.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.677
I WANT TO BECOME
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.613
SOMETHING NEW.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.347
- YOU SOUND LIKE
ONE OF YOUR AD CAMPAIGNS.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.983
"NEW, IMPROVED."

25:51.017 --> 25:52.852
GOING TO NEW YORK
WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.921
SO YOU'LL HAVE
A DIFFERENT LOFT,

25:54.954 --> 25:56.222
WORK FOR A DIFFERENT FIRM,

25:56.255 --> 25:57.924
GO TO DIFFERENT BARS
AND CLUBS.

25:57.957 --> 26:01.027
BUT DIFFERENT
DOESN'T MAKE IT BETTER.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.361
WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO FIGURE OUT

26:02.394 --> 26:05.932
THAT JUSTIN REALLY LOVES YOU,
EVEN IF HE IS YOUNG?

26:05.965 --> 26:08.835
AT YOUR AGE, THAT'S PROBABLY
NOT SUCH A BAD THING.

26:08.868 --> 26:14.040
AND MICHAEL WOULD GIVE UP
HIS LIFE FOR YOU.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.208
AND I LOVE YOU TOO.

26:16.242 --> 26:19.578
YOU THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT
ON MADISON AVENUE?

26:33.092 --> 26:36.262
- DON'T BE NERVOUS.
- I'M NOT.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.737
- [sighs]
I AM.

26:50.209 --> 26:51.844
[clears throat]

26:51.878 --> 26:53.379
- HEY, RIGHT ON TIME.

26:53.412 --> 26:56.015
- IT'S MY GERMANIC
PREDISPOSITION TO BE PUNCTUAL.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.217
- OOH, NICE SUIT.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.886
- TED PICKED IT OUT.

26:59.919 --> 27:02.188
AND THE SHIRT
AND THE TIE.

27:02.221 --> 27:05.124
- WELL, IT'S ALSO PART
OF MY GERMANIC PREDISPOSITION

27:05.157 --> 27:07.126
TO BE OVERBEARING
AND CONTROLLING,

27:07.159 --> 27:10.129
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE
A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.363
- I WILL.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.732
- OH, AND IF THEY ASK YOU

27:12.765 --> 27:13.900
WHY YOU LEFT
YOUR LAST JOB,

27:13.933 --> 27:15.334
JUST SAY IT WASN'T
CHALLENGING ENOUGH.

27:15.367 --> 27:16.869
- I'VE ALREADY GOT
AN ANSWER REHEARSED.

27:16.903 --> 27:18.137
- OH, AND FOR GOD'S SAKE,

27:18.170 --> 27:20.139
DON'T SAY
THAT YOU'RE A PEOPLE PERSON.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.173
I HATE THAT EXPRESSION.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.909
- I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT.
NOW, WOULD YOU GUYS

27:22.942 --> 27:26.112
STOP WORRYING AND JUST
LET ME GO IN THERE AND...

27:26.145 --> 27:28.180
IMPRESS THE PANTS
OFF THEM?

27:28.214 --> 27:29.315
- [sighs]

27:29.348 --> 27:32.785
WELL, IF ANYBODY CAN DO THAT,
YOU CAN.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.053
- [chuckles]

27:35.387 --> 27:39.358
- MELANIE SAYS IT'LL BE
MY WORD AGAINST HIS.

27:39.391 --> 27:41.093
SO WHY SHOULD THE JURY
LISTEN TO ME?

27:41.127 --> 27:43.462
- BECAUSE YOU'RE TELLING
THE TRUTH.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.265
CHRIST, VIC,
STOP ACTING SO GUILTY.

27:46.298 --> 27:49.301
- MAYBE I AM...

27:49.335 --> 27:51.303
A LITTLE.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.407
I WANTED TO GO WITH HIM.

27:55.441 --> 27:58.310
- SINCE WHEN IS THAT
A CRIME?

27:58.344 --> 28:00.279
- WHEN IT'S A COP.

28:00.312 --> 28:02.949
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH,

28:02.982 --> 28:06.919
AT MY AGE
AND WITH WHAT I'VE GOT...

28:06.953 --> 28:09.822
TO THINK SOMEONE
COULD FIND ME DESIRABLE--

28:09.856 --> 28:14.026
TALK ABOUT PATHETIC.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.495
- YOU ARE NOT PATHETIC!

28:16.528 --> 28:20.166
AND I WILL NOT HEAR YOU
TALK ABOUT YOURSELF THAT WAY.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.969
- THEN DON'T LISTEN.

28:23.002 --> 28:26.072
WHEN I LOOK IN THE MIRROR...

28:26.105 --> 28:30.810
I SEE SOMEONE
I BARELY RECOGNIZE.

28:30.843 --> 28:33.279
I STILL IMAGINE
I'M LIKE BRIAN,

28:33.312 --> 28:35.147
ABLE TO WALK IN ANY BAR

28:35.181 --> 28:37.950
AND HAVE ALMOST ANYBODY
THAT I WANT.

28:37.984 --> 28:40.953
AND I HAD PLENTY TOO.

28:40.987 --> 28:43.255
BUT NOW...

28:43.289 --> 28:47.259
INSTEAD I SEE THIS...
TIRED,

28:47.293 --> 28:52.298
SOMEWHAT FADED...
OLDER MAN...

28:52.331 --> 28:55.835
WHO MEASURES HIS LIFE
FROM A PILL BOTTLE...

28:55.868 --> 28:57.870
AND WHO NOBODY WANTS.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.511
DO YOU KNOW
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER

29:05.544 --> 29:09.916
THE LAST TIME
SOMEONE LOOKED AT ME?

29:09.949 --> 29:12.985
OR TOUCHED ME.

29:13.019 --> 29:14.553
IT WAS PROBABLY
THAT FILIPINO NURSE

29:14.586 --> 29:18.390
WHO GAVE ME
THAT BARIUM ENEMA.

29:18.424 --> 29:22.962
THAT WAS A TREAT.

29:22.995 --> 29:24.530
SO WHEN
THIS HANDSOME YOUNG MAN

29:24.563 --> 29:29.135
EXPRESSED INTEREST...

29:29.168 --> 29:34.941
I WANTED TO DROP TO MY KNEES
RIGHT THERE.

29:34.974 --> 29:38.544
THAT'S THE WORST PART.

29:38.577 --> 29:41.347
WORSE THAN BEING ARRESTED...

29:41.380 --> 29:44.884
OR BEING PUT IN JAIL...

29:44.917 --> 29:49.188
OR HAVING TO GO TO COURT.

29:49.221 --> 29:52.491
IT'S THAT...

29:52.524 --> 29:55.194
I BELIEVED HIM.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.076
[techno music]

30:10.109 --> 30:13.479
[laughter and chatter]

30:13.512 --> 30:15.314
*

30:15.347 --> 30:19.251
- THE THINGS MY TONGUE
COULD DO TO HIS NIPPLES.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.953
THAT IS,
IF I WAS SINGLE.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.222
- [laughs]
RIGHT THERE WITH YOU,

30:23.255 --> 30:24.924
ONLY I'D GO FOR HIS ABS.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.326
- I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU BOYS
FOR LEAVING ME

30:27.359 --> 30:30.596
THE MOST TENDER,
DELECTABLE MORSEL.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.398
AND NOW THAT BRIAN'S
FINALLY OUT OF THE PICTURE,

30:32.431 --> 30:34.500
I MIGHT ACTUALLY
STAND A CHANCE.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.202
- YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE
YOU'RE GONNA MISS HIM.

30:36.235 --> 30:37.603
- MM.

30:37.636 --> 30:40.072
I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING
TO MISS BEING TOLD "BE GONE"

30:40.106 --> 30:41.974
EVERY TIME
SOME HUNK APPEARS.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.443
- AND I WON'T MISS HIS LITTLE
BON MOT ABOUT MY AGE.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.145
- ALTHOUGH I DID THINK
HIS REFERRING TO YOU

30:46.178 --> 30:48.447
AS "DEAD MAN WALKING"
WAS KIND OF AMUSING.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.883
- [laughing]
- I SAID "KIND OF."

30:50.917 --> 30:53.152
- OR KNOWING THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS
GOING TO BE HIS PLAN "B."

30:53.185 --> 30:54.386
- OR SOMETIMES "C."

30:54.420 --> 30:56.222
- WELL, I WON'T MISS
SPENDING 300 BUCKS

30:56.255 --> 30:57.957
ON A SHIRT
FROM THE CALVIN KLEIN COLLECTION

30:57.990 --> 31:00.226
ONLY TO HAVE EVERYBODY STARE
AT BRIAN'S BARE CHEST.

31:00.259 --> 31:03.229
- OR FORCED TO WAIT
OUTSIDE A SEX CLUB IN FEBRUARY

31:03.262 --> 31:04.496
'CAUSE HE NEEDS
A RIDE HOME.

31:04.530 --> 31:08.300
- YEAH, I ALSO WON'T MISS HOW
HE NEVER TAKES SHIT FROM ANYONE.

31:08.334 --> 31:09.969
- OR HOW HE TELLS YOU
THE TRUTH ABOUT YOURSELF,

31:10.002 --> 31:13.339
EVEN IF IT IS
A TAD HARSH.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.241
BUT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
HEAR IT ANYWAY.

31:15.274 --> 31:18.978
- OR HOW HE REFUSES TO LET YOU
COAST THROUGH YOUR LIFE.

31:19.011 --> 31:21.680
NO, I'M NOT GOING TO MISS
THAT ONE AT ALL.

31:21.713 --> 31:26.552
*

31:40.499 --> 31:42.268
- THIS IS DISGUSTING!

31:42.301 --> 31:46.538
REALLY SICK.

31:46.572 --> 31:49.408
- WHAT, ARE YOU LOOKING AT
THOSE HETERO PORN SITES AGAIN?

31:49.441 --> 31:52.178
I TOLD YOU, THEY'RE GONNA WARP
YOUR YOUNG MIND.

31:52.211 --> 31:53.612
- IT'S NOT PORN.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.581
IT'S APARTMENT RENTALS
IN NEW YORK.

31:55.614 --> 31:58.017
CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY'RE
CHARGING FOR THIS SHIT HOLE.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.719
- HUH. YOU KNOW, WITH WHAT
THEY'RE GOING TO BE PAYING ME,

32:00.752 --> 32:03.689
I CAN AFFORD
THREE TIMES THAT?

32:03.722 --> 32:05.191
- YOU MEAN THIS IS CHEAP?

32:05.224 --> 32:06.592
- YEP.
[cell phone rings]

32:06.625 --> 32:08.694
- NEW YORK'S UNREAL.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.729
[beep]
- YEAH?

32:10.762 --> 32:13.099
- BRIAN, IT'S, UH, ADAM LYONS
CALLING FROM, UH,

32:13.132 --> 32:14.333
KENNEDY AND COLLINS
IN NEW YORK.

32:14.366 --> 32:16.035
- OH, HEY.

32:16.068 --> 32:18.704
SO I'VE BEEN WAITING TO HEAR
FROM YOU. WHAT'S THE DEAL?

32:18.737 --> 32:22.208
- UH, THE DEAL IS...

32:22.241 --> 32:24.043
THERE IS NO DEAL.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.377
THEY DECIDED TO PROMOTE
FROM WITHIN.

32:25.411 --> 32:28.447
SOME 25-YEAR-OLD HOTSHOT.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.317
LOOK...I'M REALLY SORRY.

32:31.350 --> 32:34.253
- UH...

32:34.286 --> 32:35.421
DON'T WORRY,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

32:35.454 --> 32:38.190
AFTER WEIGHING MY OPTIONS...

32:38.224 --> 32:41.160
I'VE DECIDED TO GO WITH...
SOMEONE ELSE.

32:41.193 --> 32:43.662
- WELL, THEN,
I DON'T FEEL SO BAD.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.098
SO, HEY, GIVE ME A CALL

32:46.132 --> 32:47.433
THE NEXT TIME
YOU'RE IN THE CITY.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.602
I'D LOVE TO HOOK UP AGAIN.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.672
- YEAH.
SURE.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.112
- [whistles]

33:00.146 --> 33:02.614
- YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU WERE COMING HOME TONIGHT.

33:02.648 --> 33:03.615
- LAST-MINUTE THING.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.185
WHOA!
[laughing]

33:06.218 --> 33:09.155
MMM.
- YOUR FACE IS COLD.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.256
SO HOW'D IT GO?

33:10.289 --> 33:11.457
- WELL, I CONVINCED HANK

33:11.490 --> 33:12.691
NOT TO QUIT
THE HOCKEY TEAM.

33:12.724 --> 33:14.093
- THAT'S A START.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.728
- AND HE'S AGREED TO TALK
TO A THERAPIST.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.630
- WELL, SEE?
I KNEW YOU COULD HELP HIM.

33:18.664 --> 33:20.799
- BUT MOSTLY,
WE JUST SAT AROUND,

33:20.832 --> 33:22.468
ATE PIZZA,
AND WATCHED ESPN.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.236
- SEE, THAT'S
THE IMPORTANT THING, YOU KNOW.

33:24.270 --> 33:27.073
NOT WHAT YOU SAY OR DO,
BUT JUST BEING THERE.

33:27.106 --> 33:28.607
- THAT'S WHY
I GOTTA GO BACK.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.775
- WELL, YOU SHOULD.
WE--

33:29.808 --> 33:31.377
MAYBE THIS SUMMER,
WE COULD TAKE A TRIP.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.745
- NO, I WAS THINKING SOONER.

33:33.779 --> 33:36.082
- HOW MUCH SOONER?

33:36.115 --> 33:39.551
- RIGHT AWAY.

33:39.585 --> 33:40.686
- WELL, FOR HOW LONG?

33:40.719 --> 33:42.154
- WELL, I'M NOT SURE.

33:42.188 --> 33:43.389
ALL I KNOW
IS THAT HE NEEDS ME,

33:43.422 --> 33:47.559
AND IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT I'M THERE.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.329
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT
YOUR PRACTICE AND YOUR FRIENDS

33:50.362 --> 33:51.763
AND THE HOUSE AND...

33:51.797 --> 33:55.167
- I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT
ON THE FLIGHT HOME.

33:55.201 --> 33:56.668
I COULD LEASE
THE HOUSE FOR A YEAR.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.804
ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES
COULD TAKE OVER MY PRACTICE.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.706
LORI'S GOT SOME FRIENDS
WHO ARE DOCTORS.

34:00.739 --> 34:05.677
THEY COULD PROVIDE ME
WITH REFERRALS.

34:05.711 --> 34:09.081
- SO YOU'VE PRACTICALLY GOT THIS
ALL FIGURED OUT.

34:09.115 --> 34:12.718
- WELL, THERE IS ONE THING THAT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH.

34:14.720 --> 34:17.423
- OH, UM, WELL,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

34:17.456 --> 34:19.091
I-I UNDERSTAND.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.160
HANK COMES FIRST.

34:21.193 --> 34:23.362
- OH, IT'S NOT A RACE,
MICHAEL.

34:23.395 --> 34:26.432
THERE'S NO "FIRST."

34:26.465 --> 34:30.736
YOU'RE AS IMPORTANT TO ME
AS HE IS.

34:30.769 --> 34:34.806
WHAT I WAS HOPING...

34:34.840 --> 34:38.210
IS THAT YOU WOULD COME
WITH ME.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.715
- THIS COP
HAS LIED BEFORE

34:43.749 --> 34:45.317
IN AT LEAST
FOUR SEPARATE CASES.

34:45.351 --> 34:46.452
- YOU HAVE PROOF
OF THIS?

34:46.485 --> 34:47.353
- I LOOKED UP
HIS RECORDS

34:47.386 --> 34:49.321
WHEN HE WAS
WITH THE PHILADELPHIA P.D.

34:49.355 --> 34:51.590
IN EACH INSTANCE,
HE EXAGGERATED, MISCONSTRUED,

34:51.623 --> 34:53.825
OR COMPLETELY LIED
IN HIS ARREST REPORTS,

34:53.859 --> 34:55.827
RESULTING IN THE JUDGE
DECLARING A MISTRIAL.

34:55.861 --> 35:02.368
[indistinct chatter]

35:02.401 --> 35:04.336
- SHE'S GOOD.
- SHE'S GREAT.

35:04.370 --> 35:08.407
- COMPARED TO HER,
I FEEL SO IGNORANT, SO USELESS.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.277
- YOU ARE.

35:11.310 --> 35:14.446
ON THE OTHER HAND, UH,
SHE DOESN'T HAVE YOUR HEIGHT

35:14.480 --> 35:17.216
OR YOUR ABILITY TO WEAR
CHARTREUSE IN THE DAYTIME,

35:17.249 --> 35:18.517
SO IT ALL EVENS OUT.

35:18.550 --> 35:19.718
- SHH!

35:19.751 --> 35:21.187
- THIS IS VERY COMPELLING,

35:21.220 --> 35:22.488
BUT WHY WOULD HE DO THIS?

35:22.521 --> 35:25.291
- SEEMS HE HAS A LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH GAY PEOPLE.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.559
LOOK, WE CAN SAVE THE COURT
A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.228
MY CLIENT'S INNOCENT.

35:29.261 --> 35:30.462
HE WAS ENTRAPPED
BY THIS OFFICER,

35:30.496 --> 35:31.530
JUST LIKE THESE OTHER MEN.

35:31.563 --> 35:34.233
- IS THIS TRUE?

35:34.266 --> 35:38.237
- I MAY HAVE DONE A LOT
OF THINGS IN MY LIFE, SIR...

35:38.270 --> 35:41.607
BUT I NEVER EXPOSED MYSELF
OR ENTICED THAT OFFICER.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.842
AND EVEN THOUGH I MAY NOT
HAVE MUCH LEFT--

35:43.875 --> 35:47.446
MY HEALTH, MY YOUTH,
MY FRIENDS--

35:47.479 --> 35:50.282
I STILL HAVE MY NAME.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.659
AND I WILL FIGHT...

36:00.692 --> 36:03.929
TO DEFEND IT.

36:03.962 --> 36:06.832
- YOU'RE A VERY SPECIAL LADY,
YOU KNOW THAT?

36:06.865 --> 36:10.602
- I MISS YOU ALREADY.

36:10.636 --> 36:12.404
- YOU JUST LISTEN
TO THE DRUM.

36:12.438 --> 36:13.505
IT'S THE SOUND
OF MY HEART CALLING...

36:13.539 --> 36:15.674
- YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED?

36:15.707 --> 36:19.278
A SUPER HUMONGOUS,
WOOLLY-MAMMOTH-SIZE VAT

36:19.311 --> 36:20.646
OF BUTTERED POPCORN.

36:20.679 --> 36:21.780
[giggling]

36:21.813 --> 36:24.416
- ONE HIT,
AND YOU'RE HIGH.

36:24.450 --> 36:25.417
- [suppressed giggling]

36:25.451 --> 36:26.585
- THAT'S PITIFUL.

36:26.618 --> 36:30.756
- I AM NOT HIGH.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.358
[snickering]

36:32.391 --> 36:35.461
OKAY, MAYBE I AM.

36:35.494 --> 36:39.298
[man on screen shouting]

36:39.331 --> 36:41.767
- THAT, UM,
MEAN, OLD USHER,

36:41.800 --> 36:44.303
WHO USED TO TELL US TO GET
OUR FEET OFF THE SEATS,

36:44.336 --> 36:46.405
STILL WORKING HERE OR...

36:46.438 --> 36:47.639
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

36:47.673 --> 36:50.742
PROBABLY A FUCKING MAGGOT FEAST
BY NOW.

36:50.776 --> 36:53.945
- MAN, WHEN I THINK
OF ALL THE SATURDAY AFTERNOONS

36:53.979 --> 36:55.447
WE SPENT HERE...

36:55.481 --> 36:56.748
- YEAH, I USED
TO BUY A TICKET

36:56.782 --> 36:58.750
AND LET YOU
IN THAT FIRE EXIT.

36:58.784 --> 37:01.720
- NEVER GOT CAUGHT.

[orchestral music on screen]

37:04.756 --> 37:09.561
*

37:09.595 --> 37:10.629
- THIS IS WHERE WE SAW

37:10.662 --> 37:13.265
INDIANA JONES
AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM.

37:13.299 --> 37:15.501
- AND, UH,
AND GHOSTBUSTERS.

37:15.534 --> 37:16.502
[chuckles]
AND, UH...

37:16.535 --> 37:19.971
- THE FLY.
- THE FLY. YEAH.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.408
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE GONNA TEAR IT DOWN.

37:22.441 --> 37:26.345
ALL THOSE CHEESY CINEPLEXES.

37:26.378 --> 37:28.480
- YEAH, THEY DON'T HAVE
ANY BALCONIES TO GET STONED IN.

37:28.514 --> 37:30.482
[sniffles]

37:35.053 --> 37:36.455
- WHEN THIS PLACE IS GONE,

37:36.488 --> 37:39.658
A PART OF US'LL
BE GONE TOO.

37:41.793 --> 37:44.963

WHEN YOU'RE HIGH.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.898
- TIMMY?

37:46.932 --> 37:49.768
- WELL,
THIS'LL PROBABLY BE...

37:49.801 --> 37:53.439
THE LAST TIME YOU AND I
ARE EVER HERE TOGETHER.

37:53.472 --> 37:56.842
I MEAN,
YOU'LL BE IN NEW YORK.

37:59.478 --> 38:03.682
- AND YOU'LL BE
IN PORTLAND.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.851
OPPOSITE FUCKING ENDS
OF THE UNIVERSE.

38:05.884 --> 38:08.320

38:08.354 --> 38:10.522
- WELL, YOU SHOULD.

38:10.556 --> 38:11.657
- I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.492
I CAN'T JUST WAKE UP
ONE MORNING

38:13.525 --> 38:16.795
AND DECIDE, BOOM,
YOU KNOW, IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.

38:16.828 --> 38:21.367
NO LOOKING BACK,
NO REGRETS.

38:21.400 --> 38:26.338

FOR YOU HERE.

IT'S NOT PARIS OR NEW YORK...

MY ENTIRE LIFE, AND...

38:38.584 --> 38:39.685
IT'S ALL I KNOW.

SOMETHING ELSE, MICHAEL.
