WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Well, can you no' just do without
it for one night?

00:04.000 --> 00:05.160
He needs his phone, Eric.

00:05.160 --> 00:07.600
It'll only take me five minutes to
nip back and get my charger.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.720
Oh, for God's sake.
What time is the table booked for?

00:09.720 --> 00:11.240
Not till half past. Oh.

00:12.280 --> 00:18.040
This programme contains
strong language.

00:18.040 --> 00:20.640
You'd be as well to just come in,
actually - I've just realised

00:20.640 --> 00:23.560
I don't have my wee adapter thing
for the car with me.

00:23.560 --> 00:27.280
I'll need to plug it in inside
for five minutes. Oh, bloody hell!

00:28.720 --> 00:32.560
Did we not leave the lamp on? Eric,
did you not leave the hall lamp on?

00:32.560 --> 00:34.920
I don't know. Normally,
we leave the lamp on...

00:34.920 --> 00:37.120
ALL: Surprise!

00:38.240 --> 00:40.080
SQUEALING

00:40.080 --> 00:43.480
Happy anniversary, Mum.
Happy anniversary, Beth.

00:43.480 --> 00:46.640
Dear God, I nearly jumped out of
my bloody skin there.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.360
Congratulations, squire.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.680
Happy anniversary, Mr Baird.

00:50.680 --> 00:55.280
I don't know what to say. This is
lovely. At last!

00:55.280 --> 00:57.160
Beth, where's your kitchen roll?

00:57.160 --> 01:00.520
MUSIC PLAYS

01:13.720 --> 01:16.280
You're a wee swine.
I thought you'd twig in the car.

01:16.280 --> 01:19.120
I was like, ah, he knows,
he knows something is going on.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.360
See your face when you walked in.
I know, what was it like?

01:21.360 --> 01:23.880
I didn't know what was
happening for a minute.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.200
Aye, see cos you're older
and quite heavy,

01:26.200 --> 01:28.320
I thought you might take an
actual stroke.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.760
You really didn't need to go to all
this trouble, Gordon.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.080
Ian said you'd say that.

01:34.080 --> 01:35.720
Just look at all this.

01:35.720 --> 01:39.120
That reminds me,
I got you a little present as well.

01:39.120 --> 01:42.840
Oh, you didn't need to bother.
30 years being married to Mr Baird!

01:42.840 --> 01:44.400
We had to give you something.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.080
Aye, a cyanide capsule.

01:48.280 --> 01:52.120
All right, Michelle? I didn't
realise it was a dressy-up affair!

01:52.120 --> 01:55.360
I just thought, seeing it was a
special occasion.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.520
Oh, give us a twirl.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.200
Go on.

02:00.560 --> 02:02.320
Have you got any pants on?

02:03.960 --> 02:06.520
Top up, Mr Baird? Go on.

02:06.520 --> 02:09.960
Hasn't he done well,
arranging all this?

02:09.960 --> 02:11.920
Aye, tremendous.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.560
It's no trouble. I wanted to.

02:13.560 --> 02:17.120
He got us all in here while Ian was
lying to you in his car.

02:17.120 --> 02:20.480
Listen, I appreciate you going to
all this bother, I really do.

02:20.480 --> 02:23.120
So do I, Eric. I'll just give you a
little kiss

02:23.120 --> 02:24.640
to say well done, Gordon.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.240
That's nice.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.440
OK, everyone, listen up.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.320
Shh, shh, shush, shush!

02:35.320 --> 02:39.360
I'd just like to say a massive
thank you for coming to

02:39.360 --> 02:42.840
celebrate my mum and dad's 30th
wedding anniversary.

02:42.840 --> 02:45.280
CHEERING

02:45.280 --> 02:47.280
Now, he didn't want to make a big
fuss or have a big do

02:47.280 --> 02:49.800
or anything, but we just felt we
ought to do something at least to

02:49.800 --> 02:53.360
mark the occasion.
Aye, let's get really pissed!

02:54.600 --> 02:57.480
So, if you join me in wishing
congratulations to my mum for

02:57.480 --> 03:00.040
putting up with my dad
for all these years.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.440
Oh, ha-ha(!)

03:01.440 --> 03:04.320
And congratulations to dad for
punching so far above his weight.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.800
LAUGHTER

03:05.800 --> 03:06.960
To Mum and Dad!

03:06.960 --> 03:08.280
Woohoo, Eric and Beth!

03:08.280 --> 03:11.200
Beth and Eric! Mr and Mrs Baird!

03:11.200 --> 03:14.320
Oh, I should just say...
For fuck's sake.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.920
Erm, I should just say as well,
thank you to Gordon.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.720
He has worked his socks off.

03:19.720 --> 03:22.280
I couldn't have arranged any of it
if it wasn't for him.

03:22.280 --> 03:25.960
Well done, Gordon. Another one from
me, honey. Just another one.

03:29.680 --> 03:34.000
Right, Ian. Let's get this trifle
dished oot and into the bowls.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.360
In a bit, Christine, we haven't had
any of the sandwiches or anything
yet.

03:37.360 --> 03:42.880
Wait till you taste this, Michelle.
Did you make it, did you? I did.

03:42.880 --> 03:46.120
Well, I didn't know what to get them
for a present and I thought

03:46.120 --> 03:49.120
about a voucher or maybe a wee
bit of porcelain.

03:49.120 --> 03:52.320
But then I went into my cupboard and
saw the four tins of fruit cocktail

03:52.320 --> 03:55.920
and I thought,
"Fuck it, trifle it is."

03:57.520 --> 04:01.520
So, this time 30 years ago, eh? Aye.
So how did the two of you meet?

04:01.520 --> 04:02.880
It was at a party actually.

04:02.880 --> 04:06.080
Aye. At my pal Davie's house.
Davie who?

04:06.080 --> 04:10.200
Love at first sight was it, Eric?
It was for me. Aw.

04:10.200 --> 04:13.480
We were actually set up. Who by?

04:13.480 --> 04:15.400
Jeremy Beadle?

04:18.200 --> 04:20.280
How did you two meet?

04:20.280 --> 04:24.200
How did you end up with Alan,
Michelle, you must get asked that a
lot?

04:24.200 --> 04:27.680
We've actually been going out
together since we were at school.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.040
Have you? That's great.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.480
You been together since you were
at school?!

04:31.480 --> 04:35.000
Yes. Ian and me are coming up for
eight months in three weeks' time.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.520
What, you've never been anywhere
else except him? No.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.160
Aw, that's nice.

04:41.160 --> 04:44.200
I did pump one other lassie before
we started going out but it's

04:44.200 --> 04:45.520
just been her since then.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.920
Anyway, listen, there's tonnes of
food so feel free

04:47.920 --> 04:49.280
to dig in and help yourself.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.120
Yes, let's get tore into
this trifle.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.240
It's home-made, none of your
shop-bought pish. Yes, Christine.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.880
We'll get round to it.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.200
Aye, all right,
son, but don't take too long,

04:59.200 --> 05:02.520
cos technically that cream
needs to be used before midnight.

05:10.440 --> 05:14.840
Isn't this lovely?
Aye, it's a good spread, Beth.

05:14.840 --> 05:19.120
There was tempura prawns as well,
but unfortunately they were

05:19.120 --> 05:20.640
finished before you got here.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.640
Oh. Alan!

05:22.640 --> 05:24.600
Whit?

05:24.600 --> 05:27.960
Did you try the wee baby quiches?
There's none left.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.960
Aye, they were very popular too.

05:38.760 --> 05:42.880
You managing? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
It's going all right, isn't it?

05:42.880 --> 05:45.400
Is your mum enjoying it? Yeah!

05:45.400 --> 05:48.960
She's put a picture of the buffet up
on Facebook already. That's nice.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.360
Aye. Everybody all right for a
drink?

05:51.360 --> 05:53.720
Eh, Cathy wants one. All
right, where's the glass.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.440
No, don't bother with that,
just give us the bottle.

05:56.440 --> 06:00.320
Colin and me celebrate our wedding
anniversary every single year,

06:00.320 --> 06:04.720
don't we, Colin?
We do, yeah. It's important to us.

06:04.720 --> 06:07.960
How long have you been married for,
Cathy? Eight years.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.720
Nine. Nine.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.360
I've had my van nine year.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.320
So, when can we be expecting the
sound of wedding bells for

06:15.320 --> 06:18.680
you two then? I think that's a
while off yet, Colin.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.760
Keeping your options open,
are you, Michelle?

06:21.760 --> 06:24.360
No, no, we just want to wait until
the time is right.

06:24.360 --> 06:27.560
Aye, once we've had the floors
done and she's had the all clear in
the IBS.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.440
You want to see what she has to send
away in thae wee tubs, by the way.

06:32.160 --> 06:36.120
You're engaged though, yeah? Well,
not officially, no. Are you not,
Michelle?

06:36.120 --> 06:40.120
No. Not yet. Here, Alan, see when I
proposed to Cathy, what was it like?

06:40.120 --> 06:43.680
Remember that, Cathy?
It was unbelievable, Michelle.

06:43.680 --> 06:44.880
It was night-time.

06:44.880 --> 06:48.640
We were on the balcony of this
beautiful five-star hotel,

06:48.640 --> 06:51.520
overlooking the sea with the lights
and the stars. It was...

06:51.520 --> 06:54.720
It was amazing.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.040
Where was that? Venice.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.600
It was Crete. Crete.

06:58.600 --> 07:02.240
Have you had enough to eat? Plenty,
there's so much lovely stuff.

07:02.240 --> 07:06.200
There's trifle, Beth. Right.
Ian, come on.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.960
Let's get that trifle fired
into thae bowls.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.000
Awright, OK.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.760
Hang on. Aren't we going to do the
thing now? Oh, shit, right!

07:13.760 --> 07:18.200
Christine, we'll do the trifle in a
minute. Oh, for God's sake.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.320
Everybody, everybody, listen up.
Listen up, everyone.

07:21.320 --> 07:25.560
We've got a wee surprise that
we've organised. ALL: Woo!

07:25.560 --> 07:27.400
Is it a gay stripper?

07:27.400 --> 07:30.800
We've organised a Mr and Mrs quiz.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.520
Oh, yay! What is that?

07:32.520 --> 07:35.920
We have got a quiz for you and
Mum about your married life.

07:35.920 --> 07:39.080
Oh, question one,
how has she stuck it for so long?

07:39.080 --> 07:40.840
This'll be interesting, Eric,

07:40.840 --> 07:43.920
see how well you been paying
attention over the years, eh?

07:43.920 --> 07:45.040
I'd be shite at it.

07:45.040 --> 07:48.880
I couldn't even tell you the size of
her feet. They look like a four.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.320
You should've told me we were
going to do this.

07:51.320 --> 07:53.800
It wouldn't have been a surprise
then, would it?

07:53.800 --> 07:56.120
Come on, you lot, take a seat.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.360
Oh! # Mr and Mrs... #
Remember that one, Christine?

07:59.360 --> 08:03.160
Oh, aye. # Be nice to each other

08:03.160 --> 08:05.840
# Mr and Mrs... #

08:05.840 --> 08:06.880
What was it?

08:06.880 --> 08:09.800
# Friends and lovers... #

08:09.800 --> 08:11.040
That's it.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.760
# Dee dee dee

08:13.760 --> 08:17.120
# Dee dee, dee, dee, da-ra dee. #

08:17.120 --> 08:18.920
I never watched it.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.200
OK, everybody, ready? No.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.000
Come on! Yeah. Yay!

08:24.000 --> 08:26.200
CHEERING
Quiet, everyone.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.120
Quiet everyone. Shut up, Michelle.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.200
So, we've got some questions.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.320
We're going to test your knowledge
about how well you two know

08:34.320 --> 08:35.560
each other because you are...

08:35.560 --> 08:38.680
ALL: Mr and Mrs!

08:39.840 --> 08:42.480
OK, so you take that, Mrs Baird.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.800
And when we ask you the question,

08:44.800 --> 08:48.440
you have to write down your answer
in secret and then when

08:48.440 --> 08:52.000
Mr Baird gives us his answer, we see
if what you've written down matches.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.280
Right. Alan, are you bored?
I am bored.

08:57.440 --> 09:03.080
So, first question. What is
Mr Baird's favourite food?

09:03.080 --> 09:06.160
Christ,
she's gonna need a bigger pad.

09:06.160 --> 09:09.040
I'd say... Uh! Write it down.

09:09.040 --> 09:12.120
Write it down, Beth, stupid!

09:12.120 --> 09:13.960
OK, ready?

09:13.960 --> 09:18.480
OK, so we asked you Mr Baird's
favourite food was and it is...

09:18.480 --> 09:20.280
Steak.

09:20.280 --> 09:22.920
Yes, Eric, big beefy steak.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.640
And you said...

09:25.640 --> 09:27.840
CHEERING

09:29.000 --> 09:32.800
One point to you, Mrs Baird.
OK, Mr Baird. This one's for you.

09:32.800 --> 09:37.320
Here you are, Eric, take that.
Pass the... Pass the pad.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.920
You've got to pass the pad.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.880
What is the first thing Mrs Baird
does in the morning?

09:41.880 --> 09:44.440
She goes for a poo! Write poo, Eric.

09:44.440 --> 09:47.000
Or you could just draw one.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.240
I can draw them, I can.
Aw different wans.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.320
Wee pointy wans. Big logs...

09:52.320 --> 09:54.160
Let him think.

09:56.920 --> 10:00.280
Are you ready? Nearly, hang on.
Hang on. Yeah.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.760
OK, Mrs Baird,

10:01.760 --> 10:05.120
the first thing that you do in the
morning when you wake up is...

10:05.120 --> 10:06.280
Have a cup of tea.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.400
CHEERING

10:10.400 --> 10:13.880
That's close enough,
give him that. Yeah!

10:13.880 --> 10:16.160
OK, next question. To Mrs Baird.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.800
There you go, Beth.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.920
# Pass the pad!
Go on, pass the pad... #

10:19.920 --> 10:24.760
What is Mr Baird most afraid of,
what is his biggest fear?

10:24.760 --> 10:27.560
ALL: Ooooh!

10:27.560 --> 10:29.560
Gosh, let me think. Erm...

10:29.560 --> 10:30.720
Snakes.

10:30.720 --> 10:34.400
Aye, could be. Or mibbe, mibbe,

10:34.400 --> 10:38.560
something happening to Ian. Yes!
Like Ian dying.

10:38.560 --> 10:42.480
Oh, that's good, Ian dying.
Because of a snake.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.680
Aye, a mamba.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.960
They chase you. Or he could drown.

10:46.960 --> 10:50.960
He could get bitten by a snake and
then drown. Aye, aye...

10:50.960 --> 10:53.640
That's good. OK, ready, Mrs Baird?

10:53.640 --> 10:56.600
Mr Baird,
what are you most scared of?

10:56.600 --> 10:59.880
Well, I was going to say seeing
Christine in her nightie.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.280
But no, it's snakes.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.320
Yes!

11:04.320 --> 11:06.520
Snakes. Oh, yay!

11:06.520 --> 11:08.600
Ssssssss.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.320
That's my mum got two and my dad's
got one.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.720
OK, Eric. OK.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.560
If she wasn't married to you,

11:16.560 --> 11:20.760
what famous person would Mrs Baird
like to be married to?

11:22.080 --> 11:23.840
I'd be Dermot O'Leary.

11:23.840 --> 11:28.160
Dermot O'Leary, Michelle, I'd
fucking shag his brains out.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.520
Eric... Eric.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.440
Paul Hollywood.

11:34.440 --> 11:38.800
The blue eyes and the wee bits of
flour on his hands, eh?

11:39.840 --> 11:42.040
Let's see what you put, Dad.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.560
There you are. George Clooney.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.760
Well, yes, he'd do if I had to
choose but I'm very happy

11:47.760 --> 11:49.800
with what I've got, thank you.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.600
Aw! So sweet.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.400
OK, well, another point to Mr Baird.
Here you go, Beth.

11:54.400 --> 12:00.200
Next question. Hang on, hang on, how
many more have you got? A few.

12:00.200 --> 12:04.240
Maybe another 20. Jesus!

12:04.240 --> 12:06.920
Maybe just one more then?

12:06.920 --> 12:10.480
Yeah, one more and that'll do us.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.160
OK, then.

12:13.160 --> 12:16.800
Erm, not that one.
Erm, not that one...

12:18.280 --> 12:20.320
Favourite yoghurt? No.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.800
I've got one.

12:21.800 --> 12:26.080
Can I do one? Aye, go on, Michelle.
Let Michelle ask one.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.120
Yeah, go on, Michelle.

12:28.120 --> 12:32.520
OK. What is
the best thing about being married?

12:35.120 --> 12:36.680
Phew...

12:36.680 --> 12:38.280
Keep it clean, Beth.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.800
Don't write sex, Beth, don't make us
think about that. Ready?

12:41.800 --> 12:43.280
Nearly.

12:43.280 --> 12:47.920
Right, Dad, what did Mum say was
the best thing about being married?

12:47.920 --> 12:49.760
Erm...

12:49.760 --> 12:52.800
It's hard to say. I mean...
Does she do your washing, Eric?

12:52.800 --> 12:55.920
It's good to get your washing
done. Aye, eh...

12:55.920 --> 13:01.760
I think the best thing about being
married is probably, well,

13:01.760 --> 13:05.160
it's just seeing each other every
day.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.520
Spending time together.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.480
Aw! Aw!

13:12.480 --> 13:14.760
Come here, you.

13:18.040 --> 13:19.720
All right?

13:21.320 --> 13:23.360
Would you like to get married,
Gordon?

13:23.360 --> 13:25.400
Aye, they can now.
They're allowed, aren't they?

13:25.400 --> 13:28.400
Oh, my God, a gay wedding,
I'd love that!

13:28.400 --> 13:31.040
Get married, Gordon!

13:31.040 --> 13:33.840
What actually happens
at a gay wedding?

13:33.840 --> 13:35.280
Well, it's just the same.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.360
The same? How is it the same?

13:37.360 --> 13:40.840
Well, it just is. It's just
two people doing their vows.

13:40.840 --> 13:42.880
Aye, but vowing what, though?

13:42.880 --> 13:44.640
That it's no' just a phase?

13:44.640 --> 13:46.840
Well, I think it's great
they can dae that now.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.720
I mean, they've had years of people
shouting at them,

13:49.720 --> 13:51.960
and creeping about in toilets.

13:51.960 --> 13:55.120
I mean, you cannae begrudge them
a wee party.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.120
I couldnae have it off in a bog!

13:57.120 --> 13:59.760
Men's toilets fucking stink.

13:59.760 --> 14:03.440
Gordon, if Ian asked you
to marry him, what would you say?

14:03.440 --> 14:05.000
Cathy!
Just interested.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.880
Cathy, I don't think...
Would you say yes?

14:06.880 --> 14:08.240
Just ignore her, Gordon.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.880
I bet you would!

14:09.880 --> 14:11.320
I bet he would, Ian.

14:12.280 --> 14:15.160
I bet you wish you'd asked Jaz now,
don't you?

14:15.160 --> 14:17.120
Just ask Gordon instead.
For God's sake!

14:17.120 --> 14:19.200
Oh, Jaz, he was the one I liked.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.440
Aye, I liked Jaz.

14:20.440 --> 14:23.320
Who's Jaz?
He was the one before Gordon.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.320
Jaz is short for...

14:25.320 --> 14:26.520
Er...

14:26.520 --> 14:27.760
Well, he was Asian.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.800
Come on!
Do you ever hear from him, Ian?

14:29.800 --> 14:31.680
No! Gordon, just ignore it.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.720
Would you, Gordon, if Ian said to
you, "Gordon, would you marry me?",

14:34.720 --> 14:35.920
what would you say?

14:35.920 --> 14:38.040
Cathy, you can't put somebody
on the spot like that.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.960
Shut up, Michelle,
it's got nothing to do with you!

14:40.960 --> 14:43.000
It's got nothing to do with you,
either.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.160
Excuse me, Eric, Gordon and I
are actually very close.

14:46.160 --> 14:48.520
All his stuff about bulimia
at university.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.920
WHISPERS: I'm the only one
that knows about that.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.600
Come on!

14:53.600 --> 14:56.080
If Ian said, "Gordon, will you
marry me?", what would you say?

14:58.680 --> 14:59.760
Well...

15:00.840 --> 15:01.960
Well...

15:01.960 --> 15:03.040
I suppose...

15:05.680 --> 15:07.120
I suppose I'd say yes.

15:07.120 --> 15:11.520
Would you? Ian, he's up for it!

15:11.520 --> 15:13.800
Ian, would you like to marry Gordon?

15:13.800 --> 15:15.880
Cathy, I'm not doing this.
Ian!

15:15.880 --> 15:18.000
Cathy, no!
You wouldn't?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.200
No, I'm not saying that...
So you're saying you would?

15:20.200 --> 15:21.480
No!
What ARE you saying?

15:21.480 --> 15:23.400
Would you or would you not
like to marry Gordon?

15:23.400 --> 15:24.560
I don't know!

15:34.520 --> 15:36.760
You got any other games, Gordon?

15:49.600 --> 15:52.040
Was it actually 30 years ago today,
was it?

15:52.040 --> 15:53.360
Tomorrow.

15:53.360 --> 15:56.320
So this time 30 years ago,
you'd have been where?

15:56.320 --> 15:59.600
At my mum and dad's with my sister,
getting ready.

15:59.600 --> 16:03.200
And what about you, Eric? Where were
you, eh? Oot on the randan?

16:03.200 --> 16:05.800
Oh, my best man and I
just went for a curry.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.160
Oh, that'd be nice for your
wedding night,

16:08.160 --> 16:10.520
him lying next to you
with the big curry farts.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.040
That must have been lovely, Beth,
with your family.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.960
Were you trying on the dress
and all that?

16:16.960 --> 16:20.800
Yes, yes, and my mum had actually
made the veil herself.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.000
I'd love to see pictures
of your dress.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.720
Go and get your wedding album, Beth.

16:34.760 --> 16:38.120
Are you OK, Alan, honey?
Are you needing another drink?

16:38.120 --> 16:41.280
Er, aye, on you go.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.560
Gordon, are you all right to get
Alan a drink?

16:43.560 --> 16:44.800
Or are you feeling a bit...?

16:44.800 --> 16:46.280
No! I'm fine.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.400
Right, drinks! Who wants what?

16:48.400 --> 16:50.400
I'll give you a hand.
No!

16:50.400 --> 16:52.080
Right, beer for Alan,

16:52.080 --> 16:54.960
and I'll bring another bottle
of bubbly through, too.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.680
Let's all get really drunk!

16:59.280 --> 17:01.400
WHISPERS: Michelle.

17:10.720 --> 17:13.560
Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:13.560 --> 17:16.520
Look, I didn't mean when Cathy
asked me about getting married

17:16.520 --> 17:18.880
that I wasn't sure because
I wasn't sure about YOU.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.880
Don't worry about it.
She just sprung it on me.

17:20.880 --> 17:25.240
It's fine, honestly, it's OK.
Let's just get on with the drinking.

17:28.440 --> 17:31.680
So that's the church.
Oh, yeah!

17:31.680 --> 17:34.880
Was it the one beside the exhaust
place you got married in, Beth?

17:34.880 --> 17:36.400
Yes, it was, Colin.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.320
You can swap places with me,
Christine.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.920
I'm not interested.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.600
Right, Beth.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.440
Budge up. That's it.

17:44.440 --> 17:45.920
Right, let's get a look, Beth.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.680
That's us outside.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.880
Get her to show you the one where
her dress gets caught

17:49.880 --> 17:52.400
in the car door,
that's a good one.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.880
That's us going in.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.800
Oh, my God, you look lovely!

17:56.840 --> 17:59.800
Your hair's quite flat there, Beth.

17:59.800 --> 18:04.240
Did you not want to give it a bit
of height for your special day?

18:04.240 --> 18:06.600
The dress is amazing.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.280
She looked lovely.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.480
See when she walked in and I saw
her? Oh...

18:12.640 --> 18:14.680
That's us cutting the cake.

18:14.680 --> 18:16.800
Oh, is that you
having your first dance?

18:16.800 --> 18:18.280
It is, yeah.

18:18.280 --> 18:20.040
What was your first dance to?

18:20.040 --> 18:22.360
Amore.
That's right, Amore.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.640
Oh, I love that.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.200
# When the moon... #

18:27.200 --> 18:28.840
Yeah, we know how it goes.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.520
I'll tell you what was
really amazing, though.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.600
It was the dance that me and Colin
did at our wedding.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.200
Oh, what was it like, Col?

18:37.200 --> 18:39.640
Aye, it was a bit special, aye.

18:39.640 --> 18:43.560
That was amazing, Michelle.
Oh, right.

18:43.560 --> 18:47.440
We got married in the
Dominican Republic, Alan.

18:47.440 --> 18:51.160
Did yous, aye?
Yep. Punta de...

18:51.160 --> 18:52.600
Er...

18:52.600 --> 18:54.600
It was Thomson's platinum, Alan.

18:54.600 --> 18:58.240
We had the ceremony on the beach.
Wow.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.520
But we had to move into the
pool area for the reception,

19:00.520 --> 19:02.640
because the drug dealers
use the beach at night.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.560
So who were your bridesmaids?

19:04.560 --> 19:06.880
Did they let your friends fly over
for it, then, did they?

19:06.880 --> 19:09.960
Well, a few, not as many as we'd
liked. See, it was

19:09.960 --> 19:13.040
quite near Christmas, and folk were
watching their pennies, you know.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.440
When was it?
First week in May.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.560
But it was fine, because there was a
lot of folk there

19:17.560 --> 19:19.080
wanting to wish us well.

19:19.080 --> 19:22.560
There was a big crowd from
Doncaster, wasn't there?

19:22.560 --> 19:26.760
Couple from Belgium.
Heavy, heavy smokers.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.120
Spoke a bit of English.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.800
And the wee guy
that hosed the plants,

19:29.800 --> 19:31.240
he stuck his head in with a card.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.360
But see when we got up
to do the dance?

19:33.360 --> 19:34.880
Oh, my God, Michelle...

19:36.200 --> 19:38.200
In fact, shall we show them
a bit of it?

19:38.200 --> 19:39.600
Oh, I don't know.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.840
I mean... What?

19:41.840 --> 19:43.840
What do you reckon?

19:43.840 --> 19:45.800
Ian, would you like to see
a bit of it?

19:45.800 --> 19:48.160
No.
Yes!

19:48.160 --> 19:49.360
Come on.

19:49.360 --> 19:50.960
Let's get that iPod on.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.120
No, Cathy.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.000
Just wait, wait, wait.
Cathy, no.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.440
Shut up, Michelle.

19:57.760 --> 20:01.400
MUSIC: Move Closer,
by Phyllis Nelson

20:06.680 --> 20:08.200
Get oot the way!

20:11.200 --> 20:12.880
Do you remember it, Col?

20:12.880 --> 20:14.200
Oh, aye.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.520
# Hey, baby

20:24.520 --> 20:26.040
# You go your way

20:28.120 --> 20:30.120
# And I'll go mine

20:32.160 --> 20:33.920
# But in the meantime

20:35.160 --> 20:37.280
# When we're together

20:40.920 --> 20:43.200
# Touching each other... #

20:45.960 --> 20:47.520
Oh, for God's sake!

20:47.520 --> 20:50.280
# And our bodies

20:53.120 --> 20:56.960
# Do what we feel

20:59.000 --> 21:02.320
# When we're dancing... #

21:02.320 --> 21:03.720
Fuck me.

21:06.240 --> 21:09.200
All the staff had come out the
kitchen by this point.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.880
Aye. A lot of them
had their cameras out.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.680
Oh, for goodness' sake!

21:15.680 --> 21:19.560
The Doncaster mob, they were really
egging her on, you know.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.320
MUSIC STOPS

21:24.920 --> 21:27.040
We were just getting to
the good bit!

21:27.040 --> 21:28.720
Sorry, is there a problem, Michelle?

21:28.720 --> 21:31.160
I think we've all seen enough,
Cathy.

21:31.160 --> 21:34.000
What? Well, this is Beth and Eric's
night, isn't it?

21:36.840 --> 21:38.560
HE SIGHS

21:41.560 --> 21:45.880
So, your dress was absolutely
beautiful, Beth.

21:45.880 --> 21:47.120
Thank you, Michelle.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.600
Did you buy it, or...?

21:48.600 --> 21:50.240
Yes, yes, I bought it.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.440
Still got it.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.640
Have you?
Yeah.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.440
Cath chucked hers, didn't you?

21:55.440 --> 21:56.520
You chucked it?

21:56.520 --> 21:58.120
Well, I was going to keep it,

21:58.120 --> 22:01.080
but we were up to 24kg
with all the cigarettes,

22:01.080 --> 22:03.360
so I dumped it at the airport.

22:05.640 --> 22:08.040
I'd love to see your dress, Beth.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.640
It's upstairs in the wardrobe.

22:09.640 --> 22:12.080
Is it?
Somewhere.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.440
Away and get it, Beth.
Bring it doon.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.200
On you go, Beth.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.280
So, the old wedding dress, eh?

22:32.280 --> 22:34.160
Been a while since you've seen
that, eh?

22:34.160 --> 22:35.400
Aye, it is indeed.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.720
Is it the old traditional white,
is it?

22:37.720 --> 22:39.800
Aye. Aye. That's what women like,
isn't it?

22:39.800 --> 22:42.600
Aye. Is that what Cathy had?
Aye, hers was white.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.840
Well, it was at the start
of the night!

22:52.880 --> 22:55.120
See on your wedding night?

22:55.120 --> 22:56.840
Had you and Beth...?

22:56.840 --> 22:58.080
Had you ever...?

22:59.480 --> 23:02.000
Had you lain with her before?

23:02.000 --> 23:03.600
What?

23:03.600 --> 23:06.440
Were you familiar with
each other's bodies?

23:07.360 --> 23:09.000
Well...

23:09.000 --> 23:10.360
..aye.
Really?

23:10.360 --> 23:12.560
Aye.
See my first wife?

23:12.560 --> 23:15.600
She'd never done it.
Really? Aye.

23:15.600 --> 23:16.720
But Cathy had?

23:16.720 --> 23:18.200
Oh, aye, Cathy had, but...

23:18.200 --> 23:20.800
OK, here we are.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.320
Oh!

23:22.320 --> 23:24.600
See, she's like me, Michelle.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.680
Throws nothing away.

23:26.680 --> 23:29.480
I've got an old Puma tracksuit
that I keep to wear

23:29.480 --> 23:31.640
for when I've got an upset stomach.

23:31.640 --> 23:32.920
Oh, wow!

23:32.920 --> 23:35.280
I've not seen this for a while.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.480
You're not that interested
in weddings, really, are you?

23:38.480 --> 23:40.200
Hold it up, let's see it properly.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.400
Aye. You scrubbed up all right.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.680
Can I see it?
Oh, Beth, put it on.

23:45.680 --> 23:46.920
No!

23:46.920 --> 23:49.720
Come on, put it on,
give us all a laugh.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.640
She'll never get into it, Cath.

23:51.640 --> 23:54.680
Well, yes, it might be a bit
on the tight side.

23:54.680 --> 23:57.920
Never mind, put it back in the bag
and chuck it in the cupboard.

23:57.920 --> 24:00.560
Oh, it's beautifully made.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.440
It's the kind of thing I'd go for.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.920
Quite simple.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.160
Why don't you put it on, then?
Sorry?

24:06.160 --> 24:07.920
You try it on, you'll fit into it.

24:07.920 --> 24:10.920
No, it's Beth's dress,
it's a personal thing.

24:10.920 --> 24:14.680
Och, it's just a dress, Michelle.
It's no as if you're trying on

24:14.680 --> 24:17.720
a swimsuit and you've got to check
the hygiene strip.

24:19.160 --> 24:21.360
Is it because you've got
no pants on, Michelle?

24:21.360 --> 24:23.320
No!
How come you've no got knickers on?

24:23.320 --> 24:25.080
I do have knickers on!

24:25.080 --> 24:27.480
Just go into the wee toilet there,
no-one will see.

24:27.480 --> 24:30.960
Aye, go into the wee loo.
Let's see it on you. Come on.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.480
You can if you want.

24:33.960 --> 24:36.080
Come on!
Really?

24:38.320 --> 24:39.720
OK.

24:39.720 --> 24:42.200
THEY CHEER

24:45.160 --> 24:48.120
Well, I don't know
about anybody else,

24:48.120 --> 24:51.760
but I am definitely ready
for a bit of this trifle.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.800
Colin?
Good idea.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.120
Alan?
Aye.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.200
Eric?

24:56.200 --> 24:58.280
No need to ask. Boys?

24:58.280 --> 25:00.600
Well...
Oh, yeah, good idea.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.320
Let's do trifle.

25:02.320 --> 25:05.400
Let's all have a bowl of lovely
fucking trifle.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.160
Is he OK?

25:15.160 --> 25:17.560
There's sherry in it, Alan.

25:17.560 --> 25:20.560
Vintage sherry.
Aye? Aye.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.240
I had to use a pair of pliers
to get the lid off.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.520
Here we are!

25:28.680 --> 25:30.880
Trifle in there.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.920
Trifle in there!

25:33.960 --> 25:35.400
Trifle in there.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.760
Oh, bit on the table.
Who gives a shit?

25:39.800 --> 25:41.960
Gordon, would you like a hand there?

25:41.960 --> 25:44.920
No, no, it's fine. Here you are.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.000
Here you go.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.880
For you.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.600
Not for me, thanks.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.680
Gordon.
Yes?

25:58.680 --> 26:00.720
Any spoons?
Spoons?

26:03.680 --> 26:05.840
Do you really need a spoon?

26:05.840 --> 26:07.840
Unless I'm gonnae
stick my head in the bowl

26:07.840 --> 26:10.440
and snort it through my
fucking nose, aye.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.520
What do you think?

26:18.520 --> 26:20.360
Oh, Michelle!

26:20.360 --> 26:23.640
Oh, come in,
let's have a proper look at you.

26:23.640 --> 26:25.280
It actually fits me.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.000
It's a bit tight, no?

26:27.000 --> 26:28.400
You look lovely, pet.

26:28.400 --> 26:31.520
Aye, that quite suits you,
Michelle.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.840
Oh, aye, that's good, aye.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.520
Do you think?
Aye.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.240
You'd better watch, Michelle.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.320
You'll have him down on one knee
before you know it.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.800
LAUGHTER

26:41.800 --> 26:44.880
Alan, Alan...
What?

26:44.880 --> 26:46.560
You could propose to Michelle!

26:46.560 --> 26:48.160
Cathy...
Go on!

26:48.160 --> 26:49.760
For God's sake, Cathy.

26:49.760 --> 26:52.160
Put your trifle down
and ask her to marry you!

26:52.160 --> 26:54.760
No, no, no, look...
Down on the rug! Come on

26:54.760 --> 26:56.840
Alan, Alan, wedding, wedding.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.960
No, Alan, look,
we're not doing this right now.

26:58.960 --> 27:01.040
Alan, Alan, she wants you to,
really.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.360
I don't!

27:02.360 --> 27:03.600
Alan, Come on.

27:03.600 --> 27:06.040
On one knee.
Alan, please don't do this.

27:06.040 --> 27:07.640
Down on one knee!

27:07.640 --> 27:09.240
Alan, not like this.

27:09.240 --> 27:10.920
There's the beautiful bride.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.800
Alan...
One, two, three...

27:15.960 --> 27:17.240
Will you marry me?

27:18.400 --> 27:19.440
Yes, but...

27:19.440 --> 27:20.480
Hurray!

27:20.480 --> 27:22.440
Oh!
Where are you going?

27:22.440 --> 27:25.000
I'm taking this fucking thing off,
and then we're going home.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.480
Michelle!

27:32.480 --> 27:33.920
Michelle!

27:35.920 --> 27:37.400
Trifle.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.320
Where is it?

27:41.320 --> 27:42.720
Aha!

27:42.720 --> 27:45.120
MUSIC: Let's Get Married,
by The Proclaimers

27:45.120 --> 27:48.280
Oh, Gordon!
Would anybody like to dance?

27:48.280 --> 27:50.960
No takers? Never mind!

27:53.080 --> 27:55.200
Yeah, Gordy!

27:55.200 --> 27:57.840
SHE LAUGHS

27:57.840 --> 27:59.520
Oh, look!

28:04.600 --> 28:07.560
Gordon! Naughty!

28:17.040 --> 28:19.240
Whoo! Yeah!

28:27.600 --> 28:29.040
This is off.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.640
Work it.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.800
Oh, for fuck's sake.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.960
SHE SIGHS

28:44.640 --> 28:48.800
# Let's get married
C'mon darlin', please take my hand

28:48.800 --> 28:52.040
# C'mon darlin', please take my hand

28:52.040 --> 28:55.240
# C'mon darlin',
please take my hand. #
