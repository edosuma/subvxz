<i>Previously on Strike Back...</i>

00:01.580 --> 00:04.345
- I want to help you.
- You? Can help me?

00:04.350 --> 00:06.410
To find Al-Zuhari.
To stop him.

00:08.010 --> 00:09.840
- Mike, you all right?
- Shit.

00:10.300 --> 00:13.300
Were you to meet Al-Zuhari?

00:13.310 --> 00:15.270
- Sofia.
- Where's my husband?

00:15.305 --> 00:16.870
He's truly sorry.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.445
You've done it.
He's here, Rachel.

00:20.480 --> 00:23.100
<i>Rachel, get out of that house now.</i>

00:24.380 --> 00:25.770
Mairead MacKenna.

00:26.150 --> 00:28.410
What the fuck is the real IRA
doing in the middle of this?

00:28.445 --> 00:30.825
They spotted MacKenna.
She's heading for Budapest.

BUDAPEST, HUNGARY

01:07.120 --> 01:09.020
Still playing soldiers, huh?

01:09.440 --> 01:11.700
Haven't you heard?
The war's over.

01:12.130 --> 01:13.880
You're here, aren't you?

01:20.170 --> 01:22.100
We're planning something big.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.230
Better keep that to
yourself then, huh?

01:27.720 --> 01:29.510
Derry man obviously.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.380
Born and bred.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.895
Earth to earth,

01:35.930 --> 01:39.410
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

01:40.210 --> 01:44.960
We therefore commit the body
of Rachel Dalton to the ground

01:45.690 --> 01:48.435
in the sure and certain hope

01:48.470 --> 01:51.280
of resurrection to eternal life.

Package is being delivered.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.730
You have something for us?

02:13.170 --> 02:15.580
Here.
My Hungarian clients

02:15.600 --> 02:17.870
will be collecting their
shipment tomorrow night.

02:25.890 --> 02:28.990
You sure put your heart and soul
into your work, special agent.

02:29.830 --> 02:32.760
Don't they say, "If you're
gonna do something, do it right"?

02:33.430 --> 02:36.220
- Yes, I think... I think
they do say that. - OK.

02:36.700 --> 02:39.172
This contains a video file.

02:39.175 --> 02:42.650
You have got the connections.
See they get it.

02:43.340 --> 02:46.200
These guys like to see their
faces on the telly, all right?

02:46.860 --> 02:49.950
- I have a new life out here.
I can't... - You will do this.

02:51.870 --> 02:53.630
You heard the man.

02:56.390 --> 02:59.230
- When?
- You will know.

03:11.510 --> 03:14.120
Don't turn round.
Keep your mouth shut.

03:21.190 --> 03:24.580
- Long time no see, Sean.
- Where the fuck did you come from?

03:25.100 --> 03:26.610
Out of the past.

04:52.338 --> 04:55.750
STRIKE BACK 4x05
Sub: dcdah; Edited: Szaki

05:07.460 --> 05:10.760
- You're getting rusty, Sean.
- I'm legit now.

05:12.050 --> 05:15.900
- I'm a businessman.
- Of course you are.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.940
All those years running
guns into Belfast,

05:19.470 --> 05:21.900
and now you supply from Budapest.

05:23.100 --> 05:27.980
So tell me, who's on your
Christmas card list these days...

05:28.230 --> 05:31.090
- Al-Zuhari?
- Never heard of him.

05:33.070 --> 05:35.620
- What about Mairead McKenna?
- Who?

05:35.790 --> 05:39.780
Soon as we knew she was headed for Budapest,
we pulled your phone records, Sean.

05:40.690 --> 05:43.150
She rang you from
Beirut two days ago.

05:45.230 --> 05:47.710
You're playing a very
dangerous game, Sean.

05:59.490 --> 06:00.930
O'Riordan!

06:00.965 --> 06:02.370
Hey! Fuck off!

06:04.130 --> 06:05.780
Get back, or I'll shoot.

06:05.870 --> 06:07.320
Contain!

06:07.510 --> 06:09.000
I'm warning youse!

06:09.300 --> 06:11.240
Get the fuck away from me!

06:11.275 --> 06:13.540
- Go, go, go.
- Remember, we need him alive!

06:17.190 --> 06:18.510
Hurry!

06:21.300 --> 06:22.685
Irish, oi, oi!

06:22.700 --> 06:24.830
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Look, look, look.

06:24.865 --> 06:26.925
- We just want to talk.
- Back off.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.310
- No. Hey. We just want to talk.
- Back off!

06:32.510 --> 06:34.965
- Get off me, you...
- Can I have your wig?

06:36.700 --> 06:39.445
- Right here! Oi, fella!
- Get that thing off me!

06:39.630 --> 06:41.220
- I love you, buddy.
- He's getting married.

06:41.225 --> 06:42.500
- Shall we?
- Yeah. Go.

06:42.510 --> 06:43.960
No! No!

06:44.360 --> 06:45.670
There you go.

06:45.820 --> 06:47.095
OK, ok!

06:47.130 --> 06:49.500
- You want to die in a green wig?
- Come on, Sean.

06:49.540 --> 06:51.990
- Come on.
- I said just please get me up.

06:52.025 --> 06:53.370
Yeah, all right.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.610
Come on, Sean. Talk
to me about McKenna.

06:55.645 --> 06:58.505
- I only dealt with her crew.
- And what did they want?

06:58.540 --> 07:01.160
Same thing they always want...
weapons and explosives.

07:01.195 --> 07:02.710
Mm-hmm. More, more.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.377
- That's your lot.
- Back over.

07:05.412 --> 07:06.485
No, no!

07:06.520 --> 07:09.585
- There you go, buddy. Like that?
- All right. I pointed them at arms shipment

07:09.620 --> 07:12.870
coming into the switching yard
tomorrow night in Pest.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.040
McKenna's going to ambush it.

07:15.180 --> 07:17.160
Why the fuck did McKenna
kill Rachel Dalton?

07:17.165 --> 07:18.577
Who the fuck is Rachel Dalton?

07:18.582 --> 07:21.410
- Where can we find McKenna?
- She'll be there tomorrow night.

07:21.510 --> 07:23.290
Yeah. Up you go.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.460
Now you wouldn't lie
to me, would you, Sean?

07:25.590 --> 07:27.120
I have grandchildren.

07:27.590 --> 07:29.780
I swear to God it's
the honest truth.

07:31.380 --> 07:33.160
- Search him.
- Yes, sir.

07:34.020 --> 07:36.800
- Get your fucking hands off of me!
- Calm down, calm down.

07:36.837 --> 07:38.830
Let's go for a walk.

07:39.770 --> 07:41.560
Let's take a walk, big fella.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.010
Kelly green giant, huh?

07:44.610 --> 07:46.200
How you doing, folks?

07:47.690 --> 07:50.185
- Boss!
- Ah, don't be silly, Sean.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.540
Stupid fucker.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.290
I'm out.

07:58.550 --> 08:00.030
Shit.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.720
BRITISH EMBASSY, BUDAPEST

08:16.725 --> 08:19.360
You're not gonna chicken out on
me with those diamonds, are you?

08:19.380 --> 08:22.960
- I don't know. - Come on, Mikey.
They're bad guy diamonds.

08:23.520 --> 08:26.960
You hand them in, and our guys are gonna
give them back to the Lebanese authorities,

08:26.970 --> 08:29.575
who are probably gonna
give them back to Hezbollah.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.320
They're just gonna buy more
guns and kill more of our guys.

08:32.355 --> 08:35.515
Well... So... we're
just breaking the cycle.

08:35.549 --> 08:38.159
- Yeah. We're just doing everyone
a favor, aren't we? - Exactly.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.690
- It's a messed up world.
- It certainly is.

08:42.059 --> 08:45.470
Yeah. Speaking of which,

08:45.480 --> 08:48.560
saw you and Martinez out there
having a little smoochy smooch.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.137
- Just maintaining my cover, mate.
- Really? - Yeah.

08:51.172 --> 08:52.665
- Doing a very good job.
- Oh. Well, cheers.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.700
Glad to see you're finally
getting some action.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.375
Identification, gentlemen.

08:57.410 --> 08:59.015
Uh, hang on.
We're with...

08:59.020 --> 09:00.880
Sergeants Scott and Stonebridge?

09:00.920 --> 09:02.300
Her.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.625
<i>Stop, please.</i>

09:04.630 --> 09:07.630
- And you are?
- Out of your league.

09:07.665 --> 09:09.185
Natalie Fisher.

09:09.220 --> 09:11.070
We've set up your facility
in the embassy ballroom.

09:11.105 --> 09:13.060
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.770
Two of yours, I believe.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.310
How was it?

09:32.370 --> 09:35.560
Bleak. The IRA give their
dead a better sendoff.

09:35.615 --> 09:39.390
- Yeah. I still think we should have been there.
- Sadly we don't get to choose where we're sent.

09:39.600 --> 09:42.530
- She had a son.
- No shit.

09:42.550 --> 09:44.890
- Did you know?
- No. Not until after.

09:45.040 --> 09:48.340
- We'll do what we can for the boy.
- What, because the army won't, right?

09:49.220 --> 09:52.420
They're not the first family to pay
the price for what we do, Michael.

09:53.330 --> 09:54.130
Sir.

09:54.210 --> 09:55.730
Coming online.

09:56.430 --> 09:57.535
- Hey, kid.
- Hi.

09:57.930 --> 10:01.235
- How you doing?
- Uh, not good. Nicotine gum.

10:01.330 --> 10:03.250
That shit doesn't work.
Try something else.

10:03.285 --> 10:04.810
How's Switzerland?

10:04.840 --> 10:07.700
Uh, it's a bit boring.
There's no gun battles.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.480
Aw. I miss you guys.

10:10.490 --> 10:13.320
Yeah. Mom here has been crying
into her pillow every night.

10:13.325 --> 10:14.770
Yeah, it's true.

10:14.940 --> 10:16.340
And you?

10:17.741 --> 10:19.761
- I miss you a little.
- A lot.

10:20.470 --> 10:22.775
- Ok.
- Oh. I'll see you later.

10:22.805 --> 10:24.370
- Bye-bye.
- See you.

10:24.405 --> 10:27.125
- Close the door.
- Glad you could join us, Leo.

10:27.380 --> 10:30.690
We've decrypted the media
file found on O'Riordan's body.

10:32.630 --> 10:35.490
<i>The attack you have
witnessed in Europe today...</i>

10:35.525 --> 10:36.595
Al-Zuhari.

10:36.630 --> 10:39.480
<i>you have brought
on your own heads.</i>

10:39.680 --> 10:42.990
<i>On the anniversary of
the martyrdom of Imam Ali,</i>

10:43.025 --> 10:44.850
<i>Alayahis Salam,</i>

10:44.970 --> 10:49.610
<i>you have tasted what we
must live with every day.</i>

10:49.820 --> 10:54.340
<i>Until your governments
withdraw from all lands</i>

10:54.375 --> 10:56.347
<i>where you are unwanted,</i>

10:56.382 --> 10:58.285
<i>we and our brothers</i>

10:58.320 --> 11:01.625
<i>from oppressed
nations of this earth</i>

11:01.660 --> 11:05.200
<i>will rain the fire of
Allah on your heads.</i>

11:06.500 --> 11:07.930
Fuck you, too.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.550
Kamali, this is for broadcast
after an attack, right?

11:12.585 --> 11:15.405
Yeah, and at most,
we have 48 hours.

11:15.440 --> 11:18.185
The holy day he refers
to is on Wednesday.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.920
So we have an IRA man with
an Al-Zuhari communiqué

11:20.935 --> 11:23.580
and an arms shipment
that's about to be ambushed.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.890
Leo, I need you here.

11:27.170 --> 11:29.635
It's difficult.
Ester...

11:29.670 --> 11:32.100
No. I need you here, Leo.

11:32.510 --> 11:35.030
- I'll make arrangements.
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.630
All right. Listen up.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.560
This isn't just a terrorist attack.

11:39.770 --> 11:42.250
What we're looking at here
has been every operative's

11:42.252 --> 11:44.420
worst nightmare
for the last decade...

11:44.555 --> 11:46.920
the old enemy are joining
hands with the new.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.710
So we prevent McKenna from
getting hold of those weapons,

11:50.745 --> 11:52.930
we find out what
Al-Zuhari's playing at,

11:53.480 --> 11:55.220
and we stop it.

12:51.421 --> 12:52.721
- Köszönöm szépen.
- Fiver.

12:52.752 --> 12:54.092
Afternoon!

12:54.100 --> 12:55.640
Yo. There you go.

12:57.950 --> 13:00.215
- Snooze you lose.
- We should drink to that.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.000
That's what
we should drink to.

13:02.220 --> 13:03.420
Enjoy.

13:04.920 --> 13:08.920
- Is that what we're gonna drink to?
- We should drink to Dalton.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.440
She was one of us.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.030
God. Heh. Really?

13:12.620 --> 13:14.290
You fucking kidding me?

13:14.750 --> 13:16.780
She treated you like shit,

13:17.220 --> 13:19.865
and God knows how many times
she nearly got all of us fucking killed.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.010
Damian, if maybe we could
go through our time, maybe...

13:22.045 --> 13:23.520
Oh, come on, dude.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.390
We were always there, we
all fucking carried her.

13:27.510 --> 13:29.960
Yeah. I know she's
got a little kid,

13:30.820 --> 13:32.680
and I'm really sorry
for that little boy.

13:33.960 --> 13:37.160
I'd be a fucking liar if I said
I wasn't glad she wasn't here.

13:39.540 --> 13:42.380
Sorry. Next round's on me.

13:54.381 --> 13:57.081
Szia! Ez az elsõ alkalom itt?
(Is this your first time here?)

13:57.360 --> 14:00.480
I'm sorry. I don't speak Hungarian.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.220
Haven't see you before.

14:04.330 --> 14:05.980
First time in the city.

14:06.490 --> 14:08.440
Do you work here in Budapest?

14:08.475 --> 14:11.020
- Embassy.
- A diplomat.

14:11.870 --> 14:14.130
Wow! That must be glamorous.

14:16.010 --> 14:18.110
What exactly is it you do?

14:18.160 --> 14:21.515
Endless receptions,
being hit on by

14:21.550 --> 14:24.780
overexcited businessmen
away from home.

14:25.510 --> 14:27.740
Every girl's dream, huh?

14:41.941 --> 14:43.241
Hey.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.000
Hey.

14:48.300 --> 14:51.190
You were right about Dalton.

14:55.850 --> 14:57.150
Thanks.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.240
Old girlfriend?

15:05.030 --> 15:06.380
Yeah.

15:07.090 --> 15:10.350
She could have got
married, changed her name.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.680
Yeah.

15:13.970 --> 15:17.220
Look. Leave it with me.

16:06.260 --> 16:08.480
Things we do
for our country, eh?

16:10.170 --> 16:12.060
Whatever it takes.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.610
You're a wee darling,
aren't you?

18:08.090 --> 18:09.490
I'm sorry.

19:06.341 --> 19:08.585
SWITCHING YARD, BUDAPEST

19:08.590 --> 19:11.700
We know Al-Zuhari is
planning an imminent attack.

19:11.810 --> 19:13.850
The arms shipment
O'Riordan told us about

19:13.885 --> 19:15.620
arrives by train tonight.

19:15.710 --> 19:19.120
If we don't stop McKenna's crew
getting their hands on those weapons,

19:19.310 --> 19:22.835
we lose the only lead we
have of the Al-Zuhari attack,

19:22.870 --> 19:26.360
so Colombia, Beirut will
all have been for nothing.

19:26.690 --> 19:30.050
Guys, I need you on that train
before it reaches Budapest.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.375
Martinez, you'll be waiting for them
at the switching yard, OK?

19:34.860 --> 19:38.320
Bring me back McKenna alive.

19:43.690 --> 19:45.150
There she is.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.790
All right.

19:47.130 --> 19:49.915
- I'm Butch, and you're Sundance.
- Sundance was faster.

19:49.950 --> 19:51.860
Yeah, but Butch
was better looking.

19:52.550 --> 19:54.640
Yeah, but Sundance
got the girl.

19:55.920 --> 19:59.380
Good point.
You can't be Sundance.

19:59.415 --> 20:02.407
- All right. Get the last car?
- Yeah. That's us, that's us.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.940
Yeah. No one in here.

20:08.050 --> 20:10.210
Bravo Two, are you in position?

20:11.490 --> 20:14.110
There's two hobos on
board and on the way.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.890
Roger. Sat coming online now.

20:17.690 --> 20:20.860
Oi. Do you think Butch and
Sundance die at the end?

20:22.820 --> 20:25.325
No, dude. They lived.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.410
Just two men against
the entire Bolivian army.

20:30.240 --> 20:31.890
Been there and done that, huh?

20:33.520 --> 20:35.940
Well, they definitely lived.

20:38.260 --> 20:40.390
They never found the bodies.

20:40.530 --> 20:43.100
So those two just disappeared
with all that loot.

20:43.890 --> 20:44.850
Yeah.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.515
You know, sometimes,

20:47.550 --> 20:49.490
you got to know
when you got to go.

20:50.430 --> 20:55.089
All right. Let's get
the diamonds valued

20:55.189 --> 20:57.080
but just out of
curiosity, that's all.

20:57.550 --> 21:00.830
God knows, if we fall on our faces,
nobody's gonna pick us up.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.060
That much is clear.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.500
In position. Over.

21:15.580 --> 21:18.510
Roger. Any activity? Over.

21:18.630 --> 21:20.440
<i>Negative. Out.</i>

21:36.220 --> 21:38.250
Hungarians are making the pickup.

21:41.461 --> 21:43.691
Let's unload
and get out of here!

21:46.422 --> 21:48.492
Come on, hurry up!

21:52.460 --> 21:54.240
Mikey, I'm moving.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.970
Good luck.

22:00.301 --> 22:02.227
Unload them quickly!

22:04.528 --> 22:06.128
Bring me that crate!

22:13.875 --> 22:15.485
That's what we paid for!

22:18.960 --> 22:21.130
They've got some
heavy-duty shit here.

22:21.860 --> 22:23.900
There's no sign
of the Irish guys.

22:24.650 --> 22:27.990
Hold up. I got a sniper at my 12

22:28.450 --> 22:29.970
up on that bridge.

22:31.510 --> 22:33.535
Good position if they ambush, huh?

22:33.545 --> 22:35.170
X-ray confirmed.

22:37.980 --> 22:39.365
Oh, fuck.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.120
Put your fucking hands up.

22:43.350 --> 22:45.250
Down on your knees.

22:47.621 --> 22:49.451
emelj

22:53.210 --> 22:54.630
Motherfucker.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.470
Here's the fightin' Irish.

23:23.171 --> 23:24.815
Please!

23:26.296 --> 23:28.220
Please! Don't kill me!

23:30.140 --> 23:32.585
Shit. They've finished
off the Hungarians.

23:32.590 --> 23:34.850
Come on! Cops will be
all over this place soon!

23:34.905 --> 23:37.180
I got a clear shot
at our primary target.

23:37.205 --> 23:39.790
Put it in the lorry.
Where the fuck's Liam?

23:41.510 --> 23:43.365
Two of her crew
are Middle Eastern.

23:43.400 --> 23:46.600
Wait here. Move those
guns now! Quickly!

23:46.635 --> 23:48.100
Target's on the move.

23:48.720 --> 23:52.360
If you can, take her
alive, Bravo Two.

23:53.690 --> 23:54.395
Copy that.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.555
Move the fuck out!
You on fucking holiday?

23:56.560 --> 23:58.628
- Come on. Let's go!
- Let's shift this.

23:58.630 --> 24:01.390
Move it!
Come on. Let's go.

24:12.060 --> 24:13.790
Shit! Liam!

24:18.000 --> 24:20.240
- Fuck.
- Who the fuck's firing?

24:26.460 --> 24:27.750
No!

24:30.090 --> 24:31.810
<i>Target acquired.</i>

24:32.200 --> 24:34.500
Get the truck and take us out!

24:34.535 --> 24:36.342
Move it! Get out of here!

24:36.377 --> 24:38.150
Get the truck, get the truck!

24:41.240 --> 24:42.880
<i>Boss, they're on the move.</i>

24:43.400 --> 24:45.280
The weapons are on the truck.

24:48.930 --> 24:51.490
<i>Do not let them get
away with those weapons.</i>

24:51.525 --> 24:52.780
Are you fucking kidding me?

24:57.460 --> 24:58.590
Go, Mikey!

25:10.370 --> 25:11.710
Take the shot.

25:13.890 --> 25:15.140
Come on.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.660
Take the shot.

25:23.150 --> 25:24.540
Fuck.

25:31.220 --> 25:32.660
Shit.

25:36.540 --> 25:37.970
Shit.

25:40.025 --> 25:42.943
BRITISH EMBASSY, BUDAPEST

25:49.380 --> 25:51.205
Any news on the arms truck?

25:51.240 --> 25:55.245
Nothing yet. Local police
have been alerted, an GCHQ...

25:55.280 --> 25:57.850
We all miss sometimes, Mikey.
Happens to the best of us.

25:57.885 --> 26:00.420
Yeah? Well, I had it.

26:01.820 --> 26:04.450
Don't be too hard on yourself, dude.
It was dark, it was a moving target.

26:04.485 --> 26:06.780
I said I fucking had it, Scott.

26:11.340 --> 26:14.550
So you just felt like
getting a checkup, huh?

26:14.585 --> 26:15.615
Yes. Yeah.

26:15.650 --> 26:19.620
You must be the first man in history
to voluntarily visit a doctor.

26:19.660 --> 26:21.380
It's just been
a while, that's all.

26:21.385 --> 26:25.671
Routine blood sample. Results will be
passed to your CO in a couple of days.

26:30.150 --> 26:32.100
Something bothering you,
sergeant?

26:33.720 --> 26:35.360
No. No, nothing.

26:36.770 --> 26:38.920
Anxiety, mood swings?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.020
No, no, not that
I can think of.

26:43.350 --> 26:47.890
I used to be Territorial
Army, two tours, Iraq.

26:51.260 --> 26:54.020
My number. Any time
you want to talk.

27:16.090 --> 27:17.500
Go on.

27:30.580 --> 27:32.295
Back in the day,
the IRA used to

27:32.300 --> 27:34.930
concentrate their minds
on an invisible flame

27:34.965 --> 27:36.690
to resist interrogation.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.900
You mean torture.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.400
It wasn't the yanks
invented waterboarding.

27:50.120 --> 27:52.680
You were using it
on us 40 years ago.

27:53.340 --> 27:55.740
"Us"? That's interesting.

27:59.430 --> 28:01.550
You're not IRA, Mairead.

28:03.180 --> 28:05.810
If you were, you would
know the war's over.

28:05.845 --> 28:09.035
The IRA... what
they settled for

28:09.070 --> 28:11.810
we could have had 10
years before I was born.

28:12.995 --> 28:14.610
So what are you?

28:15.380 --> 28:18.785
Oh, don't tell me.
You're the Real IRA, hmm?

28:18.820 --> 28:21.010
Do you really think
people believe that?

28:21.110 --> 28:22.700
You serve there?

28:22.750 --> 28:24.280
6 tours.

28:24.750 --> 28:28.060
Armagh, mid-eighties?

28:28.950 --> 28:30.810
You'd have met
my brother then.

28:33.460 --> 28:35.060
Or maybe not.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.660
You're still alive.

28:40.930 --> 28:43.980
What were you doing
in Beirut, hmm?

28:44.530 --> 28:47.200
You teaming up with some
like-minded jihadists?

28:47.210 --> 28:49.650
You gonna bring Sharia
law to the 6 counties

28:49.685 --> 28:52.090
and turn the North into
some Muslim caliphate?

28:52.125 --> 28:54.262
Better the Muslims
than the British.

28:54.297 --> 28:56.600
Oh, you don't really believe that.

28:57.730 --> 29:02.090
Where are your boys?
Where's the truck?

29:03.380 --> 29:06.060
When is this attack
going to take place?

29:15.490 --> 29:17.810
It was the fucking
Brits took Mairead.

29:18.300 --> 29:20.400
- Could smell the bastards.
- He's dying.

29:20.420 --> 29:22.520
So he needs a fucking priest!

29:26.770 --> 29:29.790
- The attack must go ahead.
- We'll get her out.

29:29.970 --> 29:32.080
Got connections
in the consulate.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.820
Father...

29:39.200 --> 29:42.297
- He needs the last rites, father.
- There's no time for this.

29:42.332 --> 29:44.590
Show some fucking respect!

29:48.070 --> 29:52.470
We have a problem here.
You have to clean up your mess.

29:55.910 --> 30:00.090
So tell me, Mairead,
why did you kill Major Dalton?

30:00.620 --> 30:02.360
The girl in Beirut?

30:02.820 --> 30:05.180
Bitch was in the wrong
place at the wrong time,

30:05.215 --> 30:06.915
casualty of war.

30:06.950 --> 30:09.235
And Sofia Abboud,
Al-Zuhari's wife?

30:09.240 --> 30:11.610
She could have
compromised our operation.

30:12.110 --> 30:15.200
What can you possibly get out
of working with these people?

30:15.235 --> 30:16.855
I get to see
the look on your face

30:16.890 --> 30:19.330
when you realize every
fucker you ever trod on

30:19.365 --> 30:23.380
for the past thousand years has clubbed
together and is coming back to get you.

30:28.550 --> 30:30.500
Come on.
Tell me about the target.

30:31.980 --> 30:33.770
I can keep a secret.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.150
Ask your brother.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.615
- My brother's dead.
- I know.

30:40.650 --> 30:44.042
He was picked up outside the Rock Bar
on the Falls Road by a loyalist hit squad.

30:44.077 --> 30:46.800
You've done your research.
What you want, a gold star?

30:46.835 --> 30:51.160
I was there.
Ooh. I knew your brother, Mairead.

30:52.170 --> 30:53.700
It was my job to.

30:53.860 --> 30:58.330
But you knew him personally,
you ran across him.

30:59.260 --> 31:00.870
I ran him.

31:01.520 --> 31:03.540
- What?
- You heard.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.370
Your brother was a tout.

31:06.440 --> 31:09.110
You dirty Brit bastard.

31:10.350 --> 31:12.880
My brother was worth 10 of you.

31:13.610 --> 31:16.100
He had you lot running scared,

31:16.400 --> 31:19.100
the great SAS.

31:19.930 --> 31:22.850
Everything you are you are
because of your brother,

31:23.350 --> 31:25.640
and everything
you know about him

31:26.490 --> 31:27.890
was a lie.

31:29.910 --> 31:31.470
You're the liar.

31:31.970 --> 31:33.230
Sir.

31:37.470 --> 31:39.180
Think about that.

31:40.030 --> 31:43.410
Local police just got a call
from a church in District 5.

31:43.840 --> 31:46.855
One of their priests has been kidnapped
as he gave the last rites

31:46.890 --> 31:49.240
to a man dying of gunshot wound.

31:49.440 --> 31:52.572
Seems he was brought in
by an Arab and an Irishman.

31:52.607 --> 31:55.230
- OK. Check it out.
- Yeah. Roger that.

31:55.380 --> 31:58.390
- But give the Hungarians
operational control. - Will do.

32:00.920 --> 32:04.917
The Irish Consulate has been on to
the ambassador. Get Natalie in here, will you?

32:04.952 --> 32:06.920
She didn't come in today, sir.

32:23.100 --> 32:25.390
- Hey, sergeant.
- Yeah?

32:25.590 --> 32:27.770
Want to grab dinner sometime?

32:27.900 --> 32:29.495
You know, nothing
too serious,

32:29.300 --> 32:32.290
just some good food,
fine wine, and...

32:33.050 --> 32:34.545
hot butt-naked sex.

32:34.550 --> 32:37.555
You really think now's the
time to talk about that?

32:37.590 --> 32:40.560
Well, given that we could
be dead in 60 seconds,

32:41.250 --> 32:43.810
I'd say there's no
time like the present.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.211
Befelé! (Get in!)

33:11.140 --> 33:12.570
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go! Go!

33:27.720 --> 33:28.750
You all right?

33:28.760 --> 33:31.290
- Mikey?!
- Yeah. We're all right. You OK?

33:31.325 --> 33:32.930
What the fuck was that?

33:33.120 --> 33:35.595
Oh, yeah. Francie had
us running to the bank.

33:35.630 --> 33:39.650
50 grand a year we pumped into
his account plus expenses.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.660
Still...

33:42.670 --> 33:44.440
it was money well spent.

33:52.050 --> 33:55.230
- No strings attached?
- As long as we can go Dutch.

33:55.265 --> 33:57.350
Yeah. Yeah, we can.

33:59.440 --> 34:00.840
Shit.

34:02.070 --> 34:03.920
Sneaky Irish bastards.

34:04.880 --> 34:07.680
- Yeah. Pricks.
- Yeah, dude.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.280
We got to get out
of this game, Mikey.

34:10.659 --> 34:12.745
You know, if it's not the IRA,

34:12.780 --> 34:15.159
it's just gonna be some
other fucker that gets us.

34:16.110 --> 34:19.130
Dude, that was way too close,

34:20.170 --> 34:21.659
way too fucking close.

34:21.695 --> 34:23.550
- Yeah.
- Fuck!

34:25.030 --> 34:26.500
Yes, it was.

34:27.370 --> 34:29.130
This is bullshit.

34:29.650 --> 34:32.409
Kid with a Mac could fake
this shit up in 10 minutes.

34:34.210 --> 34:36.940
Yeah? Ok.

34:39.940 --> 34:41.400
Try this.

34:43.260 --> 34:44.620
<i>Hey, Francie.</i>

34:44.679 --> 34:46.940
<i>Just a little present from
Her Majesty's Government.</i>

34:47.639 --> 34:51.130
<i>Two soldiers still walking the
streets because of you, Francie.</i>

34:51.820 --> 34:55.380
<i>Thank you. Now you
have something for me?</i>

34:58.090 --> 34:59.760
<i>An attack.</i>

35:00.820 --> 35:04.450
<i>Tonight. Police
station in Cushendall.</i>

35:07.020 --> 35:08.465
<i>Details are in there.</i>

35:08.470 --> 35:12.170
<i>Francie, good man.</i>

35:19.480 --> 35:21.070
What are you doing?

35:21.570 --> 35:25.110
The crew you're running only defer
to you because of who your brother was,

35:25.500 --> 35:27.270
who they think he was.

35:27.730 --> 35:30.880
Same reason the actual
IRA hasn't wiped you out.

35:32.120 --> 35:34.330
You're Francie
McKenna's wee sister.

35:35.610 --> 35:37.370
You're untouchable.

35:38.190 --> 35:40.650
Let's see how well that
holds when I post this

35:40.665 --> 35:42.840
on a Republican news
web site, shall we?

35:50.630 --> 35:53.850
Better a child molester than
an informer, eh, Mairead?

35:54.900 --> 35:58.040
The attack, when is it,

35:59.460 --> 36:00.930
where is it?

36:06.210 --> 36:07.820
Last chance, Mairead.

36:09.780 --> 36:11.260
Colonel Locke?

36:12.970 --> 36:14.500
A word.

36:15.860 --> 36:19.740
- Would that be the Philip Locke?
- Please.

36:23.320 --> 36:27.090
The ambassador's about to bring
a shitstorm down on your head.

36:27.430 --> 36:30.610
The Irish Consulate know
that we're holding McKenna.

36:30.645 --> 36:32.847
They're threatening to
take it to Number 10,

36:32.882 --> 36:36.475
claim we're using the embassy
as a black site for illegal renditions.

36:36.510 --> 36:40.758
She's assured them you're
going to take McKenna to London, now.

36:41.380 --> 36:42.835
Are you serious?

36:42.870 --> 36:45.960
An attack is about to take place,
and she is the only lead we have.

36:45.995 --> 36:47.760
She has to go, Philip,

36:48.420 --> 36:50.530
and it has to be official.

36:50.700 --> 36:52.100
This is bullshit.

36:52.105 --> 36:54.670
An imminent attack, and we can't
question the terrorist who's planning it

36:54.690 --> 36:56.760
because we're in the
wrong fucking country?

36:56.780 --> 36:58.905
Perhaps if your CIA
hadn't set up

36:58.940 --> 37:01.710
its own global network
of torture franchises,

37:01.745 --> 37:03.780
we wouldn't be in
this situation now.

37:03.870 --> 37:06.440
As soon as the wheels go up
on that plane, I need you lot back here.

37:06.475 --> 37:07.499
- Boss.
- Sir.

37:07.510 --> 37:11.140
How's your son, Philip?
Be what now, 20, 25?

37:13.090 --> 37:16.250
You mention my son again, and
I will kill you where you stand.

37:16.285 --> 37:18.660
- Have you got that?
- Boss.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.280
Get her in the car.

37:34.090 --> 37:37.650
- You ride with her.
- What, was it something I said?

37:43.210 --> 37:44.780
Get in.

37:55.070 --> 37:56.990
All this for me.

37:57.110 --> 37:59.380
Scare you boys, do I?

38:03.120 --> 38:06.280
Don't normally think of rain
when you think of Beirut,

38:07.170 --> 38:09.140
but I bet you do now.

38:10.110 --> 38:12.395
She begged me for her life.

38:12.530 --> 38:14.880
What was her
name... Dalton?

38:16.260 --> 38:19.570
Like all of you boys, she was
better dishing it out than taking it.

38:52.500 --> 38:56.210
OK. You know the score.
Diplomatic protocols apply.

38:56.245 --> 38:59.455
Guns in lock boxes,
the whole 9 yards.

38:59.490 --> 39:01.610
Yeah. We'll be sitting ducks.

39:10.380 --> 39:14.070
- I need to use the bathroom.
- Hmm. Nice try, sweetheart.

39:14.310 --> 39:16.470
You can do it on the plane.

39:23.490 --> 39:26.710
I'm taking a prisoner back to the U.K.
These people are seeing me on the plane.

39:26.720 --> 39:30.010
The paperwork's all here,
and our jet's on the runway over there.

39:30.130 --> 39:32.320
I need to see everyone's
passports.

39:34.610 --> 39:36.060
Thanks, Dad.

39:38.410 --> 39:40.640
There's no record
of your arrival.

39:41.460 --> 39:43.890
It was a diplomatic
flight from Beirut.

39:44.320 --> 39:46.110
She has a passport?

39:46.980 --> 39:48.530
- Oh, for God's sake.
- One minute, please.

39:48.565 --> 39:50.170
Fucking joking, right?

39:50.500 --> 39:54.150
Look. This woman is a wanted terrorist
who's being extradited to the U.K.

39:54.185 --> 39:57.030
It's been cleared.
You need to read that.

39:58.810 --> 40:02.040
I'm afraid I'm going to have to
ask you to wait here, gentlemen.

40:02.075 --> 40:05.500
- Get me on that plane, or let me
use the bathroom. - Shut the fuck up.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.960
Time of the month.
For God's sake, you're women.

40:08.995 --> 40:10.360
Just take her.

40:12.030 --> 40:13.480
Let's go.

40:45.460 --> 40:47.270
I'm gonna need these off.

40:51.800 --> 40:53.650
How am I supposed to go?

40:54.340 --> 40:55.850
You'll figure it out.

40:56.690 --> 40:58.130
It's all yours.

41:29.560 --> 41:32.490
- OK. Everything seems in order.
- About fucking time.

41:33.870 --> 41:36.000
- Let's go.
- Cheers.

41:49.370 --> 41:51.490
- Your guns, please.
- I haven't got one.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.850
Eh, just fucking with you.

41:59.430 --> 42:02.180
- Here. Don't lose it.
- Step this way, sir.

42:03.110 --> 42:04.590
Hold on.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.970
Hurry up.

42:22.220 --> 42:23.520
Right there.

42:38.130 --> 42:42.375
- Step this way. - Ha! You find
his metal dildo? - Yeah. Thanks, mate.

42:42.410 --> 42:44.820
- Where are those fucking girls?
- You can go through.

43:31.150 --> 43:32.750
Move, move, move!

43:40.160 --> 43:41.760
Come here, big guy.

43:49.990 --> 43:51.520
On the balcony, Mikey!

44:01.440 --> 44:03.260
Drop the gun. Do it.

44:03.330 --> 44:05.940
- I'm moving!
- Go, Mike!

44:10.630 --> 44:12.000
Now!

44:22.220 --> 44:23.630
Thank you.

44:35.890 --> 44:38.460
Stay there. Stay right
there. Don't move!

44:47.760 --> 44:49.220
Shit.

44:49.500 --> 44:51.090
Take the shot, Michael.

44:53.920 --> 44:56.080
Mikey, take that shot!

44:57.470 --> 44:58.840
Take it.

45:00.710 --> 45:03.290
Don't even think about it,
you fucker. You're mine!

45:03.370 --> 45:06.480
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

45:07.830 --> 45:09.890
What the fuck, Mairead?
What are you doing?

45:09.925 --> 45:11.760
Move it! Go! Now.

45:12.460 --> 45:13.240
Fuck!

45:22.710 --> 45:24.560
Go, man! Move!

45:32.520 --> 45:35.760
Julia. Fuck.

45:49.600 --> 45:51.320
Give me a fucking grenade!
