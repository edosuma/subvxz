01:07.463 --> 01:08.664
Josh?

01:09.599 --> 01:12.768
What is it?

01:26.349 --> 01:28.117
I'll drive.

01:34.891 --> 01:39.495
Computers and telecoms are up on the genny
I'll make sure that the ISD has power.

01:51.674 --> 01:55.743
I was looking for Pam, but the
sky is literally falling, Josh.

01:55.745 --> 01:57.746
Checking with my
planet to figure out why.

01:57.748 --> 02:00.714
Great. Look, could you fix your
attention on my son Ali, for a minute?

02:00.716 --> 02:05.787
No. really. You need to. Just be a
human being for one minute, alright?

02:05.789 --> 02:07.522
I'll be back, okay?

02:07.524 --> 02:09.558
- Okay.
- That's an order.

02:10.294 --> 02:11.461
Yeah.

02:15.598 --> 02:20.302
Did you know that Earth
is filled with liquid, see?

02:21.837 --> 02:24.206
It's molten iron and nickel.

02:24.307 --> 02:26.608
The fact that it's spinning,
generates a magnetic field

02:26.610 --> 02:30.413
that keeps us safe from all
kinds of space radiation.

02:34.318 --> 02:38.855
Without it, the air that
gives us the ability to live...

02:39.923 --> 02:42.324
just sputters away....

02:43.460 --> 02:45.361
into outer space...

02:45.929 --> 02:48.596
and we die.

02:48.598 --> 02:51.233
You just can't tell a baby
we're going to die, Josh.

02:51.235 --> 02:53.537
Yes, I can.
-No.

02:53.669 --> 02:56.305
Question is, what is
he going to do about it?

02:57.741 --> 02:59.342
Thank you, Pam.

02:59.776 --> 03:01.611
Oh.
- Oh.

03:01.711 --> 03:02.876
You ready for the meeting?

03:02.878 --> 03:04.747
Yeah. Ready.

03:07.918 --> 03:11.286
Anything bothering you, Pam?

03:11.288 --> 03:14.524
I'm about to get skewered,
Josh. Can you be more specific?

03:16.727 --> 03:19.793
- The solar flare happened at the same
time as those 8+ quakes. - Uh-huh.

03:19.795 --> 03:22.530
North Pole lurches over two thousand
miles in the same exact night.

03:22.532 --> 03:25.299
Oh, come on.
-Aside from the electricity being out.

03:25.301 --> 03:28.435
Tiksi, Siberia is Santa's
new home. Ho, ho, ho.

03:28.437 --> 03:30.905
- Are you sure?
- Calculated the magnetic variance myself.

03:30.907 --> 03:33.574
Pam, I think this signals
a polarity reversal.

03:33.576 --> 03:36.043
Well, it's scary, I know. But
it's not totally unprecedented.

03:36.045 --> 03:38.614
I mean, it happens, what,
every half a million years.

03:38.814 --> 03:41.750
Anthropologists believe that the
last big one, was 780,000 years ago,

03:41.752 --> 03:43.151
and that was a massive extinction event.

03:43.153 --> 03:45.887
Now, large fossil mammal records
are hard to come by, but I think...

03:45.889 --> 03:50.725
Josh! Six hundred extra high voltage power
transformers just blew across North America

03:50.727 --> 03:52.560
because of the CME we didn't see coming.

03:52.562 --> 03:54.863
All the lights are out. Everywhere.

03:54.865 --> 03:58.532
Now I need to go in there and tell the
Secretary of Energy why this isn't my fault.

03:58.534 --> 04:00.101
So, please. Can this wait?

04:00.103 --> 04:04.005
No! If this is what can happen to us
from a solar storm with a magnetic field,

04:04.007 --> 04:07.441
I've got to tell them about it.
-Oh no, Josh!

04:07.443 --> 04:08.643
You're smart.

04:08.645 --> 04:10.078
You're so smart. When you
started working here I gambled

04:10.080 --> 04:13.815
that you were totally worth it
if you filed a Title 7 against me.

04:13.817 --> 04:15.883
Is it too late to claim a harassment?

04:15.885 --> 04:18.652
So be smart enough to know you
can't just go in there and say

04:18.654 --> 04:21.789
that you <i>think</i> the earth's
outer core is slowing down.

04:21.791 --> 04:25.392
Oh, and by the way a GS-13 from Colorado
would love to just borrow the two most powerful

04:25.394 --> 04:28.029
particle colliders to see
if he could speed it up.

04:28.031 --> 04:29.430
That's not how it works, sweetie.

04:29.432 --> 04:30.832
If I tell them about the impending danger,

04:30.834 --> 04:33.034
they're going to have
to do something about it!

04:33.036 --> 04:36.605
Yeah! Like find another
practical physicist to do your job.

04:39.576 --> 04:40.644
Pam!

04:40.843 --> 04:42.444
Pam! Wait!

04:42.978 --> 04:43.746
Pam!

04:44.648 --> 04:46.816
Dammit. Dr. Cushing!

04:47.884 --> 04:49.653
What is it?

04:52.923 --> 04:54.290
I lost them.

04:54.990 --> 04:58.461
What?
-The embryos, they didn't take.

05:00.096 --> 05:01.830
Oh, Pam. I'm sorry.

05:02.365 --> 05:03.866
I'm so sorry.

05:04.134 --> 05:06.034
It just feel like it wasn't
meant to be, you know?

05:06.036 --> 05:08.071
I know. I know. I know. I know.

05:12.776 --> 05:16.713
Think about this. Maybe it's for the best.

05:18.482 --> 05:19.649
I mean...

05:20.516 --> 05:24.853
We have a lot to handle right
now and the world needs us.

05:24.954 --> 05:27.790
I need you.
-I know.

05:28.024 --> 05:30.759
Do you understand?
-Yes. -Are you listening?

05:32.095 --> 05:33.997
You want me to keep quiet.

05:35.464 --> 05:36.532
Yes.

05:37.033 --> 05:38.098
Please.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.735
You have a habit of...
-Saying what's on my mind?

05:40.737 --> 05:43.505
Pissing people off. I'm up against it.

05:43.507 --> 05:45.740
My department needs funding.
Please don't blow this for me.

05:45.742 --> 05:49.711
This reverse polarity is a serious
thing, Pam. It can be life ending.

05:49.713 --> 05:52.514
Then publish an article. Build
a consensus. I don't know.

05:52.516 --> 05:54.649
On paper no one can tell you
don't care what they think.

05:54.651 --> 05:57.050
And I can just, what, sit around and wait
for a peer review while the magnetosphere

05:57.052 --> 05:59.921
disappears above my head and
they can argue about punctuation?

05:59.923 --> 06:02.022
Then get your own meeting.

06:14.737 --> 06:16.004
A temblor?

06:17.206 --> 06:20.576
The nearest fault's in the
springs a hundred miles away.

06:22.478 --> 06:24.413
And it's inactive.

06:32.656 --> 06:35.156
Not the right day
to smell the roses, Pam.

06:35.158 --> 06:39.060
Homeland Security protocols
kicked in when the power went down,

06:39.062 --> 06:43.867
so we're going live from Camp David.
The President will be joining us.

06:44.033 --> 06:48.570
Ron, can you hear me? -Yes. Thank
you, Mr. Secretary. We are a go on our end.

06:48.572 --> 06:53.140
Terrific. My hosts at CERN
have been gracious enough to allow me

06:53.142 --> 06:57.144
the use of their hard-wired
collider control room feed.

06:57.146 --> 06:59.415
This way? Okay.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.188
Thank you for waiting.

07:05.588 --> 07:06.788
What is the status?

07:06.790 --> 07:07.923
Madam President.

07:07.925 --> 07:11.091
I'm the Director of NOAA
Space Weather, Ron Livingston,

07:11.093 --> 07:15.964
this is the Deputy Director and
satellite liaison to NASA, Pamela Cushing.

07:15.966 --> 07:19.769
She oversees the Solar Dynamic Observatory.

07:19.870 --> 07:23.072
So what happened, and why were
we caught with our pants down?

07:23.973 --> 07:30.611
The sun blasted us with three waves radiation,
ionization, and a violent coronal mass ejection.

07:30.613 --> 07:34.515
Sunspots more powerful than a
billion thermonuclear weapons,

07:34.517 --> 07:36.784
traveling at over 1,000
kilometers per second.

07:36.786 --> 07:40.988
That's what caused the spectacular
aurora borealis as far as Panama.

07:40.990 --> 07:46.760
And that's what destroyed our geodetic
satellites. As well as our power transformers.

07:46.762 --> 07:49.096
We were utterly unaware
and completely unprepared?

07:49.098 --> 07:55.069
Madam President. Space Weather predicted
heightened coronal mass ejections.

07:55.071 --> 07:59.606
The record
reflects their warnings.

07:59.608 --> 08:01.176
Well, it wasn't enough!

08:02.077 --> 08:06.079
Ma'am, if I may. We recommend
steps to mitigate the damage

08:06.081 --> 08:08.016
in case sunspots threaten the Earth again.

08:08.218 --> 08:11.952
If we directly link regional
power systems to advanced warning

08:11.954 --> 08:16.758
from Solar Dynamic Observatory. We
can build back a better infrastructure.

08:16.860 --> 08:18.761
These steps will cost money.

08:19.194 --> 08:26.002
Thankfully, our magnetic field
deflected most of the sun's discharge.

08:28.103 --> 08:33.073
My colleague and husband, Joshua
Chamberlain, from the U.S. Geological Survey,

08:33.076 --> 08:36.111
can talk about the threat
confronting our planet.

08:36.846 --> 08:37.846
Josh.

08:38.214 --> 08:39.549
Um.

08:40.783 --> 08:43.017
Hi. I'm Joshua Chamberlain
of the U.S. Geological Survey,

08:43.019 --> 08:45.987
and I'm worried about a solar
flare hitting our weakening

08:45.989 --> 08:48.355
magnetic field, Madam President.

08:48.357 --> 08:51.191
It is weakening. Dramatically.

08:51.193 --> 08:55.128
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. But...

08:55.130 --> 08:58.967
Dr. Zicree, sir. It is an honor and I
was looking forward to talking with you about

08:58.969 --> 09:01.905
the Large Hadron Collider and
helping us solve this problem.

09:02.005 --> 09:05.739
What exactly kind of problem
do you think we're having?

09:05.741 --> 09:09.209
Well, over the past millennium
our magnetic field has been

09:09.211 --> 09:11.378
decreasing by over 5% per century,

09:11.380 --> 09:15.215
and in the last 100 years
that accelerated to over 10%.

09:15.217 --> 09:19.119
I'd like to focus on preventing
mega solar storms from

09:19.121 --> 09:21.723
destroying our nations infrastructure.

09:21.725 --> 09:24.291
That is what I am talking
about, Madam President.

09:24.293 --> 09:28.161
If our magnetic field were to dwindle or
disappear entirely due to a polarity reversal,

09:28.163 --> 09:34.035
then the same storm would cause epic tectonic
dislocation and atmospheric sputtering.

09:34.037 --> 09:38.805
And the end of all human life as we know it.
Aside from just some downed power lines.

09:38.807 --> 09:40.241
- Continents sinking.
- Chamberlain.

09:40.243 --> 09:43.344
Josh, sit down. -That's why I propose
jump-starting the Earth's core.

09:43.346 --> 09:44.978
It's impossible.

09:44.980 --> 09:48.882
That's not impossible. You can use CERNS's
LHC and the Relativistic Ion Collider

09:48.884 --> 09:51.685
over at Brookhaven... -What the hell
does this have to do with sunspots?

09:51.687 --> 09:53.655
...dual singularities at both facilities,

09:53.657 --> 09:56.826
we can capitalize on the current retrofits.
-Black holes.

09:56.960 --> 10:00.795
You want to create black holes
in two particle colliders?

10:00.797 --> 10:02.729
On purpose? Are you serious?

10:02.731 --> 10:04.331
Chamberlain, that is enough.

10:04.333 --> 10:08.368
Yes. I believe the gravitons emitted,
I believe would start the dynamo effect.

10:08.370 --> 10:10.137
Getting the earth's core spinning again.

10:10.139 --> 10:12.373
Thus recharging the magnetosphere.

10:12.375 --> 10:14.675
Alright. Thank you, sir.

10:14.677 --> 10:18.079
If another solar flare hits our planet
and our magnetic field is down...

10:18.081 --> 10:21.882
If. -The earth would
turn into Mars! -Josh. Time to go.

10:21.884 --> 10:25.052
Would you please escort this man out?
-No oxygen. No life.

10:25.054 --> 10:27.254
You are through. Get
him out of here. -That's it.

10:27.256 --> 10:29.824
This is all happening right
now and nobody cares about it.

10:29.826 --> 10:32.826
Thank you. Madam President, I apologize.

10:35.865 --> 10:38.432
I can't believe those people. -What
were you thinking, Josh. -Oh, I don't know,

10:38.434 --> 10:40.133
maybe if they give a damn.

10:40.135 --> 10:41.701
I have to go back in
there and repair the damage.

10:41.703 --> 10:45.305
The damage you just did to our career.
Are you so blind that you can't see?

10:57.052 --> 10:58.687
Are you okay?

11:05.495 --> 11:07.163
No.

11:24.413 --> 11:26.848
Do you want me to keep the rest of it?

11:28.283 --> 11:30.086
You can come with me.

11:31.988 --> 11:33.856
Because the end is near?

11:35.091 --> 11:36.824
Because I can't stay.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.092
What choice do I have?

11:38.094 --> 11:40.129
You can stay and fight.

11:42.465 --> 11:44.867
I hear Texas is nice this time of year.

11:46.802 --> 11:48.435
Yeah. What time is that, exactly?

11:48.437 --> 11:49.671
Well, I don't know.

11:49.673 --> 11:52.473
Background in geology and a
presidential restraining order.

11:52.475 --> 11:56.211
I hear that gets you a six-figure
salary in the Lone Star State.

11:56.312 --> 11:57.478
Not buying it, huh?

11:57.480 --> 11:59.816
You're still not listening.

12:01.216 --> 12:04.417
They're only empowered to do
so much much. It takes time.

12:04.419 --> 12:09.324
What if we don't... What
if we don't have time?

12:10.393 --> 12:11.559
You know this could happen.

12:11.561 --> 12:13.361
Of course it can happen.

12:13.363 --> 12:16.830
The Colorado River could flood.
The big one could take Salt Lake,

12:16.832 --> 12:21.903
New York, and L.A. all in the
same day. But what about us?

12:22.572 --> 12:24.206
What about our life?

12:25.908 --> 12:33.316
If this happens, if you're right, I wanna
be in a position where I could help people.

12:34.450 --> 12:36.252
Don't you?

12:38.388 --> 12:41.357
They think... they think I'm delusional.

12:48.498 --> 12:51.033
When you think they're ready to listen,

12:51.868 --> 12:53.302
give me a call.

12:54.671 --> 12:57.273
And if this actually happens,
what are you going to do about it?

12:58.207 --> 12:59.873
I'll build a boat.

12:59.875 --> 13:02.812
And when everything
sinks, we'll float away.

13:05.581 --> 13:07.549
Away from me?

13:09.351 --> 13:10.285
It's not what I want.

13:10.287 --> 13:11.719
You want me to just drop everything because

13:11.721 --> 13:15.488
you didn't get what you want?
-We can be together! Just you and me!

13:15.490 --> 13:19.594
-You talk about your Dad not doing
anything meaningful with his life?

13:19.596 --> 13:20.929
What about you?

13:21.530 --> 13:23.196
What are you doing?

13:23.198 --> 13:25.567
Quitting. Going boating.

13:32.575 --> 13:36.410
My mother stood by my
father through his drinking.

13:36.412 --> 13:37.913
His whoring.

13:39.283 --> 13:43.019
When he was embezzling paper
clips from the requisitions office.

13:44.386 --> 13:49.324
He was left less than honorable discharge
and they cut his pension in half.

13:51.660 --> 13:54.060
Throughout all that she stood by his side.

13:54.062 --> 13:56.598
Didn't say a word.

13:57.900 --> 14:01.937
And I speak up to save the world,

14:04.474 --> 14:06.442
you laugh at me.

14:08.110 --> 14:09.278
I didn't laugh at you.

14:10.947 --> 14:14.515
I gave you a chance. I gave you a huge
chance. I put my career on the line for you.

14:14.517 --> 14:16.485
And what did you do? You blew it.

14:17.386 --> 14:19.287
Just like you're blowing it now.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.926
Yeah, well, you know what, Pam?

14:24.027 --> 14:28.264
Just burn the rest of my stuff
because it isn't gonna matter anyway.

14:31.366 --> 14:32.934
Josh?

14:40.543 --> 14:45.313
<i>Tectonic instability at the poles
has accelerated the ice caps melting, radically.</i>

14:45.315 --> 14:50.618
<i>This latest tidal wave has just swallowed the
populous portions of America's second largest city,</i>

14:50.620 --> 14:55.289
<i>overwhelming Southern California's
coastal defenses after the 7.1 earthquake </i>

14:55.291 --> 14:57.126
<i>of the coast this morning.</i>

14:58.293 --> 15:00.194
<i>While it's almost
impossible to comprehend,</i>

15:00.196 --> 15:02.162
<i>the loss of life must be staggering,</i>

15:02.164 --> 15:06.400

with the enormity of the task</i>

15:06.402 --> 15:11.439
<i>of recovering survivors as remote a
possibility as that seems.</i>

15:11.441 --> 15:14.410
<i>- The death toll, the destruction...</i>
- Hello?

15:14.576 --> 15:16.578
<i>Reporter:
The utter loss of life.</i>

15:18.081 --> 15:19.382
Yeah.

15:22.719 --> 15:24.253
Bangladesh?

15:25.721 --> 15:27.689
It's completely underwater?

15:30.393 --> 15:32.427
What about the North Pole?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.333
The magnetosphere is
registering at 11 microteslas.

15:39.335 --> 15:44.073
That's one third its
usual... and it's falling?

15:46.241 --> 15:48.144
Okay. Thank you.

16:01.289 --> 16:02.256
Michael?

16:02.258 --> 16:05.092
I need you to get me a ticket to Galveston.

16:05.094 --> 16:07.163
No. It can't be tomorrow.

16:07.330 --> 16:09.398
No. It has to be today.

16:09.664 --> 16:13.969
Charter it if you have to, but
I'm wheels up in 90 minutes.

16:14.071 --> 16:16.639
Alright. Thanks. Bye.

17:28.810 --> 17:31.246
Savory stroganoff. Josh.

17:34.483 --> 17:36.350
I thought you were gonna call?

17:36.352 --> 17:37.753
I did.

17:38.354 --> 17:40.056
You never called me back.

17:41.458 --> 17:46.095
Yeah. My hands have been full.
But looks like yours have been too.

17:47.163 --> 17:49.230
Looking forward to floating away?

17:56.271 --> 17:58.073
Look, I'm sorry. I...

17:58.574 --> 18:00.841
I didn't come here to fight with you.
-Hey if you want to stroll down

18:00.843 --> 18:03.143
memory lane, I'm a little busy.

18:03.145 --> 18:05.181
But you're more than welcome to help.

18:05.314 --> 18:08.782
I came here to tell you the
magnetosphere has weakened dramatically,

18:08.784 --> 18:09.749
and it's fading fast.

18:09.751 --> 18:13.588
I know. It was my job
to track it, remember?

18:13.722 --> 18:18.193
I still hear things. Not everybody
in Boulder thinks I'm a charlatan.

18:20.496 --> 18:22.598
I never
thought you were a charlatan.

18:30.740 --> 18:32.775
Hey! Can you pick up the pace?

18:36.612 --> 18:39.181
Did you hear about the latest solar storm?

18:39.281 --> 18:41.182
Why do you think I'm loading the boat?

18:42.817 --> 18:45.320
The official reports don't account for
saltwater's expansion coefficient in heat.

18:46.622 --> 18:49.422
Another helium energy burst
sends a flare to Earth,

18:49.424 --> 18:51.659
and all this under water.

18:53.930 --> 18:56.132
Why did you pick Galveston?

18:56.232 --> 18:58.567
People here have
survived three floods.

18:59.301 --> 19:01.903
When you tell them something
like the water's gonna rise,

19:02.238 --> 19:04.440
nobody looks at you crazy.

19:12.448 --> 19:13.916
I've missed you.

19:15.951 --> 19:18.787
Look, I didn't come
here to help you escape.

19:18.954 --> 19:21.689
I came because you can help people survive.

19:22.290 --> 19:23.556
We need you.

19:24.926 --> 19:26.728
Who's we?

19:29.999 --> 19:33.433
You left, and it hasn't
been easy without you, but

19:33.435 --> 19:35.770
I'm in a position to help people.

19:36.939 --> 19:40.375
And since it's about to hit the
fan, maybe you can help me too?

19:42.345 --> 19:44.480
How far can you make it on this thing?

19:44.580 --> 19:46.781
I mean, how long can
you make it alone, Josh?

19:49.285 --> 19:53.556
I've got enough fuel and stroganoff
to make it as far as I want.

19:53.923 --> 19:57.593
As far as how much time I've got...

19:57.792 --> 19:59.492
I don't know, Pam.

19:59.494 --> 20:01.529
How long do any of us have?

20:05.601 --> 20:07.770
You're not gonna get a better offer, Josh.

20:09.638 --> 20:11.506
This planet is all you've got.

20:19.414 --> 20:21.750
You're amazing.

20:23.385 --> 20:25.687
And you're the person I loved.

20:26.055 --> 20:32.760
And now you're here in front of me,
and I can't stand to look at you.

20:36.432 --> 20:38.866
No. No. I'm sorry.

20:39.301 --> 20:42.003
I can't. I'm sorry.

20:42.872 --> 20:43.973
I can't.

20:52.748 --> 20:53.680
Josh!

20:53.682 --> 20:54.817
Josh!

20:54.917 --> 20:56.683
Get in the car! Now!

20:56.685 --> 20:58.552
-You want to get in that? Are you insane?

20:58.554 --> 21:02.422
We're at 13 feet, you've got 60
seconds. Get on the boat. Now!

21:02.424 --> 21:04.057
- What about the boxes?
- Don't worry about that.

21:04.059 --> 21:07.428
I'll undo the lines. You
just close the open hatch!

21:07.430 --> 21:08.796
What about you?

21:08.798 --> 21:11.500
Don't worry about me.
I'll get topside. Move!

21:49.438 --> 21:50.605
Josh!

21:51.640 --> 21:53.842
Josh!

22:08.590 --> 22:09.524
Josh.

22:12.461 --> 22:13.595
Come on.

22:21.136 --> 22:22.803
I thought you were gone.

22:22.805 --> 22:24.907
I thought you were gone.

22:27.609 --> 22:30.645
Well...My knife's gone.

22:33.682 --> 22:36.115
You haven't changed much, have you?

22:36.117 --> 22:37.985
I wouldn't say that, Dr. Cushing.

22:37.987 --> 22:39.620
Oh. So is that how's it's going to be?

22:39.622 --> 22:41.587
It was fine back then. You
weren't even working for me.

22:41.589 --> 22:44.725
Yeah, well, you were hitting
on me from the next office over.

22:44.727 --> 22:47.563
Permission
to come aboard Captain?

22:50.932 --> 22:52.500
I guess.

22:52.768 --> 22:54.803
Jerk!
-Ow!

22:55.136 --> 22:57.671
You saved me. You saved my life.

22:57.673 --> 23:01.609
Well, I didn't have a lot of
time to think over my options.

23:05.713 --> 23:07.615
You still can't stand me?

23:13.721 --> 23:14.956
Right.

23:15.990 --> 23:18.558
Okay. What do we do now?

23:18.560 --> 23:20.928
Well, I tried to tell them three years ago.

23:20.930 --> 23:22.763
Okay. Well, what about now?

23:22.765 --> 23:25.966
Now?
-Yeah. -The caps are gone.

23:25.968 --> 23:29.171
The world is tearing
itself apart. Literally.

23:29.672 --> 23:32.106
The man I knew wanted to
do something about that.

23:32.942 --> 23:35.542
Fine. Play Coast Guard. We'll
pick up as many people as we

23:35.544 --> 23:37.510
can, and fill this boat up.

23:37.512 --> 23:41.783
And the sail for Boulder. I
should still be above water.

23:42.684 --> 23:44.986
Then you'll float away after all.

23:45.887 --> 23:48.154
You should have built a bigger boat.

23:48.156 --> 23:52.258
Yeah, well it turns out making six figures
in Texas was a little harder than I thought.

23:52.260 --> 23:53.927
I was unemployed.

23:53.929 --> 23:58.033
Well, whose fault is that?

24:08.844 --> 24:10.209
Pam, kill the engine.

24:10.211 --> 24:12.614
Survivors off the bow.

24:12.948 --> 24:15.782
Grab the line!

24:15.784 --> 24:18.020
Take hold of the ring!

24:18.121 --> 24:20.921
Grab my shoulders. Grab
my shoulders.

24:20.923 --> 24:22.657
Alright. I got you. Come on.

24:24.226 --> 24:26.128
<i>Mijo, mis hombros.</i>

24:27.529 --> 24:29.863
Good. Good. Come on.

24:29.865 --> 24:31.664
Is that everybody?

24:31.666 --> 24:33.868
Everybody that's left... Yes!

24:34.169 --> 24:36.269
Come inside. Come inside.

24:36.271 --> 24:40.141
If you hadn't have come on time, I don't
know what would have happened to us.

24:40.808 --> 24:42.910
You're okay, buddy. You're safe, alright?

24:42.912 --> 24:46.546
<i>Muevete!
Muevete!...</i> Thank you! Thank you!

24:46.548 --> 24:47.748
Get inside. Go ahead.

24:47.750 --> 24:50.719
We got another one coming. Over there.

24:55.057 --> 24:55.822
Hello!

24:55.824 --> 24:57.591
Where you headed?

24:57.593 --> 25:01.094
We're not really sure yet. We're
just... We're trying to help!

25:01.096 --> 25:02.763
You got food?

25:02.765 --> 25:05.565
Some.
-Alright.

25:05.567 --> 25:07.836
I'll come.

25:17.179 --> 25:18.144
Come on.

25:18.146 --> 25:20.180
Come on up. Come on up. You alright?

25:20.182 --> 25:22.518
You okay? Good.

25:23.786 --> 25:26.922
Good. There it is. Good. Come on.

25:27.823 --> 25:29.590
- You alright?
- Yeah. -Got it?

25:29.592 --> 25:31.927
Thank you.
-Alright.

25:34.229 --> 25:35.661
Sir!

25:35.663 --> 25:37.900
Step into the buoy!

25:38.968 --> 25:41.934
Put your feet in the...

25:41.936 --> 25:42.869
What?!

25:42.871 --> 25:45.238
Your feet! The life saver!

25:45.240 --> 25:47.239
What? I can't hear you!

25:47.241 --> 25:48.775
The lifesaver!

25:48.777 --> 25:50.242
I'm hard of hearing!

25:50.244 --> 25:51.913
Man.

26:03.392 --> 26:06.058
Did anyone give you
permission to turn that on?

26:06.060 --> 26:09.363
No, my phone is fried, and I'm
looking for the WiFi. -Get up.

26:09.365 --> 26:11.198
This isn't your mom's house, kid.

26:11.200 --> 26:14.934
You can't waste their power...
-Sorry, dude. Sorry. Calm down.

26:14.936 --> 26:17.338
Use some common sense.

26:23.244 --> 26:25.279
Aww, darn it!

26:26.815 --> 26:28.681
That's my lucky hat.

26:28.683 --> 26:30.652
It wasn't working for you anyway.

26:30.853 --> 26:32.385
There. You happy?

26:32.387 --> 26:34.221
God.

26:41.363 --> 26:46.802
So hey, how did you know that this flood
was coming to have a boat ready like this?

26:46.934 --> 26:49.969
I used to be a scientist
for the USGS. I tried to warn

26:49.971 --> 26:53.608
my superiors something like this
could happen. -What happened?

26:54.242 --> 26:56.243
I built a boat instead.

26:57.346 --> 26:59.179
Anybody else's ears just pop?

26:59.181 --> 27:00.046
That's funny.

27:00.048 --> 27:02.283
Why would the air pressure change?

27:04.153 --> 27:06.219
Get inside!
-What? -Get inside now! Get inside!

27:06.221 --> 27:08.255
- Come on! Move! Move! Move! It's
an ozone hole! - Your head!

27:08.257 --> 27:09.789
My gosh! Your head!
-Ah!

27:12.394 --> 27:14.128
Inside! Inside!

27:14.896 --> 27:18.966
I can feel my skull! My skin
is falling off. -Easy. Easy.

27:19.167 --> 27:21.767
What's happening? -MALE #2:
Keep that open. It's hot in here, man!

27:21.769 --> 27:23.137
- What?
- Pam.

27:25.007 --> 27:26.305
Okay. These burns are bad.

27:26.307 --> 27:28.709
Look, I took first aid
while teaching pre-school.

27:28.711 --> 27:32.045
- I don't... I don't...
- Here. See what you can do.

27:32.047 --> 27:35.748
Oh, wait, wait, wait. You don't look
good, either. -No, no. Later. I'm okay.

27:35.750 --> 27:36.816
I'll be fine.

27:38.119 --> 27:40.688
Alright. Thank you.

27:53.836 --> 27:55.303
Hey. How's it going down...

27:56.038 --> 27:57.337
Josh, you have to wear sunscreen.

27:57.339 --> 27:59.840
Yeah. There's not enough sunblock
on the planet to stop this.

27:59.842 --> 28:01.975
Have you seen this? Come on.
I got to get you down below.

28:01.977 --> 28:04.312
I can't see obstacles from down there.

28:04.813 --> 28:07.082
Look at the sky. It's grayer, isn't it?

28:07.215 --> 28:09.216
I thought it was just clouds.

28:09.317 --> 28:12.084
Those aren't clouds. That's our
oxygen leaking out of the atmosphere.

28:12.086 --> 28:14.353
Less refraction, less blue.

28:14.355 --> 28:15.723
No.

28:16.023 --> 28:17.289
It's too soon.

28:17.291 --> 28:21.327
No. Maybe this is a localized
hole. But our mid-latitude ozone

28:21.329 --> 28:23.863
is 50 percent thinner
then it was 40 years ago.

28:23.865 --> 28:25.800
It doesn't thin evenly.

28:25.933 --> 28:27.469
But if we're losing ozone...

28:29.204 --> 28:31.906
That could only mean that our atmosphere
is sputtering and leaking into outer space.

28:32.240 --> 28:35.007
It'll start slowly at first
but, then it will accelerate.

28:35.009 --> 28:37.177
And there is nothing you can do about it.

28:37.179 --> 28:39.845
What? What happened to you?

28:39.847 --> 28:43.415
You knew this was going to happen. You
had a plan. -I had a lot of things, Pam.

28:43.417 --> 28:46.253
Now, I have a boat full of guests.
-Well, could it work?

28:47.455 --> 28:50.357
The black holes on the
opposite end of the planet.

28:50.858 --> 28:53.028
I don't... I don't know.

28:53.327 --> 28:56.496
I don't know. This is all happening
a lot faster than I calculated.

28:56.498 --> 28:58.798
I honestly don't know.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.234
Alright. Well, that's not good
enough. Not by a damn sight.

29:01.236 --> 29:03.870
You're not persuading me. You're not
persuading anyone else like that. And you're

29:03.872 --> 29:06.439
Earth's last hope, Josh.
-Oh. So now you believe in me.

29:06.441 --> 29:09.277
I never didn't believe in you.

29:09.411 --> 29:12.912
I put you in front of the president
because what you had to say was important.

29:12.914 --> 29:15.548
I risked my career for you, and
you paid me back by walking out.

29:15.550 --> 29:17.150
That's not fair.

29:17.152 --> 29:18.384
Oh yeah?

29:18.386 --> 29:20.489
I still live in our old house.

29:20.855 --> 29:22.355
I still have my old job.

29:22.357 --> 29:25.124
I still have the footprints on my
back to prove it. You walked out on me.

29:25.126 --> 29:26.593
And it shouldn't have been that easy.

29:26.595 --> 29:29.362
I thought about you everyday.

29:29.364 --> 29:31.998
About us. About the children
we were supposed to have.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.235
How your parents are probably saying he's
the guy we always thought he was going to be.

29:35.237 --> 29:36.338
Stop.

29:36.439 --> 29:37.371
It's true.

29:37.373 --> 29:39.341
Think about what you said about my paper.

29:39.508 --> 29:42.609
I didn't know you'd written it.

29:42.611 --> 29:45.947
You were the only person who
read it, and you hated it.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.015
It was a bit extraneous.

29:51.486 --> 29:54.256
Well, there's the smart-ass
I fell in love with.

29:55.356 --> 29:56.892
Come on.

29:57.259 --> 29:58.794
Can you do this?

30:00.028 --> 30:03.798
There's a lot of moving pieces.
I can't do it alone. -No.

30:04.365 --> 30:05.567
You never could.

30:06.701 --> 30:09.003
So I'll set her out to
Brookhaven and the RHIC, huh?

30:09.203 --> 30:10.838
Long Island?
-Yep.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.375
Somebody there's going to have
to reprogram the firing sequence.

30:15.210 --> 30:17.479
You're not the only one with a PhD.

30:19.347 --> 30:21.316
Then I'd sail to CERN?

30:23.085 --> 30:24.553
Without you?

30:26.255 --> 30:28.390
If this boat can get you there, yeah.

30:29.523 --> 30:31.425
Then you get what you wanted.

30:35.130 --> 30:36.598
I'll go tell the others.

30:41.336 --> 30:43.838
Be careful what you wish for.

30:54.383 --> 30:56.449
We have to get to Brookhaven
as quickly as possible,

30:56.451 --> 30:59.086
or the entire planet
could suffer irreversibly.

30:59.253 --> 31:01.322
We're trying to save the world, guys.

31:03.092 --> 31:08.027
When you fished me out of water you said you'd
get me to dry land as quickly as possible.

31:08.029 --> 31:12.298
I know. But with the poles melting so
fast and tectonic displacement wiping out

31:12.300 --> 31:15.701
land masses across the globe, we
don't know where dry land actually is.

31:15.703 --> 31:17.403
And we can't afford the
time to stop and look for it.

31:17.405 --> 31:23.610
How do you know Brookhaven will still be
there if everything is bad as you say it is?

31:23.612 --> 31:26.278
Well the lab is built on one of
the highest points on the island,

31:26.280 --> 31:30.417
and they're equipped to protect the
particle collider against natural disasters.

31:30.685 --> 31:33.554
This disaster's
starting to feel supernatural.

31:34.189 --> 31:37.558
Like some kind of divine intervention.

32:00.615 --> 32:02.049
Really?

32:02.151 --> 32:04.352
You're getting a tan during the apocalypse?

32:05.487 --> 32:09.057
I thought I'd leave behind
an attractive corpse.

32:09.157 --> 32:10.491
That's not funny.

32:11.259 --> 32:13.258
What about the ozone holes?

32:13.260 --> 32:17.330
I just wanted five minutes outside.
Besides, Earl said he's got the ship

32:17.332 --> 32:20.035
and he'd warn us if the sky grays out.

32:21.002 --> 32:23.270
You know, this is kind of amazing.

32:24.506 --> 32:26.641
You planned and put all this together.

32:27.576 --> 32:31.111
There are ten people alive right
now who wouldn't be without you.

32:31.113 --> 32:33.081
Including me.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.452
You know we always made a pretty good team.

32:39.421 --> 32:43.692
You always made me see the possibilities.

32:45.359 --> 32:49.296
If I could go back and do it
over, I'd do four things different.

32:50.598 --> 32:53.600
I wouldn't shoplift condoms
in 7th grade.

32:53.602 --> 32:56.469
I think I still have one fossilized
in some velcro wallet somewhere.

32:56.471 --> 32:59.507
- No.
- Yeah.

32:59.641 --> 33:02.074
I wouldn't cheat on my SATs.

33:02.076 --> 33:04.110
How did you cheat on your SATs?

33:04.112 --> 33:06.145
Dictionary in the bathroom.

33:06.147 --> 33:09.216
Wow.
- Yeah. Yeah.

33:09.317 --> 33:10.751
I...

33:12.686 --> 33:14.655
You know I'm not good with words...

33:15.589 --> 33:17.790
I wouldn't have ordered
so much savory stroganoff.

33:20.295 --> 33:22.063
And...

33:23.632 --> 33:28.169
I would have never... never walked out you.

33:39.413 --> 33:42.150
How much longer until Brookhaven?

33:43.218 --> 33:45.351
We're doing about 38 knots.

33:45.353 --> 33:51.058
And if I can trust my MINS navigation
and still somewhat read my compass,

33:51.660 --> 33:53.327
I'd say about a day.

33:55.363 --> 33:56.663
Is that a...

33:57.365 --> 34:00.234
Is it too late to say I'm sorry?

34:02.804 --> 34:05.240
Why don't we just save the world first.

34:06.740 --> 34:09.277
It's a lot for a girl to take in.

34:14.215 --> 34:15.416
You know,

34:16.518 --> 34:19.719
I've been trapped in a
black hole for three years,

34:19.721 --> 34:22.387
in this nightmare, alone.

34:22.389 --> 34:26.260
And then you show up,

34:26.695 --> 34:30.065
and everything feels exactly how it should.

34:34.835 --> 34:35.835
So,

34:38.273 --> 34:40.775
you saved me, too. Okay?

34:53.889 --> 34:55.856
Don't get burned.

35:19.246 --> 35:20.647
You feeling okay?

35:21.282 --> 35:21.981
What?

35:21.983 --> 35:24.351
Can I help you with anything?

35:24.786 --> 35:26.688
I threw up.

35:26.887 --> 35:28.355
Okay.

35:35.329 --> 35:37.396
Mommy, can I play with your phone?

35:37.398 --> 35:39.432
- Can I play with your phone?
- -<i>Ay hijo.</i>

35:39.434 --> 35:42.670
<i>Dejame en paz. Dejame dormir, Ronny.</i>

35:43.405 --> 35:45.273
I want to play on your phone.

35:45.373 --> 35:48.708
You know what, here you go.
It's wet. It doesn't work.

35:48.710 --> 35:51.711
Nothing does, okay? Okay?

35:51.713 --> 35:56.249
Okay?! -It's fine. Hey buddy,
what's up man? How it going?

35:56.251 --> 35:58.351
Listen, can I get your help
with something really quick?

35:58.353 --> 36:00.485
I need to tie some knots in this rope,

36:00.487 --> 36:03.690
and you know, I could use a
finger just about this size.

36:03.692 --> 36:05.159
What do you say?

36:06.393 --> 36:07.293
You get some rest.

36:07.295 --> 36:08.461
Thank you.

36:08.463 --> 36:09.597
Let's go.

36:11.932 --> 36:13.633
How's he... how's he doing?

36:13.635 --> 36:15.803
Probably not going to kill him.

36:18.472 --> 36:20.708
Lots of luck.

36:24.713 --> 36:26.681
Hang in there, buddy.

36:31.920 --> 36:32.753
He...

36:32.987 --> 36:34.221
Hey you.

36:34.389 --> 36:36.391
So, you do a lot of camping?

36:37.291 --> 36:38.324
No.

36:38.326 --> 36:39.992
Mostly white water?

36:39.994 --> 36:41.429
What?

36:42.831 --> 36:45.565
With the raft, I just
figured that you got outdoors a lot.

36:45.567 --> 36:48.800
- What is this, an interrogation?
- No. Not at all.

36:48.802 --> 36:51.470
Well you just think I want to get to
know you or something... -Listen. Look.

36:51.472 --> 36:53.840
He didn't mean anything.

36:53.942 --> 36:54.974
And what's it to you?

36:54.976 --> 36:58.845
Nothing. I'm just follow
<i>tranquilo,</i> okay?

36:58.847 --> 37:00.615
Okay.

37:01.548 --> 37:04.583
Relax, man. I'm just
messing with you, alright?

37:04.585 --> 37:05.651
What's your name?

37:05.653 --> 37:06.920
Phil?

37:07.021 --> 37:09.454
Are you asking or telling?

37:09.456 --> 37:13.358
It's Phil. I'm Phil. I'm... it's Phil.

37:13.360 --> 37:14.394
You sure?

37:14.396 --> 37:15.563
Yep.

37:16.831 --> 37:18.463
Alright, Phil.

37:18.465 --> 37:20.633
Relax, man. I'm messing you. I'm Greg.

37:20.635 --> 37:21.769
Okay.

37:22.804 --> 37:24.336
Oh, should we...?

37:24.338 --> 37:26.405
Yeah.
-I thought... -Okay.

37:26.407 --> 37:27.807
Why are you holding my arm?

37:27.809 --> 37:30.409
I felt the moment... It's totally wrong.

37:30.411 --> 37:31.644
Impulse was... Yep.

37:31.646 --> 37:33.381
I don't know why I did that?

37:33.748 --> 37:36.317
Call CQ. Call CQ.

37:36.418 --> 37:40.485
This is Pam Cushing NOAA Space
Weather Director, 20 megahertz.

37:40.487 --> 37:43.657
Looking for a fixed station
or digipeater to respond. Copy?

37:45.092 --> 37:51.664
Call CQ. Call CQ. This is Pam Cushing NOAA
Space Weather Director, 20.01 megahertz.

37:51.666 --> 37:56.304
Looking for a fixed station
or digipeater to respond. Copy?

38:19.094 --> 38:22.461
Grab spars, hooks, and poles! I need
people on every side of this boat.

38:22.463 --> 38:25.030
We're over buildings and houses.
We're miles in from the coast.

38:25.032 --> 38:30.936
If we founder on a roof or hit a
building, or something, we're sunk.

38:30.938 --> 38:32.604
I'm just saying.
-What can I do?

38:32.606 --> 38:35.474
I need people with poles
on the bow and the aft.

38:35.476 --> 38:39.112
If they see anything, anything,
push the boat way from it.

38:39.114 --> 38:41.546
- This is vital.
- Okay. Got it.

38:41.548 --> 38:44.016
You had oars in your raft, didn't you?

38:44.018 --> 38:45.751
Yeah. For paddling.

38:45.753 --> 38:47.987
We could lash those together, maybe?

38:47.989 --> 38:50.822
Great! Phil and Greg make
sure the oars are long enough.

38:50.824 --> 38:51.958
Alright? Go!
-Come on.

38:51.960 --> 38:55.530
Earl. Rob. Each of you
take a pole and get topside.

38:56.563 --> 39:00.534
I'll use the oars... Duct
tape.

39:01.001 --> 39:04.070
Just hold them.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Okay. Okay. Nice.

39:04.072 --> 39:08.843
Keep your eyes peeled and steer clear of
any obstacles, got it? -Got it. -Great. Go!

39:12.514 --> 39:14.981
Duct tape.

39:20.088 --> 39:21.387
Got one!

39:21.389 --> 39:25.058
We're going over a communications
building. Look alive, guys!

39:33.869 --> 39:37.838
It's about a mile and a half of the
starboard bow. I think they're in trouble.

39:45.012 --> 39:46.313
Coming up! Tail end!

39:46.315 --> 39:49.050
- Here. You got this?
- Yeah. I got it. Go ahead. -Okay.

39:52.219 --> 39:53.487
Wow.

40:11.572 --> 40:14.641
- You okay, man?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm good.

40:16.478 --> 40:18.677
Hey man, look alive! This is serious!

40:18.679 --> 40:21.179
Alright! Man, I got
this, alright? Calm down!

40:21.181 --> 40:22.416
Damn.

40:28.889 --> 40:30.490
Oh, man.

40:31.559 --> 40:32.992
I got to get out there.

40:32.994 --> 40:34.594
I don't think that's a good idea.

40:34.596 --> 40:36.028
Of course it's not a good idea.

40:36.030 --> 40:38.731
I don't want you anywhere near that
building when those levees break.

40:38.733 --> 40:40.868
That's why I have to
keep them from breaking.

41:07.027 --> 41:08.661
Who's in charge here?

41:08.663 --> 41:10.329
- We're not accepting anymore
civilians. - No, no. I'm Pam Cushing,

41:10.331 --> 41:13.798
Director of Space Weather for the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.834
I need to know who's in
charge of this facility?

41:15.836 --> 41:18.304
I think Bill's down in the cafeteria,
right? We've been cutoff, Ma'am,

41:18.306 --> 41:21.907
without communications or
a civilian administrator.

41:21.909 --> 41:26.077
The power's been spotty, and Staff Sgt.
Wilkerson has been kind of running things.

41:26.079 --> 41:27.780
Okay. Thank you, soldier.

41:27.782 --> 41:30.849
Please tell your staff sergeant to make it
to the main entrance with as many soldiers...

41:30.851 --> 41:33.719
Soldiers? It's just me, him, and the
refugees. -Okay. Fine. As many able-bodied

41:33.721 --> 41:36.657
recruits as he can lay his
hands on in four minutes.

41:37.692 --> 41:39.325
Now!

41:39.327 --> 41:42.827
Bill, this is Ricky. You'd better get
down here. Right now and bring everybody.

41:42.829 --> 41:46.331
I mean it. Someone's
here, and she's pissed.

41:46.333 --> 41:50.068
I need three or four of you guys on the
double. You're going to save the world.

41:50.070 --> 41:53.007
Bring your stuff with you. We have
to keep this place from flooding.

41:55.108 --> 41:57.909
You're going to need all hands on
deck. If these computers get waterlogged

41:57.911 --> 42:00.747
they're not even going
to be able to run basic.

42:00.882 --> 42:02.081
What are you gonna do?

42:02.083 --> 42:03.615
I have enough diesel over
there to get us over to France.

42:03.617 --> 42:06.952
But I'm going to have to hitch a ride
over to CERN from there. -Gentlemen,

42:06.954 --> 42:11.023
this facility will not flood. It can't. The
future of all life on Earth depends on it.

42:11.025 --> 42:12.626
Do you understand me?

42:13.827 --> 42:16.697
We need three or four men to
keep the collider from flooding.

42:21.869 --> 42:25.139
I'll go, too.

42:28.141 --> 42:31.611
Uh-uh. Ain't no way I'm going out there.

42:32.012 --> 42:34.813
Look man, nothing personal.
But that's suicide.

42:34.815 --> 42:38.083
We're talking about building a
wall to keep out the Atlantic Ocean.

42:38.085 --> 42:39.885
And I don't want no part of that.

42:39.887 --> 42:42.354
What did he say? He needed
what, 3 or 4 of y'all, right?

42:42.356 --> 42:47.959
- So I see one, two, three. So...
- -four and a half. <i>Vamos mijo.</i>

42:47.961 --> 42:49.929
Are you sure that's a good idea?

42:49.931 --> 42:53.264
Getting off the boat is a good
idea before I lose my mind.

42:53.266 --> 42:55.735
So, yes. <i>Vamos</i> .

43:05.847 --> 43:06.880
Alright.

43:06.882 --> 43:09.215
I got it. Alright. At
least I think I got it.

43:10.751 --> 43:13.853
The underwater cable will provide a grounded
line for us to talk once we get to CERN.

43:13.855 --> 43:16.088
- Okay.
- Are you gonna make it there in that?

43:16.090 --> 43:19.025
Yeah. I mean, the ark's
got at least 37 days, right?

43:20.329 --> 43:23.061
Ms. Cushing, Staff Sgt. Wilkerson
will be here in a minute.

43:23.063 --> 43:24.764
Alright. Thank you.

43:24.766 --> 43:26.365
We have to divide up into teams.

43:26.367 --> 43:27.999
We got recruits coming from the boat.

43:28.001 --> 43:31.737
I want a team commandeering supplies for
more sandbags, as well as scaffolding.

43:31.739 --> 43:35.041
This wall has to be reinforced
to a height of at least 60 feet.

43:35.043 --> 43:36.175
Would that do it?

43:36.177 --> 43:39.045
Uh, yeah. Sixty feet should
get you over the melt line,

43:39.047 --> 43:41.046
provided there's no tectonic
disturbance near here.

43:41.048 --> 43:44.182
Brookhaven's not on the Ramapo fault.
At least it didn't used to be...

43:44.184 --> 43:46.753
But I don't want to
leave you. Not like this.

43:47.954 --> 43:49.222
If this works,

43:51.224 --> 43:52.825
I'll ask you out again.

43:55.295 --> 43:58.198
Since we don't work together anymore.

44:19.853 --> 44:21.888
Take care of her for me. Please.

44:51.318 --> 44:52.517
Come on, fellas.

44:52.519 --> 44:55.755
No time like the present to
do something with your life.

45:15.842 --> 45:18.878
We're going to need scaffolds
on every one of these.

45:19.347 --> 45:22.850
Hey! Make sure they're strong
enough to keep the building up.

45:33.126 --> 45:35.994
The ion cannons here have been
designed to run in parallel.

45:35.996 --> 45:38.031
And that's perfect for what we need, but...

45:38.331 --> 45:42.400
Normally, you'd just take two particles
running in opposite directions and

45:42.402 --> 45:46.439
crash them into each other at a
pre-determined point and time in space.

45:46.541 --> 45:50.441
We need to recalibrate the cannons to
fire multiple bursts of particles at

45:50.443 --> 45:53.211
ever-accelerating rates. Each
particle faster than the last.

45:53.213 --> 45:57.150
So instead of merely colliding two
particles into each other at once,

45:57.818 --> 46:01.154
we collide thousands. Millions.

46:01.422 --> 46:04.222
So, to overcome the second
law of thermodynamics...

46:04.224 --> 46:07.592
We'd create an enduring singularity?
-Yes.

46:07.594 --> 46:11.197
And then we kill the
power to it. Can we do it?

46:12.132 --> 46:13.500
Come on.

46:21.474 --> 46:23.043
Whoa.

46:24.445 --> 46:27.314
That kid has a future in quantum
physics if he keeps up at this rate.

46:27.447 --> 46:30.317
Yeah. If we live.

46:32.353 --> 46:33.586
Hey.

46:33.588 --> 46:35.189
You can't give up hope.

46:35.989 --> 46:42.862
I don't know if it's God or karma or physical
probabilities that result in miracles.

46:43.563 --> 46:45.530
I don't know if I believe in God or karma,

46:45.532 --> 46:48.101
I do believe in miracles.

46:50.103 --> 46:52.138
Let me tell you about your miracles.

46:52.974 --> 46:59.077
My sons and I were with my husband
on our way to the grocery store,

46:59.079 --> 47:02.415
when the tsunami hit miles away.

47:03.083 --> 47:10.356
We were going to shop, that's why
I didn't pack no water wings...

47:11.259 --> 47:12.224
nothing.

47:12.226 --> 47:14.961
I didn't pack nothing.

47:16.264 --> 47:21.200
This one can tread water for
days, but you know, he's clingy.

47:21.202 --> 47:28.409
He was holding me so tight, when I came up
to the surface, I couldn't see my husband.

47:29.143 --> 47:32.644
I couldn't see
Pablito. I couldn't see my baby.

47:32.646 --> 47:33.646
I'm so sorry.

47:33.648 --> 47:36.016
Don't touch me.

47:37.318 --> 47:39.418
He wanted to hold on to you.
He didn't know what to do.

47:39.420 --> 47:43.289
I didn't know what
to do. They still don't know!

47:43.925 --> 47:47.494
But I know that I can't
keep living like this.

48:04.644 --> 48:09.282
Wow. That's amazing,
Ron. How did you do that?

48:23.164 --> 48:24.465
What's up, Josh?

48:25.298 --> 48:32.137
Hey remind me. It's bow,
aft, port, starboard?

48:32.139 --> 48:34.508
- You got it. You got it.
- Right on.

48:35.076 --> 48:37.309
What's... what's this thing here?

48:37.311 --> 48:40.278
This is a MINS navigation system.

48:40.280 --> 48:43.548
Helps us get from Point A to Point B.

48:43.550 --> 48:44.416
Awesome.

48:44.418 --> 48:48.320
Does it beep? Does it... How do you know?

48:48.322 --> 48:51.190
What the... -It's a combination
of gyroscopes and accelerometers

48:51.192 --> 48:55.327
that enables the inertial nav system
track our exact location on the planet.

48:55.329 --> 49:01.268
Irrespective of GPS signals or
the earth's magnetic field. Yeah.

49:01.568 --> 49:04.271
You just pick your next destination.

49:06.239 --> 49:11.311
Then this baby keeps you honest in between.
That's why I upgraded the radar array.

49:11.478 --> 49:13.278
That is amazing.

49:13.280 --> 49:16.148
Yeah. It wasn't cheap either.

49:16.150 --> 49:18.450
That's why they don't come
standard on boats and planes.

49:18.452 --> 49:23.057
Can we make it that far without refueling?

49:24.625 --> 49:29.463
If we can keep the wind to our backs we
should have just enough diesel to get there.

49:31.197 --> 49:32.665
Just.

49:41.742 --> 49:43.307
Stand clear.

49:47.047 --> 49:48.514
Ladies and gentlemen,

49:48.516 --> 49:50.615
I give you OVER 60 feet of sea wall.

50:10.204 --> 50:12.573
The utility pole! Stand clear!

50:13.106 --> 50:15.009
Run!

50:36.429 --> 50:38.463
We're... we're okay.

50:38.465 --> 50:39.665
We're okay.

50:49.742 --> 50:52.344
Marjorie!

51:05.391 --> 51:08.227
Everybody, get on dry ground, now!

51:11.364 --> 51:12.398
Cut the power!

51:12.400 --> 51:15.367
Told you not to mess
with another man's power.

51:15.369 --> 51:17.202
Cut the power now!

51:17.204 --> 51:19.871
We got three down and
seven of us are trapped.

51:32.887 --> 51:35.255
Stay here. Okay, buddy?
-Okay.

51:39.193 --> 51:39.858
Oh no!

51:39.860 --> 51:41.628
Marjorie?

51:42.228 --> 51:43.427
Alright.

51:43.429 --> 51:44.630
What happened?

51:44.797 --> 51:47.467
Utility pole for the facility came down.

51:47.635 --> 51:49.536
Conducted the current perfectly.

51:50.436 --> 51:51.702
Majorie.

51:51.704 --> 51:53.473
Majorie!
-Easy!

51:53.606 --> 51:57.344
No, no, no, no!
-Hey buddy. Take it easy. It's alright.

51:57.744 --> 51:58.943
You're okay.

51:58.945 --> 51:59.878
- You're okay.
- You alright?

51:59.880 --> 52:02.380
You guys should go to the control room.

52:02.382 --> 52:06.418
Ron's in there. Just don't tell him what
happened. I'll tell him when I get back.

52:06.420 --> 52:08.487
Hold on. Where are you going?

52:08.489 --> 52:09.887
Our power is out.

52:09.889 --> 52:12.291
I know. We turned it off
when the lines went down.

52:12.293 --> 52:15.596
Evidently, most of the connections
were fried from the sea water.

52:15.697 --> 52:16.829
That was our last straw.

52:16.831 --> 52:19.764
There's a coal and gas
burning station at Hempstead.

52:19.766 --> 52:22.467
One of their main substations is near
by. I'm going to try to power it directly

52:22.469 --> 52:24.570
to the substations so we
don't go down there again.

52:24.572 --> 52:27.374
You're going to hard-wire
into the collider?

52:27.474 --> 52:29.143
Yeah.

52:31.211 --> 52:32.445
Listen,

52:32.579 --> 52:35.546
I was an electrician in the navy, okay?

52:35.548 --> 52:39.483
It's been a long time, but just
let me do it. Instead of you.

52:39.485 --> 52:40.885
Are you sure you want to risk it?

52:40.887 --> 52:43.556
You have a little boy to look after now.

52:44.692 --> 52:48.594
Besides, I promised Joshua
I'd make sure you'd stay safe.

53:03.010 --> 53:04.778
What's going on here?

53:31.938 --> 53:34.207
This isn't right.

53:44.550 --> 53:45.985
We're slowing down.

53:54.994 --> 53:56.695
It's dark in here.

53:56.697 --> 53:58.832
Uh, Joshua... What's happening?

54:03.336 --> 54:04.302
We're taking on water.

54:04.304 --> 54:06.438
What are we gonna do? We're sinking!

54:06.440 --> 54:09.909
We're not sinking. We're taking on water.

54:11.077 --> 54:12.845
That's what sinking is!

54:12.847 --> 54:17.985
We've already taken in too much water.
The electrical is down and so is the bilge.

54:19.652 --> 54:21.320
Phil,

54:21.322 --> 54:24.891
- I'm going to need you to oversee getting
the water out of here. - Uh-huh. Okay.

54:24.992 --> 54:27.794
Greg, I'm going to
need you to give Phil a hand.

54:28.528 --> 54:30.364
I'm going to try to patch it on this side.

54:30.998 --> 54:33.898
Greg, I'll go down, I'll
start pumping first. Greg... Whoa!

54:33.900 --> 54:37.670
You gotta just make sure you get
in and out again, okay? -Okay.

54:43.577 --> 54:46.446
Okay.

54:47.780 --> 54:49.715
I think right up there would be good.

54:50.416 --> 54:52.952
Alright. I'm gonna get
pumping on this side.

54:53.353 --> 54:55.019
Pump it! Pump it!

55:05.699 --> 55:07.567
Are you okay?

55:15.576 --> 55:18.545
It's not fair. You're
taking all the pieces.

55:19.947 --> 55:21.615
Hey.

55:22.382 --> 55:24.684
I'll see you later, little man.

55:26.987 --> 55:28.787
I didn't tell him anything.

55:28.789 --> 55:31.024
Thanks.

55:44.471 --> 55:46.438
Do you know what that shape is called?

55:46.440 --> 55:47.639
A spiral?

55:47.641 --> 55:54.114
Yeah. When I was little I
liked building things a lot too.

55:55.615 --> 55:57.784
I thought I was going to be an engineer.

55:59.619 --> 56:04.958
Then my daddy bought me a telescope
and he took me to go look at the stars.

56:08.695 --> 56:11.131
Do you like looking at the stars?

56:18.005 --> 56:19.905
Hey, Ron?

56:24.077 --> 56:31.585
Your mommy was in an accident.

56:34.855 --> 56:37.891
She's not going to be okay.

56:40.460 --> 56:42.628
Do you understand?

56:45.065 --> 56:47.865
She loved you so much, Ron.

56:47.867 --> 56:50.603
- And she wanted you to be so happy.

56:51.871 --> 56:57.176
I know this hurts now, but
you're going to make her so proud

56:57.510 --> 57:00.447
with all the wonderful things
you will do in your life.

57:02.081 --> 57:04.749
Because no matter where she
is and no matter where you are,

57:04.751 --> 57:07.554
she's going to always be
right here in your heart.

57:08.554 --> 57:10.556
- Okay?

57:19.900 --> 57:22.068
You're crushing me.

57:23.135 --> 57:25.771
I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

57:27.240 --> 57:29.608
- I'm sorry.

57:46.293 --> 57:48.461
That should fix the leak.

57:51.898 --> 57:53.231
Mel!

57:53.233 --> 57:54.798
Mel! You okay?

57:54.800 --> 57:57.135
- Whoa!
- Looks drier outside.

57:57.137 --> 58:00.804
Look guys, I can try to fix the bilge,
but we've already taken on so much water...

58:00.806 --> 58:02.173
we've gotta try to lighten our load.

58:02.175 --> 58:05.043
If we don't get rid of some of
this stuff... We've got to try to

58:05.045 --> 58:07.311
clear seven hundred pounds.
We're not going to make it.

58:07.313 --> 58:08.848
Computer equipment.

58:10.182 --> 58:13.150
- Personal items.
- There's got to be another way!

58:13.152 --> 58:15.619
You want us to throw the food overboard?
-No, no, no! Look,

58:15.621 --> 58:20.191
we've already made it 3,500 miles. We
should be able to get there within a day.

58:20.193 --> 58:22.726
If you even know where we're going.
-This isn't up for vote.

58:22.728 --> 58:25.264
If you want to live,
start dumping. Come on!

58:26.300 --> 58:28.001
We gotta go. Move!

58:29.902 --> 58:32.505
Nobody's touching the food.

58:32.706 --> 58:35.041
- Too late.
- Dude, you don't want to do that.

58:35.809 --> 58:37.075
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Shut up, man!

58:37.077 --> 58:40.945
Shut up! I'm not doing anything,
okay? Nobody touches the food.

58:40.947 --> 58:47.351
Okay. Okay. Look. It's
my boat. It's my food.

58:53.059 --> 58:54.992
Okay! Okay!

58:54.994 --> 58:56.094
You keep...

58:57.297 --> 59:00.097
Okay. Okay. You keep
the food. You make the call.

59:00.099 --> 59:04.235
- Asshole! He saved you, and you shoot him?
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

59:04.237 --> 59:07.838
Okay! Okay!
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! -Greg... Greg...

59:07.840 --> 59:09.206
Greg's in charge. Do what he says.

59:09.208 --> 59:11.275
That's crazy! You can't put him in charge!

59:11.277 --> 59:15.347
He put himself in charge. I just
want to listen to what he says.

59:15.349 --> 59:16.481
What do you want to do?

59:16.483 --> 59:18.682
- We're not throwing out the food!
- Okay.

59:18.684 --> 59:22.753
I get that. But how do
you want to save the boat?

59:22.755 --> 59:24.223
Alright.

59:24.858 --> 59:27.258
Just... Like what you said.

59:27.260 --> 59:28.525
Do what you said.

59:28.527 --> 59:32.697
Alright. Throwing stuff
overboard. Just not the food.

59:32.699 --> 59:34.999
Okay. Okay.

59:35.001 --> 59:39.104
If it isn't... If it isn't
bolted down, pitch it overboard.

59:39.106 --> 59:43.941
Take my computer. Take my journals.
Everything in this cabin goes.

59:43.943 --> 59:46.244
Okay, this never
happened on playground duty.

59:46.246 --> 59:49.883
We gotta apply pressure
or you'll bleed to death.

59:53.820 --> 59:55.288
Aah!

59:57.391 --> 01:00:00.691
Everything in this cabin goes! Aah!

01:00:00.693 --> 01:00:02.195
Except the food!

01:00:02.996 --> 01:00:04.662
Come on, guys. Let's go.

01:00:04.664 --> 01:00:07.197
Come on guys! Nick, no! Come on!

01:00:07.199 --> 01:00:08.400
Look, don't wait for me.

01:00:08.402 --> 01:00:10.036
Go!

01:00:10.737 --> 01:00:12.238
What's next?

01:00:13.373 --> 01:00:16.106
What about fuel, right?

01:00:16.108 --> 01:00:19.376
We can dump that off.
-We barely have enough to make there as is.

01:00:19.378 --> 01:00:21.313
We're carrying too much weight.

01:00:22.782 --> 01:00:24.349
Aah!

01:00:24.351 --> 01:00:27.885
Here's Pam's things. You
might want that. Excuse me...

01:00:31.123 --> 01:00:34.293
Come on. We gotta do something
else. This isn't working.

01:00:35.195 --> 01:00:36.327
MEL!

01:00:36.329 --> 01:00:39.264
Come out of the bathroom, man!
-Hey! Hey, everybody!

01:00:39.266 --> 01:00:42.066
Listen. Listen, okay? Listen.

01:00:42.068 --> 01:00:44.202
We can get through this. But
we've got to work together.

01:00:44.204 --> 01:00:46.371
We need all hands on deck.

01:00:46.373 --> 01:00:48.942
And I've got only one good arm left.

01:00:53.346 --> 01:01:00.320
What if we just... We keep enough
food to make it to dry land.

01:01:03.956 --> 01:01:06.125
You're in charge.

01:01:11.731 --> 01:01:15.800
Greg and I are gonna
supervise dumping the food.

01:01:15.802 --> 01:01:18.802
Phil, Nick, you two are gonna
have to keep dumping water out of here.

01:01:18.804 --> 01:01:24.508
Molly, you get whatever's
not bolted down overboard.

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:26.478
Mel?

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:29.748
You just keep doing
whatever it is your doing.

01:01:33.186 --> 01:01:37.891
I'm sorry about, you know.
-Yeah.

01:02:02.849 --> 01:02:05.182
- Hey. You got it?
- Alright. It's ready on my end.

01:02:05.184 --> 01:02:08.286
But explain to me how I can hook this up
without shorting every circuit in the collider.

01:02:08.288 --> 01:02:13.291
We ran less than five miles of Kiwi
ASCR, hard-patched at the substation.

01:02:13.293 --> 01:02:17.095
That's over 160 megawatts with
less than one OHM of resistance

01:02:17.097 --> 01:02:18.530
coursing through this line right there.

01:02:18.532 --> 01:02:21.065
You've got your juice.

01:02:21.067 --> 01:02:23.066
Just don't ask me about eminent
domain for all the stringing we

01:02:23.068 --> 01:02:26.037
had to do with the flooded
backyard, cause I ain't a lawyer.

01:02:26.039 --> 01:02:29.307
A lawsuit never sounded so good.
- Yeah.

01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:30.477
Hey.

01:02:31.143 --> 01:02:33.178
How's the kid?

01:02:40.586 --> 01:02:42.021
Hey!

01:02:42.922 --> 01:02:44.523
Hey! It's okay.

01:02:45.125 --> 01:02:47.260
Do you want to play with this?

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.862
I probably only have stinky
games on there, but...

01:02:50.429 --> 01:02:51.931
Look.

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:59.269
I don't know what you're
feeling or... I'm useless.

01:02:59.271 --> 01:03:03.976
Maybe if you tell me what's
bothering you, I can try to help.

01:03:05.244 --> 01:03:07.447
Nobody wants me.

01:03:08.248 --> 01:03:09.981
Nobody ever will.

01:03:09.983 --> 01:03:11.351
No.

01:03:12.052 --> 01:03:14.854
No, no, no. That's not true.

01:03:14.954 --> 01:03:16.588
Ron?

01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:18.490
Hey.

01:03:22.027 --> 01:03:24.429
Do you want to come live with me?

01:03:27.467 --> 01:03:30.568
I'd love it if you came to live with me.

01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:32.472
Please?

01:03:35.141 --> 01:03:36.474
Okay?
-Okay.

01:03:36.476 --> 01:03:38.278
Okay.

01:03:39.311 --> 01:03:41.079
It's a deal.

01:03:42.047 --> 01:03:43.282
Deal.

01:04:07.507 --> 01:04:09.039
Hey! Hey! There's land!

01:04:09.041 --> 01:04:11.610
Hey! Hey, everybody. There's land!

01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:25.958
Sorry.

01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:31.497
Where are we?

01:04:33.432 --> 01:04:34.900
France?

01:04:35.402 --> 01:04:37.068
The base of the Alps.

01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:40.637
Without MINS navigation or a
working compass or altimeter,

01:04:40.639 --> 01:04:43.242
that's all I can say for certain.

01:04:50.483 --> 01:04:51.416
I got this, professor.

01:04:51.418 --> 01:04:54.184
That, and that we're running out of time.

01:04:54.186 --> 01:04:55.654
Come on.

01:05:15.708 --> 01:05:17.675
Looks like an old hotel.

01:05:17.677 --> 01:05:19.579
Abandoned.

01:05:21.114 --> 01:05:23.349
Where do you think Greg went?

01:05:24.416 --> 01:05:25.583
Beats me.

01:05:30.322 --> 01:05:33.326
We're in a place called La Ravoire.

01:05:45.505 --> 01:05:48.474
I'll drive us once I
get this thing started.

01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:54.513
As long as you guys don't
mind a little broken glass.

01:06:01.454 --> 01:06:03.556
What's the plan, professor?

01:06:04.757 --> 01:06:08.126
Get into CERN. No matter what.

01:06:08.327 --> 01:06:10.228
No matter what?

01:06:11.998 --> 01:06:17.334
Last time I spoke to CERN's deputy director,
Dr. Zicree and I didn't exactly hit it off.

01:06:17.336 --> 01:06:20.206
What? You guys throw-down or something?

01:06:21.141 --> 01:06:22.474
Or something.

01:06:24.143 --> 01:06:27.412
Well, let's hope that the
man has a sense of humor.

01:06:27.414 --> 01:06:29.449
Or amnesia.

01:06:35.621 --> 01:06:38.623
How high is 480 meters?

01:06:38.625 --> 01:06:40.726
That's over 1,600 hundred feet.

01:06:41.393 --> 01:06:43.827
You should be safe and dry for now.

01:06:43.829 --> 01:06:46.132
The ground is sinking.

01:06:46.398 --> 01:06:51.136
When the poles flooded, the
sea level rose by 260 feet.

01:06:52.838 --> 01:06:56.574
But that fact that, 800 feet
of France is underwater means

01:06:56.576 --> 01:07:01.713
that the Helvetic zone or the Gurasian
Plate is sinking into the mediterranean.

01:07:02.215 --> 01:07:03.847
Who knows when it's going to stop.

01:07:03.849 --> 01:07:05.784
Or if.

01:07:07.152 --> 01:07:09.688
We've got to get to CERN.

01:07:31.411 --> 01:07:34.414
I don't speak French.
Does anybody speak French?

01:07:47.126 --> 01:07:48.427
Nice.

01:07:49.797 --> 01:07:53.532
I told them that I don't speak
French and that I'm hard of hearing.

01:08:01.373 --> 01:08:02.472
Excuse me.

01:08:02.474 --> 01:08:04.710
I'm Doctor Joshua Chamberlain.

01:08:05.545 --> 01:08:07.577
- No no. I'm formerly with the United States

01:08:07.579 --> 01:08:10.348
Geological Survey I'm here
to see Dr. Marc Zicree.

01:08:12.152 --> 01:08:14.552
The Deputy Director of
CERN, Dr. Marc Zicree.

01:08:14.554 --> 01:08:16.086
Please. It's urgent.
-You have to leave now.

01:08:16.087 --> 01:08:23.194
We're not going anywhere until we
speak to Deputy Director Zicree. Please.

01:08:25.596 --> 01:08:27.867
Doctor Zicree!

01:08:28.835 --> 01:08:30.401
They're not playing, professor.

01:08:30.403 --> 01:08:35.740
I'm not going anywhere until I see the
Deputy Director Marc Zicree! Please!

01:08:35.742 --> 01:08:36.841
Aah!

01:08:44.649 --> 01:08:45.916
Easy, Frenchy.

01:08:45.917 --> 01:08:47.353
Easy.

01:08:57.395 --> 01:09:00.830
- Dr. Chamberlain.
- Dr. Zicree, is that you?

01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:02.732
I'm so sorry.

01:09:11.778 --> 01:09:14.779
Serves me right for not
learning a second language.

01:09:16.814 --> 01:09:21.751
Dr. Zicree how did you...? -I was in
communications with your... with Dr. Cushing.

01:09:21.752 --> 01:09:26.457
When I saw you on the security
screens, thought I should intervene.

01:09:27.426 --> 01:09:29.295
Just in the nick of time.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.361
Do you need medical attention?

01:09:31.363 --> 01:09:33.397
No.
-Are you alright?

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:34.598
Never been better.

01:09:37.804 --> 01:09:40.805
What do you want him to do with your truck?

01:09:42.442 --> 01:09:43.876
Park it.

01:09:51.884 --> 01:09:56.320
Pamela forwarded your settings for increasing
the power of your particle collisions.

01:09:56.322 --> 01:10:00.625
Frankly, it's genius, and our
theoretical models are predicting at 2,000

01:10:00.627 --> 01:10:04.562
to 2 million fold increase in the
potentiation of both colliders.

01:10:04.564 --> 01:10:09.767
But so far in tests
we've been unsuccessful.

01:10:09.769 --> 01:10:12.035
Have you been assuming
a linear collision model?

01:10:12.037 --> 01:10:15.673
You'll have to use the Fokker...
-Planck equation of course.

01:10:15.675 --> 01:10:18.509
We're talking about Planck
energy level collisions that could

01:10:18.511 --> 01:10:22.946
actually reveal super string
theory at the sub-quark level.

01:10:22.948 --> 01:10:23.882
Of course.

01:10:23.884 --> 01:10:26.551
They definitely don't teach that at CSU.

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:34.393
Dr. Chamberlain, I was cavalier and
dismissive when you presented your concerns.

01:10:34.594 --> 01:10:37.695
I can't apologize to those who've
lost their lives as a result,

01:10:37.697 --> 01:10:40.865
but I can tell you how sorry I am.

01:10:42.635 --> 01:10:44.737
Thank you, doctor.

01:10:58.384 --> 01:10:59.884
Where they explode into each other.

01:10:59.886 --> 01:11:03.589
Dr. Cushing. Permission
from Dr. Chamberlain.

01:11:04.823 --> 01:11:07.726
I wasn't sure if I was
ever going to see you again.

01:11:09.028 --> 01:11:10.861
What happened? Are you okay?

01:11:10.863 --> 01:11:12.664
You still believe in miracles?

01:11:13.765 --> 01:11:16.801
For once in a blue moon
that makes me the genius.

01:11:17.369 --> 01:11:18.902
We lost somebody here,

01:11:18.904 --> 01:11:22.742
but I did find one really special guy.

01:11:23.443 --> 01:11:25.711
Hey Ron, could you say 'Hi' to Josh?

01:11:27.479 --> 01:11:29.948
Hey, why don't you go over by Tom, okay?

01:11:32.652 --> 01:11:35.518
We've secured to a hardwired
160 megawatt power source.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:39.389
Despite that, we got some difficulty on
this end getting the RHIC in working order.

01:11:39.391 --> 01:11:42.793
It's the non-linear collision
operator you need to be assuming.

01:11:42.795 --> 01:11:44.961
That's it.

01:11:44.963 --> 01:11:52.037
You. And then we'll kill the ion
cannons to neutralize the singularities.

01:11:53.372 --> 01:11:56.007
It seems almost impossible, doesn't it?

01:11:56.641 --> 01:11:58.844
It's all because of you.

01:11:59.645 --> 01:12:04.615
Pam, an entire lifetime wouldn't be enough
for me to tell you how much I love you.

01:12:04.617 --> 01:12:08.788
And if we hurry we all might
get one longer than that. Come.

01:12:11.791 --> 01:12:17.027
The magnetosphere at the equator
is measuring over one microtesla,

01:12:17.029 --> 01:12:19.532
and that reading is falling.

01:12:19.664 --> 01:12:23.467
The Solar Dynamics Observatory feed
hasn't been unreliable since the last CME,

01:12:23.469 --> 01:12:26.971
but the information they have
been sending us has been alarming.

01:12:28.073 --> 01:12:31.911
Another solar event could
decimate our atmosphere.

01:12:32.043 --> 01:12:35.814
Maybe now we should initiate the protocol?

01:12:37.516 --> 01:12:40.353
Dr. Cushing, are you ready?

01:12:41.119 --> 01:12:43.122
Ready, Dr. Chamberlain.

01:12:43.222 --> 01:12:45.990
Launch the initial proton emissions...

01:12:46.125 --> 01:12:47.460
Now!

01:13:13.985 --> 01:13:16.486
When all these numbers go
down to zero, all the distance

01:13:16.488 --> 01:13:19.223
between them is going to
collapse in one single point.

01:13:19.225 --> 01:13:21.527
It's going to be like a crash.

01:13:22.028 --> 01:13:24.727
Picture two matchbox cars
colliding into one another.

01:13:24.729 --> 01:13:29.567
Only instead of matchbox cars we're using super
accelerated protons and instead of just two

01:13:29.569 --> 01:13:32.602
we're using millions and millions
colliding over and over again.

01:13:32.604 --> 01:13:36.674
But, It's just going to keep
happening. You follow me?

01:13:36.775 --> 01:13:39.778
I always thought matchboxes were cool.

01:13:41.046 --> 01:13:42.646
Me too.

01:13:42.648 --> 01:13:43.983
Wow.

01:13:46.152 --> 01:13:49.188
Pam? Pam? Are you seeing this?

01:13:50.256 --> 01:13:52.725
It's a quark-gluon plasma?

01:13:52.859 --> 01:13:56.794
We're just witnessing gluons.

01:13:56.796 --> 01:13:58.898
Oh my...

01:14:00.198 --> 01:14:04.603
We're registering graviton
displacement.

01:14:05.238 --> 01:14:07.972
Statistically significant gravity.

01:14:07.974 --> 01:14:11.677
- Are you seeing this?
- Pam. You're already in a singularity.

01:14:22.121 --> 01:14:24.554
Okay. We've got one, too. What
about the graviton readings?

01:14:24.556 --> 01:14:29.058
They're increasing. This is astonishing.
The two phenomena are feeding

01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:33.696
each other like magnets. It's the
interplanetary gravitational field.

01:14:33.698 --> 01:14:35.701
I think we've done it.

01:14:43.042 --> 01:14:44.944
Look at the screen.

01:14:47.747 --> 01:14:49.580
The magnetic field.

01:14:49.582 --> 01:14:52.985
It's re-engaging.
-It's coming back.

01:14:56.922 --> 01:14:58.423
Okay, Pam.

01:14:58.425 --> 01:15:02.226
We've got to synchronize and shut
down and neutralize the singularities.

01:15:02.228 --> 01:15:03.361
Understood.

01:15:03.363 --> 01:15:06.296
Can we terminate the ion
cannons in parallel with CERN?

01:15:06.298 --> 01:15:07.966
I believe we can.

01:15:19.744 --> 01:15:22.146
The gravitational pull is
starting to strain our system.

01:15:22.148 --> 01:15:24.180
The electro-magnetic drain
containing our phenomenon

01:15:24.182 --> 01:15:27.217
has increased over 30 percent
in the last 15 seconds.

01:15:27.219 --> 01:15:29.053
50 percent and climbing!

01:15:29.055 --> 01:15:34.293
Okay, Pam. In three. Two. One.

01:15:34.627 --> 01:15:35.895
Kill the power.

01:15:35.996 --> 01:15:37.262
Kill the power.

01:15:38.130 --> 01:15:39.228
Whoa.

01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:42.001
I can't. We've overloaded the panel.

01:15:54.713 --> 01:15:56.649
Get everybody out of here.

01:15:57.382 --> 01:15:58.949
Tom, take Ron.

01:15:58.951 --> 01:16:01.619
The hardwire on the ion
cannon. It's fused on?

01:16:01.621 --> 01:16:05.123
- No!
- Run! Now!

01:16:05.957 --> 01:16:06.891
Pam?

01:16:06.893 --> 01:16:10.029
- Move it! Move it! Go!
- Pam?

01:16:12.431 --> 01:16:16.200
But we've already shut down our
electro-magnetic containment.

01:16:16.202 --> 01:16:19.572
No, no, no, no! Re-engage
the containment magnets.

01:16:25.043 --> 01:16:26.612
It's too late.

01:16:38.724 --> 01:16:40.125
Where is it going?

01:16:40.225 --> 01:16:42.027
Long Island.

01:16:43.863 --> 01:16:48.067
Only if it hits the outer core first and
fuses with the super-heated liquid iron there.

01:16:51.737 --> 01:16:53.706
The planet will be destroyed.

01:16:55.908 --> 01:16:57.741
The override!

01:16:57.743 --> 01:17:01.245
If we're lucky the two black
holes just consume themselves.

01:17:01.247 --> 01:17:03.914
If the black hole is still
within entropy bounds,

01:17:03.916 --> 01:17:06.316
It's theoretical. It could be possible.

01:17:06.318 --> 01:17:08.153
I have to know for sure.

01:17:09.889 --> 01:17:12.157
I know... I know what to do.

01:17:12.757 --> 01:17:16.794
No, no, no. Pam! Your containment field
is not strong enough to hold that singularity.

01:17:16.796 --> 01:17:21.330
Josh. I love you,
Dr. Chamberlain.

01:17:21.332 --> 01:17:22.934
Run! Now!

01:17:31.342 --> 01:17:33.244
PAM!

01:17:34.079 --> 01:17:35.314
Come on, Pam.

01:17:39.018 --> 01:17:41.185
What's the depth now?

01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:46.156
Eight hundred miles but the singularities
are increasing in mass, not decreasing.

01:17:46.158 --> 01:17:49.793
Okay. The mantle there is
roughly 1,800 mies thick.

01:17:49.795 --> 01:17:52.131
That's about how much
time we have to stop it.

01:17:54.233 --> 01:17:56.702
So, if she can't turn it off?

01:18:02.841 --> 01:18:05.743
Brookhaven's offline. Two minutes.

01:18:17.922 --> 01:18:19.724
1,600 miles.

01:18:22.427 --> 01:18:24.962
1,650 miles.

01:18:25.264 --> 01:18:26.229
Stand back.

01:18:26.231 --> 01:18:28.165
What the hell are you doing?

01:18:28.167 --> 01:18:29.933
I said stand back!

01:18:29.935 --> 01:18:31.770
1,700 miles.

01:18:36.141 --> 01:18:38.976
1,750 miles.

01:18:53.158 --> 01:18:54.759
Ms. Pam!

01:18:56.895 --> 01:18:58.463
It's... It's gone.

01:19:02.467 --> 01:19:03.933
It's gone.

01:19:03.935 --> 01:19:05.335
She did it.

01:19:05.337 --> 01:19:08.237
Dr. Chamberlain. Your wife saved us.

01:19:08.239 --> 01:19:11.107
You saved us!

01:19:11.109 --> 01:19:12.411
Yes!

01:19:18.850 --> 01:19:19.950
What about... what about, Pam?

01:19:19.952 --> 01:19:23.255
What about... What about Brookhaven?

01:19:25.890 --> 01:19:27.458
There is no signal.

01:19:27.827 --> 01:19:29.360
It's completely dead.

01:19:37.136 --> 01:19:42.472
Ladies and gentlemen, thanks
to your ingenuity and bravery,

01:19:42.474 --> 01:19:46.108
the magnetosphere is once
again protecting our planet.

01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:48.881
33 microteslas and holding.

01:19:49.582 --> 01:19:53.218
Our communications. Our atmosphere.

01:19:53.418 --> 01:19:57.855
Our very existence as a
species have all been restored.

01:19:58.356 --> 01:20:05.063
To Pamela Cushing and
Dr. Joshua Chamberlain.

01:20:17.609 --> 01:20:19.978
Thank you everyone.

01:20:23.649 --> 01:20:26.185
To our heroes.

01:20:27.653 --> 01:20:29.988
May God protect them.

01:21:01.587 --> 01:21:02.820
Pam?

01:21:02.822 --> 01:21:06.291
Pam, are you alright? Thank
God! I couldn't live without you.

01:21:07.192 --> 01:21:08.860
Pam?

01:21:08.993 --> 01:21:11.063
Pam, are you crying?

01:21:16.001 --> 01:21:19.538
Mr. Joshua... Ms. Pam, she's.

01:21:24.143 --> 01:21:25.476
No.

01:21:28.012 --> 01:21:31.649
We were supposed to
live together, but now...

01:21:36.454 --> 01:21:38.122
Hey, Ron?

01:21:39.091 --> 01:21:41.093
She's amazing, isn't she?

01:21:42.127 --> 01:21:43.929
She told you that.

01:21:46.198 --> 01:21:47.296
You know,

01:21:47.298 --> 01:21:50.101
I though she and I were
going to live together, too.

01:21:51.403 --> 01:21:56.574
So since we both thought
we'd be with her...

01:21:56.742 --> 01:21:58.342
Ms. Pam?

01:22:00.011 --> 01:22:01.212
Ms. Pam!

01:22:01.314 --> 01:22:02.745
What's happening?

01:22:02.747 --> 01:22:04.214
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy.

01:22:04.216 --> 01:22:05.617
Easy, easy, easy.

01:22:05.717 --> 01:22:09.354
Oh! It's a miracle you're still alive!

01:22:12.524 --> 01:22:14.491
Relax. Take it easy.

01:22:14.493 --> 01:22:16.361
Breathe.

01:22:18.564 --> 01:22:20.565
It's Mr. Joshua.

01:22:30.576 --> 01:22:32.608
Can you stand me now?

01:22:32.610 --> 01:22:35.646
Absolutely not!

01:22:36.381 --> 01:22:39.549
And if you ever walked out on
me I would never forgive you.

01:22:39.551 --> 01:22:42.654
Ever! You understand me?

01:22:45.323 --> 01:22:47.291
Can I come back home?

01:22:47.725 --> 01:22:49.627
Back to you?

01:22:50.628 --> 01:22:53.398
I'll think my options over.

01:22:55.734 --> 01:22:58.203
It's a deal, Dr. Cushing.

01:22:59.604 --> 01:23:01.639
You got it.
