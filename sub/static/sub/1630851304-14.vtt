Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON

00:03.034 --> 00:09.137
"BIG BROTHER" THE SECRET ROYAL
FLUSH ALLIANCE OF THE KINGS, THE

00:09.172 --> 00:13.758
QUEENS AND A SINGLE ACE WAS A
DOMINANT FORCE IN THE GAME.

00:13.793 --> 00:14.931
ROYAL FLUSH.

00:14.965 --> 00:18.586
BUT A SEAMINGLY EVEN MORE
POWERFUL GROUP WAS OPERATING

00:18.620 --> 00:20.068
COMPLETELY UNDETECTED.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.172
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT.

00:22.206 --> 00:23.551
THE COOKOUT.

00:23.586 --> 00:26.586
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES CAN
THERE BE ANY WHIFF OF AN IDEA

00:26.620 --> 00:29.517
THAT MEMBERS OF THE COOKOUT ARE
WORKING TOGETHER.

00:29.551 --> 00:32.241
Announcer: AND TIFFANY HAD
A MASTER PLAN TO GET THE COOKOUT

00:32.275 --> 00:38.241
TO THE END.

00:38.275 --> 00:40.310
YOU EACH BRING ON WITH US.

00:40.344 --> 00:44.241
WE NEED TO PARTNER WITH
SOMEONE ELSE OUTSIDE OF THE SO

00:44.275 --> 00:50.241
WE DON'T BR-NG ATTENTION TO
OURSELVE.

00:50.275 --> 01:02.034
Announcer: WITH WHITNEY

01:02.068 --> 01:05.551
AND HANNAH POSSIBLE TARGETS FOR
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD CHRISTIAN.

01:05.586 --> 01:08.275
I THINK WE HAVE TO PUT BOTH
OF THEM UP.

01:08.310 --> 01:11.413
THE COOKOUT WORKED TO PROTECT
ONE OF THEIR OWN.

01:11.448 --> 01:13.620
HANNAH IS WHO I HAVE CHOSEN.

01:13.655 --> 01:16.655
IF SOMEBODY ELSE HAS MORE OF
A THREAT TO BOTH OF OUR TEAMS

01:16.689 --> 01:19.965
AND THAT IS BRITINI.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.379
Announcer: WOULD SARAH
BETH PUSHED BACK ON.

01:22.413 --> 01:25.758
I THINK THE TARGET SHOULD BE
HANNAH.

01:25.793 --> 01:29.448
HANNAH IS OVERALL A MUCH BIGGER
THREAT TO MY GAME, SHE'S SMART,

01:29.482 --> 01:30.551
SHE'S ATHLETIC.

01:30.586 --> 01:32.517
SHE HAS ALL OF THESE GUYS
WRAPPED AROUND HER FINGER.

01:32.551 --> 01:37.310
PUTTING HER IN TIFFANY'S LINE
OF FIRE.

01:37.344 --> 01:41.793
SHE NEEDS TO BE OUT.

01:41.827 --> 01:46.482
Announcer: AT THE FINAL
WILDCARD COMPETITION, CLAIRE

01:46.517 --> 01:48.103
SECURED SAFETY UNTIL JURY.

01:48.137 --> 01:51.413
I'M GOING TO TAKE SAFETY FOR
JUST MYSELF.

01:51.448 --> 01:53.034
INDIVIDUAL SAFETY UNTIL JURY.

01:53.068 --> 01:57.620
I HAVE TO GO FOR THAT, OF
COURSE.

01:57.655 --> 02:01.275
Announcer: IT WAS HANNAH

ARTIST TAKE A POWDER, WITH THE

02:14.344 --> 02:15.275

02:15.310 --> 02:17.689

03:22.689 --> 03:24.827

PLANNED.

03:24.862 --> 03:28.448
WHITNEY WAS MY TARGET, SHE WENT
HOME, EVERYTHING WENT SMOOTHLY,

03:28.482 --> 03:29.689

03:29.724 --> 03:34.482
I'M GOING TO BE HERE FOR

SAFE AND THE H.O.H. PEDESTRIAN

03:37.931 --> 03:41.482
ROOM SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD ON TOP
OF THAT.

03:41.517 --> 03:43.344
LIKE A HAVE NOT ALL OVER
AGAIN.

03:43.379 --> 03:47.034
I DON'T REALLY NEED TO WIN
THIS H.O.H. BECAUSE I'M PRETTY

03:47.068 --> 03:49.793
MUCH GOOD WITH EVERYBODY IN THE
HOUSE.

03:49.827 --> 03:52.379
BUT I CAN'T MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
I'M NOT GOING FOR IT.

03:52.413 --> 03:54.586
WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE FOR
HOURS.

03:54.620 --> 03:58.000
THIS IS MY COMP, THE WALL
COMP IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING

03:58.034 --> 04:01.551
FOR, WITH MY WEIGHT, WITH MY
STRENGTH I FEEL LIKE I HAVE GOT

04:01.586 --> 04:05.034
THIS, CHRISTIAN IS MY RIGHT OF
GUY IN THIS HOUSE AND HE CAN NOT

04:05.068 --> 04:09.586
COMPETE, I HAVE TO WIN THIS
H.O.H. TO SECURE OUR SAFETY.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.586
I HATE HAVING A FAT ASS.

04:11.620 --> 04:17.586
I WANT TO WIN THE H.O.H. SO
BADLY.

04:17.620 --> 04:20.862

ME.

04:25.896 --> 04:30.034
I'M SORRY, BIG D, BUT YOU
HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

04:30.068 --> 04:32.034
BIG D.

04:32.068 --> 04:35.068
I'M OUT OF THIS FAME BUT I'M
HOPING THAT SOMEONE FROM THE

04:35.103 --> 04:41.517
COOKOUT ALLIANCE CAN WIN AND
THEN I CAN FILL BASES.

04:41.551 --> 04:43.068
HERE WE GO.

04:43.103 --> 04:44.068
IT'S GETTING COLDER.

04:44.103 --> 04:47.827
THE WORST PART OF THIS BY FAR
IS THE RAIN.

04:47.862 --> 04:51.758
I'M SHIVERING SO HARD BUT ALL I
KNOW IS I HAVE TO HANG ON IF I

04:51.793 --> 04:55.724
HAVE ANY CHANCE OF WINNING THE
COMP, FOR SOME REASON YOU WIN

04:55.758 --> 05:01.068
TWO AND YOU ARE A DMP COMP BEAST
AND THERE A TAR GE ON YOUR BACK,

05:01.103 --> 05:05.068
FOR MY SAFETY I WANT TO HOLD ON
TO THIS LONG AS LONG AS

05:05.103 --> 05:06.241
POSSIBLE.

05:06.275 --> 05:08.034
PIE GOAL RIGHT NOW IS STO
MAKE SURE THAT I GET THE SIX

05:08.068 --> 05:10.724
MEMBERS OF THE COOKOUT PLUS
THEIR PAWNS TO JURY.

05:10.758 --> 05:16.275
THE ONE PERSON WHO IS NOT
INCLUDED IN THIS GROUP OF 11 ASK

05:16.310 --> 05:20.310
ALYSSA SO IT IS SIMPLE THAT
ALYSSA CANNOT WIN THIS

05:20.344 --> 05:21.517
COMPETITION.

05:21.551 --> 05:23.758
I WILL HANG ON TO THIS WALL
UNTIL MY ARM FALLS OFF JUST TO

05:23.793 --> 05:26.379
MAKE SURE I DON'T FALL BEFORE
ALYSSA.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.655
I GOT SOME WINDSHIELD WIPERS.

05:28.689 --> 05:32.068
THIS COMPETITION IS NOT GOING
TO BE EASY.

05:32.103 --> 05:33.689
I DO TERRIBLE IN COLD.

05:33.724 --> 05:37.379
I'M REALLY WORRIED THAT I'M
GOING TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST

05:37.413 --> 05:39.241
PEOPLE TO DROP OUT OF THIS.

05:39.275 --> 05:42.586
OH, IT IT LOOKS LIKE SOME OF
THE PASSENGERS UPSTAIRS ARE

05:42.620 --> 05:48.724
GETTING SEA SICK.

05:48.758 --> 05:50.275

COME ON.

05:54.793 --> 05:58.034

05:58.068 --> 06:02.620
WHAT THE HELL WERE THE
PASSENGERS EATING, HIGHLIGHTERS?

06:02.655 --> 06:05.620
ITS VOMIT AND THE WATER, IT'S
A MESS.

06:05.655 --> 06:08.034
WE'RE GETTING SPRAYED FROM
EVERYWHERE.

06:08.068 --> 06:11.862
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING BECAUSE THE
WATER IS IN MY EYES.

06:11.896 --> 06:15.620
THE VOMIT IS IN MY EARS.

06:15.655 --> 06:26.655
LOOKING GOOD, HANNAH.

06:26.689 --> 06:30.310
THIS IS SO HARD, IT'S SO
COLD.

06:30.344 --> 06:32.000
I'M FIGHTING, I REALLY NEED
THIS.

06:32.034 --> 06:36.896
I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT I MAKE
IT-- OH WAIT, NO, ACTUALLY, I

06:36.931 --> 06:37.413
DON'T.

06:37.448 --> 06:38.862
I'M SAFE UNTIL JURY.

06:38.896 --> 06:45.137
I AM OUT OF HERE.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.344
GOOD JOB, CLAIRE.

06:46.379 --> 06:48.586
SORRY CLAIRE BUT YOU'VE BEEN
ELIMINATED.

06:48.620 --> 07:02.517
GOOD JOB, GUYS.

07:02.551 --> 07:06.137
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FLAT
AGAINST THE WALL, LIKE THEY ARE

07:06.172 --> 07:07.275
DOING UPRIGHT.

07:07.310 --> 07:08.862
COME ON SB.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.689
AT THIS POINT STAYING ON THE
WALL ANY LONGER WOULD JUST BE

07:11.724 --> 07:15.620
FOR MY OWN EGO AND RIGHT NOW I
THINK THE FORMER KINGS WILL

07:15.655 --> 07:17.586
PROTECT ME.

07:17.620 --> 07:19.034
I LET GO.

07:19.068 --> 07:27.620
OH MY GOSH, DONE.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.000
THAT'S OKAY.

07:29.034 --> 07:34.827
I AM SO FRUSTRATED WITH
MYSELF.

07:34.862 --> 07:40.206
I'M ROOTING FOR DEREK X OR
ANY MEMBER OF.

07:40.241 --> 07:43.896
COME ON GUYS.

OH GOD.

07:47.931 --> 07:48.758
HOLD IT.

07:48.793 --> 07:51.206
THIS COMPETITION IS CRAZY
DIFFICULT.

07:51.241 --> 07:55.103
THIS WALL WILL NOT STOP LEANING
FORWARD.

07:55.137 --> 07:58.586
THE VOMIT IS GETTING ON THE
HANDLES, DEFINITELY MAKING THEM

07:58.620 --> 08:02.310
SLIPPERY AND YOU'RE LEANING
ALMOST PARALLEL WITH THE FLOOR,

08:02.344 --> 08:08.896
IT'S NOT A GREAT SITUATION.

08:08.931 --> 08:10.965
YOU GOT IT KY.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.620
COME ON KY.

08:15.655 --> 08:17.655

WANTED TO WIN THIS, OR AT LEAST

08:20.793 --> 08:22.689
GO FURTHER THAN I DID.

08:22.724 --> 08:24.000

OWN HANDS, CONTROL MY OWN

08:42.000 --> 08:43.896
DESTINY AND TAKE THIS H.O.H.

08:43.931 --> 08:49.172

MENTAL GAME, GOT TO KEEP MY MIND

I JUST CANNOT, I CANNOT LET GO.

13:24.724 --> 13:27.206
YOU WILL NOT PUT ME UP IF I
DO.

13:27.241 --> 13:31.206
I PROMISE I WON'T.

13:31.241 --> 13:34.689
HANG ON.

13:34.724 --> 13:39.206
GAME FACE, GAME FACE, LYSS.

13:39.241 --> 13:40.517
FOCUS, FOCUS.

13:40.551 --> 13:48.034
SORRY, ALYSSA, YOU HAVE BEEN
ELIMINATED FROM THE COMPETITION.

13:48.068 --> 13:48.793
LYSS YOU DID AMAZING.

13:48.827 --> 13:52.931
DID YOU A GOOD JOB, LYSS.

13:52.965 --> 13:55.793
I JUST REALLY WANTED IT.

13:55.827 --> 13:56.965
THAT'S ALL.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.931
SO I FELT LIKE THIS WAS ONE THAT
WOULD BE PERFECT FOR ME.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.241
AND I BLEW IT.

14:03.275 --> 14:05.965
AND I WAS SO CLOSE.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.275
I JUST WISH DEREK WOULD HAVE
THROWN IT TO ME.

14:10.310 --> 14:12.103
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

14:12.137 --> 14:14.172
ALYSSA FALLS OFF THE WALL.

14:14.206 --> 14:17.034
I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING BUT JUMP
OUT OF MY BODY.

14:17.068 --> 14:18.551
I'M LIKE YES!

14:18.586 --> 14:19.827
THANK GOD.

14:19.862 --> 14:28.310
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO
GO PUSH THE GIRL OFF THE WALL

14:28.344 --> 14:29.206
MYSELF.

14:29.241 --> 14:31.034
HEY, COME ON, YOU ALREADY HAD
IT ONCE.

14:31.068 --> 14:33.034
YOU ALREADY IT HAD ONCE.

14:33.068 --> 14:35.862
DON'T BE GREEDY ABOUT IT.

14:35.896 --> 14:39.344
DEREK X HAS ALREADY WON TWO
VETOES BUT NOW HAVING H.O.H.

14:39.379 --> 14:44.103
ADDED TO HIS RESUME INCREASES
HIS TARGET SUBSTANTIALLY AND

14:44.137 --> 14:47.724
KEEPS ME SAFE, ALL RIGHT, THE
OPPORTUNE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED.

14:47.758 --> 14:56.275
TIME TO OFFICIALLY THROW THIS
COMPETITION, BUT FIRST MAKE SURE

14:56.310 --> 14:59.344
X-ZAVIER IS SAFE STH WEEK.

14:59.379 --> 15:00.655
COME ON TBIES.

15:00.689 --> 15:01.758
DON'T PUT ME UP.

15:01.793 --> 15:12.034
I'M NOT PUTTING YOU UP, BRO,
I PROMISE.

15:12.068 --> 15:16.310
WHAT?

15:16.344 --> 15:17.620

15:17.655 --> 15:22.000
DEREK X IS THE LAST PERSON TO
DROP, HE WINS H.O.H. AND IT'S AN

15:22.034 --> 15:22.517
INSCRIBABLE FEELING.

15:22.551 --> 15:25.310
I'M SO EXCITED.

15:25.344 --> 15:31.448
CONGRATULATIONS, DEREK, YOU
ARE THE NEW HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD!

15:31.482 --> 15:31.827
WHOOO!

15:31.862 --> 15:32.793
LET'S GO.

15:32.827 --> 15:35.896
THIS IS THE BEST HAVE I FELT IN
THIS HOUSE!

15:35.931 --> 15:38.689
THE WALL COMP IS NOTORIOUS AND I
JUST BEAT OUT EVERYONE.

15:38.724 --> 15:40.275
I AM ON TOP OF THE WORLD.

15:40.310 --> 15:43.137
THIS FEELS AMAZING.

15:43.172 --> 15:44.586
THAT WAS AMAZING.

15:44.620 --> 15:47.896
I MADE A DEAL WITH DEREK TO
ENSURE THAT I WAS GOING TO BE

15:47.931 --> 15:50.241
SAFE FOR THE WEEK NO MATTER
WHAT.

15:50.275 --> 15:54.275
AND SEE IF MAYBE CAN I KEEP THE
REST OF THE FORMER KIPGS SAFE.

15:54.310 --> 15:57.931
BUT FOR ME TO BE SCREAMING IN
FRONT OF EVERYONE, HEY, BABY D,

15:57.965 --> 16:08.241
KEEP THE KINGS SAFE, ISN'T A
GOOD LOOK.

16:08.275 --> 16:08.793
DEAL?

16:08.827 --> 16:12.034
BE GREAT, BE GREAT.

16:12.068 --> 16:14.103
GOOD JOB.

16:14.137 --> 16:16.310
I'M JUST SO DEFEATEDMENT I
DON'T EVEN WANT TO LOOK AT

16:16.344 --> 16:17.413
ANYONE.

16:17.448 --> 16:20.034
I HONESTLY FEEL REALLY GOOD
ABOUT DEREK X WINNING.

16:20.068 --> 16:24.034
HE IS IN THE ROYAL FLUSH AND I
THINK DEREK X KNOWS THE BEST

16:24.068 --> 16:25.793
MOVE FOR HIM IS KEEP GETTING OUT
PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT IN THE ROYAL

16:25.827 --> 16:26.000
FLUSH.

16:38.137 --> 16:40.517
I'M H.O.H., THE POWER IS
SETTING IN.

16:40.551 --> 16:44.206
GIVE ME MORE POWER, I WANT
SOMETHING SPICY, I WANT IN TO BE

16:44.241 --> 16:47.241
AN EXCITING WEEK, BUT IT ST
GOING TO BE A TRICKEE BALANCING

16:47.275 --> 16:48.379
ACT.

16:48.413 --> 16:52.241
CAN I MAKE AN EASY MOVE PUTTING
UP TWO FORMER JOCKERS.

16:52.275 --> 16:56.068
BE OR I CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
THIS POWER AND TAKE A SHOT AT

16:56.103 --> 17:00.241
THE KING SIDE OF THE ROYAL
FLUSH.

17:00.275 --> 17:05.724
NOTHING IS EASY IN THIS HOUSE.

17:05.758 --> 17:10.241
I NEEDED ONE MORE.

17:10.275 --> 17:14.827
I JUST WOULD HAVE LIKED TO
SAY I WON SOMETHING.

17:14.862 --> 17:21.206
I JUST FEEL LIKE I SUCK AT COMPS
AND EVERYONE IN THIS HOUSE

17:21.241 --> 17:23.413
EXPECTS ME TO SUCK AT COMPS.

17:23.448 --> 17:26.758
DEREK TOLD ME I'M NOT GOING
ON THE BLOCK SO I FEEL GOOD WITH

17:26.793 --> 17:28.068
DEREK.

17:28.103 --> 17:32.551
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE HIS HEAD
LIES AS FAR AS THE ROYAL FLUSH.

17:32.586 --> 17:40.241
I DON'T KNOW.

17:40.275 --> 17:58.758
MAKE ME A HOT DOG.

17:58.793 --> 18:01.448
IT IS THE BLING AROUND THE
NECK FOR ME.

18:01.482 --> 18:02.896
IT IS SAFETY FOR ME.

18:02.931 --> 18:04.586
I COULD NOT BE MORE THRILLED.

18:04.620 --> 18:07.034
I AM OVER THE MOON.

18:07.068 --> 18:08.275
SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW.

18:08.310 --> 18:10.172
I BASICALLY WANT HIS H.O.H.

18:10.206 --> 18:11.482
TO BE MY H.O.H.

18:11.517 --> 18:17.689
I KNOW THAT MY NAME HAS BEEN IN
SARAH BETH'S-- AND CHRISTIAN PUT

18:17.724 --> 18:18.655
ME ON THE BLOCK LAST WEEK.

18:18.689 --> 18:28.275
THE PLAN IS TO BE IN DEREK X'S
EAR ALL WEEK.

18:28.310 --> 18:47.103
DUDE, I DON'T WANT-- I'M SO
PROUD OF YOU.

18:47.137 --> 18:52.275
OKAY, WE'LL DO A LITTLE-- .

18:52.310 --> 18:56.482
ALL RIGHT.

18:56.517 --> 18:59.827
BEFORE I DROPPED, I DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH LEFT, I WAS LIKE IF WE GO

18:59.862 --> 19:03.931
DOWN AGAIN, I'M GONE EITHER WAY.

19:03.965 --> 19:06.517
IF HE PUT-- HE WOULDN'T PUT
ME UP.

19:06.551 --> 19:07.793
I HAVE ALL CONFIDENCE.

19:07.827 --> 19:12.551
HE IS NOT GOING TO PUT ME OR
YOU UP BECAUSE WE MADE A DEAL.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.689
HONESTLY I WOULD HAVE LOVED
TO KEEP CHRISTIAN SAFE AS WELL

19:14.724 --> 19:17.172
BUT WHEN ARE YOU ON THAT WALL
YOU ARE MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE

19:17.206 --> 19:21.724
SAFE NO MATTER WHAT SO I CUT A
DEAL TO KEEP MYSELF SAFE BEFORE

19:21.758 --> 19:24.172
I SLIPPED MYSELF.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.517
I'M GOING TO BE QUICK.

19:26.551 --> 19:28.275
GOOD JOB, Y'ALL.

19:28.310 --> 19:35.862
Y'ALL ARE BOTH CHAMPS.

19:35.896 --> 19:42.275
I TALKED TO YOU-- TODAY, TO
CLEAR THE AIR BETWEEN US AND

19:42.310 --> 19:46.241
TOLD HER I WANT TO WORK TOGETHER
AND I'M THINKING WE ARE GOOD

19:46.275 --> 19:46.551
NOW.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.758
COOL.

19:47.793 --> 19:52.275
I WAS PASSIONATELY THROWING
HANNAH'S NAME ALL AROUND THE

19:52.310 --> 19:53.655
HOUSE HAST WEEK.

19:53.689 --> 19:57.586
SO IT WOULD BE-- STUPID OF ME TO
THINK SHE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT IT.

19:57.620 --> 20:02.482
SO RIGHT BEFORE LIVE EVICTION I
DECIDED TO APPROACH HANNAH AND

20:02.517 --> 20:06.034
SEE IF THERE WAS ANYWAY WE COULD
CLEAR THE AIR AND POSSIBLY WORK

20:06.068 --> 20:06.965
TOGETHER.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.862
IF I WIN H.O.H. ARE YOU NOT
MY TAR GET.

20:08.896 --> 20:10.620
I'M NOT COMING AFTER YOU AT ALL.

20:10.655 --> 20:12.551
AND I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU
KNOW THAT.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.034
OKAY.

20:14.068 --> 20:15.551
BECAUSE I WOULD LOVE TO WORK
TOGETHER.

20:15.586 --> 20:16.241
I APPRECIATE IT.

20:16.275 --> 20:20.517
I'M REALLY GLAD WE HAD IT.

20:20.551 --> 20:21.551
THANK YOU.

20:21.586 --> 20:24.137
I THINK HANNAH IS A SMART
PLAYER.

20:24.172 --> 20:27.620
I'M SURE SHE DOESN'T TRUST ME
100% AND I DON'T TRUST HER 100%

20:27.655 --> 20:28.758
EITHER.

20:28.793 --> 20:32.068
HOWEVER I DO THINK THIS
CONVERSATION WAS ENOUGH TO AT

20:32.103 --> 20:44.034
LEAST SMOOTH THINGS OVER FOR
THIS WEEK UNTIL HANNAH GOES

20:44.068 --> 20:45.310
HOME.

20:45.344 --> 20:49.689
EVEN THOUGH ALYSSA DID NOT
INCLUDE ME IN HER-- FOR SAFETY,

20:49.724 --> 20:53.275
I FEEL GOOD, X-ZAVIER LETS ME
KNOW THAT I WAS INCLUDED IN HIS

20:53.310 --> 21:00.241
DEAL AFTER DEREK X DROPS SO I
REALLY FEEL OKAY.

21:00.275 --> 21:20.448
I REALLY THINK-- ALYSSA AND
X-- OKAY, I SAID ALYSSA ARE YOU

21:20.482 --> 21:25.551
NOT-- .

21:25.586 --> 21:28.586
ALYSSA BEING SAFE THROWS A
WRENCH IN MY PLANS BECAUSE SHE

21:28.620 --> 21:32.000
IS NOT IN MY GROUP OF 11 THAT I
WANT TO HAVE IN SWRIR SO THINGS

21:32.034 --> 21:34.862
ARE GOING TO GET A LITTLE TRICKY
THIS WEEK.

21:34.896 --> 21:39.206
I WANT THE KINGS-- THEY ARE
WALKING AROUND WITH FOUR PEOPLE,

21:39.241 --> 21:41.310
OR WALKING AROUND WITH THREE
PEOPLE.

21:41.344 --> 21:50.965
YOU JUST DO YOUR THING AND
RESPECT-- .

21:51.000 --> 21:55.896
I DONE KNOW WHAT TO DO.

21:55.931 --> 21:58.103
WE WILL HAVE A TALK LATER
TONIGHT.

21:58.137 --> 22:00.206
IF I'M NOT PARRED FROM THE
H.O.H. ROOM.

22:00.241 --> 22:02.172
I'M THINK APPROXIMATING GOING
AFTER CHRISTIAN BECAUSE I FEW

22:02.206 --> 22:04.482
HIM AS THE BIGGEST TAR GET IN
THIS HOUSE.

22:04.517 --> 22:07.448
HE HAS AN OVER 50% WIN RATE WHEN
IT COMES TO COMPS.

22:07.482 --> 22:10.689
I NEED TO GET THIS DPIE OUT OF
HERE BECAUSE IF I DON'T HE WILL

22:10.724 --> 22:16.758
TAKE ME OUT.

22:16.793 --> 22:21.965
YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR SHOT,
IF YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
I WANT TO BACK DOOR HIM.

22:25.034 --> 22:30.689
WE CAN RIDE THE ROYAL FLUSH.

22:30.724 --> 22:35.241
WHAT'S THE ROYAL FLUSH.

22:35.275 --> 22:42.655
HOW DO WE TAKE THE SHOT, THE
BACK DOOR WITH TWO JOCKERS.

22:42.689 --> 22:45.344
YEAH.

22:45.379 --> 22:49.827
HONESTLY, YOU HAVE TO TAKE
YOUR SHOT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO

22:49.862 --> 22:51.068
COMPETE.

22:51.103 --> 22:55.793
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I DO TWO
JOCKERS OR SARAH BETH PLUS A

22:55.827 --> 22:56.275
JOCKER.

22:56.310 --> 23:00.379
PUT UP BRITINI.

23:00.413 --> 23:05.586
YOU THROW THIS UP, IT IS NOT
GOING TO WORK.

23:05.620 --> 23:09.482
YOU ARE ON THAT WALL, WE
COULDN'T DO ITMENT YOU EARNED

23:09.517 --> 23:10.724
THIS.

23:10.758 --> 23:16.172
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE
IN THIS HOUSE THAT ARE VERY

23:16.206 --> 23:20.275
STRONG, I NEED YOUR HELP.

23:20.310 --> 23:23.379
IF I NOMINATE CHRISTIAN THAN
HE IS GUARANTEED TO PLAY IN THE

23:23.413 --> 23:26.689
VETO COMP AND WITH HIS WIN RATE
I THINK THAT HE CAN BEAT ME OUT

23:26.724 --> 23:28.068
AND TAKE HIMSELF OFF THE BLOCK.

23:28.103 --> 23:35.517
SO I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO MY
NOMINATIONS ARE GOING TO BE.

23:35.551 --> 23:39.344
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE JUST TOLD
HANNAH ABOUT THE ROYAL FLISH

23:39.379 --> 23:43.448
ALLIANCE AND MORE SHOCKINGLY IT
WASN'T EVEN ME.

23:43.482 --> 23:50.655
I TIFFANY YOU BLEW THIS ONE.

23:50.689 --> 24:06.724
IT IS NOT LIKE A REAL THING.

24:06.758 --> 24:08.034
THE FLUSH IS FLUSHED, LIKE.

24:08.068 --> 24:11.034
I'M TELLING HANNAH THIS
ALLIANCE IS A ONE WEEK THING SO

24:11.068 --> 24:13.310
THAT ME AN HER CAN MAKE IT
THROUGH THE WEEKMENT I DON'T

24:13.344 --> 24:22.689
WANT TO BE OVERCONFIDENT BUT I
THINK SHE BOUGHT IT.

24:22.724 --> 24:34.689
NO QUESTION.

24:34.724 --> 24:38.482
UH-HUH.

24:38.517 --> 24:49.137
I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE IT
OUT.

24:49.172 --> 24:55.586
YOU GUYS WANT TO-- HE DID.

24:55.620 --> 24:56.275
HE.

24:56.310 --> 24:58.275
TIFFANY, TIFFANY, TIFFANY.

24:58.310 --> 25:03.827
ARE YOU REALLY TELLING HANNAH
WHO IS NOT IN THIS ALLIANCE THAT

25:03.862 --> 25:08.068
YOU HAVE ANOTHER ALLIANCE?

25:08.103 --> 25:12.448
NOW I NEED TO DOWNPLAY THIS
ROYAL FLUSH ALLIANCE TO HANNAH,

25:12.482 --> 25:17.068
JUST TO KEEP HER CALM SO SHE
KNOWS IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

25:17.103 --> 25:25.620
WE WERE SITTING HERE TALKING
TO HANNAH.

25:25.655 --> 25:26.172
THAT'S OKAY.

25:26.206 --> 25:30.689
IT IT DON'T MATTER.

25:30.724 --> 25:36.172
JUST TO BUY HER SOME TIME.

25:36.206 --> 25:36.758
YEAH.

25:36.793 --> 25:41.965
THEY DON'T TRUST ME.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.413
IT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH YOU.

25:46.448 --> 25:47.620
I GET IT.

25:47.655 --> 25:51.206
COME ON NOW, TIFF, YOU AND I
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SOLID.

25:51.241 --> 25:56.241
I WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED BEING
KEPT IN THE LOOP.

25:56.275 --> 25:59.689
TAKING AN INVENTORY OF THE FACT
THAT NO ONE CHOSE TO TELL ME

25:59.724 --> 26:01.517
ABOUT THE ROYAL FLUSH.

26:01.551 --> 26:04.344
I'M GOING TO KEEP THIS
INFORMATION IN MY BACK POCKET

26:04.379 --> 26:07.275
AND MAYBE USE IT AS AMMUNITION
LATER.

26:07.310 --> 26:08.103
I'M SO SORRY.

26:08.137 --> 26:09.068
NO, THAT'S OKAY.

26:09.103 --> 26:09.793
I WAS JUST WONDERING.

26:09.827 --> 26:10.689
OKAY.

26:10.724 --> 26:12.551
IS THAT WHY I WAS YOU UP ON
THE BLOCK.

26:19.310 --> 26:20.793
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.

26:20.827 --> 26:23.827
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE AROUND ME.

26:23.862 --> 26:25.310
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE
UNCOMFORTABLE AROUND YOU BUT

26:25.344 --> 26:27.482
THEY CAN DEFINITELY TELL WHEN
ARE YOU UPSET.

26:27.517 --> 26:33.896
YOU GO FROM HA HA HA TO-- AND
YOU HOLD IT FOR AWHILE.

26:33.931 --> 26:36.827
CRACK A JOKE, PEOPLE THINK ARE
YOU FUNNY, PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

26:36.862 --> 26:38.655
YOU JUST GOT TO KEEP IT UP.

26:38.689 --> 26:39.965
MY FLAW IS MY FACE.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.379
MY FACE SHOWS EVERYTHING.

26:43.413 --> 26:45.758
EVERYONE IN THIS HOUSE ALWAYS
KNOWS I'M ANGRY.

26:45.793 --> 26:48.827
IT IT REALLY, REALLY, REALLY IS
SOMETHING I NEED TO WORK ON OR

26:48.862 --> 26:50.689
IT IS DISPING TO AFFECT MY GAME.

26:50.724 --> 26:55.724

26:59.965 --> 27:03.758
IN THIS GAME YOU HAVE TO FAKE
IT UNTIL YOU MAKE IT BABY, YOU

27:03.793 --> 27:07.068
GOT TO SMILE AND LAUGH AND
COMPLIMENT AND JUST SAY YES TO

27:07.103 --> 27:07.758
EVERYTHING.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.034
I HAVE HAD A FACE LIKE A BOOK.

27:09.068 --> 27:12.482
PEOPLE COULD READ EXACTLY WHAT
SHE IS THINKING SO I'M TEACHING

27:12.517 --> 27:20.000
HER HOW TO PUT A BOOK COVERING
ON THAT BOOK.

27:20.034 --> 27:21.793
OKAY.

27:25.137 --> 27:27.758
HELLO, I'M HERE.

27:27.793 --> 27:28.620
♪.

27:28.655 --> 27:31.655
THEY CANNOT THINK ARE YOU.

27:31.689 --> 27:37.310
NO, OKAY.

27:37.344 --> 27:43.068
IF I WALK IN LIKE THIS.

27:43.103 --> 27:44.275
[LAUGHTER]
NO!

27:44.310 --> 27:47.034
IN THE REAL WORLD IF I DON'T
FEEL LIKE SMILING, I DON'T

27:47.068 --> 27:49.448
REALLY EEL LIKE I NEED TO
SMILE.

27:49.482 --> 27:51.068
BUT I'M NOT IN THE REAL WORLD.

27:51.103 --> 27:54.344
I'M IN THE BIG BROTHER HOUSE.

27:54.379 --> 27:55.965
DOES THIS WORK GOOD.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.620
IS THIS GOOD?

27:58.655 --> 28:01.827
I'M HAPPY.

28:01.862 --> 28:03.068
SEE?

28:03.103 --> 28:04.758
I WORRY ABOUT YOU WALKING OUT
THERE RIGHT NOW, I HOPE YOU

28:04.793 --> 28:12.034
DON'T DO THAT WHEN YOU WALK OUT
THAT DOOR.

28:12.068 --> 28:18.310
LOOK CUTE.

28:18.344 --> 28:25.275
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE END
OF ME, I'M DEVOURING THAT.

28:25.310 --> 28:28.862
OH, OH MAN.

28:28.896 --> 28:30.137
REALLY.

28:30.172 --> 28:32.448
THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION
YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN YOUR HEAD.

28:32.482 --> 28:33.689
UH-HUH.

28:33.724 --> 28:36.620
ON THE WALL I MADE A A DEAL
WITH X TO GUARANTEE HIM SAFETY

28:36.655 --> 28:39.965
BUT THEN AFTER WE FELL, HE TRIED
TO MAKE A DEAL WITH ME TO

28:40.000 --> 28:41.172
GUARANTEE HIS TEAM'S SAFETY.

28:41.206 --> 28:44.241
YO, MAN, THIS ISN'T THE BIG
BROTHER BURGER JOINT, YOU CAN'T

28:44.275 --> 28:46.689
JUST COME BACK AND ADD TO YOUR
ORDER.

28:46.724 --> 28:50.586
I GAVE YOU SAFETY, NOT YOUR
TEAM, WE GOT TO OWN UP TO THAT.

28:50.620 --> 28:55.965
SO WHEN WE HAD ON THE WALL
DEAL MADE ON THE WALL I PLAN TO

28:56.000 --> 28:57.206
FULLY RESPECT.

28:57.241 --> 28:59.482
BUT I DO NEED TO CLARIFY WITH
YOU, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE

28:59.517 --> 29:00.620
DEAL WE MADE ON THE WALL.

29:00.655 --> 29:03.517
I KNOW ON THE WALL IT WAS ME
AND AFTERWARDS IT WHAT

29:03.551 --> 29:06.896
POTENTIALLY TO EP COO THE KINGS
SAFE TOO.

29:06.931 --> 29:08.206
OKAY.

29:08.241 --> 29:11.758
REGARDING MY TEAM, OBVIOUSLY,
OR MY FORMER TEAM HAVE I LOYALTY

29:11.793 --> 29:14.827
FOR THEM, SO THIS F THEY ARE
SAFE, THAT'S BREAT BUT AT THE

29:14.862 --> 29:18.310
END OF THE DAY I KNOW YOU ARE
H.O.H. AND HAS TO DO THE END OF

29:18.344 --> 29:23.724
YOU, BUT THE ONE THAT EVERYONE
CLEARLY HEARD, I WOULD

29:23.758 --> 29:24.965
SAY-- AFFECTS YOUR GAME.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.310
YES, 1 MUN%, ARE YOU GOOD,
NOT GOING TO BE NOMINATED, NOT

29:27.344 --> 29:28.448
GOING TO GO HOME.

29:28.482 --> 29:31.206
I APPRECIATE THAT.

29:31.241 --> 29:34.793
A LITTLE CONFUSED BECAUSE THE
FORMER KINGS ARE MEMBERS OF THE

29:34.827 --> 29:37.724
ROYAL FLUSH WHICH DEREK X IS
ALSO PART OF.

29:37.758 --> 29:43.827
SO WHY ARE THE KINGS EVEN BEING
LOOKED AT AS POTENTIAL

29:43.862 --> 29:44.655
NOMINATION.

29:44.689 --> 29:46.620
I NEVER REALLY GET WHAT HE IS
DOING.

29:46.655 --> 29:50.758
IF YOU WERE TO TAKE A SHOT AT
MY TEAM, WHO WOULD YOU FEEL MOST

29:50.793 --> 29:52.758
COMFORTABLE TAKING A SMOT AT.

29:52.793 --> 29:55.965
DO YOU MIND SHARE YURG
THOUGHT PROCESS AND WHY ARE YOU

29:56.000 --> 29:57.275
ASKING THAT QUESTION.

29:57.310 --> 29:59.965
IF YOU ARE ASKING ME THAT I'M
KEEPING A LISA SAFE THERE IS TWO

30:00.000 --> 30:03.724
PEOPLE LEFT, BETWEEN THOSE TWO
PEOPLE, I THINK PROBABLY KEEPING

30:03.758 --> 30:07.103
A STRONGER COMPETITOR IS BETS
FOR BOTH OF US, UNFORTUNATELY

30:07.137 --> 30:11.275
THAT LEAVES ONE PERSON, I THINK
THAT WOULD MAYBE BE THE AIM TO

30:11.310 --> 30:11.586
MOVE BUT.

30:11.620 --> 30:12.827
YEAH.

30:12.862 --> 30:16.689
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT
WOULD AFFECT THE FLUSH, IF THAT

30:16.724 --> 30:22.517
IS SOMETHING TO CONSIDER AS FAR
ES ALIKE THE ACE, I WOULD

30:22.551 --> 30:27.724
KEEP THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE
A SHOT AT BEFORE ME.

30:27.758 --> 30:30.482
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF WERE YOU
H.O.H. THIS WEEK.

30:30.517 --> 30:33.482
IF IT WERE ME, THE ONLY
PERSON THAT I THINK I WOULD GIVE

30:33.517 --> 30:36.620
A REASON TO COME AFTER ME WOULD
BE BRITINI AND THAT IS SIMPLY

30:36.655 --> 30:45.310
BECAUSE I PUT HER ON THE BLOCK.

30:45.344 --> 30:50.965
WHO DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT
THIS LEAVE THIS WEAKNESS I WOULD

30:51.000 --> 30:56.758
LIKE THE FLUSH OBVIOUSLY TO BE
SAFE.

30:56.793 --> 31:01.034
I ALSO HAD A REALLY FREAT
CONVERSATION WITH HANNAH THIS

31:01.068 --> 31:02.241
WEEK.

31:02.275 --> 31:06.000
BUT I, YEAH, THIS WEEK IS HARD
THERE IS NOT A CLEAR TARGET.

31:06.034 --> 31:07.965
I DON'T, LIKE A HOUSE TARGET.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.655
I KNOW.

31:09.689 --> 31:13.034
I CAN GUARANTEE YOUR SAFETY,
WHAT WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO DO

31:13.068 --> 31:18.000
IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH EACH
OTHER MOVING FORWARD?

31:18.034 --> 31:21.758
I THINK I WOULD BE IN A GOOD
POSITION TO HELP YOU BECAUSE I

31:21.793 --> 31:32.310
FEEL PRETTY, IF AM GET WITH THE
QUEENS AND TIGHT WITH THE KINGS.

31:32.344 --> 31:39.586
WOULD YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE AS
A PAWN THIS WEEK.

31:39.620 --> 31:42.034
I MEAN I WOULD BE UPSET.

31:42.068 --> 31:43.068
I WILL BE COMPLETELY HONEST.

31:43.103 --> 31:45.724
IF I WENT UP I WOULD BE UPSET.

31:45.758 --> 31:47.655
NO, I'M COOL WITH THAT.

31:47.689 --> 31:51.482
THERE IS NO UNIVERSAL THAT I
EXIST IN WHERE I'M OKAY WITH

31:51.517 --> 31:52.310
BEING A PAWN.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.379
AND I NEED TO MAKE THAT CLEAR TO
HIM.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.758
ALL RIGHT, I APPRECIATE IT.

31:55.793 --> 31:56.379
THANK YOU SB.

31:56.413 --> 31:57.620
THANK YOU.

31:57.655 --> 32:00.655
AT THIS POINT PUTTING UP
SARAH BETH AS A PAWN SEEMS LIKE

32:00.689 --> 32:03.275
IT MIGHT DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

32:03.310 --> 32:07.000
I'M HERE TO FURTHER MY OWN GAME
NOT MAKE MORE ENEMIES THIS WEEK

32:20.172 --> 32:25.517
DO YOU KNOW WITH THE MOUTH
OPEN, HE GOES BLIEK THIS.

32:25.551 --> 32:28.448
BIG D CAN SLEEP ANY WARE, HE
CAN SLEEP IN THE NOMINATION

32:28.482 --> 32:33.206
CHAIRS, HE CAN SLEEP ON ITS
LIVING ROOM COUCH.

32:33.241 --> 32:39.206
HE CAN SLEEP ON THE LOUNGE
CHAIRS OUTSIDE BY THE POOL.

32:39.241 --> 32:42.000
BASICALLY ANYWHERE IN THE BIG
BROTHER HOUSE WHERE YOU CAN SIT

32:42.034 --> 32:44.620
OR LIE DOWN, BIG D HAS SLEPT.

32:44.655 --> 32:56.793
THERE HE'S LIKE A BIG, CHOCOLATY
CAT.

32:56.827 --> 32:58.000
SLEEPILY.

32:58.034 --> 33:00.862
IF THERE IS A SLEEPING
COMPETITION, BIG D IS WINNING IT

33:00.896 --> 33:15.724
LYING DOWN FOR SURE.

33:15.758 --> 33:18.793
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS
YOUNESS.

33:18.827 --> 33:22.620
ALYSSA, A BROTHER NEEDS HIS
SLEEP, I PROBABLY COULD GREAT

33:22.655 --> 33:25.241
THE WORLD RECORD FOR NAPPING THE
MOST IN THE WORLD.

33:25.275 --> 33:27.862
MAYBE I SHOULD LOOK INTO THAT, I
SHOULD.

33:27.896 --> 33:34.344
I KNEW IT WAS YOU.

33:34.379 --> 33:35.896
I'M SO NERVOUS.

33:35.931 --> 33:36.862
WHY ARE YOU NERVOUS?

33:36.896 --> 33:37.586
WHOOO.

33:37.620 --> 33:38.827
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE WEEK, MAN.

33:38.862 --> 33:43.000
I KNOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AM BUT
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

33:43.034 --> 33:44.586
YOU'RE NOT STUPID.

33:44.620 --> 33:47.413
BASED ON MY CONVERSATION WITH
SARAH BETH I'M NOT SURE PUTTING

33:47.448 --> 33:50.827
HER UP IS THE RIGHT MOVE FOR MY
GAME.

33:50.862 --> 33:55.517
I'M THINK BEING TAKING A SHOT AT
CHRISTIAN BUT BECAUSE IS HE SUMP

33:55.551 --> 33:59.620
A COMP BEAST YOU CAN'T JUST
NOMINATE HIM IT HAS TO BE A BACK

33:59.655 --> 34:00.896
DOOR.

34:00.931 --> 34:03.965
HAVE I TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE
BEST EXINGS OF PAWN THAT WON'T

34:04.000 --> 34:05.620
BLOW UP IN MY FACE AFTER THIS
WEEK.

34:05.655 --> 34:08.827
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHO,
WHAT IF THEY TOOK A SHOT AT YOU,

34:08.862 --> 34:10.482
IF YOU DIDN'T WIN.

34:10.517 --> 34:13.655
IF YOU DON'T TAKE THE SHOT THAT
ARE NEEDED, IT WILL COME BACK

34:13.689 --> 34:14.551
AND BITE NEW THE ASS.

34:14.586 --> 34:16.689
WHO DO YOU THINK.

34:16.724 --> 34:22.103
DEFINITELY ONE OF THE MEMBERS
ON THE KING.

34:22.137 --> 34:23.241
OKAY.

34:23.275 --> 34:28.689
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO GO
FOR THE PAWN THIS WEEK?

34:28.724 --> 34:36.862
MY WORST FEAR IS THAT IF I AM
A PAWN, BECAUSE YOU KNOW I THINK

34:36.896 --> 34:39.310
HAVE A GREAT SOCIAL.

34:39.344 --> 34:40.551
YOU DO?

34:40.586 --> 34:43.896
THAT SOMEBODY WOULD TAKE
ADVANTAGE, THAT'S MY WORST FEAR,

34:43.931 --> 34:47.310
NOW DO I THINK A GIRL PAWN WOULD
BE SMART?

34:47.344 --> 34:48.413
YES.

34:48.448 --> 34:50.896
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO GO UP
AS A PAWN THIS WEEK?

34:50.931 --> 34:51.655
NO.

34:51.689 --> 34:52.896
OKAY.

34:52.931 --> 34:55.034
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE, THIS
GAME HAS DPOT ME A LITTLE BIT

34:55.068 --> 34:55.827
HARDER.

34:55.862 --> 34:59.034
I AIN'T NO LIT BIT MUCH ANY
MORE.

34:59.068 --> 35:02.310
HERE IS MY QUESTION.

35:02.344 --> 35:07.758
THIS COMPLETELY HYPOTHETICAL,
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO GO AS A

35:07.793 --> 35:10.689
PAWN THIS WEEK?

35:10.724 --> 35:13.482
OH GOD.

35:13.517 --> 35:18.586
LIKE MY HONEST FEAR IN THAT IS
THAT THE MORE I GO UP, I'M

35:18.620 --> 35:23.379
AFRAID OF ONE OF THESE TIMES
WILL BE LIKE SHE'S OUT, BATTER

35:23.413 --> 35:24.620
UP.

35:24.655 --> 35:26.965
OBVIOUSLY I DON'T WANT TO GO ON
THE BLOCK WITHIN THE FORMER

35:27.000 --> 35:30.551
JOCKERS ARE NOT MAKING THIS
EASY, NONE OF THEM WANT TO GO UP

35:30.586 --> 35:34.241
AS PAWN, I WANTS TO MAKE A BIG
MOVE BUT CAN I TELL THAT IF I DO

35:34.275 --> 35:36.896
ITK I'M GOING TO BE BREAKING ALL
THE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE I WITH

35:36.931 --> 35:37.344
THEM.

35:37.379 --> 35:42.068
SO WHAT DO I DO?

35:42.103 --> 35:44.620
INCLUDING PEOPLE THAT YOU
WOULD FEEL MOST COMFORTABLE

35:44.655 --> 35:45.551
SITTING NEXT TO.

35:45.586 --> 35:50.241
I GUESS I WOULD JUST STAY IN
THE GAME.

35:50.275 --> 35:54.000
I WOULD HAVE SAID NO TO
EVERYBODY ELSE.

35:54.034 --> 35:59.103
OKAY.

35:59.137 --> 36:04.344
I HAVE A LOT TO SIFT THROUGH.

36:04.379 --> 36:10.655
I HAVE A TARGET AND I HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT WHO I WANT TO BE A

36:10.689 --> 36:11.931
PAWN.

36:11.965 --> 36:16.689
THE TWO BIGGEST COMPETITORS
IN THIS HOUSE, THE TWO STRONGEST

36:16.724 --> 36:24.206
COMPETITORS ARE YOU AND-- .

36:24.241 --> 36:28.413
I WOULD THINK THE TARGET
WOULD HAVE BEEN SARAH BETH BUT

36:28.448 --> 36:30.655
STRONGLY CONSIDERED CHRISTIAN
BECAUSE ASSUMING THAT HE WOULD

36:30.689 --> 36:31.344
COME AFTER YOU.

36:31.379 --> 36:36.896
DO YOU THINK HE WOULD.

36:36.931 --> 36:44.241
I THINK SO.

36:44.275 --> 36:49.551
BRITINI WILL PUT YOU UP ON
THE BLOCK OVER S, POTENTIALLY

36:49.586 --> 36:55.344
PUT YOU ON THE BLOCK WITHIN MY
GOAL IS TO GET DEREK X TO

36:55.379 --> 36:58.862
STRONGLY CONSIDER TO USE SB AS A
PAWN.

36:58.896 --> 37:02.862
I KNOW SHE AT SOME POINT HAS
BEEN GUNNING FOR ME SO IF THIS

37:02.896 --> 37:05.896
BACK DOOR PLAN TO GET CHRISTIAN
OUT OF THE HOUSE DOESN'T WORK

37:05.931 --> 37:10.724
AND SB ENDS UP GOING HOME
INSTEAD THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE

37:10.758 --> 37:20.068
MORE BENEFIT-- BENEFICIAL TO MY
PERSONAL GAME.

37:20.103 --> 37:23.793
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT PUTTING
UP SARAH BETH.

37:23.827 --> 37:27.206
PUTTING UP BRITINI AND SB WAS
THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF TAKING OUT

37:27.241 --> 37:29.586
CHRISTIAN, SHE IS GOING TO COME
OFF THE BLOCK AND SHE ALREADY

37:29.620 --> 37:32.551
TOLD ME SHE WOULD NOT TAKE THE
WILDCARD.

37:32.586 --> 37:36.344
EVEN IF SHE DOESN'T TAKE OUT
CHRISTIAN, I FEEL LIKE SHE WOULD

37:36.379 --> 37:41.724
COME FOR YOU WHEREAS IF ITS WITH
WHAT BRIT AND SB AND SB GOES

37:41.758 --> 37:47.689
HOME, AT LEAST YOU WILL BE
LOSING SOMEONE WHO YOU KNOW HAS

37:47.724 --> 37:49.000
BEEN ON HER RADAR.

37:49.034 --> 37:52.034
AT THIS POINT I KIND OF WISH
I DID FALL OFF THAT WALL BECAUSE

37:52.068 --> 37:55.000
THIS DECISION IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR
ME.

37:55.034 --> 37:56.482
ON THE ONE HAND I COULD JUST
STICK WITH THE ROYAL FLUSH

37:56.517 --> 38:00.034
ALLIANCE OR DO I PUT UP SARAH
BETH AND GAWSHTY THAT A KING CAN

38:00.068 --> 38:01.310
GO HOME THIS WEEK.

38:01.344 --> 38:05.206
HAVE I TO POTENTIALLY MAKE ONE
OF THE BIGGEST MOVES OF MY GAME

38:05.241 --> 38:12.068
SO FAR AND HAVE I NO CLUE WHAT
THE RIGHT ANSWER IS.

38:12.103 --> 38:14.931
I WILL-- I WILL BE YOUR EYES
AND EARS.

38:14.965 --> 38:16.000
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

38:36.551 --> 38:58.379
HEY GUYS, TIME FOR FOR THE
NOMINATION CEREMONY.

38:58.413 --> 39:04.586
THIS IS THE NOMINATION CEREMONY.

39:04.620 --> 39:08.275
IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITIES
AHEAD OF HOUSEHOLD TO NOMINATE

39:08.310 --> 39:12.379
TWO HOUSEGUESTS FOR EVICTION.

39:12.413 --> 39:14.482
IN MY NOMINATION BLOCK ARE THE
KEYS OF THE HOUSEGUEST I'M

39:14.517 --> 39:15.758
NOMINATING FOR EVICTION.

39:15.793 --> 39:20.931
I WILL TURN TWO KEYS TO LOCK IN
MY NOMINATIONS AND THEIR FACES

39:20.965 --> 39:23.000
WILL APPEAR ON THE MEMORY WALL.

39:23.034 --> 39:40.689
THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST I'VE
NOMINATED IS.

39:40.724 --> 39:57.655
THE NEXT HOIS DPES-- HOUSEGUEST
HAVE I NOMINATED IS.

39:57.689 --> 40:03.034
I'VE NOMINATED YOU SARAH BETH
AND YOU BRITINI BECAUSE IN THIS

40:03.068 --> 40:05.034
GAME THE NUMBER ONE CURRENCY YOU
HAVE IS TRUST.

40:05.068 --> 40:08.655
IN THE PAST 24 HOURS I HAVE HAD
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH EACH

40:08.689 --> 40:12.586
OF YOU INDIVIDUALLY AND I
BELIEVE THIS IS THE BEST MOVE

40:12.620 --> 40:19.655
FOR MY PERSONAL GAME TO KEEP MY
TRUST INSIDE OF THIS HOUSE.

40:19.689 --> 40:22.586
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
DONE.

40:22.620 --> 40:25.241
OF COURSE I'M MAD, I DON'T
WANT TO BE ON THE BLOCK, I

40:25.275 --> 40:28.413
DIDN'T THINK THAT DEREK X WAS
GOING TO TAKE A SHOT THIS EARLY

40:28.448 --> 40:30.758
AT THE ROYAL FLUSH ALLIANCE.

40:30.793 --> 40:34.724
BUT I'M GOING TO BE DOING MY
ABSOLUTE BEST TO WIN THIS VETO.

40:34.758 --> 40:37.482
THIS ABSOLUTELY SUCKS, I'M
THE ONLY PERSON IN THIS HOUSE

40:37.517 --> 40:41.655
THAT HAS NOT ONLY BEEN ON THE
BLOCK THREE TIMES BUT MORE THAN

40:41.689 --> 40:42.793
ONCE.

40:42.827 --> 40:45.620
I WANT TO WIN THIS VETO SO BAD,
SHOVE IT IN ALL THESE

40:45.655 --> 40:49.310
HOUSEGUESTS FACES THAT CAN I
FINALLY WIN A EXUSH AND GET

40:49.344 --> 40:53.137
MYSELF OFF OF THE BLOCK.

40:53.172 --> 40:58.206
I NOMINATED BRITINI AND SARAH
BETH BUT I WANT TO BACK DOOR THE

40:58.241 --> 40:59.448
ONE AND ONLY CHRISTIAN.

40:59.482 --> 41:03.655
