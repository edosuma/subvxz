BKF Productions.
Fun. Freedom. Family values.

00:30.321 --> 00:36.327
The American tradition.
And, as always, hunter approved.

01:01.561 --> 01:04.355
Coming around the bend.
Coming around broadside.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.990
Oh!

01:14.074 --> 01:15.825
One shot. One kill.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.702
Hi. I'm Buck Ferguson.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.996
A long time ago,
I decided to follow my dream

01:20.080 --> 01:22.582
of hunting whitetail deer
all over the world.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.835
Lo and behold, my
dreams have come true.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.713
I've seen the best.
And I've killed the best.

01:28.797 --> 01:33.510
And now I'm here to share with you the
joy I've found in hunting whitetail deer.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.513
Out of all my years hunting,
that is, without a doubt,

01:36.596 --> 01:40.099
the most magnificent creature
I've ever laid eyes on.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.143
You see the points on that thing?

01:48.566 --> 01:50.401
Jumping Joseph!

01:57.575 --> 01:59.953
Yes! Yes! Yes!

02:01.162 --> 02:02.163
What...

02:06.501 --> 02:08.586
I saw him and thought,
"Might as well."

02:08.669 --> 02:10.713
I've got a few notches in my belt,

02:10.797 --> 02:14.717
but tonight's episode isn't just
about killing whitetail deer.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.764
It's also about family.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.891
I suggest you gather you and yours

02:21.975 --> 02:25.979
and sit back to enjoy this very
special edition of Buck Fever.

02:32.026 --> 02:33.778
Just a little more sauce
on the left.

02:33.862 --> 02:34.946
Little more. Okay?

02:35.029 --> 02:36.990
- Is that how you're gonna sit?
- Mmm... Yeah.

02:37.073 --> 02:38.825
Then take it down a notch.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.660
Bring it down. Just a hair.

02:40.743 --> 02:43.037
There. Look at those
beautiful peepers.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.414
That was a good idea, Buck.

02:44.497 --> 02:45.665
You get us both in frame?

02:45.748 --> 02:47.667
I can't get both of you in the frame.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.848
I was gonna pan left and right,
follow the conversation.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.504
No. That's no good, Don.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.673
Jaden and me need to
be in the same frame.

02:53.756 --> 02:55.341
I don't know about that.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.188
Swingles has always been
our bread and butter--

02:57.218 --> 02:59.637
If it's a comedy bit.
But this is an emotional scene.

02:59.721 --> 03:03.016
We gotta sell the father-son
relationship right off the bat.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.310
I'm up against the window.
I can't get much wider.

03:05.393 --> 03:06.489
We gotta figure something out.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.104
If we don't have the building blocks,

03:08.187 --> 03:10.565
the audience won't know
to feel the emotional crescendo

03:10.648 --> 03:12.609
when Jaden kills his first deer.
It won't work.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.861
Okay. Buck, it is gonna work. Okay?

03:14.944 --> 03:17.906
I understand building
dramatic tension as well.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.658
I know this trip means
a lot to you and Jaden.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.410
But believe me,

03:22.493 --> 03:24.787
everything is gonna work
the way it's supposed to.

03:26.789 --> 03:27.790
Raking shot.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.126
- What's that?
- Raking shot.

03:30.209 --> 03:33.379
Camera goes left by the window.
Jaden gets in.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.466
You can see Jaden, but only my eyes.

03:36.549 --> 03:40.293
Slow pan dolly over to me
just as I turn to look at my son.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.264
Saving the reveal of your face
for the button. That is genius.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.600
- Try it out.
- Let me see here.

03:45.683 --> 03:47.268
Bam!

03:47.352 --> 03:49.729
Wow, that is definitely gonna work.

03:49.812 --> 03:51.481
- It is, isn't it?
- Yes.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.860
You know, Don, this will be
the greatest video we've ever made.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.872
- No, Don, stay in the car.
- Copy that.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.295
Hey, Buck.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.172
Looks like somebody's
ready to go hunting.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.685
- Greg? What are you doing here?
- Get your butt out of the cold.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.010
Jaden's upstairs, getting ready.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.638
I'll, uh... Whoo!
Sure is nippy out there.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.723
I'll get him. Make yourself at home.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.685
"Make myself at home."

04:34.065 --> 04:35.275
Psst...

04:35.358 --> 04:36.818
- Oh, hey, Buck.
- Hey.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.790
I'm making breakfast.
Do you want anything to eat?

04:38.820 --> 04:42.031
Oh, no, thanks, Linda.
I stopped at McDonald's on the way.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.034
Oh, don't tell Jaden. He'll be mad
you didn't bring him a McGriddle.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.411
You making bacon?

04:46.995 --> 04:49.455
Man fuel.
That's what I've been waiting for.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.209
Mmm! Thank you so much.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.964
I need to talk to you about Jaden.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.048
What? What is it?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.758
He's been acting out a lot.

05:00.842 --> 05:04.512
If I so much as ask him about school,
he gets upset and plays his video game

05:04.595 --> 05:06.109
and he won't say a
word to me all night.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.183
Getting held back last year
really messed with his head.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.727
It's the teachers' fault.

05:10.810 --> 05:14.188
I mean, everybody knows
that Jaden's not good with tests.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.898
He's a visual learner, like me.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.359
He's not a visual learner, Greg.
He's a regular learner.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.404
I didn't mean it that way. He's
attracted to things like movies--

05:21.487 --> 05:23.573
He's a regular learner.
Leave it alone.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.826
- Hi, Dad.
- Speak of the devil. How you doing, son?

05:26.909 --> 05:28.119
Fine.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.829
Ready to kill your
first whitetail deer?

05:29.912 --> 05:31.748
I'm ready to shoot something.

05:31.831 --> 05:32.999
You bringing that guitar?

05:33.082 --> 05:35.543
- No, I'm carrying it for my health.
- Jaden.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.379
Say goodbye to your mom and Greg.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.381
Just hang on real quick, fellas.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.468
I wanted to get Jaden something
for his first hunting video.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.640
- What is it?
- Go on. Open it.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.483
Ooh! Whoa!

05:59.942 --> 06:01.652
No way!

06:02.361 --> 06:05.740
Well, that's a nice gun, but not
the kind you want to take hunting.

06:05.823 --> 06:06.741
Why not, Buck?

06:06.824 --> 06:08.618
It's overkill.
Too much showboating.

06:08.701 --> 06:14.791
This is awesome. Banana clip. Laser
sight. Matte black. Murdered out.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.668
Does it got a silencer? Nope.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.671
This thing's a certified beast.
Thanks, Greg.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.256
You got it, buddy.

06:26.135 --> 06:30.056
- You remember Don, don't you?
- Oh, yeah, I think so.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.225
How's it going?
It's been a while, huh?

06:32.308 --> 06:35.061
You doing something different
with your hair? A faux-hawk?

06:35.144 --> 06:37.313
It used to be a fade,
but now it's a spike.

06:37.396 --> 06:38.689
My hair's different, too.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.942
I used to do a buzz.
I'm letting it grow out.

06:41.025 --> 06:43.027
The soft curls make my eyes pop.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.821
- Don, you ready to work now?
- Yeah.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.405
We're ready. We're rolling.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.909
Hey, Jaden. Look what I got for you.

06:49.992 --> 06:52.870
Oh, Sausage McGriddle!
You know what I like.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.504
Nailed it. Perfect.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.256
Let's go, boys.

It's beautiful country
out here, Buck.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.775
It's been so long
since I've been up here.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.904
These are the same mountains
where I killed my first deer.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.239
I can't believe this day is here.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.910
I hate it when places don't have
Wi-Fi. That's my Achilles' heel.

08:14.035 --> 08:17.246
Wireless access will be
the least of your worries

08:17.330 --> 08:19.874
when you're on
your first whitetail deer hunt.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.293
- Goddamn right.
- Whoo! That's what I'm talking about.

08:22.376 --> 08:25.087
Colorful language.
That's why we leave the women home.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.507
The only women
coming on this trip...

08:27.590 --> 08:30.051
Rosy Palmer and her five sisters.
Look out!

08:31.427 --> 08:32.970
- Whacking off!
- All right, Don.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.222
Tuggin' on your tallywhacker.

08:34.304 --> 08:36.890
- That's enough.
- Pulling out our wieners and jacking off.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.976
- Hey! Hey!
- The whack-off weekend with--

08:39.059 --> 08:41.979
We talked about that sexual stuff.
Stop it.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.620
Yee-haw!

09:06.212 --> 09:08.339
Come on, Buck!
You want some?

09:08.422 --> 09:10.633
- Smoke him, Dad!
- You bet I will!

09:10.716 --> 09:12.093
Come on!

09:25.606 --> 09:26.816
Come on, Buck!

09:33.489 --> 09:37.243
While we're waiting for the deer,
start popping off some of that B-roll.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.160
Copy that.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.328
And remember, Don.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.415
Fly on the wall with the camera.
Me and Jaden are here to bond.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.666
That can't happen if you...

09:43.749 --> 09:44.959
I'll buzz off. Got it.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.295
All right. Great. Where's Jaden?

09:47.378 --> 09:49.213
He's down there on the phone,
yip-yapping.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.298
Hey! Jaden!

09:50.381 --> 09:52.101
That's the stupidest excuse
I've ever heard.

09:54.093 --> 09:54.927
What?

09:55.011 --> 09:57.388
- Come on. You can call 'em back.
- Gotta go. Bye.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.184
Who were you talking to?

10:02.268 --> 10:03.185
My girlfriend.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.396
And she's mad at me now, by the way.

10:05.479 --> 10:06.897
- Thanks.
- Why?

10:06.981 --> 10:09.734
Because I had to get off the phone,
and she can't talk later.

10:09.817 --> 10:13.112
Don't worry about that right now.
Come on.

10:13.195 --> 10:14.405
Hey, Don. Roll camera.

10:14.488 --> 10:15.488
Hold up.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.243
All right. Good.

10:19.327 --> 10:23.080
All right. Fly on the wall.
I'm not here. Go.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.834
Why don't you have a seat next to me?

10:26.917 --> 10:28.544
I wanna give you something.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.796
What is it?

10:31.547 --> 10:33.007
Open it, son.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.304
An old gun.

10:38.387 --> 10:40.348
Not just any old gun.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.016
It's a Winchester .30-30.

10:42.099 --> 10:44.060
That rifle belonged
to your grandfather.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.438
My father passed it down to me
when I went on my first deer hunt.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.484
Today, I'm giving it to you.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.070
I'm passing down
this lever-action rifle to you,

10:54.153 --> 10:56.739
- as I'm passing down the whitetail legacy.
- Boom!

10:56.822 --> 10:58.199
So now I got two guns.

10:59.617 --> 11:03.371
Jaden, please, I'm trying to share
something with you, son.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.915
My bad. Continue.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.834
This rifle symbolizes
the bond of family.

11:08.918 --> 11:12.254
Fathers teaching their sons to hunt
is a rite of passage as old as time.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.591
With this rifle
comes great responsibility.

11:15.674 --> 11:18.886
And what we're doing out here
is learning to be a man.

11:18.969 --> 11:23.015
When you see your first whitetail
deer, it'll look cute and fluffy,

11:23.099 --> 11:25.017
but you can't get
into those feelings.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.853
We can honor the deer,
but we can't love it.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.937
I'll honor the deer
by splitting his dang eyebrows.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.946
- Can I offer one criticism here?
- Well, sure, son.

11:37.029 --> 11:40.533
The one thing that Greg's gun has
over this one is a laser sight.

11:40.616 --> 11:41.826
That's the one thing.

11:41.909 --> 11:45.246
Is it possible to take off
the laser sight from Greg's gun

11:45.329 --> 11:47.081
and screw it on this old gun?

11:47.164 --> 11:48.791
Or just think of
this one as a backup?

11:48.874 --> 11:51.085
Let's cut, Don. I think we got that.

12:03.639 --> 12:06.517
♪ D for disaster
E for my eyes ♪

12:06.600 --> 12:09.562
♪ A for my anger

12:09.645 --> 12:12.857
♪ Dead moon night,
dead moon night ♪

12:33.627 --> 12:35.671
Jaden. Jaden.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.887
Put those away
and help me look for this deer.

12:42.970 --> 12:46.348
Let me finish this track.
This is my favorite song.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.685
- Now.
- Fine.

12:53.147 --> 12:58.777
I'm hungry. You know what I could go
for? Turkey panini. Paninis are good.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.696
We've been out here 20 minutes.
Have patience.

13:00.779 --> 13:03.407
I am patient.
But I'm starting to get hungry.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.951
I haven't even got
to shoot my gun.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.746
I thought we'd be straight
killing stuff the whole time.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.080
- This is boring.
- Okay.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.999
We are gonna shoot the guns.

13:12.082 --> 13:15.294
Hunting's about more than just
killing. It's about patience.

13:15.377 --> 13:18.797
Can I call Caroline
and tell her that I can't call her?

13:18.881 --> 13:20.132
So she won't worry.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.885
No. Caroline will be fine.
Focus on the deer.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.261
What deer?

13:24.345 --> 13:25.638
Shh!

13:43.989 --> 13:47.034
- Whitetail. Jaden, whitetail.
- Where?

13:47.117 --> 13:48.244
Across that field there.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.328
I see it.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.164
- This is awesome.
- Go get your rifle.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.417
Do you see that? Amazing.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.589
That is a nice first deer.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.805
- What are you doing with that thing?
- Fixing to shoot this dang deer.

14:07.888 --> 14:10.558
Put down Greg's gun
and get your grandfather's rifle!

14:10.641 --> 14:11.850
Fine. Dang.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.106
Right there.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.983
Should I go ahead and
punch the time card?

14:19.066 --> 14:21.527
No, not yet.
Just keep him in your sights.

14:21.610 --> 14:22.778
I will.

14:32.621 --> 14:33.621
There it is.

14:36.041 --> 14:36.876
Drop him now?

14:36.959 --> 14:39.211
No, not yet. Wait until he stops.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.295
Yes, sir.

14:41.922 --> 14:45.509
Oh, my God! I can't believe
this moment is here.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.179
Take the shot.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.072
What the hell is that?

15:10.367 --> 15:11.660
Caroline.

15:13.120 --> 15:17.207
Because you were supposed to call me
back! Nothing. What are you doing?

15:18.834 --> 15:20.252
Swimming? That's cool.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.589
I'll ask my dad if I
can come over later.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.384
Actually, no, I'm not.

15:28.636 --> 15:29.887
It's just weird.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.734
If you don't like him,
why would you wanna go?

15:31.764 --> 15:33.599
That's what I don't get.

15:33.682 --> 15:37.436
But y'all ain't even friends.
I just think it's peculiar.

15:37.519 --> 15:40.105
I know why it's peculiar!
I'm the one who taught you that!

15:41.357 --> 15:44.193
I'm afraid to say it,
but I'm worried about Jaden.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.487
I feel like right before the divorce,

15:46.570 --> 15:49.615
like something bad has happened
and there's no way of stopping it.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.158
Oh, no, no. Come on, now.

15:51.241 --> 15:54.370
He's just got himself
a little girlfriend. That's all.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.831
I know. But we're talking about
Jaden's future here.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.459
He's 12 years old.
Getting older every day.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.139
If he doesn't take to hunting now,
he may never.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.963
Oh, hey, now. Come on.

16:04.046 --> 16:07.716
It's still very early on the trip.
We got a few days now, huh?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.593
He ain't doing too bad.
Don't worry.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.054
You think he has bigger muscles
than me? Seriously?

16:12.680 --> 16:14.515
Have you seen me lately?

16:15.516 --> 16:17.726
- I love you, too.
- At least he's thinking about pussy.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.604
Call me in five minutes.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.636
- Tell me you got that.
- Oh, I got it.

17:22.665 --> 17:25.419
Jumping Joseph!
You see the size of that thing?

17:25.502 --> 17:27.003
- It's huge.
- Oh, my God!

17:27.087 --> 17:28.756
I've never seen anything like it.

17:28.839 --> 17:32.801
Look at that drop tine.
That's gotta be at least 20 points.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.804
- How old do you think it is?
- At least five years old.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.348
That's what I call a non-typical.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.475
God!

17:39.558 --> 17:42.853
That was pretty cool.
That deer looked crazy.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.315
I gotta say. I was having my doubts.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.817
This changes everything.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.528
- That non-typical is a sign from God.
- Amen.

17:51.612 --> 17:55.282
That deer is God saying
that this trip is blessed.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.326
- Hallelujah.
- That deer is our destiny,

17:57.409 --> 17:59.328
and it will take us
to the promised land.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.455
We're gonna follow
that trail upriver.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.957
Oh, my God, son...

18:04.041 --> 18:06.752
If you could kill that deer...
Oh, my Lord.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.339
Should we start tracking it, Buck?

18:10.422 --> 18:12.216
It's too late for
ground-hunting tonight.

18:12.299 --> 18:15.302
We'll probably make camp
right here on this sacred ground.

18:15.385 --> 18:17.221
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

18:18.222 --> 18:21.225
That's good, 'cause my underwear's
riding up something serious.

18:21.308 --> 18:24.853
- Oh, you got swamp ass.
- Probably. It's wet as hell down there.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.195
Don, those hot beans
are smelling delicious.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.030
Jaden, you'll love these.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.865
How do you make them spicy, again?

18:36.949 --> 18:38.367
- Piquante salsa.
- Salsa.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.911
Mixes hot salsa with the beans.

18:40.994 --> 18:43.831
Your mouth will thank you,
but your butthole will hate you.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.874
This is a real ring-stinger.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.628
There you go. Home sweet home.

18:50.379 --> 18:53.006
Sleeping on the ground is
gonna play hell on my back.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.716
Who's sleeping on the ground?

18:57.469 --> 18:59.847
- What is it?
- It's an air mattress.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.808
Mattress Masters gave
it to me to try out.

19:02.891 --> 19:07.396
Got king size. Inflatable box
springs. Attachable bed skirt.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.731
I guess that's better than nothing.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.400
I'd say it's a lot
better than nothing.

19:11.483 --> 19:15.195
Your back will think it's sleeping
on a bed of feathers.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.990
You're pretty good
at this outdoorsy stuff.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.159
I've been doing it my whole life.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.536
Don't worry.
You'll be good at it, too, one day.

19:22.619 --> 19:26.248
I guess. I've always considered
myself more of a Marriott guy.

19:27.332 --> 19:30.627
By the way, I'm noticing
a butt-ton of blood on your boots.

19:30.711 --> 19:34.131
It's good luck. It's what
happens when you kill a deer.

19:34.214 --> 19:37.634
- That's nasty.
- Yeah. But it's tradition.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.514
I remember my dad always had blood
on his boots from hunting.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.391
I used to look at them with envy.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.686
I had these clean Buster Brown boots.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.147
I couldn't wait to get blood on them.

19:50.939 --> 19:55.027
Then one day, when I killed my first deer,
the first thing I did was run over there,

19:55.110 --> 19:57.779
I stuck my boots underneath,
I sloshed all around.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.157
Got them completely covered.

20:00.949 --> 20:04.620
I bet by the time this trip's over,
you'll have blood all over your boots.

20:05.245 --> 20:06.872
Nuh-uh. These are Timberlands.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.707
You'll see.

20:09.583 --> 20:13.503
I'll just turn this thing on now.
There we go.

20:31.688 --> 20:33.357
There we go. A bit for me.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.735
- There we go. Thank you.
- A lot for Don.

20:36.818 --> 20:40.781
Little bit of whiskey for
Jaden there. There you go.

20:40.864 --> 20:45.953
All right. A toast.
To past victories and future success.

20:46.036 --> 20:49.957
To fathers and sons.
And to that big old non-typical!

20:50.040 --> 20:51.667
Whoo-hoo!

20:54.002 --> 20:55.295
Whoo!

20:55.921 --> 20:57.756
That burns more than scotch.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.883
When have you ever had scotch?

20:59.967 --> 21:01.343
Greg let me have a sip.

21:02.302 --> 21:03.762
Scotch.

21:03.845 --> 21:06.807
I like my whiskey American.
Just like my cheese.

21:06.890 --> 21:10.811
In all my world travels, I've had
Swiss cheese, French Brie cheese,

21:10.894 --> 21:12.688
every kind of cheese you can name.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.607
And I like processed
American slices the best.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.026
Kraft cheese melts the best.
That's why I like it.

21:18.110 --> 21:21.613
I'm just not one who thinks
it's better 'cause it's foreign.

21:23.407 --> 21:24.992
- Could I have some more?
- Look out.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.619
Jaden got himself a
taste for the whiskey.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.622
Just a little bit, though.
Just a little.

21:30.706 --> 21:31.706
Whoo!

21:31.748 --> 21:32.833
- You, too, Don?
- Whoo-hoo!

21:32.916 --> 21:34.459
He ain't gonna outdrink me.

21:35.085 --> 21:38.588

22:19.713 --> 22:22.924
It's good. I had trouble
following the story of the song,

22:23.008 --> 22:25.052
but it was good. It was good.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.679
- How long you been playing for?
- Two years.

22:27.763 --> 22:30.766
Two years. Wow, I had no idea.

22:31.475 --> 22:34.436
Ah, hold up.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.607
It's Caroline. Dang. Hold on.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.071
- Everything all right?
- It's fine.

22:44.988 --> 22:46.656
Tell me
about this girl you're dating.

22:46.740 --> 22:50.660
- You go to the same school?
- No. She's already in middle school.

22:50.744 --> 22:55.582
Oh, middle school. Uh-oh, look out.
Jaden's got himself an older woman.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.626
No. Jaden got held back a year.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.044
Oh.

22:59.127 --> 23:02.631
It's nothing to be ashamed of,
right, son? It's all good.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.841
Did I tell you I got a girlfriend?

23:04.925 --> 23:07.761
Yes, I do. Her name's Kimberly.

23:07.844 --> 23:09.429
I got a photograph of her here.

23:09.513 --> 23:11.932
There she is. Ninety-eight pounds.

23:12.015 --> 23:14.226
I call her my little spinner.
Wanna know why?

23:14.309 --> 23:15.352
Why?

23:15.435 --> 23:16.948
Because I set her up
on the tip of my pecker

23:16.978 --> 23:19.106
and spin her around
like a spinning top.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.943
All right, Don. That's enough.

23:23.026 --> 23:25.779
Oh, God, love her.

23:25.862 --> 23:29.783
After this trip, me and her are gonna
visit her folks in Kentucky. Phew.

23:29.866 --> 23:32.911
They got it figured out.
They got this beautiful land.

23:32.994 --> 23:36.706
Great big farm. All they do
is sit around watching TV.

23:36.790 --> 23:37.990
Don't they have a farm to run?

23:38.583 --> 23:40.347
I guess. I ain't never
seen them do it, though.

23:40.377 --> 23:42.337
All I see them do
is watch television.

23:42.420 --> 23:43.672
That is gangster.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.799
Sounds kind of boring to me.

23:45.882 --> 23:49.636
Me and Kimberly like it,
so it's not that boring to me.

23:49.719 --> 23:51.930
How about you, Dad?
You got a girlfriend?

23:52.013 --> 23:54.891
Who, Buck? The only tail
your dad is chasing is whitetail.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.309
Yeah. That's right.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.687
Maybe you should start dating again.

23:58.770 --> 24:02.190
No, no, no. I'm all right as is.
I'm doing just fine.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.276
Probably be good for you.

24:04.943 --> 24:08.947
Seems like Mom is moving on. Her and
Greg are talking about getting married.

24:09.906 --> 24:11.366
They're talking about what?

24:11.449 --> 24:14.661
He hasn't officially asked her yet,
but she knows it's coming.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.538
They talk about it all the time.

24:16.621 --> 24:19.249
Shoot. That's ridiculous.

24:19.332 --> 24:21.751
The ink on the divorce
is barely even dry.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.837
It has been two years, Buck.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.422
What are you, a human calendar?

24:25.505 --> 24:28.008
Mr. Trapper Keeper?
I know how long it's been.

24:28.091 --> 24:31.428
God! Shoot. I hate selfish people!

24:31.511 --> 24:32.804
I'll give it to him, though.

24:32.888 --> 24:36.141
Greg told me some of his ideas
for when he proposes.

24:36.224 --> 24:38.560
Man,
that dude has a great imagination.

24:38.643 --> 24:42.105
He was talking about all these
crazy things like skydiving.

24:43.481 --> 24:44.816
Where you going?

24:44.900 --> 24:46.484
I'm gonna go take a leak.

25:34.824 --> 25:36.243

26:45.520 --> 26:47.772
You know better
than to pull a stunt like this.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.607
You could have hurt yourself.

26:49.691 --> 26:50.817
Sorry. Dang!

26:50.900 --> 26:52.485
What is going on in your mind?

26:52.569 --> 26:54.738
I just wanted to ride
and y'all were asleep.

26:54.821 --> 26:57.073
You realize I have to pay
for that four-wheeler now?

26:57.157 --> 26:59.242
You realize how much they cost?

27:00.493 --> 27:02.078
Why are you recording?

27:02.162 --> 27:04.039
This isn't part of the narrative.

27:04.122 --> 27:07.083
I figured it might make
a good mid-point crisis--

27:07.167 --> 27:08.418
Shut the camera off.

27:08.501 --> 27:11.046
Trying to have a moment with my son.
Remove yourself.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.129
Yeah, okay.

27:14.591 --> 27:18.511
This sucks. If you let me drive, then
we wouldn't be in this predicament.

27:18.595 --> 27:21.723
You shouldn't have taken out
the four-wheeler without permission.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.934
Fine. I'm the devil.
I'm a terrible person.

27:26.644 --> 27:28.563
- Who are you calling?
- Nobody.

27:28.646 --> 27:30.565
Dang, I'm making a video for my blog.

27:30.648 --> 27:33.401
What's up?
This is Jaden running around here,

27:33.485 --> 27:35.195
hunting in the woods with my dad.

27:35.278 --> 27:36.780
Sucks.

27:36.863 --> 27:39.616
Leave me some comments
if you hate hunting, too.

27:39.699 --> 27:40.992
Give it.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.243
What are you doing?

27:42.327 --> 27:44.621
I told you one too many times
to stay off the phone.

27:44.704 --> 27:46.081
But that's my private property.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.208
I'm keeping this
until the end of the trip.

27:48.291 --> 27:50.502
For the next few days,
you have to go without it.

27:50.585 --> 27:51.628
What about Caroline?

27:51.711 --> 27:55.632
The world isn't gonna end if you can't
call your girlfriend for three days.

27:55.715 --> 27:57.675
But we're each other's
support system.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.886
The cell phone is mine. Topic closed.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.181
You're ruining my life
and you don't even care.

28:03.264 --> 28:06.267
Maybe I'm ruining your life
'cause you're being a damn idiot.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.769
Don't call me an idiot!

28:08.395 --> 28:10.188
- Okay.
- Take it back.

28:10.271 --> 28:12.774
I take it back.
It's not like I meant it.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.859
Let's forget about it.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.779
Now what about that non-typical
we saw yesterday?

28:17.862 --> 28:20.490
How'd you like to
bag that son of a gun, huh?

28:20.573 --> 28:23.451
Come on, we're hunting.
Let's have fun.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.371
I can't stand you sometimes.

28:34.921 --> 28:37.507
I see you peeking out
from behind that tree.

28:37.590 --> 28:39.217
This is not going in the cut.

28:41.636 --> 28:43.680
After experiencing
some technical difficulties

28:43.763 --> 28:45.223
with one of our four-wheelers,

28:45.306 --> 28:47.016
we decided to go on foot.

28:47.100 --> 28:50.854
Nothing was gonna keep Jaden and me
from catching that monster non-typical.

28:52.021 --> 28:56.735
When things don't go right, a true hunter
straps on his boots and marches on.

29:00.196 --> 29:01.990
Just when we thought
we'd lost the trail,

29:02.073 --> 29:04.909
I noticed a whole mess of tracks
by the river.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.327
This was a good sign.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.956
It looked like a well-traveled doe
trail, and like every hunter knows,

29:10.039 --> 29:12.792
where there's a doe,
a buck is not far behind.

29:13.793 --> 29:16.671
I showed Jaden how
the doe trail followed up the river.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.924
Our non-typical was leading us
even deeper into the mountains,

29:20.008 --> 29:22.051
miles away from human contact.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.137
Almost as if it was calling us.

29:24.220 --> 29:27.223
Just like life,
hunting comes with no guarantees.

29:27.307 --> 29:30.143
But I don't usually have a problem
finding the big deer,

29:30.226 --> 29:33.188
especially with that old
Sniper 2000 stuff I use.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.032
That's what I'm talking about.

29:44.115 --> 29:46.826
It's like he doesn't even care
about catching this deer.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.829
This trip was supposed to be
a way for us to bond.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.625
Yeah, well, it doesn't
look like that's happening.

29:53.708 --> 29:56.252
- Jesus, Don.
- What? I'm agreeing with you.

29:56.336 --> 29:57.879
It doesn't look like it's happening.

29:57.962 --> 30:00.048
- Yeah, well, stop.
- Okay. Copy that.

30:02.217 --> 30:05.845
I was hoping to discuss something
with you, if you don't mind.

30:05.929 --> 30:07.180
Yeah, what?

30:07.263 --> 30:12.060
Well, I was thinking maybe after this trip
I go ahead and take a little time off.

30:12.143 --> 30:14.020
What? Time off?

30:14.103 --> 30:17.482
Yeah, you know, I told you
about Kimberly's parents' farm.

30:17.565 --> 30:20.068
We were thinking
maybe going up there,

30:20.151 --> 30:24.781
spend a little time, uh,
hang out there. See how it fits us.

30:24.864 --> 30:26.533
But we got Washington next month.

30:26.616 --> 30:30.370
That's the thing. I was thinking maybe
you go up alone and I sit this one out.

30:30.453 --> 30:34.123
But we gotta shoot Buck Ferguson
Takes On the Great Northwest.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.334
Well, Buck, to be honest,

30:36.417 --> 30:39.128
Kimberly's getting sick
of me leaving all the time.

30:39.212 --> 30:41.589
She's throwing around the "R" word.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.633
What's that word?

30:43.716 --> 30:45.635
Retirement.
She thinks I should be retiring.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.847
I can't believe you're choosing now
to bring this up.

30:48.930 --> 30:51.099
Don't you think I got enough
to worry about with Jaden?

30:51.182 --> 30:52.684
Yeah, of course I do.

30:52.767 --> 30:56.688
Look, you and me have done things
the world is gonna remember.

30:56.771 --> 30:59.858
I've done them,
but you videotaped me doing them.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.568
You wanna throw that all away?

31:01.651 --> 31:05.321
No, Buck. I never said I want
to throw them away. I...

31:05.405 --> 31:07.448
This isn't really
that thought out of an idea.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.284
It was just something
she was pushing on me.

31:09.367 --> 31:11.327
I'm sorry, but I can't allow it.

31:11.411 --> 31:14.998
Your dream of watching TV all
day long is gonna have to wait.

31:15.081 --> 31:16.583
I need all hands on deck right now.

31:16.666 --> 31:18.543
Yeah. No. Of course you do.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.795
We're in the middle of it, so, yeah.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.381
Maybe we can agree
to discuss this at a later date.

31:23.464 --> 31:25.884
- How about that?
- Yeah. I don't know, Don.

31:26.634 --> 31:28.720
Maybe in a year or so.
But probably not.

31:29.721 --> 31:33.224
Sounds good. Just forget
I even said anything about it.

32:16.434 --> 32:19.020
Hey, look what I found.

32:23.691 --> 32:24.692
Keep moving.

32:35.536 --> 32:37.288
Be careful.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

32:37.372 --> 32:41.334
I'm not. I'm trained for this.
Greg set me up with parkour lessons.

32:41.417 --> 32:43.753
I thought you were taking karate.
We agreed on karate.

32:43.836 --> 32:45.546
It was too hard, so I quit.

32:46.756 --> 32:49.842
Well, it takes time
to learn something, son.

32:49.926 --> 32:52.428
You can't just go around
quitting stuff 'cause it's hard.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.055
That's not what Greg says.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.307
Greg says
if you don't like doing something,

32:56.391 --> 32:59.894
there ain't no reason to do it.
And it's totally cool to quit.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.606
Well, that's a terrible lesson.
No wonder you got held back.

33:03.690 --> 33:06.025
Greg says it was the teacher's fault.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.069
Greg's only telling you
what you wanna hear

33:08.152 --> 33:10.312
because he wants to suck up
and not hurt your feelings.

33:11.197 --> 33:13.700
Trust me when I tell you
that when you get a little older,

33:13.783 --> 33:16.369
you won't think gymnastics
are cool anymore.

33:16.452 --> 33:19.580
I told you, it's not gymnastics,
it's parkour--

33:25.169 --> 33:26.337
Oh, you're okay.

33:26.421 --> 33:29.841
No, I'm not. My leg's getting ready
to seize up on me.

33:29.924 --> 33:32.397
That's why I told you stop
playing around on the rocks. Get up.

33:32.427 --> 33:34.512
Let me catch my breath for a second.

33:34.595 --> 33:37.557
- Is your leg hurting or are you tired?
- Both. Dang.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.101
Okay,
we lost the whole morning already.

33:40.184 --> 33:43.813
- Daylight's burning here.
- But, Dad, my leg's fixing to die.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.691
Oh, you shit bird!

33:46.774 --> 33:47.859
You all right, Don?

33:50.069 --> 33:52.780
I slipped on this damn rock
and hit my darn head.

33:54.282 --> 33:57.076
Maybe it is a good
time to stop for lunch.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.287
Yeah, let's make camp.
Sounds like a good idea.

33:59.370 --> 34:02.081
Good,
'cause my blood sugar's running low.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.960
Oh, shit, am I bleeding?

34:12.592 --> 34:15.469
Hey, Jaden, where's your daddy?

34:15.553 --> 34:17.847
- Making sandwiches.
- You ain't hungry?

34:17.929 --> 34:21.476
I am hungry. But I'm gonna put
my hunger pangs into my music.

34:21.559 --> 34:24.437
Oh, uh-oh. What's wrong?

34:24.520 --> 34:26.409
I could tell you,
but you would never understand.

34:26.438 --> 34:29.650
Oh, you might be surprised
what old Don understands.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.777
You smoke?

34:32.652 --> 34:35.531
Hell, yeah, I do.
Don't tell your dad, though.

34:35.614 --> 34:37.533
Thinks it scares away the deer.

34:37.617 --> 34:38.618
Can I get a toke?

34:49.754 --> 34:51.005
There you go, Biggin.

34:51.714 --> 34:54.050
I wish my dad was
more chill like you.

34:54.132 --> 34:57.220
Your dad is definitely not the
easiest fella to get along with.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.806
He does put a lot of
pressure on himself.

34:59.889 --> 35:03.267
I think that's his drive
to become the world's best hunter.

35:04.227 --> 35:07.396
I can remember
the first video I made with your dad.

35:07.480 --> 35:11.526
We were up in Michigan, and I
was not prepared for the weather.

35:11.609 --> 35:16.155
That first day it had snowed ten inches
and I'd forgotten my waterproof boots.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.439
I turned to your dad and said,

35:17.490 --> 35:21.661
"Please, Buck, let's turn back. Let's
go home. Let's get out of here."

35:21.744 --> 35:23.246
But he wasn't hearing it.

35:23.871 --> 35:25.873
He sat me down. He was like,

35:25.957 --> 35:29.627
"Don, do you know what kind of
pressure I'm under? Do you?"

35:29.710 --> 35:31.003
Every single person thinks

35:31.087 --> 35:33.214
that Buck Ferguson gets his deer
every single time,

35:33.297 --> 35:35.299
"and I won't turn back until I do."

35:36.801 --> 35:39.470
- What'd you do?
- What do you think I did?

35:39.554 --> 35:40.471
Sucked it up.

35:40.555 --> 35:44.642
We stayed out there for another three
days and damn if your dad wasn't right.

35:45.476 --> 35:48.646
He caught himself a nice 12 pointer,

35:48.729 --> 35:51.357
and we made one of the best videos
we've ever made.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.817
What about your feet?

35:53.693 --> 35:55.736
I lost my big toe to frostbite.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.281
You lost a toe?

35:58.364 --> 35:59.866
Yes, I did. Yep.

35:59.949 --> 36:02.368
Got a little bit of a balance issue
because of it.

36:02.451 --> 36:04.287
That's not really the takeaway.

36:04.370 --> 36:08.332
The point of the story is
your dad is under a lot of pressure.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.668
You can understand
being under pressure, right?

36:11.377 --> 36:12.920
I guess.

36:18.301 --> 36:20.678
Don, why does my dad hate me?

36:21.596 --> 36:22.805
Hate you?

36:22.889 --> 36:25.016
Oh, come on. You don't believe that.

36:25.641 --> 36:29.020
Your dad is tough to get along with,
but he loves you.

36:29.687 --> 36:31.898
These last two years
have just been tough on him.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.317
That divorce
did a real number on his head.

36:35.193 --> 36:38.529
I think he believes this trip
is gonna somehow fix it.

36:38.613 --> 36:41.824
Well, I wish he'd care less
about me killing a deer

36:41.908 --> 36:44.785
and more about
giving me back my dang phone.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.537
Caroline's probably worried sick.

36:46.621 --> 36:47.872
I can relate to that.

36:47.955 --> 36:49.916
If I don't call Kimberly
every now and then,

36:49.999 --> 36:53.252
she definitely puts my ass
in the damn doghouse.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.673
I wish there was some way
I could let her know I'm okay.

36:57.757 --> 36:59.884
That's all I want for her right now.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.521
- You ready, buddy?
- I'm ready.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.523
- Are you filming? Is it rolling?
- Yeah.

37:55.606 --> 37:58.818
Here we go. Hoverboard city.

37:58.901 --> 38:01.195
- Don't be scared.
- I ain't scared.

38:01.279 --> 38:04.949
Just don't wanna break my neck.
Thanks for the ride, buddy!

38:05.032 --> 38:07.618
Oh!

38:11.497 --> 38:12.999
Whoo!

38:36.188 --> 38:40.067
Hey, Buck, what you doing?
What you up to?

38:40.151 --> 38:44.030
Just looking for the shortest course
to the top of this mountain.

38:44.113 --> 38:45.573
Oh, that's great.

38:45.656 --> 38:47.533
Lunch is gonna get cold.
Where's Jaden?

38:50.745 --> 38:53.664
Don, look at me.
Where's my son?

38:54.582 --> 38:57.752
He's, uh,
talking with his girlfriend.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.004
No, he's not. I took his phone away.

39:00.087 --> 39:01.881
I let him borrow mine. So he's...

39:02.673 --> 39:05.217
- You did what?
- I let him borrow my phone.

39:05.301 --> 39:07.815
It was the right thing to do.
He really wanted to speak with her.

39:07.845 --> 39:10.181
I took that away from him
so he'd focus on this trip.

39:10.264 --> 39:11.432
How could you do that?

39:11.515 --> 39:14.101
I guess I'm just a
believer in true love.

39:14.185 --> 39:17.730
He is really torn up about this girl
and I didn't think it was right--

39:17.813 --> 39:20.232
Don! Stop it! I'm his father.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.526
I know what's best for him,
and I'd take it kindly

39:22.610 --> 39:24.820
if you would
not undercut my authority again.

39:25.738 --> 39:26.572
Copy that.

39:26.655 --> 39:29.241
Nothing is going the
way it's supposed to.

39:29.325 --> 39:31.452
I cooked this nice meal.

39:31.535 --> 39:34.288
The whole thing's gonna go to waste,
just like this trip.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.416
And now,
I get to go be the bad guy again.

39:38.959 --> 39:40.169
Thanks a lot, Don.

39:44.799 --> 39:45.800
Jaden!

39:54.809 --> 39:55.851
Jaden!

39:57.019 --> 39:58.729
What did I tell you, son?

39:59.730 --> 40:03.192
No phone calls until after this trip
and you disobeyed me.

40:03.275 --> 40:05.611
What do you have to say for yourself?

40:06.362 --> 40:08.739
What do you have to say for yourself?

40:09.824 --> 40:11.575
Caroline broke up with me.

40:13.911 --> 40:14.995
What happened?

40:15.079 --> 40:17.581
She went to this middle school dance,

40:17.665 --> 40:21.252
which everyone knows
is a recipe for disaster.

40:21.335 --> 40:24.171
Now she says she doesn't want
to date someone in elementary school.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.340
That's ridiculous.
You two are the same age.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.466
That's what I told her.

40:29.593 --> 40:32.263
Well, are you doing okay?

40:32.346 --> 40:35.558
I'm fine. She's the one being stupid.

40:35.641 --> 40:38.727
She's being so dumb right now
I can barely stand it.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.398
I hate being in elementary school.

40:47.653 --> 40:48.946
Look, Jaden...

40:50.197 --> 40:53.659
I know you like this girl,
but let me tell you something.

40:53.742 --> 40:56.036
There is nothing wrong with you.

40:56.662 --> 40:58.998
If Caroline or whatever her name is

40:59.081 --> 41:02.376
can't appreciate you for who you are,
then she does not deserve you.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.545
Is that why you and
Mom got a divorce?

41:07.173 --> 41:10.509
Yeah. There were some other things.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.720
It started in '09.

41:13.387 --> 41:15.764
DVD sales were down slightly.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.725
Your mom was proving
through this whole thing

41:17.808 --> 41:19.435
to be a terribly selfish woman.

41:19.518 --> 41:22.813
She just had to give up
her lavish lifestyle,

41:22.897 --> 41:26.901
trips to the mall, that sort of
thing, and then she just went crazy.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.944
Just started acting out.

41:29.028 --> 41:32.281
Around that time,
Greg just kind of weaseled his way in

41:32.364 --> 41:35.159
and basically stole
my family out from me.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.953
It's funny hearing both sides.

41:38.913 --> 41:40.164
Why? How do you mean?

41:40.915 --> 41:43.501
Mom said that you were
always out hunting.

41:43.584 --> 41:46.212
And when you weren't hunting,
you'd sit around drinking.

41:46.295 --> 41:48.005
Kinda checked out, like.

41:48.923 --> 41:51.467
She said whenever she
tried to discuss it,

41:51.550 --> 41:54.720
you'd shut her down
and leave her no choice but to leave.

41:54.803 --> 41:56.222
She said that?

41:56.305 --> 42:00.351
She also said that it was
the hardest thing she ever had to do.

42:03.270 --> 42:04.855
You know why I love hunting?

42:05.814 --> 42:10.319
Because when you're out in these
woods, there's nothing to disturb you.

42:10.903 --> 42:15.324
Back home, the outside world has a
way of just barging in on your life

42:15.407 --> 42:17.493
and just screwing everything up.

42:17.576 --> 42:19.453
It makes a man feel powerless.

42:19.537 --> 42:24.416
But out here, all your cares
just kind of melt away.

42:26.126 --> 42:27.419
When you find a deer,

42:28.420 --> 42:31.590
and you bear down on that deer
with your rifle,

42:31.674 --> 42:35.344
and you fulfill your rightful place
in nature for one moment,

42:36.220 --> 42:38.305
that power is restored.

42:41.892 --> 42:44.061
Everything just falls into place.

42:47.022 --> 42:49.316
I could sure use
that right about now.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.610
Oh, your time is coming, son.

42:52.319 --> 42:54.989
When you take that monster buck
we've been tracking,

42:55.656 --> 42:58.200
everything will make sense,
I promise.

42:58.284 --> 42:59.702
I wish I didn't have to wait,

42:59.785 --> 43:02.705
'cause I'm carrying a lot of stress,
especially in my back.

43:04.790 --> 43:07.334

Whoa! Look at this.

Whoo!

44:36.757 --> 44:39.343
This rope bridge
will save us time for sure.

44:39.927 --> 44:41.887
Whoa! Look down there.

44:41.970 --> 44:43.847
- Here we go.
- There you go.

44:44.431 --> 44:45.766
I'll go first to test it.

44:46.392 --> 44:48.227
Just make myself feel better.

44:48.310 --> 44:50.270
- Long way down, Buck.
- Yeah.

44:50.354 --> 44:51.605
We good?

44:51.688 --> 44:53.774
- You got me?
- Yeah.

44:53.857 --> 44:56.527
- I'm on the edge of frame?
- Got you framed up.

44:57.236 --> 44:59.071
Look at that.

44:59.154 --> 45:00.948
Whoo! Here we go.

45:01.949 --> 45:02.949
All right.

45:07.037 --> 45:08.580
- You all right?
- You got it. Yeah.

45:08.664 --> 45:09.540
All right.

45:09.623 --> 45:11.500
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

45:14.336 --> 45:15.796
You know what I'm thinking, Don?

45:17.131 --> 45:20.634
You should cover this stuff
from the other side of the bridge.

45:21.635 --> 45:24.346
It's hard to see my face
shooting from here.

45:25.556 --> 45:28.183
- Uh, how am I supposed to get--
- No.

45:28.267 --> 45:29.530
You know what I'm talking about?

45:29.560 --> 45:32.062
Capturing the emotion
on my face better?

45:32.688 --> 45:34.148
Yeah, no, I understand.

45:34.231 --> 45:37.109
- You want me to cross the bridge first...
- Yeah.

45:37.192 --> 45:41.697
...so I get coverage of you testing out
the bridge before anybody crosses it,

45:42.281 --> 45:44.283
- because it's unsafe.
- Exactly.

45:44.366 --> 45:46.577
Be able to cover my face better.

45:46.660 --> 45:49.413
I do think a zoom would also be nice,
though--

45:49.496 --> 45:52.583
The zoom would be great
from the other side of the bridge.

45:52.666 --> 45:59.047
To do that but also to follow the push,
your back, see you hit the other side.

45:59.131 --> 46:02.426
From the other side, though, it would
be more the narrative simplicity.

46:03.010 --> 46:07.347
Zoom on me. You bring me in.
We sell a lot of videos.

46:08.682 --> 46:10.726
Yeah. Hey, number one.

46:11.310 --> 46:15.147
We're going for the best shots.
Best video we've ever made.

46:15.772 --> 46:17.232
- Here we go.
- All right.

46:17.316 --> 46:18.984
Lights, camera, action.

46:24.781 --> 46:26.033
Here you go.

46:30.913 --> 46:33.165
- Jesus Christ.
- You good? You ready?

46:33.248 --> 46:34.708
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Good.

46:34.791 --> 46:36.210
- It's a long way down.
- It is.

46:36.293 --> 46:37.628
It's gonna look great.

46:38.504 --> 46:41.590
Come on, buddy. There you go.
There you go!

46:43.300 --> 46:44.843
All right. All right.

46:44.927 --> 46:46.386
Holy shit.

46:46.470 --> 46:49.306
- It's a long way down. Watch your step.
- It is.

46:49.389 --> 46:51.350
You're looking good.
You're doing all right.

46:51.433 --> 46:52.518
- Okay.
- Doing good, Don.

46:52.601 --> 46:54.520
Okay. Got it.

46:55.187 --> 46:57.022
Oh, God damn it.

46:57.564 --> 46:58.774
Oh, my God.

46:58.857 --> 47:01.443
You look so funny.
You're cracking us up.

47:01.527 --> 47:03.904
Let's see how you look
when you get out here.

47:03.987 --> 47:06.198
Doing good, buddy.
You're doing good.

47:06.281 --> 47:08.242
- Don, you got this.
- Oh, my God.

47:09.243 --> 47:11.370
Holy shit. Oh!

47:11.954 --> 47:14.248
Shakier than a damn Studebaker.

47:15.290 --> 47:18.335
- Steady.
- You loving this, right?

47:18.418 --> 47:21.088
Buck, you're gonna have a blast
out here, you son of a bitch.

47:21.171 --> 47:22.506
Oh, my God.

47:22.589 --> 47:23.840
You're all right.

47:25.884 --> 47:27.761
- Okay, okay.
- You got it, buddy.

47:27.844 --> 47:28.971
Oh, Jesus Christ.

47:30.138 --> 47:31.306
Oh...

47:32.474 --> 47:35.143
- Oh, my Jesus H.
- He's moving good.

47:38.480 --> 47:40.691
- Oh, he made it! There we go.
- Whoo! Yeah!

47:40.774 --> 47:42.401
- Good job.
- Good job, Don.

47:42.484 --> 47:44.152
He did a good job. He focused.

47:45.153 --> 47:46.280
I did it!

47:46.822 --> 47:48.949
Nice job, Uncle Don. Nice job.

47:49.032 --> 47:51.368
I'm very grateful. You rolling?

47:52.286 --> 47:53.328
You were right!

47:53.412 --> 47:55.914
It is a pretty good angle.
We're rolling.

47:55.998 --> 47:57.791
All right.

48:00.502 --> 48:04.923
All right, son. Wait here while I test
the integrity of that rope bridge.

48:08.427 --> 48:11.138
Here we go.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.806
Whoo!

48:12.889 --> 48:14.641
All right, buddy, here we go.

48:21.356 --> 48:23.483
Whoa! It's a long way down.

48:23.567 --> 48:27.070
- It'll be all right! You got this!
- Oh, yeah.

48:28.405 --> 48:30.949
Looking good. Slow and steady, Buck.

48:31.658 --> 48:33.702
Oh, that's a long way down.

48:33.785 --> 48:36.705
Good thing no one else
has crossed that one before.

48:36.788 --> 48:38.457
Whoo!

48:38.540 --> 48:39.750
Oh, yeah.

48:41.668 --> 48:43.211
Oh, this is exhilarating!

48:44.004 --> 48:45.172
Show off.

48:45.255 --> 48:46.965
I'm coming for you, non-typical!

48:47.049 --> 48:48.550
There you go!

48:51.303 --> 48:53.347
- Success!
- Here you are.

48:57.100 --> 48:58.352
That was awesome.

49:02.022 --> 49:03.273
What's he doing?

49:07.110 --> 49:09.363
Check it out. Zip line!

49:09.446 --> 49:13.408
Jaden Ferguson, put that belt back on
right now and cross it normal.

49:13.492 --> 49:15.827
That is a direct order. Over.

49:15.911 --> 49:18.080
This is gonna be a rush.

49:18.163 --> 49:19.498
Jaden, no!

49:19.581 --> 49:20.707
No, no, no!

49:21.958 --> 49:23.168
Oh, shit.

49:23.877 --> 49:24.877
Oh!

49:25.712 --> 49:28.423
Come on.
Keep going. Keep going.

49:28.507 --> 49:30.676
Come on. Come on. Come on.

49:34.054 --> 49:35.764
- Help!
- God dang it.

49:35.847 --> 49:38.308
- Oh, Jesus.
- Dad! Help me!

49:38.392 --> 49:40.519
Hold on, son! Don't let go!

49:40.602 --> 49:42.437
- Help!
- I'm coming!

49:42.521 --> 49:43.897
Dad! Help!

49:43.980 --> 49:45.857
Hold on! Hold on, Jaden.

49:45.941 --> 49:47.651
- I'm slipping!
- I'm coming!

49:47.734 --> 49:49.653
- Please, Dad!
- Hold on.

49:49.736 --> 49:51.905
Please help!

49:51.988 --> 49:53.824
- Dad, I'm slipping!
- Hold on!

49:53.907 --> 49:55.367
- I'm slipping!
- Son, hold on tight!

49:55.450 --> 49:56.993
- Hold on!
- Hold on, Jaden!

49:58.745 --> 50:00.956
No! No! No! Don't let go!

50:01.581 --> 50:02.581
Almost there.

50:03.458 --> 50:05.252
- Help! Hurry!
- Almost there!

50:05.752 --> 50:06.878
Oh, shit!

50:11.174 --> 50:14.594
I got you, son. I got you.

50:14.678 --> 50:15.804
Oh...

50:18.181 --> 50:22.102
Oh, what a stupid-ass idea.

50:29.526 --> 50:31.319
I'm just glad you're safe.

50:31.403 --> 50:33.071
Do you know how much you mean to me?

50:33.864 --> 50:39.369
I'm not even mad that you did
something so dumb and so stupid.

50:40.162 --> 50:41.288
Thanks, Dad.

50:41.913 --> 50:46.334
Plus, you gotta admit, it's pretty nice
just to chill here for a little bit.

50:46.418 --> 50:48.128
Are you still reading this article?

50:48.211 --> 50:49.296
- No.
- No.

50:50.380 --> 50:54.092
- But I was still looking at the pictures.
- Oh, sorry.

50:56.219 --> 50:58.764
It's nice we got this time to talk.

50:59.431 --> 51:03.351
I want to tell you that I know
you're going through a lot of stuff

51:03.435 --> 51:05.520
and dealing with the divorce.

51:05.604 --> 51:08.565
And now Greg's moved in and he's
talking about marrying your mom.

51:08.648 --> 51:10.317
It's gotta be feeling weird.

51:10.400 --> 51:13.153
Yeah. Mom was saying the same thing.

51:13.737 --> 51:16.907
The other night, Mom and Greg
sat me down at the table

51:16.990 --> 51:19.159
and said if they ever get married,

51:19.242 --> 51:20.952
I might feel weird what to call Greg.

51:21.036 --> 51:23.622
She said I can either
choose to call him Greg

51:23.705 --> 51:25.832
or I can choose to call him Dad.

51:25.916 --> 51:28.376
- Uh-huh. What'd you say?
- I said I didn't want to do it.

51:28.460 --> 51:31.421
- I thought it was strange.
- It's very strange.

51:31.505 --> 51:34.424
- Good for you, son.
- Then you know what?

51:34.508 --> 51:36.635
I tried it and it wasn't that bad.

51:37.969 --> 51:40.931
What? You called Greg "Dad"?

51:41.014 --> 51:42.766
Yeah, but only, like, five times.

51:42.849 --> 51:46.853
I figured that if they ever get married,
I might just switch back and forth.

51:47.521 --> 51:49.397
How could you do that, Jaden?

51:49.481 --> 51:51.316
What's the big deal?
It doesn't mean anything.

51:51.399 --> 51:53.527
Yes, it does, Jaden. It means a lot.

51:53.610 --> 51:55.070
Where are you going?

51:55.737 --> 51:57.239
I'm gonna look for that deer.

52:07.582 --> 52:10.919
- Where are you going?
- Gonna go track that non-typical.

52:11.002 --> 52:12.921
- You all right, buddy?
- I'm fine.

52:13.004 --> 52:16.132
We don't find that non-typical,
Jaden's never gonna shoot a deer,

52:16.216 --> 52:17.968
and this whole trip will be a bust.

52:18.051 --> 52:19.469
You want me to come with?

52:19.553 --> 52:22.097
No. You stay with Jaden.
I want to be alone.

52:23.181 --> 52:24.391
Sure, Buck.

52:46.830 --> 52:48.290
Jaden? How you doing, sweetie?

52:49.124 --> 52:50.917
No, it's not Jaden. It's Buck.

52:51.001 --> 52:53.378
Buck? I can barely hear you.

52:53.461 --> 52:55.130
Is Jaden okay?

52:55.213 --> 52:58.842
Oh, Jaden's fine. Everybody's fine.
That's not why I'm calling.

52:58.925 --> 53:01.636
Buck, have you been drinking?

53:01.720 --> 53:04.598
A little. I'm not drunk.

53:04.681 --> 53:07.058
We talked about you calling
when you're drunk.

53:07.142 --> 53:10.103
That's not important.
I got a bone to pick with you.

53:10.186 --> 53:14.900
What's this I hear about you telling
Jaden that he can call Greg "Dad," huh?

53:15.650 --> 53:19.446
Look, let me just say,
that is never gonna happen, Linda.

53:19.529 --> 53:22.866
We may not be a family,
but I'm still the boy's father.

53:22.949 --> 53:24.200
I have a say in this,

53:24.284 --> 53:29.998
and there is no way I'm ever gonna
let my son call another man "Dad."

53:30.081 --> 53:32.792
Okay? Not now, not ever.

53:32.876 --> 53:36.546
- I have to go, Buck.
- No, wait, Linda! Linda, wait.

53:38.548 --> 53:39.549
Linda...

53:40.842 --> 53:43.053
Are you really going
to marry this guy?

53:44.137 --> 53:45.889
- Huh?
- I have to go, Buck.

53:45.972 --> 53:48.058
Linda? Hello?

53:50.143 --> 53:51.311
Linda!

53:52.771 --> 53:55.315
Damn! Shit.

54:15.335 --> 54:17.379
I hate the new Camaro. It's ugly.

54:18.213 --> 54:21.925
I bet you get a lot of pretty girls
wanting to get a ride in that, though.

54:22.008 --> 54:24.010
Girls don't know crap about cars.

54:24.094 --> 54:26.888
My ex thought a Honda Accord
was a good car.

54:27.514 --> 54:29.641
My girlfriend knows more about cars
than I do.

54:29.724 --> 54:32.644
She's a certified mechanic
and a registered nurse.

54:32.727 --> 54:34.437
- That's pretty cool.
- It is cool.

54:34.536 --> 54:37.494
First time I met her, she's like, "I'm a
certified mechanic and registered nurse."

54:37.524 --> 54:40.944
I'm like, "Yeah? I got a busted truck
and a heart condition."

54:41.027 --> 54:43.827
Then she looks at me and she's like,
"We're gonna get along just fine."

54:45.198 --> 54:47.826
She's quick.
She's a very funny woman.

54:47.909 --> 54:49.786
Have I showed you photos of Kimberly?

54:49.869 --> 54:50.996
You showed me some.

54:56.835 --> 54:58.395
Bet I didn't show you
that picture, huh?

55:00.171 --> 55:01.171
Whoa!

55:01.214 --> 55:04.467
Look at that. These ain't the
pictures I showed you. Look out.

55:06.302 --> 55:07.595
Who are all these black dudes?

55:07.679 --> 55:11.391
That's just her thing. She's just
into black fellas. She's wild.

55:11.474 --> 55:14.728
Let me tell you what,
look how many of 'em I got.

55:14.811 --> 55:17.022
These guys are
high-fiving each other.

55:17.105 --> 55:20.191
This guy is Phillip.
He's our insurance adjuster.

55:20.275 --> 55:21.818
These were before y'all went out?

55:21.901 --> 55:23.445
Oh, no, sir, these are recent.

55:23.528 --> 55:27.323
Yeah, no, I took these photos.
Look at this one here. See?

55:27.407 --> 55:29.034
That's my foot in that photograph.

55:29.117 --> 55:31.411
- What on God's green Earth?
- Hey, Buck.

55:32.078 --> 55:33.371
What are y'all looking at?

55:34.205 --> 55:37.834
Uh, these, nothing, just the...
These are the photos of Kimberly.

55:37.917 --> 55:40.128
You know the ones.
You've seen them. Look out.

55:40.211 --> 55:41.963
I know what photos
you're talking about.

55:42.047 --> 55:44.340
- Leave, Don, right now!
- Of course.

55:44.424 --> 55:47.469
- Please and thank you.
- All right. See you, Jaden.

55:49.888 --> 55:52.640
You tell me what was happening,
Jaden Ferguson.

55:52.724 --> 55:54.654
He was just showing me
pictures of his girlfriend.

55:54.684 --> 55:58.146
Those are adult images
you have no business looking at.

55:58.229 --> 56:00.857
I thought you brought me on this trip
because I'm mature now.

56:00.940 --> 56:02.901
Why do you keep treating me
like a dumbass kid?

56:02.984 --> 56:06.738
'Cause you are a kid when it comes to
nudeness and sexual relationships!

56:06.821 --> 56:09.282
He knows better than
to show you that.

56:09.365 --> 56:12.410
What's the big deal? Greg has
worse pictures than that at home.

56:12.994 --> 56:14.788
- Mellow out!
- He...

56:15.914 --> 56:18.208
Oh, that dirty son of a bitch!

56:18.291 --> 56:20.752
Goddamn Greg. Goddamn Greg!

56:22.003 --> 56:24.005
Okay. Buck, that was on me, okay?

56:24.089 --> 56:26.382
Don't get mad at Jaden.
We were talking about girls--

56:26.466 --> 56:27.634
I don't wanna hear it.

56:27.717 --> 56:30.553
Jaden doesn't need to
be shown that junk. Okay?

56:30.637 --> 56:33.681
- No discussion, case closed!
- Okay, you're right.

56:33.765 --> 56:36.392
I don't want you to teach my son
not to respect women.

56:36.476 --> 56:40.146
You've known me for 25 years.
I respect women.

56:40.230 --> 56:41.564
You're the only person I know

56:41.648 --> 56:44.359
that thinks letting his lady
do an orgy is respectful.

56:44.442 --> 56:48.071
Buck, I was just trying to
speak with him like a grown-up.

56:48.154 --> 56:50.448
He's not a grown-up, Don! He's 12.

56:50.532 --> 56:54.702
Even a grown person doesn't need to be
exposed to your sexual peccadilloes.

56:54.786 --> 56:56.538
- My sexual what?
- Peccadilloes!

56:56.621 --> 56:58.873
- Peccadilloes?
- Yeah.

57:00.625 --> 57:02.669
What are you saying? I'm nasty?

57:03.461 --> 57:06.506
Okay, I guess I'm nasty.
Fine, I guess.

57:06.589 --> 57:09.759
Damn right. You think it's a
normal thing to show people?

57:09.843 --> 57:12.053
Black guys pulling a train
on your girlfriend?

57:12.137 --> 57:15.765
What the F, Buck?
You have crossed the line this time.

57:15.849 --> 57:16.724
Oh, have I?

57:16.808 --> 57:19.269
You wanna know the real reason
I'm retiring?

57:19.352 --> 57:22.147
Oh, please, don't tell me about
your stupid dream of watching TV.

57:22.230 --> 57:24.357
No, it has nothing
to do with television.

57:24.441 --> 57:26.693
The real reason is
because you're an asshole,

57:26.776 --> 57:31.114
and I'm sick of traipsing around
these forests for nothing!

57:31.197 --> 57:33.283
To lose a goddamn big toe,
that's all.

57:33.366 --> 57:36.703
You don't care about anybody,
you don't give a shit about me,

57:36.786 --> 57:40.457
and you never gave a shit about Jaden
until his mom left you.

57:40.540 --> 57:42.792
You can talk all the nonsense

57:42.876 --> 57:45.920
and Billy Bob bullshit you want
about me and Kimberly's relationship,

57:46.004 --> 57:49.090
but the bottom line is,
at least I got somebody.

57:49.174 --> 57:50.654
At least I'm not alone in this world.

57:53.261 --> 57:56.097
Goddamn. Fuck.

57:58.224 --> 57:59.726
You broke my nose.

57:59.809 --> 58:02.729
You damned broke my nose and
smashed it to the side of my face.

58:02.812 --> 58:06.858
- Is it broken?
- Get your hands off me! I'm done.

58:06.941 --> 58:10.278
That's it. I'm sick and
tired of the mistreatment,

58:10.361 --> 58:15.408
disrespect and condescension.
I'm not dealing with it anymore.

58:15.492 --> 58:20.330
You know what? You can take this hunting
video and stick it up inside your asshole.

58:21.247 --> 58:24.334
Good luck taking that gear
out of here by yourself!

58:24.417 --> 58:27.462
Twenty miles from the nearest road?
Good luck.

58:28.296 --> 58:32.425
Cars, cars and more cars.

58:32.509 --> 58:34.928
Crowds, pollution, global warming.

58:35.011 --> 58:38.556
These are all things
our modern civilization creates.

58:38.640 --> 58:41.893
Cities full of people caught up in
the hustle and bustle of the rat race.

58:42.810 --> 58:46.523
As you can probably tell,
I'm not a big fan of city life.

58:46.606 --> 58:50.485
I much prefer the joy and solitude
of good old Mother Nature.

58:51.236 --> 58:53.363
Not that it would be
all smiles and meditation.

58:53.446 --> 58:57.242
Scaling this mountain is gonna take
a lot of old-fashioned elbow grease.

58:57.325 --> 59:00.995
But I have faith that God is watching
and he will reward our hard work.

59:01.079 --> 59:03.206
And if it be his will,

59:03.289 --> 59:06.584
Jaden and I will find that old
whitetail we've been looking for.

59:30.733 --> 59:33.027
If my calculations are correct,

59:33.111 --> 59:35.989
our non-typical is on the other side
of this hill.

59:36.072 --> 59:38.157
What if we get there
and don't find anything?

59:38.241 --> 59:39.659
It will be there,

59:39.742 --> 59:41.464
but if we're gonna make it,
we can't be negative.

59:41.494 --> 59:43.705
It'll be a hard climb.
You wanna get that deer,

59:43.788 --> 59:44.788
this is what we gotta do.

59:45.415 --> 59:49.460
I gotta say, this deer really isn't
a top priority for me anymore.

59:49.544 --> 59:51.754
Basically, I'm good
if we don't kill the deer.

59:51.838 --> 59:54.882
Ain't like it's gonna affect my life
in some significant way.

59:54.966 --> 59:56.676
Of course it will.

59:56.759 --> 59:59.053
The reason we're out here
is so you can shoot a deer.

59:59.137 --> 01:00:01.264
How else are you gonna love hunting,
huh?

01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:03.474
Oh, we're way past me loving hunting.

01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:05.518
Why don't you go up there
and kill the deer,

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.104
- and I'll chill here?
- You listen to me.

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:10.607
We are gonna finish this thing, okay?

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:13.651
I don't care if I have to drag you
up this mountain myself.

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:16.404
- Come on.
- Please kill me now.

01:00:16.487 --> 01:00:18.656

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:46.763
Jaden, get your rifle ready. Come on.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:49.974
Come on.

01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:56.189
I'll get to finish this video
after all.

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:59.150
Don took the Sony,
but this little deal is full 1080p,

01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:00.651
and will work in a pinch.

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:03.070
Oh, you look good in HD, Jaden.

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:09.494
My Lord, that is one gorgeous
non-typical whitetail.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:14.582
Right. This is the moment we've been
waiting for, son. Are you ready?

01:03:14.665 --> 01:03:16.334
Oh, hell, yeah.

01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:18.669
Now, remember,
control your breathing.

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:26.344
All right, when you're ready...

01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:28.513
take the shot.

01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:45.112
What's the matter?
Is your gun jammed?

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:49.033
I'm gonna wait for it to turn around,
get a cleaner shot that way.

01:03:49.116 --> 01:03:50.436
Oh, no, don't wait. Take him now.

01:03:50.503 --> 01:03:53.381
I don't wanna injure him.
Isn't that what you always say?

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:56.215
Go ahead and injure him. He'll
have plenty of time to bleed out

01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:58.084
while we go down there and get him.

01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:00.002
Trust me. Just take the
damn shot already.

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:01.254
Okay, okay, relax.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:09.679
Take the shot. Take the shot.

01:04:13.432 --> 01:04:16.310
What are you looking at me for?
Look at the deer!

01:04:20.106 --> 01:04:22.817
Take the shot.
Come on, there you go.

01:04:24.318 --> 01:04:25.318
Take the shot!

01:04:25.736 --> 01:04:28.531
Oh! No, he's running. Get him!

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:32.034
He's running! Right over there!
Get him! Shoot, Jaden!

01:04:34.996 --> 01:04:38.207
Shit, it's Don! What the hell?
You shot Don!

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:40.376
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, no.

01:04:41.085 --> 01:04:43.337
I gotta go out there and help him.

01:04:44.338 --> 01:04:46.716
Jaden, no! No!

01:04:56.017 --> 01:04:58.436
- Oh, I got popped in the leg.
- Don?

01:05:00.062 --> 01:05:02.565
Oh, Buck. Buck, is that you?

01:05:03.941 --> 01:05:05.610
- I'm not doing good.
- I see you, buddy.

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:06.777
Hey, Jaden.

01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:08.154
Here we are, Don.

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:09.822
Put your head up a little bit.

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:13.492
- Here we are, buddy.
- Oh, it's bad. It's bad.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.202
I'll make a tourniquet.
Hang in there.

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:17.496
You're a good shot, Jaden.
You got me good.

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.959
Hang in there.
What the hell were you doing up here?

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:24.170
I couldn't leave
till we finished that video.

01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:27.465
Besides, who else knows
which angles make you look younger?

01:05:27.548 --> 01:05:30.843
Ow! That's too tight!
Put your finger inside of it.

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:33.220
We gotta stop the bleeding
so we can get you out of here.

01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:35.598
Put your finger on
to make the wound stop mashing.

01:05:35.681 --> 01:05:36.766
Hang in there.

01:05:37.975 --> 01:05:40.978
Don? Don. Come on, stay with me, Don.

01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:42.855
Stay with me. Come on, buddy.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.398
Is he dead?

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:47.818
Hey, Mom, you got
that pretty dress on.

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:50.738
We gotta get him out of here.
Come on.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:53.699
- Ready? Bring him up.
- Yeah.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.576
There you go.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.328
Don, ready? One, two, three.

01:06:02.124 --> 01:06:04.126

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:57.513
- Put me down.
- All right. Get him down.

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:08.482
Good night, my special son.

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:20.077
We're never gonna get Don
out of these mountains.

01:07:27.084 --> 01:07:30.671
Sorry, Dad. Sorry for shooting Don.

01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:32.965
Oh, Jaden, it's not your fault.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:36.218
Yes, it is. I can't do anything
without messing it up.

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:39.597
I failed at hunting
just like I failed at school.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:43.184
I don't need an extra year to grow
and I'm not a visual learner.

01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:46.645
What you all talking about?
I'm bleeding... bleeding out.

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:48.355
This just proves it.

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:50.733
I'm just not smart.

01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:53.527
I'm stupid, Dad.

01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:57.114
Don't you ever
talk about yourself like that.

01:07:57.198 --> 01:08:00.242
I don't ever wanna hear those words
come out of your mouth again.

01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:01.202
Yes, sir.

01:08:01.285 --> 01:08:02.912
Y'all just keep talking,
I'm bleeding.

01:08:02.995 --> 01:08:05.081
If there's anybody stupid here,
it's me.

01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:07.249
We should've turned
back a long time ago.

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:10.586
I wanted you to kill
that non-typical so bad,

01:08:10.669 --> 01:08:12.713
I didn't care what I had to do.

01:08:15.716 --> 01:08:17.760
I thought if you loved hunting,

01:08:17.843 --> 01:08:19.929
it could be something
we could do together,

01:08:20.845 --> 01:08:25.600
'cause I'm not living with you anymore
and I don't get to see you that much.

01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:31.023
I was just hoping
there would be a way that...

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:32.983
I could always be in your life.

01:08:34.693 --> 01:08:37.404
But you don't need a reason
to be in my life.

01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:39.198
You're my father.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:46.455
What y'all doing over there?
Having a sandwich?

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:48.124
I don't know what to do.

01:08:49.082 --> 01:08:53.212
Can't carry him out of here. Need
a helicopter or a damn stretcher.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:55.923
How about an air mattress?

01:08:58.676 --> 01:08:59.844
Jaden...

01:08:59.926 --> 01:09:01.345
You, son...

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:03.389
are a damn genius.

01:09:04.932 --> 01:09:06.015
Come on.

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:28.538
- Oh, there we go.
- Buck.

01:09:30.957 --> 01:09:32.292
Hey.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:36.755
We got you.

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:38.966
Gonna hop on there,
we start downstream.

01:09:39.049 --> 01:09:41.594
It's gonna be rough as hell. Okay?

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:44.305
Hold on to him and stay on
this mattress best you can.

01:09:44.388 --> 01:09:46.140
- You understand?
- Don't worry, I got it.

01:09:46.223 --> 01:09:48.142
You doing all right there, Don?

01:09:51.103 --> 01:09:52.688
Good enough. Ready, son?

01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:53.814
I was born ready.

01:09:53.898 --> 01:09:55.983
All right. Don't get wet.

01:09:58.319 --> 01:09:59.653
Let's go.

01:09:59.737 --> 01:10:02.156
Oh, waterbed.

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:08.454
Oh, hell, yeah.

01:10:29.975 --> 01:10:32.019
Watch out. Paddle, paddle, paddle.

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:37.399
These rapids aren't so bad,
maybe class two.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:39.610
They're bad enough. Just be careful.

01:10:39.693 --> 01:10:41.654
I've seen bigger waves
in a toilet bowl.

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:46.867
Jaden, Jaden, Jaden, hold on. Yeah!

01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:48.744
- Whoo!
- Oh.

01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:50.079
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:54.541
There we go. Hold on to the rope.
Hold on to the rope.

01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:58.921
Now, these look like class three.

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:01.674
Whoo! Yeah!

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:04.969
Making me faint.

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:10.516
What's happening?

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:14.061
You ready? Well, come on, let's go.

01:11:18.399 --> 01:11:19.608
Hold on to the rope!

01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:23.153
Doing good, son. Hold on tight!

01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:29.493
Hold on for a little bit longer!

01:11:35.749 --> 01:11:37.418
- Brutal!
- Hold on!

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:46.260
We did good, son. We did good.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:56.312
You're all right. You're all right.

01:11:57.521 --> 01:12:00.232
- Are you okay, Don?
- Yeah, I feel good.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.653
I really appreciate
this valiant effort to save me.

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:09.575
Oh, this sounds like a biggie.

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:22.838
- All right, come on, paddle, paddle.
- Let's just go to the shore.

01:12:22.921 --> 01:12:25.090
We can do this, son.
Here we go.

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:27.676
- Oh, my God, here's the big one!
- Oh, Jesus.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.762
Here we go!
Hang on, Jaden!

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:38.603
Hold on to the rope!

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.363
Hold on!

01:12:59.249 --> 01:13:01.835
- My rifle!
- No, Jaden!

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:03.045
Jaden, no!

01:13:03.128 --> 01:13:04.588
Dad!

01:13:09.927 --> 01:13:11.887
- Dad!
- Jaden!

01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:14.723
- Dad! Dad!
- Jaden!

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:20.896
Hold on, son!

01:13:23.273 --> 01:13:25.067
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:29.113
I got you. Hold on. I got you.

01:13:29.196 --> 01:13:30.656
But my rifle.

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:34.034
Let it go, son. Let it go.

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:33.635
Dad. I wanna play you
a song I've been working on.

01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:36.305
I'd love to hear it.
You wrote a song?

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:38.807

totally bored?

No, sir.
I want you to take this four-wheeler,

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:50.439
drive Don to Cherokee Mountain
Outfitters and get him an ambulance,

- but under one condition.
- What?

01:16:53.191 --> 01:16:55.360

my best driving, anyway.
