WEBVTT

00:03.752 --> 00:07.547
Elliot, stop giving me your "you're
totally gonna mess up" stare.

00:07.548 --> 00:11.142
You stop making your "I'm
totally gonna mess up" face.

00:13.059 --> 00:17.166
Do you know how important this is?
Logan Rawlings is comming to dinner.

00:17.167 --> 00:18.935
We are talking about the editor of...

00:18.936 --> 00:20.352
- San Francisco Monthly...
- San Francisco Monthly,

00:20.353 --> 00:22.892
she decides who will be on
the "Thirty Under Thirty" list.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.734
We know, Elliot, you talk more about this,

00:25.735 --> 00:28.179
than about your dreamday
with Anderson Cooper.

00:29.718 --> 00:32.852
And if Josh doesn't get on
the list, he'll be devastated!

00:32.984 --> 00:35.202
He's twenty-nine, this is his last shot.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.138
Imagine the pressure he's under.

00:37.189 --> 00:40.141
Elliot, why don't you be a
little less crouching tiger,

00:40.192 --> 00:42.193
and a little more hidden dragon?

00:44.313 --> 00:46.397
What's going on?

00:46.399 --> 00:49.150
Hey, Josh, everything's under control.

00:49.201 --> 00:51.202
Okay, good. Because do you
know how important this is?

00:51.277 --> 00:54.054
- Logan Rawlings...
- We know! We know!

00:55.459 --> 00:58.619
Do you also know how devastated Elliot
will be if I don't get on this list?

00:59.454 --> 01:02.088
I'm twenty-nine, he's my
publicist. This is his last shot.

01:02.902 --> 01:04.257
Can you imagine the pressure he's under?

01:04.596 --> 01:06.696
Yeah, I live paycheck to paycheck.

01:06.730 --> 01:08.598
I know a thing or two about pressure.

01:09.766 --> 01:11.651
Will you let her finish cooking?

01:11.685 --> 01:12.685
She's here!

01:16.690 --> 01:20.493
Hi, I'm Logan. And I'm not in
the mood to explain my tattoos.

01:22.112 --> 01:25.481
I'm Yolanda. And I'm not in
the mood to show you mine.

01:28.118 --> 01:33.323
Elliot Park. An honor to meet San
Francisco's legendary taste-maker.

01:33.325 --> 01:35.325
Aw, I hate kiss-asses.

01:36.493 --> 01:39.495
Almost as much as I love them. Two times.

01:42.216 --> 01:44.467
Wow. Look at this place.

01:44.501 --> 01:49.255
Painting, love. View, love.

01:49.306 --> 01:51.341
Pillow, hate.

01:55.479 --> 01:58.481
That's why they call it a throw pillow.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.435
Can I interest you in
a Cinnamon Toast-Tini

02:02.519 --> 02:04.354
with actual crushed-up Cinnamon Toast?

02:04.356 --> 02:07.190
Doubtful.

02:07.192 --> 02:10.425
Mmmm. I want a recipe, a photo and another.

02:11.445 --> 02:13.196
And here's the man of the hour!

02:13.247 --> 02:16.366
Good evening, Logan.
Welcome to Casa Kaminski.

02:18.202 --> 02:19.202
Cheers.

02:20.287 --> 02:22.205
Wow. Impressive.

02:22.256 --> 02:23.506
Yep. That coulda gone either way.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.291
Glad it went the good way.

02:25.342 --> 02:28.094
You know, I have to say, you're
the most handsome tech guy

02:28.128 --> 02:29.178
I've interviewed for my list.

02:29.213 --> 02:31.264
Oh, well, I have to say,

02:31.298 --> 02:34.183
can you repeat that into my phone
so I can use it as a ringtone?

02:38.389 --> 02:40.273
May I escort you to the terrace?

02:42.226 --> 02:44.227
Oh, what's this?

02:44.278 --> 02:47.313
Oh. Well, you know how at Costco
they have all those free samples?

02:47.364 --> 02:52.285
- I don't.
- Well, they do.

02:52.319 --> 02:54.237
And I call 'em "Stor'd'Oeuvres."

02:54.288 --> 02:57.206
If you take enough of
them, they make a full meal.

02:57.241 --> 02:59.325
And yet when I take
'em, they call security.

03:01.412 --> 03:04.047
Well, I thought in honor of
your "Thirty Under Thirty" list,

03:04.081 --> 03:07.166
I made thirty different perfect
samples of San Francisco cuisine.

03:07.217 --> 03:08.418
Get it?

03:08.469 --> 03:11.254
Yeah, I went to Harvard.

03:11.256 --> 03:14.090
I have a sweatshirt from there.

03:14.124 --> 03:17.260
Your parents must be so proud.

03:17.262 --> 03:18.261
Get out!

03:18.312 --> 03:21.147
So, tell me,

03:21.181 --> 03:25.268
how does a tall, handsome Internet
mogul with great hair get his start?

03:25.270 --> 03:27.270
Oh, the way we all do.

03:27.321 --> 03:30.106
You get shoved into a
locker by a football player.

03:44.383 --> 03:46.422
Oh! Dinner was superb.

03:46.457 --> 03:49.396
That last spoon of Salted
Caramel Creme Brulee

03:49.397 --> 03:51.280
was so rich it should have a Trophy Wife.

03:53.263 --> 03:55.098
Well, I'm sorry you have to skedaddle.

03:55.132 --> 03:56.466
And that I said, "skedaddle".

03:57.551 --> 03:59.469
Why don't I walk you out?

03:59.471 --> 04:01.354
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

04:04.058 --> 04:06.142
So, what do you think of my boy?

04:06.193 --> 04:08.444
Look, I don't
post my list until Friday,

04:08.479 --> 04:10.313
but I wouldn't worry
about it if I were you.

04:10.364 --> 04:12.482
- You wouldn't?
- No. He's not on it.

04:12.484 --> 04:17.320
But... what... you... but... why?!

04:17.322 --> 04:19.372
There's a lot of great candidates.

04:19.406 --> 04:21.156
This is San Francisco.

04:21.190 --> 04:23.159
You're not the only stuck-up
publicist I'm dealing with.

04:23.161 --> 04:28.047
No, no! There's got to
be something I can do.

04:28.082 --> 04:29.499
- Anything!
- Uh, nothing.

04:29.501 --> 04:31.250
I mean, unless you could get me a date.

04:31.301 --> 04:37.206
Oh, believe me, no one knows the pain
of not having Josh more than I do.

04:37.241 --> 04:39.342
But, unfortunately, he's engaged.

04:39.393 --> 04:43.262
- Not Josh.
- Well, I'm flattered, Logan,

04:43.313 --> 04:44.514
- but I'm not really...
- Not you.

04:46.233 --> 04:47.483
That cute little blonde.

04:51.355 --> 04:55.358
Gabi? With the pots and pans?

04:55.409 --> 04:58.161
And the cute dimples and great legs.

04:59.246 --> 05:01.330
Any chance she's single and gay?

05:01.365 --> 05:04.250
Uh, she's definitely single.

05:06.036 --> 05:09.422
And now that I think about it,
she doesn't have a girlfriend.

05:11.208 --> 05:13.459
- You don't say?
- Oh, I say.

05:13.510 --> 05:17.013
I say because it's true.

05:19.049 --> 05:22.051
You put Josh on your
"Thirty Under Thirty" list

05:22.102 --> 05:25.388
and I'll put Gabi on
your "Girl-Under-Girl list.

05:28.392 --> 05:31.227
Deal.

05:31.278 --> 05:34.397
Crushed it! List made.

05:34.399 --> 05:36.115
What's the good news, my man?

05:36.200 --> 05:39.368
Logan found someone in
this room very impressive.

05:39.403 --> 05:41.287
Yes!

05:41.321 --> 05:43.406
Thirty Under Thirty!

05:43.408 --> 05:45.158
I'm gonna go call Caroline
and tell her the good news.

05:45.209 --> 05:48.411
You do that! Go you! Whoo-hoo!

05:48.462 --> 05:51.164
- We have a situation.
- We do?

05:51.215 --> 05:55.084
Josh is not the shoo-in he thinks
he is. The competition is very stiff.

05:55.086 --> 05:57.286
Oh! Why does the competition
always have to be stiff?

05:57.321 --> 05:59.055
- Why can't it be limp and...
- Zip it!

05:59.089 --> 06:01.090
- Sorry!
- Here's the deal.

06:01.141 --> 06:05.094
I made arrangements for you to take
Logan out to drinks and talk Josh up.

06:05.096 --> 06:07.096
Me? Why me?

06:07.147 --> 06:12.443
For reasons I cannot explain,
Logan has taken a liking to you.

06:12.445 --> 06:15.112
Maybe it's your cooking, your style.

06:15.164 --> 06:18.416
Or the fact that you're a
woman and she wants a woman...

06:18.450 --> 06:21.319
...'s point of view.

06:21.353 --> 06:24.222
How cool is that! Okay, I'm in.

06:24.256 --> 06:26.174
For free drinks, I'd even talk you up.

06:28.460 --> 06:30.461
Just don't forget to flatter her.

06:30.463 --> 06:32.296
Oh, you got it.

06:32.347 --> 06:35.132
For Josh, I will charm the pants off her.

06:35.134 --> 06:37.134
That is what I'm hoping.

06:42.510 --> 06:44.627
God, you smell good. What is it?

06:44.629 --> 06:46.679
Oh, it's the September Issue of Vogue.

06:46.714 --> 06:48.598
I just put it on the floor and rollroun it.

06:50.384 --> 06:52.435
A natural blonde and a sense of humor?

06:52.469 --> 06:53.803
You're a dream.

06:53.837 --> 06:55.388
I'm so glad you wanted to go out.

06:55.439 --> 06:56.806
Are you kidding? I'm so flattered.

06:56.857 --> 06:59.342
You're the most successful
woman I've ever been out with.

06:59.376 --> 07:01.394
Look, I hope you're not intimidated by me.

07:01.445 --> 07:03.396
I just want you to be
able to tell me anything.

07:03.447 --> 07:06.316
Let me just start off by
saying Josh is amazing.

07:06.367 --> 07:10.486
I mean, for somebody who's famous for
creating award-winning apps and software,

07:10.488 --> 07:11.738
- he's totally down to...
- Enough about Josh.

07:11.789 --> 07:14.374
earth.

07:14.408 --> 07:18.461
- Okay, can I tell you one more... thing?
- Shhh. Shhh. Shhhhhhh!

07:18.495 --> 07:21.631
My mom used to do this to me
when I talked too much.

07:21.665 --> 07:24.500
I just wanted to change the subject.

07:24.502 --> 07:26.636
Mom never did that.

07:26.670 --> 07:30.673
Um, what exactly did
Elliot tell you about me?

07:30.724 --> 07:34.561
Just that you were
single and I had a chance.

07:38.349 --> 07:39.766
You know what? I could really use a drink.

07:39.817 --> 07:41.734
How about a scotch on the rocks?

07:41.769 --> 07:45.688
Oh! You're just like me.
I love a good hard liquor.

07:56.784 --> 07:58.835
Gabi, my favorite Chef, how's it going?

07:58.869 --> 08:03.740
Elliot, you set me up
on a date with a woman?

08:03.757 --> 08:08.645
- I am not gay!
- I said that about myself for years.

08:08.679 --> 08:10.597
What were you thinking?

08:10.631 --> 08:14.384
Josh wasn't going to get on the list
unless you went on a date with Logan.

08:14.386 --> 08:15.718
She made that very clear.

08:15.753 --> 08:17.720
Why didn't you just tell
me that from the start?

08:17.771 --> 08:20.773
If I'd asked you to go on a
lesbian date, would you have gone?

08:20.808 --> 08:22.558
No!

08:22.610 --> 08:24.594
You gave me no choice then, did you?

08:25.646 --> 08:28.364
Look, you're Josh's last chance.

08:28.399 --> 08:33.785
So be funny, kiss her ass, or any other
body part you feel comfortable with.

08:34.221 --> 08:38.140
Elliot, I hate you so much right now.

08:38.191 --> 08:39.875
The next time I
see you, I'm gonna...

08:39.909 --> 08:43.863
- Hey!
- God, you're cute.

08:43.897 --> 08:47.817
No, I'm not! You
should see me without makeup.

08:47.868 --> 08:51.954
- Arf, arf.
- I bet you're fetching. Get it?

08:51.988 --> 08:55.157
Remember that time where you said
that we could take things slow?

08:55.159 --> 08:57.993
Oh, you don't? I do.

08:58.045 --> 09:00.746
Done. You know what? Listen.
Let's just take sex off the table.

09:00.797 --> 09:05.134
Yes, let's take
it off all the surfaces.

09:05.168 --> 09:07.308
I mean, I think on a first date

09:07.309 --> 09:09.843
- all you really need to do is kiss.
- Talk!

09:09.844 --> 09:11.841
I mean, how else do you
get to know each other

09:11.892 --> 09:13.175
- if you don't kiss...
- talk. I think...

09:13.177 --> 09:15.177
I think talking is
really the way to go here.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.730
You know, with talking... I
wanna know more about you!

09:17.764 --> 09:19.849
You know, like, what makes
you laugh? What makes you cry?

09:19.900 --> 09:22.068
Do you recycle? Have you
been to Washington, DC?

09:24.738 --> 09:26.856
Logan, I can't do this.

09:26.907 --> 09:28.991
I'm really sorry.

09:29.025 --> 09:31.026
I thought we were having fun.

09:31.078 --> 09:34.864
- Don't you find me attractive?
- Yeah, totally. You're beautiful.

09:34.915 --> 09:38.701
And if I were into girls,
right now we would be planning

09:38.752 --> 09:41.036
our fly-fishing honeymoon trip to Montana.

09:41.088 --> 09:42.838
Whoop!

09:44.040 --> 09:46.125
- Wait, you're straight?
- Oh, so straight.

09:46.176 --> 09:49.879
Well, then why did Elliot
tell me that you were...

09:49.930 --> 09:54.183
oh, God, to get Josh on the list.

09:54.217 --> 09:56.886
Yeah. Listen, I didn't
even know this was a date,

09:56.888 --> 09:58.971
until your hand was on my thigh.

10:00.056 --> 10:02.057
Though I probably should've

10:02.059 --> 10:06.112
realized that sooner, considering
there's only women here.

10:06.146 --> 10:08.898
This is one of the most
humiliating moments of my life.

10:08.949 --> 10:13.986
- Oh, man. Logan, I feel terrible.
-It's not your fault. It's my therapist.

10:14.037 --> 10:18.040
My girlfriend just broke up with me
and he told me to get back out there.

10:18.074 --> 10:20.075
As you can see,
it's going really well.

10:20.127 --> 10:22.211
No, no, don't... don't
cry. It's gonna be okay.

10:22.245 --> 10:25.247
We were together for two years, and
then she dumped me out of nowhere.

10:25.298 --> 10:28.217
And she won't answer my calls or my texts,

10:28.251 --> 10:29.919
and she won't even pick up her stuff.

10:31.087 --> 10:32.171
How much stuff are we talkin'?

10:32.222 --> 10:35.090
A lot. Not to mention her cat.

10:35.142 --> 10:39.895
She left her cat? You wanna know why?

10:39.930 --> 10:41.981
Because it has one eye and wears a diaper?

10:42.015 --> 10:44.934
No. Because she wants
a reason to come back.

10:44.985 --> 10:47.820
- She does?
- Yeah, she left a door open.

10:47.854 --> 10:49.205
A little kitty door.

10:49.239 --> 10:50.990
I'm gonna push her through it.

10:51.024 --> 10:52.942
How are you going to do that?

10:52.993 --> 10:55.161
You're going on a date with a lesbian?

10:55.195 --> 10:57.947
Well, technically, I've already
been on a date with a lesbian.

10:57.981 --> 10:59.949
This would be the second.

10:59.983 --> 11:01.834
We just did drinks, and now
we're moving on to dinner.

11:01.868 --> 11:04.086
Oh, you must really like her.

11:04.120 --> 11:08.451
Ha-ha. This time we're just doing it so
we can make Logan's ex-girlfriend jealous

11:08.452 --> 11:10.871
so she can get her back,
in exchange for Josh getting

11:10.872 --> 11:12.143
on her "Thirty Under Thirty" list.

11:12.178 --> 11:15.130
Wow. I went to work today,
made Hazelnut coffee,

11:15.182 --> 11:17.967
a couple phone calls, had
my boss's shoes resoled.

11:18.018 --> 11:21.136
You went to work and had two
lesbian dates with Logan Rawlings,

11:21.171 --> 11:23.138
the editor of San Francisco Monthly.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.974
How crazy and glamorous is your life?

11:25.025 --> 11:28.811
I know. Oh, and make
sure you don't eat anything,

11:28.813 --> 11:30.062
because I know we're gonna
go someplace really fancy

11:30.113 --> 11:31.814
and I'll bring you back a nice entree.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.149
- Ooh, and an overpriced dessert?
- Duh.

11:34.201 --> 11:36.235
Okay. Now, do I look hot?

11:36.286 --> 11:40.122
If you were somebody's ex-girlfriend and
you saw her walk in with me wearing this,

11:40.156 --> 11:43.158
- would you wanna get her back?
- Mmm, depends.

11:43.210 --> 11:45.878
Why did we break up? Have we
really worked through our issues?

11:45.912 --> 11:48.214
Has she changed? Because I
don't want to end up with her

11:48.248 --> 11:49.999
in the same place a year from now.

11:51.968 --> 11:56.005
- Tell me I look hot!
- You look hot. I won't wait up.

12:01.845 --> 12:04.847
I can't believe your ex
works at Judy Green's restaurant.

12:04.931 --> 12:06.815
She's like the coolest
Chef in San Francisco.

12:06.850 --> 12:07.900
I've been dying to come here.

12:07.934 --> 12:09.902
My ex is Judy Green.

12:11.771 --> 12:14.023
What?! You got dumped by Judy Green?

12:14.074 --> 12:15.024
That is so cool!

12:16.993 --> 12:19.111
My usual table.

12:19.162 --> 12:23.782
Um, you're paying, right? I
could never afford to eat here.

12:23.833 --> 12:26.035
I know. I saw your place
when I picked you up.

12:28.204 --> 12:30.956
Oh, this is great. We can see
the kitchen window from here.

12:31.007 --> 12:32.841
And there's Judy.

12:32.876 --> 12:35.210
Stuffing those sausages
without a hint of irony.

12:36.963 --> 12:39.882
- Isn't she pretty?
- Yes, but you're prettier.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.884
Okay, now all we have to
do is get her attention.

12:41.935 --> 12:45.888
Whatever I say, laugh like
I'm hilarious and adorable.

12:45.890 --> 12:49.942
I'm ordering two appetizers
and an entree for my friend.

12:52.996 --> 12:55.948
- She's not looking.
- Okay, you're a little impatient.

12:55.982 --> 12:58.984
I can see why Judy might've left.

12:59.035 --> 13:01.203
- Hey!
- I'm sorry.

13:01.237 --> 13:04.156
Okay, let's kick it up a
notch. Take a selfie of us.

13:04.207 --> 13:05.824
Ooh, I like your phone case.

13:05.875 --> 13:07.743
Gwen Stefani gave it to me.

13:11.916 --> 13:15.050
Okay. Now tweet it and write
"hashtag best date ever"

13:15.085 --> 13:17.970
with three dancing heart emojis.

13:18.004 --> 13:22.091
In high school, they used
to call me emoji-wan Kenobi.

13:22.142 --> 13:24.193
She's not looking.

13:24.227 --> 13:26.145
I don't think she has
a phone in the kitchen.

13:26.179 --> 13:28.931
- What are we gonna do now?
- All right, don't worry.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.034
I have one more trick up my sleeve. Judy!

13:34.070 --> 13:35.938
See? Works every time.

13:41.845 --> 13:43.962
Bam!

13:44.014 --> 13:47.016
I just pre-ordered five hundred
copies of San Francisco Monthly.

13:47.050 --> 13:49.218
You know that old saying,

13:49.269 --> 13:52.187
"don't buy a bunch of magazines
before you make the list?"

13:52.222 --> 13:55.958
Yeah, okay.

13:55.992 --> 14:00.062
It's a tweet from Logan. Maybe giving
me a little sneak peek of the list.

14:00.064 --> 14:04.133
- What the hell is this?
- It's hot tea. You asked me to get it.

14:04.167 --> 14:06.035
Not that. This!

14:06.069 --> 14:09.788
Oh! That's... that's called a "selfie".

14:09.823 --> 14:11.073
All the kids are doing it.

14:11.075 --> 14:13.208
Yeah but why are Logan and
Gabi doing it, together?

14:13.243 --> 14:16.995
Do any of us really know
why anyone does anything?

14:17.047 --> 14:20.249
It says, "hashtag best date ever".

14:20.283 --> 14:23.952
Oh, hashtag I did not see that coming.

14:25.255 --> 14:28.090
Elliot, what's going on?

14:28.092 --> 14:30.893
That's exactly what I would like to know.

14:30.927 --> 14:34.096
As soon as Gabi gets here tomorrow,
that's my first question for that girl.

14:35.298 --> 14:38.100
- I'm calling her.
- No!

14:38.151 --> 14:41.937
Look, I didn't want to have to tell you
this, but you weren't getting on the list.

14:41.939 --> 14:42.911
What?

14:42.912 --> 14:46.228
Which is why Gabi decided
to go on a date with Logan.

14:46.876 --> 14:49.828
She wanted to do everything
she could to make it happen.

14:49.863 --> 14:54.032
- I couldn't stop her.
- Oh, please!

14:54.084 --> 14:57.035
Let me get some bread
to go with that bologna!

14:58.872 --> 15:00.122
You pimped out my Chef?

15:00.156 --> 15:02.991
Yes! And I did it for you!

15:03.009 --> 15:05.761
For me? You mean for you.

15:05.795 --> 15:07.963
Because you're the one who's been
obsessed with getting me on that list.

15:08.031 --> 15:09.765
And I told you I didn't care about it!

15:09.799 --> 15:14.642
Oh, please. You just bought five hundred
copies of a magazine you're not even in!

15:14.643 --> 15:17.513
Admit it. You both wanted
to get on that list.

15:17.808 --> 15:20.008
- For him!
- What about her?

15:20.043 --> 15:21.860
- Who?
- Gabi!

15:26.149 --> 15:30.152
At least when Josh fires you,
you can add pimp to your resume.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.102
- Why isn't she coming over here?
- Oh, she will.

15:39.136 --> 15:42.221
Now, you feed me a bite and I'll feed you.

15:45.426 --> 15:48.344
Oh, my God, that is so good!

15:48.395 --> 15:51.347
You know what's really gonna bug
her? You just keep feeding me.

15:56.103 --> 15:58.237
She's coming over here! What do we do?

15:58.272 --> 16:00.189
Um, okay, don't worry.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.191
Sit back, let my plan play out.

16:02.226 --> 16:06.079
She's gonna come over, get super mad,
say she wants you back, and kick me out.

16:06.113 --> 16:09.082
So I'm just gonna keep eating
while I have the chance.

16:09.116 --> 16:12.035
Logan, what are you doing?
Is this some pathetic attempt

16:12.037 --> 16:15.338
- at making me jealous?
- That depends. Is it working?

16:17.007 --> 16:18.341
Logan? Hey, Gabi.

16:18.375 --> 16:22.378
- Uh, Josh, what are you doing here?
- Saving you.

16:22.429 --> 16:25.098
Look, you don't have to pretend to
be a lesbian to get me on the list.

16:25.132 --> 16:26.966
- Uh-oh.
- You're straight?

16:27.017 --> 16:31.220
No! Jeez, somebody's gaydar's on the Fritz!

16:31.255 --> 16:32.939
I think you're the one who's straight.

16:32.973 --> 16:37.110
I love women and boobs
and chopping firewood.

16:37.144 --> 16:39.112
Then what's he talking about?

16:39.146 --> 16:42.165
I don't know. He's just
some jealous ex-boyfriend.

16:42.199 --> 16:44.283
He's the person that I slept
with who made me realize

16:44.318 --> 16:48.237
that I am so over men and
way into the lady business.

16:48.288 --> 16:51.157
- Oh, God.
- I don't know what's happening.

16:51.208 --> 16:54.127
I do. This is a ruse.

16:54.129 --> 16:57.213
- You're not gay.
- Oh, yeah?

17:06.022 --> 17:08.974
Oh, my God. I do. You are on a date?

17:09.009 --> 17:11.260
How could you do this to me?!
You never had time for me.

17:11.295 --> 17:13.346
And now you bring another
woman into my restaurant?

17:13.396 --> 17:17.150
Oh, please! You're the one who left
me so you could focus on your career.

17:17.184 --> 17:20.403
How would you even know? You were
always asleep when I got home from work.

17:20.436 --> 17:22.152
Who goes to bed that early?

17:22.153 --> 17:26.943
Someone who drinks a whole bottle of syrah
waiting for her girlfriend to get home.

17:26.993 --> 17:30.146
I never want to see you again!

17:30.180 --> 17:31.114
You're dead to me!

17:35.285 --> 17:37.954
Great plan, Gabi. Worked like a charm.

17:37.956 --> 17:41.290
Well, the making her
really mad part worked.

17:46.130 --> 17:48.381
No. Let me get this. Please.
It's the least I can do.

17:48.432 --> 17:52.402
Thanks. This is the worst night of my life.

17:54.138 --> 17:55.972
Oh, my God, Logan!

17:55.974 --> 17:57.273
- Are you okay?
- I think she's choking!

17:57.307 --> 18:00.276
Help! Anyone! We need one of
those paddle-y-thingamadoodads!

18:00.310 --> 18:03.279
- That's for a heart attack!
- Logan!

18:04.982 --> 18:08.201
Are you okay?

18:08.235 --> 18:10.987
Your entire life just
flashed before my eyes!

18:11.038 --> 18:12.371
Judy, you just saved my life.

18:12.406 --> 18:17.126
Oh, God. When I said you were dead to me,
I didn't want you to really be "dead" dead.

18:17.161 --> 18:20.163
That's so romantic.

18:20.165 --> 18:22.298
Next time you're drinking
from a bottle of syrah,

18:22.332 --> 18:24.333
it'll be a bottle I bring
home from the restaurant.

18:24.384 --> 18:29.222
Oh. Just be sure. I
like to go to bed early.

18:33.177 --> 18:36.229
Oh, on the way home tonight,
we need to buy more cat diapers.

18:36.263 --> 18:39.265
Oh! I've waited so long
to hear those words.

18:41.235 --> 18:43.402
How lucky are we that she choked?

18:43.437 --> 18:45.354
Pretty lucky.

18:45.405 --> 18:47.440
That was genius.

18:47.491 --> 18:50.409
- What was genius?
- His plan.

18:50.444 --> 18:54.080
What... No! Josh!

18:54.114 --> 18:56.199
I was so worried! You
had me scared to death!

18:56.201 --> 18:58.417
I know. You were
great. You really sold that.

18:58.452 --> 19:00.336
Thanks.

19:01.371 --> 19:04.123
Hey, Gabi. I autographed
my cookbook for you.

19:04.174 --> 19:07.043
Oh, thank you! "Eating
out with Judy Green".

19:07.094 --> 19:08.911
Oh, that's clever.

19:10.264 --> 19:15.051
"Stay away from my
girlfriend or I'll cut you".

19:15.102 --> 19:17.270
She is lovely.

19:17.304 --> 19:20.106
Hey, Gabi, thanks for everything.

19:20.140 --> 19:25.895
Oh, sure. And just before you
go, um, not that I care, at all,

19:25.946 --> 19:29.398
but, you know, out of
curiosity, how was, um... um...

19:29.400 --> 19:33.119
- How was the kiss?
- Garlicky.

19:34.238 --> 19:37.073
- But great.
- Oh, good.

19:37.075 --> 19:38.908
And Josh, I owe you one.

19:38.959 --> 19:41.377
We're even.

19:41.411 --> 19:43.079
Seriously, I don't need to be on your list.

19:43.130 --> 19:45.998
Good to know. Later, guys.

19:46.049 --> 19:50.052
Bye! What is wrong with you?!

19:50.087 --> 19:51.254
"I don't need to be on the list?"

19:51.256 --> 19:53.389
Do you know how hard I worked
to get you on that list?

19:53.423 --> 19:57.260
I went on a date with that woman, and
I gave her the best kiss of her life.

19:57.311 --> 19:59.095
You heard her, she raved about it!

20:01.031 --> 20:03.182
And I appreciate that.

20:03.233 --> 20:06.435
Man, did I appreciate that.

20:06.437 --> 20:10.106
But I realized I don't need to be
on some list to validate who I am.

20:10.140 --> 20:11.157
I've got a Porsche for that.

20:14.111 --> 20:17.029
But I can't believe what
you did for me back there.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.282
So I want to do something nice for
you. Whatever you want. Name it.

20:19.333 --> 20:25.391
- Can I drive your Porsche?
- Let's be real.

20:32.395 --> 20:33.645
Oops.

20:33.696 --> 20:37.532
Could you please be a dear and pass
me back that San Francisco Monthly?

20:42.372 --> 20:45.407
Oh! I'm such a butterfingers!

20:45.409 --> 20:48.243
Why don't you have a
peek at page forty-seven?

20:48.245 --> 20:50.328
Elliot, I'm done with the list.

20:50.380 --> 20:52.664
- I don't want to see it.
- Just have a little peek.

20:52.715 --> 20:55.417
A peekaboo. A peekaroony. A pekinese.

20:55.468 --> 20:58.503
I don't give a shih-tzu. I'm over it.

20:58.554 --> 21:01.223
Would you look at the damn magazine!

21:01.257 --> 21:04.426
You're number five!

21:04.428 --> 21:06.428
- No.
- No?

21:06.430 --> 21:08.430
- We're number five.
- We did it!

21:09.515 --> 21:11.183
What's going on in here?

21:11.234 --> 21:12.317
We made the list!

21:12.351 --> 21:13.351
We did it!
