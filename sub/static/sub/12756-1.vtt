00:57.674 --> 00:59.175
OKAY.

00:59.175 --> 01:02.178
YOU DON'T 
WANNA MOVE...

01:03.680 --> 01:05.682
I'LL MOVE YOUMYSELF.

OH, JESUS...

03:46.976 --> 03:49.479
MA'AM, WHEN THESEALIENS
WERE EXAMINING YOU,

03:49.479 --> 03:52.482
WAS THERE ANY
PENETRATION INVOLVED ?

03:52.482 --> 03:54.484
A 14-YEAR-OLD 
TENNIS STAR

03:54.484 --> 03:56.986
SHOULDN'T BE SHOOTIN' UP

03:56.986 --> 03:58.988

04:15.755 --> 04:17.257
LET ME SEE THAT.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.757
HEY !

04:18.757 --> 04:20.760
GIVE THAT BACK !

04:28.518 --> 04:30.386
WHERE'S 
MY PICTURE ?

04:30.386 --> 04:32.388
WHERE'S MY GODDAMN
DEAD BABY ?!

04:32.388 --> 04:34.891
I TOLD YOU BEFORE, LIBBY,
DO NOT FUCK WITH MY STUFF.

04:34.891 --> 04:37.393
AND I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
DON'TFUCKWITH ME.

04:37.393 --> 04:39.395
MORRISON CUT YOUR 
GODDAMN DEAD BABY.

04:39.395 --> 04:41.397
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT, HOTSHOT,

04:41.397 --> 04:43.783
TAKE IT UP 
WITH HIM.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.539
( grunting )

04:57.547 --> 05:01.050
( man )
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT 
"INSIDE VIEW" IS, MISS BLAIR...

05:06.556 --> 05:09.058
IT'S A MICROSCOPE...

05:09.058 --> 05:11.561
A CULTURAL MICROSCOPE

05:11.561 --> 05:14.564
FOCUSING IN ON
THE COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS

05:14.564 --> 05:17.066
OF THE AMERICAN
POPULACE.

05:17.066 --> 05:19.569
NOW WHAT WE DO HERE AT
"INSIDE VIEW", KATHERINE,

05:20.069 --> 05:22.572
IS IDENTIFY AND DEFINE
THE CULTURAL ARCHETYPE

05:23.072 --> 05:24.824
OF THE 
AMERICAN MIND.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.326
NOW, READ THAT
LIST BACK TO ME,

05:26.826 --> 05:28.828
THE STORIES I WANT YOU
LOOKING FOR.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.330
ALIEN ABDUCTIONS...

05:30.330 --> 05:32.832
AMUSING 
ANIMAL STORIES...

05:32.832 --> 05:34.334
ATTACKS ON 
THE HANDICAPPED.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.452
ONLY IF 
IT HAS A TWIST,

05:36.452 --> 05:38.454
SOME KIND OF KINKY SEX
IN THERE OR SOMETHING.

05:38.955 --> 05:40.456
BATTERED WIVES...

05:40.456 --> 05:42.959
BIZARRE
BODY FUNCTIONS...

05:42.959 --> 05:44.961
BREAST SURGERY
HORROR STORIES.

05:44.961 --> 05:46.963
THAT'S ALWAYS GOOD.

05:46.963 --> 05:49.966
"C", CELEBRITIES...
ADDICTED, PERVERTED,

05:49.966 --> 05:51.467
DYING, DEAD.

05:51.467 --> 05:53.219
AND OF COURSE
BACK FROM THE DEAD.

05:53.219 --> 05:55.221
DEMONIC POSSESSION...

05:56.723 --> 05:58.725
JUST BECAUSE YOU 
DON'T HAVE ANY BALLS

05:59.225 --> 06:01.227
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN
CUT MINE OFF.

06:01.227 --> 06:02.729
'MORNING, 
RICHARD.

06:02.729 --> 06:05.231
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I HAD TO DO
WITH THAT MORGUE ATTENDANT

06:05.231 --> 06:06.733
TO GET 
THAT PICTURE ?

06:06.733 --> 06:09.235
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW COLD THOSE SLABS ARE ?

06:09.736 --> 06:11.371
KATHERINE, THIS EMOTIONALLY
UNSTABLE INDIVIDUAL

06:11.371 --> 06:13.373
IS RICHARD DEES,
OUR SENIOR REPORTER.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.491
KATHERINE BLAIR.

06:15.491 --> 06:16.993
IT'S VERY NICE 
TO MEET YOU.

06:16.993 --> 06:19.495
DID HE SPOUT OFF 
ABOUT THAT

06:19.495 --> 06:21.497
COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUSNESS
CRAP YET ?

06:21.998 --> 06:23.499
KATHERINE,
WE'LL FINISH THIS LATER.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.002
SURE,
NO PROBLEM.

06:26.002 --> 06:28.755
THANK YOU, MR. MORRISON,
FOR EVERYTHING.

06:28.755 --> 06:30.757
I WON'T 
LET YOU DOWN.

06:31.257 --> 06:32.759
WELCOME TO "INSIDE VIEW",
KATHERINE.

06:33.259 --> 06:33.760
THANKS.

06:34.260 --> 06:36.262
IT WAS 
NICE MEETING YOU.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.265
WHAT ABOUT 
MY PICTURE ?

06:39.265 --> 06:41.401
WE ALL 
LOVE YOUR PICTURES,

06:41.401 --> 06:43.403
BUT IN THE FUTURE,
JUST AS A ROUGH GUIDELINE,

06:43.403 --> 06:45.905
LET'S KEEP THE VICTIMS 
OVER TWO YEARS OLD, OKAY ?

06:45.905 --> 06:47.907
NOW SIT DOWN, PLEASE,
I GOTTA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.915
SORRY, 
MR. MORRISON,

06:55.915 --> 06:57.917
I FORGOT 
MY PURSE.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.920
THANK YOU.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.427
SO WHAT DO YOU 
THINK OF KATHERINE ?

07:07.927 --> 07:09.929
ANOTHER 
JIMMY OLSEN.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.931
SHE DOESN'T HAVE 
MUCH EXPERIENCE

07:11.931 --> 07:13.933
BUT SHE'S SHARP,
GOOD INSTINCTS,

07:13.933 --> 07:15.435
GREAT ASS.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.437
DID YOU
MENTION TO HER

07:17.437 --> 07:19.439
WHY THE POSITION 
OPENED UP ?

07:19.439 --> 07:22.442
OF COURSE I DIDN'T,
I WANTED TOHIREHER, 
NOT SCARE HER AWAY.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.945
THERE'S NO REASON SHE NEEDS
TO KNOW ABOUT DOTTIE.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.947
ANYWAY, LOOK,
HERE'S YOUR NEXT ASSIGNMENT.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.949
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING
NINA BRIGGS.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.452
SHE'S DOWN TO 75 POUNDS,
SHE WON'T BE AROUND FOR LONG.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.953
SHE CAN STAY OR GO,

07:34.454 --> 07:36.456
WHO CARES ?
A COUNTRY STAR WITH AIDS ?

07:36.456 --> 07:38.458
THAT'S WAY TOO SOFT
A STORY FOR YOU.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.460
BESIDES, THIS IS
MUCH MORE UP YOUR ALLEY.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.462
THIS IS GONNA BE A BIG ONE,
RICHARD, REALLY BIG.

07:42.962 --> 07:46.082
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GONNA
WANNA READ ABOUT THIS GUY.

07:46.082 --> 07:47.583
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

07:50.586 --> 07:52.088
A MAN...

07:52.088 --> 07:54.590
NO, A MAN WHO THINKS 
HE'S MORE THAN A MAN.

07:54.590 --> 07:57.093
FLIES INTO DESOLATE AIRPORTS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

07:57.093 --> 08:00.096
AND KILLS WHATEVER POOR SCHMUCK
HAPPENS TO BE AROUND...

08:00.096 --> 08:01.597
DRAINS THE BODY 
OF THE BLOOD.

08:01.597 --> 08:03.599
THEN HE 
FLIES AWAY AGAIN

08:03.599 --> 08:05.735
IN SEARCH OF HIS NEXT
UNSUSPECTING VICTIM.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.737
AND HE CALLS HIMSELF
DWIGHT RENFIELD.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.239
DWIGHT JUST HAPPENS TO BE
THE FIRST NAME OF AN ACTOR

08:10.740 --> 08:12.241
NAMED DWIGHT FRY,

08:12.241 --> 08:13.743
WHO PLAYED THE ROLE
OF RENFIELD,

08:13.743 --> 08:17.246
THE BUG EATING LUNATIC
IN THE 1931 VERSION
OF "DRACULA".

08:17.246 --> 08:18.748
C'MON, RICHARD,
THAT'S NOT A STORY ?!

08:19.248 --> 08:21.250
THE GUY'S A MOVIE FAN,
SO WHAT ?

08:21.250 --> 08:23.252
VAMPIRES ARE A DIME A DOZEN
IN THE TABS.

08:23.252 --> 08:25.755
NEXT TIME THIS PSYCHO GOES OUT
THEY'RE GONNA NAIL HIM.

08:26.255 --> 08:27.507
WHY IS THAT ?

08:27.507 --> 08:30.259
THEY'VE GOT THE MAKE OF 
HIS PLANE AND THE TAIL NUMBER.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.761
IF YOU WANTED 
TO ROB BANKS,

08:32.761 --> 08:35.765
WOULD YOU DO IT WITH THE SAME
CAR AND LICENSE PLATE
EVERY TIME ?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.767
NO ONE'S 
CAUGHT HIMYET.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.770
LOOK, PUT THAT PILOT LICENSE 
AND PLANE OF YOURS TO SOME USE.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.773
BESIDES, YOU'RE GOOD WITH
THE HICKS, YOU'RE THE BEST.

08:44.273 --> 08:45.775
THANK YOU.

08:46.275 --> 08:49.779
YOU NEED THIS ONE, RICHARD,
TAKE MY WORD ON IT.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.231
YOUR WORK HAS BEEN
A LITTLE LACKING LATELY.

08:52.231 --> 08:54.984
YOU HAVEN'T HIT
THE FRONT PAGES INMONTHS,

08:54.984 --> 08:56.986
AND THIS IS 
FRONT PAGE MATERIAL !

08:56.986 --> 09:00.373
THIS IS A WASTE OF SPACE
IS WHAT IT IS.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.625
IT'S A WASTE 
OF MY TIME.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.627
I'LL STILL GONNA RUN IT,
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU !

09:04.627 --> 09:06.879
AND IT'S GONNA BE
A SCREAMER, GUARANTEE IT !

09:07.880 --> 09:10.883
WHY DON'T YOU 
GIVE IT TO JIMMY ?

09:12.385 --> 09:15.888
SOMETHING NICE AND JUICY FOR HER
TO SINK HER TEETH INTO.

09:17.139 --> 09:18.140
FUCKING PRICK !

09:33.456 --> 09:34.440
( car starts )

10:08.190 --> 10:10.693
"LACKING" MY ASS.

10:17.316 --> 10:19.318
( Richard )
OH,SHIT!

10:26.709 --> 10:28.210
HI, MR. DEES.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.211
HI.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.713
I'M KATHERINE BLAIR,

10:30.713 --> 10:32.214
WE MET THIS MORNING
IN MR. MORRISON'S OFFICE.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.083
YOU REMEMBER ME ?

10:34.083 --> 10:35.584
I REMEMBER YOU,
JIMMY.

10:35.584 --> 10:36.335
"JIMMY."

10:36.335 --> 10:39.338
AS IN "OLSEN".

10:41.223 --> 10:42.842
YOU MIND 
IF I JOIN YOU ?

10:43.342 --> 10:44.844
DO I HAVE A CHOICE ?

10:45.344 --> 10:46.345
NO.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.232
SO...

10:50.232 --> 10:52.735
WHAT AN EXCITING FIRST DAY
THIS TURNED OUT TO BE.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.737
I ALREADY GOT 
MY FIRST ASSIGNMENT,

10:54.737 --> 10:56.238
A PIECE ABOUT 
A PSYCHO PILOT

10:56.238 --> 10:57.740
WHO THINKS 
HE'S A VAMPIRE.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.742
I KNOW, I ALREADY 
PISSED ON IT--

11:00.242 --> 11:02.745
I PASSED ON IT.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.246
WHY ARE 
YOU HERE ?

11:04.246 --> 11:06.248
I DOUBT YOU FOLLOWED ME
JUST TO SHOOT THE SHIT.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.750
I DIDN'T 
FOLLOW YOU.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.251
I WAS JUST--

11:09.251 --> 11:11.253
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

11:12.254 --> 11:15.257
YOU'RE HERE NOW,
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

11:17.760 --> 11:19.762
WELL, OKAY...

11:20.262 --> 11:21.764
I GUESS 
I WAS HOPING

11:21.764 --> 11:24.767
THATYOUCOULD GIVE ME THE
INSIDE VIEW OF "INSIDE VIEW".

11:24.767 --> 11:27.770
WHO BETTER TO LEARN FROM 
THAN THE PAPER'S STAR REPORTER ?

11:27.770 --> 11:31.273
MAYBE YOU COULD SHARE
YOUR PHILOSOPHY WITH ME.

11:31.273 --> 11:32.775
MY "PHILOSOPHY".

11:33.275 --> 11:35.277
YOUR SECRET, FOR STAYING
ON TOP SO LONG.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.779
I'D LOVE 
TO HEAR IT.

11:36.779 --> 11:39.281
THAT IS 
IF YOU HAVE ONE.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.783
UH...

11:43.285 --> 11:44.286
OKAY.

11:44.286 --> 11:46.789
HERE IT IS,
YOU BETTER TAKE NOTES...

11:47.790 --> 11:50.793
NEVER BELIEVE 
WHAT YOU PUBLISH...

11:50.793 --> 11:53.796
AND NEVER PUBLISH
WHAT YOU BELIEVE.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.801
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
I TALK TOO FAST ?

12:00.302 --> 12:02.805
I GUESS I WAS 
JUST EXPECTING

12:02.805 --> 12:04.306
SOMETHING MORE.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.810
FROM SOMEONE WHO THINKS
OF HIMSELF AS A--

12:07.810 --> 12:09.311
AS A WHAT ?

12:09.311 --> 12:10.813
WELL...

12:10.813 --> 12:12.815
A REAL REPORTER.

12:12.815 --> 12:13.816
HA !

12:13.816 --> 12:15.317
HA-HA !

12:17.319 --> 12:19.822
LET ME 
ASK YOU A QUESTION.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.825
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU KNOW 
ABOUT BEING A REAL REPORTER ?

12:22.825 --> 12:23.826
GODDAMNIT !

12:24.326 --> 12:26.328
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T
MEAN TO OFFEND YOU.

12:26.328 --> 12:27.830
WHY DON'T 
WE START OVER ?

12:28.330 --> 12:31.333
I KNOW YOUR STORY, HONEY, 
I HEARD IT A MILLION TIMES.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.335
YOU COME FROM LOCKPORT
OR ROCKPORT,

12:33.335 --> 12:35.337
OR BRIDGEPORT,
OR EUGENE, OREGON,

12:35.337 --> 12:37.339
OR SOME 
GODDAMN PLACE.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.341
YOU TRIED TO GET INTO
COLUMBIA OR YALE,

12:39.842 --> 12:42.845
BUT YOU ENDED UP
AT ILLINOIS STATE, DIDN'T YOU ?

12:42.845 --> 12:46.348
THEN YOU 
INTERNED FOR

12:46.348 --> 12:48.851
"THE EXAMINER"
OR "THE PATRIOT".

12:48.851 --> 12:50.853
HELP ME HERE, 
PLEASE.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.354
"THE HERALD."

12:52.354 --> 12:54.356
YOU COVERED EVERYTHING
FROM CAKE SALES,

12:54.356 --> 12:56.358
TO DOG SHOWS,
TO CLASS REUNIONS.

12:56.358 --> 12:58.360
BUT THAT GOT A LITTLE
MUNDANE FOR YOU, DIDN'T IT ?

12:58.360 --> 13:01.363
SO YOU CAME TO US FOR JUST 
A LITTLE MORE SPICE.

13:01.363 --> 13:04.366
OF COURSE THE MONEY,
STOP ME IF I'M WRONG HERE.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.368
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT,
MR. DEES ?

13:09.371 --> 13:12.374
YOU'VE BEEN 
HERE BEFORE, JIMMY,

13:12.374 --> 13:14.376
AND YOU'LL 
BE HERE AGAIN.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.879
THE FACES CHANGE 
BUT THE END IS ALWAYS THE SAME.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.881
YOU WON'T LAST.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.383
MAYBE 
I'LL SURPRISE YOU.

13:21.383 --> 13:23.385
MAYBE YOU WILL.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.389
MAYBE YOU'LL STICK AROUND
FOR A WHILE...

13:27.389 --> 13:29.391
END UP 
JUST LIKE DOTTIE.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.894
WHAT ARE YOU 
TALKING ABOUT ?

13:33.395 --> 13:36.899
YOU WANT MY INSIDE VIEW 
OF "INSIDE VIEW"...

13:36.899 --> 13:39.401
ALRIGHT,
I'LL GIVE IT TO YA.

13:39.401 --> 13:42.404
AND IT AIN'T ABOUT NO FUCKING
PHILOSOPHY, BELIEVE ME.

13:42.404 --> 13:45.908
"INSIDE VIEW" IS AN
ILLUSTRATION OF THE INSANE.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.410
IT'S A DIARY OF THE DERANGED
AND DANGEROUSLY SICK...

13:48.911 --> 13:51.914
KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS 
SETTING FIRE TO THEIR STUDENTS

13:51.914 --> 13:53.916
BECAUSE THEY THINK
THESE 5-YEAR-OLDS

13:53.916 --> 13:56.168
ARE PLOTTING
THEIR EXECUTIONS.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.671
SATANIC BIKER CULTS
SLAUGHTERING HITCHHIKERS,

13:58.671 --> 14:00.923
BUT, HERE'S 
THE FUN PART...

14:00.923 --> 14:03.425
AFTER TALKING 
TO THESE CRAZY PEOPLE

14:03.425 --> 14:04.927
ALL DAY,
EVERY SINGLE DAY,

14:04.927 --> 14:07.429
SOMETIMES THEIR STORIES
CAN GET TO YOU.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.182
CREEPING LIKE SOME 
FUCKING CANCER

14:10.182 --> 14:14.303
AND PRETTY SOON ALL THE SHIT
STARTS MAKING SENSE.

14:15.804 --> 14:18.307
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
TO DOTTIE WALSH.

14:18.307 --> 14:20.309
REAL GO-GETTER,
JUST LIKE YOU.

14:20.809 --> 14:23.312
SHE STARTED TO BELIEVE
IN THE UNBELIEVABLE.

14:23.312 --> 14:26.198
NOT MORE THAN A YEAR 
AFTER DOTTIE WAS HIRED...

14:26.198 --> 14:28.200
SHE WAS DEAD.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.704
WENT HOME ONE NIGHT
AND TOOK A BATH

14:32.204 --> 14:34.707
WITH A DRY CLEANING BAG
WRAPPED AROUND HER HEAD.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.217
BYE, BYE, DOTTIE...

14:46.468 --> 14:48.470
HELLO, JIMMY.

14:52.224 --> 14:55.177
MADE FOR A KILLER
HEADLINE, THOUGH.

14:59.181 --> 15:01.183
I'M SORRY 
I BOTHERED YOU.

15:01.183 --> 15:02.818
THAT'S OKAY.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.820
I THOUGHT MAYBE 
WE COULD BE FRIENDS, BUT--

15:04.820 --> 15:05.821
YEAH, WELL.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.823
I GUESS 
I WAS WRONG.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.078
JIMMY...

15:13.579 --> 15:15.581
LISTEN TO ME NOW,
I DON'THAVEFRIENDS.

15:16.081 --> 15:19.702
I'VE GOT MY CAMERA,
MY PLANE AND MY STORIES,

15:20.202 --> 15:22.705
THAT'S ALL I WANT
AND THAT'S ALL I NEED.

15:22.705 --> 15:25.207
SO, IF YOU 
WANT A FRIEND,

15:25.207 --> 15:26.709
BUY A DOG.

15:27.459 --> 15:29.595
NO HARD FEELINGS.

16:32.274 --> 16:34.276
( man )
HELP ME !

17:20.873 --> 17:23.876
HELP ME,
HELP ME !

17:24.877 --> 17:26.878
HELP ME !

17:30.382 --> 17:32.384
( crashing sounds )

17:39.391 --> 17:41.894
( man )
HELP ME, HELP ME !

18:07.419 --> 18:08.921
( man gagging )

18:44.740 --> 18:47.493
ALRIGHT, WHAT'S SO
GODDAMN IMPORTANT ?

18:49.495 --> 18:52.498
OUR BATTY FRIEND...

18:52.498 --> 18:54.500
HAS STRUCK AGAIN.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.002
IS THAT SO ?

18:57.002 --> 18:59.505
LAST NIGHT,
DUFFREY, MARYLAND.

18:59.505 --> 19:02.508
A LITTLE PISSANT TOWN
60 MILES OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON.

19:03.008 --> 19:05.511
GOT CLEAN AWAY, TOO.

19:06.011 --> 19:08.514
YOU SHOULDN'T LET IT
BOTHER YOU, RICHARD.

19:08.514 --> 19:10.766
AFTER ALL THIS IS 
AYOUNGMAN'S BUSINESS...

19:10.766 --> 19:13.769
OR YOUNGWOMAN'S.

19:13.769 --> 19:16.905
THAT'S RIGHT,
KATHERINE FOUND IT.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.907
SOMEHOW SHE TAPPED
INTO A NETWORK

19:19.024 --> 19:21.026
OF LOCAL LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

19:21.026 --> 19:23.028
WHAT THAT 
COMPUTER OF HERS...

19:23.028 --> 19:25.030
SEARCHED THROUGH
100 MURDER WIRES

19:25.531 --> 19:27.032
TO FIND ONE THAT FIT
OUR BAD BOY'S M.O.,

19:27.032 --> 19:30.035
HAD THE INFORMATION,
WAITING FOR ME, 
ON MY DESK.

19:30.035 --> 19:32.538
NOWTHAT 
IS AMBITION.

19:32.538 --> 19:35.290
GIVE ME THE FILE.

19:39.294 --> 19:42.297
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY,
THAT I WAS WRONG ?

19:42.297 --> 19:44.299
JUST THAT YOU
MIGHT'VE BEEN WRONG ?

19:44.299 --> 19:47.803
YOU KNOW WHAT 
A PUSSYCAT I AM.

19:48.804 --> 19:52.808
OKAY, I MIGHT'VE BEEN WRONG,
YOU HAPPY NOW ?

19:52.808 --> 19:56.812
HOW VERY LARGE-HEARTED
OF YOU TO ADMIT IT.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.716
FIRST THIS GUY 
CLAIRE BOWIE IN MAINE,

20:17.716 --> 20:21.220
THEN BUCK KENDALL
IN NEW YORK.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.223
AND NOW RAY AND
ELLEN SARCH IN MARYLAND.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.727
THERE'S DEFINITELY A STORY HERE
THAT NEEDS TO BE TOLD.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.732
AND I THINK I HEAR DWIGHT
CALLINGYOURNAME RICHARD.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.236
ANYBODY FROM THE STRAIGHT PRESS
PICK UP ON THIS ?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.238
IF YOU'RE ASKING
IF ANYONE'S SUGGESTING

20:39.238 --> 20:43.242
THERE'S A SERIAL KILLER
FLYING AROUND OUT THERE,
THE ANSWER'S NO.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.245
BUT THE FAA AND COPS
ARE TRYING TO 
KEEP THIS HUSH-HUSH.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.865
HERE THEY ARE,
MR. MORRISON.

20:49.865 --> 20:51.867
WE NEED TO KNOW
WHICH ONE TO RUN,

20:51.867 --> 20:53.869
WE GO TO PRESS
IN 20 MINUTES.

20:53.869 --> 20:55.370
WHAT'S THAT ?

20:55.370 --> 20:57.372
IT'S TOMORROW'S 
EDITION...

20:57.372 --> 21:00.626
IF YOU WANT IT 
TO BE, THAT IS.

21:02.127 --> 21:03.629
SO...

21:03.629 --> 21:05.631
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE ?

21:05.631 --> 21:08.133
YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH.

21:08.133 --> 21:10.135
IS THAT A YES ?

21:10.135 --> 21:11.520
RUN IT.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.523
WHAT'S THAT, PLAN "B",
AS IN BLAIR ?

21:14.523 --> 21:16.024
NOT IMPORTANT.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.026
I WANNA RUN 
THIS GUY'S BACK TRAIL

21:18.026 --> 21:19.528
STARTING WITH THE
FIRST MURDER WE KNOW ABOUT,

21:19.528 --> 21:21.530
UP IN MAINE, 
RIGHT ?

21:21.530 --> 21:23.532
WHAT ABOUT YOUR 
NINA BRIGGS STORY ?

21:23.532 --> 21:25.033
FUCK NINA BRIGGS.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.034
NOT ME !

21:26.034 --> 21:28.036
THERE IS ONE 
SMALL PROBLEM, RICHARD.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.802
KATHERINE, I'M AFRAID
I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.305
THE STORY IS MINE,
YOU GAVE IT TOME.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.307
LOOKS LIKE
HE'S TAKING IT BACK.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.809
I APOLOGIZE ABOUT THIS,
BUT DEES IS BACK ON THE STORY.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.811
NOW GIVE HIM YOUR FILES
IF YOU WOULD.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.313
MR. MORRISON,
IF I--

21:54.313 --> 21:56.815
PLEASE, I MADE MY DECISION,
JUST DO IT.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.324
THANK YOU, 
DEAR.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.329
I SUPPOSE 
YOU WANT THIS TOO ?

22:12.331 --> 22:14.833
I HAVE MY OWN 
PLANE, THANKS.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.487
HOW YOU DOING,
FRIEND ?

23:29.491 --> 23:32.861
DON'T BELIEVE 
I KNOWYOU,MISTER.

23:32.861 --> 23:34.863
MY NAME'S RICHARD DEES,
I'M A REPORTER.

23:34.863 --> 23:37.499
I WAS WONDERING IF I CAN
TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.501
EZRA HANNON.

23:39.501 --> 23:42.504
I FIX THINGS AROUND HERE,
WORK THE PLANES.

23:42.504 --> 23:44.756
WHAT PAPER YOU SAY
YOU'RE FROM ?

23:45.257 --> 23:47.259
"INSIDE VIEW",
YOU KNOW IT ?

23:47.259 --> 23:48.877
OH, YEAH.

23:48.877 --> 23:52.380
MY WIFE MARTHA 
READS YOUR PAPER.

23:52.380 --> 23:54.883
AFTER SHE'S 
DONE WITH IT

23:54.883 --> 23:57.385
I USE IT TO LINE
OUR KITTY'S TOILET BOX.

23:57.385 --> 23:59.387
SOAK'S UP THAT 
CAT PISS REAL GOOD.

24:00.388 --> 24:03.391
THEN YOU WON'T MIND
ANSWERING A FEW QUESTIONS.

24:04.893 --> 24:07.896
YOU WANNA TALK TO ME 
ABOUT THE KILLING

24:07.896 --> 24:10.398
OF MY FRIEND CLAIRE BOWIE,
DON'T YOU ?

24:10.398 --> 24:11.900
HOW DID 
YOU KNOW THAT ?

24:12.400 --> 24:14.903
AIN'T NO OTHER REASON
CITY FOLKS VISIT THESE PARTS,

24:15.153 --> 24:18.156
EXCEPT SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS,
AND THIS WAS...

24:18.156 --> 24:20.158
REAL BAD.

24:20.659 --> 24:22.661
BUT I GOTTA 
TELL YOU,

24:22.661 --> 24:25.163
I ALREADY TOLD EVERYTHING
I KNOW TO THE POLICE.

24:25.163 --> 24:27.666
BUT, SEE,
I'M NOT THE POLICE.

24:27.666 --> 24:30.168
THIS'LL ONLY
TAKE A FEW MINUTES

24:30.168 --> 24:32.170
SO IF YOU 
DON'T MIND.

24:32.170 --> 24:34.673
I SUPPOSE 
IT'LL BE ALRIGHT.

24:34.673 --> 24:37.676
SPEAK LOUD AND CLEARLY 
AND YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED

24:37.676 --> 24:40.178
THE NIGHT THAT
CLAIRE WAS MURDERED.

24:40.178 --> 24:43.181
IT ALL BEGAN THE NIGHT
BEFORECLAIRE WAS MURDERED.

24:43.181 --> 24:46.184
THE NIGHT THAT BASTARD 
FLEW IN HERE.

24:46.685 --> 24:49.688
THAT PLANE WAS A 
BLACK SKY MASTER, RIGHT ?

24:49.688 --> 24:52.190
3-3-7, 
WITH RED PIPING,

24:52.190 --> 24:54.693
TAIL NUMBER 1-0-1,
BRAVO LIMA ?

24:54.693 --> 24:57.696
IT WAS ONE OF THEM  
SKY MASTERS ALRIGHT.

24:57.696 --> 25:00.198
AT LEAST 
I THINK IT WAS.

25:00.198 --> 25:04.202
I CAN'T SAY AS I REMEMBER
THE TAIL NUMBER...

25:04.202 --> 25:06.705
BECAUSE I DON'T.

25:06.705 --> 25:08.707
AIN'T THAT 
THE DAMNDEST THING ?

25:08.707 --> 25:10.208
DOESN'T MATTER.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.961
DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL,
YOU JUST GO ON AHEAD NOW.

25:12.961 --> 25:15.964
THE NIGHT SHIFT
BELONGED TO CLAIRE.

25:15.964 --> 25:19.467
QUIET MOST TIME,
BUT NOT THAT NIGHT.

25:21.469 --> 25:23.471
NO, SIR...

25:23.471 --> 25:25.473
NOT THAT NIGHT.

25:41.656 --> 25:44.159
( plane approaching )

25:52.918 --> 25:54.419
( Ezra )
MY SHIFT WAS OVER

25:54.920 --> 25:56.922
AND I WAS LOADING UP 
TO HEAD HOME...

25:59.424 --> 26:02.928
THAT'S WHEN 
HECAME DOWN.

26:07.933 --> 26:09.935
LET ME TELL YOU,
MISTER...

26:09.935 --> 26:12.437
RIGHT FROM THE GET-GO

26:12.437 --> 26:15.440
THAT FELLA 
DIDN'T SEEM PROPER.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.810
JUST SORTAOFF.

26:19.327 --> 26:21.329
( Richard )
WHY WAS THAT ?

26:21.329 --> 26:24.332
( Ezra )
HE WAS WEARING 
A BIG CLOAK.

26:24.332 --> 26:25.834
HE WAS.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.838
RED AS A FIRE ENGINE 
INSIDE,

26:30.338 --> 26:33.341
BLACK AS A WOODCHUCK'S
ASSHOLEOUTSIDE.

26:33.341 --> 26:36.344
AND WHEN IT 
SPREAD OUT BEHIND HIM,

26:36.845 --> 26:39.848
IT LOOKED LIKE A GODDAMN
BAT'S WING, IT DID.

26:42.851 --> 26:46.354
COME TO WORK ABOUT 7:00
THAT NEXT MORNING,

26:46.354 --> 26:49.357
HEADED TO CHAT WITH CLAIRE
BEFORE HE WENT HOME,

26:49.357 --> 26:51.359
LIKE I ALWAYS DID.

26:51.359 --> 26:52.360
'MORNING !

26:54.362 --> 26:55.363
CLAIRE ?!

27:09.878 --> 27:12.881
( Ezra )
I GOTTA TELL YA...

27:12.881 --> 27:15.884
CLAIRE SEEMED A BIT
ODD THAT DAY...

27:15.884 --> 27:18.003
NOT QUITE HIMSELF.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.043
THIS SOME SORT OF
NEW SERVICE, CLAIRE ?

27:59.544 --> 28:00.545
CLAIRE ?

28:02.547 --> 28:05.050
JUST DOING 
MY PART IS ALL.

28:05.050 --> 28:08.436
SAW YOU HAD A 
NIGHT FLIER LAST NIGHT.

28:08.436 --> 28:09.938
THIS HIM ?

28:13.441 --> 28:14.442
YEAH.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.446
DWIGHT RENFIELD...

28:18.446 --> 28:20.949
FLEW IN 
FROM DERRY.

28:22.450 --> 28:24.953
NICE FELLA...

28:27.956 --> 28:29.457
DIFFERENT...

28:31.960 --> 28:34.963
SAID HE WAS 
LEAVING TONIGHT.

28:36.464 --> 28:39.968
SAID HE'D STOP BACK
TO SAY GOODBYE.

28:41.469 --> 28:44.973
( Ezra )
LOOKED LIKE 
HE CAME BACK ALRIGHT.

28:44.973 --> 28:47.976
CAN'T IMAGINE 
IT BEING ANYONE ELSE.

28:57.235 --> 29:00.739
CAME BACK AND RIPPED
MY FRIEND'S THROAT

29:00.739 --> 29:03.742
CLEAN OUT
FROM HIS NECK...

29:03.742 --> 29:06.745
AND LEFT HIM 
DEAD AS DIRT IN WINTER.

29:11.866 --> 29:14.369
UGLY WAY TO DIE.

29:14.369 --> 29:16.504
SO THE PLANE WAS THERE 
THE WHOLE DAY ?

29:16.504 --> 29:17.505
YEAH.

29:17.505 --> 29:20.008
DID CLAIRE MENTION 
CALLING A CAB

29:20.508 --> 29:23.011
FOR THE PILOT 
TO TAKE TO A MOTEL ?

29:23.011 --> 29:24.512
THERE DOESN'T 
SEEM TO BE ANY

29:24.512 --> 29:26.514
WITHIN 
WALKING DISTANCE.

29:26.514 --> 29:29.517
NO, I DON'T REMEMBER ABOUT
CLAIRE SAYING AWORD

29:29.517 --> 29:32.020
ABOUT CALLING
A FELLA A CAB.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.022
WHAT ABOUT 
A LIMO ?

29:34.272 --> 29:36.274
DIDN'T SAY NOTHIN'
ABOUT NO LIMO NEITHER.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.143
AND HE WOULD'VE 
MENTIONED THAT.

29:38.143 --> 29:40.145
CHECK TAXI,
LIMOUSINE SERVICES.

29:40.145 --> 29:42.397
SEEN ONE MORE 
THING, TOO.

29:42.397 --> 29:44.399
MIGHT NOT 
MEAN NOTHING,

29:44.399 --> 29:46.401
BUT THEN AGAIN 
IT MIGHT.

29:46.401 --> 29:48.903
STRUCKMEPECULIAR.

29:50.905 --> 29:52.657
SO GIVE...

29:52.657 --> 29:55.660
SEEN SOMETHING STRANGE 
UNDER THAT PLANE.

29:55.660 --> 29:56.661
I DID.

29:56.661 --> 29:58.163
TELL ME.

30:07.055 --> 30:09.557
BIG PILE OF DIRT

30:09.557 --> 30:12.060
RIGHT UNDER
THE LUGGAGE BAY IT WAS...

30:16.681 --> 30:18.566
NASTY STUFF,

30:18.566 --> 30:21.936
LIKE WHERE 
SOMETHING HAD DIED.

30:24.939 --> 30:27.442
YOU'RE GOING 
AFTER HIM,

30:27.442 --> 30:28.943
AIN'T YOU ?

30:30.078 --> 30:32.580
YOU BEST BE 
CAREFUL.

30:32.580 --> 30:34.582
THIS FELLA WHO
KILLED OLD CLAIRE,

30:35.083 --> 30:37.585
HE AIN'T NO MAN.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.090
THANKS FOR 
YOUR INPUT.

32:57.258 --> 32:59.143
NOT SCARY ENOUGH,
CLAIRE.

33:33.628 --> 33:35.763
( loud thundering )

33:59.404 --> 34:02.290
WHAT THE HELL 
ARE YOU DOING HERE, MISTER ?

34:02.540 --> 34:04.409
YOU SCARED THE SHIT
OUT OF ME, BUDDY !

34:08.413 --> 34:10.465
YOU DO THIS 
TO CLAIRE ?

34:11.966 --> 34:13.967
NO, I DIDN'T,

34:13.967 --> 34:16.721
BUT I THINK THE GUY WHO DID
JUST RAN THAT WAY.

34:16.721 --> 34:19.841
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE 
OR WHAT YOU WANT.

34:19.841 --> 34:21.842
WE RESPECT THE DEAD 
AROUND HERE, MISTER.

34:21.842 --> 34:24.094
I SUGGEST 
YOU DO THE SAME.

34:24.094 --> 34:26.597
YOU MIGHT BE JOINING CLAIRE
SOONER THAN YOUTHINK.

34:26.597 --> 34:27.598
REALLY.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.239
THANKS FOR 
THE ADVICE, TIGER.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.241
YOU'RE A REAL CREDIT 
TO HUMANITY.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.860
YOU'LL GET YOURS,
YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH !

34:40.360 --> 34:42.112
I ALREADY 
GOT IT.

34:57.678 --> 34:59.680
( thumping )

35:13.561 --> 35:15.062
( loud thump )

36:02.743 --> 36:05.246
I REALLY GOTTA DRINK
SOME MORE OF THAT SHIT.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.282
MUST'VE BEEN THAT KID
FROM THE CEMETERY

36:41.282 --> 36:43.284
AND HIS BOOZED UP 
BUDDIES

36:43.284 --> 36:45.286
EXERCISING THEIR
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS

36:45.286 --> 36:47.788
ON MY MOTEL ROOM WINDOW,
FUCKING HICKS.

36:47.788 --> 36:50.791
IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT MORE
THAN THAT TO SCARE ME OFF.

36:50.791 --> 36:55.296
I CHECKED OUT
EZRA HANNON'S STORY
WITH THE POLICE,

36:55.296 --> 36:58.165
THEY BACKED UP EVERYTHING 
THE OLD GIN-HEAD HAD TO SAY.

36:59.667 --> 37:01.669
THEN I CALLED
THE DERRY AIRPORT

37:01.669 --> 37:03.671
WHERE THIS NUT-BAR
SUPPOSEDLY FLEW OUT

37:03.671 --> 37:06.674
AND THEY NEVER HEARD OF
A DWIGHT RENFIELD

37:06.674 --> 37:08.676
OR A BLACK SKY MASTER
WITH THAT TAIL NUMBER.

37:08.676 --> 37:10.678
SO WHERE THE HELL 
DID HE COME FROM ?

37:11.178 --> 37:14.065
AND WHY DIDN'T CLAIRE QUESTION
HIS MISSING FLIGHT PLAN ?

37:16.317 --> 37:19.320
THESE LITTLE HICK AIRFIELDS
ARE ALWAYS USED BY DRUG RUNNERS

37:19.320 --> 37:21.822
TO TRANSPORT 
THEIR SHIT.

37:21.822 --> 37:24.325
IF THE FAA FOUND OUT
THAT CLAIRE BOWIE

37:24.325 --> 37:26.327
LET MR. RENFIELD
IN SO EASILY

37:26.327 --> 37:28.579
THEY'D SHUT HIM DOWN
FASTER THAN YOU CAN SAY

37:28.579 --> 37:30.698
"BUM-FUCK COUNTY.
MAINE".

37:32.199 --> 37:35.202
I GUESS CLAIRE DOESN'T 
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT NOW.

37:35.703 --> 37:38.706
ALDERTON, NEW YORK 
IS NEXT.

37:38.706 --> 37:40.708
SEE WHAT OTHER MISCHIEF
OUR CAPED CRUSADER

37:40.708 --> 37:42.460
GOT HIMSELF INTO.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.962
YOU MAY NOT 
KNOW IT YET, DWIGHT,

37:44.962 --> 37:47.965
BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE
MY ONE WAY TICKET 
BACK TO THE FRONT PAGE.

38:44.405 --> 38:46.407
( money shuffling )

38:46.407 --> 38:48.409
( man )
YOU'RE A VERY 
GENEROUS MAN, MR. DEES.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.879
( Richard )
ONLY WHEN 
I HAVE TO BE.

38:55.866 --> 38:58.369
MUST'VE BEEN A MIGHTY MAN
GOT BUCK KENDALL.

38:58.369 --> 39:00.871
GUY MUST'VE 
GOT HIM FROM BEHIND,

39:00.871 --> 39:02.373
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY 
I CAN FIGURE IT.

39:02.873 --> 39:04.375
WHY DO YOU 
SAY THAT ?

39:04.875 --> 39:07.378
BUCK WEIGHED
AROUND 220.

39:07.378 --> 39:08.879
AN EASY MAN
MOST OF THE TIME,

39:08.879 --> 39:10.881
GOD-FEARING 
CHRISTIAN.

39:10.881 --> 39:12.883
BUT IF YOU DID GET HIM RILED
HE MADE YOU SORRY.

39:13.384 --> 39:14.852
YOU GOT HERE 
RIGHT IN TIME.

39:14.852 --> 39:17.355
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO SEW HIM UP.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.696
DAMN THAT GLUE !

39:25.696 --> 39:27.698
I HOPE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
DURING THE WAKE.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.683
IS THIS WHAT
YOU WANTED TO SEE ?

39:30.151 --> 39:31.152
NO.

39:37.158 --> 39:38.659
THATIS.

40:25.172 --> 40:28.175
( Ezra on tape )
And he kept on washing
that damn plane.

40:28.175 --> 40:29.677
So I said,

40:29.677 --> 40:32.179
Saw you had 
a Night Flier last night.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.181
So I said,

40:34.682 --> 40:36.183
Saw you had
a Night Flier.

40:36.684 --> 40:38.686
Night Flier.

40:42.189 --> 40:44.692
NIGHT FLIER.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.195
SWEET.

40:59.206 --> 41:00.708
( phone ringing )

41:00.708 --> 41:02.710
( man )
This is Morton.

41:02.710 --> 41:04.211
IT'S DEES.

41:04.211 --> 41:05.713
WHEREAREYOU,
RICHARD ?

41:05.713 --> 41:07.214
ALDERTON, 
NEW YORK.

41:07.214 --> 41:08.716
Oh, Buck Kendall
territory.

41:08.716 --> 41:12.219
GOT MY PICTURE OF THE 
NIGHT FLIER'S SECOND VICTIM,

41:12.219 --> 41:13.721
UP CLOSE, PERSONAL 
AND DEAD.

41:13.721 --> 41:16.223
DON'T WORRY, HE'S OF AGE,
I CHECKED HIS I.D.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.226
WE'RE CALLIN' HIM
THE NIGHT FLIER NOW, NOT BAD.

41:19.226 --> 41:21.729
Mr. Renfield is not
your typical count.

41:21.729 --> 41:23.230
HOW'S THAT ?

41:23.230 --> 41:25.733
THERE WERE TWO BIG WOUNDS
ON KENDALL'S NECK.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.735
I'M NOT TALKING LITTLE
BELA LUGOSI BITE MARKS,

41:27.735 --> 41:30.237
I'M TALKING ABOUT 
MASSIVE HOLES.

41:30.237 --> 41:32.239
THIS GUY'S EITHER GOT TEETH
THE SIZE OF BIG FOOT

41:32.239 --> 41:33.741
OR HE'S RUNNING RAILROAD SPIKES
INTO THEIR NECKS.

41:34.241 --> 41:35.493
THIS IS GREAT SHIT !

41:35.493 --> 41:36.994
THE FATTIES IN
THE SUPERMARKET LINES

41:37.495 --> 41:38.996
ARE GONNA 
LOVE THIS GUY.

41:38.996 --> 41:41.499
GOD, I HOPE 
HE KILLS MORE PEOPLE !

41:41.499 --> 41:43.501
FAX ME YOUR COPY,
SEND THE PICTURES !

41:43.751 --> 41:45.753
KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS,
IT'S NOT READY YET.

41:45.753 --> 41:47.254
IT'S GONNA 
GET BIGGER.

41:47.254 --> 41:49.790
IT'S GONNA GET WEIRDER
I CAN FELL IT.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.425
SEND ME WHATEVER
THE HELL YOU GOT !

41:51.926 --> 41:54.428
WE ALREADY RAN THE TEASE, 
YOU KNOW THAT !

41:54.428 --> 41:56.931
IT'S NOT GONNA
BE READY FOR NEXT WEEK,

41:56.931 --> 41:58.432
YOU GOT THAT ?

41:58.432 --> 41:59.934
YOU'LL GET 
YOUR STORY

41:59.934 --> 42:01.936
when I decide it's time
to give it to you.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.938
IN THE MEANTIME STAY 
THE FUCK OUT OF MY FACE.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.940
I'M FLYING OUT OF
DUFFREY TOMORROW.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.943
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN
I THINK I HAVE SOMETHING.

42:11.946 --> 42:12.947
IDIOT.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.836
WORKING LATE ?

42:35.836 --> 42:38.339
JUST TRYING TO HIT 
THAT DEADLINE, BOSS.

42:38.839 --> 42:41.342
THE PSYCHIC DOGS OF THE STARS
PIECE IS REALLY TOUGH.

42:47.314 --> 42:49.817
WE'RE CALLING HIM THE
NIGHT FLIER NOW, BY THE WAY.

42:58.275 --> 43:00.778
I'M SORRY,
MR. MORRISON,

43:00.778 --> 43:02.780
I JUST COULDN'T 
LET IT GO.

43:02.780 --> 43:04.665
I'M NOT 
ASKING YOU TO.

43:04.665 --> 43:07.167
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND
ALL THE ANSWERS

43:07.167 --> 43:09.169
IN THIS ELECTRONIC
BOX OF YOURS.

43:09.169 --> 43:10.671
THEY'RE OUTTHERE.

43:11.171 --> 43:13.674
DO YOU WANT THIS STORY
BACK, KATHERINE ?

43:14.675 --> 43:16.677
YOU KNOW I DO.

43:17.177 --> 43:19.179
THEN TAPE THAT TICKET
OF YOURS BACK TOGETHER.

43:19.179 --> 43:21.181
DEES NOT RUN THIS PAPER,
IDO.

43:21.682 --> 43:23.684
BRING ME THE NIGHT FLIER
AND THE BYLINE'S YOURS.

43:23.684 --> 43:25.185
BUT I'LL
TELL YA SOMETHING,

43:25.185 --> 43:27.187
IF YOU WANNA 
BEAT DEES,

43:27.688 --> 43:30.190
YOU GOTTA PLAY
THE GAME LIKE DEES.

43:35.696 --> 43:36.697
YES.

43:51.795 --> 43:53.297
( sirens )

43:57.801 --> 43:58.802
SHIT !

44:21.191 --> 44:22.693
LOOKS LIKE 
BONUS DAY.

45:31.895 --> 45:33.397
MOVE IT ALONG, PAL.

45:33.397 --> 45:35.399
WE GOT ENOUGH 
PROBLEMS HERE.

45:40.270 --> 45:42.272
I SAID 
MOVE IT ALONG, BUDDY.

45:42.272 --> 45:44.274
GET YOUR HANDS 
OFF ME, PAL.

45:44.274 --> 45:46.026
I'M THE 
FUCKING PRESS !

45:46.026 --> 45:48.529
JUST DON'T GET
IN THE WAY, ALRIGHT ?

46:03.043 --> 46:06.547
BUCK KENDALL WAS
A ONE NIGHT STAND FOR YOU.

46:06.547 --> 46:10.050
YOU FLEW IN SHORTLY
AFTER 12:00 ON THE 23rd,

46:10.050 --> 46:12.052
SPIKED OL' BUCK DEAD

46:12.052 --> 46:14.555
AND TOOK OFF AGAIN
INTO THE UNFRIENDLY SKIES.

46:15.055 --> 46:18.058
THAT'S NOT THE NORM
FOR YOU, IS IT, PAL ?

46:18.058 --> 46:21.061
YOU LIKE TO LINGER.

46:21.061 --> 46:22.563
WHY ?

46:24.898 --> 46:27.284
MAYBE MOST TIMES YOU WAIT AROUND
UNTIL YOU'RE REALLY HUNGRY

46:27.785 --> 46:30.287
BUT POOR OL' BUCK
WAS A MIDNIGHT SNACK.

46:32.122 --> 46:34.625
YOU BEEN GETTING
UNDER MY SKIN, FELLA.

46:34.625 --> 46:38.128
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THIS STORY'S
ABOUT TO LET ME GO,

46:38.128 --> 46:41.381
THAT'S OKAY, 'CAUSE 
I'M NOT LETTING GO EITHER.

46:43.884 --> 46:46.887
IT'S FUNNY,
WHEN YOUGIVEBLOOD...

46:46.887 --> 46:50.390
THE MOST YOU CAN EXPECT
IS A CUP OF ORANGE JUICE.

46:54.895 --> 46:57.397
BUT WHEN YOUTAKEBLOOD,

46:57.898 --> 47:00.017
YOU GET HEADLINES.

47:02.519 --> 47:03.520
SICK FUCKER.

47:20.954 --> 47:22.956
FILL IT UP ?

47:22.956 --> 47:24.958
HIGH-TEST,
IF YOU PLEASE.

47:33.350 --> 47:35.853
I'M LOOKING FOR
THE DUFFREY AIRPORT.

47:36.353 --> 47:38.355
CAN YOU TELL ME 
HOW TO GET THERE ?

47:38.355 --> 47:39.473
SURE I COULD.

47:39.473 --> 47:41.975
AIN'T GONNA DO YOU NO GOOD,
THE PLACE IS CLOSED UP.

47:42.476 --> 47:43.977
I KNOW, I TRIED TO LAND THERE
THIS MORNING,

47:43.977 --> 47:45.979
HAD TO LAND IN 
WASHINGTON NATIONAL INSTEAD.

47:45.979 --> 47:47.981
THEN YOU MUST KNOW
ABOUT THE SARCHES.

47:48.482 --> 47:49.983
THAT'S WHY 
I'M HERE.

47:49.983 --> 47:52.986
TRYIN' TO FIND OUT 
MORE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

47:52.986 --> 47:54.872
YOU A COP 
OR SOMETHING ?

47:54.872 --> 47:57.374
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

47:57.374 --> 47:59.243
SO YOU KNEW
THE SARCHES ?

47:59.743 --> 48:01.245
HELL, YEAH,
I KNEW 'EM.

48:01.245 --> 48:04.248
ACTUALLY SAW RAY AND HIS WIFE
THE DAY THEY WERE MURDERED.

48:04.248 --> 48:07.751
THEY STOPPED IN HERE ON
THE WAY HOME THAT AFTERNOON.

48:07.751 --> 48:10.254
I COULD TELL RIGHT AWAY THERE
WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM.

48:10.254 --> 48:11.755
WHAT DO 
YOU MEAN ?

48:12.256 --> 48:14.258
RAY LOOKED ALL
TIRED AND PALE

48:14.258 --> 48:16.260
LIKE HE WAS
SICK OR SOMETHING.

48:16.260 --> 48:18.262
BUT, ELLEN,
SHE WAS LOOKING FINE.

48:18.262 --> 48:20.264
I ALMOST DIDN'T 
RECOGNIZE HER.

48:20.264 --> 48:23.267
LET'S GO, RAY.

48:23.267 --> 48:25.269
HONEY.

48:25.269 --> 48:28.272
HE'S WAITING 
FOR US.

48:33.277 --> 48:36.280
SELIDA DONE ELLEN UP
REAL GOOD.

48:36.280 --> 48:37.781
WHO ?

48:37.781 --> 48:38.782
SELIDA McCAMON.

48:39.283 --> 48:41.285
SHE WORKS OVER IN TOWN
AT THE BEAUTY BAR.

48:41.285 --> 48:43.287
THAT'S SOMEBODY
YOU SHOULD BE TALKING TO.

48:43.787 --> 48:46.290
SHE BEEN PASSING ALONG SOME
MIGHTY STRANGE STORIES SHE HAS.

48:48.292 --> 48:51.795
( Richard )
DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY ?

48:52.296 --> 48:54.798
JUST THE FACT 
THAT ELLEN'S VISITS

48:54.798 --> 48:57.301
WERE USUALLY AS REGULAR
AS CLOCKWORK.

48:57.801 --> 49:00.804
AND THIS TIME SHE CAME IN
AT LEAST TWO WEEKS EARLY.

49:00.804 --> 49:03.307
THAT MIGHT NOT MEAN 
ANYTHING TOYOU.

49:03.307 --> 49:05.309
BUT FOR ELLEN SARCH
TO BREAK A ROUTINE

49:05.809 --> 49:08.312
SHE'D BEEN FOLLOWING
FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS,

49:08.312 --> 49:10.314
IT WAS 
DOWNRIGHT ODD.

49:10.314 --> 49:11.448
HOW DID ELLEN
SEEM TO YOU ?

49:11.949 --> 49:14.952
DREAMY SOMEHOW.

49:14.952 --> 49:17.454
LIKE A SCHOOLGIRL
WITH A CRUSH.

49:17.454 --> 49:19.957
62 YEARS OLD OR NOT,

49:19.957 --> 49:24.962
HER COLOR WAS SO HIGH
I THOUGHT IT WAS MAKEUP.

49:24.962 --> 49:28.215
WILL IT 
BE THE USUAL, EL ?

49:30.717 --> 49:32.219
NO.

49:33.220 --> 49:36.723
SOMETHING DIFFERENT
THIS TIME.

49:36.723 --> 49:39.726
A PERM, I THINK.

49:40.727 --> 49:42.729
AND MAYBE...

49:43.230 --> 49:46.233
A LITTLE BIT
OF COLOR TOO.

49:46.233 --> 49:48.735
AND AS I 
WORKED ON HER,

49:48.735 --> 49:52.356
ELLEN TOLD ME ABOUT THAT PILOT
WHO FLEW IN THE NIGHT BEFORE.

49:52.356 --> 49:54.358
I KNEW THEY'D 
NEVER MET HIM.

49:54.858 --> 49:56.994
BY THE WAY 
SHEWAS TALKING

49:56.994 --> 49:59.496
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS
A LONG LOST FRIEND.

49:59.997 --> 50:01.999
RAY AND ELLEN WELCOMED HIM
WITH OPEN ARMS

50:02.499 --> 50:04.001
INTO THEIR HOME.

50:04.001 --> 50:05.502
THEY EVEN 
HAD DINNER,

50:05.502 --> 50:07.504
ACTUALLY WATCHED 
A LITTLE TELEVISION.

50:07.504 --> 50:10.507
THE NEXT MORNING
ELLEN CAME TO SEE ME.

50:13.010 --> 50:15.012
SHE WANTED 
TO LOOK SENSUOUS.

50:17.014 --> 50:20.017
SHE WANTED 
TO LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

50:22.019 --> 50:25.022
SHE WANTED 
TO LOOK YOUNG.

50:25.022 --> 50:27.274
COULD YOU LOOK 
THIS WAY, PLEASE ?

50:27.274 --> 50:29.026
THANKS, HON.

50:30.027 --> 50:33.530
( cop )
WHEN YOU FBI BOYS
FIND THIS SON-OF-A-BITCH

50:33.530 --> 50:36.533
GIVE HIM A SWIFT KICK
IN THE TEETH FOR ME.

50:36.533 --> 50:38.535
RAY AND ELLEN
WERE GOOD PEOPLE.

50:38.535 --> 50:41.538
TELL ME ABOUT 
THE MURDERS.

50:41.538 --> 50:44.541
TELL ME ABOUT WHAT 
YOU FOUND AT THE TRAILER.

50:44.541 --> 50:48.045
NOTHIN' LOOKED OUT OF
THE ORDINARY AT FIRST...

50:48.545 --> 50:50.547
'TILL WE 
STEPPED INSIDE...

51:10.650 --> 51:14.154
( cop )
RIGHT AWAY WE KNEW 
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

51:14.654 --> 51:16.656
IT WAS THE SMELL...

51:48.355 --> 51:50.857
WE FOUND 
RAY FIRST,

51:51.224 --> 51:52.726
SPRAWLED OUT 
AT OUR FEET...

51:59.232 --> 52:01.985
HARDLY ANY BLOOD
ON HIM AT ALL...

52:03.487 --> 52:05.989
SOMETHING ELSE
WAS MISSING TOO.

52:05.989 --> 52:07.991
( Richard )
WHAT'S THAT ?

52:07.991 --> 52:10.494
( cop )
HIS HEAD.

52:11.745 --> 52:14.748
IT WAS SITTING OVER IN 
THE FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM,

52:14.748 --> 52:17.250
STARING TOWARD 
THE OPEN DOORWAY.

52:17.250 --> 52:20.754
AS IF THERE WERE 
ACTUALLY SOMETHING TO SEE.

52:20.754 --> 52:23.890
NEVER SEEN NOTHING 
LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE.

52:23.890 --> 52:27.761
AN FAA WARNING FOR THIS GUY 
WAS POSTED ON THE WALL.

52:27.761 --> 52:30.764
AND HE WAS THERE ALL NIGHT,
AND ALL THE NEXT DAY,

52:30.764 --> 52:33.767
AND STILL THEY DIDN'T
BLOW THE WHISTLE ON HIM.

52:33.767 --> 52:36.903
IT JUST 
MAKES NO SENSE...

52:47.414 --> 52:49.416
POOR ELLEN.

52:49.416 --> 52:52.419
I CAN STILL 
SEE HER NOW.

52:53.787 --> 52:56.790
SHE WAS LYING THERE
PALE AS SNOW.

52:56.790 --> 53:00.243
EVERY DROP OF
HER BLOOD GONE TOO.

53:00.243 --> 53:03.296
BUT GODDAMN IF SHE
DIDN'T LOOK AT PEACE.

53:03.296 --> 53:06.383
ALMOST HAPPY, LIKE IT
WAS WHAT SHE WANTED.

53:06.383 --> 53:08.635
( Richard )
WERE THERE ANY STRANGE PUNCTURE
MARKS ON THEIR BODIES ?

53:08.635 --> 53:10.136
HOLES ?

53:10.270 --> 53:12.272
( cop )
THERE WERE HOLES
ALL RIGHT.

53:12.272 --> 53:14.558
HOLES BIG ENOUGH
YOU COULD SIPHON FROM.

53:14.691 --> 53:16.193
WHICH IS WHAT
WE FIGURED HE DID.

53:16.693 --> 53:18.695
HOW HE DIDN'T SPLASH BLOOD 
ALL OVER THE ROOM

53:18.695 --> 53:20.697
IS ANYBODY'S 
GUESS.

53:22.199 --> 53:25.702
WHAT KIND OF FUCKING GAME
IS THIS ANIMAL PLAYING ?

53:26.203 --> 53:28.705
I WISH SOMEBODY
WOULD TELL ME THAT.

53:48.091 --> 53:50.977
( fierce growling )

54:04.357 --> 54:05.859
NICE PUPPY.

54:07.360 --> 54:09.362
THAT'S A 
GOOD BOY.

54:11.615 --> 54:14.868
I DON'T FUCKING
BELIEVE THISSHIT.

55:02.799 --> 55:03.917
( horn blowing )

55:23.436 --> 55:25.438
( Richard )
THE BLOOD STOPS HERE,

55:25.438 --> 55:27.941
UNTIL DWIGHT SPIKES AGAIN,
THE TRIAL'S COLD.

55:27.941 --> 55:30.694
( Morrison )
Anything new
in Duffrey ?

55:30.694 --> 55:33.196
Richard,
you still there ?

55:33.196 --> 55:35.699
NO, IT'S MORE
OF THE SAME.

55:35.699 --> 55:39.202
THIS MANIAC DEFINITELY HAS 
AN INFLUENCE OVER THESE PEOPLE.

55:39.202 --> 55:41.204
A LOT OF SERIAL KILLERS
CAN CHARM THEIR VICTIMS,

55:41.705 --> 55:43.707
BUT THIS GUY'S
GOT IT IN SPADES.

55:43.707 --> 55:45.709
Did you pack 
your garlic ?

55:45.709 --> 55:48.712
YEAH, RIGHT NEXT TO
MY CRUCIFIX.

55:48.712 --> 55:51.214
IT'S TIME TO HIT THE PHONES, 
I NEED TO FIND THAT PLANE.

55:51.214 --> 55:53.717
IF ANYTHING COMES OVER THE WIRES
GIVE ME A CALL.

55:53.717 --> 55:55.719
I'M STAYING AT 
THE FALLING STAR MOTEL.

55:55.719 --> 55:57.220
YOU GOT IT.

55:59.222 --> 56:01.725
WHEN HELL 
FREEZES OVER.

56:01.725 --> 56:03.727
SORRY TO KEEP YOU
HOLDING, KATHERINE.

56:04.227 --> 56:06.730
( Katherine )
I don't feel comfortable
bribing police officers.

56:07.230 --> 56:10.233
IT TAKES PRACTICE,
YOU'LL GET THE HANG OF IT.

56:10.233 --> 56:12.235
Yeah, I guess so.

56:12.235 --> 56:14.738
WHERE ARE YOU STAYING
IN CASE I NEED YOU ?

56:14.738 --> 56:17.741
The Falling Star Motel,
room 134.

56:18.241 --> 56:19.242
YEAH ?

56:20.744 --> 56:22.746
I HEAR IT'S
A PRETTY NICE PLACE.

56:23.246 --> 56:25.248
GOOD LUCK,
KATHERINE.

56:25.248 --> 56:26.249
Thanks.

56:31.254 --> 56:34.257
GOD, I LOVE 
THIS JOB.

56:38.261 --> 56:40.263
( hysterical laughing )

56:49.189 --> 56:50.690
EXCUSE ME.

56:54.444 --> 56:56.946
HARD DAY ?

56:58.832 --> 57:01.367
HARD LIFE.

57:29.529 --> 57:31.531
YOU'RE NEXT,
DWIGHT.

57:37.320 --> 57:39.823
WHAT'S THIS SHIT ?

57:39.823 --> 57:42.575
YOUR FRIEND AT THE END OF 
THE BAR ORDERED IT FOR YOU.

57:45.078 --> 57:46.579
THAT'SFUNNY.

57:46.579 --> 57:49.582
HE WAS JUST THERE
A SECOND AGO.

58:00.393 --> 58:02.145
WHAT DID 
HE LOOK LIKE ?

58:02.145 --> 58:03.646
COULDN'T TELL,

58:03.646 --> 58:05.648
HE WAS ALL DRESSED UP 
FOR HALLOWEEN OR SOMETHING !

58:05.648 --> 58:06.649
WHAT'D HE SAY ?!

58:07.150 --> 58:08.151
JUST TO BRING YOU
THE DRINK.

58:08.651 --> 58:09.519
WHERE'D HE GO ?!

58:10.019 --> 58:11.020
I DON'T KNOW !

58:24.868 --> 58:26.369
MISTER, 
BACK OFF !

58:27.370 --> 58:28.872
( flapping sound )

58:42.268 --> 58:44.270
FUCK YOU, DWIGHT !

58:44.270 --> 58:46.773
I'M NOT STOPPING,
FUCK YOU !

59:11.898 --> 59:13.900
OH, MY GOD.

59:13.900 --> 59:15.535
DEES.

59:20.657 --> 59:23.159
WHAT THEFUCK 
ARE YOU DOING HERE ?

59:23.159 --> 59:25.161
TAKING BACK 
MY STORY.

59:25.161 --> 59:26.663
MORRISON PUT YOU 
UP TO THIS ?

59:26.663 --> 59:28.798
I DON'T SEE WHAT THAT
HAS TO DO WITH ANYTHING.

59:28.798 --> 59:30.300
MORRISON SENT YOU DOWN HERE
TO PISS ME OFF.

59:30.800 --> 59:31.801
HE'S FUCKIN'
WITH YOU.

59:32.302 --> 59:33.303
I DON'T 
BELIEVE YOU.

59:33.303 --> 59:35.305
I DON'T 
GIVE A FUCK !

59:35.305 --> 59:38.808
GO ON HOME BEFORE
YOU REALLY MAKE ME MAD.

59:39.309 --> 59:41.311
I DON'T NEED
SOME BITCH CUB REPORTER
SCREWING UP MY LEADS.

59:41.811 --> 59:45.315
I DON'T NEED YOUR LEADS, 
I HAVE MY OWN.

59:45.315 --> 59:46.816
IS THAT RIGHT ?

59:46.816 --> 59:47.817
MM-HMM.

59:47.817 --> 59:49.819
I HAVE A COMPLETE SET
OF POLICE REPORTS

59:49.819 --> 59:51.321
FROM THE CUMBERLAND COUNTY'S
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

59:51.321 --> 59:53.323
I TRACKED DOWN A VERY
COOPERATIVE CLERK

59:53.323 --> 59:55.325
FROM THE FAA OFFICES 
IN WASHINGTON.

59:55.325 --> 59:58.328
AND I HAVE ALL THREE SETS
OF AUTOPSY PHOTOS !

59:58.328 --> 01:00:02.315
LIKE I SAID, I'M TAKING
THIS STORY HOME.

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:03.833
NO.

01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:05.835
YOU'RE JUST 
PLAYING CATCH-UP.

01:00:06.319 --> 01:00:08.338
WHAT ARE YOU 
GONNA DO NEXT ?

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:11.207
I HAVE MY IDEAS.

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:12.208
WHERE YOU GOING ?

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:14.344
WAIT, WE'RE 
TALKING HERE.

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:17.847
JIMMY, WHY DON'T WE CUT THIS
COMPETITION BULLSHIT ?

01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:19.849
YOU WANT ME TO
TELL YOU THE TRUTH ?

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:21.351
I'M DRY.

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:24.337
SO ARE YOU,
RIGHT ?

01:00:24.337 --> 01:00:26.856
DWIGHT WAS HERE,
HE JUST LEFT.

01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:29.108
HE'S FLYING
RIGHT THIS MINUTE,

01:00:29.108 --> 01:00:31.110
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO COME DOWN
SOONER OR LATER.

01:00:31.611 --> 01:00:33.613
HE'S BEEN VERY LUCKY 
THREE TIMES ALREADY.

01:00:33.613 --> 01:00:35.615
HOW MANY MORE TIMES YOU THINK
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

01:00:36.115 --> 01:00:37.617
BEFORE THIS STORY 
BREAKS WIDE OPEN

01:00:37.617 --> 01:00:40.620
AND WE LOSE HIM 
FOR GOOD ?

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.122
YEAH, SO,
WHAT'S YOUR POINT ?

01:00:43.122 --> 01:00:44.624
MY POINT IS THIS...

01:00:44.624 --> 01:00:47.126
WE GOTTA GET A LEAD
ON THIS GUY SOON

01:00:47.126 --> 01:00:49.128
OR WE'RE FUCKED.

01:00:49.128 --> 01:00:52.632
TWO PEOPLE CAN DO THAT 
KIND OF WORK FASTER THAN ONE.

01:00:54.133 --> 01:00:56.135
I'LL TELL YOU 
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

01:00:56.135 --> 01:00:59.639
THIS IS THE BEST DEAL 
YOU HAD ALL DAY.

01:00:59.639 --> 01:01:02.141
IF YOU WORK WITH ME 
ON THIS...

01:01:02.608 --> 01:01:05.094
I'LL SHARE
MY BYLINE.

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:11.601
HOWVERY 
GENEROUS OF YOU.

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:13.102
YOU LAUGH.

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:15.104
YES, I DO.

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:17.106
IT'S AS GOOD 
AS IT GETS, BABY.

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:18.574
THE TRUTH IS,

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:21.577
IF IT COMES DOWN
TO JUST ME OR JUST YOU,

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:23.579
IT'S GONNA BE ME

01:01:23.579 --> 01:01:25.581
ALL THE WAY.

01:01:30.586 --> 01:01:32.588
SO WHAT 
DO YOU THINK ?

01:01:37.543 --> 01:01:40.046
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I NEED TO KNOW FROM YOU.

01:01:40.046 --> 01:01:42.048
IT'S 1-0-1,
BRAVO LIMA.

01:01:42.548 --> 01:01:45.935

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:51.808

YES, I'LL HOLD.

01:02:01.067 --> 01:02:03.069
NO, I WON'T HOLD.

01:02:20.586 --> 01:02:24.090
HIS NAME IS 
DWIGHT RENFIELD.

01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:26.092

01:02:27.727 --> 01:02:29.729

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:47.497
HELL, NO.

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:52.001
WHAT ABOUT THAT ?

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:55.121
HE'S NOT GONNA HIT WILMINGTON,
IT'S WAY TOO BIG.

01:02:55.121 --> 01:02:56.622
UH-HUH.

01:03:03.629 --> 01:03:05.631

Always interested in helping
the FAA any way possible.

01:03:16.642 --> 01:03:18.778
What can I 
do for you ?

01:03:19.278 --> 01:03:21.280

THESE STORIES

01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:11.450
THEY CAN CREEP INSIDE

01:06:11.951 --> 01:06:13.953
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU

01:06:13.953 --> 01:06:16.956

LOOK OUT, LADIES

A VERY BAD MAN 
IS COMING YOUR WAY.

01:07:03.335 --> 01:07:05.337
YOU'LL READ HIS REAL NAME
AND FORGET IT.

01:07:05.337 --> 01:07:06.839
BUT THAT'S OKAY,

01:07:06.839 --> 01:07:09.341
BECAUSE YOU'LL REMEMBER 
MYNAME FOR HIM.

01:07:09.341 --> 01:07:11.844
A NAME THAT'S GONNA PUT HIM

TORSO MURDERER

01:07:13.846 --> 01:07:15.347
AND THE BLACK DAHLIA.

01:07:15.848 --> 01:07:18.851
