03:32.421 --> 03:35.505
Speaking of information.
I know why I'm here, but ...

03:36.341 --> 03:38.990
You guys can not yet
all have won.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.093
What's coming then
here at this rally?

03:43.974 --> 03:46.540
Can I get a bit
Ask attention?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.927
I believe,
I can answer all your questions.

03:49.479 --> 03:52.017
First of all:
Welcome.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.881
Hi! - Hi!
- On behalf of Winfree,

03:54.901 --> 03:59.094
the brand new download service
for cutting-edge, international films.

03:59.114 --> 04:02.107
My name is Maureen.
I'm the housekeeper.

04:02.743 --> 04:06.727
You've already seen me in the clip,
in which the winners have been notified.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.455
First, I say to each
of you briefly what. Charles ...

04:10.167 --> 04:13.751
You are interested in
Technology and Computer.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.610
A little.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.946
Okay.
And Johnny, you are very athletic.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.156
Yes, ma'am.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.908
Vincent, a medical student, right?
- Correct.

04:21.928 --> 04:26.079
Toll! Lola, you know by now, if you
want to make your Master? - Not yet.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.707
Maggie,
how's your clothing line?

04:28.727 --> 04:31.460
Fantastic.
Would you like safely.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.212
And Jenna, I am pleased,
that you care for a few days

04:34.232 --> 04:35.881
from your teacher
free might.

04:35.901 --> 04:39.217
Now, you see, we have
a little research operated.

04:39.237 --> 04:42.721
As a precondition to you
to invite in the Beach House.

04:42.741 --> 04:46.516
My job is, you stay
to make as pleasant as possible.

04:46.536 --> 04:50.729
As the winner of all your costs are covered
and you have the whole house.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.273
You can watch freely
the refrigerator and the bar operate.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.860
Also you have access to the pool,
the barbecue, all sports equipment

04:56.880 --> 05:01.281
and one of the most beautiful private beaches,
has to offer to our country.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.074
For a whole week.

05:03.094 --> 05:07.454
Two rules. First:
This is really for each of you.

05:07.474 --> 05:11.684
If one of you home earlier
want to go, then you must all go.

05:12.729 --> 05:13.877
Secondly:

05:13.897 --> 05:16.389
Nobody goes into the sea
after nightfall.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.686
Well then, if you still
have any questions, ask me.

05:21.196 --> 05:25.639
Everything, what you should know about the beach,
Joe tells you, the lifeguard.

05:25.659 --> 05:29.869
You can find him from sunrise to
Sunset in his station on the beach.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.901
So much for the rules.
Do you still have any questions?

05:37.921 --> 05:40.880
Well, the allocation of rooms
depends on the bulletin board.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.908
All right. - I would say,
we bring our luggage to the room

05:44.928 --> 05:48.829
and head to the bar,
as long as the hot tub heats. And off!

05:48.849 --> 05:51.136
Since I'm in.
- I've heard bar?

05:51.726 --> 05:55.686
That's what I call "très chique".
Here's can withstand up. - Wow!

06:04.030 --> 06:08.223
So, unfortunately, I still do not know,
which bikini to wear.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.559
If you have multiple doing?
- Yes it is.

06:10.579 --> 06:13.270
I like the purple.
- To me or to you?

06:13.290 --> 06:15.939
Really?
- Yes, I have designed.

06:15.959 --> 06:20.110
These are all sample parts.
And that's perfect now, to try them.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.196
Yes. - Your steamer trunk
is still around in the way.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.115
Oh ...
Yes, I imagine it away later.

06:25.135 --> 06:28.201
Age, look,
This is the bedroom of the women.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.759
What?
- You can see everything in detail.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.540
Charlie, you're
really a tensioner, man.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.959
It forces you no mitzugucken.

06:35.979 --> 06:39.462
So I want. - Me too.
But Depends which undresses.

06:39.482 --> 06:43.226
So, ladies, come on,
always nice to get out of the clothes.

06:44.696 --> 06:47.679
Now making a
after another naked.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.890
Very beautiful.
There you are. Keep it up.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.994
Wait.
Before you go forth what, wait. - Why?

06:53.455 --> 06:56.187
Perhaps here,
just like in these reality shows,

06:56.207 --> 06:58.290
any hidden cameras.

06:59.210 --> 07:02.611
I have in this computer freak
a really strange feeling.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.529
I do not trust.
- There is something on that.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.699
The was also a long time
in the house in front of us. - Precisely. - And ...

07:07.719 --> 07:11.828
I do not know how you stand to
but I do not let me film determined.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.885
I have an app
on my phone.

07:14.559 --> 07:18.460
The automatically recognizes the frequencies
by all camera models. - Really?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.754
Yes, if there are cameras here
we notice that.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.006
What are they doing there?
- Who cares?

07:23.026 --> 07:24.392
But wait a minute ...

07:25.487 --> 07:26.773
What was that?

07:28.406 --> 07:31.014
There is a camera.
Certainly. - Really?

07:31.034 --> 07:33.516
Okay.
- And she's turned on at the moment.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.493
These perverts
Watch us straight.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.829
These Lola-brat is really hot.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.944
But if we report,
might send us home all.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.832
No. It's out of the question.
We're barely here. - Okay.

07:47.092 --> 07:50.825
We have a plan and only,
then to avenge us. - Okay.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.161
Sounds great.
You know what?

07:53.181 --> 07:55.830
If the want to clamp,
we will give them what to tension.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.809
The will
still surprised. Music, please. - Okay.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.850
Wow, cool thing.
Maggie, what a show.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.561
Are they in reality strippers?
- No idea.

08:18.581 --> 08:22.450
Just as moving are the
perhaps supermodels or so.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.329
Real juicy and plump.
Guys, this is indeed so hot here.

08:29.217 --> 08:32.176
The thinking determines
we would always do.

08:36.182 --> 08:40.142
Take off you. But not give them
the full program. That they do not get.

08:44.733 --> 08:48.272
Real beautiful mares.
- Yes man. Krass.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.236
Damn it.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.306
Hey, Hypno-Boy.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.600
Are you on reception?
Earth to Vincent.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.102
Total kicked off.

08:59.122 --> 09:03.440
Only that it's you know, not a bad word
about Jenna. Otherwise I'm going to kill you.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.827
No, whence?
I am focussing more on Maggie.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.872
No, ah northeast.
- What's going on at once?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.665
Is only just
become interesting.

09:20.685 --> 09:21.641
Well, sorry, guys.

09:24.814 --> 09:29.132
They strapped that we sit and watch.
- Vincent, excellently observed.

09:29.152 --> 09:32.218
The finger I had
almost overlooked. - That's not good.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.722
Gentlemen, not good. - At least
I can rewind the recording

09:35.742 --> 09:37.724
and all over again
run from the front.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.282
But then you do not want
be in the room, because ...

09:41.664 --> 09:44.189
But if you want, then remain.
- No I do not want this.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.523
A second hand
can I always need.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.358
I am happy,
if I may leave the room.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.944
I plan an interesting technique.
- We'll just go out.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.581
We will treat your privacy.
- Scratch you a calm.

10:38.513 --> 10:40.129
The makes me crazy.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.639
Which one?
- Maggie, the brunette.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.294
The area is hot.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.464
But actually, I have to say,
all of which are of the finest quality.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.272
This is really frustrating.
I'm just air for them.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.608
Then you must
not change what, kid.

10:58.658 --> 11:02.892
Man, do not misunderstand. But I
take of an old lifeguard

11:02.912 --> 11:06.280
but no advice
in matters of love. - Very friendly.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.774
Then I'll times
verklickern two things. First:

11:09.794 --> 11:12.026
I have a trunk
like a baby elephant.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.834
Hello, My Big,
you have plenty of room in there?

11:15.592 --> 11:20.160
Second: The talk about
that it would not arrive on the size,

11:20.180 --> 11:23.329
is a huge bullshit.
Can you fully depreciate.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.249
Look at me. You have to admit,
I look damn good.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.918
Am well built,
Class complexion and so on.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.171
I have in my
Lifeguard house just wait

11:31.191 --> 11:33.089
they come to me automatically.

11:33.109 --> 11:37.677
I also add very much that I
have already saved many relationships.

11:37.697 --> 11:42.599
If I'm not even in it over there,
Then I push myself as a marriage counselor.

11:42.619 --> 11:47.020
Dr. Joe, the lifeguard,
Slash marriage counselor, at your service.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.857
You kidding me yet. - With what?
So that I am a marriage counselor? - No.

11:50.877 --> 11:55.153
But I just do not think you
the women fly on its own, man.

11:55.173 --> 11:58.406
I swear that's true.
No shit, buddy.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.951
But if I am to be honest,
it is not enough that you want them.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.870
You must namely
want to have you.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.789
And how do I do that?
Tell me that. - Okay.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.167
Then listen well.
I'll tell you this only once.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.669
Go down to the harbor
Get a candle.

12:11.689 --> 12:15.381
And so you stand easy
tonight at her bedroom window.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.258
But do not get too close, get it?

12:17.278 --> 12:21.471
Perhaps she finds it but shit.
Are you really sure?

12:21.491 --> 12:25.058
I tell you, stand at the window, okay?
With your candle.

12:25.078 --> 12:29.368
Unselfish you keep vigil.
In any weather.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.874
Wow! - Cool.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.303
The Hammer.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.149
All right.
Shall We Dance?

13:15.044 --> 13:17.001
Do not be shy.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.757
Good night, ladies.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.467
Good night.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.760
What was that?
- A seal or so.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.897
Well, do I sign out.

13:41.571 --> 13:45.888
So, we'll see you tomorrow morning.
Good night, ladies.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.865
Good night.
- What about your jacket?

13:48.328 --> 13:52.288
Keep them. It reflects.
So I recognize you in the dark.

14:10.975 --> 14:14.013
May I keep you company?
- Sure, come on in.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.211
That's the Pleasant
at my job.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.672
In addition, I am learning
always know cool people.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.591
What exactly are you doing?

14:21.611 --> 14:24.010
I do not know
where to start.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.762
The manager.

14:25.782 --> 14:30.475
Sometimes I cook
or yoga teacher or tour guide.

14:30.495 --> 14:34.270
Girlfriend, if someone needs a.
- I'd like to do but have not yoga.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.315
Seven clock tomorrow morning.
In all its freshness. - Ouch!

14:37.335 --> 14:39.567
And when does the second hour?

14:39.587 --> 14:42.204
Only to be number two,
you're accustomed.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.206
Very funny.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.795
That was a splash.

14:57.271 --> 15:00.338
I like the prelude.
Especially if he knows what he's doing.

15:00.358 --> 15:01.644
Yes, great.

15:02.610 --> 15:06.274
Okay, so,
I must confess to you what.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.233
I've never really done.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.935
Hey, I can muck, myself.

15:13.955 --> 15:17.397
Already clear.
I make the guys pretty sharp.

15:17.417 --> 15:22.276
But I was very conservative upbringing.
So, after all. I'm still virgin.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.112
But that's okay for me.

15:24.132 --> 15:28.001
Everything else I've done.
No shit, everything.

15:28.678 --> 15:32.388
Want to wait until the wedding?
- No. That's not it.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.789
For the right person happens's.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.641
What are you waiting, Lola?

15:36.853 --> 15:41.045
At a friend, a lover,
a married types, an ax murderer?

15:41.065 --> 15:43.853
So, if I'm honest,
I've never been in love.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.193
I do not even know
how love feels.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.846
Can you tell me that?

15:49.866 --> 15:51.573
I can try.

15:53.494 --> 15:58.990
I might even say,
that love and I are old friends.

15:59.333 --> 16:03.293
Anyway, there is nothing better,
as the feeling of love or ...

16:05.423 --> 16:08.791
... The feeling in someone
really love to be.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.845
I guess,
does not help me.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.264
Only patience.
That will come.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.876
Well, I think,
I'm going in now.

16:19.896 --> 16:23.754
Or I'll go walk on the beach.
I can not decide anyway.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.391
So to me
now waiting for my bed.

16:26.861 --> 16:31.512
I have, in the middle
at night a yoga class.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.024
Me too.
- Thank you for the good conversation, Maureen.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.432
Come on out!

17:10.946 --> 17:12.813
Come out! Is okay!

17:21.832 --> 17:24.118
I'm sorry,
if I scared you.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.455
I have looked at Maggie.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.917
She looks damn good.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.251
But you're not bad either.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.389
You can indeed look calm.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.431
Did you her already said?

17:44.063 --> 17:45.770
I could never do.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.381
Hey, never say never.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.269
If you hire the right,
makes you go that way already.

and we survived it. - Toll!

37:28.747 --> 37:32.772
Probably, it is already online,
if I judge this Lola properly.

37:32.792 --> 37:36.251
If they want war,
then she gets him.

37:36.755 --> 37:40.071
Hey, dude, so I do not think
that it has put online.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.449
Get your easy loose.
Funny is funny.

37:42.469 --> 37:45.994
You've got the fucking camera in their
Room hidden. Have you started.

37:46.014 --> 37:47.370
That's not the same.

37:47.390 --> 37:50.957
We must make it clear to them,
that they have gone too far.

37:50.977 --> 37:54.919
Because maybe I get
Reparation sex of Maggie.

37:54.939 --> 37:57.589
Or maybe as
Excuse me a video.

37:57.609 --> 38:01.009
So one that I then me alone
can look at in my spare time.

38:01.029 --> 38:02.927
I give myself even
satisfied with a photo.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.233
I'm a likeable guy.

38:06.242 --> 38:07.358

38:11.206 --> 38:13.521
I'm sorry, honestly.

38:13.541 --> 38:15.828
Us does it quite the same suffering.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.444
That was mean.
- I had no idea.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.626
Honestly not.
Otherwise I would have warned you.

38:45.073 --> 38:46.554

39:02.382 --> 39:04.749
No,
So I can not say.

39:06.302 --> 39:09.841
You're doing a great noise.
- Hey, so please. We walk a bit.

39:14.727 --> 39:17.344
Do you think you already
Nasties from?

39:18.314 --> 39:24.384
Well, to be honest, we are ashamed
all of us for what we have done.

39:24.404 --> 39:27.345
Even Jenna, although they
has it knew nothing.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.348
We will prepare you
We are sorry for dinner.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.735

delicious Thai food.

39:32.954 --> 39:36.354

39:40.670 --> 39:44.129
Please, please, please,
Accept the apology.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.952
Well, I suppose they,
but that only applies to me.

39:50.972 --> 39:54.163
With Charlie and Vincent
you will still need to talk.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.498
Sure, of course.

39:55.518 --> 39:56.804
Good.

40:01.816 --> 40:06.009
I think Johnny is a very honest
and pretty nice boy.

40:06.029 --> 40:09.512
And he looks good enough to eat,
have you not noticed.

40:09.532 --> 40:13.850
That just adds properly. - Displays Lola,
"That does not know how love feels,"

40:13.870 --> 40:16.227
about interest
the opposite sex?

40:16.247 --> 40:19.365
I just said,
He's a nice guy and no more.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.662
You know what?

40:23.296 --> 40:26.946
I ventured enough
to know that when someone says:

40:26.966 --> 40:30.255
and no more,
which actually means the opposite.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.829
You tolerate anyway
no contradiction.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.998
So what.

40:37.018 --> 40:40.585
<I> ♪ Lola loves Johnny!
Lola loves Johnny! </ I>

40:40.605 --> 40:42.837
Stop!
He might hear you yet.

40:42.857 --> 40:46.257
You like him, then?
- Just not. Just not!

40:46.277 --> 40:48.843
Oh.
- Oh but. Oh but

40:48.863 --> 40:52.402
Liar, liar,
you're an old liar.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.868
Well,
He's a hot guy.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.823
Well finally.

40:58.623 --> 41:01.536
I'll tell you what we are doing now.
We show him the way.

41:01.834 --> 41:05.985
Before dinner, you will make yourself up.
You have to make yourself really sexy.

41:06.005 --> 41:09.155
I also have a top case.
That is it in combination with your tits

41:09.175 --> 41:12.450
simply cut only from the stool.
But really. - All right.

41:12.470 --> 41:16.579
Do you promise me that you behave,
while I'm away? - Of course.

41:16.599 --> 41:18.386
Okay, see you later.

41:22.522 --> 41:25.254
What are you already doing again?
- Nothing, why?

41:25.274 --> 41:28.642
If only once again a secret ingredient.
For those who love boys.

41:30.780 --> 41:32.345
What is it now?

41:32.365 --> 41:35.904
A little finesse,
supports their masculinity.

41:36.744 --> 41:38.701
Aha, their masculinity.

41:39.956 --> 41:43.815
For someone who has never had sex,
you have it but sly old ears.

41:43.835 --> 41:46.901
We Jenna promised,
that we no longer do such things.

41:46.921 --> 41:49.038
You might.
And if.

41:52.593 --> 41:54.300
Food is ready!

41:58.016 --> 41:59.382
Smells so yummy.

41:59.809 --> 42:03.177
Oh, no, Charlie.
The place is only reserved otherwise.

42:04.188 --> 42:06.504
Is indeed something completely new.
I did not realize,

42:06.524 --> 42:11.315
that the spaces are allocated here.
- Charlie, sit down next to me, please, okay?

42:24.292 --> 42:25.578

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Thank you.

42:32.508 --> 42:34.657
Tell me,
what does that mean?

An Asian, good food.
Muay Thai.

42:39.807 --> 42:41.956
Does not

42:41.976 --> 42:46.377
Is not it. - Who says we

42:46.397 --> 42:49.856
Oh please, but everything is back
came out, is not it?

42:51.235 --> 42:56.679
My dad always says, and is a doctor,
over Poop will not talk while eating.

42:56.699 --> 42:59.066
Guys,
We're really very sorry.

42:59.410 --> 43:03.154

and has toiled without end,

Of course they expected because that ...

43:07.126 --> 43:08.992

43:12.048 --> 43:16.365
Here, this special sauce
belongs necessarily so.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.342
What do you all have
after eating before?

43:19.555 --> 43:22.205
So we go afterwards

43:22.225 --> 43:25.708
There is a band playing and we want to check,
whether it is good for our fundraising event.

43:25.728 --> 43:28.095
Cool, we are the
Daredevil troupe.

43:33.361 --> 43:35.426
Okay, well, cool.

43:35.446 --> 43:38.054
So, we are not yet
the daredevil troupe.

43:38.074 --> 43:44.036
You do not like the term well.
Forget it. No shit, I ...

43:46.749 --> 43:51.400
Sorry, friends. That's a private party

Not at all.

46:38.379 --> 46:42.071
Do you know what we just

but rather practical.

48:24.652 --> 48:27.301
All right. - But if you do not ...
You already know...

48:27.321 --> 48:30.610
Can we perhaps it
use as a hat rack?

48:31.784 --> 48:34.850
As a shoehorn?
We can also throw horseshoes.

49:49.695 --> 49:52.062

Call me from Paris.

52:08.876 --> 52:12.335
Okay I got it.
I wish you a good flight. Bye Bye.

52:14.381 --> 52:18.751
Damn it. I guess I'm at
a turning point arrived, man.

52:19.595 --> 52:22.202
You need Joe,
Be the lifeguards.

52:22.222 --> 52:24.538
Johnny, right?
- Yes, how did you know?

52:24.558 --> 52:27.875
I am pleased. I deal
me always with the winners.

52:27.895 --> 52:29.932
I want to know,
who depends here.

52:30.981 --> 52:32.347
So what's up?

52:32.816 --> 52:36.467
I'm not sure, because I
have never thought about it.

52:36.487 --> 52:39.025
Who pulls the well
serious consideration?

52:39.740 --> 52:42.389
Believe me,
Such problems have very many.

52:42.409 --> 52:44.642
You're out of here.

52:44.662 --> 52:47.144
Is anyone ever
come to the beach

52:47.164 --> 52:51.158
and has offered you
To become a movie star and model?

52:51.752 --> 52:54.540
Was that a guy or a woman?
- That was a guy.

52:55.214 --> 52:58.113
Did he touch your penis
or a different part of the body?

52:58.133 --> 53:00.699
Oh no, in this direction it is
not gone. - If yes may be.

53:00.719 --> 53:03.302
I have to exclude it.
Well, listen.

53:03.639 --> 53:06.427
I think something comes
every now and then before.

53:07.059 --> 53:09.708
And if you believe,
that what is for you,

53:09.728 --> 53:12.015
Then Try it out for yourself.

53:12.356 --> 53:15.339
Thank you, Joe.
No thing, man. Good luck with it.

53:15.359 --> 53:17.146
Thank you.
- Keep me up to date.

53:17.695 --> 53:20.233
That should not have happened.
Not really.

53:20.781 --> 53:24.320
That was a few weeks ago
and he is a huge asshole.

53:25.327 --> 53:28.741
At least for one thing
he had to use surely.

53:32.418 --> 53:34.566
This is not now
the right time for such a thing.

53:34.586 --> 53:37.986
It just developed
everything really well with Vincent.

53:38.006 --> 53:40.572
I thought,
that could be really something,

53:40.592 --> 53:43.742
and if I say it to him,
He will hate me for all time.

53:43.762 --> 53:45.799
And if not you tell him?

53:46.056 --> 53:48.706
You make it easy
your little secret.

53:48.726 --> 53:51.959
If yes just typical.
But I pull something not.

53:51.979 --> 53:54.187
I would never do that to him.

53:54.773 --> 53:58.424
Want to have the baby?
- Can I get you now not answer.

53:58.444 --> 54:01.677
I am actually much too young.
- You do not have to justify yourself.

54:01.697 --> 54:05.347
Not really. Before anyone.
Do what you think is right.

54:05.367 --> 54:08.434
Perhaps the bond
between Vincent and you strong enough.

54:08.454 --> 54:11.061
No she is not.
I can not do this.

54:11.081 --> 54:14.199
I can not do that to him the real.
I can not but ...

54:16.712 --> 54:17.828
Shit.

54:20.591 --> 54:22.457
You have to give time to her now.

54:38.484 --> 54:39.770
Hey, Johnny!

54:41.487 --> 54:42.853
Hi, Lola!

54:44.281 --> 54:46.638
Beautiful bikini. - Thank you.

54:46.658 --> 54:49.617
I hop into the hot tub now.
Want to come in with?

54:51.288 --> 54:53.905
According to me.
- I do not want to compel yes.

54:55.209 --> 54:57.858
Sorry, I'm just
not particularly good mood.

54:57.878 --> 55:00.319
Is somehow a
pretty strange day today.

55:00.339 --> 55:01.705
What happened?

55:02.758 --> 55:06.718
Nothing at all. Have still no owner
what belongs. That's the problem.

55:07.971 --> 55:09.928
Then come on in now.

55:11.141 --> 55:12.873
Actually, you're
not my type,

55:12.893 --> 55:15.931
but I'll simply times
make an exception with you.

55:16.814 --> 55:18.430
That is nice of you.

55:18.857 --> 55:22.257
I am not only
the successful college athlete.

55:22.277 --> 55:26.271
I have more hopes
and dreams. I have a degree.

55:26.907 --> 55:29.598
What did you study?
- Sport Sciences.

55:29.618 --> 55:32.935
But one day, as I had
an experience that everything has changed.

55:32.955 --> 55:35.572
That was nice
a while ago in a theater.

55:38.252 --> 55:40.209
Since I had my doubts.

55:42.464 --> 55:45.252
What? I thought,
I'm not your type.

55:46.176 --> 55:49.044
I told you that I
when you make an exception.

55:52.683 --> 55:54.915
But you did not
something tipped into the water?

55:54.935 --> 55:58.895
I'm understandably cautious.
- Is nothing in it except me.

56:00.107 --> 56:01.223
All right.

56:07.531 --> 56:10.097
If a horse in a bar.
The bartender says:

56:10.117 --> 56:11.858
"Why the long face?"

56:13.537 --> 56:16.395
Checked?
- The Gag is 100 years old.

56:16.415 --> 56:19.231
I think I am
really at a crossroads.

56:19.251 --> 56:22.818
No matter which way I look,
everywhere just wasteland.

56:22.838 --> 56:26.172
I have until a week ago
not even seen the sea.

56:26.633 --> 56:29.366
Now I swim in it rum.
Only a few days ago

56:29.386 --> 56:32.870
a stranger comes up to me
and offers me that he helps me,

56:32.890 --> 56:34.256
my dream to live.

56:34.725 --> 56:37.040
No shit,
how often does something like that before already?

56:37.060 --> 56:39.418
Was clear that he
now no longer reports.

56:39.438 --> 56:44.381
I could see already that it on
the world is so much more than I thought times.

56:44.401 --> 56:48.802
Everyone has actually a lot more options.
I think I'll move here.

56:48.822 --> 56:52.031
Very impulsive, do not you think?
- Well, if you say so.

56:52.576 --> 56:54.863
At home keeps me
Simply nothing.

56:55.579 --> 56:57.286
I'm as good as here.

57:10.677 --> 57:12.885
I do not know,
What I should say.

57:13.597 --> 57:15.384
You must indeed say anything.

57:23.774 --> 57:25.060
What you up to?

57:58.433 --> 57:59.469
Okay.

58:09.111 --> 58:12.650
What was that? - Sorry, I thought
Anyway, that brings women in the mood.

59:51.755 --> 59:53.041
Jenna?

59:54.841 --> 59:56.207
Hey, Jenna.

59:57.803 --> 01:00:00.261
I have you
been looking for everywhere.

01:00:01.348 --> 01:00:04.762
Now you've found me yes.
Unfortunately, you did.

01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:10.013
So please,
what do you mean "unfortunately"?

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:14.091
Hey. - Have the whole day
I tried, you go out of the way.

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:15.898
Here we have to talk.

01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:23.318
This is all much too fast to me.
Well, I really want to ...

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:28.410
I can not...
I do not think this is going to work.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.328
Okay.

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:39.116
We were maybe
really fast.

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:41.535
We do now
just a little slower.

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:44.621
That's fine for me.
Honest. - No, Vincent, no.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.679
You did not understand me.
This is not a good solution. I ...

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:51.795
I think I got us
since purely ridden almost in what.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.602
I want to in any case.

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:58.301
I ... I can not tell you,
if I'm still here tomorrow.

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:00.563
I probably go
home. - What?

01:01:01.032 --> 01:01:04.057
You ...
You can now not go easy.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:06.810
If you do that,
it was really with us.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.104
And all the others
must then also home.

01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:11.106
Do you really want do you mean?

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:13.024
You can not be serious.

01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:16.412
That was until now
really nice with us two, right?

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.262
I would still do anything for you.

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:30.500
You can not just now but
disappear from my life.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.886
Farewell, Vincent.

01:01:32.564 --> 01:01:34.681
I hope,
that we are never again.

01:01:36.067 --> 01:01:38.675
When I least
would know your reasons.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:42.063
Well, then I'm going.
- No, I'll go.

01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:45.195
I want you to stay.

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:07.287
Your cute,
nocturnal visitor is back.

01:02:07.307 --> 01:02:10.015
Was clear. That's cute.

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:19.841
Let yourself his efforts
actually completely cold?

01:02:19.861 --> 01:02:23.929
What should I do? Should I bring a
blow, just because he holds a candle stupid?

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:26.181
I think it's beautiful
quite romantic.

01:02:26.201 --> 01:02:29.017
If you do find that great,
then you could it perhaps

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:34.231
on behalf of us both suck a.
But I should do it,

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:38.211
then it will last a lifetime
on this action to masturbate.

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:42.113
I would for all time
burning in his brain

01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:46.844
as the little bitch that he
his brain has blown out of the tail.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:50.163
Get ready would him.

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:54.143
Sorry, Charlie.
No, this is not.

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:00.145
Hi.

01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:06.054
I'll be right back.
Or not.

01:03:06.074 --> 01:03:08.361
Have fun.
- I have that safe.

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:15.313
Hi! - Hey!
- That's a surprise.

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:19.150
Shall we two a bit
to take a walk on the beach? - Good idea.

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:20.377
Well then go.

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:51.558
Hey, you take a chair.

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:55.697
Do you want a beer?
- Yes, I could well tolerated.

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:08.042
So what's up?

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:11.633
I can bury my future plans.

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:15.011
What are your plans?

01:04:15.769 --> 01:04:18.710
Jenna wants again
drive back home. Tomorrow.

01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:20.628
You know maybe, why?

01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:23.516
No, I have not heard anything.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:27.052
I can anhauen Lola,
which is to talk to her.

01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:28.470
What was that?

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:30.138
Jenna?

01:04:30.158 --> 01:04:32.195
You do not want to
come to me down?

01:04:34.162 --> 01:04:37.896
You know exactly
that the situation does not change,

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:40.482
just because you're in your
Schneckenhaus verkriechst.

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:42.960
So now come down,
otherwise I get high.

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:49.366
You're really very friendly and I know
appreciate the fact that you look after me.

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:52.619
Even in places that I thought,
that no one will find me there,

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:55.455
and the already
the second time this week.

01:04:55.475 --> 01:05:00.543
But just because you found me,
that does not mean that you know me.

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:03.421
Or?
You do not know me, no.

01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:07.133
And you also do not know anything
about me and my life, Maureen.

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:09.190
Okay, that's enough now.
I'll be high.

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:14.516
But I know you well enough,
to know that you like children.

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:18.576
And that you never do anything
would that could endanger a child.

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:24.251
I just want to
think in peace.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.997
The thing about Vincent
I have finished.

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:32.283
And I know,
that you will not hear the,

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:36.343
but I will here certainly
can get through a day longer.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.389
So. - I'll leave the Beach House.
I can not do this.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:44.730
So what happens.

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:49.360
And I beseech thee,
Meet any hasty decisions.

01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:51.608
Sleep over it again.

01:05:57.996 --> 01:05:59.612
Who comes here?

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.412
Can I? - Yeah, right.

01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:10.255
On the love.
- Hey, fuck you.

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:15.803
Say, only is Vincent shit plan
and now you. What happened?

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:34.220
Hey, all right?
- Can I have one more thing, brother?

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.948
Yes, if you still want one.

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:41.203
Respect.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:52.047
Krass, right?

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:56.302
Wow! - That was pretty bad.
So what I have never seen man.

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:05.477
Dude, why are you doing this?
- What?

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:08.184
What?
So much booze.

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:13.176
I hate beer.
I hate how it smells.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:16.906
I hate what it tastes like.
I hate it really totally.

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:20.350
That's why I can only drink so's.

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:23.989
If a trick I
learned in the fraternity.

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:28.626
One trick
you've learned since.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:32.737
Frankly, you do not look
as a connecting brother.

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:37.127
Yes, I am indeed none.
- I do not fit to those who say that.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:41.287
Although I all their
Shit took part.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.264
I was shot the same.

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:47.637
The only thing that I as
could pull out, is that stupid trick.

01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:52.645
And an idea,
what I am and what is not.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:55.051
Then we change that.

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:56.858
New meeting.

01:07:57.699 --> 01:08:00.098
The meeting of the Brotherhood
is hereby opened.

01:08:00.118 --> 01:08:02.767
I nominate Charlie
as our President.

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:05.495
Those in favor, raise your hand.
- Here! - Here!

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:11.077
The result is unanimous.
Charlie is the new president of the Brotherhood.

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:14.584
Response!

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:18.877
Only a beer,
then the speech.

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:36.676
I want at
the Brotherhood to thank.

01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:39.654
For recognition
my leadership potential.

01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:48.993
I would add that this is the largest
Is honor that I have ever approached.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.997
On the Brotherhood.
- In the Brotherhood!

01:08:57.050 --> 01:09:01.010
Do you think he was injured?
- No, the grass is still soft.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:05.135
So, he likes me
actually best.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.259
Well.

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:25.367
You've expressed, but nice.

01:09:26.703 --> 01:09:28.895
Oh man,
is the ass hard.

01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:31.981
You know what?
You're a pretty decent guy.

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:35.734
The Brotherhood leaves no
her brothers alone. - That's how it looks.

01:09:35.755 --> 01:09:37.291
Time for the box, Charlie.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.410
Today is a great day.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.912
Much larger is the evening.

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:48.140
Party!

01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:52.460
Subsequently, immediately after Yoga,
we go over

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:55.296
and help others at
the preparations for the party.

01:09:55.316 --> 01:09:57.882
I'll call the vet also
and wonder how it's Stanley.

01:09:57.902 --> 01:10:00.635
Honestly,
there's even more trouble, folks.

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:03.147
Jenna has with Vincent
Final done.

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:06.683
Oh, here they have yet
so well fitted together.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:09.519
Yes, we have last night
on the beach talking about it.

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:14.023
She wants to go. If she does that,
then you have all home.

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:17.610
We can not let that happen.
Thus it ruins everything. Even for itself.

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:19.445
I can not stop them.

01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:23.004
The only you can and you should
not leave you much time.

01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:30.220
I know you're doing anyway,
what you want, but we can talk?

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:33.209
Exactly, I have
made my decision,

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:36.129
and I do not,
that her mind yet what you can change.

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:38.106
For so what friends are for.

01:10:40.153 --> 01:10:45.138
Vincent and you all had such a strong bond.
He deserves to know the truth.

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:49.698
I do not know.
I really love him very much, but I can ...

01:10:50.538 --> 01:10:53.531
Well, I can not do that to him.
I do not want that.

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:56.065
That would not be fair.

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:59.318
In this week
but is totally much happened, right?

01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:01.070
So many great things.

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:04.458
And we do not want to lose
and you still do not.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.078
Maybe you commit
the biggest mistake of your life.

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:12.248
Since I have the matter
already committed.

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:16.002
And I find it hard enough,
having to live with the consequences.

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:18.309
There are usually
several solutions.

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:22.314
Sit down.
I'll make you some tea.

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:58.085
One may a decision,
which affects the rest of life,

01:11:58.105 --> 01:12:01.506
not break above the knee.
For everything that we decide, the following applies:

01:12:01.526 --> 01:12:05.092
This results in
perhaps unplanned developments.

01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:08.930
Everything you've done
and everything you will do even,

01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:11.098
based on these decisions.

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:14.769
Everything has to do with everything.
The right decision is important.

01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:16.854
It's okay,
I have understood.

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:20.525
Take your time, you need to especially
choose wisely.

01:12:20.545 --> 01:12:23.653
What do you think?
How will he react to the truth?

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:26.989
Hey, baby,
I'm pregnant, but not from you.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:31.911
Is not bad, right? Come on, we're getting married.
How is it looking? I bring not.

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:34.413
It is a bond
received with you.

01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:37.642
Did he not also a right to
to decide how it's going on?

01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:39.585
Tomorrow.

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:41.587
If I disturb,
then tells me.

01:12:41.607 --> 01:12:43.564
No, you do not disturb.

01:12:44.068 --> 01:12:47.093
Pretty underpants.
- Thank you, I also find.

01:12:47.113 --> 01:12:52.233
So, I'll be honest.
I was here all the time forward.

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:56.310
Already spying again?
- No, that was not really my plan.

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:59.438
I'm just awake, because I
had brutally piss. - Hey, hey!

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:02.066
ZVI!
- This means that again?

01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:05.124
Too much information.
Again. - And further?

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:10.741
I've heard everything,
I believe.

01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:12.535
Well, sit down.

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:14.704
Then you are now
also one of the girls.

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:17.091
We commit yourself
to silence.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:22.879
Silence is okay, but I have to
not be a girl, right? - But.

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:25.214
This is a sisterhood.
Swear.

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:27.842
Then I am a brother
and a sister?

01:13:27.862 --> 01:13:30.445
Promise easy
you's keep to yourself.

01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:32.690
Well, I promise.

01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:36.284
Okay, and now go pee.

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:47.128
Can I keep you company?

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:48.751
Sure, of course.

01:13:55.348 --> 01:13:57.715
So, what brings you over here?

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:00.642
I come up here forever,
if I can.

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:04.420
The sea has something
incredibly magical about it.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.478
If you share your feelings with him,
it can heal you.

01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:11.570
I do not know,
what to feel.

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:14.652
I'm proud of you.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:18.643
I'm just trying it,
doing the right thing.

01:14:18.663 --> 01:14:21.604
You did not have to say,
that you were in the hallway.

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:23.991
So I thought
briefly about it, but ...

01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:29.042
You remember me
of someone I once knew.

01:14:30.424 --> 01:14:31.631
To whom?

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:36.546
My friend.
- Where is he?

01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:40.261
He was a professional soldier, officer.

01:14:41.268 --> 01:14:44.335
He's not out
Afghanistan repatriated.

01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:45.687
I'm sorry.

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:50.893
He has worked for,
what he firmly believed.

01:14:52.279 --> 01:14:54.487
I agree
a little in you.

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:58.057
You're a good guy, Charlie.

01:14:58.077 --> 01:15:01.644
You did not deserve it,
Maggie treated you, not really.

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:04.623
It is strange,
because I wanted to.

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:07.876
But now it does me only suffering.

01:15:08.546 --> 01:15:14.884
Well, I think,
I was probably not the right person for them.

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:18.077
Maybe you're the right person.

01:15:18.097 --> 01:15:21.386
Just as you said,
not for them.

01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:32.855
Want to have the, what you
thought the hot tub on the first night?

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:41.326
What?
That to me almost explode the eggs?

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:11.495
Sorry.

01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:59.947
You're a great woman and you
not know how he will react.

01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:02.867
Do not you think,
you should give him a chance.

01:18:02.887 --> 01:18:04.844
The falls really hard for me.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:08.552
Also because my parents
have never married.

01:18:09.226 --> 01:18:14.187
So I was a love child. It's has
Love never existed when I was a little kid.

01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:18.799
And I have my, since
I was five, never seen again.

01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:22.278
So you can say,
I'm sensitive. - Wow.

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:25.639
I've had no idea.

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:29.027
I do not run so well with
a shield around at the stands on it's.

01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:35.983
Who creates it, between the lines
read, reads it, then:

01:18:36.003 --> 01:18:40.373
Gorgeous, intelligent dream woman
with a painful childhood.

01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:46.327
Sacrifices for their interests to
unplanned children of others raise.

01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:49.580
Hopes for the man of her dreams,
of her simply as traveling towards.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.666
And when he does that
and everything is not perfect,

01:18:52.686 --> 01:18:56.646
then she throws out everything
and get scared like a chicken during a thunderstorm.

01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:07.692
Not bad. - Thank you. - Were a cool
Candidate for "Got to Dance". - Really?

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:10.935
What would you do then?

01:19:10.955 --> 01:19:13.729
Never done Miss "I've got it
and also do not know if I want "?

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:16.787
Drag him to the altar
and myself believe it would be his?

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:21.462
Yes, quite possible.
Sounds like me.

01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:25.950
Just as I know my Jenna,
showered your child with love,

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:29.620
which she herself has not experienced.
Together with a man,

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:33.457
she loves above all else
and with whom she wants to build a family.

01:19:33.477 --> 01:19:36.669
Do you really not want you to him
at least should give a chance

01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:38.754
also to make a decision?

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.562
Exactly would you
namely also expected.

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:49.974
Thank you for you today all
look let. We are "Nylon Pink".

01:19:49.994 --> 01:19:51.485
Thank you!

01:19:52.204 --> 01:19:56.915
I want to now the organizers
Lola and Maggie ask on our stage.

01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:07.533
Hi guys.

01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:10.512
Hey!
Hi together, all right?

01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:15.040
Welcome to the
"Help the Robbe" -Benefizparty.

Of course we also thank Big Guy

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:36.395
You are great!

01:20:36.415 --> 01:20:39.606
Yes, let us also walk

01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:44.246

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:47.281
Hi, Doctor!

01:20:47.301 --> 01:20:51.035
Thanks, guys, unfortunately, could
Stanley does not provide for the Party,

01:20:51.055 --> 01:20:55.122
but he told me that here as a sign
his appreciation given.

01:20:55.142 --> 01:20:56.508
Thank you from him!

01:20:58.479 --> 01:21:02.796
All right, dear friends,
enjoying the evening and although with "Nylon Pink"!

01:21:02.816 --> 01:21:04.273
Now it's celebrating!

01:21:21.251 --> 01:21:23.484
Johnny,
where have you been, tell me?

01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:26.362
I've been looking for you everywhere.
- You should only need to call back.

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:28.822
That's what I want, yes, but my
Smartphone has fallen into the toilet.

01:21:28.842 --> 01:21:31.700
I've lost all my contacts.
I am fully screwed.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:35.088
A nightmare, man.
I'm so glad to have found you here.

01:21:35.474 --> 01:21:38.123
Charlie, that's Andy West.
Andy West, Charlie.

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:40.601
Hi, Charlie, Andy West Coast.
Glad man.

01:21:43.023 --> 01:21:45.172
Okay.
Johnny, no shit, man.

01:21:45.192 --> 01:21:48.425
I told you that you are a white
Shirt attract shalt. You know what? - Yes.

01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:52.155
I have attached a photographer for you.
He has a few pictures of you shot.

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:55.808
Great photos.
I told you clearly made an audition.

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:58.102
Cool, thanks.
But how can I reach you now?

01:21:58.122 --> 01:22:00.604
No, I will contact with you.
All right, kid?

01:22:00.624 --> 01:22:03.774
And because you me
this great job have taught,

01:22:03.794 --> 01:22:07.003
you can not refuse me,
to dance with you.

01:22:08.507 --> 01:22:09.964
Sorry, Big Guy.

01:22:11.218 --> 01:22:13.200
The Lady dances with me.

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:16.203
For each song,
all night.

01:22:16.223 --> 01:22:18.340
Is not that right, Maureen?

01:22:18.892 --> 01:22:20.849
Is that Maureen?

01:22:22.646 --> 01:22:26.630
I would really also
love dancing with you, but

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:28.882
tonight I'm with Charlie here.

01:22:28.902 --> 01:22:31.690
And when saying this,
then it will probably be so.

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:34.113
I ...

01:22:36.577 --> 01:22:39.268
...congratulations,
my little friend.

01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:40.745
Give me Five.

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:44.148
See you.
Beautiful evening.

01:22:44.168 --> 01:22:46.442
All right, Johnny.
Now Enjoy this evening.

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:49.736
I need you tomorrow afternoon.
- Tomorrow in the afternoon. I'll be there.

01:22:49.756 --> 01:22:52.614
Great. No shit.
I do not want you any longer zulabern.

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:55.534
I wish you a cool party.
- Okay, man. - See you tomorrow.

01:22:55.554 --> 01:22:58.217
I am happy man.
- Okay, man. - Keep a stiff upper lip.

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:10.767
Hey people.

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:15.613
Hey people?
We have made us all right to worry.

01:23:16.074 --> 01:23:17.598
Real, you have that?

01:23:17.618 --> 01:23:23.239
Sorry, we are running late,
we had there still to clarify some things.

01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:25.606
But cool party.

01:23:25.626 --> 01:23:29.415
This is now the right time
for a small announcement.

01:23:30.547 --> 01:23:31.913
We are engaged.

01:23:42.309 --> 01:23:44.517
I'm looking really totally for you.

01:24:10.087 --> 01:24:11.874
So, we ...

01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:16.448
... Do not have
a lot to talk about.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:19.586
We can not all our
Lifetime discuss things.

01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:22.179
Do you find genuine,
which must be now?

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:27.935
No? No.

01:24:34.111 --> 01:24:38.071
You're wasting too much time,
other people nervous with this thing.

01:24:39.533 --> 01:24:41.399
With falling since but something better.

01:24:42.244 --> 01:24:45.203
Without your stupid filming.

01:24:54.965 --> 01:24:56.422
Good or?

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.086
Okay, okay.

01:25:10.147 --> 01:25:11.354
Can I?

01:25:13.233 --> 01:25:14.599
Can I?

01:25:16.153 --> 01:25:18.361
Come on, pull it out.
- At it.

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:22.156
Do you need a ladder?

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:30.077
My lipstick looks good on you.

01:25:32.377 --> 01:25:33.834
Toll how you laugh.

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:39.448
Except that you
beautiful and pretty are,

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:43.452
you're also honest.

01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:46.455
Thank you.
- And caring and unselfish.

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:48.040
This is hard to find.

01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:49.972
You mean to me really a lot.

01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:09.036
That is fine.

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:20.043
How was it for you?

01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:22.824
That was perfect,
I would say. - Yes?

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:25.243
Yes.
- Fancy a second round?

01:26:25.263 --> 01:26:27.220
Now?
Okay, in five minutes.

01:26:27.933 --> 01:26:29.720
I come back to it. - Okay.

01:26:31.478 --> 01:26:35.212
Did not you also feel
that we are being watched?

01:26:35.232 --> 01:26:38.691
So I do about me
no thoughts. Ignore the simple.

01:26:41.822 --> 01:26:44.906
<I> Seventh day </ i>

01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:55.245
Have you seen Vincent?

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:57.859
Oh no.
Why what's going on?

01:26:57.879 --> 01:27:00.028
Nothing at all. I'm just...

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:03.365
I'm just woke up and he was gone.
I do not know where he is.

01:27:03.385 --> 01:27:06.284
There is still no one lost.
The dive again soon.

01:27:06.304 --> 01:27:08.341
How's me this morning?

01:27:09.474 --> 01:27:11.511
So what of damned cool!

01:27:12.519 --> 01:27:15.585
Does anyone what to feed?
I die of hunger.

01:27:15.605 --> 01:27:19.645

Pizza, donuts, pancakes ...
