00:13.840 --> 00:16.000
This is almost ready.

00:16.720 --> 00:17.560
Let's see.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.040
All set.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.160
Here you go.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.760
"Partay," with <i>ay? </i>Really?

00:26.320 --> 00:27.720
That's the way they say it.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.720
Quit stalling and create the event.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.000
How often is your mom out
on a Saturday night?

00:33.080 --> 00:34.520
Who are all these people?

00:34.600 --> 00:35.880
They are my friends.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.880
You still haven't told me
where you know them from.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.560
You're not the only one
making new friends.

00:41.640 --> 00:43.360
If you're too chicken to do it,

00:43.440 --> 00:44.840
-I will.
-What are you doing?

00:44.920 --> 00:45.800
Let's see.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.120
Event "partay," create...

00:48.640 --> 00:50.640
-Created. Done.
-Give me my phone!

00:50.720 --> 00:52.120
-OK.
-Idiot.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.640
We'll have strangers in our house.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.160
-You're irresponsible.
-That above all else.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.200
But I know you, Samu.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.640
You only care
about that fancy girl coming.

01:03.320 --> 01:05.320
That's why you're organizing all this.

01:07.120 --> 01:07.960
Idiot.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.880
MARINA ACCEPTED THE INVITATION

01:34.720 --> 01:35.560
Ander!

01:36.680 --> 01:37.520
Ander!

01:38.440 --> 01:39.280
Ander.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.560
Can you give me a minute
to explain myself?

01:41.640 --> 01:43.120
Or will you keep ignoring me?

01:44.440 --> 01:47.720
-I don't want you to end up--
-I know! I won't end up like your sister!

01:47.800 --> 01:51.120
She was drugged and taken advantage of.
No one's gonna do that to me!

01:51.200 --> 01:52.600
...to end up like my parents.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.280
-What do your parents have to--
-My biological parents.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.080
A week ago, I went to the agency.
I asked about them.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.480
Apparently, I was ten years too late.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.720
They both died of an overdose.

02:07.240 --> 02:10.520
That shit ruins your life, man.
I can't let anything happen to you.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.040
You're my friend.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.520
Why didn't you tell me?

02:17.160 --> 02:19.000
Because... we talk about other things.

02:19.080 --> 02:22.200
We talk about cars, girls, parties,
but not that.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.600
Maybe we should, right?

02:25.840 --> 02:26.680
Yeah.

02:27.880 --> 02:31.200
We could get kebabs and see a movie,
like the old days.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.600
I'd like that, but I'm still grounded.
Because of you.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.840
Your father listens to me.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.400
I'll talk to him.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.320
All right!

03:19.640 --> 03:22.120
You were beaten
by someone who grew up in the desert.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.920
It's as if you cared for Taliban girl.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.400
-Who's saying I care for her?
-It looks that way.

03:27.480 --> 03:29.760
I think you're gonna end up
like your sister.

03:29.880 --> 03:32.960
Falling for the first person
from the slums who crosses your path.

03:33.040 --> 03:36.000
-Fuck you, Lucrecia.
-That's what you were going to do.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.280
Fuck her, to then expose her.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.000
Because if I remember correctly,

03:41.440 --> 03:43.800
that fundamentalist threatened you
in your own home.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.560
When are you going
to cut her down to size?

03:51.040 --> 03:54.000
-I'm gonna kill you, man.
-It wasn't me, I swear.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.120
Why would I tell him anything?

03:56.400 --> 03:58.280
He's had it in for me since day one.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.720
Besides, I wouldn't tell on you.
You are my buddy.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.240
In fact,
you're the only friend I have here!

04:08.000 --> 04:10.960
-The wedding's off, then?
-Just postponed, OK?

04:11.080 --> 04:12.120
It's going to happen.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.120
It's the "weekend," man!

04:14.200 --> 04:16.840
I end up learning the important words.

04:18.120 --> 04:21.280
By the way, there's a party
at Samu's this weekend.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.560
Lots of chicks.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.240
Oh, and my buddy the dealer.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.840
I'm not telling you anything,
but there you have it.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.720
How come your parents
are letting you go to the party?

04:33.240 --> 04:35.920
-Easy, I haven't told them.
-And your brother?

04:36.160 --> 04:40.240
-No, it's better if he doesn't find out.
-Shit! What do I do with his invite?

04:41.120 --> 04:42.240
I don't know.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.920
-And your brother?
-He's the DJ.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.960
You better like twerking.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.160
-Love it.
-Oh, yeah?

04:48.240 --> 04:49.080
Look.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.680
OK, great, then.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.440
As your lawyer, I advise you
to stop talking to the police.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.440
-Unless you want to confess.
-I have nothing to confess.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.720
You were covered in the victim's blood.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.320
A victim you knew very well.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.200
With whom you were seen
having an argument.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.720
Look, Samuel,
maybe it's not what it looks like...

05:12.200 --> 05:14.360
but I doubt any judge will believe you.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.440
What if I saw someone leaving
when I got there?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.000
Who?

05:28.200 --> 05:30.320
Nano, someone is asking for you.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.320
Great burger.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.440
-You wrecked my house.
-No.

05:47.720 --> 05:48.560
Not us.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.720
We are not sent to break furniture.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.800
We break bones.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.240
Do you know how expensive wheelchairs are?

06:00.480 --> 06:03.360
-If you pay now, you'd be saving money.
-I need more time.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.160
People want what they don't have.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.320
Look.

06:10.960 --> 06:14.000
I'm working on getting the money,
but I'll need the weekend.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.360
I can say I didn't find you today.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.840
That you had left for the weekend.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.840
But on Monday...
I will have run out of excuses.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.000
And so will have you.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.160
I swear, if I had the money,
I'd lend it to you.

06:34.240 --> 06:35.120
I know.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.080
What are you going to do?

06:41.280 --> 06:43.280
Get the fucking documents.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.000
I know the combination to the safe,
so I get them...

06:47.160 --> 06:49.040
hand them over so they can get more dough

06:49.120 --> 06:52.640
from the construction company owner
than I owe... and we all win.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.560
If they catch you breaking
into that house,Â you don't win shit.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.760
-You lose it all.
-Fancy girl's going to let me in.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.160
-She's coming to the party.
-You'll try to hook up with her?

07:02.920 --> 07:04.800
-Aren't she and your brother...?
-I know.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.240
They're inseparable in class.

07:06.520 --> 07:10.080
Don't get me wrong.
If I were a chick, I'd be all over you.

07:10.160 --> 07:13.160
I'd fuck you dry.
Make you quadruplets, at least.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.440
But there's no accounting for taste.

07:16.560 --> 07:20.520
Maybe this chick isn't into good ham
and prefers bland turkey breast.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.480
No way!

07:21.760 --> 07:26.040
She's dumb enough to like me better.
For that, she deserves anything she gets.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.000
-And your brother?
-What?

07:28.080 --> 07:29.400
Does he deserve that blow?

07:29.480 --> 07:32.280
He was due for a blow regardless.
The sooner the better.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.480
Why don't we go on Monday?
Can Polo make it?

07:38.560 --> 07:40.480
You ask him. He's not talking to me.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.600
Wasn't it you who wasn't talking to him?

07:43.680 --> 07:44.520
Same thing.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.040
Same thing? Let me get this straight.

07:47.480 --> 07:50.520
He brings that caveman
into your relationship,

07:51.000 --> 07:55.160
then he freaks out, makes a scene,
and gives you the silent treatment?

07:55.840 --> 07:58.960
He's gonna expect you to get
on your knees and beg for forgiveness.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.880
And as usual, you'll do it.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.680
Why are you mad at me too?

08:03.360 --> 08:06.000
Because I can't stand it
when he walks all over you.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.560
It's good to put your ovaries on the table
every now and then!

08:20.760 --> 08:22.800
What do I say? "Marina, I like you, girl."

08:22.880 --> 08:24.080
"Gurl" with a <i>u.</i>

08:24.160 --> 08:26.440
Recite a sonnet or whatever.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.880
No, don't do that.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.520
Just make it clear that you like her.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.600
-OK.
-This can be your night.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.200
Is this a bad time to admit
I fear rejection?

08:39.800 --> 08:40.640
How do I look?

08:41.200 --> 08:44.040
You're shaking like a flan.
A very elegant flan, mind you.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.360
OK, I'll go change.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.480
Have a couple more pills?

09:01.080 --> 09:03.080
What's that?
Have you expanded the business?

09:03.720 --> 09:05.840
No surprise he has so many friends.

09:06.080 --> 09:09.320
With yours, we still needed more.
I had to go through my contacts.

09:09.960 --> 09:10.920
What are you doing?

09:11.160 --> 09:12.720
Nothing. The usual, man.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.200
-Relax, what's a couple of pills?
-Don't let Samu see.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.880
-Is this sangria?
-No.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.320
It's an alcohol-free punch.
But he put way too much sugar in it.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.400
Better stick to beer.

09:26.840 --> 09:27.680
OK.

09:27.800 --> 09:28.880
Let's have a look.

09:30.280 --> 09:31.120
Three...

09:31.400 --> 09:32.240
two...

09:32.920 --> 09:33.960
one!

09:37.920 --> 09:38.920
Not bad, right?

09:39.720 --> 09:40.600
Merry Christmas.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.400
What's up?

10:25.560 --> 10:27.120
-How are you?
-Good.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.040
Hey, do they know who I am?

10:30.200 --> 10:32.280
-They know who your dad is.
-I'm not like him.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.000
You have his last name, right?

10:34.080 --> 10:36.720
That must surely open
lots of doors for you in life.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.680
If the price is getting the stink eye
from those two, that's still a good deal.

10:41.080 --> 10:44.800
Wow, a reggaeton DJ and a philosopher!

10:46.720 --> 10:47.760
Have fun.

10:47.880 --> 10:48.720
Thanks.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.920
<i>Hey, GuzmÃ¡n, what's up?</i>

10:59.120 --> 11:01.440
Thank you for talking to my dad.

11:01.680 --> 11:04.000
In the end, he's lifted the punishment.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.240
I'm not coming today.

11:06.440 --> 11:09.720
I'm tired from training,
so I'll talk to you tomorrow, OK?

11:09.880 --> 11:10.720
<i>Bye.</i>

11:11.080 --> 11:12.240
Come on, Ander!

11:27.840 --> 11:31.560
What are you doing here?
My father is in the back room.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.640
Hello, by the way.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.680
I'm a customer, Nadia. I'm here to buy...

11:37.560 --> 11:38.400
this.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.560
Asparagus?
You've come here to buy asparagus?

11:45.040 --> 11:45.880
No.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.960
I've actually come to ask you
where the skinny kid lives.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.760
I know he's throwing a party.

11:52.920 --> 11:53.800
Well...

11:54.120 --> 11:57.560
If you don't have the address,
I guess you're not invited.

12:01.000 --> 12:01.840
Listen, Nadia.

12:02.920 --> 12:05.240
Marina is there
without my parents' permission.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.480
You don't know her
or what she's capable of.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.520
I just want to make sure she's all right.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.320
Please, tell me where she is.

12:23.920 --> 12:24.760
Nadia!

12:25.720 --> 12:27.400
Nadia, please, tell me where it is!

12:27.480 --> 12:30.560
Calm down, or I'm not going to tell you.

12:32.800 --> 12:36.520
I close in half an hour.
There's a bar across the street.

12:37.040 --> 12:40.000
Have a cup of tea whileÂ you wait,
and if you've calmed down,

12:40.520 --> 12:41.600
maybe I'll go with you.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.320
You're coming with me?

12:45.640 --> 12:46.480
No.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.200
You're coming with me.

12:48.280 --> 12:49.640
I did get an invitation.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.120
With me, they might even let you in.

12:55.640 --> 12:56.480
Sir.

12:59.760 --> 13:00.880
Your asparagus.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.280
Put it on my tab.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.920
What are you doing here?

13:34.960 --> 13:37.000
Christian invited me.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.400
I see he didn't tell you.

13:43.720 --> 13:46.400
Never mind, don't worry.
I'll introduce you to everybody.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.480
Come.

13:50.800 --> 13:51.640
Omar.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.760
This is my friend, Omar. Ander.

13:55.640 --> 13:58.840
He's in my class, but fortunately,
he's not a leader of tomorrow.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.040
-Can I take your jacket?
-Nice to meet you.

14:02.280 --> 14:04.520
Likewise. You look familiar.

14:05.160 --> 14:07.160
You don't. AndrÃ©s, was it?

14:07.440 --> 14:10.160
-Ander.
-You're RomÃ¡n, right?

14:11.800 --> 14:12.640
Thank you.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.720
AndrÃ©s, really?

14:23.440 --> 14:24.800
Samuel doesn't know about me.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.920
Which part? That you're a dealer
or that you're a fag?

14:29.280 --> 14:31.760
Neither. Does everybody know about you?

14:35.320 --> 14:37.720
Which part? That I'm a stoner
or that I'm a fag?

14:40.920 --> 14:43.960
That's why you won't answer my messages?
In case they catch you.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.200
What is it?
Can't live without me, or what?

14:49.520 --> 14:51.280
You know it! I'm here to buy.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.440
It's your lucky day.

14:55.480 --> 14:56.320
Come.

15:16.520 --> 15:17.680
I've never tried these.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.120
It's easy.
Put it in your mouth and swallow it.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.400
If you're horny now, just wait
until that hits you. See you later...

15:55.480 --> 15:56.560
AndrÃ©s.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.160
Thank you.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.680
Hey!

16:06.760 --> 16:08.400
Who wants to play spin the bottle?

16:08.480 --> 16:11.080
We're a little too old for that!
We are not children!

16:11.200 --> 16:14.120
Know who's not afraid of being childish?
An adult. Who's in?

16:14.520 --> 16:17.000
-I am.
-When he's right, he's right.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.560
Kiss, dare, or truth?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.080
Come on!

16:26.880 --> 16:28.760
Do you like anybody here at the party?

17:08.440 --> 17:09.360
It wasn't Nano.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.960
I swear to God.

17:13.560 --> 17:14.800
Why are you so sure?

17:18.320 --> 17:19.760
Who did it, Christian?

17:23.080 --> 17:24.640
Christian, who did it?

17:26.560 --> 17:28.120
I only know Nano didn't do it.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.040
I'm at the marchioness' house,

17:37.120 --> 17:40.240
chilling on the sofa,
taking off our clothes...

17:40.680 --> 17:44.000
and the guy shows up at the pool.
All that was missing was the popcorn.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.280
I swear. But that's not all.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.440
It turns outÂ he had also been watching
at Marina's party.

17:49.520 --> 17:52.080
He had a front row seat, for free.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.320
-Polo is a voyeur?
-A fucking faggot is what he is!

17:55.440 --> 17:57.960
-He got a hard-on and all.
-Like a pole.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.120
Come on, it's not such a big deal.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.200
-What's not a big deal?
-I mean...

18:05.280 --> 18:08.680
If they wanted to do that,
they should have told you, but...

18:08.760 --> 18:11.000
The fact that Polo likes guys,
if he does...

18:11.080 --> 18:12.000
Who cares?

18:12.080 --> 18:14.000
My cousin in AlmerÃ­a is a drag queen.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.480
-Yes, Eligenio.
-Eligenio, total fag, man.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.520
And he fucking rules.
I'll introduce you one day.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.000
He's with me.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.040
He just wants to talk to his sister.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.120
Come on.

18:34.520 --> 18:37.560
Let's show him that we do know
how to be good hosts.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.200
Have you seen yourself?

19:02.400 --> 19:05.160
Remember what happened
the last time we left you alone?

19:05.600 --> 19:07.000
What did you take this time?

19:07.160 --> 19:09.640
Pablo didn't drug me.
We smoked a little, that's all.

19:09.760 --> 19:13.040
I slept with him because I wanted to.
I had bad luck.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.040
Not bad luck.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.440
You slept with the wrong person,
but you don't learn

19:16.520 --> 19:18.360
and keep hanging out with those people.

19:18.600 --> 19:21.920
You still believe
it's a disease of the poor, right?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.200
Pablo liked rich girls, just like you.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.120
How do you think he got infected?

19:29.080 --> 19:30.680
It can happen to anybody.

19:31.440 --> 19:32.840
It can happen to you too.

19:33.200 --> 19:37.160
HIV doesn't give a fuck
about how big your house is,

19:37.600 --> 19:40.880
how much money you make,
or how long your list of last names is.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.440
It's not like you.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.480
Did you bring him here?

19:57.240 --> 20:00.040
-Your brother just worries about you.
-He doesn't need to.

20:01.640 --> 20:02.480
You sure?

20:03.120 --> 20:06.040
So, you're free to wear a veil,
but I can't take my clothes off?

20:06.120 --> 20:07.040
How does that work?

20:08.280 --> 20:09.560
I also have a sister.

20:10.840 --> 20:13.400
I wish somebody had worried that much
about her.

20:14.600 --> 20:19.120
-She wouldn't have ended up like she did.
-How did she end up?

20:20.360 --> 20:23.040
-Lost.
-What are you doing here?

20:25.280 --> 20:28.840
Nothing. She's come to save my soul.
But it's a bit late for that.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.600
Do you have anything without alcohol?

20:35.680 --> 20:38.360
There's punch over there,
but they put too much sugar in it.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.920
Hey, fuckers, be quiet!

20:54.080 --> 20:57.120
My brother and I have some poetry
for you. Is that OK?

20:57.200 --> 20:58.800
If not,Â too bad, it's our house. Hit it!

20:59.720 --> 21:00.560
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

21:01.520 --> 21:02.480
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

21:02.560 --> 21:04.360
<i>Say, say, say, say</i>

21:04.560 --> 21:08.040
<i>Passions, brothers, and blood</i>
<i>I have plenty balls to bust this jail</i>

21:08.120 --> 21:09.560
<i>If money doesn't count</i>
<i>If my accounts are erratic</i>

21:09.840 --> 21:11.760
<i>The reason for my hopes</i>
<i>Is not to stop making mistakes</i>

21:11.840 --> 21:13.440
<i>My life is an extreme</i>
<i>And you say no</i>

21:13.520 --> 21:16.080
<i>How to ash my cigarette</i>
<i>Or throw away a banana peel</i>

21:16.160 --> 21:18.160
<i>I don't want any money</i>
<i>I prefer a heart</i>

21:18.280 --> 21:20.240
<i>The bills asphyxiating you</i>
<i>Are not my prison</i>

21:20.320 --> 21:23.560
<i>I'm everything you're waiting for</i>
<i>I'm the one coming for you at night</i>

21:23.640 --> 21:24.520
<i>To make you dream</i>

21:24.600 --> 21:27.040
<i>I'm the starless sky</i>
<i>That can light you up, ah!</i>

21:27.120 --> 21:28.000
<i>Brother, listen</i>

21:28.080 --> 21:29.880
<i>You'll draw your dreams</i>
<i>On paper buildings</i>

21:29.960 --> 21:31.040
<i>To make them understand</i>

21:31.120 --> 21:33.560
<i>There's no triumph in the future</i>
<i>Without fighting in the present</i>

21:37.800 --> 21:38.640
Are you OK?

21:40.760 --> 21:42.760
-Yes, and you?
-I'm great.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.760
Best party of my life.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.840
Why don't you introduce me
to your friends?

21:47.920 --> 21:49.520
Those are not my friends.

21:50.160 --> 21:52.600
They are not my friends--
I'm not good with people.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.120
Or at life in general.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.680
Then why throw this party?

22:01.080 --> 22:02.760
Sorry!

22:03.360 --> 22:05.120
-Are you OK?
-Sorry. I'm really sorry.

22:05.640 --> 22:08.160
-It's OK, don't worry.
-I'm really sorry.

22:09.680 --> 22:11.000
-No problem, Samuel.
-Shit.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.480
Are you having a good time?

22:21.800 --> 22:23.600
A better time than you, for sure.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.360
You've had a sour face all night.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.880
You've been watching me, huh?

22:29.440 --> 22:30.280
Look...

22:35.080 --> 22:39.320
I also like to play, but with my luck,
I'm sure I would never get a turn.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.200
I'd rather do it without the bottle.
Want to?

22:44.760 --> 22:45.600
Truth.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.640
Why have you been looking at me all night?

22:59.440 --> 23:02.160
Why do you think
I've been looking at you all night?

23:06.160 --> 23:07.000
Kiss.

23:31.880 --> 23:32.760
Dare.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.400
Let's get out of here.

23:36.880 --> 23:37.720
And go where?

23:40.000 --> 23:41.520
Is there anybody at your place?

24:37.160 --> 24:38.480
Give me another pill.

24:38.760 --> 24:39.600
Another?

24:47.560 --> 24:49.200
Not like this, like before.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.280
Are you crazy?

24:51.440 --> 24:52.560
What are you doing?

24:53.080 --> 24:53.920
Ander!

24:55.360 --> 24:56.840
-Why are you here?
-GuzmÃ¡n.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.880
You lied to me
and used me to get away...

24:59.120 --> 25:02.200
but the worst part is you did it
to come to this party. Why?

25:02.280 --> 25:03.160
Look who it is!

25:03.240 --> 25:05.560
-It's the Ken doll!
-I'm talking to my friend.

25:05.720 --> 25:08.200
He's my friend, too.
Actually, I invited him.

25:08.280 --> 25:11.040
-You're crashing.
-Yeah, I was dying to come.

25:11.120 --> 25:13.720
Let's see.
I think the chlorine from the pool

25:13.800 --> 25:15.720
must have atrophied
that part of the brain

25:15.800 --> 25:17.160
that takes hints.

25:17.520 --> 25:18.760
We don't want you here.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.200
Shall I say it in English
so you understand?

25:23.080 --> 25:24.520
-GuzmÃ¡n...
-What are you doing?

25:25.000 --> 25:26.400
-What are you on?
-Nothing.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.120
-You are high!
-I'm not!

25:28.200 --> 25:29.080
You can't shut up!

25:29.160 --> 25:30.440
-I didn't take anything!
-You!

25:30.520 --> 25:32.040
-What did you give him?
-Nothing.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.960
Don't go near him again,
not even with a cough drop.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.760
Or your sister, mother, father,

25:36.840 --> 25:38.800
and your whole family
will know what you do, OK?

25:38.960 --> 25:41.160
GuzmÃ¡n, I'm fine.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.600
Stop lying to me, you retard. He told me!

25:44.280 --> 25:45.120
OK?

25:45.600 --> 25:48.360
If it's about joints, pills,
or cheap hair gel, I trust him.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.560
Don't yell at him. He's so dumb,
he told me unintentionally.

25:52.640 --> 25:53.640
Fuck off, GuzmÃ¡n!

25:53.920 --> 25:56.000
Fuck you, too! And fuck you!

25:56.760 --> 25:58.240
You hear me? Fuck all of you!

26:01.240 --> 26:03.960
Maybe I'll wind up having a good time
after all.

26:29.640 --> 26:31.640
-Nadia, did you drink?
-Only punch.

26:33.480 --> 26:35.960
That punch is loaded with sugar.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.520
Samu! The cops!

26:39.440 --> 26:40.280
The cops!

26:51.080 --> 26:54.640
Polo, have you told your mothers
you are coming with us to Sardinia

26:55.000 --> 26:56.040
for Easter?

26:56.880 --> 26:58.440
I may have other plans.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.880
I need to think. I don't know if I'll go.

27:02.440 --> 27:04.240
Whatever GuzmÃ¡n says, surely.

27:05.720 --> 27:06.560
Excuse me?

27:08.120 --> 27:09.480
Wow, you're talking to me.

27:10.320 --> 27:13.040
-Carla, this is not the mom--
-Come now, kid.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.800
After the fortune your mothers
have spentÂ on speech therapists!

27:25.600 --> 27:27.560
Please, don't tag the wall, OK?

27:30.240 --> 27:32.440
Or what? They'll take away your hot tub?

27:33.200 --> 27:36.920
You think I'm the typical rich girl
who's had nothing bad happen to her?

27:37.320 --> 27:38.240
Actually, yes.

27:48.760 --> 27:51.960
-There's something you should know.
-Oh, really?

27:53.480 --> 27:54.320
OK, then.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.040
Truth.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.240
What should I know?

29:00.680 --> 29:01.520
Where to now?

29:05.080 --> 29:08.200
-I'm going home, and so are you.
-Why?

29:09.760 --> 29:12.200
Because you all are bad
at looking down on people.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.080
At least we do it discreetly.

29:20.560 --> 29:21.920
I want to swim in your pool.

29:25.760 --> 29:27.840
The two of us, swimming in my pool?

29:29.520 --> 29:30.360
No.

29:33.360 --> 29:37.040
Shall I tell the principal...
what I saw in the showers?

29:44.440 --> 29:46.280
So swimming in my pool, huh?

29:48.920 --> 29:49.800
Fantastic idea.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.880
-Let's go?
-Let's go.

30:03.320 --> 30:04.560
You're not going to talk?

30:05.960 --> 30:09.040
OK, it's enough if you listen.
I really don't understand.

30:09.120 --> 30:12.280
Why did you have to ruin it all
if we both liked it?

30:12.560 --> 30:13.560
I panicked, OK?

30:15.760 --> 30:17.680
What if you like him better than me?

30:18.680 --> 30:21.120
Remember what you told me after the party?

30:24.680 --> 30:26.040
"I love you more than ever."

30:26.560 --> 30:28.160
I felt the same way.

30:28.520 --> 30:31.160
I loved you more than ever
because you did what you wanted,

30:31.240 --> 30:33.200
regardless of what people think.

30:35.640 --> 30:36.480
Carla!

30:38.440 --> 30:39.520
Fuck the world.

30:40.440 --> 30:42.880
-What else do you want to do?
-You want to know?

31:39.720 --> 31:40.640
Come on in.

31:44.960 --> 31:49.200
-Shit. Please, they can't see you here.
-That wouldn't be good for me either.

31:53.360 --> 31:54.920
Wait here for a moment, OK?

31:59.320 --> 32:00.160
Hello.

32:00.840 --> 32:01.680
Hello.

32:02.640 --> 32:03.720
What are you doing?

32:04.080 --> 32:05.600
Nothing. You?

32:06.960 --> 32:11.400
-You could have answered my calls.
-And you could leave me alone, right?

32:21.120 --> 32:22.480
Omar.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.760
-Have another pill?
-Stop it.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.520
Guys. You deal?

32:30.240 --> 32:31.280
Get lost.

32:32.560 --> 32:33.800
-No.
-What are you doing? Let's go.

32:33.880 --> 32:34.840
Stop.

32:37.280 --> 32:39.760
I mean, do you sell pills or anything?

32:41.680 --> 32:44.560
-Do we look like dealers?
-Ander, come, let's go.

32:45.240 --> 32:47.120
You don't look like boy scouts.

32:47.640 --> 32:49.080
-Man.
-Is he for real?

32:49.480 --> 32:50.320
Ander!

32:54.120 --> 32:56.760
Who do you think you are, rich boy? Look.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.520
Hey, leave him alone.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.120
Easy, man. Easy.

33:09.520 --> 33:10.400
Please, stop.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.560
Leave him alone.
Can't you see he's high?

33:12.880 --> 33:13.720
Please.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.040
Stop, please.

33:16.400 --> 33:17.240
Let's go.

33:17.400 --> 33:20.920
-Get out of here!
-Take your boyfriend, you fucking Muslim!

33:27.120 --> 33:31.480
See? If you'd given me a fucking pill,
this wouldn't have happened.

33:35.560 --> 33:37.000
Go fuck yourself, man.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.280
And don't call me again.

33:39.920 --> 33:40.760
Or write.

33:41.600 --> 33:42.440
Why?

33:44.840 --> 33:48.360
Why?<i></i>Are you so high you don't remember?

33:49.120 --> 33:50.840
Your friend threatened me.

33:51.320 --> 33:54.080
-And if they find out about me...
-Which part?

33:56.360 --> 33:58.480
If that gets out, you'll ruin my life.

34:00.320 --> 34:04.440
It's best if...
we don't see each other again.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.440
Best for both of us.

34:19.040 --> 34:19.880
Nadia?

34:55.120 --> 34:56.240
Are you getting in?

35:21.120 --> 35:21.960
Are you OK?

35:23.000 --> 35:24.440
I've never felt better.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.680
You've been drugged, Nadia.

35:38.480 --> 35:39.360
You're high.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.560
Where are you going?

35:55.560 --> 35:57.680
To get a towel and call a cab.

36:22.720 --> 36:23.880
What happened?

36:26.320 --> 36:27.880
What do you mean, what happened?

36:28.480 --> 36:30.400
He hurt himself in your pool.

36:32.760 --> 36:33.600
Ander?

36:34.280 --> 36:35.760
Yes, Antonio, sorry.

36:36.120 --> 36:37.760
I'm surprised.
I didn't know it was that bad.

36:37.840 --> 36:39.040
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

36:39.920 --> 36:43.200
Yes, he'll have to wear it for two weeks.
You should be more careful.

36:44.080 --> 36:46.600
It was my fault. I wasn't looking,
and he started goofing off.

36:47.920 --> 36:48.920
It won't happen again.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.080
I'll keep an eye on him.

36:55.440 --> 36:56.520
All right, then.

37:10.800 --> 37:11.640
What?

37:14.920 --> 37:16.080
It means "I'm sorry."

37:17.400 --> 37:20.800
I should have stayed out of your life.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.120
How do you say "I'm still hungover"?

37:29.480 --> 37:32.680
You remind me of May. My sister.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.800
She used to smile all the time too.

37:37.880 --> 37:42.240
Even if she felt sad on the inside.
Mainly, when she felt sad on the inside.

37:44.480 --> 37:48.280
What did you mean the other day
when you said she was lost?

37:49.200 --> 37:50.120
She drank.

37:50.640 --> 37:51.480
She smoked.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.560
Went out with boys.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.640
She wanted to be like all Spanish girls.

37:55.720 --> 37:57.640
She ended up doing what none of them do.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.480
She left home at 18.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.520
It's been two years...

38:13.760 --> 38:15.120
without any news from her.

38:15.840 --> 38:16.680
All I know...

38:17.800 --> 38:19.920
is she left my family brokenhearted.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.720
And the last thing I want
is to do the same.

38:25.520 --> 38:28.280
-I think I'm also losing myself a little.
-Nadia.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.440
We are 16 years old.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.800
If we don't lose ourselves now, then when?

38:38.560 --> 38:41.120
We have all our lives
to find ourselves again.

38:52.560 --> 38:53.640
We have a witness

38:53.720 --> 38:56.360
who saw you run bloodstained
out of the school.

38:56.440 --> 38:57.440
A witness?

38:58.080 --> 39:00.320
Of course. Some rich kid, probably.

39:01.520 --> 39:04.560
Of course, because they never lie, right?

39:04.960 --> 39:06.560
Our witness is Samuel.

39:07.120 --> 39:07.960
Your brother.

39:10.680 --> 39:11.560
Is he lying?

39:13.200 --> 39:17.240
He knows perfectly well
I would never hurt Marina.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.720
-Why?
-Because we were together.

39:31.680 --> 39:32.520
Thank you.

39:32.800 --> 39:33.640
What for?

39:35.720 --> 39:38.640
For... not taking advantage
of the situation.

39:41.040 --> 39:41.880
And for the cab.

39:42.560 --> 39:44.960
-I'll pay you back.
-No problem. My treat.

39:47.880 --> 39:49.520
Who would have thought.

39:50.320 --> 39:51.760
You are a gentleman.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.160
You surprised me too.

39:58.880 --> 40:01.440
I did not see that business
with the pool coming.

40:02.120 --> 40:03.800
Gentlemen don't mention those things.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.520
Never. Ever. OK?

40:06.680 --> 40:07.520
OK.

40:25.600 --> 40:28.200
Can I give you some advice? As a friend.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.840
-Are we friends?
-No.

40:31.760 --> 40:35.360
But we are women.
And I don't like it when men toy with us.

40:36.720 --> 40:41.000
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-GuzmÃ¡n's only interested in you

40:41.080 --> 40:43.440
because he bet
he could take your virginity.

40:43.520 --> 40:46.040
To then humiliate you and tell everybody.

40:46.640 --> 40:50.000
To get back at you for threatening him
the night of the party.

40:50.920 --> 40:51.960
He's so vindictive.

40:54.800 --> 40:55.640
That is a lie.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.360
Ask him.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.280
-Ready, girls?
-Friends?

41:00.840 --> 41:02.480
Positions, and...

41:12.600 --> 41:13.440
Nadia.

41:14.880 --> 41:16.200
I swear it was her idea.

41:16.560 --> 41:18.320
And you think that's an excuse?

41:19.160 --> 41:21.960
I'd expect it from her.
But I don't know what to think of you.

41:22.040 --> 41:25.400
I had you in my pool, ready for anything,
and I didn't touch you.

41:25.480 --> 41:29.400
Not for lack of wanting to. It's true.
I could have taken advantage, but...

41:30.040 --> 41:31.920
I could've taken advantage,
but I didn't.

41:32.600 --> 41:35.160
So... I should thank you.

41:36.280 --> 41:38.480
For not going through
with your plan to humiliate me.

41:39.960 --> 41:43.440
Do you realize how disgusting it is
to even consider that?

41:44.280 --> 41:46.400
The kind of person that makes you?

41:48.400 --> 41:49.680
You're no saint either.

41:51.720 --> 41:52.560
Excuse me?

41:52.840 --> 41:55.560
You spread your legs for me in my pool,
Nadia.

42:05.240 --> 42:06.560
I had been drugged.

42:07.240 --> 42:08.080
Marina.

42:18.280 --> 42:21.280
I'd offer to pay your dry cleaning,
but I'd be lying. I'm broke.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.520
-It doesn't matter.
-Yes, it does.

42:23.760 --> 42:26.840
You're avoiding me, and I understand.
I screwed up the other day.

42:27.800 --> 42:29.360
-You didn't.
-I did.

42:29.720 --> 42:32.800
I had too much wine, vodka...
too much alcohol.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.240
I wanted to feel brave,

42:34.320 --> 42:35.920
-but I just threw up.
-Don't--

42:36.000 --> 42:38.360
I needed some Dutch courage
to tell you I like you.

42:41.040 --> 42:43.760
Samuel, I'm not good for you.
There's things about me--

42:43.840 --> 42:44.680
What things?

42:46.960 --> 42:47.800
What things?

43:01.360 --> 43:03.000
I am HIV-positive.

43:17.440 --> 43:18.440
I don't know what to say.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.000
It doesn't matter.

43:23.720 --> 43:26.640
I'm OK with you not saying anything...
to anybody.

43:39.320 --> 43:40.920
You can stay at my place.

43:41.680 --> 43:45.720
So when they show up at mine,
they'll find my mom and Samu, right?

43:47.040 --> 43:49.320
-Life sucks, Nano.
-Fucking right.

43:53.280 --> 43:56.080
Look at her. She's saying
she wants to meet so we can talk.

43:57.040 --> 43:57.920
I'll pass.

43:58.360 --> 44:01.240
If they want to spice things up,
they should find somebody else.

44:04.080 --> 44:06.760
Do you know why they need
to spice up their relationship?

44:06.840 --> 44:08.920
Because it's bland, Christian.

44:09.040 --> 44:11.480
That's why they're looking
for a good stud.Â Listen...

44:11.920 --> 44:13.600
The more she can compare...

44:13.680 --> 44:16.160
the more she'll see
that what she has looks expensive,

44:16.240 --> 44:19.200
but it's just a cheap plastic trinket.

44:20.640 --> 44:23.560
-So what are you trying to say?
-Don't be stupid.

44:24.080 --> 44:27.760
That guy's letting you steal
his girlfriend right under his nose.

44:27.840 --> 44:29.240
You can't pass on that.

44:30.520 --> 44:31.360
I won't.

44:32.640 --> 44:33.600
Attaboy.

44:35.920 --> 44:37.920
You can't be doing this to me, Carla!

44:38.000 --> 44:40.280
What do you mean,
you have something else to do?

44:40.840 --> 44:42.400
Do you think I'm stupid?

44:42.640 --> 44:45.800
Why don't you just say you have a date
with that fucking influencer?

44:46.840 --> 44:47.840
You know what?

44:48.680 --> 44:52.160
I pity you for letting people
boss you around like this.

44:52.240 --> 44:55.240
And for having such low self-esteem...
dear.

44:55.320 --> 44:57.680
Stop treating me like I'm being abused,
OK?

44:57.760 --> 45:00.320
You say you're progressive
and that you do what you want with men,

45:00.400 --> 45:03.520
but the only reason you agreed
to be GuzmÃ¡n's fuck buddy

45:03.600 --> 45:07.760
is that he didn't want anything serious,
and you wanted him really bad.

45:11.480 --> 45:13.000
Oh, sorry.

45:13.640 --> 45:16.080
I was just putting my ovaries
on the table.

45:22.440 --> 45:23.280
Hello.

45:24.600 --> 45:26.200
Son of a bitch!

45:26.720 --> 45:29.040
Check out this shack!

45:29.960 --> 45:31.320
It's beautiful!

45:32.040 --> 45:33.160
Is this yours?

45:33.520 --> 45:37.320
Our parents bought it for us,
and we are furnishing it little by little.

45:37.840 --> 45:39.440
We got the bed last Friday.

45:40.240 --> 45:41.520
Great.

45:54.800 --> 45:56.280
Christian, do you like fish?

45:56.560 --> 45:58.160
Is that a trick question?

45:58.680 --> 46:00.760
We're about to order dinner. Our treat.

46:02.120 --> 46:04.680
-Besides, I think we owe you that.
-OK.

46:19.400 --> 46:20.240
Listen...

46:21.000 --> 46:23.120
The neighbor who called the cops told mom.

46:23.240 --> 46:25.600
So we are in trouble. What's the matter?

46:27.200 --> 46:28.040
Marina.

46:29.480 --> 46:30.680
What's wrong with Marina?

46:32.880 --> 46:34.600
She's HIV-positive, Nano.

46:40.160 --> 46:43.920
That's not the worst part.
I stood there and didn't know what to say.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.800
Instead of telling her I don't care.

46:46.080 --> 46:47.480
Besides, it's not a problem.

46:47.560 --> 46:50.840
I've been reading up online,
and nowadays, it's no big deal.

46:50.920 --> 46:53.320
Instead, I just stood there
and stared like an idiot.

46:59.320 --> 47:01.320
We have it all planned. All of it.

47:01.440 --> 47:03.160
Even our retirement.

47:03.440 --> 47:05.840
-Sometimes, it's too much, right?
-Yeah.

47:06.080 --> 47:08.280
That's why we decided to add some...

47:09.360 --> 47:13.160
-spice to our lives.
-And that would be me, right?

47:13.240 --> 47:14.200
The spice.

47:14.440 --> 47:17.240
Which one am I?
Pepper, cayenne, hot chili?

47:17.400 --> 47:18.800
Forgive us, really.

47:19.960 --> 47:22.880
But... it wasn't so horrible, right?
At least, I hope so.

47:23.920 --> 47:25.360
Didn't you have a good time?

47:27.320 --> 47:28.160
I did.

47:28.600 --> 47:30.000
Would you like to do it again?

47:48.200 --> 47:50.080
Have you ever had a threesome?

49:02.560 --> 49:04.200
I love you more than ever.

49:04.440 --> 49:05.920
I love you more than ever.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.120
He told you, right?

49:33.560 --> 49:35.400
I'm on medication. It's undetectable.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.160
That means I can't infect you.

49:43.520 --> 49:45.280
I don't care that you didn't tell me.

49:46.560 --> 49:49.360
But you kept quiet
because you were afraid I'd bolt.

49:49.440 --> 49:51.080
It's not a problem, it's normal.

49:52.480 --> 49:55.560
But that's why you told Samu,
to scare him away.

49:58.080 --> 49:59.880
-Maybe.
-Marina, please.

50:00.880 --> 50:02.760
You don't know him. You won't be able to.

50:03.080 --> 50:06.160
He'll research it, and tomorrow,
he'll know more about it than you.

50:07.680 --> 50:08.840
Why are you here?

50:09.360 --> 50:10.320
Shit.

50:12.720 --> 50:15.680
Stop toying with my brother,
and tell him the fucking truth.

50:15.760 --> 50:16.960
That you're not into him.

50:17.520 --> 50:19.120
I'm not toying with him.

50:19.640 --> 50:21.280
-I feel something, but...
-Yeah.

50:22.120 --> 50:23.560
Like with me the other night?

50:24.360 --> 50:26.040
No way. That is easy to see.

50:30.880 --> 50:32.760
You felt something, too.

50:34.000 --> 50:34.840
Didn't you?

50:36.000 --> 50:36.840
Come on.

50:38.640 --> 50:39.480
Truth.

50:41.080 --> 50:42.480
This isn't a fucking game!

50:49.200 --> 50:50.960
<i>Did you know she was pregnant?</i>

50:52.920 --> 50:53.880
Did I know?

50:55.720 --> 50:57.600
Whose baby do you think that was?

51:00.720 --> 51:03.320
Why do you think
we were going to run away together?

51:04.520 --> 51:06.200
I went to school to pick her up...

51:07.800 --> 51:09.320
I found her like that.

51:10.360 --> 51:12.480
We wanted to get as far
as we could from here.

51:14.880 --> 51:16.840
Do you know who couldn't stand the idea?

51:18.560 --> 51:20.120
Your fucking witness.

51:21.400 --> 51:22.240
Are you...

51:22.400 --> 51:23.640
suggesting...

51:24.600 --> 51:26.320
that your brother killed her?

52:43.040 --> 52:45.800
