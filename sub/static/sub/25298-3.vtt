one head-on.

08:30.090 --> 08:32.472
Courage isn't
not having fear,

All right, girl,
I know things are tough,

19:31.881 --> 19:34.173
but tough is just a word
in a big book of other words,

19:34.173 --> 19:36.215

19:36.215 --> 19:39.388
The only thing that matters
is that you go out there

19:39.388 --> 19:42.301
and show 'em what kind of dog
you really are.

19:42.301 --> 19:44.393
Just remember,
there's no "I" in goat,

19:44.393 --> 19:49.939

and that almost spells "dog."
