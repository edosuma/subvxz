01:30.841 --> 01:33.302
There are two things you should
know about the Van Stomms.

01:33.302 --> 01:35.929
One, we always set
our alarms on time,

01:35.929 --> 01:39.600
and two, if we don't, we show
up early and take our lumps.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.852
We've even got
a song about it.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.854

all of my enemies into orbit

so far into the atmosphere,

05:05.180 --> 05:07.307

melt into nothingness.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.591

I forgot about random
green rays from the sky!

08:51.531 --> 08:52.574
Oh, no!

08:53.324 --> 08:54.325
Not on my watch.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.712
Oh, man! I've run out of
conveniently placed objects.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.088
Bingg!

09:08.214 --> 09:10.341
Comin' through!
My toothaloons!

09:10.425 --> 09:11.718
Yeah, they weren't
sellin' anyway.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.803
Not on my watch!

09:14.721 --> 09:16.723
Oh! The helium tank!

09:16.723 --> 09:19.225
Actually, it's kind of ironic
when you think about it.

09:21.352 --> 09:25.482
Not on my watch!

09:27.817 --> 09:30.570
Yes! The human
shield tactic never fails.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.072
Huh?

09:32.072 --> 09:34.240
Man, I knew I should've
hung on to that laser.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.742
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!

09:35.742 --> 09:37.077
Let us go again!

09:37.744 --> 09:39.329
Maybe not.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.705
(SCREAMS)

09:40.705 --> 09:42.082
I guess
they ain't called...

09:42.082 --> 09:43.458
MALE <i>ANNOUNCER:
Tuff Shoo Laysizz!</i>

09:43.458 --> 09:46.586
Prepare to be blitzed
by my inexplicable,

09:46.628 --> 09:48.755
newfound
martial arts mastery!

09:48.755 --> 09:50.340
(GRUNTING)

09:52.383 --> 09:53.843
I hate to ask,
Perry the Platypus,

09:53.843 --> 09:55.637
but have you seen
my other...

09:55.637 --> 09:57.847
Oh, there it is!

09:57.847 --> 09:59.766
Oh, yeah, that, that's
what I was planning to do.

09:59.766 --> 10:03.770
Perry the Platypus, looks
like this is the end for you!

10:03.770 --> 10:05.230
(GRUNTS)

10:05.230 --> 10:06.272
That's just not nice!

10:09.400 --> 10:09.901
(SCREAMS)

10:13.655 --> 10:15.532
Well, I hope that lands
in the backyard

10:15.532 --> 10:17.617
of a giant
who needs a fake tooth.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.790
Hey, did you say...
(IMITATES ELECTRICAL BUZZING)

10:25.542 --> 10:27.669
You know, it's kinda nice
to sit back and relax

10:27.669 --> 10:30.171
after all that
manual labor.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.548
Uh-oh! (SCREAMS)

10:32.674 --> 10:35.802
I've got a song about how Van
Stomms fall from the sky, too,

10:35.802 --> 10:38.263
but it doesn't
end well.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.681
That was so much fun!

10:39.681 --> 10:41.683
Too bad Buford
missed it all.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.685
I wonder where
he got to?

10:43.685 --> 10:45.562
Hello! Hey, Buford, are those...

10:45.562 --> 10:47.313
MALE <i>ANNOUNCER:
Tuff Shoo Laysizz!</i>

10:47.313 --> 10:49.816
Yes. Yes, they are.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.569
Right over here, Mom.
Ta-da!

10:52.569 --> 10:53.945
Hi, Mom!
Hi, Candace!

10:53.945 --> 10:56.656
What are you guys up to?
Buford, are you okay?

10:56.656 --> 10:59.325
Just puttin' my new laces
through their paces.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.703
Okay, then.
Then I'm going inside.

11:01.703 --> 11:02.954
Who wants pie?

11:02.954 --> 11:04.706
I do!
Yeah, me too!

11:04.706 --> 11:06.166
BAUEET: I always want pie.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.334
Buford, explain yourself!
Well...

11:08.334 --> 11:12.422
<i>P If we Von Stomms don't succeed
on the very first try... P</i>

11:12.422 --> 11:14.174
Then we just give up

11:16.843 --> 11:18.553
DOOFENSHMIRTZ: Just in case
anyone's wondering

11:18.553 --> 11:21.848
what happened to 0l'
Doofenshmirtz, I'm okay!

11:23.474 --> 11:25.810
Yeah, well, okay.
Well, obviously not now.
