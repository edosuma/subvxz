Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:11.345 --> 00:14.915
let's make some noise
for the Impractical Jokers!

00:18.352 --> 00:21.722
Hello, hello.
How we doing?

00:21.755 --> 00:24.358
-Whoo!

00:24.392 --> 00:26.260
Joe: Thank you
for coming out, everybody.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.395
Welcome, everyone.

00:27.428 --> 00:28.896
We're at the
Museum of American Armor,

00:28.929 --> 00:30.331
which is incredible.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.233
They got tanks.
They got all sorts of weapons.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.567
-It's amazing.

00:33.601 --> 00:36.304
But tonight, people,
tonight and tonight only,

00:36.337 --> 00:39.940
it is known
as Fort Joker!

00:41.309 --> 00:43.811
-Yes!
-Yes.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.214
We're gonna end this season
of "Impractical Jokers"

00:46.247 --> 00:48.482
in a big way --
by blowing stuff up.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.485
That's right --
this place was crazy enough

00:51.519 --> 00:55.256
to give us one of their
real working tank destroyers.

00:55.289 --> 00:56.557
Later,
we're gonna use it

00:56.590 --> 00:58.659
as part of the most
explosive punishment

00:58.692 --> 01:00.027
in "Jokers" history.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.829
They gave us a tank.

01:01.862 --> 01:02.963
That's right.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.298
You understand
what this means.

01:04.332 --> 01:06.400
There's only one thing
that that could mean,

01:06.434 --> 01:07.668
and guess what --
you're right.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.238
And tonight,
we are gonna roll out

01:10.271 --> 01:13.307
three brand-new challenges,
a second punishment,

01:13.341 --> 01:14.875
and much more.

01:14.908 --> 01:18.379
This is "Impractical Jokers
Presents G.I. Jokers."

01:18.412 --> 01:19.480
Season 6 finale.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.552
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.619
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

01:27.355 --> 01:28.956
Murr:
I want my mommy!

01:30.791 --> 01:33.494
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

01:33.527 --> 01:35.529
Joe: Larry!

01:40.401 --> 01:41.802
Whoo!

01:41.835 --> 01:43.704
We're joined by a crowd of U.S.
veterans in the audience.

01:43.737 --> 01:44.938
-Come on, guys.
-Yes.
-Yes.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.006
-Give it up.
-Come on!

01:47.408 --> 01:48.576
-And thank you guys...
-We love our vets.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.378
...you're the Armed Forces --
for your service.

01:50.411 --> 01:53.481
Thank you guys so much --
kicking butt, keeping us safe.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.015
We really appreciate it.
Thank you.

01:55.048 --> 01:58.018
Also, three vets have
volunteered for a mission --

01:58.051 --> 02:03.224
get the same tattoos
that I gave Q, Murr, and Sal.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.827
And the guys forgot
both of them right there.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.263
Yeah, there's one that
really sticks out as bad.

02:10.531 --> 02:11.965
Hey, finally, you're gonna
have a second person

02:11.999 --> 02:14.134
in your support group.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.369
I can't believe there'll be

02:15.403 --> 02:17.805
another human being
walking this earth

02:17.838 --> 02:19.507
that has
the same tattoo as me.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.941
Yeah. Neither
does Jaden Smith.

02:22.510 --> 02:25.446
Tonight, there will also be
a double military punishment.

02:25.479 --> 02:31.252
One involves the military might
of an M18 Hellcat tank.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.354
-Oh!
-There she is!

02:33.387 --> 02:35.689
-Oh, my gosh!
-Oh, my goodness.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.191
-Here it comes.
-Oh, my God.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.626
-We have a tank!
-We have a tank.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.294
We have a tank!

02:40.328 --> 02:43.431
Run for your lives!
This is so much different
than the first season.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.601
So, later tonight,
the Hellcat will demolish

02:47.635 --> 02:49.903
one of our prized
possessions.

02:51.439 --> 02:52.740
And of course,
Hellcats were designed

02:52.773 --> 02:55.676
to destroy tanks
in World War II,

02:55.709 --> 02:58.779
so whatever we put in its path,
it is gonna be gone.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.013
Q: All right, well, listen,
how about this?

03:00.047 --> 03:02.216
It's time for the first
of three challenges.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.652
So, ladies and gentlemen,
check this out.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.489
Y'all like planes?

03:08.522 --> 03:10.558
Today, we're teaming up with
the American Airpower Museum,

03:10.591 --> 03:13.193
giving presentations
on military aviation.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.563
The thing is,
our misguided presentations

03:15.596 --> 03:16.764
have been created
by the other team.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.599
At the end, we're gonna
ask this group of people

03:18.632 --> 03:21.302
to raise their hands if
they learned anything of value.

03:21.335 --> 03:24.438
Whoever gets the fewest
hands raised loses.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.206
Planes.

03:29.743 --> 03:32.613
Welcome to the
American Airpower Museum.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.518
You...
Yeah, what happened?

03:37.551 --> 03:39.186
You dressed yourself
like this.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.188
I dressed exactly
like Launchpad McQuack.

03:43.391 --> 03:44.392
Here's the difference
between me and Murr --

03:44.425 --> 03:45.526
I woke up and I was, like,

03:45.559 --> 03:47.027
"Oh, I need to something
with an airplane on,"

03:47.060 --> 03:49.497
and Murr's, like, "Oh, I have
to look like a 1920s pilot."

03:50.564 --> 03:51.765
That's funny.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.601
I woke up and just was, like,
"A regular day for me."

03:54.835 --> 03:56.069
-Hi.
-Hey, guys.

03:56.103 --> 03:57.871
Hi. My name's James.
I'm Joe.

03:57.905 --> 04:01.275
And we're going to take you
through the future of aviation.

04:01.309 --> 04:04.578
Okay.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.680
Underwater fli--

04:06.714 --> 04:08.482
Wow.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.718
"Wow" is right.
You all know submarines.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.886
Now we're going to have
planes underwater, right?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.922
This plane is going
across country, but now...

04:14.955 --> 04:16.123
-...you're...

04:16.156 --> 04:17.891
Not cross-country.

04:17.925 --> 04:18.959
What country?

04:18.992 --> 04:20.227
Intercontinental,
'cause cross-country,

04:20.260 --> 04:21.462
it wouldn't be
underwater.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.831
You don't have to worry
about turbulence,

04:23.864 --> 04:25.566
ducks...

04:25.599 --> 04:28.369
Well, actually, yeah, you might
still have to worry about ducks.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.903
Well, you have to worry
about fish.
Murr: The sharks.

04:29.937 --> 04:30.971
-Sharks.
-Sharks.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.039
Sharks are
the new ducks.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.106
Sharks are
the new ducks.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.346
Let's talk
about helicopters.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.414
They are extremely unsafe.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.883
-Yeah.
-Extremely unsafe.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.886
The design is ridiculous
of a helicopter.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.589
Just so stupid, to have
the propeller on the top.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.790
It's just a bad design.

04:49.823 --> 04:50.858
It's just not the way
planes should be.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.526
Yeah, right.
What else?

04:52.560 --> 04:53.961
Straight-up
embarrassment.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.228
A lot of people
consider them to be

04:55.262 --> 04:58.065
an embarrassment
to the aviation industry.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.200
By 2020, all helicopters
will be destroyed

05:00.233 --> 05:01.569
in a spectacular fashion,

05:01.602 --> 05:04.905
so we're just trying to, like,
basically line them all up,

05:04.938 --> 05:06.374
blow them all up
at the same time.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.211
Murr, how are you
destroying them?

05:11.244 --> 05:12.946
The way we destroy
all the helicopters --

05:12.980 --> 05:14.047
it will be spectacular.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.416
We can't go into
too many details...

05:15.449 --> 05:17.150
And it's by 2020,
so we're talking real soon.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.119
You guys are not gonna have to
worry about helicopters anymore.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.122
Yeah, but what are you guys
gonna do to destroy helicopters?

05:22.155 --> 05:24.525
So, there's going to be some
sort of a spectacular fashion.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.626
They will all be destroyed.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.027
We can't go into
the specifics, okay,

05:27.060 --> 05:28.962
but it's going to be
spectacular.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.464
Yeah.

05:30.498 --> 05:31.298
Spectacular.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.335
So...

05:35.369 --> 05:38.906
Now, the experimental
F-80X Tactical Aircraft

05:38.939 --> 05:41.442
Laser-Enhanced
Weapons Systems Demo.

05:41.475 --> 05:44.044
You are going to have your socks
knocked off by this, okay?

05:47.114 --> 05:49.383
Give it one second.
The file will load in a second.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.452
So...

05:51.485 --> 05:55.122
Hold on. It's gonna pull up.
It's a big file.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.790
Lasers are
the guns of tomorrow.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.492
There's no file.
Okay.

06:00.494 --> 06:01.629
There's not?

06:01.662 --> 06:02.730
I mean,
is this your first dance?

06:02.763 --> 06:04.031
There's not --
This is just gonna do this.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.768
Yeah, you can probably
just hit "next."

06:07.801 --> 06:08.836
Fell for that one.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.573
Here we go.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.775
Okay, so, we took a camera
out on the streets,

06:14.808 --> 06:16.444
so real New Yorkers
could ask us questions

06:16.477 --> 06:18.145
about the future of aviation,
so this is the part of it

06:18.178 --> 06:20.013
where it gets a little bit
more interactive here.

06:20.047 --> 06:23.951
I'm big fan of Chuck Yeager,
who broke the speed of sound.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.920
Do you think we will
break the speed of light,

06:26.954 --> 06:29.523
and which pilot
is the next Chuck Yeager?

06:29.557 --> 06:32.426
This is Vanessa.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.662
Vanessa works on the show,
works very hard.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.363
Half the times, I just don't
understand what she's saying.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.065
We don't understand
what she's saying.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.233
I...I didn't catch --
I didn't necessarily catch...

06:40.267 --> 06:41.469
Yeah, I'll play it again
in case you missed it,

06:41.502 --> 06:42.836
'cause the accent
is a little tough.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.337
I'm a big fan
of Chuck Yeager.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.706
A big fan of Chuck Yeager.
"I'm a big fan
of Chuck Yeager."

06:45.739 --> 06:47.140
Broke the sound.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.876
Broke the speed of sound.
Broke the speed of sound.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.343
Do you think we will break
the speed of light?

06:50.377 --> 06:51.579
Sal: Look at Joe!
We will break
the speed of light.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.046
And which pilot
will be the next Chuck Yeager?

06:53.080 --> 06:55.348
In pilot...
It's unclear.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.187
Okay.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.955
B.A.S.H. --
Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard,

07:01.989 --> 07:04.525
a collision between
bird and aircraft.

07:04.558 --> 07:07.094
It's a serious threat
to all in the air.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.930
Currently experimenting
with laser-technology solutions

07:09.963 --> 07:11.398
to help stop it.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.204
Get out of the way.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.939
If it's us or them,
get the flock out of here.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.007
He knows
what I'm talking about.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.611
That's the end.
Now...

07:23.644 --> 07:26.379
If you could please mail any
further questions you guys have

07:26.413 --> 07:29.416
to James Murray
and Dr. Joseph Gatto, DDS.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.086
I'm a dentist.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.421
We'd like to know
how many of you

07:34.454 --> 07:35.956
think you learned
something of value here today

07:35.989 --> 07:37.224
by a show of hands.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.458
-Four. Great, four.
-Four. Okay, half.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.693
-Excellent.
-That's all we could ask for.

07:39.727 --> 07:42.195
That's pretty good, buddy.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.331
-All right, everybody.

07:44.364 --> 07:47.034
Welcome to the
American Airpower Museum.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.302
I mean, Q did the "dress like
a pilot" better than you did.

07:49.336 --> 07:50.337
Here we have
the complete history

07:50.370 --> 07:52.172
of American military flight.

07:52.205 --> 07:55.008
1903 -- first flight.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.678
1919 -- the first
trans-Atlantic flight.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.413
1958 --
the Boeing 747 built.

08:00.447 --> 08:03.083
That's the plane
most people know.

08:03.116 --> 08:06.353
2010, Nicki Minaj claims
to be "as fly as a G6."

08:08.088 --> 08:12.125
It is a plane used today
that the latest and greatest,

08:12.159 --> 08:15.295
and now it is in pop culture
as Nicki Minaj.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.331
2012, claim unfounded.
It turns out --

08:18.365 --> 08:22.402
As it turns out, it took us
two years to figure out

08:22.435 --> 08:24.538
that she
is not as fly as a G6.

08:24.572 --> 08:27.274
Not as fly. Two years.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.343
Okay, so, "For once
you have tasted flight,

08:30.377 --> 08:31.478
you will walk the earth..."

08:31.511 --> 08:32.946
Oh.

08:36.449 --> 08:39.252
I knew we shouldn't have used
your personal computer for this.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.321
Do you need to, uh...

08:41.354 --> 08:43.757
I'll apply
the ointment later.

08:43.791 --> 08:47.160
So, airports. They got
Miami International Airport.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.762
There's pretty ladies there,

08:48.796 --> 08:50.931
and I actually met Pitbull
on a recent flight.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.001
If you know Pitbull,
Mr. Worldwide...

08:56.336 --> 08:58.672
Here we got
Shanghai Pudong Airport.

08:58.706 --> 09:01.341
It's a funny name --
funny name, I love that.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.910
Also, dope snacks.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.683
-Okay.
-Amsterdam Airport.

09:09.717 --> 09:10.818
-You know.
-You know.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.386
You go there, you have
yourself a good time.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.855
You'll fly before
you even get on the plane.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.389
Ha ha!

09:16.423 --> 09:17.257
Okay.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.694
Discoveries.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.263
1914 --
automatic gyrostabilizer

09:23.296 --> 09:26.199
was discovered
by Lawrence Sperry.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.469
Yes. In 1947,
the sound barrier was broken

09:29.502 --> 09:31.438
by the one and only
Chuck Yeager.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.273
**

09:34.675 --> 09:38.111
Okay, and of course, in 1986,
Danger Zone discovered,

09:38.145 --> 09:41.281
Lieutenant
Nick "Goose" Bradshaw perishes.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.853
In '86, Lieutenant
Nick "Goose" Bradshaw perishes.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.254
Murr:
Look at Q. Look at Q!

09:47.287 --> 09:48.989
Maverick bangs Charlie.

09:50.357 --> 09:53.627
That was toward
the end of the movie.

09:53.661 --> 09:57.330
Uh, first flight -- December 17,
1903 -- we mentioned that.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.598
Designer --
the Wright Brothers.

09:58.632 --> 10:01.368
You've heard of those
gentlemen, of course.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.339
I always that,

10:06.373 --> 10:08.408
if the Wright Brothers
were transgender,

10:08.441 --> 10:10.077
they'd be called
the Wrong Sisters.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.481
That's just a little
topical humor.

10:14.514 --> 10:15.615
My name's Sal Vulcano.

10:15.649 --> 10:16.650
I'll be playing
the Chuckle Hut

10:16.684 --> 10:18.686
this Saturday, 10:00 p.m.,
in Secaucus.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.222
-Oh, God.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.557
That was one
of my jokes beforehand.

10:24.591 --> 10:25.959
The mystery
of the Red Baron.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.128
Wha--

10:28.161 --> 10:30.731
Man:
Manfred Albrecht
Freiherr von Richthofen,

10:30.764 --> 10:33.133
AKA the Red Baron,

10:33.166 --> 10:36.970
was a German World War I
fighter pilot.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.608
He claimed
over 80 victories

10:41.641 --> 10:44.945
while piloting
his 3-winged triplane.

10:48.381 --> 10:52.352
Some say his spirit
still flies the skies today,

10:52.385 --> 10:54.487
haunting young pilots.

11:08.635 --> 11:09.970
Technology.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.606
What do a fake blonde
and an airplane have in common?

11:16.209 --> 11:17.845
They both have...

11:19.980 --> 11:24.051
**

11:24.084 --> 11:25.418
Q!

11:25.452 --> 11:27.654
They both have a black box.
Now, what do I mean by that?

11:29.389 --> 11:31.024
You guys can find out
what that means

11:31.058 --> 11:32.225
10:00 p.m. in Secaucus

11:32.259 --> 11:33.326
this Saturday
at the Chuckle Hut.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.297
Oh, Chuck Yeager facts.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.132
Maybe you all remember
Chuck Yeager.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.633
Yeager would frequently
order a coffee,

11:40.667 --> 11:43.871
then when asked if he took it
with milk or sugar respond,

11:43.904 --> 11:46.373
"No thanks,
I'm a black guy."

11:47.975 --> 11:51.611
Yeager then said he was
just kidding and request skim.

11:51.644 --> 11:52.712
-So...
-That was a...

11:55.182 --> 11:57.184
-Not quite sure what he meant...
-I don't know.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.887
...with that,
because that's not a...

11:59.920 --> 12:02.255
Oh, he means
black coffee.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.490
Oh. Oh,
"I'm a black coffee guy."

12:03.523 --> 12:04.758
Like I'm an iced tea guy.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.994
Ohh, that makes
a lot more sense.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.363
These are not
what you're gonna get from me

12:10.397 --> 12:12.599
at the Chuckle Hut.
Oh, he's got a tight 15.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.634
That's 10:00 p.m. Saturday,
Secaucus.

12:16.870 --> 12:17.938
So, in conclusion...

12:17.971 --> 12:19.439
Uh.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.443
By a show of hands...

12:23.476 --> 12:25.012
By a show of hands,
how many of you feel

12:25.045 --> 12:26.980
like you've learned
something informative

12:27.014 --> 12:28.615
that you can take
with you here today?

12:28.648 --> 12:30.017
One, two, three, four?

12:30.050 --> 12:32.485
-It's a tie. Well done, guys.
-Well, there you go.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.288
All right.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.257
No thumbs down.
Well, no thumbs down
on that loser board,

12:37.290 --> 12:39.392
so everybody is safe
as of right now.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.794
All right.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.329
Get ready for one
of our prized possessions

12:42.362 --> 12:43.696
to go up in flames.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.933
And we'll see how
the tattooed vets are doing,

12:45.966 --> 12:47.200
right after this.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.871
-Whoo, whoo.
-Whoo-hoo!

12:53.473 --> 12:58.245
We are back to our big season
finale here at Fort Joker.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.380
Three veterans from
the Wounded Warriors Project

13:00.413 --> 13:04.051
volunteered to get the same
tattoo that these guys got.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.253
Let's meet
these brave souls.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.387
-Whoo!
-Here they are.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.555
-Oh, there they are!
-Oh, yo.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.791
-Hello, fellas.
-Oh, my God.

13:11.825 --> 13:14.027
Hey, first we have
Manny Figureto,

13:14.061 --> 13:16.229
a Marine who served
as a machine-gunner

13:16.263 --> 13:19.232
and a driver in the
6th Motor Transport Battalion.

13:19.266 --> 13:23.670
He'll be getting my tattoo --
38, Lives Alone, Has 3 Cats.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.405
-Manny.
There he is.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.340
Now, does any of that
apply to you at all?

13:27.374 --> 13:29.742
Are you 38?
Uh, no, I'm not.

13:29.776 --> 13:32.045
Do you live alone?
Uh, no, I don't.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.547
Do you --
Manny, do you have any cats?

13:34.581 --> 13:35.715
-I'm allergic to cats.
-Oh.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.320
What made you do this?

13:40.353 --> 13:41.688
I want to be like Q
when I grow up.

13:41.721 --> 13:42.522
-Oh.
-Oh! There you go.

13:42.555 --> 13:43.590
All right.

13:43.623 --> 13:46.059
Well, next up is my guy,
Chris Moran,

13:46.093 --> 13:47.694
who served
as an army sergeant

13:47.727 --> 13:49.562
with the
25th Infantry Division.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.232
He's getting
my skydiving ferret.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.234
-I'm doing good.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.669
Have you thought of what
it's like to get a massage

13:56.703 --> 13:58.271
with a ferret on your leg?

13:58.305 --> 13:59.639
No, I haven't.
You haven't?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.408
He doesn't look like you
where he goes into the city

14:01.441 --> 14:02.775
and gets a massage
twice a week.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.544
That's a man.
He hits the gym.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.714
Sal: I-I got to tell you,
you look really comfortable.

14:07.747 --> 14:08.916
Thank you.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.251
I mean, he's got a needle
in his leg right now.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.685
-You would never know it.
-No.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.254
Well, look at his arms.
He's been there before.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.355
-Yeah, yeah, right.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.856
All right.
Very good, Chris.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.558
-We'll see you in a little bit.
-I appreciate it. Thank you.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.194
Well, all right,
last but not least,

14:21.228 --> 14:24.264
getting my
Will Smith's son tattoo...

14:24.297 --> 14:26.733
-Yeah!
-...is Greg Hancock,

14:26.766 --> 14:29.736
who served as
a Navy 3rd Class Petty Officer.

14:29.769 --> 14:32.172
Hey, Greg.
Hey, what's up?

14:32.205 --> 14:33.540
You're a good man.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.977
I want to be
just like you, too.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.511
How you doing?
How you making out so far?

14:38.545 --> 14:40.480
It's a little bit sore,
but I figure after this,

14:40.513 --> 14:43.150
I'm gonna run for president
of Jaden Smith's fan club.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.584
All right.

14:44.617 --> 14:45.785
Let's hear it
for our volunteers, guys.

14:45.818 --> 14:48.155
-Thanks, guys.
-All right. Very cool.

14:49.156 --> 14:50.423
Our audience tonight features

14:50.457 --> 14:51.458
other veterans
and family members

14:51.491 --> 14:52.792
from
the Wounded Warriors Project.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.194
It's an amazing organization

14:54.227 --> 14:56.596
that honors and empowers
injured service members.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.732
And we recently spent some time
at a Wounded Warriors event.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.734
Let's take a look
at what happened.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.570
**

15:03.603 --> 15:05.572
-Hi, everybody.

15:05.605 --> 15:06.639
-Hi.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.375
Hello, hello.
Hey, everybody.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.179
Chris? Joe.
Good to see you.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.314
What do you got,
Jersey on your neck?

15:14.347 --> 15:16.583
Oh. Yeah,
I got Staten Island.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.851
Ben, it's Murr
from "Impractical Jokers."

15:18.885 --> 15:20.753
I got your note.
It's awesome, buddy.

15:20.787 --> 15:22.789
I just wanted you to know
you're my favorite.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.524
I'm gonna brag about it
to all the guys.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.926
How are you?
Yeah, no, good.
We're talking grenades.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.929
Yeah, I'd appreciate you guys
making us laugh, too,

15:29.963 --> 15:31.864
you know what I mean?
Honestly, that's what we need.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.700
You like the show?
Yeah?

15:33.733 --> 15:35.002
-You have something right here.
-Uh, where --

15:35.035 --> 15:36.269
Oh! You got me.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.438
There's lots going on here --

15:38.471 --> 15:40.240
people meeting and greeting
and hanging out.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.409
You see it right here,
a bunch of people shaking hands,

15:42.442 --> 15:43.776
giving hugs --
this is what happens.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.445
Know the angle and the lighting,
two most important things.

15:45.478 --> 15:46.813
Yes.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.218
There you go.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.153
We are really happy
to have you up here

15:53.186 --> 15:54.854
on behalf of the
Wounded Warrior Project.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.223
I can't thank you enough.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.790
Sal: Please,
it's an honor to be here.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.526
It's a pleasure
to meet you guys.

15:59.559 --> 16:00.860
Really, like, it's --

16:00.893 --> 16:02.062
You really don't
have to thank us for this.

16:02.095 --> 16:04.231
This is something
that we enjoyed.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.199
We're so happy to be here.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.701
-And thank you, guys.
-Thank you. Yep.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.970
Nancy, we also
actually have...

16:11.004 --> 16:13.773
-Oh, we brought a big check.
-Yeah.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.176
-We don't do anything small.
-We brought...

16:16.209 --> 16:18.145
This is from James Murray's
personal bank account.
Yes, it is.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.580
Yes, it does say that.
This is what --

16:20.613 --> 16:21.914
We ripped this out of
his actual checkbook.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.150
-Yeah.
-He uses large checks.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.286
This is a gift from truTV
to your organization

16:26.319 --> 16:27.454
for all you do.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.921
So thank you so much
on behalf of, uh...

16:28.955 --> 16:30.057
Oh, thank you.
Thanks for
your service, everybody.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.291
This means a lot.
Thank you.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.959
-Good work, guys.
-Thank you, guys.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.294
We really should
have a talk about this.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.764
Now's the time we start
the dance battle, so...

16:40.533 --> 16:42.302
Everybody wave at the camera
for the big finish.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.338
-Yay!
-Yay!

16:46.673 --> 16:49.142
Yes!

16:49.176 --> 16:51.811
What a great organization.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.246
We're very proud
to have been a part of it,

16:53.280 --> 16:54.547
and we hope you guys
help them out, too.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.149
Sal: All right, let's check
out the next challenge

16:56.183 --> 17:00.720
where we aim for glory
with the help of Old Glory.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.755
And if you don't know
what Old Glory is,

17:02.789 --> 17:05.258
that's a nickname that
we give to the flag --

17:05.292 --> 17:06.693
Yeah, they -- they get it.
You're over-explaining it.

17:06.726 --> 17:07.827
-They know this one.
-I was just making sure.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.062
We use flags in it.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.830
Most of these people are
connected to the military.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.066
-They know what Old Glory is.
-They know what Old Glory is.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.168
Well, I'm nothing
if I'm not thorough.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.936
This is a challenge
we call "Put Pocketing."

17:16.969 --> 17:18.205
Let's take a look.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.539
Today, we're
at Food Bazaar,

17:19.572 --> 17:21.541
trying to sneak as many
American flags as we can

17:21.574 --> 17:23.643
onto unsuspecting
shoppers.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.612
As they shop, we'll try to get
as many as we can

17:25.645 --> 17:27.880
onto their person
without getting caught.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.817
Whoever puts the least amount
of flags on a person loses.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.385
U.S.A.!

17:32.419 --> 17:33.820
-U.S.A.!
-U.S.A.!

17:33.853 --> 17:35.622
-U.S.A.!
-U.S.A.!

17:35.655 --> 17:36.889
-U.S.A.!
-U.S.A.!

17:36.923 --> 17:38.225
-U.S.A.!
-U.S.A.!

17:38.258 --> 17:39.926
Shh, shh, they're gonna
know we're filming.
Oh.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.961
**

17:43.563 --> 17:46.099
Ooh, it's cold.
It's not good for the nipples.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.534
-Yes, buddy.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.602
You want to get the  back
up here and put your wig on?

17:49.636 --> 17:53.473
Yes. Yes!

17:53.506 --> 17:54.907
I wouldn't have even
realized it.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.109
Son of a...

17:56.143 --> 17:57.610
Now we know everyone
needs to be on high alert.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.912
-That's right.
-This got past 50 people.

17:59.946 --> 18:01.581
That's right.
Good thing I'm here.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.416
-That's better.
-Yippee.

18:04.484 --> 18:09.456
Oh, he's got
a good back pocket.

18:09.489 --> 18:10.790
I don't know. I wouldn't go
for the back pocket.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.192
It's got a wallet in it.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.427
-Oh.
-Oh, no way.

18:15.528 --> 18:16.629
-Ohh!
-Ohh!

18:16.663 --> 18:18.231
-There's one.
-Prove me wrong.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.667
That was an easy drop
because his ass was out.

18:20.700 --> 18:25.205
**

18:25.238 --> 18:27.340
-Ohh.
-Ooh.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.775
-Ooh.
-The winds have changed.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.210
Look at this guy.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.545
She caught him putting
the flags on him.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.282
Dos.
-Whoa!

18:35.315 --> 18:36.082
Wow.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.450
Murr's in for two.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.152
**

18:39.186 --> 18:40.920
Murr's in for three.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.789
Murr's in for three!

18:42.822 --> 18:44.691
Oh. Ah!

18:44.724 --> 18:46.759
Does this guy have no nerve
endings in his butt?

18:46.793 --> 18:48.961
No, he's got that wallet,
like, helping him out.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.730
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.799
-Oh, oh, Murr's got obstacles.
-Got a traffic jam.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.268
You got a traffic jam
here, Murr, for three.

18:56.869 --> 18:57.837
-Oh!
-Oh, my God.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.539
-Four.
-Four's gonna be tough.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.241
Now we're getting into
tough to beat.
This is admirable.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.843
**

19:03.876 --> 19:05.144
-Yeah.
-Four is tough to beat.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.380
-Five.
-Five.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.749
Oh, he's on a tear.
He's just loading him up.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.419
-Oh, oh! Yes!
-Oh, my God.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.055
You got greedy.
You got greedy.

19:16.088 --> 19:17.990
You could've left it
at four.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.826
You're back to zero,
buddy.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.461
Here we go.
Here we go.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.631
**

19:24.664 --> 19:25.832
Oh!

19:27.033 --> 19:28.167
-She's on the phone.
-She's got a double --

19:28.201 --> 19:30.870
Joe: She's got
a double-hood setup.

19:30.903 --> 19:34.641
-Oh! There's one!
-Yeah, all right, there's one.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.109
Here you go, Murr.
Going for two.

19:37.143 --> 19:38.645
-Oh.
-Oh, my God.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.681
-Yeah! Got two!
-Oh, my God!

19:41.714 --> 19:44.217
First of all, she looks an like
American-flag Frankenstein.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.418
They're jutting out of
the sides of her neck.

19:47.654 --> 19:50.690
Flagenstein.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.159
That should've got
more props.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.394
If you saw my face,
I gave you props on that.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.562
-Great, great.
-Nice.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.630
I'll watch it back.

19:57.664 --> 19:58.865
Look at this.
Look at this!

20:01.033 --> 20:02.735
-Ohh.
-Ohh.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.471
What -- By the way, who has
a conversation,

20:04.504 --> 20:06.306
-a full conversation...
-At the eggs.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.775
...just, with your face
a foot from eggs and meat?

20:08.808 --> 20:11.010
Like, who does that?
Look, she's...

20:11.043 --> 20:12.712
Murray, you're
getting brazen, Murray.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.514
What's this, four?

20:14.547 --> 20:16.215
-He nosed her, to boot!
-Wow!

20:16.249 --> 20:18.851
Nice.
And she's still Flagenstein.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.287
-Look at your creation.
-Wow.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.322
He looks like Dr. Flagenstein
with that hand.

20:23.623 --> 20:24.757
And she's gone.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.626
-Yes!
-Yeah!

20:26.659 --> 20:29.696
-Four -- he got.
-Not bad. Not bad.

20:29.729 --> 20:30.730
Okay, fellas.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.732
-Joey Gatto.
-All right, Joey.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.567
Sticking flags
in strangers.

20:34.601 --> 20:35.968
Joey, you're
looking svelte, baby.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.137
Yeah, you know what?
I'm a little worried,

20:38.170 --> 20:40.707
because your belly's like
the source of your power.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.509
Yeah, I know.
My core.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.979
Here we go.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.482
-Oh!
-Oh...Ah!

20:49.516 --> 20:52.184
Murr: Oh! Expertly done.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.921
He's got
a very soft touch.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.756
You know,
I don't know what it is.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.425
I need an egg
in my house.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.727
Two.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.863
-Oh!
-Oh!

21:03.896 --> 21:06.933
-Oh, oh, oh, he -- Oh!
-Ohh!

21:08.968 --> 21:10.069
Oh, ho, ho.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.771
Well done, Joseph.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.272
I can't see. Are the flags
still in the pocket?

21:13.306 --> 21:15.575
She's still in the pocket.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.576
Joe: Don't say nothing.
Don't say...

21:16.609 --> 21:17.577
-Ohh!
-Ohh!

21:17.610 --> 21:18.645
What did you
do that for?

21:18.678 --> 21:20.780
-We had a thing!
-You got caught, bubba.

21:22.349 --> 21:24.016
I can't believe
you sold me out.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.687
You don't get grossed out
putting this on

21:27.720 --> 21:28.755
for the last six months?

21:28.788 --> 21:29.889
Yeah, I'm getting
grossed out slightly.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.791
My concern
is the actual...

21:31.824 --> 21:33.292
Well, I always do --
that I combed it.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.027
I just felt it
for the first time.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.096
Feels dirty and matted.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.399
It's gross.
That is gross.

21:39.432 --> 21:43.002
I have
the full-body chills.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.338
-Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
-Oh, oh!

21:45.372 --> 21:48.040
Oh, this is --
this is tricky, Joseph.

21:48.074 --> 21:51.978
**

21:53.813 --> 21:55.548
Now she's very
suspicious.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.116
Pumpkin.
I didn't know it was pumpkin.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.451
Yes, and the beans.
I didn't know
they sold that here.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.452
Oh, you did the beans?

22:01.754 --> 22:04.624
-Five flags.
-All right.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.858
**

22:05.892 --> 22:07.494
-Oh, oh, oh.
-Ohh!

22:07.527 --> 22:09.095
That pocketbook --
side pocketbook,

22:09.128 --> 22:10.262
which is weird.

22:10.296 --> 22:12.365
-Oh, oh!
-With this pocketbook...

22:12.399 --> 22:13.533
Joe!
-It's too many. It's too many!

22:13.566 --> 22:14.834
Oh, he's got it. He's got it!
He's got it!

22:14.867 --> 22:15.802
-It's too many.
-Oh!

22:15.835 --> 22:16.936
Q: She didn't catch him!

22:16.969 --> 22:18.170
Thanks, babe.

22:18.204 --> 22:20.407
-Oh!
-Oh! Oh!

22:20.440 --> 22:21.874
Oh! Oh, she found it.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.275
-She found it!
-Oh!

22:23.309 --> 22:24.343
You take them.
That's for you.

22:24.377 --> 22:26.345
She kept them!
You get the points!

22:26.379 --> 22:27.680
You know it.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.115
Well done.

22:32.385 --> 22:35.722
We'll see how many flags Q and I
can sneak in after the break.

22:35.755 --> 22:39.058
Also, the Hellcat
is quiet for now,

22:39.091 --> 22:40.760
but, soon,
it'll come to life

22:40.793 --> 22:44.230
and help lay one of our
prized possessions to rest

22:44.263 --> 22:45.532
when we return.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.570
-There you go. T-shirts!
-Hey!

22:50.603 --> 22:52.972
**

22:54.974 --> 22:56.175
Murr: Yeah!

22:56.208 --> 22:58.244
All right!

22:58.277 --> 22:59.946
All right, welcome back

22:59.979 --> 23:02.482
to "Impractical Jokers
Presents G.I. Jokers,"

23:02.515 --> 23:03.950
our big finale special

23:03.983 --> 23:06.318
coming to you from
the Museum of American Armor,

23:06.352 --> 23:08.054
AKA Fort Joker.

23:08.087 --> 23:10.389
While we're out here, Joe is
inside with the three veterans

23:10.423 --> 23:11.758
getting our tattoos.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.860
Joey, how's it going, bud?

23:13.893 --> 23:15.261
Joey. Joey!

23:15.294 --> 23:16.896
-It's going -- It's going great.
-Joey!

23:18.364 --> 23:19.566
Back to you.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.000
-No, no, no.
-No, no, Joe!

23:21.033 --> 23:22.935
Sal: Joe, we want a little
investigative reporting.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.203
-Come on.
-Oh, okay.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.072
Um, I'm back here,
and it's going great.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.407
-Joe, you...
-Back to you guys.

23:28.441 --> 23:29.742
Give it --
Give us a little...

23:29.776 --> 23:32.912
Stop throwing back to us.
We want a little information.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.681
Thanks, guys, this is Joe,
reporting live.

23:34.714 --> 23:35.582
Back to you.

23:35.615 --> 23:36.916
You're just...

23:36.949 --> 23:38.918
You're not a good
field reporter, Joe!

23:38.951 --> 23:41.688
I know! I know, 'cause I'm not
a field reporter, guys.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.122
There's a lot of pressure.
I'm by myself.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.791
There's a lot of lights.
I'm wearing a jacket.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.826
It's hot.
I'm starting to sweat.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.294
Sal: Joe,
take the jacket off.

23:48.327 --> 23:51.764
I can't, because my pants --
I got a situation, okay?

23:52.799 --> 23:54.133
-You -- You can't...
-All right.

23:54.166 --> 23:57.169
-Back to you!

23:57.203 --> 23:59.371
-Anything! K-Keep...
-Back to you!

23:59.405 --> 24:02.475
No detail, no nothing!
You can always walk -- Just --

24:02.509 --> 24:04.210
Let's see how fast
this cameraman is.

24:04.243 --> 24:06.513
Back to you!
Back to you!

24:06.546 --> 24:08.014
Joe...
He's actually pretty fast.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.181
-Joe.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.651
Somebody's calling for you.
It's, uh...Larry?

24:11.684 --> 24:13.085
-Yeah.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.054
Oh, I got to go.
Back to you.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.656
All right, give him
a hand, everybody.

24:16.689 --> 24:17.957
Give him a hand.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.527
Q: All right. Let's get back
to Put Pocketing.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.161
I think Sal and I,
we go now, right?

24:22.194 --> 24:24.230
Yes, that's right.
Yeah, let's check this out,
everybody.

24:26.365 --> 24:29.201
-Here's...
-Here he goes.

24:29.235 --> 24:32.271
He's got
a bunch in his hand.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.405
What -- Oh.
-Oh!

24:34.707 --> 24:36.809
Ohh!

24:36.843 --> 24:37.910
Joe: Well, two --
you still some in.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.245
Hold on.
You got residual flags.

24:39.278 --> 24:40.880
You got two flags in.
Q.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.349
She's still in play, bud.
She hasn't noticed.

24:43.382 --> 24:44.851
They are still in place.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.453
Now they're not.

24:47.486 --> 24:51.090
Oh, wow. He went
from five to two to zero.

24:51.123 --> 24:53.993
**

24:54.026 --> 24:55.995
-Here he goes.
-Oh. Oh!

24:57.229 --> 25:00.299
-Wow.
-One, right in the pink pock.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.535
-Oh. Oh.
-Oh.

25:02.569 --> 25:04.070
-And the kid sees.
-Oh, the kid sees!

25:04.103 --> 25:05.104
-Oh!
-Oh!

25:05.137 --> 25:06.539
There's the kid!

25:06.573 --> 25:12.044
Oh, the kid is deciding
whether she has morals or not.

25:14.647 --> 25:15.982
Look at the kid.
Look at the kid!

25:16.015 --> 25:17.349
-She --
-You've got an accomplice.

25:17.383 --> 25:19.285
She has given her allegiance
to the stranger.

25:19.318 --> 25:20.553
Yes.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.021
Tell you what, I would rob
a bank with this kid.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.289
**

25:23.322 --> 25:24.857
Good positioning.

25:24.891 --> 25:25.958
-Oh.
-Oh!

25:25.992 --> 25:29.929
Much better.
That's four.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.831
-Oh, Yes!
-Oh!

25:31.864 --> 25:33.499
She didn't see it!
She didn't see it! Leave 'em!

25:35.001 --> 25:35.968
Oh!

25:36.002 --> 25:37.670
I saw her.
I saw her.

25:37.704 --> 25:40.039
She kept taking these
out of my thing

25:40.072 --> 25:41.373
and putting them
in your pocketbook.

25:41.407 --> 25:42.441
Was I-I...

25:47.680 --> 25:49.215
No, wait, I did it.
I'm only joking.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.883
-I'm only joking!
-Oh, my God.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.184
It's a joke.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.986
-Oh, my God.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.922
This has not happened
in six seasons.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.757
I didn't mean
to upset you, sweetheart.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.959
It's for a TV show, sweetie.
It's for a game show.

25:59.992 --> 26:02.161
Q, say, "We're gonna
give you $100."

26:02.194 --> 26:03.830
We're gonna give you
100 bucks.

26:05.632 --> 26:07.199
Give her --
Just give her money, bud.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.001
Here, look. Here we go.
Stop crying. Here.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.269
You won 100 bucks.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.871
Do you know what the salt
in the wound is?

26:11.904 --> 26:13.405
-She got your back.
-Yeah.

26:13.439 --> 26:14.674
She had your back!

26:14.707 --> 26:16.008
She wasn't even
ratting you out!

26:16.042 --> 26:17.509
I know. That's why
I'm paying her off!

26:17.543 --> 26:20.446
Then you turn around and do
a double-cross on the kid!

26:20.479 --> 26:22.481
Take it, take it.
There you go, sweetheart.

26:22.514 --> 26:23.850
-Yeah!
-There you go!

26:23.883 --> 26:25.251
-She took the money!
-She took the money.

26:25.284 --> 26:28.520
She's being rolled away into
the sunset as she's crying.

26:28.554 --> 26:30.089
You're killing me, sweetheart.
You're killing me.

26:30.122 --> 26:33.392
Give me a thumbs up
so I can sleep tonight.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.829
She's a tough customer.
She's a tough customer.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.130
Wave, wave, wave,
baby, wave.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.666
-Come on, come on.
-Wave.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.268
-Yeah! Whoo!
-Yeah!

26:43.703 --> 26:46.538
Murr: No kids were hurt in the
making of this TV show.

26:46.572 --> 26:47.807
Well, what does this mean?

26:47.840 --> 26:49.375
Means you got a zero,
but we can sleep at night.

26:49.408 --> 26:50.843
Well, I'm out 100 bucks.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.945
This girl's laughing
all the way to the bank.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.047
**

26:55.081 --> 26:58.384
I'm out of butter.
This is three pounds of butter.

26:58.417 --> 26:59.652
Yep.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.888
What home that's not
a restaurant uses this?

27:03.322 --> 27:05.091
Joe: Here you go.

27:05.124 --> 27:08.360
**

27:08.394 --> 27:09.762
Organics over here?

27:09.796 --> 27:10.663
-Oh, he snuck it in.
-Oh, got one.

27:10.697 --> 27:12.231
-The organics.
-Well done.

27:12.264 --> 27:13.866
-One.
-The old organics play.

27:13.900 --> 27:16.035
Yo, they're meatless.
Can you believe that?

27:16.068 --> 27:18.905
They do it like
a vegetable type of stock.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.439
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah, yeah.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.908
-Yeah, vegetables.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.609
And then you got over here,
you got, uh...

27:23.642 --> 27:25.011
Oh!

27:25.044 --> 27:28.748
**

27:28.781 --> 27:30.216
Over here,
you got butters.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.951
-Yeah, there you go.
-All right. All right.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.185
I get the twin pack,

27:33.219 --> 27:34.253
'cause otherwise,
I'm not gonna have enough.

27:34.286 --> 27:35.321
That's two flags.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.423
**

27:37.456 --> 27:38.925
Actually, the twin pack
is too much butter.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.760
-Oh, well done!
-Nice.

27:40.793 --> 27:42.528
He's got three in.

27:42.561 --> 27:45.297
You look like a ninja
out there.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.066
I am a  big,
fat, white ninja.

27:49.135 --> 27:50.837
-Oh, oh, oh!
-Oh, oh!

27:50.870 --> 27:53.239
Joe: He's down the aisle.

27:53.272 --> 27:54.573
Yeah, that's it.
Go, go!

27:54.606 --> 27:56.108
Oh, oh, oh!
It's wide open!

27:56.142 --> 27:57.143
**

27:58.377 --> 27:59.678
-Progresso.
-Well done.

27:59.712 --> 28:01.313
-Snuck it right in.
-There it is -- the Progresso.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.715
He hunted him down.

28:02.749 --> 28:04.851
You wanted a different
Progresso soup, hon?

28:04.884 --> 28:05.985
Oh, .

28:06.018 --> 28:07.219
-Oh!
-Oh!

28:09.555 --> 28:11.958
I got a quick
problem solver.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.292
Okay.

28:13.325 --> 28:16.428
He's
He's taping them up.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.865
You're making
a mega flag.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.166
-Nine.
-Nine.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.334
Now you need to find
somebody with a fat hole.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.906
**

28:26.939 --> 28:30.309
Oh, my God,
is he gonna win right now?

28:30.342 --> 28:32.678
**

28:33.913 --> 28:35.782
-Oh!
-You know if this is, uh...

28:35.815 --> 28:37.149
for, uh, sloppy joes?

28:37.183 --> 28:39.218
-Wow.
-Wow.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.586
Her head's hitting it.

28:40.619 --> 28:42.121
-Come on.
-Come on, lady.

28:42.154 --> 28:44.290
There's a bundle of flags
in your hood.

28:44.323 --> 28:45.892
Wake up, sister.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.559
Ah, ah.

28:47.593 --> 28:50.062
Get out. Get out.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.163
Get out!

28:51.197 --> 28:52.298
Joe: And she's gone!

28:52.331 --> 28:53.332
-Oh!
-Oh!

28:53.365 --> 28:55.167
-Sal wins it.
-That was too easy.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.436
Ingenuity wins the day.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.906
-Whoo!
-Oh, boy.

28:59.939 --> 29:02.374
Come on, look who
has no losses so far!

29:02.408 --> 29:05.444
Joe: Oh, not good.
Not good for us.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.880
All right, coming up,
we'll see the finished tattoos.

29:07.914 --> 29:10.983
Also, not one, but two
punishments coming up next.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.321
**

29:18.825 --> 29:20.259
-There we go.
-Hey, hey.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.061
-Here we go.
-We are back.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.931
Welcome back, everyone.
The tattoos are done...
Yes!

29:24.964 --> 29:26.398
...so let's see
how they turned out.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.867
Here we go.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.269
All right, first up is Manny,
who got my tattoo --

29:30.302 --> 29:32.805
38, Lives Alone,
Has 3 Cats.

29:32.839 --> 29:34.740
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Manny!

29:34.773 --> 29:37.276
Manny!

29:37.309 --> 29:39.411
All right, Manny.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.347
-Oh, my God.
-There she is.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.614
-Ah.
-Oh.

29:42.648 --> 29:45.184
-Hold on.
-Oh, my God.

29:45.217 --> 29:48.320
There you go --
side by side.

29:48.354 --> 29:49.755
Yeah, that's perfect.

29:49.788 --> 29:50.990
So, how do you feel?

29:51.023 --> 29:53.359
Like, how are you gonna
explain this to people?

29:53.392 --> 29:55.027
I'm just gonna say "Q."
That's it.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.428
And you think
they're gonna know?

29:56.462 --> 29:58.397
No.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.099
We'll pretend, though.
Absolutely.
Yeah!

30:00.132 --> 30:01.533
Sal: All right,
let's see the next tattoo.

30:01.567 --> 30:02.869
Let's see it, then.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.036
Murr:
Next up is my boy, Chris,

30:04.070 --> 30:06.472
who got the tattoo
of my skydiving ferret.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.007
-Chris, come on up.
-Here you go.

30:11.243 --> 30:13.880
All right, ready for this?
Here we go.

30:13.913 --> 30:17.416
Oh, my God!
It looks just like it!

30:17.449 --> 30:19.886
All right,
let's do a comparison, shall we?

30:22.955 --> 30:24.123
-Thank God.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.224
Do you have underwear?

30:25.257 --> 30:26.492
I thank God I wore
underwear tonight.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.694
-Okay, great.
-All right, here we go.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.498
Oh, my God. That's exact!

30:32.531 --> 30:33.765
Q: Hey,
I don't want to --

30:33.799 --> 30:35.301
I don't want to say
anything, Murr,

30:35.334 --> 30:37.269
but, uh...his is bigger --
that's all I'm saying!

30:38.604 --> 30:39.771
-That's all I'm saying.
-Yes, well, you know...

30:39.805 --> 30:41.040
That's all I'm saying.

30:41.073 --> 30:42.141
-Very good, my friend.
-There you go.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.209
-Very good. There we go.
-Appreciate it.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.410
Let's hear it
for him.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.715
All right, all right.

30:49.748 --> 30:53.019
Finally, we have Greg,
who got my tattoo.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.786
Give it up for Greg,
everybody.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.124
I cannot wait
to see this, buddy.

30:58.157 --> 31:01.693
How you doing? Okay.
Let me see this.

31:01.727 --> 31:04.330
Oh, my God.

31:04.363 --> 31:07.299
Oh, my God.

31:07.333 --> 31:08.800
I love it!

31:08.834 --> 31:10.269
Oh, my God,
it looks better than mine.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.740
All right, listen, this is
a little fun tip for you.

31:14.773 --> 31:16.875
Now you have this, you got to
have fun with it in life.

31:16.909 --> 31:19.045
So, like, you're at a barbecue,
people don't know you have it.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.980
Just start talking
about Jaden Smith

31:21.013 --> 31:22.448
until the people
can't take it anymore.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.283
They'll say, "What are you --
obsessed with Jaden Smith?"

31:24.316 --> 31:25.952
You say, "Yeah,
I'm his number-one fan."

31:25.985 --> 31:27.486
And then, like,
"I got a tattoo of him."

31:27.519 --> 31:29.388
They won't believe you,
okay?

31:29.421 --> 31:31.924
The barbecue will
start to quiet down.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.159
All eyes will be on you.

31:33.192 --> 31:34.293
You pull that out,
you show them.

31:34.326 --> 31:35.928
They won't know
how to react.

31:35.962 --> 31:38.230
All of a sudden, you're
in control of the barbecue.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.470
Murr: There we go!

31:44.503 --> 31:46.538
Oh, this is insane.

31:46.572 --> 31:51.243
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

31:51.277 --> 31:52.411
Oh, my God!

31:52.444 --> 31:53.845
Joe: A double pouty
Jaden Smith combo.

31:53.879 --> 31:56.048
-Oh, my God.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.584
Guys, let's give it up
for our friends here

31:58.617 --> 32:00.586
and the amazing tattoo artists
at East Side Ink

32:00.619 --> 32:01.587
for the work they did.

32:01.620 --> 32:02.888
They're so great.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.523
All right, everybody.

32:04.556 --> 32:06.225
It is time for
the final challenge,

32:06.258 --> 32:08.727
and this is definitely one
that's award-worthy.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.229
Check it out.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.930
Today, we're in the park
asking strangers

32:11.964 --> 32:14.533
if they'd like to shake
the hand of a decorated hero.

32:14.566 --> 32:16.402
The catch is the award
we've been given

32:16.435 --> 32:18.004
has been made up
by the other guys.

32:18.037 --> 32:20.939
If we can't get someone to shake
your heroic hands, you lose.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.741
In the military,
they get Medals of Honor.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.376
On "Impractical Jokers,"
we get Plaques of Embarrassment.

32:25.477 --> 32:26.745
That's all we deserve.

32:26.778 --> 32:31.150
**

32:31.183 --> 32:33.319
-Okay, Sal's in.
-Excuse me.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.654
I don't know if you guys want
to shake the hand of a hero,

32:35.687 --> 32:37.356
but check out this thing
I got at work.

32:37.389 --> 32:40.026
-This is not a hero's award.
-No.

32:40.059 --> 32:43.429
Oh.
9 shifts, no piss, Office Hut.

32:44.896 --> 32:48.400
-I know.
-He said, "I know."

32:48.434 --> 32:49.801
Yeah, I know .

32:50.802 --> 32:52.271
Everyone
was competing for it,

32:52.304 --> 32:54.306
'cause you get
a little bit of a bonus...
Oh, okay.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.574
...so the whole crew
had UTIs at this point,

32:55.607 --> 32:56.808
'cause no one's going.

32:56.842 --> 32:57.943
-Yeah.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.145
"You want to know
how I do it?

32:59.178 --> 33:00.612
I start each day
by eating a sponge."

33:02.081 --> 33:04.150
I-It's cutthroat, though.

33:04.183 --> 33:05.984
And I use certain techniques --
I didn't tell them.

33:06.018 --> 33:08.287
Like I started every day
by eating a little sponge.

33:10.022 --> 33:12.791
"At first, I just used
rubber bands, but, uh..."
That didn't work.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.126
"...that didn't work out
like I wanted."

33:14.160 --> 33:17.229
At first I just used, like,
rubber bands...
Mm-hmm.

33:17.263 --> 33:18.630
...but that didn't
work out like I wanted.

33:21.133 --> 33:24.936
"I should mention
I  four times."

33:24.970 --> 33:27.806
I should mention
I  four times.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.409
**

33:35.747 --> 33:37.349
Yeah.

33:37.383 --> 33:40.018
Four times, but they don't
give an award for that, so...

33:44.022 --> 33:46.658
All right, bud, remember --
you have to get the handshake.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.227
I don't know if you guys want to
shake the hand of a hero here,

33:48.260 --> 33:49.861
but...

33:50.962 --> 33:52.464
-Ah!
-Ah!

33:52.498 --> 33:53.799
Yeah, so,
I'm just sitting here

33:53.832 --> 33:55.067
talking about  and piss
while you guys eat lunch.

33:55.101 --> 33:56.235
Apologies on that one.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.472
I'm having a good day,
by the way.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.308
I got an award.

34:02.341 --> 34:03.675
Thank you so much.
You want to see it?

34:03.709 --> 34:05.111
Here you go.
Here you go. Here you go.

34:05.144 --> 34:08.747
It's, uh, Esten's Cleaners --
Most Stains Removed Orally.

34:08.780 --> 34:09.848
Uh-huh.

34:11.517 --> 34:13.319
Yeah, I know.

34:13.352 --> 34:14.720
Q: "What does that mean?
Good question.

34:14.753 --> 34:17.523
Let's say Bruce Willis
is eating dinner."

34:17.556 --> 34:19.658
Let's say, for example, like,
Bruce Willis is eating dinner.

34:19.691 --> 34:21.693
"And he drops some
spaghetti on his pants."

34:21.727 --> 34:23.662
And he drops spaghetti sauce
on the pants.
Right.

34:23.695 --> 34:25.197
You know what I mean?

34:25.231 --> 34:27.533
Bruce Willis would bring the
pants in to Esten Cleaners...

34:27.566 --> 34:30.169
"And I would put my lips
on the spaghetti stain

34:30.202 --> 34:32.204
and suck till
the stain came out."

34:32.238 --> 34:34.740
I would then put my lips
on the spaghetti stain...

34:36.074 --> 34:38.710
...and I would suck the stain
out of the pants.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.979
You stain it, I suck it.

34:41.012 --> 34:42.013
Yeah.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.951
"I was pitching them
a new slogan."

34:45.984 --> 34:47.419
I was pitching them
a new slogan.

34:47.453 --> 34:50.456
"Esten Cleaners --
We're up for the challenge."

34:50.489 --> 34:52.724
Esten Cleaners --
We're up for the challenge.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.993
"'Cause James goes
down on stains."

34:55.026 --> 34:56.995
'Cause...

34:58.897 --> 35:01.267
'Cause James
goes down on stains.

35:03.068 --> 35:04.403
You know?

35:04.436 --> 35:06.872
Joe: "I did a whole baseball
team in under 30 minutes."

35:06.905 --> 35:08.240
I...

35:08.274 --> 35:09.775
I-I sucked the stains
off a whole baseball team

35:09.808 --> 35:11.777
in under a half hour.

35:13.579 --> 35:14.980
Other -- Other cleaners
are doing it now,

35:15.013 --> 35:16.047
but it's
my specialty.

35:16.081 --> 35:17.349
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah.

35:17.383 --> 35:19.418
"They actually asked me
to stop doing it, but, uh..."

35:21.687 --> 35:24.690
They actually asked me
to stop doing it...

35:24.723 --> 35:26.091
...but I still do it.

35:27.593 --> 35:30.061
So, um, do you want to
shake the hand of a hero?

35:30.095 --> 35:31.663
I'm kind of a hero.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.465
Oh, you're eating
right now, okay.

35:33.499 --> 35:34.700
You have a great lunch,
then, okay?

35:34.733 --> 35:35.834
Okay. Y-You do, too.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.037
**

35:39.070 --> 35:41.072
'Sup, bud.
Is that yours?

35:41.106 --> 35:43.409
Oh, well, I got -- you know,
I had a good day today.

35:43.442 --> 35:44.676
I got this award here.

35:45.711 --> 35:46.845
What's your award, Joe?

35:46.878 --> 35:49.548
I got...

35:49.581 --> 35:52.651
The American Helicopter Awards,
Comeback Pilot of the Year.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.019
Murr:
Comeback.

35:56.021 --> 35:58.123
"I had
a rough 11-year patch."

35:58.156 --> 35:59.858
It was like a rough
11-year patch

35:59.891 --> 36:02.060
where just I forgot to do
this thing with the seat belts,

36:02.093 --> 36:03.229
'cause it was complicated.

36:03.262 --> 36:04.930
Two people share
a seat belt, right?

36:04.963 --> 36:06.164
I only would do
one half of it,

36:06.198 --> 36:08.099
and then when I would
take off and bank...
Yeah.

36:08.133 --> 36:09.668
...somebody would
just slide right out.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.871
"Well,
once I dumped a kid."

36:12.904 --> 36:14.806
Well, once
I dumped a kid, but...

36:14.840 --> 36:16.007
...but I was over
a bouncy house,

36:16.041 --> 36:17.276
so it all just panned out.

36:17.309 --> 36:18.577
It looked like --
It was like an extreme thing.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.546
It was, like,
everybody had a blast, so...
Wow.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.583
I-I was always
into it growing up.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.553
I always wanted to do maybe
either jet or helicopter,

36:27.586 --> 36:29.187
but a crash
in a helicopter is just --

36:29.221 --> 36:31.457
sometimes if you land too hard
and just the legs break.
Yeah, yeah.

36:31.490 --> 36:32.724
I'm talking
about people's legs.

36:34.226 --> 36:36.027
So, I don't know. You want
to shake the hand of a hero?

36:36.061 --> 36:36.995
Or -- Yeah.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.697
-Oh!
-Ah!

36:38.730 --> 36:40.499
Appreciate it, man.
You have a good day.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.601
I got to get up there.
I got to get the chopper.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.305
**

36:46.338 --> 36:47.706
Hi. How you doing?

36:47.739 --> 36:48.974
Yes, Q, do it.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.141
What's your name?
Yeah, Lloyd.

36:50.175 --> 36:51.343
It's a good day for me,
Lloyd.

36:51.377 --> 36:52.478
I got an award today.

36:53.612 --> 36:54.846
Oh, man, it's great.

36:54.880 --> 36:55.981
Q's gonna love this one.

36:56.014 --> 36:59.050
It's, uh...
Oh, yep. There you go.

36:59.084 --> 37:01.052
It's a Misogyny Challenge.
I came in first place.

37:03.289 --> 37:04.456
Look, see,
don't get the wrong thing.

37:04.490 --> 37:06.224
I love women.
I have a blog, actually.

37:06.258 --> 37:08.527
Brother -- Brother --
Brother of the Sisterhood.
Oh, wow.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.529
-It's a feminist blog.
-Wow.

37:11.963 --> 37:16.067
The key to misogyny, I've found,
is to just be yourself.

37:16.101 --> 37:18.604
"But I really have my mom
to thank. She knew her place."

37:18.637 --> 37:20.972
But I had my mom to thank,
'cause she knew her place,

37:21.006 --> 37:22.173
so she gave me a good,
uh...

37:23.108 --> 37:24.510
"The key is the negging."

37:24.543 --> 37:25.911
Well, the key is to --
negging.

37:25.944 --> 37:26.945
"You see that girl
over there?"

37:26.978 --> 37:28.414
See that girl
over there?

37:28.447 --> 37:30.081
"I would say,
'You know, your smile's nice,

37:30.115 --> 37:32.017
but you have a little bit
of a resting bitch face.'"

37:32.050 --> 37:35.554
Oh, oho!

37:35.587 --> 37:37.222
To her,
I would be, like,

37:37.255 --> 37:38.657
"You know what?
Your smile's nice.

37:38.690 --> 37:39.958
A little bit
of a resting bitch face."

37:41.327 --> 37:43.395
And then, that makes
her feel undervalued...
Mm-hmm.

37:43.429 --> 37:44.996
And then,
that's when the --

37:45.030 --> 37:46.898
the plaques start
rolling in, you know?

37:46.932 --> 37:48.033
Joe: Okay, well,
now it gets interesting.

37:48.066 --> 37:50.268
-Mm-hmm.

37:52.137 --> 37:53.605
That's me.
I just got this today.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.106
"I was honored
to receive this

37:55.140 --> 37:56.274
from the broads
in my office."

37:56.308 --> 37:59.044
All the broads in my office
gave it to me.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.512
Yeah.

38:00.546 --> 38:02.481
I mean, they weren't gonna give
me the cooking award, right?

38:04.983 --> 38:06.251
You want to shake
the hand of a hero?

38:08.754 --> 38:09.788
I'm gonna go to
the local strip club,

38:09.821 --> 38:10.856
see what's going on there.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.760
Sal: So, there you go.
That's the totals.

38:14.793 --> 38:18.163
Both Murr and Q
will be punished.

38:18.196 --> 38:21.567
Only one of them will have
a special prized possession

38:21.600 --> 38:23.101
destroyed by the tank.

38:23.134 --> 38:26.372
The other surprise punishment
happens after this break.

38:26.405 --> 38:27.973
Yeah!

38:28.006 --> 38:31.076
**

38:35.146 --> 38:36.748
That's right!

38:36.782 --> 38:40.185
Welcome back, everyone,
to our huge season finale.

38:40.218 --> 38:42.187
Both Q and Murr
lost today.

38:42.220 --> 38:45.056
The M18 Hellcat tank
is standing by

38:45.090 --> 38:47.559
to destroy one
of their prized possessions.

38:47.593 --> 38:49.227
And Sal and I thought
it would be best

38:49.260 --> 38:51.196
for that someone to be Q.

38:51.229 --> 38:53.532
Q.
-That's right.

38:53.565 --> 38:57.102
Q is gonna have
a prized possession blown away.

38:57.135 --> 38:59.505
That's right. Murr, you've been
spared by the Hellcat.

38:59.538 --> 39:00.606
-That's right.
-Yes. Thank God.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.073
-There you go.
-I, uh...

39:02.107 --> 39:05.076
But trust us -- Murr did not
get off easy at all.
No.

39:05.110 --> 39:07.679
Let's take a look
at what we did to him.

39:09.114 --> 39:11.082
Murr is one of our losers,
so for his punishment,

39:11.116 --> 39:12.250
he's going for a ride.

39:13.552 --> 39:14.953
Come on.
-Yeah, that's right.

39:14.986 --> 39:16.522
You're about to
"Top Gun" it.
Ohh.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.625
We're putting you in a jet
with a fighter pilot,

39:19.658 --> 39:20.992
and you're gonna do
some flying, buddy.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.028
Wait. D-Doesn't
the copilot die in "Top Gun"?

39:23.061 --> 39:24.496
-Ah, don't worry about that.

39:24.530 --> 39:26.031
-Listen.
-He does! He does!

39:26.064 --> 39:28.166
What are you gonna do?
You got your loop-de-loops.
Yeah.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.334
You got your dives.
Dives.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.036
You got
your barrel rolls.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.271
What is this gonna be like
at Mach 2?

39:33.304 --> 39:35.373
That is actually the most
important thing on that plane,

39:35.407 --> 39:37.342
so I'm gonna need you
to put a helmet on.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.844
This has been at
Mach 2 for months.

39:43.314 --> 39:45.617
Well, this is --
this is what we're doing?

39:45.651 --> 39:47.218
-Yeah, it's great.

39:47.252 --> 39:48.520
What am I looking at here?

39:50.522 --> 39:52.123
Bard, I just want to point out
something else to him.

39:52.157 --> 39:54.526
Just take a look right here.
Right here on the plane.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.561
Yeah, it's got
ejector seats.

39:55.594 --> 39:58.129
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no!

39:58.163 --> 40:00.365
No, no, no, no, no. We're
staying in the plane, okay?

40:00.398 --> 40:01.199
Uh, more than likely,
yeah.

40:02.434 --> 40:03.702
**

40:03.735 --> 40:05.236
Temperature 242.17.

40:05.270 --> 40:07.673
Altimeter 3-0-0-0.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.408
1-0. Sky clear.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.844
Ohh, God.

40:12.878 --> 40:15.346
Fire it up!
Fire it up!

40:15.380 --> 40:17.282
**

40:17.315 --> 40:19.918
All: Murr! Suck it!

40:19.951 --> 40:21.286
Holy .

40:22.420 --> 40:24.189
This is crazy.
This is crazy.

40:24.222 --> 40:26.758
Oh, my God.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.159
They told you
I'm afraid of heights, right?

40:28.193 --> 40:29.461
-Yeah, I heard that.
-Great.

40:29.495 --> 40:31.396
Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go!

40:31.429 --> 40:32.564
Oh, my God.

40:32.598 --> 40:34.365
-Bye, Murr.
-Bye, Murr.

40:34.399 --> 40:36.034
**

40:36.067 --> 40:38.670
Wow.

40:38.704 --> 40:41.740
-Safe flight, pal!
yourself!

40:45.677 --> 40:47.713
How you doing
back there, buddy?

40:47.746 --> 40:48.880
I'm all right.

40:48.914 --> 40:50.181
This feels like
a regular plane ride now.

40:50.215 --> 40:52.584
-I'm okay.
-All right, good.

40:52.618 --> 40:55.153
Ooh. This is a steeper --
steeper turn than --

40:55.186 --> 40:56.622
than a regular plane.

40:56.655 --> 40:58.524
All right,
what's our vector, Victor?

40:58.557 --> 40:59.558
Roger, Roger.

41:00.926 --> 41:02.360
All right, Murr.
Get ready.

41:02.393 --> 41:04.329
Get ready for what?

41:04.362 --> 41:06.498
Holy -- Oh, my God!

41:06.532 --> 41:08.133
Holy !

41:09.200 --> 41:10.468
Holy !

41:10.502 --> 41:12.538
Planes aren't supposed
to go upside down! Holy...

41:12.571 --> 41:13.939
We should mention --
It's worth mentioning --

41:13.972 --> 41:16.675
-Murray has baby balls.
-Tiny balls.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.243
You want to
try that again?

41:18.276 --> 41:19.811
No, I don't want to try
any of this again.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.713
-Yeah, you do.
-No, my God!

41:21.747 --> 41:25.483
Oh, my God!

41:26.818 --> 41:28.887
I don't want
to try anything!

41:28.920 --> 41:29.921
Oh, my God.

41:29.955 --> 41:32.490
I'm not gonna fly
out of this stuff?

41:34.526 --> 41:36.127
Yeah, this is good.
You're fine.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.800
What is an inverted flight?
What does that mean?

41:41.833 --> 41:43.569
Oh, my God!

41:43.602 --> 41:46.337
Oh, my God!
Aah! Oh, my God!

41:46.371 --> 41:47.706
Ah! Ahh!

41:47.739 --> 41:49.174
My feet are in the sky!

41:53.344 --> 41:54.846
The best is
when it cuts out.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.948
My feet were just
off the ground!

41:56.982 --> 41:58.884
Sal: How are
those baby balls?

42:04.089 --> 42:05.657
Holy !

42:09.761 --> 42:11.763
Oh, my God!

42:14.866 --> 42:18.003
Oh, my God!

42:18.036 --> 42:19.437
Man: That's good stuff
right there.

42:19.470 --> 42:21.773
Ah, you're doing good.

42:21.807 --> 42:24.042
-Oh, that doesn't sound good.
-His balls are in his throat.

42:24.075 --> 42:25.677
His balls
are out of his throat now,

42:25.711 --> 42:28.246
and they're all over
that cockpit.

42:28.279 --> 42:32.417
This is Command, checking in
with pilot Murrvick, over.

42:32.450 --> 42:35.220
Yeah, he went upside down,
did barrels rolls.

42:35.253 --> 42:38.123
I almost  myself,
and I guess I'm throwing up.

42:38.156 --> 42:39.825
All right. It goes
against my judgment,

42:39.858 --> 42:41.092
but let's bring him
on home.

42:41.126 --> 42:42.193
Let's bring him on home.

42:42.227 --> 42:44.095
No , bring me home.

42:44.129 --> 42:45.130
Yeah, we'll
bring you home, buddy.

42:45.163 --> 42:47.132
-The pilot needs directions.
-Oh.

42:47.165 --> 42:49.000
**

42:49.034 --> 42:50.636
Hey, pilot, it's up
your ass and to the left.

42:52.203 --> 42:54.640
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

42:54.673 --> 42:56.341
Aah! Oh, my God!

42:56.374 --> 42:59.377
-Yeah.
-That was absolutely brutal.

42:59.410 --> 43:02.280
The wig stayed on.
The wig stayed on.
The wig stayed on.

43:02.313 --> 43:03.949
I don't know if I would
have done any better than you,

43:03.982 --> 43:05.751
I promise you,
so you're a brave man.

43:05.784 --> 43:08.453
We'll be right back with
Q's punishment with the tank!

43:08.486 --> 43:09.454
Yay!

43:11.657 --> 43:13.324
Ba-boom!

43:13.358 --> 43:15.326
**

43:18.229 --> 43:20.265
-All right, here we go!
-Here we go!

43:20.298 --> 43:22.067
-Thank you!
-This is it.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.935
Welcome back, everyone.

43:23.969 --> 43:26.672
Now, who's ready
for Q's punishment?

43:26.705 --> 43:28.206
Yeah!

43:32.510 --> 43:35.080
Our tank, the M18 Hellcat,

43:35.113 --> 43:38.884
is gonna destroy
one of Q's prized possessions.

43:38.917 --> 43:41.319
Let's take a look
at what it is, buddy.

43:41.352 --> 43:43.221
**

43:43.254 --> 43:45.924
-Oh!
-Yes.

43:45.957 --> 43:48.559
-Yes. Yes.
-Oh, my God.

43:48.593 --> 43:50.295
That's his real Jeep!

43:50.328 --> 43:53.899
First order of business,
Q's gonna need a ride home.
Yeah.

43:53.932 --> 43:55.400
That, uh...

43:55.433 --> 43:57.202
That's the first
new car I ever owned,

43:57.235 --> 43:58.536
and I love the Jeep
and, uh...

43:58.569 --> 43:59.838
I'd rather it be
Murray up there.

43:59.871 --> 44:02.874
-Like, I feel like...
-Come on. Come on!

44:02.908 --> 44:04.710
I feel like that's
my friend up there.

44:04.743 --> 44:05.911
-Yeah.

44:05.944 --> 44:07.746
-Not for long.
-Yeah. That's right.

44:07.779 --> 44:09.547
All right, well, Q,
the good news is, buddy,

44:09.580 --> 44:11.082
you have one chance
to save your beloved Jeep.

44:11.116 --> 44:12.684
Mm-hmm. He could save it.

44:12.718 --> 44:17.055
The tank -- The tank is
not aimed at it...yet.

44:17.088 --> 44:18.724
We'll ask you
a bunch of questions,

44:18.757 --> 44:19.791
and with every wrong answer,

44:19.825 --> 44:23.128
the turret will take
one step closer

44:23.161 --> 44:24.562
-to get it in the cross hairs...
-That's it.

44:24.595 --> 44:26.631
...and that is
when we will fire.

44:26.664 --> 44:28.800
Do you have any idea
how much a Wrangler costs?

44:28.834 --> 44:30.635
That's good money
you're blowing up up there.

44:30.668 --> 44:31.803
Oh, it's not our money.

44:32.838 --> 44:34.539
It's not our money.
No, no, no.

44:34.572 --> 44:37.442
Without further ado,
are you guys ready to play...

44:37.475 --> 44:39.878
All: "Blow Up That Jeep"?

44:41.446 --> 44:42.881
Here we go.
All right.

44:42.914 --> 44:46.284
Okay, Murr's gonna start you off
with an easy math question.

44:46.317 --> 44:47.552
All right, this is
a simple one, Q.

44:47.585 --> 44:48.854
All right, I'm ready.

44:48.887 --> 44:52.123
So, the Staten Island Ferry
leaves Chicago at 5:40 p.m.

44:52.157 --> 44:54.793
at a speed of 16 knots.

44:54.826 --> 44:57.628
At that speed and assuming
wind is not an issue,

44:57.662 --> 45:01.767
how long for the ferry
to travel 128 knots?

45:01.800 --> 45:04.635
Why are you even trying
to figure this out?

45:04.669 --> 45:06.171
-The question --
-Because my Jeep's up there!

45:08.006 --> 45:09.775
Well, what's a --
How many knots?

45:09.808 --> 45:12.610
128 knots --
it travels at 16 knots.

45:12.643 --> 45:13.912
You're "knots"
gonna get this one.

45:13.945 --> 45:15.747
But in knots...

45:15.781 --> 45:16.782
All right, uh, eight.

45:16.815 --> 45:18.149
-Yeah.

45:18.183 --> 45:21.186
No, the Staten Island Ferry
doesn't leave from Chicago!

45:21.219 --> 45:23.889
-That's right.
-It leaves from Staten Island!

45:23.922 --> 45:27.192
It's a trick question.
Move the turret!

45:27.225 --> 45:28.860
Sal: Move the turret
one notch.

45:30.862 --> 45:32.630
Oh! There it goes.

45:32.663 --> 45:34.465
All right, I'm up.

45:34.499 --> 45:36.067
You ready to try
to save it again?

45:36.101 --> 45:37.635
-Yeah, I'm ready.
-Question number two.

45:37.668 --> 45:39.037
Oh. Oh...

45:39.070 --> 45:42.507
If my life was made
into a movie,

45:42.540 --> 45:44.810
what would the tag line be?

45:44.843 --> 45:47.245
"The nose knows --
the Joe Gatto story."

45:47.278 --> 45:51.582
Oh.
-That was so close.

45:51.616 --> 45:53.018
"Too fat, too furious."
Sorry.

45:54.452 --> 45:56.321
Sorry, that's wrong.
Let's move the turret.

45:56.354 --> 45:57.655
Oh, no.

45:57.688 --> 45:58.957
-Oh, my God.
-Here it goes!

45:58.990 --> 46:01.426
I-I want to stress that
I just filled up the tank.

46:01.459 --> 46:02.660
Yeah.

46:02.693 --> 46:03.962
So if we blow
this thing up,

46:03.995 --> 46:06.932
I want to know my $35.69
is coming back to me.

46:08.166 --> 46:10.401
Sal: It's two clicks,
so one more question.

46:10.435 --> 46:12.370
If you get this right,
it stays put.

46:12.403 --> 46:14.072
You get it wrong,
it goes right at the Jeep.

46:14.105 --> 46:15.306
Question number three.
All right.

46:15.340 --> 46:17.042
Are you ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.

46:17.075 --> 46:18.810
Q, we're all
rooting for you.

46:18.844 --> 46:21.546
Okay, we all met as freshmen,
freshman year

46:21.579 --> 46:24.049
at Monsignor Farrell High School
on Staten Island,

46:24.082 --> 46:25.583
-where we are from.
-Yes.

46:25.616 --> 46:28.653
What is the street address
of our school?

46:28.686 --> 46:30.889
-Oh, ho, ho. We --
-Oh!

46:30.922 --> 46:32.790
-No. Come on. Oh!
-Oh!

46:32.824 --> 46:34.392
2900 Amboy Road...
Oh!

46:34.425 --> 46:37.829
...Staten Island,
New York, 10306!

46:37.863 --> 46:39.664
That's right.
You knew it was 2900?

46:39.697 --> 46:41.666
That's it. We were --

46:41.699 --> 46:43.234
I-I li-- I live
right near the school.

46:43.268 --> 46:45.403
Why wouldn't I know that?
Are you kidding me?

46:45.436 --> 46:48.173
That is --
It's 2900 Amboy Road.
That's it. 2900.

46:48.206 --> 46:49.941
We were not banking
on you knowing the number.
Yeah!

46:49.975 --> 46:51.242
-I'm sorry.
-We're not banking...

46:51.276 --> 46:52.978
I'm sorry.
This, uh -- This just in.

46:53.011 --> 46:54.779
You -- Oh, you actually had
the wrong card set.

46:54.812 --> 46:56.481
-Oh, oh, there's another card.
-You got the wrong card.

46:56.514 --> 46:58.783
-Oh, okay.
-Another card.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.351
-Ah, wrong question.
-That was the wrong question.

47:00.385 --> 47:01.619
This was rigged.

47:02.787 --> 47:04.255
I'm thinking of a number...

47:06.691 --> 47:09.760
...from 1 to 2.

47:09.794 --> 47:11.662
What number
am I thinking of?

47:11.696 --> 47:12.830
1.

47:12.864 --> 47:14.699
Absolutely not.

47:14.732 --> 47:16.701
Let's move the turret!
Wait.

47:16.734 --> 47:17.768
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
-Let's go.

47:17.802 --> 47:19.404
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
-Let's go.

47:19.437 --> 47:21.139
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Oh, here it goes!

47:21.172 --> 47:22.540
-Oh!
Okay.

47:22.573 --> 47:23.674
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

47:23.708 --> 47:25.110
-Wait!
Oh, my God.

47:25.143 --> 47:26.644
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait, wait!

47:26.677 --> 47:28.779
Did you get the hula girl off --
off the dashboard?

47:28.813 --> 47:30.115
Did you get the hula girl
off the dashboard?

47:30.148 --> 47:32.217
The hula girl is on the
dashboard, but it's stuck there.

47:32.250 --> 47:33.684
It's stuck there.
That --

47:33.718 --> 47:35.586
No, you got to --
You take the hula girl off.

47:35.620 --> 47:37.956
Joe: No, we tried.
She didn't want to go.

47:37.989 --> 47:40.258
You go down with the ship.
Everybody knows that.

47:40.291 --> 47:43.628
We are sorry, buddy, but the
Jeep is right in the bull's-eye.

47:43.661 --> 47:45.997
Say goodbye to your ride.

47:46.031 --> 47:48.133
Oh, my God!
I see the hula girl in it!

47:48.166 --> 47:50.568
-I see her from here!
-Guys, this is it.

47:50.601 --> 47:52.570
-Say "aloha."
-This is it.

47:52.603 --> 47:55.706
This is the moment, Q --
say goodbye to your Jeep,

47:55.740 --> 47:59.077
and say hello
to our little friend in...

47:59.110 --> 48:01.346
All: 3...

48:01.379 --> 48:03.014
2...

48:03.048 --> 48:04.515
1...

48:04.549 --> 48:05.516
Fire!

48:05.550 --> 48:08.019
-Oh!
-Aah!

48:08.053 --> 48:09.520
Murr: Oh, my God!

48:09.554 --> 48:12.190
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

48:12.223 --> 48:14.692
Wait, hey, it still
looks drivable to me.

48:16.127 --> 48:19.630
-I think the hula girl's okay.
-It does sort of...

48:19.664 --> 48:21.432
-Ah!
-Oh, ha!

48:21.466 --> 48:24.835
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

48:24.869 --> 48:27.805
-And there you have it.
-Oh, my God.

48:27.838 --> 48:29.975
-And there you have it.

48:30.008 --> 48:32.210
-Ohh!
-Ohh, my God!

48:32.243 --> 48:35.880
Joe: Who's got s'mores?
Who's got s'mores?

48:35.913 --> 48:40.385
Oh, that is not drivable.
There's no fixing that.

48:40.418 --> 48:41.486
That's all

48:41.519 --> 48:44.089
for "Impractical Jokers
Presents G.I. Jokers."

48:44.122 --> 48:46.391
Thanks again to the incredible
service men and women

48:46.424 --> 48:47.758
who joined us here tonight.

48:47.792 --> 48:49.194
This is the end
of season 6.

48:49.227 --> 48:50.261
Thank you so much,
everybody, for watching.

48:50.295 --> 48:52.030
Thank you guys so much
for watching.

48:52.063 --> 48:54.932
Season 7 --
We'll be back in 2018,

48:54.966 --> 48:58.136
and stick around for an
"Impractical Jokers After Party"

48:58.169 --> 48:59.937
starting right now!

48:59.971 --> 49:01.172
Yeah!

49:01.206 --> 49:02.473
Thank you, guys.

49:02.507 --> 49:04.742
And, how about a send
No more the wig!

49:06.611 --> 49:08.879
It's done! Done!
