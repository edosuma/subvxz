00:22.857 --> 00:24.391
NAPOLEON: I've been
working out.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.060
You can tell, right?

00:26.127 --> 00:28.562
Take a long look!
I'm a veritable feast
for the eye.

00:28.629 --> 00:29.930
Been watching what I eat, too.

00:29.997 --> 00:34.047
What about from this angle?

00:35.602 --> 00:37.270
Okay, enough. Give me that.

00:37.337 --> 00:38.873
I can't let you do this.

00:38.939 --> 00:42.710
This cheesy bit
of cheddar goodness
is a ticking time bomb,

00:42.776 --> 00:45.112
packed with delicious
saturated fats

00:45.179 --> 00:47.548
and love handle
producing calories.

00:47.614 --> 00:50.417
Don't be ashamed.
A little self-control,

00:50.484 --> 00:54.187
you too can have this body.

00:54.254 --> 00:57.624
Spot!

00:57.691 --> 01:01.162
Dispose of this immediately!

01:01.229 --> 01:06.229
Let me go,
you lousy scrap of tin!

01:12.506 --> 01:14.006
(SNIFFING)

01:27.755 --> 01:32.255
Look, kitty boy wants to play.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.572
Come back anytime.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.386
I deserve a little
treat, you know.

01:58.453 --> 02:01.755
Which reminds me, we really
need more snacks around
the habit trail.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.925
Like a soft serve machine!
(CHUCKLES)

02:03.992 --> 02:07.228
Rumor has it, rats on
the outside, they eat
from trash cans.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.929
-(GROANS)
-Disgusting, right?

02:08.996 --> 02:12.332
I'd sooner kiss Hamster
that eat out of the trash!

02:12.399 --> 02:13.867
Relax!

02:13.934 --> 02:14.969
I was making a point.

02:15.035 --> 02:18.072
Hello, boys. It's just me.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.407
Well, me and Mr. Wilson.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.708
Say, hello, Wilson.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.777
DR. BIGBY: Hi, Jerry.
Hi, Napoleon.

02:23.844 --> 02:28.782
Hi, antisocial,
overachieving Hamster.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.751
Want to get
the string, Wilson?

02:30.818 --> 02:32.285
Get the string, boy.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.387
Come on. You can do it.

02:34.454 --> 02:36.523
Okay, forget the string.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.525
But what about the surprise?

02:38.592 --> 02:40.794
Whose got a surprise
for their boy?

02:40.861 --> 02:43.063
Daddy does.
That's right.

02:43.130 --> 02:45.532
I made it just
for you, Wilson.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.368
This cell rejuvenator chamber

02:47.435 --> 02:50.070
is gonna make you
get that string again.

02:50.137 --> 02:54.474
And you'll be
that itty bitty kitty
we used to know.

02:54.541 --> 02:57.111
-(DINGS)
-I hope.

02:57.178 --> 03:00.778
See you soon, sweetkins.

03:19.700 --> 03:24.337
(WHIRRING)

03:24.404 --> 03:25.754
(BANGING)

03:45.293 --> 03:50.293
Think kitty boy's ever
gonna stop trying
to get in here?

04:05.813 --> 04:08.513
-Phew!
-(CRASHING)

04:11.718 --> 04:13.220
Hardly matters I suppose.

04:13.287 --> 04:16.523
Seeing how we're
the superior species and all.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.840
(CLEARS THROAT)

04:21.695 --> 04:25.595
-(TICKING)
-(DEVICE DINGS)

04:31.404 --> 04:32.754
(BEEPING)

04:39.847 --> 04:42.916
Look at the baby!
Hi, baby!

04:42.983 --> 04:46.920
(CHUCKLES) I just
wanna squeeze...

04:46.987 --> 04:50.924
Aw, have you ever seen
anything so adorable?

04:50.991 --> 04:55.991
Except for me as
a baby, of course.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.279
Please! Please! Please!

05:12.346 --> 05:17.346
Please, be my little kitten.
Please! Please! Please!

05:17.918 --> 05:21.422
Yes!
My itty witty kitty is back!

05:21.489 --> 05:26.489
You're not quite as cute
as I rember but you're back!

05:26.793 --> 05:28.028
Let's go home.

05:28.095 --> 05:33.095
Now we can do everything
we used to.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.173
There you are, little baby.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.775
You know for being
a mouser, he's a real cutie.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.577
(ROARING)

05:43.643 --> 05:47.843
Uh-oh, that's not very cute.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.354
(SCREECHING)

05:54.421 --> 05:55.921
(GROWLING)

06:02.329 --> 06:04.631
What's the matter,
itty witty kitty?

06:04.698 --> 06:08.735
Too tubby to tube?

06:08.802 --> 06:11.502
Guess that's a no.

06:20.314 --> 06:23.914
Too bad cats hate water.

06:27.555 --> 06:32.205
But they sure
like drinking it.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.499
Whose boy are you, Wilson?

06:39.566 --> 06:40.635
Whose boy are you?

06:40.702 --> 06:44.571
Oh, you're daddy's boy.
That's right!

06:44.638 --> 06:45.873
Get the string, Wilson.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.176
Get the string.

06:49.243 --> 06:52.346
Oh, look whose back
like old times!

06:52.413 --> 06:56.013
Now get the tingle ball!

07:03.957 --> 07:05.457
(CRASHING)

07:14.301 --> 07:16.637
Good boy! Wasn't that fun?

07:16.704 --> 07:19.874
Okay, time to take our
holiday card photo.

07:19.941 --> 07:24.941
Now that you're feeling
better you can wear
the costume.

07:27.481 --> 07:30.784
-(BEEPING)
-Say cheese!

07:30.851 --> 07:34.622
(CAMERA CLICKS)

07:34.689 --> 07:39.689
Now, let's do our
Valentine's day card.

07:57.311 --> 08:00.011
(TEETH CHATTERING)

08:05.752 --> 08:06.887
Thanks, pal.

08:06.954 --> 08:10.554
I thought I was a goner.

08:32.146 --> 08:34.715
Knock, knock!

08:34.782 --> 08:37.651
Come on, Wilson.
You know how we play this.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.253
Knock, knock!

08:39.320 --> 08:41.288
You're supposed to say,
"Meow, meow."

08:41.355 --> 08:46.355
We've done this
a thousand times, Wilson.

08:46.794 --> 08:51.794
(SIGHS) This isn't the itty
witty kitty I know.

08:55.836 --> 09:00.036
Must be some kind of glitch.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.813
We gotta save Jerry,
I tell you.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.730
Think of something!

09:12.119 --> 09:13.469
I got it!

09:18.125 --> 09:20.375
NAPOLEON: Spot!

09:23.764 --> 09:28.414
Ta-da-da-da!
Rat to the rescue.

09:29.403 --> 09:31.671
I did it! I saved you!
(GRINS)

09:31.738 --> 09:36.076
Whose superior now?

09:36.143 --> 09:38.945
Wilson! Is that you?

09:39.012 --> 09:40.914
Knock, knock!

09:40.981 --> 09:42.549
(MEWING)

09:42.615 --> 09:45.252
Wilson!

09:45.319 --> 09:46.787
Wait a minute.

09:46.854 --> 09:51.091
-If you're Wilson
then who was...
-(PURRING)

09:51.158 --> 09:52.459
Oh, who cares!

09:52.526 --> 09:54.395
I got by kitty back.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.963
Whose daddy's boy?
Whose daddy's boy?

09:57.030 --> 10:00.234
-(SNARLING)
-(GROANING)

10:00.301 --> 10:01.335
(YOWLING)

10:01.402 --> 10:03.737
My head! (GROANS)

10:03.804 --> 10:07.308
Oh, forget it!

10:07.374 --> 10:08.724
(BEEPING)

10:19.286 --> 10:21.255
Wilson, buddy.

10:21.322 --> 10:22.590
You're back.

10:22.657 --> 10:27.607
I'll take old over
crazy any day!

10:38.805 --> 10:40.305
(WHIRRING)

10:48.215 --> 10:50.417
Finally some peace and quiet.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.553
Know what I'm thinking?

10:52.620 --> 10:54.355
Grilled cheese sandwiches!

10:54.421 --> 10:56.691
Now we are talking!
(CHUCKLES)

10:56.757 --> 10:59.626
Until we get that
soft serve ice cream
machine, of course!
