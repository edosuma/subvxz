Welcome to Luigi's!

13:12.167 --> 13:15.390
The Super Monsters were so excited
to have a field trip

13:15.473 --> 13:17.130
to their favorite restaurant.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.548
Actually, tonight,

13:18.840 --> 13:20.600
the bambinos wanted this trip

13:20.683 --> 13:22.680
to be all about you!

Surprise!

13:24.763 --> 13:27.998
It's your monster
appreciation night dinner!

13:28.210 --> 13:30.960
To thank you for being
the best teachers ever!

13:31.168 --> 13:32.377
The Super bambinos

13:32.563 --> 13:34.578
asked me to help them do something

13:34.662 --> 13:36.612
super-special for you!

13:36.983 --> 13:39.247
Right this way, please.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.745
-Thanks, Spike.
-Oh, thank you!

Just relax and enjoy your dinner.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.920
We'll take care of everything.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.252
Remember, as the server,

13:55.335 --> 13:58.130
it's your job to write down
the customer's order,

13:58.213 --> 14:00.090
and then serve it when it's ready.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.342
Got it!

14:02.613 --> 14:05.833
-May I take your order?
-Yes, please.

14:06.222 --> 14:08.407
I'll have the veggie calzone,

14:08.640 --> 14:11.943
the salad, and an ice cream
sundae for desert.

14:12.877 --> 14:14.543
Let's see. I think

14:14.710 --> 14:17.502
I'll have the veggie calzone,
the salad,

14:17.733 --> 14:20.258
and an ice cream sundae
for desert.

14:20.458 --> 14:21.675
Two veggie calzones,

two salads, and ice cream
sundaes for desert.

14:24.948 --> 14:25.950

Katya and Lobo, that's you.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.097
[Lobo howls]

14:40.297 --> 14:42.583
Two salads. Frankie,
that's you and me.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.218
And ice cream sundaes
for desert.

14:45.302 --> 14:47.157
-That's Drac and me!
-Yeah!

14:47.240 --> 14:50.182
All right, Super Monsters,
let's make this monster appreciation

14:50.295 --> 14:53.093
night super special
with a super special meal!

14:53.293 --> 14:55.695
Always remember what
Luigi taught you.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.657
The best food is made
with the best ingredients.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.513
And a lot of love!

15:00.900 --> 15:02.160
And in Luigi's kitchen

15:02.360 --> 15:05.247
there is one thing
that's most important of all!

15:05.447 --> 15:06.572
Be safe.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.293
Only grown-ups use the oven.

15:09.493 --> 15:12.452
Okie-dokie, time to make
the calzones.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.925
A calzone is a pizza folded in half.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.000
-Who's ready to try?
-I am!

15:20.837 --> 15:22.347
Let's see, punch it,

15:22.547 --> 15:25.467
spread it, toss it, and spin it.

15:26.968 --> 15:27.978
Oh!

15:28.178 --> 15:30.233
I think a little magic might help!

Stretch and spread without a fuzz,
help me make a pizza crust!

15:43.110 --> 15:44.975
Oops! Sorry.

15:45.175 --> 15:46.663
Now it's time for the filling!

15:46.747 --> 15:49.032
Some sauce, some cheese,
and some veggies.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.542
What else?

15:52.077 --> 15:53.177
Maybe some garlic?

15:53.620 --> 15:54.672
Garlic?

15:54.872 --> 15:58.050
Oh, right. Sorry, Drac. I forgot.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.835
OK, no garlic.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.380
Igor and Esme always say
that veggies are good for you.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.342
So let's make these calzones
really good for them!

16:06.425 --> 16:08.578
They sure are working hard.

lot of love in that dish.

we were so hungry?

salad fixes from home.

Now, a little salad dressing,
and we're ready to go.

a tossed salad!

17:05.083 --> 17:08.043
I hope you like marshmallows
and graham crackers!

17:08.237 --> 17:10.072
They are my secret ingredients.

17:11.502 --> 17:12.585
Tangy!

17:13.125 --> 17:14.710
And... crunchy.

17:15.335 --> 17:18.418
Yet sweet and chewy.

17:19.043 --> 17:22.627
Oh, Frankie. You are a very
creative salad chef.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.753

to get back to work!

super special secret surprise?

That the best food is made
with the best ingredients?

And a lot of love?

Exactly!

And Luigi sees a lot of love
in this food.

20:01.702 --> 20:03.328
You know? There is a saying,

-Yeah!
-Yeah!

doesn't have to be perfect.

know how much we appreciate them.

There's no way
I'd rather have it.

all those healthy veggies.

didn't turn out like we planned.

is perfect.
