WEBVTT

02:13.767 --> 02:14.902
Michiko.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.475
Michiko.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.642
Oh, hey.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.246
What's with the suit?

02:59.880 --> 03:01.482
What is this?

03:01.549 --> 03:04.852
Mom promised we could use
this place for our meeting.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.255
Meeting?

03:10.824 --> 03:14.528
Uh, Dad, my friends
are counting on me.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.797
Please don't make me
go back on my word.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.734
Keep your word.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.737
We're good, guys.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.739
- Come on.
- Honey, come quick.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.276
- Huh?
- He's learning to wave back.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.344
- What?
- Did you wave? You did.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.579
You learned
how to wave, Donny?

03:31.645 --> 03:33.080
Yeah, he started
waving in the car.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.182
Good job.
That's amazing, buddy.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.351
Yeah. Show him.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.922
Should we
take a little nap?

03:41.989 --> 03:43.857
Just a little one?

03:48.296 --> 03:50.631
Good morning, O-to-san.

03:50.698 --> 03:54.302
Good Morning, Miss--
uh, Juliana.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.804
You seem different somehow.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.172
Different? How so?

03:59.307 --> 04:01.108
I don't know.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.976
You seem really well.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.379
Everybody,
this is Nori's dad.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.847
- Hi.
- Hello.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.917
Hey, thanks for letting
us use the place.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.885
We have so much to do.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.921
- Juliana.
- Yeah.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.590
What is this meeting for?

04:16.657 --> 04:18.859
It's one of our
Ban the Bomb meetings.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.866
I'm really glad you're here.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.369
Look, I just need to know
that it's over, George.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.170
I can't just assume
finding you is enough

04:30.237 --> 04:31.772
to stop what I saw
happen in the film.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.206
As simple as that,

04:33.341 --> 04:35.443
just pick up
my direct line to the Castle?

04:35.509 --> 04:38.979
I've got a better chance of
collect calling Grace Kelly.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.783
I sent a message.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.454
We haven't heard back yet.

04:47.488 --> 04:51.525
Word is
he's gone AWOL again.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.028
So...

04:55.095 --> 04:56.897
how was dinner?

04:58.432 --> 05:00.701
You could almost
forget they're Nazis.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.036
It won't work coming
at the Smiths straight on,

05:03.103 --> 05:08.842
so my people want you to take
a more indirect approach.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.711
Oh no, I'm not taking
any approach.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.045
The Smiths
are not why I'm here.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.447
We've been over that.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.182
Let me talk
to your people, okay?

05:15.248 --> 05:16.617
Explain the situation.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.686
Now, see, that's something
a Nazi spy would say.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.020
We've been over that, too.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.456
Your pop saved my life.

05:22.523 --> 05:26.427
Risking it to give you another
chance feels like payback,

05:26.494 --> 05:28.962
but I'm not gonna
ask my people to risk theirs.

05:32.299 --> 05:33.601
I didn't know that--

05:35.068 --> 05:37.638
about you and my father.
How did he save your life?

05:38.406 --> 05:39.873
Nope.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.709
We're not gonna do that.

05:43.411 --> 05:46.414
You've got to go a long way
to earn my trust.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.215
George,
I am not a Nazi.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.718
Well, that's--
that's the thing.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.789
We're gonna need you
to become one.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.127
Helen Smith may not act it,

06:00.193 --> 06:03.764
but she is the queen bee
of the Nazi social scene.

06:03.831 --> 06:07.501
The wives, girlfriends
of top Nazis suck up to her.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.736
So you're going
to suck up to them.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.137
Look, I did
what you asked, okay?

06:10.203 --> 06:11.572
I went there,
and I smiled,

06:11.639 --> 06:13.306
and I pretended
everything was fine,

06:13.441 --> 06:15.042
and all I wanted to do
was scream.

06:15.108 --> 06:18.912
We're looking at this-- you--
as a long-term investment.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.814
You'll never
be really close to the Smiths

06:20.881 --> 06:22.916
unless their friends
accept you.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.753
You think women
like Helen's friends
are going to welcome me?

06:25.819 --> 06:27.588
Once you're in
with the Smiths,

06:27.655 --> 06:30.257
you'll be considered
a curiosity.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.125
Or competition. George,

06:32.192 --> 06:33.894
you don't know the first
thing about women, do you?

06:33.961 --> 06:35.796
Well, that may be true,

06:35.863 --> 06:37.865
but it's the deal
keeping you alive.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.298
Are you sure about this,
Jennifer?

07:11.364 --> 07:13.501
Yes, I'm sure.
Mrs. Pack said.

07:13.501 --> 07:16.637
Well, that means
your ballet finishes

07:16.704 --> 07:17.971
at exactly the same time

07:18.038 --> 07:19.740
Thomas' wrestling
practice starts.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.510
I don't mind
missing piano.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.645
That's very noble
of you, Amy,

07:24.712 --> 07:26.714
but your piano is on
a completely different day.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.650
Don't they understand
how difficult it is

07:29.717 --> 07:31.418
to figure out a schedule
for three kids?

07:31.519 --> 07:33.821
How-- How can I be
two places at once?

07:33.887 --> 07:36.289
Thomas keeps saying
he's a man now.
Why can't he walk?

07:36.356 --> 07:37.658
Don't worry.
We'll work it out.

07:37.725 --> 07:40.794
That is easy to say,
John, but how exactly?

07:45.332 --> 07:47.100
What is it, son?

07:47.167 --> 07:50.538
I, um, I got a letter.

07:51.705 --> 07:52.973
What does it say?

07:53.040 --> 07:54.675
It's from
the Commander's Office.

07:54.742 --> 07:57.410
Ten Hitler Youth members
have been selected

07:57.545 --> 08:00.380
to go on a month-long
expedition,

08:00.447 --> 08:01.882
"to civilize and educate

08:01.949 --> 08:04.217
those unfortunates
living outside the Reich."

08:04.284 --> 08:05.953
I've been chosen to go.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.055
To the Neutral Zone?

08:08.121 --> 08:09.623
To South America.

08:10.724 --> 08:11.992
Well, that's, uh...

08:14.127 --> 08:15.796
that's quite an--

08:17.631 --> 08:19.767
that's quite an honor, son.
Congratulations.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.034
When do you go?

08:21.101 --> 08:22.570
He's not going.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.873
- What?
- Helen--

08:28.576 --> 08:29.943
Thomas, I'm-- I'm sorry.

08:30.010 --> 08:34.414
I am very proud of you,
obviously, but this--

08:34.481 --> 08:37.084
it's out of the question.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.251
Isn't it?

08:38.318 --> 08:40.287
Uh, why, um,

08:40.353 --> 08:42.590
why is it
out of the question?

08:42.656 --> 08:43.791
We'll discuss it later.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.426
There's
nothing to discuss.

08:46.493 --> 08:47.661
I thought you'd be pleased.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.599
I said later.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.051
Whoa.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.693
You need not eat it all.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.428
I wanted you
to have a choice.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.030
In future,
you'll let me know

09:23.096 --> 09:25.766
which dishes
you particularly enjoy.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.501
Uh, thank you, Silvia,

09:28.636 --> 09:30.137
but you don't have to
wait on me like this.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.805
But I want to.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.642
Hmm.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.647
Thank you.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.654
Where's my father?

09:46.654 --> 09:48.689
The Reichsminister
had to leave early,

09:48.756 --> 09:50.658
but he has a car
waiting for you.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.192
He cleared his schedule

09:52.259 --> 09:54.161
to spend the day
showing you Berlin.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.537
You'll need to change.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.374
Was the suit I laid out
for you not to your liking?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.678
Oh. That.

10:13.513 --> 10:15.649
Heusmann's family.

10:15.716 --> 10:19.052
Your parents...
were never married.

10:19.119 --> 10:23.623
After your mother took you,
your father met Margot.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.092
They were very happy,

10:25.158 --> 10:28.261
and they had two handsome
boys: Dieter and Rolf.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.797
I see.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.367
Where are they now?

10:34.434 --> 10:37.237
They were killed in
an Allied bombing raid

10:37.304 --> 10:38.638
outside of Hanover.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.043
Were there others,

10:43.110 --> 10:44.778
or am I the only one
he has left?

10:44.845 --> 10:46.847
This is not something
I can answer.

10:46.914 --> 10:50.050
You should speak with
the Reichsminister.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.090
- Julia.
- Helen. Hi.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.592
I just wanted to say
thank you so much for dinner.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.194
I had such a great time.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.329
Oh, it's sweet of you
to come all the way over.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.831
You could have just called.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.067
Oh, I just wanted
to bring you this.

11:41.468 --> 11:42.770
That's very sweet.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.508
I'm sorry.
I've come at a bad time.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.410
That's just bridge club.

11:50.477 --> 11:53.013
Bridge. I always wanted
to learn how to play.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.882
Maybe you could
teach me some time?

11:56.249 --> 11:58.485
The girls would love
to meet you.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.788
Uh, why don't you come in?

12:00.821 --> 12:03.123
I-- Okay. Thank you.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.000
Girls, this is
Miss Julia Mills.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.803
Uh, Mrs. Alice Adler.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.237
I'm sorry for your loss.

12:17.304 --> 12:21.508
Mrs. Mary Dawson
and Mrs. Lucy Collins.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.810
Hello.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.812
Sorry for interrupting
your game.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.346
Oh, don't be silly.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.016
The girls are just trying
to distract me anyway.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.818
Would you like
some coffee, sweetheart?

12:30.818 --> 12:32.085
- Thank you.
- Okay.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.521
Julia wants
to learn to play.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.990
She's just moved here
from the out West-- Seattle.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.292
They don't have bridge in
the Pacific States anymore?

12:39.359 --> 12:40.593
We play Mahjong.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.496
I suppose those Japs made
you give up everything

12:43.563 --> 12:45.098
when they came marching in.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.700
Between that
and their delusional
sense of superiority.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.002
How did you stomach it?

12:49.069 --> 12:51.571
I don't know.
You just, um...

12:51.638 --> 12:53.506
go on living,
I guess.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.108
If you call that
living.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.009
Mm.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.210
So it turns out

12:57.277 --> 12:58.912
I was right
about Marjory's nanny.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.081
The girl was
genetically a Semite.

13:01.148 --> 13:05.018
Imagine someone like that
having access to children.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.186
With that
and genetic defects,

13:06.253 --> 13:07.888
there should be
compulsory screening.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.022
Hmm.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.424
Gerry used to say that.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.860
Was she reported?

13:12.926 --> 13:14.161
Of course.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.695
I couldn't live with myself

13:15.762 --> 13:18.198
if I hadn't said something.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.867
Your play.

13:20.868 --> 13:21.902
Hmm?

13:21.969 --> 13:23.336
Your play, dear.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.706
Are you all right?

13:26.773 --> 13:29.209
Oh yes.
Of course, I'm fine.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.346
I suppose you must've seen
a lot of that sort of thing.

13:33.413 --> 13:37.250
The Japs are very lax with
their racial laws, so I hear.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.119
- Well--
- I don't blame you

13:39.186 --> 13:40.620
for staying single,
Miss Mills.

13:40.687 --> 13:43.690
Without any proper regulation
for genetic hygiene,

13:43.756 --> 13:46.259
you could very well end up
being married to anyone.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.296
Don't be ridiculous,
Lucy. You'd know.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.730
How could you tell?

13:50.797 --> 13:53.633
Because they have
certain traits.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.168
But how--

13:55.235 --> 13:57.370
Oh! I'm so sorry!

13:57.437 --> 13:58.671
I don't know
how that happened.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.407
Let me get you a cloth,
please.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.242
- I'll do it.
- It's all right.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.356
I wasn't sure you'd come.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.690
It sounded urgent.

14:17.757 --> 14:18.992
What's wrong?

14:19.059 --> 14:20.994
Another fight
with your father?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.165
The way we met--

14:25.232 --> 14:28.268
that was no coincidence,
was it?

14:28.335 --> 14:30.370
My father sent you
to persuade me to stay.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.939
This is why you
called me here?

14:32.005 --> 14:34.107
I just want to know

14:34.174 --> 14:36.509
because I've had enough
people lying to me.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.947
Okay.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.115
Yes, your father asked me
to talk to you.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.850
Is that how you afford
your fancy car

14:43.951 --> 14:45.252
and your nice dresses?

14:45.318 --> 14:47.087
Doing what powerful men
ask you to?

14:47.154 --> 14:48.355
Whatever issues you're
having with your father,

14:48.421 --> 14:51.391
don't blame me.
Go be angry with him.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.360
You don't know
anything about me.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.398
Wait a second. Just wait.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.372
You're right.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.376
Please, can we
just start over?

15:09.442 --> 15:12.312
And be honest
with one another?

15:23.256 --> 15:24.424
Hello.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.259
I'm Nicole.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.494
All right.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.761
I'm Joe.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.397
Nice to meet you.

15:32.732 --> 15:35.302
Now can you please get me
the hell out of here?

15:36.403 --> 15:37.370
Get in.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.410
Josef!

15:43.476 --> 15:44.711
Stop, please!

15:45.878 --> 15:47.280
Josef!

15:51.818 --> 15:53.153
Is it coming out?

15:53.220 --> 15:55.055
It doesn't matter.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.024
It was a donation anyway.

15:57.057 --> 16:00.060
I didn't have much
when I moved here.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.661
Now I feel even worse.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.396
No, don't be silly.
It's fine.

16:05.032 --> 16:08.868
I must say your dress
is very beautiful.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.703
Thank you.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.172
It is, isn't it?

16:12.239 --> 16:14.041
I couldn't believe
how well it fit.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.308
Well,
even I can see that,

16:15.375 --> 16:18.545
and I don't know
anything about fashion.

16:18.611 --> 16:19.946
John might have warned me

16:20.047 --> 16:21.614
you were such a stylish
group of women.

16:22.849 --> 16:25.518
How exactly do you
know the family?

16:25.585 --> 16:28.155
A mutual friend.

16:29.589 --> 16:33.493
John and Helen
have been so kind to me.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.062
He's amazing.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.330
And she just gives
and gives.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.833
Well, it's not coming out.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.802
Why don't you let me
replace it?

16:42.869 --> 16:44.071
No, you don't
have to do that.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.638
But I want to.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.441
Okay.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.382
I love the way
the light falls on the leaves.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.618
It reminds me that whatever
I think is so important,

16:58.685 --> 17:00.253
the trees don't care.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.759
Did your mother ever
speak of the Fatherland?

17:08.761 --> 17:11.098
My mother? Uh, heh.

17:11.164 --> 17:14.767
No, she-- she never
talked about the past.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.536
She said it unhealthy,

17:16.603 --> 17:18.671
that I should focus
on the future.

17:18.738 --> 17:22.109
You don't have to talk
if you don't want to.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.514
Yesterday I found out
I'm a bastard.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.249
You proved that
this morning.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.787
My mother lied to me.

17:34.854 --> 17:38.391
My father
didn't run out on us.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.193
She took me
away from him.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.794
I'm sorry, Joe.

17:48.034 --> 17:50.137
I'm Lebensborn.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.773
Does that spook you?

17:55.275 --> 17:57.310
Why would it?

17:57.377 --> 17:59.446
Welcome to the club.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.186
Wait, wait, wait. Heh.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.655
Wait. Y-You're--

18:12.359 --> 18:14.161
We're not--

18:15.495 --> 18:16.696
No.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.267
Would I have kissed you
like that?

18:22.235 --> 18:23.803
Calm down.

18:23.870 --> 18:27.174
Being Lebensborn isn't
the worst thing in the world.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.810
Really? Finding out you come
from a breeding program?

18:30.877 --> 18:33.713
We didn't have any choice
in how we were born.

18:33.780 --> 18:37.184
That housekeeper Silvia looks
at me like I'm some sort of--

18:37.217 --> 18:38.551
Chosen one?

18:38.618 --> 18:41.854
Our parents' generation
had some strange ideas.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.025
Do I seem special to you?

18:46.092 --> 18:48.361
No, not at all.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.830
You're completely boring.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.632
The only thing special
about me

18:52.699 --> 18:54.467
is that I refuse
to let my father

18:54.534 --> 18:56.035
marry me off to some fossil.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.670
I will decide
what to do with my life

18:57.737 --> 18:59.672
and my future,
thank you very much.

19:02.675 --> 19:03.643
So...

19:04.811 --> 19:06.346
have you had enough?

19:08.381 --> 19:10.283
Not even close.

19:12.051 --> 19:14.721
I'm actually supposed
to be somewhere,

19:14.787 --> 19:16.223
but why don't you come?

19:16.289 --> 19:19.392
It might be just
the thing you need.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.628
What's that?

19:23.330 --> 19:25.765
A different kind of space.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.201
Sir,
we have a priority message

20:02.269 --> 20:03.736
from San Francisco Station.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.505
Our agents believe
they have located

20:05.572 --> 20:07.006
the most recent hideout
of High Castle.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.508
How recent?

20:08.575 --> 20:11.043
It was a barn, torched
within the last 24 hours.

20:11.110 --> 20:15.648
And it appears
that the fire destroyed
a large cache of films.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.250
Hundreds.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.787
And that's very unfortunate.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.055
Our agents are continuing
to search the area.

20:23.122 --> 20:25.292
Can you remind
our Yakuza friends

20:25.358 --> 20:26.959
of the exact conditions
of payment?

20:27.026 --> 20:30.062
- I want High Castle alive.
- Yes, sir.

20:30.129 --> 20:33.032
Erich. How are you?
How's your mother?

20:33.099 --> 20:34.767
We're both very well, Mrs.--

20:36.168 --> 20:38.605
Helen. Thank you.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.440
Uh, it's a pleasure
to see you here.

20:40.507 --> 20:41.708
We had arranged to talk,

20:41.774 --> 20:43.510
but I don't think
we set a time.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.445
Now would be ideal for me,

20:45.512 --> 20:47.847
if it's convenient,
of course.

20:49.181 --> 20:50.417
I'll have
the Standartenführers

20:50.483 --> 20:51.751
await further orders, sir.

20:51.818 --> 20:54.321
No calls, please,
Erich.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.528
John--

21:29.522 --> 21:31.791
This couldn't wait
till I got home?

21:31.858 --> 21:33.760
He's not going, John.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.828
I will not allow it.

21:35.895 --> 21:36.963
I stop breathing

21:37.029 --> 21:38.698
the moment Thomas
walks out that front door,

21:38.765 --> 21:41.368
and I only start again
when he is back home.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.370
You want to let him
go to South America?

21:43.436 --> 21:45.204
- Helen--
- He will be found out,

21:45.271 --> 21:46.373
and you know
what that means.

21:46.373 --> 21:47.540
Okay.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.442
Sit down.

21:49.509 --> 21:50.677
Helen, sit down, please.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.055
We are
going to let him go.

22:04.991 --> 22:10.697
Thomas will fly
to Buenos Aires,
all right?

22:10.763 --> 22:13.733
And from there,
he's going to travel

22:13.800 --> 22:15.835
to meet the others
on his expedition.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.637
But he's not going to
make the rendezvous

22:17.704 --> 22:20.407
because, somewhere in the
foothills of the Andes,

22:20.407 --> 22:22.942
he's going to be
kidnapped by Semites.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.078
You did this.

22:26.145 --> 22:27.680
Now, this is
going to look like,

22:27.747 --> 22:29.449
to the rest of the world,

22:29.516 --> 22:32.552
a terrorist act
on a high-profile target,

22:32.619 --> 22:34.487
but Thomas,
he's going to be okay.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.088
He'll be safe.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.323
In South America?

22:37.424 --> 22:40.326
He could live
for decades, Helen.

22:40.427 --> 22:44.330
This way, he's going
to be comfortable.

22:44.431 --> 22:45.665
He's going to be safe.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.867
No one's going to be
able to reach him.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.669
How can you be sure?

22:49.736 --> 22:51.971
Because I will personally
spearhead the search for him

22:52.038 --> 22:53.239
and for his kidnappers.

22:53.440 --> 22:59.446
Now, you, of course, will
be bereft, as will I,

22:59.446 --> 23:01.481
and publicly
we'll never give up

23:01.548 --> 23:04.216
trying to bring
our son home.

23:04.283 --> 23:06.786
But ultimately, Helen...

23:08.120 --> 23:10.490
we will fail.

23:17.229 --> 23:21.668
Now, if you have
any questions,

23:21.734 --> 23:24.671
you have to ask me now...

23:24.737 --> 23:27.607
because, I'm afraid,
once you've left this room,

23:27.674 --> 23:30.477
we must never
talk about this again.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.690
Will I ever see him again?

23:49.496 --> 23:51.731
Maybe, one day.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.636
When and if it is safe.

23:59.506 --> 24:01.173
It's the only way,
Helen.

24:24.731 --> 24:26.833
Must bring back
memories.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.969
Sorry. Memories?

24:30.036 --> 24:32.271
You're Nori's dad,
right?

24:32.338 --> 24:33.439
Yes.

24:33.540 --> 24:34.807
I'm Jimmy.

24:36.075 --> 24:37.677
Hello.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.311
You must've been there--

24:39.378 --> 24:41.581
in Japan, I mean,
you know--

24:41.648 --> 24:43.950
when they dropped
the Big Ones?

24:44.016 --> 24:45.585
Big Ones?

24:45.652 --> 24:48.087
Hiroshima? Nagasaki?

24:50.289 --> 24:51.991
I've seen photos.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.392
Horrible, isn't it?

24:53.560 --> 24:55.194
What we do
to one another.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.196
Human beings, I mean.

24:59.231 --> 25:00.199
Yes.

25:03.570 --> 25:04.904
Please excuse me.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.639
Yeah, sure.

25:08.741 --> 25:09.842
Yeah, we--

25:09.909 --> 25:11.243
I can take a break from--

25:15.782 --> 25:17.817
- Great.
- We'll see.

25:17.884 --> 25:18.651
Okay.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.252
Hey,
what do you think?

25:20.319 --> 25:21.287
I love that.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.321
- Yeah.
- Great.

25:22.388 --> 25:23.455
Honey, how are you doing?

25:23.590 --> 25:24.791
Oh, yeah,
we're getting there.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.392
- I think these are dry.
- Okay.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.260
That one, too.
You can hang those up.

25:28.327 --> 25:30.630
Getting there.
Here, you, uh...

25:30.697 --> 25:34.601
Does everyone have
everything they need?

25:34.634 --> 25:36.402
Hey, Joey, do you
want to grab these?

26:14.774 --> 26:16.108
What's going on?

26:17.644 --> 26:18.945
Hey, honey,
we're running low

26:19.011 --> 26:20.880
on poster board
and some staples.

26:20.947 --> 26:22.214
You want to maybe
go down to the shop

26:22.281 --> 26:24.350
with your dad
and pick some up?

26:24.416 --> 26:25.652
Please?

26:27.086 --> 26:29.856
You up for running
an errand, Dad?

26:29.922 --> 26:31.057
Hmm.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.837
These are from Frankfurt.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.673
A French designer,
of course.

26:46.739 --> 26:48.040
Say what you will
about them,

26:48.107 --> 26:50.276
but they do know how to cut
for the female form.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.479
I love the palette
this year.

26:53.680 --> 26:54.814
It's so chic,
don't you think?

26:54.881 --> 26:56.248
Yeah, it's lovely.

26:58.484 --> 27:01.153
Oh, this is
the special collection.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.189
Ordinarily, you wouldn't
have access to these,

27:03.255 --> 27:04.691
but since you're with me--

27:06.525 --> 27:07.994
I read that the Reich
issues

27:08.060 --> 27:10.196
a standard clothing
allowance to everyone.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.031
Well, yes,

27:12.098 --> 27:15.434
but not everyone has to
attend formal functions.

27:15.501 --> 27:18.871
My husband Henry oversees
the television networks here.

27:18.938 --> 27:21.774
He reports directly
to Reichsminister Goebbels.

27:23.776 --> 27:26.612
I'm sorry. I should probably
know what that means.

27:26.713 --> 27:29.381
Henry helps...

27:29.448 --> 27:30.917
decide what people think--

27:30.983 --> 27:33.720
or at least what makes it
onto the news.

27:33.720 --> 27:36.422
To hear him describe it,
it's the same thing.

27:39.558 --> 27:40.993
Let's try her in the black.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.595
It'll show off
that darling waist.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.732
And I'll try
the vine and floral.

27:48.901 --> 27:51.270
So how long have you
and Henry been married?

27:51.337 --> 27:53.172
Five happy years.

27:53.239 --> 27:54.974
Oh, don't worry.

27:55.041 --> 27:57.276
With your looks, you won't
stay on the shelf for long.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.644
Oh, no.

27:58.745 --> 28:00.880
That's your plan, isn't it?

28:00.947 --> 28:03.049
Cozy up to the Smiths,

28:03.115 --> 28:05.317
get them to marry you off
to somebody important?

28:08.755 --> 28:10.256
I'm joking.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.591
Silly.

28:12.658 --> 28:14.927
- Let's try these on.
- All right.

28:22.835 --> 28:24.937
Wow, that looks
so beautiful on you.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.506
That-- You--
Fits you perfectly.

28:27.573 --> 28:28.775
Come here.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.448
Look,
we could be sisters.

28:39.585 --> 28:42.121
Don't worry.
This is my treat.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.156
Charge these
to Mr. Collins.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.992
Of course.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.060
- Thank you, Lucy.
- Hmm.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.811
Who are these people?

29:04.877 --> 29:07.079
The future of the Reich.

29:11.150 --> 29:12.551
Wait,
they're not all--

29:12.618 --> 29:15.187
Lebensborn?
Ja, some.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.556
You'll know which
after the sun goes down.

29:17.623 --> 29:18.858
We glow in the dark.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.328
Come on.
I think it's time

29:22.394 --> 29:24.831
you experienced
a real Berlin party.

29:30.937 --> 29:32.504
Take it slow, Joe.

29:32.571 --> 29:34.874
We can't be drunk
and do the journey.

29:34.941 --> 29:38.911
Nicki, schatzi!

29:44.851 --> 29:46.919
Joe, meet Hans.
Hans, meet Joe.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.654
Nice to meet you.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.156
Ah, yes. Heusmann's son.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.591
You have been
hiking with Nicole?

29:52.658 --> 29:54.393
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.229
Then you've done
the physical part.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.530
Excuse me?

29:59.832 --> 30:03.502
The outside, the exterior,

30:03.569 --> 30:06.038
the bounty of nature
that man cannot perfect

30:06.105 --> 30:08.908
because it is
already perfect.

30:08.975 --> 30:11.243
Monika, please don't
scare away our guest.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.013
Are you scared?

30:14.080 --> 30:17.316
Because it's turning
to the interior world

30:17.383 --> 30:22.955
that our personal realm
is deeper, darker, chaotic.

30:23.022 --> 30:26.225
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.394
It's an environmentalist
thing, Joe.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.429
No concern of yours.

30:30.496 --> 30:31.898
Of course it is.

30:31.964 --> 30:34.300
The environment
is all of our concern.

30:34.366 --> 30:36.835
Your father's project,
Atlantropa,

30:36.903 --> 30:38.770
it is being peddled
as an economic miracle,

30:38.837 --> 30:40.472
but it is an abomination.

30:40.539 --> 30:42.108
How could stemming
the Mediterranean

30:42.174 --> 30:43.509
be good for the Reich?

30:47.846 --> 30:48.948
I don't know, Hans.

30:49.015 --> 30:51.283
I don't know
anything about it.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.486
Oh, it will have catastrophic
effects on the earth.

30:54.553 --> 30:57.156
Our planet will pay
a heavy price.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.125
And so will you two
if we have to hear
a political lecture.

30:59.191 --> 31:02.561
Come on, let's pick out
the perfect spot.

31:02.628 --> 31:06.165
If they get down
off their high horses,
then they can join us.

31:06.232 --> 31:07.199
Mm.

31:27.486 --> 31:32.358
Have you had much
experience with drugs?

31:32.424 --> 31:34.226
What kind of drugs?

31:34.293 --> 31:37.629
Lysergic acid.
Have you done it?

31:37.696 --> 31:39.231
You'd remember.

31:41.067 --> 31:43.035
One of my father's
biggest sellers.

31:43.102 --> 31:45.137
He only supplies it
to the military,

31:45.204 --> 31:47.639
but I have my ways.

31:47.706 --> 31:48.975
Our parents'
generation

31:49.008 --> 31:50.509
uses it
for mind control--

31:50.576 --> 31:54.513
interrogating
prisoners, for example.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.149
But we use it...

31:57.216 --> 32:01.687
as mind expansion,
as you'll see.

32:05.691 --> 32:09.261
No pressuring.
You can sit this out, Joe.

32:09.328 --> 32:11.397
You seem like you're
open to it,

32:11.463 --> 32:14.833
but if you're not ready yet
to explore inner space--

32:14.900 --> 32:20.672
It's deeper,
darker, chaotic.

32:20.739 --> 32:23.009
You said that already.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.516
You can trust me, Joe.

32:30.582 --> 32:33.619
I'll be here for you
the whole time.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.843
They behave as if were
the end of the world.

32:57.909 --> 33:00.279
It might be.

33:00.346 --> 33:03.449
Fear is never
to be trusted.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.520
Dad, you know who puts
their faith in things

33:08.587 --> 33:11.723
like Yarrow Stalks
and the i Ching?

33:13.425 --> 33:15.361
It's people who don't want
to take responsibility

33:15.427 --> 33:17.063
for the choices
that they've made.

33:17.096 --> 33:18.897
You're wrong.

33:18.964 --> 33:21.700
I take responsibility.

33:23.869 --> 33:26.605
You need to let Mom
move on with her life.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.841
You need
to sign the papers.

33:29.908 --> 33:32.344
That is not your business.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.746
Mom is too polite
to say it herself.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.248
She's too...

33:37.516 --> 33:38.617
Japanese.

33:41.187 --> 33:45.091
I was born there,
but I'm an American now.

33:47.993 --> 33:49.761
Yes.

33:49.828 --> 33:51.663
You are.

33:57.203 --> 33:58.804
So how long
have you known John?

33:58.870 --> 34:00.106
Not long at all.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.174
- Here you are.
- Oh, thank you.

34:02.241 --> 34:04.443
Dreadfully handsome,
isn't he?

34:04.510 --> 34:06.011
Don't worry.
We all think so.

34:06.112 --> 34:07.779
And Helen wouldn't be
annoyed to hear it.

34:07.846 --> 34:09.115
She knows what she's got.

34:09.148 --> 34:11.117
Who did you say
introduced you?

34:11.117 --> 34:12.751
A friend of mine
worked for him.

34:12.818 --> 34:13.785
Joe Blake?

34:13.852 --> 34:16.255
Oh. A friend
or friend?

34:17.689 --> 34:19.125
Well, now I'll just
have to find you

34:19.191 --> 34:20.326
somewhere
suitably glamorous

34:20.392 --> 34:22.361
to wear your pretty
new dress.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.563
Thanks again, Lucy.

34:30.536 --> 34:31.637
What is it?

34:37.042 --> 34:39.245
Lucy? You all right?

34:40.346 --> 34:42.748
Everything's normal.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.252
That's the problem.

34:47.819 --> 34:50.289
Another month and no baby.

34:52.624 --> 34:54.826
Apparently,
these things take time.

34:56.162 --> 34:58.697
We've been trying
for three years.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.868
You should see the way
Henry looks at me now.

35:04.236 --> 35:06.172
His disappointment.

35:07.973 --> 35:09.241
Lucy, I'm so sorry.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.177
It's my fault.

35:11.177 --> 35:12.844
It must be.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.748
But I'm too afraid
to take the test.

35:19.885 --> 35:22.188
Henry's career
would be over.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.194
Something's
wrong with me.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.029
Something's...

35:31.096 --> 35:32.764
broken.

35:35.201 --> 35:37.236
Uh...

35:37.303 --> 35:39.338
there are more important
things, aren't there?

35:39.405 --> 35:42.974
Not in the Reich.

35:43.041 --> 35:45.211
Motherhood is everything.

35:51.049 --> 35:56.288
You know, the Japanese have
a philosophy called Kintsugi.

35:57.489 --> 35:58.724
They take the pieces

35:58.790 --> 36:00.292
of something
that's fallen apart,

36:00.359 --> 36:02.228
and they put it back
together with gold.

36:09.768 --> 36:12.604
Imperfection can
be beautiful, Lucy.

36:20.979 --> 36:24.683
You won't tell Helen...

36:24.750 --> 36:26.084
or the others.

36:26.151 --> 36:27.786
Of course not.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.921
I can trust you, right?

36:29.988 --> 36:31.423
Of course. Come on.

37:22.674 --> 37:25.777
Nicole. Hans.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.053
Juliana.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.027
It really is you.

38:47.559 --> 38:50.061
Everything's all right, Joe.

39:02.273 --> 39:04.075
I'm sorry.

39:05.611 --> 39:09.948
I'm sorry I killed them.
I didn't mean to.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.417
I know.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.822
- I killed you, too.
- No.

39:18.323 --> 39:20.091
It's okay.

39:20.158 --> 39:22.093
I'm alive.

39:36.141 --> 39:38.444
So are you.

39:38.444 --> 39:42.714
Where did she-- you-- go?

39:45.350 --> 39:47.118
I'm dead, too.

39:47.185 --> 39:49.588
Alive, dead,
we're just specks of dust.

39:49.655 --> 39:51.623
We blow away in the wind.

39:52.624 --> 39:53.992
But it makes
no difference.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.393
We make no difference.

39:55.461 --> 39:57.395
Dead or alive
is all the same.

39:58.430 --> 40:00.666
That is the beauty, Joe.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.402
No.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.680
You saved my life.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.515
Please tell me it matters.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.116
Of course it does, Joe.

40:21.720 --> 40:24.422
It means you need
to make it matter.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.526
What the f--

41:22.914 --> 41:24.015
Ohh.

41:38.564 --> 41:39.430
You rested.

41:39.565 --> 41:41.299
That's good.

41:41.366 --> 41:42.701
Mm. Yeah,
I guess I did.

41:44.169 --> 41:45.604
I think I should to go--

41:45.671 --> 41:47.973
Is there a problem?

41:48.039 --> 41:52.243
Just-- Did Hans
see us last night?

41:53.679 --> 41:55.614
Don't worry about him.

41:55.681 --> 41:57.916
Even if he did,
he was busy with Monika.

41:59.450 --> 42:01.052
Monika likes you.

42:01.119 --> 42:02.854
You can have her, too.

42:06.825 --> 42:08.860
I don't want Monika.

42:12.831 --> 42:14.866
I'm ready to go
see my father now.

42:17.502 --> 42:18.870
Good.

43:00.211 --> 43:02.648
I felt sorry for her.

43:02.714 --> 43:04.950
Remember she's a Nazi.

43:05.016 --> 43:08.954
I know.
I didn't expect to.

43:09.020 --> 43:12.057
What about you?
You ever want to have kids?

43:15.260 --> 43:17.228
Why do you ask?

43:17.295 --> 43:21.366
Uh, your mom told me you
were like a mother to Trudy,

43:21.432 --> 43:24.202
the way you looked after her.

43:27.238 --> 43:28.674
Ma wasn't always around,

43:28.707 --> 43:31.242
so a lot of the time
it was just the two of us.

43:33.779 --> 43:36.782
You know, Trudy
had the best imagination.

43:38.149 --> 43:40.852
As long as I could turn it
into a story or a game,

43:40.919 --> 43:42.788
she wasn't afraid of anything.

43:45.724 --> 43:47.192
I used to tell her

43:47.258 --> 43:48.927
that if we waved
at the Japanese bombers

43:48.994 --> 43:50.762
that they would just
keep flying

43:50.829 --> 43:52.731
and they'd leave us alone.

43:52.798 --> 43:55.867
And no bombs would fall
on us as long as we sang.

43:59.504 --> 44:00.972
We used to skip to the shelter

44:01.039 --> 44:03.141
singing "Follow
the Yellow Brick Road."

44:08.413 --> 44:10.716
You remind me of her.

44:14.319 --> 44:18.123
Was it you who got her
involved in the Resistance?

44:23.361 --> 44:25.130
It was her boyfriend,

44:25.196 --> 44:28.734
but I introduced
her to Randall, so...

44:30.468 --> 44:32.170
it's my fault.

44:36.174 --> 44:37.242
I don't know.

44:37.308 --> 44:39.911
Once Trudy made her mind
up about something,

44:39.978 --> 44:42.781
there was no
talking her out of it.

44:44.615 --> 44:47.018
You shouldn't blame yourself.

44:47.085 --> 44:50.188
Thank you for saying that.

44:50.255 --> 44:51.757
When she found you,

44:51.757 --> 44:53.859
Did she say anything
about a way out?

44:55.093 --> 44:56.762
What?

44:56.828 --> 44:57.929
It was just something
she said

44:57.996 --> 45:00.231
one of the last times
we spoke.

45:00.298 --> 45:03.802
She said
she'd found the answer
to everything and...

45:05.503 --> 45:07.172
she'd found the way out.

45:09.340 --> 45:11.943
You think she knew
she was going to die?

45:12.010 --> 45:15.013
That's not what she meant.

45:16.514 --> 45:17.783
You sure?

45:31.963 --> 45:33.564
How was school?

45:33.631 --> 45:36.101
Okay. Thanks.

45:37.702 --> 45:40.205
You're too old to sulk,
Thomas.

45:40.271 --> 45:43.809
Sorry, Father.
It's just, uh...

45:43.875 --> 45:45.376
I just wanted
to tell everyone

45:45.443 --> 45:47.879
that I got picked
for the expedition.

45:47.946 --> 45:49.247
You wanted to brag.

45:49.314 --> 45:50.081
No.

45:50.148 --> 45:52.818
Okay, maybe--
maybe a little.

45:52.851 --> 45:55.887
And especially to that
big-mouth Barker.

45:56.888 --> 45:58.857
But I didn't.

46:00.826 --> 46:03.862
I thought it through
and didn't say anything,

46:03.929 --> 46:06.064
since I don't know
if I'm going or not.

46:07.598 --> 46:09.134
That's very wise.

46:10.902 --> 46:12.971
So, uh...

46:13.038 --> 46:15.640
you said we'd talk
about it tonight.

46:15.706 --> 46:19.377
No. I said we'd
talk about it later.

46:21.746 --> 46:24.582
Well, when's that?

46:24.649 --> 46:26.251
Well, it's unspecified.

46:26.317 --> 46:27.853
That's the beauty of it,
you see--

46:27.919 --> 46:30.221
Speaking of beauty.

46:32.323 --> 46:36.862
Well, at least they'll learn
how to set a table properly,

46:36.895 --> 46:38.864
if nothing else...

46:40.966 --> 46:42.868
in South America.

46:44.702 --> 46:46.872
You mean--

46:46.872 --> 46:48.907
Y-You mean
you're letting me go?

46:49.875 --> 46:51.276
We're letting you go.

46:54.512 --> 46:56.247
Ohh!

46:57.615 --> 46:59.350
You guys are the best.

48:54.199 --> 48:55.366
Ahh.

50:09.240 --> 50:12.777
Tonight I call upon
Chairman Khrushchev

50:12.843 --> 50:17.215
to halt and eliminate
this clandestine, reckless,

50:17.282 --> 50:19.417
and provocative threat
to world peace

50:19.484 --> 50:23.154
and to stable relations
between our two nations.

50:23.221 --> 50:25.323
I call upon him
further to abandon

50:25.390 --> 50:27.558
this course
of world domination

50:27.625 --> 50:30.395
and to join in
an historic effort

50:30.461 --> 50:32.563
to end the perilous arms race

50:32.630 --> 50:35.933
and to transform
the history of man.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.269
He has an opportunity now

50:38.336 --> 50:40.071
to move the world back

50:40.138 --> 50:42.207
from the abyss
of destruction

50:42.273 --> 50:44.975
by withdrawing these
weapons from Cuba,

50:45.042 --> 50:46.944
by refraining
from any action

50:47.011 --> 50:50.215
which will widen or deepen
the present crisis,

50:50.281 --> 50:52.750
and then by participating
in a search

50:52.817 --> 50:55.553
for peaceful
and permanent solutions.

50:57.288 --> 51:00.525
My fellow citizens,
let no one doubt

51:00.591 --> 51:03.994
that this is a difficult
and dangerous epoch

51:04.129 --> 51:05.830
on which we have set out.

51:07.998 --> 51:10.000
No one can foresee precisely

51:10.135 --> 51:11.936
what course it will take

51:12.002 --> 51:15.906
or what costs or casualties
will be incurred.

51:15.973 --> 51:18.809
Many months in which
both our patience

51:18.876 --> 51:21.412
and our will will be tested,

51:21.479 --> 51:24.749
months in which many
threats and denunciations

51:24.815 --> 51:27.552
will keep us aware
of our dangers.

51:27.618 --> 51:30.054
But the greatest
danger of all

51:30.155 --> 51:32.157
would be to do nothing.

51:40.231 --> 51:43.033
Our goal is not
the victory of might

51:43.168 --> 51:44.602
but the vindication of right,

51:44.669 --> 51:47.838
not peace at
the expense of freedom

51:47.905 --> 51:51.809
but both peace and freedom,
here in this hemisphere

51:51.876 --> 51:54.579
and we hope
around the world.

51:54.645 --> 51:58.316
God willing, that goal
will be achieved.
