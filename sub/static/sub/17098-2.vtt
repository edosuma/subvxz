I'd be happy
to recommend you,

07:25.959 --> 07:27.125

you don't have
a high school diploma

of a checkered past.

it will make you a long shot.

that I can do

to make it
less of a long shot?

we could turn this into

wouldn't be entirely
out of question.

08:01.625 --> 08:02.667
Sure.

08:02.709 --> 08:04.291
Yeah. Even better.

08:04.333 --> 08:05.875

if I'm home early,

these two other cats

talking about cats?

-that you can be ready...
-No, no, I can do it.

will look better

08:58.291 --> 08:59.500
in a big space.

08:59.542 --> 09:01.834
I have some ideas
how they could be put up.

uh, high contrast shots

interspersed the underexposed
tableau images...

09:06.750 --> 09:09.667

how this turns out.

18:09.291 --> 18:10.333
Yeah!

18:10.667 --> 18:12.375
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

18:16.834 --> 18:18.417
Though I'm a little light
on cash right now.

18:18.750 --> 18:21.250
(SIGHS) Yeah, I bought
that shirt for the interview.

18:21.291 --> 18:23.083
What do we have to eat here?

18:26.834 --> 18:28.125
A egg.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.333
Why is it in the cupboard?

18:31.709 --> 18:33.458
I really hope
you get that job.

18:42.291 --> 18:43.166
(DOOR CLOSES)

18:43.208 --> 18:44.333
Where you coming from?

18:44.917 --> 18:46.583
My school's Open House.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.083
Where Gerald had an exhibit
because his father

18:49.333 --> 18:51.208
didn't sell all his photos.

18:51.250 --> 18:53.125
Who want to buy
Gerald photo anyway?

18:53.792 --> 18:55.542
He takes good pictures, Appa.

18:55.583 --> 18:56.959
Just not of himself.

18:57.542 --> 18:58.875
I'm going to bed.

18:58.917 --> 19:00.166
Open House is nothing.

19:00.208 --> 19:01.125
To you, maybe.

19:01.166 --> 19:02.667
APPA: Look, Janet.
You teacher,

19:03.166 --> 19:05.375
maybe she know
what she is talking.

19:05.417 --> 19:06.709
Maybe not.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.250
But this is real world.

19:08.792 --> 19:10.500
And in real world,

19:10.542 --> 19:12.583
people want to buy
your picture

19:13.291 --> 19:16.000
because they is
very good picture.

19:18.125 --> 19:19.291
But could be better.

19:21.834 --> 19:22.959
Stop.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.667
It's, uh, second hand,

19:25.709 --> 19:28.125
but he say it's best kind.

19:31.750 --> 19:32.875
You bought this for me?

19:36.083 --> 19:37.417
-Did you use the money you...
-No.

19:38.375 --> 19:40.125
I use my commission.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.250
Thank you, Appa.

19:45.667 --> 19:46.750
It's nice.

19:49.458 --> 19:50.625
Do you mind?

19:51.041 --> 19:52.458
I know someone
who might be interested.

19:54.083 --> 19:56.000
-Who?
-Can't say.

19:56.041 --> 19:57.000
Anonymous buyer.

20:14.041 --> 20:16.250
-KIMCHEE: Nice work, ass man.
-Thanks, Kimch.

20:18.166 --> 20:19.458
Fucking guy.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.500
Congratulation, Mrs. Kim!

20:29.542 --> 20:32.458
You must be so proud of Jung.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.834
Ah, and so relieved to finally
get some good news about him.

20:35.875 --> 20:37.375
If Jung work hard,

20:37.417 --> 20:39.333
some day he become
Regional Manager,

20:39.375 --> 20:40.667
then District Manager,

20:40.709 --> 20:42.041
and then finally,

20:42.083 --> 20:44.625
Vice President
of big automotive company.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.125
TRISH: Wow.
That's impressive.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.166
Yeah. Very impressive.

20:48.709 --> 20:49.792

20:51.417 --> 20:52.750
TRISH: This is your Jung?

20:52.792 --> 20:54.542
He's so handsome!

20:54.583 --> 20:56.625
Successful and handsome.

20:56.667 --> 20:58.125
And single.

20:58.166 --> 20:59.667
Mom, stop trying
to set me up.

20:59.709 --> 21:01.375
Your mommy is right.

21:01.417 --> 21:04.000
Lunch was so delicious.

21:04.041 --> 21:05.834

21:05.875 --> 21:07.333
Thank you ladies so much.

21:07.375 --> 21:08.458
(WOMAN THANKING IN KOREAN)

21:08.500 --> 21:10.375
Oh...

21:10.417 --> 21:12.041

21:12.709 --> 21:14.250
