02:50.348 --> 02:52.908
- Morning.
- Morning. What do you want?

02:55.153 --> 02:56.780
What do you want?

02:56.888 --> 02:58.150
How much?

02:58.256 --> 03:00.247
Twenty-four cents. Cash.

03:02.794 --> 03:05.228
Don't put him in with any other horse,
would you?

03:05.297 --> 03:06.559
Why not?

03:06.732 --> 03:08.495
lt'd just be better.

03:08.734 --> 03:10.361
That'll be extra.

03:15.307 --> 03:18.470
Put him in with another horse,
he's gonna kill him.

03:19.311 --> 03:21.176
That'll be extra for you.

03:21.246 --> 03:23.339
What the hell else does he do?

03:23.415 --> 03:27.112
He can spin in half his own length
in crossfire from either side.

03:27.185 --> 03:30.643
If you drop a dime over in that stall,
don't stoop over to get it.

03:30.722 --> 03:33.691
- Get it with your pitchfork.
- What do you keep him around for?

03:33.759 --> 03:36.626
That's a mother-in-law horse.
Know what that is?

03:36.695 --> 03:40.358
A mother-in-law horse is a horse
you put your mother-in-law on.

03:40.632 --> 03:44.227
Send them both up in the hills
and hope they don't ever come back.

03:44.503 --> 03:45.993
Here's your money.

03:46.071 --> 03:49.199
He just all-around looks after
my best welfare.

03:50.108 --> 03:52.508
I'm going out and get a morning whiskey.

03:52.844 --> 03:56.439
If all goes wrong,
I'll come back and sleep in that stall.

03:56.515 --> 03:57.777
What about your tack?

03:57.849 --> 04:00.283
Just leave it in there.
Anybody that's brave enough...

04:00.352 --> 04:03.446
to go in there and get it,
they're welcome to it.

04:10.162 --> 04:13.290
- Harry, pass the champagne.
- Breakfast champagne in Hagersville.

04:13.365 --> 04:16.926
Now, how can I pass the champagne
when Dexter here drank it all?

04:17.002 --> 04:18.629
Barkeep, a little more champagne.

04:18.702 --> 04:20.170
Soon as we get to San Francisco...

04:20.238 --> 04:22.468
I want to check out
where Mahare is training.

04:22.541 --> 04:25.942
Gonna be pretty tough.
I understand he's copying your style, Jim.

04:26.011 --> 04:27.535
I'm not worried about him.

04:27.612 --> 04:29.978
The last 10 guys he faced,
he knocked them out.

04:30.048 --> 04:31.879
He's never seen Jim's footwork, either.

04:31.950 --> 04:35.886
Remember that Florida fight? You were
so fast, he couldn't land a punch.

04:36.621 --> 04:39.886
That new punch of yours
is the greatest in the game.

04:40.292 --> 04:43.022
Tex, did you ever hear of a hook punch?

04:43.862 --> 04:45.022
No, I haven't.

04:45.096 --> 04:48.497
We're toasting the man
with the greatest hook punch in the world.

04:48.567 --> 04:51.968
Barkeep, give Tex some champagne
so that he can toast with us.

04:52.037 --> 04:54.665
- I'd rather have whiskey.
- Give him anything he wants.

04:54.739 --> 04:57.799
Jim, you brought a touch of class
to this game.

04:57.976 --> 05:00.069
And a lot of pretty ladies.

05:02.047 --> 05:03.844
Tex, you ready?

05:04.516 --> 05:05.744
What are we toasting?

05:05.817 --> 05:08.650
We're toasting the next
heavyweight champion of the world:

05:08.720 --> 05:10.585
"Gentleman Jim" Corbett.

05:10.655 --> 05:13.886
He's gotta fight for it yet,
so he ain't champion.

05:13.959 --> 05:15.722
Why don't we toast
something interesting?

05:15.794 --> 05:16.886
Like what?

05:17.195 --> 05:20.221
Like Geronimo there. He's interesting.

05:20.298 --> 05:22.732
In a pig's ass. Don't you read the papers?

05:22.801 --> 05:24.962
They put Geronimo in jail,
where he belongs.

05:25.036 --> 05:27.095
Let me ask you something, Tex.

05:27.172 --> 05:29.663
Who's Geronimo next to Jim Corbett?

05:30.442 --> 05:31.909
Geronimo's a man so great...

05:31.977 --> 05:36.038
that Corbett there'd have to stand
on his mother's shoulders to kiss his ass.

05:36.114 --> 05:37.308
Frank.

05:53.999 --> 05:56.126
- What's your name?
- Tom Horn.

05:56.902 --> 05:58.665
Do you have a gun, Tom?

06:00.071 --> 06:01.800
- No, I don't.
- Good.

06:02.407 --> 06:05.399
Then you're gonna get
exactly what you deserve.

06:05.510 --> 06:07.068
I don't know where you come from...

06:07.145 --> 06:10.273
but the manners that you arrived with
are just awful.

06:11.216 --> 06:13.980
I'm trying to imagine
how you could make such a reference...

06:14.052 --> 06:16.987
to the mother of the future
heavyweight champion of the world.

06:17.055 --> 06:20.957
You ain't champion yet.
Besides, you're acting like an asshole.

06:21.159 --> 06:24.094
- I could go to the penitentiary over you.
- Now, wait a minute.

06:24.162 --> 06:26.824
Before we start this fight,
I wanna ask you one question.

06:26.898 --> 06:29.867
- Is it about my mother?
- No. I've said enough about her.

06:29.935 --> 06:32.768
If I win this fight,
am I the champion of the world?

06:32.837 --> 06:33.895
You're not big enough.

06:33.972 --> 06:36.634
Then what are you picking on
a little fellow like me for?

06:36.708 --> 06:40.576
You get in a fight in a public bar,
they'll discredit you from your profession.

06:40.645 --> 06:42.306
I'm gonna save you from that.

06:42.380 --> 06:43.938
That ain't the real Tom Horn, is it?

06:44.015 --> 06:46.483
He doesn't seem to be
too scared of Corbett.

06:46.551 --> 06:47.916
He's gonna get himself killed.

06:52.657 --> 06:54.522
Lord, the end is here.

06:56.127 --> 06:58.823
- Is Tom Horn in there?
- Yeah, he's here.

06:58.897 --> 07:00.728
Last stall on the right.

07:00.799 --> 07:03.700
But I wouldn't go in there
with that horse if I were you.

07:03.768 --> 07:05.759
That son of a bitch is harebrained.

07:05.837 --> 07:07.964
He's got him trained to stand people off.

07:08.039 --> 07:11.998
Well, he's a hero of the frontier
and he's lying here in Hagersville...

07:12.077 --> 07:14.045
with his face kicked in.

07:17.115 --> 07:19.015
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.009
How bad you hurt?

07:21.086 --> 07:22.986
Wasn't much of a party.

07:24.022 --> 07:27.082
Say, you another one
of those newspaper guys?

07:27.158 --> 07:31.060
No, I ain't, but I'd like to get you out
from under that horse if I can.

07:32.530 --> 07:35.090
Open up that gate and I'll walk him out.

07:44.943 --> 07:46.934
Let me ask you something.

07:47.812 --> 07:50.474
- Are you in fact Tom Horn?
- Yes, I am.

07:54.219 --> 07:55.686
Goddamn, Tom.

08:01.359 --> 08:04.760
You know, here in Jerkville,
where these yokels...

08:04.929 --> 08:08.262
is busy flicking dandruff
off their mail-order suits...

08:08.333 --> 08:11.769
they forget awful quick
that it was men like you that made it...

08:11.836 --> 08:15.795
safe and possible for them
to lead out their dull little lives.

08:15.874 --> 08:18.900
Right now,
I wish I had nothing to do with it.

08:21.846 --> 08:23.973
- What's your name?
- John Coble.

08:24.682 --> 08:27.207
What can I do for you, John?

08:27.619 --> 08:31.885
Well, first, I'd like to offer you my ranch
till you get recovered.

08:32.057 --> 08:35.049
<i>And then I'd like to offer you work...</i>

08:35.193 --> 08:38.162
<i>that suits both your ability</i>
<i>and your quality.</i>

08:38.229 --> 08:40.857
<i>I'm a fair hand, and I'll earn my keep.</i>

08:40.932 --> 08:43.025
<i>Yeah, I know you will, Tom.</i>

08:44.235 --> 08:47.796
We better stop and water our horses
here at Brown's Hole.

08:49.274 --> 08:51.970
We should move on as quickly as we can.

09:08.660 --> 09:11.458
Tom, some of those cows in there
are mine.

09:12.097 --> 09:14.258
What are you looking at, Mr. Coble?

09:14.332 --> 09:18.393
We're just gonna water our horses,
and we'll be moving on.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.938
You like to buy some of them cows?

09:21.706 --> 09:25.574
I don't want no trouble, and like I say,
we'll be moving on.

09:55.540 --> 09:57.508
How about a little dance?

09:58.676 --> 10:01.110
Give us a little dance, Mr. Coble.

10:04.249 --> 10:05.409
Dance.

10:06.017 --> 10:07.177
I said dance.

10:16.661 --> 10:20.062
All right, Mr. Coble,
why don't you just ride on out?

10:28.740 --> 10:31.903
Get that shooter
and put it in this water trough.

10:33.945 --> 10:35.037
Move!

10:48.359 --> 10:52.261
You son of a bitch!
I'll get you, you son of a bitch!

10:52.997 --> 10:55.465
Tom, that little deal
back there at Brown's Hole...

10:55.533 --> 10:59.196
ought to give you an idea of what
we've been putting up with out here.

11:35.073 --> 11:37.234
I ain't never seen roping like that. Damn!

11:37.308 --> 11:39.071
He sure don't rope like no Christian.

11:43.248 --> 11:44.875
I wanna tell you.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.483
Any means that you have to take...

11:47.552 --> 11:49.850
to eliminate this rustling problem...

11:51.122 --> 11:53.613
we're all behind you 100%.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.753
- Whole organization?
- All of us.

11:59.430 --> 12:02.627
<i>I'll just have to take your word</i>
<i>on that, John.</i>

12:03.368 --> 12:04.733
<i>You got it.</i>

12:41.005 --> 12:43.030
Hey, Tom. How you feeling?

12:43.107 --> 12:44.699
We're plugging along.

12:44.776 --> 12:48.803
I'm giving a little party at the house.
I'd like you to meet everybody.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.348
- I'm kind of raggedy.
- Nobody'll mind.

12:51.416 --> 12:55.011
Most of the Association will be there,
and they're all anxious to meet you.

12:55.086 --> 12:56.212
Okay.

13:06.564 --> 13:07.997
Pipe down.

13:09.334 --> 13:13.236
Ladies and gentlemen,
in this age of quarter-section pastures...

13:13.304 --> 13:16.705
and tinhorn legislators
who is riding our old trails...

13:16.874 --> 13:20.935
it's a real pleasure to welcome
a vestige of that heroic era...

13:21.012 --> 13:22.912
that we just about lost.

13:22.980 --> 13:25.175
Standing beside me, right here...

13:25.249 --> 13:29.709
is the legendary tracker and interpreter
of the Apache wars...

13:30.455 --> 13:31.717
Tom Horn.

13:38.429 --> 13:40.158
You're welcome, sir.

13:41.499 --> 13:43.592
Tom, this is Arlo Chance.

13:44.936 --> 13:46.631
- Tom.
- Ora Haley.

13:46.704 --> 13:47.932
Howdy.

13:48.005 --> 13:49.802
- lan MacGregor.
- Proud to meet you.

14:10.428 --> 14:12.328
What's the matter, Tom?

14:12.597 --> 14:14.724
- What is it?
- It's a lobster.

14:16.134 --> 14:19.592
I'll be darned.
I've never eaten a bug that big before.

14:20.505 --> 14:24.305
That's a Maine lobster.
Broiled alive, packaged in seaweed...

14:24.375 --> 14:26.639
and shipped out here by train.

14:26.878 --> 14:31.315
At every station, the conductor drains
the melted seawater off of them.

14:46.998 --> 14:49.728
- You getting the hang of it?
- I'm trying.

15:00.478 --> 15:03.174
Tom, I don't know
whether John here told you...

15:03.247 --> 15:05.772
but we've got
a hell of a range problem here.

15:05.850 --> 15:09.650
The damn rustlers have
completely wiped out our herd profits...

15:10.421 --> 15:12.013
not to mention...

15:12.089 --> 15:15.490
what the buzzards and the predators
have done to our cash crops.

15:15.560 --> 15:18.586
We got people
homesteading our rangeland...

15:18.663 --> 15:20.756
and raising sheep on our grass.

15:21.299 --> 15:25.633
Right at the present time, Mr. Horn,
what's your primary source of livelihood?

15:25.703 --> 15:29.104
Mr. Coble offered me
to ease up at his place for a while...

15:29.173 --> 15:30.731
and I said I'd earn my keep.

15:30.808 --> 15:32.105
That's good enough.

15:32.477 --> 15:35.412
Tom, you met Joe Belle?
United States Marshal.

15:35.480 --> 15:36.674
Hello.

15:37.048 --> 15:39.175
I'm not wanted for anything, am I?

15:39.517 --> 15:41.144
Why don't you two fellows see...

15:41.219 --> 15:43.881
if you can get your heads together
for a few minutes?

15:43.955 --> 15:44.979
Go ahead.

15:45.056 --> 15:47.957
- Do you know who I am?
- No.

15:50.761 --> 15:53.093
What you used to be in the southwest...

15:53.164 --> 15:54.859
I used to be in the northwest.

15:54.932 --> 15:56.593
How does that work?

15:57.602 --> 16:00.901
I know that you've been,
as I've been, a man hunter.

16:01.072 --> 16:02.664
I was a tracker.

16:04.442 --> 16:05.909
Better still.

16:06.944 --> 16:10.311
John Coble's put in
a pretty fervent recommendation for you...

16:10.381 --> 16:13.680
to The Cattlemen's Association
to help control the rustling.

16:14.218 --> 16:16.311
I believe his point was...

16:16.387 --> 16:19.845
handling rustlers after your experience
with the Apache wars...

16:19.924 --> 16:22.415
should be like shooting fish in a barrel.

16:22.493 --> 16:24.654
Now, you're talking about...

16:24.862 --> 16:27.888
the high side of shooting
and the low side of the law.

16:29.367 --> 16:33.633
Bring them to trial if you like.
I feel that what I know about you...

16:33.905 --> 16:36.499
you're gonna wanna go ahead and shoot.

16:36.874 --> 16:41.402
From the standpoint of the Association,
that's going to be entirely up to you.

16:42.747 --> 16:45.272
Whether I bring them in or shoot?

16:46.050 --> 16:47.813
Is your problem.

16:50.788 --> 16:53.757
You're a U.S. Marshal.
You tell me, what's the difference...

16:53.824 --> 16:57.157
between a U.S. Marshal and an assassin?

16:59.564 --> 17:02.089
A Marshal's checks come in on time.

17:11.608 --> 17:15.511
Say, did Buffalo Bill ever ask you
to be in his Wild West Show?

17:16.981 --> 17:21.247
Yeah, he asked me once out in Arizona,
where we had a lot of people killed.

17:22.752 --> 17:24.743
He offered me my own act.

17:25.056 --> 17:28.048
Like I said, we had a lot of people killed.

17:29.827 --> 17:30.919
Joe.

17:31.996 --> 17:34.521
- Can I talk with you a minute?
- Sure.

17:45.943 --> 17:49.709
Man of the West, Indian tracker,
and scared to death of lobster.

17:52.950 --> 17:54.747
It was my first time.

17:58.022 --> 17:59.546
What do you...

17:59.624 --> 18:00.955
Teach school.

18:01.025 --> 18:02.492
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:03.260 --> 18:05.660
- What were you going to ask me?
- That.

18:05.963 --> 18:07.828
- What?
- What you do.

18:08.532 --> 18:10.056
I teach school.

18:10.735 --> 18:12.396
School teacher?

18:15.439 --> 18:18.135
What was it like out in Indian territory?

18:20.611 --> 18:22.135
Lonely as hell.

18:26.851 --> 18:29.649
- What did you do out in the West?
- Cowboy.

18:31.822 --> 18:34.017
What do you do for Mr. Coble?

18:34.258 --> 18:35.350
Cowboy.

18:35.559 --> 18:37.993
Joe, I think we've found our man.

18:39.096 --> 18:42.065
Not anything in Brown's Hole
I couldn't take care of.

18:42.166 --> 18:45.067
Well, I think Horn's reputation...

18:45.136 --> 18:48.867
might be as effective
as his Winchester is here.

18:48.939 --> 18:53.171
I have quite a good reputation myself.
It always seems to precede me.

18:53.377 --> 18:55.572
I know that, Joe, but...

18:55.680 --> 19:00.049
your political ambitions are gonna
fit right in with our future plans.

19:00.117 --> 19:02.813
Now, we don't wanna forget that, do we?

19:03.454 --> 19:04.785
And, besides...

19:04.855 --> 19:08.985
there won't be no chocolate cake
for Horn up there at Brown's Hole.

19:10.261 --> 19:12.923
- Where are you from originally?
- Hawaii.

19:13.931 --> 19:15.125
Hawaii?

19:15.299 --> 19:16.766
Yeah, Hawaii.

19:17.535 --> 19:20.060
Did you live in one of those grass huts?

19:20.471 --> 19:21.870
In a hotel.

19:22.606 --> 19:25.166
- They have those there?
- Sure they do.

19:25.576 --> 19:28.443
Sure come a long way
to teach school in Wyoming.

19:28.746 --> 19:31.806
I guess you could say
I've had a romance with the West...

19:31.882 --> 19:33.873
since I was old enough to read.

19:34.485 --> 19:36.817
- You miss that ocean?
- Sometimes.

19:38.723 --> 19:41.385
You know, I never learned how to ride.

19:41.926 --> 19:43.416
Is that right?

19:44.295 --> 19:45.626
Glendolene.

19:47.932 --> 19:51.333
It's a nice afternoon, John.
I enjoyed my lobster.

19:51.402 --> 19:53.165
And I know Mr. Horn did, too.

19:53.237 --> 19:55.000
I'm glad you liked it.

19:55.072 --> 19:57.404
- Excellent afternoon, John.
- Joe.

19:58.442 --> 19:59.602
Tom.

20:08.085 --> 20:09.950
Giddap.

20:16.827 --> 20:20.228
The way I see this,
you'll be a stock detective.

20:21.465 --> 20:25.629
See that the rustling gets stopped.
You can stay here at the ranch...

20:25.703 --> 20:27.830
and I'll pay your wages as a cowhand.

20:27.905 --> 20:31.932
$200 for every rustler
that goes somewhere else...

20:32.009 --> 20:33.636
to ply his trade.

20:41.952 --> 20:44.045
- Who do I report to?
- To me.

20:46.323 --> 20:50.384
And as far as you are concerned,
you and Joe Belle never discussed this.

20:50.628 --> 20:53.392
And for that matter, neither have I.

21:18.255 --> 21:19.620
Twenty-five. Do I hear 25?

21:19.690 --> 21:22.784
Would you bid 30? Thank you.
Now a half. Would you bid a half?

21:22.860 --> 21:25.021
Would you bid 35? 40. Thank you, sir.

21:25.095 --> 21:27.825
Now a half. Would you bid a half?
75. Got a dollar.

21:27.898 --> 21:29.957
How about going on for a half? $1.50.

21:30.034 --> 21:32.366
Would you bid $2? Did I hear $2?

21:32.436 --> 21:34.267
I got $2 right over here. Thank you, sir.

21:34.338 --> 21:37.432
Sold to Western Trail Packing Company
for $2.

21:38.175 --> 21:40.405
Could I see that bill of sale?

21:48.018 --> 21:49.451
Thank you, son.

21:52.489 --> 21:54.980
You consider this an actual bill of sale?

21:55.626 --> 21:57.526
I'm just the auctioneer, sir.

21:57.595 --> 22:00.029
The bill of sale's been sworn to.

22:00.097 --> 22:02.224
Well, whoever swore to it...

22:02.900 --> 22:05.164
was a liar and a cow thief.

22:05.703 --> 22:09.503
Those cows belong to John Coble
of the Wood River Cattle Company.

22:09.573 --> 22:11.370
Who the hell are you?

22:13.210 --> 22:14.677
Stock detective.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.471
What's a stock detective?

22:18.816 --> 22:19.874
Me.

22:20.317 --> 22:22.842
You may call yourself
some kind of stock detective...

22:22.920 --> 22:26.014
but I'm a deputy sheriff,
and I'm the law here.

22:27.157 --> 22:30.251
Lock these men up. I'll file the charges.

22:30.327 --> 22:33.785
Nobody's going to jail,
unless you start some trouble.

22:34.365 --> 22:35.525
I see.

22:35.666 --> 22:38.601
I'll tell you what, Horn. I'm gonna kill you.

22:38.836 --> 22:40.667
You ain't gonna kill nobody.

22:40.771 --> 22:42.329
If he don't, I will.

22:42.406 --> 22:46.172
- Your damn charges ain't gonna stick.
- lf the charges don't stick...

22:47.878 --> 22:50.574
I'll just take it between us
as who gets who first.

22:50.648 --> 22:52.616
That's how it's gonna be, then.

22:52.683 --> 22:54.275
There won't be no more cows stolen.

22:54.351 --> 22:56.376
Not from
the Wood River Cattle Company...

22:56.453 --> 23:00.287
the Bar-Three Cattle Company,
or the Haley Cattle Company.

23:00.724 --> 23:03.488
Consider that my last word on the matter.

23:19.743 --> 23:21.335
Come on, boys, let's have an auction.

24:15.699 --> 24:18.031
You know, I got a weird feeling.

24:18.135 --> 24:19.534
Yo, me too.

24:19.837 --> 24:21.600
We're being followed.

24:23.307 --> 24:24.672
Look!

28:08.966 --> 28:11.025
Tell them what you saw here.

30:44.688 --> 30:46.212
That you, Horn?

31:18.054 --> 31:20.181
You coming in here after me?

32:37.400 --> 32:38.799
Giddap! Come on.

32:44.808 --> 32:46.503
Get them up there.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.434
Hang in there. Come on.

33:18.942 --> 33:21.809
Let him stop first, then give him slack.

33:27.851 --> 33:29.375
Hitch him up.

33:31.254 --> 33:32.778
Hang in there.

33:46.202 --> 33:48.966
Ease up on him there. You got him.

34:14.764 --> 34:17.096
Yeah, he's a good horse. You go ahead...

34:17.167 --> 34:19.226
ride him around a little bit
and tire him out.

34:19.302 --> 34:23.033
Keep his head up. If you keep his head up,
he ain't gonna buck.

34:24.641 --> 34:27.405
- Could I talk to you a minute?
- You bet.

34:27.844 --> 34:31.405
All right, you go ahead
and take the rough off of him.

34:31.481 --> 34:35.042
I'll come back after he's quieted down
and put a handle on him.

34:36.686 --> 34:39.280
What'll I do if I get into a real storm
with this horse?

34:39.356 --> 34:43.452
Just get off of him the best you can,
but don't let him roll in that saddle.

34:47.964 --> 34:49.556
I think that...

34:51.266 --> 34:53.599
I need that horse!

34:57.540 --> 34:59.735
Shit. Stop that horse!

35:00.510 --> 35:02.171
I need that horse.

35:03.346 --> 35:04.574
Get that horse.

35:08.485 --> 35:10.544
I can understand you smaller children...

35:10.620 --> 35:13.214
but you older children have no excuses.

35:13.289 --> 35:16.315
So, we're going to stay
until you get it right.

35:16.393 --> 35:20.124
Now, I don't want any erasures,
so turn the page and start fresh.

35:22.198 --> 35:24.428
Put that mouse in your pocket.

35:39.215 --> 35:40.807
I brung you a horse.

35:43.620 --> 35:45.281
Class dismissed.

35:56.466 --> 35:58.559
Lord, it's like a stampede.

36:03.173 --> 36:05.607
- I'm not dressed for riding.
- Sure.

36:08.111 --> 36:09.908
Go on home. Go on.

36:12.382 --> 36:15.146
- I'm not dressed for riding.
- Why, sure you are.

36:15.218 --> 36:17.982
Why, women ride all the time
dressed like that.

36:18.054 --> 36:20.022
I busted that horse for you.

36:20.090 --> 36:22.524
Come on, I'll boot you up on him.

36:58.328 --> 37:01.229
- He's beautiful.
- He's a good horse.

37:02.198 --> 37:04.530
Come on, I'll put you up there.

37:07.270 --> 37:08.567
Okay. Done.

37:10.006 --> 37:11.371
You all right?

37:11.441 --> 37:13.568
- How do I get...
- Take hold of these reins.

37:13.643 --> 37:16.874
Grab his reins,
grab a little handful of his mane.

37:18.815 --> 37:21.375
Give him a little kick in the slats.

37:22.285 --> 37:25.311
Yeah. Hold on with your thighs.

37:25.889 --> 37:29.052
That's it. Kind of roll your hips a little.

37:29.692 --> 37:32.286
Roll your hips along with the horse.

37:33.797 --> 37:35.287
You ride good.

38:24.714 --> 38:27.911
So, I finally got my teaching diploma...

38:27.984 --> 38:31.818
and I taught in Cincinnati for a while,
and Denver, and...

38:32.255 --> 38:34.416
Well, I've been everywhere.

38:35.124 --> 38:36.614
I'm an adventuress.

38:36.693 --> 38:39.890
I thought that was a girl
that worked in dance halls.

38:40.163 --> 38:44.395
- No?
- No. That's a girl who goes on adventures.

38:46.970 --> 38:49.666
How do you figure this day
we're having out here?

38:49.739 --> 38:51.570
- An adventure.
- Yeah?

38:56.779 --> 38:59.441
How do I work into it, this adventure?

39:06.990 --> 39:10.426
I see a man of the Old West
trying to live in the New.

39:11.461 --> 39:15.192
Do you know how raggedy-ass
and terrible the Old West really was?

39:15.265 --> 39:18.063
- No.
- lf you spend any time with me...

39:18.134 --> 39:21.035
you'll find out just how
raggedy-ass it was.

39:22.372 --> 39:24.602
You love it out here, don't you?

39:25.108 --> 39:26.439
Yes, I do.

40:06.316 --> 40:08.284
- Morning.
- Good morning.

40:10.086 --> 40:12.316
Looking for Lee Mendenhour's place.

40:12.789 --> 40:15.314
Two drainages over is a little basin.

40:15.692 --> 40:18.286
Lee is situated on the morning side.

40:21.631 --> 40:25.499
- What's your name?
- Tom Horn.

40:25.902 --> 40:27.870
Well, I thought maybe.

40:28.338 --> 40:31.034
Look, I ain't never stole nothing.

40:31.774 --> 40:33.867
I sure am sorry about Lee.

40:34.177 --> 40:37.669
- He wasn't too damn bad a fellow.
- He's still with us.

40:38.214 --> 40:39.613
He is now.

40:41.651 --> 40:44.142
Well, he weren't too bad a fellow.

41:38.074 --> 41:40.770
Those are Coble's cattle
you're running there.

41:41.110 --> 41:42.702
Same old deal.

41:43.079 --> 41:45.206
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.

41:45.615 --> 41:48.106
You get my note,
tell you to get out of this area?

41:48.184 --> 41:50.379
Yeah, I got your fucking note.

41:50.453 --> 41:53.650
I rolled it up with some tobacco
and I smoked it.

41:53.723 --> 41:55.452
That what I did, champion.

42:26.289 --> 42:28.689
You killed my horse, you son of a bitch.

43:35.258 --> 43:37.192
- How are you?
- Morning.

47:07.370 --> 47:08.769
Howdy, John.

47:09.138 --> 47:10.469
Gentlemen.

47:13.209 --> 47:16.269
It's this Horn situation. We got a problem.

47:17.246 --> 47:20.943
You think maybe he might be
just a little bit too protective?

47:21.417 --> 47:24.750
You know we still got
the Nolt sheep problem on the south fork.

47:24.820 --> 47:26.651
But the rustling has stopped.

47:26.722 --> 47:29.885
Yeah. I think it's his rifle
every bit as much as his reputation...

47:29.959 --> 47:31.187
that's done that.

47:31.260 --> 47:34.491
It's almost a foregone conclusion
that this fellow's working for us.

47:34.563 --> 47:38.294
You know, after that incident in town,
we're just within one damn inch...

47:38.367 --> 47:41.268
of having our names splattered
all over the newspaper...

47:41.337 --> 47:44.238
and I don't have to tell you
what an embarrassing situation...

47:44.306 --> 47:45.671
that can put all of us in.

47:45.741 --> 47:47.436
What do you suggest?

47:47.610 --> 47:50.602
John, we just can no longer
afford this fellow.

47:50.846 --> 47:53.644
He's only doing
what we hired him to do, you know.

47:53.716 --> 47:57.152
The time has come for us
to divest ourselves of this Mr. Horn.

47:59.722 --> 48:00.814
How?

48:00.890 --> 48:04.121
I think Joe there
is the answer to that question.

48:13.636 --> 48:16.628
Let this thing lie down, John. Understand?

48:20.843 --> 48:22.470
Thank you, John.

49:27.776 --> 49:29.243
<i>Bob, look at this:</i>

49:29.311 --> 49:32.508
<i>"Man thrown in prison</i>
<i>for eloping with his sister-in-law. "</i>

49:32.581 --> 49:34.879
I'll be. I wonder what he did.

49:38.988 --> 49:41.081
Put down the paper and play.

49:45.427 --> 49:46.758
It's cold.

49:49.999 --> 49:52.126
Nolt boy got killed, Tom.

49:53.769 --> 49:56.397
- Who's that?
- Nolt boy, Jimmy Nolt.

50:00.376 --> 50:01.900
How did that happen?

50:01.977 --> 50:04.070
Shot with a.45-.60.

50:05.247 --> 50:07.147
That's what I shoot, a.45-.60.

50:08.384 --> 50:09.976
Shoot what, Tom?

50:12.821 --> 50:14.413
Prairie dog.

50:47.790 --> 50:50.520
- Jimmy Nolt's dead.
- Yeah.

50:52.161 --> 50:53.890
Where's your horse?

50:55.130 --> 50:56.654
He's dead, too.

51:22.825 --> 51:24.417
I knew you'd be there.

51:25.594 --> 51:27.357
- You did not.
- Okay.

51:29.498 --> 51:31.125
I heard the news.

51:32.701 --> 51:35.693
You still working that horse
I started for you?

51:35.771 --> 51:37.739
It's about the Nolt boy.

51:38.273 --> 51:39.570
What about him?

51:39.842 --> 51:41.571
They found a rock under his head.

51:41.644 --> 51:44.442
Like those other three fellows
from Brown's Hole.

51:45.280 --> 51:47.271
You seen Joe Belle around?

51:47.349 --> 51:50.250
The Association sent him up
to talk to Coble.

51:50.753 --> 51:54.245
Trying to figure what they're gonna do
with a child killer like Tom Horn.

51:54.323 --> 51:56.018
People think you did it.

52:00.729 --> 52:03.698
You don't understand what's going on,
do you?

52:04.700 --> 52:06.668
No, I can't say as I do.

52:07.436 --> 52:09.301
What are you thinking?

52:09.872 --> 52:12.067
I'm thinking I want a drink.

52:50.946 --> 52:52.436
Whiskey, George.

53:01.123 --> 53:02.750
Leave the bottle.

53:18.540 --> 53:21.338
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all right, Charles.

53:23.345 --> 53:26.246
- Let's get started.
- What'll I need, Joe?

53:26.515 --> 53:28.210
Just your writing things.

53:28.283 --> 53:29.773
Where's Tom Horn?

53:29.918 --> 53:32.352
He's over to the Interocean Hotel.

53:33.589 --> 53:35.819
What kind of condition is he in?

53:36.959 --> 53:40.861
He'll be just about where we want him
by the time we get set up.

53:41.163 --> 53:42.255
Come on over here.

53:42.331 --> 53:44.959
We got a mattress laid out here
for you behind the door.

53:45.033 --> 53:48.127
- Can you write okay lying down?
- Can you rig me a little light?

53:48.203 --> 53:49.670
Absolutely.

53:50.205 --> 53:54.198
Got the bottom of the door planed off
so you can hear real good.

53:54.576 --> 53:56.771
But you got to be real quiet.

53:57.045 --> 53:59.809
Joe, what if Tom Horn sees me in there?

54:01.416 --> 54:03.748
- You mean, will he kill you?
- Yes.

54:04.787 --> 54:07.119
I'm not going to let that happen, Charles.

54:07.189 --> 54:09.521
A man like that you don't want
to get mad at you.

54:09.591 --> 54:12.219
I'm going to be sitting
right over there at my desk.

54:12.294 --> 54:14.558
I've got this Colt patent.44 in my vest...

54:14.630 --> 54:17.428
and a German automatic
over there in the drawer...

54:17.499 --> 54:19.865
one of the new ones. What I need is...

54:19.935 --> 54:23.302
for Tom Horn to talk himself
into a terrible tangle...

54:23.372 --> 54:25.340
and for you to get it down on paper.

54:25.407 --> 54:28.501
It's no good for us
just to write it down later.

54:28.677 --> 54:30.668
You mean it has to be in his own words?

54:30.746 --> 54:33.180
Just like I said, Charles.

54:45.828 --> 54:47.193
Hello, Tom.

54:48.831 --> 54:50.162
Hello, Joe.

54:50.332 --> 54:53.699
I got a letter yesterday
from a fellow up in Montana.

54:54.069 --> 54:55.627
What'd he want?

54:56.805 --> 54:59.831
I'm not so sure
this is the spot to be talking.

55:00.175 --> 55:03.372
Got a bottle of mescal in my office,
and it's quiet.

55:04.346 --> 55:05.438
Sure.

55:23.866 --> 55:26.460
You've spent some time in the hills,
haven't you?

55:26.535 --> 55:28.400
Most of my life, Tom.

55:29.271 --> 55:32.604
- But the world is changing fast.
- I can see that.

55:34.276 --> 55:36.676
And a man had better get with it.

55:37.246 --> 55:40.647
I've been trying to work
a few things out in my mind.

55:40.716 --> 55:45.210
Staying in a hotel and being able
to get a drink right away seems to help.

55:46.421 --> 55:49.447
Think you'll ever get back
in them hills again?

55:49.524 --> 55:52.118
I don't know. Scares me to death.

56:06.141 --> 56:10.373
I see you're carrying a belly gun.
I've never known you to do that before.

56:10.445 --> 56:12.970
Well, carrying a rifle in town and all...

56:17.452 --> 56:19.920
I got this inquiry from Montana...

56:19.988 --> 56:23.617
for a man who could come up there
and see to himself...

56:24.826 --> 56:27.090
and look to a few things that-a-way...

56:27.829 --> 56:32.323
in respect to the cattle stealing going on
in the Big Moon up there in that district.

56:32.401 --> 56:35.564
- What's required?
- Some ability with a rifle.

56:42.377 --> 56:46.336
You know, Joe,
nobody ever offered to give me an office.

56:47.549 --> 56:50.916
- Make you feel kind of special, does it?
- I don't know.

56:51.586 --> 56:53.781
If I had your ability with a rifle...

56:53.855 --> 56:56.847
nobody would ever expect me
to come in out of the field.

56:56.925 --> 56:59.689
As it is, I spend half my time
on the railroad...

56:59.795 --> 57:03.424
handcuffed to some petty criminal,
as just a delivery man.

57:05.267 --> 57:08.031
What's the best shot you ever made, Tom?

57:08.570 --> 57:10.037
I don't know.

57:11.606 --> 57:13.471
What about Mendenhour?

57:14.042 --> 57:17.170
If it was me,
I'd say it wasn't much of a shot.

57:20.916 --> 57:24.511
Wouldn't you rather shoot a Sharps.50
instead of that.45-.60?

57:24.586 --> 57:27.783
Those old buffalo guns carry better,
but with a.45-.60...

57:27.856 --> 57:31.519
you can get rounds at any general store.
Keeps a drygulcher in business.

57:32.294 --> 57:34.728
Tom, on the killing of this kid...

57:35.230 --> 57:37.425
- that was quite a shot.
- Was it?

57:38.667 --> 57:40.794
Two hundred thirteen yards.

57:41.670 --> 57:43.865
What do you know about that?

57:44.139 --> 57:45.970
What I just told you.

57:47.809 --> 57:49.902
You afraid of dying, Joe?

57:53.548 --> 57:55.243
Yes, I am.

57:57.919 --> 58:02.288
I am afraid of losing my ability
to be able to come and go as I please.

58:02.657 --> 58:04.386
Lose my freedom.

58:04.893 --> 58:07.794
Not be able to get back up
in those hills again.

58:07.863 --> 58:09.592
What would they do to a man...

58:09.664 --> 58:12.326
that killed a 15-year-old boy
with a Winchester?

58:12.401 --> 58:14.767
I believe that man would have to die.

58:14.903 --> 58:19.067
And you believe that a.45-.60
that's got a trajectory like a rainbow...

58:19.141 --> 58:20.665
could make that shot?

58:21.476 --> 58:23.376
I know it could happen.

58:31.420 --> 58:33.547
If I'd have killed that kid...

58:33.622 --> 58:36.182
it would have been
the best shot I ever made...

58:36.258 --> 58:38.590
and the dirtiest trick I ever done.

01:00:17.359 --> 01:00:18.690
Hello, Sam.

01:00:20.595 --> 01:00:24.326
I'm going to have to arrest you
for the murder of Jimmy Nolt.

01:00:24.399 --> 01:00:27.300
Taking yourself kind of serious, ain't you?

01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:31.105
What are you going to do
with that Winchester?

01:00:31.573 --> 01:00:34.542
We're just going to have to find out,
ain't we?

01:00:40.649 --> 01:00:42.446
Yeah, I guess we are.

01:00:43.618 --> 01:00:45.643
I'll take that rifle, Tom.

01:00:51.593 --> 01:00:52.992
Hello, Earl.

01:01:03.438 --> 01:01:05.099
And the belly gun.

01:01:10.145 --> 01:01:11.669
Come on, Tom.

01:01:22.924 --> 01:01:24.858
Wait right there, Tom.

01:01:29.431 --> 01:01:33.231
Don't put that pistol in that drawer.
Keep it in your pocket.

01:01:36.838 --> 01:01:39.363
You got anything in your pockets, Tom?

01:01:39.441 --> 01:01:41.875
I got some Indian stuff here...

01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:45.603
some shells in a sheepskin,
a little bit of change.

01:01:52.621 --> 01:01:53.986
You ready?

01:01:57.759 --> 01:02:00.887
No, upstairs. Bill, you stay down here.

01:02:34.729 --> 01:02:36.959
I'm going to put you in this one.

01:02:37.032 --> 01:02:39.262
I know how you love those hills.

01:02:39.334 --> 01:02:41.859
You can see a little bit of them from here.

01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:46.597
Don't close that door until I get over
to that window, would you?

01:03:20.175 --> 01:03:22.666
Is it true Horn worked for the Association?

01:03:23.511 --> 01:03:24.808
I've nothing to say on that.

01:03:24.879 --> 01:03:27.541
Is the Association going to pay
for his defense?

01:03:27.615 --> 01:03:29.845
I told you, I have no more to say.

01:03:49.804 --> 01:03:51.669
John Coble to see you.

01:03:57.779 --> 01:03:59.713
This is Thomas Burke.

01:03:59.781 --> 01:04:01.942
He'll be your legal counsel now.

01:04:02.617 --> 01:04:03.982
Every boy needs one of those.

01:04:04.052 --> 01:04:07.021
Mr. Burke's the man
to put an end to all this for you.

01:04:07.088 --> 01:04:09.955
- I ain't got no money to pay you.
- I'll pay that.

01:04:10.024 --> 01:04:12.720
They're going to have you
come to court very quickly.

01:04:12.794 --> 01:04:14.762
Have you ever been tried
for anything before?

01:04:14.829 --> 01:04:18.162
Yeah, once.
It was a military trial a long time ago.

01:04:18.566 --> 01:04:21.933
- A couple of scouts and myself.
- What were you charged with?

01:04:22.003 --> 01:04:23.732
Invasion of Mexico.

01:04:25.607 --> 01:04:28.872
Tom, I have to move on with this
as quick as I can.

01:04:29.277 --> 01:04:31.074
You think I killed that boy?

01:04:31.146 --> 01:04:33.171
That question will never come up
between us.

01:04:33.248 --> 01:04:35.978
Why not? It's going to come up in court.

01:04:39.687 --> 01:04:41.018
When do I go to trial?

01:04:41.089 --> 01:04:43.922
They're bringing in a judge
and swearing in a jury right now.

01:04:43.992 --> 01:04:46.460
I'd like to set up a time
we could get together...

01:04:46.528 --> 01:04:48.086
and maybe make a preparation or two.

01:04:48.163 --> 01:04:50.688
What for?
What are we going to talk about...

01:04:50.765 --> 01:04:53.996
if we don't talk about
whether I killed that kid or not?

01:04:54.068 --> 01:04:57.560
Mr. Burke, I'd like to talk to Tom
alone for a minute.

01:05:03.878 --> 01:05:06.438
You ever see so many bars in your life?

01:05:07.949 --> 01:05:10.645
I guess that's why they call it a jail.

01:05:11.619 --> 01:05:14.747
- I've been free all my life, John.
- I know that.

01:05:14.856 --> 01:05:18.417
Look, it's damn important
you don't try to break out of here.

01:05:18.493 --> 01:05:22.725
I know you can do it,
but it's just admitting your guilt if you try.

01:05:24.065 --> 01:05:27.728
Christ, I can see those hills over there,
but I can't touch them.

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.308
Cowboys.

01:05:54.896 --> 01:05:56.295
Schoolteachers.

01:05:59.701 --> 01:06:01.794
You sure are good company.

01:06:04.405 --> 01:06:06.873
Yes, but do you care for me?

01:06:12.247 --> 01:06:13.509
That horse over there...

01:06:13.581 --> 01:06:15.640
is the only thing I've owned
for a long time.

01:06:15.717 --> 01:06:17.651
He thinks the whole world of me...

01:06:17.719 --> 01:06:20.313
and I've never even given him a name.

01:06:20.755 --> 01:06:22.518
Was he good company?

01:06:23.424 --> 01:06:24.516
Yeah.

01:06:24.726 --> 01:06:27.559
- Do you care for him?
- Yes, I do.

01:06:29.898 --> 01:06:31.923
Tom, you're an idiot.

01:06:32.867 --> 01:06:34.858
Yeah, I know.

01:06:44.145 --> 01:06:47.205
- What happened to your tooth there?
- Chipped it.

01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:49.210
How'd you do that?

01:06:49.717 --> 01:06:52.709
Riding horses. I've been riding all my life.

01:07:03.331 --> 01:07:04.628
Get down!

01:07:33.861 --> 01:07:35.260
Get dressed.

01:07:54.782 --> 01:07:58.183
How about giving me back
those Indian charms of mine?

01:08:04.125 --> 01:08:07.060
They're just sentimental value,
nothing more.

01:08:14.202 --> 01:08:18.399
Earl, get Tom's Indian stuff
and bring it up here, will you?

01:08:20.073 --> 01:08:21.541
Anything else you want?

01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:23.941
- Well, my rifle.
- No.

01:08:24.245 --> 01:08:27.009
- How about a nice fast horse?
- No.

01:08:29.350 --> 01:08:32.251
You getting all choky
seeing me behind bars?

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:33.981
God damn you.

01:08:38.626 --> 01:08:40.924
- What are these buttons for?
- Just lucky.

01:08:40.995 --> 01:08:43.622
- The paper said they're charms.
- Yeah, they are.

01:08:43.698 --> 01:08:46.166
- Said you believed in them.
- I do.

01:08:46.234 --> 01:08:48.634
- Show me how they work.
- Someday.

01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:51.136
Who are those fellows out there
with those rifles?

01:08:51.205 --> 01:08:52.569
That's the National Guard.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.575
The paper said they didn't think
we could hold you in jail...

01:08:55.643 --> 01:08:58.339
and they got kind of personal about it.

01:09:18.866 --> 01:09:21.801
Open this thing up, Earl. Let us in.

01:09:24.072 --> 01:09:26.404
John Coble's here to see Tom.

01:09:31.679 --> 01:09:33.237
Here you go.

01:09:33.514 --> 01:09:36.483
John brought you a suit
to wear at the trial.

01:09:39.554 --> 01:09:42.523
All right, you fellows can have
about 10 minutes.

01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:44.189
Come on, Earl.

01:09:47.595 --> 01:09:51.326
It's real important that
you let Burke guide you in court.

01:09:52.433 --> 01:09:56.665
And you be as closed-mouthed as you can
around that prosecuting attorney.

01:09:56.738 --> 01:09:59.229
- Who is he?
- His name's Walter Stoll.

01:10:00.108 --> 01:10:03.874
He is effective.
They say he's running for office again...

01:10:04.612 --> 01:10:07.513
and this trial will be
kind of a showground for him.

01:10:08.349 --> 01:10:11.113
If he convicts you, he'll be a big hero.

01:10:13.154 --> 01:10:15.714
He needs to hang you to get elected.

01:10:19.193 --> 01:10:21.457
I'm sorry I got you into this.

01:10:21.629 --> 01:10:25.463
You could have been riding
right through this two-bit town.

01:10:27.135 --> 01:10:30.832
- People been trying to kill me all my life.
- I've got to tell you something.

01:10:30.905 --> 01:10:33.237
I knew the Association wanted
to get rid of you...

01:10:33.307 --> 01:10:35.172
because they told me.

01:10:35.610 --> 01:10:38.078
But I just didn't know what to do. They...

01:10:39.247 --> 01:10:41.374
I didn't know nothing about...

01:10:41.549 --> 01:10:43.073
the Nolt boy...

01:10:43.651 --> 01:10:45.448
or how it happened, but...

01:10:46.621 --> 01:10:49.419
Who the hell could have done
such a thing?

01:10:51.325 --> 01:10:53.156
But I know one thing.

01:10:53.427 --> 01:10:55.520
You never killed that kid.

01:11:00.501 --> 01:11:04.494
I figure folks would have to do
something about me sooner or later...

01:11:04.572 --> 01:11:06.631
the frontier closed and all.

01:11:07.074 --> 01:11:11.238
I never knew anybody that knew anything
but just killing and getting killed.

01:11:12.847 --> 01:11:15.281
After a while, it's all you know.

01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:19.786
Now listen,
if it all goes wrong in there for me...

01:11:20.655 --> 01:11:22.953
I know you're my friend, John...

01:11:23.691 --> 01:11:26.182
and I know that you care about me.

01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:31.890
Now sit down,
and I'll whip your ass at checkers.

01:12:18.846 --> 01:12:19.835
Good day.

01:12:30.458 --> 01:12:31.948
That's fine, Tom.

01:13:09.230 --> 01:13:12.393
Tom, you can step up
to the counsel's table here.

01:13:13.334 --> 01:13:14.961
Earl, back over here.

01:13:15.136 --> 01:13:16.967
You boys split up.

01:13:18.806 --> 01:13:20.205
The Honorable Judge Scott.

01:13:20.274 --> 01:13:22.469
This court is now in session.

01:13:22.743 --> 01:13:25.234
Mr. Ohnhouse,
you were in the next room at the time...

01:13:25.313 --> 01:13:26.974
under the orders of Marshal Belle...

01:13:27.048 --> 01:13:29.516
and you listened very carefully
to the conversation...

01:13:29.583 --> 01:13:31.983
between Marshal Belle and Mr. Horn.
Is that correct?

01:13:35.289 --> 01:13:36.551
Yes.

01:13:36.924 --> 01:13:40.451
Will you tell the court exactly
what you took down at that time?

01:13:41.095 --> 01:13:44.929
The last thing Mr. Horn said
before leaving Joe Belle's office was:

01:13:45.399 --> 01:13:46.525
"When I shot that kid...

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:48.227
"it was the best shot I ever made...

01:13:48.302 --> 01:13:50.167
"and the dirtiest trick I ever did."

01:13:57.378 --> 01:13:59.676
I want order in this courtroom.

01:13:59.747 --> 01:14:01.214
Your witness.

01:14:01.315 --> 01:14:02.543
No questions.

01:14:02.616 --> 01:14:04.277
You may step down.

01:14:08.389 --> 01:14:10.880
The prosecution calls Mr. Tom Horn.

01:14:21.068 --> 01:14:24.834
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth...

01:14:24.905 --> 01:14:26.532
so help you God?

01:14:26.907 --> 01:14:29.637
Did you listen carefully
to contents of the transcription...

01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:31.974
as read by Mr. Ohnhouse to the court?

01:14:32.813 --> 01:14:33.837
Yes, I did.

01:14:33.914 --> 01:14:38.442
And you understand that this is a record
of your conversation with Marshal Belle?

01:14:38.753 --> 01:14:42.621
Well, it was "Mr. Horn said this"
and "Mr. Belle said that."

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.818
I don't follow.

01:14:46.894 --> 01:14:49.021
What I'm trying to get you to understand...

01:14:49.096 --> 01:14:52.259
is that that was a conversation
between me and Joe Belle.

01:14:53.034 --> 01:14:55.093
I understood that. Do you?

01:14:55.469 --> 01:14:56.800
Yes, I do.

01:14:57.271 --> 01:15:00.866
Do you consider it an accurate
transcription of that conversation?

01:15:00.941 --> 01:15:03.205
You'll have to ask that fellow
that wrote it down.

01:15:03.277 --> 01:15:05.768
I don't know how good he was at it.

01:15:07.214 --> 01:15:09.011
Can you offer us an opinion?

01:15:10.151 --> 01:15:12.517
What did you say your name was?

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:16.083
Walter Stoll.
I'm prosecuting you for murder.

01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:19.655
Well, Mr. Stoll, I was just a little drunk.

01:15:20.528 --> 01:15:21.722
Why?

01:15:22.029 --> 01:15:24.088
Because I'd been drinking.

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.568
What's your problem now?

01:15:31.272 --> 01:15:33.001
I didn't understand you.

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:36.505
We're trying you for murder,
for a capital offense.

01:15:36.811 --> 01:15:40.212
So far, no one has had much success
in getting your attention.

01:15:40.281 --> 01:15:42.943
Well, I've been in jail.

01:15:44.685 --> 01:15:46.448
You've been in jail?

01:15:47.221 --> 01:15:50.190
What has that got to do
with your lackadaisical response...

01:15:50.257 --> 01:15:52.191
to the questions of the court?

01:15:52.293 --> 01:15:53.783
I'm a little bored.

01:15:53.861 --> 01:15:57.194
What Prosecutor Stoll is trying
to apprise you of is that...

01:15:57.264 --> 01:15:59.095
we're trying to decide whether or not...

01:15:59.166 --> 01:16:02.192
you're guilty of a crime
for which you should be hung.

01:16:02.436 --> 01:16:04.961
You're gonna do what you have to do.

01:16:05.473 --> 01:16:08.567
Do you object to the assertion
of Marshal Belle...

01:16:08.642 --> 01:16:10.803
that you killed Jimmy Nolt?

01:16:11.812 --> 01:16:15.111
That was your reply
in the transcribed conversation.

01:16:18.552 --> 01:16:19.814
Mr. Horn?

01:16:21.122 --> 01:16:23.522
Did anybody see me kill that kid?

01:16:24.492 --> 01:16:27.359
There were not, and you know it,
any witnesses.

01:16:27.428 --> 01:16:30.920
I think what the prosecutor is trying
to say to you is that...

01:16:30.998 --> 01:16:33.728
we would keenly like
to have you reply specifically...

01:16:33.801 --> 01:16:36.668
to the accusation that you killed this boy.

01:16:37.438 --> 01:16:40.669
You want me to say
whether I did or I didn't do it?

01:16:40.908 --> 01:16:42.398
In effect, yes...

01:16:42.476 --> 01:16:45.502
although a plea of innocence
has been entered.

01:16:45.646 --> 01:16:49.480
I'm not going to give you the satisfaction.
Now, whether you or Stoll...

01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:52.314
or that sold-out,
son-of-a-bitching marshal Joe Belle...

01:16:52.386 --> 01:16:54.581
want to see me guilty, you go right ahead.

01:16:54.655 --> 01:16:57.852
But I'm not going to give you
any more satisfaction than I have to.

01:16:57.925 --> 01:17:00.393
Whether you shoot me or hang me...

01:17:00.461 --> 01:17:02.793
or take my rifle or my horse...

01:17:03.564 --> 01:17:05.657
one reason is as good as another.

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:09.734
And I believe that, I do.
That's my last word on this matter.

01:17:14.074 --> 01:17:16.167
I want order in this court.

01:17:17.411 --> 01:17:21.142
In the interest of a fair trial,
I'm going to suggest...

01:17:21.882 --> 01:17:25.511
there's something about our proceedings
which seem to elude Mr. Horn here.

01:17:25.586 --> 01:17:27.781
But forgiving, I'm going to suggest...

01:17:27.855 --> 01:17:30.323
that his life
in the lawless parts of our country...

01:17:30.391 --> 01:17:34.418
have left him entirely unfamiliar
with the processes of the law.

01:17:34.695 --> 01:17:36.162
And I strongly suggest...

01:17:36.230 --> 01:17:38.698
that someone who is interested
in his welfare...

01:17:38.766 --> 01:17:40.461
educate him in our ways.

01:17:40.534 --> 01:17:43.025
I'm not sure it is necessary to point out...

01:17:43.103 --> 01:17:45.970
that it is his life which is in question here.

01:17:53.547 --> 01:17:55.481
It's cold in the night.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:10.958
I've been kind of down on my luck lately,
and I want to try to revive it.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.730
This may sound kind of off-center to you...

01:18:15.803 --> 01:18:19.500
but I want to take my Indian charms
and set them under my bunk tonight.

01:18:19.573 --> 01:18:23.270
So when you come in the morning
to give me my breakfast, I'd appreciate it...

01:18:23.344 --> 01:18:25.244
if you didn't look at them.

01:18:25.446 --> 01:18:26.879
I'll probably be asleep...

01:18:26.947 --> 01:18:30.041
because I'll be up
most of the night, thinking.

01:18:30.751 --> 01:18:32.082
Sure, Tom.

01:19:37.584 --> 01:19:39.108
Two bourbons.

01:19:39.186 --> 01:19:41.450
What I'm trying to prove, Philip...

01:19:41.522 --> 01:19:45.652
is that criminals like Tom Horn
are not immune to prosecution.

01:19:46.026 --> 01:19:48.586
The newspapers and the legal profession...

01:19:48.662 --> 01:19:50.892
are going to set things straight
in this country.

01:19:50.964 --> 01:19:53.899
And our system of justice insures that...

01:19:54.234 --> 01:19:58.170
killers like Tom Horn
get exactly what they deserve.

01:19:58.238 --> 01:20:00.502
And I'm going to see that it happens.

01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:50.738
Where are the rifles in here?

01:22:50.811 --> 01:22:53.279
The sheriff said we can't keep them
in here no longer.

01:22:53.347 --> 01:22:54.837
- You got a gun?
- No.

01:22:55.082 --> 01:22:56.845
You going to kill me?

01:22:56.984 --> 01:23:00.920
You and I are walking out of here,
and you're going to smile. Now smile!

01:23:04.992 --> 01:23:06.619
Keep smiling.

01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:08.322
Smile.

01:23:09.596 --> 01:23:12.531
Listen, I've got a.41 caliber in your back.

01:25:38.245 --> 01:25:41.578
You damn fools.
What are you trying to do, kill him?

01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:44.910
Shit.

01:25:45.352 --> 01:25:46.910
You damn fools.

01:25:57.964 --> 01:26:00.398
<i>Has the jury arrived at a verdict?</i>

01:26:00.934 --> 01:26:02.663
<i>Yes, we have, Your Honor.</i>

01:26:02.736 --> 01:26:05.967
<i>The jury finds the defendant,</i>
<i>Tom Horn, guilty.</i>

01:26:06.707 --> 01:26:09.801
<i>The court finds you guilty</i>
<i>of murder as charged.</i>

01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:13.802
<i>You are sentenced to be hanged</i>
<i>by the neck until dead...</i>

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:17.145
<i>between the hours</i>
<i>of 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a. m...</i>

01:26:17.217 --> 01:26:20.584
<i>on November 20, 1903.</i>

01:26:21.321 --> 01:26:23.881
<i>May the Lord have mercy on your soul.</i>

01:26:43.210 --> 01:26:46.839
Someday, you're going to have to pay
for your way of life, Tom.

01:26:47.748 --> 01:26:50.182
You're a bad man and I know it.

01:26:51.151 --> 01:26:54.951
And if I let you talk me out of it,
I'll be lost forever.

01:26:58.592 --> 01:27:01.857
And my adventures in this life
won't mean anything...

01:27:02.329 --> 01:27:05.093
because you will have seduced my soul...

01:27:05.165 --> 01:27:07.065
and drawn me into your world.

01:27:11.138 --> 01:27:12.537
Goodbye, Tom.

01:27:25.585 --> 01:27:27.610
Has his weight been varying much
here in jail?

01:27:27.687 --> 01:27:29.746
I don't believe so.
It's stayed about the same.

01:27:29.823 --> 01:27:32.656
- Do you know how tall he is?
- I ain't sure.

01:27:46.306 --> 01:27:48.103
All right, Tom. Step out.

01:27:52.779 --> 01:27:54.644
Up on the scales.

01:27:57.083 --> 01:27:58.675
What's this for?

01:27:58.985 --> 01:28:01.579
I'm designing your gallows, Mr. Horn.

01:28:01.888 --> 01:28:06.689
I've got to get the weights exactly right.
If this thing works the way I designed it...

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:11.522
you should fall absolutely straight, stop,
and make a half-turn to the right.

01:28:13.166 --> 01:28:15.657
- Will I be alive or dead?
- When?

01:28:16.369 --> 01:28:19.133
When I make that half-turn to the right.

01:28:19.673 --> 01:28:21.436
You should be dead.

01:28:22.008 --> 01:28:24.704
Nobody wants to spring the trap on you.

01:28:25.378 --> 01:28:28.814
Mr. Julian here is designing
something special for us.

01:28:29.416 --> 01:28:31.145
The trap is water operated.

01:28:31.218 --> 01:28:33.482
Christ, you ain't
going to drown me, are you?

01:28:33.553 --> 01:28:36.249
No. You just step onto the platform...

01:28:36.323 --> 01:28:38.348
and your weight will activate
a water valve...

01:28:38.425 --> 01:28:40.655
that finally springs the trap.

01:28:43.163 --> 01:28:45.290
All right, step back inside.

01:28:56.276 --> 01:28:58.471
Do I spring that trap myself?

01:28:59.412 --> 01:29:00.640
Exactly.

01:29:02.048 --> 01:29:04.380
Makes me feel like I'm committing suicide.

01:29:04.451 --> 01:29:07.477
You suppose that's what I've been doing
all these years, Sam?

01:29:07.554 --> 01:29:09.613
Don't ask me that, Tom.

01:29:10.190 --> 01:29:11.657
Bring the scales.

01:29:11.992 --> 01:29:13.755
Come on, Mr. Julian.

01:30:12.585 --> 01:30:14.246
Tom, it's time.

01:30:28.735 --> 01:30:31.135
I'm gonna have to strap you up, Tom.

01:30:53.093 --> 01:30:56.961
Earl, I'm sorry I busted your head
so hard against those bars.

01:30:59.332 --> 01:31:01.095
That's all right, Tom.

01:31:03.670 --> 01:31:05.968
This is Father J. P. Rank.

01:31:06.973 --> 01:31:09.771
- How do you do?
- Fine, Tom. You?

01:31:13.913 --> 01:31:17.144
- How long you had that Bible?
- Twenty-eight years.

01:31:18.618 --> 01:31:20.813
Got her about bucked out yet?

01:31:21.221 --> 01:31:22.813
I think so.

01:31:26.359 --> 01:31:28.623
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:31:58.091 --> 01:32:01.959
- I understand you're getting married, son.
- Yes, I am, Mr. Horn.

01:32:02.028 --> 01:32:04.326
You take good care of her, now.

01:32:12.539 --> 01:32:14.166
Right there, Tom.

01:33:03.256 --> 01:33:06.419
Keep your nerve, Sam,
because I'm going to keep mine.

01:33:39.159 --> 01:33:41.787
All right. Tom, step back on the trap.

01:33:50.036 --> 01:33:51.230
There.

01:34:36.282 --> 01:34:37.749
Sam, I've never seen...

01:34:37.817 --> 01:34:40.581
such a pasty-faced bunch of sheriffs
in my life.
