00:23.065 --> 00:26.860
<i>I'm a big adrenaline junkie.
I enjoy the rush.</i>

00:27.653 --> 00:30.030
<i>A supercar is ultra-high performance.</i>

00:30.113 --> 00:32.950
<i>A sleeper, it's gonna get its ass kicked.</i>

00:34.701 --> 00:37.371
<i>I built this sleeper in my garage.</i>

00:38.664 --> 00:42.209
Supercar guys just went to the dealership
and bought a fancy car.

00:45.337 --> 00:48.215
<i>This Odyssey is the perfect sleeper
because it looks like</i>

00:48.298 --> 00:49.716
<i>it can't do much of anything.</i>

00:51.426 --> 00:53.303
<i>We've actually made minivans sexy.</i>

00:56.890 --> 00:59.768
<i>Supercars are built
by a bunch of engineers.</i>

01:02.020 --> 01:04.730
<i>With this sleeper car, it's just me
and my dad.</i>

01:08.485 --> 01:10.654
<i>You're making decisions</i>

01:10.779 --> 01:13.365
<i>within, you know,
hundredths of milliseconds</i>

01:13.448 --> 01:17.452
<i>and then those decisions ultimately can be
catastrophic if you make the wrong ones.</i>

01:22.165 --> 01:26.503
<i>There is four really, really fast cars
racing at incredible speeds,</i>

01:26.628 --> 01:29.756
<i>inches away from each other,
all fighting for position.</i>

01:31.717 --> 01:34.177
<i>When I'm ready to race,
I'm in the zone.</i>

01:34.803 --> 01:38.348
<i>Nothing matters. I visualize the win,
I get the win.</i>

01:38.849 --> 01:41.393
<i>It's a quarter-mile race.
People look at my truck</i>

01:41.476 --> 01:44.479
<i>and assume that
it's not gonna be that fast,</i>

01:44.730 --> 01:46.898
<i>but I'll turn the nitrous on and destroy.</i>

01:48.567 --> 01:51.945
The winner of this race will go
on to the championship race

01:52.237 --> 01:54.239
<i>in El Mirage Dry Lake Bed.</i>

01:55.157 --> 01:58.869
<i>I've got to win. I wanna win.
I need to beat that person. I need to win.</i>

01:59.911 --> 02:02.039
<i>It's gonna be insanity
no matter what.</i>

02:19.181 --> 02:22.434
<i>My name is Corey Caouette.
I'm from Huntington Beach, California.</i>

02:24.561 --> 02:27.189
<i>I drive this thing everywhere.</i>

02:28.899 --> 02:33.153
<i>I'm proud to have this thing on the road
next to just regular old cars.</i>

02:35.572 --> 02:37.407
<i>The name of my car is Lunch Money.</i>

02:37.699 --> 02:41.286
<i>The name Lunch Money came from,
like when you're back in junior high</i>

02:41.411 --> 02:45.999
<i>and you're saving as much money as you can
to build something on a budget,</i>

02:46.124 --> 02:49.419
<i>and compete against things that are worth
a ton of money.</i>

02:49.836 --> 02:53.423
<i>People are shocked when they know
it can go over 150 miles an hour.</i>

02:56.176 --> 02:58.470
I put a lot of work and...

02:59.096 --> 03:01.473
pretty much blood, sweat
and tears into this.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.226
<i>It's when I'm driving this car it's...</i>

03:04.351 --> 03:08.105
It's like I'm a hundred percent... normal.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.273
Just doing what I love to do.

03:15.654 --> 03:18.240
<i>Growing up in Huntington Beach,
I surfed a lot,</i>

03:18.448 --> 03:20.951
<i>but I skated and road bikes even more.</i>

03:21.410 --> 03:25.414
<i>You would catch me there
pretty much every day after school.</i>

03:25.622 --> 03:28.834
<i>If I wasn't doing that,
I was at the skate park, skating.</i>

03:31.461 --> 03:36.049
<i>I never broke a bone in my body...
until my accident.</i>

03:38.510 --> 03:41.012
<i>2007, I'm out of high school,</i>

03:41.138 --> 03:44.349
<i>I'm 21 years old, you know,
I was in my prime.</i>

03:45.559 --> 03:48.145
<i>We're hanging out and I take a phone call,</i>

03:48.353 --> 03:51.773
<i>so I stepped out to a hallway
with a handrail,</i>

03:51.982 --> 03:56.027
<i>leaning over the handrail...
and woke up in ICU.</i>

03:58.739 --> 04:01.283
I looked over and somebody said,
"You fell from very high up."

04:01.908 --> 04:05.287
And I looked down and I felt
I was like, "I'm paralyzed."

04:11.209 --> 04:14.379
<i>I had complete
spinal cord injury T5.</i>

04:14.546 --> 04:17.757
<i>I had broken all my ribs,
I collapsed both of my lungs,</i>

04:17.923 --> 04:20.218
<i>I broke my collar bone
and my shoulder blade.</i>

04:20.886 --> 04:23.847
<i>Two months later,
they let me start rehab.</i>

04:23.972 --> 04:25.974
<i>Learning how to get around
in a wheelchair,</i>

04:26.057 --> 04:28.518
<i>learning how to shower.</i>

04:28.810 --> 04:30.061
<i>That stuff is difficult.</i>

04:30.228 --> 04:32.981
<i>Balance is a huge thing
and I worked on that for a long time,</i>

04:33.064 --> 04:36.067
<i>just sitting on a flat surface,
holding my arms out,</i>

04:36.151 --> 04:38.820
<i>and trying to keep myself
from falling over.</i>

04:39.029 --> 04:42.908
<i>Driving a car, I thought
it was gonna be impossible forever.</i>

04:44.618 --> 04:47.871
<i>Two, three years after
my accident, I was really bored.</i>

04:47.954 --> 04:50.040
<i>I needed something to do.</i>

04:50.332 --> 04:53.418
<i>So, I bought the cab.
It had the big giant doors,</i>

04:53.710 --> 04:56.588
<i>it was perfect for me transferring
in in my wheelchair.</i>

04:56.922 --> 04:58.006
I had to have it.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.593
<i>The cab is a 1927 Dodge 3-Window Coupe.</i>

05:01.843 --> 05:05.222
<i>The bed is a 1935 bed cut down.</i>

05:05.514 --> 05:10.018
<i>The engine is out of a 2002 Corvette
with all the fuel injection</i>

05:10.101 --> 05:13.396
<i>and there's about 20 different vehicles
in this car.</i>

05:13.480 --> 05:18.318
<i>The first version took nine months
from start to driving.</i>

05:24.366 --> 05:26.785
When I designed this hand controller
right here,

05:26.993 --> 05:30.288
I was thinking what was gonna be
the most comfortable for me to use.

05:30.372 --> 05:35.168
With me not having abdominal muscles
to hold myself up, really,

05:35.252 --> 05:38.505
I decided that pushing forward
is obviously gonna push my body

05:38.713 --> 05:42.300
back into the seat.
And as far as the throttle,

05:42.509 --> 05:45.095
it's just as simple as pulling a lever.

05:56.314 --> 06:00.402
<i>Driving it for the first time,
I was definitely proud of the fact</i>

06:00.485 --> 06:02.988
<i>that I built it myself in my garage.</i>

06:04.072 --> 06:07.576
<i>I think my whole life, I've always
wanted to drive something that,</i>

06:07.659 --> 06:11.746
<i>you know, screams "Look at me,"
but is cool.</i>

06:14.207 --> 06:17.627
<i>It was freedom. It was
just a total independence.</i>

06:17.836 --> 06:20.505
<i>I'm going and doing things
that I wanted to do</i>

06:20.589 --> 06:24.301
<i>and not having to ask somebody
for a ride and you get sick of it.</i>

06:24.384 --> 06:26.553
<i>You don't wanna rely on people
for anything.</i>

06:28.221 --> 06:31.725
<i>This race is important to me
because I just wanna prove that experience</i>

06:31.808 --> 06:33.393
<i>beats a pocket full of cash.</i>

06:43.820 --> 06:46.406
<i>My name is Hannah Maloof
and I am 19 years old.</i>

06:47.824 --> 06:51.995
<i>I wouldn't say I'm girly at all.
I barely do my makeup.</i>

06:53.955 --> 06:56.124
<i>I always put my all into everything,</i>

06:56.249 --> 06:58.251
<i>a hundred and ten percent
into everything I do.</i>

06:59.628 --> 07:02.881
<i>I just love racing, I love going fast,
I love the adrenaline. I love...</i>

07:03.298 --> 07:04.925
<i>building the car and the engine.</i>

07:06.593 --> 07:10.639
I like naturally aspirated.
Like no turbos, no nitrous.

07:10.722 --> 07:14.434
I like to pull as much horsepower as I can
out of the engine and get it done.

07:15.268 --> 07:19.648
I don't use nitrous. I think nitrous is,
you know, bottles are for babies so...

07:23.735 --> 07:26.947
<i>I've never been nervous around cars.
I grew up in it.</i>

07:27.489 --> 07:30.909
<i>My dad is Sammy Maloof, he's a stuntman...</i>

07:32.535 --> 07:35.080
<i>...and he builds racing engines
and owns a shop</i>

07:35.205 --> 07:37.332
<i>and has been racing his whole life.</i>

07:41.086 --> 07:45.548
<i>My dad is one of the best.
I couldn't have asked for a better dad.</i>

07:48.301 --> 07:51.513
I'm a Hollywood stuntman.
Vehicular stunts is my specialty.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.557
It's a nature to me.
It's not second nature, it's my nature.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.685
<i>It's what I eat, drink, breath, and sleep.</i>

07:59.020 --> 08:02.941
I didn't just grow up
around quiet, everyday cars,

08:03.024 --> 08:06.903
I grew up around loud muscle cars.
You know, fast cars.

08:08.154 --> 08:11.574
Here we go, hold it up. More, more, more.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.369
More, more. More, more.

08:18.081 --> 08:21.251
<i>My dad has been training me
in precision driving. Stunts.</i>

08:22.127 --> 08:25.255
<i>My first race, I was 16.
I had just got my license.</i>

08:29.676 --> 08:33.013
I'm not good with the whole school thing.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.639
<i>I was home-schooled.</i>

08:34.806 --> 08:37.808
<i>I've learned so much more being here
than I do at a school,</i>

08:37.933 --> 08:40.562
because at a school,
you're not really learning anything.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.313
- That one? Wait.
- No, it's too big. Way too big.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.838
- What size is that?
- Just give me a crescent wrench.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.362
<i>When you send kids to schools,</i>

08:49.446 --> 08:52.407
and this is not knocking a school,
this is just me.

08:52.574 --> 08:56.870
You got 700 kids... training their kids.

08:56.953 --> 09:00.123
They're gonna teach them how to lie.
They're gonna teach them how to steal.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.751
Go in my engine room
and get my box of fittings.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.962
Where's those wrenches?

09:07.005 --> 09:09.883
<i>I have three daughters,
and they are so mechanically inclined.</i>

09:11.259 --> 09:13.553
Go get four shorties that'll go in here.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.389
<i>I went to college for two weeks.</i>

09:16.723 --> 09:19.434
<i>I listened to a teacher
making 36 grand a year.</i>

09:19.976 --> 09:24.481
I made more than him in one month
in illegal street racing

09:24.689 --> 09:26.399
<i>than he did all year.</i>

09:28.735 --> 09:33.406
<i>Every day, Hannah is building
racing engines with me.</i>

09:35.283 --> 09:37.494
<i>I love being here.
I love the shop.</i>

09:38.661 --> 09:41.873
<i>Eventually, when I get older,
I'm gonna take over the shop.</i>

09:44.125 --> 09:48.004
<i>Then I'm gonna be racing
in my dad's 1964 Chevy Pickup Truck.</i>

09:48.546 --> 09:51.382
<i>It's got one of my dad's engines in it,
so it's definitely a sleeper.</i>

09:51.591 --> 09:52.926
<i>This was his first car.</i>

09:53.176 --> 09:56.096
<i>When I was 15, I wanted to get
into street racing</i>

09:56.262 --> 09:58.139
<i>because that's what I wanted,
to make my money.</i>

09:58.598 --> 10:01.601
<i>Most of the time, they're gonna look
at this brick and they're gonna say,</i>

10:01.684 --> 10:03.728
<i>"How is this thing gonna ever run
against the car?"</i>

10:04.437 --> 10:06.940
<i>I never lost a race in my pickup.</i>

10:07.565 --> 10:09.651
<i>I'm super-excited
to race a supercar.</i>

10:10.235 --> 10:12.403
<i>That's really cool
and it's really exciting.</i>

10:20.620 --> 10:22.372
<i>My name is Bisi Ezerioha.</i>

10:22.956 --> 10:24.958
<i>I was actually born in Lynwood,
California,</i>

10:25.166 --> 10:27.168
<i>but I went to Nigeria
when I was very young,</i>

10:27.252 --> 10:29.254
<i>and I spent a majority of my life there.</i>

10:29.629 --> 10:34.050
But came here to United States really
to pursue my passion with engineering.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.095
<i>My dad was a geologist
and my mom was a biochemist</i>

10:37.178 --> 10:40.098
<i>who's brilliant, by the way,
and was a big influence on me.</i>

10:40.306 --> 10:44.060
But the entire time I was in school,
I did something quite naughty.

10:44.561 --> 10:45.645
I got into street racing.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.107
<i>It was a really good way to make money.</i>

10:49.315 --> 10:51.776
<i>The best night I had was a $5,000 pot.</i>

10:51.901 --> 10:53.862
<i>After that, I was hooked.</i>

10:54.946 --> 10:57.157
<i>After graduating from university,
I was doing very well,</i>

10:57.448 --> 10:59.051
<i>making six figures
in pharmaceutical sales.</i>

10:59.075 --> 11:01.327
But the whole time I was
in pharma, I raced.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.414
I raced, and raced, and raced.

11:06.207 --> 11:09.669
And then this other side of my business
started picking up very nicely on the side

11:09.752 --> 11:12.797
where I go to track and people kept
approaching me to make things for them.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.562
<i>Well, it started
becoming quite lucrative,</i>

11:14.883 --> 11:18.678
but I don't have the balls to just leave
this six-figure comfortable job.

11:19.429 --> 11:23.474
- And then here comes Hedi.
<i>- I was a pre-med major at USC.</i>

11:24.142 --> 11:26.936
He comes up to me and he goes,
"Are you courting anyone?"

11:27.270 --> 11:30.940
And I was like, "Whoa, this is like
Gaelic English or something."

11:31.024 --> 11:35.028
<i>We both have engineering
and chemistry type of backgrounds.</i>

11:35.111 --> 11:37.113
<i>We are both very technical.</i>

11:37.197 --> 11:39.037
<i>She comes from a family
of entrepreneurs</i>

11:39.282 --> 11:42.493
<i>and watched me for a long time
and says, "Bisi, you need to do this."</i>

11:42.911 --> 11:45.580
<i>She really pushed me to work on cars,</i>

11:45.830 --> 11:48.374
<i>and now I'm the owner and founder
of Bisimoto Engineering.</i>

11:48.958 --> 11:51.398
We take these cars that you
would never expect to be exciting,

11:51.669 --> 11:53.046
and we make them exciting.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.507
<i>I really enjoy what I do,
but it is a balancing act.</i>

11:56.674 --> 11:59.886
<i>If I spend all my time on my business,
my family life will suffer.</i>

12:00.053 --> 12:01.739
My wife and I after getting married
didn't even...

12:01.763 --> 12:03.973
we've not gone on our honeymoon yet.
We constantly work.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.517
<i>It's one of our biggest
hurdles, I think.</i>

12:06.601 --> 12:10.688
<i>There's so many fears of, like, failure,
not being able to make ends meet,</i>

12:10.813 --> 12:14.400
or what could happen if the business
didn't go as planned.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.195
Hi, Akira.

12:17.362 --> 12:20.531
<i>When Akira was born, it changed
significantly my outlook on life.</i>

12:21.324 --> 12:25.453
<i>That's what got me into building minivans.
Because I love speed...</i>

12:26.996 --> 12:30.416
<i>but I have a growing family. So how
could I eat my cake and have it, too?</i>

12:30.959 --> 12:33.920
I know. Let's build this van.
It will just be a fun project.

12:35.171 --> 12:39.842
<i>It's not a bright red, or menacing black,
or... or canary yellow.</i>

12:40.051 --> 12:41.636
It's burgundy.

12:42.011 --> 12:45.223
You can't get any more
bland... than burgundy.

12:47.642 --> 12:49.435
<i>This Odyssey is the perfect sleeper</i>

12:49.602 --> 12:51.854
because it looks like
it can't do much of anything.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.774
<i>1029 is the official horsepower rating</i>

12:54.983 --> 12:57.568
<i>for this 2014 Bisimoto Odyssey.</i>

12:57.735 --> 13:00.071
- What's the unofficial?
- I can't say.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.490
<i>Quite a bit more than that.</i>

13:04.242 --> 13:06.744
<i>I'm severely underestimated in my racing,</i>

13:07.370 --> 13:09.122
and upon launch I'm left,

13:09.372 --> 13:12.041
and then by the time I hit third gear,
I'm right there,

13:12.166 --> 13:14.502
<i>and by the time I'm fourth and fifth,
I'm passing everyone.</i>

13:15.253 --> 13:18.298
I am... accustomed to winning.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.174
<i>I'm very proud of my accomplishments.</i>

13:20.425 --> 13:22.677
<i>If you go to my office, you'll see tons
of trophies.</i>

13:23.094 --> 13:24.304
Street cred...

13:25.888 --> 13:28.641
is very important. I have a lot at stake
here. I mean,

13:28.891 --> 13:30.651
the whole world will see
what's gonna happen.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.729
<i>Your credibility is everything.</i>

13:33.479 --> 13:36.149
<i>I wanna come out the victor
and really make people feel</i>

13:36.232 --> 13:39.277
the power of this Odyssey. Then the next
time, they hear the word Bisimoto...

13:40.069 --> 13:42.447
they'll think twice before trying
to line-up with him.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.501
<i>My name is Erik Davis.</i>

13:55.585 --> 13:57.920
<i>E-R-I-K. The Viking spelling.</i>

13:59.213 --> 14:01.591
<i>I'm pretty intense, competitive,</i>

14:01.758 --> 14:04.761
<i>loyal, hardworking,
probably work too much.</i>

14:05.803 --> 14:08.097
<i>It's how... how I've been
since I was a kid.</i>

14:08.723 --> 14:11.392
<i>You know, it's about getting shit done
and winning it.</i>

14:15.938 --> 14:18.358
<i>Growing up, I was the third son,</i>

14:18.483 --> 14:21.110
<i>so I think to a certain extent,
I got away with murder.</i>

14:24.322 --> 14:27.033
<i>As a kid, we had horses and motorcycles</i>

14:27.200 --> 14:30.161
and we didn't really have
any money growing up

14:30.244 --> 14:31.579
but I didn't know that, you know,

14:31.662 --> 14:33.422
we always had everything
that we ever needed.

14:34.457 --> 14:37.210
<i>My father always had a project car.</i>

14:37.585 --> 14:41.339
<i>Some of my youngest memories
ultimately are revolving around cars</i>

14:41.422 --> 14:43.049
<i>in one form or another.</i>

14:43.383 --> 14:46.844
What's the... what's the rate?
So, it's aggressive.

14:47.512 --> 14:51.641
<i>So, I raced, you know, BMX, motocross,
played all different kinds of sports,</i>

14:52.016 --> 14:54.727
<i>but the thought of serving my country
was appealing to me,</i>

14:54.811 --> 14:57.271
<i>and ultimately went to the Air Force
Academy to play football.</i>

14:57.438 --> 15:01.526
<i>So, I served six years in the Air Force.
My degree was in finance.</i>

15:02.151 --> 15:04.821
<i>And now, today, I'm involved
in a variety of businesses.</i>

15:05.029 --> 15:09.992
I understand but can't... can't you
just update that and it's active?

15:10.952 --> 15:14.497
<i>I don't buy cars specifically because
other people think they're collectible.</i>

15:14.664 --> 15:17.625
<i>I buy them because they're special
to me for one reason or another.</i>

15:17.875 --> 15:20.336
You know, like... like, this car
is a good example.

15:20.545 --> 15:23.047
This is my 1970 Hemi Cuda.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.884
It's got a Keith Black 540
all-aluminum Hemi motor in it,

15:27.051 --> 15:29.345
about 700 Horsepower naturally aspirated.

15:29.470 --> 15:33.057
Car's kind of become a little bit famous,
I guess.

15:33.141 --> 15:37.103
It was in <i>Fast and the Furious
6 </i> and <i>7.</i>

15:37.562 --> 15:39.147
<i>My friend Paul Walker,</i>

15:39.230 --> 15:41.816
<i>and another good buddy of mine,
Roger Rodas,</i>

15:41.941 --> 15:46.821
we all ultimately met around the car world
and motorsports etcetera.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.948
<i>It was really how it's involvement
was born,</i>

15:49.407 --> 15:53.536
<i>through Paul and his involvement
in the </i> Fast and the Furious <i>franchise.</i>

15:54.078 --> 15:56.414
<i>Our mission was to have a lot of fun.</i>

15:56.497 --> 16:00.084
<i>Race cars, collect cars, kind of pursue
the passion of automotive.</i>

16:00.418 --> 16:02.628
<i>We did a lot of buying
and selling of cars.</i>

16:02.753 --> 16:04.797
I think between the three of us
at one point

16:04.881 --> 16:07.258
we had 120-plus cars
or something like that.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.501
It was a little... it was getting
a little out of hand.

16:09.552 --> 16:12.555
<i>So, the car we're gonna be using
out of my collection for this</i>

16:13.181 --> 16:15.016
<i>is a 2006 Ford GT.</i>

16:15.099 --> 16:17.185
<i>A lot of people don't even know
the car exists.</i>

16:18.060 --> 16:20.521
<i>Back in the early 60s,</i>

16:21.022 --> 16:23.399
<i>Henry Ford told his engineers...</i>

16:23.983 --> 16:26.110
<i>...to beat Ferrari at Le Mans.</i>

16:26.819 --> 16:29.614
<i>So, they proceeded to go and... and bring
in a lot of talent,</i>

16:29.697 --> 16:31.449
<i>including Carroll Shelby.</i>

16:31.657 --> 16:33.784
<i>And out of that was born the GT40.</i>

16:35.077 --> 16:38.873
<i>That car went to Le Mans in 1966.</i>

16:43.878 --> 16:47.965
<i>They put three cars on the track
and it took first, second and third.</i>

16:49.008 --> 16:51.469
<i>One, two, three on the podium
at the end of the race...</i>

16:52.512 --> 16:55.056
<i>which was a very historic event,
obviously,</i>

16:55.223 --> 16:57.934
<i>for an American-made factory
to go in there and do that.</i>

16:58.142 --> 17:01.187
<i>So, 40 years later in commemoration
of that great event,</i>

17:01.312 --> 17:04.941
<i>Ford elected to build
the limited production of these cars.</i>

17:12.448 --> 17:16.117
<i>The sound of a small block
Coyote motor,</i>

17:16.243 --> 17:20.373
it's just... I don't know. I think it's one
of the best sounds when you open it up.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.333
<i>It just barks, you know.</i>

17:22.833 --> 17:24.627
<i>It's not the quietest car.</i>

17:28.089 --> 17:31.384
<i>Racing a Ford GT against sleeper cars</i>

17:31.551 --> 17:33.219
<i>is something that I've never done before.</i>

17:33.970 --> 17:37.098
<i>Looking forward to seeing the results
and having some fun with it.</i>

17:46.899 --> 17:48.276
Hmm. Spider.

17:48.943 --> 17:52.613
<i>Me and Amber met 2011.</i>

17:53.239 --> 17:55.908
<i>She's always taking care of me.</i>

17:55.992 --> 17:57.827
You got it? You do.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.413
<i>We do everything together.</i>

18:00.496 --> 18:04.917
<i>I mean, if it's going to a racetrack
on a miserable, hot day,</i>

18:05.001 --> 18:06.961
<i>if I'm going, she'll go.</i>

18:08.254 --> 18:13.092
<i>It's not your typical "girlfriend
kind of has her girly things..."</i>

18:13.843 --> 18:18.222
<i>We both enjoy what we do
and we do it together.</i>

18:18.306 --> 18:20.725
- You got it?
- Yeah. It's going.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.187
Oh, my fingers. You got them.

18:25.354 --> 18:29.275
<i>Me and Rob, our stories
are very similar. Just everything.</i>

18:29.358 --> 18:32.028
<i>I mean, we're like the same age,
same hobbies.</i>

18:32.278 --> 18:34.113
<i>He's also in a wheelchair.</i>

18:34.739 --> 18:38.117
I seen he had a sick-ass truck
with cool hand controls,

18:38.326 --> 18:41.329
an LS, and the thing was fast
and he built it all himself,

18:41.495 --> 18:44.415
which was the exact same way
I did my build.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.834
No, we're doing good.
Halfway done.

18:48.085 --> 18:51.088
So, you find a good dude in a chair
and you're all got similar interests

18:51.172 --> 18:52.757
and stuff, you know, it's pretty tight.

18:54.425 --> 18:56.761
Do you actually know
who you're racing?

18:56.969 --> 18:59.096
I just found out it's a Ford GT.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.349
- Ford GT?
- Yeah.

19:01.724 --> 19:04.685
I don't even know what a Ford GT
really does.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.896
I mean, I know it's a V8
with a supercharger, so...

19:06.979 --> 19:09.774
Yeah. I think you're gonna kick its ass.
That's probably what I think

19:10.066 --> 19:11.525
- Let's see.
- ...with this thing.

19:12.234 --> 19:15.321
- A 2006...
- 2006 Ford GT...

19:15.946 --> 19:18.407
Well, they're a $139,000.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.035
- Yup.
- It's a 5.4-liter V8.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.163
550 horsepower.

19:24.246 --> 19:28.042
You got just damn near
as much horsepower with nitrous.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.795
Three thousand, four hundred
and eighty-five pounds.

19:31.212 --> 19:34.674
So, he is pretty much on point,
a thousand pounds heavier than me.

19:34.840 --> 19:39.804
And I pooped today, so that's like another
five pounds right there, dropping weight.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.680
I'm a jockey.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.742
<i>Who you gonna
be racing, Hannah?</i>

19:45.768 --> 19:47.144
<i>What do you think?</i>

19:47.269 --> 19:48.562
- A Hellcat?
- No.

19:48.646 --> 19:51.232
- Demon? Porsche?
- No.

19:51.649 --> 19:54.068
- McLaren? Lamborghini?
- No.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.488
You're not talking about the Mustang GT
or the Mustang...

19:57.571 --> 20:00.449
It's not a Mustang. It is Ford.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.161
- It's a Ford GT.
- Like the GT40?

20:04.245 --> 20:07.873
- Yeah, yeah.
- Interesting. Interesting.

20:08.165 --> 20:11.877
So, we have to get a few things set up.
We got to finish the cell in it.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.921
Finish the tune-up on it.

20:14.255 --> 20:17.258
Set the suspension and you'll be good,
pumpkin. You worried?

20:17.591 --> 20:19.009
- No.
- I know you're not.

20:20.970 --> 20:21.971
There we go.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.098
Do I have
the whole thing by myself?

20:25.391 --> 20:27.143
I got to run a fuel line.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.776
- Get that.
- And it's snug.

20:39.363 --> 20:42.032
Give me a 5/8ths wrench
and an 11/16ths.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.411
What do we know about this car?
What do we know about the '06?

20:45.494 --> 20:48.831
It runs, I believe, 11.2 in a quarter-mile
at 134.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.667
Really? That's pretty decent.
That's decent for older car.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.670
It's pretty good traction,
zero to 60 is 3.3,

20:54.837 --> 20:56.839
a 3.5 depending, like, as well.

20:56.964 --> 21:00.176
And 550 horse power,
500-pound feet of torque,

21:00.551 --> 21:03.262
and 3500 pounds so, it's pretty light car.

21:03.345 --> 21:07.767
Wow. So, it has almost 2000 pounds
in its favor compared to us.

21:08.309 --> 21:11.061
My goal is to take off the street tires,
change plu... spark plugs,

21:11.145 --> 21:13.272
putting fresh oil in, drain the 91-octane,

21:13.355 --> 21:15.524
put in the 85.
I'm not gonna make it easy for them.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.402
I have a 40 here, I have a front here.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.364
Wow, this is heavy.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.743
These tires are a lot more stickier
than the street ones.

21:26.076 --> 21:29.246
So even though it gives us a higher
potential to destroy the gear box,

21:29.580 --> 21:31.707
it's gonna allow us to accelerate
a lot faster.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.799
<i>He's very
focused, determined.</i>

21:39.924 --> 21:42.927
<i>The thing with him,
he really is a mad scientist.</i>

21:43.260 --> 21:45.679
Well, we need
to lighten this thing up.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.015
- Flip from here, right?
- I am not sure.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.768
- There we go.
- How heavy is that?

21:51.519 --> 21:53.479
- You guys got it?
- Okay. Where's it going?

21:54.814 --> 21:56.273
Are you nervous, Bisi?

21:56.357 --> 21:59.318
- I'm excited. I'm not nervous.
- Are you really? You're such an optimist.

21:59.401 --> 22:02.822
If he does get beat by a minivan,
that would be kind of embarrassing.

22:03.531 --> 22:05.175
What are you doing,
just sitting there?

22:05.199 --> 22:07.993
I'm doing the most important thing,
which is notes.

22:16.585 --> 22:17.878
<i>When I go into a race,</i>

22:18.170 --> 22:20.047
<i>obviously, I try to be
as prepared as I can be,</i>

22:20.172 --> 22:23.717
<i>but in the last few years,
I've been racing less than I'd like to.</i>

22:24.426 --> 22:27.429
<i>In 2013, we were having an event,</i>

22:27.513 --> 22:30.474
<i>actually out of the shop in Valencia,</i>

22:30.558 --> 22:32.685
and unfortunately, that was the day

22:32.852 --> 22:36.146
that Roger and Paul were killed.

22:36.397 --> 22:39.692
<i>Paul Walker, actor,
heart-throb and car enthusiast,</i>

22:39.775 --> 22:43.737
<i>killed this afternoon when he and a friend
were going for a ride in a sports car</i>

22:43.821 --> 22:46.657
<i>which crashed into a tree
and burst into flames.</i>

22:52.079 --> 22:56.208
Yeah, I was... I was the first one
to arrive on the scene

22:56.292 --> 22:59.003
when Roger and Paul crashed. So...

23:00.045 --> 23:01.839
so, yeah, I remember it very vividly.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.428
<i>The car that crashed today,
a Porsche Carrera GT,</i>

23:07.511 --> 23:10.014
<i>belonged to the owner
of a high-end racing shop</i>

23:10.097 --> 23:12.057
<i>located around the corner
from the crash.</i>

23:12.725 --> 23:16.186
<i>I've had other experiences
in my life that have been pretty gnarly.</i>

23:16.270 --> 23:18.188
<i>That one was just so close to home.</i>

23:19.106 --> 23:22.067
I was always the risk taker.
Those guys weren't, by the way. I was.

23:22.151 --> 23:26.322
So, I was... you know, driving too fast
and going into canyons

23:26.405 --> 23:29.158
and doing all the stuff
that I probably shouldn't have been doing.

23:29.241 --> 23:32.286
So, it puts a lot of things in perspective

23:32.703 --> 23:34.788
when you lose friends like that.

23:35.122 --> 23:38.709
It was a... life-changing event for me.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.005
<i>Racing's dangerous.</i>

23:44.256 --> 23:46.467
<i>When you're racing,
particularly in close quarters,</i>

23:46.759 --> 23:50.930
<i>in this case, a drag race,
a lot of different things can go wrong.</i>

23:52.890 --> 23:55.184
<i>It's part of racing
and ultimately something</i>

23:55.267 --> 23:56.852
<i>that you got to be prepared for.</i>

24:02.816 --> 24:04.109
Let me see Hannah.

24:06.278 --> 24:09.406
- Either one... either one is okay.
- Okay. Get in the truck a minute.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.867
Hold on.
Where are you gonna sit?

24:12.534 --> 24:13.619
Put this right here.

24:14.036 --> 24:15.972
- <i>When something goes wrong...</i>
- This like this.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.040
<i>...you only have one chance
to collect yourself.</i>

24:18.415 --> 24:21.418
<i>And sometimes, that chance
turns into a half a chance.</i>

24:21.502 --> 24:24.338
Here... which goes like this.

24:24.463 --> 24:28.509
<i>And I've trained her in safety,
but she needs to be on her game.</i>

24:29.176 --> 24:32.346
Let me... let me have... Wait, wait...
Whoa, whoa, what, give me that.

24:33.097 --> 24:34.977
Where's the... where's the bracket
for that one?

24:35.057 --> 24:37.309
Safety first with me.
There's a 4,000-pound car...

24:38.352 --> 24:39.603
that's a piece of iron.

24:40.688 --> 24:41.688
Like this.

24:42.064 --> 24:43.816
<i>There is no room for error.</i>

24:50.489 --> 24:54.326
<i>My strengths would be, basically,
horsepower to weight...</i>

24:54.910 --> 24:57.079
<i>the fact that I'm on nitrous.</i>

24:57.162 --> 25:01.667
<i>The nitrous gives me way more horsepower
and we're gonna be moving.</i>

25:01.750 --> 25:04.003
<i>So, I'm gonna have to come
in a little soft.</i>

25:04.795 --> 25:07.673
<i>Right when we leave, it'll be
not even springing any nitrous,</i>

25:07.881 --> 25:11.010
on full throttle and then probably
within like three seconds,

25:11.093 --> 25:14.263
is you're gonna start progressively
springing all the way up to 150.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.265
Are you scared about the 150 shot?

25:17.391 --> 25:19.560
- I am.
- You are? Why?

25:20.060 --> 25:23.355
- We've never done over a hundred.
- We'll keep the wheels on it.

25:23.439 --> 25:27.192
My whole goal was to have the front end
done before we did anything over 100.

25:27.526 --> 25:32.406
Just to make sure nothing comes loose
going that fast, that quick, you know?

25:32.990 --> 25:34.783
- Yeah.
- She's paranoid.

25:35.159 --> 25:38.120
I... well, yeah, I love the truck, okay.

25:38.328 --> 25:40.330
- Oh, you love the truck.
- It's the truck.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.124
Yeah.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.918
No. I'd like to keep Corey around
a little bit longer.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.671
We'll have to do a test run tonight.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.144
<i>So, coming from
a family of scientists</i>

25:54.219 --> 25:55.971
<i>has its perks,
because I look at data.</i>

25:56.055 --> 25:59.892
<i>I'm very data-driven,
and use that data to my advantage.</i>

26:01.769 --> 26:04.396
<i>When it comes to technology,
that's really where I shine.</i>

26:07.232 --> 26:09.276
So, this is my volumetric efficiency map.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.279
This determines the volumetric efficiency
of the engine

26:12.362 --> 26:14.364
<i>based upon how much fuel it requires.</i>

26:23.207 --> 26:25.876
This pointer shows
a few parameters... real-time.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.170
That's extremely important
to tuning your vehicle.

26:28.337 --> 26:30.297
I have everything from hub RPM,

26:30.422 --> 26:34.301
which is the RPM that the wheel
sees itself, to engine RPM.

26:34.551 --> 26:37.054
And you'll see real-time
the horsepower the car is putting out.

26:37.221 --> 26:39.473
This is how you know
how well tuned your car is.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.101
<i>This is how I know if my car makes
200 horsepower,</i>

26:42.267 --> 26:43.936
<i>seven hundred horsepower, or 1000.</i>

26:44.144 --> 26:46.188
<i>It's extremely accurate
and very sensitive.</i>

26:46.271 --> 26:48.816
<i>I can turn the headlights on
and see a difference in power.</i>

26:57.574 --> 27:00.702
<i>The average supercar does hover
in the 600-horsepower range.</i>

27:00.953 --> 27:03.539
This eclipses that by a full 400 horses.

27:04.248 --> 27:07.459
<i>When I roll up to the race day, people
are gonna be shocked by its performance.</i>

27:07.626 --> 27:09.586
- I'm ready.
- This is for credibility,

27:09.837 --> 27:12.714
this is for street cred,
this is for prestige.

27:13.507 --> 27:15.008
Damn. Damn.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.105
<i>Today we're testing.</i>

27:29.523 --> 27:32.693
<i>Give it a good shake down,
make sure everything is working good.</i>

27:34.528 --> 27:36.655
<i>I just drive it there,
change out the tires</i>

27:36.780 --> 27:38.490
<i>so that way it gets better traction.</i>

27:39.074 --> 27:42.536
Put them at 15 and then we'll... we'll see
what they look like visually.

27:42.619 --> 27:46.456
<i>I try to beat my best time
I've ever had.</i>

27:47.291 --> 27:48.750
Look at that. Technology.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.211
Oh, we're good. Here you go.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.422
All right,
I think we're ready to race.

27:55.299 --> 27:58.719
<i>When I pull up into staging,
repetitively going over it,</i>

27:59.094 --> 28:00.762
<i>keeping yourself calm.</i>

28:03.891 --> 28:06.727
<i>So that way when you go out there
and the lights come down,</i>

28:06.894 --> 28:08.395
<i>it's just natural.</i>

28:09.438 --> 28:10.814
<i>You don't wanna jump the gun</i>

28:11.023 --> 28:13.025
<i>right when that light's right where
it needs to be.</i>

28:13.817 --> 28:15.819
<i>You predict it and you go right on time.</i>

28:21.450 --> 28:24.036
<i>The first test
was on the slow side.</i>

28:24.119 --> 28:27.706
<i>Breaking 100 miles an hour
is pretty hard to do.</i>

28:29.041 --> 28:32.085
<i>It spun a little bit, so...
I mean, it's hot.</i>

28:32.753 --> 28:35.756
<i>It was 14 PSI and we're gonna try ten.</i>

28:36.965 --> 28:39.468
<i>And now it's time to add nitrous
to the mix.</i>

28:40.552 --> 28:42.804
<i>I need to win, because I always do.</i>

28:43.180 --> 28:45.307
<i>Watch out, the Odyssey is coming.</i>

28:48.560 --> 28:51.480
<i>Motorsports is really
a passion for me.</i>

28:51.563 --> 28:54.107
<i>It's a chance for me to go
out and compete, you know,</i>

28:54.316 --> 28:55.984
at 45 years old, it's...

28:58.028 --> 29:01.573
one of the few ways that I can
still compete at that level.

29:02.616 --> 29:05.452
<i>So, this race is gonna be
interesting, I guess.</i>

29:05.535 --> 29:09.706
<i>I know some of these sleeper cars
can surprise you.</i>

29:10.666 --> 29:11.959
<i>Obviously, I like to win.</i>

29:20.008 --> 29:21.802
<i>That light is everything, Hannah.</i>

29:21.885 --> 29:24.054
<i>You just keep your eye
on that top light.</i>

29:24.221 --> 29:25.305
When that thing goes off...

29:30.811 --> 29:32.104
Does it look good?

29:32.479 --> 29:36.358
Is it important that we go out there
and win a race? Absolutely.

29:45.659 --> 29:47.536
<i>I'm 100 percent ready.</i>

29:48.078 --> 29:50.539
<i>I feel bad for anybody
that has to go up against me.</i>

29:52.666 --> 29:54.918
<i>There's really not much
preparation in this thing.</i>

29:55.127 --> 29:57.587
It's just drop the fucking clutch
and go, right?

30:02.718 --> 30:04.928
<i>Somebody's got to win,
somebody's got to lose.</i>

30:05.220 --> 30:07.014
<i>That's just the game.</i>

30:38.378 --> 30:40.088
Babe, you wanna grab my chair?

30:43.759 --> 30:45.093
Let's take you to...

30:47.929 --> 30:49.056
Car number two.

30:50.724 --> 30:53.352
What the hell is that?

30:53.977 --> 30:56.855
No freaking way.
That's the Lunch Money truck.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.024
I've seen them at Irwindale all the time.

31:00.442 --> 31:01.985
- Oh, it's Maloof.
- Maloof.

31:02.444 --> 31:04.946
- It's Hot Rod Hannah.
- Yup.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.990
- Do you know those people?
- Mm-hm.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.450
- Super rich.
- Yeah, I know.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.285
I think I know those guys.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.930
- Which ones?
- The guys that run the Lunch Money truck.

31:13.121 --> 31:15.791
- Let the shit-talking begin.
- I love it.

31:18.919 --> 31:20.295
What a beautiful day.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.591
- Hey, man.
- How you all doing?

31:24.674 --> 31:26.354
- Good, man. I'm Rob.
- Yeah, Sammy Maloof.

31:26.426 --> 31:28.595
- It's very nice to meet you.
- Met him and your gal.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.678
- Where's your gal today?
- She's sitting in there.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.474
Wonderful, man. Beautiful.

31:32.682 --> 31:35.352
- I'm so glad you guys are here.
- Gonna be a good race.

31:35.435 --> 31:37.896
- How are you? Good.
- Hi. How's it going?

31:38.105 --> 31:40.982
- Ready to show a Ford GT what's up?
- Yeah.

31:43.819 --> 31:46.113
Oh my God. Is this the other sleeper?

31:47.364 --> 31:48.532
Oh, yeah.

31:52.035 --> 31:54.162
<i>Well, at least I'm not
the least aerodynamic.</i>

32:01.086 --> 32:02.504
That sounds pretty good, though.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.634
Okay

32:08.093 --> 32:09.803
- Okay.
- Laid out.

32:09.886 --> 32:12.055
Yeah. That's how
we like to cruise.

32:12.139 --> 32:13.598
Take your kids to soccer in that?

32:13.682 --> 32:15.475
There you go. Oh, man.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.287
- This thing a front-wheel drive?
- Front-wheel drive, still yeah.

32:18.311 --> 32:19.563
Yeah, absolutely.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.691
Now, we're waiting
on the supercar.

32:24.401 --> 32:26.445
Uh-oh.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.738
Here it is.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.576
And then you got the Ford GT.

32:37.998 --> 32:40.167
This is gonna be funny.

32:42.127 --> 32:45.005
- There's the competition.
- Yup.

32:45.338 --> 32:49.134
And he doesn't even really have
a tire on it so that's good for us.

32:51.470 --> 32:54.181
- What's up, guys? How's it going?
- What's up man? How's it going?

32:54.723 --> 32:57.225
- How's it going? My name's Corey.
- Corey, what's going on?

32:57.517 --> 32:58.810
Is this your guys'?

33:06.318 --> 33:07.652
Holy shit.

33:09.571 --> 33:12.240
- What about the...
- Minivan?

33:13.325 --> 33:16.328
- That's a... what, 1,029 Horsepower?
- Four wheel or front wheel?

33:16.411 --> 33:18.091
- Front wheel.
- Front wheel.

33:18.121 --> 33:21.082
- Hmm.
- It's got a really nice tire on it but...

33:22.834 --> 33:24.836
He should be almost 5,000 pounds.

33:25.295 --> 33:29.257
Front-wheel drive, so it's gonna be
really trying to pull the weight.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.844
I don't know how I haven't seen
this thing before.

33:32.928 --> 33:35.764
- No worries, it's been around.
- What's underneath the...

33:35.847 --> 33:37.807
- Under the hood?
- Some really interesting stuff.

33:37.849 --> 33:38.849
I'm sure.

33:41.061 --> 33:43.897
<i>By looking at the van,
what is it gonna tell me? Nothing.</i>

33:44.022 --> 33:46.650
I mean, I can look at certain things
and know that there's been

33:46.733 --> 33:48.610
big, huge modifications.

33:49.402 --> 33:50.779
Very cool.

33:51.738 --> 33:52.906
I want turbos.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.409
<i>I got the minivan by half of it</i>

33:56.493 --> 33:58.703
and I think it's 5,000 pounds.

33:58.828 --> 34:00.413
I'm 2,500.

34:00.956 --> 34:05.252
<i>I'm sure the pickup truck's probably
4,000. Something like that.</i>

34:05.335 --> 34:07.796
<i>And I got the supercar by 1000 pounds.</i>

34:07.879 --> 34:10.632
<i>Manual gearbox, no traction control.</i>

34:11.049 --> 34:12.884
<i>There's a lot of room for error.</i>

34:13.927 --> 34:16.513
Let's go look at the truck.
I bet you he keeps it closed.

34:17.429 --> 34:19.139
Yup. You don't get to see shit.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.018
Pop the hood.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.145
I wanna know.

34:24.271 --> 34:26.940
<i>I've never seen Hannah's
truck before. It's my first time.</i>

34:27.107 --> 34:30.068
You definitely don't know
what's under the hood until you hear it.

34:30.443 --> 34:32.445
The pickup truck, I don't know much about

34:32.612 --> 34:34.906
<i>'cause the guy won't let me
get close to it.</i>

34:35.991 --> 34:38.909
<i>He's very secretive,
but when we get out there,</i>

34:38.994 --> 34:41.288
<i>I'm gonna win because that's what I do.</i>

34:44.708 --> 34:45.917
Wow.

34:47.460 --> 34:50.213
I've seen a very nice variety
of cars here.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.922
<i>From an old-school rat rod...</i>

34:53.382 --> 34:54.426
Hmm.

34:54.509 --> 34:57.804
<i>...to a very, very well-put together
pickup truck.</i>

34:57.887 --> 35:01.850
<i>It looks really sleeper but the tire size,
the compound on that vehicle,</i>

35:02.017 --> 35:05.604
how it's set up. There's something
going on there. More than meets the eye.

35:06.062 --> 35:08.315
We got a brick. You know,
we got a building here.

35:08.440 --> 35:12.152
You know, it's not
the most desirable... sleeper car.

35:12.444 --> 35:16.573
The one that has the most disadvantage
is the one that's the most insecure here.

35:17.741 --> 35:19.784
Drivers, may I have
your attention, please?

35:20.035 --> 35:21.536
We thank you guys for coming out.

35:21.620 --> 35:25.081
What we're going to do is go out
and walk the track.

35:25.415 --> 35:26.976
Make sure you're comfortable
with the track.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.294
Let's race. Race time.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.008
<i>It's the desert. It's hot.</i>

35:35.717 --> 35:37.677
<i>And then asphalt adds to that.</i>

35:38.887 --> 35:43.391
<i>The goal for the day is not to run
the truck, like as much as possible.</i>

35:45.435 --> 35:46.895
Let me see your gauge, bro.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.734
Holy mackerel. 141.5.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.738
Turn up the boost.

35:59.366 --> 36:01.117
<i>I've never raced
in these conditions.</i>

36:01.201 --> 36:03.244
<i>Heat is always the enemy
of performance.</i>

36:04.412 --> 36:06.724
Here's what I'm concerned
about right here, Hannah.

36:06.748 --> 36:09.376
None of that track matters
over there. What matters is right here.

36:10.210 --> 36:12.295
Yeah.
There's a few rocks over here.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.714
Kick them all off.
Get them off that road.

36:14.798 --> 36:18.218
They're all a quarter mile long.
So, I think we'll be all right.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.146
Let's just pray.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.483
We pray for the drivers
right now that they'll all be safe.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.069
Father, we thank you
that you got a hedge of protection

36:36.194 --> 36:38.363
around Hannah and all the drivers.

36:38.571 --> 36:39.906
- Amen.
- Amen.

36:52.001 --> 36:54.003
<i>Burnouts are very crucial
to a race.</i>

36:54.129 --> 36:55.964
<i>If you can't get your car to hook up,</i>

36:56.047 --> 36:58.758
<i>then all that horsepower is wasted
and working against you.</i>

37:06.015 --> 37:08.059
<i>I think doing a burnout</i>

37:08.143 --> 37:11.688
<i>is gonna get my tires hot and slippery.</i>

37:12.147 --> 37:13.773
<i>So instead of doing the burnout,</i>

37:13.982 --> 37:17.360
<i>we're gonna go with keeping
the engine temp as cool as possible.</i>

37:20.530 --> 37:23.658
<i>This is for street cred.
This is for prestige.</i>

37:24.534 --> 37:27.996
<i>I need to win. Because I always do.
It's what I do.</i>

37:29.164 --> 37:31.666
<i>Hannah knows what
she's got to do behind that wheel.</i>

37:32.125 --> 37:35.545
<i>Winning is important to me.
I can do this.</i>

37:38.173 --> 37:40.300
<i>Stay in my lane,
stay out of trouble.</i>

37:40.842 --> 37:43.136
<i>I have no idea whatsoever
what's gonna happen.</i>

37:43.762 --> 37:45.930
<i>Any of these cars could win it.</i>

37:47.599 --> 37:49.559
<i>Winning it, would prove</i>

37:49.642 --> 37:53.271
<i>that me being in a wheelchair
doesn't really matter.</i>

37:54.272 --> 37:55.272
Everybody ready?

38:13.416 --> 38:16.503
- Wow! She launched.
- Fuck yeah, Corey, get it.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.937
That's sick.

38:35.146 --> 38:38.191
She had him all the way.
I don't know what happened at the end.

38:39.901 --> 38:42.195
Well... good for him.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.388
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

38:50.537 --> 38:51.538
Fuck yeah.

38:51.788 --> 38:54.249
- How did you do?
- Third.

38:54.707 --> 38:57.126
- You got third?
- It was a good idea to not...

38:58.211 --> 39:00.672
to not warm the tires up. 100 percent.

39:02.215 --> 39:04.968
Good game plan, guys. Hell, yeah.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.469
I always win.

39:06.928 --> 39:09.180
Even for me to even be last,
I've never done that.

39:09.305 --> 39:12.809
Lunch Money got first.
GT got second.

39:13.226 --> 39:14.435
I'm not used to that.

39:15.854 --> 39:16.896
- Good job.
- Thank you.

39:16.980 --> 39:19.107
Yeah. Well done. That thing's fast.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.150
Well, front-wheel drive.

39:22.068 --> 39:23.862
- That was fun. Yeah.
- Okay. Thank you.

39:24.404 --> 39:26.281
- Good job, guys.
- Well done, sir.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.533
- Thank you very much.
- No worries. No worries.

39:28.658 --> 39:31.218
- You too, man. Good job.
- Thank you, thank you. It's fun.

39:31.244 --> 39:33.204
- But...
- Have a look at my tire marks.

39:33.454 --> 39:34.956
Time to go to the finale.

39:39.335 --> 39:41.296
- Look at that.
- Yeah.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.298
Soon as I got in
into the nitrous,

39:43.923 --> 39:48.052
<i>it just spun and spun and spun.
And I was just guiding the missile.</i>

39:49.304 --> 39:52.473
<i>I just held it straight and figured
I was going into the dirt,</i>

39:52.599 --> 39:55.727
<i>or through the flags. And we went
through the flags first.</i>

39:55.894 --> 39:58.521
<i>I just happened to get
just enough traction</i>

39:58.605 --> 40:01.774
<i>and I weigh less that it was just pushing
me out in front of them.</i>

40:04.402 --> 40:06.571
<i>I think one of the biggest
challenges with...</i>

40:06.779 --> 40:09.449
<i>my car and the other two,</i>

40:09.532 --> 40:12.827
<i>the van and the truck were just
almost too much horsepower, right?</i>

40:12.911 --> 40:15.455
So... just goes to prove

40:15.538 --> 40:18.499
you can't change physics, ultimately.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.294
Set of slicks, it would've had
a better deal, but...

40:22.253 --> 40:24.297
the import didn't beat you.

40:24.881 --> 40:25.882
Mm-hm.

40:26.633 --> 40:27.675
Look at that.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.010
- Good job.
- Thank you.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.346
Yeah, you laid some dark ones.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.431
<i>You ran clean
and you ran a good race.</i>

40:33.514 --> 40:36.517
Before we get into the results, I want
to give you guys a round of applause.

40:36.643 --> 40:38.227
- It was outstanding.
- Thank you.

40:38.353 --> 40:42.065
Outstanding. All right.
So, we have first place,

40:42.774 --> 40:44.484
Corey.

40:44.609 --> 40:46.409
- Attaboy, Corey.
- Nice job, nice job.

40:46.569 --> 40:49.072
- Thank you, guys.
- Second place, Erik.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.324
- Outstanding, very nice.
- Nice job, nice job.

40:51.407 --> 40:52.700
Third place, Hannah.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.744
- Did a wonderful job.
- Yeah!

40:55.411 --> 40:58.456
And fourth place, Bisi.
Thank you for coming out, so...

40:58.539 --> 41:01.250
It gives me a lot of food for thought
on what to do to optimize

41:01.376 --> 41:03.920
this setup for that type of racing,
you know?

41:04.045 --> 41:07.173
So, I learned a lot, it's good.
I have good data.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.176
<i>It was pretty close.
It was real close.</i>

41:10.551 --> 41:11.594
It was.

41:12.053 --> 41:15.139
<i>I wouldn't have put
my bet on the rat rod,</i>

41:15.390 --> 41:16.849
but they did a good job.

41:17.141 --> 41:20.436
I was a little nervous,
but didn't really have much of a problem

41:20.520 --> 41:22.730
up against the competition so...

41:24.232 --> 41:26.109
<i>I was definitely proud to win,</i>

41:26.275 --> 41:29.153
<i>and prove that a garage-built hot rod
could beat a supercar.</i>

41:30.571 --> 41:32.031
<i>It's... it's a good feeling.</i>

41:32.865 --> 41:34.826
<i>Yeah, let's... let's do it again.</i>

41:35.305 --> 41:41.942
