WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.673
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE FINALLY BACK.

00:02.673 --> 00:04.004
SERIOUSLY?

00:04.004 --> 00:06.537
IT FEELS LIKE WE'VE
BEEN GONE OVER A YEAR.

00:06.537 --> 00:10.111
I HONESTLY THOUGHT WE MIGHT
NEVER BE IN THIS KITCHEN AGAIN.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.412
YOU KNOW, JUST HANGING OUT,

00:11.412 --> 00:14.085
TELLING OUR STORIES
TO EACH OTHER,

00:14.085 --> 00:15.416
TO THE WORLD.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.348
(all) MM.

00:17.348 --> 00:19.150
WHERE WERE YOU GUYS?

00:19.150 --> 00:20.691
OVER AT ELLIE'S.
BUT WE RAN OUT OF WINE.

00:20.691 --> 00:22.022
IT GOT REALLY INTENSE.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.424
YEAH.
MM-HMM.

00:25.056 --> 00:26.357
HERE YOU GO.

00:26.357 --> 00:27.558
WOW.

00:27.558 --> 00:29.660
OOH.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.134
(spits)
(pops)

00:33.134 --> 00:35.466
(pop)
RACK 'EM UP, DIME EYES.

00:35.466 --> 00:37.238
ON IT.

00:39.710 --> 00:41.072
(Travis) WOW.

00:41.072 --> 00:44.215
ARE YOU GUYS ALCOHOLICS?
ARE YOU ALL IN A.A.?

00:44.215 --> 00:46.217
HONEY, THAT'S
TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS.

00:46.217 --> 00:47.618
OKAY, LOCK AND LOAD,
EVERYONE.

00:47.618 --> 00:49.480
WHEW.
WAIT.

00:49.480 --> 00:50.681
YOU GUYS, I READ SOMETHING.

00:50.681 --> 00:52.223
ALREADY NOT A TRUE STORY.

00:52.223 --> 00:54.185
FINE.
SOMEONE TOLD ME SOMETHING.

00:54.185 --> 00:55.626
WHEN YOU TOAST
AND CLINK GLASSES,

00:55.626 --> 00:59.590
IT'S CRAZY BAD LUCK TO DRINK
BEFORE THE GLASS STOPS RINGING.

00:59.590 --> 01:01.832
FAIR ENOUGH.
CHEERS, Y'ALL.

01:01.832 --> 01:03.164
(glasses clink)

01:03.164 --> 01:06.567
(glass ringing)
(Laurie) OH.

01:08.239 --> 01:11.242
(ringing continues)

01:11.242 --> 01:13.274
OH, GOOD GOD.
LET'S CHANCE IT.
(ringing stops)

01:13.274 --> 01:15.106
(chuckles)

01:15.106 --> 01:16.347
MMM. OH, MY GOD.
MMM.

01:16.347 --> 01:17.678
OHH. WHOO.

01:17.678 --> 01:18.849
THAT'S REALLY NICE.
THAT'S REALLY NICE.

01:18.849 --> 01:20.151
THAT'S REALLY NICE.
(laughs)

01:20.151 --> 01:27.588
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:27.588 --> 01:29.820
BE HONEST.
ARE YOU HAPPY?

01:29.820 --> 01:31.522
ARE YOU KIDDING?

01:31.522 --> 01:33.224
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR A WEEK,

01:33.224 --> 01:35.596
AND I'VE ONLY REGRETTED IT,
LIKE, TWICE.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.469
HEY, RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU HAD
AN INCREDIBLY SEXY TIME

01:38.469 --> 01:41.172
WITH YOUR SPOUSE LAST NIGHT.

01:42.133 --> 01:43.304
OH, COME ON, ELLIE.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.176
WHAT?
OH, I'M NOT BEING MEAN.

01:45.176 --> 01:47.107
I JUST DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.780
I TOOK AN AMBIEN LAST NIGHT,
AND I TOLD ANDY TO GO NUTS.

01:49.780 --> 01:51.842
DID YOU HAVE FUN, BOO?

01:51.842 --> 01:55.216
WELL, I CROSSED A FEW THINGS
OFF MY NAUGHTY BUCKET LIST.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.547
ATTABOY.

01:56.547 --> 01:58.549
DON'T TELL ME NOW.
I JUST ATE.
OH, OKAY.

01:58.549 --> 02:00.691
OOH. TELL ME ONE.

02:00.691 --> 02:02.253
(whispers indistinctly)

02:02.253 --> 02:04.425
(chuckles)

02:04.425 --> 02:05.726
YOU OKAY?

02:05.726 --> 02:07.898
I DON'T THINK
I'LL EVER BE OKAY.

02:07.898 --> 02:09.230
HEY, WEEK ONE,

02:09.230 --> 02:11.732
DIDN'T YOU MAKE JULES
COFFEE YESTERDAY?

02:11.732 --> 02:12.733
SO?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.134
ROOKIE MISTAKE.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.536
YOU KNOW THE FIRST FEW WEEKS
OF MARRIAGE,

02:15.536 --> 02:17.268
EVERYTHING'S A PRECEDENT?

02:17.268 --> 02:18.709
YOU DO SOMETHING TWICE,

02:18.709 --> 02:21.372
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS FOREVER.

02:21.372 --> 02:22.713
AFTER WE GOT MARRIED,

02:22.713 --> 02:25.376
DUMMY HERE MADE THE MISTAKE
OF ONLY PEEING IN THE HOUSE.

02:25.376 --> 02:26.717
HE'D WAIT
TILL HE GOT TO THE OFFICE

02:26.717 --> 02:28.519
FOR HIS MORE HORRIFYING
BATHROOM NEEDS.

02:28.519 --> 02:30.581
TELL THEM
THE HAPPY ENDING.

02:30.581 --> 02:33.153
NEVER POO'ed
IN MY OWN HOME.

02:35.526 --> 02:37.528
NO.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.891
PLEASE.

02:40.891 --> 02:43.334
I DON'T SUDDENLY HAVE TO MAKE
COFFEE EVERY MORNING.
(door closes)

02:43.334 --> 02:44.295
RIGHT, BABE?

02:44.295 --> 02:45.466
NO. (chuckles)

02:45.466 --> 02:46.797
I FINALLY GOT A COFFEE BITCH.

02:46.797 --> 02:48.569
I KNOW.
I'M SO HAPPY FOR US.

02:48.569 --> 02:49.900
OH.
OH.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.303
HONEY, I NEED SOME MORE CREAM.
(chuckles)

02:52.303 --> 02:53.444
THAT'S HOW YOU WANT
TO PLAY THIS?

02:55.646 --> 02:58.309
DO I WANT TO KNOW
WHY MY NECK IS SO SORE?
(door opens and closes)

02:58.309 --> 03:01.252
NO. NOT--NOT EVER.

03:01.252 --> 03:02.753
(gravely voice) SO... LAURIE.

03:02.753 --> 03:04.285
(clears throat)

03:04.285 --> 03:06.387
(normal voice)
SORRY. MORNING VOICE.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.688
IT'S 2:30.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.220
TRAV, I LIVE IN A PARKING LOT.

03:09.220 --> 03:11.722
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE SPOKEN ALL DAY.

03:11.722 --> 03:13.524
SO, LAURIE, HOW'S WADE?

03:13.524 --> 03:15.826
I HAVE BEEN CALLING HIM
IN AFGHANISTAN

03:15.826 --> 03:18.599
SO MUCH, YOU GUYS.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.572
THE OTHER NIGHT,
WE ACTUALLY PLAYED MONOPOLY

03:21.572 --> 03:23.334
ON THE PHONE.

03:23.334 --> 03:24.905
B.T. DUBS, I'M KIND OF
OBSESSED WITH MONOPOLY.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.937
IN HIGH SCHOOL, I ONCE HAD
A BACKSEAT QUICKIE WITH A GUY

03:26.937 --> 03:29.540
JUST 'CAUSE HIS NAME
WAS MARVIN GARDENS.

03:29.540 --> 03:32.313
ANYWAY, THE POINT IS,
I PLAYED MONOPOLY SO MUCH,

03:32.313 --> 03:34.245
THAT ALL THE KIDS CALLED ME
COMMUNITY CHEST. (laughs)

03:34.245 --> 03:36.216
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S WHY THEY CALLED--

03:36.216 --> 03:37.318
DUDE, JUST LET ME
HAVE THAT ONE.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.749
(laughs)
(cell phone rings)

03:38.749 --> 03:40.421
OOH! HEY, BABY.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.253
YOU REMEMBER LAST WEEK
WHEN YOU GOT ALL DRUNK

03:42.253 --> 03:43.594
AND YOU TOLD HER
THAT YOU LOVED HER?

03:43.594 --> 03:44.755
NOPE.

03:44.755 --> 03:45.926
REALLY?

03:45.926 --> 03:47.258
OF COURSE I DO.

03:47.258 --> 03:49.260
GOD, YOU'RE AWESOME
AT PICKING UP ON SARCASM.

03:49.260 --> 03:51.302
(chuckles) ACTUALLY, SON,
I'M NOT.

03:51.302 --> 03:53.304
BUT, TRAV, YOU NEVER TELL
A LADY HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HER

03:53.304 --> 03:54.635
IF YOU'VE BEEN DRINKIN'.

03:54.635 --> 03:57.338
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU GIVE ME
DAD LESSONS.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.238
SARCASM?

03:58.238 --> 03:59.440
YEAH.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.712
SEE, I CAN PICK UP ON IT
IF I REALLY FOCUS.

04:01.712 --> 04:03.744
LOOK, EVER SINCE
YOU TURNED 21,

04:03.744 --> 04:05.245
I'VE BEEN WORRYING
THAT I DIDN'T TEACH YOU

04:05.245 --> 04:07.378
ALL THAT I WANTED TO
ABOUT BEING A MAN.

04:07.378 --> 04:08.619
NOW I MEAN,
I COVERED THE BASICS--

04:08.619 --> 04:12.252
HONESTY, LOYALTY,
THE BIRDS AND THE BEES.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.624
MY DAD'S BIG TIP
FOR DRIVING THE LADIES WILD,

04:13.624 --> 04:15.956
AND I QUOTE,
"GET HER BUTT-NAKED

04:15.956 --> 04:17.658
AND KISS EVERYTHING
BUT THE GOOD PARTS."

04:17.658 --> 04:18.859
NONE-A-LINGUS.

04:20.761 --> 04:21.962
MWAH.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.364
OH, I POURED YOU
A GLASS OF WINE.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.736
OH, JUST LIKE
YOU DID YESTERDAY.

04:25.736 --> 04:27.368
OH.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.869
NO, NO, NO. NO, THIS DOESN'T
COUNT AS A PRECEDENT

04:28.869 --> 04:30.701
BECAUSE, UH, YOU, UH,
YOU DIDN'T GET IT YET.

04:34.445 --> 04:35.976
AH! NO, NO, NO.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.878
NO, NO, NO, NO.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.910
YES!
DAMN IT.

04:39.910 --> 04:41.382
NOW I HAVE A WINE GUY.

04:41.382 --> 04:44.054
WINE GUY
AND COFFEE BITCH.

04:44.054 --> 04:46.557
THE WORLD'S
TWO WORST SUPERHEROES.

04:46.557 --> 04:47.958
YOU KNOW, THIS STINKS.

04:47.958 --> 04:49.360
YOU KNOW, THE ONLY THING
I'VE WON SO FAR

04:49.360 --> 04:50.821
IS THAT JULES HAS TO YANK

04:50.821 --> 04:52.693
ANY WEIRD OLD MAN HAIRS
GROWING OUT OF MY EARS,

04:52.693 --> 04:54.465
BUT SHE LIKES DOING THAT.
I REALLY DO.

04:54.465 --> 04:56.066
MM-HMM.

04:56.066 --> 04:57.468
OOH.
AAH!

04:57.468 --> 04:58.669
SORRY.
(mutters)

04:58.669 --> 05:00.371
WOW. THAT IS REALLY LONG.

05:00.371 --> 05:01.732
I COULD PROBABLY MAKE A BRACELET
OUT OF THAT THING. EW.

05:01.732 --> 05:03.574
BYE, SWEETIE.

05:03.574 --> 05:06.807
(door opens and closes)
JULES, NOT ONLY
DOES MY NECK HURT,

05:06.807 --> 05:09.940
I ALSO HAVE A RUG BURN
ON MY FOREHEAD.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.514
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

05:14.715 --> 05:15.916
YES.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.348
YOU'RE IN
MY PERSONAL SPACE.

05:17.348 --> 05:18.589
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

05:18.589 --> 05:19.920
NEVER.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.922
HEYA.
HEY, BOBBY.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.924
YO.
YOU GOT A SECOND?

05:23.924 --> 05:26.026
OF COURSE, JERRY.
OH, DAMN IT!

05:26.026 --> 05:27.928
EXCUSE ME.

05:30.661 --> 05:32.062
DUDE, I HAD TO BOLT.

05:32.062 --> 05:33.604
I OWE JERRY MONEY.

05:33.604 --> 05:35.005
NICE MOVE.

05:35.005 --> 05:36.937
MAN, THESE ICED COFFEES
ARE COLD.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.669
WELL, THEY ARE ICED.

05:38.669 --> 05:40.711
THAT'S ANOTHER
GOOD DAD LESSON, TRAV.

05:40.711 --> 05:43.544
IT'S NEVER A BAD IDEA
TO RUN AWAY FROM YOUR PROBLEMS.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.446
(laughs)

05:45.446 --> 05:46.947
OH, YOU'RE SERIOUS?

05:46.947 --> 05:48.679
SERIOUS AS A BRAIN FREEZE.

05:48.679 --> 05:50.020
THOSE AREN'T SERIOUS.

05:50.020 --> 05:51.452
TELL THAT TO AND-O.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.624
OHH! OHH!

05:53.624 --> 05:55.556
(slurps)
OHH!

05:55.556 --> 05:57.988
OOH! OOH!
OHH!

05:57.988 --> 05:59.690
GOOD LORD.

06:05.496 --> 06:07.698
MOST BARTENDERS
ARE SUCH FLIRTS.

06:07.698 --> 06:09.800
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
LOOK AT THAT GIRL.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.071
OH, WOW.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.774
HER BOOB JUST POPPED OUT
OF HER TOP.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.546
WHAT AM I, NEW?

06:15.546 --> 06:17.748
YOU ARE AWESOME.

06:17.748 --> 06:19.109
(chuckles)
YOU KNOW, HONEY,

06:19.109 --> 06:20.851
I DON'T WANT
OUR FIRST WEEK OF MARRIAGE

06:20.851 --> 06:24.815
TO BE SOME STUPID CONTEST
ABOUT SETTING PRECEDENTS.

06:24.815 --> 06:28.619
I WANT TO BE THE BEST WIFE
I CAN BE.

06:28.619 --> 06:29.820
DEAL.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.692
BYE.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.865
в™Єв™Єв™Є

06:34.865 --> 06:37.528
YOUR CHANGE, BEAUTIFUL.

06:37.528 --> 06:39.530
в™Єв™Єв™Є

06:39.530 --> 06:41.532
HELLO, BOYS.

06:41.532 --> 06:43.704
HEY, DIME-EYES, STOP THAT.
(scoffs)

06:45.405 --> 06:47.438
I WOULD NEVER
BEHAVE THAT WAY.

06:47.438 --> 06:48.979
YOU'D BETTER NOT.

06:48.979 --> 06:52.042
(both, sexy voices)
WHAT, WHAT.

06:54.685 --> 06:57.588
(grunts)
OW!

06:57.588 --> 06:59.750
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

07:01.091 --> 07:02.553
IT'S LATE.

07:02.553 --> 07:05.425
I'LL TELL YOU
IN THE MORNING.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.699
OW!

07:08.699 --> 07:10.931
STUPID MARRIAGE.

07:15.165 --> 07:17.568
OKAY, FINE,
COFFEE BITCH.

07:17.568 --> 07:18.969
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE
HIT YOU.

07:18.969 --> 07:20.711
I JUST... I HATE
WHEN PEOPLE ACT DIFFERENTLY

07:20.711 --> 07:22.573
BEHIND MY BACK.

07:22.573 --> 07:24.815
BE WHO YOU REALLY ARE.
AM I RIGHT?

07:24.815 --> 07:26.517
YES. SURE.
OBVIOUSLY.

07:26.517 --> 07:27.918
IN DREAMS.

07:27.918 --> 07:29.980
BE WHO YOU REALLY ARE
IN DREAMS.

07:29.980 --> 07:31.582
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

07:31.582 --> 07:32.953
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TWO WERE LESBIANS.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.154
(Ellie sighs)

07:34.154 --> 07:35.626
IT WOULD BE NICE
TO BE WITH SOMEONE

07:35.626 --> 07:36.827
WHO WASN'T SO HAIRY.

07:36.827 --> 07:38.589
LASERED SMOOTH...

07:38.589 --> 07:40.460
(whispers) ALL OVER.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.462
OKAY, WELL, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
SEE THAT LATER.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.194
ME TOO.
YEAH.

07:44.194 --> 07:48.098
YES, SOMETIMES WE LOOKS
AT EACH OTHER'S HOOS. MOVE ON.

07:48.098 --> 07:51.642
I MEAN, WHY DO GUYS FIND
THE MOST RANDOM THINGS SEXY?

07:51.642 --> 07:54.605
BOBBY LOST IT YESTERDAY
OVER SOME WOMAN'S HEIGHT.

07:54.605 --> 07:56.146
WELL, HOW TALL WAS SHE?

07:56.146 --> 07:57.548
5'7".
OH!

07:57.548 --> 07:59.049
OH-HO, DAMN.

07:59.049 --> 08:00.250
WHOO! 5'7".

08:00.250 --> 08:01.682
HEE-HEE-HEE!

08:01.682 --> 08:03.183
I'M 5'6".

08:04.685 --> 08:07.117
ALL MEN OUT.

08:07.117 --> 08:09.690
5'6"... (speaks indistinctly)
YOU'RE PREACHING
TO THE CHOIR, BUDDY.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.922
THAT DREAM
REALLY SPUN ME OUT.

08:11.922 --> 08:14.625
(door closes)
I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT
HOW FRAGILE MARRIAGES ARE

08:14.625 --> 08:17.227
AND HOW VULNERABLE
THEY MAKE YOU FEEL.

08:17.227 --> 08:21.131
THE WHOLE THING
IS MAKING ME, WELL...

08:21.131 --> 08:22.833
BLUE.

08:22.833 --> 08:24.605
NO.
(gasps) OH, GOD.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.876
WHEN YOU GET BLUE,

08:25.876 --> 08:27.277
YOU GET DARK BLUE.

08:27.277 --> 08:30.010
LIKE, ONE LITTLE NOTCH
ABOVE SUICIDAL.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.112
I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T HAD
TO DEAL WITH THIS SINCE

08:32.112 --> 08:33.844
THE-FAILING-MARRIAGE/

08:33.844 --> 08:36.246
FIRST-TIME-YOU-NOTICED-
YOUR-ARM-FAT CRISIS OF '06.

08:36.246 --> 08:38.749
YES.
I HAVE TO FIGHT THIS.

08:38.749 --> 08:40.791
I MEAN, I MEANT
WHAT I DREAM SAID TO GRAYSON.

08:40.791 --> 08:42.823
I MEAN, THIS IS
OUR FIRST WEEK OF MARRIAGE.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.825
I WANT HIM TO SEE
THE BEST OF ME.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.897
I DON'T WANT HIM TO THINK
HE MARRIED SOME WOMAN

08:46.897 --> 08:48.999
WITH A BUNCH OF JUNK
IN THE TRUNK.

08:50.300 --> 08:51.932
I KNOW I HAVE A FLAT BUTT,

08:51.932 --> 08:53.263
BUT I DECIDED THAT HAVING
"JUNK IN THE TRUNK"

08:53.263 --> 08:55.135
SHOULD MEAN
HAVING "EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE."

08:55.135 --> 08:56.567
THAT MAKES SENSE.

08:56.567 --> 08:58.869
CHANGE APPROVED.

09:00.571 --> 09:03.213
I-I'VE BEEN ON A REAL
DRY SPELL WITH THE LADIES.

09:03.213 --> 09:04.815
UH, BE HONEST.

09:04.815 --> 09:06.276
W-WOULD YOU HAVE SEX
WITH ME?

09:06.276 --> 09:07.678
TWO QUICK QUESTIONS.

09:07.678 --> 09:09.950
UH, IN THIS SCENARIO,
AM I A GIRL?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.752
OH, YEAH. A HOT ONE.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.283
(chuckles)
ALL RIGHT. COOL.

09:13.283 --> 09:16.757
AND BY HAVING SEX WITH YOU,
WOULD I BE SAVING THE WORLD?

09:16.757 --> 09:18.028
OH.
(whispers indistinctly)

09:18.028 --> 09:19.259
HEY, WEEK ONE.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.931
JULES IS SPINNING.

09:20.931 --> 09:22.262
IT WOULD REALLY HELP
IF YOU COULD APOLOGIZE

09:22.262 --> 09:23.864
FOR WHAT YOU DID
IN HER DREAM.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.296
NO PROBLEM. SHOULD I ALSO
BRING HER FLOWERS,

09:26.296 --> 09:27.998
OR SHOULD I JUST GIVE HER
ONE OF THOSE LITTLE RING BOXES

09:27.998 --> 09:30.000
WITH MY NUTS IN IT?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.603
IT'S SAD THAT THEY COULD FIT
IN A RING BOX.
(mouths words)

09:32.603 --> 09:35.205
LOOK... IF SHE SINKS
INTO A FULL-ON DEPRESSION,

09:35.205 --> 09:37.678
NO ONE'S SAFE. YOU WATCH.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.579
ANYONE WITH ESTROGEN
IS GONNA BE DRAGGED DOWN

09:39.579 --> 09:41.181
INTO THAT BLUE VORTEX.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.715
I WOULD APOLOGIZE, BUT I KNOW
HOW TO BEHAVE IN A DREAM.

09:44.715 --> 09:47.087
THAT IS EVEN MORE INSANE
THAN WHAT TOM JUST ASKED.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.620
LET'S SAY YOU WOULD BE
SAVING THE WORLD.

09:49.620 --> 09:51.762
WELL, YES, IN THAT CASE,
I WOULD HIT THAT.

09:51.762 --> 09:54.094
YES. STILL GOT IT.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.097
(whistling)

10:00.831 --> 10:02.973
ANDY.
YES.

10:02.973 --> 10:04.174
DID YOU FINISH
THE QUARTERLY ESTIMATE

10:04.174 --> 10:05.375
ON THE PRATT FILE?

10:05.375 --> 10:08.208
YES, LAST WEEK.
(chuckles)

10:08.208 --> 10:11.111
OH. OH, DAMN IT.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.343
OH, EXCUSE ME.

10:15.285 --> 10:16.687
(chuckles)

10:16.687 --> 10:17.948
I TOLD HIM I HAD
A FAMILY THING,

10:17.948 --> 10:19.349
AND I'D GIVE HIM
THE FILE IN THE MORNING.

10:19.349 --> 10:20.891
WORKED PERFECTLY.

10:20.891 --> 10:22.292
(mouth full) SEE, TRAV,
FIRST YOU RUN,

10:22.292 --> 10:24.624
AND THEN
YOU GATHER YOURSELF, AND...

10:24.624 --> 10:26.927
(normal voice)
YOU EVEN LISTENIN'?
DEFINITELY NOT.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.729
HOW'D YOU KNOW TO ANSWER?

10:28.729 --> 10:31.401
DAD, DEEP DOWN, YOU KNOW THAT
"RUN FROM YOUR PROBLEMS"

10:31.401 --> 10:33.133
IS TERRIBLE ADVICE.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.066
YOU'VE TAUGHT ME A LOT
OVER THE YEARS, OKAY?

10:36.066 --> 10:38.268
BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE,
THERE'S A BLIND SPOT.

10:38.268 --> 10:39.670
IT'S LIKE HOW YOU GIVE
BITES OF YOUR FOOD

10:39.670 --> 10:41.041
TO THE HOMELESS GUY--SHARK--

10:41.041 --> 10:43.113
AND THEN WONDER WHY
YOU GET SICK ALL THE TIME.

10:43.113 --> 10:45.215
JEEZ.

10:45.215 --> 10:46.817
YOU REALLY THINK
THERE'S A CORRELATION?

10:46.817 --> 10:48.378
I'M NOT A DOCTOR, BUT YES.

10:53.083 --> 10:54.985
GOOD CHOICE.

10:54.985 --> 10:56.386
90% OF THE TIME,

10:56.386 --> 10:58.689
I'M JUST
SUCH A POSITIVE PERSON,

10:58.689 --> 11:01.932
BUT THE OTHER 10%,
I GET SUPER DARK.

11:01.932 --> 11:04.995
I MEAN,
HUGE HIGHS AND LOWS.

11:04.995 --> 11:07.137
OH, SO LIKE
A BIPOLAR PERSON.

11:07.137 --> 11:09.039
EXACTLY. NO BIGGIE.

11:09.039 --> 11:11.041
YOU KNOW, I WAS GONNA TRY
ANTIDEPRESSANTS,

11:11.041 --> 11:13.003
BUT TOM CRUISE SAYS
THAT I CAN'T.

11:13.003 --> 11:14.344
YOU STILL MAKE
A LOT OF LIFE DECISIONS

11:14.344 --> 11:16.676
BASED ON WHAT TOM CRUISE
WOULD DO.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.378
MORE THAN I'D LIKE.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.111
LOOK, I GET WANTING YOUR FIRST
WEEK OF MARRIAGE TO BE PERFECT,

11:21.111 --> 11:22.953
BUT YOU GUYS HAVE
A REALLY STRONG BOND.

11:22.953 --> 11:24.254
YOU KNOW, LIKE, REMEMBER

11:24.254 --> 11:25.786
WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED
DATING GRAYSON,

11:25.786 --> 11:27.257
AND YOU SAID YOU WOULD
BREAK UP WITH HIM

11:27.257 --> 11:30.290
IF HE EVER LET HIMSELF GO
AND GAINED 100 POUNDS?

11:30.290 --> 11:31.762
(laughs)

11:31.762 --> 11:33.724
SEE,
THAT'S NOT TRUE ANYMORE.

11:33.724 --> 11:34.925
NO, IT STILL IS.

11:34.925 --> 11:36.927
I MEAN, 10 POUNDS, SURE.
BUT 100?

11:36.927 --> 11:39.699
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SPIT IN MY FACE?

11:39.699 --> 11:42.372
NO, WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
KEEP ACTING POSITIVE.

11:42.372 --> 11:44.835
PRETEND TO BE HAPPY,

11:44.835 --> 11:46.907
AND EVENTUALLY,
YOU PROBABLY WILL BE.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.308
I CAN DO THAT.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.240
I'M GREAT AT BEING FAKE.
(laughs)

11:50.240 --> 11:51.912
CHA-CHING. (laughing)

11:51.912 --> 11:53.914
THAT'S THE SOUND I THINK
YOU HEAR IN YOUR HEAD

11:53.914 --> 11:56.446
WHEN YOU REALIZE
HOW SCREWED UP I AM.

11:56.446 --> 11:58.919
(laughs) CLOSE.
ACTUALLY, IT'S MORE LIKE A--

11:58.919 --> 12:00.490
LIKE A SLOT MACHINE
WHEN IT PAYS OUT.

12:00.490 --> 12:02.853
LIKE, CHING-A-LING-A-LING.
AH, MONEY. RICH. HIGH FIVE.

12:02.853 --> 12:04.324
(laughs)

12:06.326 --> 12:08.158
OKAY. (sighs)

12:08.158 --> 12:10.831
WADE IS PERFECT ON PAPER.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.733
HE'S SWEET. HE'S RIPPED.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.937
HE'S SO BLACK, I FEEL LIKE I'M
IN A SENSORY DEPRIVATION TANK

12:16.937 --> 12:18.738
WHEN HE'S ON TOP OF ME.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.141
BUT HE'S GONNA BE
STATIONED OVERSEAS

12:21.141 --> 12:22.943
FOR A WHOLE NOTHER YEAR.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.444
YOU GUYS, I JUST DON'T KNOW

12:24.444 --> 12:26.817
IF I CAN MAKE THIS RELATIONSHIP
WORK OVER THE PHONE.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.882
WHAT? SORRY. UH,
BARTENDER DEFENSE MECHANISM.

12:31.882 --> 12:34.825
WHENEVER I GET REALLY BORED,
I JUST NOD AND ZONE OUT.

12:34.825 --> 12:37.928
I WARNED YOU.
JULES' DEPRESSION IS SPREADING.

12:37.928 --> 12:39.830
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

12:39.830 --> 12:43.834
WHAT? SORRY. WOW.
HAPPENED AGAIN. (chuckles)
LOOK, I--

12:43.834 --> 12:45.135
WHOA! IT HAPPENED
A THIRD TIME.

12:45.135 --> 12:48.038
THAT WAS A QUICK ONE.
LOOK, JULES IS FINE.

12:48.038 --> 12:50.000
IF SHE WASN'T,
SHE'D TELL ME.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.502
SHE'S NOT FINE.
SHE'S MISERABLE.

12:52.502 --> 12:54.404
HEY, BABE.

12:54.404 --> 12:56.176
WHY DON'T WE CUT OUT OF HERE
AND HIT THE BEACH FOR A WHILE?

12:56.176 --> 12:58.778
HELL, YEAH. (chuckles)

12:58.778 --> 13:01.982
WHY DON'T WE HAVE
A DANCE PARTY TONIGHT? HUH?

13:01.982 --> 13:04.184
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME
WE HAD A DANCE PARTY?

13:04.184 --> 13:06.186
NOT SINCE NEVER, EVER.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.557
WELL, THAT'S TOO LONG.

13:07.557 --> 13:11.361
BYE.
OH, THERE'S JERRY.

13:11.361 --> 13:13.864
NOW LOOK, INSTEAD OF RUNNING,
YOU'RE GONNA FACE THE MUSIC.

13:13.864 --> 13:15.395
OH, MAN.
I DON'T KNOW.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.297
COME ON.
CONFIDENCE DANCE.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.569
ALL RIGHT. GIVE ME THE MIRROR.
WHOO. HANDSOME. ALL RIGHT.

13:19.569 --> 13:21.872
ALL RIGHT.
HOW MUCH DO YOU OWE HIM?

13:21.872 --> 13:24.274
6 BUCKS.
(sighs)

13:24.274 --> 13:25.535
WE SPLIT A $12 PIZZA,
BUT I ATE THE WHOLE THING.

13:25.535 --> 13:27.007
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
SHARK AND I ATE IT,

13:27.007 --> 13:29.009
AND THEN I GOT
A NASTY HEAD COLD.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.240
HEY, BOBBY.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.511
JERRY.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.013
BOBBY.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.015
JERRY.
BOB.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.519
JULES, HONEY,
ARE YOU OKAY?

13:39.519 --> 13:41.351
(scoffs) ENOUGH OF THIS.
SHE'S FINE.

13:41.351 --> 13:43.954
(chuckles)
JUST LOOK AT HER.

13:43.954 --> 13:46.096
ANY LITTLE THING IS GONNA
PUT HER OVER THE EDGE.

13:46.096 --> 13:49.429
OH, COME ON, GIRLFRIEND.
DON'T BE RIDIC.

13:53.934 --> 13:57.908
(distorted voice)
OH, GOD.

13:57.908 --> 14:00.370
DON'T TELL ME
ELLIE'S RIGHT.

14:01.972 --> 14:03.243
JULES?

14:04.875 --> 14:07.017
HEY, J-BIRD!
HEY, BOBBY!

14:07.017 --> 14:10.420
IT'S AMAZING THAT I'M EVEN
KIND OF NORMAL.

14:13.924 --> 14:15.285
HEY.

14:15.285 --> 14:16.626
WHERE WERE YOU JUST NOW?

14:16.626 --> 14:19.459
I WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR
OF THE TUB SOBBING.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.361
YOU NEVER PEE IN THERE,
RIGHT?

14:21.361 --> 14:23.894
NO.

14:23.894 --> 14:26.336
I'M SORRY I HAVE
SO MUCH JUNK IN THE TRUNK.

14:27.938 --> 14:29.469
IT MEANS
"EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE" NOW.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.602
NO, IT DOESN'T. I HATE IT
WHEN YOU ALL DO THAT.

14:32.602 --> 14:34.945
LOOK, I GET LIKE THIS
ONCE EVERY BLUE MOON.

14:34.945 --> 14:36.576
IT'S OUR FIRST WEEK
OF MARRIAGE.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.348
I D--I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO HAVE TO SEE THAT.

14:38.348 --> 14:40.250
YOU SHOULD NEVER
HAVE TO SEE THAT.

14:40.250 --> 14:42.652
I SHOULD GET BACK TO WORK.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.959
UH, IT JUST--
IT BUMS ME OUT

14:48.959 --> 14:52.162
THAT YOU WOULDN'T TELL ME
HOW YOU'RE REALLY FEELING.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.926
DAGGER.

14:59.269 --> 15:01.571
WHY WOULD YOU TELL HIM
ABOUT MY BLUES?

15:01.571 --> 15:03.573
YOU KNEW I WANTED
TO KEEP THAT A SECRET.

15:03.573 --> 15:05.375
I'M SO MAD AT YOU.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.636
I KNOW.

15:06.636 --> 15:08.578
BUT YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME.

15:08.578 --> 15:09.980
TOM, NOW.

15:09.980 --> 15:11.181
(grunts)
AAH!

15:11.181 --> 15:13.443
GOT HER!
WHAT?

15:13.443 --> 15:15.215
HURRY!
SHE'S REALLY STRONG! OW!

15:15.215 --> 15:17.087
I JUST GOT A TEXT
FROM ONE OF MY GOLF CLIENTS,

15:17.087 --> 15:19.019
AND I CAN'T MAKE HEADS
OR TAILS OUT OF IT.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.091
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AGAIN
IF IT'S ALL CAPS?

15:21.091 --> 15:22.492
HE'S EITHER REALLY MAD

15:22.492 --> 15:25.095
OR REALLY EXCITED.

15:25.095 --> 15:28.558
SO IT'S EITHER
"WHAT ABOUT THAT GOLF LESSON?"

15:28.558 --> 15:33.263
OR... (chuckling)
"WHAT ABOUT THAT GOLF LESSON?"

15:33.263 --> 15:35.535
I'M ROLLING THE DICE
AND GOING POSITIVE.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.707
(keypad clicking)
"I KNOW.

15:37.707 --> 15:41.011
IT WAS AWESOME."

15:41.011 --> 15:42.442
NO WORRIES.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.944
IF HE DOES GET MAD,
YOU CAN ALWAYS JUST RUN AWAY.

15:44.944 --> 15:49.179
WHOO! NOW THAT IS A RITE
OF PASSAGE FOR A FATHER,

15:49.179 --> 15:51.251
TO HEAR THAT DISAPPOINTMENT
IN HIS SON'S VOICE.

15:51.251 --> 15:55.025
AND-O, YOU'RE WITH ME,
RIGHT?
AND-O?

15:55.025 --> 15:56.486
I'M TRYING IT OUT. COME ON.

15:56.486 --> 15:59.689
AN ADULT SHOULD NOT
HIDE FROM A LITTLE CONFLICT.

15:59.689 --> 16:02.592
I'LL SAY IT AGAIN.
NEVER POO'ed IN MY OWN HOME.

16:02.592 --> 16:04.664
YOU CALL YOURSELF A MAN.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.596
(laughs) NO, I DON'T.

16:06.596 --> 16:09.469
TRAV, YOU DON'T NEED ME TO TEACH
YOU THE BASICS OF BEING A MAN.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.472
BUT I'M A SURVIVOR. AND I COULD
TEACH YOU SOME STUFF

16:12.472 --> 16:14.744
FOR THOSE RARE OCCASIONS
WHEN THINGS AREN'T GOING WELL,

16:14.744 --> 16:16.446
LIKE HOW TO DEAL WITH COPS,

16:16.446 --> 16:18.548
OR HOW TO DODGE
BILL COLLECTORS,

16:18.548 --> 16:20.350
OR HOW TO AVOID
GETTING YOUR BUTT KICKED

16:20.350 --> 16:21.681
BY USING YOUR HEAD.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.213
YOU MEAN, LIKE,
TALK YOUR WAY THROUGH IT?

16:23.213 --> 16:27.087
NO, T-BONE.
USE YOUR HEAD. (grunts)

16:27.087 --> 16:29.089
YOU KNOW, I'M IN SUCH A FUNK.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.691
I'M GONNA SAY SOMETHING MY MOM
SHOULD'VE SAID TWO YEARS AGO

16:31.691 --> 16:33.263
THIS VERY NIGHT.

16:33.263 --> 16:36.596
I'M GONNA LEAVE
BEFORE I STAB A BITCH.

16:40.070 --> 16:42.632
OKAY, JULES.
I'M SO SORRY I--

16:42.632 --> 16:44.234
J-JUST ZIP IT.

16:44.234 --> 16:46.576
YOU HAVE APOLOGIZED TO ME
SO MANY TIMES IN OUR LIFE

16:46.576 --> 16:49.379
THAT I COULD DO
THE WHOLE CONVERSATION MYSELF.

16:49.379 --> 16:51.641
"ELLIE, I'M SO ANGRY AT YOU."
"SURE, SURE."

16:51.641 --> 16:54.184
"WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?"
"SURE, SURE."

16:54.184 --> 16:56.246
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE
A LITTLE STUCK ON "SURE, SURE."

16:56.246 --> 16:58.088
THEN YOU WOULD'VE SAID,
"NEH NEH NEH NEH NEH NEH,

16:58.088 --> 17:00.790
NEH NEH NEH NEH NEH
NEH NEH NEH," WHICH MEANS...

17:00.790 --> 17:02.392
YOU DIDN'T TAKE
THAT IMPROV CLASS

17:02.392 --> 17:05.195
I GOT YOU FOR CHRISTMAS,
DID YA?
WHICH MEANS?

17:05.195 --> 17:07.527
IT MEANS, I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN YOUR PROTECTOR.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.459
AND I ONLY TOLD GRAYSON

17:09.459 --> 17:12.302
SO HE WOULD BE MORE SYMPATHETIC
TO WHAT YOU WERE GOING THROUGH.

17:12.302 --> 17:15.305
HONEY,
I'M MARRIED NOW.

17:15.305 --> 17:17.137
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH,

17:17.137 --> 17:19.809
BUT THAT'S NOT
YOUR JOB ANYMORE.

17:19.809 --> 17:21.271
SURE, SURE.

17:21.271 --> 17:23.543
NOW AS YOUR PUNISHMENT...

17:23.543 --> 17:25.145
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU

17:25.145 --> 17:27.577
WHAT ANDY DID TO YOU
THE OTHER NIGHT.

17:27.577 --> 17:29.179
(clicks tongue)

17:31.221 --> 17:34.224
(whispering indistinctly)

17:37.657 --> 17:40.430
(imitates whirring noise)

17:40.430 --> 17:42.192
YEAH.

17:42.192 --> 17:44.434
LIVE WITH IT.

17:44.434 --> 17:45.695
(inhales)

17:45.695 --> 17:49.839
I AM SO TURNED ON RIGHT NOW.

17:49.839 --> 17:51.641
(gasps)

17:54.204 --> 17:56.106
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD
TO BE LAUGHED AT.

17:56.106 --> 17:58.578
THEN THAT HAIRCUT
WAS A BAD CHOICE.

17:58.578 --> 18:02.612
OH, GOOD. SHE STILL HAS
HER ADORABLE EDGE.

18:02.612 --> 18:04.414
I THOUGHT YOU PROMISED
THAT ANYONE WITH ESTROGEN

18:04.414 --> 18:07.117
WAS GONNA GET DEPRESSED.

18:07.117 --> 18:09.459
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF ANYTHING?

18:09.459 --> 18:11.461
JULES COBB IS THE LIGHT
OF OUR GROUP.

18:11.461 --> 18:14.794
AND AS SHE GOES,
SO GOES THE REST OF US.

18:14.794 --> 18:18.198
FOR MANY YEARS, I HAVE BEEN
THE KEEPER OF THAT LIGHT.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.830
BUT I NOW PASS THE TORCH
TO YOU.

18:20.830 --> 18:23.473
WELL, I'M ONLY TAKING THIS TORCH
BECAUSE I LOVE MIME.

18:23.473 --> 18:28.107
(whooshing sound)

18:31.641 --> 18:33.413
OKAY.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.315
WHAT ARE
MY RESPONSIBILITIES?

18:35.315 --> 18:37.487
YOU TAKE BULLETS,
YOU CLEAN UP MESSES,

18:37.487 --> 18:39.489
AND YOU DO ANYTHING
TO KEEP HER HAPPY,

18:39.489 --> 18:41.821
NO MATTER HOW INSANE
IT FEELS.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.323
в™Єв™Єв™Є

18:43.323 --> 18:45.425
YOU WERE
MARRIED TO HER, MAN.

18:45.425 --> 18:48.828
DID YOU USED TO APOLOGIZE FOR
WHAT YOU DID IN HER DREAMS?

18:48.828 --> 18:50.700
(laughs) HELL, NO.

18:50.700 --> 18:53.603
OF COURSE, NOW I LIVE ALONE
IN A PARKING LOT.

18:53.603 --> 18:56.506
GRAYSON, DID YOU EVER
HEAR THE EXPRESSION

18:56.506 --> 18:58.508
"HAPPY WIFE, HAPPY LIFE"?

18:58.508 --> 19:00.440
'CAUSE I TRY TO LIVE
BY THAT.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.811
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:01.811 --> 19:03.913
WELL, LET'S BE HONEST.
ANDY'S MY WIFE.

19:03.913 --> 19:05.775
I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

19:05.775 --> 19:09.379
JULES WOULD DIE FOR YOU, STUD.
WHAT ARE YOU PREPARED TO DO?

19:09.379 --> 19:10.850
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:10.850 --> 19:12.882
(Crystal Fighters'
"Champion Sound" playing)

19:12.882 --> 19:14.524
WELL, NO, IT JUST SUCKS

19:14.524 --> 19:16.526
BECAUSE MOST OF MY CURRENT
FEELINGS ABOUT FATHERHOOD

19:16.526 --> 19:18.788
COME FROM "THE ROAD"
BY CORMAC McCARTHY.

19:18.788 --> 19:20.390
OH, STOP.

19:20.390 --> 19:22.292
YOUR DAD ROCKS.

19:22.292 --> 19:23.593
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,

19:23.593 --> 19:26.266
IS THIS THE KIND OF
SMART-GUY "BLAH BLAH"

19:26.266 --> 19:28.298
THAT GETS
ALL THE COLLEGE GIRL PANTIES

19:28.298 --> 19:30.270
PILED UP
NEXT TO YOUR FUTON?

19:30.270 --> 19:31.741
I DON'T PUT 'EM IN A PILE.

19:31.741 --> 19:34.904
I WEAR THEM AS HEADBANDS
AS TRIBUTE.

19:34.904 --> 19:36.546
(laughs)

19:36.546 --> 19:38.278
YOU ARE SUCH A NERD.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.310
(laughs)

19:40.310 --> 19:44.454
OH, MY LIFE IS JUST
SO MESSED UP RIGHT NOW.

19:44.454 --> 19:47.417
SERIOUSLY,
WHAT IS SO MESSED UP?

19:47.417 --> 19:49.289
WADE...

19:49.289 --> 19:51.321
LIFE...

19:51.321 --> 19:53.293
YOU.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.564
в™Є DREAM MY LIFE AWAY в™Є

19:54.564 --> 19:56.195
TRAVIS, ARE WE EVER
GONNA TALK ABOUT

19:56.195 --> 19:58.428
ALL THAT STUFF THAT
YOU SAID TO ME LAST WEEK?

19:58.428 --> 20:01.271
SHOOT.

20:01.271 --> 20:02.732
EXCUSE ME.

20:02.732 --> 20:06.306

20:18.748 --> 20:21.321

20:21.321 --> 20:25.325
I AM SO SORRY
FOR HOW I ACTED IN YOUR DREAM.

20:25.325 --> 20:29.429
YOU ARE THE BEST THING
THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.900
в™Є LOVE WILL BE AMAZING в™Є

20:30.900 --> 20:33.263
в™Є CHAMPION SOUND в™Є

20:36.466 --> 20:38.538

20:38.538 --> 20:41.271

20:42.542 --> 20:43.873
в™Є I PLAY MY CONCERTINA в™Є

20:43.873 --> 20:45.975
в™Є TO AN ARENA FULL OF PEOPLE в™Є

20:45.975 --> 20:47.577

20:47.577 --> 20:50.019

20:50.019 --> 20:51.681

20:55.625 --> 20:56.986
в™Є I WANNA TRY TO SAY в™Є

20:56.986 --> 20:59.459
SO WHY DO WE STILL HAVE TO
HAVE A DANCE PARTY?

20:59.459 --> 21:00.660
BECAUSE THEY'RE AWESOME.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.931
(laughs)

21:01.931 --> 21:04.734
в™Є CHAMPION SOUND в™Є

THIS YEAR, ON "COUGAR TOWN"...

21:19.278 --> 21:20.750
EVERYTHING CHANGES.

21:20.750 --> 21:24.053
CALL THE HOSPITAL.
I'M HAVING THIS BABY NOW!

21:24.053 --> 21:25.655
AND SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.

21:25.655 --> 21:28.918
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ALL
HAVE THE SAME DADDY.

21:28.918 --> 21:31.621
LIFE-CHANGING DECISIONS
ARE MADE.

21:31.621 --> 21:33.292
WE HAVE TO TELL ELLIE
AND JULES.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.864
IF I HOLD THIS SECRET IN
ANY LONGER, I'LL GO--

21:34.864 --> 21:36.396
SHH.

21:38.027 --> 21:41.000
3-TIME OSCAR NOMINEE
MICHELLE WILLIAMS

21:41.000 --> 21:43.302
JOINS THE CAST

21:55.314 --> 21:57.717
SECRETS ARE REVEALED.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.989
I'VE GOT TO GO TO WORK,
AND MY CAR IS BROKEN.

21:59.989 --> 22:02.952
(cawing)

22:02.952 --> 22:06.856

22:09.499 --> 22:11.731
