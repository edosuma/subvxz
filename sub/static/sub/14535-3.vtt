Narrator:
<i> Previously on</i>
<i> "The American West"...</i>

00:09.250 --> 00:11.250
<i> Not even 100 years old,</i>

00:11.250 --> 00:14.750
<i> America finds itself</i>
<i> in a crippling depression</i>

00:14.750 --> 00:18.333
<i> and on the verge of a war</i>
<i> on two fronts.</i>

00:18.333 --> 00:21.750
<i> In Missouri, ex-Confederates</i>
<i> like Jesse James</i>

00:21.750 --> 00:25.041
<i> are terrorizing</i>
<i>Northern banks and railroads...</i>

00:25.041 --> 00:26.250
C'mon, Frank.

00:26.250 --> 00:27.750
<i> ...forcing businesses</i>
<i> to hire</i>

00:27.750 --> 00:30.375
<i> famed private detective</i>
<i> Allan Pinkerton</i>

00:30.375 --> 00:32.166
<i> to take him down.</i>

00:32.166 --> 00:34.667
He's ruthlessly violent
and good with a gun.

00:34.667 --> 00:36.542
When do I leave?

00:37.291 --> 00:38.792
Narrator:
<i> Further west,</i>

00:38.792 --> 00:40.333
<i> George Armstrong Custer</i>

00:40.333 --> 00:42.208
<i> has confirmed rumors</i>
<i> of gold</i>

00:42.208 --> 00:44.709
<i> in the Black Hills</i>
<i> of South Dakota,</i>

00:46.291 --> 00:50.375
<i> setting off</i>
<i> a massive gold rush.</i>

00:50.375 --> 00:53.333
<i> But the country's solution</i>
<i> to its financial crisis</i>

00:53.333 --> 00:57.083
<i> may lie in the heart</i>
<i> of sacred Indian territory,</i>

00:57.083 --> 01:01.125
<i> land that Lakota leaders</i>
<i> Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull</i>

01:01.125 --> 01:03.625
<i> aren't going to give up</i>
<i> without a fight.</i>

01:08.375 --> 01:12.417
<i> ( theme music playing )</i>

01:55.250 --> 01:57.250
<i> ( birds chirping )</i>

02:00.208 --> 02:03.375
Narrator:
<i> Midway through his second term</i>
<i> as president,</i>

02:03.375 --> 02:05.291
<i> Ulysses S. Grant</i>
<i> has watched the push</i>

02:05.291 --> 02:08.875
<i> to settle the West</i>
<i> and heal the nation</i>

02:08.875 --> 02:10.625
<i> come to a halt</i>

02:10.625 --> 02:13.667
<i> as America suffers</i>
<i> through a brutal depression.</i>

02:16.500 --> 02:19.709
If you are president
during an economic depression,

02:19.709 --> 02:22.458
your standing is gonna fall.

02:22.458 --> 02:24.375
<i> And this was the worst</i>
<i> economic depression</i>

02:24.375 --> 02:26.375
<i> in American history</i>
<i> up to that time.</i>

02:28.542 --> 02:32.667
Narrator:
<i> But Grant believes</i>
<i> he's found a solution--</i>

02:32.667 --> 02:36.792
<i> the gold in the Black Hills</i>
<i> of South Dakota.</i>

02:36.792 --> 02:38.250
<i> The only problem--</i>

02:38.250 --> 02:40.250
<i> it's on land</i>
<i> that Grant surrendered</i>

02:40.291 --> 02:43.208
<i> to the Lakota Sioux</i>
<i> nine years earlier.</i>

02:43.625 --> 02:45.667
Mark Lee Gardner:
<i> The United States government</i>
<i> wanted the Black Hills,</i>

02:45.667 --> 02:47.291
<i> merchants wanted</i>
<i> the Black Hills,</i>

02:47.291 --> 02:49.250
<i> gold seekers</i>
<i> wanted the Black Hills.</i>

02:49.250 --> 02:52.166
They had a treaty.
They couldn't just take
the Black Hills.

02:54.333 --> 02:57.208
Narrator:
<i> Maintaining a peaceful</i>
<i> relationship with the Indians</i>

02:57.208 --> 02:59.500
<i> has been one of Grant's</i>
<i> proudest achievements</i>

02:59.500 --> 03:01.333
<i> since taking office,</i>

03:01.333 --> 03:04.375
<i> and he knows that going back</i>
<i> on his peace policy</i>

03:04.375 --> 03:07.500
<i> would only reignite</i>
<i> the conflict.</i>

03:08.333 --> 03:09.667
<i> In a last-ditch effort</i>

03:09.667 --> 03:12.291
<i> to avoid all-out war</i>
<i> with the Indians,</i>

03:12.291 --> 03:14.875
<i> Grant proposes a deal.</i>

03:14.875 --> 03:17.750
<i> The government offers</i>
<i> to buy back the Black Hills</i>

03:17.750 --> 03:21.917
<i> from the Lakota Sioux</i>
<i> for six million dollars--</i>

03:21.917 --> 03:25.291
<i> $100 million</i>
<i> in today's money.</i>

03:37.458 --> 03:41.458
<i> Over 1,200 miles away</i>
<i> from Washington...</i>

03:43.458 --> 03:46.542
<i> word of the offer</i>
<i> soon reaches respected leader</i>

03:46.542 --> 03:49.667
<i> Sitting Bull...</i>

03:49.667 --> 03:53.542
( speaking Lakota
language )

03:53.583 --> 03:56.625
<i> ...who knows his people</i>
<i> now need to make a decision.</i>

04:02.834 --> 04:05.917
<i> He gathers a council</i>
<i> of Lakota leaders,</i>

04:05.917 --> 04:09.458
<i> including the fierce warrior</i>
<i> Crazy Horse.</i>

04:09.458 --> 04:11.959
Robert Redford:
<i> I think Native Americans'</i>
<i> relationship with the land</i>

04:11.959 --> 04:14.834
<i> was very tight</i>
<i> and had a spiritual component</i>

04:14.834 --> 04:16.875
<i> because they believed</i>
<i> that they were connected</i>

04:16.875 --> 04:19.333
<i> to the land,</i>
<i> they came from the land.</i>

04:19.333 --> 04:21.375
So they had
a very close relationship

04:21.375 --> 04:22.834
with the land,

04:22.834 --> 04:26.667
much more than people
from outside did,

04:26.667 --> 04:28.875
who looked at the land
in a more superficial way.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.500
( speaking Lakota language )

04:52.667 --> 04:55.001
Narrator:
<i> To the Lakota,</i>
<i> the Black Hills are more</i>

04:55.001 --> 04:57.792
<i> than just a place</i>
<i> to live and hunt--</i>

04:57.792 --> 05:00.917
<i> they're essential</i>
<i> to their culture.</i>

05:00.917 --> 05:03.792
The Black Hills is
important and sacred to us

05:03.792 --> 05:06.542
because that's where
our creation story comes from.

05:06.542 --> 05:08.959
<i> There's a place</i>
<i> called Wood Cave there</i>

05:08.959 --> 05:12.750
<i> that many of us believe</i>
<i> that's where we came from.</i>

05:12.750 --> 05:15.667
<i> We value the land</i>
<i> and the animals</i>

05:15.667 --> 05:17.667
<i> just as much</i>
<i> as we do people.</i>

05:17.667 --> 05:19.792
Gold had no meaning,
no value to us.

05:21.709 --> 05:23.709
Karl Jacoby:
<i> Of all the places</i>
<i> the United States</i>

05:23.709 --> 05:26.000
<i> could've wanted</i>
<i> the Lakota to sell...</i>

05:28.583 --> 05:30.458
<i> the Black Hills</i>
<i> were the worst place</i>

05:30.458 --> 05:32.458
<i> that they could've chosen.</i>

05:32.458 --> 05:34.959
<i> Sitting Bull famously</i>
<i>picks up a little pinch of dirt</i>

05:35.001 --> 05:36.542
and he holds it up,
and he says

05:36.542 --> 05:37.875
"I don't wanna sell
any more land,

05:37.875 --> 05:39.667
not even as much
as this little pinch of dirt."

05:49.959 --> 05:52.959
These just came in.

06:01.583 --> 06:04.834
Narrator:
<i> The Lakota Sioux reject</i>
<i> the government's offer,</i>

06:04.834 --> 06:08.458
<i> and Grant's hope for peace</i>
<i> is slipping away.</i>

06:11.000 --> 06:14.750
H.W. Brands:
<i> Grant sympathized with</i>
<i> the plight of the Indians.</i>

06:14.750 --> 06:17.500
<i> But he also understood</i>
<i>that he was losing that battle.</i>

06:17.500 --> 06:20.917
<i> He was losing the battle</i>
<i> with respect to Indian policy.</i>

06:20.917 --> 06:22.750
Ultimately, unless
the American people

06:22.750 --> 06:25.500
were gonna tolerate this,
it simply wouldn't stand.

06:28.917 --> 06:30.917
With all
due respect, sir,

06:30.917 --> 06:33.750
you have exhausted
every political option
available

06:33.750 --> 06:35.417
<i>in dealing</i>
<i>with the Sioux.</i>

06:35.417 --> 06:37.583
Our own people
are starving.

06:37.583 --> 06:39.583
It is no longer
a sustainable objective.

06:39.583 --> 06:42.750
It's time we start looking
at military options.

07:02.583 --> 07:05.875
Issue
a proclamation.

07:05.875 --> 07:07.542
All the members
of the Sioux tribe

07:07.542 --> 07:11.625
must report
to an appointed
Indian reservation

07:11.625 --> 07:15.667
no later than
February 1st, 1876.

07:17.041 --> 07:20.458
And those that
don't report?

07:20.458 --> 07:23.583
They will be
considered hostile

07:23.583 --> 07:25.709
and treated
as such.

07:35.792 --> 07:37.917
Narrator:
<i> After years of</i>
<i> trying to establish peace</i>

07:37.917 --> 07:39.792
<i> with the Indians,</i>

07:39.792 --> 07:42.875
<i> President Grant</i>
<i> is now provoking a war.</i>

07:44.625 --> 07:47.667
This was the administration's
way of defeating

07:47.667 --> 07:49.875
these uncooperative--
at least in their mind,

07:49.917 --> 07:52.500
uncooperative Indians

07:52.500 --> 07:55.709

You're a long way

09:26.125 --> 09:27.917
There are wanted men
in your area.

09:27.917 --> 09:29.166
Jesse and Frank James,

09:29.166 --> 09:31.583
they were spotted
nearby recently.

09:31.583 --> 09:34.834
- Is that right?
- Have you seen them?

09:34.834 --> 09:36.750
Afraid I can't
help you.

09:37.875 --> 09:40.959
Jesse and his brother

09:43.875 --> 09:45.834
I can't help ya.

09:45.834 --> 09:47.709
I'm staying at

Narrator:
<i> With no help</i>

09:59.792 --> 10:03.750
<i> Whicher needs another way</i>

<i> So he employs a tactic that</i>

Good day, sir.
How are ya?

10:37.750 --> 10:39.875
I wonder if you

10:39.875 --> 10:43.000
I'm a little new
to the area-- I was looking
for the James farmhouse?

10:47.083 --> 10:49.166
Gardner:
<i> It was very dangerous</i>

<i> this Northerner</i>
<i> from Chicago,</i>

Gardner:
<i> Jesse's mother,</i>
<i> Zerelda James,</i>

12:35.417 --> 12:38.333
<i> was outspoken, dominating.</i>

12:38.333 --> 12:41.333

I saw your crops

13:12.875 --> 13:15.333
Come on inside

13:23.917 --> 13:26.959
I remember the days when
no self-respecting white man

13:26.959 --> 13:29.500
would ever ask
for farmwork.

13:32.041 --> 13:34.375

- Sugar?
-<i> Yes, please.</i>

14:02.125 --> 14:04.208
Gardner:
<i> Joseph Whicher</i>

<i> And he was going out</i>

14:08.250 --> 14:10.500
as some guy looking for work
as a hired hand,

14:10.500 --> 14:13.333
and he just did not fit
that description.

14:14.417 --> 14:17.458
Are you any good
with a hammer?

14:17.458 --> 14:21.001
I have a barn out back
that needs some work.

14:21.001 --> 14:23.041
Sure thing, ma'am.

14:24.291 --> 14:26.083
Right this way.

14:42.125 --> 14:45.208

15:03.500 --> 15:05.125
( gasps )

15:07.250 --> 15:10.417
But we don't talk
to Northern spies.

15:14.291 --> 15:16.583
<i> ( Whicher gagging )</i>

15:46.041 --> 15:48.125
Narrator:
<i> Jesse James</i>
<i> and his brother Frank</i>

15:48.125 --> 15:51.458
<i> have just killed</i>
<i> top Pinkerton agent</i>

15:51.458 --> 15:53.625
<i> Joseph Whicher.</i>

15:53.625 --> 15:56.125
Gardner:
<i> They kill him</i>
<i> for a couple of reasons.</i>

15:56.125 --> 15:58.500
<i> They don't want anybody</i>
<i> with any knowledge</i>

15:58.500 --> 16:00.542
<i> of what Jesse looks like,</i>

16:00.542 --> 16:02.291
<i> but he wants</i>
<i> to send a message--</i>

16:02.291 --> 16:05.125
"Don't send these Northerners
from Chicago

16:05.125 --> 16:07.500
to intimidate me
and my family.

16:09.542 --> 16:12.041
<i> Stay out of my turf."</i>

16:14.208 --> 16:16.291
Narrator:
<i> As Jesse James claims</i>
<i> another victory</i>

16:16.291 --> 16:18.709
<i> in his personal war</i>
<i> against the North...</i>

16:21.417 --> 16:24.250
<i> nearly 1,000 miles away,</i>

16:24.250 --> 16:26.250
<i> the Lakota Sioux</i>
<i> have been given an ultimatum</i>

16:26.250 --> 16:29.083
<i> by the U.S. government--</i>

16:29.083 --> 16:32.208
<i> move onto a reservation</i>
<i> immediately...</i>

16:33.625 --> 16:36.417
<i> or risk war.</i>

16:39.291 --> 16:42.291
( speaking Lakota language )

17:09.208 --> 17:12.125
Narrator:
<i> Lakota leaders Sitting Bull</i>
<i> and Crazy Horse</i>

17:12.125 --> 17:16.166
<i> defy President Grant's order</i>
<i> to move onto reservations,</i>

17:16.166 --> 17:19.375
<i> knowing full well that they'll</i>
<i> now be considered enemies</i>

17:19.375 --> 17:21.667
<i> of the United States</i>
<i> Government.</i>

17:25.291 --> 17:28.083
In reality, they all
wanted the same thing,

17:28.083 --> 17:29.667
to protect their
women and children.

17:29.667 --> 17:32.166
<i> We never wanted</i>
<i> to fight anyone.</i>

17:32.166 --> 17:34.458
<i> But when the government</i>
<i> got involved</i>

17:34.458 --> 17:36.083
and the army came,

17:36.083 --> 17:38.583
then it just became
a right or wrong.

17:50.291 --> 17:52.291
Narrator:
<i> When President Grant learns</i>

17:52.291 --> 17:57.291
<i> of hostile Indians refusing</i>
<i> to move onto reservations,</i>

17:57.291 --> 18:00.625
<i> he has no choice</i>
<i> but to take action.</i>

18:05.667 --> 18:08.291
<i> He orders</i>
<i> General William T. Sherman</i>

18:08.291 --> 18:12.291
<i> to mobilize the U.S. Army</i>
<i> in the West,</i>

18:12.291 --> 18:15.458
<i> preparing for an attack</i>
<i> on the bands of Indians</i>

18:15.458 --> 18:18.625
<i> led by Sitting Bull</i>
<i> and Crazy Horse.</i>

18:25.417 --> 18:28.625
<i> But one man won't be</i>
<i> leading the charge this time.</i>

18:41.375 --> 18:44.333
<i> After announcing gold</i>
<i> in the Black Hills,</i>

18:44.333 --> 18:47.458
<i> George Armstrong Custer</i>

18:47.458 --> 18:50.542
<i> is barred from taking part</i>
<i> in the upcoming battle.</i>

18:52.500 --> 18:54.500
Brands:
<i> Grant eventually</i>
<i> came to conclude</i>

18:54.500 --> 18:57.250
that Custer thought
more about himself

18:57.250 --> 18:59.750
and the image that he cast
than about the mission

18:59.750 --> 19:04.333
or about the broader outline
of policy he was pursuing.

19:04.333 --> 19:06.583
<i> Eventually, Grant</i>
<i> just threw up his hands.</i>

19:06.583 --> 19:09.500
"There's nothing
I can do with Custer."

19:09.500 --> 19:12.458
Narrator:
<i> Left out of the campaign</i>
<i> against the Indians,</i>

19:12.458 --> 19:14.625
<i> Custer begins</i>
<i> to set his sights</i>

19:14.625 --> 19:18.250
<i> beyond his military career.</i>

19:19.834 --> 19:23.333
It is a pleasure
and a privilege
as usual.

19:23.333 --> 19:27.125
Narrator:
<i> As Grant's disastrous</i>
<i> second term nears its end,</i>

19:27.125 --> 19:28.792
<i> Custer sees an opening</i>

19:28.792 --> 19:32.667
<i>to advance his own</i>
<i>political ambitions.</i>

19:32.667 --> 19:35.667
<i> Using his celebrity,</i>
<i> Custer begins meeting</i>

19:35.667 --> 19:38.709
<i> with influential politicians</i>
<i> in Washington,</i>

19:38.750 --> 19:41.250
<i> forming powerful alliances</i>
<i> that could help him</i>

19:41.250 --> 19:44.208
<i> achieve his new goal</i>
<i> of becoming president.</i>

19:44.208 --> 19:46.583
A decorated war veteran
like myself

19:46.583 --> 19:49.417
might well be able to pull off
what you're planning.

19:49.417 --> 19:52.750
Brands:
<i> Custer had a following</i>
<i> all his own.</i>

19:52.750 --> 19:55.250
Members of Congress
would invite him to come speak

19:55.250 --> 19:58.208
and Custer would talk,
and he would persuade them.

19:58.208 --> 20:00.333
In some ways,
he had political clout

20:00.333 --> 20:01.834
that Grant
and Sherman didn't.

20:01.834 --> 20:05.709
Now, they both outranked him,
but Custer had a following.

20:14.417 --> 20:16.542
Narrator:
<i> But Custer is convinced</i>

20:16.542 --> 20:19.542
<i> that if he's going to secure</i>
<i> a presidential nomination,</i>

20:19.583 --> 20:23.250
<i> he's still missing</i>
<i> one thing--</i>

20:23.250 --> 20:26.250
<i> another big</i>
<i> military victory.</i>

20:44.750 --> 20:46.500
You draw
a picture of me?

20:46.500 --> 20:48.709
Look at that.

20:48.709 --> 20:50.834
Frank, come here.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.417
Look at this.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.375
Do you recognize
that face?

20:58.375 --> 21:02.375
Hey, man, I believe
that is to scale.

21:02.375 --> 21:03.625
( chuckles )

21:03.625 --> 21:05.500
That is perfect.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.625
Good job,
little brother.

21:07.625 --> 21:09.792
Narrator:
<i> After killing a top agent</i>

21:09.792 --> 21:11.750
<i> from the most powerful</i>
<i> detective agency</i>

21:11.750 --> 21:13.625
<i> in the country,</i>

21:13.625 --> 21:16.375
<i> Jesse James</i>
<i> and his brother Frank</i>

21:16.375 --> 21:19.291
<i> go back to life</i>
<i> as usual.</i>

21:19.291 --> 21:20.500
Uh-oh.

21:20.500 --> 21:23.500
Why am I frownin'
and you smilin'?

21:23.500 --> 21:25.667
I guess that is
pretty accurate.

21:40.834 --> 21:41.959
<i> ( door opens )</i>

21:42.917 --> 21:44.375
Thank you.

21:45.917 --> 21:47.458
<i> ( door closes )</i>

22:16.375 --> 22:17.750
Narrator:
<i> For Allan Pinkerton,</i>

22:17.750 --> 22:20.083
<i> the brutal murder</i>
<i> of his top agent</i>

22:20.083 --> 22:22.500
<i> has turned his hunt</i>
<i> for Jesse James</i>

22:22.500 --> 22:26.083
<i> into a personal mission</i>
<i> for revenge.</i>

22:26.083 --> 22:27.792
Eisenbach:
<i> Jesse James is a symbol</i>

22:27.792 --> 22:29.792
<i> of everything the Pinkertons</i>
<i> are against--</i>

22:29.792 --> 22:34.500
lawlessness, unredeemed
Southern insurrectionism.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.834
<i> If Jesse James</i>
<i> was still out there</i>

22:36.834 --> 22:39.709
<i> as a symbol that you</i>
<i> can get away with this stuff,</i>

22:39.709 --> 22:42.333
<i> he had to be killed.</i>

22:42.375 --> 22:45.834
Pinkerton:
<i> If we can get</i>
<i> to this area here,</i>

22:45.834 --> 22:48.583
the mother's farmhouse--

22:48.583 --> 22:51.375
they all live there
together--

22:51.375 --> 22:54.083
<i> we'll stage</i>
<i> the final raid.</i>

22:55.709 --> 22:58.083
Narrator:
<i> As a private</i>
<i> enforcement agency,</i>

22:58.083 --> 23:00.083
<i> the Pinkertons</i>
<i> are able to operate</i>

23:00.083 --> 23:02.750
<i> outside the limits</i>
<i> of the law.</i>

23:02.750 --> 23:06.750
Once everything's in place,
we'll drive them from the house

23:06.750 --> 23:11.000
with this-- a fire bomb.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.583
A gift from an old Army friend
at the Rock Island Arsenal.

23:17.417 --> 23:18.625
<i> We flush them out,</i>

23:18.625 --> 23:21.792
and we take them down,
all of them.

23:21.792 --> 23:24.625
Shoot to kill.

23:26.041 --> 23:28.458
Kiefer Sutherland:
<i>In many cases if you look back,</i>

23:28.458 --> 23:31.750
a lot of people
that implemented law and order

23:31.750 --> 23:34.417
were, in some cases,
just as bad

23:34.417 --> 23:37.625
as the criminal element
themselves.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.583
We're gonna burn
that damn house down.

23:40.625 --> 23:43.667
Wipe it from
the face of the earth.

23:43.667 --> 23:45.625
<i> Do I make myself clear?</i>

23:45.625 --> 23:47.625
Detectives:
<i> Yes, sir.</i>

23:47.625 --> 23:49.166
Sutherland:
<i> That defining line</i>

23:49.166 --> 23:52.417
<i> between a lawman</i>
<i> and a criminal,</i>

23:52.417 --> 23:54.417
I think
is much more blurred

23:54.417 --> 23:57.041
<i> in the times</i>
<i> of the James Gang.</i>

24:12.667 --> 24:14.834
<i> ( crickets chirping )</i>

24:19.792 --> 24:23.667
Narrator:
<i> A group of Pinkerton agents</i>
<i> surround the James family home</i>

24:23.667 --> 24:25.959
<i> after Jesse and Frank</i>
<i> were spotted there</i>

24:25.959 --> 24:28.208
<i> earlier in the day.</i>

24:29.959 --> 24:32.000
Gardner:
<i> Pinkerton knew</i>
<i> that the James boys</i>

24:32.000 --> 24:35.041
would at some point
come to that house.

24:37.959 --> 24:41.083
<i> He had men ready,</i>
<i> at least eight to ten.</i>

24:41.083 --> 24:44.500
Whenever they learned
that Jesse and Frank
were at that farm,

24:44.500 --> 24:46.709
<i> he was gonna send</i>
<i> those men in.</i>

24:49.166 --> 24:51.709
What are we
waitin' for?

24:53.667 --> 24:56.667
Allan Pinkerton plotted
to bring about

24:56.667 --> 24:58.750
the demise
of the James brothers.

25:05.959 --> 25:08.709
<i> His instructions</i>
<i> were not just to attack</i>

25:08.709 --> 25:11.750
or kill
or capture Jesse.

25:11.750 --> 25:14.834
His instructions were to burn
that house to the ground.

25:16.208 --> 25:18.083
( clatters )

25:18.083 --> 25:20.500
( fizzling )

25:21.500 --> 25:22.959
Archie, get back!

25:53.166 --> 25:54.750
Narrator:
<i> A late-night attack</i>

25:54.750 --> 25:58.001
<i> ordered by</i>
<i> Detective Allan Pinkerton</i>

25:58.001 --> 26:02.041
<i> has destroyed the family farm</i>
<i> of Jesse James.</i>

26:06.542 --> 26:10.250
<i> But the intended targets</i>
<i> are miles away.</i>

26:17.583 --> 26:20.917
All right, boys,
I want to go over this
one more time.

26:22.208 --> 26:24.250
We're gonna start--

26:26.291 --> 26:28.625
Damn it, Frank.

26:28.625 --> 26:30.667
What the hell
took you so long?

26:42.875 --> 26:45.792
Them Pinkertons
came by Mama's.

26:47.959 --> 26:50.834
<i> She's hurt.</i>

26:53.917 --> 26:56.083
Archie's dead.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.333
( screams )

27:29.917 --> 27:31.959
Gardner:
<i> The Pinkerton men</i>
<i> threw this fireball</i>

27:31.959 --> 27:33.917
<i> into the James family home.</i>

27:33.959 --> 27:35.166
It exploded.

27:35.166 --> 27:37.667
It rips off
part of Zerelda's arm.

27:37.667 --> 27:41.166
It sends a fragment into
the stomach of little Archie,

27:41.166 --> 27:43.208
<i> the half brother,</i>
<i> who's only eight years old.</i>

27:43.208 --> 27:44.959
<i> It's a mortal wound.</i>

27:45.001 --> 27:47.166
<i> Jesse James, who really</i>
<i> is already angry,</i>

27:47.166 --> 27:49.250
<i> he's angrier now</i>
<i> at the Pinkertons,</i>

27:49.250 --> 27:53.917
who he sees
as representing Northern
tyranny and oppressors.

27:56.041 --> 28:01.001
<i> So this gives Jesse</i>
<i> even more cause to</i>
<i> seek revenge.</i>

28:04.250 --> 28:08.001
Narrator:
<i> Five hundred miles away</i>
<i> in the heart of the West,</i>

28:08.000 --> 28:10.917
<i> another conflict</i>
<i> is escalating.</i>

28:20.750 --> 28:23.125
<i> Led by their chief,</i>
<i> Sitting Bull,</i>

28:23.125 --> 28:26.125
<i> many Lakota have defied</i>
<i> President Grant's order</i>

28:26.125 --> 28:29.001
<i> to report to a reservation.</i>

28:31.208 --> 28:33.834
<i> Sitting Bull knows</i>
<i> Grant will see his actions</i>

28:33.875 --> 28:36.792
<i> as a declaration of war,</i>

28:36.792 --> 28:40.001
<i> so he begins building</i>
<i> a unified war party,</i>

28:40.001 --> 28:43.166
<i> gathering tribes</i>
<i> from across the West.</i>

28:46.875 --> 28:48.917
Pourier:
<i> At first it was</i>
<i> individual tribes</i>

28:48.917 --> 28:52.041
that were protecting themselves
against the government.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.917
<i> But, you know,</i>
<i> at some point</i>

28:55.917 --> 28:57.959
they figure out, "Okay,
we gotta work together now."

29:00.041 --> 29:02.125
Narrator:
<i> Nearly 4,000 warriors</i>

29:02.125 --> 29:05.208
<i> from tribes like the Cheyenne</i>
<i> and the Arapaho</i>

29:05.208 --> 29:09.083
<i> flock from Kansas,</i>
<i> Colorado, Nebraska,</i>

29:09.083 --> 29:11.750
<i> and the Wyoming Territory</i>

29:11.750 --> 29:14.834
<i> to band together</i>
<i> at the Little Bighorn River.</i>

29:16.291 --> 29:18.375
<i> It's the largest</i>
<i> Indian force</i>

29:18.375 --> 29:20.959
<i> the U.S. Army</i>
<i> has ever seen.</i>

29:23.166 --> 29:27.001
( quacking )

29:27.001 --> 29:30.417
Sherman:
Our reports indicate
that around 1,000 Indian lodges

29:30.417 --> 29:32.792
are based here.

29:32.792 --> 29:35.083
We deploy Custer 1,200 men

29:35.125 --> 29:37.000
to track down
whatever remains

29:37.000 --> 29:39.250
of Crazy Horse
and Sitting Bull's war party.

29:39.250 --> 29:41.208
And if necessary,
wipe them out.

29:41.208 --> 29:43.375
Custer?

29:44.291 --> 29:48.041
He has proven that he can
take on these savages and win.

29:48.041 --> 29:50.208
He's our
best option.

29:55.834 --> 29:58.917
Have Custer report to
General Terry at Bismarck.

30:04.250 --> 30:06.291
Eisenbach:
<i> Grant thought Custer</i>
<i> was a complete hothead.</i>

30:06.291 --> 30:08.083
He was a loose cannon.

30:08.083 --> 30:10.792
He wasn't the military guy
that Grant liked,

30:10.792 --> 30:12.750
which was somebody
who just followed orders.

30:12.750 --> 30:16.041
<i> But there's</i>
<i> this popular outcry</i>

30:16.041 --> 30:18.250
to get Grant
to reinstate Custer

30:18.250 --> 30:21.125
for the big push
into the Black Hills.

30:27.834 --> 30:30.959
Narrator:
<i> After months of building</i>
<i> his political connections,</i>

30:30.959 --> 30:35.166
<i> Custer is sent west</i>
<i> to the Montana Territory</i>

<i> to lead a regiment</i>
<i> against one of the largest</i>
<i> Indian war parties</i>

30:38.375 --> 30:41.083
<i> ever assembled in the U.S.,</i>

30:41.083 --> 30:44.208
<i> giving him the opportunity</i>
<i> that could carry him</i>

30:44.208 --> 30:46.834
<i> all the way</i>
<i> to the White House.</i>

30:49.792 --> 30:51.417
Paul Hutton:
<i> Custer was ambitious.</i>

30:51.417 --> 30:53.917
<i> He had great dreams,</i>
<i> he had the American dream.</i>

30:53.917 --> 30:55.917
There's been talk
that Custer hoped to get

30:55.917 --> 30:59.291
the Democratic nomination
for president.

30:59.291 --> 31:02.834
He needs a big victory
to win glory once again

31:02.834 --> 31:06.166
and, of course,
move onward and upward.

31:28.917 --> 31:33.000
Narrator:
<i> After a botched raid has left</i>
<i> his young brother dead,</i>

Eisenbach:

as, like,
the ultimate evil--

31:42.166 --> 31:45.959
guys who are breaking
constitutional law

31:45.959 --> 31:48.333
<i> in the interest</i>
<i> of big business.</i>

31:57.333 --> 31:59.375
Narrator:
<i> As news of the raid</i>
<i> on the James' home</i>

31:59.375 --> 32:01.500
<i> spreads throughout</i>
<i> Missouri,</i>

32:01.500 --> 32:05.166
<i> one man sees an opportunity</i>
<i> to use the tragedy</i>

32:05.166 --> 32:08.500
<i> to rally the South together</i>
<i> for the Confederate cause.</i>

32:10.250 --> 32:13.083
I want to run
this front page tomorrow.

32:15.166 --> 32:17.208
"Men from Missouri...

32:19.375 --> 32:22.333
who fought
under Anderson...

32:23.959 --> 32:26.125
it is not because
of the robberies

32:26.125 --> 32:27.917
for which
they are accused.

32:30.001 --> 32:34.125
It is because,
like you,

32:34.125 --> 32:37.500
<i> they</i> fought
for the South.

32:37.500 --> 32:40.166
Narrator:
<i> Newspaper editor</i>
<i> John Newman Edwards</i>

32:40.166 --> 32:42.458
<i> frames the story</i>
<i> of Pinkerton's raid</i>

32:42.458 --> 32:45.041
<i> as a direct attack</i>
<i> on the South</i>

32:45.041 --> 32:47.041
<i> by a Northern enemy.</i>

32:47.083 --> 32:48.542
Gardner:
<i> The Pinkerton raid</i>

32:48.583 --> 32:52.500
<i> turns all kinds of sympathy</i>
<i> to the James family.</i>

32:52.500 --> 32:55.500
<i> They already</i>
<i> had a little sympathy</i>
<i> from Southerners.</i>

32:55.500 --> 32:58.250
But now they see
an eight-year-old boy
has been killed,

32:58.291 --> 33:00.583
<i> a mother</i>
<i> has lost her child,</i>

33:00.583 --> 33:05.041
<i> so the press, including</i>
<i> John Newman Edwards,</i>
<i> have a field day</i>

33:05.041 --> 33:08.375
<i> over what this</i>
<i> Chicago private firm has done</i>

33:08.375 --> 33:11.333
<i> here in Clay County,</i>
<i> Missouri.</i>

33:11.333 --> 33:14.166
Narrator:
<i> The articles appeal</i>
<i> to loyal southerners</i>

33:14.166 --> 33:16.417
<i> and support for</i>
<i> Jesse James and his cause</i>

33:16.417 --> 33:19.250
<i> is at an all-time high.</i>

33:19.250 --> 33:21.041
<i> To show their support,</i>

33:21.041 --> 33:23.667
<i> Missouri residents</i>
<i> give Edwards and his newspaper</i>

33:23.667 --> 33:27.542
<i> the names of anyone who</i>
<i> may have aided the Pinkertons</i>

33:27.542 --> 33:30.208
<i> for him to print</i>
<i> in his paper.</i>

33:30.208 --> 33:34.250
<i> And it isn't long</i>
<i> before Jesse tracks them down.</i>

33:34.250 --> 33:37.250
Gardner:
<i> One man who's revealed</i>
<i> to have helped Pinkerton</i>

33:37.291 --> 33:40.083
<i> was Daniel Askew.</i>

33:40.083 --> 33:43.166
Pinkerton had a man there
acting as a hired hand

33:43.166 --> 33:46.417
<i> keeping watch</i>
<i> on the house.</i>

33:46.417 --> 33:50.250
Daniel Askew makes the mistake
of not leaving Clay County.

33:55.208 --> 33:58.250
( laughing )

34:05.125 --> 34:07.250
Woman:
Can you fetch us
some water for the dishes?

34:28.333 --> 34:30.250
Daniel Askew.

34:34.166 --> 34:35.583
Do you know who I am?

34:38.125 --> 34:41.667
- Yes.
- That's good.

34:47.625 --> 34:51.500
<i>That seems</i>
<i>like a nice family</i>
<i>you got in there.</i>

34:51.500 --> 34:52.709
Please.

34:54.542 --> 34:55.792
Please what?

34:58.291 --> 34:59.625
Whatever you do,

34:59.625 --> 35:04.458
just please don't
hurt my family.

35:04.458 --> 35:07.291
That'd be--

35:07.291 --> 35:09.750
that'd be pretty low,
wouldn't it,

35:09.750 --> 35:11.792
murder innocent women
and children?

35:13.625 --> 35:17.166
Yeah, I don't know
if I could stoop to
something like that.

35:17.166 --> 35:20.625
- But I guess, uh...
- ( clicks )

35:20.625 --> 35:23.208
...you're gonna have to
take me at my word.

35:34.291 --> 35:36.250
Gardner:
<i> No one is ever brought</i>
<i> to trial</i>

35:36.250 --> 35:39.125
<i> for the murder</i>
<i> of Jesse's half brother,</i>

35:39.125 --> 35:41.500
which, again,
gives Jesse a reason

35:41.500 --> 35:43.542
to seek his own justice.

35:46.709 --> 35:49.500
<i> If the law is not gonna bring</i>
<i> these guys to justice,</i>

35:49.500 --> 35:51.500
then Jesse's gonna do
what<i> he</i> can.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.250
Narrator:
<i> Five hundred miles away,</i>

36:10.291 --> 36:12.291
<i> Allan Pinkerton</i>
<i> is dealing with the fallout</i>

36:12.291 --> 36:15.458
<i> from his botched raid.</i>

36:15.458 --> 36:18.500
It was Allan Pinkerton's
greatest defeat,

36:18.500 --> 36:20.291
his greatest humiliation.

36:21.500 --> 36:22.750
Narrator:
<i> Pinkerton's reputation</i>

36:22.750 --> 36:27.500
<i> for relentless justice</i>
<i> is ruined.</i>

36:27.500 --> 36:30.208
<i> And he's forced</i>
<i> to back away from the outlaw</i>

36:30.208 --> 36:34.500
<i> he's been pursuing</i>
<i> for the past year,</i>

36:34.500 --> 36:38.250
<i> giving up on Jesse James</i>
<i> for good.</i>

37:00.417 --> 37:02.500
General,
we found them.

37:03.417 --> 37:04.625
Where?

37:04.625 --> 37:07.375
Camped along
Little Bighorn.

37:08.667 --> 37:10.333
Good job,
soldier.

37:11.709 --> 37:13.250
Hyah!

37:15.500 --> 37:18.792
Narrator:
<i> In hopes of securing</i>
<i> a presidential nomination,</i>

37:18.792 --> 37:22.250
<i> George Armstrong Custer</i>
<i> is on a mission</i>

37:22.250 --> 37:26.834
<i> to track down and defeat</i>
<i> a band of Sioux Indians.</i>

37:26.834 --> 37:30.709
<i> Custer's leading</i>
<i> one of three columns</i>
<i> of U.S. troops</i>

37:30.709 --> 37:33.583
<i> heading toward battle</i>
<i> against Sitting Bull.</i>

37:33.583 --> 37:36.458
The campaign
on the Northern Plains in 1876

37:36.458 --> 37:38.333
is one of the largest

37:38.333 --> 37:42.417
<i> the army had ever engaged in</i>
<i> in the Indian Wars.</i>

37:42.417 --> 37:44.417
<i> Three great columns</i>
<i> went forward--</i>

37:44.417 --> 37:46.417
<i> one coming up</i>
<i> from the South,</i>

37:46.417 --> 37:48.417
<i> another coming out</i>
<i> of Montana,</i>

37:48.417 --> 37:49.750
<i> and then Custer's column</i>

37:49.750 --> 37:52.583
<i> coming from</i>
<i> Fort Abraham Lincoln.</i>

37:54.500 --> 37:56.458
Narrator:
<i> Together the battalions</i>
<i> make up a force</i>

37:56.458 --> 37:59.417
<i> of nearly 1,500 troops...</i>

37:59.417 --> 38:01.291
<i> with one goal in mind--</i>

38:01.291 --> 38:03.917
<i> to destroy</i>
<i> Sitting Bull's army.</i>

38:09.333 --> 38:11.834
<i> But what the commanders</i>
<i> don't realize</i>

38:11.834 --> 38:14.291
<i> is that Lakota chief</i>
<i> Sitting Bull</i>

38:14.291 --> 38:17.583
<i> has gathered nearly</i>
<i> 4,000 Indian fighters...</i>

38:21.333 --> 38:24.417
<i> including the fearless warrior</i>
<i> Crazy Horse.</i>

38:31.792 --> 38:35.500
<i> After hearing reports that</i>
<i> the U.S. Army is closing in,</i>

38:35.500 --> 38:38.750
<i> Sitting Bull calls together</i>
<i> other Lakota leaders</i>

38:38.750 --> 38:42.333
<i> and tells them of</i>
<i> a powerful vision he's had.</i>

38:42.333 --> 38:43.834
Pourier:
<i> There's certain ceremonies</i>

38:43.834 --> 38:45.583
<i> where you go</i>
<i> without food and water,</i>

38:45.625 --> 38:47.542
<i> sometimes for four days.</i>

38:47.542 --> 38:50.834
During those times because of
what your body's going through,

38:50.834 --> 38:53.458
people call it a vision

38:53.458 --> 38:55.625
<i> and because Sitting Bull</i>
<i> is the chief,</i>

38:55.625 --> 38:57.667
<i> a medicine man,</i>
<i> and a healer,</i>

38:57.667 --> 39:00.667
his vision we all agreed
and honored and respected.

39:05.625 --> 39:08.667
( speaking Lakota language )

39:52.417 --> 39:54.750
Pourier:
<i> He knew they were gonna win.</i>

39:54.750 --> 39:56.709
<i> That's a powerful thing</i>
<i> to know,</i>

39:56.709 --> 39:58.542
it's a powerful faith
to have.

40:13.792 --> 40:16.001
Where can we
cross the river?

40:16.001 --> 40:18.750
Down south here.
Up here, further north.

40:19.875 --> 40:21.792
How many warriors?

40:21.792 --> 40:24.375
I've never seen
a gathering
this large.

40:24.375 --> 40:27.500
<i>Sitting Bull's tribe,</i>
<i>Crazy Horse's, too.</i>

40:27.500 --> 40:29.959
<i>Also Arapaho,</i>
<i>Cheyenne.</i>

40:31.417 --> 40:32.917
Do they know
we're here?

40:32.917 --> 40:35.458
I don't think so.

40:36.834 --> 40:39.625
One hour.
Get the men ready.

40:41.041 --> 40:44.959
I will not let
Sitting Bull slip
through my fingers.

40:44.959 --> 40:46.959
Yes, sir.

40:55.041 --> 40:57.458
Narrator:
<i> Instead of waiting</i>
<i> for the remaining</i>

40:57.458 --> 41:00.417
<i> two columns of U.S. troops</i>
<i> to arrive,</i>

41:00.417 --> 41:02.500
<i> Custer orders his regiment</i>

41:02.500 --> 41:06.458
<i> of just under 500 men</i>
<i> to move out.</i>

41:06.458 --> 41:10.959
<i> He leaves all</i>
<i> his heavy artillery behind,</i>

41:10.959 --> 41:13.583
<i> determined to get</i>
<i> all the glory</i>

41:13.583 --> 41:17.625
<i> for defeating Sitting Bull</i>
<i> and his warriors.</i>

41:17.625 --> 41:20.792
Eisenbach:
<i> Custer is a very</i>
<i> ambitious man.</i>

41:20.792 --> 41:23.709
He thinks if he goes up there,
eliminates the Indians,

41:23.709 --> 41:26.959
the windfall of all that gold
comes into the economy,

41:26.959 --> 41:29.709
everybody sees him
as a great hero

41:29.709 --> 41:31.834
who bailed out
the federal government

41:31.834 --> 41:34.625
<i> and now he can</i>
<i> position himself</i>

41:34.625 --> 41:37.792
<i> to become</i>
<i> the commander-in-chief.</i>

41:39.875 --> 41:43.750
"President Custer"--
just think about that.

41:49.583 --> 41:51.625
Narrator:
<i> As Custer rides out,</i>

41:51.625 --> 41:53.917
<i> the Indians</i>
<i> prepare for battle,</i>

41:53.917 --> 41:57.875
<i> determined to fight</i>
<i> for their people's survival.</i>

41:57.875 --> 41:59.959
Jacoby:
<i> They're defending</i>
<i> their territory,</i>

41:59.959 --> 42:01.625
but they're also
more immediately

42:01.625 --> 42:03.625
defending their families.

42:03.625 --> 42:05.083
<i> They're trying to protect</i>
<i> all of them</i>

42:05.083 --> 42:06.959
<i> from the United States.</i>
