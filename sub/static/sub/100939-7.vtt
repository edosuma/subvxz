(lock clanks, buzzes)

(lock buzzes)

02:10.922 --> 02:12.757
(camera shutter clicking)

02:20.974 --> 02:22.892
Where are they thinking?

02:22.976 --> 02:24.394
Uh...

02:25.812 --> 02:27.772
There.

02:27.856 --> 02:32.610
But there was also
a noose there.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.612
How would he do it there?

02:34.696 --> 02:36.739
Supposedly, leaning forward.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.783
He was using his weight.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.368
How do they not know

02:40.451 --> 02:42.412
if he hung himself
from the window or the bed?

02:42.495 --> 02:45.415
Well, because there were nooses
in both places.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.041
What nooses?

02:47.125 --> 02:49.878
Well, he-he made them
from bedsheets.

02:49.961 --> 02:53.882
A guard cut him free
and tried to revive him.

02:53.965 --> 02:57.594
-And the guard can't tell us?
-He's being prosecuted.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.101
LIZ:
Can we... can we get
a photo of that?

03:05.184 --> 03:06.978
-GUARD: Sure.
-NIKO: They're lying!

03:08.521 --> 03:10.607
-They're all lying.
-Shut up.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.150
Back away.

03:12.233 --> 03:15.653
-How many prisoners per cell?
-WILBUR: Two...

03:15.737 --> 03:17.947
in the Special Housing Unit.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.450
But no one in that cell?

03:20.533 --> 03:21.367
WILBUR:
Correct.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.162
And when was
the second prisoner removed?

03:24.245 --> 03:25.914
-The day before.
-Why?

03:25.997 --> 03:27.665
He was released.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.960
(chuckles) This prison
is massively overcrowded?

03:31.044 --> 03:34.380
-Mm.
-And no one was put
in that cell?

03:35.381 --> 03:37.133
So he was on suicide watch,

03:37.216 --> 03:39.677
but he was allowed to be
in that cell by himself?

03:39.761 --> 03:41.763
He was taken off watch
a week later.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.768
And that video camera, that's
the one that wasn't working?

03:46.851 --> 03:48.853
-Yes.
-And we don't know why?

03:50.229 --> 03:52.148
But there was
another video camera?

03:52.231 --> 03:53.650
Yes.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.820
LIZ:
But you don't have the footage

03:57.904 --> 03:59.614
-from this one?
-No.

03:59.697 --> 04:03.034
But Bill Barr has reviewed it,
and he saw nothing unusual.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.745
No one entering the SHU
or exiting.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.956
-The attorney general saw this?
-Yes.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.791
But we can't see it?

04:09.874 --> 04:12.377
It wasn't made available
to my department.

04:12.460 --> 04:15.129
You're the U.S. attorney, and it
wasn't made available to you?

04:15.213 --> 04:16.714
Yes.

04:16.798 --> 04:21.344
Look, Liz, that's why
I need you to review this.

04:24.430 --> 04:27.809
We thought that the media
attention would die down,

04:27.892 --> 04:31.980
but it's been nine months,
and the reporters keep calling

04:32.063 --> 04:34.691
and asking,
"Did he kill himself,

04:34.774 --> 04:37.026
or was Jeffrey Epstein
murdered?"

04:37.110 --> 04:39.195
So, why me?

04:39.278 --> 04:40.863
-We're objective.
-WILBUR: That's right.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.533
I need my own Warren Commission.

04:43.616 --> 04:47.996
This is a printout
of Epstein's little black book.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.373
It has every name
of every lawyer

04:50.456 --> 04:52.542
worth his salt in New York.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.003
You worked for me in Chicago.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.171
-You pushed me out in Chicago.
-Yes, but I remember

04:57.255 --> 04:59.549
you came to me five years ago
and you told me,

04:59.632 --> 05:01.551
"We should arrest
Jeffrey Epstein."

05:01.634 --> 05:04.929
You wanted to investigate
his sexual transporting

05:05.013 --> 05:06.681
of underage girls.

05:06.764 --> 05:08.266
You were ahead of all of us.

05:08.349 --> 05:12.061
You kept saying,
"We need to protect the girls,"

05:12.145 --> 05:14.897
and I said,
"No, he's too connected."

05:14.981 --> 05:17.942
Well, here's our chance
to correct that.

05:18.026 --> 05:21.571
-Yeah, well, it's a little late.
-You do a good job here, Liz,

05:21.654 --> 05:23.948
I can imply but not promise

05:24.032 --> 05:26.451
that there could be other work
for your firm.

05:26.534 --> 05:27.994
A lot of work.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.250
Epstein died in this cell.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.545
Did he commit suicide,
or was he murdered?

05:37.628 --> 05:40.256
You have a budget of $400,000,

05:40.339 --> 05:44.135
and 133,000 pages of evidence.

05:44.218 --> 05:46.721
And if I decide
that he was murdered?

05:46.804 --> 05:48.806
-I won't censor you.
-Even if I find out

05:48.890 --> 05:50.808
that it was done
by powerful people?

05:50.892 --> 05:53.269
Follow the evidence
wherever it takes you.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.438
I need outside-the-box thinking.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.273
-How long do I have?
-Two weeks.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.650
-(sighs)
-Brief me in a week,
I'll get you more time.

05:59.734 --> 06:02.278
But I need something.

06:02.361 --> 06:05.198
Something 60 Minutes
doesn't have.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.159
All right, you...

06:08.242 --> 06:09.994
You told me that I could
interview somebody

06:10.078 --> 06:11.245
who knew Epstein in prison?

06:11.329 --> 06:12.830
Yes. This way.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.749
No, no, no, no. I want him.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.834
GUARD:
No. That's Niko.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.462
-He's a liar.
-Yeah, it's better if you
talk to someone else.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.089
Was Niko there that night?

06:22.799 --> 06:25.426
Then-then I want to talk to him.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.845
(muffled): He used to stand
just inside that door.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.472
We talked a lot.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.933
He gave me investment advice
about index funds

06:32.016 --> 06:33.559
that I'm definitely
going to follow.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.270
Do you remember anything
about the night that he died?

06:38.231 --> 06:40.399
He was kind of chatty
that night, said he, uh,

06:40.483 --> 06:43.653
had doubts about the Jets'
starting quarterback.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.197
And then he said
something weird.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.992
He said, right before
he was arrested, on his jet,

06:50.076 --> 06:52.370
he took care of
the most important thing.

06:53.412 --> 06:55.331
What was that?

06:56.415 --> 06:58.334
I have no idea.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.844
Any idea what this is about?

07:07.927 --> 07:09.512
Nope.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.223
But an unscheduled
midweek meeting?

07:12.306 --> 07:14.142
(chuckles):
Never good.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.643
The coffee's better up here,
though, huh?

07:15.726 --> 07:17.687
-Mm.
-(laughs)

07:17.770 --> 07:20.982
Ah, good morning. Thank you
for starting your day with me.

07:21.065 --> 07:23.192
I will make this quick.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.362
You are the heads of all
of our major departments,

07:26.445 --> 07:29.407
and you're doing an amazing job.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.284
-(scattered applause)
-That... Yes.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.536
Yes. Applause. Indeed, indeed.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.872
Well-deserved. Worth it.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.833
I have very good news
for everyone.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.209
-Here it comes.
-One of the reasons

07:40.293 --> 07:42.670
for these mergers is the great

07:42.753 --> 07:44.881
opportunity for synergy.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.383
It gives us the-the chance
to hone our operations,

07:47.466 --> 07:51.762
to create greater communication,
to maximize profits.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.223
I mean, y-you carefully sand
a piece of wood

07:54.307 --> 07:56.058
in order to reduce
the chance of slivers.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.894
Now, as department heads,

07:57.977 --> 08:00.897
I want you to take a look at
your lawyers and associates,

08:00.980 --> 08:04.692
and then I want you to come
back to me with suggestions

08:04.775 --> 08:07.195
for reductions of 20%.

08:07.278 --> 08:10.406
We've made copies
of your personnel lists.

08:10.489 --> 08:12.074
Just go through them.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.951
Put an "X" next to

08:14.035 --> 08:16.913
whoever you think
we might be able to reduce.

08:16.996 --> 08:20.416
We will handle notification,
severance packages and the like.

08:20.499 --> 08:23.044
Now, look, there are
exciting days ahead.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.754
Let us remember
the words of the master:

08:24.837 --> 08:27.423
"Only when we are soft
and pliable

08:27.506 --> 08:30.593
can we be hard and strong."

08:32.637 --> 08:34.138
You're dictating
our staffing levels.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.765
I don't consider it dictating.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.767
-What do you consider it?
-Stewardship.

08:37.850 --> 08:41.479
Which, by the way, significantly
increases all our incomes.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.439
Except for the people
who are fired.

08:43.522 --> 08:45.900
You can't force us to lay off
20% of our employees.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.653
-How do you figure?
-Because we agreed
that for the first year,

08:48.736 --> 08:51.197
we would be allowed
to supervise our own shop.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.950
-It's in our contract.
-And you are.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.619
I'm not telling you
who to let go.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.454
Just put an "X" by their name.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.748
We'll take care
of the rest of it.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.541
♪ ♪

09:09.507 --> 09:11.384
There are so many files
to go through here.

09:11.467 --> 09:12.927
This is just
the first truckload.

09:13.010 --> 09:13.970
We're gonna be at this
for weeks.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.806
We're gonna need a system
to get this organized.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.266
Who wrote all these reports?

09:18.349 --> 09:19.976
Oh, there it is. All right.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.270
Okay, let's put the... let's put
the medical evidence here,

09:22.353 --> 09:23.854
we'll put the correspondence
here, and let's put

09:23.938 --> 09:25.815
the interviews
with the prison officials here.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.191
I've never worked on
a case this famous before.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.318
-I know, right?
-This is criminal charges

09:29.402 --> 09:31.487
-and victims' accounts?
-LIZ: Okay, why don't you get

09:31.570 --> 09:33.614
a team of three
and go through all of that?

09:33.698 --> 09:35.283
Okay, look, find any evidence

09:35.366 --> 09:38.160
that argues for murder
or suicide, you put it here.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.288
Murder. He was killed
by the Trumps.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.081
-KEVIN: Oh, come on.
-You blame everything
on the Trumps.

09:42.164 --> 09:45.001
Nobody in Trumpland is organized
enough to pull this off.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.003
-KEVIN: Why not the Clintons?
-MICAH: You sound like
right-wing talk radio.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.170
Bill was on
the Lolita Express, too.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.338
LIZ:
Hey! Wait, no.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.008
No. No conspiracy theories,

09:52.091 --> 09:53.843
no... no insane charges.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.679
Everything we do, we need
evidence, so let's start here.

09:56.762 --> 10:00.349
Epstein was a middle-aged
white man.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.685
That is the demographic
most likely to die by suicide.

10:02.768 --> 10:05.521
It says here suicide rate
in pretrial jails

10:05.604 --> 10:07.565
is three times higher
than in other prisons.

10:07.648 --> 10:10.359
Yes, but the last suicide
in that jail was 21 years ago.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.028
It was unusual.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.529
LIZ:
Yeah, but Epstein knew
that he was going

10:13.612 --> 10:15.364
to prison for the rest
of his life.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.158
So let's not rule out
the simplest explanation.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.617
ROSALYN:
Actually, there are
two autopsy reports.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.328
One by a private examiner.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.038
-Paid for by the family?
-So?

10:22.121 --> 10:24.373
Maybe he's just telling them
what they want to hear.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.000
He thinks that
Epstein's injuries

10:26.083 --> 10:27.543
are more consistent
with homicide.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.045
Broken blood vessels
in the eyes,

10:29.128 --> 10:30.629
broken hyoid bone
and cartilage.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.673
But the official report
says that injuries like that

10:32.757 --> 10:34.550
-are not unusual in hanging.
-MICAH: They got a reason

10:34.633 --> 10:36.218
-to protect their own asses.
-Key words there
are "official report."

10:36.302 --> 10:38.220
Look, why is it so hard
to believe that a professional,

10:38.304 --> 10:41.015
well-respected medical examiner
could be telling the truth?

10:41.098 --> 10:43.726
Look, Epstein ties his bedsheets
into a noose, right?

10:43.809 --> 10:45.353
Then he tied it around his neck.

10:45.436 --> 10:49.065
It's not gonna be
a clean, sharp cut like this.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.735
His weight is gonna
push the noose up like that.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.488
-Uh, actually, I feel like...
-(overlapping chatter)

10:55.571 --> 10:57.406
LIZ:
Guys.

10:58.657 --> 11:00.034
(sighs)

11:02.328 --> 11:04.997
(indistinct chatter)

11:11.170 --> 11:12.296
MARISSA:
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.798
Wait, wait. You guys.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.424
He could've... he could've
paid someone else

11:15.508 --> 11:16.759
-to break his neck.
-Or someone had him killed.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.761
-Oh, back to Trump again.
-Well, of course
it goes back to Trump.

11:18.844 --> 11:19.762
LEAH:
If the tiny glove fits...

11:19.845 --> 11:22.098
All right, l-let's...
let's stay on track.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.974
Liz, Liz, uh, we need to talk.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.268
Oh. All right. Just, uh,
give me... give me one minute.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.978
We start with the obvious.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.438
But suicide isn't the obvious.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.232
That's just
the official version.

11:31.315 --> 11:33.109
This is everything
that had to go wrong

11:33.192 --> 11:34.777
for Epstein to commit suicide.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.987
Start with the suicide attempt
a few weeks earlier.

11:37.071 --> 11:39.990
This was July 23, right after
he'd been denied bail.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.909
They found him unconscious
in his cell.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.537
(voice fading): There was video
of this suicide attempt...

11:51.502 --> 11:53.504
(voice muted)

11:55.381 --> 11:57.133
Isn't that the video
of his actual suicide?

11:57.216 --> 11:58.968
JAY:
No, this was a week earlier.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.136
It's a different missing video.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.596
They put him on suicide watch
for less than a week.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.473
(voice fading): Then Epstein was
taken off suicide watch

12:04.557 --> 12:06.475
and placed...

12:06.559 --> 12:08.102
(voice muted)

12:08.185 --> 12:09.520
KEVIN:
So, everyone gets a cellmate

12:09.603 --> 12:10.896
except for the suicidal man?

12:10.980 --> 12:12.022
LUCCA:
It's the worst jail in America.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.149
What do you expect?

12:13.232 --> 12:14.650
LEAH:
Reportedly understaffed

12:14.733 --> 12:17.653
as a result of a hiring freeze
imposed by who?

12:17.736 --> 12:19.321
-The Trump administration.
-MICAH: Why am I not surprised?

12:19.405 --> 12:21.323
-Why am I not surprised?
-ROSALYN: The second M.E. said

12:21.407 --> 12:22.658
that the noose found
in the autopsy report

12:22.741 --> 12:24.118
did not match the wounds
on his neck.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.453
That is consistent
with homicide.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.787
Who cares about
the autopsy report?

12:26.871 --> 12:29.373
(overlapping chatter)

12:37.256 --> 12:39.008
-Um, uh...
-Hey, guys.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.927
There is another way
to look at this.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.014
Now, everybody loves a puzzle.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.974
I get that.

12:47.057 --> 12:51.687
Everybody loves the secret word
that solves everything.

12:51.770 --> 12:54.190
But let's not call conspiracy

12:54.273 --> 12:56.275
something that could
just as easily be described

12:56.358 --> 12:57.985
as incompetence.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.988
Now, look, I have workers
come to my house every week.

13:01.071 --> 13:05.868
I mean, every damn week
to fix a broken faucet.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.537
They say they fixed it.
About a week goes by,

13:08.621 --> 13:11.415
I have to call somebody else
to fix their work.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.502
That's not a conspiracy.
That is incompetence.

13:14.585 --> 13:18.506
People do just enough work
to get by.

13:18.589 --> 13:21.091
So the camera was broken
outside of Epstein's cell.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.843
Incompetence.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.763
The guards were surfing the Web,
and then they fell asleep.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.389
Incompetence.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.017
The prison didn't secure
the crime scene.

13:30.100 --> 13:33.687
Incompetence.
I mean, that is America.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.731
Okay.

13:35.814 --> 13:40.069
All right, so we start
with suicide.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.445
I want to agree with Adrian.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.239
I'm not into
conspiracy theories,

13:43.322 --> 13:44.740
but, um...

13:44.823 --> 13:47.743
let's just look at 2006.

13:47.826 --> 13:52.706
Epstein got arrested
for abusing underage girls,

13:52.790 --> 13:54.208
and guess what happened.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.418
He was let off with

13:56.502 --> 13:59.588
a single count of prostitutio.

13:59.672 --> 14:03.801
The FBI found 34 victims
and could have found more,

14:03.884 --> 14:05.886
but they were shut down.

14:05.970 --> 14:09.056
We believe that
we proceeded appropriately.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.600
DIANE:
Epstein was supposed
to go to prison,

14:11.684 --> 14:14.061
but he got let out every day

14:14.144 --> 14:17.273
and raped more underage girls.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.401
And then, for eight years,
he was supposed to check in

14:20.484 --> 14:22.236
with the New York Police

14:22.319 --> 14:24.989
every 90 days because
he was a Level 3 sex offender.

14:25.072 --> 14:26.907
And you know how often
he checked in?

14:26.991 --> 14:29.243
Never.

14:29.326 --> 14:31.579
So, what are you saying?

14:31.662 --> 14:33.163
Well, we all
have to obey the law.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.457
I mean, if we're told that
we have to check in

14:35.541 --> 14:39.003
with the police every 90 days,
we do it.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.462
But certain people
don't have to.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.464
They're given special treatment.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.968
Epstein had friends
in high places,

14:46.051 --> 14:49.346
and then they stopped being
his friends, and they started

14:49.430 --> 14:51.015
worrying about him.

14:52.349 --> 14:53.851
And that's why he's dead.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.936
Well, I'm so glad
you don't believe in...

14:56.020 --> 14:57.271
conspiracy theories.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.314
That is America.

14:58.397 --> 15:01.817
That is not incompetence.

15:01.900 --> 15:06.030
It's a special fucking off-ramp
for the well-connected.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.781
Okay.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.700
All right, let's just...

15:09.783 --> 15:11.368
split into three groups:

15:11.452 --> 15:12.703
medical evidence,

15:12.786 --> 15:16.123
post-death facts,
pretrial facts.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.958
Facts.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.339
So... we were just upstairs

15:23.422 --> 15:25.966
for a synergy talk.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.010
Okay. What does that mean?

15:28.093 --> 15:30.137
We have to reduce
our payroll by 20%.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.222
-What? Wha...
-ADRIAN: Yep. 20.

15:32.306 --> 15:35.517
Payroll? What, as-as-as in
office space or...?

15:35.601 --> 15:37.645
No, no. Lawyers.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.688
So we've been putting
some initial thoughts together,

15:39.772 --> 15:41.565
seeing if there's anybody
we could agree on.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.068
Well, we can agree we're not
gonna lose 20% of our lawyers.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.653
We have a lot of paralegals.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.529
-What about Goldie?
-No. She's really bright

15:47.613 --> 15:49.198
and has excellent
research skills,

15:49.281 --> 15:52.034
and paralegals aren't gonna
get us there.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.411
-I for one could lose Kevin.
-Are you kidding?

15:54.495 --> 15:55.704
The-the associates
look up to him.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.206
We'd have a mutiny on our hands.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.457
-Uh, Lucy?
-No. No.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.709
-In fact, she deserves a raise.
-DIANE: This is gonna look like

16:00.793 --> 16:02.336
a disaster to our clients.

16:02.419 --> 16:03.754
Like the firm is going down

16:03.837 --> 16:05.547
and we're throwing
the ballast over.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.049
Yeah, I know.
(inhales deeply)

16:07.132 --> 16:09.760
So.... who do we let go?

16:13.931 --> 16:16.225
(indistinct chatter)

16:16.308 --> 16:17.601
JAY:
Have you heard from
any character witnesses yet?

16:17.685 --> 16:19.561
We talked to one
of his friends in prison.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.980
-Epstein had a friend in prison?
-Epstein told him
he took care of

16:22.064 --> 16:24.274
the most important thing on
the jet before he got arrested.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.193
-What was the most
important thing?
-No idea,

16:26.276 --> 16:28.570
but he was arrested getting off
of his private jet at Teterboro.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.030
That was the last time
he was free.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.740
So I was thinking
we should go through

16:31.824 --> 16:34.284
the police photos of the arrest,
see who else was on the jet.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.620
I guess he could have talked
to one of his staff members.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.249
(exhales sharply)

16:40.332 --> 16:42.251
What?

16:42.334 --> 16:43.460
I know him.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.921
Wha... Who is it?

16:46.004 --> 16:47.923
LUCCA:
Andreas.

16:48.006 --> 16:49.967
Hairdresser to the stars.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.928
How do you know
a hairdresser to the stars?

16:53.011 --> 16:54.930
Bianca?

16:58.976 --> 17:00.394
(elevator bell dings)

17:02.229 --> 17:05.065
STELLA:
So, Julius,
you're a federal employee.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.608
Is what you're
coming forward with

17:06.692 --> 17:08.444
based on a reasonable belief

17:08.527 --> 17:11.989
that there's been a violation
of the law, gross mismanagement

17:12.072 --> 17:13.615
or abuse of authority?

17:13.699 --> 17:16.118
So fraud, waste or abuse?

17:16.201 --> 17:17.578
Abuse of authority.

17:17.661 --> 17:18.954
STELLA:
I am all ears.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.748
What exactly
is he protected from?

17:20.831 --> 17:22.791
STELLA:
Anything that
constitutes retaliation.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.336
-5-USC-2302 makes it
a federal crime.
-And who enforces this?

17:26.420 --> 17:29.089
STELLA:
The Office of
the Inspector General.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.883
That would be me.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.760
JULIUS:
Okay.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.262
-STELLA: You ready?
-Yeah.

17:39.725 --> 17:43.771
JULIUS:
There is a document
titled Memo 618.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.404
What do you need?

17:53.405 --> 17:55.824
Hi. Is Andreas in?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.618
-What time is your appointment?
-Oh, uh,

17:57.701 --> 17:59.203
no, I don't...
I don't have an appointment.

17:59.286 --> 18:02.831
Ma'am, Andreas is booked
two months in advance.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.000
Uh, I can pencil
a consultation in

18:05.083 --> 18:07.461
for... September.

18:07.544 --> 18:10.172
Tell him it's Lucca Quinn
from Saint Lucia.

18:10.255 --> 18:13.383
Yeah, unfortunately,
Andreas is quite busy.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.885
Maybe another time.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.806
Tell him I'm... Bianca's friend.

18:24.436 --> 18:28.023
Yeah, there's a lady here
who said she's Bianca's friend.

18:28.106 --> 18:30.317
-Lucca Quinn.
-ANDREAS: Lucca!

18:30.400 --> 18:34.029
-Andreas, hi.
-(laughs) Hi.

18:34.112 --> 18:35.864
Uh, reschedule Mrs. Roth
for tomorrow.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.033
-Oh, she just had her hair wash.
-Well, then, blow-dry it

18:38.116 --> 18:39.785
-and tell her I'm busy.
-Oh, no, I don't need a cut.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.537
-I just have a-a question.
-Come back, come back.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.996
Sorry.
I-I didn't know who you were.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.541
She's new. I'm firing her.

18:45.624 --> 18:48.168
-Oh, no, not for me.
-No, not because of you.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.045
'Cause she's useless.
Get out of the chair.

18:50.128 --> 18:51.713
Go ahead. Go. Go.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.131
Thank you.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.050
-Sit.
-(Lucca clears throat)

18:55.134 --> 18:56.677
How long? Three weeks?

18:56.760 --> 18:58.679
Uh, yeah, but I'm thinking
of growing it out.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.472
I see some damage here.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.765
(sniffs)

19:01.849 --> 19:03.392
Adona shampoo?

19:03.475 --> 19:05.602
-Janguree conditioner?
-Yes.

19:05.686 --> 19:08.814
You might as well pour concrete
on your hair.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.568
These. Use these.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.027
Thank you.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.029
Uh, but I'm here
about one of your clients.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.906
Oh, Bianca hasn't been in
in a week.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.742
Oh, no. Um, Jeffrey Epstein?

19:22.786 --> 19:24.413
Get out of here.

19:28.166 --> 19:31.587
He is unequivocally
not an official client.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.922
I only cut his hair
as a favor to Ghislaine.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.966
I don't want to get caught up
in any of his mess.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.718
Yeah, but you were
on a flight with him

19:37.801 --> 19:40.679
-right before his arrest.
-It was a midflight haircut.

19:40.762 --> 19:43.265
He knew he was being arrested.
He wanted to look good.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.518
Plus, prison haircuts
are just brutal.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.314
Who else was on the flight?

19:50.397 --> 19:51.940
(whispering): I shouldn't be
talking about this.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.567
-It's not safe.
-Okay.

19:53.650 --> 19:56.945
On the plane, did Epstein
seem nervous? Worried?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.697
No, no, I was the one
that was nervous.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.532
-Why?
-Because...

20:03.035 --> 20:04.286
-Nothing.
-Andreas, what?

20:04.369 --> 20:05.537
Nothing.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.623
You are lying,
and you're terrible at it.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.750
Just lean in toward me
and whisper.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.335
(whispers):
I can't.

20:11.418 --> 20:13.795
I'll tell you a secret
if you tell me yours.

20:16.214 --> 20:17.966
What secret?

20:18.050 --> 20:19.426
No, you first.

20:26.224 --> 20:28.810
(whispers):
He gave me an envelope.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.396
Epstein did? Why?

20:31.480 --> 20:34.149
No, y-your turn.

20:34.232 --> 20:37.152
I played poker with four
of the most powerful women

20:37.235 --> 20:38.862
-in the world.
-Fuck you. You did not.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.490
Bianca and who else?

20:41.573 --> 20:43.450
Why would he give you
an envelope?

20:43.533 --> 20:44.701
-Beyoncé?
-No.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.161
It better not be
some political woman,

20:46.244 --> 20:48.163
-someone I don't know.
-You'll know all of them.

20:48.246 --> 20:50.165
Andreas, tell me.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.625
He...

20:51.708 --> 20:53.835
He knew Ghislaine
was a friend of mine

20:53.919 --> 20:56.838
and that she'd be in
in a couple of weeks

20:56.922 --> 20:59.383
to pick it up-- the envelope.
But she never showed.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.051
I think she's in hiding.

21:01.134 --> 21:02.761
(whispers):
Or dead.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.057
So, you still have it?

21:09.142 --> 21:10.811
Can I see it?

21:23.740 --> 21:24.908
You never opened it?

21:24.992 --> 21:27.035
No.

21:28.161 --> 21:30.163
Maybe I should hold on to it.

21:40.674 --> 21:44.094

chain of custody for an envelope

21:44.177 --> 21:46.179
reportedly given
by Jeffrey Epstein

21:46.263 --> 21:50.517
to his employee and girlfriend,
Ghislaine Maxwell.

21:50.600 --> 21:54.021
It is Thursday, May 21, 2020,

21:54.104 --> 21:57.232
and we have been given
permission by Wilbur Dincon,

21:57.315 --> 21:59.860
U.S. attorney for the
Southern District of New York,

21:59.943 --> 22:03.405
to open this envelope and record
its contents in accordance

22:03.488 --> 22:05.574
with our mission
as investigators

22:05.657 --> 22:07.743
of Mr. Epstein's death.
Go ahead.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.416
All right,
the envelope is now open.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.293
And, uh...

22:17.669 --> 22:20.297
There appears to be
a key inside.

22:23.341 --> 22:25.761
No apparent markings.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.262
And, uh...

22:27.346 --> 22:30.766
there's a ten-digit number
on the other side.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.142
(paper rustling)

22:32.225 --> 22:34.061
Okay.

22:35.103 --> 22:36.146
All right.

22:36.229 --> 22:37.773
There appears to be

22:37.856 --> 22:42.069
an eight-and-a-half-by-11
letter folded in thirds.

22:42.152 --> 22:44.738
Nothing on the outside
of the letter.

22:44.821 --> 22:47.282
We will now open the letter.

22:47.365 --> 22:49.117
And....

22:49.201 --> 22:51.536
there is handwriting
on the inside,

22:51.620 --> 22:53.121
which reads...

22:53.205 --> 22:54.956
"If I'm dead,

22:55.040 --> 22:56.750
watch out for Bud."

22:56.833 --> 22:59.252
Whoa, who's Bud?

22:59.336 --> 23:02.047
-The killer?
-LIZ: We are now

23:02.130 --> 23:03.799
comparing the handwriting

23:03.882 --> 23:08.136
to the last note
Mr. Epstein wrote in his cell,

23:08.220 --> 23:12.349
and they appear to be written
by the same hand.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.187

23:26.655 --> 23:28.115
"Lady M.S."

23:28.198 --> 23:29.282
Or a-a bank account?

23:29.366 --> 23:30.784
LIZ:
Maybe.

23:30.867 --> 23:34.204
And who is Lady M.S.?

23:34.287 --> 23:36.123
A pet name for Ghislaine, maybe?

23:38.416 --> 23:40.335
-(indistinct chatter)
-LIZ: We have a new lead.

23:40.418 --> 23:42.337
"Bud."

23:42.420 --> 23:45.173
Is it someone
who had it out for Epstein?

23:45.257 --> 23:46.466
Why would he fear him?

23:46.550 --> 23:48.677
Uh, let's see,
I'll take, uh, Mike,

23:48.760 --> 23:51.471
John, Damian and Linda
to pursue that lead.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.473
All right, who wants
to check these numbers?

23:53.557 --> 23:57.144
This could be a bank account.
Cayman Islands? Uh, a safe?

23:57.227 --> 23:58.687
We can take that.
Epstein was always trying

23:58.770 --> 24:00.021
to hide money from his victims.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.482
Plus, those underage girls
are still trying

24:02.566 --> 24:04.901
to recover damages,
so a hidden account means

24:04.985 --> 24:07.863
-more to recover.
-Good, and last, the key.

24:07.946 --> 24:10.740

-Uh, Marissa and I have the key.

hired Epstein

30:43.299 --> 30:45.093
-to work with children?
-Yes.

30:45.176 --> 30:47.053
I think Epstein
was telling Ghislaine

30:47.136 --> 30:48.763
to find something in this book.

30:48.846 --> 30:51.683
It's how they probably
communicated secretly.

30:52.809 --> 30:54.894
So, what do these numbers mean?

30:56.688 --> 30:58.606
BENJAMIN:
Yes, I'm Benjamin

30:58.690 --> 31:00.316
Ulrich Dafoe, but trust me,

31:00.400 --> 31:02.235
no one has ever called me "Bud."

31:02.318 --> 31:04.612
And no one has ever needed
to "watch out" for me.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.281
Especially not that asshole.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.283
When did you decide your
former client was an asshole?

31:08.366 --> 31:10.952
Probably about the time
he ditched me for Dershowitz.

31:11.035 --> 31:13.621
At least I didn't get a massage,
like that shyster.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.623
And for the purposes
of any potential lawsuit,

31:15.707 --> 31:17.959
"shyster" is just my opinion,
not a statement of fact.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.294
Then Epstein had
some two-bit lawyer

31:19.377 --> 31:21.004
in the Virgin Islands
redo his will.

31:21.087 --> 31:22.171
Why did he do that?

31:22.255 --> 31:23.631
Mm, if Epstein's estate

31:23.715 --> 31:25.300
was set up
in the Virgin Islands,

31:25.383 --> 31:26.843
his victims would have
a hard time

31:26.926 --> 31:28.303
getting at his money.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.263
Alleged victims.

31:30.346 --> 31:32.140
He was a vindictive
motherfucker.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.267
It makes sense he wouldn't want
those girls getting his money.

31:34.350 --> 31:36.936
And he put a lot of thought into
what would happen after he died.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.981
Did he ever mention
somebody he was afraid of?

31:40.064 --> 31:41.649
(scoffs)
He was afraid of everyone.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.027
-He had something on everyone.
-Anyone named Bud?

31:44.110 --> 31:47.447
No, but I heard him
mention Bud a few times.

31:48.281 --> 31:49.991
In what context?

31:51.534 --> 31:53.995
Look, I'll tell you
if you promise

31:54.078 --> 31:55.288
you'll take down Dershowitz.

31:55.371 --> 31:57.290
Why? Is he Bud?

31:57.373 --> 31:58.750
No, but I still hate his guts.

31:58.833 --> 32:00.001
The guy would sell
his grandmother

32:00.084 --> 32:01.711
to suck up
to the rich and famous.

32:01.794 --> 32:03.546
And for the purposes
of any potential lawsuit,

32:03.630 --> 32:05.465
that's just my opinion,
not a statement of fact.

32:05.548 --> 32:06.799
Mr. Dafoe, Bud.

32:06.883 --> 32:08.051
Right. Epstein.

32:08.134 --> 32:09.969
He was obsessed with the future.

32:10.053 --> 32:11.638
Uh, he kept trying
to get a professor

32:11.721 --> 32:13.306
at the U of C on the payroll.

32:13.389 --> 32:14.724
Um, Ira Nofzinger.

32:14.807 --> 32:16.684
Epstein loved that guy--
he kept talking to him

32:16.768 --> 32:18.603
-on the phone about Bud.
-In what way?

32:19.937 --> 32:21.856
No idea.
I mean, Epstein had that ranch

32:21.939 --> 32:23.524
in New Mexico, 10,000 acres.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.860
He was gonna impregnate
a hundred young girls,

32:25.943 --> 32:27.695
try to keep
his dynasty alive, whatever.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.364
It's not my business.
Talk to Nofzinger.

32:29.447 --> 32:30.990
And remember,
watch out for Dershowitz.

32:31.074 --> 32:33.660
That asshole will sue you
at the drop of a hat.

32:33.743 --> 32:35.328
And for the purposes of any
potential lawsuit, "asshole,"

32:35.411 --> 32:36.663
-that's just my opinion,
not a statement...
-Okay.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.541
All right, these numbers
are in groups of three.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.211
-Mm-hmm.
-And notice how
the first numbers are larger--

32:43.294 --> 32:45.880
uh, 204, 161, 165--

32:45.963 --> 32:47.882
and the last
of the three numbers are lower,

32:47.965 --> 32:49.008
lower than 12?

32:49.092 --> 32:50.885
-Yeah. Meaning?
-My guess is,

32:50.968 --> 32:53.513
the first number's
a page number,

32:53.596 --> 32:55.598
second number is
how many lines down,

32:55.682 --> 33:00.520
and the last number is how many
words across on that line.

33:00.603 --> 33:02.855
Let's try it.

33:02.939 --> 33:05.358
First number: 81.

33:05.441 --> 33:07.402
LUCCA:
Eighty... one.

33:07.485 --> 33:10.071
-Next number: 31.
-31.

33:10.154 --> 33:12.740
-11.
-11.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.409
"Call."

33:18.037 --> 33:20.581
(car doors open)

33:21.833 --> 33:23.918
Julius Cain.

33:24.001 --> 33:25.962
Officers?
Is everything all right?

33:26.045 --> 33:28.297
-You're under arrest.
-(scoffs) For what?

33:28.381 --> 33:30.883
Please turn around, sir.
Show me your hands.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.260
-(Julius stammering)
-When I search you,

33:32.343 --> 33:33.761
is there anything
that will stick me?

33:33.845 --> 33:35.430
There must be some confusion.
I'm a judge.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.098
-Turn around, sir, now.
-Wait, wait, wait.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.641
I need to make a phone call.

33:38.725 --> 33:39.934
You need to follow
instructions, sir.

33:40.017 --> 33:41.811
-I... Hey! I need...
-Turn around.

33:41.894 --> 33:43.938
-Get your hands up now.
-Hey! Wait! Stop...

33:47.900 --> 33:49.944
-(grunts)
-(handcuffs clicking)

33:50.027 --> 33:52.029
You have the right
to remain silent.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.115
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

33:54.198 --> 33:55.324
in a court of law.

34:01.038 --> 34:04.125
-Uh, 25.
-25.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.669
Okay, and that's
the last one. Six.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.629
-"Hours."
-"Hours."

34:08.713 --> 34:10.757
(clears throat)

34:10.840 --> 34:12.258
What do you got?

34:12.341 --> 34:13.593
JAY:
"Call Bill.

34:13.676 --> 34:15.094
"He will have...

34:15.178 --> 34:17.221
12 hours."

34:22.185 --> 34:24.312
What do you think?

34:24.395 --> 34:26.439
Bill? Bill Barr.

34:26.522 --> 34:28.483
I mean, it's his
father's novel, right?

34:28.566 --> 34:31.319
Do you ever feel like
this is getting out of hand?

34:31.402 --> 34:34.322
Like the more we dig,
the more there is to dig?

34:34.405 --> 34:36.824
I don't know,
but what can we do

34:36.908 --> 34:38.618
but keep digging?

34:38.701 --> 34:40.828
(sighs)

34:40.912 --> 34:43.581
IRA:
I deeply regret ever
associating with him.

34:43.664 --> 34:46.000
But, hey, Stephen Hawking
was his friend.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.169
He even went down to Epstein's
island in the Caribbean.

34:48.252 --> 34:50.338
So, if Hawking could do it,
why couldn't I?

34:50.421 --> 34:52.173
Well, we heard he enjoyed
spending time with you.

34:52.256 --> 34:53.883
I think he liked being
on our campus.

34:53.966 --> 34:56.052
He used to show up
in a Harvard sweatshirt.

34:56.135 --> 34:57.887
He never went there.
I checked.

34:57.970 --> 35:00.306
He had the scientific mind
of a teenage boy.

35:00.389 --> 35:02.642
He was into alien abductions,
cryonics.

35:04.227 --> 35:07.271
I told him, you can't reanimate
frozen tissue, not yet.

35:07.355 --> 35:08.898
We're still experimenting.

35:08.981 --> 35:10.983
But he was intent
on living forever,

35:11.067 --> 35:13.486
-coming back like Disney.
-And the ranch in New Mexico?

35:13.569 --> 35:15.863
His absolute favorite topic
was eugenics.

35:15.947 --> 35:19.992
He wanted to impregnate
20 exceptional, high-IQ women.

35:20.076 --> 35:23.704
We heard Epstein kept talking
to you about "Bud."

35:25.665 --> 35:27.208
No.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.585
I remember him saying,
"I got to look after Bud,"

35:29.669 --> 35:31.921
but I didn't know
who he was talking about.

35:32.004 --> 35:35.049
Wait, wait.
Uh, did he say "look after Bud"

35:35.132 --> 35:37.343
or "look out for Bud"?

35:37.426 --> 35:39.220
I don't...
What's the difference?

35:39.303 --> 35:41.430
Was Bud someone
that he was afraid of,

35:41.514 --> 35:44.100
or was it someone
he was protecting?

35:45.143 --> 35:46.644
I don't know.

35:49.355 --> 35:51.899
Okay, so what if we were wrong
about Bud?

35:51.983 --> 35:53.943
What if Epstein meant
"defend Bud,"

35:54.026 --> 35:56.404
-not "beware of him"?
-And-and if that's true,

35:56.487 --> 36:00.449
then does that change anything
for our teams? Anyone?

36:00.533 --> 36:02.618
-Lucca?
-No, not for us, but we do think

36:02.702 --> 36:04.745
we deciphered the numbers
in the envelope.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.080
Really? What?

36:06.163 --> 36:07.915
Jay?

36:07.999 --> 36:11.294
Uh, we think "Lady M.S." refers
to Lady Morgan Sidney

36:11.377 --> 36:13.379
in a sci-fi novel
about sex slaves

36:13.462 --> 36:15.214
called Space Relations.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.925
-What?
-It's a book written by

36:18.009 --> 36:20.761
Donald Barr, the father
of Attorney General Bill Barr.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.722
-What the fuck?
-We think the numbers were a way

36:22.805 --> 36:24.390
for Epstein and Ghislaine
to communicate.

36:24.473 --> 36:25.933
It's a simple book cipher.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.102
It translates as...

36:28.185 --> 36:30.730
"Call Bill.
He will have 12 hours."

36:30.813 --> 36:32.273
Bill who?

36:32.356 --> 36:34.775
Bill Barr-- which means
this could be about Trump.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.777
-Oh, God, back to Trump again.
-(others murmuring)

36:36.861 --> 36:38.905
Well, who else?
Think about Dershowitz.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.574
-He defended Epstein and Trump.
-What about the other Bill?

36:41.657 --> 36:43.743
Bill Clinton. They both
had something to worry about

36:43.826 --> 36:45.953
-from Epstein.
-Oh, God, the biggest
conspiracy theory in history.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.455
-What about Prince Andrew?
-Yeah, let's just dig up

36:47.538 --> 36:49.498
-Vince Foster and ask him.
-Can we start narrowing

36:49.582 --> 36:52.126
our focus?
I mean, this is sounding

36:52.210 --> 36:53.669
-a bit Pizzagate-ish.
-ROSALYN: Epstein was part

36:53.753 --> 36:55.796
of a global pedophile ring
that was supported

36:55.880 --> 36:58.466
by intelligence services,
and that is Pizzagate.

36:58.549 --> 37:00.468
-But a real one.
-Where are you getting
intelligence services?

37:00.551 --> 37:02.929
Those are Alex Acosta's words.
He was the federal prosecutor

37:03.012 --> 37:04.680
who gave Epstein
such a light plea deal

37:04.764 --> 37:06.641
-back in Florida.
-LEAH: And the man

37:06.724 --> 37:08.142
that Trump made
his Labor Secretary.

37:08.225 --> 37:09.727
-Oh, my God. Trump.
-Okay, okay, can we just

37:09.810 --> 37:11.812
keep it to one conspiracy theory
at a time, please.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.482
Acosta told people that Epstein
belonged to intelligence.

37:14.565 --> 37:15.983
That's why the underage girls...

37:16.067 --> 37:18.611
Donald Barr was OSS,
and Bill Barr was CIA.

37:18.694 --> 37:20.363
-That's it.
-LIZ: Okay. Oh, um, Marissa,

37:20.446 --> 37:22.198
-do you have anything
on the key?
-I do.

37:22.281 --> 37:25.034
It led to Epstein's architect,
who had this.

37:25.117 --> 37:26.994
What is this?
His Manhattan home?

37:27.078 --> 37:29.580
No, it looks like his temple
on his island in the Caribbean.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.707
-He has a temple?
-Yeah. Here.
-What is it for?

37:31.791 --> 37:34.293
MARISSA:
No one knows.
Maybe sex, maybe music.

37:34.377 --> 37:36.462
-Okay, so this-this...
this is a dead end?
-Not necessarily.

37:36.545 --> 37:39.173
-I'll look into it.
-No. No. We-we need to have
some dead ends.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.676
-I mean, this is...
this is getting nuts.
-Oh, and there was

37:41.759 --> 37:43.469
one other thing:
the architect said

37:43.552 --> 37:46.013
Epstein told her everything
went south for him in 1992.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.640
-What happened then?
-No idea. She didn't say.

37:47.723 --> 37:49.058
DIANE:
Wait.

37:50.142 --> 37:51.852
-Did she say what month?
-Yeah.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.145
November. Why?

37:54.397 --> 37:55.690
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

37:55.773 --> 37:57.566
It's just a thought to pursue.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.694
Eli Gold had a friend
who was a cheerleader.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.529
-Okay.
-I have to ask Marissa

38:01.612 --> 38:03.155
if she remembers her.

38:03.239 --> 38:04.740
ADRIAN:
You guys...

38:04.824 --> 38:06.492
we need to talk.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.079
Chase is willing
to lend us ten million.

38:10.162 --> 38:12.081
-Really?
-(chuckles): Yeah.

38:12.164 --> 38:14.500
-Is there a "but"?
-A small one.

38:14.583 --> 38:16.877
The firm's assets
are not enough collateral.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.005
And you look happy because...?

38:19.088 --> 38:23.050
We can still secure the loan
if we use our houses.

38:23.134 --> 38:26.721
-Uh, what?
-Look, they were just estimating
our property values,

38:26.804 --> 38:29.849
-but they believe
that will put us over the line.
-LIZ: This is insane. This is...

38:29.932 --> 38:31.892
-They believe that can get us
over the line.
-No, I am a single mother.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.894
-I am not risking my house.
-Hold on.

38:33.978 --> 38:36.856
Liz, we get the firm back,
we pay the money back.

38:36.939 --> 38:38.733
-How do you know?
-Because I know how much

38:38.816 --> 38:40.526
-we used to take in, Diane.
-"Past performance

38:40.609 --> 38:42.528
does not predict
future results."

38:42.611 --> 38:44.071
Especially with us.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.573
I mean, we lost...
we lost Chumhum,

38:45.656 --> 38:47.533
we had the fallout from my dad.

38:47.616 --> 38:49.702
And let us not forget
why we joined STR Laurie

38:49.785 --> 38:52.705
-in the first place.
-Liz, it's our only move.

38:52.788 --> 38:55.416
Now, we are building revenue
every day.

38:55.499 --> 38:57.877
Now, you say
you've got Dincon engaged.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.754
If we don't get out
from under STR Laurie,

38:59.837 --> 39:01.714
ain't no telling what's next.

39:01.797 --> 39:04.091
They don't value our work,
our-our employees,

39:04.175 --> 39:06.719
our-our history or our culture.

39:06.802 --> 39:09.597
(laughs)

39:09.680 --> 39:14.143
They want us for our black faces
on their diversity reports.

39:18.606 --> 39:22.109
MAN:
This recently unearthed
footage from November 1992

39:22.193 --> 39:24.445
shows future president
Donald Trump

39:24.528 --> 39:28.491
entertaining Jeffrey Epstein
at his Mar-a-Lago estate.

39:28.574 --> 39:30.493
The two men seem
quite friendly,

39:30.576 --> 39:32.620
dancing, enjoying themselves,

39:32.703 --> 39:36.665
and at one point, apparently
sharing a private joke.

39:36.749 --> 39:38.292
All around them
are cheerleaders

39:38.375 --> 39:41.295
from the Buffalo Bills
and the Miami Dolphins.

39:41.378 --> 39:44.298
Trump now seeks to downplay
his connection to Epstein,

39:44.381 --> 39:46.300
but this footage proves
that they shared

39:46.384 --> 39:49.470
some fun-loving
bachelor moments.

39:49.553 --> 39:54.100
So... so you were there
when Jeffrey Epstein met Trump,

39:54.183 --> 39:55.643
-Mrs. Feldman?
-Oh, yeah.

39:55.726 --> 39:57.269
I was one of the cheerleaders.

39:57.353 --> 39:58.687
Oh, that was a kick.

39:58.771 --> 40:01.273
I mean, Donald
kept getting fresh, but...

40:01.357 --> 40:03.359
Never grabbed my pussy, so...

40:03.442 --> 40:07.113
(laughing)

40:09.073 --> 40:11.325
Ah, I voted for him. Why not?

40:11.408 --> 40:12.827
DIANE:
Did you happen to hear

40:12.910 --> 40:14.203
what they said to each other?

40:14.286 --> 40:15.996
-Who?
-Trump and Epstein.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.164
Oh. Oh, yeah.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.833
Oh, yeah, I was right there.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.168
Uh, I was supposed
to hang on their arms

40:21.252 --> 40:23.003
and make them feel wanted,

40:23.087 --> 40:25.965
and they just kept saying,
"Do you think she's hot?"

40:26.048 --> 40:27.842
"I think she's hot."
"I think she's hot." (mutters)

40:27.925 --> 40:28.968
That's it?

40:29.051 --> 40:30.344
Yeah, well,
nothing presidential,

40:30.427 --> 40:32.138
if that's what you're wondering.

40:32.221 --> 40:34.890
Um, anything about "Bud"?

40:36.725 --> 40:38.644
How do you know about that?

40:38.727 --> 40:40.563
What?

40:40.646 --> 40:42.690
Bud.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.984
Well, that was
the weirdest thing.

40:45.067 --> 40:46.777
That... that
really stayed with me.

40:46.861 --> 40:47.903
What?

40:49.822 --> 40:52.199
Well, Trump leaned into Jeffee--

40:52.283 --> 40:54.118
oh, I had to call him "Jeffee"--

40:54.201 --> 40:56.370
and, uh, he whispered,

40:56.453 --> 40:58.372
"How's Bud?"
And then Jeffee whispered back,

40:58.455 --> 40:59.790
"No problems."

40:59.874 --> 41:01.375
And that was it.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.379
And why was that weird?

41:05.462 --> 41:07.715
Well, because they both got
really serious.

41:07.798 --> 41:10.926
Like they...
like they had to be careful.

41:11.010 --> 41:13.053
Like they were worried.

41:18.767 --> 41:20.686
WOMAN:
Did he have a dog? Maybe they
were talking about his dog.

41:20.769 --> 41:23.022
All we know is that
Trump somehow knew Bud,

41:23.105 --> 41:24.899
or maybe still does, but we
still don't know who Bud is.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.984
I just heard back on 4chan.

41:27.067 --> 41:29.403
-MARISSA: What?
What did they say?
-Why are we on 4chan?

41:29.486 --> 41:31.071
Epstein's death
was first reported,

41:31.155 --> 41:32.698
even before
the mainstream media,

41:32.781 --> 41:34.074
by a poster on 4chan,

41:34.158 --> 41:36.493
someone with insider knowledge.

41:36.577 --> 41:38.579
-Is that true?
-Yuh-huh.
And I just wrote to him,

41:38.662 --> 41:41.916
asking if Bill Barr is involved,
and why was 12 hours a deadline?

41:41.999 --> 41:43.918
Okay, okay.
What are we talking about here?

41:44.001 --> 41:45.920
We-we think we may have
deciphered a message.

41:46.003 --> 41:48.088
-I'll-I'll tell you later.
-"Barr picked up Epstein's body

41:48.172 --> 41:49.423
"within 12 hours.

41:49.506 --> 41:51.800
It was taken
to the Virgin Islands."

41:51.884 --> 41:53.260
-The fuck?
-That's why the code read:

41:53.344 --> 41:54.970
"Call Bill.
He'll have 12 hours."

41:55.054 --> 41:57.431
Wait a second, wait a second.
What-what-what's going on?

41:57.514 --> 41:59.642
NBC News reported
that a mysterious associate

41:59.725 --> 42:02.269
picked up Epstein's body
from the medical examiner.

42:02.353 --> 42:03.437
He wouldn't give his name,

42:03.520 --> 42:05.439
and he's never been identified.

42:05.522 --> 42:08.275
And you think the attorney
general of the United States

42:08.359 --> 42:10.444
is that person?

42:10.527 --> 42:12.279
-It makes as much sense
as anything else.
-(computer chimes)

42:12.363 --> 42:14.114
-No, it doesn't.
-Wait, I just wrote
to him, asking,

42:14.198 --> 42:16.408
"I thought Epstein
was buried in Florida,"

42:16.492 --> 42:18.661
and he just wrote back...

42:21.830 --> 42:25.459
"Check the tomb. It's empty."

42:25.542 --> 42:27.920
Oh, come...
What is going on here?

42:28.003 --> 42:30.631
This... N-No. This is crazy.

42:30.714 --> 42:33.676
All these theories are built
on a hairdresser's envelope.

42:33.759 --> 42:36.637
If it's a prank,
then all of this is bullshit.

42:36.720 --> 42:40.474
-The government charges
Julius Cain...
-Judge Cain.

42:40.557 --> 42:44.561
...Julius Cain with violating
Chapter 18, USC 201,

42:44.645 --> 42:47.690
a Chapter 4 felony, punishable
by up to 15 years imprisonment.

42:47.773 --> 42:49.942
We allege he accepted bribes
from a plaintiff

42:50.025 --> 42:52.486
-in an eminent domain case.
-DIANE: Your Honor,

42:52.569 --> 42:54.280
Judge Cain pleads not guilty

42:54.363 --> 42:57.324
and should be released on bail
to await trial.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.285
He has extensive ties
to the community

42:59.368 --> 43:01.495
and is not a flight risk.

43:01.578 --> 43:03.747
(gavel slams)

43:05.207 --> 43:06.875
This is retribution?

43:06.959 --> 43:10.337
-For whistleblowing?
-That's my guess.

43:10.421 --> 43:13.173
We left the inspector general,
and the next day I get arrested.

43:13.257 --> 43:16.302
How could they know?
How could... How do they know?

43:17.553 --> 43:20.681
So maybe it's her clerk.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.599
Or...

43:23.600 --> 43:24.977
Or...?

43:27.605 --> 43:30.566
The inspector general.

43:30.649 --> 43:32.026
(scoffs)

43:32.109 --> 43:35.321
If that's so, what do I do?

43:36.780 --> 43:38.449
Fight.

43:45.039 --> 43:46.540
That was fast.

43:46.623 --> 43:48.625
So, who are you cutting?

43:50.085 --> 43:51.879
Everyone made
a good-faith effort

43:51.962 --> 43:55.549
to reduce the staff, Gavin,
but in the end, the...

43:55.632 --> 43:57.885
the arrangement
didn't work for us.

43:57.968 --> 43:59.511
No hard feelings.

43:59.595 --> 44:02.348
I don't understand.

44:02.431 --> 44:05.893
Uh, we are prepared to buy
our way out of the partnership,

44:05.976 --> 44:08.270
as enumerated in the contract.

44:08.354 --> 44:11.732
Ah, yes, well,
that is certainly your right.

44:11.815 --> 44:13.567
-Within the first year.
-ADRIAN: Good.

44:13.650 --> 44:17.321
And we're ready. We have
the 20 million required.

44:18.322 --> 44:19.782
You mean 80 million.

44:20.991 --> 44:22.910
No, 20 million.

44:22.993 --> 44:26.288
We all signed a merger agreement
that stresses "20 million."

44:26.372 --> 44:28.040
Uh, no.

44:28.123 --> 44:32.211
The contract says 20, provided,
according to clause 46-B,

44:32.294 --> 44:34.213
that all Reddick/Boseman
name partners

44:34.296 --> 44:36.090
earn more in revenue
after the merger

44:36.173 --> 44:38.258
than they did the year prior.

44:38.342 --> 44:39.760
Which we did.

44:39.843 --> 44:42.721
-No, you didn't.
-Oh, my God.

44:42.805 --> 44:44.306
What?

44:45.808 --> 44:48.560
That's why you gave it to me.

44:48.644 --> 44:51.772
It wasn't a gift.
It was a curse.

44:51.855 --> 44:54.108
Fuck.

44:54.191 --> 44:56.068
-Pro bono.
-DIANE: He gave me
pro bono cases

44:56.151 --> 44:58.654
to keep my billable hours low.

44:58.737 --> 45:01.281
Well, I-I also knew
that you'd be good at it, too.

45:01.365 --> 45:02.783
You fucker.

45:02.866 --> 45:03.951
(scoffs)
Diane. Name-calling?

45:04.034 --> 45:05.786
We're all on the same side here.

45:05.869 --> 45:08.622
You set me up,
just to keep us from leaving.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.960
I'm a jealous boss.

45:13.043 --> 45:14.795
I don't want you to leave.

45:14.878 --> 45:18.298
I want to cling close to you,
like a vine.

45:18.382 --> 45:20.259
Also, I kind of like
the look on your face

45:20.342 --> 45:21.510
that you were outplayed.

45:23.053 --> 45:24.972
The Zen master said

45:25.055 --> 45:27.307
that "in every experience
there is a lesson."

45:27.391 --> 45:32.104
And the lesson here
is that you three are fucked.

45:41.530 --> 45:44.283
Can... can you call the bank?

45:44.366 --> 45:46.368
Yes.

45:48.745 --> 45:50.205
Liz.

45:54.334 --> 45:56.670
Shit.

45:56.753 --> 45:58.881
As you can see, the amount
of suspicious activity

45:58.964 --> 46:01.467
surrounding Epstein's death
is... it's extraordinary.

46:01.550 --> 46:04.178
The number of things
that went wrong in the prison...

46:04.261 --> 46:06.430
The number of people
that wanted him dead?

46:06.513 --> 46:08.140
And the note he left
Ghislaine Maxwell,

46:08.223 --> 46:09.641
uh, "Watch out for Bud."

46:09.725 --> 46:11.852
Mm, the note he left
with the hairdresser?

46:11.935 --> 46:14.188
Uh, a celebrity hairstylist.

46:14.271 --> 46:15.689
ROSALYN:
He was also a part

46:15.772 --> 46:17.524
of a global pedophile ring
that was supported

46:17.608 --> 46:19.193
by intelligence services.

46:19.276 --> 46:21.403
Well...

46:21.487 --> 46:23.530
this is very extensive work.

46:23.614 --> 46:24.865
We're nowhere near done.

46:24.948 --> 46:26.825
We'll need at least
a few more weeks.

46:26.909 --> 46:28.494
LIZ:
We have a team down
in the Virgin Islands

46:28.577 --> 46:30.579
checking out Epstein's island.

46:36.502 --> 46:39.087
And we have a key
that we need to check.

46:39.171 --> 46:41.089
And what is this?

46:41.173 --> 46:43.717
Oh, uh, this is a-a code

46:43.800 --> 46:46.887
that reads: "Call Bill.
He will have 12 hours."

46:46.970 --> 46:49.556
Hmm. And what is that from?

46:49.640 --> 46:52.267
LUCCA:
It's from a book
Epstein referenced.

46:52.351 --> 46:54.102
It's a novel written
by Bill Barr's father.

46:54.186 --> 46:58.065
It's about space
and-and-and some sex slaves.

46:59.107 --> 47:00.192
And people...

47:00.275 --> 47:01.860
All right, so...

47:01.944 --> 47:03.612
where are we left?

47:03.695 --> 47:05.447
Uh, well, you-you said
you wanted us

47:05.531 --> 47:07.699
-to think outside the box.
-And...?

47:07.783 --> 47:11.203
And, um, well, uh,
Epstein had odd interests,

47:11.286 --> 47:14.581
and he seemed
to want to live forever.

47:14.665 --> 47:18.377
Uh, uh, we're not sure if Bud
is someone he feared

47:18.460 --> 47:20.754
or-or-or something he lost.

47:20.837 --> 47:23.924
Bud seems to be just one piece

47:24.007 --> 47:26.093
of the puzzle
we can't figure out.

47:26.176 --> 47:28.554
Okay.

47:28.637 --> 47:30.806
Why don't we take a pause?

47:32.015 --> 47:33.767
-A pause?
-Yeah.

47:33.850 --> 47:37.479
I think we've gotten
a little lost in the weeds here.

47:37.563 --> 47:42.442
You've done some great work,
but once we get into...

47:42.526 --> 47:45.112
this kind of conjecture,
I can't use it.

47:45.195 --> 47:46.613
I'm sorry.

47:46.697 --> 47:49.825
We will send someone
to pick up your notes

47:49.908 --> 47:53.245
and work product,
along with the materials

47:53.328 --> 47:56.790
left for Ms. Maxwell,
including the key.

47:56.873 --> 47:59.126
We'll have to get that to you.

47:59.209 --> 48:01.587
Fine.

48:01.670 --> 48:03.422
DIANE:
Mr. Dincon?

48:03.505 --> 48:05.340
Hmm?

48:05.424 --> 48:08.176
What is Memo 618?

48:09.219 --> 48:10.637
Why do you ask?

48:10.721 --> 48:13.390
Jeffrey Epstein's life
was built on it.

48:14.391 --> 48:16.518
Then you have your answer.

48:19.605 --> 48:21.648
(seabirds chirping)

48:28.572 --> 48:31.158
LIZ:
You should come home.
The investigation's over.

48:31.241 --> 48:33.243
DOJ is shutting us down.

48:33.327 --> 48:34.828
MARISSA:
But why would they do that?

48:34.911 --> 48:37.122
-We're so close.
-Yeah, well, in hindsight,

48:37.205 --> 48:40.000
I-I think we shouldn't have
let ourselves get carried away.

48:40.083 --> 48:42.669
I mean, what we found might have
been an interesting story,

48:42.753 --> 48:45.088
but it-it doesn't mean
that it was the truth.

48:45.172 --> 48:47.507
-Okay, we'll head back.
-Good.

48:47.591 --> 48:49.593
And bring the key.

48:51.553 --> 48:53.013
MARISSA:
Well, as long as we're here,

48:53.096 --> 48:55.265
we might as well
go ahead with it.

48:55.349 --> 48:57.184
JAY:
Good with me.

49:00.771 --> 49:03.482
MARISSA:
Wow.

49:03.565 --> 49:07.027
Not a lot of room for sex
or sacrifices in here.

49:07.110 --> 49:08.528
(Jay chuckles)

49:08.612 --> 49:10.739
He never threw anything away.

49:10.822 --> 49:14.534
This is what happens
when you die.

49:14.618 --> 49:18.330
You leave everything
for your relatives to clean up.

49:18.413 --> 49:21.708
"Welcome back, Mr. Epstein,
from 34 students

49:21.792 --> 49:26.004
in period-three science class,
the Dalton School."

49:26.088 --> 49:28.715
"Don't lose the fur coat."

49:30.676 --> 49:33.220
So, this is the room
on the blueprint,

49:33.303 --> 49:34.888
the one that read "Bud"?

49:34.971 --> 49:37.724
-Yeah.
-So, where's Bud?

49:37.808 --> 49:40.894
Bud could be anything.
One of the statues.

49:40.977 --> 49:42.688
One of the packages.

49:42.771 --> 49:45.065
Whatever this thing is in here.

49:45.148 --> 49:48.026
We're never gonna get
through all this.

49:55.617 --> 49:57.035
Uh, give me the key.

What?

49:59.371 --> 50:00.664
Look.

50:01.498 --> 50:04.000
(gasps) Oh, my God.

50:04.084 --> 50:07.629
We're solving this.
We are solving this, you and I.

50:08.839 --> 50:11.216
-(exhales)
-Wait, wait, wait.

50:11.299 --> 50:13.802
What do you think
is on the other side?

50:13.885 --> 50:16.888
-Bud.
-Or Epstein.

50:16.972 --> 50:19.641
Bill Barr brought him down here,
and he's alive and hidden,

50:19.725 --> 50:22.018
-like in Parasite.
-Never saw it.

50:22.102 --> 50:25.105
What? How have you not seen it?

50:25.188 --> 50:27.941
-It won the Oscar.
It was a historic win...
-Do you want to open it?

50:28.024 --> 50:29.276
Okay. Yeah.

50:48.545 --> 50:49.755
Okay.

50:52.174 --> 50:54.050
That's how all mysteries end,
don't they?

50:54.134 --> 50:56.970
Empty, pointless, stupid.

50:57.053 --> 51:00.474
We were the stupid ones
for obsessing on "Bud."

51:00.557 --> 51:02.142
It probably had nothing
to do with him.

51:02.225 --> 51:06.146
Just a nickname
for something or someone.

51:06.229 --> 51:07.606
Yeah.

51:07.689 --> 51:10.859
I think we lost track
of the real story.

51:10.942 --> 51:12.736
Mm.

51:12.819 --> 51:15.322
The underage girls.

51:15.405 --> 51:18.992
We were chasing a whodunit
in the middle of a tragedy.

51:24.122 --> 51:26.041
We better go.

51:26.124 --> 51:28.794
-Motorboat is back
in ten minutes.
-Okay.

51:31.213 --> 51:33.465
(sighs)
Bye, Mr. Epstein.

51:33.548 --> 51:34.758
(gong clangs)

51:37.135 --> 51:39.179
Have fun in hell.
