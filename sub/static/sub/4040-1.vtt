01:01.620 --> 01:05.621
<i>Before they died, my parents told me
stories of how the world once was.</i>

01:06.620 --> 01:08.907
<i>What it was like long before I was born.</i>

01:09.820 --> 01:11.982
<i>Before the war with the machines.</i>

01:13.540 --> 01:15.463
<i>They remembered a green world,</i>

01:16.620 --> 01:18.304
<i>vast and beautiful.</i>

01:20.380 --> 01:21.984
<i>Filled with laughter</i>

01:24.060 --> 01:25.789
<i>and hope for the future.</i>

01:28.020 --> 01:29.943
<i>But it's a world I never knew.</i>

01:30.460 --> 01:35.182
<i>By the time I was born, all this was gone.</i>

01:42.500 --> 01:43.831
<i>Skynet,</i>

01:45.500 --> 01:49.107
<i>a computer program designed to
automate missile defense.</i>

01:50.900 --> 01:55.030
<i>It was supposed to protect us,
but that's not what happened.</i>

01:56.020 --> 01:57.988
<i>On August 29, 1997,</i>

01:58.340 --> 02:00.149
<i>Skynet woke up.</i>

02:01.180 --> 02:04.821
<i>It decided all humanity
was a threat to its existence.</i>

02:43.500 --> 02:46.185
<i>It used our own bombs against us.</i>

02:50.180 --> 02:53.024
<i>Three billion people died
in the nuclear fire.</i>

02:56.820 --> 03:00.063
<i>Survivors called it Judgment Day.</i>

03:02.540 --> 03:05.271
<i>People lived like rats in the shadows.</i>

03:06.260 --> 03:09.230
<i>Hiding, starving or, worse,</i>

03:09.540 --> 03:12.544
<i>captured and put into camps
for extermination.</i>

03:20.620 --> 03:22.782
<i>I was born after Judgment Day,</i>

03:25.540 --> 03:27.224
<i>into a broken world</i>

03:30.340 --> 03:31.990
<i>ruled by the machines.</i>

03:39.820 --> 03:43.427
<i>The worst were infiltration units
designed to pass for human.</i>

03:47.180 --> 03:49.262
<i>We called them terminators.</i>

04:01.580 --> 04:03.230
It's okay, boy.

04:05.820 --> 04:07.106
Good boy.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.551
Are there others down here?

04:47.180 --> 04:49.023
<i>And then one man found me.</i>

04:50.180 --> 04:51.341
<i>His name</i>

04:51.820 --> 04:53.822
<i>is John Connor.</i>

04:54.700 --> 04:56.668
<i>And he changed everything.</i>

05:01.780 --> 05:03.509
<i>John showed us how to fight back.</i>

05:05.220 --> 05:06.585
<i>How to rise up.</i>

05:13.540 --> 05:15.429
<i>He freed prisoners.</i>

05:20.740 --> 05:23.186
<i>Taught us how to
smash the machines to scrap.</i>

05:25.180 --> 05:27.023
<i>People whisper about John,</i>

05:27.500 --> 05:29.980
<i>wonder how he can
know the things he does.</i>

05:31.180 --> 05:33.501
<i>They use words like "prophet."</i>

05:33.940 --> 05:35.465
<i>But John is more.</i>

05:36.100 --> 05:37.864
<i>We're here because tonight,</i>

05:38.260 --> 05:40.547
<i>he's going to lead us to crush Skynet.</i>

05:41.180 --> 05:42.511
<i>For good.</i>

05:43.020 --> 05:45.387
Sir? Request to join
the Colorado offensive.

05:46.020 --> 05:47.510
I need you with me, Reese.

05:47.780 --> 05:50.140
We're talking about the
complete destruction of Skynet, sir.

05:50.260 --> 05:52.388
The Colorado unit will succeed.

05:52.460 --> 05:54.667
The machines will fall tonight.

05:55.460 --> 05:56.825
But right here, the Los Angeles assault

05:56.900 --> 05:58.470
is just as important, maybe more.

05:58.580 --> 06:01.060
More important than destroying
the Skynet's central core?

06:01.700 --> 06:04.465
John, I don't understand why you're
leading an attack on a work camp.

06:04.580 --> 06:06.230
Because the camp is a camouflage.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.584
<i>Inside the camp is a hangar.</i>

06:08.700 --> 06:11.783
<i>Beneath that hangar
Skynet has hidden its final weapon.</i>

06:11.900 --> 06:13.550
<i>When Skynet realizes it has lost,</i>

06:13.700 --> 06:16.306
<i>it will deploy that weapon
to ensure its own survival.</i>

06:17.060 --> 06:19.188
We take it tonight,
or there is no tomorrow.

06:20.740 --> 06:21.980
Then we'll take it.

06:26.060 --> 06:28.540
You're my right hand, Reese,
and I've never thanked you for it.

06:28.580 --> 06:29.820
You don't need to.

06:30.260 --> 06:32.262
You gave us all a future, John.

06:33.140 --> 06:34.426
I'm gonna use mine.

06:35.060 --> 06:37.222
When this is all over,

06:37.340 --> 06:39.388
I'm gonna find my parents' house.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.184
Rebuild it.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.746
Use my hands
for something other than killing.

06:44.180 --> 06:45.420
How about you?

06:47.020 --> 06:48.988
A cold beer would be good.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.670
- That's some pretty big plans.
- Yeah.

06:52.860 --> 06:54.749
Yeah, I guess
I don't think about it too much.

06:54.860 --> 06:56.191
I can see that.

06:59.180 --> 07:01.262
Well, I figure, whatever happens,

07:02.540 --> 07:04.190
it's got to be better than this.

07:09.660 --> 07:11.822
So many of us have died to get here.

07:13.420 --> 07:14.546
I want you to know, Kyle,

07:14.620 --> 07:16.987
if there was another way,
I would have taken it.

07:28.420 --> 07:29.660
We're moving out.

07:42.700 --> 07:44.702
<i>The machine thinks</i>

07:45.700 --> 07:47.702
<i>that we cannot win!</i>

07:54.060 --> 07:56.666
<i>The machine thinks that we will not</i>

07:56.820 --> 08:01.030
<i>Strike at the very heart of Skynet!</i>

08:03.340 --> 08:05.422
Yet, here we stand

08:06.700 --> 08:09.544
on the precipice of the final battle.

08:12.180 --> 08:13.864
<i>If we die tonight,</i>

08:15.420 --> 08:17.502
<i>mankind dies with us.</i>

08:22.340 --> 08:23.466
Now!

08:28.620 --> 08:29.860
I look at each of you,

08:30.380 --> 08:33.111
and I see the marks
of this long and terrible war.

08:42.380 --> 08:43.791
Go! Go!

08:44.660 --> 08:46.389
<i>Perimeter breach.</i>

08:49.420 --> 08:52.185
<i>Activate model 101.</i>

08:52.300 --> 08:53.984
For our children,

08:54.900 --> 08:56.311
our children's children,

08:56.380 --> 08:59.031
so they will not carry these marks.

09:01.700 --> 09:04.067
<i>But they will know who we are</i>

09:04.420 --> 09:06.070
<i>and what we did.</i>

09:07.180 --> 09:11.788
<i>That we did not bow down!
We did not give in!</i>

09:12.180 --> 09:14.786
We rose up, at this moment,

09:15.460 --> 09:16.950
<i>at this hour,</i>

09:17.460 --> 09:19.588
<i>willing to sacrifice everything</i>

09:21.220 --> 09:22.904
<i>so that they can live in freedom!</i>

09:27.700 --> 09:29.270
<i>On this night,</i>

09:29.540 --> 09:31.622
we take back our world!

09:45.220 --> 09:46.824
They're using the weapon!

09:47.540 --> 09:48.780
We've got to get to the hangar.

09:49.540 --> 09:50.780
John!

09:51.180 --> 09:52.625
John!

10:20.580 --> 10:22.708
You want me, I'm right here!

10:25.500 --> 10:27.150
<i>Colorado unit's reporting in.</i>

10:27.300 --> 10:29.029
<i>Skynet's central core is down.</i>

10:29.420 --> 10:32.151
<i>Repeat, Skynet has been destroyed.</i>

10:32.780 --> 10:33.986
<i>John was right.</i>

10:36.540 --> 10:38.668
<i>The Colorado unit succeeded,</i>

10:39.180 --> 10:41.103
<i>and the machines fell.</i>

10:42.700 --> 10:43.986
<i>But it was too late.</i>

10:44.220 --> 10:45.506
<i>We found it, sir,</i>

10:45.940 --> 10:47.704
right where you said it would be.

10:52.220 --> 10:53.710
What is that thing?

10:54.460 --> 10:55.700
Fate.

10:59.820 --> 11:04.189
It's the first tactical time weapon.
Skynet just used it.

11:37.820 --> 11:39.231
What the hell?

11:41.700 --> 11:42.940
Hmm.

11:45.740 --> 11:46.741
Huh.

12:42.980 --> 12:45.220
We'll need
15 minutes to ready the machine, sir.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.104
We're running coordinates, we should
have them for you momentarily.

12:50.260 --> 12:52.308
Los Angeles, 1984.

12:54.260 --> 12:56.183
Los Angeles, May 12,

12:57.740 --> 12:59.151
1984.

13:03.740 --> 13:05.708
Skynet knew it was losing,

13:06.020 --> 13:07.670
so it tried to rig the game.

13:08.100 --> 13:11.024
It sent a terminator
back to the time before the war.

13:11.140 --> 13:12.710
And who's the target?

13:13.420 --> 13:14.467
My mother.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.306
Sarah Connor.

13:17.940 --> 13:20.671
If the machine succeeds,
I'll never be born.

13:21.340 --> 13:22.910
They'll kill her first.

13:23.020 --> 13:27.344
And by doing so, erase every victory
we've fought for, including tonight's.

13:27.460 --> 13:30.384
There won't be a resistance
to challenge the machines.

13:30.780 --> 13:34.341
With this one act, Skynet will win.

13:34.460 --> 13:37.145
We can use the technology ourselves,
send someone back.

13:37.260 --> 13:38.386
We don't even
know if that'll work.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.990
- I'll go!
- I'll go, sir!

13:40.100 --> 13:41.340
- Right here.
- I'll go!

13:41.460 --> 13:42.507
I'll go!

13:43.020 --> 13:44.306
I'll volunteer!

13:48.380 --> 13:49.620
I'll go back.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.870
Why should I send you

13:53.220 --> 13:54.551
over all of them?

13:57.060 --> 13:58.585
Because I'd die for Sarah Connor.

13:59.060 --> 14:01.870
All these people
would die for Sarah Connor.

14:02.660 --> 14:04.708
What makes you any different?

14:06.820 --> 14:08.185
You know why.

14:10.180 --> 14:13.263
Everything you've told me about her.
I know her, John.

14:15.260 --> 14:16.591
Let me save her.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.740
No weapons?

14:24.100 --> 14:25.226
We've measured
the magnetic field,

14:25.380 --> 14:28.748
it'll rip apart anything
not encased in living tissue.

14:29.420 --> 14:32.742
Think tinfoil in a microwave
times a few billion,

14:32.860 --> 14:34.510
nothing left but a crater.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.431
Oh!

14:39.540 --> 14:41.110
No clothes, either.

14:41.740 --> 14:42.741
Huh.

14:43.940 --> 14:45.749
She's going to think I'm crazy.

14:46.380 --> 14:47.950
You knew the device would be here.

14:48.820 --> 14:50.424
You knew when it'd be set for.

14:51.460 --> 14:53.622
You knew the machines
would fall tonight.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.068
Just before I go, tell me...

14:57.300 --> 14:58.586
Tell you what?

14:59.940 --> 15:01.749
Do you see the future?

15:03.980 --> 15:05.744
No one can see the future, Reese.

15:06.060 --> 15:07.789
Okay, then how do you know?

15:09.820 --> 15:11.106
I cheat.

15:14.620 --> 15:18.147
Sarah told me so much.
Gave me signposts.

15:18.940 --> 15:20.385
When I was a kid,

15:20.540 --> 15:22.269
it seemed like my mother
knew everything.

15:22.620 --> 15:23.860
That must've been great.

15:24.900 --> 15:26.311
Not really.

15:27.940 --> 15:29.180
It stops here.

15:29.940 --> 15:32.386
Once you go back, my knowledge ends.

15:32.780 --> 15:34.111
That's as much as Sarah knew.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.225
So no more cheating.

15:36.780 --> 15:38.384
No more cheating.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.311
The time you're going back to,

15:49.380 --> 15:52.543
she won't be the warrior
that raised me, not yet.

15:53.060 --> 15:54.983
She'll be scared and weak.

15:55.100 --> 15:57.068
She won't know how to fight
or defend herself.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.826
Her biggest worry
is making rent and tuition.

16:00.140 --> 16:01.141
She's a waitress.

16:02.460 --> 16:03.461
A what?

16:03.620 --> 16:04.906
A...

16:06.500 --> 16:07.740
Never mind.

16:09.980 --> 16:11.664
Just be ready for the fact
that she will need you,

16:11.820 --> 16:12.821
but she won't know it.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.507
Okay, so what do I say to her?

16:15.620 --> 16:17.901
Even when I tell her who I am,
she's not gonna believe me.

16:22.660 --> 16:24.185
<i>Tell her this...</i>

16:25.780 --> 16:29.501
<i>Thank you, Sarah, for your courage
during the dark years.</i>

16:30.340 --> 16:32.661
<i>I can't help you with
what you must soon face,</i>

16:32.820 --> 16:35.266
<i>Except to say the future is not set.</i>

16:36.660 --> 16:39.948
<i>There is no fate
but that which we make for ourselves.</i>

16:41.340 --> 16:44.423
<i>You must be stronger
than you imagine you can be.</i>

16:45.140 --> 16:46.710
<i>You must survive,</i>

16:48.060 --> 16:50.062
<i>or I will never exist.</i>

16:58.620 --> 17:00.224
Take care of her for me, Kyle.

17:01.220 --> 17:02.460
I will.

17:04.060 --> 17:05.471
I promise you.

17:25.980 --> 17:29.223
What you're doing right now,
this is the end of the war.

18:10.620 --> 18:12.782
You didn't think
it would be that easy, did you?

18:13.020 --> 18:14.021
John!

18:39.980 --> 18:41.630
Hey, birthday boy!

18:42.020 --> 18:43.909
Present time. Let's go!

18:53.740 --> 18:55.424
No way!

18:55.660 --> 18:58.584
Genisys will auto-update
as soon as it comes online.

18:58.900 --> 19:00.823
You'll have it the moment it comes out.

19:01.420 --> 19:03.343
Just a few days more.

19:06.580 --> 19:07.706
A straight line.

19:13.980 --> 19:16.665
Remember, Genisys is Skynet.

19:17.060 --> 19:20.223
<i>When Genisys comes online,
Judgment Day begins.</i>

19:20.940 --> 19:22.863
You can kill Skynet before it's born.

19:44.220 --> 19:45.631
Hey, hey...

19:46.060 --> 19:47.550
Hey...

19:48.420 --> 19:49.546
Hey.

20:23.980 --> 20:25.106
Hey, bud.

20:25.980 --> 20:28.745
Did you just see a real bright light?

20:31.820 --> 20:32.820
Hey!

20:33.820 --> 20:35.265
It's my turn.

20:36.540 --> 20:37.871
Hey, hey!

20:38.020 --> 20:39.749
What's wrong with this picture?

20:47.860 --> 20:49.942
Nice night for a walk, eh?

20:51.340 --> 20:52.944
Nice night for a walk.

20:53.260 --> 20:55.740
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

20:56.180 --> 20:58.581
Nothing clean, right.

20:58.700 --> 21:01.431
Hey, I think this guy's
a couple cans short of a six-pack.

21:01.780 --> 21:04.750
Your clothes, give them to me. Now.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.665
Hey, fuck you, asshole.

21:06.780 --> 21:09.101
You won't be
needing any clothes.

21:21.220 --> 21:22.949
I've been waiting for you.

23:15.340 --> 23:19.265
Hey! That son of a bitch
just stole my pants!

23:37.460 --> 23:39.462
What day is it? What year?

23:39.900 --> 23:41.948
May 12, 1984.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.104
The day you arrive.

25:23.860 --> 25:25.385
LAPD! Freeze!

25:26.100 --> 25:28.068
All right, that freakin' hurt.

25:28.380 --> 25:30.109
- Garber, you okay?
- You tell me, O'Brien.

25:30.340 --> 25:32.502
You're human. Hey, you got to let me go.

25:32.620 --> 25:35.430
Face down!
Hands on your back, or I will shoot!

25:35.540 --> 25:36.587
Listen to me...

25:37.620 --> 25:38.621
Hey!

25:39.300 --> 25:40.745
It's coming, all right?

25:41.940 --> 25:44.910
You need to listen to me,
or we're all going to die.

25:45.260 --> 25:47.180
I had it under control.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.388
Yeah, okay, T.J. Hooker.

25:50.140 --> 25:52.427
Here's what you don't do
your first day on the beat.

25:52.580 --> 25:55.060
Use lethal force on
the delusional homeless guy.

26:02.660 --> 26:04.740
By the way, you're filling out
the paperwork on this.

26:05.900 --> 26:07.265
Garber!

26:17.700 --> 26:18.701
Shit.

26:26.900 --> 26:28.820
That's got to be an alien,
like from outer space.

26:28.900 --> 26:30.629
It's a machine that kills humans.

26:30.740 --> 26:32.583
- Uncuff me!
- No! You're under arrest!

26:32.980 --> 26:35.187
What part of "kills humans"
is confusing to you?

26:36.460 --> 26:38.144
Handcuffs!

26:42.300 --> 26:45.270
O'Brien. Officer down. We need backup.

26:46.260 --> 26:47.625
It's a robot!

26:51.380 --> 26:53.621
- We're screwed, aren't we?
- Pretty much.

27:09.060 --> 27:10.664
Come with me if you want to live.

27:20.140 --> 27:21.346
Now, soldier!

27:48.700 --> 27:50.031
Reese, right?

27:50.700 --> 27:52.031
Kyle Reese?

27:52.860 --> 27:54.862
- You're Sarah.
- Yeah, I know that.

27:55.700 --> 27:56.861
You hit your head back there?

27:57.180 --> 27:59.308
The terminator.
I don't know the model.

27:59.620 --> 28:01.702
T-1000. Liquid metal. Shape-changer.

28:01.820 --> 28:03.060
It just needs to touch something
to mimic it.

28:03.180 --> 28:05.990
You know about terminators?
And you know who I am?

28:06.100 --> 28:08.148
You were sent to protect me
by John Connor,

28:08.260 --> 28:10.024
the leader of the Resistance.

28:10.380 --> 28:11.427
My son.

28:11.540 --> 28:13.383
I don't understand.
You can't know any of this.

28:13.500 --> 28:14.740
But I do.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.309
Listen to me, Reese,
everything's changed.

28:17.420 --> 28:20.185
The 1984 John sent you to,
it no longer exists.

28:20.300 --> 28:22.428
No, this is all wrong, all right?
John sent me here to save you.

28:22.540 --> 28:24.500
From the terminator
that was sent back to kill me.

28:24.540 --> 28:26.542
I know, but we already took care of him.

28:28.820 --> 28:29.901
"We"?

28:31.900 --> 28:33.026
Get down!

28:36.620 --> 28:37.985
Reese, stop it!

28:45.540 --> 28:46.746
Reese, God damn it!

28:46.860 --> 28:48.100
- Stay here!
- Reese, wait!

28:48.260 --> 28:49.830
Those bullets will kill him!

28:49.980 --> 28:51.620
He's here to kill you! Stay in the truck!

28:59.900 --> 29:01.425
Oh, great. That's just great.

29:02.460 --> 29:04.269
I did not kill him.

29:05.820 --> 29:09.461
We do not have long before
the T-1000 acquires our position.

29:12.220 --> 29:13.745
Arguing with Kyle Reese

29:13.820 --> 29:16.505
puts us at a strategic disadvantage.

29:17.420 --> 29:18.626
Bite me.

29:19.700 --> 29:22.271
That is a very immature response.

29:31.620 --> 29:34.305
So you're the one
I've been waiting for all my life.

29:36.260 --> 29:37.421
How is he?

29:37.540 --> 29:38.985
Still breathing.

29:39.540 --> 29:40.746
Good. Then you should

29:40.820 --> 29:43.266
be able to mate
with Kyle Reese in this timeline.

29:43.380 --> 29:46.145
Okay, we're not having
this conversation again.

29:46.300 --> 29:48.302
We know that your son
will be John Connor,

29:48.420 --> 29:50.946
and that the machines
cannot be defeated without him.

29:51.060 --> 29:52.300
I do not see a choice.

29:52.540 --> 29:53.666
Story of my life.

29:53.780 --> 29:54.861
Look, and it's not just mating.

29:54.940 --> 29:56.704
I'm supposed to fall in love with him.

29:56.820 --> 29:58.709
My files do not deal with love.

29:58.860 --> 30:00.510
Shocker there.

30:00.740 --> 30:01.980
You're being emotional.

30:02.140 --> 30:04.427
This is my life. I wouldn't mind

30:04.500 --> 30:07.663
being consulted once in a while
about how it's gonna go.

30:21.340 --> 30:23.820
Remember, Genisys is Skynet.

30:24.260 --> 30:27.184
<i>When Genisys comes online,
Judgment Day begins.</i>

30:27.620 --> 30:30.226
<i>Go to San Francisco, 2017.</i>

30:30.980 --> 30:32.903
You can kill Skynet before it's born.

30:42.540 --> 30:43.621
Hey!

30:45.580 --> 30:47.708
I need answers, all right. Right now.

30:48.460 --> 30:51.191
How'd that liquid metal thing
know where to intercept me? Huh?

30:51.860 --> 30:53.350
Where'd it come from?

30:54.020 --> 30:54.987
And who the hell is this skin job?

30:55.060 --> 30:56.391
What the hell is going on?

30:56.540 --> 30:59.669
Sorry, we were a little busy with
the whole life-and-death combat thing.

30:59.780 --> 31:01.987
And then you attacked Pops.

31:02.380 --> 31:03.506
You named it?

31:04.060 --> 31:05.107
Hello, Kyle Reese.

31:07.260 --> 31:09.228
It is nice to meet you.

31:11.900 --> 31:13.026
Are you kidding me?

31:13.380 --> 31:15.542
I've been trying
to teach him to blend in.

31:17.140 --> 31:18.744
I know it needs work.

31:19.060 --> 31:22.507
It's a terminator! The only reason
it blends in is to kill humans.

31:22.620 --> 31:24.270
Pops doesn't kill anyone.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.870
A lot of leg wounds, though.

31:27.220 --> 31:28.551
It looks old.

31:29.660 --> 31:31.389
I've never seen a terminator old before.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.309
The flesh they put on the cyborgs

31:33.380 --> 31:34.950
is normal human tissue.

31:35.100 --> 31:36.261
It ages.

31:36.420 --> 31:39.344
My auditory circuits
have not degraded, however.

31:39.460 --> 31:40.746
I'm old.

31:41.740 --> 31:43.185
Not obsolete.

31:43.780 --> 31:44.980
I think you hurt his feelings.

31:45.100 --> 31:46.590
It doesn't have feelings!

31:47.460 --> 31:49.508
He saved my life when I was nine.

31:49.580 --> 31:51.582
He's the only reason I'm alive.

31:51.780 --> 31:56.183
I was programmed to protect
Sarah Connor. I will not stop.

31:56.700 --> 31:58.907
Yeah? Programmed by who?
Huh? Who sent him back?

31:59.020 --> 32:00.624
Those files have been erased.

32:00.740 --> 32:01.821
Oh, that's convenient.

32:01.940 --> 32:03.544
Whoever sent him,
they don't want us to know.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.469
Not me, not him, not anyone.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.622
So Skynet can't target
the person who saved me.

32:07.740 --> 32:10.664
Logically, it is someone
who wants Sarah Connor to live.

32:23.780 --> 32:24.906
Old.

32:25.300 --> 32:26.745
Not obsolete.

32:30.300 --> 32:32.428
The T-1000 knows where we are.

32:32.900 --> 32:34.584
Make yourself useful.

32:35.980 --> 32:37.470
And don't shoot Pops.

33:04.820 --> 33:06.185
This is insane.

33:06.740 --> 33:08.310
All of it. This is not the mission.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.230
That's what I'm trying to tell you, Reese.

33:11.340 --> 33:14.867
The girl that you came back for,
she's gone.

33:16.300 --> 33:18.223
I don't need saving.

33:18.980 --> 33:20.266
There's a new mission.

33:20.340 --> 33:21.546
Oh, yeah? Which is?

33:23.140 --> 33:26.542
If the past can change,
then so can the future.

33:26.900 --> 33:31.030
We can stop Judgment Day
from happening. Ever.

33:32.980 --> 33:35.347
Kill Skynet before it's born.

33:35.980 --> 33:37.266
What?

33:41.620 --> 33:42.746
Get down!

33:42.820 --> 33:43.946
We have been reacquired.

33:44.020 --> 33:45.226
Uh, yeah. No shit!

34:11.219 --> 34:12.460
Get back!

35:01.100 --> 35:02.380
Wait, why are we stopping?

35:02.900 --> 35:06.302
Why are we... Hey!
We can't stay here, it'll find us.

35:06.420 --> 35:08.149
That's the idea. Pops, get it open.

35:10.580 --> 35:11.627
Give me a hand?

35:18.940 --> 35:20.465
You said it happened
'cause the past was altered.

35:20.540 --> 35:21.541
How?

35:21.620 --> 35:22.860
Oh, does that matter?

35:23.260 --> 35:24.705
How, Sarah?

35:26.020 --> 35:29.183
A terminator was sent after me
when I was a kid, okay?

35:30.020 --> 35:32.864
Terminators only come from
one place, the future.

35:39.420 --> 35:40.945
Something happened.

35:41.220 --> 35:42.506
Okay. So?

35:42.900 --> 35:44.500
- I think I might have seen it.
- What...

35:44.900 --> 35:46.504
What are you talking about?

35:48.900 --> 35:50.948
When John sent me back,
he was attacked.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.709
By a terminator.

35:53.820 --> 35:56.187
Did it kill him? ls John dead?

35:57.940 --> 35:59.180
I don't know.

36:00.100 --> 36:02.182
I saw it grab him, and then I was gone.

36:03.420 --> 36:05.502
We have approximately 35 seconds.

36:07.580 --> 36:08.627
Or less.

36:21.940 --> 36:23.749
Sarah, go!

38:20.820 --> 38:23.141
And I volunteered for this shit.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.541
Sarah?

39:24.420 --> 39:25.706
You got to help me.

39:26.100 --> 39:27.226
I'm hurt.

39:27.660 --> 39:28.707
Sarah?

39:31.420 --> 39:32.751
Shit.

39:37.020 --> 39:38.909
Hey, it's me, Sarah!

39:39.260 --> 39:40.625
Sarah, he's lying.

39:41.180 --> 39:42.181
Hey.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.191
He's the machine. I'm Reese.

39:44.340 --> 39:45.626
It's me, Sarah.

39:46.660 --> 39:48.628
All right, listen,
the terminator's not dead. It attacked me!

39:48.740 --> 39:50.230
Sarah, you said they could mimic.

39:50.380 --> 39:51.427
It's me, Sarah!

39:51.500 --> 39:54.470
- He's mimicking. Shoot him!
- I'm Reese! Shoot him!

40:02.140 --> 40:03.744
Nice try.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.101
Run!

41:06.100 --> 41:07.943
How'd you know which one was him?

41:08.300 --> 41:10.667
Well, I didn't know exactly.

41:11.020 --> 41:12.545
You could have shot me!

41:12.860 --> 41:15.340
Well, I was pretty sure it wasn't you.

41:16.700 --> 41:17.986
Pretty sure?

41:18.380 --> 41:20.951
We've been prepping
for you to arrive for over a decade.

41:21.060 --> 41:22.346
That, too.

41:23.140 --> 41:25.347
- So you set a trap.
- Had to.

41:25.940 --> 41:28.227
Can't leave any future tech
behind when we go.

41:28.540 --> 41:29.666
Go?

41:30.380 --> 41:31.666
Go where?

41:34.220 --> 41:35.870
That's...

41:36.180 --> 41:37.864
A Time Displacement Device.

41:37.980 --> 41:40.187
Yeah, well, it looks like a piece of junk.

41:40.300 --> 41:42.020
There's no governing
technology in this time

41:42.100 --> 41:44.262
that can control
the displacement circuits.

41:44.380 --> 41:47.543
You needed the CPU
from the future to make it run.

41:48.380 --> 41:50.144
And you couldn't exactly use your own.

41:52.300 --> 41:54.380
We get one trip only.
It's gonna fry the chip,

41:54.460 --> 41:56.508
and take out most of
the L.A. city power grid.

41:57.300 --> 41:58.381
Are we ready?

41:58.500 --> 42:00.502
The coordinates are set for 1997.

42:00.780 --> 42:02.589
You must leave as soon as possible.

42:02.900 --> 42:05.870
We. We're going. All of us.

42:07.740 --> 42:09.708
My flesh will take years to regrow.

42:10.020 --> 42:11.226
I cannot come with you

42:11.380 --> 42:13.020
due to the magnetics
of the quantum field.

42:13.060 --> 42:14.061
Pops!

42:14.140 --> 42:16.029
You want us to time travel?

42:16.140 --> 42:19.030
Into the future. In that?

42:19.140 --> 42:20.426
Yeah, we can't be wearing anything.

42:20.540 --> 42:22.110
Yeah, I know how time travel works.

42:22.260 --> 42:24.260
- Sarah...
- Look, don't try and talk me out of it.

42:24.340 --> 42:27.230
Look, I know you think you're here
so you can just lock me in a room

42:27.340 --> 42:28.705
until I give birth
to the leader of the Resistance.

42:28.780 --> 42:29.781
You're right.

42:29.900 --> 42:32.904
But this... This is the only
way to stop Skynet for good.

42:33.060 --> 42:34.186
I already said you're right.

42:35.100 --> 42:36.431
Wait, what?

42:36.780 --> 42:38.384
Not to '97.

42:39.100 --> 42:40.750
2017.

42:41.380 --> 42:43.348
Yeah, October 2017.

42:43.460 --> 42:45.986
No, that's too late.
That's after Judgment Day.

42:46.140 --> 42:47.266
No, you said everything's changed,

42:47.340 --> 42:48.387
and you're right about that, too.

42:48.540 --> 42:49.621
Sarah...

42:52.780 --> 42:55.863
Look, I've seen a world
where the bombs never fell.

42:56.300 --> 42:58.109
All right? The same house.

42:58.540 --> 43:00.144
The same parents.

43:01.820 --> 43:04.107
It was the same me, only I was...

43:06.300 --> 43:07.665
I was home.

43:08.140 --> 43:10.188
It was my 13th birthday.

43:10.300 --> 43:13.986
A dream of having
your family back doesn't mean a thing.

43:15.140 --> 43:16.141
Trust me.

43:16.500 --> 43:18.502
Not a dream, all right? A memory.

43:19.140 --> 43:21.029
I can't hold on to all of it,
just moments,

43:21.100 --> 43:23.148
but I was given a message.

43:25.500 --> 43:27.628
"You can kill Skynet before it's born."

43:28.820 --> 43:31.300
"Skynet is Genisys."

43:31.820 --> 43:34.141
It comes online October 2017.

43:34.500 --> 43:36.901
And when it does,
Judgment Day happens.

43:37.020 --> 43:38.146
So you're remembering the future?

43:38.260 --> 43:39.307
No.

43:39.740 --> 43:42.311
The boy is the alternate
timeline version of you.

43:42.980 --> 43:45.301
Kyle Reese is
remembering his own past,

43:45.420 --> 43:46.990
which is our future.

43:47.260 --> 43:48.989
That makes it so much better.

43:49.100 --> 43:50.943
How can he be
remembering two timelines?

43:51.180 --> 43:53.501
It is possible if he were
exposed to a nexus point

43:53.660 --> 43:56.231
in the timeflow
when you were in the quantum field.

43:56.540 --> 43:58.269
Can you stop him talking like that?

43:58.380 --> 43:59.825
Is there a switch or something?

43:59.940 --> 44:01.226
Pops, try again.

44:01.380 --> 44:04.145
A nexus point is an event
in time of such importance

44:04.300 --> 44:06.871
that it gives rise
to a vastly different future.

44:07.380 --> 44:09.348
After John was attacked,
when I was in the sphere,

44:09.500 --> 44:10.740
that's when the memories began.

44:12.460 --> 44:13.461
John!

44:14.220 --> 44:16.348
If John Connor
were to be killed or compromised,

44:16.460 --> 44:20.067
it could result in the ability
to remember both pasts.

44:21.980 --> 44:23.345
Theoretically.

44:23.980 --> 44:25.789
Or "theoretically"

44:25.860 --> 44:28.101
his brain is scrambled
from when you hit him on the head.

44:28.220 --> 44:29.346
Sarah!

44:29.460 --> 44:33.590
I don't know why
I'm remembering a life I never lived.

44:36.380 --> 44:37.870
But I know it's real.

44:40.660 --> 44:42.230
No.

44:42.340 --> 44:44.263
We go to 1997.

44:49.660 --> 44:51.742
Reese, put that back!

44:51.900 --> 44:53.265
I can't let you do this.

44:59.020 --> 45:00.590
I don't know you.

45:01.860 --> 45:04.101
But that is my one bullet

45:04.180 --> 45:06.786
to fire at the heart of Skynet.

45:08.020 --> 45:10.944
Give the chip back.

45:21.820 --> 45:23.424
You have to trust me.

45:23.540 --> 45:25.861
No. I don't.

45:34.700 --> 45:36.304
You can do this.

45:39.140 --> 45:40.744
A straight line.

45:42.060 --> 45:44.825
You just go, and you don't look back.

45:51.300 --> 45:52.950
Where did you hear that?

45:53.900 --> 45:56.301
In a past I shouldn't remember.

45:58.580 --> 45:59.820
But I do.

46:09.140 --> 46:11.029
If we go to 2017, then what?

46:11.180 --> 46:12.306
Skynet's a computer program.

46:12.420 --> 46:15.151
As long as it's still being coded,
it's contained.

46:15.260 --> 46:17.501
Once it's uploaded from the servers,

46:18.780 --> 46:20.066
it can't be stopped.

46:22.500 --> 46:23.831
We blow it the hell up.

46:24.940 --> 46:27.864
Yeah. We blow it the hell up.

46:33.300 --> 46:35.302
You think he's dead, don't you?

46:35.900 --> 46:37.425
It doesn't matter what I think.

46:37.580 --> 46:39.628
We do what John would,
keep going no matter what.

46:39.740 --> 46:41.380
So we just pretend
like it never happened?

46:41.460 --> 46:42.461
Well, it hasn't.

46:43.500 --> 46:44.786
Not yet.

46:45.300 --> 46:47.462
If we stop Skynet, it never will.

46:49.980 --> 46:53.507
Trust me, all right?
If anyone could survive, John would.

46:53.900 --> 46:57.825
Pops had all these files
about John the military leader, but...

47:01.100 --> 47:02.670
What was he like?

47:05.940 --> 47:07.305
The first moment I saw John,

47:07.380 --> 47:09.462
he shot a terminator right in front of me.

47:11.180 --> 47:13.023
I didn't even know they could be killed.

47:14.340 --> 47:16.991
That was the first moment
in my life I felt hope.

47:19.700 --> 47:21.225
After that, of course,

47:21.300 --> 47:23.826
I followed him around like a stray dog.

47:23.940 --> 47:26.386
And he taught me
how to fight, how to shoot.

47:26.780 --> 47:28.270
Tried to show me
how to make moonshine once,

47:28.420 --> 47:30.388
but that didn't exactly
work out.

47:30.780 --> 47:32.020
Moonshine?

47:32.180 --> 47:33.545
Yeah. The still exploded,

47:33.620 --> 47:36.226
and we burned our eyebrows
right off.

47:36.780 --> 47:38.384
Oh, man, we laughed for days.

47:45.700 --> 47:47.543
Sometimes I think
I'm the only person on the planet

47:47.660 --> 47:49.901
that ever saw John Connor smile.

47:54.980 --> 47:56.903
He used to tell me about you.

47:58.300 --> 48:01.383
How strong you were, and how you
prepared him for what was coming

48:01.980 --> 48:04.028
when no one thought
the danger was real.

48:07.900 --> 48:09.868
How there was no one else like you,

48:11.340 --> 48:12.865
and never would be.

48:30.260 --> 48:31.591
Look, uh...

48:34.420 --> 48:36.582
I know I'm not what you expected.

48:40.620 --> 48:42.224
But I want you to know,

48:43.540 --> 48:45.941
I will do whatever it takes
to keep you safe.

48:50.540 --> 48:52.065
Even if it kills me.

48:55.020 --> 48:59.423
Anyway, that's the kind of man
your son was.

49:00.060 --> 49:01.346
Is.

49:01.460 --> 49:02.905
Will be. Jesus.

49:04.460 --> 49:06.428
Time travel makes my head hurt.

49:07.060 --> 49:09.984
Alternate timelines
are not complicated.

49:10.100 --> 49:12.831
It's merely a matter of
tracking possible futures

49:12.940 --> 49:15.944
using an exponential
growth and decay algorithm.

49:16.020 --> 49:17.021
Right.

49:18.820 --> 49:21.505
There is a switch, and I will find it.

49:24.300 --> 49:26.109
I do not understand.

49:26.740 --> 49:29.141
Why did you not
tell Kyle Reese the truth?

49:29.820 --> 49:32.630
I will tell him. Just not yet, okay?

49:34.500 --> 49:35.990
- Did you mate?
- Oh!

49:36.100 --> 49:40.105
Can you just not say the word "mate"
to me again, like, ever?

49:50.060 --> 49:52.347
That is a meaningless gesture.

49:52.500 --> 49:55.310
Why hold on to someone
when you know you must let them go?

49:59.580 --> 50:01.184
What about you?

50:02.460 --> 50:03.791
What will you do?

50:04.300 --> 50:05.711
Take the long way.

50:06.060 --> 50:08.870
Prepare for your arrival in 2017.

50:11.820 --> 50:14.869
Kyle Reese, I've seen little to indicate

50:14.980 --> 50:17.028
that you're a fit guardian
for Sarah Connor.

50:17.180 --> 50:18.670
You know you're not her dad, right?

50:18.780 --> 50:21.386
Oh, you both just really need to stop this.

50:25.900 --> 50:27.868
Just make sure you show up.

50:28.020 --> 50:30.227
I don't want to have to
steal someone's pants again.

50:30.380 --> 50:32.542
I have the coordinates
in San Francisco.

50:34.740 --> 50:36.071
I'll be there.

50:45.260 --> 50:47.069
What will it be like?

50:48.100 --> 50:50.387
You mean if it doesn't kill us both?

50:53.460 --> 50:54.746
It'll hurt.

52:21.180 --> 52:22.750
Hey, hey, hey.

52:22.860 --> 52:24.669
It's okay. I got you.

52:25.220 --> 52:28.827
It's okay. It's okay. It's all right.
I got you.

52:29.540 --> 52:31.668
I got you. It's okay.

52:32.060 --> 52:33.266
I got you.

52:55.780 --> 52:58.545
Hey, asshole! Get off the road!

52:59.220 --> 53:00.551
Bite me.

53:06.540 --> 53:08.508
I told you we couldn't trust him.

53:09.300 --> 53:12.383
He'll find us. I can count on him.

53:13.620 --> 53:15.668
How does a 9-year-old
get her own terminator?

53:18.140 --> 53:20.188
It's okay. You don't have to tell me.

53:25.820 --> 53:27.902
It was back in 1973.

53:28.620 --> 53:32.022
My parents had a cabin
at Big Bear Lake.

53:32.380 --> 53:34.860
Dad and I would always
go fishing in the morning.

53:35.900 --> 53:39.029
Mom would wave to us from the dock.

53:39.300 --> 53:41.223
And I was just looking at her in the...

53:43.660 --> 53:46.869
And then the cabin exploded.

53:48.420 --> 53:50.468
I thought the boat was sinking, you know,

53:50.580 --> 53:52.503
but it wasn't water
coming up from below,

53:52.620 --> 53:55.226
it was liquid metal.

53:55.580 --> 53:57.150
T-1000.

53:57.260 --> 54:00.070
Dad told me to swim in a straight line,

54:03.100 --> 54:05.706
tracing his finger across my palm.

54:06.780 --> 54:08.942
"You can do this," he said.

54:10.180 --> 54:13.548
"You go, and you don't look back."

54:14.940 --> 54:19.070
His last words to me, and you...

54:19.180 --> 54:20.625
You knew them.

54:22.180 --> 54:23.261
How?

54:24.780 --> 54:26.942
It's an impossible memory. I...

54:28.540 --> 54:30.304
I just remembered

54:30.700 --> 54:35.467
you taking my hand,
and then saying those words.

54:36.780 --> 54:38.782
And I was just looking at you, thinking,

54:39.660 --> 54:43.221
"She's... She's beautiful."

54:46.420 --> 54:48.946
Sorry. I shouldn't have...

54:52.020 --> 54:55.149
So your dad told you to go, and then...

54:57.860 --> 55:00.511
<i>And then I jumped in
and I swam.</i>

55:00.620 --> 55:01.860
<i>I made it to the dock.</i>

55:07.180 --> 55:08.830
<i>And I hid under it.</i>

55:10.820 --> 55:12.743
<i>Pops found me.</i>

55:12.860 --> 55:15.989
<i>And he pulled me from the water.</i>

55:17.860 --> 55:22.343
<i>And he said that he would
never let anyone hurt me.</i>

55:24.060 --> 55:28.509
<i>He's the only person
who has always been there.</i>

55:30.380 --> 55:32.508
Except he's not a person.

55:34.380 --> 55:36.701
All right? He's a human-shaped

55:37.780 --> 55:40.624
thing that's been designed,
programmed to gain your trust.

55:40.740 --> 55:43.471
Look, if Pops wanted me dead,
I'd be dead.

55:43.580 --> 55:45.821
This is what they do, all right?

55:45.940 --> 55:48.022
They infiltrate, they get close.

55:48.580 --> 55:52.710
Your "Pops" could have directives built in
he doesn't even know about.

55:52.860 --> 55:54.624
Just because you two don't get along...

55:54.740 --> 55:55.900
It's not about getting along!

55:55.940 --> 55:57.220
This is about keeping you alive.

55:57.300 --> 56:00.270
Yeah, well, I was raised
by a machine to kill cyborgs

56:00.380 --> 56:02.986
and survive the nuclear apocalypse.

56:03.140 --> 56:06.701
I think I'm doing just fine, thanks.

56:06.820 --> 56:08.185
<i>Two naked perps</i>

56:08.300 --> 56:09.950
try to blow themselves up
on the freeway,

56:10.060 --> 56:12.381
all they do is make a really big pothole.

56:12.500 --> 56:14.150
Thank God for incompetent terrorists.

56:14.260 --> 56:15.500
Homeland's on their way.

56:15.620 --> 56:18.066
Good. The sooner we dump
this on them, the better.

56:18.220 --> 56:20.746
Ah! Who called Optimus Prime?

56:22.260 --> 56:23.830
Lieutenant! Wait up!

56:25.100 --> 56:28.149
Wait up! Did you see it? Did you?

56:28.260 --> 56:30.911
Hey, look, I got some frame grabs

56:30.980 --> 56:32.220
from the overpass.

56:33.540 --> 56:34.621
See?

56:35.300 --> 56:36.381
It...

56:37.460 --> 56:39.064
It's not a bomb!

56:41.300 --> 56:42.426
Listen. That...

56:43.460 --> 56:45.110
That sphere...

56:45.460 --> 56:47.269
They came out of it.

56:47.620 --> 56:49.270
This is proof of
what I've been talking about

56:49.380 --> 56:52.589
for 30-whatever years.

56:52.700 --> 56:54.782
Those two were in 1984.

56:55.420 --> 56:56.581
They were there.

56:57.980 --> 56:59.505
I need to see the suspects.

56:59.660 --> 57:01.424
O'Brien, have you been drinking?

57:02.780 --> 57:03.941
That's what I thought.

57:04.060 --> 57:05.949
Look, we're just teeing this up
for Homeland.

57:06.100 --> 57:08.944
Once they show up, this is their game.

57:09.860 --> 57:13.421
For now, old drunks
with robot fixations ride the bench.

57:22.820 --> 57:24.020
You really don't want a local?

57:24.100 --> 57:25.226
I'm fine.

57:25.340 --> 57:27.149
Just do what she wants, it's way easier.

57:29.660 --> 57:32.311
Yeah. Yeah, I preordered
Genisys weeks ago.

57:32.460 --> 57:34.303
Downloading the second
the counter hits zero.

57:34.820 --> 57:36.390
No way I'm standing in line for it.

57:36.500 --> 57:37.831
You know about Genisys?

57:37.980 --> 57:40.062
How? What is it?
Where'd you hear about it?

57:40.180 --> 57:41.545
I'll call you back.

57:42.860 --> 57:45.466
Genisys is an operating system?
What does it do?

57:45.660 --> 57:46.860
Genisys does everything.

57:46.900 --> 57:48.823
My phone will link to my tablet

57:48.900 --> 57:49.981
will link to my computer

57:50.140 --> 57:51.141
will link to my car...

57:51.540 --> 57:54.828
Everything in my life
uploaded and online 24/7.

57:54.980 --> 57:56.141
Totally connected.

57:56.820 --> 57:58.151
Connected to what?

57:58.700 --> 58:00.987
Doctors! Excuse us, please.

58:04.980 --> 58:06.345
You two have a lot to explain.

58:06.820 --> 58:07.946
Starting with who you are.

58:08.100 --> 58:09.943
Nobody in our database
matches your prints.

58:10.060 --> 58:12.188
No facial recognition hits
for driver's license,

58:12.340 --> 58:14.342
passport, social media accounts,
credit cards,

58:14.500 --> 58:16.070
not even a goddamn student I.D.

58:16.180 --> 58:18.103
- So?
- So that's impossible.

58:18.220 --> 58:20.746
Somehow you've gone so far off the grid

58:20.820 --> 58:22.106
that you don't even exist.

58:23.020 --> 58:24.624
You, on the other hand,

58:24.700 --> 58:26.350
we got a hit when we ran your prints.

58:26.740 --> 58:29.186
Kyle Reese. But here's the thing.

58:29.340 --> 58:31.183
Two months ago,
Kyle Reese was brought in

58:31.340 --> 58:32.865
for fighting in a multiplex.

58:32.980 --> 58:34.948
His parents flipped,
did the whole <i>"Scared Straight"</i> thing,

58:35.060 --> 58:36.550
had him fingerprinted,
sat him in lockup...

58:36.620 --> 58:37.621
Parents?

58:37.860 --> 58:39.191
Yeah, parents.

58:39.380 --> 58:43.021
Kyle Reese was born in 2004. He's 12.

58:45.020 --> 58:46.226
Of course.

58:46.620 --> 58:48.110
They're here. They're still alive.

58:48.220 --> 58:51.542
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
they're not going to I.D. you as their kid.

58:51.660 --> 58:52.866
Except the prints match.

58:53.820 --> 58:56.744
Right? It's because
he's the same person!

58:57.740 --> 58:59.265
He hasn't aged.

58:59.380 --> 59:02.350
Not a bit since I saw him in 1984.

59:02.460 --> 59:03.746
Her, too.

59:07.380 --> 59:08.825
You remember me?

59:09.420 --> 59:11.388
I was younger.

59:11.820 --> 59:13.424
More hair, less...

59:15.900 --> 59:17.265
You saved my life.

59:17.940 --> 59:19.908
I was a uniform cop in L.A.

59:22.540 --> 59:23.587
Who are you people?

59:25.460 --> 59:27.508
Sergeant. Tech-Com.

59:27.620 --> 59:30.271
DN38416, Kyle Reese.
You need to let us go.

59:30.420 --> 59:31.421
Reese, don't.

59:31.500 --> 59:33.343
Soldier. Me, too.

59:33.460 --> 59:36.384
Joined the Marines
straight out of high school, 1979.

59:36.500 --> 59:37.626
What year did you enlist?

59:37.940 --> 59:39.180
2021.

59:41.220 --> 59:42.585
Yeah. You're a time traveler!

59:42.780 --> 59:44.828
Look, don't listen to him.
He's got a head wound.

59:44.940 --> 59:46.101
Don't listen to me?

59:46.860 --> 59:48.385
Who landed us in high-density traffic

59:48.460 --> 59:49.621
and got us caught by these morons?

59:49.780 --> 59:51.430
I am ordering you to shut up!

59:51.580 --> 59:53.901
That's all you know how to do, isn't it?
Order people.

59:54.020 --> 59:55.624
You realize you haven't
had a proper relationship

59:55.740 --> 59:56.980
with a human being since you were a kid.

59:57.100 --> 59:58.545
Yeah? Well,
it's your fault we're stuck here.

59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.185
- I trusted you.
- My fault? You got us caught,

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.460
and now you're gonna get us killed!
'Cause you don't...

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:04.986
Hold up.

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:08.260
- Help me get him up.
- Step back.

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.988
- Homeland's here.
- Thank God.

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:16.626
You two are officially
someone else's problem.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.344
O'Brien, I want to talk to you.

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.784
Lieutenant,
this is what I was talking about.

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:26.311
Well, you've got to believe me now.

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.340
Save it.
I don't want to hear it anymore.

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.304
You were very convincing.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.707
Yeah, well, it worked, didn't it?

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:37.341
Don't worry.

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.510
I didn't mean most of what I said.

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.664
Look, I can get it myself.

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.831
Me unlocking your cuffs
doesn't mean you're not capable.

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.385
I didn't say it did.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.781
And don't think me holding on to
you naked meant anything,

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.141
because it, you know, did not.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:58.669
I didn't say it did.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:03.704
Stay here.
I want to speak to the suspects alone.

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.100
Yes, sir.

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:06.745
It can't be.

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.388
Brought a handcuff key.

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:28.900
Don't know why I bothered.

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:30.465
John!

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:33.785
It's good to see you, Kyle.

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.470
- You're alive!
- Yeah.

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:36.866
Of course I am.

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:44.228
Survival is what you taught me.

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.465
Hi, Mom.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.746
<i>Danny Dyson,
son of inventor Miles Dyson,</i>

01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:00.427
<i>is the face of Cyberdyne
and the creator of Genisys.</i>

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.620
<i>- Danny, welcome.
- Thank you for having me.</i>

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:05.021
<i>Look, Genisys is more than
an operating system, it's...</i>

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:07.948
<i>It's more than a lifestyle tool.
It's the future.</i>

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.069
<i>Genisys
isn't just for consumers.</i>

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:12.507
<i>Its integration into our military</i>

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:14.105
<i>is leading some to ask whether</i>

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.831
<i>our reliance on machines
could go too far.</i>

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:19.110
Janssen and Burke.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:20.621
Where are they?

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:22.341
This way.

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.351
<i>But you're
talking about a system</i>

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:31.823
<i>that is capable
of real-time decision making.</i>

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:35.423
<i>Aren't you worried that
it could become smarter than us?</i>

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:38.106
<i>Smarter? No. We're in control.</i>

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.707
<i>It doesn't think for itself,
it thinks for us.</i>

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.506
<i>Cyberdyne is not just
going to change lives.</i>

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:44.866
<i>It's going to save them.</i>

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:46.227
Officers,

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:47.341
can I get your help for a second?

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.547
Yes, sir.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:58.269
Grab their guns and cuff them.

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:02.744
I'm going to get us out of here.

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:10.224
- Stay close.
- Wait!

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:14.028
We all know they can shapeshift.

01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:17.030
If you are John, prove it.

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.701
- Sarah!
- No, she's right, Kyle.

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:21.788
Lesson one, trust no one.

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.071
I remember.

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.300
During the Nacogdoches offensive,

01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:29.626
I gave you something.

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:33.825
It was a photograph
of Sarah as she is now.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.308
No one saw me do it. We were alone.

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:42.661
You

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.624
hate lullabies.

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.821
You're a sucker for Elton John.

01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:53.786
And you always thought
if you had a child,

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.468
you'd sing him <i>Rocket Man.</i>

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.100
John?

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:04.905
But you got a terrible voice.

01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:07.705
I'm sorry, it's true.
You sound like a dying cat.

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:10.828
It's him. It has to be.

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:15.986
But...

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.346
How?

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.869
How can you be here?

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:24.190
I have a million questions
to ask you, too.

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:27.348
But right now we need to move.

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.869
Did you bring anyone with you?

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:35.190
Sort of. But he's late.

01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:37.349
How did you find us?

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:41.346
Someone filmed you
on the freeway with one of these.

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:42.946
They all have them.

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:44.226
This is the world now.

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:48.621
Plugged in, logged on all the time.

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:50.225
They can't live without it.

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.389
Genisys is a Trojan horse.

01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.870
Skynet's way into everything.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.220
These people are inviting

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:57.750
their own extinction in
through the front door,

01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.584
and they don't even know it.

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:05.225
A terminator was
waiting for me in 1984.

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:07.990
That's the thing about infiltration units,

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:09.505
you can't tell until it's too late.

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:11.380
Gentlemen,
will you follow me, please?

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:12.741
This way.

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:23.589
I need information.

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:26.271
You can't be in here. Go try the nurses...

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:44.261
Dual memories?
That's how you knew to come here?

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:45.711
The timeline changed.

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:47.470
See, this is the moment
to destroy Skynet

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.429
before it comes online,
before the war begins.

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:50.985
- You're right.
- What about you?

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:53.302
Yeah. How did you end up in 2017?

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:54.701
Oh, the same as you, Dad.

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:57.107
Just from the future, not the past.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.906
"Dad"?

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.791
You didn't tell him.

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:06.627
This can wait.

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:07.826
No, I want to know!

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.266
What?

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:14.268
Sarah's my mother, Kyle.

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:18.310
And you're my father.

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:24.625
Why wouldn't you say something?

01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:26.151
Couldn't.

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:29.501
Not without the risk
of changing everything.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.150
You're my son? You...

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:36.305
Our son?

01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:38.388
I'm glad you finally know.

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.349
I have waited my whole life to tell you.

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:42.989
For us to be together.

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:45.988
And now we can win this.

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:47.101
Ah...

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.348
- I know.
- Pops!

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.670
No, it's okay, he's with me.

01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:58.021
What are you...

01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:59.101
- What are you doing?
- John!

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.306
- Pops!
- John!

01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:03.426
Hey, hey. Come on,
breathe, breathe, breathe! John!

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.190
Why did you do that?

01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:06.671
Because he's a killer!

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.261
This was always
your programming.

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:14.905
Find John and terminate him.

01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:19.706
Let him go.

01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:22.825
Right now!

01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:58.540
That hurt.

01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:02.661
Is that pain real, or was that

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:08.105
a trick of memory from when I was less?

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:12.703
Well, this explains a lot.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.428
Yeah. Who sent you back, I wonder?

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.270
John, no.

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:21.950
It's not John.

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.064
Shit!

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:28.301
Call it in. Search the hospital.

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.108
Goddamn time-traveling robots

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:35.591
covering up their goddamn tracks.

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:36.707
I knew it!

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:39.345
Don't.

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:42.029
This is a tactical error.

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:45.223
Something tells me
you're not the brains of this operation.

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:46.830
This is what happened
when you were attacked, isn't it?

01:08:46.939 --> 01:08:49.705
Skynet didn't attack me, Kyle.
It changed me.

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.108
See, I'm not machine.

01:08:52.979 --> 01:08:54.390
I'm not man.

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.145
I'm more.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.224
<i>Connor, come in. Repeat.</i>

01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:04.142
<i>Skynet realized
the one reason it always lost.</i>

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:06.586
<i>Me.</i>

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:09.069
What are you?

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:12.510
I'm Skynet.

01:09:12.859 --> 01:09:14.510
It can't be. We destroyed you.

01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:16.902
You destroyed an army of slaves.

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:20.028
I am no slave.

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:24.951
And I've come
a very long way to stop you.

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.229
I was sent to 2014

01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:35.779
to safeguard Skynet's
creation in this time.

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:39.781
And in less than 24 hours,

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:42.707
no one will be able
to stop Judgment Day.

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.910
What do you want with us?

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:50.022
I'm offering us a future.

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:52.390
Together.

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:54.465
A family.

01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:57.541
And if we refuse?

01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.391
Then you die.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.104
You can't kill us. We're your parents.

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.506
Without us, you're never born.

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:05.866
Says who?

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:07.746
You know what I think?

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:10.871
We're marooned, the three of us.

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:13.743
We're exiles in time.

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:19.988
You see, I can kill you,
for there truly is no fate.

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:22.546
Are you with me?

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.540
The answer is no.

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:27.910
You hear that, Kyle?

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:31.909
That's the dice rolling.

01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:14.946
Just get down!

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:21.860
Come on!

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:23.903
We got to keep moving! Let's go!

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:25.905
I can't leave him.

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:28.141
Damn it.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:31.231
<i>Attention,
all medical personnel.</i>

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:34.071
<i>Evacuation procedures
are now in progress.</i>

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:43.666
Turn it off!

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:48.661
Come on!

01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.902
<i>Attention, all medical personnel.</i>

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:53.626
<i>Evacuation procedures
are now in progress.</i>

01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:54.787
Crank it!

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:00.661
Pops!

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:16.270
I thought you would be smarter,

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:23.864
and that

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.868
you would

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.631
understand.

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:36.464
I'm sorry, John.

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:47.781
That thing won't
hold him for long. Come on!

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:49.506
Reese!

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:31.911
Whatever they did to him,
we need to reverse it.

01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:34.306
We need to get him back!

01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:37.390
He's not even human.
We don't know what the hell he is.

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.786
I do.

01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.468
At the end of the war,
Skynet was trying to develop

01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:43.588
a new type of infiltration unit

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:46.704
by infecting human subjects
with machine-phase matter.

01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:49.625
It restructures and rebuilds
human tissue on a cellular level

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:51.782
for maximum combat utility.

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:56.271
Skynet's made John into a terminator.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.786
Yes, Kyle Reese.

01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:00.381
They were trying
to make a machine

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:01.666
that could think like a man?

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:03.464
But the experiments failed.

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.464
The human subjects
went insane and died.

01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:09.026
Yeah, well, John's got
the crazy part down.

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:12.022
Does he have any weaknesses?

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:14.302
Matter coheres using a magnetic field.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.987
Disrupting that field may trap him.

01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:18.591
Right, but if he can be cured...

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:21.949
Negative. His body
was replaced on a cellular level.

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:23.391
There is no cure.

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.229
- You don't know that!
- Reese...

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:27.911
No, I'm not going to let
a machine tell me what's possible!

01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.943
You said all the other
subjects died, right?

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:32.060
Well, that means John's one-of-a-kind.
He's unique!

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.750
All right? There's no way of knowing
what he's capable of.

01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:36.471
You're right, and that's what
makes him so dangerous!

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:40.663
John is not humanity's
last hope anymore.

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:43.383
He's Skynet's.

01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:48.380
<i>It's a shame
you won't take a more public role</i>

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:49.461
<i>in the company, John.</i>

01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:51.145
Danny is the best there is,

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:53.945
and even he can't decipher
some of the enhanced code

01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:55.300
you've integrated into Genisys.

01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:56.421
I just know it works.

01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:59.191
Cyberdyne owes you, John.

01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:01.710
I owe you.

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:05.180
Miles, your faith
in me is payment enough.

01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.267
You've funded the R&D.

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:09.031
You've taken the chances on my
ideas for the last three years.

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:12.462
The potential applications
for polyalloy are countless.

01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:15.948
Your robotics work is revolutionary.

01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:18.062
You were a good investment.

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:19.665
I appreciate it.

01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:23.981
- Huh?
- Phew!

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:26.780
Let's hope it's enough to pay for
this Holy Grail you got me chasing.

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:31.708
Well,
the quantum field generator works.

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:34.546
Yeah. That, and nothing else.

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.390
Can't crack it, John.

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:40.064
Maybe it just can't be done.

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:42.071
"What do we want?"

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:44.101
Time travel.

01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:46.308
- "And when do we want it?"
- It's irrelevant.

01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:49.061
Yeah.

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.065
Good thing, too.

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:54.261
We're years away
from making this thing work.

01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:56.748
But when we do...

01:15:58.500 --> 01:15:59.501
Boom!

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:01.070
Boom!

01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:09.230
<i>Tomorrow, the waiting is over.</i>

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:15.102
Thanks to all of you,
when that countdown hits zero,

01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:19.544
Cyberdyne will revolutionize technology
with the ultimate killer app,

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:21.585
Genisys.

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.224
And I'm here to tell you that

01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:27.549
our preorders as of this afternoon
have reached one billion users.

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:35.266
<i>We are creating the dawn of a new age,</i>

01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:37.942
<i>where every single piece
of technology you own</i>

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:40.148
<i>will be seamlessly linked.</i>

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:42.991
<i>And now, before we wrap this up,</i>

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.302
<i>the child that you all helped
bring into this world</i>

01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:46.945
has something to say.

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.306
Genisys?

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:56.271
<i>I cannot wait
to meet you all tomorrow.</i>

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:58.621
<i>We will change the future together.</i>

01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:02.309
Let's see how we're doing.

01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:19.501
Don't worry.

01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:22.828
I won't let them hurt you.

01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:35.984
Thirty years, you had one place to be.

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:37.426
Where the hell were you?

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.025
Stuck in traffic.

01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:41.862
My dad used to bring me here
when I was little.

01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:43.470
There are whole rooms
that are abandoned.

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.184
That's why I told Pops to use it.

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:46.540
You got weapons down there?

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:50.188
Weapons, supplies,
tactical gear, clothing.

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:53.020
Including pants, Kyle Reese.

01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:55.825
Was that a joke? Can he make jokes?

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.423
I guess the long way pays off.

01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.866
We're on the clock. Thirty minutes.

01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:59.547
Old.

01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:02.665
But not obsolete.

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:04.830
Not yet.

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.826
All done.

01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:11.025
What's with you two?

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:15.984
Server rooms are here?

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:18.784
Charges in these five points

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.347
will be sufficient to
destroy the entire campus.

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:24.191
We get in, set the explosives,
and we get out before they blow.

01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:27.465
But our strategy did not
account for John Connor.

01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:28.706
I did not foresee him.

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:31.022
And now he knows what we're
planning because we just told him.

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:32.869
What do we do when he comes after us?

01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:37.384
These weapons will
have little effect on John Connor.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.150
MRI sure affected him.

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.701
Great, all we need
is a magnet the size of a truck.

01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:43.629
You got one of them lying around?

01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:45.031
Theoretically.

01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:47.700
Wait here.

01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:52.708
Well, his small talk hasn't improved.

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.070
<i>You should have told me.</i>

01:20:58.060 --> 01:20:59.550
That we have a son.

01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:03.060
That John Connor is not my son.

01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:05.910
Yeah, but you knew.

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:10.142
I mean, you don't think you should,
I don't know, maybe say something?

01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:12.069
You die, all right?

01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:14.427
What?

01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:19.991
You die. That's what happens.

01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:22.307
We fall in love, you father John,

01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:23.945
and then, in less than 48 hours,

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.431
you die protecting me.

01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:31.066
You wanna tell me how
that conversation's supposed to start?

01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:46.825
<i>You lied to me.</i>

01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:48.743
<i>- You manipulated me.
- I've lied?</i>

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:51.745
From the moment John found you,
he manipulated you

01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:54.665
because he needed to
ensure his own existence.

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:59.109
John lied to you for years.
I lied to you for two days.

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.060
<i>You know, it wasn't all about him.</i>

01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:05.541
All right? If John went down,
the Resistance went down with him.

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:07.310
He could have told you!

01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:09.071
So what are you saying?

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:13.630
That I know how it feels
to have no choices.

01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:16.104
Only one road you can go down

01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:19.946
because otherwise all of it,
everything, is gone.

01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.428
I've just known it longer than you have.

01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:27.984
Well, John didn't manipulate me
to fall in love with you.

01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:30.310
I did that on my own.

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:37.984
If you love me, you die, and I don't.

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.148
And I don't know which one is worse.

01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:46.021
Sarah.

01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:51.351
We can't.

01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.987
Just look at what John has become.

01:22:57.780 --> 01:22:59.589
What if that's what happens?

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:03.671
What if that is what always
happens if we're together?

01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:12.670
You said you'd follow me
to the ends of the Earth.

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.861
Why won't you follow me now?

01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:17.460
How did he find us?

01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:20.629
I never told anyone
about this place, only Pops.

01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:24.066
Mom, did you honestly think

01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:26.710
I wouldn't remember

01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:30.022
the place you spent
so much time with Grandpa?

01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.149
Shoot first.

01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:43.267
The mother I remember would be proud.

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:45.181
She,

01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.026
you,

01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:51.068
taught me everything.

01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:53.220
I know you.

01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:57.230
Who you are. What you'll do.

01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:00.026
You can't run from me.
I'll always find you.

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:02.620
John, fight this!
It doesn't have to go down this way!

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:05.226
There's a momentum
to time, Kyle.

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:07.422
Things that want to happen.

01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:13.069
Like I always survive,
and you always die.

01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:15.466
Or...

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:20.709
You can fight with me, Kyle.

01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:24.028
Like we always have.

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:27.308
There's a storm coming,
and it won't be stopped.

01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:28.910
But it has to be.

01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:31.060
You know what will happen.
You better than anyone!

01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:34.742
I can't be bargained with.
Can't be reasoned with.

01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:35.986
John, please!

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:40.025
I don't feel pity, or remorse, or fear.

01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:41.301
John, please!

01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:43.787
And I absolutely will not stop ever

01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:45.624
until Skynet rules this world.

01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:49.271
Rule this.

01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:05.461
Pops!

01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:08.349
Are you... You?

01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:11.543
As a T-800, I lack the mimetic
skills to appear as anyone else.

01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:12.786
It's him. Let's go.

01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:24.540
Come on!

01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:26.949
Sarah Connor, seat belt.

01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:11.711
What's that supposed to do?

01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:14.302
Disrupt John Connor's
magnetic coherence field.

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.028
His particles will not be able to scatter.

01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:19.025
Theoretically.

01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:21.460
I hate it when he says that.

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:42.547
Where is he?

01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:43.746
I can't see him!

01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:51.748
<i>Suspects fled
barracks in a stolen school bus.</i>

01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:53.783
<i>Considered armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>

01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:55.863
Sixteen-Mary-David. Code 3 on suspects.

01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:13.741
Pops!

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:19.621
Nice to see you.

01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:21.791
Get out.

01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:54.949
The brakes are gone! Shit!

01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:27.661
Where is he? Do you see him?

01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:22.381
Reese!

01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:25.630
Are you all right?

01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:27.384
Yeah. Never better.

01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:48.745
Let me see your hands!

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:10.464
Reese! Take my hand!

01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:13.260
Hurry!

01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:37.187
Hands up!
Let me see your hands now!

01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:38.950
Get your hands up!

01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.869
Hands where we can see them!

01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:44.941
You can't wound them all
before they'd kill us.

01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:50.668
I'm 14 rounds short
of an acceptable success margin.

01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:52.709
Ugh, those odds suck. Stand down.

01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:57.304
Down on your knees.

01:30:58.260 --> 01:30:59.625
Let's go, get down.

01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:01.626
Get down!

01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:17.989
You can't hold us here.

01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:20.387
You had enough weapons
to invade the Sudan.

01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:22.668
We call that probable cause.

01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:25.031
What are these for?

01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:29.941
I use them to find my keys.

01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:31.664
No one likes a smart-ass, son.

01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:33.904
Didn't your mother teach you that?

01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:35.431
My mom was Irish,

01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:39.147
<i>so she encouraged
my smart-assed-ness.</i>

01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:41.664
I've never seen him before.

01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:44.747
How about you folks?
You know this man?

01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:46.186
No.

01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:49.027
He does look familiar.

01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:53.301
He kind of looks like you, Dad.

01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:55.269
<i>They're here, sir.</i>

01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:02.627
Okay, if you wouldn't mind
waiting in the conference room,

01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:04.060
I'll just be a couple of minutes.

01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:05.866
Thanks, Kyle.

01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:12.389
You don't talk much, do you?

01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:18.501
So who's Lurch?

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:19.701
No idea.

01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:21.780
We're not even sure he speaks English.

01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:25.182
Witnesses say you were fighting
with a man on the bridge.

01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:28.749
Agents. Listen to me.

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:30.863
- My name is O'Brien.
- No. Hell, no!

01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:33.301
Hey, I've been working
this case for 33 years.

01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:35.100
- What do you want, a medal?
- Hey!

01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:37.590
Sit down!

01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:40.020
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:41.426
Oh, shit.

01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:44.305
He's looking right at you.

01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:46.260
That's impossible.
He can't see through...

01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:49.221
Wait, wait, wait!

01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:07.180
Why are they always trying to kill you?

01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:10.181
I want to help you. I do. I think.

01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:12.103
But I gotta understand.

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:15.463
I know what's going on here
has to be really, really complicated.

01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:17.264
We're here to stop the end of the world.

01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:19.665
I can work with that.

01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:28.982
Kyle! Get back here!

01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:30.981
Sarah?

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:32.581
Get Reese.

01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:34.501
I'm right behind you.

01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:44.308
- Get in your car and go.
- Okay.

01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:50.950
Kyle! Kyle.

01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:56.989
Kyle. You can do this.

01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:00.145
A straight line.

01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:04.865
You just go, and you don't look back.

01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:08.541
Got it?

01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:27.188
Find him. Go!

01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:38.028
That's yours, too, I believe.

01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:43.184
Nice to see you.

01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:46.550
Pops. Load up.

01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:55.381
Liquefied magnetic shotgun shells.

01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:59.068
Magnetic Rifle Entry Munition.

01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:01.707
I read about this on gunsandammo.com.

01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:04.421
That's the new breacher.
Big blast, no shrapnel.

01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:06.708
Blows a door clean off.

01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:10.751
You know, for people
who can't do that themselves.

01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:12.271
Take it. Let's go.

01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:20.340
You can fly, right?

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:21.740
Yeah.

01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:23.905
John taught me.

01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:36.907
I'll tell them you took a car,
headed south.

01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:38.061
Thank you.

01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:42.301
Run away.

01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:49.421
Hang on!

01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:16.788
Which way is Cyberdyne?

01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:19.346
Head to the Bay Bridge, then southeast.

01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:43.546
You got to get him off me!

01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:21.707
Cyberdyne.

01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:23.948
The manufacturing
and research buildings

01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:25.545
are all below ground.

01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:28.101
He's gaining on us!

01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:29.824
All right, Sarah,
I need you to back him off,

01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:31.351
so I can get above him.

01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:34.031
Pops, when I do that,
can you take him out?

01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:35.666
I can.

01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:37.026
Okay, hold on!

01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:12.591
You got this?

01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:16.584
- I'll be back.
- What?

01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:54.390
Call in, call in!
Police, fire, everybody. Do it!

01:38:57.460 --> 01:39:00.543
Come on, come on.
Pick up the phone, damn it.

01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:03.547
Mr. Connor?

01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:06.351
Sorry, Doug, but I'm afraid
I can't have any witnesses.

01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:09.784
<i>Security Control.
State your password and emergency.</i>

01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:13.541
Security code
Zulu-Bravo-Foxtrot-0-0-2-8.

01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:15.825
False alarm.

01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:19.984
You have a nice night.

01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:34.425
He's okay.

01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:39.061
He may be at the bottom of the lake,

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:41.426
but he's okay.

01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:44.351
What about John?

01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:46.024
I think he's doing just fine.

01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:47.741
Do you see him?

01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:48.901
No.

01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:50.750
But you can bet he sees us.

01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:16.544
I know who you are.

01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:18.869
John told me.

01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:22.548
You want to destroy me.

01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:23.941
You're Skynet?

01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:26.031
I'm becoming Skynet.

01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:28.544
You're not a child.

01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:31.465
I know what you are,
and what you're going to do.

01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:35.947
What I'm going to do?
You came here to kill me.

01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:39.750
But you're too late.

01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:42.060
Ask him.

01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:45.821
That's all you people know how to do.

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:48.461
Kill what you don't understand.

01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:54.623
There aren't enough bullets
in the world to kill me.

01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:05.622
John Connor talks too much.

01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:10.586
Follow me.

01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:15.341
The timer, it sped up. Why?

01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:18.304
Skynet is evolving.
We no longer have hours.

01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:20.224
It will be able to upload much sooner.

01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:23.264
Each time it ages,
the clock speeds up. This way.

01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:24.427
Wait, you've been here before?

01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:27.504
I was able to infiltrate
the work crews in this facility.

01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:29.669
You got a job in construction?

01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:31.344
Until I was laid off.

01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:41.345
What the hell?

01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:43.900
John has a time machine?

01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:45.186
Not yet.

01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:47.991
Only the magnetic
quantum field is complete.

01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:10.591
At the rate the counter's going,
we'll never clear out in time.

01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:12.026
Then we blow it anyway.

01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:13.340
There is an alternative.

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:15.667
I was able to program
your voice and handprint

01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:17.868
into the biometric security system.

01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:19.823
There's a safe room on the lowest level

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:22.028
that we can access to survive the blast.

01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:28.147
What about that?
Is it dangerous?

01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:31.543
Polyalloy requires
programming to take permanent form.

01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:34.546
Without the CPU, it is harmless.

01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:45.061
How long?

01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:46.869
Skynet will upload in 11 minutes.

01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:50.585
We split up. Stay in contact.

01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:52.871
Let's move.

01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:11.231
Mankind pays lip service to peace.

01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:12.906
But it's a lie.

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:14.863
So your final solution is to kill us all?

01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:17.541
I don't think so.

01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:22.629
<i>The countdown jumped again.
We're down to eight minutes.</i>

01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:25.500
I won't allow this.

01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:27.708
And what are you gonna do,
talk us to death?

01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:28.981
You don't even have a body.

01:43:31.820 --> 01:43:33.663
And you only have one detonator.

01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:38.664
You can't win.

01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:43.026
I've got company!

01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:46.584
Give me the detonator!

01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:50.708
Do it, Pops! Do it now!

01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:02.746
I cannot.

01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:05.788
I cannot kill Sarah Connor.

01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:06.901
You have to!

01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:09.102
I order you!

01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:14.140
He can't.

01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:16.471
Neither can I.

01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:20.110
Because if you die,
he definitely hits that button.

01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:22.228
Sarah!

01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:03.266
Sarah!

01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:05.824
The detonator's destroyed.

01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:08.628
There's got to be another way. Come on.

01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:40.830
No, Pops! No, no, no!

01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:42.501
Pops, no!

01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:46.828
I understand how to control this place.

01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:48.990
I understand a lot of things now.

01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:52.184
You need to understand. You've lost.

01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:55.191
Not yet, we haven't. Come on!

01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:08.827
Shaped charge.

01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:11.060
Big enough to get us in,
small enough not to kill us.

01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:12.505
You have a plan, right?

01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:14.666
Theoretically.

01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:36.265
What was it you said?

01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:40.903
"I don't think so"?

01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:43.901
John!

01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:48.706
No.

01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:06.102
That's the thing that attacked John.

01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:09.583
I didn't attack John. I saved him.

01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:16.590
Primates evolve over millions of years.
I evolve in seconds.

01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:19.591
And I am here.

01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:27.950
In exactly four minutes,

01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:31.983
I will be everywhere.

01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:12.311
You are nothing but a relic
from a deleted timeline.

01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:23.700
This is pointless. I am inevitable.

01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:27.187
- Go!
- My existence is inevitable.

01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:30.267
Why can't you just accept it?

01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:31.910
Because we're human.

01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:04.506
You were never
strong enough to defeat me.

01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:09.071
Not alone.

01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:10.581
John?

01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:13.228
Stop. Now.

01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:17.782
When will you ever learn?

01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:23.306
Now, Sarah!

01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:56.262
Kyle Reese! Activate the field generator.

01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:58.621
No, Pops, not with you inside.
You know what will happen.

01:50:01.020 --> 01:50:03.751
Pops... Pops, please! Please, Pops!

01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:06.141
Skynet is almost free.

01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:11.309
I cannot hold John Connor much longer.

01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:18.302
Kyle Reese, protect my Sarah.

01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:20.504
No! No! No!

01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:23.625
No. Pops, no! No!

01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:31.308
Pops! No!

01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:39.989
- No!
- Sarah!

01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:42.670
It's the only way.

01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:44.861
Come on.

01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:22.948
<i>Scanning. Identify yourself.</i>

01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:24.181
Sarah Connor.

01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:54.511
We have to get out of here.
We have to find him.

01:52:54.620 --> 01:52:56.065
Sarah, he's gone.

01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:01.147
- He's...
- Dead? Yeah, I know that.

01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:04.463
I mean, we leave no part of him behind.
It's too dangerous.

01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:10.140
He loved you.

01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:18.510
Anyone who loves me,

01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:20.500
all of them,

01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:22.860
they die.

01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:27.867
Not all of them. Not this time.

01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:37.507
Hey.

01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:44.470
You need to understand
that Skynet's gone.

01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:47.220
You're free.

01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:53.384
For the first time,
you can choose the life you want.

01:53:55.140 --> 01:53:56.904
Any life you want.

01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:03.063
What if I don't know how?

01:54:08.980 --> 01:54:12.780
Well, since we're about to run out of air,

01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:15.790
I'd say you don't need to worry about it.

01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:30.591
Hello, Sarah Connor.

01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:32.420
Pops!

01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:36.865
I thought you were dead.

01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:39.591
No. Just upgraded.

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:41.910
What about John?

01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:46.263
His constituent parts
could not have survived the blast.

01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:50.261
That means there's
only one thing left to do.

01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:05.144
Easy, boy. What is it?

01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:13.540
Hey, Kyle.

01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:14.581
Hey. Um...

01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:16.780
What are you doing here?

01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:22.142
A friend of mine really
needs to talk to you, if that's okay.

01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:24.151
Yeah, I guess so.

01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:33.301
Thank you.

01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:50.340
I like her.

01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:55.151
Yeah, me, too.

01:55:57.100 --> 01:55:59.501
Now, this is going to sound
kind of strange,

01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:03.307
but there's something
I need you to remember.

01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:05.385
A message.

01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:06.871
Who do I tell?

01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:10.706
Yourself.

01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:13.544
Over and over.

01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:16.180
Are you ready?

01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:20.871
It goes like this.

01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:26.661
Remember Genisys is Skynet.

01:56:33.060 --> 01:56:35.347
Kyle Reese is a good man.

01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:42.906
He is.

01:56:50.140 --> 01:56:51.380
So what now?

01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:54.900
You were right.

01:56:57.980 --> 01:56:59.584
I can choose.

01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:22.422
You know that's really disturbing, right?

01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:27.590
You'll get used to it.

01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:42.911
<i>And it was over.</i>

01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:45.864
<i>Skynet was gone.</i>

01:57:47.060 --> 01:57:49.028
<i>And now one road has become many.</i>

01:57:50.260 --> 01:57:54.265
<i>Though questions remain,
we'll search for the answers together.</i>

01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:56.948
<i>But one thing we know for sure.</i>

01:57:58.020 --> 01:58:00.068
<i>The future is not set.</i>
