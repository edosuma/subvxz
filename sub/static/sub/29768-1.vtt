01:43.256 --> 01:46.968
Hello, beauty queens. Come gather here.

01:47.135 --> 01:52.056
I see their eyes. Do not be shy, I do not bite if you do not want it.

01:53.141 --> 01:57.437
I have the finest goods from the most remote places in the Roman Empire.

01:57.603 --> 02:02.483
Do you fish? From Germania. The grapes are from Gaul.

02:02.608 --> 02:04.736
How fresh they are, is a matter of taste.

02:04.902 --> 02:07.780
- We blow ¥ look at, Col. - You must ¥.

02:07.947 --> 02:12.493
- I can not. - Ã ?? Destroy not now ¥, okay?

02:13.161 --> 02:16.164
- We stick to the plan. - What are you talking about?

02:16.748 --> 02:21.210
- We're going to hurt the Romans where it feels. - We steal apples.

02:21.377 --> 02:25.298
- We disrupts their food supplies. - Exactly. Apples.

02:25.465 --> 02:32.263
It's not about apples, Julian. But ... what they represent.

02:32.430 --> 02:35.933
They symbolize decadence, oppressor bosom.

02:36.100 --> 02:39.395
One must ¥ start smÃ ¥ tt, Jules. How plunge to an empire?

02:39.562 --> 02:43.358
I know. Brick by brick.

02:48.988 --> 02:53.660
- Pardon. - Can I help you, honey?

02:54.202 --> 02:58.623
It can actually. Can you tell about your glorious grapes?

02:58.790 --> 03:04.212
The grapes? These grapes from Gallia is the best one can get ¥ hold of.

03:04.379 --> 03:07.715
- Odor. - Should I smell on ¥ them?

03:09.926 --> 03:13.137
- Very fine grapes. - I can not do it.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.141
A bit of a rebel you are. Roman scum is all you will get.

03:18.518 --> 03:20.645
View and lÃ|r.

03:34.409 --> 03:38.413
- wonder you just got my chest? - It is not something to ¥ grasp anyway.

03:39.414 --> 03:44.085
Stop, you little shit! I know your father. Move yourselves!

03:44.544 --> 03:48.381
- Move! It was your fault! - What are you selling really?

03:48.548 --> 03:50.591
I'll take you!

04:09.193 --> 04:11.571
You ruined nearly everything.

04:11.988 --> 04:16.242
I would not do it from the beginning. Dad would kill me if we were caught.

04:16.367 --> 04:20.038
You get ¥ r talk to him next time.

04:20.329 --> 04:22.623
I do it better than you.

04:27.879 --> 04:30.298
- Can I get ¥ apple mine? - deserve it.

04:30.840 --> 04:34.344
- Then I'll take it only. - Then beat ¥ r i you.

04:35.094 --> 04:38.389
- What was the point of that? - We plunge Empire.

04:41.893 --> 04:45.355
You know what they are doing with thieves, your selfish little pig?

04:47.398 --> 04:50.985
The whale of hÃ ¥ spirit at ¥ you. Then you are absolutely worthless to me.

04:54.072 --> 04:56.324
Dad!

05:00.036 --> 05:02.914
Take this weather so ¥ kind.

05:16.552 --> 05:18.596
Sit down.

05:43.746 --> 05:48.084
Col. You may want to keep a low profile for a while.

05:50.044 --> 05:54.590
- BlÃ ¥ say the revolt ... a while. - Are you serious?

05:57.093 --> 06:02.181
- Do you think he's right? - No, but I do not think you understand ¥ r.

06:03.891 --> 06:06.602
It is not only you who ...

06:08.980 --> 06:12.817
Listen for. You must ¥ be more careful.

06:13.318 --> 06:16.321
Final Ã ¥ be a so ¥ nn fucking wimp.

06:34.797 --> 06:38.176
What are you looking at ¥? Do you think you're better than us?

06:38.801 --> 06:42.013
- You should probably go ¥. - What will you do?

06:44.557 --> 06:47.226
- Go ¥ here, boys. - Protects them on ¥ seriously?

06:47.393 --> 06:49.479
What's your problem?

06:49.604 --> 06:52.607
- Make something then. - Colin.

06:53.733 --> 06:56.736
Colin! Forget it.

06:57.403 --> 06:59.781
Listen here, boys ...

07:18.341 --> 07:22.553
- Are you okay, Jules? - Yes that is OK.

07:23.179 --> 07:27.308
- One must ¥ ste ¥ up for themselves. - Hectic day, boys?

07:27.767 --> 07:29.978
And, grandpa.

07:30.144 --> 07:34.941
- FÃ|le fish in the river? - Yes, they fought really.

07:35.525 --> 07:37.902
Fiskelykke?

07:39.654 --> 07:43.700
Stay away from trÃ¸bbel. We'll see you at home.

07:58.423 --> 08:01.092
What happened to your face? It is sÃ¸nderslÃ ¥ tt!

08:01.259 --> 08:05.471
There are those boys again. They have bad ¥ excellent influence on ¥ her.

08:05.638 --> 08:08.266
This conversation again? Can we just blow ¥ see in it?

08:08.891 --> 08:11.019
- You have ... - There is no danger.

08:11.227 --> 08:15.732
Yes, that's it. Which man with self-respect would marry you?

08:15.898 --> 08:19.402
- I do not know. Who did you have in mind? - Disgusting.

08:19.569 --> 08:22.363
- Thanks. - Your sister would never come home so ¥ nn.

08:22.488 --> 08:24.949
And look at ¥ her when ¥.

08:25.116 --> 08:28.745
- She married into a respectable family. - It cost a lot, but ...

08:28.911 --> 08:32.206
Cathy is a bitch, Mom. She is a bad ¥ excellent person.

08:32.373 --> 08:36.169
And you follows in her tracks. Now ¥ r you should give us a grandchild?

08:36.669 --> 08:39.922
What keeps you at ¥ with? We are not Romans.

08:40.048 --> 08:43.509
- And it tries we Ã ¥ be. - All Taveta about Ã ¥ be respected.

08:43.676 --> 08:46.429
- Think about ¥ language ¥ consumption. - That's just crap.

08:48.222 --> 08:51.726
I get ¥ tt enough of this.

10:39.959 --> 10:43.171
I'm so ¥ tired of this place. It's a haul.

10:43.755 --> 10:46.924
My parents do not stop Ã ¥ talk about giftermÃ ¥ l.

10:51.262 --> 10:55.391
I'm going to leave here so ¥ fast as I can.

10:55.767 --> 10:57.810
So ¥ it say?

10:57.977 --> 11:00.688
- Where do you go? - Stop me to revolt.

11:00.855 --> 11:05.318
- SÃ ¥ you will kill some Romans? - Exactly. I'll take me to Rome ...

11:05.443 --> 11:11.366
... and find that idiot Augustus and fix him. You should join.

11:11.741 --> 11:16.746
- There are enough people here. - And it has come more recently.

11:18.289 --> 11:23.920
- It certainly was a massacre nordpÃ ¥. - Dad said it was nonsense.

11:24.587 --> 11:26.839
Only people who are spreading rumors.

11:29.217 --> 11:32.428
So ¥, who joins to Rome?

11:33.930 --> 11:38.142
- I can actually imagine it. - I have too much to ¥ do.

11:39.602 --> 11:41.854
What did your parents say?

11:42.647 --> 11:46.609
- That I shall promptly ¥ s so ¥ much with you. - With me?

11:46.776 --> 11:49.404
You are not exactly husband material.

11:49.529 --> 11:52.532
- Do they have Matt me? - Apparently.

11:53.741 --> 11:57.996
- They'll miss me when ¥ r I'm gone. - VÃ ¥ re life exists here, Col.

11:58.162 --> 12:01.916
- Not mine. Nothing keeps me here. - SkÃ ¥ l it.

12:03.876 --> 12:05.920
You know what I mean.

12:13.011 --> 12:16.180
Damn also ¥! Fort, we stick!

12:16.347 --> 12:18.766
Hurry dere!

12:19.350 --> 12:24.647
Stop! Which one of you threw it?

12:26.232 --> 12:28.443
What makes you here?

12:29.694 --> 12:33.781
- What the hell did you do there? - What are you gonna do with it?

12:33.948 --> 12:35.616
Colin, shut up. We are sorry.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.577
Not me. He should not even be here.

12:37.744 --> 12:40.663
- What did you say? - Be careful with that one.

12:40.830 --> 12:42.957
Do not tell me what to do, boy.

12:43.124 --> 12:46.919
- SÃ ¥ you think you're tough? - Hold up, you do it worse.

12:47.462 --> 12:50.173
- We do not want abrupt ¥ k. - Or maybe I will.

12:50.340 --> 12:54.344
- Shut up. - Can not we just quit, weather so ¥ kind?

12:56.512 --> 13:00.975
I know who you are. You are Dases uekting.

13:02.060 --> 13:06.064
- Let him be in peace. - He probably would not like this.

13:06.648 --> 13:10.401
I do not think he'd been so ¥ happy if he knew that you have left your post.

13:10.526 --> 13:13.613
Or that you're a big dirt, but he knows enough everything.

13:13.780 --> 13:18.201
Be careful with your words, boy.

13:18.326 --> 13:21.454
- SÃ ¥ you are a tÃ¸ffing? - Colin, finally.

13:23.873 --> 13:25.875
Is there hora di?

13:27.669 --> 13:29.712
Do not call her that.

13:36.219 --> 13:39.305
- Okay, SATA. - No, weather so ¥ kind ...

13:39.806 --> 13:42.225
I no one's whore.

13:42.642 --> 13:45.228
Why we change not at ¥ it?

13:45.853 --> 13:48.648
I pretend this never happened.

13:49.857 --> 13:54.487
No need Ã ¥ get ¥ know anything. You can also get ¥ ¥ taste when ¥ r I'm ready.

13:56.698 --> 13:59.659
- Let me see his feet your. - What?

13:59.826 --> 14:03.913
Take off your stÃ¸vlene your.

14:07.709 --> 14:10.003
I'm gonna have fun with you.

14:13.423 --> 14:17.468
- What the hell did you do that for? - Are you all right?

14:17.635 --> 14:20.972
- Yes that is OK. - Are you okay, buddy?

14:23.516 --> 14:25.685
Cameras?

14:26.269 --> 14:30.356
- Are you okay? - Damn, he's dead!

14:30.523 --> 14:34.319
- Are you sure? He can not be. - Col, what have you done?

14:34.444 --> 14:38.656
Why did you do it? You need not have Ã ¥ kill him.

14:39.615 --> 14:43.202
- I must ¥ home. - Home? We must ¥ out of here.

14:43.369 --> 14:46.080
- What are you talking about? - They are going to ¥ kill us.

14:46.205 --> 14:49.751
- Dad can help us. - No one can help us.

14:49.917 --> 14:54.547
We go ¥ r back at first and then ... Hold up, it's not my fault.

14:54.714 --> 14:58.843
Okay, we go ¥ r back and pulls so ¥ lot of things we can and go from here directly.

14:59.010 --> 15:03.097
- Exactly, we must ¥ go. - No, I can not go.

15:05.058 --> 15:08.811
- Where shall we go? - I do not know. Away from here.

15:10.229 --> 15:12.940
Ok, help me.

16:06.369 --> 16:08.955
- Want to buy a chicken for me? - No, it's good.

16:09.122 --> 16:13.751
- buy one of my chickens. Come on. - Go to hell!

16:27.265 --> 16:29.517
Let's go.

16:30.059 --> 16:32.353
Where are others?

16:36.941 --> 16:40.403
- What's that? - Pappas sword. He gets mad.

16:40.570 --> 16:44.532
No, it's probably fine. Where the hell is Anika?

16:44.949 --> 16:47.744
- Ok. - Then we draw.

17:20.233 --> 17:22.612
Maybe we should keep ourselves away from the roads.

17:23.404 --> 17:25.573
Just in case.

17:48.221 --> 17:51.224
Does anyone know where we are at ¥ way?

17:51.683 --> 17:53.977
We must ¥ find on ¥ a plan.

17:54.477 --> 17:58.147
We get ¥ r drag around on ¥ countryside and rob and then ¥ nt.

17:58.314 --> 18:04.612
What's wrong with you? We killed just a few. This is serious.

18:04.779 --> 18:06.906
Final Ã ¥ tulle.

18:25.591 --> 18:29.804
- Do you think we can ever go back? - I do not care.

18:34.851 --> 18:38.521
Maybe they did not know it was us.

18:39.063 --> 18:41.190
No, perhaps not.

19:08.051 --> 19:10.178
We stay overnight here.

19:11.387 --> 19:13.556
And...

19:14.432 --> 19:17.518
We should create both ¥ l, I freeze.

19:18.311 --> 19:22.565
- Not tonight. It's too dangerous. - Dangerous?

19:23.191 --> 19:25.360
People can look after us.

19:59.686 --> 20:02.605
- What is it? - What?

20:03.356 --> 20:09.237
- At ¥ my back. Do you have an erection? - What? What are you talking about?

20:09.404 --> 20:13.032
I also ¥ it. Do not let me if you show me yours.

20:21.749 --> 20:26.963
Why do not you go ¥ somewhere else and pee? Anywhere except here.

20:28.298 --> 20:30.758
So ¥ disgusting.

20:37.807 --> 20:41.519
Ã ?? lreit. Who is poised to ¥ find a new home?

20:41.853 --> 20:45.148
Yes, drit in it. Why not?

21:07.045 --> 21:10.089
Folks. Come and look at ¥ this.

21:17.764 --> 21:20.016
This is to ¥ lreit.

21:59.180 --> 22:01.641
Thanks.

22:07.146 --> 22:10.566
- Well? - It was indeed.

22:13.152 --> 22:17.490
This is the last food we have, so ¥ set price at ¥ it.

22:19.367 --> 22:22.704
- I'm glad you're here, everyone. - Yes.

22:23.371 --> 22:27.875
- We had no choice. - No but...

22:28.293 --> 22:35.633
... now ¥ we can do something. What we want to. Living off the land without responsibility.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.177
No jÃ|vla Romans.

22:38.886 --> 22:40.972
Only we, together.

22:41.889 --> 22:44.392
You mean we're going to be here?

22:45.059 --> 22:47.061
Too good?

22:48.062 --> 22:54.902
Yes, I mean. It takes a little work, but we can get ¥ a good life here.

23:48.665 --> 23:51.960
- Do you remember the swing? - Yes.

23:52.543 --> 23:55.880
- With a huge drop down. - And I had no fucking clue.

23:56.881 --> 24:01.219
- You fell and hurt your leg. - Yes, because you left me just there.

24:03.179 --> 24:06.015
No, not you. You were.

24:06.474 --> 24:08.601
But you're stuck.

24:09.060 --> 24:12.146
- It was lumpent. - We should fix food.

24:12.313 --> 24:17.235
- It took a long time. - But it was funny.

24:17.402 --> 24:20.321
- You did not you at all. - Yes, we did.

24:23.908 --> 24:26.285
It has grown again when ¥.

24:44.887 --> 24:49.434
- What the hell was that? - A paringsrop. I want to attract one.

24:49.600 --> 24:53.563
- SÃ ¥ you can fuck it. - There's nothing better to ¥ fuck here.

24:54.355 --> 24:57.066
Okay. Tell how it goes ¥ r.

24:59.235 --> 25:03.323
- Ã ?? lreit. You get ¥ r find food. - I got it.

25:04.282 --> 25:09.078
- Looks good. What is it? - A throwing stick.

25:10.288 --> 25:15.084
It does ends thicker than the middle.

25:15.209 --> 25:19.464
So ¥ now ¥ r throwing it, it flies out of place.

25:19.964 --> 25:24.093
And get ¥ ra Roman one in the head, dies he said.

25:25.345 --> 25:27.597
But it looks like dirt, what?

25:28.848 --> 25:31.100
Slightly.

25:41.653 --> 25:44.072
That's fine.

25:51.621 --> 25:56.459
I hunted with my boyfriend here before.

26:02.382 --> 26:06.552
- I'm good at Ã ¥ track. - Jasa ¥?

26:10.974 --> 26:14.018
- SÃ ¥ What do you do when ¥? - Waiting.

26:17.021 --> 26:19.273
Yep.

26:29.200 --> 26:31.869
Here we have it.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.664
If you drive us?

26:51.848 --> 26:55.101
- Do you think that we did the right thing? - What?

26:55.727 --> 26:58.187
That we went.

26:59.188 --> 27:03.609
Yes, I mean ... We did not exactly have a choice.

27:05.737 --> 27:07.989
I would think that it's true.

27:09.657 --> 27:12.827
- Are you okay? - Yes that is OK.

27:13.953 --> 27:16.122
I'm just famished.

27:32.805 --> 27:35.016
Cursed rats.

27:38.227 --> 27:40.480
Everything good, guys?

27:48.154 --> 27:52.992
So ¥ ... while chasing rats, provided I have a gift.

27:53.493 --> 27:56.913
Cheeky jÃ|vel. What is it about?

28:01.042 --> 28:04.379
- lever. - What is it about?

28:04.545 --> 28:07.423
Druids use them for Ã ¥ talk with the gods.

28:07.590 --> 28:10.635
- Col, we've barely eaten. - How?

28:11.219 --> 28:15.306
I do not know, but we'll figure it out.

28:15.723 --> 28:19.477
- I have a few questions ¥ l I want quiet. - Then perhaps we should do it.

28:19.644 --> 28:22.480
It is not for us. It is not meant that we should talk to them.

28:22.605 --> 28:26.025
Why not? What makes Druids so ¥ special?

28:26.192 --> 28:28.319
This is madness.

28:32.615 --> 28:36.995
Ã ?? lreit. So ¥ what do we do?

28:37.161 --> 28:42.667
Ok, I'm not quite sure, but I Antar to ...

29:16.909 --> 29:19.829
So ¥ now ¥ r we hear from the gods?

29:20.663 --> 29:26.419
I do not know, but you talk to them, so ¥ put in a good word for me.

29:49.859 --> 29:52.028
I do not know...

30:20.473 --> 30:22.600
I want you.

30:28.648 --> 30:30.858
I have come here himself.

31:52.649 --> 31:55.860
- What happened? - Lever you?

31:56.361 --> 32:00.490
- No. - You began to ¥ chop at ¥ tree there.

32:05.870 --> 32:08.623
I could not stop you. You could have destroy the house.

32:08.790 --> 32:14.212
- And Anika slept there. - But nothing happened and she is ok.

32:14.379 --> 32:17.715
- Are not you? - That's not the point.

32:18.341 --> 32:20.551
- Take the fun. - Take it fun?

32:20.718 --> 32:24.764
- Yes, it is quiet. - No, Colin. We do not have anything Ã ¥ eat.

32:24.889 --> 32:28.393
- No luck in hunting? - No nothing.

32:28.559 --> 32:32.021
- You must ¥ take this seriously. - What have we kept on ¥ with?

32:32.188 --> 32:35.984
- You have just kÃ¸ddet constantly. - It is unfair.

32:36.609 --> 32:38.736
And what have you done?

32:50.164 --> 32:52.333
- It was not fair. - Go to hell.

33:14.731 --> 33:17.066
SÃ ¥ ...

33:17.233 --> 33:19.610
Yesterday ¥ s evening.

33:22.447 --> 33:24.782
You know.

33:25.658 --> 33:30.246
- Continue. - You and I.

33:30.663 --> 33:33.958
- Let's get ¥ it to Ã ¥ happen. - What?

33:34.917 --> 33:38.713
Come on, do not play. I know you want it.

34:14.123 --> 34:16.292
It'll be fine.

35:28.740 --> 35:31.701
And since, turn the saw ¥ nn.

35:31.868 --> 35:36.831
And put it over these two.

35:37.206 --> 35:42.879
Twist. No, you do one at a time. You must ¥ do it in pairs.

35:43.004 --> 35:48.676
No, now ¥ ached too much. And since you keep so ¥ nn.

35:48.968 --> 35:50.970
And again.

35:51.137 --> 35:55.350
- I did not do it. - No, you did only one side.

35:56.309 --> 36:02.273
You turn so ¥ nn. No, together.

36:06.027 --> 36:11.532
We have been passive for too long. We must ¥ do something.

36:11.699 --> 36:13.910
I like to ¥ be here.

36:15.703 --> 36:20.333
- You know the other day when we took the mushrooms. - Yes?

36:22.335 --> 36:25.546
I believe that the gods told me to fuck Anika.

36:26.214 --> 36:28.341
What?

36:29.384 --> 36:32.303
I can not quite explain, but ...

36:32.470 --> 36:38.351
- ... she was weird and I just felt it. - I do not know.

36:39.352 --> 36:44.524
- It can make things more complicated. - Yes maybe.

36:49.946 --> 36:54.659
Do you think that she ... you know. Hell!

37:06.671 --> 37:10.383
- They'll be looking for us. - It was an army.

37:10.550 --> 37:13.386
It had been sick if they so ¥ after us.

37:13.469 --> 37:15.680
But we must ¥ be more cautious.

37:16.389 --> 37:21.227
- Why do you think they have come? - It must have happened ¥ something serious.

37:22.186 --> 37:26.899
- Now ¥ we have the chance to Ã ¥ do something. - Do not be silly.

37:27.066 --> 37:30.069
Are you going to kill all of them with a stick?

37:30.236 --> 37:34.532
- We have been passive for too long. - It just means more problems.

37:34.699 --> 37:36.868
Let it be.

37:41.372 --> 37:44.334
Okay. When am I doing it alone.

38:15.114 --> 38:18.701
- I worry about Colin. - he'll be fine.

38:18.868 --> 38:23.414
He is not stupid in the head, Anika. We must ¥ be more cautious.

38:23.581 --> 38:27.961
- He'll find out otherwise. - He has not been trying out on ¥ me yet ¥.

38:28.753 --> 38:31.464
But he said something scary the other day.

38:31.547 --> 38:32.548
What?

38:33.466 --> 38:36.135
- Do not think on ¥ it. - IM serious.

38:36.302 --> 38:38.554
It does not matter.

38:44.477 --> 38:46.562
Jules?

38:52.235 --> 38:54.362
Are you okay?

38:56.364 --> 38:58.491
Yes, there is no danger.

39:01.160 --> 39:04.372
- It's just a little tiring. - Jasa ¥?

39:34.235 --> 39:36.487
Get up, boy.

39:37.405 --> 39:39.699
I'll take this.

39:40.825 --> 39:44.454
- It's a boy from my village. - We should take him to camp.

39:44.620 --> 39:48.499
You can go back. I come afterwards ¥. This is mine.

40:10.438 --> 40:13.775
- What the hell do you do here? - What the hell do you do here?

40:13.941 --> 40:18.446
- Do not be so abrupt ¥ ¥ handsome boy. - You do not say to me what I should do.

40:19.989 --> 40:23.910
- Where is my Sannen? - Julian's ok.

40:25.203 --> 40:30.416
You idiot. You know what you've done?

40:31.584 --> 40:36.464
When you killed the soldier, come to your people as Ã ¥ punished.

40:39.258 --> 40:44.305
They did rebellion. And now ¥ must ¥ we stop it.

40:45.431 --> 40:51.145
You would not even have been here from the beginning. This is not your country.

40:51.312 --> 40:55.942
Do you think that I would get hit?

40:56.109 --> 41:00.321
I came here because I was ordered.

41:05.284 --> 41:07.370
Empire ...

41:08.830 --> 41:13.584
... will see you dead. All four.

41:14.585 --> 41:17.255
For a ¥ make the eksempel.

41:18.506 --> 41:21.175
How do they know it was us?

41:22.969 --> 41:26.723
Because you etched their names in WATCHTOWER ¥ rnet.

41:29.767 --> 41:35.064
Now ¥ retrieve the other and out of here.

41:37.025 --> 41:40.945
Thanks to my son, get ¥ r you a chance.

41:42.739 --> 41:44.866
Ta den.

41:58.296 --> 42:03.468
Folks! It has begun. The revolt.

42:03.635 --> 42:08.556
- What? Why? - The village of our ¥ r fighting back.

42:09.057 --> 42:12.185
- Why you smile? - It has begun.

42:12.727 --> 42:16.731
What the hell is wrong with you? You have started a war.

42:16.898 --> 42:22.153
- What do you mean? We were there all along. - But we did not kill Roman.

42:22.320 --> 42:25.239
So ¥ you should just let him ...

42:25.698 --> 42:28.868
- statt me. - If you had kept quiet ...

42:31.579 --> 42:35.416
- It is not true. - We may never return home now ¥.

42:35.583 --> 42:38.586
We have everything we need here. Was not that the point?

42:38.753 --> 42:41.130
But it is no matter your fault.

43:19.877 --> 43:21.879
Is everything OK?

43:31.389 --> 43:33.599
Do not be one so ¥ nn pussy.

43:38.313 --> 43:41.524
What is this? What do you do?

43:42.734 --> 43:44.944
You Omga ¥ s.

43:49.282 --> 43:52.285
- I'll take care only of you. - Taking advantage of me?

43:52.744 --> 43:56.331
- That's nonsense. - Yes, it makes me.

43:56.748 --> 43:59.709
- It's not necessary. - What?

44:00.084 --> 44:04.547
- Just go to hell. - No, please do. It is not child's play.

44:04.714 --> 44:08.718
- I can not take responsibility for you. - Yes, and now ¥ r have you done it?

44:09.761 --> 44:15.266
VÃ ¥ g not ... Dad never beat you as hard as me. I took 100 strokes for you-

44:15.433 --> 44:19.354
- so ¥ not ask me to go to hell. I had a life there.

44:19.520 --> 44:23.483
Will not you do something? Fight back, for I will.

44:23.650 --> 44:29.238
What's the point? It makes no difference. It just gets worse.

44:31.449 --> 44:35.662
Listen here, Col. I'm sorry.

44:35.828 --> 44:39.082
But I will not be part of the planning.

45:14.492 --> 45:17.578
- You have deceived us. - No way.

45:18.871 --> 45:21.791
What do you think the parents our ¥ re doing right now ¥?

45:23.167 --> 45:26.754
They tries surely still Ã ¥ find a man to me.

45:36.681 --> 45:40.059
You should try it. Ã ?? find yourself a man.

45:44.022 --> 45:46.649
With revens paringsrop.

45:48.526 --> 45:50.695
Relax.

46:13.468 --> 46:15.553
Is everything OK?

46:20.183 --> 46:25.021
- They've been gone a long time. - Yes. They were gone when I wake ¥ woke.

46:50.922 --> 46:53.049
Ok...

47:25.999 --> 47:28.042
What?

50:34.187 --> 50:36.522
Colin, is everything okay?

50:42.195 --> 50:46.783
- Col. - I'm leaving. I'm going to make a difference.

50:47.367 --> 50:50.953
- What are you talking about? Where are you going? - You do not want me here, so ¥ I leave.

50:51.120 --> 50:53.122
- What the hell are you talking about? - What is it, Col.?

50:53.247 --> 50:55.875
Speak not dirt! I will not hear at ¥ you!

50:56.042 --> 50:59.712
- Do not tell me. - What is it with you?

50:59.879 --> 51:02.674
- Did you not know that I would not notice it? - What you talking about?

51:02.840 --> 51:06.803
You said that I should not do something because then it becomes complicated.

51:06.970 --> 51:11.265
- I heard you the other night. - We would not tell, okay?

51:11.432 --> 51:13.643
- We knew you would ... - Do not lie to me!

51:13.768 --> 51:16.562
I'm not lying! You are my best friend.

51:17.605 --> 51:21.067
- You were with because we felt sorry for ¥ you. - Colin, hold up.

51:21.234 --> 51:25.613
- Your little uekting. You are pathetic. - Colin.

51:35.456 --> 51:37.500
Are you okay?

51:39.335 --> 51:41.462

51:44.424 --> 51:46.718
I think that I'm pregnant.

53:51.050 --> 53:55.388
Sorry I fled. I panicked.

53:56.764 --> 53:58.891
Idiot.

54:00.518 --> 54:02.854
How long have you known?

54:04.188 --> 54:06.316

When sÃ¸steren I was pregnant, it was like.

54:14.073 --> 54:16.826
I'm not ready for this.

54:16.993 --> 54:21.122
- I will not be like her sister min. - That you're not going Ã ¥ be.

54:21.289 --> 54:24.292

54:27.337 --> 54:34.886
We take care of it together. We can go to a nice place and ...

54:36.638 --> 54:39.223
You shall be my dad, Jules.

55:35.488 --> 55:37.699

- What you did ... You started something. - But that's just me now ¥.

55:48.918 --> 55:51.087
When you had gone ...

55:51.671 --> 55:55.425

55:55.591 --> 55:59.304

56:01.055 --> 56:04.475
- Where are my parents? - SÃ ¥ you them?

56:12.025 --> 56:17.113
The soldiers would fetch your friend Aniikas family. Your father Pravda Ã ¥ stop them.

56:20.992 --> 56:26.748
Your mama ... I am unsure on ¥. She disappeared.

56:26.998 --> 56:29.083

56:29.792 --> 56:33.963
- I do not know, I swear. - Where is she?

56:34.589 --> 56:38.801
You must ¥ calm down. They are looking for you ... and your friends.

56:39.552 --> 56:42.180
I commit myself. Then maybe they let them be.

56:42.347 --> 56:46.601
Do not be silly. It is too late. Do not know what you are?

56:46.726 --> 56:50.146
I do not care about that shit. I just...

56:50.647 --> 56:55.193

59:38.022 --> 59:43.403
I'm looking for a guy. He came here. Who else is here?

- I should never have left you. - Excuse me.

01:01:11.866 --> 01:01:14.077
I will not leave you.

01:01:15.536 --> 01:01:19.874
- I'll stay here and take care of you. - I know.

01:01:46.067 --> 01:01:49.779
Col, I'm sorry, but we must go ¥ ¥ ¥ now.

01:01:50.363 --> 01:01:54.575
- He said it himself. - I can not just leave him.

01:01:54.742 --> 01:01:57.328
We can not take him with us.

01:01:59.247 --> 01:02:03.042
- What shall we do with him? - What about more popping up?

01:02:06.963 --> 01:02:09.257

01:04:47.749 --> 01:04:52.670
I watched ¥ them a few days ago. He and some other soldiers.

01:04:55.423 --> 01:05:00.511
He spoke with me and saved me. So ¥ he disappeared.

01:05:00.678 --> 01:05:04.724

01:05:04.891 --> 01:05:07.977

01:15:17.211 --> 01:15:21.716
I'm sorry. I should not have gone.

01:15:21.883 --> 01:15:25.845
- It's not your fault. - Yes, that's it. Everything.

01:15:26.471 --> 01:15:29.474
- No, we are all implicated. - But it should not you be.

01:15:30.266 --> 01:15:33.311
If I just kept his mouth, had none of this happened.

01:15:33.478 --> 01:15:37.815
- All those which died at ¥ because of me. - Do not be silly.

01:15:38.816 --> 01:15:42.862
- It had happened anyway. - Final Ã ¥ protect me.

01:15:45.865 --> 01:15:48.368
I must ¥ do something about it.

01:15:50.286 --> 01:15:54.749
- What should you do? - I lead them away or something.

01:15:54.916 --> 01:15:58.419
- You must ¥ here. - It is unfair Ã ¥ only ask us to leave.

01:15:58.586 --> 01:16:00.755
It's not about what's fair.

01:16:01.506 --> 01:16:03.675
That's my problem.

01:16:06.552 --> 01:16:10.556
Be so ¥ kind ... We will not abandon you.

01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:17.522
They do not come to Ã ¥ stop. Do not play otherwise.

01:16:18.606 --> 01:16:23.611
- No one else will die at ¥ because of me. - be so ¥ kind, you need not do so.

01:16:23.778 --> 01:16:26.406
Just join us.

01:16:36.833 --> 01:16:39.961
Go ¥ now ¥. I find you.

01:20:21.557 --> 01:20:27.230
You are a taff jÃ|vel. It innrÃ¸mmer I. It waited I do not.

01:20:30.066 --> 01:20:32.402
You killed two Roman soldiers.

01:20:35.071 --> 01:20:38.574
- Imposing a boy. - I'm not a kid.

01:20:43.121 --> 01:20:45.206
Men not running.

01:20:48.293 --> 01:20:51.087
Sin. You had been a good soldier.

01:23:26.242 --> 01:23:31.177
