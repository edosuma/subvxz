00:04.700 --> 00:07.877
So many careers to choose from!

00:07.920 --> 00:10.010
I'm most excited
about the scientist.

00:10.053 --> 00:13.796
Scientists are truly working
on the front lines of discovery.

00:13.839 --> 00:16.494
Working on the front lines
of discovery...

00:16.538 --> 00:18.366
is not what I do.

00:18.409 --> 00:20.759
All the good stuff... that's
all done by computers now.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.152
Oh.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.589
I see lots of cute animals
every day.

00:24.633 --> 00:27.549
And I put almost all of them
to sleep.

00:27.592 --> 00:28.985
No matter how much I shower,

00:29.029 --> 00:31.292
I smell like I'm wearing
a flea collar.

00:31.335 --> 00:34.382
I got into being a cowboy
because it was manly.

00:34.425 --> 00:37.080
But, ironically, the harsh
bumping of the saddle

00:37.124 --> 00:39.778
has destroyed my dick and balls.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.998
I'm so tired of candy.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.001
Sometimes late at night,
I go to the kitchen

00:45.045 --> 00:47.743
and I eat spoonfuls of salt.

00:47.786 --> 00:50.093
I don't love my wife anymore.

00:50.137 --> 00:53.096
Because of the candy?

00:53.140 --> 00:54.793
Yes.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.360
A real astronaut!

00:56.404 --> 00:59.842
Okay, so, I'm not an astronaut.

00:59.885 --> 01:04.238
- Oh!
- I'm a radio engineer.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.892
That's right... radio.

01:06.936 --> 01:09.069
Does anyone here
listen to radio?

01:10.766 --> 01:13.377
Free radios, kids!
Give it a try!

01:13.421 --> 01:15.075
It's like podcasts,

01:15.118 --> 01:18.121
but it works around our
schedule, not yours.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.994
My show is
the morning-drive time,

01:22.038 --> 01:26.216
every day on WLNG 98.2.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.392

02:38.419 --> 02:41.465
But... but you're not
a circus manager.

02:41.509 --> 02:44.512
It's a long process.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.203
So you're my trainee,

05:34.246 --> 05:36.553
here to learn how to drive
the famous BangVan?

05:36.597 --> 05:38.468
Yeah.
I mean, I'm hoping

05:38.512 --> 05:39.837
to get in the back seat
at some point,

05:39.861 --> 05:41.166
do some acting, you know?

05:41.210 --> 05:42.385
Get in line.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.213
I've been the driver forever,

05:44.256 --> 05:46.563
so if anybody's getting that tap
on the shoulder, it's me.

05:46.607 --> 05:48.086
Beautiful street, right?

05:48.130 --> 05:50.045
It's not just the humping
people enjoy.

05:50.088 --> 05:52.090
It's the scenery
going by the windows.

05:52.134 --> 05:53.396
It's a huge part, I believe.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.876
- Shhhh!
- Shh!

05:54.919 --> 05:56.399
Just because you work
in a BangVan

05:56.443 --> 05:58.270
doesn't mean
you can't be professional.

05:58.314 --> 06:00.795

eyes on the road.

06:00.838 --> 06:02.729

06:04.451 --> 06:07.018
Oh, damn, that's hot!

06:07.062 --> 06:09.934
Wow. Guys,
I ran a red just then.

06:13.329 --> 06:15.375
Is this meth, Steve?

06:15.418 --> 06:19.727
It's my rose quartz...
to relax my neural pathways.

06:19.770 --> 06:22.051
I've been listening to this
radio show hosted by Palmer...

06:22.077 --> 06:25.994
Radio is dead, Steve.
Stern is on SiriusXM now.

06:26.037 --> 06:27.561
Astral projection?

06:27.604 --> 06:30.041
Oh, Steve,
that's New Age garbage.

06:30.085 --> 06:33.262
And a book? When TV?
What are you thinking?

06:33.305 --> 06:35.786
Palmer says everyone used
to astral-project,

06:35.830 --> 06:38.485
until our pineal glands
got gunked up with fluoride...

06:38.528 --> 06:40.225
The pineal gland is a myth!

06:40.269 --> 06:43.403
Well, no one disputes
the pineal gland exists.

06:43.446 --> 06:44.902
People just aren't sure
what the gland does.

06:44.926 --> 06:47.624
Gland this, gland that.
Let's not talk about glands.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.191
Let's talk about careers.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.149
You could be anything, Steve.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.518
Why, you could be
an endocrinologist,

06:52.542 --> 06:53.630
whatever that is.

06:53.674 --> 06:55.327
That's... Are you...

06:55.371 --> 06:57.112
That's a doctor
who studies glands.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.505
There's that word again.

06:58.548 --> 07:00.332
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to forbid you

07:00.376 --> 07:02.117

to that radio show.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.684

I know who has

07:03.727 --> 07:05.468
any wonder in his life!

07:05.512 --> 07:07.252
Pff! You don't need
astral projection

07:07.296 --> 07:08.819
to have wonder in your life.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.691
Okay. Then where do I find it?

07:10.734 --> 07:14.085
Um, um, look, you know
I know the answer,

07:14.129 --> 07:16.740
but, uh, I'm tired,
you're tired,

07:16.784 --> 07:18.283

to be up all night explaining

07:18.307 --> 07:19.830
it to you when you're
not gonna get it.

Revenge of the Nerds</i> in here.

09:34.617 --> 09:37.359
Let's start from the begi...
He's gone.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.274
Initiate Expert Tracker mode.

09:40.884 --> 09:43.321
This open window is the perfect
place to stand

09:43.365 --> 09:45.149
and wonder how he got out.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.542
We've got to get there fast!

09:46.586 --> 09:48.283
Let's cut through the cemetery!

09:51.503 --> 09:54.028
I say we cross the playground
where we saw that condom,

09:54.071 --> 09:55.725
then shoot down Mohawk Drive.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.553
Mohawk... perfect!

09:57.597 --> 09:59.424
The tree roots pushed up
all the sidewalks,

09:59.468 --> 10:01.339
turning them into little ramps.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.776
Since time is of the essence,

10:02.819 --> 10:04.168
we'll only take five minutes

10:04.212 --> 10:05.406
to do totally sick bike jumps.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.606
- 10.
- Deal!

10:06.649 --> 10:08.695
- 15!
- Even better deal!

10:08.738 --> 10:11.436
Whoa! That guy almost hit me!

10:11.480 --> 10:13.177
I mean, I know it's my ticket.

10:13.221 --> 10:16.006
It's just... boy, you know,
I don't make much,

10:16.050 --> 10:18.443
and this big number here...
that's got me sweating.

10:18.487 --> 10:20.315
What does everybody
in the back think?

10:20.358 --> 10:21.509
It... it should be me
that pays it

10:21.533 --> 10:22.598
'cause I'm the one
that ran the red?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.101
Quiet, Teddy!

10:24.145 --> 10:25.842
Hey, new guy,
you ready to jump back here,

10:25.886 --> 10:26.713
show us your stuff?

10:26.756 --> 10:28.149
Yes, sir!

10:28.192 --> 10:30.020
Ooh!

10:30.064 --> 10:31.631
Are you kidding me?
I quit!

10:31.674 --> 10:33.154
Good luck getting people

10:33.197 --> 10:34.851
to watch sex in a parked van.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.508
I'm unquitting because
this just proves

10:39.551 --> 10:42.163
someone from up here can
actually make it back there.

10:42.206 --> 10:43.730
Shut up, Teddy!

10:46.080 --> 10:48.125
The radio station.

10:48.169 --> 10:50.519
Palmer's home address
has to be in there.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.564
We've just got to get
past the guard.

10:52.608 --> 10:55.655
Let's forget this
radio-station business

10:55.698 --> 10:58.832
and get a little high?

10:58.875 --> 11:01.138
Get high! That's it!

11:01.182 --> 11:03.706
There's a door up on the roof
of the radio station.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.490
We just need to build
a big-enough jump.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.231
A jump, you say?

11:12.062 --> 11:14.369
- Here goes noth...
- What do we have here?

11:14.412 --> 11:15.979
We're busted!

11:16.023 --> 11:17.783
You little troublemakers
are going away for a long...

11:17.807 --> 11:19.374
A ramp?!

11:19.417 --> 11:21.768
I haven't gone off a ramp
since I was a kid!

11:21.811 --> 11:23.204
Watch this!

11:23.247 --> 11:27.121
Time to fly like an eagle, baby!

11:27.164 --> 11:29.340
I broke my ass!

11:29.384 --> 11:31.255
I'm so embarrassed!

11:31.299 --> 11:33.910
They're gonna put me
in a big plaster diaper!

11:33.954 --> 11:35.695
Oh, no!

11:46.009 --> 11:48.925
You came!

11:48.969 --> 11:50.753
You're interested in radio!

11:51.841 --> 11:55.323
Don't push me into
the closet I sleep in!

11:59.153 --> 12:02.243
Palmer Elymas... the Vista View
Apartments on Third Street.

12:02.286 --> 12:04.462
Mm, is there someone
special you'd like

12:04.506 --> 12:06.464
to dedicate this love song to?

12:06.508 --> 12:08.945
<i>A very important
woman in my life.</i>

12:08.989 --> 12:12.166
<i>Just thinking about her
makes my heart race.</i>

12:12.209 --> 12:14.690
Love is just so, so special.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.084
<i>She's a cartoon bird
with big, red lips</i>

12:17.127 --> 12:19.564
<i>that's in these
car-insurance commercials.</i>

12:19.608 --> 12:21.523
<i>She sounds incredible.</i>

12:21.566 --> 12:22.979
<i>Here's Peter Cetera's
"Glory of Love"</i>

12:23.003 --> 12:24.363
<i>from</i> The Karate Kid II <i>
soundtrack.</i>

12:27.964 --> 12:30.140
This tree is dry.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.882
The roots have been
squeezed of moisture by kids

12:32.926 --> 12:34.579
doing jumps off the sidewalk.

12:37.974 --> 12:41.804
Four kids to be precise...
three normals and a large.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.066
They're heading east.

12:43.110 --> 12:45.677
Whoa! This guy's driving
on the sidewalk!

12:45.721 --> 12:47.331
And I'll tell you
something else.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.768
People want to see someone

12:48.811 --> 12:50.528
with a little paunch,
a guy who works for a living

12:50.552 --> 12:51.727
have sex in the van.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.902
Fine. Let's go.

12:52.946 --> 12:54.556
R-R-Right now?

12:54.599 --> 12:56.558
- Yes.
- But... but who's gonna drive?

12:56.601 --> 12:58.168
We'll park.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.822
P-People need to see
the trees going by.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.476
Tonight or never.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.739
Okay, okay.
But I'm frizzing out.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.524
At least let me wet down my hair
in a gas-station bathroom.

13:06.568 --> 13:07.850
You've got to let me
make it nice.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.353
Please!

13:13.880 --> 13:18.841
Hmm. Makeshift ramp,
a loser with broken butt.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.451
I've solved it.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.149
This fool was trying
to relive his youth.

13:22.192 --> 13:24.412
Maybe to impress some kids?

13:24.455 --> 13:27.110
Judging by how dry
his mouth feels,

13:27.154 --> 13:29.721
I'd say the boys left here
about 45 minutes ago.

13:29.765 --> 13:32.333
Get your hands out of my mouth!

13:32.376 --> 13:34.050
If you're looking for those
boys, they went...

13:34.074 --> 13:36.163
Stop! I want to
track them only by seeing

13:36.206 --> 13:37.860
how moist things are.

13:40.907 --> 13:44.867
Okay, best-case scenario,
Palmer's tied up inside.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.271
So we can't just knock
on the door.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.697
Barry, no!

13:48.740 --> 13:51.091
What if the agents
of Big Fluoride are...

13:51.134 --> 13:53.484
Palmer? Y-You're okay!

13:53.528 --> 13:55.051
I thought something
happened to you.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.661
Something <i>did</i> happen to me!

13:56.705 --> 13:59.229
I have a toothache,
which is crazy,

13:59.273 --> 14:03.146
because I wipe my teeth with
a hand towel three times a day!

14:03.190 --> 14:04.713
Uh, how do you know who I am?

14:04.756 --> 14:07.498
From <i>The Wondercabinet.
I'm a fan.</i>

14:07.542 --> 14:09.109
And guess what.

14:09.152 --> 14:11.763
I astral-projected
right into your apartment.

14:11.807 --> 14:14.244
Where... where are
the astral charts?

14:14.288 --> 14:15.898
Where are the crystals?

14:15.942 --> 14:19.859
It's just a bunch of posters
of... race cars?

14:19.902 --> 14:21.599
Yeah!
You can't even drive

14:21.643 --> 14:23.906
this one on the street
it's so fast.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.342
I-Is there another room?

14:25.386 --> 14:28.258
Another room?! I work in radio.

14:28.302 --> 14:30.870
Who do you think I am?
King Ralph?

14:30.913 --> 14:32.349
I astral-projected!

14:32.393 --> 14:34.830
Really? That's wild!

14:34.874 --> 14:36.223
I'd love to do that.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.225
But... but you have.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.053
You said so on your show.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.663
I just made that up.

14:41.706 --> 14:44.622
So I didn't astral-project.

14:44.666 --> 14:47.190
And you're just another
sad adult.

14:47.234 --> 14:52.804
I am so sick of sad adults!

14:52.848 --> 14:54.894
Aah!

14:54.937 --> 14:56.243
My Lamborghini Veneno!

14:56.286 --> 14:58.245
Steve, he's okay.

14:58.288 --> 15:00.247
Why are you so upset?

15:00.290 --> 15:01.857
We're supposed to pick a path,

15:01.901 --> 15:03.946
but they all lead
to the same place...

15:03.990 --> 15:06.079
a small, sad life!

15:06.122 --> 15:08.168
I thought there was another way,
but there isn't!

15:08.211 --> 15:10.692
They should call you boys
Hurricane Katrina,

15:10.735 --> 15:12.955
'cause you've been leaving
water all over town.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.088
And you!

15:15.131 --> 15:17.481
You want me to live the
smallest, worst life of all...

15:17.525 --> 15:18.482
yours!

15:18.526 --> 15:22.573
You're a hagfish!

15:22.617 --> 15:23.923
Aaaaaaaah!

15:25.533 --> 15:30.320
Whoa! Is that his pineal gland?

15:30.364 --> 15:33.410
Steve!

15:51.646 --> 15:53.561
The astral plane.

15:53.604 --> 15:55.041
I'm here.

15:55.084 --> 15:57.391
Oh, God, I'm actually here!

15:57.434 --> 15:59.088
It's real!

15:59.132 --> 16:01.743
Okay, how does it work?
How does it work?

16:01.786 --> 16:06.748
I should be able to just think
of a place and go, say Paris.

16:06.791 --> 16:09.533
Magnifique!

16:09.577 --> 16:13.973
I can go anywhere,
even Chimdale.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.020
Wow! Chimdale!

16:18.064 --> 16:20.718
It's like Paris on steroids.

16:20.762 --> 16:24.331
It's all so beautiful!
I want to see everything.

16:24.374 --> 16:27.116
I want to see everything Palmer
lied about getting to see,

16:27.160 --> 16:29.989
to every time and every place,

16:30.032 --> 16:32.992
to the last moment
of the universe!

16:37.561 --> 16:39.302
Sad ending.

16:39.346 --> 16:41.870
Got to stop reading
the last page of a book first.

16:41.913 --> 16:46.266
Now show me dinosaurs!

16:48.877 --> 16:50.313
Incredible!

16:50.357 --> 16:52.707
The feathers are
so unpleasant, though.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.453
Bu-gawk!

16:59.496 --> 17:00.976
Oh, just awful.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.849
Now show me everything!

17:44.628 --> 17:46.152
There we go.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.631
Hey, you're great.

17:47.675 --> 17:49.242
You're a nice guy.

17:49.285 --> 17:50.591
People want to see you
do things.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.419
Did you get in shape
the way you wanted?

17:52.462 --> 17:54.116
No, of course not.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.702
Did you eat like you were
an actor trying to gain

17:55.726 --> 17:56.771
100 pounds for a role?

17:56.814 --> 17:58.120
Yeah. So what?

17:58.164 --> 18:01.602
Now are you ready to smash?
Yeah.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.299
I said, are you ready to smash?!

18:03.343 --> 18:05.345
Yes! Let me really hear it.

18:05.388 --> 18:07.086
I'm gonna smash!

18:07.129 --> 18:08.348
Yeah!

18:11.002 --> 18:13.701
No! H-Help!

18:13.744 --> 18:15.790
Can anyone hear me?

18:15.833 --> 18:16.921
Where the hell is Teddy?

18:16.965 --> 18:18.749
I'm in here! My hair is wet.

18:18.793 --> 18:20.273
I'm ready for sex!

18:20.316 --> 18:21.578
You know, I was thinking,

18:21.622 --> 18:23.624
what if we just used
a green screen

18:23.667 --> 18:25.408
instead of driving around
all the time?

18:25.452 --> 18:27.149
No! That's terrible!

18:27.193 --> 18:28.759
That could totally work.

18:28.803 --> 18:31.980
No! Why can I hear you
and you can't hear me?!

18:32.023 --> 18:33.590
We wouldn't need
a driver at all!

18:33.634 --> 18:35.157
I'm having a panic attack!

18:37.942 --> 18:39.553
Well, Roger's at it again.

18:39.596 --> 18:40.554
What next?

18:40.597 --> 18:41.990
Oh!

18:42.033 --> 18:43.818
That strange room.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.385
I forgot about that.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.256
If it wasn't Palmer's room,
what was it?

18:49.476 --> 18:51.652
I'm back! This is it!

18:51.695 --> 18:54.045
But where is this?

18:54.089 --> 18:55.960
Let's take it back in time.

18:59.529 --> 19:02.010
It's Dad's study.

19:04.099 --> 19:06.667
Where are you?

19:06.710 --> 19:08.103
Where did you go?

19:20.594 --> 19:21.812
Help me!

19:21.856 --> 19:24.250
Oh, God, help me!

19:24.293 --> 19:26.513
Dad was the one
calling for help...

19:26.556 --> 19:28.123
to save me.

19:31.387 --> 19:33.868
Steve! You came back!

19:33.911 --> 19:35.652
Be careful.
That's Waterford glass.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.698
I've traveled so far, Dad,

19:37.741 --> 19:40.309
to every corner
of this universe.

19:40.353 --> 19:41.963
I've seen so much.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.573
Did I end up getting cast
as Hamilton

19:43.617 --> 19:45.053
in the movie version
of <i>Hamilton?</i>

19:45.096 --> 19:46.359
No.

19:46.402 --> 19:48.665
Well, I owe Tuttle
a million dollars.

19:48.709 --> 19:50.145
There's something I need to say.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.278
No. You're back.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.497
We don't have to talk
ever again.

19:54.541 --> 19:56.891
I apologize for calling you
a hagfish

19:56.934 --> 19:58.893
and saying your life was small,

19:58.936 --> 20:01.330
for thinking anyone's life
was small.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.550
I wanted something infinite,
but I didn't realize

20:03.593 --> 20:05.552
I had it right here.

20:05.595 --> 20:08.511
A love so big it moved us
across time and space

20:08.555 --> 20:10.600
to find each other.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.950
Is that what you couldn't
figure out how to say, Dad?

20:12.994 --> 20:14.822
Is that what you wanted me
to understand?

20:14.865 --> 20:17.781
No. That's stupid.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.087
And even if it was what I felt,

20:19.130 --> 20:21.872
how dare you say it out loud.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.700
Don't touch me.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.572
Get away from me!

20:26.877 --> 20:29.402
What's say we pop open
that third eye,

20:29.445 --> 20:31.578
do a little astral
projecting together.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.540
I'm haunting my own house.

20:39.063 --> 20:40.630
Boo!

20:42.066 --> 20:43.503
Boo!

20:43.546 --> 20:45.461
Dad, I told you
they can't see us.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.637
What's the point then?
This sucks.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.770
I'll show you something
that doesn't suck.

20:51.075 --> 20:53.164
Whoa! Chimdale.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.992
Now, this I could get used to.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.646
Right?!

20:56.690 --> 20:58.344
Bye! Have a great time!
