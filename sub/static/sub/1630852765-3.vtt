a Timoring.

It's a shapeshifter
that manifests

09:30.003 --> 09:32.137

and kills them with it,

its next victim.

Otherwise, it's...

09:48.155 --> 09:50.021
pretty much unkillable.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.823

done and dusted,

10:04.637 --> 10:07.172
all you need to do is get
its amygdala for the orb.
