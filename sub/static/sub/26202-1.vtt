WEBVTT

00:07.675 --> 00:13.445
And I have to admit
that I was uh... thrilled.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.647
Living vicariously
through her.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.683
<i>And when did you start
to see red flags?</i>

00:19.620 --> 00:21.086
I didn't.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074

00:47.148 --> 00:50.449
Sarah, remind me to re-think
the whole skirt thing.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.650
A bit cold?

00:51.752 --> 00:55.020
Yeah, and I just low-key flashed
your neighbour.

00:55.122 --> 00:57.189
Oh, your hair is fierce.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.124
Maybe I'll just chop it all off.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.028
<i>Girls?</i>

01:05.933 --> 01:08.734
Skirt shipment is missing
and Christophe is freaking out

01:08.836 --> 01:10.202
so I have to go into work.

01:10.304 --> 01:14.306
Extra cream for you,
and black for you, my love.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.274
Alright, girls.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.843
What is on your agenda
for today?

01:17.945 --> 01:20.112
Let's see... crashing a party?

01:20.214 --> 01:21.113
No?

01:21.215 --> 01:22.214
Um, matching tattoos.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.783
Um, actually there's a-

01:24.885 --> 01:26.785
there's a big wrestling match
after school.

01:26.887 --> 01:27.753
We might go.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.354
Supposedly there will be
free pot.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.823
Wow. Alright.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.391
So um, you're gonna be home...

01:32.493 --> 01:34.026
A little before dinner?

01:34.128 --> 01:34.960
Perfect.

01:35.062 --> 01:36.628
Alright, bye. I love you.

01:36.730 --> 01:37.596
<i>Bye.</i>

01:37.698 --> 01:38.730

02:34.355 --> 02:35.554
Ohhhh!!!!!

02:37.758 --> 02:40.225
Wow, when did Gus get ripped?

02:40.327 --> 02:42.995
Are you objectifying
that amazing athlete?

02:43.097 --> 02:44.630
Well, I'm just saying
his body got hot.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.098
Is that objectifying him?

02:47.902 --> 02:50.102
I prefer bachelor number two.

02:50.204 --> 02:50.903
Really?

02:51.005 --> 02:52.137
Mmm.

02:52.239 --> 02:53.705
Who is that, even?

02:53.807 --> 02:55.707
Rob Tennison.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.476
<i>He transferred in last month.</i>

02:57.578 --> 02:59.912
<i>Apparently just to be
wrestling captain.</i>

03:00.014 --> 03:01.446
<i>West Sound poached him?</i>

03:01.549 --> 03:03.081
West Sound has good taste.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.956
Get him! Get him!

03:11.058 --> 03:12.491
Come on, man!

03:17.531 --> 03:18.297
Keep it tight on him!

03:18.399 --> 03:19.631
Let's go!

03:28.909 --> 03:30.676
Okay, shake hands.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.914
Get some manners,
nerf herder!

03:44.325 --> 03:45.824
Shake hands please.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.800
Damn, what got into you?

03:54.902 --> 03:57.569
I couldn't say.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.105
But I like it.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.246
Miss C., are you cooking?

04:07.348 --> 04:09.214
Is it safe to eat?

04:09.316 --> 04:11.783
Hey, I cook when motivated.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.819
Does motivation have a name?

04:13.921 --> 04:14.786
Timothy.

04:14.888 --> 04:15.754
Occupation?

04:15.856 --> 04:16.588
Architect.

04:16.690 --> 04:17.689
Mmm.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.926
And I'm betting he likes
Italian food.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.094
Where'd you meet him?

04:22.196 --> 04:23.295
I bought him a drink a couple
of days ago.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.496
He comes into the store
all the time

04:24.598 --> 04:25.931
because he's friends
with Christophe.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.300
I don't know, I've had my eye
on him for a little bit.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.768
You bought him a drink?

04:29.870 --> 04:31.036
Um...

04:31.138 --> 04:33.238
Rob Tennison just added me?

04:33.340 --> 04:34.239
Who's Rob Tennison?

04:34.341 --> 04:35.207
Uh, uh-

04:35.309 --> 04:36.708
McDreamy junior.

04:36.810 --> 04:40.212
Sarah defended his honour
at the wrestling match today.

04:40.314 --> 04:41.246
Holy shit.

04:41.348 --> 04:42.581
Hey, Sarah Joy Collins.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.383
It was called for.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.350
He's outside.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.184
Outside where?

04:46.287 --> 04:47.286
Outside outside.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.954
He's outside.

04:55.029 --> 04:56.061
Hi, I'm Rob.

04:56.163 --> 04:57.362
Hi. I'm Miss Collins.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.930
Miss Collins, nice to meet you.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.065
Why don't you come on in?

05:00.167 --> 05:01.066
Thank you.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.501
I was just wondering
if Sarah wanted

05:02.603 --> 05:04.102
to come for coffee or cocoa.

05:04.204 --> 05:06.738
There's a new shop that just
opened up a few blocks away.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.707
Uh, I said I'd study
with Nikki.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.008
Oh hey, don't bring me
into this.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.109
I gotta bounce.

05:11.211 --> 05:12.377
I wouldn't say no
to a hot chocolate.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.845
We have pre-calc homework.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.113
Oh hey, I do too.

05:15.215 --> 05:18.083
I'll have you back in plenty
of time to finish.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.618
There's whipped cream on top.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.619
Yeah, yeah.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.487
At ease, soldier.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.523
Arm thoroughly twisted.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.490
Let me get that for you.

05:25.592 --> 05:26.591
Oh.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.027
Alright, after you.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.529
Thank you.

05:33.067 --> 05:36.034
If Rob really was such
a bad guy,

05:36.136 --> 05:37.736
how could you have
missed it?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.771
Ok, just look at him.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.475
He's smart.

05:43.577 --> 05:48.613
And he's charming.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.416
He's right out of
a Jane Austen novel.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.254
And he picked Sarah.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.691
Oh my god!

05:59.793 --> 06:01.393
Where did that even
come from?

06:01.495 --> 06:03.261
Ok, but West Sound
is so tiny.

06:03.364 --> 06:07.399
It is tiny, so why haven't
we bumped into each other?

06:07.501 --> 06:10.869
Um... we don't really run
in the same circles.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.637
What is this, an Austen novel?

06:12.740 --> 06:13.939
Gasp.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.474
He reads?

06:15.576 --> 06:16.508
Occasionally.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.443
Just enough to impress
the smart girls.

06:18.545 --> 06:19.544
I'm not that smart.

06:19.646 --> 06:20.846
Mmm. Who said I was talking
about you?

06:22.750 --> 06:23.749
Oh, that's gonna leave a mark.

06:23.851 --> 06:24.549
Alright, come on.

06:24.651 --> 06:25.450
You are that smart.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.618
You're a nerd.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.720
Nerd is a strong word.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.422
I'm sorry, would you prefer
nerf herder?

06:31.859 --> 06:32.991
Hey, I happen to like
nerf herders.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.727
I've always been
a Star Wars fan.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.562
And uh, I may be partial
to nerds, as well.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.898
Especially the humble ones
who have no idea

06:40.000 --> 06:41.366
how pretty they are.

06:41.468 --> 06:42.934
Oh...

06:45.038 --> 06:46.238
how did you know where I live?

06:48.642 --> 06:50.308
I may have bribed the student
office assistant

06:50.411 --> 06:51.443
to pull up your address.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.644
Right.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.045
What'd you bribe her with?

06:54.148 --> 06:55.113
A date with Gus.

06:55.215 --> 06:56.281
Uh, that reminds me,

06:56.383 --> 06:57.215
I should tell him he has plans
on Saturday.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.185
Actually, it wasn't that hard.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.420
People pay attention to you.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.821
Even if you don't realize it.

07:02.923 --> 07:06.958
Well, it's-it's either very
impressive or very creepy.

07:07.060 --> 07:07.826
I'm flattered.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.294
Oh.

07:09.396 --> 07:10.395
Here, come here.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.764
Oh, alright.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.367
Perfect.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.102
Hey, let's get out of this rain.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.008
It went that well, huh?

07:23.110 --> 07:24.342
It was nice.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.711
He um... he invited me and Nikki

07:26.814 --> 07:29.281
to his friend Zach's birthday
on Friday.

07:29.383 --> 07:30.182
That's alright?

07:30.284 --> 07:31.616
Two dates in one week?

07:31.718 --> 07:32.784
Rob is on the offensive.

07:32.886 --> 07:33.518
I'm impressed.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.820
It's not a date.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.087
It's a party.

07:36.190 --> 07:37.923
I don't wanna...
make things weird.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.024
Right, right.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.760
You all play it cool
as you do.

07:41.862 --> 07:42.961
That was loaded.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.063
No, baby, it's just that
this is the first time

07:45.165 --> 07:48.233
I've seen you even remotely
interested in anyone

07:48.335 --> 07:49.267
in that way.

07:49.369 --> 07:50.535
And Rob just doesn't-
I don't know,

07:50.637 --> 07:52.737
seem like somebody
you need to overthink.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.541
How do you still do it?

07:56.643 --> 07:57.642
What, date?

07:57.744 --> 07:58.777
Yeah.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.913
Well, some people are happy
being alone

08:02.015 --> 08:03.815
and others want a partner.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.283
I'm the second one.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.685
Even after dad?

08:06.787 --> 08:08.119
Especially after your father.

08:09.389 --> 08:10.755
And Rob is nothing
like your dad.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.057
You Googled him?

08:12.159 --> 08:13.525
Obviously.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.495
Oh.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.163
I like seeing you get out
of your comfort zone.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.030
Mmm.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.332
Makes mama very happy.

08:21.602 --> 08:22.300
Happy.

08:22.402 --> 08:23.802
Muah.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.212
Welcome, I'm Alexa.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.313
Bathroom's down there, no
go zone's over to the right,

08:36.416 --> 08:37.916
and all the food's right
over here.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.417
It's Sarah, right?

08:39.520 --> 08:40.184
That's right.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.352
And this is Nikki.

08:41.455 --> 08:42.320
Hey.

08:42.422 --> 08:43.655
Boo!

08:44.024 --> 08:45.423
If you're drinking
use discretion,

08:45.526 --> 08:46.324
know what I'm saying?

08:46.426 --> 08:48.660
No puking and no drunks.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.561
Alright.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.729
Well, that's the type of shit

08:50.831 --> 08:51.930
that gets you kicked off
the wrestling team.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.198
And out of this house.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.099
Damn.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.000
Rob's a hard-ass.

08:55.102 --> 08:55.834
He's classy.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.569
Oh, no, no.
Your classy?

08:57.671 --> 08:59.271
Come on, Zack,
I want to dance.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.107
Ok.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.943
I think we need a code word for
"get me the hells out of here".

09:05.045 --> 09:05.844
I'm thinking "juice box".

09:05.946 --> 09:07.212
I don't wanna play it cool.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.283
That is not one word.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.717
Yeah, I like him.

09:12.819 --> 09:16.388
Like... like really like him.

09:16.490 --> 09:17.656
I don't wanna play it cool.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.091
Ok, then don't.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.927
I can't compete with that.

09:23.330 --> 09:27.032
Jacqueline is so beautiful.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.466
Sarah.

09:28.569 --> 09:32.170
The right guy is gonna
like you for you.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.906
If Rob is the right guy
then there's no competition.

09:35.008 --> 09:35.574
Ok.

09:35.676 --> 09:36.341
Ok?

09:36.443 --> 09:37.709
So just go be you.

09:37.811 --> 09:38.510
Uh...

09:38.612 --> 09:39.844
Ok?

09:39.947 --> 09:41.379
Go!

09:43.116 --> 09:44.049
Uh, sort of.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.116
Um... It looks really-

09:45.218 --> 09:46.785
Hey!

09:46.887 --> 09:48.753
Thank you for coming.
I'm so glad you're here.

09:48.855 --> 09:49.387
Oh, well thanks for having me.

09:49.489 --> 09:50.288
Thank you.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.323
You look nice.

09:51.425 --> 09:52.057
Let me introduce you.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.024
Yes.

09:53.126 --> 09:53.992
Hey guys.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.026
Uh, this is Sarah.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.928
Sarah, this is Zach, Alexa...

09:57.030 --> 09:58.763
Happy birthday.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.165
She just met him.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.600
You gotta control your man.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.468
It's his birthday.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.337
He can do whatever he wants.

10:05.439 --> 10:06.638
I got an excuse.

10:12.779 --> 10:16.114
Sometimes I just like to come
out here and clear my head.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.816
You know, when things
get a little much.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.051
Ok.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.420
I didn't mean to get
all zen on you.

10:22.522 --> 10:23.822
Do you trust me?

10:23.924 --> 10:25.924
Mmm, jury's still out.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.627
Awe, come on.
You trust me.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.228
Close your eyes.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.603
What, did you think
I was gonna drop you?

10:38.705 --> 10:42.107
No, actually.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.508
Good.

10:46.713 --> 10:51.783
Sorry, I guess this isn't the
most traditional first date.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.119
I didn't even know
it was a date.

10:54.221 --> 10:57.322
Didn't even think
about it, so...

10:57.424 --> 10:58.690
well in that case...

11:00.160 --> 11:04.162

Well, get lost, weirdo.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.059
Here, let me take this for you.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.760
Oh, thank you.

11:35.862 --> 11:36.995
Can I help you?

11:37.097 --> 11:38.496
Uh, you're in third period Lit,
right?

11:38.598 --> 11:40.231
Well, yeah. You know that.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.701
I was wondering if you could
help me find Mr. Simmons' class.

11:42.803 --> 11:46.271
Uh, that sounds like an excuse
to walk with me.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.772
Yeah, come on.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.241
Ok, but my thesis is that
Stephenson's characters

11:50.343 --> 11:51.776
don't act like real people.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.112
Right, and I disagree with you,
by the way.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.147
Oh, I couldn't tell.

11:56.249 --> 11:59.050
Ok, well how about
we discuss it further

11:59.152 --> 12:00.819
at the lake house this weekend?

12:00.921 --> 12:02.153
Celebrate our massive milestone?

12:02.255 --> 12:04.089
One month is a milestone?

12:04.191 --> 12:05.790
If I get to steal you away,
it is.

12:05.892 --> 12:06.825
Come on, it'll be fun.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.761
The whole gang's going,
no adults.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.162
Can I bring Nik?

12:13.166 --> 12:14.065
If she's a necessity.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.973
Someone more interesting
than me?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.275
It's just Darren from math club.

12:24.377 --> 12:27.312
I missed last week.
He's wondering why.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.580
Hmm.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.689
That's why.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.190
So that was aggressive.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.892
Hey, I don't like being
interrupted.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.393
And besides, this essay
is due Monday,

12:42.496 --> 12:45.029
I'm gonna have no time to work
on it on the weekend

12:45.132 --> 12:48.433
because I am going to be
doing other things.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.436
You wouldn't happen to have
another motivation

12:51.538 --> 12:54.606
for taking me to your romantic
lake house, would you?

12:54.708 --> 12:55.774
There's a small chance.

12:55.876 --> 12:56.474
Mmmhmm.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.776
It's tiny. Miniscule.

12:57.878 --> 12:58.743
Right.

12:58.845 --> 13:01.246
In that case we better focus.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.552
Did you do the pre-calc
homework?

13:07.654 --> 13:08.753
Yeah. Are you stuck?

13:08.855 --> 13:10.054
Yeah.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.389
I can't get past
the first question.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.624
I don't know why.

13:12.726 --> 13:15.527
I don't know how to do
any of... this.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.563
Crap.

13:18.665 --> 13:22.200
Sorry, I-he's... he's freaked
about his essay.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.368
I'll-I'll help you in a sec.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.669
Hang on.

13:24.771 --> 13:25.970
Ok.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.979
You think because English
is easy for you

13:35.081 --> 13:36.347
that it should be easy
for everyone.

13:36.449 --> 13:37.715
Not true.

13:37.818 --> 13:38.917
This is important to me.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.552
Good grades are important
to me.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.953
Yeah.

13:42.055 --> 13:45.890
And if you're gonna be
a distraction then this?

13:45.992 --> 13:47.325
This is a hazard.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.626
And it has no point.

13:48.728 --> 13:49.894
Yeah, I'm-I'm not getting
pissed at my best friend

13:49.996 --> 13:51.729
because she asked for help.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.097
And were you not the one
who started

13:53.200 --> 13:54.098
talking about the weekend?

13:54.201 --> 13:55.366
Hey, don't turn
this around on me,

13:55.468 --> 13:56.367
I don't like to be manipulated!

14:00.507 --> 14:07.879
<i>♪ Something tells me
I'm not alone. ♪</i>

14:07.981 --> 14:08.546
<i>♪ I feel.. ♪</i>

14:08.648 --> 14:09.848
Woah.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.717
Sorry Nikki.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.986
I guess we got a little
carried away.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.354
Clearly.

14:16.456 --> 14:20.391
I'll just wait over there
'til you're... finito.

14:42.582 --> 14:43.848
<i>You should go into hairstyling.</i>

14:43.950 --> 14:45.049
Yeah, my mom would love that.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.184
Oh.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.019
I could stay home and cook her
a meatloaf

14:48.121 --> 14:50.021
and clean her ashtrays
'til I'm 60.

14:50.123 --> 14:50.955
Like I'd let you.

14:51.858 --> 14:52.490
Muah.

14:52.592 --> 14:53.658
Thanks.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.326
Hey, are you guys sure
that Rob's dad is ok

14:55.428 --> 14:56.628
with the whole picking
you up thing?

14:56.730 --> 14:59.197
Oh, what are those?

14:59.299 --> 15:01.266
Uh, Timothy is taking me
rock climbing.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.201
You realize that means you have
to climb rock.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.304
Yes, but it was either that
or not see him for a week.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.606
He couldn't change his rock
climbing schedule?

15:08.708 --> 15:10.375
Ok, let's focus on you two,
shall we?

15:10.477 --> 15:12.310
I know that I am
the super cool mom

15:12.412 --> 15:15.546
but I need some assurances
about this weekend away.

15:15.649 --> 15:18.182
Ok, Rob's lawyer dad's
gonna be there

15:18.285 --> 15:19.450
plus all the guys
on the wrestling team.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.319
Like, they literally can't do
anything stupid

15:21.421 --> 15:23.254
or they get kicked off
the roster.

15:23.356 --> 15:26.190
But you can drive us if it
would make you feel better.

15:27.994 --> 15:30.295
Just means you'd have to cancel
on Timothy.

15:32.198 --> 15:35.400
Ok, um... make sure you
text me when you get there,

15:35.502 --> 15:36.701
and I get at least
one phone call.

15:36.803 --> 15:37.368
Muah.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.369
Love you.

15:38.471 --> 15:39.203
Love you.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.505
Have fun. Don't break anything.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.073
Except hearts!

15:45.712 --> 15:47.645
His dad's gonna be there?

15:47.747 --> 15:49.113
I lied.

What took you so long, man?

16:11.137 --> 16:12.170
I know, traffic was crazy.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.371
Welcome, welcome, though.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.439
Hey, how're you doing?

16:14.541 --> 16:15.139
Hi.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.408
What's up?

16:17.510 --> 16:20.812
So uh... what do you think?

16:20.914 --> 16:22.347
It's ok.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.514
It's gorgeous.

16:23.616 --> 16:24.549
It's gorgeous.

16:29.289 --> 16:33.424

16:33.526 --> 16:35.126
I'm gonna go get
some marshmallows.

16:35.228 --> 16:38.062
Sweetie, refined sugar
will age you.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.230
She's not gonna put it
on her face,

16:39.332 --> 16:40.231
she's gonna eat it.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.868
Jacqueline is on
another cleanse.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.269
<i>Chris Tucker lookin' ass.</i>

16:45.372 --> 16:46.904
<i>Jackie Chan lookin' ass.</i>

16:48.708 --> 16:51.042
<i>It would be awkward to toast
marshmallows in there, anyway.</i>

16:51.144 --> 16:53.644
<i>Too bad.</i>

16:53.747 --> 16:55.380
That's a darling necklace,
Sarah.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.280
Oh.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.648
Gift from Rob?

16:57.751 --> 16:59.617
Um, Nikki, actually.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.487
Wait, doesn't buy you
jewellery yet?

17:02.589 --> 17:03.654
He's usually all over that.

17:03.757 --> 17:05.790
Because you know him
so well?

17:05.892 --> 17:08.192
No jewellery.

17:08.294 --> 17:09.127
Deal me out this round.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.661
But he's been writing me poems.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.266
Leave it to you to find the only
guy who can take down

17:15.367 --> 17:18.869
a 200 pound dude
and writes poems.

17:18.972 --> 17:20.938
Yeah, I'm gonna need proof.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.140
No passcode?

17:22.242 --> 17:23.741
Guess we haven't gotten
to the sugar fix yet.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.209
Or have we?

17:25.310 --> 17:26.511
Give it back, Jay.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.880
You do not touch
another lady's phone.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.184
Only if she reads Rob's poem.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.852
Otherwise I might
find something better.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.387
Fine.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.522
Two lines.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.061
Boy, you so crazy!

17:44.731 --> 17:46.697
"You are mine.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.067
"Mine alone.

17:49.169 --> 17:53.371
"The perfect gem
I'll forever adore."

17:58.311 --> 17:59.077
Oops.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.044
<i>Not cool.</i>

18:00.146 --> 18:01.012
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

18:01.114 --> 18:02.246
Robbie. Stop!

18:02.348 --> 18:04.115
Those were private!

18:04.217 --> 18:07.452
Girls like to share their
boyfriend's romantic gestures.

18:07.554 --> 18:08.920
It's a compliment.

18:09.022 --> 18:11.355
They were laughing at me.

18:11.458 --> 18:12.457
You were laughing at me.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.125
No, Robbie.

18:14.227 --> 18:17.995
I just wish that you would treat
me with a little more respect!

18:25.505 --> 18:26.204
Oh my god, baby-

18:26.306 --> 18:27.305
Why did you do that?

18:27.407 --> 18:29.740
I'm so sorry, I-it wasn't
on purpose.

18:29.843 --> 18:30.475
Here, come here.

18:30.577 --> 18:31.209
Show me where it hit you.

18:32.045 --> 18:32.810
Oh my god.

18:32.912 --> 18:33.311
Where did-where did it hit you?

18:33.413 --> 18:34.011
Let me see.

18:34.114 --> 18:34.979
Oh..

18:35.081 --> 18:37.081
I... it wasn't on purpose.

18:37.183 --> 18:38.749
You made me angry and-
and I was using my hands

18:38.852 --> 18:39.951
and it just flew
out of my fingers.

18:40.053 --> 18:41.119
Look, I'll get you a new phone.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.420
A better one.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.522
I was reading what you wrote
because it was sweet.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.991
And romantic and who knew
you'd have a freak out?

18:47.093 --> 18:48.025
You're right.

18:48.128 --> 18:51.129
Obviously I overreacted
and I'm sorry.

18:51.231 --> 18:54.832
It's just-I've been trying
to tell you something.

18:54.934 --> 18:59.604
Something that I haven't told
any other girl before.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.506
It scares me.

19:01.608 --> 19:02.940
It scares you?

19:03.042 --> 19:04.542
Yeah.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.179
I love you, Sarah.

19:09.716 --> 19:10.882
Oh.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.817
Oh? Is that all you have to say?

19:12.919 --> 19:13.718
Oh?

19:14.854 --> 19:16.120
I love your hands.

19:16.222 --> 19:20.825
And your skin, and your laugh,
and how smart you are.

19:20.927 --> 19:24.996
I love everything about you.

19:25.098 --> 19:29.800
When I think about you not
feeling the same way...

19:29.903 --> 19:30.935
say you feel the same way.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.570
I- I feel the same way.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.238
You love me?

19:34.340 --> 19:35.907
Yes.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.742
I love you.

20:33.199 --> 20:34.031
There you are.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.333
Hey.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.300
What's the matter?

20:36.402 --> 20:38.236
Nothing.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.537
Why?

20:39.639 --> 20:40.838
You look like you've
been crying.

20:40.940 --> 20:41.706
Oh, yeah.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.474
We were just out by the lake.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.775
I got a little wind burned.

20:44.877 --> 20:45.810
Oh.

20:45.912 --> 20:46.844
Hey, you uh, ready to go?

20:46.946 --> 20:48.079
Mmmhmm.

20:48.181 --> 20:49.046
Go...

20:49.148 --> 20:50.881
Yeah, it's so beautiful
out there,

20:50.984 --> 20:51.949
we're gonna go in the boat.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.584
Oh, well that sounds awesome.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.686
Let me grab a jacket.

20:55.788 --> 20:56.921
Hey.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.823
Alright, Tennison,
let's do this.

20:58.925 --> 21:03.361
Oh, Nik, um... it-it's kinda
like a couple thing.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.295
Oh!

21:04.397 --> 21:05.096
You don't mind, do you?

21:05.198 --> 21:06.264
We'll go another time-

21:06.366 --> 21:08.065
Yeah, of course. I get it.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.066
Ok.

21:09.168 --> 21:10.334
See ya.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.903
Wear a life jacket!

21:13.006 --> 21:13.971
Hey, Nikki.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.140
Um, listen, I've been
meaning to say,

21:16.242 --> 21:18.843
you're a good sport,
being the third wheel.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.945
A lot of girls can
handle that.

21:28.421 --> 21:31.188
We are going in the lake!

21:31.291 --> 21:32.556
<i>Alright!</i>

21:40.099 --> 21:41.732
<i>Safety first.</i>

21:50.810 --> 21:53.077
Wow.

21:53.179 --> 21:54.945
This is happening.

21:55.048 --> 21:57.214
We can just sleep in the same
bed if you want.

21:57.317 --> 22:00.284
We don't have to have sex.

22:00.386 --> 22:03.020
It would be a waste of these
good candles

22:03.122 --> 22:05.990
but we don't have to.

22:06.092 --> 22:09.994
Yeah, these pyjamas kinda say
"cuddling only".

22:10.096 --> 22:11.295
Oh, hell no.

22:11.397 --> 22:13.764
They say "effortlessly sexy".

22:15.168 --> 22:17.735
Subtly sensual.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.337
Casually erotic.

22:27.880 --> 22:33.250
Plus, they're not staying on
for long, anyway.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.720
That was the subtext.

22:52.004 --> 22:55.906
Wait...

22:56.008 --> 22:59.844
did you mean you actually
love me or were you...

22:59.946 --> 23:03.013
I don't say things
unless I mean them.

23:03.116 --> 23:05.182
I can tell you again now.

23:05.284 --> 23:08.085
But I'd rather show you.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.725
I'm not going anywhere,
Sarah.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.733
But if you want me to stop,
tell me now.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.702
You don't have to stop.

23:41.487 --> 23:45.823
<i>♪ Going to do what I want
and that's what's up, ♪</i>

23:45.925 --> 23:47.425
<i>♪ Ain't lookin' for a man
to hold me up, ♪</i>

23:47.527 --> 23:48.459
Bye.

23:50.463 --> 23:54.698
<i>♪ Black coat, pink balaclava, ♪</i>

23:54.801 --> 23:56.167
Pick.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.576
I even set it up and charged it
for you.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.578
I don't like you being
without a phone.

24:07.680 --> 24:08.646
Mmm.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.782
Mmm-mmm.

24:11.884 --> 24:12.917
Thank you.

24:13.019 --> 24:13.951
I should have made you
the lock screen,

24:14.053 --> 24:15.352
you're cuter.

24:25.465 --> 24:26.464
Oh, hey, babe.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.165
First ring, that's
what I like to see.

24:28.267 --> 24:29.633
<i>What're you up to?</i>

24:29.735 --> 24:32.169
I really need to study
for my bio test.

24:32.271 --> 24:33.270
Sorry.

24:33.372 --> 24:34.472
Ah, hey, don't apologize.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.507
I like smart girls, remember?

24:36.609 --> 24:38.175
Call me if you need a break.

24:38.277 --> 24:39.810
Definitely.

24:51.057 --> 24:51.922
Hey, Nik-

24:52.558 --> 24:53.724
<i>Sarah...</i>

24:53.826 --> 24:55.593
Calm down. What's wrong?

24:59.398 --> 25:02.500
I hate staying in
that freaking house.

25:02.602 --> 25:05.703
I've literally packed
my bags like four times.

25:05.805 --> 25:08.639
Maybe you should talk
to someone.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.808
Nik, she needs help.

25:10.910 --> 25:11.876
AA or-

25:11.978 --> 25:15.379
She's not hurting anybody
but herself.

25:15.481 --> 25:17.147
If people knew it would
get worse for me.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.183
I'm already a known weirdo.

25:25.358 --> 25:27.057
Could it be any more pink?

25:28.594 --> 25:30.094
I'll be able to find it
in my bag.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.496
You could find it
in a black hole.

25:32.598 --> 25:33.564
Here.

25:33.666 --> 25:34.498
Right now?

25:34.600 --> 25:35.633
She's so beautiful.

25:35.735 --> 25:36.166
Stop, wait.

25:36.269 --> 25:37.101
Oh, look at her!

25:37.203 --> 25:38.002
Give me like five seconds.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.036
Ok, fine.

25:39.138 --> 25:40.137
Look at you.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.972
Oh, what an angel.

25:43.342 --> 25:44.041
Oh, you're the worst.

25:44.143 --> 25:44.975
Oh, I'm posting that one.

25:45.077 --> 25:45.976
Please don't.

25:46.078 --> 25:48.379
Oh my gosh,
that's so embarrassing.

25:48.481 --> 25:49.346
Oh, no.

25:49.448 --> 25:50.180
You like this filter?

25:50.283 --> 25:51.315
It's actually cute.

25:51.417 --> 25:52.349
Wait, Sarah.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.185
What the hell?

25:55.288 --> 25:58.889
Oh, uh... yeah, I fell.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.991
On the rocks.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.826
When I was chasing after Robbie.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.395
So you had been crying.

26:04.497 --> 26:07.998
Sorry, I-I didn't want him
to be embarrassed.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.067
He felt really bad that I fell,
so.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.138
I shouldn't have been so nosy.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.573
I shouldn't have-

26:15.675 --> 26:18.208
I shouldn't have read the stupid
text in the first place.

26:18.311 --> 26:19.710
They were private.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.612
I would have been pissed if he
read the guys some of my texts.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.247
Oh, really?

26:23.349 --> 26:24.515
Why?

26:24.617 --> 26:26.483
Sarah Collins, what have you
been texting?

26:26.586 --> 26:28.886
Just... stuff for him
to think about.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.120
Well, careful.

26:30.222 --> 26:31.021
It starts with a phone
and then it leads to-

26:31.123 --> 26:33.958
I know where it leads.

26:34.060 --> 26:34.925
What?

26:36.262 --> 26:37.928
Sarah, you didn't.

26:38.030 --> 26:38.696
Really?

26:40.099 --> 26:41.865
That's why you weren't
in the bed when I woke up.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.234
I thought you had just gone
to the bathroom.

26:44.337 --> 26:46.003
Oh my gosh.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.339
Uh... was he nice?

26:48.441 --> 26:49.139
Were you safe?

26:49.241 --> 26:50.574
Nikki.

26:50.676 --> 26:52.543
Hey, even smart girls do stupid
things under pressure-

26:52.645 --> 26:53.811
He didn't pressure me.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.112
Ah.

26:55.214 --> 26:56.847
If I knew I was gonna
get interrogated

26:56.949 --> 26:59.283
I woulda just kept
my mouth shut.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.318
Did you talk about it
with your mom?

27:01.420 --> 27:03.187
Hard pass.

27:03.289 --> 27:07.424
She doesn't need to know
everything I do.

27:07.526 --> 27:09.226
He said he loved me.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.195
And he thinks we have
a future.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.596
He-he said it like that.

27:12.698 --> 27:13.831
"A future".

27:15.568 --> 27:16.400
Wow.

27:22.908 --> 27:24.274
No, no, no, no, no.

27:24.377 --> 27:25.075
Rob, no.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.677
Are you ok? What's going on?

27:26.779 --> 27:29.380
Um, I'm fine, I just need
a minute.

27:29.482 --> 27:30.848
I need to call Rob.

27:30.950 --> 27:31.915
Okay.

27:35.988 --> 27:40.457
Babe, no... it-
it wasn't planned.

27:40.559 --> 27:41.725
<i>Nikki was upset.</i>

27:41.827 --> 27:43.394
Upset about what?

27:43.496 --> 27:44.328
I can't say.

27:44.430 --> 27:45.763
<i>You're a shitty liar.</i>

27:45.865 --> 27:48.999
<i>You picked her over me,
just say it!</i>

27:49.101 --> 27:51.769
Um, do you mind just giving me
some privacy?

27:51.871 --> 27:53.003
I- I'm just gonna
be two seconds.

27:53.105 --> 27:53.871
Just go in the bathroom.

27:53.973 --> 27:54.705
Is that ok?

27:54.807 --> 27:55.673
Ok. Yeah.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.174
It's fine.

28:03.582 --> 28:05.082
Her mom's a drunk.

28:05.184 --> 28:08.085
She just-she just needed a
place to get away for a while.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.487
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

28:10.589 --> 28:12.756
I- I promised I wouldn't
tell people.

28:12.858 --> 28:15.192
I'm not people,
I'm your boyfriend.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.494
<i>You say you love me but
how am I supposed to feel</i>

28:17.596 --> 28:19.063
<i>when you lie like that?</i>

28:19.165 --> 28:21.265
I- I'm sorry, it's not
what I meant.

28:21.934 --> 28:24.268
<i>Relationships are about
communication, Sarah.</i>

28:24.370 --> 28:26.403
<i>If you really cared about us,
about me,</i>

28:26.505 --> 28:27.504
<i>you would have said something.</i>

28:27.606 --> 28:29.173
<i>I would never do that to you.</i>

28:41.620 --> 28:42.419
Hey.

28:42.521 --> 28:43.520
<i>You've spent a lot of time</i>

28:43.622 --> 28:44.888
<i>at the Tennison's lake house,
right?</i>

28:44.990 --> 28:46.657
Do you know the-
the neighbour?

28:46.759 --> 28:48.559
The girl next door?

28:48.661 --> 28:50.794
She and Rob ever date?

28:50.896 --> 28:52.096
Um, yeah.

28:52.198 --> 28:53.097
They dated last summer.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.264
She's at Overlake Academy.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.567
She threw a huge tantrum
when uh,

28:56.669 --> 28:58.569
Rob decided to come
here instead.

28:58.671 --> 29:00.070
<i>What's up?</i>

29:00.172 --> 29:02.606
Can you trust me for a little
bit and I'll tell you later?

29:02.708 --> 29:03.507
Promise.

29:03.609 --> 29:04.608
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

29:04.710 --> 29:06.577
Thanks.

29:15.187 --> 29:18.555
It feels like it's
happening fast.

29:18.657 --> 29:20.557
Maybe too fast.

29:20.659 --> 29:21.692
It's intense.

29:21.794 --> 29:25.829
Yeah, well... it's your
first boyfriend.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.131
Everything is intense.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.165
Everything-

29:28.267 --> 29:31.802
But like... he texts me
all the time.

29:31.904 --> 29:34.638
He wants to know where I am,
who I'm with.

29:34.740 --> 29:36.006
It's...

29:36.108 --> 29:37.174
It just sounds
like he's jealous.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.243
I need him to trust me,
though.

29:39.345 --> 29:43.514
Not... control me.

29:43.616 --> 29:44.481
Right?

29:44.583 --> 29:47.251
Absolutely.

29:47.353 --> 29:49.186
So talk to him.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.789
You know, tell him
how you feel.

29:51.891 --> 29:52.923
People aren't perfect.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.159
He's gonna have some flaws.

29:55.261 --> 29:56.860
He says he loves me.

29:57.730 --> 29:58.462
No.

29:58.564 --> 29:59.596
No?

29:59.698 --> 30:01.131
No.

30:01.233 --> 30:02.466
No, he does not.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.001
Oh my god, seriously?

30:04.103 --> 30:05.169
Yeah.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.337
Wow.

30:07.439 --> 30:08.872
See?

30:08.974 --> 30:12.376
I mean, honey, he's obviously
just as freaked out as you are.

30:15.981 --> 30:19.216
Mom...

30:19.318 --> 30:23.921
do you ever worry that you're
making the wrong choice?

30:24.023 --> 30:26.023
Like... like you feel

30:26.125 --> 30:31.628
like someone's the right person
and then they're not?

30:31.730 --> 30:34.665
Absolutely.

30:34.767 --> 30:40.971
And then I remember that
that very same type of person

30:41.073 --> 30:43.941
is the reason why I have you.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.476
Life's complicated.

30:46.579 --> 30:48.111
Thanks mom.

30:48.214 --> 30:49.713
You ok, kiddo?

30:49.815 --> 30:51.014
Yeah. Yeah.

30:51.116 --> 30:51.815
Yeah?

30:51.917 --> 30:53.317
Mmmhmm.

30:53.419 --> 30:59.590
Rob would call and Sarah
would... snatch up the phone.

30:59.692 --> 31:04.161
You know, like she just couldn't
wait to talk to him.

31:04.263 --> 31:07.264
Now I know that um,

31:07.366 --> 31:10.968
if she didn't answer right away
he would get angry.

31:14.106 --> 31:20.944
She worried that he was
too controlling.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.713
But I just thought that
it was sweet

31:22.815 --> 31:26.183
because I thought that it meant
that he didn't wanna lose her.

31:30.756 --> 31:33.056
Hi.

31:33.158 --> 31:34.391
Whatcha got there?

31:34.493 --> 31:36.994
Uh, it's a dress for Sarah.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.862
Hmm.

31:38.964 --> 31:41.331
Rob, we don't keep secrets.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.934
Sarah and I, we talk.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.068
About us?

31:45.170 --> 31:47.037
Among other things.

31:47.139 --> 31:48.939
Look, she's never had
a relationship before

31:49.041 --> 31:51.008
and I'm guessing that you have.

31:51.110 --> 31:52.943
Not like this.

31:53.045 --> 31:56.513
She's... different.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.181
She'll make mistakes.

31:58.284 --> 32:01.051
Miss Collins, there is nothing
Sarah could do

32:01.153 --> 32:04.621
to change the way I feel
about her.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.623
I don't wanna lose her.

32:06.725 --> 32:08.091
I like her.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.496
Alright, come in.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.331
You can call me Laura,
by the way,

32:14.433 --> 32:15.632
if it's not too weird.

32:15.734 --> 32:16.833
Thanks.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.605
Ok, I'm gonna be checking in
periodically

32:21.707 --> 32:22.739
so be a gentleman.

32:22.841 --> 32:23.573
Cross my heart.

32:23.676 --> 32:24.508
Mmmhmm.

32:36.522 --> 32:38.388
Rob... no.

32:38.490 --> 32:39.790
This is way too expensive.

32:39.892 --> 32:42.960
Awe, I want you to have
the best.

32:43.062 --> 32:45.028
I love it.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.330
But where will I wear it?

32:46.432 --> 32:48.398
Oh, hilarious.

32:55.007 --> 33:00.143
Will you forgive me for jumping
to conclusions?

33:00.245 --> 33:01.878
Maybe put on the dress?

33:01.981 --> 33:03.380
Ok.

33:06.418 --> 33:07.651
Turn around.

33:07.753 --> 33:09.052
I've seen it all before.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.387
Remember?

33:27.606 --> 33:29.206
Hope you kept the receipt.

33:29.308 --> 33:30.807
Don't worry,
you'll lose the weight.

33:30.909 --> 33:32.075
Besides, I'll help you.

33:32.177 --> 33:35.612
Like you said, we have
a whole month.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.414
You think I'm fat?

33:37.516 --> 33:38.382
Did I say that?

33:38.484 --> 33:39.249
No.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.751
I chose you.

33:40.853 --> 33:43.320
I want you.

33:48.293 --> 33:50.794
My-my mom was serious,
she could come in at any time.

33:50.896 --> 33:54.998
Well I guess we'll have to be
quick and quiet.

33:55.100 --> 33:57.034
I won't tell if you don't.

34:30.168 --> 34:31.034
Yes!

34:31.136 --> 34:32.002
I actually really like this.

34:32.103 --> 34:33.203
You look so cute.

34:33.304 --> 34:34.538
Let me see the back?

34:34.639 --> 34:36.039
See? I told you it would fit.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.607
Yeah, I'm shocked
I fit into this.

34:37.708 --> 34:42.312
You were so worried.

34:42.414 --> 34:45.581
Oh. One sec.

34:52.991 --> 34:53.690
Ow.

34:53.792 --> 34:54.925
Sorry.

34:55.027 --> 34:55.692
Is that ok?

34:55.793 --> 34:56.760
Yeah.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.295
Thank you.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.065
You look so pretty.

35:02.167 --> 35:02.732
Thanks.

35:02.835 --> 35:03.467
You look so cute.

35:03.569 --> 35:04.601
Thank you.

35:04.703 --> 35:05.602
Um...

35:05.704 --> 35:06.269
Do you feel good?

35:06.371 --> 35:07.204
Yeah.

35:07.306 --> 35:08.505
You should be,
you look so hot.

35:08.607 --> 35:09.706
I'm gonna take a selfie.

35:21.086 --> 35:21.952
Nice!

35:29.695 --> 35:30.360
Hi.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.495
So I was thinking um...

35:31.597 --> 35:34.064
What you're wearing
is unacceptable.

35:34.166 --> 35:35.765
Cover up. Now.

35:38.303 --> 35:39.202
I... I thought it was cute.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.537
<i>Are you re-branding?</i>

35:40.639 --> 35:43.173
Trying to get some attention
by flashing leg and ass?

35:43.275 --> 35:46.376
You look like a cheap slut.

35:46.478 --> 35:49.646
Delete it.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.815
You know, nobody else wants you,
Sarah.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.683
It's just me.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.520
Sometimes I'm not sure why.

36:02.027 --> 36:03.727
Sarah, are you ok?

36:03.829 --> 36:04.494
He's being an asshole-

36:04.596 --> 36:06.296
Don't call him that!

36:10.602 --> 36:13.904
She came to school
with bruises.

36:14.006 --> 36:16.373
It... it was embarrassing.

36:16.475 --> 36:20.243
I showed her how to hide them
with make-up.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.512
<i>And you knew the bruises
were from Rob?</i>

36:22.614 --> 36:24.915
I did, but he was a nice guy.

36:25.017 --> 36:26.416
To me.

36:26.518 --> 36:27.918
And to his friends.

36:28.020 --> 36:31.021
In other words he never hit
you so it wasn't your business.

36:43.569 --> 36:49.172
<i>♪ You're deep in my abyss, ♪</i>

36:52.277 --> 36:53.276
Oh, god.

36:53.378 --> 36:54.778
I am so sorry.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.581
I- I thought Rob was home alone.

36:57.683 --> 36:58.782
May I help you?

36:58.884 --> 37:02.953
Um, I'm Sarah Collins.

37:03.055 --> 37:05.455
His girlfriend?

37:05.557 --> 37:07.490
He never tells me anything.

37:07.593 --> 37:08.658
Well, you know, if-if
he's training

37:08.760 --> 37:09.626
I won't-I won't bother him.

37:09.728 --> 37:10.327
I can just-

37:10.429 --> 37:11.695
No, no, don't be silly.

37:11.797 --> 37:12.429
You're here now.

37:12.531 --> 37:13.496
Come.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.966
He's been down there an hour,
anyways.

37:20.272 --> 37:21.404
<i>Robert?</i>

37:22.774 --> 37:25.342
Look who I found.

37:25.444 --> 37:26.943
<i>I told him to clean up
the mess.</i>

37:27.045 --> 37:27.644
Oh...

37:27.746 --> 37:29.045
Alright?

37:29.147 --> 37:30.347
Now this lovely young lady
can see your true colours.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.148
Well, this is my space, mom.

37:32.251 --> 37:34.651
I did read that messy people
have high IQ's.

37:34.753 --> 37:35.518
I'm running out.

37:35.621 --> 37:36.820
I'm late for my class,

37:36.922 --> 37:38.221
but perhaps Sarah could join us
for dinner tonight?

37:38.323 --> 37:40.757
I have to keep training
so maybe another time.

37:40.859 --> 37:41.992
Well, it was lovely meeting you,
Sarah.

37:42.094 --> 37:43.493
Mmmhmm.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.028
And I'm sorry that my son has
not introduced us previously.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.768
It's ok.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.037
I already know you're messy.

37:54.139 --> 37:55.805
Great.

37:55.907 --> 37:58.041
Now that I have your stamp
of approval,

37:58.143 --> 37:59.943
what're you doing here?

38:00.045 --> 38:04.214
Um... I came to apologize.

38:06.084 --> 38:08.251
<i>About what I was wearing.</i>

38:08.353 --> 38:09.986
Hmm.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.454
You sure you didn't come here
to force your way

38:11.556 --> 38:13.723
into meeting my mother?

38:13.825 --> 38:15.225
You said your parents were away.

38:15.327 --> 38:16.326
I don't remember
saying that.

38:16.428 --> 38:17.093
Yes, you do.

38:17.195 --> 38:17.761
No, I don't.

38:17.863 --> 38:18.561
You lied.

38:18.664 --> 38:19.362
No, because you nagged me.

38:19.464 --> 38:20.864
You're always nagging me!

38:22.734 --> 38:23.633
Sarah.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.035
Sarah! Come back here!

38:31.610 --> 38:32.309
You knew they were home!

38:32.411 --> 38:33.310
No!

38:33.412 --> 38:34.778
No, I came to spend time
with you!

38:34.880 --> 38:38.315
I love you but you treat me
like garbage!

38:38.417 --> 38:40.417
You only focus on
the things I don't do

38:40.519 --> 38:42.919
and you have
this list of expectations

38:43.021 --> 38:45.789
that I keep failing at!

38:48.360 --> 38:50.193
My dad gets home from work soon.

38:50.295 --> 38:51.494
I don't want him seeing you
like this.

38:51.596 --> 38:52.929
You know what?

38:53.031 --> 38:55.598
Screw you!

38:55.701 --> 38:58.501
If that's how you feel
then we are done!

38:58.603 --> 39:00.670
Don't call me, don't-
don't message me,

39:00.772 --> 39:03.373
don't come within
five feet of me!

39:44.983 --> 39:53.156
<i>♪ It was all pretend. ♪</i>

39:53.258 --> 39:54.424
Hi.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.593
Something happen?

39:56.695 --> 39:59.095
Oh, uh...

39:59.197 --> 40:05.668
Timothy finally decided
that he wants to get serious.

40:05.771 --> 40:07.570
Just not with me.

40:07.672 --> 40:09.539
No.

40:09.641 --> 40:10.640
Oh, mom, I'm sorry.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.075
Oh, it's ok.

40:12.177 --> 40:14.377
I'm just sorry that you have
to see me like this again.

40:16.982 --> 40:18.882
Don't answer it.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.049
You're upset.

40:20.152 --> 40:24.220
They can handle the store
without you once.

40:24.322 --> 40:26.356
Let's have a girl's night.

40:26.458 --> 40:27.957
We will. I promise.

40:28.059 --> 40:28.792
This weekend.

40:28.894 --> 40:30.660
I have to take this.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.330
<i>The shipment was supposed
to be there yesterday.</i>

40:36.435 --> 40:37.767
<i>Ok, you know what?</i>

40:37.869 --> 40:41.604
<i>Um, why don't you give me
20 minutes and I'll handle it.</i>

40:41.706 --> 40:42.705
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

40:42.808 --> 40:44.374
<i>No problem.</i>

40:50.682 --> 40:52.582
You could knock.

40:52.684 --> 40:54.818
Ok, um, I have to go into work.

40:54.920 --> 40:57.454
Surprise, surprise.

40:57.556 --> 41:00.857
Weird, I don't recall a major
attitude-fest being scheduled

41:00.959 --> 41:04.494
for this evening and...
what happened to your knee?

41:04.596 --> 41:05.395
Nothing.

41:05.497 --> 41:06.429
I tripped.

41:08.033 --> 41:09.999
Rob and I had a fight.

41:10.101 --> 41:14.103
Most couples fight,
don't start a hashtag.

41:14.206 --> 41:15.205
Ok.

41:15.307 --> 41:19.776
Um... did it happen
when you...

41:19.878 --> 41:21.211
did Rob get pushy about-

41:21.313 --> 41:21.878
No! God!

41:21.980 --> 41:23.179
I- I was upset.

41:23.281 --> 41:24.447
I didn't look where I was going.

41:24.549 --> 41:26.983
Rob wasn't even there.

41:27.085 --> 41:28.351
And-and I don't appreciate you

41:28.453 --> 41:30.286
jumping to the worst conclusion,
either.

41:30.388 --> 41:34.090
Just because your relationships
constantly crash and burn.

41:34.192 --> 41:35.425
Wow, you're gonna go there.

41:35.527 --> 41:39.329
Well, maybe you should try
being yourself for once.

41:39.431 --> 41:40.797
Instead of trying
to mould yourself

41:40.899 --> 41:41.931
into what you think
a man wants.

41:42.033 --> 41:43.867
And even Christophe, right?

41:43.969 --> 41:45.368
He says "jump" you say
"how high?"

41:45.470 --> 41:46.769
Christophe is my boss.

41:46.872 --> 41:49.405
I just wanna scream at you
just to say no to someone.

41:49.508 --> 41:50.406
Just-just one time.

41:50.509 --> 41:51.608
Just one damn time.

41:51.710 --> 41:54.143

You can't be here.

43:42.320 --> 43:43.686

43:43.788 --> 43:44.887

you hurt me!

43:44.990 --> 43:47.256
Please, there is an explanation.

43:47.359 --> 43:48.391
Ok?

43:48.493 --> 43:50.126
My family, they have traditions
and rules-

43:50.228 --> 43:51.928
So-so you're worried
I'm not good enough?

43:52.030 --> 43:54.664
No. No.

43:54.766 --> 43:56.432
When I tell them I'm not going
to Harvard

43:56.534 --> 43:59.302
because I refuse to move away
from you

43:59.404 --> 44:03.239
that's not gonna go over well.

44:03.341 --> 44:05.441
I wanted to introduce you
to my parents

44:05.543 --> 44:10.947
when we were ready and...
when it could be perfect.

44:11.049 --> 44:12.415
The perfect place,
the perfect time.

44:12.517 --> 44:13.883
You in perfect clothes.

44:13.985 --> 44:18.855
Just so that they could see
why I wouldn't wanna leave you.

44:18.957 --> 44:24.093
Robbie, that wasn't
a normal fight.

44:24.195 --> 44:25.528

44:25.630 --> 44:30.733

44:30.835 --> 44:34.771
But you are making me better.

44:34.873 --> 44:36.472
Please, Sarah.

44:36.574 --> 44:39.609
Don't-don't give up on me.

44:39.711 --> 44:42.078
You don't give up on
the people you love.

44:42.180 --> 44:44.614
I was gonna give this to you
at the dance

44:44.716 --> 44:48.618
but it feels like
you need it now.

44:52.257 --> 44:54.257
It's a promise ring.

45:00.331 --> 45:02.465
You're gonna stop losing your
temper and taking it out on me.

45:02.567 --> 45:03.666
I swear, I will-

45:03.768 --> 45:06.569
And I'm gonna wear whatever
the hell I want.

45:06.671 --> 45:07.570
Of course.

45:07.672 --> 45:09.739
You look beautiful to me,
always.

45:09.841 --> 45:16.279
And now you're gonna take me
for hot chocolate

45:16.381 --> 45:19.782
and we're gonna start over.

45:19.884 --> 45:21.484
Clean slate.

45:22.921 --> 45:24.687
Clean slate.

45:25.090 --> 45:31.627

46:45.036 --> 46:48.371
So you guys broke up
for a few hours

46:48.473 --> 46:51.707
then got back together?

46:51.810 --> 46:53.810
Right in time for the dance
tonight, I guess.

46:53.912 --> 46:57.146
Look, we addressed
some issues first.

46:57.248 --> 46:58.681
He slut shamed you.

46:58.783 --> 47:01.951
In front of a bunch of people.

47:02.053 --> 47:04.153
He apologized.

47:04.255 --> 47:05.021
We dealt with it.

47:05.123 --> 47:06.489
Ok, yeah, no, here's the thing.

47:06.591 --> 47:07.590
You can lie to everyone.

47:07.692 --> 47:08.524
I didn't-

47:08.626 --> 47:09.926
Don't even!

47:10.028 --> 47:11.627
You can lie to everyone,
you can even lie to your mom,

47:11.729 --> 47:14.297
but I am your best friend
and I'm not friggen' blind.

47:14.399 --> 47:15.765
He hurts you.

47:15.867 --> 47:17.834
Physically. Verbally.

47:17.936 --> 47:20.469
You seriously think I believe
you tripped at the lake house?

47:23.708 --> 47:25.541
He doesn't mean to.

47:25.643 --> 47:26.509
Of course not.

47:26.611 --> 47:28.010
He-he gets angry,
he lashes out.

47:28.112 --> 47:30.313
But that's-that's actually one
of the things we talked about.

47:32.483 --> 47:35.918
He's a good person,
Nik.

47:36.020 --> 47:37.787
And I promise he's going
to do better now.

47:37.889 --> 47:39.121
No, he's not!

47:39.224 --> 47:41.023
He loves me, and it's not
all his fault, you know?

47:41.125 --> 47:45.228
I've... I've been pushing him
to do things before he's ready.

47:45.330 --> 47:48.064
I- I can do better, too.

47:48.166 --> 47:50.399
I love him, Nikki.

47:52.237 --> 47:55.204
You have loved him
this whole time.

47:55.306 --> 47:57.673
You don't give up on someone
you love, Nik.

47:57.775 --> 47:59.976
And I know for you walking out
is actually an option

48:00.078 --> 48:03.045
and you can't wait to do it
but for me it's not.

48:31.542 --> 48:33.910
Gus, you also went to
the Tennison's lake house

48:34.012 --> 48:35.278
quite regularly, right?

48:35.380 --> 48:36.078
Yes.

48:36.180 --> 48:38.247
So you and Mr. Cahill,

48:38.349 --> 48:39.916
all of you three were wrestlers

48:40.018 --> 48:42.852
trained in the same way that
Mr. Tennison was.

48:42.954 --> 48:45.321
You didn't even believe Rob
was capable of hurting anyone

48:45.423 --> 48:47.623
until your girlfriend
convinced you.

48:51.429 --> 48:53.095
Cara Levitt?

48:53.197 --> 48:54.397
Yes?

48:56.334 --> 48:57.700
Hi.

48:57.802 --> 48:59.168
Um, my name's Nikki.

48:59.270 --> 49:01.837
I was wondering if I could talk
to you about Rob Tennison?

49:03.574 --> 49:05.074
The Tennison's lake house?

49:05.176 --> 49:07.944
Remember, I saw you,
you saw me?

49:08.046 --> 49:09.946
You were scared.

49:10.048 --> 49:12.615
I wanna know why.

49:12.717 --> 49:17.186
I dated Rob last summer and he
got a little riled up one day.

49:17.288 --> 49:18.321
I was over it.

49:18.423 --> 49:20.122
Now I avoid him.

49:20.224 --> 49:23.793
Explain to me why any of this
matters to you?

49:23.895 --> 49:26.195
My best friend's dating him.

49:26.297 --> 49:29.699
He gets a little more
than riled up with her.

49:29.801 --> 49:31.400
The first time he was
so apologetic

49:31.502 --> 49:34.770
I actually believed
that it was unintentional.

49:34.872 --> 49:39.141
I decided I just have to avoid
making him that angry.

49:39.243 --> 49:45.047
But the second time he hit me
with a pool cue.

49:45.149 --> 49:46.415
Did you report him?

49:46.517 --> 49:47.583
Did you tell your parents-

49:47.685 --> 49:49.018
No. I didn't wanna be that girl.

49:49.120 --> 49:51.020
Not a particularly
attractive label.

49:51.122 --> 49:52.521
I just left.

49:52.623 --> 49:54.156
Ghosted him.

49:56.427 --> 49:58.160
I can't get Sarah to walk.

49:58.262 --> 50:00.363
She thinks she's in love.

50:00.465 --> 50:03.366
Probably because she is.

50:03.468 --> 50:05.601
I thought about
making her choose,

50:05.703 --> 50:07.803
him or me,

50:07.905 --> 50:13.242
but... she'll choose him.

50:13.344 --> 50:14.810
The best thing you can do
for your friend

50:14.912 --> 50:16.512
is not make her choose.

50:16.614 --> 50:20.750
Be there for her whether she
stays with him or she doesn't.

50:20.852 --> 50:22.852
Ok.

50:22.954 --> 50:24.954
Thanks.

50:38.569 --> 50:39.535
Wow.

50:43.007 --> 50:44.874
You look perfect.

50:49.580 --> 50:50.546
Laura...

50:52.583 --> 50:53.849
I got these for you.

50:53.951 --> 50:56.052
Thank you.

50:56.154 --> 50:58.454
Sarah told me you were going
through a break up.

50:58.556 --> 51:00.923
The guy is an idiot
for the record.

51:01.025 --> 51:03.659
But... this is a wonderful
family

51:03.761 --> 51:05.995
and I'm honoured to be
a part of it.

51:08.833 --> 51:09.632
Thank you.

51:09.734 --> 51:10.332
I love you.

51:10.435 --> 51:11.333
Love you.

51:11.436 --> 51:12.768
Have a good time.

51:15.706 --> 51:16.939
No, don't-don't mess up
my lipstick.

51:17.041 --> 51:17.606
Come here.

51:17.708 --> 51:18.808
Muah.

51:25.483 --> 51:26.982
Apres vous.

51:34.692 --> 51:37.259
You-you look really nice.

51:37.361 --> 51:38.928
Thanks.

51:40.565 --> 51:42.565
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

51:42.667 --> 51:44.300
No.

51:47.839 --> 51:49.939
Oh, she's here.

51:50.041 --> 51:50.806
Rob.

51:50.908 --> 51:51.974
Rob, I'm not joking right now.

51:52.076 --> 51:53.442
Oh, ok. Alright. Alright.

51:53.544 --> 51:55.811
We will take a photo, but only
because you look so cute.

51:55.913 --> 51:56.912
Here's a crown for you.

51:57.014 --> 51:57.847
Ooh.

52:02.854 --> 52:04.753
Awe, I love you.

52:04.856 --> 52:06.322
I love you, too.

52:40.691 --> 52:42.224
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

52:42.326 --> 52:44.059
Ha Farrow, no more talking.

52:44.162 --> 52:44.760
Let's dance!

52:44.862 --> 52:46.362
Let's go, come on!

52:46.464 --> 52:48.063
Okay.

53:00.511 --> 53:01.877
You ok?

53:01.979 --> 53:03.145
<i>She's trippin'.</i>

53:03.247 --> 53:04.580
<i>I don't know what
I'm supposed to do, man.</i>

53:04.682 --> 53:06.015
<i>She makes it so hard.</i>

53:06.117 --> 53:07.149
Oh my god!

53:07.251 --> 53:08.651
It's so good to see you!

53:08.753 --> 53:10.252
I don't know.

53:10.354 --> 53:13.622
I don't understand.

53:13.724 --> 53:15.424
I haven't seen you forever!

53:15.526 --> 53:16.859
I know I miss you guys.

53:20.565 --> 53:21.564
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

53:21.666 --> 53:22.831
<i>What's his problem?</i>

53:26.938 --> 53:28.103
Let go of me, Rob!

53:28.206 --> 53:30.206
You were flirting
right in front of me,

53:30.308 --> 53:31.273
we were in there 10 minutes!

53:31.375 --> 53:32.274
I wasn't flirting!

53:32.376 --> 53:33.909
I was talking!

53:35.513 --> 53:37.112
Hey! Get off!!!

53:37.215 --> 53:38.180
Get in the car!

53:38.282 --> 53:39.915
Sarah, I don't wanna fight
in public!

53:40.017 --> 53:41.150
You don't have to go with him!

53:41.252 --> 53:42.585
What he just did is not ok!

53:42.687 --> 53:44.253
This is between us, Nikki.

53:44.355 --> 53:45.854
Not anymore.

53:45.957 --> 53:47.289
Remember what I said, Sarah.

53:47.391 --> 53:49.792
She is jealous and
she's squeezing her way in.

53:49.894 --> 53:51.994
This is exactly
what I predicted, isn't it?

53:52.096 --> 53:55.264
Sarah, I don't care
who you date.

53:55.366 --> 53:56.599
You can get in the car
with him if you want,

53:56.701 --> 53:58.701
I'm still gonna be
your best friend.

53:58.803 --> 54:00.836
I'm not going anywhere.

54:00.938 --> 54:03.239
But I am telling you,
you don't deserve this.

54:03.341 --> 54:05.841
I'm scared, Nik.

54:05.943 --> 54:07.409
He won't let me go.

54:07.511 --> 54:08.877
Tough shit.

54:08.980 --> 54:10.145
Neither will I.

54:10.248 --> 54:10.946
Get in the car!

54:11.048 --> 54:12.214
Get in the car, Sarah!

54:12.316 --> 54:13.849
Get out of my way, Gus.

54:13.951 --> 54:16.218
Not a chance.

54:25.329 --> 54:26.395
It's ok.

54:28.566 --> 54:30.266
He can't hurt you.

54:34.171 --> 54:36.805
She loved him, too.

54:36.907 --> 54:41.543
Despite everything, she didn't
want his life to be ruined.

54:44.815 --> 54:48.284
He hit her with a pool cue?

54:48.386 --> 54:49.918
We should go to the police.

54:50.021 --> 54:51.587
File charges.

54:51.689 --> 54:54.323
Maybe.

54:54.425 --> 54:55.324
I don't know.

54:55.426 --> 54:56.325
He needs some sort
of consequence

54:56.427 --> 54:57.559
or he'll just keep doing it.

54:57.662 --> 54:59.895
Well, I'm not ready to ruin
his life just yet.

55:04.235 --> 55:05.901
What about your mom?

55:09.473 --> 55:11.640
She'll be too disappointed.

55:11.742 --> 55:12.941
I couldn't handle it.

55:13.044 --> 55:14.376
No she wouldn't.

55:14.478 --> 55:16.312
She'd wanna lock the snake
away and throw away the key.

55:16.414 --> 55:18.280
She'd be disappointed I didn't-

55:18.382 --> 55:19.448
I didn't bolt the first time
he hit me.

55:19.550 --> 55:20.516
Hold up. No. No.

55:20.618 --> 55:21.717
Ok, look at me.

55:21.819 --> 55:24.219
This isn't on you.

55:24.322 --> 55:26.155
You didn't do anything wrong.

55:29.760 --> 55:33.028
You love him.

55:33.130 --> 55:34.663
I did.

55:37.435 --> 55:40.235
I loved him.

55:42.606 --> 55:44.406
And you know, that's what makes
me so mad,

55:44.508 --> 55:48.210
is he's still there.

55:48.312 --> 55:49.645
He-he exists.

55:49.747 --> 55:56.452
This... this guy who is smart
and-and ambitious and...

55:56.554 --> 55:59.555
and who made me feel like...

55:59.657 --> 56:03.058
like I was the best thing
that ever happened to him.

56:03.160 --> 56:07.262
He's still there.

56:07.365 --> 56:12.701
And he still wants me.

56:12.803 --> 56:17.206
And I still want him.

56:17.308 --> 56:18.974
I know.

56:19.076 --> 56:21.744
I know, it sucks.

56:21.846 --> 56:26.582
But the one half of him
can't justify the other, Sar.

56:26.684 --> 56:29.685
It's still who he is right now.

56:29.787 --> 56:31.820
Maybe always.

56:35.059 --> 56:37.459
Thank you.

56:37.561 --> 56:40.796
For being here.

56:40.898 --> 56:43.165
Still.

56:43.267 --> 56:44.867
Like you said.

56:44.969 --> 56:48.036
You don't give up
on the ones you love.

56:55.179 --> 56:57.846
I'll go to his wrestling coach.

56:57.948 --> 57:00.215
Rob respects him.

57:00.317 --> 57:02.684
He'll know what to do,
if anything.

57:02.787 --> 57:04.653
Maybe he can make him
go to anger management.

57:04.755 --> 57:06.021
Yeah.

57:06.123 --> 57:08.424
He'll want to know everything,
start to finish.

57:20.237 --> 57:23.372
A picture says a thousand words,
right?

57:32.283 --> 57:33.816

58:25.569 --> 58:26.835
Relax.

58:26.937 --> 58:28.203
Gus says they don't have
practise this morning.

58:28.305 --> 58:30.105
What if he comes in to train
on his own?

58:30.207 --> 58:31.740
Sarah, he can't hurt you.

58:31.842 --> 58:34.643
Not with Mr. P right there.

58:34.745 --> 58:37.913
Plus, I know some moves.

58:38.015 --> 58:38.780
Mmm.

58:38.883 --> 58:40.516
You're lethal.

58:53.030 --> 58:56.465
Um...

58:56.567 --> 59:00.068
I think...

59:00.170 --> 59:01.637
I think I changed my mind.

59:01.739 --> 59:03.272
What?

59:03.374 --> 59:04.406
Everyone will know, Nik.

59:04.508 --> 59:06.341
Sarah, come on.

59:06.443 --> 59:07.776
Screw him, you're
not the villain here, he is!

59:07.878 --> 59:10.245
Yeah, 'cause they'll believe me!

59:10.347 --> 59:13.448
You know what Jacqueline
told me about Cara?

59:13.551 --> 59:15.951
She said she stalked Rob.

59:16.053 --> 59:18.987
That she was mental.

59:19.089 --> 59:21.890
They love him, Nik.

59:21.992 --> 59:26.261
My-my words won't matter.

59:26.363 --> 59:27.229
Sarah-

59:27.331 --> 59:28.263
It's my decision.

59:30.701 --> 59:33.669
Ok. You're right.

59:33.771 --> 59:35.971
What do you wanna do?

59:36.073 --> 59:41.310
Um... I wanna...

59:41.412 --> 59:47.983
I wanna pretend like this never
happened and I wanna go home.

01:00:04.068 --> 01:00:05.567
Rob and I broke up.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.804
Sweetie.

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.886
Is he seeing someone else?

01:00:24.989 --> 01:00:26.989
No.

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:29.625
Well, it's just that yesterday
I would have said

01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:32.794
that he would take
a bullet for you.

01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:34.296
Seems like you're
leaving something out-

01:00:34.398 --> 01:00:36.164
Yeah, I'm leaving lots out but
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:37.132
Sarah.

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:39.635
I'm just not what he wants.

01:00:39.737 --> 01:00:45.207
And I don't wanna be with him
if that's the case.

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:49.211
I know it's disappointing.

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:50.912
Hey.

01:00:51.015 --> 01:00:52.714
Hey, look at me.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:57.486
You have never been
a disappointment.

01:00:57.588 --> 01:01:01.089
I'm sorry if I ever made you
feel that way.

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:03.291
You liked Rob.

01:01:03.394 --> 01:01:08.063
I felt like-like it made you
proud that I was dating him.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.431
Ok, the other night you said
some things-

01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:11.133
I was a little shit.

01:01:11.235 --> 01:01:13.602
Yes, you were.

01:01:13.704 --> 01:01:16.171
But some of them
I needed to hear.

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:19.341
You already recognized that
you might not be right for Rob.

01:01:19.443 --> 01:01:21.910
Not what he wants.

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:24.246
By the way, total, total,
total madness.

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:25.247
Yeah.

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:27.149
You know, I...

01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:33.422
I really thought that Rob
was the guy.

01:01:33.524 --> 01:01:34.556
Now I kind of hate him.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:36.858
No you don't.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:37.926
Why?

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:40.328
Why shouldn't I be allowed
to hate him?

01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:46.068
I just want to hate him.

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:50.706
Hate gives him power
over you.

01:01:50.808 --> 01:01:54.910
Look, you don't have to forget.

01:01:55.012 --> 01:01:57.446
You shouldn't forget.

01:01:57.548 --> 01:01:59.347
But you can forgive.

01:02:01.151 --> 01:02:02.284
You know?

01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:03.318
Yeah.

01:02:04.488 --> 01:02:05.387
<i>I hope you two
like spicy sausage!</i>

01:02:06.457 --> 01:02:08.156
<i>I hate spicy sausage.</i>

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:09.825
Why does she always do this
to us?

01:02:14.865 --> 01:02:15.931
Alright.

01:02:16.033 --> 01:02:16.865
You would think she'd figure it
out by now.

01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:19.434
That's for you guys.

01:02:19.536 --> 01:02:21.603
I'll grab some napkins.

01:02:21.705 --> 01:02:24.206
Mmm.

01:02:24.308 --> 01:02:27.642
<i>And green peppers.</i>

01:02:27.745 --> 01:02:28.844
<i>It's like the worst.</i>

01:02:28.946 --> 01:02:30.045
<i>The worst pizza ever.</i>

01:02:30.147 --> 01:02:31.813
Um, I'd like green peppers
on my pizza,

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.215
so no one ever...

01:02:33.317 --> 01:02:34.516
No one.

01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:44.960
Ok, next one.

01:02:45.062 --> 01:02:45.660
Alright.

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:46.461
Let's go. I'm on a roll.

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:50.932
I knew you'd pick it.

01:02:51.034 --> 01:02:51.767
Wait, wait, wait.

01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:53.502
Here you go.

01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:55.337
Oh, sorry, I had to.

01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:56.471
This is...

01:02:56.573 --> 01:02:58.607
You... it was actually perfect.

01:02:58.709 --> 01:02:59.741
Are you serious?

01:02:59.843 --> 01:03:00.675
Ok, I just...

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:02.310
I can't believe you.

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:04.412
I thought he'd pick it.

01:03:04.515 --> 01:03:05.614
It was really funny!

01:03:05.716 --> 01:03:06.348
It was extremely funny.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:07.349
Wow.

01:03:10.988 --> 01:03:11.686
Atta girl.

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:12.821
That's the sixth time.

01:03:12.923 --> 01:03:13.722
Block him.

01:03:13.824 --> 01:03:16.057
If he doesn't stop I will.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.160
You're still wearing the ring.

01:03:18.262 --> 01:03:21.530
Oh, um... it's just 'til I give
it back to him at school.

01:03:21.632 --> 01:03:25.634
Or you could incinerate it
in the fires of Mount Doom?

01:03:25.736 --> 01:03:27.035
Thanks for the empathy.

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.604
On that note, we need snacks.

01:03:29.706 --> 01:03:30.906
Ooh, ooh, I want a muffin.

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:31.773
Sar?

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:32.874
Nah, I'm good.

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.810
Some of us can't eat constantly.

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:45.153
<i>What do you fell like?</i>

01:03:45.255 --> 01:03:47.222
<i>Uh, chips please.</i>

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:50.826
Chips?

01:03:50.928 --> 01:03:52.661
<i>And a coffee please.</i>

01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:03.972
Rob wants to see you.

01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:05.674
I'm sure he does.

01:04:05.776 --> 01:04:07.008
You're hardcore wrecking him

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:10.245
and yet for some reason
he won't shut up about you.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:12.814
Yeah, I can't even be mad
at you, Jacqueline.

01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:15.917
He's got you wrapped
around his little finger.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:17.118
Sarah!

01:04:17.221 --> 01:04:18.353
Wait!

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:19.187
Look, are you ok?

01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:20.255
Why haven't you been at school?

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:23.692
My mom wanted me to stay home.

01:04:23.794 --> 01:04:24.960
Did you tell her?

01:04:25.062 --> 01:04:26.661
I told her we broke up.

01:04:26.763 --> 01:04:27.863
I need to talk to you.

01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:28.697
In private.

01:04:28.799 --> 01:04:30.131
Just come for a drive with me.

01:04:30.234 --> 01:04:31.633
Zach's in the car,
he'll chaperone.

01:04:31.735 --> 01:04:33.535
What could you possibly
have to say?

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:34.903
I just-

01:04:35.005 --> 01:04:36.838
If she won't go for a drive
with you, Robbie, I will.

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:40.709
I bet I can take your mind
off things.

01:04:40.811 --> 01:04:42.143
What do you think, Sar?

01:04:42.246 --> 01:04:44.446
Jacqueline wants to go
for a drive with me.

01:04:48.719 --> 01:04:50.285
Fine.

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:52.454
You can drive me home.

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:53.255
We'll say goodbye.

01:04:53.357 --> 01:04:54.489
And then that's it.

01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:55.390
Ok?

01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:59.160
After this we... we move on.

01:04:59.263 --> 01:05:01.162
Let it all go.

01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:04.833
Agreed.

01:05:04.935 --> 01:05:06.501
I'll let it all go.

01:05:17.014 --> 01:05:18.346
Is-is that Jacqueline?

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:21.383
Is he ok?

01:05:21.485 --> 01:05:22.784
What's going on?

01:05:22.886 --> 01:05:25.820
He and Alexa broke up
and he's handling it poorly,

01:05:25.923 --> 01:05:28.223
so I'm keeping an eye on him.

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.279
I should text Nikki
you're driving me home.

01:05:51.381 --> 01:05:53.982
Oh, and how thrilled
will she be about that?

01:05:57.788 --> 01:05:58.486
Come on.

01:05:58.588 --> 01:05:59.754
Stop it!

01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:08.096
You took the wrong exit.

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:09.431
No I didn't.

01:06:09.533 --> 01:06:11.299
You said you were
driving me home.

01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:13.802
You said I was taking you home.

01:06:13.904 --> 01:06:15.937
I'm taking us for a drive.

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:34.456
Hey, Miss C.

01:06:34.558 --> 01:06:35.457
Hey.

01:06:35.559 --> 01:06:36.558
What're you doing here?

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.560
I came to get Sarah.

01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:40.562
I thought she was with you.

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:42.263
No.

01:06:46.203 --> 01:06:47.635
You were the last person
to see her yesterday,

01:06:47.738 --> 01:06:48.837
Jacqueline.

01:06:48.939 --> 01:06:51.339
You're positive she said
she was going home?

01:06:51.441 --> 01:06:53.441
That's where they said
they were going.

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:54.275
They?

01:06:54.378 --> 01:06:56.411
Yeah, she left with Rob.

01:07:01.785 --> 01:07:02.784
Sarah, ok, I'm not mad.

01:07:02.886 --> 01:07:04.219
Please just call me back, ok?

01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:05.787
I just need to know
that you're ok.

01:07:07.758 --> 01:07:09.357
Nikki, hey. Is she at school?

01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:11.559
<i>No, but one of her friends
saw her leave with Rob</i>

01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:12.961
<i>from the cafe.</i>

01:07:13.063 --> 01:07:14.929
Yeah, that's pretty
much what he told me.

01:07:15.032 --> 01:07:17.198
Him and Zach drove her home.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:18.633
<i>You've spoken to Rob?</i>

01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:19.534
He's here.

01:07:19.636 --> 01:07:21.002
I called him.

01:07:21.104 --> 01:07:23.171
He said that he dropped her
off here at 6:30, but Nikki,

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:24.205
something is wrong.

01:07:24.307 --> 01:07:25.640
It just feels wrong,
you know?

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:27.609
This isn't like her.

01:07:27.711 --> 01:07:28.777
She's not answering
her phone,

01:07:28.879 --> 01:07:30.945
she hasn't left a note,
this isn't like her.

01:07:31.048 --> 01:07:33.448
Miss C, there's something
I have to tell you

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.984
and I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner.

01:07:36.086 --> 01:07:39.354
Rob's not who you think he is.

01:07:39.456 --> 01:07:41.723
He hit Sarah at the dance.

01:07:41.825 --> 01:07:44.092
I saw it, Gus saw it.

01:07:44.194 --> 01:07:46.961
And he hit her once when
she visited him at home.

01:07:47.064 --> 01:07:51.032
<i>And she's got-she's got bruises
all over her body.</i>

01:07:51.134 --> 01:07:54.836
<i>I took pictures of them
and they're on her phone.</i>

01:07:54.938 --> 01:07:56.871
<i>She just-she didn't want me to
tell you and I'm really sorry,</i>

01:07:56.973 --> 01:07:58.239
<i>I should have told you.</i>

01:07:58.341 --> 01:07:59.774
<i>I should have told you.</i>

01:07:59.876 --> 01:08:04.946
Ok, um... you did
the right thing.

01:08:05.048 --> 01:08:06.781
I'll call you back.

01:08:16.093 --> 01:08:17.292
She's not at school?

01:08:17.394 --> 01:08:19.828
Uh...

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:21.496
Nikki asked around
and nobody has seen her.

01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:25.533
Rob, was she unhappy
when you left her?

01:08:25.635 --> 01:08:29.270
Actually she had mentioned that
she was feeling claustrophobic.

01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:32.974
That she needed a break
from school and... from Nikki.

01:08:33.076 --> 01:08:36.277
Right, so you think that
she may have run away?

01:08:36.379 --> 01:08:38.846
It's a possibility.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.148
Oh god.

01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:43.184
If you think it's something
she might have done...

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:45.120
I want you to leave.

01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:46.587
Why?

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:49.057
Nikki brought me up to date on
the nature of your relationship

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:50.658
with my daughter.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.394
Laura, I love Sarah
and Sarah loves me-

01:08:53.497 --> 01:08:54.362
So you never hit her?

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:55.430
No!

01:08:55.532 --> 01:08:57.265
You never threw her down
at your house?

01:08:57.367 --> 01:08:58.700
You never smacked her
at the dance?

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.702
If that's what Nikki's saying
then she's lying!

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:02.403
I would never hurt Sarah-

01:09:02.506 --> 01:09:04.439
Don't you dare twist this
around on Nikki!

01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:06.040
Don't do it!

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:09.944
Rob.

01:09:10.046 --> 01:09:12.779
Do you know where
my daughter is?

01:09:12.883 --> 01:09:13.915
No.

01:09:14.017 --> 01:09:14.849
I don't.

01:09:14.951 --> 01:09:17.385
Rob, do you know where she is?

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:18.752
No.

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:21.656
Then get out.

01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:24.826
Get out!

01:09:44.314 --> 01:09:46.314
Was Sarah happy?

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:50.285
Tell him what you told me.

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:57.892
Um... her boyfriend--
ex-boyfriend-- Rob Tennison,

01:09:57.994 --> 01:09:59.794
he was violent.

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:02.864
He hit her.

01:10:02.966 --> 01:10:07.235
He got angry at her a lot.

01:10:07.337 --> 01:10:10.171
Miss Collins, were you aware
of Rob's alleged behaviour?

01:10:10.273 --> 01:10:12.140
No, Nikki just told me.

01:10:12.242 --> 01:10:14.475
So she did keep secrets.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.046
We'll confirm Mr. Tennison's
whereabouts

01:10:18.148 --> 01:10:20.882
but in these types of cases
the missing teen

01:10:20.984 --> 01:10:23.284
has often run away of
their own accord.

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:26.321
We will reach out to his family
and take a statement.

01:10:26.423 --> 01:10:28.756
So what're we supposed to do?

01:10:28.858 --> 01:10:30.191
Let us do our jobs.

01:10:30.293 --> 01:10:32.060
You know, make calls,

01:10:32.162 --> 01:10:35.129
check in with family or anyone
she might visit.

01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:36.664
Be patient.

01:10:36.766 --> 01:10:38.766
Can you do that?

01:10:38.868 --> 01:10:40.802
No, I don't think we can.

01:10:42.806 --> 01:10:44.105
He's here.

01:10:54.985 --> 01:10:55.950
You wanna tell us why

01:10:56.052 --> 01:10:57.085
you've been skipping school,
man?

01:10:57.187 --> 01:10:58.486
Look, I don't see why you care.

01:10:59.823 --> 01:11:01.055
Hey!

01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:07.629
You were one of the last
people to see Sarah, Zach.

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:10.565
I already gave my statement
to the police.

01:11:10.667 --> 01:11:11.866
Ok? We dropped her off at home.

01:11:11.968 --> 01:11:13.234
Except you didn't.

01:11:15.372 --> 01:11:16.471
Look, I was wasted.

01:11:16.573 --> 01:11:17.805
I barely remember anything

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:19.874
Well, you remember enough
to freak you out.

01:11:19.976 --> 01:11:21.376
Make you avoid school.

01:11:21.478 --> 01:11:23.544
Look, it was all a blur.

01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:25.813
I thought Sarah was with us
in the car when we drove

01:11:25.915 --> 01:11:27.382
to the lake house
but I passed out

01:11:27.484 --> 01:11:29.450
and when I came to,
she wasn't.

01:11:29.552 --> 01:11:30.985
Rob told me that we dropped her
off at home

01:11:31.087 --> 01:11:34.455
before we even drove
out there, man.

01:11:34.557 --> 01:11:37.792
But you don't believe him.

01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:42.597
Her purse and phone were still
on the front seat of the car.

01:11:42.699 --> 01:11:44.699
Look, I swear, I thought
he just ditched her,

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:46.901
you know, to teach her a lesson
or something, you know?

01:11:47.003 --> 01:11:48.436
You need to tell the police.

01:11:48.538 --> 01:11:49.270
No, are you crazy?

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:50.271
He's going to kill me!

01:11:50.373 --> 01:11:52.840
Zach! Please.

01:11:55.979 --> 01:11:58.413
She started doing her own
laundry and I thought...

01:12:01.785 --> 01:12:06.187
I thought hey, she's growing up.

01:12:06.289 --> 01:12:10.758
But uh... no, she just didn't
want me to see the blood

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:12.460
and I should have.

01:13:29.472 --> 01:13:31.105
Nikki, where are you?

01:13:44.154 --> 01:13:45.086
Sarah?

01:13:46.256 --> 01:13:47.188
Sarah!

01:13:48.892 --> 01:13:50.358
Sarah!

01:13:51.728 --> 01:13:53.094
Sarah?

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:01.436
Sarah!

01:14:09.179 --> 01:14:10.144
Sarah!

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.152
Laura.

01:14:22.759 --> 01:14:24.725
Don't touch it.

01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:27.395
She was wearing
that at the cafe.

01:14:27.497 --> 01:14:29.530
I got pissed at her
for wearing it.

01:14:55.592 --> 01:14:57.191
Sarah.

01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:02.897
Sarah.

01:15:11.875 --> 01:15:12.773
u can't do this!

01:15:12.876 --> 01:15:14.141
Robert Tennison.

01:15:14.244 --> 01:15:16.444
You are under arrest for
the murder of Sarah Collins.

01:15:16.546 --> 01:15:18.946
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:15:19.048 --> 01:15:21.115
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:23.050
in a court of law.

01:15:23.152 --> 01:15:24.285
You have the right to
an attorney.

01:15:24.387 --> 01:15:26.754
Do you understand the rights
just read to you?

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:27.588
Excuse me!

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:29.023
Excuse me!

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:33.528
Sweetheart, sweetheart,
we'll get a lawyer, alright?

01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:36.163
All rise.

01:15:43.573 --> 01:15:45.139
Please be seated.

01:15:50.513 --> 01:15:53.915
Originally, Mr. Cahill,
you supported Rob's statement.

01:15:54.017 --> 01:15:56.384
That you dropped Sarah off
at her house, correct?

01:15:56.486 --> 01:15:57.552
Yeah.

01:15:57.654 --> 01:16:00.221
Y- yes, but I was scared
and I was confused.

01:16:00.323 --> 01:16:02.223
Just for the record, Mr. Cahill,

01:16:02.325 --> 01:16:04.258
<i>were you drunk on the night
in question?</i>

01:16:06.563 --> 01:16:07.295
Yeah.

01:16:07.397 --> 01:16:08.362
Yes, ma'am.

01:16:08.464 --> 01:16:11.132
Did you pass out at any point?

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:16.037
<i>Long enough, say, to have missed
seeing Sarah exiting Rob's car?</i>

01:16:16.139 --> 01:16:19.774
<i>Yes, but when I woke up I knew
something wasn't right.</i>

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:25.680
Yo.

01:16:25.782 --> 01:16:27.582
You're leaving your girl behind?

01:16:27.684 --> 01:16:28.649
What?

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:31.052
Sarah, isn't she coming with us?

01:16:31.154 --> 01:16:32.219
Dude, you're wasted.

01:16:32.322 --> 01:16:34.922
I dropped Sarah
off two hours ago.

01:16:37.126 --> 01:16:38.392
Uh, you got something
to say, Zach?

01:16:38.494 --> 01:16:40.328
Nothin', man.

01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:42.196
She just left her purse.

01:16:49.906 --> 01:16:53.307
He couldn't let her go.

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:55.910
Wouldn't let her go.

01:16:56.012 --> 01:16:58.713
<i>He couldn't let her go,
that's exactly right.</i>

01:16:58.815 --> 01:17:01.182
Rob Tennison was rejected
by Sarah Collins,

01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:03.117
but rather than give up,

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:05.152
<i>he drove her to a remote
location.</i>

01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:10.725
What're we doing here?

01:17:10.827 --> 01:17:12.793
I'm-I'm texting my mom
to come get me.

01:17:14.564 --> 01:17:16.797
Let's go take a walk.

01:17:16.899 --> 01:17:19.266
Rob, if you wanted to talk
you could have done so.

01:17:19.369 --> 01:17:22.503
In the car, while you were
driving me home as I asked.

01:17:22.605 --> 01:17:24.939
You remember
our weekends here?

01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:28.242
But they mean nothing now.

01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:29.243
Did you ever really love me?

01:17:29.345 --> 01:17:30.578
Yes.

01:17:33.016 --> 01:17:34.281
I really did.

01:17:39.188 --> 01:17:41.656
I thought you were the one.

01:17:41.758 --> 01:17:46.260
The one that I would be
with forever.

01:17:48.865 --> 01:17:49.864
Sarah, please.

01:17:49.966 --> 01:17:51.065
Let's try again.

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:52.433
I'll get help.

01:17:52.535 --> 01:17:53.334
I'll go to anger management
classes or something-

01:17:53.436 --> 01:17:54.468
No, Robbie.

01:17:59.609 --> 01:18:01.075
I'm sorry.

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:02.009
You're still wearing the ring.

01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:02.810
Um...

01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:03.978
That has to mean something.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.046
I- I was just waiting
for the right moment

01:18:05.148 --> 01:18:07.348
to give it back to you, so...

01:18:12.088 --> 01:18:15.022
You'll find love again.

01:18:15.124 --> 01:18:17.725
We both will.

01:18:17.827 --> 01:18:21.195
I- it can't just over like-
like it's nothing!

01:18:21.297 --> 01:18:24.031
Robbie, we're going in circles.

01:18:24.133 --> 01:18:26.067
It's time to go.

01:18:27.603 --> 01:18:29.070
How do I know you won't
spread lies about me?

01:18:29.172 --> 01:18:30.104
Huh?

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:30.571
You'll make people think
the wrong thing.

01:18:30.673 --> 01:18:32.006
Rob.

01:18:32.108 --> 01:18:34.375
You're hurting me again.

01:18:34.477 --> 01:18:36.577
I- I won't tell anyone,
I promise.

01:18:36.679 --> 01:18:39.413
You broke my heart.

01:18:39.515 --> 01:18:41.849
I don't wanna see you fall
in love with anyone else.

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:49.356
You promised to be mine.

01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:51.926
I can't let you go.

01:19:17.754 --> 01:19:20.254
No... no... no...

01:19:29.999 --> 01:19:33.868
I wish I told someone.

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:38.139
Even if it cost me
Sarah's friendship.

01:19:38.241 --> 01:19:40.741
She'd still be here if I had.

01:19:48.551 --> 01:19:51.685
Why would Sarah even get
in that car with him

01:19:51.788 --> 01:19:54.889
if she was so afraid?

01:19:54.991 --> 01:19:56.924
<i>Why didn't Miss Farrow
tell you?</i>

01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:01.028
Nikki?

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:02.997
Nikki Farrow, look at me
right now, ok?

01:20:03.099 --> 01:20:06.167
This is not your fault.

01:20:06.269 --> 01:20:07.368
It's not your fault.

01:20:07.436 --> 01:20:10.771
Don't let anybody
make you think that it is.

01:20:10.873 --> 01:20:12.273
Miss Collins, it was
never my inten-

01:20:12.375 --> 01:20:13.974
Ok, just look at him.

01:20:14.076 --> 01:20:18.846
I mean, you're
all looking at her.

01:20:18.948 --> 01:20:21.315
Well, I mean right now
you're-

01:20:21.417 --> 01:20:25.519
you're saying well, why didn't
she tell anyone?

01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:27.321
Why didn't she walk away?

01:20:27.423 --> 01:20:28.756
If she had she would
still be alive.

01:20:28.858 --> 01:20:30.891
You're looking at her
and you are blaming her.

01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:32.726
Stop doing that.

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:37.097
Look at him.

01:20:38.534 --> 01:20:40.134
Blame him.

01:21:01.157 --> 01:21:02.723
<i>Please be seated.</i>

01:21:08.931 --> 01:21:11.398
Rob Tennison.

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:14.568
In the murder of
Miss Sarah Collins

01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:17.838
I must find you guilty
of all charges.

01:21:27.416 --> 01:21:31.318
<i>Between the year 2001 and 2012</i>

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:37.458
we lost 6,488 souls in battles
fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.028
<i>But during that
same time period,</i>

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:51.639
11,766 women were killed,
but by their own partners.

01:21:51.741 --> 01:21:55.309
This is a war that we,
in this country,

01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:58.345
refuse to address.

01:21:58.447 --> 01:22:03.417
It has to stop because things
have gotten so dire

01:22:03.519 --> 01:22:06.353
that this is what a victory
looks like

01:22:06.455 --> 01:22:10.291
and I am sorry folks
but today was no victory.

01:22:15.231 --> 01:22:18.933
<i>This case should
not be closed,</i>

01:22:19.035 --> 01:22:22.069
<i>because when it comes
to domestic violence</i>

01:22:22.171 --> 01:22:27.174
<i>there needs to be change
on a cultural level</i>

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:32.980
<i>and that change needs to start
with each and every one of you.</i>

01:22:37.687 --> 01:22:41.355
<i>♪ I've never seen
this on your face, ♪</i>

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:44.591
