01:53.490 --> 01:59.288
Henslowe, do you know what happens
to a man who doesn’t pay his debts?

01:59.371 --> 02:02.249
His boots catch fire!

02:03.751 --> 02:05.711
Why do you howl...

02:05.753 --> 02:08.422
when it is I who am bitten?

02:08.506 --> 02:11.425
-What am I, Mr. Lambert?
-Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.

02:11.509 --> 02:13.427
How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?

02:13.511 --> 02:16.514
12 pounds, 1 schilling and 4 pence,
Mr. Fennyman, including interest.

02:16.514 --> 02:18.432
-Aaah! I can pay you!
-When?

02:18.474 --> 02:21.685
Two weeks! Three weeks at the most!
Oh, for pity’s sake!

02:21.769 --> 02:23.938
Take them out.

02:24.021 --> 02:25.940
Where will you find...

02:26.023 --> 02:27.983
16 pounds, 5 schillings and 9 pence...

02:28.025 --> 02:30.027
Including interest, in 3 weeks?

02:30.027 --> 02:32.780
-I have a wonderful new play.
-Put them back in.

02:32.821 --> 02:34.823
-It’s a comedy!
-Cut off his nose.

02:34.823 --> 02:37.743
It’s a new comedy
by William Shakespeare.

02:39.453 --> 02:41.455
-And his ears.
-And a share!

02:41.455 --> 02:43.707
We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!

02:45.376 --> 02:47.002
Partners?

02:50.881 --> 02:53.300
It’s a crowd-tickler.

02:53.384 --> 02:56.679
Mistaken identities.
Shipwreck. Pirate king.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.890
-A bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
-I think I've seen it.

02:59.890 --> 03:01.642
I didn’t like it.

03:01.684 --> 03:05.437
-But this time it is by Shakespeare.
-What’s it called?

03:05.521 --> 03:08.315
"Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate’s Daughter".

03:08.399 --> 03:10.484
Good title.

03:10.568 --> 03:13.988
A play takes time.
Find the actors, rehearsals.

03:13.988 --> 03:16.365
Let’s say we open in 2 weeks.

03:16.490 --> 03:18.993
That’s, what, 500 groundlings
at tuppence a head.

03:18.993 --> 03:22.663
In addition, 400 backsides at
three pence, a penny extra for cushions.

03:22.705 --> 03:24.665
Call it, uh, 200 cushions.

03:24.748 --> 03:28.586
Say two performances for safety.
How much is that, Mr. Frees?

03:28.586 --> 03:31.714
-20 pounds to the penny, Mr. Fennyman.
-Correct.

03:31.797 --> 03:34.925
-But I have to pay the actors and the author.
-Share of the profits.

03:34.925 --> 03:37.428
-There’s never any...
-Of course not.

03:39.013 --> 03:41.974
Mr. Fennyman, I think you
might have hit upon something.

03:42.016 --> 03:43.893
Sign there.

03:48.272 --> 03:51.859
So, "Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate’s Daughter".

03:52.818 --> 03:53.861
Almost finished?

03:53.861 --> 03:57.448
Without doubt he’s completing
it at this very moment.

04:34.735 --> 04:38.739
<b><u>Subtitles by ADONI@</u></b>

04:55.631 --> 04:58.592
Will. Will!

04:59.718 --> 05:01.178
Where is my play?

05:01.178 --> 05:04.515
Tell me you have it nearly done.
Tell me you have it started.

05:04.515 --> 05:07.977
<i>Doubt that the stars are fire,
doubt that the sun doth move.</i>

05:07.977 --> 05:10.771
No, no, we haven’t the time.
Talk prose.

05:10.813 --> 05:12.731
Where is my play?

05:12.815 --> 05:15.442
-It is all locked safe in here.
-God be praised.

05:15.442 --> 05:17.319
Locked?

05:17.403 --> 05:20.823
-As soon as I find my muse.
-Who is she this time?

05:20.823 --> 05:22.741
She is always Aphrodite.

05:22.825 --> 05:25.661
Aphrodite Baggot, who does it
behind the Dog and Trumpet?

05:25.661 --> 05:28.747
Henslowe, you have no soul...

05:28.831 --> 05:32.585
so how can you understand
the emptiness that seeks a soul mate?

05:32.585 --> 05:34.503
Ow! Will!

05:34.587 --> 05:37.506
I am a dead man and buggered to boot.

05:37.590 --> 05:40.092
My theater is closed by the plague
these twelve weeks.

05:40.134 --> 05:43.095
My actors are forced to tour
the inn yards of England...

05:43.095 --> 05:46.098
while Mr. Burbage and the Chamberlain’s
Men are invited to court...

05:46.098 --> 05:49.101
and receive 10 pounds
to play your piece...

05:49.101 --> 05:52.104
written for my theater,
by my writer, at my risk...

05:52.104 --> 05:54.106
when you were green and grateful.

05:54.106 --> 05:57.109
-What piece? "Richard Crookback"?
-No! It's comedy they want.

05:57.109 --> 05:59.028
Like "Romeo and Ethel".

05:59.111 --> 06:02.114
-Who wrote that?
-Nobody. You were writing it for me.

06:02.114 --> 06:05.117
-I gave you 3 pound a month since.
-Half what you owe me.

06:05.117 --> 06:07.536
I'm still due for
"One Gentleman of Verona".

06:07.536 --> 06:11.040
What is money to you and me?
I, your patron, you, my word Wright.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.958
When the plague lifts...

06:13.042 --> 06:16.045
Burbage will have a new play
by Christopher Marlowe for the "Curtain".

06:16.045 --> 06:18.047
-I will have nothing for the "Rose".
-Mr. Henslowe.

06:18.047 --> 06:20.716
-Will you lend me 50 pounds?
-50 pounds? What for?

06:20.758 --> 06:23.052
Burbage offers me a partnership
in the Chamberlain’s Men.

06:23.052 --> 06:27.014
For 50 pounds, my days
as a hired player are over.

06:27.056 --> 06:29.934
Oh, cut out my heart.
Throw my liver to the dogs.

06:30.017 --> 06:31.936
No, then?

06:32.019 --> 06:34.980
Theaters are handmaidens of the devil!

06:35.064 --> 06:39.693
The players breed lewdness in your wives
and wickedness in your children!

06:39.693 --> 06:44.281
And the "Rose" smells
thusly rank by any name!

06:44.365 --> 06:48.994
I say, a plague on both their houses!

06:49.078 --> 06:50.996
Where are you going?

06:51.080 --> 06:53.165
My weekly confession.

06:58.337 --> 07:01.257
Words, words, words.

07:01.340 --> 07:03.759
Once, I had the gift.

07:03.843 --> 07:07.847
I could make love out of words
as a potter makes cups of clay.

07:07.847 --> 07:09.849
Love that overthrows empires.

07:09.849 --> 07:13.352
Love that binds two hearts together,
come hellfire and brimstone.

07:13.352 --> 07:17.273
For sixpence a line,
I could cause a riot in a nunnery.

07:17.356 --> 07:20.776
-But now...
-And yet you tell me you lie with women.

07:22.444 --> 07:25.197
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe...

07:25.281 --> 07:29.410
Rosaline, Borage’s seamstress,
Aphrodite, who does it behind...

07:29.410 --> 07:32.204
Yes, now and again.
What of it?

07:32.329 --> 07:33.956
I have lost my gift.

07:33.998 --> 07:36.417
I am here to help you.

07:36.458 --> 07:38.919
Tell me, in your own words.

07:43.132 --> 07:46.510
It’s as if my quill is broken...

07:46.635 --> 07:50.514
as if the organ of my imagination
has dried up...

07:50.639 --> 07:54.268
as if the proud tower
of my genius has collapsed.

07:54.268 --> 07:55.853
Interesting.

07:55.895 --> 07:58.063
-Nothing comes.
-Most interesting.

07:58.147 --> 08:02.568
It’s like trying to pick a lock
with a wet herring.

08:02.651 --> 08:08.032
Tell me, are you lately humbled
in the act of love?

08:09.992 --> 08:11.785
How long has it been?

08:12.995 --> 08:16.040
A goodly length in times past,
but lately...

08:16.040 --> 08:19.460
No, no.
You have a wife, children?

08:22.171 --> 08:24.298
Aye.

08:25.424 --> 08:29.929
I was a lad of 18. Anne Hathaway
was a woman half as old again.

08:29.929 --> 08:32.973
-A woman of property?
-She had a cottage.

08:33.057 --> 08:36.435
One day she was 3 months
gone with child, so...

08:36.435 --> 08:37.853
And your relations?

08:37.895 --> 08:41.649
-On my mother’s side, the Ardens.
-No, your marriage bed.

08:41.649 --> 08:45.236
4 years and a 100 miles away
in Stratford.

08:45.319 --> 08:49.114
A cold bed, too,
since the twins were born.

08:49.198 --> 08:51.116
Banishment was a blessing.

08:51.200 --> 08:56.372
-So, now you are free to love...
-Yet cannot love, nor write it.

08:57.498 --> 09:01.335
Here is a... a bangle...

09:01.418 --> 09:04.922
found in Psyche’s temple
on Olympus.

09:05.005 --> 09:07.299
Cheap at 4 pence.

09:07.383 --> 09:12.304
Write your name on a paper
and feed it into the snake.

09:12.388 --> 09:14.390
Will it restore my gift?

09:14.390 --> 09:17.893
The woman who wears the snake will
dream of you, and your gift will return.

09:17.893 --> 09:21.105
Words will flow like a river.

09:21.188 --> 09:23.274
See you next week.

09:24.692 --> 09:27.736
-Now where?
-To the palace at Whitehall.

09:28.779 --> 09:31.115
All right.

09:33.284 --> 09:34.618
Hello, Will.

09:34.702 --> 09:37.746
Prithee, Mr. Kempe. Break a leg.

09:37.830 --> 09:41.709
-You too, good Crab.
-Crab’s nervous. He’s never played the palace.

09:41.709 --> 09:44.211
When will you write me
a tragedy, Will?

09:44.211 --> 09:47.631
-I could do it.
-No, they'd laugh at Seneca if you played it.

09:47.631 --> 09:50.968
There is no dog in the first scene,
Mr. Kempe, thank you.

09:50.968 --> 09:54.138
-How goes it, Will?
-I’m still owed money for this play...

09:54.180 --> 09:56.348
-Burbage.
-Not by me. I only stole it.

09:56.473 --> 09:58.976
My sleeve wants for a button,
Mistress Rosaline.

09:58.976 --> 10:01.395
Where were my seamstress' eyes?

10:01.478 --> 10:04.231
When are you coming over
to the Chamberlain’s Men?

10:04.231 --> 10:05.441
When I have £50.

10:05.441 --> 10:08.944
-You writing?
-A comedy. All but done.

10:09.069 --> 10:10.821
A pirate comedy.

10:10.863 --> 10:12.615
-Wonderful.
-Bring it tomorrow.

10:12.615 --> 10:15.034
-It’s for Henslowe. He paid me.
-How much?

10:15.075 --> 10:16.410
-£10.
-You’re a liar.

10:16.452 --> 10:20.289
He wants Romeo for Ned
and the Admiral’s Men.

10:20.289 --> 10:22.082
Mmm. Ned’s wrong for it.

10:22.082 --> 10:24.543
Will?

10:24.627 --> 10:27.880
Here’s 2 sovereigns. I'll give
you another 2 when I see the pages.

10:27.922 --> 10:29.965
-Done.
-Burbage, I will see you hanged...

10:29.965 --> 10:32.092
-for a pickpocket.
-The queen has commanded it.

10:32.092 --> 10:35.679
She loves a comedy. And
the Master of the Revels favours us.

10:35.804 --> 10:38.724
And what favour does Mr. Tilney
receive from you?

10:38.807 --> 10:40.684
-Ask him.
-She comes!

11:07.086 --> 11:09.547
<i>Cease to persuade,
my loving Proteus.</i>

11:09.547 --> 11:11.841
<i>Home-keeping youth
have ever homely wits,</i>

11:11.841 --> 11:15.845
<i>were it not affection
chains thy tender days...</i>

11:17.721 --> 11:20.182
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?

11:20.182 --> 11:23.727
-I’ve lost my gift.
-You left it in my bed.

11:23.727 --> 11:25.604
Come to look for it again.

11:31.527 --> 11:35.447
Are you to be my muse, Rosaline?

11:35.531 --> 11:38.617
Burbage has my keeping...

11:38.701 --> 11:40.786
but you have my heart.

11:43.330 --> 11:45.374
You see?
The consumptives plot against me.

11:45.374 --> 11:47.376
Will Shakespeare has a play.

11:47.376 --> 11:49.795
Let’s go and cough through it.

11:51.547 --> 11:54.884
<i>My father weeping,
my mother wailing...</i>

11:54.884 --> 11:59.638
<i>our maid howling,
our cat wringing her hands.</i>

11:59.722 --> 12:03.100
<i>Yet did not this coldhearted cur...</i>

12:03.184 --> 12:06.103
<i>shed one tear...</i>

12:19.158 --> 12:20.951
You see?
Comedy.

12:23.287 --> 12:27.166
Love, and a bit with a dog.
That’s what they want.

12:35.174 --> 12:39.094
<i>He is a stone, a very pebble stone,</i>

12:39.178 --> 12:43.182
<i>and has no more pity in him
than a dog!</i>

12:43.265 --> 12:46.268
<i>A Jew would have wept
to have seen our parting.</i>

12:46.268 --> 12:51.148
<i>Now the dog all this while
sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word...</i>

12:51.232 --> 12:53.734
Well played, Master Crab!

12:54.527 --> 12:57.863
I commend you!

13:00.783 --> 13:03.494
<i>What light is light...</i>

13:03.577 --> 13:06.038
<i>if Silvia be not seen?</i>

13:06.622 --> 13:09.208
<i>What joy is joy...</i>

13:09.291 --> 13:11.544
<i>if Silvia be not by?</i>

13:11.627 --> 13:14.547
<i>Unless it be to think that she is by...</i>

13:14.630 --> 13:18.551
<i>and feed upon the shadow of perfection.</i>

13:20.135 --> 13:23.055
<i>Except I be by Silvia
in the night,</i>

13:23.138 --> 13:26.600
<i>there is no music
in the nightingale.</i>

13:26.725 --> 13:29.603
<i>Unless I look on Silvia
in the day,</i>

13:29.687 --> 13:33.148
<i>there is no day for me to look upon.</i>

13:56.505 --> 14:00.134
Did you like Proteus
or Valentine best?

14:00.134 --> 14:03.137
Proteus for speaking.
Valentine for looks.

14:03.137 --> 14:05.639
Oh, I liked the dog for laughs.

14:05.639 --> 14:08.142
Silvia, I did not care for much.

14:08.142 --> 14:10.144
His fingers were red
from fighting...

14:10.144 --> 14:13.397
and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons.

14:13.480 --> 14:17.651
Stage love will never be true love
while the law of the land...

14:17.651 --> 14:21.614
has our heroines being played
by pipsqueak boys in petticoats.

14:21.614 --> 14:24.783
-Oh, when can we see another?
-When the queen commands it.

14:24.783 --> 14:26.702
No, but at the playhouse. Nurse!

14:26.785 --> 14:30.664
Be still. Playhouses are not
for wellborn ladies.

14:30.664 --> 14:32.917
Oh! I’m not so wellborn.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.503
Well-monied is the same
as wellborn,

14:35.503 --> 14:38.005
and well-married
is more so.

14:38.005 --> 14:40.424
Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.

14:40.508 --> 14:43.010
All the men at court
are without poetry.

14:43.010 --> 14:46.013
If they see me, they see
my father’s fortune.

14:46.013 --> 14:49.600
I will have poetry in my life...

14:49.683 --> 14:51.602
and adventure.

14:52.728 --> 14:55.397
And love.
Love above all.

14:55.481 --> 14:57.441
Like Valentine and Silvia?

14:57.483 --> 15:01.362
No, not the artful postures of love...

15:01.445 --> 15:05.449
but love that overthrows life.

15:05.533 --> 15:09.203
Unbiddable, ungovernable,
like a riot in the heart...

15:09.286 --> 15:13.707
and nothing to be done,
come ruin or rapture.

15:13.707 --> 15:17.378
Love as there has never been
in a play.

15:17.461 --> 15:21.382
I will have love,
or I will end my days as...

15:21.465 --> 15:23.384
As a nurse?

15:24.635 --> 15:28.264
Oh, but I would be
Valentine and Silvia too.

15:28.347 --> 15:32.601
Oh, good nurse,
God save you, and good night.

15:33.769 --> 15:36.689
I would stay asleep my whole life...

15:36.772 --> 15:40.693
if I could dream myself
into a company of players.

15:40.776 --> 15:43.821
Clean your teeth
while you dream, then.

15:46.657 --> 15:49.243
Now spit.

16:12.516 --> 16:16.020
This time the boots are coming off.

16:16.145 --> 16:17.438
What have I done?

16:17.521 --> 16:19.607
The theaters have all been
closed down by the plague.

16:19.607 --> 16:22.526
-Oh, that.
-By order of the Master of the Revels.

16:22.610 --> 16:27.031
Mr. Fennyman, allow me to explain
about the theater business.

16:27.031 --> 16:31.869
The natural condition is one of insurmountable
obstacles on the road to imminent disaster.

16:31.911 --> 16:33.787
-So what do we do?
-Nothing.

16:33.871 --> 16:36.665
Strangely enough,
it all turns out well.

16:36.707 --> 16:40.211
-How?
-I don’t know. It’s a mystery.

16:40.252 --> 16:42.630
Shall I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?

16:42.630 --> 16:44.507
The theaters are reopened...

16:44.632 --> 16:48.302
by order of the Master of the Revels!

16:48.385 --> 16:51.555
The theaters are reopened!

16:52.306 --> 16:56.018
Mr. Fennyman, Mr. Tilney
has reopened the playhouses.

16:56.143 --> 16:58.437
If you wouldn’t mind.

17:02.107 --> 17:05.986
-Where’s the play?
-Oh, it’s coming. It’s coming.

17:08.656 --> 17:10.533
It’s coming.

17:21.752 --> 17:23.629
Will!

17:23.754 --> 17:25.631
Will, I have wonderful news.

17:25.756 --> 17:27.758
So have I.
Romeo and Rosaline, scene one.

17:27.758 --> 17:29.635
God, I’m good!

17:29.760 --> 17:32.638
Rosaline?
You mean Ethel.

17:38.018 --> 17:39.770
Richard?

17:41.730 --> 17:43.482
Burbage!

17:49.864 --> 17:51.574
Mr. Tilney.

17:51.657 --> 17:55.327
Like you,
I found him not at home.

17:57.663 --> 18:00.541
I would’ve made you immortal.

18:03.419 --> 18:06.589
Tell Burbage he has lost
a new play by Will Shakespeare.

18:06.589 --> 18:09.258
What does Burbage care of that?

18:09.341 --> 18:13.095
He’s readying the "Curtain"
for Kit Marlowe.

18:13.179 --> 18:16.432
-You’ve opened the playhouses?
-I have, Master Shakespeare.

18:16.515 --> 18:19.518
-But the plague...
-Yes, I know...

18:19.602 --> 18:22.521
but he was always hanging around the house.

18:36.493 --> 18:40.122
The special today is a pig’s foot
marinated in juniper berry vinegar,

18:40.122 --> 18:42.082
served on a buckwheat pancake...

18:42.166 --> 18:47.171
-Will! Have you finished?
-Yes, nearly.

18:47.171 --> 18:49.924
Good morning, Master Nol.
You'll have a nice part.

18:49.924 --> 18:53.260
-Yes!
-We’ll need Ralph for the pirate king.

18:53.260 --> 18:55.554
Clear that bloody table!

18:55.554 --> 18:58.599
None other than the Admiral’s Men
are out on tour.

18:58.599 --> 19:00.768
I need actors!

19:00.851 --> 19:04.855
Those of you who are unknown
will have a chance to be known!

19:04.855 --> 19:10.152
-What about the money, Mr. Henslowe?
-It won’t cost you a penny! Ha ha ha!

19:10.194 --> 19:11.987
Auditions in half an hour!

19:17.493 --> 19:19.870
Ralph Bagswell,
I'd have a part for you...

19:19.870 --> 19:22.206
but, alas, I hear you are
a drunkard’s drunkard.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.416
Never when I’m working.

19:24.959 --> 19:27.127
Never when I’m working!

19:28.295 --> 19:32.424
-Get me to drink mandragora.
-Straight up, Will?

19:32.508 --> 19:35.803
Give my friend a beaker
of your best brandy.

19:36.053 --> 19:37.555
Kit.

19:37.888 --> 19:41.016
-How goes it, Will?
-Wonderful. Wonderful.

19:41.100 --> 19:45.229
-Burbage says you have a play.
-I have, and the chinks to show for it.

19:45.229 --> 19:47.982
I insist.
A beaker for Mr. Marlowe.

19:48.983 --> 19:51.068
I hear you have a new play
for the "Curtain".

19:51.110 --> 19:53.237
Not new.
My "Doctor Faustus".

19:53.737 --> 19:56.031
Ah. I love your early work.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.784
<i>Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...</i>

19:58.784 --> 20:01.412
<i>and burnt the topless towers
of llium?"</i>

20:01.412 --> 20:04.415
I have a new one
nearly finished, and better.

20:04.415 --> 20:06.333
"The Massacre at Paris".

20:07.960 --> 20:11.213
-Good title.
-Yours?

20:11.297 --> 20:14.049
"Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate’s Daughter".

20:16.135 --> 20:19.722
-Yes, I know. I know.
-What is the story?

20:20.431 --> 20:22.850
Well, there’s this pirate...

20:25.477 --> 20:28.355
In truth,
I have not written a word.

20:29.064 --> 20:31.275
Romeo.

20:31.317 --> 20:34.361
Romeo is Italian...

20:34.445 --> 20:36.697
always in and out of love.

20:36.780 --> 20:39.074
Yes, that’s good.
Until he meets...

20:39.074 --> 20:41.410
-Ethel.
-Do you think?

20:41.493 --> 20:44.038
-The daughter of his enemy.
-The daughter of his enemy.

20:44.038 --> 20:46.332
His best friend
is killed in a duel...

20:46.332 --> 20:49.919
by Ethel’s brother, or something.
His name is Mercutio.

20:49.919 --> 20:51.837
Mercutio.
Good name.

20:51.921 --> 20:55.341
-Will! They’re waiting for you!
-Yes, I’m coming.

20:55.424 --> 20:58.177
Good luck with yours, Kit.

20:58.260 --> 21:01.055
I thought your play
was for Burbage.

21:01.055 --> 21:04.266
-This is a different one.
-A different one you haven’t written?

21:05.017 --> 21:06.727
<i>Was this the face...</i>

21:06.810 --> 21:09.355
<i>that launched a thousand ships...</i>

21:09.355 --> 21:11.857
<i>and burnt the topless
towers of llium?</i>

21:11.857 --> 21:13.442
Thank you!

21:13.526 --> 21:16.195
<i>Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...</i>

21:16.195 --> 21:17.571
<i>And burnt the top-</i>

21:17.613 --> 21:18.989
Thank you!

21:18.989 --> 21:20.991
<i>Was this the face...</i>

21:20.991 --> 21:24.662
<i>that launched a thousand ships
and burnt the topless towers...</i>

21:24.662 --> 21:27.456
I would like to give you something
from Faustus...

21:27.456 --> 21:29.834
-by Christopher Marlowe.
-How refreshing.

21:29.834 --> 21:31.627
<i>...the topless towers of llium?</i>

21:31.627 --> 21:34.755
<i>Sweet Helen,
make me immortal with a kiss.</i>

21:38.133 --> 21:40.052
<i>W- W- Was this the f...</i>

21:40.135 --> 21:43.722
Very good, Mr. Wabash.
Report to the property master.

21:44.890 --> 21:47.977
My tailor wants to be an actor.

21:48.018 --> 21:51.814
I have a few debts here and there.
Well, that seems to be everybody.

21:52.189 --> 21:54.275
-Did you see a "Romeo"?
-I did not.

21:54.316 --> 21:57.027
Well, I to my work,
you to yours.

21:57.027 --> 21:59.989
Oh, God.

22:04.952 --> 22:07.329
May I begin, sir?

22:07.955 --> 22:11.208
-Your name?
-Thomas Kent.

22:11.292 --> 22:14.461
I would like to do a speech
by a writer...

22:14.461 --> 22:16.881
who commands the heart of every player.

22:18.841 --> 22:24.013
<i>What light is light...</i>

22:24.096 --> 22:27.057
<i>if Silvia be not seen?</i>

22:28.100 --> 22:32.688
<i>What joy is joy
if Silvia be not by?</i>

22:33.772 --> 22:40.196
<i>Unless it be to think that she is by
and feed upon the shadow of perfection.</i>

22:41.614 --> 22:46.577
<i>Except I be by Silvia
in the night...</i>

22:47.119 --> 22:50.497
<i>there is no music
in the nightingale.</i>

22:51.040 --> 22:55.044
<i>Unless I look on Silvia
in the day...</i>

22:55.127 --> 22:59.006
<i>there is no day
for me to look upon.</i>

22:59.798 --> 23:04.970
<i>She is my essence,
and I leave to be if I be not...</i>

23:04.970 --> 23:07.806
-Take off your hat!
-My hat?

23:08.974 --> 23:10.684
Where’d you learn how to do that?

23:10.851 --> 23:13.103
-I...
-Let me see you. Take off your hat.

23:13.103 --> 23:17.566
-Are you M-Master Shakespeare?
-Wait there. Wait there!

23:30.454 --> 23:34.041
-Will, w-where are the pages?
-Where is the boy?

23:37.086 --> 23:40.130
B- B- B- Break a leg!

23:43.843 --> 23:46.762
Sir, will you buy my sweet orange?

24:05.573 --> 24:06.866
Hey!

24:24.884 --> 24:27.303
Everybody ready? All away!

24:28.554 --> 24:31.849
-Follow that boat!
-Right you are, governor.

24:36.979 --> 24:39.982
I know your face.
Are you an actor?

24:40.065 --> 24:43.444
-Yes.
-Yes, I think I’ve seen you in something.

24:43.444 --> 24:46.405
-That one about a king.
-Really?

24:46.530 --> 24:50.075
I had that Christopher Marlowe
in my boat once.

25:01.795 --> 25:05.508
-Do you know that house?
-Sir Robert De Lesseps.

25:15.768 --> 25:19.647
Where is she?
Our guests are upon us!

25:19.688 --> 25:23.567
Lord Wessex, too,
bargaining for a bride.

25:23.651 --> 25:26.654
My husband will have it settled tonight.

25:26.737 --> 25:29.281
Stamped, sealed
and celebrated.

25:29.281 --> 25:32.493
Tomorrow he drags me off to the country...

25:32.576 --> 25:37.456
and it will be three weeks gone
before we return from our estates.

25:38.332 --> 25:40.751
God save you, Mother.

25:40.835 --> 25:43.754
Hot water, Nurse.

25:47.007 --> 25:48.843
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

25:48.843 --> 25:50.803
-Who, sir?
-The actor.

25:50.845 --> 25:53.264
-Who asks for him?
-Will Shakespeare.

25:53.264 --> 25:56.392
Poet, playwright of the "Rose".

25:56.475 --> 25:57.768
Master Kent...

25:57.852 --> 26:00.938
is my nephew.

26:01.021 --> 26:02.940
I will wait.

26:03.023 --> 26:05.442
Much good may it do you.

26:08.863 --> 26:11.115
<i>"Romeo Montague...</i>

26:11.198 --> 26:13.158
<i>a Young Man of Verona".</i>

26:13.200 --> 26:15.119
Verona again?

26:15.202 --> 26:17.204
<i>"A comedy of quarreling families...</i>

26:17.204 --> 26:19.540
<i>"reconciled in the discovery
of Romeo...</i>

26:19.540 --> 26:22.042
<i>"to be the very same Capulet cousin...</i>

26:22.042 --> 26:25.921
<i>"stolen from the cradle and fostered
to manhood by his Montague mother...</i>

26:25.921 --> 26:30.384
<i>"that was robbed of her own child
by the pirate king".</i>

26:30.467 --> 26:32.469
Your mother and your father...

26:32.469 --> 26:35.472
From tomorrow,
away in the country for three weeks!

26:36.682 --> 26:38.809
Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?

26:38.809 --> 26:41.437
-He looks well enough for a charlatan.
-Oh, Nurse!

26:41.478 --> 26:44.899
He would give Thomas Kent the life
of Viola De Lesseps' dreaming.

26:44.982 --> 26:47.484
My lady, when your parents return,
I will tell.

26:47.484 --> 26:49.403
You will not tell.

26:49.486 --> 26:51.822
As I love you and you love me...

26:51.822 --> 26:56.202
you will bind my breast
and buy me a boy’s wig.

27:01.498 --> 27:04.960
- Master Plum. What business here?
-The 5 schilling business, Will.

27:04.960 --> 27:07.129
We play for the dancing.

27:26.357 --> 27:29.860
-I seek Master Thomas Kent.
-Musicians don’t eat.

27:30.027 --> 27:32.112
Sir Robert’s orders.

27:32.321 --> 27:34.907
She’s a beauty, my lord,
as would take...

27:34.907 --> 27:37.493
a king to church
for the dowry of a nutmeg.

27:37.535 --> 27:41.372
My plantations in Virginia
are not mortgaged for a nutmeg.

27:41.455 --> 27:44.041
I have an ancient name
which will bring you preferment...

27:44.041 --> 27:46.043
when your grandson is a Wessex.

27:46.043 --> 27:48.379
-Is she fertile?
-Oh, she will breed.

27:48.379 --> 27:52.550
-If she do not, send her back.
-Is she obedient?

27:52.591 --> 27:56.262
As any mule in Christendom.
But if you are the man to ride her...

27:56.345 --> 27:59.431
there are rubies in the saddlebag.

27:59.849 --> 28:01.642
I like her.

28:21.537 --> 28:25.708
By all the stars in heaven.
Who is she?

28:25.791 --> 28:29.253
Viola De Lesseps?
Dream on, Will.

29:07.666 --> 29:09.835
Master Shakespeare.

29:16.592 --> 29:19.512
-My lady Viola.
-My lord.

29:19.970 --> 29:22.348
I have spoken with your father.

29:22.473 --> 29:25.809
So, my lord?
I speak with him every day.

29:43.285 --> 29:45.079
Good sir.

29:46.247 --> 29:48.832
I heard you were a poet.

29:52.086 --> 29:54.463
A poet of no words?

29:59.927 --> 30:01.679
Poet?

30:02.096 --> 30:06.058
I was a poet till now, but I’ve seen
beauty that puts...

30:06.058 --> 30:09.979
my poems at one with
the talking ravens in the Tower.

30:10.020 --> 30:12.898
-How do I offend, my lord?
-By coveting my property.

30:12.898 --> 30:15.734
I cannot shed blood in her house,
but I will cut your throat...

30:15.776 --> 30:18.153
anon.
Do you have a name?

30:18.529 --> 30:21.031
Christopher Marlowe,
at your service.

30:45.264 --> 30:47.558
Romeo! Romeo!

30:47.641 --> 30:50.561
A Young Man of Verona.

30:50.644 --> 30:53.397
A comedy by William Shakespeare.

30:53.480 --> 30:56.567
-My lady!
-Who is there?

30:57.651 --> 31:00.070
-Will Shakespeare.
-Madam!

31:00.863 --> 31:03.324
Anon, good nurse,
anon.

31:03.824 --> 31:07.786
-Master Shakespeare?
-The same, alas.

31:07.828 --> 31:10.539
-But why alas?
-A lowly player.

31:10.581 --> 31:14.418
Alas, indeed, for I thought you
the highest poet of my esteem...

31:14.418 --> 31:17.171
and a writer of plays
that capture my heart.

31:17.171 --> 31:19.590
-I am him too.
-Madam!

31:19.673 --> 31:22.593
Anon!
I will come again.

31:24.178 --> 31:27.806
Oh, I am fortune’s fool.
I will be punished for this.

31:30.643 --> 31:32.561
Oh, my lady, my love!

31:33.604 --> 31:35.731
If they find you here, they will kill you.

31:35.773 --> 31:39.610
-You can bring them with a word.
-Oh, not for the world.

31:39.610 --> 31:42.780
-Madam!
-Anon!

32:41.881 --> 32:43.799
<i>Draw, if you be men!</i>

32:43.841 --> 32:45.926
<i>Gregory,
remember thy swashing blow!</i>

32:45.968 --> 32:49.388
<i>Part, fools! Put up your swords.
You know not what you do.</i>

32:49.388 --> 32:52.391
It starts well, then it’s all long-faced
about some Rosaline.

32:52.433 --> 32:55.352
Where’s the comedy, Will?
Where’s the dog?

32:55.352 --> 32:56.854
Do you think it’s funny?

32:56.896 --> 33:00.357
I was a pirate king, now I’m a nurse.
That’s funny.

33:00.399 --> 33:03.402
We are 6 men short, and those we
have will be over parted ranters...

33:03.402 --> 33:05.529
and stutterers who should be
sent back to the stews.

33:05.613 --> 33:07.823
My Romeo’s let me down.
I see disaster.

33:07.823 --> 33:10.451
We are 4 acts short,
if you’re looking for disaster.

33:10.451 --> 33:13.287
-Sir!
-Who are you, master?

33:13.537 --> 33:16.123
I’m Ethel, sir, the pirate’s daughter.

33:16.707 --> 33:19.168
I'll be damned if you are!

33:20.836 --> 33:22.588
Your attention, please!

33:22.630 --> 33:26.050
-Gentlemen, thank you!
-You are welcome.

33:26.133 --> 33:28.802
-Who’s that?
-Nobody. He’s the author.

33:28.802 --> 33:31.889
We are about to embark on a great voyage.

33:31.972 --> 33:35.434
It is customary to make a little speech
on the first day.

33:35.476 --> 33:37.978
It does no harm.
Authors like it.

33:37.978 --> 33:41.398
You want to know what parts you are
to receive. All will be settled as we...

33:41.398 --> 33:43.317
I’ll do it.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.819
Now listen to me, you dregs.

33:45.903 --> 33:47.905
Actors are 10 a penny...

33:47.905 --> 33:52.326
and I, Hugh Fennyman,
hold your nuts in my hand.

33:52.535 --> 33:53.994
Huzzah!

33:54.078 --> 33:57.665
The Admiral’s Men
are returned to the house!

33:57.748 --> 33:59.750
Huzzah!

34:00.709 --> 34:01.794
Ned!

34:03.170 --> 34:06.090
Henslowe!

34:06.173 --> 34:08.092
Earl! Good to see you.

34:12.304 --> 34:13.681
Who is this?

34:13.764 --> 34:16.225
Silence, you dog!

34:17.226 --> 34:19.228
I am "Hieronimo".

34:19.854 --> 34:23.607
I am "Tamburlaine".
I am "Faustus".

34:23.649 --> 34:28.445
I am "Barabbas",
the Jew of Malta.

34:30.072 --> 34:32.491
Oh, yes, Master Will.
I am "Henry the 6th".

34:33.158 --> 34:36.537
What is the play,
and what is my part?

34:36.620 --> 34:39.081
-Uh, one moment, sir...
-Who are you?

34:40.124 --> 34:43.919
I’m, um... I’m the money.

34:43.919 --> 34:47.131
Then you may remain,
so long as you remain silent.

34:47.214 --> 34:51.051
Pay attention. You will see
how genius creates a legend.

34:51.093 --> 34:53.512
-Thank you, sir.
-We are in desperate want...

34:53.512 --> 34:56.807
of a "Mercutio", Ned.
A young nobleman of Verona.

34:56.891 --> 34:58.893
-And the title of this piece?
-"Mercutio".

34:58.893 --> 35:00.227
Is it?

35:01.562 --> 35:03.480
I will play him.

35:05.191 --> 35:08.110
Mr. Pope. Mr. Philips.
Welcome.

35:08.194 --> 35:10.154
George Bryan.
James Armitage.

35:10.154 --> 35:12.406
Sam, my pretty one!

35:12.990 --> 35:16.160
-Are you ready to fall in love again?
-I am, Master Shakespeare.

35:16.243 --> 35:18.454
Your voice.
Have they dropped?

35:18.537 --> 35:20.915
No! No.
A touch of cold only.

35:21.040 --> 35:25.753
Master Henslowe, you have your actors,
except Thomas Kent.

35:25.836 --> 35:28.297
I saw his "Tamburlaine", you know.

35:28.380 --> 35:30.382
-It was wonderful.
-Yes, I saw it.

35:30.382 --> 35:32.384
Of course, such mighty writing.

35:32.384 --> 35:35.054
There’s no one like Marlowe.

35:48.609 --> 35:50.611
Better fortune, boy.

35:50.611 --> 35:52.154
I was in a play.

35:52.446 --> 35:55.574
They cut my head off
in "Titus Andronicus".

35:55.616 --> 35:58.661
When I write plays,
they’ll be like "Titus".

35:58.744 --> 36:00.204
You admire it.

36:00.287 --> 36:02.456
I liked it when they cut heads off,

36:02.456 --> 36:05.376
and the daughter mutilated with knives.

36:05.459 --> 36:08.254
-What’s your name?
-John Webster.

36:08.671 --> 36:09.630
Here, kitty, kitty.

36:14.552 --> 36:16.303
Plenty of blood.

36:16.387 --> 36:18.264
That’s the only writing.

36:19.431 --> 36:21.767
I have to get back.

36:21.809 --> 36:24.812
<i>See, where he comes.
So please you step aside.</i>

36:24.854 --> 36:27.022
<i>I’ll know his grievance,
or be much denied.</i>

36:27.064 --> 36:30.651
<i>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
to hear true shrift. Come, madam.</i>

36:30.693 --> 36:31.986
Cut around him for now.

36:31.986 --> 36:33.362
-What? Who?
-Romeo.

36:33.362 --> 36:35.364
-The one who came with your letter.
-What?

36:35.364 --> 36:36.991
<i>Good morrow, cousin.</i>

36:37.032 --> 36:40.619
<i>-Is the day so young?
-But new struck nine.</i>

36:40.703 --> 36:42.872
<i>Ay me.
Sad hours seem long.</i>

36:42.913 --> 36:45.416
<i>What sadness
lengthens Romeo’s hours?</i>

36:45.457 --> 36:48.252
<i>Not having that which having
makes them short.</i>

36:48.294 --> 36:49.128
Good!

36:49.170 --> 36:50.754
<i>-In love?
-Out.</i>

36:50.754 --> 36:54.633
<i>-Of love?
-Out of her favour where I am in love.</i>

36:54.675 --> 36:57.344
No, no, don’t spend it all at once.

36:58.429 --> 37:00.181
Yes, sir.

37:00.222 --> 37:02.933
-Do you understand me?
-No, sir.

37:03.767 --> 37:06.353
You’re speaking about
a baggage we never even meet.

37:06.353 --> 37:09.690
What will be left in his purse
when he meets his Juliet?

37:09.690 --> 37:11.775
-Juliet? You mean Ethel.
-God’s teeth!

37:11.775 --> 37:15.196
Am I to suffer this constant stream
of interruption?

37:16.780 --> 37:21.952
What will he do in Act Two,
when he meets the love of his life?

37:21.952 --> 37:26.207
I’m very sorry, sir.
I have not seen Act Two.

37:27.333 --> 37:31.378
Of course you have not.
I have not written it. Go once more.

37:32.546 --> 37:35.716
Will.
Where is Mercutio?

37:35.799 --> 37:38.802
Locked safe in here. I’ll leave
the scene in your safekeeping, Ned.

37:38.802 --> 37:40.721
I have a sonnet to write.

37:40.804 --> 37:42.890
Sonnet?
You mean a play!

37:47.061 --> 37:52.775
<i>" For Lady Viola De Lesseps,
by the hand of Thomas Kent.</i>

37:53.526 --> 37:57.071
<i>" Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</i>

37:57.112 --> 38:00.491
<i>" Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.</i>

38:02.493 --> 38:05.538
<i>" Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May... "</i>

38:05.579 --> 38:07.581
Two hours at prayer!

38:07.665 --> 38:11.710
-Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
-Piety is for Sunday!

38:11.752 --> 38:14.839
And 2 hours of prayer is not piety,
it is self-importance.

38:14.880 --> 38:17.341
It would be better that you return
tomorrow, my lord.

38:17.341 --> 38:20.177
It would be better if you’d tell her
to get off her knees and show...

38:20.219 --> 38:23.305
some civility to her 6day
lord and master!

38:26.141 --> 38:27.226
Mmmph!

38:33.399 --> 38:34.859
My lady Viola.

38:34.942 --> 38:38.237
Lord Wessex.
You’ve been waiting.

38:38.237 --> 38:39.363
I am aware of it.

38:40.614 --> 38:42.992
But it is beauty’s privilege.

38:43.284 --> 38:44.702
You flatter, my lord.

38:44.785 --> 38:48.539
No. I have spoken to the queen.

38:49.039 --> 38:52.626
Her Majesty’s consent is requisite
when a Wessex takes a wife...

38:52.626 --> 38:54.420
and once given,
her consent is her command.

38:54.461 --> 38:56.964
Do you intend to marry, my lord?

38:57.047 --> 39:01.802
Your father should keep you better
informed. He has bought me for you.

39:02.595 --> 39:06.974
He returns from his estates to see us
married two weeks from Saturday.

39:06.974 --> 39:09.643
You are allowed to show your pleasure.

39:10.728 --> 39:13.647
But I do not love you, my lord.

39:13.731 --> 39:16.483
How your mind hops about.

39:16.567 --> 39:19.028
Your father was a shopkeeper.

39:19.028 --> 39:22.072
Your children will bear arms,
and I will recover my fortune.

39:22.072 --> 39:24.283
That is the only matter
under discussion today.

39:24.325 --> 39:25.910
You will like Virginia.

39:25.993 --> 39:28.579
-Virginia?
-Oh, yes.

39:28.662 --> 39:31.749
My fortune lies in my plantations.
The tobacco weed.

39:31.790 --> 39:35.461
I need 4,000 pounds to fit out a ship
and put my investments to work.

39:35.461 --> 39:38.380
I fancy tobacco has a future.

39:38.464 --> 39:41.425
We will not stay there long, 3-4 years.

39:43.052 --> 39:45.930
-But why me?
-It was your eyes.

39:47.223 --> 39:49.058
No, your lips.

39:59.610 --> 40:02.613
Will you defy your father
and your queen?

40:02.613 --> 40:04.615
The queen has consented?

40:04.615 --> 40:06.534
She wants to inspect you.

40:06.617 --> 40:09.203
At Greenwich, come Sunday.

40:09.286 --> 40:15.626
Be submissive, modest,
grateful and brief.

40:17.127 --> 40:20.214
I will do my duty, my lord.

40:24.802 --> 40:29.557
<i>"Master Will,
poet dearest to my heart...</i>

40:29.640 --> 40:33.561
<i>I beseech you
banish me from yours.</i>

40:33.644 --> 40:36.897
<i>I am to marry Lord Wessex.</i>

40:37.982 --> 40:40.401
<i>A daughter’s duty...</i>

40:40.484 --> 40:42.903
<i>and the queen’s command".</i>

41:04.091 --> 41:08.262
Gentlemen upstage, Ladies downstage.

41:10.222 --> 41:13.851
Gentlemen upstage, Ladies downstage.

41:13.934 --> 41:17.188
Are you a lady Mr. Kent?

41:17.271 --> 41:19.023
I’m very sorry, sir.

41:21.609 --> 41:24.528
We’re gonna have to do it again.

41:25.863 --> 41:28.282
You did not like the speech?

41:28.365 --> 41:30.367
No, the speech is excellent.

41:30.367 --> 41:34.038
<i>Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you.</i>

41:34.121 --> 41:36.373
Excellent and a good length.

41:36.457 --> 41:40.836
But then he disappears
for the length of a bible.

41:42.004 --> 41:44.215
There. You have this duel.

41:44.298 --> 41:48.177
A skirmish of words and swords
such as I never wrote, nor anyone.

41:48.177 --> 41:53.224
He dies with such passion
and poetry as you ever heard.

41:53.307 --> 41:56.060
<i>A plague on both your houses!</i>

42:01.607 --> 42:03.442
He dies?

42:06.529 --> 42:08.989
-Ohh!
-Will!

42:09.114 --> 42:11.075
Where are my pages?

42:23.295 --> 42:25.256
Did you give her my letter?

42:26.549 --> 42:29.093
And this is for you!

42:42.022 --> 42:45.276
Oh, Thomas, she has cut my strings.

42:46.735 --> 42:48.612
I’m unmanned...

42:48.737 --> 42:51.824
unmended and unmade...

42:51.907 --> 42:53.784
like a puppet in a box.

42:53.909 --> 42:56.620
-Writer, is he?
-Row your boat!

42:56.829 --> 43:00.541
She tells me to keep away.
She is to marry Lord Wessex!

43:00.583 --> 43:02.001
What should I do?

43:02.251 --> 43:04.587
If you love her,
you must do as she asks.

43:04.628 --> 43:07.756
-And break her heart and mine?
-It is only yours you can know.

43:07.756 --> 43:11.177
-She loves me, Thomas!
-Does she say so?

43:11.177 --> 43:14.763
No, and yet she does where
the ink has run with tears.

43:14.763 --> 43:18.142
-Was she weeping when she gave you this?
-Uh...

43:18.267 --> 43:21.562
-Her letter came to me by the nurse.
-Your aunt.

43:21.687 --> 43:23.439
Yes, my aunt.

43:24.565 --> 43:26.942
But perhaps she wept a little.

43:29.236 --> 43:31.488
Tell me how you love her, Will.

43:31.572 --> 43:35.576
Like a sickness and its cure together.

43:36.327 --> 43:37.870
Oh, yes.

43:37.953 --> 43:40.331
Like rain and sun.

43:40.414 --> 43:43.000
Like cold and heat.

43:44.126 --> 43:46.545
Is your lady beautiful?

43:47.296 --> 43:51.592
Since I came here from the country,
I have not seen her close.

43:51.675 --> 43:54.595
Tell me, is...
is she beautiful?

43:54.678 --> 43:58.474
Thomas, if I could write
with the beauty of her eyes...

43:58.474 --> 44:02.520
I was born to look in them
and know myself.

44:03.938 --> 44:06.440
-A-A-And her lips?
-Her lips?

44:06.482 --> 44:10.861
The early morning rose would wither
on the branch if it could feel envy.

44:10.861 --> 44:13.614
And her voice,
like lark’s song?

44:13.614 --> 44:16.617
Deeper, softer.
None of your twittering larks.

44:16.617 --> 44:20.287
I would banish nightingales from her
garden before they interrupt her song.

44:20.287 --> 44:22.957
-Ah, she sings too?
-Constantly.

44:23.040 --> 44:26.502
Without doubt. And plays the lute.
She has a natural ear.

44:26.502 --> 44:28.546
And her bosom.

44:28.629 --> 44:32.675
-Did I mention her bosom?
-What of her bosom?

44:32.758 --> 44:35.386
Oh, Thomas, a pair of pippins...

44:35.386 --> 44:38.389
as round and rare
as golden apples.

44:38.430 --> 44:41.475
I think milady is wise
to keep your love at a distance.

44:41.475 --> 44:44.979
For what lady could live up
to it close to...

44:44.979 --> 44:47.857
when her eyes and lips and voice...

44:47.857 --> 44:50.860
may be no more beautiful than mine.

44:50.901 --> 44:54.405
Besides, can a... can a lady of wealth
and noble marriage...

44:54.405 --> 44:58.117
love happily with
a bank side poet and player?

44:58.117 --> 45:00.411
Yes, by God!

45:00.494 --> 45:03.330
Love knows nothing
of rank or riverbank.

45:03.330 --> 45:06.584
It will spark between a queen and
the poor vagabond who plays the king...

45:06.584 --> 45:09.086
an their love should be minded by each...

45:09.086 --> 45:11.839
for love denied blights
the soul we owe to God.

45:11.839 --> 45:14.925
So tell my lady William Shakespeare
waits for her in the garden.

45:14.925 --> 45:16.844
But what of Lord Wessex?

45:16.927 --> 45:20.347
For one kiss I would defy
a thousand Wessexes.

45:28.272 --> 45:30.274
Oh, Will.

45:31.358 --> 45:33.360
Thank you, my lady.

45:35.362 --> 45:36.864
Lady?

45:36.989 --> 45:40.367
Viola De Lesseps.
Known her since she was this high.

45:40.743 --> 45:43.204
Wouldn’t deceive a child.

45:44.663 --> 45:48.959
Strangely enough,
I’m a bit of a writer me self.

45:49.043 --> 45:51.712
It wouldn’t take you long to read it.

45:51.712 --> 45:54.423
I expect you’d know all the booksellers!

46:03.015 --> 46:05.017
Can you love a fool?

46:05.017 --> 46:07.811
Can you love a player?

46:15.736 --> 46:18.197
Wait!
You’re still a maid...

46:18.197 --> 46:21.408
and perhaps as mistook in me
as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.

46:21.408 --> 46:24.245
Are you the author of the plays
of William Shakespeare?

46:24.245 --> 46:25.829
I am.

46:25.913 --> 46:28.832
Then kiss me again,
for I am not mistook.

46:41.887 --> 46:44.807
I do not know how to undress a man.

46:44.890 --> 46:46.892
It is strange to me too.

48:00.799 --> 48:02.885
Go to.
Go to.

48:09.767 --> 48:11.977
I would not have thought it.

48:13.270 --> 48:16.190
There is something
better than a play.

48:16.273 --> 48:18.817
There is.

48:18.943 --> 48:21.320
Even your play.

48:23.447 --> 48:25.324
Oh?

48:26.659 --> 48:29.203
And that was only my first try.

48:45.761 --> 48:47.638
Will.

48:50.057 --> 48:52.434
You would not leave me.

48:52.560 --> 48:54.520
I must.

48:54.770 --> 48:56.772
Look how pale the window.

48:56.772 --> 48:58.649
Moonlight.

48:58.774 --> 49:01.610
Mmm, no.
The morning rooster woke me.

49:01.735 --> 49:04.822
It was the owl.
Come to bed.

49:06.907 --> 49:09.285
Oh, let Henslowe wait.

49:11.245 --> 49:13.122
Mr. Henslowe?

49:13.247 --> 49:15.666
Mmm, let him be damned for his pages.

49:15.749 --> 49:17.626
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

49:17.751 --> 49:20.629
There is time. Mmm!
It is still dark.

49:20.754 --> 49:23.716
-It’s broad day. The rooster tells us so.
-It was the owl.

49:23.757 --> 49:26.343
Believe me, love, it was the owl...

49:27.469 --> 49:30.890
You would leave us players
without a scene to read today?

49:34.768 --> 49:35.811
My lady?

49:35.936 --> 49:38.689
The house is stirring.
It is a new day.

49:39.773 --> 49:42.151
It is a new world.

49:42.276 --> 49:45.237
<i>Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much...</i>

49:45.279 --> 49:47.948
<i>which mannerly devotion
shows in this.</i>

49:47.948 --> 49:51.243
<i>For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch...</i>

49:51.243 --> 49:54.663
<i>and palm to palm
is holy palmers' kiss.</i>

49:54.747 --> 49:58.459
<i>Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?</i>

49:58.542 --> 50:00.461
<i>Aye, pilgrim.</i>

50:00.544 --> 50:02.963
<i>Lips that they must use
in prayer.</i>

50:03.047 --> 50:06.300
<i>Oh, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.</i>

50:06.300 --> 50:08.219
<i>They pray.</i>

50:08.302 --> 50:11.722
<i>Grant thou,
lest faith turn to despair.</i>

50:11.805 --> 50:15.226
<i>Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.</i>

50:16.936 --> 50:20.189
-It’s you.
-Suffering cats!

50:21.440 --> 50:26.654
<i>Then move not while
my prayer’s effect I take.</i>

50:30.991 --> 50:34.411
<i>Thus from my lips,
by thine my sin is purged.</i>

50:34.495 --> 50:37.331
<i>Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.</i>

50:37.331 --> 50:42.169
<i>Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.</i>

50:42.169 --> 50:44.797
Yes, yes!
Um, not quite right.

50:44.880 --> 50:46.882
It is more...
Let me.

50:46.966 --> 50:49.927
<i>Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.</i>

50:50.010 --> 50:55.057
<i>Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.</i>

51:00.771 --> 51:03.399
-You kiss by the book.
-Well, Will!

51:03.399 --> 51:05.484
It was lucky you were here.

51:05.568 --> 51:08.070
-Why do not I write the rest of your play...
-Yes, yes!

51:08.070 --> 51:12.283
Uh, continue. Now the nurse.
Where is Ralph?

51:12.575 --> 51:16.245
<i>Madam, your mother
craves a word with you.</i>

51:18.038 --> 51:20.875
<i>-What is her mother?
-Marry, bachelor,</i>

51:20.875 --> 51:23.544
<i>her mother is the lady of the house,
and a good lady...</i>

51:23.544 --> 51:25.754
<i>and a wise and virtuous.</i>

51:25.838 --> 51:28.841
<i>I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.</i>

51:28.841 --> 51:33.596
<i>I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
shall have the chinks.</i>

51:33.637 --> 51:35.764
<i>Is she a Capulet?</i>

51:35.848 --> 51:39.935
<i>Oh, dear account!
My life is my foe’s debt.</i>

51:39.935 --> 51:42.730
<i>Away. Be gone.
The sport is at the best.</i>

51:42.813 --> 51:45.900
<i>Aye, so I fear.
The more is my unrest.</i>

51:47.067 --> 51:50.321
<i>Come hither, nurse.
What is yon gentleman?</i>

51:50.404 --> 51:52.865
<i>The son and heir of old Tiberio.</i>

51:52.865 --> 51:55.201
Let it be night.

51:55.242 --> 51:58.746
<i>What’s he that follows
here that would not dance?</i>

51:58.746 --> 52:01.498
<i>-I know not.
-Go ask his name.</i>

52:02.917 --> 52:06.754
<i>If he be married, my grave is like
to be my wedding bed.</i>

52:08.422 --> 52:09.840
No, do not go.

52:09.924 --> 52:11.842
I must. I must.

52:11.926 --> 52:15.179
<i>-The only son of your great enemy.
-Terrible.</i>

52:15.262 --> 52:17.348
<i>Simply... terrible!</i>

52:23.771 --> 52:28.692
<i>But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?</i>

52:28.776 --> 52:33.572
<i>It is the east,
and Juliet is the sun.</i>

52:33.656 --> 52:38.202
<i>Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...</i>

52:38.285 --> 52:41.288
<i>who is already sick
and pale with grief...</i>

52:41.288 --> 52:45.835
<i>that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she".</i>

52:45.918 --> 52:48.671
-Oh, Will.
-Yes, some of it’s speak able.

52:48.712 --> 52:51.632
<i>It is my lady.
Oh, it is my love!</i>

52:51.632 --> 52:54.468
<i>Oh, that she knew she were!</i>

52:54.552 --> 52:58.138
<i>The brightness of her cheek
would shame those stars...</i>

52:58.222 --> 53:00.599
<i>as daylight doth a lamp".</i>

53:00.599 --> 53:03.811
<i>Her eyes in heaven would
through the airy region...</i>

53:03.811 --> 53:06.397
<i>stream so bright...</i>

53:06.480 --> 53:10.609
<i>that birds would sing
and think it were not night.</i>

53:10.651 --> 53:14.864
<i>See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.</i>

53:14.947 --> 53:17.867
<i>Oh, that I were a glove
upon that hand...</i>

53:17.950 --> 53:20.202
<i>that I might touch that cheek.</i>

53:20.286 --> 53:21.453
<i>Ay, me.</i>

53:21.579 --> 53:25.541
<i>Oh, Romeo, Romeo!</i>

53:25.624 --> 53:28.210
<i>Wherefore art thou, Romeo?</i>

53:28.294 --> 53:31.922
<i>-Deny thy father and...
-and refuse thy name.</i>

53:32.006 --> 53:34.925
<i>Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love...</i>

53:34.925 --> 53:37.678
<i>and I’ll no longer be a Capulet.</i>

53:37.761 --> 53:40.681
<i>Shall I hear more,
or shall I speak at this?</i>

53:41.849 --> 53:44.685
<i>What man art thou that
thus be screened in night...</i>

53:44.685 --> 53:47.396
<i>so stumblest on my counsel?"</i>

53:47.521 --> 53:50.774
<i>By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am.</i>

53:50.816 --> 53:55.571
<i>My name, dear saint, is hateful to
myself, because it is an enemy to thee.</i>

53:55.571 --> 53:59.033
<i>Had I it written
I would tear the word.</i>

53:59.116 --> 54:03.454
<i>The orchard walls are high
and hard to climb...</i>

54:03.537 --> 54:06.707
<i>and the place death,
considering who thou art...</i>

54:06.790 --> 54:09.460
<i>if any of my kinsmen find thee here.</i>

54:09.460 --> 54:12.505
<i>If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</i>

54:12.588 --> 54:17.092
<i>Alack, there lies more peril
in thine eye than 20 of their swords.</i>

54:17.092 --> 54:21.597
<i>Look thou but sweet,
and I am proof against their enmity.</i>

54:21.597 --> 54:23.974
<i>Would not for the world
they saw thee here.</i>

54:23.974 --> 54:26.977
<i>I have night’s cloak
to hide me from their eyes.</i>

54:26.977 --> 54:30.481
<i>-And but thou love me let them find me here.
-Good night.</i>

54:30.606 --> 54:32.525
<i>Good night...</i>

54:32.608 --> 54:35.569
<i>as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart...</i>

54:35.569 --> 54:37.947
<i>as that within my breast.</i>

54:38.030 --> 54:40.324
<i>Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</i>

54:40.324 --> 54:43.953
-That’s my line.
-Oh. It is mine too.

54:44.036 --> 54:47.081
<i>Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</i>

54:47.122 --> 54:49.667
<i>What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?</i>

54:49.750 --> 54:53.337
<i>The exchange of thy love’s
faithful vow for mine.</i>

54:53.379 --> 54:56.799
<i>My bounty is as boundless
as the sea.</i>

54:56.924 --> 54:59.552
<i>My love is deep.</i>

54:59.635 --> 55:02.179
<i>The more I give to thee...</i>

55:02.263 --> 55:04.223
<i>the more I have...</i>

55:04.306 --> 55:06.392
<i>for both are infinite.</i>

55:08.018 --> 55:08.853
Madam?

55:08.936 --> 55:13.065
<i>-I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.
-Juliet!</i>

55:13.148 --> 55:14.942
Anon, good nurse.

55:14.942 --> 55:18.028
<i>Anon, good nurse
Sweet Montague, be true.</i>

55:18.153 --> 55:21.073
Stay but a little.
I will come again.

55:21.156 --> 55:24.076
<i>Stay but a little.
I will come again.</i>

55:24.159 --> 55:26.537
<i>Oh, blessed, blessed night.</i>

55:27.830 --> 55:30.207
<i>I am a feared...</i>

55:30.332 --> 55:34.712
<i>being in night,
all this is but a dream.</i>

55:34.837 --> 55:39.633
<i>Too flattering sweet
to be substantial.</i>

55:42.428 --> 55:45.431
<i>To cease thy strife
and leave me to my grief.</i>

55:45.431 --> 55:47.433
<i>A thousand times, good night.</i>

55:47.516 --> 55:50.019
<i>A thousand times
the worse to want thy light.</i>

55:50.019 --> 55:53.898
I cannot move in this dress.
It makes me look like a pig.

55:53.898 --> 55:57.568
I have no neck in this pig dress.

56:00.863 --> 56:04.533
-How is it?
-It’s all right.

56:08.454 --> 56:11.207
Ned, I know, I know.

56:11.290 --> 56:14.210
-It’s good.
-Oh?

56:14.293 --> 56:17.046
The title won’t do.

56:17.129 --> 56:18.881
Ah.

56:18.964 --> 56:22.426
"Romeo and Juliet".
Just a suggestion.

56:23.636 --> 56:25.554
Thank you, Ned.

56:27.723 --> 56:32.895
-You are a gentleman.
-And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.

56:32.978 --> 56:35.773
<i>-What o’clock tomorrow shall I send to thee?
-By the hour of nine.</i>

56:35.773 --> 56:38.067
<i>I shall not fail.
"Tis 20 year till then.</i>

56:38.067 --> 56:40.236
<i>I have forgot why I called thee back.</i>

56:40.319 --> 56:43.030
-You mean no dog of any kind?
-Shh! Silence.

56:43.239 --> 56:48.452
The friar marries them in secret, then Ned
gets into a fight with one of the Capulets.

56:48.452 --> 56:51.080
Romeo tries to stop them and gets in
Ned’s way.

56:51.121 --> 56:52.748
I mean, in Mercutio's way.

56:52.790 --> 56:56.210
So Tybalt kills Mercutio,
then Romeo kills Tybalt.

56:56.210 --> 56:58.587
Then the prince banishes him
from Verona.

56:58.587 --> 57:00.881
That must be when he goes on the voyage
and gets shipwrecked...

57:00.965 --> 57:02.967
on the island of the pirate king.

57:02.967 --> 57:06.846
For God’s sake, cease your prattling
and get out!

57:06.929 --> 57:09.390
Get out!

57:12.059 --> 57:13.978
A thousand apologies.

57:15.729 --> 57:18.482
Please.

57:18.566 --> 57:21.402
<i>...and with a silken thread
plucks it back again...</i>

57:21.402 --> 57:23.737
<i>so loving-jealous
of his liberty.</i>

57:23.737 --> 57:26.365
<i>I would I were thy bird.</i>

57:26.365 --> 57:29.451
<i>-Sweet, so would I; yet I should
kill thee with much cherishing.</i>

57:29.869 --> 57:33.038
<i>Good night.
Good night.</i>

57:33.122 --> 57:38.085
<i>Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I
shall say good night till it be morrow.</i>

57:45.676 --> 57:48.470
Sunday.

57:48.554 --> 57:50.681
"Tis Sunday.

57:57.271 --> 58:00.232
I found something in my sleep.

58:00.316 --> 58:03.777
The friar who married them
will take up their destinies.

58:04.653 --> 58:08.574
-But it will end well for love.
-In heaven, perhaps.

58:08.616 --> 58:11.368
It is not a comedy I’m writing now.

58:13.204 --> 58:16.457
A broad river divides my lovers.

58:16.498 --> 58:20.002
Family, duty, fate.

58:22.296 --> 58:25.341
As unchangeable as nature.

58:25.424 --> 58:26.884
Yes.

58:28.344 --> 58:30.971
This is not life, Will.

58:31.472 --> 58:34.058
It is a stolen season.

58:34.850 --> 58:36.227
Be patient, my lord.

58:36.227 --> 58:39.855
-Do you ask Her Majesty to be patient?
-My Lord, I will go...

58:39.855 --> 58:42.942
Sunday.
Greenwich!

58:46.445 --> 58:48.364
Now, pay attention, nursie.

58:48.447 --> 58:50.950
The queen...
Gloriana Regina...

58:51.033 --> 58:54.620
God’s chosen vessel, the radiant one
who shines her light on us...

58:54.620 --> 58:57.831
is at Greenwich today and prepared
during the evening’s festivities...

58:57.831 --> 59:01.085
to bestow her gracious favour
on my choice of wife.

59:01.085 --> 59:03.796
And if we’re late for lunch,
the old boot will not forgive!

59:03.796 --> 59:08.050
So get you to my lady’s chamber and produce her
with or without her undergarments!

59:08.050 --> 59:10.469
You cannot!
Not for the queen herself!

59:10.469 --> 59:13.722
What will you have me do?
Marry you instead?

59:13.806 --> 59:15.975
To be the wife of a poor player?

59:16.016 --> 59:20.437
Can I wish that for Lady Viola
except in my dreams?

59:20.479 --> 59:24.275
And yet I would if I were free to follow
my desire in the harsh light of day.

59:24.316 --> 59:26.902
You follow your desire freely enough
in the night.

59:26.902 --> 59:30.281
-So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
-Then I’ll go with you.

59:30.322 --> 59:33.409
-You cannot. Wessex will kill you.
-I know how to fight.

59:33.409 --> 59:35.494
Stage fighting.

59:36.036 --> 59:37.705
Oh, Will.

59:39.290 --> 59:41.750
As Thomas Kent,
my heart belongs to you...

59:41.792 --> 59:45.129
but as Viola,
the river divides us...

59:45.212 --> 59:49.300
and I must marry Wessex
a week from Saturday.

59:49.383 --> 59:52.303
I’ll drag her down
by the queen’s command!

59:55.222 --> 59:57.224
Good morning, my Lord.

59:57.308 --> 1:00:02.354
My lady. The tide waits for no man,
but I swear it would wait for you.

1:00:02.438 --> 1:00:05.983
Oh, here we come at last, my lord!

1:00:06.066 --> 1:00:08.527
Are you bringing your laundrywoman?

1:00:10.905 --> 1:00:13.699
Her chaperone,
my lady’s country cousin.

1:00:13.699 --> 1:00:18.996
My, but you be a handsome gallant,
just as she said.

1:00:19.038 --> 1:00:21.123
You may call me Miss Wilhelmina.

1:00:21.165 --> 1:00:24.710
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps.

1:00:24.793 --> 1:00:27.630
Oh, my Lord, you will not shake me off.

1:00:27.713 --> 1:00:32.343
Aye, she never needed me more.
I swear by your britches.

1:01:05.042 --> 1:01:06.710
-Now?
-Now.

1:01:07.378 --> 1:01:10.381
The queen asks for you.
Answer well.

1:01:13.300 --> 1:01:15.678
-Is there a man?
-A man, my lord?

1:01:15.678 --> 1:01:19.348
There was a man, a poet.
A theater poet, I think.

1:01:19.348 --> 1:01:22.226
-Does he come to the house?
-A theater poet?

1:01:22.309 --> 1:01:25.896
An insolent penny-a-page rogue!
Marlowe, he said. Christopher Marlowe.

1:01:25.896 --> 1:01:28.190
-Has he been to the house?
-Marlowe?

1:01:28.274 --> 1:01:30.568
Oh, yes. He is the one.

1:01:30.651 --> 1:01:34.154
Lovely waistcoat.
Shame about the poetry.

1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:36.949
That dog!

1:01:52.715 --> 1:01:54.717
Your Majesty.

1:01:55.968 --> 1:01:58.220
Stand up straight, girl.

1:02:01.891 --> 1:02:03.767
I’ve seen you.

1:02:03.893 --> 1:02:07.688
You are the one who comes to all
the plays at Whitehall, at Richmond.

1:02:07.688 --> 1:02:10.232
Your Majesty.

1:02:10.900 --> 1:02:13.277
What do you love so much?

1:02:13.611 --> 1:02:17.031
-Your Majesty...
-Speak up, girl, I know who I am!

1:02:17.573 --> 1:02:20.784
Do you love stories
of kings and queens...

1:02:20.826 --> 1:02:25.414
of feats of arms,
or is it courtly love?

1:02:25.456 --> 1:02:27.458
I love theater.

1:02:27.458 --> 1:02:30.794
To have stories acted for me
by a company of fellows is indeed...

1:02:30.920 --> 1:02:34.507
They’re not acted for you;
they are acted for me. And?

1:02:36.050 --> 1:02:40.679
-And I love poetry above all.
-Above Lord Wessex?

1:02:41.514 --> 1:02:45.809
My lord, when you cannot find your wife,
you better look for her at the playhouse.

1:02:47.811 --> 1:02:51.106
Playwrights teach us
nothing about love.

1:02:51.148 --> 1:02:54.610
They make it pretty; they make
it comical; or they make it lust.

1:02:54.610 --> 1:02:57.863
-They cannot make it true.
-Oh, but they can.

1:03:01.784 --> 1:03:06.956
I mean, Your Majesty, they...
they do not, they have... not...

1:03:07.039 --> 1:03:09.834
but I believe
there is one who can.

1:03:10.334 --> 1:03:14.797
My Lady Viola is young in the world.
Your Majesty is wise in it.

1:03:14.839 --> 1:03:17.591
Nature and truth
are the very enemies of playacting.

1:03:17.633 --> 1:03:21.804
-I’ll wager my fortune.
-I thought you were here because you had none.

1:03:27.434 --> 1:03:31.647
-Well, no one will take your wager, it seems.
-50 pounds.

1:03:34.316 --> 1:03:36.193
50 pounds?

1:03:37.736 --> 1:03:42.658
A very worthy sum on a very worthy question.

1:03:42.741 --> 1:03:47.580
Can a play show us the very truth
and nature of love?

1:03:47.955 --> 1:03:51.208
I bear witness to the wager...

1:03:51.292 --> 1:03:54.837
and will be the judge of it
as occasion arises.

1:03:57.131 --> 1:03:59.842
I have seen nothing
to settle it yet.

1:04:00.759 --> 1:04:03.345
Are there no more fireworks?

1:04:03.429 --> 1:04:07.892
They would be soothing after the
excitements of Lady Viola’s audience.

1:04:08.475 --> 1:04:11.645
Have her, then,
but you are a lordly fool.

1:04:11.729 --> 1:04:15.774
She’s been plucked since I saw her last,
and not by you.

1:04:15.774 --> 1:04:18.694
It takes a woman to know it.

1:04:22.323 --> 1:04:24.241
Marlowe.

1:04:35.169 --> 1:04:37.087
Burbage?

1:04:37.171 --> 1:04:40.049
Huh? Who’s there?

1:04:40.132 --> 1:04:42.801
Marlowe.

1:04:44.345 --> 1:04:46.472
You are playing my Dr. Faustus this afternoon.

1:04:46.472 --> 1:04:48.682
Don’t spend yourself in sport.

1:04:48.766 --> 1:04:52.436
-What do you want, Kit?
-My "Massacre at Paris" is complete.

1:04:52.436 --> 1:04:55.814
-What? You have the last act?
-If you have the money.

1:04:55.814 --> 1:04:59.902
-Tomorrow.
-Then tomorrow you shall have the pages.

1:04:59.985 --> 1:05:02.279
Oh, will you desist, madam!

1:05:02.363 --> 1:05:05.282
-Oh!
-20 pounds on delivery.

1:05:05.324 --> 1:05:08.661
Now, what is money to men like us?

1:05:09.578 --> 1:05:14.542
Besides, if I need a play, I have another
waiting... a comedy by Shakespeare.

1:05:14.625 --> 1:05:16.502
Oh, "Romeo".

1:05:16.585 --> 1:05:19.797
-Gave it to Henslowe.
-Never!

1:05:19.880 --> 1:05:22.967
Well, I’m to Deptford.
I leave you my respects, Miss Rosaline.

1:05:22.967 --> 1:05:26.095
I gave Shakespeare
2 sovereigns for "Romeo".

1:05:26.178 --> 1:05:30.683
You did, but Ned Alleyn and the Admiral’s Men
have the playing of it at the "Rose".

1:05:30.683 --> 1:05:32.643
Treachery!

1:05:33.978 --> 1:05:36.230
Traitor and thief!

1:05:39.149 --> 1:05:41.402
Oh, no.

1:05:41.443 --> 1:05:43.487
No!

1:06:01.255 --> 1:06:03.424
<i>By my head, here comes the Capulets.</i>

1:06:03.424 --> 1:06:06.343
<i>By my heel, I care not.</i>

1:06:07.469 --> 1:06:09.805
<i>Follow me close.
I will speak with them.</i>

1:06:09.805 --> 1:06:12.892
<i>Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.</i>

1:06:12.933 --> 1:06:15.186
Are you going to do it like that?

1:06:15.269 --> 1:06:17.479
Positions.

1:06:17.563 --> 1:06:21.942
<i>-By my head, here comes the Capulets.
-By my heel, I care not.</i>

1:06:21.942 --> 1:06:24.278
<i>Follow me close.
I will speak to them.</i>

1:06:24.278 --> 1:06:27.239
<i>Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.</i>

1:06:27.489 --> 1:06:30.701
<i>And but one word with one of us?</i>

1:06:30.784 --> 1:06:33.621
<i>Couple it with something;
make it a word and a blow.</i>

1:06:33.621 --> 1:06:37.458
Where’s that thieving hack that
can’t keep his pen in his own ink pot?

1:06:37.458 --> 1:06:39.585
What is this rabble?

1:06:41.921 --> 1:06:44.715
Draw, if you be a man!

1:07:07.738 --> 1:07:10.115
Wonderful.
Wonderful!

1:07:10.991 --> 1:07:14.411
And a dog.

1:07:15.996 --> 1:07:17.957
No!

1:07:18.040 --> 1:07:21.293
Have privy, players! Please!

1:07:21.377 --> 1:07:24.255
Oh! Not with my props!

1:07:24.338 --> 1:07:25.756
Oh!

1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:28.759
-Will! What...
-A writer’s quarrel.

1:07:28.843 --> 1:07:31.220
Quite normal.

1:07:32.638 --> 1:07:34.765
Stay here.

1:07:47.486 --> 1:07:49.071
You are hurt.

1:08:02.042 --> 1:08:05.504
I dreamed last night
of a shipwreck.

1:08:05.588 --> 1:08:10.509
-You were cast ashore in a far country.
-Oh, not yet. Not yet.

1:08:10.634 --> 1:08:13.679
Hey, we need that
for the balcony scene.

1:08:13.679 --> 1:08:15.973
My investment!
Lambert!

1:08:17.433 --> 1:08:19.643
Vengeance!

1:08:47.129 --> 1:08:49.173
A famous victory!

1:08:49.298 --> 1:08:53.344
Kegs and legs open,
and on the house!

1:08:53.469 --> 1:08:55.554
Oh, what happy hour.

1:08:55.638 --> 1:08:58.807
-This is a tavern!
-It is also a tavern.

1:08:58.849 --> 1:09:03.687
-I remember you. The poet!
-Yes, William the Conqueror.

1:09:04.104 --> 1:09:06.857
One at a time.
One at a time.

1:09:06.941 --> 1:09:11.487
Oh, he’s a pretty one. Tell me
your story while I tickle your fancy.

1:09:14.949 --> 1:09:18.786
-It’s a house of ill repute.
-It is, Thomas, but of good reputation.

1:09:18.786 --> 1:09:21.664
Come.
There’s no harm in a drink.

1:09:21.747 --> 1:09:26.544
You are welcome to my best house.
Here’s to the Admiral’s Men.

1:09:26.627 --> 1:09:28.420
-The Admiral’s Men!
-The Admiral’s Men!

1:09:28.420 --> 1:09:30.339
The Admiral’s Men!

1:09:53.487 --> 1:09:56.740
Well, I... I quite liked it.

1:09:56.824 --> 1:09:58.284
Master Kent...

1:09:59.034 --> 1:10:02.162
you have not yet dipped your wick.

1:10:03.664 --> 1:10:05.833
My wick?

1:10:06.333 --> 1:10:10.629
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theater,
you must have a part in my play.

1:10:10.629 --> 1:10:15.593
I am writing an apothecary,
a small but vital role.

1:10:15.676 --> 1:10:18.762
My heavens.
I thank you.

1:10:18.846 --> 1:10:21.140
What’s the play about, then?

1:10:21.223 --> 1:10:23.392
Well, there’s this nurse...

1:10:28.105 --> 1:10:30.983
Silence, silence, silence!

1:10:31.692 --> 1:10:38.449
Master Shakespeare has asked me
to play the part of the apothecary.

1:10:40.326 --> 1:10:42.786
The apothecary?

1:10:42.786 --> 1:10:46.373
Will, what is this story?
Where is the shipwreck?

1:10:46.457 --> 1:10:48.626
How does the comedy end?

1:10:48.751 --> 1:10:53.005
-By God, I wish I knew.
-By God, if you do not, who does?

1:10:53.005 --> 1:10:56.717
Let us have pirates,
clowns and a happy ending...

1:10:56.759 --> 1:11:00.888
or we shall send you
back to Stratford to your wife.

1:11:16.570 --> 1:11:19.865
Will! Mr. Henslowe! Gentlemen all!

1:11:19.949 --> 1:11:23.827
A black day for us all!
There is news from a tavern in Deptford.

1:11:23.827 --> 1:11:26.247
Marlowe is dead.

1:11:30.167 --> 1:11:32.503
Stabbed.

1:11:32.586 --> 1:11:36.966
Stabbed to death
in a tavern at Deptford.

1:11:39.301 --> 1:11:41.303
What have I done?

1:11:41.929 --> 1:11:44.765
He was the first man among us.

1:11:44.849 --> 1:11:47.518
A great light has gone out.

1:12:03.284 --> 1:12:05.327
Forgive me.

1:12:08.372 --> 1:12:10.624
God forgive me.

1:12:37.193 --> 1:12:40.362
...Our Lord
Jesus Christ’s sake.

1:12:40.446 --> 1:12:42.865
~One morning in the month of May~

1:12:42.948 --> 1:12:45.993
~From my cot I stray~

1:12:46.076 --> 1:12:48.746
~Just at the dawning of the day~

1:12:48.829 --> 1:12:51.415
~I met with a charming maid~

1:12:53.334 --> 1:12:57.087
You look sad, my lady.
Let me take you riding.

1:12:57.171 --> 1:13:01.175
-It’s not my riding day, my lord.
-Bless me, I thought it was a horse.

1:13:01.759 --> 1:13:03.302
I’m going to church.

1:13:03.385 --> 1:13:07.097
Of course. I understand.
It is to be expected.

1:13:07.181 --> 1:13:10.601
Yes, it is to be expected...
on Sunday.

1:13:10.684 --> 1:13:13.979
And on a day of mourning.

1:13:14.063 --> 1:13:17.191
I never met the fellow
but once at your house.

1:13:17.274 --> 1:13:19.276
Mourning?

1:13:21.028 --> 1:13:23.781
Who is dead, my lord?

1:13:23.864 --> 1:13:28.786
Oh! Dear God, I did not think
it would be me to tell you.

1:13:28.869 --> 1:13:33.499
Great loss to playwriting
and to dancing.

1:13:34.625 --> 1:13:36.544
My lady.

1:13:36.627 --> 1:13:40.297
-He is dead?
-Killed last night in a tavern.

1:13:41.924 --> 1:13:45.511
Come then.
We’ll say a prayer for his soul.

1:13:49.557 --> 1:13:56.230
~Who can remember sorrow~

1:14:29.180 --> 1:14:34.268
Spare me, dear ghost.

1:14:34.351 --> 1:14:37.897
Spare me, for the love of Christ.
Spare me!

1:14:51.410 --> 1:14:52.661
Will!

1:14:53.787 --> 1:14:55.664
Oh, my love.

1:14:56.457 --> 1:14:58.542
I thought you were dead.

1:15:03.005 --> 1:15:04.882
It is worse.

1:15:05.799 --> 1:15:07.885
I’ve killed a man.

1:15:12.223 --> 1:15:15.142
Marlowe’s touch
was in my "Titus Andronicus"...

1:15:15.142 --> 1:15:18.771
and my "Henry 6th" was a house built
on his foundations.

1:15:19.897 --> 1:15:22.566
You never spoke so well of him.

1:15:22.566 --> 1:15:24.860
He was not dead before.

1:15:25.778 --> 1:15:30.950
I would exchange all my plays to come
for all of his that will never come.

1:15:31.867 --> 1:15:34.036
You lie.

1:15:35.704 --> 1:15:39.875
You lie by this river
as you lied in my bed.

1:15:39.959 --> 1:15:42.419
My love is no lie.

1:15:43.587 --> 1:15:46.131
I have a wife, yes...

1:15:46.215 --> 1:15:49.552
and I cannot marry the daughter
of Sir Robert De Lesseps.

1:15:49.552 --> 1:15:54.640
You needed no wife come from Stratford
to tell you that...

1:15:54.640 --> 1:15:57.726
and yet, you let me come to your bed.

1:15:57.810 --> 1:16:01.063
Calf-love.

1:16:01.146 --> 1:16:05.568
I loved the writer and gave up
the prize for a sonnet.

1:16:05.651 --> 1:16:08.404
I was the more deceived.

1:16:08.487 --> 1:16:11.407
Yes, you were deceived...

1:16:11.490 --> 1:16:14.869
for I did not know
how much I loved you.

1:16:17.496 --> 1:16:20.583
I love you, Will...

1:16:20.666 --> 1:16:22.751
beyond poetry.

1:16:22.835 --> 1:16:25.337
Oh, my love.

1:16:25.421 --> 1:16:29.508
-You ran from me before.
-When I thought you dead, I did not care...

1:16:29.550 --> 1:16:31.844
about all the plays
that would never come...

1:16:31.927 --> 1:16:34.722
only that I would
never see your face.

1:16:34.722 --> 1:16:38.017
I saw our end and it will come.

1:16:38.142 --> 1:16:42.730
-You cannot marry Wessex.
-If not you, why not Wessex?

1:16:42.730 --> 1:16:45.399
If not Wessex, the queen
will know the cause...

1:16:45.399 --> 1:16:50.070
-and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
-No. No.

1:16:50.154 --> 1:16:54.617
But I will go to Wessex
as a widow from these vows...

1:16:54.742 --> 1:16:57.786
as solemn as they
are unsanctified.

1:16:59.246 --> 1:17:02.583
For killing Juliet’s
kinsman Tybalt...

1:17:02.583 --> 1:17:05.461
the one who killed
Romeo’s friend Mercutio...

1:17:05.503 --> 1:17:09.256
Romeo is banished. But the friar
who married Romeo and Juliet...

1:17:09.298 --> 1:17:10.299
Is that me?

1:17:10.299 --> 1:17:15.262
You, Edward. The friar who married
them gives Juliet a potion to drink.

1:17:15.262 --> 1:17:19.058
It is a secret potion.
It makes us seeming dead.

1:17:19.099 --> 1:17:22.061
She is placed in the tomb of the Capulets.

1:17:22.144 --> 1:17:25.731
She will awake to life and love
when Romeo comes to her side again.

1:17:27.858 --> 1:17:30.152
I have not said all.

1:17:31.237 --> 1:17:37.201
By maligned fate, the message goes astray
which would tell Romeo of the friar’s plan.

1:17:37.243 --> 1:17:40.538
He hears only that Juliet is dead.

1:17:41.163 --> 1:17:44.500
-And thus he goes to the apothecary...
-That’s me.

1:17:44.542 --> 1:17:47.378
...and buys a deadly poison.

1:17:47.378 --> 1:17:50.172
He enters the tomb to say farewell
to Juliet...

1:17:50.172 --> 1:17:52.633
who lies there cold as death.

1:17:53.050 --> 1:17:55.803
He drinks the poison.

1:17:56.178 --> 1:17:59.306
He dies by her side...

1:17:59.932 --> 1:18:03.686
and then she wakes
and sees him dead.

1:18:04.311 --> 1:18:08.315
And so Juliet takes his dagger...

1:18:08.649 --> 1:18:10.234
and then kills herself.

1:18:14.738 --> 1:18:17.867
Well, that will have them
rolling in the aisles.

1:18:17.950 --> 1:18:20.828
Sad... and wonderful.

1:18:21.996 --> 1:18:24.915
I have a blue velvet cap
that’ll do well.

1:18:24.915 --> 1:18:29.753
I’ve seen just such a cap
on an apothecary. Just so.

1:18:31.005 --> 1:18:34.091
Yes, it will serve.

1:18:36.010 --> 1:18:38.512
But there’s a scene missing.

1:18:39.138 --> 1:18:42.057
Between marriage and death?

1:18:47.688 --> 1:18:51.775
The play...
all written out for you.

1:18:53.319 --> 1:18:56.030
I had the clerk at Bridewell do it.

1:18:56.030 --> 1:18:58.449
He has a good fist for lettering.

1:19:00.326 --> 1:19:03.370
There is a new scene.

1:19:08.626 --> 1:19:10.628
Will you read in for me?

1:19:10.669 --> 1:19:13.964
<i>Wilt thou be gone?
It’s not yet near day.</i>

1:19:14.840 --> 1:19:16.550
<i>It was the nightingale, and not the lark...</i>

1:19:16.634 --> 1:19:19.303
<i>that pierced the fearful hollow
of thine ear.</i>

1:19:19.303 --> 1:19:25.351
<i>Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.</i>

1:19:25.392 --> 1:19:29.438
<i>It was the lark,
the herald of the morn...</i>

1:19:29.522 --> 1:19:31.857
<i>no nightingale.</i>

1:19:31.941 --> 1:19:34.944
<i>Look, love,
what envious streaks...</i>

1:19:34.944 --> 1:19:39.073
<i>do lace the severing clouds
in yonder east.</i>

1:19:39.156 --> 1:19:42.993
<i>Night’s candles are burnt out...</i>

1:19:43.077 --> 1:19:48.958
<i>and jocund day stands tiptoe
on the misty mountaintops.</i>

1:19:49.041 --> 1:19:53.754
<i>I must be gone and live,
or stay and die.</i>

1:19:55.256 --> 1:19:59.301
<i>Yon light is not daylight;
I know it, I.</i>

1:19:59.385 --> 1:20:02.346
<i>It is some meteor
that the sun exhales...</i>

1:20:02.429 --> 1:20:07.101
<i>to be to thee this night a torchbearer...</i>

1:20:07.184 --> 1:20:10.396
<i>to light thee on thy way to Mantua.</i>

1:20:12.064 --> 1:20:17.903
<i>Therefore, stay yet.
Thou needst not to be gone.</i>

1:20:18.028 --> 1:20:23.450
<i>Let me be ta'en,
let me be put to death.</i>

1:20:23.534 --> 1:20:27.830
<i>I am content, so thou wilt have it so.</i>

1:20:27.955 --> 1:20:33.002
<i>I have more care to stay...
than will to go.</i>

1:20:33.085 --> 1:20:38.549
<i>Come, death, and welcome.
Juliet wills it so.</i>

1:21:01.488 --> 1:21:04.575
You will go far, I fear.

1:21:08.537 --> 1:21:11.040
I hope we work together again.

1:21:13.459 --> 1:21:19.006
<i>Such mortal drugs I have,
but Mantua’s law is death...</i>

1:21:19.006 --> 1:21:21.383
<i>death to any he that utters them.</i>

1:21:21.634 --> 1:21:24.512
Then him. Then me.

1:21:24.512 --> 1:21:28.849
<i>Put this in any liquid thing you will and...</i>

1:21:28.974 --> 1:21:33.187
What is it? What is it?

1:21:33.270 --> 1:21:37.233
<i>How silver sweet sound
lovers" tongues by night.</i>

1:21:37.274 --> 1:21:39.485
<i>-Like soft music...
-Shakespeare!</i>

1:21:56.669 --> 1:21:59.630
Upstart inky pup!

1:21:59.755 --> 1:22:02.716
I’ll show you your place,
which is in hell!

1:22:07.054 --> 1:22:10.516
-You’re on my ground now!
-By God, I’ll fight the lot of you!

1:22:10.516 --> 1:22:12.434
I am more than enough!

1:22:20.109 --> 1:22:22.278
Move!

1:23:44.276 --> 1:23:46.779
Absent friends.

1:23:48.030 --> 1:23:51.158
This is the murderer of Kit Marlowe!

1:23:51.784 --> 1:23:53.035
Will?

1:23:53.077 --> 1:23:56.997
I rejoiced in his death because I thought
it was yours! That is all I know of Marlowe!

1:23:56.997 --> 1:24:00.584
Will? Uh, it’s true.

1:24:00.668 --> 1:24:03.462
It was a... tavern brawl.

1:24:03.546 --> 1:24:08.509
Marlowe attacked
and got his own knife in the eye.

1:24:08.592 --> 1:24:10.845
A quarrel about the bill.

1:24:10.886 --> 1:24:14.223
The bill?
Oh, vanity, vanity!

1:24:14.265 --> 1:24:17.601
Not the billing,
the bill!

1:24:21.981 --> 1:24:25.317
-Oh, God. I am free of it.
-Where is she?

1:24:27.236 --> 1:24:29.572
-Close it.
-My Lord Wessex.

1:24:29.613 --> 1:24:32.825
The Rose harbors the ass
that shits on my name!

1:24:32.908 --> 1:24:35.119
Take it down stone by stone.

1:24:35.202 --> 1:24:38.998
I want it plowed into the ground
and sown with quicklime!

1:24:38.998 --> 1:24:40.958
Mr. Tilney, what is this?

1:24:40.958 --> 1:24:43.460
Sedition and indecency.

1:24:43.460 --> 1:24:46.172
Master of the Revels, sir.
She’s over here.

1:24:46.255 --> 1:24:48.883
-Where, boy?
-There.

1:24:48.966 --> 1:24:51.135
I saw her bubbies.

1:24:51.218 --> 1:24:55.598
So, a woman on the stage!

1:24:55.681 --> 1:24:59.810
A woman!
I say this theater is closed!

1:24:59.894 --> 1:25:01.353
Why, sir?

1:25:01.437 --> 1:25:05.566
For lewdness and unashamed faced ness!

1:25:05.649 --> 1:25:10.529
And for displaying a female
on the public stage!

1:25:25.628 --> 1:25:27.671
Not him, her!

1:25:31.425 --> 1:25:33.260
That’s who I meant.

1:25:35.346 --> 1:25:38.849
-He’s a woman.
-This theater is closed.

1:25:40.768 --> 1:25:44.188
Notice will be posted!

1:25:44.271 --> 1:25:47.233
Ned, I swear, I knew nothing of this.

1:25:47.316 --> 1:25:50.194
-Nobody knew.
-He did.

1:25:50.277 --> 1:25:53.280
I saw him kissing her bubbies.

1:25:55.741 --> 1:25:57.868
It is over.

1:25:58.577 --> 1:26:01.705
I’m sorry, Mr. Henslowe.

1:26:16.095 --> 1:26:18.430
I wanted to be an actor.

1:26:19.849 --> 1:26:21.934
I’m so sorry, Will.

1:26:27.648 --> 1:26:30.734
You were... w-w...

1:26:31.986 --> 1:26:34.196
w-wonderful.

1:26:35.823 --> 1:26:38.033
Thank you.

1:26:46.667 --> 1:26:50.921
<i>Put this in any liquid thing you will
and...</i>

1:26:57.344 --> 1:26:59.889
Everything all right?

1:27:37.009 --> 1:27:39.720
I would’ve been good.

1:27:40.679 --> 1:27:43.724
-I would’ve been great.
-So would I.

1:27:43.849 --> 1:27:46.227
We both would.

1:28:08.499 --> 1:28:10.960
Lambert, kill him.

1:28:12.294 --> 1:28:14.588
That can wait.

1:28:18.259 --> 1:28:24.098
The Master of the Revels despises us all
for vagrants and peddlers of bombast.

1:28:25.099 --> 1:28:27.309
But my father, James Burbage...

1:28:27.309 --> 1:28:31.772
had the first license to make a company
of players from Her Majesty...

1:28:31.856 --> 1:28:36.569
and he drew from poets
the literature of the age.

1:28:36.652 --> 1:28:40.155
We must show them
that we are men of parts.

1:28:40.239 --> 1:28:42.908
Will Shakespeare has a play.

1:28:43.742 --> 1:28:48.205
I have a theater.
The "Curtain" is yours.

1:29:21.572 --> 1:29:25.117
Will!
We’ll be needing a Romeo.

1:29:31.832 --> 1:29:33.959
Oranges! Sweet oranges!

1:30:01.737 --> 1:30:03.697
My ship is moored at bank side...

1:30:03.697 --> 1:30:06.700
bound for Virginia
on the afternoon tide.

1:30:06.742 --> 1:30:10.120
Please do not weep, Lady De Lesseps.
You are gaining a colony.

1:30:10.204 --> 1:30:15.626
And you, my lord, are gaining 5,000 pounds
by these drafts in my hand.

1:30:15.709 --> 1:30:18.462
Would you oblige me with 50 or so in gold...

1:30:18.546 --> 1:30:21.632
just to settle my accounts
at the dockside?

1:30:22.925 --> 1:30:25.803
Ah, the bride!

1:30:27.054 --> 1:30:29.974
Good morning, my lord.

1:30:30.057 --> 1:30:34.520
I see you are... open for business,
so let’s to church.

1:30:40.109 --> 1:30:41.151
Be gone!

1:31:39.543 --> 1:31:41.462
Oh, my lord!

1:31:41.545 --> 1:31:44.131
-Be good to her, my lord.
-I will.

1:31:44.215 --> 1:31:46.300
Oh, God bless you!

1:31:46.383 --> 1:31:49.220
Thank you. Uh, let go.
There’s a good nurse.

1:31:49.303 --> 1:31:51.263
The tide will not wait!

1:31:51.347 --> 1:31:55.226
Farewell!
You’ll all be welcome in Virginia!

1:32:21.752 --> 1:32:26.423
Candy apples!

1:32:26.507 --> 1:32:30.052
Buy my apples!

1:32:34.557 --> 1:32:36.767
Thank you, sir.
Apples!

1:32:44.275 --> 1:32:47.653
Is this, uh...
Is this all right?

1:32:47.736 --> 1:32:49.655
Yeah.

1:33:04.962 --> 1:33:09.258
Licentiousness is made a show!
Vice is made a show!

1:33:09.383 --> 1:33:13.929
Vanity and pride
likewise made a show!

1:33:14.013 --> 1:33:18.976
This is the very business of show!

1:33:28.110 --> 1:33:32.656
T- T- T- Two...

1:33:32.740 --> 1:33:35.367
T- T- T- T... T... T...

1:33:35.451 --> 1:33:39.121
T... T- T- Two households...

1:33:39.205 --> 1:33:42.124
-We’re lost.
-No, it will turn out well.

1:33:42.249 --> 1:33:45.669
-How will it?
-I don’t know. It’s a mystery.

1:33:48.214 --> 1:33:51.717
T- T... T... T- T...

1:33:51.842 --> 1:33:54.178
T... T...

1:34:45.479 --> 1:34:48.023
Two households...

1:34:48.107 --> 1:34:51.235
both alike in dignity...

1:34:51.318 --> 1:34:54.071
in fair Verona...

1:34:54.154 --> 1:34:56.740
where we lay our scene.

1:34:56.824 --> 1:34:59.910
From ancient grudge break
to new mutiny...

1:34:59.952 --> 1:35:03.372
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

1:35:03.414 --> 1:35:06.458
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

1:35:06.500 --> 1:35:09.670
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life...

1:35:09.712 --> 1:35:12.506
whose misadventured,
piteous overthrows...

1:35:12.548 --> 1:35:16.010
doth with their death
bury their parents" strife.

1:35:19.180 --> 1:35:22.266
...the which of you
with patient ears attend...

1:35:22.349 --> 1:35:27.104
what here shall miss,
our toil shall strive to mend.

1:35:33.444 --> 1:35:35.446
-Wonderful.
-Was it...

1:35:36.572 --> 1:35:38.616
good?

1:35:41.368 --> 1:35:44.538
<i>Gregory, on my word
we’ll not carry coals.</i>

1:35:44.622 --> 1:35:47.666
<i>No, for then
we should be colliers.</i>

1:35:47.750 --> 1:35:50.252
<i>I mean, and we be
in choler we’ll draw.</i>

1:35:50.336 --> 1:35:53.422
-Master Shakespeare.
-Luck be with you, Sam. Sam!

1:35:53.506 --> 1:35:56.717
It’s not my fault.
I could do it yesterday.

1:35:56.717 --> 1:35:59.220
Do me a speech. Do me a line.

1:35:59.303 --> 1:36:03.140
<i>Parting is such sweet sorrow.</i>

1:36:03.224 --> 1:36:06.477
-Another little problem.
-What do we do now?

1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:10.481
-The show must... You know.
-Go on!

1:36:10.564 --> 1:36:13.984
Juliet does not come on for 20 pages.
It will be all right.

1:36:14.068 --> 1:36:16.487
-How will it?
-I don’t know. It’s a mystery.

1:36:16.570 --> 1:36:18.864
<i>-Fear me not.
-No, marry, I fear thee!</i>

1:36:21.283 --> 1:36:24.161
<i>-Let them begin.
-I will frown as I pass by.</i>

1:36:24.245 --> 1:36:28.040
<i>-Let them take it as they list!
-Nay, as they dare.</i>

1:36:28.123 --> 1:36:32.169
<i>I will bite my thumb at them, which is
disgrace to them if they bear it.</i>

1:36:32.253 --> 1:36:35.172
<i>Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?</i>

1:36:35.256 --> 1:36:38.551
<i>-I do bite my thumb, sir.
-Excuse me. Thank you.</i>

1:36:38.634 --> 1:36:42.263
<i>-Thank you. Excuse me.
-Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</i>

1:36:42.346 --> 1:36:44.181
-Can we talk?
-Shh!

1:36:44.223 --> 1:36:47.059
-We have no Juliet.
-No Juliet?

1:36:47.101 --> 1:36:50.020
-No Juliet?
-It’ll be all right, madam.

1:36:50.062 --> 1:36:52.398
-What happened to Sam?
-Who are you?

1:36:52.439 --> 1:36:54.316
Thomas Kent.

1:36:54.733 --> 1:36:56.819
Do you know it?

1:36:58.112 --> 1:37:00.197
Every word.

1:37:09.707 --> 1:37:12.710
<i>I’ll go along,
no such sight to be shown...</i>

1:37:12.793 --> 1:37:15.921
<i>but to rejoice in splendor
of mine own.</i>

1:37:16.005 --> 1:37:18.299
<i>Nurse!</i>

1:37:20.676 --> 1:37:23.929
<i>Where’s my daughter?
Call her forth to me.</i>

1:37:24.013 --> 1:37:27.224
<i>Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old...</i>

1:37:27.308 --> 1:37:29.226
<i>I bade her come.</i>

1:37:29.310 --> 1:37:31.395
How now, who calls?

1:37:31.478 --> 1:37:34.231
<i>What, ladybird!</i>

1:37:34.315 --> 1:37:36.066
<i>God forbid!
Where’s this girl?</i>

1:37:36.150 --> 1:37:38.777
<i>What, lamb!</i>

1:37:38.861 --> 1:37:41.071
<i>What, ladybird!</i>

1:37:42.156 --> 1:37:44.575
<i>What, Juliet!</i>

1:37:45.701 --> 1:37:49.079
<i>How now, who calls?</i>

1:37:52.041 --> 1:37:56.629
-We’ll all be put in the Clink.
-See you in jail.

1:37:59.757 --> 1:38:02.927
<i>Your mother...
Your mother.</i>

1:38:03.010 --> 1:38:06.305
<i>Madam, I am here.
What is your will?</i>

1:38:06.388 --> 1:38:08.432
<i>This is the matter.</i>

1:38:08.516 --> 1:38:10.935
<i>Nurse, give leave a while.
We must talk in secret.</i>

1:38:11.018 --> 1:38:15.773
<i>Nurse, come back again. I have
remembered me; thou's hear our counsel.</i>

1:38:15.856 --> 1:38:19.193
<i>Thou knowest my daughter’s
of a pretty age.</i>

1:38:19.276 --> 1:38:22.780
<i>-Faith, I know her age unto an hour.
-She’s not 14.</i>

1:38:22.863 --> 1:38:28.369
<i>Oh, I’ll lay 14 of my teeth.
And yet my teen be it spoken...</i>

1:38:28.452 --> 1:38:31.205
<i>I have but 4.</i>

1:38:53.394 --> 1:38:55.437
<i>Tell me, daughter Juliet...</i>

1:38:55.521 --> 1:39:00.109
<i>how stands your dispositions
to be married?</i>

1:39:00.192 --> 1:39:03.320
<i>It is an honor
that I dream not of.</i>

1:39:07.616 --> 1:39:10.494
<i>Hold, Tybalt!
Good Mercutio!</i>

1:39:19.795 --> 1:39:21.463
<i>I’m sped.</i>

1:39:21.547 --> 1:39:24.341
<i>Courage, man;
the hurt cannot be much.</i>

1:39:24.425 --> 1:39:29.722
<i>Ask for me tomorrow,
you shall find me a grave man.</i>

1:39:36.937 --> 1:39:37.980
<i>Yes!</i>

1:39:45.446 --> 1:39:46.488
<i>Yah!</i>

1:39:47.281 --> 1:39:50.034
<i>Such mortal drugs I have...</i>

1:39:50.117 --> 1:39:54.747
<i>but Mantua’s law is death
to any he that utters them.</i>

1:39:54.872 --> 1:39:57.374
Then him. Then me.

1:40:05.883 --> 1:40:07.927
<i>Romeo, away, be gone!</i>

1:40:08.052 --> 1:40:12.431
<i>The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed!</i>

1:40:12.556 --> 1:40:16.769
<i>The prince will doom thee death if thou
art taken. Hence, be gone, away!</i>

1:40:18.020 --> 1:40:20.314
<i>Oh, I am Fortune’s fool!</i>

1:40:20.439 --> 1:40:22.316
<i>Why dost thou stay?</i>

1:40:22.441 --> 1:40:24.401
<i>Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?</i>

1:40:24.527 --> 1:40:26.695
<i>That murderer, which way ran he?</i>

1:40:26.820 --> 1:40:29.573
<i>-There lies that Tybalt.
-Up, sir. Go with me.</i>

1:40:29.698 --> 1:40:31.700
<i>I charge thee
in the Prince’s name obey.</i>

1:40:31.825 --> 1:40:34.495
<i>Where are the vile beginners
of this fray?</i>

1:40:34.620 --> 1:40:36.830
<i>Oh, I am Fortune’s fool.</i>

1:40:39.667 --> 1:40:41.585
<i>You are married?</i>

1:40:45.256 --> 1:40:50.261
<i>If you be married, my grave
is like to be my wedding bed.</i>

1:41:06.026 --> 1:41:08.237
<i>Art thou gone so...</i>

1:41:10.865 --> 1:41:12.992
<i>love, lord...</i>

1:41:13.075 --> 1:41:15.286
<i>aye, husband, friend?</i>

1:41:15.369 --> 1:41:20.124
<i>I must hear from thee
every day in the hour...</i>

1:41:20.207 --> 1:41:23.127
<i>for in a minute
there are many days.</i>

1:41:23.210 --> 1:41:26.797
<i>Oh, by this count
I shall be much in years ere again...</i>

1:41:26.881 --> 1:41:29.300
<i>I behold my Romeo.</i>

1:41:29.884 --> 1:41:31.302
<i>Farewell.</i>

1:41:32.803 --> 1:41:36.348
<i>Oh, thinks thou we shall ever meet again?</i>

1:41:37.766 --> 1:41:40.811
<i>Methinks I see thee,
now thou art so low...</i>

1:41:40.895 --> 1:41:44.356
<i>as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.</i>

1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:48.611
<i>Either my eyesight fails,
or thou look’s pale.</i>

1:41:50.070 --> 1:41:52.281
<i>Then trust me, love...</i>

1:41:52.364 --> 1:41:54.700
<i>in my eyes, so do you.</i>

1:41:54.783 --> 1:41:58.537
<i>Dry sorrow
drinks our blood.</i>

1:41:58.621 --> 1:42:00.539
<i>Adieu.</i>

1:42:02.041 --> 1:42:04.668
<i>Adieu.</i>

1:42:04.752 --> 1:42:07.505
<i>Take thou this vial,
being then in bed...</i>

1:42:07.588 --> 1:42:10.674
<i>and this distilling liquor
drink thou off.</i>

1:42:10.758 --> 1:42:14.720
<i>No warmth, no breath,
shall testify thou livest.</i>

1:42:14.803 --> 1:42:17.765
<i>And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death...</i>

1:42:17.848 --> 1:42:21.060
<i>thou shalt continue
2 and 40 hours...</i>

1:42:21.143 --> 1:42:24.772
<i>and then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.</i>

1:42:24.855 --> 1:42:26.941
<i>What ho! Apothecary!</i>

1:42:30.444 --> 1:42:34.073
<i>Come hither, man.
I see that thou art poor.</i>

1:42:34.156 --> 1:42:37.076
<i>Hold, there is 40 ducats.</i>

1:42:37.159 --> 1:42:40.913
<i>-Let me have a dram of poison...
-Such mortal drugs I have...</i>

1:42:40.996 --> 1:42:45.042
<i>but Mantua’s law is death
to any he that utters them.</i>

1:42:45.125 --> 1:42:48.629
<i>-Art thou so...
-My poverty, but not my will, consents.</i>

1:42:54.468 --> 1:42:57.596
<i>I pay thy poverty
and not thy will.</i>

1:43:01.392 --> 1:43:03.561
<i>Eyes, look your last.</i>

1:43:03.644 --> 1:43:06.397
<i>Arms, take your last embrace.</i>

1:43:06.480 --> 1:43:12.361
<i>And, lips,
oh, you, the doors of breath...</i>

1:43:12.444 --> 1:43:14.864
<i>seal with a righteous kiss...</i>

1:43:16.824 --> 1:43:21.412
<i>the dateless bargain
to engrossing death.</i>

1:43:22.705 --> 1:43:28.919
<i>Come, bitter conduct.
Come, unsavoury guide.</i>

1:43:29.003 --> 1:43:32.715
<i>Thou, desperate pilot,
now at once...</i>

1:43:32.798 --> 1:43:37.595
<i>run on the dashing rocks
thy seasick weary bark.</i>

1:43:37.678 --> 1:43:40.097
<i>Here’s to my love!</i>

1:43:48.022 --> 1:43:51.192
<i>Oh... true apothecary!</i>

1:43:55.196 --> 1:43:57.448
<i>Thy drugs are quick.</i>

1:44:02.244 --> 1:44:04.830
<i>Thus with a kiss...</i>

1:44:07.541 --> 1:44:09.627
<i>I die.</i>

1:44:27.353 --> 1:44:29.438
<i>Where is my lord?</i>

1:44:31.190 --> 1:44:35.319
<i>I do remember well where I should be,
and there I am. Where is my Romeo?</i>

1:44:35.402 --> 1:44:36.695
Dead!

1:44:50.084 --> 1:44:52.127
<i>What’s this?</i>

1:44:52.211 --> 1:44:55.923
<i>A cup, closed
in my true love’s hand?</i>

1:44:57.633 --> 1:45:01.303
<i>Poison, I see,hath been
his timeless end.</i>

1:45:06.976 --> 1:45:11.564
<i>Oh, happy dagger,
this is thy sheath.</i>

1:45:14.525 --> 1:45:16.902
<i>There rust...</i>

1:45:18.362 --> 1:45:20.573
<i>and let me die.</i>

1:45:27.496 --> 1:45:31.083
<i>A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.</i>

1:45:31.166 --> 1:45:35.588
<i>The sun for sorrow
will not show his head.</i>

1:45:35.671 --> 1:45:40.634
<i>Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.</i>

1:45:40.759 --> 1:45:42.970
<i>Some shall be pardoned...</i>

1:45:43.095 --> 1:45:46.098
<i>and some punished.</i>

1:45:46.182 --> 1:45:50.311
<i>For never was a story
of more woe...</i>

1:45:50.394 --> 1:45:53.981
<i>than this of Juliet...</i>

1:45:54.106 --> 1:45:56.317
<i>and her Romeo.</i>

1:46:23.469 --> 1:46:26.305
Bravo!

1:46:30.059 --> 1:46:32.019
-Yea! Yea!
-Yea!

1:47:18.440 --> 1:47:21.110
-Bravo!
-Yea! Bravo!

1:47:35.583 --> 1:47:40.004
-God save the queen!
-I arrest you in the name of Queen Elizabeth!

1:47:40.087 --> 1:47:44.091
Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?

1:47:44.175 --> 1:47:45.926
Everyone!

1:47:46.010 --> 1:47:49.346
Admiral’s Men,
the Chamberlain’s Men...

1:47:49.430 --> 1:47:53.767
and every one of you ne'er-do-wells
that stand in contempt...

1:47:53.851 --> 1:47:57.229
of the authority vested
in me by Her Majesty!

1:47:57.313 --> 1:48:01.358
Contempt? You closed the "Rose".
I have not opened it.

1:48:01.442 --> 1:48:03.944
That woman is a woman!

1:48:04.028 --> 1:48:06.113
What?

1:48:06.197 --> 1:48:09.408
A woman?
You mean that goat?

1:48:09.491 --> 1:48:14.914
I’ll see you all in Clink, in the name
of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth!

1:48:14.997 --> 1:48:18.334
Mr. Tilney!

1:48:23.547 --> 1:48:27.301
Have a care with my name.
You will wear it out.

1:48:35.142 --> 1:48:37.937
The queen of England
does not attend...

1:48:38.020 --> 1:48:40.064
exhibitions of public lewdness.

1:48:40.147 --> 1:48:43.150
So something is out of joint.

1:48:45.069 --> 1:48:48.739
Come here, Master Kent.
Let me look at you.

1:49:03.546 --> 1:49:06.465
Yes, the illusion is remarkable.

1:49:06.549 --> 1:49:09.260
And your error, Mr. Tilney,
is easily forgiven.

1:49:10.594 --> 1:49:14.598
But I know something of
a woman in a man’s profession.

1:49:14.682 --> 1:49:17.643
Yes, by God,
I do know about that.

1:49:19.395 --> 1:49:22.314
That is enough from you, Master Kent.

1:49:27.152 --> 1:49:29.405
If only Lord Wessex were here.

1:49:29.488 --> 1:49:31.532
He is, ma'am.

1:49:34.451 --> 1:49:37.663
Y-Your Majesty.

1:49:38.914 --> 1:49:41.917
There was a wager I remember...

1:49:42.001 --> 1:49:46.839
as to whether a play could show
the very truth and nature of love.

1:49:46.922 --> 1:49:49.508
I think you lost it today.

1:49:54.180 --> 1:49:58.100
You are an eager boy.
Did you like the play?

1:49:58.184 --> 1:50:01.103
I liked it when she stabbed herself,
Your Majesty.

1:50:07.776 --> 1:50:10.196
Master Shakespeare.

1:50:12.781 --> 1:50:15.784
Next time you come to Greenwich,
come as yourself...

1:50:15.868 --> 1:50:18.996
and we will speak some more.

1:50:36.472 --> 1:50:38.724
Your Majesty.

1:50:40.142 --> 1:50:44.730
Why, Lord Wessex.
Lost your wife so soon?

1:50:44.813 --> 1:50:47.566
Indeed I am a bride short...

1:50:47.650 --> 1:50:52.363
and my ship sails for the new world
on the evening tide.

1:50:52.738 --> 1:50:55.032
How is this to end?

1:50:55.074 --> 1:51:00.329
As stories must when love’s denied,
with tears and a journey.

1:51:01.288 --> 1:51:07.169
Those whom God has joined in marriage
not even I can put asunder.

1:51:07.378 --> 1:51:09.046
Master Kent.

1:51:14.760 --> 1:51:19.515
Lord Wessex, as I foretold,
has lost his wife in the playhouse.

1:51:20.683 --> 1:51:24.478
Go make your farewell
and send her out.

1:51:24.562 --> 1:51:27.022
It’s time to settle accounts.

1:51:29.650 --> 1:51:33.237
-How much was that wager?
-50 shillings.

1:51:34.572 --> 1:51:35.823
Pounds.

1:51:37.199 --> 1:51:41.662
Give it to Master Kent.
He will see it rightfully home.

1:51:49.253 --> 1:51:53.174
Tell Master Shakespeare
something more cheerful next time...

1:51:53.299 --> 1:51:56.135
for "Twelfth Night".

1:52:13.110 --> 1:52:15.613
Too late.
Too late.

1:52:25.497 --> 1:52:27.583
My Lady Wessex.

1:52:42.723 --> 1:52:45.726
A hired player no longer.

1:52:45.851 --> 1:52:51.023
50 pounds, Will,
for the poet of true love.

1:52:52.191 --> 1:52:54.568
I’m done with theater.

1:52:55.903 --> 1:53:00.991
The playhouse is for dreamers.
Look what the dream brought us.

1:53:02.159 --> 1:53:04.745
It was we ourselves did that.

1:53:06.163 --> 1:53:10.376
And for my life to come,
I would not have it otherwise.

1:53:10.501 --> 1:53:14.630
I have hurt you, and I’m sorry for it.

1:53:14.755 --> 1:53:18.801
If my hurt is to be
that you write no more...

1:53:18.884 --> 1:53:21.262
then I shall be the sorrier.

1:53:26.851 --> 1:53:29.395
The queen commands
a comedy, Will...

1:53:29.520 --> 1:53:34.608
-for "Twelfth Night".
-A comedy.

1:53:34.733 --> 1:53:36.735
What would my hero be?

1:53:36.777 --> 1:53:40.698
The saddest wretch in all the kingdom,
sick with love?

1:53:42.491 --> 1:53:45.953
It’s a beginning.

1:53:46.036 --> 1:53:50.124
Let him be a duke,
and your heroine...

1:53:50.207 --> 1:53:53.544
Sold in marriage
and halfway to America.

1:53:55.379 --> 1:53:59.592
At sea, then.
A voyage to a new world.

1:53:59.675 --> 1:54:02.553
A storm.
All are lost.

1:54:02.636 --> 1:54:06.098
She lands... on a...

1:54:06.182 --> 1:54:09.185
vast and empty shore.

1:54:10.644 --> 1:54:12.688
She’s brought to the duke...

1:54:14.106 --> 1:54:17.151
-Orsino.
-Orsino?

1:54:18.277 --> 1:54:20.196
Good name.

1:54:20.279 --> 1:54:26.243
But fearful of her virtue,
she comes to him dressed as a boy.

1:54:26.285 --> 1:54:29.622
And thus is unable
to declare her love.

1:54:30.789 --> 1:54:33.000
But all ends well.

1:54:33.083 --> 1:54:35.294
How does it?

1:54:36.086 --> 1:54:37.505
I don’t know.

1:54:39.089 --> 1:54:41.884
It’s a mystery.

1:54:48.807 --> 1:54:51.477
You will never age for me...

1:54:51.560 --> 1:54:55.105
nor fade, nor die.

1:54:56.148 --> 1:54:58.234
Nor you for me.

1:54:59.860 --> 1:55:02.154
Good-bye, my love.

1:55:03.072 --> 1:55:05.366
A thousand times good-bye.

1:55:10.538 --> 1:55:12.831
Write me well.

1:55:44.613 --> 1:55:48.242
My story starts at sea...

1:55:48.325 --> 1:55:52.246
a perilous voyage
to an unknown land.

1:55:52.955 --> 1:55:55.249
A shipwreck.

1:55:57.918 --> 1:56:01.714
The wild waters roar and heave.

1:56:02.923 --> 1:56:06.177
The brave vessel is dashed all to pieces...

1:56:08.929 --> 1:56:12.808
and all the helpless souls within her...

1:56:12.892 --> 1:56:14.977
drowned.

1:56:17.855 --> 1:56:21.150
All save one:

1:56:21.233 --> 1:56:23.319
a lady...

1:56:24.778 --> 1:56:27.865
whose soul is greater
than the ocean...

1:56:29.116 --> 1:56:34.038
and her spirit stronger
than the sea’s embrace.

1:56:35.706 --> 1:56:38.834
Not for her a watery end...

1:56:40.377 --> 1:56:45.174
but a new life beginning
on a stranger shore.

1:56:48.636 --> 1:56:51.138
It will be a love story,

1:56:55.267 --> 1:56:59.480
for she will be my heroine for all time.

1:57:02.316 --> 1:57:05.861
And her name will be Viola.
