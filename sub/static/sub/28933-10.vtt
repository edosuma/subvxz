Sam, come on in. Previously onInstinct...

00:03.786 --> 00:05.527
Will you be this baby's parents?

00:05.570 --> 00:08.051
Yes. Yes, yes,

00:08.095 --> 00:09.922
yes, a thousand times yes.[chuckles]

00:09.966 --> 00:12.969
I think your case may
be related to a murder

00:13.013 --> 00:15.841
I'm investigating
in Garfield.The Sleeping Beauties case.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.321
I'm gonna catch
whoever did this.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.149
I'm here. You got
no more room to run.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.064
He's gonna get himself killed.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.587
Man up!You sorry son of a--

00:23.588 --> 00:25.112
[grunts]

00:27.244 --> 00:28.985
MAYA: You can't speak
about this to anyone.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.639
Not even Dylan Reinhart.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.858
Given his father's
position at the CIA,

00:32.902 --> 00:34.860
Mr. Reinhart may be compromised.

00:34.904 --> 00:37.080
Your dad's here.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.821
Chatter has it that
Julian Cousins

00:38.864 --> 00:40.344
is being paid
handsomely to compromise

00:40.388 --> 00:42.607
the city's first
responder network.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.957
Julian is many things,
but he is not a traitor.

00:45.001 --> 00:46.263
Right.

00:46.307 --> 00:49.005
I thought
you should know.

01:03.585 --> 01:05.065
[exhales]

01:07.763 --> 01:09.112
Julian?

01:09.156 --> 01:11.027
Trust me, I'm as confused
as you are.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.637
I have no idea why I'm here,

01:12.681 --> 01:14.161
wearing a pinstripe suit,

01:14.204 --> 01:15.640
or reading
the Business section.

01:15.684 --> 01:17.860
It's because
you're supposed to be my dad.

01:17.903 --> 01:20.993
He always appears to me in
a nightmare after he visits.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.604
Ah.

01:22.647 --> 01:25.346
Then your father must have
said something about me.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.739
Something unsettling?

01:27.783 --> 01:30.177
He believes you've...

01:30.220 --> 01:31.613
betrayed me.

01:31.656 --> 01:34.006
And we both know how
susceptible you are to betrayal.

01:34.050 --> 01:37.532
Especially with people
you work with.

01:38.576 --> 01:41.318
Thankfully, the worst
of them are dead.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.799
But me?

01:45.801 --> 01:47.977
Why would I ever want
to betray you?

01:48.020 --> 01:49.761
That's the question.

02:00.207 --> 02:01.382
Why are you up so early?

02:02.426 --> 02:04.689
Um...

02:04.733 --> 02:06.604
Just doing some research.
How about you?

02:06.648 --> 02:08.737
I never sleep well
after my dad visits.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.566
Researching what?
Uh...

02:13.133 --> 02:14.656
All right, Sam
comes back from

02:14.699 --> 02:16.745
seeing her parents
in Sacramento today.I-I thought

02:16.788 --> 02:18.660
they were supportive.
Aren't they supportive?

02:18.703 --> 02:20.444
D-Didn't they
want to meet us?
They do.

02:20.488 --> 02:23.404
But she has asked if we could
reach out to the baby's bio-dad.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.057
Why? Didn't he
flee back to Germany,

02:25.101 --> 02:26.450
ignoring her and the baby?

02:26.494 --> 02:28.191
He still has legal rights,
as do we.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.672
And there's the
morality of it all.
I...

02:30.715 --> 02:32.282
He jumped on a plane the second
Sam told him the news.

02:32.326 --> 02:34.110
I think he relinquished
all moral claims.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.634
I know you're worried.I'm not worried.
I'm terrified.

02:38.288 --> 02:40.595
This whole adoption
could go wrong in so many ways,

02:40.638 --> 02:43.163
and I have
so much happiness already.

02:43.206 --> 02:46.166
You, our life,
o-our careers.

02:46.209 --> 02:49.517
And-and now,
to now ask for more... [exhales]

02:49.560 --> 02:51.345
Is that why
Lizzie's the only one

02:51.388 --> 02:53.216
you've told we're having a baby?

02:53.260 --> 02:55.827
I wanted to tell the whole
precinct, but I just...

02:57.873 --> 03:01.050
...don't know if I can trust
the universe.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.009
Then trust me.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.186
Everything is fine.

I just-- I thought
we could, um,

03:25.727 --> 03:28.208
bake a cake when we meet
Sam's parents, so that's...

03:28.251 --> 03:29.470
Oh.[phone buzzing]

03:33.082 --> 03:35.911
Ooh, go to go.All right.

03:43.962 --> 03:46.226
Ah-ha.
So we are working.

03:46.269 --> 03:48.184
When I got a text
saying to meet

03:48.228 --> 03:50.273
at Old Man Bill's Brewery,
I worried you were

03:50.317 --> 03:51.274
starting a
little early.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.362
Mm, you worry too much.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.190
Mm, so I've heard.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.365
"Trust the universe."

03:55.409 --> 03:56.975
Well, this morning,

03:57.019 --> 03:59.195
the universe brought us
multiple gunshots.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.370
The victims all worked here.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.763
All?

04:01.806 --> 04:04.156
You guys are gonna want
to put these on.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.334
It's okay,
they go with the coat.

04:10.902 --> 04:13.209
Beat cop responded
to shots fired at 4:20.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.602
Arrived to find
the loading door open

04:14.645 --> 04:16.299
and these two already dead.

04:16.343 --> 04:17.779
He recognized them from his beat

04:17.822 --> 04:18.693
as owner-operators
of the brewery.

04:18.736 --> 04:19.650
That's our shooter?

04:19.694 --> 04:22.262

Hey, watch your step here, guys.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.833
Thanks.

04:28.877 --> 04:31.183
Yeah, looks like a stray round
punctured this tank.

04:31.227 --> 04:33.360
ESU doesn't want to dive in
there, I got a buddy in

volunteer

04:34.622 --> 04:36.276
to drink his way to the bottom.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.321
Sorry, but if it's a nice hoppy
amber, we're gonna

to the mouth and head.

But this one.

05:02.737 --> 05:05.348
Louis. I answered
a few domestics on him.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.350
The mom begged me
not to lock him up,

05:07.394 --> 05:09.613
but I did have to bring
him in one time on

05:09.657 --> 05:11.398

and others," so...

05:11.441 --> 05:12.616
And who are these two?

05:12.660 --> 05:14.314
The other partners.

05:14.357 --> 05:15.576
The brewmaster, Samar,
he's on his way

05:15.619 --> 05:17.404
back from a hop farm
in Rhode Island.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.623
And next to him,
Gretchen's daughter Angela

05:19.667 --> 05:22.844
who arrived just after me.
She's in the tap room now.

05:22.887 --> 05:25.237
There's a woman here
who just lost her brother,

05:25.281 --> 05:27.327
her mother and her husband?

05:30.765 --> 05:33.550
That door should not
have been open.

05:33.594 --> 05:35.335
It's Tuesday.

05:35.378 --> 05:38.076
We don't deliver kegs
on Tuesdays.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.426
Was it customary
for your mom and husband

05:39.469 --> 05:42.603
to get here so early?No.

05:42.646 --> 05:45.519
We decided last night to tap
a limited edition.

Samar asked us to wait, but...

05:50.437 --> 05:51.655
we had this group
coming through today--

05:51.699 --> 05:54.266
Bert, we need to cancel
that tour bus.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.356
Yeah, done.
All right.

The reverend's here
to take you home

05:58.183 --> 06:00.360
when you're ready.Just a couple more
questions, please.

06:00.403 --> 06:01.839
Was your brother Louis

06:01.883 --> 06:04.189
here to help
with the tasting?No.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.409
Louis didn't drink.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.585
He worked nights,
hosing down the tanks.

06:08.629 --> 06:12.328
Did you noticed any unusual
behavior from Louis recently?

06:12.372 --> 06:13.851

or messages?

[scoffs] No.

06:16.158 --> 06:18.334
What are you...?

06:18.378 --> 06:19.770

too, wasn't he?

06:19.814 --> 06:21.555
We're just trying to understand

06:21.598 --> 06:23.339
so we can help you
get some answers.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.428
You can go.
Thank you.

06:25.472 --> 06:26.560
We'll be in touch.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.565
We need to figure out if

06:31.608 --> 06:33.654
this was family-related
or business-related.

06:33.697 --> 06:34.872
Mm-hmm.You're the bookkeeper,
right?

06:34.916 --> 06:38.006
Uh, and just bartender
and o-other stuff.

06:38.049 --> 06:39.442
We'll need access
to the company's books.

06:39.486 --> 06:41.879
All right, I'll check,
but I'm sure Samar and Angela

06:41.923 --> 06:44.099
will want to cooperate.

06:44.142 --> 06:46.623
[sharp exhale]
I can't believe Louis had a gun.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.147
It was him, wasn't it?

06:49.191 --> 06:50.975
Why would you say that?

06:51.019 --> 06:52.499
I don't know.

06:52.542 --> 06:55.023
I-- Louis was weird.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.372
He hated Phil
for getting their mom

06:56.416 --> 06:57.678
to risk her nest egg
on a brewery.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.897
The building
was Gretchen's?

06:59.941 --> 07:02.509
Used to be her late husband
Bill's upholstery shop.

07:02.552 --> 07:04.728
But even after it was a success,

07:04.772 --> 07:06.556
Louis resented
that they made their money

07:06.600 --> 07:09.298
on alcohol, said it ruined
his father's good name.

07:09.341 --> 07:11.387
And yet he worked here.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.389
That was all Gretchen.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.738
She supported both her kids.

07:14.782 --> 07:16.566
Louis couldn't hold a job.

Always needed money.
She kept him busy and involved.

07:20.222 --> 07:21.353
I thought it was admirable.

07:21.397 --> 07:22.920
But maybe...

07:22.964 --> 07:24.531
It was a mistake?

07:24.574 --> 07:26.358
Yeah.

07:30.101 --> 07:32.495
So the mother and son-in-law
were shot entering the space?

07:32.539 --> 07:34.541
That's our
working premise.

indicates no signs of violent
tendencies toward others.

that Louis possessed a gun

08:52.749 --> 08:54.925

08:54.969 --> 08:56.274
or even visited
a shooting range,

20:37.932 --> 20:39.412
I have a bad feeling
about this.
So do I.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.501
Samar could've as
easily been buying guns

20:41.544 --> 20:42.850
in Virginia as hopping
in Rhode Island.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.765
So the brewery was a front?

20:44.808 --> 20:47.376
Anyone seen Stock?What's the problem now?

20:47.420 --> 20:49.030
He wrote his report by hand.

20:49.073 --> 20:50.684
Well, maybe because
his handwriting

20:50.727 --> 20:52.860
is actually legible. Yours looks
like you write with your foot,

20:52.903 --> 20:54.078
like that genius baboon.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.950
Yeah, real funny.
If you see him,

20:55.993 --> 20:57.299
tell him to use my computer,

20:57.343 --> 20:59.040
but not to look
at my search history.

20:59.083 --> 21:02.043
I think Ryan's
handwriting's fine.

21:02.086 --> 21:04.306
Yeah. Said the man wearing
glasses as thick as a meatloaf.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.743
It does have the over-confidence

21:06.787 --> 21:08.484
of a single child
with a doting mother.

21:08.528 --> 21:11.008
Yeah, funny.
I thought the same thing.

21:11.052 --> 21:12.923
Look, just tell Stock
to get it right.

21:15.622 --> 21:18.581
I think Fucci's suffering
from separation anxiety.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.149
Yeah, that DD5 is turning into
their "give-bye."

21:21.192 --> 21:23.456
Their what?
Never mind.

21:23.499 --> 21:26.372
The brewery's accounting books
show a very profitable business.

21:26.415 --> 21:28.330
So why risk it
by trafficking guns?

21:28.374 --> 21:29.810
Some people just can't
be honest.

21:29.853 --> 21:32.552
I guess honesty's
too boring for them.

21:32.595 --> 21:34.118
Okay, that makes no sense.

21:34.162 --> 21:37.513
What's going on?
Nothing.

21:37.557 --> 21:38.775
Here's something strange...Just stop that.

21:38.819 --> 21:40.516
You've been tossing out attitude

21:40.560 --> 21:41.691
and hiding in your work
all morning.

21:41.735 --> 21:44.477
I could spare you
the psychoanalysis

21:44.520 --> 21:47.741
if you'd just tell me what
is making you so mad.

21:47.784 --> 21:49.743
I'm not mad. I'm--

21:49.786 --> 21:51.571
I'm upset.
Why?

21:51.614 --> 21:54.487
With myself, about Julian.

21:54.530 --> 21:55.705
Why?

21:57.446 --> 21:59.622
All that top-secret spy crap.

21:59.666 --> 22:01.494
[British accent]: "Oh, I can't
disclose where I've been."

22:01.537 --> 22:05.324
Turns out the reason was
a total cliché.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.369
There's another woman.

22:07.413 --> 22:10.416
Oh, I don't believe that.Well, then,

22:10.459 --> 22:12.896
he certainly wasted no time
finding a gorgeous brunette

22:12.940 --> 22:14.333
right after we broke up.

22:14.376 --> 22:17.379
Where did you see this
gorgeous brunette?

22:17.423 --> 22:19.512
In the park this morning.

22:19.555 --> 22:21.340
Could it have been that singer
we saw a few weeks ago

22:21.383 --> 22:23.124
at the Bellmark Hotel?

22:23.167 --> 22:24.255
Who?
Maya. Remember?

22:24.299 --> 22:25.561
I told you I knew her
from the past?

22:25.605 --> 22:27.433
Oh.

22:27.476 --> 22:29.130
I don't know,
it might have been her.

22:29.173 --> 22:30.392
I didn't see her face.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.263
Might she own a pair
of Chanel sunglasses?

22:32.307 --> 22:34.440
Oh, yes, absolutely.
She has very expensive taste.

22:34.483 --> 22:35.876
Maya also works
in intelligence.

22:35.919 --> 22:38.618
If they were together,
it was for business.

22:38.661 --> 22:41.185
Julian did not betray you.
I'm sure of that much.

22:41.229 --> 22:43.840
Why say it like that?
Would he betray you?

22:45.625 --> 22:48.062
Come on, you can do it.
It's called give-and-take.

22:48.105 --> 22:52.632
N-No. I don't think Julian
would betray me, but...

22:52.675 --> 22:54.460
what's he up to?

22:54.503 --> 22:56.636
Where's he been?
Something's going on.

22:56.679 --> 22:59.682
Maybe neither of us
really knows him.

22:59.726 --> 23:01.641
He never lied to me.

23:01.684 --> 23:03.773
Not about anything
that mattered.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.862
And I'm sure
he didn't lie to you.

23:07.603 --> 23:09.649
Thank you for that.

23:11.302 --> 23:13.261
Now, can I please go back
to hiding in my work?

23:13.304 --> 23:14.654
Oh, I wish you would.

23:14.697 --> 23:16.699
Okay, I was right.

23:16.743 --> 23:18.179
On the first of every month,

23:18.222 --> 23:19.659
there is a thousand-dollar
cash withdrawal

23:19.702 --> 23:21.008
from the brewery's books.

23:21.051 --> 23:24.098
And it goes back for years.

23:24.141 --> 23:26.622
All memoed "TRP."

23:29.277 --> 23:31.192
But it stopped two months ago.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.715
Should we bring in Samar?

23:32.759 --> 23:35.022
No. Let's visit
the bookkeeper first.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.069
Thanks for meeting me here.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.723
I didn't want to leave
Angela alone.

23:40.767 --> 23:41.985
Of course.
Yeah.

23:42.029 --> 23:43.683
I was aware of those
cash withdrawals.

23:43.726 --> 23:46.033
I'd forgotten all about them.What were they for?

23:46.076 --> 23:48.557
It was Gretchen's thing,
Uh, Angela's mom.

23:48.601 --> 23:49.776
She'd been secretive
about it,

23:49.819 --> 23:51.604
but a couple months ago,
I got her to admit

23:51.647 --> 23:53.432
she was paying protection money.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.608
It was something
her late husband had done

23:55.651 --> 23:57.610
when the business was his.

24:00.177 --> 24:03.529
Detectives, thank you
for all you're doing.

24:03.572 --> 24:06.314
I'm thinking brushed aluminum
for Phil,

24:06.357 --> 24:07.663
and the high-gloss rose
for Mama,

24:07.707 --> 24:09.796
but I don't know
about Louis.

24:09.839 --> 24:12.146
[scoffs] He'd want
the cheapest one, but...

24:12.189 --> 24:15.236
would that look right?

24:17.281 --> 24:19.893
Why don't you show me
what you've picked?

24:19.936 --> 24:20.981
I'm so sorry you
have to do this.

24:21.024 --> 24:23.244
Thank you.

24:23.287 --> 24:24.811
Who was
Gretchen paying?

24:24.854 --> 24:25.899
Who's TRP?

24:25.942 --> 24:27.944
That was her code.
I have no idea.

24:27.988 --> 24:29.685
And why did the payments stop
two months ago?

24:29.729 --> 24:32.296
I convinced Gretchen that amount
was so out-of-date,

24:32.340 --> 24:34.864
she probably wasn't getting
anything for her money.

24:34.908 --> 24:37.780
I hope I wasn't wrong.

24:39.129 --> 24:41.088
Yeah, that sounds
like Gretchen.

24:41.131 --> 24:42.872
She's probably still paying
for a landline, too,

24:42.916 --> 24:44.091
just because
Bill always had.

24:44.134 --> 24:46.354
You don't know of any
protection rackets

24:46.397 --> 24:47.486
in the neighborhood?

24:47.529 --> 24:49.488
If there is one,
it'd be long-standing

24:49.531 --> 24:50.837
and deeply hidden.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.665
Ever hear of any gun
trafficking on your beat?

24:52.708 --> 24:55.145
No. I mean, in the past, maybe,

24:55.189 --> 24:56.538
but all that kind of stuff
has moved out.

24:56.582 --> 24:57.800
There's too much legit money
being made.

24:57.844 --> 25:00.150
Any idea why "TRP"

25:00.194 --> 25:01.761
would have been noted
with Gretchen's payments?

25:01.804 --> 25:04.503
Off the top of my head,
I'd say Tony R.

25:04.546 --> 25:05.852
He owns Tony's Pizzeria.

25:05.895 --> 25:07.331
I mean, that
guy's old school.

25:07.375 --> 25:08.550
Could still
be connected.

25:08.594 --> 25:09.899
I mean, he did time for mob hits

25:09.943 --> 25:11.074
back in the day.

25:11.118 --> 25:13.424
Man, look at all these Tony Rs

25:13.468 --> 25:15.296
with pizzerias
who have rap sheets.

25:15.339 --> 25:17.211
You're stereotyping.

25:17.254 --> 25:18.604
No, I'm getting carpal tunnel.

25:18.647 --> 25:19.996
Well, let me drive.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.521
If you touch my keyboard,
I will break your hand.

25:22.564 --> 25:23.739
LIZZIE: How's that
for a stereotype?

25:23.783 --> 25:25.393
Hey, how's it going?Uh, it's not.

25:25.436 --> 25:28.091
Something's wrong with this
access code that you gave me.

25:28.135 --> 25:31.225
There's nothing wrong.
It's a fickle system. Try again.

25:31.268 --> 25:33.270
"CELTICSSUCK."
Two S's, all caps, one word.

25:33.314 --> 25:36.317
...suck...

25:36.360 --> 25:39.407
Again, invalid. Do you have
a temp code or something?

25:39.450 --> 25:40.626
Yeah, I'll get you one
as soon as I get back

25:40.669 --> 25:42.236
from this deposition.

25:42.279 --> 25:44.455
In the meantime, take a break,
grab yourself a bagel, you know.

25:44.499 --> 25:45.935
And just think,

25:45.979 --> 25:47.850
two months ago you didn't even
know what a bagel was.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.591
Get out of here.

25:49.635 --> 25:50.940
DYLAN: Hey, did you
have a chance to...

25:50.984 --> 25:52.507
ZACK: Oh. Oh, yeah.
I just finished the scan.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.074
And from what I can tell,
there's no evidence

25:54.117 --> 25:55.684
of any bot or malignant malware
in the precinct's system.

25:55.728 --> 25:57.164
Thanks.

25:57.207 --> 25:58.600
However, there was one odd thing

25:58.644 --> 26:00.080
I couldn't account for.

26:00.123 --> 26:02.299
What's that?It looks like a glitch
might have shut down

26:02.343 --> 26:04.040
the system's firewall
for a few minutes yesterday.

26:04.084 --> 26:06.042
Huh.

26:06.086 --> 26:09.698
Julian, it's me. Again.

26:09.742 --> 26:12.440
I've sent out the bat signal,
twice.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.703
I obviously need to talk.

26:14.747 --> 26:17.184
Stop avoiding me.

26:25.105 --> 26:28.499
So, if Tony is still associated
with the Genovese family,

26:28.543 --> 26:31.024
he's been savvy enough
to keep a low profile

26:31.067 --> 26:32.591
since being paroled in the '90s.

26:32.634 --> 26:35.985
I must admit, I'm fascinated
by the ethos of organized crime.

26:36.029 --> 26:38.292
Its pathology is cloaked
in traditions akin

26:38.335 --> 26:40.555
to religious beliefs
or patriotism;

26:40.599 --> 26:43.863
a code that justifies behavior
as protective morality.

26:43.906 --> 26:45.734
So, maybe you sit back
and be fascinated,

26:45.778 --> 26:47.214
and let me ask the questions.

26:47.257 --> 26:49.042
I wouldn't want you
to piss him off and wake up

26:49.085 --> 26:51.000
with a severed horse head
beside you.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.480
Oh, please.

26:52.523 --> 26:55.004
I've already woken up to one
disturbing sight this week.

26:57.485 --> 27:01.010
We have some questions.

27:01.054 --> 27:03.056
Haven't seen one of those
lately, Detective.

27:03.099 --> 27:04.927
Trying to take me back
to the old days?

27:04.971 --> 27:07.887
Is Gretchen DeVaire and the
brewery part of the old days?

27:07.930 --> 27:09.497
Yeah, I heard about that.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.325
What a shame.

27:11.368 --> 27:13.544
And yet you extorted
money from her.

27:13.588 --> 27:15.155
She paid, I received,

27:15.198 --> 27:18.071
even though I don't have the
muscle to back it up anymore.

27:18.114 --> 27:20.900
It was more of a nostalgia
thing, in memory of Bill.

27:20.943 --> 27:22.075
Oh, how nice of you.

27:22.118 --> 27:23.946
Any other charities
you run out of here?

27:23.990 --> 27:25.208
Eh, it's ancient history.

27:25.252 --> 27:27.907
Yeah, I used to place
a few bets for folks.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.386
I know where you're going
with this.

27:29.430 --> 27:32.955
I never took money from Louis,
even though he begged.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.130
Why would he beg?

27:34.174 --> 27:36.437
Kid was bad with money,
always in debt.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.700
Besides, all the gambling's
moved online.

27:38.744 --> 27:41.007
You know that.

27:41.050 --> 27:43.531
This is what I like, face
to face, like we're doing.

27:43.574 --> 27:46.969
You come here, look me
in the eye; I respect this.

27:47.013 --> 27:50.059
And I respect an ex-bookie,
if he is not a murderer.

27:50.103 --> 27:52.192
[scoffs]
Aw, come on. Look at me.

27:52.235 --> 27:53.759
I can hardly toss dough.

27:53.802 --> 27:57.066
And these days, I make more
selling gluten-free pies.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.155
Can I offer you a slice?
I grow the basil myself.

27:59.199 --> 28:01.767
Well, in that case...No, thank you.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.812
Any idea who traffics guns
in the neighborhood?

28:03.856 --> 28:06.728
Could have told you
ten years ago, but I won't.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.338
I'm not a snitch.

28:08.382 --> 28:10.079
Did six years for
shutting my mouth.

28:10.123 --> 28:12.647
Nowadays, there's no room
for the little guy.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.649
It's all vertical integration.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.999
Whatever corporate entity
took over trafficking,

28:17.043 --> 28:19.175
they know how to
cover their tracks.

28:19.219 --> 28:21.656
C'est la vie.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.049
C'est la guèrre.

28:23.092 --> 28:26.792
LIZZIE:
Well, for a former kneecapper,

28:26.835 --> 28:28.881
Tony was pretty charming.

28:28.924 --> 28:30.970
Eh, charm is a hallmark
of sociopathy.

28:31.013 --> 28:32.580
Some of the most engaging
people are masking

28:32.623 --> 28:34.364
a deeply disturbed psyche.

28:34.408 --> 28:37.324
You don't say?
Yes, I do say.

28:37.367 --> 28:39.152
Let's see how Tony's
story checks out.[phone buzzes]

28:39.195 --> 28:41.502
You okay?

28:41.545 --> 28:43.591
Uh, no.

28:43.634 --> 28:45.071
Um, it's my dog walker.

28:45.114 --> 28:47.377
Gary keeps barfing up
his flea meds.

28:47.421 --> 28:49.466
Do you mind if I meet you
back at the precinct?
Sure.

28:49.510 --> 28:52.165
It's not a puzzle.
Use your teeth.

29:09.530 --> 29:14.056
I don't know what's weirder,
that you're day-drinking,

29:14.100 --> 29:16.102
or that you're day-drinking
in someone else's bar.

29:16.145 --> 29:18.365
Please tell me Dylan
has no idea we're meeting.

29:18.408 --> 29:19.496
He didn't ask where
you were going, right?

29:19.540 --> 29:20.889
He's not suspicious
about tonight?

29:20.933 --> 29:22.412
No, Andy, calm down.

29:22.456 --> 29:25.111
He has no idea about
the surprise party.

29:25.154 --> 29:26.677
We may have to cancel.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.244
What?Something happened today--

29:28.288 --> 29:30.246
Well, actually,
two things happened today.

29:30.290 --> 29:33.075
I...Okay, can you start
from the beginning?

29:33.119 --> 29:36.383
Because your text made no sense,
and you're clearly freaking out.

29:36.426 --> 29:37.776
Oh, completely.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.647
Also, my fingers are kind of
like breakfast sausages,

29:39.690 --> 29:42.911
so they tend to overwhelm
autocorrect.

29:45.218 --> 29:47.133
Dylan is really anxious
about this adoption, okay?

29:47.176 --> 29:49.178
He-he's been waiting for
the other shoe to drop.

29:49.222 --> 29:52.225
And then today, I realized
he may be right.

29:52.268 --> 29:54.096
What's this?

29:54.140 --> 29:56.011
It's an e-mail
from an attorney.

29:56.055 --> 29:57.273
The bio-dad's attorney.

29:57.317 --> 29:59.667
You know German?I had it translated.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.147
It's a total shakedown.

30:01.190 --> 30:03.149
He wants money to sign off
his client's parental rights.

30:03.192 --> 30:06.065
I-I mean, we may be able to buy
this bastard off this time,

30:06.108 --> 30:08.415
but if we set the precedent...Andy, stop.

30:08.458 --> 30:10.634
You're not acting
like an attorney.

30:10.678 --> 30:11.853
The attorney I know you to be.

30:11.897 --> 30:14.203
The one who saved my ass
not too long ago.

30:14.247 --> 30:15.204
Remember what you told me?

30:15.248 --> 30:18.077
Every lawyer's opening salvo

30:18.120 --> 30:19.208
is meant to instill fear.

30:19.252 --> 30:21.210
You need to be your own lawyer.

30:21.254 --> 30:24.039
Calm down, and start
representing yourself.

30:24.083 --> 30:25.867
You are exactly right.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.303
Yeah, of course I am.
So get it together,

30:27.347 --> 30:29.088
outmaneuver the guy,
and do it fast.

30:29.131 --> 30:30.654
The caterers arrive
in 30 minutes.

30:30.698 --> 30:33.266
Oh, my God, no wonder Dylan
loves working with you so much.

30:33.309 --> 30:36.269
Oh, please, he never lets me
tell him what to do.

30:36.312 --> 30:38.445
I like you so much better.
So, what's the second thing?

30:38.488 --> 30:40.142
You said two
things happened.

30:40.186 --> 30:42.188
Let's solve the
other one right now.

30:43.450 --> 30:44.843
Okay.

30:47.149 --> 30:49.238
So, I just saw Andy.
We're all good for tonight.

30:49.282 --> 30:50.674
Don't be late.Uh-huh.

30:50.718 --> 30:53.199
JASMINE:
Great. Seriously,
I need the "I"s dotted

30:53.242 --> 30:54.809
and the "T"s crossed
on this case.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.724
Okay. Don't worry,
Lou, I'm on it.

30:58.944 --> 31:01.163
Is your pup okay?
Huh? Yes.

31:01.207 --> 31:02.686
Yeah, fine. Thanks.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.514
Report came in
from Ballistics.

31:04.558 --> 31:06.995
Our gun matches rounds fired at
a gang shooting last spring.

31:07.039 --> 31:09.868
Eyewitness said the bangers
were in the middle

31:09.911 --> 31:12.609
of a weapons purchase.Well, look what I pulled up.

31:12.653 --> 31:14.350
Tony is right.

31:14.394 --> 31:16.048
There were multiple gun
traffickers busted

31:16.091 --> 31:18.398
over the last few years
in this area.

31:18.441 --> 31:21.096
So, if Tony's still active,
it could have been a turf war,

31:21.140 --> 31:22.750
or Samar had taken over...

31:22.793 --> 31:27.711
Hang on. The responding officer
in most of those busts? McColl.

31:27.755 --> 31:30.323
Our beat cop?
He didn't mention that.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.936
No way one of our own
could have done this.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.025
Wait, wait. Just think about it.

31:37.069 --> 31:38.157
First guy on the scene,

31:38.200 --> 31:40.463
first guy to say suicide,

31:40.507 --> 31:42.857
only guy to paint Louis
as violent.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.685
Oh. This-- It's unthinkable.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.208
Betrayal always is.

31:46.252 --> 31:48.297
What about the gang death
with matching ballistics?

31:48.341 --> 31:50.386
McColl wasn't the..."Responding officer...

31:50.430 --> 31:52.214
McColl."

31:52.258 --> 31:54.173
Damn.

31:54.216 --> 31:56.131
If McColl is dirty,

31:56.175 --> 31:58.786
then he's relying
on out-of-state drivers, he--

31:58.829 --> 32:00.614
And he never moved up.
He never crowed

32:00.657 --> 32:02.268
about his busts like
other cops I know.

32:02.311 --> 32:04.531
Yeah, because he wasn't just
busting criminals.

32:04.574 --> 32:07.186
He was eliminating
his competition.

32:07.229 --> 32:09.579
Cunning, manipulative traitor.

32:09.623 --> 32:11.016
We're never gonna get
Internal Affairs

32:11.059 --> 32:13.496
to pursue this on a hunch,
so we need

32:13.540 --> 32:15.194
to press CSU on
those van prints

32:15.237 --> 32:17.196
and see if our friends in
Virginia have any leads.

32:17.239 --> 32:18.501
You know, we may already have
tipped our hand

32:18.545 --> 32:19.763
when we went to see him.

32:19.807 --> 32:21.287
If McColl is half as ruthless

32:21.330 --> 32:23.463
as he seems, he may already
have covered his tracks.

32:30.557 --> 32:32.907
Don't even think about it.Hold it right there.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.213
LIZZIE:
IAB is right here.

32:34.256 --> 32:35.605
Sean McColl,
you are under arrest

32:35.649 --> 32:36.998
for the murders
of Gretchen DeVaire,

32:37.042 --> 32:38.826
Louis DeVaire

32:38.869 --> 32:40.001
and Phil Shaw.

32:40.045 --> 32:41.307
You have the right
to remain silent.

32:41.350 --> 32:42.047
This is bull.

32:42.090 --> 32:43.178
Actually, it's airtight.

32:43.222 --> 32:44.092
Especially after

32:44.136 --> 32:45.746
the testimony of your van driver

32:45.789 --> 32:47.269
who was just picked
up in Arlington.

32:47.313 --> 32:49.968
That dude can't talk
fast enough.

32:50.011 --> 32:52.057
He did not sign on
for murder one.

You cut a deal with Louis
to use the brewery

32:56.061 --> 32:57.497
after hours to receive
the illegal guns.

32:57.540 --> 33:01.022
But Louis, bad with money,
needed more.

33:01.066 --> 33:02.676
He threatened to expose you.

33:02.719 --> 33:04.634
[gunshot]

33:04.678 --> 33:07.507
LIZZIE:
Unfortunately, Gretchen
and Phil came in early.

33:10.597 --> 33:12.555
You knew, with Louis's history,

33:12.599 --> 33:14.731
you could get away
with staging a suicide.

33:14.775 --> 33:16.559
So you needed to frame Louis

33:16.603 --> 33:18.779
and dirty the scene
with some wild shots.

33:23.131 --> 33:25.046
[engine starts]

33:27.701 --> 33:30.530
Too bad you hit your supplier's
gas tank in the process.

33:30.573 --> 33:32.662
You disgraced our uniform.

33:40.105 --> 33:42.933

33:42.977 --> 33:45.023
Thanks for letting
me hang with you.

really got to me.

What's his diagnosis?

33:48.026 --> 33:49.462
Oh, um...

smelled money.

in addition to sharing
our news with our friends,

this party could also be

What were you celebrating?

38:20.515 --> 38:21.516
Why don't you tell
me what's going on?

38:21.560 --> 38:23.953
Start with Maya Bhaduri.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.738
Why did you keep me in the dark?

38:25.781 --> 38:28.915
Haven't you been insisting
I keep you out of the spy world?

38:28.958 --> 38:30.438
Fair point.

38:30.482 --> 38:32.701
But since you've been
in the precinct,

38:32.745 --> 38:34.094
I've been pulled back in.

38:34.137 --> 38:36.096
Someone in the agency
reached out to you.

38:36.139 --> 38:37.358
Was it your father?

38:37.402 --> 38:39.578
That means "yes."

38:39.621 --> 38:44.322
Maya says the CIA is
compromised on this...

38:44.365 --> 38:45.714
or there's a leak.

38:45.758 --> 38:49.283
That's why MI6 preferred
to work with me.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.154
I'm listening.

38:51.198 --> 38:52.852
While I've been trying
to smoke out

38:52.895 --> 38:55.289
those infiltrating
the NYPD's computers,

38:55.333 --> 38:58.205
Maya was in position to identify
the group responsible.

38:58.248 --> 38:59.424
Smoke out, how?

38:59.467 --> 39:02.165
I shut down
the NYPD's firewall briefly,

39:02.209 --> 39:03.993
as proof of my control.Proof to whom?

39:04.037 --> 39:05.386
Maya doesn't know,

39:05.430 --> 39:07.257
but she does have
some theories.

39:07.301 --> 39:09.390
She even mentioned Pasternak.

39:12.132 --> 39:13.307
Pasternak is dead.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.179
[quietly]:
I killed him.

39:16.223 --> 39:17.398
You were there.

39:17.442 --> 39:18.399
We watched him die.

39:18.443 --> 39:20.793
I know.

39:20.836 --> 39:22.447
But Pasternak could have
trained someone else;

39:22.490 --> 39:25.363
targeting first responders
would be just like him.

39:25.406 --> 39:27.103
I hate to think
his poison lives on.

39:27.147 --> 39:29.279
Well...

39:29.323 --> 39:31.543
Maya should be waiting
in my room by now,

39:31.586 --> 39:34.110
and she can vouch for me

39:34.154 --> 39:36.112
if you still have
any doubts.That won't be necessary.

39:37.244 --> 39:38.288
But I would like
to say hello;

39:38.332 --> 39:40.334
it's been a while.

39:41.683 --> 39:43.685
I live in a different world now,
Julian.

39:44.512 --> 39:46.732
Andy and I are adopting a baby,

39:46.775 --> 39:48.429
a boy.

39:48.473 --> 39:49.822
We found out tonight.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.919
[lock clicks]JULIAN:
Maya.

39:59.962 --> 40:02.138
Maya. No.

40:03.749 --> 40:05.403
No.

40:06.360 --> 40:09.058
It's too late.

40:09.102 --> 40:10.190
She's gone.

40:12.801 --> 40:14.150
No blood, no bruising.

40:15.500 --> 40:18.372
Injection site?Careful.

40:18.416 --> 40:21.854
If it's a nerve agent, we don't
know how it's transmitted.

40:23.159 --> 40:25.335
She texted me 45 minutes ago.

40:25.379 --> 40:26.641
She must have
needed my help.

40:26.685 --> 40:27.947
[sighs]

40:27.990 --> 40:30.079
I'll call my contact
at the British consulate.

40:30.123 --> 40:32.081
I still have
contacts there.

40:32.125 --> 40:33.692
This is your room. If
someone's trying to frame you,

40:33.735 --> 40:35.650
you should leave.

40:35.694 --> 40:40.263
James, it's
Dylan Reinhart.

40:40.307 --> 40:41.395
I'm calling about
one of yours.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.310
Yes, unfortunately.

40:43.353 --> 40:44.529
At the Olmstead.

40:44.572 --> 40:46.661
Maya Bhaduri.

40:46.705 --> 40:48.097
What?

40:49.142 --> 40:50.186
I see.

40:51.361 --> 40:54.103
Thank you.

40:54.147 --> 40:55.714
They're sending their coroner,
but something's off.

40:55.757 --> 40:58.020
Maya was only working
for the British

40:58.064 --> 40:59.369
as a "passive collector."

40:59.413 --> 41:00.719
What?
She provided
information

41:00.762 --> 41:02.242
from time to time,

41:02.285 --> 41:03.939
but she was not here in
New York City on MI6 business.

41:03.983 --> 41:06.072
You said she
sent a text?

41:06.115 --> 41:08.161
What did she say?
Just "MB."

41:08.204 --> 41:09.423
I thought it meant
"Maya Bhaduri here."

41:09.467 --> 41:11.294
"MB..."

41:11.338 --> 41:13.514
Maybe she did leave
something. MB...

41:13.558 --> 41:16.474
Mini bar?

41:29.487 --> 41:30.923
We'll make this right.

41:49.115 --> 41:50.333
Wait.

41:55.817 --> 41:56.818
Oh, my God.

41:56.862 --> 41:59.386
It is Pasternak.

41:59.429 --> 42:01.344
It can't be.
We know he's dead.

42:01.388 --> 42:03.346
You shot
that traitor.

42:03.390 --> 42:05.610
Looks like we were wrong.
