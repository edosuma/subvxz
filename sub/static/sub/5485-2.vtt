00:04.471 --> 00:06.771
          (screaming)

00:06.773 --> 00:07.938
                         BERBER:
           There are many things

00:07.939 --> 00:10.173
we do not know about our leader.

00:10.175 --> 00:11.440
        Even Petra knows
       little of his life

00:11.442 --> 00:13.275
  <i> before he came to the river.</i>

00:13.277 --> 00:15.143
Will you ever
tell me what you see?

00:15.145 --> 00:17.011
ANGEL CHILD AND ANNORA:
Your savior needs you

00:17.013 --> 00:19.113
        to live the life
      of a different man.

00:19.115 --> 00:21.115
                            MAN:
                  Gawain Maddox!

00:21.117 --> 00:22.883
         The traveling punisher.
Ah.

00:22.885 --> 00:24.985
     This is half my wage.

00:24.987 --> 00:26.886
If you do not find this
satisfactory,

00:26.888 --> 00:28.454
                        move on.

00:28.456 --> 00:30.322
                  Time is a most
          aggressive foe, Milus.

00:30.324 --> 00:31.823
    I need to make my gains now.

00:31.825 --> 00:33.324
       <i> We need to fortify</i>
         <i> our resources.</i>

00:33.326 --> 00:35.959
   <i> Steeper taxes and tariffs.</i>

00:35.961 --> 00:37.393
LADY LOVE:
You will break them, Milus.

00:37.395 --> 00:38.894
        And we both know
 there's nothing more dangerous

00:38.896 --> 00:41.062
        than a Welshman
    who has nothing to lose.

00:41.064 --> 00:42.663
       Tell me, Baroness.

00:42.665 --> 00:44.798
     <i> How is it that someone</i>
       <i> of your privilege</i>

00:44.800 --> 00:47.634
        <i> may come to know</i>
 <i> the plight of the common man?</i>

00:47.636 --> 00:49.836
                   It is time.

00:49.838 --> 00:51.304
TORAN:
Brother Wilk.

00:51.306 --> 00:52.471
      Ventris comes again.
                        Already?

00:52.473 --> 00:53.572
JACOB: <i> They'll take what little</i>

00:53.574 --> 00:55.740
stock and harvest we have left.

00:55.742 --> 00:57.241
 We can't do this without you.

00:57.243 --> 00:59.076
              Yea.

00:59.078 --> 01:00.744
     Gather supplies. We'll need
          to ride before midday.

01:00.746 --> 01:03.747
             PETRA:
  <i> You're not a rebel, Wilkin.</i>

01:03.749 --> 01:05.682
  JONAS: <i> Took us in darkness. </i>
           (laughter)

01:05.684 --> 01:06.649
         Deadly ghosts.

01:06.651 --> 01:07.883
       <i> In familiar hoods.</i>

01:07.885 --> 01:08.884
  <i> There was another this time.</i>

01:08.886 --> 01:10.552
    <i> Saw a flash of his face.</i>

01:10.554 --> 01:13.021
             PETRA:
   <i> Ventris is sly and brutal.</i>

01:13.023 --> 01:15.423
       It's only time and chance
      before you feel his blade.

01:15.425 --> 01:16.557
       We've barely stock
       and food to live.

01:16.559 --> 01:18.358
           You're the only stock

01:18.360 --> 01:20.760
           I can't live without!

01:20.762 --> 01:23.763
  Is there a mind for fairness
     in your swift purpose?

01:23.765 --> 01:25.097
      Of course, my love.

01:25.099 --> 01:27.265
  Fair process for every man.

01:27.267 --> 01:28.532
We can't do this alone anymore.

   <i> You saw the daffodil hides</i>
         <i> in the trees.</i>

01:30.402 --> 01:31.901
     The Byth Encil rebels

01:34.605 --> 01:36.271

01:36.273 --> 01:37.505
 They went to Glen Darby Birch.

01:37.507 --> 01:38.706
       With their hoods?

01:38.708 --> 01:40.040
                Yea! With hoods!

11:11.948 --> 11:14.315
So you found your bandits.

11:14.317 --> 11:16.283
                             No.

11:16.285 --> 11:19.318
             But we met with the
           proof of their guilt.

11:21.255 --> 11:23.255
      And you've returned
        with that proof?

11:23.257 --> 11:25.790

11:29.962 --> 11:32.095
                        CORBETT:
                        My lord.

11:32.097 --> 11:34.263
       A scout came through from
          midshire this morning.

11:34.265 --> 11:36.965
       Spotted seven men
   traveling east last night.

11:36.967 --> 11:39.801
        One with a sword
   bearing Longshanks' mark.

11:39.803 --> 11:41.803
                Our bandits on a
               mission, perhaps.

11:41.805 --> 11:44.272
     Taking their vengeance
          to my gate?

11:44.274 --> 11:46.641
 Are they that mad with grief?

11:46.643 --> 11:50.144
Or soldiers willing to die
in service of their sorrow.

11:50.146 --> 11:52.312
I think it best
we meet them in journey,

11:52.314 --> 11:55.648
  away from anyone who may see
   this fool play as valiant.

11:55.650 --> 11:57.116
                           Stay.

11:57.118 --> 11:59.284
              Protect the walls.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.052
     Prepare a full legion
       of foot soldiers.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.354
 I'll gut this warrior bandit.

12:03.356 --> 12:06.023
  Choke him cold with a snare
      of his own entrails.

12:06.025 --> 12:08.091
A fine plan, my lord.

12:11.729 --> 12:14.196
Are you waiting
for a royal proclamation?

12:14.198 --> 12:15.830
Go with him, Reeve.

12:15.832 --> 12:18.065
                    Yes, indeed.
                    Chamberlain.

12:18.067 --> 12:19.566
                        My lady.

12:43.856 --> 12:46.189
     Who are you, traveler?

12:46.191 --> 12:48.191
     Gawain Maddox, milord.

12:48.193 --> 12:49.926
   I come up from the South.

12:49.928 --> 12:51.761
       Punisher by trade.

12:51.763 --> 12:53.763
 You have tools in possession?

12:53.765 --> 12:55.364
                         Yea'on.

12:55.366 --> 12:56.732
         Ride with us.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.367
I may need
your services.

12:59.369 --> 13:01.702
           My family.

13:01.704 --> 13:03.203
Ride the main trail north.

13:03.205 --> 13:05.171
It leads to Castle Ventris.

13:05.173 --> 13:07.239
They can wait there.

13:09.176 --> 13:11.176
Just follow on.

13:11.178 --> 13:13.244
I'll be with you.

13:19.584 --> 13:21.650
      (horses sputtering)

13:34.898 --> 13:38.799
      Do you remember me,
        Earl Constable?

13:40.736 --> 13:42.802
         I'm the knight
     you sent to his death

13:42.804 --> 13:46.104
          at the hands
     of the hoarding Scots.

13:47.073 --> 13:49.039
          Impossible.

13:49.041 --> 13:52.575
  You know this man, my lord?

13:52.577 --> 13:55.978
               If you are indeed
                    that knight,

13:55.980 --> 13:59.581
                 you're either a
            deserter or a ghost.

13:59.583 --> 14:03.050
               If not dead then,

14:03.052 --> 14:05.118
         then dead now.

14:10.792 --> 14:14.793
     I live with the terror
  of your betrayal every day.

14:17.497 --> 14:21.432
 But I'll spare you that pain.

14:21.434 --> 14:24.401
  Death will quiet your mind.

14:33.444 --> 14:35.543
They're all rebels, milord.

14:37.847 --> 14:41.248
    Time to go back to hell,
         Marcher Baron!

14:42.117 --> 14:43.449
           (whistles)

14:43.451 --> 14:44.716

19:02.416 --> 19:06.250
Only blood runs,

He will sleep.

 No rock unturned until our shit
  holes are split on the cradle.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.108
            in our pope's grace?

19:37.110 --> 19:40.077
       A moor, converted

19:42.181 --> 19:44.414
  A good Catholic like us all.

19:45.550 --> 19:48.617
                Yea. Bloody work
                  is the Lord's.

19:48.619 --> 19:49.950
                          TORAN:
                         Indeed.

19:52.521 --> 19:54.654
         I need a name
      to offer my thanks.

19:54.656 --> 19:56.322
           Gruffudd.

19:56.324 --> 19:59.158
         You're the one
     they call "the wolf."

19:59.160 --> 20:01.160
                 I'm called many
                    hard things.

20:01.162 --> 20:02.561
                Most by my wife.

20:02.563 --> 20:05.196
    Thank you for answering
      our plea, Gruffudd.

20:05.198 --> 20:06.830
                   We serve each
                  other, friend.

20:06.832 --> 20:09.332
   The baron's forged weapons
    will be a welcome change

20:09.334 --> 20:11.367
        from our sticks
      and cobbled blades.

20:11.369 --> 20:13.235
        Ventris has lost
      nearly two legions.

20:13.237 --> 20:14.569
     His army is weakened.

20:14.571 --> 20:16.337
We're not ready to storm walls.

20:16.339 --> 20:17.905
    Even with noble swords.

20:17.907 --> 20:21.841
    But word of this victory
will spread and it will inspire.

20:21.843 --> 20:23.175
                     Our numbers
                      will grow.

20:23.177 --> 20:24.910
        I have no doubt.

20:24.912 --> 20:28.179
      Godspeed for your knight's
           return to sound body.

20:28.181 --> 20:30.514
                An unlikely ally
                   in our fight.

20:30.516 --> 20:32.516
              Let him know there
                 may come a time

20:32.518 --> 20:34.317
                  when I collect
                  on this favor.

20:43.394 --> 20:45.560
          Toran, Moor!

20:51.500 --> 20:53.099
                You crazy witch!

20:59.740 --> 21:01.239
          To what end

21:01.241 --> 21:03.307
does this devilry serve?

21:06.678 --> 21:08.744
           (grunting)

21:17.420 --> 21:19.386
         The baron has returned?

21:19.388 --> 21:22.389
No. But I have
news of his need.

21:22.391 --> 21:24.624
        At Heaven's Eye,
   we saw the rebel symbols.

21:24.626 --> 21:28.026
   Lord Ventris sent me back
     to secure more troops.

21:29.796 --> 21:32.296
     Sent you back? Alone?

21:32.298 --> 21:34.064
 Not to spare arms he may need.

21:34.066 --> 21:36.132
      I welcomed the risk
        of riding apart.

21:47.811 --> 21:50.411
 Gather what men we can spare.

21:50.413 --> 21:52.146
          With haste.

21:55.750 --> 21:57.649
Shall I find
the baroness?

21:57.651 --> 22:00.618
  No. You should find a bath.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.387
       You reek of shit.

22:03.389 --> 22:04.855
           And fear.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.706
            (sighs)

22:48.699 --> 22:50.765
            (groans)

22:56.271 --> 22:59.105
      You join the living.

22:59.107 --> 23:00.773
Who did this?

23:00.775 --> 23:03.041
                     The healer.

23:03.043 --> 23:05.109
     She offered no reason.

23:12.518 --> 23:14.017
            (groans)

23:35.206 --> 23:37.272
         Cut her binds.

23:50.687 --> 23:53.187
  Why did you cut and scar me?

23:53.189 --> 23:56.023
          To save you.

23:56.025 --> 23:58.425
                Your only chance

23:58.427 --> 24:01.294
to live is to be supposed dead.

24:03.564 --> 24:05.630
He gives you that gift.

24:24.016 --> 24:26.516
             Who are you, woman?

24:26.518 --> 24:28.351
                          Truly.

24:28.353 --> 24:31.420
                     What's your
                 interest in me?

24:34.057 --> 24:37.591
       You have a fate...

24:37.593 --> 24:39.693
  that you must learn to hold.

24:39.695 --> 24:44.631
One that will forever
mark your place in time.

24:46.601 --> 24:49.334
       I am here to help
        tell that story.

24:51.304 --> 24:53.370
       My story is over.

24:53.372 --> 24:55.238
No.

24:55.240 --> 24:58.708
It is just begun.

24:58.710 --> 25:01.944
   The angel spoke the truth.

25:05.882 --> 25:08.115
           The angel?

25:08.117 --> 25:11.350
        The bright child
        who came to you.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.853
             How...

25:16.790 --> 25:20.891
      I've never whispered
   a word of that to anyone.

25:22.895 --> 25:25.695
    I hear the same voices.

25:29.133 --> 25:33.067
     It's time to lay down
  this sword, Wilkin Brattle.

25:34.603 --> 25:36.769
(angel child's voice):
Your savior needs you

25:36.771 --> 25:40.038
        to live the life
      of a different man.

26:12.004 --> 26:14.004
              Unhitch one of the
                horses, brother.

26:14.006 --> 26:16.506
                Then go join the
            others at the caves.

26:16.508 --> 26:20.176
      I think I'll finish
       the ride, friend.

26:20.178 --> 26:22.911
  A plan hatched by a witch--
        what's to worry?

26:24.848 --> 26:29.516
       We deliver the dead, tell
         the tale, and ride off.

26:29.518 --> 26:32.185
              Free men, no price
                    on our head.

26:32.187 --> 26:34.020
            It's a sound devise.

26:34.022 --> 26:36.622
  Simple enough an executioner
     could carry it forth.

26:36.624 --> 26:38.624
                      (chuckles)

26:38.626 --> 26:40.792
                    And what say
                of your purpose.

26:40.794 --> 26:44.428
              What name for you?
                    Sneermonger?

26:46.465 --> 26:50.366
Well, my da, he wanted
to call me Marshal.

26:50.368 --> 26:53.068
But my ma thought it
too destined to war.

26:53.070 --> 26:56.004
                Ma got the name,
             da got the destiny.

26:56.006 --> 26:58.006
Yea, indeed.

26:58.008 --> 27:00.008
And what of your father?

27:00.010 --> 27:02.109
You never tell of anything.

27:04.746 --> 27:08.113
        There's nothing to tell.
               I don't have one.

27:10.884 --> 27:12.316
            (grunts)

27:14.720 --> 27:17.487
       (children's choir
      singing Latin hymn)

27:29.867 --> 27:32.300
        (choir continues
      singing Latin hymn)

27:51.520 --> 27:53.186
       (choir continues)

27:53.188 --> 27:54.687
ISABEL:
Pardon, Baroness.

27:54.689 --> 27:56.088
     (choir stops singing)

27:56.090 --> 27:57.722
      Outsiders have come.

27:57.724 --> 27:59.256
      They bring sad news.

28:14.405 --> 28:16.471
        Bring him down.

28:53.142 --> 28:56.309
    My deepest condolences,
           Lady Love.

28:56.311 --> 28:58.644
 Let's bring you and the baron
        into the castle

28:58.646 --> 29:00.712
   so you can mourn in peace.

29:11.290 --> 29:14.691
Have the baron taken
to the sacrament room.

29:25.003 --> 29:27.402
          Who are you?

29:30.340 --> 29:32.340
          Gawain Maddox, milady.

29:32.342 --> 29:36.343
              Punisher by trade,
         from the southern land.

29:36.345 --> 29:38.345
                This is Marshal,

29:38.347 --> 29:43.149
  a journey soldier-- he aids me
  in the capture of the accused.

29:43.151 --> 29:45.618
Tell me of his death.

29:45.620 --> 29:48.787
                We met the baron
                at Heaven's Eye.

29:48.789 --> 29:50.789
                  Called upon us
               to ride with him.

29:50.791 --> 29:52.323
            At the grass fields,

29:52.325 --> 29:54.625
             they crossed a band
              of hooded thieves.

29:54.627 --> 29:55.993
              Took a fierce run.

29:55.995 --> 29:58.662
       Noblemen cut down
       the seven of them.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.830
WILKIN:
Before the baron could rally,

30:00.832 --> 30:02.799
                rebels attacked.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.134
                     50 or more.

30:05.136 --> 30:08.770
Caught the ranks tired
and out of formation.

30:08.772 --> 30:12.840
Your husband fought gallantly,
but the numbers were too steep.

30:14.143 --> 30:15.842
                      I'm sorry.

30:19.947 --> 30:21.780
       Old men and boys.

30:21.782 --> 30:24.181
WILKIN: Your mail-clad soldiers
were too heavy to carry.

30:26.185 --> 30:28.919
We can send troops there
to collect the others.

30:28.921 --> 30:31.922
LADY LOVE: And what brings
an executioner to Ventrishire?

30:31.924 --> 30:33.790
         Work, milady.

30:33.792 --> 30:35.858
       I travel, go where
    my services are needed.

30:35.860 --> 30:37.925
                        RANDULF:
                        He lies!

30:39.929 --> 30:41.762
This man is
not the executioner.

30:43.766 --> 30:45.632
He's one of the thieves.

30:45.634 --> 30:47.200
        As is that one.

30:47.202 --> 30:50.102
           You're the liar, sir.

30:50.104 --> 30:53.371
I've traveled with Gawain
for many years.

30:53.373 --> 30:55.940
Dispatch a messenger
to Glamorgan for proof.

30:55.942 --> 30:58.809
          There is no other face
            looks like this one.

30:58.811 --> 31:01.111
                         WILKIN:
                    We just came

31:01.113 --> 31:03.046
to deliver the dead.

31:03.048 --> 31:05.048
Out of respect.

31:05.050 --> 31:07.016
We'll leave if it upsets
your court.

31:07.018 --> 31:10.519
 You'll stay and be quartered.

31:10.521 --> 31:13.888
  The remedy for this dispute
        is already here.

31:15.324 --> 31:17.490
     The wife and children
      of Maddox, sent here

31:17.492 --> 31:19.725
to wait for his return.

31:23.229 --> 31:25.628
         Come forward.

31:28.499 --> 31:30.899
              Tell us the truth.

31:30.901 --> 31:33.401
Is this man indeed your husband?

31:52.988 --> 31:55.054
           (fussing)

32:00.827 --> 32:02.726
             (trembling breaths)

32:02.728 --> 32:04.794
                     (whispers):
                      I'm sorry.

32:11.402 --> 32:13.468
My love.

32:16.005 --> 32:19.239
Good Maddy, thank God
you've come back safe.

32:23.911 --> 32:25.744
        This is lunacy!

32:25.746 --> 32:28.313
She conspires with him!

32:32.451 --> 32:35.385
        Such tragedy...

32:35.387 --> 32:37.854
   lands on my name this day.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.227
       My dearest friend,

32:45.229 --> 32:48.630
a life snuffed...

32:48.632 --> 32:51.199
not in a fitting battle...

32:52.402 --> 32:55.636
      ...but by the ambush
        of painted dogs.

32:58.073 --> 33:01.574
          And my kin.

33:01.576 --> 33:04.443
   Caught between two tales.

33:04.445 --> 33:06.311
      I speak only truth,
         dear brother.

33:06.313 --> 33:08.980
     I have nothing to gain
        from such a lie.

33:08.982 --> 33:11.215
         These men are
    the bandits we pursued.

33:11.217 --> 33:13.217
               Did battle in the
          fields beyond the eye.

33:13.219 --> 33:16.220
            I myself
   and other honored knights

33:16.222 --> 33:18.255
         heard you tell
    how you were dispatched

33:18.257 --> 33:20.857
     <i> before</i> any such fray.

33:24.595 --> 33:26.094
              Yea.

33:26.096 --> 33:28.429
         I did, but...
WILKIN: You may have

33:28.431 --> 33:32.399
            nothing to gain, but
            you've much to hide.

33:32.401 --> 33:36.069
  We saw this man at the fray.

33:36.071 --> 33:39.072
  He tucked tail and slithered
   away, letting his brothers

33:39.074 --> 33:42.275
fall to the curs.

33:42.277 --> 33:44.477
             That's why he lies.

33:44.479 --> 33:45.978
'Cause we know
the truth.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.446
           That's...

33:47.448 --> 33:49.514
  I tell you, these are the...
CORBETT: Enough!

34:00.993 --> 34:03.660
       So, then, Reeve...

34:03.662 --> 34:06.996
 you are either a false accuser

34:06.998 --> 34:09.398
 or you deserted your commander
           in battle!

34:11.335 --> 34:14.268
         Both come with
     a punishment of death!

34:16.338 --> 34:18.838
         (whispering):
           Please...

34:18.840 --> 34:20.773
            Milus...

34:20.775 --> 34:22.341
           brother...

34:22.342 --> 34:23.842
                 do not do this.

34:23.844 --> 34:25.443
           Take him!

34:25.445 --> 34:27.110
          Brother, we are blood.

34:27.112 --> 34:28.846
               Do not betray me.
                       Damn you!

34:28.848 --> 34:30.347
     Damn your half-hatred!

34:30.349 --> 34:31.514
                       Damn y...

34:31.516 --> 34:32.348
            (grunts)

34:32.350 --> 34:34.315
(gasping)

34:34.318 --> 34:36.051
                 (Randulf yells)

34:36.053 --> 34:38.820
        (Randulf shouts)

34:38.822 --> 34:40.154
Curse you!

34:40.156 --> 34:41.688
I'll curse you
from hell!

34:41.690 --> 34:43.589
               (Randulf sobbing)

34:51.665 --> 34:55.098
                My shame is only
          outdone by my sadness.

34:57.068 --> 35:00.369
My deepest sympathies, Baroness.

35:00.371 --> 35:03.939
     I am in your service,
       whatever the need.

35:05.509 --> 35:07.641
       Thank you, Milus.

35:09.678 --> 35:12.611
        I will do haste
   with manor law and trial.

35:14.681 --> 35:16.347
        It is fitting...

35:16.349 --> 35:18.482
that the man falsely accused

35:18.484 --> 35:22.085
be the one who is skilled
to take his head.

35:33.497 --> 35:36.931
      Welcome to Castle Ventris,
                    executioner.

36:12.100 --> 36:14.300
                       Baroness.

36:14.302 --> 36:17.136
     The priest, he said I could
        come for evening prayer.

36:17.138 --> 36:18.770
          Please, sit.

36:18.772 --> 36:20.805
  I welcome the chapel's use.

36:20.807 --> 36:23.774
  Few spend time here but me.

36:27.446 --> 36:29.512
          Do you mind?

36:31.315 --> 36:33.014
            Please.

36:41.957 --> 36:43.990
        I wouldn't think

36:43.992 --> 36:47.559
    one of your trade would
 complicate things with prayer.

36:49.996 --> 36:53.364
Perhaps it takes you
in deeper.

36:58.269 --> 37:01.236
                   May I ask how
                  this happened?

37:03.340 --> 37:05.673
It was given to me
by a healer.

37:05.675 --> 37:08.842
A holy woman.

37:08.844 --> 37:11.343
A reminder
of my need for faith.

37:13.780 --> 37:15.846
               Your soldier gave
                  the impression

37:15.848 --> 37:17.848
                it distinguished
              you for some time.

37:17.850 --> 37:21.318
      Yet, the burn looks fresh.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.154
I renew the vow
when my faith wavers.

37:28.092 --> 37:30.492
                You're bleeding.

37:30.494 --> 37:32.927
    Yea.

37:32.929 --> 37:36.330
An angry branch
on last night's ride.

37:36.332 --> 37:38.832
                          May I?

37:38.834 --> 37:41.167
                         WILKIN:
                In here, milady?

37:41.169 --> 37:42.835
                      LADY LOVE:
                   No better one

37:42.837 --> 37:45.237
           to heal you than Him.

37:56.015 --> 37:58.515
                   The physicker
            should look at this.

38:01.386 --> 38:05.921
         (baby crying)

38:18.068 --> 38:20.535
I'll find the physicker.

38:20.537 --> 38:23.905
                 No. Stay.

38:23.907 --> 38:25.706
           Finish your devotion.

38:25.708 --> 38:28.909
         I'll have him find you.

38:55.069 --> 38:58.837
            Baroness?

38:58.839 --> 39:02.040
I sent an emissary
to London

39:02.042 --> 39:07.010
and one to Erik's brother
in Coventry.

39:07.012 --> 39:12.048
I'm sure our king will offer
comfort and guidance

39:12.050 --> 39:14.617
of how we proceed
to govern.

39:14.619 --> 39:17.954
                   We proceed by
             burying my husband.

39:19.123 --> 39:21.456
              Yes.

39:21.458 --> 39:23.691
           Of course.

39:25.795 --> 39:28.195
        Another thought,

39:28.197 --> 39:30.197
my lady.

39:30.199 --> 39:33.533
This executioner--

39:33.535 --> 39:35.535
his arrival,

39:35.537 --> 39:39.038
although it brought sadness--

39:39.040 --> 39:41.373
it could turn
to good fortune.

39:41.375 --> 39:42.807
                    How so?

39:42.809 --> 39:45.376
If we secure him
and his soldier,

39:45.378 --> 39:48.379
we gain skilled men
to hunt offenders

39:48.381 --> 39:50.714
and carry out the correction.

39:50.716 --> 39:55.218
Sends a sound message.

39:55.220 --> 39:58.654
      Ventrishire will not
      suffer lawlessness.

40:01.492 --> 40:04.993
      That's well advised,
       dear Chamberlain.

40:04.995 --> 40:07.895
  Good. I'll draft the letters

40:07.897 --> 40:10.330
that bind them.

40:29.383 --> 40:33.451
I have news, Maddox.

40:34.954 --> 40:39.122
The trial was swift,
the guilt clear.

40:40.592 --> 40:43.059
We will stage the execution
in the village square

40:43.061 --> 40:45.494
midday tomorrow.

40:51.568 --> 40:54.268
        He's your blood.

40:54.270 --> 40:56.703
     There must be some...

40:56.705 --> 41:00.073
due leniency, a brother's mercy?

41:00.075 --> 41:02.542
    You rid me of a mistake

41:02.544 --> 41:07.012
 influenced by familial guilt.

41:08.615 --> 41:12.483
      No kin, no worries.

41:14.253 --> 41:17.053
         But of course,
 you wouldn't understand that.

41:17.055 --> 41:20.723
      Being a family man.

41:20.725 --> 41:23.825
   And you're the final word
        of justice here?

41:26.262 --> 41:29.596
     As well as chancellor
          and advisor.

41:29.598 --> 41:33.266
You'll find that nothing passes

41:33.268 --> 41:36.736
       through this shire
    without me touching it.

41:36.738 --> 41:39.171
   I'm afraid that's a lesson
       I'll have to miss.

41:39.173 --> 41:41.173
   I move on after tomorrow.

41:41.175 --> 41:43.341
Ah, but that's my news.

41:43.343 --> 41:47.577
      You and your soldier
         will stay on.

41:47.579 --> 41:50.146
 Your position is now standing.

41:54.685 --> 41:57.085
       We're journeyman.

41:57.087 --> 41:58.953
                      Travelers.

41:58.955 --> 42:00.754
     Now, you have a home.

42:00.756 --> 42:04.857
I'm sure that will be
a comfort to your

42:04.859 --> 42:07.993
      wife and wee things.

42:11.698 --> 42:14.231
       (breathing loudly)

42:21.707 --> 42:24.206
    Why are you doing this?

42:26.810 --> 42:29.677
Our buried truths bind us.

42:29.679 --> 42:32.713
And your skills
will serve me.

42:38.853 --> 42:41.320
I need a man

42:41.322 --> 42:43.722
with the heart
of a dragon.

43:08.148 --> 43:10.614
          (scratching)

43:12.718 --> 43:15.284
          (soft gasp)

43:17.488 --> 43:19.955
ANNORA:
Ludwig?

43:31.567 --> 43:33.967
      (shallow breathing)

43:47.381 --> 43:51.116
We need to ready our faith.

43:51.118 --> 43:56.020
                     (shakily):
               <i> Ja, meine Liebe.</i>

44:02.093 --> 44:04.493
             (breathing shakily)

44:22.545 --> 44:25.412
 FATHER: <i> Dominus noster Jesus
Christus te absolvat. </i> (groans)

44:25.414 --> 44:27.947
        <i> Ego auctoritate</i>

44:27.949 --> 44:31.116
       <i> ipsius te absolvo</i>

44:31.118 --> 44:35.453
 <i> ab omni vinculo</i>
<i> excommunicationis</i> <i> et interdicti</i>

44:35.455 --> 44:38.556
 (boys singing chant in Latin)
              <i> in quantum possum</i>

44:38.558 --> 44:41.458
                <i> et tu indiges. </i>
           (groaning)

44:41.460 --> 44:44.727
                 <i> Ego te absolvo</i>

44:44.729 --> 44:47.763
        <i> a peccatis tuis</i>

44:47.765 --> 44:50.565
              <i> in nomine Patris,</i>
                      <i> et Filii,</i>

44:50.567 --> 44:52.366
   <i> et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.</i>

44:56.905 --> 45:00.006
              (Randulf groaning)

45:06.446 --> 45:08.879
   (singing chant continues)

45:14.619 --> 45:17.019
 Blades have been grinded, sir.

45:26.296 --> 45:28.696
        (groans softly)

45:46.681 --> 45:49.181
        (groans softly)

45:55.621 --> 45:58.054
   (singing chant continues)

46:02.727 --> 46:05.561
     (whispering, laughing)

46:05.563 --> 46:08.030
        (inhales deeply)

46:08.032 --> 46:10.032
        (exhales deeply)

46:10.034 --> 46:12.467
           (quietly):
            Help me.

46:15.705 --> 46:18.272
       (crowd murmuring)

46:59.381 --> 47:03.149
            Always.

47:17.565 --> 47:19.064
  You'll need this, headsman.

47:19.066 --> 47:21.900
Little Rand
was full of shit.

47:21.902 --> 47:23.768
