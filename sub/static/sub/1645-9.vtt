the most powerful man in Panama.

13:37.512 --> 13:40.471
A ruthless killer
with an army of thugs

13:40.515 --> 13:42.517
and thieves behind him.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.258
He killed judges,
policemen,

13:44.301 --> 13:45.868
anyone who stood in his way.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.392
They said he couldn't
be stopped, but now

13:48.436 --> 13:51.395
Lechero is in prison,
and I'm in power.

13:51.439 --> 13:55.704
I decide whose life is at stake,
and right now, it's yours.

13:57.314 --> 14:01.710
From the moment
I got here...

14:03.016 --> 14:05.540
I've been planning my escape.

14:12.286 --> 14:13.635
He's talking.

14:13.678 --> 14:15.419
How do you know?

14:15.463 --> 14:17.769
You can't get out of the box
any other way.

14:31.261 --> 14:34.482
[AC whirring]

14:34.525 --> 14:36.963
The people who sent
the helicopters,

14:37.006 --> 14:40.140
they're the
same people

14:40.183 --> 14:41.793
who framed my brother

14:41.837 --> 14:43.143
back in the U.S.,

14:43.186 --> 14:44.274
the same people

14:44.318 --> 14:47.712
who wanted me here in Sona.

14:47.756 --> 14:51.281
In order for you to break out
another inmate?

14:51.325 --> 14:53.153
Yes.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.329
Who are these people?

14:55.372 --> 14:58.288
I don't know,

14:58.332 --> 15:01.161
but they have my brother's son.

15:01.204 --> 15:04.164
They like to keep collateral.

15:04.207 --> 15:08.211
I could be putting his life
in danger as we speak.

15:08.255 --> 15:10.735
If what you told me is true...

15:12.476 --> 15:14.652
...you would be saving him.

15:14.696 --> 15:17.046
I would call my troops
and order a search

15:17.090 --> 15:18.874
for the boy immediately.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.877
But this story...

15:21.921 --> 15:23.183
it's fiction.

15:23.226 --> 15:24.314
It's true.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.882
It's what you wanted.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.102
It's the only thing
I have left to give.

15:30.799 --> 15:33.106
Please.

15:33.149 --> 15:35.760
His name is LJ.

What's that smell?

15:48.860 --> 15:49.557
They're Armandos.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.342
These things cost money.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.388
Yeah, somebody gave them to me--
I don't even smoke those things.

15:54.431 --> 15:55.911
Who?This guy I

15:55.955 --> 15:57.826
ran some stuff
into the prison for, man.

15:57.869 --> 15:59.915
You ran some stuff into
the prison? Like what? Drugs?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.699
I don't know.
Who cares? He paid me.

16:01.743 --> 16:04.267
You should have quit that job,
man, I...I know, I know, okay?

16:04.311 --> 16:05.573
I need some cash
for my kid.

16:05.616 --> 16:07.357
Maricruz doesn't have
insurance, all right?

16:07.401 --> 16:09.969
Listen. I... I just saw Michael.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.884
He's in solitary
confinement.
What?

16:12.928 --> 16:15.191
They put him in a box
out in the middle
of the yard,

16:15.235 --> 16:16.323
all by himself.

16:16.366 --> 16:17.977
He can't
do anything.

16:19.021 --> 16:21.023
It's going
to be okay.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.546
It's not going to be okay.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.331
I don't know what to do, man.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.769
Everything's just falling apart.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.472
What you lookin' at?

16:35.516 --> 16:36.386
The view.

16:36.430 --> 16:37.866
I can't help
but notice

16:37.909 --> 16:39.563
you and Lechero
made friends.

16:39.607 --> 16:41.174
He's been
hanging out

16:41.217 --> 16:42.566
with a lot
of white boys lately.

16:42.610 --> 16:45.178
Got a problem
with that?No. But Sammy does.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.615
See, I've been
looking close,
like I always do.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.791
And I know you all would
be a lot better off

16:49.834 --> 16:51.662
if Sammy were no longer around.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.621
Wouldn't have
to worry

16:53.664 --> 16:56.058
about his snout poking
in your business.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.842
And you're suggesting...?

16:57.886 --> 17:00.062
You and I both know
it needs to happen.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.499
There aren't many men in Sona
that would take on Sammy.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.327
I have one particular man
in mind.

17:04.371 --> 17:05.894
A man who owes me.

17:05.937 --> 17:09.289
But if I pull through,
I'm in the club, guaranteed.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.378
You're gonna see to it.[chuckles]

17:11.421 --> 17:12.727
All right.

17:12.770 --> 17:15.295
I assume you have the power
to make this deal.

17:15.338 --> 17:17.253
I do.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.342
Agreed.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.434
Right.

17:24.478 --> 17:25.392
Well...

17:25.435 --> 17:27.742
Thank you, sir.

what you told me and, uh...

17:59.121 --> 18:00.557
but I can't quit my job.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.124
Do whatever you want
to do.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.778
Well, I would if you could kick
me a few bucks, you know.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.345
Are we gonna do this
again? I told you.

18:05.388 --> 18:06.563
I don't have any cash.

18:06.607 --> 18:07.434
What do you expect me to do?

18:07.477 --> 18:08.652
Do whatever you want.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.219
You could use my help, right?

18:10.263 --> 18:11.655
You're gonna start charging
me now for your friendship?

18:11.699 --> 18:12.830
I got a kid on the way!

18:12.874 --> 18:15.920
And I got a kid I may
never see again.

Yeah, get me Gretchen.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.634
Much to my surprise,

18:33.677 --> 18:36.463
there seems to be some degree
of truth to your tale.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.465
Everything
I told you is true.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.554
That's for me to determine.What more can I say?

18:41.772 --> 18:44.558
the one you've been
sent to free--

18:44.601 --> 18:46.908
he should be able to verify
what you've told me.

18:46.951 --> 18:50.390
He should, but...
I don't know if he will.

18:50.433 --> 18:53.132
Tell me his name.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.308
These people won't hesitate
to kill my nephew.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.919
I need to know you're gonna do
everything you can to find him.

18:57.962 --> 18:59.747
I will, but I need a name.I need your word.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.531
You have it. I'll find the boy.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.838
Now, the name.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.583
Hey.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.630
What's wrong?

19:13.674 --> 19:15.806
Why don't you
tell me?

19:15.850 --> 19:17.417
I went to that
apartment,

19:17.460 --> 19:19.027
your apartment.

19:19.070 --> 19:21.595
And this woman showed up
like she knew you.

19:21.638 --> 19:24.424
And then I found
a passport.

Who's Gary Miller?

of this place.

for us to be together.

about France?

anymore?

serious charges.

Michael Scofield told me

20:22.917 --> 20:24.266
there are some people out there

20:24.310 --> 20:27.400
who are very determined
to get you out of here.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.664
What's he talking about?

20:30.707 --> 20:32.187
You know nothing
about this?

20:32.231 --> 20:33.536
No.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.799
Scofield's a smart man, but, uh,

20:35.843 --> 20:38.759
he's got a rabid imagination.

20:38.802 --> 20:41.240
So you're calling him a liar?

20:42.197 --> 20:44.417
More or less.

20:46.636 --> 20:49.378
I've been able to verify
the story.

20:49.422 --> 20:52.686
I already know everything,

20:52.729 --> 20:54.644
Mr. Whistler,
in detail.

20:54.688 --> 20:55.863
I just need a name.

20:55.906 --> 20:58.300
Who's in charge on the outside?

20:58.344 --> 21:01.608
We can end this right now
if you can provide it.

start over.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.652

There you are.

21:45.695 --> 21:47.436
And here I am,

of goodies.

I was afraid you was
gone for good.

same without you.

got it comin'.

Now, you get well,
and you get him out
there in that ring,

22:13.201 --> 22:15.725
and you do that one,
that... neck thing.

22:15.769 --> 22:16.944
In exchange,

I'm gonna cover
all your medical expenses.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.777
I'll tell you what.
You take your time, huh?

22:23.820 --> 22:25.518
I'm gonna go get my
bag right now,

let me down.

Maybe now you'll feel
more comfortable

22:36.964 --> 22:38.487
telling me the truth.

22:41.142 --> 22:43.187
Are you working
with Scofield?

22:47.017 --> 22:48.802
Are you working
with Scofield?!

22:48.845 --> 22:51.587
Yes! Yes, I'm working
with Scofield.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.503
But there's no one else
involved.

23:02.424 --> 23:05.732
As they say in America,
we're gonna get this story

23:05.775 --> 23:07.386
straight.

23:07.429 --> 23:08.865
I told him the truth.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.737
I suggest you do the same.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.869
I have.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.436
He's confirmed nothing!

23:14.480 --> 23:15.959
Ask him about that woman
he's been meeting with.

23:16.003 --> 23:17.396
Huh?

23:19.441 --> 23:20.921
That's not what you think.

23:20.964 --> 23:22.401
Doesn't matter what I think;
it matters what you know,

23:22.444 --> 23:23.489
and you know
her name.

23:23.532 --> 23:24.446
And the fact
that he won't admit it

23:24.490 --> 23:26.143
tells me
that he's no

23:26.187 --> 23:28.450
innocent bystander in this.You know I am.

23:28.494 --> 23:31.061

way we're getting out of here.

and he can't do anything

where she lives,

you find her.

Alone.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.042
This right here

24:39.086 --> 24:41.349
is as alone as we're gonna get.

I heard about your argument
with Lincoln.

24:45.658 --> 24:47.486
You people are everywhere, huh?

24:47.529 --> 24:48.704
Now, you know him better

24:48.748 --> 24:51.272
than I do, but from
personal experience,

24:51.315 --> 24:53.361
Burrows can be
hard to handle.

24:53.404 --> 24:55.624
That man does not like
to be told what to do.

24:55.668 --> 24:58.888
He sure likes bossing
everyone else around.

24:58.932 --> 25:00.890
You have to start
looking out

25:00.934 --> 25:01.848
for yourself, Fernando.

25:01.891 --> 25:04.154
Level the playing field.

25:04.198 --> 25:06.287
All you have to do
is go back, apologize,

25:06.330 --> 25:07.897
tell him that
you'll stay on

25:07.941 --> 25:09.116
a few more days for free.

25:09.159 --> 25:10.378
And tomorrow
or the day after,

25:10.421 --> 25:12.511

I got to go.

41:27.267 --> 41:29.269
Hey, did you
see blanco?

41:29.312 --> 41:30.836
He's walking around
like the landlord.

41:30.879 --> 41:33.534
I thought you said Lechero
was going to take care of it.

41:33.578 --> 41:34.579
He will.

41:34.622 --> 41:35.797
How long has he
been saying that?

41:35.841 --> 41:37.495
Look, if you and Lechero
want to go around

41:37.538 --> 41:39.801
like an old married couple,
fighting this way or that...

41:39.845 --> 41:41.499
maybe you like it
in the kitchen.

41:41.542 --> 41:42.891
Hey, you be careful, huh?

41:42.935 --> 41:43.936
Then do something!

41:43.979 --> 41:45.285
Or the next
thing you know,

41:45.328 --> 41:47.635
you're gonna be taking orders
from Scofield.

41:52.161 --> 41:54.773
Some people stop
at nothing, huh?

41:54.816 --> 41:57.776
Uh...

41:57.819 --> 42:00.039
Yeah. I know.

42:00.082 --> 42:01.562
At least
we're back inside.

42:01.606 --> 42:05.914
Which, of course, is
exactly what you wanted.

42:05.958 --> 42:07.263
Isn't it?

42:07.307 --> 42:08.308
What are you talking about?

42:08.351 --> 42:10.266
You let the fox
into the henhouse.

42:10.310 --> 42:12.573
The only reason you gave up
Gretchen's name

42:12.617 --> 42:15.271
was so she could come in
and pull you out of the fire.

42:15.315 --> 42:17.535
You wanted me to give up
her name.

42:19.058 --> 42:21.756
You know it doesn't end
with her.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.236
Yeah, I do.

42:23.279 --> 42:25.281
The question is, how do you?

42:25.325 --> 42:28.284
How does a simple
fisherman seem to know

42:28.328 --> 42:30.330
so much about
the Company?

42:30.373 --> 42:33.681
When she comes back,
and she will...

42:35.596 --> 42:39.121
...what am I gonna say?

42:39.165 --> 42:41.689
You gonna do this or not?

42:42.908 --> 42:45.998
You can tell her
the answer is yes.

42:46.041 --> 42:47.826
But once we're out,
I consider

42:47.869 --> 42:49.479
you collateral...

42:49.523 --> 42:51.699
nothing more.
