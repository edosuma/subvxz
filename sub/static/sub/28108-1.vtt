01:41.869 --> 01:44.136
Rosendo can be our cheerleader.

01:46.273 --> 01:49.241
Shut up, A.J!
I don't wanna be in your stupid team.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.743
Whatever, last pick.
My team is the winning team.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.746
You can go find

He's actually pretty fast.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.769
Whatever.
I'm faster.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.371
Oh, you think so?

02:54.375 --> 02:55.707
I don't wanna race.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.876
This is just
a friendly foot race.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.545

another tackle like that

04:14.788 --> 04:16.321
I'll have you running laps

04:16.322 --> 04:17.822

04:17.825 --> 04:20.591

of karma, man.

05:55.622 --> 05:56.955
Let's roll.

05:56.957 --> 06:00.726
No one throws toilet roll
like you.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.594
I'm just waiting for some fools
that owe me money.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.597
I mean, you guys handle tonight.

- So you're not going?
- For what?

06:09.470 --> 06:10.969
I'm not even racing.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.838
Well, the coach
still wants you to be there

06:12.840 --> 06:14.573
even if you're ineligible.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.575
Anyway, I think I see them.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.876

14:16.256 --> 14:17.589
You know it's hard for me.

14:17.591 --> 14:20.358
I have to work.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.893
But I'll try, okay?

14:21.895 --> 14:23.228
Either way,

14:23.230 --> 14:25.396
good luck on the race today.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.232
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.400
I love you.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.002
I love you, too.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.606
'm gonna kick your ass.

14:34.608 --> 14:36.040
Rosie.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.512
Hey.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.514
You guys better settle down.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.350
Where's your coach anyway?

14:45.352 --> 14:47.218
Uh, our coach
is meeting us there.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.220
Well, then who's in charge?

14:49.222 --> 14:51.256
Um, the boys coach, Coach Menlo.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.591
All right, well,

14:53.593 --> 14:56.060
I'm giving him five minutes,
then I'm calling the district.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.629
- All right?
- He'll be here.

14:57.631 --> 14:59.264
Yeah, he's just a little late.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.200
Wait.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.337
BOY:
Look, here comes Coach.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.339
Come on.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.313
Sorry, boys.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.982
Whoa Coach, are you hungover?

15:50.984 --> 15:54.218
Nah.
Just... I couldn't sleep.

15:54.220 --> 15:57.188
Besides,
I don't drink alcohol anymore.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.357
- Why not?
- Allergic.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.693
It causes me take off my clothes
and act like an a-hole.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.962
So is that why
you don't have a girlfriend?

16:03.964 --> 16:06.030
He doesn't have a girlfriend
'cause he's broke.

16:06.032 --> 16:08.099
All possible answers.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.367
Anyone else?

16:09.369 --> 16:10.969
Is it because
you have a fat belly...

16:10.971 --> 16:12.670
All right, all right, shut up.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.273
Let's get moving before you
say something hurtful.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.474
We gotta close that gap.

16:49.476 --> 16:50.675
ANNOUNCER:
In first place,

16:50.677 --> 16:52.543
last year's defending champs...

16:52.545 --> 16:54.078
Orange Coast High School.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.246
Give it up.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.123
Nice.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.790
JV gets medals too, uh?

17:06.792 --> 17:08.192
Huh, nice outfit.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.162
Nice ponytail.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.563
Let's go.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.534
I hate those guys.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.703
Dude, those guys
are good every year.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.472
- Man, they're tall.
- Ah, that doesn't matter.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.340
You saw that guy who won
the L.A. Marathon, right?

17:23.343 --> 17:25.609
He was short.
Prefontaine was short.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.679
And Prefontaine had a mustache
like mine, right Coach?

17:28.681 --> 17:32.250
Yeah, except he didn't
have his by Jr. High.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.718
But seriously,
we gotta get psyched.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.820
We're coming off a strong summer
with our best team yet.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.356
Your senior captain, Rosie,

17:38.358 --> 17:40.391
- third place today...
- All right, Rosie.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.492
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

17:41.494 --> 17:43.094
you all run hard.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.595
I like that.
Hey,

17:44.597 --> 17:46.597
did I ever tell you guys
about my first love?

17:46.599 --> 17:48.299
SIMON:
What was her name?

17:48.301 --> 17:49.801
- It wasn't a her.
- JULIO: A him?

17:49.803 --> 17:52.336
Nah, come on cabron, no, no, no.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.405
Here, hold this.
Mira.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.211
- ALL: Oh!
- SIMON: That's badass.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.713
Yeah.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.248
Running.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.750
Running was my first love.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.452
Before I even dated girls,

18:07.454 --> 18:08.753
I was XC to the core.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.456
Wait, we can date girls, Coach.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.157
You should see me at
school, I mean,

18:13.159 --> 18:15.326
- I'm picking up all the time.
- JULIO: Shut up, Simon.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.562
Simon, I love your jokes, man,
but listen, seriously,

18:17.564 --> 18:20.631
this can be
our best season yet...

18:22.402 --> 18:24.535
our championship season.

18:24.537 --> 18:25.870
Hmm?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.738
(HORN HONKING)

18:27.740 --> 18:30.541
Hey, you hear that?

18:30.543 --> 18:32.543
- You guys want some ice cream?
- ALL: Hell, yeah.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.545
Yeah, how 'bout some
paletas, right?

18:34.547 --> 18:36.681
Yeah, why not.
What flavor do you want?

18:36.683 --> 18:38.116
(YELLING OUT FLAVORS)

18:38.118 --> 18:40.418
Well go, go get 'em.
Go, go.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.487
Are you guys kidding, really?

18:42.489 --> 18:43.821
Three miles from everyone.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.591
Put your things down.
JV, gimme two.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.193
(MIXED CHATTER)

18:53.433 --> 18:55.800
Why you guys smiling? Huh?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.468
Let's listen up, all right?

19:07.447 --> 19:10.281
Responsibility.

19:10.283 --> 19:13.618
You guys have a responsibility

19:13.620 --> 19:16.454
with my team.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.623
One gets hurt,

19:18.625 --> 19:22.193
and we all get hurt.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.728
And boy, did you guys hurt

19:23.730 --> 19:25.329
the wrong one this time.

19:27.734 --> 19:30.434
So much hard work

19:30.436 --> 19:33.204
so you guys can just fuck it up!

19:35.642 --> 19:36.874
Do you think I'm just here

19:36.876 --> 19:39.744
just because this is fun for me?

19:39.746 --> 19:41.479
Huh?

19:42.949 --> 19:44.482
We're out

19:44.484 --> 19:45.883
our starting quarterback.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.388
Do you know what that does?

19:53.193 --> 19:55.760
I swear,

19:55.762 --> 19:58.396
you guys
really blew it this time,

19:58.398 --> 19:59.797
and I'm gonna
make you pay for it.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.435
I want you out there

20:04.437 --> 20:07.438
ready for a hard practice

20:07.440 --> 20:09.507
as soon as Coach Cruz
is done with you.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.780
A hundred gassers,

20:15.782 --> 20:18.316
in the sun, all of 'em.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.518
If any of these runts puke,

20:20.520 --> 20:21.752
start over.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.226
All right, you guys heard him.
You brought it upon yourselves.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.628
I want you guys on the field
in less than five minutes.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.904
Now, I know a lot of you kids

20:39.906 --> 20:41.706
just don't like math,

20:41.708 --> 20:44.242
but come on, guys.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.576
I like math, Miss Rios.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.911
Yeah, right.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.913
And specially for you
seniors in here,

20:48.915 --> 20:51.249
you have to pass Algebra

20:51.251 --> 20:52.950
if you want to graduate.

20:52.952 --> 20:53.951
Okay?

20:53.953 --> 20:56.654
Now A.J,

20:56.656 --> 20:59.023
don't be afraid to ask
for help, okay?

20:59.025 --> 21:02.026
I'm available before and
after school for tutoring.

21:02.028 --> 21:05.596
BILLY: Miss Rios, you can
um, you can tutor me?

21:05.598 --> 21:07.932
RYAN: No, no, I need home tutoring.
I need you to come to my house.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.700
I need sextra credit.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.042
As a matter of fact,
why don't you boys

21:18.044 --> 21:20.044
come up to my desk
and I'll give you a little slip

21:20.046 --> 21:23.047
for some "private tutoring,"

21:23.049 --> 21:25.049
some one-on-one time.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.550
- Come on.
- Let's go, dude.

21:26.552 --> 21:28.919
I'm first. I'm first.
No, no, no.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.298
Here you boys go.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.633
Plenty of study time
in detention.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.702
Now go see your counselors.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.773
(PERIOD BELL SOUNDING)

21:48.775 --> 21:50.374
(MIXED CHATTER)

22:06.392 --> 22:07.858
Let's go!

22:07.860 --> 22:10.461
Ay, you guys want some milk
for those cookies?

22:13.099 --> 22:15.099
They're weak, man.
They're weak.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.801
I don't even know
why they're in here.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.502
I'll tell you one thing,

22:18.504 --> 22:20.738
- somebody egged my house again.
- Again?

22:20.740 --> 22:22.673
- Again.
- That's the second time this week.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.843
I know. I'm gonna find the son
of a bitch who egged my house

22:25.845 --> 22:28.045
and I'ma take a shit
on his lawn, man.

22:29.382 --> 22:31.048
But seriously, I mean, come on.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.750
She doesn't even
let you get a piercing.

22:32.752 --> 22:35.086
Exactly.
Man, that's gonna freakin' hurt.

22:35.088 --> 22:37.355
I'll catch you guys outside.

22:37.357 --> 22:40.458
Oh, just because you can
google concussion,

22:40.460 --> 22:42.626
you think you're a doctor now?

22:42.628 --> 22:45.396
Go gear up, and let us
worry about stuff like that.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.368
- Unbelievable fatass.
- Kids, man.

22:50.370 --> 22:51.836
Ay, Coach,
can I talk to you for a minute?

22:51.838 --> 22:53.838
Um, one sec, A.J.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.140
You know what,
go set up the cones for practice.

22:56.142 --> 22:57.942
I gotta talk to Cruz real quick.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.543
Yes, sir.

23:02.148 --> 23:03.748
Sorry, sorry.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.486
Would any of you fine gentlemen

23:08.488 --> 23:10.755
tell me why there's football
equipment in my office?

23:11.891 --> 23:13.457
You got evicted, Menlo.

23:13.459 --> 23:16.927
JV Coach Sanchez
needed an office.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.963
- So...
- I see.

23:18.965 --> 23:21.599
Yep so, uh,
all your little pink ribbons,

23:21.601 --> 23:23.467
you can go
and hang those somewhere else.

23:23.469 --> 23:25.136
How 'bout that?

23:25.138 --> 23:26.670
Find another chalkboard,
homeboy!

23:26.672 --> 23:29.006
(LAUGHING)

23:29.008 --> 23:31.475
Well, you guys are really funny.

23:31.477 --> 23:34.445
Uh, let me bend over like the
rest of the administration

23:34.447 --> 23:35.913
and just give you
everything you want.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.882
Um, excuse me?

23:37.884 --> 23:39.984
How long you been teaching here?

23:39.986 --> 23:42.720
Oh that's right, you don't.

23:42.722 --> 23:45.890
Cruz, Sanchez, myself,

23:45.892 --> 23:47.558
we're teachers.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.893
We've earned this.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.729
- Online masters, homeboy.
- That's right!

23:51.731 --> 23:54.732
- Fall of 2016!
- Pop that collar!

23:54.734 --> 23:57.067
You're just trying
to figure this shit out.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.603
Ay, uh, I gotta ask you a question
though, man, straight out.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.506
You don't get embarrassed
driving that old wagon around,

24:02.508 --> 24:04.475
that national lampoon
thing, huh?

24:04.477 --> 24:06.444
Nope.

24:06.446 --> 24:07.778
That thing...

24:07.780 --> 24:09.613
that thing has character.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.482
Oh that's right,

24:11.484 --> 24:14.585
losing teaches character,
right Menlo?

24:14.587 --> 24:16.454
You know what's funny, man,
is you've got the most character

24:16.456 --> 24:17.922
in the whole school, man.
Way to go.

24:17.924 --> 24:20.624
I'm proud of you, dawg.
You... Right here!

24:20.626 --> 24:22.626
Good luck.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.495
There's the door.

24:24.497 --> 24:25.729
Yeah.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.168
Get the hell outta here.

24:34.907 --> 24:37.775
Hey!
Goddamnit!

24:37.777 --> 24:40.678
Everyone still in here
is gonna owe me 50 up-downs.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.112
Let's go!

24:42.114 --> 24:43.647
You guys, get to practice, too.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.115
Screw you, you're not my coach.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.718
Ay, you defiant little...
Come here, you little punk!

24:50.623 --> 24:52.790
A.J, come on!

24:52.792 --> 24:55.493
You and Jimmy should
have the cones set up by now.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.528
And why the heck you dressed
for practice anyway?

24:57.530 --> 25:00.531
Well, Coach, I was hoping
I could do some workouts today,

25:00.533 --> 25:02.833
maybe bleachers, or anything
you need me to do to stay fit...

25:02.835 --> 25:05.135
For what?
You're no use to us out there.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.604
Your season's done.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.772
I-I know, but, um,

25:08.774 --> 25:10.541
maybe I can recover
for college ball.

25:10.543 --> 25:12.610
Ha ha!
College ball?

25:12.612 --> 25:15.112
That's a whole
nother level of football,

25:15.114 --> 25:16.647
and I'm sorry
to break it to you,

25:16.649 --> 25:18.649
but size does matter, kid.

25:18.651 --> 25:20.651
But I mean, you said...

25:20.653 --> 25:22.887
I am the Valley's leading
quarterback in passing yards,

25:22.889 --> 25:25.222
touchdowns,
and All-League City MVP...

25:25.224 --> 25:27.958
Yeah, the city of El Monte,

25:27.960 --> 25:29.293
not Dallas, Texas.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.829
Look, A.J,

25:31.831 --> 25:33.264
you're a good athlete, no doubt.

25:33.266 --> 25:35.533
You ruined your chances

25:35.535 --> 25:37.701
when you acted reckless.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.940
A.J, son...

25:42.942 --> 25:45.943
you're still part of the team.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.545
Come along for the ride.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.015
I, I wanted to be a champ.

25:51.017 --> 25:53.584
You are a champ, champ.

25:53.586 --> 25:54.919
But what are you gonna do, huh?

25:54.921 --> 25:56.287
- I've...
- Hold that thought.

25:56.289 --> 25:58.889
I gotta take a piss
before practice.

26:00.626 --> 26:03.027
And take these towels outta here.
They smell like ass!

26:18.110 --> 26:20.044
(MIXED CHATTER)

27:06.926 --> 27:08.626
- Good job!
- Good job!

27:08.628 --> 27:10.894
(MUSIC PLAYING)

27:33.419 --> 27:35.953
Ay, I thought
you were too cool to run.

27:35.955 --> 27:37.855
Yeah, looking
a little tired there, A.J.

27:37.857 --> 27:40.024
Legs burning a little bit, man?

27:40.026 --> 27:41.892
Too... tired...

27:41.894 --> 27:44.895
need... water.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.897
And about a mile to go

27:46.899 --> 27:50.300
and still no cheerleaders.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.269
Later dick.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.038
See you at the finish line, bro.

27:58.110 --> 28:01.045
(MUSIC PLAYING)

28:35.314 --> 28:36.914
That's all you guys got?

28:41.921 --> 28:43.854
What the hell happened
to you guys?

28:45.224 --> 28:47.024
ANNOUNCER:
Third and 19

28:47.026 --> 28:49.093
for Monte Valley...

29:02.241 --> 29:03.774
Listen up,

29:03.776 --> 29:06.443
we have our first
league meet in two days,

29:06.445 --> 29:09.046
so today we're doing a nice
five-mile tempo run.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.380
Pace yourselves,

29:10.382 --> 29:12.850
I don't want anyone sore
on race day, okay?

29:18.958 --> 29:21.258
(MIXED CHATTER)

29:21.260 --> 29:23.460
COACH MENLO: Eddie,
you're varsity this week,

29:23.462 --> 29:25.395
so don't hot dog it, all right?

29:25.397 --> 29:27.431
So, go ahead
and warm up into it.

29:27.433 --> 29:30.334
I'll meet you guys
back at the finish.

29:33.839 --> 29:35.239
Well, warm up.

29:37.042 --> 29:38.175
Hey, Coach.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.912
Sit down.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.147
Hello there.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.417
Well, well,

29:47.419 --> 29:49.453
looks like we got
a new kid on the team.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.422
You are A.J?

29:52.424 --> 29:53.824
Yes, sir.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.326
A.J...

29:56.328 --> 29:59.129
these are our XC boys.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.131
We're doing a five mile run.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.466
Okay?

30:02.468 --> 30:04.067
Go ahead and jump in.

30:11.277 --> 30:14.011
Coach,
that's A.J. Montoya.

30:16.282 --> 30:17.514
I know.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.061
Whoa, too fast.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.565
What happened
to pacing ourselves?

30:34.567 --> 30:36.099
All right, grab some water.

30:36.101 --> 30:38.836
Everybody, go ahead
get some water.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.370
A.J, come here.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.407
A.J, not bad.

30:43.409 --> 30:46.910
So, I'm thinking we'll try you in the J.V.
race this week to...

30:46.912 --> 30:50.214
I don't do JV.
Trust me, I'm varsity.

30:50.216 --> 30:52.850
Hmm, that means
top seven fastest...

30:52.852 --> 30:53.917
Yes, sir.

30:57.156 --> 30:58.455
Okay.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.525
I like that attitude.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.527
We'll see what you got.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.896
Go get some water and stretch.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.130
Yes, sir.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.003
- Coach.
- Yep.

31:13.005 --> 31:15.005
He's a football player,
he's not one of us,

31:15.007 --> 31:16.640
and he doesn't deserve
to run with us.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.375
Why not?
He seems committed.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.911
Let's give him a shot.

31:20.913 --> 31:22.246
He...

31:22.248 --> 31:23.480
- He's a...
- Rosie.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.618
Can the kid run?

31:30.189 --> 31:31.588
Let's give him a shot.

31:33.025 --> 31:34.424
Snap out of it.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.668
If you're looking for Linda,
she just stepped away.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.270
- She did?
- Mm-hmm.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.375
I can wait.

31:53.212 --> 31:56.213
Hey, you coach
the cross country boys,

31:56.215 --> 31:57.981
- don't you?
- Yeah...

31:57.983 --> 31:59.116
I'm Miss Rios.

32:01.387 --> 32:03.387
- Miss Rios.
- Mm-hmm.

32:03.389 --> 32:05.923
I, uh, hear really
good things about you.

32:05.925 --> 32:08.258
Oh yeah, like what?

32:08.260 --> 32:11.395
Like, uh...

32:11.397 --> 32:14.431
you're a really great teacher.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.600
Okay, that, uh,

32:16.602 --> 32:18.468
- that you're very pretty.
- Ah.

32:18.470 --> 32:21.505
But, you are a really great
teacher too, right?

32:21.507 --> 32:23.373
- Right?
- God.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.976
Is that the only impression
I'm leaving on these kids?

32:27.947 --> 32:29.446
By the way,
I hear we have a really great

32:29.448 --> 32:31.348
- cross country squad this year.
- Actually, we do.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.216
- Thanks for noticing.
- Mm-hmm.

32:33.218 --> 32:35.352
Seems like all everybody
cares about around here

32:35.354 --> 32:36.687
is football.

32:36.689 --> 32:39.222
Well, I like running.

32:39.224 --> 32:41.058
I ran my first
marathon last month?

32:41.060 --> 32:43.126
Oh wow!
Ever think about coaching?

32:43.128 --> 32:44.461
That's where
all the big money's at.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.464
Funny, my boyfriend
said the same thing.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.066
Great.

32:51.103 --> 32:52.536
Hey!

32:52.538 --> 32:55.672
My favorite person
in the whole wide world...

32:55.674 --> 32:57.207
every other Friday.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.408
Uh, check please.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.285
Thank you, beautiful.

33:08.287 --> 33:10.087
It was a pleasure
talking with you.

33:10.089 --> 33:12.255
I have an appointment to get to.

33:12.257 --> 33:13.590
Oh of course, likewise.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.625
Have a good season.

33:37.783 --> 33:41.451
(MUSIC PLAYING)

33:51.196 --> 33:52.729
He's gonna get it!
Come on!

34:18.791 --> 34:20.389
You win some, you lose some.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.362
All right,
let's get outta here, guys.

34:25.364 --> 34:26.696
Yeah, we're gonna go to
"The Boat."

34:26.697 --> 34:28.231
- Chavita.
- Yeah.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.565
We're gonna go to
"The Boat."

34:29.568 --> 34:31.835
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute!

34:31.837 --> 34:33.837
Wait, there's... what about
the Late Daily Double?

34:33.839 --> 34:35.371
There's two more races left...

34:35.373 --> 34:37.139
Enjoy the suite, Coach.

34:53.324 --> 34:55.659
Hey, watch out for these fools
from South Sierra, man.

34:55.661 --> 34:58.361
- They race dirty.
- What do you mean dirty?

34:58.363 --> 35:00.363
You know, throwing elbows,

35:00.365 --> 35:02.365
clipping heels...

35:02.367 --> 35:03.700
they're pricks,

35:03.702 --> 35:05.869
and they beat us every year.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.571
Forget the other teams, bro.

35:07.573 --> 35:10.440
But headbands and black jerseys,

35:10.442 --> 35:11.741
go after them.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.182
Everybody take one step back.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.589
Runners set.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.798
Don't get too excited, A.J!

35:39.304 --> 35:41.304
Make sure you get their splits
at the mile mark.

35:41.306 --> 35:42.305
Okay, come on.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.640
They're going out fast.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.562
(CROWD CHEERING)

36:12.738 --> 36:15.739
4:54, 4:55.
4:56.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.541
Easy Rosie, easy.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.240
There.

36:50.242 --> 36:51.741
Come on, guys!
Dig, dig!

36:51.743 --> 36:53.310
We got a quarter mile left!

36:55.814 --> 36:58.515
Let's go, Rosie.
Come on, guys.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.283
Hang on, A.J!

37:01.920 --> 37:03.453
RALPHIE:
A.J.'s falling back, Coach.

37:03.455 --> 37:05.822
Ralphie, gimme a quick score.

37:05.824 --> 37:08.425
Um, I don't know...

37:08.427 --> 37:09.826
it's close.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.988
It's like seven points.

37:39.358 --> 37:40.757
- They got us.
- Ugh!

37:43.395 --> 37:44.594
Come on.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.743
Yo, wait up.

37:59.745 --> 38:01.911
You guys going
to The Post or what?

38:01.913 --> 38:03.513
- Breadsticks?
- I got a full ride, man.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.382
Dick, we'll lap it, man.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.583
Scoot over, Ryan.

38:06.585 --> 38:08.918
Ay, A.J, A.J, A.J, A.J...

38:08.920 --> 38:10.654
it's tight, bro.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.656
ERNIE: You can meet
us there if you want.

38:12.658 --> 38:13.990
(LAUGHING)

38:13.992 --> 38:16.326
Ah, you're a runner, run there.

38:16.328 --> 38:18.395
Run, Forrest, run!

38:26.738 --> 38:28.805
You been waiting for me?
I'm sorry.

38:31.410 --> 38:34.044
Let's go watch a movie,
what do you say?

38:34.046 --> 38:36.746
I'm actually going to the mall
with the girls in a bit.

38:36.748 --> 38:40.450
Oh, the girls, hitting up
Victoria's Secret again, huh?

38:40.452 --> 38:42.519
Yup.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.387
Poor guy, dude.
His stomach's probably turning.

38:44.389 --> 38:46.056
- Do you think he's gonna cry?
- Hands are probably shaking.

38:46.058 --> 38:48.758
Absolutely.
How long have they been together?

38:48.760 --> 38:50.460
- Absolutely.
- You've seen him cry at games

38:50.462 --> 38:52.329
when he loses.
Imagine him losing a girl now.

38:52.331 --> 38:54.564
- Ay, he's an emotional dude.
- Aw man, this is perfect.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.833
I mean, football's cool.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.968
I don't know what's going on
half of the time,

38:58.970 --> 39:01.071
- but Track?
- Cross Country

39:01.073 --> 39:04.007
Cross Country, whatever...

39:04.009 --> 39:05.542
who does that?

39:05.544 --> 39:07.877
Look, A.J,

39:07.879 --> 39:09.746
it was just time.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.481
We're changing, the both of us.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.083
I'm still the same guy.

39:13.085 --> 39:14.451
I know.

39:14.453 --> 39:15.952
Here.

39:15.954 --> 39:18.488
I just don't want us
to be awkward around campus.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.890
I mean,
we have the same friends.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.394
BILLY: Yo, get you phone
out, get your phone out.

39:24.396 --> 39:26.696
- No, I can't record...
- Come on, you got to.

40:15.814 --> 40:18.581
Come on guys, get up here!

40:22.654 --> 40:23.987
Time to party!

40:23.989 --> 40:25.755
Wooo!

40:41.039 --> 40:43.006
- Ay.
- This sucks.

40:43.008 --> 40:44.874
It was rough, I know.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.743
But forget about this race.

40:46.745 --> 40:48.912
We got the League meet coming up
in a few days.

40:48.914 --> 40:51.781
Hey, we need that win
to set us up for League Finals.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.716
Right now,
just cool down with your team.

40:53.718 --> 40:55.785
- Come on.
- My team?

40:55.787 --> 40:57.120
We suck!
I got last!

40:57.122 --> 40:59.656
Hey, don't say that.

40:59.658 --> 41:00.990
Don't say that.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.826
We don't become champs
overnight.

41:02.828 --> 41:05.628
You gotta put in
a lot of hard work.

41:05.630 --> 41:08.631
We gotta learn
how to bounce back up.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.633
What am I doing here?

41:34.826 --> 41:36.025
Yeah dude so, I mean,

41:36.027 --> 41:37.527
I think she likes me.
You know?

41:37.529 --> 41:38.962
Dude, just because she borrowed

41:38.964 --> 41:40.964
a pencil from you
does not mean she likes you.

41:40.966 --> 41:42.599
I bet she doesn't even
follow you on Instagram.

41:42.601 --> 41:43.833
SIMON: Dude, come on!
She could've asked

41:43.835 --> 41:45.268
anyone in the class
for a pencil,

41:45.270 --> 41:47.270
- but she chose me.
- CHAD: All right, listen,

41:47.272 --> 41:49.739
have you even talked to her
outside of class?

41:49.741 --> 41:52.675
- SIMON: Not really, but...
- JULIO: Exactly, exactly,

41:52.677 --> 41:54.177
- thank you.
- This is a start. It's an opening.

41:54.179 --> 41:55.912
Yeah!
See, Tito gets it.

41:55.914 --> 41:57.947
Nah.
Rosie, what do you think?

41:57.949 --> 42:00.049
Do you think she likes Simon?
I mean...

42:00.051 --> 42:02.085
Ay, Rosie?

42:16.801 --> 42:20.003
(MIXED CHATTER)

42:23.141 --> 42:25.275
- You forgot this the other day.
- Ay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:25.277 --> 42:27.544
What do you think you're doing?

42:27.546 --> 42:29.579
Uh, don't you running punks eat
together behind the dumpsters?

42:29.581 --> 42:30.713
Okay?

42:30.715 --> 42:32.315
I think I'm done
running for fun.

42:32.317 --> 42:35.685
- Ooh, that's right.
- So that's it?

42:35.687 --> 42:36.853
It's too hard for you?

42:36.855 --> 42:39.255
- Please.
- RYAN: Dude,

42:39.257 --> 42:41.291
do a real sport like football,
and then you can

42:41.293 --> 42:43.192
come talk to us.
Okay? All right?

42:43.194 --> 42:46.763
Shut up, Ryan.
You don't know shit.

42:46.765 --> 42:48.264
All you do is complain...

42:48.266 --> 42:50.633
"It's too hot today,
hell week is hard"...

42:50.635 --> 42:52.135
You know what?

42:52.137 --> 42:54.871
You wouldn't last one day
in cross country

42:54.873 --> 42:57.040
'cause cross country
takes balls.

42:57.042 --> 43:00.109
Ba... Cross country
is for pussies, dude.

43:01.880 --> 43:04.681
Come on, A.J.
Forget these guys.

43:04.683 --> 43:06.149
You're a good runner, A.J.

43:06.151 --> 43:07.951
Yeah, and let's face it,

43:07.953 --> 43:10.353
you're probably gonna miss
the whole football season so.

43:10.355 --> 43:12.355
Dude, don't listen
to these guys, okay?

43:12.357 --> 43:14.757
They're lames.

43:14.759 --> 43:17.660
I mean, come on, look at them.

43:17.662 --> 43:19.696
This guy don't even know
English.

43:21.733 --> 43:24.767
Honestly, what do you guys
know about winning anyways?

43:24.769 --> 43:26.102
All I see is a bunch of rejects

43:26.104 --> 43:28.237
who always find excuses.

43:28.239 --> 43:29.772
You punks got no fight.

43:29.774 --> 43:32.275
- You got no balls.
- RYAN: Ohh.

43:32.277 --> 43:34.277
Pussies, dude.

43:34.279 --> 43:35.812
You know what?

43:35.814 --> 43:36.980
Fuck you guys.

43:36.982 --> 43:39.115
Fuck all you football players.

43:39.117 --> 43:40.984
And you A.J,

43:40.986 --> 43:43.186
you're too chicken shit to even
stand out of your own group.

43:43.188 --> 43:44.954
You can go ahead

43:44.956 --> 43:46.289
and sit on those sidelines

43:46.291 --> 43:48.358
sobbing like a little bitch.

43:48.360 --> 43:49.892
We don't need you.

43:49.894 --> 43:51.060
You're a tough guy now,
huh, Rosie?

43:51.062 --> 43:52.829
Tougher than you.

43:52.831 --> 43:54.030
You guys better take
your friend away

43:54.032 --> 43:56.299
before he gets himself hurt.

43:59.671 --> 44:01.337
SIMON:
This is crazy shit, man.

44:01.339 --> 44:04.207
I've seen this backyard boxing
shit on WorldStar,

44:04.209 --> 44:05.908
and they get vicious quick.

44:05.910 --> 44:07.844
Boxing?

44:07.846 --> 44:10.813
You told me this was gonna be
a backyard kickback.

44:10.815 --> 44:14.250
Aren't you tired of these guys
calling us pussies?

44:14.252 --> 44:16.686
Ay pues cabron,
you better know how to fight, man.

44:16.688 --> 44:19.088
I wrestled sophomore year,
remember?

44:24.129 --> 44:25.828
You weren't that good.

44:25.830 --> 44:28.831
I don't remember
you winning a lot, man.

44:28.833 --> 44:31.167
I was okay and...

44:31.169 --> 44:32.869
you guys are supposed
to be pumping me up.

44:32.871 --> 44:34.737
- Dude, what do you want?
- All right, all right.

Yo! Hey!
What're y'all doing here?

45:54.886 --> 45:56.385

- That's nice,

45:56.387 --> 45:57.920
but y'all weren't invited,
so I mean...

45:57.922 --> 45:59.422
Yo Billy, it's cool, man.

46:12.170 --> 46:14.237

You here to box too or what?

46:14.239 --> 46:16.939
Chale. I'm just playing

I'm not gonna box you, man.

46:22.113 --> 46:23.780

46:23.782 --> 46:25.882
You guys should just go home.

RYAN:
No, no, no, no, no,

46:27.152 --> 46:29.018

46:29.020 --> 46:31.087

you gotta box.

46:35.927 --> 46:37.827

who's ready for a match.

46:37.829 --> 46:39.362
- Ryan.
- Wassup?

46:39.364 --> 46:42.265
You want some?

46:42.267 --> 46:44.967
Naaaah, nah, man,

Why don't you go for it?
You're acting all bad.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.013
Why don't you box him?

46:57.015 --> 46:59.282
Or...
I mean, uhh,

46:59.284 --> 47:01.150

some ladies over here.

to box this young gentleman?

47:05.456 --> 47:07.023
- He's only 105, about...
- No, leave it alone,

47:07.025 --> 47:08.357
leave it alone,
It's all good, Ryan.

47:08.359 --> 47:10.026
- I'm just saying.
- Fuck it, I'll fight.

47:10.028 --> 47:12.228
- Oh, damn.
- No, wait, hold on, Billy.

47:12.230 --> 47:15.231
- You'll box Bouncer then?
- Rosie no... Dude,

47:15.233 --> 47:17.033
we could find someone else to do this.
Billy, come on,

47:17.035 --> 47:18.434
there's like four or five
other people who can fight him.

47:18.436 --> 47:20.570
No, no. I wanna see this.
I wanna see this!

47:22.507 --> 47:24.373
I'ma go get him.

47:26.911 --> 47:29.345
Check it out.
Easy man, easy.

47:29.347 --> 47:31.514
What are you guys doing, man.

47:31.516 --> 47:33.516
You guys got the wrong glove,
on the wrong side.

47:33.518 --> 47:35.551
We don't box, man.

47:35.553 --> 47:37.486
- Ay Cuong.
- Yeah, what's up?

47:37.488 --> 47:39.288
He's not really
a bouncer, right?

47:39.290 --> 47:41.157
Nah. That's his gang name.

47:41.159 --> 47:43.860
Oh, don't worry.
He left the gang life when he was 12.

Uh, I don't know if anyone's
gonna bet against Bouncer, man.

47:51.069 --> 47:52.869
He looks kinda drunk.

47:52.871 --> 47:54.537
- I wanna bet.
- What are his odds?

47:54.539 --> 47:56.072
Fool, put your money away.
I'm not gonna take that.

47:56.074 --> 47:58.040
Neta! I wanna bet
that Rosie can last.

47:58.042 --> 48:00.977
- Hmm.
- That sounds good.

48:00.979 --> 48:03.646
All right.
I like that.

48:03.648 --> 48:06.415
We'll do bets on how long
my boy Rosie can last.

48:08.186 --> 48:10.253
All right Rosie, are you ready?

48:10.255 --> 48:12.188
Come on, get loose, get loose.

and go like this.

48:15.994 --> 48:17.994
What's that?

48:17.996 --> 48:20.263
I don't know, man.
Just do it.

48:20.265 --> 48:21.964
- I've seen it on TV.
- Yeah, move around a lot.

48:21.966 --> 48:23.299
Get him tired.
Tire him out.

48:23.301 --> 48:25.134
You're a runner, come on.

48:25.136 --> 48:27.536
Yeah, seriously, use your endurance.
Just keep moving.

48:27.538 --> 48:29.272
You can outrun him.
Just think it like that, okay?

48:29.274 --> 48:32.275
And no body shots.
Just clean shots to the face.

48:32.277 --> 48:33.609
Always make sure
to use both hands.

48:33.611 --> 48:35.611
You know, double punch,
you know, double power.

48:35.613 --> 48:37.213
- There you go.
- You got this, Rosie.

48:37.215 --> 48:38.447
Just keep doing that.
You got it, man.

keep doing this, Rosie?

50:25.356 --> 50:27.123
You know what?
Then you gotta change it up.

50:29.627 --> 50:32.294

You're sticking up for him?

- He's lost it man, bro.

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:35.016
I can't believe
that asshole cut him.

01:02:35.018 --> 01:02:37.185
I know. That's fucked up, dawg.
Football's his life.

01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:40.188
Coach Klingerman said he was
wasting space on his team.

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:41.890
How long has he been up there?

01:02:41.892 --> 01:02:43.612
- I don't know,
- like half an hour. Shit...

01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:51.399
He won't come down, dawg.

01:02:51.401 --> 01:02:52.934
Monkey boy,

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:54.436

Ooh,

It's, uh, pretty nice up here.

Hey, what do you say we go

01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:28.170
Honestly, who likes playing

01:03:38.582 --> 01:03:40.115
Yeah,

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:42.117
I've always admired you.

01:03:42.119 --> 01:03:44.419
Yeah, right.

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:46.388
I suck at football.

01:03:49.293 --> 01:03:50.826
There's so many people
in this world

01:03:50.828 --> 01:03:52.828
who go unnoticed,

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:54.496
'cause they're
not looking for fame

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:56.498
or medals.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.366
They just do what they gotta do,

01:03:58.368 --> 01:04:00.135
and they do it for others,

01:04:00.137 --> 01:04:01.369
like you.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:09.311
You know, when I busted my hand,

01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:11.313
I felt sorry for myself.

01:04:11.315 --> 01:04:13.148
But you never complain

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:16.017
when you're getting
hammered out there.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:17.252
You get back up.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:21.022
You, see the guys over there?

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:22.858
They're here

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.426
'cause you're a hero
to them, too.

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:30.332
They will always be
your team, Jimmy.

01:04:32.636 --> 01:04:35.337
And I'll always have your back.

01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:39.241
Now what do you say,
we get outta here,

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:40.542

01:13:23.099 --> 01:13:24.665
you might work for them one day.

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:26.167
All right, that's enough.
Everyone,

01:13:26.169 --> 01:13:28.169
let's just go back inside.
Let's have a good time.

01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:30.738
- All right?
- Who's this?

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.140
The captain
of the football team?

01:13:32.142 --> 01:13:34.075
- Yes sir, captain.
- Freakin' captain.

01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:36.077
You guys do know that after high
school, football's done.

01:13:36.079 --> 01:13:38.112
- It's over.
- LOBBY BOY COSTUME: You know what?

01:13:38.114 --> 01:13:41.115
They still got
the annual Turkey Bowls, dude.

01:13:41.117 --> 01:13:43.050
(CACKLING)

01:13:43.052 --> 01:13:45.420
Dude, I get it.

01:13:45.422 --> 01:13:46.754
I get it.
You guys used to be nerds.

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:47.989
Now you're all grown up,

01:13:47.991 --> 01:13:49.524
you can talk to girls.

01:13:49.526 --> 01:13:51.793
Congratulations.

01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:54.429
And you guys, what...
probably played JV Tennis?

01:13:54.431 --> 01:13:55.930
Bro, we should all just go.

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:57.532
A.J, A.J, A.J.

01:13:57.534 --> 01:13:59.867
A.J, you're not going with
them, are you?

01:13:59.869 --> 01:14:02.203
- Uh...
- We got a race tomorrow.

01:14:02.205 --> 01:14:03.971
And we're actually
going somewhere,

01:14:03.973 --> 01:14:06.674
not like your sad football team.

01:14:06.676 --> 01:14:08.676
Easy, Rosie.
We got a chance, right fellas?

01:14:08.678 --> 01:14:10.178
ALL: Yeah.

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.013
You think you're the shit
just 'cause you can run?

01:14:12.015 --> 01:14:14.882
No, we actually got futures,

01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:16.184
and all you know

01:14:16.186 --> 01:14:18.653
is football and partying.

01:14:18.655 --> 01:14:20.655
Well, enjoy it,
'cause it's gonna be

01:14:20.657 --> 01:14:23.191
the only highlight
of your sad life.

01:14:23.193 --> 01:14:25.793
Chill out, Rosie. Remember when no
one gave a damn about cross country?

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:27.962
So what?
I gotta thank you?

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:30.131
No, but I gave you a chance,
so did everyone else.

01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:32.133
We don't care what others think.

01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:34.001
You think we needed their love,

01:14:34.003 --> 01:14:37.004
'cause we sure as hell
didn't need yours.

01:14:37.006 --> 01:14:38.206
Is that so?

01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:43.010
All right, let's go.

01:14:48.618 --> 01:14:49.951
Rosie,

01:14:49.953 --> 01:14:51.552
what the hell just happened?

01:15:31.127 --> 01:15:32.894
Holy shit.

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:38.733
ANNOUNCER: We're just about
ready to start our next race.

01:15:38.735 --> 01:15:41.802
It'll be Boys Division I
Sectional Finals.

01:15:41.804 --> 01:15:44.872
All teams, you must have checked
in with the clerk of the course.

01:15:47.844 --> 01:15:49.176
Coach! Coach!

01:15:49.178 --> 01:15:50.811
Sorry I'm late, Coach!

01:15:50.813 --> 01:15:52.713
I'm here.
I'm ready to go!

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:54.682
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm here for the race.

01:15:54.684 --> 01:15:56.717
- I made it.
- Are you kidding me? You're not racing.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.185
- What?
- The race starts in five minutes.

01:15:58.187 --> 01:15:59.720
- You're not even ready.
- I'm warm.

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:00.888
I warmed up
from the parking lot,

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:02.123
I'm ready to go.
I got this, man...

01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:05.026
You're not racing, okay?

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:09.330
Come on, Ralphie!

01:16:09.332 --> 01:16:10.965

- We're in first place!
- We made it!

01:16:32.322 --> 01:16:34.355
- Yes!
- First place!

01:16:34.357 --> 01:16:36.357
Wooo!
But did you see us though?

01:16:36.359 --> 01:16:37.992
(CHEERING)

01:16:39.195 --> 01:16:41.028
- Hey!
- ALL: Yeah!

01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:42.363
Hey!

01:16:42.365 --> 01:16:44.365
Can you guys just
tear this thing down.

01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:47.068
- Oh shit!
- Hey!

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:50.371
Tear it down, and let's get
out of here like everyone else.

01:16:50.373 --> 01:16:52.239
I don't wanna be
the last one here.

01:16:52.241 --> 01:16:55.910
(MIXED CHATTER)

01:17:02.085 --> 01:17:04.619
All I'm saying is they better
have a pep rally for us though.

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:05.920
Yo, you think we'll make
the local Tribune?

01:17:05.922 --> 01:17:07.154
Hell yeah.

01:17:07.156 --> 01:17:10.758
You know why?
'Cause we got style.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.093
Those Orange Coast guys
ain't got nothin' on us.

01:17:12.095 --> 01:17:14.261
They can't touch us,

01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:16.263
a bunch of lame fools.

01:17:19.202 --> 01:17:20.968
Hey!

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:23.037
That's enough!

01:17:23.039 --> 01:17:25.272
Those "lame fools"

01:17:25.274 --> 01:17:27.141
kicked our butts today,

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:29.777
along with three other teams,

01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:31.112
and they're gonna do the same

01:17:31.114 --> 01:17:32.847
when we show up to State Meet

01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:34.181
and get last.

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:35.783
(SILENCE)

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:40.788
We're nobodies.

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:43.124
You guys are talking
like we're champions.

01:17:43.126 --> 01:17:45.259
We're not champions,

01:17:45.261 --> 01:17:46.794
and the way things are looking

01:17:46.796 --> 01:17:48.195
we're not even close.

01:17:51.968 --> 01:17:55.302
We didn't have our best
performance out there today.

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:57.238
And I know you guys
went out last night.

01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:01.142
Julio,

01:18:01.144 --> 01:18:04.812
your legs looked weak
out there today.

01:18:04.814 --> 01:18:06.714
Simon,

01:18:06.716 --> 01:18:08.049
you weren't even focused,

01:18:08.051 --> 01:18:10.718
and don't even get me
started on A.J,

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:13.688
don't even think
that I can't smell the alcohol

01:18:13.690 --> 01:18:15.089
on your breath.

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:19.026
I should...
you know what?

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:20.361
Don't even come to practice

01:18:20.363 --> 01:18:23.230
on Monday!

01:18:23.232 --> 01:18:24.832
You screwed up big time!

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:29.303
Everyone else,

01:18:29.305 --> 01:18:31.305
I don't wanna hear a peep

01:18:31.307 --> 01:18:32.907
on the bus ride home!

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:55.863
A.J.

01:18:55.865 --> 01:18:58.999
Hey, how you doing, son?

01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:00.901
Would you mind if we, uh,
talk for a minute?

01:19:02.505 --> 01:19:03.904
Sure, yeah.

01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:05.306
Let's go.

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:08.242
Football?

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:09.877
I'm not even healed yet.

01:19:09.879 --> 01:19:11.345
Doctor said it's gonna be

01:19:11.347 --> 01:19:13.881
- another month or two...
- Ah, don't listen to them.

01:19:13.883 --> 01:19:16.016
Doctors get paid
to play it safe.

01:19:16.018 --> 01:19:17.384
Look, son,

01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:19.754
I just wanna see
this season end right.

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:21.756
You know what I mean?

01:19:21.758 --> 01:19:23.257
Back with your friends that,
who knows,

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:25.192
might be playing their
last football game.

01:19:28.364 --> 01:19:31.866
You see that wall?

01:19:31.868 --> 01:19:33.267
I wanna see you up there.

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:37.905
You belong up there.

01:19:37.907 --> 01:19:41.308
Remembered as one of the best.

01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:43.844
We can do this.

01:19:43.846 --> 01:19:46.380
Or, just as easily...

01:19:49.552 --> 01:19:52.086
we can make it vanish.

01:19:52.088 --> 01:19:55.189
Gone, forgotten,

01:19:55.191 --> 01:19:57.424
like all the other nobodies
who come through here.

01:19:59.562 --> 01:20:00.995
It's up to you.

01:20:03.933 --> 01:20:06.000
I gotta go, Coach.

01:20:06.002 --> 01:20:07.468
Okay, it's good talking
to you, A.J.

01:20:10.406 --> 01:20:12.339

for your team.

- Ay, go Jimmy.
- Come on, Jimmy.

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:48.068

- Just go, Jimmy.

What's up, Menlo!

01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:15.596
Easy 50 bucks, right?
That's how we do.

01:22:15.598 --> 01:22:17.464
Yeah.

01:22:17.466 --> 01:22:19.300
I trip out on these things.
We got all these youngsters

01:22:19.302 --> 01:22:21.302
right here with their
high school crushes, man,

01:22:21.304 --> 01:22:23.037

I'm just sayin',

01:22:24.373 --> 01:22:25.706
and I'm just
putting it out there.

01:22:25.708 --> 01:22:27.708

to get me straight.

01:22:27.710 --> 01:22:29.243
Yeah, responsibility.

01:22:30.579 --> 01:22:32.579

01:22:32.581 --> 01:22:34.481

I like about you, Menlo?

Yeah, you're still the same guy.

but you stay straight.

Hey.

Those kids out there
are having a blast.

01:23:13.589 --> 01:23:16.290
I don't remember my school
dances being this fun.

01:23:16.292 --> 01:23:18.726
Nah, our school dances
consisted of dry humping.

01:23:22.698 --> 01:23:24.231

though, right?

01:23:43.586 --> 01:23:45.285
yeah, sometimes.

01:23:45.287 --> 01:23:48.288
It takes a lot of
commitment to be a coach...

01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:51.492
even teaching.

01:23:51.494 --> 01:23:54.028

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:56.363
how to connect
to some of the students.

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:59.233
I don't know if it's something
that I'm doing wrong,

01:23:59.235 --> 01:24:01.235
or maybe I should just focus

01:24:01.237 --> 01:24:03.103
on the ones who want to learn...

01:24:03.105 --> 01:24:05.172
Don't do that.

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:09.443

01:24:09.445 --> 01:24:11.745
but they don't know any better.

01:24:12.782 --> 01:24:16.150
They can even graduate,

01:24:16.152 --> 01:24:18.819
become adults,

01:24:18.821 --> 01:24:21.355
and still not know any better.

01:24:21.357 --> 01:24:23.724
Those will have to learn
the hard way.

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:26.593
I just hope I can leave
an impression on them.

01:24:26.595 --> 01:24:28.462
Oh, I...

01:24:28.464 --> 01:24:29.797
Yeah, they're gonna say,

01:24:29.799 --> 01:24:32.466
"Miss Rios changed my life...

01:24:32.468 --> 01:24:35.335
and she was smoking hot!"

01:24:35.337 --> 01:24:37.271
Oh my God.

01:24:39.842 --> 01:24:42.609
Ugh.

going back and becoming a teacher.

01:24:49.819 --> 01:24:51.351
I-I don't know.

01:24:51.353 --> 01:24:54.822
I-I-I feel like,

no band, no cheerleaders...

01:26:09.765 --> 01:26:11.765
just pure running.

01:26:11.767 --> 01:26:13.767

Really?

01:26:23.779 --> 01:26:25.546
That wasn't necessary, man.

Good stuff, good stuff.

01:26:36.392 --> 01:26:37.891
Glad you joined us, son.

01:26:37.893 --> 01:26:40.260
I didn't wanna have to
turn into a bad guy.

01:26:40.262 --> 01:26:41.762
Feels good to do
the right thing, Coach.

01:26:41.764 --> 01:26:43.830
Sure does, doesn't it?

01:27:20.836 --> 01:27:23.804

your South Pine eagles.

It's been an impressive year
so far with only the one loss.

01:27:44.994 --> 01:27:47.995
And the Monte Valley Vikings
are on the field now.

01:27:47.997 --> 01:27:50.664
With returning quarterback,
A.J. Montoya?

01:27:50.666 --> 01:27:52.432
You think he's gonna make
a difference?

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:54.301
You know, this is first
game back from injury,

01:27:54.303 --> 01:27:56.703
so we'll see if he can pick up
where he left off last season.

Here we go!

01:28:06.615 --> 01:28:09.316

Commentator #2" You think
Klingerman jumped the gun

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.647
- by starting him too early?
- He's not happy down there.

01:28:40.649 --> 01:28:42.349
Let's see what they're gonna do.

01:28:42.351 --> 01:28:45.018
Ramirez, warm up.

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:47.454
All right, Montoya,

01:28:47.456 --> 01:28:48.755

A late hit by the Eagles.

Come on.

I'm sorry, guys.

01:31:06.762 --> 01:31:10.063
I'm sorry it took me
this long to realize

01:31:10.065 --> 01:31:11.832
such a great team I had.

01:31:13.068 --> 01:31:15.502
I let myself down,
but most importantly

01:31:15.504 --> 01:31:17.838
I let you guys down.

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:19.706

to have you here.

hour before you go warm up.

Don't wander off too far.

01:32:39.154 --> 01:32:42.122
Shouldn't you give us a speech?

01:32:42.124 --> 01:32:43.823
What do you mean?
You guys know what to do.

01:32:43.825 --> 01:32:46.860
Yeah, but it's State.

01:32:46.862 --> 01:32:49.029
Shouldn't we have a plan
or something?

01:32:49.031 --> 01:32:51.164
This is my first time
at State Meet, too.

01:32:51.166 --> 01:32:52.832
You really think
we can win today, Coach?

Pfst! Yeah, heck yeah,

01:32:54.903 --> 01:32:57.037
we got a shot.

01:32:57.039 --> 01:33:00.206
Let's just go out there
and do what we always do.

01:33:00.208 --> 01:33:01.641
I think, uh...

01:33:04.279 --> 01:33:06.313
I think uh...

01:33:09.351 --> 01:33:11.918
You know what?

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.086
That's not true.

01:33:15.724 --> 01:33:17.657
- What if we all PR?
- Yeah

01:33:17.659 --> 01:33:19.960
I mean,
you gotta all PR by a lot.

01:33:22.064 --> 01:33:25.065
That first mile
is gonna be blazing.

01:33:25.067 --> 01:33:27.067
If we want a shot,
we gotta be there from the beginning.

01:33:27.069 --> 01:33:28.902
What about pacing ourselves?

01:33:28.904 --> 01:33:31.705
Yeah, I mean,
we can die if we go out too fast.

01:33:31.707 --> 01:33:33.039
Yeah, true,

01:33:33.041 --> 01:33:35.041
we can even lose
our chance at placing.

01:33:35.043 --> 01:33:37.277
But if we relax
and lose that lead pack...

01:33:39.081 --> 01:33:41.381
we'll never catch 'em.

01:33:41.383 --> 01:33:42.816
Ah...

You know,

01:33:53.929 --> 01:33:55.929
gambling isn't for everybody,

01:33:55.931 --> 01:33:57.931
losing hurts.

01:33:57.933 --> 01:33:59.966
God only knows I've
had my share of loses,

01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:01.868
mostly my fault.

01:34:03.238 --> 01:34:04.704
But then there are instances

01:34:04.706 --> 01:34:06.106
when things just fall in place.

too much time waiting

01:34:11.113 --> 01:34:13.179
for things
to fall into place for me.

You guys are my best bet.

01:34:20.255 --> 01:34:23.023
And yes.
Miracles are possible,

01:34:23.025 --> 01:34:24.357
but we gotta go out there

01:34:24.359 --> 01:34:26.726
and make those miracles
happen ourselves.

01:34:26.728 --> 01:34:27.894
Whatever happens,

01:34:27.896 --> 01:34:29.396
we can take it.

we pass out at the finish,
