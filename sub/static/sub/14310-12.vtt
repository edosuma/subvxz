your last trick.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.139
This time there is no escape.

11:29.159 --> 11:31.070
'Another, and another.'

11:31.090 --> 11:33.019
[Gargamel laughing]

11:33.039 --> 11:34.190
[meowing]

11:34.210 --> 11:37.129
I've got them.
I've got them all!

11:41.179 --> 11:45.059
Now, Azrael, we'll have a feast.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.120
'A smurf feast.'

11:47.139 --> 11:49.110
[Gargamel laughing]

11:49.129 --> 11:50.230
By smurf, how are we

11:51.009 --> 11:53.000
going to smurf ourselves
out of this one?

11:53.019 --> 11:55.230
Oh, you'll think of something,
Papa Smurf.

11:56.009 --> 11:57.169
I hate cupboards.

11:57.190 --> 12:02.190
Gee, Papa Smurf, it's all
my fault we're in this mess.

12:02.210 --> 12:06.039
Now, now, Dreamy,
don't blame yourself.

12:06.059 --> 12:10.000
If we only had the magic
whistle. That would save us.

12:10.019 --> 12:11.190
I have the whistle.

12:11.210 --> 12:16.029
Perfect. Everyone join hands.

12:16.049 --> 12:17.090
[blows whistle]

12:17.110 --> 12:18.230
poof

12:19.009 --> 12:22.059
Ah. The water is ready.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.009
[meows]

12:24.029 --> 12:26.200
Now for the main ingredient.

12:26.220 --> 12:29.000
[laughing]

12:29.019 --> 12:32.000
What? They're gone!

12:32.019 --> 12:34.100
I-I can't stand it anymore!

12:34.120 --> 12:38.059
[crying]
I can't. I can't.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.029
[Azrael meowing]

12:41.179 --> 12:45.220
Well, Dreamy, you didn't
get very far on your travels.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.039
Will you be smurfing off
again soon?

12:48.059 --> 12:52.200
Oh, no, Papa Smurf. I've had
plenty enough excitement.

12:52.220 --> 12:55.120
(Smurfs)
'Hooray!'

12:55.139 --> 12:57.110
At least for now.

12:59.220 --> 13:02.110
