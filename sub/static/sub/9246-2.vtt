00:04.787 --> 00:06.702
[exhales heavily]

00:08.182 --> 00:09.313
Damn it.

00:13.274 --> 00:14.405
Mike!

00:24.633 --> 00:25.808
Whoa!

00:28.332 --> 00:30.856
Screw it, I've touched his
underwear enough for one night.

00:39.691 --> 00:41.041
Mike!

00:46.916 --> 00:48.831
No, I got it!

01:10.026 --> 01:12.420
- Perfect.
- Molly!

01:12.507 --> 01:15.727
Someone's at the door!

01:15.814 --> 01:16.989
It's me!

01:19.601 --> 01:21.690
What are you doin' out there?

01:21.777 --> 01:25.346
Thinking about another load
I'd like to shove in the drier.

01:25.433 --> 01:28.697
Let me get that for you sweetie,
wow, this is heavy!

01:28.784 --> 01:31.656
It's because the clothes are
still damp because apparently

01:31.743 --> 01:34.485
your drier is actually
more of a slot machine.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.230
What the hell?

01:40.317 --> 01:43.407
This thing has been on 350 for
over an hour it's not even warm.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.670
Uh, that's because
350 means 150.

01:45.757 --> 01:47.672
If you want 350,
you got to put it on "clean."

01:49.848 --> 01:52.155
- What's broil?
- I don't know, Jewish holiday?

01:55.550 --> 01:57.639
So, basically I'm left

01:57.726 --> 01:59.554
with one pot
and one working burner.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.556
Ooh, sounds like
we're having chili tonight.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.344
I don't understand why we don't
just live at my house.

02:07.431 --> 02:09.607
- With your mom and sister?
- Why not?

02:09.694 --> 02:12.349
At least till we save up enough
money to buy our own place.

02:12.436 --> 02:15.091
But this is my home, I've lived
here for almost 15 years.

02:15.178 --> 02:16.962
And you still
only have one pot!

02:17.049 --> 02:19.008
I only have
one workin' burner.

02:20.923 --> 02:24.100
This apartment is not
big enough for two people.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.276
I mean, there's only
one closet, there's no

02:26.363 --> 02:27.799
counter space in the bathroom.

02:27.886 --> 02:30.889
I offered to put a TV tray
in there for you.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.630
Why don't you just move the one
you have next to the toilet?

02:32.717 --> 02:35.503
That's my reading table.

02:35.590 --> 02:37.635
Convenient, 'cause it's right
next to your thinkin' seat.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.900
Come on, just
consider it.

02:41.987 --> 02:44.816
I mean, everything
we need is at my house.

02:44.903 --> 02:47.254
Except privacy.
Here, it's just us.

02:47.341 --> 02:50.474
Our cozy little love nest,
our romantic pied-a-terre.

02:51.954 --> 02:54.478
[knocking at door]

02:54.565 --> 02:56.698
Oh, good, you're both here,
I brought hot wings

02:56.785 --> 02:58.047
and rodeo bloopers
for halftime.

02:58.134 --> 03:01.964
- Cool, Molly's making chili.
- Yay.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.291
it'll definitely
cut down on expenses.

03:24.378 --> 03:26.945
Plus, my neighborhood's not
exactly the safest for a woman.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.817
Why don't you get her a big dog
or teach her judo?

03:28.904 --> 03:30.732
- No, that's stupid.
- How is that stupid?

03:30.819 --> 03:32.908
I don't know, that's what
Molly said when I suggested it.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.260
Man, I hate to see you
get rid of that apartment.

03:37.347 --> 03:38.783
It's like a quiet
sanctuary for me.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.263
Why don't you sublet it,
that way you can

03:40.350 --> 03:41.873
move out of your
grandmother's house.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.484
Oh, I can't do that,
cooking and cleaning for me

03:43.571 --> 03:46.878
is what keeps
that old woman vital.

03:46.965 --> 03:50.621
- And the yard work?
- When did this become about me?

03:50.708 --> 03:51.970
You're the one
surrendering the fort.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.885
What're you talking about?

03:53.972 --> 03:55.844
You move in with Molly you're
giving up home field advantage.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.541
She's always shirts,
you're always skins.

03:57.628 --> 04:00.283
Man, nobody wants to see that.

04:00.370 --> 04:01.458
Yeah, that's true.

04:01.545 --> 04:03.068
With her sister
and mother there

04:03.155 --> 04:05.027
she'll always have
two women taking her side

04:05.114 --> 04:08.204
which means the outcome
of the vote is predetermined.

04:08.291 --> 04:11.033
Or as they call it
in my country, democracy.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.297
You know, and I understand
you want to save money

04:14.384 --> 04:15.646
but what good is money
if you can't

04:15.733 --> 04:17.996
sit on the toilet
with the door open?

04:18.083 --> 04:21.696
Or drink milk
right out of the cow.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.480
You mean carton.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.439
You Americans are so spoilt.

04:33.055 --> 04:35.927
Why does this frosting
taste funny?

04:36.014 --> 04:39.148
There's no pot in it.

04:39.235 --> 04:42.673
That's what it is.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.936
Hey, who's
the birthday cake for?

04:45.023 --> 04:46.895
Oh, Mike's
mother's boyfriend.

04:46.982 --> 04:50.246
Oof, still can't believe
that thing has a boyfriend.

04:50.333 --> 04:53.510
Well, lid for every pot,
ass for every saddle, I guess.

04:55.164 --> 04:56.905
[sighs]
I'm exhausted.

04:56.992 --> 04:59.951
Between Mike's chili trumpet
and the feral cat gangbang

05:00.038 --> 05:01.910
outside the window

05:01.997 --> 05:04.086
I only got
about three hours of sleep.

05:04.173 --> 05:06.175
Why didn't you guys
stay here last night?

05:06.262 --> 05:08.699
I'm trying to be fair
and stay a couple nights

05:08.786 --> 05:10.701
a week over
at his place.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.921
Plus, it'll toughen me up
if I ever have to

05:13.008 --> 05:15.793
survive in the wilderness or..

05:15.880 --> 05:17.752
...South American
women's prison.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.800
Men aren't sticklers
for hygiene, are they?

05:22.887 --> 05:25.673
The soap's always a pube-fest
and anything's a handkerchief.

05:27.457 --> 05:29.329
Yeah, but if a man's place
is too neat and clean

05:29.416 --> 05:31.592
you know he's either
married or gay.

05:31.679 --> 05:33.289
And in one awkward case, both.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.773
Well, we talked about it last
night, and I think I have got

05:38.860 --> 05:41.689
him convinced to give up his
place and come live with us.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.999
What?
Is that not okay?

05:48.086 --> 05:50.350
Are you talking about
him living here forever?

05:50.437 --> 05:52.874
Well, no, just until
we get married

05:52.961 --> 05:55.964
and save up enough money
to buy a home of our own.

05:56.051 --> 05:58.880
Sounds like forever to me.

05:58.967 --> 06:02.013
Wow, I never imagined you guys
would have an issue with this.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.885
I guess I'll just tell
Mike that my mom

06:03.972 --> 06:05.452
and my sister
don't want him here.

06:05.539 --> 06:08.672
No, honey.
We can make it work.

06:08.759 --> 06:10.892
We just need to come up
with some guidelines.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.197
Might want to think
about getting

06:12.284 --> 06:14.286
a television for the bedroom.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.245
I mean, for a guy
who doesn't smoke weed

06:16.332 --> 06:18.203
he sure watches a lot of TV.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.903
And he's gonna have to start
chippin' in for groceries.

06:21.990 --> 06:23.383
Well, of course.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.210
It should be
based on consumption.

06:25.297 --> 06:28.083
Not a, you know, flat rate,
all-you-can-eat type of deal.

06:30.302 --> 06:31.826
Yeah, and for a guy
who doesn't smoke weed

06:31.913 --> 06:34.829
he sure does
eat a lot of food.

06:34.916 --> 06:37.266
And I will say,
I'm more than a little nervous

06:37.353 --> 06:39.050
about there being
a gun in the house.

06:39.137 --> 06:41.357
Don't worry, I promise
that he will keep it locked up.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.794
Good, 'cause you know
how I get when I drink.

06:43.881 --> 06:46.536
And it would tear me apart if
anything happened to you girls.

that I don't already have?

07:03.510 --> 07:06.295
I'd request a little hearing
back in your right ear.

I'm tired of having
to throw my slipper at you

07:08.166 --> 07:09.298
to get your attention.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.434
Any attention from you
is good attention, Margaret.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.218
You're making it weird.
Just blow.

Indian corn.

07:31.712 --> 07:33.583
You know what,
no cake for me.

07:34.976 --> 07:37.805
This is so thoughtful.
Thank you.

07:37.892 --> 07:40.634
You get those talons corralled,
and come Christmas

07:40.721 --> 07:43.288
you might be unwrapping
a new pair of open-toed shoes.

07:45.334 --> 07:47.858
Ooh, you're planning
Christmas already.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.599
I think
that's really adorable.

07:49.686 --> 07:50.905
Well, your approval
is the reason

07:50.992 --> 07:54.996
I get out of bed
in the morning.

07:55.083 --> 07:59.000
Mmm, I do love lemon cake.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.305
I guess I've always enjoyed
sour things.

08:00.392 --> 08:01.611
That explains a lot.

08:01.698 --> 08:02.830
[Jim barking]

08:05.528 --> 08:08.096
I was joking.

08:08.183 --> 08:10.272
It's time for
his post-dinner squat.

08:10.359 --> 08:11.578
I'll take him, Margaret.

08:11.665 --> 08:13.362
Mikey, why don't you
go with him?

08:13.449 --> 08:16.104
Don't make the birthday boy
pick up a hot tootsie roll.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.978
- Can I take my cake?
- Ew, Mike.

08:21.065 --> 08:22.763
Oh, don't try
to break him of that.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.939
He used to eat ice cream
while he got his hair cut.

08:28.072 --> 08:30.248
You and Dennis seem
to be getting along great.

08:30.335 --> 08:32.816
I was wary of him at first
but he's proven

08:32.903 --> 08:35.297
himself to be
a fairly decent companion.

08:35.384 --> 08:37.212
Well, he pursued you
for seven years.

08:37.299 --> 08:40.432
That's clearly a man that
wanted him some Peggy Biggs.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.916
I stretched out the courtship
longer than most men would

08:46.003 --> 08:49.093
tolerate, but he kept
his powder dry

08:49.180 --> 08:50.878
and his eye on the prize.

08:50.965 --> 08:53.358
And tonight,
his patience will be rewarded.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.535
- How so?
- Carnally.

08:58.407 --> 08:59.582
Yikes.

08:59.669 --> 09:01.453
That's wonderful.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.935
Um, it's inspiring to know
that two people

09:05.022 --> 09:07.068
can find each other
this late in life.

09:07.155 --> 09:09.679
I'm sorry, is there a toe tag
on me I haven't seen?

09:09.766 --> 09:12.987
No, I'm just saying
it's nice to know

09:13.074 --> 09:15.598
there's many chapters
in the book of love.

09:15.685 --> 09:19.210
Yeah, well, this book hasn't
seen a bookmark for 30 years.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.867
And I'm a little nervous
about crackin' it open.

09:26.261 --> 09:29.873
Wow, 30 years.
It...could very well crack.

09:33.050 --> 09:36.097
I'm just so damn nervous, you'd
think it was my first time.

09:36.184 --> 09:38.882
I mean, look at me, I'm shaking
like a 14-year-old virgin.

09:38.969 --> 09:40.580
Fourteen?

09:40.667 --> 09:43.147
I grew up on a farm, we were
poor we had to make our own fun.

09:45.976 --> 09:49.066
You got to put
the banjo down eventually.

09:49.153 --> 09:52.156
And I'm afraid that
once Dennis satisfies his needs

09:52.243 --> 09:54.376
he's gonna hit the bricks,
and I'm just gonna be

09:54.463 --> 09:56.726
another notch
on his reversible belt.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.209
I understand that you're feeling
vulnerable, but tonight

10:01.296 --> 10:04.865
you gotta just trust your heart
and jump back on the horse.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.346
Back on the horse?

10:08.433 --> 10:10.610
Refresh me, is that the one
where the gal's on top

10:10.697 --> 10:12.263
but facing the other way?

10:16.746 --> 10:18.618
You know what,
I'm gonna have some cake.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.453
Not too bad for an old broad,
huh, Jim?

10:30.760 --> 10:33.981
Well, you'd love me
no matter what.

10:34.068 --> 10:36.723
You've seen me cry,
you've seen me naked.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.334
And you've sat on my lap while
I've done my morning business.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.165
Boy, it'd be
so much easier

10:44.252 --> 10:45.862
if I were a dog
or you were a man.

10:50.388 --> 10:52.434
Well...wish me luck.

10:56.438 --> 10:59.528
And again, I'm sorry
I had your testicles removed.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.839
Alright, Dennis, lights off..

11:05.926 --> 11:08.711
and keep your eyes closed till
I'm securely under the covers.

11:10.060 --> 11:12.584
And just a few ground rules.

11:12.672 --> 11:16.066
No biting, no spanking
and "hey, not there" means

11:16.153 --> 11:17.285
"hey, not there".

11:25.206 --> 11:27.512
Other than that,
enjoy my secret garden.

11:42.092 --> 11:43.398
Dennis?

11:46.836 --> 11:48.620
Dennis..

11:50.753 --> 11:52.581
It's a little late
to play hard-to-get.

11:57.629 --> 11:58.761
Den..

12:05.333 --> 12:06.508
Oh, my God!

12:08.205 --> 12:09.380

12:10.077 --> 12:11.643
Oh, no!

12:11.731 --> 12:13.776
Oh, my God,
this is terrible!

12:17.388 --> 12:18.955
Mikey?

12:19.042 --> 12:21.392
Something horrible's happened.

12:21.479 --> 12:23.351
Jim, stop it,
that is not a chew toy.

12:26.571 --> 12:27.703
I..

12:31.228 --> 12:32.142
[Mike]
'Mom!'

12:33.578 --> 12:34.841
[rapping on door]
'Mom!'

12:36.886 --> 12:38.105
Alright, mom,
what happened?

12:38.192 --> 12:39.323
I don't know.
He just died.

12:44.024 --> 12:46.896
What the hell did you
do to him, Peggy Biggs?

12:46.983 --> 12:48.506
Shh! Shh!

12:48.593 --> 12:52.336
I.. I came downstairs and...
saw him like this

12:52.423 --> 12:54.512
slumped in front of your
girlfriend's birthday cake.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.386
Alright, just calm down
and let me do what I do.

12:58.473 --> 13:02.085
You're wasting your time
that man is stone-cold dead.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.957
Why's he got all
this carpet fuzz in his hair?

13:04.044 --> 13:07.351
I don't know, he was probably
r-rolling a ball

13:07.438 --> 13:10.311
around on the floor
with Jim.

13:10.398 --> 13:13.618
His shirt's not buttoned right.
He's not wearing a belt.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.925
He's only got one shoe on.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.492
Listen,
if I wanted the fashion police

13:17.579 --> 13:20.625
I certainly wouldn't
have called you.

13:20.712 --> 13:23.106
Carl, I need you over
at my mom's place, ASAP.

13:23.193 --> 13:26.066
Why are you turning this
into a big CSI thing?

13:26.153 --> 13:28.503
Man had a piece of sour cake
and croaked.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.200
Just because he can't
button his shirt

13:30.287 --> 13:33.029
doesn't mean I'm a murderer!

13:33.116 --> 13:34.596
Molly, she's hysterical..
Do me a favor

13:34.683 --> 13:36.511
take her over to your house.

13:36.598 --> 13:37.860
So you're sticking
with the cake story?

13:37.947 --> 13:39.819
Mind your business,
Nancy Drew.

13:45.085 --> 13:47.391
Anything about that body
seem weird to you?

13:47.478 --> 13:50.177
I mean, other than
the nine-dollar haircut?

13:50.264 --> 13:53.136
Not really, you seen one
dead body, you seen 'em all.

13:53.223 --> 13:56.139
What about this
marking on the rug?

13:56.226 --> 13:58.489
Looks like somebody was dragging
something down the stairs.

13:58.576 --> 14:02.232
It's probably the dog
he's got itchy anal glands.

14:02.319 --> 14:04.060
And this carpet's really
just his personal

14:04.147 --> 14:06.323
wall-to-wall ass scratcher.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.499
No, something about
this doesn't add up.

14:08.586 --> 14:11.415
I mean, your mom claims she was
upstairs while he was down here.

14:11.502 --> 14:12.808
Eating cake
with only one sock on.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.549
Come on, who amongst
us hasn't eaten

14:14.636 --> 14:17.160
cake with
only one sock on?

14:17.247 --> 14:18.901
I'm just saying,
this crime scene

14:18.988 --> 14:20.207
has definitely
been tampered with.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.165
It's not a crime scene, Shaft.

14:22.252 --> 14:25.255
The coroner said
it was a heart attack.

14:25.342 --> 14:26.996
I'm not disputing
the cause of death.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.780
I'm just saying he didn't die
in those clothes

14:28.868 --> 14:31.131
in that chair eating
this cake.

14:31.218 --> 14:32.349
Lemon?

14:33.394 --> 14:35.004
Molly made it.

14:35.091 --> 14:37.137
Lemon for a birthday?

14:37.224 --> 14:39.052
I'm telling you,
none of this adds up.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.838
Yeah, whatever, we need
to go to his apartment

14:42.925 --> 14:44.318
try and locate any
next of kin

14:44.405 --> 14:46.102
see if he had
any sort of living will.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.278
Just follow me on this, is it
possible he could've died

14:48.365 --> 14:50.019
upstairs and your mom dragged
the body down here?

14:50.106 --> 14:51.586
Why the hell
would she do that?

14:51.673 --> 14:52.804
I'm just saying,
maybe he got more

14:52.892 --> 14:54.023
than a piece
of cake tonight.

14:57.809 --> 14:59.681
Crossed the line
there, didn't I?

15:04.947 --> 15:08.429
- You gonna be okay?
- I'm numb.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.997
I can't believe he's gone.

15:11.084 --> 15:13.695
Well, you gave him a wonderful
last birthday, and..

15:13.782 --> 15:16.437
...the only questionable
behavior was when you..

15:16.524 --> 15:18.656
...dragged his dead body
down the stairs

15:18.743 --> 15:21.921
and propped him up
in an eating position.

15:22.008 --> 15:25.228
I couldn't let Mikey
find him upstairs in my bed.

15:25.315 --> 15:27.752
One loose woman
in his life is enough.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.798
At least I held out past 14.

15:32.192 --> 15:34.237
[knocking at door]

15:34.324 --> 15:37.197
Hi, I just want to say I am

15:37.284 --> 15:39.025
very sorry for your loss.

15:39.112 --> 15:40.809
Thank you.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.898
If there's anything I can do
to help you through

15:42.985 --> 15:45.857
this difficult time,
like, say

15:45.945 --> 15:48.338
put makeup on your
recently deceased boyfriend..

15:48.425 --> 15:51.515
- Victoria.
- It's a very competitive field.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.691
We have an expression, "The
early worm gets the dead bird."

15:53.778 --> 15:55.737
Victoria!

15:55.824 --> 15:58.740
Cell phone number's on the back,
and consultations are free.

15:58.827 --> 16:00.524
Tell her I'll give her half
off on the next stiff.

16:03.527 --> 16:04.920
Sorry.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.096
Oh, Dennis..

16:07.836 --> 16:09.838
[crying]

16:12.841 --> 16:14.625
It's gonna be okay.

16:14.712 --> 16:18.412
Now, just try to focus on the
fun you two had and..

16:18.499 --> 16:20.370
...tonight must have
been nice, you know?

16:21.763 --> 16:23.678
Till he died.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.464
Never got that far.

16:27.551 --> 16:31.294
I guess the image of our
two naked bodies entwined as one

16:31.381 --> 16:33.993
was more than
his bum ticker could take.

16:37.213 --> 16:39.215
Yeah I know, had a little
palpitation myself.

16:41.739 --> 16:45.569
I made that poor man court me
for seven years.

16:45.656 --> 16:48.572
Well, you Biggs
like to take it slow.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.487
Oh, maybe I didn't want him

16:50.574 --> 16:53.403
to find out I wasn't perfect.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.405
I wanted to remain
that pristine

16:55.492 --> 16:57.755
alabaster goddess
that he fell in love with.

17:01.759 --> 17:04.240
Yeah, sure.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.720
You could tell from

17:05.807 --> 17:08.331
how he looked at you
that he loved you.

17:08.418 --> 17:11.595
- Really?
- Oh, are you kidding?

17:11.682 --> 17:14.511
Eyes lit up every time
you walked into the room.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.426
Mm.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.515
That's how Mikey looks
at you, you know.

17:18.602 --> 17:20.996
- Does he?
- Yup.

17:21.083 --> 17:24.347
He loves you so much, he's blind
to the glaring imperfections

17:24.434 --> 17:26.349
that the rest of us
see, oh, so clearly.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.573
So, when you dragged his body
down the stairs

17:32.660 --> 17:34.531
was it by his feet or his head?

17:39.928 --> 17:41.451
There's nothing around
here to indicate

17:41.538 --> 17:43.497
that Dennis lived any
kind of life at all.

17:43.584 --> 17:46.456
Yeah.

17:46.543 --> 17:51.157
Carl, does this apartment
seem familiar to you at all?

17:51.244 --> 17:53.159
Yeah. You
feeling it, too?

17:53.246 --> 17:54.508
'Cause I've been
deja vu-ing ever since

17:54.595 --> 17:56.814
we walked in the door.

17:56.901 --> 17:59.643
What a sad
and lonely existence.

17:59.730 --> 18:02.037
Only one pot..

18:02.124 --> 18:04.039
...and one working burner.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.347
Who could live like this?

18:09.740 --> 18:11.525
Well, at least
his last moments on Earth

18:11.612 --> 18:13.266
were spent with a woman
who really cared about him.

18:13.353 --> 18:15.616
That's true. A man's lucky
to find something like that.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.316
Yes, I am.
Grab his address book.

18:20.403 --> 18:22.318
Let's get out of here.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.277
Hey, so you think he died
while they were doing it

18:24.364 --> 18:26.235
or during the
sweet afterglow?

18:29.804 --> 18:31.675
Crossed that line again,
didn't I?

18:41.381 --> 18:44.688
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Is my mom alright?

18:44.775 --> 18:46.864
Yeah. I made her
a Xanax smoothie.

18:46.951 --> 18:49.389
She's upstairs sleeping
like a big, mean baby.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.827
Good.

18:52.914 --> 18:55.873
It's nice of you
to let her stay in our room.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.527
- "Our" room?
- Well, yeah.

18:57.614 --> 18:59.094
When I move in,
it's gonna be our room, right?

19:02.750 --> 19:05.274
Last time we talked, you didn't
seem too keen on the idea.

19:05.361 --> 19:08.147
Well, I've had some time to mull
it over and weigh the

19:08.234 --> 19:10.366
pros and cons, and I've decided
that I would

19:10.453 --> 19:12.368
rather live with the woman
I love than die

19:12.455 --> 19:14.762
sad and lonely, hunched
over a piece of lemon cake.

19:18.940 --> 19:21.203
Oh, Mike, Dennis
didn't die of..

19:21.290 --> 19:23.988
- Yes, he did, case closed.
- Okay, okay, okay, fine, fine.

19:29.994 --> 19:32.606
So, are you...ready
to move in here?

19:32.693 --> 19:34.608
Well, I'd better be,
I already called

19:34.695 --> 19:36.914
my landlord and gave notice
on the drive over here.

19:38.525 --> 19:39.656
Come here.

19:43.312 --> 19:46.185
- Hey, there's the new roomie.
- Evening, Mrs. Flynn.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.143
I heard your mama
rang a guy's bells

19:48.230 --> 19:49.362
all the way to heaven tonight.

19:57.848 --> 20:00.068
It's a house
full of women.. We talk.

20:06.988 --> 20:09.904
[theme music]
