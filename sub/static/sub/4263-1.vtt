- Mama's good, and Nicky's always healthy.

01:51:44.942 --> 01:51:47.911
You look wonderful.
Just wonderful.

01:51:47.979 --> 01:51:50.675
And we're happy to see you again...

01:51:50.748 --> 01:51:55.549
and let us all
cut our welcoming speeches short...

01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:57.815
because I'm very, very hungry...

01:51:57.889 --> 01:52:01.290
and I'm sure you must be hungry too.

01:52:01.359 --> 01:52:03.725
Okay, Adolph.
We're all going to eat.

01:52:03.795 --> 01:52:05.729
<i>[Woman] You look great.</i>
<i>You really look good.</i>

01:52:05.797 --> 01:52:08.960
- <i>[Grandma]</i>
<i>How do you do? I'm Mabel's mother.</i>
- You look good. God, you look sexy.

01:52:09.033 --> 01:52:12.025
- <i>And this is her father George.</i>
- <i>[Adolph] She looks wonderful.</i>

01:52:12.103 --> 01:52:14.333
- <i>She does look wonderful.</i>
- Oh.

01:52:14.405 --> 01:52:16.396
<i>[Adolph]</i>
<i>Very, very good.</i>

01:52:17.575 --> 01:52:20.237
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>And we'll go to lunch, or go to a movie, huh?</i>

01:52:20.311 --> 01:52:23.337
- <i>We'll go, right? Okay?</i>
- <i>[George] I could use a nice, hot cup of coffee.</i>

01:52:23.414 --> 01:52:25.348
<i>[Adolph]</i>
<i>And I'm sure that you are, like me...</i>

01:52:25.416 --> 01:52:27.714
- All right?
- <i>a man of breeds...</i>

01:52:27.785 --> 01:52:29.810
<i>that is hungry.</i>

01:52:29.887 --> 01:52:31.946
<i>[George]</i>
<i>Let's see if we can find a cup of coffee.</i>

01:52:32.023 --> 01:52:34.457
<i>[Grandma] Of course you're hungry.</i>
<i>We'll do something about that.</i>

01:52:34.525 --> 01:52:38.757
- <i>[Adolph] Thank you very much.</i>
- <i>I don't think the young people</i>
<i>think enough about how important food is.</i>

01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:41.298
- Could I see the children?
- <i>They go about eating like birds.</i>

01:52:41.365 --> 01:52:44.630
Why don't you wait a minute?
You go in there, they're gonna start to cry...

01:52:44.702 --> 01:52:47.694
and you're gonna start to cry,
and everybody's gonna get so emotional.

01:52:47.772 --> 01:52:51.264
- I think it's better. Sweetie.
- I've gotta see the children now.

01:52:51.342 --> 01:52:53.367
- Yes. You can see them.
- Where are they?

01:52:53.444 --> 01:52:56.277
They're in there.
Go ahead, dear. Go in.

01:52:57.782 --> 01:53:01.309
- <i>[Margaret]</i>
<i>Why shouldn't she see the children?</i>
- <i>[Grandma] You do think she looks good?</i>

- <i>I love you, Mama.</i>
- Okay. Enough now.

01:53:27.378 --> 01:53:29.312
I'm sorry.

01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:31.746
<i>Is everything okay, Mom?</i>

01:53:33.551 --> 01:53:35.542
Yes.

01:53:39.790 --> 01:53:42.588
It's just been such a long time.

01:53:50.201 --> 01:53:52.431
Oh, hello, banana.

01:53:54.772 --> 01:53:56.740
Hello, my little banana.
How are ya?

01:53:56.807 --> 01:53:58.832
<i>I missed you.</i>

01:53:58.910 --> 01:54:00.901
<i>Where's Maria?</i>

01:54:02.813 --> 01:54:04.838
Maria, come on over here
and see me.

01:54:04.916 --> 01:54:07.077
You want me to come over to you?

01:54:07.151 --> 01:54:10.518
- If you want to.
- You want me?

01:54:10.588 --> 01:54:12.954
If you want to.

01:54:13.024 --> 01:54:15.959
All right.
I'll just stay here then.

01:54:20.631 --> 01:54:22.622
<i>[Angelo]</i>
<i>Are you feeling better, Mom?</i>

01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:24.930
<i>Haven't got any more stomachaches?</i>

<i>I mean, haven't got any more headaches?</i>

01:54:28.572 --> 01:54:33.373
<i>No.</i> L... - <i>I'm just trying very hard</i>
<i>not to get excited.</i>

01:54:42.186 --> 01:54:44.416
Okay.

01:54:44.488 --> 01:54:48.219
No emotions now.
I really want to be calm.

01:54:48.292 --> 01:54:50.283
<i>[Angelo]</i>
<i>I really did miss...</i> -

01:54:52.763 --> 01:54:56.130
- That's enough now.
- <i>Are you tired or anything?</i>

01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:58.191
<i>You look great, Mom.</i>
<i>How are ya?</i>

01:54:58.269 --> 01:55:01.500
I'm gonna kiss your hand.
[Kissing]

01:55:01.572 --> 01:55:04.040
<i>How you...</i> -
<i>Did you miss us?</i>

01:55:04.175 --> 01:55:06.370
<i>[Door Opens, Closes]</i>

01:56:02.366 --> 01:56:04.493
- Oh, Doc.
- Oh. No, it's... -

01:56:04.568 --> 01:56:07.799
- Gee, I'm terribly sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

01:56:07.872 --> 01:56:10.807
No, I pulled the chair out,
and I thought you saw me.

01:56:13.778 --> 01:56:16.144
Look, hon.

01:56:16.213 --> 01:56:21.276
Everybody is having a good time here,
but I think we should leave you alone...

01:56:21.352 --> 01:56:23.343
so that you can relax.

01:56:26.190 --> 01:56:28.181
You're staying for dinner.

01:56:29.193 --> 01:56:31.661
I would stay for dinner...

01:56:31.729 --> 01:56:34.562
but, uh, uh, it's unbelievable.

01:56:34.632 --> 01:56:37.032
If you're gonna have spaghetti,
I can't stay.

01:56:37.101 --> 01:56:39.729
- George.
- I can't stay because I can't eat it.

01:56:39.804 --> 01:56:42.068
- Sit down!
- No offense. I just don't like spaghetti.

01:56:42.139 --> 01:56:44.107
- I'm not a spaghetti man.
- Sit down, George!

01:56:44.175 --> 01:56:46.735
- Don't you tell me to sit down!
- Dad.

01:56:48.813 --> 01:56:50.804
Hey.

01:56:54.552 --> 01:56:56.543
Come on.

01:56:59.457 --> 01:57:01.789
I'll sit down here with you, Dad.

01:57:01.859 --> 01:57:04.589
You can sit anywhere you like, hon.

01:57:10.401 --> 01:57:13.063
I'm very happy to see my family.

01:57:19.543 --> 01:57:21.568
Do I look pretty, Dad?

01:57:21.645 --> 01:57:23.670
You look beautiful, hon.

01:57:28.285 --> 01:57:31.015
- You think I'm gonna be all right?
- You're gonna be fine.

01:57:32.022 --> 01:57:34.013
Just fine.

01:58:05.156 --> 01:58:07.886
Mabel, honey.

01:58:07.958 --> 01:58:11.291
Why don't you go over
and sit with your mother?

01:58:11.362 --> 01:58:13.353
Go sit with your mother, hon.

01:58:29.847 --> 01:58:31.815
Come on. Excuse us for a minute.

01:58:31.882 --> 01:58:34.350
Come on. Don't worry.
It's all right.

- <i>I don't know what to do.</i>

- There's nothing you can do wrong.
- <i>I don't know what you want.</i>

01:58:47.398 --> 01:58:49.923
I just want you to be yourself.
This is your house.

Let's enjoy ourselves.

Let's have a little warmth here.

02:00:24.762 --> 02:00:26.696
Tina, you ready?
We're ready.

02:00:26.764 --> 02:00:28.698
Go on in, Doc. Come on.

02:00:28.766 --> 02:00:31.166

- I'll get this one, Dr. Zepp.
- Sure, sweetheart.

You're a good girl.

- Here's another chair.
- [Margaret] Adolph, you sit here.

There you are.

Thank you.

<i>[Maria]</i>
<i>Thank you, Tony.</i>

- All right.
- All right. Here we are.

02:01:31.795 --> 02:01:36.630
Tina, we're ready.
Stop acting like strangers. All right.

02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:39.430
So, what was it like up there? Terrible?

02:01:39.503 --> 02:01:41.494
Good? Bad? What?

Everybody's here.

02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:58.911
[Mabel]
Seems like a party.

02:02:02.292 --> 02:02:05.125
You should have seen it before.
We had 60 people here.

02:02:05.195 --> 02:02:08.562
- Nobody thought it was a good idea
to have a lot of people...
- That's right.

02:02:08.632 --> 02:02:10.998
But I thought it was a good idea.

02:02:11.068 --> 02:02:13.400
'Cause I think friends are a good idea.

02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:15.734
And good times are a good idea.

02:02:15.806 --> 02:02:17.740
- Right, Zepp?
- Right on.

02:02:17.808 --> 02:02:20.276
- Right, Adolph?
- Absolutely so.

02:02:20.344 --> 02:02:23.040
You see?

02:02:23.113 --> 02:02:26.173
I mean, uh, no sense
talking about the past.

02:02:26.250 --> 02:02:28.343
The past is the past.
That's dead.

02:02:28.419 --> 02:02:30.387
Forget about that.

02:02:30.454 --> 02:02:32.445
Good times from now on.
[Hits Table]

02:02:33.524 --> 02:02:35.458
That's what we're gonna have.

02:02:35.526 --> 02:02:37.756
Things are gonna get
better and better and better...

02:02:37.828 --> 02:02:40.797
and then they'll get better than that,
and then they'll get better.

02:02:40.864 --> 02:02:42.923
[Children]
Yea!

02:02:47.137 --> 02:02:49.503
Tony, did you see that?

02:02:49.573 --> 02:02:51.632
Did you see your mother wink at me?

02:02:56.980 --> 02:03:00.006
- Could I have a cup of tea?
- <i>[Margaret] Yes, dear.</i>

02:03:00.083 --> 02:03:03.382
<i>Tina's preparing some things</i>
<i>in the kitchen, if you'd like.</i>

02:03:03.454 --> 02:03:05.445
I'm gonna go in there a minute.

02:03:21.305 --> 02:03:23.296
[Tony Whispers]

02:03:25.242 --> 02:03:28.575
[Margaret]
Zepp, uh, do you think she's all right?

02:03:28.645 --> 02:03:32.103
- She's a little crazy in... -
- Oh, Mama.

02:03:32.182 --> 02:03:35.845
- The girl's fine.
- They gave her a release, you know. They gave... -

02:03:35.919 --> 02:03:38.979
- Ma, but did you see her wink at me?
- Yeah, I saw her.

02:03:39.056 --> 02:03:41.718
- But something in her eyes, you know.
- <i>[Mabel] Tina!</i>

02:03:41.792 --> 02:03:44.784
- Oh, no, don't. Don't.
- <i>[Mabel] You're so fat!</i>

02:03:44.862 --> 02:03:50.425
- <i>My God, girl!</i>
<i>You were 120 pounds when I left.</i>
- All right, Mama. That's enough.

02:03:50.501 --> 02:03:54.062
<i>You were...</i> - <i>What happ...</i> -
<i>How did you get so fat?</i>

02:03:54.137 --> 02:03:58.403
<i>Oh, Tina, you've gotta go to one of those places</i>
<i>and take some of that off.</i>

02:03:58.475 --> 02:04:02.036
<i>Look at your ass, Tina!</i>
<i>Oh, my God, Tina!</i>

02:04:02.112 --> 02:04:04.910
<i>That's fantastic! That's...</i> -
<i>Did they see...</i> -

02:04:04.982 --> 02:04:08.543
Did you see Tina's ass?
Nick, that ass is as... -

02:04:08.619 --> 02:04:11.486
I've never seen anything so... -
Oh. Tha... -

02:04:11.555 --> 02:04:16.390
Her ass is this big, Nick. And when
I went away it was... - it was this big.

02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:19.327
Did you see that ass?
Did you see it?

02:04:19.396 --> 02:04:22.126
You can hurt Tina's feelings
by talking about her ass.
