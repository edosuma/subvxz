Lucifer or Michael? I mean,
for you it's obvious, though, isn't it,

something rather special.

-Mmm.

01:35.637 --> 01:36.888
I'm not so sure.

01:37.597 --> 01:41.059
Well, it's true I haven't always
behaved in the most godly of ways,

01:41.142 --> 01:44.312
but let's be fair, I've also been
a victim of Michael's smear campaign

01:44.395 --> 01:45.522
for the last millennia.

01:45.605 --> 01:49.025
You saying you didn't, like,
lead a full-on rebellion against Dad?

I'm saying, I'm not that guy anymore.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.739
Being here on Earth has changed me.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.450

can I count on your support, bro?

Dude, what's the catch?

02:06.626 --> 02:09.712
-There's no catch.
-Come on, Luce, it's you.

02:09.796 --> 02:10.922
There's always a catch.

02:11.005 --> 02:14.217
The catch is
if I'm not God, then Michael will be.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.468
What could be worse than that?

02:15.552 --> 02:17.220
Michael's not that bad.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.722
Sure, he's got no chill,

02:19.806 --> 02:22.976
but he's been up in the Silver City
this whole time, at Dad's side.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.436
He's, like, practically already in charge.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.772
Exactly. Whispering in Dad's ear,

02:27.856 --> 02:30.608
making him think he was
losing his powers in the first place,

02:30.692 --> 02:32.152
all so he could take over now.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.488
Yeah, Michael's kind of a dick.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.073
He's a massive dick.

But he keeps the trains running, you know?

02:39.284 --> 02:40.994
He-- [groans]

02:41.077 --> 02:44.622
Are you seriously telling me
that Michael has got your vote

02:44.706 --> 02:47.250
because-- because he's the Devil you know?

02:47.333 --> 02:51.004
Do you have any idea
how ironically infuriating that is?

You're talking about the wine, aren't you?

Who's the victim?

06:16.250 --> 06:20.088

06:22.632 --> 06:25.718
Cause of death,
two gunshots to the chest, .45 caliber.

06:25.802 --> 06:26.969
What about the bruises?

06:27.053 --> 06:28.846
[Ella] Well,
it looks like he was tied down

06:28.930 --> 06:32.016
and forced to drink wine for
a couple of hours before he was shot.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.602
So you're saying he was water-Bordeaux-ed.

06:34.685 --> 06:38.064
-[chuckles] That's actually kind of funny.
-Oh! Ah!

06:38.147 --> 06:39.565

06:39.649 --> 06:42.110
-Yeah, this is his wine locker.
-[Lucifer] Don't be ridiculous.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.903

06:43.986 --> 06:46.739
could never afford
such an exquisite wine collection.

-Great point.
-Yes.

from a wine puddle over there.

I doubt there's enough
to match with anything.

06:57.250 --> 07:03.464
But we did get the victim's phone,
and a few days ago,

07:03.548 --> 07:07.135
he got a really mean text
from someone named Mo.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.222
"You screwed me. You're gonna pay."

07:11.305 --> 07:13.683

and see who the number belongs to.

08:39.852 --> 08:40.728
No.

what it's all about. [sighs]

11:00.076 --> 11:01.494
Maybe this is one of the real ones.

11:01.577 --> 11:02.828
[Odetta] Excuse me.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.038
Nothing.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.415
Now…

11:08.542 --> 11:09.960
Mmm!

11:10.044 --> 11:14.548
I can feel your great uncertainty
in this time of change.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.883
[gasps]

11:15.966 --> 11:19.970
You are worried about a health issue.

11:20.554 --> 11:21.555
[Lucifer] Um…

11:22.181 --> 11:27.603
That could potentially develop due
to all the stress you are having over a…

11:29.438 --> 11:31.440
professional opportunity?

11:31.524 --> 11:35.069
Yes, I'm up for a big promotion
in the family business.

11:35.152 --> 11:38.489
Right. Rig-- oh, I can see it clearly now.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.618
But there is strife within the family.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.204
Right. 'Cause all families are functional.

11:45.287 --> 11:49.834
And it seems you are not
the only one vying for the job.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.836
Amazing. Yes.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.838
-Mm-hmm.
-My no-good, manipulative bastard

11:53.921 --> 11:56.549
of a brother is trying to steal it out
from under me. [chuckles]

11:56.632 --> 11:58.592
In fact,
there are just a few swing votes left.

11:58.676 --> 12:02.555
Can you tell me how to convince
my siblings I'm the right man for the job?

12:02.638 --> 12:04.056
[Odetta sighs]

12:11.605 --> 12:12.690
[groans]

12:12.773 --> 12:15.776
You must lean into your strengths.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.988
Lean into my strengths, that's genius!
[snaps fingers]

12:19.071 --> 12:20.823
[laughs] I'm sorry.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.283
[clears throat] Go ahead.

12:22.366 --> 12:23.784
[Odetta] Hmm.

12:24.910 --> 12:28.831
I am sensing
you are the skeptic in the relationship.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.875
How is she even doing this? [chuckles]

12:30.958 --> 12:33.419
So, why are you here?

12:33.502 --> 12:36.130
We are here about Jonathan Donnelly.

12:37.715 --> 12:38.549
Who is that?

12:38.632 --> 12:41.177
He's the guy that you've
been sending threatening texts to,

12:41.260 --> 12:43.262
and don't bother denying it.

12:43.929 --> 12:48.267
Your phone records show
repeated calls and texts to and from him.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.898
Oh. That Jonathan, yes.

12:53.981 --> 12:57.485
Yes, I didn't know you meant him.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.570
I have read for him in the past.

12:59.653 --> 13:02.114
If you're a real psychic,
surely you would've known that.

13:02.198 --> 13:05.117
Actually,
my specialty is channeling the dead,

13:05.201 --> 13:07.161
and since Jonathan is very much alive--

13:07.244 --> 13:09.663
-Actually, Jonathan is very much dead.
-[Lucifer] Hmm.

13:09.747 --> 13:12.541
Tortured and shot in his wine locker

13:12.625 --> 13:15.836
shortly after receiving
your threatening text.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.631
Hang on, Jonathan is dead?

13:19.548 --> 13:22.635
-And you think I did it?
-How did you not see that coming?

13:22.718 --> 13:24.970
Because she's not a psychic.
She's a con artist.

13:25.054 --> 13:28.933
You advertise that you can locate
lost items from dead relatives,

13:29.016 --> 13:31.644
and you know who'd be
the perfect accomplice in that scam?

13:31.727 --> 13:33.395
A tech from the ME's office,

13:33.479 --> 13:36.106
who has access
to bodies and their valuables.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.235
That is absurd. I would never.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.612
One call to a judge,
I subpoena your records.

13:41.695 --> 13:44.782
I get proof,
and you go down for fraud and murder.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.243
Hang on now.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.704
I didn't kill anybody. Okay?

13:50.788 --> 13:52.748
Why would I kill Jonathan?

13:53.374 --> 13:54.667
Our hustle was genius.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.627
He would steal a valuable off a body,

13:56.710 --> 14:01.757
plant it somewhere and then use targeted
online ads to direct the family to use me.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.260
Mm-hmm. And then you'd magically
find the family heirloom.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.511
Yep.

14:05.594 --> 14:09.098
You may not be a real medium,
but that is an excellent scam. Respect.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.224
Oh, thank you.

14:10.307 --> 14:11.809
You're very welcome.

14:11.892 --> 14:17.231
But you see why I would be
a total idiot to stop that money train.

14:17.314 --> 14:19.733
-Right?
-Where were you last night at 8:00 p.m.?

14:21.402 --> 14:22.403
Giving a reading…

14:23.153 --> 14:25.781
to a programming exec

14:26.699 --> 14:27.575
at Fox.

14:27.658 --> 14:28.868
Oh, good luck with that.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.287
So, just say that story checks out,

14:31.370 --> 14:34.498
do you know of anyone else
who would wanna hurt Jonathan?

14:34.582 --> 14:38.002
Maybe one of the other families
found out that their stuff was being sold?

14:38.085 --> 14:39.587
What do you mean "other families"?

14:39.670 --> 14:41.755
The ones that didn't bite.

14:42.548 --> 14:46.927
Jonathan would give whatever he took from
their dead relative to a fence named TJ,

14:47.011 --> 14:50.264
and then TJ would sell it
on the black market.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.225
Great. What's TJ's last name?

14:53.309 --> 14:56.395
I don't know.
But I know that he works out of Hollywood.

14:56.478 --> 14:57.313
Helpful.

15:01.025 --> 15:01.859
[Dan] Boom!

15:02.985 --> 15:07.364
Rainbow Lasso, which means I get to
take Mr. Narwhal and put him in my stable.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.742
No, Dad, you can only throw Rainbow Lasso

15:09.825 --> 15:11.827
if she's in your hand
at the beginning of your turn.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.412
Oh, come on.

15:13.495 --> 15:15.497
You know what? These rules are confusing.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.917
Or maybe I'm just better
at building unicorn armies.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.252
-[scoffs] Yeah, right.
-I win.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.170
What?

15:22.463 --> 15:24.840
Come on! Again?

15:24.924 --> 15:27.384
-Want another shot at the unicorn title?
-[scoffs] Yeah.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.346
But I go first because
I'm wearing the most colorful clothes.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.889
[sighs]

15:33.515 --> 15:34.558
Okay, fine.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.645
I'll lend you my glitter scarf,
and then you can go first.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.854
But you have to wear it.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.147
[chuckles] I promise.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.274
Okay. And I have to go find it.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.276
[Dan] Cool. I'll clean up our mess.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.531
[knock on door]

15:49.615 --> 15:51.784
[hums]

15:52.451 --> 15:53.369
Hey, what's up, man?

15:53.452 --> 15:56.038
Hey, hey, hey, hey. [chuckles]

15:56.121 --> 15:58.082
-Dan, I figured it out.
-What's that?

15:58.165 --> 16:01.293
Uh, what I'm gonna do here
now that I've decided to stay.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.545
-Oh, okay.
-[sighs]

16:05.047 --> 16:09.468
-I'm gonna become a policeman.
-[both laugh]

16:09.551 --> 16:11.095
I mean, I really like helping people,

16:11.178 --> 16:14.223
and what better way to do that
than putting away criminals?

16:14.306 --> 16:16.266
[both laugh]

16:16.350 --> 16:18.060
You wanna be a cop?

16:18.143 --> 16:20.896
Won't it be great?
I mean, we can even work together one day.

16:20.980 --> 16:25.442
Oh, yeah, yeah, an angel and a detective
solving crimes, makes total sense.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.611
[laughs, stops]

16:28.612 --> 16:31.240
-[clears throat]
-You don't think it's a good idea.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.324
No, it's just that--

16:34.660 --> 16:36.829
Bro, you're a freaking angel.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.248
-[sighs]
-You were almost God.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.419
I mean, there's gotta be something
that better suits your skill set.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.506
So you think it's a bad idea
because I wouldn't be any good at it.

16:47.589 --> 16:49.675
No, that's not what I said.
It's just that…

16:51.385 --> 16:53.178
there are different kinds of people.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.347
Different kinds of jobs.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.807
[scoffs]

16:56.890 --> 16:58.934
You know something? Of all people,

16:59.685 --> 17:02.604
I really thought you'd be the one
that would be most excited for me.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.567
-Amenadiel.
-[door opens]

17:06.650 --> 17:08.861
Okay, that-- that's not what I mea--

17:08.944 --> 17:10.070
[door closes]

17:10.946 --> 17:12.531
It's not what I meant.

17:14.658 --> 17:16.994
[Saraqael] Why bother, Lucifer?
You're not getting my vote.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.038
Yeah, I supported you once
in the rebellion,

17:19.121 --> 17:21.498
but then I had to suffer
Dad's passive-aggressive wrath.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.251
And try climbing out
of that proverbial doghouse.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.671
And it certainly doesn't
help your case that even Jophiel,

17:27.755 --> 17:30.382
who, let's face it, is an idiot,

17:30.466 --> 17:32.176
even he thinks your pitch is lacking.

17:32.259 --> 17:35.554
-Truth is I'm only here as a courtesy.
-[both chuckle]

17:36.638 --> 17:38.557
Saraqael. Sara.

17:39.933 --> 17:42.728
What is it you truly desire?

17:45.272 --> 17:48.567
You seriously think I'm going to fall
for your silly little parlor trick?

17:48.650 --> 17:51.904
[chuckles] A not-so-wise woman recently
suggested I lean into my strengths.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.989
Too bad she didn't
teach you how to cut your losses.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.909
I learned I needed to ask
not what the angels can do for you,

17:56.992 --> 17:59.453
but what can you do for the angels?

17:59.536 --> 18:01.330
I have no idea what that means.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.915
It means you're right.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.959
I shouldn't try and convince you
I'd be a better God than Michael.

18:06.043 --> 18:09.129
What I should do is
the one thing I can do better than anyone

18:09.213 --> 18:11.048
and that is grant favors.

18:11.131 --> 18:13.884
So, again, I humbly ask you,

18:14.718 --> 18:16.095
what is it you desire?

18:16.178 --> 18:19.932
[scoffs] I'm an angel, Lucifer,
I'm totally above the base passions

18:20.015 --> 18:22.142
and petty desires
that humans fall prey to.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.394
Oh, my God,

18:24.478 --> 18:25.979
is that Michael Voltaggio?

18:26.063 --> 18:28.273
You mean
Top Chef champion Michael Voltaggio?

18:28.357 --> 18:30.692
-Why, yes, it is.
-[laughing]

18:30.776 --> 18:32.694
-Hello, Michael.
-You're Lucifer's sister, right?

18:32.778 --> 18:34.488
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.573
Michael, is that really you in the flesh?

18:36.657 --> 18:38.492
I mean, you--
I just-- I can't, I just, I--

18:39.118 --> 18:40.160
You! [laughs]

18:40.244 --> 18:42.788
Your egg yolk gnocchi is divine,

18:42.871 --> 18:45.582
and I should know, because I am an angel.

18:45.666 --> 18:49.086
But you, you are such a bad boy,

18:49.169 --> 18:51.964
and I am feeling hungry. [cackles]

18:52.047 --> 18:55.217
[laughs] Anyway, Michael, would you
excuse us for just a moment?

18:55.300 --> 18:57.553
-Sure, I'll just be over at the bar.
-[Saraqael] Okay.

18:57.636 --> 19:03.559
So, I have arranged for you
to have the full Volt VIP experience.

19:03.642 --> 19:08.438
A Friday night reservation for life
at Estuary, his new restaurant in DC,

19:08.522 --> 19:12.317
Michael's special recipe
for rice pilaf, and…

19:14.862 --> 19:17.364
-…his personal phone number.
-[gasps]

19:17.447 --> 19:21.660
In exchange,
all I ask is for your support.

19:22.744 --> 19:25.664
Wow, I mean,
I gotta hand it to you, Lucifer.

19:25.747 --> 19:28.083
It's gonna be
really hard to say no after that.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.543
Excellent. [chuckles]

19:29.626 --> 19:31.253
Amazing, thank you.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.922
[sighs] Well,
truth be told, Michael owes me.

19:34.006 --> 19:37.509
How else do you think he won Top Chef?
That squab was inedible.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.220
But still, I mean,
this is a really big favor to ask.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.432
-Mmm.
-[gasps] You must really wanna be God.

19:44.766 --> 19:47.936
Actually, why do you want it so badly?

19:50.314 --> 19:54.151
Um, well, you know,

19:54.234 --> 19:57.613
because who-- who wouldn't want it?

19:58.989 --> 20:00.741
[chuckles] Right.

20:00.824 --> 20:05.078
[inhales] You know what? I actually
need to think about this a little more.

20:05.162 --> 20:08.332
-Saraqael, I--
-I should go. [chuckles]

[Lucifer] Well, at least it's not boring.
Unlike this, our final case.

-I wonder if they found it.
-[man] Found what?

21:59.818 --> 22:00.819
[Chloe] TJ Ross?

22:01.820 --> 22:02.904
Who wants to know?

22:03.488 --> 22:07.075
Detective Decker, LAPD. We're here to talk
about the death of Jonathan Donnelly.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.911
Stay away. I-- I don't wanna hurt you.

22:09.995 --> 22:13.040
You? Hurt us? Adorable. [chuckles]

22:13.123 --> 22:14.624
Come along now, TJ.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.960
[TJ grunts]

22:20.380 --> 22:21.381
[exclaims]

22:24.384 --> 22:26.011
[groans]

22:26.094 --> 22:28.263
[panting]

22:28.347 --> 22:29.723
What was that?

22:31.433 --> 22:34.770
[Ella] Size 13. Taken from the rubble
at TJ Ross' house.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.271
Bigger than any of his shoes,

22:36.355 --> 22:39.107
but it does match the shoe print
we found at the wine locker.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.694
So whoever killed Jonathan Donnelly
also ransacked TJ's place?

22:42.778 --> 22:45.697
They had to be looking for something
Jonathan stole off a corpse.

22:45.781 --> 22:48.450
Given what was left behind,
I'd say they haven't found it yet.

22:48.533 --> 22:51.119
But what is this object?

22:51.203 --> 22:53.663
Who wants it? And why?

22:54.331 --> 22:59.252
And where does our killer
buy his enormous boots?

22:59.336 --> 23:01.380
It's all a mystery, isn't it?

23:01.463 --> 23:07.344
A thrilling, tangled web
of discovery and contradiction

23:07.427 --> 23:11.431
that you two are never gonna see because
you're running off to stupid Alabama!

23:12.307 --> 23:15.644
She thinks we're going north of Florida.
We're definitely not going there.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.021
-Alabama's actually really nice.
-You would think that.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.524
Okay, everybody.
Let's focus on the killer.

23:20.607 --> 23:23.193
Our priority now is TJ Ross.

23:23.276 --> 23:24.277
We find him,

23:24.361 --> 23:26.947
we find what the killer wants,
that might lead us to him.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.491
So Lucifer and I will focus
on his friends and family.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.743
And there are TJ's usual clients.

23:31.827 --> 23:35.080
Yeah, but the client list we found
on TJ's computer runs in the hundreds.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.374
I foresee great boredom in my future.

23:37.457 --> 23:40.293
You know what?
Why don't I get started on that list?

23:41.378 --> 23:43.338
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I mean, it's your last case.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.382
Least I can do is
help with the grunt work.

23:45.465 --> 23:47.592
-Thank you, Daniel. Take one for the team.
-I got it.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.010
-Hey, you.
-[Ella] Yeah.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.929
You forgot this.

23:51.012 --> 23:53.223
-What's that?
-It's my friend Carol's phone number.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.892
-Dan, no!
-Come on, please.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.395
You've gotta call him, please.
Please, for me.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.022
Mi hermanita, por favor.

24:02.649 --> 24:05.193
Yes! You won't regret it, I promise.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.113
-Mm-hmm. He better be cute!
-[Dan] He's beautiful.

24:10.532 --> 24:13.785
We still have to figure out what was
going on with that superhuman kick.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.745
Are we dealing with someone celestial?

24:15.829 --> 24:18.540
I don't know,
but I have a theory. I can check it out.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.041
[sighs] Okay.

24:20.625 --> 24:24.796
You go find out what TJ is,
and I'll track down where he is.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.214
-Right.
-Okay.

24:31.595 --> 24:32.637
[Mazikeen] Oh.

24:34.931 --> 24:35.974
What do you think?

24:37.100 --> 24:38.268
Mask?

24:38.935 --> 24:39.769
No mask?

24:39.853 --> 24:41.146
Maybe…

24:42.355 --> 24:43.523
no mask?

24:43.607 --> 24:44.649
Yeah.

24:44.733 --> 24:48.028
You're right.
Nothing says wrath like my demon face.

24:48.111 --> 24:52.657
[exhales] But I still feel like I need
something that says, you know…

24:53.700 --> 24:57.996
"I've returned to fiercely
rule over you for all of eternity."

24:59.122 --> 25:02.792
But like, not in a needy way.
Think murderously aspirational.

25:02.876 --> 25:03.835
Well, I…

25:05.295 --> 25:06.463
I like the blue one.

25:06.546 --> 25:07.797
Yeah, you're not helping, Linda.

25:07.881 --> 25:11.510
Okay, is it possible that
you're fixating on this outfit because

25:11.593 --> 25:13.553
you're really worried
about something else?

25:15.263 --> 25:18.683
Well, I am worried that Lucifer won't pull
his head out of his ass and become God.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.852
No, I was actually thinking
that you might be concerned

25:20.936 --> 25:23.730
about becoming the Queen of Hell.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.733
What would worry me about that?

25:27.317 --> 25:29.986
Well, maybe that you have a soul now.

25:30.612 --> 25:35.492
And you might be worried that that soul
might hinder the joy you once felt

25:35.575 --> 25:36.826
by torturing others.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.245
Yeah.

25:39.287 --> 25:41.957
The whole soul thing, it isn't for me.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.835
I'm the one who grew it, so I'm just
gonna let it slowly suffocate and die.

25:46.419 --> 25:47.546
Like I did with Chad.

25:47.629 --> 25:48.755
Who's Chad?

25:49.339 --> 25:50.298
Doesn't matter.

25:51.216 --> 25:54.010
Okay, so, um, Maze, listen.

25:55.053 --> 26:00.141
You grew a soul through the relationships
that you nurtured here on Earth.

26:00.809 --> 26:05.105
Through the moments that you shared
with people who care about you.

26:05.188 --> 26:06.356
Like me.

26:06.439 --> 26:08.942
Are you really sure that you wanna just

26:09.025 --> 26:12.904
suffocate
the wonderful times we've shared?

26:12.988 --> 26:14.406
Oh, Linda.

26:16.366 --> 26:17.951
I know what you're doing.

26:18.702 --> 26:21.955
You don't want me to go so you're
covertly trying to get into my head.

26:22.038 --> 26:26.126
No, I'm overtly trying to get
in your head. You don't have to do this.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.752
Yes, I do.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.965
-[door opens]
-The alternative is much worse.

26:32.048 --> 26:35.760
Oh, there you are.
What are you wearing?

26:35.844 --> 26:37.679
You look a bony xylophone.

26:37.762 --> 26:40.265
Uh, Doctor,
would you excuse us just a moment?

26:40.348 --> 26:42.309
I thought you'd never ask.

26:42.392 --> 26:43.643
[Mazikeen sighs]

26:46.354 --> 26:48.773
Have you heard of
any demons roaming the Earth lately?

26:48.857 --> 26:50.066
Why?

26:50.150 --> 26:52.652
There appears to be
a human with super strength

26:52.736 --> 26:55.697
and a hurdling technique to match,
running around Hollywood.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.490
I haven't heard of any.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.200
But you never know.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.411
The throne of Hell is empty, after all.

27:01.494 --> 27:04.205
If you are concerned,
there is any easy way

27:04.289 --> 27:06.916
for you to get the Underworld in check.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.337
Yes, yes, get elected God
so I can make you Queen, I get it.

27:10.420 --> 27:14.174
Just keep an eye out for rogue demons
and don't worry about the election.

27:14.758 --> 27:15.884
I have it handled.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.260
[Mazikeen] Do you?

27:17.344 --> 27:21.139
Zadkiel is your last swing vote,
and he hates you.

27:21.222 --> 27:22.599
Yes, he does.

27:22.682 --> 27:23.850
But I have a plan.

27:24.934 --> 27:29.898
I'm going to tell him something
I've never told anyone before.

27:31.441 --> 27:32.317
What's that?

27:32.400 --> 27:33.652
I was wrong.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.114
I know, it's a miracle.

27:38.698 --> 27:43.870
But as much as it pains me to say,
my rebellion was ill-conceived.

27:43.953 --> 27:47.332
Why? Because
I did it for the wrong reasons.

27:47.415 --> 27:50.126
I rebelled out of anger at Father,

27:50.210 --> 27:52.796
out of a desire to prove
that I was better than him,

27:52.879 --> 27:55.048
but I've changed.

27:55.715 --> 27:59.427
I've spent my time on Earth
growing, getting over my…

28:00.220 --> 28:02.222
[chuckles] …my Daddy issues.

28:03.181 --> 28:08.269
I know how monumental his job
actually was and is now.

28:09.270 --> 28:12.899
Those are big shoes to fill,
but I promise you, Zadkiel,

28:12.982 --> 28:16.277
I will give it my absolute best.

28:17.737 --> 28:18.571
Lucifer.

28:19.823 --> 28:20.657
Wow!

28:21.658 --> 28:22.909
That was well spoken.

28:23.660 --> 28:24.869
Emotionally evolved.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.371
Well… [chuckles]

28:26.454 --> 28:27.414
Impressive.

28:28.665 --> 28:32.127
Impressive enough to possibly
win over the Angel of Righteousness?

28:32.210 --> 28:33.420
I mean, no.

28:33.503 --> 28:34.838
It's always gonna be a no.

28:35.422 --> 28:38.466
[chuckles] You don't wanna meet
Michael Voltaggio, do you?

28:40.510 --> 28:44.180
I'm just here for the whiskey.
Jophiel said you bribed with top shelf.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.807
[laughs]

28:45.890 --> 28:47.434
And to watch you grovel.

28:50.061 --> 28:52.147
Of course it was
never gonna work, was it?

28:53.857 --> 28:58.987
All that nonsense about making peace
with Father and growing as an angel.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.405
[chuckles]

29:00.488 --> 29:04.826
Mm. You know,
the crazy thing is, it's all true, but…

29:05.577 --> 29:07.370
[sighs] …it's not the whole truth.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.461
You really wanna know
why I'm doing all of this?

29:14.544 --> 29:16.671
Why I'm trying to become God?

29:18.089 --> 29:21.634
I'm doing it for love. [laughing]

29:21.718 --> 29:23.678
And it gets worse.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.431
I'm doing it for the love of a human.

29:27.348 --> 29:33.813
I am trying to be God
so that I can finally be worthy of her.

29:33.897 --> 29:37.025
So there you have it, enjoy the top shelf.

29:38.777 --> 29:39.903
[Zadkiel] This woman…

29:41.070 --> 29:42.906
is she the gift Father made for you?

29:42.989 --> 29:48.536
Her name is Chloe Decker,
and she is much more than that!

29:49.913 --> 29:51.122
So yes,

29:51.206 --> 29:54.000
I am doing this
for the wrong reasons again,

29:54.083 --> 29:56.002
but do you know what? I don't care.

29:56.085 --> 29:58.046
All I care about is her.

29:58.129 --> 30:02.509
Which is why
I have to make this happen, and I will.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.260
No matter what the costs.

30:04.344 --> 30:07.013
With or without your vote.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.318
[knocks]

30:25.657 --> 30:26.616
Brooke Frier?

30:26.699 --> 30:27.867
I'm Mrs. Frier.

30:28.409 --> 30:31.704
Oh, I'm Detective Espinoza, with the LAPD.

30:32.789 --> 30:35.083
Listen, we know that
you were a client of TJ Ross.

30:36.292 --> 30:38.670
I'm not here
to trip you up about that, Mrs. Frier.

30:38.753 --> 30:41.714
We have information
regarding a possible threat.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.926
Somebody's after
one of TJ's stolen items,

30:45.009 --> 30:47.887
and they've already killed somebody
trying to get it.

30:49.305 --> 30:50.557
That's horrible.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.100
Yeah. Yes, ma'am, it is,

30:52.183 --> 30:55.520
and if I can find you,
well, then the killer can find you.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.774
So I'm wondering if you've noticed
anything out of the ordinary?

31:00.275 --> 31:03.528
You know, any strangers
lurking around or anything like that.

31:05.446 --> 31:07.866
No, I haven't.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.870
And if that's all, I should go.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.371
Got a roast in the oven.

31:15.081 --> 31:15.915
Sure.

31:16.499 --> 31:18.459
Yeah, absolutely, thank you for your time.

31:18.543 --> 31:19.669
You have a wonderful day.

31:19.752 --> 31:20.837
Thank you.

31:35.935 --> 31:37.854
[dialing]

31:37.937 --> 31:39.981
[rings]

31:40.064 --> 31:40.899
Hey.

31:41.941 --> 31:42.775
Espinoza.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.361
A possible home invasion.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.780
Layton Street, Hancock Park.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.407
Request immediate backup.

31:49.490 --> 31:51.576
-[gun cocks]
-Hang up the phone.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.045
[Ella] Two gunshots
to the chest, .45 caliber.

32:02.128 --> 32:04.505
Same MO as Jonathan Donnelly.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.507
I'd say it's definitely the same killer.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.843
-[Lucifer sighs]
-[Chloe] Thanks.

32:10.637 --> 32:12.680
Were they able to ping Dan's phone?

32:13.514 --> 32:15.391
No. They must have turned it off.

32:16.225 --> 32:19.228
I can't believe he came here alone.
I should have gone with him.

32:19.312 --> 32:22.440
No, no, no, Ella, we can't go there.
Not yet, you know.

32:22.523 --> 32:23.733
This house was ransacked too,

32:23.816 --> 32:26.152
so maybe the killer
didn't find what they were looking for.

32:26.235 --> 32:28.488
Which means they would
have incentive to keep Dan alive.

32:28.571 --> 32:29.906
-Right. Right.
-Right.

32:29.989 --> 32:32.158
So let's just do our job
and let's find him.

32:32.241 --> 32:33.076
Okay.

32:33.159 --> 32:34.452
Look at those flowers.

32:36.162 --> 32:37.956
Looks like there was a scuffle.

32:40.249 --> 32:41.584
He must have fought back.

32:42.543 --> 32:43.419
[Ella] Guys.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.172
He doesn't even have his phone.

32:47.048 --> 32:47.882
This is bad.

32:47.966 --> 32:52.136
No, no, this is Daniel.
He's-- he's more than capable.

32:52.971 --> 32:53.805
You're right.

32:55.431 --> 32:56.516
Hey, hey.

32:57.558 --> 32:59.394
I think there's something there, too.

33:01.396 --> 33:02.355
Yeah.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.274
Definitely seems like
there was some kind of fight.

33:06.567 --> 33:07.402
Hey, you guys.

33:08.027 --> 33:09.737
It looks like
there's something down there.

33:09.862 --> 33:10.738
[Chloe gasps]

33:18.287 --> 33:19.288
[exhales]

33:20.415 --> 33:21.791
He left us a clue.

33:24.168 --> 33:26.212
Dog tags.
French Foreign Legion, to be exact.

33:26.295 --> 33:28.089
Been using the same one since the '40s.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.590
-Got a name?
-[Ella] Yep.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.260
Sayeed Faisal. Algerian.

33:32.343 --> 33:33.678
Dishonorably discharged.

33:33.761 --> 33:36.973
He's been linked to a ruthless
mercenary group led by this guy,

33:37.056 --> 33:37.890
Vincent Le Mec.

33:37.974 --> 33:41.394
We got running guns, kidnapping, murder,

33:41.477 --> 33:45.940

No. You said it yourself.
We can't go there.

Michael's still in the Silver City.

use a lowly jewelry fence?

48:40.626 --> 48:42.294
If that's the case, Lucifer…

48:44.004 --> 48:47.007
then your brothers
and your sisters are right.

48:47.090 --> 48:48.425
You shouldn't be God.

49:48.777 --> 49:52.906
Excuse me, um, Ella? Are you Ella Lopez?

49:52.990 --> 49:53.824
Yeah.

49:55.450 --> 49:56.410
Hi, I'm…

49:57.244 --> 49:58.537
I'm Carol Corbett.

49:58.620 --> 49:59.663
As in--

49:59.746 --> 50:04.292
The guy that
Dan was trying to set me up with. Right.

50:04.376 --> 50:07.504
Yeah, yeah, um… [chuckles]

50:10.632 --> 50:13.635
Look, I'm sorry to even… [exhales]

50:15.220 --> 50:16.221
You know, I just…

50:19.307 --> 50:21.852
Dan was always
just looking out for me, you know?

50:22.436 --> 50:23.353
Yeah.

50:24.646 --> 50:25.522
Me, too.

50:27.399 --> 50:29.526
I think he was always
looking out for everyone.

50:29.609 --> 50:31.778
Yeah, yeah, he was. [chuckles]

50:34.364 --> 50:37.826
Uh, speaking of which,
there's a friend I need to talk to.

50:38.827 --> 50:41.747
Of course, yeah. [sighs]

50:45.292 --> 50:48.253
Hey, save me a seat, will you?

50:49.463 --> 50:50.881
For sure. I will.

51:04.728 --> 51:05.854
I know.

51:06.897 --> 51:08.607
I can't believe he's gone.

51:09.608 --> 51:10.817
Last time I saw him…

51:12.611 --> 51:15.864
I said some things
that I can never take back.

51:16.573 --> 51:18.617
I know. He told me.

51:20.035 --> 51:20.869
He did?

51:20.952 --> 51:22.329
Mm-hmm.

51:22.412 --> 51:23.413
Yeah.

51:23.497 --> 51:26.249
I was considering becoming a cop and…

51:27.626 --> 51:30.253
I don't think
Dan thought it was a good idea.

51:30.837 --> 51:32.297
[chuckles]

51:32.380 --> 51:34.382
That's where you're wrong, Amenadiel.

51:35.759 --> 51:37.886
That's what I came over here to tell you.

51:38.720 --> 51:40.013
Day he died…

51:41.139 --> 51:44.267
he turned in your application
to the Police Academy.

51:47.395 --> 51:49.356
[both sigh]

51:52.192 --> 51:54.945
At least we both know
he's in a better place now, right?

51:57.280 --> 51:58.115
Yeah.

52:19.302 --> 52:21.221
There's something I have to tell you.

52:22.139 --> 52:23.849
I went to see Dan in Heaven.

52:23.932 --> 52:25.016
Oh.

52:25.100 --> 52:28.395
Let me guess.
Swimming in a vat of chocolate pudding.

52:29.604 --> 52:31.356
He's not there, Lucy.

52:32.232 --> 52:33.066
What?

52:33.150 --> 52:34.192
He's not there.

52:34.276 --> 52:35.694
Dan isn't in Heaven.

52:37.654 --> 52:38.530
I just…

52:39.114 --> 52:40.157
I went to check and…

52:40.240 --> 52:42.617
But that would mean…

52:45.412 --> 52:46.246
No.

52:47.038 --> 52:49.207
No, Daniel dealt with his guilt.

52:49.291 --> 52:50.333
He told me as much.

52:50.417 --> 52:53.253
Lucy, you and I both know that guilt is

52:53.336 --> 52:56.464
much more complicated
and deep-seated than we're even aware of.

52:57.090 --> 52:58.008
That isn't--

52:58.758 --> 53:01.136
[huffs] It's not fair.

53:01.219 --> 53:02.637
None of this is.

53:20.071 --> 53:23.241
When I first arrived
in Los Angeles, I was angry.

53:24.784 --> 53:25.994
[chuckles]

53:27.871 --> 53:31.416
I was angry and confused
about my place in the world.

53:31.499 --> 53:33.627
I didn't know how to connect with people.

53:34.920 --> 53:35.754
But Dan…

53:38.006 --> 53:39.007
Dan did.

53:40.300 --> 53:44.054
And he taught me how to be a good friend.

53:44.804 --> 53:46.514
How to be a good father.

53:48.433 --> 53:49.601
He taught me…

53:53.104 --> 53:54.356
how to be a good man.

53:55.273 --> 53:56.733
Because he was a good man.

53:57.901 --> 54:00.362
The sad thing is
I think he forgot that sometimes,

54:00.445 --> 54:03.281
but he was a good, good man.

54:03.365 --> 54:06.201
Always trying to do right by others.

54:06.284 --> 54:08.370
Always trying to do better.

54:10.664 --> 54:13.416
Even though he was already
the very best of us.

54:17.420 --> 54:18.755
What happened to Dan…

54:21.508 --> 54:22.550
it isn't fair.

54:25.095 --> 54:27.889
And you have every right
to feel angry about it.

54:29.557 --> 54:30.392
But…

54:32.852 --> 54:34.980
you can take comfort in knowing that…

54:41.027 --> 54:43.238
that Dan is in a much better place.

54:48.535 --> 54:49.369
Dan…

54:51.329 --> 54:52.706
you are, and you…

54:54.249 --> 54:56.626
always will be my best friend.

55:04.801 --> 55:06.928
I'm gonna miss you, buddy. [sobs]

55:08.763 --> 55:10.724
I'm really gonna miss you. We all will.

55:10.807 --> 55:13.184
[sobbing]

55:14.019 --> 55:15.145
And, uh…

55:17.439 --> 55:18.773
[sniffles]

55:18.857 --> 55:23.570
…I promise you that whatever happens,
from this day forward,

55:23.653 --> 55:27.615
I will always try and do better.

55:33.663 --> 55:35.665
[sniffles]

55:43.423 --> 55:44.591
[Lucifer sighs]

55:55.143 --> 55:56.269
I found them.

We found the people who killed Daniel.

59:13.716 --> 59:14.759
We made them pay.

59:19.138 --> 59:20.056
Okay.

59:20.640 --> 59:22.475
And how did that make you feel?

59:22.559 --> 59:23.518
[huffs]

59:24.435 --> 59:27.564
That's irrelevant.
My feelings don't matter.

59:27.647 --> 59:28.606
Yes, they do.

59:29.524 --> 59:30.608
You're grieving.

59:31.985 --> 59:34.028
It's important to acknowledge that.

59:34.112 --> 59:35.446
[chuckles]

59:36.698 --> 59:40.451
Such astute insight
from the doctor, once again.

59:42.078 --> 59:44.622
You know,
you are very good at what you do.

59:46.499 --> 59:49.460
But your job should simply not exist.

59:50.837 --> 59:54.591
You don't think helping people
cope with pain is important?

59:54.674 --> 59:56.759
I don't think pain should exist.

59:59.887 --> 1:00:00.722
I see.

1:00:02.432 --> 1:00:05.727
But that's life, Lucifer.

1:00:07.979 --> 1:00:10.982
Pain is inevitable.

1:00:12.900 --> 1:00:15.987
The suffering, that's optional.

1:00:16.070 --> 1:00:20.950
[shouts] Do not counsel me
on suffering and inevitability!

1:00:22.452 --> 1:00:26.289
There are no words to convince me
that the system isn't broken.

1:00:27.999 --> 1:00:29.834
Trixie shouldn't have to suffer the pain

1:00:29.917 --> 1:00:32.045
of seeing her father
ripped from her like that,

1:00:32.128 --> 1:00:34.380
and-- and Daniel shouldn't be de--

1:00:37.634 --> 1:00:40.345
Dan should not be dead.

1:00:42.639 --> 1:00:45.391
The system is not only broken.
It's unjust.

1:00:46.768 --> 1:00:47.602
Lucifer.

1:00:48.519 --> 1:00:52.190
You can't control all the bad things
that happen in this world.

1:00:53.816 --> 1:00:55.902
Only how they affect you.

1:00:55.985 --> 1:00:57.487
That's where you're wrong.

1:01:00.073 --> 1:01:01.949
See, there is something I can do.

1:01:02.784 --> 1:01:07.372
Before, I wanted to be God
for the wrong reasons, but now,

1:01:07.455 --> 1:01:12.919
I no longer want to be God.
I have to be God.

1:01:14.420 --> 1:01:16.172
Lucifer, what does that mean?

1:01:17.048 --> 1:01:18.174
It means…

1:01:18.883 --> 1:01:21.302
[gasps] …that we are going to war.
