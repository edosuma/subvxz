02:20.875 --> 02:23.431
So how many kids do you want?

02:23.511 --> 02:26.901
I don't know. What's the statistical norm?

02:26.981 --> 02:31.873
You and your statistics. One point two.

02:31.953 --> 02:37.612
Okay, then I want 2.2,
and I want them to look like you.

02:37.692 --> 02:40.298
Oh, those poor kids.

02:42.564 --> 02:45.320
So, am I gonna be able to drag you
away from the computer tomorrow...

02:45.400 --> 02:47.422
to buy you that ring?

02:47.502 --> 02:49.424
- Sure.
- Yeah?

02:49.504 --> 02:52.427
So, is this gonna be a real wedding?

02:52.507 --> 02:55.530
- As opposed to a fake one?
- You know what I mean, Sam.

02:55.610 --> 02:58.733
You've already been through
the big ceremony with 200 people.

02:58.813 --> 03:02.137
That was the take one. This is the real one.

03:02.217 --> 03:04.139
You can have any kind of a wedding you want.

03:04.219 --> 03:05.640
Underwater.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.666
You can have it at the steam room at the Y.

03:09.090 --> 03:10.535
Horseback.

03:11.993 --> 03:13.939
Naked skydiving?

03:17.399 --> 03:19.821
It's gonna have to be
a small wedding, though.

03:19.901 --> 03:22.991
I haven't been in New York
long enough to know very many people.

03:23.071 --> 03:24.914
Except me.

03:25.974 --> 03:29.331
- Well, you're invited.
- Thank you.

03:29.411 --> 03:32.187
And my friend Graham upstairs.

03:34.416 --> 03:37.863
Won't be long before you know
half the people in New York.

03:39.320 --> 03:43.598
People like you, you know.
But I found you first.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.704
You're the only friend I need.

03:49.431 --> 03:51.775
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

03:53.968 --> 03:55.413
Yeah.

04:08.116 --> 04:09.537
Hello?

04:09.617 --> 04:11.973
This is Lisa. May I speak to Sam?

04:12.053 --> 04:13.999
Hold on a second.

04:17.791 --> 04:21.382
- It's your ex-wile.
- What?

04:21.463 --> 04:23.067
It's Lisa.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.354
- Hello?
- Yeah.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.957
- Sam, we need to talk.
- No.

04:29.037 --> 04:31.826
- Sam, why didn't you call me?
- Because.

04:31.906 --> 04:34.229
- Sam, you can't do this.
- I'm hanging up now.

04:34.309 --> 04:36.255
Sam, don't do this.

04:38.646 --> 04:42.070
I'm sorry. She shouldn't call here.

04:42.150 --> 04:45.097
It's where you live. She's entitled.

04:49.257 --> 04:51.396
Don't answer it.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.586
- Hi, this is Allison Jones.
- Why does she do this?

04:58.666 --> 05:01.289
- Talk to her now. You're up.
- All right.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.391
I'll get that.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.226
Hello, Sam?

05:05.306 --> 05:08.897
Sam, would you pick up the phone, please?

05:08.977 --> 05:12.233
- Please don't do this to me.
- Lisa.

05:12.313 --> 05:15.637
Sam, I've been sitting here
since you left this afternoon.

05:15.717 --> 05:18.440
Yeah, Lisa, honey,
can we talk about this tomorrow?

05:18.520 --> 05:21.142
You can't come over here
and sleep with me, and then...

05:21.222 --> 05:23.611
Allie, how the hell
do you shut this thing off?

05:23.691 --> 05:25.613
Sam, you said you were gonna call.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.333
I've been waiting for your call.

05:31.699 --> 05:34.305
- Hello? Sam?
- Uh-huh.

05:35.570 --> 05:37.709
Okay. Good-bye.

05:43.044 --> 05:46.734
I take it back. She's not entitled.

05:46.814 --> 05:50.605
I didn't go over there
intending to sleep with her, Allie.

05:50.685 --> 05:53.708
Oh, well, I feel a lot better
knowing it was accidental.

05:53.788 --> 05:57.111
She's very depressed, okay?
It was the anniversary of our divorce.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.981
She heard we were getting married,
and she'd been drinking.

06:00.061 --> 06:03.184
- I don't want to hear this.
- I feel bad for her.

06:03.264 --> 06:05.487
I'm moving on. She makes me feel guilty.

06:05.567 --> 06:09.324
- Believe me, it won't happen again.
- Believe you?

06:09.404 --> 06:13.318
I'm supposed to trust you now?
Think about how I feel.

06:19.714 --> 06:21.990
- Jesus, it's 4:00 a.m.
- It's me, Graham.

06:25.119 --> 06:29.577
I'm sorry. It's... Sam left.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.880
I... I told him to.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.873
And, um, I can't be alone tonight.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.619
So I came up here.

06:37.699 --> 06:39.144
Thanks.

06:44.105 --> 06:46.027
Allie, I let you sleep.

06:46.107 --> 06:48.029
- What time is it?
- It's about 10:00.

06:48.109 --> 06:50.198
Oh, my God!

06:50.278 --> 06:52.781
Oh, I've got a meeting.
It's really important.

07:10.765 --> 07:12.754
Hi. I'm sorry I'm a little late.

07:12.834 --> 07:15.337
- No, no. It's worth the wait.
- Thank you.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.560
So.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.995
You can redefine your product on screen...

07:21.075 --> 07:23.865
without going through
an expensive redesign process.

07:23.945 --> 07:27.569
This is Allison Jones software,
a marketing tool no one else has.

07:27.649 --> 07:29.571
Who do I get to run it?

07:29.651 --> 07:32.540
I stay till everyone's up to speed.
That's included in the quote.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.742
Ah, the quote.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.711
That's the one thing I haven't seen.

07:36.791 --> 07:39.203
Best for last.

07:42.964 --> 07:46.487
I think you'll find that's reasonable,
as a ball park.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.514
Here's where I was thinking of playing.

07:57.245 --> 07:59.233
It makes sense for you.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.536
See, after our last meeting,
I made some phone calls.

08:01.616 --> 08:03.605
To your former partner, for one.

08:03.685 --> 08:06.107
Well, I wouldn't rely too much
on what she says.

08:06.187 --> 08:08.776
It was not a friendly split,
and I did all the work.

08:08.856 --> 08:12.380
She took all the credit,
and she didn't like me telling her so.

08:12.460 --> 08:16.584
Well, I was more interested
in the settlement you made.

08:16.664 --> 08:20.355
You walked off with the hardware
and a rent-controlled apartment...

08:20.435 --> 08:24.092
which means your overhead is minimal,
as is your client list.

08:24.172 --> 08:28.696
I could improve that
if you're as good as you say you are.

08:28.776 --> 08:34.034
But that is the only way to prove it.

08:34.115 --> 08:37.938
- Well, I could go for something...
- Oh, no, please, please.

08:38.019 --> 08:41.808
Don't embarrass yourself.
That's my final offer.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.979
Now, of course, if you
would like to think about it.

08:45.059 --> 08:47.005
I'll get this.

08:49.564 --> 08:51.771
You'll see it on my first expense report.

08:53.234 --> 08:54.736
I look forward to it.

09:07.148 --> 09:09.094
No messages.

09:34.275 --> 09:35.963
What is this? A song cue?

09:36.043 --> 09:38.299
You're nobody till somebody loves you.

09:38.379 --> 09:41.302
It's just living alone, you know?

09:41.382 --> 09:44.906
And the thought of buying those books
like Cooking For One.

09:44.986 --> 09:46.641
It's just too depressing.

09:46.721 --> 09:49.544
There are worse things
than being on your own.

09:49.624 --> 09:51.045
You know?

09:51.125 --> 09:54.549
- Maybe it's a sign I should go home.
- You came here for a reason.

09:54.629 --> 09:56.818
Sam has nothing to do with that. No guy does.

09:56.898 --> 09:59.153
You think I'd let some guy
interfere with my acting career?

09:59.233 --> 10:02.623
Assuming I had a career
or a guy to interfere with it.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.625
You'll find someone again.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.294
Maybe I will. Why not?

10:06.374 --> 10:10.865
But the point is, if I don't, I don't.

10:10.945 --> 10:13.668
I know that. I can do it on my own.

10:13.748 --> 10:15.250
Absolutely.

10:17.318 --> 10:19.264
I'll just get a roommate.

10:20.555 --> 10:22.501
You could always call him.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.669
Not if I have a roommate.

10:40.508 --> 10:43.431
The managers couldn't really know
you were going to live there.

10:43.511 --> 10:46.100
Well, that's the problem.
It's rent-stabilized...

10:46.180 --> 10:48.421
so you couldn't come on the lease.

10:49.884 --> 10:51.305
Nice.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.775
It'd really open 'em up.

10:53.855 --> 10:56.699
I can't wait to get in here.
Are you good with tools?

11:06.534 --> 11:08.790
I'm an incest survivor, you know.

11:08.870 --> 11:12.627
I haven't remembered the incident yet,
but I know it's there somewhere.

11:12.707 --> 11:15.296
I just have this sense
that I survived something.

11:15.376 --> 11:17.298
All my therapists think so.

11:17.378 --> 11:19.467
Oh, God, a kitchen! I hate kitchens.

11:19.547 --> 11:22.937
Cooking, cleaning, anything feminine.
I think it's my mother's fault.

11:23.017 --> 11:25.072
I think this could work.

11:25.152 --> 11:28.099
If you feel the same, please give me a call.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.851
Hello? Sam Rawson.

12:09.931 --> 12:11.376
Hello?

12:34.755 --> 12:37.044
- Excuse me.
- Oh, hi.

12:37.124 --> 12:41.115
Hi. The front door was kind of opened.

12:41.195 --> 12:43.384
Are you Allison Jones?

12:43.464 --> 12:44.952
Yes. Allie.

12:45.032 --> 12:47.521
Oh, I'm Hedra Carlson.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.411
We spoke on the phone this morning.

12:53.741 --> 12:55.663
Are you sure you're okay?

12:55.743 --> 13:01.335
Um, you know what? I'm not.

13:01.415 --> 13:05.006
Would it be all right
if you came back tomorrow?

13:05.086 --> 13:07.074
Why don't you just sit down?

13:07.154 --> 13:09.410
- No, I'm fine.
- Let me make you some tea.

13:09.490 --> 13:12.246
I don't think I had lunch, that's all.

13:12.326 --> 13:15.082
It's only this one.
The one in the bathroom works.

13:15.162 --> 13:18.666
Here, let me help. I use a wrench.

13:36.650 --> 13:40.775
Oh, wow! I'm so sorry.

13:40.855 --> 13:44.779
And if you need a reference,
you can call them at Rizzoli.

13:44.859 --> 13:46.805
Oh, thanks.

13:50.464 --> 13:52.466
"Hedra." That's unusual.

13:54.035 --> 13:58.484
I got terrible nicknames growing up,
which I'm not telling you.

13:59.707 --> 14:01.796
Not "Hedy" like Hedy Lamarr?

14:01.876 --> 14:04.065
That's exotic.

14:04.145 --> 14:07.168
Well, I wasn't that exotic in grade school.

14:07.248 --> 14:09.728
As opposed to now, right?

14:13.554 --> 14:15.500
They're dry.

14:19.460 --> 14:21.667
- Here.
- Thanks.

14:23.030 --> 14:27.221
Oh, uh, you can just toss that.
I was just cleaning up.

14:27.301 --> 14:29.590
He's the reason why
I'm looking for a new roommate.

14:29.670 --> 14:33.427
- Oh.
- Yeah.

14:33.507 --> 14:37.598
Do you think there's a chance
you guys might patch things up?

14:37.678 --> 14:40.768
'Cause I don't want to move in
and catch you on the rebound...

14:40.848 --> 14:43.556
and then have things change.

14:44.685 --> 14:46.460
It would just be awkward.

14:47.621 --> 14:50.344
Well, nothing's gonna change, Hedy.

14:50.424 --> 14:54.015
Except for maybe now my faucets will work.

14:54.095 --> 14:56.150
When can you move in?

14:56.230 --> 14:57.675
No, really?

15:05.072 --> 15:08.019
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

15:11.846 --> 15:15.369
I've got one friend, Graham.
He lives right above us.

15:15.449 --> 15:18.406
- A friend?
- Oh, no, not like that. He's gay.

15:18.486 --> 15:22.943
So it's not a real friendly building,
but there's not a problem with privacy.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.881
'Cause you just close your door. No problem.

15:26.961 --> 15:31.218
I'll leave you alone, you know?
I mean, whatever's good for you.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.487
- I don't mind.
- Wow.

15:33.567 --> 15:36.557
Hey, look, Allie.

15:36.637 --> 15:38.241
This could be good, huh?

15:39.607 --> 15:41.796
Laundry room.

15:41.876 --> 15:45.199
I don't go in there at night. Too creepy.

15:45.279 --> 15:48.869
It's okay in the day,
but still, lock yourself in.

15:48.949 --> 15:52.506
- This one?
- No, that's the mail key.

15:52.586 --> 15:54.775
This is creepy.

15:54.855 --> 15:58.564
Oh, it's not bad. It's just kind of old.

15:59.627 --> 16:03.165
Sometimes this gets stuck
and you have to use the screwdriver.

16:06.634 --> 16:08.580
Excuse me.

16:11.205 --> 16:14.361
- Which floor?
- Eleven.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.387
Fourteen, please.

16:28.689 --> 16:31.795
Allie, look what I found.

16:43.204 --> 16:46.727
I'm not sure. Hold on. Let me check.

16:46.807 --> 16:49.378
Allie, it's Sam.

17:00.221 --> 17:02.610
Where did you guys learn to dress like that?

17:02.690 --> 17:05.479
I mean, it's just so New York.

17:05.559 --> 17:09.336
Well, I think you look very comfortable.

17:10.698 --> 17:13.645
Yeah. I never know what looks good.

17:17.738 --> 17:19.660
- I think that looks nice.
- Yeah?

17:19.740 --> 17:22.516
But I found this, which I think
will go great with that.

17:26.247 --> 17:29.103
- Hey, what do you think?
- I think that you should get them.

17:29.183 --> 17:32.006
- Oh, God, you like them?
- I think they go with that dress.

17:32.086 --> 17:34.241
- You take them.
- Well...

17:34.321 --> 17:37.029
I'll just borrow them when I want to.

18:38.319 --> 18:41.027
God! I didn't know you were home.

18:42.890 --> 18:44.494
I was, um...

18:46.493 --> 18:50.050
I was, um... God, I'm sorry.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.701
You haven't even been here two weeks,
and I'm already in your room.

18:55.302 --> 18:58.078
I was just about to go through your drawers.

19:02.076 --> 19:03.998
It smells nice on you.

19:04.078 --> 19:07.434
Oh, I hope you don't mind.
I just always wanted to try that.

19:07.514 --> 19:11.905
Oh, God, no. Anything of mine
that you want, just go ahead.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.641
Share and share alike.

19:13.721 --> 19:17.778
Well, I don't really know about that.
I'm an only child.

19:17.858 --> 19:20.547
Do you come from a big family?

19:20.627 --> 19:23.107
Mm-mm. Just me.

19:28.635 --> 19:33.060
I, um... well, I was supposed to be a twin...

19:33.140 --> 19:36.280
but she was stillborn.

19:37.478 --> 19:38.999
Oh, that's so sad.

19:39.079 --> 19:41.218
I grew up feeling a part of me was missing.

19:42.383 --> 19:43.828
You know?

19:47.454 --> 19:49.661
Allie. God!

19:52.159 --> 19:53.604
It's beautiful.

19:55.129 --> 19:57.051
Thank you.

19:57.131 --> 19:58.786
What do I owe you?

19:58.866 --> 20:01.789
Um, nothing. It's just a little housewarming.

20:01.869 --> 20:04.611
Forget about it.

20:07.708 --> 20:10.120
Oh, no, no.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.539
They look beautiful on you.

20:18.619 --> 20:21.691
- I can't take these.
- It's a housewarming.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.864
Thanks. They're great.

20:28.061 --> 20:30.007
Excuse me.

20:33.333 --> 20:37.558
- Hello?
- It's me. Talk to me.

20:37.638 --> 20:40.861
- No, Sam.
- Why not? I'll just...

20:40.941 --> 20:43.697
No, it's not a good time.

20:43.777 --> 20:46.200
I'm not ready to see you.

20:46.280 --> 20:49.557
You're just prolonging something that's over.

20:50.717 --> 20:53.789
Look, there's nothing to talk about anyway.

20:55.122 --> 20:58.045
Sam, there's somebody here right now.

20:58.125 --> 21:00.347
All right?

21:00.427 --> 21:04.000
Okay. Bye.

21:06.467 --> 21:08.538
Why don't we order some Chinese?

21:16.944 --> 21:21.502
Hi, this is Allison Jones.
Please leave a message. Thank you.

21:21.582 --> 21:25.739
Allie, are you there? Allie, pick up.

21:25.819 --> 21:29.576
Allie, listen. Please call me back.
This is torture for me.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.112
I know you need me as much as I need you.

21:32.192 --> 21:34.681
I love you. I'll do anything
to put this back together.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.570
Just call me.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.489
Buddy.

21:42.569 --> 21:46.093
Oh, yes, what a good, clean boy.

21:46.173 --> 21:48.796
Yeah, you're gonna cheer her up, hmm?

21:48.876 --> 21:51.914
Hmm? You're gonna cheer her up,
and she'll let you stay?

21:55.749 --> 21:57.695
Shh, stay.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.935
Yoo-hoo!

22:15.702 --> 22:17.147
No messages.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.130
I know I shouldn't have.

22:23.210 --> 22:27.801
But they were just giving them away
at the market, and...

22:27.881 --> 22:30.003
Well, they said I could
bring him back tomorrow.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.406
Well, I hope they meant it.

22:32.486 --> 22:33.931
Look.

22:37.391 --> 22:39.513
His name is Buddy.

22:39.593 --> 22:43.473
Oh, I had a dog named Buddy
when I was little, so...

22:50.103 --> 22:52.344
Tomorrow, okay? I promise.

23:19.199 --> 23:21.201
Shh. Oh, come on.

23:22.636 --> 23:25.617
Okay, come on. Shh.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.609
You're working so hard.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.878
Hmm, Myerson better refer some clients to me.

23:44.958 --> 23:46.562
He will. You're the best.

23:47.628 --> 23:49.583
Oh, God! Hedy, thanks.

23:49.663 --> 23:52.405
I never would have
gotten it done without you.

23:53.567 --> 23:56.056
- I love helping.
- Crunch, crunch, crunch.

23:56.136 --> 23:58.058
- What a good boy.
- Wait. Wait.

23:58.138 --> 24:00.327
Come here. Family portrait.

24:00.407 --> 24:02.362
Yeah. All right?

24:02.442 --> 24:04.364
- Ready?
- Yeah.

24:04.444 --> 24:05.889
Buddy.

24:09.650 --> 24:11.972
I lived a few weeks...

24:12.052 --> 24:14.675
while you loved me.

24:14.755 --> 24:16.666
Good-bye, David.

24:29.336 --> 24:31.258
Ready to kill her yet?

24:31.338 --> 24:33.260
- Who? Hedy?
- Mm-hmm.

24:33.340 --> 24:35.762
No, no. It's kind of fun
having a girlfriend again.

24:35.842 --> 24:38.932
I can tell. I was worried
for a while, you were so down.

24:39.012 --> 24:41.288
You were starting to look
like a Kennedy wife.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.938
You were great, Graham.

24:45.018 --> 24:47.341
I've just had to spend some time with her.

24:47.421 --> 24:49.776
She needed a lot of help moving in.

24:49.856 --> 24:53.947
Plus, I've been working like crazy.
I promise I'm not avoiding you.

24:54.027 --> 24:57.718
I've got you cornered now. Actually,
I've been meaning to come and see you.

24:57.798 --> 25:00.454
In fact, I was on my way
to ask you something.

25:00.534 --> 25:04.124
Do you feel like cat sitting again?
I'm going to Boston for a wedding.

25:04.204 --> 25:07.761
- Fun. Sure, I'll watch Carmen.
- Great. I made you a set.

25:07.841 --> 25:10.030
- You know which is which, right?
- Yeah.

25:10.110 --> 25:12.199
And ignore the litter box this time. I do.

25:12.279 --> 25:15.335
That's so cruel. We'll be fine.

25:15.415 --> 25:17.704
You know, I think I saw her
the other day... your roommate.

25:17.784 --> 25:20.540
You were leaving the building.
At least, I thought it was you.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.142
Your backpack, this jacket.

25:22.222 --> 25:24.778
But when I chased you down,
you were someone else...

25:24.858 --> 25:26.446
someone very nervous.

25:26.526 --> 25:31.318
Oh, that's Hedy. I've freaked her out
about people knowing she's living here.

25:31.398 --> 25:34.936
I would have had you down
to meet her, but she's shy.

25:36.737 --> 25:38.307
Well.

25:42.075 --> 25:44.731
- Friday.
- That'd be great.

25:44.811 --> 25:46.757
Make you dinner when I get back.

26:01.161 --> 26:03.583
Hey, I thought you'd be at work.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.686
Don't tell me we have the same belt.

26:05.766 --> 26:07.754
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

26:07.834 --> 26:10.757
- Listen, I have to talk to you.
- You have to see these. Look.

26:10.837 --> 26:14.494
- Cookies for dogs. I had to get them.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

26:14.574 --> 26:17.064
Can you talk to me for a second?

26:17.144 --> 26:19.886
Woof!

26:24.284 --> 26:26.924
I tried to let you know.

26:32.893 --> 26:34.815
What are you doing here? Hedy.

26:34.895 --> 26:38.251
No, don't blame Hedy.
It's not her fault, okay?

26:38.331 --> 26:42.956
I kind of forced my way in here.
I had to see you.

26:43.036 --> 26:46.745
Listen, I've got to get out of here now.

26:48.175 --> 26:50.519
Unless you need me.

27:00.487 --> 27:02.763
Why can't you just leave me alone?

27:05.959 --> 27:09.783
You gotta talk to me, baby.
You just can't pretend that I don't exist.

27:09.863 --> 27:13.587
It's easier that way, okay? Is that
so wrong trying to make it easier on me?

27:13.667 --> 27:16.289
But people screw up.
People do something wrong.

27:16.369 --> 27:20.427
And it was wrong, I admit it.
And you just cut them off.

27:20.507 --> 27:23.530
You don't take my calls.
You don't answer my letter.

27:23.610 --> 27:25.999
Wait a minute. You lied to me!

27:26.079 --> 27:28.502
If she hadn't called, would I have found out?

27:28.582 --> 27:31.222
I think that's really scary, okay?

27:32.652 --> 27:35.929
Please, Sam, if you want
to be nice, just stay away.

27:41.428 --> 27:44.718
I know that there are some things
that you just can't put back together...

27:44.798 --> 27:46.953
and I was hoping that this
wasn't one of them.

27:47.033 --> 27:48.808
Well, I guess it is.

27:51.104 --> 27:54.060
And I didn't get any letter...

27:54.140 --> 27:56.797
so I wasn't trying to punish you
by not answering it.

27:56.877 --> 27:58.732
I just didn't get it.

27:58.812 --> 28:00.267
I sent it with the keys.

28:00.347 --> 28:02.725
Well, I didn't get those, either.

28:04.718 --> 28:07.140
What did it say?

28:07.220 --> 28:09.743
Forget the letter.

28:09.823 --> 28:11.745
I love you.

28:11.825 --> 28:14.648
I can't exist without you.

28:14.728 --> 28:17.217
I have no excuse for what I did.

28:17.297 --> 28:20.972
Allie, you have to give me a second chance.

28:29.709 --> 28:32.280
You really hurt me, Sam.

28:57.971 --> 29:00.861
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where the biography section is?

29:00.941 --> 29:04.030
- Towards the front against the wall.
- Thanks.

29:04.110 --> 29:08.456
Hi. This is Allison Jones.
Please leave a message. Thank you.

29:09.516 --> 29:11.204
Hi, Allie. It's me.

29:11.284 --> 29:14.140
Um, I'm just calling to see if you're okay.

29:14.220 --> 29:17.744
Uh, call me at work, okay?

29:17.824 --> 29:19.746
My number's on the fridge.

29:19.826 --> 29:22.306
Okay. Bye.

29:26.032 --> 29:28.221
Say, next month.
Would that give her enough time?

29:28.301 --> 29:30.390
I don't know.
We've just gotten her settled in.

29:30.470 --> 29:32.973
Hedy's been wonderful.
I'm sure she'll understand.

29:37.377 --> 29:38.798
Evening, Mr. Rawson.

29:38.878 --> 29:41.552
I have an idea I must be in love with you.

29:43.550 --> 29:46.773
Has it hit you that way?

29:46.853 --> 29:50.266
Hey! It's not for you.

29:52.659 --> 29:55.248
Would you like it to go on for always?

29:55.328 --> 29:57.417
Does anything go on for always?

29:57.497 --> 30:00.239
Well, one likes to think some things do.

31:15.208 --> 31:17.449
Where the hell have you been?

31:20.080 --> 31:24.170
God! Hedy, what are you doing in my room?

31:24.250 --> 31:28.375
I've been waiting since 6:00
last night to hear from you.

31:28.455 --> 31:31.911
I've been worried sick.
Buddy was crying all night.

31:31.991 --> 31:34.681
I finally had to come in here
so he'd calm down.

31:34.761 --> 31:36.683
I'm sorry. I guess I just didn't think.

31:36.763 --> 31:40.353
No, you didn't. There's such a thing
as a phone, you know?

31:40.433 --> 31:42.856
This is New York. Things happen.

31:42.936 --> 31:47.476
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
It was thoughtless, really.

31:49.909 --> 31:52.150
You're making me feel
like I'm 16 years old here.

31:58.218 --> 31:59.663
Hey.

32:02.088 --> 32:05.645
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

32:05.725 --> 32:08.915
Yeah, I just...

32:08.995 --> 32:10.941
Forget it.

32:13.533 --> 32:17.357
So, I guess you patched things up
with Sam, huh?

32:17.437 --> 32:20.213
Yeah. Well, I made him suffer.

32:21.541 --> 32:24.852
- Is that an engagement ring?
- Oh, well, I...

32:32.619 --> 32:35.375
It's a beautiful ring.

32:35.455 --> 32:37.377
Thanks.

32:37.457 --> 32:39.379
Really great.

32:39.459 --> 32:41.848
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

32:41.928 --> 32:43.917
You'll be very happy, and I'll be alone.

32:43.997 --> 32:46.553
No, wait a minute. You'll find someone, Hedy.

32:46.633 --> 32:48.408
I mean, God, if I can.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.976
Why don't you look in the mirror? Huh?

32:57.177 --> 32:58.622
Look.

32:59.913 --> 33:04.437
You're in a different league. I know that.

33:04.517 --> 33:07.574
You have this great personality.

33:07.654 --> 33:09.943
You've got this great style.

33:10.023 --> 33:12.401
You're running your own business.

33:13.526 --> 33:16.473
You are always gonna find someone.

33:18.198 --> 33:21.145
You'd have to be stupid
to think that you wouldn't.

33:30.310 --> 33:33.967
Well, I guess you and Sam
want to be together...

33:34.047 --> 33:38.238
so I have to move out, right?

33:38.318 --> 33:41.107
- Huh?
- Well, not right away.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.109
Sam's gonna keep his place for a while...

33:43.189 --> 33:45.311
and I know you just spent a lot on furniture.

33:45.391 --> 33:50.183
Yeah, your timing is great, Allie.
It's really great.

33:50.263 --> 33:53.586
You promised me that this
wouldn't happen. Exactly this.

33:53.666 --> 33:56.723
Nothing's happened, Hedy. Come on.

33:56.803 --> 33:59.716
I mean... Look, I'll talk to Sam.

34:01.674 --> 34:06.232
Maybe we'll move. I don't know.
Maybe we'll find someplace like this.

34:06.312 --> 34:10.487
I don't know. But We'll see.
We'll figure something out.

34:15.388 --> 34:17.010
They tell me they're nervous.

34:17.090 --> 34:19.478
Of course they're nervous.
They want to be sold.

34:19.559 --> 34:21.681
Let's set up a demo at the staff meeting.

34:21.761 --> 34:23.850
Something special,
something different, you know?

34:23.929 --> 34:27.487
Maybe at night.
You know, open bar, open minds.

34:27.567 --> 34:30.255
- That's "F9".
- I'll set it up.

34:30.335 --> 34:33.760
Maybe I'll call you tonight
after I check on some things.

34:33.840 --> 34:35.728
Great.

34:35.808 --> 34:38.764
What's "8796, Knox"? Who's this Knox?

34:38.844 --> 34:42.101
Oh, no, that's Graham Knox.
He's my upstairs neighbor.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.969
It's the first one.

34:44.050 --> 34:47.574
You know, I've got to admit
I'm very impressed.

34:47.654 --> 34:49.690
Well, maybe you'll start spreading the word.

34:51.224 --> 34:55.400
You know, I could see I'm not
gonna be able to afford you anymore.

34:59.465 --> 35:02.639
Great. Just press "ENTER". That's it.

35:16.649 --> 35:18.595
You thirsty?

35:23.156 --> 35:26.103
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

35:43.643 --> 35:46.749
Well, you would know
more about that than I would.

35:52.719 --> 35:54.164
Oh, hi.

35:55.621 --> 35:58.295
Allie, do you want to sit?

36:01.728 --> 36:05.251
Oh, well, I guess I'll turn in.

36:05.331 --> 36:08.540
Good night, Allie. Night, Sam.

38:23.503 --> 38:25.847
- They're ready.
- All right. Just a minute.

38:26.906 --> 38:28.561
They'll get cold.

38:28.641 --> 38:30.746
All right, all right.

38:46.058 --> 38:48.414
Rawson, actually, is a Norse name.

38:48.494 --> 38:50.850
- A what?
- Norse.

38:50.930 --> 38:53.953
Well, it's thoroughly uninteresting.

38:54.033 --> 38:56.189
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:56.269 --> 38:58.215
We going?

39:04.477 --> 39:05.898
Scrambled or tried?

39:05.978 --> 39:07.924
This is fine.

39:14.153 --> 39:16.909
Allie, sweetheart,
this isn't all that urgent.

39:16.989 --> 39:20.112
You know, if you don't want to do
this apartment thing today...

39:20.192 --> 39:22.615
it can wait until I get back.

39:22.695 --> 39:26.419
Why don't we get away together,
drive to Bucks County?

39:26.499 --> 39:29.589
- Buddy! Come here, boy.
- A bed and breakfast?

39:29.669 --> 39:31.390
Come on. Three's a crowd, sweetie.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.260
It's all right, Hedy. He's fine.

39:34.340 --> 39:36.696
Poor guy doesn't know who's who anymore.

39:36.776 --> 39:39.165
Why don't you and I take
a day off, rent a car...

39:39.245 --> 39:42.335
No, that's okay. I'm fine.

39:42.415 --> 39:45.404
I just didn't get
a very good sleep, that's all.

39:45.484 --> 39:48.624
Nightmares. Thanks.

39:51.223 --> 39:55.982
You guys got a good day for it,
if it doesn't get too hot.

39:56.062 --> 39:59.652
You don't have to do that, Hedy.
You do enough already.

39:59.732 --> 40:01.754
Oh, I don't mind.

40:01.834 --> 40:04.390
It's clean when you can't tell I'm here.

40:04.470 --> 40:05.949
Oh!

40:07.540 --> 40:11.497
Hey, if the eggs were okay, maybe
you guys would trust me with dinner.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.366
Do you guys know when you'll be back?

40:13.446 --> 40:18.070
It's kind of an anniversary tonight,
so I think we're gonna eat out.

40:18.150 --> 40:22.542
Really? Wow, that's great.

40:22.622 --> 40:25.077
Um, well, good luck.

40:25.157 --> 40:27.398
Thanks.

40:35.835 --> 40:37.781
Good-bye.

40:46.012 --> 40:48.014
Buddy, come here.

40:50.249 --> 40:52.195
Come here, sweetie.

40:54.086 --> 40:55.531
I know.

40:57.056 --> 40:58.501
I know.

41:02.261 --> 41:05.208
Buddy, come! Come!

41:10.336 --> 41:12.258
Fine.

41:12.338 --> 41:15.428
But this is hall the size
for twice the price of our place.

41:15.508 --> 41:18.564
- You're far too nice to Hedy.
- It's easier this way, believe me.

41:18.644 --> 41:21.267
And this could be nice.

41:21.347 --> 41:24.003
Can you imagine going
from the Victoria to this?

41:24.083 --> 41:26.172
Do you think we could smoke her out?

41:26.252 --> 41:28.507
It would be such a mess.
I just can't do it to her.

41:28.587 --> 41:30.965
I think I'm her only friend.

41:32.024 --> 41:33.579
My God! What happened?

41:33.659 --> 41:36.139
He's fallen from one of those balconies.

41:43.869 --> 41:47.693
He's dead! Buddy's dead!

41:47.773 --> 41:49.095
What?

41:49.175 --> 41:51.097
You left the window open!

41:51.177 --> 41:53.366
How could you do that?

41:53.446 --> 41:55.935
But I thought we could leave it open.

41:56.015 --> 41:57.937
I thought you fixed it this morning.

41:58.017 --> 42:00.373
I thought I did.

42:00.453 --> 42:05.745
It's me. I interrupted you
when I called you in for breakfast.

42:05.825 --> 42:07.827
Allie, it's my fault.

42:42.961 --> 42:45.350
Thanks. That pill helped.

42:45.430 --> 42:47.910
You still going on that trip tomorrow?

42:50.402 --> 42:53.679
Well, you know, she wants me to.

42:59.344 --> 43:03.986
If I had just let you finish
your work this morning...

43:09.454 --> 43:14.494
Listen. If she blames anybody,
she blames me. Okay?

43:23.468 --> 43:25.243
All right, come on. Shh.

44:14.653 --> 44:16.241
Hello?

44:16.321 --> 44:17.925
Hi, Mitch.

44:19.591 --> 44:21.195
What?

44:22.427 --> 44:25.784
Oh, God. I don't know. I'm...

44:25.864 --> 44:29.888
No, I just... I'm just running
a little late. I didn't forget.

44:29.968 --> 44:31.557
No, no. I...

44:31.637 --> 44:35.141
Just hold him till 5:00, okay? Thanks.

45:43.208 --> 45:46.765
You were terrific.
But you know that, don't you?

45:46.845 --> 45:48.449
Thank you.

45:49.915 --> 45:52.004
And here I thought...

45:52.084 --> 45:54.325
all the guys would resist you.

45:55.887 --> 45:57.809
As if anyone ever could.

45:57.889 --> 46:00.612
Oh, no, thank you. I gotta go.
I'm just cleaning up.

46:00.692 --> 46:03.882
Now hold it. Hold it. Not so fast.

46:03.962 --> 46:07.352
Now, everybody under me knows more than I do.

46:07.432 --> 46:09.921
I hate that.

46:10.001 --> 46:13.558
Well, block off some time for me
next week then.

46:13.638 --> 46:15.560
It's a little late tonight.

46:15.640 --> 46:17.329
Oh, please. Please.

46:17.409 --> 46:20.913
Just a taste. Something simple.

46:21.613 --> 46:23.217
Right now.

46:32.491 --> 46:34.095
Something simple.

46:38.730 --> 46:40.334
All right.

46:42.234 --> 46:45.824
Now, this is just the Mickey Mouse
stuff, but it does come in handy.

46:45.904 --> 46:47.542
Uh-huh.

46:49.408 --> 46:51.730
Okay, enter the vendor's name.

46:51.810 --> 46:54.499
Oh, vendor:

46:54.579 --> 46:57.719
J-O-N-E-S...

46:58.850 --> 47:01.353
Allison.

47:02.287 --> 47:04.076
Very good.

47:04.156 --> 47:07.846
Here you go. Contract price.
Payments to date. Balance outstanding.

47:07.926 --> 47:12.451
Uh-oh. According to this,
we should've paid you last Friday.

47:12.531 --> 47:14.519
That's all right. Barbara will handle it.

47:14.599 --> 47:16.545
Not till I give her the word.

47:18.603 --> 47:20.992
I hope you're satisfied with what I've done.

47:21.072 --> 47:22.176
So far.

47:23.141 --> 47:25.063
But this is it.

47:25.143 --> 47:27.555
I mean, well, there ain't much more.

47:28.547 --> 47:31.527
Except for a little tine tuning, that's it.

47:32.184 --> 47:35.674
I have some free time if you want to
set up some meetings with your colleagues.

47:35.754 --> 47:39.327
I was thinking maybe I wanna
keep you all to myself.

47:43.028 --> 47:45.150
- Topper.
- What are you doing?

47:45.230 --> 47:49.121
It's just that you're so tight right in here.

47:49.201 --> 47:51.340
Don't. That's enough.

47:53.071 --> 47:55.327
- Now look...
- Come on.

47:55.407 --> 47:57.863
I've been a good boy, haven't I?

47:57.943 --> 48:02.100
You've been a good girl,
and we have nothing to prove anymore.

48:02.180 --> 48:07.129
Look. This is your last chance to play
before you're an old married lady.

48:10.589 --> 48:12.569
Let me turn around, okay?

48:14.626 --> 48:16.230
That's better.

48:22.067 --> 48:24.411
Just a second.

48:33.478 --> 48:34.923
Fuckin' bitch!

48:40.151 --> 48:42.392
Here. Take this.

48:47.325 --> 48:49.430
I can't believe I didn't see it coming.

48:52.197 --> 48:55.020
It's just so humiliating.

48:55.100 --> 48:57.889
You're too nice. That's the problem.

48:57.969 --> 49:01.246
Men are pigs.
I don't care how nice they seem.

49:04.442 --> 49:06.422
You always fall for that.

49:09.581 --> 49:11.356
But what I did...

49:12.884 --> 49:15.888
it was like something inside taking over.

49:18.189 --> 49:19.911
It was scary.

49:19.991 --> 49:22.481
No, Allie, don't turn this around.

49:22.561 --> 49:24.249
You're the victim.

49:24.329 --> 49:26.718
He should pay for this.

49:26.798 --> 49:30.555
He'll pay. I set up all my programs
so that they have to, eventually.

49:30.635 --> 49:36.561
What? I'm not talking about getting paid.
I'm talking about getting even.

49:36.641 --> 49:42.267
You don't understand.
It's the contacts more than the money.

49:42.347 --> 49:46.124
I just took the job for the word
of mouth, and now that's gone.

49:47.152 --> 49:49.689
It's like he's put me back to square one.

49:50.522 --> 49:53.696
Only if you let him.
You won't let him, will you?

49:54.526 --> 49:55.971
What can I do?

49:57.495 --> 49:59.099
Oh, Allie.

50:06.605 --> 50:08.448
And, of course, Sam's away.

50:10.675 --> 50:12.664
I didn't wanna say anything.

50:12.744 --> 50:16.401
How he could go on that trip
the day after Buddy died...

50:16.481 --> 50:18.757
especially when it was his fault.

50:26.625 --> 50:29.614
Hello. May I speak with your husband, please?

50:29.694 --> 50:31.349
Who are you calling?

50:31.429 --> 50:35.654
Yes, I know it's late. Tell him it's
Allison Jones. He'll take the call.

50:35.734 --> 50:37.680
What are you doing?

50:41.239 --> 50:43.495
Listen, you pathetic shit.

50:43.575 --> 50:45.964
You wanna hold on to your business?

50:46.044 --> 50:49.467
No, you listen to me this time, asshole.

50:49.547 --> 50:52.437
If you trash me around town, you are fucked.

50:52.517 --> 50:55.774
And your family is fucked too, you got that?

50:55.854 --> 50:57.800
It won't just be you.

51:02.560 --> 51:03.664
Ta-da!

51:06.731 --> 51:09.769
Let me tell you,
he is pissing in his pj's right now.

51:11.569 --> 51:14.175
Gee, Hedy, I hope you never get mad at me.

51:16.508 --> 51:20.854
- We really have to talk.
- Please. I have a surprise for you.

51:25.383 --> 51:27.772
Oh, Hedy, I'm really not up for this today.

51:27.852 --> 51:29.808
What? No, no, no.

51:29.888 --> 51:33.678
It's gonna be tun. It'll make you
feel better. I promise. Okay?

51:33.758 --> 51:35.347
And I'm paying.

51:35.427 --> 51:37.031
So...

51:38.596 --> 51:41.236
It'll be fine. Come on.

51:44.469 --> 51:46.073
Thank you.

51:59.851 --> 52:01.330
You've gotta be kidding.

52:07.492 --> 52:10.949
- You just should've asked first.
- I wanted it to be a surprise.

52:11.029 --> 52:13.485
- Can I have Consulting Marketplace?
- Sure.

52:13.565 --> 52:15.943
This feels so good on my neck.

52:18.536 --> 52:20.311
I didn't think you'd mind.

52:21.740 --> 52:23.686
Thanks.

52:39.357 --> 52:41.303
I'm gonna take a shower.

53:45.824 --> 53:47.770
"Ellen Besch"?

54:18.489 --> 54:20.435
Sam.

55:13.244 --> 55:15.850
Want me to fix you something before I go?

55:17.615 --> 55:20.926
No, thanks. I'm just gonna
go up and visit Graham.

55:22.253 --> 55:24.909
- I love myself like this.
- Have fun.

55:24.989 --> 55:26.093
Yeah.

55:30.662 --> 55:32.801
I love myself like this.

56:16.607 --> 56:18.211
Taxi!

56:19.410 --> 56:21.014
Hey!

56:31.823 --> 56:35.566
Don't lose her. It's very important.
She has something oi mine.

57:26.144 --> 57:27.748
Hey. Come on.

57:49.567 --> 57:51.342
Do you wanna play?

57:52.737 --> 57:54.410
No, thanks.

58:10.555 --> 58:12.910
Come on, Jim.

58:12.990 --> 58:15.847
Allie. Hey, Allie. Regular or diet?

58:15.927 --> 58:17.849
Diet.

58:17.929 --> 58:20.084
- Something's different.
- Yes.

58:20.164 --> 58:22.644
Jim, you look like my sisters boyfriend.

58:23.668 --> 58:25.156
Jesus, what is it?

58:25.236 --> 58:29.707
You've gotta help me, Graham.
You've gotta tell me what to do.

58:35.012 --> 58:36.616
I'm home.

58:49.961 --> 58:51.582
Goddamn it.

58:51.662 --> 58:53.684
It's so weird.

58:53.764 --> 58:55.987
It was like looking at myself.

58:56.067 --> 58:57.789
And she lies.

58:57.869 --> 59:00.725
I found a shoe box in her room.

59:00.805 --> 59:03.061
Nothing she told me is true.

59:03.141 --> 59:07.231
Like, the twin who she said died at birth.

59:07.311 --> 59:10.087
It was in an accident when she was nine.

59:11.382 --> 59:15.159
And she stole a letter that Sam wrote me.

59:19.257 --> 59:22.313
- I have to do something.
- Get rid of her.

59:22.393 --> 59:24.682
Call the police if you have to.

59:24.762 --> 59:28.039
If she's lying and stealing,
you've got to get her out of there.

59:29.734 --> 59:32.340
You're right. I'll tell her tonight.

59:33.671 --> 59:36.327
I can't just throw her out on the street.

59:36.407 --> 59:39.130
- She obviously needs help.
- She's a lunatic.

59:39.210 --> 59:41.622
She's got to go. Do it tonight.

59:43.314 --> 59:46.537
I feel responsible somehow,
like I'm the only one she has.

59:46.617 --> 59:48.392
Except for maybe her parents.

59:49.620 --> 59:52.226
Either she's gone by Saturday,
or I go to the police.

59:55.359 --> 59:56.804
That was very impressive.

59:58.029 --> 01:00:01.119
I can be butch when I have to.
I get it from my mother.

01:00:01.199 --> 01:00:04.822
If you're worried about her,
I know a shrink. Maybe he can help.

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:07.925
Oh, God. Well, maybe after
I talk to her she'll just leave.

01:00:08.005 --> 01:00:12.363
- Do you wanna sleep here tonight?
- Look, don't tempt me.

01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:14.599
I just needed to talk it out.

01:00:14.679 --> 01:00:16.283
Thanks.

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:22.807
She's not gonna chase me out of my own place.

01:00:22.887 --> 01:00:24.642
When's Sam coming back?

01:00:24.722 --> 01:00:26.677
Oh, tomorrow.

01:00:26.757 --> 01:00:29.313
- That's good.
- Yeah.

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:32.183
Oh. This is a little embarrassing...

01:00:32.263 --> 01:00:35.186
but since we're letting our hair down...

01:00:35.266 --> 01:00:38.389
these little air vents
between our apartments...

01:00:38.469 --> 01:00:40.525
carry sound.

01:00:40.605 --> 01:00:42.551
It's a weird acoustic thing.

01:00:43.874 --> 01:00:46.684
Well, what do you hear?

01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:51.302
Oh, no.

01:00:51.382 --> 01:00:54.739
Oh, no. God. I am... I am so embarrassed.

01:00:54.819 --> 01:00:56.974
Big deal. I'm sorry
I didn't mention it sooner.

01:00:57.054 --> 01:01:00.866
- I am so sorry.
- You sure you wanna go down there?

01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:07.251
Yeah.

01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:09.777
She's my problem. I'll handle it.

01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:14.577
- Thank you for the tea.
- You're welcome.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.381
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:02:07.625 --> 01:02:10.881
Jesus. It's a lot more serious
than I thought.

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:13.851
No. I know you can't diagnose over the phone.

01:02:13.931 --> 01:02:18.289
I don't know what hyper-vigilant is.
Phil, I never met the woman.

01:02:18.369 --> 01:02:21.680
She could be infantile
or paranoid. I don't...

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:37.074
Let me go downstairs. If I call you
from there, will you talk to my friend?

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:40.077
- She can tell you better than I.
- Fine. Call when you get there.

01:02:40.157 --> 01:02:41.898
Right. Okay?

01:02:44.128 --> 01:02:45.916
Thanks. So, all right...

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:50.604
You might here from us. Love to Jack,
and you're not charging me for this.

01:02:58.709 --> 01:03:00.746
Carmen.

01:03:10.321 --> 01:03:11.595
Good night.

01:03:15.259 --> 01:03:16.863
I'm sorry.

01:03:18.229 --> 01:03:19.750
- Wait.
- What?

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:24.155
It's okay. Take it easy.
We just want to get you some help.

01:03:24.235 --> 01:03:27.992
No, please. Please!
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:03:28.072 --> 01:03:29.560
Take it easy.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.629
I'm sorry. I didn't do anything.

01:03:31.709 --> 01:03:32.744
I know.

01:03:41.952 --> 01:03:46.811
Hello, Mr. Besch. You don't know me.
My name is Allison Jones.

01:03:46.891 --> 01:03:51.015
I think my roommate, Hedra,
is your daughter... Ellen...

01:03:51.095 --> 01:03:52.972
I'm not sure, really.

01:03:54.665 --> 01:03:59.114
She's... she's been under
a lot of stress lately...

01:04:00.271 --> 01:04:02.393
and well...

01:04:02.473 --> 01:04:06.297
God. I really would rather not
get into this on an answering machine.

01:04:06.377 --> 01:04:09.667
Could you please give me a call? Or her?

01:04:09.747 --> 01:04:14.638
I'm sure you have the phone number.
It's 212-555-9814.

01:04:14.718 --> 01:04:18.063
I'd really appreciate it,
and don't say I called.

01:04:18.889 --> 01:04:20.391
Oh, thank you.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:42.982
What?

01:04:46.183 --> 01:04:48.129
Are you all right?

01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:51.859
I can't hear you.

01:04:55.493 --> 01:05:00.251
It's okay. I was just starting to worry.
You've been in here so long.

01:05:00.331 --> 01:05:04.108
I'm making some tea.
You want some tea? Chamomile.

01:05:07.605 --> 01:05:09.209
Yeah.

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:13.419
That'd be great.

01:05:21.852 --> 01:05:23.593
I'm not feeling well.

01:05:31.228 --> 01:05:35.040
Mine always comes
when I'm wearing something nice.

01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:44.518
Are you crampy? Sometimes tea helps.

01:05:45.142 --> 01:05:46.931
Something warm.

01:05:47.011 --> 01:05:48.957
And we could talk.

01:05:50.714 --> 01:05:52.318
About what?

01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:57.107
About Sam and I wanting
this place for ourselves.

01:05:57.187 --> 01:06:01.329
It's just crazy keeping two places like this.

01:06:03.894 --> 01:06:09.320
I thought you wanted a long engagement
to be sure you can trust him again.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.438
Well, frankly, Hedy, that's my business.

01:06:13.637 --> 01:06:15.860
I'm sorry, but it is.

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:17.544
Uh-huh.

01:06:19.643 --> 01:06:22.089
It's... it's me, isn't it?

01:06:26.951 --> 01:06:29.807
I'll change, Allie. I can change.

01:06:29.887 --> 01:06:32.776
No. That's not it at all.

01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:34.767
You've been a good roommate.

01:06:35.693 --> 01:06:38.749
It's just that this is the man
I'm gonna marry.

01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:41.332
I want us to start our lives together.

01:06:44.335 --> 01:06:45.789
Well...

01:06:45.869 --> 01:06:47.625
he will cheat on you again.

01:06:47.705 --> 01:06:50.094
That's a promise.

01:06:50.174 --> 01:06:53.964
And when he does,
don't come running to me, okay?

01:06:54.044 --> 01:06:56.786
'Cause I've had it with you.

01:06:57.581 --> 01:06:59.356
You're so fucking weak.

01:07:05.022 --> 01:07:06.626
I'm sorry.

01:07:07.725 --> 01:07:09.568
I'm so sorry.

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:27.298
Hello?

01:07:27.378 --> 01:07:28.365
Sam?

01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:30.534
Ellen, is that you?

01:07:30.614 --> 01:07:32.803
Talk to me, or your mother.

01:07:32.883 --> 01:07:35.306
Honey, we miss you. We want you to come home.

01:07:35.386 --> 01:07:38.409
- Don't call here again.
- Listen to me.

01:07:38.489 --> 01:07:41.612
We'll stop sending the checks
if you don't come.

01:07:41.692 --> 01:07:45.640
Promise. No doctors this time. Just come...

01:07:49.967 --> 01:07:52.743
An obscene phone call. New York.

01:07:55.305 --> 01:07:57.561
Find someone else, jerk!

01:07:57.641 --> 01:08:00.965
I'm expecting a call from Sam.
He might be coming in tonight.

01:08:01.045 --> 01:08:04.049
Just for a little while, okay?
Sam'll call back if it's busy.

01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:07.520
I'm sorry.

01:08:08.452 --> 01:08:11.308
It's no big deal. I'll find some other place.

01:08:11.388 --> 01:08:14.044
I just... I don't want you making a mistake.

01:08:14.124 --> 01:08:15.728
I understand.

01:08:17.261 --> 01:08:19.798
Hey, we'll still be friends, keep in touch.

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:22.707
Sure.

01:08:47.825 --> 01:08:49.279
Hello?

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:50.948
No, it's Hedy.

01:08:51.028 --> 01:08:53.304
Hi. Where are you?

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:57.321
I just came in from the airport.
Is she asleep?

01:08:57.401 --> 01:08:59.323
Yeah.

01:08:59.403 --> 01:09:01.191
It's after 2:00.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:02.993
Should I wake her?

01:09:03.073 --> 01:09:05.178
Yeah, tell her to surprise me.

01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:09.667
- I'll tell her.
- Good night, Hedy.

01:09:09.747 --> 01:09:11.602
Good night, Sam.

01:09:11.682 --> 01:09:13.286
Sleep well.

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:05.271
What? What?

01:10:07.538 --> 01:10:09.827
Hey, Allie, what are you doing here?

01:10:09.907 --> 01:10:11.511
Shh.

01:10:23.821 --> 01:10:26.199
Oh, geez.

01:10:38.936 --> 01:10:40.691
No, I'm not Allie.

01:10:40.771 --> 01:10:42.910
Well... No...

01:11:48.639 --> 01:11:50.243
Hey.

01:11:54.778 --> 01:11:56.553
Hey, sleepy guy.

01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:04.123
I knew it.

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:08.345
Knew what?

01:12:08.425 --> 01:12:09.947
I told her.

01:12:10.027 --> 01:12:12.816
Guys like you don't change.

01:12:12.896 --> 01:12:14.807
You can't be faithful.

01:12:15.499 --> 01:12:17.604
And now she'll know, hmm?

01:12:20.504 --> 01:12:22.108
She'll know what?

01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:29.333
That you came up here
and pretended to be her?

01:12:29.413 --> 01:12:33.270
I mean, my God, what is this hair?
What is this supposed to mean?

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:36.524
You're in her clothes.
You're wearing her perfume.

01:12:42.326 --> 01:12:44.214
You knew it was me.

01:12:44.294 --> 01:12:47.551
Come on. You knew...

01:12:47.631 --> 01:12:49.577
and you didn't care.

01:12:51.768 --> 01:12:53.523
Well...

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:55.879
I think she should know that.

01:12:56.673 --> 01:12:59.779
You think she's gonna thank you
for that news, do ya?

01:13:00.811 --> 01:13:04.368
Well, I don't expect you
to understand our friendship.

01:13:04.448 --> 01:13:07.429
Oh, she cannot fuckin' stand you,
for Christ's sake!

01:13:09.586 --> 01:13:12.509
- That's not true.
- Aw, bullshit!

01:13:12.589 --> 01:13:14.511
- Mm-mm.
- You're too needy.

01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:18.038
You're always clingy.
You're constantly in her face.

01:13:18.996 --> 01:13:21.318
She needs me.

01:13:21.398 --> 01:13:24.988
Who was there for her when
her boss almost raped her, hmm?

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:27.190
- What?
- Who took care of her?

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:29.927
You were off on a business trip
or screwing someone.

01:13:30.007 --> 01:13:32.229
She never said a word to me about that.

01:13:32.309 --> 01:13:34.448
That's right. She told me.

01:13:36.213 --> 01:13:41.905
So, don't try and make me think
that we're not close.

01:13:41.985 --> 01:13:47.025
We lean on each other,
and we protect each other.

01:13:48.358 --> 01:13:51.134
We're best friends.

01:13:52.496 --> 01:13:54.442
You're nuts, you know that?

01:13:57.367 --> 01:14:00.109
I think you're outta your skull.

01:14:03.373 --> 01:14:06.596
Yeah, well, sticks and bones, okay?

01:14:06.676 --> 01:14:08.280
Oh, man. Man.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.692
- Don't touch me.
- I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry.

01:14:14.384 --> 01:14:16.473
Look...

01:14:16.553 --> 01:14:19.076
I know you wanna save face.

01:14:19.156 --> 01:14:21.678
I won't tell her. Okay?

01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:24.982
Just... Just pick up the phone
and call her...

01:14:25.062 --> 01:14:28.669
and tell her that you're going back
to your ex-wife or something.

01:14:29.733 --> 01:14:31.555
I won't say a word.

01:14:31.635 --> 01:14:34.624
Yeah. Well, you won't have to say
a word, sweetheart...

01:14:34.704 --> 01:14:37.514
because I'm gonna tell her myself.

01:14:39.109 --> 01:14:40.611
Fuckin' bitch!

01:14:58.428 --> 01:15:00.032
Hey.

01:15:06.136 --> 01:15:09.345
I'm sorry, sir, but the party
doesn't seem to have checked in.

01:15:11.374 --> 01:15:13.830
Yes, sir. Why don't you try again later?

01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:17.153
That'll be fine. Good night, Miss Jones.

01:15:20.383 --> 01:15:22.294
Good night.

01:16:02.993 --> 01:16:04.748
Oh, hi.

01:16:04.828 --> 01:16:08.218
I hope I didn't wake you.
I got an early start.

01:16:08.298 --> 01:16:11.245
No, Hedy, I didn't mean for you
to move out today.

01:16:12.736 --> 01:16:15.192
There, I'm done. See?

01:16:15.272 --> 01:16:20.430
I hope you don't mind. I'm storing some
of my stuff in the cage downstairs.

01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:23.957
That way I won't have to bother
you two when I move.

01:16:25.015 --> 01:16:26.619
Sure, that's fine.

01:16:27.918 --> 01:16:30.707
Look, I'm really sorry it didn't work out.

01:16:30.787 --> 01:16:32.342
Well...

01:16:32.422 --> 01:16:35.512
I better get this stuff out of here.

01:16:35.592 --> 01:16:37.280
I'll help.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.982
I'll open the door.

01:16:39.062 --> 01:16:41.201
We can have breakfast when you get back.

01:17:25.909 --> 01:17:27.964
And now, morning news break.

01:17:28.044 --> 01:17:30.217
We go to midtown Manhattan...

01:17:35.252 --> 01:17:38.875
Police found the body of a man
brutally murdered early this morning.

01:17:38.955 --> 01:17:42.712
Identification of the victim...
a white male around 30 years old...

01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:45.081
is pending notification of next of kin.

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:48.818
A witness I spoke to described
hearing the sound of a struggle...

01:17:48.898 --> 01:17:52.277
emanating from Room 612
around 4:00 this morning.

01:17:57.641 --> 01:17:59.462
Atherton Hotel.

01:17:59.542 --> 01:18:03.500
Sam Rawson's room, please. Room 612.

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:06.803
I'm sorry. There's been an accident.

01:18:06.883 --> 01:18:09.022
I think you should speak with...

01:19:03.606 --> 01:19:05.950
What are you doing down there?

01:19:12.949 --> 01:19:15.038
I just suddenly felt sick.

01:19:15.118 --> 01:19:17.207
It was the funniest thing.

01:19:17.287 --> 01:19:19.858
I hope I'm not pregnant.

01:19:21.091 --> 01:19:23.913
- Let me help you.
- I'm fine.

01:19:23.993 --> 01:19:25.939
Let me get you some water.

01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:29.252
Hey.

01:19:29.332 --> 01:19:30.936
Drink some.

01:19:37.807 --> 01:19:39.963
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

01:19:40.043 --> 01:19:42.632
I'm going out for a while.
I'm much better now.

01:19:42.712 --> 01:19:44.601
I thought you said breakfast.

01:19:44.681 --> 01:19:47.737
It's in the blender. I gotta go.

01:19:47.817 --> 01:19:49.592
Dressed like that?

01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:55.545
Well, I'm just gonna go upstairs
and see Graham.

01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:57.605
He called while you were out.

01:20:02.132 --> 01:20:06.489
Well, still, if you're not feeling well...

01:20:06.569 --> 01:20:08.571
you should wear more than that.

01:20:13.576 --> 01:20:15.249
Maybe you're right.

01:20:19.149 --> 01:20:21.720
Leave the door open so we can talk.

01:20:34.431 --> 01:20:36.707
You know why I think you're sick?

01:20:40.069 --> 01:20:42.015
You're upset about Sam.

01:20:52.582 --> 01:20:54.528
You know Sam's dead, don't you?

01:20:57.787 --> 01:21:00.131
Yeah. We don't have much lime.

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:08.003
You didn't do it, Hedy, did you?

01:21:10.633 --> 01:21:12.635
You couldn't have!

01:21:14.737 --> 01:21:16.341
Why?

01:21:21.711 --> 01:21:24.801
He came in my mouth and then tried
to beat the shit out of me...

01:21:24.881 --> 01:21:26.656
because I wanted to tell you.

01:21:28.718 --> 01:21:31.699
You know, it was an accident.

01:21:36.359 --> 01:21:37.963
But...

01:21:38.795 --> 01:21:40.399
he deserved it.

01:21:44.667 --> 01:21:46.489
Come on.

01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:48.515
The police will be here soon.

01:21:49.506 --> 01:21:50.951
But...

01:21:52.342 --> 01:21:54.288
But you shouldn't run.

01:21:56.546 --> 01:21:58.992
It'll only make it worse.

01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:02.423
I know you weren't yourself
when you did this.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.898
I know. I was you.

01:22:08.258 --> 01:22:10.329
Who is this Hedy, anyway?

01:22:12.529 --> 01:22:14.684
No one's seen her.

01:22:14.764 --> 01:22:16.573
She's not on the lease.

01:22:17.967 --> 01:22:20.914
There's not even a fingerprint of hers here.

01:22:21.704 --> 01:22:23.650
I've been cleaning like crazy.

01:22:28.411 --> 01:22:31.801
You have to come with me, Allie,
or they'll put you away.

01:22:31.881 --> 01:22:34.170
It'll never work!

01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:35.888
Besides...

01:22:36.653 --> 01:22:38.326
people have seen you.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:42.712
Just calm down.
We'll call a lawyer or a doctor...

01:22:42.792 --> 01:22:45.500
and they'll explain it to the police.

01:22:56.973 --> 01:22:59.010
Why are you making me do this?

01:23:01.844 --> 01:23:03.900
We're friends...

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:06.756
and you could be
in a lot of trouble without me.

01:23:08.885 --> 01:23:11.024
But I'm not gonna leave you.

01:23:12.855 --> 01:23:14.744
That wouldn't be right.

01:23:14.824 --> 01:23:16.713
I won't leave you.

01:23:16.793 --> 01:23:18.548
Okay, let's go.

01:23:18.628 --> 01:23:20.403
Come on. Up.

01:23:22.398 --> 01:23:24.687
Let's go. Go.

01:23:24.767 --> 01:23:26.371
Come on.

01:23:28.071 --> 01:23:29.675
Come on.

01:23:31.774 --> 01:23:33.796
No, no, no. Up to Graham's. Come on.

01:23:33.876 --> 01:23:36.065
Let's not involve Graham. Let's just leave.

01:23:36.145 --> 01:23:37.681
He's already involved.

01:23:49.659 --> 01:23:51.948
- Nobody's home.
- Use these.

01:23:52.028 --> 01:23:54.975
Come on. Go on. Hurry up. Go! Go!

01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.422
He must be sleeping.

01:23:59.502 --> 01:24:01.448
We were up late last night.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.815
He can't hear you.

01:24:11.648 --> 01:24:13.685
Wait'll you see me.

01:24:16.919 --> 01:24:21.800
Your color was beautiful, but I can't go
around looking like you anymore, can I?

01:24:22.525 --> 01:24:25.938
Okay, now, Allie, don't laugh.

01:24:28.598 --> 01:24:29.872
Ta-da!

01:24:36.673 --> 01:24:41.397
- Five years ago, these creatures...
- How's that? Good?

01:24:41.477 --> 01:24:44.934
23 and 24 are the movie channels.

01:24:45.014 --> 01:24:46.869
I gotta cash a paycheck.

01:24:46.949 --> 01:24:50.273
So, I'll only be gone an hour.
I know how you hate to be alone.

01:24:50.353 --> 01:24:52.308
Okay, are you good? Are you comfortable?

01:24:52.388 --> 01:24:53.992
All right.

01:24:55.825 --> 01:24:57.270
So...

01:24:58.294 --> 01:25:00.683
Well, when I get back,
we'll do your hair too.

01:25:00.763 --> 01:25:03.334
Okay? Be good. Bye.

01:25:58.488 --> 01:26:00.510
What's the part this time?

01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:03.696
- Excuse me?
- You're an actress, right?

01:26:05.061 --> 01:26:07.717
- You're never the same person twice.
- Oh.

01:26:07.797 --> 01:26:09.419
I like it.

01:26:09.499 --> 01:26:12.021
I just thought the other was more you.

01:26:12.101 --> 01:26:15.458
Well, maybe next time I'll try blond.

01:26:15.538 --> 01:26:17.093
Really?

01:26:17.173 --> 01:26:18.628
I'm flattered. Thanks.

01:26:18.708 --> 01:26:20.663
- Miss Besch.
- Yes?

01:26:20.743 --> 01:26:22.865
A guy's been calling. Says he's your father.

01:26:22.945 --> 01:26:25.735
Might have to come to New York
if you don't call him.

01:26:25.815 --> 01:26:26.919
Miss Besch.

01:26:36.392 --> 01:26:37.336
Hey!

01:26:44.433 --> 01:26:46.344
Jerk!

01:27:06.522 --> 01:27:07.967
Hey!

01:27:10.226 --> 01:27:12.399
You live here?

01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:16.919
No, I'm just watching
the place for the weekend.

01:27:16.999 --> 01:27:20.089
It's on a timer. I was out. I'm sorry.

01:27:20.169 --> 01:27:24.049
- I have to register a complaint.
- Oh, please. I'll turn it off.

01:27:38.221 --> 01:27:39.996
How could you do that?

01:27:41.357 --> 01:27:44.213
Everything I've done I've done for you.

01:27:44.293 --> 01:27:46.432
The people you hated I hated.

01:27:50.333 --> 01:27:52.313
People like you don't care.

01:27:55.004 --> 01:27:57.860
You're just like that stupid girl in Tampa.

01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:01.581
She called my parents too,
told 'em all my secrets.

01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:05.926
You want to put me away, huh?

01:28:10.386 --> 01:28:12.175
I can't...

01:28:12.255 --> 01:28:15.845
I can't keep making excuses for you, Allie.

01:28:15.925 --> 01:28:17.529
I can't.

01:28:22.465 --> 01:28:23.910
Oh, God.

01:28:54.230 --> 01:28:56.005
What?

01:28:58.467 --> 01:28:59.912
Please.

01:29:08.611 --> 01:29:10.887
Don't make me leave you, Ellen.

01:29:47.116 --> 01:29:48.595
Shh.

01:29:49.285 --> 01:29:50.889
It's okay.

01:29:54.824 --> 01:29:57.270
We've got to get out of here now.

01:30:11.974 --> 01:30:14.363
Jesus. Mitch!

01:30:14.443 --> 01:30:16.423
- What?
- Get in here!

01:30:20.249 --> 01:30:21.853
What is it? What?

01:30:23.219 --> 01:30:24.941
Look.

01:30:25.021 --> 01:30:26.625
It's erasing.

01:30:29.859 --> 01:30:31.805
I didn't do anything.

01:30:33.162 --> 01:30:34.266
Shit.

01:30:37.533 --> 01:30:39.513
Hey!

01:30:43.939 --> 01:30:45.748
On mine too!

01:30:53.582 --> 01:30:57.340
"Contact Allison Jones within 24 hours,
or the rest of your data...

01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:59.342
will be irretrievably lost.

01:30:59.422 --> 01:31:03.393
This payment policing program is
in all Allison Jones software."

01:31:05.294 --> 01:31:06.830
Bitch!

01:31:08.397 --> 01:31:10.519
Should I plug this in the phone jack?

01:31:10.599 --> 01:31:12.188
Uh-huh.

01:31:12.268 --> 01:31:14.991
- Great.
- You can make reservations on this?

01:31:15.071 --> 01:31:16.826
Mm-hmm.

01:31:16.906 --> 01:31:18.494
You pay by credit card.

01:31:18.574 --> 01:31:20.329
Wow.

01:31:20.409 --> 01:31:22.365
L.A., right?

01:31:22.445 --> 01:31:23.933
Yeah.

01:31:24.013 --> 01:31:26.402
No answer at the first number.

01:31:26.482 --> 01:31:27.984
What's this note?

01:31:38.928 --> 01:31:40.549
Busy.

01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:43.405
You turn 'em off. You turn 'em all off!

01:31:53.776 --> 01:31:57.246
Things are gonna be different
in L.A. You'll see.

01:31:59.115 --> 01:32:01.904
- First class?
- Is it worth it?

01:32:01.984 --> 01:32:05.441
Well, we can use one of Grahams cards.

01:32:05.521 --> 01:32:08.377
I think I saw his wallet in the living room.

01:32:08.457 --> 01:32:10.746
Oh, me too. Okay.

01:32:10.826 --> 01:32:12.430
I'll go see.

01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:28.518
I can't find it.

01:32:30.479 --> 01:32:33.426
I know I saw it somewhere.
Maybe it's in the kitchen.

01:32:54.370 --> 01:32:55.974
It's going down.

01:33:08.150 --> 01:33:09.754
It's okay.

01:33:49.325 --> 01:33:50.980
Excuse me, miss?

01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:54.132
Is this 1203? Is Graham Knox at home?

01:33:56.899 --> 01:33:58.587
He's on a cruise.

01:33:58.667 --> 01:34:02.615
Actually, I'm looking for a woman.
Allison Jones. Do you know her?

01:34:03.505 --> 01:34:04.827
Who are you?

01:34:04.907 --> 01:34:06.695
Mitchell Myerson.

01:34:06.775 --> 01:34:08.846
She did a job for me.

01:34:12.615 --> 01:34:15.104
There's no one named Jones on this floor.

01:34:15.184 --> 01:34:17.506
Yeah, I know. I was just down
at her apartment.

01:34:17.586 --> 01:34:19.675
I did contact her here once.

01:34:19.755 --> 01:34:22.745
Well, I'm the only one here now...

01:34:22.825 --> 01:34:25.714
and I never met her.

01:34:25.794 --> 01:34:28.604
- If you'll excuse me.
- Oh, sorry. Let me get that.

01:34:31.834 --> 01:34:34.440
This is hers. You do know her.

01:34:42.978 --> 01:34:45.652
What the fuck is going on here?

01:34:49.652 --> 01:34:51.256
Be careful. She's crazy.

01:34:52.621 --> 01:34:55.033
- Get off her.
- What?

01:34:56.592 --> 01:34:59.348
You think she wants you touching her? Huh?

01:34:59.428 --> 01:35:00.702
Get off her!

01:35:02.965 --> 01:35:04.740
I hear you. I'm gettin' up.

01:35:15.744 --> 01:35:16.688
Hurry.

01:35:19.915 --> 01:35:23.590
- Where is she?
- Don't worry. I took care of her.

01:35:52.915 --> 01:35:55.919
I don't wanna try to be loved anymore.

01:35:57.619 --> 01:36:02.778
I don't wanna be scared anymore...

01:36:02.858 --> 01:36:05.314
or to kill anymore.

01:36:05.394 --> 01:36:08.017
I don't wanna kill anymore.

01:36:08.097 --> 01:36:12.554
I don't wanna be alone anymore.

01:36:12.634 --> 01:36:17.226
I don't wanna be anything anymore.

01:36:17.306 --> 01:36:21.897
I don't need a reason to kill myself.

01:36:21.977 --> 01:36:23.923
I need a reason not to.

01:36:25.681 --> 01:36:27.285
There isn't one.

01:36:32.221 --> 01:36:34.667
You wanna say anything special to anyone?

01:36:38.327 --> 01:36:41.536
Okay. Allison Jones. Go on.

01:36:50.773 --> 01:36:52.810
There.

01:36:56.278 --> 01:36:58.224
Now they'll know it was you.

01:37:01.283 --> 01:37:04.093
No one who knows me will believe
that I wrote that.

01:37:05.187 --> 01:37:07.133
I was never that scared.

01:37:11.293 --> 01:37:13.382
Not like that.

01:37:13.462 --> 01:37:15.237
Of course it's you.

01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:21.206
I never met anyone so scared of being alone.

01:37:24.773 --> 01:37:27.830
I saved you from that...

01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:29.753
but you don't care.

01:37:34.316 --> 01:37:39.775
Did you know that identical twins
are never really identical?

01:37:39.855 --> 01:37:42.563
There's always one who's prettier.

01:37:44.059 --> 01:37:47.438
And the one who's not does all the work.

01:37:49.998 --> 01:37:53.912
She used me, and then she left me.

01:37:56.104 --> 01:37:57.845
Just like you.

01:38:00.642 --> 01:38:02.644
Go on. Take them.

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:07.360
Come on, Allie. It's nicer this way.

01:38:42.651 --> 01:38:43.755
Please.

01:38:47.356 --> 01:38:52.396
I'm not like your sister.
Not anymore. I'm like you now.

01:39:00.168 --> 01:39:01.806
I'll kill you!

01:39:02.638 --> 01:39:04.584
Get off him!

01:39:10.312 --> 01:39:12.258
Graham, stay inside!

01:41:59.815 --> 01:42:02.819
Hey, here you are.

01:42:11.593 --> 01:42:13.732
Don't make me come get you.

01:42:19.267 --> 01:42:20.871
Come out now.

01:42:22.237 --> 01:42:23.841
Come on.

01:42:31.012 --> 01:42:32.650
Come on!

01:42:33.815 --> 01:42:36.471
Come out now!

01:42:36.551 --> 01:42:38.963
Allie, please!

01:42:41.022 --> 01:42:42.797
I'm scared.

01:42:43.892 --> 01:42:45.496
Where are you?

01:43:26.968 --> 01:43:29.346
Why are ya hiding from me?

01:43:33.875 --> 01:43:36.832
Think I can't find you? Huh?

01:43:36.912 --> 01:43:39.017
Your goddamn shirt
is stickin' outta the door.

01:44:24.426 --> 01:44:26.465
I cried the whole week of Sam's funeral.

01:44:28.864 --> 01:44:31.208
Graham says that won't bring him back.

01:44:32.767 --> 01:44:34.838
He says I have to start letting go.

01:44:36.137 --> 01:44:37.993
He's right.

01:44:38.073 --> 01:44:40.362
Hedy's parents said that for years...

01:44:40.442 --> 01:44:44.390
they tried to explain to her that
her sister's death wasn't her fault...

01:44:45.714 --> 01:44:48.524
but she never forgave herself for surviving.

01:44:49.885 --> 01:44:53.332
So, every day I try to forgive Hedy for Sam.

01:44:54.556 --> 01:44:57.412
Then I try to do what she couldn't...

01:44:57.492 --> 01:44:59.438
forgive myself.

01:45:01.162 --> 01:45:03.802
I know what can happen
to someone who doesn't.
