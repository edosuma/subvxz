(car engine grinding, not turning over)

00:23.976 --> 00:26.310
Bob, we're gonna miss the
beginning of the movie.

00:26.345 --> 00:28.112
Plus, I'm smuggling chocolate in my pants.

00:28.146 --> 00:30.097
We got to get there before it melts.

00:30.132 --> 00:31.599
I'm gonna get it. Just a sec.

00:31.633 --> 00:33.351
Ugh! Can you roll down
the windows back here?

00:33.385 --> 00:34.986
I'm starting to breathe in Tina's breath.

00:35.020 --> 00:36.721
I can't. They're broken.

00:36.755 --> 00:38.856
I think I forgot to
brush this morning. Did I?

00:38.890 --> 00:40.241
- (exhales loudly)
- Yeah. Yeah, you did.

00:40.275 --> 00:42.476
JIMMY: Hey, who am I?

00:42.511 --> 00:43.878
(imitates engine not starting)

00:43.912 --> 00:45.279
(clicks tongue rhythmically)

00:45.313 --> 00:46.697
I'm Bob's car!

00:46.732 --> 00:47.982
(laughter) Good one, J.P.

00:48.033 --> 00:49.450
Uh, not a good one, Jimmy.

00:49.484 --> 00:50.818
(engine starts, Bob laughs)

00:50.852 --> 00:52.153
Started right up.

00:52.204 --> 00:53.637
- They went inside, Dad.
- Oh.

00:53.672 --> 00:55.856
Ugh! Start driving! Gene
just took off his shoes!

00:55.891 --> 00:57.575
And my socks!

00:57.609 --> 00:59.794
LOUISE: Why don't you wash your children?

00:59.828 --> 01:02.513
(engine knocking, stalls)

01:02.547 --> 01:05.349
Oh, great. Can't I just take
my family to a stupid movie?

01:05.384 --> 01:08.169
<i>Dog Prom 3D is not a stupid movie!</i>

01:08.220 --> 01:10.471
Are we gonna just leave
our car there like that?

01:10.505 --> 01:12.723
That's what we're gonna do
when Dad and Mom break down.

01:12.758 --> 01:14.341
Leave them by the side of the road!

01:14.393 --> 01:16.510
Hey, guys, you want to
see a live TV show taping?

01:16.561 --> 01:18.029
- Do I!
- Give me that.

01:18.063 --> 01:20.164
<i>"Come to a taping of Family Fracas."</i>

01:20.198 --> 01:22.316
<i>What's Family Fracas?</i>

01:22.350 --> 01:24.735
It's a game show where they
make families do weird stuff

01:24.770 --> 01:26.237
and then dump foam all over them.

01:26.271 --> 01:28.339
I'm into weird stuff and foam. Can we go?

01:28.373 --> 01:30.341
We should go home and call a tow truck.

01:30.375 --> 01:31.909
The car's not going anywhere, Bobby.

01:31.943 --> 01:33.377
Come on, it'll be fun.

01:33.412 --> 01:34.779
Please, Dad?

01:34.813 --> 01:36.580
- Please, Dad!
- Come on!

01:36.615 --> 01:37.981
- Come on, come on. Come on.
- KIDS: Please!

01:37.999 --> 01:39.784
Please!

01:42.954 --> 01:44.288
<i>Oh, look! Pam's Court!</i>

01:44.322 --> 01:46.557
I love the way she bangs that gavel. Bang!

01:46.591 --> 01:49.160
- Aah!- Hey, isn't that
Pam's ex-husband Chuck?

01:49.194 --> 01:50.127
Oh, my God.

01:50.162 --> 01:51.345
- What's he doing here?
- Aah!

01:51.379 --> 01:53.180
- Oh, hey, Chuck.
- Hello, Belchers.

01:53.215 --> 01:55.933
Long time no see since you got
my show canceled and me fired.

01:58.120 --> 01:59.854
A boobity boobity boobity boo!

01:59.888 --> 02:02.089
- Linda, nice to see you dressed again.
- Thank you.

02:02.124 --> 02:03.557
Yeah. Sorry about that. It... 

02:03.592 --> 02:05.626
(laughs) Water under the bridge, Bob.

02:05.660 --> 02:07.611
- Oh, good.
- Dark, dirty water.

02:07.646 --> 02:09.646
- Under a horrible bridge.
- Um...

02:09.681 --> 02:11.382
Oh, but all is well now.

02:11.416 --> 02:12.883
<i>You're looking at the
new host of Family Fracas!</i>

02:12.918 --> 02:14.485
Chuck, we got a problem.

02:14.519 --> 02:16.287
- The Morgan family just dropped out of the show.
- Aah.

02:16.321 --> 02:18.122
Food poisoning. Gross!

02:18.156 --> 02:20.291
We got to find another family
of five in the next ten minutes.

02:20.325 --> 02:21.725
But how the heck are we gonna do that?

02:21.760 --> 02:23.294
The heck right here.

02:23.328 --> 02:24.762
Yeah! We're a family of five.

02:24.796 --> 02:26.964
No, we're not. One, two, three, four.

02:26.998 --> 02:28.432
Oh, yes we are!

02:28.467 --> 02:29.834
Harry, this is a bad idea.

02:29.868 --> 02:31.268
<i>No idea's a bad idea.</i>

02:31.303 --> 02:32.670
I like this guy!

02:32.704 --> 02:33.938
I... I don't know.

02:33.972 --> 02:35.656
Grand prize is a brand-new minivan.

02:35.690 --> 02:36.791
Oh! Wh... whoa!

02:36.825 --> 02:38.125
Dad, this is a no-brainer.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.894
- Dad, come on!
- No, no. No, no, no.

02:39.928 --> 02:41.295
Bobby! If we win the minivan,

02:41.329 --> 02:43.397
we can put the car out of its misery.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.416
No. What the hell. Let's do it!

02:45.450 --> 02:47.601
<i>- No!
- Fantastic! Hooray for Family Fracas!</i>

02:47.652 --> 02:51.405
<i>MALE ANNOUNCER: It's
time for Family Fracas!</i>

02:51.439 --> 02:53.941
<i>Here's your host... Chuck Charles!</i>

02:53.975 --> 02:55.776
(applause and cheering) Hiya, folks!

02:55.811 --> 02:57.745
- Western Med...
- Whoa. Is that Bob?

02:57.779 --> 03:00.981
Let's welcome back the reigning
champs, the O'Donnell family!

03:01.016 --> 03:04.718
And competing against the
O'Donnells are the Belchers.

03:04.753 --> 03:06.654
- Hi!
- Hi, Linda.

03:06.688 --> 03:08.155
<i>Look. Tina's on Family Fracas.</i>

03:08.190 --> 03:09.924
My cousin was gonna be on that show,

03:09.958 --> 03:12.293
but he didn't want to wear
that outfit. I don't blame him.

03:12.327 --> 03:13.928
Belchers, introduce yourselves.

03:13.962 --> 03:15.963
Uh, well, I'm Bob, and
this is my wife Linda.

03:15.997 --> 03:17.331
Don't look at my hair.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.833
I didn't know I was gonna be on TV.

03:18.867 --> 03:20.434
And this is my daughter Louise.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.303
It's Louise! * And she is gonna win. *

03:22.337 --> 03:23.671
Okay, okay, okeydoke. And that one.

03:23.705 --> 03:25.139
That's Gene.

03:25.173 --> 03:26.540
Camera, take the day off!

03:26.575 --> 03:27.975
I added ten pounds to myself!

03:28.009 --> 03:29.443
And the last one's Tina.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.679
Hi. I'm Tina. I like
horses, music and boys.

03:31.713 --> 03:33.881
(whispering): Hi, boys. I'm Tina.

03:33.915 --> 03:35.382
Okay, that's more than enough.

03:35.417 --> 03:36.784
All right, let's get Frackin'!

03:36.818 --> 03:38.452
It's time for the Brain Drain!

03:38.486 --> 03:40.654
Well, it looks like these
guys have lost their marbles.

03:40.689 --> 03:42.022
The first team to fill their brain

03:42.057 --> 03:43.457
with these wins the challenge.

03:43.491 --> 03:44.925
And what does the other team get?

03:44.960 --> 03:45.993
ALL: Foamed!

03:46.027 --> 03:47.328
That's right... foamed.

03:47.362 --> 03:50.865
On your mark, get set, go!

03:50.899 --> 03:53.667
(gasps) Are you trying to
distract me by holding my hand?

03:53.702 --> 03:55.135
Huh, what? Owen, I feel it, too.

03:55.170 --> 03:56.804
But right now, we're competitors.

03:56.838 --> 03:59.173
I can't be sweet on you
before I beat on you.

03:59.207 --> 04:00.574
Tina, marble me!

04:00.609 --> 04:01.976
Oh, right.

04:02.010 --> 04:03.244
Done!

04:03.278 --> 04:05.813
(buzzer sounds, Tina and Gene groan)

04:05.847 --> 04:06.814
(applause and cheering)

04:06.848 --> 04:08.382
I ate it! I ate it!

04:08.416 --> 04:10.317
Num, num, num. I like it!

04:10.352 --> 04:13.187
First team to remove all the
flies from their soup wins.

04:13.221 --> 04:15.155
Losing team gets... face full of foam!

04:15.190 --> 04:17.391
- All right, Mom, you ready? You pumped?
- Yeah!

04:17.425 --> 04:18.759
- Slap my face!
- What?

04:18.793 --> 04:20.060
- Slap it!
- Oh, uh...

04:20.095 --> 04:21.995
I'll slap yours.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.530
Oh, uh, I'm pumped! I'm pumped!

04:23.565 --> 04:26.100
And... go!

04:26.134 --> 04:27.434
(groaning)

04:27.469 --> 04:29.403
- Done!
- Aha!

04:29.437 --> 04:30.905
Yeah! Foam time!

04:30.939 --> 04:32.873
(buzzer sounds)

04:32.908 --> 04:34.708
The Belchers and the O'Donnells are tied.

04:34.743 --> 04:37.044
Whoever wins the Human Claw
challenge wins the whole game.

04:37.078 --> 04:38.245
(applause and cheering)

04:38.280 --> 04:39.780
I can smell that minivan.

04:39.814 --> 04:41.715
I call shotgun! I call optional third row.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.617
<i>Ugh! The whole third row.</i>

04:43.652 --> 04:45.085
Children, shut up, shut up, shut up!

04:45.120 --> 04:46.620
And Bob and Pat are gonna get dunked

04:46.655 --> 04:48.055
into a pit full of blue balls.

04:48.089 --> 04:50.024
The first one to find a yellow ball wins.

04:50.058 --> 04:52.793
But they have to grab
the ball with their teeth.

04:52.827 --> 04:55.396
Families, you control the crane.
No crane, no gain, am I right?

04:55.430 --> 04:56.897
(bell dings) I am right!

04:56.932 --> 04:58.132
(laughter)

04:58.166 --> 04:59.233
My harness is a little tight

04:59.267 --> 05:00.200
- around the groin...
- Go!

05:00.235 --> 05:03.037
Aah! (Bob groans)

05:03.071 --> 05:05.773
(applause and cheering)

05:05.807 --> 05:08.042
Come on, Dad! Make us proud for once!

05:08.109 --> 05:10.177
(bell dinging) I got one! I got one!

05:10.211 --> 05:12.880
Dad won! Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha!

05:12.914 --> 05:14.381
Well, bash my head in with a brick.

05:14.416 --> 05:15.749
The Belchers won.

05:15.784 --> 05:17.251
- We won! We won!
- Yah!

05:17.285 --> 05:18.786
- Yes! Yay!
- All right!

05:18.820 --> 05:19.753
Yay, Bobby!

05:19.788 --> 05:21.155
Wow, Tina won.

05:21.189 --> 05:23.891
(speaking gibberish) Honk, honk, honk!

05:23.925 --> 05:26.493
O'Donnells, we are really
sorry to see you go.

05:26.528 --> 05:27.528
You are good people.

05:27.562 --> 05:29.229
Bye, Joey and Owen!

05:29.264 --> 05:30.631
You're leaving in shame,
but you played a good game.

05:30.665 --> 05:32.266
(whispering): They were terrible.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.601
And now the Belchers are
gonna spin the prize wheel

05:34.636 --> 05:36.804
for a chance to win a brand-new minivan!

05:36.838 --> 05:38.939
(audience sighs and gasps)

05:38.974 --> 05:40.908
I got this. (groans)

05:40.942 --> 05:44.144
Come on, come on, come on, minivan.

05:44.179 --> 05:46.080
Oh, hey, a five-gallon
bucket of Fracas foam,

05:46.114 --> 05:47.948
so you can get foamed at home.

05:47.983 --> 05:49.483
Home foam! No!

05:49.517 --> 05:51.452
Yes! It tastes good. Trust me.

05:51.486 --> 05:53.387
The Belchers will return
tomorrow as the champs

05:53.421 --> 05:55.255
and have another shot at the minivan.

05:55.290 --> 05:56.757
Hey! We're coming back!

05:56.791 --> 05:58.158
That's exactly what I just said.

05:58.193 --> 05:59.526
Put your hands together
for the winning family!

05:59.561 --> 06:00.928
- (applause and cheering)
- You hear that?

06:00.962 --> 06:02.363
We're the winning family!

06:02.397 --> 06:03.764
Yes, they all hear that!
I have a microphone.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.199
Congratulations to the most annoying

06:05.233 --> 06:06.867
<i>winning family in Fracas history.</i>

06:06.901 --> 06:09.370
- We won most annoying! Yeah!
- Hi, Ma!

06:13.195 --> 06:15.963
You guys, this is so much
better than the minivan.

06:15.998 --> 06:17.365
Mmm.

06:17.399 --> 06:19.067
Gene, stop eating that crap.

06:19.101 --> 06:22.103
You're just jealous that
I have frothy diarrhea.

06:22.137 --> 06:23.571
Come on, you big idiot.

06:23.605 --> 06:25.840
(whistling) * La, la, la... 

06:25.874 --> 06:29.277
<i>Hey, Jimmy, did you happen to
catch Family Fracas last night?</i>

06:29.311 --> 06:30.912
'Cause we were on it, and we won.

06:30.946 --> 06:32.280
Oh yeah, is that the show

06:32.314 --> 06:34.515
where the most pathetic family wins?

06:34.550 --> 06:36.417
(laughing) No, no. No, it isn't, Jimmy.

06:36.452 --> 06:38.453
Why don't you watch it tonight?
I'll send you a shout out.

06:38.487 --> 06:40.288
Oh, yeah, why don't you watch this?

06:40.322 --> 06:42.490
Hey, I'm Bob! I'm on a
game show! Blah, blah, blah!

06:42.524 --> 06:44.926
I... I don't want to watch that.
I'm gonna change the channel

06:44.960 --> 06:46.828
with my remote that I have. Click!

06:46.862 --> 06:48.796
- I'm still Bob, and I'm still on...
- Wait, wait, wait. Click.

06:48.831 --> 06:50.264
This channel. I just shut
you off! I just shut you off... 

06:50.299 --> 06:51.666
- And I'm on that.
- So you can't say anything!

06:51.700 --> 06:53.167
Now I'm on shut off
channel. I shut you off!

06:53.202 --> 06:55.269
Belchers, meet your
competition... the Changs.

06:55.304 --> 06:56.504
Hey. Everybody Chang sons tonight.

06:56.538 --> 06:58.873
Oh, dear lord.

06:58.907 --> 07:00.308
Oh, my gosh, there's Pam!

07:00.342 --> 07:02.777
Hi, Pam! I mean, Your Honor.

07:02.811 --> 07:06.013
Chuck. I see you're working
with these nice folks again.

07:06.048 --> 07:07.448
How fun for you!

07:07.483 --> 07:08.783
Well, I have to get to court.

07:08.817 --> 07:10.318
♪ You're not a real judge. ♪

07:10.385 --> 07:12.653
♪ If anyone needs me,
I'll be in my chambers. ♪

07:12.688 --> 07:15.189
♪ It's not chambers.
It's a dressing room! ♪

07:15.224 --> 07:17.391
I sentence you to kiss my
ass! See this right here?

07:17.426 --> 07:18.993
- That's your punishment!
- Oh, wouldn't you... ? Oh, you would love it.

07:19.027 --> 07:20.194
- Oh, you would love it.
- You can just kiss it.

07:20.229 --> 07:22.163
Oh, I will do it.

07:22.197 --> 07:23.631
Somebody better kiss somebody's
ass, or I'm gonna go crazy.

07:23.665 --> 07:25.032
Belchers and Changs are tied.

07:25.067 --> 07:26.634
Whoever wins the Human Claw takes the game.

07:26.668 --> 07:28.035
Good luck, Changs! And Belchers.

07:28.070 --> 07:30.438
But mostly Changs.

07:30.472 --> 07:31.772
(applause and cheering) And go!

07:33.909 --> 07:36.544
Yeah, Dad,

07:36.578 --> 07:37.645
grab those balls!

07:37.679 --> 07:39.480
- LINDA: Yeah!
- I got one!

07:39.515 --> 07:40.882
(bell dinging) Oh! So sorry, Joe.

07:40.916 --> 07:43.117
Bob's little rat snout
found the ball first,

07:43.152 --> 07:44.752
which means the Belchers win!

07:44.786 --> 07:46.187
(whooping) All right!

07:46.221 --> 07:47.455
Did you just say rat snout?

07:47.489 --> 07:49.157
Let me at that wheel!

07:49.191 --> 07:51.325
(applause and cheering)

07:51.360 --> 07:54.529
Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay!

07:54.563 --> 07:57.064
(audience groans)

07:57.099 --> 07:58.633
Foam again?!

07:58.667 --> 08:00.568
Uh, Chuck, can I give someone a shout out?

08:00.602 --> 08:02.370
- Absolutely not.
- Jimmy Pesto's an idiot! The end.

08:02.404 --> 08:03.871
Tough shout out. Hmm.

08:03.906 --> 08:05.540
Thanks for sharing, Bob. So
glad you guys are coming back.

08:05.574 --> 08:06.774
If I could just mention
my restaurant, Bob's...

Harry, please, please, please
kick the Belchers off the show.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.613
You've asked me that every night this week.

08:43.647 --> 08:45.448
- And what do I say?
- You say,

08:45.483 --> 08:47.450
"Watch this," and then, you
do that thing with your hands.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.785
That's right, Chuck. Watch this.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.253
- Oh, oh. Oh, yeah.
- Oh, whoa.

08:50.287 --> 08:51.721
- Oh, oh, rounder.
- Oh, oh, oh.

08:51.756 --> 08:53.089
Whoa! Where we going? Opposites.

08:53.124 --> 08:54.924
(laughter) Yup.

08:54.959 --> 08:56.593
- Here comes a hand.
- Ah, that's how you get me!

08:56.627 --> 08:57.961
You said they could be on one episode,

08:57.995 --> 08:59.396
but they keep coming back again and again.

08:59.430 --> 09:01.798
Look, it's part of the job.

09:01.832 --> 09:04.501
<i>Richard Dawson used to kiss
all the women on Family Feud.</i>

09:04.535 --> 09:06.102
He didn't pick and choose.
He just puckered up.

09:06.137 --> 09:07.987
Pucker up, Chuck.

09:08.022 --> 09:10.423
- No, seriously, pucker up.
- Hmm. Hmm?

09:10.458 --> 09:11.991
Okay, come here. Practice on me.

09:12.026 --> 09:14.694
- I'm Dawson, you're me. Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

09:14.729 --> 09:16.279
- <i>You're Dawson, I'm me.
- Okay. Mm-hmm.</i>

09:16.313 --> 09:18.114
- Yeah, just like that.
- Okay.

09:18.149 --> 09:19.499
- Now we're both Dawson. Double Dawson.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

09:19.533 --> 09:20.967
Mmm, mmm, mmm. Okay.

09:21.001 --> 09:22.302
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

09:22.336 --> 09:23.837
- Okay, are we good?
- One more.

09:23.871 --> 09:26.172
Maybe someone else should
spin the prize wheel tonight

09:26.207 --> 09:27.807
since Louise keeps landing on foam.

09:27.842 --> 09:31.911
<i>Ooh! I thought you wanted
five big buckets of foam!</i>

09:31.929 --> 09:35.265
- No.
- I wish you would have told me sooner, Tina!

09:35.299 --> 09:37.667
Don't worry. We'll beat the
other family like we always do.

09:37.701 --> 09:40.036
And tonight, we win the van. I feel it.

09:40.070 --> 09:42.272
JIMMY: You're gonna feel
your butt being spanked.

09:42.306 --> 09:44.407
That's what you're gonna feel.

09:44.442 --> 09:46.209
<i>Jimmy?! You're on Family Fracas?</i>

09:46.243 --> 09:48.945
Yup. I signed us up. Get ready to lose.

09:48.979 --> 09:51.281
I only count four Pestos
and your bartender Trev.

09:51.315 --> 09:54.050
I told them he was the son I always wanted.

09:54.084 --> 09:55.835
- What?
- Right on, Pops. Ha!

09:55.870 --> 09:57.887
(laughing): Oh, I see you guys have met.

09:57.922 --> 09:59.088
Jimmy, you should just leave right now,

09:59.123 --> 10:00.356
because we're unbeatable.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.858
Jimmy Pesto!

10:01.892 --> 10:03.626
Oh, you're the guy Bob
called an idiot on the air.

10:03.661 --> 10:05.128
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

10:05.090 --> 10:07.225
Hmm. You hate Bob, I hate Bob. I like you.

10:07.259 --> 10:08.993
Jimmy Jr., you and I are friends

10:09.027 --> 10:11.429
and have been more than friends
on one and a half occasions.

10:11.463 --> 10:12.830
If you say so.

10:12.865 --> 10:14.265
But tonight, we're competitors.

10:14.299 --> 10:15.783
I have to put aside my feelings for you.

10:15.818 --> 10:17.135
And destroy you.

10:17.169 --> 10:18.836
Whoa. You're being kind of intense, Tina.

10:18.871 --> 10:20.405
I know. I bring it.

10:20.439 --> 10:22.306
And... go!

10:22.341 --> 10:23.958
(applause and cheering)

10:23.992 --> 10:25.743
Come on Gene and Tina! Brush!

10:25.778 --> 10:27.278
Tiny circles! Tiny circles!

10:27.312 --> 10:28.946
Come on, Jay Ju!

10:28.997 --> 10:31.015
I can't believe you made
me care about this. Come on!

10:31.049 --> 10:31.983
(breathing heavily)

10:32.017 --> 10:33.117
Do it, Jimmy! Go!

10:33.152 --> 10:35.520
Hey, Jimmy Jr., you missed a spot.

10:35.554 --> 10:37.155
- On your face.
- Quit it, Tina!

10:37.189 --> 10:38.189
GENE: T!

10:38.223 --> 10:39.257
Pick up the pace!

10:39.324 --> 10:40.324
(grunting)

10:40.359 --> 10:41.259
Brush, brush, brush, brush!

10:41.293 --> 10:41.976
Done!

10:42.010 --> 10:43.044
(buzzer sounds)

10:43.078 --> 10:44.595
(both shout)

10:44.630 --> 10:47.098
Damn it! (laughs)

10:47.132 --> 10:48.182
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:48.217 --> 10:49.300
Whoa. (grunts)

10:49.351 --> 10:51.319
(grunts) You hit my eye!

10:51.353 --> 10:53.354
Here. Now we're twins again!

10:53.388 --> 10:55.139
- Done!
- (groans) Yes!

10:55.190 --> 10:56.808
(both shout)

10:56.842 --> 10:58.376
Oh, what's the point of
having twins if they can't

10:58.410 --> 11:00.461
hit each other with eggs
like they were supposed to?

11:00.496 --> 11:02.263
The Belchers and Pestos are neck and neck.

11:02.297 --> 11:04.832
It's anybody's game as we
head into the Human Claw!

11:04.867 --> 11:06.334
Have fun losing, Jimmy.

11:06.368 --> 11:07.635
(mocking sounds)

11:07.669 --> 11:08.970
Well said, Jimmy.

11:09.004 --> 11:11.172
Ready, set, grab that ball!

11:11.206 --> 11:12.673
(grunts) (audience cheering)

11:12.708 --> 11:14.842
- We have a winner!
- Huh?

11:14.877 --> 11:16.144
GENE/TINA/LOUISE: No!

11:16.178 --> 11:17.311
What just happened?

11:17.346 --> 11:19.347
We lost to the Pestos. (sighs)

11:19.381 --> 11:20.681
We had a good run.

11:20.716 --> 11:22.416
And that's from a kid who hates running.

11:22.451 --> 11:24.852
(laughing) I'm so sorry, Bob.

11:24.887 --> 11:28.673
<i>The Pestos are the new
champs of Family Fracas!</i>

11:28.724 --> 11:30.725
(Pestos cheering)

11:32.678 --> 11:34.679
Uh, can you lower me down now?

11:34.713 --> 11:36.881
We're trying! It's stuck, Bobby!

11:36.915 --> 11:38.699
Chuck, the crane is stuck.

11:38.734 --> 11:39.884
Bob, just a second. (laughs)

11:39.918 --> 11:42.520
And the Pestos win a brand-new minivan!

11:42.571 --> 11:43.905
Oh!

11:43.939 --> 11:45.573
- TREV: Oh! Oh!
- JIMMY: Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

11:45.607 --> 11:47.241
- Pull!
- Kids, stop.

11:47.276 --> 11:48.843
Don't do that. Stop!

11:48.877 --> 11:50.178
No, no, no!

11:50.212 --> 11:51.679
(all gasp)

11:51.713 --> 11:53.247
- GENE: Oh, boy.
- LOUISE: Oh, Dad.

11:53.282 --> 11:54.749
Oh! Ew!

11:54.783 --> 11:56.551
(laughter)

11:56.585 --> 11:58.286
CHUCK: Oh, that's too bad.

11:58.320 --> 12:01.789
<i>Let's give the Belchers a
big Family Fracas bye-bye!</i>

12:01.824 --> 12:03.891
AUDIENCE: Bye-bye, Belchers!

12:03.926 --> 12:05.843
Bye! What? I'm saying good-bye.

12:09.281 --> 12:11.582
I know what you're all thinking...
not only did we lose to the Pestos

12:11.617 --> 12:13.184
but I also humiliated myself.

12:13.218 --> 12:14.685
Correct. I was thinking that.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.320
Well, you're right. I blew it.

12:16.355 --> 12:18.489
At least we have all this stupid foam.

12:18.523 --> 12:21.259
Aw, Bobby. I'm gonna get
rid of this Fracas foam.

12:21.293 --> 12:23.527
I'm gonna flush it down the toilet. Bye.

12:23.562 --> 12:24.629
No! You can't!

12:24.663 --> 12:25.630
It's true. It says right there

12:25.664 --> 12:26.931
- you can't.
- Oh.

12:26.965 --> 12:28.332
Hey, Dad, want a little good news?

12:28.367 --> 12:29.667
You're about to go viral.

12:29.701 --> 12:30.868
Stop! (audience gasps)

12:30.903 --> 12:32.169
CHUCK: Oh, that's too bad.

12:32.204 --> 12:34.805
(laughs) His pants come off every time.

12:34.840 --> 12:37.642
Thanks a lot, guys. Thanks
for helping me get past this.

12:37.676 --> 12:39.043
No problem.

12:39.077 --> 12:41.545
How did Jimmy find that
ball in two seconds?

12:41.580 --> 12:42.530
It's almost impossible.

12:42.581 --> 12:44.165
Bob, stop obsessing.

12:44.199 --> 12:46.167
- It's over.
- (groans)

12:46.201 --> 12:48.836
This is the fifth time
he's circled the block.

12:48.870 --> 12:51.772
Jimmy, I get it. You won the minivan.

12:51.807 --> 12:53.608
Face it, Bob. You were destined to lose.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.376
I knew it, Chuck sure knew it.

12:55.410 --> 12:57.645
Wh... what do you mean, "Chuck
sure knew it"? What does that mean?

12:57.679 --> 12:59.480
What? Nothing. I... I have a disease

12:59.514 --> 13:02.266
where I say things, you know,
and it makes me drive away... 

13:03.769 --> 13:05.720
Hmm.

13:05.771 --> 13:07.738
(audience cheering)

13:07.773 --> 13:09.774
We have a w... 

13:11.209 --> 13:13.177
We have a w... 

13:13.211 --> 13:16.163
Dad, if you watch the video in
reverse your pants go back on.

13:16.198 --> 13:17.999
Thanks, Louise. I'm just watching Jimmy.

13:18.033 --> 13:20.067
It's like he knew exactly
where to find the yellow ball.

13:20.102 --> 13:22.203
And I have a hunch Chuck
told him where to look.

13:22.237 --> 13:23.404
Watch.

13:23.438 --> 13:25.406
(audience cheering)

13:25.440 --> 13:26.874
- We...
- Did you see that?

13:26.908 --> 13:29.210
Yeah. Wait, what was I supposed to see?

13:29.244 --> 13:31.245
He barely fished for it. He cheated.

13:31.279 --> 13:33.581
We were wronged. Look,
there are a lot of things

13:33.632 --> 13:35.599
- this family's terrible at.
- That's true.

13:35.634 --> 13:37.852
<i>We were really good at Family Fracas.</i>

13:37.886 --> 13:39.987
And if we're gonna lose, I
want to lose fair and square.

13:40.022 --> 13:42.156
Not because that jerk Pesto cheated.

13:42.190 --> 13:44.725
- Hey, Dad, can we put a pin in this? We're running late.
- For what?

13:44.760 --> 13:47.228
For the Pesto's minivan.
Jimmy Jr.'s having a screening

13:47.262 --> 13:48.863
<i>of Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights.</i>

13:48.897 --> 13:50.865
What? No! Didn't you hear what I just said?

13:50.899 --> 13:52.533
That's the van of a cheater!

13:52.567 --> 13:55.002
What are we supposed to
do, Dad? Watch the TV here?

13:55.037 --> 13:57.571
That thing makes me sick!
You know what I'm gonna do?

13:57.606 --> 13:59.173
I'm gonna drive down to the studio... 

13:59.207 --> 14:00.841
GENE: The car's broken, Dad!

14:00.876 --> 14:03.177
Damn it! I'm gonna walk to the studio

14:03.211 --> 14:05.579
and talk to those people face-to-face!

14:05.614 --> 14:07.848
You, you, not you

14:07.883 --> 14:10.418
- and you.
- Tina, what are you doing here?

14:10.452 --> 14:13.254
- We're here for the screening.
- Yeah, let us in. Let's do this. Come on.

14:13.288 --> 14:15.289
I don't know, Tina. You
said some pretty mean things

14:15.323 --> 14:17.725
<i>on Family Fracas yesterday.
We'll take that popcorn though.</i>

14:17.759 --> 14:19.794
- Thank you.
- Jimmy Jr., wait!

14:19.845 --> 14:21.078
What you saw before was my game face.

14:21.096 --> 14:23.197
This is my normal face.

14:23.231 --> 14:26.384
Let us in! Oh, you're getting
a banana in your tailpipe.

14:26.418 --> 14:29.387
- Oh...
- And I am not talking about the van.

14:29.421 --> 14:31.038
Oh!

14:31.073 --> 14:32.573
<i>BOB: I think Jimmy Pesto cheated</i>

14:32.607 --> 14:35.109
- at the Human Claw game.
- Hmm. You do?

14:35.143 --> 14:37.478
Yes, and I... I think
Chuck might've helped him.

14:37.512 --> 14:43.317
Hmm... 

14:43.351 --> 14:46.320
Um, what's happening right now?

14:46.354 --> 14:49.557
Here's the thing, Bob. I believe
you believe you were wronged.

14:49.591 --> 14:51.142
- Thank you?
- This is big.

14:51.176 --> 14:53.277
Yes. And I could make it a lot bigger.

14:53.311 --> 14:54.779
Yes! Wait, what do you mean?

14:54.813 --> 14:58.449
<i>I'm talking about Bob
versus Chuck on Pam's Court.</i>

14:58.483 --> 15:00.451
Um, no. I don't want to do that.

15:00.485 --> 15:03.320
How 'bout I just go to a
real court with real lawyers?

15:03.355 --> 15:05.523
That costs serious
dough. You don't have it.

15:05.557 --> 15:07.324
What makes you say that?

15:07.359 --> 15:08.826
Those stains, your smells,

15:08.860 --> 15:10.127
you walked here, your children,

15:10.162 --> 15:11.595
you're not wearing any jewelry.

15:11.630 --> 15:13.464
<i>Aw, crap. All right, Pam's Court.</i>

15:13.498 --> 15:14.698
- Let's do it.
- All right!

15:14.733 --> 15:15.699
Congratulations, Bob.

15:15.734 --> 15:17.134
The Belchers are back on TV!

15:17.169 --> 15:18.536
You know what that rhymes with?

15:18.570 --> 15:20.371
- Uh...
- Long Island Iced Tea.

15:20.405 --> 15:21.806
I'm gonna have one.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.624
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

15:23.658 --> 15:27.011
You have a bar in your desk?

15:27.045 --> 15:29.430
You don't have a bar in your desk?

15:29.464 --> 15:30.931
(slurping)

15:30.966 --> 15:34.268

16:03.671 --> 16:06.640
<i>This is the case of the Great Balls of Ire.</i>

16:06.674 --> 16:09.142
<i>All rise. Pam's Court is now in session.</i>

16:09.177 --> 16:12.562
You may be seated. So,
someone else besides me

16:12.597 --> 16:15.232
is accusing Chuck of cheating.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.566
Mr. Belcher, you claim

16:16.601 --> 16:17.934
that Chuck helped Jimmy Pesto

16:17.969 --> 16:19.770
<i>cheat at Family Fracas.</i>

16:19.804 --> 16:21.772
Uh, yes, Your Honor.
At the Human Claw game,

16:21.806 --> 16:23.774
which I happen to be pretty good at.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.676
Do you have any evidence
to support your claim?

16:25.710 --> 16:28.512
Uh, yes, I do, Your Honor.
Jimmy said Chuck, quote,

16:28.546 --> 16:30.414
"sure knew I was gonna lose."

16:30.448 --> 16:33.550
Now, I ask the court,
how was Chuck so sure?

16:33.584 --> 16:35.619
Mr. Pesto, did you say this?

16:35.653 --> 16:36.887
Yeah. I said it.

16:36.921 --> 16:38.388
Aha! So he admits it!

16:38.423 --> 16:39.623
Yeah, I admit that you lost.

16:39.657 --> 16:41.108
And no one was surprised.

16:41.142 --> 16:43.076
Your Honor, the prosecution
clearly has no case.

16:43.111 --> 16:45.512
I hate to agree with the defense,

16:45.546 --> 16:47.547
and also, I hate the defense

16:47.582 --> 16:49.549
and his smug face,

16:49.584 --> 16:51.418
and his misshapen penis.

16:51.452 --> 16:53.220
Ho-ho-ho-ho! Well, it pleased the court.

16:53.254 --> 16:54.788
The court was faking it.

16:54.822 --> 16:56.223
(laughs) I don't think so.

16:56.257 --> 16:57.391
- You shut up.
- No, you shut up.

16:57.425 --> 16:58.558
- Shut your mouth.
- Shut your mouth.

16:58.593 --> 16:59.426
I will jump over there,

16:59.460 --> 17:00.961
- and shut it for you.
- Edit that out.

17:00.995 --> 17:02.979
Do you have any other
evidence, Mr. Belcher?

17:03.014 --> 17:05.582
You bet he does! You got something, right?

17:05.616 --> 17:07.217
- Come on, give it to 'em.
- Actually, I... I don't.

17:07.251 --> 17:08.585
I... I... thought, uh... 

17:08.618 --> 17:09.819
that when I said that one thing

17:09.854 --> 17:11.088
he would just confess.

17:11.122 --> 17:12.723
Bobby, that's all you got?

17:12.757 --> 17:13.990
Quick! Let's call a surprise witness!

17:14.025 --> 17:15.242
Who?

17:15.276 --> 17:17.493
I call Henry Kissinger to the stand!

17:17.528 --> 17:19.829

17:28.706 --> 17:30.607
Jimmy cheated, Lin. I know it.

Hey, we're on TV.

17:32.026 --> 17:34.127
<i>We know, Tina. We're on Pam's Court.</i>

17:34.162 --> 17:36.163
Pretty neat, huh? It's a TV show.

17:36.197 --> 17:37.864
No, we're on that TV. Hi.

17:44.639 --> 17:46.973
Wait a sec. That's it! What?

17:47.008 --> 17:49.309
And we're back in three, two... 

17:49.343 --> 17:52.512
I went to my chambers
and reviewed this case.

17:52.547 --> 17:53.847
Objection! You did not!

17:53.881 --> 17:55.165
You were here.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.000
You were putting on makeup the whole time.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.635
You don't even need makeup, on.

17:58.669 --> 18:00.103
- Oh, thank you.
- LINDA: You're beautiful.

18:00.138 --> 18:01.838
- And that robe...
- PAM: You're wonderful.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.507
I'd love to see you without
makeup though to be honest.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.142
Moving on!

of Ire, I rule that... 

18:07.011 --> 18:08.278
BOB: Wait, Your Honor!

18:08.312 --> 18:10.714
I... I have new evidence.
I can prove my case.

18:10.748 --> 18:13.316
- Go on.
- These cameras, they're always rolling. Right?

18:13.351 --> 18:15.318
- Correct.
- A... and the same with the cameras

18:15.353 --> 18:16.887
<i>- on Family Fracas, right?
- Uh-oh.</i>

18:16.921 --> 18:18.388
One of those cameras

18:18.422 --> 18:20.323
may have caught Chuck helping Jimmy cheat.

18:20.358 --> 18:21.691
The Foam Cam!

18:21.693 --> 18:23.226
Dad, the Foam Cam is on the ceiling!

18:23.261 --> 18:25.295
I never forget a camera that feeds me.

18:25.329 --> 18:27.230
Objection! Objection!

18:27.265 --> 18:29.299
Hearsay! Inadmissible... hears-say... 

18:29.333 --> 18:30.534
Overruled!

18:30.568 --> 18:32.168
Bring me the Foam Cam tape.

18:32.186 --> 18:33.487
Does this mean we're gonna win?

18:33.521 --> 18:35.188
- I sure hope so, Tina.
- Good.

18:35.223 --> 18:36.990
Psst.

18:37.024 --> 18:38.992
Your ass is grass. And I'm gonna mow it.

18:39.026 --> 18:40.577

18:40.611 --> 18:42.412
Hey, so we... 

18:42.446 --> 18:43.713
can't show that tape.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.715
Oh, you did help Jimmy cheat.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.684
Shh! Yes. Yes! And I had
to get rid of the Belchers.

18:47.718 --> 18:49.019
You gave me no choice.

18:49.053 --> 18:50.320
I put the ball in Jimmy's mouth.

18:50.354 --> 18:51.905
You put it in your mouth

18:51.956 --> 18:53.807
- and then you kissed it into his mouth.
- What? No.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.175
I put it into his mouth with my hand.

18:55.209 --> 18:56.593
Huh. That's one way to do it.

18:56.627 --> 18:57.694
I'll take that.

18:57.712 --> 18:59.830
Ha! There's the evidence, idiot.

18:59.864 --> 19:01.147
Ha, you're the idiot.

19:01.182 --> 19:02.582
What do we do?

19:02.617 --> 19:04.150
I'm not gonna let the
host of one of my shows

19:04.185 --> 19:06.002
lose a trial on another one of my shows.

19:06.036 --> 19:08.037
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Whoops.

19:08.055 --> 19:09.322
Ah, Judge Pam, did you see that?

19:09.357 --> 19:10.340
Huh? See what?

19:10.374 --> 19:11.608
I saw it!

19:11.642 --> 19:12.876
The evidence must be on that tape.

19:12.910 --> 19:14.377
- Which means Dad was right.
- Yes!

19:14.412 --> 19:17.697
What is going on with my lighter right now?

19:17.732 --> 19:19.165
It's burning this tape.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.218
What the hell? He's burning the tape!

19:21.252 --> 19:22.886
Pam? You know what to do.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.721
Right.

19:24.755 --> 19:26.189
Without any actual evidence,

19:26.224 --> 19:28.859
I have to rule in favor of the defense.

19:28.893 --> 19:31.278
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah! Justice!

19:31.312 --> 19:32.562
(buzzer sounds)

19:32.580 --> 19:33.797
What's going on?

<i>- The losers get foamed on Pam's Court.
- That's insane.</i>

19:39.403 --> 19:41.354

their shows on this channel.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.193
(screams) Down you go.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.728
I will kick you in the jaw.

19:48.763 --> 19:50.297
- I will...
- Just put my hand on your throat,

19:50.348 --> 19:51.581
and down you go.

19:51.616 --> 19:53.216
What're we gonna do now?

19:53.251 --> 19:54.784
Nothing. We lost.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.536
- But Jimmy and Chuck cheated.
- Doesn't matter.

19:56.571 --> 19:57.938
We were never gonna win this case.

19:57.972 --> 19:59.306
This whole thing was fixed.

19:59.340 --> 20:00.774
Let's just go home and... 

20:00.808 --> 20:04.060
and never watch any
shows on Channel 13 again!

20:04.095 --> 20:06.129
- Oh come on, you don't mean that.
- Yes I do!

20:06.163 --> 20:07.814
<i>I might watch a little bit of Pam's Court.</i>

20:07.848 --> 20:09.215
Just a little bit.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.901
When are we getting the car back, Dad?

20:10.935 --> 20:12.135
I don't know.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.386
The mechanic called yesterday

20:13.421 --> 20:14.788
but I never called him back.

20:14.822 --> 20:16.439
I thought we were gonna win the minivan.

20:16.457 --> 20:18.491

20:20.294 --> 20:22.979

20:40.698 --> 20:42.115

- Yeah, but he was funny.

- No.
