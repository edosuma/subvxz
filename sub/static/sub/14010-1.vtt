<i>Bloody, half naked,
wandering the streets at 7:00 a.m.</i>

00:07.834 --> 00:08.500
<i>Just your type.</i>

00:08.502 --> 00:09.567
<i>All we found on her was this.</i>

00:09.568 --> 00:11.702
<i>"Hollis M.
Nye, Attorney-at-Law."</i>

00:11.904 --> 00:14.638
<i>I want to help you, Ellen,
'cause I know you didn't do it.</i>

00:14.640 --> 00:16.974
<i>I am Catherine's
legal guardian.</i>

00:16.976 --> 00:18.275
<i>To get custody, you're going to</i>

00:18.277 --> 00:20.611
<i>have to prove that I
perpetrated fraud.</i>

00:20.613 --> 00:22.713
<i>The fraud you
perpetrated was convincing the</i>

00:22.715 --> 00:23.947
<i>state you were a fit mother.</i>

00:23.949 --> 00:26.183
<i>We'll get you a
list of our witnesses.</i>

00:26.185 --> 00:28.152
<i>I thought about
you when you were gone.</i>

00:28.154 --> 00:32.923
<i>I'm not really in the...
best state of mind these days.</i>

00:32.925 --> 00:36.059
<i>Whenever you feel like
it-- if you ever feel like</i>

00:36.061 --> 00:38.529
<i>it and you're
interested, I'm here.</i>

00:38.531 --> 00:39.930
<i>She wants to get out</i>

00:39.932 --> 00:43.400
<i>from under my shadow, but
she'll never be able to.</i>

00:43.402 --> 00:47.938
<i>I've always wanted to find a woman
who could step into my shoes.</i>

00:47.940 --> 00:50.407
<i>I am offering you
my hand, Ellen.</i>

00:50.409 --> 00:52.809
<i>You chose winning over
everything-- your husband,</i>

<i>your son, me.</i>

00:55.114 --> 00:58.415
<i>All you have in your

Ms. Hewes.</i>

02:38.449 --> 02:41.918
<i>You're sitting
in Grandma's chair.</i>

<i>You're no one's mommy.</i>

<i>Get the fuck off!</i>

03:19.457 --> 03:20.090
<i>Patty.</i>

<i>Patty.</i>

03:24.263 --> 03:25.595
<i>You all right?</i>

03:25.597 --> 03:27.564
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:27.566 --> 03:29.466
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

03:29.468 --> 03:30.967
<i>This real estate
contact told me</i>

03:30.969 --> 03:32.436
<i>that Ellen has recently pulled</i>

03:32.438 --> 03:34.404
<i>the trigger on a
new office, and</i>

03:34.406 --> 03:36.039
<i>word is that a few clients have</i>

03:36.041 --> 03:39.643
<i>approached her, and she
turned them all down.</i>

03:39.645 --> 03:41.144
<i>Of course she did.</i>

03:41.146 --> 03:42.479
<i>She's waiting.</i>

03:42.481 --> 03:44.348
<i>For what?</i>

03:44.350 --> 03:48.418
<i>For a case big enough
to put her on the map.</i>

03:48.420 --> 03:50.721
<i>Now, look, this
obsession you have about this</i>

03:50.723 --> 03:51.955
<i>girl is a distraction.</i>

03:51.957 --> 03:54.291
<i>All she's trying to do is
get on with her life.</i>

03:54.293 --> 03:57.294
<i>Now, you forget about her.</i>

03:57.296 --> 03:58.795
<i>I can't.</i>

03:58.797 --> 03:59.796
<i>Why not?</i>

03:59.798 --> 04:01.631
<i>Oh, because she's going to
testify against you in</i>

04:01.633 --> 04:04.501
<i>Catherine's custody case?</i>

04:06.304 --> 04:07.871
<i>Ellen wants to hurt me.</i>

04:07.873 --> 04:11.508
<i>Ah, come on, big
deal, she can't hurt you.</i>

04:11.510 --> 04:14.644
<i>What are you worried about?</i>

04:14.646 --> 04:16.512
<i>She knows things.</i>

04:16.515 --> 04:19.916
<i>What do you
mean, she knows things?</i>

04:28.426 --> 04:30.961
<i>Oh.</i>

04:30.963 --> 04:34.164
<i>Well, that's a very
different story.</i>

04:41.172 --> 04:44.775
<i>So I just want to say
congratulations to both of</i>

04:44.777 --> 04:47.177
<i>you, and especially you, Tony.</i>

04:47.179 --> 04:49.613
<i>Come on, everyone here knows
that Tony has been trying to</i>

04:49.615 --> 04:52.115
<i>date Cheryl for--
since tenth grade.</i>

04:53.318 --> 04:55.585
<i>Somehow, after 15 years,
you got her to marry you.</i>

04:55.587 --> 04:58.622
<i>I don't know how
you did it, man.</i>

04:58.624 --> 05:01.191
<i>You-- you, my friend,
you're a lucky man.</i>

05:01.193 --> 05:01.858
<i>Yes.</i>

05:01.860 --> 05:04.494
<i>Raise your glasses.</i>

05:04.496 --> 05:05.829
<i>Here's to persistence.</i>

05:05.831 --> 05:06.830
<i>Thanks, bro.</i>

05:08.667 --> 05:10.066
<i>All right.</i>

05:16.808 --> 05:19.009
<i>Thanks, man.</i>

05:30.087 --> 05:32.255
<i>Hey, congratulations.</i>

05:32.257 --> 05:33.523
<i>Thanks, Parsons.</i>

05:33.525 --> 05:34.891
<i>That was so beautiful.</i>

05:34.893 --> 05:35.559
<i>Another bourbon?</i>

05:35.561 --> 05:36.526
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

05:36.528 --> 05:39.529
<i>Uh, I've got an early start, but,
uh, the next round is on me.</i>

05:39.531 --> 05:41.498
<i>It's already taken care of.</i>

05:41.500 --> 05:45.535
<i>Congratulations again.</i>

05:45.537 --> 05:47.971
<i>Hang on a second.</i>

05:47.973 --> 05:50.874
<i>Hey, you're not
sticking around?</i>

05:50.876 --> 05:54.678
<i>No, I should...
I should probably take off.</i>

05:54.680 --> 05:59.115
<i>I, uh, I'm sorry we didn't
really get to talk that much tonight.</i>

05:59.117 --> 06:00.550
<i>That's all right.</i>

06:00.552 --> 06:03.553
<i>Next time.</i>

06:03.555 --> 06:09.960
<i>At some point we should get
dinner, you know, sometime...</i>

06:09.962 --> 06:11.027
<i>or something.</i>

06:11.029 --> 06:13.563
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

06:13.565 --> 06:16.566
<i>No pressure.</i>

06:16.568 --> 06:17.701
<i>Whenever-- totally up to you.</i>

06:17.703 --> 06:18.368
<i>All right.</i>

06:20.172 --> 06:22.939
<i>It was really good to see you.</i>

06:33.552 --> 06:36.086
<i>Global trade has
grown dramatically, but the</i>

06:36.088 --> 06:38.989
<i>Panama Canal, one of the most...</i>

06:42.728 --> 06:44.427
<i>That is about to change.</i>

06:44.429 --> 06:46.897
<i>The expansion of the Panama
Canal is one of the largest</i>

06:46.899 --> 06:49.432
<i>construction projects in
the world right now-- a</i>

06:49.434 --> 06:51.001
<i>multibillion-dollar effort that</i>

06:51.003 --> 06:56.139
<i>will add a third channel
to the waterway...</i>

06:56.141 --> 06:59.576
<i>...allowing massive cargo
ships from China...</i>

07:22.099 --> 07:24.634
<i>Everything okay?</i>

07:24.636 --> 07:28.805
<i>Everything is
significantly better than okay.</i>

07:37.515 --> 07:39.950
<i>Can I ask you something?</i>

07:39.952 --> 07:42.452
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:42.454 --> 07:44.854
<i>Where the hell are we?</i>

07:49.761 --> 07:54.698
<i>This is my new office.</i>

07:54.700 --> 07:58.335
<i>You might want
to invest in some walls.</i>

08:00.338 --> 08:02.305
<i>Walls are overrated.</i>

08:02.307 --> 08:04.074
<i>You hungry?</i>

08:04.076 --> 08:07.978
<i>What are you doing
for breakfast?</i>

08:07.980 --> 08:11.281
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

08:11.283 --> 08:16.052
<i>Sorry, I have to be in
court this morning.</i>

08:16.054 --> 08:17.787
<i>You trying a new case?</i>

08:17.789 --> 08:20.523
<i>No, I don't
have any clients yet.</i>

08:20.525 --> 08:21.524
<i>It's something else.</i>

08:21.526 --> 08:23.960
<i>I'm a character witness.</i>

08:23.962 --> 08:25.462
<i>For what?</i>

08:25.464 --> 08:30.900
<i>I'm testifying against
Patty in a child custody case.</i>

08:30.902 --> 08:34.337
<i>I don't get it.</i>

08:34.339 --> 08:39.476
<i>Patty took her
granddaughter away from her son.</i>

08:39.477 --> 08:41.977
<i>Now he wants her back.</i>

08:41.980 --> 08:44.246
<i>Were you subpoenaed?</i>

08:44.249 --> 08:47.017
<i>No.</i>

08:47.019 --> 08:50.553
<i>I volunteered.</i>

08:50.555 --> 08:55.458
<i>I'm looking forward to it.</i>

09:08.673 --> 09:10.206
<i>The equity
long/short guys have been the</i>

09:10.208 --> 09:12.742
<i>darling of your
newspaper forever.</i>

09:12.744 --> 09:16.646
<i>Well, hell, no, I'm not bashful
about the Fund's successes,</i>

09:16.648 --> 09:18.648
<i>an-and you shouldn't be either.</i>

09:18.650 --> 09:21.785
<i>All I'm asking for is a little
positive press from you.</i>

09:21.787 --> 09:23.486
<i>That's all I'm saying.</i>

09:23.488 --> 09:25.321
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:25.323 --> 09:28.925
<i>Can you think of anyone more
useless than a financial reporter?</i>

09:28.927 --> 09:30.694
<i>Not off the top of my head.</i>

09:30.696 --> 09:32.829
<i>You wanted to see me?</i>

09:32.831 --> 09:35.799
<i>Some more information
is gonna be coming your way.</i>

09:35.801 --> 09:36.800
<i>I see.</i>

09:36.802 --> 09:38.802
<i>- So...
- Usual protocols.</i>

09:38.804 --> 09:39.736
<i>It stays on this floor.</i>

09:39.738 --> 09:42.038
<i>I do not want it going wide.</i>

09:42.040 --> 09:44.908
<i>Of course.</i>

09:44.910 --> 09:47.377
<i>Is there a problem, Naomi?</i>

09:47.379 --> 09:50.980
<i>No.</i>

09:50.982 --> 09:53.950
<i>We're up 22%
in a shitbag economy.</i>

09:53.952 --> 09:56.152
<i>Our strategies are paying off.</i>

09:56.154 --> 09:57.253
<i>Be happy.</i>

09:58.256 --> 10:00.323
<i>I got to take this.</i>

10:00.325 --> 10:02.559
<i>But I'm taking you
to lunch today.</i>

10:02.561 --> 10:04.861
<i>Steak, sushi, you
think about it.</i>

10:04.863 --> 10:06.463
<i>Bruce Davies.</i>

10:06.465 --> 10:08.264
<i>Fuck GenCorp.</i>

10:08.266 --> 10:10.834
<i>Wouldn't go near it.</i>

10:24.082 --> 10:25.982
<i>I've been</i>

10:25.984 --> 10:30.620
<i>living abroad for some time now,
which is natural for me.</i>

10:30.622 --> 10:32.055
<i>I grew up all over the world.</i>

10:32.057 --> 10:34.090
<i>But you are an American citizen.</i>

10:34.092 --> 10:36.292
<i>Technically.</i>

10:36.294 --> 10:38.194
<i>The American State Department</i>

10:38.196 --> 10:42.098
<i>said your web site is directly
responsible for the deaths of</i>

10:42.100 --> 10:44.300
<i>three diplomats in Iraq.</i>

10:44.302 --> 10:45.435
<i>Untrue.</i>

10:45.437 --> 10:47.837
<i>Still, if you're leaking
stolen information.</i>

10:47.839 --> 10:50.173
<i>I don't leak anything.</i>

10:50.175 --> 10:53.877
<i>I provide a safe haven for
whistleblowers who want to get</i>

10:53.879 --> 10:55.278
<i>information to the public.</i>

10:56.281 --> 10:59.315
<i>What about your personal life?</i>

11:00.619 --> 11:03.720
<i>It's difficult to have
one when you live in shadow.</i>

11:07.092 --> 11:09.692
<i>I receive a lot of threats.</i>

11:09.694 --> 11:12.862
<i>Governments and CEOs
throughout the world have...</i>

11:12.864 --> 11:13.630
<i>Turn it off.</i>

11:13.632 --> 11:15.799
<i>...condemned my web
site and its mission.</i>

11:15.801 --> 11:18.101
<i>- Do you recognize...
- You haven't seen the whole cut.</i>

11:18.103 --> 11:21.271
<i>I don't need to.</i>

11:21.273 --> 11:23.439
<i>PBS wants to air
it in the States.</i>

11:23.441 --> 11:24.541
<i>Do you approve?</i>

11:24.543 --> 11:26.009
<i>No.</i>

11:26.011 --> 11:29.445
<i>I don't like how I come off.</i>

11:29.447 --> 11:31.214
<i>I think you come off great.</i>

11:32.350 --> 11:34.417
<i>Channing?</i>

11:43.093 --> 11:44.794
<i>She called.</i>

11:44.796 --> 11:46.496
<i>Did she make a decision?</i>

11:46.498 --> 11:47.363
<i>No.</i>

11:47.365 --> 11:50.233
<i>She wants to have a
conversation, face-to-face.</i>

11:50.235 --> 11:51.634
<i>Fly her over here.</i>

11:51.636 --> 11:52.902
<i>She won't come.</i>

11:52.904 --> 11:56.506
<i>She doesn't want to cast
suspicion on herself.</i>

11:56.508 --> 12:00.543
<i>She said it's time-sensitive.</i>

12:06.317 --> 12:08.318
<i>Make arrangements.</i>

12:08.320 --> 12:11.754
<i>We're going to New York.</i>

12:11.756 --> 12:14.257
<i>I don't think that's wise.</i>

12:14.259 --> 12:16.125
<i>She'll come
through for us, Rutger.</i>

12:16.127 --> 12:18.194
<i>Trust me.</i>

12:22.366 --> 12:24.868
<i>I'd prefer to be
the one to talk to her.</i>

12:24.870 --> 12:28.304
<i>And we're gonna need to find
ourselves an attorney.</i>

12:28.306 --> 12:31.207
<i>Whatever you think is best.</i>

12:31.209 --> 12:33.276
<i>Just make arrangements.</i>

12:36.013 --> 12:37.881
<i>I respectfully request</i>

12:37.883 --> 12:41.251
<i>that Ms. Parsons be removed from
the witness list and not be</i>

12:41.253 --> 12:42.785
<i>allowed to testify, Your Honor.</i>

12:42.787 --> 12:44.921
<i>Ms. Parsons is a
legitimate character witness.</i>

12:44.923 --> 12:47.724
<i>She can attest to Ms. Hewes'
fitness as a parent.</i>

12:47.726 --> 12:51.361
<i>Ms. Parsons is
single and childless.</i>

12:51.363 --> 12:53.830
<i>She doesn't know the first
thing about motherhood.</i>

12:53.832 --> 12:54.797
<i>That's irrelevant.</i>

12:54.799 --> 12:56.566
<i>Ms. Hewes regularly brought my</i>

12:56.568 --> 12:58.334
<i>client's daughter to the office.</i>

12:58.336 --> 13:01.604
<i>Ellen Parsons was an
associate in my law firm.</i>

13:01.606 --> 13:04.140
<i>She signed a confidentiality
agreement, Your Honor.</i>

13:04.142 --> 13:08.878
<i>She can't testify to what she
witnessed-- or claims she</i>

13:08.880 --> 13:11.080
<i>witnessed-- while
working for me.</i>

13:11.082 --> 13:14.117
<i>You have the discretion
to decide that, Your Honor.</i>

13:14.119 --> 13:15.385
<i>All right, look.</i>

13:15.387 --> 13:19.689
<i>This weekend's Columbus Day,
and I'm going apple picking.</i>

13:19.691 --> 13:23.059
<i>I will take your briefs with
me and think about it.</i>

13:23.061 --> 13:23.726
<i>Thank you.</i>

13:23.728 --> 13:25.561
<i>Thank you, Your Honor.</i>

13:25.563 --> 13:27.931
<i>Sorry, Ms. Parsons,
I'm afraid you won't be</i>

13:27.933 --> 13:30.633
<i>testifying today.</i>

15:33.023 --> 15:35.158
<i>You have the right
to speak to an attorney.</i>

15:35.160 --> 15:37.226
<i>You're aware of that?</i>

15:47.871 --> 15:50.907
<i>I don't need an attorney.</i>

16:00.317 --> 16:02.985
<i>You make me come
to you, and you're late?</i>

16:02.987 --> 16:05.388
<i>I was stuck in a meeting.</i>

16:06.558 --> 16:08.991
<i>So, I have a proposal for you.</i>

16:08.993 --> 16:10.993
<i>Hmm, what's that?</i>

16:10.995 --> 16:14.430
<i>One weekend every three months.</i>

16:17.768 --> 16:19.001
<i>One weekend.</i>

16:19.003 --> 16:20.570
<i>It's generous.</i>

16:20.572 --> 16:25.041
<i>You haven't a legal leg to
stand on, so just take it.</i>

16:25.043 --> 16:27.844
<i>What happened?</i>

16:27.846 --> 16:32.148
<i>Until today, you've refused to
move an inch; now suddenly</i>

16:32.150 --> 16:34.283
<i>you're making an offer?</i>

16:34.285 --> 16:36.752
<i>Michael, I have
real cases to try.</i>

16:36.754 --> 16:38.454
<i>I can't waste my time on this.</i>

16:38.456 --> 16:39.622
<i>No.</i>

16:39.624 --> 16:41.357
<i>You're afraid.</i>

16:44.229 --> 16:45.761
<i>Of you?</i>

16:47.532 --> 16:48.831
<i>No.</i>

16:48.833 --> 16:51.300
<i>You don't want
Ellen to testify.</i>

16:51.302 --> 16:56.506
<i>You're worried about what
she's going to say.</i>

16:56.508 --> 17:01.310
<i>What does she know
about you anyway?</i>

17:01.312 --> 17:04.881
<i>One weekend every three months.</i>

17:06.251 --> 17:07.282
<i>Not good enough.</i>

17:07.285 --> 17:10.319
<i>It's better than
you'll get in a trial.</i>

17:12.388 --> 17:13.422
<i>Ms. Hewes?</i>

17:13.424 --> 17:14.323
<i>Yeah?</i>

17:14.325 --> 17:16.358
<i>A Rutger Simon called for you.</i>

17:16.361 --> 17:17.827
<i>In regard to what?</i>

17:17.829 --> 17:20.896
<i>Channing McClaren
wants to meet with you.</i>

17:46.957 --> 17:49.792
<i>I'm grateful
you came, Ms. Hewes.</i>

17:49.794 --> 17:51.494
<i>I've been following
your career.</i>

17:51.496 --> 17:52.995
<i>Likewise.</i>

17:52.997 --> 17:54.864
<i>So you know what I do?</i>

17:54.866 --> 17:56.832
<i>Of course.</i>

17:56.834 --> 17:58.968
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

17:58.970 --> 18:01.537
<i>I'm going to be
receiving some sensitive</i>

18:01.539 --> 18:03.005
<i>information soon.</i>

18:03.007 --> 18:04.507
<i>I'll need a civil attorney.</i>

18:04.509 --> 18:06.642
<i>What kind of information?</i>

18:06.644 --> 18:09.212
<i>I can't tell you that.</i>

18:09.214 --> 18:12.148
<i>Can you give
me the general area?</i>

18:12.150 --> 18:15.084
<i>I just said I can't tell you.</i>

18:15.086 --> 18:17.153
<i>Don't waste my time.</i>

18:22.960 --> 18:24.360
<i>It's about Wall Street.</i>

18:24.362 --> 18:27.930
<i>A rather large investment
bank has been misbehaving.</i>

18:27.932 --> 18:29.699
<i>How large?</i>

18:29.701 --> 18:31.734
<i>The institution's
over a century old.</i>

18:31.736 --> 18:35.238
<i>Its assets are worth
$500 billion.</i>

18:35.240 --> 18:38.040
<i>And you think as soon as
this information comes out,</i>

18:38.042 --> 18:39.242
<i>someone's going to sue you?</i>

18:39.244 --> 18:42.345
<i>It happens every
time I post a leak.</i>

18:42.347 --> 18:45.715
<i>I've been living in Europe for
the past decade, but...</i>

18:45.717 --> 18:49.752
<i>now I need an American attorney.</i>

18:49.754 --> 18:52.021
<i>I appreciate some of
your work, Mr. McClaren,</i>

18:52.023 --> 18:55.992
<i>but I'm not sure I approve
of your methods.</i>

18:55.994 --> 18:58.327
<i>My methods?</i>

18:58.329 --> 19:01.264
<i>The hacking world's
like the Wild West,</i>

19:01.266 --> 19:03.766
<i>and you're the
self-appointed sheriff.</i>

19:03.768 --> 19:05.868
<i>Who's policing you?</i>

19:05.870 --> 19:09.105
<i>I don't need policing.</i>

19:09.107 --> 19:11.440
<i>I expose the truth.</i>

19:11.442 --> 19:14.310
<i>By stealing secrets?</i>

19:16.880 --> 19:19.582
<i>I'm flattered by
your interest, but...</i>

19:19.584 --> 19:24.420
<i>you and I aren't a good fit.</i>

19:24.422 --> 19:26.989
<i>Don't be stupid.</i>

19:26.991 --> 19:31.761
<i>You need me.</i>

19:31.763 --> 19:33.462
<i>Do I?</i>

19:33.464 --> 19:35.398
<i>More than I need you.</i>

19:35.400 --> 19:36.699
<i>You're an old woman.</i>

19:36.701 --> 19:39.001
<i>You have just a handful of
productive years left</i>

19:39.003 --> 19:41.070
<i>until my generation unseats you.</i>

19:41.072 --> 19:44.907
<i>You may dislike my
methods, but...</i>

19:44.909 --> 19:47.710
<i>with me, you'll stay relevant.</i>

19:49.179 --> 19:53.015
<i>I'll take my
chances without you.</i>

20:00.657 --> 20:04.226
<i>But if you're looking
for an attorney...</i>

20:13.470 --> 20:16.706
<i>This is the best one I know.</i>

20:32.356 --> 20:34.557
<i>Thank you for flying
over, but I prefer to talk</i>

20:34.559 --> 20:35.591
<i>directly to Mr. McClaren.</i>

20:35.593 --> 20:39.228
<i>Channing thought it
was best you deal with me.</i>

20:43.835 --> 20:46.102
<i>They got another tip.</i>

20:46.104 --> 20:49.338
<i>This one's gonna
make them billions.</i>

20:49.340 --> 20:52.508
<i>How high up the
ladder does this go?</i>

20:52.510 --> 20:53.542
<i>I can't say.</i>

20:53.544 --> 20:55.878
<i>I only know what
happens in Fund 23.</i>

20:55.880 --> 20:58.981
<i>My supervisor runs
it as he sees fit.</i>

20:58.983 --> 21:01.317
<i>You can stop him.</i>

21:01.319 --> 21:03.619
<i>You have the evidence, right?</i>

21:03.621 --> 21:06.122
<i>Fund records, trades,
account information?</i>

21:06.124 --> 21:08.858
<i>I have access to everything.</i>

21:08.860 --> 21:11.060
<i>Good.</i>

21:11.062 --> 21:13.362
<i>I do this, they're
gonna shut the Fund down.</i>

21:13.364 --> 21:14.397
<i>I won't have a job.</i>

21:14.399 --> 21:17.867
<i>We can guarantee
your anonymity.</i>

21:17.869 --> 21:21.203
<i>Your name will be removed.</i>

21:21.205 --> 21:24.673
<i>I have a daughter.</i>

21:24.675 --> 21:26.976
<i>She's applying to college.</i>

21:30.714 --> 21:33.783
<i>I don't know if I can be in
the middle of all of this.</i>

21:33.785 --> 21:37.019
<i>I understand.</i>

21:37.021 --> 21:42.091
<i>Not everyone can
handle the pressure.</i>

21:42.093 --> 21:47.563
<i>But if you do want to move forward,
use this to encrypt your data.</i>

21:47.565 --> 21:48.998
<i>There's instructions in here,</i>

21:49.000 --> 21:52.234
<i>how to upload everything
to our server.</i>

21:52.236 --> 21:56.172
<i>If you decide you can help us,
these codes are good for</i>

21:56.174 --> 21:58.207
<i>the next 48 hours.</i>

22:16.893 --> 22:19.228
<i>So, why would you turn
down McClaren as a client?</i>

22:19.230 --> 22:20.396
<i>I don't like him.</i>

22:20.398 --> 22:23.199
<i>Well, what the hell does
that got to do with anything?</i>

22:23.201 --> 22:24.300
<i>This kid's the new wave.</i>

22:24.302 --> 22:26.302
<i>He's an international
phenomenon.</i>

22:26.304 --> 22:28.337
<i>He's arrogant
and he's dangerous.</i>

22:33.211 --> 22:34.510
<i>Huh.</i>

22:34.512 --> 22:35.611
<i>What?</i>

22:35.613 --> 22:37.446
<i>What is it?</i>

22:39.350 --> 22:43.619
<i>The judge is going to
let Ellen testify against me.</i>

22:43.621 --> 22:45.654
<i>So, now you got
to protect yourself.</i>

22:45.656 --> 22:50.993
<i>You got to forget about
your granddaughter.</i>

22:50.995 --> 22:54.930
<i>Oh, come on, you don't want her anyway;
she's just another distraction.</i>

22:54.932 --> 22:57.066
<i>I sent my kids to boarding
school; I gave them to someone</i>

22:57.068 --> 22:59.068
<i>who knew what to do with them.</i>

22:59.070 --> 23:02.972
<i>Michael has no idea
what it means to be a parent.</i>

23:02.974 --> 23:05.040
<i>Do you?</i>

23:05.042 --> 23:05.808
<i>You tried it once.</i>

23:05.810 --> 23:08.010
<i>It didn't work.</i>

23:08.012 --> 23:09.745
<i>Now you got to move on.</i>

23:09.747 --> 23:11.280
<i>You got to focus
on your career.</i>

23:11.282 --> 23:14.383
<i>Take McClaren as a client.</i>

23:23.159 --> 23:25.261
<i>If you're so worried that
Parsons gonna hang you in</i>

23:25.263 --> 23:31.634
<i>court, then you got to suck it up
and give your son back his kid.</i>

23:40.043 --> 23:42.077
<i>I was thinking about you.</i>

23:42.079 --> 23:47.583
<i>Are you sure you want to get
involved in Patty's custody battle?</i>

23:47.585 --> 23:50.486
<i>Seems a bit personal.</i>

23:50.488 --> 23:53.188
<i>It's already personal
between me and Patty.</i>

23:53.190 --> 23:56.892
<i>Testifying against her is
the least I could do.</i>

23:56.894 --> 23:59.962
<i>What do you mean?</i>

24:02.666 --> 24:09.772
<i>Patty's...
done certain things.</i>

24:09.774 --> 24:11.907
<i>Like what?</i>

24:11.909 --> 24:16.946
<i>It's probably
better if I don't tell you.</i>

24:16.948 --> 24:18.180
<i>Okay.</i>

24:18.182 --> 24:21.350
<i>The woman belongs in prison.</i>

24:21.352 --> 24:23.419
<i>So go to the police.</i>

24:23.421 --> 24:28.223
<i>The things I know
about her, I-I can't prove.</i>

24:28.225 --> 24:31.694
<i>I don't have any hard evidence.</i>

24:31.696 --> 24:33.963
<i>It would just be my
word against hers.</i>

24:33.965 --> 24:39.969
<i>Well...
all I'm saying is, you're trying to</i>

24:39.971 --> 24:41.770
<i>move your career forward.</i>

24:41.772 --> 24:42.938
<i>Patty's very powerful.</i>

24:42.940 --> 24:44.773
<i>She could hurt you.</i>

24:44.775 --> 24:47.843
<i>I hear you.</i>

24:50.380 --> 24:54.717
<i>You're not the first person
to warn me about Patty.</i>

25:00.657 --> 25:01.924
<i>Detectives.</i>

25:01.926 --> 25:03.125
<i>Come in.</i>

25:03.127 --> 25:04.827
<i>Hi. It's been a while.</i>

25:04.829 --> 25:05.861
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:05.863 --> 25:09.465
<i>Thanks, uh, thanks
so much for coming.</i>

25:09.467 --> 25:12.001
<i>We have the
evidence you asked for.</i>

25:12.003 --> 25:13.002
<i>I appreciate it.</i>

25:13.004 --> 25:14.003
<i>You were lucky.</i>

25:14.005 --> 25:16.038
<i>Uh, usually when a case is
solved, uh, this stuff gets</i>

25:16.040 --> 25:17.006
<i>shipped upstate.</i>

25:17.008 --> 25:19.008
<i>You really didn't
have to bring it down.</i>

25:19.010 --> 25:20.209
<i>I was happy to come pick it up.</i>

25:20.211 --> 25:22.478
<i>Well, we were
glad to hear from you.</i>

25:22.480 --> 25:25.781
<i>We were wondering how
you were doing.</i>

25:25.783 --> 25:27.650
<i>Oh, good. Thanks.</i>

25:27.652 --> 25:30.619
<i>Uh, Detective Ortiz</i>

25:30.621 --> 25:33.756
<i>and I talk about your
fiancé's case all the time.</i>

25:33.758 --> 25:35.991
<i>It's good to see you're well.</i>

25:35.993 --> 25:37.159
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:37.161 --> 25:40.429
<i>Anyway, this evidence, um,</i>

25:40.431 --> 25:41.864
<i>well, we bent the rules to get</i>

25:41.866 --> 25:44.900
<i>you this, so can you give us a
heads-up when you're done?</i>

25:44.902 --> 25:48.037
<i>Yeah, of...
absolutely, of course.</i>

25:51.374 --> 25:52.908
<i>You take care.</i>

25:52.910 --> 25:55.878
<i>If you need anything,
you let us know?</i>

25:55.880 --> 25:57.946
<i>I will.</i>

26:34.651 --> 26:38.854
<i>You're special, Ellen, but that
will only make the fall harder.</i>

26:38.856 --> 26:41.290
<i>There won't be room
for you and Patty.</i>

26:41.292 --> 26:43.559
<i>With Patty Hewes,
there's only Patty.</i>

26:43.561 --> 26:48.297
<i>She'll see what I see,
and she'll own you.</i>

27:35.445 --> 27:41.617
<i>Ms. Hewes...
Ellen Parsons is missing.</i>

27:41.619 --> 27:45.254
<i>Oh.</i>

27:45.256 --> 27:48.524
<i>Any idea where she's at?</i>

28:49.920 --> 28:51.787
<i>Mom?</i>

28:51.789 --> 28:52.888
<i>Hmm?</i>

28:52.890 --> 28:55.591
<i>I'm gonna go meet
some friends downtown.</i>

28:55.593 --> 28:58.160
<i>All right.
When do you think you'll be home?</i>

28:58.162 --> 28:59.161
<i>Not late.</i>

28:59.163 --> 29:03.699
<i>I have my interview at City
College in the morning.</i>

29:03.701 --> 29:04.967
<i>All right. Have fun.</i>

29:04.969 --> 29:05.968
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:05.970 --> 29:06.969
<i>Bye.</i>

29:06.971 --> 29:08.136
<i>Bye.</i>

29:08.138 --> 29:10.072
<i>I love you.</i>

29:49.245 --> 29:51.246
<i>Princefield, one of

<i>Company documents posted

<i>McClaren, suggest that
Princefield's Fund 23 reaped</i>

<i>massive profits from a widespread
program of insider trading.</i>

30:09.833 --> 30:13.402
<i>Government agencies have already
called for a full investigation.</i>

30:13.404 --> 30:15.237
<i>Insider trading?</i>
<i>How did this happen?</i>

30:15.239 --> 30:17.940
<i>I don't know.</i>

30:17.942 --> 30:19.441
<i>But it fucking happened.</i>

30:19.443 --> 30:23.278
<i>Channing McClaren got a hold
of all of our records.</i>

30:23.280 --> 30:25.981
<i>Did you have anything
to do with this?</i>

30:25.983 --> 30:27.015
<i>Of course not.</i>

30:27.017 --> 30:31.820
<i>Well, it seems like everything
came out of your goddamn computer.</i>

30:31.822 --> 30:32.854
<i>That's not possible.</i>

30:32.856 --> 30:36.959
<i>I don't know what you fucking
did, Naomi, but we're all dead.</i>

<i>You, me, every trader
on this floor.</i>

30:40.431 --> 30:44.132
<i>I suppose I should
feel insulted.</i>

<i>What are you talking about?</i>

30:47.972 --> 30:54.576
<i>"Personal e-mails
reveal trader's sex-capades."</i>

30:54.578 --> 30:56.445

<i>graphic and sexually explicit
content belonging to a Naomi</i>

31:15.766 --> 31:17.566
<i>Walling, a Princefield employee.</i>

31:17.568 --> 31:21.436
<i>Hundreds of personal e-mail
messages containing intimate</i>

31:21.438 --> 31:25.240
<i>details appear to romantically
link Ms. Walling to several</i>

31:25.242 --> 31:29.011
<i>high-level Wall
Street executives.</i>

31:29.013 --> 31:30.779
<i>The inclusion of this personal</i>

31:30.781 --> 31:32.581
<i>content calls into question Mr.</i>

31:32.583 --> 31:35.450
<i>McClaren's ability to disseminate
sensitive material</i>

31:35.452 --> 31:39.388
<i>and directly contradicts his
principle of not identifying</i>

31:39.390 --> 31:44.526
<i>whistleblowers who
contribute to his site.</i>

31:44.528 --> 31:47.729
<i>Why would McClaren want to
air this woman's dirty laundry?</i>

31:47.731 --> 31:51.633
<i>I told you I didn't like him.</i>

31:51.635 --> 31:54.136
<i>What, do you think
he did this on purpose?</i>

31:54.138 --> 31:58.340
<i>No. It's got to be, um...
it's got to be a screwup.</i>

31:58.342 --> 32:00.442
<i>Regardless, there is</i>

32:00.444 --> 32:06.314
<i>a very... interesting case here.</i>

32:06.316 --> 32:10.452
<i>You gonna want to sue McClaren?</i>

32:12.622 --> 32:14.723
<i>How the hell did this happen?</i>

32:14.725 --> 32:19.227
<i>And why won't you
assholes call me back?</i>

32:19.229 --> 32:21.530
<i>Mom?</i>

32:21.532 --> 32:22.564
<i>I heard.</i>

32:22.566 --> 32:24.866
<i>I can't talk about
this right now, Rachel.</i>

32:24.868 --> 32:27.369
<i>Mom...
Mom, are you okay?</i>

32:27.371 --> 32:29.404
<i>I can't.</i>

32:38.449 --> 32:39.448
<i>Hello.</i>

32:39.450 --> 32:40.449
<i>Hello.</i>

32:40.451 --> 32:43.418
<i>This is Patty Hewes.</i>

33:53.123 --> 33:56.191
<i>Channing.</i>

34:05.835 --> 34:09.371
<i>So, why didn't you
take credit for High Star?</i>

34:09.373 --> 34:12.541
<i>Why do you want to know?</i>

34:12.543 --> 34:14.543
<i>Howard Erickson's in prison.</i>

34:14.545 --> 34:17.478
<i>You filed the case.</i>

34:17.481 --> 34:21.248
<i>But Patty Hewes got the glory.</i>

34:21.251 --> 34:24.286
<i>Why did you
contact me, Mr. McClaren?</i>

34:24.288 --> 34:29.090
<i>I assume you've seen the news.</i>

34:29.092 --> 34:34.196
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:34.197 --> 34:35.397
<i>This kind of thing</i>

34:35.399 --> 34:36.965
<i>has never happened to me before.</i>

34:36.967 --> 34:38.132
<i>What kind of thing?</i>

34:38.135 --> 34:45.172
<i>Someone's personal
information being posted on my site.</i>

34:45.175 --> 34:46.841
<i>Naomi Walling was
a whistleblower.</i>

34:46.842 --> 34:49.710
<i>She came to me with revelations
about Princefield.</i>

34:49.713 --> 34:52.414
<i>I would never expose
one of my sources.</i>

34:52.416 --> 34:54.849
<i>And I have no interest in
attacking her personal life.</i>

34:54.851 --> 34:55.984
<i>Then how did Ms.</i>

34:55.985 --> 34:57.986
<i>Walling's information
get out there?</i>

34:57.988 --> 35:04.326
<i>I don't know, but it is
very bad for my organization.</i>

35:04.328 --> 35:08.630
<i>We're still trying
to figure it out.</i>

35:12.335 --> 35:16.371
<i>Do you think Walling
will sue me?</i>

35:16.373 --> 35:18.106
<i>Quite possibly.</i>

35:18.108 --> 35:20.909
<i>But do you think
she'll have a case against me?</i>

35:20.911 --> 35:24.112
<i>It depends on the details
of what actually happened.</i>

35:24.114 --> 35:25.113
<i>Okay, stop.</i>

35:25.115 --> 35:27.682
<i>Listen, what I'm asking
you is, will she sue me?</i>

35:27.684 --> 35:31.119
<i>Mr. McClaren, I
don't know what she'll do.</i>

35:31.121 --> 35:34.356
<i>You're not wrong to
fear a lawsuit.</i>

35:34.358 --> 35:38.893
<i>You need a lawyer.</i>

35:38.895 --> 35:42.764
<i>Is that why I'm here?</i>

35:42.766 --> 35:45.533
<i>Yes.</i>

35:45.535 --> 35:49.738
<i>I'd like to hire you.</i>

35:49.740 --> 35:56.911
<i>Well...
I'm interested...</i>

35:56.913 --> 35:59.414
<i>but I-I just went out on my own.</i>

35:59.416 --> 36:02.317
<i>I doubt I have the resources
that you'll need.</i>

36:02.319 --> 36:04.319
<i>No, resources aren't a problem.</i>

36:04.321 --> 36:09.457
<i>I have sponsors, donors
with deep pockets.</i>

36:09.459 --> 36:14.763
<i>I'm just curious, but...
why me?</i>

36:16.098 --> 36:19.334
<i>You came very
highly recommended.</i>

36:19.336 --> 36:22.270
<i>By whom?</i>

36:22.272 --> 36:26.341
<i>Patty Hewes.</i>

36:29.312 --> 36:31.846
<i>Patty gave you my name?</i>

36:31.848 --> 36:37.552
<i>She thinks you're
a very skilled attorney.</i>

36:43.959 --> 36:45.060
<i>Well, um, Mr.</i>

36:45.062 --> 36:47.295
<i>McClaren, I'm going to
have to think about this.</i>

36:47.297 --> 36:50.665
<i>Of course.</i>

36:50.667 --> 36:53.935
<i>I look forward to
speaking with you.</i>

37:01.277 --> 37:03.478
<i>Uh, can you just
wait here for a second?</i>

37:03.480 --> 37:07.382
<i>Of course.</i>

37:07.384 --> 37:10.552
<i>Mom, Patty Hewes is here.</i>

37:10.554 --> 37:11.853
<i>She wants to talk to you.</i>

37:11.855 --> 37:14.122
<i>I don't want to
talk to any lawyers.</i>

37:14.124 --> 37:15.123
<i>She called.</i>

37:15.125 --> 37:17.292
<i>She called. She...
I asked her to come.</i>

37:17.294 --> 37:19.427
<i>She said that she
could help you.</i>

37:25.000 --> 37:25.967
<i>Please leave.</i>

37:25.969 --> 37:29.070
<i>I'm sorry you had to waste a
trip up here, but I don't need</i>

37:29.072 --> 37:30.038
<i>an attorney.</i>

37:30.040 --> 37:32.574
<i>Mom, listen to
what she has to say.</i>

37:32.576 --> 37:35.176
<i>I understand how you must
be feeling right now, but</i>

37:35.178 --> 37:37.312
<i>you have a good case.</i>

37:37.314 --> 37:40.849
<i>Channing McClaren
violated your privacy.</i>

37:40.851 --> 37:44.486
<i>The information that was
leaked came from your files.</i>

37:44.488 --> 37:47.255
<i>Either you provided it willingly,
and he was supposed</i>

37:47.257 --> 37:49.624
<i>to leave out</i>
your personal information...

37:49.626 --> 37:50.825
I asked you to leave.

37:50.827 --> 37:53.461
Or he hacked in and
stole everything from you.

37:53.463 --> 37:55.697
We're through here.

37:55.699 --> 37:59.801
What are you afraid of, the bank?
McClaren?

37:59.803 --> 38:02.270
Don't make me call downstairs.

38:02.272 --> 38:07.675
You are under
tremendous scrutiny right now.

38:07.677 --> 38:12.847
It seems as though there is nowhere to
turn, but you are being very foolish.

38:12.849 --> 38:15.784
I don't want any
more media attention.

38:15.786 --> 38:18.453
Suing him will only
make it worse.

38:18.455 --> 38:20.722
Everything is gonna
get worse, no matter what.

38:20.724 --> 38:23.324
The bank is gonna blame
the fraud on you.

38:23.326 --> 38:25.493
McClaren is gonna throw
you under the bus.

38:25.495 --> 38:29.230
And day after day, the vultures
in the press are gonna have a

38:29.232 --> 38:34.502
a feeding frenzy over
your reputation.

38:34.504 --> 38:42.010
- Please...
- Mrs. Walling, let me protect you.

38:50.686 --> 38:55.690
Donald, there's a
woman here that won't leave.

38:56.859 --> 39:00.895
Yes, call the police.

39:01.864 --> 39:07.335
Please think
about what I'm saying.

39:15.444 --> 39:18.046
I'm...
I am so sorry, Ms. Hewes.

39:18.048 --> 39:19.047
She's just upset.

39:19.049 --> 39:22.350
- She didn't mean to...
- Your mother's not thinking clearly.

39:22.352 --> 39:24.385
She needs help.

39:24.387 --> 39:29.090
So, when she calms
down, you talk to her.

39:29.092 --> 39:30.525
I will.

39:30.527 --> 39:34.596
Okay.

39:40.402 --> 39:42.470
Channing McClaren?

39:42.472 --> 39:44.472
That's great.

39:44.474 --> 39:48.309
He's exactly the kind
of client you need.

39:48.311 --> 39:52.580
Yeah, except Patty
recommended me to him.

39:52.582 --> 39:53.648
Oh.

39:53.650 --> 39:55.483
Shit.

39:55.485 --> 39:57.919
You think she's
fucking with you?

39:57.921 --> 40:00.188
Somehow.

40:00.190 --> 40:03.358
If I accept the job with
McClaren, I'll be playing right

40:03.360 --> 40:06.494
into Patty's game.

40:06.496 --> 40:10.765
So, what are you going to do?

40:10.767 --> 40:15.169
Any idea what she's up to?

40:15.171 --> 40:17.171
My mother won't listen.

40:17.173 --> 40:18.439
I couldn't change her mind.

40:18.441 --> 40:21.009
Do you know if the
personal things that have been

40:21.011 --> 40:24.112
written about her are true?

40:24.114 --> 40:28.550
She had affairs,
if that's what you mean.

40:28.552 --> 40:31.452
My father left
when I was seven.

40:31.454 --> 40:36.257
She's had problems with men,
but she didn't deserve this.

40:36.259 --> 40:38.593
No, of course not.

40:38.595 --> 40:40.528
But why are you here, Rachel?

40:40.530 --> 40:42.163
What do you want me to do?

40:42.165 --> 40:44.265
Punish McClaren.

40:44.267 --> 40:47.635
I can't if your mother
isn't willing to be a plaintiff.

40:47.637 --> 40:50.838
Then... I'll sue him.

40:51.942 --> 40:54.943
Your mother is the
one who was wronged.

40:54.945 --> 40:58.913
Unfortunately, I can't bring
a suit on your behalf.

40:58.915 --> 41:04.085
So, McClaren destroys my mother's
life, and he gets to just walk away?

41:04.087 --> 41:07.288
I'm afraid so.

41:07.290 --> 41:11.225
Ms. Hewes, I'm
worried about my mom.

41:11.227 --> 41:13.895
She's had problems before.

41:13.897 --> 41:15.997
What kind of problems?

41:15.999 --> 41:17.332
Anxiety, depression.

41:17.334 --> 41:19.701
She... It's not good.

41:19.703 --> 41:22.270
I've seen how dark she gets.

41:22.272 --> 41:26.774
Well, I can give you the
name of a good psychiatrist.

41:26.776 --> 41:29.911
But if she doesn't want to file
a suit, there's nothing else

41:29.913 --> 41:31.946
I can do for her.

41:31.948 --> 41:36.084
Mm.

41:38.621 --> 41:41.089
Rachel?

41:42.759 --> 41:46.094
If there are new developments,
if your mother chang her mind,

41:46.096 --> 41:51.132
I promise you, I'll
be here to help.

41:51.134 --> 41:54.202
Yeah.

41:55.804 --> 41:58.106
Yes, I have
documents right here.

41:58.108 --> 41:59.540
Yes, you can send a courier.

41:59.542 --> 42:00.908
So much for that.

42:00.910 --> 42:01.909
Thank you.

42:01.911 --> 42:03.311
Have a good day.

42:03.313 --> 42:06.948
The kid said her
mother battled depression.

42:06.950 --> 42:09.884
With any luck,
she'll off herself.

42:09.886 --> 42:12.987
Then you'll be
back in business.

43:27.863 --> 43:33.434
Tomorrow's the big day.

43:33.436 --> 43:39.574
Ellen Parsons is
going to testify.

43:48.583 --> 43:52.475
She'll see what I
see, and she'll own you.

44:15.911 --> 44:18.079
It's done.

44:42.171 --> 44:45.740
I could put this gun to
your head and get you to say

44:45.742 --> 44:50.411
it, but I don't want
it to be that way.

44:50.413 --> 44:53.781
You know what I want to hear.

44:53.783 --> 44:56.237
I told Pete...

44:57.866 --> 45:00.755
to have you killed.

45:09.565 --> 45:12.700
Am I correct that
directly out of law school Patty

45:12.702 --> 45:15.036
Hewes hired you to
work at her firm?

45:15.038 --> 45:16.938
Yes.

45:16.940 --> 45:21.175
And you've worked with her on
and off for a period of four years?

45:21.177 --> 45:22.176
Yes.

45:22.178 --> 45:26.414
During that time, would you
say that you got to know her well?

45:30.986 --> 45:34.789
Very well.

45:34.791 --> 45:39.260
Broadly, how would
you describe her character?

45:49.205 --> 45:55.543
Your Honor... I respectfully
request a stay in these proceedings.

45:55.545 --> 45:57.245
Why?

45:57.247 --> 45:58.512
I believe neither Ms.

45:58.514 --> 46:01.515
Parsons' state of mind nor her
testimony can be considered

46:01.517 --> 46:04.085
impartial at this time.

46:04.087 --> 46:07.755
What makes you say that?

46:07.757 --> 46:10.691
Ms. Parsons and I will
soon be engaged as opposing

46:10.693 --> 46:17.632
attorneys in what will be a
highly publicized lawsuit.

46:17.634 --> 46:20.701
What kind of lawsuit?

46:20.703 --> 46:28.142
Last night a woman named Naomi
Walling tragically took her own life.

46:55.872 --> 46:59.040
Shh...

47:21.296 --> 47:24.665
This morning I was
contracted by Naomi Walling's

47:24.667 --> 47:31.205
daughter to pursue a wrongful
death suit on her behalf.

47:31.207 --> 47:34.742
And who is
this lawsuit against?

47:34.744 --> 47:40.348
Channing McClaren...
whom I believe is Ms.

47:40.350 --> 47:42.850
Parsons'... only client.

47:47.089 --> 47:51.592
I'm not going to have
<i>another</i> case tried in my courtroom.

47:51.594 --> 47:55.563
If this is accurate, Ms. Parsons,
then it's one or the other.

47:55.565 --> 48:02.603
You can either testify against Ms.
Hewes or try a case against her.

48:02.605 --> 48:04.839
What's it going to be?

48:12.481 --> 48:15.616
I'd like ten
minutes to consider.

48:28.397 --> 48:32.233
Looks like you
have a decision to make.

48:34.703 --> 48:40.241
Whatever you're going to say on the
stand won't help Michael win custody.

48:40.243 --> 48:42.977
But I'll say it anyway.

48:42.979 --> 48:48.282
It'll be on the record...
and the public will know the truth about you.

48:52.954 --> 48:56.791
McClaren said you
recommended me.

48:56.793 --> 49:00.995
Do you think he would have
hired you without my recommendation?

49:00.997 --> 49:04.198
I haven't
accepted the job, Patty.

49:04.200 --> 49:07.501
What are you waiting for?

49:09.504 --> 49:12.706
You can either get up on the
stand and trumpet my secrets to

49:12.708 --> 49:17.545
the world... or you can do
what you really want to do.

49:17.547 --> 49:20.681
And what is that?

49:20.683 --> 49:23.951
Come after me where it counts.

49:23.953 --> 49:28.689
Prove yourself in a
case against me.

49:28.691 --> 49:30.724
You hate me?

49:30.726 --> 49:33.961
You want to end this
once and for all?

49:33.963 --> 49:36.730
Now's your fucking chance.

50:11.433 --> 50:13.033
Mr. McClaren.

50:13.035 --> 50:15.169
It's Ellen Parsons.

50:15.171 --> 50:17.571
I want the job.

50:33.054 --> 50:35.689
Detective, I don't know
what you're hoping to learn

50:35.691 --> 50:39.226
from me, but I'm supposed to
be in court right about now.

50:39.228 --> 50:40.861
We know.

50:40.863 --> 50:44.932
Ellen Parsons was scheduled
to testify against you today.
