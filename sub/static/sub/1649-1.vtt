00:16.809 --> 00:19.801
(growling, snarling)

00:19.979 --> 00:22.140
Rick: I guess I'm losing hope
that you can hear me.

00:22.315 --> 00:24.931
But there's always that
chance, isn't there?

00:25.109 --> 00:27.270
That slim chance.

00:27.445 --> 00:30.107
It's all about
slim chances now.

00:31.490 --> 00:34.277
I tried to do
everything right,

00:34.452 --> 00:36.738
keep people safe.

00:36.913 --> 00:38.949
I tried, Morgan.

00:39.123 --> 00:42.331
I tried.

00:44.837 --> 00:47.169
Our group's smaller now.

00:47.340 --> 00:50.332
We lost another,
day before last.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.835
It was her choice.

00:54.013 --> 00:55.844
I won't say I blame her.

00:56.015 --> 00:58.006
She lost faith.

00:58.184 --> 01:00.846
The CDC was a dead end.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.645
I met a man there,

01:04.815 --> 01:07.101
a scientist.

01:07.276 --> 01:09.733
He told me something.

01:11.322 --> 01:13.483
He told me...

01:16.369 --> 01:17.654
it doesn't matter.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.910
What matters
is we're moving on.

01:20.081 --> 01:22.163
Atlanta's done.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.619
We're gonna try
for Fort Benning.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.171
maybe even harder
than I can imagine.

01:31.342 --> 01:33.754
But it can't be harder
than ourjourney's been so far.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.510
Can it?

01:36.681 --> 01:39.718
125 miles--

01:39.892 --> 01:41.678
that's what lies ahead.

01:43.646 --> 01:46.228
And I'm trying hard
not to lose faith.

01:46.399 --> 01:48.981
I can't.
If I do, the others...

01:50.653 --> 01:53.895
my family, my wife...

01:56.409 --> 01:59.242
my son.

01:59.412 --> 02:01.198
There's just a few
of us now.

02:01.372 --> 02:04.580
So we've got to
stick together,

02:04.750 --> 02:06.741
fight for each other,

02:06.919 --> 02:10.377
be willing to lay down
our lives for each other

02:10.548 --> 02:13.255
if it comes to that.

02:13.426 --> 02:15.667
Son, let's saddle up.

02:15.845 --> 02:18.052
Rick:
It's the only chance we've got.

02:20.266 --> 02:22.723
(engine starts)

02:27.565 --> 02:30.102
Be careful
out there, Morgan.

02:30.276 --> 02:33.609
I hope you and Duane
are okay.

02:34.989 --> 02:37.401
Stay off the road.

02:37.575 --> 02:39.941
Keep moving.

02:40.119 --> 02:42.656
Keep your eyes open.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.946
I don't know, just--

02:45.124 --> 02:47.536
just be safe.

02:50.463 --> 02:53.000
Maybe we'll see you
in Fort Benning someday.

02:54.550 --> 02:57.587
Rick signing off.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.411
(theme music playing )

04:02.034 --> 04:05.151
(birds chirping)

04:27.977 --> 04:31.561
l was just thinking about our trip
to the Grand Canyon with Carl.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.681
( laughs)

04:35.860 --> 04:38.192
I don't remember that.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.603
No, you wouldn't.
You were just a baby.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.158
Besides, we never made it
past Fort Worth.

04:43.325 --> 04:46.692
No, you got sick. I never knew a baby
could throw up so much.

04:46.871 --> 04:48.577
Carl: lck.

04:48.747 --> 04:50.829
Yeah, ick.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.991
The doctor in Texas
said you'd live.

04:53.169 --> 04:55.911
Then we turned around
and drove home.

04:56.088 --> 04:58.750
Carl:
Thatsucks.

04:58.924 --> 04:59.913
No, it was a good trip.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.916
No, it was a good trip.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.925
The best.

05:04.096 --> 05:07.680
Can we go see it?
The Grand Canyon?

05:07.850 --> 05:09.932
I'd like to.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.218
Sophia:
I would too.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.432
Can we go?

05:14.607 --> 05:16.768
We'd never go without
you and your mom.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.433
That's a promise.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.954
Looks complicated.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.787
The trick is getting
all these pieces

05:35.961 --> 05:38.077
back together
the same way.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.836
I could clean yours,

05:40.007 --> 05:41.622
show you how.

05:50.059 --> 05:52.345
Oh, yeah.

05:53.437 --> 05:54.802
It's a sweet piece.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.936
It was a gift

05:57.107 --> 05:58.813
from my father.

05:58.984 --> 06:02.977
He gave it to me just before Amy
and I took off on our road trip.

06:04.782 --> 06:06.113
He said two girls
on their own

06:06.283 --> 06:08.774
should be able
to defend themselves.

06:08.953 --> 06:10.989
Smart man, your father.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.862
Look, it's a--

06:14.041 --> 06:16.373
it's a limited capacity.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.660
See? Only holds
seven rounds.

06:18.837 --> 06:21.089
Dale:
Oh, jeez.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.587
Aw, no.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.318
See a way through?

06:55.416 --> 06:58.203
Uh, maybe we should
just go back.

06:58.377 --> 07:01.540
- There's an interstate bypass--
- We can't spare the fuel.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.068
Jeez.

07:44.590 --> 07:47.047
Glenn:
Can we get through here?

07:48.052 --> 07:50.418
( clanks )

07:50.596 --> 07:52.803
(engine sputtering )

08:05.819 --> 08:07.434
I said it.
Didn't I say it?

08:07.613 --> 08:10.070
A thousand times.
Dead in the water.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.946
Problem, Dale?

08:12.117 --> 08:14.449
Just a small matter of being stuck
in the middle of nowhere

08:14.620 --> 08:16.326
with no hope of--

08:17.915 --> 08:19.780
okay, that was dumb.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.994
If you can't find
a radiator hose here...

08:22.169 --> 08:24.285
There's a whole bunch
of stuff we can find.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.954
I can siphon more fuel
from these cars for a start.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.838
- Maybe some water.
- Or food.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.091
This is a graveyard.

08:37.434 --> 08:40.301
I don't know how
I feel about this.

08:41.647 --> 08:42.636
All right, all right,
here we go.

08:42.815 --> 08:45.352
T-Dog: Come on, y'all.
Just look around,

08:45.526 --> 08:47.812
gather what you can.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.883
(flies buzzing )

09:18.350 --> 09:20.591
Kids, don't look.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.978
- Which one?
- The flathead.

09:26.150 --> 09:28.516
Radiator hose clamp
is always a flathead.

09:28.694 --> 09:31.026
Here, you do it.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.357
Learn something.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.157
(coughs)

10:26.960 --> 10:29.747
Ed never let me wear
nice things like this.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.414
We're gonna need clothes.

10:38.931 --> 10:40.512
Hey, Carl.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.468
Always within
my sight, okay?

10:43.602 --> 10:45.092
You too, Sophia.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.909
It's all good.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.757
Okay.

11:20.097 --> 11:22.338
All right.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.362
Come on.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.539
Glenn.

11:49.710 --> 11:52.076
Were we short on water?

11:56.633 --> 11:59.295
( laughs)

12:00.846 --> 12:02.177
Hey, save me some!

12:02.347 --> 12:04.212
It's like being baptized, man.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.531
Oh, Christ.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.470
Lori, under the cars.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.892
Carl, Sophia,
get down now.

13:33.772 --> 13:36.605
- Carl and Sophia. Sophia.
- Shh, shh. Get under.

13:42.114 --> 13:43.820
Ow.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.986
What?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.242
Shh.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.341
Oh, God!

14:20.819 --> 14:22.775
Shh, shh.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.620
( groans )

14:52.559 --> 14:55.801
(walkers moaning )

15:53.620 --> 15:55.952
(mumbling quietly)

16:00.627 --> 16:03.243
( snarls )

16:16.768 --> 16:18.929
( whispers )
Okay.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.152
-( piece clangs)
-(gaspS)

16:33.326 --> 16:34.941
Shit.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.361
( growls )

17:11.823 --> 17:14.314
- ( growls )
- ( screams )

17:55.075 --> 17:57.316
( crunches )

18:02.666 --> 18:04.702
(whimpering)

18:04.876 --> 18:07.709
( screams )

18:11.216 --> 18:13.673
(grunts)

18:17.097 --> 18:19.429
(sobbing )

18:19.599 --> 18:21.806
Shh.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.608
( cracks )

19:34.841 --> 19:37.127
(whimpering)

20:03.620 --> 20:06.487
- ( growls)
- ( sobbing )

20:09.459 --> 20:11.666
- ( whimpering)
-Shh, shh.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.082
( screams )

20:20.553 --> 20:21.884
(growling)

20:43.576 --> 20:45.441
(grunts)

20:48.957 --> 20:50.822
Lori.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.037
- There's two walkers after my baby.
- Shh, shh.

21:30.373 --> 21:32.489
( panting )

21:34.711 --> 21:36.542
-(gasp5)
-Shh,shh!

21:36.713 --> 21:38.920
- Are you all right? Are you okay?
- Shoot them!

21:39.090 --> 21:40.546
No. No!

21:40.717 --> 21:42.253
Those walkers on the road
would hear it.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.418
Then it wouldn't be just two,
it'd be hundreds.

21:44.596 --> 21:46.086
Come here.
Come on.

21:53.855 --> 21:55.561
All right,
just hold here.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.472
You stay there.
Wait.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.902
( splashes )
Come on.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.364
Sophia, you have
to do exactly as I say.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.241
Hide in there.
Squeeze in tight.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.277
- l'll draw them away from you.
- No, no, don't leave me.

22:11.456 --> 22:13.242
Listen, listen,
listen, listen.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.407
They don't get winded.
I do.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.200
I can only deal
with them one at a time.

22:17.378 --> 22:18.834
I wouldn't be able
to protect you.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.747
This is how we both survive.
You understand?

22:21.925 --> 22:24.291
Okay?
Go, go, go, go.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.588
If I don't make it back,
run back to the highway,

22:29.766 --> 22:31.802
back to the others
straight the way we came.

22:31.976 --> 22:34.433
Keep the sun
on your left shoulder.

22:40.318 --> 22:41.774
Come on!

22:43.655 --> 22:46.362
You ugly son of a bitch.
Come on!

22:54.707 --> 22:56.663
Come on!

22:56.834 --> 22:58.665
Come on!

22:59.754 --> 23:01.665
(grunts)

23:08.179 --> 23:10.135
Come on!

23:40.169 --> 23:41.909
(grunts)

23:44.424 --> 23:46.460
(grunting)

24:06.613 --> 24:07.602
(grunts)

24:10.450 --> 24:12.065
Sure this is the spot?

24:12.243 --> 24:14.620
I left her right here.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.574
I drew the walkers way off
in that direction up the creek.

24:17.749 --> 24:21.333
Without a paddle--
seems where we've landed.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.709
She was gone by the time
I got back here.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.587
I figured she just took off
and ran back to the group.

24:26.758 --> 24:28.669
I told her go that way

24:28.843 --> 24:30.754
and keep the sun
on her left shoulder.

24:32.889 --> 24:34.971
Hey, Short Round,
why don't you step off to one side?

24:35.141 --> 24:36.472
You're mucking up the trail.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.008
Assuming she knows
her left from her right.

24:38.186 --> 24:39.926
Shane, she understood me fine.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.015
Shane:
Kid's tired and scared, man.

24:42.190 --> 24:43.851
She had her a close call
with two walkers.

24:44.025 --> 24:45.811
Got to wonder how much
of what you said stuck.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.146
Got clear prints right here.

24:48.321 --> 24:50.482
She did like you said,
headed back to the highway.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.524
- Let's spread out, make our way back.
- She couldn't have gone far.

24:55.411 --> 24:57.072
Hey, we gonna find her.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.111
She'll be tuckered out
hiding in a bush somewhere.

25:08.549 --> 25:10.710
She was doing just fine
till right here.

25:10.885 --> 25:13.467
All she had to do
was keep going.

25:13.638 --> 25:15.845
She veered off that way.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.630
Glenn:
Why would she do that?

25:17.809 --> 25:20.972
Maybe she saw something
that spooked her, made her run off.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.681
A walker?

25:22.855 --> 25:24.937
I don't see
any other footprints.

25:25.108 --> 25:26.473
Just hers.

25:26.651 --> 25:29.438
So what do we do?
All of us press on?

25:29.612 --> 25:32.149
No, better if you and Glenn
get back up to the highway.

25:32.323 --> 25:34.063
People are gonna
start panicking.

25:34.242 --> 25:37.154
Let them know we're on her
trail doing everything we can.

25:37.328 --> 25:39.159
But most of all,
keep everybody calm.

25:39.330 --> 25:40.991
I'll keep 'em
busy scavenging cars.

25:41.165 --> 25:43.781
Think up a few other chores.
I'll keep 'em occupied.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.076
Come on.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.216
(engine idling)

25:54.387 --> 25:56.423
( revs )

26:16.242 --> 26:19.359
Why aren't we all out there looking?
Why are we moving cars?

26:19.537 --> 26:21.619
We have to clear enough
room so I can get the RV

26:21.789 --> 26:23.199
turned around as soon
as it's running.

26:23.374 --> 26:25.660
Now that we have fuel
we can double back

26:25.835 --> 26:28.451
to a bypass that Glenn
flagged on the map.

26:28.629 --> 26:31.120
Going back's going to be easier
than trying to get through this mess.

26:31.299 --> 26:33.290
We're not going anywhere
till my daughter gets back.

26:33.468 --> 26:35.208
Hey, that goes
without saying.

26:35.386 --> 26:38.048
Rick and Daryl,
they're on it, okay?

26:38.222 --> 26:41.259
- Just a matter of time.
- Can't be soon enough for me.

26:41.434 --> 26:44.096
I'm still freaked out from
that herd that passed us by,

26:44.270 --> 26:46.727
- or whatever you'd call it.
- Yeah, what was that?

26:46.898 --> 26:48.354
All of them just
marching along like that.

26:48.524 --> 26:52.016
A herd.
That sounds about right.

26:52.195 --> 26:54.902
We've seen it. It's like the night
camp got attacked.

26:55.072 --> 26:57.404
Just a wandering pack,
only fewer.

26:57.575 --> 26:58.610
( exhales )
Okay.

26:58.618 --> 26:59.073
( exhales )
Okay.

26:59.243 --> 27:01.825
Come on, people.
We still got a lot to do.

27:01.996 --> 27:04.078
Let's stay on it.
Let's go, come on.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.960
Tracks are gone.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.254
No, they're faint,

27:21.432 --> 27:23.423
but they ain't gone.

27:23.601 --> 27:25.262
She came through here.

27:25.436 --> 27:27.097
How can you tell?

27:27.271 --> 27:29.432
I don't see anything.
Dirt, grass.

27:29.607 --> 27:31.939
You want a lesson in tracking
or you want to find that girl

27:32.109 --> 27:34.145
and get our ass off
that interstate?

28:38.426 --> 28:40.041
(grunts)

28:42.555 --> 28:44.341
( shrieks )

28:55.526 --> 28:57.983
- Shane.
- Carl, what happened?

28:58.154 --> 29:00.190
Mom, I found something cool.

29:00.364 --> 29:02.195
Shane, check it out.

29:03.701 --> 29:05.362
It's an arsenal.

29:05.536 --> 29:07.276
That's cool, bud.
Go give 'em to Dale.

29:07.455 --> 29:09.286
Check this one out.

29:09.457 --> 29:11.664
Whoa, it's a hatchet.

29:11.834 --> 29:14.041
- Be careful. Don't play with those.
- They're really sharp.

29:14.211 --> 29:17.044
- What did I just say?
- Can I keep one?

29:17.214 --> 29:19.626
- Are you crazy?
- No way.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.792
Shane. Shane, tell her
to let me keep one.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.297
Hey, man, go give them
all to Dale now. Go.

29:37.401 --> 29:40.234
- What was that?
- What was what?

29:40.404 --> 29:43.066
The way you blew him offjust now.
You crushed him.

29:49.747 --> 29:52.238
I don't believe you.
You're giving me the cold shoulder?

29:52.416 --> 29:54.031
Isn't that what you want?

29:54.210 --> 29:56.917
Weren't you the one who said stay
the hell away from him and you?

29:57.088 --> 29:59.454
You forget what happened
at the CDC?

29:59.632 --> 30:02.465
Your little meltdown
in the rec room slip your mind?

30:02.635 --> 30:04.466
- When you tried--
- When I tried to what?

30:04.637 --> 30:06.252
What do you
think that was?

30:06.430 --> 30:09.763
I think it is pretty plain
what that was.

30:09.934 --> 30:12.971
A mistake.
One that I admit to.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.932
l have a few mistakes
under my belt, Lori.

30:16.107 --> 30:18.268
So do you.

30:18.442 --> 30:20.774
No debate there.

30:20.945 --> 30:23.607
But, Shane, we need
to stop this.

30:23.781 --> 30:25.897
Why do you think
I'm prepping my new ride?

30:27.493 --> 30:29.404
I'm leaving.

30:29.578 --> 30:31.443
Leaving?

30:31.622 --> 30:33.533
As in gone for good.

30:33.708 --> 30:37.621
Gonna quietly slip away
first chance I get.

30:40.131 --> 30:41.917
(starts engine)

30:42.091 --> 30:44.047
Radio: The Emergency Alert System
has been activated.

30:44.218 --> 30:47.255
The Office of Civil Defense has issued
the following message:

30:47.430 --> 30:49.637
normal broadcasting
will cease immediately.

30:49.807 --> 30:52.799
- This is a civil emergency.
- Is that a local signal?

30:52.977 --> 30:55.434
It's got to be within
50 miles of here.

30:55.604 --> 30:58.186
Avoid anyone infected at all costs.
Remain calm.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.733
Help is on the way.

30:59.900 --> 31:02.642
The Emergency Alert System
has been activated.

31:02.820 --> 31:04.230
The Office of Civil Defense--

31:04.405 --> 31:06.487
- ( turns off radio )
- Asshole.

31:06.657 --> 31:09.945
Okay, let's get back to work.

31:22.131 --> 31:24.588
( leaves rustling )

31:56.207 --> 31:59.574
- ( whistles )
- ( roars )

32:12.890 --> 32:14.926
Sophia!

32:22.650 --> 32:23.981
What are you looking for?

32:24.151 --> 32:26.733
Skin under the fingernails.

32:32.868 --> 32:34.733
lt fed recently.

32:40.543 --> 32:43.706
There's flesh
caught in its teeth.

32:44.922 --> 32:47.254
Yeah, what kind of flesh?

32:48.926 --> 32:50.917
Only one way
to know for sure.

32:56.767 --> 32:58.758
Here, I'll do it.

32:58.936 --> 33:00.642
How many kills you skin
and gut in your life?

33:00.813 --> 33:03.725
Anyway, mine is sharper.

33:06.569 --> 33:08.605
(grunts)

33:18.956 --> 33:20.867
(grunts)

33:39.852 --> 33:41.934
Now comes the bad part.

33:43.689 --> 33:46.476
( groans )

33:56.660 --> 33:58.742
( groans )

34:00.414 --> 34:02.996
( panting )

34:11.634 --> 34:14.626
Yeah, hoss had a big meal
not long ago.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.930
| feel it in there.

34:20.851 --> 34:22.512
( groans )

34:25.564 --> 34:27.805
- Here's the gut bag.
- I got this.

34:33.197 --> 34:35.483
( panting )

34:37.826 --> 34:39.737
( groans )

34:49.797 --> 34:52.709
This gross bastard had himself
a woodchuck for lunch.

34:56.178 --> 34:58.794
- At least we know.
- At least we know.

35:13.404 --> 35:16.396
It's late.
Gonna be dark soon.

35:17.992 --> 35:19.948
They'll find her.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.783
Where's my gun?

35:29.962 --> 35:31.577
You have no right
to take it.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.416
You don't need that
just now, do you?

35:33.590 --> 35:35.091
My father gave it to me.
It's mine.

35:35.259 --> 35:37.875
I can hold onto it for you.

35:38.053 --> 35:39.884
Or you can give it
back to me.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.795
Everything cool?

35:41.974 --> 35:43.259
No, I want my gun back.

35:43.434 --> 35:46.096
I don't think
it's a good idea right now.

35:46.270 --> 35:48.306
Why not?

35:50.357 --> 35:52.097
I'm not comfortable with it.

35:52.276 --> 35:54.107
( scoffs )

35:57.573 --> 35:59.609
The truth is,

35:59.783 --> 36:02.946
less guns we have floating
around camp the better.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.405
You turning over your weapon?

36:04.580 --> 36:06.821
( chuckles )
No.

36:06.999 --> 36:09.832
But I'm trained in its use.

36:10.002 --> 36:12.459
That's what the rest of y'all
need is proper training.

36:12.629 --> 36:15.792
But until that time I think it's best if
Dale keeps them all accounted for.

36:15.966 --> 36:18.082
(scoffs)
Uh-huh.

36:22.014 --> 36:23.595
Mind telling me
what that's about?

36:23.766 --> 36:25.302
Oh, God, they're back.

36:28.979 --> 36:30.480
You didn't find her?

36:30.647 --> 36:32.228
Her trail went cold.

36:32.399 --> 36:34.139
We'll pick it up again
at first light.

36:34.318 --> 36:36.775
You can't leave my daughter
out there on her own

36:36.945 --> 36:38.526
to spend the night
alone in the woods.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.437
Out in the dark's no good.

36:40.616 --> 36:43.153
We'd just be tripping over ourselves.
More people'd get lost.

36:43.327 --> 36:45.818
But she's 12. She can't be out
there on her own.

36:45.996 --> 36:47.861
- You didn't find anything?
- I know this is hard.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.325
But I'm asking you
not to panic.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.706
We know she was out there.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.412
And we tracked her
for a while.

36:52.586 --> 36:54.918
We have to make this
an organized effort.

36:55.089 --> 36:56.795
Daryl knows the woods
better than anybody.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.377
I've asked him to oversee this.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.837
Is that blood?

37:02.012 --> 37:03.843
( breathing heavily )

37:04.014 --> 37:07.131
- We took down a walker.
- Walker? Oh, my God.

37:07.309 --> 37:10.016
There was no sign it was
ever anywhere near Sophia.

37:10.187 --> 37:12.519
Andrea:
How can you know that?

37:16.360 --> 37:19.193
We cut the son
of a bitch open, made sure.

37:22.533 --> 37:25.024
Oh, God.

37:29.832 --> 37:33.495
How could you just leave her
out there to begin with?

37:35.003 --> 37:36.789
How could you
just leave her?

37:36.964 --> 37:38.829
Those two walkers
were on us.

37:39.007 --> 37:41.919
I had to draw them off.

37:42.094 --> 37:43.379
It was her best chance.

37:43.554 --> 37:44.885
Sounds like he didn't
have a choice, Carol.

37:45.055 --> 37:47.637
How was she supposed to
find her way back on her own?

37:47.808 --> 37:50.800
She'sjust a child.
She'sjust a child.

37:50.978 --> 37:54.562
It was my only option.
The only choice I could make.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.561
I'm sure nobody
doubts that.

38:04.283 --> 38:06.990
My little girl got left
in the woods.

38:41.111 --> 38:42.612
Everybody takes a weapon.

38:42.779 --> 38:44.610
These aren't the kind
of weapons we need.

38:44.781 --> 38:47.363
- What about the guns?
- We've been over that.

38:47.534 --> 38:49.650
Daryl, Rick and l
are carrying.

38:49.828 --> 38:52.615
We can't have people popping off
rounds every time a tree rustles.

38:52.789 --> 38:54.325
It's not the trees
I'm worried about.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.536
Say somebody fires
at the wrong moment,

38:56.710 --> 38:58.075
a herd happens
to be passing by.

38:58.253 --> 38:59.993
See, then it's game over
for all of us.

39:00.172 --> 39:01.787
So you need
to get over it.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.541
Daryl: The idea is to take the creek
up about five miles,

39:05.719 --> 39:07.459
turn around and come
back down the other side.

39:07.638 --> 39:09.469
Chances are
she'll be by the creek.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.096
It's her only landmark.

39:11.266 --> 39:12.802
Stay quiet and stay sharp.

39:12.976 --> 39:15.843
Keep space between you but always
stay within sight of each other.

39:16.021 --> 39:18.057
Shane:
Everybody assemble your packs.

39:18.232 --> 39:20.223
Dale, keep on those repairs.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.231
We've got to get
this RV ready to move.

39:22.402 --> 39:25.109
We won't stay here a minute
longer than we have to.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.566
Good luck out there.

39:27.741 --> 39:29.777
Bring Sophia back.

39:29.952 --> 39:31.488
Keep an eye on Carl
while we're gone.

39:31.662 --> 39:34.324
I'm going with you.

39:34.498 --> 39:36.989
You need people, right?
To cover as much ground as possible.

39:37.167 --> 39:38.873
( groans )

39:40.671 --> 39:43.253
Your call.
I can't always be the bad guy.

39:45.217 --> 39:47.173
Well, he has all of you
to look after him.

39:47.344 --> 39:49.426
I'd say he's in good hands.

39:50.472 --> 39:52.929
Okay. Okay.

39:53.100 --> 39:55.341
But always within our sight,
no exceptions.

40:05.571 --> 40:08.859
Andrea, I'm begging you.
Don't put me in this position.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.988
I'm not going out
there without my gun.

40:11.159 --> 40:12.660
I'll even say please.

40:14.621 --> 40:15.997
I'm doing this for you.

40:16.164 --> 40:18.120
No, Dale, you're doing
it for you.

40:18.292 --> 40:20.954
You need to stop.
What do you think's gonna happen?

40:21.128 --> 40:22.243
I'm gonna stick it in my mouth

40:22.421 --> 40:24.036
and pull the trigger the moment
you hand it to me?

40:24.214 --> 40:26.375
Dale:
I know you're angry at me.

40:26.550 --> 40:28.381
That much is clear.

40:28.552 --> 40:30.838
But if| hadn't
done what I did,

40:31.013 --> 40:33.004
you'd be dead now.

40:33.181 --> 40:34.261
Jenner gave us an option.

40:34.433 --> 40:36.719
- I chose to stay.
- You chose suicide.

40:36.893 --> 40:38.679
So what's that to you?
You barely know me.

40:38.854 --> 40:41.561
- I know Amy's death devastated you.
- Keep her out of this.

40:41.732 --> 40:44.269
This is not about Amy.
This is about us.

40:44.443 --> 40:47.901
And if I decided that I had
nothing left to live for,

40:48.071 --> 40:49.902
who the hell are you
to tell me otherwise?

40:50.073 --> 40:52.689
To force my hand like that?

40:52.868 --> 40:55.735
- I saved your life.
- No, Dale.

40:55.912 --> 40:58.073
I saved yours.
You forced that on me.

40:58.248 --> 41:00.079
I didn't want
your blood on my hands

41:00.250 --> 41:02.036
and that is the only reason
I left that building.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.952
What did you expect?
What, I'd have some kind of epiphany?

41:05.130 --> 41:07.371
Some life-affirming catharsis?

41:07.549 --> 41:10.211
Maybe just a little gratitude.

41:10.385 --> 41:11.841
Gratitude?

41:12.012 --> 41:14.298
I wanted to die my way,

41:14.473 --> 41:16.589
not torn apart
by drooling freaks.

41:16.767 --> 41:18.974
That was my choice.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.726
You took that
away from me, Dale.

41:21.897 --> 41:24.013
- But--
- But you know better?

41:26.610 --> 41:29.192
All I wanted after my sister
died was to get out

41:29.363 --> 41:31.945
of this endless horrific nightmare
we live every day.

41:32.115 --> 41:34.697
I wasn't hurting
anyone else.

41:34.868 --> 41:37.029
You took my choice
away, Dale.

41:37.204 --> 41:41.197
And you expect gratitude?

41:48.006 --> 41:50.088
I don't know what to say.

41:51.677 --> 41:53.633
I'm not your little girl.

41:53.804 --> 41:57.012
I'm not your wife. And lam sure
as hell not your problem.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.924
That's all there is to say.

42:36.513 --> 42:38.003
Shane, look.

42:38.181 --> 42:40.593
Dad said I could carry it and Mom
said as long as l was--

42:40.767 --> 42:43.679
Keep it down.
We're looking for Sophia.

42:43.854 --> 42:45.310
You need to focus
on the task.

42:48.942 --> 42:51.558
- Got to keep up.
- I am.

42:53.321 --> 42:56.404
- You okay?
- I think Shane's mad at me.

42:56.575 --> 42:58.987
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

42:59.161 --> 43:01.322
No, honey, I promise you.

43:01.496 --> 43:05.080
He's just-- he's worried about
Sophia, that's all.

43:26.229 --> 43:27.890
Shane:
She could be in there.

43:28.064 --> 43:30.225
Could be a whole bunch
of things in there.

44:09.231 --> 44:10.596
Carol.

44:15.278 --> 44:17.655
Call out softly.

44:17.823 --> 44:20.781
If she's in there, yours is the first
voice she should hear.

44:22.953 --> 44:25.490
Sophia, sweetie,

44:25.664 --> 44:27.529
are you in there?

44:27.707 --> 44:29.993
Sophia, it's Mommy.

44:30.168 --> 44:32.750
Sophia.
We're all here, baby.

44:32.921 --> 44:34.912
lt's Mommy.

44:42.806 --> 44:45.138
( unzipping slowly)

44:50.313 --> 44:52.474
(coughs)

45:02.367 --> 45:04.608
( coughs, gags)

45:10.917 --> 45:13.294
Daryl?

45:15.547 --> 45:17.629
Daryl?

45:23.680 --> 45:25.170
It ain't her.

45:27.726 --> 45:29.512
- What's in there?
- Some guy.

45:29.686 --> 45:32.393
Did what Jenner said.
Opted out.

45:32.564 --> 45:35.180
Ain't that what
he called it?

45:36.818 --> 45:39.025
(church bells ringing)

45:48.705 --> 45:50.411
What direction?

45:50.582 --> 45:53.540
I think that way.
I'm pretty sure.

45:53.710 --> 45:55.246
Damn, it's hard
to tell out here.

45:55.420 --> 45:56.956
If we hear them,
maybe Sophia does too.

45:57.130 --> 45:58.791
Someone's ringing those bells,
maybe calling others.

45:58.965 --> 46:00.375
Or signaling
that they found her.

46:00.550 --> 46:03.087
She could be ringing
them herself. Come on.

46:09.935 --> 46:12.517
T-Dog: Ain't you supposed to be
fixing that radiator?

46:12.687 --> 46:14.018
What if they come
back with Sophia

46:14.189 --> 46:16.054
and Rick wants to
move on right away?

46:17.734 --> 46:20.601
- I had it fixed yesterday.
- What?

46:20.779 --> 46:23.111
What was all that rubbing
and sanding for then?

46:23.281 --> 46:25.943
- That just bullshit?
- Yeah, that's one word.

46:26.117 --> 46:28.699
Another word
would be pantomime--

46:28.870 --> 46:30.952
just for show.

46:31.122 --> 46:33.955
No one else needs
to know that.

46:35.669 --> 46:37.455
Pantomime.

46:37.629 --> 46:39.711
If the others know
we're mobile,

46:39.881 --> 46:42.122
they'll want to mobilize
and move on.

46:42.300 --> 46:44.541
So you don't think
they're gonna find Sophia, that it?

46:44.719 --> 46:46.801
I'm just guarding
against the worst.

46:46.972 --> 46:49.133
Sooner or later,
if she's not found,

46:49.307 --> 46:51.764
people will start
doing math.

46:51.935 --> 46:56.304
I want to hold off
the needs-of-the-many-

46:56.481 --> 46:59.973
versus-the-needs-of-the-few
arguments as long as I can.

47:01.987 --> 47:05.070
That is one
tricky hose, huh?

47:05.240 --> 47:07.322
Very.

47:17.502 --> 47:20.494
That can't be it.
Got no steeple, no bells.

47:20.672 --> 47:23.505
Rick.

47:48.783 --> 47:51.399
(snarling )

48:15.060 --> 48:16.891
(grunts)

48:24.986 --> 48:26.897
( kissing sounds)

48:30.825 --> 48:33.202
(grunting)

48:36.581 --> 48:39.072
( panting )

48:44.714 --> 48:47.421
Sophia!

48:49.511 --> 48:52.298
Yo, JC,
you taking requests?

48:52.472 --> 48:55.555
I'm telling you, it's the wrong church.
It's got no steeple, Rick.

48:55.725 --> 48:57.886
There's no steeple.

48:58.061 --> 49:01.053
(bells ringing)

49:10.281 --> 49:11.862
(ringing stops)

49:12.033 --> 49:15.400
A timer.
It's on a timer.

49:18.623 --> 49:21.035
I'm gonna go
back in for a bit.

49:38.643 --> 49:39.974
(sighs)

49:39.978 --> 49:40.467
(sighs)

49:46.651 --> 49:48.312
Lori:
Are you really leaving?

49:48.486 --> 49:50.147
Shane: Don't you think
it's best for all of us?

49:50.321 --> 49:53.438
I think it is.
What made you decide?

49:53.616 --> 49:56.824
Gotta back away. Just trying to be
the good guy here, Lori,

49:56.995 --> 49:59.737
even if you don't see it.
None of this was intended.

49:59.914 --> 50:02.781
I hope you know that.

50:02.959 --> 50:06.668
Well, don't matter.
As long as I said it.

50:06.838 --> 50:09.750
You're just gonna disappear?
You're not even gonna tell Rick?

50:09.924 --> 50:11.710
He'd only try to stop me.
No, that's on you.

50:11.885 --> 50:14.046
You tell him what you want.
Or tell him nothing at all.

50:14.220 --> 50:15.835
- You're his wife.
- And Carl?

50:16.014 --> 50:17.424
We dragged him into this.

50:17.599 --> 50:19.180
- I love Carl.
- He thinks you hate him.

50:19.350 --> 50:21.341
I'm trying to put some distance.
I'm trying to make this easier.

50:21.519 --> 50:23.555
This ain't easy on any
of us, least of all me.

50:23.730 --> 50:25.595
I'm the one who loses you.

50:58.056 --> 50:59.762
Father, forgive me.

51:01.476 --> 51:03.888
I don't deserve Your mercy.

51:05.563 --> 51:09.351
I prayed for safe passage
from Atlanta and You provided.

51:09.525 --> 51:12.562
I prayed for Ed
to be punished

51:12.737 --> 51:14.238
for laying his hands on me

51:14.405 --> 51:17.568
and for looking
at his own daughter

51:17.742 --> 51:21.200
with whatever sickness
was growing in his soul.

51:21.371 --> 51:24.408
I prayed You'd put
a stop to it,

51:26.334 --> 51:28.245
give me a chance
to raise her right,

51:28.419 --> 51:29.875
help her not
make my mistakes.

51:30.046 --> 51:32.833
She's so fearful.

51:34.759 --> 51:37.091
She's so young in her way.

51:37.262 --> 51:40.095
She hasn't had a chance.

51:46.562 --> 51:49.304
Praying for Ed's death
was a sin.

51:51.276 --> 51:56.236
Please, don't let this
be my punishment.

51:57.282 --> 52:00.570
Let her be safe,

52:00.743 --> 52:03.120
alive and safe.

52:04.789 --> 52:07.075
Please, Lord.

52:07.250 --> 52:10.287
Punish me however You want,

52:11.921 --> 52:14.458
but show mercy on her.

52:31.232 --> 52:32.893
I'm coming with you.

52:33.067 --> 52:34.477
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

52:34.652 --> 52:36.643
I'm not stupid
and I'm certainly not deaf.

52:36.821 --> 52:39.312
- Look, I don't know the story.
- There is no story.

52:39.490 --> 52:41.742
Fine, I don't care. Don't confuse me
with someone who does.

52:41.909 --> 52:43.649
Look, all I care about
is getting out of here

52:43.828 --> 52:46.410
as far away as I can,
like you.

52:46.581 --> 52:48.287
We're gonna sail off into
the sunset together?

52:48.458 --> 52:49.789
We gonna hold hands?

52:49.959 --> 52:51.335
I'm not asking you
to go steady, Shane.

52:51.502 --> 52:55.836
I'm asking for a ride, a chance
to start over somewhere else.

52:56.007 --> 52:58.339
You observe
this group lately?

52:58.509 --> 53:01.626
l have. I see two people
who don't belong.

53:01.804 --> 53:03.544
We're the odd men out.

53:03.723 --> 53:06.089
Between the two of us,
we make a great third wheel.

53:06.267 --> 53:09.509
So what?
Say we do, we just run off.

53:09.687 --> 53:12.144
What's in it for me except for
the extra ass I got to cover?

53:12.315 --> 53:14.772
The chance to do something
for someone else.

53:14.942 --> 53:18.480
- Yeah.
- And a door that swings both ways.

53:18.654 --> 53:20.610
Put a gun in my hand,
l'll cover your ass, too.

53:20.782 --> 53:22.647
( scoffs )

53:24.202 --> 53:25.908
Think it over.

53:27.497 --> 53:29.954
(sighs)

53:33.044 --> 53:35.160
Got to move here, man.

53:35.338 --> 53:38.171
These people are spent.

53:38.341 --> 53:40.582
There's only so many
hours of daylight left.

53:40.760 --> 53:43.251
- We still got a long way back.
- I can't stop yet.

53:43.429 --> 53:44.965
We still got
a lot of ground to cover,

53:45.139 --> 53:46.515
whole other side
of the creek bed.

53:46.682 --> 53:48.092
So we search that
on the way back.

53:48.267 --> 53:50.474
She would have heard those
church bells. She could be nearby.

53:50.645 --> 53:53.762
- She could be a lot of things.
- I can't go back.

53:53.940 --> 53:55.896
Her being out here
is my fault.

53:56.067 --> 53:57.557
That's great.

53:57.735 --> 53:59.726
Now they got you
doubting yourself, huh?

53:59.904 --> 54:02.020
What about you?
You doubt me?

54:02.198 --> 54:04.940
Hey, we can assign
all kinds of blame.

54:05.118 --> 54:07.074
This means something,
finding her.

54:07.245 --> 54:09.031
Oh, man.

54:09.205 --> 54:12.697
It would be the miracle we need.
We can't give up.

54:12.875 --> 54:14.911
(sighs)

54:15.086 --> 54:16.576
Mmm.

54:18.339 --> 54:20.830
Ahem.

54:21.008 --> 54:24.045
Y'all gonna follow the creek bed back.
Okay, Daryl, you're in charge.

54:24.220 --> 54:26.176
Me and Rick, we're just
gonna hang back,

54:26.347 --> 54:28.554
search this area another hour
or so just to be thorough.

54:28.724 --> 54:31.306
You're splitting us up.
You sure?

54:31.477 --> 54:33.593
Yeah, we'll catch up to you.

54:33.771 --> 54:35.727
Carl:
I want to stay, too.

54:37.191 --> 54:38.897
l'm her friend.

54:45.324 --> 54:48.111
- Just be careful, okay?
- I will.

54:48.286 --> 54:51.449
When did you start
growing up?

54:57.795 --> 54:59.205
Rick:
I'll be along soon enough.

55:03.259 --> 55:05.250
Here, take this.

55:05.428 --> 55:07.043
Remember how to use it?

55:07.221 --> 55:09.177
I'm not taking your gun
and leaving you unarmed.

55:09.348 --> 55:12.511
Here, got a spare.
Take it.

55:27.158 --> 55:29.649
Give me a minute?

55:31.537 --> 55:33.198
Come on.

55:47.011 --> 55:49.502
I don't know if you're
looking at me with what?

55:49.680 --> 55:52.171
(sighs)

55:52.350 --> 55:54.591
Sadness?

55:54.769 --> 55:57.010
Scorn?

55:57.188 --> 56:00.180
Pity?

56:00.358 --> 56:03.350
Love?

56:03.528 --> 56:04.938
(sighs)

56:05.112 --> 56:07.569
Maybe it's just indifference.

56:14.372 --> 56:17.489
I guess you already know
I'm not much of a believer.

56:17.667 --> 56:20.659
I guess I just chose to
put my faith elsewhere.

56:22.672 --> 56:24.879
My family, mostly.

56:25.049 --> 56:27.506
My friends.

56:27.677 --> 56:30.510
My job.

56:34.850 --> 56:36.841
The thing is, we--

56:41.899 --> 56:45.187
I could use a little something
to help keep us going.

56:47.697 --> 56:49.528
Some kind of...

56:49.699 --> 56:51.690
acknowledgement.

56:51.867 --> 56:54.904
Some indication I'm doing
the right thing.

56:56.664 --> 56:59.371
You don't know
how hard that is to know.

57:07.633 --> 57:09.874
Well, maybe you do.

57:19.020 --> 57:21.261
Hey look, I don't need
all the answers.

57:21.439 --> 57:23.805
Just a little nudge.
A sign.

57:27.194 --> 57:29.685
Any sign will do.

57:39.081 --> 57:42.164
- Get what you needed?
- Guess I'll find out.

57:59.769 --> 58:01.725
Carol:
So this is it?

58:01.896 --> 58:03.602
This the whole plan?

58:03.773 --> 58:06.264
Daryl: I guess the plan is
to whittle us down

58:06.442 --> 58:08.057
into smaller
and smaller groups.

58:08.235 --> 58:10.191
Carrying knives
and pointy sticks.

58:10.363 --> 58:11.944
| see you have a gun.

58:12.114 --> 58:14.491
Why, you want it?

58:14.659 --> 58:16.945
Here, take it.

58:18.704 --> 58:20.945
I'm sick of the looks
you're giving me.

58:24.919 --> 58:26.659
All of you.

58:30.466 --> 58:33.128
Honey, I can't imagine
what you're going through.

58:33.302 --> 58:34.337
And I would do
anything to stop it.

58:34.512 --> 58:36.423
But you have got to stop
blaming Rick.

58:36.597 --> 58:39.259
It is in your face
every time you look at him.

58:39.433 --> 58:42.800
When Sophia ran he didn't
hesitate, did he?

58:42.978 --> 58:44.388
Not for a second.

58:44.563 --> 58:47.555
I don't know that any of us would
have gone after her the way he did

58:47.733 --> 58:50.019
or made the hard decisions
that he had to make

58:50.194 --> 58:53.277
or that anybody could have
done it any differently.

58:57.368 --> 58:59.450
Anybody?

59:07.420 --> 59:10.082
Y'all look to him and then you blame
him when he's not perfect.

59:10.256 --> 59:12.622
If you think you can do this
without him, go right ahead.

59:12.800 --> 59:14.631
Nobody is stopping you.

59:26.480 --> 59:28.641
We should keep moving.

59:46.876 --> 59:49.242
( branches snapping )

1:00:42.181 --> 1:00:44.012
Shane.

1:01:22.096 --> 1:01:23.506
( soft snap )

1:01:53.168 --> 1:01:55.454
(gunshot)

1:01:58.883 --> 1:02:01.169
Oh, no. No.

1:02:01.343 --> 1:02:03.755
No, no, no, no!

1:02:12.354 --> 1:02:14.686
(theme music playing )
