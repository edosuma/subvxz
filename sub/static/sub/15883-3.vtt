- I've had that.

Dude, I was like, "What?
Is it racist? I don't even think..."

02:51.743 --> 02:54.439
He's like, "Think about it, man.
It's a bunch of white dudes

02:54.499 --> 02:56.861
that go to an island,
all these aborigines..."

02:56.944 --> 02:58.944

you <i>assume</i> that it's racist.

05:29.790 --> 05:33.595
The Ku Klux Klan?
Are you outside of your mind?

05:33.790 --> 05:36.414
That's traditional
country music imagery, man.

05:36.442 --> 05:38.942

something, man. I'm just gonna be frank.

that this song

06:05.879 --> 06:07.154
is not racist,

06:07.348 --> 06:10.794
 and it's impossible for you
to misinterpret it as such.

06:12.433 --> 06:16.076

Good evening,
my fellow Americans.

06:56.050 --> 06:58.341
With me, as always,
is my anger translator, Luther.

06:58.397 --> 07:00.730
- Hi.
- Now, after the last debate,

07:00.841 --> 07:04.098
I was criticized for...
not showing enough emotion.

07:04.236 --> 07:07.453
I should've been on that stage!
Oh, my God! Mitt!

07:07.510 --> 07:11.147
If I was a Siberian tiger,
your ass would've been Roy!

07:11.175 --> 07:12.758
Str-r-aight up!

07:12.925 --> 07:15.139
I was faulted for a lack of

07:15.222 --> 07:18.715
"pithy retorts"
or "zingers."

07:18.909 --> 07:20.481
But we can do better than that.

07:20.675 --> 07:24.313
Witty responses are not going
to resolve this nation's deficit.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.005
How you gonna fire
<i>Sesame Street</i> ?

07:27.061 --> 07:30.675
One of these mother[bleep]
already lives in a trash can! Zing!

07:30.731 --> 07:32.956
And a one-liner
is not going to solve

07:33.012 --> 07:34.646
the problems we have
with our tax code,

07:34.646 --> 07:38.166
which my opponent seems to have
entirely changed his position on.

07:38.249 --> 07:41.484
This mother[bleep]
gets more reboots than <i>Spider-Man</i>!

07:41.762 --> 07:43.169
And boom, goes the dynamite.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.366
I look forward to a debate
based on substance,

07:46.783 --> 07:48.922
- not on zingers.
- I got a Mormon zinger!

07:49.033 --> 07:50.807
"Take my wives, please!"

07:50.863 --> 07:53.750
Ooh-ho-ho, [bleep]!
I said "wives."

07:53.806 --> 07:55.468
Thank you,
and good night.

07:55.579 --> 07:58.216
This message brought to you
by the letter "Suck my"

07:58.216 --> 08:00.159
and the number "[bleep]."

08:00.187 --> 08:02.187
(Both) Ohh!

08:03.103 --> 08:05.103
(laughs)
Snap, America.

08:05.603 --> 08:07.150
Snap, indeed.

08:10.150 --> 08:12.876
All right, he knows I won't get dogs
because it's basically like, it's like

08:13.098 --> 08:15.412
- buying a new grandparent.
- Mm-hm.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.468
You know, you have to... you gotta
feed them, you gotta take 'em on walks.

08:19.801 --> 08:22.165
They will look at you in the eyes
while they're pooping.

08:25.388 --> 08:27.388
- I'm with you.
- They drool, you know.

08:28.249 --> 08:30.249
[bleep] forgetful as [bleep].

08:32.054 --> 08:35.285
All my dogs are shelter dogs
because purebread dogs

08:35.313 --> 08:36.674
are stupid.

08:36.731 --> 08:37.570
Yeah?

08:37.613 --> 08:41.198
When you mix them, you get a thing
that's commonly known as hybrid vigor.

08:41.587 --> 08:44.754
And what happens is
all the best qualities of both dogs

08:44.810 --> 08:48.145
go into the one dog.
Much like interracial people.

08:48.284 --> 08:50.284
(hisses, cheers and applause)

08:53.863 --> 08:55.728
(rapping)
Representing hybrid vigor.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.265
(laughs)

08:57.265 --> 08:58.821
That should be our rap group
right there.

08:58.849 --> 09:00.471
We should be "Hybrid Vigor."

09:00.499 --> 09:03.756
(rapping) Hybrid vigor
from a couple of hybrid [bleep].

09:03.812 --> 09:06.235
(laughs)
Let's get hard.

09:10.739 --> 09:12.429
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.

09:12.845 --> 09:15.963
Um, I made a really big decision
without consulting you.

09:16.074 --> 09:20.444
I went by a puppy rescue stand

09:20.499 --> 09:22.276
on University Avenue.

09:22.332 --> 09:24.219
I had to. I had to.

09:24.275 --> 09:26.768
- You got us a dog?
- Yeah, I did.

09:26.851 --> 09:28.851
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

09:30.129 --> 09:32.046
So, honey, I've gotta
tell you something, okay?

09:32.435 --> 09:34.917
These rescue dogs have had
some tough situations.

09:34.973 --> 09:36.610
- Oh.
- And a lot of them take on

09:36.647 --> 09:39.110
the personality of their owners.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.145
was owned by rapper Ice-T.

09:44.673 --> 09:46.673
- All right, little buddy, come on out.
- Aww.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.423
(gasps)

09:50.507 --> 09:54.307
Oh, hello,
my little darling. Oh!

09:54.466 --> 09:58.219

10:00.181 --> 10:01.985

10:02.013 --> 10:04.013
- A little testy.

10:04.291 --> 10:06.291
Nothin' ever been eathy
for me in my life.

10:06.430 --> 10:07.875
Now, hook me up
with a treat.

10:08.014 --> 10:09.677
- You want a treat, buddy?
- You want a treat?

10:09.707 --> 10:11.874
Is that what you want?
Here we go, sweetie. Here we go.

10:12.540 --> 10:15.229
Mm, yeah, that's a tathty-ass
treat right there.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.547
- Now give me the whole bag.
- Okay, one treat is enough.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.577
Bitch, was I talking to you?

10:21.658 --> 10:24.297
Give me the whole bag of treats
'cause I'm a treat killer

10:24.331 --> 10:26.575
and a mother[bleep] handful.

10:27.020 --> 10:29.882
- Somebody's grumpy today.
- Grumpy-wumpy.

10:30.410 --> 10:33.145
Lay my ass right up
on this comfortable-ass thofa.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.396
(laughs) I'm gonna sleep on this bitch
too, as a matter of fact.

10:36.509 --> 10:38.509

mother[bleep] and bitch?

10:38.594 --> 10:41.172

Raise your hand at me.

10:43.928 --> 10:47.817
Okay, um, I've got something

10:48.317 --> 10:51.849
Huh? Huh? You wanna play fetch? You
wanna play fetch? You like fetch, huh?

10:51.851 --> 10:53.516

It was an involutory reaction.

13:29.278 --> 13:30.909
(buzzing)

13:43.611 --> 13:45.527
We grew up in this area where...

13:45.890 --> 13:48.667
Okay, there was blaxploitation
in the '70s,

13:48.752 --> 13:51.560
and then when I was growing up
it got into this zone where,

13:51.617 --> 13:54.572
like, all of a sudden, the black guy
wasn't the cool guy

13:54.657 --> 13:56.657
- in the action movie anymore.
- Oh right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:56.714 --> 13:59.939
All of a sudden it was, like,
Mel Gibson was the [bleep] cool one.

14:00.068 --> 14:00.583
Right.

14:00.712 --> 14:02.730
And Danny Glover had
to be like, you know...

14:02.815 --> 14:05.533
The fuddy-duddy family man,
like "Get away from my daughter."

14:05.563 --> 14:06.835
- Right.
- You know what I mean?

14:07.053 --> 14:08.429
Do you remember that <i>Lethal Weapon</i> ?

14:08.486 --> 14:11.210
My man Mel Gibson
would come in on Danny Glover

14:11.350 --> 14:13.350
and my man would be standing
in the middle of the bathroom

14:13.435 --> 14:15.129
just embarrassing
all black people.

14:15.216 --> 14:16.739
(grunting)

14:16.824 --> 14:18.141
That's right.

14:18.198 --> 14:20.142
(imitating Mel Gibson)
Rodge, Rodge, what's going on?

14:20.172 --> 14:21.480
(imitating Danny Glover)
Stay there. Stay there.

14:21.565 --> 14:23.252
Okay, I'm not coming in, Rodge.
What's going on?

14:23.309 --> 14:26.262
Riggs, there's a bomb

14:26.458 --> 14:28.458
on my [bleep].

14:30.645 --> 14:33.010
Gmail is what I'm on now.
That's the uh...

14:33.150 --> 14:35.711
Okay, you get the most space
for attachments.

14:36.207 --> 14:37.630
- Anyway.
- Thank you.

14:37.742 --> 14:39.659
Feel free to hit me up
if you remember that number

14:39.716 --> 14:41.403
I noticed you ain't
write that down.

14:43.258 --> 14:46.750
Damn, damn, damn.
That girl was fly, right?

14:46.807 --> 14:48.180
(scoffs)
She all right.

14:48.214 --> 14:51.266
But did you see that Liam Neesons
movie with them wolves, though?

14:51.406 --> 14:53.950
The one with them big-assed
wolves and Liam Neesons in it?

14:54.009 --> 14:56.146
Man, Liam Neesons is my [bleep]!

14:56.286 --> 14:58.286
Oh, Liam Neesons straight
jacked up them wolves, man.

14:58.371 --> 15:00.233
Man, he [bleep]

15:00.270 --> 15:01.092
- Yeah.

15:01.149 --> 15:03.127
Hey, and don't get even get me
started on that one

15:03.157 --> 15:04.500
where they took his daughter.

15:04.585 --> 15:07.417
<i>Straight Tooken</i>,
starring Liam Neesons!

15:07.447 --> 15:11.266
Man, Liam Neesons on the phone like,
"I have a certain set of skills."

15:11.351 --> 15:12.843
Man, don't [bleep]
with Liam Neesons!

15:12.900 --> 15:14.729
No, don't even try and be Russian
around Liam Neesons.

15:14.786 --> 15:16.757
- He'll take your arm and... (screams)
- Put some fractures in it.

15:17.113 --> 15:18.914
They killing him, man.
And then...

15:18.999 --> 15:20.379
Oh, you see
the second one, though?

15:20.439 --> 15:22.439
In the second one,
the Russians come <i>after</i> him.

15:22.524 --> 15:24.187
And he [bleeps] them all up anyway.

15:24.217 --> 15:27.261
<i>Tooken 2</i>, starring
the incomparable Liam Neesons.

15:27.401 --> 15:28.689
- Mm-hm.
- That's my [bleep].

15:28.719 --> 15:30.498
- What about <i>Darkman</i>, though?
- No, uh.

15:30.943 --> 15:32.780
What about Liam Neesons
in some Darkman, though?

15:32.893 --> 15:35.735
- No, man. [bleep].
- What about <i>Darkman</i> ?

15:35.792 --> 15:38.071
When Liam Neesons' face
was changing up, man?

15:38.184 --> 15:40.932
Homie was straight face-changing.

15:41.017 --> 15:43.470
Now that's just Liam Neesons
acting right there, man.

15:43.527 --> 15:47.473
Straight up, I kid you not.
Academy-Award caliber. Classic Neesons.

15:47.520 --> 15:51.020
Man, come on, seriously. I mean, like,
Neesons already need to have a statue.

15:51.126 --> 15:53.126
- Liam Neesons ain't got no...
- He ain't got no statue...

15:53.183 --> 15:54.740
He ain't got a statue.
He ain't got a statue.

15:54.770 --> 15:56.804
No, no, no.

15:59.213 --> 16:01.883
The Oscar goes to
Liam Neesons, <i>Darkman</i>.

16:01.968 --> 16:03.833
- [bleep] face was changing.
- Mm-hm. Word!

16:03.879 --> 16:06.581
- How hard is that.
- It ain't hard. It's not hard at all.

16:06.611 --> 16:08.332
- Damn!
- It's stupid, man.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.030
Oh, oh! <i>Battleship</i>.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.170
Oooh!

16:16.322 --> 16:18.322

16:26.535 --> 16:29.345
Liam Neesons is my shiz-nit!

16:29.541 --> 16:31.036
Whoo!

16:31.342 --> 16:33.797
But do you know who I like
as much as Neesons, though?

16:33.910 --> 16:35.910
(scoffs) As much as Neesons?
Who?

16:36.078 --> 16:37.367
Bruce Willy.

16:37.950 --> 16:39.950
(screams)

16:43.797 --> 16:45.267
(screaming continues)

16:45.439 --> 16:47.297
Bruce Willy is my [bleep]!

16:47.437 --> 16:51.229
But what if they made a movie
with Liam Neesons and Bruce Willy?

16:51.314 --> 16:52.952
(grunting)

16:53.424 --> 16:56.244
- Neesons and Willy?
- Willy and Neesons.

16:56.246 --> 16:58.246
Harder, man. Harder!
(grunting)

- I don't know why.
- Oh, man.

17:11.646 --> 17:13.505
Why do we love

17:40.310 --> 17:44.209
Anybody lose their [bleep] iPad?
You lost it?

17:47.596 --> 17:50.129
- Oh, in Oakland.
- In Oakland. Okay.

17:50.214 --> 17:52.214
Oh, so you're never getting it
back then. (laughter)

17:53.289 --> 17:54.714
That's out of the question.

17:55.384 --> 17:58.071
My friend, you didn't lose it.
Your ass got jacked, my friend.

17:58.128 --> 17:59.483
That's right.

I'm the C.E.O. of Apple, Willis.
I'm not gonna do anything stupid.

18:14.089 --> 18:15.782
Please stop comparing me
to Steve Jobs!

18:15.839 --> 18:18.254
No, but nobody's comparing you
to Steve Jobs, okay?

18:18.367 --> 18:20.063
We just want you
to focus on the products.

18:20.176 --> 18:22.176
And please stick to the script.
Okay.

18:22.288 --> 18:23.769
You're on in three...

18:23.792 --> 18:26.243
They're gonna forget they ever heard
the name "Steve Jobs".

18:27.379 --> 18:29.379
What up, Apple people?
(cheers and applause)

18:30.851 --> 18:31.879
Yeah!

18:33.103 --> 18:34.075

Did Steve ever show you
that classified [bleep]?

20:17.131 --> 20:18.191
No, he didn't.

20:18.359 --> 20:20.359
You can't do that.
They haven't been tested yet.
