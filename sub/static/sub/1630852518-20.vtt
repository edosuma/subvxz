WEBVTT

00:27.193 --> 00:29.654


00:29.738 --> 00:32.449
It's 5:00 a.m., and Mega Mash Mayhem

00:32.532 --> 00:34.826
is finally releasing
limited-edition figurines

00:34.909 --> 00:37.078
of Captain Punch and Monkey Mash!

00:37.162 --> 00:40.915
My favorite characters
from my favorite video game of all time.

00:40.999 --> 00:44.627
Wait, I thought Melee Island
was your favorite video game.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.338
No, Melee Island is third.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.132
Tiny'mon Crash and Bash is second,

00:49.215 --> 00:51.176
even though Blast Ketchup
wants to destroy me,

00:51.259 --> 00:54.471
and Mega Mash Mayhem is number one!

00:57.640 --> 01:01.186
Sold out? They've only been on sale
for 13 seconds.

01:02.103 --> 01:04.731
-To the lab!

01:04.814 --> 01:06.858
Where my sisters' new 3D printer

01:06.941 --> 01:09.069
will just make the figurines for me.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.196
Uh, shouldn't we
ask them permission first,

01:11.279 --> 01:13.073
or to show us how to use it?

01:13.156 --> 01:16.326
You want me to wake them up
for something as small as figurines?

01:16.409 --> 01:18.536
That's rude, Dukey, and besides,

01:18.620 --> 01:21.289
how different can this thing be
from the one at school?

01:24.918 --> 01:28.171
Wait, did you type in
seven inches or seven feet?

01:28.254 --> 01:31.466
Does inch have the one thingy
after it, or two?

01:32.717 --> 01:35.929
"Interactive Movement on Command?"
What's that?

01:36.012 --> 01:39.140
That is…
<i>not</i> on the 3D printer at school.

01:42.185 --> 01:45.980
"Assembling artificial intelligence
and motor response?"

01:48.858 --> 01:50.693
Yeah, this might be a problem.

01:52.654 --> 01:55.824
Whoever that is, stop knocking!

01:55.907 --> 02:00.036
It's your loving brother,
and we might have a small problem.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.039
What small problem?

02:03.123 --> 02:05.416
Captain… Punch!

02:15.176 --> 02:19.722
I can't believe you used the 3D printer
without our permission.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.516
Well, I can't believe how easy it was

02:21.599 --> 02:24.018
to find the security password
in the hidden panel,

02:24.102 --> 02:26.271
and making every third digit irrelevant?

02:26.354 --> 02:28.064
So obvious.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.441
He's getting smarter.

02:30.525 --> 02:34.946
And luckily, everything 3D-printed
has a locator chip built in.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.575
And… relax.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.076
I think they were just scared.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.162
Captain Punch and Monkey Mash
are the good guys,

02:42.245 --> 02:44.372
and wouldn't hurt a fly,

02:44.455 --> 02:47.000
unless provoked.

02:52.964 --> 02:55.466
Yo! Weird guy and monkey thing,

02:55.550 --> 02:59.554
I'm off to give my future girlfriend
a gift.

02:59.637 --> 03:02.015
So… out of my way!

03:04.767 --> 03:06.019
Captain…

03:06.102 --> 03:08.479
-Punch!

03:09.939 --> 03:10.857
Yes!

03:10.940 --> 03:14.944
Today is the day that I, Zizrar,
King of the Mole People,

03:15.028 --> 03:18.072
finally launch my attack
on the surface!

03:20.617 --> 03:22.702
Well, good morning, freaks.

03:22.785 --> 03:23.828
I suggest you run,

03:23.912 --> 03:25.788
before…

03:26.998 --> 03:27.957
Whoa!

03:32.253 --> 03:35.924
Whoa, you guys look just like
Captain Punch and Monkey Mash!

03:37.175 --> 03:39.844
Should I get ready for battle?

03:44.432 --> 03:45.934
I want to assure everyone

03:46.017 --> 03:49.479
that together
with these fine special agents,

03:49.562 --> 03:53.274
we will stop the punching guy
and ape thing

03:53.358 --> 03:56.194
that are terrorizing our town.

03:56.277 --> 03:59.364
Wherever they are,
we will bring them to justice.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.866
And take them down!

04:03.243 --> 04:05.078
Oh, there they are.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.580
Captain… Punch!

04:10.208 --> 04:11.376
Let me guess.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.753
Johnny had something to do with this.

04:13.836 --> 04:14.879
Hey!

04:14.963 --> 04:19.175
Are we in that VR Melee game again
where Dukey talks, and…

04:20.468 --> 04:23.513
the cute Mole King plays too?

04:23.596 --> 04:25.181
Please stop that.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.017
Yes! We are in the VR game,

04:28.101 --> 04:30.645
and whoever knocks out
Captain Punch and Monkey Mash…

04:30.728 --> 04:33.439
And gets them back to our house, wins.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.858
Right! And if I win,

04:35.942 --> 04:39.153
Susan will wear this
victory-slash-love necklace

04:39.237 --> 04:40.530
I bought for her.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.240
Ew. No!

04:42.323 --> 04:47.537
Bling Bling, how fast can you get
our Melee Island suits here?

04:47.620 --> 04:49.998
Well, if I text my technicians,

04:50.081 --> 04:52.000
who can then summon my drones,

04:52.083 --> 04:54.544
-I'd say…

04:54.627 --> 04:55.712
Three minutes.

04:55.795 --> 04:59.716
-OK, to locate 'em faster, I say we all
-Team up!

04:59.799 --> 05:00.842
No, no, no, no!

05:00.925 --> 05:02.176
I don't want to go with--

05:03.386 --> 05:07.515
Alone again,
but I will be victorious,

05:07.598 --> 05:10.601
and Susan will wear my necklace!

05:10.685 --> 05:13.021
Ne…ver!

05:14.272 --> 05:19.777
Now, if I was Monkey Mash
and came to life, where would I be?

05:19.861 --> 05:22.196
Ooh, I know! In a tree!

05:30.747 --> 05:31.956
I'm stuck.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.458
Yeah, me too.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.461
Oh, man, I hope we can stop them first.

05:36.544 --> 05:39.547
Then we can finally beat Johnny
and those girls I've never seen before.

05:39.630 --> 05:42.133
OK, their names are Susan and Mary.

05:42.216 --> 05:44.343
You've lived next door to them
for 14 years.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.054
Now, say it with me.

05:46.137 --> 05:49.182
-Susan and Mary.
-But--

05:49.265 --> 05:53.227
No buts! In fact, I just got word

05:53.311 --> 05:56.814
the new game rules are to find them,
say their names,

05:56.898 --> 05:58.316
and walk them home.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.651
-But--
-But what?

06:00.735 --> 06:02.111
But what about that guy?

06:05.239 --> 06:07.867
-Oh…
-Punch!

06:12.997 --> 06:17.752
You're right. One monkey<i> is</i> no match
for two sisters in…

06:17.835 --> 06:20.713
power suits! Ha!

06:20.797 --> 06:23.257
Or… not.

06:26.677 --> 06:27.678
Gotcha!

06:27.762 --> 06:30.431
Eugene, you didn't catch Mary!

06:30.515 --> 06:32.517
But I'm not in love with Mary.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.102
Get her now!

06:38.606 --> 06:39.857
Thanks, Eugene.

06:39.941 --> 06:43.861
And for saving your sister,
as you requested,

06:43.945 --> 06:47.573
you promise to wear
this shiny symbol of our--

06:47.657 --> 06:48.991
Never!

06:50.910 --> 06:53.412
Huh. I wonder how Johnny's doing.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.582
You really think they'll be here?

06:56.666 --> 06:58.543
There's two things I'm good at, Dog.

06:58.626 --> 07:02.046
Book reports where I never
actually read the book, and video games.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.674
Trust me, they'll be here.

07:09.053 --> 07:11.514
Just so you know, we are huge fans.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.307
You're our favorites, in fact!

07:13.391 --> 07:15.893
Switch to max stun.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.314
But you were just supposed to be
small figurines on my shelf.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.400
-I feel real guilty.
-Don't.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.527
You blast the Captain,
I'll crush the monkey.

07:24.610 --> 07:25.528
Now!

07:32.785 --> 07:35.079
-Oh, we lost so bad.
-Johnny.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.999
How strong
are these video game characters?

07:38.082 --> 07:41.586
Their overall video game
power rating is 210,

07:41.669 --> 07:43.129
which is why we use them.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.133
'Cause they're so hard to beat!

07:47.675 --> 07:49.635
-Captain…

07:49.719 --> 07:50.928
I'll hold them off

07:51.012 --> 07:53.181
while you find a way to knock them out!

07:53.890 --> 07:56.142
-Hurry!

08:00.188 --> 08:02.815
Tag, you're it.

08:04.609 --> 08:08.112
That's twice Bling Bling
saved our butts today.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.448
But I'm still not wearing
that necklace.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.411
Johnny, we can't fight video game

08:15.495 --> 08:16.537
with video game…

08:16.621 --> 08:20.249
Because nothing in Melee Island
has a higher overall power rating

08:20.333 --> 08:22.585
than Captain Punch and Monkey Mash.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.671
Try Tiny'Mon Crash and Bash.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.177
Oh, this is not gonna be fun.

08:32.136 --> 08:35.389
You think I am going to help you,
Flame-Headed Boy?

08:35.473 --> 08:37.475
Why would I do that? Why, I tell you?

08:37.558 --> 08:40.186
Because helping is nice.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.438
Do you think I need a friend?
Is that it?

08:42.522 --> 08:45.191
You think I am lonely here
surrounded by Tiny'mon

08:45.274 --> 08:47.193
and not talking people like yourself?

08:47.276 --> 08:48.319
Uh…

08:48.402 --> 08:50.571
So if I help, you will be nicer to me,

08:50.655 --> 08:53.199
and maybe come here,
so we can walk and talk,

08:53.282 --> 08:56.786
and use real words,
not words like Bon-Bon.

08:56.869 --> 08:57.995
Bon-Bon?

08:59.038 --> 09:02.625
I can actually do better than that.

09:05.294 --> 09:07.755
-Hello?

09:07.838 --> 09:11.008
<i>Eugene, try and lure Captain Punch</i>
<i>and Monkey Mash to the park.</i>

09:11.092 --> 09:13.844
And if I do, Susan will wear the necklace?

09:13.928 --> 09:16.013
<i>No, but we need your help.</i>

09:16.097 --> 09:18.391
OK.

09:19.684 --> 09:24.063
OK, the park is in that direction, so…

09:24.146 --> 09:26.399
Yo, idiots!

09:27.692 --> 09:30.027
Oh, this is gonna hurt.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.196
Captain… Punch!

09:33.531 --> 09:34.865
Oof!

09:34.949 --> 09:36.325
Ha ha!

09:36.409 --> 09:39.370
You still haven't knocked me out.

09:39.453 --> 09:42.415
-Isn't that, like, your thing?

09:47.628 --> 09:49.213
Heh! Punch.

09:54.010 --> 09:54.969
Now!

10:02.310 --> 10:04.604
Oh, no, it didn't work!

10:04.687 --> 10:06.314
Wait for it.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.735
Hey, I think they stopped them.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.445
Yes!

10:19.577 --> 10:22.330
Um, are you OK?

10:22.413 --> 10:24.915
Well, my body is still intact,

10:24.999 --> 10:28.419
but my heart is… broken.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.921
I'll wear it for one hour!

10:32.590 --> 10:34.634
Susan and Mary?

10:34.717 --> 10:37.386
I know your names now,
and I'd like to walk you home,

10:37.470 --> 10:39.221
but I guess just Mary,

10:39.305 --> 10:42.683
'cause Susan's holding
someone's love necklace.

10:45.269 --> 10:48.856
-We totally win again.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.861
Well, this story is
wrapping up quite nicely.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.363
Even my arch nemesis

10:55.446 --> 10:58.074
and Captain Punch and Monkey Mash
had happy endings.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.371
I have to say,

11:03.454 --> 11:06.332
it will be fun having a friend
to talk to in Tiny'mon Land

11:06.415 --> 11:08.209
that uses real words.

11:08.292 --> 11:09.919
Captain… Punch!

11:10.002 --> 11:11.337
And we can take walks,

11:11.420 --> 11:13.714
and maybe even have deep conversations.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.841
Captain… Punch?

11:16.884 --> 11:18.135
I know, right?

11:18.928 --> 11:20.096
Captain Punch.
