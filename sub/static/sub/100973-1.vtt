32:40.199 --> 32:41.649
- Better start running.

32:41.683 --> 32:42.961
That fat one.

32:42.995 --> 32:47.103
He's gonna like need a
head start or something.

32:47.137 --> 32:49.622
- You didn't call
anyone, sweetheart.

32:49.657 --> 32:51.521
I have your cell phone.

32:57.665 --> 32:58.666
- So?

32:58.700 --> 32:59.632
So I walked to our neighbors.

32:59.667 --> 33:00.461
The Griffins.

33:00.495 --> 33:02.463
I used their phone.

33:02.497 --> 33:04.223
They have a gun, too.

33:06.156 --> 33:07.847
So you better leave.

33:13.508 --> 33:16.856
- Closest neighbor
is a mile and a half.

33:18.065 --> 33:18.997
- This is a child's toy.

33:19.031 --> 33:20.688
No way it reaches that far.

33:20.722 --> 33:23.863
Gentlemen, Becky is
on this property.

33:23.898 --> 33:25.141
And I don't think any of us

33:25.175 --> 33:26.349
feels like playing a
game of hide and seek,

33:26.383 --> 33:28.351
so why don't we make
it easy on ourselves

33:28.385 --> 33:30.698
and invite her to us, okay?

33:30.732 --> 33:32.010
Stop her bleeding.

33:32.044 --> 33:33.183
We might need her.

33:33.218 --> 33:35.151
Why don't you walk
Jeffery outside?

33:35.185 --> 33:36.152
- No, no, don't
take him, please.

33:36.186 --> 33:37.153
Please don't take him.

33:37.187 --> 33:39.155
Please don't do this to us.

33:39.189 --> 33:40.190
Please don't.

33:40.225 --> 33:43.504
[suspenseful music]

33:43.538 --> 33:45.506
- Prepare yourself, Becky.

33:45.540 --> 33:48.026
You're about to find out what
happens when you lie to me.

33:48.060 --> 33:51.029
[suspenseful music]

34:47.775 --> 34:48.603
You know.

34:50.329 --> 34:55.023
I wasn't blessed with children
in the traditional sense,

34:57.164 --> 35:00.650
but I collected some
strays along the way.

35:07.277 --> 35:08.106
My eldest.

35:10.315 --> 35:14.422
You know my most beautiful
memory of him was?

35:14.457 --> 35:17.115
Wasn't the day I found him.

35:17.149 --> 35:20.532
It was the day he
proved his love for me.

35:23.293 --> 35:26.607
And tonight, right now actually,

35:26.641 --> 35:30.542
will become your most
beautiful memory of Becky

35:32.509 --> 35:36.306
'cause this is the moment
she proves her love for you.

35:36.341 --> 35:38.826
[soft music]

35:51.321 --> 35:53.496
Becky, I'm gonna speak
to you like an adult,

35:53.530 --> 35:55.808
because I expect
you to act like one.

35:55.843 --> 35:57.810
You're not at the neighbors.

35:57.845 --> 36:00.468
I know you're in the
woods behind the house.

36:00.503 --> 36:03.678
So do me a favor and direct
your gaze to the fire pit.

36:03.713 --> 36:06.509
[dramatic music]

36:10.340 --> 36:15.034
My companion here, the
unreasonably large, scary one.

36:15.069 --> 36:18.176
He's gonna hold your dad
still while I hurt him.

36:18.210 --> 36:21.006
I can promise you it
will not be pleasant.

36:21.040 --> 36:23.698
[dramatic music]

36:27.875 --> 36:32.086
Now we can avoid that
unpleasantness if you cooperate.

36:32.120 --> 36:33.363
Listen closely.

36:35.054 --> 36:39.197
In the basement, in the
wall, was a small tin.

36:39.231 --> 36:40.750
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

36:40.784 --> 36:44.340
[dramatic music]

36:44.374 --> 36:45.203
- No.

36:45.237 --> 36:47.895
[dramatic music]

36:47.929 --> 36:49.690
- [Dominick] See, I
don't believe you.

36:49.724 --> 36:51.899
You already lied to me once.

36:51.933 --> 36:53.694
Now I think you found that tin

36:53.728 --> 36:56.869
and you took what was inside it.

36:56.904 --> 36:59.251
- [Becky] I don't
have your stupid key.

36:59.286 --> 37:01.219
- [Dominick] I never
said it was a key, Becky.

37:01.253 --> 37:03.221
[dramatic music]

37:03.255 --> 37:07.052
Now that I know you have it,
I hope you enjoy the show.

37:07.086 --> 37:09.779
[dramatic music]

37:13.127 --> 37:13.955
- Ah.

37:15.578 --> 37:16.406
Ah, ah.

37:18.581 --> 37:19.409
Ah.

37:22.101 --> 37:23.102
- It's okay.

37:23.965 --> 37:24.966
It's okay, baby.

37:25.001 --> 37:27.383
[dramatic music]

37:27.417 --> 37:29.937
[man groaning]

37:31.421 --> 37:32.629
- [Dominick] You get one shot.

37:32.664 --> 37:33.975
Make it count.

37:34.010 --> 37:36.426
[soft music]

37:40.430 --> 37:41.259
- Becky.

37:42.950 --> 37:45.470
Listen to me, Chipmunk.

37:45.504 --> 37:46.333
Sorry.

37:47.989 --> 37:49.439
I made a mistake.

37:50.337 --> 37:51.786
So many mistakes.

37:53.857 --> 37:54.686
Look.

37:55.790 --> 37:58.137
I know that you're mad at me

37:59.967 --> 38:01.796
and you have every right to be.

38:01.831 --> 38:04.282
[soft music]

38:06.870 --> 38:10.046
I need you to put
those feelings aside

38:11.634 --> 38:13.325
and do something for me.

38:13.360 --> 38:16.155
[dramatic music]

38:19.193 --> 38:23.439
I need you to run away
as fast as you can.

38:23.473 --> 38:24.612
Run, Becky.

38:24.647 --> 38:26.442
- Before you run,
Becky, listen up

38:26.476 --> 38:28.823
and know that you can
stop this if you want.

38:28.858 --> 38:31.792
[suspenseful music]

38:31.826 --> 38:32.655
- Ah.

38:34.829 --> 38:35.658
Ah.

38:38.177 --> 38:38.971
- No, stop.

38:39.006 --> 38:39.800
Stop.

38:39.834 --> 38:40.628
I'll get your key.

38:40.663 --> 38:42.147
I'll get your key.

38:42.181 --> 38:43.010
- Ah.

38:44.667 --> 38:45.461
- Stop.

38:45.495 --> 38:46.358
Stop.

38:46.393 --> 38:49.188
[dramatic music]

38:51.915 --> 38:53.641
- [Jeff] Ah.

38:53.676 --> 38:56.334
[dramatic music]

39:00.199 --> 39:05.101
[dog barking]
[dramatic music]

39:09.933 --> 39:13.178
[dramatic music]

39:13.212 --> 39:14.006
- I've got your key.

39:14.041 --> 39:15.353
I'm coming.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.078
[dramatic music]

39:17.113 --> 39:17.872
I'm coming, please.

39:17.907 --> 39:18.701
I'm almost there.

39:18.735 --> 39:20.841
[dramatic music]

39:20.875 --> 39:21.738
- [Dominick] Hold him.

39:21.773 --> 39:24.707
[dramatic music]

39:24.741 --> 39:26.191
- [Becky] Stop.

39:26.225 --> 39:28.711
- [Dominick] Oh, there she is.

39:30.126 --> 39:33.129
[suspenseful music]

39:47.419 --> 39:48.247
Let's go get her.

39:48.282 --> 39:49.145
- No.

39:50.422 --> 39:51.527
- [Dominick] We don't
have time for this.

39:51.561 --> 39:52.873
- No more kids.

39:52.907 --> 39:55.910
[suspenseful music]

40:02.641 --> 40:03.435
- Go to the neighbors.

40:03.470 --> 40:04.574
Call the police.

40:04.609 --> 40:07.543
[suspenseful music]

40:07.577 --> 40:08.406
- But Dad.

40:08.440 --> 40:09.545
Right behind you.

40:09.579 --> 40:10.408
- I love you, Becky.

40:10.442 --> 40:11.547
Go now.

40:11.581 --> 40:13.411
[gun firing]
[suspenseful music]

40:13.445 --> 40:16.172
[dramatic music]

40:25.595 --> 40:26.803
- Where's the key, Becky?

40:26.838 --> 40:27.632
Where is it?

40:27.666 --> 40:28.909
- Right here.

40:28.943 --> 40:30.566
- [Dominick] Ah.

40:30.600 --> 40:31.429
[soft music]

40:31.463 --> 40:32.291
Fuck.

40:33.154 --> 40:34.155
Fuck.

40:34.190 --> 40:35.294
Ugh.

40:35.329 --> 40:36.157
Ah.

40:36.192 --> 40:38.608
[soft music]

41:09.328 --> 41:11.814
[gentle music]

41:30.349 --> 41:31.523
Fuck.

41:31.558 --> 41:32.490
- Holy shit.

41:32.524 --> 41:33.698
What happened to you?

41:33.732 --> 41:34.630
- [Dominick] Oh,
that little bitch

41:34.664 --> 41:36.355
is in the woods out there.

41:37.425 --> 41:38.703
I can't see out of it.

41:38.737 --> 41:39.531
Ugh.

41:39.566 --> 41:40.498
- It's gone.

41:40.532 --> 41:41.326
It's shredded.

41:41.360 --> 41:42.154
- Fuck.

41:42.189 --> 41:42.983
Where's Hammond?

41:43.017 --> 41:44.156
- [Apex] The kitchen.

41:44.191 --> 41:46.055
- They go nowhere.

41:46.089 --> 41:46.883
- Yeah.

41:50.438 --> 41:52.164
- [Dominick] You
enjoying your snack?

41:52.199 --> 41:53.027
- Oh shit.

41:54.201 --> 41:54.995
- Cut it off, man.

41:55.029 --> 41:55.927
Cut it off.

42:00.207 --> 42:01.553
Come on.

42:01.588 --> 42:02.381
Easy.

42:02.416 --> 42:03.521
- Okay, here we go.

42:03.555 --> 42:04.522
You ready?
- Yeah, just do it.

42:04.556 --> 42:05.384
Ah.

42:06.696 --> 42:07.525
Ah.

42:08.871 --> 42:09.699
Ah.

42:10.873 --> 42:11.736
Ah.

42:11.770 --> 42:14.186
What the fuck is the problem?

42:14.221 --> 42:16.119
You fucking kidding me.

42:17.224 --> 42:18.363
- Sorry.

42:18.397 --> 42:20.848
[soft music]

42:20.883 --> 42:21.711
- Ah.

42:24.058 --> 42:26.026
Now get the fuck
outside and grab her

42:26.060 --> 42:30.237
before I decide you're too
useless to keep around.

42:32.619 --> 42:35.622
[suspenseful music]

43:10.139 --> 43:11.312
- Becky, where are you at?

43:11.347 --> 43:14.350
[suspenseful music]

43:15.765 --> 43:18.112
Let's just make this
easy on both of us, okay?

43:18.147 --> 43:20.943
[dramatic music]

43:23.842 --> 43:24.636
Hey.

43:24.671 --> 43:27.915
[dramatic music]

43:27.950 --> 43:28.778
Hey Becky.

43:28.813 --> 43:31.609
[dramatic music]

43:31.643 --> 43:32.610
Stop running.

43:32.644 --> 43:35.474
[dramatic music]

43:58.670 --> 44:01.466
Oh, man, you're in a fort now.

44:01.500 --> 44:03.123
What am I gonna do?

44:03.157 --> 44:05.988
[dramatic music]

44:07.990 --> 44:08.991
I guess you should've
locked the door.

44:09.025 --> 44:10.509
[dog barking]

44:10.544 --> 44:11.510
Fuck, fuck.

44:11.545 --> 44:12.477
Shit.

44:12.511 --> 44:13.685
Ugly son of a bitch.

44:13.720 --> 44:15.376
[dog barking]

44:15.411 --> 44:16.205
Fuck me.

44:16.239 --> 44:17.482
Two fucking dogs.

44:17.516 --> 44:18.483
How many fucking
dogs you gotta have?

44:18.517 --> 44:19.311
- Diego, quiet.

44:19.346 --> 44:20.140
- [Cole] Motherfucker.

44:20.174 --> 44:20.968
- Sit.

44:21.003 --> 44:21.831
- Fuck.

44:25.835 --> 44:26.664
Hey.

44:28.562 --> 44:29.390
Cool fort.

44:33.049 --> 44:33.878
Hi.

44:35.534 --> 44:36.812
I just wanna talk.

44:36.846 --> 44:37.675
No, hey.

44:37.709 --> 44:38.710
We're just talking.

44:38.745 --> 44:40.367
We're just talking.

44:43.750 --> 44:44.578
I don't have a weapon.

44:44.612 --> 44:46.545
I'm not gonna hurt you.

44:48.927 --> 44:50.170
Hello?

44:50.204 --> 44:51.033
- Go away.

44:54.415 --> 44:55.416
- Look, kid.

44:57.246 --> 44:58.557
You really think I
wanna be out here,

44:58.592 --> 45:01.215
tripping over shit in the woods?

45:04.046 --> 45:05.703
You want me to go.

45:05.737 --> 45:06.773
I want to go.

45:07.774 --> 45:09.223
But neither of us is gonna get

45:09.258 --> 45:12.088
what we want until
I get that key.

45:15.229 --> 45:18.405
So let's you and I
make a little deal.

45:19.751 --> 45:22.064
Just throw the key out here.

45:23.755 --> 45:26.378
I'll tell 'em that I picked
it up off the ground.

45:26.413 --> 45:27.586
I'll say you got away.

45:27.621 --> 45:29.554
They're not gonna ask
too many questions

45:29.588 --> 45:31.729
so long as I have the key.

45:37.769 --> 45:38.597
Okay?

45:39.771 --> 45:42.118
[soft music]

45:50.092 --> 45:50.920
- Okay.

45:52.266 --> 45:53.095
- Okay.

45:54.682 --> 45:59.273
You can just toss it on out
here and I'll be on my way.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.935
You, your little bro and
your mom will be safe.

46:10.284 --> 46:11.113
- What?

46:12.528 --> 46:13.909
- [Cole] I said you and your
mom and your little brother.

46:13.943 --> 46:15.773
You'll all be safe.

46:15.807 --> 46:17.775
- [Becky] My mom's dead.

46:23.953 --> 46:25.610
- Okay well, your stepmom then.

46:25.644 --> 46:26.473
Whatever.

46:29.994 --> 46:32.790
The point is, she's still alive

46:32.824 --> 46:35.447
and the little boy
is still alive.

46:35.482 --> 46:37.449
[soft music]

46:37.484 --> 46:40.798
And you can go off and
have a nice life together.

46:40.832 --> 46:41.799
Right?

46:41.833 --> 46:44.353
[gentle music]

47:08.722 --> 47:11.725
[suspenseful music]

47:24.531 --> 47:25.877
Becky?

47:25.912 --> 47:27.568
We still got a deal or what?

47:27.603 --> 47:30.364
[dramatic music]

47:35.714 --> 47:36.715
Hello?

47:36.750 --> 47:37.993
- I'm getting your stupid key.

47:38.027 --> 47:39.580
Give me a second.

47:39.615 --> 47:42.376
[dramatic music]

47:56.390 --> 48:01.395
[dog barking]
[dramatic music]

48:02.396 --> 48:05.123
[dramatic music]

48:14.063 --> 48:15.375
Here it comes.

48:15.409 --> 48:17.895
[soft music]

48:20.242 --> 48:22.037
- Good throw.

48:22.071 --> 48:24.763
[dramatic music]

48:27.594 --> 48:28.733
Fucking kids.

48:28.767 --> 48:31.494
[dramatic music]

48:35.774 --> 48:37.086
- Ah.

48:37.121 --> 48:37.949
[gun firing]

48:37.984 --> 48:38.916
[dramatic music]

48:38.950 --> 48:40.089
- Ah.

48:40.124 --> 48:41.056
Ah.

48:41.090 --> 48:42.126
Fuck.

48:42.160 --> 48:43.058
Ah.

48:43.092 --> 48:46.061
[dramatic music]

48:46.095 --> 48:47.407
What the fuck?

48:47.441 --> 48:52.446
[dramatic music]
[man groaning]

49:17.368 --> 49:18.265
- Fuck.

49:18.300 --> 49:20.888
[gentle music]

49:51.160 --> 49:54.992
- I think my leg is still
bleeding pretty bad.

50:09.523 --> 50:10.352
It's okay.

50:25.194 --> 50:26.747
- It's fine.

50:26.782 --> 50:28.542
I'll wrap it tighter.

50:33.409 --> 50:35.549
- I heard Jeff screaming.

50:36.550 --> 50:37.379
Is he?

50:50.461 --> 50:52.773
You tried to help us before.

50:55.431 --> 50:58.538
You and I both know how
this is gonna end for me.

50:58.572 --> 50:59.470
For my son.

51:00.747 --> 51:02.266
You don't want that.

51:04.095 --> 51:06.442
You don't want this.

51:06.477 --> 51:07.305
You don't.

51:09.963 --> 51:10.791
Please.

51:13.760 --> 51:16.556
[footsteps approaching]

51:16.590 --> 51:18.075
- [Dominick] Apex.

51:22.320 --> 51:23.149
- Please.

51:27.601 --> 51:30.017
[soft music]

51:47.311 --> 51:50.245
- [Becky] I'm not gonna let
them get away with this.

51:50.279 --> 51:52.695
[soft music]

51:57.873 --> 52:00.841
[suspenseful music]

52:35.876 --> 52:36.705
- Take it.

52:39.915 --> 52:41.503
Take the gun, Apex.

52:46.370 --> 52:48.165
Here you go.

52:48.199 --> 52:50.339
Now, point it at my heart.

52:54.205 --> 52:55.689
Nine years, four
months, and two days.

52:55.724 --> 52:57.519
You know what that is?

52:59.383 --> 53:00.660
- How long we were in.

53:00.694 --> 53:02.317
- That's right.

53:02.351 --> 53:07.356
That's 54,538 waking hours.

53:09.772 --> 53:11.533
Do you know how many of those

53:11.567 --> 53:14.915
I spent planning,
calculating, this day?

53:16.054 --> 53:16.917
Hm?

53:16.952 --> 53:19.057
Do you have any idea how many?

53:19.092 --> 53:20.335
Every.

53:20.369 --> 53:21.508
Single.

53:21.543 --> 53:22.371
One.

53:23.890 --> 53:27.514
Not a moment went
by that this plan,

53:27.549 --> 53:29.033
and our glorious
execution of it,

53:29.067 --> 53:32.519
wasn't at the
forefront of my mind.

53:32.554 --> 53:35.557
Now, when you plan
something, anything,

53:35.591 --> 53:38.905
you run all the
scenarios in your head.

53:40.907 --> 53:44.876
You identify
vulnerabilities, weak points.

53:44.911 --> 53:47.914
You try to find out what
that thing is going to be.

53:47.948 --> 53:51.607
The one thing that's
gonna be your downfall.

53:54.300 --> 53:55.439
All the times I ran it,

53:55.473 --> 53:58.580
never once did I
think it would be you.

54:05.656 --> 54:06.760
- Those kids.

54:07.796 --> 54:09.936
I can't get them out of my mind.

54:09.970 --> 54:12.559
- Put your finger
on the trigger.

54:12.594 --> 54:13.388
- [Apex] I don't understand.

54:13.422 --> 54:14.251
- Put.

54:15.286 --> 54:16.908
Your finger.

54:16.943 --> 54:18.082
On the trigger.

54:18.116 --> 54:20.740
[suspenseful music]

54:20.774 --> 54:23.294
I can't do this
without you, son.

54:23.329 --> 54:25.641
I need you on this.

54:25.676 --> 54:30.301
54,538 hours planning.

54:30.336 --> 54:32.752
I don't wanna be
alive for one more

54:32.786 --> 54:36.445
knowing that we came
this far and we failed.

54:38.861 --> 54:40.829
So, if you're not gonna help me,

54:40.863 --> 54:43.003
[suspenseful music]

54:43.038 --> 54:45.627
you go ahead and kill me.

54:45.661 --> 54:48.664
[suspenseful music]

55:02.989 --> 55:05.129
I knew I could
count on you, son.

55:05.163 --> 55:08.166
[suspenseful music]

55:12.343 --> 55:13.689
For the Brotherhood.

55:13.724 --> 55:16.485
[dramatic music]

55:17.555 --> 55:19.005
- For the Brotherhood.

55:19.039 --> 55:21.835
[dramatic music]

55:47.861 --> 55:49.173
[wall thudding]

55:49.207 --> 55:51.934
[dramatic music]

56:04.878 --> 56:05.707
- Cole.

56:05.741 --> 56:08.537
[dramatic music]

56:11.540 --> 56:16.511
- There once was a little
girl who had a little curl

56:16.545 --> 56:19.548
right in the middle
of her forehead.

56:21.412 --> 56:25.554
When she was good, she
was very, very good,

56:25.589 --> 56:29.040
but when she was
bad, she was horrid.

56:29.075 --> 56:31.802
[dramatic music]

57:04.766 --> 57:08.114
- I need you to tell
Becky to come back.

57:22.300 --> 57:23.819
You feel better now?

57:23.854 --> 57:26.477
I'm not gonna ask again.

57:26.512 --> 57:28.306
Speak slow and clear.

57:30.170 --> 57:32.103
- She won't listen to me.

57:32.138 --> 57:33.450
- You're her guardian.

57:33.484 --> 57:34.623
- No, I'm not.

57:35.969 --> 57:38.489
And it wouldn't
matter even if I was.

57:38.524 --> 57:42.769
Becky is as strong-willed
and vindictive as they come

57:42.804 --> 57:47.464
and you just tortured and
killed her only living parent.

57:49.811 --> 57:51.191
[gentle music]

57:51.226 --> 57:52.296
So good luck.

57:52.330 --> 57:54.885
[gentle music]

57:59.234 --> 58:00.028
- [Dominick] Go get her.

58:00.062 --> 58:01.788
[gentle music]

58:01.823 --> 58:03.307
- Hammond's still out there.

58:03.341 --> 58:05.482
- [Dominick] Yes, but
apparently Becky's a little more

58:05.516 --> 58:07.138
than we bargained for.

58:07.173 --> 58:09.831
[gentle music]

59:05.403 --> 59:10.408
[suspenseful music]
[dog barking]

59:14.758 --> 59:15.586
- Cole.

59:15.621 --> 59:17.208
Cole.

59:17.243 --> 59:18.071
You okay?

59:19.728 --> 59:20.557
Fuck.

59:21.592 --> 59:22.420
Shit.

59:23.905 --> 59:25.700
- Hey, shit stain.

59:25.734 --> 59:26.735
You want the key?

59:26.770 --> 59:28.392
You gotta catch me first.

59:28.426 --> 59:31.153
[dramatic music]

59:32.638 --> 59:33.431
- [Hammond] Come back here.

59:33.466 --> 59:36.262
[dramatic music]

59:38.782 --> 59:40.128
Right over here.

59:41.129 --> 59:41.923
Not gonna hurt ya.

59:41.957 --> 59:43.407

59:43.441 --> 59:44.753
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:00:08.466 --> 01:00:10.261

01:00:19.201 --> 01:00:20.099

01:00:48.161 --> 01:00:48.990
Fuck.

01:00:52.821 --> 01:00:54.340
Ah.

I can't swim.

01:01:25.543 --> 01:01:26.372
Help please.

Help me.

Help.

01:02:24.982 --> 01:02:26.743
Stop, stop, stop.

01:03:58.558 --> 01:03:59.352
- No.

01:03:59.387 --> 01:04:00.837
Diego, no.

01:04:00.871 --> 01:04:01.596
No.

01:04:05.531 --> 01:04:06.359
Diego.

01:04:07.188 --> 01:04:09.017
Please, Diego, Diego.

01:04:11.261 --> 01:04:12.331
Please.

01:04:12.365 --> 01:04:13.194
Please.

01:04:16.783 --> 01:04:18.164
- You should have left
when you had the chance.

01:04:18.199 --> 01:04:18.993
- No.

01:04:19.027 --> 01:04:19.856
Let me go.

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:21.616
Let me go, let me go.

01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:23.687
Stop.

[suspenseful music]

01:04:25.378 --> 01:04:26.517

01:05:11.252 --> 01:05:13.495
I saw what you did to Cole.

01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:16.671
Those kind of things,

01:05:18.155 --> 01:05:20.571
they leave a stain.

01:05:20.606 --> 01:05:22.746
I got too many stains of my own.

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.266
[gentle music]

01:05:26.784 --> 01:05:29.132
It's not too late for you.

01:05:29.166 --> 01:05:30.754
You're just a kid.

01:05:30.788 --> 01:05:33.274
[gentle music]

01:05:46.839 --> 01:05:47.667
I'm done.

01:05:50.808 --> 01:05:53.156
I don't care what
Dominick wants anymore.

01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:55.952
[gentle music]

01:05:55.986 --> 01:05:57.332
I am walking away

01:05:58.471 --> 01:06:00.542
and I hope you will, too.

[suspenseful music]
[dog whining]

01:06:12.865 --> 01:06:13.693
- Diego.

01:06:15.005 --> 01:06:15.833
Diego.

01:06:18.871 --> 01:06:20.321
Diego, Diego.

01:06:20.355 --> 01:06:22.875
[dog panting]

01:06:26.706 --> 01:06:27.500
It's okay.

01:06:27.535 --> 01:06:28.329
You're okay.

01:06:28.363 --> 01:06:30.469
You're okay, boy.

01:06:30.503 --> 01:06:32.989
[eerie music]

01:07:10.888 --> 01:07:11.855
- It's okay.

01:07:19.207 --> 01:07:21.623
[soft music]

01:07:38.226 --> 01:07:39.365
- Hold.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.194
Hold.

01:07:40.228 --> 01:07:42.644
[soft music]

01:07:54.622 --> 01:07:55.450
Hey, dad.

01:07:57.452 --> 01:07:58.936
It's me, Chipmunk.

01:07:58.971 --> 01:08:01.422
[soft music]

01:08:02.664 --> 01:08:04.390
Tell mom hi for me.

01:08:04.425 --> 01:08:06.944
[soft music]

01:08:16.506 --> 01:08:21.511
[keys jingling]
[soft music]

01:08:29.622 --> 01:08:31.002
Diego, come.

01:08:31.037 --> 01:08:33.799
[dramatic music]

01:09:08.488 --> 01:09:09.317
- Hey.

01:09:10.836 --> 01:09:13.149
What the fuck was the
point of all of this?

01:09:13.183 --> 01:09:14.322
- What's that?

01:09:16.013 --> 01:09:17.981
- [Kayla] I said, what
the fuck was the point?

01:09:18.015 --> 01:09:18.877
- You cursed.

01:09:18.912 --> 01:09:20.156
- I know, baby.

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:21.640
Sometimes someone does
something so stupid,

01:09:21.674 --> 01:09:26.300
you have to stop them and ask,
what the fuck was the point?

01:09:26.334 --> 01:09:28.474
You murdered my fiance.

01:09:28.509 --> 01:09:29.819
Your men are gone.

01:09:29.854 --> 01:09:31.649
You lost your fucking eye.

01:09:31.684 --> 01:09:33.029
For what?

01:09:33.064 --> 01:09:33.893
For a key?

01:09:34.929 --> 01:09:36.171
What the fuck could it open

01:09:36.206 --> 01:09:37.656
that would make it
worth all of this?

01:09:37.689 --> 01:09:40.520
[soft music]

01:09:40.555 --> 01:09:41.832
- Oh.

01:09:41.867 --> 01:09:44.006
It's worth much more than that.

01:09:44.041 --> 01:09:46.872
See I don't expect you
to understand this,

01:09:46.906 --> 01:09:48.908
but I'm doing it for your
kind as much as mine.

01:09:48.943 --> 01:09:50.496
- Oh, is that right?

01:09:50.531 --> 01:09:51.911
- Yeah, it is right.

01:09:51.946 --> 01:09:55.329
You see the races all were
created with a divine purpose,

01:09:55.363 --> 01:09:59.678
but our modern world has blurred
and distorted that purpose.
