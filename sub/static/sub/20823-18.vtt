WEBVTT

00:05.700 --> 00:07.827
- Look at that one.
Look at his face.

00:07.870 --> 00:11.476
- It's hilarious. Can you just
send it to the client already?

00:11.530 --> 00:14.658
- Yeah. I can't believe
you got that guy

00:14.710 --> 00:16.837
to lift a 60-pound box
over his head

00:16.880 --> 00:19.189
while wearing a neck brace
in broad daylight.

00:19.230 --> 00:21.482
- All in a day's work.
- Right.

00:21.540 --> 00:25.055
Photos are on their way.
- Great.

00:25.110 --> 00:28.841
- So, is it a present
or just news?

00:28.890 --> 00:31.450
- My surprise.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.809
- That call yesterday.

00:33.850 --> 00:36.501
You were on the phone
for, like, ten minutes,
all cloak and dagger.

00:36.550 --> 00:39.462
- If I wanted you to know,
I would've told you.

00:39.510 --> 00:41.466
- Well, if you didn't
want me to know,

00:41.510 --> 00:43.466
you would've waited
until I was gone.

00:43.520 --> 00:46.250
It's a surprise, right
- For God's sake,

00:46.300 --> 00:48.473
you're worse than a kid at
Christmas shaking his gifts.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.512
Open the glove box.

00:55.010 --> 00:58.309
Look inside.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.396
It's the one-year anniversary
of our very first case,

01:00.450 --> 01:02.441
and I figured

01:02.490 --> 01:05.835
you're part of this firm,
you might as well have
your name on it.

01:07.630 --> 01:10.019
- I've never had my name
on anything before.

01:12.150 --> 01:15.324
So I guess Shade and Everett
was already taken?
- Oh, shut up.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.982
- No idea.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.971
- I see you and you see me

01:56.020 --> 01:59.410
Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're making a scene

01:59.460 --> 02:03.021
Oh boy, you've got to know

02:03.070 --> 02:05.243
What my head overlooks

02:05.290 --> 02:08.168
The senses will show
to my heart

02:08.210 --> 02:10.462
When it's watching for lies

02:10.520 --> 02:13.774
'Cause you can't escape my

02:13.820 --> 02:15.697
Private Eyes

02:15.740 --> 02:17.958
They're watching you

02:18.000 --> 02:20.139
Private Eyes

02:20.180 --> 02:22.398
They're watching you,
watching you, watching you

02:22.440 --> 02:26.444
Watching you

02:26.490 --> 02:29.448
- So, you think someone
bugged our office.

02:29.490 --> 02:33.233
- I'm so sorry about all of
that. I just... I need
to be extra careful.

02:33.280 --> 02:36.454
Is someone
after you?

02:36.500 --> 02:38.627
- I don't know. Maybe.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.716
I'm not really sure
of anything anymore.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.320
- Why don't you just tell us
what happened?
- OK, um...

02:45.290 --> 02:47.986
My name is Dana Edson.
I'm a software engineer.

02:51.510 --> 02:53.728
- Sorry to hear that.
What company?

02:53.780 --> 02:56.908
- Summit Path Technologies.
They're IT consultants.

02:56.950 --> 02:59.032
They build customised

03:01.220 --> 03:04.132
Tech architecture,
UX design, stuff like that.

03:04.180 --> 03:06.000
- Yeah, sure. Oh yeah.

03:09.970 --> 03:12.484
- I'm sorry,
just one second.

03:14.970 --> 03:18.497
- It's OK, just...
take your time.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.456
- You need to understand

03:22.500 --> 03:25.230
that there aren't a lot of
female coders out there, so...

03:25.290 --> 03:27.246
I got a lot of attention.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.929
- Unwanted attention.

03:29.990 --> 03:33.153
- My first week there,
the founder of the company,

03:33.210 --> 03:35.940
Ray West, started
hanging around my desk,

03:35.990 --> 03:38.129
telling me how good I looked,

03:38.170 --> 03:41.424
that I must work out.
It made me uncomfortable.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.732
- Of course,

03:43.780 --> 03:47.261
but nothing changed.
In fact, things got weirder.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.437
West started asking me

03:49.490 --> 03:51.788
personal questions

03:51.840 --> 03:53.614
about my tattoo,
my brother's divorce--

03:53.660 --> 03:55.525
things he couldn't
possibly know about.

03:55.580 --> 03:58.879
And then one day he asked
all the male employees

03:58.930 --> 04:01.057
into his office to discuss...

04:01.110 --> 04:03.010
Project Marigold.

04:03.060 --> 04:06.939
- As it turns out,

04:06.980 --> 04:08.936
it was me.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.720
That's my bedroom.

04:19.780 --> 04:22.419
West used a remote hack
to activate

04:22.470 --> 04:25.121
the webcam on my smart TV.

04:25.170 --> 04:27.126
- He can do
whatever he wants.

04:27.170 --> 04:29.309
You know that privacy
is meaningless

04:29.350 --> 04:31.432
in this day
and age, right?

04:31.480 --> 04:34.438
The next day, I told West that
if he didn't stop harassing me,

04:34.490 --> 04:37.789
I'd go right to the police.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.094
I got a termination notice
that afternoon.

04:41.150 --> 04:44.404
- Well, this is
all kinds of wrong,

04:44.450 --> 04:47.624
but you really need
to talk to a lavwer.

04:47.670 --> 04:51.231
- Shade's right. This
has wrongful dismissal
written all over it.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.804
- I wanna sue him, but...

04:53.850 --> 04:56.318
I'm afraid of what other photos
he might have of me,

04:56.380 --> 04:59.463
from my phone, from my laptop...
- You're afraid

04:59.510 --> 05:01.466
that he'll post
the other photos online.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.126
- I looked into you.

05:06.170 --> 05:09.298
You have a reputation
for helping people
with difficult problems

05:09.350 --> 05:13.081
and I just thought if...
look, if I could just
get those photos back--

05:13.130 --> 05:16.179
- Steal them back, you mean.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.923
- They're on a hard drive
in the main computer lab

05:21.970 --> 05:25.269
on the fifth floor.
- And are you sure
there's no duplicates?

05:25.320 --> 05:27.754
- West isn't dumb enough
to upload them to the cloud.

05:30.890 --> 05:33.495
- Yeah.

05:36.460 --> 05:39.805
- I think someone needs
to help this woman.

05:39.860 --> 05:43.284
- It's recovering.

05:43.340 --> 05:45.296
She never gave them permission
to take those photos
in the first place.

05:45.340 --> 05:48.298
It makes my skin crawl.
- You get no argument
from me there,

05:48.340 --> 05:50.513
but how are we
gonna do this?

05:52.430 --> 05:54.739
- With a really good plan.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.056
- Go for Red Eagle One.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.409
- For the last time,
we don't need code names.

06:10.450 --> 06:13.408
- You're just pissed
'cause I took the best one.
How's It looking on your end?

06:13.460 --> 06:16.406
- Well, there's a loading dock
back here and some service doors

06:16.460 --> 06:18.928
but no easy access. You?

06:18.980 --> 06:22.370
- Yeah, this place is locked up
tighter than Spanx on
a sumo wrestler.

06:22.420 --> 06:24.376
[As far as I can tell,
to get in]

06:24.420 --> 06:26.468
- Yeah, I can see that.

06:26.510 --> 06:29.206
At least that's something.
]

06:29.250 --> 06:31.718
- Well, for all their tech
5am, they're still using

06:31.780 --> 06:34.419
a standard security protocol.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.859
Hold on. Hey, Zoe.

06:37.910 --> 06:41.084
- Sweet. I can never figure out
how to do that.

06:41.130 --> 06:43.439
- [Well, the security guys
just finished.]

06:43.490 --> 06:46.266
The bug sweep came back clean.
- Well, that's one piece
of good news.

06:46.310 --> 06:49.097
- I also contacted my friend
at the employment office.

06:49.140 --> 06:52.439
He confirmed that a Dana Edson
was let go at Summit Path
three weeks ago.

06:52.490 --> 06:55.106
- What can you tell us
about the company?
- Not much.

06:55.150 --> 06:57.584
Their home page is basically
a glorified Twitter timeline.

06:57.630 --> 07:00.542
Sending you a pic of the chief
tweeter himself.

07:00.590 --> 07:03.457
- OK, Zoe, get a hold of Dana,
have her meet us back

07:03.510 --> 07:06.149
at the office. We're gonna need
some inside information.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.428
- They were a part

07:12.470 --> 07:14.688
of my orientation package
when I was first hired.

07:14.730 --> 07:17.426
- Poetic justice.
Now you get to use them
to take the company down.

07:19.300 --> 07:22.690
- So, I think the best way in
is through this door near
the loading docks.

07:22.740 --> 07:24.867
- I saw that
when I was there,

07:24.920 --> 07:26.911
but there's a security camera
pointed right at it.

07:26.960 --> 07:30.441
- Well, there are cameras
everywhere. You can't
avoid them.

07:30.490 --> 07:33.448
So, once you're inside,
it's a straight shot

07:33.490 --> 07:36.448
up this elevator to the fifth
floor lab, and...

07:36.490 --> 07:39.709
this is where the hard drives
are stored.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.534
- Alright. Anything else
we need to know about?

07:41.590 --> 07:45.492
Piranha tank? Giant
rolling boulder, maybe?

07:45.550 --> 07:47.632
- No, that's pretty much it.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.547
Oh, except for the, uh,
motion sensors.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.898
- In the lab.

07:52.950 --> 07:55.908
There aren't any cameras in
there because the information
IS proprietary,

07:55.950 --> 07:59.556
so the_motion sensors
kIck In after hours.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.865
- OK, well,
daytime it is, then.

08:02.910 --> 08:05.083
- We still have the same
problem. We need a key card.

08:05.130 --> 08:08.782
- And not just anyone's
key card. They have to have
access to the fifth floor.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.435
- How would you like
to put that athleticism

08:13.490 --> 08:15.572
you keep bragging about
to the test?

08:30.940 --> 08:33.727
- Hey! Hey!

08:34.470 --> 08:36.461
- I got it!

08:47.650 --> 08:50.084
Hurry up, he's right behind me!

08:50.130 --> 08:52.473
- No key card.
- It's gotta be there
somewhere. Check the pocket.

08:54.140 --> 08:57.223
- I'm telling you,
it's not here.
- OK, well, just take his phone.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.613
Meet me back at the agency. Go.

09:03.630 --> 09:06.884
Oh, hey!
- Oh my God, that's amazing!

09:06.930 --> 09:08.978
You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

09:09.020 --> 09:11.409
I stopped him, but I think
he got your cell phone.

09:11.460 --> 09:13.416
- Oh, don't worry about that.
I've got two backups.

09:13.460 --> 09:15.985
At least you got
my wallet, right?

09:16.030 --> 09:18.066
Hey, um...

09:18.120 --> 09:20.418
Can I repay you somehow?

09:20.470 --> 09:23.200
Let me take you out
to dinner.

09:23.250 --> 09:26.299
What's your Ameechee handle?
I'll, uh, I'll DM you.

09:26.340 --> 09:29.776
- You know what, I'm actually
on a social media cleanse.
Thanks aanays.

09:29.830 --> 09:33.175
- OK.

09:33.220 --> 09:35.825
- I mean,

09:35.870 --> 09:39.397
seriously, people, stop
using your birth year.
- Apparently, privacy

09:39.440 --> 09:42.443
isn't high on his list
of priorities. Can you
bring up his calendar?

09:42.490 --> 09:46.449
- I don't understand. I thought
all you needed was a key card.

09:46.490 --> 09:49.311
- We do.

09:49.370 --> 09:51.406
There. I just made
an appointment

09:51.460 --> 09:53.405
in Mr_. West's calendar _
for a meeting tomorrow morning.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.759
Who's that supposed to be?

09:59.940 --> 10:02.670
- Better brush up
on your German.

10:02.730 --> 10:05.244
_ 1--

10:21.620 --> 10:23.656
- Ha ha. Very funny.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.133
I just want to be well-versed
when I visit Jules in Italy.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.579
- Planning on ordering a lot
of vegetarian dishes, are ya?

10:28.620 --> 10:31.578
Speaking of Jules, where is she?
- Upstairs.

10:31.630 --> 10:35.623
Uh, I wouldn't.

10:35.670 --> 10:37.672
- She's with Liam.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.974
What's he doing here?
- She said he wanted to talk.

10:41.030 --> 10:43.157
- Yeah, I'm sure that's
what he wants to do.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.543
- Relax, Dad, we only
went to third base.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.329
- Hi, Mr. Shade.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.985
Uh, she's totally kidding
about third base.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.814
I don't even know
what that is.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.033
I mean, I know,

10:54.080 --> 10:56.685
but I--
- Stop talking, Liam.

10:56.740 --> 11:00.380
- Yes, sir. Well, I better
get going. See you around.

11:00.440 --> 11:04.479
- Yeah, sure.
- OK. Take care.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.520
- Dad, don't.

11:08.580 --> 11:11.879
- Why is he even still
hanging around? I thought
you two split up.

11:11.930 --> 11:14.888
Tomorrow, you're going
to Italy for 4 months!

11:14.930 --> 11:18.400
It's the first
I've heard about it.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.360
- Just promise me
you've got it handled.

11:20.410 --> 11:22.844
- I do. Thanks.

11:31.420 --> 11:34.639
- Matt Shade.

11:34.690 --> 11:37.204
[You probably don't remember me.
I'm Dan Chambers'
older brother.]

11:40.090 --> 11:44.049
- Yeah, but two years
before you and Dan.

11:44.090 --> 11:46.342
Long gone by the time
you guys came up.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.779
I got scouted by a team
in Scotland, of all places.
- Wow.

11:49.830 --> 11:51.570
- Yeah.

11:54.140 --> 11:56.404
I haven't seen
that guy in 25 years.

11:56.450 --> 11:59.146
- He's great.
He's living in Seattle.

11:59.190 --> 12:01.533
Made a killing off
real estate, unlike me,

12:01.590 --> 12:04.491
hanging in this crappy bar
reminiscing about Coach Bishop.

12:04.540 --> 12:08.897
- Coach Bishop, wow.
Didn't he always wear a--
- Yeah, the silver bowties.

12:08.940 --> 12:12.330
- Yeah.
- For 10 years, I thought
that was the epitome of cool.

12:12.380 --> 12:14.541
- Ouch.
- Dread.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.728
Look, Shadow, um,

12:17.780 --> 12:20.419
I didn't call you here
to reminisce about hockey.

12:20.470 --> 12:23.735
I called you here
because my brother said
that I could trust you.

12:23.780 --> 12:27.432
You are a PI, right?

12:30.920 --> 12:34.356
- That is the puck that won
the 1951 Stanley Cup finals.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.358
Game 5, Toronto over Montreal.
It belonged to my grandfather.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.790
- Wow.
- He was at the game that night,
proposed to my grandmother,

12:40.840 --> 12:42.796
and to commemorate
the occa5|on

12:42.840 --> 12:45.058
he ultimately bought the puck.

12:45.110 --> 12:48.978
- Someone took it.
- I think

12:49.020 --> 12:52.194
it was my ex's new boyfriend,
Randy, but I was hoping
you could help me out.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.858
- Sure.
- Oh, great!
- Can you give me

12:55.900 --> 12:59.597
a couple of days, though? I'm
just wrapping up another case.

12:59.640 --> 13:03.030
I mean, I'm pretty sure he's
gonna sell, and he's gonna
move as quick as he can.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.389
- Yeah, it's a kind of
a sensitive case.
Sexual harassment.

13:05.430 --> 13:07.819
It requires
my full attention.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.952
I'll tell you what: I'll call
you in a couple of days and
we'll figure it out, OK?

13:10.000 --> 13:14.391
- Oh, OK. Thanks, Shadow.
- You got it. I'll be in touch.

13:16.750 --> 13:19.651
- OK, that's West's building.

13:19.710 --> 13:22.315
Oh, and you'll need
one of these.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.669
- This is a really
bad idea, boss.

13:24.710 --> 13:26.792
- We have no choice.
I can't do it,

13:26.840 --> 13:29.582
West has already seen me.

13:31.890 --> 13:34.358
All set, Shade?
- Jawohl.

13:34.420 --> 13:36.843
- Remember, you have to hold
your phone up to his key card

13:36.900 --> 13:39.858
[for a full 3 seconds in order
for the cloning app to work.]

13:39.900 --> 13:43.028
- Yeah, no pressure.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.810
Guten Tag.

13:45.860 --> 13:48.328
- Uh, my nommen
is Fritz Rademacher

13:48.390 --> 13:51.996
undI have an appointment
mitMr. West.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.429
- OK. You can have a seat.
- Danke.

13:59.310 --> 14:02.040
- OK, seriously, I don't think
I can do this. I mean,
what if I freeze up?

14:02.100 --> 14:05.661
Or, you know, even worse, what
if I can't stop talking? That's
a thing with me, you know.

14:05.710 --> 14:08.019
- Yeah, I'm familiar.
Can you just calm down?

14:08.060 --> 14:10.369
I'm gonna be in your ear
the whole time guiding you.

14:10.410 --> 14:12.366
- I don't even know why
I agreed to do this.

14:12.410 --> 14:15.231
- Because I made it conditional
upon your continued employment?

14:27.120 --> 14:29.680
- Ah, mister, uh...
- Rademacher.
- Right.

14:29.730 --> 14:31.994
I'm sorry, it's just
I don't remember

14:32.040 --> 14:34.508
scheduling this interview.
- Yeah, it was some months ago

14:34.560 --> 14:37.518
_ at the coders conference
In Gdansk. I'm sure you remember

14:37.570 --> 14:41.210
the keynote speaker. She had the
hair the colour of hefeweizen.

14:41.270 --> 14:45.354
- Uh... it's just I'm not sure
if there's a position available.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.356
- But I have come_
all the way from Berlin,

14:47.400 --> 14:50.051
and I hear such wonderful things
about your company--

14:50.100 --> 14:53.228
the tech architecture,
undthe UX design...

14:53.280 --> 14:55.236
It really is out
of this world.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.885
- Ja.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.101
- Yeah. Well,

15:00.160 --> 15:04.153
take a seat, let's
figure this out.
- OK, ja, ja.

15:04.200 --> 15:08.022
I'm in.
- Copy that. You're up.

15:12.380 --> 15:14.644
- Ja,Germany. We make the cars.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.732
- Ja, ja.

15:28.490 --> 15:30.390
- Hello.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.015
You have a package
for Mr. Raymond West.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.312
- I have a package
for Mr. Raymond West.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.974
- OK. You can just put it
on the pile right over there.

15:39.020 --> 15:41.534
- [Tell her you need
a signature.]

15:41.590 --> 15:43.490
- Uh, sorry,

15:43.550 --> 15:45.586
I need Mr. West to sign for it.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.108
- Oh, that's not
how we do things here.

15:49.420 --> 15:52.981
- Show her the label.
- Um... oh,

15:53.030 --> 15:55.988
this package is actually
a little bit sensitive.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.168
It's not the kind of thing
you want every Tom, Dick
and mailroom employee

15:59.210 --> 16:01.349
knowing about,
if you catch my drift.

16:01.390 --> 16:04.120
- OK... hold on.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.045
- This is impressive.
- Ja,thank you.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.138
- Graduate of MIT.
- Ja.

16:08.180 --> 16:12.002
- Did you get a chance
to work with Dr. Kashani?
- I did. He's very impressive.

16:12.050 --> 16:14.268
- She.

16:14.320 --> 16:16.265
Dr. Kashani's a woman.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.356
- Ja. Ja.

16:18.410 --> 16:20.446
How long ago were you there?

16:20.500 --> 16:24.015
Maybe you find she's made
some... changes,

16:24.070 --> 16:26.675
if you know what I'm saying.

16:26.720 --> 16:30.326
- I do. Gotcha. Had me there.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.450
Excuse me for a moment.

16:32.510 --> 16:34.466
Hello?
]

16:34.510 --> 16:36.421
You have a package down here
you have to sign for.

16:36.470 --> 16:38.335
- But I'm right in the middle
of a meeting right now.

16:38.380 --> 16:40.553
- [Apparently it's
quite sensitive.]

16:40.600 --> 16:42.648
- OK, I'll... I'll come down.

16:42.690 --> 16:46.342
I'm so sorry,
Mr. Rademacher,

16:46.390 --> 16:48.438
apparently there's a package
waiting for me downstairs

16:48.480 --> 16:51.301
and I must sign for it.
I'll be right back.

16:51.350 --> 16:53.352
You're OK here?
- Oh ja, ja. Danke.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.527
- OK. Two minutes.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.315
- Well done, Zoe.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.533
[Now I just need
to clone the card.]

17:18.380 --> 17:20.336
I got it. Keep him busy.

17:20.380 --> 17:22.905
- OK, I'll do my best.

17:29.170 --> 17:31.821
- This place is a maze.
Which way am I going?

17:31.870 --> 17:35.135
- Uh, gimme a second. Uh, OK.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.354
Take the long corridor down
the west side of the building.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.308
- Mm-hmm.

17:49.370 --> 17:52.885
Yeah, no, it's OK.
I've got time now.

17:54.940 --> 17:58.501
- It's right over there.
- Uh-huh, yeah.

17:58.550 --> 18:01.246
Oh, I understand,
Barry.

18:01.290 --> 18:03.724
Just one second.

18:18.350 --> 18:20.784
- I'm blocked. You're gonna
have to keep stalling.

18:20.830 --> 18:23.481
- Got it.

18:23.530 --> 18:25.839
- Excuse me.
Can I just sign for that?

18:25.880 --> 18:28.269
I gotta go.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.311
OK. Bye-bye.

18:30.370 --> 18:33.237
Ah... sorry about that.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.191
My bosses are being a real drag.

18:37.370 --> 18:40.328
I just need you to sign

18:40.380 --> 18:43.508
right there.

18:46.510 --> 18:48.296
And um...

18:48.340 --> 18:51.298
there.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.737
And also back of the page.

19:09.710 --> 19:12.349
OK, great.

19:12.410 --> 19:15.277
I guess that's it,
then, except...

19:15.320 --> 19:18.619
your fingerprint.

19:18.670 --> 19:20.626
What do you need
my fingerprint for?

19:20.680 --> 19:23.148
- Hey, I don't make the rules.

19:27.340 --> 19:31.117
Oh my God, it's you!

19:31.170 --> 19:33.377
Shadow? What are you
doing here?

19:35.520 --> 19:38.774
Is this the bathroom?
- No, it's not the bathroom.

19:38.820 --> 19:41.175
Come on.

19:41.220 --> 19:43.472
Shadow! I can't
believe it's you!

19:43.530 --> 19:46.306
- Gimme the package.
Just gimme the package.

19:46.350 --> 19:48.614
Just gimme the package.
Let me see! Let me see!
- No, no, no, no.

19:48.660 --> 19:52.266
Forget it.
Keep it.
- Wait--

19:52.320 --> 19:56.438
- If it's that important,
they'll send it again.
- No! I'm gonna get in trouble!

19:56.490 --> 19:59.618
- I saw that game where you hit
Stuart Bodkins behind the play,

19:59.670 --> 20:02.104
and the crowd screaming looking
at the replay, freaking out.

20:02.150 --> 20:04.106
- Angie, I couldn't stop him.
He's heading back upstairs.

20:04.150 --> 20:06.493
You have
to get out of there.

20:06.550 --> 20:09.508
- Hey, thanks. Listen, can I
get you an autographed
picture or something?

20:09.550 --> 20:11.893
I'm in a bit of a hurry.
- Yeah, sure!

20:11.940 --> 20:14.591
I've got--
- No, no, I'll bring it
next time I'm here, OK?

20:14.640 --> 20:17.336
Next time!

20:25.000 --> 20:27.252
- Yeah, you know what,

20:27.310 --> 20:30.655
I just found out my father's
wiener schnitzelrestaurant
has just burned

20:30.700 --> 20:33.260
to the ground. I must go
right away. Guten Tag.

20:33.310 --> 20:37.314
- OK, uh...
- Danke schon!

20:42.670 --> 20:45.275
- I don't understand.
You were caught

20:45.330 --> 20:48.413
and they let you go?
- Not caught, exactly.

20:48.460 --> 20:50.360
Recognised.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.502
- Shade's a former
professional hockey player.

20:52.550 --> 20:55.940
- I couldn't do it.
West had already seen me.

20:55.990 --> 21:00.290
The bottom line is we have
blown our cover. We can't get

21:00.340 --> 21:03.298
anywhere near Summit Path.
- You can't give up now.

21:03.340 --> 21:07.344
You guys are so close.
- I'm really sorry, Dana.

21:14.790 --> 21:18.317
- Thank you, I...
I know you guys tried.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.548
- I don't know what
I was thinking. I never
should've gone in there.

21:35.590 --> 21:37.546
- [It's not your fault.
Besides,]

21:37.600 --> 21:39.818
your fame has helped us
in the past.

21:39.860 --> 21:41.760
Yes, I just admitted that.

21:41.820 --> 21:44.641
Dana's right, we can't
just abandon her.

21:44.690 --> 21:47.944
- I don't know, but at this
point we've run out of options.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.820
- Hey, listen, I gotta go.
We're having

21:49.870 --> 21:52.600
a special dinner for Jules.
She's leaving for Italy.

21:52.650 --> 21:56.347
Say bye for me. Tell her
I'll miss her.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.619
- Just call it my special sauce.

21:59.660 --> 22:03.130
Well, I hope
the dinner was OK.

22:03.190 --> 22:05.181
I'm not a gourmet chef
yet, I guess.

22:05.230 --> 22:07.312
- I thought it was
inspired, Don.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.316
I should have you on the show.
- Oh, thanks so much.

22:09.370 --> 22:12.453
- Yeah.

22:12.500 --> 22:15.105
- My coat.
- I do.

22:15.150 --> 22:17.539
- How about some noise-
cancelling headphones?
I think I got an old pair

22:17.590 --> 22:20.286
kicking around here somewhere.
- Dad, I got this,

22:20.330 --> 22:22.946
OK?
- OK.

22:22.990 --> 22:26.460
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Not nearly as much
as I'm gonna miss you.

22:28.340 --> 22:30.296
You're gonna have
a blast, honey.

22:30.340 --> 22:32.296
Italy is gonna change your life.

22:32.350 --> 22:36.958
Oh, I almost forgot.
I got you something.
- You didn't have to do that.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.958
- Yeah, I know.
Open it. I figured

22:40.010 --> 22:42.308
you're getting a little bit
older now; it's probably
time that we updated

22:42.360 --> 22:45.170
that "Code" necklace
I gave you last year.

22:46.930 --> 22:49.353
- "Don't forget
to spread your wings".

22:50.450 --> 22:52.793
Thanks, Dad, I love it.

22:54.370 --> 22:57.749
Um...

22:57.810 --> 23:00.415
About Liam--

23:00.460 --> 23:03.281
It's OK. It's not my business.
I shouldn't have stuck my nose--

23:03.330 --> 23:06.288
- No, it's not just that.
- OK, sweetie, we really
gotta get going.

23:06.340 --> 23:09.332
- OK. Well...
- Bye, baby.

23:09.380 --> 23:11.519
- I'll call you when
I get there, OK?

23:11.560 --> 23:13.596
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

23:13.650 --> 23:17.427
Love you. Love you both.
- Love you too.

23:24.830 --> 23:27.958
- Did I really just send my
daughter 4,000 miles away?

23:28.010 --> 23:30.740
- She's gonna be fine.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.098
It's you I'm worried about.

23:39.980 --> 23:43.279
You gotta help me.

23:54.340 --> 23:58.208
What's wrong?
- I know it's late, but
I needed to talk to you.

24:01.350 --> 24:04.251
I saw that when I got home.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.266
It's West.

24:06.310 --> 24:08.266
He's still watching me.
I don't know what to do.

24:08.310 --> 24:10.744
- You need to take this
to the police.

24:10.790 --> 24:13.224
- I can't. It wouldn't
do any good.

24:13.270 --> 24:16.797
I don't have any real proof,
and even if I... even if I...

24:16.840 --> 24:20.310
I'm sorry.

24:27.680 --> 24:31.150
I'm sorry.

24:33.510 --> 24:35.466
It's just... my dad is sick.

24:35.510 --> 24:37.683
If those photos

24:37.730 --> 24:41.905
get released and it's the last
thing that he sees...

24:47.700 --> 24:49.258
Is that your dad?

24:49.310 --> 24:51.266
I didn't mean to--

24:51.310 --> 24:53.835
- No, no, it's OK.

24:53.880 --> 24:57.839
- I know that you said
your cover was blown,

24:57.880 --> 25:00.314
but West is the only one
that saw you.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.271
If you went back in tonight--

25:02.320 --> 25:04.276
- You still have a key card.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.276
West wouldn't be there.

25:06.330 --> 25:09.197
- I... I can't ask
Shade to do that

25:09.240 --> 25:12.630
a second time.
- Then don't.

25:13.990 --> 25:17.721
No disrespect to your partner,
Angie, but...

25:17.770 --> 25:21.558
he doesn't know what it's like
to be a woman in a man's world.

25:21.600 --> 25:24.421
I can't let this happen
to someone else.

25:24.470 --> 25:27.030
- Dana, I...

25:27.090 --> 25:29.217
I wanna help, but...

25:29.260 --> 25:31.911
didn't you say that there are
sensors that kick in
after hours?

25:31.960 --> 25:34.781
- You're right.

25:34.830 --> 25:36.821
I'm sorry, I forgot.

25:36.880 --> 25:40.259
I... I just haven't been
thinking clearly

25:40.320 --> 25:43.403
with everything, with my dad...

25:45.320 --> 25:47.493
I'm sorry.

25:49.370 --> 25:53.010
- Wait. Just... wait.

25:54.980 --> 25:57.676
You know, there's one thing
that my dad taught me.

25:57.730 --> 26:00.335
It's never to back down
from a fight.

26:00.380 --> 26:02.280
What's the lag time
on those sensors?

26:02.340 --> 26:06.720
- Well, I'm assuming
there's a built-in protocol

26:06.780 --> 26:10.250
to prevent false
alarms, so...

26:10.300 --> 26:14.179
why don't you walk me through
what happens when they're
triggered?

26:19.050 --> 26:21.006
- Are you sure this is
the same puck?

26:21.050 --> 26:22.961
- Well, it says it. I mean,

26:23.010 --> 26:25.399
"The Cup-winning puck
from game 5

26:25.450 --> 26:27.611
of the 1951 Stanley Cup
playoffs". I mean, I knew

26:27.670 --> 26:30.138
he was gonna sell it.
The bid's up to $7,000.

26:30.190 --> 26:32.715
- Have you tried talking
to the guy

26:32.760 --> 26:35.547
Maybe if they understood
the sentimental value
this thing has for you...?

26:35.590 --> 26:38.058
That's why they're selling it.

26:38.110 --> 26:40.578
Look, Randy works
at Baycroft Arena.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.596
Guaranteed that's
where he's hiding it.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.200
If you distract him,
I can run in and grab it.

26:45.250 --> 26:47.241
How am I supposed
to do that?

26:47.300 --> 26:50.258
- You're a legend, Shadow!
Plus, Randy's a huge fan.

26:50.300 --> 26:53.258
He'd be over the moon if you
read him your shopping list.
- Come on.

26:53.300 --> 26:56.258
- You have no idea of
the effect you have on people.

26:56.310 --> 26:59.609
We could wrap this thing up
in 15 minutes, tops.

27:03.140 --> 27:05.096
- OK, fine.

27:05.140 --> 27:07.096
Let me just check in with
my partner real quick, OK?

27:07.140 --> 27:09.267
- Right.
I'll settle up.

27:21.070 --> 27:23.766
- [Hi, it's Angie.
Leave me a message.]

27:51.270 --> 27:55.013
Hey, buddy,
what can I do for ya?

27:55.060 --> 27:57.187
_- I'll rent
this place out.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.231
I'm thinking about putting on
a charity event with
some of the boys.

28:04.290 --> 28:08.499
- Yeah... Here, let me
show you around.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.868
- You're early.

28:17.910 --> 28:20.037
- Yes, well, early bird
catches the worm.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.866
Hope I don't find
any, though.

28:21.910 --> 28:25.209
Don't like worms. Or snakes.
Or basically anything
that slithers.

28:25.260 --> 28:26.818
Anyhoo, I best get crackin',

28:26.870 --> 28:29.828
'cause those toilets are not
gonna clean themselves.

28:29.880 --> 28:32.872
- Uh, hold up.

28:35.270 --> 28:37.738
Where's Maria?
- Maria, right.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.756
She is sick tonight.

28:39.800 --> 28:43.270
- Oh, she was sick last week.
- Yes. Yes, she was.

28:43.330 --> 28:47.061
I keep telling that girl
she's gotta lay off the
all-you-can-eat sushi bars.

28:47.110 --> 28:51.069
- Ew.
- Well, tick tock.

28:56.030 --> 28:59.204
- So, ice time includes
access to the lockers
and the upper Viewmg area.

28:59.250 --> 29:01.298
Of course, Zamboni's extra.

29:01.340 --> 29:05.219
- Hey, um... that scoreboard
is a little outdated,

29:05.260 --> 29:08.218
don't you think?
- They're talking about getting
a new one in the spring,

29:08.260 --> 29:10.865
but they've been saying that
for 3 years running now, so...

29:10.920 --> 29:13.263
Don't worry, though, she still
works like clockwork.

29:13.310 --> 29:15.358
- Right, yeah.
- Hey, um,

29:15.400 --> 29:17.356
you think Doug Gilmour's
gonna come?

29:17.400 --> 29:19.573
- If he doesn't chicken out
like last time.

29:19.620 --> 29:21.759
- I love it.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.756
Man, I can't believe I'm
standing here with Matt Shade.

29:23.800 --> 29:27.270
- Yeah.

29:27.330 --> 29:30.493
- You know, I think
you're running a pretty
tight ship here, Randy.

29:30.550 --> 29:33.451
I'll be in touch.
- Alright, buddy.
Nice to meet you.

29:33.510 --> 29:36.934
- You too.
- Matt Shade.

29:43.120 --> 29:46.863
- Ho, ho, ho! Man, that
was incredible, Shade!

29:46.910 --> 29:49.219
Must be awesome being famous.
People do whatever you want.

29:49.260 --> 29:52.514
- Comes in handy
sometimes, I guess.
- Yeah. Alright,

29:52.570 --> 29:54.731
let's get some beer. It's on me.
- Uh, sure.

29:54.790 --> 29:56.826
Let me just check in
with my partner.

29:56.880 --> 30:00.395
- It's just weird she hasn't
called me.

30:00.450 --> 30:03.180
Let me just try her again.

30:03.230 --> 30:05.573
- [Hi, it's Angie.
Leave me a message.]

30:05.620 --> 30:09.238
Where to?

30:09.280 --> 30:13.455
The only time Angie doesn't
answer her phone

30:15.500 --> 30:17.718
or in trouble.
I'll catch you later.

30:17.770 --> 30:19.761
- OK.

30:40.090 --> 30:42.046
- Yeah, Dave,

30:42.100 --> 30:45.615
I've got an alarm in the lab
on the fifth floor.

31:09.470 --> 31:11.597
- Shit.

31:29.230 --> 31:32.017
- Stupid eggheads. False alarm.

31:32.060 --> 31:33.960
- Copy that.

31:34.020 --> 31:36.238
Let me know when you get
the all-clear and I will reset.

31:39.410 --> 31:42.231
- Let 'em clean up
their own mess, right?

31:44.330 --> 31:47.197
All clear.

31:47.250 --> 31:49.070
- Copy that.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.695
- Yo!

32:08.750 --> 32:11.924
Anybody home?

32:17.930 --> 32:20.239
Angie?

32:26.640 --> 32:28.585
Motion sensors?

32:28.640 --> 32:31.154
No, you didn't.

32:33.250 --> 32:36.777
Yeah, you did.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.918
Whew! Thank you, Dana.

32:59.670 --> 33:01.752
G45.

33:17.290 --> 33:20.032
Where's the key?!

33:38.530 --> 33:42.534
- Shadow.
- I know, twice in one day,
what are the chances, right?

33:42.580 --> 33:44.889
We're closed.

33:44.930 --> 33:47.717
- Two things, actually. One,

33:47.760 --> 33:50.365
I wanted to give you
this. And two,

33:50.410 --> 33:53.322
I actually need a favour.

34:11.390 --> 34:14.041
You know, I really appreciate
your help with this.
:Shade!

34:14.090 --> 34:17.344
- I can't believe that you got
the receptionist to give you
her number and you lost it.

34:17.400 --> 34:21.177
Wait till I tell the guys
that I was able to help
the Shadow score.

34:21.230 --> 34:24.051
- Ha, ha, ha! That's
funny! Ha, ha, ha!

34:24.100 --> 34:26.318
- Where do you think
you dropped it?
- Uh, you know,

34:26.360 --> 34:28.408
I really don't know,

34:28.450 --> 34:30.839
so why don't you check
down there and I'll check
over at this end?

34:30.890 --> 34:32.790
- Alright.

34:32.850 --> 34:35.011
: The card!

34:35.070 --> 34:36.890
The card!

34:44.080 --> 34:46.594
- Oh, hey, here it is!

34:46.640 --> 34:50.337
Foundit
Heh, heh. Ah man,

34:50.390 --> 34:52.346
you really saved my life.
- Pff! It's just my job.

34:54.220 --> 34:56.780
Hey, don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

34:56.830 --> 34:59.173
- I'm feeling that leaves the
playing field pretty wide open.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.661
Let me guess.
You don't do windows.

35:14.720 --> 35:17.621
- I'm not just a pretty face.

35:17.680 --> 35:21.025
- I'm too grateful right now
to argue with you.

35:21.070 --> 35:23.288
- You know, you didn't have
to go in there alone.

35:23.330 --> 35:26.151
- Seemed like the most
logical choice.

35:26.210 --> 35:28.815
Is that _
what you call this?

35:30.860 --> 35:34.125
- Anyhow, it worked out.
Project Marigold.

35:34.170 --> 35:36.126
- Score one for the good guys.

35:37.740 --> 35:40.174
Let's get the hell outta here.

35:52.230 --> 35:55.188
- [Yeah, we got in, like, an
hour ago. Everything's been
great. They're taking us]

35:55.240 --> 35:57.447
[on a tour of the Montepulciano
region tomorrow,]

35:57.500 --> 36:01.197
[which is the second most
planted grape in all of Italy
due to its elevated acidity.]

36:01.240 --> 36:05.199
- Wait a minute, is this a high
school trip or an audition
for the movie Sideways?

36:05.250 --> 36:07.195
- [Yeah, I don't even know
what that means.]

36:07.250 --> 36:09.206
- Of course. Look, honey,
I'm just glad you're happy.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.206
It must be something
in the Tuscan wind.

36:15.210 --> 36:19.169
- [Well... ahem! Remember
when I was trying]

36:25.220 --> 36:27.825
- [A spot opened up.
It was perfect.]

36:27.880 --> 36:30.963
- What do you mean, a spot
opened up? I thought that
this trip had been booked

36:31.010 --> 36:34.446
for months-- You gotta be
kidding me. Really?

36:43.240 --> 36:46.198
- Hey, Shade.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.505
- In Italy, on the other side
of the ocean, with Jules.

36:49.550 --> 36:52.246
I'm sorry,

36:52.290 --> 36:55.817
I shouldn't be laughing. Uh...
how did he pull that off?

36:55.860 --> 36:58.420
- Because he's Liam!
- Liam is a good kid,

36:58.470 --> 37:01.030
you said so yourself. And...

37:01.080 --> 37:03.640
it's nice that Jules has
someone there she can count on.

37:03.690 --> 37:07.126
[It might actually
make you worry less.]
- No. There is no less.

37:07.180 --> 37:10.172
There's only Liam.
- Why don't you meet me here,

37:10.220 --> 37:12.176
we'll go tell Dana
the good news together.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.484
- That's the other reason
I'm calling. Can you
take this one solo?

37:15.530 --> 37:18.181
I gotta meet my buddy's brother
again, he's got a cheque for us.

37:18.230 --> 37:21.188
Two cases solved
and it's not even noon.

37:21.230 --> 37:23.232
It's a good day, Shade.

37:23.280 --> 37:26.238
- Yeah. I'll see you later,
Everett.

37:31.330 --> 37:33.412
- Shadow!

37:33.460 --> 37:35.633
Man of the hour. Man
of the year, actually.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.466
Thank you
very much.

37:37.510 --> 37:39.592
You have no idea what it means
to get that puck back.

37:39.640 --> 37:43.121
- Seems like you needed one
for the win column.
- Yeah, I kind of did.

37:43.170 --> 37:45.479
- I gotta run.

37:45.520 --> 37:47.647
I just wanted to make sure
you got this.
- Thanks.

37:47.700 --> 37:50.954
- I'll give you a call next
week, OK? Oh, and good luck

37:51.000 --> 37:54.299
finding that girl's photos.
- Hey.

37:54.350 --> 37:57.171
How d'you know about that?

37:57.230 --> 38:00.449
- The photos.
- From you. The other night.

38:00.490 --> 38:03.004
- No, I just told you

38:03.060 --> 38:05.961
I was working on a sexual
harassment case. I never
mentioned the photos.

38:06.020 --> 38:09.490
- My bad. Listen,
I'm late for work.

38:09.540 --> 38:12.191
Don't be a stranger.

38:18.770 --> 38:22.558
- Hey.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.465
do me a favour.

38:24.510 --> 38:27.206
Go on the Hillcrest Ravens'
website._Ther_e's
an alumni section.

38:31.390 --> 38:34.120
- Didn't find anything.

38:39.530 --> 38:42.351
- Search Dan Chambers.
What's his brother's name?

38:44.360 --> 38:48.182
- Uh, says here he has
a sister, Kim. No brother.

38:48.230 --> 38:50.539
- You did it.

38:50.580 --> 38:52.923
Everything you promised.
Thank you.

38:52.980 --> 38:56.325
- Well, I'd be lying
if I said it wasn't fun.

38:56.370 --> 39:00.158
- Hey, your friend at the
employment office, did he ever
send over Dana's file?

39:00.200 --> 39:04.113
- Do a search with that name
and address.

39:07.210 --> 39:09.986
- That can't be right.

39:10.040 --> 39:11.996
It's showing a Dana Edson

39:12.040 --> 39:14.213
that worked at Summit Path,
but it's not our Dana.

39:15.220 --> 39:17.347
- I knew I chose the right
person for the job.

39:17.390 --> 39:21.133
- It was a team effort.
Shade helped.
- Yeah, but you finished it.

39:21.180 --> 39:23.785
- Us girls, we have
to stick together.

39:23.830 --> 39:26.788
- Alright, text me the address
where she's meeting her.

39:26.840 --> 39:29.968
If Angie calls in, tell her not
to give Dana that hard drive.

39:30.010 --> 39:33.446
- This is for you.

39:33.500 --> 39:36.139
I'll never forget this, Angie.

39:36.190 --> 39:39.011
You have no idea
how much this means.

39:46.030 --> 39:49.636
- Hey, Shade.

39:49.690 --> 39:51.646
- It's a scam.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.555
did you have one too many
Bloody Marys

39:53.600 --> 39:57.127
]
- No, he's not my pal.
He was working with Dana.

39:57.170 --> 39:59.081
They were keeping us apart
to split our focus.

40:00.830 --> 40:02.912
- Please tell me you didn't
give her the hard drive.

40:04.310 --> 40:07.131
- Oh, my God.

40:13.930 --> 40:16.626
- Put your hands up!
- Hands up!

40:16.670 --> 40:19.138
- Drop the phone! Now!

40:19.190 --> 40:21.146
Angie!

40:46.350 --> 40:49.615
- So ready.

41:18.990 --> 41:21.458
These Fed guys are
a little intense.

41:23.430 --> 41:26.900
Excuse me. I'm Detective
Kurtis Mazhari. We called
about Angie Everett?

41:26.960 --> 41:29.121
- Shade.

41:29.180 --> 41:33.082
- She's in holding.
- Thank you.

41:33.140 --> 41:36.223
- Sergeant Ellis.

41:36.270 --> 41:38.613
Federal Intelligence.
- Well, you're half right.

41:38.670 --> 41:42.401
- Shade! Remember what we talked
about 30 seconds ago?
- You're wasting your time.

41:42.450 --> 41:46.272
You have no jurisdiction here.
Come on,
it can't be that serious.

41:46.320 --> 41:48.322
- Miss Everett's being
charged with espionage.

41:48.370 --> 41:51.100
OK, let's
slow down for a second.
- That's insane!

41:51.160 --> 41:54.379
- Summit Path Tech
has a contract with
the Defense Department.

41:54.420 --> 41:56.763
Your partner stole
top secret data.

41:56.810 --> 41:58.539
- Listen, Joe Friday,

41:58.600 --> 42:01.160
I don't care what you think
you have. My partner was set up.

42:01.210 --> 42:04.122
- I gotta give those analysts
credit, you know. They nailed
you to a T.

42:04.170 --> 42:07.731
Belligerent, they said.
A loose cannon. Cowboy.

42:07.780 --> 42:12.080
- What, is that supposed
to intimidate me?
- No, it's not, but this is.

42:12.130 --> 42:15.133
I know you were at Summit
Path twice yesterday.

42:15.180 --> 42:17.136
The only reason I haven't
charged you as an accessory

42:17.180 --> 42:19.136
is because I don't have
enough eVIdence.

42:19.180 --> 42:23.184
Yet. _
- I want to see Angie.

42:41.510 --> 42:44.115
Hey. You OK?

42:44.170 --> 42:46.161
- Yeah, I'm fine.

42:50.650 --> 42:52.606
Shade, they're saying that I...

42:52.650 --> 42:54.914
- Yeah, I know.
Ellis told me.

42:54.960 --> 42:57.087
It's gonna be OK.

42:59.140 --> 43:01.096
How did I--
- No, it wasn't just you.

43:01.140 --> 43:03.916
She has us both fooled,
and she had help.

43:03.970 --> 43:07.269
That guy pretending to be
my buddy's brother--
he was in on it too.

43:07.320 --> 43:10.050
- So the whole thing,

43:10.100 --> 43:12.409
sexual harassment,
invasion of privacy,

43:12.450 --> 43:14.406
her father's illness--
- It was all fake.

43:14.460 --> 43:18.328
She knew it would push your
buttons, so she exploited it.

43:22.330 --> 43:24.981
- Oh, you've got to believe

43:25.030 --> 43:27.294
- I'm gonna get you out of here.

43:27.340 --> 43:31.128
- Yeah, I've got to concede

43:31.170 --> 43:33.297
I'm under your spell

43:33.340 --> 43:35.729
Spell

43:35.780 --> 43:37.259
