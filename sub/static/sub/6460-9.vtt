WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:04.103
Got a marriage proposal
in the diner.

00:04.105 --> 00:07.172
Where they gonna honeymoon--
a Porta-Potty?

00:07.174 --> 00:09.074
That's the saddest thing
I ever seen,

00:09.076 --> 00:12.978
and I was at a Rolling Stones
concert last night.

00:12.980 --> 00:15.014
The guy wants me to put
this ring her pie.

00:15.016 --> 00:16.482
'Cause you know what they say--

00:16.484 --> 00:20.152
If you like it, then you gotta
put a ring in it.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.187
Well, this is a first.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.890
A guy left me a half
a tuna sandwich as a tip.

00:24.892 --> 00:28.994
Which is still more
than Europeans leave.

00:28.996 --> 00:31.463
There's a proposal
at table 40,

00:31.465 --> 00:33.298
and you have to do it.

00:33.300 --> 00:37.002
I already delivered
a baby in here today.

00:37.004 --> 00:39.138
Well, they've obviously
been dating a while,

00:39.140 --> 00:41.840
'cause she's eating carbs
in front of him.

00:41.842 --> 00:44.176
Caroline
is so happy right now.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.578
She still believes
in all that love crap.

00:46.580 --> 00:50.582
Uh, she also believes
table 14 is table 40.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.451
Here's your pie.

00:52.453 --> 00:57.089
I have a feeling this dessert
is gonna be extra-sweet.

00:59.459 --> 01:01.560
It's an engagement ring!

01:01.562 --> 01:04.696
He hid it in the pie!

01:04.698 --> 01:06.999
Yes! Yes, I'll marry you.

01:07.001 --> 01:08.834
I know I said I was
cool with waiting,

01:08.836 --> 01:11.270
but I wasn't cool with it!

01:12.505 --> 01:16.475
Yep. She messed up.
This isn't yours.

01:17.844 --> 01:22.014
Um...again.
I'm cool with waiting.

01:22.016 --> 01:25.451
And for you two,
pie on the house,

01:25.453 --> 01:29.088
and I'm guessing a very
tense cab ride home.

Where's Earl?
He isn't here yet,

01:46.474 --> 01:47.906
and I'm worried.

01:47.908 --> 01:51.343
Wait--it's not
a black holiday, is it?

01:51.345 --> 01:54.713
Earl better not be dead,
or I'll kill him.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.849
We have a joint
suicide pact.

01:56.851 --> 01:59.718
We smoke a joint
and then we kill ourselves.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.055
He's probably just late.
Don't overreact.

02:03.057 --> 02:05.724
That's exactly what Janine
at 911 said ten minutes ago

02:05.726 --> 02:07.960
when I overreacted
with her!

02:07.962 --> 02:09.495
You called 911?

02:09.497 --> 02:11.663
When I came home
three hours late last night,

02:11.665 --> 02:14.967
you had already put
all my stuff out on the street.

02:14.969 --> 02:17.236
Hi, everybody!

02:18.705 --> 02:21.473
Wait a minute--
where's Earl?

02:21.475 --> 02:23.408
It's not as much fun
walking in here

02:23.410 --> 02:27.246
if he's not down there
looking up at my boobs.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.081
He's late.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.749
[gasps]
Late?

02:30.751 --> 02:32.818
Oh...I'm sorry, Max.

02:32.820 --> 02:36.321
I know you two
were close.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.991
See? That's the kind of
sympathy I was looking for

02:38.993 --> 02:42.027
from you and Janine.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.896
Sophie,
what's with those needles?

02:43.898 --> 02:47.132
Oh, yeah--I'm getting ready
to shoot up.

02:47.134 --> 02:50.135
Sophie's starting
her fertility shots today.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.004
Before long,
we'll be parents.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.739
Look out, PTA meetings...

02:53.741 --> 02:57.276
I'll bring the P.
She'll bring the T&A.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.411
All right, come on, Oleg.
I'm ready for my first shot.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.079
Come on, let's go
to the ladies' room

03:01.081 --> 03:03.148
so you can poke me
real good.

03:03.150 --> 03:06.485
You're not poking her
anywhere in here.

03:06.487 --> 03:11.190
Thanks to you, the handicap
stall is a condom graveyard!

03:11.192 --> 03:14.159
Sophie, you know I'm only
afraid of two things--

03:14.161 --> 03:18.163
needles and Kenny Rogers
after the eyelift.

03:18.165 --> 03:20.966
He did not know
when to fold 'em.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.736
Someone else will have to
give you your shots.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.605
Well, I guess I could do it.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.006
Roll up your sleeve.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.142
Okay, yeah.

03:30.144 --> 03:33.178
I'll roll up my sleeve...
and then pull down my Spanx,

03:33.180 --> 03:37.549
'cause you gotta put it
where the sun don't shine, baby.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.185
Uh...this is a little
awkward, but Sophie,

03:40.187 --> 03:45.023
I was unaware I'd be
injecting your badonkadonk.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.792
Okay, Han.

03:46.794 --> 03:49.228
Take my hand...

03:49.230 --> 03:51.463
That's right.
Mm-hmm.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.932
That's real good.
All right, come on.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.334
And I'm gonna take you now

03:55.336 --> 03:58.604
to show you
your first lady butt.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.410
Now, there's
a heart-warming tableau

04:05.412 --> 04:08.146
that Norman Rockwell
somehow missed.

04:08.148 --> 04:10.482
Hello, ladies.

04:10.484 --> 04:13.585
Earl!
I'm so glad you're alive.

04:13.587 --> 04:17.022
You always go
straight to dead, Max.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.591
But thanks for sending
the paramedics.

04:19.593 --> 04:23.328
I needed help finding
my Apple TV remote.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.531
I was stuck on the phone
with Barry

04:26.533 --> 04:29.268
from my old jazz band
The Early Birds.

04:29.270 --> 04:32.437
You may have read about us
in "Never Made It" magazine.

04:32.439 --> 04:36.375
Caroline and I were on
the cover last week.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.810
He told me they're holding
an anniversary show

04:38.812 --> 04:40.212
down at Ruby's,

04:40.214 --> 04:42.114
and The Early Birds
are invited to perform

04:42.116 --> 04:43.615
on Friday night.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.018
[gasps]
Earl!

04:46.020 --> 04:49.521
One of my dreams
is to hear you play live.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.156
And the other one
already happened--

04:51.158 --> 04:54.259
breakfast all day
at McDonald's.

04:54.261 --> 04:56.328
Well, I hate to burst
your McMuffin, Max,

04:56.330 --> 04:57.996
but that ain't
gonna happen,

04:57.998 --> 04:59.931
'cause I'm not
invited to play.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.800
Ruby doesn't want me
there.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.769
Ruby hates Earl.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.872
Well, then Max hates Ruby.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.808
Oh! What happened
between you and Ruby?

05:09.810 --> 05:11.910
Was it a crazy
love affair?

05:11.912 --> 05:15.213
Mm-hmm. We were hot.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.816
Oh! An amour fou?

05:17.818 --> 05:21.286
No, it was a-more I fooled
around with her sister.

05:26.659 --> 05:29.528
Look! [gasps]
Earl and The Early Birds!

05:29.530 --> 05:31.963
- Where'd you get that?
- I went down the street

05:31.965 --> 05:33.865
to Smart & Vinyl.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.367
12.95.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.469
You spent 12.95
on Earl's record,

05:37.471 --> 05:42.574
but you wouldn't lend me
25¢ for a latte yesterday?

05:42.576 --> 05:44.743
Look, we gotta do
something about Earl.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.745
He deserves to play
at that jazz club.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.081
I mean, he is the only one
at this diner

05:49.083 --> 05:51.450
who has a chance
to make it.

05:52.819 --> 05:55.454
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but of all of us here,

05:55.456 --> 05:59.324
you think the 80-year-old
has the brightest future?

05:59.326 --> 06:00.892
For as long as
I've known Earl,

06:00.894 --> 06:03.195
all he talked about is how proud
he was of that band.

06:03.197 --> 06:04.529
And that Ruby woman

06:04.531 --> 06:06.965
is denying him the chance
to play again?

06:06.967 --> 06:08.233
Not on my watch.

06:08.235 --> 06:10.035
If I own one.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.372
Which...I do not.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.606
We are going down
to that club

06:14.608 --> 06:16.408
and talk some sense
into Ruby,

06:16.410 --> 06:19.277
because Earl would do the same
for us if we had any talent.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.812
I just have to ask--

06:20.814 --> 06:23.248
you do think we're gonna
get out of here one day.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.649
Oh, for sure!

06:24.651 --> 06:27.285
In body bags.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.996
Wow, this place
is the real deal!

06:37.998 --> 06:40.265
All the jazz greats
sang here.

06:40.267 --> 06:43.735
Look--Ella Fitzgerald,
Sarah Vaughan, Nina Simone.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.537
You know, there was a moment
when I wanted to be--

06:45.539 --> 06:48.473
Was there ever a moment
when you wanted to be quiet?

06:50.009 --> 06:52.444
Scotch on the house, please.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.813
Normally, I don't drink
in the afternoon,

06:54.815 --> 06:56.782
but it's still morning.

06:58.117 --> 06:59.951
I'll have a Lillet.

06:59.953 --> 07:02.087
I hear it was
Billie Holiday's poison.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.321
You know, there was
a moment when I was--

07:03.323 --> 07:05.424
That moment's over.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.292
Sir, we're here
to see Ruby.

07:07.294 --> 07:10.595
Who wants to see Ruby?

07:12.999 --> 07:14.466
She's coming in real hot,
Max.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.368
Maybe this
isn't a good idea.

07:16.370 --> 07:18.136
There's only one old
woman who scares me,

07:18.138 --> 07:20.972
and his name
is Steven Tyler.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.174
I'm Ruby.

07:22.176 --> 07:23.675
Well...if it isn't

07:23.677 --> 07:27.145
"Miss doesn't invite
people to stuff."

07:27.147 --> 07:30.482
Who's also known as
Miss Very, Very Pretty.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.918
I don't need someone
to tell me that I'm pretty.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.386
That's what I told Roy Orbison

07:34.388 --> 07:36.621
when he wrote "Pretty Woman
for me.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.190
What do you little girls
want?

07:38.192 --> 07:40.425
We're friends of Earl.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.993
- Of Earl?
- You know, Earl.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.528
From The Early Birds.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.831
You know, the guy who put
this club on the map.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.766
Oh, that Earl!

07:47.768 --> 07:50.268
He's a bum!

07:50.270 --> 07:52.771
Girl, you better
check yourself!

07:54.640 --> 07:57.242
No one says anything bad
about my Earl.

07:57.244 --> 08:00.412
Your Ear--Well, I prefer
not to go to jail

08:00.414 --> 08:03.014
for murdering Earl's
girlfriend, but...

08:03.016 --> 08:04.816
it's not that strong
a preference.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.084
Here, hold my hoops!

08:06.086 --> 08:07.385
Oh, no, no, no, no.

08:07.387 --> 08:09.354
Max isn't Earl's girlfriend.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.189
He's more like
a father-figure to her.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.925
More like
a great-grandfather figure!

08:13.927 --> 08:16.695
He's both!
Hold my hoops!

08:17.763 --> 08:20.165
Everybody calm down,
take a beat.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.334
A jazzy beat, of course.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.369
I only have
two questions for you--

08:24.371 --> 08:25.537
Why is she so upset?

08:25.539 --> 08:27.739
And what the hell
is a jazzy beat?

08:27.741 --> 08:31.443
I'm upset because I know
Earl helped build this club,

08:31.445 --> 08:34.446
and he wasn't invited
to play your anniversary show.

08:34.448 --> 08:36.882
That's right--
'cause he's a bum!

08:36.884 --> 08:38.884
Hold my hoops again!

08:38.886 --> 08:41.386
That no-good, two-timin'
musical genius

08:41.388 --> 08:43.755
will never set foot
in my club while I'm alive.

08:43.757 --> 08:47.292
Here, hold my hoops while
I unstrap the pistol on my shoe.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.462
Ruby, come on,
can't you just let him play?

08:50.464 --> 08:53.365
I mean, he's just a cashier
at a diner now.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.133
What'd you just call him?

08:55.135 --> 08:57.536
Earl is more than
just a cashier.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.504
That is his job,
not what he is.

08:59.506 --> 09:00.972
How <i>dare</i> you!

09:00.974 --> 09:02.807
Yeah, how dare she!

09:02.809 --> 09:05.010
both: Hold my hoops!

09:05.012 --> 09:07.445
Hold your hoops!
I'm sorry.

09:07.447 --> 09:10.282
He's not a cashier.
He's a musical genius.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.717
Damn it.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.853
I can't believe
that Earl would end up

09:14.855 --> 09:17.789
in a dead-end job
as a cashier in a diner.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.525
Well, I mean, it doesn't
have to be a dead-end.

09:20.527 --> 09:21.860
He could get out anytime--

09:21.862 --> 09:25.063
him and the other people
that work there.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.631
All right, he can come.

09:26.633 --> 09:29.601
But just make sure
he shows up <i>and</i> he is sober.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.002
That man only has
two settings--

09:31.004 --> 09:34.339
"high off his ass"
or "not in the room."

09:35.708 --> 09:36.942
He'll be here.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.344
Okay, I don't know
whose hoops are whose.

09:39.346 --> 09:42.647
We got a real
"whose hoops" over here.

09:46.886 --> 09:48.086
Isn't that exciting,
Earl?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.888
You're playing
at the club!

09:49.890 --> 09:52.290
I'm gonna go ahead
and call it a comeback.

09:52.292 --> 09:56.061
And then I'm gonna go find
an outfit that I can take back.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.363
So, Earl, obviously,
I'll be your date,

09:58.365 --> 10:01.433
and obviously, we'll pretend
that we don't know Caroline.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.235
I can't believe
that you girls went to see Ruby

10:04.237 --> 10:08.406
and came back
with your hoops and hair.

10:08.408 --> 10:12.210
But there's one problem:
I no longer own a saxophone.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.446
How can you not
own a saxophone?
