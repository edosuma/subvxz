00:13.334 --> 00:16.583
It is the year 2546.

00:16.584 --> 00:22.875
This era's technical advances have made it possible
for the entertainment industry to flourish.

00:22.876 --> 00:27.708
First-person virtual reality, the
successor of movies and video games,

00:27.709 --> 00:34.666
offers adventures and luxurious relaxation
scenarios that exceed all previous expectations.

00:34.667 --> 00:39.791
Virtual reality is the pinnacle of
the entertainment industry-

00:39.792 --> 00:44.875
- and, as it turns out, the most addictive
drug ever known to mankind.

00:44.876 --> 00:49.166
People seeking respite from the
existential problems of the physical world

00:49.167 --> 00:53.876
are spending their last credits to fund
the continuance of their dream worlds.

00:54.876 --> 01:02.875
Two rival corporations rule the market, Global
Corporation G and Global Corporation I.

01:02.876 --> 01:10.416
The latter has created a secret, closed virtual reality,
filled with personal memories, archival material,

01:10.417 --> 01:15.375
and early “gaming” programs and development
documents from the past millennium.

01:16.417 --> 01:24.334
They have managed to reconstruct an era of which we thought all
memories and records were lost in the first world cyber-war.

01:25.709 --> 01:31.541
They have re-created the 1980's, which
witnessed the birth of video game development,

01:31.542 --> 01:38.041
an event in which a politically and economically
restricted small European country, Hungary,

01:38.042 --> 01:41.209
had a significant role.

01:43.667 --> 01:50.666
My name is AMI, the Global Corporation
G's Artificial Main Intelligence.

01:50.667 --> 01:56.041
As a 41-25 agent, your mission
is to get into GCI's systems

01:56.042 --> 02:00.750
and gather all the information related
to historical game development.

02:00.751 --> 02:06.166
There are numerous traps and security
measures built into their reality construct,

02:06.167 --> 02:11.041
including an automated
network disconnect every 2 hours.

02:11.042 --> 02:16.124
If you do not make it out in time,
your consciousness will be trapped there.

02:16.125 --> 02:19.917
We have introduced an investigative
survey program into their system

02:19.918 --> 02:23.583
that will assist you by
providing reference information.

02:23.584 --> 02:29.626
Pay attention to detail and be cautious.
Report all information you acquire.

02:55.584 --> 02:59.041
Ami, I am in the system.
Check the network connection!

02:59.042 --> 03:01.500
Network connection is stable.

03:01.501 --> 03:07.042
Search for our investigative survey
program and start acquiring information.

03:09.834 --> 03:16.750
In the eighties, Hungary was a part of Comecon and
under the strict influence of the Soviet Union.

03:16.751 --> 03:27.750
This is why the evolution of strong East-West
export-import activity was so special;

03:27.751 --> 03:33.458
You could practically say that Hungarian
industrial game development evolved independently.

03:33.459 --> 03:37.666
This industry had two key figures.

03:37.667 --> 03:41.958
One of them is a gentleman
named Robert Stein,

03:41.959 --> 03:48.958
who defected to England in the fifties
and created a company called Andromeda.

03:48.959 --> 03:55.541
The other is Gábor Rényi,
who led the company Novotrade.

03:55.542 --> 04:03.249
Novotrade would create games here in Hungary, and
Stein's company would find them Western partners.

04:03.250 --> 04:11.249
Novotrade, due to socialist legislation at the time, shouldn't
have been able to form as Hungary's first joint-stock company.

04:11.250 --> 04:18.750
Rényi essentially created a company that was
otherwise inconceivable in socialist countries.

04:18.750 --> 04:28.374
For some reason, during the socialist years, Hungary's
legislators never repealed the 1870 trade law.

04:28.375 --> 04:35.875
So there was a law in effect
that allowed the company to form,

04:35.876 --> 04:39.875
even though none of the ministries
wanted to know about us,

04:39.876 --> 04:45.750
and we received a classification from the Bureau
of Statistics that made our affiliation unclear.

04:45.751 --> 04:51.249
I'm not saying it was done in a professional manner, because
there was no professionalism in Hungary at the time,

04:51.250 --> 04:54.291
but a lot of things were
done in very clever ways.

04:54.292 --> 05:01.583
We're talking about the first ever Hungarian joint-stock
company. Don't imagine this as a skyscraper from New York,

05:01.584 --> 05:08.166
but as a cellar. Okay, a basement, not a cellar,
but essentially they renovated a cellar.

05:08.167 --> 05:10.959
Which is rather surprising.

05:14.834 --> 05:21.124
Ami, I'm on my way to England in a Spitfire fighter
plane simulator developed by Hungarians in 1985.

05:21.125 --> 05:26.166
I'm on a mission to figure out what led Robert Stein to
enter the game industry at the beginning of the eighties.

05:26.167 --> 05:30.917
What I know so far is that Stein was distributing
chess computers when he met David Bishop.

05:30.918 --> 05:34.875
One day Stein let Bishop know about his
new business plan, and offered him a job.

05:34.876 --> 05:40.166
What he said was, "I know Jack Tramiel,
who's the head of Commodore."

05:40.167 --> 05:45.958
He's giving me the first twenty or thirty
Commodore 64s from the production line,

05:45.959 --> 05:52.875
"and I'm going to set all of these rocket scientists
and math professors to work making computer games."

05:52.876 --> 06:01.082
The sales director of Commodore
was a good friend of mine,

06:01.083 --> 06:05.666
and we had a good relationship
when he became a sales director.

06:05.667 --> 06:11.333
I also had a good relationship with the
president, who survived Auschwitz;

06:11.334 --> 06:14.374
I've been to Hong Kong
with him a few times.

06:14.375 --> 06:20.666
So it was a good relationship. It looked like
they were going to have a great deal of success,

06:20.667 --> 06:27.666
and if they were going to a have a great deal of success,
we were going to have a great deal of success too.

06:27.667 --> 06:35.333
In December of 1982, I had a stroke of luck when
John Baxter, the sales director of Commodore UK,

06:35.334 --> 06:44.416
appeared with a Commodore 64 and a 1541 floppy
drive, followed by my friend Robert Stein.

06:44.417 --> 06:51.166
They told me, “Gábor, we'd like to
develop game software in Hungary.

06:51.167 --> 06:59.166
We can ensure our software
people won't get stolen from us,

06:59.167 --> 07:07.166
and because there's border control
between the two countries,

07:07.167 --> 07:14.583
software is hard to transfer
from one place to another,

07:14.584 --> 07:21.917
which assures our secrecy.

07:21.918 --> 07:30.876
Gábor, announce a competition,
to collect some ideas.”

07:31.918 --> 07:36.875
Ami, I have gained access to documents about the
beginning of video game development in Hungary.

07:36.876 --> 07:40.708
It turns out that even before the
open call for game concepts was announced,

07:40.709 --> 07:45.708
Budapest University of Technology freshmen Viktor
Tóth and Viktor Zámbó heard a rumor about it,

07:45.709 --> 07:47.583
and quickly got in touch with Novotrade.

07:47.584 --> 07:54.166
We showed up, and told them that we had heard that they
were doing game development, and asked can we join?

07:54.167 --> 07:59.625
They stared at us and asked what we were talking about,
saying that they didn't know about anything like that.

07:59.626 --> 08:06.082
Then they started running around in the office, because there
were these two youngsters, and no one knew what they wanted.

08:06.083 --> 08:10.875
“Oh right, we just got a package yesterday,
it's in the next room.”

08:10.876 --> 08:17.999
And there it was, a C64, unwrapped. “We didn't know what
to do with it, but if you're interested, take a look.”

08:18.000 --> 08:22.374
We jumped on it, got hooked,
even without any documentation.

08:22.375 --> 08:30.082
The interesting thing about that machine was that
it was the second C64 ever manufactured in the UK,

08:30.083 --> 08:34.208
so the serial number on it was 0000000002.

08:35.082 --> 08:40.416
Look at this, Ami! In the middle of January
1983, Novotrade turned to the Hungarian people,

08:40.417 --> 08:42.541
asking them to submit game concepts

08:42.542 --> 08:46.374
in a spot on the TV show
Ideas for National Business Innovation.

08:46.375 --> 08:54.041
The programme aired mid-January; By the end of January,
more than a thousand applications had arrived.

08:54.042 --> 09:00.958
We were reading storyboards day and night,
to figure out which ideas we wanted to use.

09:00.959 --> 09:05.666
Most ideas were simple games,
with varying degrees of detail.

09:05.667 --> 09:09.500
Some people drew things,
even sent in screen layouts,

09:09.501 --> 09:13.750
and pretty good storyboards of what they
imagined would make a good game.

09:13.751 --> 09:17.875
The computer games that existed
had never reached Hungary,

09:17.876 --> 09:23.917
so people were able to bring in fresh ideas
and new approaches to game design.

09:23.918 --> 09:28.124
Most of the ideas were
either bad or just mundane,

09:28.125 --> 09:31.249
but there were four or five nice ones.

09:31.250 --> 09:36.625
Based on the pictures, we picked the ones
we found worth translating,

09:36.626 --> 09:41.374
and sent them through to the UK in English.

09:41.375 --> 09:47.082
What reached Commodore was about one hundred
to one hundred and twenty storyboards.

09:47.083 --> 09:53.374
They picked about ten, and we
started developing them.

09:53.375 --> 09:59.292
And that's how Hungarian
game development started.

10:06.959 --> 10:12.374
Most people who applied were insisting that
they wanted to be involved in development,

10:12.375 --> 10:15.750
and they were the ones
bringing the programmers in.

10:15.751 --> 10:20.333
You had engineers and
telecommunications technicians

10:20.334 --> 10:23.583
who'd seen processors before
and knew what memory was.

10:23.584 --> 10:28.291
You also had programmer mathematicians from ELTE
university who'd seen huge operating systems,

10:28.292 --> 10:30.750
COBOL, and enormous
reel-to-reel tapes before...

10:30.751 --> 10:35.082
They had some pretty serious
people showing up at Novotrade;

10:35.083 --> 10:40.458
Once the competition started taking shape,
and projects had to get started,

10:40.459 --> 10:44.416
they began forming teams, and we
were paired up with some veterans.

10:44.417 --> 10:51.208
It was absolutely loose; We applied to Novotrade, they
accepted it, we signed a contract, they gave us a machine,

10:51.209 --> 10:55.875
and they told us that we should start working
and to let them know when we were done.

10:55.876 --> 10:58.124
Sure, they did check up on our progress.

10:58.125 --> 11:02.249
We never had an office
we had to go to work in.

11:02.250 --> 11:10.124
Novotrade mostly just provided a framework to young
enthusiastic people to be able to do things.

11:10.125 --> 11:14.833
Essentially everyone worked at home,
and Novotrade was more of a meeting point

11:14.834 --> 11:17.708
where you could come
and show what you did at home.

11:17.709 --> 11:22.958
Whenever we worked together, we agreed
on where to meet the day after tomorrow.

11:22.959 --> 11:27.416
We had no fixed location, we just
wandered around carrying the C64.

11:27.417 --> 11:33.166
Once the machine arrived, the Commodore,
I felt this machine would change my life;

11:33.167 --> 11:36.958
It just looked so perfect,
even the box was pristine.

11:36.959 --> 11:40.876
And I think this later
turned out to be true.

11:43.250 --> 11:49.875
Ah, it seems like the first five games made in Hungary were
published at Commodore and released as Commodore software.

11:49.876 --> 11:55.124
Hungarian games were also released by
Mirrorsoft, Quicksilva, Virgin, and Activision,

11:55.125 --> 11:57.166
among other large game publishers.

11:57.167 --> 12:01.416
A good number of these games already included
some amazing technical accomplishments.

12:01.417 --> 12:05.876
In Arctic Shipwreck, developers managed
to move a fullscreen 3D ice floe.

12:12.834 --> 12:16.458
Ami, I found an article about
two young English marketing guys

12:16.459 --> 12:19.541
founding a company
called Domark in 1984.

12:19.542 --> 12:23.583
They didn't have a clue about game
development, but they had a sensational idea.

12:23.584 --> 12:29.875
The first person to get through the game and find
a secret telephone number, which was embedded,

12:29.876 --> 12:33.666
and ring the number,
they'd win twenty-five thousand pounds.

12:33.667 --> 12:37.041
Twenty-five thousand pounds were
a lot of money in the UK at the time,

12:37.042 --> 12:40.041
especially for someone who has been
drinking at home unemployed for six months.

12:40.042 --> 12:46.625
We didn't know anybody who was making these games. It
was quite difficult, there wasn't really a community,

12:46.626 --> 12:52.583
there was no way that you could actively find
studios. They were all being put together,

12:52.584 --> 12:58.124
many of them, in the north of England,
in Manchester and Liverpool,

12:58.125 --> 13:02.166
and they were being put together
in small basement offices.

13:02.167 --> 13:04.751
It was all terribly...
It was a cottage industry.

13:05.918 --> 13:10.875
Wanting to produce Eureka in record-breaking
time for both Commodore 64 and Spectrum systems

13:10.876 --> 13:14.750
didn't make finding the right
development team any easier.

13:14.751 --> 13:18.208
Domark was quite fortunate that
David Bishop and Robert Stein came along,

13:18.209 --> 13:22.208
and with them the possibility of
developing the title in Hungary.

13:22.209 --> 13:29.416
Robi came up and told us that no one else wants to
touch this, so it might turn out to be something big,

13:29.417 --> 13:35.500
not just in England but in the games industry
in general, and said we should take the job.

13:35.501 --> 13:39.082
We just looked at each other,
and at Andris Császár;

13:39.083 --> 13:46.291
The game had to be delivered on two different types of
machines at the same time, with no bugs, and so on.

13:46.292 --> 13:53.833
So we told Robi that this is practically impossible,
of course no sane person would volunteer to do this.

13:53.834 --> 13:59.583
At the same time, it was attractive, it sounded
exciting, and we never even talked about the money.

13:59.584 --> 14:06.333
So we said, “Robi, tell them a large number,” and he gave them
a number with more zeroes in it than we'd ever seen before,

14:06.334 --> 14:08.833
thinking that they'd turn
us down immediately.

14:08.834 --> 14:12.417
The next day the phone rang and we had
been greenlit. We were ready to go.

14:14.792 --> 14:18.291
Ami, I found out about another
key figure involved with Eureka.

14:18.292 --> 14:22.583
Since it was a text adventure, the story and
puzzles were written by Ian Livingstone,

14:22.584 --> 14:25.833
author of the widely successful
Fighting Fantasy books.

14:25.834 --> 14:31.208
My primary role was come up with the
storyline (that you can travel through time,

14:31.209 --> 14:35.416
(and have an adventure through
time was the main premise)

14:35.417 --> 14:41.999
and how it all came together... how to
conceal the clues inside the art booklet,

14:42.000 --> 14:46.583
which I had commissioned from the artist
I'd been using at Games Workshop.

14:46.584 --> 14:54.750
Some of the clues were in the artwork, some were in the text in the
rulebook, and of course a lot of them were in the game itself,

14:54.751 --> 14:57.416
so it was quite a complicated process.

14:57.417 --> 15:01.374
It was a bigger task than I
thought it was going to be,

15:01.375 --> 15:05.833
because not having created a video game before,
I didn't really understand the limitations,

15:05.834 --> 15:10.208
I wanted to make it, you know, huge,
and we had to compromise quite a bit,

15:10.209 --> 15:12.458
but it was all part of
the learning experience.

15:12.459 --> 15:16.708
Ian Livingstone got so into it along the way that by
the fifth Caribbean level he stopped being realistic,

15:16.709 --> 15:20.917
and started to come up with things like “...and
then the player climbs on a hydroplane!”

15:20.918 --> 15:25.333
So we had to tell him “No, no, no, no
hydroplanes, that can't be implemented.

15:25.334 --> 15:29.249
Yes, they can pick up the shell
and throw it, but no hydroplane.”

15:29.250 --> 15:33.083
Then he started being overly detailed about it, and
we had to tell him “No, no, no, this won't work.”

15:33.751 --> 15:36.791
In order to produce the game
on time for both systems,

15:36.792 --> 15:40.791
the developers created a virtual machine
with a new programming language,

15:40.792 --> 15:43.041
which was a unique solution at the time.

15:43.042 --> 15:47.374
The code written in this enviroment was easy
to convert for Commodore and Spectrum systems,

15:47.375 --> 15:50.833
and was then fine-tuned for each
platform by a different team.

15:50.834 --> 15:55.082
Andris Császár and the Commodore team
were down in the city,

15:55.083 --> 15:58.291
and we were up on the hill in District II,

15:58.292 --> 16:02.041
and we sometimes took taxis back and forth.

16:02.042 --> 16:05.833
So a taxi would show up at
the Commodore team's place,

16:05.834 --> 16:10.291
or a graphics artist or programmer would take one to the
Spectrum team in the middle of the night, at 1:30AM,

16:10.292 --> 16:13.208
and they'd have a conversation like,

16:13.209 --> 16:19.249
“Hey, at the entrance to the Vestal Virgins, the guard's damage
should be lowered by two points, because it's too much.”

16:19.250 --> 16:24.500
And the taxi drivers, they'd seen many
things in the Budapest night life,

16:24.501 --> 16:30.708
but the address was not a psychiatric institution or a
night club... So we did get a few strange glances, going

16:30.709 --> 16:33.959
“Wha...? Huh? What's a Vestal Virgin?”

16:35.000 --> 16:38.708
Ami, I found a book which says
that Domark charged Novotrade

16:38.709 --> 16:41.917
660 pounds
for each day the project was late,

16:41.918 --> 16:45.291
which might have contributed to the
extremely fast pace of development.

16:45.292 --> 16:50.082
There'd be times we didn't go home for three
days, or our wives came in, showed us our kid,

16:50.083 --> 16:54.208
brought in some food, and left,
and we went back to the buglist.

16:54.209 --> 16:56.208
That's how it went towards the end.

16:56.209 --> 17:00.541
The last week was spent in
my father-in-law's apartment;

17:00.542 --> 17:05.458
We taped the buglist on the closet door, which
looked great in a household environment.

17:05.459 --> 17:11.500
That's where we threw the final master tape out the
window to David Bishop (who was waiting with a taxi)

17:11.501 --> 17:16.125
which he caught, thank God, and took off
barely in time to catch his plane to London.

17:25.375 --> 17:29.208
It was on Spectrum and Commodore,

17:29.209 --> 17:33.541
and I think we sold pretty
much fifty thousand of each,

17:33.542 --> 17:36.917
I'm going to say the total number was
about one hundred thousand copies.

17:36.918 --> 17:42.249
It went off with a huge bang. It basically laid
the groundwork for game development at Novotrade

17:42.250 --> 17:46.249
becoming its own branch, with its own team.

17:46.250 --> 17:50.917
We started to hire additional people,
the team grew quite big,

17:50.918 --> 17:54.292
and this brought in some great press.

17:56.334 --> 17:59.500
A computer game, developed
in secret behind the Iron Curtain,

17:59.501 --> 18:01.584
was presented to the public in London.

18:02.584 --> 18:05.125
The games world has never
seen anything like it.

18:06.209 --> 18:10.167
Initial demand for the game is claimed to
have beaten all home software records.

18:11.250 --> 18:15.626
Eureka has gone to the top of the software
charts after just three weeks on the market.

18:16.918 --> 18:23.209
Fifteen year old Matthew Woodley receives his 25,000
pound reward for successful completion of Eureka.

18:24.709 --> 18:28.834
More producers have turned to the men from
Budapest in their quest for software hits.

18:30.334 --> 18:32.584
Hungary leaps into high technology.

18:34.125 --> 18:38.250
Western computer stores are clearing room
on their shelves for Hungarian products.

18:40.042 --> 18:44.834
Novotrade expects to make 1,5 million
dollars from royalties in 1985.

18:45.959 --> 18:49.542
Games software outfit that
dodges the limelight and leads the world.

18:50.292 --> 18:58.333
The programming group was quite big, about
one hundred to one hundred fifty people.

18:58.334 --> 19:03.082
Somehow word started to spread
and people started to show up.

19:03.083 --> 19:09.249
Someone knew someone at the university,
overheard that someone else was working for us,

19:09.250 --> 19:13.833
and then friends brought more friends.

19:13.834 --> 19:17.374
We had forty projects running at one point,

19:17.375 --> 19:21.666
which means forty teams
with four to six people each;

19:21.667 --> 19:29.375
Ten to fifteen of these were original
games, the rest were ports or outsourcing.

19:31.792 --> 19:35.041
Ami, I discovered a document
called the CoCom list,

19:35.042 --> 19:42.333
which included all of the computers that Western bloc countries
would not sell to socialist countries or allow to be taken there.

19:42.334 --> 19:46.999
Even back then, game development needed
computers, so there was demand for them.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.917
I myself have smuggled a machine out of
the UK that was on the CoCom list,

19:52.918 --> 19:57.999
and I was in actual danger of
being arrested if I was spotted.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.458
The real scare came when I was standing at
Heathrow airport with my suitcase,

20:03.459 --> 20:06.791
and Robi Stein came up to me and said,

20:06.792 --> 20:11.500
“Until we arrive in Budapest,
we don't know each other, okay?”

20:11.501 --> 20:13.999
That's when I got nauseous.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.833
We didn't even consider what would've happened
if someone had asked some serious questions.

20:19.834 --> 20:27.416
And of course, Novotrade provided full support
for this, they were our accomplices in crime.

20:27.417 --> 20:32.875
I'm pretty sure we could've landed in the
crosshairs of the CIA because of this.

20:32.876 --> 20:39.041
Even things that were not on the
CoCom list were hard to bring in,

20:39.042 --> 20:42.500
the government only
supported Eastern imports.

20:42.501 --> 20:47.833
So whatever hardware arrived in Hungary
was brought via pocket import,

20:47.834 --> 20:52.124
smuggling; It just appeared out of nowhere.

20:52.125 --> 20:56.666
They were classified as sensitive to bright light, and
delivered at night. The customs guys just looked away.

20:56.667 --> 21:03.291
I got to know some great customs officers who were really
excited about Hungarian game development blossoming.

21:03.292 --> 21:09.541
So there were many moments
where we'd plug together a C64 and a TV

21:09.542 --> 21:13.584
in a customs office
and play some games with them.

21:14.584 --> 21:19.291
It wasn't only the experience of smuggling computers
into Hungary that resembled an adventure game.

21:19.292 --> 21:25.958
Getting gaming software out of the country to foreign distributors
was also an experience like something out of a spy movie.

21:25.959 --> 21:29.666
You couldn't just mail a
tape with the game on it,

21:29.667 --> 21:34.374
the bureau of secrecy had to come out and put
a stamp on it stating that it was secret.

21:34.375 --> 21:37.833
Of course they had no clue
what was on the tape,

21:37.834 --> 21:42.750
but they only allowed us to ship it
once the stamp was on the floppy.

21:42.751 --> 21:46.791
I used to get stopped sometimes trying
to leave Hungary with these cassettes,

21:46.792 --> 21:51.500
the border guards would put the cassettes in a
machine and it would go beep-beep-beep-beep,

21:51.501 --> 21:57.791
and they'd think I was some kind of spy trying
to take national secrets out of Hungary.

21:57.792 --> 22:02.918
It was quite funny, because they didn't... no one
really knew about computer games in those days.

22:04.167 --> 22:08.708
What I see here Ami, is that even when a
computer was released from the CoCom list,

22:08.709 --> 22:11.791
it didn't mean that it could be
sold in Hungary right away.

22:11.792 --> 22:19.541
I had to bribe the British Trade
delegation two or three times

22:19.542 --> 22:26.291
so that they would give us permission
to import C64s to Hungary.

22:26.292 --> 22:30.249
I was the only person who
got that permission,

22:30.250 --> 22:34.333
and I was the only person
who was shipping C64s.

22:34.334 --> 22:38.124
Even Novotrade didn't have
independent foreign trade rights.

22:38.125 --> 22:41.291
You couldn't just import things, you couldn't
just acquire computer hardware like that.

22:41.292 --> 22:49.333
You could only import a limited amount... one hundred,
two hundred, three hundred machines to Hungary;

22:49.334 --> 22:56.792
Gábor Rényi and Metrimpex would receive the
computers together and distribute them in Hungary.

23:10.375 --> 23:16.625
Compared to a C64, a smartphone's processor
is more than a thousand times faster.

23:16.626 --> 23:22.124
We shouldn't even mention memory capacity, because
that's above a hundred thousand times more.

23:22.125 --> 23:27.249
And that's the world in which
we had to create games

23:27.250 --> 23:30.500
that were both playable and spectacular.

23:30.501 --> 23:35.416
When we started working with a Commodore 64,
there wasn't really Commodore 64 software.

23:35.417 --> 23:37.416
It was all brand new.

23:37.417 --> 23:41.708
We had to figure out it all out ourselves,

23:41.709 --> 23:45.124
there was no one to turn to.

23:45.125 --> 23:48.791
You just had to understand what was happening,
and from that point on it was pure maths.

23:48.792 --> 23:52.791
On smaller machines, we would
remove the entire kernel

23:52.792 --> 23:57.166
and we'd control everything ourselves:
All the I/O ports, screen pixels...

23:57.167 --> 24:00.458
We'd be able to do things that the
machine itself was incapable of.

24:00.459 --> 24:08.082
We created a demo that showed it was possible to do
a fullscreen moving horizon on the Commodore 64.

24:08.083 --> 24:14.082
We would've really liked to do a flight
simulator, or a space simulator game.

24:14.083 --> 24:20.249
We really didn't know what was impossible,
because the Commodore engineers told us

24:20.250 --> 24:27.374
that the machine was not capable of doing it, and we
replied by sending them a demo showing them how to do it.

24:27.375 --> 24:33.291
If you're not afraid, you can often do
things that others consider impossible.

24:33.292 --> 24:39.541
So there were things we did because
we didn't know they were impossible.

24:39.542 --> 24:47.041
These guys, working in the games studio, were
geniuses, without exaggeration, without exception.

24:47.042 --> 24:52.041
Nothing was impossible to them.

24:52.042 --> 24:57.082
We wrote a ton of code, enormous amounts. And
it's one of those things where people kept saying

24:57.083 --> 25:02.249
that it's impossible to do this in six
months or a year, however much time we had,

25:02.250 --> 25:04.249
but we did it anyway.

25:04.250 --> 25:09.124
One day we met the board of Commodore,
including the legendary Jack Tramiel.

25:09.125 --> 25:13.958
One of the reasons he came to Budapest
was our moving-horizon demo.

25:13.959 --> 25:19.291
In the early phases, we did things where the
program would modify itself during the game.

25:19.292 --> 25:21.999
Not the data, the code itself.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.999
It simply didn't fit into the 64k of the Commodore,
and there was no other way to implement the game.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.166
Once a level was done, it was no
longer needed, so we modified it.

25:31.167 --> 25:36.416
It was absurd, it wasn't supposed to
be done, but we had to, so we did.

25:36.417 --> 25:41.625
It was like the Wild West, we were breaking new
ground, we were making the rules up as we went along.

25:41.626 --> 25:45.124
It was a time in our lives where
we weren't afraid of anything.

25:45.125 --> 25:50.374
It's a fantastic experience when you consider
something impossible, but decide to do it anyway.

25:50.375 --> 25:53.333
You can't do it, but you
will do it... but how?

25:53.334 --> 25:56.500
We didn't know what we didn't know,
so we started on things

25:56.501 --> 25:59.667
that we never would've done if we
would've known more about them.

26:06.292 --> 26:13.458
We rented apartments for these development
teams, who moved in, lived there, worked there.

26:13.459 --> 26:18.833
They practically didn't see
other human beings.

26:18.834 --> 26:24.333
An average day looked interesting:
You'd wake up early, meaning 11-12 AM,

26:24.334 --> 26:30.708
some breakfast, quick shower, and then
you'd sit down in front of the computer

26:30.709 --> 26:36.082
thinking “I'm just gonna
check this real quick”.

26:36.083 --> 26:41.500
Then suddenly it's 10-11PM and you
still didn't check what “this” was,

26:41.501 --> 26:47.124
but you were too hungry, so you'd go
have dinner around midnight.

26:47.125 --> 26:51.708
We'd work, and at 4AM the
local baker would open with us.

26:51.709 --> 26:55.917
He'd hand us the first run
with the baking shovel;

26:55.918 --> 27:01.041
It was free but it was so hot we had
to juggle it all the way home.

27:01.042 --> 27:06.625
I had a developer who had a tight deadline,
so he lived in his office.

27:06.626 --> 27:11.917
He slept there, ate there, bathed there,
brushed his teeth there,

27:11.918 --> 27:17.374
everything for three months.
He went out for drinks maybe twice.

27:17.375 --> 27:24.416
Everyone involved was
putting their hearts into this.

27:24.417 --> 27:31.291
This meant abandoning your private life,
sometimes not showering for a week...

27:31.292 --> 27:37.500
It was almost like punk bands in garages.

27:37.501 --> 27:43.708
We mostly slept next to the computers. There were
periods where we'd sleep while the programs compiled.

27:43.709 --> 27:52.917
Our ears got tuned to when the builds ended; The
drive made this little noise as the head moved.

27:52.918 --> 27:58.708
We'd wake up to that, knowing
there was stuff to do again.

27:58.709 --> 28:03.999
We'd play a lot too. Occasionally
there would be a few good games

28:04.000 --> 28:09.541
that were detrimental to development. Street
Fighter II was the best of the best, really.

28:09.542 --> 28:13.458
We couldn't stop until everyone
had gotten really good at it.

28:13.459 --> 28:16.541
We had no phones, so once my girlfriend
showed up after a few days

28:16.542 --> 28:18.833
wondering where I was.

28:18.834 --> 28:26.042
Generally, you needed either a fantastic girlfriend
or wife, or to be single... no relationship at all.

28:32.417 --> 28:37.583
Our initial motivation was to make the greatest
game ever, one everyone will be talking about.

28:37.584 --> 28:44.041
The opportunity to score a ton of money was
in front of us. You saw all the Porsches,

28:44.042 --> 28:51.166
you read the articles about world markets, but
no-one really thought it was possible in Hungary.

28:51.167 --> 28:56.917
Still, it was great to be a part of
something that was internationally cool.

28:56.918 --> 29:01.958
Very few of us did it for the money. I can't
really think of anyone in my immediate peer group

29:01.959 --> 29:06.208
who did it because they
thought it'd be really lucrative.

29:06.209 --> 29:13.249
We had this feeling that we were making unlimited progress,
moving forward year by year, and it would never end.

29:13.250 --> 29:18.791
That world was ours. Of course, this was
quite contrary to our environment.

29:18.792 --> 29:24.374
To be able to develop the same games we
were playing and buying... well, stealing,

29:24.375 --> 29:28.124
that was the only option at the time...

29:28.125 --> 29:33.333
Or just to be in industry in socialist
Hungary, it was a huge motivation for us.

29:33.334 --> 29:38.625
It was always a triumph to do something
that surprised the Westerners.

29:38.626 --> 29:43.458
Everyone was attracted by the idea
of trying to do something

29:43.459 --> 29:47.082
that was pushing their own limits.

29:47.083 --> 29:52.416
It's just me, the task, and the machine. If
something doesn't work, I can only blame myself,

29:52.417 --> 29:56.249
I can only berate myself.
And if I manage to do it,

29:56.250 --> 30:02.750
then everyone else can only attempt to
reproduce it. It's a great feeling,

30:02.751 --> 30:05.958
it's like winning the Olympics.

30:05.959 --> 30:10.541
We didn't want to change the world,
we just wanted to be a useful part of it.

30:10.542 --> 30:13.918
To be adequate, to be better,
to push it further.

30:15.501 --> 30:18.374
Ami, I have the developers'
financial statements.

30:18.375 --> 30:22.583
Based on these, it looks like payouts
were random both in frequency and amount.

30:22.584 --> 30:28.374
Sometimes they were paid a fixed sum every month,
but in other cases they only received royalties.

30:28.375 --> 30:34.124
This sometimes meant they earned next to nothing and sometimes
meant their profits reached record-crunching levels.

30:34.125 --> 30:40.374
One thing is very interesting for sure. Profits from games
sold in the West were paid to developers in U.S. dollars,

30:40.375 --> 30:43.249
which earned them serious
privileges at that time.

30:43.250 --> 30:49.791
You couldn't buy dollars here. Instead,
when you earned dollars with your work,

30:49.792 --> 30:54.625
you didn't have to
exchange them for forints.

30:54.626 --> 31:00.999
When you were earning foreign currencies, it
opened doors for you, like foreign currency stores

31:01.000 --> 31:06.291
where only the party and state leaders,
and employees of embassies

31:06.292 --> 31:11.750
(who also received their salaries
in foreign currency), could go in.

31:11.751 --> 31:15.666
They were also called “diplomat shops”.

31:15.667 --> 31:24.541
When you entered one of these dollar shops, it
felt as if you had finally arrived in the West.

31:24.542 --> 31:28.625
You could buy drinks, televisions,

31:28.626 --> 31:33.666
everything the average
Hungarian couldn't get.

31:33.667 --> 31:38.999
There was a seven-to-eight year waiting list
for a car, which is inconceivable today.

31:39.000 --> 31:44.500
In the dollar shop it was three months
if you paid in foreign currency, and so on.

31:44.501 --> 31:49.375
By the end of the eighties, I had bought
a Ford Mustang with the money I earned.

31:52.209 --> 31:55.876
Mission Accomplished

32:07.083 --> 32:12.625
Ami, I'm in an ancient labyrinth, on a quest
to explore 'the golden age' of Novotrade.

32:12.626 --> 32:18.917
Between 1985 and 1988, several successful titles
made it out of Hungarian developers' hands.

32:18.918 --> 32:23.458
These included the official Tour De France game,
where you had to move the joystick like a madman

32:23.459 --> 32:26.666
to move and control the
virtual bike at the same time,

32:26.667 --> 32:31.082
and Alternative World Games, where users could
compete in events like garbage bag sack races,

32:31.083 --> 32:34.541
running while carrying dishes,
and sprinting up a wall.

32:34.542 --> 32:39.082
The biggest success was a first-person
3D labyrinth game named Scarabaeus.

32:39.083 --> 32:43.791
Csaba Nagy was the one who created the
3D labyrinth in Scarabeus.

32:43.792 --> 32:47.583
Everyone said it was impossible
on the Commodore 64.

32:47.584 --> 32:52.958
Labyrinths are a basic game design element,
you want to make a maze.

32:52.959 --> 33:00.875
But then you start thinking, “okay, but let's not do Pac-Man,
'cos that's also a maze, instead let's be *in* the maze”.

33:00.876 --> 33:07.291
One night he dreamt up a way of doing it,
the next day he did it,

33:07.292 --> 33:11.583
and we wrote a game around it.

33:11.584 --> 33:20.166
I don't know if anyone ever made a
three-dimensional maze before us.

33:20.167 --> 33:27.751
What really affected people was
the audio we put into the game.

33:35.292 --> 33:39.791
The most realistic and gripping
atmosphere I've ever encountered.

33:39.792 --> 33:44.791
The best and most apt sound
effects ever programmed on the C64.

33:44.792 --> 33:48.541
This is the best arcade
adventure of the year.

33:48.542 --> 33:52.584
I have never played anything
quite like Scarabaeus before.

33:53.000 --> 33:58.082
I've stumbled upon a blog entry from the past
millennium describing another Hungarian success.

33:58.083 --> 34:02.541
The second episode of the Impossible Mission
series, released by the American publisher Epyx,

34:02.542 --> 34:04.750
was also produced by Novotrade.

34:04.751 --> 34:08.123
The first episode was hailed as game
of the year by several magazines,

34:08.125 --> 34:13.123
so the Americans clearly trusted the Hungarian
developers if they asked them to produce the sequel.

34:13.125 --> 34:17.875
They sent us a QA guy from America,

34:17.876 --> 34:23.248
I remember because he had a really
funny name: Alan Dangerfield.

34:23.250 --> 34:28.333
He just sat there and played, it was
incredible, playing all the time.

34:28.333 --> 34:33.791
I think there'll be more and
more games made in Hungary.

34:33.792 --> 34:39.248
This game has a high level of quality.
The programmers are very professional.

34:39.250 --> 34:43.792
They've been a joy to work with from day
one, everything is going really smoothly.

34:44.876 --> 34:49.750
Impossible Mission 2 – The second
greatest game of all time?

34:49.751 --> 34:53.333
I've played it more than
I've played anything else in years.

34:53.333 --> 34:57.917
More of a challenge than a platform
game has ever given you before.

34:57.918 --> 35:03.000
More superb a sequel than
anyone could have hoped for.

35:04.667 --> 35:10.500
Ami, it seems to me that in the eighties, there were seven
to eight different computers in retail circulation.

35:10.501 --> 35:14.583
No wonder Novotrade won numerous contracts
to port games to different systems.

35:14.584 --> 35:21.958
It sounds easy to port a game from one platform to another.
One of the platforms at the time was coin-op arcades.

35:21.959 --> 35:28.917
So what happened is that a truck would arrive, and they'd
bring in this arcade cabinet that was set to free play.

35:28.918 --> 35:36.833
We'd pay two kids who'd play Star Wars for 5 lives
or so, and they'd show us what was going on there.

35:36.834 --> 35:40.416
We were developing, so we had
no time to analyze games.

35:40.417 --> 35:47.041
So every now and then a van would show up... people
probably thought we're running a casino or an arcade...

35:47.042 --> 35:50.792
And they'd bring in machines,
like Indiana Jones.

35:52.626 --> 35:57.625
Thanks to Robert Stein, Hungarians were among
the first to start developing for the Atari ST.

35:57.626 --> 36:04.791
UK-based SYSTEM 3 hired Novotrade to port one of their most
successful games, International Karate, for this new platform.

36:04.792 --> 36:10.333
The Atari version of the title was so amazing that
later Atari used the game in their advertising.

36:10.334 --> 36:16.833
For whatever reason, Robert managed
to get Atari ST hardware into Hungary,

36:16.834 --> 36:23.583
and it was probably one of the first development teams that
we felt comfortable with that could do Atari ST development.

36:23.584 --> 36:28.666
They've made I think the best version,
which was International Karate, on the ST.

36:28.667 --> 36:33.374
We'd look at the original game,
and we'd try to copy it.

36:33.375 --> 36:38.999
I guess musicians at the time
would start their careers like that,

36:39.000 --> 36:43.374
looking at the original,
but trying to do better.

36:43.375 --> 36:48.791
It was a fantastic bit of work. The art
was really really beautiful.

36:48.792 --> 36:53.334
All of the art was done in Hungary, and
all of the coding was done in Hungary.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.876
Mission Accomplished

37:07.542 --> 37:15.500
The most well known and most famous game of the
Commodore 64 era in Europe was Last Ninja,

37:15.501 --> 37:19.082
one that also spawned sequels.

37:19.083 --> 37:24.666
According to Mark Cale, head of System 3,
who also designed the original game,

37:24.667 --> 37:27.999
this was the biggest bestseller of the era,

37:28.000 --> 37:34.416
reaching up to several million units
sold across all platforms.

37:34.417 --> 37:40.041
We're talking about an action-adventure,
which was not a new genre,

37:40.042 --> 37:44.791
it had been around a few years
at the time already.

37:44.792 --> 37:50.875
What made this game special was
the amazing audiovisual presentation,

37:50.876 --> 37:57.166
exploiting the Commodore 64's sound and
video capabilities to the absolute fullest.

37:57.167 --> 38:08.791
With my detective dog Lola, I found out that the game's
quality was largely due to Hungarian developers:

38:08.792 --> 38:15.708
There was a team here called Softview,
part of Novotrade.

38:15.709 --> 38:24.917
The Brits hired Softview to develop the game, and they
kept sending parts, getting feedback on the game.

38:24.918 --> 38:36.458
The graphics and audio were made by Brits,
but the fundamentals were built by Softview.

38:36.459 --> 38:43.958
The story had a sad ending when System 3 took
development away from the Hungarian team

38:43.959 --> 38:48.042
and finished the game themselves.

38:50.709 --> 38:57.708
At that time what was very unique is that
there was a group of programmers in Hungary.

38:57.709 --> 39:03.666
Generally the developers in the UK
were individual programmers

39:03.667 --> 39:07.124
working from their bedrooms
programming games,

39:07.125 --> 39:10.958
so it wasn't a professional
setup with studios,

39:10.959 --> 39:15.750
and this was the first time that we
met with some development teams.

39:15.751 --> 39:21.918
And the two games we started off with
were Bangkok Knights and Last Ninja.

39:22.876 --> 39:26.875
Novotrade contracted the Softview
studio led by Ferenc Ruzsa.

39:26.876 --> 39:29.041
Ruzsa had already made
games for Novotrade.

39:29.042 --> 39:34.958
He was one of the first to develop a real 3D title
for Commodore 64; It was a kayak simulator.

39:34.959 --> 39:40.541
But he didn't have a clue about the Japanese things
that had made their way into Western popular culture.

39:40.542 --> 39:44.249
No one had even heard of
the word “ninja” before,

39:44.250 --> 39:48.166
at best, we thought this was some
Japanese thing like judo.

39:48.167 --> 39:53.875
That's as much as the average person knew about it, and
we weren't even average people, just mathematicians.

39:53.876 --> 39:58.917
That's when I learned the word “nunchaku”.
And that other throwing thing,

39:58.918 --> 40:04.208
which I forget what it's called.
We kept looking at how it flies.

40:04.209 --> 40:09.917
So we watched a ton of films. From that we
figured out that we really liked the style,

40:09.918 --> 40:14.833
but we weren't sure how much of that
could translate to the computer.

40:14.834 --> 40:19.917
However, we realized what was
special about it, and what tools we could

40:19.918 --> 40:24.166
provide to youngsters in the West
who actually knew what a ninja was...

40:24.167 --> 40:29.458
Like the little thing he throws on the ground and
disappears in a puff of smoke, these kind of things.

40:29.459 --> 40:33.625
We sat down, listed all the ideas,
wrote them down on paper,

40:33.626 --> 40:38.000
and that's where the project started.
This was July of '86.

40:39.292 --> 40:43.666
Ami, I see that the deadline, as on
most game development projects, was tight.

40:43.667 --> 40:48.166
They wanted the title to be ready for the
holiday season on several platforms at once.

40:48.167 --> 40:54.458
This was the first time we had to work
on multiple platforms at once,

40:54.459 --> 41:01.374
and we realized you can't just use
machine code all the way for this.

41:01.375 --> 41:07.458
We created our own programming language,
which we used for development later.

41:07.459 --> 41:13.833
Machine code wasn't viable, because
every machine had its own logic;

41:13.834 --> 41:17.541
None of them had the same processor.

41:17.542 --> 41:24.208
We needed a higher-level language that
made more convenient programming possible,

41:24.209 --> 41:31.166
but a language that was close enough to
machine code that most routines we'd write

41:31.167 --> 41:36.541
would work on these platforms
with barely any loss of efficiency.

41:36.542 --> 41:41.708
So we took a language
called Forth as a template,

41:41.709 --> 41:48.041
read a book to understand roughly how it worked,
and created a similar language on our own.

41:48.042 --> 41:52.249
It was like the beginning of trying
to create a really interesting pipeline.

41:52.250 --> 41:57.459
That was a kind of development philosophy
that would end up being the future.

42:03.584 --> 42:08.249
They worked out a system which was revolutionary,
which was to try and build blocks,

42:08.250 --> 42:12.541
high-res blocks, together to
try and make high-res screens.

42:12.542 --> 42:19.291
So at that stage what we were able to try
to do was make groundbreaking graphics

42:19.292 --> 42:23.500
with this new concept of
building high-resolution blocks,

42:23.501 --> 42:26.166
and the Integrator was born.

42:26.167 --> 42:31.374
The hardest part was the routine
for rendering the backgrounds,

42:31.375 --> 42:34.750
which we called the Integrator.

42:34.751 --> 42:41.082
We could only afford one loading
sequence per level in the game,

42:41.083 --> 42:46.958
so at the start of every level we
loaded every image to memory.

42:46.959 --> 42:52.875
In order to make the
graphics more varied,

42:52.876 --> 42:59.999
we drew little pieces of graphics
and reused them in various ways.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.166
We had a wide variety of combinations.

43:04.167 --> 43:08.583
We were able to put them next to
each other so both of them disappeared,

43:08.584 --> 43:13.333
or one was on top of the other,
or one was transparent.

43:13.334 --> 43:20.292
That way you could take a bundle of bamboo and a bunch
of broken branches, and create a whole forest out of it.

43:24.584 --> 43:30.541
This is how the Integrator looked in operation. This was
essentially the basic set of visuals of the dungeon level.

43:30.542 --> 43:34.333
And this is where you
could pick the basic tiles.

43:34.334 --> 43:39.833
You had very few tiles, but these few tiles
could be combined in any number of ways.

43:39.834 --> 43:46.583
This gave us a variety and versatility
that we wanted to have in this game.

43:46.584 --> 43:51.958
The special thing about this level was
that we wanted to show actual torture,

43:51.959 --> 43:58.041
to have fire in the cauldron and for
the executioner to dunk the prisoner in.

43:58.042 --> 44:01.125
The memory limit didn't
make it possible though.

44:03.209 --> 44:07.166
The tiles we selected we can use
to add in a background here.

44:07.167 --> 44:13.666
You can position them by putting them
next to each other. Here, there, repeat.

44:13.667 --> 44:21.667
If you put them next to each other, or on top of each
other, you can pretty much create any shape for a level.

44:25.918 --> 44:30.124
There wasn't too much there when we were...
When we started in Hungary

44:30.125 --> 44:34.583
other than a great name
and ambitious concept.

44:34.584 --> 44:42.917
Why it's called Last Ninja, what his
mission was, who the final enemy was...

44:42.918 --> 44:47.875
These were all given to us from the start.

44:47.876 --> 44:53.999
Most developers liked playing,
they were avid gamers.

44:54.000 --> 45:00.666
So we could figure out
what was good in a game,

45:00.667 --> 45:06.708
we had a feel for it,
we had a ton of ideas.

45:06.709 --> 45:13.666
We hated it when a client specified too
precisely what they wanted in a game,

45:13.667 --> 45:17.500
and I have no such memory in this case.

45:17.501 --> 45:21.124
The whole team worked together
to design the game.

45:21.125 --> 45:26.541
It wasn't typical brainstorming,
we didn't sit down to come up with ideas,

45:26.542 --> 45:31.333
instead everyone was working,
and once something was visible,

45:31.334 --> 45:34.833
everyone took a look and
no one had to stay silent.

45:34.834 --> 45:40.041
They just looked at it, and something came
to their minds about what was possible.

45:40.042 --> 45:46.249
"Sometimes someone would say something
stupid, like “What if a dragon flew in?"

45:46.250 --> 45:52.166
and someone else would say
“Okay we can't have a dragon flying in,

45:52.167 --> 45:59.417
but the dragon is good, we can do something
with that, it's still technically possible.”

46:05.542 --> 46:09.750
We had certain fundamentals done.
We needed a lot more things,

46:09.751 --> 46:13.708
but we had a good idea of the ending,
of where we wanted to go with it.

46:13.709 --> 46:18.708
We only had some of the levels done,
but those were fully done.

46:18.709 --> 46:26.625
This also means 95% of the engine had to be finished,
because otherwise it wouldn't have worked.

46:26.626 --> 46:34.917
I have a feeling the first level was fully
done, about two to three were in progress,

46:34.918 --> 46:40.124
and we never started the ending.

46:40.125 --> 46:46.124
Our progress was mostly
fragments of a game.

46:46.125 --> 46:51.041
You were able to imagine how
the game would come together,

46:51.042 --> 46:55.792
but you couldn't imagine
when it would come together.

46:57.834 --> 47:02.166
The development phase chewed up a lot of time
with creating the unique programming language,

47:02.167 --> 47:03.666
as well as the Integrator.

47:03.667 --> 47:07.791
They were also developing Bangkok Knights,
so they really started to run out of time.

47:07.792 --> 47:12.917
The first deadline passed, then the second,
then the third, and we kept saying “next week!”

47:12.918 --> 47:14.833
So it started to look bad.

47:14.834 --> 47:17.666
Our objective was to ship
on multiple platforms,

47:17.667 --> 47:22.041
and while it's possible that
we had the most progress on Commodore,

47:22.042 --> 47:28.416
I-don't-know-how-many percent completion,
that's not how we looked at the project.

47:28.417 --> 47:33.625
We didn't write our own
programming language for fun.

47:33.626 --> 47:40.041
If we only would've wanted to ship on Commodore,
we would've just written it in machine code.

47:40.042 --> 47:43.958
I don't remember any major problems,

47:43.959 --> 47:49.291
nothing that would make us go
“oh no, the world's ending”.

47:49.292 --> 47:53.458
We were overqualified;

47:53.459 --> 47:59.875
Most of my colleagues had
degrees in mathematics research.

47:59.876 --> 48:06.875
We didn't meet the Christmas deadline,
we missed all the other deadlines,

48:06.876 --> 48:11.917
so around the end of February '87

48:11.918 --> 48:16.249
the Brits opted out of
any further cooperation.

48:16.250 --> 48:21.416
They didn't understand playability, and to try
and translate how something should play...

48:21.417 --> 48:24.750
It was quite often lost in translation.

48:24.751 --> 48:31.458
So both of those projects
we moved on from,

48:31.459 --> 48:35.541
and Robert and I had at this stage
formed a very strong relationship

48:35.542 --> 48:38.833
and he was very good to us,
he returned all of our money,

48:38.834 --> 48:43.958
we brought in John Twiddy to finish the
project, Robert and I found John Twiddy,

48:43.959 --> 48:46.750
and he finished the project.

48:46.751 --> 48:50.625
There was no coding that was
actually done by the Hungarian team.

48:50.626 --> 48:54.416
They were technically very very good,

48:54.417 --> 48:59.041
and for sure, without coming up
with the theory of the Integrator,

48:59.042 --> 49:01.917
the Last Ninja could
not have happened,

49:01.918 --> 49:07.583
because once we had the toolset
which was built in Hungary,

49:07.584 --> 49:12.583
to base how we would create the graphics with
Hugh Reilly, that game would never have happened,

49:12.584 --> 49:17.082
so you know, without the help of Robert
and his team, that wouldn't have happened.

49:17.083 --> 49:23.999
It's hard to say how much the concept period with
the Hungarian team had an effect on the project,

49:24.000 --> 49:28.375
but I'm sure it changed the soul
of the game, in a good way.

49:45.876 --> 49:51.541
In the UK, we had no competition,
we ruled the market.

49:51.542 --> 49:57.500
We were just waiting for the
Hungarians to produce software.

49:57.501 --> 50:00.249
It was a rush, it was like
a gold rush for product.

50:00.250 --> 50:02.917
I had no problems selling it.

50:02.918 --> 50:07.750
Not because I was so skilled, but because
I was the only one selling software.

50:07.751 --> 50:11.208
We were big because
the others weren't big.

50:11.209 --> 50:14.917
We showed up in America,
and went to play with the big boys.

50:14.918 --> 50:17.583
We went up to Epyx, Activision,
all of them, saying

50:17.584 --> 50:19.416
“Hello, we're here too,
Andromeda Software!”

50:19.417 --> 50:25.458
I never felt cowardly or shy, so I just
walked up to an American company and said

50:25.459 --> 50:30.501
“Hey, we have software, interested?”
“Sure, let's see.”

50:31.834 --> 50:34.374
I suppose Stein wasn't
shy in Japan neither.

50:34.375 --> 50:38.833
They went to the publishing houses
and showed them how good their games were.

50:38.834 --> 50:44.917
So we showed them a game and how cool it
was, and another game and how cool that was,

50:44.918 --> 50:49.541
a cowboy chasing buffalo,
a 3D maze, all that.

50:49.542 --> 50:54.500
Everything was super shiny, we thought
they'd go nuts over it.

50:54.501 --> 50:59.166
They just went
“Okay, anything for Nintendo?”

50:59.167 --> 51:04.958
So we said “No Nintendo, but…” And they said
“Okay, come back if you have Nintendo.”

51:04.959 --> 51:13.291
We had this happen four to five times, after which we
thought “Damn it, why don't we have Nintendo games?”

51:13.292 --> 51:19.833
So we tried to negotiate with Nintendo, but they told us
that that's not how it works, they're not an open system.

51:19.834 --> 51:26.166
Instead, Nintendo picks four, five, or six
partners out of several candidates,

51:26.167 --> 51:32.666
they get dedicated development kits, and
everyone else can go to hell, in business terms.

51:32.667 --> 51:37.791
So I told Robi, “Hey, let's go to the bazaar”...
they have a huge electronics bazaar in Akihabara...

51:37.792 --> 51:41.875
“I'm gonna point at a few things,
buy those for me.”

51:41.876 --> 51:48.374
So we went there, and I said “Two of those,
two of those” and brought them home.

51:48.375 --> 51:53.999
Nintendo wasn't showing any intention
of letting us into their world,

51:54.000 --> 52:01.583
because it was a walled garden with a ton of units
selling, and they were afraid for their market,

52:01.584 --> 52:08.541
so I said “Okay, if they really want
Nintendo, we'll give them Nintendo.”

52:08.542 --> 52:14.917
So I went to the mechanical measuring
instrument factory, to the telemechanics unit,

52:14.918 --> 52:21.208
where I knew the service engineer well
because I taught him English, and told him

52:21.209 --> 52:27.333
“Laci, I brought something, I have no idea what it
is, the chips don't even have numbers on them.”

52:27.334 --> 52:31.041
Obviously they made sure
we couldn't see anything.

52:31.042 --> 52:36.500
“We need this to be reverse-engineered, we
need a development environment.” He said okay.

52:36.501 --> 52:41.249
László Kalmár was the hardware person on
this project, he took this game cartridge

52:41.250 --> 52:46.041
...it wasn't even on tape... and
started analyzing the electronics.

52:46.042 --> 52:50.333
He found out that non-standard
methods had been used to make it,

52:50.334 --> 52:53.541
and he figured out
what these unique tricks were.

52:53.542 --> 52:58.124
He was able to dump the game's byte
data and code from the cartridge.

52:58.125 --> 53:02.208
That's when we, the software guys,
came in to take a look.

53:02.209 --> 53:07.416
They got to the point where they figured out which
one was the audio chip, which is where I came in.

53:07.417 --> 53:11.750
We tried to work it all out, watching
square waves with an oscilloscope.

53:11.751 --> 53:16.999
The audio chip was of course only part of
it, we were looking at the whole thing,

53:17.000 --> 53:21.374
the processor, the RAM,
how to load it from the outside.

53:21.375 --> 53:27.458
And in the end, after a few long months,
we had a development environment.

53:27.459 --> 53:31.833
It was very a Hungarian development environment,
with wires and soldering and duct tape...

53:31.834 --> 53:37.708
So then we went back to negotiate with Sony about
Traffic and a bunch of other potential games,

53:37.709 --> 53:41.041
and we showed them what we had.

53:41.042 --> 53:46.416
They said again “Aha, aha, do you have anything
for Nintendo?” “We do! Do you have a machine?”

53:46.417 --> 53:52.166
Japanese guys have training in displaying this emotionless
expression, so their reaction was a sight to behold.

53:52.167 --> 53:54.291
I'm serious, this made
the whole thing worth it.

53:54.292 --> 53:58.625
There were no legal barriers, Nintendo didn't
have a say in this as far as I can tell.

53:58.626 --> 54:03.500
They had obviously lost control over the
situation when a third-party developer appeared.

54:03.501 --> 54:09.291
News started spreading in Europe that the Hungarians could
make Nintendo games too. “How the hell did they do that?”

54:09.292 --> 54:12.750
When we sent the first demo to Konami,
they couldn't understand it either.

54:12.751 --> 54:15.917
“How did you do that, you're not
licensed developers!” Nope, we weren't!

54:15.918 --> 54:21.250
Novotrade gained a unique position with this, that's
where their console career started, as far as I know.

54:22.959 --> 54:24.875
Ami, I'm on my way to the garage,

54:24.876 --> 54:30.708
and it's starting to make sense why it was Hungary where all
these fantastic developments came to life in the eighties.

54:30.709 --> 54:34.666
Turns out that the Iron Curtain
had some positive side effects.

54:34.667 --> 54:38.416
And Soviet pressure started
to ease off at just about the right time.

54:38.417 --> 54:46.374
Compared to neighbouring countries, even within the
socialist system, we were a lot more flexible.

54:46.375 --> 54:51.082
We were “the happiest barrack”.
You could travel abroad,

54:51.083 --> 54:57.999
bring home disassembled Commodore 64s in your bag
or your pocket, and reassemble them at home.

54:58.000 --> 55:03.583
You could access a bunch of things
even Soviets weren't able to get.

55:03.584 --> 55:08.708
In Moscow, only Ligachyov's
grandson had a Commodore 64.

55:08.709 --> 55:13.541
Captain Gujdi, a customs officer, was
dying to see what we could do

55:13.542 --> 55:21.166
on a computer that was on the CoCom list,
and how the games would be published.

55:21.167 --> 55:26.458
He would give us tips on how to
take them abroad and what to do.

55:26.459 --> 55:30.333
The whole country was
full of Captain Gujdis.

55:30.334 --> 55:34.208
A lot of this was because of our isolation,

55:34.209 --> 55:38.625
how we were an exception
within the socialist system;

55:38.626 --> 55:45.082
We were allowed things, and we felt like we
could do something more, we could break out.

55:45.083 --> 55:50.500
We didn't care about the walls around us,
we were part of the outside world.

55:50.501 --> 55:53.374
We were more motivated.

55:53.375 --> 55:59.249
Kids in Western Europe were also motivated,
but they weren't as hungry as us.

55:59.250 --> 56:04.374
We were a lot hungrier,
and it's also true today.

56:04.375 --> 56:10.208
We come from a hungrier country, we're a lot
farther from the Western standard of living.

56:10.209 --> 56:16.958
They had to do less to maintain that lifestyle, whereas
we tried to reach it from an impossible distance.

56:16.959 --> 56:23.124
We were a lot more interested. Maybe it's
exactly because it wasn't a common thing,

56:23.125 --> 56:28.958
to just go to a store and buy it.
This made it a lot more interesting.

56:28.959 --> 56:39.124
You could feel there was a repressed creative
power in people, a need to communicate.

56:39.125 --> 56:46.124
It's the limits that make the masters distinguish
themselves. We had all these limits,

56:46.125 --> 56:53.417
we couldn't travel, so yes, I would say there
was an elemental desire for something new.

56:53.834 --> 56:59.082
Ami, I'm heading to a buffalo farm in the countryside
with the Ford Mustang I found in the garage.

56:59.083 --> 57:02.458
That's where Laszlo Mero, one of
the creators of Buffalo Roundup,

57:02.459 --> 57:07.375
will let me in on some new intel about
what was behind these Hungarian successes.

57:12.584 --> 57:18.875
In 1991, Playboy... a respectable publication, not just
because of the respectable ladies, but also the writing...

57:18.876 --> 57:24.208
Asked Garry Kasparov why the Soviet Union
had so many chess grandmasters.

57:24.209 --> 57:27.833
He answered, “What else is here to do?”

57:27.834 --> 57:34.166
...and I think that's why Hungary had so many good
game developers before the end of the communist era...

57:34.167 --> 57:36.791
Because what else was there to do?

57:36.792 --> 57:40.917
There were serious minds working on this.

57:40.918 --> 57:46.999
In America, it wasn't the best mathematicians
and programmers who liked programming,

57:47.000 --> 57:51.917
but kids in flannel shirts, and only those
who had a sensibility for it.

57:51.918 --> 57:58.416
In America, if you want an award-winning
mathematician to work on your game,

57:58.417 --> 58:05.666
you'll never get them because you can't afford
them and they have better things to do.

58:05.667 --> 58:09.166
In Hungary, you can still make it work.

58:09.167 --> 58:14.041
We were in a special situation
because we had engineers with degrees,

58:14.042 --> 58:19.999
people with tenure doing these things, which is
what we used to fill in for whatever was missing.

58:20.000 --> 58:23.875
Everyone was going nuts, they had so
many degrees and differential equations.

58:23.876 --> 58:29.791
When this all started, you didn't need a huge
investment. We smuggled in the Commodore 64,

58:29.792 --> 58:35.082
we worked on it, it was the perfect
thing to start capitalism with.

58:35.083 --> 58:38.708
Gábor Rényi saw the market gap perfectly,

58:38.709 --> 58:45.666
that he was able to export intellectual capital
from Hungary that was competitive in the West.

58:45.667 --> 58:50.500
When we got the first C64,
Gábor Rényi came in

58:50.501 --> 59:00.041
...he always had great quotes... and said that by the
year 2000, Hollywood is going to move into computers.

59:00.042 --> 59:04.917
It was a daring prediction.
He was off by ten years.

59:04.918 --> 59:12.458
Software development showed us a lot of
things; It opened our eyes toward the world.

59:12.459 --> 59:17.583
The pantry door was left open,
and we peeked outside.

59:17.584 --> 59:22.124
The world opened up; Shockingly,
it became a different world.

59:22.125 --> 59:27.833
Gábor Rényi did a great job; The Soviet
delegation came up with big Corvin shopping bags,

59:27.834 --> 59:32.458
they couldn't care less, but
he still showed them around,

59:32.459 --> 59:37.708
told them about „Operazie Nevozmozhno Dva”,
which was Impossible Mission 2.

59:37.709 --> 59:42.208
They looked at it, they left, we had
no idea why they were there,

59:42.209 --> 59:48.625
but it's certain that it contributed to having our
privilege to go to America and not be bothered by anyone.

59:48.626 --> 59:53.708
Software was our passport.

59:53.709 --> 59:59.541
It was very exciting, it was beautiful, and I
think due to the zeitgeist, irreproducible.

59:59.542 --> 01:00:03.958
What it meant, the window to the world,
was hugely important.

01:00:03.959 --> 01:00:10.625
It was one of Novotrade's most important businesses,
although probably not the most important.

01:00:10.626 --> 01:00:15.500
But for us, it meant our lives
for those few years.

01:00:15.501 --> 01:00:18.166
We were doing something unique
and special and different,

01:00:18.167 --> 01:00:24.041
because... the whole set up that Robert
played a massive part in putting together,

01:00:24.042 --> 01:00:29.291
you know, resulted in a whole bunch of games being
made that never would have been made otherwise,

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:33.500
and that have their place in
the history of the industry,

01:00:33.501 --> 01:00:37.083
not just in Hungary,
but, you know, as a whole.

01:00:39.751 --> 01:00:43.459
Mission Accomplished

01:00:53.667 --> 01:01:00.082
Novotrade America... which was essentially
Novotrade International... was growing strong;

01:01:00.083 --> 01:01:07.958
It was lead by András Császár, and his
entire team was working here in Budapest.

01:01:07.959 --> 01:01:13.583
After a while we as investors have left,

01:01:13.584 --> 01:01:20.708
and they continued to carry the
company Novotrade International forward,

01:01:20.709 --> 01:01:25.875
which was later renamed
to Appaloosa Software.

01:01:25.876 --> 01:01:35.750
Donát Kiss handed the baton to András Császár, and
he wanted to create a professional corporation.

01:01:35.751 --> 01:01:43.166
He restructured the entire company,
introduced a whole new working schedule:

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:50.124
You had to be in the office to work,
you couldn't just work from home.

01:01:50.125 --> 01:01:56.166
It wasn't just an administrative transformation,
it was also in terms of technology,

01:01:56.167 --> 01:02:02.041
infrastructure, mentality. It changed
into a more professional company.

01:02:02.042 --> 01:02:07.458
A lot of people didn't like it and left.
Others sighed in relief when they realized

01:02:07.459 --> 01:02:12.416
they like doing what they're told, because
it makes their life more comfortable.

01:02:12.417 --> 01:02:18.209
It was different, it looked a lot more
like a Western studio from then on.

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:26.124
Ami, I found a big stack of information about console
developments in Novotrade International's archives.

01:02:26.125 --> 01:02:30.833
Besides the Nintendo, they also made
games for Sega and even PlayStation.

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:36.833
Impossible Mission 2 also
relates to console development,

01:02:36.834 --> 01:02:43.374
because Ken Balthaser and Joe Miller
left Epyx... who we were working for...

01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:49.124
And moved to Sega of America,
and we stayed friends afterwards.

01:02:49.125 --> 01:02:55.374
A lot of these processes may seem like they
depend on the programmer, but they don't.

01:02:55.375 --> 01:03:03.124
This particular case, for example, depended on a wholesale
grain distributor from Indiana named Steve Friedman

01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:09.082
who suddenly became our agent,
without knowing a thing about computers.

01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:15.666
Steve was a very agile salesman, he would go
to places until he was able to sell himself.

01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:21.208
I remember, we were going to negotiate
with Disney to make them some puzzle game,

01:03:21.209 --> 01:03:27.708
and Steve goes up to this Pakistani on Hollywood
Boulevard to haggle on a video game cassette,

01:03:27.709 --> 01:03:32.750
and when he gets the price down to $1,
he just leaves... this took 15 minutes.

01:03:32.751 --> 01:03:37.875
I'm like, “What was this all about? Let's
go have lunch, why did we need to do this?”

01:03:37.876 --> 01:03:40.917
And Steve goes,
“I was practicing for tomorrow.”

01:03:40.918 --> 01:03:44.167
So Steve Friedman was the one
who made the Sega connection.

01:03:46.918 --> 01:03:51.041
It seems to me that Ecco the Dolphin was
their biggest hit on the console market.

01:03:51.042 --> 01:03:54.666
This might have been the best-selling
game ever developed by Hungarians.

01:03:54.667 --> 01:03:58.958
The idea came from Ed Annunziata,
one of Sega's producers.

01:03:58.959 --> 01:04:02.041
The idea was largely incomprehensible.

01:04:02.042 --> 01:04:09.082
He wanted something that was less of a video game,
and more like a film, like the one behind me.

01:04:09.083 --> 01:04:14.374
You weren't supposed to do a lot of things,
just swim left and right.

01:04:14.375 --> 01:04:23.249
Ed's basic idea in terms of user experience
was to be able to swim really fast,

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:28.416
for minutes, endlessly.

01:04:28.417 --> 01:04:35.166
He really didn't want
enclosed spaces or levels,

01:04:35.167 --> 01:04:42.374
he wanted to feel free in a large sea.

01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:48.458
My problem was among the lines of “Why doesn't it have an
assault rifle, at least then it'd be doing something.”

01:04:48.459 --> 01:04:54.249
Compared to the standard
“shoot everything that moves”

01:04:54.250 --> 01:05:01.500
and “advance forward while defeating enemies”
gameplay, Ecco was a breath of fresh air.

01:05:01.501 --> 01:05:08.333
It must be mentioned that the game's success
depended in large part on the marketing.

01:05:08.334 --> 01:05:14.666
Accessing a marketing budget is trickery,
but it's internal corporate trickery.

01:05:14.667 --> 01:05:22.249
A company like Sega of America has, say, ten to twelve
million dollars to advertise games in any given year

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:28.082
...how much money each game gets
depends entirely on the marketing person.

01:05:28.083 --> 01:05:34.875
So I would use these dirty little tricks
like going up to Al Nilsen and saying

01:05:34.876 --> 01:05:38.666
“Look, Al, we have this credits list
of who made the game,

01:05:38.667 --> 01:05:43.291
and I'd like to put you on top as
marketing agent, what do you think?”

01:05:43.292 --> 01:05:45.082
And he approved it.

01:05:45.083 --> 01:05:48.917
No-one else at the time
would put marketing names in the credits,

01:05:48.918 --> 01:05:51.875
and I think Al Nilsen thought,

01:05:51.876 --> 01:05:58.958
“I'll spend a few million dollars on Ecco, maybe
a few more people will see my name on it”.

01:05:58.959 --> 01:06:04.833
Mass sales come from people buying the San Francisco
Chronicle, seeing the ad with the dolphin,

01:06:04.834 --> 01:06:09.584
saying to themselves “I like dolphins”, “I
wanna save the world”, and they buy the game.

01:06:16.375 --> 01:06:22.708
I don't really recall any development project
ending with the satisfaction of a job well done.

01:06:22.709 --> 01:06:26.833
Mostly they ended up being nightmares.

01:06:26.834 --> 01:06:34.750
What you have to understand that games like Ecco
have to have two hundred hours of bugless operation

01:06:34.751 --> 01:06:38.208
before they're shipped to reproduction.

01:06:38.209 --> 01:06:45.041
And you have to imagine the first test you
do resulting in three to four hundred bugs.

01:06:45.042 --> 01:06:51.500
There are a bunch of testers who are
“idiot” testers, who report bugs like

01:06:51.501 --> 01:06:59.541
“I disconnected the power from the Genesis, and when
reconnecting, the game doesn't continue where I left it”.

01:06:59.542 --> 01:07:06.374
And these get reported, and it's great that they
do, but we have to sit down with the producer,

01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:13.166
read them all, mark them as “won't fix”,
and so on. But you have to write it down.

01:07:13.167 --> 01:07:19.208
And all of this because of the manufacturing,
you couldn't patch things later,

01:07:19.209 --> 01:07:23.917
the game was burned into
a ROM and that was it.

01:07:23.918 --> 01:07:31.291
If there was a problem later, they would end up burying
forty thousand cartridges in the Nevada desert

01:07:31.292 --> 01:07:34.541
...I'm not kidding, it happened!

01:07:34.542 --> 01:07:37.833
So the end of the process
was always a rush,

01:07:37.834 --> 01:07:43.459
there was no satisfaction or joy,
just “We're done, God, that's great!”

01:07:44.209 --> 01:07:47.917
Going through the list I can
find some other notable games.

01:07:47.918 --> 01:07:52.041
Besides Ecco and its sequels,
Kolibri was Ed's idea as well.

01:07:52.042 --> 01:07:55.249
Instead of swimming, the player
flew around on a hummingbird.

01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:58.666
Games like the Contra: Legacy of War
published by Konami

01:07:58.667 --> 01:08:02.458
and the Three Dirty Dwarves for
Sega Saturn are also worth remembering.

01:08:02.459 --> 01:08:08.291
Three Dirty Dwarves was about
three orcs arriving in the Bronx

01:08:08.292 --> 01:08:11.417
and busting stuff up.

01:08:14.292 --> 01:08:18.582
During the second half of the nineties,
I found more Hungarian-developed games,

01:08:18.584 --> 01:08:20.917
including Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,

01:08:20.917 --> 01:08:24.374
Adventures of Batman & Robin
and Lost World: Jurassic Park.

01:08:24.375 --> 01:08:33.625
We were able to join projects that were the
most popular ones in the world at the time.

01:08:33.626 --> 01:08:38.875
We've had some incredible opportunities,

01:08:38.876 --> 01:08:47.917
chances to join some development projects with
industry leaders with top-tier IP licenses

01:08:47.917 --> 01:08:53.917
...that would be unimaginable today.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.166
The company's story continues after the millenium,
but I only managed to locate vague information.

01:09:00.167 --> 01:09:05.041
For some reason I keep hitting walls when I'm
researching the period after the year 2000.

01:09:05.042 --> 01:09:09.416
One thing that is certain is that Sega invested
four million dollars into the company,

01:09:09.417 --> 01:09:13.207
which was running under the name
Appaloosa Interactive at the time.

01:09:13.209 --> 01:09:17.832
On the other hand, it seems that they didn't
contract them for too many projects after that,

01:09:17.834 --> 01:09:20.082
and there were internal problems.

01:09:20.082 --> 01:09:24.417
The company ceased to exist in 2006,
after twenty-three years of operation.

01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:31.417
Mission Accomplished

01:09:39.584 --> 01:09:44.999
In the eighties there was no
way to get games legally,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.166
so games were being
swapped in various clubs.

01:09:50.167 --> 01:09:56.791
The hub of this scene
was the legendary Csokonai Cultural Centre,

01:09:56.792 --> 01:10:00.750
also known as “Csoki”.

01:10:00.751 --> 01:10:06.541
Every Friday, Spectrum, Commodore, and
Amiga-fans would gather to swap software,

01:10:06.542 --> 01:10:12.917
and argue about whether Spectrum
or Commodore is better.

01:10:12.918 --> 01:10:19.458
But the Csokonai wasn't just important
because of the swapping,

01:10:19.459 --> 01:10:26.583
but also because many Hungarian games magazines
and development studios started there.

01:10:26.584 --> 01:10:32.958
One of them was Amnesty Design,
who later became famous as Digital Reality;

01:10:32.959 --> 01:10:40.875
Their first title, a space-strategy game called
Reunion, was released in the early nineties.

01:10:40.876 --> 01:10:46.291
This genre was continued by
the Imperium Galactica series,

01:10:46.292 --> 01:10:53.583
whose sequel, Imperium Galactica 2, is widely
considered the best Hungarian game of all time.

01:10:53.584 --> 01:10:58.082
We'd go to the club,
copy software, and so on,

01:10:58.083 --> 01:11:04.833
and essentially that was when we, who would meet
there, decided that we wanted to develop a video game.

01:11:04.834 --> 01:11:08.750
That's how Amnesty Design,
our first team started.

01:11:08.751 --> 01:11:13.416
We met, we became friends, everyone
had their own skill sets and interests,

01:11:13.417 --> 01:11:18.583
it was obvious who would do what,
so we said “okay, let's make a game”.

01:11:18.584 --> 01:11:25.041
We started basically from scratch,
from the very fundamentals,

01:11:25.042 --> 01:11:30.625
we didn't have commercial
tools or knowledge.

01:11:30.626 --> 01:11:35.750
Everyone started working at home, because
we'd were still attending school at the time;

01:11:35.751 --> 01:11:40.958
I was fifteen when we started Reunion.
Everyone was living with their parents,

01:11:40.959 --> 01:11:46.666
we could only meet on weekends to take a look at
what the others were able to do during the week.

01:11:46.667 --> 01:11:48.833
We had many meeting points;

01:11:48.834 --> 01:11:53.583
We'd always go to someone's place
whose mom could make great sandwiches,

01:11:53.584 --> 01:11:58.584
and we'd be there all day, trying
to put all the parts together.

01:11:59.709 --> 01:12:04.999
Ami, based on my research, the nineties look like
they were a fantastic time for game development.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.458
At the time, even a small team of a couple of guys
was sufficient to create globally successful games.

01:12:10.459 --> 01:12:15.208
Later on, these projects started to require
enormous studios full of developers

01:12:15.209 --> 01:12:17.291
and endless financial resources.

01:12:17.292 --> 01:12:21.374
But these guys threw together a demo
which was worth showing to publishers.

01:12:21.375 --> 01:12:26.458
We had a friend at PC Guru magazine,
Tamás Turcsán, aka Shy;

01:12:26.459 --> 01:12:30.458
He was the first to say that he's
gonna take this demo abroad.

01:12:30.459 --> 01:12:34.374
When he came back he handed off
the project to Gábor Fehér,

01:12:34.375 --> 01:12:37.541
who was also working at Guru,
claiming he had no time for it anymore.

01:12:37.542 --> 01:12:42.666
So the project was handed off and he became the project
manager to negotiate the contract with the publisher.

01:12:42.667 --> 01:12:47.999
I had no experience or contacts
to get any external references,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.291
I had to go to trade shows
to negotiate with publishers,

01:12:53.292 --> 01:12:56.751
to be able to show them
what it was all about.

01:12:57.375 --> 01:13:01.374
It might be stunning for a small country
that just transitioned from socialism,

01:13:01.375 --> 01:13:07.041
but a group of guys still in school managed to get
signed by the UK-based Grandslam Entertainment.

01:13:07.042 --> 01:13:09.166
Development took a
new turn after this.

01:13:09.167 --> 01:13:15.082
We started working in István Kiss' cellar.

01:13:15.083 --> 01:13:21.875
If I recall correctly, it was a three to
four meter long cellar, very small room.

01:13:21.876 --> 01:13:26.875
Everyone brought their computers in,
with their monitors and speakers and mice,

01:13:26.876 --> 01:13:30.333
and that's when we started to work.

01:13:30.334 --> 01:13:36.666
I was in my own room,
that's where I did the PC stuff,

01:13:36.667 --> 01:13:42.833
and two floors down the guys would
work in the cellar on the rest.

01:13:42.834 --> 01:13:45.625
During the summer, however,
I would envy them,

01:13:45.626 --> 01:13:50.333
because it would be ten to fifteen
degrees cooler down there.

01:13:50.334 --> 01:13:53.625
We'd develop during the
week and on weekends.

01:13:53.626 --> 01:13:57.708
During the week we'd go to school, if there was
nothing extra, we'd be done by three or four,

01:13:57.709 --> 01:14:00.583
and then boom, head to the cellar, work until
eight or nine, as much time as we had.

01:14:00.584 --> 01:14:05.167
On weekends we'd start in the
morning, and continue all day.

01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:10.291
Reunion was released after
3 years in development, in 1994.

01:14:10.292 --> 01:14:14.374
The project became quickly popular
among gamers interested in space games

01:14:14.375 --> 01:14:18.750
and brought serious recognition to the
developers. They didn't get rich from it though.

01:14:18.751 --> 01:14:24.541
The publisher would pay us continuously, but
usually they structure payments in a way

01:14:24.542 --> 01:14:28.416
that you get gradually
more towards the end.

01:14:28.417 --> 01:14:33.583
And in this case, they were reluctant
to pay us towards the end.

01:14:33.584 --> 01:14:39.249
I remember making calculations that if we divide
this two to three years' worth of salary,

01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:43.791
we probably got $30 as a monthly wage,
but we didn't mind.

01:14:43.792 --> 01:14:47.999
It was passion that drove us forward,
we wanted to do something

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.124
that the publisher would distribute
in stores all over the world.

01:14:52.125 --> 01:14:55.500
The feedback was already great initially,

01:14:55.501 --> 01:14:58.875
I remember reading articles saying that

01:14:58.876 --> 01:15:03.416
George Lucas should follow the example
of this small Hungarian company

01:15:03.417 --> 01:15:08.334
who did a game the Star Wars games
were supposed to be like.

01:15:09.209 --> 01:15:14.750
Ami, I'm looking at information that tells me they have
might not made a lot of money with the first game,

01:15:14.751 --> 01:15:20.750
but the success of it contributed to the fact that the
American GT Interactive released their second game,

01:15:20.751 --> 01:15:23.291
which was called Imperium Galactica.

01:15:23.292 --> 01:15:28.458
That was the same company that released
Doom II, Duke Nukem 3D, and Unreal.

01:15:28.459 --> 01:15:34.041
The most interesting thing about this game is that the
cutscenes between missions were recorded with live actors.

01:15:34.042 --> 01:15:38.917
This was a trend in other games at the time though.
Even Mark Hamill appeared in Wing Commander.

01:15:38.918 --> 01:15:45.249
We obviously didn't have a chance to sign
known actors, or any chance, really.

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:52.333
All we had was the ability to rent a serious
studio with a green screen for about two days

01:15:52.334 --> 01:15:56.082
and bring in a bunch of friends as cast.

01:15:56.083 --> 01:16:02.291
We got clothes made, which were a
bit Star Trek-ish, in hindsight.

01:16:02.292 --> 01:16:09.041
We went to a gym and asked the receptionist,
who was a beauty pageant winner,

01:16:09.042 --> 01:16:16.124
to play the wife of the protagonist,
who was another friend of ours.

01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:22.124
When the Americans saw this, one of
the producers almost had a heart attack.

01:16:22.125 --> 01:16:26.124
They didn't get how any of this worked.

01:16:26.125 --> 01:16:33.541
“What were you thinking? These people, they're
not speaking English? What's up with that?”

01:16:33.542 --> 01:16:37.166
“What do you mean 'what'?
You dub it.”

01:16:37.167 --> 01:16:41.791
“What's a 'dub'?” “When you rerecord
the dialogue in your own language.”

01:16:41.792 --> 01:16:46.416
“That's not a thing.” “Of course it's
a thing, everyone in Europe does it!”

01:16:46.417 --> 01:16:49.333
“Maybe in Europe, but
definitely not in America!”

01:16:49.334 --> 01:16:55.833
And we had to realize that they're in Hollywood,
they have no idea how things work here,

01:16:55.834 --> 01:16:59.583
they even re-shoot French films
with their own actors.

01:16:59.584 --> 01:17:04.416
So we had to realize that this would'nt
work, and re-edit a few things we prepared,

01:17:04.417 --> 01:17:09.292
and whatever we recorded on video was
just a still picture with text in America.

01:17:11.459 --> 01:17:15.374
You've arrived.
I've been expecting you.

01:17:15.375 --> 01:17:17.292
Affirmative, Sir!

01:17:18.209 --> 01:17:22.751
I've been watching you, Johnson.
I can see you're good at your job.

01:17:23.125 --> 01:17:27.082
Imperium Galactica was
eventually released in 1997.

01:17:27.083 --> 01:17:32.124
The publisher quickly ordered a sequel, considered
to be one of the best Hungarian games ever made.

01:17:32.125 --> 01:17:36.583
It won the best game music award at the
British Academy Film Awards in 2000.

01:17:36.584 --> 01:17:41.291
There were eight hundred entries in the
category that year, when this game came out.

01:17:41.292 --> 01:17:45.833
2000 was the first year the BAFTA
introduced a game soundtrack award.

01:17:45.834 --> 01:17:50.833
There were all these huge companies like
Electronic Arts and Sega and Nintendo

01:17:50.834 --> 01:17:53.416
lining up for the prizes.

01:17:53.417 --> 01:17:58.208
I literally fell off my chair when they
announced Imperium Galactica 2 won.

01:17:58.209 --> 01:18:05.875
I think what we owe this to is almost fifty minutes of
cutscenes in the game, all of which we scored music for.

01:18:05.876 --> 01:18:09.666
We spent a lot of time on
this during development;

01:18:09.667 --> 01:18:15.584
In three years of production I was able to spend almost
an entire year just making music and sounds for the game.

01:18:25.459 --> 01:18:30.458
We'd spend ten to twelve hour days
on it for a below-average salary,

01:18:30.459 --> 01:18:35.583
because we were motivated to make a
better game, and then an even better one.

01:18:35.584 --> 01:18:41.041
I remember there was a four month period
when I forgot to pick up my paycheck.

01:18:41.042 --> 01:18:45.708
It really wasn't about money,
we didn't even think about it,

01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:50.166
it wasn't a motivation.
We did it because we loved doing it.

01:18:50.167 --> 01:18:56.291
We were young, we didn't consider the effect of this.
We didn't even think about it, and it was great.

01:18:56.292 --> 01:18:59.833
If we would've thought about it,
we surely wouldn't have done it.

01:18:59.834 --> 01:19:06.374
It was better not knowing the complications, we
just faced them when we had to and got past them,

01:19:06.375 --> 01:19:08.917
that's what drove development forward.

01:19:08.918 --> 01:19:13.958
This software was published in over forty
countries, which was a huge thing at the time,

01:19:13.959 --> 01:19:20.708
we're talking about the year 2000. I don't think any other
developer reached this level of success in Hungary since.

01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:25.375
We didn't want to be better than anyone,
we just wanted to make a good game.

01:19:28.667 --> 01:19:32.291
Ami, I found tons of other games
and stories from the nineties.

01:19:32.292 --> 01:19:37.082
Here, for instance, is a project developed
by ArtGame called Abandoned Places, which…

01:19:37.083 --> 01:19:38.917
-

01:19:38.918 --> 01:19:42.374
Ami! Am.! Something is
wrong ..ith ..e com

01:19:42.375 --> 01:19:46.667
Agent 41-25,
I require a status report.

01:19:47.459 --> 01:19:52.250
Record the messa…
This is the most importa…sending…

01:19:54.834 --> 01:19:59.999
When we play games, our body produces
chemicals that it otherwise wouldn't.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:06.666
Actually not just while playing, but when
we're doing something nonessential.

01:20:06.667 --> 01:20:12.458
These substances are like vitamins,
they're very important.

01:20:12.459 --> 01:20:18.999
So the paradox is true, it's essential to do
nonessential things every once in a while.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:25.082
Games are great for that, but some
people find this feeling while working.

01:20:25.083 --> 01:20:30.249
There's a gamer in everybody, but most people would
never ever consider themselves to be a gamer,

01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:35.166
and even if they are someone that
plays Words With Friends or Candy Crush

01:20:35.167 --> 01:20:38.791
or whatever it might be, you know, they would
never consider themselves to be a gamer,

01:20:38.792 --> 01:20:43.416
but they play games, which is the important thing
for our industry, that everybody plays games.

01:20:43.417 --> 01:20:48.833
Games are a genuine art medium, and they've
had such a powerful cultural impact,

01:20:48.834 --> 01:20:54.999
it's really important that heritage
is kept for future generations,

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.625
because we'll look back and see just how important
the games industry has been for society.

01:20:59.626 --> 01:21:04.333
Games I think, have always had a bit of
a bad reputation in the general media,

01:21:04.334 --> 01:21:08.708
and that's quite wrong I think, because
games go beyond entertainment.

01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:14.416
You learn a ton of things that you find
useful later while playing games.

01:21:14.417 --> 01:21:20.041
You learn to think strategically, you learn to
lose, you learn to try over and over again,

01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:24.583
you learn to communicate, you learn
to cooperate, if the game demands it.

01:21:24.584 --> 01:21:30.791
I look forward to one day when the
headlines of the populist press say

01:21:30.792 --> 01:21:34.584
"games are good for you".

01:21:35.834 --> 01:21:47.009
Connection lost.
