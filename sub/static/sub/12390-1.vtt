Three.

You didn't describe them.

That's not fair.

What about the beanie?

01:42.300 --> 01:45.121
A beanie's a cap,
not a hat.

See, your information
was good.

So good, it could only
have come from the inside.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.811
Inside of what?

07:08.860 --> 07:11.749
Look, I've called in
dozens of tips, okay?

07:11.790 --> 07:13.018
Just check it out.
I did.

07:13.060 --> 07:14.948
I checked out a whole
lot of stuff.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.060
Like, oh, you're
currently unemployed.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.965
You've never held a job
for more than six months.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.195
And you have
a criminal record.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.867
I was 18.

07:23.910 --> 07:26.902
Oh. 18?
Well, that makes it okay.

07:26.940 --> 07:27.872

Look, forgive us,
Mr. Spencer,

07:33.820 --> 07:35.139
if this seems
far-fetched.

07:35.180 --> 07:36.784
Would it help at all

07:36.820 --> 07:39.243
if I told you that she had
a bit of a reputation

07:39.290 --> 07:42.214
and I was 0 for...

07:46.260 --> 07:48.899
Okay, fine. There were
extenuating circumstances.

07:48.930 --> 07:50.227

was my father.

to teach me a lesson.

Did you learn it?

07:52.940 --> 07:55.261
I learned I hated
my father.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.369
So sure.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.265
Pardon me if I'm just
a little skeptical.

07:58.310 --> 08:01.279
Believable as it is that you
solved all these crimes...

I'm sorry, what was it?

off of TV interviews.

08:17.260 --> 08:19.956
Can't you?
Don't you try and
trivialize police work.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.150

keep me here, guys.

08:24.900 --> 08:27.562

Good.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.737
Then you know
you have the right

08:28.770 --> 08:30.067
to remain silent.

08:30.110 --> 08:30.963
You have the right
to an attorney.

If you cannot
afford one,

08:32.710 --> 08:34.029
one will be
appointed to you.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.968
Wait, wait, wait.
You're serious?

08:36.010 --> 08:37.671
A few hours
in a holding cell

08:37.710 --> 08:38.802

Ah, ah, ah, ah.

Uh, there's suddenly a very,
very negative presence here.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.469
It's blocking me.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.365

His alibi checks.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.804
Question.

11:23.850 --> 11:24.942
Do I pay taxes
on reward money?

11:24.980 --> 11:27.175
I'll find out.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.472
Please feel _free
to call anytime.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.045
You know I will.
Magic touch.

11:33.890 --> 11:34.982
Oop.

11:44.930 --> 11:47.330
Doctor.

11:47.370 --> 11:49.292
Not so fast,
Mr. Spencer.

11:49.340 --> 11:51.433
Karen Vick,

11:51.470 --> 11:52.732
Interim Police Chief.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.270
I know.

11:54.310 --> 11:56.130
Heard about
what you did in there.

11:56.180 --> 11:57.442
Oh, you're welcome.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.402
That wasn't the phrase
I was going to use.

11:59.450 --> 12:00.940
I was going to say
improbable.

12:00.980 --> 12:03.778
Possible, yet unlikely.

12:03.820 --> 12:05.879
Look, it's hard to explain.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.148
I'm gifted.

12:07.190 --> 12:09.010
I was born that way.

12:09.060 --> 12:11.278
I knew your father.
He was a good cop.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.922
You're nothing like him.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.393
I take that
as a compliment, ma'am.

12:14.430 --> 12:16.227
Don't ever
call me ma'am.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.024
Am I still free to go?

12:19.070 --> 12:20.958
Not exactly.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.331
You familiar
with the McCallum family?

12:22.370 --> 12:25.237
McCallum.

12:25.270 --> 12:26.305
Yeah,
they own half the hill.

12:26.340 --> 12:27.807
Well, there's been
a kidnapping.

12:27.840 --> 12:30.479
Oh, come on. I had
nothing to do with that.

12:30.510 --> 12:31.943
Would you like to?

12:34.550 --> 12:36.245
The Feds are itching
to jump in on this case,

12:36.280 --> 12:37.542
and I need to make
some progress.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.012
What I need is a miracle.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.814
Or a facsimile of one.

12:41.860 --> 12:44.488
Oh.

12:44.530 --> 12:47.055
I see, I see.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.829
Well, I make $1,200 a day.

12:48.860 --> 12:50.828
It's a try-out.
That's what
I meant to say.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.223
This is pro bono.
Something for you.

12:52.270 --> 12:56.388
And if this psychic thing
is a scam...

12:56.440 --> 12:59.364
we will prosecute.

12:59.410 --> 13:01.332
You know hindering
a police investigation

13:01.380 --> 13:03.200
is a criminal offense.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.468
Sounds good.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.181
We're on the same team now.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.313
Kidnappers beware!

13:12.350 --> 13:14.011
[chuckles nervously]

13:22.300 --> 13:23.494
[phone ringing]

13:23.530 --> 13:26.522
(woman)
Central Coast Pharmaceuticals.
Can you hold, please?

13:29.970 --> 13:31.164
I have a job for you.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.098
I already have a job.

13:33.140 --> 13:35.005
They're paying you
to play video games?

13:35.040 --> 13:36.371
How do you do that?

13:36.410 --> 13:39.470
Come on. Left hand space bar.
Right hand arrow keys.

13:39.510 --> 13:41.410
Gus, you should ask me
a challenging question

13:41.450 --> 13:42.610
every once in awhile
just for kicks.

13:42.650 --> 13:44.288
I can't go anywhere.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.947
I'm behind on my route.

13:45.990 --> 13:47.082
I got new samples
of ceromoxicyllan.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.348
Oh, man.
I'm sorry.

13:48.390 --> 13:51.382
I didn't realize
the new butt cream had come in.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.591
So you're not interested
in hearing about doing

13:53.630 --> 13:56.451
the thing we've been dreaming
of doing since we were eight.

13:56.500 --> 13:59.936
I've got us the last job
we will ever need.

13:59.970 --> 14:01.437
[laughs]

14:01.470 --> 14:03.438
Shawn, you've had 57 jobs
since we left high school.

14:03.470 --> 14:05.438
Yes, I have.
And they were all fun.

14:05.470 --> 14:06.937
But this one takes the cake.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.278
Oh, yeah? Better than
your acupuncture clinic?

14:09.310 --> 14:11.904
_I didn't realize
experience was necessary.

14:11.950 --> 14:14.578
What about the summer you spent
driving the wiener mobile?

14:14.620 --> 14:16.076
I did that for the hot dogs.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.441
Look, Gus,
all those jobs I took

14:18.490 --> 14:20.117
because I wanted
the experience.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.411
But then I mastered it
and I moved on.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.987
But this job has a little
bit of everything.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.383
Come with me.

14:26.430 --> 14:27.897
Uh, no.

14:27.930 --> 14:30.228
I'm never doing anything
blindly with you again.

14:30.270 --> 14:33.159
I learned that
at the Mexican border twice.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.998
Okay, this is
hard to explain,

14:36.040 --> 14:37.007
but I'm going
to give it a shot.

14:37.040 --> 14:40.498
You and I...

14:40.540 --> 14:43.976
are opening our own
private detective agency.

14:44.010 --> 14:48.071
Oh.
See?

14:48.120 --> 14:50.315
No explanation necessary.

14:50.350 --> 14:53.217
Let me get my coat.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.558
But you're not
getting your coat.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.524
Uh, no. No, Shawn.
I'm not.

14:57.560 --> 15:00.222
All right, you want to sweat
the details? Fine.

15:00.260 --> 15:01.352
The cops think
I'm a psychic,

15:01.400 --> 15:03.265
and now we are investigating
a kidnapping.

15:03.300 --> 15:04.324
You're serious?

15:04.370 --> 15:06.099
Yes, I am serious!

15:06.130 --> 15:07.597
Six days ago,
Camden McCallum, Jr.,

15:07.640 --> 15:10.302
sole male heir
to McCallum Textiles,

15:10.340 --> 15:12.365
was seen being forced
into his Range Rover

15:12.410 --> 15:13.934
at the municipal
dog park.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.574
No one's seen him
or the dog smce.

15:16.610 --> 15:17.599
They took the dog?

15:17.650 --> 15:19.470
You see what I mean?

15:19.510 --> 15:21.046
I need you.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.241
I need you to--to write
stuff down.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.282
'Cause you know how I zone out
when other people talk.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.582
Just for today?

15:27.620 --> 15:28.985
Just today.

15:30.460 --> 15:31.722
you should bring
your sample case

15:31.760 --> 15:33.250
because some
of those forenSIcs guys--

15:33.300 --> 15:35.325
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.965
There's going to be
forensics guys there?

15:39.170 --> 15:41.968
(Shawn)
All right, pay attention.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.139
18 months ago,
Camden McCallum ran
his father's cigarette boat

15:44.170 --> 15:46.161
into the Morro Bay Aquarium.

15:46.210 --> 15:47.973
That was right after
he got caught

15:48.010 --> 15:49.329
with that hockey player's wife.
Yeah, I remember that.

15:49.380 --> 15:51.177
Guy hadn't been out
of the papers in five years.

15:51.210 --> 15:53.075
Since that day, nothing.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.371
Not a single news story.

15:54.420 --> 15:55.717
Not so much as
a dented motorcycle.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.217
Okay.

15:57.250 --> 15:58.239
What do you think?

15:58.290 --> 15:59.518
I think Camden McCallum

15:59.550 --> 16:01.211
is too good
at what he does to stop.

16:01.260 --> 16:02.386
Not cold turkey aanay.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.387
Beautiful women,

16:03.430 --> 16:05.182
fast cars.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.323
Doesn't add up.
Something happened.

16:12.370 --> 16:14.167
_ How should we
Introduce ourselves?

16:14.200 --> 16:16.065
Don't say "psychic."
They'll shut you off.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.567
Say something vague.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.407
Like "alternative
tactics division."

16:19.440 --> 16:22.603
How about the Bureau
of Magic and Spell Casting?

16:28.050 --> 16:30.086
Where are you going?

16:34.060 --> 16:35.311
You're rooting
through the trash?

16:35.360 --> 16:36.679
Just for a second.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.483
You are without doubt
the worst detective

16:38.530 --> 16:39.519
I've ever seen.

16:39.560 --> 16:42.199
Gus, everything you need
is right in front of you.

16:42.230 --> 16:45.028
You just have
to pay attention.
Oh, yeah?

16:45.070 --> 16:46.662
Look at this.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.400
Berenson's brand.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.601
That is the highest quality
dog food on the market.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.631
Perfect.
They pamper their pets.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.477
The case is almost solved.

16:56.510 --> 16:58.569
_ This stuff _
IS really expensrve.

16:58.610 --> 17:01.613
No additives.
No preservatives.

17:01.650 --> 17:03.811
Why would you possibly open
three bags simultaneously

17:03.850 --> 17:05.340
when you only have
one dog?

17:05.390 --> 17:06.516
They're rich.

17:06.550 --> 17:08.814
They waste money.

17:08.860 --> 17:09.815
Oh, my God.

17:09.860 --> 17:11.384
What?

17:11.430 --> 17:14.627
This CD case
is totally nice!

17:14.660 --> 17:16.252
Why would someone
throw this out?

17:16.300 --> 17:17.619
Here.
Put this in the car.

17:17.670 --> 17:21.299
Inside.
Now.

17:21.340 --> 17:24.207
Is it entirely too early
for me to have a theory?

17:24.240 --> 17:25.832
Can you at least wait
until we see some evidence?

17:25.870 --> 17:27.428
I suppose I could
if it would make you happier.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.248
Whoa.

17:33.350 --> 17:36.046
Just act natural.

17:44.790 --> 17:47.122
They know.
How could they know?

17:47.160 --> 17:48.593
They know.
We haven't said
anything yet.

17:48.630 --> 17:50.120
They know.
I can feel it.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.262
Oh, you're
a psychic now too?

17:51.300 --> 17:53.188
You're not a psychic.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.501
Gus, let's just be clear
on one thing.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.201
The only way
they can absolutely prove

17:59.240 --> 18:02.209
that I am not a psychic
is if I tell them.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.446
And I can guarantee you,

18:03.480 --> 18:06.369
that is the one thing
I will never do.

18:06.410 --> 18:08.844
Ooh. Ooh ooh.
Check this out.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.745
You got a lead?

18:10.790 --> 18:14.453
No.
But look at this girl.

18:14.490 --> 18:15.616
She must be the sister.

18:15.660 --> 18:19.118
God, she's incredible.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.422
Kind of have a few other things
going on right now, Shawn.

18:20.460 --> 18:23.566
Oh, Gus, look.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.194
Look how she went
from this awkward stage

18:26.230 --> 18:27.436
with this really
unfortunate perm

18:27.470 --> 18:30.166
to this beautiful,
amazing girl.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.404
She's a late bloomer,

18:31.440 --> 18:32.907
but what does--
what does that mean?

18:32.940 --> 18:34.874
That means depth
of character.

18:34.910 --> 18:38.573
Gus, she kayaks.

18:38.610 --> 18:42.910
[Gus breathing deeply
in and out]

18:42.950 --> 18:44.713
What, are you
Lamaze breathing?

18:44.750 --> 18:46.911
It helps.

18:46.950 --> 18:49.555
I cover a few
birthing centers.

18:49.590 --> 18:51.558
Just let me know
when the contractions
are two minutes apart.

18:54.330 --> 18:55.752
She reads Vonnegut.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.392
Wow.

18:57.430 --> 18:59.591
She's an aviatrix.

18:59.630 --> 19:03.407
Gus, I bet this girl
is spectacular.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.566
(Katarina)
Really now.

19:07.210 --> 19:09.804
I'm Katarina McCallum.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.673
I'm...thoroughly embarrassed.

19:12.710 --> 19:13.916
I'll bet you are.

19:13.950 --> 19:16.418
I'm sorry.

19:16.450 --> 19:17.610
I'm Shawn Spencer.

19:17.650 --> 19:20.483
The chief called me in.

19:23.460 --> 19:25.781
Everything's gonna be okay.

19:25.830 --> 19:29.391
Thank you for saying that.

19:29.430 --> 19:31.421
I have the same feeling.

19:31.470 --> 19:32.596
What makes you think so?

19:32.630 --> 19:34.336
I'm a psychic.

19:34.370 --> 19:36.691
They called in a psychic?

19:36.740 --> 19:39.334
I have very unique
and special abilities.

19:39.370 --> 19:42.931
Well, Shawn Spencer,

19:42.980 --> 19:44.902
if you need to ask
any questions--

19:44.950 --> 19:48.477
Just one.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.819
Do you currently have
a boyfriend?

19:51.850 --> 19:53.351
Is that pertinent?

19:53.390 --> 19:54.982
It very well could be.

19:55.020 --> 19:57.955
Uh, well, yes.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.891
I'm sort of seeing someone.
Nothing serious though.

20:00.930 --> 20:03.922
Nothing too serious.
That's good.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.323
That's very good.

20:07.740 --> 20:11.267
I think that's it for now.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.301
I'll be in touch.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.314
How do you luck into
these women all the time?

20:21.350 --> 20:23.511
Gus, please.
I am a professional.

20:23.550 --> 20:25.541
Gathering information.

20:27.890 --> 20:29.448
What are we looking for?

20:29.490 --> 20:31.424
Pictures
of that Katarina girl.

20:31.460 --> 20:33.428
Preferably at the beach.

20:33.460 --> 20:34.757
Maybe on her way to yoga.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.018
Or at a Halloween party
dressed as a cat.

20:37.060 --> 20:39.563
What are those for?
It's for anxiety.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.568
Is it ethical to sample
your own samples?

20:41.600 --> 20:44.637
Mr. Spencer,
the sketch artist
is here for you.

20:44.670 --> 20:45.762
The sketch artist.

20:45.810 --> 20:46.959
The chief insisted.

20:47.010 --> 20:48.329
Interim chief.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.541
Yeah.
You call her that.

20:50.580 --> 20:53.879
I'll be right back.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.876
Oh, yeah.
That's nice.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.979
Yeah, with the shading.
The shading's nice.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.339
Uh,

20:59.390 --> 21:00.709
here's a question.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.978
Do you think you could
have him looking further

21:03.020 --> 21:04.681
to the left--his eye line
further to the left?

21:04.730 --> 21:06.482
Shawn.
Yeah?

21:06.530 --> 21:07.792
Can I talk to you
for a second?

21:07.830 --> 21:09.320
Yeah, yeah.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.499
So just more to the left,
and I think we're there.

21:11.530 --> 21:13.930
What's up?
What are you doing?

21:13.970 --> 21:15.039
Just--just work with me.

21:15.070 --> 21:16.560
Tell them your blocked
or something.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.467
I'm gonna have
to use that later.

21:19.510 --> 21:22.377
Uh, how we looking
over there?

21:22.410 --> 21:23.547
Oh, that's great.

21:23.580 --> 21:25.639
Now look how good that is.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.477
See how he's looking off
to the left

21:27.520 --> 21:29.044
like he sees
something?

21:29.080 --> 21:30.479
As far as the hair goes,

21:30.520 --> 21:32.545
can we get the bangs
wispier

21:32.590 --> 21:34.478
like he's trying
to compensate for, like, maybe

21:34.520 --> 21:35.589
he's thinning
in the back

21:35.620 --> 21:36.780
and sort of got
a swoop?

21:36.820 --> 21:37.889
[Miss McCallum screams]

21:37.930 --> 21:38.988
Oh, my gosh!

21:39.030 --> 21:40.895
It's Bill!
Oh, it's Bill!

21:40.930 --> 21:43.319
Oh, honey, come here quick.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.462
Bill's the kidnapper!

21:44.500 --> 21:45.899
Um, um, um...

21:45.930 --> 21:48.637
That's the exact cap
I gave him.

21:48.670 --> 21:51.901
Okay, everybody.
Stop.

21:54.540 --> 21:55.507
No.

21:55.540 --> 21:57.098
No.
I'm sorry.

21:57.140 --> 21:59.973
Bill is not the kidnapper.
Not the kidnapper.

22:00.010 --> 22:02.808
Bill is just a horrible
human being.

22:02.850 --> 22:05.341
Who is "Bill"? I'm getting,
uh, multiple women.

22:05.390 --> 22:07.415
Is he a bigamist?

22:07.460 --> 22:08.711
Pimp?

22:08.760 --> 22:10.728
Does he sell children
on the black market?

22:15.760 --> 22:19.093
Mr. McCallum,
I'm Shawn Spencer,

22:19.130 --> 22:20.688
the psychic.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.696
Well, thank you
for coming.

22:22.740 --> 22:24.708
If there's anything
I can do...

22:24.740 --> 22:27.709
I can't imagine how difficult
this must be for you, sir.

22:27.740 --> 22:30.573
Nothing can prepare you
for something like this

22:30.610 --> 22:34.774
knowing you can't
do anything.

22:34.820 --> 22:37.539
Call me any time
with any questions.

22:37.590 --> 22:41.583
Uh, actually,
I do have one question, sir.

22:41.620 --> 22:44.726
How did he feel
about the dog?

22:44.760 --> 22:46.580
Well, he loved
that damn thing.

22:46.630 --> 22:49.497
Didn't do anything
without it.

22:49.530 --> 22:50.895
Yeah.
That'll do it.

22:50.930 --> 22:53.797
Thank you, sir.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.635
Does he like his dog?

22:56.670 --> 22:58.001
That's how
you investigate?

22:58.040 --> 22:59.632
I think
we're making progress.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.830
Since you've been here,

23:00.880 --> 23:02.438
all you've done
is dig through the trash,

23:02.480 --> 23:03.708
hit on the victim's sister,

23:03.750 --> 23:04.978
and falsely accuse
her boyfriend.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.671
Gus, he is not
her boyfriend.

23:06.710 --> 23:08.940
She made a point
to say they're free
to see other people.

23:08.980 --> 23:10.880
Whatever you say, Shawn.
Have a blast.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.547
I quit.

23:12.590 --> 23:14.012
You can't quit.
We just got started.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.755
(Gus)
Watch me.

23:17.960 --> 23:20.849
Gus, you're gonna
miss everything!

23:20.900 --> 23:22.128
It's gonna be fun!

23:22.160 --> 23:24.196
[starts engine]

23:24.230 --> 23:25.868
Gus, get back here!

23:34.210 --> 23:36.576
Fine.

23:36.610 --> 23:38.908
I'll solve this case
by myself.

23:46.720 --> 23:50.759
[door closing]

23:50.790 --> 23:53.588
[floorboards creaking]

23:55.060 --> 23:57.927
[objects clattering]

24:00.970 --> 24:03.131
[machine whirring]

24:11.950 --> 24:14.748
[cabinet opens and closes]

24:15.650 --> 24:17.481
Aaaah!

24:17.520 --> 24:19.488
Gus.

24:19.520 --> 24:21.511
I hate to imagine what
the rest of your plan was.

24:21.560 --> 24:22.788
How did you get in?

24:26.160 --> 24:28.128
Far less effective _
on a second-floor landing.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.796
What do you want, Shawn?

24:31.830 --> 24:33.866
Can I ask you something
about the case, please?
No.

24:33.900 --> 24:34.992
I was right.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.598
I'm done, Shawn.

24:36.640 --> 24:37.732
I don't want
to commit felonies

24:37.770 --> 24:38.964
and perjury
and pretend to be--

24:39.010 --> 24:40.261
You're dying to know
who kidnapped him.

24:40.310 --> 24:42.073
I know you are.
No.
No, I'm not.

24:42.110 --> 24:43.805
Because I don't believe
that you can solve a crime

24:43.850 --> 24:45.203
the cops can't by simply
walking through a house.

24:45.250 --> 24:47.616
Fine.
Fine.

24:59.190 --> 25:03.024
All right, whatever.
Who kidnapped him?

25:03.060 --> 25:05.665
Nobody.

25:05.700 --> 25:08.999
Nobody!
Excellent.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.166
Call the chief at home.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.861
Tell her
the crime is solved.

25:11.910 --> 25:14.879
Because apparently, we just
imagined the whole thing.

25:14.910 --> 25:17.105
Gus, nobody kidnapped him

25:17.140 --> 25:19.506
because he did it himself.

25:24.150 --> 25:26.641
Come on.
See for yourself.

25:26.690 --> 25:29.056
Okay.
Here's the thing.

25:29.090 --> 25:30.819
Camden didn't offer

25:30.860 --> 25:32.020
to clean up his act
voluntarily.

25:32.060 --> 25:34.028
Oh, no.

25:34.060 --> 25:35.925
Daddy threatened
to cut him off permanently.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.097
This was about
18 months ago.

25:37.130 --> 25:38.620
18 months?

25:38.670 --> 25:40.638
But wait. There's more.
He had help.

25:40.670 --> 25:41.830
VVho?

25:41.870 --> 25:44.202
This guy on the end.

25:44.240 --> 25:47.061
Malcolm Orso.
Only member of this crew

25:47.110 --> 25:49.305
that didn't go on to fame
or fortune or rehab.

25:49.340 --> 25:51.308
The cops must've
talked to him.

25:51.350 --> 25:52.874
Nope.

25:52.910 --> 25:55.572
Malcolm hasn't been seen
with Camden for quite some time.

25:55.620 --> 25:56.575
To be exact...

25:56.620 --> 25:57.917
18 months.

25:57.950 --> 25:59.713
Almost to the day.

25:59.750 --> 26:00.910
Gus, he has been
planning this thing

26:00.960 --> 26:02.359
for over a year.

26:02.390 --> 26:03.584
Shawn, this is good.

26:03.630 --> 26:04.688
Yeah.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.755
Where did you get this?

26:06.790 --> 26:07.927
Katarina McCallum's room.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.928
You didn't go
in her room.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.963
Gus, I needed a ride.
She hadn't eaten yet.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.264
One thing led to another,
and we ended up sharing
a milk shake.

26:15.300 --> 26:16.892
Whoa, wait a second.
Wait a second.

26:16.940 --> 26:17.964
You're dating her?

26:18.010 --> 26:19.034
No.
I'm not "dating".

26:19.070 --> 26:20.776
Yes, you are.

26:20.810 --> 26:22.072
It's not exclusive.

26:22.110 --> 26:23.805
What?

26:23.850 --> 26:25.841
Gus, come on!

26:25.880 --> 26:28.269
Put some clothes on.
This is gonna be fun.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.242
Let's go! I'm driving.
Where are your keys?

26:30.280 --> 26:33.044
Never mind.
I got 'em.

26:33.090 --> 26:34.887
Ooh.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.285
Should I slice
this up for the road?

26:51.740 --> 26:53.298
Well, we're off
to a banner start.

26:53.340 --> 26:55.274
Just let me do
the talking.

26:57.210 --> 26:58.245
Morning, gentlemen.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.838
Hello, officer.

27:02.250 --> 27:04.718
What's this?

27:04.750 --> 27:09.119
Whoops. It's my dad's
old police business card.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.411
Must've stuck in back there.

27:10.460 --> 27:11.757
Guess I've been
carrying that

27:11.790 --> 27:13.223
in my wallet for ages.

27:13.260 --> 27:14.955
Can never be too careful
coming from a family of cops.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.355
Henry Spencer's your dad?
Yes. Yes, he is.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.789
Well, how's old
Henry doing?

27:19.830 --> 27:22.833
Oh, you know Henry.
He's great.

27:22.870 --> 27:24.667
_ _ Re_tired_. _
LiVing in Miami.

27:24.710 --> 27:26.769
I saw Henry three weeks ago

27:26.810 --> 27:28.175
at the Home Depot.

27:28.210 --> 27:31.304
Yeah. Yeah, that--
That sounds about right.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.170
He popped into down
for a few days.

27:33.210 --> 27:37.010
Grabbed some supplies.
Some wood.

27:37.050 --> 27:38.847
Said he'd been back
for over a year.

27:38.890 --> 27:42.417
And now he's back

27:42.460 --> 27:46.123
running around
doing his thing

27:46.160 --> 27:48.822
Henry style.

27:50.330 --> 27:52.924
Tell your dad
the Kingfisher says hello.

27:52.970 --> 27:54.232
Will do.
Thank you, officer.

27:56.740 --> 27:59.402
Your dad's back
at the house?

27:59.440 --> 28:01.829
Apparently.

28:05.010 --> 28:06.875
Dude, I'm so excited.

28:06.910 --> 28:08.741
This is my first use
of spy technology.

28:08.780 --> 28:10.441
Yeah, it would seem
much cooler

28:10.480 --> 28:11.947
if it didn't have
Sports Illustrated
pasted on the side.

28:11.990 --> 28:15.414
Hmm.
Came with the subscription.

28:15.460 --> 28:18.088
Are you going to tell me
why we're here?

28:18.130 --> 28:19.859
This is the Orso
family cabin

28:19.890 --> 28:21.494
where young Malcolm
and young Camden

28:21.530 --> 28:23.225
spent all their summers
growing up.

28:23.260 --> 28:25.125
Wouldn't the police
have checked this out?

28:25.170 --> 28:28.196
Malcolm is so far out
on the periphery
of Camden's life,

28:28.240 --> 28:29.889
he's not
on the witness list.

28:32.240 --> 28:34.879
This is a great plan.

28:34.910 --> 28:37.970
Camden McCallum deserves
to be commended.

28:38.010 --> 28:39.978
Maybe you should
date him too.
Maybe I will.

28:40.010 --> 28:41.978
Let me see.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.419
Let's see here.

28:46.950 --> 28:49.384
Oh, no way.
What?

28:49.420 --> 28:51.126
It's Camden's dog.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.151
Get--Dude! Dude!
Oh, my gosh.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.452
I can't believe
we did this.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.798
This is unbelievable.
What?

28:56.830 --> 28:58.195
Okay, okay, okay.
Wait. Okay, wait.

28:58.230 --> 28:59.492
Let's call the cops.

28:59.530 --> 29:00.963
No, no, no.
Let's call the Chief.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.035
That's what we're gonna do.

29:02.070 --> 29:03.332
Call the Chief.
Yeah.

29:03.370 --> 29:04.962
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

29:05.010 --> 29:06.830
Gus, Gus,
we don't call anyone.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.235
What?
We go home.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.840
Then later at headquarters,
I suddenly and miraculously
have a vision.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.199
A vision?

29:12.250 --> 29:14.411
A vision of stuff we saw.

29:14.450 --> 29:16.338
Like the road sign
with the two bullet holes.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.780
Like the red kayak,
the yellow kayak,

29:18.820 --> 29:20.242
and the highway
with numbers.

29:20.290 --> 29:21.848
Oh, I'm seeing--
What am I seeing?

29:21.890 --> 29:24.484
8-3-1.
We're on Highway 138.

29:24.530 --> 29:27.897
Exactly. In the spirit world,
things get jumbled
and out of sequence.

29:27.930 --> 29:29.522
But my premonition
becomes clear

29:29.560 --> 29:32.495
when we all jump
in the squad car together.

29:32.530 --> 29:34.430
By the way, let me sit next
to that junior detective.

29:34.470 --> 29:35.789
Shawn, please.

29:35.840 --> 29:36.795
And alas,
we lead them here.

29:36.840 --> 29:40.003
Then finally, we both put
on our surprise faces

29:40.040 --> 29:43.874
as I guide them to the cabin
for the "first time."

29:43.910 --> 29:45.400
This is mine.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.769
[feigned gasp]

29:49.380 --> 29:50.369
What do you got?

29:54.160 --> 29:56.310
Gus, that's horrible.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.851
It doesn't convey
surprise at all.

29:58.890 --> 30:00.528
Gus!

30:00.560 --> 30:04.018
All right, let me do
the talking.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.560
Is there even an option?

30:05.600 --> 30:07.864
I want a lot of witnesses
for my miraculous VISIon.

30:07.900 --> 30:10.130
There they go.
Detectives!

30:10.170 --> 30:12.206
Detectives!
Detectives!

30:12.240 --> 30:14.379
We have a breakthrough.

30:14.410 --> 30:16.207
It is very important.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.299
I also have something
important. I call it lunch.
Make an appointment.

30:18.350 --> 30:21.376
But this is--
You don't have my interest.
You don't have my ear.

30:21.420 --> 30:25.311
Find a beat cop.
Tell your story.
Maybe I'll read the report.

30:25.350 --> 30:27.181
Good day, gentlemen.
After you.

30:28.490 --> 30:31.482
Detective!

30:35.530 --> 30:37.919
Don't eat the chicken.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.105
Don't eat the chicken?

30:53.350 --> 30:54.874
He's got your number.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.319
He's got nothing.

30:56.350 --> 30:58.147
I'll have
the chicken enchilada.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.181
Extra chicken.
Okay.

31:00.220 --> 31:01.050
I'll have
the cheese quesadilla.

31:01.090 --> 31:03.012
Coward.

31:03.060 --> 31:07.258
You're mad because
he pegged us as a couple.

31:07.290 --> 31:09.155
He was tipped off.
Did you tell anyone?

31:09.200 --> 31:11.623
Why would I tell anyone?
Let everyone think

31:11.670 --> 31:13.524
I'm working my way up
the ladder the hard way?

31:13.570 --> 31:18.109
You're barely separated.
It's been five months.

31:24.680 --> 31:27.308
So the plan was to annoy them
into believing you.

31:27.350 --> 31:28.476
Billy Camp's
working the grill.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.976
So?

31:30.020 --> 31:33.148
So?

31:33.190 --> 31:36.614
Billy Camp has the worst
hay fever I've ever seen.

31:36.660 --> 31:39.049
Feel this wind?

31:39.090 --> 31:40.250
Feelk?

31:40.290 --> 31:43.225
[Billy sneezing]

31:53.110 --> 31:54.236
I will be right back.

31:56.380 --> 31:58.371
Here we go.
Act natural.

32:01.220 --> 32:04.189
Okay.
What is it?

32:08.420 --> 32:10.251
Oh!

32:10.290 --> 32:12.429
Oh, my.

32:16.260 --> 32:18.364
This is great.
Now what?

32:18.400 --> 32:21.198
Does anyone have
any binoculars?

32:21.240 --> 32:23.333
No. No. You see,
we don't carry binoculars.

32:23.370 --> 32:24.962
Ooh, never mind.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.602
I found some
here in my pocket.

32:30.480 --> 32:35.076
There it is!
Just like I saw it.

32:42.620 --> 32:44.986
Want to tell me
what I'm looking for, please?

32:45.030 --> 32:48.124
Uh, I'm--I'm not
sure exactly.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.697
I see a bone?

32:50.730 --> 32:51.992
What, a human bone?

32:54.140 --> 32:56.734
Rawhide?
And a ball.

32:58.440 --> 33:01.739
Holy crap.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.008
Call for backup.

33:03.040 --> 33:05.440
What?

33:05.480 --> 33:08.244
What do you see,
Detective?

33:29.170 --> 33:32.105
[siren wails]

33:32.140 --> 33:34.631
I can't believe _
they won't let us in.
This is lame.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.272
And you were so polite
when you asked
the SWAT. team

33:36.310 --> 33:38.471
to issue you the Luger.

33:38.510 --> 33:39.807
Just make sure you act
in awe of me

33:39.850 --> 33:41.613
when they come to say
I was completely right.

33:41.650 --> 33:43.777
Oh, and maybe
a little afraid

33:43.820 --> 33:45.139
like my powers could possibly
be used for evil.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.384
Oh, watch out!
Watch out!

33:46.420 --> 33:48.183
Ha ha ha.
For what, its tongue?

33:48.220 --> 33:49.551
That thing could be vicious.

33:49.590 --> 33:52.150
Yeah. Diabolical
with its calculated

33:52.190 --> 33:53.589
decoy tail wagging.

33:53.630 --> 33:55.257
There's blood
on its whiskers!

33:55.300 --> 33:56.790
That's not blood.
That's Snausages.

33:56.830 --> 33:58.661
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.

33:58.700 --> 34:00.258
Either that or he just mauled
a mountain lion.

34:00.300 --> 34:01.631
Come on, Gus.

34:01.670 --> 34:03.535
Mr. Spencer, follow me.

34:06.410 --> 34:09.129
Now if there's any press,

34:09.180 --> 34:10.408
make sure you mention
our agency.

34:10.440 --> 34:11.771
We don't have an agency.

34:11.810 --> 34:14.449
Yes, we do.
I applied for a DBA on-line.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.209
Which reminds me,
we're going to need a name.

34:16.250 --> 34:18.616
Mind Masters,
already taken.

34:18.650 --> 34:21.187
Make sure you tell them
that we do private cases.

34:21.220 --> 34:22.687
'Cause I bet the department's
only going to be good

34:22.720 --> 34:23.857
for one or two months.

34:23.890 --> 34:25.380
You tell them.
I can't.

34:25.430 --> 34:27.523
I'm secretive,
mysterious, enigmatic.

34:27.560 --> 34:28.857
Delusional.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.164
Remember, act surprised.

34:34.270 --> 34:36.534
Wow.

34:36.570 --> 34:38.800
It is just like
I saw before.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.205
[barking]

34:40.240 --> 34:41.468
[whimpering]

35:07.270 --> 35:08.464
Pardon me.

35:08.500 --> 35:09.569
Ladies.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.158
Gentlemen.

35:20.780 --> 35:22.668
The department
has been approved

35:22.720 --> 35:24.415
to call on you again,
Mr. Spencer.

35:24.450 --> 35:28.682
Even though this case didn't
end up exactly the way we hoped,
I thank you for your services.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.381
You were invaluable.
Thank you.

35:30.420 --> 35:32.285
Thank you.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.321
You're making a huge mistake.
This case isn't closed.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.395
Pardon me?

35:35.430 --> 35:37.625
Murder, suicide?

35:37.660 --> 35:39.264
Come on.
You're buying that?

35:39.300 --> 35:41.689
I'm not buying anything.
Those are the facts.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.389
I'll buy it.

35:43.440 --> 35:44.862
I understand.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.832
I do.

35:46.870 --> 35:48.531
You'd like
to shut the book

35:48.580 --> 35:49.501
on this as quickly
as possible.

35:49.540 --> 35:52.247
It's fine.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.249
- They had a falling out.
- Before they got the money?

35:55.280 --> 35:57.578
Why? What did they have
to fight about
before they got the cash?

35:57.620 --> 36:00.509
Might I remind you,
Mr. Spencer,
you are not a detective.

36:00.550 --> 36:02.916
I just need to speak
to the witnesses again.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.484
The McCallum family
has been through enough,

36:04.530 --> 36:06.384
and this conversation
is over.

36:06.430 --> 36:07.920
Thank you.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.552
Uh, we parked
in a parking structure.

36:09.600 --> 36:10.828
Do you validate?

36:10.860 --> 36:12.327
Would it make
any difference

36:12.370 --> 36:13.496
if I told you
Camden McCallum, Jr.

36:13.530 --> 36:16.363
spoke to me...

36:16.400 --> 36:17.765
from beyond the grave?

36:20.440 --> 36:22.829
Shut the door
on your way out.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.939
[under his breath]
Damn it.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.474
What are you doing?
That was the Chief of Police.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.283
Interim Chief.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.685
And have you considered
that Camden McCallum

36:33.720 --> 36:34.789
may have been alive
the first time we went

36:34.820 --> 36:36.378
to that cabin?
No.

36:36.420 --> 36:37.557
Well, I have.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.992
I need to talk to that guy.

36:45.030 --> 36:46.964
Whoa, whoa. No.
Come on, Gus.
Just for a second.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.991
The man is practically
almost my father-in-law.

36:49.040 --> 36:52.601
Make no mistake, Shawn,
I will kill you.

36:52.640 --> 36:53.959
Okay.

36:54.010 --> 36:55.898
I appreciate
the fact that you think

36:55.940 --> 36:56.872
you can beat me up.

36:56.910 --> 36:58.878
But I think our last_ scuffle
proves otherWIse.

36:58.910 --> 37:00.673
Are you talking about
the Cinnamon Festival?

37:00.710 --> 37:02.473
Yes.
You do remember!

37:02.520 --> 37:03.771
Okay.

37:03.820 --> 37:05.447
First of all, I was six.
And I had a cast!

37:05.490 --> 37:08.015
Which many would construe
as a clear advantage.

37:08.050 --> 37:10.450
It's like having a weapon
attached to your arm.

37:10.490 --> 37:12.321
Oh, great,

37:12.360 --> 37:15.397
now the Chief
is staring right at us.

37:15.430 --> 37:16.454
Mr. McCallum!

37:16.500 --> 37:17.626
Chief wants them left alone.

37:17.660 --> 37:19.298
Well, we all want
to be left alone.

37:19.330 --> 37:21.696
Yeah, some more than others.
What's with his wrist?

37:21.740 --> 37:22.934
You don't give up,
do you?

37:22.970 --> 37:24.858
I do give up.
All the time.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.561
But not until the moment
is right.

37:27.610 --> 37:28.975
Now come on.

37:29.010 --> 37:31.444
I know you don't think
this adds up either.

37:33.610 --> 37:36.408
Okay, the rumor is
he tried to off himself.

37:36.450 --> 37:38.008
Off himself.

37:39.490 --> 37:41.378
The war hero?

37:41.420 --> 37:43.058
The man
who's seen everything?

37:43.090 --> 37:45.558
No. That's not it.
That's definitely not it.

37:45.590 --> 37:46.818
You know everything,
don't you?

37:46.860 --> 37:49.829
Yeah.
It's scary, isn't it?

37:49.860 --> 37:51.862
Something is going on,

37:51.900 --> 37:53.663
and I'm gonna find out
what it is.

37:53.700 --> 37:56.032
No. You're not going
anywhere near that man.

37:56.070 --> 37:58.038
In fact,
I'm going to make certain

37:58.070 --> 37:59.332
you never hear
from the department again.

37:59.370 --> 38:01.065
VVhoa!

38:01.110 --> 38:03.499
I'm getting strong vibrations
that you might be wrong.

38:03.540 --> 38:04.768
I'm on to you.

38:04.810 --> 38:05.845
You've got
a source somewhere

38:05.880 --> 38:07.347
and I'm going to find it.

38:07.380 --> 38:09.371
You think this is
some sort of game?

38:09.420 --> 38:10.341
I'm not going to let you
just waltz around here

38:10.380 --> 38:12.314
_ like some kid
in a candy store.

38:12.350 --> 38:14.659
Let me be honest with you,
Detective.

38:14.690 --> 38:16.351
_I used to work
in a candy store

38:16.390 --> 38:17.948
and it's nothing like this.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.029
You're in over your head,
mystic.

38:40.650 --> 38:41.947
[doorbell rings]

38:46.490 --> 38:47.946
Hi, Dad.

38:47.990 --> 38:50.379
Shawn.

38:50.420 --> 38:53.025
You didn't tell me
you moved back.

38:53.060 --> 38:55.392
You didn't tell me
you moved away.

38:55.430 --> 38:56.920
That was different.
Was it?

38:56.960 --> 38:58.962
Yeah. I was busy trying
to help my mom

38:59.000 --> 39:00.422
through her divorce.

39:00.470 --> 39:02.529
Well, it's nice
to see you, too, son.

39:02.570 --> 39:04.561
Can I come in?

39:04.610 --> 39:06.362
No.

39:11.180 --> 39:13.546
I was on my way
out to lunch.

39:13.580 --> 39:15.878
You can come with me
if you don't bring this thing.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.109
When I was
in the department,

39:24.160 --> 39:26.549
there were two things
I hated in this world.

39:26.590 --> 39:29.798
Private investigators
and psychics.

39:29.830 --> 39:31.388
Congratulations, kid.

39:31.430 --> 39:33.159
You just hit
the disappointment exacta.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.531
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

39:34.570 --> 39:35.935
It sort of happened
by accident.

39:35.970 --> 39:37.096
What are you gonna
do when you get caught?

39:37.140 --> 39:38.562
Move out of town?

39:38.610 --> 39:40.066
I'm not going
to get caught.

39:40.110 --> 39:41.668
Shawn, this is just like
everything else.

39:41.710 --> 39:42.904
Three months from now,

39:42.940 --> 39:44.441
you're going to be on a bus
going to Minneapolis

39:44.480 --> 39:46.004
cause you found your calling
as a weather man.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.779
It's not like that
this time.

39:47.810 --> 39:49.118
Have you been
listening to me?

39:49.150 --> 39:51.789
I finally figured out a way
to use my special gift.

39:51.820 --> 39:52.980
You should be thrilled.

39:53.020 --> 39:55.011
You're the one
that made me this way.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.984
I'm good at this.

39:58.020 --> 40:00.056
Oh.

40:00.090 --> 40:01.557
Oh, oh, I see.
You're so good at it,

40:01.600 --> 40:03.158
what are you doing
knocking at my door?

40:03.200 --> 40:05.020
You think I came to you
for help.

40:09.540 --> 40:12.008
Okay.

40:12.040 --> 40:13.632
There was no ransom drop.

40:17.010 --> 40:18.568
I'm not gonna be
a part of this.

40:18.610 --> 40:19.747
Come on.

40:19.780 --> 40:22.840
Would you just
hear me out?

40:22.880 --> 40:24.848
Okay.
No ransom drop.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.084
So what?
Big deal.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.588
So six days? Nothing?
Not even a demand?

40:28.620 --> 40:30.713
It happens all the time.
It's not unprecedented.

40:30.760 --> 40:32.125
They try to create panic
in the family.

40:32.160 --> 40:34.458
Yeah, I know. I know.
But not this guy.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.990
This guy wanted it
done quickly.

40:36.030 --> 40:38.726
I know that.
Well, then you
missed something.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.466
You've been driving
your motorcycle
all across the country,

40:41.500 --> 40:43.491
working your bungee cord
jumping expeditions.

40:43.540 --> 40:45.804
You're soft.
Hey, pal, it happens.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.102
I'm not soft.

40:47.140 --> 40:49.233
I'm sharper
than I've ever been.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.531
Close your eyes.

40:52.510 --> 40:54.068
Heh!

40:54.110 --> 40:55.839
No way.
I'm not seven.

40:55.880 --> 40:59.043
Close your eyes.
Any longer,
I'll think you're cheating.

41:04.830 --> 41:07.788
How many hats
are in the room?

41:07.830 --> 41:10.628
All right.
Fine.

41:10.660 --> 41:12.560
Just in case you're trying
to pull a fast one,

41:12.600 --> 41:15.797
I'm not counting the one
in your pocket.

41:21.740 --> 41:24.573
Nylon fishing hat
on the loner in the corner.

41:24.610 --> 41:25.872
Foam cap on the kid
who's too young to know

41:25.910 --> 41:27.844
they were lame
the first time
they came out.

41:27.880 --> 41:30.644
Both truckers.
One a concrete company
I've never heard of.

41:30.680 --> 41:32.819
The other advertising
free moustache rides.

41:32.850 --> 41:34.784
I'm fairly certain no one's
taken him up on that offer.

41:34.820 --> 41:36.913
Norwegian girl.
Ponytail pulled out the back.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.552
Unfortunately,
she's married.

41:38.590 --> 41:39.659
And our friendly bartender

41:39.690 --> 41:42.818
wearing the official hat
of the restaurant.

41:42.860 --> 41:44.566
Six hats.

41:44.600 --> 41:45.726
And?

41:45.770 --> 41:47.260
That's it.

41:47.300 --> 41:50.565
Sorry, pal,
there are seven hats.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.033
I can't help you.
You missed something.

41:52.070 --> 41:53.037
I didn't miss anything.

41:53.070 --> 41:54.537
There are seven hats,
Shawn.

41:54.580 --> 41:56.172
Were.
Before I closed my eyes.

41:56.210 --> 41:57.529
Cowboy hat walked out

41:57.580 --> 42:01.778
while I was ridiculing
moustache rides.

42:01.820 --> 42:04.880
Come on.
I heard her boots.

42:08.250 --> 42:10.912
All right.
Close enough.

42:10.960 --> 42:13.178
Close enough? No.
I nailed that.

42:13.230 --> 42:15.596
Yeah, but you
changed the rules.

42:15.630 --> 42:17.757
But, hey, if it makes
you happy.

42:17.800 --> 42:20.018
Change the rules.

42:20.070 --> 42:21.321
I did not
change the rules.

42:21.370 --> 42:23.861
What I did was nail it
and you know it.

42:23.900 --> 42:28.007
Shawn, you want my advice,

42:28.040 --> 42:31.339
go out, get yourself
a real job, grow up.

42:31.380 --> 42:33.245
In the meantime,

42:33.280 --> 42:33.974
you might want
to ask yourself

42:34.010 --> 42:35.716
who you're trusting
mmsmm

42:35.750 --> 42:37.945
that maybe you shouldn't.

42:37.980 --> 42:40.744
'Cause obviously,
you're overlooking somebody.

42:40.790 --> 42:42.257
Thanks for lunch.

42:48.700 --> 42:50.691
(Gus)
Why are we at
the McCallum offices?

42:50.730 --> 42:53.767
What is the magnification
on these things?
2X.

42:53.800 --> 42:56.792
Okay, we need to stop
at Walmart on the way home.

42:56.840 --> 42:58.137
Why don't you just take
your big, loud motorcycle?

42:58.170 --> 43:00.161
Ooh, here we go.
Here we go.

43:00.210 --> 43:01.939
Oh, hell no.

43:01.980 --> 43:04.107
You got me out of work
so you could stalk a girl?

43:04.140 --> 43:05.846
Damn it.
What is he doing here?

43:05.880 --> 43:07.643
I can't believe this!

43:07.680 --> 43:09.045
What's up with his hair?
It's horrible.

43:09.080 --> 43:11.048
I knew I should've had him
picked up for questioning.

43:11.080 --> 43:12.286
That is not the way

43:12.320 --> 43:13.810
a grown man kisses
a grown woman.

43:13.850 --> 43:16.751
We're--we're fine.

43:16.790 --> 43:18.189
Why does she look
so nervous?

43:20.260 --> 43:21.921
Oh, no.

43:21.960 --> 43:23.621
Is it just me or does
that bag look like it's filled

43:23.660 --> 43:24.820
with stacks
of ransom money?

43:24.870 --> 43:27.896
Give me that.

43:27.930 --> 43:30.296
Oh, my God.

43:30.340 --> 43:32.365
Katarina.

43:32.410 --> 43:33.900
It was her.

43:33.940 --> 43:36.204
You're dating a murderer.

43:36.240 --> 43:38.231
Not exclusively.
Wow.

43:38.280 --> 43:42.273
[laughing]

43:46.950 --> 43:48.884
(Gus)
You see, I knew
there was a reason

43:48.920 --> 43:50.012
she went for you
so easily.

43:50.060 --> 43:51.288
She wasn't lying, Gus.

43:51.320 --> 43:52.753
I know when people
are lying.

43:52.790 --> 43:53.984
Oh, yeah?
Apparently not.

43:54.030 --> 43:55.292
You just got played.

43:55.330 --> 43:57.389
[laughs]

44:01.940 --> 44:03.396
(Gus)
Should we call the cops?

44:03.440 --> 44:05.032
(Shawn)
Too late for that.

44:05.070 --> 44:06.298
You could pretend
you had a vision

44:06.340 --> 44:07.364
of a girl totally
manipulating you.

44:07.410 --> 44:08.672
Would you stop?

44:12.380 --> 44:15.315
What should we--
What should we do?

44:15.350 --> 44:16.908
There's only one thing
to do.

44:24.490 --> 44:26.355
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

44:32.300 --> 44:34.427
Shawn?

44:34.470 --> 44:35.698
Hey!

44:35.740 --> 44:37.332
Ha ha!

44:41.270 --> 44:42.476
What are you doing?
Helping.

44:42.510 --> 44:44.068
You're supposed to stay
at the car.

44:44.110 --> 44:45.805
You didn't tell me.
Well, come on!

44:45.850 --> 44:47.806
Gus, you locked the car?

44:47.850 --> 44:48.976
It's a bad neighborhood!

44:49.020 --> 44:50.749
What in the world's
gomg on, Shawn?

44:50.780 --> 44:51.917
I know what's in the bag.

44:51.950 --> 44:53.713
You do?

44:53.750 --> 44:56.082
You're good.
Very good.

44:56.120 --> 44:57.417
I didn't consider

44:57.460 --> 44:59.428
who'd be the sole heir
to the McCallum fortune

44:59.460 --> 45:00.927
if Camden was out
of the picture.

45:00.960 --> 45:03.292
Okay, okay.
Wh--

45:03.330 --> 45:06.163
You think I want
my family's money?

45:06.200 --> 45:08.065
You don't need it, do you,

45:08.100 --> 45:09.965
now that you've got...

45:10.000 --> 45:12.707
this money!

45:24.890 --> 45:26.039
We've got to get
better binoculars.

45:39.970 --> 45:41.858
Katarina...

45:59.550 --> 46:02.485
Go buy the bag.

46:02.520 --> 46:04.454
What, you want a souvenir
of your ineptitude?

46:04.490 --> 46:06.378
I need to get a better look
inside the bag.

46:06.430 --> 46:09.797
I'm not going in there.
That guy wants to kill us.

46:09.830 --> 46:12.390
Gus, this guy works
in a thrift store.

46:12.430 --> 46:15.228
Okay? He's a big,
furry hearted,

46:15.270 --> 46:16.430
good Samaritan.

46:16.470 --> 46:18.028
Come on.

46:18.070 --> 46:20.061
I'll be right here.

46:22.940 --> 46:24.271
Go ahead.

46:24.310 --> 46:26.107
Mm-hmm.

46:37.620 --> 46:39.019
What the hell do you want?

46:41.230 --> 46:43.255
Can I have the bag?

46:43.300 --> 46:44.426
You serious?

46:44.460 --> 46:46.018
Just the bag.

46:46.070 --> 46:47.423
Not the clothes.

46:47.470 --> 46:48.789
I'll pay you for it.

46:51.640 --> 46:54.973
You've got some nerve
coming in here.

46:57.140 --> 46:58.971
I can't believe this!

46:59.010 --> 47:00.443
Neither can I.

47:00.480 --> 47:01.970
I've gone to jail
for less than you.

47:02.020 --> 47:03.442
Jail's no fun.

47:03.480 --> 47:06.244
I'll tell you that much.
Oh, you've been.

47:06.290 --> 47:08.281
Once.
In Monopoly.

47:08.320 --> 47:11.187
Okay, hold on, hold on.
Who's that?

47:15.000 --> 47:17.127
Hey!
Move, move, move, move!

47:17.160 --> 47:18.593
Hey, get back here!

47:18.630 --> 47:20.029
You, hey!

47:26.140 --> 47:27.539
[engine starts]

47:27.570 --> 47:30.903
Go, go, go!

47:30.940 --> 47:32.339
(Shawn)
I can't believe

47:32.380 --> 47:33.347
you sold me out
like that!

47:33.380 --> 47:34.472
You didn't tell me
I was a decoy!

47:34.510 --> 47:36.876
Of course
you're the decoy!

47:45.290 --> 47:47.019
[sniffs]

47:49.500 --> 47:51.593
Seems pretty clean.

47:51.630 --> 47:53.325
What, they didn't happen
to leave a ransom note inside?

47:54.670 --> 47:55.898
Give me some money.

47:55.940 --> 47:56.964
Get your own money.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.467
Gus, I'll give it back.

48:06.150 --> 48:09.017
Seriously,
this is all you carry?

48:10.380 --> 48:13.178
Okay.
[clears throat]

48:13.220 --> 48:17.008
So we've got five stacks
going across.

48:17.060 --> 48:18.925
You figure four
going long ways.

48:18.960 --> 48:20.427
Ten stacks in each pile

48:20.460 --> 48:21.654
based on the wear
and the indentation...

48:21.690 --> 48:24.022
Depending
on the denomination,

48:24.060 --> 48:27.621
uh, this could easily
be $5 million.

48:27.670 --> 48:28.489
You're kidding.

48:28.530 --> 48:30.293
Give or take.

48:30.340 --> 48:32.365
You got that from a groove
on the side?

48:32.410 --> 48:34.037
Come on, Gus.

48:34.070 --> 48:34.934
Any small child
could've figured that out.

48:38.080 --> 48:39.945
So somebody at that house
did pay a ransom.

48:39.980 --> 48:41.572
Mm-hmm.
Or tried too.

48:41.610 --> 48:43.146
VVho?

48:43.180 --> 48:45.239
I don't know.

48:45.290 --> 48:46.712
We're going to need more
than my psychic powers

48:46.750 --> 48:48.547
to figure this out.

48:54.060 --> 48:55.652
Here to scope out
the new meter maids?

48:55.700 --> 48:57.588
Nope.
I am here to see you.

48:57.630 --> 48:59.120
Not interested.

48:59.170 --> 49:00.569
I know you. You have
someone special.

49:00.600 --> 49:02.192
He's married
and/or separated.

49:02.240 --> 49:04.367
Is there a point to this,
Mr. Spencer?

49:04.400 --> 49:06.004
Of course.

49:06.040 --> 49:06.961
You_ and I
have something in common.

49:07.010 --> 49:08.432
What's that?

49:08.470 --> 49:11.132
We both know this case
is nowhere near closed.

49:11.180 --> 49:15.173
Unfortunately,
gut feelings

49:15.220 --> 49:17.370
_ aren't_admissible
in a California court.

49:17.420 --> 49:18.614
How about motive?

49:18.650 --> 49:20.242
What do you have?

49:20.290 --> 49:22.258
Nothing.
Yet.

49:22.290 --> 49:23.416
But I've seen something.

49:23.460 --> 49:25.985
Seen or seen.

49:26.030 --> 49:28.328
Well, what do you think?

49:30.100 --> 49:31.328
Okay, what do you need?

49:31.360 --> 49:33.066
Everything you have
on Malcolm Orso.

49:33.100 --> 49:34.328
He was Camden's
accomplice.

49:34.370 --> 49:35.496
I'll get fired.

49:35.540 --> 49:38.191
Will you really?
Because it seems like
a gray area to me.

49:38.240 --> 49:40.162
That's the problem
with you, Mr. Spencer.

49:40.210 --> 49:41.359
You live your entire life
in a gray area.

49:41.410 --> 49:43.275
That's not true.

49:43.310 --> 49:45.198
Though I generally vacation
in gray areas.

49:50.420 --> 49:52.240
We can't talk here.

49:57.160 --> 49:59.185
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up.

49:59.230 --> 50:00.754
It says Orso was seen
in the town near the cabin.

50:00.790 --> 50:03.588
Yeah.
TWIce.

50:03.630 --> 50:06.019
Early in the week
by a store owner.

50:06.070 --> 50:06.661
What was he buying?

50:06.700 --> 50:08.520
Nothing.

50:08.570 --> 50:10.788
The old man just saw him
on the street.

50:10.840 --> 50:12.398
Same old man
sees him two times?

50:12.440 --> 50:15.329
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

50:15.380 --> 50:17.405
Orso had one of those
modified mufflers on his Nova.

50:17.440 --> 50:19.203
You could hear him
a block away.

50:22.280 --> 50:23.713
You'll need
a new target sheet.

50:23.750 --> 50:25.615
Oh, oh, no, no, no.

50:25.650 --> 50:27.186
This is, uh,

50:27.220 --> 50:29.711
this is fine.

50:29.760 --> 50:31.614
Wow.

50:31.660 --> 50:33.184
They're so much lighter when
they're filled with water.

50:43.770 --> 50:45.067
You missed.

50:45.110 --> 50:47.260
Did I really?

51:01.320 --> 51:03.550
Look at that.

51:03.590 --> 51:05.683
It's a perfect match.

51:05.730 --> 51:07.721
Damn.

51:11.230 --> 51:12.663
I'm telling you,

51:12.700 --> 51:14.497
there's no way Katarina's
going to talk to you.

51:14.530 --> 51:17.328
Yeah, well, I sort
of lied about that part.

51:17.370 --> 51:18.837
We're not here
to see Katarina.

51:18.870 --> 51:20.758
Who we here to see?

51:20.810 --> 51:23.608
This is
highly inappropriate,
Mr. Spencer.

51:23.640 --> 51:25.847
The investigation is over.

51:25.880 --> 51:27.643
What if they got
the wrong man?

51:27.680 --> 51:29.614
And who would
the right man be?

51:29.650 --> 51:31.117
You.

51:44.700 --> 51:48.568
Mr. McCallum, I didn't have
anything to do with this.

51:48.600 --> 51:50.534
I killed my own son?

51:50.570 --> 51:53.164
If it makes you
feel any better,
I don't think you meant to.

51:53.210 --> 51:55.804
You're not a detective.
You're not even a cop.

51:55.840 --> 51:58.502
You're right.
I'm a psychic.

51:58.540 --> 52:00.770
And I saw the whole thing.

52:03.350 --> 52:05.818
I see a ransom drop.

52:05.850 --> 52:07.784
You're doing everything
they ask.

52:07.820 --> 52:09.617
You didn't call the police.

52:09.660 --> 52:11.787
You're thinking of nothing
but the security of your son.

52:11.820 --> 52:13.856
After all,
what's $5 million to you?

52:15.760 --> 52:17.296
You're driving away.
I can see it.

52:17.330 --> 52:19.924
Something strange happens.
You recognize the car.

52:19.970 --> 52:23.235
You pass it on the hill.
It's Malcolm Orso's.

52:23.270 --> 52:25.568
You've seen it hundreds
of times at your house

52:25.610 --> 52:27.259
ever since high school.

52:27.310 --> 52:30.677
Maybe it confirms a suspicion
that you already have.

52:30.710 --> 52:32.575
You know where they are.

52:32.610 --> 52:35.249
You know the cabin.

52:36.720 --> 52:39.484
He's making coffee.

52:43.620 --> 52:46.657
You didn't mean to kill him,
did you?

52:46.690 --> 52:50.524
No. Just knock him around
a little bit.
Teach him a lesson.

52:50.560 --> 52:52.323
But he falls to the floor.

52:52.370 --> 52:53.928
He slams his head
on the oak table.

52:55.770 --> 52:58.534
He's dead.

52:58.570 --> 53:00.800
You know he's dead.

53:05.510 --> 53:08.399
Orso walks in, finds you.

53:11.680 --> 53:13.910
He's got a half-ass pistol.
But he's no criminal.

53:29.800 --> 53:32.360
You know there's only one way
to cover your tracks.

53:32.410 --> 53:33.399
You take care of him too.

53:36.710 --> 53:39.372
[dog barking]

53:44.780 --> 53:46.919
Make it look
like a suicide.

53:46.950 --> 53:49.748
[dog barking]

53:49.790 --> 53:51.849
Then you come home,

53:51.890 --> 53:53.858
inform the police,
and you wait.

53:53.890 --> 53:57.621
You wait _for a ransom call
that Will never come.

53:57.660 --> 54:00.367
Police eat it up.

54:00.400 --> 54:02.493
It's easy to look shaken
after all you've done.

54:02.540 --> 54:06.636
You might even be willing
to take your own life.

54:06.670 --> 54:09.707
You have _ _
an overactive imagination.

54:09.740 --> 54:11.378
Perhaps a side effect

54:11.410 --> 54:13.002
of your gift.

54:13.050 --> 54:15.769
Shawn, we need to go.
Not yet.

54:15.820 --> 54:17.640
I'm about to throw up
on a Turkish carpet.

54:17.680 --> 54:19.739
No, you're not.
It's in my esophagus.

54:19.790 --> 54:22.554
The second door on the left.
Turn on the fan and flush.

54:26.760 --> 54:29.490
I will not have this incident
rehashed over and over again!

54:29.530 --> 54:31.998
I know _
what your relationship was
with your son.

54:32.030 --> 54:33.622
Oh, really.

54:33.670 --> 54:35.991
I have a father that
I disappoint all the time.

54:36.040 --> 54:37.996
I'm sure you do.

54:39.840 --> 54:41.398
I know how you feel.

54:41.440 --> 54:43.431
This was it.

54:43.480 --> 54:45.345
This was the straw that broke
the camel's back, wasn't it?

54:45.380 --> 54:47.769
To think 18 months ago,
he sat across from you,

54:47.810 --> 54:49.619
looked you right in the eye

54:49.650 --> 54:52.483
and said, "Dad, I'm going
to clean up my act this time.

54:52.520 --> 54:54.442
"This time,
I am going to change.

54:54.490 --> 54:55.616
I swear "

54:55.660 --> 54:57.582
To know
that he duped you

54:57.620 --> 54:59.451
and you fell for it
all over again

54:59.490 --> 55:01.378
must've sent you
into a state

55:01.430 --> 55:03.022
that even you can't believe.

55:07.030 --> 55:08.827
Mr. Spencer,
I've been assured

55:08.870 --> 55:10.667
by the Lieutenant Governor

55:10.700 --> 55:13.498
_that this case
Will not cast a pal!

55:13.540 --> 55:14.802
over my family.

55:14.840 --> 55:16.068
But I can assure you,

55:16.110 --> 55:17.771
it's gonna cast one
over yours.

55:17.810 --> 55:20.472
My very first case,
I'm already
being threatened. Wow.

55:22.820 --> 55:23.718
(Gus)
Shawn, let's go.

55:23.750 --> 55:24.842
Not quite finished.

55:24.880 --> 55:26.381
We're going now.

55:26.420 --> 55:27.512
Listen to your friend.

55:29.960 --> 55:31.086
I'll be back.

55:31.120 --> 55:32.678
No, you won't.

55:38.060 --> 55:39.869
Okay, we're going.

55:39.900 --> 55:42.767
We're clearly going.
All right!

55:42.800 --> 55:43.767
Dude,
what are you doing?

55:43.800 --> 55:44.960
We had him on the ropes.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.137
It wasn't
the right tactic.

55:46.170 --> 55:47.467
Oh, you're
the expert now?

55:47.510 --> 55:48.636
Consumine.
What?

55:48.670 --> 55:50.035
Consumine.
It's for dog bites.

55:50.080 --> 55:52.378
I have some samples.
Gus, what are you
saying to me?

55:52.410 --> 55:54.048
I'm saying
there was a bottle of it

55:54.080 --> 55:56.469
in the medicine cabinet
prescribed Wednesday.

55:56.520 --> 55:58.044
You wonder why he had on
that long-sleeve shirt

55:58.080 --> 56:00.548
in the heat
that first day?

56:00.590 --> 56:02.717
Oh, my gosh. That dog
did have blood on his teeth.

56:02.760 --> 56:05.081
I told you
it wasn't Snausages.

56:09.500 --> 56:11.752
We're never getting
back in there.
I know.

56:12.830 --> 56:14.366
Just give me a second.

56:16.440 --> 56:18.067
What are you doing?

56:18.100 --> 56:19.738
- I'm thinking.
- You look ridiculous.

56:23.810 --> 56:26.802
Now what are you doing?
I'm calling the cops.

56:26.850 --> 56:29.614
For what?
You heard the guy in there.
They're never going to come.

56:29.650 --> 56:31.868
I'm not calling the cops on him.
I'm calling the cops on us.

56:31.920 --> 56:35.185
We need this to play out
in front of an audience with
all the major players in place.

56:35.220 --> 56:37.188
(woman) Santa Barbara
Police Department.
Yes. Hello.

56:37.220 --> 56:38.858
I'm calling
from the McCallum residence.

56:38.890 --> 56:40.778
There's an intruder here
who Simply won't leave.

56:40.830 --> 56:42.855
He's claiming to be a psychic
that works for your department.

56:42.900 --> 56:45.118
Pardon me?

56:45.160 --> 56:48.197
Mr. McCallum is enraged,
and he wants this handled by
the highest authority possible.

56:48.230 --> 56:50.039
Please send the Chief
immediately.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.433
[Shawn sniffs]

56:55.940 --> 56:57.168
Did you really vomit?

57:03.020 --> 57:04.715
Who called them?

57:04.750 --> 57:08.083
I don't know, sir.
Maybe the back staff.

57:08.120 --> 57:11.578
Those two gentlemen
have not left
the driveway.

57:11.620 --> 57:13.952
Would you like me
to send them all away?
No.

57:13.990 --> 57:15.082
Let's finish this.

57:16.730 --> 57:20.598
As you can see, Karen,
this simply cannot happen.

57:20.630 --> 57:22.666
It'll be taken care of.
Believe me.

57:22.700 --> 57:24.964
He was given clear
instructions to stay away.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.729
I understand, but...

57:26.770 --> 57:29.238
It's times like this
I remember why I love
my job so much.

57:29.270 --> 57:30.737
Any time, Shawn.

57:30.780 --> 57:32.600
He's getting coclq.
Give it a sec.

57:32.650 --> 57:34.743
We're gonna be
in a city jail in a sec.

57:34.780 --> 57:36.941
Uh-huh. Here we are.

57:36.980 --> 57:37.947
[thud]
Oh!

57:37.980 --> 57:40.141
I'm sorry.
Did that hurt?

57:41.620 --> 57:42.814
Ah, something's happening!

57:42.860 --> 57:43.918
Ah!
Stop it!

57:43.960 --> 57:44.915
Gus!

57:44.960 --> 57:45.949
Something's happening!

57:45.990 --> 57:47.457
Stop it.
Ah! Ah!

57:49.230 --> 57:50.595
Wait.

57:50.630 --> 57:52.097
Ah!

57:53.630 --> 57:54.927
The dog!
Shut up.

57:54.970 --> 57:57.188
He's biting the intruder!

57:58.840 --> 58:01.707
He knows him!
It's someone he knows!
The dog knows him!

58:01.740 --> 58:02.900
Stop talking.

58:02.940 --> 58:05.079
Ouch! Ow!

58:05.110 --> 58:06.543
The teeth are digging in.

58:06.580 --> 58:07.649
Shut up!
Oh, there's blood!

58:07.680 --> 58:09.272
Ah! Ah!

58:09.310 --> 58:12.279
It's him! It's McCallum!

58:12.320 --> 58:14.880
I can see his face!
The killer is McCallum.

58:14.920 --> 58:15.909
Check his wrist!

58:15.960 --> 58:17.211
Check his right wrist!

58:17.260 --> 58:18.852
The teeth marks
will match up!

58:18.890 --> 58:19.925
Get him out of here!

58:19.960 --> 58:21.188
Check the wrist!

58:21.230 --> 58:24.529
No one is checking
any part of me.

58:24.560 --> 58:25.822
Why not?
Huh?

58:27.700 --> 58:30.168
We could close this out
immediately,
discredit him right here.

58:31.600 --> 58:34.034
That's an awful wound
you have bandaged there.

58:34.070 --> 58:36.231
This is outrageous!

58:36.280 --> 58:37.679
Do you really
want to do this?

58:37.710 --> 58:40.304
We could do this now...

58:40.350 --> 58:41.601
or I could
call in a warrant.

58:41.650 --> 58:43.140
I'll call my lawyer.

58:44.820 --> 58:45.980
I'll be right here.

58:47.650 --> 58:48.947
I see a doctor!

58:48.990 --> 58:50.150
I'm seeing a doctor.

58:50.190 --> 58:52.010
Dr. Bendali.
And a word.

58:52.060 --> 58:53.925
Consumine.

58:53.960 --> 58:56.849
Yeah, it's for dog bites.
The wound is fresh.

58:56.900 --> 58:58.549
Check the wound!

58:58.600 --> 59:01.694
It's a fresh wound.
It's still a fresh wound.

59:07.040 --> 59:08.564
I-It was an accident.

59:08.610 --> 59:09.679
I-I didn't--

59:09.710 --> 59:11.200
What?

59:15.210 --> 59:16.814
Sergeant.

59:20.050 --> 59:21.688
(Sergeant)
Come this way, sir.

59:23.720 --> 59:26.848
You want to take these cuffs
off of me, please?

59:28.660 --> 59:30.799
Thank you.

59:34.770 --> 59:36.658
Seriously.

59:36.700 --> 59:38.861
How?

59:38.900 --> 59:41.698
I wish I knew.

59:49.820 --> 59:52.789
So, you think this
pretty much ruins
my chances with Katarina?

1:00:06.330 --> 1:00:07.968
There she is.

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:09.968
Don't ever walk into my office
without knocking.

1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:11.661
I'm sorry.
I got excited.

1:00:11.700 --> 1:00:12.837
You know
what I'll do to you?

1:00:12.870 --> 1:00:14.064
Yes.
You do?

1:00:14.110 --> 1:00:15.259
I'm a psychic.

1:00:16.810 --> 1:00:18.698
I'm just finishing up in here.

1:00:18.740 --> 1:00:20.241
I'll be with you
in a moment.

1:00:20.280 --> 1:00:22.748
That's all right.
I've gotta get going.
Thank you for coming.

1:00:22.780 --> 1:00:24.975
You've been
a big help.

1:00:27.020 --> 1:00:28.988
Dad.

1:00:30.860 --> 1:00:32.851
Have a seat.

1:00:35.290 --> 1:00:37.656
I was considering adding you
to my speed dial, Mr. Spencer,

1:00:37.700 --> 1:00:39.053
but I would be remiss
if I didn't do

1:00:40.770 --> 1:00:43.830
Uh...yes?

1:00:43.870 --> 1:00:46.065
I asked your dad how long
you've had the gift.

1:00:46.110 --> 1:00:48.738
Look, my father's memory
is pretty cloudy.

1:00:48.770 --> 1:00:51.136
Oh, it certainly is.

1:00:51.180 --> 1:00:53.375
His recollection doesn't match
up With your assertion at all.

1:00:53.410 --> 1:00:55.275
I can explain that.

1:00:55.310 --> 1:00:57.278
You said you've had
this ability your whole life.

1:00:57.320 --> 1:00:59.345
Well...whole life.

1:00:59.380 --> 1:01:01.189
I mean, it's a bit
of a gray area.

1:01:01.220 --> 1:01:03.051
He said you didn't get it
until you were 18.

1:01:04.290 --> 1:01:05.359
He said that?

1:01:05.390 --> 1:01:06.880
Mm-hmm.

1:01:08.930 --> 1:01:10.921
Wow.

1:01:10.960 --> 1:01:12.097
That is just like him.

1:01:12.130 --> 1:01:13.995
The man simply refuses
to acknowledge

1:01:14.030 --> 1:01:16.362
my abilities,
my gifts.

1:01:16.400 --> 1:01:18.197
Can we discuss my fee?

1:01:20.410 --> 1:01:21.968
There's a check
in the cage.

1:01:23.910 --> 1:01:25.741
Sign for it
and then come back in.

1:01:25.780 --> 1:01:28.203
Come--come back in here?

1:01:28.250 --> 1:01:29.877
Mm-hmm.
Why?

1:01:31.250 --> 1:01:33.241
You familiar with
a chop shop in Summerland?

1:01:37.790 --> 1:01:39.382
Dad!

1:01:41.230 --> 1:01:43.721
So are you gonna continue
with this little charade?

1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:46.820
Well, it sort of gives me
carte blanche, you know.

1:01:46.870 --> 1:01:49.498
I mean, I can work cases
for the department.

1:01:49.530 --> 1:01:51.031
I can do private jobs.

1:01:51.070 --> 1:01:53.732
In fact, I've already
got another case.

1:01:53.770 --> 1:01:56.136
Be aware.

1:01:56.180 --> 1:01:58.171
This is the last time
I cover for you, pal.

1:02:01.910 --> 1:02:04.140
I'm not okay
with this, Shawn.

1:02:04.180 --> 1:02:06.978
Any of it.

1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:14.448
I don't expect you
to be, Dad.

1:02:14.490 --> 1:02:16.299
[engine starts]

1:02:42.390 --> 1:02:44.119
Awesome!

1:02:50.260 --> 1:02:51.329
Psych?

1:02:52.870 --> 1:02:54.019
As in, "Got you."

1:02:54.070 --> 1:02:57.392
Or as in "psych-ic."

1:02:59.400 --> 1:03:03.131
You named your fake
detective agency Psych?

1:03:03.180 --> 1:03:04.477
Why don't you
just call it,

1:03:04.510 --> 1:03:06.273
"Hey, We're Fooling You
and the Police Department.

1:03:06.310 --> 1:03:07.447
"Hope We Don't
Make a Mistake

1:03:07.480 --> 1:03:08.947
and Someone Dies
Because of It."

1:03:08.980 --> 1:03:11.119
First of all, Gus, that name
is entirely too long.

1:03:11.150 --> 1:03:12.412
It would never fit
on the Window.

1:03:12.450 --> 1:03:14.145
And secondly, the best way
to convince people

1:03:14.190 --> 1:03:17.887
you're not lying to them
is to tell them you are.

1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:19.080
Whatever, Shawn.

1:03:19.120 --> 1:03:20.382
It's your agency.
Go for it.

1:03:20.430 --> 1:03:22.386
Actually...

1:03:22.430 --> 1:03:24.557
it's our agency.

1:03:26.200 --> 1:03:28.327
I put your name
on the lease as well.

1:03:28.370 --> 1:03:30.838
Tell me_. Does that look
anything like your Signature?

1:03:30.870 --> 1:03:32.360
I gave it a shot.
This better be a joke.

1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:35.460
Don't worry.
You won't have to do a thing.

1:03:35.510 --> 1:03:37.375
I have worked out
every last detail.

1:03:37.410 --> 1:03:39.230
- What's your dental plan?
- Don't get cavities.

1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:41.840
- Health plan?
- Same, but with Hepatitis
and shingles.

1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:43.347
So I'm supposed
to quit my job,

1:03:43.380 --> 1:03:45.416
skip over, and do this
for no guaranteed money.

1:03:45.450 --> 1:03:48.010
No guaranteed money,
but all guaranteed fun!

1:03:48.050 --> 1:03:50.154
No! No more cases, Shawn.

1:03:50.190 --> 1:03:52.488
It was fun for a few days.

1:03:54.060 --> 1:03:55.288
Well, it's gonna
have to be fun

1:03:55.330 --> 1:03:56.592
for a minimum
of SIX months,

1:03:56.630 --> 1:03:58.291
or we'll have to pay
a lease penalty.

1:03:58.330 --> 1:03:59.866
Which would be a blemish

1:03:59.900 --> 1:04:01.299
on your otherwise
very impressive credit report.

1:04:01.330 --> 1:04:03.469
You solved one mystery

1:04:03.500 --> 1:04:04.899
and now you renting
office space?

1:04:04.940 --> 1:04:06.259
Gus!

1:04:06.310 --> 1:04:08.107
I've solved
a bunch of mysteries.

1:04:08.140 --> 1:04:10.904
For instance, the mystery of who
kept stealing your newspaper.

1:04:10.940 --> 1:04:12.077
Answer: me!

1:04:12.110 --> 1:04:13.998
The mystery of What
we're doing this weekend.

1:04:14.050 --> 1:04:15.915
Hint.
It involves dragsters.

1:04:15.950 --> 1:04:17.315
And finally,

1:04:17.350 --> 1:04:19.511
the mystery that is the case

1:04:19.550 --> 1:04:21.381
the Chief
just brought me in on.

1:04:22.650 --> 1:04:24.459
You got another case
already?

1:04:24.490 --> 1:04:26.981
A car thief got poisoned
by his boss.

1:04:27.030 --> 1:04:29.385
He used something
over the counter.

1:04:29.430 --> 1:04:31.022
Phisidine.
No.

1:04:31.060 --> 1:04:32.994
Phisadirble.
No.

1:04:33.030 --> 1:04:34.918
Uh...Ph--
Phisadrine?

1:04:34.970 --> 1:04:35.937
That's it!

1:04:35.970 --> 1:04:38.188
Wow.
How'd he do that?

1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:40.606
I'll tell you on the way.

1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:43.407
Just for today, right?

1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:44.577
Absolutely.

1:04:48.110 --> 1:04:49.372
[engine starts]

1:04:53.290 --> 1:04:54.518
* I know you know

1:04:54.550 --> 1:04:56.586
* That I'm not telling
the truth *

1:04:56.620 --> 1:04:58.156
* I know you know

1:04:58.190 --> 1:04:59.487
* They just don't have
any proof *

1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:01.226
* Where's the deception

1:05:01.260 --> 1:05:02.625
* Learn how to bend

1:05:02.660 --> 1:05:04.423
* Your worst inhibitions

1:05:04.460 --> 1:05:07.258
* Tend to psych you out
in the end *

1:05:07.300 --> 1:05:09.427
* I know you know

1:05:09.470 --> 1:05:11.961
* I know you know

1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:17.178
* I know you know

1:05:17.210 --> 1:05:19.474
* I know you know

1:05:19.510 --> 1:05:27.110
*

1:05:27.150 --> 1:05:31.189
* In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity *

1:05:31.220 --> 1:05:34.451
* I'm not inclined
to re5ign to maturity *

1:05:34.490 --> 1:05:37.948
* If it's all right
then you're all wrong *

1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:43.028
* But why bounce around
to the same damn song *

1:05:43.070 --> 1:05:49.236
* You'd rather run
when you can crawl *

1:05:49.270 --> 1:05:50.430
* I know you know

1:05:50.480 --> 1:05:52.277
* That I'm not telling
the truth *

1:05:52.310 --> 1:05:54.244
* I know you know

1:05:54.280 --> 1:05:55.406
* They just don't have
any proof *

1:05:55.450 --> 1:05:57.247
* Where's the deception

1:05:57.280 --> 1:05:59.214
* Learn how to bend

1:05:59.250 --> 1:06:00.387
* Your worst inhibitions

1:06:00.420 --> 1:06:03.514
* Tend to psych you out
in the end *
