02:41.828 --> 02:43.118
but I don't
wanna go in there.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.413
Why not?

02:44.623 --> 02:47.173
Well, what
if there's bugs?

02:49.378 --> 02:51.458
I don't care if it smells
and there's bugs running around.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.552
If we're getting back in
that car again tonight,

02:53.757 --> 02:54.927
you're driving.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.047
Okay, well, I'll look at it.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.716
I don't care
if it's ugly, baby.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.144
There's a bed.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.185
Well, you know,
i bet you there's bugs

03:07.187 --> 03:08.397

Have a look.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.478
I am gonna look.

03:30.252 --> 03:31.042
Hey!

03:31.545 --> 03:32.665
Hey mister.

03:32.671 --> 03:33.421
What do you
think you're doing?

03:33.422 --> 03:34.302
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.257
Take it easy. Take it easy.

03:35.257 --> 03:36.087
Take it easy. I'm out.

03:36.091 --> 03:37.471
I'm out of the car, okay.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.217
It was just an honest,
little mistake.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.969
I got into the wrong car.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.558
Looks exactly like my car.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.184
Look, I said I was sorry. Okay?

03:46.351 --> 03:47.691
All right, college boy.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.561
Get into your room.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.404
Help! Somebody help us!

03:53.775 --> 03:55.935
Lady, I swear
I'll kill you now!

03:56.319 --> 03:57.359
Don't even think it.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.572
I mean don't even think it.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.452
Move. Get.

03:59.448 --> 04:00.698
Get, get, get, get. Fast.

04:00.991 --> 04:01.701
Move.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.030
Get, get, get, get.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.833
<i>A sound
explodes in my head.</i>

04:10.292 --> 04:12.592
<i>I want my mother's
arms to make me safe.</i>

04:59.174 --> 05:01.344
Hello! I've got it!

05:03.595 --> 05:05.215
Major!

05:05.388 --> 05:07.518
Slue! C'mere!

05:07.682 --> 05:09.732
Jackpot!

05:09.976 --> 05:11.096
Come on out!

05:12.270 --> 05:13.230
Come on!

05:22.447 --> 05:24.317
My, my, don't you look pretty.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.621
My dogs didn't even bark at you,

05:26.827 --> 05:28.157
'cause they know you're a
weaselly piece of shit.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.290
Now what do you have for me?

05:29.454 --> 05:30.754
It's in the trunk.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.827
Get out of the car.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.630
- Look I got you a-
- give me the keys.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.416
I got you a TV,
a beautiful TV,

05:36.628 --> 05:38.208
and the car trunk
is full of stuff.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.643
Didn't have any trouble
getting this car, did you?

05:48.265 --> 05:49.465
No trouble, slue.

05:49.641 --> 05:50.521
No trouble, I promise.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.135
No, it went real smooth.

05:53.645 --> 05:54.685
Black and white TV.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.572
Shit. I mean, i
thought it was color.

05:57.566 --> 06:00.526
The sign said, free
color TV in every room.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.614
What the fuck am I supposed
to watch on black and white?

06:02.612 --> 06:03.782
Dragnet?

06:04.823 --> 06:06.583
Okay, I'll take it back
to the Harmony motel.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.195
I own the fucking motel!

06:10.370 --> 06:11.250
<i>Okay.</i>

06:11.246 --> 06:12.906
I got you a Lincoln continental.

06:12.914 --> 06:13.964
You didn't own that,

06:13.957 --> 06:15.497
and I got a real nice
present for Pearl.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.917
A nice little overnight
case with...

06:18.920 --> 06:20.550
Perfumes and...

06:20.755 --> 06:21.915
Women's under apparel.

06:22.215 --> 06:26.465
My lord. Look
what weasel brought me.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.556
A beautiful little baby.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.442
Poor little baby.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.862
Aww. Can I keep him?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.570
Please. Can I?

06:41.735 --> 06:42.855
Please.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.198
Slue.

06:47.574 --> 06:48.494
You got to believe me, man.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.580
I mean, I didn't know
nothing about no baby.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.696
Sweet little toes.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.506
No trouble, slue.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.087
No trouble stealing the car.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.759
Just a pile of junk.

07:08.345 --> 07:11.505
A black and white TV
set, and a fucking kid.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.184
Well, I got an idea.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.850
First I'm gonna
fucking kill you,

07:15.852 --> 07:18.852
then I'm gonna burn the
black and white TV set,

07:18.855 --> 07:21.065
and then I'm gonna feed
the kid to the hogs.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.778
Sounds good to me!

07:22.984 --> 07:23.864
No.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.491
This is my baby.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.370
I'm not going to
let you do that.

07:32.869 --> 07:36.669
You won't? You won't let me?

07:37.749 --> 07:40.289
My my. Pearl, c'mon.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.672
Give me the baby, Pearl.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.127
I won't hurt the baby.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.175
C'mon, Pearl. You
don't deserve the baby.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.801
Give me the baby.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.349
Give me the baby.

07:55.225 --> 07:58.975
You lay one hand
on this child,

07:59.145 --> 08:02.065
slue honey, I'm leaving you.

08:09.781 --> 08:10.871
I mean it.

08:18.623 --> 08:22.673
Daddy, I knew I could trust you.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.838
It's okay, honey.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.339
<i>Okay.</i>

08:31.511 --> 08:32.851
<i>Okay.</i>

08:33.054 --> 08:35.854
You started
this family problem.

08:37.683 --> 08:38.943
<i>Flee'.!</i>

08:40.770 --> 08:41.940
Get up.

08:43.398 --> 08:46.228
Where in the hell do you
think you're going, asshole?

08:46.609 --> 08:47.689
I'm going to Harmony.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.361
The fuck you are.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.609
You've got work to
do across the border.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.196
I want Charlie p
out here tomorrow,

08:54.617 --> 08:56.867
and I want you to start walking.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.080
Walk? You want me to walk?

08:59.414 --> 09:01.794
You're lucky you're
not fucking dead.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.040
Now get moving. Now!

09:04.210 --> 09:05.840
Okay, okay, okay. I'm walking.

09:06.046 --> 09:06.916
Look.See?

09:06.921 --> 09:08.631
Walk. This is me walking.

09:09.090 --> 09:09.840
I'm walking.

09:09.841 --> 09:10.421
Now!

09:10.425 --> 09:11.925
I'm going!

09:11.926 --> 09:13.846
I'm going all the way across
the goddamn county line!

09:14.054 --> 09:15.064
I'm walking!

10:12.612 --> 10:14.702
Yummy, Sonny...

10:15.281 --> 10:17.281
Yummy, funny, Sonny.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.494
Aww, Sonny boy.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.374
Mama loves you so much.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.581
Hey Pearl!

10:22.789 --> 10:24.249
C'mon let's play catch.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.206
Yeah, right here.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.091
C'mon, baby. C'mon.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.126
C'mon, Pearl.
Throw me that baby.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.847
You fricking bitch.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.223
Get out of here!

10:39.472 --> 10:41.142
No team spirit.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.732
That fucking kid is mine.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.062
Hi Pearl!

11:21.931 --> 11:24.731
Hi slue. I hope I'm
not interrupting.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.811
That rag on your head
won't get you to the klan.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.805
I'm here on business.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.522
Shit.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.477
I heard you had a car
for me to dispose of.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.697
Shit.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.327
Where are we going, slue?

11:49.751 --> 11:51.381
Back off!

11:54.505 --> 11:56.125
Slue. Slue.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.635
My. Does it work?

12:15.526 --> 12:16.776
I like that.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.113
I really like that.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.993
It's not for sale,

12:20.990 --> 12:22.620
but she is.

12:25.662 --> 12:26.912
Tell weasel I want
it painted black.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.213
I want new plates on it,

12:28.206 --> 12:30.786
and I want it across the
state line by Friday.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.589
Right. You're the boss, slue.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.174
Slue, honey, have you
offered our guest a drink?

12:35.421 --> 12:36.961
Get off my back, Pearl.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.715
When's the last time
you offered me a drink?

12:38.925 --> 12:41.335
Why Pearl? What
have you there?

12:41.719 --> 12:45.059
I didn't know my beautiful
Pearl blossom was with child.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.101
I've been
keeping it a secret.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.063
The shame of being
an unwed mother is

12:49.060 --> 12:50.650
just too much to bear.

12:51.396 --> 12:54.146
I ought to
kill you, the kid...

12:56.526 --> 12:57.436
---A"d you!

12:57.652 --> 12:59.952
Hey slue! Slue,
c'mon, take it easy.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.623
You're missing one of
the biggest joys of life.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.365
I only meant that...

13:04.575 --> 13:07.285
I only meant that I think
you'd make a wonderful father.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.125
College boy, right.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.799
Grabs me by the lapels, right.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.336
He's acting real tough.

13:19.549 --> 13:20.839
So I grab my gun out

13:20.842 --> 13:21.932
from under where he's
not looking at me,

13:21.926 --> 13:23.636
and I pull that to
his face, I click it,

13:23.636 --> 13:25.136
and I say, okay, son of a bitch,

13:25.138 --> 13:26.348
get into the room.

13:26.556 --> 13:26.886
Move.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.928
Get! Get! Get, get,
get, get, get, get.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.142
I go into the room,
i close the door.

13:31.144 --> 13:31.894
Ban]!

13:32.103 --> 13:33.603
I get him, Sam. Right here.

13:33.813 --> 13:34.983
See? Right here.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.729
Right between the eyes.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.570
Guy thought he was tough.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.242
He was nothing.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.486
Hey, hold it down,
weasel?

13:47.452 --> 13:49.002
Well, look who's here.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.205
It's doc bender.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.588
How you doing, doc?

13:58.588 --> 14:01.628
Put anymore monkey parts
in unsuspecting patients?

14:11.976 --> 14:14.016
The doc here is famous.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.777
Slue told me that you
had your picture on the

14:19.859 --> 14:24.159
front page folks of the
goddamn New York times.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.331
But you got yourself kicked out.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.242
That's enough!

14:28.242 --> 14:29.662
Careful, doc.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.288
You don't go talking
down to one of slue's men.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.722
Slue doesn't hire men.

14:42.924 --> 14:44.384
What?

14:44.675 --> 14:46.215
What's in your pant's pocket?

14:46.594 --> 14:47.764
What?

14:47.929 --> 14:49.599
Your pistol.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.766
My goddamn pistol is
in my coat pocket, man.

14:52.975 --> 14:56.725
Me and slue own
this goddamn town.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.443
Me and slue, man,
is almost brothers.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.240
I'm his goddamn
righthand man, man.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.696
I'll be putting flowers
on your grave, doc.

15:21.546 --> 15:24.216
Now, hold hold it.
Just a minute, doc.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.680
I see no reason to tell slue

15:28.845 --> 15:31.805
about the good
doctor's indiscretion.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.810
Let me give you a
piece of advice,

15:33.808 --> 15:35.598
because I like you, doc.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.975
In Harmony, you're
allowed one mistake.

15:39.605 --> 15:40.895
Only one.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.193
Rules of citizenship?

15:45.361 --> 15:46.951
Exactly.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.087
You dumb bitch.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.666
Who do you think you are?
Mother Mary?

16:13.806 --> 16:16.426
Always, had in mind.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.770
Then someday you find,

16:20.396 --> 16:22.936
it's right there at your door,

16:23.441 --> 16:25.481
there's so much more,

16:25.485 --> 16:27.985
waiting for you.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.359
<i>I repeat,
can you read me?</i>

16:30.573 --> 16:32.533
<i>I'm going to check out Mr. slue.</i>

16:35.119 --> 16:37.329
<i>This is deputy hall. Come in.</i>

16:40.249 --> 16:41.919
<i>I need backup.</i>

16:51.594 --> 16:53.894
Madigan here. Hello.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.890
Madigan here. Hello?

17:00.895 --> 17:03.225
Now where the hell are they?

17:04.565 --> 17:07.355
Hello? Slue, can you hear me?

17:08.611 --> 17:12.741
27 TV sets, two refrigerators.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.201
Do you want me to
do make and model

17:15.201 --> 17:16.540
on all of these?

17:16.702 --> 17:18.502
And one baby boy.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.288
He's not for sale.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.250
One baby boy.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.421
Retail value 10,000 bucks.

17:26.628 --> 17:27.878
Get rid of him.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.586
Pearl! Get back here!

17:32.802 --> 17:34.142
Man has no decency.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.636
No decency whatsoever.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.268
Pearl we got company.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.773
It's that new fucking recruit.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.664
Stirred up a little
dust, didn't you?

17:54.282 --> 17:55.912
Afternoon officer.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.156
You lost your way, honey?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.832
Nope. I believe I'm
in the right place.

18:02.707 --> 18:06.127
Lordy. Somebody
must be in trouble.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.464
I'm looking for
three individuals.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.631
Must have taken
the wrong turn.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.969
They did.

18:13.134 --> 18:15.224
I'm told they took a
shortcut through Harmony.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.601
Maybe you ought to
talk to sheriff madigan.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.385
I thought I'd go
straight to the top.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.637
Are you sure you
want to do that?

18:27.690 --> 18:30.030
They were traveling with
a six month old child.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.243
How old's your baby, miss?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.025
That ain't her kid. She's
just sitting with him.

18:35.406 --> 18:38.616
Pearl. It'll be
gone by nightfall.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.291
Mind if I look around?

18:45.333 --> 18:47.963
I wouldn't dream of
interfering with the law.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.262
Pearl. Take this
boy around will you.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.632
It's inventory day.

19:09.899 --> 19:13.689
You wouldn't happen to have
a receipt for all this stuff?

19:14.236 --> 19:16.736
No, we picked it
all up in a swap meet.

19:17.073 --> 19:20.623
See, slue and me are
kind of junk collectors.

19:20.826 --> 19:24.536
I wouldn't call that
baby there junk, ma'am.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.617
Find anything yet?

19:54.151 --> 19:56.651
Now. Now, sweetheart.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.123
Drink from me, honey.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.122
Drink from your mommy.

20:01.659 --> 20:03.159
Yes, sweetheart.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.369
Yes.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.248
Stay away from my house, slue!

20:08.916 --> 20:10.326
This is my house!

20:16.215 --> 20:17.835
Get away from me, slue.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.853
You get away from this baby.

20:21.637 --> 20:22.847
Get out of here!

20:30.271 --> 20:31.811
Give me my kid.

20:33.858 --> 20:35.148
Give me that kid!

20:35.359 --> 20:36.689
Stay away from me, slue.

20:36.694 --> 20:39.034
No, please. Slue!

20:39.447 --> 20:40.487
My son.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.569
No no.

20:41.782 --> 20:42.702
My kid.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.802
<i>The
ground trembles,</i>

20:57.757 --> 21:00.007
<i>his hands hold me tight,</i>

21:01.260 --> 21:03.890
<i>a warm red liquid
covers us both.</i>

21:06.140 --> 21:08.100
<i>Now I am his.</i>

22:28.472 --> 22:29.892
Cake time.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.480
Later for the cake.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.142
Mask time.

22:43.654 --> 22:45.534
Is that little cake for me?

22:46.949 --> 22:48.449
Yes, slue honey.

22:48.659 --> 22:49.329
Thank you.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.445
I've got something
special for the kid.

22:56.917 --> 22:59.037
Make a little room.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.521
Crazy little bastard.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.902
Like father, like son.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.208
<i>Father
cut loose my tongue.</i>

23:39.585 --> 23:42.045
<i>A present for my birthday.</i>

23:42.713 --> 23:45.133
<i>The gift of silence.</i>

23:45.883 --> 23:50.013
<i>And Pearl, she put my voice in
the freezer for safekeeping.</i>

23:51.347 --> 23:53.137
<i>And then I ate sweet cake.</i>

23:54.183 --> 23:56.733
Goddamn Pearl. Look at him.

23:57.353 --> 23:58.943
He ain't even...

23:59.813 --> 24:01.573
Shedding a tear.

24:46.568 --> 24:50.278
<i>Father teaches
me games of strength and love.</i>

24:50.990 --> 24:53.280
<i>I tasted dirt from the ground,</i>

24:53.867 --> 24:56.537
<i>feel the rope across my back,</i>

24:57.705 --> 25:01.785
<i>and my mother's warm
breast holding me close.</i>

25:58.640 --> 26:01.190
<i>This game makes me stronger.</i>

26:02.102 --> 26:04.522
<i>Given me a skin of armour.</i>

26:05.105 --> 26:08.355
<i>It's so hard, that even
fire can't harm me.</i>

27:06.542 --> 27:08.042
Yes sweetheart.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.918
My slue says you're
almost a man now,

27:12.214 --> 27:16.144
so time for a grown up hair cut.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.510
Yes.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.770
Mama take good care of you.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.640
Gonna be so handsome.

27:25.936 --> 27:29.476
Yes, sweetheart. Yes.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.712
I heard some sounds
coming from over there.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.922
We hear you're experimenting
with something.

27:53.755 --> 27:57.085
It must be close
to feeding time, slue.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.560
Yeah, that's a good idea.

28:04.558 --> 28:06.688
Sonny boy, daddy's got
a surprise for you.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.817
Little bastard's hungry.

28:21.074 --> 28:23.044
Feed him a chicken.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.368
You're the boss, slue.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.519
My watch!

28:51.230 --> 28:52.690
He ate my rolex.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.737
Give it back!

28:58.362 --> 29:00.282
I want it back!

29:09.456 --> 29:12.126
I'll get even with you for this.

29:18.674 --> 29:21.014
Cop car!

29:38.777 --> 29:40.277
Slue, we got trouble.

29:40.487 --> 29:41.657
Could be big.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.043
Sure wouldn't turn
down a cold drink.

29:51.373 --> 29:53.043
What kind of trouble?

29:53.792 --> 29:56.502
It's the mayor.
He's getting greedy.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.547
Wants more than his share.

29:58.755 --> 30:01.295
Well, then send
him out

30:01.508 --> 30:02.588
well it don't look good.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.391
A town official speaking
out against you.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.354
Could give the people ideas.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.976
This town's mine,
and this land's mine,

30:10.726 --> 30:12.936
and nobody better dare
give me any trouble.

30:18.984 --> 30:22.284
By the way, the mayor's your
brother-in-law, isn't he?

30:23.405 --> 30:25.155
Yeah, he is.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.657
Shame.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.039
Why don't you just relax?

31:25.509 --> 31:27.929
Yeah, go. Go!

31:39.356 --> 31:40.646
Without slue and
his enterprises,

31:40.649 --> 31:41.819
we wouldn't have a town.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.360
But mayor, if...

31:44.653 --> 31:47.783
The town joined forces,
we'd be rid of slue.

31:48.115 --> 31:49.565
Understand.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.043
But folks seem content
to leave things as is.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.132
What the hell?

32:05.298 --> 32:06.678
Who's there?

32:53.346 --> 32:55.716
Holy shit! Who are you?

32:57.809 --> 32:58.849
C'mon, speak up!

32:59.060 --> 33:00.100
Breaking and entering
is against the law

33:00.312 --> 33:01.402
around these parts!

33:01.605 --> 33:03.265
C'mon, move it!

33:03.482 --> 33:04.272
I said move it!

33:04.483 --> 33:06.233
No dirty little son of a
bitch is gonna intimidate me!

34:49.588 --> 34:51.878
<i>Can this be me?</i>

34:53.382 --> 34:56.723
<i>This pitiful thing I see
trapped in this mirror?</i>

35:47.145 --> 35:50.105
That will teach you to
double cross me, you bastard.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.588
Bastard.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.431
That'll rot your brain.

36:19.969 --> 36:21.719
Papa's come to take you home.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.731
You did good. Real good.

36:26.810 --> 36:28.770
Now put it on.

36:29.396 --> 36:30.976
Put it on!

37:00.844 --> 37:03.514
<i>These bars
are stronger than bones.</i>

37:04.139 --> 37:05.769
<i>Colder than flesh.</i>

37:07.350 --> 37:09.770
<i>Now I have tasted
the blood of a man.</i>

37:12.147 --> 37:14.317
<i>I have pleased my father.</i>

37:22.866 --> 37:24.866
Move it, son. Go.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.474
Sounds like Jesus.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.637
You're crying now.

37:45.513 --> 37:46.813
Sweat.

37:47.974 --> 37:50.984
Smells like female
teardrops to me.

37:56.566 --> 37:58.856
Good boy. Good boy.

38:16.878 --> 38:18.298
Anybody see what happened?

38:18.505 --> 38:20.465
Looks like a
mountain lion got him.

38:21.216 --> 38:22.716
Or worse.

38:22.926 --> 38:23.716
Looks like the mayor won't be

38:23.927 --> 38:25.677
having a Christian burial.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.810
Well, that's a damn shame.

38:28.056 --> 38:29.466
It sure is.

38:29.682 --> 38:31.892
A very grave situation, sir.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.191
Well, I sure do hope our

38:34.187 --> 38:37.067
fine citizens of
Harmony walk softly.

38:37.857 --> 38:40.147
Yes, I sure do hope so.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.360
Otherwise, the
consequences are...

38:43.822 --> 38:45.202
How shall I put it?

38:46.074 --> 38:47.244
Dire.

38:48.618 --> 38:50.908
Yes, extremely dire.

38:56.376 --> 38:59.046
Enjoy.

39:00.964 --> 39:02.724
Magnificent.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.129
Now listen, don't you boys

39:04.342 --> 39:05.842
go eating everything in sight.

39:06.678 --> 39:09.058
I promised I'd bring
the leftovers to my son.

39:09.264 --> 39:10.774
Sonny boy's on a diet.

39:10.974 --> 39:12.484
Slue darling.

39:13.393 --> 39:14.603
I want him hungry.

39:14.811 --> 39:16.271
But, he hasn't...

39:16.688 --> 39:18.648
Pearl, don't cross me.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.528
The man's heartless.

39:20.775 --> 39:21.855
The boy's in training.

39:22.068 --> 39:23.278
He's earning his own money,
he's gonna be a champion.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.736
I want him mean,
lean and hungry.

39:26.823 --> 39:29.413
Pearl, this is delicious.

39:29.409 --> 39:32.449
I mean, there is nothing
like good home cooking.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.174
You bet.

39:38.543 --> 39:41.463
Boys, kid's come of age.

39:41.713 --> 39:42.843
It's time to move.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.804
Leave? Harmony?

39:46.467 --> 39:47.887
Weasel, weasel.

39:48.469 --> 39:50.889
Time has not blessed
you with wisdom.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.563
When a man reaches
a certain age,

39:53.766 --> 39:55.556
it's time for change.

39:57.020 --> 40:00.020
No more petty theft, no
more two-bit refrigerators.

40:01.024 --> 40:02.534
Fuck it. We're going
in for the big bucks.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.404
We're going into the art world.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.106
Art world?

40:06.112 --> 40:07.572
Why not?

40:07.739 --> 40:09.569
We drive across the state
line into California.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.832
We got bel air, Beverly hills.

40:12.619 --> 40:13.909
We got a kid who can eat his way

40:13.912 --> 40:15.792
right through
their golden gates,

40:15.997 --> 40:18.747
and we got this
town to protect us.

40:21.544 --> 40:25.674
Slue, we get a whole
mess of bel air shit.

40:26.090 --> 40:26.880
Yeah.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.641
What are we gonna do with it?

40:28.843 --> 40:30.553
Steal from one, and
sell it to the other.

40:30.803 --> 40:33.263
There ain't no fingerprints
on that high class shit.

40:37.226 --> 40:39.146
A class act, slue.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.611
The big time.

40:42.649 --> 40:44.319
A few practice
runs, Charlie p,

40:44.525 --> 40:46.895
and then you deal
with the sharks.

40:50.823 --> 40:53.083
I always knew I'd prosper...

40:54.285 --> 40:56.495
In the artistic community.

40:58.665 --> 41:01.035
You're truly a man
of vision, slue.

41:04.671 --> 41:05.711
A man of vision.

41:06.005 --> 41:07.415
Sonny baby.

41:08.216 --> 41:11.006
Here's your mama. Some
nice food for you.

41:14.430 --> 41:17.520
Yeah, sweetheart. Yeah.

41:17.725 --> 41:20.435
Your mommy loves you,
and you know it, don't you?

41:23.064 --> 41:24.774
Now you keep quiet.

41:26.442 --> 41:28.442
Be quiet for mommy, okay?

41:50.925 --> 41:53.005
Hey! Ice cream!

42:29.297 --> 42:30.967
Hi.

42:33.468 --> 42:35.138
You scared me.

42:37.305 --> 42:41.055
I wanted an ice cream.

42:43.061 --> 42:45.611
What are you doing in here?

42:55.615 --> 42:57.405
What's your name?

43:02.288 --> 43:03.788
Yeah.

43:05.666 --> 43:07.876
Fuck it. Bye.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.790
Hate it here.

43:48.793 --> 43:50.093
Don't you?

43:52.964 --> 43:55.884
You know, I'm gonna get
out of here one day.

43:58.136 --> 43:59.546
Go to la.

44:01.889 --> 44:03.349
Somewhere.

44:11.399 --> 44:12.979
My name's rose.

44:16.195 --> 44:17.735
What's yours?

44:23.077 --> 44:25.907
Fine. Forget it.

45:13.336 --> 45:16.166
This fucking suburbia
gives me the creeps.

45:16.380 --> 45:18.420
You got no
taste. Look at that.

45:34.482 --> 45:35.482
Can I watch, slue?

45:35.691 --> 45:37.071
You know the kid works solo.

45:37.276 --> 45:39.236
Yeah, well one can only
hope he's neat and tidy

45:39.237 --> 45:40.857
about this experiment.

45:41.155 --> 45:43.195
I do have a squeamish stomach.

45:48.204 --> 45:49.584
Come on let's go. Come on.

45:55.378 --> 45:56.378
Afternoon.

45:57.255 --> 46:00.045
Real nice church
you got there, father.

46:00.883 --> 46:01.763
Thank you.

46:02.843 --> 46:04.433
You're welcome to come in.

46:04.887 --> 46:06.717
We're here on business.

46:06.722 --> 46:07.972
No time for praying.

46:08.182 --> 46:10.522
Well,
I'll be in the rectory,

46:10.977 --> 46:12.647
in case you change your mind.

46:22.280 --> 46:26.660
Father, son, holy
ghost.

46:28.494 --> 46:30.584
We're here on business.

46:43.509 --> 46:45.889
My enemy's inside, boy.

46:46.846 --> 46:48.636
This is what I want you to do.

46:55.313 --> 46:57.063
Don't give me any back talk.

46:57.565 --> 46:59.315
You're my son.

47:01.319 --> 47:02.449
Do it.

48:40.626 --> 48:43.416
What
are you doing up there?

48:44.797 --> 48:46.667
Come down, boy. Come on.

48:54.765 --> 48:56.175
Who did that to you?

49:01.856 --> 49:02.896
Stop it!

49:05.443 --> 49:06.823
Give it to me.

49:08.154 --> 49:09.244
Let go.

49:09.613 --> 49:10.703
<i>Drop 'm.!</i>

49:20.749 --> 49:22.669
You think he's
right in the head?

49:23.461 --> 49:24.211
Who?

49:24.378 --> 49:25.588
Sonny boy.

49:27.047 --> 49:29.467
What in the fuck
is wrong with you?

49:29.675 --> 49:31.085
Haven't you heard, slue?

49:31.510 --> 49:34.310
Our weasel's taking
to reading books now.

49:34.847 --> 49:36.427
Well, I figured I ought to,

49:36.640 --> 49:38.270
since we're all
artists now, you know?

49:38.476 --> 49:40.516
What's an art book
got to do with my kid?

49:40.728 --> 49:42.898
Well, lots of 'em
was off in their heads,

49:43.105 --> 49:44.725
and one of 'em even
chopped his ear off,

49:44.732 --> 49:46.232
so I figured that maybe Sonny-

49:47.276 --> 49:49.446
Sonny boy's my kid.

49:49.737 --> 49:51.697
I made him what he is,

49:52.656 --> 49:56.076
and he ain't no fuckin' painter.

50:09.173 --> 50:10.723
Good show.

50:12.927 --> 50:15.597
You did real good, son.

50:17.723 --> 50:19.393
Put it on.

50:38.285 --> 50:40.745
<i>There's
something flowing in me now.</i>

50:42.248 --> 50:44.418
<i>A taste I've never had.</i>

50:45.876 --> 50:47.746
<i>The blood of a good man.</i>

50:49.338 --> 50:52.258
You know, I heard one of
the prospectors in Harmony

50:52.508 --> 50:54.758
stumbled across
some gold nuggets.

50:55.469 --> 50:57.349
Now I was thinking
of that boy of yours.

50:57.721 --> 50:59.181
It's my fucking town.

50:59.348 --> 51:00.718
We leave the people alone.

51:01.642 --> 51:03.732
I'm talking about a hermit.

51:03.894 --> 51:06.984
Some lonely old prospector
nobody will ever miss.

51:07.147 --> 51:09.477
Why, Sonny boy could
have him for dessert.

51:09.483 --> 51:11.403
Boy's got a good
appetite, slue.

51:11.610 --> 51:13.400
I got this whole
town under my thumb.

51:13.946 --> 51:15.356
One mysterious
killing, and you'll see

51:15.573 --> 51:17.033
how nervous they get.

51:18.951 --> 51:21.161
Old age is making
you cautious.

51:21.370 --> 51:23.500
You're the boss, slue.

51:46.312 --> 51:48.272
I don't think this
is such a good idea.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.400
Hey. Weasel, wait a minute.

51:50.608 --> 51:51.858
Wait a minute.

51:52.860 --> 51:54.240
You've lost it.

51:54.903 --> 51:56.533
Your joie de vivre.

51:56.739 --> 51:57.909
Adventure.

51:58.115 --> 52:00.445
I never crossed slue before.

52:00.659 --> 52:02.199
<i>- You're not.
- Shhh!</i>

52:03.746 --> 52:06.866
Look, we're simply going
to borrow the creature.

52:07.082 --> 52:08.212
That's all.

52:08.459 --> 52:11.499
Anyway, he wants some airing.

52:11.962 --> 52:13.802
Don't you, my little pet?

52:15.966 --> 52:17.586
Shhh!

52:17.801 --> 52:19.761
<i>This isn't right.</i>

52:20.137 --> 52:22.847
<i>Why have they come for
me when father is away?</i>

52:31.398 --> 52:33.358
<i>My chest burns.</i>

52:34.109 --> 52:36.069
<i>Too many thoughts fill my head.</i>

52:38.364 --> 52:40.124
<i>I don't now what's
right anymore.</i>

53:22.866 --> 53:24.276
Good
boy, Sonny boy.

53:24.493 --> 53:26.253
Now give me the gold, Sonny boy.

53:26.453 --> 53:28.043
Drop the gold, Sonny boy.

53:28.247 --> 53:29.037
Give me the gold.

53:29.415 --> 53:31.205
C'mon. Give me the gold.

53:31.417 --> 53:34.377
Gimme that.
Goddamnit, Charlie p.

53:35.629 --> 53:36.839
He needs an
attitude adjustment.

53:37.005 --> 53:38.205
That's what he needs.

53:38.215 --> 53:40.375
- He just wants to play.
- I've played with him.

53:40.718 --> 53:41.388
C'mon.

53:41.552 --> 53:42.722
Show him. Show him.

53:43.137 --> 53:44.137
He's tough.
C'mon. C'mon.

53:44.430 --> 53:45.100
Show him, baby.

53:45.305 --> 53:46.515
That's it. C'mon.

53:49.101 --> 53:49.981
C'mon babe.

53:50.352 --> 53:51.732
I'm gonna get you this time.

53:51.729 --> 53:52.729
Right here.

54:01.864 --> 54:02.744
Goddamn!

54:02.948 --> 54:03.818
Charlie.

54:04.032 --> 54:04.952
Charlie p., look at that, man.

54:05.159 --> 54:06.539
He got my goddamn thumb!

54:06.744 --> 54:08.754
Shit boy, you got
a set of choppers!

54:09.204 --> 54:12.374
Goddamn boy! Look at that!

54:12.666 --> 54:15.246
Got my goddamn thumb, boy!

54:15.836 --> 54:17.626
Shit!

54:18.172 --> 54:20.422
Let's just call him, it, okay?

54:20.632 --> 54:22.892
It grabs my thumb, man,

54:23.135 --> 54:24.295
and bam.

54:24.470 --> 54:26.760
Takes it off, just clean
as a goddamn whistle.

54:26.972 --> 54:28.602
Just like that, boys.

54:29.141 --> 54:30.771
You outta let
me have a look at that?

54:30.976 --> 54:34.096
What? Let you put
a monkey dick on it?

54:37.191 --> 54:38.651
Your funeral.

54:39.151 --> 54:40.361
I don't think I'm
gonna be the one

54:40.569 --> 54:42.359
having the funeral, doc.

54:42.780 --> 54:46.740
Sounds to me, there was just
a little bit of screaming

54:46.742 --> 54:48.292
out on the edge of Harmony.

54:48.535 --> 54:51.575
Almost like somebody
getting themselves killed.

54:52.915 --> 54:55.035
You should call
your friend, the sheriff.

54:55.834 --> 54:57.134
Why tell us?

55:02.174 --> 55:03.764
You think it will
make your dick longer?

55:11.141 --> 55:12.641
Drinks are on me.

55:18.315 --> 55:20.565
Since when do you
pan for gold?

55:21.652 --> 55:24.152
Since this evening.

55:25.322 --> 55:26.412
That's right.

55:26.615 --> 55:29.485
We took slue's secret weapon
out for a little gold hunting.

55:29.701 --> 55:31.701
Secret weapon my ass.

55:32.746 --> 55:35.706
A real woman should
be seen and not heard.

55:38.168 --> 55:39.418
What did you do?

55:39.628 --> 55:41.418
Hold up some tourists?

55:41.630 --> 55:43.010
What's new about that?

55:43.298 --> 55:45.758
Lady, we don't need a rifle.

55:45.759 --> 55:48.259
Yeah! Guns are passé.

55:49.096 --> 55:50.256
That's right.

55:50.430 --> 55:53.350
From now on we use the
secret weapon.

55:58.355 --> 55:59.725
I'll tell you one thing.

56:00.190 --> 56:03.610
He ain't no goddamn
vegetarian.

56:22.880 --> 56:25.630
<i>Their eyes
pierced deep into me.</i>

56:27.467 --> 56:28.967
<i>Hurting me.</i>

56:35.893 --> 56:38.563
<i>Am I that different from all of them?</i>

56:46.028 --> 56:47.358
Slue's a professional.

56:47.571 --> 56:49.531
He wouldn't turn
on his own people.

56:49.907 --> 56:51.327
If you say so.

57:22.731 --> 57:24.651
What the fuck?

57:26.026 --> 57:27.986
Get up you little shit.

57:37.204 --> 57:38.584
Where did you get
that souvenir, boy?

57:38.789 --> 57:39.459
Where?

57:39.873 --> 57:41.833
Did it belong to holy man?

57:42.626 --> 57:44.206
I asked you a question!

57:45.045 --> 57:46.625
Whose is it?

57:46.838 --> 57:49.508
Slue honey, you know
my baby can't talk.

57:49.967 --> 57:53.967
See this? He's been outside.

57:55.973 --> 57:57.393
Sweetheart, he's at that age.

57:57.766 --> 57:59.136
You can't expect
to keep a young man

57:59.351 --> 58:00.941
cooped up all the time...

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:58.107
Hey!

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:03.199
What are you looking
at, you fucking pervert?

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.796
Get my clothes!

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:41.741
Let's get the fucker!

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:39.918
Hold on to
your socks, shit face!

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:48.655
Sonny boy.

01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:51.704
Leave her the fuck alone.

01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:45.045
Somebody cut his tongue out.

01:04:45.256 --> 01:04:46.296
You know that, don't you?

01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:49.338
Well, maybe he did it eating
some glass or something.

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:52.432
It's obvious he doesn't
take good care of himself.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:53.849
Leave it alone, Max.

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:55.517
You know this one's
out of all our hands.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:56.845
You finished yet?

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:58.192
You just patch him up.

01:04:58.395 --> 01:04:59.765
I'll notify slue.

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:02.227
I'll let myself
out the back way.

01:05:17.956 --> 01:05:21.286
You don't understand a
word I'm saying, do you?

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:32.845
Shut up, Pearl. Here.

01:05:36.391 --> 01:05:38.021
Why did he run away?

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:40.772
We gave him so much.

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:45.942
I just don't
understand children.

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:49.402
Maybe we ought to
steal the kid away.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:53.578
Whatever you say, sweetheart.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.700
As long as my baby
comes back to me.

01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:01.674
Who cut your tongue out?

01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:05.341
Can you read? Write?

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:14.932
They want your blood.

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:24.653
<i>We want
action! Give him to us!</i>

01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:33.026
We want action!

01:07:03.478 --> 01:07:05.268
He's in no
condition to be moved.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.572
Get out of my way.

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:35.343
Who's there?

01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:38.972
Hey you!

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.470
Get the hell out of
here, you son of a bitch!

01:07:59.617 --> 01:08:00.617
Go on, you bastard!

01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:02.117
Get out of here!

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:59.777
What do you want?

01:10:04.117 --> 01:10:06.737
Hey, you thirsty?

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:08.623
Here.

01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:13.499
Here, have some.

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:30.138
Good.

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:32.524
Want more?

01:10:33.604 --> 01:10:35.364
Here.

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:44.527
It's good.

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:32.584
Cookies?

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.170
You like cookies?

01:11:41.464 --> 01:11:42.844
Sugar?

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:45.335
Sugar's good.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.602
Having a good time?

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:59.018
Yeah, me too.

01:11:59.774 --> 01:12:01.614
I like tea time.

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:04.318
Company dropping in on me.

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:07.160
It's nice. Cozy.

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:18.583
That's nice.

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:22.383
You don't want to
give this to me.

01:12:23.631 --> 01:12:25.381
Give me that.

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:28.010
Now, take it easy.

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:33.977
That's right, boy.

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.563
That's a good boy.

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:37.978
C'mon. Give it to me.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:39.648
Give it to me.

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:41.186
Good boy.

01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:46.901
You son of a bitch.

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.520
There he is.

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:34.798
Slue, the town's up in arms!

01:14:35.346 --> 01:14:38.846
Weasel and I will attempt
to save the child!

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:42.975
Whose side are we on?

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:44.807
Whoever wins, my friend.

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:09.883
<i>How much pain can I stand?</i>

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:19.885
<i>How much hate?</i>

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:22.059
<i>They should leave me alone.</i>

01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:20.155
Sheriff! There's a monster.

01:16:20.367 --> 01:16:23.407
It's a blood bath! Do something!

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:28.286
You're the monsters.

01:16:29.627 --> 01:16:31.547
You let it happen.

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:34.262
Now you good people
are gonna have

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:35.666
to pay the price.

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:21.068
Not so hard, dummy.

01:18:29.955 --> 01:18:31.115
Come here.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:34.455
It's like this.

01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:51.096
See?

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:52.900
<i>Okay.</i>

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:55.733
Go ahead.

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:57.523
Bite.

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:11.160
You're slow.

01:19:31.558 --> 01:19:33.888
You don't know nothing, do you?

01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:39.725
You know, you never talk to me.

01:19:40.901 --> 01:19:42.361
Why?

01:19:47.574 --> 01:19:51.204
What? Are you shy?

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:55.916
That's okay.

01:19:56.917 --> 01:20:00.337
You know, I get like
that sometimes too.

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:02.797
Believe it or not.

01:20:10.723 --> 01:20:12.473
You like me, don't you?

01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:18.479
You're shaking.

01:20:20.524 --> 01:20:22.154
Scary?

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:28.200
That's because...

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:47.051
Get up!

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:48.589
Shit.

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:50.802
Listen you, I raised
you like I was raised

01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:52.223
and what have I got?

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:54.311
A wild fucking pervert!

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:56.726
Come on you shit.

01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:02.441
Ding. Ding ding cling.

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:04.150
No water.

01:21:05.736 --> 01:21:06.566
Ding.

01:21:10.783 --> 01:21:11.873
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:21:12.076 --> 01:21:14.366
It's time to
sober up, my friend.

01:21:14.745 --> 01:21:17.705
The good people of Harmony
want their sheriff.

01:21:19.416 --> 01:21:21.166
Folks sure do
love you, sheriff.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:22.627
They sure do.

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:26.589
Here we go. Yes sir.

01:21:43.857 --> 01:21:45.437
Hey you fat pig.

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:47.740
How about
some police protection?

01:21:47.945 --> 01:21:49.105
Yeah!

01:21:49.488 --> 01:21:50.568
Protection from what?

01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:51.701
Now come on folks!

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:52.987
Just take it easy!

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:54.580
He's got some monster hidden.

01:21:54.785 --> 01:21:56.495
He wants us to take it easy?

01:21:56.829 --> 01:21:58.119
There ain't no monster.

01:21:58.372 --> 01:22:00.122
I say we can't
wait any longer.

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:02.422
I say we hunt that thing
down and kill it tonight.

01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:03.456
What do you say?

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:06.263
I say you're
a dumbass, Sandy.

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:08.013
Get away from me.

01:22:08.215 --> 01:22:10.215
Look. He's just scared.

01:22:10.384 --> 01:22:11.644
Shut up, rose.

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:14.564
You're not man enough
to do the job, sheriff.

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.473
Stop, will you? Wait a minute.

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:19.442
You can't do this. This isn't
some animal you're hunting.

01:22:19.643 --> 01:22:21.313
It's a human being!

01:22:21.728 --> 01:22:22.768
Go home, doc!

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:26.072
Stick to your
clogs and cats, doc.

01:22:28.986 --> 01:22:31.776
You don't give a
damn about Harmony.

01:22:32.322 --> 01:22:33.412
Am I right?

01:22:34.533 --> 01:22:37.453
Yeah, and I'm gonna
help ya find...

01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:39.500
The monster.

01:22:39.705 --> 01:22:40.455
He's lying.

01:22:40.664 --> 01:22:42.544
I'm not lying! Look!

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:44.080
See that?

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:46.753
I'll tell you everything
you want to know about him!

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:49.510
'Cause I know it.

01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:53.426
I mean I knew him when he
was like a little baby.

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:54.505
Okay?

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:57.854
I watched him grow up!

01:22:58.932 --> 01:23:00.182
And become a man!

01:24:12.297 --> 01:24:14.377
Get up,
you son of a bitch.

01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:15.881
Get up!

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:17.644
Get up. Get up.

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:20.306
You almost got your father
in a shit load of trouble.

01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:22.639
What do you think I'm
running here? A stud farm?

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:25.810
You can't say Pearl and
i didn't raise you well.

01:24:27.938 --> 01:24:29.818
Shit. C'mon boy,
the cops coming.

01:24:32.192 --> 01:24:33.282
Come with me. Come on.

01:24:33.485 --> 01:24:34.145
Come on boy.

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:22.030
Okay, let's go get him!

01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:16.711
Get out of here! Get out!

01:27:22.779 --> 01:27:23.659
Come on let's get the...

01:27:23.864 --> 01:27:24.744
Where is it?

01:27:24.948 --> 01:27:25.818
It's in the pyramid. Let's go.

01:27:26.032 --> 01:27:27.782
Come on, Sonny. Come on.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.390
Come on, get in here!

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.730
Pearl!

01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:12.794
<i>Wait a minute.
The boy's still in there.</i>

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.540
Slue's got the canon.

01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:17.670
Howitzer!

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:19.710
Yeah, right. Howitzer.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:21.710
Anyway, what we're gonna do is,

01:28:21.922 --> 01:28:24.472
you guys are gonna sneak
in there in dirt bikes,

01:28:24.466 --> 01:28:26.336
and just burn the
whole thing down.

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:27.380
What do you say?

01:28:28.094 --> 01:28:29.644
No!

01:28:35.352 --> 01:28:37.352
Let me go! Goddamnit!

01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:39.152
It'd be a real tradegy

01:28:39.356 --> 01:28:40.766
if that house were to burn

01:28:40.774 --> 01:28:43.114
without saving
some of it's...

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.700
Furnishings.

01:28:49.616 --> 01:28:50.736
You're crazy.

01:28:56.206 --> 01:28:58.326
C'mon! Let's go!

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:12.319
I was always a bit
too fond of trinkets.

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:32.262
Fire!

01:30:32.469 --> 01:30:34.799
Slue, they're trying to burn us out!

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:36.773
We're all gonna burn to death!

01:30:37.057 --> 01:30:39.097
Sweet Jesus, i
don't want to die.

01:30:39.851 --> 01:30:42.561
Please god, don't
let me die in here.

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:44.148
Don't let me die.

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.200
Get down, son. Get down.

01:30:50.403 --> 01:30:51.283
Slue.

01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:53.238
Get your act together! C'mon!

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:55.868
Goddamnit, you son of a bitch!

01:30:56.242 --> 01:30:58.242
You never could hit for shit!

01:30:58.453 --> 01:30:59.793
Now guard the front door!

01:30:59.996 --> 01:31:01.456
I'll get the flames.

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:20.927
Sonny.

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:22.851
Sonny.

01:31:24.437 --> 01:31:26.187
Yes, mama will take care of you.

01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:27.691
I won't let them hurt you.

01:31:28.108 --> 01:31:30.318
Sonny, we got to get
out of here. Gone crazy.

01:31:30.902 --> 01:31:32.322
We're gonna die in here. C'mon.

01:31:32.779 --> 01:31:34.159
C'mon Sonny.

01:31:34.406 --> 01:31:35.946
Sonny, we gotta get out of here!

01:31:36.449 --> 01:31:37.779
We gotta get out!

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:49.172
Pearl!

01:32:47.395 --> 01:32:49.555
Where are they?

01:32:53.276 --> 01:32:54.436
They're gone.

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:56.740
Gone?

01:33:56.714 --> 01:33:59.474
Max, not even a hint?

01:34:06.391 --> 01:34:08.691
I'm out of practice.

01:34:15.275 --> 01:34:17.025
Willing to go for it?

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:22.454
Okay, and now all
we need is a monkey.

01:34:29.539 --> 01:34:31.749
Well, kid, good
luck to both of us.

01:34:48.391 --> 01:34:50.601
Head back. That's it.

01:34:54.147 --> 01:34:55.767
Sonny...

01:34:56.733 --> 01:34:59.863
You can make it in
life without a voice.

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:03.279
I want to make that clear.

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:07.235
I mean, it's easier with one,

01:35:07.410 --> 01:35:10.410
but, it's not
absolutely necessary.

01:35:12.957 --> 01:35:14.417
So...

01:35:16.502 --> 01:35:18.552
Ope", open.

01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:22.842
So whatever happens...

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.644
Well, we've tried our best.

01:36:07.553 --> 01:36:08.603
Easy son.

01:36:08.805 --> 01:36:09.885
Over here. Over here.

01:36:09.889 --> 01:36:10.929
Max!

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:13.229
Sonny.

01:36:13.851 --> 01:36:14.601
Easy son.

01:36:14.811 --> 01:36:15.771
C'mon Sonny.

01:36:15.979 --> 01:36:17.519
Easy. Easy, easy.

01:36:17.730 --> 01:36:18.690
Okay, okay, c'mon.

01:36:18.898 --> 01:36:20.528
C'mon. Sonny.

01:36:20.775 --> 01:36:22.145
C'mon. Easy.

01:36:22.151 --> 01:36:22.901
Take it easy.

01:36:22.902 --> 01:36:24.152
Sonny, take it easy.

01:36:24.487 --> 01:36:25.277
Sonny, take it easy.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.570
Try it again.

01:36:45.508 --> 01:36:47.178
No.

01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:02.820
No.

01:37:26.883 --> 01:37:29.343
Here's to Max bender.

01:37:31.387 --> 01:37:33.307
Couldn't leave
well enough alone.

01:37:33.306 --> 01:37:35.016
Lighten up, will you?

01:37:35.558 --> 01:37:37.518
This is supposed to
be a celebration.

01:37:37.977 --> 01:37:39.147
Him or me?

01:37:39.354 --> 01:37:41.484
Operation's a success.

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:44.229
It is? I'm still a drunk.

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:49.155
And he's...

01:37:54.077 --> 01:37:55.287
Mentally, that kids-

01:37:55.495 --> 01:37:57.575
everybody's crazy, Max.

01:37:57.914 --> 01:37:59.714
His just shows more.

01:38:03.961 --> 01:38:07.421
Haven't I got us a case
in the post operative blues.

01:38:12.011 --> 01:38:16.681
I'll run some tests on him,
and keep him under wraps.

01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:57.620
<i>I have words now,</i>

01:39:58.451 --> 01:40:00.791
<i>but what good are they?</i>

01:40:02.246 --> 01:40:03.916
<i>The pain doesn't stop,</i>

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:06.746
<i>and I wonder...</i>

01:40:09.462 --> 01:40:11.092
<i>Who am I now?</i>
