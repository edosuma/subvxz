WEBVTT

00:04.830 --> 00:07.007
Morning, captain.
Agent Lisbon.

00:07.094 --> 00:09.574
Jane, consultant.
What do we have here?

00:09.661 --> 00:11.968
Thanks for stepping in.
Homicide Unit owes you one.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.579
Jane.

00:14.666 --> 00:16.929
- You're that psychic fella.
- Right.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.889
Me? I don't
buy into that ESP crap.

00:19.976 --> 00:22.326
- No offense.
- None taken.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.894
Here we have
Ivor Rassmussen, age 34.

00:24.981 --> 00:27.940
Address, River Park.
No sign of the murder weapon.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.159
Store security was
on the scene pretty fast.

00:29.246 --> 00:30.291
We were able
to detain everybody

00:30.378 --> 00:31.988
who was in
the section at the time.

00:32.075 --> 00:34.425
We're holding them over
in the furniture department.

00:38.212 --> 00:41.389
So, Carnac,
what does Ivor say?

00:41.476 --> 00:45.045
- He tell you who done it?
- Huh.

00:47.786 --> 00:50.224
Leather pants, musky cologne,
phallic jewelry.

00:50.311 --> 00:51.877
A ladies' man.

00:51.964 --> 00:54.358
Went after high-end cougars
with moderate success.

00:54.445 --> 00:57.405
Casual cocaine user.
Plays guitar, not well.

00:57.492 --> 01:00.103
Works in the noncreative end
of a creative business.

01:00.190 --> 01:03.541
Advertising, maybe nothing worth
killing anyone over anyway.

01:03.628 --> 01:05.239
So he died
for romantic reasons.

01:05.326 --> 01:07.328
Where are those suspects
you mentioned?

01:07.415 --> 01:09.373
- The witnesses?
- Whatever.

01:10.983 --> 01:13.073
Take it down a notch.
Take it down three notches.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.770
Okay. Under control.

01:14.857 --> 01:16.598
We'll get this done quick
and be on our way.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.643
Hello.
We're from the CBI.

01:18.730 --> 01:21.646
'It may well be that
one of you is the murderer.'

01:21.733 --> 01:25.128
If that's so,
I'm gonna find out who.

01:30.481 --> 01:32.396
These two are innocent.
They can go.

01:32.483 --> 01:35.269
Uh, stick around.
We're gonna need a statement.

01:35.356 --> 01:37.532
Neil.

01:37.619 --> 01:39.186
What's the worst mistake
you've ever made? Quick.

01:39.273 --> 01:40.970
Uh, first marriage.

01:41.057 --> 01:43.233
Good answer.
Why so nervous?

01:43.320 --> 01:45.844
I'm not. I just, I..

01:45.931 --> 01:47.498
You. Your name?

01:47.585 --> 01:49.457
- Candice.
- Candice.

01:49.544 --> 01:51.937
I like that name.

01:52.024 --> 01:53.156
Oh.

01:54.984 --> 01:57.378
Here. Thank you.

01:57.465 --> 02:00.250
- Hey!
- It's okay. I'm a consultant.

02:01.991 --> 02:04.124
'Candice, take my advice.
Forgive your mother.'

02:04.211 --> 02:07.257
- Maybe the headaches will stop.
- I love my mother.

02:07.344 --> 02:10.042
Oh, I'm wrong.
Ignore my advice.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.523
- You. Your name.
- Reed.

02:12.610 --> 02:15.439
Excuse me.
This is a joke, right?

02:15.526 --> 02:17.963
A joke?
A man has been killed here.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.835
Is that funny to you?

02:19.922 --> 02:21.532
- Are you amused?
- No, but--

02:21.619 --> 02:23.186
Then, sit.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.364
Reed, quick question.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.758
Green Lantern versus Thor.
Who wins?

02:29.845 --> 02:31.934
- Thor.
- Oh, yeah.

02:32.021 --> 02:34.284
- Why'd you kill Rassmussen?
- I didn't.

02:34.371 --> 02:36.765
Alright.

02:36.852 --> 02:39.071
Now, you, Miss Grumpy
And Entitled. What's your story?

02:39.159 --> 02:41.987
My name is Mandy Schultz.
And I'll have you know that my--

02:42.074 --> 02:44.468
Let me guess. Your husband
is a very important person.

02:44.555 --> 02:47.297
He is, as it happens.

02:47.384 --> 02:48.690
John's on
the Modesto City Council.

02:48.777 --> 02:50.039
Ah.

02:50.126 --> 02:51.736
And this is
totally unprofessional

02:51.823 --> 02:53.999
and disrespectful.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.740
I'll have my husband take this
up with your superiors.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.307
Mandy, Mandy, Mandy.

02:57.394 --> 02:59.004
The diet pills
are messing with your mind.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.006
This is Sacramento,
the big city.

03:01.093 --> 03:02.356
Your husband means nothing here.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.053
Okay, that's enough.
Agent Lisbon?

03:04.140 --> 03:06.098
- Give him another moment.
- We don't need a moment.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.883
Case is all but closed.

03:07.970 --> 03:10.102
Mandy here is gonna lead us
right to the murder weapon.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.408
- What?
- Take my hands.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.454
I need physical contact
to read your mind.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.456
- You're nuts.
- Prove it.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.153
If I'm wrong, if we
can't find the murder weapon

03:17.240 --> 03:19.634
then I look like an idiot.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.552
Yes, you will.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.817
- What are you--
- Don't speak.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.703
[instrumental music]

04:19.520 --> 04:21.043
Voila!

04:21.130 --> 04:22.653
'The murder weapon.'

04:22.740 --> 04:25.830
This is crazy.
I had no idea that was there.

04:25.917 --> 04:28.006
How could you direct us right to
it if you didn't put it there?

04:28.093 --> 04:31.053
I didn't.
I-I don't know.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.142
But I-I didn't kill that man.
I-I didn't!

04:33.229 --> 04:34.535
She's right. She has nothing
to do with the murder.

04:34.622 --> 04:35.579
What?

04:35.666 --> 04:37.015
I just used her as a decoy

04:37.102 --> 04:38.495
to lull the real killer
into giving me

04:38.582 --> 04:40.628
clean directional cues.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.630
Oh, come on. What are
you talking about now?

04:42.717 --> 04:45.067
Whatever way he didn't want us
to go is the way that we went.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.111
- Therealkiller.
- Yeah.

04:46.198 --> 04:47.939
You wanna guess who it is?

04:48.026 --> 04:49.332
Come on, Jane.

04:51.465 --> 04:54.206
- Neil.
- Hey! Whoa!

04:54.294 --> 04:56.121
Excuse me.
No, I...wasn't.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.210
- I-I don't even know that man.
- Oh, is that right?

04:58.298 --> 04:59.603
I'm guessing that
he was having an affair

04:59.690 --> 05:01.213
with your current wife.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.172
You found out and you
forgave her like a sucker.

05:03.259 --> 05:05.653
He saw you here,
probably smirked

05:05.740 --> 05:10.571
and said something very clever,
made you feel...small.

05:10.658 --> 05:13.051
- Grab him!
- Humiliated you!

05:17.055 --> 05:18.840
Get him! Get him!

05:18.927 --> 05:21.886
Stop! Stop! Uhh!

05:21.973 --> 05:23.671
- Nice work.
- What?

05:23.758 --> 05:25.455
- Case is closed, isn't it?
- 'Hey! Put it down!'

05:25.542 --> 05:26.500
[gunshot]

05:26.587 --> 05:27.979
[woman screams]

05:28.066 --> 05:29.416
[male #1]
'I said drop it now!'

05:29.503 --> 05:30.634
[gunshots]

05:32.767 --> 05:35.335
[theme music]

05:49.044 --> 05:52.700
A dead suspect, quarter million
dollars worth of damages

05:52.787 --> 05:55.703
formal complaints
of misconduct from the SPD

05:55.790 --> 05:57.182
and the Modesto City Council.

05:57.269 --> 05:59.054
Those damages were way padded.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.709
All due respect, Virgil,
I was trying to close the case.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.406
It was my feeling that Red John

06:03.493 --> 06:04.755
should be our priority
given the dozen fresh leads--

06:04.842 --> 06:07.845
Stop. Stop!

06:07.932 --> 06:10.457
That's the nub of the
problem right there, Red John.

06:10.544 --> 06:13.982
Ever since the Tanner incident,
you've been runnin' way too hot.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.810
I fear a terminal screw-up
is coming.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.899
That's not gonna happen.

06:17.986 --> 06:20.858
- I can handle him.
- Canyou?

06:20.945 --> 06:23.383
Maybe since he saved your life,
you're going easy on him.

06:23.470 --> 06:26.690
Maybe you feel compelled
to cut him some slack.

06:26.777 --> 06:28.126
- Mm.
- No, sir.

06:28.213 --> 06:30.390
That is
absolutely not the case.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.870
Hey, Sam, get in here.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.181
- Lisbon.
- Bosco.

06:39.268 --> 06:42.010
Agent Bosco and his unit are
taking over the Red John case.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.925
What? No, no, no.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.579
You have always been
too close to the case

06:45.666 --> 06:48.364
and now both of you
are waytoo close.

06:48.451 --> 06:50.540
- We need to make a change.
- Can we talk about this?

06:50.627 --> 06:53.151
No. You've worked
for Agent Bosco.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.197
'You know that he will do
the job right.'

06:55.284 --> 06:57.068
You need to let my team
finish what they started.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.940
Teresa, no offense

06:59.027 --> 07:01.856
but you guys aren't even close
to catching this guy.

07:01.943 --> 07:04.728
Fresh set of eyes
gotta be a good idea.

07:04.815 --> 07:07.339
What do you know
about the case?

07:07.427 --> 07:09.864
Not much.
He's a serial killer.

07:09.951 --> 07:12.693
Fifteen victims,
including your wife and child.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.870
I can imagine your pain.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.872
Maybe that pain
is clouding your judgment.

07:22.485 --> 07:23.617
Wow.

07:30.841 --> 07:33.714
And me, Sam?
What's clouding myjudgment?

07:33.801 --> 07:36.194
Good question.
You tell me.

07:49.904 --> 07:52.080
What happened?

07:52.167 --> 07:53.560
- We're off Red John.
- What? Forever?

07:53.647 --> 07:55.344
- He can't do that.
- That's not right.

07:55.431 --> 07:57.172
Quiet.

07:57.259 --> 07:58.608
Look, this is my fault

07:58.695 --> 08:00.828
but it's a wake-up call
for all of us.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.830
We've grown slack
and unprofessional.

08:02.917 --> 08:05.746
Look, we need to earn back
the trust that we've lost.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.313
From now on,
we work 100% straight.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.751
No more shortcuts. No more ga..

08:12.448 --> 08:15.233
What are you doing?

08:15.320 --> 08:16.844
You're leaving?

08:20.151 --> 08:21.544
Well, frankly,
if I can't use this job

08:21.631 --> 08:23.372
to seek some kind of
personal revenge

08:23.459 --> 08:27.071
then, uh, there's not
a whole lot hereforme.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.641
I-I..

08:31.728 --> 08:33.251
I don't make anything better.

08:33.338 --> 08:35.210
I can't bring
dead people back to life.

08:35.297 --> 08:36.864
What good do we do?

08:36.951 --> 08:41.172
We drive around California
visiting unhappy people.

08:41.259 --> 08:43.218
We're fighting
evil and injustice.

08:43.305 --> 08:46.047
And how's that going?
Any progress lately?

08:46.134 --> 08:48.092
We put bad guys away
where they can't hurt people.

08:48.179 --> 08:49.485
That's good enough.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.443
I was doing more good
as a psychic.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.968
I was giving people hope,
at least.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.448
False hope, but hope anyway.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.233
You're right. Best you leave.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.714
That way you can go back
to being a full-time fraud

09:00.801 --> 09:03.151
and we can continue
our useless jobs in peace.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.587
Well, that's actually not
what I said.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.763
- Yes, it was.
- We're up. Twenty Palms.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.460
Let's go.
You come, too, Van Pelt.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.767
We'll take two vehicles
in case we need to split up.

09:19.515 --> 09:21.865
[Cho]
I'll see you
when you get there.

09:31.701 --> 09:35.096
Boss, no disrespect,
but I think we need Jane.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.619
We'll manage.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.447
Maybe we don't
close as many cases

09:38.534 --> 09:40.754
but the ones we
doclose will be closed right

09:40.841 --> 09:43.017
by professionals.

09:43.104 --> 09:45.367
[clicking]

09:45.454 --> 09:47.369
Van Pelt,
it's not a jet plane.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.458
Okay, okay, okay.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.025
[siren wails]

09:51.112 --> 09:52.156
S-sorry.

09:52.243 --> 09:53.418
[door opens]

09:59.773 --> 10:02.297
Oh, I'm not gonna
leave you in the lurch.

10:02.384 --> 10:05.779
- I'll do one more case.
- Do up your seat belt.

10:31.456 --> 10:32.719
[indistinct radio chatter]

10:34.546 --> 10:35.896
Van Pelt,
you come with me.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.549
You guys talk
to the first responders.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.551
See what they got.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.380
Hey, the apartment's upstairs.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.774
We have a female Caucasian,
late 30's.

10:44.861 --> 10:46.602
Ran license down already.
It's a fake.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.778
- We're calling her Jane Doe.
- Who found the body?

10:48.865 --> 10:50.998
The building manager noticed
her door was open overnight.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.829
Last one down to the left.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.004
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.396
[cat mews]

11:13.629 --> 11:14.761
[mews]

11:31.560 --> 11:32.822
[Jane]
'Mm-hmm.'

11:36.043 --> 11:38.219
- What's your take?
- Hit with a stun gun.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.264
Then suffocated
with the cushion.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.878
And they were looking
for something obviously.

11:44.965 --> 11:48.708
- Did they find it, Grace?
- 'Um, it's impossible to tell.'

11:48.795 --> 11:51.798
Well, it seems they looked
everywhere possible. Yes?

11:51.885 --> 11:53.190
Yeah.

11:53.277 --> 11:55.323
So we can assume
that they didn't find it

11:55.410 --> 11:57.281
whatever itis.

11:57.368 --> 11:58.761
How so?

11:58.848 --> 12:00.110
Well, let's say
there's a hundred places

12:00.197 --> 12:01.546
to look for a thing.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.287
How likely is it
that you will find it

12:03.374 --> 12:05.855
in the hundredth place you look?
Not very likely, right?

12:05.942 --> 12:06.900
What else you got?

12:06.987 --> 12:09.337
Um...no drug paraphernalia.

12:09.424 --> 12:13.167
No condoms or other items
suggesting prostitution.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.386
So...maybe a personal crime?

12:15.473 --> 12:18.433
- A husband or lover?
- Bravo, Grace.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.783
Wrong, I expect, but very
well reasoned, nonetheless.

12:28.922 --> 12:31.925
Thank you, all.
Appreciate it.

12:32.012 --> 12:34.144
Nothing off the car, but we'll
have the lab boys take a look.

12:34.231 --> 12:35.667
It's still registered
to the previous owner.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.278
Sold it for cash
six months ago.

12:37.365 --> 12:41.369
So basically we know
nothing about her. Nice start.

12:41.456 --> 12:43.153
She's a law-abiding
middle-class housewife

12:43.240 --> 12:44.633
that did something bad

12:44.720 --> 12:47.070
something she feels
terribly guilty about.

12:47.157 --> 12:49.290
Guilty enough
to make her run away and hide.

12:51.379 --> 12:52.772
Hey! That's evidence.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.817
- You know the drill.
- Meh.

12:54.904 --> 12:58.865
If you put "Bullfrogs win
high school basketball trophy"

12:58.952 --> 13:00.649
into a search engine

13:00.736 --> 13:03.434
we will find
Jane Doe's home.

13:03.521 --> 13:06.002
- Can I take a look at that?
- Sure.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.483
[Rigsby]
'It's a working truck.
Dad must be in construction.'

13:08.570 --> 13:09.963
Or something like that.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.574
""Bayshore Courier,"
April 2006.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.228
"County finals,
Lady Bullfrogs dominate

13:14.315 --> 13:16.056
injury-plagued Panthers."

13:16.143 --> 13:17.971
If they list the players,
cross-check the surnames

13:18.058 --> 13:19.973
with other articles from the
same newspaper in the last year

13:20.060 --> 13:21.844
using the word disappearance.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.020
If we leave now, we can be in
Bayshore in a couple of hours.

13:24.107 --> 13:26.806
Uh, we need a little more
than Lady Bullfrogs to go on.

[Van Pelt]
'"Bayshore Courier"
of June this year.'

13:30.810 --> 13:34.074
Headline is
"Police no closer to Dunninger."

13:34.161 --> 13:36.380
"Since her disappearance last
month, Bayshore PD have been

13:36.467 --> 13:40.036
"unable to locate 43-year-old

'"accused of stealing
nearly a million dollars'

from her employers,
The Jaffe Printing Group."

13:43.953 --> 13:47.739
- Mm.
- Okay. Bayshore it is then.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.568
So the killer must've been
looking for the million bucks.

13:50.655 --> 13:51.743
[Rigsby]
If she had a million bucks,
why would she live

13:51.831 --> 13:53.484
in a dump like this?

13:53.571 --> 13:55.008
[Jane]
Before we get on the freeway
it'd be good

13:55.095 --> 13:56.357
to take a little drive
around the neighborhood.

13:56.444 --> 13:58.489
It'd be good to find
an empty house for sale.

13:58.576 --> 13:59.751
Why would that be good?

13:59.839 --> 14:04.104
Oh...I'm thinking of
moving here.

14:04.191 --> 14:06.802
No secrets, Jane.
No lies. No tricks.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.239
No surprises. The truth.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.328
Oh? Since when
is that the rule?

14:11.415 --> 14:13.200
Since I said so.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.593
- Or else what?
- You're off the unit.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.814
That's not leverage.
This is my last case, remember?

14:18.901 --> 14:21.338
The only reason I'm still here
is 'cause I'm worried about

14:21.425 --> 14:24.211
how you guys would cope
without me.

14:24.298 --> 14:27.301
Oh, really? So we're
lost without you, are we?

14:27.388 --> 14:30.565
Well, yeah.
Let's be honest here.

14:30.652 --> 14:31.871
- Let's go.
- Hey!

14:31.958 --> 14:33.263
Drive. Go.

14:34.177 --> 14:35.744
Wait. This..

14:51.325 --> 14:52.456
[sighs]

14:53.980 --> 14:55.155
Whoa!

14:55.242 --> 14:57.722
[tires squeal]

14:57.809 --> 15:01.509
- What'd you say to them?
- Uh, nothing, really.

15:01.596 --> 15:03.250
Total overreaction.

15:03.337 --> 15:04.512
'Yeah.'

15:07.558 --> 15:09.691
We need to find
a house for sale.

15:11.606 --> 15:12.781
Okay.

15:23.096 --> 15:25.402
Ah, there's a sign.

15:29.754 --> 15:30.930
Perfect.

16:15.235 --> 16:17.846
Are you gonna tell me
what that's about?

16:17.933 --> 16:21.197
Uh...wouldn't you
rather it be a surprise?

16:21.284 --> 16:22.416
No.

16:24.244 --> 16:26.724
Oh! Oh, look, look.
Strawberries.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.734
- Strawberries?
- Mm.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.609
See?

16:41.696 --> 16:45.178
- How good is that?
- Mm. Good.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.484
Cho, Rigsby, start
canvassing the neighbors.

16:47.571 --> 16:49.747
Van pelt, come with me.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.271
Uh, I..

16:51.358 --> 16:52.663
Lisbon, uh..

16:55.579 --> 16:59.018
I'm sorry for
what I said to you before.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.846
Can I please
continue working with you?

17:01.933 --> 17:04.066
I thought you were quitting.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.546
You know I didn't mean that.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.113
So the job isworthwhile, is it?

17:07.200 --> 17:09.811
It's not that.
I mean, it's not that at all.

17:09.898 --> 17:11.291
It's just..

17:16.818 --> 17:19.168
I have nothing else to do.

17:22.258 --> 17:25.044
No jokes. From now on,
there have to be boundaries.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.654
Agreed.

17:26.741 --> 17:29.178
I need to know that you can do
your work and be effective

17:29.265 --> 17:31.180
without creating a mess
that I have to clean up.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.139
No mess, I swear.

17:34.966 --> 17:37.534
On that basis,
you can remain with the unit.

17:37.621 --> 17:39.101
Thank you.

17:43.410 --> 17:44.541
Here.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.632
[male #2]
'So how did she die?'

17:48.719 --> 17:51.374
It was a homicide,
but she didn't suffer.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.289
We don't have
any suspects yet.

17:53.376 --> 17:54.943
Where was she?

17:55.030 --> 17:58.251
She was living alone in a small
apartment in Twenty Palms.

17:58.338 --> 18:00.731
I thought she'd be living it up
in Mexico or someplace.

18:00.818 --> 18:03.169
- She was always--
- Stop it.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.694
I need to lie down.

18:06.781 --> 18:09.262
Okay, champ, let's roll.

18:15.224 --> 18:17.270
I'm making some tea.
Would you like a cup?

18:17.357 --> 18:19.402
- No, thank you.
- Oh, oh, I-I'd love a cup.

18:19.489 --> 18:20.621
Thanks.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.278
Let me get you a blanket.
I'll be right back.

18:29.891 --> 18:31.632
Ansel, uh, had cancer.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.721
He's totally better now,
but still weak.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.418
It's in remission?

18:35.505 --> 18:39.857
Gone. Hundred percent.
We were blessed.

18:39.944 --> 18:42.338
Even the doctors were amazed.

18:44.775 --> 18:47.648
Thank you.
Tell me about your mother.

18:47.735 --> 18:50.825
Sure. I'll tell you.

18:50.912 --> 18:52.348
Stealing all that money
and running off

18:52.435 --> 18:54.742
that was just
the icing on the cake.

18:54.829 --> 18:57.527
When Ansel got cancer,
her way of coping?

18:57.614 --> 19:01.575
Painkillers
and a sleazebag lover.

19:01.662 --> 19:04.230
That's mom.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.275
Did you know
her lover's name?

19:06.362 --> 19:08.147
Bodhi Andros.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.847
How we found out?

19:12.934 --> 19:17.721
[scoffs]
Ansel goes to meet
his mom at her yogarobics class.

19:17.808 --> 19:21.899
He finds her banging
the teacher in his office.

19:21.986 --> 19:24.641
- Can you imagine?
- Then what happened?

19:24.728 --> 19:26.600
She did her dance.

19:26.687 --> 19:29.820
She's so ashamed,
she's so sorry

19:29.907 --> 19:31.866
she's changed.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.955
Whatever.

19:34.042 --> 19:36.740
And dad was halfway
to forgiving her.

19:36.827 --> 19:39.221
He can't help it.
He loves her.

19:39.308 --> 19:42.572
But you don't...love her?

19:42.659 --> 19:44.574
She...never had time for me.

19:44.661 --> 19:49.057
So...I could always see through
her charm, you know.

19:49.144 --> 19:52.234
- To the selfish cow beneath--
- 'Kessie!'

19:52.321 --> 19:54.889
Don't talk that way.
She loved you.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.676
Look, she's dead.
Show some respect.

20:05.378 --> 20:09.512
She was a beautiful soul,
full of joy and, and big dreams.

20:09.599 --> 20:12.863
And reality
just kinda beat her down.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.038
But here's the thing.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.736
'It was only because the theft'

20:15.823 --> 20:19.479
was in the news that
the doctors at Cedars of Zion

20:19.566 --> 20:22.133
heard about Ansel
and reached out to help us.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.572
'They took him on for free
and they saved his life.'

20:25.659 --> 20:28.705
Saved his life when everybody
said there was no hope.

20:28.792 --> 20:31.142
'So..'

20:31.230 --> 20:34.624
...you know,
God works in mysterious ways.

20:34.711 --> 20:37.671
Well, you know
God doesn't necessarily--

20:37.758 --> 20:40.674
Thank you very much
for your time.

20:40.761 --> 20:43.372
Yeah. Thank you.

20:43.459 --> 20:44.895
Very nice tea.

20:47.594 --> 20:49.204
Oh, uh, I almost forgot.

20:49.291 --> 20:52.120
Do either of you
know a Miles Thorsen?

20:52.207 --> 20:53.904
- Uh, no, I don't think so.
- No.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.819
Sure?

20:55.906 --> 20:57.778
- Yeah.
- Yes.

20:57.865 --> 20:58.953
Alright.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.131
Ansel.

21:03.218 --> 21:05.046
Hey, Ansel!

21:07.091 --> 21:09.398
You know Miles Thorsen?

21:09.485 --> 21:10.878
No.

21:10.965 --> 21:12.140
Okay.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.230
Bye.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.623
Thank you.

21:18.755 --> 21:21.628
- Who's Miles Thorsen?
- No one in particular.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.804
This is what
I'm talking about.

21:23.891 --> 21:27.198
Oh. No, me, too. Y-you want
no fuss, no mess, right?

21:27.286 --> 21:29.244
I am casting
a wide, invisible net.

21:29.331 --> 21:31.290
The killer won't even know
he's in it until it's too late.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.117
Miles Thorsen
is an invisible net?

21:33.204 --> 21:34.858
Yes, he is.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.469
We got an address
on Bodhi Andros.

21:36.556 --> 21:38.471
Cho, Rigsby,
go and check him out.

21:38.558 --> 21:39.820
Van Pelt,
get on the money trail.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.517
Somebody's got
that million dollars.

21:41.604 --> 21:43.432
Start with the dad
and the daughter.

21:43.519 --> 21:45.434
See if they've been spending
money they shouldn't have.

21:45.521 --> 21:48.611
- They looked clean to me.
- Oh, did they? Okay, great.

21:48.698 --> 21:53.050
- Just let them be.
- I don't...I'll check 'em out.

21:53.137 --> 21:55.444
Okay, come on. Let's get
back to Sacramento, grumpy.

21:55.531 --> 21:58.012
- What's the hurry?
- I have a meeting. With Bosco.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.796
Oh. Good luck.

21:59.883 --> 22:01.798
[sitar music]

22:01.885 --> 22:03.191
Great class, guys.

22:03.278 --> 22:05.454
Hey, and let's use
that focus we found

22:05.541 --> 22:08.936
throughout the week, okay?
Namaste.

22:09.023 --> 22:11.547
Namaste.
Okay, thank you.

22:11.634 --> 22:12.983
[music stops]

22:15.377 --> 22:17.161
- I'm looking for Bodhi Andros.
- Crap!

22:17.248 --> 22:20.426
Yeah, his office is upstairs,
to the right.

22:20.513 --> 22:22.036
[Cho]
Thank you.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.038
Remember that time
you said you'd been in juvie?

22:24.125 --> 22:25.387
Yep.

22:25.474 --> 22:27.171
You never said
what you got sent there for.

22:27.258 --> 22:29.217
It's gang stuff.

22:29.304 --> 22:31.567
You were in a gang?
What was the name of the gang?

22:31.654 --> 22:33.352
Avon Park Playboys.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.136
[chuckles]
Avon Park Playboys?

22:35.223 --> 22:36.877
I didn't choose the name.

22:36.964 --> 22:38.269
[door shuts]

22:41.621 --> 22:44.667
And, uh, what kind of stuff
did the playboys do?

22:44.754 --> 22:47.017
- Nothin' good.
- Like what?

22:47.104 --> 22:48.149
Nothing you need to know about.

22:48.236 --> 22:49.803
Mm, fair enough. Your call.

22:49.890 --> 22:51.935
See, I don't think
partners should have secrets

22:52.022 --> 22:53.284
but your call.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.851
Like you don't
have any secrets.

22:54.938 --> 22:57.071
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what I mean.

22:57.158 --> 22:59.900
Hey, you in there.
Police.

22:59.987 --> 23:03.120
CBI. Very slowly, stand up.

23:03.207 --> 23:06.254
[Andros]
'I'm unarmed, man.
I have no weapon.'

23:06.341 --> 23:07.864
Well, that's great.

23:07.951 --> 23:09.953
So come out slowly,
hands on your head

23:10.040 --> 23:13.000
and we won't hurt you, promise.

23:13.087 --> 23:15.959
'Comin' out now.
Don't shoot.'

23:19.746 --> 23:23.140
Morning, sir.
You Bodhi Andros?

23:23.227 --> 23:25.578
- Yes, I am.
- Turn around.

23:34.891 --> 23:37.590
Hey. Sorry, I'm late.
Bad traffic.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.983
- What are you having?
- What areyouhaving?

23:40.070 --> 23:42.246
Well, I'll have
a bottle of water, thanks.

23:42.333 --> 23:45.598
Uh, dog with kraut,
bottle of water.

23:51.168 --> 23:52.605
Thank you.

23:55.346 --> 23:57.784
- Keep it.
- Oh, thank you.

24:00.177 --> 24:01.527
Well, I'm not gonna lie.

24:01.614 --> 24:04.617
I'm not happy
I'm off the Red John case.

24:04.704 --> 24:06.923
You might be right.

24:07.010 --> 24:10.013
Fresh set of eyes is
maybe what's needed.

24:10.100 --> 24:13.103
Here's the thing, Sam,
if I may.

24:13.190 --> 24:14.888
I know this case.

24:14.975 --> 24:16.629
I can be
a very good resource for you.

24:16.716 --> 24:20.633
If we could just come to
some kind of understanding.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.287
You want me to, uh,
keep you up to date on the case?

24:23.374 --> 24:24.767
Yeah, sure.

24:24.854 --> 24:26.465
Tell you about fresh leads,
etcetera.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.858
Yeah, let's just keep
an open line of communication.

24:32.079 --> 24:34.081
- Mm.
- Good.

24:34.168 --> 24:38.520
Mm...my wife has me on a diet.

24:38.607 --> 24:40.304
Mm-hmm.

24:40.391 --> 24:42.045
This is like
committin' adultery here.

24:42.132 --> 24:43.307
[chuckles]

24:46.659 --> 24:48.530
Let me communicate this to you.

24:50.706 --> 24:53.187
You're a party entertainer.

24:53.274 --> 24:55.145
A clown.

24:55.232 --> 24:56.712
Fresh leads?

24:56.799 --> 24:58.235
I wouldn't tell you
where the bathroom is

24:58.322 --> 24:59.933
if your ass was on fire.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.151
[chuckles]

25:02.631 --> 25:03.893
Do we have
a good understanding now?

25:03.980 --> 25:05.547
I understand you.

25:05.634 --> 25:09.420
It may take you some time
to understand me.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.815
You're filled with equal parts
self-loathing and self-love.

25:12.902 --> 25:14.600
You're addicted to control.

25:14.687 --> 25:16.427
You're terrified
of confinement.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.343
Who's my favorite Beatle? Huh?

25:19.430 --> 25:21.215
Your wife wanted you
to quit the psychic trade.

25:21.302 --> 25:22.521
She begged you to stop

25:22.608 --> 25:23.957
but you were
making too much money.

25:24.044 --> 25:25.654
You were havin'
too much fun.

25:25.741 --> 25:29.615
You can still hear
her pleading with you.

25:29.702 --> 25:31.051
How am I doin'?

25:31.138 --> 25:32.792
You read the interviews
in my case file.

25:32.879 --> 25:36.317
You can read.
Very impressive.

25:36.404 --> 25:38.537
Look, Patrick

25:38.624 --> 25:41.365
I'm sorry to be
so blunt with you.

25:41.452 --> 25:42.497
Really?

25:47.589 --> 25:49.983
You're not a detective.
You're a victim.

25:59.079 --> 26:01.864
[machines whirring]

26:05.999 --> 26:07.914
You never said,
how was your meeting with Bosco?

26:08.001 --> 26:09.306
What? I can't hear you!

26:09.393 --> 26:11.482
I said,
how did it go with Bosco?

26:11.570 --> 26:12.919
I can't.

26:17.314 --> 26:19.360
How did it go with Bosco?

26:19.447 --> 26:23.059
Oh. Uh...good.
It was, uh, it was very good.

26:23.146 --> 26:25.845
We had a frank exchange
of views.

26:25.932 --> 26:27.020
So he's gonna
keep us in the loop?

26:27.107 --> 26:28.674
- No.
- No?

26:28.761 --> 26:31.154
Wouldn't direct me to the
bathroom if my ass was on fire.

26:31.241 --> 26:32.373
[Lisbon chuckles]

26:32.460 --> 26:33.896
- Think that's funny?
- Yeah.

26:33.983 --> 26:35.855
So that's Mrs. Jaffe over there.

26:35.942 --> 26:37.291
- Thank you.
- Sure.

26:39.380 --> 26:41.034
What are you gonna do?

26:41.121 --> 26:45.168
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

26:45.255 --> 26:48.563
If you sit down by the riverbank
and wait long enough

26:48.650 --> 26:51.610
you will see the bodies
of your enemies float by.

26:54.482 --> 26:55.788
Shall we?

27:01.402 --> 27:02.838
Agent Lisbon, is it?

27:02.925 --> 27:04.666
I'm Rhonda Jaffe,
company chairwoman.

27:04.753 --> 27:06.233
This is my colleague, Mr. Jane.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.800
Hello.

27:07.887 --> 27:09.584
Thank you so much for
taking the time to talk to us.

27:09.671 --> 27:11.325
Oh, not at all.

27:11.412 --> 27:13.719
And you wanted to meet with my
finance director, Greg Humphrey?

27:13.806 --> 27:15.068
- Yes, ma'am.
- Alright.

27:15.155 --> 27:18.071
Well, let's speak in my office.

27:18.158 --> 27:19.550
Did you know
Monica Dunninger?

27:19.638 --> 27:21.727
Oh, yeah.
I know everyone on staff.

27:21.814 --> 27:24.817
So sad. The whole thing
is just so sad.

27:24.904 --> 27:26.253
The poor woman.

27:26.340 --> 27:29.038
More troubled than conniving,
I'm sure.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.650
And you know,
it's not the money.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.956
It's more the loss of trust.

27:34.043 --> 27:36.089
This is very, very
much a family firm.

27:36.176 --> 27:38.526
And my father
always used to say

27:38.613 --> 27:42.138
Jaffe Printing is about values,
not about machinery.

27:42.225 --> 27:44.184
Do you know Miles Thorsen?

27:44.271 --> 27:46.055
Miles Thorsen? No.

27:46.142 --> 27:48.275
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

27:48.362 --> 27:49.929
Seriously, stop it.

27:50.016 --> 27:52.409
Relax.

27:52.496 --> 27:55.238
I saved her life.
She resents me.

27:55.325 --> 27:56.675
Oh, really?

28:00.374 --> 28:02.942
[beep]
Jill?

28:03.029 --> 28:04.160
[beep]

28:05.335 --> 28:06.728
[beep]
'Jill?'

28:06.815 --> 28:08.861
'Jill, where has
Greg Humphrey gone to?'

28:08.948 --> 28:10.558
'He's supposed to be in here.'

28:10.645 --> 28:12.386
[beep]
'Hello?'

28:12.473 --> 28:14.040
[beep]

28:14.127 --> 28:15.389
[male #3]
'Hey.'

28:15.476 --> 28:17.696
Humble apologies.

28:17.783 --> 28:19.741
Small crisis
on the inventory desk.

28:19.828 --> 28:23.092
Solved. Uh, Greg Humphrey.
Good to meet you.

28:23.179 --> 28:24.790
Patrick Jane.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.661
We're investigating
the murder of Monica Dunninger.

28:26.748 --> 28:30.534
Yes. Terrible. Horrible.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.623
You were her direct supervisor,
is that right?

28:32.711 --> 28:36.105
I know what you're gonna say
and yes, yes, it was my fault

28:36.192 --> 28:37.933
that she stole from us.
Mea culpa.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.979
I-I should've known.

28:40.066 --> 28:43.417
Greg is like family practically.
We all make mistakes.

28:43.504 --> 28:46.637
We live, we learn, we move on.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.596
Uh, can you explain
to us how she did it?

28:48.683 --> 28:49.684
In layman's terms?

28:49.771 --> 28:51.381
Uh, been there, done that

28:51.468 --> 28:53.906
with the top men
from the FBI Financial Unit.

28:53.993 --> 28:56.299
Do we really need
to go over it again?

28:56.386 --> 28:59.607
- Yes.
- No problem.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.265
Thank you.

29:07.093 --> 29:08.747
What exactly
was her position here?

29:08.834 --> 29:10.661
Assistant office manager.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.186
She kept
the petty cash accounts.

29:13.273 --> 29:15.449
Coffee and doughnut monitor
essentially.

29:15.536 --> 29:18.800
This was her office.

29:18.887 --> 29:21.194
How did she manage
to steal so much money?

29:21.281 --> 29:23.544
When the accounting and
finance systems were integrated

29:23.631 --> 29:26.677
nobody thought to firewall
the petty cash accounts.

29:26.765 --> 29:30.769
Monica acquired user access
to the transactional sites

29:30.856 --> 29:32.205
and created a false vendor.

29:32.292 --> 29:34.860
I didn't think she had
the brains to be honest.

29:34.947 --> 29:37.514
We don't know
exactly how she did it

29:37.601 --> 29:40.387
because she
fried her hard drive

29:40.474 --> 29:42.389
and she took
her accounts book with her.

29:42.476 --> 29:45.000
Are we about to look at
a whole bunch of numbers?

29:45.087 --> 29:47.046
Probably.

29:47.133 --> 29:48.874
Alright.
I'll wait in the car.

29:48.961 --> 29:50.092
Go.

29:51.964 --> 29:55.445
Do you know a man
named Miles Thorsen?

29:55.532 --> 29:59.058
- No.
- You sure? Think about it.

29:59.145 --> 30:01.495
- I'm sure. Who is he?
- Never mind.

30:01.582 --> 30:03.802
[Lisbon]
'Please continue.'

30:03.889 --> 30:05.542
[cell phone rings]
Would you excuse me?

30:05.629 --> 30:07.283
Hmm.

30:07.370 --> 30:08.807
[Van Pelt]
'Boss, I think
I found something.'

30:08.894 --> 30:10.809
The victim's daughter,
Kessie Dunninger

30:10.896 --> 30:13.463
she handles the family money,
pays the bills.

30:13.550 --> 30:15.117
Five months ago,
she stopped paying the rent

30:15.204 --> 30:17.337
by standing order,
switched to cash.

30:17.424 --> 30:20.427
Same thing with
the utility bills. Paid in cash.

30:20.514 --> 30:22.559
Nice work.
Go and talk to her.

30:22.646 --> 30:24.126
If she doesn't have
a good answer, bring her in.

30:24.213 --> 30:26.520
Will do, boss. Yes!

30:37.313 --> 30:39.838
Why did you hide from us, Bodhi?

30:39.925 --> 30:42.841
Fear, man. Fear.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.408
I've been frightened
for my life ever since I heard.

30:45.495 --> 30:47.889
- Why?
- Who killed her?

30:47.976 --> 30:50.109
Either it was her
goober husband finally snapped

30:50.196 --> 30:51.545
'which puts me next in line'

30:51.632 --> 30:53.112
Or it's whoever she
went into business with

30:53.199 --> 30:54.809
and maybe they think
I know too much.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.593
She was in business
with someone?

30:56.680 --> 30:59.770
Just before she disappeared,
she came by to see me

30:59.858 --> 31:02.077
told me she made
a business deal with someone

31:02.164 --> 31:04.471
that would
make everything alright.

31:04.558 --> 31:06.647
A business deal?
Were those the words she used?

31:06.734 --> 31:08.257
Yep.

31:08.344 --> 31:10.912
She was starting
a new day in her life

31:10.999 --> 31:12.871
and wanted to
make amends and apologize

31:12.958 --> 31:15.308
for being
such a pain in the butt.

31:15.395 --> 31:16.918
- Which she was.
- How so?

31:17.005 --> 31:21.096
She was way too deep
into her family

31:21.183 --> 31:22.489
and to her kids
and all that crap.

31:22.576 --> 31:25.709
- Mm-hmm.
- Loved those kids.

31:25.796 --> 31:28.669
Why do I wanna talk
to her about her sick boy?

31:28.756 --> 31:32.194
- Like I can help?
- You're not a doctor.

31:32.281 --> 31:35.328
Exactly. When we
were caught by that kid

31:35.415 --> 31:38.461
she just...went to pieces,
you know?

31:38.548 --> 31:40.899
And I'm like..

31:40.986 --> 31:45.294
...don't get so down
on yourself.

31:45.381 --> 31:48.819
You gotta loveyoueven if
you're a total screw-up, right?

31:48.907 --> 31:53.781
The greatest...love...of all.

31:53.868 --> 31:56.218
Whitney was right, as usual.

31:59.874 --> 32:01.789
Right.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.573
Do you know a man
named Miles Thorsen?

32:03.660 --> 32:04.835
No. Who's he?

32:04.923 --> 32:06.359
I don't know.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.639
Is that enough sugar?

32:25.726 --> 32:27.206
Yes. Thank you.

32:28.903 --> 32:32.385
So, Kessie,
tell me about the money.

32:32.472 --> 32:36.215
About a month after she ran off,
mom called me.

32:36.302 --> 32:38.391
Said she wanted
to help us out

32:38.478 --> 32:40.045
wanted to know
how Ansel was doing.

32:40.132 --> 32:45.659
She loves us so much,
blah, blah, blah.

32:45.746 --> 32:48.792
I told her to go to hell,
and I hung up.

32:48.879 --> 32:53.188
Two days later, I got a letter
with $5,000 in cash inside.

32:53.275 --> 32:54.668
[Van Pelt]
Any message?

32:54.755 --> 32:57.584
"With love, mom."

32:57.671 --> 32:59.325
That was it.

32:59.412 --> 33:01.892
'What was I supposed to do,
give it to the police?'

33:01.980 --> 33:03.633
Actually, yes.

33:03.720 --> 33:08.682
Well, I didn't.
We really needed the money.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.553
Did you ever tell your dad
about the money?

33:10.640 --> 33:11.815
No.

33:13.295 --> 33:14.775
No.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.646
How often
did she send you money?

33:16.733 --> 33:19.084
$5,000 every month.

33:19.171 --> 33:21.651
Did you ever
write back to her?

33:21.738 --> 33:23.218
No.

33:23.305 --> 33:24.437
I like her for this.

33:24.524 --> 33:27.048
- How so?
- She despises mom.

33:27.135 --> 33:28.745
'Mom's got a million
stolen dollars'

33:28.832 --> 33:30.312
'gets in contact secretly.'

33:30.399 --> 33:32.488
- Do the math.
- Maybe.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.795
No? What's your take?

33:34.882 --> 33:36.623
I'd be guessing.
Could be anybody.

33:36.710 --> 33:40.105
Not anybody. You didn't do it.
I didn't do it.

33:40.192 --> 33:41.584
You're distracted.

33:41.671 --> 33:43.238
You're thinking
about Bosco and Red John.

33:43.325 --> 33:45.240
Focus on the job at hand.

33:45.327 --> 33:48.200
You're glad Bosco has
the Red John case, aren't you?

33:48.287 --> 33:50.680
Bosco is a good agent.
He's as good as they come.

33:50.767 --> 33:52.639
It might not be
such a bad thing

33:52.726 --> 33:54.641
that we're off the case
for a while. We got too close.

33:54.728 --> 33:55.859
Is that what
your shrink tells you?

33:55.946 --> 33:57.296
Everybody tells me that.

33:57.383 --> 33:58.949
But your shrink did
tell you that, didn't he?

33:59.037 --> 34:01.387
Okay, may-maybe you're right.
Maybe, maybe that's the truth.

34:01.474 --> 34:03.345
Maybe we did get a little
too close. I'm not so sure.

34:03.432 --> 34:05.608
- But I'll think about it.
- Liar.

34:05.695 --> 34:08.611
I've got a deposition.
See that box over there?

34:08.698 --> 34:10.744
It's got Monica Dunninger's
possessions in it.

34:10.831 --> 34:12.833
Go through it,
see what you can see.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.313
Yes, ma'am.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.147
Uh, who wants to come
with me out to Twenty Palms

34:22.234 --> 34:23.713
to catch the killer?

34:23.800 --> 34:26.281
Did Lisbon okay this?

34:26.368 --> 34:27.282
Of course.

34:39.990 --> 34:42.036
- What is this place?
- Guess.

34:42.123 --> 34:44.821
- It's Miles Thorsen's house.
- Exactly.

34:44.908 --> 34:48.347
- Who's Miles Thorsen?
- Oh, uh..

34:48.434 --> 34:49.696
I have no idea.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.654
[Rigsby]
'Alright, fine.
Don't tell me.'

34:59.967 --> 35:01.751
- Isn't that your number?
- Uh, yeah, that's my number.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.231
That's in case the killer
gets here before us.

35:03.318 --> 35:05.799
That way he'll call us.

35:05.886 --> 35:08.236
What's that over there?

35:10.108 --> 35:11.457
Hey, we have no warrant.

35:11.544 --> 35:12.719
Don't you hear
someone yelling in there?

35:12.806 --> 35:14.242
No.

35:14.329 --> 35:16.288
- I heard something.
- There's no yelling.

35:16.375 --> 35:19.552
- I have perfect hearing.
- I could swear I heard someone.

35:26.689 --> 35:29.562
[sighs]
Okay, so what are we doing here?

35:29.649 --> 35:34.784
Everybody involved is wondering
who Miles Thorsen is, huh?

35:34.871 --> 35:39.049
The killer will be
doubly curious. Triply, even.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.182
Maybe mysterious Miles Thorsen
has what the killer

35:41.269 --> 35:43.445
is looking for,
what he didn't find.

35:43.532 --> 35:45.447
When they look him up, they'll
learn there's a Miles Thorsen

35:45.534 --> 35:47.667
who lives right around the
corner from Monica. Hey, presto.

35:47.754 --> 35:49.103
This is exactly
the kind of stuff

35:49.190 --> 35:50.539
that boss was talking about.

35:50.626 --> 35:53.325
She didn't okay this at all,
did she?

35:53.412 --> 35:55.022
So shoot me.

35:55.109 --> 35:56.937
'"The Fax Machine Revolution'

35:57.024 --> 36:00.506
'The little box
that's changing our world."'

36:00.593 --> 36:02.943
Why would Monica Dunninger
be reading this book?

36:03.030 --> 36:04.988
You, Cho, shouldn't
enable this kind of crap.

36:05.075 --> 36:06.425
We're not doing anything wrong.
What's the problem?

36:06.512 --> 36:08.601
Uh, burglary, trespassing

36:08.688 --> 36:11.038
willful damage to property.

36:11.125 --> 36:13.475
- The door was open.
- Uh, no, it wasn't.

36:13.562 --> 36:17.000
- Aha! Of course.
- What?

36:17.087 --> 36:18.524
Rigsby, you're right.
You shouldn't be here.

36:18.611 --> 36:21.091
Let us take this.
You go find the nearest library.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.964
Why?

36:24.051 --> 36:26.619
Your punishment for being a
wuss is I'm not gonna tell ya.

36:26.706 --> 36:29.317
- Oh, come on.
- No, I'm not gonna tell you.

36:29.404 --> 36:32.320
Fine. Fine. Whatever.

36:32.407 --> 36:34.888
- Call when you're there.
- 'Oh, ho!'

36:34.975 --> 36:37.020
[door opens and closes]

36:37.107 --> 36:39.327
- So what's the gag?
- Oh, there's no gag.

36:39.414 --> 36:40.459
Solve the case.

36:40.546 --> 36:41.895
I thought you already did that.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.940
I thought that's why
we're waiting here.

36:44.027 --> 36:47.466
Nope. This is, uh..

36:47.553 --> 36:49.250
Well..

36:49.337 --> 36:51.470
This is more of
a fishing expedition.

36:51.557 --> 36:54.908
You know, maybe we get a bite.
Maybe we don't.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.649
That's the fun of it.

36:56.736 --> 37:00.087
We just sit back, relax,
dangle our feet in the water.

37:01.306 --> 37:03.699
[instrumental music]

37:12.926 --> 37:16.016
Now, this guy predicted
that by the year 2000

37:16.103 --> 37:19.367
every American household
will have a fax machine.

37:20.977 --> 37:23.023
Can you believe that?

37:23.110 --> 37:25.373
I had a fax machine.

37:25.460 --> 37:26.679
You?

37:26.766 --> 37:28.028
Yeah.

37:28.115 --> 37:31.510
Wow. Nostradamus
of office equipment.

37:31.597 --> 37:32.859
See, this is why
I don't like fishing.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.513
We're not
gonna catch anything.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.037
We have some very tasty bait.
I'm very confident.

37:37.124 --> 37:39.387
Did you consider that the
killer found the money already?

37:39.474 --> 37:40.780
I don't think it was money
they were looking for.

37:40.867 --> 37:42.912
I don't think
Monica ever had it.

37:42.999 --> 37:44.827
Well, what did she have then?
And who has the money?

37:44.914 --> 37:48.004
[male #4]
'Great bones,
original mid century detail.'

37:48.091 --> 37:52.095
Great new copper piping that--

37:52.182 --> 37:53.445
Hello.

37:53.532 --> 37:56.317
Did you have
a fax machine in 2000?

37:56.404 --> 37:57.971
Um...hi?

37:58.058 --> 37:59.320
No cause for alarm, sir.

37:59.407 --> 38:02.149
We're law enforcement officers.
CBI.

38:05.326 --> 38:07.850
"Kimball Cho." Okay.

38:07.937 --> 38:10.505
What are you doing here,
Kimball? Is there a problem?

38:10.592 --> 38:12.028
It's an ongoing investigation,
sir.

38:12.115 --> 38:14.161
We can't give out any details.

38:14.248 --> 38:16.163
Grisly homicide, though.

38:18.557 --> 38:21.995
Why don't we take a look at that
duplex on Royston? Shall we?

38:22.082 --> 38:23.997
That's a good call.

38:28.567 --> 38:30.482
- Damn it.
- Relax.

38:30.569 --> 38:33.311
- He got my name.
- Well, you spoke the truth.

38:33.398 --> 38:35.095
We are an ongoing investigation.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.966
Yeah, but we're supposed
to be working 100% straight.

38:37.053 --> 38:38.925
Thisis not that.

38:46.193 --> 38:49.239
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.
Wrong address.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.806
Whoa! Whoa! Rhonda!

38:51.938 --> 38:53.287
Come back.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.555
I'm here out
of curiosity, that's all.

39:00.642 --> 39:02.078
Well, of course.

39:05.865 --> 39:08.302
I've got nothing else
to say without my lawyer.

39:08.389 --> 39:10.957
You don't need
to say anything.

39:11.044 --> 39:13.568
I knew it was you
from the start.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.527
Thanks for sharing.

39:15.614 --> 39:19.052
Well, when I say I-I knew it was
her, I-I mean I-I guessed.

39:19.139 --> 39:21.663
I subconsciously thought
it was her

39:21.750 --> 39:24.884
when I saw a photo of her
holding a large check

39:24.971 --> 39:28.278
outside Cedars of Zion.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.193
It was you that
stole the million dollars

39:30.280 --> 39:32.457
from your own company.

39:32.544 --> 39:34.676
Why would I do that?

39:34.763 --> 39:36.635
Well, degenerate gambling
would be my guess.

39:36.722 --> 39:39.899
'But whatever your problem is,
when threatened with exposure'

39:39.986 --> 39:42.815
you made a deal
with poor Monica.

39:42.902 --> 39:45.992
'If she'd take
the blame and disappear'

39:46.079 --> 39:49.561
you'd get Ansel into the best
cancer program in California

39:49.648 --> 39:52.346
and pay her a monthly wage
to stay gone.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.609
That's absurd.

39:54.696 --> 39:56.132
But then Ansel got cured

39:56.219 --> 39:58.483
and there's no way
Monica was gonna stay gone

39:58.570 --> 40:01.268
not much longer.

40:01.355 --> 40:03.139
Then you had to silence her.

40:03.226 --> 40:05.141
That's pure fiction.

40:05.228 --> 40:07.143
You have no proof at all.

40:07.230 --> 40:10.451
Oh. Oh.
We-we have proof. Wait.

40:10.538 --> 40:12.148
Yeah, where is it?
Here it is. Yep.

40:12.235 --> 40:14.760
[clears throat]
This is gonna be good.

40:14.847 --> 40:15.978
[dialing]

40:18.416 --> 40:21.854
Yep, I'm here.
I know, I know.

40:21.941 --> 40:24.857
"The Fax Machine Revolution"
is a library book

40:24.944 --> 40:27.947
and Monica Dunninger swapped it.

40:28.034 --> 40:30.558
Hold on. I'm checking it.

40:30.645 --> 40:32.168
Alright.

40:32.255 --> 40:34.170
Got it. Wait up.

40:38.044 --> 40:40.438
Looks like an accounts book.

40:42.918 --> 40:44.529
There's a DVD in it.

40:44.616 --> 40:48.054
[female #1]
'This is just to say that..'

40:48.141 --> 40:50.839
'...in case
something happens to me'

40:50.926 --> 40:54.190
that I swear on the Bible

40:54.277 --> 40:56.889
'that everything
in the account book'

40:56.976 --> 40:59.805
'is the truth.'

40:59.892 --> 41:01.241
I know that I've pretty much

41:01.328 --> 41:04.679
lost your love and respect
for good.

41:04.766 --> 41:08.944
'But I hope that
this deal that I've made'

41:09.031 --> 41:12.339
would help Ansel get better

41:12.426 --> 41:16.691
and will make up for some
of the hurt that I've caused.

41:18.650 --> 41:23.829
I love you all so much

41:23.916 --> 41:26.919
especially you, Kessie

41:27.006 --> 41:29.356
'even though you think I don't.'

41:31.837 --> 41:36.102
'I'm just so sorry
for this mess that I've made.'

41:38.147 --> 41:39.758
Please forgive me.

41:41.847 --> 41:42.978
'Goodbye.'

41:48.201 --> 41:50.116
The book
spells out the deal.

41:50.203 --> 41:51.944
Monica took the fall
for her boss

41:52.031 --> 41:54.990
'so that Ansel would have
the best possible treatment.'

42:05.261 --> 42:06.611
Nice work.

42:13.095 --> 42:14.401
[Kessie sobbing]

42:20.363 --> 42:21.539
Oh.

42:27.153 --> 42:30.069
Oh, hi. Sam Bosco here,
CBI Major Crimes Program.

42:30.156 --> 42:31.853
Question.

42:31.940 --> 42:35.814
How do I go about changing
my in-house access passcode?

42:35.901 --> 42:38.817
I got strong reason to
believe it's been compromised.

42:40.993 --> 42:43.386
Yeah, great.

42:43.473 --> 42:45.432
Sure. Sure, I can hold.

42:52.091 --> 42:54.484
[Jane]
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

42:57.705 --> 42:59.925
[theme music]
