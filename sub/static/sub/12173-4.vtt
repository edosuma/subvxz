that during the night,

he asked for our forgiveness.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.164
Kitchen cellar.

29:27.240 --> 29:28.446
And a tunnel under the river.

29:28.520 --> 29:29.965
They don't trust a soul in this country,

29:30.040 --> 29:33.681

one of the cellars into a strong room.

29:33.760 --> 29:34.841
Did you find someone, Arthur?

29:35.240 --> 29:36.651
Moss gave me this.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.848
Stefan Radischevsky.

29:38.920 --> 29:41.287
He's a kid from Greet,
lives in Cheltenham.

29:41.360 --> 29:45.081
Dad's a Russian. He has dreams of
owning a pub but he's got a record.

29:45.360 --> 29:47.010
- Breaking and entering.
- ARTHUR: Hmm.

29:47.080 --> 29:48.730
- And he speaks Russian?
- Yeah.

called the Masons Arms.

keeps his ears open.

off the back of a wagon, Pol.

I can't remember a fucking thing.

30:34.680 --> 30:38.002
Well, Moss tells me you were threatening
to burn down the town hall.

Oh, Tommy, we were having a laugh.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.487

the crowd around me was bigger

30:44.560 --> 30:46.244
than the crowd around Jessie Eden.

that you want and then I'll know.

about the robbery you're planning.

Not the factory robbery. The other one.

telling the women about.

report back to you faithfully.

from the Russians, are you, Tommy?

would be 150,000.

- Estimated. Yes.
- A third of 150 is 50.

- The three brothers.
